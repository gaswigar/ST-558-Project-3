then
drink
it
thus
cried
the
rash
young
fool
and
splashed
the
contents
of
his
cup
full
into
the
face
of
wilding
even
as
that
gentleman
on
his
feet
was
proposing
to
drink
to
the
eyes
of
the
young
fool
sister
the
moments
that
followed
were
full
of
interest
a
stillness
a
brooding
expectant
stillness
fell
upon
the
company
and
it
numbered
a
round
dozen
about
lord
gervase
richly
appointed
board
in
the
soft
candlelight
the
oval
table
shone
like
a
deep
brown
pool
in
which
were
reflected
the
gleaming
silver
and
sparkling
crystal
that
seemed
to
float
upon
it
blake
sucked
in
his
his
florid
face
a
thought
less
florid
than
its
wont
his
prominent
blue
eyes
a
thought
more
prominent
under
its
golden
periwig
old
nick
trenchard
wizened
countenance
was
darkened
by
a
scowl
and
his
fingers
long
swarthy
and
gnarled
drummed
fretfully
upon
the
table
portly
lord
gervase
scoresby
their
host
a
benign
and
placid
man
of
peace
detesting
turbulence
turned
crimson
now
in
wordless
rage
the
others
gaped
and
stared
some
at
young
westmacott
some
at
the
man
he
had
so
grossly
affronted
whilst
in
the
shadows
of
the
hall
a
couple
of
lacqueys
looked
on
amazed
all
teeth
and
eyes
wilding
stood
very
still
and
outwardly
impassive
the
wine
trickling
from
his
long
face
which
if
pale
was
no
paler
than
its
habit
a
vestige
of
the
smile
with
which
he
had
proposed
the
toast
still
lingering
on
his
thin
lips
though
departed
from
his
eyes
an
elegant
gentleman
was
wilding
tall
and
seeming
even
taller
by
virtue
of
his
exceeding
slenderness
he
had
the
courage
to
wear
his
own
hair
which
was
of
a
dark
brown
and
very
luxuriant
dark
brown
too
were
his
sombre
eyes
and
set
at
a
downward
slant
from
those
odd
eyes
of
his
his
countenance
gathered
an
air
of
superciliousness
tempered
by
a
gentle
melancholy
for
the
rest
it
was
scored
by
lines
that
stamped
it
with
the
appearance
of
an
age
in
excess
of
his
thirty
years
thirty
guineas
worth
of
mechlin
at
his
throat
was
drenched
empurpled
and
ruined
beyond
redemption
and
on
the
breast
of
his
blue
satin
coat
a
dark
patch
was
spreading
like
a
stain
of
blood
richard
westmacott
short
sturdy
and
to
the
point
of
insipidity
watched
him
sullenly
out
of
pale
eyes
and
waited
it
was
lord
gervase
who
broke
at
last
the
silence
broke
it
with
an
oath
a
thing
unusual
in
one
whose
nature
was
almost
as
god
my
life
he
spluttered
wrathfully
glowering
at
richard
to
have
this
happen
in
my
house
the
young
fool
shall
make
apology
with
his
dying
breath
sneered
trenchard
and
the
old
rake
words
his
tone
and
the
malevolent
look
he
bent
upon
the
boy
increased
the
company
malaise
i
think
said
wilding
with
a
most
singular
and
excessive
sweetness
that
what
westmacott
has
done
he
has
done
because
he
apprehended
me
no
doubt
he
say
so
opined
trenchard
with
a
shrug
and
had
caution
dug
into
his
ribs
by
blake
elbow
whilst
richard
made
haste
to
prove
him
wrong
by
saying
the
contrary
i
apprehended
you
exactly
sir
he
answered
defiance
in
his
voice
and
face
ha
clucked
trenchard
irrepressible
he
bent
on
let
him
have
his
way
in
god
but
wilding
seemed
intent
upon
showing
how
he
could
be
he
gently
shook
his
head
nay
now
said
he
you
thought
westmacott
that
in
mentioning
your
sister
i
did
so
lightly
is
it
not
so
you
mentioned
her
and
that
is
all
that
matters
cried
westmacott
i
not
have
her
name
on
your
lips
at
any
time
or
in
any
place
no
nor
in
any
his
speech
was
thick
from
too
much
wine
you
are
drunk
cried
indignant
lord
gervase
with
finality
trenchard
elaborated
wilding
set
down
at
last
the
glass
which
he
had
continued
to
hold
until
that
moment
he
rested
his
hands
upon
the
table
knuckles
downward
and
leaning
forward
he
spoke
impressively
his
face
very
grave
and
those
present
knowing
him
as
they
did
were
one
and
all
lost
in
wonder
at
his
unusual
patience
mr
westmacott
said
he
i
do
think
you
are
wrong
to
persist
in
affronting
me
you
have
done
a
thing
that
is
beyond
forgiveness
and
yet
when
i
offer
you
this
opportunity
of
honourably
retrieving
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
leaving
the
sentence
incomplete
the
company
might
have
spared
its
deep
surprise
at
so
much
mildness
there
was
but
the
semblance
of
it
wilding
proceeded
thus
of
purpose
set
and
under
the
calm
mask
of
his
long
white
face
his
mind
worked
wickedly
and
deliberately
the
temerity
of
westmacott
whose
nature
was
notoriously
timid
had
surprised
him
for
a
moment
but
anon
reading
the
boy
mind
as
readily
as
though
it
had
been
a
scroll
unfolded
for
his
instruction
he
saw
that
westmacott
on
the
strength
of
his
position
as
his
sister
brother
conceived
himself
immune
wilding
avowed
courtship
of
the
lady
the
hopes
he
still
entertained
of
winning
her
despite
the
aversion
she
was
at
pains
to
show
him
gave
westmacott
assurance
that
wilding
would
never
elect
to
shatter
his
all
too
slender
chances
by
embroiling
himself
in
a
quarrel
with
her
brother
and
reading
him
thus
aright
wilding
put
on
that
mask
of
patience
luring
the
boy
into
greater
conviction
of
the
security
of
his
position
and
richard
conceiving
himself
safe
in
his
entrenchment
behind
the
bulwarks
of
his
brothership
to
ruth
westmacott
and
heartened
further
by
the
excess
of
wine
he
had
consumed
persisted
in
insults
he
would
never
otherwise
have
dared
to
offer
who
seeks
to
retrieve
he
crowed
offensively
boldly
looking
up
into
the
other
face
it
seems
you
are
yourself
and
he
laughed
a
trifle
stridently
and
looked
about
him
for
applause
but
found
none
you
are
overrash
lord
gervase
disapproved
him
harshly
not
the
first
coward
i
seen
grow
valiant
at
a
table
put
in
trenchard
by
way
of
explanation
and
might
have
come
to
words
with
blake
on
that
same
score
but
that
in
that
moment
wilding
spoke
again
reluctant
to
do
what
he
questioned
amiably
looking
westmacott
so
straightly
between
the
eyes
that
the
boy
shifted
uneasily
on
his
chair
nevertheless
still
full
of
confidence
in
the
unassailability
of
his
position
the
mad
youth
answered
to
cleanse
yourself
of
what
i
threw
at
fan
me
ye
winds
gasped
nick
trenchard
and
looked
with
expectancy
at
his
friend
wilding
now
there
was
one
factor
with
which
in
basing
with
such
craven
shrewdness
his
calculations
upon
wilding
feelings
for
his
sister
young
richard
had
not
reckoned
he
was
not
to
know
that
wilding
bruised
and
wounded
by
miss
westmacott
scorn
of
him
had
reached
that
borderland
where
love
and
hate
are
so
merged
that
they
are
scarce
to
be
distinguished
embittered
by
the
slights
she
had
put
upon
him
slights
which
his
sensitive
lover
fancy
had
magnified
a
hundredfold
anthony
wilding
frame
of
mind
was
grown
peculiar
of
his
love
she
would
have
none
his
kindness
she
seemingly
despised
so
be
it
she
should
taste
his
cruelty
if
she
scorned
his
wooing
and
forbade
him
to
pursue
it
at
least
it
was
not
hers
to
deny
him
the
power
to
hurt
and
in
hurting
her
that
would
not
be
loved
by
him
some
measure
of
fierce
and
bitter
consolation
seemed
to
await
him
he
realized
perhaps
not
quite
all
this
and
to
the
unworthiness
of
it
all
he
gave
no
thought
but
he
realized
enough
as
he
toyed
as
cat
with
mouse
with
richard
westmacott
to
know
that
in
striking
at
her
through
the
worthless
person
of
this
brother
whom
she
cherished
and
who
persisted
in
affording
him
this
opportunity
a
wicked
vengeance
would
be
his
lord
gervase
had
heaved
himself
suddenly
to
his
feet
at
westmacott
last
words
still
intent
upon
saving
the
situation
in
heaven
name
he
began
when
wilding
ever
calm
and
smiling
though
now
a
trifle
sinister
waved
him
gently
into
silence
but
that
persisting
calm
of
wilding
was
too
much
for
old
nick
trenchard
he
rose
abruptly
drawing
all
eyes
upon
himself
it
was
time
he
thought
he
took
a
hand
in
this
in
addition
to
his
affection
for
wilding
and
his
contempt
for
westmacott
he
was
filled
with
a
fear
that
the
latter
might
become
dangerous
if
not
crushed
at
once
gifted
with
a
shrewd
knowledge
of
men
acquired
during
a
chequered
life
of
much
sour
experience
old
nick
instinctively
mistrusted
richard
he
had
known
him
for
a
fool
a
weakling
a
babbler
and
a
bibber
of
wine
out
of
such
elements
a
villain
is
soon
compounded
and
trenchard
had
cause
to
fear
the
form
of
villainy
that
lay
ready
to
richard
hand
for
it
chanced
that
trenchard
was
second
cousin
to
that
famous
john
trenchard
so
lately
tried
for
treason
and
acquitted
to
the
great
joy
of
the
sectaries
of
the
west
and
still
more
lately
but
yesterday
in
fact
fled
the
country
to
escape
the
rearrest
ordered
in
consequence
of
that
excessive
joy
like
his
more
famous
cousin
nick
trenchard
was
one
of
the
duke
of
most
active
agents
and
westmacott
like
wilding
vallancey
and
one
or
two
others
at
that
board
stood
too
committed
to
the
cause
of
the
protestant
champion
out
of
his
knowledge
of
the
boy
trenchard
was
led
to
fear
that
if
he
were
leniently
dealt
with
now
tomorrow
when
sober
he
came
to
realize
the
grossness
of
the
thing
he
had
done
and
the
unlikelihood
of
its
being
forgiven
him
there
was
no
saying
but
that
to
protect
himself
he
might
betray
wilding
share
in
the
plot
that
was
being
hatched
that
in
itself
would
be
bad
enough
but
there
might
be
worse
for
he
could
scarcely
betray
wilding
without
betraying
others
and
what
mattered
most
the
cause
itself
he
must
be
dealt
with
out
of
hand
trenchard
opined
and
dealt
with
ruthlessly
i
think
anthony
said
he
that
we
have
had
words
enough
shall
you
be
disposing
of
westmacott
or
must
i
be
doing
it
for
you
with
a
gasp
of
dismay
young
richard
twisted
in
his
chair
to
confront
this
fresh
and
unsuspected
antagonist
what
danger
was
this
that
he
had
overlooked
then
even
as
he
turned
wilding
voice
fell
on
his
ear
and
each
word
of
the
few
he
spoke
was
like
a
drop
of
icy
water
on
westmacott
overheated
brain
i
protest
you
are
vastly
kind
nick
but
i
intend
myself
to
have
the
pleasure
of
killing
and
his
smile
fell
now
in
mockery
upon
the
disillusioned
lad
crushed
by
that
bolt
from
the
blue
richard
sat
as
if
stunned
the
flush
receding
from
his
face
until
his
very
lips
were
livid
the
shock
had
sobered
him
and
sobered
he
realized
in
terror
what
he
had
done
and
yet
even
sober
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
the
staff
upon
which
with
such
security
he
had
leaned
should
have
proved
rotten
true
he
had
put
much
strain
upon
it
but
then
he
had
counted
that
it
would
stand
much
strain
he
would
have
spoken
but
he
lacked
words
so
stricken
was
he
and
even
had
he
done
so
it
is
odds
none
would
have
heard
him
for
the
late
calm
was
of
a
sudden
turned
to
garboil
every
man
of
that
company
with
the
sole
exception
of
richard
himself
was
on
his
feet
and
all
were
speaking
at
once
in
clamouring
excited
chorus
wilding
alone
the
butt
of
their
expostulations
stood
quietly
smiling
and
wiped
his
face
at
last
with
a
kerchief
of
finest
lawn
dominating
the
others
in
the
babel
rose
the
voice
of
sir
rowland
blake
impecunious
blake
blake
lately
of
the
guards
who
had
sold
his
commission
as
the
only
thing
remaining
him
upon
which
he
could
raise
money
blake
that
other
suitor
for
miss
westmacott
hand
the
suitor
favoured
by
her
brother
you
shall
not
do
it
wilding
he
shouted
his
face
crimson
no
by
god
you
were
shamed
forever
he
is
but
a
lad
and
trenchard
eyed
the
short
powerfully
built
man
beside
him
and
laughed
unpleasantly
you
should
get
yourself
bled
one
of
these
days
sir
rowland
he
advised
there
may
be
no
great
danger
yet
but
a
man
be
too
careful
when
he
wears
a
narrow
blake
a
short
powerfully
built
man
took
no
heed
of
him
but
looked
straight
at
wilding
who
smiling
ever
calmly
returned
the
gaze
of
those
prominent
blue
eyes
you
will
suffer
me
sir
rowland
said
he
sweetly
to
be
the
judge
of
whom
i
will
and
whom
i
will
not
sir
rowland
flushed
under
that
mocking
glance
and
caustic
tone
but
he
is
drunk
he
repeated
feebly
i
think
said
trenchard
that
he
is
hearing
something
that
will
make
him
lord
gervase
took
the
lad
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
impatiently
well
quoth
he
have
you
nothing
to
say
you
did
a
deal
of
prating
just
now
i
make
no
doubt
but
that
even
at
this
late
hour
if
you
were
to
make
apology
it
would
be
idle
came
wilding
icy
voice
to
quench
the
gleam
of
hope
kindling
anew
in
richard
breast
the
lad
saw
that
he
was
lost
and
he
is
a
poor
thing
indeed
who
can
not
face
the
worst
once
that
worst
is
shown
to
be
irrevocable
he
rose
with
some
semblance
of
dignity
it
is
as
i
would
wish
said
he
but
his
livid
face
and
staring
eyes
belied
the
valour
of
his
words
he
cleared
his
huskiness
from
his
throat
sir
rowland
said
he
will
you
act
for
me
not
i
cried
blake
with
an
oath
i
be
no
party
to
the
butchery
of
a
boy
unfledged
echoed
trenchard
body
o
me
is
a
matter
wilding
will
amend
he
fledge
him
never
fear
he
wing
him
on
his
flight
to
of
set
purpose
did
trenchard
add
this
fuel
to
the
blazing
fire
it
was
no
part
of
his
views
that
this
encounter
should
be
avoided
if
richard
westmacott
were
allowed
to
live
after
what
had
passed
there
were
too
many
tall
fellows
might
go
in
peril
of
their
lives
richard
meanwhile
had
turned
to
the
man
on
his
left

vallancey
a
notorious
partisan
of
the
duke
of
monmouth

gentleman
who
was

worst
enemy

i
count
on
you
ned
he
asked
aye
to
the
death

vallancey
magniloquently

features

chapter
ii
sir
rowland
to
the
rescue
from
scoresby
hall
near
weston
zoyland
young
westmacott
rode
home
that
saturday
night
to
his
sister
house
in
bridgwater
a
sobered
man
and
an
anguished
he
had
committed
a
folly
which
was
like
to
cost
him
his
life
other
follies
had
he
committed
in
his
years
for
he
was
not
quite
the
babe
that
blake
had
represented
him
although
he
certainly
looked
nothing
like
his
age
but
he
had
contrived
to
set
the
crown
to
all
he
had
good
cause
to
blame
himself
and
to
curse
the
miscalculation
that
had
emboldened
him
to
launch
himself
upon
a
course
of
insult
against
this
wilding
whom
he
hated
with
all
the
currish
and
resentful
hatred
of
the
worthless
for
the
man
of
parts
but
there
was
more
than
hate
in
the
affront
that
he
had
offered
there
was
calculation
to
an
even
greater
extent
than
we
have
seen
it
happened
that
through
his
own
fault
young
richard
was
all
but
penniless
the
pious
nonconformist
soul
of
sir
geoffrey
lupton
the
wealthy
uncle
from
whom
he
had
had
great
expectations
had
been
so
stirred
to
anger
by
richard
vicious
and
besotted
ways
that
he
had
left
every
guinea
that
was
his
every
perch
of
land
and
every
brick
of
edifice
to
ruth
at
present
things
were
not
so
bad
for
the
worthless
boy
ruth
worshipped
him
he
was
a
sacred
charge
to
her
from
their
dead
father
who
knowing
the
stoutness
of
her
soul
and
the
feebleness
of
richard
had
in
dying
imposed
on
her
the
care
and
guidance
of
her
graceless
brother
but
ruth
in
all
things
strong
was
weak
with
richard
out
of
her
very
fondness
for
him
to
what
she
had
he
might
help
himself
and
thus
it
was
that
things
were
not
so
bad
with
him
at
present
but
when
richard
calculating
mind
came
to
give
thought
to
the
future
he
found
that
this
occasioned
him
some
care
rich
ladies
even
when
they
do
not
happen
to
be
equipped
in
addition
with
ruth
winsome
beauty
and
endearing
nature
are
not
wont
to
go
unmarried
it
would
have
pleased
richard
best
to
have
had
her
remain
a
spinster
but
he
well
knew
that
this
was
a
matter
in
which
she
might
have
a
voice
of
her
own
and
it
behoved
him
betimes
to
take
wise
measures
where
possible
husbands
were
concerned
the
first
that
came
in
a
suitor
obvious
panoply
was
anthony
wilding
of
zoyland
chase
and
richard
watched
his
advent
with
foreboding
wilding
was
a
personality
to
dazzle
any
woman
despite
perhaps
even
because
of
the
reputation
for
wildness
that
clung
to
him
that
he
was
known
as
wild
wilding
to
the
countryside
is
true
but
it
were
unfair
as
richard
knew
to
attach
to
this
too
much
importance
for
the
adoption
of
so
obvious
an
alliteration
the
rude
country
minds
needed
but
a
slight
encouragement
from
the
first
it
looked
as
if
ruth
might
favour
him
and
richard
fears
assumed
more
definite
shape
if
wilding
married
her
and
he
was
a
bold
masterful
fellow
who
usually
accomplished
what
he
aimed
at
her
fortune
and
estate
must
cease
to
be
a
pleasant
pasture
land
for
bovine
richard
the
boy
thought
at
first
of
making
terms
with
wilding
the
idea
was
old
it
had
come
to
him
when
first
he
had
counted
the
chances
of
his
sister
marrying
but
he
found
himself
hesitating
to
lay
his
proposal
before
wilding
and
whilst
he
hesitated
wilding
made
obvious
headway
still
richard
dared
not
do
it
there
was
a
something
in
wilding
eye
that
cried
him
danger
thus
in
the
end
since
he
could
not
attempt
a
compromise
with
this
fine
fellow
the
only
course
remaining
was
that
of
direct
antagonism
that
is
to
say
direct
as
richard
understood
directness
slander
was
the
weapon
he
used
in
that
secret
duel
the
countryside
was
well
stocked
with
stories
of
wilding
many
indiscretions
i
do
not
wish
to
suggest
that
these
were
unfounded
still
the
countryside
cajoled
by
its
primitive
sense
of
humour
into
that
alliteration
i
have
mentioned
found
that
having
given
this
dog
its
bad
name
it
was
under
the
obligation
of
keeping
up
his
reputation
so
it
exaggerated
richard
exaggerating
those
exaggerations
in
his
turn
had
some
details
as
interesting
and
unsavoury
as
they
were
in
the
main
untrue
to
lay
before
his
sister
now
established
love
it
is
well
known
thrives
wondrously
on
slander
the
robust
growth
of
a
maid
feelings
for
her
accepted
suitor
is
but
further
strengthened
by
malign
representations
of
his
character
she
seizes
with
joy
the
chance
of
affording
proof
of
her
great
loyalty
and
defies
the
world
and
its
evil
to
convince
her
that
the
man
to
whom
she
has
given
her
trust
is
not
most
worthy
of
it
not
so
however
with
the
first
timid
bud
of
incipient
interest
slander
nips
it
like
a
frost
in
deadliness
it
is
second
only
to
ridicule
ruth
westmacott
lent
an
ear
to
her
brother
stories
incredulous
only
until
she
remembered
vague
hints
she
had
caught
from
this
person
and
from
that
whose
meaning
was
now
made
clear
by
what
richard
told
her
which
incidentally
they
served
to
corroborate
corroboration
too
did
the
tale
of
infamy
receive
from
the
friendship
that
prevailed
between
wilding
and
nick
trenchard
the
old
who
in
his
time
as
everybody
knew
had
come
so
low
despite
his
gentle
birth
as
to
have
been
one
of
a
company
of
strolling
players
had
wilding
been
other
than
she
now
learnt
he
was
he
would
surely
not
cherish
an
attachment
for
a
person
so
utterly
unworthy
clearly
they
were
birds
of
a
plumage
and
so
her
maiden
purity
outraged
at
the
thought
that
she
had
been
in
danger
of
lending
a
willing
ear
to
the
wooing
of
such
a
man
she
had
crushed
this
love
which
she
blushed
to
think
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
out
roots
to
fasten
on
her
soul
and
was
sedulous
thereafter
in
manifesting
the
aversion
which
she
accounted
it
her
duty
to
foster
for
wilding
richard
had
watched
and
smiled
in
secret
taking
pride
in
the
cunning
way
he
had
wrought
this
change
that
cunning
which
so
often
is
given
to
the
stupid
by
way
of
compensation
for
the
intelligence
that
has
been
withheld
them
and
now
what
time
discountenanced
wilding
fumed
and
fretted
all
in
vain
sir
rowland
blake
fresh
from
london
and
in
full
flight
from
his
creditors
flashed
like
a
comet
into
the
bridgwater
heavens
he
dazzled
the
eyes
and
might
have
had
for
the
asking
the
heart
and
hand
of
diana
horton
ruth
cousin
her
heart
indeed
he
had
without
the
asking
for
diana
fell
straightway
in
love
with
him
and
showed
it
just
as
he
showed
that
he
was
not
without
response
to
her
affection
there
were
some
tender
passages
between
them
but
blake
for
all
his
fine
exterior
was
a
beggar
and
diana
far
from
rich
and
so
he
rode
his
feelings
with
a
hard
grip
upon
the
reins
and
then
in
an
evil
hour
for
poor
diana
young
westmacott
had
taken
him
to
lupton
house
and
sir
rowland
had
his
first
glimpse
of
ruth
his
first
knowledge
of
her
fortune
he
went
down
before
ruth
eyes
like
a
man
of
heart
he
went
down
more
lowly
still
before
her
possessions
like
a
man
of
greed
and
poor
diana
might
console
herself
with
whom
she
could
her
brother
watched
him
appraised
him
and
thought
that
in
this
broken
gamester
he
had
a
man
after
his
own
heart
a
man
who
would
be
ready
enough
for
such
a
bargain
as
richard
had
in
mind
ready
enough
to
sell
what
rags
might
be
left
him
of
his
honour
so
that
he
came
by
the
wherewithal
to
mend
his
broken
fortunes
the
twain
made
terms
they
haggled
like
any
pair
of
traders
out
of
jewry
but
in
the
end
it
was
settled
by
a
bond
duly
engrossed
and
sealed
that
on
the
day
that
sir
rowland
married
ruth
he
should
make
over
to
her
brother
certain
values
that
amounted
to
perhaps
a
quarter
of
her
possessions
there
was
no
cause
to
think
that
ruth
would
be
greatly
opposed
to
this
not
that
that
consideration
would
have
weighed
with
richard
but
now
that
all
essentials
were
so
satisfactorily
determined
a
vexation
was
offered
westmacott
by
the
circumstance
that
his
sister
seemed
nowise
taken
with
sir
rowland
she
suffered
him
because
he
was
her
friend
on
that
account
she
even
honoured
him
with
some
measure
of
her
own
friendship
but
to
no
greater
intimacy
did
her
manner
promise
to
admit
him
and
meanwhile
wilding
persisted
in
the
face
of
all
rebuffs
under
his
smiling
mask
he
hid
the
smart
of
the
wounds
she
dealt
him
until
it
almost
seemed
to
him
that
from
loving
her
he
had
come
to
hate
her
it
had
been
well
for
richard
had
he
left
things
as
they
were
and
waited
whether
blake
prospered
or
not
leastways
it
was
clear
that
wilding
would
not
prosper
and
that
for
the
season
was
all
that
need
have
mattered
to
young
richard
but
in
his
cups
that
night
he
had
thought
in
some
dim
way
to
precipitate
matters
by
affronting
wilding
secure
as
i
have
shown
in
his
belief
that
wilding
would
perish
sooner
than
raise
a
finger
against
ruth
brother
and
his
drunken
astuteness
it
seemed
had
been
to
his
mind
as
a
piece
of
bottle
glass
to
the
sight
distorting
the
image
viewed
through
it
with
some
such
bitter
reflection
rode
he
home
to
his
sleepless
couch
some
part
of
those
dark
hours
he
spent
in
bitter
reviling
of
wilding
of
himself
and
even
of
his
sister
whom
he
blamed
for
this
awful
situation
into
which
he
had
tumbled
at
other
times
he
wept
from
and
sheer
fright
once
indeed
he
imagined
that
he
saw
light
that
he
saw
a
way
out
of
the
peril
that
hemmed
him
in
his
mind
turned
for
a
moment
in
the
direction
that
trenchard
had
feared
it
might
he
bethought
him
of
his
association
with
the
monmouth
cause
into
which
he
had
been
beguiled
by
the
sordid
hope
of
gain
and
of
wilding
important
share
in
that
same
business
he
was
even
moved
to
rise
and
ride
that
very
night
for
exeter
to
betray
to
albemarle
the
cause
itself
so
that
he
might
have
wilding
laid
by
the
heels
but
if
trenchard
had
been
right
in
having
little
faith
in
richard
loyalty
he
had
it
seems
in
fearing
treachery
made
the
mistake
of
giving
richard
credit
for
more
courage
than
was
his
endowment
for
when
sitting
up
in
bed
fired
by
his
inspiration
young
westmacott
came
to
consider
the
questions
the
of
devon
would
be
likely
to
ask
him
he
reflected
that
the
answers
he
must
return
would
so
incriminate
himself
that
he
would
be
risking
his
own
neck
in
the
betrayal
he
flung
himself
down
again
with
a
curse
and
a
groan
and
thought
no
more
of
the
salvation
that
might
lie
for
him
that
way
the
morning
of
that
last
day
of
may
found
him
pale
and
limp
and
all
he
rose
betimes
and
dressed
but
stirred
not
from
his
chamber
till
in
the
garden
under
his
window
he
heard
his
sister
voice
and
that
of
diana
horton
joined
anon
by
a
man
deeper
tones
which
he
recognized
with
a
start
as
blake
what
did
the
baronet
here
so
early
assuredly
it
must
concern
the
impending
duel
richard
knew
no
mawkishness
on
the
score
of
eavesdropping
he
stole
to
his
window
and
lent
an
ear
but
the
voices
were
receding
and
to
his
vexation
he
caught
nothing
of
what
was
said
he
wondered
how
soon
vallancey
would
come
and
for
what
hour
the
encounter
had
been
appointed
vallancey
had
remained
behind
at
scoresby
hall
last
night
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
with
trenchard
who
was
to
act
for
wilding
now
it
chanced
that
trenchard
and
wilding
had
business
business
of
monmouth
to
transact
in
taunton
that
morning
business
which
might
not
be
delayed
there
were
odd
rumours
afloat
in
the
west
persistent
rumours
which
had
come
fast
upon
the
heels
of
the
news
of
landing
in
scotland
rumours
which
maintained
that
monmouth
himself
was
coming
over
from
holland
these
tales
wilding
and
his
associates
had
ignored
the
duke
they
knew
was
to
spend
the
summer
in
retreat
in
sweden
with
it
was
alleged
the
lady
henrietta
wentworth
to
bear
him
company
and
in
the
mean
time
his
trusted
agents
were
to
pave
the
way
for
his
coming
in
the
following
spring
of
late
the
lack
of
direct
news
from
the
duke
had
been
a
source
of
mystification
to
his
friends
in
the
west
and
now
suddenly
the
information
went
abroad
it
was
something
more
than
rumour
this
time
that
a
letter
of
the
greatest
importance
had
been
intercepted
from
whom
that
letter
proceeded
or
to
whom
it
was
addressed
could
not
yet
be
discovered
but
it
seemed
clear
that
it
was
connected
with
the
monmouth
cause
and
it
behoved
wilding
to
discover
what
he
could
with
this
intent
he
rode
with
trenchard
that
sunday
morning
to
taunton
hoping
that
at
the
red
lion
inn
that
of
dissenters
he
might
cull
reliable
information
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
that
the
meeting
with
richard
westmacott
was
not
to
take
place
until
the
evening
and
therefore
vallancey
came
not
to
lupton
house
as
early
as
richard
thought
he
should
expect
him
blake
however
more
no
doubt
out
of
a
selfish
fear
of
losing
a
valued
ally
in
the
winning
of
ruth
hand
than
out
of
any
excessive
concern
for
richard
himself
had
risen
early
and
hastened
to
lupton
house
in
the
hope
which
he
recognized
as
all
but
forlorn
of
yet
being
able
to
avert
the
disaster
he
foresaw
for
richard
peering
over
the
orchard
wall
as
he
rode
by
he
caught
a
glimpse
through
an
opening
between
the
trees
of
ruth
herself
and
diana
on
the
lawn
beyond
there
was
a
wicket
gate
that
stood
unlatched
and
availing
himself
of
this
sir
rowland
tethered
his
horse
in
the
lane
and
threading
his
way
briskly
through
the
orchard
came
suddenly
upon
the
girls
their
laughter
reached
him
as
he
advanced
and
told
him
they
could
know
nothing
yet
of
richard
danger
on
his
abrupt
and
unexpected
apparition
diana
paled
and
ruth
flushed
slightly
whereupon
sir
rowland
might
have
bethought
him
had
he
been
of
the
axiom
amour
qui
rougit
fleurette
amour
qui
plit
drame
du
he
doffed
his
hat
and
bowed
his
fair
ringlets
tumbling
forward
till
they
hid
his
face
which
was
exceeding
grave
ruth
gave
him
good
morning
pleasantly
you
london
folk
are
earlier
risers
than
we
are
led
to
think
she
added
be
the
change
of
air
makes
sir
rowland
matutinal
said
diana
making
a
gallant
recovery
from
her
agitation
i
vow
said
he
that
i
had
grown
matutinal
earlier
had
i
known
what
here
awaited
awaited
you
quoth
diana
and
tossed
her
head
archly
disdainful
la
sir
rowland
your
modesty
will
be
the
death
of
archness
became
this
lady
of
the
sunny
hair
nose
and
complexion
that
outvied
the
she
was
shorter
by
a
than
her
darker
cousin
and
made
up
in
sprightliness
what
she
lacked
of
gentle
dignity
the
pair
were
foils
each
setting
off
the
graces
of
the
other
i
protest
i
am
foolish
answered
blake
a
shade
discomfited
but
i
want
not
for
excuse
i
have
it
in
the
matter
that
brings
me
so
solemn
was
his
air
so
sober
his
voice
that
both
girls
felt
a
premonition
of
the
untoward
message
that
he
bore
it
was
ruth
who
asked
him
to
explain
himself
will
you
walk
ladies
said
blake
and
waved
the
hand
that
still
held
his
hat
riverwards
adown
the
sloping
lawn
they
moved
away
together
sir
rowland
pacing
between
his
love
of
yesterday
and
his
love
of
pressed
with
questions
from
both
he
shaded
his
eyes
to
look
at
the
river
dazzling
in
the
morning
sunlight
that
came
over
polden
hill
and
standing
thus
he
unburdened
himself
at
last
my
news
concerns
richard
and
they
looked
at
him
miss
westmacott
fine
level
brows
were
knit
he
paused
to
ask
as
if
suddenly
observing
his
absence
is
richard
not
yet
risen
not
yet
said
ruth
and
waited
for
him
to
proceed
it
does
credit
to
his
courage
that
he
should
sleep
late
on
such
a
day
said
blake
and
was
pleased
with
the
adroitness
wherewith
he
broke
the
news
he
quarrelled
last
night
with
anthony
ruth
hand
went
to
her
bosom

stared
at
blake
from
out
her
eyes
blue
as
the
heavens
overhead
a
grey
shade
overcast
the
usual
warm
pallor
of
her
face
with
wilding
she
cried
that
man
and
though
she
said
no
more
her
eyes
implored
him
to
go
on
and
tell
her
what
more
there
might
be
he
did
so
and
he
spared
not
wilding
the
task
indeed
was
one
to
which
he
applied
himself
with
a
certain
zest
whatever
might
be
the
outcome
of
the
affair
there
was
no
denying
that
he
was
by
way
of
reaping
profit
from
it
by
the
final
overthrow
of
an
acknowledged
rival
and
when
he
told
her
how
richard
had
flung
his
wine
in
wilding
face
when
wilding
stood
to
toast
her
a
faint
flush
crept
to
her
cheeks
richard
did
well
said
she
i
am
proud
of
the
words
pleased
sir
rowland
vastly
but
he
reckoned
without
diana
miss
horton
mind
was
illumined
by
her
knowledge
of
herself
in
the
light
of
that
she
saw
precisely
what
capital
this
sought
to
make
the
occasion
might
not
be
without
its
opportunities
for
her
and
to
begin
with
it
was
no
part
of
her
intention
that
wilding
should
be
thus
maligned
and
finally
driven
from
the
lists
of
rivalry
with
blake
upon
wilding
indeed
and
his
notorious
masterfulness
did
she
found
what
hopes
she
still
entertained
of
winning
back
sir
rowland
surely
said
she
you
are
a
little
hard
on
wilding
you
speak
as
if
he
were
the
first
gallant
that
ever
toasted
lady
i
am
no
lady
of
his
diana
ruth
reminded
her
with
a
faint
show
of
heat
diana
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
may
not
love
him
but
you
ordain
that
he
shall
not
love
you
you
are
very
harsh
i
think
to
me
it
rather
seems
that
richard
acted
like
a
but
mistress
cried
sir
rowland
half
out
of
countenance
and
stifling
his
vexation
in
these
matters
it
all
depends
upon
the
why
yes
she
agreed
and
whatever
wilding
manner
if
i
know
him
at
all
it
would
be
nothing
but
respectful
to
the
last
my
own
conception
of
respect
said
he
is
not
to
bandy
a
lady
name
about
a
company
of
bethink
you
though
you
said
just
now
it
all
depended
on
the
manner
she
rejoined
sir
rowland
shrugged
and
turned
half
from
her
to
her
listening
cousin
when
all
is
said
poor
diana
appears
despite
her
cunning
to
have
been
aiming
at
a
defined
advantage
in
the
game
she
played
she
either
ignored
or
held
too
lightly
the
concomitant
disadvantage
of
vexing
blake
it
were
perhaps
best
to
tell
us
the
exact
words
he
used
sir
rowland
she
suggested
that
for
ourselves
we
may
judge
how
far
he
lacked
what
signify
the
words
cried
blake
now
almost
out
of
temper
i
do
recall
them
it
is
the
air
with
which
he
pledged
mistress
ah
yes
the
manner
quoth
diana
irritatingly
we
let
that
be
richard
threw
his
wine
in
wilding
face
what
followed
then
what
said
wilding
sir
rowland
remembered
what
wilding
had
said
and
bethought
him
that
it
were
impolitic
in
him
to
repeat
it
at
the
same
time
not
having
looked
for
this
he
was
all
unprepared
with
any
likely
answer
he
hesitated
until
ruth
echoed
diana
question
tell
us
sir
rowland
she
begged
him
what
wilding
being
forced
to
say
something
and
being
by
nature
and
sluggish
of
invention
sir
rowland
was
compelled
to
his
unspeakable
chagrin
to
fall
back
upon
the
truth
is
not
that
proof
cried
diana
in
triumph
mr
wilding
was
reluctant
to
quarrel
with
richard
he
was
even
ready
to
swallow
such
an
affront
as
that
thinking
it
might
be
offered
him
under
a
misconception
of
his
meaning
he
plainly
professed
the
respect
that
filled
him
for
mistress
westmacott
and
yet
and
yet
sir
rowland
you
tell
us
that
he
lacked
respect
madam
cried
blake
turning
crimson
that
matters
nothing
it
was
not
the
place
or
time
to
introduce
your
cousin
name
you
think
sir
rowland
put
in
ruth
her
air
grave
judicial
almost
that
richard
behaved
well
as
i
would
like
to
behave
myself
as
i
would
have
a
son
of
mine
behave
on
the
like
occasion
blake
protested
but
we
waste
words
he
cried
i
did
not
come
to
defend
richard
nor
just
to
bear
you
this
untoward
news
i
came
to
consult
with
you
in
the
hope
that
we
might
find
some
way
to
avert
this
peril
from
your
what
way
is
possible
asked
ruth
and
sighed
i
would
not
i
would
not
have
richard
a
would
you
prefer
him
dead
asked
blake
sadly
grave
sooner
than
craven
yes
ruth
answered
him
very
white
there
is
no
question
of
that
was
blake
rejoinder
the
question
is
that
wilding
said
last
night
that
he
would
kill
the
boy
and
what
wilding
says
he
does
out
of
the
affection
that
i
bear
richard
is
born
my
anxiety
to
save
him
despite
himself
it
is
in
this
that
i
come
to
seek
your
aid
or
offer
mine
allied
we
might
accomplish
what
singly
neither
of
us
he
had
at
once
the
reward
of
his
cunning
speech
ruth
held
out
her
hands
you
are
a
good
friend
sir
rowland
she
said
with
a
pale
smile
and
pale
too
was
the
smile
with
which
diana
watched
them
no
more
than
ruth
did
she
suspect
the
sincerity
of
blake
protestations
i
am
proud
you
should
account
me
that
said
the
baronet
taking
hands
and
holding
them
a
moment
and
i
would
that
i
could
prove
myself
your
friend
in
this
to
some
good
purpose
believe
me
if
wilding
would
consent
that
i
might
take
your
brother
place
i
would
gladly
do
it
was
a
safe
boast
knowing
as
he
did
that
wilding
would
consent
to
no
such
thing
but
it
earned
him
a
glance
of
greater
kindliness
from
ruth
who
began
to
think
that
hitherto
perhaps
she
had
done
him
some
injustice
and
a
look
of
greater
admiration
from
diana
who
saw
in
him
her
of
the
gallant
lover
i
would
not
have
you
endanger
yourself
so
said
ruth
it
might
said
blake
his
blue
eyes
very
fierce
be
no
great
danger
after
and
then
dismissing
that
part
of
the
subject
as
if
like
a
brave
man
the
notion
of
being
thought
boastful
were
unpleasant
he
passed
on
to
the
discussion
of
ways
and
means
by
which
the
coming
duel
might
be
averted
but
when
they
came
to
grips
with
facts
it
seemed
that
sir
rowland
had
as
little
idea
of
what
might
be
done
as
had
the
ladies
true
he
began
by
making
the
obvious
suggestion
that
richard
should
tender
wilding
a
full
apology
that
indeed
was
the
only
door
of
escape
and
blake
shrewdly
suspected
that
what
the
boy
had
been
unwilling
to
do
last
night
partly
through
wine
and
partly
through
the
fear
of
looking
fearful
in
the
eyes
of
lord
gervase
guests
he
might
be
willing
enough
to
do
sober
and
upon
reflection
for
the
rest
blake
was
as
far
from
suspecting
peculiar
frame
of
mind
as
had
richard
been
last
night
this
his
words
showed
i
am
satisfied
said
he
that
if
richard
were
to
go
to
wilding
and
express
his
regret
for
a
thing
done
in
the
heat
of
wine
wilding
would
be
forced
to
accept
it
as
satisfaction
and
none
would
think
that
it
did
other
than
reflect
credit
upon
are
you
very
sure
of
that
asked
ruth
her
tone
dubious
her
glance
hopefully
anxious
what
else
is
to
be
thought
but
put
in
diana
shrewdly
it
were
an
admission
of
richard
that
he
had
done
no
less
he
agreed
and
ruth
caught
her
breath
in
fresh
dismay
and
yet
you
have
said
that
he
did
as
you
would
have
a
son
of
yours
do
diana
reminded
him
and
i
maintain
it
answered
blake
his
wits
worked
slowly
ever
it
was
for
ruth
to
reveal
the
flaw
to
him
do
you
not
understand
then
she
asked
him
sadly
that
such
an
admission
on
richard
part
would
amount
to
a
lie
a
lie
uttered
to
save
himself
from
an
encounter
the
worst
form
of
lie
a
lie
of
cowardice
surely
sir
rowland
your
kindly
anxiety
for
his
life
outruns
your
anxiety
for
his
diana
having
accomplished
her
task
hung
her
head
in
silence
pondering
sir
rowland
was
routed
utterly
he
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
companions
and
grew
afraid
that
he
the
town
gallant
might
come
to
look
foolish
in
the
eyes
of
these
country
ladies
he
protested
again
his
love
for
richard
and
increased
ruth
terror
by
his
mention
of
wilding
swordsmanship
but
when
all
was
said
he
saw
that
he
had
best
retreat
ere
he
spoiled
the
good
effect
which
he
hoped
his
solicitude
had
created
and
so
he
spoke
of
seeking
counsel
with
lord
gervase
scoresby
and
took
his
leave
promising
to
return
by
noon
chapter
iii
diana
schemes
notwithstanding
the
brave
face
ruth
westmacott
had
kept
during
his
presence
when
he
departed
sir
rowland
left
behind
him
a
distress
amounting
almost
to
anguish
in
her
mind
yet
though
she
might
suffer
there
was
no
weakness
in
ruth
nature
she
knew
how
to
endure
diana
bearing
richard
not
a
tenth
of
the
affection
his
sister
consecrated
to
him
was
alarmed
for
him
besides
her
own
interests
urged
the
averting
of
this
encounter
and
so
she
held
in
accents
almost
tearful
that
something
must
be
done
to
save
him
this
too
appeared
to
be
richard
own
view
when
presently
within
a
few
minutes
of
blake
departure
he
came
to
join
them
they
watched
his
approach
in
silence
and
both
noted
though
with
different
eyes
and
different
feelings
the
pallor
of
his
fair
face
the
dark
lines
under
his
colourless
eyes
his
condition
was
abject
and
his
manners
never
of
the
best
for
there
was
much
of
the
spoiled
child
about
richard
were
clearly
suffering
from
it
he
stood
before
his
sister
and
his
cousin
moving
his
eyes
shiftily
from
one
to
the
other
rubbing
his
hands
nervously
together
your
precious
friend
sir
rowland
has
been
here
said
he
and
it
was
not
clear
from
his
manner
which
of
them
he
addressed
not
a
doubt
but
he
will
have
brought
you
the
he
seemed
to
sneer
ruth
advanced
towards
him
her
face
grave
her
sweet
eyes
full
of
pitying
concern
she
placed
a
hand
upon
his
sleeve
my
poor
richard
she
began
but
he
shook
off
her
kindly
touch
laughing
angrily
a
mere
cackle
of
irritability
odso
he
interrupted
her
it
is
a
thought
late
for
this
mock
kindliness
diana
in
the
background
arched
her
brows
then
with
a
shrug
turned
aside
and
seated
herself
on
the
stone
seat
by
which
they
had
been
standing
ruth
shrank
back
as
if
her
brother
had
struck
her
richard
she
cried
and
searched
his
livid
face
with
her
eyes
richard
he
read
a
question
in
the
interjection
and
he
answered
it
had
you
known
any
real
care
any
true
concern
for
me
you
had
not
given
cause
for
this
affair
he
chid
her
peevishly
what
are
you
saying
she
cried
and
it
occurred
to
her
at
last
that
richard
was
afraid
he
was
a
coward
she
felt
as
she
would
faint
i
am
saying
said
he
hunching
his
shoulders
and
shivering
as
he
spoke
yet
his
glance
unable
to
meet
hers
that
it
is
your
fault
that
i
am
like
to
get
my
throat
cut
before
my
fault
she
murmured
the
slope
of
lawn
seemed
to
wave
and
swim
about
her
my
fault
the
fault
of
your
wanton
ways
he
accused
her
harshly
you
have
so
played
fast
and
loose
with
this
fellow
wilding
that
he
makes
free
of
your
name
in
my
very
presence
and
puts
upon
me
the
need
to
get
myself
killed
by
him
to
save
the
family
he
would
have
said
more
in
this
strain
but
something
in
her
glance
gave
him
pause
there
fell
a
silence
from
the
distance
came
the
melodious
pealing
of
church
bells
high
overhead
a
lark
was
pouring
out
its
song
in
the
lane
at
the
orchard
end
rang
the
beat
of
trotting
hoofs
it
was
diana
who
spoke
presently
just
indignation
stirred
her
and
when
stirred
she
knew
no
pity
set
no
limits
to
her
speech
i
think
indeed
said
she
her
voice
crisp
and
merciless
that
the
family
honour
will
best
be
saved
if
wilding
kills
you
it
is
in
danger
while
you
live
you
are
a
coward
diana
he
thundered
he
could
be
mighty
brave
with
women
whilst
ruth
clutched
her
arm
to
restrain
her
but
she
continued
undeterred
you
are
a
coward
a
pitiful
coward
she
told
him
consult
your
mirror
it
will
tell
you
what
a
palsied
thing
you
are
that
you
should
dare
so
speak
to
ruth
do
ruth
begged
her
turning
aye
growled
richard
she
had
best
be
diana
rose
to
battle
her
cheeks
crimson
it
asks
a
braver
man
than
you
to
compel
my
obedience
she
told
him
la
she
fumed
i
swear
that
had
wilding
overheard
what
you
have
said
to
your
sister
you
would
have
little
to
fear
from
his
sword
a
cane
would
be
the
weapon
he
use
on
richard
pale
eyes
flamed
malevolently
a
violent
rage
possessed
him
and
flooded
out
his
fear
for
nothing
can
so
goad
a
man
as
an
offensive
truth
ruth
approached
him
again
again
she
took
him
by
the
arm
seeking
to
soothe
his
spirit
but
again
he
shook
her
off
and
then
to
save
the
situation
came
a
servant
from
the
house
so
lost
in
anger
was
all
richard
sense
of
decency
that
the
mere
supervention
of
the
man
would
not
have
been
enough
to
have
silenced
him
could
he
have
found
adequate
words
in
which
to
answer
mistress
horton
but
even
as
he
racked
his
mind
the
footman
voice
broke
the
silence
and
the
words
the
fellow
uttered
did
what
his
presence
alone
might
not
have
sufficed
to
do
mr
vallancey
is
asking
for
you
sir
he
announced
richard
started
vallancey
he
had
come
at
last
and
his
coming
was
connected
with
the
impending
duel
the
thought
was
paralyzing
to
young
westmacott
the
flush
of
anger
faded
from
his
face
its
leaden
hue
returned
and
he
shivered
as
with
cold
at
last
he
mastered
himself
sufficiently
to
ask
where
is
he
jasper
in
the
library
sir
replied
the
servant
shall
i
bring
him
hither
yes
no
he
answered
i
will
come
to
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
ladies
paused
a
moment
still
irresolute
then
as
by
an
effort
he
followed
the
servant
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
through
the
ivied
porch
as
he
went
diana
flew
to
her
cousin
her
shallow
nature
was
touched
with
transient
pity
my
poor
ruth
she
murmured
soothingly
and
set
her
arm
about
the
other
waist
there
was
a
gleam
of
tears
in
the
eyes
ruth
turned
upon
her
together
they
came
to
the
granite
seat
and
sank
to
it
side
by
side
fronting
the
placid
river
there
ruth
her
elbows
on
her
knees
cradled
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
with
a
sigh
of
misery
stared
straight
before
her
it
was
untrue
she
said
at
last
what
richard
said
of
me
was
why
yes
diana
snapped
contemptuous
the
only
truth
is
that
richard
is
ruth
shivered
ah
no
she
pleaded
she
knew
how
true
was
the
impeachment
do
say
it
it
matters
little
that
i
say
it
snorted
diana
impatiently
it
is
a
truth
proclaimed
by
the
first
glance
at
he
is
in
poor
health
perhaps
said
ruth
seeking
miserably
to
excuse
him
aye
said
diana
he
suffering
from
an
ague
the
result
of
a
lack
of
courage
that
he
should
so
have
spoken
to
you
give
me
patience
heaven
ruth
crimsoned
again
at
the
memory
of
his
words
a
wave
of
indignation
swept
through
her
gentle
soul
but
was
gone
at
once
leaving
an
ineffable
sadness
in
its
room
what
was
to
be
done
she
turned
to
diana
for
counsel
but
diana
was
still
whipping
up
her
scorn
if
he
goes
out
to
meet
wilding
he
shame
himself
and
every
man
and
woman
that
bears
the
name
of
westmacott
said
she
and
struck
a
new
fear
with
that
into
the
heart
of
ruth
he
must
not
go
she
answered
passionately
he
must
not
meet
him
diana
flashed
her
a
sidelong
glance
and
if
he
does
will
things
be
mended
she
inquired
will
it
save
his
honour
to
have
wilding
come
and
cane
him
he
not
do
that
said
ruth
not
if
you
asked
him
no
was
diana
sharp
retort
and
she
caught
her
breath
on
the
last
word
of
it
for
just
then
the
devil
dropped
the
seed
of
a
suggestion
into
the
fertile
soil
of
her
lovesick
soul
diana
ruth
exclaimed
in
reproof
turning
to
confront
her
cousin
but
diana
mind
started
upon
its
scheming
journey
was
now
travelling
fast
out
of
that
devil
seed
there
sprang
with
amazing
rapidity
a
growth
throwing
out
branches
putting
forth
leaves
bearing
already
in
her
fancy
bloom
and
fruit
why
not
quoth
she
after
a
breathing
space
and
her
voice
was
gentle
her
tone
innocent
beyond
compare
why
should
you
not
ask
him
ruth
frowned
perplexed
and
thoughtful
and
now
diana
turned
to
her
with
the
lively
eye
of
one
into
whose
mind
has
leapt
a
sudden
inspiration
ruth
she
exclaimed
why
indeed
should
you
not
ask
him
to
forgo
this
duel
how
how
could
i
faltered
ruth
he
not
deny
you
you
know
he
i
do
not
know
it
answered
ruth
but
if
i
did
how
could
i
ask
it
were
i
richard
sister
and
had
i
his
life
and
honour
at
heart
as
you
have
i
not
ask
how
if
richard
goes
to
that
encounter
he
loses
both
remember
unless
between
this
and
then
he
undergoes
some
change
were
i
in
your
place
i
straight
to
to
him
mused
ruth
sitting
up
how
could
i
go
to
him
go
to
him
yes
diana
insisted
go
to
him
at
once
while
there
is
yet
ruth
rose
and
moved
away
a
step
or
two
towards
the
water
deep
in
thought
diana
watched
her
furtively
and
slyly
the
rapid
rise
and
fall
of
her
maiden
breast
betraying
the
agitation
that
filled
her
as
she
waited
like
a
gamester
for
the
turn
of
the
card
that
would
show
her
whether
she
had
won
or
lost
for
she
saw
clearly
how
ruth
might
be
so
compromised
that
there
was
something
more
than
a
chance
that
diana
would
no
longer
have
cause
to
account
her
cousin
a
barrier
between
herself
and
blake
i
could
not
go
alone
said
ruth
and
her
tone
was
that
of
one
still
battling
with
a
notion
that
is
repugnant
why
if
that
is
all
said
diana
then
i
go
with
i
ca
i
ca
consider
the
consider
richard
rather
the
fair
temptress
made
answer
eagerly
be
sure
that
wilding
will
save
you
all
humiliation
he
not
deny
you
at
a
word
from
you
i
know
what
answer
he
will
make
he
will
refuse
to
push
the
matter
forward
acknowledge
himself
in
the
wrong
do
whatever
you
may
ask
him
he
can
do
it
none
will
question
his
courage
it
has
been
proved
too
she
rose
and
came
to
ruth
she
set
her
arm
about
her
waist
again
and
poured
shrewd
persuasion
over
her
indecision
you
thank
me
for
this
thought
she
assured
her
why
do
you
pause
are
you
so
selfish
as
to
think
more
of
the
little
humiliation
that
may
await
you
than
of
richard
life
and
honour
no
no
ruth
protested
feebly
what
then
is
richard
to
go
out
and
slay
his
honour
by
a
show
of
fear
before
he
is
slain
himself
by
the
man
he
has
insulted
i
go
said
ruth
now
that
the
resolve
was
taken
she
was
brisk
impatient
come
diana
let
jerry
saddle
for
us
we
ride
to
zoyland
chase
at
they
went
without
a
word
to
richard
who
was
still
closeted
with
vallancey
and
riding
forth
they
crossed
the
river
and
took
the
road
that
skirting
sedgemoor
runs
south
to
weston
zoyland
they
rode
with
little
said
until
they
came
to
the
point
where
the
road
branches
on
the
left
throwing
out
an
arm
across
the
moor
towards
chedzoy
a
mile
or
so
short
of
zoyland
chase
here
diana
reined
in
with
a
sharp
gasp
of
pain
ruth
checked
and
cried
to
know
what
ailed
her
it
is
the
sun
i
think
muttered
diana
her
hand
to
her
brow
i
am
sick
and
and
she
slipped
a
thought
heavily
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
ruth
had
dismounted
and
was
beside
her
diana
was
pale
which
lent
colour
to
her
complaint
for
ruth
was
not
to
know
that
the
pallor
sprang
from
her
agitation
in
wondering
whether
the
ruse
she
attempted
would
succeed
or
not
a
short
from
where
they
had
halted
stood
a
cottage
back
from
the
road
in
a
little
plot
of
ground
the
property
of
a
kindly
old
woman
known
to
both
there
diana
expressed
the
wish
to
rest
awhile
and
thither
they
took
their
way
ruth
leading
both
horses
and
supporting
her
faltering
cousin
the
dame
was
all
solicitude
diana
was
led
into
her
parlour
and
what
could
be
done
was
done
her
corsage
was
loosened
water
drawn
from
the
well
and
brought
her
to
drink
and
bathe
her
brow
she
sat
back
languidly
her
head
lolling
sideways
against
one
of
the
wings
of
the
great
chair
and
languidly
assured
them
she
would
be
better
soon
if
she
were
but
allowed
to
rest
awhile
ruth
drew
up
a
stool
to
sit
beside
her
for
all
that
her
soul
fretted
at
this
delay
what
if
in
consequence
she
should
reach
zoyland
chase
too
late
to
find
that
wilding
had
gone
forth
already
but
even
as
she
was
about
to
sit
it
seemed
that
the
same
thought
had
of
a
sudden
come
to
diana
the
girl
leaned
forward
thrusting
as
if
by
an
effort
some
of
her
faintness
from
her
do
not
wait
for
me
ruth
she
begged
i
must
you
must
not
the
other
insisted
think
what
it
may
mean
life
perhaps
no
no
ruth
dear
go
on
go
on
to
zoyland
i
follow
you
in
a
few
i
wait
for
you
said
ruth
with
firmness
at
that
diana
rose
and
in
rising
staggered
then
we
push
on
at
once
she
gasped
as
if
speech
itself
were
an
excruciating
effort
but
you
are
in
no
case
to
stand
said
ruth
sit
diana
either
you
go
on
alone
or
i
go
with
you
but
go
at
once
you
must
at
any
moment
wilding
may
go
forth
and
your
chance
is
lost
i
not
have
richard
blood
upon
my
ruth
wrung
her
hands
in
her
dismay
confronted
by
a
parlous
choice
consent
to
diana
accompanying
her
in
this
condition
she
could
not
ride
on
alone
to
wilding
house
was
hardly
to
be
thought
of
and
yet
if
she
delayed
she
was
endangering
richard
life
by
the
very
strength
of
her
nature
she
was
caught
in
the
mesh
of
diana
scheme
she
saw
that
her
hesitation
was
unworthy
this
was
no
ordinary
cause
no
ordinary
occasion
it
was
a
time
for
heroic
measures
she
must
ride
on
nor
could
she
consent
to
take
diana
and
so
in
the
end
she
went
having
seen
her
cousin
settled
again
in
the
high
chair
and
took
with
her
diana
feeble
assurances
that
she
would
follow
her
in
a
few
moments
as
soon
as
her
faintness
passed

iv

mr
wilding
rode
at
dawn
with
trenchard
madam
announced
old
walters
the
butler
at
zoyland
chase
old
and
familiar
servant
though
he
was
he
kept
from
his
countenance
all
manifestation
of
the
deep
surprise
occasioned
him
by
the
advent
of
mistress
westmacott
unescorted
he
rode
at
dawn
faltered
ruth
and
for
a
moment
she
stood
irresolute
afraid
and
pondering
in
the
shade
of
the
great
pillared
porch
then
she
took
heart
again
if
he
rode
at
dawn
it
was
not
in
quest
of
richard
that
he
went
since
it
had
been
near
eleven
when
she
had
left
bridgwater
he
must
have
gone
on
other
business
first
and
doubtless
before
he
went
to
the
encounter
he
would
be
returning
home
said
he
at
what
hour
he
would
return
she
asked
he
bade
us
expect
him
by
noon
this
gave
confirmation
to
her
thoughts
it
wanted
more
than
half
an
hour
to
noon
already
then
he
may
return
at
any
moment
said
she
at
any
moment
madam
was
the
grave
reply
she
took
her
resolve
i
will
wait
she
announced
to
the
increasing
if
undisplayed
astonishment
let
my
horse
be
seen
he
bowed
his
obedience
and
she
followed
him
a
slender
graceful
figure
in
her
laced
with
silver
across
the
vestibule
through
the
cool
gloom
of
the
great
hall
into
the
spacious
library
of
which
he
held
the
door
mistress
horton
is
following
me
she
informed
the
butler
will
you
bring
her
to
me
when
she
comes
bowing
again
in
silent
acquiescence
the
servant
closed
the
door
and
left
her
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
great
room
drawing
off
her
perturbed
and
frightened
beyond
all
reason
at
finding
herself
for
the
first
time
under
wilding
roof
he
was
most
handsomely
housed
his
grandfather
who
had
travelled
in
italy
had
built
the
chase
upon
the
severe
and
noble
lines
which
there
he
had
learnt
to
admire
and
he
had
embellished
its
interior
too
with
many
treasures
of
art
which
with
that
intent
he
had
there
collected
she
dropped
her
whip
and
gloves
on
to
a
table
and
sank
into
a
chair
to
wait
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
throat
time
passed
and
in
the
silence
of
the
great
house
her
anxiety
was
gradually
quieted
until
at
last
through
the
long
window
that
stood
open
came
faintly
wafted
to
her
on
the
soft
breeze
of
that
june
morning
the
sound
of
a
church
clock
at
weston
zoyland
chiming
twelve
she
rose
with
a
start
bethinking
her
suddenly
of
diana
and
wondering
why
she
had
not
yet
arrived
was
the
child
indisposition
graver
than
she
had
led
ruth
to
suppose
she
crossed
to
the
windows
and
stood
there
drumming
impatiently
upon
the
pane
her
eyes
straying
idly
over
the
sweep
of
lawns
towards
the
river
gleaming
silvery
here
and
there
between
the
trees
in
the
distance
suddenly
she
caught
a
sound
of
hoofs
was
this
diana
she
sped
to
the
other
window
the
one
that
stood
open
and
now
she
heard
the
crunch
of
gravel
and
the
champ
of
bits
and
the
sound
of
more
than
two
pairs
of
hoofs
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
wilding
and
trenchard
she
felt
the
colour
flying
from
her
cheeks
again
her
heart
fluttered
in
her
throat
and
it
was
in
vain
that
with
her
hand
she
sought
to
repress
the
heaving
of
her
breast
she
was
afraid
her
every
instinct
bade
her
slip
through
the
window
at
which
she
stood
and
run
from
zoyland
chase
and
then
she
thought
of
richard
and
his
danger
and
she
seemed
to
gather
courage
from
the
reflection
of
her
purpose
in
this
house
men
voices
reached
her
a
laugh
the
harsh
cawing
of
nick
trenchard
a
lady
she
heard
him
cry
heart
tony
is
this
a
time
for
trafficking
with
doxies
she
crimsoned
an
instant
at
the
coarse
word
and
set
her
teeth
only
to
pale
again
the
next
the
voices
were
lowered
so
that
she
heard
not
what
was
said
one
sharp
exclamation
she
recognized
to
be
in
wilding
voice
but
caught
not
the
word
he
uttered
there
followed
a
pause
and
she
stirred
uneasily
waiting
then
came
swift
steps
and
jangling
spurs
across
the
hall
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
wilding
in
a
scarlet
his
boots
white
with
dust
stood
bowing
to
her
from
the
threshold
your
servant
mistress
westmacott
she
heard
him
murmur
my
house
is
deeply
she
dropped
him
a
pale
and
he
turned
to
deliver
hat
and
whip
and
gloves
to
walters
who
had
followed
him
then
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
into
the
room
you
will
forgive
that
i
present
myself
thus
before
you
he
said
in
apology
for
his
dusty
raiment
but
i
bethought
me
you
might
be
in
haste
and
walters
tells
me
that
already
have
you
waited
nigh
upon
an
hour
will
you
not
sit
madam
and
he
advanced
a
chair
his
long
white
face
was
set
like
a
mask
but
his
dark
slanting
eyes
devoured
her
he
guessed
the
reason
of
her
visit
she
who
had
humbled
him
who
had
driven
him
to
the
very
borders
of
despair
was
now
to
be
humbled
and
to
despair
before
him
under
the
impassive
face
his
soul
exulted
fiercely
she
disregarded
the
chair
he
proffered
my
visit
has
no
doubt
surprised
you
she
began
tremulous
and
hesitating
i
faith
no
he
answered
quietly
the
cause
after
all
is
not
very
far
to
seek
you
are
come
on
richard
not
on
richard
she
answered
on
my
and
now
that
the
ice
was
broken
the
suspense
of
waiting
over
she
found
the
tide
of
her
courage
flowing
fast
this
encounter
must
not
take
place
wilding
she
informed
him
he
raised
his
eyebrows
fine
and
level
as
her
own
his
thin
lips
smiled
never
so
faintly
it
is
i
think
said
he
for
richard
to
prevent
it
the
chance
was
his
last
night
it
shall
be
his
again
when
we
meet
if
he
will
express
regret
he
left
his
sentence
there
in
truth
he
mocked
her
though
she
guessed
it
not
you
mean
said
she
that
if
he
makes
apology
what
else
what
other
way
remains
she
shook
her
head
and
if
pale
her
face
was
resolute
her
glance
steady
that
is
impossible
she
told
him
last
night
as
i
have
the
story
he
might
have
done
it
without
shame
it
is
too
late
to
tender
his
apology
on
the
ground
would
be
to
proclaim
himself
a
wilding
pursed
his
lips
and
shifted
his
position
it
is
difficult
perhaps
said
he
but
not
it
is
impossible
she
insisted
firmly
i
not
quarrel
with
you
for
a
word
he
answered
mighty
agreeable
call
it
impossible
if
you
will
admit
however
that
it
is
all
i
can
suggest
you
will
do
me
the
justice
i
am
sure
to
see
that
in
expressing
my
willingness
to
accept
your
brother
expressions
of
regret
i
am
proving
myself
once
more
your
very
obedient
servant
but
that
it
is
you
who
ask
it
and
whose
desires
are
my
commands
i
should
let
no
man
go
unpunished
for
an
insult
such
as
your
brother
put
upon
she
winced
at
his
words
at
the
bow
with
which
he
had
professed
himself
once
more
her
servant
it
is
no
clemency
that
you
offer
him
she
said
you
leave
him
a
choice
between
death
and
he
has
wilding
reminded
her
the
chance
of
she
flung
back
her
head
impatiently
i
think
you
mock
me
said
she
he
looked
at
her
keenly
will
you
tell
me
plainly
madam
he
begged
what
you
would
have
me
do
she
flushed
under
his
gaze
and
the
flush
told
him
what
he
sought
to
learn
there
was
of
course
another
way
and
she
had
thought
of
it
but
she
lacked
as
well
she
might
all
things
considered
the
courage
to
propose
it
she
had
come
to
wilding
in
the
vague
hope
that
he
himself
would
choose
the
heroic
part
and
he
to
punish
for
her
scorn
of
him
this
woman
whom
he
loved
to
was
resolved
that
she
herself
must
beg
it
of
him
whether
having
so
far
compelled
her
he
would
grant
her
prayer
or
not
was
something
he
could
not
just
then
himself
have
told
you
she
bowed
her
head
in
silence
and
wilding
that
faint
smile
half
friendliness
half
mockery
hovering
ever
on
his
lips
turned
aside
and
moved
softly
towards
the
window
her
eyes
veiled
behind
the
long
lashes
of
their
drooping
lids
followed
him
furtively
she
felt
that
she
hated
him
in
very
truth
she
marked
the
upright
elegance
of
his
figure
the
easy
grace
of
his
movements
the
fine
aristocratic
mould
of
the
aquiline
face
which
she
beheld
in
profile
and
she
hated
him
the
more
for
these
outward
favours
that
must
commend
him
to
no
lack
of
women
he
was
too
masterful
he
made
her
realize
too
keenly
her
own
weakness
and
that
of
richard
she
felt
that
just
now
he
controlled
the
vice
that
held
her
fast
her
affection
for
her
brother
and
because
of
that
she
hated
him
the
more
you
see
mistress
westmacott
said
he
his
shoulder
to
her
his
tone
sweet
to
the
point
of
sadness
that
there
is
nothing
she
stood
her
eyes
following
the
pattern
of
the
parquetry
her
foot
unconsciously
tracing
it
her
courage
ebbed
and
she
had
no
answer
for
him
after
a
pause
he
spoke
again
still
without
turning
if
that
was
not
enough
to
suit
your
ends
and
though
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
sadness
there
glinted
through
it
the
faintest
ray
of
mockery
i
marvel
you
should
have
come
to
zoyland
to
compromise
yourself
to
so
little
she
raised
a
startled
face
com
compromise
myself
she
echoed
oh
it
was
a
cry
of
indignation
what
else
quoth
he
and
turned
abruptly
to
confront
her
mistress
horton
was
was
with
me
she
panted
her
voice
quivering
as
on
the
brink
of
tears
is
unfortunate
you
should
have
separated
he
condoled
but
but
wilding
i
i
trusted
to
your
honour
i
accounted
you
a
gentleman
surely
surely
sir
you
will
not
let
it
be
known
that
i
came
to
you
you
will
keep
my
secret
secret
said
he
his
eyebrows
raised
is
already
the
talk
of
the
servants
hall
by
be
the
gossip
of
air
failed
her
her
blue
eyes
fixed
him
in
horror
out
of
her
stricken
face
not
a
word
had
she
wherewith
to
answer
him
the
sight
of
her
thus
affected
him
oddly
his
passion
for
her
surged
up
aroused
by
pity
for
her
plight
and
awakened
in
him
a
sense
of
his
brutality
a
faint
flush
stirred
in
his
cheeks
he
stepped
quickly
to
her
and
caught
her
hand
she
let
it
lie
cold
and
inert
within
his
nervous
grasp
ruth
ruth
he
cried
and
his
voice
was
for
once
unsteady
give
it
no
thought
i
love
you
ruth
if
you
but
heed
that
no
breath
of
scandal
can
hurt
she
swallowed
hard
as
how
she
asked
mechanically
he
bowed
low
over
her
hand
so
low
that
his
face
was
hidden
from
her
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
become
my
wife
he
began
but
got
no
further
for
she
snatched
away
her
hand
her
cheeks
crimsoning
her
eyes
aflame
with
indignation
he
stepped
back
crimsoning
too
she
had
dashed
the
gentleness
from
his
mood
he
was
angered
now
and
tigerish
oh
she
panted
it
is
to
affront
me
is
this
the
time
or
place
he
cropped
her
flow
of
indignant
speech
ere
it
was
well
begun
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
tight
and
so
sudden
was
the
act
so
firm
his
grip
that
she
had
not
the
thought
or
force
to
struggle
all
time
is
love
time
all
places
are
love
place
he
told
her
his
face
close
to
her
own
and
of
all
time
and
places
the
present
ever
preferable
to
the
wise
for
life
is
uncertain
and
short
at
best
i
bring
you
worship
and
you
answer
me
with
scorn
but
i
shall
prevail
and
you
shall
come
to
love
me
in
very
spite
of
your
own
she
threw
back
her
head
away
from
his
as
far
as
the
bonds
he
had
cast
about
her
would
allow
air
air
she
panted
feebly
oh
you
shall
have
air
enough
anon
he
answered
with
a
laugh
his
passion
mounting
ever
hark
you
now
hark
you
for
richard
sake
since
you
not
listen
for
my
own
nor
yours
there
is
another
course
by
which
i
can
save
both
richard
life
and
honour
you
know
it
and
you
counted
upon
my
generosity
to
suggest
it
but
you
overlooked
the
thing
on
which
you
should
have
counted
you
overlooked
my
love
count
upon
that
my
ruth
and
richard
shall
have
naught
to
fear
count
upon
that
and
when
we
meet
this
evening
richard
and
i
it
is
i
who
will
tender
the
apology
i
who
will
admit
that
i
was
wrong
to
introduce
your
name
into
that
company
last
night
and
that
what
richard
did
was
a
just
and
punishment
upon
me
this
will
i
do
if
you
but
count
upon
my
she
looked
up
at
him
fearfully
yet
with
flutterings
of
hope
what
you
mean
she
asked
him
faintly
that
if
you
promise
to
be
my
wife
your
wife
she
interrupted
him
she
struggled
to
free
herself
released
one
arm
and
struck
him
in
the
face
let
me
go
you
coward
he
was
answered
his
arms
melted
from
her
he
fell
back
a
pace
very
white
and
even
trembling
the
fire
all
gone
from
his
eye
which
was
now
turned
dull
and
deadly
so
be
it
he
said
and
strode
to
the
i
not
offend
again
i
had
not
offended
now
he
continued
in
the
voice
of
one
offering
an
explanation
cold
and
formal
but
that
when
first
i
came
into
your
life
you
seemed
to
bid
me
his
fingers
closed
upon
the
crimson
she
guessed
his
purpose
wait
she
gasped
and
put
forth
her
hand
he
paused
the
rope
in
his
his
eye
kindling
anew
you
you
mean
to
kill
richard
now
she
asked
him
a
swift
lifting
of
his
brows
was
his
only
answer
he
tugged
the
cord
from
the
distance
the
peal
of
the
bell
reached
them
faintly
oh
wait
wait
she
begged
her
hands
pressed
against
her
cheeks
he
stood
impassible
hatefully
impassible
if
i
were
to
consent
to
this
how
how
soon
he
understood
the
unfinished
question
interest
warmed
his
face
again
he
took
a
step
towards
her
but
by
a
gesture
she
seemed
to
beg
him
come
no
nearer
if
you
will
promise
to
marry
me
within
the
week
richard
shall
have
no
cause
to
fear
either
for
his
life
or
his
honour
at
my
she
seemed
now
to
be
recovering
her
calm
very
well
she
said
her
voice
singularly
steady
let
that
be
a
bargain
between
us
spare
richard
life
and
honour
both
remember
and
on
sunday
next
for
all
her
courage
her
voice
quavered
and
faltered
she
dared
add
no
more
lest
it
should
break
altogether
wilding
drew
a
deep
breath
again
he
would
have
advanced
ruth
he
cried
and
some
repentance
smote
him
some
shame
shook
him
in
his
purpose
at
that
moment
it
was
in
his
mind
to
capitulate
unconditionally
to
tell
her
that
richard
should
have
naught
to
fear
from
him
and
yet
that
she
should
go
free
as
the
winds
her
gesture
checked
him
it
was
so
eloquent
of
aversion
he
paused
in
his
advance
stifled
his
better
feelings
and
turned
once
more
relentless
the
door
opened
and
old
walters
stood
awaiting
his
commands
mistress
westmacott
is
leaving
he
informed
his
servant
and
bowed
low
and
formally
in
farewell
before
her
she
passed
out
without
another
word
the
old
butler
following
and
presently
through
the
door
that
remained
open
came
trenchard
in
quest
of
wilding
who
stood
bemused
nick
sauntered
in
his
left
eye
almost
hidden
by
the
rakish
cock
of
his
hat
one
hand
tucked
away
under
the
skirts
of
his
coat
the
other
supporting
the
stem
of
a
long
clay
pipe
at
which
he
was
pulling
thoughtfully
the
pipe
and
he
were
all
but
inseparable
indeed
the
year
before
in
london
he
had
given
appalling
scandal
by
appearing
with
it
in
the
mall
and
had
there
remained
him
any
character
to
lose
he
must
assuredly
have
lost
it
then
he
observed
his
friend
through
narrowing
eyes
he
had
small
eyes
very
blue
and
very
bright
in
which
there
usually
abode
a
roguish
gleam
my
sight
anthony
said
he
reminds
me
that
i
am
growing
old
i
wonder
did
it
mislead
me
on
the
score
of
your
visitor
the
lady
who
left
said
wilding
with
a
touch
of
severity
will
be
mistress
wilding
by
this
day
trenchard
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
audibly
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
stared
at
his
friend
body
o
me
quoth
he
is
this
a
time
for
marrying
with
these
rumours
of
monmouth
coming
wilding
made
an
impatient
gesture
i
thought
to
have
convinced
you
they
are
idle
said
he
and
flung
himself
into
a
chair
at
his
nick
came
over
and
perched
himself
upon
the
table
edge
one
leg
swinging
in
the
air
and
what
of
this
matter
of
the
intercepted
letter
from
london
to
our
taunton
friends
i
ca
tell
you
but
of
this
i
am
sure
his
grace
is
incapable
of
anything
so
rash
certain
is
it
that
he
not
stir
until
battiscomb
returns
to
holland
and
battiscomb
is
still
in
cheshire
sounding
the
duke
yet
were
i
you
i
should
not
marry
just
at
wilding
smiled
if
you
were
me
you
never
marry
at
faith
no
said
trenchard
i
as
soon
play
at
or
is
a
mort
more
amusing
and
the
sooner
done
chapter
the
encounter
ruth
wesmacott
rode
back
like
one
in
a
dream
with
vague
and
hazy
notions
of
what
she
saw
or
did
so
overwrought
was
she
by
the
interview
from
which
she
came
her
mind
so
obsessed
by
it
that
never
a
thought
had
she
for
diana
and
her
indisposition
until
she
arrived
home
to
find
her
cousin
there
before
her
diana
was
in
tears
called
up
by
the
reproaches
of
her
mother
lady
horton
the
relict
of
that
fine
soldier
sir
cholmondeley
horton
of
taunton
the
girl
had
arrived
at
lupton
house
a
ahead
of
miss
westmacott
and
upon
her
arrival
she
had
expressed
surprise
either
feigned
or
real
at
finding
ruth
still
absent
detecting
the
alarm
that
diana
was
careful
to
throw
into
her
voice
and
manner
her
mother
questioned
her
and
elicited
the
story
of
her
faintness
and
of
having
ridden
on
alone
to
wilding
so
outraged
was
lady
horton
that
for
once
in
a
way
this
woman
usually
so
meek
and
was
roused
to
an
energy
and
anger
with
her
daughter
and
her
niece
that
threatened
to
remove
diana
at
once
from
the
pernicious
atmosphere
of
lupton
house
and
carry
her
home
to
taunton
ruth
found
her
still
at
her
remonstrances
arrived
indeed
in
time
for
her
share
of
them
i
have
been
sore
mistaken
in
you
ruth
the
dame
reproached
her
i
can
scarce
believe
it
of
you
i
have
held
you
up
as
an
example
to
diana
for
the
discretion
and
wisdom
of
your
conduct
and
you
do
this
you
go
alone
to
wilding
house
to
wilding
of
all
men
it
was
no
time
for
ordinary
measures
said
ruth
but
she
spoke
without
any
of
the
heat
of
one
who
defends
her
conduct
she
was
the
slyly
watchful
diana
observed
very
white
and
tired
it
was
no
time
to
think
of
nice
conduct
there
was
richard
to
be
and
was
it
worth
ruining
yourself
to
do
that
quoth
lady
horton
her
colour
high
ruining
myself
echoed
ruth
and
she
smiled
never
so
weary
a
smile
i
have
indeed
done
that
though
not
in
the
way
you
mother
and
daughter
eyed
her
mystified
your
good
name
is
blasted
said
her
aunt
unless
so
be
that
wilding
is
proposing
to
make
you
his
it
was
a
sneer
the
good
woman
could
not
in
her
indignation
repress
that
is
what
wilding
has
done
me
the
honour
to
propose
ruth
answered
bitterly
and
left
them
gaping
we
are
to
be
married
this
day
a
dead
silence
followed
the
calm
announcement
then
diana
rose
at
the
misery
the
anguish
that
could
impress
so
strange
and
white
a
look
on
ruth
winsome
face
she
was
smitten
with
remorse
her
incipient
satisfaction
dashed
this
was
her
work
the
fruit
of
her
scheming
but
it
had
gone
further
than
she
had
foreseen
and
for
all
that
no
result
could
better
harmonize
with
her
own
ambitions
and
desires
for
the
moment
under
the
first
shock
of
that
announcement
she
felt
guilty
and
grew
afraid
ruth
she
cried
her
voice
a
whisper
of
stupefaction
oh
i
wish
i
had
come
with
you
but
you
could
you
were
and
then
recalling
what
had
passed
her
mind
was
filled
with
sudden
concern
for
diana
even
amid
her
own
sore
troubles
are
you
quite
yourself
again
diana
she
inquired
diana
answered
almost
fiercely
i
am
quite
and
then
with
a
change
to
wistfulness
she
added
oh
i
would
i
had
come
with
you
matters
had
been
no
different
ruth
assured
her
it
was
a
bargain
wilding
drove
it
was
the
price
i
had
to
pay
for
richard
life
and
she
swallowed
hard
and
let
her
hands
fall
limply
to
her
sides
where
is
richard
she
inquired
it
was
her
aunt
who
answered
her
he
went
forth
half
an
hour
agone
with
vallancey
and
sir
sir
rowland
had
returned
then
she
looked
up
quickly
yes
answered
diana
but
he
had
achieved
nothing
by
his
visit
to
lord
gervase
his
lordship
would
not
intervene
he
swore
he
hoped
the
cub
would
be
flayed
alive
by
wilding
those
were
his
lordship
words
as
sir
rowland
repeated
them
sir
rowland
is
in
sore
distress
for
richard
he
has
gone
with
them
to
the
at
least
he
has
no
longer
cause
for
his
distress
said
miss
westmacott
with
her
bitter
smile
and
sank
as
one
exhausted
to
a
chair
lady
horton
moved
to
comfort
her
her
motherliness
all
aroused
for
this
motherless
girl
usually
so
wise
and
strong
and
seemingly
wiser
and
stronger
than
ever
in
this
thing
that
lady
horton
had
deemed
a
weakness
and
a
folly
meanwhile
richard
and
his
two
friends
were
on
their
way
to
the
moors
across
the
river
to
the
encounter
with
wilding
but
before
they
had
got
him
to
ride
forth
vallancey
had
had
occasion
to
regret
that
he
stood
committed
to
a
share
in
this
quarrel
for
he
came
to
know
richard
as
he
really
was
he
had
found
him
in
an
abject
state
white
and
trembling
his
coward
fancy
anticipating
a
hundred
times
a
minute
the
death
he
was
anon
to
die
vallancey
had
hailed
him
cheerily
the
day
is
yours
dick
he
had
cried
when
richard
entered
the
library
where
he
awaited
him
wild
wilding
has
ridden
to
taunton
this
morning
and
is
to
be
back
by
noon
odsbud
dick
twenty
miles
and
more
in
the
saddle
before
coming
on
the
ground
heard
you
ever
of
the
like
madness
he
be
stiff
as
a
an
easy
richard
listened
stared
and
finding
vallancey
eyes
fixed
steadily
upon
him
attempted
a
smile
and
achieved
a
horrible
grimace
what
ails
you
man
cried
his
second
and
caught
him
by
the
wrist
he
felt
the
quiver
of
the
other
limb
stab
me
quoth
he
you
are
in
no
case
to
fight
what
the
plague
ails
you
i
am
none
so
well
this
morning
answered
richard
feebly
lord
gervase
claret
he
added
passing
a
hand
across
his
brow
lord
gervase
claret
echoed
vallancey
in
horror
as
at
some
outrageous
blasphemy
frontignac
at
ten
shillings
the
bottle
he
exclaimed
still
claret
never
does
lie
easy
on
my
stomach
richard
explained
intent
upon
blaming
lord
gervase
s
wine
since
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
for
his
condition
vallancey
looked
at
him
shrewdly
my
cock
said
he
if
you
to
fight
we
have
to
mend
your
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
ring
the
bell
and
to
order
up
two
bottles
of
canary
and
one
of
brandy
if
he
was
to
get
his
man
to
the
ground
at
all
and
young
vallancey
had
a
due
sense
of
his
responsibilities
in
that
connection
it
would
be
well
to
supply
richard
with
something
to
replace
the
courage
that
had
oozed
out
overnight
young
richard
never
loath
to
fortify
himself
proved
amenable
enough
to
the
stiffly
laced
canary
that
his
friend
set
before
him
then
to
divert
his
mind
vallancey
with
that
rash
freedom
that
had
made
the
whole
of
somerset
know
him
for
a
rebel
set
himself
to
talk
of
the
protestant
duke
and
his
right
to
the
crown
of
england
he
was
still
at
his
talk
richard
listening
moodily
what
time
he
was
slowly
but
surely
befuddling
himself
when
sir
rowland
returning
from
scoresby
hall
came
to
bring
the
news
of
his
lack
of
success
richard
hailed
him
noisily
and
bade
him
ring
for
another
glass
adding
with
a
burst
of
oaths
some
appalling
threats
of
how
anon
he
should
serve
anthony
wilding
his
wits
drowned
in
the
stiff
liquor
vallancey
had
pressed
upon
him
he
seemed
of
a
sudden
to
have
grown
as
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
as
any
scourer
that
ever
terrorized
the
watch
blake
listened
to
him
and
grunted
body
o
me
swore
the
town
gallant
if
that
the
humour
you
going
out
to
fight
in
i
trouble
you
for
the
eight
guineas
i
won
from
you
at
primero
yesterday
before
you
richard
reared
himself
by
the
help
of
the
table
and
stood
a
thought
unsteadily
his
glance
laboriously
striving
to
engage
blake
damn
me
quoth
he
your
want
of
faith
dishgraces
me
and
you
shalt
ha
the
guineas
when
we
back
and
not
hum
quoth
blake
to
whom
eight
guineas
were
a
consideration
in
these
bankrupt
days
and
if
you
do
come
back
at
all
upon
whom
am
i
to
draw
the
suggestion
sank
through
dick
senses
and
the
scare
it
gave
him
was
reflected
on
his
face
damn
you
blake
swore
vallancey
between
his
teeth
is
that
a
decent
way
to
talk
to
a
man
who
is
going
out
never
heed
him
dick
let
him
wait
for
his
dirty
guineas
till
we
thirty
guineas
hiccoughed
richard
it
was
only
eight
anyhow
wait
i
sli
the
gullet
of
he
checked
on
a
thought
that
suddenly
occurred
to
him
he
turned
to
vallancey
with
a
ludicrous
solemnity
he
swore
a
scurvy
trick
i
playing
the
duke
treason
to
him
treason
no
and
he
smote
the
table
with
his
open
hand
what
that
quoth
blake
so
sharply
his
eyes
so
suddenly
alert
that
vallancey
made
haste
to
cover
up
his
fellow
rebel
indiscretion
it
the
makes
him
dream
said
he
with
a
laugh
and
rising
as
he
spoke
he
announced
that
it
was
high
time
they
should
set
out
thus
he
brought
about
a
bustle
that
drove
the
duke
business
from
richard
mind
and
left
blake
without
a
pretext
to
pursue
his
quest
for
information
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
blake
suspicions
were
awake
he
bethought
him
now
of
dark
hints
that
richard
had
let
fall
to
vallancey
in
the
past
few
days
and
of
hints
less
dark
with
which
vallancey
who
was
a
careless
fellow
at
ordinary
times
had
answered
and
now
this
mention
of
the
duke
and
of
treason
to
him
to
what
duke
could
it
refer
but
monmouth
blake
was
well
aware
of
the
wild
tales
that
were
going
round
and
he
began
to
wonder
now
was
aught
really
afoot
and
was
his
good
friend
westmacott
in
it
if
there
was
he
bethought
him
that
the
knowledge
might
be
of
value
and
it
might
help
to
float
once
more
his
shipwrecked
fortunes
the
haste
with
which
vallancey
had
proffered
a
frivolous
explanation
of
words
the
bustle
with
which
upon
the
instant
he
swept
richard
and
sir
rowland
from
the
house
to
get
to
horse
and
ride
out
to
bridgwater
were
in
themselves
circumstances
that
went
to
heighten
those
suspicions
of
sir
rowland
but
lacking
all
opportunity
for
investigation
at
the
moment
he
deemed
it
wisest
to
say
no
more
just
then
lest
he
should
betray
his
watchfulness
they
were
the
first
to
arrive
upon
the
ground
an
open
space
on
the
borders
of
sedgemoor
in
the
shelter
of
polden
hill
but
they
had
not
long
to
wait
before
wilding
and
trenchard
rode
up
attended
by
a
groom
their
arrival
had
an
oddly
sobering
effect
upon
young
westmacott
for
which
vallancey
was
thankful
for
during
their
ride
he
had
begun
to
fear
that
he
had
carried
too
far
the
business
of
equipping
his
principal
with
artificial
valour
trenchard
came
forward
to
offer
vallancey
the
courteous
suggestion
that
wilding
servant
should
charge
himself
with
the
care
of
the
horses
of
westmacott
party
if
this
would
be
a
convenience
to
them
vallancey
thanked
him
and
accepted
the
offer
and
thus
the
groom
instructed
by
trenchard
led
the
five
horses
some
distance
from
the
spot
it
now
became
a
matter
of
making
preparation
and
leaving
richard
to
divest
himself
of
such
garments
as
he
might
deem
cumbrous
vallancey
went
forward
to
consult
with
trenchard
upon
the
choice
of
ground
at
that
same
moment
wilding
lounged
forward
flicking
the
grass
with
his
whip
in
an
absent
manner
mr
vallancey
he
began
when
trenchard
turned
to
interrupt
him
you
can
leave
it
safely
to
me
tony
he
growled
but
there
is
something
i
wish
to
say
nick
answered
wilding
his
manner
mild
by
your
leave
and
he
turned
again
to
valiancey
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
call
westmacott
hither
vallancey
stared
for
what
purpose
sir
he
asked
for
my
purpose
answered
wilding
sweetly
it
is
no
longer
my
wish
to
engage
with
westmacott
anthony
cried
trenchard
and
in
his
amazement
forgot
to
swear
i
propose
added
wilding
to
relieve
westmacott
of
the
necessity
of
vallancey
in
his
heart
thought
this
might
be
pleasant
news
for
his
principal
still
he
did
not
quite
see
how
the
end
was
to
be
attained
and
said
so
you
shall
be
enlightened
if
you
will
do
as
i
request
wilding
insisted
and
vallancey
with
a
lift
of
the
brows
a
snort
and
a
shrug
turned
away
to
comply
do
you
mean
quoth
trenchard
bursting
with
indignation
that
you
will
let
live
a
man
who
has
struck
you
wilding
took
his
friend
affectionately
by
the
arm
it
is
a
whim
of
mine
said
he
do
you
think
nick
that
it
is
more
than
i
can
afford
to
indulge
i
say
not
so
was
the
ready
answer
but
i
thought
you
not
said
wilding
interrupting
and
if
any
does
why
i
shall
be
glad
to
prove
it
upon
him
that
he
he
laughed
and
trenchard
vexed
though
he
was
was
forced
to
laugh
with
him
then
nick
set
himself
to
urge
the
thing
that
last
night
had
plagued
his
mind
that
this
richard
might
prove
a
danger
to
the
cause
that
in
the
duke
interest
if
not
to
safeguard
his
own
person
from
some
vindictive
betrayal
wilding
would
be
better
advised
in
imposing
a
reliable
silence
upon
him
but
why
vindictive
wilding
remonstrated
rather
must
he
have
cause
for
trenchard
laughed
short
and
contemptuously
there
is
said
he
no
rancour
more
bitter
than
that
of
the
mean
man
who
has
offended
you
and
whom
you
have
spared
i
beg
you
ponder
he
lowered
his
voice
as
he
ended
his
admonition
for
vallancey
and
westmacott
were
coming
up
followed
by
sir
rowland
blake
richard
although
his
courage
had
been
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
a
measure
as
he
had
grown
more
and
more
sober
with
the
approach
of
the
moment
for
engaging
came
forward
now
with
a
firm
step
and
an
arrogant
mien
for
vallancey
had
given
him
more
than
a
hint
of
what
was
toward
his
heart
had
leapt
not
only
at
the
deliverance
that
was
promised
him
but
out
of
satisfaction
at
the
reflection
of
how
accurately
last
night
he
had
gauged
what
wilding
would
endure
it
had
dismayed
him
then
as
we
have
seen
that
this
man
who
he
thought
must
stomach
any
affront
from
him
out
of
consideration
for
his
sister
should
have
ended
by
calling
him
to
account
he
concluded
now
that
upon
reflection
wilding
had
seen
his
error
and
was
prepared
to
make
amends
that
he
might
extricate
himself
from
an
impossible
situation
and
richard
blamed
himself
for
having
overlooked
this
inevitable
solution
and
given
way
to
idle
panic
vallancey
and
blake
watching
him
and
the
sudden
metamorphosis
that
was
wrought
in
him
despised
him
heartily
and
yet
were
glad
for
the
sake
of
their
association
with
him
that
things
were
as
they
were
mr
westmacott
said
wilding
quietly
his
eyes
steadily
set
upon
richard
own
arrogant
gaze
his
lips
smiling
a
little
i
am
here
not
to
fight
but
to
richard
sneer
was
audible
to
all
oh
he
was
gathering
courage
fast
now
that
there
no
longer
was
the
need
for
it
it
urged
him
to
lengths
of
daring
possible
only
to
a
fool
if
you
can
take
a
blow
wilding
said
he
offensively
that
is
your
own
and
his
friends
gasped
at
his
temerity
and
trembled
for
him
not
knowing
what
grounds
he
had
for
counting
himself
unassailable
just
so
said
wilding
as
meek
and
humble
as
a
nun
and
trenchard
who
had
expected
something
very
different
from
him
swore
aloud
and
with
some
circumstance
of
oaths
the
fact
is
continued
wilding
that
what
i
did
last
night
i
did
in
the
heat
of
wine
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
recognize
that
this
quarrel
is
of
my
provoking
that
it
was
unwarrantable
in
me
to
introduce
the
name
of
mistress
westmacott
no
matter
how
respectfully
and
that
in
doing
so
i
gave
westmacott
ample
grounds
for
offence
for
that
i
beg
his
pardon
and
i
venture
to
hope
that
this
matter
need
go
no
vallancey
and
blake
were
speechless
in
astonishment
trenchard
livid
with
fury
westmacott
moved
a
step
or
two
forward
a
swagger
unmistakable
in
his
gait
his
thrust
out
in
a
sneer
why
said
he
his
voice
mighty
disdainful
if
wilding
apologizes
the
matter
hardly
can
go
he
conveyed
such
a
suggestion
of
regret
at
this
that
trenchard
bounded
forward
stung
to
speech
but
if
westmacott
disappointment
threatens
to
overwhelm
him
he
snapped
very
tartly
i
am
his
humble
servant
and
he
may
call
upon
me
to
see
that
he
not
robbed
of
the
exercise
he
came
to
wilding
set
a
restraining
hand
upon
trenchard
arm
westmacott
turned
to
him
the
sneer
however
gone
from
his
face
i
have
no
quarrel
with
you
sir
said
he
with
an
uneasy
assumption
of
dignity
it
a
want
that
may
be
soon
supplied
answered
trenchard
briskly
and
as
he
afterwards
confessed
had
not
wilding
checked
him
at
that
moment
he
had
thrown
his
hat
in
richard
face
it
was
vallancey
who
saved
the
situation
cursing
in
his
heart
the
bearing
of
his
principal
mr
wilding
said
he
this
is
very
handsome
in
you
you
are
of
the
happy
few
who
may
tender
such
an
apology
without
reflection
upon
your
wilding
made
him
a
leg
very
elegantly
you
are
vastly
kind
sir
said
he
you
have
given
westmacott
the
fullest
satisfaction
and
it
is
with
an
increased
respect
for
you
if
that
were
possible
that
i
acknowledge
it
on
my
friend
you
are
sir
a
very
mirror
of
the
elegancies
said
wilding
and
vallancey
wondered
was
he
being
laughed
at
whether
he
was
or
not
he
conceived
that
he
had
done
the
only
seemly
thing
he
had
made
handsome
acknowledgment
of
a
handsome
apology
stung
to
it
by
the
currishness
of
richard
and
there
the
matter
ended
despite
trenchard
burning
eagerness
to
carry
it
himself
to
a
different
consummation
wilding
prevailed
upon
him
and
withdrew
him
from
the
field
but
as
they
rode
back
to
zoyland
chase
the
old
rake
was
bitter
in
his
inveighings
against
wilding
folly
and
weakness
i
pray
heaven
he
kept
repeating
that
it
may
not
come
to
cost
you
have
done
said
wilding
a
trifle
out
of
patience
could
i
wed
the
sister
having
slain
the
brother
and
trenchard
understanding
at
last
accounted
himself
a
numskull
that
he
had
not
understood
before
but
he
none
the
less
deemed
it
a
pity
richard
had
been
spared
chapter
vi
the
champion
as
vainglorious
was
richard
westmacott
retreat
from
the
field
of
unstricken
battle
as
his
advance
upon
it
had
been
inglorious
he
spoke
with
confidence
now
of
the
narrow
escape
that
wilding
had
had
at
his
hands
of
the
things
he
would
have
done
to
wilding
had
not
that
gentleman
grown
wise
in
time
sir
rowland
who
had
seen
little
of
richard
earlier
stricken
condition
was
in
a
measure
imposed
upon
by
his
blustering
tone
and
manner
not
so
vallancey
who
remembered
the
steps
he
had
been
forced
to
take
to
bolster
up
the
young
man
courage
sufficiently
to
admit
of
his
being
brought
to
the
encounter
richard
so
disgusted
him
that
he
felt
if
he
did
not
quit
his
company
soon
he
would
be
quarrelling
with
him
himself
so
congratulating
him
in
a
caustic
manner
that
richard
did
not
relish
upon
the
happy
termination
of
the
affair
vallancey
took
his
leave
of
him
and
blake
at
the
pleading
business
with
lord
gervase
and
left
them
to
proceed
without
him
to
bridgwater
blake
whose
suspicions
of
some
secret
matter
to
which
vallancey
and
richard
were
wedded
had
been
earlier
excited
by
indiscretions
was
full
of
sly
questions
now
touching
the
business
which
might
be
taking
vallancey
to
scoresby
but
richard
was
too
full
of
the
subject
of
the
fear
he
had
instilled
into
wilding
to
afford
his
companion
much
satisfaction
on
any
other
score
thus
they
came
to
lupton
house
and
as
richard
swaggered
down
the
lawn
into
the
presence
of
the
ladies
ruth
and
her
aunt
were
occupying
the
stone
bench
diana
the
circular
seat
about
the
great
oak
in
the
centre
of
the
lawn
he
was
a
very
different
person
from
the
pale
limp
creature
they
had
beheld
there
some
few
hours
earlier
loud
and
offensive
was
he
now
in
and
so
indifferent
to
all
else
that
he
left
unobserved
the
little
smile
half
wistful
half
scornful
that
visited
his
sister
lips
when
he
sneeringly
told
how
wilding
had
chosen
that
better
part
of
valour
which
discretion
is
alleged
to
be
it
needed
diana
who
blinded
by
no
sisterly
affection
saw
him
exactly
as
he
was
and
despised
him
accordingly
to
enlighten
him
it
may
also
be
that
in
doing
so
at
once
she
had
ends
of
her
own
to
serve
for
sir
rowland
was
still
of
the
company
mr
wilding
afraid
she
cried
her
voice
so
charged
with
derision
that
it
inclined
to
shrillness
la
richard
wilding
was
never
afraid
of
any
faith
said
rowland
although
his
acquaintance
with
wilding
was
slight
and
recent
it
is
what
i
should
think
he
does
not
look
like
a
man
familiar
with
richard
struck
something
of
an
attitude
his
fair
face
flushed
his
pale
eyes
glittering
he
took
a
blow
said
he
and
sneered
there
may
have
been
reasons
diana
suggested
darkly
and
sir
eyes
narrowed
at
the
hint
again
he
recalled
the
words
richard
had
let
fall
that
afternoon
wilding
and
he
were
fellow
workers
in
some
secret
business
and
richard
had
said
that
the
encounter
was
treason
to
that
same
business
whatever
it
might
be
and
of
what
it
might
be
sir
rowland
had
grounds
upon
which
to
found
at
least
a
guess
had
perhaps
wilding
acted
upon
some
similar
feelings
in
avoiding
the
duel
he
wondered
and
when
richard
dismissed
challenge
with
a
fatuous
laugh
it
was
blake
who
took
it
up
you
speak
said
he
as
if
you
knew
that
there
were
reasons
and
knew
too
what
those
reasons
might
diana
looked
at
ruth
as
if
for
guidance
before
replying
but
ruth
sat
calm
and
seemingly
impassive
looking
straight
before
her
she
was
indeed
indifferent
how
much
diana
said
for
in
any
case
the
matter
could
not
remain
a
secret
long
lady
horton
silent
too
and
listening
looked
a
question
at
her
daughter
and
so
after
a
pause
i
know
both
said
diana
her
eyes
straying
again
to
ruth
and
a
subtler
man
than
blake
would
have
read
that
glance
and
understood
that
this
same
reason
which
he
sought
so
diligently
sat
there
before
him
richard
indeed
catching
that
sly
look
of
his
cousin
checked
his
assurance
and
stood
frowning
cogitating
then
quite
suddenly
his
voice
harsh
what
do
you
mean
diana
he
inquired
diana
shrugged
and
turned
her
shoulder
to
him
you
had
best
ask
ruth
said
she
which
was
an
answer
more
or
less
plain
to
both
the
men
they
stood
at
gaze
richard
looking
a
thought
foolish
blake
frowning
his
heavy
lip
caught
in
his
strong
white
teeth
ruth
turned
to
her
brother
with
an
almost
piteous
attempt
at
a
smile
she
sought
to
spare
him
pain
by
excluding
from
her
manner
all
suggestion
that
things
were
other
than
she
desired
i
am
betrothed
to
wilding
said
she
sir
rowland
made
a
sudden
forward
movement
drew
a
deep
breath
and
as
suddenly
stood
still
richard
looked
at
his
sister
as
she
were
mad
and
raving
then
he
laughed
between
unbelief
and
derision
it
is
a
jest
said
he
but
his
accents
lacked
conviction
it
is
the
truth
ruth
assured
him
quietly
the
truth
his
brow
darkened
ominously
stupendously
for
one
so
fair
the
truth
you
baggage
he
began
and
stopped
in
very
fury
she
saw
that
she
must
tell
him
all
i
promised
to
wed
wilding
this
day
so
that
he
saved
your
life
and
honour
she
told
him
calmly
and
added
it
was
a
bargain
that
we
richard
continued
to
stare
at
her
the
thing
she
told
him
was
too
big
to
be
swallowed
at
a
mouthful
he
was
absorbing
it
by
slow
degrees
so
now
said
diana
you
know
the
sacrifice
your
sister
has
made
to
save
you
and
when
you
speak
of
the
apology
wilding
tendered
you
perhaps
you
speak
of
it
in
a
tone
less
but
the
sarcasm
was
no
longer
needed
already
poor
richard
was
very
humble
his
spirit
all
snuffed
out
he
observed
at
last
how
pale
and
set
was
his
sister
face
and
he
realized
something
of
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
never
in
all
his
life
was
richard
so
near
to
lapsing
from
the
love
of
himself
never
so
near
to
forgetting
his
own
interests
and
preferring
those
of
ruth
lady
horton
sat
silent
her
heart
fluttering
with
dismay
and
perplexity
heaven
had
not
equipped
her
with
a
spirit
capable
of
dealing
with
a
situation
such
as
this
blake
stood
in
make
believe
stolidity
dissembling
his
infinite
chagrin
and
the
stormy
emotions
warring
within
him
for
some
signs
of
which
diana
watched
his
countenance
in
vain
you
shall
not
do
it
cried
richard
suddenly
he
came
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
sister
shoulder
his
voice
was
almost
gentle
ruth
you
shall
not
do
this
for
me
you
must
by
heaven
no
snapped
blake
before
she
could
reply
you
are
right
richard
mistress
westmacott
must
not
be
the
scapegoat
she
shall
not
play
the
part
of
but
ruth
smiled
wistfully
as
she
answered
him
with
a
question
where
is
the
help
for
it
richard
knew
where
the
help
for
it
lay
and
for
once
for
just
a
moment
he
contemplated
danger
and
even
death
with
equanimity
i
can
take
up
this
quarrel
again
he
announced
i
can
compel
wilding
to
meet
ruth
eyes
looking
up
at
him
kindled
with
pride
and
admiration
it
warmed
her
heart
to
hear
him
speak
thus
to
have
this
assurance
that
he
was
anything
but
the
coward
she
had
been
so
disloyal
as
to
deem
him
no
doubt
she
had
been
right
in
saying
that
it
was
his
health
was
the
cause
of
the
palsy
he
had
displayed
that
morning
he
was
a
little
wild
she
knew
inclined
to
sit
at
the
bottle
with
advancing
manhood
she
had
no
doubt
he
would
overcome
this
boyish
failing
meanwhile
it
was
this
foolish
habit
nothing
more
that
undermined
the
inherent
firmness
of
his
nature
and
it
comforted
her
generous
soul
to
have
this
proof
that
he
was
full
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
she
was
making
for
him
diana
watched
him
in
some
surprise
and
never
doubted
but
that
his
offer
was
impulsive
and
that
he
would
regret
it
when
his
ardour
had
had
time
to
cool
it
were
idle
said
ruth
at
last
not
that
she
quite
believed
it
but
that
it
was
to
her
that
richard
should
not
be
imperilled
mr
wilding
will
prefer
the
bargain
he
has
no
doubt
growled
blake
but
he
shall
be
forced
to
unmake
he
advanced
and
bowed
low
before
her
madam
said
he
will
you
grant
me
leave
to
champion
your
cause
and
remove
this
troublesome
wilding
from
your
path
diana
eyes
narrowed
her
cheeks
paled
partly
from
fear
for
blake
partly
from
vexation
at
the
promptness
of
an
offer
that
afforded
a
fresh
and
so
eloquent
proof
of
the
trend
of
his
affections
ruth
smiled
at
him
in
a
very
friendly
manner
but
gently
shook
her
head
i
thank
you
sir
said
she
but
it
were
more
than
i
could
permit
this
has
become
a
family
there
was
in
her
tone
something
which
despite
its
friendliness
gave
sir
rowland
his
dismissal
he
was
not
at
best
a
man
of
keen
sensibilities
yet
even
so
he
could
not
mistake
the
request
to
withdraw
that
was
implicit
in
her
tone
and
manner
he
took
his
leave
registering
however
in
his
heart
a
vow
that
he
would
have
his
way
with
wilding
thus
must
he
through
her
gratitude
assuredly
come
to
have
his
way
with
ruth
diana
rose
and
turned
to
her
mother
come
she
said
we
speed
sir
rowland
ruth
and
richard
would
perhaps
prefer
to
remain
ruth
thanked
her
with
her
eyes
richard
standing
beside
his
sister
with
bent
head
and
moody
gaze
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
thus
he
remained
until
he
and
his
were
alone
together
then
he
flung
himself
wearily
into
the
seat
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
ruth
he
faltered
ruth
she
stroked
his
hand
her
honest
intelligent
eyes
bent
upon
him
in
a
look
of
pity
and
to
indulge
this
pity
for
him
she
forgot
how
much
herself
she
needed
pity
take
it
not
so
to
heart
she
urged
him
her
voice
low
and
crooning
as
that
of
a
mother
to
her
babe
take
it
not
so
to
heart
richard
i
should
have
married
some
day
and
after
all
it
may
well
be
that
wilding
will
make
me
as
good
a
husband
as
another
i
do
believe
she
added
her
only
intent
to
comfort
richard
that
he
loves
me
and
if
he
loves
me
surely
he
will
prove
he
flung
himself
back
with
an
exclamation
of
angry
pain
he
was
white
to
the
lips
his
eyes
bloodshot
it
must
not
be
it
shall
not
be
i
not
endure
it
he
cried
hoarsely
richard
dear
she
began
recapturing
the
hand
he
had
snatched
from
hers
in
his
gust
of
emotion
he
rose
abruptly
interrupting
her
i
go
to
wilding
now
he
cried
his
voice
resolute
he
shall
cancel
this
bargain
he
had
no
right
to
make
he
shall
take
up
his
quarrel
with
me
where
it
stood
before
you
went
to
no
no
richard
you
must
not
she
urged
him
frightened
rising
too
and
clinging
to
his
arm
i
will
he
answered
at
the
worst
he
can
but
kill
me
but
at
least
you
shall
not
be
sit
here
richard
she
bade
him
there
is
something
you
have
not
considered
if
you
die
if
wilding
kills
you
she
paused
he
looked
at
her
and
at
the
repetition
of
the
fate
that
would
probably
await
him
if
he
persevered
in
the
course
he
threatened
his
purely
emotional
courage
again
began
to
fail
him
a
look
of
fear
crept
gradually
into
his
face
to
take
the
room
of
the
resolution
that
had
been
stamped
upon
it
but
a
moment
since
he
swallowed
hard
what
then
he
asked
his
voice
harsh
and
obeying
her
command
and
the
pressure
on
his
hand
he
resumed
his
seat
beside
her
she
spoke
now
at
length
and
very
gravely
dwelling
upon
the
circumstance
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
family
the
last
westmacott
of
his
line
pointing
out
to
him
the
importance
of
his
existence
the
insignificance
of
her
own
she
was
but
a
girl
a
thing
of
small
account
where
the
perpetuation
of
a
family
was
at
issue
after
all
she
must
marry
somebody
some
day
she
repeated
and
perhaps
she
had
been
foolish
in
attaching
too
much
importance
to
the
tales
she
had
heard
of
wilding
probably
he
was
no
worse
than
other
men
and
after
all
he
was
a
gentleman
of
wealth
and
position
such
a
man
as
half
the
women
in
somerset
might
be
proud
to
own
for
husband
her
arguments
and
his
weakness
his
returning
cowardice
which
made
him
lend
an
ear
to
those
same
arguments
prevailed
with
him
at
least
they
convinced
him
that
he
was
far
too
important
a
person
to
risk
his
life
in
this
quarrel
upon
which
he
had
so
rashly
entered
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
convinced
but
he
said
that
he
would
give
the
matter
thought
hinting
that
perhaps
some
other
way
might
present
itself
of
cancelling
the
bargain
she
had
made
they
had
a
week
before
them
and
in
any
case
he
promised
readily
in
answer
to
her
entreaties
for
her
faith
in
him
was
a
thing
unquenchable
that
he
would
do
nothing
without
taking
counsel
with
her
meanwhile
diana
had
escorted
sir
rowland
to
the
main
gates
of
lupton
house
in
front
of
which
miss
westmacott
groom
was
walking
his
horse
awaiting
him
sir
rowland
said
she
at
parting
your
chivalry
makes
you
take
this
matter
too
deeply
to
heart
you
overlook
the
possibility
that
my
cousin
may
have
good
reason
for
not
desiring
your
he
looked
keenly
at
this
little
lady
to
whom
a
month
ago
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
offering
marriage
his
coxcombry
might
readily
have
suggested
to
him
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
but
that
his
conscience
and
inclinations
urged
him
to
assure
himself
that
this
was
not
the
case
what
shall
that
mean
madam
he
asked
her
diana
hesitated
what
i
have
said
is
plain
she
answered
and
it
was
clear
that
she
held
something
back
sir
rowland
flattered
himself
upon
the
shrewdness
with
which
he
read
her
never
dreaming
that
he
had
but
read
just
what
she
intended
he
should
he
stood
squarely
before
her
shaking
his
great
head
not
plain
enough
for
me
he
said
then
his
tone
softened
to
one
of
prayer
tell
me
he
besought
her
i
ca
i
ca
she
cried
in
feigned
distress
it
were
too
he
frowned
he
caught
her
arm
and
pressed
it
his
heart
sick
with
jealous
alarm
what
do
you
mean
tell
me
tell
me
mistress
diana
lowered
her
eyes
you
not
betray
me
she
stipulated
why
no
tell
she
flushed
delicately
i
am
disloyal
to
ruth
she
said
and
yet
i
am
loath
to
see
you
cozened
quoth
he
hoarsely
his
egregious
vanity
in
arms
cozened
diana
explained
ruth
was
at
his
house
said
she
closeted
alone
with
him
for
an
hour
or
impossible
he
cried
where
else
was
the
bargain
made
she
asked
and
shattered
his
last
doubt
you
know
that
wilding
has
not
been
yet
blake
struggled
heroically
against
conviction
she
went
to
intercede
for
richard
he
protested
miss
horton
looked
up
at
him
and
under
her
glance
sir
rowland
felt
that
he
was
a
man
of
unfathomable
ignorance
then
she
turned
aside
her
eyes
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
very
eloquently
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
sir
rowland
you
can
not
seriously
suppose
that
any
maid
would
so
imperil
her
good
name
in
any
cause
darker
grew
his
florid
countenance
his
bulging
eyes
looked
troubled
and
perplexed
you
mean
that
she
loves
him
he
said
between
question
and
assertion
diana
pursed
her
lips
you
shall
draw
your
own
inference
quoth
she
he
breathed
heavily
and
squared
his
broad
shoulders
as
one
who
braces
himself
for
battle
against
an
element
stronger
than
himself
but
her
talk
of
sacrifice
he
cried
diana
laughed
and
again
he
was
stung
by
her
contempt
of
his
perceptions
her
brother
is
set
against
her
marrying
him
said
she
here
was
her
chance
is
it
not
very
plain
doubt
stared
from
his
eyes
why
do
you
tell
me
this
because
i
esteem
you
sir
rowland
she
answered
very
gently
i
would
not
have
you
meddle
in
a
matter
you
can
not
which
i
am
not
desired
to
mend
say
rather
he
replied
with
heavy
sarcasm
she
would
not
have
my
interference
he
laughed
angrily
i
think
you
are
right
mistress
diana
he
said
and
i
think
that
more
than
ever
is
there
the
need
to
kill
this
he
took
his
departure
abruptly
leaving
her
scared
at
the
mischief
she
had
made
for
him
in
seeking
to
save
him
from
it
and
that
very
night
he
sought
out
wilding
but
wilding
was
from
home
again
under
its
placid
surface
the
west
country
was
in
a
ferment
and
if
hitherto
wilding
had
disdained
the
insistent
rumours
of
monmouth
coming
his
assurance
was
shaken
now
by
proof
that
the
government
itself
was
stirring
for
four
companies
of
foot
and
a
troop
of
horse
had
been
that
day
ordered
to
taunton
by
the
wilding
was
gone
with
trenchard
to
white
lackington
in
a
vain
hope
that
there
he
might
find
news
to
confirm
his
persisting
unbelief
in
any
such
rashness
as
was
alleged
on
monmouth
part
so
blake
was
forced
to
wait
but
his
purpose
suffered
nothing
by
delay
returning
on
the
morrow
he
found
wilding
at
table
with
nick
trenchard
and
he
cut
short
the
greetings
of
both
men
he
flung
his
hat
a
black
castor
trimmed
with
a
black
feather
rudely
among
the
dishes
on
the
board
i
have
come
to
ask
you
wilding
said
he
to
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
the
colour
of
that
wilding
raised
one
eyebrow
and
looked
aslant
at
trenchard
whose
face
was
suddenly
agrin
with
stupefaction
i
could
not
said
wilding
deny
an
answer
to
a
question
set
so
he
looked
up
into
blake
flushed
and
scowling
face
with
the
sweetest
and
most
innocent
of
smiles
you
no
doubt
disagree
with
me
said
he
but
i
love
to
meet
a
man
halfway
your
hat
sir
is
as
white
as
virgin
blake
slow
wits
were
disconcerted
for
a
moment
then
he
smiled
viciously
you
mistake
wilding
said
he
my
hat
is
wilding
looked
more
attentively
at
the
object
in
dispute
he
was
in
a
trifling
mood
and
the
stupidity
of
this
runagate
debtor
afforded
him
opportunities
to
indulge
it
why
true
said
he
now
that
i
come
to
look
i
perceive
that
it
is
indeed
and
again
was
sir
rowland
disconcerted
still
he
pursued
the
lesson
he
had
taught
himself
you
are
mistaken
again
said
he
that
hat
is
indeed
quoth
wilding
like
one
surprised
and
he
turned
to
trenchard
who
was
enjoying
himself
what
is
your
own
opinion
of
it
nick
thus
appealed
to
trenchard
reply
was
prompt
why
since
you
ask
me
said
he
my
opinion
is
that
it
a
noisome
thing
not
meet
for
a
gentleman
and
he
took
it
up
and
threw
it
through
the
window
sir
rowland
was
entirely
put
out
of
countenance
here
was
a
deliberate
shifting
of
the
quarrel
he
had
come
to
pick
which
left
him
all
at
sea
it
was
his
duty
to
himself
to
take
offence
at
trenchard
action
but
that
was
not
the
business
on
which
he
had
come
he
became
angry
blister
me
he
cried
must
i
sweep
the
cloth
from
the
table
before
you
understand
me
if
you
were
to
do
anything
so
unmannerly
i
should
have
you
flung
out
of
the
house
said
wilding
and
it
would
distress
me
so
to
treat
a
person
of
your
station
and
quality
the
hat
shall
serve
your
purpose
although
trenchard
concern
for
my
table
has
removed
it
our
memories
will
supply
its
absence
what
colour
did
you
say
it
was
i
said
it
was
green
answered
blake
quite
ready
to
keep
to
the
point
nay
i
am
sure
you
were
wrong
said
wilding
with
a
grave
air
although
i
admit
that
since
it
is
your
own
hat
you
should
be
the
best
judge
of
its
colour
i
am
nevertheless
of
opinion
that
it
is
and
if
i
were
to
say
that
it
is
white
asked
blake
feeling
mighty
ridiculous
why
in
that
case
you
would
be
confirming
my
first
impression
of
it
answered
wilding
and
trenchard
let
fly
a
burst
of
laughter
at
sight
of
the
baronet
furious
and
bewildered
countenance
and
since
we
are
agreed
on
that
continued
wilding
imperturbable
i
hope
join
us
at
i
be
damned
roared
blake
if
ever
i
sit
at
table
of
yours
ah
said
wilding
regretfully
now
you
become
i
mean
to
be
said
blake
you
astonish
me
you
lie
i
do
sir
rowland
answered
him
in
triumph
he
had
got
it
out
at
last
wilding
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
him
his
face
inexpressibly
shocked
will
you
of
your
own
accord
deprive
us
of
your
company
sir
rowland
he
wondered
or
shall
trenchard
throw
you
after
your
hat
do
you
mean
gasped
the
other
that
you
ask
no
satisfaction
of
me
not
so
trenchard
shall
wait
upon
your
friends
and
i
hope
you
afford
us
then
as
felicitous
entertainment
as
you
do
sir
rowland
snorted
and
turning
on
his
heel
made
for
the
door
give
you
a
good
night
sir
rowland
wilding
called
after
him
walters
you
rascal
light
sir
rowland
to
the
poor
blake
went
home
deeply
vexed
but
it
was
no
more
than
the
beginning
of
his
humiliation
at
wilding
hands
for
what
can
be
more
humiliating
to
a
quarrel
seeking
man
than
to
have
his
enemy
refuse
to
treat
him
seriously
he
and
wilding
met
next
morning
and
before
noon
the
tale
of
it
had
run
through
bridgwater
that
wild
wilding
was
at
his
tricks
again
it
made
a
pretty
story
how
twice
he
had
disarmed
and
each
time
spared
the
london
beau
who
still
insisted
each
time
more
furiously
upon
renewing
the
encounter
till
wilding
had
been
forced
to
run
him
through
the
and
thus
put
him
out
of
all
case
of
continuing
it
was
a
story
that
heaped
ridicule
upon
sir
rowland
and
did
credit
to
wilding
richard
heard
it
and
trembled
enraged
and
impotent
ruth
heard
it
and
was
stirred
despite
herself
to
a
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
wilding
for
the
patience
and
toleration
he
had
displayed
there
for
a
while
the
matter
rested
and
the
days
passed
slowly
but
sir
rowland
nature
mean
at
bottom
was
spurred
to
find
him
some
other
way
of
wiping
out
the
score
that
lay
him
and
wilding
a
score
mightily
increased
by
the
shame
that
wilding
had
put
upon
him
in
that
encounter
from
which
whatever
the
issue
he
had
looked
to
cull
great
credit
in
ruth
eyes
he
had
been
thinking
constantly
of
the
incautious
words
that
richard
had
let
fall
thinking
of
them
in
conjunction
with
the
startling
rumours
that
were
now
the
talk
of
the
whole
countryside
he
laid
two
and
two
together
and
the
four
he
found
them
make
afforded
him
some
hope
then
he
realized
as
he
might
have
realized
before
had
he
been
shrewder
that
richard
mood
was
one
that
made
him
ripe
for
any
villainy
he
thought
that
he
was
much
in
error
if
a
treachery
existed
so
black
that
richard
would
quail
before
it
if
it
but
afforded
him
the
means
of
ridding
himself
and
the
world
of
wilding
he
was
considering
how
best
to
approach
the
subject
when
it
happened
that
one
night
when
richard
sat
at
play
with
him
in
his
own
lodging
the
boy
grew
talkative
through
excess
of
wine
it
happened
naturally
enough
that
richard
sought
an
ally
in
blake
just
as
blake
sought
an
ally
in
richard
indeed
their
fortunes
so
far
as
ruth
was
concerned
were
bound
up
together
the
baronet
saw
that
richard
was
ripe
for
any
confidences
that
might
aim
at
the
destruction
of
his
enemy
he
questioned
him
adroitly
and
drew
from
him
the
story
of
the
rising
that
was
being
planned
and
of
the
share
that
wilding
one
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
chief
bore
in
the
business
that
was
toward
when
towards
midnight
richard
westmacott
went
home
he
left
in
sir
rowland
hands
an
instrument
which
the
latter
accounted
potential
not
only
for
the
destruction
of
anthony
wilding
but
perhaps
also
for
laying
the
foundations
to
the
building
of
his
own
fortunes
anew
chapter
vii
the
nuptials
of
ruth
westmacott
here
was
sir
rowland
blake
in
high
fettle
at
knowing
himself
armed
with
a
portentous
weapon
for
the
destruction
of
anthony
wilding
upon
closer
inspection
of
it
however
he
came
to
realize
as
richard
had
realized
earlier
that
it
was
and
that
the
wielding
of
it
must
be
fraught
with
as
much
danger
for
richard
as
for
their
common
enemy
for
to
betray
wilding
and
the
plot
would
scarce
be
possible
without
betraying
young
westmacott
and
that
was
unthinkable
since
to
ruin
richard
a
thing
he
would
have
done
with
a
light
heart
so
far
as
richard
was
himself
concerned
would
be
to
ruin
his
own
hopes
of
winning
ruth
therefore
during
the
days
that
followed
sir
rowland
was
forced
to
fret
in
idleness
what
time
his
wound
was
healing
but
if
his
arm
was
invalided
his
eyes
and
ears
were
sound
and
he
remained
watchful
for
an
opportunity
to
apply
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
richard
mentioned
the
subject
no
more
so
that
blake
almost
came
to
wonder
whether
the
boy
remembered
what
in
his
cups
he
had
betrayed
meanwhile
wilding
moved
serene
and
smiling
on
his
way
daily
there
were
great
armfuls
of
flowers
deposited
at
lupton
house
his
offering
to
his
mistress
and
no
day
went
by
but
that
some
richer
gift
accompanied
them
now
it
was
a
collar
of
brilliants
anon
a
rope
of
pearls
again
a
priceless
ring
that
had
been
wilding
mother
ruth
received
with
reluctance
these
pledges
of
his
undesired
affection
it
were
idle
to
reject
them
considering
that
she
was
to
marry
him
yet
it
hurt
her
sorely
to
retain
them
on
her
side
she
made
no
dispositions
for
the
marriage
but
went
about
her
daily
tasks
as
though
she
were
to
remain
a
maid
at
lupton
house
for
a
time
as
yet
indefinite
in
diana
wilding
had
though
he
was
far
from
guessing
it
an
entirely
exceptional
ally
lady
horton
too
was
favourably
disposed
towards
him
a
foolish
worldly
woman
who
never
probed
beneath
life
surface
nor
indeed
dreamed
that
anything
existed
in
life
beyond
that
to
which
her
five
senses
testified
she
was
content
placidly
to
contemplate
the
advantages
that
must
accrue
to
her
niece
from
this
alliance
and
so
mother
and
daughter
in
wilding
absence
pleaded
his
cause
with
his
refractory
but
they
pleaded
it
to
little
real
purpose
something
perhaps
they
achieved
in
that
ruth
grew
more
or
less
resigned
to
the
fate
that
awaited
her
by
repeating
to
herself
the
arguments
she
had
employed
to
richard
that
she
must
wed
some
day
and
that
wilding
would
prove
no
doubt
as
good
a
husband
as
another
she
came
in
a
measure
to
believe
them
richard
meanwhile
appeared
to
avoid
her
lacking
the
courage
to
adopt
the
heroic
measures
which
at
first
he
had
promised
yet
had
he
grace
enough
to
take
shame
at
his
inaction
but
if
he
was
idle
so
far
as
wilding
was
concerned
there
was
no
lack
of
work
for
him
in
other
connections
the
clouds
of
war
were
gathering
in
that
summer
sky
and
about
to
loose
the
storm
gestating
in
them
upon
that
fair
country
of
the
west
and
young
westmacott
committed
as
he
stood
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
party
was
forced
to
take
his
share
in
the
surreptitious
bustle
that
was
toward
he
was
away
two
days
in
that
week
having
been
summoned
to
a
meeting
of
the
leading
gentlemen
of
the
party
at
white
lackington
where
he
was
forced
into
the
unwelcome
company
of
his
future
to
meet
with
courteous
deferential
treatment
from
that
imperturbable
gentleman
wilding
indeed
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
any
quarrel
had
ever
existed
between
them
for
the
rest
he
came
and
went
supremely
calm
as
if
he
were
and
knew
himself
to
be
most
welcome
at
lupton
house
thrice
in
the
course
of
that
week
of
waiting
he
rode
over
from
zoyland
chase
to
pay
his
duty
to
mistress
westmacott
and
ruth
was
persuaded
on
each
occasion
by
her
aunt
and
cousin
to
receive
him
indeed
how
could
she
well
refuse
his
manner
was
ever
all
that
could
be
desired
gallant
affectionate
deferential
he
was
in
word
and
look
and
tone
ruth
most
obedient
servant
had
she
been
less
prejudiced
she
must
have
admired
the
admirable
restraint
with
which
he
kept
all
exultation
from
his
manner
for
after
all
it
is
difficult
to
force
a
victory
as
he
had
forced
his
and
not
to
triumph
it
is
to
be
feared
that
during
that
week
he
neglected
a
good
deal
of
his
duty
to
the
duke
leaving
trenchard
to
supply
his
place
and
undertake
tasks
of
a
seditious
nature
that
should
have
been
his
own
at
heart
however
in
spite
of
the
stories
current
and
the
militia
at
taunton
wilding
remained
convinced
as
did
most
of
the
other
leading
partisans
of
the
protestant
cause
that
no
such
madness
as
this
premature
landing
could
be
in
contemplation
by
the
duke
besides
were
it
so
they
must
unfailingly
have
definite
word
of
it
and
they
had
none
trenchard
was
less
assured
but
wilding
laughed
at
the
old
forebodings
and
serenely
went
about
the
business
of
his
marriage
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
he
paid
ruth
his
last
visit
in
the
quality
of
a
lover
and
was
received
by
her
in
the
garden
he
found
her
looking
paler
than
her
wont
and
there
was
a
cloud
of
sadness
on
her
brow
a
haunting
sadness
in
her
eyes
it
touched
him
to
the
soul
and
for
a
moment
he
wavered
in
his
purpose
he
stood
beside
her
she
seated
on
the
old
lichened
seat
and
a
silence
fell
between
them
during
which
wilding
conscience
wrestled
with
his
stronger
passion
it
was
his
habit
to
be
glib
talking
incessantly
what
time
he
was
in
her
company
and
seeing
to
it
that
his
talk
was
shallow
and
touched
at
nothing
belonging
to
the
deeps
of
human
life
thus
was
it
perhaps
that
this
sudden
and
enduring
silence
affected
her
most
oddly
it
was
as
if
she
had
absorbed
some
notion
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
she
looked
up
suddenly
into
his
face
so
white
and
so
composed
their
eyes
met
and
he
stooped
to
her
suddenly
his
long
brown
ringlets
tumbling
forward
she
feared
his
kiss
yet
never
moved
staring
up
with
fixed
dilated
eyes
as
if
fascinated
by
his
dark
brooding
gaze
he
paused
hovering
above
her
upturned
face
as
hovers
the
hawk
above
the
dove
child
he
said
at
last
and
his
voice
was
soft
and
winning
from
very
sadness
child
why
do
you
fear
me
the
truth
of
it
went
home
to
her
she
feared
him
she
feared
the
strength
that
lay
behind
that
calm
she
feared
the
masterfulness
of
his
wild
but
inscrutably
hidden
nature
she
was
afraid
to
surrender
to
such
a
man
as
this
afraid
that
in
the
hot
crucible
of
his
love
her
own
nature
would
be
dissolved
transmuted
and
rendered
part
of
his
yet
though
the
truth
was
now
made
plain
to
her
she
thrust
it
from
her
i
do
not
fear
you
said
she
and
her
voice
at
least
rang
fearlessly
do
you
hate
me
then
he
asked
her
glance
grew
troubled
and
fell
away
from
his
it
sought
the
calm
of
the
river
gleaming
golden
in
the
sunset
there
was
a
pause
wilding
sighed
heavily
and
straightened
himself
from
his
bending
posture
you
should
not
have
sought
thus
to
compel
me
she
said
presently
i
own
it
he
answered
a
thought
bitterly
i
own
it
yet
what
hope
had
i
but
in
compulsion
she
returned
him
no
answer
you
see
he
said
with
increasing
bitterness
you
see
that
had
i
not
seized
the
chance
that
was
mine
to
win
you
by
compulsion
i
had
not
won
you
at
it
might
said
she
have
been
better
so
for
both
of
better
for
neither
he
replied
ah
think
it
not
in
time
i
swear
you
shall
not
think
it
for
you
shall
come
to
love
me
ruth
he
added
with
a
note
of
such
assurance
that
she
turned
to
meet
again
his
gaze
he
answered
the
wordless
question
of
her
eyes
there
is
said
he
no
love
of
man
for
woman
so
that
the
man
be
not
wholly
unworthy
so
that
his
passion
be
sincere
and
strong
that
can
fail
in
time
to
arouse
she
smiled
a
little
pitiful
smile
of
unbelief
were
i
a
boy
he
rejoined
his
earnestness
vibrating
now
in
a
voice
that
was
usually
so
calm
and
level
offering
you
protestations
of
a
callow
worship
you
might
have
cause
to
doubt
me
but
i
am
a
man
ruth
a
tried
and
haply
a
sinful
man
alas
a
man
who
needs
you
and
who
will
have
you
at
all
at
all
costs
she
echoed
and
her
lip
took
on
a
curl
and
you
call
this
egotism
by
the
name
of
love
no
doubt
you
are
right
she
continued
with
an
irony
that
stung
him
for
love
it
is
love
of
and
is
not
all
love
of
another
founded
upon
the
love
of
self
he
asked
her
startling
her
with
a
question
that
revealed
to
her
mind
a
truth
undreamed
of
when
some
day
please
heaven
i
come
to
find
favour
in
your
eyes
and
you
come
to
love
me
what
will
it
mean
but
that
you
have
come
to
find
me
necessary
to
yourself
and
to
your
happiness
would
you
deny
me
now
your
love
if
you
felt
that
you
had
need
of
mine
i
love
you
because
i
love
myself
you
say
i
grant
it
you
but
confess
that
if
you
do
not
love
me
yet
it
is
for
the
same
reason
and
that
when
you
do
come
to
love
me
the
reason
will
be
still
the
you
are
very
sure
that
i
shall
come
to
love
you
said
she
shifting
the
ground
of
argument
now
that
she
found
insecure
the
place
on
which
at
first
she
had
taken
her
stand
were
i
not
think
you
i
should
compel
you
to
the
church
she
trembled
at
his
calm
assurance
it
was
as
if
she
almost
feared
that
what
he
said
might
come
to
pass
since
you
bear
such
faith
in
your
heart
said
she
were
it
not
nobler
more
generous
that
you
should
set
yourself
to
win
me
first
and
wed
me
afterwards
it
is
the
course
i
should
myself
prefer
he
answered
quietly
but
it
is
a
course
denied
me
i
was
viewed
here
with
disfavour
almost
denied
your
house
what
chance
had
i
whilst
i
might
not
come
near
you
whilst
your
mind
was
poisoned
against
me
by
the
idle
vicious
prattle
that
goes
round
and
round
the
countryside
increasing
ever
in
bulk
from
constant
repetition
do
you
say
that
these
tales
are
groundless
she
asked
with
a
sudden
lifting
of
the
eyes
a
sudden
keen
eagerness
that
did
not
escape
him
i
would
to
god
i
could
he
cried
since
from
your
manner
i
see
that
would
improve
me
in
your
sight
but
there
is
just
sufficient
truth
in
them
to
forbid
me
as
i
am
i
hope
a
gentleman
from
giving
them
a
full
denial
yet
in
what
am
i
worse
than
my
fellows
are
you
of
those
who
think
a
husband
should
come
to
them
as
one
whose
youth
has
been
the
youth
of
cloistered
nun
heaven
knows
i
am
not
one
to
draw
parallels
myself
and
any
other
yet
you
compel
me
whilst
you
deny
me
you
receive
this
fellow
blake
a
london
a
broken
gamester
who
has
given
his
creditors
and
who
woos
you
that
with
your
fortune
he
may
close
the
doors
of
the
debtor
gaol
that
open
to
receive
this
is
unworthy
in
you
she
exclaimed
her
tone
indignant
so
indignant
that
he
experienced
his
first
pang
of
jealousy
it
would
be
were
i
his
rival
he
answered
quietly
but
i
am
not
i
have
saved
you
from
becoming
the
prey
of
such
as
he
by
forcing
you
to
marry
that
i
may
become
the
prey
of
such
as
you
instead
was
her
retort
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
smiling
sadly
then
with
pardonable
when
we
think
of
what
manner
of
man
it
was
with
whom
he
now
compared
himself
surely
said
he
it
is
better
to
become
the
prey
of
the
lion
than
the
to
the
victim
it
can
matter
little
she
answered
and
he
saw
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
compassion
moved
him
it
rose
in
arms
to
batter
down
his
will
and
in
a
weaker
man
had
triumphed
wilding
bent
his
knee
and
went
down
beside
her
i
swear
he
said
impassionedly
that
as
my
wife
you
shall
never
count
yourself
a
victim
you
shall
be
honoured
by
all
men
but
by
none
more
deeply
than
by
him
who
will
ever
strive
to
be
worthy
of
the
proud
title
of
your
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
reverentially
he
rose
and
looked
at
her
he
said
and
bowing
low
before
her
went
his
way
leaving
her
with
emotions
that
found
their
vent
in
tears
but
defied
her
maiden
mind
to
understand
them
the
morrow
came
her
a
sunny
day
of
early
june
and
ruth
assisted
by
diana
and
lady
horton
made
preparation
for
her
marriage
as
spirited
women
have
made
preparation
for
the
scaffold
determined
to
show
the
world
a
brave
serene
exterior
the
sacrifice
was
necessary
for
richard
sake
that
was
a
thing
long
since
determined
yet
it
would
have
been
some
comfort
to
her
to
have
had
richard
at
her
side
it
would
have
lent
her
strength
to
have
had
his
kiss
of
thanks
for
the
holocaust
which
for
him
she
was
making
of
all
that
a
woman
holds
most
dear
and
sacred
but
richard
was
away
he
had
been
absent
since
yesterday
and
none
could
tell
her
where
he
tarried
with
lady
horton
and
diana
she
took
her
way
to
saint
mary
church
at
noon
and
there
she
found
wilding
very
fine
in
a
suit
of
satin
laced
with
silver
awaiting
her
and
with
him
was
old
lord
gervase
scoresby
his
friend
and
cousin
the
very
incarnation
of
benignity
and
ruddy
health
for
a
wonder
nick
trenchard
was
not
at
wilding
side
but
nick
had
definitely
refused
to
be
of
the
party
emphasizing
his
refusal
by
certain
choice
reflections
wholly
unflattering
to
the
married
state
some
idlers
of
the
town
were
the
only
witnesses
and
little
did
they
guess
the
extent
of
the
tragedy
they
were
witnessing
there
was
no
music
and
the
ceremony
was
brief
and
soon
at
an
end
the
only
touch
of
joy
of
festiveness
was
that
afforded
by
the
choice
blooms
with
which
wilding
had
smothered
nave
and
choir
and
their
perfume
hung
heavy
as
incense
in
the
temple
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
droned
the
voice
and
wilding
smiled
defiantly
a
smile
which
seemed
to
answer
him
no
man
i
have
taken
her
for
lord
gervase
stood
forward
as
her
sponsor
and
as
in
a
dream
ruth
felt
her
hand
lying
in
wilding
cool
firm
grasp
the
ecclesiastic
voice
droned
on
his
voice
hanging
like
the
hum
of
some
great
insect
upon
the
scented
air
it
was
accomplished
and
they
were
welded
each
to
the
other
until
death
should
part
them
down
the
festooned
nave
she
came
on
his
arm
her
step
unfaltering
her
face
calm
black
misery
in
her
heart
behind
followed
her
aunt
and
cousin
and
lord
gervase
on
wilding
aquiline
face
a
pale
smile
glimmered
like
a
beam
of
moonlight
upon
tranquil
waters
and
it
abode
there
until
they
reached
the
porch
and
were
suddenly
confronted
by
nick
trenchard
red
of
face
for
once
perspiring
excited
and
from
head
to
foot
he
had
arrived
that
very
instant
and
urged
by
the
fearful
news
that
brought
him
he
had
come
resolved
to
pluck
wilding
from
the
altar
be
the
ceremony
done
or
not
but
in
that
he
reckoned
without
wilding
for
he
should
have
known
him
better
than
to
have
hoped
to
succeed
he
stepped
forward
now
and
gripped
him
with
his
dusty
glove
by
the
sleeve
of
his
shimmering
bridegroom
coat
his
voice
came
harsh
with
excitement
and
smouldering
rage
a
word
with
you
anthony
wilding
turned
placidly
to
regard
him
what
now
he
asked
his
bride
hand
retained
in
the
crook
of
his
elbow
treachery
snapped
trenchard
in
a
whisper
hell
and
damnation
step
aside
wilding
turned
to
lord
gervase
and
begged
of
him
to
take
charge
of
mistress
wilding
i
deplore
this
interruption
he
told
her
no
whit
ruffled
by
what
he
had
heard
but
i
shall
rejoin
you
soon
meanwhile
his
lordship
will
do
the
honours
for
this
last
he
said
with
his
eyes
moving
to
lady
horton
and
her
daughter
lord
gervase
in
some
surprise
but
overruled
by
his
cousin
calm
took
the
bride
on
his
arm
and
led
her
from
the
churchyard
to
the
waiting
carriage
to
this
he
handed
her
and
after
her
her
aunt
and
cousin
then
mounting
himself
they
drove
away
leaving
wilding
and
trenchard
among
the
tombstones
whither
the
messenger
of
evil
had
meanwhile
led
his
friend
trenchard
rapped
out
his
story
briefly
shenke
said
he
who
was
riding
from
lyme
with
letters
for
you
from
the
duke
was
robbed
of
his
dispatches
late
last
night
a
mile
or
so
this
side
highwaymen
inquired
wilding
his
tone
calm
though
his
glance
had
hardened
highwaymen
no
government
agents
belike
there
were
two
of
them
he
says
for
i
have
the
tale
from
himself
and
they
met
him
at
the
hare
and
hounds
at
taunton
where
he
stayed
to
sup
last
night
one
of
them
gave
him
the
password
and
he
conceived
him
to
be
a
friend
but
afterwards
growing
suspicious
he
refused
to
tell
them
too
much
they
followed
him
it
appears
and
on
the
road
they
overtook
and
fell
upon
him
they
knocked
him
from
his
horse
possessed
themselves
of
the
contents
of
his
wallet
and
left
him
for
dead
with
his
head
wilding
drew
a
sharp
breath
his
wits
worked
quickly
he
was
he
realized
in
deadly
peril
one
thought
he
gave
to
ruth
if
the
worst
came
to
pass
here
was
one
who
would
rejoice
in
her
freedom
the
reflection
cut
through
him
like
a
sword
he
would
be
loath
to
die
until
he
had
taught
her
to
regret
him
then
his
mind
returned
to
what
trenchard
had
told
him
you
said
a
government
agent
he
mused
slowly
how
would
a
government
agent
know
the
password
trenchard
mouth
fell
open
i
had
not
thought
he
began
then
ended
with
an
oath
is
a
traitor
from
wilding
nodded
it
must
be
one
of
those
who
met
at
white
lackington
three
nights
ago
he
answered
idlers
the
witnesses
of
the
wedding
were
watching
them
with
interest
from
the
path
and
others
from
over
the
low
wall
of
the
churchyard
as
well
they
might
for
wilding
behaviour
was
for
a
bridegroom
extraordinary
trenchard
did
not
relish
the
audience
we
had
best
away
said
he
indeed
he
added
we
had
best
out
of
england
altogether
before
the
hue
and
cry
is
raised
the
wilding
hand
fell
on
his
arm
and
its
grasp
was
steady
wilding
eyes
met
his
and
their
gaze
was
calm
where
have
you
bestowed
this
messenger
quoth
he
he
is
here
in
bridgwater
in
bed
at
the
bell
inn
whence
he
sent
for
you
to
zoyland
chase
suspecting
trouble
i
rode
to
him
at
once
come
then
said
wilding
we
go
talk
with
him
this
matter
needs
probing
ere
we
decide
on
flight
you
do
not
seem
to
have
sought
to
discover
who
were
the
thieves
nor
other
matters
that
it
may
be
of
use
to
rat
me
swore
trenchard
i
was
in
haste
to
bring
you
news
of
it
besides
there
were
other
things
to
talk
of
there
is
news
that
albemarle
has
gone
to
exeter
and
that
sir
edward
phelips
and
colonel
luttrell
have
been
ordered
to
taunton
by
the
wilding
stared
at
him
with
sudden
dismay
odso
he
exclaimed
is
king
james
taking
fright
at
last
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
pshaw
he
cried
they
are
starting
at
a
heaven
send
prayed
trenchard
that
the
shadow
does
not
prove
to
have
a
substance
immediately
behind
folly
said
wilding
when
monmouth
comes
indeed
we
shall
not
lack
forewarning
come
he
added
briskly
we
see
this
messenger
and
endeavour
to
discover
who
were
these
fellows
that
beset
and
he
drew
trenchard
from
among
the
tombstones
to
the
open
path
and
thus
from
the
churchyard
and
the
eyes
of
the
gaping
onlookers
chapter
viii
bride
and
groom
and
so
the
bridegroom
in
all
his
wedding
finery
made
his
way
with
trenchard
to
the
bell
inn
in
the
high
street
whilst
his
bride
escorted
by
lord
gervase
was
being
driven
to
zoyland
chase
of
which
she
was
now
the
mistress
but
she
was
not
destined
just
yet
to
cross
its
threshold
for
scarcely
were
they
over
the
river
when
a
horseman
barred
their
way
and
called
upon
the
driver
to
pull
up
lady
horton
in
a
panic
huddled
herself
in
the
great
coach
and
spoke
of
tobymen
whilst
lord
gervase
thrust
his
head
from
the
window
to
discover
that
the
rider
who
stayed
their
progress
was
richard
westmacott
his
lordship
hailed
the
boy
who
thereupon
walked
his
horse
to
the
carriage
door
lord
gervase
said
he
will
you
bid
the
coachman
put
about
and
drive
to
lupton
house
lord
gervase
stared
at
him
in
hopeless
bewilderment
drive
to
lupton
house
he
echoed
the
more
he
saw
of
this
odd
wedding
the
less
he
understood
of
it
it
seemed
to
the
placid
old
gentleman
that
he
was
fallen
among
a
parcel
of
bedlamites
surely
sir
it
is
for
mistress
wilding
to
say
whither
she
will
be
driven
and
he
drew
in
his
head
and
turned
to
ruth
for
her
commands
but
bewildered
herself
she
had
none
to
give
him
it
was
her
turn
to
lean
from
the
carriage
window
to
ask
her
brother
what
he
meant
i
mean
you
are
to
drive
home
again
said
he
there
is
something
i
must
tell
you
when
you
have
heard
me
it
shall
be
yours
to
decide
whether
you
will
proceed
or
not
to
zoyland
hers
to
decide
how
was
that
possible
what
could
he
mean
she
pressed
him
with
some
such
questions
it
means
in
short
he
answered
impatiently
that
i
hold
your
salvation
in
my
hands
for
the
rest
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
to
tell
you
more
bid
the
fellow
put
ruth
sat
back
and
looked
once
more
at
her
companions
but
from
none
did
she
receive
the
least
helpful
suggestion
lady
horton
made
great
prattle
to
little
purpose
lord
gervase
followed
her
example
whilst
diana
whose
alert
if
trivial
mind
was
the
one
that
might
have
offered
assistance
sat
silent
ruth
pondered
she
bethought
her
of
sudden
arrival
at
saint
mary
his
person
and
excited
manner
and
of
how
he
had
drawn
wilding
aside
with
news
that
seemed
of
moment
and
now
her
brother
spoke
of
saving
her
it
was
a
little
late
for
that
she
thought
outside
the
coach
his
voice
still
urged
her
and
it
grew
peevish
and
angry
as
was
usual
when
he
was
crossed
in
the
end
she
consented
to
do
his
will
if
she
were
to
fathom
this
mystery
that
was
thickening
about
her
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
course
she
turned
to
lord
gervase
will
you
do
as
richard
says
she
begged
him
his
lordship
blew
out
his
chubby
cheeks
in
his
astonishment
he
hesitated
a
moment
thinking
of
his
cousin
wilding
then
with
a
shrug
he
leaned
from
the
window
and
gave
the
order
she
desired
the
carriage
turned
about
and
with
richard
following
lumbered
back
across
the
bridge
and
through
the
town
to
lupton
house
at
the
door
lord
gervase
took
his
leave
of
them
he
had
acted
as
ruth
had
bidden
him
but
he
had
no
wish
to
be
further
involved
in
this
affair
whatever
it
might
portend
rather
was
it
his
duty
at
once
to
go
acquaint
wilding
if
he
could
find
him
with
what
was
taking
place
and
leave
it
to
wilding
to
take
what
measures
might
seem
best
to
him
he
told
them
so
and
having
told
them
left
them
richard
begged
to
be
alone
with
his
sister
and
alone
they
passed
together
into
the
library
his
manner
was
restless
he
trembled
with
excitement
and
his
eyes
glittered
almost
feverishly
you
may
have
thought
ruth
that
i
was
resigned
to
your
marriage
with
this
fellow
wilding
he
began
or
that
for
other
reasons
i
thought
it
wiser
not
to
interfere
if
you
thought
that
you
wronged
me
i
blake
and
i
have
been
at
work
for
you
during
these
last
days
and
i
rejoice
to
say
our
labours
have
not
been
his
manner
grew
assertive
boastful
as
he
proceeded
you
know
of
course
said
she
that
i
am
he
made
a
gesture
of
disdain
no
matter
said
he
exultantly
it
matters
something
i
think
she
answered
o
richard
richard
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
sooner
if
you
possessed
the
means
of
sparing
me
this
thing
he
shrugged
impatiently
her
remonstrance
seemed
to
throw
him
out
of
temper
oons
he
cried
i
came
as
soon
as
was
ever
possible
and
depend
upon
it
i
am
not
come
too
late
indeed
i
think
i
am
come
in
the
very
nick
of
he
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
there
is
the
wherewithal
to
hang
your
fine
husband
he
announced
in
triumph
she
recoiled
to
hang
him
she
echoed
with
all
her
aversion
to
wilding
it
was
plain
she
did
not
wish
him
hanged
aye
to
hang
him
richard
repeated
and
drew
himself
to
the
full
height
of
his
short
stature
in
pride
at
the
thing
he
had
achieved
read
she
took
the
paper
almost
mechanically
and
for
some
moments
she
studied
the
crabbed
signature
before
realizing
whose
it
was
then
she
started
from
the
duke
of
monmouth
she
exclaimed
he
laughed
read
it
he
bade
her
again
though
there
was
no
need
for
the
injunction
for
already
she
was
deciphering
the
crabbed
hand
and
the
atrocious
spelling
for
his
grace
of
monmouth
education
had
been
notoriously
neglected
the
letter
which
was
dated
from
the
hague
was
addressed
to
my
good
friend
at
it
began
sir
spoke
of
the
imminent
arrival
of
his
grace
in
the
west
and
gave
certain
instructions
for
the
collection
of
arms
and
the
work
of
preparing
men
for
enlistment
in
his
cause
ending
with
protestations
of
his
friendship
and
esteem
ruth
read
the
epistle
twice
before
its
treasonable
nature
was
made
clear
to
her
before
she
understood
the
thing
that
was
foreshadowed
then
she
raised
troubled
eyes
to
her
brother
face
and
in
answer
to
the
question
of
her
glance
he
made
clear
to
her
the
shrewd
means
by
which
they
had
become
possessed
of
this
weapon
that
should
destroy
their
enemy
wilding
blake
and
he
forewarned
he
said
not
how
of
the
coming
of
this
messenger
had
lain
in
wait
for
him
at
the
hare
and
hounds
at
taunton
they
had
sought
at
first
to
become
possessed
of
the
letter
without
violence
but
having
failed
in
this
through
having
aroused
the
messenger
suspicions
they
had
been
forced
to
follow
and
attack
him
on
a
lonely
stretch
of
road
where
they
had
robbed
him
of
the
contents
of
his
wallet
richard
added
that
the
letter
was
no
doubt
one
of
several
sent
over
by
monmouth
to
some
friend
at
lyme
for
distribution
among
his
principal
agents
in
the
west
it
was
regrettable
that
they
should
have
endeavoured
to
take
gentle
measures
with
the
courier
as
this
had
forewarned
him
and
he
had
apparently
been
led
to
remove
the
letter
outer
wrapper
which
no
doubt
bore
wilding
full
name
and
address
against
the
chance
of
such
an
attack
as
they
had
made
upon
him
nevertheless
as
it
was
that
letter
to
my
good
friend
backed
by
richard
and
blake
evidence
of
the
destination
intended
for
it
would
be
more
than
enough
to
lay
wilding
safely
by
the
heels
i
would
to
heaven
he
repeated
in
conclusion
i
could
have
come
in
time
to
save
you
from
becoming
his
wife
but
at
least
it
is
in
my
power
to
make
you
very
speedily
his
that
said
ruth
still
retaining
the
letter
is
what
you
propose
to
do
what
else
she
shook
her
head
it
must
not
be
richard
she
said
i
not
consent
to
taken
aback
he
stared
at
her
then
laughed
unpleasantly
odds
my
life
are
you
in
love
with
the
man
have
you
been
fooling
us
no
she
answered
but
i
be
no
party
to
his
murder
quotha
who
talks
of
murder
her
shrewd
eyes
searched
his
face
how
came
you
by
your
knowledge
that
this
courier
rode
to
wilding
she
asked
him
suddenly
and
the
swift
change
that
overspread
his
countenance
showed
her
that
she
had
touched
him
in
a
tender
spot
assured
her
of
the
thing
she
had
suddenly
come
to
suspect
a
suspicion
which
at
the
same
time
started
from
and
explained
much
that
had
been
mysterious
in
richard
ways
of
late
you
had
knowledge
of
this
conspiracy
she
pursued
answering
her
own
question
before
he
had
time
to
speak
because
you
were
one
of
the
at
least
i
am
so
no
longer
he
blurted
out
i
thank
heaven
for
that
richard
for
your
life
is
very
dear
to
me
but
it
would
ill
become
you
to
make
such
use
as
this
of
the
knowledge
you
came
by
in
that
manner
it
were
a
judas
he
would
have
interrupted
her
but
her
manner
dominated
him
you
will
leave
this
letter
with
me
richard
she
continued
damn
me
no
he
began
ah
yes
richard
she
insisted
you
will
give
it
to
me
and
i
shall
thank
you
for
the
gift
it
shall
prove
a
weapon
for
my
salvation
never
it
shall
indeed
he
cried
with
an
ugly
laugh
when
i
have
ridden
to
exeter
to
lay
it
before
not
so
she
answered
him
it
shall
be
a
weapon
of
defence
not
of
offence
it
shall
stand
as
a
buckler
between
me
and
wilding
trust
me
i
shall
know
how
to
use
but
there
is
blake
to
consider
he
expostulated
growing
angry
i
am
pledged
to
your
first
duty
is
to
me
tut
he
interrupted
blake
feels
that
he
owes
it
to
his
loyalty
to
lay
this
letter
before
the
and
for
that
matter
so
do
sir
rowland
would
not
cross
my
wishes
in
this
she
answered
him
folly
he
cried
now
thoroughly
aroused
give
me
that
nay
richard
she
answered
and
waved
him
back
but
he
advanced
nevertheless
give
it
me
he
bade
her
waxing
fierce
gad
it
was
folly
to
have
told
you
of
it
i
had
not
done
so
but
that
i
never
thought
you
such
a
fool
as
to
oppose
yourself
to
the
thing
we
listen
richard
she
besought
him
but
he
was
grown
insensible
to
pleadings
give
me
that
letter
he
insisted
and
caught
her
wrist
her
other
hand
however
the
one
that
held
the
sheet
was
already
behind
her
back
the
door
was
suddenly
thrust
open
and
diana
appeared
ruth
she
announced
mr
wilding
is
at
the
mention
of
that
name
richard
let
her
free
wilding
he
ejaculated
his
fierceness
all
blown
out
of
him
he
had
imagined
that
already
wilding
would
be
in
full
flight
was
the
fellow
mad
he
is
following
me
said
diana
and
indeed
a
step
could
be
heard
in
the
passage
the
letter
growled
richard
in
a
frenzy
between
fear
and
anger
now
give
it
me
give
it
me
do
you
hear
sh
you
betray
yourself
she
cried
he
is
and
at
that
same
moment
wilding
tall
figure
still
arrayed
in
his
bridegroom
finery
of
satin
loomed
in
the
doorway
he
was
serene
and
calm
as
ever
neither
the
discovery
of
the
plot
by
the
abstraction
of
the
messenger
letter
nor
ruth
strange
conduct
of
which
he
had
heard
from
lord
gervase
had
sufficed
to
ruffle
outwardly
at
least
the
inscrutable
serenity
of
his
air
and
manner
he
paused
to
make
his
bow
then
advanced
into
the
room
with
a
passing
glance
at
richard
still
spurred
and
booted
and
all
you
appear
to
have
ridden
far
dick
said
he
smiling
and
richard
shivered
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
mocking
note
that
seemed
to
ring
faintly
at
the
words
i
saw
your
friend
sir
rowland
in
the
garden
he
added
i
think
he
waits
for
though
richard
could
not
fail
to
apprehend
the
implied
dismissal
he
was
minded
at
first
to
disregard
it
but
wilding
turning
held
the
door
addressing
diana
mistress
horton
said
he
will
you
give
us
leave
diana
curtsied
and
passed
out
and
wilding
eye
falling
upon
the
lingering
richard
at
that
moment
richard
thought
it
best
to
follow
her
example
but
he
went
with
rage
in
his
heart
at
being
forced
to
leave
that
precious
document
behind
him
as
wilding
his
back
to
her
a
moment
closed
the
door
ruth
slipped
the
paper
hurriedly
into
the
bosom
of
her
gown
he
turned
to
her
calm
but
very
grave
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
reproach
her
this
is
ill
done
ruth
said
he
ill
done
or
well
done
she
answered
him
done
it
is
and
shall
so
he
raised
his
brows
ah
said
he
i
appear
then
to
have
misapprehended
the
situation
from
what
gervase
told
me
i
understood
it
was
your
brother
forced
you
to
not
forced
sir
she
answered
him
induced
then
said
he
it
but
remains
me
to
induce
you
to
repair
what
i
think
was
a
she
shook
her
head
i
have
returned
home
for
good
said
she
you
pardon
me
said
he
that
i
am
so
egotistical
as
to
prefer
zoyland
chase
to
lupton
house
despite
the
manifold
attractions
of
the
latter
i
do
not
intend
to
take
up
my
abode
you
are
not
asked
what
then
she
hated
him
for
the
smile
for
his
masterful
air
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
humoured
her
because
he
scorned
to
use
authority
but
that
when
he
did
use
it
hers
must
it
be
to
obey
him
again
she
felt
that
everlasting
calm
arguing
such
latent
forces
was
the
thing
she
hated
most
in
him
i
think
i
had
best
be
plain
with
you
said
she
i
have
fulfilled
my
part
of
the
bargain
that
we
made
i
intend
to
do
no
more
i
promised
that
if
you
spared
my
brother
i
would
go
to
the
altar
with
you
i
have
carried
out
my
contract
to
the
letter
it
is
at
an
indeed
said
he
i
think
it
has
not
yet
he
advanced
towards
her
and
took
her
hand
she
yielded
it
unwilling
though
she
was
this
is
unworthy
of
you
madam
said
he
his
tone
grave
and
deferential
you
think
to
escape
fulfilling
the
spirit
of
your
bargain
by
adhering
to
the
letter
of
it
not
so
he
ended
and
shook
his
head
smiling
gently
the
carriage
is
still
at
your
door
you
return
with
me
to
zoyland
chase
to
take
possession
of
your
you
mistake
said
she
and
tore
her
hand
from
his
you
say
that
what
i
have
done
is
unworthy
i
admit
it
but
it
is
with
unworthiness
that
we
must
combat
unworthiness
was
your
attitude
towards
me
less
unworthy
i
make
amends
for
it
if
you
come
home
said
he
my
home
is
here
you
can
not
compel
i
should
be
loath
to
he
admitted
sighing
you
can
not
she
insisted
i
think
i
can
said
he
there
is
a
a
law
that
will
hang
you
if
you
invoke
it
she
cut
in
quickly
this
much
can
i
safely
promise
she
had
need
to
say
no
more
to
tell
him
everything
at
all
times
half
a
word
was
as
much
to
wilding
as
a
whole
sentence
to
another
she
saw
the
tightening
of
his
lips
the
hardening
of
his
eyes
beyond
which
he
gave
no
other
sign
that
she
had
hit
him
i
see
said
he
it
is
another
bargain
that
you
make
i
do
suspect
there
is
some
trader
blood
in
the
westmacott
veins
let
us
be
clear
you
hold
the
wherewithal
to
ruin
me
and
you
will
use
it
if
i
insist
upon
my
husband
rights
is
it
not
so
she
nodded
in
silence
surprised
at
the
rapidity
with
which
he
had
read
the
situation
i
admit
said
he
that
you
have
me
between
sword
and
he
laughed
shortly
let
me
know
more
he
begged
her
am
i
to
understand
that
so
long
as
i
leave
you
in
peace
so
long
as
i
do
not
insist
upon
your
becoming
my
wife
in
more
than
name
you
will
not
wield
the
weapon
that
you
hold
you
are
to
understand
so
she
answered
he
took
a
turn
in
the
room
very
thoughtful
not
of
himself
was
he
thinking
now
but
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
trenchard
had
told
him
some
ugly
truths
that
morning
of
how
in
his
he
appeared
to
have
shipwrecked
the
cause
ere
it
was
well
launched
if
this
letter
got
to
whitehall
there
was
no
gauging
ignorant
as
he
was
of
what
was
in
it
the
ruin
that
might
follow
but
they
had
reason
to
fear
the
worst
he
saw
his
duty
to
the
duke
most
clearly
and
he
breathed
a
prayer
of
thanks
that
richard
had
chosen
to
put
that
letter
to
such
a
use
as
this
he
knew
himself
checkmated
but
he
was
a
man
who
knew
how
to
bear
defeat
in
a
becoming
manner
he
turned
suddenly
the
letter
is
in
your
hands
he
inquired
it
is
she
answered
may
i
see
it
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
not
daring
to
show
it
or
betray
its
whereabouts
lest
he
should
use
force
to
become
possessed
of
it
a
thing
indeed
that
was
very
far
from
his
purpose
he
considered
a
moment
his
mind
intent
now
rather
upon
the
interest
than
his
own
you
know
quoth
he
the
desperate
enterprise
to
which
i
stand
committed
but
it
is
a
bargain
between
us
that
you
do
not
betray
me
nor
that
enterprise
so
long
as
i
leave
you
rid
of
my
that
is
the
bargain
i
propose
said
she
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
hungry
eyes
and
she
found
his
glance
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
so
strong
was
its
appeal
besides
it
may
be
that
she
was
a
thought
beglamoured
by
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
which
seemed
to
invest
him
with
a
certain
heroic
dignity
ruth
he
said
at
length
it
may
well
be
that
that
which
you
desire
may
speedily
come
to
pass
it
may
well
be
that
in
the
course
of
this
rebellion
that
is
hatching
you
may
be
widowed
but
at
least
i
know
that
if
my
head
falls
it
will
not
be
my
wife
who
has
betrayed
me
to
the
axe
for
that
much
believe
me
i
am
supremely
he
advanced
he
took
her
unresisting
hand
again
and
bore
it
to
his
lips
bowing
low
before
her
then
erect
and
graceful
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
her
chapter
ix
trenchard
counterstroke
now
however
much
it
might
satisfy
wilding
to
have
ruth
word
for
it
that
so
long
as
he
left
her
in
peace
neither
he
nor
the
cause
had
any
betrayal
to
fear
from
her
trenchard
was
of
a
very
different
mind
he
fumed
and
swore
and
worked
himself
into
a
very
passion
zoons
man
he
cried
it
would
mean
utter
ruin
to
you
if
that
letter
reached
i
realize
it
but
my
mind
is
easy
i
have
her
a
woman
promise
snorted
trenchard
and
proceeded
with
great
circumstance
of
expletives
to
damn
everything
that
daggled
a
your
fears
are
idle
wilding
assured
him
what
she
says
she
will
and
her
brother
quoth
trenchard
have
you
bethought
you
of
that
he
know
the
letter
whereabouts
he
has
cause
to
fear
you
more
than
ever
now
are
you
sure
he
not
be
making
use
of
it
to
lay
you
by
the
heels
wilding
smiled
upon
the
fury
provoked
by
trenchard
concern
and
love
for
him
she
has
promised
he
said
with
an
insistent
faith
that
was
fuel
to
trenchard
anger
and
i
can
depend
her
so
can
not
i
snapped
his
friend
the
thing
that
plagues
me
most
said
wilding
ignoring
the
remark
is
that
we
are
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
letter
contents
at
a
time
when
we
most
long
for
news
not
a
doubt
but
it
would
have
enabled
us
to
set
our
minds
at
ease
on
the
score
of
these
foolish
aye
or
else
confirmed
them
said
pessimistic
trenchard
he
wagged
his
head
they
say
the
duke
has
put
to
sea
folly
wilding
protested
whitehall
thinks
otherwise
what
of
the
troops
at
taunton
more
would
you
had
that
at
least
said
wilding
i
have
the
superscription
and
we
know
from
shenke
that
no
name
was
mentioned
in
the
letter
there
evidence
enough
without
it
trenchard
reminded
him
and
fell
soon
after
into
abstraction
turning
over
in
his
mind
a
notion
with
which
he
had
suddenly
been
inspired
that
notion
kept
trenchard
secretly
occupied
for
a
couple
of
days
but
in
the
end
he
succeeded
in
perfecting
it
now
it
befell
that
towards
dusk
one
evening
early
in
the
week
richard
westmacott
went
abroad
alone
as
was
commonly
his
habit
his
goal
being
the
saracen
head
where
he
and
sir
rowland
spent
many
a
night
over
wine
and
cards
to
sir
rowland
moderate
profit
for
he
had
not
played
the
pigeon
in
town
so
long
without
having
acquired
sufficient
knowledge
to
enable
him
to
play
the
rook
in
the
country
as
westmacott
was
passing
up
the
high
street
a
black
shadow
fell
athwart
the
light
that
streamed
from
the
door
of
the
bell
inn
and
out
through
the
doorway
lurched
trenchard
a
thought
unsteadily
to
hurtle
so
violently
against
richard
that
he
broke
the
long
stem
of
the
white
clay
pipe
he
was
carrying
now
richard
was
not
to
know
that
trenchard
having
informed
himself
of
westmacott
evening
habits
had
been
waiting
for
the
past
in
that
doorway
hoping
that
westmacott
would
not
depart
this
evening
from
his
usual
custom
another
thing
that
westmacott
was
not
to
know
considering
his
youth
was
the
singular
histrionic
ability
which
this
old
rake
had
displayed
in
those
younger
days
of
his
when
he
had
been
a
player
and
the
further
circumstance
that
he
had
excelled
in
those
parts
in
which
ebriety
was
to
be
counterfeited
indeed
we
have
it
on
the
word
of
no
less
an
authority
on
theatrical
matters
than
pepys
that
nicholas
trenchard
appearance
as
pistol
in
henry
iv
in
the
year
of
the
blessed
restoration
was
the
talk
alike
of
town
and
court
trenchard
steadied
himself
from
the
impact
and
swearing
a
round
and
awful
elizabethan
oath
accused
the
other
of
being
drunk
then
struck
an
attitude
to
demand
with
truculence
would
ye
take
the
wall
me
sir
richard
hastened
to
make
himself
known
to
this
turbulent
roysterer
who
straightway
forgot
his
grievance
to
take
westmacott
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
overwhelm
him
with
apologies
and
that
done
trenchard
who
affected
the
condition
known
as
maudlin
drunk
must
needs
protest
almost
in
tears
how
profound
was
his
love
for
richard
and
insist
that
the
boy
return
with
him
to
the
bell
inn
that
they
might
pledge
each
other
richard
himself
sober
was
contemptuous
of
trenchard
so
obviously
obfuscated
at
first
it
was
his
impulse
to
excuse
himself
as
possibly
blake
might
be
already
waiting
for
him
but
on
second
thoughts
remembering
that
trenchard
was
wilding
most
intimate
famulus
it
occurred
to
him
that
by
a
little
crafty
questioning
he
might
succeed
in
smoking
wilding
intentions
in
the
matter
of
that
letter
for
from
his
sister
he
had
failed
to
get
satisfaction
so
he
permitted
himself
to
be
led
indoors
to
a
table
by
the
window
which
stood
vacant
there
were
at
the
time
a
dozen
guests
or
so
in
the
trenchard
bawled
for
wine
and
brandy
and
for
all
that
he
babbled
in
an
irresponsible
foolish
manner
of
all
things
that
were
of
no
matter
yet
not
the
most
adroit
of
pumping
could
elicit
from
him
any
such
information
as
richard
sought
perforce
young
westmacott
must
remain
plying
him
with
more
and
more
drink
and
being
plied
in
his
turn
to
the
end
that
he
might
not
waste
the
occasion
an
hour
later
found
richard
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
trenchard
certainly
no
better
richard
forgot
his
purpose
forgot
that
blake
waited
for
him
at
the
saracen
head
and
now
trenchard
seemed
to
be
pulling
himself
together
i
want
to
talk
to
you
richard
said
he
and
although
thick
there
was
in
his
voice
a
certain
impressive
quality
that
had
been
absent
hitherto
a
rumour
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
almost
and
leaning
across
took
his
companion
by
the
arm
he
hiccoughed
noisily
then
began
again
a
rumour
current
sweetheart
that
richard
started
and
his
mind
flapped
and
struggled
like
a
trapped
bird
to
escape
the
meshes
of
the
wine
to
the
end
that
he
might
convincingly
defend
himself
from
such
an
imputation
so
dangerously
true
a
lie
he
gasped
trenchard
shut
one
eye
and
owlishly
surveyed
his
companion
with
the
other
they
say
he
added
that
you
for
forsaking
villainous
richard
protested
i
sli
throat
of
any
man
says
and
draining
the
pewter
at
his
elbow
he
smashed
it
down
on
the
table
to
emphasize
his
seriousness
trenchard
replenished
it
with
the
utmost
promptness
then
sat
back
in
his
tall
chair
and
pulled
a
moment
at
the
fresh
pipe
with
which
he
had
equipped
himself
i
think
i
espy
he
quoted
presently
and
valour
crouched
in
thine
eye
and
yet
and
yet
if
i
had
cause
to
think
it
true
i
i
run
you
through
the
vitals
jus
so
and
he
prodded
richard
waistcoat
with
the
point
of
his
his
swarthy
face
darkened
his
eyes
glittered
fiercely
are
ye
sure
ye
norrer
foul
traitor
he
demanded
suddenly
are
y
sure
for
if
ye
not
he
left
the
terrible
menace
unuttered
but
it
was
none
the
less
understood
it
penetrated
the
vinous
fog
that
beset
the
brain
of
richard
and
startled
him
i
not
he
cried
mos
solemnly
i
swear
echoed
trenchard
and
his
scowl
grew
darker
still
swear
a
man
may
swear
and
yet
lie
man
may
smile
and
smile
and
be
a
villain
i
have
proof
of
your
loyalty
to
us
i
have
proof
or
as
there
a
heaven
above
and
a
hell
below
i
rip
you
his
mien
was
terrific
and
his
voice
the
more
threatening
in
that
it
was
not
raised
above
a
whisper
richard
sat
back
appalled
afraid
wha
what
proof
satisfy
you
he
asked
trenchard
considered
it
pulling
at
his
pipe
again
pledge
me
the
duke
said
he
at
length
ther
truth
wine
pledge
me
the
duke
and
confusion
to
his
majesty
the
richard
reached
for
his
pewter
glad
that
the
test
was
to
be
so
light
up
on
your
feet
man
grumbled
trenchard
on
your
feet
and
see
that
your
words
have
a
ring
of
truth
in
richard
did
as
he
was
bidden
the
little
reason
left
him
being
concentrated
wholly
on
the
convincing
of
his
fellow
tippler
he
rose
to
his
feet
so
unsteadily
that
his
chair
fell
over
with
a
bang
he
never
heeded
it
but
others
in
the
room
turned
at
the
sound
and
a
hush
fell
in
the
chamber
dominating
this
came
richard
voice
strident
with
intensity
if
thick
of
utterance
down
with
popery
and
god
save
the
protestant
duke
he
cried
down
with
popery
and
he
looked
at
trenchard
for
applause
and
assurance
that
trenchard
no
longer
thought
there
was
cause
to
quarrel
with
him
behind
him
there
was
a
stir
in
the
room
that
went
unheeded
by
the
boy
men
nudged
their
neighbours
some
looked
frightened
and
some
grinned
at
the
treasonable
words
a
swift
change
came
over
trenchard
his
drunkenness
fell
from
him
like
a
discarded
mantle
he
sat
like
a
man
amazed
then
he
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
in
a
fury
and
smashed
down
his
pipestem
on
the
wooden
table
sending
its
fragments
flying
damn
me
he
roared
have
i
sat
at
table
with
a
traitor
and
he
thrust
at
richard
with
his
open
palm
lightly
yet
with
sufficient
force
to
throw
richard
off
his
precarious
balance
and
send
him
sprawling
on
the
sanded
floor
men
rose
from
the
tables
about
and
approached
them
some
few
amused
but
the
majority
very
grave
dodsley
the
landlord
came
hurrying
to
assist
richard
to
his
feet
mr
westmacott
he
whispered
in
the
rash
fool
ear
you
were
best
richard
stood
up
leaning
his
full
weight
upon
the
arm
the
landlord
had
about
his
waist
he
passed
a
hand
over
his
brow
as
if
to
brush
aside
the
veil
that
obscured
his
wits
what
had
happened
what
had
he
said
what
had
trenchard
done
why
did
these
fellows
stand
and
gape
at
him
he
heard
his
companion
voice
raised
to
address
the
company
gentlemen
he
heard
him
say
i
trust
there
is
none
present
will
impute
to
me
any
share
in
such
treasonable
sentiments
as
westmacott
has
expressed
but
if
there
is
any
who
questions
my
loyalty
i
have
a
convincing
argument
for
him
in
my
and
he
struck
his
with
his
fist
then
he
clapped
on
his
hat
aslant
over
the
locks
of
his
golden
wig
and
taking
up
his
whip
he
moved
with
leisurely
dignity
towards
the
door
he
looked
back
with
a
sardonic
smile
at
the
ado
he
was
leaving
behind
him
listened
a
moment
to
the
voices
that
already
were
being
raised
in
excitement
then
closed
the
door
and
made
his
way
briskly
to
the
where
he
called
for
his
horse
he
rode
out
of
bridgwater
ten
minutes
later
and
took
the
road
to
taunton
as
the
moon
was
rising
big
and
yellow
over
the
hills
on
his
left
he
reached
taunton
towards
ten
that
night
having
ridden
his
first
visit
was
to
the
hare
and
hounds
where
blake
and
westmacott
had
overtaken
the
courier
his
next
to
the
house
where
sir
edward
phelips
and
colonel
luttrell
the
gentlemen
lately
ordered
to
taunton
by
his
majesty
had
their
lodging
the
fruits
of
trenchard
extraordinary
behaviour
that
night
were
to
be
seen
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
day
when
a
constable
and
three
came
with
a
warrant
to
arrest
richard
westmacott
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
they
found
the
young
man
still
abed
and
most
guilty
was
his
panic
when
they
bade
him
rise
and
dress
himself
though
little
did
he
dream
of
the
full
extent
to
which
trenchard
had
enmeshed
him
or
indeed
that
trenchard
had
any
hand
at
all
in
this
affair
what
time
he
was
getting
into
his
clothes
with
a
outside
his
door
and
another
on
guard
under
his
window
the
constable
and
his
third
myrmidon
made
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
house
all
they
found
of
interest
was
a
letter
signed
monmouth
which
they
took
from
the
secret
drawer
of
a
secretary
in
the
library
but
that
it
seemed
was
all
they
sought
for
having
found
it
they
proceeded
no
further
with
their
reckless
and
destructive
ransacking
with
that
letter
and
the
person
of
richard
westmacott
the
constable
and
his
men
took
their
departure
and
rode
back
to
taunton
leaving
alarm
and
sore
distress
at
lupton
house
in
her
despair
poor
ruth
was
all
for
following
her
brother
in
the
hope
that
at
least
by
giving
evidence
of
how
that
letter
came
into
his
possession
she
might
do
something
to
assist
him
but
knowing
as
she
did
that
he
had
had
his
share
in
the
treason
that
was
hatching
she
had
cause
to
fear
that
his
guilt
would
not
lack
for
other
proofs
it
was
diana
who
urged
her
to
repair
instead
to
the
only
man
upon
whose
resource
she
might
depend
provided
he
were
willing
to
exert
it
that
man
was
anthony
wilding
and
whether
diana
urged
it
from
motives
of
her
own
or
out
of
concern
for
richard
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
with
certainty
the
very
thought
of
going
to
him
for
aid
after
all
that
had
passed
was
repugnant
to
ruth
and
yet
what
choice
had
she
convinced
by
her
cousin
and
urged
by
her
affection
and
duty
to
richard
she
repressed
her
aversion
and
calling
for
a
horse
rode
out
to
zoyland
chase
attended
by
a
groom
wilding
by
good
fortune
was
at
home
hard
at
work
upon
a
mass
of
documents
in
that
same
library
where
she
had
talked
with
him
on
the
occasion
of
her
first
visit
to
his
home
to
the
home
of
which
she
remembered
that
she
was
now
herself
the
mistress
he
was
preparing
for
circulation
in
the
west
a
mass
of
libels
and
incendiary
pamphlets
calculated
to
forward
the
cause
of
the
protestant
duke
dissembling
his
surprise
he
bade
old
walters
who
left
her
waiting
in
the
hall
whilst
he
went
to
announce
her
to
admit
her
instantly
and
he
advanced
to
the
door
to
receive
and
welcome
her
ruth
said
he
and
his
face
was
oddly
alight
you
have
come
at
she
smiled
a
wan
smile
of
i
have
been
constrained
said
she
and
told
him
what
had
happened
that
her
brother
had
been
arrested
for
high
treason
and
that
the
constable
in
searching
the
house
had
come
upon
the
monmouth
letter
she
had
locked
away
in
her
desk
and
not
a
doubt
she
ended
but
it
will
be
believed
that
it
was
to
richard
the
letter
was
indited
by
the
duke
you
will
remember
that
its
only
address
was
my
good
friend
and
that
will
stand
for
westmacott
as
well
as
wilding
was
fain
to
laugh
at
the
irony
of
this
surprising
turn
of
things
of
which
she
brought
him
news
for
he
had
neither
knowledge
nor
suspicion
of
the
machinations
of
his
friend
trenchard
to
which
these
events
were
due
but
noting
and
respecting
her
anxiety
for
her
brother
he
curbed
his
natural
amusement
it
is
a
judgment
upon
you
said
he
nevertheless
do
you
exult
she
asked
indignantly
no
but
i
can
not
repress
my
admiration
for
the
ways
of
divine
justice
if
you
are
come
to
me
for
advice
i
can
but
suggest
that
you
should
follow
your
brother
captors
to
taunton
and
inform
the
lieutenants
of
how
the
letter
came
into
your
she
looked
at
him
in
anger
almost
at
what
seemed
a
callousness
would
he
believe
me
think
you
belike
he
would
not
said
wilding
you
can
but
if
i
told
them
it
was
addressed
to
you
she
said
eyeing
him
sternly
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
they
would
send
for
you
to
question
you
and
that
if
they
did
so
as
you
are
a
gentleman
you
could
not
lie
away
my
brother
why
yes
said
he
quite
calmly
it
does
occur
to
me
but
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
by
the
time
they
came
here
they
would
find
me
gone
he
laughed
at
her
dismay
i
thank
you
madam
for
this
warning
he
added
i
think
i
bid
them
saddle
for
me
without
delay
too
long
already
have
i
and
must
richard
hang
she
asked
him
fiercely
wilding
produced
a
snuffbox
of
tortoise
shell
and
gold
he
opened
it
deliberately
if
he
does
you
admit
that
he
will
hang
on
the
gallows
that
he
has
built
himself
although
intended
for
another
not
the
first
booby
to
be
caught
in
his
own
springe
there
is
in
this
a
measure
of
poetic
justice
poetry
and
justice
do
you
know
ruth
they
are
two
things
i
have
ever
loved
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
choice
bergamot
will
you
be
serious
she
demanded
trenchard
would
tell
you
that
it
were
to
make
an
exception
from
the
rule
of
my
life
he
assured
her
smiling
yet
even
that
might
i
do
at
your
but
this
is
a
serious
matter
she
told
him
angrily
for
richard
he
acknowledged
closing
his
snuffbox
with
a
snap
tell
me
what
would
you
have
me
do
since
he
asked
her
thus
she
answered
him
in
two
words
save
at
the
cost
of
my
own
neck
quoth
he
the
price
is
high
he
reminded
her
do
you
think
that
richard
is
quite
worth
it
and
are
you
to
save
yourself
at
the
cost
of
his
she
are
you
capable
of
such
a
baseness
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
a
moment
you
have
not
reflected
said
he
slowly
that
in
this
affair
is
involved
more
than
mine
or
life
there
is
a
great
cause
weighing
in
the
balance
against
all
personal
considerations
if
i
accounted
richard
of
more
value
to
monmouth
than
i
am
myself
i
should
not
hesitate
in
riding
to
set
him
free
by
taking
his
place
as
it
is
however
i
think
i
am
of
the
greatest
conceivable
importance
to
his
grace
whilst
if
twenty
richards
perished
frankly
their
loss
would
be
something
of
a
gain
for
richard
has
played
a
traitor
part
already
that
is
with
me
the
first
of
all
am
i
of
no
consideration
to
you
she
asked
him
and
in
an
agony
of
terror
for
her
brother
she
now
approached
him
and
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
cast
herself
upon
her
knees
before
him
listen
she
cried
not
thus
said
he
a
frown
between
his
eyes
he
took
her
by
the
elbows
and
gently
but
very
firmly
brought
her
to
her
feet
again
it
is
not
fitting
you
should
kneel
save
at
your
she
was
standing
now
and
very
close
to
him
his
hands
still
held
her
elbows
though
their
touch
was
so
light
that
she
scarce
felt
it
to
release
them
was
easy
and
the
next
second
her
hands
were
on
his
shoulders
her
brave
eyes
raised
to
him
mr
wilding
she
implored
him
you
not
let
richard
be
destroyed
he
looked
down
at
her
with
kindling
glance
his
arms
slipped
round
her
lissom
waist
it
is
hard
to
deny
you
ruth
said
he
yet
not
my
love
of
my
own
life
compels
me
but
my
duty
my
loyalty
to
the
cause
to
which
i
am
pledged
i
were
a
traitor
were
i
now
to
place
myself
in
she
pressed
against
him
her
face
so
close
to
his
that
her
breath
fanned
his
cheek
whither
a
faint
colour
crept
in
quick
response
despite
herself
almost
instinctively
unconsciously
she
exerted
the
weapons
of
her
sex
to
bend
him
to
her
will
you
say
you
love
me
she
whispered
prove
it
me
now
and
i
will
believe
you
ah
he
sighed
and
believing
me
what
then
he
had
himself
grimly
in
hand
yet
feared
he
should
not
prove
strong
enough
to
hold
himself
for
long
you
you
shall
find
me
your
dutiful
wife
she
faltered
crimsoning
his
arms
tightened
about
her
he
crushed
her
to
him
he
bent
his
head
to
hers
and
his
lips
burnt
the
lips
she
yielded
to
him
as
though
they
had
been
living
fire
anon
she
was
to
weep
in
shame
in
shame
and
in
astonishment
at
that
instant
of
surrender
but
for
the
moment
she
had
no
thought
save
for
her
brother
exultation
filled
her
she
accounted
that
she
had
conquered
and
she
gloried
in
the
power
her
beauty
gave
her
a
power
that
had
sufficed
to
melt
to
water
the
purposes
of
this
man
the
next
instant
however
she
was
cold
again
with
dismay
and
newborn
terror
he
unclasped
her
arms
he
drew
back
shaking
off
the
hands
she
had
rested
upon
his
shoulders
his
white
face
the
flush
had
faded
from
it
again
smiled
a
thought
disdainfully
you
bargain
with
me
he
said
but
i
have
some
knowledge
of
your
ways
of
trading
they
are
overshrewd
for
an
honest
you
mean
she
gasped
her
hand
pressed
to
her
heart
her
face
a
deathly
white
you
mean
that
you
not
save
him
i
mean
said
he
that
i
will
have
no
further
bargains
with
there
was
such
hard
finality
in
his
tone
that
she
recoiled
beaten
and
without
power
to
return
to
the
assault
she
had
played
and
lost
she
had
yielded
her
lips
to
his
kisses
and
husband
though
he
might
be
in
name
shame
was
her
only
guerdon
one
look
she
gave
him
from
out
of
that
face
so
white
and
pitiful
then
with
a
shudder
turned
from
him
and
fled
his
presence
he
sprang
after
her
as
the
door
closed
then
checked
and
stood
in
thought
very
grim
for
one
who
professed
to
bestow
no
seriousness
on
the
affairs
of
life
then
he
returned
slowly
to
his
and
rummaged
there
among
the
papers
with
which
it
was
encumbered
seeking
something
of
which
he
now
had
need
through
the
open
window
he
heard
the
retreating
beat
of
her
horse
hoofs
he
sighed
and
sat
down
heavily
to
take
his
long
square
chin
in
his
hand
and
stare
before
him
at
the
sunlight
on
the
lawn
outside
and
whilst
he
sat
thus
ruth
made
all
haste
back
to
lupton
house
to
tell
of
the
failure
that
had
attended
her
there
was
nothing
left
her
now
but
to
embark
upon
the
forlorn
hope
of
following
richard
to
taunton
to
offer
her
evidence
of
how
the
incriminating
letter
had
come
to
be
locked
in
the
drawer
in
which
the
constable
had
discovered
it
diana
met
her
with
a
face
as
white
as
her
own
and
infinitely
more
startled
she
had
just
learnt
that
sir
rowland
blake
had
been
arrested
also
and
that
he
had
been
carried
to
taunton
together
with
richard
and
as
a
consequence
she
was
as
eager
now
that
ruth
should
repair
to
albemarle
as
she
had
erstwhile
been
earnest
in
urging
her
to
seek
out
wilding
indeed
diana
went
so
far
as
to
offer
to
accompany
her
an
offer
that
ruth
gladly
gratefully
accepted
within
an
hour
ruth
and
diana
in
spite
of
all
that
poor
docile
lady
horton
had
said
to
stay

to

by

lately

chapter
x
their
own
petard
in
a
lofty
spacious
room
of
the
town
hall
at
taunton
sat
sir
edward
phelips
and
colonel
luttrell
to
dispense
justice
and
with
them
flanked
by
one
of
them
on
either
side
of
him
sat
christopher
monk
duke
of
albemarle
of
devonshire
who
had
been
summoned
in
all
haste
from
exeter
that
he
might
be
present
at
an
examination
which
promised
to
be
of
so
vast
importance
the
three
sat
at
a
long
table
at
the
room
end
attended
by
two
secretaries

them
guarded
by
constable
and
weaponless
their
hands
pinioned
behind
them
blake

healed
by
now
stood
westmacott
and
his
friend
sir
rowland
to
answer
this
grave
charge
richard
not
knowing
who
might
have
betrayed
him
and
to
what
extent
was
very
fearful
having
through
his
connection
with
the
cause
every
reason
so
to
be
blake
on
the
other
hand
conscious
of
his
innocence
of
any
plotting
was
impatient
of
his
position
and
a
thought
contemptuous
it
was
he
who
upon
being
ushered
by
the
constable
and
his
men
into
the
august
presence
of
the
clamoured
to
know
precisely
of
what
he
was
accused
that
he
might
straightway
clear
himself
albemarle
reared
his
great
massive
head
smothered
in
a
mighty
black
peruke
and
scowled
upon
the
florid
london
beau
a
gentleman
was
christopher
monk
his
pendulous
cheeks
it
is
true
were
of
a
sallow
pallor
but
what
with
his
black
wig
black
eyebrows
dark
eyes
and
the
tint
of
shaven
beard
on
his
great
jaw
and
upper
lip
he
presented
an
appearance
sombrely
sinister
his
netherlip
was
thick
and
very
prominent
deep
creases
ran
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
adown
his
heavy
chin
his
eyes
were
dull
and
with
great
pouches
under
them
in
the
main
the
air
of
this
son
of
the
great
parliamentarian
general
was
stupid
dull
unprepossessing
the
creases
of
his
mouth
deepened
as
blake
protested
against
what
he
termed
this
outrage
that
had
been
done
him
he
sneered
ponderously
thrusting
further
forward
his
heavily
undershot
jowl
we
are
informed
sir
of
your
antecedents
he
staggered
blake
by
answering
we
have
learnt
the
reason
why
you
left
london
and
your
creditors
and
in
all
my
life
sir
i
have
never
known
a
man
more
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
treason
than
a
broken
gamester
your
kind
turns
by
instinct
to
such
work
as
this
as
a
last
resource
for
the
mending
of
battered
blake
crimsoned
from
chin
to
brow
i
forejudged
it
seems
he
made
answer
haughtily
tossing
his
fair
locks
his
blue
eyes
glaring
upon
his
judges
may
i
at
least
know
the
name
of
my
accuser
you
shall
receive
impartial
justice
at
our
hands
put
in
phelips
whose
manner
was
of
a
dangerous
mildness
depend
on
that
not
only
shall
you
know
the
name
of
your
accuser
but
you
shall
be
confronted
by
him
meanwhile
sirs
and
his
glance
strayed
from
blake
flushed
and
angry
countenance
to
richard
pale
and
timid
meanwhile
are
we
to
understand
that
you
deny
the
charge
i
have
heard
none
as
yet
said
sir
rowland
insolently
albemarle
turned
to
one
of
the
secretaries
read
them
the
indictment
said
he
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
his
dull
glance
upon
the
prisoners
whilst
the
clerk
in
a
droning
voice
read
from
a
document
which
he
took
up
it
impeached
sir
rowland
blake
and
richard
westmacott
of
holding
treasonable
communication
with
james
scott
duke
of
monmouth
and
of
plotting
against
his
majesty
life
and
throne
and
the
peace
of
his
majesty
realms
blake
listened
with
unconcealed
impatience
to
the
farrago
of
legal
phrases
and
snorted
contemptuously
when
the
reading
came
to
an
end
albemarle
looked
at
him
darkly
i
do
thank
god
said
he
that
through
westmacott
folly
has
this
hideous
plot
this
black
and
damnable
treason
been
brought
to
light
in
time
to
enable
us
to
stamp
out
this
fire
ere
it
is
well
kindled
have
you
aught
to
say
sir
i
have
to
say
that
the
whole
charge
a
foul
and
unfounded
lie
said
sir
rowland
bluntly
i
never
plotted
in
my
life
against
anything
but
my
own
prosperity
nor
against
any
man
but
albemarle
smiled
coldly
at
his
colleagues
then
turned
to
westmacott
and
you
sir
he
said
are
you
as
stubborn
as
your
friend
i
incontinently
deny
the
charge
said
richard
and
he
contrived
that
his
voice
should
ring
bold
and
resolute
a
charge
built
on
air
sneered
blake
which
the
first
breath
of
truth
should
utterly
dispel
we
have
heard
the
impeachment
will
your
grace
with
the
same
consideration
permit
us
to
see
the
proofs
that
we
may
lay
bare
their
falseness
it
should
not
be
do
you
say
there
is
no
such
plot
as
is
here
alleged
quoth
the
duke
and
smote
a
paper
sharply
blake
shrugged
his
shoulders
how
should
i
know
he
asked
i
say
i
have
no
share
in
any
that
i
am
acquainted
with
call
trenchard
said
the
duke
quietly
and
an
usher
who
had
stood
tamely
by
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
departed
on
the
errand
richard
started
at
the
mention
of
that
name
he
had
a
singular
dread
of
trenchard
colonel
luttrell
lean
and
wiry
now
addressed
the
prisoners
blake
more
particularly
still
said
he
you
will
admit
that
such
a
plot
may
indeed
exist
it
may
indeed
for
aught
i
know
or
care
he
added
incautiously
albemarle
smote
the
table
with
a
heavy
hand
by
god
he
cried
in
that
deep
booming
voice
of
his
there
spoke
a
traitor
you
do
not
care
you
say
what
plots
may
be
hatched
against
his
majesty
life
and
crown
yet
you
ask
me
to
believe
you
a
true
and
loyal
blake
was
angered
he
was
at
best
a
man
deliberately
he
floundered
further
into
the
mire
i
have
not
asked
your
grace
to
believe
me
anything
he
answered
hotly
it
is
all
one
to
me
what
your
grace
believes
me
i
take
it
i
have
not
been
fetched
hither
to
be
confronted
with
what
your
grace
believes
you
have
preferred
a
lying
charge
against
me
i
ask
for
proofs
not
your
grace
beliefs
and
by
god
sir
you
are
a
daring
rogue
cried
albemarle
sir
rowland
eyes
blazed
anon
your
grace
when
having
failed
of
your
proofs
you
shall
be
constrained
to
restore
me
to
liberty
i
shall
ask
your
grace
to
unsay
that
albemarle
stared
confounded
and
in
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
trenchard
sauntered
in
cane
in
hand
his
hat
under
his
arm
a
wicked
smile
on
his
wizened
face
leaving
blake
veiled
threat
unanswered
the
duke
turned
to
the
old
rake
these
rogues
said
he
pointing
to
the
prisoners
demand
proofs
ere
they
will
admit
the
truth
of
the
those
proofs
said
trenchard
are
already
in
your
grace
aye
but
they
have
asked
to
be
confronted
with
their
trenchard
bowed
is
it
your
wish
then
that
i
recite
for
them
the
counts
on
which
i
have
based
the
accusation
i
laid
before
your
grace
if
you
will
condescend
so
far
said
albemarle
blister
me
roared
blake
when
the
duke
interrupted
him
by
god
sir
he
cried
i
have
no
such
disrespectful
language
here
you
observe
the
decency
of
speech
and
forbear
from
profanities
you
damned
rogue
or
by
god
i
commit
you
i
will
endeavour
said
blake
with
a
sarcasm
lost
on
albemarle
to
follow
your
grace
lofty
you
will
do
well
sir
said
the
duke
and
was
shocked
that
trenchard
should
laugh
at
such
a
moment
i
was
about
to
protest
sir
said
blake
that
it
is
monstrous
i
should
be
accused
by
trenchard
he
has
but
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
trenchard
bowed
to
him
across
the
chamber
admitted
sir
said
he
what
should
i
be
doing
in
bad
company
an
answer
this
that
set
albemarle
bawling
with
laughter
trenchard
turned
to
the
duke
i
will
begin
an
it
please
your
grace
with
the
expressions
used
last
night
in
my
presence
at
the
bell
inn
at
bridgwater
by
richard
westmacott
and
i
will
confine
myself
strictly
to
those
matters
on
which
my
testimony
can
be
corroborated
by
that
of
other
colonel
luttrell
interrupted
him
to
turn
to
richard
do
you
recall
those
expressions
sir
he
asked
him
richard
winced
under
the
question
nevertheless
he
braced
himself
to
make
the
best
defence
he
could
i
have
not
yet
heard
said
he
what
those
expressions
were
nor
when
i
hear
them
must
it
follow
that
i
recognize
them
as
my
own
i
must
admit
to
having
taken
more
wine
perhaps
than
than
whilst
he
sought
the
expression
that
he
needed
trenchard
cut
in
with
a
laugh
in
vino
veritas
gentlemen
and
his
grace
and
sir
edward
nodded
sagely
luttrell
preserved
a
stolid
exterior
he
seemed
less
prone
than
his
colleagues
to
forejudging
will
you
repeat
the
expressions
used
by
westmacott
sir
edward
begged
i
will
repeat
the
one
that
to
my
mind
matters
westmacott
getting
to
his
feet
and
in
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
god
save
the
protestant
duke
do
you
admit
it
sir
thundered
albemarle
his
eyes
glowering
upon
richard
hesitated
a
moment
pale
and
trembling
you
will
waste
breath
in
denying
it
said
trenchard
suavely
for
i
have
a
drawer
from
the
bell
inn
and
two
gentlemen
who
overheard
you
waiting
sir
cried
blake
what
treason
was
therein
that
if
he
silence
thundered
albemarle
let
westmacott
speak
for
richard
inspired
by
the
defence
blake
had
begun
took
the
same
line
of
argument
i
admit
that
in
the
heat
of
wine
i
may
have
used
such
words
said
he
but
i
deny
their
intent
to
be
treasonable
there
are
many
men
who
drink
to
the
prosperity
of
the
late
kings
son
natural
son
sir
natural
son
albemarle
amended
it
is
treason
to
speak
of
him
it
will
be
a
treason
presently
to
draw
breath
sneered
blake
if
it
be
said
trenchard
it
is
a
treason
you
not
be
long
faith
you
are
right
trenchard
said
the
duke
with
a
laugh
indeed
he
found
trenchard
a
most
pleasant
and
facetious
gentleman
still
insisted
richard
endeavouring
in
spite
of
these
irrelevancies
to
make
good
his
point
there
be
many
men
who
drink
daily
to
the
prosperity
of
the
late
king
natural
aye
sir
answered
albemarle
but
not
his
prosperity
in
horrid
plots
against
the
life
of
our
beloved
true
your
grace
very
true
purred
sir
edward
it
was
not
so
i
meant
to
toast
him
cried
richard
albemarle
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
took
up
a
sheet
of
paper
how
then
he
asked
comes
this
letter
this
letter
which
makes
plain
the
treason
upon
which
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
embarked
just
as
it
makes
plain
your
participation
in
it
how
comes
this
letter
to
be
found
in
your
possession
and
he
waved
the
letter
in
the
air
richard
went
the
colour
of
ashes
he
faltered
a
moment
then
took
refuge
in
the
truth
for
all
that
he
knew
beforehand
that
the
truth
was
bound
to
ring
more
false
than
any
lie
he
could
invent
that
letter
was
not
addressed
to
me
he
stammered
albemarle
read
the
subscription
to
my
good
friend
at
he
looked
up
a
heavy
sneer
thrusting
his
heavy
lip
still
further
out
what
do
you
say
to
that
does
not
stand
for
westmacott
it
does
of
course
not
said
albemarle
with
heavy
sarcasm
it
stands
for
wilkins
or
williams
or
or
indeed
i
can
bear
witness
that
it
does
not
exclaimed
sir
rowland
be
silent
sir
i
tell
you
bawled
the
duke
at
him
again
you
shall
bear
witness
soon
enough
i
promise
you
to
whom
then
he
resumed
turning
again
to
richard
do
you
say
that
this
letter
was
addressed
to
wilding
anthony
wilding
richard
answered
i
would
have
your
grace
to
observe
put
in
trench
ard
quietly
that
wilding
properly
speaking
does
not
reside
in
tush
cried
albemarle
the
rogue
but
mentions
the
first
name
with
a
that
occurs
to
him
he
not
even
an
ingenious
liar
and
how
sir
he
asked
richard
does
it
come
to
be
in
your
possession
having
been
addressed
as
you
say
to
wilding
aye
sir
said
sir
edward
blinking
his
weak
eyes
tell
us
richard
hesitated
again
and
looked
at
blake
blake
who
by
now
had
come
to
realize
that
his
friend
affairs
were
not
mended
by
his
interruptions
moodily
shrugged
his
shoulders
scowling
come
sir
said
colonel
luttrell
engagingly
answer
the
aye
roared
albemarle
let
your
invention
have
free
again
poor
richard
sought
refuge
in
the
truth
we
sir
rowland
here
and
i
had
reason
to
suspect
that
he
was
awaiting
such
a
tell
us
your
reasons
sir
if
we
are
to
credit
you
said
the
duke
and
it
was
plain
he
mocked
the
prisoner
it
was
moreover
a
request
that
staggered
richard
still
he
sought
to
find
a
reason
that
should
sound
plausible
we
inferred
it
from
certain
remarks
that
wilding
let
fall
in
our
tell
us
the
remarks
sir
the
duke
insisted
indeed
i
do
not
call
his
precise
words
to
mind
your
grace
but
they
were
such
that
we
suspicioned
and
you
would
have
me
believe
that
hearing
words
which
awoke
in
you
such
grave
suspicions
you
kept
your
suspicions
and
straightway
forgot
the
words
you
but
an
indifferent
trenchard
who
was
standing
by
the
long
table
leaned
forward
now
it
might
be
well
an
it
please
your
grace
said
he
to
waive
the
point
and
let
us
come
to
those
matters
which
are
of
greater
moment
let
him
tell
your
grace
how
he
came
by
the
aye
said
albemarle
we
do
but
waste
time
tell
us
then
how
came
the
letter
into
your
hands
with
sir
rowland
here
i
robbed
the
courier
as
he
was
riding
from
taunton
to
albemarle
laughed
and
sir
edward
smiled
you
robbed
him
eh
said
his
grace
very
well
but
how
did
it
happen
that
you
knew
he
had
the
letter
upon
him
or
was
it
that
you
were
playing
the
hightobymen
and
that
in
robbing
him
you
hoped
to
find
other
matters
not
so
sir
answered
richard
i
sought
but
the
and
how
knew
you
that
he
carried
it
did
you
learn
that
too
from
wilding
indiscretion
your
grace
has
said
what
an
impudent
rogue
have
we
here
cried
the
angry
duke
who
conceived
that
richard
was
purposely
dealing
in
effrontery
mr
trenchard
i
do
think
we
are
wasting
time
be
so
good
as
to
confound
them
both
with
the
truth
of
this
that
letter
said
trenchard
was
delivered
to
them
at
the
hare
and
hounds
here
at
taunton
by
a
gentleman
who
put
up
at
the
inn
and
was
there
joined
by
westmacott
and
sir
rowland
blake
they
opened
the
conversation
with
certain
cant
phrases
very
clearly
intended
as
passwords
thus
the
prisoners
said
to
the
messenger
as
they
seated
themselves
at
the
table
he
occupied
have
the
air
sir
of
being
from
overseas
to
which
the
courier
answered
yes
i
am
from
holland
the
land
of
orange
says
one
of
the
prisoners
and
other
things
replies
the
messenger
is
a
fair
wind
blowing
he
adds
to
which
one
of
the
prisoners
i
believe
it
was
sir
rowland
makes
answer
prosper
the
protestant
duke
and
blow
popery
to
hell
thereupon
the
landlord
caught
some
mention
of
a
letter
but
these
plotters
perceiving
that
they
were
perhaps
being
overheard
sent
him
away
to
fetch
them
wine
a
later
the
messenger
took
his
leave
and
the
prisoners
followed
a
very
few
minutes
albemarle
turned
to
the
prisoners
you
have
heard
story
how
do
you
say
is
it
true
or
untrue
you
will
waste
breath
in
denying
it
trenchard
took
it
again
upon
himself
to
admonish
them
for
i
have
with
me
the
landlord
of
the
hare
and
hounds
who
will
corroborate
upon
oath
what
i
have
we
do
not
deny
it
put
in
blake
but
we
submit
that
the
matter
is
susceptible
to
you
can
keep
your
explanations
till
your
trial
then
snapped
albemarle
i
have
heard
more
than
enough
to
commit
the
pair
of
you
to
but
your
grace
cried
sir
rowland
so
fiercely
that
one
of
the
set
a
restraining
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
am
ready
to
swear
that
what
i
did
and
what
my
friend
westmacott
did
was
done
in
the
interests
of
his
majesty
we
were
working
to
discover
this
which
no
doubt
put
in
trenchard
slyly
is
the
reason
why
having
got
the
letter
your
friend
westmacott
locked
it
in
a
desk
and
you
kept
silence
on
the
you
see
exclaimed
albemarle
how
your
lies
do
but
serve
further
to
bind
you
in
the
toils
it
is
ever
thus
with
i
do
think
you
are
a
damned
traitor
trenchard
began
blake
a
foul
but
what
more
he
would
have
said
was
checked
by
albemarle
who
thundered
forth
an
order
for
their
removal
and
then
scarce
were
the
words
uttered
than
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
was
opened
and
through
it
came
a
sound
of
women
voices
richard
started
for
one
was
the
voice
of
ruth
an
usher
advanced
may
it
please
your
grace
there
are
two
ladies
here
beg
that
you
will
hear
their
evidence
in
the
matter
of
westmacott
and
sir
rowland
albemarle
considered
a
moment
trenchard
stood
very
thoughtful
indeed
said
the
duke
at
last
i
have
heard
as
much
as
i
need
hear
and
sir
phelips
nodded
in
token
of
concurrence
not
so
however
colonel
luttrell
still
said
he
in
the
interests
of
his
majesty
perhaps
we
should
be
doing
well
to
receive
albemarle
blew
out
his
cheeks
like
a
man
wearied
and
stared
an
instant
at
luttrell
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
admit
them
then
he
commanded
almost
peevishly
and
ruth
and
diana
were
ushered
into
the
hall
both
were
pale
but
whilst
diana
was
fluttered
with
excitement
ruth
was
calm
and
cool
and
it
was
she
who
spoke
in
answer
to
the
duke
invitation
the
burden
of
her
speech
was
a
clear
succinct
recitation
in
which
she
spared
neither
wilding
nor
herself
of
how
the
letter
came
to
have
remained
in
her
hands
and
silence
to
have
been
preserved
regarding
it
albemarle
heard
her
very
patiently
if
what
you
say
is
true
mistress
said
he
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
be
so
ungallant
as
to
throw
doubt
upon
a
lady
word
it
certainly
explains
although
most
strangely
how
the
letter
was
not
brought
to
us
at
once
by
your
brother
and
his
friend
sir
rowland
you
are
prepared
to
swear
that
this
letter
was
intended
for
wilding
i
am
prepared
to
swear
it
she
replied
this
is
very
serious
said
the
duke
very
serious
assented
sir
edward
phelips
albemarle
a
little
flustered
turned
to
his
colleagues
what
do
you
say
to
this
were
it
perhaps
well
to
order
wilding
apprehension
and
to
have
him
brought
hither
it
were
to
give
yourselves
useless
trouble
gentlemen
said
trenchard
with
so
much
assurance
that
it
was
plain
albemarle
hesitated
beware
of
trenchard
your
grace
cried
ruth
he
is
friend
and
if
there
is
a
plot
he
is
sure
to
be
in
albemarle
startled
looked
at
trenchard
had
the
accusation
come
from
either
of
the
men
the
duke
would
have
silenced
him
and
abused
him
but
coming
from
a
woman
and
so
comely
a
woman
it
seemed
to
his
grace
worthy
at
least
of
consideration
but
nimble
trenchard
was
easily
master
of
the
situation
which
of
course
he
answered
with
fine
sarcasm
is
the
reason
why
i
have
been
at
work
for
the
past
hours
to
lay
proofs
of
this
plot
before
your
albemarle
was
ashamed
of
his
momentary
hesitation
for
the
rest
said
trenchard
it
is
perfectly
true
that
i
am
wilding
friend
but
the
lady
is
even
more
intimately
connected
with
him
it
happens
that
she
is
his
his
his
wife
gasped
the
duke
whilst
phelips
chuckled
and
colonel
luttrell
face
grew
dark
trenchard
wicked
smile
flickered
upon
his
mobile
features
there
are
rumours
current
of
court
paid
her
by
sir
rowland
there
who
knows
he
questioned
most
suggestively
arching
his
brows
and
tightening
his
lips
wives
are
strange
and
husbands
have
been
known
before
to
grow
inconvenient
upon
reflection
your
grace
will
no
doubt
discern
the
precise
degree
of
faith
to
attach
to
what
this
lady
may
tell
you
against
oh
exclaimed
ruth
her
cheeks
flaming
crimson
but
this
is
monstrous
tis
how
i
should
myself
describe
it
answered
trenchard
without
shame
spurred
to
it
thus
ruth
poured
out
the
entire
story
of
her
marriage
and
so
clear
and
lucid
was
her
statement
that
it
threw
upon
the
affair
a
flood
of
light
whilst
so
frank
and
truthful
was
her
tone
her
narrative
hung
so
well
together
that
the
bench
began
to
recover
from
the
shock
to
its
faith
and
was
again
in
danger
of
believing
her
trenchard
saw
this
and
trembled
to
save
wilding
for
the
cause
he
had
resorted
to
this
desperate
expedient
of
betraying
that
cause
it
must
be
observed
however
that
he
had
not
done
so
save
under
the
conviction
that
betrayed
it
was
bound
to
be
and
that
since
that
was
inevitable
the
thing
had
better
come
from
him
for
wilding
sake
than
from
richard
westmacott
he
had
taken
the
bull
by
the
horns
in
a
most
desperate
fashion
when
he
had
determined
to
hoist
richard
and
blake
with
their
own
petard
hoping
that
after
all
the
harm
would
reach
no
further
than
the
destruction
of
these
two
a
purely
defensive
measure
but
now
this
girl
threatened
to
wreck
his
scheme
just
as
it
was
being
safely
steered
to
harbour
suddenly
he
swung
round
interrupting
her
lies
lies
lies
he
clamoured
and
his
interruption
coming
at
such
a
time
served
to
impress
the
duke
most
unfavourably
as
well
it
might
it
is
our
wish
to
hear
this
lady
out
trenchard
the
duke
reproved
him
but
trenchard
was
undismayed
indeed
he
had
just
discovered
a
hitherto
neglected
card
which
should
put
an
end
to
this
dangerous
game
i
do
abhor
to
hear
your
grace
patience
thus
abused
he
exclaimed
with
some
show
of
heat
this
lady
makes
a
mock
of
you
if
you
allow
me
to
ask
two
questions
or
perhaps
three
i
promise
finally
to
prick
this
bubble
for
you
have
i
your
grace
leave
well
well
said
albemarle
let
us
hear
your
and
his
colleagues
nodded
trenchard
turned
airily
to
ruth
behind
her
diana
sat
an
attendant
had
fetched
a
chair
for
her
in
fear
and
wonder
at
what
she
saw
and
heard
her
eyes
ever
and
anon
straying
to
sir
rowland
back
which
was
towards
her
this
letter
madam
said
he
for
the
possession
of
which
you
have
accounted
in
so
so
picturesque
a
manner
was
intended
for
and
addressed
to
wilding
you
say
and
you
are
prepared
to
swear
to
it
ruth
turned
indignantly
to
the
bench
must
i
answer
this
questions
she
demanded
i
think
perhaps
it
were
best
you
did
said
the
duke
still
showing
her
all
deference
she
turned
to
trenchard
her
head
high
her
eyes
full
upon
his
wrinkled
cynical
face
i
swear
then
she
began
but
he
consummate
actor
that
he
was
and
versed
in
tricks
that
impress
an
audience
interrupted
her
raising
one
of
his
gnarled
yellow
hands
nay
nay
said
he
i
would
not
have
perjury
proved
against
you
i
do
not
ask
you
to
swear
it
will
be
sufficient
if
you
pronounce
yourself
prepared
to
she
pouted
her
lip
a
trifle
her
whole
expression
manifesting
her
contempt
of
him
i
am
in
no
fear
of
perjuring
myself
she
answered
fearlessly
and
i
swear
that
the
letter
in
question
was
addressed
to
as
you
will
said
trenchard
and
was
careful
not
to
ask
her
how
she
came
by
her
knowledge
the
letter
no
doubt
was
in
an
outer
wrapper
on
which
there
would
be
a
superscription
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
was
addressed
he
half
questioned
and
luttrell
who
saw
the
drift
of
the
question
nodded
gravely
no
doubt
said
ruth
now
you
will
acknowledge
i
am
sure
madam
that
such
a
wrapper
would
be
a
document
of
the
greatest
importance
as
important
indeed
as
the
letter
itself
since
we
could
depend
upon
it
finally
to
clear
up
this
point
on
which
we
differ
you
will
admit
so
much
i
think
why
yes
she
answered
but
her
voice
faltered
a
little
and
her
glance
was
not
quite
so
fearless
she
too
saw
at
last
the
pit
he
had
dug
for
her
he
leaned
forward
smiling
quietly
his
voice
impressively
subdued
and
launched
the
bolt
that
was
to
annihilate
the
credibility
of
the
story
she
had
told
can
you
then
explain
how
it
comes
that
that
wrapper
has
been
suppressed
can
you
tell
us
how
the
matter
being
as
you
state
it
in
very
against
the
dangers
of
keeping
such
a
letter
your
brother
did
not
also
keep
that
wrapper
her
eyes
fell
away
from
his
face
they
turned
to
albemarle
who
sat
scowling
again
and
from
him
they
flickered
unsteadily
to
phelips
and
luttrell
and
lastly
to
richard
who
very
white
and
with
set
teeth
stood
listening
to
the
working
of
his
ruin
i
i
do
not
know
she
faltered
at
last
ah
said
trenchard
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
turned
to
the
bench
need
i
suggest
what
was
the
need
the
urgent
need
for
suppressing
that
wrapper
quoth
he
need
i
say
what
name
was
inscribed
upon
it
i
think
not
your
grace
keen
insight
and
yours
gentlemen
will
determine
what
was
sir
rowland
now
stood
forward
addressing
albemarle
will
your
grace
permit
me
to
offer
my
explanation
of
this
albemarle
banged
the
table
his
patience
was
at
an
end
since
he
came
now
to
believe
as
trenchard
had
earlier
suggested
that
he
had
been
played
upon
by
ruth
too
many
explanations
have
i
heard
already
sir
he
answered
he
turned
to
one
of
his
secretaries
in
his
sudden
excess
of
choler
he
forgot
his
colleagues
altogether
the
prisoners
are
committed
for
trial
said
he
harshly
and
trenchard
breathed
freely
at
last
but
the
next
instant
he
caught
his
breath
again
for
a
ringing
voice
was
heard
without
demanding
to
see
his
grace
of
albemarle
at
once
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
anthony
wilding
chapter
xi
the
marplot
wilding
appearance
produced
as
many
different
emotions
as
there
were
individuals
present
he
made
the
company
a
sweeping
bow
on
his
admission
by
albemarle
orders
a
bow
which
was
returned
by
a
stare
from
one
and
all
diana
eyed
him
in
amazement
ruth
in
hope
richard
averted
his
glance
from
that
of
his
whilst
sir
rowland
met
it
with
a
scowl
of
enmity
they
had
not
come
face
to
face
since
the
occasion
of
that
encounter
in
which
sir
rowland
had
been
so
rudely
handled
albemarle
face
expressed
a
sort
of
satisfaction
which
was
reflected
on
the
countenances
of
phelips
and
luttrell
whilst
trenchard
never
thought
of
attempting
to
dissemble
his
profound
dismay
and
this
dismay
was
shared
though
not
in
so
deep
a
measure
by
wilding
himself
trenchard
presence
gave
him
pause
for
he
had
been
far
indeed
from
dreaming
that
his
friend
had
a
hand
in
this
affair
at
sight
of
him
all
was
made
clear
to
wilding
at
once
he
saw
the
role
which
trenchard
had
assumed
on
this
occasion
saw
to
the
bottom
of
the
motives
that
had
inspired
him
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
level
against
richard
and
blake
this
accusation
before
they
had
leisure
to
level
it
against
himself
his
quick
wits
having
fathomed
trenchard
motive
wilding
was
deeply
touched
by
this
proof
of
friendship
and
for
a
second
as
deeply
nonplussed
at
loss
now
how
to
discharge
the
task
on
which
he
came
you
are
very
choicely
come
wilding
said
albemarle
you
will
be
able
to
resolve
me
certain
doubts
which
have
been
set
on
foot
by
these
that
said
wilding
is
the
purpose
for
which
i
am
here
news
reached
me
of
the
arrest
that
had
been
made
may
i
beg
that
your
grace
will
place
me
in
possession
of
the
facts
that
have
so
far
it
was
one
of
his
secretaries
who
at
albemarle
bidding
gave
wilding
the
information
that
he
craved
he
listened
gravely
then
before
albemarle
had
time
to
question
him
on
the
score
of
the
name
that
might
have
been
upon
the
enfolding
wrapper
of
the
letter
he
begged
that
he
might
confer
apart
a
moment
with
trenchard
but
wilding
said
colonel
luttrell
surprised
not
to
hear
the
immediate
denial
of
the
imputation
they
had
expected
we
should
first
like
to
hear
by
your
leave
sirs
wilding
interrupted
i
should
prefer
that
you
ask
me
nothing
until
i
have
consulted
with
he
saw
luttrell
frown
observed
sir
edward
shift
his
wig
to
scratch
his
head
in
sheer
perplexity
and
caught
the
of
denial
on
the
duke
face
so
without
giving
any
of
them
time
to
say
him
nay
he
added
quickly
and
very
seriously
i
am
begging
this
in
the
interests
of
justice
your
grace
has
told
me
that
some
lingering
doubt
still
haunts
your
mind
upon
the
subject
of
this
letter
the
other
charges
can
matter
little
apart
from
that
treasonable
document
it
lies
within
my
power
to
resolve
such
doubts
most
clearly
and
finally
but
i
warn
you
sirs
that
not
one
word
will
i
utter
in
this
connection
until
i
have
had
speech
with
there
was
about
his
mien
and
voice
a
firmness
that
forewarned
albemarle
that
to
insist
would
be
worse
than
idle
a
slight
pause
followed
his
words
and
luttrell
leaned
across
to
whisper
in
his
grace
ear
from
the
duke
other
side
sir
edward
bent
his
head
forward
till
it
almost
touched
those
of
his
companions
blake
watched
and
was
most
foolishly
impatient
your
grace
will
never
allow
this
he
cried
eh
said
albemarle
scowling
at
him
if
you
allow
those
two
villains
to
consort
together
we
are
all
undone
the
baronet
protested
and
ruined
what
chance
there
was
of
not
consenting
it
was
the
one
thing
needed
to
determine
albemarle
like
the
stubborn
man
he
was
there
was
naught
he
detested
so
much
as
to
have
his
course
dictated
to
him
more
than
that
in
sir
rowland
anxiety
that
wilding
and
trenchard
should
not
be
allowed
to
confer
apart
he
smoked
a
fear
on
sir
rowland
part
based
upon
the
baronet
consciousness
of
his
own
guilt
he
turned
from
him
with
a
sneering
smile
and
without
so
much
as
consulting
his
associates
he
glanced
at
wilding
and
waved
his
hand
towards
the
door
pray
do
as
you
suggest
wilding
said
he
but
i
depend
upon
you
not
to
tax
our
i
shall
not
keep
trenchard
a
moment
longer
than
is
necessary
said
wilding
giving
no
hint
of
the
second
meaning
in
his
words
he
stepped
to
the
door
opened
it
himself
and
signed
to
trenchard
to
pass
out
the
old
player
obeyed
him
readily
if
in
silence
an
usher
closed
the
door
after
them
and
in
silence
they
walked
together
to
the
end
of
the
passage
where
is
your
horse
nick
quoth
wilding
abruptly
what
a
plague
do
you
mean
where
is
my
horse
flashed
trenchard
what
midsummer
frenzy
is
this
damn
you
for
a
marplot
anthony
what
a
pox
are
you
thinking
of
to
thrust
yourself
in
here
at
such
a
time
i
had
no
knowledge
you
were
in
the
affair
said
wilding
you
should
have
told
his
manner
was
brisk
to
the
point
of
dryness
however
there
is
still
time
to
get
you
out
of
it
where
is
your
horse
damn
my
horse
answered
trenchard
in
a
passion
you
have
spoiled
everything
on
the
contrary
said
wilding
tartly
it
seems
you
had
done
that
very
thoroughly
before
i
arrived
whilst
i
am
touched
by
the
regard
for
me
which
has
misled
you
into
turning
the
tables
on
blake
and
westmacott
yet
i
do
blame
you
for
this
betrayal
of
the
there
was
no
help
for
why
no
and
that
is
why
you
should
have
left
matters
where
they
trenchard
stamped
his
foot
indeed
he
almost
danced
in
the
excess
of
his
vexation
left
them
where
they
stood
he
echoed
body
o
me
where
are
your
wits
left
them
where
they
stood
and
at
any
moment
you
might
have
been
taken
unawares
as
a
consequence
of
this
accusation
being
lodged
against
you
by
richard
or
by
blake
then
the
cause
would
have
been
betrayed
not
more
so
than
it
is
not
less
at
least
snapped
the
player
you
give
me
credit
for
no
more
wit
than
yourself
do
you
think
that
i
am
the
man
to
do
things
by
halves
i
have
betrayed
the
plot
to
albemarle
but
do
you
imagine
i
have
made
no
provision
for
what
must
follow
provision
echoed
wilding
staring
aye
provision
god
lack
what
do
you
suppose
albemarle
will
do
dispatch
a
messenger
to
whitehall
with
the
letter
within
an
you
perceive
it
do
you
and
where
the
plague
do
you
think
nick
trenchard
be
what
time
that
messenger
rides
wilding
understood
aye
you
may
stare
sneered
trenchard
a
letter
that
has
once
been
stolen
may
be
stolen
again
the
courier
must
go
by
way
of
walford
i
had
in
my
mind
arranged
the
spot
close
by
the
ford
where
i
should
fall
upon
him
rob
him
of
his
dispatches
and
take
him
bound
hand
and
foot
if
necessary
to
vallancey
who
lives
close
by
and
there
i
leave
him
until
word
came
that
the
duke
had
that
the
duke
had
landed
cried
wilding
you
talk
as
though
the
thing
were
and
imminent
it
is
for
aught
we
know
he
may
be
in
england
wilding
laughed
impatiently
you
must
forever
be
building
on
these
rumours
nick
said
he
rumours
roared
the
other
rumours
ha
he
checked
his
wild
scorn
and
proceeded
in
a
different
key
i
was
forgetting
you
do
not
know
the
contents
of
that
stolen
wilding
started
underlying
his
disbelief
in
the
talk
of
the
countryside
and
even
in
the
military
measures
which
by
the
orders
were
being
taken
in
the
west
was
an
uneasy
dread
lest
they
should
prove
to
be
well
founded
lest
argyle
operations
in
scotland
should
be
but
the
forerunner
of
a
rash
and
premature
invasion
by
monmouth
he
knew
the
duke
was
surrounded
by
such
reckless
foolhardy
counsellors
as
grey
and
ferguson
and
yet
he
could
not
think
the
duke
would
ruin
all
by
coming
before
he
had
definite
word
that
his
friends
were
ready
he
looked
at
trenchard
now
with
anxious
eyes
have
you
seen
the
letter
nick
he
asked
and
almost
dreaded
the
reply
albemarle
showed
it
me
an
hour
ago
said
trenchard
and
it
contains
the
news
we
fear
it
is
in
the
duke
own
hand
and
intimates
that
he
will
follow
it
in
a
few
days
in
a
few
days
man
in
wilding
clenched
teeth
and
hands
god
help
us
all
then
he
muttered
grimly
meanwhile
quoth
trenchard
bringing
him
back
to
the
point
there
is
this
precious
business
here
i
had
as
choice
a
plan
as
could
have
been
devised
and
it
must
have
succeeded
had
you
not
come
blundering
into
it
to
mar
it
all
at
the
last
moment
that
fat
fool
albemarle
had
swallowed
my
impeachment
like
a
draught
of
muscadine
do
you
hear
me
he
ended
sharply
for
wilding
stood
bemused
his
thoughts
plainly
wandering
he
let
his
hand
fall
upon
trenchard
shoulder
no
said
he
i
listening
no
matter
for
even
had
i
known
the
full
extent
of
your
scheme
i
still
must
have
for
the
sake
of
mistress
westmacott
blue
eyes
no
doubt
sneered
trenchard
pah
wherever
there
a
woman
there
the
loss
of
a
for
the
sake
of
mistress
wilding
blue
eyes
his
friend
corrected
him
i
allow
no
brother
of
hers
to
hang
in
my
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
you
will
rescue
by
telling
the
truth
to
he
not
believe
i
shall
prove
it
said
wilding
quietly
trenchard
swung
round
upon
him
in
mingled
anger
and
alarm
for
him
you
shall
not
do
it
he
snarled
it
is
nothing
short
of
treason
to
the
duke
to
get
yourself
laid
by
the
heels
at
such
a
time
as
i
hope
to
avoid
it
answered
wilding
confidently
avoid
it
how
not
by
staying
longer
here
in
talk
that
will
ruin
all
away
with
you
trenchard
by
my
soul
no
answered
trenchard
i
not
leave
you
if
i
have
got
you
into
this
i
help
to
get
you
out
again
or
stay
in
it
with
bethink
you
of
monmouth
wilding
admonished
him
damn
monmouth
was
the
vicious
answer
i
am
here
and
here
i
get
to
horse
you
fool
and
ride
to
walford
as
you
proposed
there
to
ambush
the
messenger
the
letter
will
go
to
whitehall
none
the
less
in
spite
of
what
i
shall
tell
albemarle
if
things
go
well
with
me
i
shall
join
you
at
vallancey
before
why
if
that
is
your
intention
said
trenchard
i
had
better
stay
and
we
can
ride
together
it
will
make
it
less
uncertain
for
but
less
certain
for
the
more
reason
why
i
should
the
door
of
the
hall
was
suddenly
flung
open
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
albemarle
booming
voice
impatiently
raised
reached
them
where
they
stood
in
any
case
added
trenchard
it
seems
there
is
no
help
for
it
wilding
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
otherwise
dissembled
his
vexation
up
the
passage
floated
the
constable
voice
calling
them
side
by
side
they
moved
down
and
side
by
side
they
stepped
once
more
into
the
presence
of
christopher
monk
and
his
associates
sirs
you
have
not
been
in
haste
was
the
duke
greeting
we
have
tarried
a
little
that
we
might
make
an
end
the
sooner
answered
trenchard
dryly
and
this
was
the
first
indication
he
gave
wilding
of
how
naturally
like
the
inimitable
actor
that
he
was
he
had
slipped
into
his
new
role
albemarle
waved
the
frivolous
rejoinder
aside
come
wilding
said
he
let
us
hear
what
you
may
have
to
say
you
are
not
i
take
it
about
to
urge
any
reasons
why
these
rogues
should
not
be
committed
indeed
your
grace
said
wilding
that
is
what
i
am
about
to
blake
and
richard
looked
at
him
suddenly
and
from
him
to
trenchard
but
it
was
only
ruth
whose
eyes
were
shrewd
enough
to
observe
the
altered
demeanour
of
the
latter
her
hopes
rose
founded
upon
this
oddly
assorted
pair
already
in
anticipation
she
was
stirred
by
gratitude
towards
wilding
and
it
was
in
impatient
and
almost
wondering
awe
that
she
waited
for
him
to
proceed
i
take
it
sir
he
said
without
waiting
for
albemarle
to
express
any
of
the
fresh
astonishment
his
countenance
manifested
that
the
accusation
against
these
gentlemen
rests
entirely
upon
the
letter
which
you
have
been
led
to
believe
was
addressed
to
the
duke
scowled
a
moment
before
replying
why
said
he
if
it
could
be
shown
irrefutably
shown
that
the
letter
was
not
addressed
to
either
of
them
that
would
no
doubt
establish
the
truth
of
what
they
say
that
they
possessed
themselves
of
the
letter
in
the
interests
of
his
he
turned
to
luttrell
and
phelips
and
they
nodded
their
concurrence
with
his
view
of
the
matter
but
he
continued
if
you
are
proposing
to
prove
any
such
thing
i
think
you
will
find
it
wilding
drew
a
crumpled
paper
from
his
pocket
when
the
courier
whom
they
robbed
as
they
have
correctly
informed
you
said
he
quietly
suspected
their
design
upon
the
contents
of
his
wallet
he
bethought
him
of
removing
the
wrapper
from
the
letter
so
that
in
case
the
letter
were
seized
by
them
it
should
prove
nothing
against
any
man
in
particular
he
stuffed
the
wrapper
into
the
lining
of
his
hat
preserving
it
as
a
proof
of
his
good
faith
against
the
time
when
he
should
bring
the
letter
to
its
destination
or
come
to
confess
that
it
had
been
taken
from
him
that
wrapper
the
courier
brought
to
me
and
i
have
it
here
the
evidence
it
will
give
should
be
more
than
sufficient
to
warrant
your
restoring
these
unjustly
accused
gentlemen
their
the
courier
took
it
to
you
echoed
albemarle
stupefaction
in
his
glance
but
why
to
you
because
said
wilding
and
with
his
left
hand
he
placed
the
wrapper
before
albemarle
whilst
his
right
dropped
again
to
his
pocket
the
letter
as
you
may
see
was
addressed
to
the
quiet
manner
in
which
he
made
the
announcement
conveyed
almost
as
great
a
shock
as
the
announcement
itself
albemarle
took
up
the
wrapper
luttrell
and
phelips
craned
forward
to
join
him
in
his
scrutiny
of
it
they
compared
the
two
paper
with
paper
writing
with
writing
then
monk
flung
one
and
the
other
down
in
front
of
him
what
lies
have
i
been
hearing
then
he
demanded
furiously
of
trenchard
i
make
an
example
of
you
arrest
me
that
rogue
arrest
them
both
and
he
half
rose
from
his
seat
his
trembling
hand
pointing
to
wilding
and
trenchard
two
of
the
stirred
to
do
his
bidding
but
in
the
same
instant
albemarle
found
himself
looking
into
the
round
nozzle
of
a
pistol
if
said
wilding
a
finger
is
laid
upon
trenchard
or
me
i
shall
have
the
extreme
mortification
of
being
compelled
to
shoot
your
his
pleasantly
modulated
voice
was
as
deliberate
and
calm
as
if
he
were
offering
the
bench
a
pinch
of
snuff
albemarle
dark
visage
crimsoned
his
eyes
became
at
once
wicked
and
afraid
sir
edward
cheeks
turned
pale
his
glance
grew
startled
luttrell
alone
vigilant
and
dangerous
preserved
his
calm
but
the
situation
baffled
even
him
behind
the
two
friends
the
had
come
to
a
halt
diana
had
risen
from
her
chair
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
had
drawn
close
to
ruth
who
looked
on
with
parted
lips
and
bosom
that
rose
and
fell
even
blake
could
not
stifle
his
admiration
of
wilding
coolness
and
address
richard
on
the
other
hand
was
concerned
only
with
thoughts
for
himself
wondering
how
it
would
fare
with
him
if
wilding
and
trenchard
succeeded
in
getting
away
nick
said
wilding
will
you
desire
those
catchpolls
behind
us
to
stand
aside
if
your
grace
raises
your
voice
to
call
for
help
if
indeed
any
measures
are
taken
calculated
to
lead
to
our
capture
i
can
promise
your
grace
notwithstanding
my
profound
reluctance
to
use
violence
that
they
will
be
the
last
measures
you
will
take
in
life
be
good
enough
to
open
the
door
nick
and
to
see
that
the
key
is
on
the
trenchard
who
was
by
way
of
enjoying
himself
now
stepped
briskly
down
the
hall
to
do
as
his
friend
bade
him
with
a
wary
eye
on
the
but
never
so
much
as
a
finger
did
they
dare
to
lift
wilding
calm
was
too
deadly
they
had
seen
a
man
in
earnest
before
this
and
they
knew
his
appearance
now
from
the
doorway
trenchard
called
wilding
i
must
be
going
your
grace
said
the
latter
very
courteously
but
i
shall
not
be
so
wanting
in
deference
to
his
majesty
august
representatives
as
to
turn
my
back
upon
saying
which
he
walked
backwards
holding
his
pistol
level
until
he
had
reached
trenchard
and
the
door
there
he
paused
and
made
them
a
deep
bow
his
manner
the
more
mocking
in
that
there
was
no
tinge
of
mockery
perceptible
your
very
obedient
servant
said
he
and
stepped
outside
trenchard
turned
the
key
withdrew
it
from
the
lock
and
standing
on
tiptoe
thrust
it
upon
the
ledge
of
the
lintel
instantly
a
clamour
arose
within
the
chamber
but
the
two
friends
never
stayed
to
listen
down
the
passage
they
sped
at
the
double
and
out
into
the
courtyard
here
ruth
groom
mounted
himself
was
walking
his
mistress
and
diana
horses
up
and
down
whilst
he
waited
yonder
one
of
sir
edward
was
holding
wilding
roan
two
or
three
men
of
the
somerset
militia
in
their
red
and
yellow
liveries
lounged
by
the
gates
and
turned
uninterested
eyes
upon
these
newcomers
wilding
approached
his
wife
groom
get
down
he
said
i
need
your
horse
on
the
king
business
get
down
i
say
he
added
impatiently
upon
noting
the
fellow
stare
and
seizing
his
leg
he
helped
him
to
dismount
by
almost
dragging
him
from
the
saddle
up
with
you
nick
said
he
and
nick
very
promptly
mounted
your
mistress
will
be
here
presently
wilding
told
the
groom
and
turning
on
his
heel
strode
to
his
own
mare
a
moment
later
trenchard
and
he
vanished
through
the
gateway
with
a
tremendous
clatter
just
as
the
colonel
luttrell
sir
edward
phelips
the
constable
the
sir
rowland
richard
and
the
ladies
made
their
appearance
ruth
pushed
her
way
quickly
to
the
front
she
feared
lest
her
horse
and
her
cousin
being
at
hand
might
be
used
for
the
pursuit
so
urging
diana
to
do
the
same
she
snatched
her
reins
from
the
hands
of
the
dumbfounded
groom
and
leapt
nimbly
to
the
saddle
after
them
roared
albemarle
and
the
constable
with
two
of
his
men
made
a
dash
for
the
gateway
to
raise
the
hue
and
cry
whilst
the
militiamen
watched
them
in
stupid
inactive
wonder
damnation
mistress
thundered
the
duke
in
passion
hold
your
nag
hold
your
nag
woman
for
ruth
horse
had
become
unmanageable
and
was
caracoling
about
the
yard
between
the
men
and
the
gateway
in
such
a
manner
that
they
dared
not
attempt
to
win
past
her
you
have
scared
him
with
your
bellowing
she
panted
tugging
at
the
bridle
and
all
but
backed
into
the
constable
who
had
been
endeavouring
to
get
round
behind
her
the
beast
continued
its
wild
prancing
and
the
duke
abated
nothing
in
his
furious
profanity
until
suddenly
the
groom
having
relinquished
to
diana
the
reins
of
the
other
horse
sprang
to
ruth
assistance
and
caught
her
bridle
in
a
firm
grasp
which
brought
the
animal
to
a
standstill
you
fool
she
hissed
at
him
and
half
raised
her
whip
to
strike
but
checked
on
the
impulse
bethinking
her
in
time
that
after
all
what
the
poor
lad
had
done
he
had
done
thinking
her
distressed
the
constable
and
a
couple
of
his
fellows
won
through
others
were
rousing
the
stable
and
getting
to
horse
and
in
the
courtyard
all
was
bustle
and
commotion
meanwhile
however
wilding
and
trenchard
had
made
the
most
of
their
start
and
were
thundering
through
the
town
chapter
xii
at
the
ford
as
wilding
and
nick
trenchard
rode
through
taunton
streets
they
never
noticed
a
horseman
at
the
door
of
the
red
lion
inn
but
the
horseman
noticed
them
he
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
their
wild
approach
started
upon
recognizing
them
and
turned
in
his
saddle
as
they
swept
past
him
to
call
upon
them
excitedly
to
stop
hi
he
shouted
nick
trenchard
hi
wilding
then
seeing
that
they
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
heed
him
he
loosed
a
volley
of
oaths
wheeled
his
horse
about
drove
home
the
spurs
and
started
in
pursuit
out
of
the
town
he
followed
them
and
along
the
road
towards
walford
shouting
and
clamouring
at
first
afterwards
in
a
grim
and
angry
silence
now
despite
their
natural
anxiety
for
their
own
safety
wilding
and
trenchard
had
by
no
means
abandoned
their
project
of
taking
cover
by
the
ford
to
await
the
messenger
whom
albemarle
and
the
others
would
no
doubt
be
sending
to
whitehall
and
this
mad
fellow
thundering
after
them
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
mar
their
plan
as
they
reluctantly
passed
the
spot
they
had
marked
out
for
their
ambush
splashed
through
the
ford
and
breasted
the
rising
ground
beyond
they
took
counsel
they
determined
to
stand
and
meet
this
rash
pursuer
trenchard
calmly
opined
that
if
necessary
they
must
shoot
him
he
was
i
fear
a
fellow
at
bottom
although
it
is
true
he
justified
himself
now
by
pointing
out
that
this
was
no
time
to
hesitate
at
trifles
partly
because
they
talked
and
partly
because
the
gradient
was
steep
and
their
horses
needed
breathing
they
slackened
rein
and
the
horseman
behind
them
came
tearing
through
the
water
of
the
ford
and
lessened
the
distance
considerably
in
the
next
few
minutes
he
bethought
him
of
using
his
lungs
once
more
hi
wilding
hold
damn
you
he
curses
you
in
a
most
intimate
manner
quoth
trenchard
wilding
reined
in
and
turned
in
the
saddle
his
voice
has
a
familiar
sound
said
he
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
down
the
slope
at
the
pursuer
who
came
on
crouching
low
upon
the
withers
of
his
goaded
beast
wait
the
fellow
shouted
i
have
news
news
for
you
it
vallancey
cried
wilding
suddenly
trenchard
too
had
drawn
rein
and
was
looking
behind
him
instead
of
expressing
relief
at
the
discovery
that
this
was
not
an
enemy
he
swore
at
the
trouble
to
which
they
had
so
needlessly
put
themselves
and
he
was
still
at
his
vituperations
when
vallancey
came
up
with
them
red
in
the
face
and
very
angry
cursing
them
roundly
for
the
folly
of
their
mad
career
and
for
not
having
stopped
when
he
bade
them
it
was
no
doubt
discourteous
said
wilding
but
we
took
you
for
some
friend
of
the
are
they
after
you
quoth
vallancey
his
face
of
a
sudden
very
startled
like
enough
said
trenchard
if
they
have
found
their
horses
forward
then
vallancey
urged
them
in
excitement
and
he
picked
up
his
reins
again
you
shall
hear
my
news
as
we
not
so
said
trenchard
we
have
business
here
down
yonder
at
the
business
what
business
they
told
him
and
scarce
had
they
got
the
words
out
than
he
cut
in
impatiently
that
no
matter
now
not
yet
perhaps
said
wilding
but
it
will
be
if
that
letter
gets
to
odso
was
the
impatient
retort
there
other
news
travelling
to
whitehall
that
will
make
of
this
and
belike
it
well
on
its
way
there
what
news
is
that
asked
trenchard
vallancey
told
them
the
duke
has
landed
he
came
ashore
this
morning
at
the
duke
quoth
wilding
whilst
trenchard
merely
stared
what
duke
what
duke
lord
you
weary
me
what
dukes
be
there
the
duke
of
monmouth
monmouth
they
uttered
the
name
in
a
breath
but
is
this
really
true
asked
wilding
or
is
it
but
another
rumour
remember
the
letter
your
friends
intercepted
trenchard
bade
him
i
am
not
forgetting
it
said
wilding
it
no
rumour
vallancey
assured
them
i
was
at
white
lackington
three
hours
ago
when
the
news
came
to
george
speke
and
i
was
riding
to
carry
it
to
you
going
by
way
of
taunton
that
i
might
drop
word
of
it
for
our
friends
at
the
red
trenchard
needed
no
further
convincing
he
looked
accordingly
dismayed
but
wilding
found
it
still
almost
impossible
in
spite
of
what
already
he
had
learnt
to
credit
this
amazing
news
it
was
hard
to
believe
the
duke
of
monmouth
mad
enough
to
spoil
all
by
this
sudden
and
unheralded
precipitation
you
heard
the
news
at
white
lackington
said
he
slowly
who
carried
it
thither
there
were
two
messengers
answered
vallancey
with
restrained
impatience
and
they
were
heywood
dare
who
has
been
appointed
paymaster
to
the
duke
forces
and
wilding
was
observed
for
once
to
change
colour
he
gripped
vallancey
by
the
wrist
you
saw
them
he
demanded
and
his
voice
had
a
husky
unusual
sound
you
saw
them
with
these
two
eyes
answered
vallancey
and
i
spoke
with
it
was
true
then
there
was
no
room
for
further
doubt
wilding
looked
at
trenchard
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
a
wry
face
i
never
thought
but
that
we
were
working
in
the
service
of
a
hairbrain
said
he
contemptuously
vallancey
proceeded
to
details
dare
and
chamberlain
he
informed
them
came
off
the
duke
own
frigate
at
daybreak
they
were
put
ashore
at
seatown
and
they
rode
straight
to
speke
with
the
news
returning
afterwards
to
what
men
has
the
duke
with
him
did
you
learn
asked
wilding
not
more
than
a
hundred
or
so
from
what
dare
told
a
hundred
god
help
us
all
and
is
england
to
be
conquered
with
a
hundred
men
oh
this
is
midsummer
he
counts
on
all
true
protestants
to
flock
to
his
banner
put
in
trenchard
and
it
was
not
plain
whether
he
expressed
a
fact
or
sneered
at
one
does
he
bring
money
and
arms
at
least
asked
wilding
i
did
not
ask
answered
vallancey
but
dare
told
us
that
three
vessels
had
come
over
so
that
it
is
to
be
supposed
he
brings
some
manner
of
provision
with
it
is
to
be
hoped
so
vallancey
but
hardly
to
be
supposed
quoth
trenchard
and
then
he
touched
wilding
on
the
arm
and
pointed
with
his
whip
across
the
fields
towards
taunton
a
cloud
of
dust
was
rising
from
between
tall
hedges
where
ran
the
road
i
think
it
were
wise
to
be
moving
at
least
this
sudden
landing
of
james
scott
relieves
my
mind
in
the
matter
of
that
wilding
having
taken
a
look
at
the
floating
dust
that
announced
the
oncoming
of
their
pursuers
was
now
lost
in
thought
vallancey
who
beyond
excitement
at
the
news
of
which
he
was
the
bearer
seemed
to
have
no
opinion
of
his
own
as
to
the
wisdom
or
folly
of
the
duke
sudden
arrival
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
these
two
men
whom
he
had
known
as
the
prime
secret
agents
in
the
west
and
waited
trenchard
moved
his
horse
a
few
paces
nearer
the
hedge
whither
now
anthony
he
asked
suddenly
you
may
ask
indeed
exclaimed
wilding
and
his
voice
was
as
bitter
as
ever
trenchard
had
heard
it
heart
we
are
in
it
now
we
had
best
make
for
lyme
if
only
that
we
may
attempt
to
persuade
this
boy
to
ship
back
to
holland
again
and
ship
ourselves
with
there
sense
in
you
at
last
grumbled
trenchard
but
i
misdoubt
me
he
turn
back
after
having
come
so
far
have
you
any
money
he
asked
he
could
be
very
practical
at
times
a
guinea
or
two
but
i
can
get
money
at
and
how
do
you
propose
to
reach
ilminster
with
these
gentlemen
by
way
of
cutting
us
off
we
double
back
as
far
as
the
said
wilding
promptly
and
strike
south
over
swell
hill
for
hatch
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
do
it
easily
and
have
little
fear
of
being
followed
they
naturally
take
it
we
have
made
for
they
acted
on
the
suggestion
there
and
then
vallancey
going
with
them
for
his
task
was
now
accomplished
and
he
was
all
eager
to
get
to
lyme
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
protestant
duke
they
rode
hard
as
wilding
had
said
they
must
and
they
reached
the
junction
of
the
roads
before
their
pursuers
hove
in
sight
here
wilding
suddenly
detained
them
again
the
road
ahead
of
them
ran
straight
for
almost
a
mile
so
that
if
they
took
it
now
they
were
almost
sure
to
be
seen
presently
by
the
messengers
on
their
right
a
thickly
grown
coppice
stretched
from
the
road
to
the
stream
that
babbled
in
the
hollow
he
gave
it
as
his
advice
that
they
should
lie
hidden
there
until
those
who
hunted
them
should
have
gone
by
obviously
that
was
the
only
plan
and
his
companions
instantly
adopted
it
they
found
a
way
through
a
gate
into
an
adjacent
field
and
from
this
they
gained
the
shelter
of
the
trees
trenchard
neglectful
of
his
finery
and
oblivious
of
the
ubiquitous
brambles
left
his
horse
in
vallancey
care
and
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
thicket
that
he
might
take
a
peep
at
the
pursuers
they
came
up
very
soon
six
militiamen
in
lobster
coats
with
yellow
facings
and
a
sergeant
which
was
what
trenchard
might
have
expected
there
was
however
something
else
that
trenchard
did
not
expect
something
that
afforded
him
considerable
surprise
at
the
head
of
the
party
rode
sir
rowland
blake
obviously
leading
it
and
with
him
was
richard
westmacott
amongst
them
went
a
man
in
grey
clothes
whom
trenchard
rightly
conjectured
to
be
the
messenger
riding
for
whitehall
he
thought
with
a
smile
of
what
a
handful
he
and
wilding
would
have
had
had
they
waited
to
rob
that
messenger
of
the
incriminating
letter
that
he
bore
then
he
checked
his
smile
to
consider
again
how
sir
rowland
blake
came
to
head
that
party
he
abandoned
the
problem
as
the
little
troop
swept
unhesitatingly
round
to
the
left
and
went
pounding
along
the
road
that
led
northwards
to
bridgwater
clearly
never
doubting
which
way
their
quarry
had
sped
as
for
sir
rowland
blake
connection
with
this
pursuit
the
town
gallant
had
by
his
earnestness
not
only
convinced
colonel
luttrell
of
his
loyalty
and
devotion
to
king
james
but
had
actually
gone
so
far
as
to
beg
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
prove
that
same
loyalty
by
leading
the
soldiers
to
the
capture
of
those
traitors
wilding
and
trenchard
from
his
knowledge
of
their
haunts
he
was
confident
he
assured
colonel
luttrell
that
he
could
be
of
service
to
the
king
in
this
matter
the
fierce
sincerity
of
his
purpose
shone
through
his
words
luttrell
caught
the
accent
of
hate
in
sir
tense
voice
and
being
a
shrewd
man
he
saw
that
if
wilding
was
to
be
taken
an
enemy
would
surely
be
the
best
pursuer
to
accomplish
it
so
he
prevailed
and
gave
him
the
trust
he
sought
in
spite
of
expressed
reluctance
and
never
did
bloodhound
set
out
more
relentlessly
purposeful
upon
a
scent
than
did
sir
rowland
follow
now
in
what
he
believed
to
be
the
track
of
this
man
who
stood
between
him
and
ruth
westmacott
until
ruth
was
widowed
sir
rowland
hopes
of
her
must
lie
fallow
and
so
it
was
with
a
zest
that
he
flung
himself
into
the
task
of
widowing
her
as
the
party
passed
out
of
view
round
the
angle
of
the
white
road
trenchard
made
his
way
back
to
wilding
to
tell
him
what
he
had
seen
and
to
lay
before
him
for
his
enucleation
the
problem
of
blake
being
the
leader
of
it
but
wilding
thought
little
of
blake
and
cared
little
of
what
he
might
be
the
leader
we
stay
here
said
he
until
they
have
passed
the
crest
of
the
this
trenchard
told
him
was
his
own
purpose
for
to
leave
their
concealment
earlier
would
be
to
reveal
themselves
to
any
of
the
troopers
who
might
happen
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
and
so
they
waited
some
ten
minutes
or
so
and
then
walked
their
horses
slowly
and
carefully
forward
through
the
trees
towards
the
road
wilding
was
alongside
and
slightly
ahead
of
trenchard
vallancey
followed
close
upon
their
tails
suddenly
as
wilding
was
about
to
put
his
mare
at
the
low
stone
wall
trenchard
leaned
forward
and
caught
his
bridle
ss
he
hissed
horses
and
now
that
they
halted
they
heard
the
hoofbeats
clear
and
close
at
hand
the
crackling
of
undergrowth
and
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
through
which
they
had
thrust
their
passage
had
deafened
their
ears
to
other
sounds
until
this
moment
they
checked
and
waited
where
they
stood
barely
screened
by
the
few
boughs
that
still
might
intervene
between
them
and
the
open
not
daring
to
advance
and
not
daring
to
retreat
lest
their
movements
should
draw
attention
to
themselves
they
remained
absolutely
still
scarcely
breathing
their
only
hope
being
that
if
these
who
came
should
chance
to
be
enemies
they
might
ride
on
without
looking
to
right
or
left
it
was
so
slender
a
hope
that
wilding
looked
to
the
priming
of
his
pistols
whilst
trenchard
who
had
none
loosened
his
sword
in
its
scabbard
nearer
came
the
riders
there
are
not
more
than
three
whispered
trenchard
who
had
been
listening
intently
and
wilding
nodded
but
said
nothing
another
moment
and
the
little
party
was
abreast
of
those
watchers
a
dark
brown
flashed
into
their
line
of
vision
and
a
blue
one
laced
with
gold
at
sight
of
the
first
wilding
eyelids
flickered
he
had
recognized
it
for
ruth
with
whom
rode
diana
whilst
some
twenty
paces
or
so
behind
came
jerry
the
groom
they
were
returning
to
bridgwater
they
came
along
looking
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
as
the
three
men
had
hoped
they
would
and
they
were
all
but
past
when
suddenly
wilding
gave
his
roan
a
touch
of
the
spur
and
bounded
forward
diana
horse
swerved
so
that
it
nearly
threw
her
ruth
slightly
ahead
reined
in
at
once
so
too
did
the
groom
in
the
rear
and
so
violently
in
his
sudden
fear
of
highwaymen
that
he
brought
his
horse
on
to
its
hind
legs
and
had
it
prancing
and
rearing
madly
about
the
road
so
that
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
his
seat
ruth
looked
round
as
wilding
voice
greeted
her
mistress
wilding
he
called
to
her
a
moment
if
i
may
detain
you
have
eluded
them
she
cried
entirely
off
her
guard
in
her
surprise
at
seeing
him
and
there
echoed
through
her
words
a
note
of
genuine
gladness
that
almost
disconcerted
her
husband
for
a
moment
the
next
instant
a
crimson
flush
overspread
her
pale
face
and
her
eyes
were
veiled
from
him
vexation
in
her
heart
at
having
betrayed
the
lively
satisfaction
it
afforded
her
to
see
him
safe
when
she
feared
him
captured
already
or
at
least
upon
the
point
of
capture
she
had
admired
him
almost
unconsciously
for
his
daring
at
the
town
hall
that
day
when
his
strong
calm
had
stood
out
in
such
sharp
contrast
to
the
fluster
and
excitement
of
the
men
about
him
of
them
all
indeed
it
had
seemed
to
her
in
those
stressful
moments
that
he
was
the
only
man
and
she
was
although
she
did
not
realize
it
in
danger
of
being
proud
of
him
then
again
the
thing
he
had
done
he
had
come
deliberately
to
thrust
his
head
into
the
lion
maw
that
he
might
save
her
brother
it
was
possible
that
he
had
done
it
in
answer
to
the
entreaties
which
she
had
earlier
feared
she
had
poured
into
deaf
ears
or
it
was
possible
that
he
had
done
it
spurred
by
his
sense
of
right
and
justice
which
would
not
permit
him
to
allow
another
to
suffer
in
his
stead
however
much
that
other
might
be
caught
in
the
very
toils
that
he
had
prepared
for
wilding
himself
her
admiration
then
was
swelled
by
gratitude
and
it
was
a
compound
of
these
that
had
urged
her
to
hinder
the
from
winning
past
her
until
he
and
trenchard
should
have
got
well
away
afterwards
when
with
diana
and
her
groom
on
a
horse
which
sir
edward
phelips
insisted
upon
lending
them
she
rode
homeward
from
taunton
there
was
diana
to
keep
alive
the
spark
of
kindness
that
glowed
at
last
for
wilding
in
ruth
breast
miss
horton
extolled
his
bravery
his
chivalry
his
nobility
and
ended
by
expressing
her
envy
of
ruth
that
she
should
have
won
such
a
man
amongst
men
for
her
husband
and
wondered
what
it
might
be
that
kept
ruth
from
claiming
him
for
her
own
as
was
her
right
ruth
had
answered
little
but
she
had
ridden
very
thoughtful
there
was
that
in
the
past
she
found
it
hard
to
forgive
wilding
and
yet
she
would
now
have
welcomed
an
opportunity
of
thanking
him
for
what
he
had
done
of
expressing
to
him
something
of
the
respect
he
had
won
in
her
eyes
by
his
act
of
to
save
her
brother
this
chance
it
seemed
was
given
her
for
there
he
stood
with
head
bared
before
her
and
already
she
thought
no
longer
of
seizing
the
chance
vexed
as
she
was
at
having
been
surprised
into
a
betrayal
of
feelings
whose
warmth
she
had
until
that
moment
scarce
estimated
in
answer
to
her
cry
of
you
have
eluded
them
he
waved
a
hand
towards
the
rising
ground
and
the
road
to
bridgwater
they
passed
that
way
but
a
few
moments
since
said
he
and
by
the
rate
at
which
they
were
travelling
they
should
be
nearing
newton
by
now
in
their
great
haste
to
catch
me
they
could
not
pause
to
look
for
me
so
close
at
hand
he
added
with
a
smile
and
for
that
i
am
she
sat
her
horse
and
answered
nothing
which
threw
her
cousin
out
of
all
patience
with
her
come
jerry
diana
called
to
the
groom
we
will
walk
our
horses
up
the
you
are
very
good
madam
said
wilding
and
he
bowed
to
the
withers
of
his
roan
ruth
said
nothing
expressed
neither
approval
nor
disapproval
of
withdrawal
and
the
latter
with
a
word
of
greeting
to
wilding
went
ahead
followed
by
jerry
who
had
regained
control
by
now
of
the
beast
he
bestrode
wilding
watched
them
until
they
turned
the
corner
then
he
walked
his
mare
slowly
forward
until
he
was
alongside
ruth
before
i
go
said
he
there
is
something
i
should
like
to
his
dark
eyes
were
sombre
his
manner
betrayed
some
hesitation
the
diffidence
of
his
tone
proved
startling
to
her
by
virtue
of
its
unusualness
what
might
it
portend
she
wondered
and
sought
with
grave
eyes
to
read
his
baffling
countenance
and
then
a
wild
alarm
swept
into
her
and
shook
her
spirit
in
its
grip
there
was
something
of
which
until
this
moment
she
had
not
thought
something
connected
with
the
fateful
matter
of
that
letter
it
had
stood
as
a
barrier
between
them
her
buckler
her
sole
defence
against
him
it
had
been
to
her
what
its
sting
is
to
the
bee
a
thing
which
if
once
used
in
is
not
indeed
that
she
had
used
it
as
her
sting
it
had
been
forced
from
her
by
the
machinations
of
trenchard
but
used
it
had
been
and
was
done
with
she
had
it
no
longer
that
with
it
she
might
hold
him
in
defiance
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
was
no
longer
in
case
to
invoke
the
law
her
face
grew
stony
a
dry
glitter
came
to
her
blue
eyes
she
cast
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
diana
and
her
servant
wilding
observed
it
and
read
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
indeed
it
was
not
to
be
mistaken
no
more
than
what
is
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
recruit
who
looks
behind
him
in
the
act
of
charging
his
lips
half
smiled
of
what
are
you
afraid
he
asked
her
i
am
not
afraid
she
answered
in
husky
accents
that
belied
her
perhaps
to
reassure
her
perhaps
because
he
thought
of
his
companions
lurking
in
the
thicket
and
cared
not
to
have
them
for
his
audience
he
suggested
they
should
go
a
little
way
in
the
direction
her
cousin
had
taken
she
wheeled
her
horse
and
side
by
side
they
ambled
up
the
dusty
road
the
thing
i
have
to
tell
you
said
he
presently
concerns
does
it
concern
me
she
asked
him
coldly
and
her
coolness
was
urged
partly
by
her
newborn
fears
partly
to
counterbalance
such
impression
as
her
illjudged
show
of
gladness
at
his
safety
might
have
made
upon
his
mind
he
flashed
her
a
sidelong
glance
the
long
white
fingers
of
his
right
hand
toying
thoughtfully
with
a
ringlet
of
the
dark
brown
hair
that
fell
upon
the
shoulders
of
his
scarlet
coat
surely
madam
he
answered
dryly
what
concerns
a
man
may
well
concern
his
she
bowed
her
head
her
eyes
upon
the
road
before
her
true
said
she
her
voice
expressionless
i
had
he
reined
in
and
turned
to
look
at
her
her
horse
moved
on
a
pace
or
two
then
came
to
a
halt
apparently
of
its
own
accord
i
do
protest
said
he
you
treat
me
less
kindly
than
i
he
urged
his
mare
forward
until
he
had
come
up
with
her
again
and
then
drew
rein
once
more
i
think
that
i
may
lay
some
claim
to
at
least
your
gratitude
for
what
i
did
it
is
my
inclination
to
be
grateful
said
she
she
was
very
wary
of
him
forgive
me
if
i
am
still
but
of
what
he
cried
a
thought
impatiently
of
you
what
ends
did
you
seek
to
serve
was
it
to
save
richard
that
you
came
unless
you
think
that
it
was
to
save
blake
he
said
ironically
what
other
ends
do
you
conceive
i
could
have
served
she
made
him
no
answer
and
so
he
resumed
after
a
pause
i
rode
to
taunton
to
serve
you
for
two
reasons
because
you
asked
me
and
because
i
would
have
no
innocent
men
suffer
in
my
stead
not
even
though
as
these
men
they
were
but
caught
in
their
own
toils
hoist
with
the
petard
they
had
charged
for
me
beyond
these
two
motives
i
had
no
other
thought
in
ruining
ruining
yourself
she
cried
yes
it
was
true
but
she
had
not
thought
of
it
until
this
moment
there
had
been
so
much
to
think
of
is
it
not
ruin
to
be
outlawed
to
have
a
price
set
upon
your
head
as
will
no
doubt
a
price
be
set
on
mine
when
albemarle
messenger
shall
have
reached
whitehall
is
it
not
ruin
to
have
my
lands
and
all
i
own
made
forfeit
to
the
state
to
find
myself
a
beggar
hunted
and
proscribed
forgive
me
that
i
harass
you
with
this
catalogue
of
my
misfortunes
you
say
no
doubt
that
i
have
brought
them
upon
myself
by
compelling
you
against
your
will
to
marry
me
i
not
deny
that
it
is
in
my
mind
said
she
and
of
set
purpose
stifled
pity
he
sighed
and
looked
at
her
again
but
she
would
not
meet
his
eye
else
its
whimsical
expression
might
have
intrigued
her
can
you
deny
my
magnanimity
i
wonder
said
he
and
spoke
almost
as
one
amused
all
i
had
i
sacrificed
to
do
your
will
to
save
your
brother
from
the
snare
of
his
own
contriving
against
me
i
wonder
do
you
yet
realize
how
much
i
sacrificed
at
taunton
i
wonder
and
he
paused
looking
at
her
and
waiting
for
some
word
from
her
but
she
had
none
for
him
clearly
you
do
not
else
i
think
you
would
show
me
if
only
a
pretence
of
she
was
looking
at
him
at
last
her
eyes
less
hard
they
seemed
to
ask
him
to
explain
when
you
came
this
morning
with
the
tale
of
how
the
tables
had
been
turned
upon
your
brother
of
how
he
was
caught
in
his
own
springe
and
the
letter
found
in
his
keeping
was
before
the
king
folk
at
taunton
with
every
appearance
of
having
been
addressed
to
him
and
not
a
tittle
of
evidence
to
show
that
it
had
been
meant
for
me
do
you
know
what
news
it
was
you
brought
me
he
paused
a
second
looking
at
her
from
narrowing
eyes
then
he
answered
his
own
question
you
brought
me
the
news
that
you
were
mine
to
take
i
pleased
whilst
that
letter
was
in
your
hands
it
gave
you
the
power
to
make
me
your
obedient
slave
you
might
blow
upon
me
as
you
listed
whilst
you
held
it
and
i
was
a
vane
that
must
turn
to
your
blowing
for
my
honour
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
in
which
i
worked
through
no
rashness
of
mine
must
that
letter
come
into
the
hands
of
the
friends
else
was
i
dishonoured
it
was
an
effective
barrier
between
us
so
long
as
you
possessed
that
letter
you
might
pipe
as
you
pleased
and
i
must
dance
to
the
tune
you
set
and
then
this
morning
what
you
came
to
tell
me
was
that
things
were
changed
that
it
was
mine
to
call
the
tune
had
i
had
the
strength
to
be
a
villain
you
had
been
mine
now
and
your
brother
and
sir
rowland
might
have
hanged
on
the
rope
of
their
own
she
looked
at
him
in
a
startled
almost
shamefaced
manner
this
was
an
aspect
of
the
case
she
had
not
considered
you
realize
it
i
see
he
said
and
smiled
wistfully
then
perhaps
you
realize
why
you
found
me
so
unwilling
to
do
the
thing
you
craved
having
treated
me
ungenerously
you
came
to
cast
yourself
upon
my
generosity
asking
me
though
i
scarcely
think
you
understood
to
beggar
myself
of
life
itself
with
all
it
held
for
me
god
knows
i
make
no
pretence
to
virtue
and
yet
i
think
i
had
been
something
more
than
human
had
i
not
refused
you
and
the
bargain
you
offered
a
bargain
that
you
would
never
be
called
upon
to
fulfil
if
i
did
the
thing
you
at
last
she
interrupted
him
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
had
not
thought
of
it
she
cried
it
was
a
piteous
wail
that
broke
from
her
i
swear
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
was
all
distraught
for
poor
richard
sake
oh
wilding
she
turned
to
him
holding
out
a
hand
her
eyes
shone
filmed
with
moisture
i
shall
have
a
kindness
for
you
all
my
days
for
your
generosity
it
was
lamentably
weak
far
from
the
hot
expressions
which
she
forced
it
to
replace
yes
i
was
generous
he
admitted
we
will
move
on
as
far
as
the
again
they
ambled
gently
forward
up
the
slope
from
the
ford
diana
and
jerry
were
slowly
climbing
not
another
human
being
was
in
sight
ahead
or
behind
them
after
you
left
me
he
continued
your
memory
and
your
entreaties
lingered
with
me
i
gave
the
matter
of
our
position
thought
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
was
monstrously
i
loved
you
ruth
i
needed
you
and
you
disdained
me
my
love
was
master
of
me
but
your
disdain
it
was
transmuted
he
checked
the
passion
that
was
vibrating
in
his
voice
and
resumed
after
a
pause
in
the
calm
slow
tones
soft
and
musical
that
were
his
own
there
is
scarce
the
need
for
so
much
recapitulation
when
the
power
was
mine
i
bent
you
unfairly
to
my
will
you
did
as
much
by
me
when
the
power
suddenly
became
yours
it
was
a
strange
war
between
us
and
i
accepted
its
conditions
when
the
power
was
mine
again
mine
to
bring
you
at
last
to
subjection
behold
i
have
capitulated
at
your
bidding
and
all
that
i
held
including
your
own
self
have
i
relinquished
it
is
perhaps
fitting
haply
i
am
punished
for
having
wed
you
before
i
had
wooed
again
his
tone
changed
it
grew
more
cold
more
i
rode
this
way
a
little
while
ago
a
hunted
man
my
only
hope
to
reach
home
and
collect
what
moneys
and
valuables
i
could
carry
and
make
for
the
coast
to
find
a
vessel
bound
for
holland
i
have
been
engaged
as
you
know
in
stirring
up
rebellion
to
check
the
iniquities
and
persecutions
that
are
toward
in
a
land
i
love
i
not
weary
you
with
details
time
was
needed
for
this
as
for
all
things
and
by
next
spring
perhaps
had
matters
gone
well
this
vineyard
that
so
carefully
and
secretly
i
have
been
tending
would
have
been
maybe
in
condition
to
bear
fruit
even
now
in
the
hour
of
my
flight
i
learn
that
others
have
come
to
force
this
delicate
growth
into
sudden
maturity
there
soon
ripe
soon
rotten
the
duke
of
monmouth
has
landed
at
lyme
this
morning
i
am
riding
to
to
what
end
she
cried
and
he
saw
in
her
face
a
dismay
that
amounted
almost
to
fear
and
he
wondered
was
it
for
him
to
place
my
sword
at
his
service
were
i
not
encompassed
by
this
ruin
i
should
not
have
stirred
a
foot
in
that
direction
so
rash
so
foredoomed
to
failure
is
this
invasion
as
it
is
he
shrugged
and
laughed
it
is
the
only
hope
all
forlorn
though
it
may
be
for
the
trammels
she
had
imposed
upon
her
soul
fell
away
at
that
like
bonds
of
cobweb
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
wrists
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
her
lips
quivered
anthony
forgive
me
she
besought
him
he
trembled
under
her
touch
under
the
caress
of
her
voice
and
at
the
sound
of
his
name
for
the
first
time
upon
her
lips
what
have
i
to
forgive
he
asked
the
thing
that
i
did
in
the
matter
of
that
you
poor
child
said
he
smiling
gently
upon
her
you
did
it
in
yet
say
that
you
forgive
me
say
it
before
you
go
she
begged
him
he
considered
her
gravely
a
moment
to
what
end
he
asked
do
you
imagine
that
i
have
talked
so
much
to
the
end
that
i
might
show
you
that
however
i
may
have
wronged
you
i
have
at
the
last
made
some
amends
and
that
for
the
sake
of
this
the
truest
proof
of
penitence
i
may
have
your
forgiveness
ere
i
she
was
weeping
softly
it
was
an
ill
day
on
which
we
met
she
sighed
for
you
nay
for
you
we
say
for
both
of
us
then
he
compromised
see
ruth
your
cousin
grows
weary
and
i
have
a
couple
of
comrades
who
are
no
doubt
impatient
to
be
gone
it
may
not
be
good
for
us
to
tarry
in
these
parts
some
amends
i
have
made
but
there
is
one
crowning
wrong
which
i
have
done
you
for
which
there
is
but
one
amend
to
he
paused
he
steadied
himself
before
continuing
in
his
attempt
to
render
his
voice
cold
and
commonplace
he
went
near
to
achieving
harshness
it
may
be
that
this
crackbrained
rebellion
of
which
the
torch
is
already
alight
will
if
it
does
no
other
good
in
england
at
least
make
a
widow
of
you
when
that
has
come
to
pass
when
i
have
thus
repaired
the
wrong
i
did
you
i
hope
you
bear
me
as
kindly
as
may
be
in
your
thought
my
ruth
i
would
you
might
have
loved
me
i
sought
to
force
he
smiled
ever
so
wanly
perhaps
that
was
my
mistake
it
is
an
ill
thing
to
eat
one
hay
while
it
is
he
raised
to
his
lips
the
little
gloved
hand
that
still
rested
on
his
wrist
god
keep
you
ruth
he
murmured
she
sought
to
answer
him
but
something
choked
her
a
sob
was
all
she
achieved
had
he
caught
her
to
him
in
that
moment
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
she
had
yielded
perhaps
he
knew
it
and
knowing
it
kept
the
tighter
rein
upon
desire
she
was
as
metal
molten
in
the
crucible
to
be
moulded
by
his
craftsman
hands
into
any
pattern
that
he
chose
but
the
crucible
was
the
crucible
of
pity
not
of
love
that
too
he
knew
and
knowing
it
forbore
he
dropped
her
hand
doffed
his
hat
and
wheeling
his
horse
about
touched
it
with
the
spur
and
rode
back
towards
the
thicket
where
his
friends
awaited
him
as
he
left
her
she
too
wheeled
about
as
if
to
follow
him
she
strove
to
command
her
voice
that
she
might
recall
him
but
at
that
same
moment
trenchard
hearing
his
returning
hoofs
thrust
out
into
the
road
with
vallancey
following
at
his
heels
the
old
player
harsh
voice
reached
her
where
she
stood
and
it
was
querulous
with
impatience
what
a
plague
do
you
mean
dallying
here
at
such
a
time
anthony
he
cried
to
which
vallancey
added
in
god
name
let
us
push
at
that
she
checked
her
impulse
it
may
even
be
that
she
mistrusted
it
she
paused
lingering
undecided
for
an
instant
then
turning
her
horse
once
more
she
ambled
up
the
slope
to
rejoin

pro

et
libertate
the
evening
was
far
advanced
when
wilding
and
his
two
companions
descended
to
uplyme
common
from
the
heights
whence
as
they
rode
they
had
commanded
a
clear
view
of
the
fair
valley
of
the
axe
lying
now
under
a
thin
opalescent
veil
of
evening
mist
they
had
paused
at
ilminster
for
fresh
horses
and
there
wilding
had
paid
a
visit
to
one
of
his
agents
from
whom
he
had
procured
a
hundred
guineas
thence
they
had
come
south
at
a
sharp
pace
and
with
little
said
wilding
was
moody
and
thoughtful
filled
with
chagrin
at
this
unconscionable
rashness
of
the
man
upon
whom
all
his
hopes
were
centred
as
they
cantered
briskly
across
uplyme
common
in
the
twilight
they
passed
several
bodies
of
countrymen
all
heading
for
the
town
and
one
group
sent
up
a
shout
of
god
save
the
protestant
duke
as
they
rode
past
him
amen
to
that
muttered
wilding
grimly
for
i
am
afraid
that
no
man
in
the
narrow
lane
by
hay
farm
a
horseman
going
in
the
opposite
direction
passed
them
at
the
gallop
but
they
had
met
several
such
since
leaving
ilminster
for
indeed
the
news
was
spreading
fast
and
the
whole
countryside
was
alive
with
messengers
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
but
all
hurrying
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
their
haste
they
made
their
way
to
the
where
declaration
that
remarkable
manifesto
from
the
pen
of
ferguson
had
been
read
some
hours
before
thence
having
ascertained
where
his
grace
was
lodged
they
made
their
way
to
the
george
inn
in
coombe
street
they
found
the
crowd
so
dense
that
they
could
but
with
difficulty
open
out
a
way
for
their
horses
through
the
human
press
not
a
window
but
was
open
and
thronged
with
mostly
women
indeed
for
the
men
were
in
the
press
below
on
every
hand
resounded
the
cries
of
a
monmouth
a
monmouth
the
protestant
religion
religion
and
liberty
which
latter
were
the
words
inscribed
on
the
standard
monmouth
had
set
up
that
evening
on
the
church
cliffs
in
truth
wilding
was
amazed
at
what
he
saw
and
said
as
much
to
trenchard
so
pessimistic
had
been
his
outlook
that
he
had
almost
expected
to
find
the
rebellion
snuffed
out
by
the
time
they
reached
what
had
the
authorities
been
about
that
they
had
permitted
monmouth
to
come
ashore
or
had
vallancey
information
been
wrong
in
the
matter
of
the
numbers
that
accompanied
the
protestant
champion
wilding
red
coat
attracted
some
attention
in
the
dusk
its
colour
was
almost
all
that
could
be
discerned
of
it
here
a
militia
captain
for
the
duke
cried
one
and
others
took
up
the
cry
and
if
it
did
nothing
else
it
opened
a
way
for
them
through
that
solid
human
mass
and
permitted
them
to
win
through
to
the
yard
of
the
george
inn
they
found
the
spacious
quadrangle
thronged
with
men
armed
and
unarmed
and
on
the
steps
stood
a
tall
soldierly
man
his
hat
rakishly
cocked
about
whom
a
crowd
of
townsmen
and
country
fellows
were
pressing
with
insistence
at
a
glance
wilding
recognized
captain
venner
raised
to
the
rank
of
colonel
by
monmouth
on
the
way
from
holland
trenchard
dismounted
and
taking
a
distracted
by
the
arm
bade
him
see
to
their
horses
the
fellow
endeavoured
to
swing
himself
free
of
the
other
tenacious
grasp
let
me
go
he
cried
i
am
for
the
duke
and
so
are
we
my
fine
rebel
answered
trenchard
holding
fast
let
me
go
the
lout
insisted
i
am
going
to
and
so
you
shall
when
you
have
stabled
our
nags
see
to
him
vallancey
he
is
brainsick
with
the
fumes
of
the
fellow
protested
but
trenchard
way
was
brisk
and
short
and
so
protesting
still
he
led
away
their
cattle
in
the
end
vallancey
going
with
him
to
see
that
he
performed
this
last
duty
as
a
ere
he
too
became
a
champion
militant
of
the
protestant
cause
trenchard
sped
after
wilding
who
was
elbowing
his
way
through
the
yokels
about
the
steps
the
glare
of
a
newly
lighted
lamp
from
the
doorway
fell
full
upon
his
long
white
face
as
he
advanced
and
venner
espied
and
recognized
him
mr
wilding
he
cried
and
there
was
a
glad
ring
in
his
voice
for
though
cobblers
tailors
deserters
from
the
militia
and
shuffling
yokels
had
been
coming
in
in
numbers
during
the
past
few
hours
since
the
declaration
had
been
read
this
was
the
first
gentleman
that
arrived
to
welcome
monmouth
the
soldier
stretched
out
a
hand
to
grasp
the
newcomer
his
grace
will
see
you
this
instant
not
a
doubt
of
he
turned
and
called
down
the
passage
cragg
a
young
man
in
a
buff
coat
came
forward
and
to
him
venner
delivered
wilding
and
trenchard
that
he
might
announce
them
to
his
grace
in
the
room
that
had
been
set
apart
for
him
abovestairs
monmouth
still
sat
at
table
he
had
just
supped
with
but
an
indifferent
appetite
so
fevered
was
he
by
the
events
of
his
landing
he
was
excited
with
hope
inspired
by
the
readiness
with
which
the
men
of
lyme
and
its
neighbourhood
had
flocked
to
his
banner
and
fretted
by
anxiety
that
none
of
the
gentry
of
the
vicinity
should
yet
have
followed
the
example
of
the
meaner
folk
in
answer
to
the
messages
dispatched
at
dawn
from
seaton
the
board
at
which
he
sat
was
still
cumbered
with
some
glasses
and
platters
and
vestiges
of
his
repast
below
him
on
his
right
sat
ferguson
that
prince
of
plotters
very
busy
with
pen
and
ink
his
keen
face
almost
hidden
by
his
great
periwig
opposite
were
lord
grey
of
werke
and
andrew
fletcher
of
saltoun
whilst
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
table
barely
within
the
circle
of
candlelight
from
the
branch
on
the
polished
oak
was
nathaniel
wade
the
lawyer
who
had
fled
to
holland
on
account
of
his
alleged
complicity
in
the
rye
house
plot
and
was
now
returned
a
major
in
the
duke
service
erect
and
soldierly
of
figure
girt
with
a
great
sword
and
with
the
butt
of
a
pistol
protruding
from
his
belt
he
had
little
the
air
of
a
man
whose
methods
of
contention
were
forensic
you
understand
then
major
wade
his
grace
was
saying
his
voice
pleasant
and
musical
it
is
decided
that
the
guns
had
best
be
got
ashore
forthwith
and
wade
bowed
i
shall
set
about
it
at
once
your
grace
i
shall
not
want
for
help
have
i
your
grace
leave
to
go
monmouth
nodded
and
as
wade
passed
out
ensign
cragg
entered
to
announce
wilding
and
trenchard
the
duke
rose
to
his
feet
his
glance
suddenly
brightening
fletcher
and
grey
rose
with
him
ferguson
paid
no
heed
absorbed
in
his
task
which
he
industriously
continued
at
last
exclaimed
the
duke
admit
them
when
they
entered
wilding
coming
first
his
hat
under
his
arm
the
duke
sprang
to
meet
him
a
tall
young
figure
lithe
and
slender
as
a
blade
of
steel
and
of
a
steely
strength
for
all
his
slimness
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
purple
that
became
him
marvellously
well
and
on
his
breast
a
star
of
diamonds
flashed
and
smouldered
like
a
thing
of
fire
he
was
of
an
exceeding
beauty
of
face
wherein
he
mainly
favoured
that
bold
handsome
woman
that
was
his
mother
without
however
any
of
his
mother
insipidity
fine
eyes
a
good
nose
straight
and
slender
and
a
mouth
which
if
sensual
and
indicating
a
lack
of
strength
was
beautifully
shaped
his
chin
was
slightly
cleft
the
shape
of
his
face
a
delicate
oval
framed
now
in
the
waving
masses
of
his
brown
wig
some
likeness
to
his
late
majesty
was
also
discernible
in
spite
of
the
wart
out
of
which
his
uncle
james
made
so
much
capital
there
was
a
slight
flush
on
his
cheeks
an
added
lustre
in
his
eye
as
he
took
wilding
hand
and
shook
it
heartily
before
wilding
had
time
to
kiss
his
grace
you
are
late
he
said
but
there
was
no
reproach
in
his
voice
we
had
looked
to
find
you
here
when
we
came
ashore
you
had
my
letter
i
had
not
your
grace
answered
wilding
very
grave
it
was
stolen
cried
the
duke
and
behind
him
grey
pressed
forward
whilst
even
ferguson
paused
in
his
writing
to
raise
his
piercing
eyes
and
listen
it
is
no
matter
wilding
reassured
him
although
stolen
it
has
but
gone
to
whitehall
when
it
can
add
little
to
the
news
that
is
already
on
its
way
the
duke
laughed
softly
with
a
flash
of
white
teeth
and
looked
past
wilding
at
trenchard
some
of
the
light
faded
out
of
his
eyes
they
told
me
trenchard
he
began
when
wilding
half
turning
to
his
friend
explained
this
is
nicholas
trenchard
john
trenchard
cousin
i
bid
you
welcome
sir
said
the
duke
very
agreeably
and
i
trust
your
cousin
follows
alas
said
trenchard
my
cousin
is
in
france
and
in
a
few
brief
words
he
related
the
matter
of
john
trenchard
on
his
acquittal
and
the
trouble
there
had
been
connected
with
it
the
duke
received
the
news
in
silence
he
had
expected
good
support
from
old
speke
indeed
there
was
a
promise
that
when
he
came
john
trenchard
would
bring
fifteen
hundred
men
from
taunton
he
took
a
turn
in
the
room
deep
in
thought
and
there
was
a
pause
until
ferguson
rubbing
his
great
roman
nose
asked
suddenly
had
wilding
seen
the
declaration
wilding
had
not
and
thereupon
the
plotting
parson
who
was
proud
of
his
composition
would
have
read
it
to
him
there
and
then
but
that
grey
sourly
told
him
the
matter
would
keep
and
that
they
had
other
things
to
discuss
with
wilding
this
the
duke
himself
confirmed
stating
that
there
were
matters
on
which
he
would
be
glad
to
have
their
opinion
he
invited
the
newcomers
to
draw
chairs
to
the
table
glasses
were
called
for
and
a
couple
of
fresh
bottles
of
canary
went
round
the
board
the
talk
was
desultory
for
a
few
moments
whilst
wilding
and
trenchard
washed
the
dust
from
their
throats
then
monmouth
broke
the
ice
by
asking
them
bluntly
what
they
thought
of
his
coming
thus
earlier
than
was
at
first
agreed
wilding
never
hesitated
in
his
reply
frankly
your
grace
said
he
i
like
it
not
at
fletcher
looked
up
sharply
his
clear
intelligent
eyes
full
upon
wilding
calm
face
his
countenance
expressing
as
little
as
did
wilding
ferguson
seemed
slightly
taken
aback
grey
thick
lips
were
twisted
in
a
sneering
smile
faith
said
the
latter
with
elaborate
sarcasm
in
that
case
it
only
remains
for
us
to
ship
again
heave
anchor
and
back
to
it
is
what
i
should
advise
said
wilding
slowly
and
quietly
if
i
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
my
advice
being
he
had
a
calm
almost
apathetic
way
of
uttering
startling
things
which
rendered
them
doubly
startling
the
sneer
seemed
to
freeze
on
lord
grey
lips
fletcher
continued
to
stare
but
his
eyes
had
grown
more
round
ferguson
scowled
darkly
the
duke
boyish
face
it
was
still
very
youthful
despite
his
years
expressed
a
wondering
consternation
he
looked
at
wilding
and
from
wilding
to
the
others
and
his
glance
seemed
to
entreat
them
to
suggest
an
answer
to
him
it
was
grey
at
last
who
took
the
matter
up
you
shall
explain
your
meaning
sir
or
we
must
hold
you
a
traitor
he
exclaimed
king
james
does
that
already
answered
wilding
with
a
quiet
smile
d
mean
the
duke
of
york
rumbled
ferguson
scottish
accent
with
startling
suddenness
and
monmouth
nodded
approval
of
the
correction
if
ye
mean
that
bloody
papist
and
fratricide
it
were
well
so
to
speak
of
him
had
ye
read
the
declaration
but
fletcher
cropped
his
speech
in
he
was
ever
a
man
intolerant
of
irrelevancies
it
were
well
perhaps
said
he
his
accent
abundantly
proclaiming
him
a
fellow
countryman
of
ferguson
to
keep
to
the
matter
before
us
wilding
no
doubt
will
state
the
reasons
that
exist
or
that
he
fancies
may
exist
for
giving
advice
which
is
hardly
worthy
of
the
cause
to
which
he
stands
aye
fletcher
said
monmouth
there
is
sense
in
you
tell
us
what
is
in
your
mind
it
is
in
my
mind
your
grace
that
this
invasion
is
rash
premature
and
odds
life
cried
grey
and
he
swung
angrily
round
fully
to
face
the
duke
the
nostrils
of
his
heavy
nose
dilating
are
we
to
listen
to
this
milksop
prattle
nick
trenchard
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
cleared
his
throat
so
noisily
that
he
drew
all
eyes
to
himself
your
grace
wilding
pursued
his
air
calm
and
dignified
and
gathering
more
dignity
from
the
circumstance
that
he
proceeded
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
when
i
had
the
honour
of
conferring
with
you
at
the
hague
two
months
ago
it
was
agreed
that
you
should
spend
the
summer
in
sweden
away
from
politics
and
scheming
leaving
the
work
of
preparation
to
your
accredited
agents
here
that
work
i
have
been
slowly
but
surely
pushing
forward
it
was
not
to
be
hurried
men
of
position
are
not
to
be
won
over
in
a
day
men
with
anything
to
lose
need
some
guarantee
that
they
are
not
wantonly
casting
their
possessions
to
the
winds
by
next
spring
as
was
agreed
all
would
have
been
ready
delay
could
not
have
hurt
you
indeed
with
every
day
by
which
you
delayed
your
coming
you
did
good
service
to
your
cause
you
strengthened
its
prospects
of
success
for
every
day
the
people
burden
of
oppression
and
persecution
grows
more
heavy
and
the
people
temper
more
short
every
day
by
the
methods
that
he
is
pursuing
king
james
brings
himself
into
deeper
hatred
this
hatred
is
spreading
it
was
the
business
of
myself
and
those
others
to
help
it
on
until
from
the
cottage
of
the
ploughman
the
infection
of
anger
should
have
spread
to
the
mansion
of
the
squire
had
your
grace
but
given
me
time
as
i
entreated
you
and
as
you
promised
me
you
might
have
marched
to
whitehall
with
scarce
the
shedding
of
a
drop
of
blood
had
your
grace
but
waited
until
we
were
ready
england
would
have
so
trembled
at
your
landing
that
your
uncle
throne
would
have
toppled
over
the
shock
as
it
is
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
sighed
and
spread
his
hands
leaving
his
sentence
uncompleted
monmouth
sat
sobered
by
these
sober
words
the
intoxication
that
had
come
to
him
from
the
little
measure
of
success
that
had
attended
the
opening
of
the
listing
on
church
cliffs
deserted
him
now
he
saw
the
thing
stark
and
in
its
true
proportions
and
not
even
the
shouting
of
the
folk
in
the
streets
below
crying
his
name
and
acclaiming
him
their
champion
served
to
lighten
the
gloom
that
wilding
words
cast
like
a
cloud
over
his
volatile
heart
alas
poor
monmouth
he
was
ever
a
weathercock
and
even
as
wilding
words
seemed
to
strike
the
courage
out
of
him
so
did
grey
short
contemptuous
answer
restore
it
as
it
is
we
thrust
that
throne
over
with
our
hands
said
he
after
a
moment
pause
aye
cried
monmouth
we
do
it
god
helping
us
our
dependence
and
trust
is
in
the
lord
of
hosts
in
whose
name
we
go
forth
boomed
the
voice
of
ferguson
quoting
from
his
precious
declaration
the
lord
will
do
that
which
seemeth
good
unto
an
unanswerable
argument
said
wilding
smiling
but
the
lord
i
am
told
by
the
gentlemen
of
your
cloth
works
in
his
own
good
time
and
my
fears
are
all
lest
finding
us
unprepared
of
ourselves
the
lord
good
time
be
not
out
on
ye
sir
cried
ferguson
ye
want
for
reverence
common
sense
will
serve
us
better
at
the
moment
answered
wilding
with
a
touch
of
sharpness
he
turned
to
the
frowning
and
perplexed
duke
whose
mind
was
being
tossed
this
way
and
that
like
a
shuttlecock
upon
the
battledore
of
these
men
words
your
grace
he
said
forgive
me
that
i
speak
it
if
hear
it
you
will
or
forbid
me
to
say
it
if
your
resolve
is
unalterable
in
this
it
is
unalterable
answered
grey
for
the
duke
but
monmouth
gently
overruled
him
for
once
nevertheless
speak
by
all
means
wilding
whatever
you
may
say
you
need
have
no
fear
that
any
of
us
can
doubt
your
good
intentions
to
i
thank
your
grace
what
i
have
to
say
is
but
a
repetition
of
the
first
words
i
uttered
at
this
table
i
would
urge
your
grace
even
now
to
what
are
you
mad
it
was
lord
grey
who
asked
the
impatient
question
i
doubt
it
for
that
said
fletcher
slowly
i
am
not
so
sure
answered
wilding
but
i
am
sure
that
to
attempt
it
were
the
safer
course
the
surer
in
the
end
i
myself
may
not
linger
to
push
forward
the
task
of
stirring
up
the
people
for
i
am
already
something
more
than
under
suspicion
but
there
are
others
who
will
remain
to
carry
on
the
work
after
i
have
departed
with
your
grace
if
your
grace
thinks
well
from
the
continent
by
correspondence
we
can
mature
our
plans
in
a
twelvemonth
things
will
be
very
different
and
we
can
return
with
grey
shrugged
and
turned
his
shoulder
upon
wilding
but
said
no
word
there
was
silence
of
some
few
moments
andrew
fletcher
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
took
his
brow
in
his
great
bony
hand
wilding
words
seemed
an
echo
of
those
he
himself
had
spoken
a
week
or
two
ago
only
to
be
overruled
by
grey
who
swayed
the
duke
more
than
did
any
other
and
that
he
did
not
do
so
of
fell
purpose
and
seeking
deliberately
to
work
monmouth
ruin
no
man
will
ever
be
able
to
say
with
certainty
ferguson
rose
a
tall
spare
stooping
figure
and
smote
the
board
with
his
fist
it
is
a
good
cause
he
cried
and
god
will
not
leave
us
unless
we
leave
henry
the
seventh
landed
with
fewer
men
than
did
your
grace
said
grey
and
he
true
put
in
fletcher
but
henry
the
seventh
was
sure
of
the
support
of
not
a
few
of
the
nobility
which
does
not
seem
to
be
our
ferguson
and
grey
stared
at
him
in
horror
monmouth
sat
biting
his
lip
more
bewildered
than
thoughtful
o
man
of
little
faith
roared
ferguson
in
a
passion
are
ye
to
be
swayed
like
a
straw
in
the
wind
i
am
no
swayed
ye
ken
this
was
ever
my
own
view
i
feel
in
my
heart
that
what
wilding
says
is
right
it
is
but
what
i
said
myself
and
captain
matthews
with
me
before
we
embarked
upon
this
expedition
we
were
in
danger
of
ruining
all
by
a
needless
precipitancy
nay
man
never
stare
so
he
said
to
grey
i
am
in
it
now
and
i
am
no
the
man
to
draw
back
nor
do
i
go
so
far
as
wilding
in
counselling
such
a
course
we
set
our
hands
to
the
plough
let
us
go
forward
in
name
yet
i
would
remind
you
that
what
wilding
says
is
true
had
we
waited
until
next
year
we
had
found
the
usurper
throne
tottering
under
him
and
on
our
landing
it
would
have
toppled
of
i
have
said
already
that
we
overset
it
with
our
hands
grey
answered
how
many
hands
have
you
asked
a
new
voice
a
crisp
discordant
voice
much
steeped
in
mockery
it
was
nick
trenchard
have
we
another
here
of
wilding
mind
cried
grey
staring
at
him
i
am
seldom
of
any
other
answered
trenchard
we
shall
no
want
for
hands
ferguson
assured
him
had
ye
arrived
earlier
ye
might
have
seen
how
readily
men
he
had
risen
and
approached
the
window
as
he
spoke
he
pulled
it
open
to
let
in
the
full
volume
of
sound
that
rose
from
the
street
below
a
monmouth
a
monmouth
voices
shouted
ferguson
struck
a
theatrical
posture
one
long
lean
arm
stretched
outward
from
the
shoulder
ye
hear
them
sirs
he
cried
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
triumph
in
his
eye
that
is
answer
enough
to
those
who
want
for
faith
to
the
feckless
ones
that
think
the
lord
will
abandon
those
that
have
set
out
to
serve
him
and
his
glance
comprehended
fletcher
trenchard
and
wilding
the
duke
stirred
in
his
chair
stretched
a
hand
for
the
bottle
and
filled
a
glass
his
mercurial
spirits
were
rising
again
he
smiled
at
wilding
i
think
you
are
answered
sir
said
he
and
i
hope
that
like
fletcher
there
who
shared
your
doubts
you
will
come
to
agree
that
since
we
have
set
our
hands
to
the
plough
we
must
go
i
have
said
that
which
i
had
it
on
my
conscience
to
say
your
grace
may
have
found
me
with
my
counsel
at
least
you
shall
find
me
no
less
ready
with
my
odso
that
is
grey
applauded
and
his
manner
was
almost
pleasant
i
never
doubted
it
wilding
his
grace
replied
but
i
should
like
to
hear
you
say
that
you
are
convinced
at
least
in
part
and
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
window
it
was
almost
as
if
he
pleaded
for
encouragement
in
common
with
most
men
who
came
in
contact
with
wilding
he
had
felt
the
latent
force
of
this
man
nature
the
strength
that
was
hidden
under
that
calm
surface
and
the
acuteness
of
the
judgment
that
must
be
wedded
to
it
he
longed
to
have
the
word
of
such
a
man
that
his
enterprise
was
not
as
desperate
as
wilding
had
seemed
at
first
to
paint
it
but
wilding
made
no
concession
to
hopes
or
desires
when
he
dealt
with
facts
men
will
flock
to
you
no
doubt
persecution
has
wearied
many
of
the
and
they
are
ready
for
revolt
but
they
are
all
untrained
in
arms
they
are
rustics
not
soldiers
if
any
of
the
men
of
position
were
to
rally
round
your
standard
they
would
bring
the
militia
and
others
in
their
train
they
would
bring
arms
horses
and
money
all
of
which
your
grace
must
be
sorely
they
will
come
answered
the
duke
some
no
doubt
wilding
agreed
but
had
it
been
next
year
i
would
have
answered
for
it
that
it
would
have
been
no
handful
had
ridden
in
to
welcome
you
scarce
a
gentleman
of
devon
or
somerset
of
dorset
or
hampshire
of
wiltshire
or
cheshire
but
would
have
hastened
to
your
they
will
come
as
it
is
the
duke
repeated
with
an
almost
womanish
insistence
persisting
in
believing
what
he
hoped
all
evidence
apart
the
door
opened
and
ensign
cragg
made
his
appearance
may
it
please
your
grace
he
announced
mr
battiscomb
has
just
arrived
and
asks
will
your
grace
receive
him
battiscomb
cried
the
duke
again
his
cheek
flushed
and
his
eye
sparkled
aye
in
heaven
name
show
him
and
may
the
lord
refresh
us
with
good
tidings
prayed
ferguson
devoutly
monmouth
turned
to
wilding
it
is
the
agent
i
sent
ahead
of
me
from
holland
to
stir
up
the
gentry
from
here
to
the
i
know
said
wilding
we
conferred
together
some
weeks
now
you
shall
see
how
idle
are
your
fears
the
duke
promised
him
and
wilding
who
was
better
informed
on
that
score
kept
silence
chapter
xiv
his
grace
in
counsel
christopher
battiscomb
that
dorchester
gentleman
who
like
wade
was
by
vocation
a
lawyer
was
ushered
into
the
presence
he
was
dressed
in
black
and
like
ferguson
was
almost
smothered
in
a
great
periwig
which
he
may
have
adopted
for
purposes
of
disguise
rather
than
adornment
certainly
he
had
none
of
that
air
of
the
soldier
of
fortune
which
distinguished
his
brother
of
the
robe
he
advanced
hat
in
hand
towards
the
table
greeting
the
company
about
it
and
wilding
observed
that
he
wore
silk
stockings
and
shoes
upon
which
there
rested
not
a
speck
of
dust
battiscomb
was
plainly
a
man
who
loved
his
ease
since
on
such
a
day
he
had
travelled
to
lyme
in
a
coach
the
lawyer
bent
low
to
kiss
the
duke
hand
and
scarce
was
that
formal
homage
paid
than
questions
poured
upon
him
from
grey
from
fletcher
and
from
ferguson
gentlemen
gentlemen
the
duke
entreated
them
smiling
and
remembering
their
manners
they
fell
silent
as
wilding
afterwards
told
trenchard
they
reminded
him
of
a
parcel
of
saucy
lacqueys
who
take
liberties
with
an
upstart
master
for
whom
they
are
wanting
in
respect
i
am
glad
to
see
you
battiscomb
said
monmouth
when
quiet
was
restored
and
i
trust
i
behold
in
you
a
bearer
of
good
the
lawyer
full
face
was
usually
pale
it
was
in
addition
solemn
and
the
smile
that
haunted
his
lips
was
a
courtesy
smile
that
expressed
neither
mirth
nor
satisfaction
he
cleared
his
throat
as
if
nervous
he
avoided
the
duke
question
as
to
the
quality
of
the
news
he
brought
by
answering
that
he
had
made
all
haste
to
come
to
lyme
upon
hearing
of
his
grace
landing
he
was
surprised
he
said
as
well
he
might
be
for
the
arrangement
was
that
having
done
his
work
he
was
to
return
to
holland
and
report
to
monmouth
upon
the
feeling
of
the
gentry
but
your
news
battiscomb
the
duke
insisted
aye
put
in
grey
in
heaven
name
let
us
hear
again
there
was
the
little
nervous
cough
from
battiscomb
i
have
scarce
had
time
to
complete
my
round
of
visits
he
temporized
your
grace
has
taken
us
so
by
surprise
i
i
was
with
sir
walter
young
at
colyton
when
the
news
of
your
landing
came
some
few
hours
his
voice
faltered
and
seemed
to
die
away
well
cried
the
duke
his
brows
were
drawn
together
already
he
realized
that
battiscomb
tidings
were
not
good
else
would
he
be
hesitating
less
in
uttering
them
is
sir
walter
with
you
at
least
i
grieve
to
say
that
he
is
not
it
was
grey
who
spoke
and
he
followed
the
ejaculation
by
an
oath
why
not
he
is
following
no
doubt
suggested
fletcher
we
may
hope
sirs
answered
battiscomb
that
in
a
few
days
when
he
shall
have
seen
the
zeal
of
the
countryside
he
will
be
cured
of
his
present
thus
discreetly
did
the
man
of
law
break
the
bad
news
he
bore
monmouth
sank
back
into
his
chair
like
one
who
has
lost
some
of
his
strength
lukewarmness
he
repeated
dully
sir
walter
young
lukewarm
even
so
your
grace
alas
and
battiscomb
sighed
audibly
ferguson
voice
boomed
forth
again
to
startle
them
the
ox
knoweth
his
owner
he
cried
the
ass
his
master
crib
but
israel
doth
not
know
my
people
doth
not
grey
pushed
the
bottle
contemptuously
across
the
table
to
the
parson
drink
man
and
get
sense
said
he
and
turned
aside
to
question
battiscomb
touching
others
of
the
neighbourhood
upon
whom
they
had
depended
what
of
sir
francis
rolles
he
inquired
battiscomb
answered
the
question
addressing
himself
to
the
duke
alas
sir
francis
no
doubt
would
have
been
faithful
to
your
grace
but
unfortunately
sir
francis
is
in
prison
deeper
grew
monmouth
frown
his
fingers
drummed
the
table
absently
fletcher
poured
himself
wine
his
face
inscrutable
grey
threw
one
leg
over
the
other
and
in
a
voice
that
was
carefully
careless
he
inquired
and
what
of
sidney
clifford
he
is
considering
said
battiscomb
i
was
to
have
seen
him
again
at
the
end
of
the
month
meanwhile
he
would
take
no
lord
gervase
scoresby
questioned
grey
less
carelessly
battiscomb
half
turned
to
him
then
faced
the
duke
again
as
he
made
answer
mr
wilding
there
can
tell
you
more
concerning
lord
all
eyes
swept
round
to
wilding
who
sat
in
silence
listening
monmouth
were
laden
with
inquiry
and
some
anxiety
wilding
shook
his
head
slowly
sadly
you
must
not
depend
upon
him
he
answered
lord
gervase
was
not
yet
ripe
a
little
longer
and
i
think
i
must
have
won
him
for
your
heaven
help
us
exclaimed
the
duke
in
petulant
vexation
is
no
one
coming
in
ferguson
swung
a
hand
towards
the
still
open
window
drawing
attention
to
the
sounds
without
does
your
grace
not
hear
that
ye
can
ask
he
cried
almost
reproachfully
but
they
scarce
heeded
him
for
grey
was
inquiring
if
strode
might
be
depended
upon
to
join
and
that
was
a
matter
that
claimed
the
greater
attention
i
think
said
battiscomb
that
he
might
have
been
depended
might
have
been
questioned
fletcher
speaking
now
for
the
first
time
since
battiscomb
arrival
like
sir
francis
rolles
he
is
in
prison
the
lawyer
explained
monmouth
leaned
forward
and
his
young
face
looked
careworn
now
he
thrust
a
slender
hand
under
the
brown
curls
upon
his
brow
will
you
tell
us
battiscomb
upon
what
friends
you
think
that
we
may
count
he
said
battiscomb
pursed
his
lips
a
second
pondering
i
think
said
he
that
you
may
count
upon
legge
and
hooper
and
possibly
upon
colonel
churchill
though
i
can
not
say
what
following
they
will
bring
if
any
trenchard
upon
whom
we
counted
for
fifteen
hundred
men
of
taunton
has
been
obliged
to
fly
the
country
to
escape
we
have
heard
that
from
trenchard
cousin
answered
the
duke
what
of
prideaux
of
ford
is
he
lukewarm
i
was
unable
to
elicit
a
definite
promise
from
him
but
he
was
favourably
disposed
to
your
his
grace
made
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
dismiss
prideaux
from
their
calculations
and
hucker
of
taunton
battiscomb
manner
grew
yet
more
ill
at
ease
mr
hucker
himself
i
am
sure
would
place
his
sword
at
your
disposal
but
his
brother
is
a
well
well
sighed
the
duke
i
take
it
we
must
not
make
certain
of
hucker
are
there
any
others
besides
legge
and
hooper
upon
whom
you
think
that
we
may
reckon
lord
wiltshire
perhaps
said
battiscomb
but
with
a
lack
of
assurance
a
plague
on
perhaps
exclaimed
monmouth
growing
irritable
i
want
you
to
name
the
men
of
whom
you
are
battiscomb
stood
silent
for
a
moment
pondering
he
looked
almost
foolish
like
a
schoolboy
who
hesitates
to
confess
his
ignorance
of
the
answer
to
a
question
set
him
fletcher
swung
round
his
grey
eyes
flashing
angrily
his
accent
more
scottish
than
ever
is
it
that
ye
certain
o
none
battiscomb
he
exclaimed
indeed
said
battiscomb
i
think
we
may
be
fairly
certain
of
legge
and
and
of
none
besides
questioned
fletcher
again
be
these
the
only
representatives
of
the
flower
of
england
nobility
that
is
to
flock
to
the
banner
of
the
cause
of
england
freedom
and
religion
scorn
was
stamped
on
every
word
of
his
question
battiscomb
spread
his
hands
raised
his
brows
and
said
nothing
the
lord
knows
i
do
not
say
it
exulting
said
fletcher
but
i
told
your
grace
yours
was
hardly
the
case
of
henry
the
seventh
as
my
lord
grey
would
have
you
we
shall
see
snapped
grey
scowling
at
the
scot
the
people
are
coming
in
hundreds
aye
in
thousands
the
gentry
will
follow
they
make
not
too
sure
your
grace
oh
make
not
too
sure
wilding
besought
the
duke
as
i
have
said
these
hinds
have
nothing
to
lose
but
their
faith
can
a
man
lose
more
asked
grey
contemptuously
he
disliked
wilding
by
instinct
which
was
but
a
reciprocation
of
the
feeling
with
which
wilding
was
inspired
by
him
i
think
he
can
said
wilding
quietly
a
man
may
lose
honour
he
may
plunge
his
family
into
ruin
these
are
things
of
more
weight
with
a
gentleman
than
odds
death
blazed
grey
giving
a
free
rein
to
his
dislike
of
this
calm
gentleman
do
you
suggest
that
a
man
honour
is
imperilled
in
his
grace
service
i
suggest
nothing
answered
wilding
unmoved
what
i
think
i
state
if
i
thought
a
man
honour
imperilled
in
this
service
you
would
not
see
me
at
this
table
now
i
can
make
you
no
more
convincing
grey
laughed
unpleasantly
and
wilding
a
faint
tinge
on
his
measured
him
with
a
stern
intrepid
look
before
which
his
lordship
shifty
glance
was
observed
to
fall
wilding
eye
having
achieved
that
much
passed
from
him
to
the
duke
and
its
expression
softened
your
grace
sees
said
he
how
well
founded
were
the
fears
i
expressed
that
your
coming
has
been
in
god
name
what
would
you
have
me
do
cried
the
duke
and
petulance
made
his
voice
unsteady
wilding
rose
moved
out
of
his
habitual
calm
by
the
earnestness
that
pervaded
him
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
again
what
i
would
have
your
grace
do
your
grace
has
heard
my
views
and
those
of
these
gentlemen
it
is
for
your
grace
to
you
mean
whether
i
will
go
forward
with
this
thing
what
alternative
have
i
no
alternative
put
in
grey
with
finality
nor
is
alternative
needed
we
carry
this
through
in
spite
of
timorous
folk
and
birds
of
that
croak
to
affright
our
service
is
the
service
of
the
lord
cried
ferguson
returning
from
the
window
in
the
embrasure
of
which
he
had
been
standing
the
lord
can
not
but
destine
it
to
ye
said
so
before
quoth
fletcher
testily
we
need
here
men
money
and
weapons
not
you
are
plainly
infected
with
wilding
disease
sneered
grey
ford
cried
the
duke
who
saw
wilding
eyes
flash
fire
you
go
too
fast
wilding
you
will
not
heed
his
i
should
not
be
likely
to
do
so
your
grace
answered
wilding
who
had
resumed
his
seat
what
shall
that
mean
quoth
grey
leaping
to
his
feet
make
it
quite
clear
to
him
tony
whispered
trenchard
coaxingly
but
wilding
was
not
as
lost
as
were
these
immediate
followers
of
the
duke
to
all
sense
of
the
respect
due
to
his
grace
i
think
said
wilding
quietly
that
you
have
forgotten
forgotten
what
bawled
grey
his
grace
his
lordship
turned
crimson
his
anger
swelled
to
think
that
the
very
terms
of
the
rebuke
precluded
his
allowing
his
feelings
a
free
rein
monmouth
leaned
forward
sit
down
he
said
to
grey
and
grey
so
lately
called
to
the
respect
he
owed
his
grace
obeyed
him
you
will
both
promise
me
that
this
affair
shall
go
no
further
i
know
you
will
do
it
if
i
ask
you
particularly
when
you
remember
how
few
are
the
followers
upon
whom
i
may
depend
i
am
not
in
case
to
lose
either
of
you
through
foolish
words
uttered
in
a
heat
which
in
both
your
hearts
is
born
i
know
of
your
loyalty
to
grey
coarse
elderly
face
took
on
a
sulky
look
his
heavy
lips
were
pouted
his
glance
sullen
wilding
on
the
contrary
smiled
across
the
table
for
my
part
i
very
gladly
give
your
grace
the
undertaking
said
he
and
took
care
not
to
observe
the
sneer
that
altered
the
line
of
lord
grey
lips
his
lordship
too
was
forced
to
give
the
same
pledge
and
he
followed
it
up
by
inveighing
sturdily
against
the
suggestion
that
they
should
retreat
i
do
protest
he
exclaimed
that
those
who
advise
your
grace
to
do
anything
but
go
forward
boldly
now
are
evil
counsellors
if
you
put
back
to
holland
you
may
leave
every
hope
behind
there
will
be
no
second
coming
for
you
your
influence
will
have
been
dissipated
men
will
not
trust
you
another
time
i
do
not
think
that
even
wilding
can
deny
the
truth
of
i
am
by
no
means
sure
said
wilding
and
fletcher
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
understanding
this
sturdy
scot
the
only
soldier
worthy
of
the
name
in
the
duke
following
who
ever
since
the
project
had
first
been
mooted
had
held
out
against
it
counselling
delay
was
in
sympathy
with
wilding
monmouth
rose
his
face
anxious
his
voice
fretful
there
can
be
no
retreat
for
me
gentlemen
though
many
that
we
depended
upon
are
not
here
to
join
us
yet
let
us
remember
that
heaven
is
on
our
side
and
that
we
are
come
to
fight
in
the
sacred
cause
of
religion
and
a
emancipation
from
the
thraldom
of
popery
oppression
and
superstition
let
this
dispel
such
doubts
as
yet
may
linger
in
our
his
words
had
a
brave
sound
but
when
analysed
they
but
formed
a
paraphrase
of
what
grey
and
ferguson
had
said
it
was
his
destiny
to
be
a
mere
echo
of
the
minds
of
other
men
just
as
he
was
now
the
tool
of
these
two
one
of
whom
plotted
seemingly
because
plotting
was
a
disease
that
had
got
into
his
blood
the
other
for
reasons
that
may
have
been
of
ambition
or
of
revenge
no
man
will
ever
know
for
certain
in
the
chamber
they
shared
trenchard
and
wilding
reviewed
that
night
the
scene
so
lately
enacted
in
which
one
had
taken
an
active
part
the
other
been
little
more
than
a
spectator
trenchard
had
come
from
the
duke
presence
entirely
out
of
conceit
with
monmouth
and
his
cause
contemptuous
of
ferguson
angry
with
grey
and
indifferent
towards
fletcher
i
am
committed
and
i
not
draw
back
said
he
but
i
tell
you
anthony
my
heart
is
not
confederate
with
my
hand
in
this
bah
he
railed
we
serve
a
man
of
straw
a
perkin
a
very
pope
of
a
wilding
sighed
he
scarce
the
man
for
such
an
undertaking
said
he
i
fear
we
have
been
trenchard
was
drawing
off
his
boots
he
paused
in
the
act
aye
said
he
misled
by
our
blindness
what
else
after
all
should
we
have
expected
of
him
he
cried
contemptuously
the
cause
is
good
but
its
leader
would
you
have
such
a
puppet
as
that
on
the
throne
of
england
he
does
not
aim
so
be
not
so
sure
we
shall
hear
more
of
the
black
box
anon
and
of
the
marriage
certificate
it
contains
not
surprise
me
if
they
were
to
produce
forgeries
of
the
one
and
the
other
to
prove
his
marriage
to
lucy
walters
anthony
anthony
to
what
a
business
are
we
wedded
wilding
already
abed
turned
impatiently
things
cried
aloud
to
be
redressed
a
leader
was
necessary
and
none
other
offered
that
is
the
whole
story
but
our
chance
is
slender
and
it
might
have
been
that
ford
lord
grey
has
made
it
so
grumbled
trenchard
busy
with
his
stockings
this
sudden
coming
is
his
work
you
heard
what
fletcher
said
how
he
opposed
it
when
first
it
was
he
paused
and
looked
up
suddenly
blister
me
he
cried
is
it
his
purpose
think
you
to
work
the
ruin
of
monmouth
what
are
you
saying
nick
there
are
certain
rumours
current
touching
his
grace
and
lady
grey
a
man
like
grey
might
well
resort
to
some
such
scheme
of
get
to
sleep
nick
said
wilding
yawning
you
are
dreaming
already
such
a
plan
would
be
over
elaborate
for
his
lordship
mind
it
would
ask
a
villainy
parallel
with
your
trenchard
climbed
into
bed
and
settled
himself
under
the
coverlet
maybe
said
he
and
maybe
not
but
i
think
that
were
it
not
for
that
cursed
business
of
the
letter
richard
westmacott
stole
from
us
i
should
be
going
my
ways
and
leaving
his
grace
of
monmouth
to
go
aye
and
i
go
with
you
answered
wilding
i
little
taste
for
suicide
but
we
are
in
it
was
a
sad
pity
you
meddled
this
morning
in
that
affair
at
taunton
mused
trenchard
wistfully
a
sadder
pity
you
were
bitten
with
a
taste
for
matrimony
he
added
thoughtfully
and
blew
out
the
rushlight
chapter
xv
lyme
of
the
king
on
the
next
day
which
was
friday
the
country
folk
continued
to
come
in
and
by
evening
monmouth
forces
amounted
to
a
thousand
foot
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
horse
the
men
were
armed
as
fast
as
they
were
enrolled
and
scarce
a
field
or
quiet
avenue
in
the
district
but
resounded
to
the
tramp
of
feet
the
rattle
of
weapons
and
the
sharp
orders
of
the
officers
who
by
drilling
were
converting
this
raw
material
into
soldiers
on
the
saturday
the
rally
of
the
duke
standard
was
such
that
monmouth
threw
off
at
last
the
gloomy
forebodings
that
had
burdened
his
soul
since
that
meeting
on
thursday
night
wade
holmes
foulkes
and
fox
were
able
to
set
about
forming
the
first
four
regiments
the
duke
and
the
green
the
white
and
the
yellow
monmouth
spirits
continued
to
rise
for
he
had
been
joined
by
now
by
legge
and
hooper
the
two
upon
whom
battiscomb
had
counted
and
by
colonel
joshua
churchill
of
whom
battiscomb
had
been
less
certain
captain
matthews
brought
news
that
lord
wiltshire
and
the
gentlemen
of
hampshire
might
be
expected
if
they
could
force
their
way
through
albemarle
militia
which
was
already
closing
round
lyme
long
before
evening
willing
fellows
were
being
turned
away
in
hundreds
for
lack
of
weapons
in
spite
of
monmouth
big
talk
on
landing
and
of
the
rumour
that
had
gone
out
that
he
could
arm
thirty
thousand
men
his
stock
of
arms
was
exhausted
by
a
mere
fifteen
hundred
trenchard
who
now
held
a
major
rank
in
the
horse
attached
to
the
duke
own
regiment
was
loud
in
his
scorn
of
this
state
of
things
wilding
was
sad
and
his
depression
again
spread
to
the
duke
after
a
few
words
had
passed
between
them
towards
evening
fletcher
was
for
heroic
measures
he
looked
only
ahead
now
like
the
good
soldier
that
he
was
and
already
he
began
to
suggest
a
bold
dash
for
exeter
for
weapons
horses
and
possibly
the
militia
as
well
for
they
had
ample
evidence
that
the
men
composing
it
might
easily
be
induced
to
desert
to
the
duke
side
the
suggestion
was
one
that
instantly
received
wilding
heartiest
approval
it
seemed
to
fill
him
suddenly
with
hope
and
he
spoke
of
it
indeed
as
an
inspiration
which
if
acted
upon
might
yet
save
the
situation
the
duke
was
undecided
as
ever
he
was
too
much
troubled
weighing
the
chances
for
and
against
and
he
would
decide
upon
nothing
until
he
had
consulted
grey
and
the
others
he
would
summon
a
council
that
night
he
promised
and
the
matter
should
be
considered
but
that
council
was
never
to
be
called
for
andrew
association
with
the
rebellion
was
drawing
rapidly
to
its
close
and
there
was
that
to
happen
in
the
next
few
hours
which
should
counteract
all
the
encouragement
with
which
the
duke
had
been
fortified
that
day
towards
evening
little
heywood
dare
the
taunton
goldsmith
who
had
landed
at
seatown
and
gone
out
with
the
news
of
the
duke
arrival
rode
into
lyme
with
forty
horse
mounted
himself
upon
a
beautiful
charger
which
was
destined
to
be
the
undoing
of
him
news
came
too
that
the
dorset
militia
were
at
bridport
eight
miles
away
whereupon
wilding
and
fletcher
postponed
all
further
suggestion
of
the
dash
for
exeter
proposing
that
in
the
mean
time
a
night
attack
upon
bridport
might
result
well
for
once
lord
grey
was
in
agreement
with
them
and
so
the
matter
was
decided
fletcher
went
down
to
arm
and
mount
and
all
the
world
knows
the
story
of
the
foolish
quarrel
which
robbed
monmouth
of
two
of
his
most
valued
adherents
by
the
scot
eyes
lighted
upon
the
fine
horse
that
dare
had
brought
from
ford
abbey
it
occurred
to
him
that
nothing
could
be
more
fitting
than
that
the
best
man
should
sit
upon
the
best
horse
and
he
forthwith
led
the
beast
from
the
stables
and
was
about
to
mount
when
dare
came
forth
to
catch
him
in
the
very
act
the
goldsmith
was
a
rude
peppery
fellow
who
did
not
mince
his
words
what
a
plague
are
you
doing
with
that
horse
he
cried
fletcher
paused
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
looked
the
fellow
up
and
down
i
am
mounting
it
said
he
and
proceeded
to
do
as
he
said
but
dare
caught
him
by
the
tails
of
his
coat
and
brought
him
back
to
earth
you
are
making
a
mistake
fletcher
he
cried
angrily
that
horse
is
fletcher
whose
temper
was
by
no
means
of
the
most
peaceful
kept
himself
with
difficulty
in
hand
at
the
indignity
dare
offered
him
yours
quoth
he
aye
mine
i
brought
it
from
ford
abbey
for
the
duke
service
fletcher
reminded
him
for
my
own
sir
for
my
own
i
would
have
you
and
brushing
the
scot
aside
he
caught
the
bridle
and
sought
to
wrench
it
from
fletcher
hand
but
fletcher
maintained
his
hold
softly
dare
said
he
a
trifle
true
to
your
name
as
you
once
told
his
late
majesty
take
your
hands
from
my
horse
dare
shouted
very
angry
several
loiterers
in
the
yard
gathered
round
to
watch
the
scene
culling
diversion
from
it
and
speculating
upon
the
conclusion
it
might
have
one
rash
young
fellow
offered
audibly
to
lay
ten
to
one
that
paymaster
dare
would
have
the
best
of
the
argument
dare
overheard
and
was
spurred
on
i
will
by
god
he
answered
come
fletcher
and
he
shook
the
bridle
again
there
was
a
dull
flush
showing
through
the
tan
of
fletcher
skin
mr
dare
said
he
this
horse
is
no
more
yours
than
mine
it
is
the
duke
and
i
as
one
o
the
leaders
claim
it
in
the
duke
aye
sir
cried
an
onlooker
encouraging
fletcher
and
did
the
mischief
it
so
goaded
dare
to
have
his
antagonist
in
this
trifling
matter
supported
that
he
utterly
lost
his
head
i
have
said
the
horse
is
mine
and
i
repeat
it
let
go
the
bridle
let
it
go
still
fletcher
striving
hard
to
keep
his
calm
clung
to
the
reins
let
it
go
you
damned
thieving
scot
screamed
dare
in
a
fury
and
struck
fletcher
with
his
whip
it
was
unfortunate
for
them
both
that
he
should
have
had
that
switch
in
his
hand
at
such
a
time
but
more
unfortunate
still
was
it
that
fletcher
should
have
had
a
pistol
in
his
belt
the
scot
dropped
the
bridle
at
last
dropped
it
to
pluck
forth
the
weapon
hi
i
did
not
began
dare
who
had
stood
appalled
by
what
he
had
done
in
the
second
or
two
that
had
passed
since
he
had
delivered
the
blow
the
rest
of
his
sentence
was
drowned
in
the
report
of
pistol
and
dare
dropped
dead
on
the
rough
cobbles
of
the
yard
ferguson
has
left
it
on
record
and
presumably
he
had
word
for
it
that
it
was
no
part
of
the
scot
intent
to
do
dare
a
mischief
he
had
but
drawn
the
pistol
to
intimidate
him
into
better
manners
but
in
his
haste
he
accidentally
pulled
the
trigger
however
that
may
be
there
was
dare
as
dead
as
the
stones
on
which
he
lay
and
fletcher
with
a
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
after
that
all
was
confusion
fletcher
was
seized
by
those
who
had
witnessed
the
deed
there
was
none
thought
it
an
accident
indeed
they
were
all
ready
enough
to
say
that
fletcher
had
received
excessive
provocation
he
was
haled
to
the
presence
of
the
duke
with
whom
were
grey
and
wilding
at
the
time
and
old
dare
son
an
ensign
in
goodenough
company
came
clamouring
for
vengeance
backed
by
such
goodly
numbers
that
the
distraught
duke
was
forced
to
show
at
least
the
outward
seeming
of
it
wilding
who
knew
the
value
of
this
scottish
soldier
of
fortune
who
had
seen
so
much
service
strenuously
urged
his
enlargement
it
was
not
a
time
to
let
the
fortunes
of
a
cause
suffer
through
such
an
act
as
this
deplorable
though
it
might
be
the
evidence
showed
that
fletcher
had
been
provoked
he
had
been
struck
a
thing
that
might
well
justify
the
anger
in
the
heat
of
which
he
had
done
this
thing
grey
was
stolid
and
silent
saying
nothing
either
for
or
against
the
man
who
had
divided
with
him
under
the
duke
the
honours
of
the
supreme
command
monmouth
white
and
sat
and
listened
first
to
wilding
then
to
dare
and
lastly
to
fletcher
himself
but
it
was
young
dare
dare
and
his
followers
who
prevailed
they
were
too
numerous
and
turbulent
and
they
must
at
all
costs
be
conciliated
or
there
was
no
telling
to
what
extremes
they
might
not
go
and
so
there
was
an
end
to
the
share
of
andrew
fletcher
of
saltoun
in
this
undertaking
the
end
of
the
only
man
who
was
of
any
capacity
to
pilot
it
through
the
troubled
waters
that
lay
before
it
monmouth
placed
him
under
arrest
and
sent
him
aboard
the
frigate
again
ordering
her
captain
to
sail
at
once
that
was
the
utmost
monmouth
could
do
to
save
him
wilding
continued
to
plead
with
the
duke
after
fletcher
removal
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
at
last
monmouth
determined
that
fletcher
should
rejoin
them
later
when
the
affair
should
have
blown
over
and
he
sent
word
accordingly
to
the
scot
even
in
this
there
were
manifestations
of
antagonism
between
wilding
and
lord
grey
and
it
almost
seemed
enough
that
wilding
should
suggest
a
course
for
lord
grey
instantly
to
oppose
it
the
effects
of
fletcher
removal
were
not
long
in
following
on
the
morrow
came
the
bridport
affair
and
grey
shameful
conduct
when
had
he
stood
his
ground
victory
must
have
been
assured
the
duke
forces
instead
of
just
that
honourable
retreat
by
which
colonel
wade
so
gallantly
saved
the
situation
wilding
did
not
mince
his
words
in
putting
it
that
grey
had
run
away
in
his
room
at
the
george
inn
monmouth
deeply
distressed
asked
wilding
and
colonel
matthews
what
action
he
should
take
in
the
matter
how
deal
with
grey
there
is
no
other
general
in
europe
would
ask
that
your
grace
answered
matthews
gravely
and
wilding
added
without
an
hesitation
that
his
grace
course
was
plain
it
would
be
an
unwise
thing
to
expose
the
troops
to
the
chance
of
more
such
monmouth
dismissed
them
and
sent
for
grey
and
he
seemed
resolved
to
deal
with
him
as
he
deserved
yet
an
hour
later
when
wilding
matthews
wade
and
the
others
were
ordered
to
attend
the
duke
in
council
there
was
his
lordship
seemingly
on
as
good
terms
as
ever
with
his
grace
they
were
assembled
to
discuss
the
next
step
which
it
might
be
advisable
to
take
for
the
militia
was
closing
in
around
them
and
to
remain
longer
in
lyme
would
be
to
be
caught
there
as
in
a
trap
it
was
grey
who
advanced
the
first
suggestion
his
assurance
no
whit
abated
by
the
shameful
thing
that
had
befallen
by
the
cowardice
which
he
had
betrayed
that
we
must
quit
lyme
we
are
all
agreed
said
he
i
would
propose
that
your
grace
march
north
to
gloucester
where
our
cheshire
friends
will
assemble
to
meet
colonel
matthews
reminded
the
duke
of
andrew
fletcher
proposal
that
they
should
make
a
raid
upon
exeter
with
a
view
to
seizing
arms
of
which
they
stood
so
sorely
in
need
this
wilding
was
quick
to
support
not
only
that
your
grace
he
said
but
i
am
confident
that
with
very
little
inducement
the
greater
portion
of
the
militia
will
desert
to
us
as
soon
as
we
appear
what
assurance
can
you
give
of
that
asked
grey
his
heavy
lip
protruded
i
take
it
said
wilding
that
in
such
matters
no
man
can
give
an
assurance
of
anything
i
speak
with
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
folk
from
which
the
militia
is
enlisted
i
offer
it
as
my
opinion
that
the
militia
is
favourably
disposed
to
your
grace
i
can
do
no
more
if
wilding
says
so
your
grace
put
in
matthews
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
sound
reasons
upon
which
to
base
his
opinion
no
doubt
said
monmouth
indeed
i
had
already
thought
of
the
step
that
you
suggest
colonel
matthews
and
what
wilding
says
causes
me
to
look
upon
it
still
more
grey
frowned
consider
your
grace
he
said
earnestly
that
you
are
in
no
case
to
fight
at
what
fighting
do
you
suggest
there
would
be
asked
the
duke
there
is
albemarle
between
us
and
but
with
the
militia
wilding
reminded
him
and
if
the
militia
deserts
him
for
your
grace
in
what
case
will
albemarle
find
himself
and
if
the
militia
does
not
desert
if
you
should
be
proven
wrong
sir
what
then
what
then
asked
grey
aye
true
what
then
wilding
quoth
the
duke
already
wavering
wilding
considered
a
moment
all
eyes
upon
him
even
then
said
he
presently
i
do
maintain
that
in
this
dash
for
exeter
lies
your
greatest
chance
of
success
we
can
deliver
battle
if
need
be
already
we
are
three
thousand
strong
grey
interrupted
him
rudely
nay
he
insisted
you
must
not
presume
upon
that
we
are
not
yet
fit
to
fight
it
is
his
grace
business
at
present
to
drill
and
discipline
his
troops
and
induce
more
friends
to
join
already
we
are
turning
men
away
because
we
have
no
weapons
to
put
into
their
hands
wilding
reminded
them
and
a
murmur
of
approval
ran
round
which
but
served
to
anger
grey
the
more
to
render
more
obstinate
his
opposition
but
all
that
come
in
are
not
unprovided
was
his
lordship
retort
there
are
the
hampshire
gentry
and
their
friends
they
will
come
armed
and
so
will
others
if
we
have
patience
aye
said
wilding
and
if
you
have
patience
enough
there
will
be
troops
the
parliament
will
send
against
us
they
too
will
be
armed
i
can
assure
your
in
god
name
let
us
keep
from
wrangling
the
duke
besought
them
it
is
difficult
enough
to
determine
for
the
best
if
the
dash
to
exeter
were
successful
it
can
not
be
grey
interrupted
again
the
liberties
he
took
with
monmouth
and
which
monmouth
permitted
him
might
well
be
a
source
of
wonder
to
all
who
heard
them
monmouth
paused
now
in
his
interrupted
speech
and
looked
about
him
a
trifle
wearily
it
seems
idle
to
insist
said
wilding
such
is
the
temper
of
your
grace
counsellors
that
we
get
no
further
than
bold
eyes
were
upon
wilding
as
he
spoke
i
would
remind
your
grace
and
i
am
sure
that
many
present
will
agree
with
me
that
in
a
desperate
enterprise
a
sudden
unexpected
movement
will
often
strike
that
is
true
said
monmouth
but
apparently
without
enthusiasm
and
having
approved
what
was
urged
on
one
side
he
looked
at
grey
as
if
waiting
to
hear
what
might
be
said
on
the
other
his
indecision
was
pitiful
tragical
indeed
in
the
leader
of
so
bold
an
enterprise
we
should
do
better
i
think
said
grey
to
deal
with
the
facts
as
we
know
it
is
what
i
am
endeavouring
to
do
your
grace
protested
wilding
a
note
of
despair
in
his
voice
perhaps
some
other
gentleman
will
put
forward
better
counsel
than
aye
in
heaven
name
let
us
hope
so
snorted
grey
and
monmouth
catching
the
sudden
flash
of
wilding
eye
set
a
hand
upon
his
lordship
arm
as
if
to
urge
him
to
be
gentler
but
he
continued
when
men
talk
of
striking
terror
by
sudden
movements
they
build
on
i
had
hardly
thought
to
hear
that
from
your
lordship
said
wilding
and
he
permitted
himself
that
smile
that
gave
his
face
so
wicked
a
look
and
why
not
asked
grey
stupidly
unsuspicious
because
i
had
thought
you
might
have
concluded
otherwise
from
your
own
experience
at
bridport
this
grey
got
angrily
to
his
feet
rage
and
shame
flushing
his
face
and
it
needed
ferguson
and
the
duke
to
restore
him
to
some
semblance
of
calm
indeed
it
may
well
be
that
it
was
to
complete
this
that
his
grace
decided
there
and
then
that
they
should
follow
grey
advice
and
go
by
way
of
taunton
bridgwater
and
bristol
to
gloucester
he
was
like
all
weak
men
of
conspicuous
mental
the
matter
of
the
moment
was
ever
of
greater
importance
to
him
than
any
result
that
might
attend
it
in
the
future
he
insisted
that
wilding
and
grey
should
shake
hands
before
the
breaking
up
of
that
most
astounding
council
and
as
he
had
done
last
night
he
now
again
imposed
upon
them
his
commands
that
they
must
not
allow
this
matter
to
go
further
wilding
paved
the
way
for
peace
by
making
an
apology
within
limitations
if
in
my
zeal
to
serve
your
grace
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
have
said
that
which
lord
grey
thinks
fit
to
resent
i
would
bid
him
consider
my
motive
rather
than
my
actual
but
when
all
had
gone
save
ferguson
the
chaplain
approached
the
preoccupied
and
distressed
duke
with
counsel
that
wilding
should
be
sent
away
from
the
army
else
there
be
trouble
him
and
grey
the
plotting
parson
foretold
we
be
having
a
repetition
of
the
unfortunate
fletcher
and
dare
affair
and
i
think
that
has
cost
your
grace
enough
do
you
suggest
that
i
dismiss
wilding
cried
the
duke
you
know
his
influence
and
the
bad
impression
his
removal
would
ferguson
stroked
his
long
lean
jaw
no
no
said
he
all
i
suggest
is
that
you
find
wilding
work
to
do
elsewhere
the
duke
questioned
where
else
i
have
thought
of
that
too
send
him
to
london
to
see
danvers
and
to
stir
up
your
friends
there
and
he
added
lowering
his
voice
give
him
discretion
to
see
sunderland
if
he
thinks
the
proposition
pleased
monmouth
and
it
seemed
to
please
wilding
no
less
when
having
sent
for
him
the
duke
communicated
it
to
him
in
ferguson
presence
upon
this
mission
wilding
set
out
that
very
night
leaving
nick
trenchard
in
despair
at
being
separated
from
him
at
a
time
when
there
seemed
to
be
every
chance
that
such
a
separation
might
be
eternal
monmouth
and
ferguson
may
have
conceived
they
did
a
wise
thing
in
removing
a
man
who
was
instinctively
spoiling
for
a
little
with
my
lord
grey
it
is
odds
that
had
he
remained
the
brewing
storm
between
the
pair
would
have
come
to
a
head
had
it
done
so
it
is
more
than
likely
from
what
we
know
of
wilding
accomplishments
that
he
had
given
lord
grey
his
quietus
and
had
that
happened
it
is
to
be
inferred
from
history
that
it
is
possible
the
duke
of
rebellion
might
have
had
a
less
disastrous
issue
chapter
xvi
plots
and
plotters
wilding
left
monmouth
army
at
lyme
on
sunday
the
of
june
and
rejoined
it
at
bridgwater
exactly
three
weeks
later
in
the
meanwhile
a
good
deal
had
happened
yet
the
happenings
on
every
hand
had
fallen
far
short
of
the
expectations
aroused
in
wilding
mind
now
by
one
circumstance
now
by
another
in
reaching
london
he
had
experienced
no
difficulty
men
travelling
in
that
direction
were
not
subjected
to
the
scrutiny
that
fell
to
the
share
of
those
travelling
from
it
towards
the
west
or
rather
to
the
scrutiny
ordained
by
the
government
for
wilding
had
more
than
one
opportunity
of
observing
how
very
lax
and
indifferent
were
the
constables
and
particularly
in
somerset
and
wiltshire
in
the
performance
of
this
duty
wayfarers
were
questioned
as
a
matter
of
form
but
in
no
case
did
wilding
hear
of
any
one
being
detained
upon
suspicion
this
was
calculated
to
raise
his
drooping
hopes
pointing
as
it
did
to
the
general
favouring
of
monmouth
that
was
toward
he
grew
less
despondent
on
the
score
of
the
duke
possible
ultimate
success
and
he
came
to
hope
that
the
efforts
he
went
to
exert
would
not
be
fruitless
but
rude
were
the
disappointments
that
awaited
him
in
town
london
like
the
rest
of
the
country
was
not
ready
there
were
not
wanting
men
who
favoured
monmouth
but
no
rising
had
been
organized
and
the
partisans
were
not
disposed
to
rashness
wilding
lodged
at
covent
garden
in
a
house
recommended
to
him
by
colonel
danvers
and
there
an
outlaw
himself
he
threw
himself
with
a
will
into
his
task
he
heard
of
the
burning
of
monmouth
declaration
by
the
common
hangman
at
the
royal
exchange
and
of
the
bill
passed
by
the
commons
to
make
it
treason
for
any
to
assert
that
lucy
walters
was
married
to
the
late
king
he
attended
meetings
at
the
bull
head
in
bishopsgate
where
he
met
disney
and
danvers
payton
and
lock
but
though
they
talked
and
argued
at
prodigious
length
they
did
naught
besides
danvers
who
was
their
hope
in
town
definitely
refused
to
have
a
hand
in
anything
that
was
not
properly
organized
and
in
common
with
the
others
urged
that
they
should
wait
until
cheshire
had
risen
as
was
reported
that
it
must
meanwhile
troops
had
gone
west
under
kirke
and
churchill
and
the
parliament
had
voted
nearly
half
a
million
for
the
putting
down
of
the
rebellion
london
was
flung
into
a
fever
of
excitement
by
the
news
that
was
reaching
it
the
position
was
not
quite
as
advisers
before
coming
over
from
holland
had
represented
that
it
would
be
they
had
thought
that
out
of
fear
of
tumults
about
his
own
person
king
james
would
have
been
compelled
to
keep
near
him
what
troops
he
had
sparing
none
to
be
sent
against
monmouth
this
king
james
had
not
done
he
had
all
but
emptied
london
of
soldiery
and
considering
the
general
disaffection
no
moment
could
have
been
more
favourable
than
this
for
a
rising
in
london
itself
the
confusion
that
must
have
resulted
from
the
recalling
of
troops
would
have
given
monmouth
not
only
a
mighty
grip
of
the
west
but
would
have
heartened
those
who
like
sunderland
himself
were
sitting
on
the
wall
to
declare
themselves
for
the
protestant
champion
this
wilding
saw
and
almost
frenziedly
did
he
urge
it
upon
danvers
that
all
london
needed
at
the
moment
was
a
resolute
leader
but
the
colonel
still
held
back
indeed
he
had
neither
truth
nor
valour
he
was
timid
and
used
deceit
to
mask
his
timidity
he
urged
frivolous
reasons
for
inaction
and
when
wilding
waxed
impatient
with
him
he
suggested
that
wilding
himself
should
head
the
rising
if
he
were
so
confident
of
its
success
and
wilding
would
have
done
it
but
that
being
unknown
in
london
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
men
would
flock
to
him
if
he
raised
the
duke
banner
later
when
the
excitement
grew
and
rumours
ran
through
town
that
monmouth
had
now
a
following
of
twenty
thousand
men
and
that
the
forces
were
falling
back
before
him
and
discontent
was
rife
at
the
commissioning
of
catholic
lords
to
levy
troops
wilding
again
pressed
the
matter
upon
danvers
surely
no
moment
could
be
more
propitious
but
again
he
received
the
same
answer
that
danvers
had
lacked
time
to
organize
matters
sufficiently
that
the
duke
coming
had
taken
him
by
surprise
lastly
came
the
news
that
monmouth
had
been
crowned
at
taunton
amid
the
wildest
enthusiasm
and
that
there
were
now
in
england
two
men
each
of
whom
called
himself
king
james
the
second
this
was
the
excuse
that
danvers
needed
to
be
rid
of
a
business
he
had
not
the
courage
to
transact
to
a
finish
he
swore
that
he
washed
his
hands
of
affairs
that
the
latter
had
broken
faith
with
him
and
the
promise
he
had
made
him
in
having
himself
proclaimed
king
he
protested
that
monmouth
had
done
ill
and
prophesied
that
his
act
would
alienate
from
him
the
numerous
republicans
who
like
danvers
had
hitherto
looked
to
him
for
the
country
salvation
wilding
himself
was
appalled
at
the
news
for
monmouth
was
indeed
going
further
than
men
had
been
given
to
understand
nevertheless
for
his
own
sake
in
very
now
if
out
of
no
motives
of
loyalty
to
the
duke
he
must
urge
forward
the
fortunes
of
this
man
he
had
high
words
with
danvers
and
the
two
might
have
quarrelled
before
long
but
for
the
sudden
arrest
of
disney
which
threw
danvers
into
such
a
panic
that
he
fled
incontinently
abandoning
in
body
as
he
already
appeared
to
have
abandoned
in
spirit
the
monmouth
cause
the
arrest
of
disney
struck
a
chill
into
wilding
from
his
lodging
at
covent
garden
he
had
communicated
cautiously
with
sunderland
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
building
upon
certain
information
he
had
received
from
the
duke
at
parting
as
to
sunderland
attachment
to
the
cause
he
had
carefully
chosen
his
moment
for
making
this
communication
having
a
certain
innate
mistrust
of
a
man
who
so
obviously
as
sunderland
was
running
with
the
hare
and
hunting
with
the
hounds
he
had
sent
a
letter
to
the
secretary
of
state
when
london
was
agog
with
the
axminster
affair
and
the
tale
of
which
sir
edward
phelips
wrote
to
colonel
berkeley
as
the
shamefullest
story
that
you
ever
heard
of
how
albemarle
forces
and
the
somerset
militia
had
run
before
monmouth
in
spite
of
their
own
overwhelming
numbers
this
promised
ill
for
james
particularly
when
it
was
perceived
as
perceived
it
was
that
this
running
away
was
not
all
cowardice
not
all
the
shamefullest
story
that
phelips
accounted
it
it
was
an
expression
of
towards
monmouth
on
the
part
of
the
militia
of
the
west
and
it
was
confidently
expected
that
the
next
news
would
be
that
these
men
who
had
decamped
before
him
would
presently
be
found
to
have
ranged
themselves
under
his
banner
sunderland
had
given
no
sign
that
he
had
received
communication
and
wilding
drew
his
own
contemptuous
conclusions
of
the
secretary
of
state
cautious
policy
it
was
a
fortnight
later
when
london
was
settling
down
again
from
the
diversion
of
excitement
created
by
the
news
of
argyle
defeat
in
scotland
before
wilding
attempted
to
approach
sunderland
again
he
awaited
a
favourable
opportunity
and
this
he
had
when
london
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
the
alarming
news
of
the
duke
of
somerset
urgent
demand
for
reinforcements
unless
he
had
them
he
declared
the
whole
country
was
lost
as
he
could
not
get
the
militia
to
stand
whilst
lord
stawell
regiment
were
all
fled
and
mostly
gone
over
to
the
rebels
at
bridgwater
this
was
grave
news
but
it
was
followed
in
a
few
days
by
graver
the
affair
at
philips
norton
was
exaggerated
by
report
into
a
wholesale
defeat
of
the
loyal
army
and
it
was
reported
on
apparently
such
good
authority
that
it
received
credence
in
quarters
that
might
have
waited
for
official
news
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
had
been
slain
by
the
militia
which
had
mutinied
and
deserted
to
monmouth
it
was
while
this
news
was
going
round
that
sunderland
in
a
moment
of
panic
at
last
vouchsafed
an
answer
to
wilding
letters
and
he
vouchsafed
it
in
person
just
as
wilding
particularly
since
arrest
was
beginning
to
lose
all
hope
he
came
one
evening
to
wilding
lodgings
in
covent
garden
unattended
and
closely
muffled
and
he
remained
closeted
with
the
duke
ambassador
for
nigh
upon
an
hour
at
the
end
of
which
he
entrusted
wilding
with
a
letter
for
the
duke
very
brief
but
entirely
to
the
point
which
expressed
him
most
devoted
servant
you
may
well
judge
sir
he
had
said
at
parting
that
this
is
not
such
a
letter
as
i
should
entrust
to
any
wilding
had
bowed
gravely
and
gravely
he
had
expressed
himself
sensible
of
the
exceptional
honour
his
lordship
did
him
by
such
a
trust
and
i
depend
upon
you
sir
as
you
are
a
man
of
honour
to
take
such
measures
as
will
ensure
against
its
falling
into
any
but
the
hands
for
which
it
is
as
i
am
a
man
of
honour
you
may
depend
upon
me
wilding
solemnly
promised
will
your
lordship
give
me
three
lines
above
your
signature
that
will
save
me
from
molestation
thus
you
will
facilitate
the
preservation
of
this
i
had
already
thought
of
that
was
sunderland
answer
and
he
placed
before
wilding
three
lines
of
writing
signed
and
sealed
which
enjoined
all
straitly
in
the
king
name
to
suffer
the
bearer
to
pass
and
repass
and
to
offer
him
no
hindrance
on
that
they
shook
hands
and
parted
sunderland
to
return
to
whitehall
and
his
obedience
to
the
king
james
whom
he
was
ready
to
betray
as
soon
as
he
saw
profit
for
himself
in
the
act
wilding
to
return
to
somerset
to
the
king
james
in
whom
his
faith
was
scant
indeed
but
with
whom
his
fortunes
were
irrevocably
bound
up
meanwhile
monmouth
was
back
in
bridgwater
his
second
occupation
of
which
town
was
not
being
looked
upon
with
unmixed
favour
the
inhabitants
had
suffered
enough
already
from
his
first
visit
his
return
there
after
the
philips
norton
affair
of
which
such
grossly
exaggerated
reports
had
reached
london
and
which
in
point
of
fact
had
been
little
better
than
a
drawn
battle
had
been
looked
upon
with
dread
by
some
with
disfavour
by
others
and
with
dismay
by
not
a
few
who
viewed
in
this
an
augury
of
failure
now
sir
rowland
blake
who
since
his
pursuit
of
wilding
and
trenchard
on
the
occasion
of
their
flight
from
taunton
had
in
spite
of
his
failure
on
that
occasion
been
more
or
less
in
the
service
of
albemarle
and
the
loyal
army
saw
in
this
indisposition
towards
monmouth
of
so
many
of
bridgwater
inhabitants
great
possibilities
of
profit
to
himself
he
was
at
lupton
house
the
guest
of
his
friend
richard
westmacott
and
the
open
suitor
of
ruth
entirely
ignoring
the
circumstance
that
she
was
nominally
the
wife
of
wilding
this
to
the
infinite
chagrin
of
miss
horton
who
saw
all
her
scheming
likely
to
go
for
nothing
in
his
heart
of
hearts
it
was
a
matter
of
not
the
slightest
consequence
to
sir
rowland
whether
james
stuart
or
james
scott
occupied
the
throne
of
england
his
own
affairs
gave
him
more
than
enough
to
think
of
and
these
disturbances
in
the
west
were
very
welcome
to
him
since
they
rendered
difficult
any
attempt
to
trace
him
on
the
part
of
his
london
creditors
it
happens
however
very
commonly
that
enmity
to
an
individual
will
lead
to
enmity
to
the
cause
which
that
individual
espouses
thus
may
it
have
been
with
sir
rowland
his
hatred
of
wilding
and
his
keen
desire
to
see
wilding
destroyed
had
made
him
a
zealous
partisan
of
the
loyal
cause
richard
westmacott
easily
swayed
and
overborne
by
the
town
rake
whose
vices
made
him
seem
to
richard
the
embodiment
of
all
that
is
splendid
and
enviable
in
man
had
become
practically
the
baronet
tool
now
that
he
had
abandoned
cause
sir
rowland
had
not
considered
it
beneath
the
dignity
of
his
name
and
station
to
discharge
in
bridgwater
certain
functions
that
made
him
more
or
less
a
spy
and
so
reliable
had
been
the
information
he
had
sent
feversham
and
albemarle
during
monmouth
first
occupation
of
the
town
that
he
had
won
by
now
their
complete
confidence
the
second
occupation
and
its
unpopularity
with
many
of
those
who
earlier
if
lukewarm
had
been
partisans
of
the
duke
swelled
the
number
of
loyally
inclined
people
in
bridgwater
and
suddenly
inspired
sir
rowland
with
a
scheme
by
which
at
a
blow
he
might
snuff
out
the
rebellion
this
scheme
involved
the
capture
of
the
duke
and
the
reward
of
success
should
mean
far
more
to
blake
than
the
five
thousand
pounds
at
which
the
value
of
the
duke
head
had
already
been
fixed
by
parliament
he
needed
a
tool
for
this
and
he
even
thought
of
westmacott
and
lupton
house
but
afterwards
preferred
a
newlington
who
was
in
better
case
to
assist
him
this
newlington
an
exceedingly
prosperous
merchant
and
one
of
the
richest
men
perhaps
in
the
whole
west
of
england
looked
with
extreme
disfavour
upon
monmouth
whose
advent
had
paralyzed
his
industries
to
an
extent
that
was
costing
him
a
fine
round
sum
of
money
weekly
he
was
now
in
alarm
lest
the
town
of
bridgwater
should
be
made
to
pay
dearly
for
having
harboured
the
protestant
duke
he
had
no
faith
whatever
in
the
protestant
duke
ultimate
prevailing
and
that
he
as
one
of
the
town
most
prominent
and
prosperous
citizens
might
be
amongst
the
heaviest
sufferers
in
spite
of
his
neutrality
this
neutrality
he
observed
because
it
was
hardly
safe
in
that
disaffected
town
for
a
man
to
proclaim
himself
a
loyalist
to
him
sir
rowland
expounded
his
audacious
plan
he
sought
out
the
merchant
in
his
handsome
mansion
on
the
night
of
that
friday
which
had
witnessed
monmouth
return
and
the
merchant
honoured
by
the
visit
of
this
gallant
ignorant
as
he
was
of
the
gentleman
fame
in
town
placed
himself
entirely
and
instantly
at
his
disposal
though
the
hour
was
late
sounding
him
carefully
and
finding
the
fellow
most
amenable
to
any
scheme
that
should
achieve
the
salvation
of
his
purse
and
industries
blake
boldly
laid
his
plan
before
him
startled
at
first
newlington
upon
considering
it
became
so
enthusiastic
that
he
hailed
sir
rowland
as
his
deliverer
and
heartily
promised
his
cooperation
indeed
it
was
newlington
who
was
himself
to
take
the
first
step
well
pleased
with
his
evening
work
sir
rowland
went
home
to
lupton
house
and
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
broached
the
matter
to
richard
he
had
all
the
vanity
of
the
inferior
not
only
to
lessen
the
appearance
of
his
inferiority
but
to
clothe
himself
in
a
mantle
of
importance
and
it
was
this
vanity
urged
him
to
acquaint
richard
with
his
plans
in
the
very
presence
of
ruth
they
had
broken
their
fast
and
they
still
lingered
in
the
the
largest
and
most
important
room
in
lupton
house
it
was
cool
and
pleasant
here
in
contrast
to
the
heat
of
the
july
sun
which
following
upon
the
late
wet
weather
beat
fiercely
on
the
lawn
the
to
which
stood
open
the
cloth
had
been
raised
and
diana
and
her
mother
had
lately
left
the
room
ruth
in
the
at
a
small
oval
table
was
arranging
a
cluster
of
roses
in
an
old
bronze
bowl
sir
rowland
his
stiff
short
figure
carefully
dressed
in
a
suit
of
brown
camlet
his
fair
wig
very
carefully
curled
occupied
a
armchair
near
the
empty
fireplace
richard
perched
on
the
table
edge
swung
his
shapely
legs
idly
backwards
and
forwards
and
cogitated
upon
a
pretext
to
call
for
a
morning
draught
of
last
october
ale
ruth
completed
her
task
with
the
roses
and
turned
her
eyes
upon
her
brother
you
are
not
looking
well
richard
she
said
which
was
true
enough
for
much
hard
drinking
was
beginning
to
set
its
stamp
on
richard
and
young
as
he
was
his
insipidly
fair
face
began
to
display
a
bloatedness
that
was
exceedingly
unhealthy
oh
i
am
well
enough
he
answered
almost
peevishly
for
these
allusions
to
his
looks
were
becoming
more
frequent
than
he
savoured
gad
cried
sir
rowland
deep
voice
you
need
to
be
well
i
have
work
for
you
dick
did
not
appear
to
share
his
enthusiasm
i
am
sick
of
the
work
you
discover
for
us
rowland
he
answered
ungraciously
but
blake
showed
no
resentment
maybe
you
find
the
present
task
more
to
your
taste
if
it
deeds
of
you
pine
for
i
am
the
man
to
satisfy
he
smiled
grimly
his
bold
grey
eyes
glancing
across
at
ruth
who
was
observing
him
listening
richard
sneered
but
offered
him
no
encouragement
to
proceed
i
see
said
blake
that
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
before
you
credit
me
shalt
have
it
then
but
and
he
checked
on
the
word
his
face
growing
serious
his
eye
wandering
to
the
door
i
would
not
have
it
overheard
not
for
a
king
ransom
which
was
more
literally
true
than
he
may
have
intended
it
to
be
richard
looked
over
his
shoulder
carelessly
at
the
door
we
have
no
eavesdroppers
he
said
and
his
voice
bespoke
his
contempt
of
the
gravity
of
this
news
of
which
sir
rowland
made
so
much
in
anticipation
he
was
acquainted
with
sir
rowland
ways
and
the
importance
of
them
what
are
you
considering
he
inquired
to
end
the
rebellion
answered
blake
his
voice
cautiously
lowered
richard
laughed
outright
there
are
several
others
considering
that
notably
his
majesty
king
james
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
the
earl
of
feversham
yet
they
do
appear
to
achieve
it
is
in
that
particular
said
blake
complacently
that
i
shall
differ
from
he
turned
to
ruth
eager
to
engage
her
in
the
conversation
to
flatter
her
by
including
her
in
the
secret
knowing
the
loyalist
principles
she
entertained
he
had
no
reason
to
fear
that
his
plans
could
other
than
meet
her
approval
what
do
you
say
mistress
ruth
presuming
upon
his
friendship
with
her
brother
he
had
taken
to
calling
her
by
that
name
in
preference
to
the
other
which
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
give
her
is
it
not
an
object
worthy
of
a
endeavour
if
you
can
save
so
many
poor
people
from
encompassing
their
ruin
by
following
that
rash
young
man
the
duke
of
monmouth
you
will
indeed
be
doing
a
worthy
blake
rose
and
made
her
a
leg
madam
said
he
had
aught
been
wanting
to
cement
my
resolve
your
words
would
supply
it
to
me
my
plan
is
simplicity
itself
i
propose
to
capture
monmouth
and
his
principal
agents
and
deliver
them
over
to
the
king
and
that
is
a
mere
nothing
croaked
richard
could
more
be
needed
quoth
blake
once
the
rebel
army
is
deprived
of
its
leaders
it
will
melt
and
dissolve
of
itself
once
the
duke
is
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
fight
for
is
it
not
shrewd
you
are
telling
us
the
object
rather
than
the
plan
ruth
reminded
him
if
the
plan
is
as
good
as
the
object
as
good
he
echoed
chuckling
you
shall
and
briefly
he
sketched
for
her
the
springe
he
was
setting
with
the
help
of
newlington
newlington
is
rich
the
duke
is
in
straits
for
money
newlington
goes
to
offer
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
the
duke
is
to
do
him
the
honour
of
supping
at
his
house
night
to
fetch
the
money
it
is
a
reasonable
request
for
newlington
to
make
under
the
circumstances
and
the
duke
can
not
dare
not
refuse
but
how
will
that
advance
your
project
ruth
inquired
for
blake
had
paused
again
thinking
that
the
rest
must
be
obvious
in
newlington
orchard
i
propose
to
post
a
score
or
so
of
men
well
armed
oh
i
shall
run
no
risks
of
betrayal
by
engaging
bridgwater
folk
i
get
the
fellows
i
need
from
general
feversham
we
take
monmouth
at
supper
as
quietly
as
may
be
with
what
gentlemen
happen
to
have
accompanied
him
we
bind
and
gag
the
duke
and
we
convey
him
with
all
speed
and
quiet
out
of
bridgwater
feversham
shall
send
a
troop
to
await
me
a
mile
or
so
from
the
town
on
the
road
to
weston
zoyland
we
shall
join
them
with
our
captive
and
thus
convey
him
to
the
royalist
general
could
aught
be
simpler
or
more
infallible
richard
had
slipped
from
the
table
he
had
changed
his
mind
on
the
subject
of
the
importance
of
the
business
blake
had
in
view
excited
by
it
he
clapped
his
friend
on
the
back
approvingly
a
great
plan
he
cried
is
it
not
ruth
it
should
be
the
means
of
saving
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
lives
said
she
and
so
it
deserves
to
prosper
but
what
of
the
officers
who
may
be
with
the
duke
she
inquired
there
are
not
likely
to
be
many
half
a
dozen
say
we
shall
have
to
make
short
work
of
them
lest
they
should
raise
an
he
saw
her
glance
clouding
that
is
the
ugly
part
of
the
affair
he
was
quick
to
add
himself
assuming
a
look
of
sadness
he
sighed
what
help
is
there
he
asked
better
that
those
few
should
suffer
than
that
as
you
yourself
have
said
there
should
be
some
thousands
of
lives
lost
before
this
rebellion
is
put
down
besides
he
continued
monmouth
officers
are
ambitious
men
who
have
entered
into
this
affair
to
promote
their
own
personal
fortunes
they
are
gamesters
who
have
set
their
lives
upon
the
board
against
a
great
prize
and
they
know
it
but
these
other
poor
misguided
people
who
have
gone
out
to
fight
for
liberty
and
religion
it
is
these
whom
i
am
striving
to
his
words
sounded
fervent
his
sentiments
almost
heroic
ruth
looked
at
him
and
wondered
had
she
misjudged
him
in
the
past
she
sighed
then
she
thought
of
wilding
he
was
on
the
other
side
but
where
was
he
rumour
ran
that
he
was
dead
that
he
and
grey
had
quarrelled
at
lyme
and
that
wilding
had
been
killed
as
a
result
had
it
not
been
for
diana
who
strenuously
bade
her
attach
no
credit
to
these
reports
she
would
readily
have
believed
them
as
it
was
she
waited
wondering
thinking
of
him
always
as
she
had
seen
him
on
that
day
at
walford
when
he
had
taken
his
leave
of
her
and
more
than
once
when
she
pondered
the
words
he
had
said
the
look
that
had
invested
his
drooping
eyes
she
found
herself
with
tears
in
her
own
they
welled
up
now
and
she
rose
hastily
to
her
feet
she
looked
a
moment
at
blake
who
was
watching
her
keenly
speculating
upon
this
emotion
of
which
she
betrayed
some
sign
and
wondering
might
not
his
heroism
have
touched
her
for
as
we
have
seen
he
had
arrayed
a
deed
of
excessive
meanness
a
deed
worthy
almost
of
the
iscariot
in
the
panoply
of
heroic
achievement
i
think
she
said
that
you
are
setting
your
hand
to
a
very
worthy
and
glorious
enterprise
and
i
hope
nay
i
am
sure
that
success
must
attend
your
he
was
still
bowing
his
thanks
when
she
passed
out
through
the
open
into
the
sunshine
of
the
garden
sir
rowland
swung
round
upon
richard
a
great
enterprise
dick
he
cried
i
may
count
upon
you
for
one
aye
said
dick
who
had
found
at
last
the
pretext
that
he
needed
you
may
count
on
me
pull
the
bell
we
drink
to
the
success
of
the
chapter
xvii
wilding
return
the
preparations
to
be
made
for
the
momentous
coup
sir
rowland
meditated
were
considerable
newlington
was
yet
to
be
concerted
with
and
advised
and
that
done
sir
rowland
had
to
face
the
difficulty
of
eluding
the
bridgwater
guards
and
make
his
way
to
feversham
camp
at
somerton
to
enlist
the
general
cooperation
to
the
extent
that
we
have
seen
he
looked
for
that
done
he
was
to
return
and
ripen
his
preparations
for
the
business
he
had
undertaken
nevertheless
in
spite
of
all
that
lay
before
him
he
did
not
find
it
possible
to
leave
lupton
house
without
stepping
out
into
the
garden
in
quest
of
ruth
through
the
window
whilst
he
and
richard
were
at
their
ale
he
had
watched
her
between
whiles
and
had
lingered
waiting
for
diana
was
with
her
and
it
was
not
his
wish
to
seek
her
whilst
diana
was
at
hand
speak
with
her
ere
he
went
he
must
he
was
an
opportunist
and
now
he
fondly
imagined
was
his
opportunity
he
had
made
that
day
at
last
a
favourable
impression
upon
richard
sister
he
had
revealed
himself
in
an
heroic
light
and
egregiously
misreading
the
emotion
she
had
shown
before
withdrawing
he
was
satisfied
that
did
he
strike
now
victory
must
attend
him
he
sighed
his
satisfaction
and
pleasurable
anticipation
he
had
been
wary
and
he
had
known
how
to
wait
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
to
be
rewarded
for
his
patience
then
he
frowned
as
another
glance
showed
him
that
diana
still
lingered
with
her
cousin
he
wished
diana
at
the
devil
he
had
come
to
hate
this
doll
to
whom
he
had
once
paid
court
she
was
too
continually
in
his
way
a
constant
obstacle
in
his
path
ever
ready
to
remind
ruth
of
anthony
wilding
when
sir
rowland
most
desired
anthony
wilding
to
be
forgotten
and
in
feelings
towards
himself
such
a
change
had
been
gradually
wrought
that
she
had
come
to
reciprocate
his
sentiments
to
hate
him
with
all
the
bitter
hatred
into
which
love
can
be
by
scorn
transmuted
at
first
her
object
in
keeping
ruth
thoughts
on
wilding
in
pleading
his
cause
and
seeking
to
present
him
in
a
favourable
light
to
the
lady
whom
he
had
constrained
to
become
his
wife
had
been
that
he
might
stand
a
barrier
between
ruth
and
sir
rowland
to
the
end
that
diana
might
hope
to
see
revived
faute
de
mieux
since
possible
in
no
other
way
the
feelings
that
once
sir
rowland
had
professed
for
herself
the
situation
was
rich
in
humiliations
for
poor
vain
foolishly
crafty
diana
and
these
humiliations
were
daily
rendered
more
bitter
by
sir
rowland
unwavering
courtship
of
her
cousin
in
spite
of
all
that
she
could
do
in
the
end
the
poison
of
them
entered
her
soul
corroded
her
sentiments
towards
him
dissolved
the
love
she
had
borne
him
and
transformed
it
into
venom
she
would
not
have
him
now
if
he
did
penitence
for
his
disaffection
by
going
in
sackcloth
and
crawling
after
her
on
his
knees
for
a
full
twelvemonth
but
neither
should
he
have
ruth
if
she
could
thwart
his
purpose
on
that
she
was
resolved
had
she
but
guessed
that
he
watched
them
from
the
windows
waiting
for
her
to
take
her
departure
she
had
lingered
all
the
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
if
need
be
at
ruth
side
but
being
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
believing
that
he
had
already
left
the
house
she
presently
quitted
ruth
to
go
indoors
and
no
sooner
was
she
gone
than
there
was
blake
replacing
her
at
ruth
elbow
mistress
wilding
met
him
with
unsmiling
but
not
ungentle
face
not
yet
gone
sir
rowland
she
asked
him
and
a
less
sanguine
man
had
been
discouraged
by
the
words
it
may
be
forgiven
me
that
i
tarry
at
such
a
time
said
he
when
we
consider
that
i
go
perhaps
to
return
no
it
was
an
inspiration
on
his
part
to
assume
the
role
of
the
hero
going
forth
to
a
possible
death
it
invested
him
with
noble
valiant
pathos
which
could
not
he
thought
fail
of
its
effect
upon
a
woman
mind
but
he
looked
in
vain
for
a
change
of
colour
be
it
ever
so
slight
or
a
quickening
of
the
breath
he
found
neither
though
indeed
her
deep
blue
eyes
seemed
to
soften
as
they
observed
him
there
is
danger
in
this
thing
that
you
are
undertaking
said
she
between
question
and
assertion
it
is
not
my
wish
to
overstate
it
yet
i
leave
you
to
imagine
what
the
risk
may
it
is
a
good
cause
said
she
thinking
of
the
poor
deluded
humble
folk
that
followed
monmouth
banner
whom
blake
fine
action
was
to
rescue
from
impending
ruin
and
annihilation
and
surely
heaven
will
be
on
your
we
must
prevail
cried
blake
with
kindling
eye
and
you
had
thought
him
a
fanatic
not
a
miserable
earner
of
we
must
prevail
though
some
of
us
may
pay
dearly
for
the
victory
i
have
a
foreboding
he
paused
sighed
then
laughed
and
flung
back
his
head
as
if
throwing
off
some
weight
that
had
oppressed
him
it
was
admirably
played
nick
trenchard
had
he
observed
it
might
have
envied
the
performance
and
it
took
effect
with
her
this
adding
of
a
prospective
martyr
crown
to
the
hero
raiment
he
had
earlier
donned
it
was
a
worthy
of
one
who
was
deeply
learned
from
the
school
of
foul
experience
in
the
secret
ways
that
lead
to
a
favour
in
a
pursuit
of
this
kind
there
was
no
subterfuge
too
mean
no
treachery
too
base
for
sir
rowland
blake
will
you
walk
mistress
he
said
and
she
feeling
that
it
were
an
unkindness
not
to
do
his
will
assented
gravely
they
moved
down
the
sloping
lawn
side
by
side
sir
rowland
leaning
on
his
cane
bareheaded
his
feathered
hat
tucked
under
his
arm
before
them
the
river
smooth
expanse
swollen
and
yellow
with
the
recent
rains
glowed
like
a
sheet
of
copper
so
that
it
blurred
the
sight
to
look
upon
it
long
a
few
steps
they
took
with
no
word
uttered
then
sir
rowland
spoke
with
this
foreboding
that
is
on
me
said
he
i
could
not
go
without
seeing
you
without
saying
something
that
i
may
never
have
another
chance
of
saying
something
that
who
knows
but
for
the
emprise
to
which
i
am
now
wedded
you
had
never
heard
from
he
shot
her
a
furtive
sidelong
glance
from
under
his
heavy
beetling
brows
and
now
indeed
he
observed
a
change
ripple
over
the
composure
of
her
face
like
a
sudden
breeze
across
a
sheet
of
water
the
deep
lace
collar
at
her
throat
rose
and
fell
and
her
fingers
toyed
nervously
with
a
ribbon
of
her
grey
bodice
she
recovered
in
an
instant
and
threw
up
entrenchments
against
the
attack
she
saw
he
was
about
to
make
you
exaggerate
i
trust
said
she
your
forebodings
will
be
proved
groundless
you
will
return
safe
and
sound
from
this
venture
as
indeed
i
hope
you
that
was
his
cue
you
hope
it
he
cried
arresting
his
step
turning
and
imprisoning
her
left
hand
in
his
right
you
hope
it
ah
if
you
hope
for
my
return
return
i
will
but
unless
i
know
that
you
will
have
some
welcome
for
me
such
as
i
desire
from
you
i
think
his
voice
quivered
cleverly
i
think
perhaps
it
were
well
if
if
my
forebodings
were
not
as
groundless
as
you
say
they
are
tell
me
ruth
but
she
interrupted
him
it
was
high
time
she
thought
her
face
he
saw
was
flushed
her
eyes
had
hardened
somewhat
calmly
she
disengaged
her
hand
what
you
mean
she
asked
speak
sir
rowland
speak
plainly
that
i
may
give
you
a
plain
it
was
a
challenge
in
which
another
man
had
seen
how
hopeless
was
his
case
and
accepting
defeat
had
made
as
orderly
a
retreat
as
still
was
possible
but
sir
rowland
stricken
in
his
vanity
went
headlong
on
to
utter
rout
since
you
ask
me
in
such
terms
i
will
be
plain
indeed
he
answered
her
i
mean
he
almost
quailed
before
the
look
that
met
him
from
her
intrepid
eyes
do
you
not
see
my
meaning
ruth
that
which
i
see
said
she
i
do
not
believe
and
as
i
would
not
wrong
you
by
any
foolish
imaginings
i
would
have
you
plain
with
yet
the
egregious
fool
went
on
and
why
should
you
not
believe
your
senses
he
asked
her
between
anger
and
entreaty
is
it
wonderful
that
i
should
love
you
is
it
stop
she
drew
back
a
pace
from
him
there
was
a
moment
silence
during
which
it
seemed
she
gathered
her
forces
to
destroy
him
and
in
the
spirit
he
bowed
his
head
before
the
coming
storm
then
with
a
sudden
relaxing
of
the
stiffness
her
lissom
figure
had
assumed
i
think
you
had
better
leave
me
sir
rowland
she
advised
him
she
half
turned
and
moved
a
step
away
he
followed
with
lowering
glance
his
upper
lip
lifting
and
laying
bare
his
powerful
teeth
in
a
stride
he
was
beside
her
do
you
hate
me
ruth
he
asked
her
hoarsely
why
should
i
hate
you
she
sadly
i
do
not
even
dislike
you
she
continued
in
a
more
friendly
tone
adding
as
if
by
way
of
explaining
this
phenomenon
you
are
my
brother
friend
but
i
am
disappointed
in
you
sir
rowland
you
had
i
know
no
intention
of
offering
me
disrespect
and
yet
it
is
what
you
have
as
how
he
asked
knowing
me
another
wife
he
broke
in
tempestuously
a
mock
marriage
if
it
is
but
that
scruple
stands
between
us
i
think
there
is
more
she
answered
him
you
compel
me
to
hurt
you
i
do
so
as
the
surgeon
does
that
i
may
heal
why
thanks
for
nothing
he
made
answer
unable
to
repress
a
sneer
then
checking
himself
and
resuming
the
posture
i
go
mistress
he
told
her
sadly
and
if
i
lose
my
life
or
in
this
affair
i
shall
pray
for
you
said
she
for
she
had
found
him
out
at
last
perceived
the
nature
of
the
bow
he
sought
to
draw
across
her
and
having
perceived
it
contempt
awoke
in
her
he
had
attempted
to
move
her
by
unfair
insidious
means
he
fell
back
crimson
from
chin
to
brow
he
stifled
the
wrath
that
welled
up
threatening
to
choke
him
he
was
a
man
of
the
sort
as
trenchard
had
once
reminded
him
that
falls
a
prey
to
apoplexy
and
surely
he
was
never
nearer
it
than
at
that
moment
he
made
her
a
profound
bow
bending
himself
almost
in
two
before
her
in
a
very
irony
of
deference
then
drawing
himself
up
again
he
turned
and
left
her
the
plot
which
with
some
pride
he
had
hatched
and
the
reward
he
looked
to
cull
from
it
were
now
to
his
soul
as
ashes
to
his
lips
what
could
it
profit
him
to
destroy
monmouth
so
that
anthony
wilding
lived
for
whether
she
loved
wilding
or
not
she
was
wilding
wife
wilding
nominally
at
least
was
master
of
that
which
sir
rowland
coveted
not
her
heart
indeed
but
her
ample
fortune
wilding
had
been
a
to
him
since
he
had
come
to
bridgwater
but
for
wilding
he
might
have
run
a
smooth
course
he
was
still
fool
enough
to
hug
that
dear
illusion
to
his
soul
somewhere
in
england
if
not
dead
already
this
wilding
lurked
an
outlaw
whom
any
might
shoot
down
at
sight
sir
rowland
swore
he
would
not
rest
until
he
knew
that
anthony
wilding
cumbered
the
earth
no
more
leastways
not
the
surface
of
it
he
went
forth
to
seek
newlington
the
merchant
had
sent
his
message
to
the
rebel
king
and
had
word
in
answer
that
his
majesty
would
be
graciously
pleased
to
sup
at
newlington
at
nine
on
the
following
evening
attended
by
a
few
gentlemen
of
his
immediate
following
sir
rowland
received
the
news
with
satisfaction
and
sighed
to
think
that
wilding
still
absent
heaven
knew
where
would
not
be
of
the
party
it
was
reported
that
on
the
monday
monmouth
was
to
march
to
gloucester
hoping
there
to
be
joined
by
his
cheshire
friends
so
that
it
seemed
sir
rowland
had
not
matured
his
plan
a
day
too
soon
he
got
to
horse
and
contriving
to
win
out
of
bridgwater
rode
off
to
somerton
to
concert
with
lord
feversham
concerning
the
men
he
would
need
for
his
undertaking
that
night
richard
made
free
talk
of
the
undertaking
to
diana
and
to
ruth
loving
as
does
the
pusillanimous
to
show
himself
engaged
in
daring
enterprises
emulating
his
friend
sir
rowland
he
held
forth
with
prolixity
upon
the
great
service
he
was
to
do
the
state
and
ruth
listening
to
him
was
proud
of
his
zeal
the
sincerity
of
which
it
never
entered
her
mind
to
doubt
diana
listened
too
but
without
illusions
concerning
master
richard
and
she
kept
her
conclusions
to
herself
during
the
afternoon
of
the
morrow
which
was
sunday
sir
rowland
returned
to
bridgwater
his
mission
to
feversham
entirely
successful
and
all
preparations
made
he
completed
his
arrangements
and
towards
eight
that
night
the
twenty
men
sent
by
feversham
they
had
slipped
singly
into
the
town
began
to
muster
in
the
orchard
at
the
back
of
newlington
house
it
was
just
about
that
same
hour
that
wilding
and
in
every
pore
rode
into
bridgwater
and
made
his
way
to
the
sign
of
the
ship
in
the
high
street
overlooking
the
cross
where
trenchard
was
lodged
his
friend
was
absent
possibly
gone
with
his
men
to
the
sermon
ferguson
was
preaching
to
the
army
in
the
castle
fields
having
put
up
his
horse
wilding
all
dusty
as
he
was
repaired
straight
to
the
castle
to
report
himself
to
monmouth
he
was
informed
that
his
majesty
was
in
council
nevertheless
urging
that
his
news
was
of
importance
he
begged
to
be
instantly
announced
after
a
pause
he
was
ushered
into
a
lofty
roomy
chamber
where
in
the
fading
daylight
king
monmouth
sat
in
council
with
grey
and
wade
matthews
speke
ferguson
and
others
at
the
foot
of
the
table
stood
a
sturdy
unknown
to
wilding
it
was
godfrey
the
spy
who
was
to
act
as
their
guide
across
sedgemoor
that
night
for
the
matter
that
was
engaging
them
just
then
was
the
completion
of
their
plans
for
the
attack
that
was
to
be
made
that
very
night
upon
unprepared
camp
a
matter
which
had
been
resolved
during
the
last
few
hours
as
an
alternative
preferable
to
the
retreat
towards
gloucester
that
had
at
first
been
intended
wilding
was
shocked
at
the
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
appearance
during
the
few
weeks
since
last
he
had
seen
him
his
face
was
thin
pale
and
haggard
his
eyes
were
more
sombre
and
beneath
them
there
were
heavy
dark
stains
of
sleeplessness
and
care
his
very
voice
when
presently
he
spoke
seemed
to
have
lost
the
musical
timbre
that
had
earlier
distinguished
it
it
was
grown
harsh
and
rasping
disappointment
after
disappointment
set
down
to
but
in
reality
the
fruit
of
incompetence
had
served
to
sour
him
the
climax
had
been
reached
in
the
serious
desertions
after
the
philips
norton
fight
and
the
flight
of
paymaster
goodenough
with
the
funds
for
the
campaign
the
company
sat
about
the
long
oak
table
on
which
a
map
was
spread
and
colonel
wade
was
speaking
when
wilding
entered
on
his
appearance
wade
ceased
and
every
eye
was
turned
upon
the
messenger
from
london
ferguson
fresh
from
his
sermon
sat
with
elbows
resting
on
the
table
his
long
chin
supported
by
his
hands
his
eyes
gleaming
sharply
under
the
shadow
of
his
wig
which
was
pulled
down
in
front
to
the
level
of
his
eyebrows
it
was
the
duke
who
addressed
wilding
and
the
latter
keen
ears
were
quick
to
catch
the
bitterness
that
underlay
his
words
we
are
glad
to
see
you
sir
we
had
not
looked
to
do
so
not
looked
to
do
so
your
gr
majesty
he
echoed
plainly
not
understanding
and
it
was
observed
that
he
stumbled
over
the
duke
new
title
we
had
imagined
that
the
pleasures
of
the
town
were
claiming
your
entire
wilding
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
before
him
and
on
the
face
of
all
he
saw
a
gravity
that
amounted
to
disapproval
of
him
the
pleasures
of
the
town
said
he
frowning
and
again
the
pleasures
of
the
town
there
is
something
in
this
that
i
fear
i
do
not
do
you
bring
us
news
that
london
has
risen
asked
grey
suddenly
i
would
i
could
said
wilding
smiling
wistfully
is
it
a
laughing
matter
quoth
grey
angrily
a
smiling
matter
my
lord
answered
wilding
nettled
your
lordship
will
observe
that
i
did
but
mr
wilding
said
monmouth
darkly
we
are
not
pleased
with
in
that
case
returned
wilding
more
and
more
irritated
your
majesty
expected
of
me
more
than
was
possible
to
any
you
have
wasted
your
time
in
london
sir
the
duke
explained
we
sent
you
thither
counting
upon
your
loyalty
and
devotion
to
ourselves
what
have
you
done
as
much
as
a
man
could
wilding
began
when
grey
again
interrupted
him
as
little
as
a
man
could
he
answered
were
his
grace
not
the
most
foolishly
clement
prince
in
christendom
a
halter
would
be
your
reward
for
the
fine
things
you
have
done
in
wilding
stiffened
visibly
his
long
white
face
grew
set
and
his
slanting
eyes
looked
wicked
he
was
not
a
man
readily
moved
to
anger
but
to
be
greeted
in
such
words
as
these
by
one
who
constituted
himself
the
mouthpiece
of
him
for
whom
wilding
had
incurred
ruin
was
more
than
he
could
bear
with
equanimity
that
the
risks
to
which
he
had
exposed
himself
in
london
where
indeed
he
had
been
in
almost
hourly
expectation
of
arrest
and
such
short
shrift
as
poor
disney
had
should
be
acknowledged
in
such
terms
as
these
was
something
that
turned
him
almost
sick
with
disgust
to
what
manner
of
men
had
he
leagued
himself
he
looked
grey
steadily
between
the
eyes
i
mind
me
of
an
occasion
on
which
such
a
charge
of
foolish
clemency
might
indeed
and
with
greater
justice
have
been
levelled
against
his
majesty
said
he
and
his
calm
was
almost
terrible
his
lordship
grew
pale
at
the
obvious
allusion
to
monmouth
mild
treatment
of
him
for
his
cowardice
at
bridport
and
his
eyes
were
as
baleful
as
wilding
own
at
that
moment
but
before
he
could
speak
monmouth
had
already
answered
wilding
you
are
wanting
in
respect
to
us
sir
he
admonished
him
wilding
bowed
to
the
rebuke
in
a
submission
that
seemed
ironical
the
blood
mounted
slowly
to
monmouth
cheeks
perhaps
put
in
wade
who
was
anxious
for
peace
mr
wilding
has
some
explanation
to
offer
us
of
his
his
failure
they
took
too
much
for
granted
stitched
in
the
lining
of
his
boot
was
the
letter
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
have
achieved
that
was
surely
to
have
achieved
something
i
thank
you
sir
for
supposing
it
answered
wilding
his
voice
hard
with
i
have
indeed
an
we
will
hear
it
said
monmouth
condescendingly
and
grey
sneered
thrusting
out
his
bloated
lips
i
have
to
offer
the
explanation
that
your
majesty
is
served
in
london
by
cowards
and
cowards
who
have
hindered
me
in
my
task
instead
of
helping
me
i
refer
particularly
to
colonel
grey
interrupted
him
you
have
a
rare
effrontery
sir
aye
by
god
do
you
dare
call
danvers
a
coward
it
is
not
i
who
so
call
him
but
the
facts
colonel
danvers
has
run
away
danvers
gone
cried
ferguson
voicing
the
consternation
of
all
wilding
shrugged
and
smiled
grey
eye
was
offensively
upon
him
he
elected
to
answer
the
challenge
of
that
glance
he
has
followed
the
illustrious
example
set
him
by
other
of
your
majesty
devoted
followers
said
wilding
grey
rose
suddenly
this
was
too
much
i
not
endure
it
from
this
knave
he
cried
appealing
to
monmouth
monmouth
wearily
waved
him
to
a
seat
but
grey
disregarded
the
command
what
have
i
said
that
should
touch
your
lordship
asked
wilding
and
smiling
sardonically
he
looked
into
grey
eyes
it
is
not
what
you
have
said
it
is
what
you
have
and
to
call
me
knave
said
wilding
in
a
mocking
horror
the
repression
of
his
anger
lent
him
a
rare
bitterness
and
an
almost
devilishly
subtle
manner
of
expressing
wordlessly
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
there
was
not
one
present
but
gathered
from
his
utterance
of
those
five
words
that
he
did
not
hold
grey
worthy
the
honour
of
being
called
to
account
for
that
offensive
epithet
he
made
just
an
exclamatory
protest
such
as
he
might
have
made
had
a
woman
applied
the
term
to
him
grey
turned
from
him
slowly
to
monmouth
it
might
be
well
said
he
in
his
turn
controlling
himself
at
last
to
place
wilding
under
wilding
manner
quickened
on
the
instant
from
passive
to
active
anger
upon
what
charge
sir
he
demanded
sharply
in
truth
it
was
the
only
thing
wanting
that
after
all
that
he
had
undergone
he
should
be
arrested
his
eyes
were
upon
the
duke
melancholy
face
and
his
anger
was
such
that
in
that
moment
he
vowed
that
if
monmouth
acted
upon
this
suggestion
of
grey
he
should
not
have
so
much
as
the
consolation
of
sunderland
letter
you
have
been
wanting
in
respect
to
us
sir
the
duke
answered
him
he
seemed
able
to
do
little
more
than
repeat
himself
you
return
from
london
your
task
unaccomplished
and
instead
of
a
becoming
contrition
you
hector
it
here
before
us
in
this
he
shook
his
head
we
are
not
pleased
with
you
but
your
grace
exclaimed
wilding
is
it
my
fault
that
your
london
agents
had
failed
to
organize
the
rising
that
rising
should
have
taken
place
and
it
would
have
taken
place
had
your
majesty
been
more
ably
represented
you
were
there
wilding
said
grey
with
heavy
sarcasm
would
it
no
be
better
to
leave
wilding
affair
until
afterwards
suggested
ferguson
at
that
moment
it
is
already
past
eight
your
majesty
and
there
be
still
some
details
of
this
attack
to
settle
that
your
officers
may
prepare
for
it
whilst
newlington
awaits
your
majesty
to
supper
at
true
said
monmouth
ever
ready
to
take
a
solution
offered
by
another
we
will
confer
with
you
again
later
wilding
bowed
accepting
his
dismissal
before
i
go
your
majesty
there
are
certain
things
i
would
report
he
began
you
have
heard
sir
grey
broke
in
not
now
this
is
not
the
indeed
no
this
is
not
the
time
wilding
echoed
the
duke
wilding
set
his
teeth
in
the
intensity
of
his
vexation
what
i
have
to
tell
your
majesty
is
of
importance
he
exclaimed
and
monmouth
seemed
to
waver
whilst
grey
looked
disdainful
unbelief
of
the
importance
of
any
communication
wilding
might
have
to
make
we
have
little
time
your
majesty
ferguson
reminded
monmouth
perhaps
put
in
friendly
wade
your
majesty
might
see
wilding
at
is
it
really
necessary
quoth
grey
this
treatment
of
him
inspired
wilding
with
malice
the
mere
mention
of
sunderland
letter
would
have
changed
their
tone
but
he
elected
by
no
such
word
to
urge
the
importance
of
his
business
it
should
be
entirely
as
monmouth
should
elect
or
be
constrained
by
these
gentlemen
about
his
it
would
serve
two
purposes
said
wade
whilst
monmouth
still
considered
your
majesty
will
be
none
too
well
attended
your
officers
having
this
other
matter
to
prepare
for
wilding
would
form
another
to
swell
your
escort
of
i
think
you
are
right
colonel
wade
said
monmouth
we
sup
at
newlington
at
nine
wilding
we
shall
expect
you
to
attend
us
there
lieutenant
cragg
said
his
grace
to
the
young
officer
who
had
admitted
wilding
and
who
had
remained
at
attention
by
the
door
you
may
reconduct
wilding
bowed
his
lips
tight
to
keep
in
the
anger
that
craved
expression
then
without
another
word
spoken
he
turned
and
departed
an
insolent
overbearing
knave
was
grey
comment
upon
him
after
he
had
left
the
room
let
us
attend
to
this
your
lordship
said
speke
tapping
the
map
time
presses
and
he
invited
wade
to
continue
the
matter
that
wilding
advent
had
interrupted
chapter
xviii
betrayal
still
smarting
under
the
cavalier
treatment
he
had
received
wilding
came
forth
from
the
castle
to
find
trenchard
awaiting
him
among
the
crowd
of
officers
and
men
that
thronged
the
yard
nick
linked
his
arm
through
his
friend
and
led
him
away
they
quitted
the
place
in
silence
and
in
silence
took
their
way
south
towards
the
high
street
nick
waiting
for
wilding
to
speak
wilding
mind
still
in
turmoil
at
the
things
he
had
endured
at
last
nick
halted
suddenly
and
looked
keenly
at
his
friend
in
the
failing
light
what
a
plague
ails
you
tony
said
he
sharply
you
are
as
silent
as
i
am
impatient
for
your
wilding
told
him
in
brief
disdainful
terms
of
the
reception
they
had
given
him
at
the
castle
and
of
how
they
had
blamed
him
for
the
circumstance
that
london
had
failed
to
proclaim
itself
for
monmouth
trenchard
snarled
viciously
is
that
mongrel
grey
said
he
oh
anthony
to
what
an
affair
have
we
set
our
hands
naught
can
prosper
with
that
fellow
in
he
laid
his
hand
on
wilding
arm
and
lowered
his
voice
as
i
have
hinted
before
not
surprise
me
if
time
proved
him
a
traitor
failure
attends
him
everywhere
and
so
unfailingly
that
one
wonders
is
not
failure
invited
by
him
and
that
fool
monmouth
pshaw
see
what
it
is
to
serve
a
weakling
with
another
in
his
place
and
the
country
disaffected
as
it
is
we
had
been
masters
of
england
by
two
ladies
passed
them
at
that
moment
cloaked
and
hooded
walking
briskly
one
of
them
turned
to
look
at
trenchard
who
waving
his
arms
in
wild
gesticulation
was
a
conspicuous
object
she
checked
in
her
walk
arresting
her
companion
mr
wilding
she
exclaimed
it
was
lady
horton
mr
wilding
cried
diana
her
companion
wilding
doffed
his
hat
and
bowed
trenchard
following
his
example
we
had
scarce
looked
to
see
you
in
bridgwater
again
said
the
mother
her
mild
pleasant
countenance
reflecting
the
satisfaction
it
gave
her
to
behold
him
safe
and
sound
there
have
been
moments
answered
wilding
when
myself
i
scarce
expected
to
return
your
ladyship
greeting
shows
me
what
i
had
lost
had
i
not
done
you
are
but
newly
arrived
quoth
diana
scanning
him
in
the
gloaming
from
london
an
hour
an
hour
she
echoed
and
observed
that
he
was
still
booted
and
you
will
have
been
to
lupton
house
a
shadow
crossed
his
face
his
glance
seemed
to
grow
clouded
all
of
which
watchful
diana
did
not
fail
to
observe
not
yet
said
he
you
are
a
laggard
she
laughed
at
him
and
he
felt
the
blood
driven
back
upon
his
heart
what
did
she
mean
was
it
possible
she
suggested
that
he
should
be
welcome
that
his
wife
feelings
towards
him
had
undergone
a
change
his
last
parting
from
her
on
the
road
near
walford
had
been
ever
in
his
mind
i
have
had
weighty
business
to
transact
he
replied
and
trenchard
snorted
his
mind
flying
back
to
the
at
the
castle
and
what
his
friend
had
told
him
but
now
that
you
have
disposed
of
that
you
will
sup
with
us
said
lady
horton
who
was
convinced
that
since
ruth
had
gone
to
the
altar
with
him
he
was
ruth
lover
in
spite
of
the
odd
things
she
had
heard
appearances
with
lady
horton
counted
for
everything
and
all
that
glittered
was
gold
to
her
i
would
he
answered
but
that
i
am
to
sup
at
newlington
with
his
majesty
my
visit
must
wait
until
let
us
hope
said
trenchard
that
it
waits
no
he
was
already
instructed
touching
the
night
attack
on
feversham
camp
on
sedgemoor
and
thought
it
likely
wilding
would
accompany
them
you
are
going
to
newlington
said
diana
and
trenchard
thought
she
had
turned
singularly
pale
her
hand
was
over
her
heart
her
eyes
wide
she
seemed
about
to
add
something
but
checked
herself
she
took
her
mother
arm
we
are
detaining
wilding
mother
said
she
and
her
voice
quivered
as
if
her
whole
being
were
shaken
by
some
gusty
agitation
they
spoke
their
farewells
briefly
and
moved
on
a
second
later
diana
was
back
at
their
side
again
where
are
you
lodged
wilding
she
inquired
with
my
friend
trenchard
at
the
sign
of
the
ship
by
the
she
briefly
acknowledged
the
information
rejoined
her
mother
and
hurried
away
with
her
trenchard
stood
staring
after
them
a
moment
odd
said
he
did
you
mark
that
girl
discomposure
but
wilding
thoughts
were
elsewhere
come
nick
if
i
am
to
render
myself
fit
to
sit
at
table
with
monmouth
we
need
to
they
went
their
way
but
not
so
fast
as
went
diana
urging
with
her
her
protesting
and
mother
where
is
your
mistress
the
girl
asked
excitedly
of
the
first
servant
she
met
at
lupton
house
in
her
room
madam
the
man
replied
and
to
ruth
room
went
diana
breathlessly
leaving
lady
horton
gaping
after
her
and
understanding
nothing
ruth
who
was
seated
pensive
by
her
window
rose
on
diana
impetuous
entrance
and
in
the
deepening
twilight
she
looked
almost
ghostly
in
her
gown
of
shimmering
white
satin
sewn
with
pearls
about
the
neck
of
the
bodice
diana
she
cried
you
startled
not
so
much
as
i
am
yet
to
do
answered
diana
breathing
excitement
she
threw
back
the
wimple
from
her
head
and
pulling
away
her
cloak
tossed
it
on
to
the
bed
mr
wilding
is
in
bridgwater
she
announced
there
was
a
faint
rustle
from
the
stiff
satin
of
ruth
gown
then
her
voice
shook
slightly
then
he
is
not
dead
she
said
more
because
she
felt
that
she
must
say
something
than
because
her
words
fitted
the
occasion
not
yet
said
diana
grimly
not
yet
he
sups
at
newlington
miss
horton
exclaimed
in
a
voice
pregnant
with
meaning
ah
it
was
a
cry
from
ruth
sharp
as
if
she
had
been
stabbed
she
sank
back
to
her
seat
by
the
window
smitten
down
by
this
sudden
news
there
was
a
pause
which
fretted
diana
who
now
craved
knowledge
of
what
might
be
passing
in
her
cousin
mind
she
advanced
towards
ruth
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
her
shoulder
where
the
white
gown
met
the
ivory
neck
he
must
be
warned
she
said
but
but
how
stammered
ruth
to
warn
him
were
to
betray
sir
sir
rowland
cried
diana
in
high
scorn
and
and
richard
ruth
continued
yes
and
newlington
and
all
the
other
knaves
that
are
engaged
in
this
murderous
business
well
she
demanded
will
you
do
it
or
must
i
do
it
ruth
eyes
sought
her
cousin
white
excited
face
in
the
but
have
you
thought
of
what
it
will
mean
have
you
thought
of
the
poor
people
that
will
perish
unless
the
duke
is
taken
and
this
rebellion
brought
to
an
end
thought
of
it
repeated
diana
witheringly
not
i
have
thought
that
wilding
is
here
and
like
to
have
his
throat
cut
before
an
hour
is
tell
me
are
you
sure
of
this
asked
ruth
i
have
it
from
your
husband
own
lips
diana
answered
and
told
her
in
a
few
words
of
her
meeting
with
wilding
ruth
sat
with
hands
folded
in
her
lap
her
eyes
on
the
dim
violet
in
the
west
and
her
mind
wrestling
with
this
problem
that
diana
had
brought
her
diana
she
cried
at
last
what
am
i
to
do
do
echoed
diana
is
it
not
plain
warn
but
richard
mr
wilding
saved
richard
life
i
know
i
know
my
duty
is
to
warn
then
why
hesitate
my
duty
is
also
to
keep
faith
with
richard
to
think
of
those
poor
misguided
folk
who
are
to
be
saved
by
this
cried
ruth
in
an
agony
if
wilding
is
warned
they
will
all
be
diana
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
had
i
thought
to
find
you
in
this
mind
i
had
warned
him
myself
said
she
ah
why
did
you
not
that
the
chance
of
doing
so
might
be
yours
that
you
might
thus
repay
him
the
debt
in
which
you
diana
i
ca
the
words
broke
from
her
in
a
sob
but
whatever
her
interest
in
wilding
for
her
own
sake
diana
prime
intent
was
the
thwarting
of
sir
rowland
blake
if
wilding
were
warned
of
what
manner
of
feast
was
spread
at
newlington
sir
rowland
would
be
indeed
undone
you
think
of
richard
she
exclaimed
and
you
know
that
richard
is
to
have
no
active
part
in
the
affair
that
he
will
run
no
risk
they
have
assigned
him
but
a
sentry
duty
that
he
may
warn
blake
and
his
followers
if
any
danger
threatens
it
is
not
of
richard
life
i
am
thinking
but
of
his
honour
of
his
trust
in
me
to
warn
wilding
were
to
commit
an
act
of
and
is
wilding
to
be
slaughtered
with
his
friends
diana
asked
her
resolve
me
that
time
presses
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
too
that
allusion
to
the
shortness
of
the
time
brought
ruth
an
inspiration
suddenly
she
saw
a
way
wilding
should
be
saved
and
yet
she
would
not
break
faith
with
richard
nor
ruin
those
others
she
would
detain
him
and
whilst
warning
him
at
the
last
moment
in
time
for
him
to
save
himself
not
do
so
until
it
must
be
too
late
for
him
to
warn
the
others
thus
she
would
do
her
duty
by
him
and
yet
keep
faith
with
richard
and
sir
rowland
she
had
resolved
she
thought
the
awful
difficulty
that
had
confronted
her
she
rose
suddenly
heartened
by
the
thought
give
me
your
cloak
and
wimple
she
bade
diana
and
diana
flew
to
do
her
bidding
where
is
wilding
lodged
she
asked
at
the
sign
of
the
ship
overlooking
the
cross
with
trenchard
shall
i
come
with
you
no
answered
ruth
without
hesitation
i
will
go
she
drew
the
wimple
well
over
her
head
so
that
in
its
shadows
her
face
might
lie
concealed
and
hid
her
shimmering
white
dress
under
diana
cloak
she
hastened
through
the
streets
never
heeding
the
rough
cobbles
that
hurt
her
feet
shod
in
light
indoor
wear
never
heeding
the
crowds
that
thronged
her
way
all
bridgwater
was
astir
with
presence
moreover
there
had
been
great
incursions
from
taunton
and
the
surrounding
country
the
of
the
followers
having
come
that
day
to
bridgwater
to
say
farewell
to
father
and
son
husband
and
brother
before
the
army
marched
as
was
still
believed
to
gloucester
the
was
striking
from
saint
mary
the
church
in
which
she
had
been
married
as
ruth
reached
the
door
of
the
sign
of
the
ship
she
was
about
to
knock
when
suddenly
it
opened
and
wilding
himself
with
trenchard
immediately
behind
him
stood
confronting
her
at
sight
of
him
a
momentary
weakness
took
her
he
had
changed
from
his
into
a
suit
of
roughly
corded
black
silk
which
threw
into
relief
the
steely
litheness
of
his
spare
figure
his
dark
brown
hair
was
carefully
dressed
diamonds
gleamed
in
the
cravat
of
snowy
lace
at
his
throat
he
was
uncovered
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
he
stood
aside
to
make
way
for
her
imagining
that
she
was
some
woman
of
the
house
mr
wilding
said
she
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
throat
may
i
may
i
speak
with
you
he
leaned
forward
seeking
to
pierce
the
shadows
of
her
wimple
he
had
thought
he
recognized
the
voice
as
his
sudden
start
had
shown
and
yet
he
disbelieved
his
ears
she
moved
her
head
at
that
moment
and
the
light
streaming
out
from
a
lamp
in
the
passage
beat
upon
her
white
face
ruth
he
cried
and
came
quickly
forward
trenchard
behind
him
looked
on
and
scowled
with
sudden
impatience
philanderings
with
this
lady
had
never
had
the
old
rake
approval
too
much
trouble
already
had
resulted
from
them
i
must
speak
with
you
at
once
at
once
she
urged
him
her
tone
fearful
are
you
in
need
of
me
he
asked
concernedly
in
very
urgent
need
said
she
i
thank
god
he
answered
without
flippancy
you
shall
find
me
at
your
service
tell
not
here
not
here
she
answered
him
where
else
said
he
shall
we
walk
no
her
repetitions
marked
the
deep
excitement
that
possessed
her
i
will
go
in
with
and
she
signed
with
her
head
towards
the
door
from
which
he
was
barely
emerged
scarce
fitting
said
he
for
being
confused
and
full
of
speculation
on
the
score
of
her
need
he
had
for
the
moment
almost
overlooked
the
relations
in
which
they
stood
in
spite
of
the
ceremony
through
which
they
had
gone
together
wilding
still
mostly
thought
of
her
as
of
a
mistress
very
difficult
to
woo
fitting
she
echoed
and
then
after
a
pause
am
i
not
your
wife
she
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
her
cheeks
crimsoning
ha
honour
i
had
almost
forgot
said
he
and
though
the
burden
of
his
words
seemed
mocking
their
tone
was
sad
of
the
that
jostled
them
a
couple
had
now
paused
to
watch
a
scene
that
had
an
element
of
the
unusual
in
it
she
pulled
her
wimple
closer
to
her
face
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
with
her
into
the
house
close
the
door
she
bade
him
and
trenchard
who
had
stood
aside
that
they
might
pass
in
forestalled
him
in
obeying
her
now
lead
me
to
your
room
said
she
and
wilding
in
amaze
turned
to
trenchard
as
if
asking
his
consent
for
the
lodging
after
all
was
trenchard
i
wait
here
said
nick
and
waved
his
hand
towards
an
oak
bench
that
stood
in
the
passage
you
had
best
make
haste
he
urged
his
friend
you
are
late
already
that
is
unless
you
are
of
a
mind
to
set
the
lady
affairs
before
king
monmouth
and
were
i
in
your
place
anthony
faith
i
not
scruple
to
do
it
for
after
all
he
added
under
his
breath
there
little
choice
in
rotten
ruth
waited
for
some
answer
from
wilding
that
might
suggest
he
was
indifferent
whether
he
went
to
newlington
or
not
but
he
spoke
no
word
as
he
turned
to
lead
the
way
to
the
indifferent
parlour
which
with
the
adjoining
bedroom
constituted
lodging
and
his
own
for
the
time
being
having
assured
herself
that
the
curtains
were
closely
drawn
she
put
by
her
cloak
and
hood
and
stood
revealed
to
him
in
the
light
of
the
three
candles
burning
in
a
branch
upon
the
bare
oak
table
dazzlingly
beautiful
in
her
gown
of
he
stood
apart
cogitating
her
with
glowing
eyes
the
faintest
smile
between
question
and
pleasure
hovering
about
his
thin
mouth
he
had
closed
the
door
and
stood
in
silence
waiting
for
her
to
make
known
to
him
her
pleasure
mr
wilding
she
began
and
straightway
he
interrupted
her
but
a
moment
since
you
did
remind
me
that
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
husband
he
said
with
grave
humour
why
seek
now
to
overcloud
that
fact
i
mind
me
that
the
last
time
we
met
you
called
me
by
another
name
but
it
may
be
he
added
as
an
afterthought
you
are
of
opinion
that
i
have
broken
faith
with
broken
faith
as
how
so
he
said
and
sighed
my
words
were
of
so
little
account
that
they
have
been
i
see
forgotten
yet
so
that
i
remember
them
that
is
what
chiefly
matters
i
promised
then
or
seemed
to
promise
that
i
would
make
a
widow
of
you
who
had
made
a
wife
of
you
against
your
will
it
has
not
happened
yet
do
not
despair
this
monmouth
quarrel
is
not
yet
fought
out
hope
on
my
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
lustrous
eyes
of
sapphire
in
a
face
of
ivory
a
faint
smile
parted
her
lips
the
reflection
of
the
thought
in
her
mind
that
had
she
indeed
been
eager
for
his
death
she
would
not
be
with
him
at
this
moment
had
she
desired
it
how
easy
would
her
course
have
been
you
do
me
wrong
to
bid
me
hope
for
that
she
answered
him
her
tones
level
i
do
not
wish
the
death
of
any
man
unless
she
paused
her
truthfulness
urged
her
too
far
unless
said
he
brows
raised
polite
interest
on
his
face
unless
it
be
his
grace
of
he
considered
her
with
suddenly
narrowed
eyes
you
have
not
by
chance
sought
me
to
talk
politics
said
he
or
and
he
suddenly
caught
his
breath
his
nostrils
dilating
with
rage
at
the
bare
thought
that
leapt
into
his
mind
had
monmouth
the
notorious
libertine
been
to
lupton
house
and
persecuted
her
with
his
addresses
is
it
that
you
are
acquainted
with
his
grace
he
asked
i
have
never
spoken
to
him
she
answered
with
no
suspicion
of
what
was
in
his
thoughts
in
his
relief
he
laughed
remembering
now
that
monmouth
affairs
were
too
absorbing
just
at
present
to
leave
him
room
for
dalliance
but
you
are
standing
said
he
and
he
advanced
a
chair
i
deplore
that
i
have
no
better
hospitality
to
offer
you
i
doubt
if
i
ever
shall
again
i
am
told
that
albemarle
did
me
the
honour
to
stable
his
knackers
in
my
hall
at
she
took
the
chair
he
offered
her
sinking
to
it
like
one
physically
weary
a
thing
he
was
quick
to
notice
he
watched
her
his
body
eager
his
soul
trammelling
it
with
a
steely
restraint
tell
me
now
said
he
in
what
you
need
she
was
silent
a
moment
pondering
hesitation
and
confusion
seeming
to
envelop
her
a
pink
flush
rose
to
colour
the
beautiful
pillar
of
neck
and
overspread
the
delicate
face
he
watched
it
wondering
how
long
she
asked
him
her
whole
intent
at
present
being
to
delay
him
and
gain
time
how
long
have
you
been
in
bridgwater
two
hours
at
most
said
he
two
hours
and
yet
you
never
came
to
to
me
i
heard
of
your
presence
and
i
feared
you
might
intend
to
abstain
from
seeking
he
almost
held
his
breath
while
she
spoke
caught
in
amazement
he
was
standing
close
beside
her
chair
his
right
hand
rested
upon
its
tall
back
did
you
so
intend
she
asked
him
i
told
you
even
now
he
answered
with
calm
that
i
had
made
you
a
sort
of
i
i
would
not
have
you
keep
it
she
murmured
she
heard
his
sharply
indrawn
breath
felt
him
leaning
over
her
and
was
filled
with
an
unaccountable
fear
was
it
to
tell
me
this
you
came
he
asked
her
his
voice
reduced
to
a
whisper
no
yes
she
answered
an
agony
in
her
mind
which
groped
for
some
means
to
keep
him
by
her
side
until
his
danger
should
be
overpast
that
much
she
owed
him
in
honour
if
in
nothing
else
no
yes
he
echoed
and
he
had
drawn
himself
erect
again
what
you
mean
ruth
i
mean
that
it
was
that
yet
not
quite
only
ah
disappointment
vibrated
faintly
in
his
clamation
what
else
i
would
have
you
abandon
monmouth
following
she
told
him
he
stared
a
moment
moved
away
and
round
where
he
could
confront
her
the
flush
had
now
faded
from
her
face
this
he
observed
and
the
heave
of
her
bosom
in
its
low
bodice
he
knit
his
brows
perplexed
here
was
surely
more
than
at
first
might
seem
why
so
he
asked
for
your
own
safety
sake
she
answered
him
you
are
oddly
concerned
for
that
concerned
not
she
paused
an
instant
swallowed
hard
and
then
continued
i
am
concerned
too
for
your
honour
and
there
is
no
honour
in
following
his
banner
he
has
crowned
himself
king
and
so
proved
himself
a
who
came
dissembled
as
the
champion
of
a
cause
that
he
might
delude
poor
ignorant
folk
into
flocking
to
his
standard
and
helping
him
to
his
ambitious
you
are
wondrously
well
schooled
said
he
whose
teachings
do
you
recite
me
sir
rowland
blake
at
another
time
the
sneer
might
have
cut
her
at
the
moment
she
was
too
intent
upon
gaining
time
the
means
to
it
mattered
little
the
more
she
talked
to
no
purpose
the
more
at
random
was
their
discourse
the
better
would
her
ends
be
served
sir
rowland
blake
she
cried
what
is
he
to
me
ah
what
let
me
set
you
the
question
less
than
nothing
she
assured
him
and
for
some
moments
afterwards
it
was
this
sir
rowland
who
served
them
as
a
topic
for
their
odd
interview
on
the
overmantel
the
pulse
of
time
beat
on
from
a
little
wooden
clock
his
eyes
strayed
to
it
it
marked
the
he
bethought
him
suddenly
of
his
engagement
trenchard
supremely
indifferent
whether
wilding
went
to
newlington
or
not
smoked
on
entirely
unconcerned
by
the
flight
of
time
mistress
said
wilding
suddenly
you
have
not
yet
told
me
in
what
you
seek
my
service
indeed
we
seem
to
have
talked
to
little
purpose
my
time
is
very
where
are
you
going
she
asked
him
and
fearfully
she
shot
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
timepiece
it
was
still
too
soon
by
at
least
five
minutes
he
smiled
but
his
smile
was
singular
he
began
to
suspect
at
last
that
her
only
purpose
to
what
end
he
could
not
guess
was
to
detain
him
is
a
singularly
sudden
interest
in
my
doings
this
said
he
quietly
what
you
seek
of
me
he
reached
for
the
hat
he
had
cast
upon
the
table
when
they
had
entered
tell
me
briefly
i
may
stay
no
she
rose
her
agitation
suddenly
increasing
afraid
that
after
all
he
would
escape
her
where
are
you
going
she
asked
answer
me
that
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
i
am
to
sup
at
newlington
in
his
majesty
company
his
majesty
king
monmouth
he
explained
impatiently
come
ruth
already
i
am
if
i
were
to
ask
you
not
to
go
she
said
slowly
and
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
her
glance
most
piteous
and
that
was
not
acting
as
she
raised
it
to
meet
his
own
would
you
not
stay
to
pleasure
me
he
considered
her
from
under
frowning
eyes
ruth
he
said
and
he
took
her
hands
there
is
here
something
that
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
to
newlington
and
i
will
tell
but
what
has
newlington
to
do
with
nay
i
am
pledged
already
to
she
drew
closer
to
him
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
yet
if
i
ask
you
i
your
wife
she
pleaded
and
almost
won
him
to
her
will
but
suddenly
he
remembered
another
occasion
on
which
for
purposes
of
her
own
she
had
so
pleaded
he
laughed
softly
mockingly
do
you
woo
me
ruth
who
when
i
wooed
you
would
have
none
of
me
she
drew
back
from
him
crimsoning
i
think
i
had
better
go
said
she
you
have
nothing
but
mockery
for
me
it
was
ever
so
who
knows
she
sighed
as
she
took
up
her
mantle
had
you
but
observed
more
gentle
ways
you
you
she
paused
needing
to
say
no
more
she
ended
and
made
shift
to
leave
he
watched
her
deeply
mystified
she
had
gained
the
door
when
suddenly
he
moved
wait
he
cried
she
paused
and
turned
to
look
over
her
shoulder
her
hand
apparently
upon
the
latch
you
shall
not
go
until
you
have
told
me
why
you
besought
me
to
keep
away
from
newlington
what
is
it
he
asked
and
paused
suddenly
a
flood
of
light
breaking
in
upon
his
mind
is
there
some
treachery
afoot
he
asked
her
and
his
eye
went
wildly
to
the
clock
a
harsh
grating
sound
rang
through
the
room
what
are
you
doing
he
cried
why
have
you
locked
the
door
she
was
tugging
and
fumbling
desperately
to
extract
the
key
her
hands
all
clumsy
in
her
nervous
haste
he
leapt
at
her
but
in
that
moment
the
key
came
away
in
her
hand
she
wheeled
round
to
face
him
erect
defiant
almost
here
is
some
devilry
he
cried
give
me
that
he
had
no
need
for
further
questions
here
was
a
proof
more
eloquent
than
words
to
his
ready
wit
sir
rowland
or
richard
or
both
were
in
some
plot
for
the
duke
ruin
perhaps
assassination
had
not
her
very
words
shown
that
she
herself
was
out
of
all
sympathy
with
monmouth
he
was
out
of
sympathy
himself
but
not
to
the
extent
of
standing
by
to
see
his
throat
cut
she
would
have
the
plot
succeed
whatever
it
might
be
and
yet
that
he
himself
be
spared
there
his
thoughts
paused
but
only
for
a
moment
he
saw
suddenly
in
this
not
a
proof
of
concern
born
of
love
but
of
duty
towards
him
who
had
imperilled
himself
once
and
for
all
time
indeed
that
he
might
save
her
brother
and
sir
rowland
he
told
her
what
had
been
so
suddenly
revealed
to
him
taxing
her
with
it
she
acknowledged
it
her
wits
battling
to
find
some
way
by
which
she
might
yet
gain
a
few
moments
more
she
would
cling
to
the
key
and
though
he
should
offer
her
violence
she
would
not
let
it
go
without
a
struggle
and
that
struggle
must
consume
the
little
time
yet
wanting
to
make
it
too
late
for
him
to
save
the
duke
and
what
imported
more
thus
save
herself
from
betraying
her
brother
trust
another
fear
leapt
at
her
suddenly
if
through
deed
of
hers
monmouth
was
spared
that
night
blake
in
his
despair
and
rage
might
slake
his
vengeance
upon
richard
give
me
that
key
he
demanded
his
voice
cold
and
quiet
his
face
set
no
no
she
cried
setting
her
hand
behind
her
you
shall
not
go
anthony
you
shall
not
i
must
he
insisted
still
cold
but
oh
so
determined
my
in
it
now
that
i
you
go
to
your
death
she
reminded
him
he
sneered
what
signifies
a
day
or
so
give
me
the
i
love
you
anthony
she
cried
livid
to
the
lips
lies
he
answered
her
contemptuously
the
key
no
she
answered
and
her
firmness
matched
his
own
i
will
not
have
you
is
not
my
purpose
not
just
yet
but
i
must
save
the
others
god
forgive
me
if
i
offer
violence
to
a
woman
he
added
and
lay
rude
hands
upon
her
do
not
compel
me
to
he
advanced
upon
her
but
she
lithe
and
quick
evaded
him
and
sprang
for
the
middle
of
the
room
he
wheeled
about
his
all
slipping
from
him
now
suddenly
she
darted
to
the
window
and
with
the
hand
that
clenched
the
key
she
smote
a
pane
with
all
her
might
there
was
a
smash
of
shivering
glass
followed
an
instant
later
by
a
faint
tinkle
on
the
stones
below
and
the
hand
that
she
still
held
out
covered
itself
all
with
blood
o
god
he
cried
the
key
and
all
else
forgotten
you
are
but
you
are
saved
she
cried
overwrought
and
staggered
laughing
and
sobbing
to
a
chair
sinking
her
bleeding
hand
to
her
lap
and
smearing
recklessly
her
spotless
shimmering
gown
he
caught
up
a
chair
by
its
legs
and
at
a
single
blow
smashed
down
the
door
a
frail
barrier
after
all
nick
he
roared
nick
he
tossed
the
chair
from
him
and
vanished
into
the
adjoining
room
to
reappear
a
moment
later
carrying
basin
and
ewer
and
a
shirt
of
trenchard
the
first
piece
of
linen
he
could
find
she
was
half
fainting
and
she
let
him
have
his
swift
masterful
way
he
bathed
her
hand
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
the
injury
was
none
so
great
as
the
flow
of
blood
had
made
him
fear
he
tore
fine
cambric
shirt
to
shreds
a
matter
on
which
trenchard
afterwards
commented
in
quotations
from
at
least
three
famous
elizabethan
dramatists
he
bound
up
her
hand
just
as
nick
made
his
appearance
at
the
splintered
door
his
mouth
open
his
pipe
gone
out
between
his
fingers
he
was
followed
by
a
startled
the
only
other
person
in
the
house
for
every
one
was
out
of
doors
that
night
into
the
woman
care
wilding
delivered
his
wife
and
without
a
word
to
her
he
left
the
room
dragging
trenchard
with
him
it
was
striking
nine
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
and
the
sound
brought
as
much
satisfaction
to
ruth
above
as
dismay
to
wilding
below
chapter
xix
the
banquet
it
was
striking
nine
therefore
ruth
thought
that
she
had
achieved
her
object
wilding
imagined
that
all
was
lost
it
needed
the
more
tranquil
mind
of
nicholas
trenchard
to
show
him
the
fly
in
madam
ointment
after
wilding
in
half
a
dozen
words
had
made
him
acquainted
with
the
situation
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
trenchard
run
to
newlington
and
warn
the
duke
if
still
in
and
thereby
precipitate
the
catastrophe
oh
give
it
thought
it
is
all
it
needs
you
are
taking
it
for
granted
that
nine
is
the
hour
appointed
for
king
monmouth
what
else
asked
wilding
impatient
to
be
off
they
were
standing
in
the
street
under
the
sign
of
the
ship
by
which
jonathan
edney
trenchard
landlord
distinguished
his
premises
and
the
chandler
trade
he
drove
there
trenchard
set
a
detaining
hand
on
wilding
arm
nine
is
the
hour
appointed
for
supper
it
is
odds
the
duke
will
be
a
little
late
and
it
is
more
than
odds
that
when
he
does
arrive
the
assassins
will
wait
until
the
company
is
safely
at
table
and
lulled
by
good
eating
and
drinking
you
had
overlooked
that
i
see
it
asks
an
old
head
for
wisdom
after
all
look
you
anthony
speed
to
colonel
wade
as
fast
as
your
legs
can
carry
you
and
get
a
score
of
men
then
find
some
fellow
to
lead
you
to
newlington
orchard
and
if
only
you
do
not
arrive
too
late
you
may
take
sir
rowland
and
his
in
the
rear
and
destroy
them
to
a
man
before
they
realize
themselves
attacked
reconnoitre
while
you
go
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
front
of
the
house
away
with
you
ordinarily
wilding
was
a
man
of
a
certain
dignity
but
you
had
not
thought
it
had
you
seen
him
running
in
silk
stockings
and
shoes
at
a
headlong
pace
through
the
narrow
streets
of
bridgwater
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
he
overset
more
than
one
and
oaths
followed
him
from
these
and
from
others
whom
he
rudely
jostled
out
of
his
path
wade
was
gone
with
monmouth
but
he
came
upon
captain
slape
who
had
a
company
of
scythes
and
musketeers
incorporated
in
the
own
regiment
and
to
him
wilding
gasped
out
the
news
and
his
request
for
a
score
of
men
with
what
breath
was
left
him
time
was
lost
and
never
was
time
more
precious
in
convincing
slape
that
this
was
no
old
wife
tale
at
last
however
he
won
his
way
and
twenty
musketeers
but
the
the
hour
had
chimed
ere
they
left
the
castle
he
led
them
forth
at
a
sharp
run
with
never
a
thought
for
the
circumstance
that
they
would
need
their
breath
anon
perhaps
for
fighting
and
he
bade
the
man
who
guided
them
take
them
by
back
streets
that
they
might
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
within
a
of
the
house
he
halted
them
and
sent
one
forward
to
reconnoitre
following
himself
with
the
others
as
quietly
and
noiselessly
as
possible
newlington
house
was
all
alight
but
from
the
absence
of
uproar
sounds
there
were
in
plenty
from
the
main
street
where
a
dense
throng
had
collected
to
see
his
majesty
go
in
wilding
inferred
with
supreme
relief
that
they
were
still
in
time
but
the
danger
was
not
yet
past
already
perhaps
the
assassins
were
penetrating
or
had
penetrated
to
the
house
and
at
any
moment
such
sounds
might
greet
them
as
would
announce
the
execution
of
their
murderous
design
meanwhile
trenchard
having
relighted
his
pipe
and
set
his
hat
rakishly
atop
his
golden
wig
strolled
up
the
high
street
swinging
his
long
cane
very
much
like
a
gentleman
taking
the
air
in
quest
of
an
appetite
for
supper
he
strolled
past
the
cross
and
on
until
he
came
to
the
handsome
mansion
one
of
the
few
handsome
houses
in
bridgwater
where
opulent
newlington
had
his
residence
a
small
crowd
had
congregated
about
the
doors
for
word
had
gone
forth
that
his
majesty
was
to
sup
there
trenchard
moved
slowly
through
the
people
seemingly
uninterested
but
in
fact
scanning
closely
every
face
he
encountered
suddenly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
espied
in
the
indifferent
light
richard
westmacott
trenchard
passed
him
jostling
him
as
he
went
and
strolled
on
some
few
paces
then
turned
and
came
slowly
back
and
observed
that
richard
had
also
turned
and
was
now
watching
him
as
he
approached
he
was
all
but
upon
the
boy
when
suddenly
his
wrinkled
face
lighted
with
recognition
mr
westmacott
he
cried
and
there
was
surprise
in
his
voice
richard
conscious
that
trenchard
must
no
doubt
regard
him
as
a
flushed
and
stood
aside
to
give
passage
to
the
other
but
trenchard
was
by
no
means
minded
to
pass
he
clapped
a
hand
on
richard
shoulder
nay
he
cried
between
laughter
and
feigned
resentment
do
you
bear
me
lad
richard
was
somewhat
taken
aback
for
what
should
i
bear
you
trenchard
quoth
he
trenchard
laughed
frankly
and
so
uproariously
that
his
hat
cocked
was
all
but
shaken
from
his
head
i
mind
me
the
last
time
we
met
i
played
you
an
unfair
trick
said
he
his
tone
bespoke
the
very
highest
he
slipped
his
arm
through
richard
never
bear
an
old
man
malice
lad
said
he
i
assure
you
that
i
bear
you
none
said
richard
relieved
to
find
that
trenchard
apparently
knew
nothing
of
his
defection
yet
wishing
that
trenchard
would
go
his
ways
for
richard
task
was
to
stand
sentry
there
i
not
believe
you
till
you
afford
me
proof
trenchard
replied
you
shall
come
and
wash
your
resentment
down
in
the
best
bottle
of
canary
the
white
cow
can
furnish
not
now
i
thank
you
answered
richard
you
are
thinking
of
the
last
occasion
on
which
i
drank
with
you
said
trenchard
reproachfully
not
so
but
but
i
am
not
not
thirsty
echoed
trenchard
and
is
that
a
reason
why
lad
it
is
the
beast
that
drinks
only
when
he
thirsts
and
in
that
lies
one
of
the
main
differences
between
beast
and
man
come
on
and
his
arm
effected
a
gentle
pressure
upon
richard
to
move
him
thence
but
at
that
moment
down
the
street
with
a
great
rumble
of
wheels
cracking
of
whips
and
clatter
of
hoofs
came
a
coach
bearing
to
newlington
king
monmouth
escorted
by
his
forty
cheering
broke
from
the
crowd
as
the
carriage
drew
up
and
the
as
he
alighted
turned
his
handsome
face
on
which
shone
the
ruddy
glow
of
torches
to
acknowledge
these
loyal
acclamations
he
passed
up
the
steps
at
the
top
of
which
newlington
fat
and
pale
and
monstrously
overdressed
stood
bowing
to
welcome
his
royal
visitor
host
and
guest
vanished
followed
by
some
six
officers
of
monmouth
among
whom
were
grey
and
wade
the
flattened
themselves
against
the
walls
as
the
great
lumbering
coach
put
about
and
went
off
again
the
way
it
had
come
the
following
after
trenchard
fancied
that
he
caught
a
sigh
of
relief
from
richard
but
the
street
was
noisy
at
the
time
and
he
may
well
have
been
mistaken
come
said
he
renewing
his
invitation
we
shall
both
be
the
better
for
a
little
milk
of
the
white
richard
wavered
almost
by
instinct
the
white
cow
he
knew
was
famous
for
its
sack
on
the
other
hand
he
was
pledged
to
sir
rowland
to
stand
guard
in
the
narrow
lane
at
the
back
where
ran
the
wall
of
newlington
garden
under
the
gentle
suasion
of
trenchard
arm
he
moved
a
few
steps
up
the
street
then
halted
his
duty
battling
with
his
inclination
no
no
he
muttered
if
you
will
excuse
me
not
i
said
trenchard
drawing
from
his
hesitation
a
shrewd
inference
as
to
richard
business
to
drink
alone
is
an
abomination
i
not
be
guilty
but
began
the
irresolute
richard
shalt
urge
me
no
excuses
or
we
quarrel
come
and
he
moved
on
dragging
richard
with
him
a
few
steps
richard
took
unwillingly
under
the
other
soft
compulsion
then
having
given
the
matter
thought
he
was
always
one
to
take
the
line
of
least
resistance
he
assured
himself
that
his
sentryship
was
entirely
superfluous
the
matter
of
blake
affair
was
an
entire
secret
shared
only
by
those
who
had
a
hand
in
it
blake
was
quite
safe
from
all
surprises
trenchard
was
insistent
and
it
was
difficult
to
deny
him
and
the
sack
at
the
white
cow
was
no
doubt
the
best
in
somerset
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
inevitable
and
fell
into
step
alongside
his
companion
who
babbled
aimlessly
of
trivial
matters
trenchard
felt
the
change
from
unwilling
to
willing
companionship
and
approved
it
they
mounted
the
three
steps
and
entered
the
common
room
of
the
inn
it
was
well
thronged
at
the
time
but
they
found
places
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
and
there
they
sat
and
discussed
the
landlady
canary
for
the
best
part
of
a
until
a
sudden
spatter
of
musketry
near
at
hand
came
to
startle
the
whole
room
there
was
a
momentary
stillness
in
the
tavern
succeeded
by
an
excited
clamouring
a
dash
for
the
windows
and
a
storm
of
questions
to
which
none
could
return
any
answer
richard
had
risen
with
a
sudden
exclamation
very
pale
and
scared
of
aspect
trenchard
tugged
at
his
sleeve
sit
down
said
he
sit
down
it
will
be
nothing
echoed
richard
and
his
eyes
were
suddenly
bent
on
trenchard
in
a
look
in
which
suspicion
was
now
blent
with
terror
a
second
volley
of
musketry
crackled
forth
at
that
moment
and
the
next
the
whole
street
was
in
an
uproar
men
were
running
and
shots
resounded
on
every
side
above
all
of
which
predominated
the
cry
that
his
majesty
was
murdered
in
an
instant
the
common
room
of
the
white
cow
was
emptied
of
every
occupant
save
two
trenchard
and
westmacott
neither
of
them
felt
the
need
to
go
forth
in
quest
of
news
they
knew
how
idle
was
the
cry
in
the
streets
they
knew
what
had
taken
place
and
knowing
it
trenchard
smoked
on
placidly
satisfied
that
wilding
had
been
in
time
whilst
richard
stood
stricken
and
petrified
by
dismay
at
realizing
with
even
greater
certainty
that
something
had
supervened
to
thwart
perhaps
to
destroy
sir
rowland
for
he
knew
that
blake
party
had
gone
forth
armed
with
pistols
only
and
intent
not
to
use
even
these
save
in
the
last
extremity
to
avoid
noise
they
were
to
keep
to
steel
this
knowledge
gave
richard
positive
assurance
that
the
volleys
they
had
heard
must
have
been
fired
by
some
party
that
had
fallen
upon
men
and
taken
them
by
surprise
and
it
was
his
fault
he
was
the
traitor
to
whom
perhaps
a
score
of
men
owed
their
deaths
at
that
moment
he
had
failed
to
keep
watch
as
he
had
undertaken
his
fault
it
was
no
not
his
but
this
villain
who
sat
there
smugly
taking
his
ease
and
pulling
at
his
pipe
at
a
blow
richard
dashed
the
thing
from
his
companion
mouth
and
fingers
trenchard
looked
up
startled
what
the
devil
he
began
it
is
your
fault
your
fault
cried
richard
his
eyes
blazing
his
lips
livid
it
was
you
who
lured
me
trenchard
stared
at
him
in
bland
surprise
now
what
a
plague
you
saying
he
asked
and
brought
richard
to
his
senses
by
awaking
in
him
the
instinct
of
how
could
he
explain
his
meaning
without
betraying
himself
and
surely
that
were
a
folly
now
that
the
others
were
no
doubt
disposed
of
let
him
rather
bethink
him
of
his
own
safety
trenchard
looked
at
him
keenly
with
intent
to
read
what
might
be
passing
in
his
mind
then
rose
paid
for
the
wine
and
expressed
his
intention
of
going
forth
to
inquire
into
these
strange
matters
that
were
happening
in
bridgwater
meanwhile
those
volleys
fired
in
newlington
orchard
had
caused
as
well
may
be
conceived
an
agitated
interruption
of
the
superb
feast
newlington
had
spread
for
his
noble
and
distinguished
guests
the
duke
had
for
some
days
been
going
in
fear
of
his
life
for
already
he
had
been
fired
at
more
than
once
by
men
anxious
to
earn
the
price
at
which
his
head
was
valued
instantly
he
surmised
that
whatever
that
firing
might
mean
it
indicated
some
attempt
to
surprise
him
with
the
few
gentlemen
who
attended
him
the
whole
company
came
instantly
to
its
feet
and
colonel
wade
stepped
to
a
window
that
stood
open
for
the
night
was
very
warm
the
duke
turned
for
explanation
to
his
host
the
trader
however
professed
himself
entirely
unable
to
offer
any
he
was
very
pale
and
his
limbs
were
visibly
trembling
but
then
his
agitation
was
most
natural
his
wife
and
daughter
supervened
at
that
moment
in
their
alarm
entering
the
room
unceremoniously
in
spite
of
the
august
presence
to
inquire
into
the
meaning
of
this
firing
and
to
reassure
themselves
that
their
father
and
his
illustrious
guests
were
safe
from
the
windows
they
could
observe
a
stir
in
the
gardens
below
black
shadows
of
men
flitted
to
and
fro
and
a
loud
rich
voice
was
heard
calling
to
them
to
take
cover
that
they
were
betrayed
then
a
sheet
of
livid
flame
blazed
along
the
summit
of
the
low
wall
and
a
second
volley
of
musketry
rang
out
succeeded
by
cries
and
screams
from
the
assailed
and
the
shouts
of
the
assailers
who
were
now
pouring
into
the
garden
through
the
battered
doorway
and
over
the
wall
for
some
moments
steel
rang
on
steel
and
cracked
here
and
there
to
the
accompaniment
of
voices
raised
some
in
anger
some
in
pain
but
it
was
soon
over
and
a
comparative
stillness
succeeded
a
voice
called
up
from
the
darkness
under
the
windows
to
know
if
his
majesty
was
safe
there
had
been
a
plot
to
take
him
but
the
ambuscaders
had
been
ambuscaded
in
their
turn
and
not
a
man
of
them
remained
which
was
hardly
exact
for
under
a
laurel
bush
scarce
daring
to
breathe
lay
sir
rowland
blake
livid
with
fear
and
fury
and
bleeding
from
a
rapier
scratch
in
the
cheek
but
otherwise
unhurt
in
the
room
above
monmouth
had
sunk
wearily
into
his
chair
upon
hearing
of
the
design
there
had
been
against
his
life
a
deep
bitter
melancholy
enwrapped
his
spirit
lord
grey
first
thoughts
flew
to
the
man
he
most
disliked
the
one
man
missing
from
those
who
had
been
bidden
to
accompany
his
majesty
whose
absence
had
already
formed
the
subject
of
comment
grey
remembered
this
bearing
before
the
council
that
same
evening
and
his
undisguised
resentment
of
the
reproaches
levelled
against
him
where
is
wilding
he
asked
suddenly
his
voice
dominating
the
din
of
talk
that
filled
the
room
do
we
hold
the
explanation
of
his
absence
monmouth
looked
up
quickly
his
beautiful
eyes
ineffably
sad
his
weak
mouth
drooping
at
the
corners
wade
turned
to
confront
grey
your
lordship
does
not
suggest
that
wilding
can
have
a
hand
in
this
appearances
would
seem
to
point
in
that
direction
answered
grey
and
in
his
wicked
heart
he
almost
hoped
it
might
be
so
then
appearances
speak
truth
for
once
came
a
bitter
ringing
voice
they
turned
and
there
on
the
threshold
stood
wilding
unheard
he
had
come
upon
them
he
was
bareheaded
and
carried
his
drawn
sword
there
was
blood
upon
it
and
there
was
blood
on
the
lace
that
half
concealed
the
hand
that
held
it
otherwise
and
saving
that
his
shoes
and
stockings
were
sodden
with
the
dew
from
the
long
grass
in
the
orchard
he
was
as
spotless
as
when
he
had
left
ruth
in
lodging
his
face
too
was
calm
save
for
the
mocking
smile
with
which
he
eyed
lord
grey
monmouth
rose
on
his
appearance
and
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
in
alarm
grey
whipped
his
own
from
the
scabbard
and
placed
himself
slightly
in
front
of
his
master
as
if
to
preserve
him
you
mistake
sirs
said
wilding
quietly
the
hand
i
have
had
in
this
affair
has
been
to
save
your
majesty
from
your
enemies
at
the
moment
i
should
have
joined
you
word
was
brought
me
of
the
plot
that
was
laid
of
the
trap
that
was
set
for
you
i
hastened
to
the
castle
and
obtained
a
score
of
musketeers
of
slape
company
with
those
i
surprised
the
murderers
lurking
in
the
garden
there
and
made
an
end
of
them
i
greatly
feared
i
should
not
come
in
time
but
it
is
plain
that
heaven
preserves
your
majesty
for
better
in
the
revulsion
of
feeling
monmouth
eyes
shone
moist
grey
sheathed
his
sword
with
an
awkward
laugh
and
a
still
more
awkward
word
of
apology
to
wilding
the
duke
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
to
make
amends
for
his
unworthy
suspicions
for
his
perhaps
unworthy
reception
of
wilding
earlier
that
evening
in
the
drew
the
sword
on
which
his
hand
still
rested
he
advanced
a
step
kneel
wilding
he
said
in
a
voice
stirred
by
emotion
but
wilding
stern
spirit
scorned
this
all
too
sudden
friendliness
of
monmouth
as
much
as
he
scorned
the
accolade
at
monmouth
hands
there
are
more
pressing
matters
to
demand
your
majesty
attention
said
wilding
coldly
advancing
to
the
table
as
he
spoke
and
taking
up
a
napkin
to
wipe
his
blade
than
the
reward
of
an
unworthy
monmouth
felt
his
sudden
enthusiasm
chilled
by
that
tone
and
manner
mr
newlington
said
wilding
after
the
briefest
of
pauses
and
the
fat
sinful
merchant
started
forward
in
alarm
it
was
like
a
summons
of
doom
his
majesty
came
hither
i
am
informed
to
receive
at
your
hands
a
sum
of
money
twenty
thousand
pounds
towards
the
expenses
of
the
campaign
have
you
the
money
at
hand
and
his
eye
glittering
between
cruelty
and
mockery
fixed
itself
upon
the
merchant
ashen
face
it
it
shall
be
forthcoming
by
morning
stammered
newlington
by
morning
cried
grey
who
with
the
others
watched
newlington
what
time
they
all
wondered
at
wilding
question
and
the
manner
of
it
you
knew
that
i
march
monmouth
reproached
the
merchant
and
it
was
to
receive
the
money
that
you
invited
his
majesty
to
do
you
the
honours
of
supping
with
you
here
put
in
wade
frowning
darkly
the
merchant
wife
and
daughter
stood
beside
him
watching
him
and
plainly
uneasy
before
he
could
make
any
reply
wilding
spoke
again
the
circumstance
that
he
has
not
the
money
by
him
is
a
little
odd
or
would
be
were
it
not
for
what
has
happened
i
would
submit
your
majesty
that
you
receive
from
newlington
not
twenty
thousand
pounds
as
he
had
promised
you
but
thirty
thousand
and
that
you
receive
it
not
as
a
loan
as
was
proposed
but
as
a
fine
imposed
upon
him
in
consequence
of
his
lack
of
care
in
the
matter
of
his
monmouth
looked
at
the
merchant
very
sternly
you
have
heard
wilding
suggestion
said
he
you
may
thank
the
god
of
traitors
it
was
made
else
we
might
have
thought
of
a
harsher
course
you
shall
pay
the
money
by
ten
to
wilding
whom
i
shall
leave
behind
for
the
sole
purpose
of
collecting
he
turned
from
newlington
in
plain
disgust
i
think
sirs
that
here
is
no
more
to
be
done
are
the
streets
safe
wilding
not
only
safe
your
majesty
but
the
twenty
men
of
slape
and
your
own
are
waiting
to
escort
then
in
god
name
let
us
be
going
said
monmouth
sheathing
his
sword
and
moving
towards
the
door
not
a
second
time
did
he
offer
to
confer
the
honour
of
knighthood
upon
his
saviour
wilding
turned
and
went
out
to
marshal
his
men
the
duke
and
his
officers
followed
more
leisurely
as
they
reached
the
door
a
cry
broke
the
silence
behind
them
monmouth
turned
newlington
purple
of
face
and
his
eyes
protruding
horridly
was
beating
the
air
with
his
hands
suddenly
he
collapsed
and
crashed
forward
with
arms
flung
out
amid
the
glass
and
silver
of
the
table
all
spread
with
the
traitor
banquet
to
which
he
had
bidden
his
unsuspecting
victim
his
wife
and
daughter
ran
to
him
and
called
him
by
name
monmouth
pausing
a
moment
to
watch
them
from
the
doorway
with
eyes
unmoved
but
newlington
answered
not
their
call
for
he
was
dead
chapter

the
reckoning
ruth
had
sped
home
through
the
streets
unattended
as
she
had
come
heedless
of
the
rude
jostlings
and
ruder
greetings
she
met
with
from
those
she
passed
heedless
too
of
the
smarting
of
her
injured
hand
for
the
agony
of
her
soul
was
such
that
it
whelmed
all
minor
sufferings
of
the
flesh
in
the
at
lupton
house
she
came
upon
diana
and
lady
horton
at
supper
and
her
appearance
her
white
and
distraught
face
and
gown
brought
both
women
to
their
feet
in
alarmed
inquiry
no
less
than
it
brought
jasper
the
butler
to
her
side
with
ready
solicitude
ruth
answered
him
that
there
was
no
cause
for
fear
that
she
was
quite
well
had
scratched
her
hand
no
more
and
with
that
dismissed
him
when
she
was
alone
with
her
aunt
and
cousin
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
told
them
what
had
passed
her
husband
and
herself
and
most
of
what
she
said
was
greek
to
lady
horton
mr
wilding
has
gone
to
warn
the
duke
she
ended
and
the
despair
of
her
tone
was
tragical
i
sought
to
detain
him
until
it
should
be
too
late
i
thought
i
had
done
so
but
but
oh
i
am
afraid
diana
afraid
of
what
asked
diana
afraid
of
what
and
she
came
to
ruth
and
set
an
arm
in
comfort
about
her
shoulders
afraid
that
wilding
might
reach
the
duke
in
time
to
be
destroyed
with
him
her
cousin
answered
such
a
warning
could
but
hasten
on
the
lady
horton
begged
to
be
enlightened
and
was
filled
with
horror
when
from
diana
enlightenment
was
hers
her
sympathies
were
all
with
the
handsome
monmouth
for
he
was
beautiful
and
should
therefore
be
triumphant
poor
lady
horton
never
got
beyond
externals
that
her
nephew
and
sir
rowland
whom
she
had
esteemed
should
be
leagued
in
this
dastardly
undertaking
against
that
lovely
person
horrified
her
beyond
words
she
withdrew
soon
afterwards
having
warmly
praised
ruth
action
in
warning
wilding
unable
to
understand
that
it
should
be
no
part
of
ruth
design
to
save
the
duke
and
went
to
her
room
to
pray
for
the
preservation
of
the
late
king
handsome
son
left
alone
with
her
cousin
ruth
gave
expression
to
the
fears
for
richard
by
which
she
was
being
tortured
diana
poured
wine
for
her
and
urged
her
to
drink
she
sought
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
but
as
moments
passed
and
grew
to
hours
and
still
richard
did
not
appear
ruth
fears
that
he
had
come
to
harm
were
changed
to
certainty
there
was
a
moment
when
but
for
diana
remonstrances
she
had
gone
forth
in
quest
of
news
bad
news
were
better
than
this
horror
of
suspense
what
if
wilding
warning
should
have
procured
help
and
richard
were
slain
in
consequence
oh
it
was
unthinkable
diana
white
of
face
listened
to
and
shared
her
fears
even
her
shallow
nature
was
stirred
by
the
tragedy
of
ruth
position
by
dread
lest
richard
should
indeed
have
met
his
end
that
night
in
these
moments
of
distress
she
forgot
her
hopes
of
triumphing
over
blake
of
punishing
him
for
his
indifference
to
herself
at
last
at
something
after
midnight
there
came
a
fevered
rapping
at
the
outer
door
both
women
started
up
and
with
arms
about
each
other
in
their
sudden
panic
stood
there
waiting
for
the
news
that
must
be
here
at
last
the
door
of
the
was
flung
open
the
women
recoiled
in
their
dread
of
what
might
come
then
richard
entered
jasper
startled
countenance
showing
behind
him
he
closed
the
door
shutting
out
the
wondering
servant
and
they
saw
that
though
his
face
was
ashen
and
his
limbs
all
he
showed
no
sign
of
any
hurt
or
effort
his
dress
was
as
meticulous
as
when
last
they
had
seen
him
ruth
flew
to
him
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pressed
him
to
her
oh
richard
richard
she
sobbed
in
the
immensity
of
her
relief
thank
god
thank
god
he
wriggled
peevishly
in
her
embrace
disengaged
her
arms
and
put
her
from
him
almost
roughly
have
done
he
growled
and
lurching
past
her
he
reached
the
table
took
up
a
bottle
and
brimmed
himself
a
measure
he
gulped
the
wine
avidly
set
down
the
cup
and
shivered
where
is
blake
he
asked
blake
echoed
ruth
her
lips
white
diana
sank
into
a
chair
watchful
fearful
and
silent
taking
now
no
glory
in
the
thing
she
had
encompassed
richard
beat
his
hands
together
in
a
passion
of
dismay
is
he
not
here
he
asked
and
groaned
o
god
he
flung
himself
all
limp
into
a
chair
you
have
heard
the
news
i
see
he
said
not
all
of
it
said
diana
hoarsely
leaning
forward
tell
us
what
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
we
were
betrayed
he
said
in
a
quivering
voice
betrayed
did
i
but
know
by
whom
he
broke
off
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
shrugged
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
shivering
till
his
shoulders
shook
blake
party
was
set
upon
by
half
a
company
of
musketeers
their
corpses
are
strewn
about
old
newlington
orchard
not
one
of
them
escaped
they
say
that
newlington
himself
is
he
poured
himself
more
wine
ruth
listened
her
eyes
burning
the
rest
of
her
as
cold
as
ice
but
but
oh
thank
god
that
you
at
least
are
safe
dick
how
did
you
escape
quoth
diana
how
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
stung
he
laughed
in
a
high
cracked
voice
his
eyes
wild
and
bloodshot
how
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
blake
has
gone
to
his
account
perhaps
he
checked
on
the
word
and
started
to
his
feet
diana
screamed
in
sheer
affright
behind
her
the
windows
had
been
thrust
open
so
violently
that
one
of
the
panes
was
shivered
blake
stood
under
the
lintel
scarce
recognizable
so
smeared
was
his
face
with
the
blood
escaping
from
the
wound
his
cheek
had
taken
his
clothes
were
muddied
soiled
torn
and
disordered
framed
there
against
the
black
background
of
the
night
he
stood
and
surveyed
them
for
a
moment
his
aspect
terrific
then
he
leapt
forward
baring
his
sword
as
he
came
an
incoherent
roar
burst
from
his
lips
as
he
bore
straight
down
upon
richard
you
damned
infernal
traitor
he
cried
draw
draw
or
die
like
the
muckworm
that
you
intrepid
her
terror
all
vanished
now
that
there
was
the
need
for
courage
ruth
confronted
him
barring
his
passage
a
buckler
to
her
palsied
brother
out
of
my
way
mistress
or
i
be
doing
you
a
you
are
mad
sir
rowland
she
told
him
in
a
voice
that
did
something
towards
restoring
him
to
his
senses
his
fierce
eyes
considered
her
a
moment
and
he
controlled
himself
to
offer
an
explanation
the
twenty
that
were
with
me
lie
stark
under
the
stars
in
newlington
garden
he
told
her
as
richard
had
told
her
already
i
escaped
by
a
miracle
no
less
but
for
what
feversham
will
demand
of
me
a
stern
account
of
those
lives
whilst
if
i
am
found
in
bridgwater
there
will
be
a
short
shrift
for
me
at
the
rebel
hands
for
my
share
in
this
affair
is
known
my
name
on
every
lip
in
the
town
and
why
he
asked
with
a
sudden
increase
of
fierceness
why
because
that
craven
villain
there
betrayed
he
did
not
she
answered
in
so
assured
a
voice
that
not
only
did
it
give
him
pause
but
caused
richard
cowering
behind
her
to
raise
his
head
in
wonder
sir
rowland
smiled
his
disbelief
and
that
smile
twisting
his
countenance
was
grotesque
and
horrible
i
left
him
to
guard
our
backs
and
give
me
warning
if
any
approached
he
informed
her
i
knew
him
for
too
great
a
coward
to
be
trusted
in
the
fight
so
i
gave
him
a
safe
task
and
yet
in
that
he
failed
me
because
he
had
betrayed
and
sold
he
had
not
i
tell
you
he
had
not
she
insisted
i
swear
he
stared
at
her
there
was
no
one
else
for
it
he
made
answer
and
bade
her
harshly
stand
aside
diana
huddled
together
watched
and
waited
in
horror
for
the
end
of
these
consequences
of
her
work
blake
made
a
sudden
movement
to
win
past
ruth
richard
staggered
to
his
feet
intent
on
defending
himself
but
he
was
swordless
retreat
to
the
door
suggested
itself
and
he
had
half
turned
to
attempt
to
gain
it
when
ruth
next
words
arrested
him
petrified
him
there
was
some
one
else
for
it
sir
rowland
she
cried
it
was
not
richard
who
betrayed
you
it
it
was
you
the
fierceness
seemed
all
to
drop
away
from
him
whelmed
in
the
immensity
of
his
astonishment
you
then
he
laughed
loud
in
scornful
disbelief
you
think
to
save
him
he
said
should
i
lie
she
asked
him
calm
and
brave
he
stared
at
her
stupidly
he
passed
a
hand
across
his
brow
and
looked
at
diana
oh
it
is
impossible
he
said
at
last
you
shall
hear
she
answered
and
told
him
how
at
the
last
moment
she
had
learnt
not
only
that
her
husband
was
in
bridgwater
but
that
he
was
to
sup
at
newlington
with
the
duke
party
i
had
no
thought
of
betraying
you
or
of
saving
the
duke
she
said
i
knew
how
justifiable
was
what
you
intended
but
i
could
not
let
wilding
go
to
his
death
i
sought
to
detain
him
warning
him
only
when
i
thought
it
would
be
too
late
for
him
to
warn
others
but
you
delayed
overlong
and
a
hoarse
inarticulate
cry
from
him
came
to
interrupt
her
at
that
point
one
glimpse
of
his
face
she
had
and
of
the
hand
half
raised
with
sword
pointing
towards
her
and
she
closed
her
eyes
thinking
that
her
sands
were
run
and
indeed
blake
intention
was
just
then
to
kill
her
that
he
should
owe
his
betrayal
to
her
was
in
itself
cause
enough
to
enrage
him
but
that
her
motive
should
have
been
her
desire
to
save
wilding
wilding
of
all
men
that
was
the
last
straw
had
he
been
forewarned
that
wilding
was
to
be
one
of
monmouth
party
at
newlington
his
pulses
would
have
throbbed
with
joy
and
he
would
have
flung
himself
into
his
murderous
task
with
twice
the
zest
he
had
carried
to
it
and
now
he
learnt
that
not
only
had
she
thwarted
his
schemes
against
monmouth
but
had
deprived
him
of
the
ardently
sought
felicity
of
widowing
her
he
drew
back
his
arm
for
the
thrust
diana
huddled
into
her
chair
too
to
speak
or
move
richard
immediately
behind
his
sister
saw
nothing
of
what
was
passing
and
thought
of
nothing
but
his
own
safety
then
blake
paused
stepped
back
returned
his
sword
to
its
scabbard
and
bending
himself
but
whether
to
bow
or
not
was
not
quite
plain
he
took
some
paces
backwards
then
turned
and
went
out
by
the
window
as
he
had
come
but
there
was
a
sudden
purposefulness
in
the
way
he
did
it
that
might
have
warned
them
this
withdrawal
was
not
quite
the
retreat
it
seemed
they
watched
him
with
many
emotions
predominant
among
which
was
relief
and
when
he
was
gone
diana
rose
and
came
to
ruth
come
she
said
and
sought
to
lead
her
from
the
room
but
there
was
richard
now
to
be
reckoned
with
richard
from
whom
the
palsy
was
of
a
sudden
fallen
now
that
the
cause
of
it
had
withdrawn
he
had
his
back
to
the
door
and
his
weak
mouth
was
pursed
up
into
a
semblance
of
resolution
his
pale
eyes
looked
stern
his
white
eyebrows
bent
together
in
a
frown
wait
he
said
they
looked
at
him
and
the
shadow
of
a
smile
almost
flitted
across
diana
face
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
opening
it
held
it
wide
go
diana
he
said
ruth
and
i
must
understand
each
diana
hesitated
you
had
better
go
diana
said
her
cousin
whereupon
mistress
horton
went
hot
and
fierce
came
the
recriminations
from
richard
lips
when
he
and
his
sister
were
alone
and
ruth
weathered
the
storm
bravely
until
it
was
stemmed
again
by
fresh
fear
in
richard
for
blake
had
suddenly
reappeared
he
came
forward
from
his
window
his
manner
composed
and
full
of
resolution
young
westmacott
recoiled
the
heat
all
frozen
out
of
him
but
blake
scarce
looked
at
him
his
smouldering
glance
was
all
for
ruth
who
watched
him
with
incipient
fear
despite
herself
madam
he
said
is
not
to
be
supposed
a
mind
holding
so
much
thought
for
a
husband
safety
could
find
room
for
any
concern
as
to
another
i
will
ask
you
natheless
to
consider
what
tale
i
am
to
bear
lord
what
tale
said
she
aye
that
will
account
for
what
has
chanced
for
my
failure
to
discharge
the
task
entrusted
me
and
for
the
slaughter
of
an
officer
of
his
and
twenty
men
why
ask
me
this
she
demanded
half
angrily
then
suddenly
bethinking
her
of
how
she
had
ruined
his
enterprise
and
of
the
position
in
which
she
had
placed
him
she
softened
her
clear
mind
held
justice
very
dear
she
approached
oh
i
am
sorry
sorry
sir
rowland
she
cried
he
sneered
he
had
wiped
some
of
the
blood
from
his
face
but
still
looked
terrible
enough
sorry
said
he
and
laughed
unpleasantly
you
come
with
me
to
feversham
and
tell
him
what
you
did
said
he
i
she
recoiled
in
fear
at
once
he
informed
her
wha
what
that
faltered
richard
calling
up
his
manhood
and
coming
forward
what
are
you
saying
blake
sir
rowland
disdained
to
heed
him
come
mistress
he
said
and
putting
forward
his
hand
he
caught
her
wrist
and
pulled
her
roughly
towards
him
she
struggled
to
free
herself
but
he
leered
evilly
upon
her
no
whit
discomposed
by
her
endeavours
though
short
of
stature
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
bodily
strength
and
she
though
tall
was
slight
of
frame
he
released
her
wrist
and
before
she
realized
what
he
was
about
he
had
stooped
passed
an
arm
behind
her
knees
another
round
her
waist
and
swinging
her
from
her
feet
took
her
up
bodily
in
his
arms
he
turned
about
and
a
scream
broke
from
her
hold
cried
richard
hold
you
madman
keep
off
or
i
make
an
end
of
you
before
i
go
roared
blake
over
his
shoulder
for
already
he
had
turned
about
and
was
making
for
the
window
apparently
no
more
hindered
by
his
burden
than
had
she
been
a
doll
richard
sprang
to
the
door
jasper
he
bawled
jasper
he
had
no
weapons
as
we
have
seen
else
it
may
be
that
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
use
them
ruth
got
a
hand
free
and
caught
at
the
windowframe
as
blake
was
leaping
through
it
checked
their
progress
but
did
not
sensibly
delay
it
it
was
unfortunately
her
wounded
hand
with
which
she
had
sought
to
cling
and
with
an
angry
brutal
wrench
sir
rowland
compelled
her
to
unclose
her
grasp
he
sped
down
the
lawn
towards
the
orchard
where
his
horse
was
tethered
and
now
she
knew
in
a
subconscious
sort
of
way
why
he
had
earlier
withdrawn
he
had
gone
to
saddle
for
this
purpose
she
struggled
now
thinking
that
he
would
be
too
hampered
to
compel
her
to
his
will
he
became
angry
and
set
her
down
beside
his
horse
one
arm
still
holding
her
look
you
mistress
he
told
her
fiercely
living
or
dead
you
come
with
me
to
feversham
choose
his
tone
was
such
that
she
never
doubted
he
would
carry
out
his
threat
and
so
in
dull
despair
she
submitted
hoping
that
feversham
might
be
a
gentleman
and
would
recognize
and
respect
a
lady
half
fainting
she
allowed
him
to
swing
her
to
the
withers
of
his
horse
thus
they
threaded
their
way
in
the
dim
starlit
night
through
the
trees
towards
the
gate
it
stood
open
and
they
passed
out
into
the
lane
there
sir
rowland
put
his
horse
to
the
trot
which
he
increased
to
a
gallop
when
he
was
over
the
bridge
and
clear
of
the
town
chapter
xxi
the
sentence
wilding
as
we
know
was
to
remain
at
bridgwater
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
from
newlington
the
fine
which
had
been
imposed
upon
him
it
is
by
no
means
clear
whether
monmouth
realized
the
fullness
of
the
tragedy
at
the
merchant
house
and
whether
he
understood
that
stricken
with
apoplexy
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
so
considerable
a
portion
of
his
fortune
newlington
had
not
merely
fainted
but
had
expired
under
his
grace
eyes
if
he
did
realize
it
he
was
cynically
indifferent
and
lest
we
should
be
doing
him
an
injustice
by
assuming
this
we
had
better
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
take
it
that
in
the
subsequent
bustle
of
departure
his
mind
filled
with
the
prospect
of
the
night
attack
to
be
delivered
upon
his
uncle
army
he
thought
no
more
either
of
newlington
or
of
wilding
the
latter
as
we
know
had
no
place
in
the
rebel
army
although
a
man
of
his
hands
he
was
not
a
trained
soldier
and
notwithstanding
that
he
may
fully
have
intended
to
draw
his
sword
for
monmouth
when
the
time
came
yet
circumstances
had
led
to
his
continuing
after
monmouth
landing
the
more
diplomatic
work
of
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
for
the
months
that
had
preceded
it
so
it
befell
that
when
monmouth
army
marched
out
of
bridgwater
at
eleven
on
that
sunday
night
not
to
make
for
gloucester
and
cheshire
as
was
generally
believed
but
to
fall
upon
the
encamped
feversham
at
sedgemoor
and
slaughter
the
royal
army
in
their
beds
wilding
was
left
behind
trenchard
was
gone
in
command
of
his
troop
of
horse
and
wilding
had
for
only
company
his
thoughts
touching
the
singular
happenings
of
that
busy
night
he
went
back
to
the
sign
of
the
ship
overlooking
the
cross
and
kicking
off
his
sodden
shoes
he
supped
quietly
in
the
room
of
which
shattered
door
and
broken
window
reminded
him
of
his
odd
interview
with
ruth
and
of
the
comedy
of
love
she
had
enacted
to
detain
him
there
the
thought
of
it
embittered
him
the
part
she
had
played
seemed
to
his
retrospective
mind
almost
a
wanton
part
for
all
that
in
name
she
was
his
wife
and
yet
underlying
a
certain
irrepressible
nausea
came
the
reflection
that
after
all
her
purpose
had
been
to
save
his
life
it
would
have
been
a
sweet
thought
sweet
enough
to
have
overlaid
that
other
bitterness
had
he
not
insisted
upon
setting
it
down
entirely
to
her
gratitude
and
her
sense
of
justice
she
intended
to
repay
the
debt
in
which
she
had
stood
to
him
since
at
the
risk
of
his
own
life
and
fortune
he
had
rescued
her
brother
from
the
clutches
of
the
at
taunton
he
sighed
heavily
as
he
thought
of
the
results
that
had
attended
his
compulsory
wedding
of
her
in
the
intensity
of
his
passion
in
the
blindness
of
his
vanity
which
made
him
confident
gloriously
confident
that
did
he
make
himself
her
husband
she
herself
would
make
of
him
her
lover
before
long
he
had
committed
an
unworthiness
of
which
it
seemed
he
might
never
cleanse
himself
in
life
there
was
but
one
amend
as
he
had
told
her
let
him
make
it
and
perhaps
she
would
out
of
gratitude
if
out
of
no
other
feeling
come
to
think
more
kindly
of
him
and
that
night
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
sat
alone
in
that
mean
chamber
that
it
were
a
better
and
a
sweeter
thing
to
earn
some
measure
of
her
esteem
by
death
than
to
continue
in
a
life
that
inspired
her
hatred
and
resentment
from
which
it
will
be
seen
how
utterly
he
disbelieved
the
protestations
she
had
uttered
in
seeking
to
detain
him
they
were
he
was
assured
a
part
of
a
scheme
a
trick
to
lull
him
while
monmouth
and
his
officers
were
being
butchered
and
she
had
gone
the
length
of
saying
she
loved
him
he
regretted
that
being
as
he
was
convinced
of
its
untruth
what
cause
had
she
to
love
him
she
hated
him
and
because
she
hated
him
she
did
not
scruple
to
lie
to
him
once
with
suggestions
and
this
time
with
actual
expression
of
affection
that
she
might
gain
her
ends
ends
that
concerned
her
brother
and
sir
rowland
blake
sir
rowland
blake
the
name
was
a
very
goad
to
his
passion
and
despair
he
rose
from
the
table
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
moving
noiselessly
in
his
stockinged
feet
he
felt
the
need
of
air
and
action
the
weariness
of
his
flesh
incurred
in
his
long
ride
from
london
was
cast
off
or
forgotten
he
must
go
forth
he
picked
up
his
fine
shoes
of
spanish
leather
but
as
luck
would
have
it
little
though
he
guessed
the
extent
just
then
he
found
them
hardening
though
still
damp
from
the
dews
of
newlington
garden
he
cast
them
aside
and
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
unlocked
an
oak
cupboard
and
withdrew
the
heavy
muddy
boots
in
which
he
had
ridden
from
town
he
drew
them
on
and
taking
up
his
hat
and
sword
went
down
the
creaking
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
bridgwater
had
fallen
quiet
by
now
the
army
was
gone
and
townsfolk
were
in
their
beds
moodily
unconsciously
yet
as
if
guided
by
a
sort
of
instinct
he
went
down
the
high
street
and
then
turned
off
into
the
narrower
lane
that
led
in
the
direction
of
lupton
house
by
the
gates
of
this
he
paused
recalled
out
of
his
abstraction
and
rendered
aware
of
whither
his
steps
had
led
him
by
the
sight
of
the
hall
door
standing
open
a
black
figure
silhouetted
against
the
light
behind
it
what
was
happening
here
why
were
they
not
abed
like
all
decent
folk
the
figure
called
to
him
in
a
quavering
voice
mr
wilding
wilding
for
the
light
beating
upon
his
face
and
figure
from
the
open
door
had
revealed
him
the
form
came
swiftly
forward
its
steps
pattering
down
the
walk
another
slenderer
figure
surged
in
its
place
upon
the
threshold
hovered
there
an
instant
then
plunged
down
into
the
darkness
to
come
after
it
but
the
first
was
by
now
upon
wilding
what
is
it
jasper
he
asked
recognizing
the
old
servant
mistress
ruth
wailed
the
fellow
wringing
his
hands
she
she
has
been
carried
he
got
it
out
in
gasps
winded
by
his
short
run
and
by
the
excitement
that
possessed
him
no
word
said
wilding
he
just
stood
and
stared
scarcely
understanding
and
in
that
moment
they
were
joined
by
richard
he
seized
wilding
by
the
arm
blake
has
carried
her
off
he
cried
blake
said
wilding
and
wondered
with
a
sensation
of
nausea
was
it
an
ordinary
running
away
but
richard
next
words
made
it
plain
to
him
that
it
was
no
amorous
elopement
nor
even
amorous
abduction
he
has
carried
her
to
feversham
for
her
betrayal
of
his
plan
to
seize
the
that
stirred
wilding
he
wasted
no
time
in
idle
questions
or
idler
complainings
how
long
since
he
asked
and
it
was
he
who
clutched
richard
now
by
the
shoulder
and
with
a
hand
that
hurt
not
ten
minutes
ago
was
the
quavering
answer
and
you
were
at
hand
when
it
befell
cried
wilding
the
scorn
in
his
voice
rising
superior
to
his
agitation
and
fears
for
ruth
you
were
at
hand
and
could
neither
prevent
nor
follow
him
i
go
with
you
now
if
you
give
chase
whimpered
richard
feeling
himself
for
once
the
craven
that
he
was
if
echoed
wilding
scornfully
and
dragged
him
past
the
gate
and
up
towards
the
house
even
as
he
spoke
is
there
room
for
a
doubt
of
it
have
you
horses
at
least
to
spare
said
richard
as
they
hurried
on
they
skirted
the
house
and
found
the
stable
door
open
as
blake
had
left
it
old
jasper
followed
with
a
lamp
which
burned
steadily
so
calm
was
the
air
of
that
july
night
in
three
minutes
they
had
saddled
a
couple
of
nags
in
five
they
were
riding
for
the
bridge
and
the
road
to
weston
zoyland
it
is
a
miracle
you
remained
in
bridgwater
said
richard
as
they
rode
how
came
you
to
be
left
behind
i
had
a
task
assigned
me
in
the
town
against
the
duke
return
wilding
explained
and
he
spoke
almost
mechanically
his
mind
full
of
anguished
by
thoughts
of
ruth
against
the
duke
return
cried
richard
first
surprised
and
then
thinking
that
wilding
spoke
at
random
against
the
duke
return
he
repeated
that
is
what
i
said
but
the
duke
is
marching
to
the
duke
is
marching
by
circuitous
ways
to
sedgemoor
answered
wilding
never
dreaming
that
at
this
time
of
day
there
could
be
the
slightest
imprudence
in
saying
so
much
indeed
taking
little
heed
of
what
he
said
his
mind
obsessed
by
the
other
to
him
far
weightier
matter
to
sedgemoor
gasped
westmacott
aye
to
take
feversham
by
surprise
to
destroy
king
james
soldiers
in
their
beds
he
should
be
near
upon
the
attack
by
now
but
there
spur
on
and
save
your
breath
if
we
are
to
overtake
sir
they
pounded
on
through
the
night
at
a
breakneck
pace
which
they
never
slackened
until
when
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
of
penzoy
pound
where
the
army
was
encamped
and
slumbering
by
now
they
caught
sight
of
the
musketeers
matches
glowing
in
the
dark
ahead
of
them
an
outpost
barred
their
progress
but
richard
had
the
watchword
and
he
spurred
ahead
shouting
albemarle
and
the
soldiers
fell
back
and
gave
them
passage
on
they
galloped
skirting
penzoy
pound
and
the
army
sleeping
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
the
fate
that
was
creeping
stealthily
upon
it
out
of
the
darkness
and
mists
across
the
moors
they
clattered
on
past
langmoor
stone
and
dashed
straight
into
the
village
richard
never
drawing
rein
until
he
reached
the
door
of
the
cottage
where
feversham
was
lodged
they
had
come
not
only
at
a
headlong
pace
but
in
a
headlong
manner
without
quite
considering
what
awaited
them
at
the
end
of
their
ride
in
addition
to
their
object
of
finding
ruth
it
was
only
now
as
he
drew
rein
before
the
lighted
house
and
caught
the
sound
of
blake
raised
voice
pouring
through
an
open
window
on
the
ground
floor
that
richard
fully
realized
what
manner
of
rashness
he
was
committing
he
was
too
late
to
rescue
ruth
from
blake
what
more
could
he
look
to
achieve
his
hope
had
been
that
with
wilding
help
he
might
snatch
her
from
sir
rowland
before
the
latter
reached
his
destination
but
now
to
enter
feversham
presence
and
in
association
with
so
notorious
a
rebel
as
wilding
were
a
piece
of
folly
of
the
heroic
kind
that
richard
did
not
savour
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
wilding
masterful
presence
it
is
more
than
odds
he
had
turned
tail
and
ridden
home
again
to
bed
but
wilding
who
had
leapt
nimbly
to
the
ground
stood
waiting
for
richard
to
dismount
impatient
now
that
from
the
sound
of
sir
voice
he
had
assurance
that
richard
had
proved
an
able
guide
the
young
man
got
down
but
might
yet
have
hesitated
had
not
wilding
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
whirled
him
up
the
steps
through
the
open
door
past
the
two
soldiers
who
kept
it
and
who
were
too
surprised
to
stay
him
straight
into
the
long
chamber
where
feversham
attended
by
a
captain
of
horse
was
listening
to
blake
angry
narrative
of
that
night
failure
wilding
entrance
was
decidedly
sensational
he
stepped
quickly
forward
and
taking
blake
who
was
still
talking
all
unconscious
of
those
behind
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
interrupted
him
in
the
middle
of
an
impassioned
period
wrenched
him
backwards
off
his
feet
and
dashed
him
with
a
force
almost
incredible
into
a
heap
in
a
corner
of
the
room
there
for
some
moments
the
baronet
lay
half
dazed
by
the
shock
of
his
fall
a
long
table
which
seemed
to
divide
the
chamber
in
two
stood
between
lord
feversham
and
his
officer
and
wilding
and
ruth
by
whose
side
he
had
now
come
to
stand
in
blake
room
there
was
an
exclamation
half
anger
half
amazement
at
outrage
upon
sir
rowland
and
the
captain
of
horse
sprang
forward
but
wilding
raised
his
hand
his
face
so
composed
and
calm
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
him
conceiving
any
violence
as
indeed
he
protested
at
that
moment
be
assured
gentlemen
he
said
that
i
have
no
further
rudeness
to
offer
any
so
that
this
lady
is
suffered
to
withdraw
with
and
he
took
in
his
own
a
hand
that
ruth
amazed
and
unresisting
yielded
up
to
him
that
touch
of
his
seemed
to
drive
out
her
fears
and
to
restore
her
confidence
the
mortal
terror
in
which
she
had
been
until
his
coming
dropped
from
her
now
she
was
no
longer
alone
and
abandoned
to
the
vindictiveness
of
rude
and
violent
men
she
had
beside
her
one
in
whom
experience
had
taught
her
to
have
faith
louis
duras
marquis
de
blanquefort
and
earl
of
feversham
coughed
with
mock
discreetness
under
cover
of
his
hand
ahem
he
was
a
comely
man
with
a
long
nose
good
eyes
a
humorous
mouth
and
a
weak
chin
at
a
glance
he
looked
what
he
was
a
weak
sensualist
he
was
resplendent
at
the
moment
in
a
blue
satin
stiff
with
gold
lace
for
he
had
been
interrupted
by
blake
arrival
in
the
very
act
of
putting
himself
to
bed
and
his
head
divested
of
his
wig
was
bound
up
in
a
scarf
of
many
colours
at
his
side
the
captain
arrested
by
the
general
sardonic
cough
stood
a
freckled
boy
looking
to
his
superior
for
orders
i
you
sare
rowland
said
feversham
composedly
in
his
bad
english
who
are
you
sare
this
lady
husband
answered
wilding
whereupon
the
captain
stared
and
feversham
brows
went
up
in
surprised
amusement
true
quoth
the
latter
in
a
tone
suggesting
that
it
explained
everything
to
him
gif
a
differen
colour
to
your
story
sare
then
he
added
in
a
chuckle
ho
ho
and
laughed
outright
blake
gathering
together
his
wits
and
his
limbs
at
the
same
time
made
shift
to
rise
what
a
plague
does
their
relationship
matter
he
began
he
would
have
added
more
but
the
frenchman
thought
this
question
one
that
needed
answering
parbleu
he
swore
his
amusement
rising
it
seem
to
matter
damn
me
swore
blake
red
in
the
face
from
pale
that
he
had
been
do
you
conceive
that
if
i
had
run
away
with
his
wife
for
her
own
sake
i
had
fetched
her
to
you
he
lurched
forward
as
he
spoke
but
kept
his
distance
from
wilding
who
stood
between
ruth
and
him
feversham
bowed
sardonically
you
are
a
such
flatterer
sare
rowlan
said
he
laughter
bubbling
in
his
words
blake
looked
his
scorn
of
this
trivial
frenchman
who
upon
scenting
what
appeared
to
be
the
comedy
of
an
outraged
husband
overtaking
the
man
who
had
carried
off
his
wife
forgot
the
serious
business
a
part
of
which
sir
rowland
had
already
imparted
to
him
captain
wentworth
a
gentleman
smiled
with
this
french
general
of
a
british
army
that
he
might
win
the
great
man
favour
i
have
told
your
lordship
said
blake
froth
on
his
lips
that
the
twenty
men
i
had
from
you
as
well
as
ensign
norris
are
dead
in
bridgwater
and
that
my
plan
to
carry
off
king
monmouth
has
come
to
ruin
all
because
we
were
betrayed
by
this
woman
it
is
now
my
further
privilege
to
point
out
to
your
lordship
the
man
to
whom
she
sold
feversham
misliked
sir
rowland
arrogant
tone
misliked
his
angry
scornful
glance
his
eyes
narrowed
the
laughter
faded
slowly
from
his
face
yes
yes
i
remember
said
he
lady
you
have
tole
us
betray
you
ver
well
but
you
have
not
tole
us
who
betray
you
to
and
he
looked
inquiringly
at
blake
the
baronet
jaw
dropped
his
face
lost
some
of
its
high
colour
he
was
stunned
by
the
question
as
the
bird
is
stunned
that
flies
headlong
against
a
pane
of
glass
he
had
crashed
into
an
obstruction
so
transparent
that
he
had
not
seen
it
so
said
feversham
and
he
stroked
the
cleft
of
his
chin
captain
wentwort
be
so
kind
as
to
call
wentworth
moved
to
obey
but
before
he
had
gone
round
the
table
blake
had
looked
behind
him
and
espied
richard
shrinking
by
the
door
by
heaven
he
cried
i
can
more
than
answer
your
wentworth
stopped
looking
at
feversham
voyons
said
the
general
i
can
place
you
in
possession
of
the
man
who
has
wrought
our
ruin
he
is
there
and
he
pointed
theatrically
to
richard
feversham
looked
at
the
limp
figure
in
some
bewilderment
indeed
he
was
having
a
most
bewildering
evening
or
morning
rather
for
it
was
even
then
on
the
stroke
of
one
an
who
are
you
sare
he
asked
richard
came
forward
nerving
himself
for
what
was
to
follow
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
that
he
held
a
card
which
should
trump
any
trick
of
sir
rowland
vindictiveness
and
the
prospect
heartened
and
comforted
him
i
am
this
lady
brother
my
lord
he
answered
and
his
voice
was
fairly
steady
tiens
said
feversham
and
smiling
he
turned
to
wentworth
quite
a
family
party
sir
said
the
captain
smiling
back
oh
mais
tout
fait
said
the
general
laughing
outright
and
then
wilding
created
a
diversion
by
leading
ruth
to
a
chair
that
stood
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
and
drawing
it
forward
for
her
ah
yes
said
feversham
airily
let
madame
you
are
very
good
sir
said
ruth
her
voice
brave
and
calm
but
somewhat
lacking
in
spontaneity
wilding
criticized
which
set
wentworth
staring
and
the
frenchman
scowling
shall
i
call
the
guard
my
lord
asked
wentworth
crisply
i
yes
said
feversham
and
the
captain
gained
the
door
and
spoke
a
word
to
one
of
the
soldiers
without
but
my
lord
exclaimed
blake
in
a
tone
of
protest
i
vow
you
are
too
ready
to
take
this
fellow
he
spoke
so
few
said
feversham
do
you
know
who
he
is
you
say
lady
aye
but
his
name
cried
blake
quivering
with
anger
do
you
know
that
it
is
wilding
the
name
certainly
made
an
impression
that
might
have
flattered
the
man
to
whom
it
belonged
feversham
whole
manner
changed
the
trivial
air
of
persiflage
that
he
had
adopted
hitherto
was
gone
on
the
instant
and
his
brow
grew
dark
true
he
asked
sharply
are
you
mistaire
wildin
mistaire
antoine
wildin
your
lordship
most
devoted
servant
said
wilding
suavely
and
made
a
leg
wentworth
in
the
background
paused
in
the
act
of
reclosing
the
door
to
stare
at
this
gentleman
whose
name
albemarle
had
rendered
so
excellently
well
known
and
you
to
dare
come
thundered
feversham
thoroughly
roused
by
the
other
airy
indifference
you
to
dare
come
into
my
presence
wilding
smiled
conciliatingly
i
came
for
my
wife
my
lord
he
reminded
him
it
grieves
me
to
intrude
upon
your
lordship
at
so
late
an
hour
and
indeed
it
was
far
from
my
intent
i
had
hoped
to
overtake
sir
rowland
before
he
reached
nom
de
dieu
swore
feversham
ho
a
so
great
effrontery
he
swung
round
upon
blake
again
sare
rowlan
he
bade
him
angrily
be
so
kind
to
tell
me
what
in
breechwater
blake
his
face
purple
seemed
to
struggle
for
breath
and
words
wilding
answered
for
him
sir
rowland
is
so
choleric
my
lord
he
said
in
his
pleasant
level
voice
that
perhaps
the
tale
would
come
more
intelligibly
from
me
believe
me
that
he
has
served
you
to
the
best
of
his
ability
unfortunately
for
the
success
of
your
choice
plan
of
murder
i
had
news
of
it
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
with
a
party
of
musketeers
i
was
able
to
surprise
and
destroy
your
in
newlington
garden
you
see
my
lord
i
was
to
have
been
one
of
the
victims
myself
and
i
resented
the
attentions
that
were
intended
me
i
had
no
knowledge
that
sir
rowland
had
contrived
to
escape
and
frankly
it
is
a
thing
i
deplore
more
than
i
can
say
for
had
that
not
happened
much
trouble
might
have
been
saved
and
your
lordship
rest
had
not
been
but
woman
cried
feversham
impatiently
how
is
she
come
into
this
galare
it
was
she
who
warned
him
blake
got
out
as
already
i
have
had
the
honour
to
inform
your
and
your
lordship
can
not
blame
her
for
that
said
wilding
the
lady
is
a
most
loyal
subject
of
king
james
but
she
is
also
as
you
observe
a
dutiful
wife
i
will
add
that
it
was
her
intention
to
warn
me
only
when
too
late
for
interference
sir
rowland
as
it
happened
was
slow
in
silence
blazed
the
frenchman
now
i
know
who
you
are
make
a
so
great
difference
where
is
guard
wentwort
i
hear
them
answered
the
captain
and
from
the
street
came
the
tramp
of
their
marching
feet
feversham
turned
again
to
blake
affaire
so
he
said
between
question
and
assertion
summing
up
the
situation
as
he
understood
it
rogue
and
he
pointed
to
richard
betray
your
plan
to
sister
who
betray
it
to
who
save
duc
de
monmoot
pas
that
is
so
said
blake
and
ruth
scarcely
thought
it
worth
while
to
add
that
she
had
heard
of
the
plot
not
only
from
her
brother
but
from
blake
as
well
after
all
blake
attitude
in
the
matter
his
action
in
bringing
her
to
feversham
for
punishment
and
to
exculpate
himself
must
suffice
to
cause
any
such
statement
of
hers
to
be
lightly
received
by
the
general
she
sat
in
an
anguished
silence
her
eyes
wide
her
face
pale
and
waited
for
the
end
of
this
strange
business
in
her
heart
she
did
permit
herself
to
think
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
assemble
a
group
of
men
less
worthy
of
respect
choleric
and
vindictive
blake
foolish
feversham
stupid
wentworth
and
timid
richard
even
richard
did
not
escape
the
unfavourable
criticism
they
were
undergoing
in
her
subconscious
mind
only
wilding
detached
in
that
assembly
as
he
had
detached
in
another
that
she
remembered
and
stood
out
in
sharp
relief
a
very
man
calm
intrepid
and
if
she
was
afraid
she
was
more
afraid
for
him
than
for
herself
this
was
something
that
perhaps
she
scarcely
realized
just
then
but
she
was
to
realize
it
soon
feversham
was
speaking
again
asking
blake
a
fresh
question
and
who
betray
you
to
rogue
to
westmacott
cried
blake
he
was
in
the
plot
with
me
he
was
left
to
guard
the
rear
to
see
that
we
were
not
taken
by
surprise
and
he
deserted
his
post
had
he
not
done
that
there
had
been
no
disaster
in
spite
of
wilding
feversham
brow
was
dark
his
eyes
glittered
as
they
rested
on
the
traitor
true
sare
he
asked
him
not
quite
put
in
wilding
mr
westmacott
i
think
was
constrained
away
he
did
not
intend
blazed
feversham
did
i
interrogate
you
it
is
for
mistaire
westercott
to
he
set
a
hand
on
the
table
and
leaned
forward
towards
wilding
his
face
very
malign
you
shall
to
answer
for
yourself
mistaire
wildin
i
promise
you
you
shall
to
answer
for
he
turned
again
to
richard
eh
bien
he
snapped
will
you
speak
richard
came
forward
a
step
he
was
certainly
nervous
and
certainly
pale
but
neither
as
pale
nor
as
nervous
as
from
our
knowledge
of
richard
we
might
have
looked
to
see
him
at
that
moment
it
is
in
a
measure
true
he
said
but
what
wilding
has
said
is
more
exact
i
was
induced
away
i
did
not
dream
any
could
know
of
the
plan
or
that
my
absence
could
cause
this
so
you
went
eh
vaurien
you
be
to
do
your
duty
eh
and
it
was
you
who
tole
your
sistaire
i
may
have
told
her
but
not
before
she
had
the
tale
already
from
feversham
sneered
and
shrugged
natural
you
will
not
speak
true
a
traitor
i
observe
is
always
richard
drew
himself
up
he
seemed
invested
almost
with
a
new
dignity
your
lordship
is
pleased
to
account
me
a
traitor
he
inquired
a
dam
traitor
said
his
lordship
and
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
sergeant
with
six
men
following
him
stood
at
the
salute
upon
the
threshold
a
la
bonne
heure
his
lordship
hailed
them
sergean
you
will
arrest
rogue
and
lady
he
waved
his
hand
from
richard
to
ruth
and
you
will
take
to
the
sergeant
advanced
towards
richard
who
drew
a
step
away
from
him
ruth
rose
to
her
feet
in
agitation
wilding
interposed
himself
between
her
and
the
guard
his
hand
upon
his
sword
my
lord
he
cried
do
they
teach
no
better
courtesy
in
france
feversham
scowled
at
him
smiling
darkly
i
shall
talk
wit
you
soon
sare
said
he
his
words
a
threat
but
my
lord
began
richard
i
can
make
it
very
plain
i
am
no
traitor
in
mornin
said
feversham
blandly
waving
his
hand
and
the
sergeant
took
richard
by
the
shoulder
but
richard
twisted
from
his
grasp
in
the
morning
will
be
too
late
he
cried
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
render
you
such
a
service
as
you
little
dream
take
away
said
feversham
wearily
i
can
save
you
from
destruction
bawled
richard
you
and
your
perhaps
even
now
feversham
had
not
heeded
him
but
for
wilding
sudden
interference
silence
richard
he
cried
to
him
would
you
betray
he
checked
on
the
word
more
he
dared
not
say
but
he
hoped
faintly
that
he
had
said
enough
feversham
however
chanced
to
observe
that
this
man
who
had
shown
himself
hitherto
so
calm
looked
suddenly
most
singularly
perturbed
eh
quoth
the
general
an
instan
sergean
what
is
eh
and
he
looked
from
wilding
to
richard
your
lordship
shall
learn
at
a
price
cried
richard
me
i
not
bargain
wit
traitors
said
his
lordship
stiffly
very
well
then
answered
richard
and
he
folded
his
arms
dramatically
but
no
matter
what
your
lordship
life
may
be
hereafter
you
will
never
regret
anything
more
bitterly
than
you
shall
regret
this
by
sunrise
if
indeed
you
live
to
see
feversham
shifted
uneasily
on
his
feet
you
say
he
asked
what
you
mean
you
shall
know
at
a
price
said
richard
again
wilding
realizing
the
hopelessness
of
interfering
now
stood
gloomily
apart
a
great
bitterness
in
his
soul
at
the
indiscretion
he
had
committed
in
telling
richard
of
the
night
attack
that
was
afoot
your
lordship
shall
hear
my
price
but
you
need
not
pay
it
me
until
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
verifying
the
information
i
have
to
give
you
tell
me
said
feversham
after
a
brief
pause
during
which
he
scrutinized
the
young
man
face
if
your
lordship
will
promise
liberty
and
to
my
sister
and
tell
me
feversham
repeated
when
you
have
promised
to
grant
me
what
i
ask
in
return
for
my
yes
if
i
your
information
is
wort
i
am
content
said
richard
he
inclined
his
head
and
loosed
the
quarrel
of
his
news
your
camp
is
slumbering
your
officers
are
all
abed
with
the
exception
of
the
outpost
on
the
road
to
bridgwater
what
should
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
monmouth
and
all
his
army
are
marching
upon
you
at
this
very
moment
will
probably
fall
upon
you
before
another
hour
is
past
wilding
uttered
a
groan
and
his
hands
fell
to
his
sides
had
feversham
observed
this
he
might
have
been
less
ready
with
his
sneering
answer
a
lie
he
answered
and
laughed
my
fren
i
myself
been
at
midnight
on
moore
and
i
army
of
duc
de
monmoot
marching
to
bristol
on
road
what
you
call
road
wentwort
the
eastern
causeway
my
lord
answered
the
captain
voil
said
feversham
and
spread
his
hands
what
you
say
now
eh
that
that
is
part
of
monmouth
plan
to
come
at
you
across
the
moors
by
way
of
chedzoy
avoiding
your
only
outpost
and
falling
upon
you
in
your
beds
all
unawares
lord
sir
do
not
take
my
word
for
it
send
out
your
scouts
and
i
dare
swear
they
not
need
go
far
before
they
come
upon
the
feversham
looked
at
wentworth
his
lordship
face
had
undergone
a
change
what
you
he
asked
indeed
my
lord
it
sounds
so
likely
answered
wentworth
that
that
i
marvel
we
did
not
provide
against
such
a
but
i
provide
cried
this
nephew
of
the
great
turenne
is
on
moor
and
sare
francis
compton
if
is
true
can
miss
monmoot
send
word
to
milor
churchill
at
once
wentwort
let
matter
be
investigate
at
once
wentwort
at
once
the
general
was
dancing
with
excitement
wentworth
saluted
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
if
you
tole
me
true
continued
feversham
turning
now
to
richard
you
shall
price
you
ask
and
of
king
army
but
if
not
oh
it
true
enough
broke
in
wilding
and
his
voice
was
like
a
groan
his
face
with
gloom
feversham
looked
at
him
his
sneering
smile
returned
me
i
not
remember
said
he
that
westercott
include
you
in
nothing
had
been
further
from
wilding
thoughts
than
such
a
suggestion
and
he
snorted
his
disdain
the
sergeant
had
fallen
back
at
words
and
his
men
lined
the
wall
of
the
chamber
the
general
bade
richard
be
seated
whilst
he
waited
sir
rowland
stood
apart
leaning
wearily
against
the
wainscot
waiting
also
his
dull
wits
not
quite
clear
how
richard
might
have
come
by
so
valuable
a
piece
of
information
his
evil
spirit
almost
wishing
it
untrue
in
his
vindictiveness
to
the
end
that
richard
might
pay
the
price
of
having
played
him
false
and
ruth
the
price
of
having
scorned
him
feversham
meanwhile
was
seeking
with
no
great
success
to
engage
wilding
in
talk
of
monmouth
against
whom
feversham
harboured
in
addition
to
his
political
enmity
a
very
deadly
personal
hatred
for
feversham
had
been
a
suitor
to
the
hand
of
the
lady
henrietta
wentworth
the
woman
for
whom
monmouth
worthy
son
of
his
father
had
practically
abandoned
his
own
wife
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
run
off
to
the
great
scandal
of
court
and
nation
despairing
of
drawing
any
useful
information
from
wilding
his
lordship
was
on
the
point
of
turning
to
blake
when
quick
steps
and
the
rattle
of
a
scabbard
sounded
without
the
door
was
thrust
open
without
ceremony
and
captain
wentworth
reappeared
my
lord
he
cried
his
manner
excited
beyond
aught
one
could
have
believed
possible
in
so
a
person
it
is
true
we
are
beset
echoed
feversham
beset
already
we
can
hear
them
moving
on
the
moor
they
are
crossing
the
langmoor
rhine
they
will
be
upon
us
in
ten
minutes
at
the
most
i
have
roused
colonel
douglas
and
dunbarton
regiment

ready
for
feversham
exploded
what
else
you
done
he
asked
where
is
milor
churchill
lord
churchill
is
mustering
his
men
as
quietly
as
may
be
that
they
may
be
ready
to
surprise
those
who
come
to
surprise
us
by
heaven
sir
we
owe
a
great
debt
to
westmacott
without
his
information
we
might
have
had
all
our
throats
cut
whilst
we
be
so
kind
to
call
belmont
said
feversham
tell
him
to
bring
my
wentworth
turned
and
went
out
again
to
execute
the
general
orders
feversham
spoke
to
richard
we
are
oblige
westercott
said
he
we
are
ver
much
suddenly
from
a
little
distance
came
the
roll
of
drums
other
sounds
began
to
stir
in
the
night
outside
to
tell
of
a
waking
army
feversham
stood
listening
it
is
dunbarton
he
murmured
then
with
some
show
of
heat
ah
pardieu
he
cried
but
it
was
a
dirty
monmoot
prepare
it
is
murder
it
is
not
war
and
yet
said
wilding
critically
it
is
a
little
more
like
war
than
the
bridgwater
affair
to
which
your
lordship
gave
your
feversham
pursed
his
lips
and
considered
the
speaker
wentworth
reentered
followed
by
the
earl
valet
carrying
an
armful
of
garments
his
lordship
threw
off
his
and
stood
forth
in
shirt
and
breeches
mais
donc
belmont
said
he
nous
nous
battons
ii
faut
que
je
belmont
a
little
wizened
fellow
who
understood
nothing
of
this
hastened
forward
deposited
his
armful
on
the
table
and
selected
a
finely
embroidered
waistcoat
which
he
proceeded
to
hold
for
his
master
wriggling
into
it
feversham
rapped
out
his
orders
captain
wentwort
you
will
go
to
your
regimen
at
once
but
first
ah
wait
take
six
men
and
mistaire

shot
at
once

belmont
my
chapter
xxii
the
execution
captain
wentworth
clicked
his
heels
together
and
saluted
blake
in
the
background
drew
a
deep
breath
unmistakably
of
satisfaction
and
his
eyes
glittered
a
muffled
cry
broke
from
ruth
who
rose
instantly
from
her
chair
her
hand
on
her
bosom
richard
stood
with
fallen
jaw
amazed
a
trifle
troubled
even
whilst
wilding
started
more
in
surprise
than
actual
fear
and
approached
the
table
you
heard
sir
said
captain
wentworth
i
heard
answered
wilding
quietly
but
surely
not
aright
one
moment
sir
and
he
waved
his
hand
so
compellingly
that
despite
the
order
he
had
received
the
phlegmatic
captain
hesitated
feversham
who
had
taken
the
cravat
a
yard
of
priceless
dutch
lace
from
the
hands
of
his
valet
and
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
company
at
a
small
and
very
faulty
mirror
that
hung
by
the
overmantel
looked
peevishly
over
his
shoulder
my
lord
said
wilding
and
blake
for
all
his
hatred
of
this
man
marvelled
at
a
composure
that
did
not
forsake
him
even
now
you
are
surely
not
proposing
to
deal
with
me
in

my
lord

said
the
frenchman
it
a
jest
if
you
please
what
for
you
come
assuredly
not
for
the
purpose
of
being
shot
said
wilding
and
actually
smiled
then
in
the
tones
of
one
discussing
a
matter
that
is
grave
but
not
of
surpassing
gravity
he
continued
it
is
not
that
i
fail
to
recognize
that
i
may
seem
to
have
incurred
the
rigour
of
the
law
but
these
matters
must
be
formally
proved
against
me

affairs
to
set
in
order

snapped
feversham
not

weutwort
you

and
he
returned
to
his
mirror
and
the
nice
adjustment
of
his
neckwear
but
my
lord
insisted
wilding
you
have
not
the
right
you
have
not
the
power
so
to
proceed
against
me
a
man
of
my
quality
is
not
to
be
shot
without
a
you
can
if
you
prefer
said
feversham
indifferently
drawing
out
the
ends
of
his
cravat
and
smoothing
them
down
upon
his
breast
he
faced
about
briskly

i
not

to

wentworth
hand
touched
wilding
on
the
shoulder
he
was
standing
with
head
slightly
bowed
his
brows
knit
in
thought
he
looked
round
at
the
touch
sighed
and
smiled
belmont
held
the
coat
for
his
master
who
slipped
into
it
and
flung
at
wilding
what
was
intended
for
a
consolatory
sop
it
is
fortune
de
guerre
mistaire
wilding
i
am
desolate
but
it
is
fortune
of
may
it
be
less
fortunate
for
your
lordship
then
said
wilding
dryly
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
when
ruth
voice
came
in
a
loud
cry
to
startle
him
and
to
quicken
his
pulses
my
lord
it
was
a
cry
of
utter
anguish
feversham
settling
his
coat
comfortably
to
his
figure
looked
at
her
madame
said
he
but
she
had
nothing
to
say
she
stood
deathly
white
slightly
bent
forward
one
hand
wringing
the
other
her
eyes
almost
wild
her
bosom
heaving
frantically
hum
said
feversham
and
he
loosened
and
removed
the
scarf
from
his
head
he
shrugged
slightly
and
looked
at
wentworth
finissons
said
he
the
word
and
the
look
snapped
the
trammels
that
bound
ruth
speech
five
minutes
my
lord
she
cried
imploringly
give
him
five
minutes
and
me
my
lord
wilding
deeply
shaken
trembled
now
as
he
awaited
feversham
reply
the
frenchman
seemed
to
waver
bien
he
began
spreading
his
hands
and
in
that
moment
a
shot
rang
out
in
the
night
and
startled
the
whole
company
feversham
threw
back
his
head
the
signs
of
yielding
left
his
face
ha
he
cried
are
he
snatched
his
wig
from
his
lacquey
hands
donned
it
and
turned
again
an
instant
to
the
mirror
to
adjust
the
great
curls
quick
wentwort
is
no
more
time
now
make
mistaire
wilding
be
shot
at
once
to
your
he
faced
about
and
took
the
sword
his
valet
proffered
au
revoir
messieurs
serviteur
madame
and
buckling
his
as
he
went
he
swept
out
leaving
the
door
wide
open
belmont
following
wentworth
saluting
and
the
guards
presenting
arms
come
sir
said
the
captain
in
a
subdued
voice
his
eyes
avoiding
ruth
face
i
am
ready
answered
wilding
firmly
and
he
turned
to
glance
at
his
wife
she
was
bending
towards
him
her
hands
held
out
such
a
look
on
her
face
as
almost
drove
him
mad
with
despair
reading
it
as
he
did
he
made
a
sound
deep
in
his
throat
before
he
found
words
give
me
one
minute
sir
one
minute
he
begged
wentworth
i
ask
no
more
than
wentworth
was
a
gentleman
and
not
but
he
was
a
soldier
and
had
received
his
orders
he
hesitated
between
the
instincts
of
the
two
conditions
and
what
time
he
did
so
there
came
a
clatter
of
hoofs
without
to
resolve
him
it
was
feversham
departing
you
shall
have
your
minute
sir
said
he
more
i
dare
not
give
you
as
you
can
see
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
answered
wilding
and
from
the
gratitude
of
his
tone
you
might
have
inferred
that
it
was
his
life
wentworth
had
accorded
him
the
captain
had
already
turned
aside
to
address
his
men
two
of
you
outside
guard
that
window
he
ordered
the
rest
of
you
in
the
passage
bestir
there
take
your
precautions
by
all
means
sir
said
wilding
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
shall
attempt
no
wentworth
nodded
without
replying
his
eye
lighted
on
blake
who
had
been
seemingly
forgotten
in
the
confusion
and
on
richard
a
kindliness
for
the
man
who
met
his
end
so
unflinchingly
a
respect
for
so
worthy
an
enemy
actuated
the
captain
you
had
better
take
yourself
off
sir
rowland
said
he
and
you
westmacott
you
can
wait
in
the
passage
with
my
they
obeyed
him
promptly
enough
but
when
outside
sir
rowland
made
bold
to
remind
the
captain
that
he
was
failing
in
his
duty
and
that
he
should
make
a
point
of
informing
the
general
of
this
anon
wentworth
bade
him
go
to
the
devil
and
so
was
rid
of
him
alone
inside
that
chamber
stood
ruth
and
wilding
face
to
face
he
advanced
towards
her
and
with
a
shuddering
sob
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
still
he
mistrusted
the
emotion
to
which
she
was
a
prey
dreading
lest
it
should
have
its
root
in
pity
he
patted
her
shoulder
soothingly
nay
nay
little
child
he
whispered
in
her
ear
never
weep
for
me
that
have
not
a
tear
for
myself
what
better
resolution
of
the
difficulties
my
folly
has
created
for
only
answer
she
clung
closer
her
hands
locked
about
his
neck
her
slender
body
shaken
by
her
silent
weeping
do
pity
me
he
besought
her
i
am
content
it
should
be
so
it
is
the
amend
i
promised
you
waste
no
pity
on
me
she
raised
her
face
her
eyes
wild
and
blurred
with
tears
looked
up
to
his
it
is
not
pity
she
cried
i
want
you
anthony
i
love
you
anthony
anthony
his
face
grew
ashen
it
is
true
then
he
asked
her
and
what
you
said
was
true
i
thought
you
said
it
only
to
detain
oh
it
is
true
it
is
true
she
wailed
he
sighed
he
disengaged
a
hand
to
stroke
her
face
i
am
happy
he
said
and
strove
to
smile
had
i
lived
who
knows
no
no
no
she
interrupted
him
passionately
her
arms
tightening
about
his
neck
he
bent
his
head
their
lips
met
and
clung
a
knock
fell
upon
the
door
they
started
and
wilding
raised
his
hands
gently
to
disengage
her
pinioning
arms
i
must
go
sweet
he
said
god
help
me
she
moaned
and
clung
to
him
still
it
is
i
who
am
killing
you
i
and
your
love
for
me
for
it
was
to
save
me
you
rode
hither
never
pausing
to
weigh
your
own
deadly
danger
oh
i
am
punished
for
having
listened
to
every
voice
but
the
voice
of
my
own
heart
where
you
were
concerned
had
i
loved
you
earlier
had
i
owned
it
earlier
it
had
still
been
too
late
he
said
more
to
comfort
her
than
because
he
knew
it
to
be
so
be
brave
for
my
sake
ruth
you
can
be
brave
i
know
so
well
listen
sweet
your
words
have
made
me
happy
mar
not
this
happiness
of
mine
by
sending
me
out
in
grief
at
your
her
response
to
his
prayer
was
brave
indeed
through
her
tears
came
a
faint
smile
to
overspread
her
face
so
white
and
pitiful
we
shall
meet
soon
again
she
said
aye
think
on
that
he
bade
her
and
pressed
her
to
him
sweet
god
keep
you
till
we
meet
he
added
his
voice
infinitely
tender
mr
wilding
wentworth
voice
called
him
and
the
captain
thrust
the
door
open
a
foot
or
so
mr
wilding
i
am
coming
he
answered
steadily
he
kissed
her
again
and
on
that
kiss
of
his
she
sank
against
him
and
he
felt
her
turn
all
limp
he
raised
his
voice
richard
he
shouted
wildly
richard
at
the
note
of
alarm
in
his
voice
wentworth
flung
wide
the
door
and
entered
richard
ashen
face
showing
over
his
shoulder
in
her
brother
care
wilding
delivered
his
mercifully
unconscious
wife
see
to
her
dick
he
said
and
turned
to
go
mistrusting
himself
now
but
he
paused
as
he
reached
the
door
wentworth
waxing
more
and
more
impatient
at
his
elbow
he
turned
again
dick
he
said
we
might
have
been
better
friends
i
would
we
had
been
let
us
part
so
at
least
and
he
held
out
his
hand
smiling
before
so
much
gallantry
richard
was
conquered
almost
to
the
point
of
worship
a
weak
man
himself
there
was
no
virtue
he
could
more
admire
than
strength
he
left
ruth
in
the
chair
in
which
tender
hands
had
placed
her
and
sprang
forward
tears
in
his
eyes
he
wrung
wilding
hands
in
wordless
passion
be
good
to
her
dick
said
wilding
and
went
out
with
wentworth
he
was
marched
down
the
street
in
the
centre
of
that
small
party
of
musketeers
of
dunbarton
regiment
his
thoughts
all
behind
him
rather
than
ahead
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
had
conquered
at
the
last
he
thought
of
that
other
parting
of
theirs
nearly
a
month
ago
on
the
road
by
walford
now
as
then
circumstance
was
the
fire
that
had
melted
her
but
the
crucible
was
no
longer
as
then
of
pity
it
was
the
crucible
of
love
and
in
that
same
crucible
too
anthony
wilding
nature
had
undergone
a
transmutation
his
love
for
ruth
had
been
purified
of
that
base
alloy
of
desire
which
had
driven
him
into
the
unworthiness
of
making
her
his
own
at
all
costs
there
was
no
carnal
grossness
in
his
present
passion
it
was
pure
as
a
religion
the
love
that
takes
no
account
of
self
the
love
that
makes
for
joyous
and
grateful
martyrdom
and
a
joyous
and
grateful
martyr
would
anthony
wilding
have
been
could
he
have
thought
that
his
death
would
bring
her
happiness
or
peace
in
such
a
faith
as
that
he
had
marched
or
so
he
thought
blithely
to
his
end
and
the
smile
on
his
lips
had
been
less
wistful
than
it
was
thinking
of
the
agony
in
which
he
had
left
her
he
almost
came
to
wish
so
pure
was
his
love
grown
that
he
had
not
conquered
the
joy
that
at
first
was
his
was
now
all
dashed
his
death
would
cause
her
pain
his
death
o
god
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
be
a
martyr
but
this
was
not
martyrdom
having
done
what
he
had
done
he
had
not
the
right
to
die
the
last
vestige
of
the
smile
that
he
had
worn
faded
from
his
lips
as
though
to
endure
some
physical
suffering
his
face
greyed
and
deep
lines
furrowed
his
brow
thus
he
marched
on
mechanically
amid
his
marching
escort
through
the
murky
night
taking
no
heed
of
the
stir
about
them
for
all
weston
zoyland
was
aroused
by
now
ahead
of
them
and
over
to
the
east
the
firing
blazed
and
crackled
volley
upon
volley
to
tell
them
that
already
battle
had
been
joined
in
earnest
monmouth
surprise
had
aborted
and
it
passed
through
wilding
mind
that
to
a
great
extent
he
was
to
blame
for
this
but
it
gave
him
little
care
at
least
his
indiscretion
had
served
the
purpose
of
rescuing
ruth
from
lord
feversham
unclean
clutches
for
the
rest
knowing
that
army
by
far
outnumbered
feversham
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
advantage
must
still
lie
with
the
duke
in
spite
of
feversham
having
been
warned
in
the
eleventh
hour
louder
grew
the
sounds
of
battle
above
the
din
of
firing
a
swelling
chorus
rose
upon
the
night
startling
and
weird
in
such
a
time
and
place
monmouth
pious
infantry
went
into
action
singing
hymns
and
wentworth
impatient
to
be
at
his
post
bade
his
men
go
faster
the
night
was
by
now
growing
faintly
luminous
and
the
deathly
grey
light
of
approaching
dawn
hung
in
the
mists
upon
the
moor
objects
grew
visible
in
bulk
at
least
if
not
in
form
and
shape
by
the
time
the
little
company
had
reached
the
end
of
weston
village
and
come
upon
the
deep
mud
dyke
which
had
been
wentworth
objective
a
ditch
that
communicated
with
the
great
rhine
that
served
the
king
forces
so
well
on
that
night
of
sedgemoor
within
some
twenty
paces
of
this
wentworth
called
a
halt
and
would
have
had
wilding
hands
pinioned
behind
him
and
his
eyes
blindfolded
but
that
wilding
begged
him
this
might
not
be
done
wentworth
was
as
we
know
impatient
and
between
impatience
and
kindliness
perhaps
he
acceded
to
wilding
prayer
he
even
hesitated
a
moment
at
the
last
it
was
in
his
mind
to
speak
some
word
of
comfort
to
the
doomed
man
then
a
sudden
volley
more
terrific
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
followed
by
hoarse
cheering
away
to
eastward
quickened
his
impatience
he
bade
the
sergeant
lead
wilding
forward
and
stand
him
on
the
edge
of
the
ditch
his
object
was
that
thus
the
man
body
would
be
disposed
of
without
waste
of
time
this
wilding
realized
his
soul
rebelling
against
this
fate
which
had
come
upon
him
in
the
very
hour
when
he
most
desired
to
live
mad
thoughts
of
escape
crossed
his
mind
of
a
leap
across
the
dyke
and
a
wild
dash
through
the
fog
but
the
futility
of
it
was
too
appalling
the
musketeers
were
already
blowing
their
matches
he
would
suffer
the
ignominy
of
being
shot
in
the
back
like
a
coward
if
he
made
any
such
attempt
and
so
despairing
but
not
resigned
he
took
his
stand
on
the
very
edge
of
the
ditch
in
an
irony
of
obligingness
he
set
half
of
his
heels
over
the
void
so
that
he
was
nicely
balanced
upon
the
edge
of
the
cutting
and
must
go
backwards
and
down
into
the
mud
when
hit
it
was
this
position
he
had
taken
that
gave
him
an
inspiration
in
that
last
moment
the
sergeant
had
moved
away
out
of
the
line
of
fire
and
he
stood
there
alone
waiting
erect
and
with
his
head
held
high
his
eyes
upon
the
grey
mass
of
musketeers
blurred
alike
by
mist
and
some
twenty
paces
distant
along
the
line
of
which
glowed
eight
red
fuses
wentworth
voice
rang
out
with
the
words
of
command
blow
your
matches
brighter
gleamed
the
points
of
light
and
under
their
steel
pots
the
faces
of
the
musketeers
suffused
by
a
dull
red
glow
sprang
for
a
moment
out
of
the
grey
mass
to
fade
once
more
into
the
general
greyness
at
the
word
cock
your
matches
guard
your
pans
came
a
second
later
the
captain
voice
and
then
present
there
was
a
stir
and
rattle
and
the
dark
indistinct
figure
standing
on
the
lip
of
the
ditch
was
covered
by
the
eight
muskets
to
the
eyes
of
the
he
was
no
more
than
a
blurred
shadowy
form
showing
a
little
darker
than
the
encompassing
dark
grey
give
fire
on
the
word
wilding
lost
the
delicate
precarious
balance
he
had
been
sustaining
on
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
went
over
backwards
at
the
imminent
risk
as
he
afterwards
related
of
breaking
his
neck
at
the
same
instant
a
jagged
line
of
flame
slashed
the
darkness
and
the
thunder
of
the
volley
pealed
forth
to
lose
itself
in
the
greater
din
of
battle
on
penzoy
pound
hard
by
chapter
xxiii
wilding
boots
in
the
filth
of
the
ditch
wilding
rolled
over
and
lay
prone
he
threw
out
his
left
arm
and
rested
his
brow
upon
it
to
keep
his
face
above
the
mud
he
strove
to
hold
his
breath
not
that
he
might
dissemble
death
but
that
he
might
avoid
being
poisoned
by
the
foul
gases
that
disturbed
by
his
weight
bubbled
up
to
choke
him
his
body
half
sank
and
settled
in
the
mud
and
seen
from
above
as
he
was
presently
seen
by
wentworth
who
ran
forward
with
the
sergeant
lanthorn
to
assure
himself
that
the
work
had
been
well
done
he
had
all
the
air
of
being
not
only
dead
but
already
half
buried
and
now
for
a
second
wilding
was
in
his
greatest
danger
and
this
from
the
very
humaneness
of
the
sergeant
the
fellow
advanced
to
the
captain
side
a
pistol
in
his
hand
wentworth
held
the
light
aloft
and
peered
down
into
that
six
feet
of
blackness
at
the
jacent
figure
shall
i
give
him
an
ounce
of
lead
to
make
sure
captain
quoth
the
sergeant
but
wentworth
in
his
great
haste
had
already
turned
about
and
the
light
of
his
lanthorn
no
longer
revealed
the
form
of
wilding
there
is
not
the
need
the
ditch
will
do
what
may
remain
to
be
done
if
anything
does
come
on
man
we
are
wanted
the
light
passed
steps
retreated
the
sergeant
muttering
and
then
wentworth
voice
was
heard
by
wilding
some
little
distance
off
bring
up
your
muskets
shoulder
by
the
right
turn
march
and
the
tramp
tramp
of
feet
receded
rapidly
wilding
was
already
sitting
up
endeavouring
to
get
a
breath
of
purer
air
he
rose
to
his
feet
sinking
almost
to
the
top
of
his
boots
in
the
oozy
slime
foul
gases
were
belched
up
to
envelop
him
he
seized
at
irregularities
in
the
bank
and
got
his
head
above
the
level
of
the
ground
he
thrust
forward
his
chin
and
took
great
greedy
breaths
in
a
very
gluttony
of
air
and
never
came
muscadine
sweeter
to
a
lips
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
he
was
alone
and
safe
wentworth
and
his
men
had
disappeared
away
in
the
direction
of
penzoy
pound
the
sounds
of
battle
swelled
ever
to
a
greater
volume
cannons
were
booming
now
and
all
was
uproar
flame
and
shouting
cheering
and
shrieking
the
thunder
of
hastening
multitudes
the
clash
of
steel
the
pounding
of
horses
all
blent
to
make
up
the
horrid
din
of
carnage
wilding
listened
and
considered
what
to
do
his
first
impulse
was
to
join
the
fray
but
bethinking
him
that
there
could
be
little
place
for
him
in
the
confusion
that
must
prevail
by
now
he
reconsidered
the
matter
and
his
thoughts
returning
to
ruth
the
wife
for
whom
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
preserve
himself
on
the
very
brink
of
death
he
resolved
to
endanger
himself
no
further
for
that
night
he
dropped
back
into
the
ditch
and
waded
ankle
deep
in
slime
to
the
other
side
there
he
crawled
out
and
gaining
the
moor
lay
down
awhile
to
breathe
his
lungs
but
not
for
long
the
dawn
was
creeping
pale
and
ghostly
across
the
solid
earth
and
a
faint
fresh
breeze
was
stirring
and
driving
the
mist
in
wispy
shrouds
before
it
if
he
lingered
there
he
might
yet
be
found
by
some
party
of
royalist
soldiers
and
that
would
be
to
undo
all
that
he
had
done
he
rose
and
struck
out
across
the
peaty
ground
none
knew
the
moors
better
than
did
he
and
had
he
been
with
grey
horse
that
night
it
is
possible
things
had
fared
differently
for
he
had
proved
a
surer
guide
than
did
godfrey
the
spy
at
first
he
thought
of
making
for
bridgwater
and
lupton
house
by
now
richard
would
be
on
his
way
thither
with
ruth
and
wilding
was
in
haste
that
she
should
be
reassured
that
he
had
not
fallen
to
the
muskets
of
wentworth
but
bridgwater
was
far
and
he
began
to
realize
now
that
all
excitement
was
past
that
he
was
utterly
exhausted
next
he
thought
of
scoresby
hall
and
his
cousin
lord
gervase
but
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
he
might
count
upon
a
welcome
gervase
had
shown
no
sympathy
for
monmouth
or
his
partisans
and
whilst
he
would
hardly
go
so
far
as
to
refuse
wilding
shelter
still
wilding
felt
an
aversion
to
seeking
what
might
be
grudged
him
at
last
he
bethought
him
of
home
zoyland
chase
was
near
at
hand
but
he
had
not
been
there
since
his
and
in
the
mean
time
he
knew
that
it
had
been
used
as
a
barrack
for
the
militia
and
had
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
wrecked
and
plundered
still
it
must
have
walls
and
a
roof
and
that
for
the
time
was
all
he
craved
that
he
might
rest
awhile
and
recuperate
his
wasted
forces
a
later
he
dragged
himself
wearily
up
the
avenue
between
the
elms
looking
white
as
snow
in
the
pale
july
dawn
to
the
clearing
in
front
of
his
house
desertion
was
stamped
upon
the
face
of
it
shattered
windows
and
hanging
shutters
everywhere
how
wantonly
they
had
wrecked
it
it
might
have
been
a
church
and
the
militia
a
regiment
of
cromwell
iconoclastic
puritans
the
door
was
locked
but
going
round
he
found
a
window
one
of
the
of
his
library
hanging
loose
upon
its
hinges
he
pushed
it
wide
and
entered
with
a
heavy
heart
instantly
something
stirred
in
a
corner
a
fierce
growl
was
followed
by
a
furious
bark
and
a
lithe
brown
body
leapt
from
the
greater
into
the
lesser
shadows
to
attack
the
intruder
but
at
one
word
of
his
the
hound
checked
suddenly
crouched
an
instant
then
with
a
queer
throaty
sound
bounded
forward
in
a
wild
delight
that
robbed
it
on
the
instant
of
its
voice
it
found
it
anon
and
leapt
about
him
barking
furious
joy
in
spite
of
all
his
vain
endeavours
to
calm
it
he
grew
afraid
lest
the
dog
should
draw
attention
he
knew
not
who
if
any
might
be
in
possession
of
his
house
the
library
as
he
looked
round
showed
a
scene
of
wreckage
that
excellently
matched
the
exterior
not
a
picture
on
the
walls
not
an
arras
but
had
been
rent
to
shreds
the
great
lustre
that
had
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
was
gone
disorder
reigned
along
the
bookshelves
and
yet
there
and
elsewhere
there
was
a
certain
orderliness
suggesting
an
attempt
to
straighten
up
the
place
after
the
ravagers
had
departed
it
was
these
signs
made
him
afraid
the
house
might
be
tenanted
by
such
as
might
prove
his
enemies
down
jack
he
said
to
the
dog
for
the
twentieth
time
patting
its
sleek
head
down
down
but
still
the
dog
bounded
about
him
barking
wildly
sh
he
hissed
suddenly
steps
sounded
in
the
hall
it
was
as
he
feared
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
and
the
grey
morning
light
gleamed
upon
the
long
barrel
of
a
musket
after
it
bearing
it
entered
a
old
man
he
paused
on
the
threshold
measuring
the
tall
disordered
stranger
who
stood
there
his
figure
a
black
silhouette
against
the
window
by
which
he
had
entered
what
seek
you
here
sir
in
this
house
of
desolation
asked
the
voice
of
wilding
old
servant
he
answered
but
one
word
walters
the
musket
dropped
with
a
clatter
from
the
old
man
hands
he
sank
back
against
the
doorpost
and
leaned
there
an
instant
then
whimpering
and
laughing
he
came
tottering
forward
his
old
legs
failing
him
in
this
excess
of
unexpected
joy
and
sank
on
his
knees
to
kiss
his
hand
wilding
patted
the
old
head
as
he
had
patted
the
dog
a
little
while
ago
he
was
oddly
moved
there
was
a
knot
in
his
throat
no
could
well
have
been
more
desolate
and
yet
what
could
have
brought
him
such
a
torturing
joy
as
was
now
his
oh
it
is
good
to
be
loved
if
it
be
by
no
more
than
a
dog
and
an
old
servant
in
a
moment
walters
was
himself
again
he
was
on
his
feet
scrutinizing
wilding
haggard
face
and
disordered
filthy
clothes
he
broke
into
exclamations
between
dismay
and
reproach
but
these
wilding
interrupted
to
ask
the
old
man
how
it
happened
that
he
had
remained
my
son
john
was
a
sergeant
in
the
troop
that
quartered
itself
here
sir
walters
explained
and
so
they
left
me
alone
but
even
had
it
not
been
for
that
i
scarcely
think
they
would
have
harmed
an
old
man
they
were
brave
fellows
for
all
the
mischief
they
did
here
and
they
seemed
to
have
little
heart
in
the
service
of
the
popish
king
it
was
the
officers
drove
them
on
to
all
this
damage
and
once
started
well
there
were
rogues
amongst
them
saw
a
chance
of
plunder
and
they
took
it
i
have
sought
to
put
the
place
to
rights
but
they
did
some
woeful
wanton
wilding
sighed
it
little
matter
perhaps
as
the
place
is
no
longer
mine
no
no
longer
yours
sir
i
an
attainted
outlaw
walters
he
explained
they
bestow
it
on
some
popish
unless
king
monmouth
can
follow
up
by
greater
victories
have
you
aught
a
man
may
eat
or
drink
meat
and
wine
fresh
linen
and
fresh
garments
did
old
walters
find
him
and
when
he
had
washed
eaten
and
drunk
wilding
wrapped
himself
in
a
and
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
on
a
settle
in
the
library
his
servant
and
his
dog
on
guard
not
above
an
hour
however
was
he
destined
to
enjoy
his
rest
the
light
had
grown
meanwhile
and
from
grey
it
had
turned
golden
the
heralds
of
the
sun
being
already
in
the
east
in
the
distance
the
firing
had
died
down
to
a
mere
occasional
boom
suddenly
old
walters
raised
his
head
to
listen
the
beat
of
hoofs
was
drawing
rapidly
near
so
near
that
presently
he
rose
in
alarm
for
a
horseman
was
pounding
up
the
avenue
had
drawn
rein
at
the
main
entrance
walters
knit
his
brows
in
perplexity
and
glanced
at
his
master
who
slept
on
utterly
worn
out
a
silent
pause
followed
lasting
some
minutes
then
it
was
the
dog
that
rose
with
a
growl
his
coat
bristling
and
an
instant
later
there
came
a
sharp
rapping
at
the
hall
door
sh
down
jack
whispered
walters
afraid
of
rousing
wilding
he
tiptoed
softly
across
the
room
picked
up
his
musket
and
calling
the
dog
went
out
a
great
fear
in
his
heart
but
not
for
himself
the
rapping
continued
growing
every
instant
more
urgent
so
urgent
that
walters
was
almost
reassured
here
was
no
enemy
but
surely
some
one
in
need
walters
opened
at
last
and
trenchard
grimy
of
face
and
hands
his
hat
shorn
of
its
plumes
his
clothes
torn
staggered
with
an
oath
across
the
threshold
walters
he
cried
thank
god
i
thought
you
be
here
but
i
certain
down
jack
the
hound
was
barking
madly
again
having
recognized
an
old
friend
plague
on
the
dog
growled
walters
he
wake
mr
wilding
said
trenchard
and
checked
midway
across
the
hall
mr
wilding
he
arrived
here
a
couple
of
hours
ago
sir
wilding
here
oddsheart
i
was
more
than
well
advised
to
come
where
is
he
man
sh
sir
he
asleep
in
the
library
you
wake
him
you
wake
him
but
trenchard
never
paused
he
crossed
the
hall
at
a
bound
and
flung
wide
the
library
door
anthony
he
shouted
anthony
and
in
the
background
walters
cursed
him
for
a
fool
wilding
leapt
to
his
feet
awake
and
startled
wha
nick
oons
roared
nick
you
choicely
found
i
came
to
send
to
bridgwater
for
you
we
must
away
at
once
how
away
i
thought
you
were
in
the
fight
and
do
i
look
as
if
i
had
been
but
then
the
fight
is
fought
and
lost
there
an
end
to
the
garboil
monmouth
is
in
full
flight
with
what
left
him
of
his
horse
when
i
quitted
the
field
he
was
riding
hard
for
polden
he
dropped
into
a
chair
his
accents
grim
and
despairing
his
eyes
haggard
lost
gasped
wilding
and
his
conscience
pricked
him
for
a
moment
remembering
how
much
it
had
been
his
fault
however
indirectly
that
feversham
had
been
forewarned
but
how
lost
he
cried
a
moment
later
ask
grey
snapped
trenchard
ask
his
craven
numskulled
lordship
he
had
as
good
a
hand
in
losing
it
as
any
oh
it
was
all
most
infernally
mishandled
as
has
been
everything
in
this
rising
grey
sent
back
godfrey
the
guide
and
attempted
in
the
dark
to
find
his
own
way
across
the
rhine
he
missed
the
ford
what
else
could
the
fool
have
hoped
and
when
he
was
discovered
and
dunbarton
guns
began
to
play
on
us
hell
and
fire
we
ran
as
if
sedgemoor
had
been
a
the
rest
was
but
the
natural
sequel
the
foot
seeing
our
confusion
broke
they
were
rallied
again
broke
again
and
again
were
rallied
but
all
too
late
the
enemy
was
up
and
with
that
damned
ditch
between
us
there
was
no
getting
to
close
quarters
with
them
had
grey
ridden
round
and
sought
to
turn
their
flank
things
might
have
been
o
god
they
would
have
been
entirely
different
i
did
suggest
it
but
for
my
pains
grey
threatened
to
pistol
me
if
i
presumed
to
instruct
him
in
his
duty
i
would
to
heaven
i
had
pistolled
him
where
he
walters
at
gaze
in
the
doorway
listened
to
the
bitter
tirade
wilding
on
the
settle
sat
silent
a
moment
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
in
his
hands
his
eyes
set
and
grim
as
trenchard
own
then
he
mastered
himself
and
waved
a
hand
towards
the
table
where
stood
food
and
wine
eat
and
drink
nick
he
said
and
we
discuss
what
to
be
it
need
little
discussing
was
nick
savage
answer
as
he
rose
and
went
to
pour
himself
a
cup
of
wine
there
but
one
course
open
to
us
instant
flight
i
am
for
minehead
to
join
hewling
horse
which
went
there
yesterday
for
guns
we
might
seize
a
ship
somewhere
on
the
coast
and
thus
get
out
of
this
infernal
country
of
they
discussed
the
matter
in
spite
of
trenchard
having
said
that
there
was
nothing
to
discuss
and
in
the
end
wilding
agreed
to
go
with
him
what
choice
had
he
but
first
he
must
go
to
bridgwater
to
reassure
his
wife
to
bridgwater
blazed
trenchard
in
a
passion
at
the
folly
of
the
suggestion
you
clearly
mad
all
the
king
forces
will
be
there
in
an
hour
or
no
matter
said
wilding
i
must
go
i
am
dead
already
as
it
and
he
related
his
singular
adventure
in
feversham
camp
last
night
trenchard
heard
him
in
amazement
if
any
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
his
friend
love
affairs
had
had
anything
to
do
with
rousing
feversham
prematurely
he
showed
no
sign
of
it
but
he
shook
his
head
at
insistence
that
he
must
first
go
to
lupton
house
shalt
send
a
message
anthony
walters
will
find
some
one
to
bear
it
but
you
must
not
go
in
the
end
trenchard
prevailed
upon
him
to
adopt
this
course
however
reluctant
he
might
be
thereafter
they
proceeded
to
make
their
preparations
there
were
still
a
couple
of
nags
in
the
stables
in
spite
of
the
visitation
of
the
militia
and
walters
was
able
to
find
fresh
clothes
for
trenchard
a
later
they
were
ready
to
set
out
on
this
forlorn
hope
of
escape
the
horses
were
at
the
door
and
wilding
was
in
the
act
of
drawing
on
the
fresh
pair
of
boots
which
walters
had
fetched
him
suddenly
he
paused
his
foot
in
the
leg
of
his
right
boot
and
sat
bemused
a
moment
trenchard
watching
him
waxed
impatient
what
ails
you
now
he
croaked
without
answering
him
wilding
turned
to
walters
where
are
the
boots
i
wore
last
night
he
asked
and
his
voice
was
sharp
oddly
sharp
considering
how
trivial
the
matter
of
his
speech
in
the
kitchen
answered
walters
fetch
me
and
he
kicked
off
again
the
boot
he
had
half
drawn
on
but
they
are
all
befouled
with
mud
clean
them
walters
clean
them
and
let
me
have
still
walters
hesitated
pointing
out
that
the
boots
he
had
brought
his
master
were
newer
and
sounder
wilding
interrupted
him
impatiently
do
as
i
bid
you
and
the
old
man
understanding
nothing
went
off
on
the
errand
a
pox
on
your
boots
swore
trenchard
what
does
this
mean
wilding
seemed
suddenly
to
have
undergone
a
transformation
his
gloom
had
fallen
from
him
he
looked
up
at
his
old
friend
and
smiling
answered
him
it
means
nick
that
whilst
these
excellent
boots
that
walters
would
have
me
wear
might
be
well
enough
for
a
ride
to
the
coast
such
as
you
propose
they
are
not
at
all
suited
to
the
journey
i
intend
to
maybe
said
nick
with
a
sniff
you
intending
to
journey
to
tower
hill
in
that
direction
answered
wilding
suavely
i
am
for
london
nick
and
you
shall
come
with
god
save
us
do
you
keep
a
fool
egg
under
that
nest
of
hair
wilding
explained
and
by
the
time
walters
returned
with
the
boots
trenchard
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
an
odd
agitation
odds
my
life
tony
he
cried
at
last
i
believe
it
is
the
best
the
only
thing
and
since
all
is
lost
why
trenchard
blew
out
his
cheeks
and
smacked
fist
into
palm
i
am
with
you
said
he
chapter
xxiv
justice
it
has
fallen
to
my
lot
in
the
course
of
this
veridical
chronicle
of
anthony
wilding
connection
with
the
rebellion
in
the
west
and
of
his
wedding
and
winning
of
ruth
westmacott
to
relate
certain
matters
of
incident
and
personality
that
may
be
accounted
strange
but
the
strangest
yet
remains
to
be
related
for
in
spite
of
all
that
had
passed
between
sir
rowland
blake
and
the
westmacotts
on
that
memorable
night
of
sunday
to
monday
on
which
the
battle
of
sedgemoor
was
lost
and
won
towards
the
end
of
that
same
month
of
july
we
find
him
not
only
back
at
lupton
house
but
once
again
the
avowed
suitor
of
widow
for
effrontery
this
is
a
matter
of
which
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
history
furnishes
a
parallel
indeed
until
the
circumstances
are
sifted
it
seems
wild
and
incredible
so
let
us
consider
these
on
the
morrow
of
sedgemoor
the
town
of
bridgwater
became
invested
infested
were
no
whit
too
strong
a
word
by
the
king
forces
under
feversham
and
the
odious
kirke
and
there
began
a
reign
of
terror
for
the
town
the
prisons
were
choked
with
attainted
and
suspected
rebels
from
bridgwater
to
weston
zoyland
the
road
was
become
an
avenue
of
gallows
each
bearing
its
repulsive
burden
for
the
king
commands
were
unequivocal
and
hanging
was
the
order
of
the
day
it
is
not
my
desire
at
this
stage
to
surfeit
you
with
the
horrors
that
were
perpetrated
during
that
hideous
week
of
july
when
no
man
life
was
safe
from
the
royal
butchers
the
awful
campaign
of
jeffries
and
his
four
associates
was
yet
to
follow
but
it
is
doubtful
if
it
could
compare
in
ruthlessness
with
that
of
feversham
and
kirke
at
least
when
jeffries
came
men
were
given
a
trial
or
what
looked
like
it
and
there
remained
them
a
chance
however
slender
of
acquittal
as
many
lived
to
prove
thereafter
with
feversham
there
was
no
such
chance
and
it
was
of
this
circumstance
that
sir
rowland
blake
took
the
fullest
and
the
cowardliest
advantage
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
sir
rowland
was
a
villain
it
might
be
urged
for
him
that
he
was
a
creature
of
circumstance
and
that
had
circumstances
been
other
it
is
possible
he
had
been
a
credit
to
his
name
but
he
was
weak
in
character
and
out
of
that
weakness
he
had
developed
a
herculean
strength
in
villainy
failure
had
dogged
him
in
everything
he
undertook
broken
at
the
hounded
out
of
town
by
creditors
he
was
in
desperate
straits
to
repair
his
fortunes
and
as
we
have
seen
he
was
not
nice
in
his
endeavours
to
achieve
that
end
ruth
westmacott
fair
inheritance
had
seemed
an
easy
thing
to
conquer
and
to
its
conquest
he
had
applied
himself
to
suffer
defeat
as
he
had
suffered
it
in
all
things
else
but
sir
rowland
did
not
yet
acknowledge
himself
beaten
and
the
bridgwater
reign
of
terror
dealt
him
a
fresh
hand
a
hand
of
trumps
with
this
he
came
boldly
to
renew
the
game
he
was
as
smooth
as
oil
at
first
a
very
penitent
confessing
himself
mad
in
what
he
had
done
on
that
sunday
night
mad
with
despair
and
rage
at
having
been
defeated
in
the
noble
task
to
which
he
had
turned
his
hands
his
penitence
might
have
had
little
effect
upon
the
westmacotts
had
he
not
known
how
to
insinuate
that
it
might
be
best
for
them
to
lend
an
ear
to
it
and
a
forgiving
one
you
will
tell
westmacott
jasper
he
had
said
when
jasper
told
him
that
they
could
not
receive
him
that
he
would
be
unwise
not
to
see
me
and
the
same
to
mistress
and
old
jasper
had
carried
his
message
and
had
told
richard
of
the
wicked
smile
that
had
been
on
sir
rowland
lips
when
he
had
uttered
it
now
richard
was
in
many
ways
a
changed
man
since
that
night
at
weston
zoyland
a
transformation
seemed
to
have
been
wrought
in
him
as
odd
as
it
was
sudden
and
it
dated
from
the
moment
when
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
had
wrung
wilding
hand
in
farewell
where
precept
had
failed
richard
found
himself
converted
by
example
he
contrasted
himself
in
that
stressful
hour
with
anthony
wilding
and
saw
himself
as
he
was
a
weakling
strong
only
in
vicious
ways
repentance
claimed
him
repentance
and
a
fine
ambition
to
be
worthier
to
resemble
as
nearly
as
his
nature
would
allow
him
this
anthony
wilding
whom
he
took
for
pattern
he
changed
his
ways
abandoned
drink
and
gaming
and
gained
thereby
a
healthier
countenance
then
in
his
zeal
he
overshot
his
mark
he
developed
a
taste
for
bethought
him
of
prayers
and
even
took
to
saying
grace
to
his
meat
indeed
for
conversion
when
it
comes
is
a
furious
thing
the
swing
of
his
soul
pendulum
threatened
now
to
carry
him
to
extremes
of
virtue
and
piety
o
lord
he
would
cry
a
score
of
times
a
day
thou
hast
brought
up
my
soul
from
the
grave
thou
hast
kept
me
alive
that
i
should
not
go
down
to
the
pit
but
underlying
all
this
remained
unfortunately
the
inherent
weakness
of
his
nature
indeed
it
was
that
very
weakness
and
malleability
made
this
sudden
and
wholesale
conversion
possible
upon
hearing
sir
rowland
message
his
heart
fainted
despite
his
good
intentions
and
he
urged
that
perhaps
they
had
better
hear
what
the
baronet
might
have
to
say
it
was
three
days
after
sedgemoor
fight
and
poor
ruth
was
worn
and
exhausted
with
her
grief
believing
wilding
dead
for
he
had
sent
no
message
to
inform
her
of
his
almost
miraculous
preservation
the
thing
he
went
to
do
in
london
was
fraught
with
such
peril
that
he
foresaw
but
the
slenderest
chance
of
escaping
with
his
life
therefore
he
had
argued
why
console
her
now
with
news
that
he
lived
when
in
a
few
days
the
headsman
might
prove
that
his
end
had
been
but
postponed
to
do
so
might
be
to
give
her
cause
to
mourn
him
twice
again
he
was
haunted
by
the
thought
that
in
spite
of
all
it
may
have
been
pity
that
had
so
grievously
moved
her
at
their
last
meeting
better
then
to
wait
better
for
both
their
sakes
if
he
came
safely
through
his
ordeal
it
would
be
time
enough
to
bear
her
news
of
his
preservation
in
deepest
mourning
very
white
with
dark
stains
beneath
her
eyes
to
tell
the
tale
of
anguished
vigils
she
received
sir
rowland
in
the
her
brother
at
her
side
to
his
expressions
of
deep
penitence
he
found
them
cold
so
he
passed
on
to
show
them
what
disastrous
results
might
ensue
upon
a
stubborn
maintaining
of
this
attitude
of
theirs
towards
him
i
have
come
he
said
his
eyes
downcast
his
face
for
he
could
play
the
sorrowful
with
any
hypocrite
in
england
to
do
something
more
than
speak
of
my
grief
and
regret
i
have
come
to
offer
proof
of
it
by
service
we
ask
no
service
of
you
sir
said
ruth
her
voice
a
sword
of
sharpness
he
sighed
and
turned
to
richard
this
were
folly
he
assured
his
whilom
friend
you
know
the
influence
i
do
i
quoth
richard
his
tone
implying
doubt
you
think
that
the
bungled
matter
at
newlington
may
have
shaken
it
quoth
blake
with
feversham
perhaps
but
albemarle
remember
trusts
me
very
fully
there
are
ugly
happenings
in
the
town
here
men
are
being
hung
like
linen
on
a
be
not
too
sure
that
yourself
are
free
from
all
richard
paled
under
the
baronet
baleful
glance
be
not
in
too
great
haste
to
cast
me
aside
for
you
may
find
me
do
you
threaten
sir
cried
ruth
threaten
quoth
he
he
turned
up
his
eyes
and
showed
the
whites
of
them
is
it
to
threaten
to
promise
you
my
protection
to
show
you
how
i
can
serve
you
than
which
i
ask
no
sweeter
boon
of
heaven
a
word
from
me
and
richard
need
fear
he
need
fear
nothing
without
that
word
said
ruth
disdainfully
such
service
as
he
did
lord
feversham
the
other
night
is
soon
forgotten
blake
cut
in
adroitly
indeed
be
most
convenient
to
his
lordship
to
forget
it
think
you
he
would
care
to
have
it
known
that
was
to
such
a
chance
he
owes
the
preservation
of
his
army
he
laughed
and
added
in
a
voice
of
much
sly
meaning
the
times
are
full
of
peril
there
kirke
and
his
lambs
and
there
no
saying
how
kirke
might
act
did
he
chance
to
learn
what
richard
failed
to
do
that
night
when
he
was
left
to
guard
the
rear
at
newlington
would
you
inform
him
of
it
cried
richard
between
anger
and
alarm
blake
thrust
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
horrified
repudiation
richard
he
cried
in
deep
reproof
and
again
richard
what
other
tongue
has
he
to
fear
asked
ruth
am
i
the
only
one
who
knows
of
it
cried
blake
oh
madam
why
will
you
ever
do
me
such
injustice
richard
has
been
my
friend
my
dearest
friend
i
wish
him
so
to
continue
and
i
swear
that
he
shall
find
me
his
as
you
shall
find
me
it
is
a
boon
i
could
dispense
with
she
assured
him
and
rose
this
talk
can
profit
little
sir
rowland
said
she
you
seek
to
you
shall
see
how
unjust
you
are
he
cried
with
deep
sorrow
it
is
but
fitting
perhaps
after
what
has
passed
it
is
my
punishment
but
you
shall
come
to
acknowledge
that
you
have
done
me
wrong
you
shall
see
how
i
shall
befriend
and
protect
that
said
he
took
his
leave
and
went
but
he
left
behind
him
a
shrewd
seed
of
fear
in
richard
mind
and
of
the
growth
that
sprang
from
it
richard
almost
unconsciously
transplanted
something
in
the
days
that
followed
into
the
heart
of
ruth
as
a
result
to
make
sure
that
no
harm
should
come
to
her
brother
the
last
of
his
name
and
race
she
resolved
to
receive
sir
rowland
resolved
in
spite
of
diana
outspoken
scorn
in
spite
of
richard
protests
for
though
afraid
yet
he
would
not
have
it
so
in
spite
even
of
her
own
deep
repugnance
of
the
man
days
passed
and
grew
to
weeks
bridgwater
was
settling
down
to
peace
again
to
peace
and
mourning
the
royalist
scourge
had
spread
to
taunton
and
blake
lingered
on
at
lupton
house
an
unwelcome
but
an
undeniable
guest
his
presence
was
as
detestable
to
richard
now
as
it
was
to
ruth
for
richard
had
to
submit
to
the
mockery
with
which
the
town
rake
lashed
his
godly
bearing
and
altered
ways
more
than
once
in
gusts
of
sudden
valour
the
boy
urged
his
sister
to
permit
him
to
drive
the
baronet
from
the
house
and
let
him
do
his
worst
but
ruth
afraid
for
richard
bade
him
wait
until
the
times
were
more
settled
when
the
royal
vengeance
had
slaked
its
lust
for
blood
it
might
matter
little
perhaps
what
tales
sir
rowland
might
elect
to
carry
and
so
sir
rowland
remained
and
waited
he
assured
himself
that
he
knew
how
to
be
patient
and
congratulated
himself
upon
that
circumstance
wilding
dead
a
little
time
must
now
suffice
to
blunt
the
sharp
edge
of
his
widow
grief
let
him
but
await
that
time
and
the
rest
should
be
easy
the
battle
his
with
richard
he
did
not
so
much
as
trouble
himself
to
reckon
thus
he
determined
and
thus
no
doubt
he
would
have
acted
but
for
an
unforeseen
contingency
a
miserable
paltry
creditor
had
smoked
him
out
in
his
somerset
retreat
and
got
a
letter
to
him
full
of
dark
hints
of
a
debtor
gaol
the
fellow
name
was
swiney
and
sir
rowland
knew
him
for
fierce
and
pertinacious
where
a
defaulting
creditor
was
concerned
one
only
course
remained
him
to
force
matters
with
wilding
widow
for
days
he
refrained
fearing
that
precipitancy
might
lose
him
all
it
was
his
wish
to
do
the
thing
without
too
much
coercion
some
he
was
not
coxcomb
enough
to
think
coxcomb
though
he
was
might
be
dispensed
with
at
last
one
sunday
evening
he
decided
to
be
done
with
dallying
and
to
bring
ruth
between
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
of
his
will
it
was
the
last
sunday
in
july
exactly
three
weeks
after
sedgemoor
and
the
odd
coincidence
of
his
having
chosen
such
a
day
and
hour
you
shall
appreciate
anon
they
were
on
the
lawn
taking
the
cool
of
the
evening
after
an
oppressively
hot
day
by
the
stone
seat
now
occupied
by
lady
horton
and
diana
richard
lay
on
the
sward
at
their
feet
in
talk
with
them
and
their
talk
was
of
sir
rowland
diana
gall
in
her
soul
to
see
the
baronet
by
way
of
gaining
yet
his
ends
chid
richard
in
strong
terms
for
his
weakness
in
submitting
to
blake
constant
presence
at
lupton
house
and
richard
meekly
took
her
chiding
and
promised
that
if
ruth
would
but
sanction
it
things
should
be
changed
upon
the
morrow
sir
rowland
all
unconscious
reckless
indeed
of
this
sauntered
with
ruth
some
little
distance
from
them
having
contrived
adroitly
to
draw
her
aside
he
broke
a
spell
of
silence
with
a
dolorous
sigh
ruth
said
he
pensively
i
mind
me
of
the
last
evening
on
which
you
and
i
walked
here
she
flashed
him
a
glance
of
fear
and
aversion
and
stood
still
under
his
brow
he
watched
the
quick
heave
of
her
bosom
the
sudden
flow
and
abiding
ebb
of
blood
in
her
face
grown
now
so
thin
and
wistful
and
he
realized
that
before
him
lay
no
easy
task
he
set
his
teeth
for
battle
will
you
never
have
a
kindness
for
me
ruth
he
sighed
she
turned
about
her
intent
to
join
the
others
a
dull
anger
in
her
soul
he
sat
a
hand
upon
her
arm
wait
said
he
and
the
tone
in
which
he
uttered
that
one
word
kept
her
beside
him
his
manner
changed
a
little
i
am
tired
of
this
said
he
why
so
am
i
she
answered
bitterly
since
we
are
agreed
so
far
let
us
agree
to
end
it
is
all
i
yes
but
alas
in
a
different
way
listen
i
will
not
listen
let
me
i
were
your
enemy
did
i
do
so
for
you
would
know
hereafter
a
sorrow
and
repentance
for
which
nothing
short
of
death
could
offer
you
escape
richard
is
under
do
you
hark
back
to
that
the
scorn
of
her
voice
was
deadly
had
it
been
herself
he
desired
surely
that
tone
had
quenched
all
passion
in
him
or
else
transformed
it
into
hatred
but
blake
was
playing
for
a
fortune
for
shelter
from
a
debtor
prison
it
has
become
known
he
continued
that
richard
was
one
of
the
early
plotters
who
paved
the
way
for
monmouth
coming
i
think
that
that
in
conjunction
with
his
betrayal
of
his
trust
that
night
at
newlington
thereby
causing
the
death
of
some
twenty
gallant
fellows
of
king
james
will
be
enough
to
hang
her
hand
clutched
at
her
heart
what
you
seek
she
cried
it
was
almost
a
moan
what
you
want
of
me
yourself
said
he
i
love
you
ruth
he
added
and
stepped
close
up
to
her
o
god
she
cried
aloud
had
i
a
man
at
hand
to
kill
you
for
that
insult
and
then
miracle
of
miracles
a
voice
from
the
shrubs
by
which
they
stood
bore
to
her
ears
the
startling
words
that
told
her
her
prayer
was
answered
there
and
then
madam
that
man
is
she
stood
frozen
not
more
of
a
statue
was
lot
wife
in
the
moment
of
looking
behind
her
than
she
who
dared
not
look
behind
that
voice
a
voice
from
the
dead
a
voice
she
had
heard
for
the
last
time
in
the
cottage
that
was
feversham
lodging
at
weston
zoyland
her
wild
eyes
fell
upon
sir
rowland
face
it
showed
livid
the
sucked
in
and
caught
in
the
strong
teeth
as
if
to
prevent
an
outcry
the
eyes
wild
with
fright
what
did
it
mean
by
an
effort
she
wrenched
herself
round
at
last
and
a
scream
broke
from
her
to
rouse
her
aunt
her
cousin
and
her
brother
and
bring
them
hastening
towards
her
across
the
sweep
of
lawn
before
her
on
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
a
grey
figure
stood
erect
and
graceful
and
the
face
with
its
thin
lips
faintly
smiling
its
dark
eyes
gleaming
was
the
face
of
anthony
wilding
and
as
she
stared
he
moved
forward
and
she
heard
the
fall
of
his
foot
upon
the
turf
the
clink
of
his
spurs
the
swish
of
his
scabbard
against
the
shrubs
and
reason
told
her
that
this
was
no
ghost
she
held
out
her
arms
to
him
anthony
anthony
she
staggered
forward
and
he
was
no
more
than
in
time
to
catch
her
as
she
swayed
he
held
her
fast
against
him
and
kissed
her
brow
sweet
he
said
forgive
me
that
i
frightened
you
i
came
by
the
orchard
gate
and
my
coming
was
so
timely
that
i
could
not
hold
in
my
answer
to
your
her
eyelids
fluttered
she
drew
a
long
sighing
breath
and
nestled
closer
to
him
anthony
she
murmured
again
and
reached
up
a
hand
to
stroke
his
face
to
feel
that
it
was
truly
living
flesh
and
sir
rowland
realizing
too
by
now
that
here
was
no
ghost
recovered
his
lost
courage
he
put
a
hand
to
his
sword
then
withdrew
it
leaving
the
weapon
sheathed
here
was
a
hangman
job
not
a
swordsman
he
opined
and
wisely
for
he
had
had
earlier
experience
of
wilding
play
of
steel
he
advanced
a
step
o
fool
he
snarled
the
hangman
waits
for
and
a
creditor
for
you
sir
rowland
came
the
voice
of
trenchard
who
now
pushed
forward
through
those
same
shrubs
that
had
masked
his
friend
approach
a
swiney
was
i
sent
him
from
town
lodged
at
the
bull
and
bellows
like
one
when
he
speaks
of
what
you
owe
him
there
are
three
messengers
with
him
and
they
tell
of
a
gaol
for
you
a
spasm
of
fury
crossed
the
face
of
blake
they
may
have
me
and
welcome
when
i
told
my
tale
said
he
let
me
but
tell
of
anthony
wilding
lurking
here
and
not
only
anthony
wilding
but
all
the
rest
of
you
are
doomed
for
harbouring
him
you
know
the
law
i
think
he
mocked
them
for
lady
horton
diana
and
richard
who
had
come
up
stood
now
a
pace
or
so
away
in
deepest
wonder
you
shall
know
it
better
before
the
night
is
out
and
better
still
before
next
sunday
tush
said
trenchard
and
quoted
none
but
anthony
may
conquer
anthony
is
clear
said
wilding
you
take
me
for
a
rebel
an
odd
mistake
for
it
chances
sir
rowland
that
you
behold
in
me
an
accredited
servant
of
the
secretary
of
blake
stared
then
fell
a
prey
to
ironic
laughter
he
would
have
spoken
but
wilding
plucked
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
trenchard
show
it
him
said
he
and
blake
face
grew
white
again
as
he
read
the
lines
above
sunderland
signature
and
observed
the
seals
of
office
he
looked
from
the
paper
to
the
hated
smiling
face
of
wilding
you
were
a
spy
he
said
his
tone
making
a
question
of
the
odious
statement
a
dirty
spy
your
incredulity
is
flattering
at
least
said
wilding
pleasantly
as
he
repocketed
the
parchment
and
it
leads
you
in
the
right
direction
i
neither
was
nor
am
a
that
paper
proves
it
cried
blake
contemptuously
having
been
a
spy
himself
he
was
a
good
judge
of
the
vileness
of
the
office
see
to
my
wife
nick
said
wilding
sharply
and
made
as
if
to
transfer
her
to
the
care
of
his
friend
nay
said
trenchard
is
your
own
duty
that
let
me
discharge
the
other
for
and
he
stepped
up
to
blake
and
tapped
him
briskly
on
the
shoulder
sir
rowland
said
he
you
a
sir
rowland
stared
at
him
you
a
foul
thing
a
muckworm
sir
rowland
added
trenchard
amiably
and
you
been
discourteous
to
a
lady
for
which
may
heaven
forgive
you
i
stand
aside
blake
bade
him
hoarse
with
passion
blind
to
all
risks
my
affair
is
with
aye
said
trenchard
but
mine
is
with
you
if
you
survive
it
you
can
settle
what
other
affairs
you
please
including
belike
your
business
with
not
so
nick
said
wilding
suddenly
and
turned
to
richard
here
richard
take
her
he
bade
his
anthony
you
damned
see
to
your
wife
leave
me
to
my
own
diversions
sir
rowland
he
reminded
the
baronet
i
have
called
you
a
knave
and
a
foul
thing
and
faith
if
you
want
it
proven
you
need
but
step
down
the
orchard
with
he
saw
hesitation
lingering
in
sir
rowland
face
and
he
uncurled
the
last
of
the
whip
he
carried
i
grieve
to
do
a
violent
thing
before
the
ladies
he
murmured
deprecatingly
i
never
respect
myself
again
if
i
had
to
drive
a
gentleman
of
your
quality
to
the
ground
of
honour
with
a
horsewhip
but
as
god
my
life
if
you
do
go
willingly
this
instant
is
what
will
richard
newborn
righteousness
prompted
him
to
interfere
to
seek
to
avert
this
threatened
bloodshed
his
humanity
urged
him
to
let
matters
be
and
his
humanity
prevailed
diana
watched
this
foreshadowing
of
tragedy
with
tight
lips
pale
cheeks
justice
was
to
be
done
at
last
it
seemed
and
as
her
frightened
eye
fell
upon
sir
rowland
she
knew
not
whether
to
exult
or
weep
her
mother
understanding
nothing
plied
her
meanwhile
with
whispered
questions
as
for
sir
rowland
he
looked
into
the
old
rake
eyes
agleam
with
wicked
mirth
and
rage
welled
up
to
choke
him
he
must
kill
this
man
come
said
he
i
see
to
your
fine
friend
wilding
excellent
said
trenchard
and
led
the
way
through
the
shrubbery
to
the
orchard
ruth
reviving
looked
up
her
glance
met
wilding
it
quickened
into
understanding
and
she
stirred
is
it
true
is
it
really
true
she
cried
i
am
being
tortured
by
this
dream
again
nay
sweet
it
is
true
it
is
true
i
am
here
say
shall
i
stay
she
clung
to
him
for
answer
and
you
are
in
no
danger
in
none
sweet
i
am
wilding
of
zoyland
chase
free
to
come
and
go
as
best
shall
seem
to
he
begged
the
others
to
leave
them
a
little
while
and
he
led
her
to
the
stone
seat
by
the
river
he
set
her
at
his
side
there
and
told
her
the
story
of
his
escape
from
the
and
of
the
inspiration
that
had
come
to
him
on
the
morrow
to
make
use
of
the
letter
in
his
boot
which
sunderland
had
given
him
for
monmouth
in
the
hour
of
panic
monmouth
cavalier
treatment
of
him
when
he
had
arrived
in
bridgwater
had
precluded
his
delivering
that
letter
at
the
council
there
was
never
another
opportunity
nor
did
he
again
think
of
the
package
in
the
stressful
hours
that
followed
it
was
not
until
the
following
morning
that
he
suddenly
remembered
it
lay
undelivered
and
bethought
him
that
it
might
prove
a
weapon
to
win
him
delivery
from
the
dangers
that
encompassed
him
it
was
a
slender
chance
he
told
her
but
i
employed
it
i
waited
in
london
in
hiding
close
upon
a
fortnight
ere
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
sunderland
he
laughed
me
to
scorn
at
first
and
threatened
me
with
the
tower
but
i
told
him
the
letter
was
in
safe
hands
and
would
remain
there
in
earnest
of
his
good
behaviour
and
that
did
he
have
me
arrested
it
would
instantly
be
laid
before
the
king
and
bring
his
own
head
to
the
block
more
surely
even
than
my
own
it
frightened
him
but
it
had
scarcely
done
so
sweet
had
he
known
that
that
precious
letter
was
still
in
my
boot
for
my
boot
was
on
my
leg
and
my
leg
was
in
the
room
with
the
rest
of
me
he
surrendered
at
last
and
gave
me
papers
proving
that
trenchard
and
i
for
i
stipulated
for
old
nick
safety
too
were
his
accredited
agents
in
the
west
i
loathed
the
title
but
he
spread
his
hands
and
smiled
it
was
that
or
widowing
she
took
his
face
in
her
hands
and
stroked
it
fondly
and
they
sat
thus
until
a
dry
cough
behind
them
roused
them
from
their
joyous
silence
trenchard
was
sauntering
towards
them
his
left
eye
tucked
farther
under
his
hat
than
usual
his
hands
behind
him
is
a
thirsty
evening
he
informed
them
go
tell
richard
so
said
wilding
who
knew
naught
of
altered
ways
i
thought
of
it
but
haply
he
sensitive
on
the
score
of
drinking
with
me
again
he
has
done
it
twice
to
his
he
do
it
a
third
time
no
doubt
said
wilding
curtly
and
trenchard
taking
the
hint
turned
with
a
shrug
and
went
up
the
lawn
towards
the
house
he
found
richard
in
the
porch
where
he
had
lingered
fearfully
waiting
for
news
at
sight
of
trenchard
grim
countenance
he
came
forward
suddenly
how
has
it
sped
he
asked
his
lips
twitching
on
the
words
yonder
they
sit
said
trenchard
pointing
down
the
lawn
no
no
i
mean
sir
oh
sir
rowland
cried
the
old
sinner
as
though
sir
rowland
were
some
matter
long
forgotten
he
sighed
alas
poor
swiney
i
fear
cheated
you
mean
art
slow
at
inference
dick
sir
rowland
has
passed
away
in
the
odour
of
richard
clasped
nervous
hands
together
and
raised
his
colourless
eyes
to
heaven
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
his
soul
said
he
may
he
indeed
said
trenchard
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
but
he
added
pessimistically
i
doubt
the
rogue
in
richard
eyes
kindled
suddenly
and
he
quoted
from
the
thirtieth
psalm
will
extol
thee
o
lord
for
thou
hast
lifted
me
up
and
hast
not
made
my
foes
to
rejoice
over
me
dumbfounded
wondering
indeed
was
westmacott
mind
unhinged
trenchard
scanned
him
narrowly
richard
caught
the
glance
and
misinterpreted
it
for
one
of
reproof
he
bethought
him
that
his
joy
was
unrighteous
he
stifled
it
and
forced
his
lips
to
sigh
poor
blake
poor
indeed
quoth
trenchard
and
adapted
a
remembered
line
of
his
days
to
suit
the
case
the
tears
live
in
an
onion
that
shall
water
his
grave
though
perhaps
i
am
forgetting
then
in
a
brisker
tone
come
richard
what
like
is
the
muscadine
you
keep
at
lupton
house
i
have
abjured
all
wine
said
richard
a
plague
you
have
quoth
trenchard
understanding
less
and
less
have
you
turned
mussulman
perchance
no
answered
richard
sternly
trenchard
hesitated
rubbing
his
nose
thoughtfully
hum
said
he
at
length
peace
be
with
you
then
i
leave
you
here
to
bay
the
moon
to
your
heart
content
perhaps
jasper
will
know
where
to
find
me
a
and
with
a
final
suspicious
wondering
look
at
the
whilom
bibber
he
passed
into
the
house
much
exercised
on
the
score
of
the
sanity
of
this
family
into
which
his
friend
anthony
had
married
outside
the
twilight
shadows
were
deepening
shall
we
home
sweet
whispered
wilding
the
shadows
befriended
her
a
veil
for
her
sudden
confusion
she
breathed
something
that
seemed
no
more
than
a
sigh
though
more
it
seemed
to
anthony
wilding
