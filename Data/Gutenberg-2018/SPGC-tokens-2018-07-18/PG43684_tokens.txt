appendix
introduction
i
is
the
earliest
work
of
alexander
william
kinglake
best
known
as
the
historian
of
the
crimean
war
it
is
an
account
of
a
rather
of
selected
adventures
which
occurred
during
a
in
the
levant
in
but
was
not
published
until
ten
years
later
the
biographical
notices
of
the
author
are
somewhat
meagre
as
by
his
dying
directions
all
his
papers
were
destroyed
he
was
born
near
taunton
in
and
educated
at
eton
and
trinity
college
cambridge
at
which
latter
he
is
said
to
have
been
the
friend
of
thackeray
and
tennyson
on
leaving
college
he
started
on
his
oriental
tour
with
lord
pollington
the
methley
of
and
on
returning
to
england
was
called
to
the
bar
at
lincoln
s
inn
and
obtained
a
lucrative
practice
but
the
life
was
too
tame
to
suit
his
taste
in
he
visited
algeria
and
went
through
a
campaign
with
the
flying
column
of
arnaud
and
in
went
to
the
crimea
with
lord
raglan
and
was
present
at
the
battle
of
alma
on
returning
to
england
he
decided
to
go
into
politics
and
was
elected
for
bridgewater
in
in
the
liberal
interest
he
seems
to
have
been
a
poor
speaker
and
to
have
exercised
little
parliamentary
influence
but
we
are
told
that
in
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
conspiracy
bill
which
was
introduced
after
orsini
s
attempt
to
murder
napoleon
and
that
in
he
denounced
the
cession
of
nice
and
savoy
to
france
in
both
cases
he
was
apparently
actuated
by
his
personal
dislike
of
napoleon
which
is
evident
in
his
historical
works
in
he
was
again
returned
for
bridgewater
but
unseated
on
petition
for
bribery
one
might
have
supposed
that
he
had
acquired
this
habit
in
the
east
but
his
biographers
assert
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
irregularities
which
were
committed
by
his
agents
but
the
chief
business
of
his
later
life
was
the
composition
of
the
of
the
war
in
the
of
which
the
first
two
volumes
appeared
in
and
the
seventh
and
eighth
completing
the
work
in
he
died
in
ii
his
earlier
and
less
ambitious
though
perhaps
more
charming
book
was
rejected
by
several
publishers
but
proved
an
immense
success
it
caught
the
popular
fancy
at
once
and
after
the
lapse
of
more
than
fifty
years
still
maintains
an
honourable
position
in
the
year
after
its
first
appearance
it
passed
through
three
editions
containing
several
variations
from
the
which
have
attracted
the
attention
of
those
who
are
interested
in
bibliography
it
is
only
fair
to
reprint
the
book
with
these
corrections
which
seem
mostly
due
to
the
author
s
laudable
desire
for
greater
accuracy
for
instance
he
was
apparently
seized
with
qualms
as
to
his
assertion
end
of
chap
xiii
that
when
he
emerged
from
the
dead
sea
after
bathing
therein
his
skin
was
thickly
encrusted
with
sulphate
of
magnesia
and
cautiously
substituted
salts
for
the
more
chemical
expression
yet
i
observe
that
the
most
recent
encyclopædia
states
that
the
water
of
the
dead
sea
is
characterised
by
the
presence
of
a
large
quantity
of
magnesian
salts
so
perhaps
his
first
statement
was
not
so
wrong
after
all
he
also
found
that
he
had
talked
of
jove
when
he
should
have
said
neptune
in
his
account
of
the
troad
and
conceiving
a
mistrust
of
the
former
deity
removed
his
name
not
only
from
this
passage
but
also
from
chap
in
which
he
altered
that
touch
was
worthy
of
jove
into
in
that
touch
was
true
i
confess
that
i
think
this
regard
for
truth
might
have
moved
him
to
expunge
his
account
of
the
advances
made
to
him
by
the
young
ladies
of
bethlehem
end
of
chap
xvi
i
can
not
believe
that
narrative
to
be
even
probable
but
anyone
may
retort
that
my
scepticism
is
due
to
the
absence
of
those
attractive
qualities
which
kinglake
possessed
in
chap
xvi
he
says
that
shrouds
are
dipped
in
the
holy
water
of
the
jordan
and
preserved
as
a
burial
dress
which
shall
inure
later
editions
enure
for
salvation
in
the
realms
of
some
critical
scholar
of
eminence
should
be
called
upon
to
emend
or
explain
this
mysterious
passage
at
least
if
people
are
allowed
to
print
such
things
in
the
nineteenth
century
what
right
have
we
to
emend
the
classical
authors
when
they
choose
to
be
unintelligible
the
truth
is
that
despite
its
great
literary
merits
is
often
comfortably
slipshod
and
very
properly
so
for
if
there
is
to
be
any
correspondence
between
subject
and
style
it
must
be
inappropriate
for
a
traveller
recounting
confidentially
his
diversions
and
mishaps
to
adopt
the
phraseology
of
gibbon
matthew
arnold
in
his
essay
on
the
literary
influence
of
academies
selected
the
of
the
crimean
as
an
example
of
what
he
called
the
corinthian
style
certainly
presents
specimens
of
this
manner
but
they
are
hardly
characteristic
it
is
often
urbane
and
has
the
warm
glow
blithe
movement
and
pliancy
of
life
which
according
to
the
critic
s
definition
corinthians
lack
it
is
not
devoid
of
unity
but
it
is
many
sided
and
kaleidoscopic
the
author
varies
from
the
trivial
to
the
solemn
from
boisterous
exuberance
to
careful
austerity
from
flippancy
to
rhapsody
and
is
perhaps
never
quite
serious
one
wonders
whether
one
is
reading
a
clever
but
somewhat
slangy
letter
or
a
essay
polished
and
repolished
by
incessant
perhaps
between
and
he
worked
up
and
rearranged
old
spontaneous
effusions
as
indeed
his
preface
suggests
he
often
writes
like
a
schoolboy
and
sometimes
like
a
philosopher
he
is
at
his
best
when
he
records
what
he
has
seen
in
phrases
not
without
rhetoric
and
not
without
humour
but
distinct
and
clear
as
his
own
impressions
the
foot
falls
noiseless
in
the
crumbling
soil
of
an
eastern
city
and
silence
follows
you
still
again
and
again
you
meet
turbans
and
faces
of
men
but
they
have
nothing
for
look
upon
you
as
we
do
upon
a
december
s
fall
of
a
seasonable
unaccountable
uncomfortable
work
of
god
that
may
have
been
sent
for
some
good
purpose
to
be
revealed
how
vivid
and
how
true
but
perhaps
the
reader
may
ask
as
i
ask
myself
whether
an
introduction
to
is
really
necessary
the
book
is
so
simple
and
complete
in
itself
that
it
seems
to
require
no
explanation
or
commentary
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
acquainted
with
the
levant
of
it
is
well
to
explain
that
the
years
which
have
elapsed
since
kinglake
made
his
eastern
tour
have
brought
about
important
changes
in
the
extent
and
some
few
in
the
condition
of
the
turkish
empire
the
unchanging
east
is
a
popular
phrase
which
is
only
true
in
a
very
limited
sense
it
has
arisen
chiefly
from
the
habit
of
pious
publishers
of
representing
abraham
in
the
costume
of
a
modern
bedouin
sheikh
and
it
is
peculiarly
audacious
to
apply
it
to
regions
like
constantinople
and
egypt
which
have
witnessed
exceptional
vicissitudes
and
undergone
remarkable
changes
religious
and
linguistic
it
is
however
just
to
say
that
the
turk
is
unchanging
it
is
to
the
presence
of
the
turk
that
are
due
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
levant
as
the
region
visited
by
kinglake
may
conveniently
be
termed
like
the
bourbons
he
forgets
nothing
and
learns
nothing
as
he
was
on
the
day
when
he
entered
europe
so
he
was
in
and
so
he
is
now
the
boundaries
of
turkey
have
changed
there
are
now
no
pashas
at
belgrade
or
even
at
sofia
and
ottoman
territory
is
no
longer
but
whenever
one
crosses
the
turkish
frontier
one
may
find
functionaries
like
the
delightful
potentate
of
karagholookoldour
and
be
conscious
of
effecting
within
the
space
of
a
few
hundred
yards
a
change
greater
than
can
be
experienced
in
any
amount
of
travel
in
other
european
countries
including
russia
one
passes
from
regions
where
people
have
roughly
the
same
habits
and
ideas
as
they
believe
in
political
economy
get
drunk
in
public
sit
upon
chairs
and
do
not
feel
there
is
anything
indelicate
in
mentioning
their
a
land
where
people
do
none
of
these
things
where
the
naked
desolation
of
the
country
at
the
side
of
the
railway
offers
a
startling
contrast
to
the
smug
prosperity
of
the
balkan
states
where
people
prefer
to
sit
curled
up
on
hard
sofas
and
where
it
is
bad
taste
to
condole
with
a
man
on
his
wife
s
death
in
the
year
of
kinglake
s
journey
turkey
in
europe
was
considerably
more
extensive
than
at
the
present
day
greece
had
already
revolted
and
been
recognised
as
an
independent
state
wallachia
and
moldavia
were
in
process
of
securing
their
freedom
but
the
territories
now
known
as
bulgaria
bosnia
and
herzegovina
were
still
integral
portions
of
the
ottoman
empire
and
though
servia
in
which
the
scene
of
the
opening
chapters
of
is
laid
had
been
constituted
a
principality
under
milosh
obrenovich
as
prince
in
several
of
the
fortresses
were
still
garrisoned
by
ottoman
troops
which
accounts
for
the
presence
of
the
pasha
at
belgrade
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
though
our
author
must
have
proceeded
to
adrianople
straight
across
bulgaria
he
never
mentions
the
name
of
that
country
this
apparently
strange
omission
is
really
quite
natural
the
bulgarians
though
in
some
ways
the
most
vigorous
element
among
the
balkan
races
passed
through
greater
trials
than
the
servians
or
roumanians
and
for
a
time
lost
their
national
consciousness
more
completely
they
were
nearer
constantinople
and
therefore
any
political
movement
was
more
easily
kept
in
check
while
all
the
religious
and
educational
establishments
of
the
country
were
in
the
hands
of
greek
priests
who
practically
proscribed
the
bulgarian
language
i
have
been
informed
by
a
gentleman
who
has
resided
forty
years
in
turkey
that
when
he
first
entered
the
ottoman
dominions
every
educated
bulgarian
called
himself
a
greek
and
would
have
been
ashamed
to
employ
his
national
designation
which
was
hardly
in
general
use
before
the
movement
of
another
striking
omission
of
is
that
it
contains
hardly
any
allusion
to
the
sultan
at
the
present
day
the
descendant
of
osman
who
claims
to
be
also
the
successor
of
the
prophet
is
a
figure
to
the
british
public
the
mall
familiarly
calls
him
the
xiv
the
friends
of
the
armenians
hold
him
personally
responsible
for
the
massacres
and
a
modern
kinglake
even
if
bent
on
avoiding
political
disquisitions
would
certainly
describe
the
selamlik
or
weekly
visit
of
the
sovereign
to
the
mosque
you
can
not
travel
in
turkey
without
hearing
the
name
of
our
master
effendimiz
or
the
imperial
person
daily
mentioned
and
feeling
that
his
wishes
which
usually
do
not
coincide
with
those
of
european
travellers
and
affect
the
minutest
details
are
the
only
real
power
in
the
country
this
state
of
things
is
due
almost
entirely
to
the
personal
energy
of
the
present
occupant
of
the
ottoman
throne
who
for
good
or
evil
has
succeeded
in
concentrating
all
power
into
his
hands
and
in
displaying
the
greatest
example
of
practical
autocracy
ever
seen
in
mahmoud
was
sultan
one
of
the
most
vigorous
of
ottoman
princes
but
then
near
his
end
and
doubtless
wearied
out
by
a
reign
of
constant
reverse
and
ineffectual
efforts
at
reform
the
armenian
question
like
the
bulgarian
is
of
recent
date
and
we
consequently
find
that
kinglake
says
as
little
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
but
he
often
speaks
of
the
doings
of
mehemet
ali
and
his
son
ibrahim
pasha
which
at
this
period
formed
one
of
the
chief
preoccupations
of
the
porte
mehemet
ali
was
a
native
of
cavalla
who
held
a
military
command
in
egypt
in
the
troubles
which
succeeded
the
french
occupation
of
that
country
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
head
of
the
popular
party
in
cairo
ousted
the
turkish
governor
and
established
himself
in
his
place
he
was
recognised
by
the
porte
in
and
the
khediviate
was
subsequently
made
hereditary
in
his
family
at
this
time
the
mamluks
or
descendants
of
the
turkish
guard
instituted
by
the
sultans
of
egypt
in
the
thirteenth
century
occupied
a
position
somewhat
similar
to
that
of
the
janissaries
at
constantinople
mehemet
ali
like
sultan
mahmoud
felt
that
this
military
in
rendered
fixed
government
impossible
and
determined
to
consolidate
his
own
rule
by
breaking
the
power
of
the
mamluks
he
did
so
by
inviting
their
leaders
to
a
banquet
at
which
they
were
surprised
and
massacred
the
sultan
in
return
for
his
recognition
of
mehemet
ali
as
ruler
of
egypt
made
use
of
him
during
some
years
to
keep
in
order
various
rebellious
provinces
of
the
empire
he
was
first
ordered
to
quell
the
wahabi
insurrection
in
arabia
and
his
campaign
there
is
alluded
to
in
chap
xviii
these
people
were
a
sort
of
mohammedan
puritans
xvi
who
had
made
themselves
masters
of
the
holy
cities
of
mecca
and
medina
mehemet
ali
sent
against
them
his
son
tosun
who
captured
mecca
in
but
died
and
was
replaced
by
his
younger
brother
ibrahim
pasha
who
is
often
mentioned
in
he
finally
concluded
the
wahabi
war
in
and
is
next
heard
of
fighting
against
greece
which
was
beginning
the
struggle
for
independence
mehemet
ali
was
again
called
upon
to
assist
the
sultan
in
suppressing
rebellion
and
again
sent
his
son
to
represent
him
ibrahim
captured
missolonghi
in
but
was
defeated
in
by
the
united
fleets
at
navarino
under
sir
edward
codrington
and
retired
from
greece
in
return
for
these
services
mehemet
ali
claimed
that
the
pashalik
of
syria
should
be
added
to
his
dominions
the
sultan
refused
the
request
of
his
powerful
vassal
but
the
latter
picked
a
quarrel
with
the
turkish
governor
of
syria
and
sent
ibrahim
to
invade
the
province
ibrahim
not
only
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
damascus
but
defeated
the
turkish
army
at
beilan
and
advanced
into
asia
minor
where
he
routed
a
second
force
sent
against
him
by
the
sultan
near
konia
in
december
the
defeated
turkish
troops
joined
the
egyptians
ibrahim
advanced
victoriously
to
broussa
and
had
constantinople
at
his
mercy
the
sultan
in
his
extremity
called
the
russians
to
his
assistance
the
treaty
of
unkiar
iskelesi
was
concluded
in
ibrahim
was
obliged
to
retire
but
the
pashaliks
of
syria
and
adana
were
given
to
mehemet
ali
and
treated
with
great
rigour
as
mentioned
in
chap
xv
at
the
time
of
kinglake
s
visit
to
egypt
the
plague
seems
to
have
been
the
one
absorbing
preoccupation
of
everyone
in
cairo
and
we
learn
little
from
him
of
the
normal
state
of
the
country
at
this
period
the
most
remarkable
of
his
egyptian
sayings
is
the
prophecy
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
called
the
the
englishman
leaning
far
over
to
hold
his
loved
india
will
plant
a
firm
foot
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
sit
in
the
seats
of
the
to
have
made
this
prediction
at
a
time
when
india
was
still
under
the
company
when
we
had
no
interests
in
africa
or
the
red
sea
before
the
suez
canal
was
a
serious
project
perhaps
before
we
had
occupied
aden
xvii
is
indeed
an
example
of
no
ordinary
political
foresight
such
was
the
political
condition
of
the
lands
which
kinglake
visited
and
of
many
aspects
of
which
he
gives
a
most
living
picture
in
his
diverting
preface
he
disclaims
all
intention
of
being
instructive
of
describing
manners
and
customs
still
less
of
discussing
political
and
social
questions
perhaps
his
narrative
sometimes
reminds
the
reader
of
his
statement
chap
viii
that
a
story
may
be
false
as
a
mere
fact
but
perfectly
true
as
an
illustration
some
great
writers
impart
durability
to
their
work
by
selecting
from
a
mass
of
details
such
traits
as
are
important
and
characteristic
and
passing
lightly
over
what
is
transitory
for
instance
the
main
impression
left
by
thackeray
s
novels
is
not
that
the
life
there
described
is
but
that
it
is
in
essentials
the
life
of
so
too
in
a
reader
acquainted
with
the
east
hardly
notices
anachronisms
judged
as
a
description
of
the
levant
of
it
is
inaccurate
or
rather
inadequate
almost
exclusively
on
account
of
its
omissions
but
the
principal
descriptions
incidents
and
mohammedan
quarter
at
belgrade
the
conversation
between
the
pasha
and
the
dragoman
the
meeting
of
the
two
englishmen
in
the
desert
dimitri
and
if
considered
as
types
as
true
to
nature
as
they
were
sixty
years
ago
and
doubtless
will
be
sixty
years
hence
kinglake
treats
the
levant
in
the
only
way
it
ought
to
be
treated
if
it
is
to
be
those
whom
business
or
philanthropy
oblige
to
devote
to
it
any
real
exertion
sentiment
or
interest
lay
up
for
themselves
nothing
but
disillusion
and
disappointment
for
whether
they
are
fascinated
by
the
picturesque
and
manly
virtues
of
the
moslems
or
roused
to
honourable
indignation
by
the
slaughter
and
oppression
of
their
they
will
find
in
the
end
that
as
lord
salisbury
once
said
they
have
put
their
money
on
the
wrong
horse
in
the
eastern
derby
there
are
no
winning
horses
one
after
another
they
have
all
disappointed
their
backers
the
faults
of
eastern
christendom
brought
about
and
still
keep
up
the
rule
of
the
turk
and
few
who
have
an
adequate
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
case
believe
either
that
the
christians
are
happy
under
that
rule
or
that
they
furnish
in
themselves
the
elements
of
anything
much
better
yet
this
dreary
daily
round
of
oppression
and
misgovernment
varied
by
outbursts
of
interracial
a
brighter
side
to
the
mere
spectator
to
the
intelligent
traveller
with
literary
taste
and
a
sense
of
humour
the
surface
of
levantine
life
is
a
stream
of
perpetual
amusement
often
broadening
into
comedy
and
sometimes
bursting
all
bounds
and
breaking
into
a
screaming
farce
the
number
and
variety
of
races
and
languages
afford
infinite
possibilities
of
misunderstanding
and
mistranslation
which
it
must
be
admitted
are
the
basis
of
many
good
stories
the
orientalised
european
and
the
europeanised
oriental
are
alike
inexpressibly
droll
their
very
crimes
have
an
element
of
the
burlesque
which
seems
to
disarm
censure
and
remove
the
whole
transaction
to
a
sphere
where
ordinary
rules
of
right
and
wrong
do
not
apply
the
turk
if
not
precisely
witty
himself
is
at
least
the
cause
of
wit
in
others
extreme
asiatic
dignity
amidst
ludicrously
undignified
european
surroundings
a
mixture
of
pomp
and
homeliness
power
and
childishness
give
rise
to
humorous
anecdotes
of
a
peculiar
and
very
characteristic
flavour
examples
of
which
may
be
found
in
several
works
besides
notably
robert
curzon
s
of
the
another
excellent
illustration
is
supplied
by
vazoff
s
the
a
translation
of
which
has
been
published
in
english
it
is
an
historical
novel
written
by
a
bulgarian
burning
with
indignation
against
the
ottoman
rule
yet
the
turkish
caimmakam
as
drawn
by
a
bitter
enemy
is
no
bloody
tyrant
but
an
exquisitely
diverting
old
gentleman
whose
every
appearance
is
hailed
by
the
reader
with
impatient
delight
as
the
violence
of
the
turk
so
also
the
dishonesty
and
corruption
of
the
rayah
seem
to
lose
their
enormity
when
viewed
in
this
gentle
humorous
light
the
swindling
is
so
palpable
and
yet
so
gravely
decorous
in
its
external
forms
that
it
ceases
to
shock
it
is
so
universal
that
in
the
end
no
one
seems
to
have
suffered
much
wrong
to
vary
the
celebrated
remark
about
the
scilly
islanders
one
may
say
that
these
people
gain
a
precarious
livelihood
by
taking
bribes
from
one
another
again
the
elaborate
and
ceremonious
phraseology
essential
to
all
literary
composition
in
the
east
enables
a
writer
to
make
intrinsically
preposterous
assertions
with
a
gravity
which
renders
criticism
impossible
what
reply
can
be
given
to
the
officials
who
assert
that
armenians
commit
suicide
in
order
to
throw
suspicion
on
certain
excellent
kurds
residing
in
their
neighbourhood
or
who
when
called
upon
to
explain
why
they
have
incarcerated
a
foreign
traveller
under
circumstances
of
extreme
indignity
blandly
reply
that
the
said
gentleman
was
indeed
hospitably
entertained
in
the
government
buildings
this
last
instance
shows
that
oriental
travelling
must
not
be
undertaken
without
due
precautions
a
certain
retinue
and
sufficient
influence
to
secure
the
courtesy
of
the
authorities
which
kinglake
evidently
had
are
essential
with
them
the
traveller
acquires
a
feeling
often
manifest
in
that
he
is
a
sultan
possessed
of
absolute
authority
over
his
surroundings
there
is
just
enough
hardship
to
make
comparative
comfort
seem
luxury
just
enough
danger
to
make
it
pleasant
when
all
is
over
to
hear
from
what
perils
one
has
escaped
should
however
any
reader
be
inclined
to
use
as
a
practical
manual
he
must
be
cautious
in
following
some
of
its
precepts
kinglake
constantly
insists
that
intimidation
haughtiness
and
defiance
of
all
regulations
are
the
only
means
of
impressing
orientals
and
chronicles
with
great
satisfaction
his
own
exploits
in
this
line
concluding
with
the
surprise
of
what
he
says
is
true
enough
as
long
as
the
oriental
believes
that
the
traveller
is
a
prince
in
his
own
country
and
that
any
interference
with
his
mad
whims
will
bring
severe
punishment
but
unfortunately
the
secret
is
out
enlightened
officials
are
well
aware
that
many
englishmen
are
not
cousins
of
the
queen
and
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
hindrances
placed
in
the
way
of
the
prying
european
are
not
displeasing
to
the
imperial
government
the
lord
of
london
who
fifty
years
ago
obtained
a
firman
which
made
every
provincial
official
bow
before
him
may
now
be
kept
waiting
days
or
weeks
for
a
travelling
passport
and
unless
he
uses
tact
as
well
as
bumptiousness
may
find
himself
in
a
position
to
write
to
the
about
the
interior
of
turkish
provincial
prisons
and
become
the
subject
of
a
blue
book
still
even
now
if
travellers
will
be
cautious
and
polite
in
dealing
with
people
of
whose
language
and
customs
they
are
profoundly
ignorant
and
not
bluster
unless
they
know
very
well
what
they
are
about
for
i
admit
that
bluster
has
its
uses
they
will
find
travelling
more
interesting
diverting
and
enjoyable
in
the
levant
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
i
write
these
lines
as
i
sit
in
the
hall
of
the
largest
hotel
in
new
york
a
newly
arrived
stranger
somewhat
dazed
by
the
bustle
and
the
glare
the
whole
establishment
is
on
a
greater
scale
than
anything
else
in
the
its
own
bills
everything
is
made
of
gold
and
marble
including
i
fancy
the
least
this
hypothesis
plausibly
reconciles
the
quality
and
texture
of
the
viands
with
the
value
the
vendors
seem
to
attach
to
them
enormous
lifts
shoot
their
living
freights
up
into
spheres
unseen
or
engulf
them
in
abysmal
chasms
all
round
people
are
ringing
electric
bells
telephoning
telegraphing
stenographing
polygraphing
and
generally
communicating
their
ideas
about
money
to
their
by
any
means
rather
than
the
voice
which
god
put
in
the
larynx
for
the
purpose
of
quiet
conversation
on
one
side
an
operatic
concert
is
being
performed
on
the
other
porters
and
luggage
jostle
a
brilliant
throng
of
fashionably
dressed
people
it
is
as
if
someone
had
given
an
evening
party
at
a
railway
station
whirr
whirr
all
by
wheels
whizz
whizz
all
by
steam
and
electricity
as
the
immortal
pasha
of
karagholookoldour
would
have
said
now
my
mind
like
the
pasha
s
comprehends
locomotives
and
i
am
an
enthusiast
for
progress
but
amidst
all
the
whizz
and
whirr
and
ringing
of
electric
bells
my
memory
turns
somewhat
regretfully
to
a
hotel
where
i
resided
not
long
ago
in
the
exalted
country
fine
old
stamboul
s
jargon
is
so
much
more
soothing
to
the
tongue
than
the
strange
abbreviations
and
initials
they
use
over
was
certainly
more
interesting
and
not
i
think
more
uncomfortable
than
this
transatlantic
caravanserai
perhaps
i
shall
write
an
introduction
congenial
to
the
shade
of
kinglake
if
indeed
the
shades
are
interested
in
new
editions
of
their
works
if
instead
of
instituting
a
comparison
between
the
levant
of
and
of
i
recount
a
journey
to
the
town
of
karakeui
in
the
year
of
grace
and
describe
the
local
hotel
let
not
the
reader
in
pursuit
of
that
sound
learning
which
kinglake
kept
at
arm
s
length
rashly
identify
karakeui
with
the
first
town
he
finds
on
the
map
bearing
that
name
the
turk
has
not
a
great
variety
of
local
designations
when
possible
he
adopts
one
from
some
other
language
treating
it
with
the
scant
courtesy
which
infidel
polysyllables
deserve
edirné
fílibé
for
adrianople
and
phílippopoli
but
when
forced
to
have
recourse
to
his
own
invention
he
calls
most
places
karakeui
or
blacktown
except
those
which
are
dubbed
oldtown
newtown
or
whitetown
it
has
been
justly
said
that
the
east
begins
on
the
other
side
of
vienna
but
out
of
deference
to
the
susceptibilities
of
the
magyars
who
consider
themselves
in
the
van
of
civilisation
the
orient
express
affects
to
be
extremely
european
during
its
transit
through
hungary
it
bustles
and
shakes
and
is
very
uncomfortable
in
servia
it
is
more
at
its
ease
though
it
still
makes
a
pretence
of
thinking
that
time
is
money
by
only
stopping
ten
minutes
at
every
station
in
bulgaria
it
ceases
to
imitate
western
ways
and
becomes
frankly
oriental
reposing
for
half
an
hour
at
spots
where
there
are
no
passengers
and
no
traffic
the
part
of
the
journey
which
lies
on
turkish
territory
follows
a
singularly
tortuous
and
corkscrew
course
across
a
perfectly
level
plain
which
presents
no
obvious
engineering
difficulties
the
porte
confided
the
construction
of
this
line
to
an
eminent
israelite
at
a
remuneration
of
so
much
for
every
kilometre
built
the
eminent
israelite
was
straightway
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
his
ancestors
and
made
a
large
fortune
by
laying
the
rails
along
a
road
as
lengthy
and
complicated
as
that
selected
by
moses
when
he
spent
forty
years
in
traversing
a
distance
which
anyone
else
can
accomplish
in
a
few
days
on
arriving
in
turkey
we
are
at
once
seized
by
the
representatives
of
the
board
of
health
after
all
times
have
indeed
changed
since
was
written
instead
of
being
put
in
quarantine
by
europe
turkey
now
puts
europe
in
quarantine
it
is
true
that
good
moslems
still
hold
that
men
s
souls
leave
their
bodies
when
god
calls
them
and
count
it
impious
to
suppose
that
neglect
or
precaution
can
hasten
or
delay
the
divine
summons
but
though
the
porte
are
not
disposed
to
amend
the
sanitary
condition
of
mecca
they
enforce
quarantine
regulations
all
round
constantinople
with
fanatical
rigour
this
is
due
partly
to
the
fears
of
the
palace
and
partly
i
think
to
a
sense
of
humour
it
is
an
excellent
joke
to
apply
a
parody
of
european
rules
to
europeans
in
the
name
of
sanitary
science
to
keep
a
set
of
fussy
business
people
waiting
a
few
days
because
they
have
come
from
a
country
which
has
not
imposed
quarantine
on
another
country
where
there
has
been
a
doubtful
case
of
cholera
or
to
detain
a
ship
with
a
valuable
cargo
while
embassies
and
merchants
scream
that
thousands
of
pounds
are
being
lost
daily
on
the
present
occasion
we
are
told
we
must
wait
a
day
under
inspection
to
see
if
we
develop
the
symptoms
of
any
terrible
malady
and
are
accordingly
lodged
in
damp
little
wooden
huts
on
a
muddy
plain
where
we
are
certainly
likely
to
fall
ill
even
if
hale
and
hearty
on
arriving
turkish
soldiers
prevent
us
from
crossing
an
imaginary
line
and
contaminating
the
surrounding
desert
the
quarantine
doctor
however
explains
to
me
that
he
has
a
peculiar
respect
for
my
character
sanitary
and
general
and
would
like
to
take
a
walk
with
me
outside
the
limits
of
the
establishment
he
has
a
remarkable
pedigree
his
father
was
a
bohemian
monk
who
found
convent
life
too
narrow
for
his
taste
and
accordingly
embraced
islam
once
within
the
true
fold
he
made
up
for
lost
time
by
marrying
as
many
wives
as
his
new
liberty
allowed
and
this
is
one
of
the
results
he
confides
to
me
that
his
one
ambition
is
to
wear
decorations
and
that
in
return
for
his
civilities
strangers
of
distinction
have
procured
for
him
the
orders
of
their
respective
countries
the
siamese
minister
who
recently
passed
through
made
him
a
commander
of
the
order
of
the
white
elephant
could
i
not
obtain
for
him
the
order
of
the
garter
doubtless
i
possess
it
myself
with
blushing
mendacity
i
lead
him
to
believe
that
i
do
but
explain
that
the
distinction
is
only
given
to
englishmen
and
not
to
foreigners
i
see
that
he
does
not
believe
me
and
meditates
revenge
before
we
leave
the
quarantine
station
we
have
to
be
disinfected
the
doctor
attaches
a
garden
hose
to
a
reservoir
filled
with
a
fetid
and
corrosive
fluid
the
victims
are
led
up
one
by
one
by
the
military
authorities
as
if
to
execution
and
the
jet
is
turned
upon
them
causing
their
garments
to
burst
out
into
leprous
spots
i
see
by
the
doctor
s
eye
that
he
means
to
make
me
pay
for
my
unfriendliness
in
the
matter
of
the
decoration
and
therefore
casting
scruple
to
the
winds
i
assure
him
that
if
he
will
only
treat
me
gently
he
shall
have
the
fourth
class
of
the
garter
he
is
at
once
all
civility
and
consideration
and
when
i
am
led
up
in
front
of
his
infernal
machine
directs
an
odoriferous
douche
to
the
right
and
left
leaving
me
unwetted
in
the
middle
truly
the
way
into
turkey
is
beset
with
as
many
difficulties
as
the
road
to
paradise
after
the
quarantine
comes
the
custom
house
the
entry
of
most
things
is
absolutely
prohibited
and
those
which
do
enter
pay
a
high
duty
books
are
treated
with
incredible
severity
no
work
is
allowed
to
pass
the
frontier
which
hints
that
the
turks
were
ever
defeated
or
that
the
ottoman
government
or
the
mohammedan
religion
have
any
imperfections
turkish
officials
having
found
by
experience
that
very
little
european
literature
comes
up
to
their
high
standard
simply
confiscate
as
seditious
every
publication
which
mentions
turkey
or
the
mohammedan
east
even
without
the
present
highly
seditious
preface
is
placed
on
the
index
as
are
also
shakespeare
byron
dante
the
baedeker
and
murray
in
practice
of
course
certain
familiar
ad
modify
this
draconian
system
but
even
the
golden
key
sometimes
fails
to
open
the
door
the
officials
watch
one
another
and
know
that
they
are
much
more
likely
to
obtain
a
turkish
decoration
by
confiscating
some
infamous
historian
who
is
not
ashamed
to
say
that
the
turks
were
once
driven
out
of
hungary
than
they
are
to
receive
the
garter
for
letting
his
calumnies
in
but
there
is
an
end
to
all
troubles
even
on
the
turkish
frontier
and
at
last
we
are
allowed
to
proceed
to
karakeui
where
i
ultimately
alight
at
the
hotel
karakeui
lies
on
a
plateau
under
a
range
of
snowy
mountains
which
glitter
with
strange
distinctness
in
the
pure
translucent
air
a
forest
of
minarets
bears
testimony
to
the
piety
of
the
place
it
is
the
sacred
month
of
ramazan
and
at
sunset
they
will
be
festooned
with
lights
and
blaze
like
columns
of
fire
while
in
the
mosque
below
myriads
of
little
oil
lamps
will
shed
their
soft
glow
on
the
bowing
crowds
the
plashing
fountains
and
the
names
of
saints
and
prophets
blazoned
on
the
walls
in
green
and
red
in
the
streets
is
a
motley
throng
of
men
and
animals
strings
of
camels
and
dogs
sheep
and
turkeys
are
mixed
up
with
the
human
crowd
bulgarians
and
servians
quarrel
in
the
bazaar
and
denounce
one
another
to
the
turks
they
each
claim
exclusive
rights
over
the
only
christian
church
and
the
governor
to
end
the
dispute
has
shut
it
up
altogether
a
few
greeks
are
occupied
in
making
large
fortunes
and
are
ready
to
expatiate
on
the
hellenic
idea
and
to
explain
how
from
a
certain
peculiar
point
of
view
the
late
war
may
be
regarded
as
a
victory
for
greece
albanians
armed
with
many
weapons
and
with
moustaches
as
long
as
their
own
rifles
swagger
through
the
crowd
which
respectfully
makes
way
for
them
the
hotel
is
kept
by
an
armenian
who
left
his
native
village
on
account
of
what
are
beautifully
termed
the
events
which
occurred
there
having
been
inspired
by
these
occurrences
with
a
wholesome
respect
for
the
followers
of
the
prophet
he
is
a
little
apt
to
recoup
himself
at
the
expense
of
his
but
the
local
ottoman
authorities
to
whose
care
i
am
duly
recommended
as
being
one
of
those
who
wish
well
to
the
sublime
government
have
sternly
informed
him
that
i
am
not
to
be
fleeced
i
wonder
if
the
governor
of
new
york
would
address
a
similar
warning
to
the
proprietor
of
this
hotel
the
establishment
is
constructed
in
the
form
of
a
quadrangle
the
central
space
is
a
quagmire
wherein
are
embedded
and
so
to
speak
held
as
hostages
for
payment
the
vehicles
in
which
the
travellers
have
arrived
the
ground
floor
of
the
surrounding
buildings
is
devoted
to
stabling
outside
the
first
floor
and
above
the
aforesaid
quagmire
runs
a
gallery
from
which
open
a
number
of
cells
bare
and
whitewashed
devoid
of
all
furniture
but
contrary
to
what
might
be
expected
scrupulously
clean
a
marble
bath
is
not
as
in
new
york
attached
to
each
apartment
but
in
response
to
a
suitable
shout
a
boy
brings
a
brass
jug
and
basin
pours
water
over
your
hands
and
wipes
them
on
an
embroidered
towel
there
is
no
table
and
no
bed
when
you
are
disposed
to
sleep
a
pile
of
rugs
is
spread
on
the
floor
if
you
want
to
write
you
naturally
sit
on
your
heels
and
hold
your
paper
in
your
attitude
which
at
least
in
the
case
of
europeans
tends
to
restrain
exuberance
and
keep
literary
composition
within
due
limits
at
meal
times
a
little
table
like
a
high
stool
is
brought
in
the
guests
squat
round
it
on
their
heels
and
eat
with
their
fingers
out
of
a
large
saucer
set
on
a
broad
tin
tray
turkish
dinners
consist
of
a
quantity
of
dishes
generally
at
least
seven
or
eight
and
sometimes
as
many
as
twenty
but
each
is
only
tasted
and
rapidly
removed
at
first
it
looks
somewhat
mysterious
when
people
apparently
wrap
up
some
pieces
of
string
in
brown
paper
and
eat
the
parcel
with
avidity
but
the
string
is
cheese
drawn
out
like
very
attenuated
vermicelli
and
the
brown
paper
sheets
of
very
thin
bread
which
serve
as
a
tablecloth
and
napkin
as
well
as
for
food
during
ramazan
no
moslem
may
eat
drink
or
smoke
between
sunrise
and
sunset
the
latter
phenomenon
is
announced
by
a
cannon
and
some
minutes
before
the
gun
fires
a
hungry
crowd
is
gathered
round
the
table
waiting
for
the
blessed
sound
then
follows
half
an
hour
of
rapid
silent
nutrition
for
turks
do
not
talk
at
table
afterwards
an
hour
or
more
of
prayer
and
then
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
until
at
least
twelve
or
one
is
devoted
to
visiting
or
attending
the
puppet
show
called
karagyöz
xxxi
half
an
hour
before
dawn
people
go
round
the
town
beating
drums
and
the
faithful
hurriedly
take
a
last
meal
before
the
morning
cannon
announces
the
dawn
my
neighbour
in
the
room
on
the
right
is
a
spy
appointed
by
the
imperial
government
to
watch
over
my
doings
he
is
a
charming
companion
and
i
fancy
has
a
very
pretty
talent
for
the
composition
of
imaginative
literature
my
only
regret
is
that
i
have
never
seen
the
daily
reports
which
he
draws
up
on
my
conduct
they
are
i
believe
replete
with
incident
and
are
excellent
specimens
of
a
new
and
interesting
variety
of
fiction
the
room
on
my
left
is
occupied
by
the
christian
of
the
province
who
was
appointed
some
months
ago
under
immense
pressure
from
the
powers
met
by
such
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
porte
that
one
might
have
supposed
his
nomination
was
a
deadly
blow
to
the
turkish
empire
it
is
a
wise
plan
of
the
porte
s
never
to
make
the
most
trivial
concession
without
opposing
a
resistance
which
is
often
successful
and
always
seems
to
enhance
the
importance
of
the
point
in
dispute
but
the
concession
once
made
means
are
soon
discovered
to
deprive
it
of
all
its
value
and
the
positions
of
victors
and
vanquished
in
the
game
prove
to
be
reversed
in
the
present
case
the
christian
found
that
none
of
his
were
disposed
to
let
him
lodgings
and
the
local
authorities
with
a
tender
solicitude
for
his
welfare
represented
to
him
that
there
was
a
strong
feeling
against
him
in
the
town
and
that
he
would
be
much
more
comfortable
in
the
hotel
predicting
like
kinglake
s
prophet
damoor
that
if
he
went
out
into
the
streets
or
meddled
in
the
administration
he
would
arouse
that
excitable
sentiment
known
as
mussulman
religious
feeling
like
the
jews
of
safet
the
christian
thought
that
the
predictions
of
such
practical
men
were
not
to
be
disregarded
and
takes
his
ease
in
his
inn
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
can
muster
another
interesting
occupant
of
the
hotel
is
the
turkish
inspector
of
reforms
to
rightly
understand
the
duties
of
this
functionary
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
turkish
government
is
divided
into
two
parts
which
have
no
connection
with
one
another
the
real
government
which
is
hard
to
comprehend
but
of
which
one
gets
a
dim
idea
by
observation
on
the
spot
and
the
show
government
intended
to
impress
europe
and
having
as
chief
practical
result
the
enrichment
of
telegraphic
agencies
two
common
manifestations
of
the
show
government
are
circulars
to
the
powers
and
commissions
despatched
to
the
provinces
to
rectify
abuses
the
present
commissioner
has
come
to
inspect
reforms
and
from
the
official
language
used
respecting
him
it
may
be
supposed
that
his
mission
is
to
tend
and
water
the
new
institutions
which
are
springing
up
like
a
luxuriant
vegetation
in
a
favourable
climate
but
at
the
same
time
to
exercise
a
fatherly
control
prevent
the
country
from
rushing
into
downright
republicanism
and
not
permit
the
christians
to
positively
oppress
their
weaker
mohammedan
brethren
he
is
a
very
affable
man
with
a
broad
smiling
face
and
an
amiable
rotundity
of
person
which
causes
his
gorgeous
uniform
to
burst
its
buttons
and
gape
at
critical
points
he
pays
me
long
visits
for
the
purpose
of
political
discussion
being
as
he
calls
it
à
fait
dans
les
idées
and
in
order
that
this
outpouring
of
radical
views
may
not
be
interrupted
he
brings
a
soldier
to
mount
guard
over
the
door
no
tortures
could
make
me
disclose
the
commissioner
s
confidences
i
will
merely
observe
that
the
long
fasts
of
ramazan
are
irksome
to
an
enlightened
mind
and
that
liberal
theologians
hold
that
a
mixture
of
brandy
and
champagne
does
not
fall
under
the
prophet
s
ban
inasmuch
as
it
can
not
accurately
be
described
as
either
wine
or
spirits
very
different
is
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
no
guard
is
needed
here
the
door
stands
proudly
open
and
all
the
world
may
see
that
no
crumb
of
bread
or
drop
of
water
enters
from
sunrise
to
sunset
in
the
middle
of
a
low
sofa
sits
a
hodja
clad
in
striped
silk
he
is
no
ordinary
country
parson
but
a
noted
preacher
invited
to
tour
in
the
provinces
during
ramazan
and
hold
what
in
other
countries
would
be
called
revival
meetings
his
thin
nervous
face
shows
that
he
is
not
a
real
turk
probably
he
is
of
arab
extraction
and
in
any
case
he
burns
with
a
semitic
indignation
against
those
who
ascribe
companions
to
round
him
sit
in
a
solemn
circle
the
notables
of
the
town
devout
men
of
the
churchwarden
order
who
to
judge
from
the
heavy
sighs
and
puffs
which
they
occasionally
emit
do
not
share
the
hodja
s
fierce
joy
in
trampling
on
the
desires
of
the
flesh
he
will
preach
in
the
great
mosque
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
in
token
that
the
building
was
once
a
christian
church
and
has
been
won
from
the
infidel
i
tell
the
commissioner
for
reforms
that
i
think
this
dangerous
and
injudicious
he
explains
that
the
whole
point
of
the
ceremony
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
sword
is
sheathed
as
a
token
that
religious
discord
is
at
an
end
and
that
an
era
of
mutual
love
and
toleration
has
commenced
but
when
i
think
of
that
nervous
fanatical
face
the
green
garments
the
ample
turban
the
amulets
and
the
sword
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
it
is
better
to
be
a
christian
traveller
than
a
christian
resident
at
karakeui
preface
to
the
first
edition
addressed
by
the
author
to
one
of
his
friends
when
you
first
entertained
the
idea
of
travelling
in
the
east
you
asked
me
to
send
you
an
outline
of
the
tour
which
i
had
made
in
order
that
you
might
the
better
be
able
to
choose
a
route
for
yourself
in
answer
to
this
request
i
gave
you
a
large
french
map
on
which
the
course
of
my
journeys
had
been
carefully
marked
but
i
did
not
conceal
from
myself
that
this
was
rather
a
dry
mode
for
a
man
to
adopt
when
he
wished
to
impart
the
results
of
his
experience
to
a
dear
and
intimate
friend
now
long
before
the
period
of
your
planning
an
oriental
tour
i
had
intended
to
write
some
account
of
my
eastern
travels
i
had
indeed
begun
the
task
and
had
failed
i
had
begun
it
a
second
time
and
failing
again
had
abandoned
my
attempt
with
a
sensation
of
utter
distaste
i
was
unable
to
speak
out
and
chiefly
i
think
for
this
reason
that
i
knew
not
to
whom
i
was
speaking
it
might
be
you
or
perhaps
our
lady
of
bitterness
xxxv
who
would
read
my
story
or
it
might
be
some
member
of
the
royal
statistical
society
and
how
on
earth
was
i
to
write
in
a
way
that
would
do
for
all
three
well
your
request
for
a
sketch
of
my
tour
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
complying
with
your
wish
by
a
revival
of
my
attempt
i
tried
and
the
pleasure
and
confidence
which
i
felt
in
speaking
to
you
soon
made
my
task
so
easy
and
even
amusing
that
after
a
while
though
not
in
time
for
your
tour
i
completed
the
scrawl
from
which
this
book
was
originally
printed
the
very
feeling
however
which
enabled
me
to
write
thus
freely
prevented
me
from
robing
my
thoughts
in
that
grave
and
decorous
style
which
i
should
have
maintained
if
i
had
professed
to
lecture
the
public
whilst
i
feigned
to
myself
that
you
and
you
only
were
listening
i
could
not
by
any
possibility
speak
very
solemnly
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
talk
to
my
own
genial
friend
as
though
he
were
a
great
and
enlightened
community
or
any
other
respectable
aggregate
yet
i
well
understood
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
professing
to
speak
to
you
rather
than
to
the
public
generally
could
not
perfectly
excuse
me
for
printing
a
narrative
too
roughly
worded
and
accordingly
in
revising
the
i
have
struck
out
those
phrases
which
seemed
to
be
less
fit
for
a
published
volume
than
for
intimate
conversation
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
however
that
correction
of
this
kind
should
be
perfectly
complete
or
that
the
almost
boisterous
tone
in
which
many
parts
of
the
book
were
originally
written
should
be
thoroughly
subdued
i
venture
therefore
to
ask
that
the
familiarity
of
language
still
possibly
apparent
in
the
work
may
be
laid
to
the
account
of
our
delightful
intimacy
rather
than
to
any
presumptuous
motive
i
feel
as
you
know
much
too
timidly
too
distantly
and
too
respectfully
toward
the
public
to
be
capable
of
seeking
to
put
myself
on
terms
of
easy
fellowship
with
strange
and
casual
readers
it
is
right
to
forewarn
people
and
i
have
tried
to
do
this
as
well
as
i
can
by
my
studiously
unpromising
xxxvii
that
the
book
is
quite
superficial
in
its
character
i
have
endeavoured
to
discard
from
it
all
valuable
matter
derived
from
the
works
of
others
and
it
appears
to
me
that
my
efforts
in
this
direction
have
been
attended
with
great
success
i
believe
i
may
truly
acknowledge
that
from
all
details
of
geographical
discovery
or
antiquarian
all
display
of
sound
learning
and
religious
knowledge
all
historical
and
scientific
all
useful
all
political
from
all
good
moral
reflections
the
volume
is
thoroughly
free
my
excuse
for
the
book
is
its
truth
you
and
i
know
a
man
fond
of
hazarding
elaborate
jokes
who
whenever
a
story
of
his
happens
not
to
go
down
as
wit
will
evade
the
awkwardness
of
the
failure
by
bravely
maintaining
that
all
he
has
said
is
pure
fact
i
can
honestly
take
this
decent
though
humble
mode
of
escape
my
narrative
is
not
merely
righteously
exact
in
matters
of
fact
where
fact
is
in
question
but
it
is
true
in
this
larger
conveys
not
those
impressions
which
to
have
produced
upon
any
mind
but
those
which
were
really
and
truly
received
at
the
time
of
his
rambles
by
a
headstrong
and
not
very
amiable
traveller
whose
prejudices
in
favour
of
other
people
s
notions
were
then
exceedingly
slight
as
i
have
felt
so
i
have
written
and
the
result
is
that
there
will
often
be
found
in
my
narrative
a
jarring
discord
between
the
associations
properly
belonging
to
interesting
sites
and
the
tone
in
which
i
speak
of
them
this
seemingly
perverse
mode
of
treating
the
subject
is
forced
upon
me
by
my
plan
of
adhering
to
sentimental
truth
and
really
does
not
result
from
any
impertinent
wish
to
tease
or
trifle
with
readers
i
ought
for
instance
to
have
felt
as
strongly
in
judæa
as
in
galilee
but
it
was
not
so
in
fact
the
religious
sentiment
born
in
solitude
which
had
heated
my
brain
in
the
sanctuary
of
nazareth
was
rudely
chilled
at
the
foot
of
zion
by
disenchanting
scenes
and
this
change
is
accordingly
disclosed
by
the
perfectly
worldly
tone
in
which
i
speak
of
jerusalem
and
bethlehem
my
notion
of
dwelling
precisely
upon
those
matters
which
happened
to
interest
me
and
upon
none
other
would
of
course
be
intolerable
in
a
regular
book
of
travels
if
i
had
been
passing
through
countries
not
previously
explored
it
would
have
been
sadly
perverse
to
withhold
careful
descriptions
of
admirable
objects
merely
because
my
own
feelings
of
interest
in
them
may
have
happened
to
flag
but
where
the
countries
which
one
visits
have
been
thoroughly
and
ably
described
and
even
artistically
illustrated
by
others
one
is
fully
at
liberty
to
say
as
little
though
not
quite
so
much
as
one
chooses
now
a
traveller
is
a
creature
not
always
looking
at
sights
he
remembers
how
often
the
happy
land
of
his
birth
he
has
too
his
moments
of
humble
enthusiasm
about
fire
and
food
about
shade
and
drink
and
if
he
gives
to
these
feelings
anything
like
the
prominence
which
really
belonged
to
them
at
the
time
of
his
travelling
he
will
not
seem
a
very
good
teacher
once
having
determined
to
write
the
sheer
truth
concerning
the
things
which
chiefly
have
interested
him
he
must
and
he
will
sing
a
sadly
long
strain
about
self
he
will
talk
for
whole
pages
together
about
his
bivouac
fire
and
ruin
the
ruins
of
baalbec
with
eight
or
ten
cold
lines
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
egotism
of
a
traveller
however
incessant
however
shameless
and
obtrusive
must
still
convey
some
true
ideas
of
the
country
through
which
he
has
passed
his
very
selfishness
his
habit
of
referring
the
whole
external
world
to
his
own
sensations
compels
him
as
it
were
in
his
writings
to
observe
the
laws
of
perspective
tells
you
of
objects
not
as
he
knows
them
to
be
but
as
they
seemed
to
him
the
people
and
the
things
that
most
concern
him
personally
however
mean
and
insignificant
take
large
proportions
in
his
picture
because
they
stand
so
near
to
him
he
shows
you
his
dragoman
and
the
gaunt
features
of
his
tent
his
kneeling
camels
his
baggage
strewed
upon
the
sand
but
the
proper
wonders
of
the
cities
the
mighty
ruins
and
monuments
of
bygone
ages
he
throws
back
faintly
in
the
distance
it
is
thus
that
he
felt
and
thus
he
strives
to
repeat
the
scenes
of
the
elder
world
you
may
listen
to
him
for
ever
without
learning
much
in
the
way
of
statistics
but
perhaps
if
you
bear
with
him
long
enough
you
may
find
yourself
slowly
and
faintly
impressed
with
the
realities
of
eastern
travel
my
scheme
of
refusing
to
dwell
upon
matters
which
failed
to
interest
my
own
feelings
has
been
departed
from
in
one
in
my
detail
of
the
late
lady
hester
stanhope
s
conversation
on
supernatural
topics
the
truth
is
that
i
have
been
much
questioned
on
this
subject
and
i
thought
that
my
best
plan
would
be
to
write
down
at
once
all
that
i
could
ever
have
to
say
concerning
the
personage
whose
career
has
excited
so
much
curiosity
amongst
englishwomen
the
result
is
that
my
account
of
the
lady
goes
to
a
length
which
is
not
justified
either
by
the
importance
of
the
subject
or
by
the
extent
to
which
it
interested
the
narrator
you
will
see
that
i
constantly
speak
of
my
people
my
party
my
arabs
and
so
on
using
terms
which
might
possibly
seem
to
imply
that
i
moved
about
with
a
pompous
retinue
this
of
course
was
not
the
case
i
travelled
with
the
simplicity
proper
to
my
station
as
one
of
the
industrious
class
who
was
not
flying
from
his
country
because
of
ennui
but
was
strengthening
his
will
and
tempering
the
metal
of
his
nature
for
that
life
of
toil
and
conflict
in
which
he
is
now
engaged
but
an
englishman
journeying
in
the
east
must
necessarily
have
with
him
dragomen
capable
of
interpreting
the
oriental
languages
the
absence
of
wheeled
carriages
obliges
him
to
use
several
beasts
of
burthen
for
his
baggage
as
well
as
for
himself
and
his
attendants
the
owners
of
the
horses
or
camels
with
slaves
or
servants
fall
in
as
part
of
his
train
and
altogether
the
cavalcade
becomes
rather
numerous
without
however
occasioning
any
proportionate
increase
of
expense
when
a
traveller
speaks
of
all
these
followers
in
mass
he
calls
them
his
people
or
his
troop
or
his
party
without
intending
to
make
you
believe
that
he
is
therefore
a
sovereign
prince
you
will
see
that
i
sometimes
follow
the
custom
of
the
scots
in
describing
my
by
the
names
of
their
paternal
homes
of
course
all
these
explanations
are
meant
for
casual
readers
to
you
without
one
syllable
of
excuse
or
deprecation
and
in
all
the
confidence
of
a
friendship
that
never
yet
was
clouded
i
give
the
volume
and
add
but
this
one
goodbye
for
i
dare
not
stand
greeting
you
here
chapter
i
over
the
border
at
semlin
i
still
was
encompassed
by
the
scenes
and
the
sounds
of
familiar
life
the
din
of
a
busy
world
still
vexed
and
cheered
me
the
unveiled
faces
of
women
still
shone
in
the
light
of
day
yet
whenever
i
chose
to
look
southward
i
saw
the
ottoman
s
and
darkly
impending
high
over
the
vale
of
the
belgrade
i
had
come
as
it
were
to
the
end
of
this
europe
and
now
my
eyes
would
see
the
splendour
and
havoc
of
the
east
the
two
frontier
towns
are
less
than
a
distant
and
yet
their
people
hold
no
communion
the
hungarian
on
the
north
and
the
turk
and
servian
on
the
southern
side
of
the
save
are
as
much
asunder
as
though
there
were
fifty
broad
provinces
that
lay
in
the
path
between
them
of
the
men
that
bustled
around
me
in
the
streets
of
semlin
there
was
not
perhaps
one
who
had
ever
gone
down
to
look
upon
the
stranger
race
dwelling
under
the
walls
of
that
opposite
castle
it
is
the
plague
and
the
dread
of
the
plague
that
divide
the
one
people
from
the
other
all
coming
and
going
stands
forbidden
by
the
terrors
of
the
yellow
flag
if
you
dare
to
break
the
laws
of
the
quarantine
you
will
be
tried
with
military
haste
the
court
will
scream
out
your
sentence
to
you
from
a
tribunal
some
fifty
yards
off
the
priest
instead
of
gently
whispering
to
you
the
sweet
hopes
of
religion
will
console
you
at
duelling
distance
and
after
that
you
will
find
yourself
carefully
shot
and
carelessly
buried
in
the
ground
of
the
lazaretto
when
all
was
in
order
for
our
departure
we
walked
down
to
the
precincts
of
the
quarantine
establishment
and
here
awaited
us
a
compromised
officer
of
the
austrian
government
who
lives
in
a
state
of
perpetual
excommunication
the
boats
with
their
compromised
rowers
were
also
in
readiness
after
coming
in
contact
with
any
creature
or
thing
belonging
to
the
ottoman
empire
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
return
to
the
austrian
territory
without
undergoing
an
imprisonment
of
fourteen
days
in
the
odious
lazaretto
we
felt
therefore
that
before
we
committed
ourselves
it
was
important
to
take
care
that
none
of
the
arrangements
necessary
for
the
journey
had
been
forgotten
and
in
our
anxiety
to
avoid
such
a
misfortune
we
managed
the
work
of
departure
from
semlin
with
nearly
as
much
solemnity
as
if
we
had
been
departing
this
life
some
obliging
persons
from
whom
we
had
received
civilities
during
our
short
stay
in
the
place
came
down
to
say
their
farewell
at
the
river
s
side
and
now
as
we
stood
with
them
at
the
distance
of
three
or
four
yards
from
the
compromised
officer
they
asked
if
we
were
perfectly
certain
that
we
had
wound
up
all
our
affairs
in
christendom
and
whether
we
had
no
parting
requests
to
make
we
repeated
the
caution
to
our
servants
and
took
anxious
thought
lest
by
any
possibility
we
might
be
cut
off
from
some
cherished
object
of
affection
they
quite
sure
that
nothing
had
been
there
was
no
fragrant
with
its
letters
of
credit
from
which
we
might
be
parting
for
ever
all
our
treasures
lay
safely
stowed
in
the
boat
and
we
were
ready
to
follow
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
now
therefore
we
shook
hands
with
our
semlin
friends
who
immediately
retreated
for
three
or
four
paces
so
as
to
leave
us
in
the
centre
of
a
space
between
them
and
the
compromised
officer
the
latter
then
advanced
and
asking
once
more
if
we
had
done
with
the
civilised
world
held
forth
his
hand
i
met
it
with
mine
and
there
was
an
end
to
christendom
for
many
a
day
to
come
we
soon
neared
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
but
no
sounds
came
down
from
the
blank
walls
above
and
there
was
no
living
thing
that
we
could
yet
see
except
one
great
hovering
bird
of
the
vulture
race
flying
low
and
intent
and
wheeling
round
and
round
over
the
city
but
presently
there
issued
from
the
postern
a
group
of
human
with
immortal
souls
and
possibly
some
reasoning
faculties
but
to
me
the
grand
point
was
this
that
they
had
real
substantial
and
incontrovertible
turbans
they
made
for
the
point
towards
which
we
were
steering
and
when
at
last
i
sprang
upon
the
shore
i
heard
and
saw
myself
now
first
surrounded
by
men
of
asiatic
blood
i
have
since
ridden
through
the
land
of
the
osmanlees
from
the
servian
border
to
the
golden
the
gulf
of
satalieh
to
the
tomb
of
achilles
but
never
have
i
seen
such
looking
fellows
as
those
who
received
me
on
the
banks
of
the
save
they
were
men
in
the
humblest
order
of
life
having
come
to
meet
our
boat
in
the
hope
of
earning
something
by
carrying
our
luggage
up
to
the
city
but
poor
though
they
were
it
was
plain
that
they
were
turks
of
the
proud
old
school
and
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
fierce
careless
bearing
of
their
once
victorious
race
though
the
province
of
servia
generally
has
obtained
a
kind
of
independence
yet
belgrade
as
being
a
place
of
strength
on
the
frontier
is
still
garrisoned
by
turkish
troops
under
the
command
of
a
pasha
whether
the
fellows
who
now
surrounded
us
were
soldiers
or
peaceful
inhabitants
i
did
not
understand
they
wore
the
old
turkish
costume
vests
and
jackets
of
many
and
brilliant
colours
divided
from
the
loose
by
heavy
volumes
of
shawl
so
thickly
folded
around
their
waists
as
to
give
the
meagre
wearers
something
of
the
dignity
of
true
corpulence
this
cincture
enclosed
a
whole
bundle
of
weapons
no
man
bore
less
than
one
brace
of
immensely
long
pistols
and
a
yataghan
or
cutlass
with
a
dagger
or
two
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
most
of
these
arms
were
inlaid
with
silver
and
highly
burnished
so
that
they
contrasted
shiningly
with
the
decayed
grandeur
of
the
garments
to
which
they
were
attached
this
carefulness
of
his
arms
is
a
point
of
honour
with
the
osmanlee
who
never
allows
his
bright
yataghan
to
suffer
from
his
own
adversity
then
the
long
drooping
mustachios
and
the
ample
folds
of
the
once
white
turbans
that
lowered
over
the
piercing
eyes
and
the
haggard
features
of
the
men
gave
them
an
air
of
gloomy
pride
and
that
appearance
of
trying
to
be
disdainful
under
difficulties
which
i
have
since
seen
so
often
in
those
of
the
ottoman
people
who
live
and
remember
old
times
they
seemed
as
if
they
were
thinking
that
they
would
have
been
more
usefully
more
honourably
and
more
piously
employed
in
cutting
our
throats
than
in
carrying
our
portmanteaus
the
faithful
steel
methley
s
yorkshire
servant
stood
aghast
for
a
moment
at
the
sight
of
his
master
s
luggage
upon
the
shoulders
of
these
warlike
porters
and
when
at
last
we
began
to
move
up
he
could
scarcely
avoid
turning
round
to
cast
one
affectionate
look
towards
christendom
but
quickly
again
he
marched
on
with
steps
of
a
man
not
frightened
exactly
but
sternly
prepared
for
death
or
the
koran
or
even
for
plural
wives
the
moslem
quarter
of
a
city
is
lonely
and
desolate
you
go
up
and
down
and
on
over
shelving
and
hillocky
paths
through
the
narrow
lanes
walled
in
by
blank
windowless
dwellings
you
come
out
upon
an
open
space
strewed
with
the
black
ruins
that
some
late
fire
has
left
you
pass
by
a
mountain
of
castaway
things
the
rubbish
of
centuries
and
on
it
you
see
numbers
of
big
wolflike
dogs
lying
torpid
under
the
sun
with
limbs
to
the
full
as
if
they
were
dead
storks
or
cranes
sitting
fearless
upon
the
low
roofs
look
gravely
down
upon
you
the
still
air
that
you
breathe
is
loaded
with
the
scent
of
citron
and
pomegranate
rinds
scorched
by
the
sun
or
as
you
approach
the
bazaar
with
the
dry
dead
perfume
of
strange
spices
you
long
for
some
signs
of
life
and
tread
the
ground
more
heavily
as
though
you
would
wake
the
sleepers
with
the
heel
of
your
boot
but
the
foot
falls
noiseless
upon
the
crumbling
soil
of
an
eastern
city
and
silence
follows
you
still
again
and
again
you
meet
turbans
and
faces
of
men
but
they
have
nothing
for
look
upon
you
as
we
do
upon
a
december
s
fall
of
a
seasonable
unaccountable
uncomfortable
work
of
god
that
may
have
been
sent
for
some
good
purpose
to
be
revealed
hereafter
some
people
had
come
down
to
meet
us
with
an
invitation
from
the
pasha
and
we
wound
our
way
up
to
the
castle
at
the
gates
there
were
groups
of
soldiers
some
smoking
and
some
lying
flat
like
corpses
upon
the
cool
stones
we
went
through
courts
ascended
steps
passed
along
a
corridor
and
walked
into
an
airy
whitewashed
room
with
an
european
clock
at
one
end
of
it
and
moostapha
pasha
at
the
other
the
fine
old
bearded
potentate
looked
very
like
jove
too
in
the
midst
of
his
clouds
for
the
silvery
fumes
of
the
hung
lightly
circling
round
him
the
pasha
received
us
with
the
smooth
kind
gentle
manner
that
belongs
to
osmanlees
then
he
lightly
clapped
his
hands
and
instantly
the
sound
filled
all
the
lower
end
of
the
room
with
slaves
a
syllable
dropped
from
his
lips
which
bowed
all
heads
and
conjured
away
the
attendants
like
ghosts
their
coming
and
their
going
was
thus
swift
and
quiet
because
their
feet
were
bare
and
they
passed
through
no
door
but
only
by
the
yielding
folds
of
a
purder
soon
the
appeared
every
man
carrying
separately
his
tiny
cup
in
a
small
metal
stand
and
presently
to
each
of
us
there
came
a
who
first
rested
the
bowl
of
the
at
a
measured
distance
on
the
floor
and
then
on
this
axis
wheeled
round
the
long
cheery
stick
and
gracefully
presented
it
on
knee
already
the
fire
was
glowing
secure
in
the
bowl
and
so
when
i
pressed
the
amber
lip
to
mine
there
was
no
coyness
to
conquer
the
willing
fume
came
up
and
answered
my
slightest
sigh
and
followed
softly
every
breath
inspired
till
it
touched
me
with
some
faint
sense
and
understanding
of
asiatic
contentment
asiatic
contentment
yet
scarcely
perhaps
one
hour
before
i
had
been
wanting
my
bill
and
ringing
for
waiters
in
a
shrill
and
busy
hotel
in
the
ottoman
dominions
there
is
scarcely
any
hereditary
influence
except
that
which
belongs
to
the
family
of
the
sultan
and
wealth
too
is
a
highly
volatile
blessing
not
easily
transmitted
to
the
descendant
of
the
owner
from
these
causes
it
results
that
the
people
standing
in
the
place
of
nobles
and
gentry
are
official
personages
and
though
many
indeed
the
greater
number
of
these
potentates
are
humbly
born
and
bred
you
will
seldom
i
think
find
them
wanting
in
that
polished
smoothness
of
manner
and
those
tones
which
belong
to
the
best
osmanlees
the
truth
is
that
most
of
the
men
in
authority
have
risen
from
their
humble
station
by
the
arts
of
the
courtier
and
they
preserve
in
their
high
estate
those
gentle
powers
of
fascination
to
which
they
owe
their
success
yet
unless
you
can
contrive
to
learn
a
little
of
the
language
you
will
be
rather
bored
by
your
visits
of
ceremony
the
intervention
of
the
interpreter
or
dragoman
as
he
is
called
is
fatal
to
the
spirit
of
conversation
i
think
i
should
mislead
you
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
give
the
substance
of
any
particular
conversation
with
orientals
a
traveller
may
write
and
say
that
the
pasha
of
was
particularly
interested
in
the
vast
progress
which
has
been
made
in
the
application
of
steam
and
appeared
to
understand
the
structure
of
our
he
remarked
upon
the
gigantic
results
of
our
manufacturing
that
he
possessed
considerable
knowledge
of
our
indian
affairs
and
of
the
constitution
of
the
company
and
expressed
a
lively
admiration
of
the
many
sterling
qualities
for
which
the
people
of
england
are
but
the
heap
of
commonplaces

to
find
that

such

i
should
like
him
to
know
though
that
we
have
got
something
in

besides
that
these
foreigners
are
always
fancying
that
we
have
nothing
but
ships

just
tell
the

that
even
within

two
hundred

there
has
been

improvement

if
he
does
not
take
any
interest
about
that
at

you
can
explain
that
we
have
our
virtues
in
the
we
are

are
faithful
in
the
performance
of

for
the
osmanlees

turkish
travelling
in
two
or
three
hours
our
party
was
ready
the
servants
the
tatar
the
mounted
suridgees
and
the
altogether
made
up
a
strong
cavalcade
the
accomplished
mysseri
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
so
often
and
who
served
me
so
faithfully
throughout
my
oriental
journeys
acted
as
our
interpreter
and
was
in
fact
the
brain
of
our
corps
the
tatar
you
know
is
a
government
courier
properly
employed
in
carrying
despatches
but
also
sent
with
travellers
to
speed
them
on
their
way
and
answer
with
his
head
for
their
safety
the
man
whose
head
was
thus
pledged
for
our
precious
lives
was
a
fellow
with
the
regular
and
handsome
cast
of
countenance
which
is
now
characteristic
of
the
ottoman
race
his
features
displayed
a
good
deal
of
serene
pride
fortitude
a
kind
of
ingenuous
sensuality
and
something
of
instinctive
wisdom
without
any
sharpness
of
intellect
he
had
been
a
janissary
as
i
afterwards
found
and
kept
up
the
odd
strut
of
his
old
corps
which
used
to
affright
the
christians
in
former
rolling
gait
so
comically
pompous
that
a
close
imitation
of
it
even
in
the
broadest
farce
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
very
rough
of
the
character
it
is
occasioned
in
part
by
dress
and
accoutrements
the
weighty
bundle
of
weapons
carried
upon
the
chest
throws
back
the
body
so
as
to
give
it
a
wonderful
portliness
and
moreover
the
immense
masses
of
clothes
that
swathe
his
limbs
force
the
wearer
in
walking
to
swing
himself
heavily
round
from
left
to
right
and
from
right
to
left
in
truth
this
great
edifice
of
woollen
and
cotton
and
silk
and
silver
and
brass
and
steel
is
not
at
all
fitted
for
moving
on
foot
it
can
not
even
walk
without
frightfully
discomposing
its
fair
proportions
and
as
to
tatar
ran
it
was
in
order
to
pick
up
a
partridge
that
methley
had
winged
with
a
and
really
the
attempt
was
one
of
the
funniest
misdirections
of
human
energy
that
wondering
man
ever
saw
but
put
him
in
his
stirrups
and
then
is
the
tatar
himself
again
there
he
lives
at
his
pleasure
reposing
in
the
tranquillity
of
that
true
home
the
home
of
his
ancestors
which
the
saddle
seems
to
afford
him
and
drawing
from
his
pipe
the
calm
pleasures
of
his
own
fireside
or
else
dashing
sudden
over
the
earth
as
though
for
a
moment
he
felt
the
mouth
of
a
turcoman
steed
and
saw
his
own
scythian
plains
lying
boundless
and
open
before
him
it
was
not
till
his
subordinates
had
nearly
completed
their
preparations
for
their
march
that
our
tatar
commanding
the
forces
arrived
he
came
sleek
and
fresh
from
the
bath
for
so
is
the
custom
of
the
ottomans
when
they
start
upon
a
journey
and
was
carefully
accoutred
at
every
point
from
his
thigh
to
his
throat
he
was
loaded
with
arms
and
other
implements
of
a
campaigning
life
there
is
no
scarcity
of
water
along
the
whole
road
from
belgrade
to
stamboul
but
the
habits
of
our
tatar
were
formed
by
his
ancestors
and
not
by
himself
so
he
took
good
care
to
see
that
his
leathern
was
amply
charged
and
properly
strapped
to
the
saddle
along
with
his
blessed
and
now
at
last
he
has
cursed
the
suridgees
in
all
proper
figures
of
speech
and
is
ready
for
a
ride
of
a
thousand
miles
but
before
he
comforts
his
soul
in
the
marble
baths
of
stamboul
he
will
be
another
and
a
lesser
man
his
sense
of
responsibility
his
too
strict
abstemiousness
and
his
restless
energy
disdainful
of
sleep
will
have
worn
him
down
to
a
fraction
of
the
sleek
moostapha
that
now
leads
out
our
party
from
the
gates
of
belgrade
the
suridgees
are
the
men
employed
to
lead
the
they
are
most
of
them
gipsies
their
lot
is
a
sad
one
they
are
the
last
of
the
human
race
and
all
the
sins
of
their
superiors
including
the
horses
can
safely
be
visited
on
them
but
the
wretched
look
often
more
picturesque
than
their
betters
and
though
all
the
world
despise
these
poor
suridgees
their
tawny
skins
and
their
grisly
beards
will
gain
them
honourable
standing
in
the
foreground
of
a
landscape
we
had
a
couple
of
these
fellows
with
us
each
leading
a
to
the
tail
of
which
last
another
was
attached
there
was
a
world
of
trouble
in
persuading
the
stiff
angular
portmanteaus
of
europe
to
adapt
themselves
to
their
new
condition
and
sit
quietly
on
but
all
was
right
at
last
and
it
gladdened
my
eyes
to
see
our
little
troop
file
off
through
the
winding
lanes
of
the
city
and
show
down
brightly
in
the
plain
beneath
the
one
of
our
party
that
seemed
to
be
most
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
was
methley
s
yorkshire
servant
who
always
rode
doggedly
on
in
his
pantry
jacket
looking
out
for
gentlemen
s
methley
and
i
had
english
saddles
but
i
think
we
should
have
done
just
as
well
i
should
certainly
have
seen
more
of
the
country
if
we
had
adopted
saddles
like
that
of
our
tatar
who
towered
so
loftily
over
the
scraggy
little
beast
that
carried
him
in
taking
thought
for
the
east
whilst
in
england
i
had
made
one
capital
hit
which
you
must
not
had
brought
with
me
a
pair
of
common
spurs
these
were
a
great
comfort
to
me
throughout
my
horseback
travels
by
keeping
up
the
cheerfulness
of
the
many
unhappy
nags
that
i
had
to
bestride
the
angle
of
the
oriental
stirrup
is
a
very
poor
substitute
for
spurs
the
ottoman
horseman
raised
by
his
saddle
to
a
great
height
above
the
humble
level
of
the
back
that
he
bestrides
and
using
an
awfully
sharp
bit
is
able
to
lift
the
crest
of
his
nag
and
force
him
into
a
strangely
fast
shuffling
walk
the
orthodox
pace
for
the
journey
my
comrade
and
i
using
english
saddles
could
not
easily
keep
our
beasts
up
to
this
peculiar
amble
besides
we
thought
it
a
bore
to
be
by
our
attendants
for
a
thousand
miles
and
we
generally
therefore
did
duty
as
the
rearguard
of
our
grand
army
we
used
to
walk
our
horses
till
the
party
in
front
had
got
into
the
distance
and
then
retrieve
the
lost
ground
by
a
gallop
we
had
ridden
on
for
some
two
or
three
hours
the
stir
and
bustle
of
our
commencing
journey
had
ceased
the
liveliness
of
our
little
troop
had
worn
off
with
the
declining
day
and
the
night
closed
in
as
we
entered
the
great
servian
forest
through
this
our
road
was
to
last
for
more
than
a
hundred
miles
endless
and
endless
now
on
either
side
the
tall
oaks
closed
in
their
ranks
and
stood
gloomily
lowering
over
us
as
grim
as
an
army
of
giants
with
a
thousand
years
pay
in
arrear
one
strived
with
listening
ear
to
catch
some
tidings
of
that
forest
world
stirring
of
beasts
some
s
scream
but
all
was
quite
hushed
except
the
voice
of
the
cicalas
that
peopled
every
bough
and
filled
the
depths
of
the
forest
through
and
through
with
one
same
hum
stilling
than
very
silence
at
first
our
way
was
in
darkness
but
after
a
while
the
moon
got
up
and
touched
the
glittering
arms
and
tawny
faces
of
our
men
with
light
so
pale
and
mystic
that
the
watchful
tatar
felt
bound
to
look
out
for
demons
and
take
proper
means
for
keeping
them
off
forthwith
he
determined
that
the
duty
of
frightening
away
our
ghostly
enemies
like
every
other
troublesome
work
should
fall
upon
the
poor
suridgees
who
accordingly
lifted
up
their
voices
and
burst
upon
the
dreadful
stillness
of
the
forest
with
shrieks
and
dismal
howls
these
precautions
were
kept
up
incessantly
and
were
followed
by
the
most
complete
success
for
not
one
demon
came
near
us
long
before
midnight
we
reached
the
hamlet
in
which
we
were
to
rest
for
the
night
it
was
made
up
of
about
a
dozen
clay
huts
standing
upon
a
small
tract
of
ground
hardly
won
from
the
forest
the
peasants
that
lived
there
spoke
a
slavonic
dialect
and
mysseri
s
knowledge
of
the
russian
tongue
enabled
him
to
talk
with
them
freely
we
took
up
our
quarters
in
a
square
room
with
white
walls
and
an
earthen
floor
quite
bare
of
furniture
and
utterly
void
of
women
they
told
us
however
that
these
servian
villagers
lived
in
happy
abundance
but
that
they
were
careful
to
conceal
their
riches
as
well
as
their
wives
the
burthens
unstrapped
from
the
very
quickly
furnished
our
den
a
couple
of
quilts
spread
upon
the
floor
with
a
at
the
head
of
each
became
capital
and
and
and
books
and
maps
and
gleaming
arms
soon
lay
strewed
around
us
in
pleasant
confusion
mysseri
s
canteen
too
began
to
yield
up
its
treasures
but
we
relied
upon
finding
some
provisions
in
the
village
at
first
the
natives
declared
that
their
hens
were
mere
old
maids
and
all
their
cows
unmarried
but
our
tatar
swore
such
a
grand
sonorous
oath
and
fingered
the
hilt
of
his
yataghan
with
such
persuasive
touch
that
the
land
soon
flowed
with
milk
and
mountains
of
eggs
arose
and
soon
there
was
tea
before
us
with
all
its
unspeakable
fragrance
and
as
we
reclined
on
the
floor
we
found
that
a
portmanteau
was
just
the
right
height
for
a
table
the
duty
of
candlesticks
was
ably
performed
by
a
couple
of
intelligent
natives
the
rest
of
the
villagers
stood
by
the
open
doorway
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
and
watched
our
banqueting
with
grave
and
devout
attention
the
first
night
of
your
first
campaign
though
you
be
but
a
mere
peaceful
campaigner
is
a
glorious
time
in
your
life
it
is
so
sweet
to
find
one
s
self
free
from
the
stale
civilisation
of
europe
oh
my
dear
ally
when
first
you
spread
your
carpet
in
the
midst
of
these
eastern
scenes
do
think
for
a
moment
of
those
your
that
dwell
in
squares
and
streets
and
even
for
such
is
the
fate
of
many
in
actual
country
houses
think
of
the
people
that
are
presenting
their
compliments
and
requesting
the
honour
and
much
regretting
those
that
are
pinioned
at
or
stuck
up
in
ballrooms
or
cruelly
planted
in
pews
think
of
these
and
so
remembering
how
many
poor
devils
are
living
in
a
state
of
utter
respectability
you
will
glory
the
more
in
your
own
delightful
escape
i
am
bound
to
confess
however
that
with
all
its
charms
a
mud
floor
like
a
mercenary
match
does
certainly
promote
early
rising
long
before
daybreak
we
were
up
and
had
breakfasted
after
this
there
was
nearly
a
whole
tedious
hour
to
endure
whilst
the
horses
were
laden
by
torchlight
but
this
had
an
end
and
at
last
we
went
on
once
more
cloaked
and
sombre
at
first
we
made
our
sullen
way
through
the
darkness
with
scarcely
one
barter
of
words
but
soon
the
genial
morn
burst
down
from
heaven
and
stirred
the
blood
so
gladly
through
our
veins
that
the
very
suridgees
with
all
their
troubles
could
now
look
up
for
an
instant
and
almost
seem
to
believe
in
the
temporary
goodness
of
god
the
actual
movement
from
one
place
to
another
in
europeanised
countries
is
a
process
so
occupies
i
mean
so
small
a
proportion
of
the
traveller
s
entire
his
mind
remains
unsettled
so
long
as
the
wheels
are
going
he
may
be
alive
enough
to
external
objects
of
interest
and
to
the
crowding
ideas
which
are
often
invited
by
the
excitement
of
a
changing
scene
but
he
is
still
conscious
of
being
in
a
provisional
state
and
his
mind
is
constantly
recurring
to
the
expected
end
of
his
journey
his
ordinary
ways
of
thought
have
been
interrupted
and
before
any
new
mental
habits
can
be
formed
he
is
quietly
fixed
in
his
hotel
it
will
be
otherwise
with
you
when
you
journey
in
the
east
day
after
day
perhaps
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
your
foot
is
in
the
stirrup
to
taste
the
cold
breath
of
the
earliest
morn
and
to
lead
or
follow
your
bright
cavalcade
till
sunset
through
forests
and
mountain
passes
through
valleys
and
desolate
plains
all
this
becomes
your
mode
of
life
and
you
ride
eat
drink
and
curse
the
mosquitoes
as
systematically
as
your
friends
in
england
eat
drink
and
sleep
if
you
are
wise
you
will
not
look
upon
the
long
period
of
time
thus
occupied
in
actual
movement
as
the
mere
gulf
dividing
you
from
the
end
of
your
journey
but
rather
as
one
of
those
rare
and
plastic
seasons
of
your
life
from
which
perhaps
in
after
times
you
may
love
to
date
the
moulding
of
your
is
your
very
identity
once
feel
this
and
you
will
soon
grow
happy
and
contented
in
your
as
for
me
and
my
comrade
however
in
this
part
of
our
journey
we
often
forgot
stamboul
forgot
all
the
ottoman
empire
and
only
remembered
old
times
we
went
back
loitering
on
the
banks
of
grim
old
thames
of
after
life
that
washes
the
parliament
houses
and
drowns
despairing
thames
the
old
eton
fellow
that
wrestled
with
us
in
our
boyhood
till
he
taught
us
to
be
stronger
than
he
we
bullied
keate
and
scoffed
at
larry
miller
and
okes
we
rode
along
loudly
laughing
and
talked
to
the
grave
servian
forest
as
though
it
were
the
brocas
our
pace
was
commonly
very
slow
for
the
served
us
for
a
drag
and
kept
us
to
a
rate
of
little
more
than
five
miles
in
the
hour
but
now
and
then
and
chiefly
at
night
a
spirit
of
movement
would
suddenly
animate
the
whole
party
the
would
be
teased
into
a
gallop
and
when
once
this
was
done
there
would
be
such
a
banging
of
portmanteaus
and
such
convulsions
of
upon
their
panting
sides
and
the
suridgees
would
follow
them
up
with
such
a
hurricane
of
blows
and
screams
and
curses
that
stopping
or
relaxing
was
scarcely
possible
then
the
rest
of
us
would
put
our
horses
into
a
gallop
and
so
all
shouting
cheerily
would
hunt
and
drive
the
sumpter
beasts
like
a
flock
of
goats
up
hill
and
down
dale
right
on
to
the
end
of
their
journey
the
distances
at
which
we
got
relays
of
horses
varied
greatly
some
were
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
but
twice
i
think
we
performed
a
whole
day
s
journey
of
more
than
sixty
miles
with
the
same
beasts
when
at
last
we
came
out
from
the
forest
our
road
lay
through
scenes
like
those
of
an
english
park
the
green
sward
unfenced
and
left
to
the
free
pasture
of
cattle
was
dotted
with
groups
of
stately
trees
and
here
and
there
darkened
over
with
larger
masses
of
wood
that
seemed
gathered
together
for
bounding
the
domain
and
shutting
out
some
infernal
in
the
shape
of
a
newly
made
squire
in
one
or
two
spots
the
hanging
copses
looked
down
upon
a
lawn
below
with
such
sheltering
mien
that
seeing
the
like
in
england
you
would
have
been
tempted
almost
to
ask
the
name
of
the
spendthrift
or
the
madman
who
had
dared
to
pull
down
the
old
there
are
few
countries
less
infested
by
lions
than
the
provinces
on
this
part
of
your
route
you
are
not
called
upon
to
drop
a
tear
over
the
tomb
of
the
once
brilliant
anybody
or
to
pay
your
tribute
of
respect
to
anything
dead
or
alive
there
are
no
servian
or
bulgarian
litterateurs
with
whom
it
would
be
positively
disgraceful
not
to
form
an
acquaintance
you
have
no
staring
no
praising
to
get
through
the
only
public
building
of
any
interest
that
lies
on
the
road
is
of
modern
date
but
is
said
to
be
a
good
specimen
of
oriental
architecture
it
is
of
a
pyramidical
shape
and
is
made
up
of
thirty
thousand
skulls
contributed
by
the
rebellious
servians
in
the
early
part
i
believe
of
this
century
i
am
not
at
all
sure
of
my
date
but
i
fancy
it
was
in
the
year
that
the
first
skull
was
laid
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
in
the
darkness
of
the
early
morning
we
unknowingly
went
by
the
neighbourhood
of
this
triumph
of
art
and
so
basely
got
off
from
admiring
the
simple
grandeur
of
the
architect
s
conception
and
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
there
being
no
lions
we
ought
at
least
to
have
met
with
a
few
perils
but
the
only
robbers
we
saw
anything
of
had
been
long
since
dead
and
gone
the
poor
fellows
had
been
impaled
upon
high
poles
and
so
propped
up
by
the
transverse
spokes
beneath
them
that
their
skeletons
clothed
with
some
white
remains
of
flesh
still
sat
up
lolling
in
the
sunshine
and
listlessly
stared
without
eyes
one
day
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
path
was
a
little
more
rugged
than
usual
and
i
found
that
i
was
deserving
for
myself
the
title
of
sabalkansky
or
transcender
of
the
the
truth
is
that
as
a
military
barrier
the
balcan
is
a
fabulous
mountain
such
seems
to
be
the
view
of
major
keppell
who
looked
on
it
towards
the
east
with
the
eye
of
a
soldier
and
certainly
in
the
sophia
pass
which
i
followed
there
is
no
narrow
defile
and
no
ascent
sufficiently
difficult
to
stop
or
delay
for
long
time
a
train
of
siege
artillery
before
we
reached
adrianople
methley
had
been
seized
with
we
knew
not
what
ailment
and
when
we
had
taken
up
our
quarters
in
the
city
he
was
cast
to
the
very
earth
by
sickness
andrianople
enjoyed
an
english
consul
and
i
felt
sure
that
in
eastern
phrase
his
house
would
cease
to
be
his
house
and
would
become
the
house
of
my
sick
comrade
i
should
have
judged
rightly
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
the
levelling
plague
was
abroad
and
the
dread
of
it
had
dominion
over
the
consular
mind
so
now
whether
dying
or
not
one
could
hardly
tell
upon
a
quilt
stretched
out
along
the
floor
there
lay
the
best
hope
of
an
ancient
line
without
the
material
aids
to
comfort
of
even
the
humblest
sort
and
sad
to
say
without
the
consolation
of
a
friend
or
even
a
comrade
worth
having
i
have
a
notion
that
tenderness
and
pity
are
affections
occasioned
in
some
measure
by
living
within
doors
certainly
at
the
time
i
speak
of
the
life
which
i
have
been
leading
or
the
wayfaring
hardships
of
the
journey
had
so
strangely
blunted
me
that
i
felt
intolerant
of
illness
and
looked
down
upon
my
companion
as
if
the
poor
fellow
in
falling
ill
had
betrayed
a
want
of
spirit
i
entertained
too
a
most
absurd
idea
that
his
illness
was
partly
affected
you
see
that
i
have
made
a
confession
this
i
i
may
always
hereafter
look
charitably
upon
the
hard
savage
acts
of
peasants
and
the
cruelties
of
a
brutal
soldiery
god
knows
that
i
strived
to
melt
myself
into
common
charity
and
to
put
on
a
gentleness
which
i
could
not
feel
but
this
attempt
did
not
cheat
the
keenness
of
the
sufferer
he
could
not
have
felt
the
less
deserted
because
that
i
was
with
him
we
called
to
aid
a
solemn
armenian
i
think
he
was
half
soothsayer
half
hakim
or
doctor
who
all
the
while
counting
his
beads
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
patient
and
then
suddenly
dealt
him
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
methley
bravely
dissembled
his
pain
for
he
fancied
that
the
blow
was
meant
to
try
whether
or
not
the
plague
were
on
him
here
was
really
a
sad
bed
nothing
to
offer
the
invalid
in
the
shape
of
food
save
a
piece
of
thin
tough
flexible
cloth
made
of
flour
and
in
equal
proportions
and
called
by
the
name
of
bread
then
the
patient
of
course
had
no
confidence
in
his
medical
man
and
on
the
whole
the
best
chance
of
saving
my
comrade
seemed
to
lie
in
taking
him
out
of
the
reach
of
his
doctor
and
bearing
him
away
to
the
neighbourhood
of
some
more
genial
consul
but
how
was
this
to
be
done
methley
was
much
too
ill
to
be
kept
in
his
saddle
and
wheel
carriages
as
means
of
travelling
were
unknown
there
is
however
such
a
thing
as
an
araba
a
vehicle
drawn
by
oxen
in
which
the
wives
of
a
rich
man
are
sometimes
dragged
four
or
five
miles
over
the
grass
by
way
of
recreation
the
carriage
is
rudely
framed
but
you
recognise
in
the
simple
grandeur
of
its
design
a
likeness
to
things
majestic
in
short
if
your
carpenter
s
son
were
to
make
a
lord
mayor
s
coach
for
little
amy
he
would
build
a
carriage
very
much
in
the
style
of
a
turkish
araba
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
horses
being
used
for
drawing
a
carriage
in
this
part
of
the
world
but
necessity
is
the
mother
of
innovation
as
well
as
of
invention
i
was
fully
justified
i
think
in
arguing
that
there
were
numerous
instances
of
horses
being
used
for
that
purpose
in
our
own
the
laws
of
nature
are
uniform
in
their
operation
over
all
the
world
except
ireland
that
which
was
true
in
piccadilly
must
be
true
in
the
matter
could
not
fairly
be
treated
as
an
ecclesiastical
question
for
that
the
circumstance
of
methley
s
going
on
to
stamboul
in
an
araba
drawn
by
horses
when
calmly
and
dispassionately
considered
would
appear
to
be
perfectly
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
the
mahometan
religion
as
by
law
established
thus
poor
dear
patient
reason
would
have
fought
her
slow
battle
against
asiatic
prejudice
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
would
have
established
the
possibility
and
perhaps
even
the
propriety
of
harnessing
horses
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
but
in
the
meantime
mysseri
well
seconded
by
our
tatar
put
a
very
quick
end
to
the
controversy
by
having
the
horses
put
to
it
was
a
sore
thing
for
me
to
see
my
poor
comrade
brought
to
this
for
young
though
he
was
he
was
a
veteran
in
travel
when
scarcely
yet
of
age
he
had
invaded
india
from
the
frontiers
of
russia
and
that
so
swiftly
that
measuring
by
the
time
of
his
flight
the
broad
dominions
of
the
king
of
kings
were
shrivelled
up
to
a
dukedom
and
now
poor
fellow
he
was
to
be
poked
into
an
araba
like
a
georgian
girl
he
suffered
greatly
for
there
were
no
springs
for
the
carriage
and
no
road
for
the
wheels
and
so
the
concern
jolted
on
over
the
open
country
with
such
twists
and
jerks
and
jumps
as
might
almost
dislocate
the
supple
tongue
of
satan
all
day
the
patient
kept
himself
shut
up
within
the
of
the
araba
and
i
could
hardly
know
how
he
was
faring
until
the
end
of
the
day
s
journey
when
i
found
that
he
was
not
worse
and
was
buoyed
up
with
the
hope
of
some
day
reaching
constantinople
i
was
always
conning
over
my
maps
and
fancied
that
i
knew
pretty
well
my
line
but
after
adrianople
i
had
made
more
southing
than
i
knew
for
and
it
was
with
unbelieving
wonder
and
delight
that
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
shore
of
the
sea
a
little
while
and
its
gentle
billows
were
flowing
beneath
the
hoofs
of
my
beast
but
the
hearing
of
the
ripple
was
not
enough
communion
and
the
seeing
of
the
blue
propontis
was
not
to
know
and
possess
must
needs
plunge
into
its
depth
and
quench
my
longing
love
in
the
palpable
waves
and
so
when
old
moostapha
defender
against
demons
looked
round
for
his
charge
he
saw
with
horror
and
dismay
that
he
for
whose
life
his
own
life
stood
pledged
was
possessed
of
some
devil
who
had
driven
him
down
into
the
the
rider
and
the
steed
had
vanished
from
earth
and
that
out
among
the
waves
was
the
gasping
crest
of
a
and
the
ghostly
head
of
the
englishman
moving
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
we
started
very
early
indeed
on
the
last
day
of
our
journey
and
from
the
moment
of
being
off
until
we
gained
the
shelter
of
the
imperial
walls
we
were
struggling
face
to
face
with
an
icy
storm
that
swept
right
down
from
the
steppes
of
tartary
keen
fierce
and
steady
as
a
northern
conqueror
methley
s
servant
who
was
the
greatest
sufferer
kept
his
saddle
until
we
reached
stamboul
but
was
then
found
to
be
quite
benumbed
in
limbs
and
his
brain
was
so
much
affected
that
when
he
was
lifted
from
his
horse
he
fell
away
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
the
first
stage
of
a
dangerous
fever
our
tatar
worn
down
by
care
and
toil
and
carrying
seven
heavens
full
of
water
in
his
manifold
jackets
and
shawls
was
a
mere
weak
and
vapid
dilution
of
the
sleek
moostapha
who
scarce
more
than
one
fortnight
before
came
out
like
a
bridegroom
from
his
chamber
to
take
the
command
of
our
party
mysseri
seemed
somewhat
but
he
had
lost
none
of
his
strangely
quiet
energy
he
wore
a
grave
look
however
for
he
now
had
learnt
that
the
plague
was
prevailing
at
constantinople
and
he
was
fearing
that
our
two
sick
men
and
the
miserable
looks
of
our
whole
party
might
make
us
unwelcome
at
pera
we
crossed
the
golden
horn
in
a
caïque
as
soon
as
we
had
landed
some
fellows
were
got
together
and
laden
with
our
baggage
then
on
we
went
dripping
and
sloshing
and
looking
very
like
men
that
had
been
turned
back
by
the
royal
humane
society
as
being
incurably
drowned
supporting
our
sick
we
climbed
up
shelving
steps
and
threaded
many
windings
and
at
last
came
up
into
the
main
street
of
pera
humbly
hoping
that
we
might
not
be
judged
guilty
of
plague
and
so
be
cast
back
with
horror
from
the
doors
of
the
shuddering
christians
such
was
the
condition
of
our
party
which
fifteen
days
before
had
filed
away
so
gaily
from
the
gates
of
belgrade
a
couple
of
fevers
and
a
storm
had
thoroughly
spoiled
our
looks
the
interest
of
mysseri
with
the
house
of
giuseppini
was
too
powerful
to
be
denied
and
at
once
though
not
without
fear
and
trembling
we
were
admitted
as
guests

even
if
we
don
t
take
a
part
in
the
chant
about

and
minarets
we
can
still
yield
praises
to
stamboul
we
can
chant
about

we
can
say
and
sing
that
nowhere

does
the

there
are
no
pebbly

slimy

nor

to
divide
the
very
heart
of
the
place
from
the
deep
waters
if
being
in
the
noisiest
mart
of
stamboul
you
would
stroll
to
the
quiet
side
of
the
way
amidst
those
cypresses
opposite
you
will
cross
the
fathomless
bosphorus
if
you
would
go
from
your

to
the
bazaars
you
must
go
by
the
bright
blue
pathway
of
the
golden
horn
that
can
carry
a
thousand
sail
of
the
line
you
are
accustomed
to
the
gondolas
that
glide
among
the
palaces

but
here
at
stamboul
it
is
a
ship
that
meets
you
in
the
street
venice
strains
out
from
the
steadfast
land
and
in
old
times
would
send
forth
the
chief
of
the
state
to
woo
and
wed
the
reluctant

but
the
stormy
bride
of
the
doge
is
the

comes
to
his
feet

his
armed
navies
to
the
very
gates
of
his

of
his

intrigues
of
his
quiets
the
scandals
of
his
extinguishes
his
rivals
and
hushes
his
naughty
wives
all
one
by
one
so
vast
are
the
wonders
of
the
deep
all
the
while
that
i
stayed
at
constantinople
the
plague
was
prevailing
but
not
with
any
degree
of
violence
its
presence
however
lent
a
mysterious
and
exciting
though
not
very
pleasant
interest
to
my
first
knowledge
of
a
great
oriental
city
it
gave
tone
and
colour
to
all
i
saw
and
all
i
tone
and
a
colour
sombre
enough
but
true
and
well
befitting
the
dreary
monuments
of
past
power
and
splendour
with
all
that
is
most
truly
oriental
in
its
character
the
plague
is
associated
it
dwells
with
the
faithful
in
the
holiest
quarters
of
their
city
the
coats
and
the
hats
of
pera
are
held
to
be
nearly
as
innocent
of
infection
as
they
are
ugly
in
shape
and
fashion
but
the
rich
furs
and
the
costly
shawls
the
broidered
slippers
and
the
the
fragrance
of
burning
aloes
and
the
rich
aroma
of
are
the
signs
that
mark
the
familiar
home
of
plague
you
go
out
from
your
queenly
centre
of
the
greatest
and
strongest
amongst
all
earthly
go
out
thence
and
travel
on
to
the
capital
of
an
eastern
prince
you
find
but
a
waning
power
and
a
faded
splendour
that
inclines
you
to
laugh
and
mock
but
let
the
infernal
angel
of
plague
be
at
hand
and
he
more
mighty
than
armies
more
terrible
than
suleyman
in
his
glory
can
restore
such
pomp
and
majesty
to
the
weakness
of
the
imperial
city
that
if
he
is
you
must
still
go
prying
amongst
the
shades
of
this
dead
empire
at
least
you
will
tread
the
path
with
seemly
reverence
and
awe
it
is
the
firm
faith
of
almost
all
the
europeans
living
in
the
east
that
plague
is
conveyed
by
the
touch
of
infected
substances
and
that
the
deadly
atoms
especially
lurk
in
all
kinds
of
clothes
and
furs
it
is
held
safer
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
a
man
sick
of
the
plague
and
even
to
come
in
contact
with
his
skin
than
to
be
touched
by
the
smallest
particle
of
woollen
or
of
thread
which
may
have
been
within
the
reach
of
possible
infection
if
this
be
a
right
notion
the
spread
of
the
malady
must
be
materially
aided
by
the
observance
of
a
custom
prevailing
amongst
the
people
of
stamboul
it
is
this
when
an
osmanlee
dies
one
of
his
dresses
is
cut
up
and
a
small
piece
of
it
is
sent
to
each
of
his
friends
as
a
memorial
of
the
fatal
present
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
franks
for
it
too
often
forces
the
living
not
merely
to
remember
the
dead
man
but
to
follow
and
bear
him
company
the
europeans
during
the
prevalence
of
the
plague
if
they
are
forced
to
venture
into
the
streets
will
carefully
avoid
the
touch
of
every
human
being
whom
they
pass
their
conduct
in
this
respect
shows
them
strongly
in
contrast
with
the
true
believers
the
moslem
stalks
on
serenely
as
though
he
were
under
the
eye
of
his
god
and
were
equal
to
either
fate
the
franks
go
crouching
and
slinking
from
death
and
some
those
chiefly
of
french
extraction
will
fondly
strive
to
fence
out
destiny
with
shining
capes
of
oilskin
for
some
time
you
may
manage
by
great
care
to
thread
your
way
through
the
streets
of
stamboul
without
incurring
contact
for
the
turks
though
scornful
of
the
terrors
felt
by
the
franks
are
generally
very
courteous
in
yielding
to
that
which
they
hold
to
be
a
useless
and
impious
precaution
and
will
let
you
pass
safe
if
they
can
it
is
impossible
however
that
your
immunity
can
last
for
any
length
of
time
if
you
move
about
much
through
the
narrow
streets
and
lanes
of
a
crowded
city
as
for
me
i
soon
got
after
one
day
of
rest
the
prayers
of
my
hostess
began
to
lose
their
power
of
keeping
me
from
the
pestilent
side
of
the
golden
horn
faithfully
promising
to
shun
the
touch
of
all
imaginable
substances
however
enticing
i
set
off
very
cautiously
and
held
my
way
uncompromised
till
i
reached
the
water
s
edge
but
before
my
caïque
was
quite
ready
some
fellows
came
rapidly
shambling
down
the
steps
with
a
corpse
which
they
were
going
to
bury
amongst
the
faithful
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
i
contrived
to
be
so
much
in
the
way
of
this
brisk
funeral
that
i
was
not
only
touched
by
the
men
bearing
the
body
but
also
i
believe
by
the
foot
of
the
dead
man
as
it
hung
lolling
out
of
the
bier
this
accident
gave
me
such
a
strong
interest
in
denying
the
soundness
of
the
contagion
theory
that
i
did
in
fact
deny
and
repudiate
it
altogether
and
from
that
time
acting
upon
my
own
convenient
view
of
the
matter
i
went
wherever
i
chose
without
taking
any
serious
pains
to
avoid
a
touch
it
seems
to
me
now
very
likely
that
the
europeans
are
right
and
that
the
plague
may
be
really
conveyed
by
contagion
but
during
the
whole
time
of
my
remaining
in
the
east
my
views
on
this
subject
more
nearly
approached
to
those
of
the
fatalists
and
so
when
afterwards
the
plague
of
egypt
came
dealing
his
blows
around
me
i
was
able
to
live
amongst
the
dying
without
that
alarm
and
anxiety
which
would
inevitably
have
pressed
upon
my
mind
if
i
had
allowed
myself
to
believe
that
every
passing
touch
was
really
a
probable
and
perhaps
as
you
make
your
difficult
way
through
a
steep
and
narrow
alley
shut
in
between
blank
walls
and
little
frequented
by
passers
you
meet
one
of
those
bundles
of
white
linen
that
implies
an
ottoman
lady
painfully
struggling
against
the
obstacles
to
progression
interposed
by
the
many
folds
of
her
clumsy
drapery
by
her
big
and
especially
by
her
two
pairs
of
slippers
she
works
her
way
on
full
awkwardly
enough
but
yet
there
is
something
of
womanly
consciousness
in
the
very
labour
and
effort
with
which
she
tugs
and
lifts
the
burthen
of
her
charms
she
is
closely
followed
by
her
women
slaves
of
her
very
self
you
see
nothing
except
the
dark
luminous
eyes
that
stare
against
your
face
and
the
tips
of
the
painted
fingers
depending
like
rosebuds
from
out
of
the
blank
bastions
of
the
fortress
she
turns
and
turns
again
and
carefully
glances
around
her
on
all
sides
to
see
that
she
is
safe
from
the
eyes
of
mussulmans
and
then
suddenly
withdrawing
the
she
shines
upon
your
heart
and
soul
with
all
the
pomp
and
might
of
her
beauty
and
this
it
is
not
the
light
changeful
grace
that
leaves
you
to
doubt
whether
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
body
or
only
a
soul
it
is
the
beauty
that
dwells
secure
in
the
perfectness
of
hard
downright
outlines
and
in
the
glow
of
generous
colour
there
is
fire
though
courage
and
fire
enough
in
the
untamed
mind
or
spirit
or
whatever
it
is
which
drives
the
breath
of
pride
through
those
scarcely
parted
lips
you
smile
at
pretty
turn
pale
before
the
beauty
that
is
great
enough
to
have
dominion
over
you
she
sees
and
exults
in
your
giddiness
she
sees
and
smiles
then
presently
with
a
sudden
movement
she
lays
her
blushing
fingers
upon
your
arm
and
cries
out
yumourdjak
plague
meaning
there
is
a
present
of
the
plague
for
you
this
is
her
notion
of
a
witticism
it
is
a
very
old
piece
of
fun
no
an
oriental
joe
miller
but
the
turks
are
fondly
attached
not
only
to
the
institutions
but
also
to
the
jokes
of
their
ancestors
so
the
lady
s
silvery
laugh
rings
joyously
in
your
ears
and
the
mirth
of
her
women
is
boisterous
and
fresh
as
though
the
bright
idea
of
giving
the
plague
to
a
christian
had
newly
lit
upon
the
earth
methley
began
to
rally
very
soon
after
we
had
reached
constantinople
but
there
seemed
at
first
to
be
no
chance
of
his
regaining
strength
enough
for
travelling
during
the
winter
and
i
determined
to
stay
with
my
comrade
until
he
had
quite
recovered
so
i
bought
me
a
horse
and
a
pipe
of
tranquillity
and
took
a
turkish
i
troubled
myself
a
great
deal
with
the
turkish
tongue
and
gained
at
last
some
knowledge
of
its
structure
it
is
enriched
perhaps
overladen
with
persian
and
arabic
words
imported
into
the
language
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
representing
sentiments
and
religious
dogmas
and
terms
of
art
and
luxury
entirely
unknown
to
the
tartar
ancestors
of
the
present
osmanlees
but
the
body
and
the
spirit
of
the
old
tongue
are
yet
alive
and
the
smooth
words
of
the
shopkeeper
at
constantinople
can
still
carry
understanding
to
the
ears
of
the
untamed
millions
who
rove
over
the
plains
of
northern
asia
the
structure
of
the
language
especially
in
its
more
lengthy
sentences
is
very
like
to
the
latin
the
subject
matters
are
slowly
and
patiently
enumerated
without
disclosing
the
purpose
of
the
speaker
until
he
reaches
the
end
of
his
sentence
and
then
at
last
there
comes
the
clenching
word
which
gives
a
meaning
and
connection
to
all
that
has
gone
before
if
you
listen
at
all
to
speaking
of
this
kind
your
attention
rather
than
be
suffered
to
flag
must
grow
more
and
more
lively
as
the
phrase
marches
on
the
osmanlees
speak
well
in
countries
civilised
according
to
the
european
plan
the
work
of
trying
to
persuade
tribunals
is
almost
all
performed
by
a
set
of
men
the
great
body
of
whom
very
seldom
do
anything
else
but
in
turkey
this
division
of
labour
has
never
taken
place
and
every
man
is
his
own
advocate
the
importance
of
the
rhetorical
art
is
immense
for
a
bad
speech
may
endanger
the
property
of
the
speaker
as
well
as
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
the
free
enjoyment
of
his
throat
so
it
results
that
most
of
the
turks
whom
one
sees
have
a
habit
of
speaking
connectedly
and
at
length
even
the
treaties
continually
going
on
at
the
bazaar
for
the
buying
and
selling
of
the
merest
trifles
are
carried
on
by
speechifying
rather
than
by
mere
colloquies
and
the
eternal
uncertainty
as
to
the
market
value
of
things
in
constant
sale
gives
room
enough
for
discussion
the
seller
is
for
ever
demanding
a
price
immensely
beyond
that
for
which
he
sells
at
last
and
so
occasions
unspeakable
disgust
in
many
englishmen
who
can
not
see
why
an
honest
dealer
should
ask
more
for
his
goods
than
he
will
really
take
the
truth
is
however
that
an
ordinary
tradesman
of
constantinople
has
no
other
way
of
finding
out
the
fair
market
value
of
his
property
the
difficulty
under
which
he
labours
is
easily
shown
by
comparing
the
mechanism
of
the
commercial
system
in
turkey
with
that
of
our
own
country
in
england
or
in
any
other
great
mercantile
country
the
bulk
of
the
things
bought
and
sold
goes
through
the
hands
of
a
wholesale
dealer
and
it
is
he
who
higgles
and
bargains
with
an
entire
nation
of
purchasers
by
entering
into
treaty
with
retail
sellers
the
labour
of
making
a
few
large
contracts
is
sufficient
to
give
a
clue
for
finding
the
fair
market
value
of
the
goods
sold
throughout
the
country
but
in
turkey
from
the
primitive
habits
of
the
people
and
partly
from
the
absence
of
great
capital
and
great
credit
the
importing
merchant
the
warehouseman
the
wholesale
dealer
the
retail
dealer
and
the
shopman
are
all
one
person
old
moostapha
or
abdallah
or
hadgi
mohamed
waddles
up
from
the
water
s
edge
with
a
small
packet
of
merchandise
which
he
has
bought
out
of
a
greek
brigantine
and
when
at
last
he
has
reached
his
nook
in
the
bazaar
he
puts
his
goods
before
the
counter
and
himself
upon
it
then
laying
fire
to
his
he
sits
in
permanence
and
patiently
waits
to
obtain
the
best
price
that
can
be
got
in
an
open
this
is
his
fair
right
as
a
seller
but
he
has
no
means
of
finding
out
what
that
best
price
is
except
by
actual
experiment
he
can
not
know
the
intensity
of
the
demand
or
the
abundance
of
the
supply
otherwise
than
by
the
offers
which
may
be
made
for
his
little
bundle
of
goods
so
he
begins
by
asking
a
perfectly
hopeless
price
and
then
descends
the
ladder
until
he
meets
a
purchaser
for
ever
striving
to
attain
by
shadowing
out
the
this
is
the
struggle
which
creates
the
continual
occasion
for
debate
the
vendor
perceiving
that
the
unfolded
merchandise
has
caught
the
eye
of
a
possible
purchaser
commences
his
opening
speech
he
covers
his
bristling
broadcloths
and
his
meagre
silks
with
the
golden
broidery
of
oriental
praises
and
as
he
talks
along
with
the
slow
and
graceful
waving
of
his
arms
he
lifts
his
undulating
periods
upholds
and
poises
them
well
till
they
have
gathered
their
weight
and
their
strength
and
then
hurls
them
bodily
forward
with
grave
momentous
swing
the
possible
purchaser
listens
to
the
whole
speech
with
deep
and
serious
attention
but
when
it
is
over
turn
arrives
he
elaborately
endeavours
to
show
why
he
ought
not
to
buy
the
things
at
a
price
twenty
times
larger
than
their
value
bystanders
attracted
to
the
debate
take
a
part
in
it
as
independent
members
the
vendor
is
heard
in
reply
and
coming
down
with
his
price
furnishes
the
materials
for
a
new
debate
sometimes
however
the
dealer
if
he
is
a
very
pious
mussulman
and
sufficiently
rich
to
hold
back
his
ware
will
take
a
more
dignified
part
maintaining
a
kind
of
judicial
gravity
and
receiving
the
applicants
who
come
to
his
stall
as
if
they
were
rather
suitors
than
customers
he
will
quietly
hear
to
the
end
some
long
speech
that
concludes
with
an
offer
and
will
answer
it
all
with
the
one
monosyllable
yok
which
means
distinctly
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
old
heathen
world
my
habits
for
studying
military
subjects
had
been
hardening
my
heart
against
poetry
for
ever
staring
at
the
flames
of
battle
i
had
blinded
myself
to
the
lesser
and
finer
lights
that
are
shed
from
the
imaginations
of
men
in
my
reading
at
this
time
i
delighted
to
follow
from
out
of
arabian
sands
the
feet
of
the
armed
believers
and
to
stand
in
the
broad
manifest
of
tartar
devastation
and
thus
though
surrounded
at
constantinople
by
scenes
of
much
interest
to
the
classical
scholar
i
had
cast
aside
their
associations
like
an
old
greek
grammar
and
turned
my
face
to
the
shining
orient
forgetful
of
old
greece
and
all
the
pure
wealth
she
left
to
this
world
but
it
happened
to
me
one
day
to
mount
the
high
grounds
overhanging
the
streets
of
pera
i
sated
my
eyes
with
the
pomps
of
the
city
and
its
crowded
waters
and
then
i
looked
over
where
scutari
lay
half
veiled
in
her
mournful
cypresses
i
looked
yet
farther
and
higher
and
saw
in
the
heavens
a
silvery
cloud
that
stood
fast
and
still
against
the
breeze
it
was
pure
and
dazzling
white
as
might
be
the
veil
of
cytherea
yet
touched
with
such
fire
as
though
from
beneath
the
loving
eyes
of
an
immortal
were
shining
through
and
through
i
knew
the
bearing
but
had
enormously
misjudged
its
distance
and
underrated
its
height
and
so
it
was
as
a
sign
and
a
testimony
almost
as
a
call
from
the
neglected
gods
and
now
i
saw
and
acknowledged
the
snowy
crown
of
the
mysian
olympus
chapter
iv
the
troad
methley
recovered
almost
suddenly
and
we
determined
to
go
through
the
troad
together
my
comrade
was
a
capital
grecian
it
is
true
that
his
singular
mind
so
ordered
and
disposed
his
classic
lore
as
to
impress
it
with
something
of
an
original
and
barbarous
an
almost
gothic
quaintness
more
properly
belonging
to
a
rich
native
ballad
than
to
the
poetry
of
hellas
there
was
a
certain
impropriety
in
his
knowing
so
much
unfitness
in
the
idea
of
marble
fauns
and
satyrs
and
even
olympian
gods
lugged
in
under
the
oaken
roof
and
the
painted
light
of
an
odd
old
norman
hall
but
methley
abounding
in
homer
really
loved
him
as
i
believe
in
all
truth
without
whim
or
fancy
moreover
he
had
a
good
deal
of
the
practical
sagacity
of
a
yorkshireman
hippodamoio
and
this
enabled
him
to
apply
his
knowledge
with
much
more
tact
than
is
usually
shown
by
people
so
learned
as
he
i
too
loved
homer
but
not
with
a
scholar
s
love
the
most
humble
and
pious
among
women
was
yet
so
proud
a
mother
that
she
could
teach
her
firstborn
son
no
watts
hymns
no
collects
for
the
day
she
could
teach
him
in
earliest
childhood
no
less
than
this
to
find
a
home
in
his
saddle
and
to
love
old
homer
and
all
that
old
homer
sung
true
it
is
that
the
greek
was
ingeniously
rendered
into
english
the
english
of
pope
even
but
not
even
a
mesh
like
that
can
screen
an
earnest
child
from
the
fire
of
homer
s
battles
i
pored
over
the
as
over
a
hoping
and
fearing
for
the
hero
whom
yet
i
partly
scorned
but
the
by
line
i
clasped
it
to
my
brain
with
reverence
as
well
as
with
love
as
an
old
woman
deeply
trustful
sits
reading
her
bible
because
of
the
world
to
come
so
as
though
it
would
fit
me
for
the
coming
strife
of
this
temporal
world
i
read
and
read
the
even
outwardly
it
was
not
like
other
books
it
was
throned
in
towering
folios
there
was
a
preface
or
dissertation
printed
in
type
still
more
majestic
than
the
rest
of
the
book
this
i
read
but
not
till
my
enthusiasm
for
the
had
already
run
high
the
writer
compiling
the
opinions
of
many
men
and
chiefly
of
the
ancients
set
forth
i
know
not
how
quaintly
that
the
was
all
in
all
to
the
human
it
was
history
poetry
revelation
that
the
works
of
men
s
hands
were
folly
and
vanity
and
would
pass
away
like
the
dreams
of
a
child
but
that
the
kingdom
of
homer
would
endure
for
ever
and
ever
i
assented
with
all
my
soul
i
read
and
still
read
i
came
to
know
homer
a
learned
commentator
knows
something
of
the
greeks
in
the
same
sense
as
an
man
may
be
said
to
know
something
of
painting
but
take
an
untamed
child
and
leave
him
alone
for
twelve
months
with
any
translation
of
homer
and
he
will
be
nearer
by
twenty
centuries
to
the
spirit
of
old
greece
does
not
stop
in
the
ninth
year
of
the
siege
to
admire
this
or
that
group
of
words
has
no
books
in
his
tent
but
he
shares
in
vital
counsels
with
the
king
of
men
and
knows
the
inmost
souls
of
the
impending
gods
how
profanely
he
exults
over
the
powers
divine
when
they
are
taught
to
dread
the
prowess
of
mortals
and
most
of
all
how
he
rejoices
when
the
god
of
war
flies
howling
from
the
spear
of
diomed
and
mounts
into
heaven
for
safety
then
the
beautiful
episode
of
the
sixth
book
the
way
to
feel
this
is
not
to
go
casting
about
and
learning
from
pastors
and
masters
how
best
to
admire
it
the
impatient
child
is
not
grubbing
for
beauties
but
pushing
the
siege
the
women
vex
him
with
their
delays
and
their
talking
the
mention
of
the
nurse
is
personal
and
little
sympathy
has
he
for
the
child
that
is
young
enough
to
be
frightened
at
the
nodding
plume
of
a
helmet
but
all
the
while
that
he
thus
chafes
at
the
pausing
of
the
action
the
strong
vertical
light
of
homer
s
poetry
is
blazing
so
full
upon
the
people
and
things
of
the
that
soon
to
the
eyes
of
the
child
they
grow
familiar
as
his
mother
s
shawl
yet
of
this
great
gain
he
is
unconscious
and
on
he
goes
vengefully
thirsting
for
the
best
blood
of
troy
and
never
remitting
his
fierceness
till
almost
suddenly
it
is
changed
for
new
and
generous
sorrow
that
he
learns
to
feel
when
the
noblest
of
all
his
foes
lies
sadly
dying
at
the
scæan
gate
heroic
days
are
these
but
the
dark
ages
of
schoolboy
life
come
closing
over
them
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
in
the
end
yet
by
jove
at
first
sight
it
does
seem
a
sad
intellectual
fall
from
your
mother
s
to
a
buzzing
school
you
feel
so
keenly
the
delights
of
early
knowledge
you
form
strange
mystic
friendships
with
the
mere
names
of
mountains
and
seas
and
continents
and
mighty
rivers
you
learn
the
ways
of
the
planets
and
transcend
their
narrow
limits
and
ask
for
the
end
of
space
you
vex
the
electric
cylinder
till
it
yields
you
for
your
toy
to
play
with
that
subtle
fire
in
which
our
earth
was
forged
you
know
of
the
nations
that
have
towered
high
in
the
world
and
the
lives
of
the
men
who
have
saved
whole
empires
from
oblivion
what
more
will
you
ever
learn
yet
the
dismal
change
is
ordained
and
then
thin
meagre
latin
the
same
for
everybody
with
small
shreds
and
patches
of
greek
is
thrown
like
a
pauper
s
pall
over
all
your
early
lore
instead
of
sweet
knowledge
vile
monkish
doggerel
grammars
and
graduses
dictionaries
and
lexicons
and
horrible
odds
and
ends
of
dead
languages
are
given
you
for
your
portion
and
down
you
fall
from
roman
story
to
a
scrap
of
scriptores
romani
greek
poetry
down
down
to
the
cold
rations
of
poetæ
græci
cut
up
by
commentators
and
served
out
by
schoolmasters
it
was
not
the
recollection
of
school
nor
college
learning
but
the
rapturous
and
earnest
reading
of
my
childhood
which
made
me
bend
forward
so
longingly
to
the
plains
of
troy
away
from
our
people
and
our
horses
methley
and
i
went
loitering
along
by
the
willow
banks
of
a
stream
that
crept
in
quietness
through
the
low
even
plain
there
was
no
stir
of
weather
overhead
no
sound
of
rural
labour
no
sign
of
life
in
the
land
but
all
the
earth
was
dead
and
still
as
though
it
had
lain
for
thrice
a
thousand
years
under
the
leaden
gloom
of
one
unbroken
sabbath
softly
and
sadly
the
poor
dumb
patient
stream
went
winding
and
winding
along
through
its
shifting
pathway
in
some
places
its
waters
were
parted
and
then
again
lower
down
they
would
meet
once
more
i
could
see
that
the
stream
from
year
to
year
was
finding
itself
new
channels
and
flowed
no
longer
in
its
ancient
track
but
i
knew
that
the
springs
which
fed
it
were
high
on
springs
of
simois
and
scamander
it
was
coldly
and
thanklessly
and
with
vacant
unsatisfied
eyes
that
i
watched
the
slow
coming
and
gliding
away
of
the
waters
i
tell
myself
now
as
a
profane
fact
that
i
did
stand
by
that
river
methley
gathered
some
seeds
from
the
bushes
that
grew
there
but
since
that
i
am
away
from
his
banks
divine
scamander
has
recovered
the
proper
mystery
belonging
to
him
as
an
unseen
deity
a
kind
of
indistinctness
like
that
which
belongs
to
far
antiquity
has
spread
itself
over
my
memory
of
the
winding
stream
that
i
saw
with
these
very
eyes
one
s
mind
regains
in
absence
that
dominion
over
earthly
things
which
has
been
shaken
by
their
rude
contact
you
force
yourself
hardily
into
the
material
presence
of
a
mountain
or
a
river
whose
name
belongs
to
poetry
and
ancient
religion
rather
than
to
the
external
world
your
feelings
wound
up
and
kept
ready
for
some
sort
of
rapture
are
chilled
and
borne
down
for
the
time
under
all
this
load
of
real
earth
and
water
but
let
these
once
pass
out
of
sight
and
then
again
the
old
fanciful
notions
are
restored
and
the
mere
realities
which
you
have
just
been
looking
at
are
thrown
back
so
far
into
distance
that
the
very
event
of
your
intrusion
upon
such
scenes
begins
to
look
dim
and
uncertain
as
though
it
belonged
to
mythology
it
is
not
over
the
plain
before
troy
that
the
river
now
flows
its
waters
have
edged
away
far
towards
the
north
since
the
day
that
divine
scamander
whom
the
gods
call
xanthus
went
down
to
do
battle
for
ilion
with
mars
and
phoebus
and
latona
and
diana
glorying
in
her
arrows
and
venus
the
lover
of
and
now
when
i
was
vexed
at
the
migration
of
scamander
and
the
total
loss
or
absorption
of
poor
dear
simois
how
happily
methley
reminded
me
that
homer
himself
had
warned
us
of
some
such
changes
the
greeks
in
beginning
their
wall
had
neglected
the
hecatombs
due
to
the
gods
and
so
after
the
fall
of
troy
apollo
turned
the
paths
of
the
rivers
that
flow
from
ida
and
sent
them
flooding
over
the
wall
till
all
the
beach
was
smooth
and
free
from
the
unhallowed
works
of
the
greeks
it
is
true
i
see
now
on
looking
to
the
passage
that
neptune
when
the
work
of
destruction
was
done
turned
back
the
rivers
to
their
ancient
ways
ποταμους
ετρεψε
νεεσθαι
ροον
ήπερ
προσθεν
ιεν
καλλιρροον
ὑδωρ
but
their
old
channels
passing
through
that
light
pervious
soil
would
have
been
lost
in
the
nine
days
flood
and
perhaps
the
god
when
he
willed
to
bring
back
the
rivers
to
their
ancient
beds
may
have
done
his
work
but
ill
it
is
easier
they
say
to
destroy
than
it
is
to
restore
we
took
to
our
horses
again
and
went
southward
towards
the
very
plain
between
troy
and
the
tents
of
the
greeks
but
we
rode
by
a
line
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
whether
it
was
that
the
lay
of
the
ground
hindered
my
view
towards
the
sea
or
that
i
was
all
intent
upon
ida
or
whether
my
mind
was
in
vacancy
or
whether
as
is
most
like
i
had
strayed
from
the
dardan
plains
all
back
to
gentle
england
there
is
now
no
knowing
nor
caring
but
it
was
not
quite
suddenly
indeed
but
rather
as
it
were
in
the
swelling
and
falling
of
a
single
wave
that
the
reality
of
that
very
which
had
bounded
the
sight
of
the
greeks
now
visibly
acceded
to
me
and
rolled
full
in
upon
my
brain
conceive
how
deeply
that
eternal
coastline
that
fixed
horizon
those
island
rocks
must
have
graven
their
images
upon
the
minds
of
the
grecian
warriors
by
the
time
that
they
had
reached
the
ninth
year
of
the
siege
conceive
the
strength
and
the
fanciful
beauty
of
the
speeches
with
which
a
whole
army
of
imagining
men
must
have
told
their
weariness
and
how
the
sauntering
chiefs
must
have
whelmed
that
daily
daily
scene
with
their
deep
ionian
curses
and
now
it
was
that
my
eyes
were
greeted
with
a
delightful
surprise
whilst
we
were
at
constantinople
methley
and
i
had
pored
over
the
map
together
we
agreed
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
exact
site
of
troy
the
grecian
camp
must
have
been
nearly
opposite
to
the
space
betwixt
the
islands
of
imbros
and
tenedos
μεσσηγυς
τενεδοιο
και
ιμβρου
παιπαλοεσσης
but
methley
reminded
me
of
a
passage
in
the
in
which
neptune
is
represented
as
looking
at
the
scene
of
action
before
ilion
from
above
the
island
of
samothrace
now
samothrace
according
to
the
map
appeared
to
be
not
only
out
of
all
seeing
distance
from
the
troad
but
to
be
entirely
shut
out
from
it
by
the
intervening
imbros
which
is
a
larger
island
stretching
its
length
right
athwart
the
line
of
sight
from
samothrace
to
troy
piously
allowing
that
the
dread
commoter
of
our
globe
might
have
seen
all
mortal
doings
even
from
the
depth
of
his
own
cerulean
kingdom
i
still
felt
that
if
a
station
were
to
be
chosen
from
which
to
see
the
fight
old
homer
so
material
in
his
ways
of
thought
so
averse
from
all
haziness
and
overreaching
would
have
to
give
the
god
for
his
station
some
spot
within
reach
of
men
s
eyes
from
the
plains
of
troy
i
think
that
this
testing
of
the
poet
s
words
by
map
and
compass
may
have
shaken
a
little
of
my
faith
in
the
completeness
of
his
knowledge
well
now
i
had
come
there
to
the
south
was
tenedos
and
here
at
my
side
was
imbros
all
right
and
according
to
the
map
but
aloft
over
imbros
aloft
in
a
heaven
was
samothrace
the
of
neptune
so
homer
had
appointed
it
and
so
it
was
the
map
was
correct
enough
but
could
not
like
homer
convey
whole
thus
vain
and
false
are
the
mere
human
surmises
and
doubts
which
clash
with
homeric
writ
nobody
whose
mind
had
not
been
reduced
to
the
most
deplorable
logical
condition
could
look
upon
this
beautiful
congruity
betwixt
the
and
the
material
world
and
yet
bear
to
suppose
that
the
poet
may
have
learned
the
features
of
the
coast
from
mere
hearsay
now
then
i
believed
now
i
knew
that
homer
had
along
that
this
vision
of
samothrace
the
nearer
island
was
common
to
him
and
to
me
after
a
journey
of
some
few
days
by
the
route
of
adramiti
and
pergamo
we
reached
smyrna
the
letters
which
methley
here
received
obliged
him
to
return
to
england
chapter
v
infidel
smyrna
smyrna
or
giaour
izmir
infidel
smyrna
as
the
mussulmans
call
it
is
the
main
point
of
commercial
contact
betwixt
europe
and
asia
you
are
there
surrounded
by
the
people
and
the
confused
customs
of
many
and
various
nations
you
see
the
fussy
european
adopting
the
east
and
calming
his
restlessness
with
the
long
turkish
pipe
of
tranquillity
you
see
jews
offering
services
and
receiving
blows
on
one
side
you
have
a
fellow
whose
dress
and
beard
would
give
you
a
good
idea
of
the
true
oriental
if
it
were
not
for
the
of
countenance
with
which
he
is
swallowing
an
article
in
the
and
there
just
by
is
a
genuine
osmanlee
smoking
away
with
all
the
majesty
of
a
sultan
but
before
you
have
time
to
admire
sufficiently
his
tranquil
dignity
and
his
soft
asiatic
repose
the
poor
old
fellow
is
ruthlessly
run
down
by
an
english
midshipman
who
had
set
sail
on
a
smyrna
hack
such
are
the
incongruities
of
the
infidel
city
at
ordinary
times
but
when
i
was
there
our
friend
carrigaholt
had
imported
himself
and
his
oddities
as
an
accession
to
the
other
and
inferior
wonders
of
smyrna
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
room
one
day
at
constantinople
when
i
heard
methley
approaching
my
door
with
shouts
of
laughter
and
welcome
and
presently
i
recognised
that
peculiar
cry
by
which
our
friend
carrigaholt
expresses
his
emotions
he
soon
explained
to
us
the
final
causes
by
which
the
fates
had
worked
out
their
wonderful
purpose
of
bringing
him
to
constantinople
he
was
always
you
know
very
fond
of
sailing
but
he
had
got
into
such
sad
scrapes
including
i
think
a
lawsuit
on
account
of
his
last
yacht
that
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
have
a
cruise
in
a
merchant
vessel
so
he
went
to
liverpool
and
looked
through
the
craft
lying
ready
to
sail
till
he
found
a
smart
schooner
that
perfectly
suited
his
taste
the
destination
of
the
vessel
was
the
last
thing
he
thought
of
and
when
he
was
told
that
she
was
bound
for
constantinople
he
merely
assented
to
that
as
a
part
of
the
arrangement
to
which
he
had
no
objection
as
soon
as
the
vessel
had
sailed
the
hapless
passenger
discovered
that
his
skipper
carried
on
board
an
enormous
wife
with
an
inquiring
mind
and
an
irresistible
tendency
to
impart
her
opinions
she
looked
upon
her
guest
as
upon
a
piece
of
waste
intellect
that
ought
to
be
carefully
tilled
she
tilled
him
accordingly
if
the
dons
at
oxford
could
have
seen
poor
carrigaholt
thus
absolutely
attending
lectures
in
the
bay
of
biscay
they
would
surely
have
thought
him
sufficiently
punished
for
all
the
wrongs
he
did
them
whilst
he
was
preparing
himself
under
their
care
for
the
other
and
more
boisterous
university
the
voyage
did
not
last
more
than
six
or
eight
weeks
and
the
philosophy
inflicted
on
carrigaholt
was
not
entirely
fatal
to
him
certainly
he
was
somewhat
emaciated
and
for
aught
i
know
he
may
have
subscribed
somewhat
too
largely
to
the
society
but
it
did
not
appear
that
his
health
had
been
seriously
affected
there
was
a
scheme
on
foot
it
would
seem
for
taking
the
passenger
back
to
england
in
the
same
scheme
in
fact
for
keeping
him
perpetually
afloat
and
perpetually
saturated
with
arguments
but
when
carrigaholt
found
himself
ashore
and
remembered
that
the
skipperina
who
had
imprudently
remained
on
board
was
not
there
to
enforce
her
suggestions
he
was
open
to
the
hints
of
his
servant
a
very
sharp
fellow
who
arranged
a
plan
for
escaping
and
finally
brought
off
his
master
to
giuseppini
s
hotel
our
friend
afterwards
went
by
sea
to
smyrna
and
there
he
now
was
in
his
glory
he
had
a
good
or
at
all
events
a
judgment
in
matters
of
taste
and
as
his
great
object
was
to
surround
himself
with
all
that
his
fancy
could
dictate
he
lived
in
a
state
of
perpetual
negotiation
he
was
for
ever
on
the
point
of
purchasing
not
only
the
material
productions
of
the
place
but
all
sorts
of
such
fine
ware
as
intelligence
fidelity
and
so
on
he
was
most
curious
however
as
the
purchaser
of
the
sometimes
he
would
imagine
that
he
had
a
marital
aptitude
and
his
fancy
would
sketch
a
graceful
picture
in
which
he
appeared
reclining
on
a
divan
with
a
beautiful
greek
woman
fondly
couched
at
his
feet
and
soothing
him
with
the
witchery
of
her
guitar
having
satisfied
himself
with
the
ideal
picture
thus
created
he
would
pass
into
action
the
guitar
he
would
buy
instantly
and
would
give
such
intimations
of
his
wish
to
be
wedded
to
a
greek
as
could
not
fail
to
produce
great
excitement
in
the
families
of
the
beautiful
smyrniotes
then
again
and
just
in
time
perhaps
to
save
him
from
the
yoke
his
dream
would
pass
away
and
another
would
come
in
its
stead
he
would
suddenly
feel
the
yearnings
of
a
father
s
love
and
willing
by
force
of
gold
to
transcend
all
natural
preliminaries
he
would
issue
instructions
for
the
purchase
of
some
dutiful
child
that
could
be
warranted
to
love
him
as
a
parent
then
at
another
time
he
would
be
convinced
that
the
attachment
of
menials
might
satisfy
the
longings
of
his
affectionate
heart
and
thereupon
he
would
give
orders
to
his
for
something
in
the
way
of
eternal
fidelity
you
may
well
imagine
that
this
anxiety
of
carrigaholt
to
purchase
not
only
the
scenery
but
the
many
belonging
to
his
dreams
with
all
their
goodness
and
graces
complete
necessarily
gave
an
immense
stimulus
to
the
trade
and
intrigue
of
smyrna
and
created
a
demand
for
human
virtues
which
the
moral
resources
of
the
place
were
totally
inadequate
to
supply
every
day
after
breakfast
this
lover
of
the
good
and
the
beautiful
held
a
levee
which
was
often
exceedingly
amusing
in
his
there
would
be
not
only
the
sellers
of
pipes
and
slippers
and
shawls
and
suchlike
oriental
merchandise
not
only
embroiderers
and
cunning
workmen
patiently
striving
to
realise
his
visions
of
albanian
dresses
not
only
the
servants
offering
for
places
and
the
tendering
his
sable
ware
but
there
would
be
the
greek
master
waiting
to
teach
his
pupil
the
grammar
of
the
soft
ionian
tongue
in
which
he
was
to
delight
the
wife
of
his
imagination
and
the
who
was
to
teach
him
some
sweet
replies
to
the
anticipated
sounds
of
the
fancied
guitar
and
then
above
all
and
proudly
eminent
with
undisputed
preference
of
and
fraught
with
the
mysterious
tidings
on
which
the
realisation
of
the
whole
dream
might
depend
was
the
mysterious
enticing
and
postponing
the
suitor
yet
ever
keeping
alive
in
his
soul
the
love
of
that
pictured
virtue
whose
beauty
unseen
by
eyes
was
half
revealed
to
the
imagination
you
would
have
thought
that
this
practical
dreaming
must
have
soon
brought
carrigaholt
to
a
bad
end
but
he
was
in
much
less
danger
than
you
would
suppose
for
besides
that
the
new
visions
of
happiness
almost
always
came
in
time
to
counteract
the
fatal
completion
of
the
preceding
scheme
his
high
breeding
and
his
delicately
sensitive
taste
almost
always
came
to
his
aid
at
times
when
he
was
left
without
any
other
protection
and
the
efficacy
of
these
qualities
in
keeping
a
man
out
of
harm
s
way
is
really
immense
in
all
baseness
and
imposture
there
is
a
coarse
vulgar
spirit
which
however
artfully
concealed
for
a
time
must
sooner
or
later
show
itself
in
some
little
circumstance
sufficiently
plain
to
occasion
an
instant
jar
upon
the
minds
of
those
whose
taste
is
lively
and
true
to
such
men
a
shock
of
this
kind
disclosing
the
of
a
cheat
is
more
effectively
convincing
than
any
mere
proofs
could
be
thus
guarded
from
isle
to
isle
and
through
greece
and
through
albania
this
practical
plato
with
a
purse
in
his
hand
carried
on
his
mad
chase
after
the
good
and
the
beautiful
and
yet
returned
in
safety
to
his
home
but
now
poor
fellow
the
lowly
grave
that
is
the
end
of
men
s
romantic
hopes
has
closed
over
all
his
rich
fancies
and
all
his
high
aspirations
he
is
utterly
married
no
more
hope
no
more
change
for
more
must
go
on
to
the
appointed
end
of
his
journey
smyrna
i
think
may
be
called
the
chief
town
and
capital
of
the
grecian
race
against
which
you
will
be
cautioned
so
carefully
as
soon
as
you
touch
the
levant
you
will
say
that
i
ought
not
to
confound
as
one
people
the
greeks
living
under
a
constitutional
government
with
the
unfortunate
rayahs
who
groan
under
the
turkish
yoke
but
i
can
t
see
that
political
events
have
hitherto
produced
any
strongly
marked
difference
of
character
if
i
could
venture
to
rely
which
i
feel
that
i
can
not
at
all
do
upon
my
own
observation
i
should
tell
you
that
there
was
more
heartiness
and
strength
in
the
greeks
of
the
ottoman
empire
than
in
those
of
the
new
kingdom
the
truth
is
that
there
is
a
greater
field
for
commercial
enterprise
and
even
for
greek
ambition
under
the
ottoman
sceptre
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
dominions
of
otho
indeed
the
people
by
their
frequent
migrations
from
the
limits
of
the
constitutional
kingdom
to
the
territories
of
the
porte
seem
to
show
that
on
the
whole
they
prefer
groaning
under
the
turkish
yoke
to
the
honour
of
being
the
only
true
source
of
legitimate
power
in
their
own
land
for
myself
i
love
the
race
in
spite
of
all
their
vices
and
even
in
spite
of
all
their
meannesses
i
remember
the
blood
that
is
in
them
and
still
love
the
greeks
the
osmanlees
are
of
course
by
nature
by
religion
and
by
politics
the
strong
foes
of
the
hellenic
people
and
as
the
greeks
poor
fellows
happen
to
be
a
little
deficient
in
some
of
the
virtues
which
facilitate
the
transaction
of
commercial
business
such
as
veracity
fidelity
etc
it
naturally
follows
that
they
are
highly
unpopular
with
the
european
merchants
now
these
are
the
persons
through
whom
either
directly
or
indirectly
is
derived
the
greater
part
of
the
information
which
you
gather
in
the
levant
and
therefore
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
hear
an
almost
universal
and
unbroken
testimony
against
the
character
of
the
people
whose
ancestors
invented
virtue
and
strange
to
say
the
greeks
themselves
do
not
attempt
to
disturb
this
general
unanimity
of
opinion
by
any
dissent
on
their
part
question
a
greek
on
the
subject
and
he
will
tell
you
at
once
that
the
people
are
and
will
then
perhaps
endeavour
to
shake
off
his
fair
share
of
the
imputation
by
asserting
that
his
father
had
been
dragoman
to
some
foreign
embassy
and
that
he
the
son
therefore
by
the
law
of
nations
had
ceased
to
be
greek
e
dunque
no
siete
traditore
possibile
signor
ma
almeno
io
no
sono
not
even
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
hellenic
kingdom
are
free
from
the
habit
of
depreciating
their
brethren
i
recollect
that
at
one
of
the
ports
in
syria
a
greek
vessel
was
rather
unfairly
kept
in
quarantine
by
order
of
the
board
of
health
which
consisted
entirely
of
europeans
a
consular
agent
from
the
kingdom
of
greece
had
lately
hoisted
his
flag
in
the
town
and
the
captain
of
the
vessel
drew
up
a
remonstrance
which
he
requested
his
consul
to
present
to
the
board
now
this
reasonable
said
the
consul
is
it
reasonable
that
i
should
place
myself
in
collision
with
all
the
principal
european
gentlemen
of
the
place
for
the
sake
of
you
a
greek
the
skipper
was
greatly
vexed
at
the
failure
of
his
application
but
he
scarcely
even
questioned
the
justice
of
the
ground
which
his
consul
had
taken
well
it
happened
some
time
afterwards
that
i
found
myself
at
the
same
port
having
gone
thither
with
the
view
of
embarking
for
the
port
of
syra
i
was
anxious
of
course
to
elude
as
carefully
as
possible
the
quarantine
detentions
which
threatened
me
on
my
arrival
and
hearing
that
the
greek
consul
had
a
brother
who
was
a
man
in
authority
at
syra
i
got
myself
presented
to
the
former
and
took
the
liberty
of
asking
him
to
give
me
such
a
letter
of
introduction
to
his
relative
at
syra
as
might
possibly
have
the
effect
of
shortening
the
term
of
my
quarantine
he
acceded
to
this
request
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
courtesy
but
when
he
replied
to
my
thanks
by
saying
that
in
serving
an
englishman
he
was
doing
no
more
than
his
strict
duty
commanded
not
even
my
gratitude
could
prevent
me
from
calling
to
mind
his
treatment
of
the
poor
captain
who
had
the
misfortune
of
not
being
an
alien
in
blood
to
his
consul
and
appointed
protector
i
think
that
the
change
which
has
taken
place
in
the
character
of
the
greeks
has
been
occasioned
in
great
measure
by
the
doctrines
and
practice
of
their
religion
the
greek
church
has
animated
the
muscovite
peasant
and
inspired
him
with
hopes
and
ideas
which
however
humble
are
still
better
than
none
at
all
but
the
faith
and
the
forms
and
the
strange
ecclesiastical
literature
which
act
so
advantageously
upon
the
mere
clay
of
the
russian
serf
seem
to
hang
like
lead
upon
the
ethereal
spirit
of
the
greek
never
in
any
part
of
the
world
have
i
seen
religious
performances
so
painful
to
witness
as
those
of
the
greeks
the
horror
however
with
which
one
shudders
at
their
worship
is
attributable
in
some
measure
to
the
mere
effect
of
costume
in
all
the
ottoman
dominions
and
very
frequently
too
in
the
kingdom
of
otho
the
greeks
wear
turbans
or
other
and
shave
their
heads
leaving
only
a
rat
at
the
crown
of
the
head
they
of
course
keep
themselves
covered
within
doors
as
well
as
abroad
and
they
never
remove
their
headgear
merely
on
account
of
being
in
a
church
but
when
the
greek
stops
to
worship
at
his
proper
shrine
then
and
then
only
he
always
uncovers
and
as
you
see
him
thus
with
shaven
skull
and
savage
tail
depending
from
his
crown
kissing
a
thing
of
wood
and
glass
and
cringing
with
base
prostrations
and
apparent
terror
before
a
miserable
picture
you
see
superstition
in
a
shape
which
outwardly
at
least
is
sadly
abject
and
repulsive
the
fasts
too
of
the
greek
church
produce
an
ill
effect
upon
the
character
of
the
people
for
they
are
not
a
mere
farce
but
are
carried
to
such
an
extent
as
to
bring
about
a
real
mortification
of
the
flesh
the
febrile
irritation
of
the
frame
operating
in
conjunction
with
the
depression
of
the
spirits
occasioned
by
abstinence
will
so
far
answer
the
objects
of
the
rite
as
to
engender
some
religious
excitement
but
this
is
of
a
morbid
and
gloomy
character
and
it
seems
to
be
certain
that
along
with
the
increase
of
sanctity
there
comes
a
fiercer
desire
for
the
perpetration
of
dark
crimes
the
number
of
murders
committed
during
lent
is
greater
i
am
told
than
at
any
other
time
of
the
year
a
man
under
the
influence
of
a
bean
dietary
for
this
is
the
principal
food
of
the
greeks
during
their
fasts
will
be
in
an
apt
humour
for
enriching
the
shrine
of
his
saint
and
passing
a
knife
through
his
neighbour
the
moneys
deposited
upon
the
shrines
are
appropriated
by
priests
the
priests
are
married
men
and
have
families
to
provide
for
they
take
the
good
with
the
bad
and
continue
to
recommend
fasts
then
too
the
greek
church
enjoins
her
followers
to
keep
holy
such
a
vast
number
of
saints
days
as
practically
to
shorten
the
lives
of
the
people
very
materially
i
believe
that
out
of
the
number
of
days
in
the
year
are
kept
holy
or
rather
in
honour
of
the
saints
no
great
portion
of
the
time
thus
set
apart
is
spent
in
religious
exercises
and
the
people
don
t
betake
themselves
to
any
such
animating
pastimes
as
might
serve
to
strengthen
the
frame
or
invigorate
the
mind
or
exalt
the
taste
on
the
contrary
the
saints
days
of
the
greeks
in
smyrna
are
passed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
sabbaths
of
protestant
housemaids
in
is
to
say
in
a
steady
and
serious
contemplation
of
street
scenery
the
men
perform
this
duty
the
of
their
houses
the
women
the
which
the
custom
of
greek
towns
has
so
decidedly
appropriated
to
them
as
the
proper
station
of
their
sex
that
a
man
would
be
looked
upon
as
utterly
effeminate
if
he
ventured
to
choose
that
situation
for
the
keeping
of
the
saints
days
i
was
present
one
day
at
a
treaty
for
the
hire
of
some
apartments
at
smyrna
which
was
carried
on
between
carrigaholt
and
the
greek
woman
to
whom
the
rooms
belonged
carrigaholt
objected
that
the
windows
commanded
no
view
of
the
street
immediately
the
brow
of
the
majestic
matron
clouded
and
with
all
the
scorn
of
a
spartan
mother
she
coolly
asked
carrigaholt
and
said
art
thou
a
tender
damsel
that
thou
wouldst
sit
and
gaze
from
windows
the
man
whom
she
addressed
however
had
not
gone
to
greece
with
any
intention
of
placing
himself
under
the
laws
of
lycurgus
and
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
views
by
a
spartan
rebuke
so
he
took
care
to
find
himself
windows
after
his
own
heart
and
there
i
believe
for
many
a
month
he
kept
the
saints
days
and
all
the
days
intervening
after
the
fashion
of
grecian
women
oh
let
me
be
charitable
to
all
who
write
and
to
all
who
lecture
and
to
all
who
preach
since
even
i
a
layman
not
forced
to
write
at
all
can
hardly
avoid
chiming
in
with
some
tuneful
cant
i
have
had
the
heart
to
talk
about
the
pernicious
effects
of
the
greek
holidays
to
which
i
owe
some
of
my
most
beautiful
visions
i
will
let
the
words
stand
as
a
humbling
proof
that
i
am
subject
to
that
immutable
law
which
compels
a
man
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
to
be
uttering
every
now
and
then
some
sentiment
not
his
own
it
seems
as
though
the
power
of
expressing
regrets
and
desires
by
written
symbols
were
coupled
with
a
condition
that
the
writer
should
from
time
to
time
express
the
regrets
and
desires
of
other
people
as
though
like
a
french
peasant
under
the
old
régime
one
were
bound
to
perform
a
certain
amount
of
work
the
public
i
rebel
as
stoutly
as
i
can
against
this
horrible
i
try
not
to
deceive
try
to
set
down
the
thoughts
which
are
fresh
within
me
and
not
to
pretend
any
wishes
or
griefs
which
i
do
not
really
feel
but
no
sooner
do
i
cease
from
watchfulness
in
this
regard
than
my
right
hand
is
as
it
were
seized
by
some
false
angel
and
even
now
you
see
i
have
been
forced
to
put
down
such
words
and
sentences
as
i
ought
to
have
written
if
really
and
truly
i
had
wished
to
disturb
the
saints
days
of
the
beautiful
smyrniotes
which
heaven
forbid
for
as
you
move
through
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
at
these
times
of
festival
the
windows
suspended
over
your
head
on
either
side
are
filled
with
the
beautiful
descendants
of
the
old
ionian
race
all
even
yonder
empress
that
sits
throned
at
the
window
of
that
humblest
mud
cottage
are
attired
with
seeming
magnificence
their
classic
heads
are
crowned
with
scarlet
and
loaded
with
jewels
or
coins
of
gold
the
whole
wealth
of
the
wearer
their
features
are
touched
with
a
savage
pencil
which
hardens
the
outline
of
eyes
and
eyebrows
and
lends
an
unnatural
fire
to
the
stern
grave
looks
with
which
they
pierce
your
brain
endure
their
fiery
eyes
as
best
you
may
and
ride
on
slowly
and
reverently
for
facing
you
from
the
side
of
the
transom
that
looks
longwise
through
the
street
you
see
the
one
glorious
shape
transcendent
in
its
beauty
you
see
the
massive
braid
of
hair
as
it
catches
a
touch
of
light
on
its
jetty
surface
and
the
broad
calm
angry
brow
the
large
black
eyes
deep
set
and
like
the
eyes
of
a
conqueror
with
their
rich
shadows
of
thought
lying
darkly
around
them
you
see
the
thin
fiery
nostril
and
the
bold
line
of
the
chin
and
throat
disclosing
all
the
fierceness
and
all
the
pride
passion
and
power
that
can
live
along
with
the
rare
womanly
beauty
of
those
sweetly
turned
lips
but
then
there
is
a
terrible
stillness
in
this
breathing
image
it
seems
like
the
stillness
of
a
savage
that
sits
intent
and
brooding
day
by
day
upon
some
one
fearful
scheme
of
vengeance
but
yet
more
like
it
seems
to
the
stillness
of
an
immortal
whose
will
must
be
known
and
obeyed
without
sign
or
speech
bow
down
down
and
adore
the
young

chapter
vi
greek
mariners
i
sailed
from
smyrna
in
the
a
greek
brigantine
which
was
confidently
said
to
be
bound
for
the
coast
of
syria
but
i
knew
that
this
announcement
was
not
to
be
relied
upon
with
positive
certainty
for
the
greek
mariners
are
practically
free
from
the
stringency
of
ship
s
papers
and
where
they
will
there
they
go
however
i
had
the
whole
of
the
cabin
for
myself
and
my
attendant
mysseri
subject
only
to
the
society
of
the
captain
at
the
hour
of
dinner
being
at
ease
in
this
respect
being
furnished
too
with
plenty
of
books
and
finding
an
unfailing
source
of
interest
in
the
thorough
greekness
of
my
captain
and
my
crew
i
felt
less
anxious
than
most
people
would
have
been
about
the
probable
length
of
the
cruise
i
knew
enough
of
greek
navigation
to
be
sure
that
our
vessel
would
cling
to
earth
like
a
child
to
its
mother
s
knee
and
that
i
should
touch
at
many
an
isle
before
i
set
foot
upon
the
syrian
coast
but
i
had
no
invidious
preference
for
europe
asia
or
africa
and
i
felt
that
i
could
defy
the
winds
to
blow
me
upon
a
coast
that
was
blank
and
void
of
interest
my
patience
was
extremely
useful
to
me
for
the
cruise
altogether
endured
some
forty
days
and
that
in
the
midst
of
winter
according
to
me
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
greeks
male
greeks
are
the
mariners
because
their
pursuits
and
their
social
condition
are
so
nearly
the
same
as
those
of
their
famous
ancestors
you
will
say
that
the
occupation
of
commerce
must
have
smoothed
down
the
salience
of
their
minds
and
this
would
be
so
perhaps
if
their
mercantile
affairs
were
conducted
according
to
the
fixed
routine
of
europeans
but
the
ventures
of
the
greeks
are
surrounded
by
such
a
multitude
of
imagined
dangers
and
from
the
absence
of
regular
marts
in
which
the
true
value
of
merchandise
can
be
ascertained
are
so
entirely
speculative
and
besides
are
conducted
in
a
manner
so
wholly
determined
upon
by
the
wayward
fancies
and
wishes
of
the
crew
that
they
belong
to
enterprise
rather
than
to
industry
and
are
very
far
indeed
from
tending
to
deaden
any
freshness
of
character
the
vessels
in
which
war
and
piracy
were
carried
on
during
the
years
of
the
greek
revolution
became
merchantmen
at
the
end
of
the
war
but
the
tactics
of
the
greeks
as
naval
warriors
were
so
exceedingly
cautious
and
their
habits
as
commercial
mariners
are
so
wild
that
the
change
has
been
more
slight
than
you
might
imagine
the
first
care
of
greeks
greek
rayahs
when
they
undertake
a
shipping
enterprise
is
to
procure
for
their
vessel
the
protection
of
some
european
power
this
is
easily
managed
by
a
little
intriguing
with
the
dragoman
of
one
of
the
embassies
at
constantinople
and
the
craft
soon
glories
in
the
ensign
of
russia
or
the
dazzling
tricolor
or
the
union
jack
thus
to
the
great
delight
of
her
crew
she
enters
upon
the
ocean
world
with
a
flaring
lie
at
her
peak
but
the
appearance
of
the
vessel
does
no
discredit
to
the
borrowed
flag
she
is
frail
indeed
but
is
gracefully
built
and
smartly
rigged
she
always
carries
guns
and
in
short
gives
good
promise
of
mischief
and
speed
the
privileges
attached
to
the
vessel
and
her
crew
by
virtue
of
the
borrowed
flag
are
so
great
as
to
imply
a
liberty
wider
even
than
that
which
is
often
enjoyed
in
our
more
strictly
civilised
countries
so
that
there
is
no
pretence
for
saying
that
the
development
of
the
true
character
belonging
to
greek
mariners
is
prevented
by
the
dominion
of
the
ottoman
these
men
are
free
too
from
the
power
of
the
great
capitalist
whose
sway
is
more
withering
than
despotism
itself
to
the
enterprises
of
humble
venturers
the
capital
employed
is
supplied
by
those
whose
labour
is
to
render
it
productive
the
crew
receive
no
wages
but
have
all
a
share
in
the
venture
and
in
general
i
believe
they
are
the
owners
of
the
whole
freight
they
choose
a
captain
to
whom
they
entrust
just
power
enough
to
keep
the
vessel
on
her
course
in
fine
weather
but
not
quite
enough
for
a
gale
of
wind
they
also
elect
a
cook
and
a
mate
the
cook
whom
we
had
on
board
was
particularly
careful
about
the
ship
s
reckoning
and
when
under
the
influence
of
the
keen
we
grew
fondly
expectant
of
an
instant
dinner
the
great
author
of
would
be
standing
on
deck
with
an
ancient
quadrant
in
his
hands
calmly
affecting
to
take
an
observation
but
then
to
make
up
for
this
the
captain
would
be
exercising
a
controlling
influence
over
the
soup
so
that
all
in
the
end
went
well
our
mate
was
a
hydriot
a
native
of
that
island
rock
which
grows
nothing
but
mariners
and
mariners
wives
his
character
seemed
to
be
exactly
that
which
is
generally
attributed
to
the
hydriot
race
he
was
fierce
and
gloomy
and
lonely
in
his
ways
one
of
his
principal
duties
seemed
to
be
that
of
acting
as
or
leader
of
the
opposition
denouncing
the
first
symptoms
of
tyranny
and
protecting
even
the
from
oppression
besides
this
when
things
went
smoothly
he
would
begin
to
prognosticate
evil
in
order
that
his
more
lighthearted
comrades
might
not
be
puffed
up
with
the
seeming
good
fortune
of
the
moment
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
personal
freedom
of
these
sailors
who
own
no
superiors
except
those
of
their
own
choice
is
as
like
as
may
be
to
that
of
their
seafaring
ancestors
and
even
in
their
mode
of
navigation
they
have
admitted
no
such
an
entire
change
as
you
would
suppose
probable
it
is
true
that
they
have
so
far
availed
themselves
of
modern
discoveries
as
to
look
to
the
compass
instead
of
the
stars
and
that
they
have
superseded
the
immortal
gods
of
their
forefathers
by
nicholas
in
his
glass
case
but
they
are
not
yet
so
confident
either
in
their
needle
or
their
saint
as
to
love
an
open
sea
and
they
still
hug
their
shores
as
fondly
as
the
argonauts
of
old
indeed
they
have
a
most
love
for
the
land
and
i
really
believe
that
in
a
gale
of
wind
they
would
rather
have
a
coast
on
their
lee
than
no
coast
at
all
according
to
the
notions
of
an
english
seaman
this
kind
of
navigation
would
soon
bring
the
vessel
on
which
it
might
be
practised
to
an
evil
end
the
greek
however
is
unaccountably
successful
in
escaping
the
consequences
of
being
jammed
in
as
it
is
called
upon
a
these
seamen
like
their
forefathers
rely
upon
no
winds
unless
they
are
right
astern
or
on
the
quarter
they
rarely
go
a
wind
if
it
blows
at
all
fresh
and
if
the
adverse
breeze
approaches
to
a
gale
they
at
once
fumigate
nicholas
and
put
up
the
helm
the
consequence
of
course
is
that
under
the
winds
of
the
ægean
they
are
blown
about
in
the
most
whimsical
manner
i
used
to
think
that
ulysses
with
his
ten
years
voyage
had
taken
his
time
in
making
ithaca
but
my
experience
in
greek
navigation
soon
made
me
understand
that
he
had
had
in
point
of
fact
a
pretty
good
average
such
are
now
the
mariners
of
the
ægean
free
equal
amongst
themselves
navigating
the
seas
of
their
forefathers
with
the
same
heroic
and
yet
childlike
spirit
of
venture
the
same
reliance
upon
heavenly
aid
they
are
the
liveliest
images
of
true
old
greeks
that
time
and
the
new
religions
have
spared
to
us
with
one
exception
our
crew
were
a
solemn
company
and
yet
sometimes
when
all
things
went
well
they
would
relax
their
austerity
and
show
a
disposition
to
fun
or
rather
to
quiet
humour
when
this
happened
they
invariably
had
recourse
to
one
of
their
number
who
went
by
the
name
of
admiral
he
was
an
amusing
fellow
the
poorest
i
believe
and
the
least
thoughtful
of
the
crew
but
full
of
rich
humour
his
story
of
the
events
by
which
he
had
gained
the
sobriquet
of
admiral
never
failed
to
delight
his
hearers
and
when
he
was
desired
to
repeat
it
for
my
benefit
the
rest
of
the
crew
crowded
round
with
as
much
interest
as
if
they
were
listening
to
the
tale
for
the
first
time
a
number
of
greek
brigs
and
brigantines
were
at
anchor
in
the
bay
of
beyrout
a
festival
of
some
kind
particularly
attractive
to
the
sailors
was
going
on
in
the
town
and
whether
with
or
without
leave
i
know
not
but
the
crews
of
all
the
craft
except
that
of
nicolou
had
gone
ashore
on
board
his
vessel
however
which
carried
dollars
there
was
it
would
seem
a
more
careful
or
more
influential
captain
who
was
able
to
enforce
his
determination
that
one
man
at
least
should
be
left
on
board
nicolou
s
good
nature
was
with
him
so
powerful
an
impulse
that
he
could
not
resist
the
delight
of
volunteering
to
stay
with
the
vessel
whilst
his
comrades
went
ashore
his
proposal
was
accepted
and
the
crew
and
captain
soon
left
him
alone
on
the
deck
of
his
vessel
the
sailors
gathering
together
from
their
several
ships
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
town
when
suddenly
there
came
down
from
betwixt
the
mountains
one
of
those
sudden
hurricanes
which
sometimes
occur
in
southern
climes
nicolou
s
vessel
together
with
four
of
the
craft
which
had
been
left
unmanned
broke
from
her
moorings
and
all
five
of
the
vessels
were
carried
out
seaward
the
town
is
on
a
salient
point
at
the
southern
side
of
the
bay
so
that
that
admiral
was
close
under
the
eyes
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
sailors
when
he
gallantly
drifted
out
at
the
head
of
his
little
fleet
if
nicolou
could
not
entirely
control
the
manœuvres
of
the
squadron
there
was
at
least
no
human
power
to
divide
his
authority
and
thus
it
was
that
he
took
rank
as
nicolou
cut
his
cable
and
thus
for
the
time
saved
his
vessel
for
the
rest
of
the
fleet
under
his
command
were
quickly
wrecked
whilst
the
admiral
got
away
clear
to
the
open
sea
the
violence
of
the
squall
soon
passed
off
but
nicolou
felt
that
his
chance
of
one
day
resigning
his
high
duties
as
an
admiral
for
the
enjoyments
of
private
life
on
the
steadfast
shore
mainly
depended
upon
his
success
in
working
the
brig
with
his
own
hands
so
after
calling
on
his
namesake
the
saint
not
for
the
first
time
i
take
it
he
got
up
some
canvas
and
took
the
helm
he
became
equal
he
told
us
to
a
score
of
nicolous
and
the
vessel
as
he
said
was
manned
with
his
for
two
days
it
seems
he
cruised
at
large
but
at
last
either
by
his
seamanship
or
by
the
natural
instinct
of
the
greek
mariners
for
finding
land
he
brought
his
craft
close
to
an
unknown
shore
that
promised
well
for
his
purpose
of
running
in
the
vessel
and
he
was
preparing
to
give
her
a
good
berth
on
the
beach
when
he
saw
a
gang
of
fellows
coming
down
to
the
point
for
which
he
was
making
poor
nicolou
was
a
perfectly
unlettered
and
untutored
genius
and
for
that
reason
perhaps
a
keen
listener
to
tales
of
terror
his
mind
had
been
impressed
with
some
horrible
legend
of
cannibalism
and
he
now
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
the
men
awaiting
him
on
the
beach
were
the
monsters
at
whom
he
had
shuddered
in
the
days
of
his
childhood
the
coast
on
which
nicolou
was
running
his
vessel
was
somewhere
i
fancy
at
the
foot
of
the
anzairie
mountains
and
the
fellows
who
were
preparing
to
give
him
a
reception
were
probably
very
rough
specimens
of
humanity
it
is
likely
enough
that
they
might
have
given
themselves
the
trouble
of
putting
the
admiral
to
death
for
the
purpose
of
simplifying
their
claim
to
the
vessel
and
preventing
litigation
but
the
notion
of
their
cannibalism
was
of
course
utterly
unfounded
nicolou
s
terror
had
however
so
graven
the
idea
on
his
mind
that
he
could
never
afterwards
dismiss
it
having
once
determined
the
character
of
his
expectant
hosts
the
admiral
naturally
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
keep
their
dinner
waiting
any
length
of
time
than
to
attend
their
feast
in
the
character
of
a
roasted
greek
so
he
put
about
his
vessel
and
tempted
the
deep
once
more
after
a
further
cruise
the
lonely
commander
ran
his
vessel
upon
some
rocks
at
another
part
of
the
coast
where
she
was
lost
with
all
her
treasures
and
nicolou
was
but
too
glad
to
scramble
ashore
though
without
one
dollar
in
his
girdle
these
adventures
seem
flat
enough
as
i
repeat
them
but
the
hero
expressed
his
terrors
by
such
odd
terms
of
speech
and
such
strangely
humorous
gestures
that
the
story
came
from
his
lips
with
an
unfailing
zest
so
that
the
crew
who
had
heard
the
tale
so
often
could
still
enjoy
to
their
hearts
content
the
rich
fright
of
the
admiral
and
still
shuddered
with
unabated
horror
when
he
came
to
the
loss
of
the
dollars
the
power
of
listening
to
long
stories
for
which
by
the
bye
i
am
giving
you
large
credit
is
common
i
fancy
to
most
sailors
and
the
greeks
have
it
to
a
high
degree
for
they
can
be
perfectly
patient
under
a
narrative
of
two
or
three
hours
duration
these
long
stories
are
mostly
founded
upon
oriental
topics
and
in
one
of
them
i
recognised
with
some
alteration
an
old
friend
of
the
i
inquired
as
to
the
source
from
which
the
story
had
been
derived
and
the
crew
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
handed
down
unwritten
from
greek
to
greek
their
account
of
the
matter
does
not
perhaps
go
very
far
towards
showing
the
real
origin
of
the
tale
but
when
i
afterwards
took
up
the
i
became
strongly
impressed
with
a
notion
that
they
must
have
sprung
from
the
brain
of
a
greek
it
seems
to
me
that
these
stories
whilst
they
disclose
a
complete
and
habitual
knowledge
of
things
asiatic
have
about
them
so
much
of
freshness
and
life
so
much
of
the
stirring
and
volatile
european
character
that
they
can
not
have
owed
their
conception
to
a
mere
oriental
who
for
creative
purposes
is
a
thing
dead
and
mental
mummy
that
may
have
been
a
live
king
just
after
the
flood
but
has
since
lain
balmed
in
spice
at
the
time
of
the
caliphat
the
greek
race
was
familiar
enough
to
baghdad
they
were
the
merchants
the
pedlars
the
barbers
and
of
asia
and
therefore
the
oriental
materials
with
which
the
arabian
tales
were
wrought
must
have
been
completely
at
the
command
of
the
inventive
people
to
whom
i
would
attribute
their
origin
we
were
nearing
the
isle
of
cyprus
when
there
arose
half
a
gale
of
wind
with
a
heavy
chopping
sea
my
greek
seamen
considered
that
the
weather
amounted
not
to
a
half
but
to
an
integral
gale
of
wind
at
the
very
least
so
they
put
up
the
helm
and
scudded
for
twenty
hours
when
we
neared
the
mainland
of
anadoli
the
gale
ceased
and
a
favourable
breeze
sprung
up
which
brought
us
off
cyprus
once
more
afterwards
the
wind
changed
again
but
we
were
still
able
to
lay
our
course
by
sailing
we
were
at
length
in
such
a
position
that
by
holding
on
our
course
for
about
half
an
hour
we
should
get
under
the
lee
of
the
island
and
find
ourselves
in
smooth
water
but
the
wind
had
been
gradually
freshening
it
now
blew
hard
and
there
was
a
heavy
sea
running
as
the
grounds
for
alarm
arose
the
crew
gathered
together
in
one
close
group
they
stood
pale
and
grim
under
their
hooded
capotes
like
monks
awaiting
a
massacre
anxiously
looking
by
turns
along
the
pathway
of
the
storm
and
then
upon
each
other
and
then
upon
the
eye
of
the
captain
who
stood
by
the
helmsman
presently
the
hydriot
came
aft
more
moody
than
ever
the
bearer
of
fierce
remonstrance
against
the
continuing
of
the
struggle
he
received
a
resolute
answer
and
still
we
held
our
course
soon
there
came
a
heavy
sea
that
caught
the
bow
of
the
brigantine
as
she
lay
jammed
in
betwixt
the
waves
she
bowed
her
head
low
under
the
waters
and
shuddered
through
all
her
timbers
then
gallantly
stood
up
again
over
the
striving
sea
with
bowsprit
entire
but
where
were
the
crew
it
was
a
crew
no
longer
but
rather
a
gathering
of
greek
citizens
the
shout
of
the
seamen
was
changed
for
the
murmuring
of
the
spirit
of
the
old
demos
was
alive
the
men
came
aft
in
a
body
and
loudly
asked
that
the
vessel
should
be
put
about
and
that
the
storm
be
no
longer
tempted
now
then
for
speeches
the
captain
his
eyes
flashing
fire
his
frame
all
quivering
with
his
every
limb
like
another
and
a
louder
voice
pours
forth
the
eloquent
torrent
of
his
threats
and
his
reasons
his
commands
and
his
prayers
he
promises
he
vows
he
swears
that
there
is
safety
in
holding
greeks
will
be
the
men
hear
and
are
moved
but
the
gale
rouses
itself
once
more
and
again
the
raging
sea
comes
trampling
over
the
timbers
that
are
the
life
of
all
the
fierce
hydriot
advances
one
step
nearer
to
the
captain
and
the
angry
growl
of
the
people
goes
floating
down
the
wind
but
they
listen
they
waver
once
more
and
once
more
resolve
then
waver
again
thus
doubtfully
hanging
between
the
terrors
of
the
storm
and
the
persuasion
of
glorious
speech
as
though
it
were
the
athenian
that
talked
and
philip
of
macedon
that
thundered
on
the
brave
thoughts
winged
on
grecian
words
gained
their
natural
mastery
over
terror
the
brigantine
held
on
her
course
and
reached
smooth
water
at
last
i
landed
at
limasol
the
westernmost
port
of
cyprus
leaving
the
vessel
to
sail
for
larnaca
where
she
was
to
remain
for
some
days
chapter
vii
cyprus
there
was
a
greek
at
limasol
who
hoisted
his
flag
as
an
english
and
he
insisted
upon
my
accepting
his
hospitality
with
some
difficulty
and
chiefly
by
assuring
him
that
i
could
not
delay
my
departure
beyond
an
early
hour
in
the
afternoon
i
induced
him
to
allow
my
dining
with
his
family
instead
of
banqueting
all
alone
with
the
representative
of
my
sovereign
in
consular
state
and
dignity
the
lady
of
the
house
it
seemed
had
never
sat
at
table
with
a
european
she
was
very
shy
about
the
matter
and
tried
hard
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
but
the
husband
i
fancy
reminded
her
that
she
was
theoretically
an
englishwoman
by
virtue
of
the
flag
that
waved
over
her
roof
and
that
she
was
bound
to
show
her
nationality
by
sitting
at
meat
with
me
finding
herself
inexorably
condemned
to
bear
with
the
dreaded
gaze
of
european
eyes
she
tried
to
save
her
innocent
children
from
the
hard
fate
awaiting
herself
but
i
obtained
that
all
of
them
and
i
think
there
were
four
or
five
should
sit
at
the
table
you
will
meet
with
abundance
of
stately
receptions
and
of
generous
hospitality
too
in
the
east
but
rarely
very
rarely
in
those
regions
or
even
so
far
as
i
know
in
any
part
of
southern
europe
does
one
gain
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
familiar
and
indoor
life
of
the
people
this
family
party
of
the
good
consul
s
or
rather
of
mine
for
i
originated
the
idea
though
he
furnished
the
materials
went
off
very
well
the
mamma
was
shy
at
first
but
she
veiled
the
awkwardness
which
she
felt
by
affecting
to
scold
her
children
who
had
all
of
them
i
think
immortal
too
which
they
owed
to
tradition
and
certainly
not
to
any
classical
enthusiasm
of
their
parents
every
instant
i
was
delighted
by
some
such
phrases
as
these
themistocles
my
love
don
t
alcibiades
can
t
you
sit
still
socrates
put
down
the
oh
fie
aspasia
don
t
oh
don
t
be
naughty
it
is
true
that
the
names
were
pronounced
socrāhtie
is
according
to
accent
and
not
according
to
i
suppose
it
is
scarcely
now
to
be
doubted
that
they
were
so
sounded
in
ancient
times
to
me
it
seems
that
of
all
the
lands
i
know
you
will
see
in
a
minute
how
i
connect
this
piece
of
prose
with
the
isle
of
cyprus
there
is
none
in
which
mere
wealth
mere
unaided
wealth
is
held
half
so
cheaply
none
in
which
a
poor
devil
of
a
millionaire
without
birth
or
ability
occupies
so
humble
a
place
as
in
england
my
greek
host
and
i
were
sitting
together
i
think
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
for
that
is
the
in
eastern
climes
when
the
former
assumed
a
serious
air
and
intimated
a
wish
to
converse
upon
the
subject
of
the
british
constitution
with
which
he
assured
me
that
he
was
thoroughly
acquainted
he
presently
however
informed
me
that
there
was
one
anomalous
circumstance
attended
upon
the
practical
working
of
our
political
system
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
hear
explained
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
himself
from
the
fact
of
his
having
found
a
difficulty
in
his
subject
i
began
to
think
that
my
host
might
really
know
rather
more
of
it
than
his
announcement
of
a
thorough
knowledge
had
led
me
to
expect
i
felt
interested
at
being
about
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
an
intelligent
greek
quite
remote
from
the
influence
of
european
opinions
what
might
seem
to
him
the
most
astonishing
and
incomprehensible
of
all
those
results
which
have
followed
from
the
action
of
our
political
institutions
the
anomaly
the
only
anomaly
which
had
been
detected
by
the
wisdom
consisted
in
the
fact
that
rothschild
the
late
had
never
been
the
prime
minister
of
england
i
gravely
tried
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
mysterious
causes
that
had
kept
the
worthy
israelite
out
of
the
cabinet
but
i
think
i
could
see
that
my
explanation
was
not
satisfactory
go
and
argue
with
the
flies
of
summer
that
there
is
a
power
divine
yet
greater
than
the
sun
in
the
heavens
but
never
dare
hope
to
convince
the
people
of
the
south
that
there
is
any
other
god
than
gold
my
intended
journey
was
to
the
site
of
the
paphian
temple
i
take
no
antiquarian
interest
in
ruins
and
care
little
about
them
unless
they
are
either
striking
in
themselves
or
else
serve
to
mark
some
spot
on
which
my
fancy
loves
to
dwell
i
knew
that
the
ruins
of
paphos
were
scarcely
if
at
all
discernible
but
there
was
a
will
and
a
longing
more
imperious
than
mere
curiosity
that
drove
me
thither
for
this
just
then
was
my
pagan
soul
s
not
forfeiting
my
inheritance
for
the
life
to
come
it
had
yet
been
given
me
to
live
through
this
world
to
live
a
favoured
mortal
under
the
old
olympian
speak
out
my
resolves
to
the
listening
jove
and
hear
him
answer
with
approving
be
blessed
with
divine
councils
from
the
lips
of
pallas
only
to
believe
for
one
rapturous
moment
that
in
the
gloomy
depths
of
the
grove
by
the
mountain
s
side
there
were
some
leafy
pathway
that
crisped
beneath
the
glowing
sandal
of
not
coldly
disdainful
of
even
a
mortal
s
love
and
this
vain
heathenish
longing
of
mine
was
father
to
the
thought
of
visiting
the
scene
of
the
ancient
worship
the
isle
is
beautiful
from
the
edge
of
the
rich
flowery
fields
on
which
i
trod
to
the
midway
sides
of
the
snowy
olympus
the
ground
could
only
here
and
there
show
an
abrupt
crag
or
a
high
straggling
ridge
that
itself
from
out
of
the
wilderness
of
myrtles
and
of
the
thousand
shrubs
that
twined
their
arms
together
in
lovesome
tangles
the
air
that
came
to
my
lips
was
warm
and
fragrant
as
the
ambrosial
breath
of
the
goddess
infecting
me
not
of
course
with
a
faith
in
the
old
religion
of
the
isle
but
with
a
sense
and
apprehension
of
its
mystic
power
that
was
still
to
be
by
for
why
otherwise
did
i
toil
on
with
sorry
horses
to
where
for
her
the
hundred
altars
glowed
with
arabian
incense
and
breathed
with
the
fragrance
of
garlands
ever
fresh
i
passed
a
sadly
disenchanting
night
in
the
cabin
of
a
greek
a
priest
of
the
goddess
but
of
the
greek
church
there
was
but
one
humble
room
or
rather
shed
for
man
and
priest
and
beast
the
next
morning
i
reached
baffa
paphos
a
village
not
far
distant
from
the
site
of
the
temple
there
was
a
greek
husbandman
there
who
not
for
emolument
but
for
the
sake
of
the
protection
and
dignity
which
it
afforded
had
got
leave
from
the
man
at
limasol
to
hoist
his
flag
as
a
sort
of
of
the
british
sovereign
the
poor
fellow
instantly
changed
his
greek
headgear
for
the
cap
of
consular
dignity
and
insisted
upon
accompanying
me
to
the
ruins
i
would
not
have
stood
this
if
i
could
have
felt
the
faintest
gleam
of
my
yesterday
s
pagan
piety
but
i
had
ceased
to
dream
and
had
nothing
to
dread
from
any
new
disenchanters
the
ruins
the
fragments
of
one
or
two
prostrate
pillars
lie
upon
a
promontory
bare
and
unmystified
by
the
gloom
of
surrounding
groves
my
greek
friend
in
his
consular
cap
stood
by
respectfully
waiting
to
see
what
turn
my
madness
would
take
now
that
i
had
come
at
last
into
the
presence
of
the
old
stones
if
you
have
no
taste
for
research
and
can
t
affect
to
look
for
inscriptions
there
is
some
awkwardness
in
coming
to
the
end
of
a
merely
sentimental
pilgrimage
when
the
feeling
which
impelled
you
has
gone
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
laugh
the
thing
off
as
well
as
you
can
and
by
the
bye
it
is
not
a
bad
plan
to
turn
the
conversation
or
rather
allow
the
natives
to
turn
it
towards
the
subject
of
hidden
treasures
this
is
a
topic
on
which
they
will
always
speak
with
eagerness
and
if
they
can
fancy
that
you
too
take
an
interest
in
such
matters
they
will
not
only
think
you
perfectly
sane
but
will
begin
to
give
you
credit
for
some
more
than
human
powers
of
forcing
the
obscure
earth
to
show
you
its
hoards
of
gold
when
we
returned
to
baffa
the
seized
a
club
with
the
quietly
determined
air
of
a
brave
man
resolved
to
do
some
deed
of
note
he
went
into
the
yard
adjoining
his
cottage
where
there
were
some
thin
thoughtful
canting
cocks
and
serious
hens
respectfully
listening
and
chickens
of
tender
years
so
well
brought
up
as
scarcely
to
betray
in
their
conduct
the
careless
levity
of
youth
the
stood
for
a
moment
quite
calm
collecting
his
strength
then
suddenly
he
rushed
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
began
to
deal
death
and
destruction
on
all
sides
he
spared
neither
sex
nor
age
the
dead
and
dying
were
immediately
removed
from
the
field
of
slaughter
and
in
less
than
an
hour
i
think
they
were
brought
on
the
table
deeply
buried
in
mounds
of
snowy
rice
my
host
was
in
all
respects
a
fine
generous
fellow
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
impoverishing
him
by
my
visit
and
i
consulted
my
faithful
mysseri
who
not
only
assured
me
that
i
might
safely
offer
money
to
the
but
recommended
that
i
should
give
no
more
to
him
than
to
the
other
meaning
any
other
peasant
i
felt
however
that
there
was
something
about
the
man
besides
the
flag
and
the
cap
which
made
me
shrink
from
offering
coin
and
as
i
mounted
my
horse
on
departing
i
gave
him
the
only
thing
fit
for
a
present
that
i
happened
to
have
with
me
a
rather
handsome
brought
from
vienna
the
poor
fellow
was
ineffably
grateful
and
i
had
some
difficulty
in
tearing
myself
from
out
of
the
reach
of
his
thanks
at
last
i
gave
him
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
last
farewell
and
rode
on
but
i
had
not
gained
more
than
about
a
hundred
yards
when
my
host
came
bounding
and
shouting
after
me
with
a
goat
cheese
in
his
hand
which
he
implored
me
to
accept
in
old
times
the
shepherd
of
theocritus
or
to
speak
less
dishonestly
the
shepherd
of
the
poetæ
græci
sung
his
best
song
i
in
this
latter
age
presented
my
best
dagger
and
both
of
us
received
the
same
rustic
reward
it
had
been
known
that
i
should
return
to
limasol
and
when
i
arrived
there
i
found
that
a
noble
old
greek
had
been
hospitably
plotting
to
have
me
for
his
guest
i
willingly
accepted
his
offer
the
day
of
my
arrival
happened
to
be
the
birthday
of
my
host
and
in
consequence
of
this
there
was
a
constant
influx
of
visitors
who
came
to
offer
their
congratulations
a
few
of
these
were
men
but
most
of
them
were
young
graceful
girls
almost
all
of
them
went
through
the
ceremony
with
the
utmost
precision
and
formality
each
in
succession
spoke
her
blessing
in
the
tone
of
a
person
repeating
a
set
formula
then
deferentially
accepted
the
invitation
to
sit
partook
of
the
proffered
sweetmeats
and
the
cold
glittering
water
remained
for
a
few
minutes
either
in
silence
or
engaged
in
very
thin
conversation
then
arose
delivered
a
second
benediction
followed
by
an
elaborate
farewell
and
departed
the
bewitching
power
attributed
at
this
day
to
the
women
of
cyprus
is
curious
in
connection
with
the
worship
of
the
sweet
goddess
who
called
their
isle
her
own
the
cypriote
is
not
i
think
nearly
so
beautiful
in
face
as
the
ionian
queens
of
izmir
but
she
is
tall
and
slightly
formed
there
is
a
meaning
and
expression
a
seeming
consciousness
of
gentle
empire
that
speaks
in
the
wavy
line
of
the
shoulder
and
winds
itself
like
cytherea
s
own
cestus
around
the
slender
waist
then
the
hair
not
enviously
gathered
together
under
the
descends
the
neck
and
passes
the
waist
in
sumptuous
braids
of
all
other
women
with
grecian
blood
in
their
veins
the
costume
is
graciously
beautiful
but
these
the
maidens
of
robes
are
more
gently
more
sweetly
imagined
and
fall
like
julia
s
cashmere
in
soft
luxurious
folds
the
common
voice
of
the
levant
allows
that
in
face
the
women
of
cyprus
are
less
beautiful
than
their
brilliant
sisters
of
smyrna
and
yet
says
the
greek
he
may
trust
himself
to
one
and
all
the
bright
cities
of
the
ægean
and
may
yet
weigh
anchor
with
a
heart
entire
but
that
so
surely
as
he
ventures
upon
the
enchanted
isle
of
cyprus
so
surely
will
he
know
the
rapture
or
the
bitterness
of
love
the
charm
they
say
owes
its
power
to
that
which
the
people
call
the
astonishing
politics
of
the
women
meaning
i
fancy
their
tact
and
their
witching
ways
the
word
however
plainly
fails
to
express
one
half
of
that
which
the
speakers
would
say
i
have
smiled
to
hear
the
greek
with
all
his
plenteousness
of
fancy
and
all
the
wealth
of
his
generous
language
yet
vainly
struggling
to
describe
the
ineffable
spell
which
the
parisians
dispose
of
in
their
own
smart
way
by
a
summary
je

went
to
larnaca
the
chief
city
of
the
isle
and
over
the

at

to
beyrout
chapter
viii
lady
hester
stanhope
beyrout
on
its
land
side
is
hemmed
in
by
the
druses
who
occupy
all
the
neighbouring
highlands
often
enough
i
saw
the
ghostly
images
of
the
women
with
their
exalted
horns
stalking
through
the
streets
and
i
saw
too
in
travelling
the
affrighted
groups
of
the
mountaineers
as
they
fled
before
me
under
the
fear
that
my
party
might
be
a
company
of
commissioners
or
a
enforcing
the
conscription
for
mehemet
ali
but
nearly
all
my
knowledge
of
the
people
except
in
regard
of
their
mere
costume
and
outward
appearance
is
drawn
from
books
and
despatches
to
which
i
have
the
honour
to
refer
you
i
received
hospitable
welcome
at
beyrout
from
the
europeans
as
well
as
from
the
syrian
christians
and
i
soon
discovered
that
their
standing
topic
of
interest
was
the
lady
hester
stanhope
who
lived
in
an
old
convent
on
the
lebanon
range
at
the
distance
of
about
a
day
s
journey
from
the
town
the
lady
s
habit
of
refusing
to
see
europeans
added
the
charm
of
mystery
to
a
character
which
even
without
that
aid
was
sufficiently
distinguished
to
command
attention
many
years
of
lady
hester
s
early
womanhood
had
been
passed
with
lady
chatham
at
burton
pynsent
and
during
that
inglorious
period
of
the
heroine
s
life
her
commanding
character
and
as
they
would
have
called
it
in
the
language
of
those
days
her
condescending
kindness
towards
my
mother
s
family
had
increased
in
them
those
strong
feelings
of
respect
and
attachment
which
her
rank
and
station
alone
would
have
easily
won
from
people
of
the
middle
class
you
may
suppose
how
deeply
the
quiet
women
in
somersetshire
must
have
been
interested
when
they
slowly
learned
by
vague
and
uncertain
tidings
that
the
intrepid
girl
who
had
been
used
to
break
their
vicious
horses
for
them
was
reigning
in
sovereignty
over
the
wandering
tribes
of
western
asia
i
know
that
her
name
was
made
almost
as
familiar
to
me
in
my
childhood
as
the
name
of
robinson
were
associated
with
the
spirit
of
adventure
but
whilst
the
imagined
life
of
the
castaway
mariner
never
failed
to
seem
glaringly
real
the
true
story
of
the
englishwoman
ruling
over
arabs
always
sounded
to
me
like
fable
i
never
had
heard
nor
indeed
i
believe
had
the
rest
of
the
world
ever
heard
anything
like
a
certain
account
of
the
heroine
s
adventures
all
i
knew
was
that
in
one
of
the
drawers
which
were
the
delight
of
my
childhood
along
with
attar
of
roses
and
fragrant
wonders
from
hindustan
there
were
letters
carefully
treasured
and
trifling
presents
which
i
was
taught
to
think
valuable
because
they
had
come
from
the
queen
of
the
desert
who
dwelt
in
tents
and
reigned
over
wandering
arabs
this
subject
however
died
away
and
from
the
ending
of
my
childhood
up
to
the
period
of
my
arrival
in
the
levant
i
had
seldom
even
heard
a
mentioning
of
the
lady
hester
stanhope
but
now
wherever
i
went
i
was
met
by
the
name
so
familiar
in
sound
and
yet
so
full
of
mystery
from
the
vague
sort
of
idea
which
it
brought
to
my
mind
i
heard
it
too
connected
with
fresh
wonders
for
it
was
said
that
the
woman
was
now
acknowledged
as
an
inspired
being
by
the
people
of
the
mountains
and
it
was
even
hinted
with
horror
that
she
claimed
to
be
than
a
i
felt
at
once
that
my
mother
would
be
sadly
sorry
to
hear
that
i
had
been
within
a
day
s
ride
of
her
early
friend
without
offering
to
see
her
and
i
therefore
despatched
a
letter
to
the
recluse
mentioning
the
maiden
name
of
my
mother
whose
marriage
was
subsequent
to
lady
hester
s
departure
and
saying
that
if
there
existed
on
the
part
of
her
ladyship
any
wish
to
hear
of
her
old
somersetshire
acquaintance
i
should
make
a
point
of
visiting
her
my
letter
was
sent
by
a
who
was
to
take
an
unlimited
time
for
his
journey
so
that
it
was
not
i
think
until
either
the
third
or
the
fourth
day
that
the
answer
arrived
a
couple
of
horsemen
covered
with
mud
suddenly
dashed
into
the
little
court
of
the
locanda
in
which
i
was
staying
bearing
themselves
as
ostentatiously
as
though
they
were
carrying
a
cartel
from
the
devil
to
the
angel
michael
one
of
these
the
other
being
his
attendant
was
an
italian
by
birth
though
now
completely
orientalised
who
lived
in
my
lady
s
establishment
as
doctor
nominally
but
practically
as
an
upper
servant
he
presented
me
a
very
kind
and
appropriate
letter
of
invitation
it
happened
that
i
was
rather
unwell
at
this
time
so
that
i
named
a
more
distant
day
for
my
visit
than
i
should
otherwise
have
done
and
after
all
i
did
not
start
at
the
time
fixed
whilst
still
remaining
at
beyrout
i
received
this
letter
which
certainly
betrays
no
symptom
of
the
pretensions
to
divine
power
which
were
popularly
attributed
to
the
writer
sir
hope
i
shall
be
disappointed
in
seeing
you
on
wednesday
for
the
late
rains
have
rendered
the
river
damoor
if
not
dangerous
at
least
very
unpleasant
to
pass
for
a
person
who
has
been
lately
indisposed
for
if
the
animal
swims
you
would
be
immerged
in
the
waters
the
weather
will
probably
change
after
the
of
the
moon
and
after
a
couple
of
days
the
roads
and
the
river
will
be
passable
therefore
i
shall
expect
you
either
saturday
or
monday
it
will
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
have
an
opportunity
of
inquiring
after
your
mother
who
was
a
sweet
lovely
girl
when
i
knew
me
sir
yours
sincerely
hester
lucy
early
one
morning
i
started
from
beyrout
there
are
no
regularly
established
relays
of
horses
in
syria
at
least
not
in
the
line
which
i
took
and
you
therefore
hire
your
cattle
for
the
whole
journey
or
at
all
events
for
your
journey
to
some
large
town
under
these
circumstances
you
have
no
occasion
for
a
tatar
whose
principal
utility
consists
in
his
power
to
compel
the
supply
of
horses
in
other
respects
the
mode
of
travelling
through
syria
differs
very
little
from
that
which
i
have
described
as
prevailing
in
turkey
i
hired
my
horses
and
mules
for
i
had
some
of
both
for
the
whole
of
the
journey
from
beyrout
to
jerusalem
the
owner
of
the
beasts
who
had
a
couple
of
fellows
under
him
was
the
most
dignified
member
of
my
party
he
was
indeed
a
magnificent
old
man
and
was
called
shereef
or
holy
title
of
honour
which
with
the
privilege
of
wearing
the
green
turban
he
well
deserved
not
only
from
the
blood
of
the
prophet
that
flowed
in
his
veins
but
from
the
sanctity
of
his
life
and
the
length
of
his
blessed
beard
mysseri
of
course
still
travelled
with
me
but
the
arabic
was
not
one
of
the
seven
languages
which
he
spoke
so
perfectly
and
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
hire
another
interpreter
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
proper
man
for
the
demetrius
or
as
he
was
always
called
dthemetri
a
native
of
zante
who
had
been
tossed
about
by
fortune
in
all
directions
he
spoke
the
arabic
very
well
and
communicated
with
me
in
italian
the
man
was
a
very
zealous
member
of
the
greek
church
he
had
been
a
tailor
he
was
as
ugly
as
the
devil
having
a
thoroughly
tatar
countenance
which
expressed
the
agony
of
his
body
or
mind
as
the
case
might
be
in
the
most
ludicrous
manner
imaginable
he
embellished
the
natural
caricature
of
his
person
by
suspending
about
his
neck
and
shoulders
and
waist
quantities
of
little
bundles
and
parcels
which
he
thought
too
valuable
to
be
entrusted
to
the
jerking
of
the
mule
that
fell
to
his
lot
on
this
journey
every
now
and
then
forgetting
that
his
rider
was
a
saint
and
remembering
that
he
was
a
tailor
took
a
quiet
roll
upon
the
ground
and
stretched
his
limbs
calmly
and
lazily
like
a
good
man
awaiting
a
sermon
dthemetri
never
got
seriously
hurt
but
the
subversion
and
dislocation
of
his
bundles
made
him
for
the
moment
a
sad
spectacle
of
ruin
and
when
he
regained
his
legs
his
wrath
with
the
mule
became
very
amusing
he
always
addressed
the
beast
in
language
which
implied
that
he
as
a
christian
and
saint
had
been
personally
insulted
and
oppressed
by
a
mahometan
mule
dthemetri
however
on
the
whole
proved
to
be
a
most
able
and
capital
servant
i
suspected
him
of
now
and
then
leading
me
out
of
my
way
in
order
that
he
might
have
the
opportunity
of
visiting
the
shrine
of
a
saint
and
on
one
occasion
as
you
will
see
by
and
by
he
was
induced
by
religious
motives
to
commit
a
gross
breach
of
duty
but
putting
these
pious
faults
out
of
the
question
and
they
were
faults
of
the
right
side
he
was
always
faithful
and
true
to
me
i
left
saïde
the
sidon
of
ancient
times
on
my
right
and
about
an
hour
i
think
before
sunset
began
to
ascend
one
of
the
many
low
hills
of
lebanon
on
the
summit
before
me
was
a
broad
grey
mass
of
irregular
building
which
from
its
position
as
well
as
from
the
gloomy
blankness
of
its
walls
gave
the
idea
of
a
neglected
fortress
it
had
in
fact
been
a
convent
of
great
size
and
like
most
of
the
religious
houses
in
this
part
of
the
world
had
been
made
strong
enough
for
opposing
an
inert
resistance
to
any
mere
casual
band
of
assailants
who
might
be
unprovided
with
regular
means
of
attack
this
was
the
of
the
chatham
s
fiery
granddaughter
the
aspect
of
the
first
court
which
i
entered
was
such
as
to
keep
one
in
the
idea
of
having
to
do
with
a
fortress
rather
than
a
mere
peaceable
a
number
of
and
albanian
soldiers
were
hanging
about
the
place
and
striving
to
bear
the
curse
of
tranquillity
as
well
as
they
could
two
or
three
of
them
i
think
were
smoking
their
but
the
rest
of
them
were
lying
torpidly
upon
the
flat
stones
like
the
bodies
of
departed
brigands
i
rode
on
to
an
inner
part
of
the
building
and
at
last
quitting
my
horses
was
conducted
through
a
doorway
that
led
me
at
once
from
an
open
court
into
an
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
as
i
entered
an
oriental
figure
in
male
costume
approached
me
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
with
many
and
profound
bows
but
the
growing
shades
of
evening
prevented
me
from
distinguishing
the
features
of
the
personage
who
was
receiving
me
with
this
solemn
welcome
i
had
always
however
understood
that
lady
hester
stanhope
wore
the
male
attire
and
i
began
to
utter
in
english
the
common
civilities
that
seemed
to
be
proper
on
the
commencement
of
a
visit
by
an
uninspired
mortal
to
a
renowned
prophetess
but
the
figure
which
i
addressed
only
bowed
so
much
the
more
prostrating
itself
almost
to
the
ground
but
speaking
to
me
never
a
word
i
feebly
strived
not
to
be
outdone
in
gestures
of
respect
but
presently
my
bowing
opponent
saw
the
error
under
which
i
was
acting
and
suddenly
convinced
me
that
at
all
events
i
was
not
in
the
presence
of
a
superhuman
being
by
declaring
that
he
was
not
miladi
but
was
in
fact
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
poor
doctor
who
had
brought
his
mistress
s
letter
to
beyrout
her
ladyship
in
the
right
spirit
of
hospitality
now
sent
and
commanded
me
to
repose
for
a
while
after
the
fatigues
of
my
journey
and
to
dine
the
cuisine
was
of
the
oriental
kind
which
is
highly
artificial
and
i
thought
it
very
good
i
rejoiced
too
in
the
wine
of
the
lebanon
soon
after
the
ending
of
the
dinner
the
doctor
arrived
with
miladi
s
compliments
and
an
intimation
that
she
would
be
happy
to
receive
me
if
i
were
so
disposed
it
had
now
grown
dark
and
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
so
that
i
got
rather
wet
in
following
my
guide
through
the
open
courts
that
i
had
to
pass
in
order
to
reach
the
presence
chamber
at
last
i
was
ushered
into
a
small
apartment
which
was
protected
from
the
draughts
of
air
passing
through
the
doorway
by
a
folding
screen
passing
this
i
came
alongside
of
a
common
european
sofa
where
sat
the
lady
prophetess
she
rose
from
her
seat
very
formally
spoke
to
me
a
few
words
of
welcome
pointed
to
a
chair
which
was
placed
exactly
opposite
to
her
sofa
at
a
couple
of
yards
distance
and
remained
standing
up
to
the
full
of
her
majestic
height
perfectly
still
and
motionless
until
i
had
taken
my
appointed
place
she
then
resumed
her
seat
not
packing
herself
up
according
to
the
mode
of
the
orientals
but
allowing
her
feet
to
rest
on
the
floor
or
the
footstool
at
the
moment
of
seating
herself
she
covered
her
lap
with
a
mass
of
loose
white
drapery
which
she
held
in
her
hand
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
that
she
did
this
in
order
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
of
sitting
in
manifest
trousers
under
the
eye
of
a
european
but
i
can
hardly
fancy
now
that
with
her
wilful
nature
she
would
have
brooked
such
a
compromise
as
this
the
woman
before
me
had
exactly
the
person
of
a
indeed
of
the
divine
sibyl
imagined
by
domenichino
so
sweetly
distracted
betwixt
love
and
mystery
but
of
a
good
practical
prophetess
long
used
to
the
exercise
of
her
sacred
calling
i
have
been
told
by
those
who
knew
lady
hester
stanhope
in
her
youth
that
any
notion
of
a
resemblance
betwixt
her
and
the
great
chatham
must
have
been
fanciful
but
at
the
time
of
my
seeing
her
the
large
commanding
features
of
the
gaunt
woman
then
sixty
years
old
or
more
certainly
reminded
me
of
the
statesman
that
lay
dying
in
the
house
of
lords
according
to
copley
s
picture
her
face
was
of
the
most
astonishing
whiteness
she
wore
a
very
large
turban
which
seemed
to
be
of
pale
cashmere
shawls
so
disposed
as
to
conceal
the
hair
her
dress
from
the
chin
down
to
the
point
at
which
it
was
concealed
by
the
drapery
which
she
held
over
her
lap
was
a
mass
of
white
linen
loosely
ecclesiastical
sort
of
affair
more
like
a
surplice
than
any
of
those
blessed
creations
which
our
souls
love
under
the
names
of
dress
and
frock
and
bodice
and
collar
and
and
sweet
such
was
the
outward
seeming
of
the
personage
that
sat
before
me
and
indeed
she
was
almost
bound
by
the
fame
of
her
actual
achievements
as
well
as
by
her
sublime
pretensions
to
look
a
little
differently
from
the
rest
of
womankind
there
had
been
something
of
grandeur
in
her
career
after
the
death
of
lady
chatham
which
happened
in
she
lived
under
the
roof
of
her
uncle
the
second
pitt
and
when
he
resumed
the
government
in
she
became
the
dispenser
of
much
patronage
and
sole
secretary
of
state
for
the
department
of
treasury
banquets
not
having
seen
the
lady
until
late
in
her
life
when
she
was
fired
with
spiritual
ambition
i
can
hardly
fancy
that
she
could
have
performed
her
political
duties
in
the
saloons
of
the
minister
with
much
of
feminine
sweetness
and
patience
i
am
told
however
that
she
managed
matters
very
well
indeed
perhaps
it
was
better
for
the
leader
of
the
house
to
have
his
guarded
by
this
stately
creature
than
by
a
merely
clever
and
managing
woman
it
was
fitting
that
the
wholesome
awe
with
which
he
filled
the
minds
of
the
country
gentlemen
should
be
aggravated
by
the
presence
of
his
majestic
niece
but
the
end
was
approaching
the
sun
of
austerlitz
showed
the
czar
madly
sliding
his
splendid
army
like
a
weaver
s
shuttle
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left
under
the
very
deep
grey
watchful
eyes
of
napoleon
before
night
came
the
coalition
was
a
vain
for
history
and
the
heart
of
its
great
author
was
crushed
with
grief
when
the
terrible
tidings
came
to
his
ears
in
the
bitterness
of
his
despair
he
cried
out
to
his
niece
and
bid
her
roll
up
the
map
of
europe
there
was
a
little
more
of
suffering
and
at
last
with
his
swollen
tongue
so
they
say
still
muttering
something
for
england
he
died
by
the
noblest
of
all
sorrows
lady
hester
meeting
the
calamity
in
her
own
fierce
way
seems
to
have
scorned
the
poor
island
that
had
not
enough
of
god
s
grace
to
keep
the
minister
alive
i
can
hardly
tell
why
it
should
be
but
there
is
a
longing
for
the
east
very
commonly
felt
by
people
when
goaded
by
sorrow
lady
hester
stanhope
obeyed
this
impulse
for
some
time
i
believe
she
was
at
constantinople
where
her
magnificence
and
near
alliance
to
the
late
minister
gained
her
great
influence
afterwards
she
passed
into
syria
the
people
of
that
country
excited
by
the
achievements
of
sir
sidney
smith
had
begun
to
imagine
the
possibility
of
their
land
being
occupied
by
the
english
and
many
of
them
looked
upon
lady
hester
as
a
princess
who
came
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
expected
conquest
i
don
t
know
it
from
her
own
lips
or
indeed
from
any
certain
authority
but
i
have
been
told
that
she
began
her
connection
with
the
bedouins
by
making
a
large
present
of
money
it
was
in
piastres
to
the
sheik
whose
authority
was
recognised
in
that
part
of
the
desert
which
lies
between
damascus
and
palmyra
the
prestige
created
by
the
rumours
of
her
high
and
undefined
rank
as
well
as
of
her
wealth
and
corresponding
magnificence
was
well
sustained
by
her
imperious
character
and
her
dauntless
bravery
her
influence
increased
i
never
heard
anything
satisfactory
as
to
the
real
extent
or
duration
of
her
sway
but
it
seemed
that
for
a
time
at
least
she
certainly
exercised
something
like
sovereignty
amongst
the
wandering
tribes
and
now
that
her
earthly
kingdom
had
passed
away
she
strove
for
spiritual
power
and
impiously
dared
as
it
was
said
to
boast
some
mystic
union
with
the
very
god
of
very
god
a
couple
of
black
slave
girls
came
at
a
signal
and
supplied
their
mistress
as
well
as
myself
with
lighted
and
coffee
the
custom
of
the
east
sanctions
and
almost
commands
some
moments
of
silence
whilst
you
are
inhaling
the
first
few
breaths
of
the
fragrant
pipe
the
pause
was
broken
i
think
by
my
lady
who
addressed
to
me
some
inquiries
respecting
my
mother
and
particularly
as
to
her
marriage
but
before
i
had
communicated
any
great
amount
of
family
facts
the
spirit
of
the
prophetess
kindled
within
her
and
presently
though
with
all
the
skill
of
a
woman
of
the
world
she
shuffled
away
the
subject
of
poor
dear
somersetshire
and
bounded
onward
into
loftier
spheres
of
thought
my
old
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
twelve
enabled
me
to
bear
my
part
of
course
a
very
humble
one
in
a
conversation
relative
to
occult
science
milnes
once
spread
a
report
that
every
gang
of
gipsies
was
found
upon
inquiry
to
have
come
last
from
a
place
to
the
westward
and
to
be
about
to
make
the
next
move
in
an
eastern
direction
either
therefore
they
were
to
be
all
gathered
together
towards
the
rising
of
the
sun
by
the
mysterious
finger
of
providence
or
else
they
were
to
revolve
round
the
globe
for
ever
and
ever
both
of
these
suppositions
were
highly
gratifying
because
they
were
both
marvellous
and
though
the
story
on
which
they
were
founded
plainly
sprang
from
the
inventive
brain
of
a
poet
no
one
had
ever
been
so
odiously
statistical
as
to
attempt
a
contradiction
of
it
i
now
mentioned
the
story
as
a
report
to
lady
hester
stanhope
and
asked
her
if
it
were
true
i
could
not
have
touched
upon
any
imaginable
subject
more
deeply
interesting
to
my
hearer
more
closely
akin
to
her
habitual
train
of
thinking
she
immediately
threw
off
all
the
restraint
belonging
to
an
interview
with
a
stranger
and
when
she
had
received
a
few
more
similar
proofs
of
my
aptness
for
the
marvellous
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
would
adopt
me
as
her
in
occult
science
for
hours
and
hours
this
wondrous
white
woman
poured
forth
her
speech
for
the
most
part
concerning
sacred
and
profane
mysteries
but
every
now
and
then
she
would
stay
her
lofty
flight
and
swoop
down
upon
the
world
again
whenever
this
happened
i
was
interested
in
her
conversation
she
adverted
more
than
once
to
the
period
of
her
lost
sway
amongst
the
arabs
and
mentioned
some
of
the
circumstances
that
aided
her
in
obtaining
influence
with
the
wandering
tribes
the
bedouin
so
often
engaged
in
irregular
warfare
strains
his
eyes
to
the
horizon
in
search
of
a
coming
enemy
just
as
habitually
as
the
sailor
keeps
his
bright
for
a
strange
sail
in
the
absence
of
telescopes
a
sight
is
highly
valued
and
lady
hester
possessed
this
quality
to
an
extraordinary
degree
she
told
me
that
on
one
occasion
when
there
was
good
reason
to
expect
a
hostile
attack
great
excitement
was
felt
in
the
camp
by
the
report
of
a
arab
who
declared
that
he
could
just
distinguish
some
moving
objects
upon
the
very
farthest
point
within
the
reach
of
his
eyes
lady
hester
was
consulted
and
she
instantly
assured
her
comrades
in
arms
that
there
were
indeed
a
number
of
horses
within
sight
but
that
they
were
without
riders
the
assertion
proved
to
be
correct
and
from
that
time
forth
her
superiority
over
all
others
in
respect
of
far
sight
remained
undisputed
lady
hester
related
to
me
this
other
anecdote
of
her
arab
life
it
was
when
the
heroic
qualities
of
the
englishwoman
were
just
beginning
to
be
felt
amongst
the
people
of
the
desert
that
she
was
marching
one
day
along
with
the
forces
of
the
tribe
to
which
she
had
allied
herself
she
perceived
that
preparations
for
an
engagement
were
going
on
and
upon
her
making
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
the
sheik
at
first
affected
mystery
and
concealment
but
at
last
confessed
that
war
had
been
declared
against
his
tribe
on
account
of
its
alliance
with
the
english
princess
and
that
they
were
now
unfortunately
about
to
be
attacked
by
a
very
superior
force
he
made
it
appear
that
lady
hester
was
the
sole
cause
of
hostility
betwixt
his
tribe
and
the
impending
enemy
and
that
his
sacred
duty
of
protecting
the
englishwoman
whom
he
had
admitted
as
his
guest
was
the
only
obstacle
which
prevented
an
amicable
arrangement
of
the
dispute
the
sheik
hinted
that
his
tribe
was
likely
to
sustain
an
almost
overwhelming
blow
but
at
the
same
time
declared
that
no
fear
of
the
consequences
however
terrible
to
him
and
his
whole
people
should
induce
him
to
dream
of
abandoning
his
illustrious
guest
the
heroine
instantly
took
her
part
it
was
not
for
her
to
be
a
source
of
danger
to
her
friends
but
rather
to
her
enemies
so
she
resolved
to
turn
away
from
the
people
and
trust
for
help
to
none
save
only
her
haughty
self
the
sheiks
affected
to
dissuade
her
from
so
rash
a
course
and
fairly
told
her
that
although
they
having
been
freed
from
her
presence
would
be
able
to
make
good
terms
for
themselves
yet
that
there
were
no
means
of
allaying
the
hostility
felt
towards
her
and
that
the
whole
face
of
the
desert
would
be
swept
by
the
horsemen
of
her
enemies
so
carefully
as
to
make
her
escape
into
other
districts
almost
impossible
the
brave
woman
was
not
to
be
moved
by
terrors
of
this
kind
and
bidding
farewell
to
the
tribe
which
had
honoured
and
protected
her
she
turned
her
horse
s
head
and
rode
straight
away
from
them
without
friend
or
follower
hours
had
elapsed
and
for
some
time
she
had
been
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
round
horizon
when
her
quick
eye
perceived
some
horsemen
in
the
distance
the
party
came
nearer
and
nearer
soon
it
was
plain
that
they
were
making
towards
her
and
presently
some
hundreds
of
bedouins
fully
armed
galloped
up
to
her
ferociously
shouting
and
apparently
intending
to
take
her
life
at
the
instant
with
their
pointed
spears
her
face
at
the
time
was
covered
with
the
according
to
eastern
usage
but
at
the
moment
when
the
foremost
of
the
horsemen
had
all
but
reached
her
with
their
spears
she
stood
up
in
her
stirrups
withdrew
the
that
veiled
the
terrors
of
her
countenance
waved
her
arm
slowly
and
disdainfully
and
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
avaunt
the
horsemen
recoiled
from
her
glance
but
not
in
terror
the
threatening
yells
of
the
assailants
were
suddenly
changed
for
loud
shouts
of
joy
and
admiration
at
the
bravery
of
the
stately
englishwoman
and
festive
gunshots
were
fired
on
all
sides
around
her
honoured
head
the
truth
was
that
the
party
belonged
to
the
tribe
with
which
she
had
allied
herself
and
that
the
threatened
attack
as
well
as
the
pretended
apprehension
of
an
engagement
had
been
contrived
for
the
mere
purpose
of
testing
her
courage
the
day
ended
in
a
great
feast
prepared
to
do
honour
to
the
heroine
and
from
that
time
her
power
over
the
minds
of
the
people
grew
rapidly
lady
hester
related
this
story
with
great
spirit
and
i
recollect
that
she
put
up
her
for
a
moment
in
order
to
give
me
a
better
idea
of
the
effect
which
she
produced
by
suddenly
revealing
the
awfulness
of
her
countenance
with
respect
to
her
then
present
mode
of
life
lady
hester
informed
me
that
for
her
sin
she
had
subjected
herself
during
many
years
to
severe
penance
and
that
her
had
not
been
without
its
reward
vain
and
false
said
she
is
all
the
pretended
knowledge
of
the
doctors
will
tell
you
that
the
drinking
of
milk
gives
yellowness
to
the
complexion
milk
is
my
only
food
and
you
see
if
my
face
be
not
her
abstinence
from
food
intellectual
was
carried
as
far
as
her
physical
fasting
she
never
she
said
looked
upon
a
book
or
a
newspaper
but
trusted
alone
to
the
stars
for
her
sublime
knowledge
she
usually
passed
the
nights
in
communing
with
these
heavenly
teachers
and
lay
at
rest
during
the
daytime
she
spoke
with
great
contempt
of
the
frivolity
and
benighted
ignorance
of
the
modern
europeans
and
mentioned
in
proof
of
this
that
they
were
not
only
untaught
in
astrology
but
were
unacquainted
with
the
common
and
phenomena
produced
by
magic
art
she
spoke
as
if
she
would
make
me
understand
that
all
sorcerous
spells
were
completely
at
her
command
but
that
the
exercise
of
such
powers
would
be
derogatory
to
her
high
rank
in
the
heavenly
kingdom
she
said
that
the
spell
by
which
the
face
of
an
absent
person
is
thrown
upon
a
mirror
was
within
the
reach
of
the
humblest
and
most
contemptible
magicians
but
that
the
practice
of
arts
was
unholy
as
well
as
vulgar
we
spoke
of
the
bending
twig
by
which
it
is
said
precious
metals
may
be
discovered
in
relation
to
this
the
prophetess
told
me
a
story
rather
against
herself
and
inconsistent
with
the
notion
of
her
being
perfect
in
her
science
but
i
think
that
she
mentioned
the
facts
as
having
happened
before
the
time
at
which
she
attained
to
the
great
spiritual
authority
which
she
now
arrogated
she
told
me
that
vast
treasures
were
known
to
exist
in
a
situation
which
she
mentioned
if
i
rightly
remember
as
being
near
suez
that
napoleon
profanely
brave
thrust
his
arm
into
the
cave
containing
the
coveted
gold
and
that
instantly
his
flesh
became
palsied
but
the
youthful
hero
for
she
said
he
was
great
in
his
generation
was
not
to
be
thus
daunted
he
fell
back
characteristically
upon
his
brazen
resources
and
ordered
up
his
artillery
but
man
could
not
strive
with
demons
and
napoleon
was
foiled
in
after
years
came
ibrahim
pasha
with
heavy
guns
and
wicked
spells
to
boot
but
the
infernal
guardians
of
the
treasure
were
too
strong
for
him
it
was
after
this
that
lady
hester
passed
by
the
spot
and
she
described
with
animated
gesture
the
force
and
energy
with
which
the
divining
twig
had
suddenly
leaped
in
her
hands
she
ordered
excavations
and
no
demons
opposed
her
enterprise
the
vast
chest
in
which
the
treasure
had
been
deposited
was
at
length
discovered
but
lo
and
behold
it
was
full
of
pebbles
she
said
however
that
the
times
were
approaching
in
which
the
hidden
treasures
of
the
earth
would
become
available
to
those
who
had
true
knowledge
speaking
of
ibrahim
pasha
lady
hester
said
that
he
was
a
bold
bad
man
and
was
possessed
of
some
of
those
common
and
wicked
magical
arts
upon
which
she
looked
down
with
so
much
contempt
she
said
for
instance
that
ibrahim
s
life
was
charmed
against
balls
and
steel
and
that
after
a
battle
he
loosened
the
folds
of
his
shawl
and
shook
out
the
bullets
like
dust
it
seems
that
the
simonians
once
made
overtures
to
lady
hester
she
told
me
that
the
père
enfantin
the
chief
of
the
sect
had
sent
her
a
service
of
plate
but
that
she
had
declined
to
receive
it
she
delivered
a
prediction
as
to
the
probability
of
the
simonians
finding
the
mystic
mother
and
this
she
did
in
a
way
which
would
amuse
you
unfortunately
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
mention
this
part
of
the
woman
s
prophecies
why
i
can
not
tell
but
so
it
is
that
she
bound
me
to
eternal
secrecy
lady
hester
told
me
that
since
her
residence
at
djoun
she
had
been
attacked
by
a
terrible
illness
which
rendered
her
for
a
long
time
perfectly
helpless
all
her
attendants
fled
and
left
her
to
perish
whilst
she
lay
thus
alone
and
quite
unable
to
rise
robbers
came
and
carried
away
her
property
she
told
me
that
they
actually
unroofed
a
great
part
of
the
building
and
employed
engines
with
pulleys
for
the
purpose
of
hoisting
out
such
of
her
valuables
as
were
too
bulky
to
pass
through
doors
it
would
seem
that
before
this
catastrophe
lady
hester
had
been
rich
in
the
possession
of
eastern
luxuries
for
she
told
me
that
when
the
chiefs
of
the
ottoman
force
took
refuge
with
her
after
the
fall
of
acre
they
brought
their
wives
also
in
great
numbers
to
all
of
these
lady
hester
as
she
said
presented
magnificent
dresses
but
her
generosity
occasioned
strife
only
instead
of
gratitude
for
every
woman
who
fancied
her
present
less
splendid
than
that
of
another
with
equal
or
less
pretension
became
absolutely
furious
all
these
audacious
guests
had
now
been
got
rid
of
but
the
albanian
soldiers
who
had
taken
refuge
with
lady
hester
at
the
same
time
still
remained
under
her
protection
in
truth
this
convent
guarded
by
the
proud
heart
of
an
english
gentlewoman
was
the
only
spot
throughout
all
syria
and
palestine
in
which
the
will
of
mehemet
ali
and
his
fierce
lieutenant
was
not
the
law
more
than
once
had
the
pasha
of
egypt
commanded
that
ibrahim
should
have
the
albanians
delivered
up
to
him
but
this
white
woman
of
the
mountain
grown
classical
not
by
books
but
by
very
pride
answered
only
with
a
disdainful
invitation
to
come
and
take
whether
it
was
that
ibrahim
was
acted
upon
by
any
superstitious
dread
of
interfering
with
the
prophetess
a
notion
not
at
all
incompatible
with
his
character
as
an
able
oriental
commander
or
that
he
feared
the
ridicule
of
putting
himself
in
collision
with
a
gentlewoman
he
certainly
never
ventured
to
attack
the
sanctuary
and
so
long
as
the
chatham
s
granddaughter
breathed
a
breath
of
life
there
was
always
this
one
hillock
and
that
too
in
the
midst
of
a
most
populous
district
which
stood
out
and
kept
its
freedom
mehemet
ali
used
to
say
i
am
told
that
the
englishwoman
had
given
him
more
trouble
than
all
the
insurgent
people
of
syria
and
palestine
the
prophetess
announced
to
me
that
we
were
upon
the
eve
of
a
stupendous
convulsion
which
would
destroy
the
then
recognised
value
of
all
property
upon
earth
and
declaring
that
those
only
who
should
be
in
the
east
at
the
time
of
the
great
change
could
hope
for
greatness
in
the
new
life
that
was
now
close
at
hand
she
advised
me
whilst
there
was
yet
time
to
dispose
of
my
property
in
poor
frail
england
and
gain
a
station
in
asia
she
told
me
that
after
leaving
her
i
should
go
into
egypt
but
that
in
a
little
while
i
should
return
into
syria
i
secretly
smiled
at
this
last
prophecy
as
a
bad
shot
for
i
had
fully
determined
after
visiting
the
pyramids
to
take
ship
from
alexandria
for
greece
but
men
struggle
vainly
in
the
meshes
of
their
destiny
the
unbelieved
cassandra
was
right
after
all
the
plague
came
and
the
necessity
of
avoiding
the
quarantine
to
which
i
should
have
been
subjected
if
i
had
sailed
from
alexandria
forced
me
to
alter
my
route
i
went
down
into
egypt
and
stayed
there
for
a
time
and
then
crossed
the
desert
once
more
and
came
back
to
the
mountains
of
the
lebanon
exactly
as
the
prophetess
had
foretold
lady
hester
talked
to
me
long
and
earnestly
on
the
subject
of
religion
announcing
that
the
messiah
was
yet
to
come
she
strived
to
impress
me
with
the
vanity
and
the
falseness
of
all
european
creeds
as
well
as
with
a
sense
of
her
own
spiritual
greatness
throughout
her
conversation
upon
these
high
topics
she
carefully
insinuated
without
actually
asserting
her
heavenly
rank
amongst
other
much
more
marvellous
powers
the
lady
claimed
to
have
one
which
most
women
i
fancy
possess
namely
that
of
reading
men
s
characters
in
their
faces
she
examined
the
line
of
my
features
very
attentively
and
told
me
the
result
which
however
i
mean
to
keep
hidden
one
favoured
subject
of
discourse
was
that
of
race
upon
which
she
was
very
diffuse
and
yet
rather
mysterious
she
set
great
value
upon
the
ancient
french
not
norman
blood
for
that
she
vilified
but
did
not
at
all
appreciate
that
which
we
call
in
this
country
an
old
she
had
a
vast
idea
of
the
cornish
miners
on
account
of
their
race
and
said
if
she
chose
she
could
give
me
the
means
of
rousing
them
to
the
most
tremendous
enthusiasm
such
are
the
topics
on
which
the
lady
mainly
conversed
but
very
often
she
would
descend
to
more
worldly
chat
and
then
she
was
no
longer
the
prophetess
but
the
sort
of
woman
that
you
sometimes
see
i
am
told
in
london
decisive
in
manner
unsparing
of
enemies
full
of
audacious
fun
and
saying
the
downright
things
that
the
sheepish
society
around
her
is
afraid
to
utter
i
am
told
that
lady
hester
was
in
her
youth
a
capital
mimic
and
she
showed
me
that
not
all
the
queenly
dullness
to
which
she
had
condemned
herself
not
all
her
fasting
and
solitude
had
destroyed
this
terrible
power
the
first
whom
she
crucified
in
my
presence
was
poor
lord
byron
she
had
seen
him
it
appeared
i
know
not
where
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
east
and
was
vastly
amused
at
his
little
affectations
he
had
picked
up
a
few
sentences
of
the
romanic
with
which
he
affected
to
give
orders
to
his
greek
servant
i
can
t
tell
whether
lady
hester
s
mimicry
of
the
bard
was
at
all
close
but
it
was
amusing
she
attributed
to
him
a
curiously
coxcombical
lisp
another
person
whose
style
of
speaking
the
lady
took
off
very
amusingly
was
one
who
would
scarcely
object
to
suffer
by
the
side
of
lord
mean
lamartine
who
had
visited
her
in
the
course
of
his
travels
the
peculiarity
which
attracted
her
ridicule
was
an
of
manner
according
to
my
lady
s
imitation
of
lamartine
i
have
never
seen
him
myself
he
had
none
of
the
violent
grimace
of
his
countrymen
and
not
even
their
usual
way
of
talking
but
rather
bore
himself
mincingly
like
the
humbler
sort
of
english
dandy
lady
hester
seems
to
have
heartily
despised
everything
approaching
to
exquisiteness
she
told
me
by
the
bye
and
her
opinion
upon
that
subject
is
worth
having
that
a
downright
manner
amounting
even
to
brusqueness
is
more
effective
than
any
other
with
the
oriental
and
that
amongst
the
english
of
all
ranks
and
all
classes
there
is
no
man
so
attractive
to
the
orientals
no
man
who
can
negotiate
with
them
half
so
effectively
as
a
good
honest
and
positive
naval
officer
of
the
old
school
i
have
told
you
i
think
that
lady
hester
could
deal
fiercely
with
those
she
hated
one
man
above
all
others
he
is
now
uprooted
from
society
and
cast
away
for
ever
she
blasted
with
her
wrath
you
would
have
thought
that
in
the
scornfulness
of
her
nature
she
must
have
sprung
upon
her
foe
with
more
of
fierceness
than
of
skill
but
this
was
not
so
for
with
all
the
force
and
vehemence
of
her
invective
she
displayed
a
sober
patient
and
minute
attention
to
the
details
of
vituperation
which
contributed
to
its
success
a
thousand
times
more
than
mere
violence
during
the
hours
that
this
sort
of
conversation
or
rather
discourse
was
going
on
our
were
from
time
to
time
replenished
and
the
lady
as
well
as
i
continued
to
smoke
with
little
or
no
intermission
till
the
interview
ended
i
think
that
the
fragrant
fumes
of
the
latakiah
must
have
helped
to
keep
me
on
my
good
behaviour
as
a
patient
disciple
of
the
prophetess
it
was
not
till
after
midnight
that
my
visit
for
the
evening
came
to
an
end
when
i
quitted
my
seat
the
lady
rose
and
stood
up
in
the
same
formal
attitude
almost
that
of
a
soldier
in
a
state
of
attention
which
she
had
assumed
at
my
entrance
at
the
same
time
she
let
go
the
drapery
which
she
had
held
over
her
lap
whilst
sitting
and
allowed
it
to
fall
to
the
ground
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
i
was
visited
by
my
lady
s
only
european
except
the
doctor
whom
she
retained
in
her
household
this
secretary
like
the
doctor
was
italian
but
he
preserved
more
signs
of
european
dress
and
european
pretensions
than
his
medical
he
spoke
little
or
no
english
though
he
wrote
it
pretty
well
having
been
formerly
employed
in
a
mercantile
house
connected
with
england
the
poor
fellow
was
in
an
unhappy
state
of
mind
in
order
to
make
you
understand
the
extent
of
his
spiritual
anxieties
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
the
doctor
who
had
sunk
into
the
complete
asiatic
and
had
condescended
accordingly
to
the
performance
of
even
menial
services
had
adopted
the
common
faith
of
all
the
neighbouring
people
and
had
become
a
firm
and
happy
believer
in
the
divine
power
of
his
mistress
not
so
the
secretary
when
i
had
strolled
with
him
to
a
distance
from
the
building
which
rendered
him
safe
from
being
overheard
by
human
ears
he
told
me
in
a
hollow
voice
trembling
with
emotion
that
there
were
times
at
which
he
doubted
the
divinity
of
i
said
nothing
to
encourage
the
poor
fellow
in
that
frightful
state
of
scepticism
which
if
indulged
might
end
in
positive
infidelity
i
found
that
her
ladyship
had
rather
arbitrarily
abridged
the
amusements
of
her
secretary
forbidding
him
from
shooting
small
birds
on
the
this
oppression
had
aroused
in
him
a
spirit
of
inquiry
that
might
end
fatally
perhaps
for
himself
perhaps
for
the
religion
of
the
the
secretary
told
me
that
his
mistress
was
greatly
disliked
by
the
surrounding
people
whom
she
oppressed
by
her
exactions
and
the
truth
of
this
statement
was
borne
out
by
the
way
in
which
my
lady
spoke
to
me
of
her
neighbours
but
in
eastern
countries
hate
and
veneration
are
very
commonly
felt
for
the
same
object
and
the
general
belief
in
the
superhuman
power
of
this
wonderful
white
lady
her
resolute
and
imperious
character
and
above
all
perhaps
her
fierce
albanians
not
backward
to
obey
an
order
for
the
sacking
of
a
village
inspired
sincere
respect
amongst
the
surrounding
inhabitants
now
the
being
respected
amongst
orientals
is
not
an
empty
or
merely
honorary
distinction
but
carries
with
it
a
clear
right
to
take
your
neighbour
s
corn
his
cattle
his
eggs
and
his
honey
and
almost
anything
that
is
his
except
his
wives
this
law
was
acted
upon
by
the
princess
of
djoun
and
her
establishment
was
supplied
by
contributions
apportioned
amongst
the
nearest
of
the
villages
i
understood
that
the
albanians
restrained
i
suppose
by
the
dread
of
being
delivered
up
to
ibrahim
had
not
given
any
very
troublesome
proofs
of
their
unruly
natures
the
secretary
told
me
that
their
rations
including
a
small
allowance
of
coffee
and
tobacco
were
served
out
to
them
with
tolerable
regularity
i
asked
the
secretary
how
lady
hester
was
off
for
horses
and
said
that
i
would
take
a
look
at
the
stable
the
man
did
not
raise
any
opposition
to
my
proposal
and
affected
no
mystery
about
the
matter
but
said
that
the
only
two
steeds
which
then
belonged
to
her
ladyship
were
of
a
very
humble
sort
this
answer
and
a
storm
of
rain
then
beginning
to
descend
prevented
me
at
the
time
from
undertaking
my
journey
to
the
stable
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
part
of
the
building
in
which
i
was
quartered
and
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
thought
of
the
matter
afterwards
until
my
return
to
england
when
i
saw
lamartine
s
account
of
the
horse
saddled
by
the
hands
of
his
maker
when
i
returned
to
my
apartment
which
as
my
hostess
told
me
was
the
only
one
in
the
whole
building
that
kept
out
the
rain
her
ladyship
sent
to
say
that
she
would
be
glad
to
receive
me
again
i
was
rather
surprised
at
this
for
i
had
understood
that
she
reposed
during
the
day
and
it
was
now
little
later
than
noon
really
said
she
when
i
had
taken
my
seat
and
my
pipe
we
were
together
for
hours
last
night
and
still
i
have
heard
nothing
at
all
of
my
old
friends
now
tell
me
something
of
your
dear
mother
and
her
sister
i
never
knew
your
was
after
i
left
burton
pynsent
that
your
mother
i
began
to
make
slow
answer
but
my
questioner
soon
went
off
again
to
topics
more
sublime
so
that
this
second
interview
which
lasted
two
or
three
hours
was
occupied
by
the
same
sort
of
varied
discourse
as
that
which
i
have
been
describing
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
captain
of
an
english
arrived
at
djoun
and
her
ladyship
determined
to
receive
him
for
the
same
reason
as
that
which
had
induced
her
to
allow
my
visit
namely
an
early
intimacy
with
his
family
i
and
the
new
visitor
who
was
a
pleasant
amusing
person
dined
together
and
we
were
afterwards
invited
to
the
presence
of
my
lady
with
whom
we
sat
smoking
and
talking
till
midnight
the
conversation
turned
chiefly
i
think
upon
magical
science
i
had
determined
to
be
off
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
and
so
at
the
end
of
this
interview
i
bade
my
lady
farewell
with
her
parting
words
she
once
more
advised
me
to
abandon
europe
and
seek
my
reward
in
the
east
and
she
urged
me
too
to
give
the
like
counsels
to
my
father
and
tell
him
that
had
said
lady
hester
s
unholy
claim
to
supremacy
in
the
spiritual
kingdom
was
no
doubt
the
suggestion
of
fierce
and
inordinate
pride
most
perilously
akin
to
madness
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
mind
of
the
woman
was
too
strong
to
be
thoroughly
overcome
by
even
this
potent
feeling
i
plainly
saw
that
she
was
not
an
unhesitating
follower
of
her
own
system
and
i
even
fancied
that
i
could
distinguish
the
brief
moments
during
which
she
contrived
to
believe
in
herself
from
those
long
and
less
happy
intervals
in
which
her
own
reason
was
too
strong
for
her
as
for
the
lady
s
faith
in
astrology
and
magic
science
you
are
not
for
a
moment
to
suppose
that
this
implied
any
aberration
of
intellect
she
believed
these
things
in
common
with
those
around
her
for
she
seldom
spoke
to
anybody
except
crazy
old
dervishes
who
received
her
alms
and
fostered
her
extravagancies
and
even
when
as
on
the
occasion
of
my
visit
she
was
brought
into
contact
with
a
person
entertaining
different
notions
she
still
remained
uncontradicted
this
and
the
habit
of
fasting
from
books
and
newspapers
were
quite
enough
to
make
her
a
facile
recipient
of
any
marvellous
story
i
think
that
in
england
we
are
scarcely
sufficiently
conscious
of
the
great
debt
we
owe
to
the
wise
and
watchful
press
which
presides
over
the
formation
of
our
opinions
and
which
brings
about
this
splendid
result
namely
that
in
matters
of
belief
the
humblest
of
us
are
lifted
up
to
the
level
of
the
most
sagacious
so
that
really
a
simple
cornet
in
the
blues
is
no
more
likely
to
entertain
a
foolish
belief
about
ghosts
or
witchcraft
or
any
other
supernatural
topic
than
the
lord
high
chancellor
or
the
leader
of
the
house
of
commons
how
different
is
the
intellectual
régime
of
eastern
countries
in
syria
and
palestine
and
egypt
you
might
as
well
dispute
the
efficacy
of
grass
or
grain
as
of
magic
there
is
no
controversy
about
the
matter
the
effect
of
this
the
unanimous
belief
of
an
ignorant
people
upon
the
mind
of
a
stranger
is
extremely
curious
and
well
worth
noticing
a
man
coming
freshly
from
europe
is
at
first
proof
against
the
nonsense
with
which
he
is
assailed
but
often
it
happens
that
after
a
little
while
the
social
atmosphere
in
which
he
lives
will
begin
to
infect
him
and
if
he
has
been
unaccustomed
to
the
cunning
of
fence
by
which
reason
prepares
the
means
of
guarding
herself
against
fallacy
he
will
yield
himself
at
last
to
the
faith
of
those
around
him
and
this
he
will
do
by
sympathy
it
would
seem
rather
than
from
conviction
i
have
been
much
interested
in
observing
that
the
mere
practical
man
however
skilful
and
shrewd
in
his
own
way
has
not
the
kind
of
power
that
will
enable
him
to
resist
the
gradual
impression
made
upon
his
mind
by
the
common
opinion
of
those
whom
he
sees
and
hears
from
day
to
day
even
amongst
the
english
whose
good
sense
and
sound
religious
knowledge
would
be
likely
to
guard
them
from
error
i
have
known
the
calculating
merchant
the
inquisitive
traveller
and
the
with
his
bright
wakeful
eye
of
have
known
all
these
surrender
themselves
to
the
influence
of
other
people
s
minds
their
language
at
first
is
that
they
are
staggered
leading
you
by
that
expression
to
suppose
that
they
had
been
witnesses
to
some
phenomenon
which
it
was
very
difficult
to
account
for
otherwise
than
by
supernatural
causes
but
when
i
have
questioned
further
i
have
always
found
that
these
staggering
wonders
were
not
even
specious
enough
to
be
looked
upon
as
good
a
man
in
england
who
gained
his
whole
livelihood
as
a
conjurer
would
soon
be
starved
to
death
if
he
could
perform
no
better
miracles
than
those
which
are
wrought
with
so
much
effect
in
syria
and
egypt
no
doubt
a
magician
will
make
a
good
hit
sir
john
once
said
a
good
thing
but
all
such
successes
range
of
course
under
the
head
of
mere
tentative
miracles
as
distinguished
by
the
paley
chapter
ix
the
sanctuary
i
crossed
the
plain
of
esdraelon
and
entered
amongst
the
hills
of
beautiful
galilee
it
was
at
sunset
that
my
path
brought
me
sharply
round
into
the
gorge
of
a
little
valley
and
close
upon
a
grey
mass
of
dwellings
that
lay
happily
nestled
in
the
lap
of
the
mountain
there
was
one
only
shining
point
still
touched
with
the
light
of
the
sun
who
had
set
for
all
besides
a
brave
sign
this
to
holy
shereef
and
the
rest
of
my
moslem
men
for
the
one
glittering
summit
was
the
head
of
a
minaret
and
the
rest
of
the
seeming
village
that
had
veiled
itself
so
meekly
under
the
shades
of
evening
was
christian
nazareth
within
the
precincts
of
the
latin
convent
in
which
i
was
quartered
there
stands
the
great
catholic
church
which
encloses
the
sanctuary
the
dwelling
of
the
blessed
virgin
this
is
a
grotto
of
about
ten
feet
either
way
forming
a
little
chapel
or
recess
to
which
you
descend
by
steps
it
is
decorated
with
splendour
on
the
left
hand
a
column
of
granite
hangs
from
the
top
of
the
grotto
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
ground
immediately
beneath
it
is
another
column
of
the
same
size
which
rises
from
the
ground
as
if
to
meet
the
one
above
but
between
this
and
the
suspended
pillar
there
is
an
interval
of
more
than
a
foot
these
fragments
once
formed
a
single
column
against
which
the
angel
leant
when
he
spoke
and
told
to
mary
the
mystery
of
her
awful
blessedness
hard
by
near
the
altar
the
holy
virgin
was
kneeling
i
had
been
journeying
cheerily
indeed
for
the
voices
of
my
followers
were
ever
within
my
hearing
but
yet
as
it
were
in
solitude
for
i
had
no
comrade
to
whet
the
edge
of
my
reason
or
wake
me
from
my
noonday
dreams
i
was
left
all
alone
to
be
taught
and
swayed
by
the
beautiful
circumstances
of
palestine
the
clime
and
the
land
and
the
name
of
the
land
with
all
its
mighty
import
by
the
glittering
freshness
of
the
sward
and
the
abounding
masses
of
flowers
that
furnished
my
sumptuous
pathway
by
the
bracing
and
fragrant
air
that
seemed
to
poise
me
in
my
saddle
and
to
lift
me
along
as
a
planet
appointed
to
glide
through
space
and
the
end
of
my
journey
was
nazareth
the
home
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
the
first
dawn
of
my
manhood
the
old
painters
of
italy
had
taught
me
their
dangerous
worship
of
the
beauty
that
is
more
than
mortal
but
those
images
all
seemed
shadowy
now
and
floated
before
me
so
dimly
the
one
overcasting
the
other
that
they
left
me
no
one
sweet
idol
on
which
i
could
look
and
look
again
and
say
maria
mia
yet
they
left
me
more
than
an
idol
they
left
me
for
to
them
i
am
wont
to
trace
it
a
faint
apprehension
of
beauty
not
compassed
with
lines
and
shadows
they
touched
me
forgive
proud
marie
of
anjou
touched
me
with
a
faith
in
loveliness
transcending
mortal
shapes
i
came
to
nazareth
and
was
led
from
the
convent
to
the
sanctuary
long
fasting
will
sometimes
heat
my
brain
and
draw
me
away
out
of
the
disturb
my
judgment
confuse
my
notions
of
right
and
wrong
and
weaken
my
power
of
choosing
the
right
i
had
fasted
perhaps
too
long
for
i
was
fevered
with
the
zeal
of
an
insane
devotion
to
the
heavenly
queen
of
christendom
but
i
knew
the
feebleness
of
this
gentle
malady
and
knew
how
easily
my
watchful
reason
if
ever
so
slightly
provoked
would
drag
me
back
to
life
let
there
but
come
one
chilling
breath
of
the
outer
world
and
all
this
loving
piety
would
cower
and
fly
before
the
sound
of
my
own
bitter
laugh
and
so
as
i
went
i
trod
tenderly
not
looking
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
bending
my
eyes
to
the
ground
the
attending
friar
served
me
well
he
led
me
down
quietly
and
all
but
silently
to
the
virgin
s
home
the
mystic
air
was
so
burnt
with
the
consuming
flames
of
the
altar
and
so
laden
with
incense
that
my
chest
laboured
strongly
and
heaved
with
luscious
pain
with
beating
heart
the
virgin
knelt
and
listened
i
strived
to
grasp
and
hold
with
my
riveted
eyes
some
one
of
the
feigned
madonnas
but
of
all
the
faces
imagined
by
men
there
was
none
that
would
abide
with
me
in
this
the
very
sanctuary
impatient
of
vacancy
i
grew
madly
strong
against
nature
and
if
by
some
awful
spell
some
impious
rite
i
most
sweet
religion
that
bid
me
fear
god
and
be
pious
and
yet
not
cease
from
loving
religion
and
gracious
custom
commanded
me
that
i
fall
down
loyally
and
kiss
the
rock
that
blessed
mary
pressed
with
a
half
consciousness
with
the
semblance
of
a
thrilling
hope
that
i
was
plunging
deep
deep
into
my
first
knowledge
of
some
most
holy
mystery
or
of
some
new
rapturous
and
daring
sin
i
knelt
and
bowed
down
my
face
till
i
met
the
smooth
rock
with
my
lips
one
moment
my
heart
or
some
old
pagan
demon
within
me
woke
up
and
fiercely
bounded
my
bosom
was
lifted
and
swung
as
though
i
had
touched
her
warm
robe
one
moment
one
more
and
then
the
fever
had
left
me
i
rose
from
my
knees
i
felt
hopelessly
sane
the
mere
world
reappeared
my
good
old
monk
was
there
dangling
his
key
with
listless
patience
and
as
he
guided
me
from
the
church
and
talked
of
the
refectory
and
the
coming
repast
i
listened
to
his
words
with
some
attention
and
pleasure
chapter
x
the
monks
of
palestine
whenever
you
come
back
to
me
from
palestine
we
will
find
some
golden
wine
of
lebanon
that
we
may
celebrate
with
apt
libations
the
monks
of
the
holy
land
and
though
the
poor
fellows
be
theoretically
dead
to
the
world
we
will
drink
to
every
man
of
them
a
good
long
life
and
a
merry
one
graceless
is
the
traveller
who
forgets
his
obligations
to
these
saints
upon
earth
little
love
has
he
for
merry
christendom
if
he
has
not
rejoiced
with
great
joy
to
find
in
the
very
midst
of
infidels
those
lowly
monasteries
in
which
the
blessed
juice
of
the
grape
is
quaffed
in
peace
ay
ay
we
will
fill
our
glasses
till
they
look
like
cups
of
amber
and
drink
profoundly
to
our
gracious
hosts
in
palestine
christianity
permits
and
sanctions
the
drinking
of
wine
and
of
all
the
holy
brethren
in
palestine
there
are
none
who
hold
fast
to
this
gladsome
rite
so
strenuously
as
the
monks
of
damascus
not
that
they
are
more
zealous
christians
than
the
rest
of
their
fellows
in
the
holy
land
but
that
they
have
better
wine
whilst
i
was
at
damascus
i
had
my
quarters
at
the
franciscan
convent
there
and
very
soon
after
my
arrival
i
asked
one
of
the
monks
to
let
me
know
something
of
the
spots
that
deserved
to
be
seen
i
made
my
inquiry
in
reference
to
the
associations
with
which
the
city
had
been
hallowed
by
the
sojourn
and
adventures
of
paul
there
is
nothing
in
all
damascus
said
the
good
man
half
so
well
worth
seeing
as
our
cellars
and
forthwith
he
invited
me
to
go
see
and
admire
the
long
range
of
liquid
treasure
that
he
and
his
brethren
had
laid
up
for
themselves
on
earth
and
these
i
soon
found
were
not
as
the
treasures
of
the
miser
that
lie
in
unprofitable
disuse
for
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
the
golden
juice
ascended
from
the
dark
recesses
of
the
cellar
to
the
uppermost
brains
of
the
friars
dear
old
fellows
in
the
midst
of
that
solemn
land
their
christian
laughter
rang
loudly
and
merrily
their
eyes
kept
flashing
with
joyous
bonfires
and
their
heavy
woollen
petticoats
could
no
more
weigh
down
the
springiness
of
their
paces
than
the
filmy
gauze
of
a
can
clog
her
bounding
step
you
would
be
likely
enough
to
fancy
that
these
monastics
are
men
who
have
retired
to
the
sacred
sites
of
palestine
from
an
enthusiastic
longing
to
devote
themselves
to
the
exercise
of
religion
in
the
midst
of
the
very
land
on
which
its
first
seeds
were
cast
and
this
is
partially
at
least
the
case
with
the
monks
of
the
greek
church
but
it
is
not
with
enthusiasts
that
the
catholic
establishments
are
filled
the
monks
of
the
latin
convents
are
chiefly
persons
of
the
peasant
class
from
italy
and
spain
who
have
been
handed
over
to
these
remote
asylums
by
order
of
their
ecclesiastical
superiors
and
can
no
more
account
for
their
being
in
the
holy
land
than
men
of
marching
regiments
can
explain
why
they
are
in
stupid
i
believe
that
these
monks
are
for
the
most
part
well
conducted
men
punctual
in
their
ceremonial
duties
and
altogether
christians
their
humility
is
not
at
all
misplaced
for
you
see
at
a
glance
poor
fellows
that
they
belong
to
the
of
the
human
race
if
the
taking
of
the
cowl
does
not
imply
a
complete
renouncement
of
the
world
it
is
at
least
in
these
days
a
thorough
farewell
to
every
kind
of
useful
and
entertaining
knowledge
and
accordingly
the
low
bestial
brow
and
the
animal
caste
of
those
almost
bourbon
features
show
plainly
enough
that
all
the
intellectual
vanities
of
life
have
been
really
and
truly
abandoned
but
it
is
hard
to
quench
altogether
the
spirit
of
inquiry
that
stirs
in
the
human
breast
and
accordingly
these
monks
are
for
news
poor
fellows
they
could
scarcely
have
yielded
themselves
to
the
sway
of
any
passion
more
difficult
of
gratification
for
they
have
no
means
of
communicating
with
the
busy
world
except
through
european
travellers
and
these
in
consequence
i
suppose
of
that
restlessness
and
irritability
that
generally
haunt
their
wanderings
seem
to
have
always
avoided
the
bore
of
giving
any
information
to
their
hosts
as
for
me
i
am
more
patient
and
and
when
i
found
that
the
kind
monks
who
gathered
round
me
at
nazareth
were
longing
to
know
the
real
truth
about
the
general
bonaparte
who
had
recoiled
from
the
siege
of
acre
i
softened
my
heart
down
to
the
good
humour
of
herodotus
and
calmly
began
to
sing
history
telling
my
eager
hearers
of
the
french
empire
and
the
greatness
of
its
glory
and
of
waterloo
and
the
fall
of
napoleon
now
my
story
of
this
marvellous
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
poor
monks
is
one
upon
which
though
depending
on
my
own
testimony
i
look
with
considerable
it
is
quite
true
how
silly
it
would
be
to
invent
anything
so
witless
and
yet
i
think
i
could
satisfy
the
mind
of
a
reasonable
man
that
it
is
false
many
of
the
older
monks
must
have
been
in
europe
at
the
time
when
the
italy
and
the
spain
from
which
they
came
were
in
act
of
taking
their
french
lessons
or
had
parted
so
lately
with
their
teachers
that
not
to
know
of
the
emperor
was
impossible
and
these
men
could
scarcely
therefore
have
failed
to
bring
with
them
some
tidings
of
napoleon
s
career
yet
i
say
that
that
which
i
have
written
is
one
who
believes
because
i
have
said
it
will
be
right
she
always
is
whilst
poor
reasonable
man
who
is
convinced
by
the
weight
of
my
argument
will
be
completely
deceived
in
spanish
politics
however
the
monks
are
better
instructed
the
revenues
of
the
monasteries
which
had
been
principally
supplied
by
the
bounty
of
their
most
catholic
majesties
have
been
withheld
since
ferdinand
s
death
and
the
interests
of
these
establishments
being
thus
closely
involved
in
the
destinies
of
spain
it
is
not
wonderful
that
the
brethren
should
be
a
little
more
knowing
in
spanish
affairs
than
in
other
branches
of
history
besides
a
large
proportion
of
the
monks
were
natives
of
the
peninsula
to
these
i
remember
mysseri
s
familiarity
with
the
spanish
language
and
character
was
a
source
of
immense
delight
they
were
always
gathering
around
him
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
treasured
like
gold
the
few
castilian
words
which
he
deigned
to
spare
them
the
monks
do
a
world
of
good
in
their
way
and
there
can
be
no
doubting
that
previously
to
the
arrival
of
bishop
alexander
with
his
numerous
young
family
and
his
pretty
english
nursemaids
they
were
the
chief
propagandists
of
christianity
in
palestine
my
old
friends
of
the
franciscan
convent
at
jerusalem
some
time
since
gave
proof
of
their
goodness
by
delivering
themselves
up
to
the
peril
of
death
for
the
sake
of
duty
when
i
was
their
guest
they
were
forty
i
believe
in
number
and
i
don
t
recollect
that
there
was
one
of
them
whom
i
should
have
looked
upon
as
a
desirable
of
any
property
to
which
i
might
be
entitled
in
expectancy
yet
these
forty
were
reduced
in
a
few
days
to
nineteen
the
plague
was
the
messenger
that
summoned
them
to
a
taste
of
real
death
but
the
circumstances
under
which
they
perished
are
rather
curious
and
though
i
have
no
authority
for
the
story
except
an
italian
newspaper
i
harbour
no
doubt
of
its
truth
for
the
facts
were
detailed
with
minuteness
and
strictly
corresponded
with
all
that
i
knew
of
the
poor
fellows
to
whom
they
related
it
was
about
three
months
after
the
time
of
my
leaving
jerusalem
that
the
plague
set
his
spotted
foot
on
the
holy
city
the
monks
felt
great
alarm
they
did
not
shrink
from
their
duty
but
for
its
performance
they
chose
a
plan
most
sadly
well
fitted
for
bringing
down
upon
them
the
very
death
which
they
were
striving
to
ward
off
they
imagined
themselves
almost
safe
so
long
as
they
remained
within
their
walls
but
then
it
was
quite
needful
that
the
catholic
christians
of
the
place
who
had
always
looked
to
the
convent
for
the
supply
of
their
spiritual
wants
should
receive
the
aids
of
religion
in
the
hour
of
death
a
single
monk
therefore
was
chosen
either
by
lot
or
by
some
other
fair
appeal
to
destiny
being
thus
singled
out
he
was
to
go
forth
into
the
city
and
to
perform
with
exactness
his
priestly
duties
then
he
was
to
return
not
to
the
interior
of
the
convent
for
fear
of
infecting
his
brethren
but
to
a
detached
building
which
i
remember
belonging
to
the
establishment
but
at
some
little
distance
from
the
inhabited
rooms
he
was
provided
with
a
bell
and
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
morning
he
was
ordered
to
ring
it
he
but
if
no
sound
was
heard
at
the
appointed
time
then
knew
his
brethren
that
he
was
either
delirious
or
dead
and
another
martyr
was
sent
forth
to
take
his
place
in
this
way
of
the
monks
were
carried
off
one
can
not
well
fail
to
admire
the
steadiness
with
which
the
dismal
scheme
was
carried
through
but
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
notion
that
disease
may
be
invited
by
a
frightening
imagination
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
more
dangerous
plan
than
that
which
was
chosen
by
these
poor
fellows
the
anxiety
with
which
they
must
have
expected
each
day
the
sound
of
the
bell
the
silence
that
reigned
instead
of
it
and
then
the
drawing
of
the
lots
the
odds
against
death
being
one
point
lower
than
yesterday
and
the
going
forth
of
the
this
must
have
widened
the
gulf
that
opens
to
the
shades
below
when
his
victim
had
already
suffered
so
much
of
mental
torture
it
was
but
easy
work
for
big
bullying
pestilence
to
follow
a
forlorn
monk
from
the
beds
of
the
dying
and
wrench
away
his
life
from
him
as
he
lay
all
alone
in
an
outhouse
in
most
i
believe
in
all
of
the
holy
land
convents
there
are
two
personages
so
strangely
raised
above
their
brethren
in
all
that
dignifies
humanity
that
their
bearing
the
same
habit
their
dwelling
under
the
same
roof
their
worshipping
the
same
god
consistent
as
all
this
is
with
the
spirit
of
their
religion
yet
strikes
the
mind
with
a
sense
of
wondrous
incongruity
the
men
i
speak
of
are
the
padre
superiore
and
the
padre
the
former
is
the
supreme
and
absolute
governor
of
the
establishment
over
which
he
is
appointed
to
rule
the
latter
is
entrusted
with
the
more
active
of
the
spiritual
duties
attaching
to
the
pilgrim
church
he
is
the
shepherd
of
the
good
catholic
flock
whose
pasture
is
prepared
in
the
midst
of
mussulmans
and
schismatics
he
keeps
the
light
of
the
true
faith
ever
vividly
before
their
eyes
reproves
their
vices
supports
them
in
their
good
resolves
consoles
them
in
their
afflictions
and
teaches
them
to
hate
the
greek
church
such
are
his
labours
and
you
may
conceive
that
great
tact
must
be
needed
for
conducting
with
success
the
spiritual
interests
of
the
church
under
circumstances
so
odd
as
those
which
surround
it
in
palestine
but
the
position
of
the
padre
superiore
is
still
more
delicate
he
is
almost
unceasingly
in
treaty
with
the
powers
that
be
and
the
worldly
prosperity
of
the
establishment
over
which
he
presides
is
in
great
measure
dependent
upon
the
extent
of
diplomatic
skill
which
he
can
employ
in
its
favour
i
know
not
from
what
class
of
churchmen
these
personages
are
chosen
for
there
is
a
mystery
attending
their
origin
and
the
circumstance
of
their
being
stationed
in
these
convents
which
rome
does
not
suffer
to
be
penetrated
i
have
heard
it
said
that
they
are
men
of
great
note
and
perhaps
of
too
high
ambition
in
the
catholic
hierarchy
who
having
fallen
under
the
grave
censure
of
the
church
are
banished
for
fixed
periods
to
these
distant
monasteries
i
believe
that
the
term
during
which
they
are
condemned
to
remain
in
the
holy
land
is
from
eight
to
twelve
years
by
the
natives
of
the
country
as
well
as
by
the
rest
of
the
brethren
they
are
looked
upon
as
superior
beings
and
rightly
too
for
nature
seems
to
have
crowned
them
in
her
own
true
way
the
chief
of
the
jerusalem
convent
was
a
noble
creature
his
worldly
and
spiritual
authority
seemed
to
have
surrounded
him
as
it
were
with
a
kind
of
court
and
the
manly
gracefulness
of
his
bearing
did
honour
to
the
throne
which
he
filled
there
were
no
lords
of
the
bedchamber
and
no
gold
sticks
and
stones
in
waiting
yet
everybody
who
approached
him
looked
as
though
he
were
being
presented
every
interview
which
he
granted
wore
the
air
of
an
audience
the
brethren
as
often
as
they
came
near
bowed
low
and
kissed
his
hand
and
if
he
went
out
the
catholics
of
the
place
that
hovered
about
the
convent
would
crowd
around
him
with
devout
affection
and
almost
scramble
for
the
blessing
which
his
touch
could
give
he
bore
his
honours
all
serenely
as
though
calmly
conscious
of
his
power
to
bind
and
to
chapter
xi
galilee
neither
old
sacred
himself
nor
any
of
his
helpers
knew
the
road
which
i
meant
to
take
from
nazareth
to
the
sea
of
galilee
and
from
thence
to
jerusalem
so
i
was
forced
to
add
another
to
my
party
by
hiring
a
guide
the
associations
of
nazareth
as
well
as
my
kind
feeling
towards
the
hospitable
monks
whose
guest
i
had
been
inclined
me
to
set
at
naught
the
advice
which
i
had
received
against
employing
christians
i
accordingly
engaged
a
lithe
active
young
nazarene
who
was
recommended
to
me
by
the
monks
and
who
affected
to
be
familiar
with
the
line
of
country
through
which
i
intended
to
pass
my
disregard
of
the
popular
prejudices
against
christians
was
not
justified
in
this
particular
instance
by
the
result
of
my
choice
this
you
will
see
by
and
by
i
passed
by
cana
and
the
house
in
which
the
water
had
been
turned
into
wine
i
came
to
the
field
in
which
our
saviour
had
rebuked
the
scotch
of
that
period
by
suffering
his
disciples
to
pluck
corn
on
the
lord
s
day
i
rode
over
the
ground
on
which
the
fainting
multitude
had
been
fed
and
they
showed
me
some
massive
relics
they
said
of
that
wondrous
banquet
now
turned
into
stone
the
petrifaction
was
most
complete
i
ascended
the
height
on
which
our
lord
was
standing
when
he
wrought
the
miracle
the
hill
was
lofty
enough
to
show
me
the
fairness
of
the
land
on
all
sides
but
i
have
an
ancient
love
for
the
mere
features
of
a
lake
and
so
forgetting
all
else
when
i
reached
the
summit
i
looked
away
eagerly
to
the
eastward
there
she
lay
the
sea
of
galilee
less
stern
than
wast
water
less
fair
than
gentle
windermere
she
had
still
the
winning
ways
of
an
english
lake
she
caught
from
the
smiling
heavens
unceasing
light
and
changeful
phases
of
beauty
and
with
all
this
brightness
on
her
face
she
yet
clung
so
fondly
to
the
dull
mountain
at
her
side
as
though
she
would
soothe
him
with
her
finer
fancies
touch
him
with
her
lighter
if
one
might
judge
of
men
s
real
thoughts
by
their
writings
it
would
seem
that
there
are
people
who
can
visit
an
interesting
locality
and
follow
up
continuously
the
exact
train
of
thought
that
ought
to
be
suggested
by
the
historical
associations
of
the
place
a
person
of
this
sort
can
go
to
athens
and
think
of
nothing
later
than
the
age
of
pericles
can
live
with
the
scipios
as
long
as
he
stays
in
rome
can
go
up
in
a
balloon
and
think
how
resplendently
in
former
times
the
now
vacant
and
desolate
air
was
peopled
with
angels
how
prettily
it
was
crossed
at
intervals
by
the
rounds
of
jacob
s
ladder
i
don
t
possess
this
power
at
all
it
is
only
by
snatches
and
for
few
moments
together
that
i
can
really
associate
a
place
with
its
proper
history
there
at
tiberias
and
along
this
western
shore
towards
the
north
and
upon
the
bosom
too
of
the
lake
our
saviour
and
his
disciples
flew
those
recollections
and
my
mind
strained
eastward
because
that
that
farthest
shore
was
the
end
of
the
world
that
belongs
to
man
the
dweller
the
beginning
of
the
other
and
veiled
world
that
is
held
by
the
strange
race
whose
life
like
the
pastime
of
satan
is
a
going
to
and
fro
upon
the
face
of
the
from
those
grey
hills
right
away
to
the
gates
of
bagdad
stretched
forth
the
mysterious
desert
a
pale
void
sandy
tract
but
a
land
abounding
in
rich
pastures
a
land
without
cities
or
towns
without
any
respectable
people
or
any
respectable
things
yet
yielding
its
eighty
thousand
cavalry
to
the
beck
of
a
few
old
men
but
once
plain
of
very
earth
on
which
i
the
deep
low
tones
of
the
saviour
s
voice
should
have
gone
forth
into
eternity
from
out
of
the
midst
of
these
hills
and
these
valleys
ay
but
yet
again
the
calm
face
of
the
lake
was
uplifted
and
smiled
upon
my
eyes
with
such
familiar
gaze
that
the
deep
low
tones
were
hushed
the
listening
multitudes
all
passed
away
and
instead
there
came
to
me
a
dear
old
memory
from
over
the
seas
in
england
a
memory
sweeter
than
gospel
to
that
poor
wilful
mortal
me
i
went
to
tiberias
and
soon
got
afloat
upon
the
water
in
the
evening
i
took
up
my
quarters
in
the
catholic
church
and
the
building
being
large
enough
the
whole
of
my
party
were
admitted
to
the
benefit
of
the
same
shelter
with
portmanteaus
and
carpet
bags
and
books
and
maps
and
fragrant
tea
mysseri
soon
made
me
a
home
on
the
southern
side
of
the
church
one
of
old
shereef
s
helpers
was
an
enthusiastic
catholic
and
was
greatly
delighted
at
having
so
sacred
a
lodging
he
lit
up
the
altar
with
a
number
of
tapers
and
when
his
preparations
were
complete
he
began
to
perform
his
orisons
in
the
strangest
manner
imaginable
his
lips
muttered
the
prayers
of
the
latin
church
but
he
bowed
himself
down
and
laid
his
forehead
to
the
stones
beneath
him
after
the
manner
of
a
mussulman
the
universal
aptness
of
a
religious
system
for
all
stages
of
civilisation
and
for
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
well
befits
its
claim
of
divine
origin
she
is
of
all
nations
and
of
all
times
that
wonderful
church
of
rome
tiberias
is
one
of
the
four
holy
cities
according
to
the
talmud
and
it
is
from
this
place
or
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
it
that
the
messiah
is
to
arise
except
at
jerusalem
never
think
of
attempting
to
sleep
in
a
holy
old
jews
from
all
parts
of
the
world
go
to
lay
their
bones
upon
the
sacred
soil
and
as
these
people
never
return
to
their
homes
it
follows
that
any
domestic
vermin
which
they
may
bring
with
them
are
likely
to
become
permanently
resident
so
that
the
population
is
continually
increasing
no
recent
census
had
been
taken
when
i
was
at
tiberias
but
i
know
that
the
congregation
of
fleas
which
attended
at
my
church
alone
must
have
been
something
enormous
it
was
a
carnal
congregation
wholly
inattentive
to
the
service
which
was
going
on
and
devoted
to
the
one
object
of
having
my
blood
the
fleas
of
all
nations
were
there
the
smug
steady
importunate
flea
from
holywell
street
the
pert
jumping
from
hungry
france
the
wary
watchful
with
his
poisoned
stiletto
the
vengeful
of
castile
with
his
ugly
knife
the
german
with
his
knife
and
fork
insatiate
not
rising
from
table
whole
swarms
from
all
the
russias
and
asiatic
hordes
these
were
there
and
all
rejoiced
in
one
great
international
feast
i
could
no
more
defend
myself
against
my
enemies
than
if
i
had
been
à
in
the
hands
of
a
french
patriot
or
english
gold
in
the
claws
of
a
pennsylvanian
quaker
after
passing
a
night
like
this
you
are
glad
to
pick
up
the
wretched
remains
of
your
body
long
long
before
morning
dawns
your
skin
is
scorched
your
temples
throb
your
lips
feel
withered
and
dried
your
burning
eyeballs
are
screwed
inwards
against
the
brain
you
have
no
hope
but
only
in
the
saddle
and
the
freshness
of
the
morning
air
chapter
xii
my
first
bivouac
the
course
of
the
jordan
is
from
the
north
to
the
south
and
in
that
direction
with
very
little
of
devious
winding
it
carries
the
shining
waters
of
galilee
straight
down
into
the
solitudes
of
the
dead
sea
speaking
roughly
the
river
in
that
meridian
is
a
boundary
between
the
people
living
under
roofs
and
the
tented
tribes
that
wander
on
the
farther
side
and
so
as
i
went
down
in
my
way
from
tiberias
towards
jerusalem
along
the
western
bank
of
the
stream
my
thinking
all
propended
to
the
ancient
world
of
herdsmen
and
warriors
that
lay
so
close
over
my
bridle
arm
if
a
man
and
an
englishman
be
not
born
of
his
mother
with
a
natural
in
his
mouth
there
comes
to
him
a
time
for
loathing
the
wearisome
ways
of
society
a
time
for
not
liking
tamed
people
a
time
for
not
dancing
quadrilles
not
sitting
in
pews
a
time
for
pretending
that
milton
and
shelley
and
all
sorts
of
mere
dead
people
were
greater
in
death
than
the
first
living
lord
of
the
treasury
a
time
in
short
for
scoffing
and
railing
for
speaking
lightly
of
the
very
opera
and
all
our
most
cherished
institutions
it
is
from
nineteen
to
two
or
three
and
twenty
perhaps
that
this
war
of
the
man
against
men
is
like
to
be
waged
most
sullenly
you
are
yet
in
this
smiling
england
but
you
find
yourself
wending
away
to
the
dark
sides
of
her
mountains
climbing
the
dizzy
crags
exulting
in
the
fellowship
of
mists
and
clouds
and
watching
the
storms
how
they
gather
or
proving
the
mettle
of
your
mare
upon
the
broad
and
dreary
downs
because
that
you
feel
congenially
with
the
yet
unparcelled
earth
a
little
while
you
are
free
and
unlabelled
like
the
ground
that
you
compass
but
civilisation
is
coming
and
coming
you
and
your
waste
lands
will
be
surely
enclosed
and
sooner
or
later
brought
down
to
a
state
of
mere
usefulness
the
ground
will
be
curiously
sliced
into
acres
and
roods
and
perches
and
you
for
all
you
sit
so
smartly
in
your
saddle
you
will
be
caught
you
will
be
taken
up
from
travel
as
a
colt
from
grass
to
be
trained
and
tried
and
matched
and
run
all
this
in
time
but
first
come
continental
tours
and
the
moody
longing
for
eastern
travel
the
downs
and
the
moors
of
england
can
hold
you
no
longer
with
large
strides
you
burst
away
from
these
slips
and
patches
of
free
land
you
thread
your
path
through
the
crowds
of
europe
and
at
last
on
the
banks
of
jordan
you
joyfully
know
that
you
are
upon
the
very
frontier
of
all
accustomed
respectabilities
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
you
can
swim
it
with
one
arm
there
reigns
the
people
that
will
be
like
to
put
you
to
death
for
being
a
vagrant
for
being
a
robber
for
being
armed
and
houseless
there
is
comfort
in
comfort
and
strength
to
one
who
is
dying
from
very
weariness
of
that
poor
dear
deserving
accomplished
pedantic
and
painstaking
governess
europe
i
had
ridden
for
some
hours
along
the
right
bank
of
jordan
when
i
came
to
the
djesr
el
medjamé
an
old
roman
bridge
i
believe
which
crossed
the
river
my
nazarene
guide
was
riding
ahead
of
the
party
and
now
to
my
surprise
and
delight
he
turned
leftwards
and
led
on
over
the
bridge
i
knew
that
the
true
road
to
jerusalem
must
be
mainly
by
the
right
bank
of
jordan
but
i
supposed
that
my
guide
was
crossing
the
bridge
at
this
spot
in
order
to
avoid
some
bend
in
the
river
and
that
he
knew
of
a
ford
lower
down
by
which
we
should
regain
the
western
bank
i
made
no
question
about
the
road
for
i
was
but
too
glad
to
set
my
horse
s
hoofs
upon
the
land
of
the
wandering
tribes
none
of
my
party
except
the
nazarene
knew
the
country
on
we
went
through
rich
pastures
upon
the
eastern
side
of
the
water
i
looked
for
the
expected
bend
of
the
river
but
far
as
i
could
see
it
kept
a
straight
southerly
course
i
still
left
my
guide
unquestioned
the
jordan
is
not
a
perfectly
accurate
boundary
betwixt
roofs
and
tents
for
soon
after
passing
the
bridge
i
came
upon
a
cluster
of
huts
some
time
afterwards
the
guide
upon
being
closely
questioned
by
my
servants
confessed
that
the
village
which
we
had
left
behind
was
the
last
that
we
should
see
but
he
declared
that
he
knew
a
spot
at
which
we
should
find
an
encampment
of
friendly
bedouins
who
would
receive
me
with
all
hospitality
i
had
long
determined
not
to
leave
the
east
without
seeing
something
of
the
wandering
tribes
but
i
had
looked
forward
to
this
as
a
pleasure
to
be
found
in
the
desert
between
el
arish
and
egypt
i
had
no
idea
that
the
bedouins
on
the
east
of
jordan
were
accessible
my
delight
was
so
great
at
the
near
prospect
of
bread
and
salt
in
the
tent
of
an
arab
warrior
that
i
wilfully
allowed
my
guide
to
go
on
and
mislead
me
i
saw
that
he
was
taking
me
out
of
the
straight
route
towards
jerusalem
and
was
drawing
me
into
the
midst
of
the
bedouins
but
the
idea
of
his
betraying
me
seemed
i
know
not
why
so
utterly
absurd
that
i
could
not
entertain
it
for
a
moment
i
fancied
it
possible
that
the
fellow
had
taken
me
out
of
my
route
in
order
to
attempt
some
little
mercantile
enterprise
with
the
tribe
for
which
he
was
seeking
and
i
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
which
i
might
thus
gain
of
coming
in
contact
with
the
wanderers
not
long
after
passing
the
village
a
horseman
met
us
it
appeared
that
some
of
the
cavalry
of
ibrahim
pasha
had
crossed
the
river
for
the
sake
of
the
rich
pastures
on
the
eastern
bank
and
that
this
man
was
one
of
the
troopers
he
stopped
and
saluted
he
was
obviously
surprised
at
meeting
an
unarmed
or
cavalcade
and
at
last
fairly
told
us
that
we
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
and
that
if
we
proceeded
we
must
lay
our
account
with
falling
amongst
robbers
all
this
while
and
throughout
the
day
my
nazarene
kept
well
ahead
of
the
party
and
was
constantly
up
in
his
stirrups
straining
forward
and
searching
the
distance
for
some
objects
which
still
remained
unseen
for
the
rest
of
the
day
we
saw
no
human
being
we
pushed
on
eagerly
in
the
hope
of
coming
up
with
the
bedouins
before
nightfall
night
came
and
we
still
went
on
in
our
way
till
about
ten
o
clock
then
the
thorough
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
weariness
of
our
beasts
which
had
already
done
two
good
days
journey
in
one
forced
us
to
determine
upon
coming
to
a
standstill
upon
the
heights
to
the
eastward
we
saw
lights
these
shone
from
caves
on
the
inhabited
as
the
nazarene
told
us
by
rascals
of
a
low
real
bedouins
men
whom
we
might
frighten
into
harmlessness
but
from
whom
there
was
no
willing
hospitality
to
be
expected
we
heard
at
a
little
distance
the
brawling
of
a
rivulet
and
on
the
banks
of
this
it
was
determined
to
establish
our
bivouac
we
soon
found
the
stream
and
following
its
course
for
a
few
yards
came
to
a
spot
which
was
thought
to
be
fit
for
our
purpose
it
was
a
sharply
cold
night
in
february
and
when
i
dismounted
i
found
myself
standing
upon
some
wet
rank
herbage
that
promised
ill
for
the
comfort
of
our
i
had
bad
hopes
of
a
fire
for
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
night
was
a
great
obstacle
to
any
successful
search
for
fuel
and
besides
the
boughs
of
trees
or
bushes
would
be
so
full
of
sap
in
this
early
spring
that
they
would
not
be
easily
persuaded
to
burn
however
we
were
not
likely
to
submit
to
a
dark
and
cold
bivouac
without
an
effort
and
my
fellows
groped
forward
through
the
darkness
till
after
advancing
a
few
paces
they
were
happily
stopped
by
a
complete
barrier
of
dead
prickly
bushes
before
our
swords
could
be
drawn
to
reap
this
welcome
harvest
it
was
found
to
our
surprise
that
the
fuel
was
already
hewn
and
strewed
along
the
ground
in
a
thick
mass
a
spot
for
the
fire
was
found
with
some
difficulty
for
the
earth
was
moist
and
the
grass
high
and
rank
at
last
there
was
a
clicking
of
flint
and
steel
and
presently
there
stood
out
from
darkness
one
of
the
tawny
faces
of
my
muleteers
bent
down
to
near
the
ground
and
suddenly
lit
up
by
the
glowing
of
the
spark
which
he
courted
with
careful
breath
before
long
there
was
a
particle
of
dry
fibre
or
leaf
that
kindled
to
a
tiny
flame
then
another
was
lit
from
that
and
then
another
then
small
crisp
twigs
little
bigger
than
bodkins
were
laid
athwart
the
glowing
fire
the
swelling
cheeks
of
the
muleteer
laid
level
with
the
earth
blew
tenderly
at
first
and
then
more
boldly
upon
the
young
flame
which
was
daintily
nursed
and
fed
and
fed
more
plentifully
when
it
gained
good
strength
at
last
a
whole
armful
of
dry
bushes
was
piled
up
over
the
fire
and
presently
with
a
loud
cheery
crackling
and
crackling
a
royal
tall
blaze
shot
up
from
the
earth
and
showed
me
once
more
the
shapes
and
faces
of
my
men
and
the
dim
outlines
of
the
horses
and
mules
that
stood
grazing
hard
by
my
servants
busied
themselves
in
unpacking
the
baggage
as
though
we
had
arrived
at
an
and
his
helpers
unsaddled
their
cattle
we
had
left
tiberias
without
the
slightest
idea
that
we
were
to
make
our
way
to
jerusalem
along
the
desolate
side
of
the
jordan
and
my
servants
generally
provident
in
those
matters
had
brought
with
them
only
i
think
some
unleavened
bread
and
a
rocky
fragment
of
goat
cheese
these
treasures
were
produced
tea
and
the
contrivances
for
making
it
were
always
a
standing
part
of
my
baggage
my
men
gathered
in
circle
round
the
fire
the
nazarene
was
in
a
false
position
from
having
misled
us
so
strangely
and
he
would
have
shrunk
back
poor
devil
into
the
cold
and
outer
darkness
but
i
made
him
draw
near
and
share
the
luxuries
of
the
night
my
quilt
and
my
pelisse
were
spread
and
the
rest
of
my
party
had
all
their
capotes
or
pelisses
or
robes
of
some
sort
which
furnished
their
couches
the
men
gathered
in
circle
some
kneeling
some
sitting
some
lying
reclined
around
our
common
hearth
sometimes
on
one
sometimes
on
another
the
flickering
light
would
glare
more
fiercely
sometimes
it
was
the
good
shereef
that
seemed
the
foremost
as
he
sat
with
venerable
beard
the
image
of
manly
of
all
geography
unknowing
where
he
was
or
whither
he
might
go
but
trusting
in
the
goodness
of
god
and
the
clinching
power
of
fate
and
the
good
star
of
the
englishman
sometimes
like
marble
the
classic
face
of
the
greek
mysseri
would
catch
the
sudden
light
and
then
again
by
turns
the
dthemetri
with
his
old
chinaman
s
eye
and
bristling
moustache
shone
forth
illustrious
i
always
liked
the
men
who
attended
me
on
these
eastern
travels
for
they
were
all
of
them
brave
fellows
and
although
their
following
my
career
brought
upon
them
a
pretty
large
share
of
those
toils
and
hardships
which
are
so
much
more
amusing
to
gentlemen
than
to
servants
yet
not
one
of
them
ever
uttered
or
hinted
a
syllable
of
complaint
or
even
affected
to
put
on
an
air
of
resignation
i
always
liked
them
but
never
perhaps
so
much
as
when
they
were
thus
grouped
together
under
the
light
of
the
bivouac
fire
i
felt
towards
them
as
my
comrades
rather
than
as
my
servants
and
took
delight
in
breaking
bread
with
them
and
merrily
passing
the
cup
the
love
of
tea
is
a
glad
source
of
between
the
englishman
and
the
asiatic
in
persia
it
is
drunk
by
all
and
although
it
is
a
luxury
that
is
rarely
within
the
reach
of
the
osmanlees
there
are
few
of
them
who
do
not
know
and
love
the
blessed
our
filled
from
the
brook
hummed
doubtfully
for
a
while
then
busily
bubbled
under
the
sidelong
glare
of
the
flames
cups
clinked
and
rattled
the
fragrant
steam
ascended
and
soon
this
little
circlet
in
the
wilderness
grew
warm
and
genial
as
my
lady
s
and
after
this
there
came
the
comforter
of
those
that
are
hungry
and
wayworn
and
it
has
this
helps
to
destroy
the
and
awkwardness
which
one
sometimes
feels
at
being
in
company
with
one
s
dependants
for
whilst
the
amber
is
at
your
lips
there
is
nothing
ungracious
in
your
remaining
silent
or
speaking
pithily
in
short
sentences
and
for
us
that
night
there
was
pleasant
and
plentiful
matter
of
talk
for
the
where
we
should
be
on
the
morrow
and
the
wherewithal
we
should
be
fed
whether
by
some
ford
we
should
regain
the
western
bank
of
jordan
or
find
bread
and
salt
under
the
tents
of
a
wandering
tribe
or
whether
we
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
so
come
to
see
last
and
greatest
of
all
the
fine
sights
that
there
were
questionings
not
dull
nor
wearisome
to
us
for
we
were
all
concerned
in
the
answers
and
it
was
not
an
morrow
that
we
probed
with
our
sharp
guesses
for
the
lights
of
those
low
philistines
the
men
of
the
caves
still
hung
over
our
heads
and
we
knew
by
their
yells
that
the
fire
of
our
bivouac
had
shown
us
at
length
we
thought
it
well
to
seek
for
sleep
our
plans
were
laid
for
keeping
up
a
good
watch
through
the
night
my
quilt
and
my
pelisse
and
my
cloak
were
spread
out
so
that
i
might
lie
spokewise
with
my
feet
towards
the
central
fire
i
wrapped
my
limbs
daintily
round
and
gave
myself
positive
orders
to
sleep
like
a
veteran
soldier
but
i
found
that
my
attempt
to
sleep
upon
the
earth
that
god
gave
me
was
more
new
and
strange
than
i
had
fancied
it
i
had
grown
used
to
the
scene
which
was
before
me
whilst
i
was
sitting
or
reclining
by
the
side
of
the
fire
but
now
that
i
laid
myself
down
at
length
it
was
the
deep
black
mystery
of
the
heavens
that
hung
over
my
an
earthly
thing
in
the
way
from
my
own
very
forehead
right
up
to
the
end
of
all
space
i
grew
proud
of
my
boundless
bedchamber
i
might
have
found
sermons
in
all
this
greatness
if
i
had
i
should
surely
have
slept
but
such
was
not
then
my
way
if
this
cherished
self
of
mine
had
built
the
universe
i
should
have
dwelt
with
delight
on
the
wonders
of
as
it
was
i
felt
rather
the
of
my
promotion
from
out
of
mere
rooms
and
houses
into
the
midst
of
that
grand
dark
infinite
palace
and
then
too
my
head
far
from
the
fire
was
in
cold
latitudes
and
it
seemed
to
me
strange
that
i
should
be
lying
so
still
and
passive
whilst
the
sharp
night
breeze
walked
free
over
my
cheek
and
the
cold
damp
clung
to
my
hair
as
though
my
face
grew
in
the
earth
and
must
bear
with
the
footsteps
of
the
wind
and
the
falling
of
the
dew
as
meekly
as
the
grass
of
the
field
besides
i
got
puzzled
and
distracted
by
having
to
endure
heat
and
cold
at
the
same
time
for
i
was
always
considering
whether
my
feet
were
not
and
whether
my
face
was
not
too
well
iced
and
so
when
from
time
to
time
the
watch
quietly
and
gently
kept
up
the
languishing
fire
he
seldom
i
think
was
unseen
to
my
restless
eyes
yet
at
last
when
they
called
me
and
said
that
the
morn
would
soon
be
dawning
i
rose
from
a
state
of
not
much
unlike
to
sleep
though
sharply
qualified
by
a
sort
of
vegetable
s
consciousness
of
having
been
growing
still
colder
and
colder
for
many
and
many
an
hour
chapter
xiii
the
dead
sea
the
grey
light
of
the
morning
showed
us
for
the
first
time
the
ground
which
we
had
chosen
for
our
we
found
that
we
had
bivouacked
upon
a
little
patch
of
barley
plainly
belonging
to
the
men
of
the
caves
the
dead
bushes
which
we
found
so
happily
placed
in
readiness
for
our
fire
had
been
strewn
as
a
fence
for
the
protection
of
the
little
crop
this
was
the
only
cultivated
spot
of
ground
which
we
had
seen
for
many
a
league
and
i
was
rather
sorry
to
find
that
our
night
fire
and
our
cattle
had
spread
so
much
ruin
upon
this
poor
solitary
slip
of
the
saddling
and
loading
of
our
beasts
was
a
work
which
generally
took
nearly
an
hour
and
before
this
was
half
over
daylight
came
we
could
now
see
the
men
of
the
caves
they
collected
in
a
body
amounting
i
should
think
to
nearly
fifty
and
rushed
down
towards
our
quarters
with
fierce
shouts
and
yells
but
the
nearer
they
got
the
slower
they
went
their
shouts
grew
less
resolute
in
tone
and
soon
ceased
altogether
the
fellows
however
advanced
to
a
thicket
within
thirty
yards
of
us
and
behind
this
took
up
their
my
men
without
premeditation
did
exactly
that
which
was
best
they
kept
steadily
to
their
work
of
loading
the
beasts
without
fuss
or
hurry
and
whether
it
was
that
they
instinctively
felt
the
wisdom
of
keeping
quiet
or
that
they
merely
obeyed
the
natural
inclination
to
silence
which
one
feels
in
the
early
morning
i
can
not
tell
but
i
know
that
except
when
they
exchanged
a
syllable
or
two
relative
to
the
work
they
were
about
not
a
word
was
said
i
now
believe
that
this
quietness
of
our
party
created
an
undefined
terror
in
the
minds
of
the
and
scared
them
from
coming
on
it
gave
them
a
notion
that
we
were
relying
on
some
resources
which
they
knew
not
of
several
times
the
fellows
tried
to
lash
themselves
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
might
do
instead
of
pluck
they
would
raise
a
great
shout
and
sway
forward
in
a
dense
body
from
behind
the
thicket
but
when
they
saw
that
their
bravery
thus
gathered
to
a
head
did
not
even
suspend
the
strapping
of
a
portmanteau
or
the
tying
of
a
hatbox
their
shout
lost
its
spirit
and
the
whole
mass
was
irresistibly
drawn
back
like
a
wave
receding
from
the
shore
these
attempts
at
an
onset
were
repeated
several
times
but
always
with
the
same
result
i
remained
under
the
apprehension
of
an
attack
for
more
than
half
an
hour
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
work
of
packing
and
loading
had
never
been
done
so
slowly
i
felt
inclined
to
tell
my
fellows
to
make
their
best
speed
but
just
as
i
was
going
to
speak
i
observed
that
every
one
was
doing
his
duty
already
i
therefore
held
my
peace
and
said
not
a
word
till
at
last
mysseri
led
up
my
horse
and
asked
me
if
i
were
ready
to
mount
we
all
marched
off
without
hindrance
after
some
time
we
came
across
a
party
of
ibrahim
s
cavalry
which
had
bivouacked
at
no
great
distance
from
us
the
knowledge
that
such
a
force
was
in
the
neighbourhood
may
have
conduced
to
the
forbearance
of
the
we
saw
a
fellow
nearly
black
and
wearing
nothing
but
a
cloth
round
the
loins
he
was
tending
flocks
afterwards
i
came
up
with
another
of
these
goatherds
whose
helpmate
was
with
him
they
gave
us
some
goat
s
milk
a
welcome
present
i
pitied
the
poor
devil
of
a
for
having
such
a
very
plain
wife
i
spend
an
enormous
quantity
of
pity
upon
that
particular
form
of
human
misery
about
midday
i
began
to
examine
my
map
and
to
question
my
guide
who
at
last
fell
on
his
knees
and
confessed
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
country
in
which
we
were
i
was
thus
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
and
calculating
that
on
the
preceding
day
we
had
nearly
performed
a
two
days
journey
i
concluded
that
the
dead
sea
must
be
near
in
this
i
was
right
for
at
about
three
or
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
caught
a
first
sight
of
its
dismal
face
i
went
on
and
came
near
to
those
waters
of
death
they
stretched
deeply
into
the
southern
desert
and
before
me
and
all
around
as
far
away
as
the
eye
could
follow
blank
hills
piled
high
over
hills
pale
yellow
and
naked
walled
up
in
her
tomb
for
ever
the
dead
and
damned
gomorrah
there
was
no
fly
that
hummed
in
the
forbidden
air
but
instead
a
deep
stillness
no
grass
grew
from
the
earth
no
weed
peered
through
the
void
sand
but
in
mockery
of
all
life
there
were
trees
borne
down
by
jordan
in
some
ancient
flood
and
these
grotesquely
planted
upon
the
forlorn
shore
spread
out
their
grim
skeleton
arms
all
scorched
and
charred
to
blackness
by
the
heats
of
the
long
silent
years
i
now
struck
off
towards
the
débouchure
of
the
river
but
i
found
that
the
country
though
seemingly
quite
flat
was
intersected
by
deep
ravines
which
did
not
show
themselves
until
nearly
approached
for
some
time
my
progress
was
much
obstructed
but
at
last
i
came
across
a
track
which
led
towards
the
river
and
which
might
as
i
hoped
bring
me
to
a
ford
i
found
in
fact
when
i
came
to
the
river
s
side
that
the
track
reappeared
upon
the
opposite
bank
plainly
showing
that
the
stream
had
been
fordable
at
this
place
now
however
in
consequence
of
the
late
rains
the
river
was
quite
impracticable
for
a
body
of
waters
about
equal
to
the
thames
at
eton
but
confined
to
a
narrower
channel
poured
down
in
a
current
so
swift
and
heavy
that
the
idea
of
passing
with
laden
was
utterly
forbidden
i
could
have
swum
across
myself
and
i
might
perhaps
have
succeeded
in
swimming
a
horse
over
but
this
would
have
been
useless
because
in
such
case
i
must
have
abandoned
not
only
my
baggage
but
all
my
attendants
for
none
of
them
were
able
to
swim
and
without
that
resource
it
would
have
been
madness
for
them
to
rely
upon
the
swimming
of
their
beasts
across
such
a
powerful
stream
i
still
hoped
however
that
there
might
be
a
chance
of
passing
the
river
at
the
point
of
its
actual
junction
with
the
dead
sea
and
i
therefore
went
on
in
that
direction
night
came
upon
us
whilst
labouring
across
gullies
and
sandy
mounds
and
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
a
standstill
quite
suddenly
upon
the
very
edge
of
a
precipitous
descent
every
step
towards
the
dead
sea
had
brought
us
into
a
country
more
and
more
dreary
and
this
sandhill
which
we
were
forced
to
choose
for
our
was
dismal
enough
a
few
slender
blades
of
grass
which
here
and
there
singly
pierced
the
sand
mocked
bitterly
the
hunger
of
our
jaded
beasts
and
with
our
small
remaining
fragment
of
goat
rock
by
way
of
supper
we
were
not
much
better
off
than
our
horses
we
wanted
too
the
great
requisite
of
a
cheery
moreover
the
spot
on
which
we
had
been
so
suddenly
brought
to
a
standstill
was
relatively
high
and
unsheltered
and
the
night
wind
blew
swiftly
and
cold
the
next
morning
i
reached
the
débouchure
of
the
jordan
where
i
had
hoped
to
find
a
bar
of
sand
that
might
render
its
passage
possible
the
river
however
rolled
its
eddying
waters
fast
down
to
the
sea
in
a
strong
deep
stream
that
shut
out
all
hope
of
crossing
it
now
seemed
necessary
either
to
construct
a
raft
of
some
kind
or
else
to
retrace
my
steps
and
remount
the
banks
of
the
jordan
i
had
once
happened
to
give
some
attention
to
the
subject
of
military
branch
of
military
science
which
includes
the
construction
of
rafts
and
contrivances
of
the
like
i
should
have
been
very
proud
indeed
if
i
could
have
carried
my
party
and
my
baggage
across
by
dint
of
any
idea
gathered
from
sir
howard
douglas
or
robinson
crusoe
but
we
were
all
faint
and
languid
from
want
of
food
and
besides
there
were
no
materials
higher
up
the
river
there
were
bushes
and
river
plants
but
nothing
like
timber
and
the
cord
with
which
my
baggage
was
tied
to
the
amounted
altogether
to
a
very
small
quantity
not
nearly
enough
to
haul
any
sort
of
craft
across
the
stream
and
now
it
was
if
i
remember
rightly
that
dthemetri
submitted
to
me
a
plan
for
putting
to
death
the
nazarene
whose
misguidance
had
been
the
cause
of
our
difficulties
there
was
something
fascinating
in
this
suggestion
for
the
slaying
of
the
guide
was
of
course
easy
enough
and
would
look
like
an
act
of
what
politicians
call
if
it
were
only
to
become
known
to
my
friends
in
england
that
i
had
calmly
killed
a
for
taking
me
out
of
my
way
i
might
remain
perfectly
quiet
and
tranquil
for
all
the
rest
of
my
days
quite
free
from
the
danger
of
being
considered
slow
i
might
ever
after
live
on
upon
my
reputation
like
hamilton
in
the
last
century
or
single
in
this
without
being
obliged
to
take
the
trouble
of
doing
any
more
harm
in
the
world
this
was
a
great
temptation
to
an
indolent
person
but
the
motive
was
not
strengthened
by
any
sincere
feeling
of
anger
with
the
nazarene
whilst
the
question
of
his
life
and
death
was
debated
he
was
riding
in
front
of
our
party
and
there
was
something
in
the
anxious
writhing
of
his
supple
limbs
that
seemed
to
express
a
sense
of
his
false
position
and
struck
me
as
highly
comic
i
had
no
crotchet
at
that
time
against
the
punishment
of
death
but
i
was
unused
to
blood
and
the
proposed
victim
looked
so
thoroughly
capable
of
enjoying
life
if
he
could
only
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
that
i
thought
it
would
be
hard
for
him
to
die
merely
in
order
to
give
me
a
character
for
energy
acting
on
the
result
of
these
considerations
and
reserving
to
myself
a
free
and
unfettered
discretion
to
have
the
poor
villain
shot
at
any
future
moment
i
magnanimously
decided
that
for
the
present
he
should
live
and
not
die
i
bathed
in
the
dead
sea
the
ground
covered
by
the
water
sloped
so
gradually
that
i
was
not
only
forced
to
sneak
in
but
to
walk
through
the
water
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
i
could
get
out
of
my
depth
when
at
last
i
was
able
to
attempt
to
dive
the
salts
held
in
solution
made
my
eyes
smart
so
sharply
that
the
pain
which
i
thus
suffered
together
with
the
weakness
occasioned
by
want
of
food
made
me
giddy
and
faint
for
some
moments
but
i
soon
grew
better
i
knew
beforehand
the
impossibility
of
sinking
in
this
buoyant
water
but
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
could
not
swim
at
my
accustomed
pace
my
legs
and
feet
were
lifted
so
high
and
dry
out
of
the
lake
that
my
stroke
was
baffled
and
i
found
myself
kicking
against
the
thin
air
instead
of
the
dense
fluid
upon
which
i
was
swimming
the
water
is
perfectly
bright
and
clear
its
taste
detestable
after
finishing
my
attempts
at
swimming
and
diving
i
took
some
time
in
regaining
the
shore
and
before
i
began
to
dress
i
found
that
the
sun
had
already
evaporated
the
water
which
clung
to
me
and
that
my
skin
was
thickly
encrusted
with
salts
chapter
xiv
the
black
tents
my
steps
were
reluctantly
turned
towards
the
north
i
had
ridden
some
way
and
still
it
seemed
that
all
life
was
fenced
and
barred
out
from
the
desolate
ground
over
which
i
was
journeying
on
the
west
there
flowed
the
impassable
jordan
on
the
east
stood
an
endless
range
of
barren
mountains
and
on
the
south
lay
that
desert
sea
that
knew
not
the
plashing
of
an
oar
greatly
therefore
was
i
surprised
when
suddenly
there
broke
upon
my
ear
the
long
ludicrous
persevering
bray
of
a
donkey
i
was
riding
at
this
time
some
few
hundred
yards
ahead
of
all
my
party
except
the
nazarene
who
by
a
wise
instinct
kept
closer
to
me
than
to
dthemetri
and
i
instantly
went
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
for
i
fancied
that
where
there
were
donkeys
there
too
most
surely
would
be
men
the
ground
on
all
sides
of
me
seemed
thoroughly
void
and
lifeless
but
at
last
i
got
down
into
a
hollow
and
presently
a
sudden
turn
brought
me
within
thirty
yards
of
an
arab
encampment
the
low
black
tents
which
i
had
so
long
lusted
to
see
were
right
before
me
and
they
were
all
teeming
with
live
women
and
children
i
wished
to
have
let
my
party
behind
know
where
i
was
but
i
recollected
that
they
would
be
able
to
trace
me
by
the
prints
of
my
horse
s
hoofs
in
the
sand
and
having
to
do
with
asiatics
i
felt
the
danger
of
the
slightest
movement
which
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
sign
of
irresolution
therefore
without
looking
behind
me
without
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
i
rode
straight
up
towards
the
foremost
tent
before
this
was
strewed
a
fence
of
dead
boughs
through
which
there
was
an
opening
opposite
to
the
front
of
the
tent
as
i
advanced
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
most
fellows
imaginable
came
forward
to
meet
me
in
their
appearance
they
showed
nothing
of
the
bedouin
blood
they
were
of
many
colours
from
dingy
brown
to
jet
black
and
some
of
these
last
had
much
of
the
negro
look
about
them
they
were
tall
powerful
fellows
but
awfully
ugly
they
wore
nothing
but
the
arab
shirts
confined
at
the
waist
by
leathern
belts
i
advanced
to
the
gap
left
in
the
fence
and
at
once
alighted
from
my
horse
the
chief
greeted
me
after
his
fashion
by
alternately
touching
first
my
hand
and
then
his
own
forehead
as
if
he
were
conveying
the
virtue
of
the
touch
like
a
spark
of
electricity
presently
i
found
myself
seated
upon
a
sheepskin
which
was
spread
for
me
under
the
sacred
shade
of
arabian
canvas
the
tent
was
of
a
long
narrow
oblong
form
and
contained
a
quantity
of
men
women
and
children
so
closely
huddled
together
that
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
who
was
not
in
actual
contact
with
his
neighbour
the
moment
i
had
taken
my
seat
the
chief
repeated
his
salutations
in
the
most
enthusiastic
manner
and
then
the
people
having
gathered
densely
about
me
got
hold
of
my
unresisting
hand
and
passed
it
round
like
a
claret
jug
for
the
benefit
of
everybody
the
women
soon
brought
me
a
wooden
bowl
full
of
buttermilk
and
welcome
indeed
came
the
gift
to
my
hungry
and
thirsty
soul
after
some
time
my
party
as
i
had
expected
came
up
and
when
poor
dthemetri
saw
me
on
my
sheepskin
the
life
and
soul
of
this
ragamuffin
party
he
was
so
astounded
that
he
even
failed
to
check
his
cry
of
horror
he
plainly
thought
that
now
at
last
the
lord
had
delivered
me
interpreter
and
all
into
the
hands
of
the
lowest
philistines
mysseri
carried
a
slung
at
his
belt
and
as
soon
as
its
contents
were
known
the
whole
population
of
the
tent
began
begging
like
spaniels
for
bits
of
the
beloved
weed
i
concluded
from
the
abject
manner
of
these
people
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
thoroughbred
bedouins
and
i
saw
too
that
they
must
be
in
the
very
last
stage
of
misery
for
poor
indeed
is
the
man
in
these
climes
who
can
not
command
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
i
began
to
think
that
i
had
fallen
amongst
thorough
savages
and
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
they
would
gain
their
very
first
knowledge
of
civilisation
by
ravishing
and
studying
the
contents
of
my
dearest
portmanteaus
but
still
my
impression
was
that
they
would
hardly
venture
upon
such
an
attempt
i
observed
indeed
that
they
did
not
offer
me
the
bread
and
salt
which
i
had
understood
to
be
the
pledges
of
peace
amongst
wandering
tribes
but
i
fancied
that
they
refrained
from
this
act
of
hospitality
not
in
consequence
of
any
hostile
determination
but
in
order
that
the
notion
of
robbing
me
might
remain
for
the
present
an
open
i
afterwards
found
that
the
poor
fellows
had
no
bread
to
offer
they
were
literally
out
at
it
is
true
that
they
had
a
scanty
supply
of
milk
from
goats
but
they
were
living
almost
entirely
upon
certain
grass
stems
which
were
just
in
season
at
that
time
of
the
year
these
if
not
highly
nourishing
are
pleasant
enough
to
the
taste
and
their
acid
juices
come
gratefully
to
thirsty
lips
chapter
xv
passage
of
the
jordan
and
now
dthemetri
began
to
enter
into
a
negotiation
with
my
hosts
for
a
passage
over
the
river
i
never
interfered
with
my
worthy
dragoman
upon
these
occasions
because
from
my
entire
ignorance
of
the
arabic
i
should
have
been
quite
unable
to
exercise
any
real
control
over
his
words
and
it
would
have
been
silly
to
break
the
stream
of
his
eloquence
to
no
purpose
i
have
reason
to
fear
however
that
he
lied
transcendently
and
especially
in
representing
me
as
the
bosom
friend
of
ibrahim
pasha
the
mention
of
that
name
produced
immense
agitation
and
excitement
and
the
sheik
explained
to
dthemetri
the
grounds
of
the
infinite
respect
which
he
and
his
tribe
entertained
for
the
pasha
a
few
weeks
before
ibrahim
had
craftily
sent
a
body
of
troops
across
the
jordan
the
force
went
warily
round
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
on
the
east
so
as
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
this
tribe
and
then
surrounded
them
as
they
lay
encamped
in
the
vale
their
camels
and
indeed
all
their
possessions
worth
taking
were
carried
off
by
the
soldiery
and
moreover
the
then
sheik
together
with
every
tenth
man
of
the
tribe
was
brought
out
and
shot
you
would
think
that
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
pasha
might
not
procure
for
his
friend
a
very
gracious
reception
amongst
the
people
whom
he
had
thus
despoiled
and
decimated
but
the
asiatic
seems
to
be
animated
with
a
feeling
of
profound
respect
almost
bordering
upon
affection
for
all
who
have
done
him
any
bold
and
violent
wrong
and
there
is
always
too
so
much
of
vague
and
undefined
apprehension
mixed
up
with
his
really
alarms
that
i
can
see
no
limit
to
the
yielding
and
bending
of
his
mind
when
it
is
wrought
upon
by
the
idea
of
power
after
some
discussion
the
arabs
agreed
as
i
thought
to
conduct
me
to
a
ford
and
we
moved
on
towards
the
river
followed
by
seventeen
of
the
most
of
the
tribe
under
the
guidance
of
several
elders
and
sheik
ali
djoubran
at
the
head
of
the
whole
detachment
upon
leaving
the
encampment
a
sort
of
ceremony
was
performed
for
the
purpose
it
seemed
of
ensuring
if
possible
a
happy
result
for
the
undertaking
there
was
an
uplifting
of
arms
and
a
repeating
of
words
that
sounded
like
formulæ
but
there
were
no
prostrations
and
i
did
not
understand
that
the
ceremony
was
of
a
religious
character
the
tented
arabs
are
looked
upon
as
very
bad
mahometans
we
arrived
upon
the
banks
of
the
at
a
ford
but
at
a
deep
and
rapid
part
of
the
stream
and
i
now
understood
that
it
was
the
plan
of
these
men
if
they
helped
me
at
all
to
transport
me
across
the
river
by
some
species
of
raft
but
a
reaction
had
taken
place
in
the
opinions
of
many
and
a
violent
dispute
arose
upon
a
motion
which
seemed
to
have
been
made
by
some
honourable
member
with
a
view
to
robbery
the
fellows
all
gathered
together
in
circle
at
a
little
distance
from
my
party
and
there
disputed
with
great
vehemence
and
fury
for
nearly
two
hours
i
can
t
give
a
correct
report
of
the
debate
for
it
was
held
in
a
barbarous
dialect
of
the
arabic
unknown
to
my
dragoman
i
recollect
i
sincerely
felt
at
the
time
that
the
arguments
in
favour
of
robbing
me
must
have
been
almost
unanswerable
and
i
gave
great
credit
to
the
speakers
on
my
side
for
the
ingenuity
and
sophistry
which
they
must
have
shown
in
maintaining
the
fight
so
well
during
the
discussion
i
remained
lying
in
front
of
my
baggage
which
had
all
been
taken
from
the
and
placed
upon
the
ground
i
was
so
languid
from
want
of
food
that
i
had
scarcely
animation
enough
to
feel
as
deeply
interested
as
you
would
suppose
in
the
result
of
the
discussion
i
thought
however
that
the
pleasantest
toys
to
play
with
during
this
interval
were
my
pistols
and
now
and
then
when
i
listlessly
visited
my
loaded
barrels
with
the
swivel
ramrods
or
drew
a
sweet
musical
click
from
my
english
firelocks
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
exercised
a
slight
and
gentle
influence
on
the
debate
thanks
to
ibrahim
pasha
s
terrible
visitation
the
men
of
the
tribe
were
wholly
unarmed
and
my
advantage
in
this
respect
might
have
counterbalanced
in
some
measure
the
superiority
of
numbers
mysseri
not
interpreting
in
arabic
had
no
duty
to
perform
and
he
seemed
to
be
faint
and
listless
as
myself
shereef
looked
perfectly
resigned
to
any
fate
but
dthemetri
faithful
terrier
was
bristling
with
zeal
and
watchfulness
he
could
not
understand
the
debate
which
indeed
was
carried
on
at
a
distance
too
great
to
be
easily
heard
even
if
the
language
had
been
familiar
but
he
was
always
on
the
alert
and
now
and
then
conferring
with
men
who
had
straggled
out
of
the
assembly
at
last
he
found
an
opportunity
of
making
a
proposal
which
at
once
produced
immense
sensation
he
offered
on
my
behalf
that
if
the
tribe
should
bear
themselves
loyally
towards
me
and
take
my
party
and
my
baggage
in
safety
to
the
other
bank
of
the
river
i
should
give
them
a
or
written
certificate
of
their
good
conduct
which
might
avail
them
hereafter
in
the
hour
of
their
direst
need
this
proposal
was
received
and
instantly
accepted
by
all
the
men
of
the
tribe
there
present
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
i
was
to
give
the
men
too
a
that
is
a
present
of
money
which
is
usually
made
upon
the
conclusion
of
any
sort
of
treaty
but
although
the
people
of
the
tribe
were
so
miserably
poor
they
seemed
to
look
upon
the
pecuniary
part
of
the
arrangement
as
a
matter
quite
trivial
in
comparison
with
the
indeed
the
sum
which
dthemetri
promised
them
was
extremely
small
and
not
the
slightest
attempt
was
made
to
extort
any
further
reward
the
council
now
broke
up
and
most
of
the
men
rushed
madly
towards
me
and
overwhelmed
me
with
vehement
gratulations
they
caressed
my
boots
with
much
affection
and
my
hands
were
severely
kissed
the
arabs
now
went
to
work
in
right
earnest
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
river
they
had
brought
with
them
a
great
number
of
the
skins
which
they
use
for
carrying
water
in
the
desert
these
they
filled
with
air
and
fastened
several
of
them
to
small
boughs
which
they
cut
from
the
banks
of
the
river
in
this
way
they
constructed
a
raft
not
more
than
about
four
or
five
feet
square
but
rendered
buoyant
by
the
inflated
skins
which
supported
it
on
this
a
portion
of
my
baggage
was
placed
and
was
firmly
tied
to
it
by
the
cords
used
on
my
the
little
raft
with
its
weighty
cargo
was
then
gently
lifted
into
the
water
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
that
it
floated
well
twelve
of
the
arabs
now
stripped
and
tied
inflated
skins
to
their
loins
six
of
the
men
went
down
into
the
river
got
in
front
of
the
little
raft
and
pulled
it
off
a
few
feet
from
the
bank
the
other
six
then
dashed
into
the
stream
with
loud
shouts
and
swam
along
after
the
raft
pushing
it
from
behind
off
went
the
craft
in
capital
style
at
first
for
the
stream
was
easy
on
the
eastern
side
but
i
saw
that
the
tug
was
to
come
for
the
main
torrent
swept
round
in
a
bend
near
the
western
bank
of
the
river
the
old
men
with
their
long
grey
grisly
beards
stood
shouting
and
cheering
praying
and
commanding
at
length
the
raft
entered
upon
the
difficult
part
of
its
course
the
whirling
stream
seized
and
twisted
it
about
and
then
bore
it
rapidly
downwards
the
swimmers
flagged
and
seemed
to
be
beaten
in
the
struggle
but
now
the
old
men
on
the
bank
with
their
rigid
arms
uplifted
straight
sent
forth
a
cry
and
a
shout
that
tore
the
wide
air
into
tatters
and
then
to
make
their
urging
yet
more
strong
they
shrieked
out
the
dreadful
syllables
brahim
pasha
the
swimmers
one
moment
before
so
blown
and
so
weary
found
lungs
to
answer
the
cry
and
shouting
back
the
name
of
their
great
destroyer
they
dashed
on
through
the
torrent
and
bore
the
raft
in
safety
to
the
western
bank
afterwards
the
swimmers
returned
with
the
raft
and
attached
to
it
the
rest
of
my
baggage
i
took
my
seat
upon
the
top
of
the
cargo
and
the
raft
thus
laden
passed
the
river
in
the
same
way
and
with
the
same
struggle
as
before
the
skins
however
not
being
perfectly
had
lost
a
great
part
of
their
buoyancy
so
that
i
as
well
as
the
luggage
that
passed
on
this
last
voyage
got
wet
in
the
waters
of
jordan
the
raft
could
not
be
trusted
for
another
trip
and
the
rest
of
my
party
passed
the
river
in
a
different
and
for
them
much
safer
way
inflated
skins
were
fastened
to
their
loins
and
thus
supported
they
were
tugged
across
by
arabs
swimming
on
either
side
of
them
the
horses
and
mules
were
thrown
into
the
water
and
forced
to
swim
over
the
poor
beasts
had
a
hard
struggle
for
their
lives
in
that
swift
stream
and
i
thought
that
one
of
the
horses
would
have
been
drowned
for
he
was
too
weak
to
gain
a
footing
on
the
western
bank
and
the
stream
bore
him
down
at
last
however
he
swam
back
to
the
side
from
which
he
had
come
before
dark
all
had
passed
the
river
except
this
one
horse
and
old
shereef
he
poor
fellow
was
shivering
on
the
eastern
bank
for
his
dread
of
the
passage
was
so
great
that
he
delayed
it
as
long
as
he
could
and
at
last
it
became
so
dark
that
he
was
obliged
to
wait
till
the
morning
i
lay
that
night
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
at
a
little
distance
from
me
the
arabs
kindled
a
fire
round
which
they
sat
in
a
circle
they
were
made
most
savagely
happy
by
the
tobacco
with
which
i
supplied
them
and
they
soon
determined
that
the
whole
night
should
be
one
smoking
festival
the
poor
fellows
had
only
a
cracked
bowl
without
any
tube
at
all
but
this
morsel
of
a
pipe
they
handed
round
from
one
to
the
other
allowing
to
each
a
fixed
number
of
whiffs
in
that
way
they
passed
the
whole
night
the
next
morning
old
shereef
was
brought
across
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
see
this
solemn
old
mussulman
with
his
shaven
head
and
his
sacred
beard
sprawling
and
puffing
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
when
at
last
he
reached
the
bank
the
people
told
him
that
by
his
baptism
in
jordan
he
had
surely
become
a
mere
christian
poor
shereef
holy
man
the
descendant
of
the
prophet
was
sadly
hurt
by
the
taunt
and
the
more
so
as
he
seemed
to
feel
that
there
was
some
foundation
for
it
and
that
he
really
might
have
absorbed
some
christian
errors
when
all
was
ready
for
departure
i
wrote
the
in
french
and
delivered
it
to
sheik
ali
djoubran
together
with
the
promised
he
was
exceedingly
grateful
and
i
parted
in
a
very
friendly
way
from
this
ragged
tribe
in
two
or
three
hours
i
gained
rihah
a
village
said
to
occupy
the
site
of
ancient
jericho
there
was
one
building
there
which
i
observed
with
some
emotion
for
although
it
may
not
have
been
actually
standing
in
the
days
of
jericho
it
contained
at
this
day
a
most
interesting
collection
loaves
some
hours
after
sunset
i
reached
the
convent
of
santo
saba
and
there
remained
for
the
night
chapter
xvi
terra
santa
the
enthusiasm
that
had
glowed
or
seemed
to
glow
within
me
for
one
blessed
moment
when
i
knelt
by
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
at
nazareth
was
not
rekindled
at
jerusalem
in
the
stead
of
the
solemn
gloom
and
the
deep
stillness
that
of
right
belonged
to
the
holy
city
there
was
the
hum
and
the
bustle
of
active
life
it
was
the
height
of
the
the
easter
ceremonies
drew
near
the
pilgrims
were
flocking
in
from
all
quarters
and
although
their
objects
were
partly
at
least
of
a
religious
character
yet
their
arrivals
brought
as
much
stir
and
liveliness
to
the
city
as
if
they
had
come
up
to
marry
their
daughters
the
votaries
who
every
year
crowd
to
the
holy
sepulchre
are
chiefly
of
the
greek
and
armenian
churches
they
are
not
drawn
into
palestine
by
a
mere
sentimental
longing
to
stand
upon
the
ground
trodden
by
our
saviour
but
rather
they
perform
the
pilgrimage
as
a
plain
duty
strongly
inculcated
by
their
religion
a
very
great
proportion
of
those
who
belong
to
the
greek
church
contrive
at
some
time
or
other
in
the
course
of
their
lives
to
achieve
the
enterprise
many
in
their
infancy
and
childhood
are
brought
to
the
holy
sites
by
their
parents
but
those
who
have
not
had
this
advantage
will
often
make
it
the
main
object
of
their
lives
to
save
money
enough
for
this
holy
undertaking
the
pilgrims
begin
to
arrive
in
palestine
some
weeks
before
the
easter
festival
of
the
greek
church
they
come
from
egypt
from
all
parts
of
syria
from
armenia
and
asia
minor
from
stamboul
from
roumelia
from
the
provinces
of
the
danube
and
from
all
the
russias
most
of
these
people
bring
with
them
some
articles
of
merchandise
but
i
myself
believe
notwithstanding
the
common
taunt
against
pilgrims
that
they
do
this
rather
as
a
mode
of
paying
the
expenses
of
their
journey
than
from
a
spirit
of
mercenary
speculation
they
generally
travel
in
families
for
the
women
are
of
course
more
ardent
than
their
husbands
in
undertaking
these
pious
enterprises
and
they
take
care
to
bring
with
them
all
their
children
however
young
for
the
efficacy
of
the
rites
does
not
depend
upon
the
age
of
the
votary
so
that
people
whose
careful
mothers
have
obtained
for
them
the
benefit
of
the
pilgrimage
in
early
life
are
saved
from
the
expense
and
trouble
of
undertaking
the
journey
at
a
later
age
the
superior
veneration
so
often
excited
by
objects
that
are
distant
and
unknown
shows
not
perhaps
the
wrongheadedness
of
a
man
but
rather
the
transcendent
power
of
his
imagination
however
this
may
be
and
whether
it
is
by
mere
obstinacy
that
they
poke
their
way
through
intervening
distance
or
whether
they
come
by
the
winged
strength
of
fancy
quite
certainly
the
pilgrims
who
flock
to
palestine
from
the
most
remote
homes
are
the
people
most
eager
in
the
enterprise
and
in
number
too
they
bear
a
very
high
proportion
to
the
whole
mass
the
great
bulk
of
the
pilgrims
make
their
way
by
sea
to
the
port
of
jaffa
a
number
of
families
charter
a
vessel
amongst
them
all
bringing
their
own
provisions
which
are
of
the
simplest
and
cheapest
kind
on
board
every
vessel
thus
freighted
there
is
i
believe
a
priest
who
helps
the
people
in
their
religious
exercises
and
tries
and
fails
to
maintain
something
like
order
and
harmony
the
vessels
employed
in
this
service
are
usually
greek
brigs
or
brigantines
and
schooners
and
the
number
of
passengers
stowed
in
them
is
almost
always
horribly
excessive
the
voyages
are
sadly
protracted
not
only
by
the
habits
of
the
greek
seamen
but
also
by
their
endless
schemes
and
speculations
which
are
for
ever
tempting
them
to
touch
at
the
nearest
port
the
voyage
too
must
be
made
in
winter
in
order
that
jerusalem
may
be
reached
some
weeks
before
the
greek
easter
and
thus
by
the
time
they
attain
to
the
holy
shrines
the
pilgrims
have
really
and
truly
undergone
a
very
respectable
quantity
of
suffering
i
once
saw
one
of
these
pious
cargoes
put
ashore
on
the
coast
of
cyprus
where
they
had
touched
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
not
paphos
but
some
christian
sanctuary
i
never
saw
no
never
even
in
the
most
horridly
stuffy
ballroom
such
a
discomfortable
collection
of
human
beings
long
huddled
together
in
a
pitching
and
rolling
prison
fed
on
beans
exposed
to
some
real
danger
and
to
terrors
without
end
they
had
been
tumbled
about
for
many
wintry
weeks
in
the
chopping
seas
of
the
mediterranean
as
soon
as
they
landed
they
stood
upon
the
beach
and
chanted
a
hymn
of
thanks
the
chant
was
morne
and
doleful
but
really
the
poor
people
were
looking
so
miserable
that
one
could
not
fairly
expect
from
them
any
lively
outpouring
of
gratitude
when
the
pilgrims
have
landed
at
jaffa
they
hire
camels
horses
mules
or
donkeys
and
make
their
way
as
well
as
they
can
to
the
holy
city
the
space
fronting
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
soon
becomes
a
kind
of
bazaar
or
rather
perhaps
reminds
you
of
an
english
fair
on
this
spot
the
pilgrims
display
their
merchandise
and
there
too
the
trading
residents
of
the
place
offer
their
goods
for
sale
i
have
never
i
think
seen
elsewhere
in
asia
so
much
commercial
animation
as
upon
this
square
of
ground
by
the
church
door
the
seemed
to
be
almost
as
brisk
and
lively
as
if
they
had
been
the
temple
when
i
entered
the
church
i
found
a
babel
of
worshippers
greek
roman
and
armenian
priests
were
performing
their
different
rites
in
various
nooks
and
corners
and
crowds
of
disciples
were
rushing
about
in
all
directions
some
laughing
and
talking
some
begging
but
most
of
them
going
round
in
a
regular
and
methodical
way
to
kiss
the
sanctified
spots
and
speak
the
appointed
syllables
and
lay
down
the
accustomed
coin
if
this
kissing
of
the
shrines
had
seemed
as
though
it
were
done
at
the
bidding
of
enthusiasm
or
of
any
poor
sentiment
even
feebly
approaching
to
it
the
sight
would
have
been
less
odd
to
english
eyes
but
as
it
was
i
stared
to
see
grown
men
thus
steadily
and
carefully
embracing
the
sticks
and
the
stones
not
from
love
or
from
zeal
else
god
forbid
that
i
should
have
stared
but
from
a
calm
sense
of
duty
they
seemed
to
be
not
working
out
but
the
great
business
of
salvation
dthemetri
however
who
generally
came
with
me
when
i
went
out
in
order
to
do
duty
as
interpreter
really
had
in
him
some
enthusiasm
he
was
a
zealous
and
almost
fanatical
member
of
the
greek
church
and
had
long
since
performed
the
pilgrimage
so
now
great
indeed
was
the
pride
and
delight
with
which
he
guided
me
from
one
holy
spot
to
another
every
now
and
then
when
he
came
to
an
unoccupied
shrine
he
fell
down
on
his
knees
and
performed
devotion
he
was
almost
distracted
by
the
temptations
that
surrounded
him
there
were
so
many
stones
absolutely
requiring
to
be
kissed
that
he
rushed
about
happily
puzzled
and
sweetly
teased
like
jack
among
the
a
protestant
familiar
with
the
holy
scriptures
but
ignorant
of
tradition
and
the
geography
of
modern
jerusalem
finds
himself
a
good
deal
mazed
when
he
first
looks
for
the
sacred
sites
the
holy
sepulchre
is
not
in
a
field
without
the
walls
but
in
the
midst
and
in
the
best
part
of
the
town
under
the
roof
of
the
great
church
which
i
have
been
talking
about
it
is
a
handsome
tomb
of
oblong
form
partly
subterranean
and
partly
above
ground
and
closed
in
on
all
sides
except
the
one
by
which
it
is
entered
you
descend
into
the
interior
by
a
few
steps
and
there
find
an
altar
with
burning
tapers
this
is
the
spot
which
is
held
in
greater
sanctity
than
any
other
at
jerusalem
when
you
have
seen
enough
of
it
you
feel
perhaps
weary
of
the
busy
crowd
and
inclined
for
a
gallop
you
ask
your
dragoman
whether
there
will
be
time
before
sunset
to
procure
horses
and
take
a
ride
to
mount
calvary
mount
calvary
signor
it
is
the
in
effect
you
ascend
if
i
remember
rightly
just
thirteen
steps
and
then
you
are
shown
the
now
golden
sockets
in
which
the
crosses
of
our
lord
and
the
two
thieves
were
fixed
all
this
is
startling
but
the
truth
is
that
the
city
having
gathered
round
the
sepulchre
which
is
the
main
point
of
interest
has
crept
northward
and
thus
in
great
measure
are
occasioned
the
many
geographical
surprises
that
puzzle
the
bible
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
comprises
very
compendiously
almost
all
the
spots
associated
with
the
closing
career
of
our
lord
just
there
on
your
right
he
stood
and
wept
by
the
pillar
on
your
left
he
was
scourged
on
the
spot
just
before
you
he
was
crowned
with
the
crown
of
thorns
up
there
he
was
crucified
and
down
here
he
was
buried
a
locality
is
assigned
to
every
the
minutest
event
connected
with
the
recorded
history
of
our
saviour
even
the
spot
where
the
cock
crew
when
peter
denied
his
master
is
ascertained
and
surrounded
by
the
walls
of
an
armenian
convent
many
protestants
are
wont
to
treat
these
traditions
contemptuously
and
those
who
distinguish
themselves
from
their
brethren
by
the
appellation
of
bible
christians
are
almost
fierce
in
their
denunciation
of
these
supposed
errors
it
is
admitted
i
believe
by
everybody
that
the
formal
sanctification
of
these
spots
was
the
act
of
the
empress
helena
the
mother
of
constantine
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
she
was
guided
by
a
careful
regard
to
the
then
prevailing
traditions
now
the
nature
of
the
ground
upon
which
jerusalem
stands
is
such
that
the
localities
belonging
to
the
events
there
enacted
might
have
been
more
easily
and
permanently
ascertained
by
tradition
than
those
of
any
city
that
i
know
of
jerusalem
whether
ancient
or
modern
was
built
upon
and
surrounded
by
sharp
salient
rocks
intersected
by
deep
ravines
up
to
the
time
of
the
siege
mount
calvary
of
course
must
have
been
well
enough
known
to
the
people
of
jerusalem
the
destruction
of
the
mere
buildings
could
not
have
obliterated
from
any
man
s
memory
the
names
of
those
steep
rocks
and
narrow
ravines
in
the
midst
of
which
the
city
had
stood
it
seems
to
me
therefore
highly
probable
that
in
fixing
the
site
of
calvary
the
empress
was
rightly
guided
recollect
too
that
the
voice
of
tradition
at
jerusalem
is
quite
unanimous
and
that
romans
greeks
armenians
and
jews
all
hating
each
other
sincerely
concur
in
assigning
the
same
localities
to
the
events
told
in
the
gospel
i
concede
however
that
the
attempt
of
the
empress
to
ascertain
the
sites
of
the
minor
events
can
not
be
safely
relied
upon
with
respect
for
instance
to
the
certainty
of
the
spot
where
the
cock
crew
i
am
far
from
being
convinced
supposing
that
the
empress
acted
arbitrarily
in
fixing
the
holy
sites
it
would
seem
that
she
followed
the
gospel
of
john
and
that
the
geography
sanctioned
by
her
can
be
more
easily
reconciled
with
that
history
than
with
the
accounts
of
the
other
evangelists
the
authority
exercised
by
the
mussulman
government
in
relation
to
the
holy
sites
is
in
one
view
somewhat
humbling
to
the
christians
for
it
is
almost
as
an
arbitrator
between
the
contending
sects
this
always
of
course
for
the
sake
of
pecuniary
advantage
that
the
mussulman
lends
his
contemptuous
aid
he
not
only
grants
but
enforces
toleration
all
persons
of
whatever
religion
are
allowed
to
go
as
they
will
into
every
part
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
but
in
order
to
prevent
indecent
contests
and
also
from
motives
arising
out
of
money
payments
the
turkish
government
assigns
the
peculiar
care
of
each
sacred
spot
to
one
of
the
ecclesiastic
bodies
since
this
guardianship
carries
with
it
the
receipt
of
the
coins
which
the
pilgrims
leave
upon
the
shrines
it
is
strenuously
fought
for
by
all
the
rival
churches
and
the
artifices
of
intrigue
are
busily
exerted
at
stamboul
in
order
to
procure
the
issue
or
revocation
of
the
firmans
by
which
the
coveted
privilege
is
granted
in
this
strife
the
greek
church
has
of
late
years
signally
triumphed
and
the
most
famous
of
the
shrines
are
committed
to
the
care
of
their
priesthood
they
possess
the
golden
socket
in
which
stood
the
cross
of
our
lord
whilst
the
latins
are
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
the
apertures
in
which
were
inserted
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
they
are
naturally
discontented
with
that
poor
privilege
and
sorrowfully
look
back
to
the
days
of
their
former
days
when
napoleon
was
emperor
and
sebastiani
ambassador
at
the
porte
it
seems
that
the
citizen
sultan
old
louis
philippe
has
done
very
little
indeed
for
holy
church
in
palestine
although
the
pilgrims
perform
their
devotions
at
the
several
shrines
with
so
little
apparent
enthusiasm
they
are
driven
to
the
verge
of
madness
by
the
miracle
displayed
before
them
on
easter
saturday
then
it
is
that
the
fire
issues
from
the
holy
sepulchre
the
pilgrims
all
assemble
in
the
great
church
and
already
long
before
the
wonder
is
worked
they
are
wrought
by
anticipation
of
god
s
sign
as
well
as
by
their
struggles
for
room
and
breathing
space
to
a
most
frightful
state
of
excitement
at
length
the
chief
priest
of
the
greeks
accompanied
of
all
people
in
the
world
by
the
turkish
governor
enters
the
tomb
after
this
there
is
a
long
pause
and
then
suddenly
from
out
of
the
small
apertures
on
either
side
of
the
sepulchre
there
issue
long
shining
flames
the
pilgrims
now
rush
forward
madly
struggling
to
light
their
tapers
at
the
holy
fire
this
is
the
dangerous
moment
and
many
lives
are
often
lost
the
year
before
that
of
my
going
to
jerusalem
ibrahim
pasha
from
some
whim
or
motive
of
policy
chose
to
witness
the
miracle
the
vast
church
was
of
course
thronged
as
it
always
is
on
that
awful
day
it
seems
that
the
appearance
of
the
fire
was
delayed
for
a
very
long
time
and
that
the
growing
frenzy
of
the
people
was
heightened
by
suspense
many
too
had
already
sunk
under
the
effect
of
the
heat
and
the
stifling
atmosphere
when
at
last
the
fire
flashed
from
the
sepulchre
then
a
terrible
struggle
ensued
many
sunk
and
were
crushed
ibrahim
had
taken
his
station
in
one
of
the
galleries
but
now
feeling
perhaps
his
brave
blood
warmed
by
the
sight
and
sound
of
such
strife
he
took
upon
himself
to
quiet
the
people
by
his
personal
presence
and
descended
into
the
body
of
the
church
with
only
a
few
guards
he
had
forced
his
way
into
the
midst
of
the
dense
crowd
when
unhappily
he
fainted
away
his
guards
shrieked
out
and
the
event
instantly
became
known
a
body
of
soldiers
recklessly
forced
their
way
through
the
crowd
trampling
over
every
obstacle
that
they
might
save
the
life
of
their
general
nearly
two
hundred
people
were
killed
in
the
struggle
the
following
year
however
the
government
took
better
measures
for
the
prevention
of
these
calamities
i
was
not
present
at
the
ceremony
having
gone
away
from
jerusalem
some
time
before
but
i
afterwards
returned
into
palestine
and
i
then
learned
that
the
day
had
passed
off
without
any
disturbance
of
a
fatal
kind
it
is
however
almost
too
much
to
expect
that
so
many
ministers
of
peace
can
assemble
without
finding
some
occasion
for
strife
and
in
that
year
a
tribe
of
wild
bedouins
became
the
subject
of
discord
these
men
it
seems
led
an
arab
life
in
some
of
the
desert
tracts
bordering
on
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
but
were
not
connected
with
any
of
the
great
ruling
tribes
some
whim
or
notion
of
policy
had
induced
them
to
embrace
christianity
but
they
were
grossly
ignorant
of
the
rudiments
of
their
adopted
faith
and
having
no
priest
with
them
in
their
desert
they
had
as
little
knowledge
of
religious
ceremonies
as
of
religion
itself
they
were
not
even
capable
of
conducting
themselves
in
a
place
of
worship
with
ordinary
decorum
but
would
interrupt
the
service
with
scandalous
cries
and
warlike
shouts
such
is
the
account
the
latins
give
of
them
but
i
have
never
heard
the
other
side
of
the
question
these
wild
fellows
notwithstanding
their
entire
ignorance
of
all
religion
are
yet
claimed
by
the
greeks
not
only
as
proselytes
who
have
embraced
christianity
generally
but
as
converts
to
the
particular
doctrines
and
practice
of
their
church
the
people
thus
alleged
to
have
concurred
in
the
great
schism
of
the
eastern
empire
are
never
i
believe
within
the
walls
of
a
church
or
even
of
any
building
at
all
except
upon
this
occasion
of
easter
and
as
they
then
never
fail
to
find
a
row
of
some
kind
going
on
by
the
side
of
the
sepulchre
they
fancy
it
seems
that
the
ceremonies
there
enacted
are
funeral
games
of
a
martial
character
held
in
honour
of
a
deceased
chieftain
and
that
a
christian
festival
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
battle
fought
between
walls
and
without
cavalry
it
does
not
appear
however
that
these
men
are
guilty
of
any
ferocious
acts
or
that
they
attempt
to
commit
depredations
the
charge
against
them
is
merely
that
by
their
way
of
applauding
the
performance
by
their
horrible
cries
and
frightful
gestures
they
destroy
the
solemnity
of
divine
service
and
upon
this
ground
the
franciscans
obtained
a
firman
for
the
exclusion
of
such
tumultuous
worshippers
the
greeks
however
did
not
choose
to
lose
the
aid
of
their
wild
converts
merely
because
they
were
a
little
backward
in
their
religious
education
and
they
therefore
persuaded
them
to
defy
the
firman
by
entering
the
city
and
overawing
their
enemies
the
franciscans
as
well
as
the
government
authorities
were
obliged
to
give
way
and
the
arabs
triumphantly
marched
into
the
church
the
festival
however
must
have
seemed
to
them
rather
flat
for
although
there
may
have
been
some
casualties
in
the
way
of
eyes
black
and
noses
bloody
and
women
missing
there
was
no
return
of
formerly
the
latin
catholics
concurred
in
acknowledging
but
not
i
hope
in
working
the
annual
miracle
of
the
heavenly
fire
but
they
have
for
many
years
withdrawn
their
countenance
from
this
exhibition
and
they
now
repudiate
it
as
a
trick
of
the
greek
church
thus
of
course
the
violence
of
feeling
with
which
the
rival
churches
meet
at
the
holy
sepulchre
on
easter
saturday
is
greatly
increased
and
a
disturbance
of
some
kind
is
certain
in
the
year
i
speak
of
though
no
lives
were
lost
there
was
as
it
seems
a
tough
struggle
in
the
church
i
was
amused
at
hearing
of
a
taunt
that
was
thrown
that
day
upon
an
english
traveller
he
had
taken
his
station
in
a
convenient
part
of
the
church
and
was
no
doubt
displaying
that
peculiar
air
of
serenity
and
gratification
with
which
an
english
gentleman
usually
looks
on
at
a
row
when
one
of
the
franciscans
came
by
all
reeking
from
the
fight
and
was
so
disgusted
at
the
coolness
and
placid
contentment
of
the
englishman
who
was
a
guest
at
the
convent
that
he
forgot
his
monkish
humility
as
well
as
the
duties
of
hospitality
and
plainly
said
you
sleep
under
our
roof
you
eat
our
bread
you
drink
our
wine
and
then
when
easter
saturday
comes
you
don
t
fight
for
us
yet
these
rival
churches
go
on
quietly
enough
till
their
blood
is
up
the
terms
on
which
they
live
remind
one
of
the
peculiar
relation
subsisting
at
cambridge
between
town
and
these
contests
and
disturbances
certainly
do
not
originate
with
the
the
great
body
of
whom
are
as
i
believe
quiet
and
inoffensive
people
it
is
true
however
that
their
pious
enterprise
is
believed
by
them
to
operate
as
a
counterpoise
for
a
multitude
of
sins
whether
past
or
future
and
perhaps
they
exert
themselves
in
after
life
to
restore
the
balance
of
good
and
evil
the
turks
have
a
maxim
which
like
most
cynical
apophthegms
carries
with
it
the
buzzing
trumpet
of
falsehood
as
well
as
the
small
fine
sting
of
if
your
friend
has
made
the
pilgrimage
once
distrust
him
if
he
has
made
the
pilgrimage
twice
cut
him
dead
the
caution
is
said
to
be
as
applicable
to
the
visitants
of
jerusalem
as
to
those
of
mecca
but
i
can
not
help
believing
that
the
frailties
of
all
the
hadjis
whether
christian
or
mahometan
are
greatly
exaggerated
i
certainly
regarded
the
pilgrims
to
palestine
as
a
orderly
body
of
people
not
strongly
enthusiastic
but
desirous
to
comply
with
the
ordinances
of
their
religion
and
to
attain
the
great
end
of
salvation
as
quietly
and
economically
as
possible
when
the
solemnities
of
easter
are
concluded
the
pilgrims
move
off
in
a
body
to
complete
their
good
work
by
visiting
the
sacred
scenes
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
including
the
wilderness
of
john
the
baptist
bethlehem
and
above
all
the
jordan
for
to
bathe
in
those
sacred
waters
is
one
of
the
chief
objects
of
the
expedition
all
the
women
and
submerged
and
the
saturated
linen
is
carefully
wrapped
up
and
preserved
as
a
that
shall
enure
for
salvation
in
the
realms
of
death
i
saw
the
burial
of
a
pilgrim
he
was
a
greek
miserably
poor
and
very
old
he
had
just
crawled
into
the
holy
city
and
had
reached
at
once
the
goal
of
his
pious
journey
and
the
end
of
his
sufferings
upon
earth
there
was
no
coffin
nor
wrapper
and
as
i
looked
full
upon
the
face
of
the
dead
i
saw
how
deeply
it
was
rutted
with
the
ruts
of
age
and
misery
the
priest
strong
and
portly
fresh
fat
and
alive
with
the
life
of
the
animal
kingdom
unpaid
or
ill
paid
for
his
work
would
scarcely
deign
to
mutter
out
his
forms
but
hurried
over
the
words
with
shocking
haste
presently
he
called
out
impatiently
yalla
goor
come
look
sharp
and
then
the
dead
greek
was
seized
his
limbs
yielded
inertly
to
the
rude
men
that
handled
them
and
down
he
went
into
his
grave
so
roughly
bundled
in
that
his
neck
was
twisted
by
the
fall
so
twisted
that
if
the
sharp
malady
of
life
were
still
upon
him
the
old
man
would
have
shrieked
and
groaned
and
the
lines
of
his
face
would
have
quivered
with
pain
the
lines
of
his
face
were
not
moved
and
the
old
man
lay
still
and
heedless
so
well
cured
of
that
tedious
that
nothing
could
hurt
him
now
his
clay
was
firm
and
tough
the
pilgrim
had
found
great
rest
i
threw
the
accustomed
handful
of
the
holy
soil
upon
his
patient
face
and
then
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
earth
closed
coldly
around
him
i
did
not
say
alas
nobody
ever
does
that
i
know
of
though
the
word
is
so
frequently
written
i
thought
the
old
man
had
got
rather
well
out
of
the
scrape
of
being
alive
and
poor
the
destruction
of
the
mere
buildings
in
such
a
place
as
jerusalem
would
not
involve
the
permanent
dispersion
of
the
inhabitants
for
the
rocky
neighbourhood
in
which
the
town
is
situate
abounds
in
caves
which
would
give
an
easy
refuge
to
the
people
until
they
gained
an
opportunity
of
rebuilding
their
dwellings
therefore
i
could
not
help
looking
upon
the
jews
of
jerusalem
as
being
in
some
sort
the
representatives
if
not
the
actual
descendants
of
the
rascals
who
crucified
our
saviour
supposing
this
to
be
the
case
i
felt
that
there
would
be
some
interest
in
knowing
how
the
events
of
the
gospel
history
were
regarded
by
the
israelites
of
modern
jerusalem
the
result
of
my
inquiry
upon
this
subject
was
so
far
as
it
went
entirely
favourable
to
the
truth
of
christianity
i
understood
that
performance
of
the
miracles
was
not
doubted
by
any
of
the
jews
in
the
all
of
them
concurred
in
attributing
the
works
of
our
lord
to
the
influence
of
magic
but
they
were
divided
as
to
the
species
of
enchantment
from
which
the
power
proceeded
the
great
mass
of
the
jewish
people
believe
i
fancy
that
the
miracles
had
been
wrought
by
aid
of
the
powers
of
darkness
but
many
and
those
the
more
enlightened
would
call
jesus
the
good
to
europeans
repudiating
the
notion
of
all
magic
good
or
bad
the
opinion
of
the
jews
as
to
the
agency
by
which
the
miracles
were
worked
is
a
matter
of
no
importance
but
the
circumstance
of
their
admitting
that
those
miracles
in
fact
is
certainly
curious
and
perhaps
not
quite
immaterial
if
you
stay
in
the
holy
city
long
enough
to
fall
into
anything
like
regular
habits
of
amusement
and
occupation
and
to
become
in
short
for
a
time
a
man
about
town
at
jerusalem
you
will
necessarily
lose
the
enthusiasm
which
you
may
have
felt
when
you
trod
the
sacred
soil
for
the
first
time
and
it
will
then
seem
almost
strange
to
you
to
find
yourself
so
entirely
surrounded
in
all
your
daily
pursuits
by
the
designs
and
sounds
of
religion
your
hotel
is
a
monastery
your
rooms
are
cells
the
landlord
is
a
stately
abbot
and
the
waiters
are
hooded
monks
if
you
walk
out
of
the
town
you
find
yourself
on
the
mount
of
olives
or
in
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
or
on
the
hill
of
evil
counsel
if
you
mount
your
horse
and
extend
your
rambles
you
will
be
guided
to
the
wilderness
of
john
or
the
birthplace
of
our
saviour
your
club
is
the
great
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
where
everybody
meets
everybody
every
day
if
you
lounge
through
the
town
your
bond
street
is
the
via
dolorosa
and
the
object
of
your
hopeless
affections
is
some
maid
or
matron
all
forlorn
and
sadly
shrouded
in
her
pilgrim
s
robe
if
you
would
hear
music
it
must
be
the
chanting
of
friars
if
you
look
at
pictures
you
see
virgins
with
arms
or
devils
out
of
drawing
or
angels
tumbling
up
the
skies
in
impious
perspective
if
you
would
make
any
purchases
you
must
go
again
to
the
church
doors
and
when
you
inquire
for
the
manufactures
of
the
place
you
find
that
they
consist
of
beads
and
sanctified
shells
these
last
are
the
favourite
tokens
which
the
pilgrims
carry
off
with
them
the
shell
is
graven
or
rather
scratched
on
the
white
side
with
a
rude
drawing
of
the
blessed
virgin
or
of
the
crucifixion
or
some
other
scriptural
subject
having
passed
this
stage
it
goes
into
the
hands
of
a
priest
by
him
it
is
subjected
to
some
process
for
rendering
it
efficacious
against
the
schemes
of
our
ghostly
enemy
the
manufacture
is
then
complete
and
is
deemed
to
be
fit
for
use
the
village
of
bethlehem
lies
prettily
couched
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
the
sanctuary
is
a
subterranean
grotto
and
is
committed
to
the
of
the
romans
greeks
and
armenians
who
vie
with
each
other
in
adorning
it
beneath
an
altar
gorgeously
decorated
and
lit
with
everlasting
fires
there
stands
the
low
slab
of
stone
which
marks
the
holy
site
of
the
nativity
and
near
to
this
is
a
hollow
scooped
out
of
the
living
rock
here
the
infant
jesus
was
laid
near
the
spot
of
the
nativity
is
the
rock
against
which
the
blessed
virgin
was
leaning
when
she
presented
her
babe
to
the
adoring
shepherds
many
of
those
protestants
who
are
accustomed
to
despise
tradition
consider
that
this
sanctuary
is
altogether
unscriptural
that
a
grotto
is
not
a
stable
and
that
mangers
are
made
of
wood
it
is
perfectly
true
however
that
the
many
grottoes
and
caves
which
are
found
among
the
rocks
of
judea
were
formerly
used
for
the
reception
of
cattle
they
are
so
used
at
this
day
i
have
myself
seen
grottoes
appropriated
to
this
purpose
you
know
what
a
sad
and
sombre
decorum
it
is
that
outwardly
reigns
through
the
lands
oppressed
by
moslem
sway
mahometans
make
beauty
their
prisoner
and
enforce
such
a
stern
and
gloomy
morality
or
at
all
events
such
a
frightfully
close
semblance
of
it
that
far
and
long
the
wearied
traveller
may
go
without
catching
one
glimpse
of
outward
happiness
by
a
strange
chance
in
these
latter
days
it
happened
that
alone
of
all
the
places
in
the
land
this
bethlehem
the
native
village
of
our
lord
escaped
the
moral
yoke
of
the
mussulmans
and
heard
again
after
ages
of
dull
oppression
the
cheering
clatter
of
social
freedom
and
the
voices
of
laughing
girls
it
was
after
an
insurrection
which
had
been
raised
against
the
authority
of
mehemet
ali
that
bethlehem
was
freed
from
the
hateful
laws
of
asiatic
decorum
the
mussulmans
of
the
village
had
taken
an
active
part
in
the
movement
and
when
ibrahim
had
quelled
it
his
wrath
was
still
so
hot
that
he
put
to
death
every
one
of
the
few
mahometans
of
bethlehem
who
had
not
already
fled
the
effect
produced
upon
the
christian
inhabitants
by
the
sudden
removal
of
this
restraint
was
immense
the
village
smiled
once
more
it
is
true
that
such
sweet
freedom
could
not
long
endure
even
if
the
population
of
the
place
should
continue
to
be
entirely
christian
the
sad
decorum
of
the
mussulmans
or
rather
of
the
asiatics
would
sooner
or
later
be
restored
by
the
force
of
opinion
and
custom
but
for
a
while
the
sunshine
would
last
and
when
i
was
at
bethlehem
though
long
after
the
flight
of
the
mussulmans
the
cloud
of
moslem
propriety
had
not
yet
come
back
to
cast
its
cold
shadow
upon
life
when
you
reach
that
gladsome
village
pray
heaven
there
still
may
be
heard
there
the
voice
of
free
innocent
girls
it
will
sound
so
dearly
welcome
to
a
christian
and
thoroughbred
englishman
not
even
the
licentiousness
which
generally
accompanies
it
can
compensate
for
the
oppressiveness
of
that
horrible
outward
decorum
which
turns
the
cities
and
the
palaces
of
asia
into
deserts
and
gaols
so
i
say
when
you
see
and
hear
them
those
romping
girls
of
bethlehem
will
gladden
your
very
soul
distant
at
first
and
then
nearer
and
nearer
the
timid
flock
will
gather
around
you
with
their
large
burning
eyes
gravely
fixed
against
yours
so
that
they
see
into
your
brain
and
if
you
imagine
evil
against
them
they
will
know
of
your
ill
thought
before
it
is
yet
well
born
and
will
fly
and
be
gone
in
the
moment
but
presently
if
you
will
only
look
virtuous
enough
to
prevent
alarm
and
vicious
enough
to
avoid
looking
silly
the
blithe
maidens
will
draw
nearer
and
nearer
to
you
and
soon
there
will
be
one
the
bravest
of
the
sisters
who
will
venture
right
up
to
your
side
and
touch
the
hem
of
your
coat
in
playful
defiance
of
the
danger
and
then
the
rest
will
follow
the
daring
of
their
youthful
leader
and
gather
close
round
you
and
hold
a
shrill
controversy
on
the
wondrous
formation
that
you
call
a
hat
and
the
cunning
of
the
hands
that
clothed
you
with
cloth
so
fine
and
then
growing
more
profound
in
their
researches
they
will
pass
from
the
study
of
your
mere
dress
to
a
serious
contemplation
of
your
stately
height
and
your
hair
and
the
ruddy
glow
of
your
english
cheeks
and
if
they
catch
a
glimpse
of
your
ungloved
fingers
then
again
will
they
make
the
air
ring
with
their
sweet
screams
of
wonder
and
amazement
as
they
compare
the
fairness
of
your
hand
with
their
warmer
tints
and
even
with
the
hues
of
your
own
sunburnt
face
instantly
the
ringleader
of
the
gentle
rioters
imagines
a
new
sin
with
tremulous
boldness
she
touches
then
grasps
your
hand
and
smoothes
it
gently
betwixt
her
own
and
pries
curiously
into
its
make
and
colour
as
though
it
were
silk
of
damascus
or
shawl
of
cashmere
and
when
they
see
you
even
then
still
sage
and
gentle
the
joyous
girls
will
suddenly
and
screamingly
and
all
at
once
explain
to
each
other
that
you
are
surely
quite
harmless
and
innocent
a
lion
that
makes
no
spring
a
bear
that
never
hugs
and
upon
this
faith
one
after
the
other
they
will
take
your
passive
hand
and
strive
to
explain
it
and
make
it
a
theme
and
a
controversy
but
the
one
the
fairest
and
the
sweetest
of
all
is
yet
the
most
timid
she
shrinks
from
the
daring
deeds
of
her
playmates
and
seeks
shelter
behind
their
sleeves
and
strives
to
screen
her
glowing
consciousness
from
the
eyes
that
look
upon
her
but
her
laughing
sisters
will
have
none
of
this
cowardice
they
vow
that
the
fair
one
be
their
complice
share
their
dangers
touch
the
hand
of
the
stranger
they
seize
her
small
wrist
and
drag
her
forward
by
force
and
at
last
whilst
yet
she
strives
to
turn
away
and
to
cover
up
her
whole
soul
under
the
folds
of
downcast
eyelids
they
vanquish
her
utmost
strength
they
vanquish
your
utmost
modesty
and
marry
her
hand
to
yours
the
quick
pulse
springs
from
her
fingers
and
throbs
like
a
whisper
upon
your
listening
palm
for
an
instant
her
large
timid
eyes
are
upon
you
in
an
instant
they
are
shrouded
again
and
there
comes
a
blush
so
burning
that
the
frightened
girls
stay
their
shrill
laughter
as
though
they
had
played
too
perilously
and
harmed
their
gentle
sister
a
moment
and
all
with
a
sudden
intelligence
turn
away
and
fly
like
deer
yet
soon
again
like
deer
they
wheel
round
and
return
and
stand
and
gaze
upon
the
danger
until
they
grow
brave
once
more
i
regret
to
observe
that
the
removal
of
the
moral
restraint
imposed
by
the
presence
of
the
mahometan
inhabitants
has
led
to
a
certain
degree
of
boisterous
though
innocent
levity
in
the
bearing
of
the
christians
and
more
especially
in
the
demeanour
of
those
who
belong
to
the
younger
portion
of
the
female
population
but
i
feel
assured
that
a
more
thorough
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
their
own
pure
religion
will
speedily
restore
these
young
people
to
habits
of
propriety
even
more
strict
than
those
which
were
imposed
upon
them
by
the
authority
of
their
mahometan
bah
thus
you
might
chant
if
you
chose
but
loving
the
truth
you
will
not
so
disown
sweet
bethlehem
you
will
not
disown
or
dissemble
your
right
good
hearty
delight
when
you
find
as
though
in
a
desert
this
gushing
spring
of
fresh
and
joyous
girlhood
chapter
xvii
the
desert
gaza
is
upon
the
verge
of
the
desert
to
which
it
stands
in
the
same
relation
as
a
seaport
to
the
sea
it
is
there
that
you
your
camels
the
ships
of
the
desert
and
lay
in
your
stores
for
the
voyage
these
preparations
kept
me
in
the
town
for
some
days
disliking
restraint
i
declined
making
myself
the
guest
of
the
governor
as
it
is
usual
and
proper
to
do
but
took
up
my
quarters
at
the
caravanserai
or
khan
as
they
call
it
in
that
part
of
asia
dthemetri
had
to
make
the
arrangements
for
my
journey
and
in
order
to
arm
himself
with
sufficient
authority
for
doing
all
that
was
required
he
found
it
necessary
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
the
governor
the
result
of
this
diplomatic
intercourse
was
that
the
governor
with
his
train
of
attendants
came
to
me
one
day
at
my
caravanserai
and
formally
complained
that
dthemetri
had
grossly
insulted
him
i
was
shocked
at
this
for
the
man
was
always
attentive
and
civil
to
me
and
i
was
disgusted
at
the
idea
of
his
having
been
rewarded
with
insult
dthemetri
was
present
when
the
complaint
was
made
and
i
angrily
asked
him
whether
it
was
true
that
he
had
really
insulted
the
governor
and
what
the
deuce
he
meant
by
it
this
i
asked
with
the
full
certainty
that
dthemetri
as
a
matter
of
course
would
deny
the
charge
would
swear
that
a
wrong
construction
had
been
put
upon
his
words
and
that
nothing
was
further
from
his
thoughts
etc
after
the
manner
of
the
parliamentary
people
but
to
my
surprise
he
very
plainly
answered
that
he
certainly
insulted
the
governor
and
that
rather
grossly
but
he
said
it
was
quite
necessary
to
do
this
in
order
to
strike
terror
and
inspire
terror
and
respect
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
by
that
nonsense
yes
but
without
striking
terror
and
inspiring
respect
he
dthemetri
would
never
be
able
to
force
on
the
arrangements
for
my
journey
and
vossignoria
would
be
kept
at
gaza
for
a
month
this
would
have
been
awkward
and
certainly
i
could
not
deny
that
poor
dthemetri
had
succeeded
in
his
odd
plan
of
inspiring
respect
for
at
the
very
time
that
this
explanation
was
going
on
in
italian
the
governor
seemed
more
than
ever
and
more
anxiously
disposed
to
overwhelm
me
with
assurances
of
goodwill
and
proffers
of
his
best
services
all
this
kindness
or
promise
of
kindness
i
naturally
received
with
courtesy
that
greatly
perturbed
dthemetri
for
he
evidently
feared
that
my
civility
would
undo
all
the
good
that
his
insults
had
achieved
you
will
find
i
think
that
one
of
the
greatest
drawbacks
to
the
pleasure
of
travelling
in
asia
is
the
being
obliged
more
or
less
to
make
your
way
by
bullying
it
is
true
that
your
own
lips
are
not
soiled
by
the
utterance
of
all
the
mean
words
that
are
spoken
for
you
and
that
you
don
t
even
know
of
the
sham
threats
and
the
false
promises
and
the
vainglorious
boasts
put
forth
by
your
dragoman
but
now
and
then
there
happens
some
incident
of
the
sort
which
i
have
just
been
mentioning
which
forces
you
to
believe
or
suspect
that
your
dragoman
is
habitually
fighting
your
battles
for
you
in
a
way
that
you
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
a
caravanserai
is
not
ill
adapted
to
the
purposes
for
which
it
is
meant
it
forms
the
four
sides
of
a
large
quadrangular
court
the
ground
floor
is
used
for
warehouses
the
first
floor
for
guests
and
the
open
court
for
the
temporary
reception
of
the
camels
as
well
as
for
the
loading
and
unloading
of
their
burthens
and
the
transaction
of
mercantile
business
generally
the
apartments
used
for
the
guests
are
small
cells
opening
into
a
corridor
which
runs
round
the
four
sides
of
the
court
whilst
i
lay
near
the
opening
of
my
cell
looking
down
into
the
court
below
there
arrived
from
the
desert
a
caravan
that
is
a
large
assemblage
of
travellers
it
consisted
chiefly
of
moldavian
pilgrims
who
to
make
their
good
work
even
more
than
complete
had
begun
by
visiting
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
in
egypt
and
were
now
going
on
to
jerusalem
they
had
been
overtaken
in
the
desert
by
a
gale
of
wind
which
so
drove
the
sand
and
raised
up
such
mountains
before
them
that
their
journey
had
been
terribly
perplexed
and
obstructed
and
their
provisions
including
water
the
most
precious
of
all
had
been
exhausted
long
before
they
reached
the
end
of
their
toilsome
march
they
were
sadly
wayworn
the
arrival
of
the
caravan
drew
many
and
various
groups
into
the
court
there
was
the
moldavian
pilgrim
with
his
sable
dress
and
cap
of
fur
and
heavy
masses
of
bushy
hair
the
turk
with
his
various
and
brilliant
garments
the
arab
superbly
stalking
under
his
striped
blanket
that
hung
like
royalty
upon
his
stately
form
the
jetty
ethiopian
in
his
slavish
frock
the
sleek
scribe
with
his
comely
pelisse
and
his
silver
stuck
in
like
a
dagger
at
his
girdle
and
mingled
with
these
were
the
camels
some
standing
some
kneeling
and
being
unladen
some
twisting
round
their
long
necks
and
gently
stealing
the
straw
from
out
of
their
own
in
a
couple
of
days
i
was
ready
to
start
the
way
of
providing
for
the
passage
of
the
desert
is
this
there
is
an
agent
in
the
town
who
keeps
himself
in
communication
with
some
of
the
desert
arabs
that
are
hovering
within
a
day
s
journey
of
the
place
a
party
of
these
upon
being
guaranteed
against
seizure
or
other
at
the
hands
of
the
governor
come
into
the
town
bringing
with
them
the
number
of
camels
which
you
require
and
then
they
stipulate
for
a
certain
sum
to
take
you
to
the
place
of
your
destination
in
a
given
time
the
agreement
which
they
thus
enter
into
includes
a
safe
conduct
through
their
country
as
well
as
the
hire
of
the
camels
according
to
the
contract
made
with
me
i
was
to
reach
cairo
within
ten
days
from
the
commencement
of
the
journey
i
had
four
camels
one
for
my
baggage
one
for
each
of
my
servants
and
one
for
myself
four
arabs
the
owners
of
the
camels
came
with
me
on
foot
my
stores
were
a
small
soldier
s
tent
two
bags
of
dried
bread
brought
from
the
convent
at
jerusalem
and
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
from
the
same
source
two
goatskins
filled
with
water
tea
sugar
a
cold
tongue
and
of
all
things
in
the
world
a
jar
of
irish
butter
which
mysseri
had
purchased
from
some
merchant
there
was
also
a
small
sack
of
charcoal
for
the
greater
part
of
the
desert
through
which
we
were
to
pass
is
destitute
of
fuel
the
camel
kneels
to
receive
her
load
and
for
a
while
she
will
allow
the
packing
to
go
on
with
silent
resignation
but
when
she
begins
to
suspect
that
her
master
is
putting
more
than
a
just
burthen
upon
her
poor
hump
she
turns
round
her
supple
neck
and
looks
sadly
upon
the
increasing
load
and
then
gently
remonstrates
against
the
wrong
with
the
sigh
of
a
patient
wife
if
sighs
will
not
move
you
she
can
weep
you
soon
learn
to
pity
and
soon
to
love
her
for
the
sake
of
her
gentle
and
womanish
ways
you
can
not
of
course
put
an
english
or
any
other
riding
saddle
upon
the
back
of
a
camel
but
your
quilt
or
carpet
or
whatever
you
carry
for
the
purpose
of
lying
on
at
night
is
folded
and
fastened
on
to
the
upon
the
top
of
the
hump
and
on
this
you
ride
or
rather
sit
you
sit
as
a
man
sits
on
a
chair
when
he
sits
astride
and
faces
the
back
of
it
i
made
an
improvement
on
this
plan
i
had
my
english
stirrups
strapped
on
to
the
of
the
and
thus
by
gaining
rest
for
my
dangling
legs
and
gaining
too
the
power
of
varying
my
position
more
easily
than
i
could
otherwise
have
done
i
added
very
much
to
my
comfort
don
t
forget
to
do
as
i
did
the
camel
like
the
elephant
is
one
of
the
sort
of
animals
that
still
walk
along
upon
the
now
nearly
exploded
plan
of
the
ancient
beasts
that
lived
before
the
flood
she
moves
forward
both
her
near
legs
at
the
same
time
and
then
awkwardly
swings
round
her
off
shoulder
and
haunch
so
as
to
repeat
the
manœuvre
on
that
side
her
pace
therefore
is
an
odd
disjointed
and
disjoining
sort
of
movement
that
is
rather
disagreeable
at
first
but
you
soon
grow
reconciled
to
it
the
height
to
which
you
are
raised
is
of
great
advantage
to
you
in
passing
the
burning
sands
of
the
desert
for
the
air
at
such
a
distance
from
the
ground
is
much
cooler
and
more
lively
than
that
which
circulates
beneath
for
several
miles
beyond
gaza
the
land
which
had
been
plentifully
watered
by
the
rains
of
the
last
week
was
covered
with
rich
verdure
and
thickly
jewelled
with
meadow
flowers
so
fresh
and
fragrant
that
i
began
to
grow
almost
uneasy
to
fancy
that
the
very
desert
was
receding
before
me
and
that
the
adventure
of
passing
its
burning
sands
was
to
end
in
a
mere
ride
across
a
field
but
as
i
advanced
the
true
character
of
the
country
began
to
display
itself
with
sufficient
clearness
to
dispel
my
apprehensions
and
before
the
close
of
my
first
day
s
journey
i
had
the
gratification
of
finding
that
i
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
tract
of
real
sand
and
had
nothing
at
all
to
complain
of
except
that
there
peeped
forth
at
intervals
a
few
isolated
blades
of
grass
and
many
of
those
stunted
shrubs
which
are
the
accustomed
food
of
the
camel
before
sunset
i
came
up
with
an
encampment
of
arabs
the
encampment
from
which
my
camels
had
been
brought
and
my
tent
was
pitched
amongst
theirs
i
was
now
amongst
the
true
bedouins
almost
every
man
of
this
race
closely
resembles
his
brethren
almost
every
man
has
large
and
finely
formed
features
but
his
face
is
so
thoroughly
stripped
of
flesh
and
the
white
folds
from
his
headgear
fall
down
by
his
haggard
cheeks
so
much
in
the
burial
fashion
that
he
looks
quite
sad
and
ghastly
his
large
dark
orbs
roll
slowly
and
solemnly
over
the
white
of
his
eyes
his
countenance
shows
painful
thought
and
the
suffering
of
one
fallen
from
a
high
estate
his
gait
is
strangely
majestic
and
he
marches
along
with
his
simple
blanket
as
though
he
were
wearing
the
purple
his
common
talk
is
a
series
of
piercing
screams
and
cries
more
painful
to
the
ear
than
the
most
excruciating
fine
music
that
i
ever
endured
the
bedouin
women
are
not
treasured
up
like
the
wives
and
daughters
of
other
orientals
and
indeed
they
seemed
almost
entirely
free
from
the
restraints
imposed
by
jealousy
the
feint
which
they
made
of
concealing
their
faces
from
me
was
always
slight
they
never
i
think
wore
the
properly
fixed
when
they
first
saw
me
they
used
to
hold
up
a
part
of
their
drapery
with
one
hand
across
their
faces
but
they
seldom
persevered
very
steadily
in
subjecting
me
to
this
privation
unhappy
beings
they
were
sadly
plain
the
awful
haggardness
that
gave
something
of
character
to
the
faces
of
the
men
was
sheer
ugliness
in
the
poor
women
it
is
a
great
shame
but
the
truth
is
that
except
when
we
refer
to
the
beautiful
devotion
of
the
mother
to
her
child
all
the
fine
things
we
say
and
think
about
women
apply
only
to
those
who
are
tolerably
or
graceful
these
arab
women
were
so
plain
and
clumsy
that
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
fit
for
nothing
but
another
and
a
better
world
they
may
have
been
good
women
enough
so
far
as
relates
to
the
exercise
of
the
minor
virtues
but
they
had
so
grossly
neglected
the
prime
duty
of
looking
pretty
in
this
transitory
life
that
i
could
not
at
all
forgive
them
they
seemed
to
feel
the
weight
of
their
guilt
and
to
be
truly
and
humbly
penitent
i
had
the
complete
command
of
their
affections
for
at
any
moment
i
could
make
their
young
hearts
bound
and
their
old
hearts
jump
by
offering
a
handful
of
tobacco
and
yet
believe
me
it
was
not
in
the
first
that
my
store
of
latakia
was
exhausted
the
bedouin
women
have
no
religion
this
is
partly
the
cause
of
their
clumsiness
perhaps
if
from
christian
girls
they
would
learn
how
to
pray
their
souls
might
become
more
gentle
and
their
limbs
be
clothed
with
grace
you
who
are
going
into
their
country
have
a
direct
personal
interest
in
knowing
something
about
arab
hospitality
but
the
deuce
of
it
is
that
the
poor
fellows
with
whom
i
have
happened
to
pitch
my
tent
were
scarcely
ever
in
a
condition
to
exercise
that
magnanimous
virtue
with
much
indeed
mysseri
s
canteen
generally
enabled
me
to
outdo
my
hosts
in
the
matter
of
entertainment
they
were
always
courteous
however
and
were
never
backward
in
offering
me
the
a
kind
of
whey
which
is
the
principal
delicacy
to
be
found
amongst
the
wandering
tribes
practically
i
think
childe
harold
would
have
found
it
a
dreadful
bore
to
make
the
desert
his
for
at
all
events
if
he
adopted
the
life
of
the
arabs
he
would
have
tasted
no
solitude
the
tents
are
partitioned
not
so
as
to
divide
the
childe
and
the
fair
spirit
who
is
his
minister
from
the
rest
of
the
world
but
so
as
to
separate
the
twenty
or
thirty
brown
men
that
sit
screaming
in
the
one
compartment
from
the
fifty
or
sixty
brown
women
and
children
that
scream
and
squeak
in
the
other
if
you
adopt
the
arab
life
for
the
sake
of
seclusion
you
will
be
horribly
disappointed
for
you
will
find
yourself
in
perpetual
contact
with
a
mass
of
hot
it
is
true
that
all
who
are
inmates
of
the
same
tent
are
related
to
each
other
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
that
circumstance
adds
much
to
the
charm
of
such
a
life
at
all
events
before
you
finally
determine
to
become
an
arab
try
a
gentle
experiment
take
one
of
those
small
shabby
houses
in
mayfair
and
shut
yourself
up
in
it
with
forty
or
fifty
shrill
cousins
for
a
couple
of
weeks
in
july
in
passing
the
desert
you
will
find
your
arabs
wanting
to
start
and
to
rest
at
all
sorts
of
odd
times
they
like
for
instance
to
be
off
at
one
in
the
morning
and
to
rest
during
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
you
must
not
give
way
to
their
wishes
in
this
respect
i
tried
their
plan
once
and
found
it
very
harassing
and
unwholesome
an
ordinary
tent
can
give
you
very
little
protection
against
heat
for
the
fire
strikes
fiercely
through
single
canvas
and
you
soon
find
that
whilst
you
lie
crouching
and
striving
to
hide
yourself
from
the
blazing
face
of
the
sun
his
power
is
harder
to
bear
than
it
is
where
you
boldly
defy
him
from
the
airy
heights
of
your
camel
it
had
been
arranged
with
my
arabs
that
they
were
to
bring
with
them
all
the
food
which
they
would
want
for
themselves
during
the
passage
of
the
desert
but
as
we
rested
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
s
journey
by
the
side
of
an
arab
encampment
my
camel
men
found
all
that
they
required
for
that
night
in
the
tents
of
their
own
brethren
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
however
just
before
we
encamped
for
the
night
my
four
arabs
came
to
dthemetri
and
formally
announced
that
they
had
not
brought
with
them
one
atom
of
food
and
that
they
looked
entirely
to
my
supplies
for
their
daily
bread
this
was
awkward
intelligence
we
were
now
just
two
days
deep
in
the
desert
and
i
had
brought
with
me
no
more
bread
than
might
be
reasonably
required
for
myself
and
my
european
attendants
i
believed
at
the
moment
for
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
men
had
really
mistaken
the
terms
of
the
arrangement
and
feeling
that
the
bore
of
being
put
upon
half
rations
would
be
a
less
evil
and
even
to
myself
a
less
inconvenience
than
the
starvation
of
my
arabs
i
at
once
told
dthemetri
to
assure
them
that
my
bread
should
be
equally
shared
with
all
dthemetri
however
did
not
approve
of
this
concession
he
assured
me
quite
positively
that
the
arabs
thoroughly
understood
the
agreement
and
that
if
they
were
now
without
food
they
had
wilfully
brought
themselves
into
this
strait
for
the
wretched
purpose
of
bettering
their
bargain
by
the
value
of
a
few
paras
worth
of
bread
this
suggestion
made
me
look
at
the
affair
in
a
new
light
i
should
have
been
glad
enough
to
put
up
with
the
slight
privation
to
which
my
concession
would
subject
me
and
could
have
borne
to
witness
the
of
poor
dthemetri
with
a
fine
philosophical
calm
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
scheme
if
scheme
it
were
had
something
of
audacity
in
it
and
was
well
enough
calculated
to
try
the
extent
of
my
softness
i
well
knew
the
danger
of
allowing
such
a
trial
to
result
in
a
conclusion
that
i
was
one
who
might
be
easily
managed
and
therefore
after
thoroughly
satisfying
myself
from
dthemetri
s
clear
and
repeated
assertions
that
the
arabs
had
really
understood
the
arrangement
i
determined
that
they
should
not
now
violate
it
by
taking
advantage
of
my
position
in
the
midst
of
their
big
desert
so
i
desired
dthemetri
to
tell
them
that
they
should
touch
no
bread
of
mine
we
stopped
and
the
tent
was
pitched
the
arabs
came
to
me
and
prayed
loudly
for
bread
i
refused
them
then
we
die
god
s
will
be
done
i
gave
the
arabs
to
understand
that
i
regretted
their
perishing
by
hunger
but
that
i
should
bear
this
calmly
like
any
other
misfortune
not
my
own
that
in
short
i
was
happily
resigned
to
fate
the
men
would
have
talked
a
great
deal
but
they
were
under
the
disadvantage
of
addressing
me
through
a
hostile
interpreter
they
looked
hard
upon
my
face
but
they
found
no
hope
there
so
at
last
they
retired
as
they
pretended
to
lay
them
down
and
die
in
about
ten
minutes
from
this
time
i
found
that
the
arabs
were
busily
cooking
their
bread
their
pretence
of
having
brought
no
food
was
false
and
was
only
invented
for
the
purpose
of
saving
it
they
had
a
good
bag
of
meal
which
they
had
contrived
to
stow
away
under
the
baggage
upon
one
of
the
camels
in
such
a
way
as
to
escape
notice
in
europe
the
detection
of
a
scheme
like
this
would
have
occasioned
a
disagreeable
feeling
between
the
master
and
the
delinquent
but
you
would
no
more
recoil
from
an
oriental
on
account
of
a
matter
of
this
sort
than
in
england
you
would
reject
a
horse
that
had
tried
and
failed
to
throw
you
indeed
i
felt
quite
towards
my
arabs
because
they
had
so
woefully
failed
in
their
wretched
attempt
and
because
as
it
turned
out
i
had
done
what
was
right
they
too
poor
fellows
evidently
began
to
like
me
immensely
on
account
of
the
which
had
enabled
me
to
baffle
their
scheme
the
arabs
adhere
to
those
ancestral
principles
of
which
have
been
sanctioned
by
the
experience
of
ages
the
very
first
baker
of
bread
that
ever
lived
must
have
done
his
work
exactly
as
the
arab
does
at
this
day
he
takes
some
meal
and
holds
it
out
in
the
hollow
of
his
hands
whilst
his
comrade
pours
over
it
a
few
drops
of
water
he
then
mashes
up
the
moistened
flour
into
a
paste
which
he
pulls
into
small
pieces
and
thrusts
into
the
embers
his
way
of
baking
exactly
resembles
the
craft
or
mystery
of
roasting
chestnuts
as
practised
by
children
there
is
the
same
prudence
and
circumspection
in
choosing
a
good
berth
for
the
morsel
the
same
enterprise
and
valour
in
pulling
it
out
with
the
fingers
the
manner
of
my
daily
march
was
this
at
about
an
hour
before
dawn
i
rose
and
made
the
most
of
about
a
pint
of
water
which
i
allowed
myself
for
washing
then
i
breakfasted
upon
tea
and
bread
as
soon
as
the
beasts
were
loaded
i
mounted
my
camel
and
pressed
forward
my
poor
arabs
being
on
foot
would
sometimes
moan
with
fatigue
and
pray
for
rest
but
i
was
anxious
to
enable
them
to
perform
their
contract
for
bringing
me
to
cairo
within
the
stipulated
time
and
i
did
not
therefore
allow
a
halt
until
the
evening
came
about
midday
or
soon
after
mysseri
used
to
bring
up
his
camel
alongside
of
mine
and
supply
me
with
a
piece
of
bread
softened
in
water
for
it
was
dried
hard
like
board
and
also
as
long
as
it
lasted
with
a
piece
of
the
tongue
after
this
there
came
into
my
hand
how
well
i
remember
it
the
little
tin
cup
with
wine
and
water
as
long
as
you
are
journeying
in
the
interior
of
the
desert
you
have
no
particular
point
to
make
for
as
your
the
endless
sands
yield
nothing
but
small
stunted
shrubs
even
these
fail
after
the
first
two
or
three
days
and
from
that
time
you
pass
over
broad
plains
you
pass
over
newly
reared
hills
you
pass
through
valleys
that
the
storm
of
the
last
week
has
dug
and
the
hills
and
the
valleys
are
sand
sand
sand
still
sand
and
only
sand
and
sand
and
sand
again
the
earth
is
so
samely
that
your
eyes
turn
towards
heaven
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
sky
you
look
to
the
sun
for
he
is
your
taskmaster
and
by
him
you
know
the
measure
of
the
work
that
you
have
done
and
the
measure
of
the
work
that
remains
for
you
to
do
he
comes
when
you
strike
your
tent
in
the
early
morning
and
then
for
the
first
hour
of
the
day
as
you
move
forward
on
your
camel
he
stands
at
your
near
side
and
makes
you
know
that
the
whole
day
s
toil
is
before
you
then
for
a
while
and
a
long
while
you
see
him
no
more
for
you
are
veiled
and
shrouded
and
dare
not
look
upon
the
greatness
of
his
glory
but
you
know
where
he
strides
overhead
by
the
touch
of
his
flaming
sword
no
words
are
spoken
but
your
arabs
moan
your
camels
sigh
your
skin
glows
your
shoulders
ache
and
for
sights
you
see
the
pattern
and
the
web
of
the
silk
that
veils
your
eyes
and
the
glare
of
the
outer
light
time
labours
on
your
skin
glows
and
your
shoulders
ache
your
arabs
moan
your
camels
sigh
and
you
see
the
same
pattern
in
the
silk
and
the
same
glare
of
light
beyond
but
conquering
time
marches
on
and
by
and
by
the
descending
sun
has
compassed
the
heaven
and
now
softly
touches
your
right
arm
and
throws
your
lank
shadow
over
the
sand
right
along
on
the
way
to
persia
then
again
you
look
upon
his
face
for
his
power
is
all
veiled
in
his
beauty
and
the
redness
of
flames
has
become
the
redness
of
roses
the
fair
wavy
cloud
that
fled
in
the
morning
now
comes
to
his
sight
once
more
comes
blushing
yet
still
comes
on
comes
burning
with
blushes
yet
hastens
and
clings
to
his
side
then
arrives
your
time
for
resting
the
world
about
you
is
all
your
own
and
there
where
you
will
you
pitch
your
solitary
tent
there
is
no
living
thing
to
dispute
your
choice
when
at
last
the
spot
had
been
fixed
upon
and
we
came
to
a
halt
one
of
the
arabs
would
touch
the
chest
of
my
camel
and
utter
at
the
same
time
a
peculiar
gurgling
sound
the
beast
instantly
understood
and
obeyed
the
sign
and
slowly
sunk
under
me
till
she
brought
her
body
to
a
level
with
the
ground
then
gladly
enough
i
alighted
the
rest
of
the
camels
were
unloaded
and
turned
loose
to
browse
upon
the
shrubs
of
the
desert
where
shrubs
there
were
or
where
these
failed
to
wait
for
the
small
quantity
of
food
that
was
allowed
them
out
of
our
stores
my
servants
helped
by
the
arabs
busied
themselves
in
pitching
the
tent
and
kindling
the
fire
whilst
this
was
doing
i
used
to
walk
away
towards
the
east
confiding
in
the
print
of
my
foot
as
a
guide
for
my
return
apart
from
the
cheering
voices
of
my
attendants
i
could
better
know
and
feel
the
loneliness
of
the
desert
the
influence
of
such
scenes
however
was
not
of
a
softening
kind
but
filled
me
rather
with
a
sort
of
childish
exultation
in
the
which
enabled
me
to
stand
thus
alone
in
the
wideness
of
shortlived
pride
for
wherever
man
wanders
he
still
remains
tethered
by
the
chain
that
links
him
to
his
kind
and
so
when
the
night
closed
around
me
i
began
to
return
to
return
as
it
were
to
my
own
gate
reaching
at
last
some
high
ground
i
could
see
and
see
with
delight
the
fire
of
our
small
encampment
and
when
at
last
i
regained
the
spot
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
home
that
had
sprung
up
for
me
in
the
midst
of
these
solitudes
my
arabs
were
busy
with
their
bread
mysseri
rattling
teacups
the
little
kettle
with
her
odd
looks
sat
humming
away
old
songs
about
england
and
two
or
three
yards
from
the
fire
my
tent
stood
prim
and
tight
with
open
portal
and
with
welcoming
look
like
the
old
of
our
lyrist
s
sweet
lady
at
the
beginning
of
my
journey
the
night
breeze
blew
coldly
when
that
happened
the
dry
sand
was
heaped
up
outside
round
the
skirts
of
the
tent
and
so
the
wind
that
everywhere
else
could
sweep
as
he
listed
along
those
dreary
plains
was
forced
to
turn
aside
in
his
course
and
make
way
as
he
ought
for
the
englishman
then
within
my
tent
there
were
heaps
of
libraries
bedrooms
oratories
all
crowded
into
the
space
of
a
hearthrug
the
first
night
i
remember
with
my
books
and
maps
about
me
i
wanted
light
they
brought
me
a
taper
and
immediately
from
out
of
the
silent
desert
there
rushed
in
a
flood
of
life
unseen
before
monsters
of
moths
of
all
shapes
and
hues
that
never
before
perhaps
had
looked
upon
the
shining
of
a
flame
now
madly
thronged
into
my
tent
and
dashed
through
the
fire
of
the
candle
till
they
fairly
extinguished
it
with
their
burning
limbs
those
who
had
failed
in
attaining
this
martyrdom
suddenly
became
serious
and
clung
despondingly
to
the
canvas
by
and
by
there
was
brought
to
me
the
fragrant
tea
and
big
masses
of
scorched
and
scorching
toast
and
the
butter
that
had
come
all
the
way
to
me
in
this
desert
of
asia
from
out
of
that
poor
dear
starving
ireland
i
feasted
like
a
king
like
four
kings
like
a
boy
in
the
fourth
form
when
the
cold
sullen
morning
dawned
and
my
people
began
to
load
the
camels
i
always
felt
loath
to
give
back
to
the
waste
this
little
spot
of
ground
that
had
glowed
for
a
while
with
the
cheerfulness
of
a
human
dwelling
one
by
one
the
cloaks
the
saddles
the
baggage
the
hundred
things
that
strewed
the
ground
and
made
it
look
so
these
were
taken
away
and
laid
upon
the
camels
a
speck
in
the
broad
tracts
of
asia
remained
still
impressed
with
the
mark
of
patent
portmanteaus
and
the
heels
of
london
boots
the
embers
of
the
fire
lay
black
and
cold
upon
the
sand
and
these
were
the
signs
we
left
my
tent
was
spared
to
the
last
but
when
all
else
was
ready
for
the
start
then
came
its
fall
the
pegs
were
drawn
the
canvas
shivered
and
in
less
than
a
minute
there
was
nothing
that
remained
of
my
genial
home
but
only
a
pole
and
a
bundle
the
encroaching
englishman
was
off
and
instant
upon
the
fall
of
the
canvas
like
an
owner
who
had
waited
and
watched
the
genius
of
the
desert
stalked
in
to
servants
as
i
suppose
of
any
other
europeans
not
much
accustomed
to
amuse
themselves
by
fancy
or
memory
it
often
happens
that
after
a
few
days
journeying
the
loneliness
of
the
desert
will
become
frightfully
oppressive
upon
my
poor
fellows
the
access
of
melancholy
came
heavy
and
all
at
once
as
a
blow
from
above
they
bent
their
necks
and
bore
it
as
best
they
could
but
their
joy
was
great
on
the
fifth
day
when
we
came
to
an
oasis
called
gatieh
for
here
we
found
encamped
a
caravan
that
is
an
assemblage
of
travellers
from
cairo
the
orientals
living
in
cities
never
pass
the
desert
except
in
this
way
many
will
wait
for
weeks
and
even
for
months
until
a
sufficient
number
of
persons
can
be
found
ready
to
undertake
the
journey
at
the
same
the
flock
of
sheep
is
big
enough
to
fancy
itself
a
match
for
wolves
they
could
not
i
think
really
secure
themselves
against
any
serious
danger
by
this
contrivance
for
though
they
have
arms
they
are
so
little
accustomed
to
use
them
and
so
utterly
unorganised
that
they
never
could
make
good
their
resistance
to
robbers
of
the
slightest
respectability
it
is
not
of
the
bedouins
that
such
travellers
are
afraid
for
the
safe
conduct
granted
by
the
chief
of
the
ruling
tribe
is
never
i
believe
violated
but
it
is
said
that
there
are
deserters
and
scamps
of
various
sorts
who
hover
about
the
skirts
of
the
desert
particularly
on
the
cairo
side
and
are
anxious
to
succeed
to
the
property
of
any
poor
devils
whom
they
may
find
more
weak
and
defenceless
than
themselves
these
people
from
cairo
professed
to
be
amazed
at
the
ludicrous
disproportion
between
their
numerical
forces
and
mine
they
could
not
understand
and
they
wanted
to
know
by
what
strange
privilege
it
is
that
an
englishman
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
a
couple
of
servants
rides
safely
across
the
desert
whilst
they
the
natives
of
the
neighbouring
cities
are
forced
to
travel
in
troops
or
rather
in
herds
one
of
them
got
a
few
minutes
of
private
conversation
with
dthemetri
and
ventured
to
ask
him
anxiously
whether
the
english
did
not
travel
under
the
protection
of
evil
demons
i
had
previously
known
from
methley
i
think
who
had
travelled
in
persia
that
this
notion
so
conducive
to
the
safety
of
our
countrymen
is
generally
prevalent
amongst
orientals
it
owes
its
origin
partly
to
the
strong
wilfulness
of
the
english
gentleman
which
not
being
backed
by
any
visible
authority
either
civil
or
military
seems
perfectly
superhuman
to
the
soft
asiatic
but
partly
too
to
the
magic
of
the
banking
system
by
force
of
which
the
wealthy
traveller
will
make
all
his
journeys
without
carrying
a
handful
of
coin
and
yet
when
he
arrives
at
a
city
will
rain
down
showers
of
gold
the
theory
is
that
the
english
traveller
has
committed
some
sin
against
god
and
his
conscience
and
that
for
this
the
evil
spirit
has
hold
of
him
and
drives
him
from
his
home
like
a
victim
of
the
old
grecian
furies
and
forces
him
to
travel
over
countries
far
and
strange
and
most
chiefly
over
deserts
and
desolate
places
and
to
stand
upon
the
sites
of
cities
that
once
were
and
are
now
no
more
and
to
grope
among
the
tombs
of
dead
men
often
enough
there
is
something
of
truth
in
this
notion
often
enough
the
wandering
englishman
is
guilty
if
guilt
it
be
of
some
pride
or
ambition
big
or
small
imperial
or
parochial
which
being
offended
has
made
the
lone
place
more
tolerable
than
ballrooms
to
him
a
sinner
i
can
understand
the
sort
of
amazement
of
the
orientals
at
the
scantiness
of
the
retinue
with
which
an
englishman
passes
the
desert
for
i
was
somewhat
struck
myself
when
i
saw
one
of
my
countrymen
making
his
way
across
the
wilderness
in
this
simple
style
at
first
there
was
a
mere
moving
speck
on
the
horizon
my
party
of
course
became
all
alive
with
excitement
and
there
were
many
surmises
soon
it
appeared
that
three
laden
camels
were
approaching
and
that
two
of
them
carried
riders
in
a
little
while
we
saw
that
one
of
the
riders
wore
european
dress
and
at
last
the
travellers
were
pronounced
to
be
an
english
gentleman
and
his
servant
by
their
side
there
were
a
couple
i
think
of
arabs
on
foot
and
this
was
the
whole
party
you
you
love
sailing
in
returning
from
a
cruise
to
the
english
coast
you
see
often
enough
a
fisherman
s
humble
boat
far
away
from
all
shores
with
an
ugly
black
sky
above
and
an
angry
sea
beneath
you
watch
the
grizzly
old
man
at
the
helm
carrying
his
craft
with
strange
skill
through
the
turmoil
of
waters
and
the
boy
yet
already
and
with
steady
eyes
that
look
through
the
blast
you
see
him
understanding
commandments
from
the
jerk
of
his
father
s
white
eyebrow
now
belaying
and
now
letting
go
now
scrunching
himself
down
into
mere
ballast
or
baling
out
death
with
a
pipkin
stale
enough
is
the
sight
and
yet
when
i
see
it
i
always
stare
anew
and
with
a
kind
of
titanic
exultation
because
that
a
poor
boat
with
the
brain
of
a
man
and
the
hands
of
a
boy
on
board
can
match
herself
so
bravely
against
black
heaven
and
ocean
well
so
when
you
have
travelled
for
days
and
days
over
an
eastern
desert
without
meeting
the
likeness
of
a
human
being
and
then
at
last
see
an
english
and
his
servant
come
listlessly
slouching
along
from
out
of
the
forward
horizon
you
stare
at
the
wide
unproportion
between
this
slender
company
and
the
boundless
plains
of
sand
through
which
they
are
keeping
their
way
this
englishman
as
i
afterwards
found
was
a
military
man
returning
to
his
country
from
india
and
crossing
the
desert
at
this
part
in
order
to
go
through
palestine
as
for
me
i
had
come
pretty
straight
from
england
and
so
here
we
met
in
the
wilderness
at
about
from
our
respective
as
we
approached
each
other
it
became
with
me
a
question
whether
we
should
speak
i
thought
it
likely
that
the
stranger
would
accost
me
and
in
the
event
of
his
doing
so
i
was
quite
ready
to
be
as
sociable
and
chatty
as
i
could
be
according
to
my
nature
but
still
i
could
not
think
of
anything
particular
that
i
had
to
say
to
him
of
course
among
civilised
people
the
not
having
anything
to
say
is
no
excuse
at
all
for
not
speaking
but
i
was
shy
and
indolent
and
i
felt
no
great
wish
to
stop
and
talk
like
a
morning
visitor
in
the
midst
of
those
broad
solitudes
the
traveller
perhaps
felt
as
i
did
for
except
that
we
lifted
our
hands
to
our
caps
and
waved
our
arms
in
courtesy
we
passed
each
other
as
if
we
had
passed
in
bond
street
our
attendants
however
were
not
to
be
cheated
of
the
delight
that
they
felt
in
speaking
to
new
listeners
and
hearing
fresh
voices
once
more
the
masters
therefore
had
no
sooner
passed
each
other
than
their
respective
servants
quietly
stopped
and
entered
into
conversation
as
soon
as
my
camel
found
that
her
companions
were
not
following
her
she
caught
the
social
feeling
and
refused
to
go
on
i
felt
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
and
determined
to
accost
the
stranger
if
only
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
of
remaining
stuck
fast
in
the
desert
whilst
our
servants
were
amusing
themselves
when
with
this
intent
i
turned
round
my
camel
i
found
that
the
gallant
officer
who
had
passed
me
by
about
thirty
or
forty
yards
was
exactly
in
the
same
predicament
as
myself
i
put
my
now
willing
camel
in
motion
and
rode
up
towards
the
stranger
who
seeing
this
followed
my
example
and
came
forward
to
meet
me
he
was
the
first
to
speak
he
was
much
too
courteous
to
address
me
as
if
he
admitted
the
possibility
of
my
wishing
to
accost
him
from
any
feeling
of
mere
sociability
or
love
of
vain
talk
on
the
contrary
he
at
once
attributed
my
advances
to
a
laudable
wish
of
acquiring
statistical
information
and
accordingly
when
we
got
within
speaking
distance
he
said
i
daresay
you
wish
to
know
how
the
plague
is
going
on
at
cairo
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
he
regretted
that
his
information
did
not
enable
him
to
give
me
in
numbers
a
perfectly
accurate
statement
of
the
daily
deaths
he
afterwards
talked
pleasantly
enough
upon
other
and
less
ghastly
subjects
i
thought
him
manly
and
intelligent
a
worthy
one
of
the
few
thousand
strong
englishmen
to
whom
the
empire
of
india
is
committed
the
night
after
the
meeting
with
the
people
of
the
caravan
dthemetri
alarmed
by
their
warnings
took
upon
himself
to
keep
watch
all
night
in
the
tent
no
robbers
came
except
a
jackal
that
poked
his
nose
into
my
tent
from
some
motive
of
rational
curiosity
dthemetri
did
not
shoot
him
for
fear
of
waking
me
these
brutes
swarm
in
every
part
of
syria
and
there
were
many
of
them
even
in
the
midst
of
the
void
sands
that
would
seem
to
give
such
poor
promise
of
food
i
can
hardly
tell
what
prey
they
could
be
hoping
for
unless
it
were
that
they
might
find
now
and
then
the
carcass
of
some
camel
that
had
died
on
the
journey
they
do
not
marshal
themselves
into
great
packs
like
the
wild
dogs
of
eastern
cities
but
follow
their
prey
in
families
like
the
of
europe
their
voices
are
frightfully
like
to
the
shouts
and
cries
of
human
beings
if
you
lie
awake
in
your
tent
at
night
you
are
almost
continually
hearing
some
hungry
family
as
it
sweeps
along
in
full
cry
you
hear
the
exulting
scream
with
which
the
sagacious
dam
first
winds
the
carrion
and
the
shrill
response
of
the
unanimous
cubs
as
they
sniff
the
tainted
air
wha
wha
wha
wha
wha
wha
whose
gift
is
it
in
mamma
once
during
this
passage
my
arabs
lost
their
way
among
the
hills
of
loose
sand
that
surrounded
us
but
after
a
while
we
were
lucky
enough
to
recover
our
right
line
of
march
the
same
day
we
fell
in
with
a
sheik
the
head
of
a
family
that
actually
dwells
at
no
great
distance
from
this
part
of
the
desert
during
nine
months
of
the
year
the
man
carried
a
matchlock
of
which
he
was
very
proud
we
stopped
and
sat
down
and
rested
a
while
for
the
sake
of
a
little
talk
there
was
much
that
i
should
have
liked
to
ask
this
man
but
he
could
not
understand
dthemetri
s
language
and
the
process
of
getting
at
his
knowledge
by
double
interpretation
through
my
arabs
was
unsatisfactory
i
discovered
however
and
my
arabs
knew
of
that
fact
that
this
man
and
his
family
lived
habitually
for
nine
months
of
the
year
without
touching
or
seeing
either
bread
or
water
the
stunted
shrub
growing
at
intervals
through
the
sand
in
this
part
of
the
desert
enables
the
camel
mares
to
yield
a
little
milk
which
furnishes
the
sole
food
and
drink
of
their
owner
and
his
people
during
the
other
three
months
the
hottest
of
the
months
i
suppose
even
this
resource
fails
and
then
the
sheik
and
his
people
are
forced
to
pass
into
another
district
you
would
ask
me
why
the
man
should
not
remain
always
in
that
district
which
supplies
him
with
water
during
three
months
of
the
year
but
i
don
t
know
enough
of
arab
politics
to
answer
the
question
the
sheik
was
not
a
good
specimen
of
the
effect
produced
by
the
diet
to
which
he
is
subjected
he
was
very
small
very
spare
and
sadly
shrivelled
a
poor
snipe
a
mere
cinder
of
a
man
i
made
him
sit
down
by
my
side
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
from
out
of
my
goatskins
this
was
not
very
tempting
drink
to
look
at
for
it
had
become
turbid
and
was
deeply
reddened
by
some
colouring
matter
contained
in
the
skins
but
it
kept
its
sweetness
and
tasted
like
a
strong
decoction
of
russia
leather
the
sheik
sipped
this
drop
by
drop
with
ineffable
relish
and
rolled
his
eyes
solemnly
round
between
every
draught
as
though
the
drink
were
the
drink
of
the
prophet
and
had
come
from
the
seventh
heaven
an
inquiry
about
distances
led
to
the
discovery
that
this
sheik
had
never
heard
of
the
division
of
time
into
hours
my
arabs
themselves
i
think
were
rather
surprised
at
this
about
this
part
of
my
journey
i
saw
the
likeness
of
a
lake
i
saw
as
it
seemed
a
broad
sheet
of
calm
water
that
stretched
far
and
fair
towards
the
south
stretching
deep
into
winding
creeks
and
hemmed
in
by
jutting
promontories
and
shelving
smooth
off
towards
the
shallow
side
on
its
bosom
the
reflected
fire
of
the
sun
lay
playing
and
seeming
to
float
upon
waters
deep
and
still
though
i
knew
of
the
cheat
it
was
not
till
the
spongy
foot
of
my
camel
had
almost
trodden
in
the
seeming
waters
that
i
could
undeceive
my
eyes
for
the
was
quite
true
and
natural
i
soon
saw
the
cause
of
the
phantasm
a
sheet
of
water
heavily
impregnated
with
salts
had
filled
this
great
hollow
and
when
dried
up
by
evaporation
had
left
a
white
saline
deposit
that
exactly
marked
the
space
which
the
waters
had
covered
and
thus
sketched
a
good
the
minute
crystals
of
the
salt
sparkled
in
the
sun
and
so
looked
like
the
face
of
a
lake
that
is
calm
and
smooth
the
pace
of
the
camel
is
irksome
and
makes
your
shoulders
and
loins
ache
from
the
peculiar
way
in
which
you
are
obliged
to
suit
yourself
to
the
movements
of
the
beast
but
you
soon
of
course
become
inured
to
this
and
after
the
first
two
days
this
way
of
travelling
became
so
familiar
to
me
that
poor
sleeper
as
i
am
i
now
and
then
slumbered
for
some
moments
together
on
the
back
of
my
camel
on
the
fifth
day
of
my
journey
the
air
above
lay
dead
and
all
the
whole
earth
that
i
could
reach
with
my
utmost
sight
and
keenest
listening
was
still
and
lifeless
as
some
dispeopled
and
forgotten
world
that
rolls
round
and
round
in
the
heavens
through
wasted
floods
of
light
the
sun
growing
fiercer
and
fiercer
shone
down
more
mightily
now
than
ever
on
me
he
shone
before
and
as
i
dropped
my
head
under
his
fire
and
closed
my
eyes
against
the
glare
that
surrounded
me
i
slowly
fell
asleep
for
how
many
minutes
or
moments
i
can
not
tell
but
after
a
while
i
was
gently
awakened
by
a
peal
of
church
bells
my
native
bells
the
innocent
bells
of
marlen
that
never
before
sent
forth
their
music
beyond
the
blaygon
hills
my
first
idea
naturally
was
that
i
still
remained
fast
under
the
power
of
a
dream
i
roused
myself
and
drew
aside
the
silk
that
covered
my
eyes
and
plunged
my
bare
face
into
the
light
then
at
least
i
was
well
enough
wakened
but
still
those
old
marlen
bells
rung
on
not
ringing
for
joy
but
properly
prosily
steadily
merrily
ringing
for
after
a
while
the
sound
died
away
slowly
it
happened
that
neither
i
nor
any
of
my
party
had
a
watch
by
which
to
measure
the
exact
time
of
its
lasting
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
about
ten
minutes
had
passed
before
the
bells
ceased
i
attributed
the
effect
to
the
great
heat
of
the
sun
the
perfect
dryness
of
the
clear
air
through
which
i
moved
and
the
deep
stillness
of
all
around
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
causes
by
occasioning
a
great
tension
and
consequent
susceptibility
of
the
hearing
organs
had
rendered
them
liable
to
tingle
under
the
passing
touch
of
some
mere
memory
that
must
have
swept
across
my
brain
in
a
moment
of
sleep
since
my
return
to
england
it
has
been
told
me
that
like
sounds
have
been
heard
at
sea
and
that
the
sailor
becalmed
under
a
vertical
sun
in
the
midst
of
the
wide
ocean
has
listened
in
trembling
wonder
to
the
chime
of
his
own
village
bells
at
this
time
i
kept
a
poor
shabby
pretence
of
a
journal
which
just
enabled
me
to
know
the
day
of
the
month
and
the
week
according
to
the
european
calendar
and
when
in
my
tent
at
night
i
got
out
my
i
found
that
the
day
was
sunday
and
roughly
allowing
for
the
difference
of
time
in
this
longitude
i
concluded
that
at
the
moment
of
my
hearing
that
strange
peal
the
bells
of
marlen
must
have
been
actually
calling
the
prim
congregation
of
the
parish
to
morning
prayer
the
coincidence
amused
me
faintly
but
i
could
not
pluck
up
the
least
hope
that
the
effect
which
i
had
experienced
was
anything
other
than
an
illusion
an
illusion
liable
to
be
explained
as
every
illusion
is
in
these
days
by
some
of
the
philosophers
who
guess
at
nature
s
riddles
it
would
have
been
sweeter
to
believe
that
my
kneeling
mother
by
some
pious
enchantment
had
asked
and
found
this
spell
to
rouse
me
from
my
scandalous
forgetfulness
of
god
s
holy
day
but
my
fancy
was
too
weak
to
carry
a
faith
like
that
indeed
the
vale
through
which
the
bells
of
marlen
send
their
song
is
a
highly
respectable
vale
and
its
people
save
one
two
or
three
are
wholly
unaddicted
to
the
practice
of
magical
arts
after
the
fifth
day
of
my
journey
i
no
longer
travelled
over
shifting
hills
but
came
upon
a
dead
level
a
dead
level
bed
of
sand
quite
hard
and
studded
with
small
shining
pebbles
the
heat
grew
fierce
there
was
no
valley
nor
hollow
no
hill
no
mound
no
shadow
of
hill
nor
of
mound
by
which
i
could
mark
the
way
i
was
making
hour
by
hour
i
advanced
and
saw
no
was
still
the
very
centre
of
a
round
horizon
hour
by
hour
i
advanced
and
still
there
was
the
same
and
the
same
and
the
same
circle
of
flaming
same
circle
of
sand
still
glaring
with
light
and
fire
over
all
the
heaven
above
over
all
the
earth
beneath
there
was
no
visible
power
that
could
balk
the
fierce
will
of
the
sun
he
rejoiced
as
a
strong
man
to
run
a
race
his
going
forth
was
from
the
end
of
the
heaven
and
his
circuit
unto
the
ends
of
it
and
there
was
nothing
hid
from
the
heat
from
pole
to
pole
and
from
the
east
to
the
west
he
brandished
his
fiery
sceptre
as
though
he
had
usurped
all
heaven
and
earth
as
he
bid
the
soft
persian
in
ancient
times
so
now
and
fiercely
too
he
bid
me
bow
down
and
worship
him
so
now
in
his
pride
he
seemed
to
command
me
and
say
thou
shalt
have
none
other
gods
but
i
was
all
alone
before
him
there
were
these
two
pitted
together
and
face
to
mighty
sun
for
one
and
for
the
other
this
poor
pale
solitary
self
of
mine
that
i
always
carry
about
with
me
but
on
the
eighth
day
and
before
i
had
yet
turned
away
from
jehovah
for
the
glittering
god
of
the
persians
there
appeared
a
dark
line
upon
the
edge
of
the
forward
horizon
and
soon
the
line
deepened
into
a
delicate
fringe
that
sparkled
here
and
there
as
though
it
were
sewn
with
diamonds
there
then
before
me
were
the
gardens
and
the
minarets
of
egypt
and
the
mighty
works
of
the
nile
and
i
the
eternal
ego
that
i
am
had
lived
to
see
and
i
saw
them
when
evening
came
i
was
still
within
the
confines
of
the
desert
and
my
tent
was
pitched
as
usual
but
one
of
my
arabs
stalked
away
rapidly
towards
the
west
without
telling
me
of
the
errand
on
which
he
was
bent
after
a
while
he
returned
he
had
toiled
on
a
graceful
service
he
had
travelled
all
the
way
on
to
the
border
of
the
living
world
and
brought
me
back
for
token
an
ear
of
rice
full
fresh
and
green
the
next
day
i
entered
upon
egypt
and
floated
along
for
the
delight
was
as
the
delight
of
bathing
through
green
wavy
fields
of
rice
and
pastures
fresh
and
plentiful
and
dived
into
the
cold
verdure
of
groves
and
gardens
and
quenched
my
hot
eyes
in
shade
as
though
in
deep
rushing
waters
chapter
xviii
cairo
and
the
plague
cairo
and
plague
during
the
whole
time
of
my
stay
the
plague
was
so
master
of
the
city
and
showed
itself
so
staringly
in
every
street
and
every
alley
that
i
can
t
now
affect
to
dissociate
the
two
ideas
when
coming
from
the
desert
i
rode
through
a
village
which
lies
near
to
the
city
on
the
eastern
side
there
approached
me
with
busy
face
and
earnest
gestures
a
personage
in
the
turkish
dress
his
long
flowing
beard
gave
him
rather
a
majestic
look
but
his
briskness
of
manner
and
his
visible
anxiety
to
accost
me
seemed
strange
in
an
oriental
the
man
in
fact
was
french
or
of
french
origin
and
his
object
was
to
warn
me
of
the
plague
and
prevent
me
from
entering
the
city

vous
en

je

mais
monsieur
je

donc

avertir
tout
bonnement

si
vous
entrez

je

the
frenchman
was
at
last
convinced
that
it
was
vain
to
reason
with
a
mere
englishman
who
could
not
understand
what
it
was
to
be
i
thanked
him
most
sincerely
for
his
kindly
meant
warning
in
hot
countries
it
is
very
unusual
indeed
for
a
man
to
go
out
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
give
free
advice
to
a
stranger
when
i
arrived
at
cairo
i
summoned
osman
effendi
who
was
as
i
knew
the
owner
of
several
houses
and
would
be
able
to
provide
me
with
apartments
he
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
this
for
there
was
not
one
european
traveller
in
cairo
besides
myself
poor
osman
he
met
me
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
for
the
fear
of
the
plague
sat
heavily
on
his
soul
he
seemed
as
if
he
felt
that
he
was
doing
wrong
in
lending
me
a
and
he
betrayed
such
a
listlessness
about
temporal
matters
as
one
might
look
for
in
a
man
who
believed
that
his
days
were
numbered
he
caught
me
too
soon
after
my
arrival
coming
out
from
the
public
baths
and
from
that
time
forward
he
was
sadly
afraid
of
me
for
he
shared
the
opinions
of
europeans
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
contagion
osman
s
history
is
a
curious
one
he
was
a
scotchman
born
and
when
very
young
being
then
a
he
landed
in
egypt
with
fraser
s
force
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
according
to
mahometan
custom
the
alternative
of
death
or
the
koran
was
offered
to
him
he
did
not
choose
death
and
therefore
went
through
the
ceremonies
which
were
necessary
for
turning
him
into
a
good
mahometan
but
what
amused
me
most
in
his
history
was
this
that
very
soon
after
having
embraced
islam
he
was
obliged
in
practice
to
become
curious
and
discriminating
in
his
new
faith
to
make
war
upon
mahometan
dissenters
and
follow
the
orthodox
standard
of
the
prophet
in
fierce
campaigns
against
the
wahabees
who
are
the
unitarians
of
the
mussulman
world
the
wahabees
were
crushed
and
osman
returning
home
in
triumph
from
his
holy
wars
began
to
flourish
in
the
world
he
acquired
property
and
became
or
gentleman
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
cairo
he
seemed
to
be
much
respected
by
his
brother
mahometans
and
gave
pledge
of
his
sincere
alienation
from
christianity
by
keeping
a
couple
of
wives
he
affected
the
same
sort
of
reserve
in
mentioning
them
as
is
generally
shown
by
orientals
he
invited
me
indeed
to
see
his
harem
but
he
made
both
his
wives
bundle
out
before
i
was
admitted
he
felt
as
it
seemed
to
me
that
neither
of
them
would
bear
criticism
and
i
think
that
this
idea
rather
than
any
motive
of
sincere
jealousy
induced
him
to
keep
them
out
of
sight
the
rooms
of
the
harem
reminded
me
of
an
english
nursery
rather
than
of
a
mahometan
paradise
one
is
apt
to
judge
of
a
woman
before
one
sees
her
by
the
air
of
elegance
or
coarseness
with
which
she
surrounds
her
home
i
judged
osman
s
wives
by
this
test
and
condemned
them
both
but
the
strangest
feature
in
osman
s
character
was
his
inextinguishable
nationality
in
vain
they
had
brought
him
over
the
seas
in
early
boyhood
in
vain
had
he
suffered
captivity
conversion
circumcision
in
vain
they
had
passed
him
through
fire
in
their
arabian
campaigns
they
could
not
cut
away
or
burn
out
poor
osman
s
inborn
love
of
all
that
was
scotch
in
vain
men
called
him
effendi
in
vain
he
swept
along
in
eastern
robes
in
vain
the
rival
wives
adorned
his
harem
the
joy
of
his
heart
still
plainly
lay
in
this
that
he
had
three
shelves
of
books
and
that
the
books
were
thoroughbred
edinburgh
this
the
edinburgh
that
and
above
all
i
recollect
he
prided
himself
upon
the
edinburgh
cabinet
the
fear
of
the
plague
is
its
forerunner
it
is
likely
enough
that
at
the
time
of
my
seeing
poor
osman
the
deadly
taint
was
beginning
to
creep
through
his
veins
but
it
was
not
till
after
i
had
left
cairo
that
he
was
visibly
stricken
he
died
as
soon
as
i
had
seen
all
that
i
wanted
to
see
in
cairo
and
in
the
neighbourhood
i
wished
to
make
my
escape
from
a
city
that
lay
under
the
terrible
curse
of
the
plague
but
mysseri
fell
ill
in
consequence
i
believe
of
the
hardships
which
he
had
been
suffering
in
my
service
after
a
while
he
recovered
sufficiently
to
undertake
a
journey
but
then
there
was
some
difficulty
in
procuring
beasts
of
burthen
and
it
was
not
till
the
nineteenth
day
of
my
sojourn
that
i
quitted
the
city
during
all
this
time
the
power
of
the
plague
was
rapidly
increasing
when
i
first
arrived
it
was
said
that
the
daily
number
of
accidents
by
plague
out
of
a
population
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
did
not
exceed
four
or
five
hundred
but
before
i
went
away
the
deaths
were
reckoned
at
twelve
hundred
a
day
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
the
numbers
given
out
as
i
believe
they
were
by
officials
were
at
all
correct
but
i
could
not
help
knowing
that
from
day
to
day
the
number
of
the
dead
was
increasing
my
quarters
were
in
a
street
which
was
one
of
the
chief
thoroughfares
of
the
city
the
funerals
in
cairo
take
place
between
daybreak
and
noon
and
as
i
was
generally
in
my
rooms
during
this
part
of
the
day
i
could
form
some
opinion
as
to
the
briskness
of
the
plague
i
don
t
mean
this
for
a
sly
insinuation
that
i
got
up
every
morning
with
the
sun
it
was
not
so
but
the
funerals
of
most
people
in
decent
circumstances
at
cairo
are
attended
by
singers
and
howlers
and
the
performances
of
these
people
woke
me
in
the
early
morning
and
prevented
me
from
remaining
in
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
below
these
funerals
were
very
simply
conducted
the
bier
was
a
shallow
wooden
tray
carried
upon
a
light
and
weak
wooden
frame
the
tray
had
in
general
no
lid
but
the
body
was
more
or
less
hidden
from
view
by
a
shawl
or
scarf
the
whole
was
borne
upon
the
shoulders
of
men
who
contrived
to
cut
along
with
their
burthen
at
a
great
pace
two
or
three
singers
generally
preceded
the
bier
the
howlers
who
are
paid
for
their
vocal
labours
followed
after
and
last
of
all
came
such
of
the
dead
man
s
friends
and
relations
as
could
keep
up
with
such
a
rapid
procession
these
especially
the
women
would
get
terribly
blown
and
would
straggle
back
into
the
rear
many
were
fairly
beaten
i
never
observed
any
appearance
of
mourning
in
the
mourners
the
pace
was
too
severe
for
any
solemn
affectation
of
grief
when
first
i
arrived
at
cairo
the
funerals
that
daily
passed
under
my
windows
were
many
but
still
there
were
frequent
and
long
intervals
without
a
single
howl
every
day
however
except
one
when
i
fancied
that
i
observed
a
diminution
of
funerals
these
intervals
became
less
frequent
and
shorter
and
at
last
the
passing
of
the
howlers
from
morn
till
noon
was
almost
incessant
i
believe
that
about
of
the
whole
people
was
carried
off
by
this
visitation
the
orientals
however
have
more
quiet
fortitude
than
europeans
under
afflictions
of
this
sort
and
they
never
allow
the
plague
to
interfere
with
their
religious
usages
i
rode
one
day
round
the
great
the
tombs
are
strewed
over
a
great
expanse
among
the
vast
mountains
of
rubbish
the
accumulations
of
many
centuries
which
surround
the
city
the
ground
unlike
the
turkish
cities
of
the
dead
which
are
made
so
beautiful
by
their
dark
cypresses
has
nothing
to
sweeten
melancholy
nothing
to
mitigate
the
odiousness
of
death
carnivorous
beasts
and
birds
possess
the
place
by
night
and
now
in
the
fair
morning
it
was
all
alive
with
fresh
with
dead
yet
at
this
very
time
when
the
plague
was
raging
so
furiously
and
on
this
very
ground
which
resounded
so
mournfully
with
the
howls
of
arriving
funerals
preparations
were
going
on
for
the
religious
festival
called
the
kourban
bairam
tents
were
pitched
and
hung
for
the
amusement
of
ghastly
holiday
but
the
mahometans
take
a
pride
and
a
just
pride
in
following
their
ancient
customs
undisturbed
by
the
shadow
of
death
i
did
not
hear
whilst
i
was
at
cairo
that
any
prayer
for
a
remission
of
the
plague
had
been
offered
up
in
the
mosques
i
believe
that
however
frightful
the
ravages
of
the
disease
may
be
the
mahometans
refrain
from
approaching
heaven
with
their
complaints
until
the
plague
has
endured
for
a
long
space
and
then
at
last
they
pray
god
not
that
the
plague
may
cease
but
that
it
may
go
to
another
city
a
good
mussulman
seems
to
take
pride
in
repudiating
the
european
notion
that
the
will
of
god
can
be
eluded
by
eluding
the
touch
of
a
sleeve
when
i
went
to
see
the
pyramids
of
sakkara
i
was
the
guest
of
a
noble
old
fellow
an
osmanlee
whose
soft
rolling
language
it
was
a
luxury
to
hear
after
suffering
as
i
had
suffered
of
late
from
the
shrieking
tongue
of
the
arabs
this
man
was
aware
of
the
european
ideas
about
contagion
and
his
first
care
therefore
was
to
assure
me
that
not
a
single
instance
of
plague
had
occurred
in
his
village
he
then
inquired
as
to
the
progress
of
the
plague
at
cairo
i
had
but
a
bad
account
to
give
up
to
this
time
my
host
had
carefully
refrained
from
touching
me
out
of
respect
to
the
european
theory
of
contagion
but
as
soon
as
it
was
made
plain
that
he
and
not
i
would
be
the
person
endangered
by
contact
he
gently
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
in
order
to
make
me
feel
sure
that
the
circumstance
of
my
coming
from
an
infected
city
did
not
occasion
him
the
least
uneasiness
in
that
touch
there
was
true
hospitality
very
different
is
the
faith
and
the
practice
of
the
europeans
or
rather
i
mean
of
the
europeans
settled
in
the
east
and
commonly
called
levantines
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
my
journey
over
the
desert
i
had
been
so
long
alone
that
the
prospect
of
speaking
to
somebody
at
cairo
seemed
almost
a
new
excitement
i
felt
a
sort
of
consciousness
that
i
had
a
little
of
the
wild
beast
about
me
but
i
was
quite
in
the
humour
to
be
charmingly
tame
and
to
be
quite
engaging
in
my
manners
if
i
should
have
an
opportunity
of
holding
communion
with
any
of
the
human
race
whilst
at
cairo
i
knew
no
one
in
the
place
and
had
no
letters
of
introduction
but
i
carried
letters
of
credit
and
it
often
happens
in
places
remote
from
england
that
those
advices
operate
as
a
sort
of
introduction
and
obtain
for
the
bearer
if
disposed
to
receive
them
such
ordinary
civilities
as
it
may
be
in
the
power
of
the
banker
to
offer
very
soon
after
my
arrival
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
levantine
to
whom
my
credentials
were
addressed
at
his
door
several
persons
all
arabs
were
hanging
about
and
keeping
guard
it
was
not
till
after
some
delay
and
the
passing
of
some
communications
with
those
in
the
interior
of
the
citadel
that
i
was
admitted
at
length
however
i
was
conducted
through
the
court
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
and
finally
into
the
apartment
where
business
was
transacted
the
room
was
divided
by
an
excellent
substantial
fence
of
iron
bars
and
behind
this
grille
the
banker
had
his
station
the
truth
was
that
from
fear
of
the
plague
he
had
adopted
the
course
usually
taken
by
european
residents
and
had
shut
himself
up
in
strict
quarantine
is
to
say
that
he
had
as
he
hoped
cut
himself
off
from
all
communication
with
infecting
substances
the
europeans
long
resident
in
the
east
without
any
or
with
scarcely
any
exception
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
plague
is
propagated
by
contact
and
by
contact
only
that
if
they
can
but
avoid
the
touch
of
an
infecting
substance
they
are
safe
and
that
if
they
can
not
they
die
this
belief
induces
them
to
adopt
the
contrivance
of
putting
themselves
in
that
state
of
siege
which
they
call
it
is
a
part
of
their
faith
that
metals
and
hempen
rope
and
also
i
fancy
one
or
two
other
substances
will
not
carry
the
infection
and
they
likewise
believe
that
the
germ
of
pestilence
which
lies
in
an
infected
substance
may
be
destroyed
by
submersion
in
water
or
by
the
action
of
smoke
they
therefore
guard
the
doors
of
their
houses
with
the
utmost
care
against
intrusion
and
condemn
themselves
with
all
the
members
of
their
family
including
any
european
servants
to
a
strict
imprisonment
within
the
walls
of
their
dwelling
their
native
attendants
are
not
allowed
to
enter
at
all
but
they
make
the
necessary
purchases
of
provisions
which
are
hauled
up
through
one
of
the
windows
by
means
of
a
rope
and
are
then
soaked
in
water
i
knew
nothing
of
these
mysteries
and
was
not
therefore
prepared
for
the
sort
of
reception
which
i
met
with
i
advanced
to
the
iron
fence
and
putting
my
letter
between
the
bars
politely
proffered
it
to
banker
banker
received
me
with
a
sad
and
dejected
look
and
not
with
open
arms
or
with
any
arms
at
all
but
pair
of
tongs
i
placed
my
letter
between
the
iron
fingers
which
picked
it
up
as
if
it
were
a
viper
and
conveyed
it
away
to
be
scorched
and
purified
by
fire
and
smoke
i
was
disgusted
at
this
reception
and
at
the
idea
that
anything
of
mine
could
carry
infection
to
the
poor
wretch
who
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
grille
pale
and
trembling
and
already
meet
for
death
i
looked
with
something
of
the
mahometan
s
feeling
upon
these
little
contrivances
for
eluding
fate
and
in
this
instance
at
least
they
were
vain
a
few
more
days
and
the
poor
who
had
striven
to
guard
the
days
of
his
life
as
though
they
were
coins
with
bolts
and
bars
of
was
seized
by
the
plague
and
he
died
to
people
entertaining
such
opinions
as
these
respecting
the
fatal
effect
of
contact
the
narrow
and
crowded
streets
of
cairo
were
terrible
as
the
easy
slope
that
leads
to
avernus
the
roaring
ocean
and
the
beetling
crags
owe
something
of
their
sublimity
to
if
they
be
tempted
they
can
take
the
warm
life
of
a
man
to
the
contagionist
filled
as
he
is
with
the
dread
of
final
causes
having
no
faith
in
destiny
nor
in
the
fixed
will
of
god
and
with
none
of
the
indifference
which
might
stand
him
instead
of
such
one
every
rag
that
shivers
in
the
breeze
of
a
city
has
this
sort
of
sublimity
if
by
any
terrible
ordinance
he
be
forced
to
venture
forth
he
sees
death
dangling
from
every
sleeve
and
as
he
creeps
forward
he
poises
his
shuddering
limbs
between
the
imminent
jacket
that
is
stabbing
at
his
right
elbow
and
the
murderous
pelisse
that
threatens
to
mow
him
clean
down
as
it
sweeps
along
on
his
left
but
most
of
all
he
dreads
that
which
most
of
all
he
should
touch
of
a
woman
s
dress
for
mothers
and
wives
hurrying
forth
on
kindly
errands
from
the
bedsides
of
the
dying
go
slouching
along
through
the
streets
more
wilfully
and
less
courteously
than
the
men
for
a
while
it
may
be
that
the
caution
of
the
poor
levantine
may
enable
him
to
avoid
contact
but
sooner
or
later
perhaps
the
dreaded
chance
arrives
that
bundle
of
linen
with
the
dark
tearful
eyes
at
the
top
of
it
that
labours
along
with
the
voluptuous
clumsiness
of
has
touched
the
poor
levantine
with
the
hem
of
her
sleeve
from
that
dread
moment
his
peace
is
gone
his
mind
for
ever
hanging
upon
the
fatal
touch
invites
the
blow
which
he
fears
he
watches
for
the
symptoms
of
plague
so
carefully
that
sooner
or
later
they
come
in
truth
the
parched
mouth
is
a
mouth
parched
the
throbbing
brain
throb
the
rapid
touches
his
own
wrist
for
he
dares
not
ask
counsel
of
any
man
lest
he
be
deserted
he
touches
his
wrist
and
feels
how
his
frighted
blood
goes
galloping
out
of
his
heart
there
is
nothing
but
the
fatal
swelling
that
is
wanting
to
make
his
sad
conviction
complete
immediately
he
has
an
odd
feel
under
the
pain
but
a
little
straining
of
the
skin
he
would
to
god
it
were
his
fancy
that
were
strong
enough
to
give
him
that
sensation
this
is
the
worst
of
all
it
now
seems
to
him
that
he
could
be
happy
and
contented
with
his
parched
mouth
and
his
throbbing
brain
and
his
rapid
pulse
if
only
he
could
know
that
there
were
no
swelling
under
the
left
arm
but
dare
he
try
a
moment
of
calmness
and
deliberation
he
dares
not
but
when
for
a
while
he
has
writhed
under
the
torture
of
suspense
a
sudden
strength
of
will
drives
him
to
seek
and
know
his
fate
he
touches
the
gland
and
finds
the
skin
sane
and
sound
but
under
the
cuticle
there
lies
a
small
lump
like
a
that
moves
as
he
pushes
it
oh
but
is
this
for
all
certainty
is
this
the
sentence
of
death
feel
the
gland
of
the
other
arm
there
is
not
the
same
lump
exactly
yet
something
a
little
like
it
have
not
some
people
glands
naturally
enlarged
to
heaven
he
were
one
so
he
does
for
himself
the
work
of
the
plague
and
when
the
angel
of
death
thus
courted
does
indeed
and
in
truth
come
he
has
only
to
finish
that
which
has
been
so
well
begun
he
passes
his
fiery
hand
over
the
brain
of
the
victim
and
lets
him
rave
for
a
season
but
all
of
people
and
things
once
dear
or
of
people
and
things
indifferent
once
more
the
poor
fellow
is
back
at
his
home
in
fair
provence
and
sees
the
that
stood
in
his
childhood
s
garden
sees
part
of
his
mother
and
the
face
of
that
little
dead
sister
he
sees
her
he
says
on
a
sunday
morning
for
all
the
church
bells
are
ringing
he
looks
up
and
down
through
the
universe
and
owns
it
well
piled
with
bales
upon
bales
of
cotton
and
cotton
much
so
that
he
feels
he
knows
he
swears
he
could
make
that
winning
hazard
if
the
billiard
table
would
not
slant
upwards
and
if
the
cue
were
a
cue
worth
playing
with
but
it
is
s
a
cue
that
won
t
own
arm
won
t
short
there
s
the
devil
to
pay
in
the
brain
of
the
poor
levantine
and
perhaps
the
next
night
but
one
he
becomes
the
life
and
the
soul
of
some
squalling
jackal
family
who
fish
him
out
by
the
foot
from
his
shallow
and
sandy
grave
better
fate
was
mine
by
some
happy
perverseness
occasioned
perhaps
by
my
disgust
at
the
notion
of
being
received
with
a
pair
of
tongs
i
took
it
into
my
pleasant
head
that
all
the
european
notions
about
contagion
were
thoroughly
unfounded
that
the
plague
might
be
providential
or
epidemic
as
they
phrase
it
but
was
not
contagious
and
that
i
could
not
be
killed
by
the
touch
of
a
woman
s
sleeve
nor
yet
by
her
blessed
breath
i
therefore
determined
that
the
plague
should
not
alter
my
habits
and
amusements
in
any
one
respect
though
i
came
to
this
resolve
from
impulse
i
think
that
i
took
the
course
which
was
in
effect
the
most
prudent
for
the
cheerfulness
of
spirits
which
i
was
thus
enabled
to
retain
discouraged
the
angel
and
prevented
him
from
taking
a
shot
at
me
i
however
so
far
respected
the
opinion
of
the
europeans
that
i
avoided
touching
when
i
could
do
so
without
privation
or
inconvenience
this
endeavour
furnished
me
with
a
sort
of
amusement
as
i
passed
through
the
streets
the
usual
mode
of
moving
from
place
to
place
in
the
city
of
cairo
is
upon
donkeys
of
which
great
numbers
are
always
in
readiness
with
attached
i
had
two
who
constantly
until
one
of
them
died
of
the
plague
waited
at
my
door
upon
the
chance
of
being
wanted
i
found
this
way
of
moving
about
exceedingly
pleasant
and
never
attempted
any
other
i
had
only
to
mount
my
beast
and
tell
my
the
point
for
which
i
was
bound
and
instantly
i
began
to
glide
on
at
a
capital
pace
the
streets
of
cairo
are
not
paved
in
any
way
but
strewed
with
a
dry
sandy
soil
so
deadening
to
sound
that
the
footfall
of
my
donkey
could
scarcely
be
heard
there
is
no
and
as
you
ride
through
the
streets
you
mingle
with
the
people
on
foot
those
who
are
in
your
way
upon
being
warned
by
the
shouts
of
the
move
very
slightly
aside
so
as
to
leave
you
a
narrow
lane
through
which
you
pass
at
a
gallop
in
this
way
you
glide
on
delightfully
in
the
very
midst
of
crowds
without
being
inconvenienced
or
stopped
for
a
moment
it
seems
to
you
that
it
is
not
the
donkey
but
the
who
wafts
you
on
with
his
shouts
through
pleasant
groups
and
air
that
feels
thick
with
the
fragrance
of
burial
spice
eh
sheik
eh
bint
etc
o
old
man
o
virgin
get
out
of
the
way
on
the
virgin
o
old
man
get
out
of
way
on
the
englishman
comes
he
comes
he
comes
the
narrow
alley
which
these
shouts
cleared
for
my
passage
made
it
possible
though
difficult
to
go
on
for
a
long
way
without
touching
a
single
person
and
my
endeavours
to
avoid
such
contact
were
a
sort
of
game
for
me
in
my
loneliness
which
was
not
without
interest
if
i
got
through
a
street
without
being
touched
i
won
if
i
was
touched
i
a
deuce
of
stake
according
to
the
theory
of
the
europeans
but
that
i
deemed
to
be
all
only
lost
that
game
and
would
certainly
win
the
next
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
public
buildings
to
admire
at
cairo
but
i
saw
one
handsome
mosque
to
which
an
instructive
history
is
attached
a
hindustanee
merchant
having
amassed
an
immense
fortune
settled
in
cairo
and
soon
found
that
his
riches
in
the
then
state
of
the
political
world
gave
him
vast
power
in
the
however
the
exercise
of
which
was
much
restrained
by
the
counteracting
influence
of
other
wealthy
men
with
a
view
to
extinguish
every
attempt
at
rivalry
the
hindustanee
merchant
built
this
magnificent
mosque
at
his
own
expense
when
the
work
was
complete
he
invited
all
the
leading
men
of
the
city
to
join
him
in
prayer
within
the
walls
of
the
newly
built
temple
and
he
then
caused
to
be
massacred
all
those
who
were
sufficiently
influential
to
cause
him
any
jealousy
or
short
all
the
respectable
men
of
the
place
after
this
he
possessed
undisputed
power
in
the
city
and
was
greatly
is
revered
to
this
day
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
touching
simplicity
in
the
mode
which
this
man
so
successfully
adopted
for
gaining
the
confidence
and
goodwill
of
his
there
seems
to
be
some
improbability
in
the
story
though
not
nearly
so
gross
as
it
might
appear
to
an
european
ignorant
of
the
east
for
witness
mehemet
ali
s
destruction
of
the
mamelukes
a
closely
similar
act
and
attended
with
the
like
brilliant
success
but
even
if
the
story
be
false
as
a
mere
fact
it
is
perfectly
true
as
an
is
a
true
exposition
of
the
means
by
which
the
respect
and
affection
of
orientals
may
be
conciliated
i
ascended
one
day
to
the
citadel
which
commands
a
superb
view
of
the
town
the
fanciful
and
elaborate
of
the
many
minarets
gives
a
light
and
florid
grace
to
the
city
as
seen
from
this
height
but
before
you
can
look
for
many
seconds
at
such
things
your
eyes
are
drawn
westward
and
over
the
nile
till
they
rest
upon
the
massive
enormities
of
the
ghizeh
pyramids
i
saw
within
the
fortress
many
yoke
of
men
all
haggard
and
woebegone
and
a
kennel
of
very
fine
lions
well
fed
and
flourishing
i
say
of
men
for
the
poor
fellows
were
working
together
in
bonds
i
say
a
of
lions
for
the
beasts
were
not
enclosed
in
cages
but
simply
chained
up
like
dogs
i
went
round
the
bazaars
it
seemed
to
me
that
pipes
and
arms
were
cheaper
here
than
at
constantinople
and
i
should
advise
you
therefore
if
you
go
to
both
places
to
prefer
the
market
of
cairo
i
had
previously
bought
several
of
such
things
at
constantinople
and
did
not
choose
to
encumber
myself
or
to
speak
more
honestly
i
did
not
choose
to
disencumber
my
purse
by
making
any
more
purchases
in
the
open
i
saw
about
fifty
girls
exposed
for
sale
but
all
of
them
black
or
invisible
brown
a
slave
agent
took
me
to
some
rooms
in
the
upper
storey
of
the
building
and
also
into
several
obscure
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
with
a
view
to
show
me
some
white
women
the
owners
raised
various
objections
to
the
display
of
their
ware
and
well
they
might
for
i
had
not
the
least
notion
of
purchasing
some
refused
on
account
of
the
illegality
of
the
proceeding
and
others
declared
that
all
transactions
of
this
sort
were
completely
out
of
the
question
as
long
as
the
plague
was
raging
i
only
succeeded
in
seeing
one
white
slave
who
was
for
sale
but
on
this
one
the
owner
affected
to
set
an
immense
value
and
raised
my
expectations
to
a
high
pitch
by
saying
that
the
girl
was
circassian
and
was
fair
as
the
full
after
a
good
deal
of
delay
i
was
at
last
led
into
a
room
at
the
farther
end
of
which
was
that
mass
of
white
linen
which
indicates
an
eastern
woman
she
was
bid
to
uncover
her
face
and
i
presently
saw
that
though
very
far
from
being
according
to
my
notion
of
beauty
she
had
not
been
inaptly
described
by
the
man
who
compared
her
to
the
full
moon
for
her
large
face
was
perfectly
round
and
perfectly
white
though
very
young
she
was
nevertheless
extremely
fat
she
gave
me
the
idea
of
having
been
got
up
for
sale
of
having
been
fattened
and
whitened
by
medicines
or
by
some
peculiar
diet
i
was
firmly
determined
not
to
see
any
more
of
her
than
the
face
she
was
perhaps
disgusted
at
this
my
virtuous
resolve
as
well
as
with
my
personal
appearance
perhaps
she
saw
my
distaste
and
disappointment
perhaps
she
wished
to
gain
favour
with
her
owner
by
showing
her
attachment
to
his
faith
at
all
events
she
holloaed
out
very
lustily
and
very
decidedly
that
she
would
not
be
bought
by
the
whilst
i
remained
at
cairo
i
thought
it
worth
while
to
see
something
of
the
magicians
because
i
considered
that
these
men
were
in
some
sort
the
descendants
of
those
who
contended
so
stoutly
against
the
superior
power
of
aaron
i
therefore
sent
for
an
old
man
who
was
held
to
be
the
chief
of
the
magicians
and
desired
him
to
show
me
the
wonders
of
his
art
the
old
man
looked
and
dressed
his
character
exceedingly
well
the
vast
turban
the
flowing
beard
and
the
ample
robes
were
all
that
one
could
wish
in
the
way
of
appearance
the
first
experiment
a
very
stale
one
which
he
attempted
to
perform
for
me
was
that
of
showing
the
forms
and
faces
of
my
absent
friends
not
to
me
but
to
a
boy
brought
in
from
the
streets
for
the
purpose
and
said
to
be
chosen
at
random
a
pan
of
burning
charcoal
was
brought
into
my
room
and
the
magician
bending
over
it
sprinkled
upon
the
fire
some
substances
which
must
have
consisted
partly
of
spices
or
sweetly
burning
woods
for
immediately
a
fragrant
smoke
arose
that
curled
around
the
bending
form
of
the
wizard
the
while
that
he
pronounced
his
first
incantations
when
these
were
over
the
boy
was
made
to
sit
down
and
a
common
green
shade
was
bound
over
his
brow
then
the
wizard
took
ink
and
still
continuing
his
incantations
wrote
certain
mysterious
figures
upon
the
boy
s
palm
and
directed
him
to
rivet
his
attention
to
these
marks
without
looking
aside
for
an
instant
again
the
incantations
proceeded
and
after
a
while
the
boy
being
seemingly
a
little
agitated
was
asked
whether
he
saw
anything
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
declared
that
he
saw
a
kind
of
military
procession
with
flags
and
banners
which
he
described
rather
minutely
i
was
then
called
upon
to
name
the
absent
person
whose
form
was
to
be
made
visible
i
named
keate
you
were
not
at
eton
and
i
must
tell
you
therefore
what
manner
of
man
it
was
that
i
named
though
i
think
you
must
have
some
idea
of
him
already
for
wherever
from
utmost
canada
to
there
was
the
whitewashed
wall
of
an
officer
s
room
or
of
any
other
apartment
in
which
english
gentlemen
are
forced
to
kick
their
heels
there
likely
enough
in
the
days
of
his
reign
the
head
of
keate
would
be
seen
scratched
or
drawn
with
those
various
degrees
of
skill
which
one
observes
in
the
representations
of
saints
anybody
without
the
least
notion
of
drawing
could
still
draw
a
speaking
nay
scolding
likeness
of
keate
if
you
had
no
pencil
you
could
draw
him
well
enough
with
a
poker
or
the
leg
of
a
chair
or
the
smoke
of
a
candle
he
was
little
more
if
more
at
all
than
five
feet
in
height
and
was
not
very
great
in
girth
but
in
this
space
was
concentrated
the
pluck
of
ten
battalions
he
had
a
really
noble
voice
which
he
could
modulate
with
great
skill
but
he
had
also
the
power
of
quacking
like
an
angry
duck
and
he
almost
always
adopted
this
mode
of
communication
in
order
to
inspire
respect
he
was
a
capital
scholar
but
his
ingenuous
learning
had
softened
his
manners
and
permitted
them
to
be
fierce
fierce
he
had
the
most
complete
command
over
his
mean
over
his
temper
which
he
scarcely
ever
allowed
to
appear
you
could
not
put
him
out
of
is
out
of
the
which
he
thought
to
be
fitting
for
a
headmaster
his
red
shaggy
eyebrows
were
so
prominent
that
he
habitually
used
them
as
arms
and
hands
for
the
purpose
of
pointing
out
any
object
towards
which
he
wished
to
direct
attention
the
rest
of
his
features
were
equally
striking
in
their
way
and
were
all
and
all
his
own
he
wore
a
partly
resembling
the
costume
of
napoleon
and
partly
that
of
a
i
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
named
anybody
more
decidedly
differing
in
appearance
from
the
rest
of
the
human
race
whom
do
you
name
i
name
john
now
what
do
you
see
said
the
wizard
to
the
i
see
answered
the
boy
i
see
a
fair
girl
with
golden
hair
blue
eyes
pallid
face
rosy
was
a
shot
i
shouted
out
my
laughter
to
the
horror
of
the
wizard
who
perceiving
the
grossness
of
his
failure
declared
that
the
boy
must
have
known
sin
for
none
but
the
innocent
can
see
truth
and
accordingly
kicked
him
downstairs
one
or
two
other
boys
were
tried
but
none
could
see
truth
they
all
made
sadly
bad
notwithstanding
the
failure
of
these
experiments
i
wished
to
see
what
sort
of
mummery
my
magician
would
practise
if
i
called
upon
him
to
show
me
some
performances
of
a
higher
order
than
those
which
had
been
attempted
i
therefore
entered
into
a
treaty
with
him
in
virtue
of
which
he
was
to
descend
with
me
into
the
tombs
near
the
pyramids
and
there
evoke
the
devil
the
negotiation
lasted
some
time
for
dthemetri
as
in
duty
bound
tried
to
beat
down
the
wizard
as
much
as
he
could
and
the
wizard
on
his
part
manfully
stuck
up
for
his
price
declaring
that
to
raise
the
devil
was
really
no
joke
and
insinuating
that
to
do
so
was
an
awesome
crime
i
let
dthemetri
have
his
way
in
the
negotiation
but
i
felt
in
reality
very
indifferent
about
the
sum
to
be
paid
and
for
this
reason
namely
that
the
payment
except
a
very
small
present
which
i
might
make
or
not
as
i
chose
was
to
be
on
at
length
the
bargain
was
made
and
it
was
arranged
that
after
a
few
days
to
be
allowed
for
preparation
the
wizard
should
raise
the
devil
for
two
pounds
ten
play
or
devil
no
piastres
the
wizard
failed
to
keep
his
appointment
i
sent
to
know
why
the
deuce
he
had
not
come
to
raise
the
devil
the
truth
was
that
my
mahomet
had
gone
to
the
mountain
the
plague
had
seized
him
and
he
died
although
the
plague
had
now
spread
terrible
havoc
around
me
i
did
not
see
very
plainly
any
corresponding
change
in
the
looks
of
the
streets
until
the
seventh
day
after
my
arrival
i
then
first
observed
that
the
city
was
there
were
no
outward
signs
of
despair
nor
of
violent
terror
but
many
of
the
voices
that
had
swelled
the
busy
hum
of
men
were
already
hushed
in
death
and
the
survivors
so
used
to
scream
and
screech
in
their
earnestness
whenever
they
bought
or
sold
now
showed
an
unwonted
indifference
about
the
affairs
of
this
world
it
was
less
worth
while
for
men
to
haggle
and
haggle
and
crack
the
sky
with
noisy
bargains
when
the
great
commander
was
there
who
could
pay
all
their
debts
with
the
roll
of
his
at
this
time
i
was
informed
that
of
thousand
people
at
alexandria
twelve
thousand
had
died
already
the
destroyer
had
come
rather
later
to
cairo
but
there
was
nothing
of
weariness
in
his
strides
the
deaths
came
faster
than
ever
they
befell
in
the
plague
of
london
but
the
calmness
of
orientals
under
such
visitations
and
the
habit
of
using
biers
for
interment
instead
of
burying
coffins
along
with
the
bodies
rendered
it
practicable
to
dispose
of
the
dead
in
the
usual
way
without
shocking
the
people
by
any
unaccustomed
spectacle
of
horror
there
was
no
tumbling
of
bodies
into
carts
as
in
the
plague
of
florence
and
the
plague
of
london
every
man
according
to
his
station
was
properly
buried
and
that
in
the
usual
way
except
that
he
went
to
his
grave
in
a
more
hurried
pace
than
might
have
been
adopted
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
funerals
which
poured
through
the
streets
were
not
the
only
public
evidence
of
deaths
in
cairo
this
custom
prevails
at
the
instant
of
a
man
s
death
if
his
property
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
expense
professional
howlers
are
employed
i
believe
that
these
persons
are
brought
near
to
the
dying
man
when
his
end
appears
to
be
approaching
and
the
moment
that
life
is
gone
they
lift
up
their
voices
and
send
forth
a
loud
wail
from
the
chamber
of
death
thus
i
knew
when
my
near
neighbours
died
sometimes
the
howls
were
near
sometimes
more
distant
once
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
the
wail
of
death
in
the
next
house
and
another
time
by
a
like
howl
from
the
house
opposite
and
there
were
two
or
three
minutes
i
recollect
during
which
the
howl
seemed
to
be
actually
along
the
street
i
happened
to
be
rather
teased
at
this
time
by
a
sore
throat
and
i
thought
it
would
be
well
to
get
it
cured
if
i
could
before
i
again
started
on
my
travels
i
therefore
inquired
for
a
frank
doctor
and
was
informed
that
the
only
one
then
at
cairo
was
a
young
bolognese
refugee
who
was
so
poor
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
flight
as
the
other
medical
men
had
done
at
such
a
time
as
this
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
for
a
european
physician
a
person
thus
summoned
would
be
sure
to
suppose
that
the
patient
was
ill
of
the
plague
and
would
decline
to
come
i
therefore
rode
to
the
young
doctor
s
residence
after
experiencing
some
little
difficulty
in
finding
where
to
look
for
him
i
ascended
a
flight
or
two
of
stairs
and
knocked
at
his
door
no
one
came
immediately
but
after
some
little
delay
the
medico
himself
opened
the
door
and
admitted
me
i
of
course
made
him
understand
that
i
had
come
to
consult
him
but
before
entering
upon
my
throat
grievance
i
accepted
a
chair
and
exchanged
a
sentence
or
two
of
commonplace
conversation
now
the
natural
commonplace
of
the
city
at
this
season
was
of
a
gloomy
sort
come
va
la
peste
how
goes
the
plague
and
this
was
precisely
the
question
i
put
a
deep
sigh
and
the
words
sette
cento
per
giorno
signor
seven
hundred
a
day
pronounced
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
sadness
and
dejection
were
the
answer
i
received
the
day
was
not
oppressively
hot
yet
i
saw
that
the
doctor
was
perspiring
profusely
and
even
the
outside
surface
of
the
thick
shawl
in
which
he
had
wrapped
himself
appeared
to
be
moist
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
but
the
deep
melancholy
of
his
tone
did
not
tempt
me
to
prolong
the
conversation
and
without
further
delay
i
requested
that
my
throat
might
be
looked
at
the
medico
held
my
chin
in
the
usual
way
and
examined
my
throat
he
then
wrote
me
a
prescription
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
i
bade
him
farewell
but
as
he
conducted
me
towards
the
door
i
observed
an
expression
of
strange
and
unhappy
watchfulness
in
his
rolling
eyes
it
was
not
the
next
day
but
the
next
day
but
one
if
i
rightly
remember
that
i
sent
to
request
another
interview
with
my
doctor
in
due
time
dthemetri
who
was
my
messenger
returned
looking
sadly
had
the
medico
for
so
he
phrased
it
coming
out
from
his
a
bier
it
was
of
course
plain
that
when
the
poor
bolognese
was
looking
at
my
throat
and
almost
mingling
his
breath
with
mine
he
was
stricken
of
the
plague
i
suppose
that
the
violent
sweat
in
which
i
found
him
had
been
produced
by
some
medicine
which
he
must
have
taken
in
the
hope
of
curing
himself
the
peculiar
rolling
of
the
eyes
which
i
had
remarked
is
i
believe
to
experienced
observers
a
pretty
sure
test
of
the
plague
a
russian
acquaintance
of
mine
speaking
from
the
information
of
men
who
had
made
the
turkish
campaigns
of
and
told
me
that
by
this
sign
the
officers
of
sabalkansky
s
force
were
able
to
make
out
the
soldiers
with
a
good
deal
of
certainty
it
so
happened
that
most
of
the
people
with
whom
i
had
anything
to
do
during
my
stay
at
cairo
were
seized
with
plague
and
all
these
died
since
i
had
been
for
a
long
time
before
i
reached
egypt
and
was
about
to
start
again
for
another
long
journey
over
the
desert
there
were
of
course
many
little
matters
touching
my
wardrobe
and
my
travelling
equipments
which
required
to
be
attended
to
whilst
i
remained
in
the
city
it
happened
so
many
times
that
dthemetri
s
orders
in
respect
to
these
matters
were
frustrated
by
the
deaths
of
the
tradespeople
and
others
whom
he
employed
that
at
last
i
became
quite
accustomed
to
the
peculiar
manner
which
he
assumed
when
he
prepared
to
announce
a
new
death
to
me
the
poor
fellow
naturally
supposed
that
i
should
feel
some
uneasiness
at
hearing
of
the
accidents
which
happened
to
persons
employed
by
me
and
he
therefore
communicated
their
deaths
as
though
they
were
the
deaths
of
friends
he
would
cast
down
his
eyes
and
look
like
a
man
abashed
and
then
gently
and
with
a
mournful
gesture
allow
the
words
morto
signor
to
come
through
his
lips
i
don
t
know
how
many
of
such
instances
occurred
but
they
were
several
and
besides
these
as
i
told
you
before
my
banker
my
doctor
my
landlord
and
my
magician
all
died
of
the
plague
a
lad
who
acted
as
a
helper
in
the
house
which
i
occupied
lost
a
brother
and
a
sister
within
a
few
hours
out
of
my
two
established
one
died
i
did
not
hear
of
any
instance
in
which
a
patient
had
recovered
going
out
one
morning
i
met
unexpectedly
the
scorching
breath
of
the
kamsin
wind
and
fearing
that
i
should
faint
under
the
horrible
sensations
which
it
caused
i
returned
to
my
rooms
reflecting
however
that
i
might
have
to
encounter
this
wind
in
the
desert
where
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
avoiding
it
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
brave
it
once
more
in
the
city
and
to
try
whether
i
could
really
bear
it
or
not
i
therefore
mounted
my
ass
and
rode
to
old
cairo
and
along
the
gardens
by
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
wind
was
hot
to
the
touch
as
though
it
came
from
a
furnace
it
blew
strongly
but
yet
with
such
perfect
steadiness
that
the
trees
bending
under
its
force
remained
fixed
in
the
same
curves
without
perceptibly
waving
the
whole
sky
was
obscured
by
a
veil
of
yellowish
grey
that
shut
out
the
face
of
the
sun
the
streets
were
utterly
silent
being
indeed
almost
entirely
deserted
and
not
without
cause
for
the
scorching
blast
whilst
it
fevers
the
blood
closes
up
the
pores
of
the
skin
and
is
terribly
distressing
therefore
to
every
animal
that
encounters
it
i
returned
to
my
rooms
dreadfully
my
head
ached
with
a
burning
pain
and
my
pulse
bounded
quick
and
fitfully
but
perhaps
as
in
the
instance
of
the
poor
levantine
whose
death
i
was
mentioning
the
fear
and
excitement
which
i
felt
in
trying
my
own
wrist
may
have
made
my
blood
flutter
the
faster
it
is
a
thoroughly
well
believed
theory
that
during
the
continuance
of
the
plague
you
can
t
be
ill
of
any
other
febrile
unpleasant
privilege
that
for
ill
i
was
and
ill
of
fever
and
i
anxiously
wished
that
the
ailment
might
turn
out
to
be
anything
rather
than
plague
i
had
some
right
to
surmise
that
my
illness
may
have
been
merely
the
effect
of
the
hot
wind
and
this
notion
was
encouraged
by
the
elasticity
of
my
spirits
and
by
a
strong
forefeeling
that
much
of
my
destined
life
in
this
world
was
yet
to
come
and
yet
to
be
fulfilled
that
was
my
instinctive
belief
but
when
i
carefully
weighed
the
probabilities
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
strength
of
argument
was
all
against
me
there
was
a
strong
antecedent
likelihood
in
of
my
being
struck
by
the
same
blow
as
the
rest
of
the
people
who
had
been
dying
around
me
besides
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
the
universal
opinion
of
the
europeans
upon
a
medical
question
such
as
that
of
contagion
might
probably
be
correct
and
it
i
was
so
thoroughly
compromised
and
especially
by
the
touch
and
breath
of
the
dying
medico
that
i
had
no
right
to
expect
any
other
fate
than
that
which
now
seemed
to
have
overtaken
me
balancing
as
well
as
i
could
all
the
considerations
which
hope
and
fear
suggested
i
slowly
and
reluctantly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
according
to
all
merely
reasonable
probability
the
plague
had
come
upon
me
you
would
suppose
that
this
conviction
would
have
induced
me
to
write
a
few
farewell
lines
to
those
who
were
dearest
and
that
having
done
that
i
should
have
turned
my
thoughts
towards
the
world
to
come
such
however
was
not
the
case
i
believe
that
the
prospect
of
death
often
brings
with
it
strong
anxieties
about
matters
of
comparatively
trivial
import
and
certainly
with
me
the
whole
energy
of
the
mind
was
directed
towards
the
one
petty
object
of
concealing
my
illness
until
the
latest
possible
the
delirious
stage
i
did
not
believe
that
either
mysseri
or
dthemetri
who
had
served
me
so
faithfully
in
all
trials
would
have
deserted
me
as
most
europeans
are
wont
to
do
when
they
knew
that
i
was
stricken
by
plague
but
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
putting
them
to
this
test
and
i
dreaded
the
consternation
which
the
knowledge
of
my
illness
would
be
sure
to
occasion
i
was
very
ill
indeed
at
the
moment
when
my
dinner
was
served
and
my
soul
sickened
at
the
sight
of
the
food
but
i
had
luckily
the
habit
of
dispensing
with
the
attendance
of
servants
during
my
meal
and
as
soon
as
i
was
left
alone
i
made
a
melancholy
calculation
of
the
quantity
of
food
which
i
should
have
eaten
if
i
had
been
in
my
usual
health
and
filled
my
plates
accordingly
and
gave
myself
salt
and
so
on
as
though
i
were
going
to
dine
i
then
transferred
the
viands
to
a
piece
of
the
omnipresent
newspaper
and
hid
them
away
in
a
cupboard
for
it
was
not
yet
night
and
i
dared
not
throw
the
food
into
the
street
until
darkness
came
i
did
not
at
all
relish
this
process
of
fictitious
dining
but
at
length
the
cloth
was
removed
and
i
gladly
reclined
on
my
divan
i
would
not
lie
down
with
the
in
my
hand
i
had
a
feeling
that
tea
would
be
a
capital
thing
for
me
but
i
would
not
order
it
until
the
usual
hour
when
at
last
the
time
came
i
drank
deep
draughts
from
the
fragrant
cup
the
effect
was
almost
instantaneous
a
plenteous
sweat
burst
through
my
skin
and
watered
my
clothes
through
and
through
i
kept
myself
thickly
covered
the
hot
tormenting
weight
which
had
been
loading
my
brain
was
slowly
heaved
away
the
fever
was
extinguished
i
felt
a
new
buoyancy
of
spirits
and
an
unusual
activity
of
mind
i
went
into
my
bed
under
a
load
of
thick
covering
and
when
the
morning
came
and
i
asked
myself
how
i
was
i
found
that
i
was
thoroughly
well
i
was
very
anxious
to
procure
if
possible
some
medical
advice
for
mysseri
whose
illness
prevented
my
departure
every
one
of
the
european
practising
doctors
of
whom
there
had
been
many
had
either
died
or
fled
it
was
said
however
that
there
was
an
englishman
in
the
medical
service
of
the
pasha
who
quietly
remained
at
his
post
but
that
he
never
engaged
in
private
practice
i
determined
to
try
if
i
could
obtain
assistance
in
this
quarter
i
did
not
venture
at
first
and
at
such
a
time
as
this
to
ask
him
to
visit
a
servant
who
was
prostrate
on
the
bed
of
sickness
but
thinking
that
i
might
thus
gain
an
opportunity
of
persuading
him
to
attend
mysseri
i
wrote
a
note
mentioning
my
own
affair
of
the
sore
throat
and
asking
for
the
benefit
of
his
medical
advice
he
instantly
followed
back
my
messenger
and
was
at
once
shown
up
into
my
room
i
entreated
him
to
stand
off
telling
him
fairly
how
deeply
i
was
compromised
and
especially
by
my
contact
with
a
person
actually
ill
and
since
dead
of
plague
the
generous
fellow
with
a
laugh
at
the
terrors
of
the
contagionists
marched
straight
up
to
me
and
forcibly
seized
my
hand
and
shook
it
with
manly
violence
i
felt
grateful
indeed
and
swelled
with
fresh
pride
of
race
because
that
my
countryman
could
carry
himself
so
nobly
he
soon
cured
mysseri
as
well
as
me
and
all
this
he
did
from
no
other
motives
than
the
pleasure
of
doing
a
kindness
and
the
delight
of
braving
a
danger
at
length
the
great
difficulty
which
i
had
had
in
procuring
beasts
for
my
departure
was
overcome
and
now
too
i
was
to
have
the
new
excitement
of
travelling
on
dromedaries
with
two
of
these
beasts
and
three
camels
i
gladly
wound
my
way
from
out
of
the
city
as
i
passed
through
the
streets
i
observed
a
elder
who
stretched
forth
his
arms
and
lifted
up
his
voice
in
a
speech
which
seemed
to
have
some
reference
to
me
requiring
an
interpretation
i
found
that
the
man
had
said
the
pasha
seeks
camels
and
he
finds
them
not
the
englishman
says
let
camels
be
brought
and
behold
there
they
are
i
no
sooner
breathed
the
free
wholesome
air
of
the
desert
than
i
felt
that
a
great
burden
which
i
had
been
scarcely
conscious
of
bearing
was
lifted
away
from
my
mind
for
nearly
three
weeks
i
had
lived
under
peril
of
death
the
peril
ceased
and
not
till
then
did
i
know
how
much
alarm
and
anxiety
i
had
really
been
suffering
chapter
xix
the
pyramids
i
went
to
see
and
to
explore
the
pyramids
familiar
to
one
from
the
days
of
early
childhood
are
the
forms
of
the
egyptian
pyramids
and
now
as
i
approached
them
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
i
had
no
print
no
picture
before
me
and
yet
the
old
shapes
were
there
there
was
no
change
they
were
just
as
i
had
always
known
them
i
straightened
myself
in
my
stirrups
and
strived
to
persuade
my
understanding
that
this
was
real
egypt
and
that
those
angles
which
stood
up
between
me
and
the
west
were
of
harder
stuff
and
more
ancient
than
the
paper
pyramids
of
the
green
portfolio
yet
it
was
not
till
i
came
to
the
base
of
the
great
pyramid
that
reality
began
to
weigh
upon
my
mind
strange
to
say
the
bigness
of
the
distinct
blocks
of
stones
was
the
first
sign
by
which
i
attained
to
feel
the
immensity
of
the
whole
pile
when
i
came
and
trod
and
touched
with
my
hands
and
climbed
in
order
that
by
climbing
i
might
come
to
the
top
of
one
single
stone
then
and
almost
suddenly
a
cold
sense
and
understanding
of
the
pyramid
s
enormity
came
down
overcasting
my
brain
now
try
to
endure
this
homely
illustration
of
the
effect
produced
upon
one
s
mind
by
the
mere
vastness
of
the
great
pyramid
when
i
was
very
young
between
the
ages
i
believe
of
three
and
five
years
old
being
then
of
delicate
health
i
was
often
in
time
of
night
the
victim
of
a
strange
kind
of
mental
oppression
i
lay
in
my
bed
perfectly
conscious
and
with
open
eyes
but
without
power
to
speak
or
to
move
and
all
the
while
my
brain
was
oppressed
to
distraction
by
the
presence
of
a
single
and
abstract
idea
the
idea
of
solid
immensity
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
agonies
that
the
horror
of
this
visitation
arose
from
its
coming
upon
me
without
form
or
shape
that
the
close
presence
of
the
direst
monster
ever
bred
in
hell
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
more
tolerable
than
that
simple
idea
of
solid
size
my
aching
mind
was
fixed
and
riveted
down
upon
the
mere
quality
of
vastness
vastness
vastness
and
was
not
permitted
to
invest
with
it
any
particular
object
if
i
could
have
done
so
the
torment
would
have
ceased
when
at
last
i
was
roused
from
this
state
of
suffering
i
could
not
of
course
in
those
days
knowing
no
verbal
metaphysics
and
no
metaphysics
at
all
except
by
the
dreadful
experience
of
an
abstract
idea
could
not
of
course
find
words
to
describe
the
nature
of
my
sensations
and
even
now
i
can
not
explain
why
it
is
that
the
forced
contemplation
of
a
mere
quality
distinct
from
matter
should
be
so
terrible
well
now
my
eyes
saw
and
knew
and
my
hands
and
my
feet
informed
my
understanding
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
abstract
about
the
great
was
a
big
triangle
sufficiently
concrete
easy
to
see
and
rough
to
the
touch
it
could
not
of
course
affect
me
with
the
peculiar
sensation
which
i
have
been
talking
of
but
yet
there
was
something
akin
to
that
old
nightmare
agony
in
the
terrible
completeness
with
which
a
mere
mass
of
masonry
could
fill
and
load
my
mind
and
time
too
the
remoteness
of
its
origin
no
less
than
the
enormity
of
its
proportions
screens
an
egyptian
pyramid
from
the
easy
and
familiar
contact
of
our
modern
minds
at
its
base
the
common
earth
ends
and
all
above
is
a
not
created
of
god
not
seeming
to
be
made
by
men
s
hands
but
rather
the
sheer
of
some
old
dismal
age
weighing
down
this
younger
planet
fine
sayings
but
the
truth
seems
to
be
after
all
that
the
pyramids
are
quite
of
this
world
that
they
were
piled
up
into
the
air
for
the
realisation
of
some
kingly
crotchets
about
immortality
some
priestly
longing
for
burial
fees
and
that
as
for
the
building
they
were
built
like
coral
rocks
by
swarms
of
swarms
of
poor
egyptians
who
were
not
only
the
abject
tools
and
slaves
of
power
but
who
also
ate
onions
for
the
reward
of
their
immortal
labours
the
pyramids
are
quite
of
this
world
i
of
course
ascended
to
the
summit
of
the
great
pyramid
and
also
explored
its
chambers
but
these
i
need
not
describe
the
first
time
that
i
went
to
the
pyramids
of
ghizeh
there
were
a
number
of
arabs
hanging
about
in
its
neighbourhood
and
wanting
to
receive
presents
on
various
pretences
their
sheik
was
with
them
there
was
also
present
an
fellow
in
soldier
s
uniform
this
man
on
my
departure
claimed
a
reward
on
the
ground
that
he
had
maintained
order
and
decorum
amongst
the
arabs
his
claim
was
not
considered
valid
by
my
dragoman
and
was
rejected
accordingly
my
afterwards
said
they
had
overheard
this
fellow
propose
to
the
sheik
to
put
me
to
death
whilst
i
was
in
the
interior
of
the
great
pyramid
and
to
share
with
him
the
booty
fancy
a
struggle
for
life
in
one
of
those
burial
chambers
with
acres
and
acres
of
solid
masonry
between
one
s
self
and
the
daylight
i
felt
exceedingly
glad
that
i
had
not
made
the
rascal
a
present
i
visited
the
very
ancient
pyramids
of
aboukir
and
sakkara
there
are
many
of
these
and
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
and
it
struck
me
that
taken
together
they
might
be
considered
as
showing
the
progress
and
perfection
such
as
it
is
of
pyramidical
architecture
one
of
the
pyramids
at
sakkara
is
almost
a
rival
for
the
monster
at
ghizeh
others
are
scarcely
more
than
vast
heaps
of
brick
and
stone
these
last
suggested
to
me
the
idea
that
after
all
the
pyramid
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
variety
of
the
sepulchral
mound
so
common
in
most
countries
including
i
believe
hindustan
from
whence
the
egyptians
are
supposed
to
have
come
men
accustomed
to
raise
these
structures
for
their
dead
kings
or
conquerors
would
carry
the
usage
with
them
in
their
migrations
but
arriving
in
egypt
and
seeing
the
impossibility
of
finding
earth
sufficiently
tenacious
for
a
mound
they
would
approximate
as
nearly
as
might
be
to
their
ancient
custom
by
raising
up
a
round
heap
of
short
conical
pyramids
of
these
there
are
several
at
sakkara
and
the
materials
of
some
are
thrown
together
without
any
order
or
regularity
the
transition
from
this
simple
form
to
that
of
the
square
angular
pyramid
was
easy
and
natural
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
gradations
through
which
the
style
passed
from
infancy
up
to
its
mature
enormity
could
plainly
be
traced
at
sakkara
chapter
xx
the
sphinx
and
near
the
pyramids
more
wondrous
and
more
awful
than
all
else
in
the
land
of
egypt
there
sits
the
lonely
sphinx
comely
the
creature
is
but
the
comeliness
is
not
of
this
world
the
once
worshipped
beast
is
a
deformity
and
a
monster
to
this
generation
and
yet
you
can
see
that
those
lips
so
thick
and
heavy
were
fashioned
according
to
some
ancient
mould
of
mould
of
beauty
now
because
that
greece
drew
forth
cytherea
from
the
flashing
foam
of
the
ægean
and
in
her
image
created
new
forms
of
beauty
and
made
it
a
law
among
men
that
the
short
and
proudly
wreathed
lip
should
stand
for
the
sign
and
the
main
condition
of
loveliness
through
all
generations
to
come
yet
still
there
lives
on
the
race
of
those
who
were
beautiful
in
the
fashion
of
the
elder
world
and
christian
girls
of
coptic
blood
will
look
on
you
with
the
sad
serious
gaze
and
kiss
you
your
charitable
hand
with
the
big
pouting
lips
of
the
very
sphinx
laugh
and
mock
if
you
will
at
the
worship
of
stone
idols
but
mark
ye
this
ye
breakers
of
images
that
in
one
regard
the
stone
idol
bears
awful
semblance
of
in
the
midst
of
change
the
same
seeming
will
and
intent
for
ever
and
ever
inexorable
upon
ancient
dynasties
of
ethiopian
and
egyptian
kings
upon
greek
and
roman
upon
arab
and
ottoman
conquerors
upon
napoleon
dreaming
of
an
eastern
empire
upon
battle
and
pestilence
upon
the
ceaseless
misery
of
the
egyptian
race
upon
yesterday
and
warburton
upon
all
and
more
this
unworldly
sphinx
has
watched
and
watched
like
a
providence
with
the
same
earnest
eyes
and
the
same
sad
tranquil
mien
and
we
we
shall
die
and
islam
will
wither
away
and
the
englishman
leaning
far
over
to
hold
his
loved
india
will
plant
a
firm
foot
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
sit
in
the
seats
of
the
faithful
and
still
that
sleepless
rock
will
lie
watching
and
watching
the
works
of
the
new
busy
race
with
those
same
sad
earnest
eyes
and
the
same
tranquil
mien
everlasting
you
dare
not
mock
at
the

chapter
xxi
cairo
to
suez
the
dromedary
of
egypt
and
syria
is
not
the
animal
described
by
that
name
in
books
of
natural
history
but
is
in
fact
of
the
same
family
as
the
camel
to
which
it
stands
in
about
the
same
relation
as
a
racer
to
a
the
fleetness
and
endurance
of
this
creature
are
extraordinary
it
is
not
usual
to
force
him
into
a
gallop
and
i
fancy
from
his
make
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
maintain
that
pace
for
any
length
of
time
but
the
animal
is
on
so
large
a
scale
that
the
jogtrot
at
which
he
is
generally
ridden
implies
a
progress
of
perhaps
ten
or
twelve
miles
an
hour
and
this
pace
it
is
said
he
can
keep
up
incessantly
without
food
or
water
or
rest
for
three
whole
days
and
nights
of
the
two
dromedaries
which
i
had
obtained
for
this
journey
i
mounted
one
myself
and
put
dthemetri
on
the
other
my
plan
was
to
ride
on
with
dthemetri
to
suez
as
rapidly
as
the
fleetness
of
the
beasts
would
allow
and
to
let
mysseri
who
was
still
weak
from
the
effects
of
his
late
illness
come
quietly
on
with
the
camels
and
baggage
the
trot
of
the
dromedary
is
a
pace
terribly
disagreeeble
to
the
rider
until
he
becomes
a
little
accustomed
to
it
but
after
the
first
i
so
far
schooled
myself
to
this
new
exercise
that
i
felt
capable
of
keeping
it
up
though
not
without
aching
limbs
for
several
hours
together
now
therefore
i
was
anxious
to
dart
forward
and
annihilate
at
once
the
whole
space
that
divided
me
from
the
red
sea
dthemetri
however
could
not
get
on
at
all
every
attempt
which
he
made
to
trot
seemed
to
threaten
the
utter
dislocation
of
his
whole
frame
and
indeed
i
doubt
whether
anyone
of
dthemetri
s
age
nearly
forty
i
think
and
unaccustomed
to
such
exercise
could
have
borne
it
at
all
easily
besides
the
dromedary
which
fell
to
his
lot
was
evidently
a
very
bad
one
he
every
now
and
then
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
coolly
knelt
down
as
though
suggesting
that
the
rider
had
better
get
off
at
once
and
abandon
the
attempt
as
one
that
was
utterly
hopeless
when
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
i
saw
dthemetri
thus
planted
i
lost
my
patience
and
went
on
without
him
for
about
two
hours
i
think
i
advanced
without
once
looking
behind
me
i
then
paused
and
cast
my
eyes
back
to
the
western
horizon
there
was
no
sign
of
dthemetri
nor
of
any
other
living
creature
this
i
expected
for
i
knew
that
i
must
have
far
all
my
followers
i
had
ridden
away
from
my
party
merely
by
way
of
gratifying
my
impatience
and
with
the
intention
of
stopping
as
soon
as
i
felt
tired
until
i
was
overtaken
i
now
observed
however
this
i
had
not
been
able
to
do
whilst
advancing
so
rapidly
that
the
track
which
i
had
been
following
was
seemingly
the
track
of
only
one
or
two
camels
i
did
not
fear
that
i
had
diverged
very
largely
from
the
true
route
but
still
i
could
not
feel
any
reasonable
certainty
that
my
party
would
follow
any
line
of
march
within
sight
of
me
i
had
to
consider
therefore
whether
i
should
remain
where
i
was
upon
the
chance
of
seeing
my
people
come
up
or
whether
i
would
push
on
alone
and
find
my
way
to
suez
i
had
now
learned
that
i
could
not
rely
upon
the
continued
guidance
of
any
track
but
i
knew
that
if
maps
were
right
the
point
for
which
i
was
bound
bore
just
due
east
of
cairo
and
i
thought
that
although
i
might
miss
the
line
leading
most
directly
to
suez
i
could
not
well
fail
to
find
my
way
sooner
or
later
to
the
red
sea
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
had
no
provision
of
food
or
water
with
me
and
already
i
was
beginning
to
feel
thirst
i
deliberated
for
a
minute
and
then
determined
that
i
would
abandon
all
hope
of
seeing
my
party
again
in
the
desert
and
would
push
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
towards
suez
it
was
not
i
confess
without
a
sensation
of
awe
that
i
swept
with
my
sight
the
vacant
round
of
the
horizon
and
remembered
that
i
was
all
alone
and
unprovisioned
in
the
midst
of
the
arid
waste
but
this
very
awe
gave
tone
and
zest
to
the
exultation
with
which
i
felt
myself
launched
hitherto
in
all
my
wandering
i
had
been
under
the
care
of
other
tatars
guides
and
dragomen
had
watched
over
my
welfare
but
now
at
last
i
was
here
in
this
african
desert
and
i
and
no
other
had
charge
of
my
i
liked
the
office
well
i
had
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
before
me
a
very
fair
dromedary
a
fur
pelisse
and
a
brace
of
pistols
but
no
bread
and
no
water
for
that
i
must
ride
i
did
for
several
hours
i
urged
forward
my
beast
at
a
rapid
though
steady
pace
but
now
the
pangs
of
thirst
began
to
torment
me
i
did
not
relax
my
pace
however
and
i
had
not
suffered
long
when
a
moving
object
appeared
in
the
distance
before
me
the
intervening
space
was
soon
traversed
and
i
found
myself
approaching
a
bedouin
arab
mounted
on
a
camel
attended
by
another
bedouin
on
foot
they
stopped
i
saw
that
as
usual
there
hung
from
the
of
the
camel
a
large
skin
which
seemed
to
be
well
filled
i
steered
my
dromedary
close
up
alongside
of
the
mounted
bedouin
caused
my
beast
to
kneel
down
then
alighted
and
keeping
the
end
of
the
halter
in
my
hand
went
up
to
the
mounted
bedouin
without
speaking
took
hold
of
his
opened
it
and
drank
long
and
deep
from
its
leathern
lips
both
of
the
bedouins
stood
fast
in
amazement
and
mute
horror
and
really
if
they
had
never
happened
to
see
a
european
before
the
apparition
was
enough
to
startle
them
to
see
for
the
first
time
a
coat
and
a
waistcoat
with
the
semblance
of
a
white
human
head
at
the
top
and
for
this
ghastly
figure
to
come
swiftly
out
of
the
horizon
upon
a
fleet
dromedary
approach
them
silently
and
with
a
demoniacal
smile
and
drink
a
deep
draught
from
their
was
enough
to
make
the
bedouins
stare
a
little
they
in
fact
stared
a
great
as
europeans
stare
with
a
restless
and
puzzled
expression
of
countenance
but
with
features
all
fixed
and
rigid
and
with
still
glassy
eyes
before
they
had
time
to
get
decomposed
from
their
state
of
petrifaction
i
had
remounted
my
dromedary
and
was
darting
away
towards
the
east
without
pause
or
remission
of
pace
i
continued
to
press
forward
but
after
a
while
i
found
to
my
confusion
that
the
slight
track
which
had
hitherto
guided
me
now
failed
altogether
i
began
to
fear
that
i
must
have
been
all
along
following
the
course
of
some
wandering
bedouins
and
i
felt
that
if
this
were
the
case
my
fate
was
a
little
uncertain
i
had
no
compass
with
me
but
i
determined
upon
the
eastern
point
of
the
horizon
as
accurately
as
i
could
by
reference
to
the
sun
and
so
laid
down
for
myself
a
way
over
the
pathless
sands
but
now
my
poor
dromedary
by
whose
life
and
strength
i
held
my
own
began
to
show
signs
of
distress
a
thick
clammy
and
glutinous
kind
of
foam
gathered
about
her
lips
and
piteous
sobs
burst
from
her
bosom
in
the
tones
of
human
misery
i
doubted
for
a
moment
whether
i
would
give
her
a
little
rest
a
relaxation
of
pace
but
i
decided
that
i
would
not
and
continued
to
push
forward
as
steadily
as
before
the
character
of
the
country
became
changed
i
had
ridden
away
from
the
level
tracts
and
before
me
now
and
on
either
side
there
were
vast
hills
of
sand
and
calcined
rocks
that
interrupted
my
progress
and
baffled
my
doubtful
road
but
i
did
my
best
with
rapid
steps
i
swept
round
the
base
of
the
hills
threaded
the
winding
hollows
and
at
last
as
i
rose
in
my
swift
course
to
the
crest
of
a
lofty
ridge
thalatta
thalatta
by
jove
i
saw
the
sea
my
tongue
can
tell
where
to
find
a
clue
to
many
an
old
pagan
creed
because
that
distinctly
from
all
mere
admiration
of
the
beauty
belonging
to
nature
s
works
i
acknowledge
a
sense
of
mystical
reverence
when
first
i
look
to
see
some
illustrious
feature
of
the
coastline
of
ocean
some
mighty
river
or
dreary
mountain
range
the
ancient
barrier
of
kingdoms
but
the
red
sea
it
might
well
claim
my
earnest
gaze
by
force
of
the
great
jewish
migration
which
connects
it
with
the
history
of
our
own
religion
from
this
very
ridge
it
is
likely
enough
the
panting
israelites
first
saw
that
shining
inlet
of
the
sea
ay
ay
but
moreover
and
best
of
all
that
beckoning
sea
assured
my
eyes
and
proved
how
well
i
had
marked
out
the
east
for
my
path
and
gave
me
good
promise
that
sooner
or
later
the
time
would
come
for
me
to
rest
and
drink
it
was
distant
the
sea
but
i
felt
my
own
strength
and
i
had
of
the
strength
of
dromedaries
i
pushed
forward
as
eagerly
as
though
i
had
spoiled
the
egyptians
and
were
flying
from
pharaoh
s
police
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
discover
any
symptoms
of
suez
but
after
a
while
i
descried
in
the
distance
a
large
blank
isolated
building
i
made
towards
this
and
in
time
got
down
to
it
the
building
was
a
fort
and
had
been
built
there
for
the
protection
of
a
well
which
it
contained
within
its
precincts
a
cluster
of
small
huts
adhered
to
the
fort
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
receiving
the
hospitality
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
grouped
upon
the
sands
near
their
hamlet
to
quench
the
fires
of
my
throat
with
about
a
gallon
of
muddy
water
and
to
swallow
a
little
of
the
food
placed
before
me
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
and
before
the
astonishment
of
my
hosts
had
even
begun
to
subside
i
was
pursuing
my
onward
journey
suez
i
found
was
still
three
hours
distant
and
the
sun
going
down
in
the
west
warned
me
that
i
must
find
some
other
guide
to
keep
me
in
the
right
direction
this
guide
i
found
in
the
most
fickle
and
uncertain
of
the
elements
for
some
hours
the
wind
had
been
freshening
and
it
now
blew
a
violent
gale
it
blew
not
fitfully
and
in
squalls
but
with
such
remarkable
steadiness
that
i
felt
convinced
it
would
blow
from
the
same
quarter
for
several
hours
when
the
sun
set
therefore
i
carefully
looked
for
the
point
from
which
the
wind
was
blowing
and
found
that
it
came
from
the
very
west
and
was
blowing
exactly
in
the
direction
of
my
route
i
had
nothing
to
do
therefore
but
to
go
straight
to
leeward
and
this
was
not
difficult
for
the
gale
blew
with
such
immense
force
that
if
i
diverged
at
all
from
its
line
i
instantly
felt
the
pressure
of
the
blast
on
the
side
towards
which
i
was
deviating
very
soon
after
sunset
there
came
on
complete
darkness
but
the
strong
wind
guided
me
well
and
sped
me
too
on
my
way
i
had
pushed
on
for
about
i
think
a
couple
of
hours
after
nightfall
when
i
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
in
the
distance
and
this
i
ventured
to
hope
must
be
suez
upon
approaching
it
however
i
found
that
it
was
only
a
solitary
fort
and
i
passed
on
without
stopping
on
i
went
still
riding
down
the
wind
when
an
unlucky
accident
occurred
for
which
if
you
like
you
can
have
your
laugh
against
me
i
have
told
you
already
what
sort
of
lodging
it
is
that
you
have
upon
the
back
of
a
camel
you
ride
the
dromedary
in
the
same
fashion
you
are
perched
rather
than
seated
on
a
bunch
of
carpets
or
quilts
upon
the
summit
of
the
hump
it
happened
that
my
dromedary
veered
rather
suddenly
from
her
onward
course
meeting
the
movement
i
mechanically
turned
my
left
wrist
as
though
i
were
holding
a
for
the
complete
darkness
prevented
my
eyes
from
reminding
me
that
i
had
nothing
but
a
halter
in
my
hand
the
expected
resistance
failed
for
the
halter
was
hanging
upon
that
side
of
the
dromedary
s
neck
towards
which
i
was
slightly
leaning
i
toppled
over
head
foremost
and
then
went
falling
and
falling
through
air
till
my
crown
came
whang
against
the
ground
and
the
ground
too
was
perfectly
hard
compacted
sand
but
the
headgear
which
i
wore
for
protection
against
the
sun
saved
my
life
the
notion
of
my
being
able
to
get
up
again
after
falling
from
such
an
immense
height
seemed
to
me
at
first
too
paradoxical
to
be
acted
upon
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
not
a
bit
hurt
my
dromedary
utterly
vanished
i
looked
round
me
and
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
in
the
fort
which
i
had
lately
passed
and
i
began
to
work
my
way
back
in
that
direction
the
violence
of
the
gale
made
it
hard
for
me
to
force
my
way
towards
the
west
but
i
succeeded
at
last
in
regaining
the
fort
to
this
as
to
the
other
fort
which
i
had
passed
there
was
attached
a
cluster
of
huts
and
i
soon
found
myself
surrounded
by
a
group
of
villainous
fellows
it
was
a
horrid
bore
for
me
to
have
to
swagger
and
look
big
at
a
time
when
i
felt
so
particularly
small
on
account
of
my
tumble
and
my
lost
dromedary
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
no
dthemetri
now
to
strike
terror
for
me
i
knew
hardly
one
word
of
arabic
but
somehow
or
other
i
contrived
to
announce
it
as
my
absolute
will
and
pleasure
that
these
fellows
should
find
me
the
means
of
gaining
suez
they
acceded
and
having
a
donkey
they
saddled
it
for
me
and
appointed
one
of
their
number
to
attend
me
on
foot
i
afterwards
found
that
these
fellows
were
not
arabs
but
algerine
refugees
and
that
they
bore
the
character
of
being
sad
scoundrels
they
justified
this
imputation
to
some
extent
on
the
following
day
they
allowed
mysseri
with
my
baggage
and
the
camels
to
pass
unmolested
but
an
arab
lad
belonging
to
the
party
happened
to
lag
a
little
way
in
the
rear
and
him
if
they
were
not
maligned
these
rascals
stripped
and
robbed
low
indeed
is
the
state
of
bandit
morality
when
men
will
allow
the
sleek
traveller
with
camels
to
pass
in
quiet
reserving
their
spirit
of
enterprise
for
the
tattered
turban
of
a
miserable
boy
i
reached
suez
at
last
the
british
agent
though
roused
from
his
midnight
sleep
received
me
in
his
home
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
hospitality
oh
by
jove
how
delightful
it
was
to
lie
on
fair
sheets
and
to
dally
with
sleep
and
to
wake
and
to
sleep
and
to
wake
once
more
for
the
sake
of
sleeping
again
chapter
xxii
suez
i
was
hospitably
entertained
by
the
british
consul
or
agent
as
he
is
there
styled
he
is
the
of
the
east
india
company
and
not
of
the
home
government
napoleon
during
his
stay
of
five
days
at
suez
had
been
the
guest
of
the
consul
s
father
and
i
was
told
that
the
divan
in
my
apartment
had
been
the
bed
of
the
great
commander
there
are
two
opinions
as
to
the
point
at
which
the
israelites
passed
the
red
sea
one
is
that
they
traversed
only
the
very
small
creek
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
inlet
and
that
they
entered
the
bed
of
the
water
at
the
spot
on
which
suez
now
stands
the
other
that
they
crossed
the
sea
from
a
point
eighteen
miles
down
the
coast
the
oxford
theologians
who
with
milman
their
professor
believe
that
jehovah
conducted
his
chosen
people
without
disturbing
the
order
of
nature
adopt
the
first
view
and
suppose
that
the
israelites
passed
during
an
aided
by
a
violent
wind
one
among
many
objections
to
this
supposition
is
that
the
time
of
a
single
ebb
would
not
have
been
sufficient
for
the
passage
of
that
vast
multitude
of
men
and
beasts
or
even
for
a
small
fraction
of
it
moreover
the
creek
to
the
north
of
this
point
can
be
compassed
in
an
hour
and
in
two
hours
you
can
make
the
circuit
of
the
salt
marsh
over
which
the
sea
may
have
extended
in
former
times
if
therefore
the
israelites
crossed
so
high
up
as
suez
the
egyptians
unless
infatuated
by
divine
interference
might
easily
have
recovered
their
stolen
goods
from
the
encumbered
fugitives
by
making
a
slight
detour
the
opinion
which
fixes
the
point
of
passage
at
eighteen
miles
distance
and
from
thence
right
across
the
ocean
depths
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
sea
is
supported
by
the
unanimous
tradition
of
the
people
whether
christians
or
mussulmans
and
is
consistent
with
holy
writ
the
waters
were
a
wall
unto
them
on
their
right
hand
on
their
the
cambridge
mathematicians
seem
to
think
that
the
israelites
were
enabled
to
pass
over
dry
land
by
adopting
a
route
not
usually
subjected
to
the
influx
of
the
sea
this
notion
is
plausible
in
a
merely
hydrostatical
point
of
view
and
is
supposed
to
have
been
adopted
by
most
of
the
fellows
of
trinity
but
certainly
not
by
thorp
who
is
one
of
the
most
amiable
of
their
number
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
this
theory
with
the
account
given
in
exodus
unless
we
can
suppose
that
the
words
sea
and
waters
are
there
used
in
a
sense
implying
dry
land
napoleon
when
at
suez
made
an
attempt
to
follow
the
supposed
steps
of
moses
by
passing
the
creek
at
this
point
but
it
seems
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
people
at
suez
that
he
and
his
horsemen
managed
the
matter
in
a
way
more
resembling
the
failure
of
the
egyptians
than
the
success
of
the
israelites
according
to
the
french
account
napoleon
got
out
of
the
difficulty
by
that
presence
of
mind
which
served
him
so
well
when
the
fate
of
nations
depended
on
the
decision
of
a
ordered
his
horsemen
to
disperse
in
all
directions
in
order
to
multiply
the
chances
of
finding
shallow
water
and
was
thus
enabled
to
discover
a
line
by
which
he
and
his
people
were
extricated
the
story
told
by
the
people
of
suez
is
very
different
they
declare
that
napoleon
parted
from
his
horse
got
thoroughly
submerged
and
was
only
fished
out
by
the
assistance
of
the
people
on
shore
i
bathed
twice
at
the
point
assigned
to
the
passage
of
the
israelites
and
the
second
time
that
i
did
so
i
chose
the
time
of
low
water
and
tried
to
walk
across
but
i
soon
found
myself
out
of
my
depth
or
at
least
in
water
so
deep
that
i
could
only
advance
by
swimming
the
dromedary
which
had
bolted
in
the
desert
was
brought
into
suez
the
day
after
my
arrival
but
my
pelisse
and
my
pistols
which
had
been
attached
to
the
saddle
had
disappeared
these
articles
were
treasures
of
great
importance
to
me
at
that
time
and
i
moved
the
governor
of
the
town
to
make
all
possible
exertions
for
their
recovery
he
acceded
to
my
wishes
as
well
as
he
could
and
very
obligingly
imprisoned
the
first
seven
poor
fellows
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
at
first
the
governor
acted
in
the
matter
from
no
other
motive
than
that
of
courtesy
to
an
english
traveller
but
afterwards
and
when
he
saw
the
value
which
i
set
upon
the
lost
property
he
pushed
his
measures
with
a
degree
of
alacrity
and
heat
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
felt
a
personal
interest
in
the
matter
it
was
supposed
either
that
he
expected
a
large
present
in
the
event
of
succeeding
or
that
he
was
striving
by
all
means
to
trace
the
property
in
order
that
he
might
lay
his
hands
on
it
after
my
departure
i
went
out
sailing
for
some
hours
and
when
i
returned
i
was
horrified
to
find
that
two
men
had
been
bastinadoed
by
order
of
the
governor
with
a
view
to
force
them
to
a
confession
of
their
theft
it
appeared
however
that
there
really
was
good
ground
for
supposing
them
guilty
since
one
of
the
holsters
was
actually
found
in
their
possession
it
was
said
too
but
i
could
hardly
believe
it
that
whilst
one
of
the
men
was
undergoing
the
bastinado
his
comrade
was
overhead
encouraging
him
to
bear
the
torment
without
peaching
both
men
if
they
had
the
secret
were
resolute
in
keeping
it
and
were
sent
back
to
their
dungeon
i
of
course
took
care
that
there
should
be
no
repetition
of
the
torture
at
least
so
long
as
i
remained
at
suez
the
governor
was
a
thorough
oriental
and
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
had
shared
in
the
old
mahometan
feeling
of
contempt
for
europeans
it
happened
however
one
day
that
an
english
had
appeared
off
suez
and
sent
her
boats
ashore
to
take
in
fresh
water
now
fresh
water
at
suez
is
a
somewhat
scarce
and
precious
commodity
it
is
kept
in
tanks
the
chief
of
which
is
at
some
distance
from
the
place
under
these
circumstances
the
request
for
fresh
water
was
refused
or
at
all
events
was
not
complied
with
the
captain
of
the
brig
was
a
man
with
a
strongish
will
and
he
at
once
declared
that
if
his
casks
were
not
filled
in
three
hours
he
would
destroy
the
whole
place
a
great
people
indeed
said
the
governor
a
wonderful
people
the
english
he
instantly
caused
every
cask
to
be
filled
to
the
brim
from
his
own
tank
and
ever
afterwards
entertained
for
the
english
a
degree
of
affection
and
respect
for
which
i
felt
infinitely
indebted
to
the
gallant
captain
the
day
after
the
abortive
attempt
to
extract
a
confession
from
the
prisoners
the
governor
the
consul
and
i
sat
in
council
i
know
not
how
long
with
a
view
of
prosecuting
the
search
for
the
stolen
goods
the
sitting
considered
in
the
light
of
a
criminal
investigation
was
characteristic
of
the
east
the
proceedings
began
as
a
matter
of
course
by
the
prosecutor
s
smoking
a
pipe
and
drinking
coffee
with
the
governor
who
was
judge
jury
and
sheriff
i
got
on
very
well
with
him
this
was
not
my
first
interview
and
he
gave
me
the
pipe
from
his
lips
in
testimony
of
his
friendship
i
recollect
however
that
my
prime
adviser
thinking
me
i
suppose
a
great
deal
too
shy
and
retiring
in
my
manner
entreated
me
to
put
up
my
boots
and
to
soil
the
governor
s
divan
in
order
to
inspire
respect
and
strike
terror
i
thought
it
would
be
as
well
for
me
to
retain
the
right
of
respecting
myself
and
that
it
was
not
quite
necessary
for
a
guest
to
strike
any
terror
at
all
our
deliberations
were
assisted
by
the
numerous
attendants
who
lined
the
three
sides
of
the
room
not
occupied
by
the
divan
any
one
of
these
who
took
it
into
his
head
to
offer
a
suggestion
would
stand
forward
and
humble
himself
before
the
governor
and
then
state
his
views
every
man
thus
giving
counsel
was
listened
to
with
some
attention
after
a
great
deal
of
fruitless
planning
the
governor
directed
that
the
prisoners
should
be
brought
in
i
was
shocked
when
they
entered
for
i
was
not
prepared
to
see
them
come
into
the
room
upon
the
shoulders
of
others
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
their
battered
feet
would
be
too
sore
to
bear
the
contact
of
the
floor
they
persisted
in
asserting
their
innocence
the
governor
wanted
to
recur
to
the
torture
but
that
i
prevented
and
the
men
were
carried
back
to
their
dungeon
a
scheme
was
now
suggested
by
one
of
the
attendants
which
seemed
to
me
childishly
absurd
but
it
was
nevertheless
tried
the
plan
was
to
send
a
man
to
the
prisoners
who
was
to
make
them
believe
that
he
had
obtained
entrance
into
their
dungeon
upon
some
other
pretence
but
that
he
had
in
reality
come
to
treat
with
them
for
the
purchase
of
the
stolen
goods
this
shallow
expedient
of
course
failed
the
governor
himself
had
not
nominally
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
the
people
in
his
district
but
he
could
if
he
chose
send
them
to
cairo
and
have
them
hanged
there
i
proposed
therefore
that
the
prisoners
should
be
with
this
fate
the
answer
of
the
governor
made
me
feel
rather
ashamed
of
my
effeminate
suggestion
he
said
that
if
i
wished
it
he
would
willingly
threaten
them
with
death
but
he
also
said
that
if
he
threatened
should
execute
the
thinking
at
last
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
keeping
the
prisoners
any
longer
in
confinement
i
requested
that
they
might
be
set
free
to
this
the
governor
acceded
though
only
as
he
said
out
of
favour
to
me
for
he
had
a
strong
impression
that
the
men
were
guilty
i
went
down
to
see
the
prisoners
let
out
with
my
own
eyes
they
were
very
grateful
and
fell
down
to
the
earth
kissing
my
boots
i
gave
them
a
present
to
console
them
for
their
wounds
and
they
seemed
to
be
highly
delighted
although
the
matter
terminated
in
a
manner
so
satisfactory
to
the
principal
sufferers
there
were
symptoms
of
some
angry
excitement
in
the
place
it
was
said
that
public
opinion
was
much
shocked
at
the
fact
that
mahometans
had
been
beaten
on
account
of
a
loss
sustained
by
a
christian
my
journey
was
to
recommence
the
next
day
and
it
was
hinted
that
if
i
persevered
in
my
intention
of
proceeding
the
people
would
have
an
easy
and
profitable
opportunity
of
wreaking
their
vengeance
on
me
if
ever
they
formed
any
scheme
of
the
kind
they
at
all
events
refrained
from
any
attempt
to
carry
it
into
effect
one
of
the
evenings
during
my
stay
at
suez
was
enlivened
by
a
triple
wedding
there
was
a
long
and
slow
procession
some
carried
torches
and
others
were
thumping
drums
and
firing
pistols
the
bridegrooms
came
last
all
walking
abreast
my
only
reason
for
mentioning
the
ceremony
which
was
otherwise
uninteresting
is
that
i
scarcely
ever
in
all
my
life
saw
any
phenomena
so
ridiculous
as
the
meekness
and
gravity
of
those
three
young
men
whilst
being
led
to
the
chapter
xxiii
suez
to
gaza
the
route
over
the
desert
from
suez
to
gaza
is
not
frequented
by
merchants
and
is
seldom
passed
by
a
traveller
this
part
of
the
country
is
less
uniformly
barren
than
the
tracts
of
shifting
sand
that
lie
on
the
el
arish
route
the
shrubs
on
which
the
camel
feeds
are
more
frequent
and
in
many
spots
the
sand
is
mingled
with
so
much
of
productive
soil
as
to
admit
the
growth
of
corn
the
bedouins
are
driven
out
of
this
district
during
the
summer
by
the
total
want
of
water
but
before
the
time
for
their
forced
departure
arrives
they
succeed
in
raising
little
crops
of
barley
from
these
comparatively
fertile
patches
of
ground
they
bury
the
fruit
of
their
labours
leaving
marks
by
which
upon
their
return
they
may
be
able
to
recognise
the
spot
the
warm
dry
sand
stands
them
for
a
safe
granary
the
country
at
the
time
i
passed
it
in
the
month
of
april
was
pretty
thickly
sprinkled
with
bedouins
expecting
their
harvest
several
times
my
tent
was
pitched
alongside
of
their
encampments
i
have
told
you
already
what
the
impressions
were
which
these
people
produced
upon
my
mind
i
saw
several
creatures
of
the
antelope
kind
in
this
part
of
the
desert
and
one
day
my
arabs
surprised
in
her
sleep
a
young
gazelle
for
so
i
called
her
and
took
the
darling
prisoner
i
carried
her
before
me
on
my
camel
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
kept
her
in
my
tent
all
night
i
did
all
i
could
to
coax
her
but
the
trembling
beauty
refused
to
touch
food
and
would
not
be
comforted
whenever
she
had
a
seeming
opportunity
of
escaping
she
struggled
with
a
violence
so
painfully
disproportioned
to
her
fine
delicate
limbs
that
i
could
not
continue
the
cruel
attempt
to
make
her
my
own
in
the
morning
therefore
i
set
her
free
anticipating
some
pleasure
from
seeing
the
joyous
bound
with
which
as
i
thought
she
would
return
to
her
native
freedom
she
had
been
so
stupefied
however
by
the
exciting
events
of
the
preceding
day
and
night
and
was
so
puzzled
as
to
the
road
she
should
take
that
she
went
off
very
deliberately
and
with
an
uncertain
step
she
went
away
quite
sound
in
limb
but
her
intellect
may
have
been
upset
never
in
all
likelihood
had
she
seen
the
form
of
a
human
being
until
the
dreadful
moment
when
she
woke
from
her
sleep
and
found
herself
in
the
grip
of
an
arab
then
her
pitching
and
tossing
journey
on
the
back
of
a
camel
and
lastly
a
with
me
by
candlelight
i
should
have
been
glad
to
know
if
i
could
that
her
heart
was
not
utterly
broken
my
arabs
were
somewhat
excited
one
day
by
discovering
the
fresh
print
of
a
foot
as
they
said
of
a
lion
i
had
no
conception
that
the
lord
of
the
forest
better
known
as
a
crest
ever
stalked
away
from
his
jungles
to
make
inglorious
war
in
these
smooth
plains
against
antelopes
and
gazelles
i
supposed
that
there
must
have
been
some
error
of
interpretation
and
that
the
arabs
meant
to
speak
of
a
tiger
it
appeared
however
that
this
was
not
the
case
either
the
arabs
were
mistaken
or
the
noble
brute
uncooped
and
unchained
had
but
lately
crossed
my
path
the
camels
with
which
i
traversed
this
part
of
the
desert
were
very
different
in
their
ways
and
habits
from
those
that
you
get
on
a
frequented
route
they
were
never
led
there
was
not
the
slightest
sign
of
a
track
in
this
part
of
the
desert
but
the
camels
never
failed
to
choose
the
right
line
by
the
direction
taken
at
starting
they
knew
i
suppose
the
point
some
encampment
for
which
they
were
to
make
there
is
always
a
leading
camel
generally
i
believe
the
eldest
who
marches
foremost
and
determines
the
path
for
the
whole
party
if
it
happens
that
no
one
of
the
camels
has
been
accustomed
to
lead
the
others
there
is
very
great
difficulty
in
making
a
start
if
you
force
your
beast
forward
for
a
moment
he
will
contrive
to
wheel
and
draw
back
at
the
same
time
looking
at
one
of
the
other
camels
with
an
expression
and
gesture
exactly
equivalent
to
the
responsibility
of
finding
the
way
is
evidently
assumed
very
unwillingly
after
some
time
however
it
becomes
understood
that
one
of
the
beasts
has
reluctantly
consented
to
take
the
lead
and
he
accordingly
advances
for
that
purpose
for
a
minute
or
two
he
goes
on
with
much
indecision
taking
first
one
line
and
then
another
but
soon
by
the
aid
of
some
mysterious
sense
he
discovers
the
true
direction
and
follows
it
steadily
from
morning
to
night
when
once
the
leadership
is
established
you
can
not
by
any
persuasion
and
can
scarcely
by
any
force
induce
a
junior
camel
to
walk
one
single
step
in
advance
of
the
chosen
guide
on
the
fifth
day
i
came
to
an
oasis
called
the
wady
el
arish
a
ravine
or
rather
a
gully
through
which
during
a
part
of
the
year
there
runs
a
stream
of
water
on
the
sides
of
the
gully
there
were
a
number
of
those
graceful
trees
which
the
arabs
call
the
channel
of
the
stream
was
quite
dry
in
the
part
at
which
we
arrived
but
at
about
half
a
mile
off
some
water
was
found
which
though
very
muddy
was
tolerably
sweet
this
was
a
happy
discovery
for
all
the
water
that
we
had
brought
from
the
neighbourhood
of
suez
was
rapidly
putrefying
the
want
of
foresight
is
an
anomalous
part
of
the
bedouin
s
character
for
it
does
not
result
either
from
recklessness
or
stupidity
i
know
of
no
human
being
whose
body
is
so
thoroughly
the
slave
of
mind
as
that
of
the
arab
his
mental
anxieties
seem
to
be
for
ever
torturing
every
nerve
and
fibre
of
his
body
and
yet
with
all
this
exquisite
sensitiveness
to
the
suggestions
of
the
mind
he
is
grossly
improvident
i
recollect
for
instance
that
when
setting
out
upon
this
passage
of
the
desert
my
arabs
in
order
to
lighten
the
burthen
of
their
camels
were
most
anxious
that
we
should
take
with
us
only
two
days
supply
of
water
they
said
that
by
the
time
that
supply
was
exhausted
we
should
arrive
at
a
spring
which
would
furnish
us
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
my
servants
very
wisely
and
with
much
pertinacity
resisted
the
adoption
of
this
plan
and
took
care
to
have
both
the
large
skins
well
filled
we
proceeded
and
found
no
water
at
all
either
at
the
expected
spring
or
for
many
days
afterwards
so
that
nothing
but
the
precaution
of
my
own
people
saved
us
from
the
very
severe
suffering
which
we
should
have
endured
if
we
had
entered
upon
the
desert
with
only
a
two
days
supply
the
arabs
themselves
being
on
foot
would
have
suffered
much
more
than
i
from
the
consequences
of
their
improvidence
this
unaccountable
want
of
foresight
prevents
the
bedouin
from
appreciating
at
a
distance
of
eight
or
ten
days
the
amount
of
the
misery
which
he
entails
upon
himself
at
the
end
of
that
period
his
dread
of
a
city
is
one
of
the
most
painful
mental
affections
that
i
have
ever
observed
and
yet
when
the
whole
breadth
of
the
desert
lies
between
him
and
the
town
to
which
you
are
going
he
will
freely
enter
into
an
agreement
to
you
in
the
city
for
which
you
are
bound
when
however
after
many
a
day
of
toil
the
distant
minarets
at
length
appear
the
poor
bedouin
relaxes
the
vigour
of
his
pace
his
steps
become
faltering
and
undecided
every
moment
his
uneasiness
increases
and
at
length
he
fairly
sobs
aloud
and
embracing
your
knees
implores
with
the
most
piteous
cries
and
gestures
that
you
will
dispense
with
him
and
his
camels
and
find
some
other
means
of
entering
the
city
this
of
course
one
can
t
agree
to
and
the
consequence
is
that
one
is
obliged
to
witness
and
resist
the
most
moving
expressions
of
grief
and
fond
entreaty
i
had
to
go
through
a
most
painful
scene
of
this
kind
when
i
entered
cairo
and
now
the
horror
which
these
wilder
arabs
felt
at
the
notion
of
entering
gaza
led
to
consequences
still
more
distressing
the
dread
of
cities
results
partly
from
a
kind
of
wild
instinct
which
has
always
characterised
the
descendants
of
ishmael
but
partly
too
from
a
apprehension
of
so
often
it
happens
that
the
poor
bedouin
when
once
jammed
in
between
walls
is
seized
by
the
government
authorities
for
the
sake
of
his
camels
that
his
innate
horror
of
cities
becomes
really
justified
by
results
the
bedouins
with
whom
i
performed
this
journey
were
wild
fellows
of
the
desert
quite
unaccustomed
to
let
out
themselves
or
their
beasts
for
hire
and
when
they
found
that
by
the
natural
ascendency
of
europeans
they
were
gradually
brought
down
to
a
state
of
subserviency
to
me
or
rather
to
my
attendants
they
bitterly
repented
i
believe
of
having
placed
themselves
under
our
control
they
were
rather
difficult
fellows
to
manage
and
gave
dthemetri
a
good
deal
of
trouble
but
i
liked
them
all
the
better
for
that
selim
the
chief
of
the
party
and
the
man
to
whom
all
our
camels
belonged
was
a
fine
savage
stately
fellow
there
were
i
think
five
other
arabs
of
the
party
but
when
we
approached
the
end
of
the
journey
they
one
by
one
began
to
make
off
towards
the
neighbouring
encampments
and
by
the
time
that
the
minarets
of
gaza
were
in
sight
selim
the
owner
of
the
camels
was
the
only
one
who
remained
he
poor
fellow
as
we
neared
the
town
began
to
discover
the
same
terrors
that
my
arabs
had
shown
when
i
entered
cairo
i
could
not
possibly
accede
to
his
entreaties
and
consent
to
let
my
baggage
be
laid
down
on
the
bare
sands
without
any
means
of
having
it
brought
on
into
the
city
so
at
length
when
poor
selim
had
exhausted
all
his
rhetoric
of
voice
and
action
and
tears
he
fixed
his
despairing
eyes
for
a
minute
upon
the
cherished
beasts
that
were
his
only
wealth
and
then
suddenly
and
madly
dashed
away
into
the
farther
desert
i
continued
my
course
and
reached
the
city
at
last
but
it
was
not
without
immense
difficulty
that
we
could
constrain
the
poor
camels
to
pass
under
the
hated
shadow
of
its
walls
they
were
the
genuine
beasts
of
the
desert
and
it
was
sad
and
painful
to
witness
the
agony
they
suffered
when
thus
they
were
forced
to
encounter
the
fixed
habitations
of
men
they
shrank
from
the
beginning
of
every
high
narrow
street
as
though
from
the
entrance
of
some
horrible
cave
or
bottomless
pit
they
sighed
and
wept
like
women
when
at
last
we
got
them
within
the
courtyard
of
the
khan
they
seemed
to
be
quite
and
looked
round
piteously
for
their
loving
master
but
no
selim
came
i
had
imagined
that
he
would
enter
the
town
secretly
by
night
in
order
to
carry
off
those
five
fine
camels
his
only
wealth
in
this
world
and
seemingly
the
main
objects
of
his
affection
but
no
his
dread
of
civilisation
was
too
strong
during
the
whole
of
the
three
days
that
i
remained
at
gaza
he
failed
to
show
himself
and
thus
sacrificed
in
all
probability
not
only
his
camels
but
the
money
which
i
had
stipulated
to
pay
him
for
the
passage
of
the
desert
in
order
however
to
do
all
i
could
towards
saving
him
from
this
last
misfortune
i
resorted
to
a
contrivance
frequently
adopted
by
the
asiatics
i
assembled
a
group
of
grave
and
worthy
mussulmans
in
the
courtyard
of
the
khan
and
in
their
presence
paid
over
the
gold
to
a
sheik
who
was
accustomed
to
communicate
with
the
arabs
of
the
desert
all
present
solemnly
promised
that
if
ever
selim
should
come
to
claim
his
rights
they
would
bear
true
witness
in
his
favour
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
my
old
friend
the
governor
of
gaza
he
had
received
orders
to
send
back
all
persons
coming
from
egypt
and
force
them
to
perform
quarantine
at
el
arish
he
knew
so
little
of
quarantine
regulations
however
that
his
dress
was
actually
in
contact
with
mine
whilst
he
insisted
upon
the
stringency
of
the
orders
which
he
had
received
he
was
induced
to
make
an
exception
in
my
favour
and
i
rewarded
him
with
a
musical
which
i
had
bought
at
smyrna
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
it
to
any
man
in
authority
who
might
happen
to
do
me
an
important
service
the
governor
was
delighted
with
his
toy
and
took
it
off
to
his
harem
with
great
exultation
he
soon
however
returned
with
an
altered
countenance
his
wives
he
said
had
got
hold
of
the
box
and
put
it
out
of
order
so
shortlived
is
human
happiness
in
this
frail
world
the
governor
fancied
that
he
should
incur
less
risk
if
i
remained
at
gaza
for
two
or
three
days
more
and
he
wanted
me
to
become
his
guest
i
persuaded
him
however
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
let
me
depart
at
once
he
wanted
to
add
to
my
baggage
a
roast
lamb
and
a
quantity
of
other
cumbrous
viands
but
i
escaped
with
half
a
of
leaven
bread
which
was
very
good
of
its
kind
and
proved
a
most
useful
present
the
air
with
which
the
governor
s
slaves
affected
to
be
almost
breaking
down
under
the
weight
of
the
gifts
which
they
bore
on
their
shoulders
reminded
me
of
the
figures
one
sees
in
some
of
the
old
pictures
chapter
xxiv
gaza
to
nablus
passing
now
once
again
through
palestine
and
syria
i
retained
the
tent
which
i
had
used
in
the
desert
and
found
that
it
added
very
much
to
my
comfort
in
travelling
instead
of
turning
out
a
family
from
some
wretched
dwelling
and
depriving
them
of
a
repose
which
i
was
sure
not
to
find
for
myself
i
now
when
evening
came
pitched
my
tent
upon
some
smiling
spot
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
village
to
which
i
looked
for
my
supplies
that
is
for
milk
and
bread
if
i
had
it
not
with
me
and
sometimes
also
for
eggs
the
worst
of
it
is
that
the
needful
viands
are
not
to
be
obtained
by
coin
but
only
by
intimidation
i
at
first
tried
the
usual
agent
money
dthemetri
with
one
or
two
of
my
arabs
went
into
the
village
near
which
i
was
encamped
and
tried
to
buy
the
required
provisions
offering
liberal
payment
but
he
came
back
i
sent
him
again
but
this
time
he
held
different
language
he
required
to
see
the
elders
of
the
place
and
threatening
dreadful
vengeance
directed
them
upon
their
responsibility
to
take
care
that
my
tent
should
be
immediately
and
abundantly
supplied
he
was
obeyed
at
once
and
the
provisions
refused
to
me
as
a
purchaser
soon
arrived
trebled
or
quadrupled
when
demanded
by
way
of
a
forced
contribution
i
quickly
found
i
think
it
required
two
experiments
to
convince
me
that
this
peremptory
method
was
the
only
one
which
could
be
adopted
with
success
it
never
failed
of
course
however
when
the
provisions
have
been
actually
obtained
you
can
if
you
choose
give
money
exceeding
the
value
of
the
provisions
to
somebody
an
english
a
thoroughbred
english
traveller
will
always
do
this
though
it
is
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
country
for
the
quiet
false
quiet
though
it
be
of
his
own
conscience
but
so
to
order
the
matter
that
the
poor
fellows
who
have
been
forced
to
contribute
should
be
the
persons
to
receive
the
value
of
their
supplies
is
not
possible
for
a
traveller
to
attempt
anything
so
grossly
just
as
that
would
be
too
outrageous
the
truth
is
that
the
usage
of
the
east
in
old
times
required
the
people
of
the
village
at
their
own
cost
to
supply
the
wants
of
travellers
and
the
ancient
custom
is
now
adhered
to
not
in
favour
of
travellers
generally
but
in
favour
of
those
who
are
deemed
sufficiently
powerful
to
enforce
its
observance
if
the
villagers
therefore
find
a
man
waiving
this
right
to
oppress
them
and
offering
coin
for
that
which
he
is
entitled
to
take
without
payment
they
suppose
at
once
that
he
is
actuated
by
fear
fear
of
poor
fellows
and
it
is
so
delightful
to
them
to
act
upon
this
flattering
assumption
that
they
will
forego
the
advantage
of
a
good
price
for
their
provisions
rather
than
the
rare
luxury
of
refusing
for
once
in
their
lives
to
part
with
their
own
possessions
the
practice
of
intimidation
thus
rendered
necessary
is
utterly
hateful
to
an
englishman
he
finds
himself
forced
to
conquer
his
daily
bread
by
the
pompous
threats
of
the
dragoman
his
very
subsistence
as
well
as
his
dignity
and
personal
safety
being
made
to
depend
upon
his
servant
s
assuming
a
tone
of
authority
which
does
not
at
all
belong
to
him
besides
he
can
scarcely
fail
to
see
that
as
he
passes
through
the
country
he
becomes
the
innocent
cause
of
much
extra
injustice
many
supernumerary
wrongs
this
he
feels
to
be
especially
the
case
when
he
travels
with
relays
to
be
the
owner
of
a
horse
or
a
mule
within
reach
of
an
asiatic
potentate
is
to
lead
the
life
of
the
hare
and
the
rabbit
hunted
down
and
ferreted
out
too
often
it
happens
that
the
works
of
the
field
are
stopped
in
the
daytime
that
the
inmates
of
the
cottage
are
roused
from
their
midnight
sleep
by
the
sudden
coming
of
a
government
officer
and
the
poor
husbandman
driven
by
threats
and
rewarded
by
curses
if
he
would
not
lose
sight
for
ever
of
his
captured
beasts
must
quit
all
and
follow
them
this
is
done
that
the
englishman
may
travel
he
would
make
his
way
more
harmless
if
he
could
but
horses
or
mules
he
have
and
these
are
his
ways
and
means
the
town
of
nablus
is
beautiful
it
lies
in
a
valley
hemmed
in
with
olive
groves
and
its
buildings
are
interspersed
with
frequent
it
is
said
to
occupy
the
site
of
the
ancient
sychem
i
know
not
whether
it
was
there
indeed
that
the
father
of
the
jews
was
accustomed
to
feed
his
flocks
but
the
valley
is
green
and
smiling
and
is
held
at
this
day
by
a
race
more
brave
and
beautiful
than
jacob
s
unhappy
descendants
nablus
is
the
very
furnace
of
mahometan
bigotry
and
i
believe
that
only
a
few
months
before
the
time
of
my
going
there
it
would
have
been
quite
unsafe
for
a
man
unless
strongly
guarded
to
show
himself
to
the
people
of
the
town
in
a
frank
costume
but
since
their
last
insurrection
the
mahometans
of
the
place
had
been
so
far
subdued
by
the
severity
of
ibrahim
pasha
that
they
dared
not
now
offer
the
slightest
insult
to
a
european
it
was
quite
plain
however
that
the
effort
with
which
the
men
of
the
old
school
refrained
from
expressing
their
opinion
of
a
hat
and
a
coat
was
horribly
painful
to
them
as
i
walked
through
the
streets
and
bazaars
a
dead
silence
prevailed
every
man
suspended
his
employment
and
gazed
on
me
with
a
fixed
glassy
look
which
seemed
to
say
god
is
good
but
how
marvellous
and
inscrutable
are
his
ways
that
thus
he
permits
this
dog
of
a
christian
to
hunt
through
the
paths
of
the
the
insurrection
of
these
people
had
been
more
formidable
than
any
other
that
ibrahim
pasha
had
to
contend
with
he
was
only
able
to
crush
them
at
last
by
the
assistance
of
a
fellow
renowned
for
his
resources
in
the
way
of
stratagem
and
cunning
as
well
as
for
his
knowledge
of
the
country
this
personage
was
no
other
than
aboo
goosh
the
father
of
lies
who
was
taken
out
of
prison
for
the
purpose
the
father
of
lies
enabled
ibrahim
to
hem
in
the
insurrection
and
extinguish
it
he
was
rewarded
with
the
governorship
of
jerusalem
which
he
held
when
i
was
there
i
recollect
by
the
by
that
he
tried
one
of
his
stratagems
upon
me
i
did
not
go
to
see
him
as
i
ought
in
courtesy
to
have
done
during
my
stay
at
jerusalem
but
i
happened
to
be
the
owner
of
a
rather
handsome
amber
piece
which
the
governor
heard
of
and
by
some
means
contrived
to
see
he
sent
to
me
and
dressed
up
a
statement
that
he
would
give
me
a
price
immensely
exceeding
the
sum
which
i
had
given
for
it
he
did
not
add
my
to
the
rest
of
his
trophies
there
was
a
small
number
of
greek
christians
resident
in
nablus
and
over
these
the
mussulmans
held
a
high
hand
not
even
permitting
them
to
speak
to
each
other
in
the
open
streets
but
if
the
moslems
thus
set
themselves
above
the
poor
christians
of
the
place
i
or
rather
my
servants
soon
took
the
ascendant
over
i
recollect
that
just
as
we
were
starting
from
the
place
and
at
a
time
when
a
number
of
people
had
gathered
together
in
the
main
street
to
see
our
preparations
mysseri
being
provoked
at
some
piece
of
perverseness
on
the
part
of
a
true
believer
coolly
thrashed
him
with
his
horsewhip
before
the
assembled
crowd
of
fanatics
i
was
much
annoyed
at
the
time
for
i
thought
that
the
people
would
probably
rise
against
us
they
turned
rather
pale
but
stood
still
the
day
of
my
arrival
at
nablus
was
a
s
day
of
the
mussulmans
most
of
the
people
were
amusing
themselves
in
the
beautiful
lawns
and
shady
groves
without
the
city
the
men
except
myself
were
all
remotely
apart
from
the
other
sex
the
women
in
groups
were
diverting
themselves
and
their
children
with
swings
they
were
so
handsome
that
they
could
not
keep
up
their
yashmaks
i
believe
that
they
had
never
before
looked
upon
a
man
in
the
european
dress
and
when
they
now
saw
in
me
that
strange
phenomenon
and
saw
too
how
they
could
please
the
creature
by
showing
him
a
glimpse
of
beauty
they
seemed
to
think
it
was
better
fun
to
do
this
than
to
go
on
playing
with
swings
it
was
always
however
with
a
sort
of
zoological
expression
of
countenance
that
they
looked
on
the
horrible
monster
from
europe
and
whenever
one
of
them
gave
me
to
see
for
one
sweet
instant
the
blushing
of
her
unveiled
face
it
was
with
the
same
kind
of
air
as
that
with
which
a
young
timid
girl
will
edge
her
way
up
to
an
elephant
and
tremblingly
give
him
a
nut
from
the
tips
of
her
rosy
fingers
chapter
xxv
mariam
there
is
no
spirit
of
propagandism
in
the
mussulmans
of
the
ottoman
dominions
true
it
is
that
a
prisoner
of
war
or
a
christian
condemned
to
death
may
on
some
occasions
save
his
life
by
adopting
the
religion
of
mahomet
but
instances
of
this
kind
are
now
exceedingly
rare
and
are
quite
at
variance
with
the
general
system
many
europeans
i
think
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
which
is
nevertheless
quite
true
namely
that
an
attempt
to
disturb
the
religious
repose
of
the
empire
by
the
conversion
of
a
christian
to
the
mahometan
faith
is
positively
illegal
the
event
which
now
i
am
going
to
mention
shows
plainly
enough
that
the
unlawfulness
of
such
interference
is
distinctly
recognised
even
in
the
most
bigoted
stronghold
of
islam
during
my
stay
at
nablus
i
took
up
my
quarters
at
the
house
of
the
greek
papa
as
he
is
called
that
is
the
greek
priest
the
priest
himself
had
gone
to
jerusalem
upon
the
business
i
am
going
to
tell
you
of
but
his
wife
remained
at
nablus
and
did
the
honours
of
her
home
soon
after
my
arrival
a
deputation
from
the
greek
christians
of
the
place
came
to
request
my
interference
in
a
matter
which
had
occasioned
vast
excitement
and
now
i
must
tell
you
how
it
came
to
happen
as
it
did
continually
that
people
thought
it
worth
while
to
claim
the
assistance
of
a
mere
traveller
who
was
totally
devoid
of
all
just
pretensions
to
authority
or
influence
of
even
the
humblest
description
and
especially
i
must
explain
to
you
how
it
was
that
the
power
thus
attributed
did
really
belong
to
me
or
rather
to
my
dragoman
successive
political
convulsions
had
at
length
fairly
loosed
the
people
of
syria
from
their
former
rules
of
conduct
and
from
all
their
old
habits
of
reliance
the
violence
and
success
with
which
mehemet
ali
crushed
the
insurrection
of
the
mahometan
population
had
utterly
beaten
down
the
head
of
islam
and
extinguished
for
the
time
at
least
those
virtues
and
vices
which
had
sprung
from
the
mahometan
faith
success
so
complete
as
mehemet
ali
s
if
it
had
been
attained
by
an
ordinary
asiatic
potentate
would
have
induced
a
notion
of
stability
the
readily
bowing
mind
of
the
oriental
would
have
bowed
low
and
long
under
the
feet
of
a
conqueror
whom
god
had
thus
strengthened
but
syria
was
no
field
for
contests
strictly
asiatic
europe
was
involved
and
though
the
heavy
masses
of
egyptian
troops
clinging
with
strong
grip
to
the
land
might
seem
to
hold
it
fast
yet
every
peasant
practically
felt
and
knew
that
in
vienna
or
petersburg
or
london
there
were
four
or
five
men
who
could
pull
down
the
star
of
the
pasha
with
shreds
of
paper
and
ink
the
people
of
the
country
knew
too
that
mehemet
ali
was
strong
with
the
strength
of
the
by
his
french
general
his
french
tactics
and
his
english
engines
moreover
they
saw
that
the
person
the
property
and
even
the
dignity
of
the
humblest
european
was
guarded
with
the
most
careful
solicitude
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
the
people
of
syria
looked
vaguely
but
confidently
to
europe
for
fresh
changes
many
would
fix
upon
some
nation
france
or
england
and
steadfastly
regard
it
as
the
arriving
sovereign
of
syria
those
whose
minds
remained
in
doubt
equally
contributed
to
this
new
state
of
public
opinion
which
no
longer
depended
upon
religion
and
ancient
habits
but
upon
bare
hopes
and
fears
every
man
wanted
to
know
not
who
was
his
neighbour
but
who
was
to
be
his
ruler
whose
feet
he
was
to
kiss
and
by
whom
feet
were
to
be
ultimately
beaten
treat
your
friend
says
the
proverb
as
though
he
were
one
day
to
become
your
enemy
and
your
enemy
as
though
he
were
one
day
to
become
your
friend
the
syrians
went
further
and
seemed
inclined
to
treat
every
stranger
as
though
he
might
one
day
become
their
pasha
such
was
the
state
of
circumstances
and
of
feeling
which
now
for
the
first
time
had
thoroughly
opened
the
mind
of
western
asia
for
the
reception
of
europeans
and
european
ideas
the
credit
of
the
english
especially
was
so
great
that
a
good
mussulman
flying
from
the
conscription
or
any
other
persecution
would
come
to
seek
from
the
formerly
despised
hat
that
protection
which
the
turban
could
no
longer
afford
and
a
man
high
in
authority
as
for
instance
the
governor
in
command
of
gaza
would
think
that
he
had
won
a
prize
or
at
all
events
a
valuable
lottery
ticket
if
he
obtained
a
written
approval
of
his
conduct
from
a
simple
traveller
still
in
order
that
any
immediate
result
should
follow
from
all
this
unwonted
readiness
in
the
asiatic
to
succumb
to
the
european
it
was
necessary
that
someone
should
be
at
hand
who
could
see
and
would
push
the
advantage
i
myself
had
neither
the
inclination
nor
the
power
to
do
so
but
it
happened
that
dthemetri
who
as
my
dragoman
represented
me
on
all
occasions
was
the
very
person
of
all
others
best
fitted
to
avail
himself
with
success
of
this
yielding
tendency
in
the
oriental
mind
if
the
chance
of
birth
and
fortune
had
made
poor
dthemetri
a
tailor
during
some
part
of
his
life
yet
religion
and
the
literature
of
the
church
which
he
served
had
made
him
a
man
and
a
brave
man
too
the
lives
of
saints
with
which
he
was
familiar
were
full
of
heroic
actions
provoking
imitation
and
since
faith
in
a
creed
involves
a
faith
in
its
ultimate
triumph
dthemetri
was
bold
from
a
sense
of
true
strength
his
education
too
though
not
very
general
in
its
character
had
been
carried
quite
far
enough
to
justify
him
in
pluming
himself
upon
a
very
decided
advantage
over
the
great
bulk
of
the
mahometan
population
including
the
men
in
authority
with
all
this
consciousness
of
religious
and
intellectual
superiority
dthemetri
had
lived
for
the
most
part
in
countries
lying
under
mussulman
governments
and
had
witnessed
perhaps
too
had
suffered
from
their
revolting
cruelties
the
result
was
that
he
abhorred
and
despised
the
mahometan
faith
and
all
who
clung
to
it
and
this
hate
was
not
of
the
dry
dull
and
inactive
sort
dthemetri
was
in
his
sphere
a
true
crusader
and
whenever
there
appeared
a
fair
opening
in
the
defences
of
islam
he
was
ready
and
eager
to
make
the
assault
these
sentiments
backed
by
a
consciousness
of
understanding
the
people
with
whom
he
had
to
do
made
dthemetri
not
only
firm
and
resolute
in
his
constant
interviews
with
men
in
authority
but
sometimes
also
as
you
may
know
already
very
violent
and
even
insulting
this
tone
which
i
always
disliked
though
i
was
fain
to
profit
by
it
invariably
succeeded
it
swept
away
all
resistance
there
was
nothing
in
the
then
depressed
and
succumbing
mind
of
the
mussulman
that
could
oppose
a
zeal
so
warm
and
fierce
as
for
me
i
of
course
stood
aloof
from
dthemetri
s
crusades
and
did
not
even
render
him
any
active
assistance
when
he
was
striving
as
he
almost
always
was
poor
fellow
on
my
behalf
i
was
only
the
death
s
head
and
white
sheet
with
which
he
scared
the
enemy
i
think
however
that
i
played
this
spectral
part
exceedingly
well
for
i
seldom
appeared
at
all
in
any
discussion
and
whenever
i
did
i
was
sure
to
be
white
and
calm
the
event
which
induced
the
christians
of
nablus
to
seek
for
my
assistance
was
this
a
beautiful
young
christian
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
old
had
lately
been
married
to
a
man
of
her
own
creed
about
the
same
time
probably
on
the
occasion
of
her
wedding
she
was
accidently
seen
by
a
mussulman
sheik
of
great
wealth
and
local
influence
who
instantly
became
madly
enamoured
of
her
the
strict
morality
which
so
generally
prevails
where
the
mussulmans
have
complete
ascendency
prevented
the
sheik
from
entertaining
any
such
sinful
hopes
as
a
european
might
have
ventured
to
cherish
under
the
like
circumstances
and
he
saw
no
chance
of
gratifying
his
love
except
by
inducing
the
girl
to
embrace
his
own
creed
if
he
could
induce
her
to
take
this
step
her
marriage
with
the
christian
would
be
dissolved
and
then
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
making
her
the
last
and
brightest
of
his
wives
the
sheik
was
a
practical
man
and
quickly
began
his
attack
upon
the
theological
opinions
of
the
bride
he
did
not
assail
her
with
the
eloquence
of
any
imaums
or
mussulman
saints
he
did
not
press
upon
her
the
eternal
truths
of
the
cow
or
the
beautiful
morality
of
the
table
he
sent
her
no
tracts
not
even
a
copy
of
the
holy
koran
an
old
woman
acted
as
missionary
she
brought
with
her
a
whole
basketful
of
and
shawls
and
scarfs
and
all
kinds
of
persuasive
finery
poor
mariam
she
put
on
the
jewels
and
took
a
calm
view
of
the
mahometan
religion
in
a
little
she
could
not
be
deaf
to
such
eloquent
earrings
and
the
great
truths
of
islam
came
home
to
her
young
bosom
in
the
delicate
folds
of
the
cashmere
she
was
ready
to
abandon
her
faith
the
sheik
knew
very
well
that
his
attempt
to
convert
an
infidel
was
illegal
and
that
his
proceedings
would
not
bear
investigation
so
he
took
care
to
pay
a
large
sum
to
the
governor
of
nablus
in
order
to
obtain
his
connivance
at
length
mariam
quitted
her
home
and
placed
herself
under
the
protection
of
the
mahometan
authorities
who
however
refrained
from
delivering
her
into
the
arms
of
her
lover
and
detained
her
in
a
mosque
until
the
fact
of
her
real
conversion
which
had
been
indignantly
denied
by
her
relatives
should
be
established
for
two
or
three
days
the
mother
of
the
young
convert
was
prevented
from
communicating
with
her
child
by
various
evasive
contrivances
but
not
it
would
seem
by
a
flat
refusal
at
length
it
was
announced
that
the
young
lady
s
profession
of
faith
might
be
heard
from
her
own
lips
at
an
hour
appointed
the
friends
of
the
sheik
and
the
relatives
of
the
damsel
met
in
the
mosque
the
young
convert
addressed
her
mother
in
a
loud
voice
and
said
god
is
god
and
mahomet
is
the
prophet
of
god
and
thou
oh
my
mother
art
an
infidel
feminine
dog
you
would
suppose
that
this
declaration
so
clearly
enounced
and
that
too
in
a
place
where
mahometanism
is
perhaps
more
supreme
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
empire
would
have
sufficed
to
have
confirmed
the
pretensions
of
the
lover
this
however
was
not
the
case
the
greek
priest
of
the
place
was
despatched
on
a
mission
to
the
governor
of
jerusalem
aboo
goosh
in
order
to
complain
against
the
proceedings
of
the
sheik
and
obtain
a
restitution
of
the
bride
meanwhile
the
mahometan
authorities
at
nablus
were
so
conscious
of
having
acted
unlawfully
in
conspiring
to
disturb
the
faith
of
the
beautiful
infidel
that
they
hesitated
to
take
any
further
steps
and
the
girl
was
still
detained
in
the
mosque
thus
matters
stood
when
the
christians
of
the
place
came
and
sought
to
obtain
my
assistance
i
felt
with
regret
that
i
had
no
personal
interest
in
the
matter
and
i
also
thought
that
there
was
no
pretence
for
my
interfering
with
the
conflicting
claims
of
the
christian
husband
and
the
mahometan
lover
and
i
therefore
declined
to
take
any
step
my
speaking
of
the
husband
by
the
bye
reminds
me
that
he
was
extremely
backward
about
the
great
work
of
recovering
his
youthful
bride
the
relations
of
the
girl
who
felt
themselves
disgraced
by
her
conduct
were
vehement
and
excited
to
a
high
pitch
but
the
menelaus
of
nablus
was
exceedingly
calm
and
composed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
technically
my
duty
to
interfere
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
was
a
very
sufficient
and
yet
a
very
unsatisfactory
reason
for
my
refusal
of
all
assistance
until
you
are
placed
in
situations
of
this
kind
you
can
hardly
tell
how
painful
it
is
to
refrain
from
intermeddling
in
other
people
s
refrain
from
intermeddling
when
you
feel
that
you
can
do
so
with
happy
effect
and
can
remove
a
load
of
distress
by
the
use
of
a
few
small
phrases
upon
this
occasion
however
an
expression
fell
from
one
of
the
girl
s
kinsmen
which
not
only
determined
me
against
the
idea
of
interfering
but
made
me
hope
that
all
attempts
to
recover
the
proselyte
would
fail
this
person
speaking
with
the
most
savage
bitterness
and
with
the
cordial
approval
of
all
the
other
relatives
said
that
the
girl
ought
to
be
beaten
to
death
i
could
not
fail
to
see
that
if
the
poor
child
were
ever
restored
to
her
family
she
would
be
treated
with
the
most
frightful
barbarity
i
heartily
wished
therefore
that
the
mussulmans
might
be
firm
and
preserve
their
young
prize
from
any
fate
so
dreadful
as
that
of
a
return
to
her
own
relations
the
next
day
the
greek
priest
returned
from
his
mission
to
aboo
goosh
but
the
father
of
lies
it
would
seem
had
been
well
plied
with
the
gold
of
the
enamoured
sheik
and
contrived
to
put
off
the
prayers
of
the
christians
by
cunning
feints
now
therefore
a
second
and
more
numerous
deputation
than
the
first
waited
upon
me
and
implored
my
intervention
with
the
governor
i
informed
the
assembled
christians
that
since
their
last
application
i
had
carefully
considered
the
matter
the
religious
question
i
thought
might
be
put
aside
at
once
for
the
excessive
levity
which
the
girl
had
displayed
proved
clearly
that
in
adopting
mahometanism
she
was
not
quitting
any
other
faith
her
mind
must
have
been
thoroughly
blank
upon
religious
questions
and
she
was
not
therefore
to
be
treated
as
a
christian
that
had
strayed
from
the
flock
but
rather
as
a
child
without
any
religion
at
all
who
was
willing
to
conform
to
the
usages
of
those
who
would
deck
her
with
jewels
and
clothe
her
with
cashmere
shawls
so
much
for
the
religious
part
of
the
question
well
then
in
a
mere
temporal
sense
it
appeared
to
me
that
looking
merely
to
the
interests
of
the
damsel
for
i
rather
unjustly
put
poor
menelaus
quite
out
of
the
question
the
advantages
were
all
on
the
side
of
the
mahometan
match
the
sheik
was
in
a
much
higher
station
of
life
than
the
superseded
husband
and
had
given
the
best
possible
proof
of
his
ardent
affection
by
the
sacrifices
he
had
made
and
the
risks
he
had
incurred
for
the
sake
of
the
beloved
object
i
therefore
stated
fairly
to
the
horror
and
amazement
of
all
my
hearers
that
the
sheik
in
my
view
was
likely
to
make
a
most
capital
husband
and
that
i
entirely
approved
of
the
i
left
nablus
under
the
impression
that
mariam
would
soon
be
delivered
to
her
mussulman
lover
i
afterwards
found
however
that
the
result
was
very
different
dthemetri
s
religious
zeal
and
hate
had
been
so
much
excited
by
the
account
of
these
events
and
by
the
grief
and
mortification
of
his
that
when
he
found
me
firmly
determined
to
decline
all
interference
in
the
matter
he
secretly
appealed
to
the
governor
in
my
name
and
using
i
suppose
many
violent
threats
and
telling
no
doubt
many
lies
about
my
station
and
influence
extorted
a
promise
that
the
proselyte
should
be
restored
to
her
relatives
i
did
not
understand
that
the
girl
had
been
actually
given
up
whilst
i
remained
at
nablus
but
dthemetri
certainly
did
not
desist
from
his
instances
until
he
had
satisfied
himself
by
some
means
or
other
for
mere
words
amounted
to
nothing
that
the
promise
would
be
actually
performed
it
was
not
till
i
had
quitted
syria
and
when
dthemetri
was
no
longer
in
my
service
that
this
villainous
though
trick
of
his
came
to
my
knowledge
mysseri
who
had
informed
me
of
the
step
which
had
been
taken
did
not
know
it
himself
until
some
time
after
we
had
quitted
nablus
when
dthemetri
exultingly
confessed
his
successful
enterprise
i
know
not
whether
the
engagement
which
my
zealous
dragoman
extorted
from
the
governor
was
ever
complied
with
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
fate
which
must
have
befallen
mariam
if
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
christians
chapter
xxvi
the
prophet
damoor
for
some
hours
i
passed
along
the
shores
of
the
fair
lake
of
galilee
then
turning
a
little
to
the
westward
i
struck
into
a
mountainous
tract
and
as
i
advanced
thenceforward
the
lie
of
the
country
kept
growing
more
and
more
bold
at
length
i
drew
near
to
the
city
of
safed
it
sits
as
proud
as
a
fortress
upon
the
summit
of
a
craggy
height
yet
because
of
its
minarets
and
stately
trees
the
place
looks
happy
and
beautiful
it
is
one
of
the
holy
cities
of
the
talmud
and
according
to
this
authority
the
messiah
will
reign
there
for
forty
years
before
he
takes
possession
of
sion
the
sanctity
and
historical
importance
thus
attributed
to
the
city
by
anticipation
render
it
a
favourite
place
of
retirement
for
israelites
of
whom
it
contains
they
say
about
four
thousand
a
number
nearly
balancing
that
of
the
mahometan
inhabitants
i
knew
by
my
experience
of
tabarieh
that
a
holy
city
was
sure
to
have
a
population
of
vermin
somewhat
proportionate
to
the
number
of
its
israelites
and
i
therefore
caused
my
tent
to
be
pitched
upon
a
green
spot
of
ground
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
walls
of
the
town
when
it
had
become
quite
dark
for
there
was
no
moon
that
night
i
was
informed
that
several
jews
had
secretly
come
from
the
city
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
assistance
from
me
in
circumstances
of
imminent
danger
i
was
also
informed
that
they
claimed
my
aid
upon
the
ground
that
some
of
their
number
were
british
subjects
it
was
arranged
that
the
two
principal
men
of
the
party
should
speak
for
the
rest
and
these
were
accordingly
admitted
into
my
tent
one
of
the
two
called
himself
the
british
and
he
had
with
him
his
consular
cap
but
he
frankly
said
that
he
could
not
have
dared
to
assume
this
emblem
of
his
dignity
in
the
daytime
and
that
nothing
but
the
extreme
darkness
of
the
night
rendered
it
safe
for
him
to
put
it
on
upon
this
occasion
the
other
of
the
spokesmen
was
a
jew
of
gibraltar
a
tolerably
person
who
spoke
english
very
fluently
these
men
informed
me
that
the
jews
of
the
place
who
were
exceedingly
wealthy
had
lived
peaceably
in
their
retirement
until
the
insurrection
which
took
place
in
but
about
the
beginning
of
that
year
a
highly
religious
mussulman
called
mohammed
damoor
went
forth
into
the
crying
with
a
loud
voice
and
prophesying
that
on
the
fifteenth
of
the
following
june
the
true
believers
would
rise
up
in
just
wrath
against
the
jews
and
despoil
them
of
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
their
jewels
the
earnestness
of
the
prophet
produced
some
impression
at
the
time
but
all
went
on
as
usual
until
at
last
the
fifteenth
of
june
arrived
when
that
day
dawned
the
whole
mussulman
population
of
the
place
assembled
in
the
streets
that
they
might
see
the
result
of
the
prophecy
suddenly
mohammed
damoor
rushed
furious
into
the
crowd
and
the
fierce
shout
of
the
prophet
soon
ensured
the
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
some
of
the
jews
fled
and
some
remained
but
they
who
fled
and
they
who
remained
alike
and
unresistingly
left
their
property
to
the
hands
of
the
spoilers
the
most
odious
of
all
outrages
that
of
searching
the
women
for
the
base
purpose
of
discovering
such
things
as
gold
and
silver
concealed
about
their
persons
was
perpetrated
without
shame
the
poor
jews
were
so
stricken
with
terror
that
they
submitted
to
their
fate
even
where
resistance
would
have
been
easy
in
several
instances
a
young
mussulman
boy
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
walked
straight
into
the
house
of
a
jew
and
stripped
him
of
his
property
before
his
face
and
in
the
presence
of
his
whole
family
when
the
insurrection
was
put
down
some
of
the
mussulmans
most
probably
those
who
had
got
no
spoil
wherewith
they
might
buy
immunity
were
punished
but
the
greater
part
of
them
escaped
none
of
the
booty
was
restored
and
the
pecuniary
redress
which
the
pasha
had
undertaken
to
enforce
for
them
had
been
hitherto
so
carefully
delayed
that
the
hope
of
ever
obtaining
it
had
grown
very
faint
a
new
governor
had
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
place
with
stringent
orders
to
ascertain
the
real
extent
of
the
losses
and
to
discover
the
spoilers
with
a
view
of
compelling
them
to
make
restitution
it
was
found
that
notwithstanding
the
urgency
of
the
instructions
which
the
governor
had
received
he
did
not
push
on
the
affair
with
the
vigour
that
had
been
expected
the
jews
complained
and
either
by
the
protection
of
the
british
consul
at
damascus
or
by
some
other
means
had
influence
enough
to
induce
the
appointment
of
a
special
called
him
the
modeer
duty
it
was
to
watch
for
and
prevent
anything
like
connivance
on
the
part
of
the
governor
and
to
push
on
the
investigation
with
vigour
and
impartiality
such
were
the
instructions
with
which
some
few
weeks
since
the
modeer
came
charged
the
result
was
that
the
investigation
had
made
no
practical
advance
and
that
the
modeer
as
well
as
the
governor
was
living
upon
terms
of
affectionate
friendship
with
mohammed
damoor
and
the
rest
of
the
principal
spoilers
thus
stood
the
chance
of
redress
for
the
past
but
the
cause
of
the
agonising
excitement
under
which
the
jews
of
the
place
now
laboured
was
recent
and
justly
alarming
mohammed
damoor
had
again
gone
forth
into
the
and
lifted
up
his
voice
and
prophesied
a
second
spoliation
of
the
israelites
this
was
grave
matter
the
words
of
such
a
practical
man
as
mohammed
damoor
were
not
to
be
despised
i
fear
i
must
have
smiled
visibly
for
i
was
greatly
amused
and
even
i
think
gratified
at
the
account
of
this
second
prophecy
nevertheless
my
heart
warmed
towards
the
poor
oppressed
israelites
and
i
was
flattered
too
in
the
point
of
my
national
vanity
at
the
notion
of
the
link
by
which
a
jew
in
syria
who
had
been
born
on
the
rock
of
gibraltar
was
able
to
claim
me
as
his
if
i
hesitated
at
all
between
the
impropriety
of
interfering
in
a
matter
which
was
no
business
of
mine
and
the
infernal
shame
of
refusing
my
aid
at
such
a
conjecture
i
soon
came
to
a
very
ungentlemanly
decision
namely
that
i
would
be
guilty
of
the
impropriety
and
not
of
the
infernal
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
immediate
arrest
of
mohammed
damoor
was
the
one
thing
needful
to
the
safety
of
the
jews
and
i
felt
confident
for
reasons
which
i
have
already
mentioned
in
speaking
of
the
nablus
affair
that
i
should
be
able
to
obtain
this
result
by
making
a
formal
application
to
the
governor
i
told
my
applicants
that
i
would
take
this
step
on
the
following
morning
they
were
very
grateful
and
were
for
a
moment
much
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
safety
which
might
thus
be
opened
to
them
but
the
deliberation
of
a
minute
entirely
altered
their
views
and
filled
them
with
new
terror
they
declared
that
any
attempt
or
pretended
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
governor
to
arrest
mohammed
damoor
would
certainly
produce
an
immediate
movement
of
the
whole
mussulman
population
and
a
consequent
massacre
and
robbery
of
the
israelites
my
visitors
went
out
and
remained
i
know
not
how
long
consulting
with
their
brethren
but
all
at
last
agreed
that
their
present
perilous
and
painful
position
was
better
than
a
certain
and
immediate
attack
and
that
if
mohammed
damoor
was
seized
their
second
estate
would
be
worse
than
their
first
i
myself
did
not
think
that
this
would
be
the
case
but
i
could
not
of
course
force
my
aid
upon
the
people
against
their
will
and
moreover
the
day
fixed
for
the
fulfilment
of
this
second
prophecy
was
not
very
close
at
hand
a
little
delay
therefore
in
providing
against
the
impending
danger
would
not
necessarily
be
fatal
the
men
now
confessed
that
although
they
had
come
with
so
much
mystery
and
as
they
thought
at
so
great
a
risk
to
ask
my
assistance
they
were
unable
to
suggest
any
mode
in
which
i
could
aid
them
except
indeed
by
mentioning
their
grievances
to
the
at
damascus
this
i
promised
to
do
and
this
i
did
my
visitors
were
very
thankful
to
me
for
the
readiness
which
i
had
shown
to
intermeddle
in
their
affairs
and
the
grateful
wives
of
the
principal
jews
sent
to
me
many
compliments
with
choice
wines
and
elaborate
sweetmeats
the
course
of
my
travels
soon
drew
me
so
far
from
safed
that
i
never
heard
how
the
dreadful
day
passed
off
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
second
prophecy
if
the
predicted
spoliation
was
prevented
poor
mohammed
damoor
must
have
been
forced
i
suppose
to
say
that
he
had
prophesied
in
a
metaphorical
sense
this
would
be
a
sad
falling
off
from
the
brilliant
and
substantial
success
of
the
first
experiment
chapter
xxvii
damascus
for
a
part
of
two
days
i
wound
under
the
base
of
the
djibel
el
sheik
and
then
entered
upon
a
vast
and
desolate
plain
rarely
pierced
at
intervals
by
some
sort
of
withered
stem
the
earth
in
its
length
and
its
breadth
and
all
the
deep
universe
of
sky
was
steeped
in
light
and
heat
on
i
rode
through
the
fire
but
long
before
evening
came
there
were
straining
eyes
that
saw
and
joyful
voices
that
announced
the
sight
of
shaum
holy
the
blessed
damascus
but
that
which
at
last
i
reached
with
my
longing
eyes
was
not
a
speck
in
the
horizon
gradually
expanding
to
a
group
of
roofs
and
walls
but
a
long
low
line
of
blackest
green
that
ran
right
across
in
the
distance
from
east
to
west
and
this
as
i
approached
grew
deeper
grew
wavy
in
its
outline
soon
forest
trees
shot
up
before
my
eyes
and
robed
their
broad
shoulders
so
freshly
that
all
the
throngs
of
olives
as
they
rose
into
view
looked
sad
in
their
proper
dimness
there
were
even
now
no
houses
to
see
but
only
the
minarets
peered
out
from
the
midst
of
shade
into
the
glowing
sky
and
bravely
touched
the
sun
there
seemed
to
be
here
no
mere
city
but
rather
a
province
wide
and
rich
that
bounded
the
torrid
waste
until
about
a
year
or
two
years
before
the
time
of
my
going
there
damascus
had
kept
up
so
much
of
the
old
bigot
zeal
against
christians
or
rather
against
europeans
that
no
one
dressed
as
a
frank
could
have
dared
to
show
himself
in
the
streets
but
the
firmness
and
temper
of
farren
who
hoisted
his
flag
in
the
city
as
for
the
district
had
soon
put
an
end
to
all
intolerance
of
englishmen
damascus
was
safer
than
oxford
when
i
entered
the
city
in
my
usual
dress
there
was
but
one
poor
fellow
that
wagged
his
tongue
and
him
in
the
open
streets
dthemetri
horsewhipped
during
my
stay
i
went
wherever
i
chose
and
attended
the
public
baths
without
molestation
indeed
my
relations
with
the
pleasanter
portion
of
the
mahometan
population
were
upon
a
much
better
footing
here
than
at
most
other
places
in
the
principal
streets
of
damascus
there
is
a
path
for
which
is
raised
i
think
a
foot
or
two
above
the
until
the
arrival
of
the
british
none
but
a
mussulman
had
been
permitted
to
walk
upon
the
upper
way
farren
would
not
of
course
suffer
that
the
humiliation
of
any
such
exclusion
should
be
submitted
to
by
an
englishman
and
i
always
walked
upon
the
raised
path
as
free
and
unmolested
as
if
i
had
been
in
pall
mall
the
old
usage
was
however
maintained
with
as
much
strictness
as
ever
against
the
christian
rayahs
and
jews
not
one
of
them
could
have
set
his
foot
upon
the
privileged
path
without
endangering
his
life
i
was
lounging
one
day
i
remember
along
the
paths
of
the
faithful
when
a
christian
rayah
from
the
below
saluted
me
with
such
earnestness
and
craved
so
anxiously
to
speak
and
be
spoken
to
that
he
soon
brought
me
to
a
halt
he
had
nothing
to
tell
except
only
the
glory
and
exultation
with
which
he
saw
a
stand
level
with
the
imperious
mussulmans
perhaps
he
had
been
absent
from
the
place
for
some
time
for
otherwise
i
hardly
know
how
it
could
have
happened
that
my
exaltation
was
the
first
instance
he
had
seen
his
joy
was
great
so
strong
and
strenuous
was
england
lord
palmerston
reigned
in
those
days
that
it
was
a
pride
and
delight
for
a
syrian
christian
to
look
up
and
say
that
the
englishman
s
faith
was
his
too
if
i
was
vexed
at
all
that
i
could
not
give
the
man
a
lift
and
shake
hands
with
him
on
level
ground
there
was
no
alloy
to
pleasure
he
followed
me
on
not
looking
to
his
own
path
but
keeping
his
eyes
on
me
he
saw
as
he
thought
and
said
for
he
came
with
me
on
to
my
quarters
the
period
of
the
mahometan
s
absolute
ascendency
the
beginning
of
the
christian
s
he
had
so
closely
associated
the
insulting
privilege
of
the
path
with
actual
dominion
that
seeing
it
now
in
one
instance
abandoned
he
looked
for
the
quick
coming
of
european
troops
his
lips
only
whispered
and
that
tremulously
but
his
fiery
eyes
spoke
out
their
triumph
in
long
and
loud
hurrahs
i
too
am
a
christian
my
foes
are
the
foes
of
the
english
we
are
all
one
people
and
christ
is
our
if
i
poorly
deserved
yet
i
liked
this
claim
of
brotherhood
not
all
the
warnings
which
i
heard
against
their
rascality
could
hinder
me
from
feeling
kindly
towards
my
in
the
east
english
travellers
from
a
habit
perhaps
of
depreciating
sectarians
in
their
own
country
are
apt
to
look
down
upon
the
oriental
christians
as
being
dissenters
from
the
established
religion
of
a
mahometan
empire
i
never
did
thus
by
a
natural
perversity
of
disposition
which
my
nursemaids
called
i
felt
the
more
strongly
for
my
creed
when
i
saw
it
despised
among
men
i
quite
tolerated
the
christianity
of
mahometan
countries
notwithstanding
its
humble
aspect
and
the
damaged
character
of
its
followers
i
went
further
and
extended
some
sympathy
towards
those
who
with
all
the
claims
of
superior
intellect
learning
and
industry
were
kept
down
under
the
heel
of
the
mussulmans
by
reason
of
their
having
faith
i
heard
as
i
fancied
the
faint
echo
of
an
old
crusader
s
conscience
that
whispered
and
said
common
cause
the
impulse
was
as
you
may
suppose
much
too
feeble
to
bring
me
into
trouble
it
merely
influenced
my
actions
in
a
way
thoroughly
characteristic
of
this
poor
sluggish
century
that
is
by
making
me
speak
almost
as
civilly
to
the
followers
of
christ
as
i
did
to
their
mahometan
foes
this
holy
damascus
this
earthly
paradise
of
the
prophet
so
fair
to
the
eyes
that
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
tarry
in
her
blissful
shades
she
is
a
city
of
hidden
palaces
of
copses
and
gardens
and
fountains
and
bubbling
streams
the
juice
of
her
life
is
the
gushing
and
torrent
that
tumbles
from
the
snowy
sides
of
close
along
on
the
river
s
edge
through
seven
sweet
miles
of
rustling
boughs
and
deepest
shade
the
city
spreads
out
her
whole
length
as
a
man
falls
flat
face
forward
on
the
brook
that
he
may
drink
and
drink
again
so
damascus
thirsting
for
ever
lies
down
with
her
lips
to
the
stream
and
clings
to
its
rushing
waters
the
chief
places
of
public
amusement
or
rather
of
public
relaxation
are
the
baths
and
the
great
café
this
last
which
is
frequented
at
night
by
most
of
the
wealthy
men
and
by
many
of
the
humbler
sort
consists
of
a
number
of
sheds
very
simply
framed
and
built
in
a
labyrinth
of
running
streams
which
foam
and
roar
on
every
side
the
place
is
lit
up
in
the
simplest
manner
by
numbers
of
small
pale
lamps
strung
upon
loose
cords
and
so
suspended
from
branch
to
branch
that
the
light
though
it
looks
so
quiet
amongst
the
darkening
foliage
yet
leaps
and
brightly
flashes
as
it
falls
upon
the
troubled
waters
all
around
and
chiefly
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
torrents
groups
of
people
are
tranquilly
seated
they
all
drink
coffee
and
inhale
the
cold
fumes
of
the
they
talk
rather
gently
the
one
to
the
other
or
else
are
silent
a
father
will
sometimes
have
two
or
three
of
his
boys
around
him
but
the
joyousness
of
an
oriental
child
is
all
of
the
sober
sort
and
never
disturbs
the
reigning
calm
of
the
land
it
has
been
generally
understood
i
believe
that
the
houses
of
damascus
are
more
sumptuous
than
those
of
any
other
city
in
the
east
some
of
these
said
to
be
the
most
magnificent
in
the
place
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
every
rich
man
s
house
stands
detached
from
its
neighbours
at
the
side
of
a
garden
and
it
is
from
this
cause
no
doubt
that
the
city
severely
menaced
by
prophecy
has
hitherto
escaped
destruction
you
know
some
parts
of
spain
but
you
have
never
i
think
been
in
andalusia
if
you
had
i
could
easily
show
you
the
interior
of
a
damascene
house
by
referring
you
to
the
alhambra
or
alcanzar
of
seville
the
lofty
rooms
are
adorned
with
a
rich
inlaying
of
many
colours
and
illuminated
writing
on
the
walls
the
floors
are
of
marble
one
side
of
any
room
intended
for
noonday
retirement
is
generally
laid
open
to
a
quadrangle
in
the
centre
of
which
there
dances
the
jet
of
a
fountain
there
is
no
furniture
that
can
interfere
with
the
cool
emptiness
of
the
apartments
a
divan
which
is
a
low
and
doubly
broad
sofa
runs
round
the
three
walled
sides
of
the
room
a
few
persian
carpets
which
ought
to
be
called
persian
rugs
for
that
is
the
word
which
indicates
their
shape
and
dimensions
are
sometimes
thrown
about
near
the
divan
they
are
placed
without
order
the
one
partly
lapping
over
the
other
and
thus
disposed
they
give
to
the
room
an
appearance
of
uncaring
luxury
except
these
of
which
i
saw
few
for
the
time
was
summer
and
fiercely
hot
there
is
nothing
to
obstruct
the
welcome
air
and
the
whole
of
the
marble
floor
from
one
divan
to
the
other
and
from
the
head
of
the
chamber
across
to
the
murmuring
fountain
is
thoroughly
open
and
free
so
simple
as
this
is
asiatic
luxury
the
oriental
is
not
a
contriving
animal
there
is
nothing
intricate
in
his
magnificence
the
impossibility
of
handing
down
property
from
father
to
son
for
any
long
period
consecutively
seems
to
prevent
the
existence
of
those
traditions
by
which
with
us
the
refined
modes
of
applying
wealth
are
made
known
to
its
inheritors
we
know
that
in
england
a
rich
man
can
not
by
taking
thought
and
spending
money
obtain
even
the
furniture
as
a
gentleman
the
complicated
character
of
an
english
establishment
allows
room
for
subtle
distinctions
between
that
which
is
il
and
that
which
is
not
all
such
refinements
are
unknown
in
the
east
the
pasha
and
the
peasant
have
the
same
tastes
the
broad
cold
marble
floor
the
simple
couch
the
air
freshly
waving
through
a
shady
chamber
a
verse
of
the
koran
emblazoned
on
the
wall
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
falling
water
the
cold
fragrant
smoke
of
the
and
a
small
collection
of
wives
and
children
in
the
inner
these
the
utmost
enjoyments
of
the
grandee
are
yet
such
as
to
be
appreciable
by
the
humblest
mussulman
in
the
empire
but
its
gardens
are
the
delight
the
delight
and
the
pride
of
damascus
they
are
not
the
formal
parterres
which
you
might
expect
from
the
oriental
taste
they
rather
bring
back
to
your
mind
the
memory
of
some
dark
old
shrubbery
in
our
northern
isle
that
has
been
charmingly
kept
up
for
many
and
many
a
day
when
you
see
a
rich
wilderness
of
wood
in
decent
england
it
is
like
enough
that
you
see
it
with
some
soft
regrets
the
puzzled
old
woman
at
the
lodge
can
give
small
account
of
the
she
thinks
it
is
italy
that
has
made
the
whole
circle
of
her
world
so
gloomy
and
sad
you
avoid
the
house
in
lively
dread
of
a
lone
housekeeper
but
you
make
your
way
on
by
the
stables
you
remember
that
gable
with
all
its
neatly
nailed
trophies
of
fitchets
and
hawks
and
owls
now
slowly
falling
to
pieces
you
remember
that
stable
and
the
doors
are
all
fastened
that
used
to
be
standing
ajar
the
paint
of
things
painted
is
blistered
and
cracked
grass
grows
in
the
yard
just
there
in
october
mornings
the
keeper
would
wait
with
the
dogs
and
the
keeper
now
you
hurry
away
and
gain
the
small
wicket
that
used
to
open
to
the
touch
of
a
lightsome
is
fastened
with
a
padlock
the
only
new
looking
thing
and
is
stained
with
thick
green
damp
you
climb
it
and
bury
yourself
in
the
deep
shade
and
strive
but
lazily
with
the
tangling
briars
and
stop
for
long
minutes
to
judge
and
determine
whether
you
will
creep
beneath
the
long
boughs
and
make
them
your
archway
or
whether
perhaps
you
will
lift
your
heel
and
tread
them
down
under
foot
long
doubt
and
scarcely
to
be
ended
till
you
wake
from
the
memory
of
those
days
when
the
path
was
clear
and
chase
that
phantom
of
a
muslin
sleeve
that
once
weighed
warm
upon
your
arm
wild
as
that
the
nighest
woodland
of
a
deserted
home
in
england
but
without
its
sweet
sadness
is
the
sumptuous
garden
of
damascus
forest
trees
tall
and
stately
enough
if
you
could
see
their
lofty
crests
yet
lead
a
tussling
life
of
it
below
with
their
branches
struggling
against
strong
numbers
of
bushes
and
wilful
shrubs
the
shade
upon
the
earth
is
black
as
night
high
high
above
your
head
and
on
every
side
all
down
to
the
ground
the
thicket
is
hemmed
in
and
choked
up
by
the
interlacing
boughs
that
droop
with
the
weight
of
roses
and
load
the
slow
air
with
their
damask
breath
there
are
no
other
flowers
here
and
there
there
are
patches
of
ground
made
clear
from
the
cover
and
these
are
either
carelessly
planted
with
some
common
and
useful
vegetable
or
else
are
left
free
to
the
wayward
ways
of
nature
and
bear
rank
weeds
and
cool
to
the
eyes
and
freshening
the
sense
with
their
earthy
and
bitter
fragrance
there
is
a
lane
opened
through
the
thicket
so
broad
in
some
places
that
you
can
pass
along
side
by
side
in
some
so
narrow
the
shrubs
are
for
ever
encroaching
that
you
ought
if
you
can
to
go
on
the
first
and
hold
back
the
bough
of
the
and
through
this
wilderness
there
tumbles
a
loud
rushing
stream
which
is
halted
at
last
in
the
lowest
corner
of
the
garden
and
there
tossed
up
in
a
fountain
by
the
side
of
the
simple
alcove
this
is
all
never
for
an
instant
will
the
people
of
damascus
attempt
to
separate
the
idea
of
bliss
from
these
wild
gardens
and
rushing
waters
even
where
your
best
affections
are
concerned
and
you
prudent
preachers
hold
hard
and
turn
aside
when
they
come
near
the
mysteries
of
the
happy
state
and
we
prudent
preachers
too
we
will
hush
our
voices
and
never
reveal
to
finite
beings
the
joys
of
the
earthly

i
got
rather
well
out
of
that
the
path
by
which
i
crossed
the
lebanon
is
like
i
think
in
its
features
to
one
which
you
must
know
namely
that
of
the
foorca
in
the
bernese
oberland
for
a
great
part
of
the
way
i
toiled
rather
painfully
through
the
dazzling
snow
but
the
labour
of
ascending
added
to
the
excitement
with
which
i
looked
for
the
summit
of
the
pass
the
time
came
there
was
a
minute
in
the
which
i
saw
nothing
but
the
steep
white
shoulder
of
the
mountain
and
there
was
another
minute
and
that
the
next
which
showed
me
a
nether
heaven
of
fleecy
clouds
that
floated
along
far
down
in
the
air
beneath
me
and
showed
me
beyond
the
breadth
of
all
syria
west
of
the
lebanon
but
chiefly
i
clung
with
my
eyes
to
the
dim
steadfast
line
of
the
sea
which
closed
my
utmost
view
i
had
grown
well
used
of
late
to
the
people
and
the
scenes
of
forlorn
used
to
tombs
and
ruins
to
silent
cities
and
deserted
plains
to
tranquil
men
and
women
sadly
veiled
and
now
that
i
saw
the
even
plain
of
the
sea
i
leapt
with
an
easy
leap
to
its
yonder
shores
and
saw
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
west
in
that
fair
path
that
could
lead
me
from
out
of
this
silent
land
straight
on
into
shrill
marseilles
or
round
by
the
pillars
of
hercules
to
the
crash
and
roar
of
london
my
place
upon
this
dividing
barrier
was
as
a
man
s
puzzling
station
in
eternity
between
the
birthless
past
and
the
future
that
has
no
end
behind
me
i
left
an
old

i
lingered
too
long
upon
the
difficult
pass
that
leads
from
thought
to
action
i
descended
and
went
towards
the
west
the
group
of
cedars
remaining
on
this
part
of
the
lebanon
is
held
sacred
by
the
greek
church
on
account
of
a
prevailing
notion
that
the
trees
were
standing
at
a
time
when
the
temple
of
jerusalem
was
built
they
occupy
three
or
four
acres
on
the
mountain
s
side
and
many
of
them
are
gnarled
in
a
way
that
implies
great
age
but
except
these
signs
i
saw
nothing
in
their
appearance
or
conduct
that
tended
to
prove
them
contemporaries
of
the
cedars
employed
in
solomon
s
temple
the
final
cause
to
which
these
aged
survivors
owed
their
preservation
was
explained
to
me
in
the
evening
by
a
glorious
old
fellow
a
christian
chief
who
made
me
welcome
in
the
valley
of
eden
in
ancient
times
the
whole
range
of
the
lebanon
had
been
covered
with
cedars
and
as
the
fertile
plains
beneath
became
more
and
more
infested
by
government
officers
and
tyrants
of
high
and
low
degree
the
people
by
degrees
abandoned
them
and
flocked
to
the
rugged
mountains
which
were
less
accessible
to
their
indolent
oppressors
the
cedar
forests
gradually
shrank
under
the
axe
of
the
encroaching
multitudes
and
seemed
at
last
to
be
on
the
point
of
disappearing
entirely
when
an
aged
chief
who
ruled
in
this
district
and
who
had
witnessed
the
great
change
effected
even
in
his
own
lifetime
chose
to
say
that
some
sign
or
memorial
should
be
left
of
the
vast
woods
with
which
the
mountains
had
formerly
been
clad
and
commanded
accordingly
that
this
group
of
trees
which
was
probably
situated
at
the
highest
point
to
which
the
forest
had
reached
should
remain
untouched
the
chief
it
seems
was
not
moved
by
the
notion
i
have
mentioned
as
prevailing
in
the
greek
church
but
rather
by
some
sentiment
of
veneration
for
a
great
natural
sentiment
akin
perhaps
to
that
old
and
earthborn
religion
which
made
men
bow
down
to
creation
before
they
had
yet
learnt
how
to
know
and
worship
the
creator
the
chief
of
the
valley
in
which
i
passed
the
night
was
a
man
of
large
possessions
and
he
entertained
me
very
sumptuously
he
was
highly
intelligent
and
had
had
the
sagacity
to
foresee
that
europe
would
intervene
authoritatively
in
the
affairs
of
syria
bearing
this
idea
in
mind
and
with
a
view
to
give
his
son
an
advantageous
start
in
the
ambitious
career
for
which
he
was
destined
he
had
hired
for
him
a
teacher
of
the
italian
language
the
only
accessible
european
tongue
the
tutor
however
who
was
a
native
of
syria
either
did
not
know
or
did
not
choose
to
teach
the
european
forms
of
address
but
contented
himself
with
instructing
his
pupil
in
the
mere
language
of
italy
this
circumstance
gave
me
an
opportunity
the
only
one
i
ever
had
or
was
likely
to
have
of
hearing
the
phrases
of
oriental
courtesy
in
a
european
tongue
the
boy
was
about
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
and
having
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
speak
to
me
without
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
he
took
a
prominent
part
in
doing
the
honours
of
his
father
s
house
he
went
through
his
duties
with
untiring
assiduity
and
with
a
kind
of
gracefulness
which
by
mere
description
can
scarcely
be
made
intelligible
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
manners
of
the
asiatics
the
boy
s
address
resembled
a
little
that
of
a
highly
polished
and
insinuating
roman
catholic
priest
but
had
more
of
girlish
gentleness
it
was
strange
to
hear
him
gravely
and
slowly
enunciating
the
common
and
extravagant
compliments
of
the
east
in
good
italian
and
in
soft
persuasive
tones
i
recollect
that
i
was
particularly
amused
at
the
gracious
obstinacy
with
which
he
maintained
that
the
house
in
which
i
was
so
hospitably
entertained
belonged
not
to
his
father
but
to
me
to
say
this
once
was
only
to
use
the
common
form
of
speech
signifying
no
more
than
our
sweet
word
welcome
but
the
amusing
part
of
the
matter
was
that
whenever
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
happened
to
speak
of
his
father
s
house
or
the
surrounding
domain
the
boy
invariably
interfered
to
correct
my
pretended
mistake
and
to
assure
me
once
again
with
a
gentle
decisiveness
of
manner
that
the
whole
property
was
really
and
exclusively
mine
and
that
his
father
had
not
the
most
distant
pretensions
to
its
ownership
i
received
from
my
host
much
and
as
i
now
know
most
true
information
respecting
the
people
of
the
mountains
and
their
power
of
resisting
mehemet
ali
the
chief
gave
me
very
plainly
to
understand
that
the
mountaineers
being
dependent
upon
others
for
bread
and
gunpowder
the
two
great
necessaries
of
martial
life
could
not
long
hold
out
against
a
power
which
occupied
the
plains
and
commanded
the
sea
but
he
also
assured
me
and
that
very
significantly
that
if
this
source
of
weakness
were
provided
against
mountaineers
were
to
be
depended
he
told
me
that
in
ten
or
fifteen
days
the
chiefs
could
bring
together
some
fifty
thousand
fighting
men
chapter
xxix
surprise
of
satalieh
whilst
i
was
remaining
upon
the
coast
of
syria
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
become
acquainted
with
the
russian
sataliefsky
a
general
officer
who
in
his
youth
had
fought
and
bled
at
borodino
but
was
now
better
known
among
diplomats
by
the
important
trust
committed
to
him
at
a
period
highly
critical
for
the
affairs
of
eastern
europe
i
must
not
tell
you
his
family
name
my
mention
of
his
title
can
do
him
no
harm
for
it
is
i
and
i
only
who
have
conferred
it
in
consideration
of
the
military
and
diplomatic
services
performed
under
my
own
eyes
the
general
as
well
as
i
was
bound
for
smyrna
and
we
agreed
to
sail
together
in
an
ionian
brigantine
we
did
not
charter
the
vessel
but
we
made
our
arrangement
with
the
captain
upon
such
terms
that
we
could
be
put
ashore
upon
any
part
of
the
coast
that
we
might
choose
we
sailed
and
day
after
day
the
vessel
lay
dawdling
on
the
sea
with
calms
and
feeble
breezes
for
her
portion
i
myself
was
well
repaid
for
the
painful
restlessness
which
such
weather
occasions
because
i
gained
from
my
companion
a
little
of
that
vast
fund
of
interesting
knowledge
with
which
he
was
stored
knowledge
a
thousand
times
the
more
highly
to
be
prized
since
it
was
not
of
the
sort
that
is
to
be
gathered
from
books
but
only
from
the
lips
of
those
who
have
acted
a
part
in
the
world
when
after
nine
days
of
sailing
or
trying
to
sail
we
found
ourselves
still
hanging
by
the
mainland
to
the
north
of
the
isle
of
cyprus
we
determined
to
disembark
at
satalieh
and
to
go
on
thence
by
land
a
light
breeze
favoured
our
purpose
and
it
was
with
great
delight
that
we
neared
the
fragrant
land
and
saw
our
anchor
go
down
in
the
bay
of
satalieh
within
two
or
three
hundred
yards
of
the
shore
the
town
of
satalieh
is
the
chief
place
of
the
pashalic
in
which
it
is
situate
and
its
citadel
is
the
residence
of
the
pasha
we
had
scarcely
dropped
our
anchor
when
a
boat
from
the
shore
came
alongside
with
officers
on
board
who
announced
that
the
strictest
orders
had
been
received
for
maintaining
a
quarantine
of
three
weeks
against
all
vessels
coming
from
syria
and
directed
accordingly
that
no
one
from
the
vessel
should
disembark
in
reply
we
sent
a
message
to
the
pasha
setting
forth
the
rank
and
titles
of
the
general
and
requiring
permission
to
go
ashore
after
a
while
the
boat
came
again
alongside
and
the
officers
declaring
that
the
orders
received
from
constantinople
were
imperative
and
unexceptional
formally
enjoined
us
in
the
name
of
the
pasha
to
abstain
from
any
attempt
to
land
i
had
been
hitherto
much
less
impatient
of
our
slow
voyage
than
my
gallant
friend
but
this
opposition
made
the
smooth
sea
seem
to
me
like
a
prison
from
which
i
must
and
would
break
out
i
had
an
unbounded
faith
in
the
feebleness
of
asiatic
potentates
and
i
proposed
that
we
should
set
the
pasha
at
defiance
the
general
had
been
worked
up
to
a
state
of
a
most
painful
agitation
by
the
idea
of
being
driven
from
the
shore
which
smiled
so
pleasantly
before
his
eyes
and
he
adopted
my
suggestion
with
rapture
we
determined
to
land
to
approach
the
sweet
shore
after
a
tedious
voyage
and
then
to
be
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
prohibited
from
is
so
maddening
to
the
temper
that
no
one
who
had
ever
experienced
the
trial
would
say
that
even
the
most
violent
impatience
of
such
restraint
is
wholly
inexcusable
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
however
that
the
course
which
we
chose
to
adopt
on
the
occasion
can
be
perfectly
justified
the
impropriety
of
a
traveller
s
setting
at
naught
the
regulations
of
a
foreign
state
is
clear
enough
and
the
bad
taste
of
compassing
such
a
purpose
by
mere
gasconading
is
still
more
glaringly
plain
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
the
pasha
understood
his
duty
and
had
energy
enough
to
perform
it
he
would
order
out
a
file
of
soldiers
the
moment
we
landed
and
cause
us
both
to
be
shot
upon
the
beach
without
allowing
more
contact
than
might
be
absolutely
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
making
us
stand
fire
but
i
also
firmly
believed
that
the
pasha
would
not
see
the
befitting
line
of
conduct
nearly
so
well
as
i
did
and
that
even
if
he
did
know
his
duty
he
would
hardly
succeed
in
finding
resolution
enough
to
perform
it
we
ordered
the
boat
to
be
got
in
readiness
and
the
officers
on
shore
seeing
these
preparations
gathered
together
a
number
of
guards
who
assembled
upon
the
sands
we
saw
that
great
excitement
prevailed
and
that
messengers
were
continually
going
to
and
fro
between
the
shore
and
the
citadel
our
captain
out
of
compliment
to
his
excellency
had
provided
the
vessel
with
a
russian
which
he
had
hoisted
alternately
with
the
union
jack
and
we
agreed
that
we
would
attempt
our
disembarkation
under
this
the
russian
standard
i
was
glad
when
we
came
to
that
resolution
for
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
engage
the
honoured
flag
of
england
in
such
an
affair
as
that
which
we
were
undertaking
the
russian
ensign
was
therefore
committed
to
one
of
the
sailors
who
took
his
station
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
we
gave
particular
instructions
to
the
captain
of
the
brigantine
and
when
all
was
ready
the
general
and
i
with
our
respective
servants
got
into
the
boat
and
were
slowly
rowed
towards
the
shore
the
guards
gathered
together
at
the
point
for
which
we
were
making
but
when
they
saw
that
our
boat
went
on
without
altering
her
course
ceased
to
stand
very
none
of
them
ran
away
or
even
shrank
back
but
they
looked
as
if
pack
were
being
every
man
seeming
desirous
to
change
places
with
his
neighbour
they
were
still
at
their
post
however
when
our
oars
went
in
and
the
bow
of
our
boat
ran
up
upon
the
beach
the
general
was
lame
by
an
honourable
wound
received
at
borodino
and
could
not
without
some
assistance
get
out
of
the
boat
i
therefore
landed
the
first
my
instructions
to
the
captain
were
attended
to
with
the
most
perfect
accuracy
for
scarcely
had
my
foot
indented
the
sand
when
the
four
of
the
brigantine
quite
gravely
rolled
out
their
brute
thunder
precisely
as
i
had
expected
the
guards
and
all
the
people
who
had
gathered
about
them
gave
way
under
the
shock
produced
by
the
mere
sound
of
guns
and
we
were
all
allowed
to
disembark
with
the
least
molestation
we
immediately
formed
a
little
column
or
rather
as
i
should
have
called
it
a
procession
for
we
had
no
fighting
aptitude
in
us
and
were
only
trying
as
it
were
how
far
we
could
go
in
frightening
children
first
marched
the
sailor
with
the
russian
flag
of
war
bravely
flying
in
the
breeze
then
came
the
general
and
i
then
our
servants
and
lastly
if
i
rightly
recollect
two
more
of
the
brigantine
s
crew
our
so
exulted
in
his
honourable
office
and
bore
the
colours
aloft
with
so
much
of
pomp
and
dignity
that
i
found
it
exceedingly
hard
to
keep
a
grave
countenance
we
advanced
towards
the
castle
but
the
people
had
now
had
time
to
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
only
of
course
loaded
with
powder
and
they
could
not
help
seeing
not
only
the
numerical
weakness
of
our
party
but
the
very
slight
amount
of
wealth
and
resource
which
it
seemed
to
imply
they
began
to
hang
round
us
more
closely
and
just
as
this
reaction
was
beginning
the
general
who
was
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
asiatic
character
thoughtlessly
turned
round
in
order
to
speak
to
one
of
the
servants
the
effect
of
this
slight
move
was
magical
the
people
thought
we
were
going
to
give
way
and
instantly
closed
round
us
in
two
words
and
with
one
touch
i
showed
my
comrade
the
danger
he
was
running
and
in
the
next
instant
we
were
both
advancing
more
pompously
than
ever
some
minutes
afterwards
there
was
a
second
appearance
of
reaction
followed
again
by
wavering
and
indecision
on
the
part
of
the
pasha
s
people
but
at
length
it
seemed
to
be
understood
that
we
should
go
unmolested
into
the
audience
hall
constant
communication
had
been
going
on
between
the
receding
crowd
and
the
pasha
and
so
when
we
reached
the
gates
of
the
citadel
we
saw
that
preparations
were
made
for
giving
us
an
reception
parting
at
once
from
the
sailors
and
our
servants
the
general
and
i
were
conducted
into
the
audience
hall
and
there
at
least
i
suppose
the
pasha
hoped
that
he
would
confound
us
by
his
greatness
the
hall
was
nothing
more
than
a
large
whitewashed
room
oriental
potentates
have
a
pride
in
that
sort
of
simplicity
when
they
can
contrast
it
with
the
exhibition
of
power
and
this
the
pasha
was
able
to
do
for
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
was
filled
with
his
officers
these
men
of
whom
i
thought
there
were
about
fifty
or
sixty
were
all
handsomely
though
plainly
dressed
in
the
military
frockcoats
of
europe
they
stood
in
mass
and
so
as
to
present
a
hollow
front
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
at
which
the
pasha
sat
they
opened
a
narrow
lane
for
us
when
we
entered
and
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
they
again
closed
up
their
ranks
an
attempt
was
made
to
induce
us
to
remain
at
a
respectful
distance
from
his
mightiness
to
have
yielded
in
this
point
would
have
been
fatal
to
our
success
perhaps
to
our
lives
but
the
general
and
i
had
already
determined
upon
the
place
which
we
should
take
and
we
rudely
pushed
on
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
upon
the
divan
and
close
up
against
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
room
there
sat
the
pasha
his
limbs
gathered
in
the
whole
creature
coiled
up
like
an
adder
his
cheeks
were
deadly
pale
and
his
lips
perhaps
had
turned
white
for
without
moving
a
muscle
the
man
impressed
me
with
an
immense
idea
of
the
wrath
within
him
he
kept
his
eyes
inexorably
fixed
as
if
upon
vacancy
and
with
the
look
of
a
man
accustomed
to
refuse
the
prayers
of
those
who
sue
for
life
we
soon
discomposed
him
however
from
this
studied
fixity
of
feature
for
we
marched
straight
up
to
the
divan
and
sat
down
the
russian
close
to
the
pasha
and
i
by
the
side
of
the
russian
this
act
astonished
the
attendants
and
plainly
disconcerted
the
pasha
he
could
no
longer
maintain
the
glassy
stillness
of
the
eyes
which
he
had
affected
and
evidently
became
much
agitated
at
the
feet
of
the
satrap
there
stood
a
trembling
italian
this
man
was
a
sort
of
medico
in
the
potentate
s
service
and
now
in
the
absence
of
our
attendants
he
was
to
act
as
interpreter
the
pasha
caused
him
to
tell
us
that
we
had
openly
defied
his
authority
and
had
forced
our
way
on
shore
in
the
teeth
of
his
own
officers
up
to
this
time
i
had
been
the
planner
of
the
enterprise
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
when
all
would
depend
upon
able
and
earnest
speechifying
i
felt
at
once
the
immense
superiority
of
my
gallant
friend
and
gladly
left
to
him
the
whole
conduct
of
this
discussion
indeed
he
had
vast
advantages
over
me
not
only
by
his
superior
command
of
language
and
his
far
more
spirited
style
of
address
but
also
in
his
consciousness
of
a
good
cause
for
whilst
i
felt
myself
completely
in
the
wrong
his
excellency
had
really
worked
himself
up
to
believe
that
the
pasha
s
refusal
to
permit
our
landing
was
a
gross
outrage
and
insult
therefore
without
deigning
to
defend
our
conduct
he
at
once
commenced
a
spirited
attack
upon
the
pasha
the
poor
italian
doctor
translated
one
or
two
sentences
to
the
pasha
but
he
evidently
mitigated
their
import
the
russian
growing
warm
insisted
upon
his
attack
with
redoubled
energy
and
spirit
but
the
medico
instead
of
translating
began
to
shake
violently
with
terror
and
at
last
he
came
out
with
his
and
fairly
confessed
that
he
dared
not
interpret
fierce
words
to
his
master
now
then
at
a
time
when
everything
seemed
to
depend
upon
the
effect
of
speech
we
were
left
without
an
interpreter
but
this
very
circumstance
which
at
first
appeared
so
unfavourable
turned
out
to
be
advantageous
the
general
finding
that
he
could
not
have
his
words
translated
ceased
to
speak
in
italian
and
recurred
to
his
accustomed
french
he
became
eloquent
no
one
present
except
myself
understood
one
syllable
of
what
he
was
saying
but
he
had
drawn
forth
his
passport
and
the
energy
and
violence
with
which
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
the
graven
eagle
of
all
the
russias
began
to
make
an
impression
the
pasha
saw
at
his
side
a
man
not
only
free
from
every
the
least
pang
of
fear
but
raging
as
it
seemed
with
just
indignation
and
thenceforward
he
plainly
began
to
think
that
in
some
way
or
other
he
could
not
tell
how
he
must
certainly
have
been
in
the
wrong
in
a
little
time
he
was
so
much
shaken
that
the
italian
ventured
to
resume
his
interpretation
and
my
comrade
had
again
the
opportunity
of
pressing
his
attack
upon
the
pasha
his
argument
if
i
rightly
recollect
its
import
was
to
this
effect
if
the
vilest
jews
were
to
come
into
the
harbour
you
would
but
forbid
them
to
land
and
force
them
to
perform
quarantine
yet
this
is
the
very
course
o
pasha
which
your
rash
officers
dared
to
think
of
adopting
with
mad
and
reckless
men
would
have
actually
dealt
towards
a
russian
general
officer
and
an
english
gentleman
as
if
they
had
been
wretched
israelites
will
we
submit
to
such
an
indignity
his
imperial
majesty
knows
how
to
protect
his
nobles
from
insult
and
would
never
endure
that
a
general
of
his
army
should
be
treated
in
matter
of
quarantine
as
though
he
were
a
mere
eastern
jew
this
argument
told
with
great
effect
the
pasha
fairly
admitted
that
he
felt
its
weight
and
he
now
only
struggled
to
obtain
such
a
compromise
as
might
partly
save
his
dignity
he
wanted
us
to
perform
a
quarantine
of
one
day
for
form
s
sake
and
in
order
to
show
his
people
that
he
was
not
utterly
defied
but
finding
that
we
were
inexorable
he
not
only
abandoned
his
attempt
but
promised
to
supply
us
with
horses
when
the
discussion
had
arrived
at
this
happy
conclusion
and
coffee
were
brought
and
we
passed
i
think
nearly
an
hour
in
friendly
conversation
the
pasha
it
now
appeared
had
once
been
a
prisoner
of
war
in
russia
and
a
conviction
of
the
emperor
s
vast
power
necessarily
acquired
during
this
captivity
made
him
perhaps
more
alive
than
an
untravelled
turk
would
have
been
to
the
force
of
my
comrade
s
eloquence
the
pasha
now
gave
us
a
generous
feast
our
promised
horses
were
brought
without
much
delay
i
gained
my
loved
saddle
once
more
and
when
the
moon
got
up
and
touched
the
heights
of
taurus
we
were
joyfully
winding
our
way
through
the
first
of
his
rugged
defiles
appendix
the
home
of
lady
hester
stanhope
it
was
late
when
we
came
in
sight
of
two
high
conical
hills
on
one
of
which
stands
the
village
of
djouni
on
the
other
a
circular
wall
over
which
dark
trees
were
waving
and
this
was
the
place
in
which
lady
hester
stanhope
had
finished
her
strange
and
eventful
career
it
had
formerly
been
a
convent
but
the
pasha
of
sidon
had
given
it
to
the
who
converted
its
naked
walls
into
a
palace
and
its
wilderness
into
gardens
the
sun
was
setting
as
we
entered
the
enclosure
and
we
were
soon
scattered
about
the
outer
court
picketing
our
horses
rubbing
down
their
foaming
flanks
and
washing
out
their
wounds
the
buildings
that
constituted
the
palace
were
of
a
very
scattered
and
complicated
description
covering
a
wide
space
but
only
one
storey
in
height
courts
and
garden
stables
and
halls
of
audience
and
ladies
bowers
were
strangely
intermingled
heavy
weeds
were
growing
everywhere
among
the
open
portals
and
we
forced
our
way
with
difficulty
through
a
tangle
of
roses
and
jasmine
to
the
inner
court
here
choice
flowers
once
bloomed
and
fountains
played
in
marble
basins
but
now
was
presented
a
scene
of
the
most
melancholy
desolation
as
the
watchfire
blazed
up
its
gleam
fell
upon
masses
of
honeysuckle
and
woodbine
on
white
mouldering
walls
beneath
and
dark
waving
trees
above
while
the
group
of
mountaineers
who
gathered
round
its
light
with
their
long
beards
and
vivid
dresses
completed
the
strange
picture
the
clang
of
sword
and
spear
resounded
through
the
long
galleries
horses
neighed
among
bowers
and
boudoirs
strange
figures
hurried
to
and
fro
among
the
colonnades
shouting
in
arabic
english
and
italian
the
fire
crackled
the
startled
bats
flapped
their
heavy
wings
and
the
growl
of
distant
thunder
filled
up
the
pauses
in
the
rough
symphony
our
dinner
was
spread
on
the
floor
in
lady
hester
s
favourite
apartment
her
deathbed
was
our
sideboard
her
furniture
our
fuel
her
name
our
conversation
almost
before
the
meal
was
ended
two
of
our
party
had
dropped
asleep
over
their
trenchers
from
fatigue
the
druses
had
retired
from
the
haunted
precincts
to
their
village
and
and
i
went
out
into
the
garden
to
smoke
our
pipes
by
lady
hester
s
lonely
tomb
about
midnight
we
fell
asleep
upon
the
ground
wrapped
in
our
capotes
and
dreamed
of
ladies
and
tombs
and
prophets
till
the
neighing
of
our
horses
announced
the
dawn
after
a
hurried
breakfast
on
fragments
of
the
last
night
s
repast
we
strolled
out
over
the
extensive
gardens
here
many
a
broken
arbour
and
trellis
bending
under
masses
of
jasmine
and
honeysuckle
show
the
care
and
taste
that
were
once
lavished
on
this
wild
but
beautiful
hermitage
a
surrounded
by
an
enclosure
of
roses
run
wild
lies
in
the
midst
of
a
grove
of
myrtle
and
bay
trees
this
was
lady
hester
s
favourite
resort
during
her
lifetime
and
now
within
its
silent
enclosure
after
life
s
fitful
fevers
he
sleeps
the
hand
of
ruin
has
dealt
very
sparingly
with
all
these
interesting
relics
the
pasha
s
power
by
day
and
the
fear
of
spirits
by
night
keep
off
marauders
and
though
made
free
with
broken
benches
and
fallen
doorposts
for
fuel
we
reverently
abstained
from
displacing
anything
in
the
establishment
except
a
few
roses
which
there
was
no
living
thing
but
bees
and
nightingales
to
regret
it
was
one
of
the
most
striking
and
interesting
spots
i
ever
witnessed
its
silence
and
beauty
its
richness
and
desolation
lent
to
it
a
touching
and
mysterious
character
that
suited
well
the
memory
of
that
strange
who
has
made
it
a
place
of
pilgrimage
even
in
palestine
the
pasha
of
sidon
presented
lady
hester
with
the
deserted
convent
of
mar
elias
on
her
arrival
in
his
country
and
this
she
soon
converted
into
a
fortress
garrisoned
by
a
band
of
albanians
her
only
attendants
besides
were
her
doctor
her
secretary
and
some
female
slaves
public
rumour
soon
busied
itself
with
such
a
personage
and
exaggerated
her
influence
and
power
it
is
even
said
that
she
was
crowned
queen
of
the
east
at
palmyra
by
fifty
thousand
arabs
she
certainly
exercised
almost
despotic
power
in
her
neighbourhood
on
the
mountain
and
what
was
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
proof
of
her
talents
she
prevailed
on
some
jews
to
advance
large
sums
of
money
to
her
on
her
note
of
hand
she
lived
for
many
years
beset
with
difficulties
and
anxieties
but
to
the
last
she
held

the

really
used
comparatively
rarely

only
in

by

is
of

closely
akin
to

and
scattered
over

particularly
near
the

frontier
this
accomplished
gentleman
subsequently
became
the
proprietor
of
an
hotel
which
was
long
the
principal
hostelry
of

the

the

has
been
burnt
down
the
continual
marriages
of
these
people
with
the
chosen
beauties
of

rather
the

over

after

only
two
or
three
skulls
are
now
left
embedded
in
masonry

now
told
in

a
servian
leader
during
the
karageorge
insurrection
when
hard
pressed
by
the
turks
fired
into
his
powder

blew
up
himself

his
followers
as
well
as
numbers
of
his
enemies
the
turks
in
order
to
intimidate
the
other
serbs
collected
the
heads
of
the
victims
and
built
of
them
a
tower
or
pyramid
in
when
nish
became

of

skulls
were

the
yashmak
you
know
is
not
a
mere
veil
but
rather
a
good
substantial
petticoat
applied
to
the
face
it
thoroughly
conceals
all
the
features
except
the
eyes
the
way
of
withdrawing
it
is
by
pulling
it
down
the
pipe
of
tranquillity
is
a
too
long
to
be
conveniently
carried
on
a
journey
the
possession
of
it
therefore
implies
that
its
owner
is
stationary
or
at
all
events
that
he
is
enjoying
a
long
repose
from
travel
the
structure
of
turkish
can
only
be
said
to
resemble
latin
in
the
general
sense
that
the
verb
comes
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
which
can
be
swelled
out
to
enormous
and
indeed
preposterous
dimensions
the
turk
of
the
old
school
thinks
that
a
letter
or
document
and
even
a
single
chapter
of
a
book
ought
to
consist
of
one
sentence
but
in
this
respect
there
has
been
considerable
improvement
of
late
and
modern
newspapers
and
light
literature
are
written
in
phrases
of
relatively
reasonable
length
longer
say
than
german
with
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
arabic
and
persian
words
the
osmanli
gets
few
opportunities
for
public
speaking
nowadays
but
it
is
said
that
the
turkish
parliament
in
furnished
a
very
creditable
oratorical
display
since
this
chapter
was
written
the
labours
of
schliemann
and
dorpfeld
have
excavated
hissarlik
commonly
considered
to
be
the
site
of
troy

some
prefer
to
identify
the
city

ruins
of

inland
hissarlik
is
a
huge
mound
in
a
singularly
desolate
plain
about
an
hour
s
ride
from
kum
kale
at
the
entrance
of
the
dardanelles
and
is
said
to
be
composed
of
the
ruins
of
no
less
than
eight
or
nine
cities
placed
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
of
the
older
layers
the
best
preserved
are
the
second
and
sixth
cities
there
are
no
statues
inscriptions
or
other
indications
so
that
the
structure
of
this
pile
of
dead
towns
is
excessively
difficult
to
understand
and
only
becomes
intelligible
when
explained
by
someone
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
course
of
the
excavations
for
in
order
to
reach
the
lower
layers
it
has
naturally
been
necessary
to
displace
the
upper
ones

sadly
importunate
in
offering
their
services
as
intermediaries
their
troublesome
conduct
has
led
to
the
custom
of
beating
them
in
the

streets
it
is
usual
for
europeans
to
carry
long
sticks
with
them
for
the
express
purpose
of
keeping
off
the
chosen
people
i
always
felt
ashamed
to
strike
the
poor
fellows
myself
but
i
confess
to
the
amusement
with
which
i
witnessed
the
observance
of
this
custom
by
other
people
the
jew
seldom
got
hurt
much

he
was
always
expecting
the
blow

was
ready
to
recede

moment

came

the
writer
advises
that

account

late
lady
hester
stanhope
except
those
who
may
already
chance
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
personage
to
whom
it
relates
the
chapter
which
has
been
written
and
printed
for
the
reasons
mentioned
in
the
preface
is
chiefly
filled
with
the
detailed
conversation
or
rather
discourse
of
a
highly
eccentric
gentlewoman
historically
the
death
did
not
occur
until
long
afterwards
i
am
told
that
in
youth
she
was
exceedingly
sallow
this
was
my
impression
at
the
time
of
writing
the
above
passage
an
impression
created
by
the
popular
and
uncontradicted
accounts
of
the
matter
as
well
as
by
the
tenor
of
lady
hester
s
conversation
i
have
now
some
reason
to
think
that
i
was
deceived
and
that
her
sway
in
the
desert
was
much
more
limited
than
i
had
supposed
she
seems
to
have
had
from
the
bedouins
a
fair
five
hundred
pounds
worth
of
respect
and
not
much
more
she
spoke
it
i
daresay
in
english
the
words
would
not
be
the
less
effective
for
being
spoken
in
an
unknown
tongue
lady
hester
i
believe
never
learnt
to
speak
the
arabic
with
a
perfect
accent
the
proceedings
thus
described
to
me
by
lady
hester
as
having
taken
place
during
her
illness
were
afterwards
at
the
time
of
her
death
since
i
wrote
the
words
to
which
this
note
is
appended
i
received
from
warburton
an
interesting
account
of
the
heroine
s
death
or
rather
the
circumstances
attending
the
discovery
of
the
event
and
i
caused
it
to
be
printed
in
the
former
editions
of
this
work
i
must
now
give
up
the
borrowed
ornament
and
omit
my
extract
from
my
friend
s
letter

the
rightful
owner

reprinted
it

i
know
what
a
sacrifice
i
am
making
for
in
noticing
the
first
edition
of
this
book
reviewers
turned
aside
from
the
text
to
the
note
and
remarked
upon
the
interesting
information
which
warburton
s
letter
contained
this
narrative
is
reproduced
in
an
appendix
to
the
present
edition
in
a
letter
which
i
afterwards
received
from
lady
hester

incidentally
lord

that

was

from

good

excellent
with

blood

their
the
underscoring
of
the
word
ancient
is
by
the
writer
of
the
letter
who
had
certainly
no
great
love
or
veneration
for
the
french
of
the
present
day
she
did
not
consider
them
as
descended
from
her
favourite
stock

that

not

the
esteem
and
confidence
of
lady
hester
stanhope
his
adventures
in
the
levant
were
most
curious
and
interesting
the
greek
church
does
not
recognise
this
as
the
true
sanctuary
and
many
protestants
look
upon
all
the
traditions
by
which
it
is
attempted
to
ascertain
the
holy
places
of
palestine
as
utterly
fabulous
for
myself
i
do
not
mean
either
to
affirm
or
deny
the
correctness
of
the
opinion
which
has
fixed
upon
this
as
the
true
site
but
merely
to
mention
it
as
a
belief
entertained
without
question
by
my
brethren
of
the
latin
church
whose
guest
i
was
at
the
time
it
would
be
a
great
aggravation
of
the
trouble
of
writing
about
these
matters
if
i
were
to
stop
in
the
midst
of
every
sentence
for
the
purpose
of
saying
so
called
or
so
it
is
said
and
would
besides
sound
very
ungraciously
yet
i
am
anxious
to
be
literally
true
in
all
i
write
now
thus
it
is
that
i
mean
to
get
over
my
difficulty
whenever
in
this
great
bundle
of
papers
or
book
if
book
it
is
to
be
you
see
any
words
about
matters
of
religion
which
would
seem
to
involve
the
assertion
of
my
own
opinion
you
are
to
understand
me
just
as
if
one
or
other
of
the
qualifying
phrases
above
mentioned
had
been
actually
inserted
in
every
sentence
my
general
direction
for
you
to
construe
me
thus
will
render
all
that
i
write
as
strictly
and
actually
true
as
if
i
had
every
time
lugged
in
a
formal
declaration
of
the
fact
that
i
was
merely
expressing
the
notions
of
other
people
vino
d
shereef
tennyson
the
other
three
cities
held
holy
by
jews
are
jerusalem
hebron
and
safet
the
tented
arabs
are
no
doubt
very
bad
mohammedans
but
the
assumption
which
kinglake
seems
to
make
that
prostrations
are
essential
to
a
moslem
religious
ceremony
is
not
correct
the
form
of
prayer
called
in
turkey
namaz
which
ought
to
be
performed
by
every
devout
moslem
five
times
a
day
does
necessarily
involve
prostrations
in
which
the
forehead
touches
the
ground
but
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
though
doubtless
the
most
important
act
of
worship
mentioned
by
islam
in
the
present
case
the
ceremony
was
probably
a
blessing
which
is
generally
given
by
closing
the
eyes
and
uplifting
the
arms
with
the
hands
bent
back
and
the
palms
open
i
have
often
seen
such
benedictions
given
when
a
party
sets
out
for
a
pilgrimage
or
any
other
purpose
hadji
a
pilgrim
kinglake
might
have
added
that
mohammedans
admit
that
christ
worked
miracles
and
was
miraculously
born
of
a
virgin
they
do
not
however
believe
that
he
was
crucified
milnes
cleverly
goes
to
the
french
for
the
exact
word
which
conveys
the
impression
produced
by
the
voice
of
the
arabs
and
calls
them
un
peuple
there
is
some
semblance
of
bravado
in
my
manner
of
talking
about
the
plague
i
have
been
more
careful
to
describe
the
terrors
of
other
people
than
my
own
the
truth
is
that
during
the
whole
period
of
my
stay
at
cairo
i
remained
thoroughly
impressed
with
a
sense
of
my
danger
i
may
almost
say
that
i
lived
in
perpetual
apprehension
for
even
in
sleep
as
i
fancy
there
remained
with
me
some
faint
notion
of
the
peril
with
which
i
was
encompassed
but
fear
does
not
necessarily
damp
the
spirits
on
the
contrary
it
will
often
operate
as
an
excitement
giving
rise
to
unusual
animation
and
thus
it
affected
me
if
i
had
not
been
surrounded
at
this
time
by
new
faces
new
scenes
and
new
sounds
the
effect
produced
upon
my
mind
by
one
unceasing
cause
of
alarm
might
have
been
very
different
as
it
was
the
eagerness
with
which
i
pursued
my
rambles
among
the
wonders
of
egypt
was
sharpened
and
increased
by
the
sting
of
the
fear
of
death
thus
my
account
of
the
matter
plainly
conveys
an
impression
that
i
remained
at
cairo
without
losing
my
cheerfulness
and
buoyancy
of
spirits
and
this
is
the
truth
but
it
is
also
true
as
i
have
freely
confessed
that
my
sense
of
danger
during
the
whole
period
was
lively
and
continuous

these
answers
of
mine
as
given
above
are
not
meant
as
specimens
of
mere
french
but
of
that
fine
terse
nervous
continental
english
with
which
i
and
my
compatriots
make
our
way
through
europe
this
language
by

one
possessing
great
force
and
energy
and
is
not
without
its
literature
a
literature
of
the
very
highest
order

will
you
find
more
sturdy

downright
honest
and
noble

the

is
said
that
when
a
mussulman
finds
himself
attacked
by
the
plague
he
goes
and
takes
a
bath
the
couches
on
which
the
bathers
recline
would
carry

according

notions
of

p

mohammedans
commonly
believe
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
do
not
rest
in
peace
till
their
bodies
are
laid
in
the
tomb
hence
they
bury
the
corpse
as
quickly
as
possible
and
run
to
the
cemetery
in
order
to
shorten
the
interval
during
which
the
departed
spirit
is
kept
waiting
after
a
few
brief
prayers
at
the
graveside
the
mourners
retire
forty
paces
halt
and
pray
again
it
is
believed
that
at
this
moment
two
angels
visit
the
deceased
inquire
of
his
religious
belief
and
if
he
replies
in
the
words
of
the
formula
that
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
the
prophet
of
god
admit
him
not
exactly
to
paradise
but
to
a
very
tolerable
section
of
purgatory
mehemet
ali
invited
the
mamelukes
to
a
feast
and
murdered
them
whilst
preparing
to
enter
the
banquet
hall
it
is
not
strictly
lawful
to
sell
white
slaves
to
a
christian
the
difficulty
was
occasioned
by
the
immense
exertions
which
the
pasha
was
making
to
collect
camels
for
military
purposes
herodotus
in
an
after
age
stood
by
with
his
notebook
and
got
as
he
thought
the
exact
returns
of
all
the
rations
served
out
the
author
of
the
and
the
which
appeared
the
same
year
as
see
milman
s
of
the
first
edition
nablus
still
maintains
its
reputation
for
bigotry
this
is
an
appellation
not
implying
blame
but
merit
the
lies
which
it
purports
to
affiliate
are
feints
and
cunning
stratagems
rather
than
the
baser
kind
of
falsehoods
the
expression
in
short
has
nearly
the
same
meaning
as
the
english
word
the
of
april
this
was
no
doubt
the
case
in
this
particular
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
april
is
the
mohammedan
new
year
s
day
the
moslem
religious
year
consists
of
twelve
lunar
months
and
is
eleven
days
shorter
than
the
christian
year
hence
if
in
one
year
muharrem
the
first
month
falls
on
april
it
would
fall
on
april
the
next
in
consequence
of
the
great
inconveniences
of
this
mode
of
reckoning
turks
adopt
for
secular
matters
another
era
called
the
financial
year
which
starts
from
the
hijra
but
has
solar
months
but
feasts
and
fasts
are
fixed
by
the
lunar
year
so
that
the
month
of
ramazan
rotates
through
all
the
seasons
the
statements
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
are
altogether
inaccurate
from
the
religious
point
of
view
a
good
mohammedan
is
as
much
and
more
bound
than
a
christian
to
encourage
any
form
of
missionary
enterprise
seeing
that
all
are
destined
to
inevitable
damnation
from
the
legal
and
practical
point
of
view
the
exercise
of
all
religions
is
nominally
free
in
turkey
and
it
is
therefore
illegal
to
convert
a
christian
at
the
point
of
the
sword
but
it
will
be
sufficient
to
remind
the
reader
that
during
the
massacres
of
many
thousands
of
armenians
turned
mohammedans
and
that
those
who
wished
to
subsequently
return
to
their
old
religion
found
great
difficulty
in
doing
so
as
a
rule
turks
despise
the
christian
races
too
much
to
take
any
trouble
about
converting
them
but
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
conversions
are
illegal
on
the
contrary
they
are
fairly
frequent
and
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
person
converted
should
state
publicly
that
his
change
of
religion
is
due
to
his
own
free
will
cases
of
young
girls
embracing
islam
are
not
rare
according
to
the
law
minors
wishing
to
become
moslems
must
be
taken
to
the
house
of
a
respectable
person
where
a
priest
of
their
own
religion
can
have
access
to
them
and
their
change
of
faith
is
not
legal
until
they
are
of
age
which
means
in
the
case
of
a
girl
twelve
or
thirteen
but
in
practice
every
effort
is
made
to
isolate
them
in
such
cases
from
their
friends
and
surround
them
with
mohammedans
these
are
the
names
given
by
the
prophet
to
certain
chapters
of
the
koran
it
was
after
the
interview
which
i
am
talking
of
and
not
from
the
jews
themselves
that
i
learnt
this
fact
an
enterprising
american
traveller
everett
lately
conceived
the
bold
project
of
penetrating
to
the
university
of
oxford
and
this
notwithstanding
that
he
had
been
in
his
infancy
they
begin
very
young
those
americans
a
unitarian
preacher
having
a
notion
it
seems
that
the
ambassadorial
character
would
protect
him
from
insult
he
adopted
the
stratagem
of
procuring
credentials
from
his
government
as
minister
plenipotentiary
at
the
court
of
her
britannic
majesty
he
also
wore
the
exact
costume
of
a
trinitarian
but
all
his
contrivances
were
vain
oxford
disdained
and
rejected
and
insulted
him
not
because
he
represented
a
swindling
community
but
because
that
his
infantine
sermons
were
strictly
remembered
against
him
the
enterprise
failed
the
which
i
saw
were
all
of
the
kind
we
call
damask
they
grow
to
an
immense
height
and
size
a
dragoman
never
interprets
in
terms
the
courteous
language
of
the
east
this
place
which
is
commonly
called
adalia
antalia
in
turkish
is
now
a
port
in
the
province
of
konia
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
the
name
varied
between
attalie
or
attalia
and
sattalie
sattalia
as
it
seems
clear
that
it
is
derived
from
the
founder
king
attalus
the
s
must
be
a
later
addition
and
is
perhaps
to
be
identified
with
the
greek
preposition
which
is
responsible
for
such
forms
as
istambol
την
a
title
signifying
transcender
or
conqueror
of
satalieh
sataliefsky
is
merely
an
adjective
derived
from
satalieh
and
means
the
satalian
just
as
zabalkansky
means
the
i
mention
this
because
in
both
cases
kinglake
gives
the
translation
transcender
of
the
balkans
or
satalieh
spelt
attalia
and
sometimes
adalia
in
english
books
and
maps
while
lady
hester
stanhope
lived
although
numbers
visited
the
convent
she
almost
invariably
refused
admittance
to
strangers
she
assigned
as
a
reason
the
use
which
de
lamartine
had
made
of
his
interview
who
passed
some
weeks
at
djouni
told
me
that
when
lady
hester
read
his
account
of
this
interview
she
exclaimed
it
is
all
false
we
did
not
converse
together
for
more
than
five
minutes
but
no
matter
no
traveller
hereafter
shall
betray
or
forge
my
