of

in

introduction
victor
hugo
was
thinking
much
of
æschylus
and
his
prometheus
at
the
time
he
conceived
the
figure
of
gilliatt
heroic
warrer
with
the
elements
but
it
is
to
a
creature
of
the
gothic
mind
like
byron
manfred
and
not
to
any
earlier
or
classic
type
of
the
eternal
rebellion
against
fate
or
time
or
circumstance
that
hugo
readers
will
be
tempted
to
turn
for
the
fellow
to
his
guernsey
hero
my
joy
was
in
the
wilderness
to
breathe
the
difficult
air
of
the
iced
mountain
top
where
the
birds
dare
not
build
nor
insects
wing
flit
the
herbless
granite
or
to
plunge
into
the
torrent
and
to
roll
along
on
the
swift
whirl
of
the
wave
of
or
ocean
in
their
flow
the
island
of
guernsey
was
gilliatt
alp
and
where
he
too
had
his
avalanches
waiting
to
fall
like
foam
from
the
round
ocean
of
old
hell
and
as
byron
figured
his
own
revolt
against
the
bonds
in
manfred
so
hugo
being
in
exile
put
himself
with
lyrical
and
rhetorical
impetuosity
into
the
island
marcou
and
child
of
destiny
that
he
concocted
with
a
little
sand
and
a
little
blood
and
a
deal
of
fantasy
in
the
years
and
there
is
a
familiar
glimpse
of
the
hugo
household
to
be
had
in
the
first
winter
of
its
transference
to
the
channel
islands
years
before
was
written
which
betrays
the
mood
from
which
finally
sprang
this
concrete
fable
of
the
it
was
the
end
of
november
and
a
father
and
his
younger
son
sat
in
a
room
of
a
house
of
marine
terrace
jersey
a
plain
unpicturesque
house
square
hard
in
outline
and
newly
whitewashed
methodism
said
hugo
in
stones
and
mortar
outside
its
windows
the
rain
fell
and
the
wind
blew
the
house
was
like
a
thing
benumbed
by
the
angry
noise
the
two
inmates
sat
plunged
in
thought
possibly
thinking
of
the
sad
significance
of
these
beginnings
of
winter
and
of
exile
which
had
arrived
together
at
length
the
son
françois
hugo
asked
the
father
what
he
meant
to
do
during
their
exile
which
he
had
already
predicted
would
be
long
the
father
said
i
shall
look
at
the
sea
then
came
a
silence
broken
by
a
question
as
to
what
the
son
would
do
to
which
he
replied
that
he
would
translate
shakespeare
victor
hugo
own
study
or
eulogy
of
shakespeare
was
written
as
a
preamble
to
his
son
translation
of
the
plays
it
is
not
too
much
to
connect
the
new
and
ample
creative
work
that
followed
including
his
great
novel
of
revolution
and
his
poems
in
légende
des
first
series
with
the
double
artistic
stimulus
gained
from
this
conditioned
solitude
and
his
closer
acquaintance
with
the
dramatic
mind
of
that
giant
of
the
great
art
of
the
ages
as
he
termed
our
english
poet
in
the
book
already
quoted
from
the
shakespeare
book
is
dated
from
hauteville
house
from
the
same
quarters
march
the
hugos
had
perforce
suddenly
left
jersey
for
guernsey
in
owing
to
the
gibes
and
flouts
of
an
unlucky
revolutionary
jersey
journal
at
the
two
governments
victor
hugo
being
already
a
marked
man
for
his
pains
the
guernsey
house
he
inhabited
for
so
many
years
had
a
spacious
study
in
its
upper
story
with
a
large
window
free
to
the
sun
and
to
the
sea
here
he
wrote
tirelessly
tremendously
as
his
custom
was
beginning
betimes
in
the
early
morning
and
writing
on
till
the
time
for
his
standing
at
a
tall
desk
to
write
in
his
you
must
turn
to
certain
of
his
poems
and
to
the
pages
of
and
for
the
mental
colours
and
phantasmagoria
of
those
days
and
years
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
resuming
an
immense
amount
of
criticism
of
his
romances
and
of
this
story
in
particular
the
defects
on
the
side
of
dramatic
and
true
to
be
found
in
but
it
is
more
helpful
in
turning
to
a
to
know
what
has
been
said
unreservedly
in
its
favour
hugo
greatest
appreciator
was
superlative
in
his
praise
and
it
need
hardly
be
explained
that
it
was
swinburne
who
brought
his
tribute
to
the
romance
of
gilliatt
also
after
positing
the
parallel
claims
of
hugo
five
chief
romances
of
the
five
they
were
not
he
said
to
be
comparatively
classified
in
order
of
merit
but
i
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
say
without
fear
of
deserved
rebuke
that
none
is
to
me
personally
a
treasure
of
greater
price
than
travailleurs
de
la
the
splendid
energy
of
the
book
makes
the
superhuman
energy
of
the
hero
seem
not
only
possible
but
natural
and
his
triumph
over
all
physical
impossibilities
not
only
natural
but
inevitable
swinburne
love
for
the
channel
islands
and
his
poems
inspired
by
them
were
mainly
due
as
we
know
to
hugo
life

his

christmas
day
in
the
year
was
somewhat
remarkable
in
the
island
of
guernsey
snow
fell
on
that
day
in
the
channel
islands
a
frosty
winter
is
uncommon
and
a
fall
of
snow
is
an
event
on
that
christmas
morning
the
road
which
skirts
the
seashore
from
peter
port
to
the
vale
was
clothed
in
white
from
midnight
till
the
break
of
day
the
snow
had
been
falling
towards
nine
a
little
after
the
rising
of
the
wintry
sun
as
it
was
too
early
yet
for
the
church
of
england
folks
to
go
to
sampson
or
for
the
wesleyans
to
repair
to
eldad
chapel
the
road
was
almost
deserted
throughout
that
portion
of
the
highway
which
separates
the
first
from
the
second
tower
only
three
could
be
seen
these
were
a
child
a
man
and
a
woman
walking
at
a
distance
from
each
other
these
wayfarers
had
no
visible
connection
the
child
a
boy
of
about
eight
years
old
had
stopped
and
was
looking
curiously
at
the
wintry
scene
the
man
walked
behind
the
woman
at
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
paces
like
her
he
was
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
church
of
sampson
the
appearance
of
the
man
who
was
still
young
was
something
between
that
of
a
workman
and
a
sailor
he
wore
his
clothes
a
kind
of
guernsey
shirt
of
coarse
brown
stuff
and
trousers
partly
concealed
by
tarpaulin
leggings
a
costume
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
notwithstanding
the
holy
day
he
was
going
to
no
place
of
worship
his
heavy
shoes
of
rough
leather
with
their
soles
covered
with
large
nails
left
upon
the
snow
as
he
walked
a
print
more
like
that
of
a
prison
lock
than
the
foot
of
a
man
the
woman
on
the
contrary
was
evidently
dressed
for
church
she
wore
a
large
mantle
of
black
silk
wadded
under
which
she
had
coquettishly
adjusted
a
dress
of
irish
poplin
trimmed
alternately
with
white
and
pink
but
for
her
red
stockings
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
parisian
she
walked
on
with
a
light
and
free
step
so
little
suggestive
of
the
burden
of
life
that
it
might
easily
be
seen
that
she
was
young
her
movements
possessed
that
subtle
grace
which
indicates
the
most
delicate
of
all
transitions
that
soft
intermingling
as
it
were
of
two
twilights
the
passage
from
the
condition
of
a
child
to
that
of
womanhood
the
man
seemed
to
take
no
heed
of
her
suddenly
near
a
group
of
oaks
at
the
corner
of
a
field
and
at
the
spot
called
the
basses
maisons
she
turned
and
the
movement
seemed
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
man
she
stopped
seemed
to
reflect
a
moment
then
stooped
and
the
man
fancied
that
he
could
discern
that
she
was
tracing
with
her
finger
some
letters
in
the
snow
then
she
rose
again
went
on
her
way
at
a
quicker
pace
turned
once
more
this
time
smiling
and
disappeared
to
the
left
of
the
roadway
by
the
footpath
under
the
hedges
which
leads
to
the
ivy
castle
when
she
had
turned
for
the
second
time
the
man
had
recognised
her
as
déruchette
a
charming
girl
of
that
neighbourhood
the
man
felt
no
need
of
quickening
his
pace
and
some
minutes
later
he
found
himself
near
the
group
of
oaks
already
he
had
ceased
to
think
of
the
vanished
déruchette
and
if
at
that
moment
a
porpoise
had
appeared
above
the
water
or
a
robin
had
caught
his
eye
in
the
hedges
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
passed
on
his
way
but
it
happened
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
his
gaze
fell
mechanically
upon
the
spot
where
the
girl
had
stopped
two
little
footprints
were
there
plainly
visible
and
beside
them
he
read
this
word
evidently
written
by
her
in
the
snow
gilliatt
it
was
his
own
name
he
lingered
for
awhile
motionless
looking
at
the
letters
the
little
footprints
and
the
snow
and
then
walked
on
evidently
in
a
thoughtful
mood
ii
the

gilliatt
lived
in
the
parish
of
sampson
he
was
not
liked
by
his
neighbours
and
there
were
reasons
for
that
fact
to
begin
with
he
lived
in
a
queer
kind
of
haunted
dwelling
in
the
islands
of
jersey
and
guernsey
sometimes
in
the
country
but
often
in
streets
with
many
inhabitants
you
will
come
upon
a
house
the
entrance
to
which
is
completely
barricaded
holly
bushes
obstruct
the
doorway
hideous
boards
with
nails
conceal
the
windows
below
while
the
casements
of
the
upper
stories
are
neither
closed
nor
open
for
all
the
are
barred
but
the
glass
is
broken
if
there
is
a
little
yard
grass
grows
between
its
stones
and
the
parapet
of
its
wall
is
crumbling
away
if
there
is
a
garden
it
is
choked
with
nettles
brambles
and
hemlock
and
strange
insects
abound
in
it
the
chimneys
are
cracked
the
roof
is
falling
in
so
much
as
can
be
seen
from
without
of
the
rooms
presents
a
dismantled
appearance
the
woodwork
is
rotten
the
stone
mildewed
the
paper
of
the
walls
has
dropped
away
and
hangs
loose
until
it
presents
a
history
of
the
bygone
fashions
of
the
scrawling
patterns
of
the
time
of
the
empire
the

the

be

such
houses
are
considered
to
be
haunted
satan
is
popularly
believed
to
visit
them
by
night
houses
are
like
the
human
beings
who
inhabit
them
they
become
to
their
former
selves
what
the
corpse
is
to
the
living
body
a
superstitious
belief
among
the
people
is
sufficient
to
reduce
them
to
this
state
of
death
then
their
aspect
is
terrible
these
ghostly
houses
are
common
in
the
channel
islands
the
rural
and
maritime
populations
are
easily
moved
with
notions
of
the
active
agency
of
the
powers
of
evil
among
the
channel
isles
and
on
the
neighbouring
coast
of

the
ideas
of
the
people
on
this
subject
are
deeply
rooted
in
their
view
beelzebub

the

fishermen
who

have
many
precautions
to
take
at
sea
by
reason
of
the
illusions
with
which
satan
environs
them
it
has
long
been
an
article
of
popular
faith
that
saint
maclou
inhabited
the
great
square
rock
called
ortach
in
the
sea
between
aurigny
and
the
casquets
and
many
old
sailors
used
to
declare
that
they
had
often
seen
him
there
seated
and
reading
in
a
book
accordingly
the
sailors
as
they
passed
were
in
the
habit
of
kneeling
many
times
before
the
ortach
rock
until
the
day
when
the
fable
was
destroyed
and
the
truth
took
its
place
for
it
has
been
discovered
and
is
now
well
established
that
the
lonely
inhabitant
of
the
rock
is
not
a
saint
but
a
devil
this
evil
spirit
whose
name
is
jochmus
had
the
impudence
to
pass
himself
off
for
many
centuries
as
saint
maclou
even
the
church
herself
is
not
proof
against
snares
of
this
kind
the
demons
raguhel
oribel
and
tobiel
were
regarded
as
saints
until
the
year
when
pope
zachary
having
at
length
exposed
them
turned
them
out
of
saintly
company
this
sort
of
weeding
of
the
saintly
calendar
is
certainly
very
useful
but
it
can
only
be
practised
by
very
accomplished
judges
of
devils
and
their
ways
the
old
inhabitants
of
these
parts
relate
though
all
this
refers
to
bygone
times
that
the
catholic
population
of
the
norman
archipelago
was
once
though
quite
involuntarily
even
in
more
intimate
correspondence
with
the
powers
of
darkness
than
the
huguenots
themselves
how
this
happened
however
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
but
it
is
certain
that
the
people
suffered
considerable
annoyance
from
this
cause
it
appears
that
satan
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
catholics
and
sought
their
company
a
good
deal
a
circumstance
which
has
given
rise
to
the
belief
that
the
devil
is
more
catholic
than
protestant
one
of
his
most
insufferable
familiarities
consisted
in
paying
nocturnal
visits
to
married
catholics
in
bed
just
at
the
moment
when
the
husband
had
fallen
fast
asleep
and
the
wife
had
begun
to
doze
a
fruitful
source
of
domestic
trouble
patouillet
was
of
opinion
that
a
faithful
biography
of
voltaire
ought
not
to
be
without
some
allusion
to
this
practice
of
the
evil
one
the
truth
of
all
this
is
perfectly
well
known
and
described
in
the
forms
of
excommunication
in
the
rubric
erroribus
nocturnis
et
de
semine
the
practice
was
raging
particularly
at
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
probably
as
a
punishment
for
the
revolution
for
the
evil
consequences
of
revolutionary
excesses
are
incalculable
however
this
may
have
been
it
is
certain
that
this
possibility
of
a
visit
from
the
demon
at
night
when
it
is
impossible
to
see
distinctly
or
even
in
slumber
caused
much
embarrassment
among
orthodox
dames
the
idea
of
giving
to
the
world
a
voltaire
was
by
no
means
a
pleasant
one
one
of
these
in
some
anxiety
consulted
her
confessor
on
this
extremely
difficult
subject
and
the
best
mode
for
timely
discovery
of
the
cheat
the
confessor
replied
in
order
to
be
sure
that
it
is
your
husband
by
your
side
and
not
a
demon
place
your
hand
upon
his
head
if
you
find
horns
you
may
be
sure
there
is
something
wrong
but
this
test
was
far
from
satisfactory
to
the
worthy
dame
gilliatt
house
had
been
haunted
but
it
was
no
longer
in
that
condition
it
was
for
that
reason
however
only
regarded
with
more
suspicion
no
one
learned
in
demonology
can
be
unaware
of
the
fact
that
when
a
sorcerer
has
installed
himself
in
a
haunted
dwelling
the
devil
considers
the
house
sufficiently
occupied
and
is
polite
enough
to
abstain
from
visiting
there
unless
called
in
like
the
doctor
on
some
special
occasion
this
house
was
known
by
the
name
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
it
was
situated
at
the
extremity
of
a
little
promontory
rather
of
rock
than
of
land
forming
a
small
harbourage
apart
in
the
creek
of
houmet
paradis
the
water
at
this
spot
is
deep
the
house
stood
quite
alone
upon
the
point
almost
separated
from
the
island
and
with
just
sufficient
ground
about
it
for
a
small
garden
which
was
sometimes
inundated
by
the
high
tides
between
the
port
of
sampson
and
the
creek
of
houmet
paradis
rises
a
steep
hill
surmounted
by
the
block
of
towers
covered
with
ivy
and
known
as
vale
castle
or
the
château
de
so
that
at
sampson
the
bû
de
la
rue
was
shut
out
from
sight
nothing
is
commoner
than
sorcerers
in
guernsey
they
exercise
their
profession
in
certain
parishes
in
profound
indifference
to
the
enlightenment
of
the
nineteenth
century
some
of
their
practices
are
downright
criminal
they
set
gold
boiling
they
gather
herbs
at
midnight
they
cast
sinister
looks
upon
the
people
cattle
when
the
people
consult
them
they
send
for
bottles
containing
water
of
the
sick
and
they
are
heard
to
mutter
mysteriously
the
water
has
a
sad
look
in
march
one
of
them
discovered
in
water
of
this
kind
seven
demons
they
are
universally
feared
another
only
lately
bewitched
a
baker
as
well
as
his
oven
another

the
diabolical
wickedness
to
wafer
and
seal
up
envelopes
containing
nothing
inside
another
went
so
far
as
to
have
on
a
shelf
three
bottles
labelled
b
these
monstrous
facts
are
well
authenticated
some
of
these
sorcerers
are
obliging
and
for
two
or
three
guineas
will
take
on
themselves
the
complaint
from
which
you
are
suffering
then
they
are
seen
to
roll
upon
their
beds
and
to
groan
with
pain
and
while
they
are
in
these
agonies
the
believer
exclaims
there
i
am
well
again
others
cure
all
kinds
of
diseases
by
merely
tying
a
handkerchief
round
the
patient
loins
a
remedy
so
simple
that
it
is
astonishing
that
no
one
had
yet
thought
of
it
in
the
last
century
the
cour
royale
of
guernsey
bound
such
folks
upon
a
heap
of
fagots
and
burnt
them
alive
in
these
days
it
condemns
them
to
eight
weeks
imprisonment
four
weeks
on
bread
and
water
and
the
remainder
of
the
term
in
solitary
confinement
alterna
the
last
instance
of
burning
sorcerers
in
guernsey
took
place
in
the
city
authorities
devoted
one
of
its
squares
the
carrefour
du
bordage
to
that
ceremony
between
and
eleven
sorcerers
thus
suffered
at
this
spot
as
a
rule
the
criminals
made
confession
of
their
guilt
torture
was
used
to
assist
their
confession
the
carrefour
du
bordage
has
indeed
rendered
many
other
services
to
society
and
religion
it
was
here
that
heretics
were
brought
to
the
stake
under
queen
mary
among
other
huguenots
burnt
here
were
a
mother
and
two
daughters
the
name
of
this
mother
was
perrotine
massy
one
of
the
daughters
was
and
was
delivered
of
a
child
even
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
as
the
old
chronicle
expresses
it

iii
for
your
wife
when
you
marry
we
must
return
to
gilliatt
the
country
people
told
how
towards
the
close
of
the
great
revolution
a
woman
bringing
with
her
a
little
child
came
to
live
in
guernsey
she
was
english
or
perhaps
french
she
had
a
name
which
the
guernsey
pronunciation
and
the
country
folks
bad
spelling
had
finally
converted
into
gilliatt
she
lived
alone
with
the
child
which
according
to
some
was
a
nephew
according
to
others
a
son
or
grandson
according
to
others
again
a
strange
child
whom
she
was
protecting
she
had
some
means
enough
to
struggle
on
in
a
poor
way
she
had
purchased
a
small
plot
of
ground
at
la
sergentée
and
another
at
la
roque
crespel
near
rocquaine
the
house
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
was
haunted
at
this
period
for
more
than
thirty
years
no
one
had
inhabited
it
it
was
falling
into
ruins
the
garden
so
often
invaded
by
the
sea
could
produce
nothing
besides
noises
and
lights
seen
there
at
the
house
had
this
mysterious
peculiarity
any
one
who
should
leave
there
in
the
evening
upon
the
mantelpiece
a
ball
of
worsted
a
few
needles
and
a
plate
filled
with
soup
would
assuredly
find
in
the
morning
the
soup
consumed
the
plate
empty
and
a
pair
of
mittens
ready
knitted
the
house
demon
included
was
offered
for
sale
for
a
few
pounds
sterling
the
stranger
woman
became
the
purchaser
evidently
tempted
by
the
devil
or
by
the
advantageous
bargain
she
did
more
than
purchase
the
house
she
took
up
her
abode
there
with
the
child
and
from
that
moment
peace
reigned
within
its
walls
the
bû
de
la
rue
has
found
a
fit
tenant
said
the
country
people
the
haunting
ceased
there
was
no
longer
any
light
seen
there
save
that
of
the
tallow
candle
of
the
new
comer
witch
candle
is
as
good
as
torch
the
proverb
satisfied
the
gossips
of
the
neighbourhood
the
woman
cultivated
some
acres
of
land
which
belonged
to
her
she
had
a
good
cow
of
the
sort
which
produces
yellow
butter
she
gathered
her
white
beans
cauliflowers
and
golden
drop
potatoes
she
sold
like
other
people
her
parsnips
by
the
tonneau
her
onions
by
the
hundred
and
her
beans
by
the
denerel
she
did
not
go
herself
to
market
but
disposed
of
her
crops
through
the
agency
of
guilbert
falliot
at
the
sign
of
the
abreveurs
of
sampson
the
register
of
falliot
bears
evidence
that
falliot
sold
for
her
on
one
occasion
as
much
as
twelve
bushels
of
rare
early
potatoes
the
house
had
been
meanly
repaired
but
sufficiently
to
make
it
habitable
it
was
only
in
very
bad
weather
that
the
found
their
way
through
the
ceilings
of
the
rooms
the
interior
consisted
of
a
suite
of
rooms
and
a
granary
overhead
the
was
divided
into
three
rooms
two
for
sleeping
and
one
for
meals
a
ladder
connected
it
with
the
granary
above
the
woman
attended
to
the
kitchen
and
taught
the
child
to
read
she
did
not
go
to
church
or
chapel
which
all
things
considered
led
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
be
french
not
to
go
to
a
place
of
worship
the
circumstance
was
grave
in
short
the
new
comers
were
a
puzzle
to
the
neighbourhood
that
the
woman
was
french
seemed
probable
volcanoes

forth
stones
and

so
families
are

were
from

some
in

some
in

some
in

the
people
of
the
country
view
them
with
surprise
and
curiosity
whence
come
these
strange
faces
yonder
mountain
smoking
with
revolutionary
fires
casts
them
out
these
barren
aërolites
these
famished
and
ruined
people
these
footballs
of
destiny
are
known
as
refugees
émigrés
adventurers
if
they
sojourn
among
strangers
they
are
tolerated
if
they
depart
there
is
a
feeling
of
relief
sometimes
these
wanderers
are
harmless
inoffensive
people
strangers
at
least
as
regards
the
women
to
the
events
which
have
led
to
their
exile
objects
of
persecution
helpless
and
astonished
at
their
fate
they
take
root
again
somewhere
as
they
can
they
have
done
no
harm
to
any
one
and
scarcely
comprehend
the
destiny
that
has
befallen
them
so
thus
i
have
seen
a
poor
tuft
of
grass
uprooted
and
carried
away
by
the
explosion
of
a
mine
no
great
explosion
was
ever
followed
by
more
of
such
strays
than
the
first
french
revolution
the
strange
woman
whom
the
guernsey
folks
called
gilliatt
was
possibly
one
of
these
human
strays
the
woman
grew
older
the
child
became
a
youth
they
lived
alone
and
avoided
by
all
but
they
were
sufficient
for
each
other
et

this
was
another
of
the
generous
proverbs
which
the
neighbourhood
applied
to
them
meanwhile
the
youth
grew
to
manhood
and
then
as
the
old
and
withered
bark
falls
from
the
tree
the
mother
died
she
left
to
her
son
the
little

and
the
house
known
as
the
bû
de
la
rue
with
the
addition
as
the
official
inventory
said
of
one
hundred
guineas
in
gold
in
the
that
is
to
say
in
the
foot
of
a
stocking
the
house
was
already
sufficiently
furnished
with
two
oaken
chests
two
beds
six
chairs
and
a
table
besides
necessary
household
utensils
upon
a
shelf
were
some
books
and
in
the
corner
a
trunk
by
no
means
of
a
mysterious
character
which
had
to
be
opened
for
the
inventory
this
trunk
was
of
drab
leather
ornamented
with
brass
nails
and
little
stars
of
white
metal
and
it
contained
a
bride
outfit
new
and
complete
of
beautiful
dunkirk
linen
chemises
and
petticoats
and
some
silk
dresses
with
a
paper
on
which
was
written
in
the
handwriting
of
the
deceased
for
your
wife
when
you
marry
the
loss
of
his
mother
was
a
terrible
blow
for
the
young
man
his
disposition
had
always
been
unsociable
he
became
now
moody
and
sullen
the
solitude
around
him
was
complete
hitherto
it
had
been
mere
isolation
now
his
life
was
a
blank
while
we
have
only
one
companion
life
is
endurable
left
alone
it
seems
as
if
it
is
impossible
to
struggle
on
and
we
fall
back
in
the
race
which
is
the
first
sign
of
despair
as
time
rolls
on
however
we
discover
that
duty
is
a
series
of
compromises
we
contemplate
life
regard
its
end
and
submit
but
it
is
a
submission
which
makes
the
heart
bleed
gilliatt
was
young
and
his
wound
healed
with
time
at
that
age
sorrows
can
not
be
lasting
his
sadness
disappearing
by
slow
degrees
seemed
to
mingle
itself
with
the
scenes
around
him
to
draw
him
more
and
more
towards
the
face
of
nature
and
further
and
further
from
the
need
of
social
converse
and
finally
to
assimilate
his
spirit
more
completely
to
the
solitude
in
which
he
lived
iv
an
unpopular
man
gilliatt
as
we
have
said
was
not
popular
in
the
parish
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
antipathy
among
his
neighbours
the
reasons
for
it
were
abundant
to
begin
with
as
we
have
already
explained
there
was
the
strange
house
he
lived
in
then
there
was
his
mysterious
origin
who
could
that
woman
have
been
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
child
country
people
do
not
like
mysteries
when
they
relate
to
strange
sojourners
among
them
then
his
clothes
were
the
clothes
of
a
workman
while
he
had
although
certainly
not
rich
sufficient
to
live
without
labour
then
there
was
his
garden
which
he
succeeded
in
cultivating
and
from
which
he
produced
crops
of
potatoes
in
spite
of
the
stormy
equinoxes
and
then
there
were
the
big
books
which
he
kept
upon
a
shelf
and
read
from
time
to
time
more
reasons
why
did
he
live
that
solitary
life
the
bû
de
la
rue
was
a
kind
of
lazaretto
in
which
gilliatt
was
kept
in
a
sort
of
moral
quarantine
this
in
the
popular
judgment
made
it
quite
simple
that
people
should
be
astonished
at
his
isolation
and
should
hold
him
responsible
for
the
solitude
which
society
had
made
around
his
home
he
never
went
to
chapel
he
often
went
out
at
he
held
converse
with
sorcerers
he
had
been
seen
on
one
occasion
sitting
on
the
grass
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
on
his
features
he
haunted
the
druidical
stones
of
the
ancresse
and
the
fairy
caverns
which
are
scattered
about
in
that
part
it
was
generally
believed
that
he
had
been
seen
politely
saluting
the
roque
qui
chante
or
crowing
rock
he
bought
all
birds
which
people
brought
to
him
and
having
bought
them
set
them
at
liberty
he
was
civil
to
the
worthy
folks
in
the
streets
of
sampson
but
willingly
turned
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
them
if
he
could
he
often
went
out
on
fishing
expeditions
and
always
returned
with
fish
he
trimmed
his
garden
on
sundays
he
had
a
bagpipe
which
he
had
bought
from
one
of
the
highland
soldiers
who
are
sometimes
in
guernsey
and
on
which
he
played
occasionally
at
twilight
on
the
rocks
by
the
seashore
he
had
been
seen
to
make
strange
gestures
like
those
of
one
sowing
seeds
what
kind
of
treatment
could
be
expected
for
a
man
like
that
as
regards
the
books
left
by
the
deceased
woman
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
the
neighbours
were
particularly
suspicious
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
rector
of
sampson
when
he
visited
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
woman
funeral
had
read
on
the
backs
of
these
books
the
titles
by
voltaire
to
the
people
on
by
tissot
a
french
noble
an
émigré
who
had
retired
to
sampson
remarked
that
this
tissot
must
have
been
the
tissot
who
carried
the
head
of
the
princess
de
lamballe
upon
a
pike
the
reverend
gentleman
had
also
remarked
upon
one
of
these
books
the
highly
fantastic
and
terribly
significant
title
in
justice
to
gilliatt
however
it
must
be
added
that
this
volume
being
in
latin
a
language
which
it
is
doubtful
if
he
understood
the
young
man
had
possibly
never
read
it
but
it
is
just
those
books
which
a
man
possesses
but
does
not
read
which
constitute
the
most
suspicious
evidence
against
him
the
spanish
inquisition
have
deliberated
on
that
point
and
have
come
to
a
conclusion
which
places
the
matter
beyond
further
doubt
the
book
in
question
however
was
no
other
than
the
treatise
of
doctor
tilingius
upon
the
rhubarb
plant
published
in
germany
in
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
gilliatt
did
not
prepare
philters
and
unholy
decoctions
he
was
undoubtedly
in
possession
of
certain
phials
why
did
he
walk
abroad
at
evening
and
sometimes
even
at
midnight
on
the
cliffs
evidently
to
hold
converse
with
the
evil
spirits
who
by
night
frequent
the
seashores
enveloped
in
smoke
on
one
occasion
he
had
aided
a
witch
at
torteval
to
clean
her
chaise
this
was
an
old
woman
named
moutonne
gahy
when
a
census
was
taken
in
the
island
in
answer
to
a
question
about
his
calling
he
replied
fisherman
when
there
are
fish
to
catch
imagine
yourself
in
the
place
of
gilliatt
neighbours
and
admit
that
there
is
something
unpleasant
in
answers
like
this
poverty
and
wealth
are
comparative
terms
gilliatt
had
some
fields
and
a
house
his
own
property
compared
with
those
who
had
nothing
he
was
not
poor
one
day
to
test
this
and
perhaps
also
as
a
step
towards
a
correspondence
for
there
are
base
women
who
would
marry
a
demon
for
the
sake
of
riches
a
young
girl
of
the
neighbourhood
said
to
gilliatt
when
are
you
going
to
take
a
wife
neighbour
he
answered
i
will
take
a
wife
when
the
roque
qui
chante
takes
a
husband
this
roque
qui
chante
is
a
great
stone
standing
in
a
field
near
mons
lemézurier
de
fry
it
is
a
stone
of
a
highly
suspicious
character
no
one
knows
what
deeds
are
done
around
it
at
times
you
may
hear
there
a
cock
crowing
when
no
cock
is
near
an
extremely
disagreeable
circumstance
then
it
is
commonly
asserted
that
this
stone
was
originally
placed
in
the
field
by
the
elfin
people
known
as
who
are
the
same
as
the
at
night
when
it
thunders
if
you
should
happen
to
see
men
flying
in
the
lurid
light
of
the
clouds
or
on
the
rolling
waves
of
the
air
these
are
no
other
than
the
sarregousets
a
woman
who
lives
at
the
grand
mielles
knows
them
well
one
evening
when
some
sarregousets
happened
to
be
assembled
at
a
crossroad
this
woman
cried
out
to
a
man
with
a
cart
who
did
not
know
which
route
to
take
ask
them
your
way
they
are
civil
folks
and
always
ready
to
direct
a
stranger
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
woman
was
a
sorceress
the
learned
and
judicious
king
james
had
women
of
this
kind
boiled
and
then
tasting
the
water
of
the
cauldron
was
able
to
say
from
its
flavour
that
was
a
sorceress
or
that
was
not
one
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
kings
of
these
latter
days
no
longer
possess
a
talent
which
placed
in
so
strong
a
light
the
utility
of
monarchical
institutions
it
was
not
without
substantial
grounds
that
gilliatt
lived
in
this
odour
of
sorcery
one
midnight
during
a
storm
gilliatt
being
at
sea
alone
in
a
bark
on
the
coast
by
la
sommeilleuse
he
was
heard
to
ask
is
there
a
passage
sufficient
for
me
and
a
voice
cried
from
the
heights
above
passage
enough
steer
boldly
to
whom
could
he
have
been
speaking
if
not
to
those
who
replied
to
him
this
seems
something
like
evidence
another
time
one
stormy
evening
when
it
was
so
dark
that
nothing
could
be
distinguished
gilliatt
was
near
the
catiau
roque
a
double
row
of
rocks
where
witches
goats
and
other
diabolical
creatures
assemble
and
dance
on
fridays
and
here
it
is
firmly
believed
that
the
voice
of
gilliatt
was
heard
mingling
in
the
following
terrible
conversation
how
is
vesin
brovard
this
was
a
mason
who
had
fallen
from
the
roof
of
a
house
he
is
getting
better
ver
dia
he
fell
from
a
greater
height
than
that
of
yonder
peak
it
is
delightful
to
think
that
he
was
not
dashed
to
pieces
our
folks
had
a
fine
time
for
the
seaweed
gathering
last
week
ay
finer
than
i
believe
you
there
will
be
little
fish
at
the
market
it
blows
too
hard
they
ca
lower
their
nets
how
is
catherine
she
is
charming
catherine
was
evidently
the
name
of
a
sarregouset
according
to
all
appearance
gilliatt
had
business
on
hand
at
night
at
least
none
doubted
it
sometimes
he
was
seen
with
a
pitcher
in
his
hand
pouring
water
on
the
ground
now
water
cast
upon
the
ground
is
known
to
make
a
shape
like
that
of
devils
on
the
road
to
sampson
opposite
the
martello
tower
number
stand
three
stones
arranged
in
the
form
of
steps
upon
the
platform
of
those
stones
now
empty
stood
anciently
a
cross
or
perhaps
a
gallows
these
stones
are
full
of
evil
influences
staid
and
worthy
people
and
perfectly
credible
witnesses
testified
to
having
seen
gilliatt
at
this
spot
conversing
with
a
toad
now
there
are
no
toads
at
guernsey
the
share
of
guernsey
in
the
reptiles
of
the
channel
isles
consisting
exclusively
of
the
snakes
it
is
jersey
that
has
all
the
toads
this
toad
then
must
have
swum
from
the
neighbouring
island
in
order
to
hold
converse
with
gilliatt
the
converse
was
of
a
friendly
kind
these
facts
were
clearly
established
and
the
proof
is
that
the
three
stones
are
there
to
this
day
those
who
doubt
it
may
go
and
see
them
and
at
a
little
distance
there
is
also
a
house
on
which
the
may
read
this
inscription
dealer
in
cattle
alive
and
dead
old
cordage
iron
bones
and
tobacco
for
chewing
prompt
payment
for
goods
and
every
attention
given
to
orders
a
man
must
be
sceptical
indeed
to
contest
the
existence
of
those
stones
and
of
the
house
in
question
now
both
these
circumstances
were
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
gilliatt
only
the
most
ignorant
are
unaware
of
the
fact
that
the
greatest
danger
of
the
coasts
of
the
channel
islands
is
the
king
of
the
auxcriniers
no
inhabitant
of
the
seas
is
more
redoubtable
whoever
has
seen
him
is
certain
to
be
wrecked
between
one
michel
and
the
other
he
is
little
being
in
fact
a
dwarf
and
is
deaf
in
his
quality
of
king
he
knows
the
names
of
all
those
who
have
been
drowned
in
the
seas
and
the
spots
where
they
lie
he
has
a
profound
knowledge
of
that
great
graveyard
which
stretches
far
and
wide
beneath
the
waters
of
the
ocean
a
head
massive
in
the
lower
part
and
narrow
in
the
forehead
a
squat
and
corpulent
figure
a
skull
covered
with
warty
excrescences
long
legs
long
arms
fins
for
feet
claws
for
hands
and
a
countenance
such
are
the
chief
characteristics
of
this
king
of
the
waves
his
claws
have
palms
like
hands
his
fins
human
nails
imagine
a
spectral
fish
with
the
face
of
a
human
being
no
power
could
check
his
career
unless
he
could
be
exorcised
or
mayhap
fished
up
from
the
sea
meanwhile
he
continues
his
sinister
operations
nothing
is
more
unpleasant
than
an
interview
with
this
monster
amid
the
rolling
waves
and
breakers
or
in
the
thick
of
the
mist
the
sailor
perceives
sometimes
a
strange
creature
with
a
beetle
brow
wide
nostrils
flattened
ears
an
enormous
mouth
jaws
peaked
eyebrows
and
great
grinning
eyes
when
the
lightning
is
livid
he
appears
red
when
it
is
purple
he
looks
wan
he
has
a
stiff
spreading
beard
running
with
water
and
overlapping
a
sort
of
pelerine
ornamented
with
fourteen
shells
seven
before
and
seven
behind
these
shells
are
curious
to
those
who
are
learned
in
conchology
the
king
of
the
auxcriniers
is
only
seen
in
stormy
seas
he
is
the
terrible
harbinger
of
the
tempest
his
hideous
form
traces
itself
in
the
fog
in
the
squall
in
the
tempest
of
rain
his
breast
is
hideous
a
coat
of
scales
covers
his
sides
like
a
vest
he
rises
above
the
waves
which
fly
before
the
wind
twisting
and
curling
like
thin
shavings
of
wood
beneath
the
carpenter
plane
then
his
entire
form
issues
out
of
the
foam
and
if
there
should
happen
to
be
in
the
horizon
any
vessels
in
distress
pale
in
the
twilight
or
his
face
lighted
up
with
a
sinister
smile
he
dances
terrible
and
uncouth
to
behold
it
is
an
evil
omen
indeed
to
meet
him
on
a
voyage
at
the
period
when
the
people
of
sampson
were
particularly
excited
on
the
subject
of
gilliatt
the
last
persons
who
had
seen
the
king
of
the
auxcriniers
declared
that
his
pelerine
was
now
ornamented
with
only
thirteen
shells
thirteen
he
was
only
the
more
dangerous
but
what
had
become
of
the
fourteenth
had
he
given
it
to
some
one
no
one
would
say
positively
and
folks
confined
themselves
to
conjecture
but
it
was
an
undoubted
fact
that
a
certain
mons
lupin
mabier
of
godaines
a
man
of
property
paying
a
good
sum
to
the
land
tax
was
ready
to
depose
on
oath
that
he
had
once
seen
in
the
hands
of
gilliatt
a
very
remarkable
kind
of
shell
it
was
not
uncommon
to
hear
dialogues
like
the
following
among
the
country
people
i
have
a
fine
bull
here
neighbour
what
do
you
say
very
fine
neighbour
it
is
a
fact
tho
is
i
who
say
it
he
is
better
though
for
tallow
than
for
meat
ver
dia
are
you
sure
that
gilliatt
has
cast
his
eye
upon
it
gilliatt
would
stop
sometimes
beside
a
field
where
some
labourers
were
assembled
or
near
gardens
in
which
gardeners
were
engaged
and
would
perhaps
hear
these
mysterious
words
when
the
du
flourishes
reap
the
winter
rye
the

the

of

if
the

on
the

of

or
like
that
of

during

keep
your
eye
on

bloom
mow
the
meadows
when
the
flowers
open
the
frames
when
tobacco
fields
are
in
blossom
close
your
greenhouses
and
fearful
to
relate
these
occult
precepts
were
not
without
truth
those
who
put
faith
in
them
could
vouch
for
the
fact
one
night
in
the
month
of
june
when
gilliatt
was
playing
upon
his
bagpipe
upon
the
on
the
shore
of
the
demie
de
fontenelle
it
had
happened
that
the
mackerel
fishing
had
failed
one
evening
at
low
water
it
came
to
pass
that
a
cart
filled
with
seaweed
for
manure
overturned
on
the
beach
in
front
of
house
it
is
most
probable
that
he
was
afraid
of
being
brought
before
the
magistrates
for
he
took
considerable
trouble
in
helping
to
raise
the
cart
and
he
filled
it
again
himself
a
little
neglected
child
of
the
neighbourhood
being
troubled
with
vermin
he
had
gone
himself
to
peter
port
and
had
returned
with
an
ointment
with
which
he
rubbed
the
child
head
thus
gilliatt
had
removed
the
pest
from
the
poor
child
which
was
an
evidence
that
gilliatt
himself
had
originally
given
it
for
everybody
knows
that
there
is
a
certain
charm
for
giving
vermin
to
people
gilliatt
was
suspected
of
looking
into
wells
a
dangerous
practice
with
those
who
have
an
evil
eye
and
in
fact
at
arculons
near
port
the
water
of
a
well
became
unwholesome
the
good
woman
to
whom
this
well
belonged
said
to
gilliatt
look
here
at
this
water
and
she
showed
him
a
glassful
gilliatt
acknowledged
it
the
water
is
thick
he
said
that
is
true
the
good
woman
who
dreaded
him
in
her
heart
said
make
it
sweet
again
for
me
gilliatt
asked
her
some
questions
whether
she
had
a
stable
whether
the
stable
had
a
drain
whether
the
gutter
of
the
drain
did
not
pass
near
the
well
the
good
woman
replied
yes
gilliatt
went
into
the
stable
worked
at
the
drain
turned
the
gutter
in
another
direction
and
the
water
became
pure
again
people
in
the
country
round
might
think
what
they
pleased
a
well
does
not
become
foul
one
moment
and
sweet
the
next
without
good
cause
the
bottom
of
the
affair
was
involved
in
obscurity
and
in
short
it
was
difficult
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
gilliatt
himself
had
bewitched
the
water
on
one
occasion
when
he
went
to
jersey
it
was
remarked
that
he
had
taken
a
lodging
in
the
street
called
the
rue
des
alleurs
now
the
word
signifies
spirits
from
the
other
world
in
villages
it
is
the
custom
to
gather
together
all
these
little
hints
and
indications
of
a
man
career
and
when
they
are
gathered
together
the
total
constitutes
his
reputation
among
the
inhabitants
it
happened
that
gilliatt
was
once
caught
with
blood
issuing
from
his
nose
the
circumstances
appeared
grave
the
master
of
a
barque
who
had
sailed
almost
entirely
round
the
world
affirmed
that
among
the
tongusians
all
sorcerers
were
subject
to
bleeding
at
the
nose
in
fact
when
you
see
a
man
in
those
parts
bleeding
at
the
nose
you
know
at
once
what
is
in
the
wind
moderate
reasoners
however
remarked
that
the
characteristics
of
sorcerers
among
the
tongusians
may
possibly
not
apply
in
the
same
degree
to
the
sorcerers
of
guernsey
in
the
environs
of
one
of
the
michels
he
had
been
seen
to
stop
in
a
close
belonging
to
the
huriaux
skirting
the
highway
from
the
videclins
he
whistled
in
the
field
and
a
moment
afterwards
a
crow
alighted
there
a
moment
later
a
magpie
the
fact
was
attested
by
a
worthy
man
who
has
since
been
appointed
to
the
office
of
douzenier
of
the
douzaine
as
those
are
called
who
are
authorised
to
make
a
new
survey
and
register
of
the
fief
of
the
king
at
hamel
in
the
vingtaine
of
there
lived
some
old
women
who
were
positive
of
having
heard
one
morning
a
number
of
swallows
distinctly
calling
gilliatt
add
to
all
this
that
he
was
of
a
malicious
temper
one
day
a
poor
man
was
beating
an
ass
the
ass
was
obstinate
the
poor
man
gave
him
a
few
kicks
in
the
belly
with
his
wooden
shoe
and
the
ass
fell
gilliatt
ran
to
raise
the
unlucky
beast
but
he
was
dead
upon
this
gilliatt
administered
to
the
poor
man
a
sound
thrashing
another
day
gilliatt
seeing
a
boy
come
down
from
a
tree
with
a
brood
of
little
birds
newly
hatched
and
unfledged
he
took
the
brood
away
from
the
boy
and
carried
his
malevolence
so
far
as
even
to
take
them
back
and
replace
them
in
the
tree
some
took
up
the
boy
complaint
but
gilliatt
made
no
reply
except
to
point
to
the
old
birds
who
were
hovering
and
crying
plaintively
over
the
tree
as
they
looked
for
their
nest
he
had
a
weakness
for
birds
another
sign
by
which
the
people
recognise
a
magician
children
take
a
pleasure
in
robbing
the
nests
of
birds
along
the
cliff
they
bring
home
quantities
of
yellow
blue
and
green
eggs
with
which
they
make
rosaries
for
mantelpiece
ornaments
as
the
cliffs
are
peaked
they
sometimes
slip
and
are
killed
nothing
is
prettier
than
shutters
decorated
with
eggs
gilliatt
mischievous
ingenuity
had
no
end
he
would
climb
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
into
the
steep
places
of
the
sea
rocks
and
hang
up
bundles
of
hay
old
hats
and
all
kinds
of
scarecrows
to
deter
the
birds
from
building
there
and
as
a
consequence
to
prevent
the
children
from
visiting
those
spots
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
why
gilliatt
was
disliked
throughout
the
country
perhaps
nothing
less
could
have
been
expected
v
more
suspicious
facts
about
gilliatt
public
opinion
was
not
yet
quite
settled
with
regard
to
gilliatt
in
general
he
was
regarded
as
a
some
went
so
far
as
to
believe
him
to
be
a
a
cambion
is
the
child
of
a
woman
begotten
by
a
devil
when
a
woman
bears
to
her
husband
seven
male
children
consecutively
the
seventh
is
a
marcou
but
the
series
must
not
be
broken
by
the
birth
of
any
female
child
the
marcou
has
a
natural
imprinted
upon
some
part
of
his
body
for
which
reason
he
has
the
power
of
curing
scrofula
exactly
the
same
as
the
king
of
france
marcous
are
found
in
all
parts
of
france
but
particularly
in
the
orléanais
every
village
of
gâtinais
has
its
marcou
it
is
sufficient
for
the
cure
of
the
sick
that
the
marcou
should
breathe
upon
their
wounds
or
let
them
touch
his
the
night
of
good
friday
is
particularly
favourable
to
these
ceremonies
ten
years
ago
there
lived
at
ormes
in
gâtinais
one
of
these
creatures
who
was
nicknamed
the
beau
marcou
and
consulted
by
all
the
country
of
beauce
he
was
a
cooper
named
foulon
who
kept
a
horse
and
vehicle
to
put
a
stop
to
his
miracles
it
was
found
necessary
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
the
gendarmes
his
was
on
the
left
breast
other
marcous
have
it
in
different
parts
there
are
marcous
at
jersey
auvigny
and
at
guernsey
this
fact
is
doubtless
in
some
way
connected
with
the
rights
possessed
by
france
over
normandy
or
why
the
there
are
also
in
the
channel
islands
people
afflicted
with
scrofula
which
of
course
necessitates
a
due
supply
of
these
marcous
some
people
who
happened
to
be
present
one
day
when
gilliatt
was
bathing
in
the
sea
had
fancied
that
they
could
perceive
upon
him
a
interrogated
on
that
subject
he
made
no
reply
but
merely
burst
into
laughter
for
he
laughed
sometimes
like
other
men
from
that
time
however
no
one
ever
saw
him
bathe
he
bathed
thenceforth
only
in
perilous
and
solitary
places
probably
by
moonlight
a
thing
in
itself
somewhat
suspicious
those
who
obstinately
regarded
him
as
a
cambion
or
son
of
the
devil
were
evidently
in
error
they
ought
to
have
known
that
cambions
scarcely
exist
out
of
germany
but
the
vale
and
sampson
were
fifty
years
ago
places
remarkable
for
the
ignorance
of
their
inhabitants
to
fancy
that
a
resident
of
the
island
of
guernsey
could
be
the
son
of
a
devil
was
evidently
absurd
gilliatt
for
the
very
reason
that
he
caused
disquietude
among
the
people
was
sought
for
and
consulted
the
peasants
came
in
fear
to
talk
to
him
of
their
diseases
that
fear
itself
had
in
it
something
of
faith
in
his
powers
for
in
the
country
the
more
the
doctor
is
suspected
of
magic
the
more
certain
is
the
cure
gilliatt
had
certain
remedies
of
his
own
which
he
had
inherited
from
the
deceased
woman
he
communicated
them
to
all
who
had
need
of
them
and
would
never
receive
money
for
them
he
cured
whitlows
with
applications
of
herbs
a
liquor
in
one
of
his
phials
allayed
fever
the
chemist
of
sampson
or
as
they
would
call
him
in
france
thought
that
this
was
probably
a
decoction
of
jesuits
bark
the
more
generous
among
his
censors
admitted
that
gilliatt
was
not
so
bad
a
demon
in
his
dealings
with
the
sick
so
far
as
regarded
his
ordinary
remedies
but
in
his
character
of
a
marcou
he
would
do
nothing
if
persons
afflicted
with
scrofula
came
to
him
to
ask
to
touch
the
on
his
skin
he
made
no
other
answer
than
that
of
shutting
the
door
in
their
faces
he
persistently
refused
to
perform
any
miracles
a
ridiculous
position
for
a
sorcerer
no
one
is
bound
to
be
a
sorcerer
but
when
a
man
is
one
he
ought
not
to
shirk
the
duties
of
his
position
one
or
two
exceptions
might
be
found
to
this
almost
universal
antipathy
sieur
landoys
of
the
was
clerk
and
registrar
of
peter
port
custodian
of
the
documents
and
keeper
of
the
register
of
births
marriages
and
deaths
this
landoys
was
vain
of
his
descent
from
peter
landoys
treasurer
of
the
province
of
brittany
who
was
hanged
in
one
day
when
sieur
landoys
was
bathing
in
the
sea
he
ventured
to
swim
out
too
far
and
was
on
the
point
of
drowning
gilliatt
plunged
into
the
water
narrowly
escaping
drowning
himself
and
succeeded
in
saving
him
from
that
day
landoys
never
spoke
an
evil
word
of
gilliatt
to
those
who
expressed
surprise
at
this
change
he
replied
why
should
i
detest
a
man
who
never
did
me
any
harm
and
who
has
rendered
me
a
service
the
parish
clerk
and
registrar
even
came
at
last
to
feel
a
sort
of
friendship
for
gilliatt
this
public
functionary
was
a
man
without
prejudices
he
had
no
faith
in
sorcerers
he
laughed
at
people
who
went
in
fear
of
ghostly
visitors
as
for
him
he
had
a
boat
in
which
he
amused
himself
by
making
fishing
excursions
in
his
leisure
hours
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
extraordinary
unless
it
was
on
one
occasion
a
woman
clothed
in
white
who
rose
about
the
waters
in
the
light
of
the
moon
and
even
of
this
circumstance
he
was
not
quite
sure
moutonne
gahy
the
old
witch
of
torteval
had
given
him
a
little
bag
to
be
worn
under
the
cravat
as
a
protection
against
evil
spirits
he
ridiculed
the
bag
and
knew
not
what
it
contained
though
to
be
sure
he
carried
it
about
him
feeling
more
security
with
this
charm
hanging
on
his
neck
some
courageous
persons
emboldened
by
the
example
of
landoys
ventured
to
cite
in
gilliatt
favour
certain
extenuating
circumstances
a
few
signs
of
good
qualities
as
his
sobriety
his
abstinence
from
spirits
and
tobacco
and
sometimes
they
went
so
far
as
to
pass
this
elegant
eulogium
upon
him
he
neither
smokes
drinks
chews
tobacco
or
takes
snuff
sobriety
however
can
only
count
as
a
virtue
when
there
are
other
virtues
to
support
it
the
ban
of
public
opinion
lay
heavily
upon
gilliatt
in
any
case
as
a
marcou
gilliatt
had
it
in
his
power
to
render
great
services
on
a
certain
good
friday
at
midnight
a
day
and
an
hour
propitious
to
this
kind
of
cure
all
the
scrofulous
people
of
the
island
either
by
sudden
inspiration
or
by
concerted
action
presented
themselves
in
a
crowd
at
the
bû
de
la
rue
and
with
pitiable
sores
and
imploring
gestures
called
on
gilliatt
to
make
them
clean
but
he
refused
and
herein
the
people
found
another
proof
of
his
malevolence
vi
the
dutch
sloop
such
was
the
character
of
gilliatt
the
young
women
considered
him
ugly
ugly
he
was
not
he
might
perhaps
have
been
called
handsome
there
was
something
in
his
profile
of
rude
but
antique
grace
in
repose
it
had
some
resemblance
to
that
of
a
sculptured
dacian
on
the
trajan
column
his
ears
were
small
delicate
without
lobes
and
of
an
admirable
form
for
hearing
between
his
eyes
he
had
that
proud
vertical
line
which
indicates
in
a
man
boldness
and
perseverance
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
depressed
giving
a
slight
expression
of
bitterness
his
forehead
had
a
calm
and
noble
roundness
the
clear
pupils
of
his
eyes
possessed
a
steadfast
look
although
troubled
a
little
with
that
involuntary
movement
of
the
eyelids
which
fishermen
contract
from
the
glitter
of
the
waves
his
laugh
was
boyish
and
pleasing
no
ivory
could
be
of
a
finer
white
than
his
teeth
but
exposure
to
the
sun
had
made
him
swarthy
as
a
moor
the
ocean
the
tempest
and
the
darkness
can
not
be
braved
with
impunity
at
thirty
he
looked
already
like
a
man
of
he
wore
the
sombre
mask
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
the
people
had
nicknamed
him
malicious
gilliatt
there
is
an
indian
fable
to
the
effect
that
one
day
the
god
brahma
inquired
of
the
spirit
of
power
who
is
stronger
than
thee
and
the
spirit
replied
cunning
a
chinese
proverb
says
what
could
not
the
lion
do
if
he
was
the
monkey
also
gilliatt
was
neither
the
lion
nor
the
monkey
but
his
actions
gave
some
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
chinese
proverb
and
of
the
hindoo
fable
although
only
of
ordinary
height
and
strength
he
was
enabled
so
inventive
and
powerful
was
his
dexterity
to
lift
burdens
that
might
have
taxed
a
giant
and
to
accomplish
feats
which
would
have
done
credit
to
an
athlete
he
had
in
him
something
of
the
power
of
the
gymnast
he
used
with
equal
address
his
left
hand
and
his
right
he
never
carried
a
gun
but
was
often
seen
with
his
net
he
spared
the
birds
but
not
the
fish
to
these
dumb
creatures
he
was
an
excellent
swimmer
solitude
either
develops
the
mental
powers
or
renders
men
dull
and
vicious
gilliatt
sometimes
presented
himself
under
both
these
aspects
at
times
when
his
features
wore
that
air
of
strange
surprise
already
mentioned
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
man
of
mental
powers
scarcely
superior
to
the
savage
at
other
moments
an
indescribable
air
of
penetration
lighted
up
his
face
ancient
chaldea
possessed
some
men
of
this
stamp
at
certain
times
the
dullness
of
the
shepherd
mind
became
transparent
and
revealed
the
inspired
sage
after
all
he
was
but
a
poor
man
uninstructed
save
to
the
extent
of
reading
and
writing
it
is
probable
that
the
condition
of
his
mind
was
at
that
limit
which
separates
the
dreamer
from
the
thinker
the
thinker
wills
the
dreamer
is
a
passive
instrument
solitude
sinks
deeply
into
pure
natures
and
modifies
them
in
a
certain
degree
they
become
unconsciously
penetrated
with
a
kind
of
sacred
awe
the
shadow
in
which
the
mind
of
gilliatt
constantly
dwelt
was
composed
in
almost
equal
degrees
of
two
elements
both
obscure
but
very
different
within
himself
all
was
ignorance
and
weakness
without
infinity
and
mysterious
power
by
dint
of
frequent
climbing
on
the
rocks
of
escalading
the
rugged
cliffs
of
going
to
and
fro
among
the
islands
in
all
weathers
of
navigating
any
sort
of
craft
which
came
to
hand
of
venturing
night
and
day
in
difficult
channels
he
had
become
without
taking
count
of
his
other
advantages
and
merely
in
following
his
fancy
and
pleasure
a
seaman
of
extraordinary
skill
he
was
a
born
pilot
the
true
pilot
is
the
man
who
navigates
the
bed
of
the
ocean
even
more
than
its
surface
the
waves
of
the
sea
are
an
external
problem
continually
modified
by
the
submarine
conditions
of
the
waters
in
which
the
vessel
is
making
her
way
to
see
gilliatt
guiding
his
craft
among
the
reefs
and
shallows
of
the
norman
archipelago
one
might
have
fancied
that
he
carried
in
his
head
a
plan
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
he
was
familiar
with
it
all
and
feared
nothing
he
was
better
acquainted
with
the
buoys
in
the
channels
than
the
cormorants
who
make
them
their
the
almost
imperceptible
differences
which
distinguish
the
four
upright
buoys
of
the
creux
alligande
the
trémies
and
the
sardrette
were
perfectly
visible
and
clear
to
him
even
in
misty
weather
he
hesitated
neither
at
the
oval
buoy
of
anfré
nor
at
the
triple
iron
point
of
the
rousse
nor
at
the
white
ball
of
the
corbette
nor
at
the
black
ball
of
longue
pierre
and
there
was
no
fear
of
his
confounding
the
cross
of
goubeau
with
the
sword
planted
in
earth
at
la
platte
nor
the
buoy
of
the
barbées
with
the
buoy
of
the
moulinet
his
rare
skill
in
seamanship
showed
itself
in
a
striking
manner
one
day
at
guernsey
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
those
sea
tournaments
which
are
called
regattas
the
feat
to
be
performed
was
to
navigate
alone
a
boat
with
four
sails
from
sampson
to
the
isle
of
herm
at
one
league
distance
and
to
bring
the
boat
back
from
herm
to
sampson
to
manage
without
assistance
a
boat
with
four
sails
is
a
feat
which
every
fisherman
is
equal
to
and
the
difficulty
seemed
little
but
there
was
a
condition
which
rendered
it
far
from
simple
the
boat
to
begin
with
was
one
of
those
large
and
heavy
sloops
of
bygone
times
which
the
sailors
of
the
last
century
knew
by
the
name
of
dutch
belly
boats
this
ancient
style
of
flat
craft
carrying
on
the
larboard
and
starboard
sides
in
compensation
for
the
want
of
a
keel
two
wings
which
lowered
themselves
sometimes
the
one
sometimes
the
other
according
to
the
wind
may
occasionally
be
met
with
still
at
sea
in
the
second
place
there
was
the
return
from
herm
a
journey
which
was
rendered
more
difficult
by
a
heavy
ballasting
of
stones
the
conditions
were
to
go
empty
but
to
return
loaded
the
sloop
was
the
prize
of
the
contest
it
was
dedicated
beforehand
to
the
winner
this
dutch
belly
boat
had
been
employed
as
a
the
pilot
who
had
rigged
and
worked
it
for
twenty
years
was
the
most
robust
of
all
the
sailors
of
the
channel
when
he
died
no
one
had
been
found
capable
of
managing
the
sloop
and
it
was
in
consequence
determined
to
make
it
the
prize
of
the
regatta
the
sloop
though
not
decked
had
some
sea
qualities
and
was
a
tempting
prize
for
a
skilful
sailor
her
mast
was
somewhat
forward
which
increased
the
of
her
sails
besides
having
the
advantage
of
not
being
in
the
way
of
her
pilot
it
was
a
vessel
heavy
but
roomy
and
taking
the
open
sea
well
in
fact
a
good
serviceable
craft
there
was
eager
anxiety
for
the
prize
the
task
was
a
rough
one
but
the
reward
of
success
was
worth
having
seven
or
eight
fishermen
among
the
most
vigorous
of
the
island
presented
themselves
one
by
one
they
essayed
but
not
one
could
succeed
in
reaching
herm
the
last
one
who
tried
his
skill
was
known
for
having
crossed
in
a
the
terrible
narrow
sea
between
sark
and
sweating
with
his
exertions
he
brought
back
the
sloop
and
said
it
is
impossible
gilliatt
then
entered
the
bark
seized
first
of
all
the
oar
then
the
mainsail
and
pushed
out
to
sea
then
without
either
making
fast
the
boom
which
would
have
been
imprudent
or
letting
it
go
which
kept
the
sail
under
his
direction
and
leaving
the
boom
to
move
with
the
wind
without
drifting
he
held
the
tiller
with
his
left
hand
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
was
at
herm
three
hours
later
although
a
strong
breeze
had
sprung
up
and
was
blowing
across
the
roads
the
sloop
guided
by
gilliatt
returned
to
sampson
with
its
load
of
stones
he
had
with
an
extravagant
display
of
his
resources
even
added
to
the
cargo
the
little
bronze
cannon
at
herm
which
the
people
were
in
the
habit
of
firing
off
on
the
of
november
by
way
of
rejoicing
over
the
death
of
guy
fawkes
guy
fawkes
by
the
way
has
been
dead
two
hundred
and
sixty
years
a
remarkably
long
period
of
rejoicing
gilliatt
thus
burdened
and
encumbered
although
he
had
the
guy
cannon
in
the
boat
and
the
south
wind
in
his
sails
steered
or
rather
brought
back
the
heavy
craft
to
sampson
seeing
which
mess
lethierry
exclaimed
there
a
bold
sailor
for
you
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
gilliatt
we
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
again
of
mess
lethierry
the
sloop
was
awarded
to
gilliatt
this
adventure
detracted
nothing
from
his
evil
reputation
several
persons
declared
that
the
feat
was
not
at
all
astonishing
for
that
gilliatt
had
concealed
in
the
boat
a
branch
of
wild
medlar
but
this
could
not
be
proved
from
that
day
forward
gilliatt
navigated
no
boat
except
the
old
sloop
in
this
heavy
craft
he
went
on
his
fishing
avocation
he
kept
it
at
anchor
in
the
excellent
little
shelter
which
he
had
all
to
himself
under
the
very
wall
of
his
house
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
at
nightfall
he
cast
his
nets
over
his
shoulder
traversed
his
little
garden
climbed
over
the
parapet
of
dry
stones
stepped
lightly
from
rock
to
rock
and
jumping
into
the
sloop
pushed
out
to
sea
he
brought
home
heavy
takes
of
fish
but
people
said
that
his
medlar
branch
was
always
hanging
up
in
the
boat
no
one
had
ever
seen
this
branch
but
every
one
believed
in
its
existence
when
he
had
more
fish
than
he
wanted
he
did
not
sell
it
but
gave
it
away
the
poor
people
took
his
gift
but
were
little
grateful
for
they
knew
the
secret
of
his
medlar
branch
such
devices
can
not
be
permitted
it
is
unlawful
to
trick
the
sea
out
of
its
treasures
he
was
a
fisherman
but
he
was
something
more
he
had
by
instinct
or
for
amusement
acquired
a
knowledge
of
three
or
four
trades
he
was
a
carpenter
worker
in
iron
wheelwright
and
to
some
extent
an
engineer
no
one
could
mend
a
broken
wheel
better
than
he
could
he
manufactured
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
all
the
things
which
fishermen
use
in
a
corner
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
he
had
a
small
forge
and
an
anvil
and
the
sloop
having
but
one
anchor
he
had
succeeded
without
help
in
making
another
the
anchor
was
excellent
the
ring
had
the
necessary
strength
and
gilliatt
though
entirely
uninstructed
in
this
branch
of
the
smith
art
had
found
the
exact
dimensions
of
the
stock
for
preventing
the
of
the
fluke
ends
he
had
patiently
replaced
all
the
nails
in
the
planks
by
rivets
which
rendered
rust
in
the
holes
impossible
in
this
way
he
had
much
improved
the
qualities
of
the
sloop
he
employed
it
sometimes
when
he
took
a
fancy
to
spend
a
month
or
two
in
some
solitary
islet
like
chousey
or
the
casquets
people
said
ay
ay
gilliatt
is
away
but
this
was
a
circumstance
which
nobody
regretted
vii
a
fit
tenant
for
a
haunted
house
gilliatt
was
a
man
of
dreams
hence
his
daring
hence
also
his
timidity
he
had
ideas
on
many
things
which
were
peculiarly
his
own
there
was
in
his
character
perhaps
something
of
the
visionary
and
the
transcendentalist
hallucinations
may
haunt
the
poor
peasant
like
martin
no
less
than
the
king
like
henry
iv
there
are
times
when
the
unknown
reveals
itself
in
a
mysterious
way
to
the
spirit
of
man
a
sudden
rent
in
the
veil
of
darkness
will
make
manifest
things
hitherto
unseen
and
then
close
again
upon
the
mysteries
within
such
visions
have
occasionally
the
power
to
effect
a
transfiguration
in
those
whom
they
visit
they
convert
a
poor
into
a
mahomet
a
peasant
girl
tending
her
goats
into
a
joan
of
arc
solitude
generates
a
certain
amount
of
sublime
exaltation
it
is
like
the
smoke
arising
from
the
burning
bush
a
mysterious
lucidity
of
mind
results
which
converts
the
student
into
a
seer
and
the
poet
into
a
prophet
herein
we
find
a
key
to
the
mysteries
of
horeb
kedron
ombos
to
the
intoxication
of
castilian
laurels
the
revelations
of
the
month
busion
hence

more
frequently
this
visionary
state
overwhelms
and
stupefies
its
victim
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
divine
besottedness
the
hindoo
fakir
bears
about
with
him
the
burden
of
his
vision
as
the
cretin
his
goître
luther
holding
converse
with
devils
in
his
garret
at
wittenburg
pascal
shutting
out
the
view
of
the
infernal
regions
with
the
screen
of
his
cabinet
the
african
obi
conversing
with
the
god
bossum
are
each
and
all
the
same
phenomenon
diversely
interpreted
by
the
minds
in
which
they
manifest
themselves
according
to
their
capacity
and
power
luther
and
pascal
were
grand
and
are
grand
still
the
obi
is
simply
a
poor
creature
gilliatt
was
neither
so
exalted
nor
so
low
he
was
a
dreamer
nothing
more
nature
presented
itself
to
him
under
a
somewhat
strange
aspect
just
as
he
had
often
found
in
the
perfectly
limpid
water
of
the
sea
strange
creatures
of
considerable
size
and
of
various
shapes
of
the
medusa
genus
which
out
of
the
water
bore
a
resemblance
to
soft
crystal
and
which
cast
again
into
the
sea
became
lost
to
sight
in
that
medium
by
reason
of
their
identity
in
transparency
and
colour
so
he
imagined
that
other
transparencies
similar
to
these
almost
invisible
denizens
of
the
ocean
might
probably
inhabit
the
air
around
us
the
birds
are
scarcely
inhabitants
of
the
air
but
rather
amphibious
creatures
passing
much
of
their
lives
upon
the
earth
gilliatt
could
not
believe
the
air
a
mere
desert
he
used
to
say
since
the
water
is
filled
with
life
why
not
the
atmosphere
creatures
colourless
and
transparent
like
the
air
would
escape
from
our
observation
what
proof
have
we
that
there
are
no
such
creatures
analogy
indicates
that
the
liquid
fields
of
air
must
have
their
swimming
habitants
even
as
the
waters
of
the
deep
these
aerial
fish
would
of
course
be
diaphanous
a
provision
of
their
wise
creator
for
our
sakes
as
well
as
their
own
allowing
the
light
to
pass
through
their
forms
casting
no
shadow
having
no
defined
outline
they
would
necessarily
remain
unknown
to
us
and
beyond
the
grasp
of
human
sense
gilliatt
indulged
the
wild
fancy
that
if
it
were
possible
to
exhaust
the
earth
of
its
atmosphere
or
if
we
could
fish
the
air
as
we
fish
the
depths
of
the
sea
we
should
discover
the
existence
of
a
multitude
of
strange
animals
and
then
he
would
add
in
his
reverie
many
things
would
be
made
clear
reverie
which
is
thought
in
its
nebulous
state
borders
closely
upon
the
land
of
sleep
by
which
it
is
bounded
as
by
a
natural
frontier
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
in
the
form
of
an
atmosphere
filled
with
transparent
creatures
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
knowledge
of
the
vast
unknown
but
beyond
opens
up
the
illimitable
domain
of
the
possible
teeming
with
yet
other
beings
and
characterised
by
other
phenomena
all
this
would
be
nothing
supernatural
but
merely
the
occult
continuation
of
the
infinite
variety
of
creation
in
the
midst
of
that
laborious
idleness
which
was
the
chief
feature
in
his
existence
gilliatt
was
singularly
observant
he
even
carried
his
observations
into
the
domain
of
sleep
sleep
has
a
close
relation
with
the
possible
which
we
call
also
the
the
world
of
sleep
has
an
existence
of
its
own
regarded
as
a
separate
sphere
of
creation
is
a
universe
in
itself
the
material
nature
of
man
upon
which
philosophers
tell
us
that
a
column
of
air
miles
in
height
continually
presses
is
wearied
out
at
night
sinks
into
lassitude
lies
down
and
finds
repose
the
eyes
of
the
flesh
are
closed
but
in
that
drooping
head
less
inactive
than
is
supposed
other
eyes
are
opened
the
unknown
reveals
itself
the
shadowy
existences
of
the
invisible
world
become
more
akin
to
man
whether
it
be
that
there
is
a
real
communication
or
whether
things
far
off
in
the
unfathomable
abyss
are
mysteriously
brought
nearer
it
seems
as
if
the
impalpable
creatures
inhabiting
space
come
then
to
contemplate
our
natures
curious
to
comprehend
the
denizens
of
the
earth
some
phantom
creation
ascends
or
descends
to
walk
beside
us
in
the
dim
twilight
some
existence
altogether
different
from
our
own
composed
partly
of
human
consciousness
partly
of
something
else
quits
his
fellows
and
returns
again
after
presenting
himself
for
a
moment
to
our
inward
sight
and
the
sleeper
not
wholly
slumbering
nor
yet
entirely
conscious
beholds
around
him
strange
manifestations
of
life
pale
spectres
terrible
or
smiling
dismal
phantoms
uncouth
masks
unknown
faces
monsters
undefined
shapes
reflections
of
moonlight
where
there
is
no
moon
vague
fragments
of
monstrous
forms
all
these
things
which
come
and
go
in
the
troubled
atmosphere
of
sleep
and
to
which
men
give
the
name
of
dreams
are
in
truth
only
realities
invisible
to
those
who
walk
about
the
daylight
world

is

at

the
seat
the
curious
visitor
in
these
days
would
seek
in
vain
in
the
little
bay
of
houmet
for
the
house
in
which
gilliatt
lived
or
for
his
garden
or
the
creek
in
which
he
sheltered
the
dutch
sloop
the
bû
de
la
rue
no
longer
exists
even
the
little
peninsula
on
which
his
house
stood
has
vanished
levelled
by
the
pickaxe
of
the
quarryman
and
carried
away
by
by
dealers
in
rock
and
granite
it
must
be
sought
now
in
the
churches
the
palaces
and
the
quays
of
a
great
city
all
that
ridge
of
rocks
has
been
long
ago
conveyed
to
london
these
long
lines
of
broken
cliffs
in
the
sea
with
their
frequent
gaps
and
crevices
are
like
miniature
chains
of
mountains
they
strike
the
eye
with
the
impression
which
a
giant
may
be
supposed
to
have
in
contemplating
the
cordilleras
in
the
language
of
the
country
they
are
called
banques
these
banques
vary
considerably
in
form
some
resemble
a
long
spine
of
which
each
rock
forms
one
of
the
vertebræ
others
are
like
the
backbone
of
a
fish
while
some
bear
an
odd
resemblance
to
a
crocodile
in
the
act
of
drinking
at
the
extremity
of
the
ridge
on
which
the
bû
de
la
rue
was
situate
was
a
large
rock
which
the
fishing
people
of
houmet
called
the
horn
this
rock
a
sort
of
pyramid
resembled
though
less
in
height
the
pinnacle
of
jersey
at
high
water
the
sea
divided
it
from
the
ridge
and
the
horn
stood
alone
at
low
water
it
was
approached
by
an
isthmus
of
rocks
the
remarkable
feature
of
this
beast
horn
was
a
sort
of
natural
seat
on
the
side
next
the
sea
hollowed
out
by
the
water
and
polished
by
the
rains
the
seat
however
was
a
treacherous
one
the
stranger
was
insensibly
attracted
to
it
by
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
as
the
guernsey
folks
said
something
detained
him
there
in
spite
of
himself
for
there
is
a
charm
in
a
wide
view
the
seat
seemed
to
offer
itself
for
his
convenience
it
formed

had
the

hollowed
out
by

supports
two
rocky

seemed
made
expressly
for
him

he
looked
up

admired
without

could
be

it
sank
in

was

looked
around

beating
of
its
dusky
wings
like
this
strange

the
wind
wanders
about
alternately
ravaging
or
lulling
into
security
so
the
stranger
would
continue
contemplating
the

listening
for
a
movement
in
the

and
yielding
himself
up
to
dreamy
indolence

in

kept
a
character
for

however
he
was
simply
a
sailor
the

was
his
element

used
to
say
that

his

two

three

he
said

had
navigated
the
great
oceans
both
of

he
preferred
the
channel
he
used
to
exclaim
enthusiastically
that

the

for
a
rough
time
of
it
he
was
born
at

and
at

would
have
preferred
to
end
his
days
after
sailing
several
times
round

seeing

returned

lethierry
was
a
guernsey
man
that
peculiar
amalgamation
of
frenchman

norman

rather
english
he
had
within
himself
this
quadruple
extraction
merged
and
almost
lost
in
that
far
wider
country
the
ocean
throughout
his
life
and
wheresoever
he
went
he
had
preserved
the
habits
of
a
norman
fisherman
all
this
however
did
not
prevent
his
looking
now
and
then
into
some
old
book
of
taking
pleasure
in
reading
in
knowing
the
names
of
philosophers
and
poets

in

little

mess
lethierry
was
the

lethierry
uncultivated
nature
however
was
not
without
certain
refinements
he
was
fastidious
upon
the
subject
of
women
hands
in
his
early
years
while
still
a
lad
passing
from
the
stage
of
to
that
of
sailor
he
had
heard
the
admiral

say
there
goes

pretty
girl
but
what
horrible
great

an
observation
from
an
admiral
on
any
subject
is
a
command
a
law
an
authority
far
above
that
of
an
oracle
the
exclamation
of
admiral
de
suffren
had
rendered
lethierry
fastidious
and
exacting
in
the
matter
of
small
and
white
hands
his
own
hand
a
large
club
fist
of
the
colour
of
mahogany
was
like
a
mallet
or
a
pair
of
pincers
for
a
friendly
grasp
and
tightly
closed

almost
break
a
he
had
never
married
he
had
either
no
inclination
for
matrimony
or
had
never
found
a
suitable
match
that
perhaps
was
due
to
his
being
a
stickler
for
hands
like
those
of
a
duchess
such
hands
are
indeed
somewhat
rare
among
the
fishermen
daughters
at
portbail
it
was
whispered
however
that
at
rochefort
on
the
charente
he
had
once
upon
a
time
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
certain
grisette
realising
his
ideal
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
graceful
hands
but
she
was
a
vixen
and
had
also
a
habit
of
scratching
woe
betide
any
one
who
attacked
her
yet
her
nails
though
capable
at
a
pinch
of
being
turned
into
claws
were
of
a
cleanliness
which
left
nothing
to
be
desired
it
was
these
peculiarly
bewitching
nails
which
had
first
enchanted
and
then
disturbed
the
peace
of
lethierry
who
fearing
that
he
might
one
day
become
no
longer
master
of
his
mistress
had
decided
not
to
conduct
that
young
lady
to
the
nuptial
altar
another
time
he
met
at
aurigny
a
country
girl
who
pleased
him
he
thought
of
marriage
when
one
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
said
to
him
i
congratulate
you
you
will
have
for
your
wife
a
good
fuel
maker
lethierry
asked
the
meaning
of
this
it
appeared
that
the
country
people
at
aurigny
have
a
certain
custom
of
collecting
manure
from
their
which
they
throw
against
a
wall
where
it
is
left
to
dry
and
fall
to
the
ground
cakes
of
dried
manure
of
this
kind
are
used
for
fuel

are
called

no

of
getting
a

if
she
is
not
a
good

maker
but
the
young

talent
only
inspired
disgust
in
lethierry
besides
he
had
in
his
love
matters
a
kind
of
rough
country
philosophy
a
sort
of
habit
of
mind
always
smitten
but
never
enslaved
he
boasted
of
having
been
in
his
youth
easily
conquered
by
a
petticoat
or
rather
a
for
what
is
called
a
crinoline
was
in
his
time
called
a
a
term
which
in
his
use
of
it
signifies
both
something
more
and
something
less

a

was
said
what
he
planned
out
was
done
he
bent
neither
before
an
objection
nor
before
the
tempest
the
word
no
had
no
existence
for
him
whether
it
was
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
or
in
the
angry
muttering
of
a
in
the
teeth
of
all

on
in

way
he
would
take
no

hence
his
obstinacy
in

and
his
intrepidity
on
the
ocean
he
seasoned
his
simple
meal
of
fish
soup
for
himself
knowing
the
quantities
of
pepper

herbs
which

required
and

as
well

as
with

to
complete
the
sketch
of
lethierry
peculiarities
the
reader
must
conjure
a
being
to
whom
the
putting
on
of
a
surtout
would
amount
to
a
transfiguration
whom
a
landsman
greatcoat
would
convert
into
a
strange
animal
one
who
standing
with
his
locks
blown
about
by
the
wind
might
have
represented
old
jean
bart
but
who
in
the
landsman
round
hat
would
have
looked
an
idiot
awkward
in
cities
wild
and
redoubtable
at
sea
a
man
with
broad
shoulders
fit
for
a
porter
one
who
indulged
in
no
oaths
was
rarely
in
anger
whose
voice
had
a
soft
accent
which
became
like
thunder
in
a
a
peasant
who
had
read
something
of
the
philosophy
of
diderot
and
a
guernsey
man
who
had
seen
the
great
revolution
a
learned
ignoramus
free
from
bigotry
but
indulging
in
visions
with
more
faith
in
the
white
lady
than
in
the
holy
virgin
possessing
the
strength
of
polyphemus
the
perseverance
of
columbus
with
a
little
of
the
bull
in
his
nature
and
a
little
of
the
child
add
to
these
physical
and
mental
peculiarities
a
somewhat
flat
nose
large
cheeks
a
set
of
teeth
still
perfect
a
face
filled
with
wrinkles
and
which
seemed
to
have
been
buffeted
by
the
waves
and
subjected
to
the
beating
of
the
winds
of
forty
years
a
brow
in
which
the
storm
and
tempest
were
plainly
written
an
incarnation
of
a
rock
in
the
open
sea
add
to
this
too
a
smile
always
ready
to
light
up
his
countenance
and
you
have
before
you
mess
lethierry
mess
lethierry
had
two
special
objects
of
affection
only
their
names
were

déruchette
book
iii
durande
and
déruchette
i
prattle
and
smoke
the
human
body
might
well
be
regarded
as
a
mere
simulacrum
but
it
envelopes
our
reality
it
darkens
our
light
and
broadens
the
shadow
in
which
we
live
the
soul
is
the
reality
of
our
existence
strictly
speaking
the
human
visage
is
a
mask
the
true
man
is
that
which
exists
under
what
is
called
man
if
that
being
which
thus
exists
sheltered
and
secreted
behind
that
illusion
which
we
call
the
flesh
could
be
approached
more
than
one
strange
revelation
would
be
made
the
vulgar
error
is
to
mistake
the
outward
husk
for
the
living
spirit
yonder
maiden
for
example
if
we
could
see
her
as
she
really
is
might
she
not
figure
as
some
bird
of
the
air
a
bird
transmuted
into
a
young
maiden
what
could
be
more
exquisite
picture
it
in
your
own
home
and
call
it
déruchette
delicious
creature
one
might
be
almost
tempted
to
say
mademoiselle
goldfinch
the
wings
are
invisible
but
the
chirping
may
still
be
heard
sometimes
too
she
pipes
a
clear
loud
song
in
her
childlike
prattle
the
creature
is
perhaps
inferior
but
in
her
song
how
superior
to
humanity
when
womanhood
dawns
this
angel
flies
away
but
sometimes
returns
bringing
back
a
little
one
to
a
mother
meanwhile
she
who
is
one
day
to
be
a
mother
is
for
a
long
while
a
child
the
girl
becomes
a
maiden
fresh
and
joyous
as
the
lark
noting
her
movements
we
feel
as
if
it
was
good
of
her
not
to
fly
away
the
dear
familiar
companion
moves
at
her
own
sweet
will
about
the
house
flits
from
branch
to
branch
or
rather
from
room
to
room
goes
to
and
fro
approaches
and
retires
plumes
her
wings
or
rather
combs
her
hair
and
makes
all
kinds
of
gentle
noises
murmurings
of
unspeakable
delight
to
certain
ears
she
asks
a
question
and
is
answered
is
asked
something
in
return
and
chirps
a
reply
it
is
delightful
to
chat
with
her
when
tired
of
serious
talk
for
this
creature
carries
with
her
something
of
her
skyey
element
she
is
as
it
were
a
thread
of
gold
interwoven
with
your
sombre
thoughts
you
feel
almost
grateful
to
her
for
her
kindness
in
not
making
herself
invisible
when
it
would
be
so
easy
for
her
to
be
even
impalpable
for
the
beautiful
is
a
necessary
of
life
there
is
in
this
world
no
function
more
important
than
that
of
being
charming
the
would
be
incomplete
without
the
to
shed
joy
around
to
radiate
happiness
to
cast
light
upon
dark
days
to
be
the
golden
thread
of
our
destiny
and
the
very
spirit
of
grace
and
harmony
is
not
this
to
render
a
service
does
not
beauty
confer
a
benefit
upon
us
even
by
the
simple
fact
of
being
beautiful
here
and
there
we
meet
with
one
who
possesses
that
power
of
enchanting
all
about
her
sometimes
she
is
ignorant
herself
of
this
magical
influence
which
is
however
for
that
reason
only
the
more
perfect
her
presence
lights
up
the
home
her
approach
is
like
a
cheerful
warmth
she
passes
by
and
we
are
content
she
stays
awhile
and
we
are
happy
to
behold
her
is
to
live
she
is
the
aurora
with
a
human
face
she
has
no
need
to
do
more
than
simply
to
be
she
makes
an
eden
of
the
house
paradise
breathes
from
her
and
she
communicates
this
delight
to
all
without
taking
any
greater
trouble
than
that
of
existing
beside
them
is
it
not
a
thing
divine
to
have
a
smile
which
none
know
how
has
the
power
to
lighten
the
weight
of
that
enormous
chain
which
all
the
living
in
common
drag
behind
them
déruchette
possessed
this
smile
we
may
even
say
that
this
smile
was
déruchette
herself
there
is
one
thing
which
has
more
resemblance
to
ourselves
than
even
our
face
and
that
is
our
expression
but
there
is
yet
another
thing
which
more
resembles
us
than
this
and
that
is
our
smile
déruchette
smiling
was
simply
déruchette
there
is
something
peculiarly
attractive
in
the
jersey
and
guernsey
race
the
women
particularly
the
young
are
remarkable
for
a
pure
and
exquisite
beauty
their
complexion
is
a
combination
of
the
saxon
fairness
with
the
proverbial
ruddiness
of
the
norman
people
rosy
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
but
the
eyes
want
brilliancy
the
english
training
dulls
them
their
liquid
glances
will
be
irresistible
whenever
the
secret
is
found
of
giving
them
that
depth
which
is
the
glory
of
the
parisienne
happily
englishwomen
are
not
yet
quite
transformed
into
the
parisian
type
déruchette
was
not
a
parisian
yet
she
was
certainly
not
a
guernesiaise
lethierry
had
brought
her
up
to
be
neat
and
delicate
and
pretty
and
so
she
was
déruchette
had
at
times
an
air
of
bewitching
langour
and
a
certain
mischief
in
the
eye
which
were
altogether
involuntary
she
scarcely
knew
perhaps
the
meaning
of
the
word
love
and
yet
not
unwillingly
ensnared
those
about
her
in
the
toils
but
all
this
in
her
was
innocent
she
never
thought
of
marrying
déruchette
had
the
prettiest
little
hands
in
the
world
and
little
feet
to
match
them
sweetness
and
goodness
reigned
throughout
her
person
her
family
and
fortune
were
her
uncle
mess
lethierry
her
occupation
was
only
to
live
her
daily
life
her
accomplishments
were
the
knowledge
of
a
few
songs
her
intellectual
gifts
were
summed
up
in
her
simple
innocence
she
had
the
graceful
repose
of
the
west
indian
woman
mingled
at
times
with
giddiness
and
vivacity
with
the
teasing
playfulness
of
a
child
yet
with
a
dash
of
melancholy
her
dress
was
somewhat
rustic
and
like
that
peculiar
to
her
country
elegant
though
not
in
accordance
with
the
fashions
of
great
cities
for
she
wore
flowers
in
her
bonnet
all
the
year
round
add
to
all
this
an
open
brow
a
neck
supple
and
graceful
chestnut
hair
a
fair
skin
slightly
freckled
with
exposure
to
the
sun
a
mouth
somewhat
large
but
and
visited
from
time
to
time
by
a
dangerous
smile
this
was
déruchette
sometimes
in
the
evening
a
little
after
sunset
at
the
moment
when
the
dusk
of
the
sky
mingles
with
the
dusk
of
the
sea
and
twilight
invests
the
waves
with
a
mysterious
awe
the
people
beheld
entering
the
harbour
of
sampson
upon
the
dark
rolling
waters
a
strange
undefined
thing
a
monstrous
form
which
puffed
and
blew
a
horrid
machine
which
roared
like
a
wild
beast
and
smoked
like
a
volcano
a
species
of
hydra
foaming
among
the
breakers
and
leaving
behind
it
a
dense
cloud
as
it
rushed
on
towards
the
town
with
a
frightful
beating
of
its
fins
and
a
throat
belching
forth
flame
this
was

the
old
story
of
utopia
a
steamboat
was
a
prodigious
novelty
in
the
waters
of
the
channel
in
the
whole
coast
of
normandy
was
long
strangely
excited
by
it
ten
or
a
dozen
steam
vessels
crossing
and
recrossing
within
the
bounds
of

horizon
scarcely
attract
a
glance
from
loiterers
on
the
shore
at
the
most
some
persons
whose
interest
or
business
it
is
to
note
such
things
will
observe
the
indications
in
their
smoke
of
whether
they
burn
welsh
or
newcastle

they
pass
and
that
is
all
welcome
if
coming
home
a
pleasant
passage
if
outward
bound
folks
were
less
calm
on
the
subject
of
these
wonderful
inventions
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
century
and
the
new
and
strange
machines
and
their
long
lines
of

regarded

the

islanders
in
that
puritanical
archipelago
where
the
queen
of
england
has
been
censured
for
violating
the
scriptures
by
using
chloroform
during
her
accouchments
the
first
which
made
its
appearance
received
the
name
of
the
devil
boat
in
the
eyes
of
these
worthy
fishermen
once
catholics
now
calvinists
but
always
bigots
it
seemed
to
be
a
portion
of
the
infernal
regions
which
had
been
somehow
set
afloat
a
local
preacher
selected
for
his
discourse
the
question
of
whether
man
has
the
right
to
make
fire
and
water
work
together
when
god
had
divided
them
this
beast
composed
of
iron
and
fire
did
it
not
resemble
leviathan
was
it
not
an
attempt
to
bring
chaos
again
into
the
universe
this
is
not
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
progress
of
civilisation
has
been
stigmatised
as
a
return
to
chaos
a
mad
notion
a
gross
delusion
an
absurdity
such
was
the
verdict
of
the
academy
of
sciences
when
consulted
by
napoleon
on
the
subject
of
steamboats
early
in
the
present
century
the
poor
fishermen
of
sampson
may
be
excused
for
not
being
in
scientific
matters
any
wiser
than
the
mathematicians
of
paris
and
in
religious
matters
a
little
island
like
guernsey
is
not
bound
to
be
more
enlightened
than
a
great
continent
like
america
in
the
year
when
the
first
steamboat
of
fulton
commanded
by
livingston
furnished
with
one
of
watt
engines
sent
from
england
and
manoeuvred
besides
her
ordinary
crew
by
two
frenchmen
only
andré
michaux
and
another
made
her
first
voyage
from
new
york
to
albany
it
happened
that
she
set
sail
on
the
of
august
the
methodists
took
up
this
important
fact
and
in
numberless
chapels
preachers
were
heard
calling
down
a
malediction
on
the
machine
and
declaring
that
this
number
was
no
other
than
the
total
of
the
ten
horns
and
seven
heads
of
the
beast
of
the
apocalypse
in
america
they
invoked
against
the
steamboats
the
beast
from
the
book
of
revelation
in
europe
the
reptile
of
the
book
of
genesis
this
was
the
simple
difference
the
savants
had
rejected
steamboats
as
impossible
the
priests
had
anathematised
them
as
impious
science
had
condemned
and
religion
consigned
them
to
perdition
fulton
was
a
new
incarnation
of
lucifer
the
simple
people
on
the
coasts
and
in
the
villages
were
confirmed
in
their
prejudice
by
the
uneasiness
which
they
felt
at
the
outlandish
sight
the
religious
view
of
steamboats
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
water
and
fire
were
divorced
at
the
creation
this
divorce
was
enjoined
by
god
himself
man
has
no
right
to
join
what
his
maker
has
put
asunder
to
reunite
what
he
has

look
of
this
thing

lethierry
perhaps
could
have
been
found
at
that
early
period
daring
enough
to
dream

an

rantaine
about
forty
years
before
the
period
of
the
commencement
of
our
narrative
there
stood
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
near
the
city
wall
between

a
house
of
doubtful
reputation
it
was
a
lonely
ruinous
building
evidently
a
place
for
dark
deeds
on

occasion
here

species
of

who
had
been

to

practising
at

figured
somewhat
later
at
the
assize
court
the
name
of
this
family
was
rantaine
on
a
mahogany
chest
of
drawers
in
the
old
house
were
two
china
cups
ornamented
with
flowers
on
one
of
which
appeared
in
gilt
letters
the
words
a
souvenir
of
friendship
on
the
other
a
token
of
esteem
the
child
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
vice
in
this
miserable
home
the
father
and
mother
having
belonged
to
the
lower
middle
class
the
boy
had
learnt
to
read
and
they
brought
it
up
in
a
fashion
the
mother
pale
and
almost
in
rags
gave
instruction
as
she
called
it
mechanically
to
the
little
one
heard
it
spell
a
few
words
to
her
and
interrupted
the
lesson
to
accompany
her
husband
on
some
criminal
expedition
or
to
earn
the
wages
of
prostitution
meanwhile
the
book
remained
open
on
the
table
as
she
had
left
it
and
the
boy
sat
beside
it
meditating
in
his
way
the
father
and
mother
detected
one
day
in
one
of
their
criminal
enterprises
suddenly
vanished
into
that
obscurity
in
which
the
penal
laws
envelop
convicted
malefactors
the
child
too
disappeared
lethierry
in
his
wanderings
about
the
world
stumbled
one
day
on
an
adventurer
like
himself
helped
him
out
of
some
scrape
rendered
him
a
kindly
service
and
was
apparently
repaid
with
gratitude
he
took
a
fancy
to
the
stranger
picked
him
up
and
brought
him
to
guernsey
where
finding
him
intelligent
in
learning
the
duties
of
a
sailor
aboard
a
coasting
vessel
he
made
him
a
companion
this
stranger
was
the
little
rantaine
now
grown
up
to
manhood
rantaine
like
lethierry
had
a
bull
neck
a
large
and
powerful
breadth
of
shoulders
for
carrying
burdens
and
loins
like
those
of
the
farnese
hercules
lethierry
and
he
had
a
remarkable
similarity
of
appearance
rantaine
was
the
taller
people
who
saw
their
forms
behind
as
they
were
walking
side
by
side
along
the
port
exclaimed
there
are
two
brothers
on
looking
them
in
the
face
the
effect
was
different
all
that
was
open
in
the
countenance
of
lethierry
was
reserved
and
cautious
in
that

call

hated

though
for
all
that
he
would
certainly
have
been
an
admirer
of

the
glow
of
his
royalist
enthusiasm
broke
forth
in
the
shape
of
a
huge
white
feather
in
his
cap
his
life
had
been
a

eclipses

in
the

and
had
learnt
turkish
by
dint
of

had
been
to

at

at

the
mosque
there
to
read
aloud
to
the
faithful
the
koran
inscribed
upon
slips
of
wood
or
pieces
of
camel
leather
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
was
a
renegade
he
was
capable
of
everything
and
something
worse
he
had
a
trick
of
laughing
loud
and
knitting
his
brows
at
the
same
time
he
used
to
say

his
manner
was
rather
cheerful
and
cordial
than
otherwise
the
expression
of
his

contradicted
the
sense
of
his

his
nostrils
had
an
odd
way
of
distending
themselves
in
the
corners
of
his

he
had
a
little
network
of

in
which
all
sorts
of
dark
thoughts
seemed
to
meet
together
it
was
here
alone
that
the
secret
of
his
physiognomy
could
be
thoroughly
studied
his
flat
foot
was
a
vulture
claw
his
skull
was
low
at
the

and
large
about
the

bristled

fine
day
in

rantaine
was
suddenly
missing
lethierry
partner
had
absconded
leaving
the
treasury
of
their
partnership
empty
in
this
treasury
there
was
some
money
of
rantaine
no
doubt
but
there
were
also
fifty
thousand
francs
belonging
to
lethierry
by
forty
years
of
industry
and
probity
as
a
coaster
and
ship
carpenter
lethierry
had
saved
one
hundred
thousand
francs
rantaine
robbed
him
of
half
the
sum
half
ruined
lethierry
did
not
lose
heart
but
began
at
once
to
think
how
to
repair
his
misfortune
a
stout
heart
may
be
ruined
in
fortune
but
not
in
spirit
it
was
just
about
that
time
that
people
began
to
talk
of
the
new
kind
of
boat
to
be
moved
by
lethierry
conceived
the
idea
of
trying
fulton
invention
so
much
disputed
about
and
by
one
of
these
to
connect
the
channel
islands
with
the
french
coast
he
staked
his
all
upon
this
idea
he
devoted
to
it
the
wreck
of
his
savings
accordingly
six
months
after
rantaine
flight
the
astonished
people
of
sampson
beheld
issuing
from
the
port
a
vessel
discharging
huge
volumes
of
smoke
and
looking
like
a
ship
at
sea
this
was
the
first
to
navigate
the
channel
this
vessel
to
which
the
people
in
their
dislike
and
contempt
for
novelty
immediately
gave
the
nickname
of
lethierry
galley
was
announced
as
intended
to
maintain
a
constant
communication
between
guernsey
and
malo
iv
continuation
of
the
story
of
utopia
it
may
be
well
imagined
that
the
new
enterprise
did
not
prosper
much
at
first
the
owners
of
cutters
passing
between
the
island
of
guernsey
and
the
french
coast
were
loud
in
their
outcries
they
denounced
this
attack
upon
the
holy
scriptures
and
their
monopoly
the
chapels
began
to
fulminate
against
it
one
reverend
gentleman
named
elihu
stigmatised
the
new
as
an
atheistical
construction
and
the
was
declared
the
only
orthodox
craft
the
people
saw
the
horns
of
the
devil
among
the
beasts
which
the
fireship
carried
to
and
fro
this
storm
of
protest
continued
a
considerable
time
at
last
however
it
began
to
be
perceived
that
these
animals
arrived
less
tired
and
sold
better
their
meat
being
superior
that
the
sea
risk
was
less
also
for
passengers
that
this
mode
of
travelling
was
less
expensive
shorter
and
more
sure
that
they
started
at
a
fixed
time
and
arrived
at
a
fixed
time
that
consignments
of
fish
travelling
faster
arrived
fresher
and
that
it
was
now
possible
to
find
a
sale
in
the
french
markets
for
the
surplus
of
great
takes
of
fish
so
common
in
guernsey
the
butter
too
from
the
guernsey
cows
made
the
passage
quicker
in
the
devil
boat
than
in
the
old
sailing
vessels
and
lost
nothing
of
its
good
quality
insomuch
that
dinan
in
brittany
began
to
become
a
customer
for
it
as
well
as
brieuc
and
rennes
in
short
thanks
to
what
they
called
lethierry
galley
the
people
enjoyed
safe
travelling
regular
communication
prompt
and
easy
passages
to
and
fro
an
increase
of
circulation
an
extension
of
markets
and
of
commerce
and
finally
it
was
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
patronise
this
devil
boat
which
flew
in
the
face
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
brought
wealth
to
the
island
some
daring
spirits
even
went
so
far
as
to
express
a
positive
satisfaction
at
it
sieur
landoys
the
registrar
bestowed
his
approval
upon
the
vessel
an
undoubted
piece
of
impartiality
on
his
part
as
he
did
not
like
lethierry
for
first
of
all
lethierry
was
entitled
to
the
dignity
of
mess
while
landoys
was
merely
sieur
landoys
then
although
registrar
of
peter
port
landoys
was
a
parishioner
of
sampson
now
there
was
not
in
the
entire
parish
another
man
besides
them
devoid
of
prejudices
it
seemed
little
enough
therefore
to
indulge
themselves
with
a
detestation
of
each
other
two
of
a
trade

the
proverb

agree
sieur
landoys
however
had
the
honesty
to
support
the
steamboat
others
followed
landoys
by
little
and
little
these
facts
multiplied
the
growth
of
opinion
is
like
the
rising
tide
time
and
the
continued
and
increasing
success
of
the
venture
with
the
evidence
of
real
service
rendered
and
the
improvement
in
the
general
welfare
gradually
converted
the
people
and
the
day
at
length
arrived
when
with
the
exception
of
a
few
wiseacres
every
one
admired
lethierry
galley
it
would
probably
win
less
admiration
this
steamboat
of
forty
years
since
would
doubtless
provoke
a
smile
among
our
modern
for
this
marvel
was
this
prodigy
was
clumsy
and
infirm
the
distance
between
our
grand
atlantic
of

floated
on

not

in

of

exactly
one
hundred
years
from
to
separate
the
first
of
papin
from
the
first
steamboat
of
fulton
galley
was
assuredly
a
great
improvement
upon
those
two
rough
sketches
but
it
was
itself
only
a
sketch
for
all
that
it
was
a
masterpiece
in
its
way
every
scientific
discovery
in
embryo
presents
that
double
aspect
a
monster
in
the
foetus
a
marvel
in
the
germ
v
the
devil
boat
lethierry
galley
was
not
masted
with
a
view
to
sailing
well
a
fact
which
was
not
a
defect
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
laws
of
naval
construction
besides
her
motive
power
being
steam
her
sails
were
only
accessory
a
paddle
steamboat
moreover
is
almost
insensible
to
sails
the
new
was
too
short
round
and
she
had
too
much
bow
and
too
great
a
breadth
of
quarter
the
daring
of
inventors
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
of
making
a
light
lethierry
boat
had
some
of
the
defects
of
gilliatt
dutch
sloop
she
pitched
very
little
but
she
rolled
a
good
deal
her
were
too
high
she
had
too
much
beam
for
her
length
the
massive
machinery
encumbered
her
and
to
make
her
capable
of
carrying
a
heavy
cargo
her
constructors
had
raised
her
bulwarks
to
an
unusual
height
giving
to
the
vessel
the
defects
of
old
a
bastard
model
which
would
have
to
be
cut
down
to
render
them
really
seaworthy
or
fit
to
go
into
action
being
short
she
ought
to
have
been
able
to
veer
quickly
the
time
employed
in
a
manoeuvre
of
that
kind
being
in
proportion
to
the
length
of
the
vessel
but
her
weight
deprived
her
of
the
advantage
of
her
shortness
her
was
too
broad
a
fact
which
retarded
her
the
resistance
of
the
sea
being
proportioned
to
the
largest
section
below
the
and
to
the
square
of
the
speed
her
prow
was
vertical
which
would
not
be
regarded
as
a
fault
at
the
present
day
but
at
that
period
this
portion
of
the
construction
was
invariably
sloped
at
an
angle
of
degrees
all
the
curving
lines
of
the
hull
agreed
well
together
but
it
was
not
long
enough
for
oblique
sailing
or
for
lying
parallel
with
the
water
displaced
which
should
always
be
thrown
off
laterally
in
rough
weather
she
drew
too
much
water
sometimes
fore
sometimes
aft
which
showed
that
her
centre
of
gravity
was
not
rightly
adjusted
owing
to
the
weight
of
the
engine
the
cargo
shifted
so
that
the
centre
of
gravity
was
often
aft
of
the
mainmast
and
then
steam
power
had
to
be
resorted
to
for
at
such
times
the
mainsail
had
to
be
furled
as
it
only
made
the
vessel
fall
off
if
close
to
the
wind
very
careful
manoeuvring
was
required
the
rudder
was
the
not
the
wheeled
one
of
the
present
time
two
skiffs
a
species
of
were
suspended
to
the
davits
the
vessel
had
four
anchors
the
the
second
or
working
anchor
and
two
these
four
anchors
slung
by
chains
were
moved
according
to
the
occasion
by
the
great
capstan
of
the
poop
or
by
the
small
capstan
at
the
prow
at
that
period
the
pump
windlass
had
not
superseded
the
intermitting
efforts
of
the
old
handspike
having
only
two
one
on
the
starboard
and
the
other
on
the
larboard
side
the
vessel
could
not
move
conveniently
in
certain
winds
though
she
could
aid
herself
at
such
times
with
the
second
anchor
her
buoys
were
normal
and
so
constructed
that
they
carried
the
weight
of
the
without
dipping
the
launch
was
of
a
useful
size
of
service
in
all
cases
of
need
and
able
to
raise
the
main
anchor
a
novelty
about
her
was
that
she
was
rigged
with
chains
which
in
no
way
detracted
however
from
the
mobility
of
the
running
rigging
or
from
the
firmness
of
the
standing
rigging
the
masts
yards
although
not
of
quality
were
not
in
any
way
amiss
and
the
rigging
at
the
was
not
very
noticeable
the
ribs
were
solid
but
coarse
less
delicacy
of
wood
being
required
for
steam
than
for
sail
her
speed
was
six
knots
an
hour
when
she
rode
well
take
her
as
she
was
lethierry
galley
was
a
good
sea
boat
but
people
felt
that
in
moments
of
danger
from
reefs
or
waterspouts
she
would
be
hardly
manageable
unhappily
her
build
made
her
roll
about
on
the
waves
with
a
perpetual
creaking
like
that
of
a
new
shoe
she
was
above
all
a
merchandise
boat
and
like
all
ships
built
more
for
commerce
than
for
fighting
was
constructed
exclusively
with
a
view
to
stowage
she
carried
few
passengers
the
transport
of
cattle
rendered
stowage
difficult
and
very
peculiar
vessels
carried
bullocks
at
that
time
in
the
hold
which
was
a
complication
of
the
difficulty
at
the
present
day
they
are
stowed
on
the

of
lethierry
devil
boat
were
painted
white
the
hull
down
to
the
red
and
all
the
rest
of
the
vessel
black
according
to
the
somewhat
ugly
fashion
of
this
century
when
empty
she
drew
seven
feet
of
water
and
when
laden
fourteen
with
regard
to
the
engine
it
was
of
considerable
power
to
speak
exactly
its
power
was
equal
to
that
of
one
horse
to
every
three
tons
burden
which
is
almost
equal
to
that
of
a
tugboat
the
paddles
were
well
placed
a
little
in
advance
of
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
vessel
the
maximum
pressure
of
the
engine
was
equal
to
two
atmospheres
it
consumed
a
great
deal
of
coal
although
it
was
constructed
on
the
condensation
and
expansion
principles
it
had
no
on
account
of
the
instability
of
the
point
of
support
but
this
was
then
as
now
compensated
for
by
two
cranks
at
the
extremities
of
the
revolving
shaft
so
arranged
that
one
was
always
at
right
angles
when
the
other
was
at
the
whole
rested
on
a
single
sheet
of
so
that
even
in
case
of
any
serious
damage
no
shock
of
the
waves
could
upset
its
equilibrium
and
even
if
the
hull
were
injured
the
engine
would
remain
intact
to
render
it
stronger
still
the
had
been
placed
near
the
so
that
the
centre
of
oscillation
of
the
was
transferred
from
the
middle
to
the
end
since
then
oscillating
cylinders
have
been
invented
which
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
but
in
those
days
the
placing
of
the
near
the
cylinder
was
thought
a
triumph
of
engineering
the
boiler
was
in
sections
and
provided
with
a
pump
the
wheels
were
very
large
which
lessened
the
loss
of
power
the
was
lofty
which
increased
the
draught
on
the
other
hand
the
size
of
the
wheels
exposed
them
to
the
force
of
the
waves
and
the
height
of
the
to
the
violence
of
the
wind
wooden
iron
clamps
bosses
of
such
were
the
wheels
which
well
constructed
could
strange
though
it
may
seem
be
taken
to
pieces
three
floats
were
always
under
water
the
speed
of
the
centre
of
the
floats
only
exceeded
by
a
sixth
the
speed
of
the
vessel
itself
this
was
the
chief
defect
of
the
wheels
moreover
the
cranks
were
too
long
and
the
caused
too
much
friction
in
the
admission
of
steam
into
the
cylinder
for
that
period
the
engine
seemed
and
indeed
was
admirable
it
had
been
constructed
in
france
at
the
works
at
bercy
mess
lethierry
had
roughly
sketched
it
the
engineer
who
had
constructed
it
in
accordance
with
his
diagram
was
dead
so
that
the
engine
was
unique
and
probably
could
not
have
been
replaced
the
designer
still
lived
but
the
constructor
was
no
more
the
engine
had
cost
forty
thousand
francs
lethierry
had
himself
constructed
the
devil
boat
upon
the
great
covered
stocks
by
the
side
of
the
first
tower
between
peter
port
and
sampson
he
had
been
to
brême
to
buy
the
wood
all
his
skill
as
a
shipwright
was
exhausted
in
its
construction
his
ingenuity
might
be
seen
in
the
planks
the
seams
of
which
were
straight
and
even
and
covered
with
sarangousti
an
indian
mastic
better
than
resin
the
sheathing
was
well
beaten
to
remedy
the
roundness
of
the
hull
lethierry
had
fitted
out
a
boom
at
the
bowsprit
which
allowed
him
to
add
a
false
spritsail
to
the
regular
one
on
the
day
of
the
launch
he
cried
aloud
at
last
i
am
afloat
the
vessel
was
successful
in
fact
as
the
reader
has
already
learnt
either
by
chance
or
design
she
had
been
launched
on
the
of
july
the
anniversary
of
the
taking
of
the
bastille
on
that
day
mounted
upon
the
bridge
between
the
two
looked
lethierry
upon
the
sea
and
exclaimed
it
is
your
turn
now
the
parisians
took
the
bastille
now
science
takes
the
sea
lethierry
boat
made
the
voyage
from
guernsey
to
malo
once
a
week
she
started
on
the
tuesday
morning
and
returned
on
the
friday
evening
in
time
for
the
saturday
market
she
was
a
stronger
craft
than
any
of
the
largest
coasting
sloops
in
all
the
archipelago
and
her
capacity
being
in
proportion
to
her
dimensions
one
of
her
voyages
was
equal
to
four
voyages
of
an
ordinary
boat
in
the
same
trade
hence
they
were
very
profitable
the
reputation
of
a
vessel
depends
on
its
stowage
and
lethierry
was
an
admirable
stower
of
cargo
when
he
was
no
longer
able
to
work
himself
he
trained
up
a
sailor
to
undertake
this
duty
at
the
end
of
two
years
the
steamboat
brought
in
a
clear
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
a
year
or
eighteen
thousand
francs
the
pound
sterling
of
guernsey
is
worth
francs
only
that
of
england
and
that
of
jersey
these
differences
are
less
unimportant
than
they
seem
the
banks
at
all
events
know
how
to
turn
them
to
advantage
vi
lethierry
exaltation
the
devil
boat
prospered
mess
lethierry
began
to
look
forward
to
the
time
when
he
should
be
called
monsieur
at
guernsey
people
do
not
become
monsieurs
at
one
bound
between
the
plain
man
and
the
gentleman
there
is
quite
a
scale
to
climb
to
begin
with
we
have
the
simple
name
plain
peter
let
us
suppose
the
second
step
is
neighbour
peter
the
third
father
peter
the
fourth
sieur
peter
the
fifth
mess
peter
and
then
we
reach
the
summit
in
monsieur
peter
this
scale
ascending
thus
from
the
ground
is
carried
to
still
greater
heights
all
the
upper
classes
of
england
join
on
and
continue
it
here
are
the
various
steps
becoming
more
and
more
glorious
above
the
monsieur
or
there
is
the
esquire
above
the
squire
the
knight
above
the
knight
still
rising
we
have
the
baronet
the
scotch
laird
the
baron
the
viscount
the
earl
called
count
in
france
and
jarl
in
norway
the
marquis
the
duke
the
prince
of
the
blood
royal
and
the
king
so
by
degrees
we
ascend
from
the
people
to
the
middle
class
from
the
middle
class
to
the
baronetage
from
the

to
the

to

thanks
to
his
successful
ingenuity
thanks
to
steam
and
his
engines
and
the
devil

mess
lethierry
was
fast
becoming
an
important
personage
when
building
his
vessel
he
had
been
compelled
to
borrow
money
he
had
become
indebted
at
brême
he
had
become
indebted
at
malo
but
every
year
he
diminished
his
obligations
he
had
moreover
purchased
on
credit
at
the
very
entrance
to
the
port
of
sampson
a
pretty
house
entirely
new
situate
between
the
sea
and
a
garden
on
the
corner
of
this
house
was
inscribed
the
name
of
the
bravées
its
front
formed
a
part
of
the
wall
of
the
port
itself
and
it
was
remarkable
for
a
double
row
of
windows
on
the
north
alongside
a
little
enclosure
filled
with
flowers
and
on
the
south
commanding
a
view
of
the
ocean
it
had
thus
two
one
open
to
the
tempest
and
the
sea
the
other
looking
into
a
garden
filled
with
roses
these
two
frontages
seemed
made
for
the
two
inmates
of
the
house
mess
lethierry
and
déruchette
the
bravées
was
popular
at
sampson
for
mess
lethierry
had
at
length
become
a
popular
man
this
popularity
was
due
partly
to
his
good
nature
his
devotedness
and
his
courage
partly
to
the
number
of
lives
he
had
saved
and
a
great
deal
to
his
success
and
to
the
fact
that
he
had
awarded
to
sampson
the
honour
of
being
the
port
of
the
departure
and
arrival
of
the
new
steamboat
having
made
the
discovery
that
the
devil
boat
was
decidedly
a
success
peter
the
capital
desired
to
obtain
it
for
that
port
but
lethierry
held
fast
to
sampson
it
was
his
native
town
it
was
there
that
i
was
first
pitched
into
the
water
he
used
to
say
hence
his
great
local
popularity
his
position
as
a
small
landed
proprietor
paying
made
him
what
they
call
in
guernsey
an
he
was
chosen
douzenier
the
poor
sailor
had
mounted
five
out
of
six
steps
of
the
guernsey
social
scale
he
had
attained
the
dignity
of
mess
he
was
rapidly
approaching
the
monsieur
and
who
could
predict
whether
he
might
not
even
rise
higher
than
that
who
could
say
that
they
might
not
one
day
find
in
the
almanack
of
guernsey
under
the
heading
of
nobility
and
gentry
the
astonishing
and
superb
inscription
but
mess
lethierry
had
nothing
of
vanity
in
his
nature
or
he
had
no
sense
of
it
or
if
he
had
disdained
it
to
know
that
he
was
useful
was
his
greatest
pleasure
to
be
popular
touched
him
less
than
being
necessary
he
had
as
we
have
already
said
only
two
objects
of
delight
and
consequently
only
two
ambitions
the
durande
and
déruchette
however
this
may
have
been
he
had
embarked
in
the
lottery
of
the
sea
and
had
gained
the
chief
prize
this
chief
prize
was
the
durande
steaming
away
in
all
her
pride
vii
the
same
godfather
and
the
same
patron
saint
having
created
his
steamboat
lethierry
had
christened
it
he
had
called
it
durande
la
durande
we
will
speak
of
her
henceforth
by
no
other
name
we
will
claim
the
liberty
also
in
spite
of
typographical
usage
of
not
italicising
this
name
durande
conforming
in
this
to
the
notion
of
mess
lethierry
in
whose
eyes
la
durande
was
almost
a
living
person
durande
and
déruchette
are
the
same
name
déruchette
is
the
diminutive
this
diminutive
is
very
common
in
france
in
the
country
the
names
of
saints
are
endowed
with
all
these
diminutives
as
well
as
all
their
augmentatives
one
might
suppose
there
were
several
persons
when
there
is
in
fact
only
one
this
system
of
patrons
and
patronesses
under
different
names
is
by
no
means
rare
lise
lisette
lisa
elisa
isabelle
lisbeth
betsy
all
these
are
simply
elizabeth
it
is
probable
that
mahout
maclou
malo
and
magloire
are
the
same
saint
this
however
we
do
not
vouch
for
saint
durande
is
a
saint
of
and
of
the
charente
whether
she
is
an
orthodox
member
of
the
calendar
is
a
question
for
the
bollandists
orthodox
or
not
she
has
been
made
the
patron
saint
of
numerous
chapels
it
was
while
lethierry
was
a
young
sailor
at
rochefort
that
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
saint
probably
in
the
person
of
some
pretty
charantaise
perhaps
in
that
of
the
grisette
with
the
white
nails
the
saint
had
remained
sufficiently
in
his
memory
for
him
to
give
the
name
to
the
two
things
which
he
loved
most
durande
to
the
steamboat
déruchette
to
the
girl
of
one
he
was
the
father
of
the
other
the
uncle
déruchette
was
the
daughter
of
a
brother
who
had
died
she
was
an
orphan
child
he
had
adopted
her
and
had
taken
the
place
both
of
father
and
mother
déruchette
was
not
only
his
niece
she
was
his
godchild
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
at
the
baptismal
font
it
was
he
who
had
chosen
her
patron
saint
durande
and
her
christian
name
déruchette
déruchette
as
we
have
said
was
born
at
peter
port
her
name
was
inscribed
at
its
date
on
the
register
of
the
parish
as
long
as
the
niece
was
a
child
and
the
uncle
poor
nobody
took
heed
of
her
appellation
of
déruchette
but
when
the
little
girl
became
a
miss
and
the
sailor
a
gentleman
the
name
of
déruchette
shocked
the
feelings
of
guernsey
society
the
uncouthness
of
the
sound
astonished
every
one
folks
asked
mess
lethierry
why
déruchette
he
answered
it
is
a
very
good
name
in
its
way
several
attempts
were
made
to
get
him
to
obtain
a
change
in
the
baptismal
name
but
he
would
be
no
party
to
them
one
day
a
fine
lady
of
the
upper
circle
of
society
in
sampson
the
wife
of
a
rich
retired
ironfounder
said
to
mess
lethierry
in
future
i
shall
call
your
daughter
nancy
if
names
of
country
towns
are
in
fashion
said
he
why
not
lons
le
saulnier
the
fine
lady
did
not
yield
her
point
and
on
the
morrow
said
we
are
determined
not
to
have
it
déruchette
i
have
found
for
your
daughter
a
pretty
name
a
very
pretty
name
indeed
replied
mess
lethierry
composed
of
two
words
which
signify
a
husband
and
an
ass
he
held
fast
to
déruchette
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
infer
from
lethierry
pun
that
he
had
no
wish
to
see
his
niece
married
he
desired
to
see
her
married
certainly
but
in
his
own
way
he
intended
her
to
have
a
husband
after
his
own
heart
one
who
would
work
hard
and
whose
wife
would
have
little
to
do
he
liked
rough
hands
in
a
man
and
delicate
ones
in
a
woman
to
prevent
déruchette
spoiling
her
pretty
hands
he
had
always
brought
her
up
like
a
young
lady
he
had
provided
her
with
a
a
piano
a
little
library
and
a
few
needles
and
threads
in
a
pretty
she
was
indeed
more
often
reading
than
stitching
more
often
playing
than
reading
this
was
as
mess
lethierry
wished
it
to
be
charming
was
all
that
he
expected
of
her
he
had
reared
the
young
girl
like
a
flower
whoever
has
studied
the
character
of
sailors
will
understand
this
rude
and
hard
in
their
nature
they
have
an
odd
partiality
for
grace
and
delicacy
to
realise
the
idea
of
the
uncle
the
niece
ought
to
have
been
rich
so
indeed
felt
mess
lethierry
his
steamboat
voyaged
for
this
end
the
mission
of
durande
was
to
provide
a
marriage
portion
for
déruchette
footnotes
a
play
upon
the
french
words

viii
bonnie
dundee
déruchette
occupied
the
prettiest
room
at
the
bravées
it
had
two
windows
was
furnished
with
various
articles
made
of
mahogany
had
a
bed
with
four
curtains
green
and
white
and
looked
out
upon
the
garden
and
beyond
it
towards
the
high
hill
on
which
stands
the
vale
castle
gilliatt
house
the
bû
de
la
rue
was
on
the
other
side
of
this
hill
déruchette
had
her
music
and
piano
in
this
chamber
she
accompanied
herself
on
the
instrument
when
singing
the
melody
which
she
preferred
the
melancholy
scottish
air
of
bonnie
dundee
the
very
spirit
of
night
breathes
in
this
melody
but
her
voice
was
full
of
the
freshness
of
dawn
the
contrast
was
quaint
and
pleasing
people
said
miss
déruchette
is
at
her
piano
the
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
stopped
sometimes
before
the
wall
of
the
garden
of
the
bravées
to
listen
to
that
sweet
voice
and
plaintive
song
déruchette
was
the
very
embodiment
of
joy
as
she
went
to
and
fro
in
the
house
she
brought
with
her
a
perpetual
spring
she
was
beautiful
but
more
pretty
than
beautiful
and
still
more
graceful
than
pretty
she
reminded
the
good
old
pilots
friends
of
mess
lethierry
of
that
princess
in
the
song
which
the
soldiers
and
sailors
sing
who
was
so
beautiful
passait
pour
telle
dans
le
regiment
mess
lethierry
used
to
say
she
has
a
head
of
hair
like
a
cable
from
her
infancy
she
had
been
remarkable
for
beauty
the
learned
in
such
matters
had
grave
doubts
about
her
nose
but
the
little
one
having
probably
determined
to
be
pretty
had
finally
satisfied
their
requirements
she
grew
to
girlhood
without
any
serious
loss
of
beauty
her
nose
became
neither
too
long
nor
too
short
and
when
grown
up
her
critics
admitted
her
to
be
charming
she
never
addressed
her
uncle
otherwise
than
as
father
lethierry
allowed
her
to
soil
her
fingers
a
little
in
gardening
and
even
in
some
kind
of
household
duties
she
watered
her
beds
of
pink
hollyhocks
purple
foxgloves
perennial
phloxes
and
scarlet
herb
bennets
she
took
good
advantage
of
the
climate
of
guernsey
so
favourable
to
flowers
she
had
like
many
other
persons
there
aloes
in
the
open
ground
and
what
is
more
difficult
she
succeeded
in
cultivating
the
nepaulese
cinquefoil
her
little
was
scientifically
arranged
she
was
able
to
produce
from
it
several
kinds
of
rare
vegetables
she
sowed
dutch
cauliflower
and
brussels
cabbages
which
she
thinned
out
in
july
turnips
for
august
endive
for
september
short
parsnip
for
the
autumn
and
rampions
for

mess
lethierry
did
not
interfere
with
her
in
this
so
long
as
she
did
not
handle
the
spade
and
rake
too
much
or
meddle
with
the
coarser
kinds
of
garden
labour
he
had
provided
her
with
two
servants
one
named
grace
and
the
other
douce
which
are
favourite
names
in
guernsey
grace
and
douce
did
the
hard
work
of
the
house
and
garden
and
they
had
the
right
to
have
red
hands
with
regard
to
mess
lethierry
his
room
was
a
little
retreat
with
a
view
over
the
harbour
and
communicating
with
the
great
lower
room
of
the
ground
floor
on
which
was
situated
the
door
of
the
house
near
which
the
various
staircases
met
his
room
was
furnished
with
his
hammock
his
chronometer
and
his
pipe
there
were
also
a
table
and
a
chair
the
ceiling
had
been
whitewashed
as
well
as

four
walls

fine
marine
map
bearing
the
inscription

his
majesty
and
representing

nailed
up
at
the
side
of

and
on

left
stretched
out
and
fastened
with

as

something
of

creole

their
character
a
sort
of
slowness

grace
coquettish
and
was
always
scanning
the
future
with
a
nervous
anxiety
this
arose
from
the
fact
of

pure

good
as

for
the
rest
the
intrigues
of

were
cautiously
concealed
mess
lethierry
knew
nothing
of
such
matters
and
no
token
of
them
had
ever
reached

the
lower
room
of
the
ground
floor
a
hall
with
a
large
fireplace

surrounded
with
benches

served
in
the
last
century
as
a
for
a
conventicle
of
french
protestant
refugees
the
sole
ornament
of
the
bare
stone
wall
was
a
sheet
of
parchment
set
in
a
frame
of
black
wood
on
which
were
represented
some
of
the
charitable
deeds
of

hung
this

on

preserve
the
remembrance
of
those
facts
the
spectator
who
had
the
patience
to
decipher

was
a
little
corner
with
a
wooden
partition

had
been
the
sanctum
and
had
become

to
its
row
of
rails
and
a
small
hole
to
pass
paper
or
money
through
the
steamboat
office
that
is
to
say
the
office
of
the
durande
kept
by
mess
lethierry
in
person
upon
the
old
oaken
where
once
rested
the
holy
bible
lay
a
great
ledger
with
its
alternate
pages

and
cr
ix
the
man
who
discovered
rantaine
character
as
long
as
mess
lethierry
had
been
able
to
do
duty
he
had
commanded
the
durande
and
had
had
no
other
pilot
or
captain
but
himself
but
a
time
had
come
as
we
have
said
when
he
had
been
compelled
to
find
a
successor
he
had
chosen
for
that
purpose
sieur
clubin
of
torteval
a
taciturn
man
sieur
clubin
had
a
character
upon
the
coast
for
strict
probity
he
became
the
the
double
of
mess
lethierry
sieur
clubin
although
he
had
rather
the
look
of
a
notary
than
of
a
sailor
was
a
mariner
of
rare
skill
he
had
all
the
talents
which
are
required
to
meet
dangers
of
every
kind
he
was
a
skilful
stower
a
safe
man
aloft
an
able
and
careful
boatswain
a
powerful
steersman
an
experienced
pilot
and
a
bold
captain
he
was
prudent
and
he
carried
his
prudence
sometimes
to
the
point
of
daring
which
is
a
great
quality
at
sea
his
natural
apprehensiveness
of
danger
was
tempered
by
a
strong
instinct
of
what
was
possible
in
an
emergency
he
was
one
of
those
mariners
who
will
face
risks
to
a
point
perfectly
well
known
to
themselves
and
who
generally
manage
to
come
successfully
out
of
every
peril
every
certainty
which
a
man
can
command
dealing
with
so
fickle
an
element
as
the
sea
he
possessed
sieur
clubin
moreover
was
a
renowned
swimmer
he
was
one
of
that
race
of
men
broken
into
the
buffeting
of
the
waves
who
can
remain
as
long
as
they
please
in
the
water
who
can
start
from

colettes
swim
round
the
hermitage
and
castle
elizabeth
and
return
in
two
hours
to
the
point
from
which
they
started
he
came
from
torteval
where
he
had
the
reputation
of
often
having
swum
across
the
passage
so
much
dreaded
from
the
hanway
rocks
to
the
point
of
pleinmont
one
circumstance
which
had
recommended
sieur
clubin
to
mess
lethierry
more
than
any
other
was
his
having
judged
correctly
the
character
of
rantaine
he
had
pointed
out
to
lethierry
the
dishonesty
of
the
man
and
had
said
rantaine
will
rob
you
his
prediction
was
verified
more
than
once
in
matters
it
is
true
not
very
important
mess
lethierry
had
put
his
honesty
to
the
proof
and
he
freely
communicated
with
him
on
the
subject
of
his
affairs
mess
lethierry
used
to
say
a
good
conscience
expects
to
be
treated
with
perfect
confidence
x
long
yarns
mess
lethierry
for
the
sake
of
his
own
ease
always
wore
his
seafaring
clothes
and
preferred
his
tarpaulin
overcoat
to
his
pilot
jacket
déruchette
felt
vexed
occasionally
about
this
peculiarity
nothing
is
prettier
than
a
pouting
beauty
she
laughed
and
scolded
my
dear
father
she
would
say
what
a
smell
of
pitch
and
she
would
give
him
a
gentle
tap
upon
his
broad
shoulders
this
good
old
seaman
had
gathered
from
his
voyages
many
wonderful
stories
he
had
seen
at
madagascar
birds
feathers
three
of
which
sufficed
to
make
a
roof
of
a
house
he
had
seen
in
india
field
sorrel
the
stalks
of
which
were
nine
inches
high
in
new
holland
he
had
seen
troops
of
turkeys
and
geese
led
about
and
guarded
by
a
bird
like
a
flock
by
a
shepherd
dog
this
bird
was
called
the
agami
he
had
visited
elephants
cemeteries
in
africa
he
had
encountered
gorillas
a
terrible
species
of
he
knew
the
ways
of
all
the
ape
tribe
from
the
wild
monkey
which
he
called
the
to
the
howling
monkey
or
in
chili
he
had
seen
a
pouched
monkey
move
the
compassion
of
the
huntsman
by
showing
its
little
one
he
had
seen
in
california
a
hollow
trunk
of
a
tree
fall
to
the
ground
so
vast
that
a
man
on
horseback
could
ride
one
hundred
paces
inside
in
morocco
he
had
seen
the
mozabites
and
the
bisskris
fighting
with
matraks
and
bars
of
iron
the
bisskris
because
they
had
been
called
which
means
dogs
and
the
mozabites
because
they
had
been
treated
as
which
means
people
of
the
fifth
sect
he
had
seen
in
china
the
pirate
cut
to
pieces
for
having
assassinated
the
ap
of
a
village
at
he
had
seen
a
lion
carry
off
an
old
woman
in
the
open
he
was
present
at
the
arrival
of
the
great
serpent
brought
from
canton
to
saigon
to
celebrate
in
the
pagoda
of
the
fête
of
the
goddess
of
navigators
he
had
beheld
the
great
among
the
moi
at
rio
de
janeiro
he
had
seen
the
brazilian
ladies
in
the
evening
put
little
balls
of
gauze
into
their
hair
each
containing
a
beautiful
kind
of
firefly
and
the
whole
forming
a
of
little
twinkling
lights
he
had
combated
in
paraguay
with
swarms
of
enormous
ants
and
spiders
big
and
downy
as
an
infant
head
and
compassing
with
their
long
legs
a
third
of
a
yard
and
attacking
men
by
pricking
them
with
their
bristles
which
enter
the
skin
as
sharp
as
arrows
and
raise
painful
blisters
on
the
river
arinos
a
tributary
of
the
tocantins
in
the
virgin
forests
to
the
north
of
diamantina
he
had
determined
the
existence
of
the
famous
people
the
murcilagos
or
men
who
are
born
with
white
hair
and
red
eyes
who
live
in
the
shady
solitudes
of
the
woods
sleep
by
day
awake
by
night
and
fish
and
hunt
in
the
dark
seeing
better
then
than
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
told
how
near
beyrout
once
in
an
encampment
of
an
expedition
of
which
he
formed
part
a
rain
gauge
belonging
to
one
of
the
party
happened
to
be
stolen
from
a
tent
a
wizard
wearing
two
or
three
strips
of
leather
only
and
looking
like
a
man
having
nothing
on
but
his
braces
thereupon
rang
a
bell
at
the
end
of
a
horn
so
violently
that
a
hyena
finally
answered
the
summons
by
bringing
back
the
missing
instrument
the
hyena
was
in
fact
the
thief
these
veritable
histories
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
fictions
but
they
amused
déruchette
the
or
doll
of
the
durande
as
the
people
of
the
channel
islands
call
the
of
a
ship
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
vessel
and
lethierry
niece
in
the
norman
islands
the
of
a
ship
a
wooden
statue
is
called
the
poupée
hence
the
local
saying
meaning
to
sail
entre
poupe
et
the
of
the
durande
was
particularly
dear
to
mess
lethierry
he
had
instructed
the
carver
to
make
it
resemble
déruchette
it
looked
like
a
rude
attempt
to
cut
out
a
face
with
a
hatchet
or
like
a
clumsy
log
trying
hard
to
look
like
a
girl
this
unshapely
block
produced
a
great
effect
upon
mess
imagination
he
looked
upon
it
with
an
almost
superstitious
admiration
his
faith
in
it
was
complete
he
was
able
to
trace
in
it
an
excellent
resemblance
to
déruchette
thus
the
dogma
resembles
the
truth
and
the
idol
the
deity
mess
lethierry
had
two
grand
fête
days
in
every
week
one
was
tuesday
the
other
friday
his
first
delight
consisted
in
seeing
the
durande
weigh
anchor
his
second
in
seeing
her
enter
the
port
again
he
leaned
upon
his
elbows
at
the
window
contemplating
his
work
and
was
happy
on
fridays
the
presence
of
mess
lethierry
at
his
window
was
a
signal
when
people
passing
the
bravées
saw
him
lighting
his
pipe
they
said
ay
the
steamboat
is
in
sight
one
kind
of
smoke
was
the
herald
of
the
other
the
durande
when
she
entered
the
port
made
her
cable
fast
to
a
huge
iron
ring
under
mess
lethierry
window
and
fixed
in
the
basement
of
the
house
on
those
nights
lethierry
slept
soundly
in
his
hammock
with
a
soothing
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
déruchette
asleep
in
her
room
near
him
and
of
the
durande
moored
opposite
the
moorings
of
the
durande
were
close
to
the
great
bell
of
the
port
a
little
strip
of
quay
passed
thence
before
the
door
of
the
bravées
the
quay
the
bravées
and
its
house
the
garden
the
alleys
bordered
with
edges
and
the
greater
part
even
of
the
surrounding
houses
no
longer
exist
the
demand
for
guernsey
granite
has
invaded
these
too
the
whole
of
this
part
of
the
town
is
now
occupied
by
yards
xi
matrimonial
prospects
déruchette
was
approaching
womanhood
and
was
still
unmarried
mess
lethierry
in
bringing
her
up
to
have
white
hands
had
also
rendered
her
somewhat
fastidious
a
training
of
that
kind
has
its
disadvantages
but
lethierry
was
himself
still
more
fastidious
he
would
have
liked
to
have
provided
at
the
same
time
for
both
his
idols
to
have
found
in
the
guide
and
companion
of
the
one
a
commander
for
the
other
what
is
a
husband
but
the
pilot
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
why
not
then
the
same
conductor
for
the
vessel
and
for
the
girl
the
affairs
of
a
household
have
their
tides
their
ebbs
and
flows
and
he
who
knows
how
to
steer
a
bark
ought
to
know
how
to
guide
a
woman
destiny
subject
as
both
are
to
the
influences
of
the
moon
and
the
wind
sieur
clubin
being
only
fifteen
years
younger
than
lethierry
would
necessarily
be
only
a
provisional
master
for
the
durande
it
would
be
necessary
to
find
a
young
captain
a
permanent
master
a
true
successor
of
the
founder
inventor
and
creator
of
the
first
channel
steamboat
a
captain
for
the
durande
who
should
come
up
to
his
ideal
would
have
been
already
almost
a
in
lethierry
eyes
why
not
make
him
in
a
double
sense
the
idea
pleased
him
the
husband
of
déruchette
haunted
his
dreams
his
ideal
was
a
powerful
seaman
tanned
and
browned
by
weather
a
sea
athlete
this
however
was
not
exactly
the
ideal
of
déruchette
her
dreams
if
dreams
they
could
even
be
called
were
of
a
more
ethereal
character
the
uncle
and
the
niece
were
at
all
events
agreed
in
not
being
in
haste
to
seek
a
solution
of
these
problems
when
déruchette
began
to
be
regarded
as
a
probable
heiress
a
crowd
of
suitors
had
presented
themselves
attentions
under
these
circumstances
are
not
generally
worth
much
mess
lethierry
felt
this
he
would
grumble
out
the
old
french
proverb
maiden
of
gold
a
suitor
of
he
politely
showed
the
to
the
door
he
was
content
to
wait
and
so
was
déruchette
it
was
perhaps
a
singular
fact
that
he
had
little
inclination
for
the
local
aristocracy
in
that
respect
mess
lethierry
showed
himself
not
entirely
english
it
will
hardly
be
believed
that
he
even
refused
for
déruchette
a
ganduel
of
jersey
and
a
bugnet
nicolin
of
sark
people
were
bold
enough
to
affirm
although
we
doubt
if
this
were
possible
that
he
had
even
declined
the
proposals
of
a
member
of
the
family
of
edou
which
is
evidently
descended
from
anglicè
edward
the
confessor
xii
an
anomaly
in
the
character
of
lethierry
mess
lethierry
had
a
failing
and
a
serious
one
he
detested
a
priest
though
not
as
an
individual
but
as
an
institution
reading
one
day
for
he
used
to
read
in
a
work
of
voltaire
for
he
would
even
read
voltaire
the
remark
that
priests
have
something
in
their
nature
he
laid
down
the
book
and
was
heard
to
mutter
then
i
suppose
i
have
something
in
mine
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
priests
lutheran
and
calvinist
as
well
as
catholic
had
vigorously
combated
the
new
devil
boat
and
had
persecuted
its
inventor
to
be
a
sort
of
revolutionist
in
the
art
of
navigation
to
introduce
a
spirit
of
progress
in
the
norman
archipelago
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
poor
little
island
of
guernsey
with
a
new
invention
was
in
their
eyes
as
we
have
not
concealed
from
the
reader
an
abominable
and
most
condemnable
rashness
nor
had
they
omitted
to
condemn
it
pretty
loudly
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
we
are
now
speaking
of
the
guernsey
clergy
of
a
bygone
generation
very
different
from
that
of
the
present
time
who
in
almost
all
the
local
places
of
worship
display
a
laudable
sympathy
with
progress
they
had
embarrassed
lethierry
in
a
hundred
ways
every
sort
of
resisting
force
which
can
be
found
in
sermons
and
discourses
had
been
employed
against
him
detested
by
the
churchmen
he
naturally
came
to
detest
them
in
his
turn
their
hatred
was
the
extenuating
circumstance
to
be
taken
into
account
in
judging
of
his
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
dislike
for
priests
was
in
some
degree
in
his
very
nature
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
them
to
hate
him
in
order
to
inspire
him
with
aversion
as
he
said
he
moved
among
them
like
the
dog
among
cats
he
had
an
antipathy
to
them
not
only
in
idea
but
in
what
is
more
difficult
to
analyse
his
instincts
he
felt
their
secret
claws
and
showed
his
teeth
sometimes
it
must
be
confessed
a
little
at
random
and
out
of
season
it
is
a
mistake
to
make
no
distinctions
a
dislike
in
the
mass
is
a
prejudice
the
good
savoyard
curé
would
have
found
no
favour
in
his
eyes
it
is
not
certain
that
a
worthy
priest
was
even
a
possible
thing
in
lethierry
mind
his
philosophy
was
carried
so
far
that
his
good
sense
sometimes
abandoned
him
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
intolerance
of
tolerants
as
well
as
the
violence
of
moderates
but
lethierry
was
at
bottom
too
to
be
a
thorough
hater
he
did
not
attack
so
much
as
avoid
he
kept
the
church
people
at
a
distance
he
suffered
evil
at
their
hands
but
he
confined
himself
to
not
wishing
them
any
good
the
shade
of
difference
in
fact
between
his
aversion
and
theirs
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
bore
animosity
while
he
had
only
a
strong
antipathy
small
as
is
the
island
of
guernsey
it
has
unfortunately
plenty
of
room
for
differences
of
religion
there
to
take
the
broad
distinction
is
the
catholic
faith
and
the
protestant
faith
every
form
of
worship
has
its
temple
or
chapel
in
germany
at
heidelberg
for
example
people
are
not
so
particular
they
divide
a
church
in
two
one
half
for
peter
the
other
half
for
calvin
and
between
the
two
is
a
partition
to
prevent
religious
variances
terminating
in
fisticuffs
the
shares
are
equal
the
catholics
have
three
altars
the
huguenots
three
altars
as
the
services
are
at
the
same
hours
one
bell
summonses
both
denominations
to
prayers
it
rings
in
fact
both
for
god
and
for
satan
according
as
each
pleases
to
regard
it
nothing
can
be
more
simple
the
phlegmatic
character
of
the
germans
favours
i
suppose
this
peculiar
arrangement
but
in
guernsey
every
religion
has
its
own
domicile
there
is
the
orthodox
parish
and
the
heretic
parish
the
individual
may
choose
neither
one
nor
the
other
was
the
choice
of
mess
lethierry
this
sailor
workman
philosopher
and
parvenu
trader
though
a
simple
man
in
appearance
was
by
no
means
simple
at
bottom
he
had
his
opinions
and
his
prejudices
on
the
subject
of
the
priests
he
was
immovable
he
would
have
entered
the
lists
with
montlosier
occasionally
he
indulged
in
rather
disrespectful
jokes
upon
this
subject
he
had
certain
odd
expressions
thereupon
peculiar
to
himself
but
significant
enough
going
to
confession
he
called
combing
conscience
the
little
learning
that
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
reading
picked
up
here
and
there
between
the
squalls
at
sea
did
not
prevent
his
making
blunders
in
spelling
he
made
also
mistakes
in
pronunciation
some
of
which
however
gave
a
double
sense
to
his
words
which
might
have
been
suspected
of
a
sly
intention
after
peace
had
been
brought
about
by
waterloo
between
the
france
of
louis
xviii
and
the
england
of
wellington
mess
lethierry
was
heard
to
say
bour
mont
a
été
le
traître
entre
les
deux
camps
on
one
occasion
he
wrote
for
we
do
not
think
these
puns
were
intentional
though
he
was
a
strong
that
circumstance
was
far
from
conciliating
the
anglicans
he
was
no
more
liked
by
the
protestant
rectors
than
by
the
catholic
curés
the
enunciation
of
the
greatest
dogmas
did
not
prevent
his
temper
bursting
forth
accident
for
example
having
once
brought
him
to
hear
a
sermon
on
eternal
punishment
by
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
a
magnificent
discourse
filled
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
sacred
texts
proving
the
everlasting
pains
the
tortures
the
torments
the
perditions
the
inexorable
chastisements
the
burnings
without
end
the
inextinguishable
maledictions
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
the
celestial
fury
the
divine
vengeance
and
other
incontestable
realities
he
was
heard
to
say
as
he
was
going
out
in
the
midst
of
the
faithful
flock
you
see
i
have
an
odd
notion
of
my
own
on
this
matter
i
imagine
god
as
a
merciful
being
this
leaven
of
atheism
was
doubtless
due
to
his
sojourn
in
france
although
a
guernsey
man
of
pure
extraction
he
was
called
in
the
island
the
frenchman
but
chiefly
on
account
of
his
improper
manner
of
speaking
he
did
not
indeed
conceal
the
truth
from
himself
he
was
impregnated
with
ideas
subversive
of
established
institutions
his
obstinacy
in
constructing
the
devil
boat
had
proved
that
he
used
to
say
i
was
suckled
by
the
a
bad
sort
of
nurse
these
were
not
his
only
indiscretions
in
france
to
preserve
appearances
in
england
to
be
respectable
is
the
chief
condition
of
a
quiet
life
to
be
respectable
implies
a
multitude
of
little
observances
from
the
strict
keeping
of
sunday
down
to
the
careful
tying
of
a
cravat
to
act
so
that
nobody
may
point
at
you
this
is
the
terrible
social
law
to
be
pointed
at
with
the
finger
is
almost
the
same
thing
as
an
anathematisation
little
towns
always
hotbeds
of
gossip
are
remarkable
for
that
isolating
malignancy
which
is
like
the
tremendous
malediction
of
the
church
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
telescope
the
bravest
are
afraid
of
this
ordeal
they
are
ready
to
confront
the
storm
the
fire
of
cannon
but
they
shrink
at
the
glance
of
mrs
grundy
mess
lethierry
was
more
obstinate
than
logical
but
under
pressure
even
his
obstinacy
would
bend
he
put
to
use
another
of
his
phrases
eminently
suggestive
of
latent
compromises
not
always
pleasant
to
avow
a
little
water
in
his
wine
he
kept
aloof
from
the
clergy
but
he
did
not
absolutely
close
his
door
against
them
on
official
occasions
and
at
the
customary
epochs
of
pastoral
visits
he
received
with
sufficiently
good
grace
both
the
lutheran
rector
and
the
papist
chaplain
he
had
even
though
at
distant
intervals
accompanied
déruchette
to
the
anglican
parish
church
to
which
déruchette
herself
as
we
have
said
only
went
on
the
four
great
festivals
of
the
year
on
the
whole
these
little
concessions
which
always
cost
him
a
pang
irritated
him
and
far
from
inclining
him
towards
the
church
people
only
increased
his
inward
disinclination
to
them
he
compensated
himself
by
more
raillery
his
nature
in
general
so
devoid
of
bitterness
had
no
uncharitable
side
except
this
to
alter
him
however
was
impossible
in
fact
this
was
in
his
very
temperament
and
was
beyond
his
own
power
to
control
every
sort
of
priest
or
clergyman
was
distasteful
to
him
he
had
a
little
of
the
old
revolutionary
want
of
reverence
he
did
not
distinguish
between
one
form
of
worship
and
another
he
did
not
do
justice
to
that
great
step
in
the
progress
of
ideas
the
denial
of
the
real
presence
his
shortsightedness
in
these
matters
even
prevented
his
perceiving
any
essential
difference
between
a
minister
and
an
abbé
a
reverend
doctor
and
a
reverend
father
were
pretty
nearly
the
same
to
him
he
used
to
say
wesley
is
not
more
to
my
taste
than
loyola
when
he
saw
a
reverend
pastor
walking
with
his
wife
he
would
turn
to
look
at
them
and
mutter
a
married
priest
in
a
tone
which
brought
out
all
the
absurdity
which
those
words
had
in
the
ears
of
frenchmen
at
that
time
he
used
to
relate
how
on
his
last
voyage
to
england
he
had
seen
the
of
london
his
dislike
for
marriages
of
that
sort
amounted
almost
to
disgust
gown
and
gown
do
not
mate
well
he
would
say
the
sacerdotal
function
was
to
him
in
the
nature
of
a
distinct
sex
it
would
have
been
natural
to
him
to
have
said
neither
a
man
nor
a
woman
only
a
priest
and
he
had
the
bad
taste
to
apply
to
the
anglican
and
the
roman
catholic
clergy
the
same
disdainful
epithets
he
confounded
the
two
cassocks
in
the
same
phraseology
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
vary
in
favour
of
catholics
or
lutherans
or
whatever
they
might
be
the
figures
of
speech
common
among
military
men
of
that
period
he
would
say
to
déruchette
marry
whom
you
please
provided
you
do
not
marry
a
parson
xiii
thoughtlessness
adds
a
grace
to
beauty
a
word
once
said
mess
lethierry
remembered
it
a
word
once
said
déruchette
soon
forgot
it
here
was
another
difference
between
the
uncle
and
the
niece
brought
up
in
the
peculiar
way
already
described
déruchette
was
little
accustomed
to
responsibility
there
is
a
latent
danger
in
an
education
not
sufficiently
serious
which
can
not
be
too
much
insisted
on
it
is
perhaps
unwise
to
endeavour
to
make
a
child
happy
too
soon
so
long
as
she
was
happy
déruchette
thought
all
was
well
she
knew
too
that
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
her
uncle
to
see
her
pleased
the
religious
sentiment
in
her
nature
was
satisfied
with
going
to
the
parish
church
four
times
in
the
year
we
have
seen
her
in
her
toilet
of
life
she
was
entirely
ignorant
she
had
a
disposition
which
one
day
might
lead
her
to
love
passionately
meanwhile
she
was
contented
she
sang
by
fits
and
starts
chatted
by
fits
and
starts
enjoyed
the
hour
as
it
passed
fulfilled
some
little
duty
and
was
gone
again
and
was
delightful
in
all
add
to
all
this
the
english
sort
of
liberty
which
she
enjoyed
in
england
the
very
infants
go
alone
girls
are
their
own
mistresses
and
adolescence
is
almost
wholly
unrestrained
such
are
the
differences
of
manners
later
how
many
of
these
free
maidens
become
female
slaves
i
use
the
word
in
its
least
odious
sense
i
mean
that
they
are
free
in
the
development
of
their
nature
but
slaves
to
duty
déruchette
awoke
every
morning
with
little
thought
of
her
actions
of
the
day
before
it
would
have
troubled
her
a
good
deal
to
have
had
to
give
an
account
of
how
she
had
spent
her
time
the
previous
week
all
this
however
did
not
prevent
her
having
certain
hours
of
strange
disquietude
times
when
some
dark
cloud
seemed
to
pass
over
the
brightness
of
her
joy
those
azure
depths
are
subject
to
such
shadows
but
clouds
like
these
soon
passed
away
she
quickly
shook
off
such
moods
with
a
cheerful
laugh
knowing
neither
why
she
had
been
sad
nor
why
she
had
regained
her
serenity
she
was
always
at
play
as
a
child
she
would
take
delight
in
teasing
the
she
played
practical
jokes
upon
the
boys
if
the
fiend
himself
had
passed
that
way
she
would
hardly
have
spared
him
some
ingenious
trick
she
was
pretty
and
innocent
and
she
could
abuse
the
immunity
accorded
to
such
qualities
she
was
ready
with
a
smile
as
a
cat
with
a
stroke
of
her
claws
so
much
the
worse
for
the
victim
of
her
scratches
she
thought
no
more
of
them
yesterday
had
no
existence
for
her
she
lived
in
the
fullness
of
such
it
is
to
have
too
much
happiness
fall
to
one
lot
with
déruchette
impressions
vanished
like
the
melted
snow
book
iv
the
bagpipe
i
streaks
of
fire
on
the
horizon
gilliatt
had
never
spoken
to
déruchette
he
knew
her
from
having
seen
her
at
a
distance
as
men
know
the
morning
star
at
the
period
when
déruchette
had
met
gilliatt
on
the
road
leading
from
peter
port
to
vale
and
had
surprised
him
by
tracing
his
name
in
the
snow
she
was
just
sixteen
years
of
age
only
the
evening
before
mess
lethierry
had
said
to
her
come
no
more
childish
tricks
you
are
a
great
girl
that
word
gilliatt
written
by
the
young
maiden
had
sunk
into
an
unfathomed
depth
what
were
women
to
gilliatt
he
could
not
have
answered
that
question
himself
when
he
met
one
he
generally
inspired
her
with
something
of
the
timidity
which
he
felt
himself
he
never
spoke
to
a
woman
except
from
urgent
necessity
he
had
never
played
the
part
of
a
gallant
to
any
one
of
the
country
girls
when
he
found
himself
alone
on
the
road
and
perceived
a
woman
coming
towards
him
he
would
climb
over
a
fence
or
bury
himself
in
some
copse
he
even
avoided
old
women
once
in
his
life
he
had
seen
a
parisian
lady
a
on
the
wing
was
a
strange
event
in
guernsey
at
that
distant
epoch
and
gilliatt
had
heard
this
gentle
lady
relate
her
little
troubles
in
these
words
i
am
very
much
annoyed
i
have
got
some
spots
of
rain
upon
my
bonnet
pale
buff
is
a
shocking
colour
for
rain
having
found
some
time
afterwards
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
an
old
engraving
representing
a
lady
of
the
chaussée
in
full
dress
he
had
stuck
it
against
the
wall
at
home
as
a
souvenir
of
this
remarkable
apparition
on
that
christmas
morning
when
he
had
met
déruchette
and
when
she
had
written
his
name
and
disappeared
laughing
he
returned
home
scarcely
conscious
of
why
he
had
gone
out
that
night
he
slept
little
he
was
dreaming
of
a
thousand
things
that
it
would
be
well
to
cultivate
black
radishes
in
the
garden
that
he
had
not
seen
the
boat
from
sark
pass
by
had
anything
happened
to
it
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
seen
the
white
stonecrop
in
flower
a
rare
thing
at
that
season
he
had
never
known
exactly
who
was
the
woman
who
had
reared
him
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
she
must
have
been
his
mother
and
thought
of
her
with
redoubled
tenderness
he
called
to
mind
the
lady
clothing
in
the
old
leathern
trunk
he
thought
that
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
would
probably
one
day
or
other
be
appointed
dean
of
peter
port
and
surrogate
of
the
bishop
and
that
the
rectory
of
sampson
would
become
vacant
next
he
remembered
that
the
morrow
of
christmas
would
be
the
day
of
the
moon
and
that
consequently
high
water
would
be
at
minutes
past
three
the
at
a
quarter
past
seven
low
water
at
minutes
past
nine
and
half
flood
at
minutes
past
twelve
he
recalled
in
the
most
trifling
details
the
costume
of
the
highlander
who
had
sold
him
the
bagpipe
his
bonnet
with
a
thistle
ornament
his
claymore
his
short
jacket
his
philabeg
ornamented
with
a
pocket
and
his
his
pin
set
with
a
scottish
stone
his
two
girdles
his
sash
and
belts
his
sword
cutlass
dirk
and
his
knife
with
its
black
handle
ornamented
with
two
cairngorms
and
the
bare
knees
of
the
soldier
his
socks
gaiters
and
buckled
shoes
this
figure
became
a
spectre
in
his
imagination
which
pursued
him
with
a
sense
of
feverishness
as
he
sunk
into
oblivion
when
he
awoke
it
was
full
daylight
and
his
first
thought
was
of
déruchette
the
next
night
he
slept
more
soundly
but
he
was
dreaming
again
of
the
scottish
soldier
in
the
midst
of
his
sleep
he
remembered
that
the
sittings
of
the
chief
law
court
would
commence
on
the
of
january
he
dreamed
also
about
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
he
thought
of
déruchette
and
seemed
to
be
in
violent
anger
with
her
he
wished
he
had
been
a
child
again
to
throw
stones
at
her
windows
then
he
thought
that
if
he
were
a
child
again
he
should
have
his
mother
by
his
side
and
he
began
to
sob
gilliatt
had
a
project
at
this
time
of
going
to
pass
three
months
at
chousey
or
at
the
miriquiers
but
he
did
not
go
he
walked
no
more
along
the
road
to
peter
port
he
had
an
odd
fancy
that
his
name
of
gilliatt
had
remained
there
traced
upon
the
ground
and
that
the
stopped
to
read
it
ii
the
unknown
unfolds
itself
by
degrees
on
the
other
hand
gilliatt
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
bravées
every
day
by
some
accident
he
was
continually
passing
that
way
his
business
seemed
always
to
lead
him
by
the
path
which
passed
under
the
wall
of
déruchette
garden
one
morning
as
he
was
walking
along
this
path
he
heard
a
who
was
returning
from
the
bravées
say
to
another
mess
lethierry
is
fond
of
he
dug
in
his
garden
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
a
trench
for
the
is
a
vegetable
which
has
a
flavour
like
asparagus
the
wall
of
the
garden
of
the
bravées
was
very
low
it
would
have
been
easy
to
scale
it
the
idea
of
scaling
it
would
have
appeared
to
him
terrible
but
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
his
hearing
as
any
one
else
might
the
voices
of
persons
talking
as
he
passed
in
the
rooms
or
in
the
garden
he
did
not
listen
but
he
heard
them
once
he
could
distinguish
the
voices
of
the
two
servants
grace
and
douce
disputing
it
was
a
sound
which
belonged
to
the
house
and
their
quarrel
remained
in
his
ears
like
a
remembrance
of
music
on
another
occasion
he
distinguished
a
voice
which
was
different
and
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
voice
of
déruchette
he
quickened
his
pace
and
was
soon
out
of
hearing
the
words
uttered
by
that
voice
however
remained
fixed
in
his
memory
he
repeated
them
at
every
instant
they
were
will
you
please
give
me
the
little
broom
by
degrees
he
became
bolder
he
had
the
daring
to
stay
awhile
one
day
it
happened
that
déruchette
was
singing
at
her
piano
altogether
invisible
from
without
although
her
window
was
open
the
air
was
that
of
bonnie
dundee
he
grew
pale
but
he
screwed
his
courage
to
the
point
of
listening
springtide
came
one
day
gilliatt
enjoyed
a
beatific
vision
the
heavens
were
opened
and
there
before
his
eyes
appeared
déruchette
watering
lettuces
in
her
little
garden
soon
afterwards
he
look
to
doing
more
than
merely
listening
there
he
watched
her
habits
observed
her
hours
and
waited
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
in
all
this
he
was
very
careful
not
to
be
seen
the
year
advanced
the
time
came
when
the
trellises
were
heavy
with
roses
and
haunted
by
the
butterflies
by
little
and
little
he
had
come
to
conceal
himself
for
hours
behind
her
wall
motionless
and
silent
seen
by
no
one
and
holding
his
breath
as
déruchette
passed
in
and
out
of
her
garden
men
grow
accustomed
to
poison
by
degrees
from
his
he
could
often
hear
the
sound
of
déruchette
conversing
with
mess
lethierry
under
a
thick
arch
of
leaves
in
a
spot
where
there
was
a
the
words
came
distinctly
to
his
ears
what
a
change
had
come
over
him
he
had
even
descended
to
watch
and
listen
alas
there
is
something
of
the
character
of
a
spy
in
every
human
heart
there
was
another
visible
to
him
and
nearer
déruchette
would
sit
there
sometimes
from
the
flowers
that
he
had
observed
her
gathering
he
had
guessed
her
taste
in
the
matter
of
perfumes
the
scent
of
the
bindweed
was
her
favourite
then
the
pink
then
the
honeysuckle
then
the
jasmine
the
rose
stood
only
fifth
in
the
scale
she
looked
at
the
lilies
but
did
not
smell
them
gilliatt
figured
her
in
his
imagination
from
this
choice
of
odours
with
each
perfume
he
associated
some
perfection
the
very
idea
of
speaking
to
déruchette
would
have
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
a
poor
old
whose
wandering
brought
her
from
time
to
time
into
the
little
road
leading
under
the
inclosure
of
the
bravées
had
occasionally
remarked
gilliatt
assiduity
beside
the
wall
and
his
devotion
for
this
retired
spot
did
she
connect
the
presence
of
a
man
before
this
wall
with
the
possibility
of
a
woman
behind
it
did
she
perceive
that
vague
invisible
thread
was
she
in
her
decrepit
mendicancy
still
youthful
enough
to
remember
something
of
the
old
happier
days
and
could
she
in
this
dark
night
and
winter
of
her
wretched
life
still
recognise
the
dawn
we
know
not
but
it
appears
that
on
one
occasion
passing
near
gilliatt
at
his
post
she
brought
to
bear
upon
him
something
as
like
a
smile
as
she
was
still
capable
of
and
muttered
between
her
teeth
it
is
getting
warmer
gilliatt
heard
the
words
and
was
struck
by
them
it
warms
one
he
muttered
with
an
inward
note
of
interrogation
it
is
getting
warmer
what
did
the
old
woman
mean
he
repeated
the
phrase
mechanically
all
day
but
he
could
not
guess
its
meaning
iii
the
air
bonnie
dundee
finds
an
echo
on
the
hill
it
was
in
a
spot
behind
the
enclosure
of
the
garden
of
the
bravées
at
an
angle
of
the
wall
half
concealed
with
holly
and
ivy
and
covered
with
nettles
wild
mallow
and
large
white
mullen
growing
between
the
blocks
of
stone
that
he
passed
the
greater
part
of
that
summer
he
watched
there
lost
in
deep
thought
the
lizards
grew
accustomed
to
his
presence
and
basked
in
the
sun
among
the
same
stones
the
summer
was
bright
and
full
of
dreamy
indolence
overhead
the
light
clouds
came
and
went
gilliatt
sat
upon
the
grass
the
air
was
full
of
the
songs
of
birds
he
held
his
two
hands
up
to
his
forehead
sometimes
trying
to
recollect
himself
why
should
she
write
my
name
in
the
snow
from
a
distance
the
sea
breeze
came
up
in
gentle
breaths
at
intervals
the
horn
of
the
quarrymen
sounded
abruptly
warning
the
to
take
shelter
as
they
shattered
some
mass
with
gunpowder
the
port
of
sampson
was
not
visible
from
this
place
but
he
could
see
the
tips
of
masts
above
the
trees
the
flew
wide
and
afar
gilliatt
had
heard
his
mother
say
that
women
could
love
men
that
such
things
happened
sometimes
he
remembered
it
and
said
within
himself
who
knows
may
not
déruchette
love
me
then
a
feeling
of
sadness
would
come
upon
him
he
would
say
she
too
thinks
of
me
in
her
turn
it
is
well
he
remembered
that
déruchette
was
rich
and
that
he
was
poor
and
then
the
new
boat
appeared
to
him
an
execrable
invention
he
could
never
remember
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
he
would
stare
listlessly
at
the
great
bees
with
their
yellow
bodies
and
their
short
wings
as
they
entered
with
a
buzzing
noise
into
the
holes
in
the
wall
one
evening
déruchette
went
to
retire
to
bed
she
approached
her
window
to
close
it
the
night
was
dark
suddenly
something
caught
her
ear
and
she
listened
somewhere
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
sound
of
music
it
was
some
one
perhaps
on
the
or
at
the
foot
of
the
towers
of
vale
castle
or
perhaps
further
still
playing
an
air
upon
some
instrument
déruchette
recognised
her
favourite
melody
bonnie
dundee
played
upon
the
bagpipe
she
thought
little
of
it
from
that
night
the
music
might
be
heard
again
from
time
to
time
at
the
same
hours
particularly
when
the
nights
were
very
dark
déruchette
was
not
much
pleased
with
all
this
iv
a
serenade
by
night
may
please
a
lady
fair
but
of
uncle
and
of
guardian
let
the
troubadour
beware
four
years
passed
away
déruchette
was
approaching
her
year
and
was
still
unmarried
some
writer
has
said
that
a
fixed
idea
is
a
sort
of
gimlet
every
year
gives
it
another
turn
to
pull
out
the
first
year
is
like
plucking
out
the
hair
by
the
roots
in
the
second
year
like
tearing
the
skin
in
the
third
like
breaking
the
bones
and
in
the
fourth
like
removing
the
very
brain
itself
gilliatt
had
arrived
at
this
fourth
stage
he
had
never
yet
spoken
a
word
to
déruchette
he
lived
and
dreamed
near
that
delightful
vision
this
was
all
it
happened
one
day
that
finding
himself
by
chance
at
sampson
he
had
seen
déruchette
talking
with
mess
lethierry
at
the
door
of
the
bravées
which
opens
upon
the
roadway
of
the
port
gilliatt
ventured
to
approach
very
near
he
fancied
that
at
the
very
moment
of
his
passing
she
had
smiled
there
was
nothing
impossible
in
that
déruchette
still
heard
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
the
bagpipe
mess
lethierry
had
also
heard
this
bagpipe
by
degrees
he
had
come
to
remark
this
persevering
musician
under
déruchette
window
a
tender
strain
too
all
the
more
suspicious
a
nocturnal
gallant
was
a
thing
not
to
his
taste
his
wish
was
to
marry
déruchette
in
his
own
time
when
she
was
willing
and
he
was
willing
purely
and
simply
without
any
romance
or
music
or
anything
of
that
sort
irritated
at
it
he
had
at
last
kept
a
watch
and
he
fancied
that
he
had
detected
gilliatt
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
beard
a
sign
of
anger
and
grumbled
out
what
has
that
fellow
got
to
pipe
about
he
is
in
love
with
déruchette
that
is
clear
you
waste
your
time
young
man
any
one
who
wants
déruchette
must
come
to
me
and
not
loiter
about
playing
the
flute
an
event
of
importance
long
foreseen
occurred
soon
afterwards
it
was
announced
that
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
was
appointed
surrogate
of
the
bishop
of
winchester
dean
of
the
island
and
rector
of
port
and
that
he
would
leave
sampson
for
peter
immediately
after
his
successor
should
be
installed
it
could
not
be
long
to
the
arrival
of
the
new
rector
he
was
a
gentleman
of
norman
extraction
monsieur
ebenezer
caudray
some
facts
were
known
about
the
new
rector
which
the
benevolent
and
malevolent
interpreted
in
a
contrary
sense
he
was
known
to
be
young
and
poor
but
his
youth
was
tempered
with
much
learning
and
his
poverty
by
good
expectations
in
the
dialect
specially
invented
for
the
subject
of
riches
and
inheritances
death
goes
by
the
name
of
expectations
he
was
the
nephew
and
heir
of
the
aged
and
opulent
dean
of
asaph
at
the
death
of
this
old
gentleman
he
would
be
a
rich
man
caudray
had
distinguished
relations
he
was
almost
entitled
to
the
quality
of
honourable
as
regarded
his
doctrine
people
judged
differently
he
was
an
anglican
but
according
to
the
expression
of
bishop
tillotson
a
libertine
that
is
in
reality
one
who
was
very
severe
he
repudiated
all
pharisaism
he
was
a
friend
rather
of
the
presbytery
than
the
episcopacy
he
dreamed
of
the
primitive
church
of
the
days
when
even
adam
had
the
right
to
choose
his
eve
and
when
frumentinus
bishop
of
hierapolis
carried
off
a
young
maiden
to
make
her
his
wife
and
said
to
her
parents
her
will
is
such
and
such
is
mine
you
are
no
longer
her
mother
and
you
are
no
longer
her
father
i
am
the
bishop
of
hierapolis
and
this
is
my
wife
her
father
is
in
heaven
if
the
common
belief
could
be
trusted
caudray
subordinated
the
text
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
to
that
other
text
in
his
eyes
of
higher
significance
the
woman
is
the
flesh
of
the
man
she
shall
leave
her
father
and
mother
to
follow
her
husband
this
tendency
however
to
circumscribe
the
parental
authority
and
to
favour
religiously
every
mode
of
forming
the
conjugal
tie
is
peculiar
to
all
protestantism
particularly
in
england
and
singularly
so
in
america
v
a
deserved
success
has
always
its
detractors
at
this
period
the
affairs
of
mess
lethierry
were
in
this
position
the
durande
had
well
fulfilled
all
his
expectations
he
had
paid
his
debts
repaired
his
misfortunes
discharged
his
obligations
at
brême
met
his
acceptances
at
malo
he
had
paid
off
the
mortgage
upon
his
house
at
the
bravées
and
had
bought
up
all
the
little
local
rent
charges
upon
the
property
he
was
also
the
proprietor
of
a
great
productive
capital
this
was
the
durande
herself
the
net
revenue
from
the
boat
was
about
a
thousand
pounds
sterling
per
annum
and
the
traffic
was
constantly
increasing
strictly
speaking
the
durande
constituted
his
entire
fortune
she
was
also
the
fortune
of
the
island
the
carriage
of
cattle
being
one
of
the
most
profitable
portions
of
her
trade
he
had
been
obliged
in
order
to
facilitate
the
stowage
and
the
embarking
and
disembarking
of
animals
to
do
away
with
the
and
the
two
boats
it
was
perhaps
imprudent
the
durande
had
but
one
boat
namely
her
but
this
was
an
excellent
one
ten
years
had
elapsed
since
rantaine
robbery
this
prosperity
of
the
durande
had
its
weak
point
it
inspired
no
confidence
people
regarded
it
as
a
risk

upon

to

a
lucky
rashness

who
had
imitated
him
had
not
succeeded
the
enterprise
had
ruined
the
shareholders
the

were
badly
constructed

obstinately

the
fanatical

it
is
all
very
well
but

could
not

it
a

encouraging

phenomenon
there
exist
upon
the
ocean
three
regions
of
fogs
one
equatorial
and
two
polar
the
mariners
give
them
but
one
name
the
in
all
latitudes
and
particularly
in
the
channel
the
equinoctial
fogs
are
dangerous
they
shed
a
sudden
darkness
over
the
sea
one
of
the
perils
of
fogs
even
when
not
very
dense
arises
from
their
preventing
the
mariners
perceiving
the
change
of
the
bed
of
the
sea
by
the
variations
of
the
colour
of
the
water
the
result
is
a
dangerous
concealment
of
the
approach
of
sands
and
breakers
the
vessel
steers
towards
the
shoals
without
receiving
any
warning
frequently
the
fogs
leave
a
ship
no
resource
except
to
or
to
cast
anchor
there
are
as
many
shipwrecks
from
the
fogs
as
from
the
winds
after
a
very
violent
squall
succeeding
one
of
these
foggy
days
the
arrived
safely
from
england
it
entered
at
peter
port
as
the
first
gleam
of
day
appeared
upon
the
sea
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
cannon
of
castle
cornet
announced
the
break
of
day
the
sky
had
cleared
the
sloop
was
anxiously
expected
as
she
was
to
bring
the
new
rector
of
sampson
a
little
after
the
arrival
of
the
sloop
a
rumour
ran
through
the
town
that
she
had
been
hailed
during
the
night
at
sea
by
a
containing
a
shipwrecked
crew
vii
how
an
idler
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
seen
by
a
fisherman
on
that
very
night
at
the
moment
when
the
wind
abated
gilliatt
had
gone
out
with
his
nets
without
however
taking
his
famous
old
dutch
boat
too
far
from
the
coast
as
he
was
returning
with
the
rising
tide
towards
two
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
he
passed
before
the
beast
horn
to
reach
the
little
bay
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
at
that
moment
he
fancied
that
he
saw
in
the
projection
of
the
seat
a
shadow
which
was
not
that
of
the
rock
he
steered
his
vessel
nearer
and
was
able
to
perceive
a
man
sitting
in
the
the
sea
was
already
very
high
the
rock
encircled
by
the
waves
and
escape
entirely
cut
off
gilliatt
made
signs
to
the
man
the
stranger
remained
motionless
gilliatt
drew
nearer
the
man
was
asleep
he
was
attired
in
black
he
looks
like
a
priest
thought
gilliatt
he
approached
still
nearer
and
could
distinguish
the
face
of
a
young
man
the
features
were
unknown
to
him
the
rock
happily
was
peaked
there
was
a
good
depth
gilliatt
wore
off
and
succeeded
in
skirting
the
rocky
wall
the
tide
raised
the
bark
so
high
that
gilliatt
by
standing
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
sloop
could
touch
the
man
feet
he
raised
himself
upon
the
planking
and
stretched
out
his
hands
if
he
had
fallen
at
that
moment
it
is
doubtful
if
he
would
have
risen
again
on
the
water
the
waves
were
rolling
in
between
the
boat
and
the
rock
and
destruction
would
have
been
inevitable
he
pulled
the
foot
of
the
sleeping
man
ho
there
what
are
you
doing
in
this
place
the
man
aroused
and
muttered
i
was
looking
about
he
was
now
completely
awake
and
continued
i
have
just
arrived
in
this
part
i
came
this
way
on
a
pleasure
trip
i
have
passed
the
night
on
the
sea
the
view
from
here
seemed
beautiful
i
was
weary
and
fell
asleep
ten
minutes
later
and
you
would
have
been
drowned
ha
jump
into
my
bark
gilliatt
kept
the
bark
fast
with
his
foot
clutched
the
rock
with
one
hand
and
stretched
out
the
other
to
the
stranger
in
black
who
sprang
quickly
into
the
boat
he
was
a
fine
young
man
gilliatt
seized
the
tiller
and
in
two
minutes
his
boat
entered
the
bay
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
the
young
man
wore
a
round
hat
and
a
white
cravat
and
his
long
black
was
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
he
had
fair
hair
which
he
wore
he
had
a
somewhat
feminine
cast
of
features
a
clear
eye
a
grave
manner
meanwhile
the
boat
had
touched
the
ground
gilliatt
passed
the
cable
through
the
then
turned
and
perceived
the
young
man
holding
out
a
sovereign
in
a
very
white
hand
gilliatt
moved
the
hand
gently
away
there
was
a
pause
the
young
man
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
you
have
saved
me
from
death
perhaps
replied
gilliatt
the
moorings
were
made
fast
and
they
went
ashore
the
stranger
continued
i
owe
you
my
life
sir
no
matter
this
reply
from
gilliatt
was
again
followed
by
a
pause
do
you
belong
to
this
parish
no
replied
gilliatt
to
what
parish
then
gilliatt
lifted
up
his
right
hand
pointed
to
the
sky
and
said
to
that
yonder
the
young
man
bowed
and
left
him
after
walking
a
few
paces
the
stranger
stopped
felt
in
his
pocket
drew
out
a
book
and
returning
towards
gilliatt
offered
it
to
him
permit
me
to
make
you
a
present
of
this
gilliatt
took
the
volume
it
was
a
bible
an
instant
after
gilliatt
leaning
upon
the
parapet
was
following
the
young
man
with
his
eyes
as
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
path
which
led
to
sampson
by
little
and
little
he
lowered
his
gaze
forgot
all
about
the
stranger
knew
no
more
whether
the
existed
everything
disappeared
before
him
in
the
bottomless
depth
of
a
reverie
there
was
one
abyss
which
swallowed
up
all
his
thought
this
was
déruchette
a
voice
calling
him
aroused
him
from
this
dream
ho
there
gilliatt
he
recognised
the
voice
and
looked
up
what
is
the
matter
sieur
landoys
it
was
in
fact
sieur
landoys
who
was
passing
along
the
road
about
one
hundred
paces
from
the
bû
de
la
rue
in
his
phaeton
drawn
by
one
little
horse
he
had
stopped
to
hail
gilliatt
but
he
seemed
hurried
there
is
news
gilliatt
where
is
that
at
the
bravées
what
is
it
i
am
too
far
off
to
tell
you
the
story
gilliatt
shuddered
is
miss
déruchette
going
to
be
married
no
but
she
had
better
look
out
for
a
husband
what
do
you
mean
go
up
to
the
house
and
you
will
learn
and
sieur
landoys
whipped
on
his
horse
book
v
the
revolver
i
conversations
at
the
jean
auberge
sieur
clubin
was
a
man
who
bided
his
time
he
was
short
in
stature
and
his
complexion
was
yellow
he
had
the
strength
of
a
bull
his
sea
life
had
not
tanned
his
skin
his
flesh
had
a
sallow
hue
it
was
the
colour
of
a
wax
candle
of
which
his
eyes
too
had
something
of
the
steady
light
his
memory
was
peculiarly
retentive
with
him
to
have
seen
a
man
once
was
to
have
him
like
a
note
in
a
his
quiet
glance
took
possession
of
you
the
pupil
of
his
eye
received
the
impression
of
a
face
and
kept
it
like
a
portrait
the
face
might
grow
old
but
sieur
clubin
never
lost
it
it
was
impossible
to
cheat
that
tenacious
memory
sieur
clubin
was
curt
in
speech
grave
in
manner
bold
in
action
no
gestures
were
ever
indulged
in
by
him
an
air
of
candour
won
everybody
to
him
at
first
many
people
thought
him
artless
he
had
a
wrinkle
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
astonishingly
expressive
of
simplicity
as
we
have
said
no
abler
mariner
existed
no
one
like
him
for
reefing
a
sail
for
keeping
a
vessel
head
to
the
wind
or
the
sails
well
set
never
did
reputation
for
religion
and
integrity
stand
higher
than
his
to
have
suspected
him
would
have
been
to
bring
yourself
under
suspicion
he
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
monsieur
rébuchet
a
at
malo
who
lived
in
the
rue
vincent
next
door
to
the
armourer
and
monsieur
rébuchet
would
say
i
would
leave
my
shop
in
clubin
hands
sieur
clubin
was
a
widower
his
wife
like
himself
had
enjoyed
a
high
reputation
for
probity
she
had
died
with
a
fame
for
incorruptible
virtue
if
the
bailli
had
whispered
gallant
things
in
her
ear
she
would
have
impeached
him
before
the
king
if
a
saint
had
made
love
to
her
she
would
have
told
it
to
the
priest
this
couple
sieur
and
dame
clubin
had
realised
in
torteval
the
ideal
of
the
english
epithet
respectable
dame
clubin
reputation
was
as
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
swan
sieur
clubin
like
that
of
ermine
itself
a
spot
would
have
been
fatal
to
him
he
could
hardly
have
picked
up
a
pin
without
making
inquiries
for
the
owner
he
would
send
round
the
about
a
box
of
matches
one
day
he
went
into
a
at
servan
and
said
to
the
man
who
kept
it
three
years
ago
i
breakfasted
here
you
made
a
mistake
in
the
bill
and
he
returned
the
man
thirteen
sous
he
was
the
very
personification
of
probity
with
a
certain
compression
of
the
lips
indicative
of
watchfulness
he
seemed
indeed
always
on
the
watch
for
what
for
rogues
probably
every
tuesday
he
commanded
the
durande
on
her
passage
from
guernsey
to
malo
he
arrived
at
malo
on
the
tuesday
evening
stayed
two
days
there
to
discharge
and
take
in
a
new
cargo
and
started
again
for
guernsey
on
friday
morning
there
was
at
that
period
at
malo
a
little
tavern
near
the
harbour
which
was
called
the
jean
auberge
the
construction
of
the
modern
quays
swept
away
this
house
at
this
period
the
sea
came
up
as
far
as
the
vincent
and
dinan
gates
merlan
and
servan
communicated
with
each
other
by
covered
carts
and
other
vehicles
which
passed
to
and
fro
among
vessels
lying
high
and
dry
avoiding
the
buoys
the
anchors
and
cables
and
running
the
risk
now
and
then
of
smashing
their
leathern
hoods
against
the
lowered
yards
or
the
end
of
a
jibboom
between
the
tides
the
coachmen
drove
their
horses
over
those
sands
where
six
hours
afterwards
the
winds
would
be
beating
the
rolling
waves
the
carrying
dogs
of
malo
who
tore
to
pieces
a
naval
officer
in
were
accustomed
to
prowl
about
this
beach
this
excess
of
zeal
on
their
part
led
to
the
destruction
of
the
pack
their
nocturnal
barkings
are
no
longer
heard
between
the
little
and
the
great
talard
sieur
clubin
was
accustomed
to
stay
at
the
jean
auberge
the
french
office
of
the
durande
was
held
there
the
officers
and
came
to
take
their
meals
and
to
drink
at
the
jean
auberge
they
had
their
separate
tables
the
officers
of
binic
found
it
convenient
for
the
service
to
meet
there
with
their
brother
officers
of
malo
captains
of
vessels
came
there
also
but
they
ate
at
another
table
sieur
clubin
sat
sometimes
at
one
sometimes
at
the
other
table
but
preferred
the
table
of
the
men
to
that
of
the
sea
captains
he
was
always
welcome
at
either
the
tables
were
well
served
there
were
strange
drinks
especially
provided
for
foreign
sailors
a
dandy
sailor
from
bilboa
could
have
been
supplied
there
with
a
people
drank
stout
there
as
at
greenwich
or
brown
as
at
antwerp
masters
of
vessels
who
came
from
long
voyages
and
privateersmen
sometimes
appeared
at
the
captains
table
where
they
exchanged
news
how
are
sugars
that
commission
is
only
for
small
the
brown
kinds
however
are
going
off
three
thousand
bags
of
east

and
five
hundred
hogsheads
of
take
my
word
the
opposition
will
end

all
these
things
were
talked
about
and
commented
on
aloud
at
the
table
of
the
and
officers
they
spoke
in
a
lower
key
matters
of
police
and
revenue
on
the
coast
and
in
the
ports
require
in
fact
a
little
more
privacy
and
a
little
less
clearness
in
the
conversation
the
table
was
presided
over
by
an
old
captain
of
a
large
vessel
could
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
man
he
was
rather
a
living
barometer
his
long
life
at
sea
had
given
him
a
surprising
power
of
prognosticating
the
state
of
the
weather
he
seemed
to
issue
a
decree
for
the
weather
he
sounded
the
winds
and
felt
the
pulse
as
it
were
of
the
tides
he
might
be
imagined
requesting
the
clouds
to
show
their
tongue
that
is
to
say
their
forked
lightnings
he
was
the
physician
of
the
wave
the
breeze
and
the
squall
the
ocean
was
his
patient
he
had
travelled
round
the
world
like
a
doctor
going
his
visits
examining
every
kind
of
climate
in
its
good
and
bad
condition
he
was
profoundly
versed
in
the
pathology
of
the
seasons
sometimes
he
would
be
heard
delivering
himself
in
this
fashion
the
barometer
descended
in
to
three
degrees
below
tempest
point
he
was
a
sailor
from
real
love
of
the
sea
he
hated
england
as
much
as
he
liked
the
ocean
he
had
carefully
studied
english
seamanship
and
considered
himself
to
have
discovered
its
weak
point
he
would
explain
how
the
of
differed
from
the
of
and
from
the
of
he
compared
their
build
as
to
their
forecastles
and
he
looked
back
with
regret
to
the
towers
upon
the
deck
and
the
tops
of
the
of
probably
regarding
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
convenient
for
french
in
his
eyes
nations
only
existed
for
their
naval
institutions
he
indulged
in
some
odd
figures
of
speech
on
this
subject
he
considered
the
term
the
trinity
house
as
sufficiently
indicating
england
the
northern
commissioners
were
in
like
manner
synonymous
in
his
mind
with
scotland
the
ballast
board
with
ireland
he
was
full
of
nautical
information
he
was
in
himself
a
marine
alphabet
and
almanack
a
tariff
and
mark
all
combined
he
knew
by
heart
all
the
lighthouse
dues
particularly
those
of
the
english
coast
one
penny
per
ton
for
passing
before
this
one
farthing
before
that
he
would
tell
you
that
the
small
rock
light
which
once
used
to
burn
two
hundred
gallons
of
oil
now
consumes
fifteen
hundred
once
aboard
ship
he
was
attacked
by
a
dangerous
disease
and
was
believed
to
be
dying
the
crew
assembled
round
his
hammock
and
in
the
midst
of
his
groans
and
agony
he
addressed
the
chief
carpenter
with
the
words
you
had
better
make
a
mortise
in
each
side
of
the
main
caps
and
put
in
a
bit
of
iron
to
help
pass
the
top
ropes
through
his
habit
of
command
had
given
to
his
countenance
an
expression
of
authority
it
was
rare
that
the
subjects
of
conversation
at
the
captains
table
and
at
that
of
the
men
were
the
same
this
however
did
happen
to
be
the
case
in
the
first
days
of
that
month
of
february
to
which
the
course
of
this
history
has
now
brought
us
the
captain
zuela
arrived
from
chili
and
bound
thither
again
was
the
theme
of
discussion
at
both
tables
at
the
captains
table
they
were
talking
of
her
cargo
and
at
that
of
the
people
of
certain
circumstances
connected
with
her
recent
proceedings
captain
zuela
of
copiapo
was
partly
a
chilian
and
partly
a
columbian
he
had
taken
a
part
in
the
war
of
independence
in
a
true
independent
fashion
adhering
sometimes
to
bolivar
sometimes
to
morillo
according
as
he
had
found
it
to
his
interest
he
had
enriched
himself
by
serving

man
in
the
world
could
have
been
more
bourbonist
more
bonapartist
more
absolutist
more
liberal
more
atheistical
or
more
devoutly
catholic
he
belonged
to
that
great
and
renowned
party
which
may
be
called
the
lucrative
party
from
time
to
time
he
made
his
appearance
in
france
on
commercial
voyages
and
if
report
spoke
truly
he
willingly
gave
a
passage
to
fugitives
of
any
kind
bankrupts
or
political
refugees
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
provided
they
could
pay
his
mode
of
taking
them
aboard
was
simple
the
fugitive
waited
upon
a
lonely
point
of
the
coast
and
at
the
moment
of
setting
sail
zuela
would
detach
a
small
boat
to
fetch
him
on
his
last
voyage
he
had
assisted
in
this
way
an
outlaw
and
fugitive
from
justice
named
berton
and
on
this
occasion
he
was
suspected
of
being
about
to
aid
the
flight
of
the
men
implicated
in
the
affair
of
the
bidassoa
the
police
were
informed
and
had
their
eye
upon
him
this
period
was
an
epoch
of
flights
and
escapes
the
restoration
in
france
was
a
reactionary
movement
revolutions
are
fruitful
of
voluntary
exile
and
restorations
of
wholesale
banishments
during
the
first
seven
or
eight
years
which
followed
the
return
of
the
bourbons
panic
was
universal
in

in
industry
in
commerce
men
felt
the
ground
tremble
beneath
them
bankruptcies
were
numerous
in
the
commercial
world
in
the
political
there
was
a
general
rush
to
escape
lavalette

taken

lefebvre
desnouettes
had
taken

special

the
pont
de

the
esplanade
de

the
wall
of
the
observatoire
in
paris
the
tower
of
taurias
dismal
landmarks
in
history
where
the
period
of
reaction
has
left
its
on
which
the
marks
of
that
hand
are
still
visible
in
london
the
thistlewood
affair
with
its
ramifications
in
france
in
paris
the
trogoff
trial
with
its
ramifications
in
belgium
switzerland
and
italy
had
increased
the
motives
for
anxiety
and
flight
and
given
an
impetus
to
that
mysterious
rout
which
left
so
many
gaps
in
the
social
system
of
that
day
to
find
a
place
of
safety
this
was
the
general
care
to
be
implicated
was
to
be
ruined
the
spirit
of
the
military
tribunals
had
survived
their
institution
sentences
were
matters
of

people
fled
to

glorious
yet
forlorn
was
the
only
resource
left
nothing
perhaps
seems
simpler
than
flight
but
that
monosyllable
has
a
terrible
significance
every
obstacle
is
in
the
way
of
the
man
who
slips
away
taking
to
flight
necessitates
disguise
persons
of
importance
even
illustrious
characters
were
reduced
to
these
expedients
only
fit
for
malefactors
their
independent
habits
rendered
it
difficult
for
them
to
escape
through
the
meshes
of
authority
a
rogue
who
violates
the
conditions
of
his
comports
himself
before
the
police
as
innocently
as
a
saint
but
imagine
innocence
constrained

disguising
its
voice
a
glorious
reputation
hiding
under
a
mask
yonder
is
a
man
of
celebrity
he
is
in
quest
of
a
false
passport
the
equivocal
proceedings
of
one
absconding
from
the
reach
of
the
law
is
no
proof
that
he
is
not
a
hero
ephemeral
but
characteristic
features
of
the
time
of
which
our
regular
history
takes
no
note
but
which
the
true
painter
of
the
age
will
bring
out
into
relief
under
cover
of
these
flights
and
concealments
of
honest
men
genuine
rogues
less
watched
and
suspected
managed
often
to
get
clear
off
a
scoundrel
who
found
it
convenient
to
disappear
would
take
advantage
of
the
general
tack
himself
on
to
the
political
refugees
and
thanks
to
his
greater
skill
in
the
art
would
contrive
to
appear
in
that
dim
twilight
more
honest
even
than
his
honest
neighbours
nothing
looks
more
awkward
and
confused
sometimes
than
honesty
unjustly
condemned
it
is
out
of
its
element
and
is
almost
sure
to
commit
itself
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
this
voluntary
expatriation
particularly
with
honest
folks
appeared
to
lead
to
every
strange
turn
of
fortune
the
modicum
of
civilisation
which
a
scamp
brought
with
him
from
london
or
paris
became
perhaps
a
valuable
stock
in
trade
in
some
primitive
country
ingratiated
him
with
the
people
and
enabled
him
to
strike
into
new
paths
there
is
nothing
impossible
in
a
man
escaping
thus
from
the
laws
to
reappear
elsewhere
as
a
dignitary
among
the
priesthood
there
was
something
phantasmagorial
in
these
sudden
disappearances
and
more
than
one
such
flight
has
led
to
events
like
the
marvels
of
a
dream
an
escapade
of
this
kind
indeed
seemed
to
end
naturally
in
the
wild
and
wonderful
as
when
some
broken
bankrupt
suddenly
decamps
to
turn
up
again
twenty
years
later
as
grand
vizier
to
the
mogul
or
as
a
king
in
tasmania
rendering
assistance
to
these
fugitives
was
an
established
trade
and
looking
to
the
abundance
of
business
of
that
kind
was
a
highly
profitable
one
it
was
generally
carried
on
as
a
supplementary
branch
of
certain
recognised
kinds
of
commerce
a
person
for
instance
desiring
to
escape
to
england
applied
to
the
smugglers
one
who
desired
to
get
to
america
had
recourse
to
like
zuela
ii
clubin
observes
someone
zuela
came
sometimes
to
take
refreshment
at
the
jean
auberge
clubin
knew
him
by
sight
for
that
matter
clubin
was
not
proud
he
did
not
disdain
even
to
know
scamps
by
sight
he
went
so
far
sometimes
as
to
cultivate
even
a
closer
acquaintance
with
them
giving
his
hand
in
the
open
street
or
saying
to
them
he
talked
english
with
the
smugglers
and
jabbered
spanish
with
the
on
this
subject
he
had
at
command
a
number
of
apologetic
phrases
good
he
said
can
be
extracted
out
of
the
knowledge
of
evil
the
gamekeeper
may
find
advantage
in
knowing
the
poacher
the
good
pilot
may
sound
the
depths
of
a
pirate
who
is
only
a
sort
of
hidden
rock
i
test
the
quality
of
a
scoundrel
as
a
doctor
will
test
a
poison
there
was
no
answering
a
battery
of
proverbs
like
this
everybody
gave
clubin
credit
for
his
shrewdness
people
praised
him
for
not
indulging
in
a
ridiculous
delicacy
who
then
should
dare
to
speak
scandal
of
him
on
this
point
everything
he
did
was
evidently
for
the
good
of
the
service
with
him
all
was
straightforward
nothing
could
stain
his
good
fame
crystal
might
more
easily
become
sullied
this
general
confidence
in
him
was
the
natural
reward
of
a
long
life
of
integrity
the
crowning
advantage
of
a
settled
reputation
whatever
clubin
might
do
or
appear
to
do
was
sure
to
be
interpreted
favourably
he
had
attained
almost
to
a
state
of
impeccability
over
and
above
this
he
is
very
wary
people
said
and
from
a
situation
which
in
others
would
have
given
rise
to
suspicion
his
integrity
would
extricate
itself
with
a
still
greater
halo
of
reputation
for
ability
this
reputation
for
ability
mingled
harmoniously
with
his
fame
for
perfect
simplicity
of
character
great
simplicity
and
great
talents
in
conjunction
are
not
uncommon
the
compound
constitutes
one
of
the
varieties
of
the
virtuous
man
and
one
of
the
most
valuable
sieur
clubin
was
one
of
those
men
who
might
be
found
in
intimate
conversation
with
a
sharper
or
a
thief
without
suffering
any
diminution
of
respect
in
the
minds
of
their
neighbours
the
had
completed
her
loading
she
was
ready
for
sea
and
was
preparing
to
sail
very
shortly
one
tuesday
evening
the
durande
arrived
at
malo
while
it
was
still
broad
daylight
sieur
clubin
standing
upon
the
bridge
of
the
vessel
and
superintending
the
manoeuvres
necessary
for
getting
her
into
port
perceived
upon
the
sandy
beach
near
the
two
men
who
were
conversing
between
the
rocks
in
a
solitary
spot
he
observed
them
with
his
and
recognised
one
of
the
men
it
was
captain
zuela
he
seemed
to
recognise
the
other
also
this
other
was
a
person
of
high
stature
a
little
grey
he
wore
the
hat
and
the
sober
clothing
of
the
society
of
friends
he
was
probably
a
quaker
he
lowered
his
gaze
with
an
air
of
extreme
diffidence
on
arriving
at
the
jean
auberge
sieur
clubin
learnt
that
the
was
preparing
to
sail
in
about
ten
days
it
has
since
become
known
that
he
obtained
information
on
some
other
points
that
night
he
entered
the
gunsmith
shop
in
the
vincent
street
and
said
to
the
master
do
you
know
what
a
revolver
is
yes
replied
the
gunsmith
it
is
an
american
weapon
it
is
a
pistol
with
which
a
man
can
carry
on
a
conversation
exactly
an
instrument
which
comprises
in
itself
both
the
question
and
the
answer
and
the
rejoinder
too
precisely
monsieur
clubin
a
rotatory
clump
of
barrels
i
shall
want
five
or
six
balls
the
gunmaker
twisted
the
corner
of
his
lip
and
made
that
peculiar
noise
with
which
when
accompanied
by
a
toss
of
the
head
frenchmen
express
admiration
the
weapon
is
a
good
one
monsieur
clubin
i
want
a
revolver
with
six
barrels
i
have
not
one
what
and
you
a
gunmaker
i
do
not
keep
such
articles
yet
you
see
it
is
a
new
thing
it
is
only
just
coming
into
vogue
french
makers
as
yet
confine
themselves
to
the
simple
pistol
nonsense
it
has
not
yet
become
an
article
of
commerce
nonsense
i
say
i
have
excellent
pistols
i
want
a
revolver
i
agree
that
it
is
more
useful
stop
monsieur
clubin
what
i
believe
i
know
where
there
is
one
at
this
moment
in
malo
to
be
had
a
bargain
a
revolver
yes
for
sale
yes
where
is
that
i
believe
i
know
or
i
can
find
out
when
can
you
give
me
an
answer
a
bargain
but
of
good
quality
when
shall
i
return
if
i
procure
you
a
revolver
remember
it
will
be
a
good
one
when
will
you
give
me
an
answer
after
your
next
voyage
do
not
mention
that
it
is
for
me
said
clubin
iii
clubin
carries
away
something
and
brings
back
nothing
sieur
clubin
completed
the
loading
of
the
durande
embarked
a
number
of
cattle
and
some
passengers
and
left
malo
for
guernsey
as
usual
on
the
friday
morning
on
that
same
friday
when
the
vessel
had
gained
the
open
which
permits
the
captain
to
absent
himself
a
moment
from
the
place
of
command
clubin
entered
his
cabin
shut
himself
in
took
a
travelling
bag
which
he
kept
there
put
into
one
of
its
compartments
some
biscuit
some
boxes
of
preserves
a
few
pounds
of
chocolate
in
sticks
a
chronometer
and
a
sea
telescope
and
passed
through
the
handles
a
cord
ready
prepared
to
sling
it
if
necessary
then
he
descended
into
the
hold
went
into
the
compartment
where
the
cables
are
kept
and
was
seen
to
come
up
again
with
one
of
those
knotted
ropes
heavy
with
pieces
of
metal
which
are
used
for
ship
caulkers
at
sea
and
by
robbers
ashore
cords
of
this
kind
are
useful
in
climbing
having
arrived
at
guernsey
clubin
repaired
to
torteval
he
took
with
him
the
travelling
bag
and
the
knotted
cord
but
did
not
bring
them
back
again
let
us
repeat
once
for
all
the
guernsey
which
we
are
describing
is
that
ancient
guernsey
which
no
longer
exists
and
of
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
a
parallel
now
anywhere
except
in
the
country
there
it
is
still
flourishing
but
in
the
towns
it
has
passed
away
the
same
remarks
apply
to
jersey
helier
is
as
civilised
as
dieppe
peter
port
as
thanks
to
the
progress
of
civilisation
thanks
to
the
admirably
enterprising
spirit
of
that
brave
island
people
everything
has
been
changed
during
the
last
forty
years
in
the
norman
archipelago
where
there
was
darkness
there
is
now
light
with
these
premises
let
us
proceed
at
that
period
then
which
is
already
so
far
removed
from
us
as
to
have
become
historical
smuggling
was
carried
on
very
extensively
in
the
channel
the
smuggling
vessels
abounded
particularly
on
the
western
coast
of
guernsey
people
of
that
peculiarly
clever
kind
who
know
even
in
the
smallest
details
what
went
on
half
a
century
ago
will
even
cite
you
the
names
of
these
suspicious
craft
which
were
almost
always
austrians
or
guiposeans
it
is
certain
that
a
week
scarcely
ever
passed
without
one
or
two
being
seen
either
in
saint
bay
or
at
pleinmont
their
coming
and
going
had
almost
the
character
of
a
regular
service
a
cavern
in
the
cliffs
at
sark
was
called
then
and
is
still
called
the
shops
les
boutiques
from
its
being
the
place
where
these
smugglers
made
their
bargains
with
the
purchasers
of
their
merchandise
this
sort
of
traffic
had
in
the
channel
a
dialect
of
its
own
a
vocabulary
of
contraband
technicalities
now
forgotten
and
which
was
to
the
spanish
what
the
levantine
is
to
the
italian
on
many
parts
of
the
english
coast
smuggling
had
a
secret
but
cordial
understanding
with
legitimate
and
open
commerce
it
had
access
to
the
house
of
more
than
one
great
financier
by
the
it
is
true
and
its
influence
extended
itself
mysteriously
through
all
the
commercial
world
and
the
intricate
ramifications
of
manufacturing
industry
merchant
on
one
side
smuggler
on
the
other
such
was
the
key
to
the
secret
of
many
great
fortunes
séguin
affirmed
it
of
bourgain
bourgain
of
séguin
we
do
not
vouch
for
their
accusations
it
is
possible
that
they
were
calumniating
each
other
however
this
may
have
been
it
is
certain
that
the
contraband
trade
though
hunted
down
by
the
law
was
flourishing
enough
in
certain
financial
circles
it
had
relations
with
the
very
best
society
thus
the
brigand
mandrin
in
other
days
found
himself
occasionally
with
the
count
of
charolais
for
this
underhand
trade
often
contrived
to
put
on
a
very
respectable
appearance
kept
a
house
of
its
own
with
an
irreproachable
exterior
all
this
necessitated
a
host
of
manoeuvres
and
connivances
which
required
impenetrable
secrecy
a
contrabandist
was
entrusted
with
a
good
many
things
and
knew
how
to
keep
them
secret
an
inviolable
confidence
was
the
condition
of
his
existence
the
first
quality
in
fact
in
a
smuggler
was
strict
honour
in
his
own
circle
no
discreetness
no
smuggling
fraud
has
its
secrets
like
the
priest
confessional
these
secrets
were
indeed
as
a
rule
faithfully
kept
the
contrabandist
swore
to
betray
nothing
and
he
kept
his
word
nobody
was
more
trustworthy
than
the
genuine
smuggler
the
judge
alcade
of
oyarzun
captured
a
smuggler
one
day
and
put
him
to
torture
to
compel
him
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
capitalist
who
secretly
supported
him
the
smuggler
refused
to
tell
the
capitalist
in
question
was
the
judge
alcade
himself
of
these
two
accomplices
the
judge
and
the
smuggler
the
one
had
been
compelled
in
order
to
appear
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
to
fulfil
the
law
to
put
the
other
to
the
torture
which
the
other
had
patiently
borne
for
the
sake
of
his
oath
the
two
most
famous
smugglers
who
haunted
pleinmont
at
that
period
were
blasco
and
blasquito
they
were
this
was
a
sort
of
spanish
or
catholic
relationship
which
consisted
in
having
the
same
patron
saint
in
heaven
a
thing
it
will
be
admitted
not
less
worthy
of
consideration
than
having
the
same
father
upon
earth
when
a
person
was
initiated
into
the
furtive
ways
of
the
contraband
business
nothing
was
more
easy
or
from
a
certain
point
of
view
more
troublesome
it
was
sufficient
to
have
no
fear
of
dark
nights
to
repair
to
pleinmont
and
to
consult
the
oracle
located
there
iv
pleinmont
pleinmont
near
torteval
is
one
of
the
three
corners
of
the
island
of
guernsey
at
the
extremity
of
the
cape
there
rises
a
high
turfy
hill
which
looks
over
the
sea
the
height
is
a
lonely
place
all
the
more
lonely
from
there
being
one
solitary
house
there
this
house
adds
a
sense
of
terror
to
that
of
solitude
it
is
popularly
believed
to
be
haunted
haunted
or
not
its
aspect
is
singular
built
of
granite
and
rising
only
one
story
high
it
stands
in
the
midst
of
the
grassy
solitude
it
is
in
a
perfectly
good
condition
as
far
as
exterior
is
concerned
the
walls
are
thick
and
the
roof
is
sound
not
a
stone
is
wanting
in
the
sides
not
a
tile
upon
the
roof
a
forms
the
angle
of
the
roof
the
building
turns
its
back
to
the
sea
being
on
that
side
merely
a
blank
wall
on
examining
this
wall
however
attentively
the
visitor
perceives
a
little
window
bricked
up
the
two
gables
have
three
dormer
windows
one
fronting
the
east
the
others
fronting
the
west
but
both
are
bricked
up
in
like
manner
the
front
which
looks
inland
has
alone
a
door
and
windows
this
door
too
is
walled
in
as
are
also
the
two
windows
of
the
on
the
first
floor
and
this
is
the
feature
which
is
most
striking
as
you
approach
there
are
two
open
windows
but
these
are
even
more
suspicious
than
the
blind
windows
their
open
squares
look
dark
even
in
broad
day
for
they
have
no
panes
of
glass
or
even
they
open
simply
upon
the
dusk
within
they
strike
the
imagination
like
hollow
in
a
human
face
inside
all
is
deserted
through
the
gaping
casements
you
may
mark
the
ruin
within
no
panellings
no
woodwork
all
bare
stone
it
is
like
a
windowed
sepulchre
giving
liberty
to
the
spectres
to
look
out
upon
the
daylight
world
the
rains
sap
the
foundations
on
the
seaward
side
a
few
nettles
shaken
by
the
breeze
flourish
in
the
lower
part
of
the
walls
far
around
the
horizon
there
is
no
other
human
habitation
the
house
is
a
void
the
abode
of
silence
but
if
you
place
your
ear
against
the
wall
and
listen
you
may
distinguish
a
confused
noise
now
and
then
like
the
flutter
of
wings
over
the
walled
door
upon
the
stone
which
forms
its
architrave
are
sculptured
these
letters
with
the
date
the
dark
shadow
of
night
and
the
mournful
light
of
the
moon
find
entrance
there
the
sea
completely
surrounds
the
house
its
situation
is
magnificent
but
for
that
reason
its
aspect
is
more
sinister
the
beauty
of
the
spot
becomes
a
puzzle
why
does
not
a
human
family
take
up
its
abode
here
the
place
is
beautiful
the
house
whence
this
neglect
to
these
questions
obvious
to
the
reason
succeed
others
suggested
by
the
reverie
which
the
place
inspires
why
is
this
cultivatable
garden
uncultivated
no
master
for
it
and
the
doorway
what
has
happened
to
the
place
why
is
it
shunned
by
men
what
business
is
done
here
if
none
why
is
there
no
one
here
is
it
only
when
all
the
rest
of
the
world
are
asleep
that
some
one
in
this
spot
is
awake
dark
squalls
wild
winds
birds
of
prey
strange
creatures
unknown
forms
present
themselves
to
the
mind
and
connect
themselves
somehow
with
this
deserted
house
for
what
class
of
wayfarers
can
this
be
the
hostelry
you
imagine
to
yourself
whirlwinds
of
rain
and
hail
beating
in
at
the
open
casements
and
wandering
through
the
rooms
tempests
have
left
their
vague
traces
upon
the
interior
walls
the
chambers
though
walled
and
covered
in
are
visited
by
the
hurricanes
has
the
house
been
the
scene
of
some
great
crime
you
may
almost
fancy
that
this
spectral
dwelling
given
up
to
solitude
and
darkness
might
be
heard
calling
aloud
for
succour
does
it
remain
silent
do
voices
indeed
issue
from
it
what
business
has
it
on
hand
in
this
lonely
place
the
mystery
of
the
dark
hours
rests
securely
here
its
aspect
is
disquieting
at
noonday
what
must
it
be
at
midnight
the
dreamer
asks
himself
for
dreams
have
their
coherence
what
this
house
may
be
between
the
dusk
of
evening
and
the
twilight
of
approaching
dawn
has
the
vast
supernatural
world
some
relation
with
this
deserted
height
which
sometimes
compels
it
to
arrest
its
movements
here
and
to
descend
and
to
become
visible
do
the
scattered
elements
of
the
spirit
world
whirl
around
it
does
the
impalpable
take
form
and
substance
here
insoluble
riddles
a
holy
awe
is
in
the
very
stones
that
dim
twilight
has
surely
relations
with
the
infinite
unknown
when
the
sun
has
gone
down
the
song
of
the
birds
will
be
hushed
the
goatherd
behind
the
hills
will
go
homeward
with
his
goats
reptiles
taking
courage
from
the
gathering
darkness
will
creep
through
the
fissures
of
rocks
the
stars
will
begin
to
appear
night
will
come
but
yonder
two
blank
casements
will
still
be
staring
at
the
sky
they
open
to
welcome
spirits
and
apparitions
for
it
is
by
the
names
of
apparitions
ghosts
phantom
faces
vaguely
distinct
masks
in
the
lurid
light
mysterious
movements
of
minds
and
shadows
that
the
popular
faith
at
once
ignorant
and
profound
translates
the
sombre
relations
of
this
dwelling
with
the
world
of
darkness
the
house
is
haunted
the
popular
phrase
comprises
everything
credulous
minds
have
their
explanation
thinkers
have
theirs
also
nothing
is
more
simple
say
the
latter
than
the
history
of
the
house
it
is
an
old
observatory
of
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
wars
and
the
days
of
smuggling
it
was
built
for
such
objects
the
wars
being
ended
the
house
was
abandoned
but
it
was
not
pulled
down
as
it
might
one
day
again
become
useful
the
door
and
windows
have
been
walled
to
prevent
people
entering
or
doing
injury
to
the
interior
the
walls
of
the
windows
on
the
three
sides
which
face
the
sea
have
been
bricked
up
against
the
winds
of
the
south
and
that
is
all
the
ignorant
and
the
credulous
however
are
not
satisfied
in
the
first
place
the
house
was
not
built
at
the
period
of
the
wars
of
the
revolution
it
bears
the
date
which
was
anterior
to
the
revolution
in
the
next
place
it
was
not
built
for
an
observatory
it
bears
the
letters
which
are
the
double
monogram
of
two
families
and
which
indicate
according
to
usage
that
the
house
was
built
for
the
use
of
a
couple
then
it
has
certainly
been
inhabited
why
then
should
it
be
abandoned
if
the
door
and
windows
were
bricked
up
to
prevent
people
entering
the
house
only
why
were
two
windows
left
open
why
are
there
no
shutters
no
no
glass
why
were
the
walls
bricked
in
on
one
side
if
not
on
the
other
the
wind
is
prevented
from
entering
from
the
south
but
why
is
it
allowed
to
enter
from
the
north
the
credulous
are
wrong
no
doubt
but
it
is
clear
that
the
thinkers
have
not
discovered
the
key
to
the
mystery
the
problem
remains
still
unsolved
it
is
certain
that
the
house
is
generally
believed
to
have
been
more
useful
than
inconvenient
to
the
smugglers
the
growth
of
superstitious
terror
tends
to
deprive
facts
of
their
true
proportions
without
doubt
many
of
the
nocturnal
phenomena
which
have
by
little
and
little
secured
to
the
building
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
might
be
explained
by
obscure
and
furtive
visits
by
brief
sojourns
of
sailors
near
the
spot
and
sometimes
by
the
precaution
sometimes
by
the
daring
of
men
engaged
in
certain
suspicious
occupations
concealing
themselves
for
their
dark
purposes
or
allowing
themselves
to
be
seen
in
order
to
inspire
dread
at
this
period
already
a
remote
one
many
daring
deeds
were
possible
the
police
particularly
in
small
places
was
by
no
means
as
efficient
as
in
these
days
add
to
this
that
if
the
house
was
really
as
was
said
a
resort
of
the
smugglers
their
meetings
there
must
up
to
a
certain
point
have
been
safe
from
interruptions
precisely
because
the
house
was
dreaded
by
the
superstitious
people
of
the
country
its
ghostly
reputation
prevented
its
being
visited
for
other
reasons
people
do
not
generally
apply
to
the
police
or
officers
of
customs
on
the
subject
of
spectres
the
superstitious
rely
on
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
not
on
magistrates
and
indictments
there
is
always
a
tacit
connivance
involuntary
it
may
be
but
not
the
less
real
between
the
objects
which
inspire
fear
and
their
victims
the
feel
a
sort
of
culpability
in
having
encountered
their
terrors
they
imagine
themselves
to
have
unveiled
a
secret
and
they
have
an
inward
fear
unknown
even
to
themselves
of
aggravating
their
guilt
and
exciting
the
anger
of
the
apparitions
all
this
makes
them
discreet
and
over
and
above
this
reason
the
very
instinct
of
the
credulous
is
silence
dread
is
akin
to
dumbness
the
terrified
speak
little
horror
seems
always
to
whisper
hush
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
was
a
period
when
the
guernsey
peasants
believed
that
the
mystery
of
the
holy
manger
is
repeated
by
oxen
and
asses
every
year
on
a
fixed
day
a
period
when
no
one
would
have
dared
to
enter
a
stable
at
night
for
fear
of
coming
upon
the
animals
on
their
knees
if
the
local
legends
and
stories
of
the
people
can
be
credited
the
popular
superstition
went
so
far
as
to
fasten
to
the
walls
of
the
house
at
pleinmont
things
of
which
the
traces
are
still
visible
rats
without
feet
bats
without
wings
and
bodies
of
other
dead
animals
here
too
were
seen
toads
crushed
between
the
pages
of
a
bible
bunches
of
yellow
lupins
and
other
strange
offerings
placed
there
by
imprudent
at
night
who
having
fancied
that
they
had
seen
something
hoped
by
these
small
sacrifices
to
obtain
pardon
and
to
appease
the
of
and
evil
spirits
in
all
times
believers
of
this
kind
have
flourished
some
even
in
very
high
places
cæsar
consulted
saganius
and
napoleon
mademoiselle
lenormand
there
are
a
kind
of
consciences
so
tender
that
they
must
seek
indulgences
even
from
beelzebub
may
god
do
and
satan
not
undo
was
one
of
the
prayers
of
charles
the
fifth
they
come
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
may
commit
sins
even
against
the
evil
one
and
one
of
their
cherished
objects
was
to
be
irreproachable
even
in
the
eyes
of
satan
we
find
here
an
explanation
of
those
adorations
sometimes
paid
to
infernal
spirits
it
is
only
one
more
species
of
fanaticism
sins
against
the
devil
certainly
exist
in
certain
morbid
imaginations
the
fancy
that
they
have
violated
the
laws
of
the
lower
regions
torments
certain
eccentric
casuists
they
are
haunted
with
scruples
even
about
offending
the
demons
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
devotions
to
the
spirits
of
the
brocken
or
armuyr
a
notion
of
having
committed
sins
against
hell
visionary
penances
for
imaginary
crimes
avowals
of
the
truth
to
the
spirit
of
falsehood
before
the
origin
of
all
evil
and
confessions
in
an
inverted
sense
are
all
realities
or
things
at
least
which
have
existed
the
annals
of
criminal
procedure
against
witchcraft
and
magic
prove
this
in
every
page
human
folly
unhappily
extends
even
thus
far
when
terror
seizes
upon
a
man
he
does
not
stop
easily
he
dreams
of
imaginary
faults
imaginary
purifications
and
clears
out
his
conscience
with
the
old
witches
broom
be
this
as
it
may
if
the
house
at
pleinmont
had
its
secrets
it
kept
them
to
itself
except
by
some
rare
chance
no
one
went
there
to
see
it
was
left
entirely
alone
few
people
indeed
like
to
run
the
risk
of
an
encounter
with
the
other
world
owing
to
the
terror
which
it
inspired
and
which
kept
at
a
distance
all
who
could
observe
or
bear
testimony
on
the
subject
it
had
always
been
easy
to
obtain
an
entrance
there
at
night
by
means
of
a
rope
ladder
or
even
by
the
use
of
the
first
ladder
coming
to
hand
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
fields
a
consignment
of
goods
or
provisions
left
there
might
await
in
perfect
safety
the
time
and
opportunity
for
a
furtive
embarkation
tradition
relates
that
forty
years
ago
a
fugitive
for
political
offences
as
some
affirm
for
commercial
as
others
say
remained
for
some
time
concealed
in
the
haunted
house
at
pleinmont
whence
he
finally
succeeded
in
embarking
in
a
for
england
from
england
a
passage
is
easily
obtained
to
america
tradition
also
avers
that
provisions
deposited
in
this
house
remain
there
untouched
lucifer
and
the
smugglers
having
an
interest
in
inducing
whoever
places
them
there
to
return
from
the
summit
of
the
house
there
is
a
view
to
the
south
of
the
hanway
rocks
at
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
these
rocks
are
famous
they
have
been
guilty
of
all
the
evil
deeds
of
which
rocks
are
capable
they
are
the
most
ruthless
destroyers
of
the
sea
they
lie
in
a
treacherous
ambush
for
vessels
in
the
night
they
have
contributed
to
the
enlargement
of
the
cemeteries
at
torteval
and
rocquaine
a
lighthouse
was
erected
upon
these
rocks
in
at
the
present
day
the
hanways
light
the
way
for
the
vessels
which
they
once
lured
to
destruction
the
destroyer
in
ambush
now
bears
a
lighted
torch
in
his
hand
and
mariners
seek
in
the
horizon
as
a
protector
and
a
guide
the
rock
which
they
used
to
fly
as
a
pitiless
enemy
it
gives
confidence
by
night
in
that
vast
space
where
it
was
so
long
a
terror
like
a
robber
converted
into
a
gendarme
there
are
three
hanways
the
great
hanway
the
little
hanway
and
the
mauve
it
is
upon
the
little
hanway
that
the
red

is
placed

this
reef
of
rocks
forms
part
of
a
group
of
peaks
some
beneath
the
sea
some
rising
out
of
it
it
towers
above
them
all
like
a
fortress
it
has
advanced
works
on
the
side
of
the
open
sea
a
chain
of
thirteen
rocks
on
the
north
two
breakers
the
high
fourquiés
the
needles
and
a
sandbank
called
the
hérouée
on
the
south
three
rocks
the
cat
rock
the
percée
and
the
herpin
rock
then
two
banks
the
south
bank
and
the
muet
besides
which
there
is
on
the
side
opposite
pleinmont
the
tas
de
pois
to
swim
across
the
channel
from
the
hanways
to
pleinmont
is
difficult
but
not
impossible
we
have
already
said
that
this
was
one
of
the
achievements
of
clubin
the
expert
swimmer
who
knows
this
channel
can
find
two
the
round
rock
and
further
on
a
little
out
of
the
course
to
the
left
the
red
rock
v
the
it
was
near
the
period
of
that
saturday
which
was
passed
by
sieur
clubin
at
torteval
that
a
curious
incident
occurred
which
was
little
heard
of
at
the
time
and
which
did
not
generally
transpire
till
a
long
time
afterwards
for
many
things
as
we
have
already
observed
remain
undivulged
simply
by
reason
of
the
terror
which
they
have
caused
in
those
who
have
witnessed
them
in
the
between
saturday
and
sunday
we
are
exact
in
the
matter
of
the
date
and
we
believe
it
to
be
correct
three
boys
climbed
up
the
hill
at
pleinmont
the
boys
returned
to
the
village
they
came
from
the
seashore
they
were
what
are
called
in
the
corrupt
french
of
that
part
déniquoiseaux
or
wherever
there
are
cliffs
and
overhanging
the
sea
the
young
abound
the
reader
will
remember
that
gilliatt
interfered
in
this
matter
for
the
sake
of
the
birds
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
the
children
the
déniquoiseaux
are
a
sort
of
and
are
not
a
very
timid
species
the
night
was
very
dark
dense
masses
of
cloud
obscured
the
zenith
three
had
sounded
in
the
steeple
of
torteval
which
is
round
and
pointed
like
a
magician
hat
why
did
the
boys
return
so
late
nothing
more
simple
they
had
been
searching
for
nests
in
the
tas
de
pois
the
season
having
been
very
mild
the
pairing
of
the
birds
had
begun
very
early
the
children
watching
the
fluttering
of
the
male
and
female
about
their
nests
and
excited
by
the
pursuit
had
forgotten
the
time
the
waters
had
crept
up
around
them
they
had
no
time
to
regain
the
little
bay
in
which
they
had
moored
their
boat
and
they
were
compelled
to
wait
upon
one
of
the
peaks
of
the
tas
de
pois
for
the
ebb
of
the
tide
hence
their
late
return
mothers
wait
on
such
occasions
in
feverish
anxiety
for
the
return
of
their
children
and
when
they
find
them
safe
give
vent
to
their
joy
in
the
shape
of
anger
and
relieve
their
tears
by
dealing
them
a
sound
drubbing
the
boys
accordingly
hastened
their
steps
but
in
fear
and
trembling
their
haste
was
of
that
sort
which
is
glad
of
an
excuse
for
stopping
and
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
a
reluctance
to
reach
their
destination
for
they
had
before
them
the
prospect
of
warm
embraces
to
be
followed
with
an
inevitable
thrashing
one
only
of
the
boys
had
nothing
of
this
to
fear
he
was
an
orphan
a
french
boy
without
father
or
mother
and
perfectly
content
just
then
with
his
motherless
condition
for
nobody
taking
any
interest
in
him
his
back
was
safe
from
the
dreaded
blows
the
two
others
were
natives
of
guernsey
and
belonged
to
the
parish
of
torteval
having
climbed
the
grassy
hill
the
three
reached
the
tableland
on
which
was
situate
the
haunted
house
they
began
by
being
in
fear
which
is
the
proper
frame
of
mind
of
every
and
particularly
of
every
child
at
that
hour
and
in
that
place
they
had
a
strong
desire
to
take
to
their
heels
as
fast
as
possible
and
a
strong
desire
also
to
stay
and
look
they
did
stop
they
looked
towards
the
solitary
building
it
was
all
dark
and
terrible
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
solitary
plain
an
obscure
block
a
hideous
but
symmetrical
excrescence
a
high
square
mass
with
corners
like
an
immense
altar
in
the
darkness
the
first
thought
of
the
boys
was
to
run
the
second
was
to
draw
nearer
they
had
never
seen
this
house
before
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
desire
to
be
frightened
arising
from
curiosity
they
had
a
little
french
boy
with
them
which
emboldened
them
to
approach
it
is
well
known
that
the
french
have
no
fear
besides
it
is
reassuring
to
have
company
in
danger
to
be
frightened
in
the
company
of
two
others
is
encouraging
and
then
they
were
a
sort
of
hunters
accustomed
to
peril
they
were
children
they
were
used
to
search
to
rummage
to
spy
out
hidden
things
they
were
in
the
habit
of
peeping
into
holes
why
not
into
this
hole
hunting
is
exciting
looking
into
birds
nests
perhaps
gives
an
itch
for
looking
a
little
into
a
nest
of
ghosts
a
rummage
in
the
dark
regions
why
not
from
prey
to
prey
says
the
proverb
we
come
to
the
devil
after
the
birds
the
demons
the
boys
were
on
the
way
to
learn
the
secret
of
those
terrors
of
which
their
parents
had
told
them
to
be
on
the
track
of
hobgoblin
tales
nothing
could
be
more
attractive
to
have
long
stories
to
tell
like
the
good
housewives
the
notion
was
tempting
all
this
mixture
of
ideas
in
their
state
of
in
the
minds
of
the
guernsey
finally
screwed
their
courage
to
the
point
they
approached
the
house
the
little
fellow
who
served
them
as
a
sort
of
moral
support
in
the
adventure
was
certainly
worthy
of
their
confidence
he
was
a
bold
boy
an
apprentice
to
a
one
of
those
children
who
have
already
become
men
he
slept
on
a
little
straw
in
a
shed
in
the
yard
getting
his
own
living
having
red
hair
and
a
loud
voice
climbing
easily
up
walls
and
trees
not
encumbered
with
prejudices
in
the
matter
of
property
in
the
apples
within
his
reach
a
lad
who
had
worked
in
the
repairing
dock
for
vessels
of
war
a
child
of
chance
a
happy
orphan
born
in
france
no
one
knew
exactly
where
ready
to
give
a
centime
to
a
beggar
a
mischievous
fellow
but
a
good
one
at
heart
one
who
had
talked
to
parisians
at
this
time
he
was
earning
a
shilling
a
day
by
caulking
the
fishermen
boats
under
repair
at
the
pêqueries
when
he
felt
inclined
he
gave
himself
a
holiday
and
went
such
was
the
little
french
boy
the
solitude
of
the
place
impressed
them
with
a
strange
feeling
of
dread
they
felt
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
silent
house
it
was
wild
and
savage
the
naked
and
deserted
plateau
terminated
in
a
precipice
at
a
short
distance
from
its
steep
incline
the
sea
below
was
quiet
there
was
no
wind
not
a
blade
of
grass
stirred
the
advanced
by
slow
steps
the
french
boy
at
their
head
and
looking
towards
the
house
one
of
them
afterwards
relating
the
story
or
as
much
of
it
as
had
remained
in
his
head
added
it
did
not
speak
they
came
nearer
holding
their
breath
as
one
might
approach
a
savage
animal
they
had
climbed
the
hill
at
the
side
of
the
house
which
descended
to
seaward
towards
a
little
isthmus
of
rocks
almost
inaccessible
thus
they
had
come
pretty
near
to
the
building
but
they
saw
only
the
southern
side
which
was
all
walled
up
they
did
not
dare
to
approach
by
the
other
side
where
the
terrible
windows
were
they
grew
bolder
however
the
caulker
apprentice
whispered
veer
to
larboard
that
the
handsome
side
let
have
a
look
at
the
black
windows
the
little
band
accordingly
veered
to
larboard
and
came
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
the
two
windows
were
lighted
up
the
boys
took
to
their
heels
when
they
had
got
to
some
distance
the
french
boy
however
returned
hillo
said
he
the
lights
have
vanished
the
light
at
the
windows
had
indeed
disappeared
the
outline
of
the
building
was
seen
as
sharply
defined
as
if
stamped
out
with
a
punch
against
the
livid
sky
their
fear
was
not
abated
but
their
curiosity
had
increased
the
approached
suddenly
the
light
reappeared
at
both
windows
at
the
same
moment
the
two
young
urchins
from
torteval
took
to
their
heels
and
vanished
the
daring
french
boy
did
not
advance
but
he
kept
his
ground
he
remained
motionless
confronting
the
house
and
watching
it
the
light
disappeared
and
appeared
again
once
more
nothing
could
be
more
horrible
the
reflection
made
a
vague
streak
of
light
upon
the
grass
wet
with
the
night
dew
all
of
a
moment
the
light
cast
upon
the
walls
of
the
house
two
huge
dark
profiles
and
the
shadows
of
enormous
heads
the
house
however
being
without
ceilings
and
having
nothing
left
but
its
four
walls
and
roof
one
window
could
not
be
lighted
without
the
other
perceiving
that
the
caulker
apprentice
kept
his
ground
the
other
returned
step
by
step
and
one
after
the
other
trembling
and
curious
the
caulker
apprentice
whispered
to
them
there
are
ghosts
in
the
house
i
have
seen
the
nose
of
one
the
two
torteval
boys
got
behind
their
companion
standing
tiptoe
against
his
shoulder
and
thus
sheltered
and
taking
him
for
their
shield
felt
bolder
and
watched
also
the
house
on
its
part
seemed
also
to
be
watching
them
there
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
that
vast
darkness
and
silence
with
its
two
glaring
eyes
these
were
its
upper
windows
the
light
vanished
reappeared
and
vanished
again
in
the
fashion
of
these
unearthly
illuminations
these
sinister
intermissions
had
probably
some
connection
with
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
infernal
regions
the
of
a
sepulchre
has
thus
been
seen
to
produce
effects
like
those
from
a
dark
lantern
suddenly
a
dark
form
like
that
of
a
human
being
ascended
to
one
of
the
windows
as
if
from
without
and
plunged
into
the
interior
of
the
house
to
enter
by
the
window
is
the
custom
with
spirits
the
light
was
for
a
moment
more
brilliant
then
went
out
and
appeared
no
more
the
house
became
dark
the
noises
resembled
voices
this
is
always
the
case
when
there
was
anything
to
be
seen
it
is
silent
when
all
became
invisible
again
noises
were
heard
there
is
a
silence
peculiar
to
at
sea
the
repose
of
darkness
is
deeper
on
the
water
than
on
the
land
when
there
is
neither
wind
nor
wave
in
that
wild
expanse
over
which
in
ordinary
time
even
the
flight
of
eagles
makes
no
sound
the
movement
of
a
fly
could
be
heard
this
sepulchral
quiet
gave
a
dismal
relief
to
the
noises
which
issued
from
the
house
let
us
look
said
the
french
boy
and
he
made
a
step
towards
the
house
the
others
were
so
frightened
that
they
resolved
to
follow
him
they
did
not
dare
even
to
run
away
alone
just
as
they
had
passed
a
heap
of
fagots
which
for
some
mysterious
reason
seemed
to
inspire
them
with
a
little
courage
in
that
solitude
a
white
owl
flew
towards
them
from
a
bush
the
owls
have
a
suspicious
sort
of
flight
a
sidelong
skim
which
is
suggestive
of
mischief
afloat
the
bird
passed
near
the
boys
fixing
upon
them
its
round
eyes
bright
amidst
the
darkness
a
shudder
ran
through
the
group
behind
the
french
boy
he
looked
up
at
the
owl
and
said
too
late
my
bird
i
look
and
he
advanced
the
crackling
sound
made
by
his
boots
among
the
furze
bushes
did
not
prevent
his
hearing
the
noise
in
the
house
which
rose
and
fell
with
the
continuousness
and
the
calm
accent
of
a
dialogue
a
moment
afterwards
the
boy
added
besides
it
is
only
fools
who
believe
in
spirits
insolence
in
the
face
of
danger
rallies
the
cowardly
and
inspirits
them
to
go
on
the
two
torteval
lads
resumed
their
march
quickening
their
steps
behind
the
caulker
apprentice
the
haunted
house
seemed
to
them
to
grow
larger
before
their
eyes
this
optical
illusion
of
fear
is
founded
in
reality
the
house
did
indeed
grow
larger
for
they
were
coming
nearer
to
it
meanwhile
the
voices
in
the
house
took
a
tone
more
and
more
distinct
the
children
listened
the
ear
too
has
its
power
of
exaggerating
it
was
different
to
a
murmur
more
than
a
whispering
less
than
an
uproar
now
and
then
one
or
two
words
clearly
articulated
could
be
caught
these
words
impossible
to
be
understood
sounded
strangely
the
boys
stopped
and
listened
then
went
forward
again
it
the
ghosts
talking
said
the
caulker
apprentice
but
i
believe
in
ghosts
the
torteval
boys
were
sorely
tempted
to
shrink
behind
the
heap
of
fagots
but
they
had
already
left
it
far
behind
and
their
friend
the
caulker
continued
to
advance
towards
the
house
they
trembled
at
remaining
with
him
but
they
dared
not
leave
him
step
by
step
and
perplexed
they
followed
the
caulker
apprentice
turned
towards
them
and
said
you
know
it
is
true
there
are
no
such
things
the
house
grew
taller
and
taller
the
voices
became
more
and
more
distinct
they
drew
nearer
and
now
they
could
perceive
within
the
house
something
like
a
muffled
light
it
was
a
faint
glimmer
like
one
of
those
effects
produced
by
dark
lanterns
already
referred
to
and
which
are
common
at
the
midnight
meetings
of
witches
when
they
were
close
to
the
house
they
halted
one
of
the
two
torteval
boys
ventured
on
an
observation
it
is
spirits
it
is
ladies
dressed
in
white
what
that
hanging
from
the
window
asked
the
other
it
looks
like
a
rope
it
a
snake
it
is
only
a
hangman
rope
said
the
french
boy
authoritatively
that
what
they
use
only
i
do
believe
in
them
and
in
three
bounds
rather
than
steps
he
found
himself
against
the
wall
of
the
building
the
two
others
trembling
imitated
him
and
came
pressing
against
him
one
on
his
right
side
the
other
on
his
left
the
boys
applied
their
ears
to
the
wall
the
sounds
continued
the
following
was
the
conversation
of
the
phantoms

it
was
clear
that
only
devils
could
talk
in

the

not

this

to
the

well
and
when
does
the
get
under
way
the
day
after
thursday
replied
the
landlord
on
that
evening
clubin
supped
at
the
officers
table
and
contrary
to
his
habit
went
out
after
his
supper
the
consequence
of
his
absence
was
that
he
could
not
attend
to
the
office
of
the
durande
and
thus
lost
a
little
in
the
matter
of
freights
this
fact
was
remarked
in
a
man
ordinarily
punctual
it
appeared
that
he
had
chatted
a
few
moments
with
his
friend
the
he

after

the
jacressade
forty
years
ago
malo
possessed
an
alley
known
by
the
name
of
the
ruelle
coutanchez
this
alley
no
longer
exists
having
been
removed
for
the
improvements
of
the
town
it
was
a
double
row
of
houses
leaning
one
towards
the
other
and
leaving
between
them
just
room
enough
for
a
narrow
rivulet
which
was
called
the
street
by
stretching
the
legs
it
was
possible
to
walk
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
touching
with
head
or
elbows
as
you
went
the
houses
either
on
the
right
or
the
left
these
old
relics
of
mediæval
normandy
have
almost
a
human
interest
tumbledown
houses
and
sorcerers
always
go
together
their
leaning
stories
their
overhanging
walls
their
bowed
penthouses
and
their
old
irons
seem
like
lips
chin
nose
and
eyebrows
the
garret
window
is
the
blind
eye
the
walls
are
the
wrinkled
and
blotchy
cheeks
the
opposite
houses
lay
their
foreheads
together
as
if
they
were
plotting
some
malicious
deed
all
those
words
of
ancient
villany
like
and
the
like
are
closely
connected
with
architecture
of
this
kind
one
of
these
houses
in
the
alley
the
largest
and
the
most
famous
or
notorious
was
known
by
the
name
of
the
jacressade
the
jacressade
was
a
for
people
who
do
not
lodge
in
all
towns
and
particularly
in
there
is
always
found
beneath
the
lowest
stratum
of
society
a
sort
of
residuum
vagabonds
who
are
more
than
a
match
for
justice
rovers
after
adventures
chemists
of
the
swindling
order
who
are
always
dropping
their
lives
into
the
people
in
rags
of
every
shape
and
in
every
style
of
wearing
them
withered
fruits
of
roguery
bankrupt
existences
consciences
that
have
filed
their
schedule
men
who
have
failed
in
the
trade
for
the
great
masters
of

in
a
higher
sphere
workmen
and
workwomen
in
the
trade
of
wickedness
oddities
male
and

in
coats
out
at

scoundrels
reduced
to

rogues
who
have
missed
the
wages
of
roguery
men
who
have
been
hit
in
the
social
duel
harpies
who
have
no
longer
any
prey
petty
larceners
in
the
double
and
unhappy
meaning
of
that
word
such
are
the
constituents
of
that
living
mass
human
nature
is
here
reduced
to
something
bestial
it
is
the
refuse
of
the
social
state
heaped
up
in
an
obscure
corner
where
from
time
to
time
descends
that
dreaded
broom
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
police
in
malo
the
jacressade
was
the
name
of
this
corner
it
is
not
in
dens
of
this
sort
that
we
find
the
criminals
the
robbers
forgers
and
other
great
products
of
ignorance
and
poverty
if
murder
is
represented
here
it
is
generally
in
the
person
of
some
coarse
drunkard
in
the
matter
of
robbery
the
company
rarely
rise
higher
than
the
mere
sharper
the
vagrant
is
there
but
not
the
highwayman
it
would
not
however
be
safe
to
trust
this
distinction
this
last
stage
of
vagabondage
may
have
its
extremes
of
scoundrelism
it
was
on
an
occasion
when
casting
their
nets
into
the
which
was
in
paris
what
the
jacressade
was
in
malo
that
the
police
captured
the
notorious
lacenaire
these
refuse
nobody
to
fall
in
the
social
scale
has
a
tendency
to
bring
men
to
one
level
sometimes
honesty
in
tatters
found
itself
there
virtue
and
probity
have
been
known
before
now
to
be
brought
to
strange
passes
we
must
not
judge
always
by
appearances
even
in
the
palace
or
at
the
galleys
public
respect
as
well
as
universal
reprobation
requires
testing
surprising
results
sometimes
spring
from
this
principle
an
angel
may
be
discovered
in
the
stews
a
pearl
in
the
dunghill
such
sad
and
dazzling
discoveries
are
not
altogether
unknown
the
jacressade
was
rather
a
courtyard
than
a
house
and
more
of
a
well
than
a
courtyard
it
had
no
stories
looking
on
the
street
its
façade
was
simply
a
high
wall
with
a
low
gateway
you
raised
the
latch
pushed
the
gate
and
were
at
once
in
the
courtyard
in
the
midst
of
this
yard
might
be
perceived
a
round
hole
encircled
with
a
margin
of
stones
and
even
with
the
ground
the
yard
was
small
the
well
large
a
broken
pavement
surrounded
it
the
courtyard
was
square
and
built
on
three
sides
only
on
the
side
of
the
street
was
only
the
wall
facing
you
as
you
entered
the
gateway
stood
the
house
the
two
wings
of
which
formed
the
sides
to
right
and
left
any
one
entering
there
after
nightfall
at
his
own
risk
and
peril
would
have
heard
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
and
if
there
had
been
moonlight
or
starlight
enough
to
give
shape
to
the
obscure
forms
before
his
eyes
this
is
what
he
would
have
seen
the
courtyard
the
well
around
the
courtyard
in
front
of
the
gate
a
or
shed
in
a
sort
of
form
but
with
square
corners
a
rotten
gallery
with
a
roof
of
joists
supported
by
stone
pillars
at
unequal
distances
in
the
centre
the
well
around
the
well
upon
a
litter
of
straw
a
kind
of
circular
chaplet
formed
of
the
soles
of
boots
and
shoes
some
trodden
down
at
heel
some
showing
the
toes
of
the
wearers
some
the
naked
heels
the
feet
of
men
women
and
children
all
asleep
beyond
these
feet
the
eye
might
have
distinguished
in
the
shadow
of
the
shed
bodies
drooping
heads
forms
stretched
out
lazily
bundles
of
rags
of
both
sexes
a
promiscuous
assemblage
a
strange
and
revolting
mass
of
life
the
accommodation
of
this
sleeping
chamber
was
open
to
all
at
the
rate
of
two
sous
a
week
on
a
stormy
night
the
rain
fell
upon
the
feet
the
whirling
snow
settled
on
the
bodies
of
those
wretched
sleepers
who
were
these
people
the
unknown
they
came
there
at
night
and
departed
in
the
morning
creatures
of
this
kind
form
part
of
the
social
fabric
some
stole
in
during
the
darkness
and
paid
nothing
the
greater
part
had
scarcely
eaten
during
the
day
all
kinds
of
vice
and
baseness
every
sort
of
moral
infection
every
species
of
distress
were
there
the
same
sleep
settled
down
upon
all
in
this
bed
of
filth
the
dreams
of
all
these
companions
in
misery
went
on
side
by
side
a
dismal
where
misery
and
weakness
debauchery
weariness
from
long
walking
to
and
fro
with
evil
thoughts
in
quest
of
bread
pallor
with
closed
eyelids
remorse
envy
lay
mingled
and
festering
in
the
same
miasma
with
faces
that
had
the
look
of
death
and
dishevelled
hair
mixed
with
the
filth
and
sweepings
of
the
streets
such
was
the
putrid
heap
of
life
fermenting
in
this
dismal
spot
an
unlucky
turn
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
a
ship
arrived
on
the
day
before
a
discharge
from
prison
a
dark
night
or
some
other
chance
had
cast
them
here
to
find
a
miserable
shelter
every
day
brought
some
new
accumulation
of
such
misery
let
him
enter
who
would
sleep
who
could
speak
who
dared
for
it
was
a
place
of
whispers
the
new
comers
hastened
to
bury
themselves
in
the
mass
or
tried
to
seek
oblivion
in
sleep
since
there
was
none
in
the
darkness
of
the
place
they
snatched
what
little
of
themselves
they
could
from
the
jaws
of
death
they
closed
their
eyes
in
that
confusion
of
horrors
which
every
day
renewed
they
were
the
embodiment
of
misery
thrown
off
from
society
as
the
scum
is
from
the
sea
it
was
not
every
one
who
could
even
get
a
share
of
the
straw
more
than
one
figure
was
stretched
out
naked
upon
the
flags
they
lay
down
worn
out
with
weariness
and
awoke
paralysed
the
well
without
lid
or
parapet
and
thirty
feet
in
depth
gaped
open
night
and
day
rain
fell
around
it
filth
accumulated
about
and
the
gutters
of
the
yard
ran
down
and
filtered
through
its
sides
the
pail
for
drawing
the
water
stood
by
the
side
those
who
were
thirsty
drank
there
some
disgusted
with
life
drowned
themselves
in
it
slipped
from
their
slumber
in
the
filthy
shed
into
that
profounder
sleep
in
the
year
the
body
of
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
old
was
taken
up
out
of
this
well
to
be
safe
in
this
house
it
was
necessary
to
be
of
the
right
sort
the
uninitiated
were
regarded
with
suspicion
did
these
miserable
wretches
then
know
each
other
no
yet
they
scented
out
the
genuine
guest
of
the
jacressade
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
a
young
and
rather
pretty
woman
wearing
a
cap
trimmed
with
ribbons
she
washed
herself
now
and
then
with
water
from
the
well
she
had
a
wooden
leg
at
break
of
day
the
courtyard
became
empty
its
inmates
dispersed
an
old
cock
and
some
other
fowls
were
kept
in
the
courtyard
where
they
raked
among
the
filth
of
the
place
all
day
long
a
long
horizontal
beam
supported
by
posts
traversed
the
yard
a
erection
not
out
of
keeping
with
the
associations
of
the
place
sometimes
on
the
morrow
of
a
a
silk
dress
mudded
and
wet
would
be
seen
hanging
out
to
dry
upon
this
beam
it
belonged
to
the
woman
with
the
wooden
leg
over
the
shed
and
like
it
surrounding
the
yard
was
a
story
and
above
this
story
a
loft
a
rotten
wooden
ladder
passing
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
shed
conducted
to
this
story
and
up
this
ladder
the
woman
would
climb
sometimes
staggering
while
its
crazy
rounds
creaked
beneath
her
the
occasional
lodgers
whether
by
the
week
or
the
night
slept
in
the
courtyard
the
regular
inmates
lived
in
the
house
windows
without
a
pane
of
glass
with
no
door
fireplaces
without
stoves
such
were
the
chief
features
of
the
interior
you
might
pass
from
one
room
to
the
other
indifferently
by
a
long
square
aperture
which
had
been
the
door
or
by
a
triangular
hole
between
the
joists
of
the
partitions
the
fallen
plaster
of
the
ceiling
lay
about
the
floor
it
was
difficult
to
say
how
the
old
house
still
stood
erect
the
high
winds
indeed
shook
it
the
lodgers
ascended
as
they
could
by
the
worn
and
slippery
steps
of
the
ladder
everything
was
open
to
the
air
the
wintry
atmosphere
was
absorbed
into
the
house
like
water
into
a
sponge
the
multitude
of
spiders
seemed
alone
to
guarantee
the
place
against
falling
to
pieces
immediately
there
was
no
sign
of
furniture
two
or
three
paillasses
were
in
the
corner
their
ticking
torn
in
parts
and
showing
more
dust
than
straw
within
here
and
there
were
a
and
an
earthen
pipkin
a
close
disagreeable
odour
haunted
the
rooms
the
windows
looked
out
upon
the
square
yard
the
scene
was
like
the
interior
of
a
scavenger
cart
the
things
not
to
speak
of
the
human
beings
which
lay
rusting
mouldering
and
putrefying
there
were
indescribable
the
fragments
seemed
to
fraternise
together
some
fell
from
the
walls
others
from
the
living
tenants
of
the
place
the
débris
were
sown
with
their
tatters
besides
the
floating
population
which
bivouacked
nightly
in
the
square
yard
the
jacressade
had
three
permanent
lodgers
a
charcoal
man
a
and
a
the
charcoal
man
and
the
occupied
two
of
the
paillasses
of
the
first
story
the
a
chemist
lodged
in
the
loft
which
was
called
no
one
knew
why
the
garret
nobody
knew
where
the
woman
slept
the
was
a
poet
in
a
small
way
he
inhabited
a
room
in
the
roof
under
the
tiles
a
chamber
with
a
narrow
window
and
a
large
stone
fireplace
forming
a
gulf
in
which
the
wind
howled
at
will
the
garret
window
having
no
frame
he
had
nailed
across
it
a
piece
of
iron
sheathing
part
of
the
wreck
of
a
ship
this
sheathing
left
little
room
for
the
entrance
of
light
and
much
for
the
entrance
of
cold
the
paid
rent
from
time
to
time
in
the
shape
of
a
sack
of
charcoal
the
paid
with
a
bowl
of
grain
for
the
fowls
every
week
the
did
not
pay
at
all
meanwhile
the
latter
consumed
the
very
house
itself
for
fuel
he
had
pulled
down
the
little
woodwork
which
remained
and
every
now
and
then
he
took
from
the
wall
or
the
roof
a
lath
or
some
scantling
to
heat
his
crucible
upon
the
partition
above
the
mattress
might
have
been
seen
two
columns
of
figures
marked
in
chalk
by
the
himself
from
week
to
week
a
column
of
threes
and
a
column
of
fives
according
as
the
bowl
of
grain
had
cost
him
three
liards
or
five

him
to
the

in
which
he
mixed

clubin
had
been
absent
from
the
jean
auberge
all
the
evening
of
tuesday
on
the
wednesday
night
he
was
absent
again
in
the
dusk
of
that
evening
two
strangers
penetrated
into
the
mazes
of
the
ruelle
coutanchez
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
jacressade
one
of
them
knocked
at
the
window
the
door
of
the
shop
opened
and
they
entered
the
woman
with
the
wooden
leg
met
them
with
the
smile
which
she
reserved
for
respectable
citizens
there
was
a
candle
on
the
table
the
strangers
were
in
fact
respectable
citizens
the
one
who
had
knocked
said
mistress
i
have
come
for
that
affair
the
woman
with
the
wooden
leg
smiled
again
and
went
out
by
the
leading
to
the
courtyard
and
where
the
well
was
a
moment
afterwards
the
was
opened
again
and
a
man
stood
in
the
doorway
he
wore
a
cap
and
a
blouse
it
was
easy
to
see
the
shape
of
something
under
his
blouse
he
had
bits
of
old
straw
in
his
clothes
and
looked
as
if
he
had
just
been
aroused
from
sleep
he
advanced
and
exchanged
glances
with
the
strangers
the
man
in
the
blouse
looked
puzzled
but
cunning
he
said
you
are
the
gunsmith
the
one
who
had
tapped
at
the
window
replied
yes
you
are
the
man
from
paris
known
as
redskin
yes
show
me
the
thing
the
man
took
from
under
his
blouse
a
weapon
extremely
rare
at
that
period
in
europe
it
was
a
revolver
the
weapon
was
new
and
bright
the
two
strangers
examined
it
the
one
who
seemed
to
know
the
house
and
whom
the
man
in
the
blouse
had
called
the
gunsmith
tried
the
mechanism
he
passed
the
weapon
to
the
other
who
appeared
less
at
home
there
and
kept
his
back
turned
to
the
light
the
gunsmith
continued
how
much
the
man
in
the
blouse
replied
i
have
just
brought
it
from
america
some
people
bring
monkeys
parrots
and
other
animals
as
if
the
french
people
were
savages
for
myself
i
brought
this
it
is
a
useful
invention
how
much
inquired
the
gunsmith
again
it
is
a
pistol
which
turns
and
turns
how
much
bang
the
first
fire
bang
the
second
fire
bang
the
third
fire
what
a
hailstorm
of
bullets
that
will
do
some
execution
the
price
there
are
six
barrels
well
well
what
do
you
want
for
it
six
barrels
that
is
six
louis
will
you
take
five
impossible
one
louis
a
ball
that
is
the
price
come
let
us
do
business
together
be
reasonable
i
have
named
a
fair
price
examine
the
weapon
mr
gunsmith
i
have
examined
it
the
barrel
twists
and
turns
like
talleyrand
himself
the
weapon
ought
to
be
mentioned
in
the
of
it
is
a
gem
i
have
looked
at
it
the
barrels
are
of
spanish
make
i
see
they
are
they
are
twisted
this
is
how
this
twisting
is
done
they
empty
into
a
forge
the
basket
of
a
collector
of
old
iron
they
fill
it
full
of
these
old
scraps
with
old
nails
and
broken
horseshoes
swept
out
of
shops
and
old
i
was
going
to
say
so
gunsmith
they
apply
to
all
this
rubbish
a
good
sweating
heat
and
this
makes
a
magnificent
material
for
yes
but
it
may
have
cracks
flaws
or
crosses
true
but
they
remedy
the
crosses
by
little
twists
and
avoid
the
risk
of
doublings
by
beating
hard
they
bring
their
mass
of
iron
under
the
great
hammer
give
it
two
more
good
sweating
heats
if
the
iron
has
been
heated
too
much
they
it
with
dull
heats
and
lighter
hammers
and
then
they
take
out
their
stuff
and
roll
it
well
and
with
this
iron
they
manufacture
you
a
weapon
like
this
you
are
in
the
trade
i
suppose
i
am
of
all
trades
the
barrels
are
that
the
beauty
of
them
gunsmith
the
tint
is
obtained
with
antimony
it
is
settled
then
that
we
give
you
five
louis
allow
me
to
observe
that
i
had
the
honour
of
saying
six
the
gunsmith
lowered
his
voice
hark
you
master
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
get
rid
of
this
thing
a
weapon
of
this
kind
is
of
no
use
to
a
man
like
you
it
will
make
you
remarked
it
is
very
true
said
the
parisian
it
is
rather
conspicuous
it
is
more
suited
to
a
gentleman
will
you
take
five
louis
no
six
one
for
every
shot
come
six
napoleons
i
will
have
six
louis
you
are
not
a
bonapartist
then
you
prefer
a
louis
to
a
napoleon
the
parisian
nicknamed
redskin
smiled
a
napoleon
is
greater
said
he
but
a
louis
is
worth
more
six
napoleons
six
louis
it
makes
a
difference
to
me
of
francs
the
bargain
is
off
in
that
case
good
i
keep
the
toy
keep
it
beating
me
down
a
good
idea
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
got
rid
like
that
of
a
wonderful
specimen
of
ingenuity
then
it
marks
a
whole
stage
in
the
progress
of
making
pistols
which
the
chesapeake
indians
call
five
louis
ready
money
why
it
is
a
handful
of
gold
that
signifies
gun
a
good
many
people
know
that
will
you
take
five
louis
and
just
a
bit
of
silver
i
said
six
master
the
man
who
kept
his
back
to
the
candle
and
who
had
not
yet
spoken
was
spending
his
time
during
the
dialogue
in
turning
and
testing
the
mechanism
of
the
pistol
he
approached
the
armourer
ear
and
whispered
is
it
a
good
weapon
excellent
i
will
give
the
six
louis
five
minutes
afterwards
while
the
parisian
nicknamed
redskin
was
depositing
the
six
louis
which
he
had
just
received
in
a
secret
slit
under
the
breast
of
his
blouse
the
armourer
and
his
companion
carrying
the
revolver
in
his
trousers
pocket
stepped
out
into
the
straggling
street
viii
a
cannon
off
the
red
ball
and
the
black
on
the
morrow
which
was
a
thursday
a
tragic
circumstance
occurred
at
a
short
distance
from
malo
near
the
peak
of
the
décollé
a
spot
where
the
cliff
is
high
and
the
sea
deep
a
line
of
rocks
in
the
form
of
the
top
of
a
lance
and
connecting
themselves
with
the
land
by
a
narrow
isthmus
stretch
out
there
into
the
water
ending
abruptly
with
a
large
breaker
nothing
is
commoner
in
the
architecture
of
the
sea
in
attempting
to
reach
the
plateau
of
the
peaked
rock
from
the
shore
it
was
necessary
to
follow
an
inclined
plane
the
ascent
of
which
was
here
and
there
somewhat
steep
it
was
upon
a
plateau
of
this
kind
towards
four
in
the
afternoon
that
a
man
was
standing
enveloped
in
a
large
military
cape
and
armed
a
fact
easy
to
be
perceived
from
certain
straight
and
angular
folds
in
his
mantle
the
summit
on
which
this
man
was
resting
was
a
rather
extensive
platform
dotted
with
large
masses
of
rock
like
enormous
leaving
between
them
narrow
passages
this
platform
on
which
a
kind
of
thick
short
grass
grew
here
and
there
came
to
an
end
on
the
sea
side
in
an
open
space
leading
to
a
perpendicular
escarpment
the
escarpment
rising
about
sixty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
seemed
cut
down
by
the
aid
of
a
its
left
angle
however
was
broken
away
and
formed
one
of
those
natural
staircases
common
to
granite
cliffs
worn
by
the
sea
the
steps
of
which
are
somewhat
inconvenient
requiring
sometimes
the
strides
of
a
giant
or
the
leaps
of
an
acrobat
these
stages
of
rock
descended
perpendicularly
to
the
sea
where
they
were
lost
it
was
a
place
however
in
case
of
absolute
necessity
a
man
might
succeed
in
embarking
there
under
the
very
wall
of
the
cliff
a
breeze
was
sweeping
the
sea
the
man
wrapped
in
his
cape
and
standing
firm
with
his
left
hand
grasping
his
right
shoulder
closed
one
eye
and
applied
the
other
to
a
telescope
he
seemed
absorbed
in
anxious
scrutiny
he
had
approached
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
and
stood
there
motionless
his
gaze
immovably
fixed
on
the
horizon
the
tide
was
high
the
waves
were
beating
below
against
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
the
object
which
the
stranger
was
observing
was
a
vessel
in
the
offing
and
which
was
manoeuvring
in
a
strange
manner
the
vessel
which
had
hardly
left
the
port
of
malo
an
hour
had
stopped
behind
the
banquetiers
it
had
not
cast
anchor
perhaps
because
the
bottom
would
only
have
permitted
it
to
bear
to
leeward
on
the
edge
of
the
cable
and
because
the
ship
would
have
strained
on
her
anchor
under
the
cutwater
her
captain
had
contented
himself
with
the
stranger
who
was
a
as
was
apparent
from
his
uniform
cape
watched
all
the
movements
of
the
and
seemed
to
note
them
mentally
the
vessel
was
a
little
off
the
wind
which
was
indicated
by
the
backing
of
the
small
topsail
and
the
bellying
of
the
she
had
squared
the
mizen
and
set
the
topmast
as
close
as
possible
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
work
the
sails
against
each
other
and
to
make
little
way
either
on
or
off
shore
her
captain
evidently
did
not
care
to
expose
his
vessel
much
to
the
wind
for
he
had
only
braced
up
the
small
in
this
way
coming
crossway
on
he
did
not
drift
at
the
utmost
more
than
half
a
league
an
hour
it
was
still
broad
daylight
particularly
on
the
open
sea
and
on
the
heights
of
the
cliff
the
shores
below
were
becoming
dark
the
still
engaged
in
his
duty
and
carefully
scanning
the
offing
had
not
thought
of
observing
the
rocks
at
his
side
and
at
his
feet
he
turned
his
back
towards
the
difficult
sort
of
causeway
which
formed
the
communication
between
his
and
the
shore
he
did
not
therefore
remark
that
something
was
moving
in
that
direction
behind
a
fragment
of
rock
among
the
steps
of
that
causeway
something
like
the
figure
of
a
man
had
been
concealed
according
to
all
appearances
since
the
arrival
of
the
from
time
to
time
a
head
issued
from
the
shadow
behind
the
rock
looked
up
and
watched
the
watcher
the
head
surmounted
by
a
american
hat
was
that
of
the
man
who
ten
days
before
was
talking
among
the
stones
of
the
to
captain
zuela
suddenly
the
curiosity
of
the
seemed
to
be
still
more
strongly
awakened
he
polished
the
glass
of
his
telescope
quickly
with
his
sleeve
and
brought
it
to
bear
closely
upon
the
a
little
black
spot
seemed
to
detach
itself
from
her
side
the
black
spot
looking
like
a
small
insect
upon
the
water
was
a
boat
the
boat
seemed
to
be
making
for
the
shore
it
was
manned
by
several
sailors
who
were
pulling
vigorously
she
pulled
crosswise
by
little
and
little
and
appeared
to
be
approaching
the
pointe
du
décollé
the
gaze
of
the
seemed
to
have
reached
its
most
intense
point
no
movement
of
the
boat
escaped
it
he
had
approached
nearer
still
to
the
verge
of
the
rock
at
that
instant
a
man
of
large
stature
appeared
on
one
of
the
rocks
behind
him
it
was
the
quaker
the
officer
did
not
see
him
the
man
paused
an
instant
his
arms
at
his
sides
but
with
his
fists
doubled
and
with
the
eye
of
a
hunter
watching
for
his
prey
he
observed
the
back
of
the
officer
four
steps
only
separated
them
he
put
one
foot
forward
then
stopped
took
a
second
step
and
stopped
again
he
made
no
movement
except
the
act
of
walking
all
the
rest
of
his
body
was
motionless
as
a
statue
his
foot
fell
upon
the
tufts
of
grass
without
noise
he
made
a
third
step
and
paused
again
he
was
almost
within
reach
of
the
who
stood
there
still
motionless
with
his
telescope
the
man
brought
his
two
closed
fists
to
a
level
with
his
then
struck
out
his
arms
sharply
and
his
two
fists
as
if
thrown
from
a
sling
struck
the
on
the
two
shoulders
the
shock
was
decisive
the
had
not
the
time
to
utter
a
cry
he
fell
head
first
from
the
height
of
the
rock
into
the
sea
his
boots
appeared
in
the
air
about
the
time
occupied
by
a
flash
of
lightning
it
was
like
the
fall
of
a
stone
in
the
sea
which
instantly
closed
over
him
two
or
three
circles
widened
out
upon
the
dark
water
nothing
remained
but
the
telescope
which
had
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
man
and
lay
upon
the
turf
the
quaker
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
a
moment
watched
the
circles
vanishing
on
the
water
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
rose
again
singing
in
a
low
voice
the
captain
of
police
is
dead
through
having
lost
his
life
he
knelt
down
a
second
time
nothing
reappeared
only
at
the
spot
where
the
officer
had
been
engulfed
he
observed
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
sort
of
dark
spot
which
became
diffused
with
the
gentle
lapping
of
the
waves
it
seemed
probable
that
the
had
fractured
his
skull
against
some
rock
under
water
and
that
his
blood
caused
the
spot
in
the
foam
the
quaker
while
considering
the
meaning
of
this
spot
began
to
sing
again
not
very
long
before
he
died
the
luckless
man
was
still
alive
he
did
not
finish
his
song
he
heard
an
extremely
soft
voice
behind
him
which
said
is
that
you
rantaine
you
have
just
killed
a
man
he
turned
about
fifteen
paces
behind
him
in
one
of
the
passages
between
the
rocks
stood
a
little
man
holding
a
revolver
in
his
hand
the
quaker
answered
as
you
see
sieur
clubin
the
little
man
started
you
know
me
you
knew
me
very
well
replied
rantaine
meanwhile
they
could
hear
a
sound
of
oars
on
the
sea
it
was
the
approach
of
the
boat
which
the
officer
had
observed
sieur
clubin
said
in
a
low
tone
as
if
speaking
to
himself
it
was
done
quickly
what
can
i
do
to
oblige
you
asked
rantaine
oh
a
trifling
matter
it
is
very
nearly
ten
years
since
i
saw
you
you
must
have
been
doing
well
how
are
you
well
enough
answered
rantaine
how
are
you
very
well
replied
clubin
rantaine
advanced
a
step
towards
clubin
a
little
sharp
click
caught
his
ear
it
was
sieur
clubin
who
was
cocking
his
revolver
rantaine
there
are
about
fifteen
paces
between
us
it
is
a
nice
distance
remain
where
you
are
very
well
said
rantaine
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
oh
i
have
come
to
have
a
chat
with
you
rantaine
did
not
offer
to
move
again
sieur
clubin
continued
you
assassinated
a
just
now
rantaine
lifted
the
flap
of
his
hat
and
replied
you
have
already
done
me
the
honour
to
mention
it
exactly
but
in
terms
less
precise
i
said
a
man
i
say
now
a
the
man
wore
the
number
he
was
the
father
of
a
family
leaves
a
wife
and
five
children
that
is
no
doubt
correct
said
rantaine
there
was
a
momentary
pause
they
are
picked
men
those
people
continued
clubin
almost
all
old
sailors
i
have
remarked
said
rantaine
that
people
generally
do
leave
a
wife
and
five
children
sieur
clubin
continued
guess
how
much
this
revolver
cost
me
it
is
a
pretty
tool
said
rantaine
what
do
you
guess
it
at
i
should
guess
it
at
a
good
deal
it
cost
me
one
hundred
and
francs
you
must
have
bought
that
said
rantaine
at
the
shop
in
the
ruelle
coutanchez
clubin
continued
he
did
not
cry
out
the
fall
stopped
his
voice
no
doubt
sieur
clubin
there
will
be
a
breeze
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
secret
do
you
still
stay
at
the
jean
auberge
yes
you
are
not
badly
served
there
i
remember
getting
some
excellent
there
you
must
be
exceedingly
strong
rantaine
what
shoulders
you
have
i
should
be
sorry
to
get
a
tap
from
you
i
on
the
other
hand
when
i
came
into
the
world
looked
so
spare
and
sickly
that
they
despaired
of
rearing
me
they
succeeded
though
which
was
lucky
yes
i
still
stay
at
the
jean
auberge
do
you
know
sieur
clubin
how
i
recognised
you
it
was
from
your
having
recognised
me
i
said
to
myself
there
is
nobody
like
sieur
clubin
for
that
and
he
advanced
a
step
stand
back
where
you
were
rantaine
rantaine
fell
back
and
said
to
himself
a
fellow
becomes
like
a
child
before
one
of
those
weapons
sieur
clubin
continued
the
position
of
affairs
is
this
we
have
on
our
right
in
the
direction
of
enogat
at
about
three
hundred
paces
from
here
another
his
number
is
who
is
still
alive
and
on
our
left
in
the
direction
of
lunaire
a
customs
station
that
makes
seven
armed
men
who
could
be
here
if
necessary
in
five
minutes
the
rock
would
be
surrounded
the
way
hither
guarded
impossible
to
elude
them
there
is
a
corpse
at
the
foot
of
this
rock
rantaine
took
a
glance
at
the
revolver
as
you
say
rantaine
it
is
a
pretty
tool
perhaps
it
is
only
loaded
with
powder
but
what
does
that
matter
a
report
would
be
enough
to
bring
an
armed
force
and
i
have
six
barrels
here
the
measured
sound
of
the
oars
became
very
distinct
the
boat
was
not
far
off
the
tall
man
regarded
the
little
man
curiously
sieur
clubin
spoke
in
a
voice
more
and
more
soft
and
subdued
rantaine
the
men
in
the
boat
which
is
coming
knowing
what
you
did
here
just
now
would
lend
a
hand
and
help
to
arrest
you
you
are
to
pay
captain
zuela
ten
thousand
francs
for
your
passage
you
would
have
made
a
better
bargain
by
the
way
with
the
smugglers
of
pleinmont
but
they
would
only
have
taken
you
to
england
and
besides
you
can
not
risk
going
to
guernsey
where
they
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
to
return
then
to
the
position
of
affairs
if
i
fire
you
are
arrested
you
are
to
pay
zuela
for
your
passage
ten
thousand
francs
you
have
already
paid
him
five
thousand
in
advance
zuela
would
keep
the
five
thousand
and
be
gone
these
are
the
facts
rantaine
you
have
managed
your
masquerading
very
well
that
hat
that
queer
coat
and
those
gaiters
make
a
wonderful
change
you
forgot
the
spectacles
but
did
right
to
let
your
whiskers
grow
rantaine
smiled
spasmodically
clubin
continued
rantaine
you
have
on
a
pair
of
american
breeches
with
a
double
fob
in
one
side
you
keep
your
watch
take
care
of
it
thank
you
sieur
clubin
in
the
other
is
a
little
box
made
of
wrought
iron
which
opens
and
shuts
with
a
spring
it
is
an
old
sailor
take
it
out
of
your
pocket
and
throw
it
over
to
me
why
this
is
robbery
you
are
at
liberty
to
call
the
and
clubin
fixed
his
eye
on
rantaine
stay
mess
clubin
said
rantaine
making
a
slight
forward
movement
and
holding
out
his
open
hand
the
title
mess
was
a
delicate
flattery
stay
where
you
are
rantaine
mess
clubin
let
us
come
to
terms
i
offer
you
half
clubin
crossed
his
arms
still
showing
the
barrels
of
his
revolver
rantaine
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
am
an
honest
man
and
he
added
after
a
pause
i
must
have
the
whole
rantaine
muttered
between
his
teeth
this
fellow
of
a
stern
sort
the
eye
of
clubin
lighted
up
his
voice
became
clear
and
sharp
as
steel
he
cried
i
see
that
you
are
labouring
under
a
mistake
robbery

your
name
not
mine
my
name

which
belonged
to
you
but
forgetting
to
leave

fifty
thousand
francs

he
gave
you
three
notes
of
the
bank
of
england
for
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
each
plus
the
exchange
you
put
these
in
the
iron
and
the
iron
into
your
double
fob
on
the
side
on
the
part
of
mess

to

the
rantaine
dipped
his
hand
in
the
fob
drew
out
a
little
box
and
threw
it
to
clubin
it
was
the
iron
it
fell
and
rolled
at
feet
clubin
knelt
without
lowering
his
gaze
felt
about
for
the
box
with
his
left
hand
keeping
all
the
while
his
eyes
and
the
six
barrels
of
the
revolver
fixed
upon
rantaine
then
he
cried
turn
your
back
my
friend
rantaine
turned
his
back
sieur
clubin
put
the
revolver
under
one
arm
and
touched
the
spring
of
the
the
lid
flew
open
it
contained
four
three
of
a
thousand
pounds
and
one
of
ten
pounds
he
folded
up
the
three
of
a
thousand
pounds
each
replaced
them
in
the
iron
shut
the
lid
again
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
picked
up
a
stone
wrapped
it
in
the
note
and
said
you
may
turn
round
again
rantaine
turned
sieur
clubin
continued
i
told
you
i
would
be
contented
with
three
thousand
pounds
here
i
return
you
ten
pounds
and
he
threw
to
rantaine
the
note
enfolding
the
stone
rantaine
with
a
movement
of
his
foot
sent
the
and
the
stone
into
the
sea
as
you
please
said
clubin
you
must
be
rich
i
am
satisfied
the
noise
of
oars
which
had
been
continually
drawing
nearer
during
the
dialogue
ceased
they
knew
by
this
that
the
boat
had
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
your
vehicle
waits
below
you
can
go
rantaine
rantaine
advanced
towards
the
steps
of
stones
and
rapidly
disappeared
clubin
moved
cautiously
towards
the
edge
of
the
escarpment
and
watched
him
descending
the
boat
had
stopped
near
the
last
stage
of
the
rocks
at
the
very
spot
where
the
had
fallen
still
observing
rantaine
stepping
from
stone
to
stone
clubin
muttered
a
good
number
he
thought
himself
alone
rantaine
thought
there
were
only
two
there
i
alone
knew
that
there
were
three
he
perceived
at
his
feet
the
telescope
which
had
dropped
from
the
hands
of
the
the
sound
of
oars
was
heard
again
rantaine
had
stepped
into
the
boat
and
the
rowers
had
pushed
out
to
sea
when
rantaine
was
safely
in
the
boat
and
the
cliff
was
beginning
to
recede
from
his
eyes
he
arose
again
abruptly
his
features
were
convulsed
with
rage
he
clenched
his
fist
and
cried
ha
he
is
the
devil
himself
a
villain
a
few
seconds
later
clubin
from
the
top
of
the
rock
while
bringing
his
telescope
to
bear
upon
the
boat
heard
distinctly
the
following
words
articulated
by
a
loud
voice
and
mingling
with
the
noise
of
the
sea
sieur
clubin
you
are
an
honest
man
but
you
will
not
be
offended
if
i
write
to
lethierry
to
acquaint
him
with
this
matter
and
we
have
here
in
the
boat
a
sailor
from
guernsey
who
is
one
of
the
crew
of
the
his
name
is
and
he
will
return
to
malo
on
zuela
next
voyage
to
bear
testimony
to
the
fact
of
my
having
returned
to
you
on
mess
lethierry
account
the
sum
of
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
it
was
rantaine
voice
clubin
rarely
did
things
by
halves
motionless
as
the
had
been
and
in
the
exact
same
place
his
eye
still
at
the
telescope
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
boat
for
one
moment
he
saw
it
growing
less
amidst
the
waves
watched
it
disappear
and
reappear
and
approach
the
vessel
which
was
finally
he
recognised
the
tall
figure
of
rantaine
on
the
deck
of
the
when
the
boat
was
raised
and
slung
again
to
the
davits
the
was
in
motion
once
more
the
was
fresh
and
she
spread
all
her
sails
clubin
glass
continued
fixed
upon
her
outline
growing
more
and
more
indistinct
until
half
an
hour
later
when
the
had
become
only
a
dark
shape
upon
the
horizon
growing
smaller
and
smaller
against
the
pale
twilight
in
the
sky
ix
useful
information
for
persons
who
expect
or
fear
the
arrival
of
letters
from
beyond
sea
on
that
evening
sieur
clubin
returned
late
one
of
the
causes
of
his
delay
was
that
before
going
to
his
inn
he
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
dinan
gate
of
the
town
a
place
where
there
were
several
in
one
of
these
where
he
was
not
known
he
had
bought
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
he
placed
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
as
if
he
desired
to
conceal
it
then
as
the
durande
was
to
start
on
the
following
morning
he
had
taken
a
turn
aboard
to
satisfy
himself
that
everything
was
in
order
when
sieur
clubin
returned
to
the
jean
auberge
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
lower
room
except
the
old
who
was
drinking
a
jug
of
ale
and
smoking
his
pipe
saluted
sieur
clubin
between
a
whiff
and
a
draught
of
ale
how
d
do
captain
clubin
good
evening
captain
gertrais
well
the
is
gone
ah
said
clubin
i
did
not
observe
captain
expectorated
and
said
zuela
has
decamped
when
was
that
this
evening
where
is
he
gone
to
the
devil
no
doubt
but
where
is
that
to
arequipa
i
knew
nothing
of
it
said
clubin
he
added
i
am
going
to
bed
he
lighted
his
candle
walked
towards
the
door
and
returned
have
you
ever
been
at
arequipa
captain
yes
some
years
ago
where
do
they
touch
on
that
voyage
a
little
everywhere
but
the
will
touch
nowhere
emptied
his
pipe
upon
the
corner
of
a
plate
and
continued
you
know
the
lugger
called
the
and
that
fine
the
which
are
gone
to
cardiff
i
was
against
their
sailing
on
account
of
the
weather
they
have
returned
in
a
fine
state
the
lugger
was
laden
with
turpentine
she
sprang
a
leak
and
in
working
the
pumps
they
pumped
up
with
the
water
all
her
cargo
as
to
the
she
has
suffered
most
above
water
her
cutwater
her
headrail
the
stock
of
her
larboard
anchor
are
broken
her
standing
jibboom
is
gone
clean
by
the
cap
as
for
the
and
bobstays
go
and
see
what
they
look
like
the
mizenmast
is
not
injured
but
has
had
a
severe
shock
all
the
iron
of
the
bowsprit
has
given
way
and
it
is
an
extraordinary
fact
that
though
the
bowsprit
itself
is
not
scratched
it
is
completely
stripped
the
of
the
vessel
is
stove
in
a
good
three
feet
square
this
is
what
comes
of
not
taking
advice
clubin
had
placed
the
candle
on
the
table
and
had
begun
to
readjust
a
row
of
pins
which
he
kept
in
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
he
continued
did
you
say
captain
that
the
would
not
touch
anywhere
yes
she
goes
direct
to
chili
in
that
case
she
can
send
no
news
of
herself
on
the
voyage
i
beg
your
pardon
captain
clubin
in
the
first
place
she
can
send
any
letters
by
vessels
she
may
meet
sailing
for
europe
that
is
true
then
there
is
the
ocean
what
do
you
mean
by
the
ocean
do
you
know
what
that
is
captain
clubin
no
when
you
pass
the
straits
of
magellan
well
snow
all
round
you
always
bad
weather
ugly
and
bad
seas
well
when
you
have
doubled
cape
monmouth
well
what
next
then
you
double
cape
valentine
and
then
why
then
you
double
cape
isidore
and
afterwards
you
double
point
anne
good
but
what
is
it
you
call
the
ocean
we
are
coming
to
that
mountains
on
the
right
mountains
on
the
left
penguins
and
stormy
petrels
all
about
a
terrible
place
ah
by
jove
what
a
howling
and
what
cracks
you
get
there
the
hurricane
wants
no
help
that
the
place
for
holding
on
to
the
for
reefing
topsails
that
where
you
take
in
the
mainsail
and
fly
the
jibsail
or
take
in
the
jibsail
and
try
the
stormjib
gusts
upon
gusts
and
then
sometimes
four
five
or
six
days
of
scudding
under
bare
poles
often
only
a
rag
of
canvas
left
what
a
dance
squalls
enough
to
make
a
skip
like
a
flea
i
saw
once
a
hanging
on
to
the
jibboom
of
an
english
brig
the
knocked
jibboom
and
all
to
ten
thousand
nothings
fellows
are
swept
into
the
air
there
like
butterflies
i
saw
the
second
mate
of
the
a
pretty
schooner
knocked
from
under
the
and
killed
dead
i
have
had
my
smashed
and
come
out
with
all
my
sails
in
ribbons
frigates
of
fifty
guns
make
water
like
wicker
baskets
and
the
damnable
coast
nothing
can
be
imagined
more
dangerous
rocks
all
you
come
by
and
by
to
port
famine
there
it
worse
and
worse
the
worst
seas
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
devil
own
latitudes
all
of
a
sudden
you
spy
the
words
painted
in
red
office
what
do
you
mean
captain
gertrais
i
mean
captain
clubin
that
immediately
after
doubling
point
anne
you
see
on
a
rock
a
hundred
feet
high
a
great
post
with
a
barrel
suspended
to
the
top
this
barrel
is
the
the
english
sailors
must
needs
go
and
write
up
there
office
what
had
they
to
do
with
it
it
is
the

it
is
the
property
of
that
worthy

the

the

is
common
to
all
it
belongs
to
every

office
there
a
word
for
you
it
produces
an
effect
on
me
as
if
the
devil
had
suddenly
offered
me
a
cup
of
tea
i
will
tell
you
now
how
the
postal
arrangements
are
carried
out
every
vessel
which
passes
sends
to
the
post
a
boat
with
despatches
a
vessel
coming
from
the
atlantic
for
instance
sends
there
its
letters
for
europe
and
a
ship
coming
from
the
pacific
its
letters
for
new
zealand
or
california
the
officer
in
command
of
the
boat
puts
his
packet
into
the
barrel
and
takes
away
any
packet
he
finds
there
you
take
charge
of
these
letters
and
the
ship
which
comes
after
you
takes
charge
of
yours
as
ships
are
always
going
to
and
fro
the
continent
whence
you
come
is
that
to
which
i
am
going
i
carry
your
letters
you
carry
mine
the
barrel
is
made
fast
to
the
post
with
a
chain
and
it
rains
snows
and
hails
a
pretty
sea
the
imps
of
satan
fly
about
on
every
side
the
will
pass
there
the
barrel
has
a
good
lid
with
a
hinge
but
no
padlock
you
see
a
fellow
can
write
to
his
friends
this
way
the
letters
come
safely
it
is
very
curious
muttered
clubin
thoughtfully
captain
returned
to
his
bottle
of
ale
if
that
vagabond
zuela
should
write
continued
clubin
aside
the
scoundrel
puts
his
scrawl
into
the

at
magellan
and
in
four
months
i
have
his

well
captain
clubin
do
you
start
clubin
absorbed
in
a
sort
of
somnambulism
did
not
notice
the

and
captain

repeated
it
clubin
woke
up
of
course
captain
gertrais
it
is
my

i
must
start

if
it

have
a
too
which
gives
me
a
warning
the
moon
is
at
her
second
quarter
it
is
the
maximum
of
humidity
i
noticed
some
pimpernels
with
their
leaves
shut
and
a
field
of
clover
with
its
stalks
all
stiff
the
worms
come
out
of
the
ground
the
flies
sting
the
bees
keep
close
to
their
hives
the
sparrows
chatter
together
you
can
hear
the
sound
of
bells
from
far
off
i
heard
the
angelus
at
lunaire
and
then
the
sun
set
angry
there
will
be
a
good
fog
mark
my
words
i
do
advise
you
to
put
to

i
dread

is
a

of
rocks
called

the

this
term
douvres
applied
to
rocks
and
cliffs
is
very
common
there
is
for
example
near
the

douvre
on
which
a
lighthouse
is
now
being
constructed
a
dangerous
reef

one
which
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
rock
above
referred
to
the

on

coast

cape

the
douvres
are
a
little
further
from
the

of
france
than
from
the

the
distance
from

may
be
pretty
nearly
measured
by
the
extreme
length
of

a

there
at
a
depth
to

in

float
about

quivering

about

in
the
imagination
like
beholding
the
vast
unknown

from
its
most
terrible
point
of
view
the
submarine
gulf
is
analogous
to
the
realm
of
night
and
dreams
there
also
is
sleep
unconsciousness
or
at
least
apparent
unconsciousness
of
creation
there
in
the
awful
silence
and
darkness
the
rude
first
forms
of
life
demoniacal
pursue
their
horrible
instincts
forty
years
ago
two
rocks
of
singular
form
signalled
the
douvres
from
afar
to
passers
on
the
ocean
they
were
two
vertical
points
sharp
and
curved
their
summits
almost
touching
each
other
they
looked
like
the
two
tusks
of
an
elephant
rising
out
of
the
sea
but
they
were
tusks
high
as
tall
towers
of
an
elephant
huge
as
a
mountain
these
two
natural
towers
rising
out
of
the
obscure
home
of
marine
monsters
only
left
a
narrow
passage
between
them
where
the
waves
rushed
through
this
passage
tortuous
and
full
of
angles
resembled
a
straggling
street
between
high
walls
the
two
twin
rocks
are
called
the
douvres
there
was
the
great
douvre
and
the
little
douvre
one
was
sixty
feet
high
the
other
forty
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
had
at
last
worn
away
part
of
the
base
of
the
towers
and
a
violent
equinoctial
gale
on
the
of
october
overthrew
one
of
them
the
smaller
one
which
still
remains
is
worn
and
tottering
one
of
the
most
singular
of
the
douvres
is
a
rock
known
as
the
man
this
still
exists
some
fisherman
in
the
last
century
visiting
this
spot
found
on
the
height
of
the
rock
a
human
body
by
its
side
were
a
number
of
empty
a
sailor
escaped
from
shipwreck
had
found
a
refuge
there
had
lived
some
time
upon
rock
limpets
and
had
died
hence
its
name
of
the
man
the
solitudes
of
the
sea
are
peculiarly
dismal
the
things
which
pass
there
seem
to
have
no
relation
to
the
human
race
their
objects
are
unknown
such
is
the
isolation
of
the
douvres
all
around
as
far
as

can
reach

evidently
in
his
dotage
sieur
clubin
numerous
occupations
had
decidedly
been
unfavourable
to
the
collection
of
freight
for
the
durande
he
had
only
taken
aboard
some
packages
of
parisian
articles
for
the
fancy

of

three
cases
for

containing

brought

of
crushed

and
three

of

which
the

would
not

of

his

reputation
the

of

from

were
an

this
was
strictly
true
the

are
like
england
an
aristocratic
region
castes
exist
there
still
the
castes
have
their
peculiar
ideas
which
are
in
fact
their
protection
these
notions
of
caste
are
everywhere
similar
in
hindostan
as
in
germany
nobility
is
won
by
the
sword
lost
by
soiling
the
hands
with
labour
but
preserved
by
idleness
to
do
nothing
is
to
live
nobly
whoever
abstains
from
work
is
honoured
a
trade
is
fatal
in
france
in

times
there
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
except
in
the
case
of
glass
manufacturers
emptying
bottles
being
then
one
of
the
glories
of

was
probably
for
that
reason
not
considered
dishonourable
in

in

he
who

contrive

of

the

of

make
mention
of

from

in

a
noble
falls
into
poverty
he
is
soon
eliminated
from
the
order
a
mere
change
of
pronunciation
is
enough
tangroville
becomes
tangrouille
and
the
thing
is
done
this
had
been
the
fate
of
the
helmsman
of
the
durande
at
the
bordagé
of
peter
port
there
is
a
dealer
in
old
iron
named
ingrouille
who
is
probably
an
ingroville
under
lewis
le
gros
the
ingrovilles
possessed
three
parishes
in
the
district
of
valognes
a
certain
abbé
trigan
has
written
an
ecclesiastical
history
of
normandy
this
chronicler
trigan
was
the
curé
of
the
seigniory
of
digoville
the
sire
of
digoville
if
he
had
sunk
to
a
lower
grade
would
have
been
called
digouille
tangrouille
this
probable
tancarville
and
possible
montmorency
had
an
ancient
noble
quality
but
a
grave
failing
for
a
steersman
he
got
drunk
occasionally
sieur
clubin
had
obstinately
determined
to
retain
him
he
answered
for
his
conduct
to
mess
lethierry
tangrouille
the
helmsman
never
left
the
vessel
he
slept
aboard
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
when
sieur
clubin
came
at
a
late
hour
to
inspect
the
vessel
the
steersman
was
in
his
hammock
asleep
in
the
night
tangrouille
awoke
it
was
his
nightly
habit
every
drunkard
who
is
not
his
own
master
has
his
secret
tangrouille
had
his
which
he
called
his
store
the
secret
store
of
tangrouille
was
in
the
hold
he
had
placed
it
there
to
put
others
off
the
scent
he
thought
it
certain
that
his
was
known
only
to
himself
captain
clubin
being
a
sober
man
himself
was
strict
the
little
rum
or
gin
which
the
helmsman
could
conceal
from
the
vigilant
eyes
of
the
captain
he
kept
in
reserve
in
this
mysterious
corner
of
the
hold
and
nearly
every
night
he
had
a
stolen
interview
with
the
contents
of
this
store
the
surveillance
was
rigorous
the
orgie
was
a
poor
one
and
tangrouille
nightly
excesses
were
generally
confined
to
two
or
three
furtive
draughts
sometimes
it
happened
that
the
store
was
empty
this
night
tangrouille
had
found
there
an
unexpected
bottle
of
brandy
his
joy
was
great
but
his
astonishment
greater
from
what
cloud
had
it
fallen
he
could
not
remember
when
or
how
he
had
ever
brought
it
into
the
ship
he
soon
however
consumed
the
whole
of
it
partly
from
motives
of
prudence
and
partly
from
a
fear
that
the
brandy
might
be
discovered
and
seized
the
bottle
he
threw
overboard
in
the
morning
when
he
took
the
helm
tangrouille
exhibited
a
slight
oscillation
of
the
body
he
steered
however
pretty
nearly
as
usual
with
regard
to
clubin
he
had
gone
as
the
reader
knows
to
sleep
at
the
jean
auberge
clubin
always
wore
under
his
shirt
a
leathern
travelling
belt
in
which
he
kept
a
reserve
of
twenty
guineas
he
took
this
belt
off
only
at
night
inside
the
belt
was
his
name
clubin
written
by
himself
on
the
rough
leather
with
thick
lithographer
ink
which
is
indelible
on
rising
just
before
his
departure
he
put
into
this
girdle
the
iron
box
containing
the
thousand
francs
in
then
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
he
buckled
the
belt
round
his
body

conversations
interrupted
the
durande
started
pleasantly
the
passengers
as
soon
as
their
bags
and
portmanteaus
were
installed
upon
and
under
the
benches
took
that
customary
survey
of
the
vessel
which
seems
indispensable
under
the
circumstances
two
of
the
passengers
the
tourist
and
the
parisian
had
never
seen
a
before
and
from
the
moment
the
paddles
began
to
revolve
they
stood
admiring
the
foam
then
they
looked
with
wonderment
at
the
smoke
then
they
examined
one
by
one
and
almost
piece
by
piece
upon
the
upper
and
lower
deck
all
those
naval
appliances
such
as
rings
grapnels
hooks
and
bolts
which
with
their
nice
precision
and
adaptation
form
a
kind
of
colossal
a
sort
of
iron
jewellery
fantastically
gilded
with
rust
by
the
weather
they
walked
round
the
little
signal
gun
upon
the
upper
deck
chained
up
like
a
sporting
dog
observed
the
tourist
and
covered
with
a
waterproof
coat
to
prevent
its
taking
cold
added
the
parisian
as
they
left
the
land
further
behind
they
indulged
in
the
customary
observations
upon
the
view
of
malo
one
passenger
laid
down
the
axiom
that
the
approach
to
a
place
by
sea
is
always
deceptive
and
that
at
a
league
from
the
shore
for
example
nothing
could
more
resemble
ostend
than
dunkirk
he
completed
his
series
of
remarks
on
dunkirk
by
the
observation
that
one
of
its
two
floating
lights
painted
red
was
called
and
the
other
malo
meanwhile
grew
smaller
in
the
distance
and
finally
disappeared
from
view
the
aspect
of
the
sea
was
a
vast
calm
the
furrow
left
in
the
water
by
the
vessel
was
a
long
double
line
edged
with
foam
and
stretching
straight
behind
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
a
straight
line
drawn
from
malo
in
france
to
exeter
in
england
would
touch
the
island
of
guernsey
the
straight
line
at
sea
is
not
always
the
one
chosen
however
have
to
a
certain
extent
a
power
of
following
the
direct
course
denied
to
sailing
ships
the
wind
in
with
the
sea
is
a
combination
of
forces
a
ship
is
a
combination
of
appliances
forces
are
machines
of
infinite
power
machines
are
forces
of
limited
power
that
struggle
which
we
call
navigation
is
between
these
two
organisations
the
one
inexhaustible
the
other
intelligent
mind
directing
the
mechanism
forms
the
counterbalance
to
the
infinite
power
of
the
opposing
forces
but
the
opposing
forces
too
have
their
organisation
the
elements
are
conscious
of
where
they
go
and
what
they
are
about
no
force
is
merely
blind
it
is
the
function
of
man
to
keep
watch
upon
these
natural
agents
and
to
discover
their
laws
while
these
laws
are
still
in
great
part
undiscovered
the
struggle
continues
and
in
this
struggle
navigation
by
the
help
of
steam
is
a
perpetual
victory
won
by
human
skill
every
hour
of
the
day
and
upon
every
point
of
the
sea
the
admirable
feature
in
steam
navigation
is
that
it
disciplines
the
very
ship
herself
it
diminishes
her
obedience
to
the
winds
and
increases
her
docility
to
man
the
durande
had
never
worked
better
at
sea
than
on
that
day
she
made
her
way
marvellously
towards
eleven
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
from
the
the
durande
was
off
the
minquiers
under
little
steam
keeping
her
head
to
the
west
on
the
starboard
tack
and
close
up
to
the
wind
the
weather
was
still
fine
and
clear
the
trawlers
however
were
making
for
shore
by
little
and
little
as
if
each
one
was
anxious
to
get
into
port
the
sea
became
clear
of
the
boats
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
durande
was
keeping
quite
her
usual
course
the
crew
gave
no
thought
to
such
matters
the
confidence
in
the
captain
was
absolute
yet
perhaps
through
the
fault
of
the
helmsman
there
was
a
slight
deviation
the
durande
appeared
to
be
making
rather
towards
jersey
than
guernsey
a
little
after
eleven
the
captain
rectified
the
vessel
course
and
put
her
head
fair
for
guernsey
it
was
only
a
little
time
lost
but
in
short
days
time
lost
has
its
inconveniences
it
was
a
february
day
but
the
sun
shone
brightly
tangrouille
in
his
state
had
not
a
very
sure
arm
nor
a
very
firm
footing
the
result
was
that
the
helmsman
lurched
pretty
often
which
also
retarded
progress
the
wind
had
almost
entirely
fallen
the
guernsey
passenger
who
had
a
telescope
in
his
hand
brought
it
to
bear
from
time
to
time
upon
a
little
cloud
of
grey
mist
lightly
moved
by
the
wind
in
the
extreme
western
horizon
it
resembled
a
fleecy
down
sprinkled
with
dust
captain
clubin
wore
his
ordinary
austere
expression
of
countenance
he
appeared
to
redouble
his
attention
all
was
peaceful
and
almost
joyous
on
board
the
durande
the
passengers
chatted
it
is
possible
to
judge
of
the
state
of
the
sea
in
a
passage
with
the
eyes
closed
by
noting
the
of
the
conversation
about
you
the
full
freedom
of
mind
among
the
passengers
answers
to
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
the
waters
it
is
impossible
for
example
that
a
conversation
like
the
following
could
take
place
otherwise
than
on
a
very
calm
sea
observe
that
pretty
green
and
red
fly
it
has
lost
itself
out
at
sea
and
is
resting
on
the
ship
flies
do
not
soon
get
tired
no
doubt
they
are
light
the
wind
carries
them
an
ounce
of
flies
was
once
weighed
and
afterwards
counted
and
it
was
found
to
comprise
no
less
than
six
thousand
two
hundred
and
the
guernsey
passenger
with
the
telescope
had
approached
the
malo
cattle
dealers
and
their
talk
was
something
in
this
vein
the
aubrac
bull
has
a
round
and
thick
buttock
short
legs
and
a
yellowish
hide
he
is
slow
at
work
by
reason
of
the
shortness
of
his
legs
in
that
matter
the
salers
beats
the
aubrac
i
have
seen
sir
two
beautiful
bulls
in
my
life
the
first
has
the
legs
low
the
breast
thick
the
rump
full
the
haunches
large
a
good
length
of
neck
to
the
udder
withers
of
good
height
the
skin
easy
to
strip
the
second
had
all
the
signs
of
good
fattening
a
back
neck
and
shoulders
strong
coat
white
and
brown
rump
sinking
that
the
cotentin
race
yes
with
a
slight
cross
with
the
angus
or
suffolk
bull
you
may
believe
it
if
you
please
sir
but
i
assure
you
in
the
south
they
hold
shows
of
donkeys
shows
of
donkeys
of
donkeys
on
my
honour
and
the
ugliest
are
the
most
admired
ha
it
is
the
same
as
with
the
mule
shows
the
ugly
ones
are
considered
best
exactly
take
also
the
poitevin
mares
large
belly
thick
legs
the
best
mule
known
is
a
sort
of
barrel
upon
four
posts
beauty
in
beasts
is
a
different
thing
from
beauty
in
men
and
particularly
in
women
that
is
true
as
for
me
i
like
a
woman
to
be
pretty
i
am
more
particular
about
her
being
well
dressed
yes
neat
clean
and
well
set
off
looking
just
new
a
pretty
girl
ought
always
to
appear
as
if
she
had
just
been
turned
out
by
a
jeweller
to
return
to
my
bulls
i
saw
these
two
sold
at
the
market
at
thouars
the
market
at
thouars
i
know
it
very
well
the
bonneaus
of
la
rochelle
and
the
babas
corn
merchants
at
marans
i
do
know
whether
you
have
heard
of
them
attending
that
market
the
tourist
and
the
parisian
were
conversing
with
the
american
of
the
bibles
sir
said
the
tourist
i
will
tell
you
the
tonnage
of
the
civilised
world
france
tons
germany
the
united
states
england
add
the
small
vessels
total
tons
carried
in
vessels
scattered
over
the
waters
of
the
globe
the
american
interrupted
it
is
the
united
states
sir
which
have
i
agree
said
the
tourist
you
are
an
american
yes
sir
i
agree
again
there
was
a
pause
the
american
missionary
was
considering
whether
this
was
a
case
for
the
offer
of
a
bible
is
it
true
sir
asked
the
tourist
that
you
have
a
passion
for
nicknames
in
america
so
complete
that
you
confer
them
upon
all
your
celebrated
men
and
that
you
call
your
famous
missouri
banker
thomas
benton
lingot
yes
just
as
we
call
zachary
taylor
zach
and
general
harrison
tip
am
i
right
and
general
jackson
hickory
because
jackson
is
hard
as
hickory
wood
and
because
harrison
beat
the
redskins
at
it
is
an
odd
fashion
that
of
yours
it
is
our
custom
we
call
van
buren
little
wizard
seward
who
introduced
the
small
billy
and
douglas
the
democrat
senator
from
illinois
who
is
four
feet
high
and
very
eloquent
little
giant
you
may
go
from
texas
to
the
state
of
maine
without
hearing
the
name
of
cass
they
say
the
michiganer
nor
the
name
of
clay
they
say
miller
boy
with
the
scar
clay
is
the
son
of
a
miller
i
should
prefer
to
say
or
said
the
parisian
shorter
then
you
would
be
out
of
the
fashion
we
call
corwin
who
is
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
daniel
webster
dan
as
to
winfield
scott
as
his
first
thought
after
beating
the
english
at
chippeway
was
to
sit
down
to
dine
we
call
him
a
basin
of
soup
the
small
white
mist
perceived
in
the
distance
had
become
larger
it
filled
now
a
segment
of
fifteen
degrees
above
the
horizon
it
was
like
a
cloud
loitering
along
the
water
for
want
of
wind
to
stir
it
the
breeze
had
almost
entirely
died
away
the
sea
was
glassy
although
it
was
not
yet
noon
the
sun
was
becoming
pale
it
lighted
but
seemed
to
give
no
warmth
i
fancy
said
the
tourist
that
we
shall
have
a
change
of
weather
probably
rain
said
the
parisian
or
fog
said
the
american
in
italy
remarked
the
tourist
molfetta
is
the
place
where
there
falls
the
least
rain
and
tolmezzo
where
there
falls
the
most
at
noon
according
to
the
usage
of
the
channel
islands
the
bell
sounded
for
dinner
those
dined
who
desired
some
passengers
had
brought
with
them
provisions
and
were
eating
merrily
on
the
clubin
did
not
eat
while
this
eating
was
going
on
the
conversations
continued
the
guernsey
man
having
probably
a
scent
for
bibles
approached
the
american
the
latter
said
to
him
you
know
this
sea
very
well
i
belong
to
this
part
and
i
too
said
one
of
the
malo
men
the
native
of
guernsey
followed
with
a
bow
and
continued
we
are
fortunately
well
out
at
sea
now
i
should
not
have
liked
a
fog
when
we
were
off
the
minquiers
the
american
said
to
the
malo
man
islanders
are
more
at
home
on
the
sea
than
the
folks
of
the
coast
true
we
coast
people
are
only
half
dipped
in
salt
water
what
are
the
minquiers
asked
the
american
the
malo
man
replied
they
are
an
ugly
reef
of
rocks
there
are
also
the
grelets
said
the
guernsey
man
parblus
ejaculated
the
other
and
the
chouas
added
the
guernsey
man
the
inhabitant
of
malo
laughed
as
for
that
said
he
there
are
the
savages
also
and
the
monks
observed
the
guernsey
man
and
the
duck
cried
the
maloite
sir
remarked
the
inhabitant
of
guernsey
you
have
an
answer
for
everything
the
tourist
interposed
with
a
question
have
we
to
pass
all
that
legion
of
rocks
no
we
have
left
it
to
the
it
is
behind
us
and
the
guernsey
passenger
continued
big
and
little
rocks
together
the
grelets
have
peaks
and
the
minquiers
said
the
other
the
dialogue
was
now
confined
to
the
malo
and
the
guernsey
passenger
it
strikes
me
monsieur
malo
that
there
are
three
rocks
which
you
have
not
included
i
mentioned
all
from
the
derée
to
the
maître
ile
and
les
maisons
yes
seven
rocks
in
the
midst
of
the
minquiers
i
see
you
know
the
very
stones
if
i
did
know
the
stones
i
should
not
be
an
inhabitant
of
st
malo
it
is
amusing
to
hear
french
people
reasonings
the
malo
man
bowed
in
his
turn
and
said
the
savages
are
three
rocks
and
the
monks
two
and
the
duck
one
duck
this
is
only
one
of
course
no
for
suarde
consists
of
four
rocks
what
do
you
mean
by
the
suarde
asked
the
inhabitant
of
guernsey
we
call
the
suarde
what
you
call
the
chouas
it
is
a
queer
passage
that
between
the
chouas
and
the
duck
it
is
impassable
except
for
the
birds
and
the
fish
scarcely
in
bad
weather
they
give
themselves
hard
knocks
against
the
walls
there
is
sand
near
the
minquiers
around
the
maisons
there
are
eight
rocks
visible
from
jersey
visible
from
the
strand
of
azette
that
correct
but
not
eight
only
seven
at
low
water
you
can
walk
about
the
minquiers
no
doubt
there
would
be
sand
above
water
and
what
of
the
dirouilles
the
dirouilles
bear
no
resemblance
to
the
minquiers
they
are
very
dangerous
they
are
near
granville
i
see
that
you
malo
people
like
us
enjoy
sailing
in
these
seas
yes
replied
the
malo
man
with
the
difference
that
we
say
have
the
habit
you
are
fond
you
make
good
sailors
i
am
myself
a
cattle
merchant
who
was
that
famous
sailor
born
of
st
malo
surcouf
another
here
the
parisian
commercial
man
chimed
in
he
was
captured
by
the
english
he
was
as
agreeable
as
he
was
brave
a
young
english
lady
fell
in
love
with
him
it
was
she
who
procured
him
his
liberty
at
this
moment
a
voice
like
thunder
was
heard
crying
out
you
are
drunk
man
iv
captain
clubin
displays
all
his
great
qualities
everybody
turned
it
was
the
captain
calling
to
the
helmsman
sieur
clubin
tone
and
manner
evidenced
that
he
was
extremely
angry
or
that
he
wished
to
appear
so
a
burst
of
anger
sometimes
removes
responsibility
and
sometimes
shifts
it
on
to
other
shoulders
the
captain
standing
on
the
bridge
between
the
two
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
helmsman
he
repeated
between
his
teeth
drunkard
the
unlucky
tangrouille
hung
his
head
the
fog
had
made
progress
it
filled
by
this
time
nearly
of
the
horizon
it
seemed
to
advance
from
every
quarter
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
in
a
fog
of
the
nature
of
a
drop
of
oil
upon
the
water
it
enlarged
insensibly
the
light
wind
moved
it
onward
slowly
and
silently
by
little
and
little
it
took
possession
of
the
ocean
it
was
coming
chiefly
from
the
dead
ahead
the
ship
had
it
before
her
prow
like
a
line
of
cliff
moving
vast
and
vague
it
rose
from
the
sea
like
a
wall
there
was
an
exact
point
where
the
wide
waters
entered
the
fog
and
were
lost
to
sight
this
line
of
the
commencement
of
the
fog
was
still
above
distant
the
interval
was
visibly
growing
less
and
less
the
durande
made
way
the
fog
made
way
also
it
was
drawing
nearer
to
the
vessel
while
the
vessel
was
drawing
nearer
to
it
clubin
gave
the
order
to
put
on
more
steam
and
to
hold
off
the
coast
thus
for
some
time
they
skirted
the
edge
of
the
fog
but
still
it
advanced
the
vessel
meanwhile
sailed
in
broad
sunlight
time
was
lost
in
these
manoeuvres
which
had
little
chance
of
success
nightfall
comes
quickly
in
february
the
native
of
guernsey
was
meditating
upon
the
subject
of
this
fog
he
said
to
the
malo
men
it
will
be
thick
an
ugly
sort
of
weather
at
sea
observed
one
of
the
malo
men
the
other
added
a
kind
of
thing
which
spoils
a
good
passage
the
guernsey
passenger
approached
clubin
and
said
i
afraid
captain
that
the
fog
will
catch
us
clubin
replied
i
wished
to
stay
at
malo
but
i
was
advised
to
go
by
whom
by
some
old
sailors
you
were
certainly
right
to
go
said
the
guernsey
man
who
knows
whether
there
will
not
be
a
tempest
at
this
season
you
may
wait
and
find
it
worse
a
few
moments
later
the
durande
entered
the
fog
bank
the
effect
was
singular
suddenly
those
who
were
on
the
could
not
see
those
forward
a
soft
grey
medium
divided
the
ship
in
two
then
the
entire
vessel
passed
into
the
fog
the
sun
became
like
a
dull
red
moon
everybody
suddenly
shivered
the
passengers
put
on
their
overcoats
and
the
sailors
their
tarpaulins
the
sea
almost
without
a
ripple
was
the
more
menacing
from
its
cold
tranquillity
all
was
pale
and
wan
the
black
funnel
and
the
heavy
smoke
struggled
with
the
dewy
mist
which
enshrouded
the
vessel
dropping
to
westward
was
now
useless
the
captain
kept
the
vessel
head
again
towards
guernsey
and
gave
orders
to
put
on
the
steam
the
guernsey
passenger
hanging
about
the
hatchway
heard
the
negro
imbrancam
talking
to
his
engineer
comrade
the
passenger
listened
the
negro
said
this
morning
in
the
sun
we
were
going
half
steam
on
now
in
the
fog
we
put
on
steam
the
guernsey
man
returned
to
clubin
captain
clubin
a
is
useless
but
have
we
not
too
much
steam
on
what
can
i
do
sir
we
must
make
up
for
time
lost
through
the
fault
of
that
drunkard
of
a
helmsman
true
captain
clubin
and
clubin
added
i
am
anxious
to
arrive
it
is
foggy
enough
by
day
it
would
be
rather
too
much
at
night
the
guernsey
man
rejoined
his
malo
and
remarked
we
have
an
excellent
captain
at
intervals
great
waves
of
mist
bore
down
heavily
upon
them
and
blotted
out
the
sun
which
again
issued
out
of
them
pale
and
sickly
the
little
that
could
be
seen
of
the
heavens
resembled
the
long
strips
of
painted
sky
dirty
and
smeared
with
oil
among
the
old
scenery
of
a
theatre
the
durande
passed
close
to
a
cutter
which
had
cast
anchor
for
safety
it
was
the
of
guernsey
the
master
of
the
cutter
remarked
the
high
speed
of
the
it
struck
him
also
that
she
was
not
in
her
exact
course
she
seemed
to
him
to
bear
to
westward
too
much
the
apparition
of
this
vessel
under
full
steam
in
the
fog
surprised
him
towards
two
the
weather
had
become
so
thick
that
the
captain
was
obliged
to
leave
the
bridge
and
plant
himself
near
the
steersman
the
sun
had
vanished
and
all
was
fog
a
sort
of
ashy
darkness
surrounded
the
ship
they
were
navigating
in
a
pale
shroud
they
could
see
neither
sky
nor
water
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
can
of
turpentine
suspended
under
the
bridge
between
the
did
not
even
oscillate
the
passengers
had
become
silent
the
parisian
however
hummed
between
his
teeth
the
song
of
béranger
jour
le
bon
dieu
one
of
the
malo
passengers
addressed
him
you
are
from
paris
sir
yes
sir
mit
la
tête
à
la
what
do
they
do
in
paris
planète
a
péri
in
paris
sir
things
are
going
on
very
badly
then
it
the
same
ashore
as
at
sea
it
is
true
we
have
an
abominable
fog
here
one
which
might
involve
us
in
misfortunes
the
parisian
exclaimed
yes
and
why
all
these
misfortunes
in
the
world
misfortunes
what
are
they
sent
for
these
misfortunes
what
use
do
they
serve
there
was
the
fire
at
the
odéon
theatre
and
immediately
a
number
of
families
thrown
out
of
employment
is
that
just
i
do
know
what
is
your
religion
sir
but
i
am
puzzled
by
all
this
so
am
i
said
the
malo
man
everything
that
happens
here
below
continued
the
parisian
seems
to
go
wrong
it
looks
as
if
providence
for
some
reason
no
longer
watched
over
the
world
the
malo
man
scratched
the
top
of
his
head
like
one
making
an
effort
to
understand
the
parisian
continued
our
guardian
angel
seems
to
be
absent
there
ought
to
be
a
decree
against
celestial
absenteeism
he
is
at
his
and
takes
no
notice
of
us
so
all
gets
in
disorder
it
is
evident
that
this
guardian
is
not
in
the
government
he
is
taking
holiday
leaving
some
vicar
some
seminarist
angel
some
wretched
creature
with
to
look
after
affairs
captain
clubin
who
had
approached
the
speakers
during
this
conversation
laid
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
parisian
silence
sir
he
said
keep
a
watch
upon
your
words
we
are
upon
the
sea
no
one
spoke
again
aloud
after
a
pause
of
five
minutes
the
guernsey
man
who
had
heard
all
this
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
malo
passenger
a
religious
man
our
captain
it
did
not
rain
but
all
felt
their
clothing
wet
the
crew
took
no
heed
of
the
way
they
were
making
but
there
was
increased
sense
of
uneasiness
they
seemed
to
have
entered
into
a
doleful
region
the
fog
makes
a
deep
silence
on
the
sea
it
calms
the
waves
and
stifles
the
wind
in
the
midst
of
this
silence
the
creaking
of
the
durande
communicated
a
strange
indefinable
feeling
of
melancholy
and
disquietude
they
passed
no
more
vessels
if
afar
off
in
the
direction
of
guernsey
or
in
that
of
malo
any
vessels
were
at
sea
outside
the
fog
the
durande
submerged
in
the
dense
cloud
must
have
been
invisible
to
them
while
her
long
trail
of
smoke
attached
to
nothing
looked
like
a
black
comet
in
the
pale
sky
suddenly
clubin
roared
out
you
have
played
us
an
ugly
trick
you
will
have
done
us
some
damage
before
we
are
out
of
this
you
deserve
to
be
put
in
irons
get
you
gone
drunkard
and
he
seized
the
helm
himself
the
steersman
humbled
shrunk
away
to
take
part
in
the
duties
forward
the
guernsey
man
said
that
will
save
us
the
vessel
was
still
making
way
rapidly
towards
three
the
lower
part
of
the
fog
began
to
clear
and
they
could
see
the
sea
again
a
mist
can
only
be
dispersed
by
the
sun
or
the
wind
by
the
sun
is
well
by
the
wind
is
not
so
well
at
three
in
the
afternoon
in
the
month
of
february
the
sun
is
always
weak
a
return
of
the
wind
at
this
critical
point
in
a
voyage
is
not
desirable
it
is
often
the
forerunner
of
a
hurricane
if
there
was
any
breeze
however
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
clubin
with
his
eye
on
the
binnacle
holding
the
tiller
and
steering
muttered
to
himself
some
words
like
the
following
which
reached
the
ears
of
the
passengers
no
time
to
be
lost
that
drunken
rascal
has
retarded
us
his
visage
meanwhile
was
absolutely
without
expression
the
sea
was
less
calm
under
the
mist
a
few
waves
were
distinguishable
little
patches
of
light
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
water
these
luminous
patches
attract
the
attention
of
the
sailors
they
indicate
openings
made
by
the
wind
in
the
overhanging
roof
of
fog
the
cloud
rose
a
little
and
then
sunk
heavier
sometimes
the
density
was
perfect
the
ship
was
involved
in
a
sort
of
foggy
iceberg
at
intervals
this
terrible
circle
opened
a
little
like
a
pair
of
pincers
showed
a
glimpse
of
the
horizon
and
then
closed
again
meanwhile
the
guernsey
man
armed
with
his
spyglass
was
standing
like
a
sentinel
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
an
opening
appeared
for
a
moment
and
was
blotted
out
again
the
guernsey
man
returned
alarmed
captain
clubin
what
is
the
matter
we
are
steering
right
upon
the
hanways
you
are
mistaken
said
clubin
coldly
the
guernsey
man
insisted
i
am
sure
of
it
impossible
i
have
just
seen
the
rock
in
the
horizon
where
out
yonder
it
is
the
open
sea
there
impossible
and
clubin
kept
the
vessel
head
to
the
point
indicated
by
the
passenger
the
guernsey
man
seized
his
spyglass
again
a
moment
later
he
came
running
aft
again
captain
well
tack
about
why
i
am
certain
of
having
seen
a
very
high
rock
just
ahead
it
is
the
great
hanway
you
have
seen
nothing
but
a
thicker
bank
of
fog
it
is
the
great
hanway
tack
in
the
name
of
heaven
clubin
gave
the
helm
a
turn
v
clubin
reaches
the
of
glory
a
crash
was
heard
the
ripping
of
a
vessel
side
upon
a
sunken
reef
in
open
sea
is
the
most
dismal
sound
of
which
man
can
dream
the
course
was
stopped
short
several
passengers
were
knocked
down
with
the
shock
and
rolled
upon
the
deck
the
guernsey
man
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
we
are
on
the
hanways
i
predicted
it
a
long
cry
went
up
from
the
ship
we
are
lost
the
voice
of
clubin
dry
and
short
was
heard
above
all
no
one
is
lost
silence
the
black
form
of
imbrancam
naked
down
to
the
waist
issued
from
the
hatchway
of
the
the
negro
said
with
the
water
is
gaining
captain
the
fires
will
soon
be
out
the
moment
was
terrible
the
shock
was
like
that
of
a
suicide
if
the
disaster
had
been
wilfully
sought
it
could
not
have
been
more
terrible
the
durande
had
rushed
upon
her
fate
as
if
she
had
attacked
the
rock
itself
a
point
had
pierced
her
sides
like
a
wedge
more
than
six
feet
square
of
planking
had
gone
the
stem
was
broken
the
prow
smashed
and
the
gaping
hull
drank
in
the
sea
with
a
horrible
gulping
noise
it
was
an
entrance
for
wreck
and
ruin
the
rebound
was
so
violent
that
it
had
shattered
the
rudder
pendants
the
rudder
itself
hung
unhinged
and
flapping
the
rock
had
driven
in
her
keel
round
about
the
vessel
nothing
was
visible
except
a
thick
compact
fog
now
become
sombre
night
was
gathering
fast
the
durande
plunged
forward
it
was
like
the
effort
of
a
horse
pierced
through
the
entrails
by
the
horns
of
a
bull
all
was
over
with
her
tangrouille
was
sobered
nobody
is
drunk
in
the
moment
of
a
shipwreck
he
came
down
to
the
went
up
again
and
said
captain
the
water
is
gaining
rapidly
in
the
hold
in
ten
minutes
it
will
be
up
to
the
the
passengers
ran
about
bewildered
wringing
their
hands
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
looking
down
in
the
and
making
every
other
sort
of
useless
movement
in
their
terror
the
tourist
had
fainted
clubin
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
they
were
silent
he
questioned
imbrancam
how
long
will
the
engines
work
yet
five
or
six
minutes
sir
then
he
interrogated
the
guernsey
passenger
i
was
at
the
helm
you
saw
the
rock
on
which
bank
of
the
hanways
are
we
on
the
mauve
just
now
in
the
opening
in
the
fog
i
saw
it
clearly
if
we
on
the
mauve
remarked
clubin
we
have
the
great
hanway
on
the
port
side
and
the
little
hanway
on
the
starboard
bow
we
are
a
mile
from
the
shore
the
crew
and
passengers
listened
fixing
their
eyes
anxiously
and
attentively
on
the
captain
lightening
the
ship
would
have
been
of
no
avail
and
indeed
would
have
been
hardly
possible
in
order
to
throw
the
cargo
overboard
they
would
have
had
to
open
the
ports
and
increase
the
chance
of
the
water
entering
to
cast
anchor
would
have
been
equally
useless
they
were
stuck
fast
besides
with
such
a
bottom
for
the
anchor
to
drag
the
chain
would
probably
have
fouled
the
engines
not
being
injured
and
being
workable
while
the
fires
were
not
extinguished
that
is
to
say
for
a
few
minutes
longer
they
could
have
made
an
effort
by
help
of
steam
and
her
paddles
to
turn
her
astern
off
the
rocks
but
if
they
had
succeeded
they
must
have
settled
down
immediately
the
rock
indeed
in
some
degree
stopped
the
breach
and
prevented
the
entrance
of
the
water
it
was
at
least
an
obstacle
while
the
hole
once
freed
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
stop
the
leak
or
to
work
the
pumps
to
snatch
a
poniard
from
a
wound
in
the
heart
is
instant
death
to
the
victim
to
free
the
vessel
from
the
rock
would
have
been
simply
to
founder
the
cattle
on
whom
the
water
was
gaining
in
the
hold
were
lowing
piteously
clubin
issued
orders
launch
the
long
boat
imbrancam
and
tangrouille
rushed
to
execute
the
order
the
boat
was
eased
from
her
fastenings
the
rest
of
the
crew
looked
on
stupefied
all
hands
to
assist
cried
clubin
this
time
all
obeyed
clubin
continued
to
issue
his
orders
in
that
old
sea
dialect
which
french
sailors
of
the
present
day
would
scarcely
understand
haul
in
a
rope
get
a
cable
if
the
capstan
does
not
work
stop
heaving
keep
the
blocks
clear
lower
away
there
bring
her
down
stern
and
bows
now
then
all
together
lads
take
care
she
do
lower
stern
first
there
too
much
strain
on
there
hold
the
laniard
of
the
stock
tackle
stand
by
there
the
long
boat
was
launched
at
that
instant
the
durande
paddles
stopped
and
the
smoke
ceased
the
fires
were
drowned
the
passengers
slipped
down
the
ladder
and
dropped
hurriedly
into
the
long
boat
imbrancam
lifted
the
fainting
tourist
carried
him
into
the
boat
and
then
boarded
the
vessel
again
the
crew
made
a
rush
after
the
passengers
the
cabin
boy
was
knocked
down
and
the
others
were
trampling
upon
him
imbrancam
barred
their
passage
not
a
man
before
the
lad
he
said
he
kept
off
the
sailors
with
his
two
black
arms
picked
up
the
boy
and
handed
him
down
to
the
guernsey
man
who
was
standing
upright
in
the
boat
the
boy
saved
imbrancam
made
way
for
the
others
and
said
pass
on
meanwhile
clubin
had
entered
his
cabin
and
had
made
up
a
parcel
containing
the
ship
papers
and
instruments
he
took
the
compass
from
the
binnacle
handed
the
papers
and
instruments
to
imbrancam
and
the
compass
to
tangrouille
and
said
to
them
get
aboard
the
boat
they
obeyed
the
crew
had
taken
their
places
before
them
now
cried
clubin
push
off
a
cry
arose
from
the
long
boat
what
about
yourself
captain
i
will
remain
here
shipwrecked
people
have
little
time
to
deliberate
and
not
much
for
indulging
in
tender
feeling
those
who
were
in
the
long
boat
and
in
comparative
safety
however
felt
an
emotion
which
was
not
altogether
selfish
all
the
voices
shouted
together
come
with
us
captain
no
i
remain
here
the
guernsey
man
who
had
some
experience
of
the
sea
replied
listen
to
me
captain
you
are
wrecked
on
the
hanways
swimming
you
would
have
only
a
mile
to
cross
to
pleinmont
in
a
boat
you
can
only
land
at
rocquaine
which
is
two
miles
there
are
breakers
and
there
is
the
fog
our
boat
will
not
get
to
rocquaine
in
less
than
two
hours
it
will
be
a
dark
night
the
sea
is
rising
the
wind
getting
fresh
a
squall
is
at
hand
we
are
now
ready
to
return
and
bring
you
off
but
if
bad
weather
comes
on
that
will
be
out
of
our
power
you
are
lost
if
you
stay
there
come
with
us
the
parisian
chimed
in
the
long
boat
is
full
too
full
it
is
true
and
one
more
will
certainly
be
one
too
many
but
we
are
thirteen
a
bad
number
for
the
boat
and
it
is
better
to
overload
her
with
a
man
than
to
take
an
ominous
number
come
captain
tangrouille
added
it
was
all
my
fault
not
yours
captain
it
is
fair
for
you
to
be
left
behind
i
have
decided
to
remain
here
said
clubin
the
vessel
must
inevitably
go
to
pieces
in
the
tempest
i
wo
leave
her
when
the
ship
is
lost
the
captain
is
already
dead
people
shall
not
say
i
did
do
my
duty
to
the
end
tangrouille
i
forgive
you
then
folding
his
arms
he
cried
obey
orders
let
go
the
rope
and
push
off
the
swayed
to
and
fro
imbrancam
had
seized
the
tiller
all
the
hands
which
were
not
rowing
were
raised
towards
the
captain
every
mouth
cried
cheers
for
captain
clubin
an
admirable
fellow
said
the
american
sir
replied
the
guernsey
man
he
is
one
of
the
worthiest
seamen
afloat
tangrouille
shed
tears
if
i
had
had
the
courage
he
said
i
would
have
stayed
with
him
the
pushed
away
and
was
lost
in
the
fog
nothing
more
was
visible
the
beat
of
the
oars
grew
fainter
and
died
away
clubin
remained
alone
vi
the
interior
of
an
abyss
suddenly
revealed
when
clubin
found
himself
upon
this
rock
in
the
midst
of
the
fog
and
the
wide
waters
far
from
all
sound
of
human
life
left
for
dead
alone
with
the
tide
rising
around
him
and
night
settling
down
rapidly
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
profound
satisfaction
he
had
succeeded
his
dream
was
realised
the
acceptance
which
he
had
drawn
upon
destiny
at
so
long
a
date
had
fallen
due
at
last
with
him
to
be
abandoned
there
was
in
fact
to
be
saved
he
was
on
the
hanways
one
mile
from
the
shore
he
had
about
him
thousand
francs
never
was
shipwreck
more
scientifically
accomplished
nothing
had
failed
it
is
true
everything
had
been
foreseen
from
his
early
years
clubin
had
had
an
idea
to
stake
his
reputation
for
honesty
at
life
to
pass
as
a
man
of
high
honour
and
to
make
that
reputation
his
fulcrum
for
other
things
to
bide
his
time
to
watch
his
opportunity
not
to
grope
about
blindly
but
to
seize
boldly
to
venture
on
one
great
stroke
only
one
and
to
end
by
sweeping
off
the
stakes
leaving
fools
behind
him
to
gape
and
wonder
what
stupid
rogues
fail
in
twenty
times
he
meant
to
accomplish
at
the
first
blow
and
while
they
terminated
a
career
on
the
gallows
he
intended
to
finish
with
a
fortune
the
meeting
with
rantaine
had
been
a
new
light
to
him
he
had
immediately
laid
his
plan
to
compel
rantaine
to
disgorge
to
frustrate
his
threatened
revelations
by
disappearing
to
make
the
world
believe
him
dead
the
best
of
all
modes
of
concealment
and
for
this
purpose
to
wreck
the
durande
the
shipwreck
was
necessary
to
his
designs
lastly
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
vanishing
leaving
behind
him
a
great
renown
the
crowning
point
of
his
existence
as
he
stood
meditating
on
these
things
amid
the
wreck
clubin
might
have
been
taken
for
some
demon
in
a
pleasant
mood
he
had
lived
a
lifetime
for
the
sake
of
this
one
minute
his
whole
exterior
was
expressive
of
the
two
words
at
last
a
devilish
tranquillity
reigned
in
that
sallow
countenance
his
dull
eye
the
depth
of
which
generally
seemed
to
be
impenetrable
became
clear
and
terrible
the
inward
fire
of
his
dark
spirit
was
reflected
there
man
inner
nature
like
that
external
world
about
him
has
its
electric
phenomena
an
idea
is
like
a
meteor
at
the
moment
of
its
coming
the
confused
meditations
which
preceded
it
open
a
way
and
a
spark
flashes
forth
bearing
within
oneself
a
power
of
evil
feeling
an
inward
prey
brings
to
some
minds
a
pleasure
which
is
like
a
sparkle
of
light
the
triumph
of
an
evil
purpose
brightens
up
their
visages
the
success
of
certain
cunning
combinations
the
attainment
of
certain
cherished
objects
the
gratification
of
certain
ferocious
instincts
will
manifest
themselves
in
sinister
but
luminous
appearances
in
their
eyes
it
is
like
a
threatening
dawn
a
gleam
of
joy
drawn
out
of
the
heart
of
a
storm
these
flashes
are
generated
in
the
conscience
in
its
states
of
cloud
and
darkness
some
such
signs
were
then
exhibiting
themselves
in
the
pupils
of
those
eyes
they
were
like
nothing
else
that
can
be
seen
shining
either
above
or
here
below
all
clubin
wickedness
found
full
vent
now
he
gazed
into
the
vast
surrounding
darkness
and
indulged
in
a
low
irrepressible
laugh
full
of
sinister
significance
he
was
rich
at
last
rich
at
last
the
unknown
future
of
his
life
was
at
length
unfolding
the
problem
was
solved
clubin
had
plenty
of
time
before
him
the
sea
was
rising
and
consequently
sustained
the
durande
and
even
raised
her
at
last
a
little
the
vessel
kept
firmly
in
its
place
among
the
rocks
there
was
no
danger
of
her
foundering
besides
he
determined
to
give
the
time
to
get
clear
off
to
go
to
the
bottom
perhaps
clubin
hoped
it
might
erect
upon
the
deck
of
the
shipwrecked
vessel
he
folded
his
arms
apparently
enjoying
that
forlorn
situation
in
the
dark
night
hypocrisy
had
weighed
upon
this
man
for
thirty
years
he
had
been
evil
itself
yoked
with
probity
for
a
mate
he
detested
virtue
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
has
been
trapped
into
a
hateful
match
he
had
always
had
a
wicked
premeditation
from
the
time
when
he
attained
manhood
he
had
worn
the
cold
and
rigid
armour
of
appearances
underneath
this
was
the
demon
of
self
he
had
lived
like
a
bandit
in
the
disguise
of
an
honest
citizen
he
had
been
the
pirate
the
of
honesty
he
had
been
confined
in
garments
of
innocence
as
in
oppressive
mummy
cloths
had
worn
those
angel
wings
which
the
devils
find
so
wearisome
in
their
fallen
state
he
had
been
overloaded
with
public
esteem
it
is
arduous
passing
for
a
shining
light
to
preserve
a
perpetual
equilibrium
amid
these
difficulties
to
think
evil
to
speak
goodness
here
had
been
indeed
a
labour
such
a
life
of
contradictions
had
been
clubin
fate
it
had
been
his
lot
not
the
less
onerous
because
he
had
chosen
it
himself
to
preserve
a
good
exterior
to
be
always
presentable
to
foam
in
secret
to
smile
while
grinding
his
teeth
virtue
presented
itself
to
his
mind
as
something
stifling
he
had
felt
sometimes
as
if
he
could
have
gnawed
those
which
he
was
compelled
to
keep
before
his
mouth
to
live
a
life
which
is
a
perpetual
falsehood
is
to
suffer
unknown
tortures
to
be
premeditating
indefinitely
a
diabolical
act
to
have
to
assume
austerity
to
brood
over
secret
infamy
seasoned
with
outward
good
fame
to
have
continually
to
put
the
world
off
the
scent
to
present
a
perpetual
illusion
and
never
to
be
one
self
is
a
burdensome
task
to
be
constrained
to
dip
the
brush
in
that
dark
stuff
within
to
produce
with
it
a
portrait
of
candour
to
fawn
to
restrain
and
suppress
self
to
be
ever
on
the
watching
without
ceasing
to
mask
latent
crimes
with
a
face
of
healthy
innocence
to
transform
deformity
into
beauty
to
fashion
wickedness
into
the
shape
of
perfection
to
tickle
as
it
were
with
the
point
of
a
dagger
to
put
sugar
with
poison
to
keep
a
bridle
on
every
gesture
and
keep
a
watch
over
every
tone
not
even
to
have
a
countenance
of
one
own
what
can
be
harder
what
can
be
more
torturing
the
odiousness
of
hypocrisy
is
obscurely
felt
by
the
hypocrite
himself
drinking
perpetually
of
his
own
imposture
is
nauseating
the
sweetness
of
tone
which
cunning
gives
to
scoundrelism
is
repugnant
to
the
scoundrel
compelled
to
have
it
ever
in
the
mouth
and
there
are
moments
of
disgust
when
villainy
seems
on
the
point
of
vomiting
its
secret
to
have
to
swallow
that
bitter
saliva
is
horrible
add
to
this
picture
his
profound
pride
there
are
strange
moments
in
the
history
of
such
a
life
when
hypocrisy
worships
itself
there
is
always
an
inordinate
egotism
in
roguery
the
worm
has
the
same
mode
of
gliding
along
as
the
serpent
and
the
same
manner
of
raising
its
head
the
treacherous
villain
is
the
despot
curbed
and
restrained
and
only
able
to
attain
his
ends
by
resigning
himself
to
play
a
secondary
part
he
is
littleness
capable
of
enormities
the
perfect
hypocrite
is
a
titan
dwarfed
clubin
had
a
genuine
faith
that
he
had
been
why
had
not
he
the
right
to
have
been
born
rich
it
was
from
no
fault
of
his
that
it
was
otherwise
deprived
as
he
had
been
of
the
higher
enjoyments
of
life
why
had
he
been
forced
to
labour
in
other
words
to
cheat
to
betray
to
destroy
why
had
he
been
condemned
to
this
torture
of
flattering
cringing
fawning
to
be
always
labouring
for
men
respect
and
friendship
and
to
wear
night
and
day
a
face
which
was
not
his
own
to
be
compelled
to
dissimulate
was
in
itself
to
submit
to
a
hardship
men
hate
those
to
whom
they
have
to
lie
but
now
the
disguise
was
at
an
end
clubin
had
taken
his
revenge
on
whom
on
all
on
everything
lethierry
had
never
done
him
any
but
good
services
so
much
the
greater
his
spleen
he
was
revenged
upon
lethierry
he
was
revenged
upon
all
those
in
whose
presence
he
had
felt
constraint
it
was
his
turn
to
be
free
now
whoever
had
thought
well
of
him
was
his
enemy
he
had
felt
himself
their
captive
long
enough
now
he
had
broken
through
his
prison
walls
his
escape
was
accomplished
that
which
would
be
regarded
as
his
death
would
be
in
fact
the
beginning
of
his
life
he
was
about
to
begin
the
world
again
the
true
clubin
had
stripped
off
the
false
in
one
hour
the
spell
was
broken
he
had
kicked
rantaine
into
space
overwhelmed
lethierry
in
ruin
human
justice
in
night
and
opinion
in
error
he
had
cast
off
all
humanity
blotted
out
the
whole
world
the
name
of
god
that
word
of
three
letters
occupied
his
mind
but
little
he
had
passed
for
a
religious
man
what
was
he
now
there
are
secret
recesses
in
hypocrisy
or
rather
the
hypocrite
is
himself
a
secret
recess
when
clubin
found
himself
quite
alone
that
cavern
in
which
his
soul
had
so
long
lain
hidden
was
opened
he
enjoyed
a
moment
of
delicious
liberty
he
revelled
for
that
moment
in
the
open
air
he
gave
vent
to
himself
in
one
long
breath
the
depth
of
evil
within
him
revealed
itself
in
his
visage
he
expanded
as
it
were
with
diabolical
joy
the
features
of
rantaine
by
the
side
of
his
at
that
moment
would
have
shown
like
the
innocent
expression
of
a
child
what
a
deliverance
was
this
plucking
off
of
the
old
mask
his
conscience
rejoiced
in
the
sight
of
its
own
monstrous
nakedness
as
it
stepped
forth
to
take
its
hideous
bath
of
wickedness
the
long
restraint
of
men
respect
seemed
to
have
given
him
a
peculiar
relish
for
infamy
he
experienced
a
certain
lascivious
enjoyment
of
wickedness
in
those
frightful
moral
abysses
so
rarely
sounded
such
natures
find
atrocious
delights
they
are
the
obscenities
of
rascality
the
insipidity
of
the
false
reputation
for
virtue
gave
him
a
sort
of
appetite
for
shame
in
this
state
of
mind
men
disdain
their
fellows
so
much
that
they
even
long
for
the
contempt
which
marks
the
ending
of
their
unmerited
homage
they
feel
a
satisfaction
in
the
freedom
of
degradation
and
cast
an
eye
of
envy
at
baseness
sitting
at
its
ease
clothed
in
ignominy
and
shame
eyes
that
are
forced
to
droop
modestly
are
familiar
with
these
stealthy
glances
at
sin
from
messalina
to
the
distance
is
not
great
remember
the
histories
of
la
cadière
and
the
nun
of
louviers
clubin
too
had
worn
the
veil
effrontery
had
always
been
the
object
of
his
secret
admiration
he
envied
the
painted
courtesan
and
the
face
of
bronze
of
the
professional
ruffian
he
felt
a
pride
in
surpassing
her
in
artifices
and
a
disgust
for
the
trick
of
passing
for
a
saint
he
had
been
the
tantalus
of
cynicism
and
now
upon
this
rock
in
the
midst
of
this
solitude
he
could
be
frank
and
open
a
bold
plunge
into
wickedness
what
a
voluptuous
sense
of
relief
it
brought
with
it
all
the
delights
known
to
the
fallen
angels
are
summed
up
in
this
and
clubin
felt
them
in
that
moment
the
long
arrears
of
dissimulations
were
paid
at
last
hypocrisy
is
an
investment
the
devil
reimburses
it
clubin
gave
himself
up
to
the
intoxication
of
the
idea
having
no
longer
any
eye
upon
him
but
that
of
heaven
he
whispered
within
himself
i
am
a
scoundrel
and
felt
profoundly
satisfied
never
had
human
conscience
experienced
such
a
full
tide
of
emotions
he
was
glad
to
be
entirely
alone
and
yet
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
have
had
some
one
there
he
would
have
been
pleased
to
have
had
a
witness
of
his
fiendish
joy
gratified
to
have
had
opportunity
of
saying
to
society
thou
fool
the
solitude
indeed
assured
his
triumph
but
it
made
it
less
he
was
not
himself
to
be
spectator
of
his
glory
even
to
be
in
the
pillory
has
its
satisfaction
for
everybody
can
see
your
infamy
to
compel
the
crowd
to
stand
and
gape
is
in
fact
an
exercise
of
power
a
malefactor
standing
upon
a
platform
in
the
with
the
collar
of
iron
around
his
neck
is
master
of
all
the
glances
which
he
constrains
the
multitude
to
turn
towards
him
there
is
a
pedestal
on
yonder
scaffolding
to
be
there
the
centre
of
universal
observation
is
not
this
too
a
triumph
to
direct
the
pupil
of
the
public
eye
is
this
not
another
form
of
supremacy
for
those
who
worship
an
ideal
wickedness
opprobrium
is
glory
it
is
a
height
from
whence
they
can
look
down
a
superiority
at
least
of
some
kind
a
in
which
they
can
display
themselves
royally
a
gallows
standing
high
in
the
gaze
of
all
the
world
is
not
without
some
analogy
with
a
throne
to
be
exposed
is
at
least
to
be
seen
and
studied
herein
we
have
evidently
the
key
to
the
wicked
reigns
of
history
nero
burning
rome
louis
quatorze
treacherously
seizing
the
palatinate
the
prince
regent
killing
napoleon
slowly
nicholas
strangling
poland
before
the
eyes
of
the
civilised
world
may
have
felt
something
akin
to
clubin
joy
universal
execration
derives
a
grandeur
even
from
its
vastness
to
be
unmasked
is
a
humiliation
but
to
unmask
one
self
is
a
triumph
there
is
an
intoxication
in
the
position
an
insolent
satisfaction
in
its
contempt
for
appearances
a
flaunting
insolence
in
the
nakedness
with
which
it
affronts
the
decencies
of
life
these
ideas
in
a
hypocrite
appear
to
be
inconsistent
but
in
reality
are
not
all
infamy
is
logical
honey
is
gall
a
character
like
that
of
escobar
has
some
affinity
with
that
of
the
marquis
de
sade
in
proof
we
have
léotade
a
hypocrite
being
a
personification
of
vice
complete
includes
in
himself
the
two
poles
of
perversity
on
one
side
he
resembles
the
courtesan
on
the
other
the
sex
of
his
diabolical
nature
is
double
it
engenders
and
transforms
itself
would
you
see
it
in
its
pleasing
shape
look
at
it
would
you
see
it
horrible
turn
it
round
all
this
multitude
of
ideas
was
floating
confusedly
in
clubin
mind
he
analysed
them
little
but
he
felt
them
much
a
whirlwind
of
flakes
of
fire
borne
up
from
the
pit
of
hell
into
the
dark
night
might
fitly
represent
the
wild
succession
of
ideas
in
his
soul
clubin
remained
thus
some
time
pensive
and
motionless
he
looked
down
upon
his
virtues
as
a
serpent
on
its
old
skin
everybody
had
had
faith
in
that
virtue
even
he
himself
a
little
he
laughed
again
society
would
imagine
him
dead
while
he
was
rich
they
would
believe
him
drowned
while
he
was
saved
what
a
capital
trick
to
have
played
off
on
the
stupidity
of
the
world
rantaine
too
was
included
in
that
universal
stupidity
clubin
thought
of
rantaine
with
an
unmeasured
disdain
the
disdain
of
the
marten
for
the
tiger
the
trick
had
failed
with
rantaine
it
had
succeeded
with
rantaine
had
slunk
away
abashed
clubin
disappeared
in
triumph
he
had
substituted
himself
for
rantaine
stepped
between
him
and
his
mistress
and
carried
off
her
favours
as
to
the
future
he
had
no
plan
in
the
iron
in
his
girdle
he
had
the
three
the
knowledge
of
that
fact
was
enough
he
would
change
his
name
there
are
plenty
of
countries
where
sixty
thousand
francs
are
equal
to
six
hundred
thousand
it
would
be
no
bad
solution
to
go
to
one
of
those
corners
of
the
world
and
live
there
honestly
on
the
money
disgorged
by
that
scoundrel
rantaine
to
speculate
to
embark
in
commerce
to
increase
his
capital
to
become
really
a
millionaire
that
too
would
be
no
bad
termination
to
his
career
for
example
the
great
trade
in
coffee
from
costa
rica
was
just
beginning
to
be
developed
there
were
heaps
of
gold
to
be
made
he
would
see
it
was
of
little
consequence
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
of
it
the
hardest
part
of
the
enterprise
was
accomplished
stripping
rantaine
and
disappearing
with
the
wreck
of
the
durande
were
the
grand
achievements
all
the
rest
was
for
him
simple
no
obstacle
henceforth
was
likely
to
stop
him
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
he
could
reach
the
shore
with
certainty
by
swimming
he
would
land
at
pleinmont
in
the
darkness
ascend
the
cliffs
go
straight
to
the
old
haunted
house
enter
it
easily
by
the
help
of
the
knotted
cord
concealed
beforehand
in
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
would
find
in
the
house
his
containing
provisions
and
dry
clothing
there
he
could
await
his
opportunity
he
had
information
a
week
would
not
pass
without
the
spanish
smugglers
blasquito
probably
touching
at
pleinmont
for
a
few
guineas
he
would
obtain
a
passage
not
to
torbay
as
he
had
said
to
blasco
to
confound
conjecture
and
put
him
off
the
scent
but
to
bilbao
or
passages
thence
he
could
get
to
vera
cruz
or
new
orleans
but
the
moment
had
come
for
taking
to
the
water
the
long
boat
was
far
enough
by
this
time
an
hour
swimming
was
nothing
for
clubin
the
distance
of
a
mile
only
separated
him
from
the
land
as
he
was
on
the
hanways
at
this
point
in
clubin
meditations
a
clear
opening
appeared
in
the
fog
bank
the
formidable
douvres
rocks
stood
before
him
vii
an
unexpected
denouement
clubin
haggard
stared
straight
ahead
it
was
indeed
those
terrible
and
solitary
rocks
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
their
misshapen
outlines
the
two
twin
douvres
reared
their
forms
aloft
hideously
revealing
the
passage
between
them
like
a
snare
a
in
ambush
in
the
ocean
they
were
quite
close
to
him
the
fog
like
an
artful
accomplice
had
hidden
them
until
now
clubin
had
mistaken
his
course
in
the
dense
mist
notwithstanding
all
his
pains
he
had
experienced
the
fate
of
two
other
great
navigators
gonzalez
who
discovered
cape
blanco
and
fernandez
who
discovered
cape
verd
the
fog
had
bewildered
him
it
had
seemed
to
him
in
the
confidence
of
his
seamanship
to
favour
admirably
the
execution
of
his
project
but
it
had
its
perils
in
veering
to
westward
he
had
lost
his
reckoning
the
guernsey
man
who
fancied
that
he
recognised
the
hanways
had
decided
his
fate
and
determined
him
to
give
the
final
turn
to
the
tiller
clubin
had
never
doubted
that
he
had
steered
the
vessel
on
the
hanways
the
durande
stove
in
by
one
of
the
sunken
rocks
of
the
group
was
only
separated
from
the
two
douvres
by
a
few
cables
lengths
at
two
hundred
fathoms
further
was
a
massive
block
of
granite
upon
the
steep
sides
of
this
rock
were
some
hollows
and
small
projections
which
might
help
a
man
to
climb
the
square
corners
of
those
rude
walls
at
right
angles
indicated
the
existence
of
a
plateau
on
the
summit
it
was
the
height
known
by
the
name
of
the
man
the
man
rock
rose
even
higher
still
than
the
douvres
its
platform
commanded
a
view
over
their
two
inaccessible
peaks
this
platform
crumbling
at
its
edges
had
every
kind
of
irregularity
of
shape
no
place
more
desolate
or
more
dangerous
could
be
imagined
the
hardly
perceptible
waves
of
the
open
sea
lapped
gently
against
the
square
sides
of
that
dark
enormous
mass
a
sort
of
for
the
vast
spectres
of
the
sea
and
darkness
all
around
was
calm
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
or
a
ripple
the
mind
guessed
darkly
the
hidden
life
and
vastness
of
the
depths
beneath
that
quiet
surface
clubin
had
often
seen
the
douvres
from
afar
he
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
indeed
there
he
could
not
doubt
it
a
sudden
and
hideous
change
of
affairs
the
douvres
instead
of
the
hanways
instead
of
one
mile
five
leagues
of
sea
the
douvres
to
the
solitary
shipwrecked
sailor
is
the
visible
and
palpable
presence
of
death
the
extinction
of
all
hope
of
reaching
land
clubin
shuddered
he
had
placed
himself
voluntarily
in
the
jaws
of
destruction
no
other
refuge
was
left
to
him
than
the
man
rock
it
was
probable
that
a
tempest
would
arise
in
the
night
and
that
the
overloaded
as
she
was
would
sink
no
news
of
the
shipwreck
then
would
come
to
land
it
would
not
even
be
known
that
clubin
had
been
left
upon
the
douvres
no
prospect
was
now
before
him
but
death
from
cold
and
hunger
his
thousand
francs
would
not
purchase
him
a
mouthful
of
bread
all
the
scaffolding
he
had
built
up
had
brought
him
only
to
this
snare
he
alone
was
the
laborious
architect
of
this
crowning
catastrophe
no
resource
no
possible
escape
his
triumph
transformed
into
a
fatal
precipice
instead
of
deliverance
a
prison
instead
of
the
long
prosperous
future
agony
in
the
glance
of
an
eye
in
the
moment
which
the
lightning
occupies
in
passing
all
his
construction
had
fallen
into
ruins
the
paradise
dreamed
of
by
this
demon
had
changed
to
its
true
form
of
a
sepulchre
meanwhile
there
had
sprung
up
a
movement
in
the
air
the
wind
was
rising
the
fog
shaken
driven
in
and
rent
asunder
moved
towards
the
horizon
in
vast
shapeless
masses
as
quickly
as
it
had
disappeared
before
the
sea
became
once
more
visible
the
cattle
more
and
more
invaded
by
the
waters
continued
to
bellow
in
the
hold
night
was
approaching
probably
bringing
with
it
a
storm
the
durande
filling
slowly
with
the
rising
tide
swung
from
right
to
left
then
from
left
to
right
and
began
to
turn
upon
the
rock
as
upon
a
pivot
the
moment
could
be
foreseen
when
a
wave
must
move
her
from
her
fixed
position
and
probably
roll
her
over
on
her
it
was
not
even
so
dark
as
at
the
instant
of
her
striking
the
rocks
though
the
day
was
more
advanced
it
was
possible
to
see
more
clearly
the
fog
had
carried
away
with
it
some
part
of
the
darkness
the
west
was
without
a
cloud
twilight
brings
a
pale
sky
its
vast
reflection
glimmered
on
the
sea
the
durande
bows
were
lower
than
her
stern
her
stern
was
in
fact
almost
out
of
the
water
clubin
mounted
on
the
taffrail
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
horizon
it
is
the
nature
of
hypocrisy
to
be
sanguine
the
hypocrite
is
one
who
waits
his
opportunity
hypocrisy
is
nothing
in
fact
but
a
horrible
hopefulness
the
very
foundation
of
its
revolting
falsehood
is
composed
of
that
virtue
transformed
into
a
vice
strange
contradiction
there
is
a
certain
trustfulness
in
hypocrisy
the
hypocrite
confides
in
some
power
unrevealed
even
to
himself
which
permits
the
course
of
evil
clubin
looked
far
and
wide
over
the
ocean
the
position
was
desperate
but
that
evil
spirit
did
not
yet
despair
he
knew
that
after
the
fog
vessels
that
had
been
or
riding
at
anchor
would
resume
their
course
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
one
would
pass
within
the
horizon
and
as
he
had
anticipated
a
sail
appeared
she
was
coming
from
the
east
and
steering
towards
the
west
as
it
approached
the
cut
of
the
vessel
became
visible
it
had
but
one
mast
and
was
her
bowsprit
was
almost
horizontal
it
was
a
cutter
before
a
she
must
pass
not
very
far
from
the
douvres
clubin
said
within
himself
i
am
saved
in
a
moment
like
this
a
man
thinks
at
first
of
nothing
but
his
life
the
cutter
was
probably
a
strange
craft
might
it
not
be
one
of
the
smuggling
vessels
on
its
way
to
pleinmont
it
might
even
be
blasquito
himself
in
that
case
not
only
life
but
fortune
would
be
saved
and
the
accident
of
the
douvres
by
hastening
the
conclusion
by
dispensing
with
the
necessity
for
concealment
in
the
haunted
house
and
by
bringing
the
adventure
to
a
dénouement
at
sea
would
be
turned
into
a
happy
incident
all
his
original
confidence
of
success
returned
fanatically
to
his
sombre
mind
it
is
remarkable
how
easily
knaves
are
persuaded
that
they
deserve
to
succeed
there
was
but
one
course
to
take
the
durande
entangled
among
the
rocks
necessarily
mingled
her
outline
with
them
and
confounded
herself
with
their
irregular
shapes
among
which
she
formed
only
one
more
mass
of
lines
thus
become
indistinct
and
lost
she
would
not
suffice
in
the
little
light
which
remained
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel
which
was
approaching
but
a
human
form
standing
up
black
against
the
pale
twilight
of
the
sky
upon
the
man
rock
and
making
signs
of
distress
would
doubtless
be
perceived
and
the
cutter
would
then
send
a
boat
to
take
the
shipwrecked
man
aboard
the
man
was
only
two
hundred
fathoms
off
to
reach
it
by
swimming
was
simple
to
climb
it
easy
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
the
bows
of
the
durande
being
low
between
the
rocks
it
was
from
the
height
of
the
poop
where
clubin
stood
that
he
had
to
jump
into
the
sea
he
began
by
taking
a
sounding
and
discovered
that
there
was
great
depth
just
under
the
stern
of
the
wrecked
vessel
the
microscopic
shells
of
foraminifera
which
the
adhesive
matter
on
the
brought
up
were
intact
indicating
the
presence
of
very
hollow
caves
under
the
rocks
in
which
the
water
was
tranquil
however
great
the
agitation
of
the
surface
he
undressed
leaving
his
clothing
on
the
deck
he
knew
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
clothing
when
aboard
the
cutter
he
retained
nothing
but
his
leather
belt
as
soon
as
he
was
stripped
he
placed
his
hand
upon
this
belt
buckled
it
more
securely
felt
for
the
iron
took
a
rapid
survey
in
the
direction
which
he
would
have
to
follow
among
the
breakers
and
the
waves
to
gain
the
man
rock
then
precipitating
himself
head
first
he
plunged
into
the
sea
as
he
dived
from
a
height
he
plunged
heavily
he
sank
deep
in
the
water
touched
the
bottom
skirted
for
a
moment
the
submarine
rocks
then
struck
out
to
regain
the
surface
at
that
moment
he
felt
himself
seized
by
one
foot
book
vii
the
danger
of
opening
a
book
at
random
i
the
pearl
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
a
few
moments
after
his
short
colloquy
with
sieur
landoys
gilliatt
was
at
sampson
he
was
troubled
even
anxious
what
could
it
be
that
had
happened
there
was
a
murmur
in
sampson
like
that
of
a
startled
hive
everybody
was
at
his
door
the
women
were
talking
loud
there
were
people
who
seemed
relating
some
occurrence
and
who
were
gesticulating
a
group
had
gathered
around
them
the
words
could
be
heard
what
a
misfortune
some
faces
wore
a
smile
gilliatt
interrogated
no
one
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
ask
questions
he
was
moreover
too
much
moved
to
speak
to
strangers
he
had
no
confidence
in
rumours
he
preferred
to
go
direct
to
the
bravées
his
anxiety
was
so
great
that
he
was
not
even
deterred
from
entering
the
house
the
door
of
the
great
lower
room
opening
upon
the
quay
moreover
stood
quite
open
there
was
a
swarm
of
men
and
women
on
the
threshold
everybody
was
going
in
and
gilliatt
went
with
the
rest
entering
he
found
sieur
landoys
standing
near
the
doorposts
you
have
heard
no
doubt
of
this
event
no
i
did
not
like
to
call
it
out
to
you
on
the
road
it
makes
me
like
a
bird
of
evil
omen
what
has
happened
the
durande
is
lost
there
was
a
crowd
in
the
great
room
the
various
groups
spoke
low
like
people
in
a
sick
chamber
the
assemblage
which
consisted
of
neighbours
the
first
comers
curious
to
learn
the
news
huddled
together
near
the
door
with
a
sort
of
timidity
leaving
clear
the
bottom
of
the
room
where
appeared
déruchette
sitting
and
in
tears
mess
lethierry
stood
beside
her
his
back
was
against
the
wall
at
the
end
of
the
room
his
sailor
cap
came
down
over
his
eyebrows
a
lock
of
grey
hair
hung
upon
his
cheek
he
said
nothing
his
arms
were
motionless
he
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
he
had
the
look
of
something
lifeless
placed
against
the
wall
it
was
easy
to
see
in
his
aspect
a
man
whose
life
had
been
crushed
within
him
the
durande
being
gone
lethierry
had
no
longer
any
object
in
his
existence
he
had
had
a
being
on
the
sea
that
being
had
suddenly
foundered
what
could
he
do
now
rise
every
morning
go
to
sleep
every
night
never
more
to
await
the
coming
of
the
durande
to
see
her
get
under
way
or
steer
again
into
the
port
what
was
a
remainder
of
existence
without
object
to
drink
to
eat
and
then
he
had
crowned
the
labours
of
his
life
by
a
masterpiece
won
by
his
devotion
a
new
step
in
civilisation
the
step
was
lost
the
masterpiece
destroyed
to
live
a
few
vacant
years
longer
where
would
be
the
good
henceforth
nothing
was
left
for
him
to
do
at
his
age
men
do
not
begin
life
anew
besides
he
was
ruined
poor
old
man
déruchette
sitting
near
him
on
a
chair
and
weeping
held
one
of
mess
lethierry
hands
in
hers
her
hands
were
joined
his
hand
was
clenched
fast
it
was
the
sign
of
the
shade
of
difference
in
their
two
sorrows
in
joined
hands
there
is
still
some
token
of
hope
in
the
clenched
fist
none
mess
lethierry
gave
up
his
arm
to
her
and
let
her
do
with
it
what
she
pleased
he
was
passive
struck
down
by
a
thunderbolt
he
had
scarcely
a
spark
of
life
left
within
him
there
is
a
degree
of
overwhelmment
which
abstracts
the
mind
entirely
from
its
fellowship
with
man
the
forms
which
come
and
go
within
your
room
become
confused
and
indistinct
they
pass
by
even
touch
you
but
never
really
come
near
you
you
are
far
away
inaccessible
to
them
as
they
to
you
the
intensities
of
joy
and
despair
differ
in
this
in
despair
we
take
cognisance
of
the
world
only
as
something
dim
and
afar
off
we
are
insensible
to
the
things
before
our
eyes
we
lose
the
feeling
of
our
own
existence
it
is
in
vain
at
such
times
that
we
are
flesh
and
blood
our
consciousness
of
life
is
none
the
more
real
we
are
become
even
to
ourselves
nothing
but
a
dream
mess
lethierry
gaze
indicated
that
he
had
reached
this
state
of
absorption
the
various
groups
were
whispering
together
they
exchanged
information
as
far
as
they
had
gathered
it
this
was
the
substance
of
their
news
the
durande
had
been
wrecked
the
day
before
in
the
fog
on
the
douvres
about
an
hour
before
sunset
with
the
exception
of
the
captain
who
refused
to
leave
his
vessel
the
crew
and
passengers
had
all
escaped
in
the
a
squall
from
the
springing
up
as
the
fog
had
cleared
had
almost
wrecked
them
a
second
time
and
had
carried
them
out
to
sea
beyond
guernsey
in
the
night
they
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
the
which
had
taken
them
aboard
and
landed
them
at
peter
port
the
disaster
was
entirely
the
fault
of
the
steersman
tangrouille
who
was
in
prison
clubin
had
behaved
nobly
the
pilots
who
had
mustered
in
great
force
pronounced
the
words
the
douvres
with
a
peculiar
emphasis
a
dreary
house
that
said
one
a
compass
and
a
bundle
of
registers
and
lay
on
the
table
they
were
doubtless
the
compass
of
the
durande
and
the
papers
handed
by
clubin
to
imbrancam
and
tangrouille
at
the
moment
of
the
departure
of
the
they
were
the
evidences
of
the
magnificent
of
that
man
who
had
busied
himself
with
saving
these
documents
even
in
the
presence
of
death
itself
a
little
incident
full
of
moral
grandeur
an
instance
of
sublime
never
to
be
forgotten
they
were
unanimous
in
their
admiration
of
clubin
unanimous
also
in
believing
him
to
be
saved
after
all
the
cutter
had
arrived
some
hours
after
the
it
was
this
vessel
which
had
brought
the
last
items
of
intelligence
she
had
passed
hours
in
the
same
waters
as
the
durande
she
had
in
the
fog
and
tacked
about
during
the
squall
the
captain
of
the
was
present
among
the
company
this
captain
had
just
finished
his
narrative
to
lethierry
as
gilliatt
entered
the
narrative
was
a
true
one
towards
the
morning
the
storm
having
abated
and
the
wind
becoming
manageable
the
captain
of
the
had
heard
the
lowing
of
oxen
in
the
open
sea
this
rural
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
had
naturally
startled
him
he
steered
in
that
direction
and
perceived
the
durande
among
the
douvres
the
sea
had
sufficiently
subsided
for
him
to
approach
he
hailed
the
wreck
the
bellowing
of
the
cattle
was
the
sole
reply
the
captain
of
the
was
confident
that
there
was
no
one
aboard
the
durande
the
wreck
still
held
together
well
and
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
squall
clubin
could
have
passed
the
night
there
he
was
not
the
man
to
leave
go
his
hold
very
easily
he
was
not
there
however
and
therefore
he
must
have
been
rescued
it
was
certain
that
several
sloops
and
luggers
from
granville
and
malo
must
after
in
the
fog
on
the
previous
evening
have
passed
pretty
near
the
rocks
it
was
evident
that
one
of
these
had
taken
clubin
aboard
it
was
to
be
remembered
that
the
of
the
durande
was
full
when
it
left
the
unlucky
vessel
that
it
was
certain
to
encounter
great
risks
that
another
man
aboard
would
have
overloaded
her
and
perhaps
caused
her
to
founder
and
that
these
circumstances
had
no
doubt
weighed
with
clubin
in
coming
to
his
determination
to
remain
on
the
wreck
his
duty
however
once
fulfilled
and
a
vessel
at
hand
clubin
assuredly
would
not
have
scrupled
to
avail
himself
of
its
aid
a
hero
is
not
necessarily
an
idiot
the
idea
of
a
suicide
was
absurd
in
connection
with
a
man
of
clubin
irreproachable
character
the
culprit
too
was
tangrouille
not
clubin
all
this
was
conclusive
the
captain
of
the
was
evidently
right
and
everybody
expected
to
see
clubin
reappear
very
shortly
there
was
a
project
abroad
to
carry
him
through
the
town
in
triumph
two
things
appeared
certain
from
the
narrative
of
the
captain
clubin
was
saved
the
durande
lost
as
regarded
the
durande
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
the
fact
the
catastrophe
was
irremediable
the
captain
of
the
had
witnessed
the
last
moments
of
the
wreck
the
sharp
rock
on
which
the
vessel
had
been
as
it
were
nailed
had
held
her
fast
during
the
night
and
resisted
the
shock
of
the
tempest
as
if
reluctant
to
part
with
its
prey
but
in
the
morning
at
the
moment
when
the
captain
of
the
had
convinced
himself
that
there
was
no
one
aboard
to
be
saved
and
was
about
to
wear
off
again
one
of
those
seas
which
are
like
the
last
angry
blows
of
a
tempest
had
struck
her
the
wave
lifted
her
violently
from
her
place
and
with
the
swiftness
and
directness
of
an
arrow
from
a
bow
had
thrown
her
against
the
two
douvres
rocks
an
infernal
crash
was
heard
said
the
captain
the
vessel
lifted
by
the
wave
to
a
certain
height
had
plunged
between
the
two
rocks
up
to
her
midship
frame
she
had
stuck
fast
again
but
more
firmly
than
on
the
submarine
rocks
she
must
have
remained
there
suspended
and
exposed
to
every
wind
and
sea
the
durande
according
to
the
statements
of
the
crew
of
the
was
already
three
parts
broken
up
she
would
evidently
have
foundered
during
the
night
if
the
rocks
had
not
kept
her
up
the
captain
of
the
had
watched
her
a
long
time
with
his
spyglass
he
gave
with
naval
precision
the
details
of
her
disaster
the
starboard
quarter
beaten
in
the
masts
maimed
the
sails
blown
from
the
the
shrouds
torn
away
the
cabin
smashed
by
the
falling
of
one
of
the
booms
the
dome
of
the
beaten
in
the
chocks
of
the
struck
away
the
overturned
the
hinges
of
the
rudder
broken
the
trusses
wrenched
away
the
demolished
the
bits
gone
the
destroyed
the
knocked
off
the
broken
as
to
the
parts
of
the
cargo
made
fast
before
the
foremast
all
destroyed
made
a
clean
sweep
of
gone
to
ten
thousand
shivers
with
top
ropes
iron
pulleys
and
chains
the
durande
had
broken
her
back
the
sea
now
must
break
her
up
piecemeal
in
a
few
days
there
would
be
nothing
of
her
remaining
it
appeared
that
the
engine
was
scarcely
injured
by
all
these
ravages
a
remarkable
fact
and
one
which
proved
its
excellence
the
captain
of
the
thought
he
could
affirm
that
the
crank
had
received
no
serious
injury
the
vessel
masts
had
given
way
but
the
funnel
had
resisted
everything
only
the
iron
guards
of
the
captain
gangway
were
twisted
the
paddle
boxes
had
suffered
the
frames
were
bruised
but
the
paddles
had
not
a
float
missing
the
machinery
was
intact
such
was
the
conviction
of
the
captain
of
the
imbrancam
the
engineer
who
was
among
the
crowd
had
the
same
conviction
the
negro
more
intelligent
than
many
of
his
white
companions
was
proud
of
his
engines
he
lifted
up
his
arms
opening
the
ten
fingers
of
his
black
hands
and
said
to
lethierry
as
he
sat
there
silent
master
the
machinery
is
alive
still
the
safety
of
clubin
seeming
certain
and
the
hull
of
the
durande
being
already
sacrificed
the
engines
became
the
topic
of
conversation
among
the
crowd
they
took
an
interest
in
it
as
in
a
living
thing
they
felt
a
delight
in
praising
its
good
qualities
that
what
i
call
a
machine
said
a
french
sailor
something
like
a
good
one
cried
a
guernsey
fisherman
she
must
have
some
good
stuff
in
her
said
the
captain
of
the
to
come
out
of
that
affair
with
only
a
few
scratches
by
degrees
the
machinery
of
the
durande
became
the
absorbing
object
of
their
thoughts
opinions
were
warm
for
and
against
it
had
its
enemies
and
its
friends
more
than
one
who
possessed
a
good
old
sailing
cutter
and
who
hoped
to
get
a
share
of
the
business
of
the
durande
was
not
sorry
to
find
that
the
douvres
rock
had
disposed
of
the
new
invention
the
whispering
became
louder
the
discussion
grew
noisy
though
the
hubbub
was
evidently
a
little
restrained
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
simultaneous
lowering
of
voices
out
of
respect
to
lethierry
silence
the
result
of
the
colloquy
so
obstinately
maintained
on
all
sides
was
as
follows
the
engines
were
the
vital
part
of
the
vessel
to
rescue
the
durande
was
impossible
but
the
machinery
might
still
be
saved
these
engines
were
unique
to
construct
others
similar
the
money
was
wanting
but
to
find
the
artificer
would
have
been
still
more
difficult
it
was
remembered
that
the
constructor
of
the
machinery
was
dead
it
had
cost
forty
thousand
francs
no
one
would
risk
again
such
a
sum
upon
such
a
chance
particularly
as
it
was
now
discovered
that
steamboats
could
be
lost
like
other
vessels
the
accident
of
the
durande
destroyed
the
prestige
of
all
her
previous
success
still
it
was
deplorable
to
think
that
at
that
very
moment
this
valuable
mechanism
was
still
entire
and
in
good
condition
and
that
in
five
or
six
days
it
would
probably
go
to
pieces
like
the
vessel
herself
as
long
as
this
existed
it
might
almost
be
said
that
there
was
no
shipwreck
the
loss
of
the
engines
was
alone
irreparable
to
save
the
machinery
would
be
almost
to
repair
the
disaster
save
the
machinery
it
was
easy
to
talk
of
it
but
who
would
undertake
to
do
it
was
it
possible
even
to
scheme
and
to
execute
are
two
different
things
as
different
as
to
dream
and
to
do
now
if
ever
a
dream
had
appeared
wild
and
impracticable
it
was
that
of
saving
the
engines
then
embedded
between
the
douvres
the
idea
of
sending
a
ship
and
a
crew
to
work
upon
those
rocks
was
absurd
it
could
not
be
thought
of
it
was
the
season
of
heavy
seas
in
the
first
gale
the
chains
of
the
anchors
would
be
worn
away
and
snapped
upon
the
submarine
peaks
and
the
vessel
must
be
shattered
on
the
rocks
that
would
be
to
send
a
second
shipwreck
to
the
relief
of
the
first
on
the
miserable
narrow
height
where
the
legend
of
the
place
described
the
shipwrecked
sailor
as
having
perished
of
hunger
there
was
scarcely
room
for
one
person
to
save
the
engines
therefore
it
would
be
necessary
for
a
man
to
go
to
the
douvres
to
be
alone
in
that
sea
alone
in
that
desert
alone
at
five
leagues
from
the
coast
alone
in
that
region
of
terrors
alone
for
entire
weeks
alone
in
the
presence
of
dangers
foreseen
and
unforeseen
without
supplies
in
the
face
of
hunger
and
nakedness
without
succour
in
the
time
of
distress
without
token
of
human
life
around
him
save
the
bleached
bones
of
the
miserable
being
who
had
perished
there
in
his
misery
without
companionship
save
that
of
death
and
besides
how
was
it
possible
to
extricate
the
machinery
it
would
require
not
only
a
sailor
but
an
engineer
and
for
what
trials
must
he
not
prepare
the
man
who
would
attempt
such
a
task
must
be
more
than
a
hero
he
must
be
a
madman
for
in
certain
enterprises
in
which
superhuman
power
appears
necessary
there
is
a
sort
of
madness
which
is
more
potent
than
courage
and
after
all
would
it
not
be
a
folly
to
immolate
oneself
for
a
mass
of
rusted
iron
no
it
was
certain
that
nobody
would
undertake
to
go
to
the
douvres
on
such
an
errand
the
engine
must
be
abandoned
like
the
rest
the
engineer
for
such
a
task
would
assuredly
not
be
forthcoming
where
indeed
should
they
look
for
such
a
man
all
this
or
similar
observations
formed
the
substance
of
the
confused
conversations
of
the
crowd
the
captain
of
the
who
had
been
a
pilot
summed
up
the
views
of
all
by
exclaiming
aloud
no
it
is
all
over
the
man
does
not
exist
who
could
go
there
and
rescue
the
machinery
of
the
durande
if
i
do
go
said
imbrancam
it
is
because
nobody
could
do
it
the
captain
of
the
shook
his
left
hand
in
the
air
with
that
sudden
movement
which
expresses
a
conviction
that
a
thing
is
impossible
if
he
existed
continued
the
captain
déruchette
turned
her
head
impulsively
and
interrupted
i
would
marry
him
she
said
innocently
there
was
a
pause
a
man
made
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
standing
before
her
pale
and
anxious
said
you
would
marry
him
miss
déruchette
it
was
gilliatt
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
mess
lethierry
had
just
before
stood
upright
and
gazed
about
him
his
eyes
glittered
with
a
strange
light
he
took
off
his
sailor
cap
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
then
looked
solemnly
before
him
and
without
seeing
any
of
the
persons
present
said
déruchette
should
be
his
i
pledge
myself
to
it
in
god
name
ii
much
astonishment
on
the
western
coast
the
full
moon
rose
at
ten
on
the
following
night
but
however
fine
the
night
however
favourable
the
wind
and
sea
no
fisherman
thought
of
going
out
that
evening
either
from
hogue
la
perre
or
bourdeaux
harbour
or
houmet
benet
or
platon
or
port
grat
or
vazon
bay
or
perrelle
bay
or
pezeries
or
the
tielles
or
saints
bay
or
little
bo
or
any
other
port
or
little
harbour
in
guernsey
and
the
reason
was
very
simple
a
cock
had
been
heard
to
crow
at
noonday
when
the
cock
is
heard
to
crow
at
an
extraordinary
hour
fishing
is
suspended
at
dusk
on
that
evening
however
a
fisherman
returning
to
omptolle
met
with
a
remarkable
adventure
on
the
height
above
houmet
paradis
beyond
the
two
brayes
and
the
two
grunes
stands
to
the
left
the
beacon
of
the
plattes
tougères
representing
a
tub
reversed
and
to
the
right
the
beacon
of
sampson
representing
the
face
of
a
man
between
these
two
the
fisherman
thought
that
he
perceived
for
the
first
time
a
third
beacon
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
beacon
when
had
it
been
erected
on
that
point
what
shoal
did
it
indicate
the
beacon
responded
immediately
to
these
interrogations
it
moved
it
was
a
mast
the
astonishment
of
the
fisherman
did
not
diminish
a
beacon
would
have
been
remarkable
a
mast
was
still
more
so
it
could
not
be
a
when
everybody
else
was
returning
some
boat
was
going
out
who
could
it
be
and
what
was
he
about
ten
minutes
later
the
vessel
moving
slowly
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
omptolle
fisherman
he
did
not
recognise
it
he
heard
the
sound
of
rowing
there
were
evidently
only
two
oars
there
was
probably
then
only
one
man
aboard
the
wind
was
northerly
the
man
therefore
was
evidently
paddling
along
in
order
to
take
the
wind
off
point
fontenelle
there
he
would
probably
take
to
his
sails
he
intended
then
to
double
the
ancresse
and
mount
crevel
what
could
that
mean
the
vessel
passed
the
fisherman
returned
home
on
that
same
night
at
different
hours
and
at
different
points
various
persons
scattered
and
isolated
on
the
western
coast
of
guernsey
observed
certain
facts
as
the
omptolle
fisherman
was
mooring
his
bark
a
carter
of
seaweed
about
off
whipping
his
horses
along
the
lonely
road
from
the
clôtures
near
the
druid
stones
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
martello
towers
and
saw
far
off
at
sea
in
a
part
little
frequented
because
it
requires
much
knowledge
of
the
waters
and
in
the
direction
of
north
rock
and
the
jablonneuse
a
sail
being
hoisted
he
paid
little
attention
to
the
circumstance
not
being
a
seaman
but
a
carter
of
seaweed
had
perhaps
elapsed
since
the
carter
had
perceived
this
vessel
when
a
plasterer
returning
from
his
work
in
the
town
and
passing
round
pelée
pool
found
himself
suddenly
opposite
a
vessel
sailing
boldly
among
the
rocks
of
the
quenon
the
rousse
de
mer
and
the
gripe
de
rousse
the
night
was
dark
but
the
sky
was
light
over
the
sea
an
effect
common
enough
and
he
could
distinguish
a
great
distance
in
every
direction
there
was
no
sail
visible
except
this
vessel
a
little
lower

of
crayfish

his

was
puzzled
to
make
out
the
movements
of
a
vessel
between
the
boue

and
the
moubrette
the
man
must
have
been
a
good
pilot
and
in
great
haste
to
reach
some
destination
to
risk
his
boat
there
just
as
eight
was
striking
at
the
catel
the
at

observed
with
astonishment
a
sail
out
beyond
the
boue

and
the
grunettes
and
very
near
the
susanne
and
the
western
grunes
not

from

upon
the
solitary
point
of
the

two
lovers
were
lingering
hesitating
before
they
parted
for

interrupted
by

messellettes
monsieur
le
peyre
des
norgiots
an
inhabitant
of
cotillon
pipet
was
engaged
about
nine
in
the
evening
in
examining
a
hole
made
by
some
trespassers
in
the
hedge
of
his
property
called
la
jennerotte
and
his
planted
with
trees
even
while
ascertaining
the
amount
of
the
damage
he
could
not
help
observing
a
audaciously
making
its
way
round
the
crocq
point
at
that
hour
of
night
on
the
morrow
of
a
tempest
when
there
is
always
some
agitation
upon
the
sea
that
route
was
extremely
unsafe
it
was
rash
to
choose
it
at
least
unless
the
steersman
knew
all
the
channels
by
heart
at
nine
at
a
trawler
carrying
home

for
a
time
to
observe
between
colombelle
and
the
soufleresse
something
which
looked
like
a
boat
the
boat
was
in
a
dangerous
position
sudden
gusts
of
wind
of
a
very
dangerous
kind
are
very
common
in
that
spot
the
or
blower
derives
its
name
from
the
sudden
gusts
of
wind
which
it
seems
to
direct
upon
the
vessels
which
by
rare
chance
find
their
way
thither
at
the
moment
when
the
moon
was
rising
the
tide
being
high
and
the
sea
being
quiet
in
the
little
strait
of
the
solitary
keeper
of
the
island
of
was
considerably
startled
a
long
black
object
slowly
passed
between
the
moon
and
him
this
dark
form
high
and
narrow
resembled
a
spread
out
and
moving
it
glided
along
the
line
of
the
top
of
the
wall
formed
by
the
ridges
of
rock
the
keeper
of
fancied
that
he
had
beheld
the
black
lady
the
white
lady
inhabits
the
tau
de
pez
the
grey
lady
the
tau
de
pez
the
red
lady
the
silleuse
to
the
north
of
the
marquis
bank
and
the
black
lady
the
grand
etacré
to
the
west
of
at
night
when
the
moon
shines
these
ladies
stalk
abroad
and
sometimes
meet
that
dark
form
might
undoubtedly
be
a
sail
the
long
groups
of
rocks
on
which
she
appeared
to
be
walking
might
in
fact
be
concealing
the
hull
of
a
bark
navigating
behind
them
and
allowing
only
her
sail
to
be
seen
but
the
keeper
asked
himself
what
bark
would
dare
at
that
hour
to
venture
herself
between
and
the
pécheresses
and
the
anguillières
and
lérée
point
and
what
object
could
she
have
it
seemed
to
him
much
more
probable
that
it
was
the
black
lady
as
the
moon
was
passing
the
of
peter
in
the
wood
the
serjeant
at
castle
rocquaine
while
in
the
act
of
raising
the
drawbridge
of
the
castle
distinguished
at
the
end
of
the
bay
beyond
the
haute
canée
but
nearer
than
the
sambule
a
which
seemed
to
be
steadily
dropping
down
from
north
to
south
on
the
southern
coast
of
guernsey
behind
pleinmont
in
the
curve
of
a
bay
composed
entirely
of
precipices
and
rocky
walls
rising
from
the
sea
there
is
a
singular
to
which
a
french
gentleman
a
resident
of
the
island
since
has
given
the
name
of
the
port
on
the
fourth
floor
a
name
now
generally
adopted
this
port
or
which
was
then
called
the
moie
is
a
rocky
plateau
by
nature
half
by
art
raised
about
forty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
waves
and
communicating
with
the
water
by
two
large
beams
laid
parallel
in
the
form
of
an
inclined
plane
the
are
hoisted
up
there
by
chains
and
pulleys
from
the
sea
and
are
let
down
again
in
the
same
way
along
these
beams
which
are
like
two
rails
for
the
fishermen
there
is
a
ladder
the
port
was
at
the
time
of
our
story
much
frequented
by
the
smugglers
being
difficult
of
access
it
was
well
suited
to
their
purposes
towards
eleven
some
smugglers
perhaps
the
same
upon
whose
aid
clubin
had
counted
stood
with
their
bales
of
goods
on
the
summit
of
this
platform
of
the
moie
a
smuggler
is
necessarily
a
man
on
the
look
out
it
is
part
of
his
business
to
watch
they
were
astonished
to
perceive
a
sail
suddenly
make
its
appearance
beyond
the
dusky
outline
of
cape
pleinmont
it
was
moonlight
the
smugglers
observed
the
sail
narrowly
suspecting
that
it
might
be
some
cutter
about
to
lie
in
ambush
behind
the
great
hanway
but
the
sail
left
the
hanways
behind
passed
to
the
of
the
boue
blondel
and
was
lost
in
the
pale
mists
of
the
horizon
out
at
sea
where
the
devil
can
that
boat
be
sailing
asked
the
smuggler
that
same
evening
a
little
after
sunset
some
one
had
been
heard
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
old
house
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
it
was
a
boy
wearing
brown
clothes
and
yellow
stockings
a
fact
that
indicated
that
he
was
a
little
parish
clerk
an
old
fisherwoman
prowling
about
the
shore
with
a
lantern
in
her
hand
had
called
to
the
boy
and
this
dialogue
ensued
between
the
fisherwoman
and
the
little
clerk
before
the
entrance
to
the
bû
de
la
rue
what

the
man
of
this
place

of

to

him
a
visit

do

me
to
ask
if

man
who
lives

iii
a
quotation
from
the
bible
during
the
hours
which
followed
mess
lethierry
slept
not
ate
nothing
drank
nothing
he
kissed
déruchette
on
the
forehead
asked
after
clubin
of
whom
there
was
as
yet
no
news
signed
a
declaration
certifying
that
he
had
no
intention
of
preferring
a
charge
against
anyone
and
set
tangrouille
at
liberty
all
the
morning
of
the
next
day
he
remained
half
supporting
himself
on
the
table
of
the
office
of
the
durande
neither
standing
nor
sitting
answering
kindly
when
anyone
spoke
to
him
curiosity
being
satisfied
the
bravées
had
become
a
solitude
there
is
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
generally
mingled
with
the
haste
of
condolences
the
door
had
closed
again
and
left
the
old
man
again
alone
with
déruchette
the
strange
light
that
had
shone
in
lethierry
eyes
was
extinguished
the
mournful
look
which
filled
them
after
the
first
news
of
the
disaster
had
returned
déruchette
anxious
for
his
sake
had
on
the
advice
of
grace
and
douce
laid
silently
beside
him
a
pair
of
stockings
which
he
had
been
knitting
sailor
fashion
when
the
bad
news
had
arrived
he
smiled
bitterly
and
said
they
must
think
me
foolish
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
silence
he
added
these
things
are
well
when
you
are
happy
déruchette
carried
away
the
stockings
and
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
remove
also
the
compass
and
the
ship
papers
which
lethierry
had
been
brooding
over
too
long
in
the
afternoon
a
little
before
the
door
opened
and
two
strangers
entered
attired
in
black
one
was
old
the
other
young
the
young
one
has
perhaps
already
been
observed
in
the
course
of
this
story
the
two
men
had
each
a
grave
air
but
their
gravity
appeared
different
the
old
man
possessed
what
might
be
called
state
gravity
the
gravity
of
the
young
man
was
in
his
nature
habit
engenders
the
one
thought
the
other
they
were
as
their
costume
indicated
two
clergymen
each
belonging
to
the
established
church
the
first
fact
in
the
appearance
of
the
younger
man
which
might
have
first
struck
the
observer
was
that
his
gravity
though
conspicuous
in
the
expression
of
his
features
and
evidently
springing
from
the
mind
was
not
indicated
by
his
person
gravity
is
not
inconsistent
with
passion
which
it
exalts
by
purifying
it
but
the
idea
of
gravity
could
with
difficulty
be
associated
with
an
exterior
remarkable
above
all
for
personal
beauty
being
in
holy
orders
he
must
have
been
at
least
but
he
seemed
scarcely
more
than
eighteen
he
possessed
those
gifts
at
once
in
harmony
with
and
in
opposition
to
each
other
a
soul
which
seemed
created
for
exalted
passion
and
a
body
created
for
love
he
was
fair
slim
and
elegant
in
his
severe
attire
and
he
had
the
cheeks
of
a
young
girl
and
delicate
hands
his
movements
were
natural
and
lively
though
subdued
everything
about
him
was
pleasing
elegant
almost
voluptuous
the
beauty
of
his
expression
served
to
correct
this
excess
of
personal
attraction
his
open
smile
which
showed
his
teeth
regular
and
white
as
those
of
a
child
had
something
in
it
pensive
even
devotional
he
had
the
gracefulness
of
a
page
mingled
with
the
dignity
of
a
bishop
his
fair
hair
so
fair
and
golden
as
to
be
almost
effeminate
clustered
over
his
white
forehead
which
was
high
and
a
slight
double
line
between
the
eyebrows
awakened
associations
with
studious
thought
those
who
saw
him
felt
themselves
in
the
presence
of
one
of
those
natures
benevolent
innocent
and
pure
whose
progress
is
in
inverse
sense
with
that
of
vulgar
minds
natures
whom
illusion
renders
wise
and
whom
experience
makes
enthusiasts
his
older
companion
was
no
other
than
doctor
jaquemin
hérode
doctor
jaquemin
hérode
belonged
to
the
high
church
a
party
whose
system
is
a
sort
of
popery
without
a
pope
the
church
of
england
was
at
that
epoch
labouring
with
the
tendencies
which
have
since
become
strengthened
and
condensed
in
the
form
of
puseyism
doctor
jaquemin
hérode
belonged
to
that
shade
of
anglicanism
which
is
almost
a
variety
of
the
church
of
rome
he
was
haughty
precise
stiff
and
commanding
his
inner
sight
scarcely
penetrated
outwardly
he
possessed
the
letter
in
the
place
of
the
spirit
his
manner
was
arrogant
his
presence
imposing
he
had
less
the
appearance
of
a
reverend
than
of
a
his
was
cut
somewhat
in
the
fashion
of
a
cassock
his
true
centre
would
have
been
rome
he
was
a
born
prelate
of
the
antechamber
he
seemed
to
have
been
created
expressly
to
fill
a
part
in
the
papal
court
to
walk
behind
the
pontifical
litter
with
all
the
court
of
rome
in
the
accident
of
his
english
birth
and
his
theological
education
directed
more
towards
the
old
than
the
new
testament
had
deprived
him
of
that
destiny
all
his
splendours
were
comprised
in
his
preferments
as
rector
of
peter
port
dean
of
the
island
of
guernsey
and
surrogate
of
the
bishop
of
winchester
these
were
undoubtedly
not
without
their
glories
these
glories
did
not
prevent
jaquemin
hérode
being
on
the
whole
a
worthy
man
as
a
theologian
he
was
esteemed
by
those
who
were
able
to
judge
of
such
matters
he
was
almost
an
authority
in
the
court
of
arches
that
sorbonne
of
england
he
had
the
true
air
of
erudition
a
learned
contraction
of
the
eyes
bristling
nostrils
teeth
which
showed
themselves
at
all
times
a
thin
upper
lip
and
a
thick
lower
one
he
was
the
possessor
of
several
learned
degrees
a
valuable
prebend
titled
friends
the
confidence
of
the
bishop
and
a
bible
which
he
carried
always
in
his
pocket
mess
lethierry
was
so
completely
absorbed
that
the
entrance
of
the
two
priests
produced
no
effect
upon
him
save
a
slight
movement
of
the
eyebrows
jaquemin
hérode
advanced
bowed
alluded
in
a
few
sober
and
dignified
words
to
his
recent
promotion
and
mentioned
that
he
came
according
to
custom
to
introduce
among
the
inhabitants
and
to

the
two
visitors
seated
themselves
near
the
table

commenced
a
discourse
it
had
reached
his
ears
that
a
serious
misfortune
had
befallen
his
host
the
durande
had
been
lost
he
came
as
lethierry
pastor
to
offer
condolence
and
advice
this
shipwreck
was
unfortunate
and
yet
not
without
compensations
let
us
examine
our
own
hearts
are

not
puffed
up
with
prosperity
the
waters
of
felicity
are
dangerous
troubles
must
be
submitted
to
cheerfully
the
ways
of

mysterious

lethierry
was
ruined
perhaps
but
riches
were
a
danger

may
have
false
friends

will
disperse
them
and
leave
you
alone
the
durande
was
reported
to
have
brought
a
revenue
of
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
per
annum
it
was
more
than
enough

not
rebel
against

in

who
can
say
that
the
loss
of
the
durande
may
not
have
its
advantages
even
of
a
temporal
kind
he
for
instance
doctor
jaquemin
hérode
had
invested
some
money
in
an
excellent
enterprise
now
in
progress
at
sheffield
if
mess
lethierry
with
the
wealth
which
might
still
remain
to
him
should
choose
to
embark
in
the
same
affair
he
might
transfer
his
capital
to
that
town
it
was
an
extensive
manufactory
of
arms
for
the
supply
of
the
czar
now
engaged
in
repressing

in

there
was
a
good
prospect
of
obtaining
three
hundred
per

profit
the
word

appeared
to
awaken
lethierry
he
interrupted
hérode
i
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
czar
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
replied
mess

are
recognised
by

it
is
written
unto

the
things
which
are
cæsar
the
czar
is

lethierry
partly
relapsed
into
his
dream
and
muttered
cæsar
who
is
cæsar
i
do
know
the
rev
jaquemin
hérode
continued
his
exhortations
he
did
not
press
the
question
of
sheffield
to
contemn
a
cæsar
was
republicanism
he
could
understand
a
man
being
a
republican
in
that
case
he
could
turn
his
thoughts
towards
a
republic
mess
lethierry
might
repair
his
fortune
in
the
united
states
even
better
than
in
england
if
he
desired
to
invest
what
remained
to
him
at
great
profit
he
had
only
to
take
shares
in
the
great
company
for
developing
the
resources
of

which
employed
more
than
twenty
thousand

said
lethierry

replied
the

hérode
is
an
institution

shall
not
be

and
douce
at
the
door
of
the
room
listened
in
a
sort
of
ecstacy
to
the
words
of
the
reverend
doctor
the
doctor
continued
he
was
all
things
considered
as
we
have
said
a
worthy
man
and
whatever
his
differences
personal
or
connected
with
caste
with
mess
lethierry
he
had
come
very
sincerely
to
offer
him
that
spiritual
and
even
temporal
aid
which
he
doctor
jaquemin
hérode
dispensed
if
mess
lethierry
fortune
had
been
diminished
to
that
point
that
he
was
unable
to
take
a
beneficial
part
in
any
speculation
russian
or
american
why
should
he
not
obtain
some
government
appointment
suited
to
him
there
were
many
very
respectable
places
open
to
him
and
the
reverend
gentleman
was
ready
to
recommend
him
the
office
of
was
just
vacant
mess
lethierry
was
popular
and
respected
and
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
dean
of

of

would
make
an
effort
to
obtain
for

fixed
his
eye
upon

i
do
like

he
said
doctor
hérode
who
up
to
this
point
had
pronounced
his
words
with
the
same
intonation
had
now
a
fit
of
severity

tone
became
slightly
changed

the
reverend
ebenezer
imperceptibly
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
reverend
doctor
and
said
so
as
to
be
heard
only
by
him
what
this
man
says
is
dictated
to
him
by

by
what
demanded
the
reverend
jaquemin

in
the
same
tone
the
young
man
replied
in
a
whisper
by
his
conscience
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
felt
in
his
pocket
drew
out
a
thick
little
bound
volume
with
clasps
and
said
aloud

book

let

not

without
reading
a
page
of
the
holy
book
it
is
from
books
that
wise
men
derive
consolation
in
the
troubles
of
life
the

have
their
oracles
but
believers
have
their
ready
resource
in
the

the
first
book
which
comes
to

opened
by

afford
counsel
but
the
bible
opened
at
any
page
yields
a
revelation
it
is
above
all
a
boon
to
the
afflicted
yes
holy
scripture
is
an
unfailing
balm
for
their
wounds
in
the
presence
of
affliction
it
is
good
to
consult
its
sacred
pages
to
open
even
without
choosing
the
place
and
to
read
with
faith
the
passage
which
we
find
what
man
does
not
choose
is
chosen
by
god
he
knoweth
best
what
suiteth
us
his

pointeth
invisibly
to
that
which
we
read
whatever
be
the
page
it
will
infallibly
enlighten
let
us
seek
then
no
other
light
but
hold
fast
to
his
it
is
the
word
from
on
high
in
the
text
which
is
evoked
with
confidence
and
reverence
often
do
we
find
a
mysterious
significance
in
our
present
troubles
let
us
hearken
then
and
obey

you
are

the

you

the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
touched
the
spring
of
the
clasp
and
let
his
finger
slip
between
the
leaves
then
he
placed
his
hand
a
moment
upon
the
open
volume
collected
his
thoughts
and
raising
his
eyes
impressively
began
to
read
in
a
loud
voice
the
passage
which
he
had
lighted
on
was
as
follows
and
isaac
went
out
to
meditate
in
the
field
at
the
eventide
and
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
and
beheld
the
camels
were
coming
and
rebekah
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
when
she
saw
isaac
she
lighted
off
the
camel
for
she
had
said
unto
the
servant
what
man
is
this
that
walketh
in

to
meet

and
isaac
brought
her
into
his

became

i
the
place
which
is
difficult
to
reach
and
difficult
to
leave
the
bark
which
had
been
observed
at
so
many
points
on
the
coast
of
guernsey
on
the
previous
evening
was
as
the
reader
has
guessed
the
old
dutch
barge
or
sloop
gilliatt
had
chosen
the
channel
along
the
coast
among
the
rocks
it
was
the
most
dangerous
way
but
it
was
the
most
direct
to
take
the
shortest
route
was
his
only
thought
shipwrecks
will
not
wait
the
sea
is
a
pressing
creditor
an
hour
delay
may
be
irreparable
his
anxiety
was
to
go
quickly
to
the
rescue
of
the
machinery
in
danger
one
of
his
objects
in
leaving
guernsey
was
to
avoid
arousing
attention
he
set
out
like
one
escaping
from
justice
and
seemed
anxious
to
hide
from
human
eyes
he
shunned
the
eastern
coast
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
pass
in
sight
of
sampson
and
peter
port
and
glided
silently
along
the
opposite
coast
which
is
comparatively
uninhabited
among
the
breakers
it
was
necessary
to
ply
the
oars
but
gilliatt
managed
them
on
scientific
principles
taking
the
water
quietly
and
dropping
it
with
exact
regularity
he
was
able
to
move
in
the
darkness
with
as
little
noise
and
as
rapidly
as
possible
so
stealthy
were
his
movements
that
he
might
have
seemed
to
be
bent
upon
some
evil
errand
in
truth
though
embarking
desperately
in
an
enterprise
which
might
well
be
called
impossible
and
risking
his
life
with
nearly
every
chance
against
him
he
feared
nothing
but
the
possibility
of
some
rival
in
the
work
which
he
had
set
before
him
as
the
day
began
to
break
those
unknown
eyes
which
look
down
upon
the
world
from
boundless
space
might
have
beheld
at
one
of
the
most
dangerous
and
solitary
spots
at
sea
two
objects
the
distance
between
which
was
gradually
decreasing
as
the
one
was
approaching
the
other
one
which
was
almost
imperceptible
in
the
wide
movement
of
the
waters
was
a
sailing
boat
in
this
was
a
man
it
was
the
sloop
the
other
black
motionless
colossal
rose
above
the
waves
a
singular
form
two
tall
pillars
issuing
from
the
sea
bore
aloft
a
sort
of
which
was
like
a
bridge
between
them
this
bridge
so
singular
in
shape
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
what
it
was
from
a
distance
touched
each
of
the
two
pillars
it
resembled
a
vast
portal
of
what
use
could
such
an
erection
be
in
that
open
plain
the
sea
which
stretched
around
it
far
and
wide
it
might
have
been
imagined
to
be
a
titanic
cromlech
planted
there
in
by
an
imperious
whim
and
built
up
by
hands
accustomed
to
proportion
their
labours
to
the
great
deep
its
wild
outline
stood
against
the
clear
sky
the
morning
light
was
growing
stronger
in
the
east
the
whiteness
in
the
horizon
deepened
the
shadow
on
the
sea
in
the
opposite
sky
the
moon
was
sinking
the
two
perpendicular
forms
were
the
douvres
the
huge
mass
held
fast
between
them
like
an
architrave
between
two
pillars
was
the
wreck
of
the
durande
the
rock
thus
holding
fast
and
exhibiting
its
prey
was
terrible
to
behold
inanimate
things
look
sometimes
as
if
endowed
with
a
dark
and
hostile
spirit
towards
man
there
was
a
menace
in
the
attitude
of
the
rocks
they
seemed
to
be
biding
their
time
nothing
could
be
more
suggestive
of
haughtiness
and
arrogance
than
their
whole
appearance
the
conquered
vessel
the
triumphant
abyss
the
two
rocks
still
streaming
with
the
tempest
of
the
day
before
were
like
two
wrestlers
sweating
from
a
recent
struggle
the
wind
had
sunk
the
sea
rippled
gently
here
and
there
the
presence
of
breakers
might
be
detected
in
the
graceful
streaks
of
foam
upon
the
surface
of
the
waters
a
sound
came
from
the
sea
like
the
murmuring
of
bees
all
around
was
level
except
the
douvres
rising
straight
like
two
black
columns
up
to
a
certain
height
they
were
completely
bearded
with
seaweed
above
this
their
steep
haunches
glittered
at
points
like
polished
armour
they
seemed
ready
to
commence
the
strife
again
the
beholder
felt
that
they
were
rooted
deep
in
mountains
whose
summits
were
beneath
the
sea
their
aspect
was
full
of
a
sort
of
tragic
power
ordinarily
the
sea
conceals
her
crimes
she
delights
in
privacy
her
unfathomable
deeps
keep
silence
she
wraps
herself
in
a
mystery
which
rarely
consents
to
give
up
its
secrets
we
know
her
savage
nature
but
who
can
tell
the
extent
of
her
dark
deeds
she
is
at
once
open
and
secret
she
hides
away
carefully
and
cares
not
to
divulge
her
actions
wrecks
a
vessel
and
covering
it
with
the
waves
engulfs
it
deep
as
if
conscious
of
her
guilt
among
her
crimes
is
hypocrisy
she
slays
and
steals
conceals
her
booty
puts
on
an
air
of
unconsciousness
and
smiles
here
however
was
nothing
of
the
kind
the
douvres
lifting
above
the
level
of
the
waters
the
shattered
hull
of
the
durande
had
an
air
of
triumph
the
imagination
might
have
pictured
them
as
two
monstrous
arms
reaching
upwards
from
the
gulf
and
exhibiting
to
the
tempest
the
lifeless
body
of
the
ship
their
aspect
was
like
that
of
an
assassin
boasting
of
his
evil
deeds
the
solemnity
of
the
hour
contributed
something
to
the
impression
of
the
scene
there
is
a
mysterious
grandeur
in
the
dawn
as
of
the
between
the
region
of
consciousness
and
the
world
of
our
dreams
there
is
something
spectral
in
that
confused
transition
time
the
immense
form
of
the
two
douvres
like
a
capital
letter
h
the
durande
forming
its
cross
stroke
appeared
against
the
horizon
in
all
their
twilight
majesty
gilliatt
was
attired
in
his
seaman
clothing
a
guernsey
shirt
woollen
stockings
thick
shoes
a
homespun
jacket
trousers
of
thick
stuff
with
pockets
and
a
cap
upon
his
head
of
red
worsted
of
a
kind
then
much
in
use
among
sailors
and
known
in
the
last
century
as
a
he
recognised
the
rocks
and
steered
towards
them
the
situation
of
the
durande
was
exactly
the
contrary
of
that
of
a
vessel
gone
to
the
bottom
it
was
a
vessel
suspended
in
the
air
no
problem
more
strange
was
ever
presented
to
a
salvor
it
was
broad
daylight
when
gilliatt
arrived
in
the
waters
about
the
rock
as
we
have
said
there
was
but
little
sea
the
slight
agitation
of
the
water
was
due
almost
entirely
to
its
confinement
among
the
rocks
every
passage
small
or
large
is
subject
to
this
chopping
movement
the
inside
of
a
channel
is
always
more
or
less
white
with
foam
gilliatt
did
not
approach
the
douvres
without
caution
he
cast
the
sounding
lead
several
times
he
had
a
cargo
to
disembark
accustomed
to
long
absences
he
had
at
home
a
number
of
necessaries
always
ready
he
had
brought
a
sack
of
biscuit
another
of
a
basket
of
salt
fish
and
smoked
beef
a
large
can
of
fresh
water
a
norwegian
chest
painted
with
flowers
containing
several
coarse
woollen
shirts
his
tarpaulin
and
his
waterproof
overalls
and
a
sheepskin
which
he
was
accustomed
to
throw
at
night
over
his
clothes
on
leaving
the
bû
de
la
rue
he
had
put
all
these
things
hastily
into
the
barge
with
the
addition
of
a
large
loaf
in
his
hurry
he
had
brought
no
other
tools
but
his
huge
his
chopper
and
hatchet
and
a
knotted
rope
furnished
with
a
and
with
a
ladder
of
that
sort
the
steepest
rocks
become
accessible
and
a
good
sailor
will
find
it
possible
to
scale
the
rudest
escarpment
in
the
island
of
sark
the
visitor
may
see
what
the
fishermen
of
the
havre
gosselin
can
accomplish
with
a
knotted
cord
his
nets
and
lines
and
all
his
fishing
apparatus
were
in
the
barge
he
had
placed
them
there
mechanically
and
by
habit
for
he
intended
if
his
enterprise
continued
to
sojourn
for
some
time
in
an
archipelago
of
rocks
and
breakers
where
fishing
nets
and
tackle
are
of
little
use
at
the
moment
when
gilliatt
was
skirting
the
great
rock
the
sea
was
retiring
a
circumstance
favourable
to
his
purpose
the
departing
tide
laid
bare
at
the
foot
of
the
smaller
douvre
one
or
two
horizontal
or
only
slightly
inclined
and
bearing
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
boards
supported
by
crows
these
sometimes
narrow
sometimes
broad
standing
at
unequal
distances
along
the
side
of
the
great
perpendicular
column
were
continued
in
the
form
of
a
thin
cornice
up
to
a
spot
just
beneath
the
durande
the
hull
of
which
stood
swelling
out
between
the
two
rocks
the
wreck
was
held
fast
there
as
in
a
vice
this
series
of
platforms
was
convenient
for
approaching
and
surveying
the
position
it
was
convenient
also
for
disembarking
the
contents
of
the
barge
provisionally
but
it
was
necessary
to
hasten
for
it
was
only
above
water
for
a
few
hours
with
the
rising
tide
the
would
be
again
beneath
the
foam
it
was
before
these
some
level
some
slanting
that
gilliatt
pushed
in
and
brought
the
barge
to
a
stand
a
thick
mass
of
wet
and
slippery
covered
them
rendered
more
slippery
here
and
there
by
their
inclined
surfaces
gilliatt
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
sprang
on
to
the
slimy
weeds
and
made
fast
the
barge
to
a
point
of
rock
then
he
advanced
as
far
as
he
could
along
the
granite
cornice
reached
the
rock
immediately
beneath
the
wreck
looked
up
and
examined
it
the
durande
had
been
caught
suspended
and
as
it
were
fitted
in
between
the
two
rocks
at
about
twenty
feet
above
the
water
it
must
have
been
a
heavy
sea
which
had
cast
her
there
such
effects
from
furious
seas
have
nothing
surprising
for
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
ocean
to
cite
one
example
only
on
the
january
in
the
gulf
of
stora
a
tempest
struck
with
its
expiring
force
a
brig
and
casting
it
almost
intact
completely
over
the
broken
wreck
of
the
corvette
fixed
it
immovable
bowsprit
first
in
a
gap
between
the
cliffs
the
douvres
however
held
only
a
part
of
the
durande
the
vessel
snatched
from
the
waves
had
been
as
it
were
uprooted
from
the
waters
by
the
hurricane
a
whirlwind
had
wrenched
it
against
the
counteracting
force
of
the
rolling
waves
and
the
vessel
thus
caught
in
contrary
directions
by
the
two
claws
of
the
tempest
had
snapped
like
a
lath
the
with
the
engine
and
the
paddles
lifted
out
of
the
foam
and
driven
by
all
the
fury
of
the
cyclone
into
the
defile
of
the
douvres
had
plunged
in
up
to
her
midship
beam
and
remained
there
the
blow
had
been
well
directed
to
drive
it
in
this
fashion
between
the
two
rocks
the
storm
had
struck
it
as
with
an
enormous
hammer
the
forecastle
carried
away
and
rolled
down
by
the
sea
had
gone
to
fragments
among
the
breakers
the
hold
broken
in
had
scattered
out
the
bodies
of
the
drowned
cattle
upon
the
sea
a
large
portion
of
the
forward
side
and
bulwarks
still
hung
to
the
riders
by
the
larboard
and
by
some
shattered
braces
easy
to
strike
off
with
the
blow
of
a
hatchet
here
and
there
among
beams
planks
rags
of
canvas
pieces
of
chains
and
other
remains
of
wreck
were
seen
lying
about
among
the
rugged
fragments
of
shattered
rock
gilliatt
surveyed
the
durande
attentively
the
keel
formed
a
roofing
over
his
head
a
serene
sky
stretched
far
and
wide
over
the
waters
scarcely
wrinkled
with
a
passing
breath
the
sun
rose
gloriously
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
azure
circle
from
time
to
time
a
drop
of
water
was
detached
from
the
wreck
and
fell
into
the
sea
ii
a
catalogue
of
disasters
the
douvres
differed
in
shape
as
well
as
in
height
upon
the
little
douvre
which
was
curved
and
pointed
long
veins
of
rock
of
a
comparatively
soft
kind
could
be
seen
branching
out
and
dividing
the
interior
of
the
granite
at
the
edges
of
these
red
dykes
were
fractures
favourable
to
climbing
one
of
these
fractures
situated
a
little
above
the
wreck
had
been
so
laboriously
worn
and
scooped
out
by
the
splashing
of
the
waves
that
it
had
become
a
sort
of
niche
in
which
it
would
have
been
quite
possible
to
place
a
statue
the
granite
of
the
little
douvre
was
rounded
at
the
surface
and
to
the
feel
at
least
soft
like
touchstone
but
this
feeling
detracted
nothing
from
its
durability
the
little
douvre
terminated
in
a
point
like
a
horn
the
great
douvre
polished
smooth
glossy
perpendicular
and
looking
as
if
cut
out
by
the
builder
square
was
in
one
piece
and
seemed
made
of
black
ivory
not
a
hole
not
a
break
in
its
smooth
surface
the
escarpment
looked
inhospitable
a
convict
could
not
have
used
it
for
escape
nor
a
bird
for
a
place
for
its
nest
on
the
summit
there
was
a
horizontal
surface
as
upon
the
man
rock
but
the
summit
of
the
great
douvre
was
inaccessible
it
was
possible
to
scale
the
little
douvre
but
not
to
remain
on
the
summit
it
would
have
been
possible
to
rest
on
the
summit
of
the
great
douvre
but
impossible
to
scale
it
gilliatt
having
rapidly
surveyed
the
situation
of
affairs
returned
to
the
barge
landed
its
contents
upon
the
largest
of
the
horizontal
cornice
rocks
made
of
the
whole
compact
mass
a
sort
of
bale
which
he
rolled
up
in
tarpaulin
fitted
a
sling
rope
to
it
with
a
hoisting
block
pushed
the
package
into
a
corner
of
the
rocks
where
the
waves
could
not
reach
it
and
then
clutching
the
little
douvre
with
his
hands
and
holding
on
with
his
naked
feet
he
clambered
from
projection
to
projection
and
from
niche
to
niche
until
he
found
himself
level
with
the
wrecked
vessel
high
up
in
the
air
having
reached
the
height
of
the
paddles
he
sprang
upon
the
poop
the
interior
of
the
wreck
presented
a
mournful
aspect
traces
of
a
great
struggle
were
everywhere
visible
there
were
plainly
to
be
seen
the
frightful
ravages
of
the
sea
and
wind
the
action
of
the
tempest
resembles
the
violence
of
a
band
of
pirates
nothing
is
more
like
the
victim
of
a
criminal
outrage
than
a
wrecked
ship
violated
and
stripped
by
those
terrible
accomplices
the
the
thunder
the
rain
the
squall
the
waves
and
the
breakers
standing
upon
the
dismantled
deck
it
was
natural
to
dream
of
the
presence
of
something
like
a
furious
stamping
of
the
spirits
of
the
storm
everywhere
around
were
the
marks
of
their
rage
the
strange
contortions
of
certain
portions
of
the
ironwork
bore
testimony
to
the
terrific
force
of
the
winds
the
were
like
the
cell
of
a
lunatic
in
which
everything
has
been
broken
no
wild
beast
can
compare
with
the
sea
for
mangling
its
prey
the
waves
are
full
of
talons
the
north
wind
bites
the
billows
devour
the
waves
are
like
hungry
jaws
the
ocean
strikes
like
a
lion
with
its
heavy
paw
seizing
and
dismembering
at
the
same
moment
the
ruin
conspicuous
in
the
durande
presented
the
peculiarity
of
being
detailed
and
minute
it
was
a
sort
of
horrible
stripping
and
plucking
much
of
it
seemed
done
with
design
the
beholder
was
tempted
to
exclaim
what
wanton
mischief
the
ripping
of
the
planking
was
edged
here
and
there
artistically
this
peculiarity
is
common
with
the
ravages
of
the
cyclone
to
chip
and
tear
away
is
the
caprice
of
the
great
devastator
its
ways
are
like
those
of
the
professional
torturer
the
disasters
which
it
causes
wear
a
look
of
ingenious
punishments
one
might
fancy
it
actuated
by
the
worst
passions
of
man
it
refines
in
cruelty
like
a
savage
while
it
is
exterminating
it
dissects
bone
by
bone
it
torments
its
victim
avenges
itself
and
takes
delight
in
its
work
it
even
appears
to
descend
to
petty
acts
of
malice
cyclones
are
rare
in
our
latitudes
and
are
for
that
reason
the
more
dangerous
being
generally
unexpected
a
rock
in
the
path
of
a
heavy
wind
may
become
the
pivot
of
a
storm
it
is
probable
that
the
squall
had
thus
rotated
upon
the
point
of
the
douvres
and
had
turned
suddenly
into
a
waterspout
on
meeting
the
shock
of
the
rocks
a
fact
which
explained
the
casting
of
the
vessel
so
high
among
them
when
the
cyclone
blows
a
vessel
is
of
no
more
weight
in
the
wind
than
a
stone
in
a
sling
the
damage
received
by
the
durande
was
like
the
wound
of
a
man
cut
in
twain
it
was
a
divided
trunk
from
which
issued
a
mass
of
like
the
entrails
of
a
body
various
kinds
of
cordage
hung
floating
and
trembling
chains
swung
chattering
the
fibres
and
nerves
of
the
vessel
were
there
naked
and
exposed
what
was
not
smashed
was
disjointed
fragments
of
the
sheeting
resembled
currycombs
bristling
with
nails
everything
bore
the
appearance
of
ruin
a
handspike
had
become
nothing
but
a
piece
of
iron
a
nothing
but
a
lump
of
metal
a
had
become
a
mere
piece
of
wood
a
halliard
an
end
of
rope
a
strand
of
cord
a
tangled
skein
a
a
thread
in
the
hem
of
a
sail
all
around
was
the
lamentable
work
of
demolition
nothing
remained
that
was
not
unhooked
unnailed
cracked
wasted
warped
pierced
with
holes
destroyed
nothing
hung
together
in
the
dreadful
mass
but
all
was
torn
dislocated
broken
there
was
that
air
of
drift
which
characterises
the
scene
of
all
struggles
from
the
melées
of
men
which
are
called
battles
to
the
melées
of
the
elements
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
chaos
everything
was
sinking
and
dropping
away
a
rolling
mass
of
planks
panelling
ironwork
cables
and
beams
had
been
arrested
just
at
the
great
fracture
of
the
hull
whence
the
least
additional
shock
must
have
precipitated
them
into
the
sea
what
remained
of
her
powerful
frame
once
so
triumphant
was
cracked
here
and
there
showing
through
large
apertures
the
dismal
gloom
within
the
foam
from
below
spat
its
flakes
contemptuously
upon
this
broken
and
forlorn
outcast
of
the
sea
iii
sound
but
not
safe
gilliatt
did
not
expect
to
find
only
a
portion
of
the
ship
existing
nothing
in
the
description
in
other
respects
so
precise
of
the
captain
of
the
had
led
him
to
anticipate
this
division
of
the
vessel
in
the
centre
it
was
probable
that
the
diabolical
crash
heard
by
the
captain
of
the
marked
the
moment
when
this
destruction
had
taken
place
under
the
blows
of
a
tremendous
sea
the
captain
had
doubtless
worn
ship
just
before
this
last
heavy
squall
and
what
he
had
taken
for
a
great
sea
was
probably
a
waterspout
later
when
he
drew
nearer
to
observe
the
wreck
he
had
only
been
able
to
see
the
stern
of
the
vessel
the
remainder
that
is
to
say
the
large
opening
where
the
had
given
way
having
been
concealed
from
him
among
the
masses
of
rock
with
that
exception
the
information
given
by
the
captain
of
the
was
strictly
correct
the
hull
was
useless
but
the
engine
remained
intact
such
chances
are
common
in
the
history
of
shipwreck
the
logic
of
disaster
at
sea
is
beyond
the
grasp
of
human
science
the
masts
having
snapped
short
had
fallen
over
the
side
the
chimney
was
not
even
bent
the
great
iron
plating
which
supported
the
machinery
had
kept
it
together
and
in
one
piece
the
planks
of
the
were
disjointed
like
the
leaves
of
wooden
sunblinds
but
through
their
apertures
the
paddles
themselves
could
be
seen
in
good
condition
a
few
of
their
floats
only
were
missing
besides
the
machinery
the
great
stern
capstan
had
resisted
the
destruction
its
chain
was
there
and
thanks
to
its
firm
fixture
in
a
frame
of
joists
might
still
be
of
service
unless
the
strain
of
the
voyal
should
break
away
the
planking
the
flooring
of
the
deck
bent
at
almost
every
point
and
was
tottering
throughout
on
the
other
hand
the
trunk
of
the
hull
fixed
between
the
douvres
held
together
as
we
have
already
said
and
it
appeared
strong
there
was
something
like
derision
in
this
preservation
of
the
machinery
something
which
added
to
the
irony
of
the
misfortune
the
sombre
malice
of
the
unseen
powers
of
mischief
displays
itself
sometimes
in
such
bitter
mockeries
the
machinery
was
saved
but
its
preservation
did
not
make
it
any
the
less
lost
the
ocean
seemed
to
have
kept
it
only
to
demolish
it
at
leisure
it
was
like
the
playing
of
the
cat
with
her
prey
its
fate
was
to
suffer
there
and
to
be
dismembered
day
by
day
it
was
to
be
the
plaything
of
the
savage
amusements
of
the
sea
it
was
slowly
to
dwindle
and
as
it
were
to
melt
away
for
what
could
be
done
that
this
vast
block
of
mechanism
and
gear
at
once
massive
and
delicate
condemned
to
fixity
by
its
weight
delivered
up
in
that
solitude
to
the
destructive
elements
exposed
in
the
gripe
of
the
rock
to
the
action
of
the
wind
and
wave
could
under
the
frown
of
that
implacable
spot
escape
from
slow
destruction
seemed
a
madness
even
to
imagine
the
durande
was
the
captive
of
the
douvres
how
could
she
be
extricated
from
that
position
how
could
she
be
delivered
from
her
bondage
the
escape
of
a
man
is
difficult
but
what
a
problem
was
this
the
escape
of
a
vast
and
cumbrous
machine
iv
a
preliminary
survey
gilliatt
was
pressed
on
all
sides
by
demands
upon
his
labours
the
most
pressing
however
was
to
find
a
safe
mooring
for
the
barge
then
a
shelter
for
himself
the
durande
having
settled
down
more
on
the
larboard
than
on
the
starboard
side
the
right
was
higher
than
the
left
gilliatt
ascended
the
on
the
right
from
that
position
although
the
gut
of
rocks
stretching
in
abrupt
angles
behind
the
douvres
had
several
elbows
he
was
able
to
study
the
of
the
group
this
survey
was
the
preliminary
step
of
his
operations
the
douvres
as
we
have
already
described
them
were
like
two
high
forming
the
narrow
entrance
to
a
straggling
alley
of
small
cliffs
with
perpendicular
faces
it
is
not
rare
to
find
in
primitive
submarine
formations
these
singular
kinds
of
passages
which
seem
cut
out
with
a
hatchet
this
defile
was
extremely
tortuous
and
was
never
without
water
even
in
the
low
tides
a
current
much
agitated
traversed
it
at
all
times
from
end
to
end
the
sharpness
of
its
turnings
was
favourable
or
unfavourable
according
to
the
nature
of
the
prevailing
wind
sometimes
it
broke
the
swell
and
caused
it
to
fall
sometimes
it
exasperated
it
this
latter
effect
was
the
most
frequent
an
obstacle
arouses
the
anger
of
the
sea
and
pushes
it
to
excesses
the
foam
is
the
exaggeration
of
the
waves
the
stormy
winds
in
these
narrow
and
tortuous
passages
between
the
rocks
are
subjected
to
a
similar
compression
and
acquire
the
same
malignant
character
the
tempest
frets
in
its
sudden
imprisonment
its
bulk
is
still
immense
but
sharpened
and
contracted
and
it
strikes
with
the
massiveness
of
a
huge
club
and
the
keenness
of
an
arrow
it
pierces
even
while
it
strikes
down
it
is
a
hurricane
contracted
like
the
draught
through
the
crevice
of
a
door
the
two
chains
of
rocks
leaving
between
them
this
kind
of
street
in
the
sea
formed
stages
at
a
lower
level
than
the
douvres
gradually
decreasing
until
they
sunk
together
at
a
certain
distance
beneath
the
waves
there
was
another
such
gullet
of
less
height
than
the
gullet
of
the
douvres
but
narrower
still
and
which
formed
the
eastern
entrance
of
the
defile
it
was
evident
that
the
double
prolongation
of
the
ridge
of
rocks
continued
the
kind
of
street
under
the
water
as
far
as
the
man
rock
which
stood
like
a
square
citadel
at
the
extremity
of
the
group
at
low
water
indeed
which
was
the
time
at
which
gilliatt
was
observing
them
the
two
rows
of
sunken
rock
showed
their
tips
some
high
and
dry
and
all
visible
and
preserving
their
parallel
without
interruption
the
man
formed
the
boundary
and
buttressed
on
the
eastern
side
the
entire
mass
of
the
group
which
was
protected
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
two
douvres
the
whole
from
a
view
appeared
like
a
winding
chaplet
of
rocks
having
the
douvres
at
one
extremity
and
the
man
at
the
other
the
douvres
taken
together
were
merely
two
gigantic
shafts
of
granite
protruding
vertically
and
almost
touching
each
other
and
forming
the
crest
of
one
of
the
mountainous
ranges
lying
beneath
the
ocean
those
immense
ridges
are
not
only
found
rising
out
of
the
unfathomable
deep
the
surf
and
the
squall
had
broken
them
up
and
divided
them
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
only
the
tip
of
the
ridge
was
visible
this
was
the
group
of
rocks
the
remainder
which
the
waves
concealed
must
have
been
enormous
the
passage
in
which
the
storm
had
planted
the
durande
was
the
way
between
these
two
colossal
shafts
this
passage
zigzag
in
form
as
the
forked
lightning
was
of
about
the
same
width
in
all
parts
the
ocean
had
so
fashioned
it
its
eternal
commotion
produces
sometimes
those
singular
regularities
there
is
a
sort
of
geometry
in
the
action
of
the
sea
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
of
the
defile
the
two
parallel
granite
walls
confronted
each
other
at
a
distance
which
the
midship
frame
of
the
durande
measured
exactly
between
the
two
douvres
the
widening
of
the
little
douvre
curved
and
turned
back
as
it
was
had
formed
a
space
for
the
paddles
in
any
other
part
they
must
have
been
shattered
to
fragments
the
high
double
façade
of
rock
within
the
passage
was
hideous
to
the
sight
when
in
the
exploration
of
the
desert
of
water
which
we
call
the
ocean
we
come
upon
the
unknown
world
of
the
sea
all
is
uncouth
and
shapeless
so
much
as
gilliatt
could
see
of
the
defile
from
the
height
of
the
wreck
was
appalling
in
the
rocky
gorges
of
the
ocean
we
may
often
trace
a
strange
permanent
impersonation
of
shipwreck
the
defile
of
the
douvres
was
one
of
these
gorges
and
its
effect
was
exciting
to
the
imagination
the
oxydes
of
the
rock
showed
on
the
escarpment
here
and
there
in
red
places
like
marks
of
clotted
blood
it
resembled
the
splashes
on
the
walls
of
an
abattoir
associations
of
the
haunted
the
place
the
rough
marine
stones
diversely
tinted
here
by
the
decomposition
of
metallic
amalgams
mingling
with
the
rock
there
by
the
mould
of
dampness
manifested
in
places
by
purple
scales
hideous

ideas
of
murder
and

it
was
like
the
unwashed
walls
of
a
chamber
which
had
been
the
scene
of
an
assassination
or
it
might
have
been
imagined
that
men
had
been
crushed
to
death
there
leaving
traces
of
their
fate
the
peaked
rocks
produced
an
indescribable
impression
of
accumulated
agonies
certain
spots
appeared
to
be
still
dripping
with
the
carnage
here
the
wall
was
wet
and
it
looked
impossible
to
touch
it
without
leaving
the
fingers
bloody
the
blight
of
massacre
seemed
everywhere
at
the
base
of
the
double
parallel
escarpment
scattered
along
the
edge
or
just
below
the

or
in
the
worn
hollows
of
the
rocks
were
monstrous
rounded
masses
of
shingle
some
scarlet
others
black
or
purple
which
bore
a
strange
resemblance
to
internal
organs
of
the

they
might
have
been
taken
for
human
lungs
or
heart
or

scattered
and
putrefying

dismal

giants
might
have

disembowelled

long
red

which
might
have
been

such
aspects
are
frequent
in

caverns
v
a
word
upon
the
secret
of
the
elements
those
who
by
the
disastrous
chances
of
happen
to
be
condemned
to
a
temporary
habitation
upon
a
rock
in
find
that
the
form
of
their
inhospitable
refuge
is
by
no
means
a
matter
of
indifference
there
is
the
rock
a
single
peak
rising
from
the
water
there
is
the
circle
rock
somewhat
resembling
a
round
of
great
stones
and
there
is
the
the
latter
is
the
most
alarming
of
all
it
is
not
only
the
ceaseless
agony
of
the
waves
between
its
walls
or
the
tumult
of
the
imprisoned
sea
there
are
also
certain
obscure
meteorological
characteristics
which
appear
to
appertain
to
this
parallelism
of
two
marine
rocks
the
two
straight
sides
seem
a
veritable
electric
battery
the
first
result
of
the
peculiar
position
of
these
is
an
action
upon
the
air
and
the
water
the
acts
upon
the
waves
and
the
wind
mechanically
by
its
form
galvanically
by
the
different
magnetic
action
rendered
possible
by
its
vertical
height
its
masses
in
juxtaposition
and
contrary
to
each
other
this
form
of
rock
attracts
to
itself
all
the
forces
scattered
in
the
winds
and
exercises
over
the
tempest
a
singular
power
of
concentration
hence
there
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
breakers
a
certain
accentuation
of
storms
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
wind
is
composite
the
wind
is
believed
to
be
simple
but
it
is
by
no
means
simple
its
power
is
not
merely
dynamic
it
is
chemical
also
but
this
is
not
all
it
is
magnetic
its
effects
are
often
inexplicable
the
wind
is
as
much
electrical
as

the

sometimes

at

the

ten

of

such
is
the

which
presents

then
there
is
a

not

in

nearly
half

up

was
sufficiently
familiar
with
marine
rocks
to
grapple
in
earnest
with
the
douvres
before
all
as
we
have
just
said
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
safe
shelter
for
the
barge
the
double
row
of
reefs
which
stretched
in
a
sinuous
form
behind
the
douvres
connected
itself
here
and
there
with
other
rocks
and
suggested
the
existence
of
blind
passages
and
hollows
opening
out
into
the
straggling
way
and
joining
again
to
the
principal
defile
like
branches
to
a
trunk
the
lower
part
of
these
rocks
was
covered
with
kelp
the
upper
part
with
lichens
the
uniform
level
of
the
seaweed
marked
the
line
of
the
water
at
the
height
of
the
tide
and
the
limit
of
the
sea
in
calm
weather
the
points
which
the
water
had
not
touched
presented
those
silver
and
golden
hues
communicated
to
marine
granite
by
the
white
and
yellow
lichen
a
crust
of
conoidical
shells
covered
the
rock
at
certain
points
the
dry
rot
of
the
granite
at
other
points
in
the
retreating
angles
where
fine
sand
had
accumulated
ribbed
on
its
surface
rather
by
the
wind
than
by
the
waves
appeared
tufts
of
blue
thistles
in
the
indentations
sheltered
from
the
winds
could
be
traced
the
little
perforations
made
by
the
this
shelly
mass
of
prickles
which
moves
about
a
living
ball
by
rolling
on
its
spines
and
the
armour
of
which
is
composed
of
ten
thousand
pieces
artistically
adjusted
and
welded
together
the
which
is
popularly
called
for
some
unknown
reason
aristotle
lantern
wears
away
the
granite
with
his
five
teeth
and
lodges
himself
in
the
hole
it
is
in
such
holes
that
the
samphire
gatherers
find
them
they
cut
them
in
halves
and
eat
them
raw
like
an
oyster
some
steep

soft

hence
its

the
tips
of
the
further
reefs
left
out
of
the
water
by
the
receding
tide
extended
close
under
the
escarpment
of
the
man
to
a
sort
of
creek
enclosed
nearly
on
all
sides
by
rocky
walls
here
was
evidently
a
possible
harbourage
it
had
the
form
of
a
and
opened
only
on
one
side
to
the
east
wind
which
is
the
least
violent
of
all
winds
in
that
sea
labyrinth
the
water
was
shut
in
there
and
almost
motionless
the
shelter
seemed
comparatively
safe
gilliatt
moreover
had
not
much
choice
if
he
wished
to
take
advantage
of
the
low
water
it
was
important
to
make
haste
the
weather
continued
to
be
fine
and
calm
the
insolent
sea
was
for
a
while
in
a
gentle
mood
gilliatt
descended
put
on
his
shoes
again
unmoored
the
cable
and
pushed
out
into
the
water
he
used
the
oars
coasting
the
side
of
the
rock
having
reached
the
man
rock
he
examined
the
entrance
to
the
little
creek
a
fixed
wavy
line
in
the
motionless
sea
a
sort
of
wrinkle
imperceptible
to
any
eye
but
that
of
a
sailor
marked
the
channel
gilliatt
studied
for
a
moment
its
lineament
almost
indistinct
under
the
water
then
he
held
off
a
little
in
order
to
veer
at
ease
and
steer
well
into
channel
and
suddenly
with
a
stroke
of
the
oars
he
entered
the
little
bay
he
sounded
the
anchorage
appeared
to
be
excellent
the
sloop
would
be
protected
there
against
almost
any
of
the
contingencies
of
the
season
the
most
formidable
reefs
have
quiet
nooks
of
this
sort
the
ports
which
are
thus
found
among
the
breakers
are
like
the
hospitality
of
the
fierce
bedouin
friendly
and
sure
gilliatt
placed
the
sloop
as
near
as
he
could
to
the
man
but
still
far
enough
to
escape
grazing
the
rock
and
he
cast
his
two
anchors
that
done
he
crossed
his
arms
and
reflected
on
his
position
the
sloop
was
sheltered
here
was
one
problem
solved
but
another
remained
where
could
he
now
shelter
himself
he
had
the
choice
of
two
places
the
sloop
itself
with
its
corner
of
cabin
which
was
scarcely
habitable
and
the
summit
of
the
man
rock
which
was
not
difficult
to
scale
from
one
or
other
of
these
refuges
it
was
possible
at
low
water
by
jumping
from
rock
to
rock
to
gain
the
passage
between
the
douvres
where
the
durande
was
fixed
almost
without
wetting
the
feet
but
low
water
lasts
but
a
short
while
and
all
the
rest
of
the
time
he
would
be
cut
off
either
from
his
shelter
or
from
the
wreck
by
more
than
two
hundred
fathoms
swimming
among
breakers
is
difficult
at
all
times
if
there
is
the
least
commotion
in
the
sea
it
is
impossible
he
was
driven
to
give
up
the
idea
of
shelter
in
the
sloop
or
on
the
man
no
was
possible
among
the
neighbouring
rocks
the
summits
of
the
lower
ones
disappeared
twice
a
day
beneath
the
rising
tide
the
summits
of
the
higher
ones
were
constantly
swept
by
the
flakes
of
foam
and
promised
nothing
but
an
inhospitable
drenching
no
choice
remained
but
the
wreck
itself
was
it
possible
to
seek
refuge
there
gilliatt
hoped
it
might
be
vii
a
chamber
for
the
voyager
afterwards
gilliatt
having
returned
to
the
wreck
climbed
to
the
deck
went
below
and
descended
into
the
hold
completing
the
summary
survey
of
his
first
visit
by
the
help
of
the
capstan
he
had
raised
to
the
deck
of
the
durande
the
package
which
he
had
made
of
the
lading
of
the
sloop
the
capstan
had
worked
well
bars
for
turning
it
were
not
wanting
gilliatt
had
only
to
take
his
choice
among
the
heap
of
wreck
he
found
among
the
fragments
a
chisel
dropped
no
doubt
from
the
carpenter
box
and
which
he
added
to
his
little
stock
of
tools
besides
this
for
in
poverty
of
appliances
so
complete
everything
counts
for
a
little
he
had
his
in
his
pocket
gilliatt
worked
the
whole
day
long
on
the
wreck
clearing
away
propping
arranging
at
nightfall
he
observed
the
following
facts
the
entire
wreck
shook
in
the
wind
the
carcass
trembled
at
every
step
he
took
there
was
nothing
stable
or
strong
except
the
portion
of
the
hull
jammed
between
the
rocks
which
contained
the
engine
there
the
beams
were
powerfully
supported
by
the
granite
walls
fixing
his
home
in
the
durande
would
be
imprudent
it
would
increase
the
weight
but
far
from
adding
to
her
burden
it
was
important
to
lighten
it
to
burden
the
wreck
in
any
way
was
indeed
the
very
contrary
of
what
he
wanted
the
mass
of
ruin
required
in
fact
the
most
careful
management
it
was
like
a
sick
man
at
the
approach
of
dissolution
the
wind
would
do
sufficient
to
help
it
to
its
end
it
was
moreover
unfortunate
enough
to
be
compelled
to
work
there
the
amount
of
disturbance
which
the
wreck
would
have
to
withstand
would
necessarily
distress
it
perhaps
beyond
its
strength
besides
if
any
accident
should
happen
in
the
night
while
gilliatt
was
sleeping
he
must
necessarily
perish
with
the
vessel
no
assistance
was
possible
all
would
be
over
in
order
to
help
the
shattered
vessel
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
remain
outside
it
how
to
be
outside
and
yet
near
it
this
was
the
problem
the
difficulty
became
more
complicated
as
he
considered
it
where
could
he
find
a
shelter
under
such
conditions
gilliatt
reflected
there
remained
nothing
but
the
two
douvres
they
seemed
hopeless
enough
from
below
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
upon
the
upper
plateau
of
the
great
douvre
a
sort
of
protuberance
high
rocks
with
flattened
summits
like
the
great
douvre
and
the
man
are
a
sort
of
decapitated
peaks
they
abound
among
the
mountains
and
in
the
ocean
certain
rocks
particularly
those
which
are
met
with
in
the
open
sea
bear
marks
like
trees
they
have
the
appearance
of
having
received
blows
from
a
hatchet
they
have
been
subjected
in
fact
to
the
blows
of
the
gale
that
indefatigable
pioneer
of
the
sea
there
are
other
still
more
profound
causes
of
marine
convulsions
hence
the
innumerable
bruises
upon
these
primeval
masses
of
granite
some
of
these
sea
giants
have
their
heads
struck
off
sometimes
these
heads
from
some
inexplicable
cause
do
not
fall
but
remain
shattered
on
the
summit
of
the
mutilated
trunk
this
singularity
is
by
no
means
rare
the
devil
rock
at
guernsey
and
the
table
in
the
valley
of
anweiler
illustrate
some
of
the
most
surprising
features
of
this
strange
geological
enigma
some
such
phenomena
had
probably
fashioned
the
summit
of
the
great
douvre
if
the
protuberance
which
could
be
observed
on
the
plateau
were
not
a
natural
irregularity
in
the
stone
it
must
necessarily
be
some
remaining
fragment
of
the
shattered
summit
perhaps
the
fragment
might
contain
some
excavation
some
hole
into
which
a
man
could
creep
for
cover
gilliatt
asked
for
no
more
but
how
could
he
reach
the
plateau
how
could
he
scale
that
perpendicular
wall
hard
and
polished
as
a
pebble
half
covered
with
the
growth
of
glutinous
confervæ
and
having
the
slippery
look
of
a
soapy
surface
the
ridge
of
the
plateau
was
at
least
thirty
feet
above
the
deck
of
the
durande
gilliatt
took
out
of
his
box
of
tools
the
knotted
cord
hooked
it
to
his
belt
by
the
grapnel
and
set
to
work
to
scale
the
little
douvre
the
ascent
became
more
difficult
as
he
climbed
he
had
forgotten
to
take
off
his
shoes
a
fact
which
increased
the
difficulty
with
great
labour
and
straining
however
he
reached
the
point
safely
arrived
there
he
raised
himself
and
stood
erect
there
was
scarcely
room
for
his
two
feet
to
make
it
his
lodging
would
be
difficult
a
stylite
might
have
contented
himself
there
gilliatt
more
luxurious
in
his
requirements
wanted
something
more
commodious
the
little
douvre
leaning
towards
the
great
one
looked
from
a
distance
as
if
it
was
saluting
it
and
the
space
between
the
douvres
which
was
some
score
of
feet
below
was
only
eight
or
ten
at
the
highest
points
from
the
spot
to
which
he
had
climbed
gilliatt
saw
more
distinctly
the
rocky
excrescence
which
partly
covered
the
plateau
of
the
great
douvre
this
plateau
rose
three
fathoms
at
least
above
his
head
a
precipice
separated
him
from
it
the
curved
escarpment
of
the
little
douvre
sloped
away
out
of
sight
beneath
him
he
detached
the
knotted
rope
from
his
belt
took
a
rapid
glance
at
the
dimensions
of
the
rock
and
slung
the
grapnel
up
to
the
plateau
the
grapnel
scratched
the
rock
and
slipped
the
knotted
rope
with
the
hooks
at
its
end
fell
down
beneath
his
feet
swinging
against
the
side
of
the
little
douvre
he
renewed
the
attempt
slung
the
rope
further
aiming
at
the
granite
protuberance
in
which
he
could
perceive
crevices
and
scratches
the
cast
was
this
time
so
neat
and
skilful
that
the
hooks
caught
he
pulled
from
below
a
portion
of
the
rock
broke
away
and
the
knotted
rope
with
its
heavy
iron
came
down
once
more
striking
the
escarpment
beneath
his
feet
he
slung
the
grapnel
a
third
time
it
did
not
fall
he
put
a
strain
upon
the
rope
it
resisted
the
grapnel
was
firmly
anchored
the
hooks
had
caught
in
some
fracture
of
the
plateau
which
he
could
not
see
it
was
necessary
to
trust
his
life
to
that
unknown
support
he
did
not
hesitate
the
matter
was
urgent
he
was
compelled
to
take
the
shortest
route
moreover
to
descend
again
to
the
deck
of
the
durande
in
order
to
devise
some
other
step
was
impossible
a
slip
was
probable
and
a
fall
almost
certain
it
was
easier
to
climb
than
to
descend
gilliatt
movements
were
decisive
as
are
those
of
all
good
sailors
he
never
wasted
force
he
always
proportioned
his
efforts
to
the
work
in
hand
hence
the
prodigies
of
strength
which
he
executed
with
ordinary
muscles
his
biceps
were
no
more
powerful
than
that
of
ordinary
men
but
his
heart
was
firmer
he
added
in
fact
to
strength
which
is
physical
energy
which
belongs
to
the
moral
faculties
the
feat
to
be
accomplished
was
appalling
it
was
to
cross
the
space
between
the
two
douvres
hanging
only
by
this
slender
line
oftentimes
in
the
path
of
duty
and
devotedness
the
figure
of
death
rises
before
men
to
present
these
terrible
questions
wilt
thou
do
this
asks
the
shadow
gilliatt
tested
the
cord
again
the
held
firm
wrapping
his
left
hand
in
his
handkerchief
he
grasped
the
knotted
cord
with
his
right
hand
which
he
covered
with
his
left
then
stretching
out
one
foot
and
striking
out
sharply
with
the
other
against
the
rock
in
order
that
the
impetus
might
prevent
the
rope
twisting
he
precipitated
himself
from
the
height
of
the
little
douvre
on
to
the
escarpment
of
the
great
one
the
shock
was
severe
there
was
a
rebound
his
clenched
fists
struck
the
rocks
in
their
turn
the
handkerchief
had
loosened
and
they
were
scratched
they
had
indeed
narrowly
escaped
being
crushed
gilliatt
remained
hanging
there
a
moment
dizzy
he
was
sufficiently
master
of
himself
not
to
let
go
his
hold
of
the
cord
a
few
moments
passed
in
jerks
and
oscillations
before
he
could
catch
the
cord
with
his
feet
but
he
succeeded
at
last
recovering
himself
and
holding
the
cord
at
last
between
his
naked
feet
as
with
two
hands
he
gazed
into
the
depth
below
he
had
no
anxiety
about
the
length
of
the
cord
which
had
many
a
time
served
him
for
great
heights
the
cord
in
fact
trailed
upon
the
deck
of
the
durande
assured
of
being
able
to
descend
again
he
began
to
climb
hand
over
hand
and
still
clinging
with
his
feet
in
a
few
moments
he
had
gained
the
summit
never
before
had
any
creature
without
wings
found
a
footing
there
the
plateau
was
covered
in
parts
with
the
dung
of
birds
it
was
an
irregular
trapezium
a
mass
struck
off
from
the
colossal
granitic
prism
of
the
great
douvre
this
block
was
hollowed
in
the
centre
like
a
basin
a
work
of
the
rain
gilliatt
in
fact
had
guessed
correctly
at
the
southern
angle
of
the
block
he
found
a
mass
of
superimposed
rocks
probably
fragments
of
the
fallen
summit
these
rocks
looking
like
a
heap
of
giant
would
have
left
room
for
a
wild
beast
if
one
could
have
found
its
way
there
to
secrete
himself
between
them
they
supported
themselves
confusedly
one
against
the
other
leaving
interstices
like
a
heap
of
ruins
they
formed
neither
grottoes
nor
caves
but
the
pile
was
full
of
holes
like
a
sponge
one
of
these
holes
was
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
this
recess
had
a
flooring
of
moss
and
a
few
tufts
of
grass
gilliatt
could
fit
himself
in
it
as
in
a
kind
of
sheath
the
recess
at
its
entrance
was
about
two
feet
high
it
contracted
towards
the
bottom
stone
coffins
sometimes
have
this
form
the
mass
of
rocks
behind
lying
towards
the
the
recess
was
sheltered
from
the
showers
but
was
open
to
the
cold
north
wind
gilliatt
was
satisfied
with
the
place
the
two
chief
problems
were
solved
the
sloop
had
a
harbour
and
he
had
found
a
shelter
the
chief
merit
of
his
cave
was
its
accessibility
from
the
wreck
the
of
the
knotted
cord
having
fallen
between
two
blocks
had
become
firmly
hooked
but
gilliatt
rendered
it
more
difficult
to
give
way
by
rolling
a
huge
stone
upon
it
he
was
now
free
to
operate
at
leisure
upon
the
durande
henceforth
he
was
at
home
the
great
douvre
was
his
dwelling
the
durande
was
his
workshop
nothing
was
more
simple
for
him
than
going
to
and
fro
ascending
and
descending
he
dropped
down
easily
by
the
knotted
cord
on
to
the
deck
the
day
work
was
a
good
one
the
enterprise
had
begun
well
he
was
satisfied
and
began
to
feel
hungry
he
untied
his
basket
of
provisions
opened
his
knife
cut
a
slice
of
smoked
beef
took
a
bite
out
of
his
brown
loaf
drank
a
draught
from
his
can
of
fresh
water
and
supped
admirably
to
do
well
and
eat
well
are
two
satisfactions
a
full
stomach
resembles
an
easy
conscience
this
supper
was
ended
and
there
was
still
before
him
a
little
more
daylight
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
begin
the
lightening
of
the
wreck
an
urgent
necessity
he
had
passed
part
of
the
day
in
gathering
up
the
fragments
he
put
on
one
side
in
the
strong
compartment
which
contained
the
machine
all
that
might
become
of
use
to
him
such
as
wood
iron
cordage
and
canvas
what
was
useless
he
cast
into
the
sea
the
cargo
of
the
sloop
hoisted
on
to
the
deck
by
the
capstan
compact
as
he
had
made
it
was
an
encumbrance
gilliatt
surveyed
the
species
of
niche
at
a
height
within
his
reach
in
the
side
of
the
little
douvre
these
natural
closets
not
shut
in
it
is
true
are
often
seen
in
the
rocks
it
struck
him
that
it
was
possible
to
trust
some
stores
to
this
depôt
and
he
accordingly
placed
in
the
back
of
the
recess
his
two
boxes
containing
his
tools
and
his
clothing
and
his
two
bags
holding
the
and
the
biscuit
in
the
front
a
little
too
near
the
edge
perhaps
but
he
had
no
other
place
he
rested
his
basket
of
provisions
he
had
taken
care
to
remove
from
the
box
of
clothing
his
sheepskin
his
loose
coat
with
a
hood
and
his
waterproof
overalls
to
lessen
the
hold
of
the
wind
upon
the
knotted
cord
he
made
the
lower
extremity
fast
to
one
of
the
riders
of
the
durande
the
durande
being
much
driven
in
this
rider
was
bent
a
good
deal
and
it
held
the
end
of
the
cord
as
firmly
as
a
tight
hand
there
was
still
the
difficulty
of
the
upper
end
of
the
cord
to
control
the
lower
part
was
well
but
at
the
summit
of
the
escarpment
at
the
spot
where
the
knotted
cord
met
the
ridge
of
the
plateau
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
it
would
be
fretted
and
worn
away
by
the
sharp
angle
of
the
rock
gilliatt
searched
in
the
heap
of
rubbish
in
reserve
and
took
from
it
some
rags
of
and
from
a
bunch
of
old
cables
he
pulled
out
some
strands
of
with
which
he
filled
his
pockets
a
sailor
would
have
guessed
that
he
intended
to
bind
with
these
pieces
of
and
ends
of
yarn
the
part
of
the
knotted
rope
upon
the
edge
of
the
rock
so
as
to
preserve
it
from
all
friction
an
operation
which
is
called
keckling
having
provided
himself
with
these
things
he
drew
on
his
overalls
over
his
legs
put
on
his
waterproof
coat
over
his
jacket
drew
its
hood
over
his
red
cap
hung
the
sheepskin
round
his
neck
by
the
two
legs
and
clothed
in
this
complete
panoply
he
grasped
the
cord
now
firmly
fixed
to
the
side
of
the
great
douvre
and
mounted
to
the
assault
of
that
sombre
citadel
in
the
sea
in
spite
of
his
scratched
hands
gilliatt
easily
regained
the
summit
the
last
pale
tints
of
sunset
were
fading
in
the
sky
it
was
night
upon
the
sea
below
a
little
light
still
lingered
upon
the
height
of
the
douvre
gilliatt
took
advantage
of
this
remains
of
daylight
to
bind
the
knotted
rope
he
wound
it
round
again
and
again
at
the
part
which
passed
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
with
a
bandage
of
several
thicknesses
of
canvas
strongly
tied
at
every
turn
the
whole
resembled
in
some
degree
the
padding
which
actresses
place
upon
their
knees
to
prepare
them
for
the
agonies
and
supplications
of
the
fifth
act
this
binding
completely
accomplished
gilliatt
rose
from
his
stooping
position
for
some
moments
while
he
had
been
busied
in
his
task
he
had
had
a
confused
sense
of
a
singular
fluttering
in
the
air
it
resembled
in
the
silence
of
the
evening
the
noise
which
an
immense
bat
might
make
with
the
beating
of
its
wings
gilliatt
raised
his
eyes
a
great
black
circle
was
revolving
over
his
head
in
the
pale
twilight
sky
such
circles
are
seen
in
pictures
round
the
heads
of
saints
these
however
are
golden
on
a
dark
ground
while
the
circle
around
gilliatt
was
dark
upon
a
pale
ground
the
effect
was
strange
it
spread
round
the
great
douvre
like
the
aureole
of
night
the
circle
drew
nearer
then
retired
grew
narrower
and
then
spread
wide
again
it
was
an
immense
flight
of
gulls
seamews
and
cormorants
a
vast
multitude
of
affrighted
sea
birds
the
great
douvre
was
probably
their
lodging
and
they
were
coming
to
rest
for
the
night
gilliatt
had
taken
a
chamber
in
their
home
it
was
evident
that
their
unexpected
disturbed
them
a
man
there
was
an
object
they
had
never
beheld
before
their
wild
flutter
continued
for
some
time
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
stranger
to
leave
the
place
gilliatt
followed
them
dreamily
with
his
eyes
the
flying
multitude
seemed
at
last
to
give
up
their
design
the
circle
suddenly
took
a
spiral
form
and
the
cloud
of
sea
birds
came
down
upon
the
man
rock
at
the
extremity
of
the
group
where
they
seemed
to
be
conferring
and
deliberating
gilliatt
after
settling
down
in
his
alcove
of
granite
and
covering
a
stone
for
a
pillow
for
his
head
could
hear
the
birds
for
a
long
time
chattering
one
after
the
other
or
croaking
as
if
in
turns
then
they
were
silent
and
all
were
sleeping
the
birds
upon
their
rock
gilliatt
upon
his
viii
importunæque
volucres
gilliatt
slept
well
but
he
was
cold
and
this
awoke
him
from
time
to
time
he
had
naturally
placed
his
feet
at
the
bottom
and
his
head
at
the
entrance
to
his
cave
he
had
not
taken
the
precaution
to
remove
from
his
couch
a
number
of
angular
stones
which
did
not
by
any
means
conduce
to
sleep
now
and
then
he
his
eyes
at
intervals
he
heard
loud
noises
it
was
the
rising
tide
entering
the
caverns
of
the
rocks
with
a
sound
like
the
report
of
a
cannon
all
the
circumstances
of
his
position
conspired
to
produce
the
effect
of
a
vision
hallucinations
seemed
to
surround
him
the
vagueness
of
night
increased
this
effect
and
gilliatt
felt
himself
plunged
into
some
region
of
unrealities
he
asked
himself
if
all
were
not
a
dream
then
he
dropped
to
sleep
again
and
this
time
in
a
veritable
dream
found
himself
at
the
bû
de
la
rue
at
the
bravées
at
sampson
he
heard
déruchette
singing
he
was
among
realities
while
he
slept
he
seemed
to
wake
and
live
when
he
awoke
again
he
appeared
to
be
sleeping
in
truth
from
this
time
forward
he
lived
in
a
dream
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
a
confused
murmur
filled
the
air
gilliatt
had
a
vague
consciousness
of
it
even
in
his
sleep
it
was
perhaps
a
breeze
arising
once
when
awakened
by
a
cold
shiver
he
opened
his
eyes
a
little
wider
than
before
clouds
were
moving
in
the
zenith
the
moon
was
flying
through
the
sky
with
one
large
star
following
closely
in
her
footsteps
gilliatt
mind
was
full
of
the
incidents
of
his
dreams
the
wild
outlines
of
things
in
the
darkness
were
exaggerated
by
this
confusion
with
the
impressions
of
his
sleeping
hours
at
daybreak
he
was
but
he
slept
soundly
the
sudden
daylight
aroused
him
from
a
slumber
which
might
have
been
dangerous
the
alcove
faced
the
rising
sun
gilliatt
yawned
stretched
himself
and
sprang
out
of
his
sleeping
place
his
sleep
had
been
so
deep
that
he
could
not
at
first
recall
the
circumstances
of
the
night
before
by
degrees
the
feeling
of
reality
returned
and
he
began
to
think
of
breakfast
the
weather
was
calm
the
sky
cool
and
serene
the
clouds
were
gone
the
night
wind
had
cleared
the
horizon
and
the
sun
rose
brightly
another
fine
day
was
commencing
gilliatt
felt
joyful
he
threw
off
his
overcoat
and
his
leggings
rolled
them
up
in
the
sheepskin
with
the
wool
inside
fastened
the
roll
with
a
length
of
and
pushed
it
into
the
cavern
for
a
shelter
in
case
of
rain
this
done
he
made
his
bed
an
operation
which
consisted
in
removing
the
stones
which
had
annoyed
him
in
the
night
his
bed
made
he
slid
down
the
cord
on
to
the
deck
of
the
durande
and
approached
the
niche
where
he
had
placed
his
basket
of
provisions
as
it
was
very
near
the
edge
the
wind
in
the
night
had
swept
it
down
and
rolled
it
into
the
sea
it
was
evident
that
it
would
not
be
easy
to
recover
it
there
was
a
spirit
of
mischief
and
malice
in
a
wind
which
had
sought
out
his
basket
in
that
position
it
was
the
commencement
of
hostilities
gilliatt
understood
the
token
to
those
who
live
in
a
state
of
rude
familiarity
with
the
sea
it
becomes
natural
to
regard
the
wind
as
an
individuality
and
the
rocks
as
sentient
beings
nothing
remained
but
the
biscuit
and
the
except
the
on
which
the
shipwrecked
sailor
had
supported
a
lingering
existence
upon
the
man
rock
it
was
useless
to
think
of
subsisting
by
net
or
line
fishing
fish
are
naturally
averse
to
the
neighbourhood
of
rocks
the
drag
and
bow
net
fishers
would
waste
their
labour
among
the
breakers
the
points
of
which
would
be
destructive
only
to
their
nets
gilliatt
breakfasted
on
a
few
limpets
which
he
plucked
with
difficulty
from
the
rocks
he
narrowly
escaped
breaking
his
knife
in
the
attempt
while
he
was
making
his
spare
meal
he
was
sensible
of
a
strange
disturbance
on
the
sea
he
looked
around
it
was
a
swarm
of
gulls
and
seamews
which
had
just
alighted
upon
some
low
rocks
and
were
beating
their
wings
tumbling
over
each
other
screaming
and
shrieking
all
were
swarming
noisily
upon
the
same
point
this
horde
with
beaks
and
talons
were
evidently
pillaging
something
it
was
gilliatt
basket
rolled
down
upon
a
sharp
point
by
the
wind
the
basket
had
burst
open
the
birds
had
gathered
round
immediately
they
were
carrying
off
in
their
beaks
all
sorts
of
fragments
of
provisions
gilliatt
recognised
from
the
distance
his
smoked
beef
and
his
salted
fish
it
was
their
turn
now
to
be
aggressive
the
birds
had
taken
to
reprisals
gilliatt
had
robbed
them
of
their
lodging
they
deprived
him
of
his
supper
ix
the
rock
and
how
gilliatt
used
it
a
week
passed
although
it
was
in
the
rainy
season
no
rain
fell
a
fact
for
which
gilliatt
felt
thankful
but
the
work
he
had
entered
upon
surpassed
in
appearance
at
least
the
power
of
human
hand
or
skill
success
appeared
so
improbable
that
the
attempt
seemed
like
madness
it
is
not
until
a
task
is
fairly
grappled
with
that
its
difficulties
and
perils
become
fully
manifest
there
is
nothing
like
making
a
commencement
for
making
evident
how
difficult
it
will
be
to
come
to
the
end
every
beginning
is
a
struggle
against
resistance
the
first
step
is
an
exorable
undeceiver
a
difficulty
which
we
come
to
touch
pricks
like
a
thorn
gilliatt
found
himself
immediately
in
the
presence
of
obstacles
in
order
to
raise
the
engine
of
the
durande
from
the
wreck
in
which
it
was
buried
with
any
chance
of
success
in
order
to
accomplish
a
salvage
in
such
a
place
and
in
such
a
season
it
seemed
almost
necessary
to
be
a
legion
of
men
gilliatt
was
alone
a
complete
apparatus
of
carpenters
and
engineers
tools
and
implements
were
wanted
gilliatt
had
a
saw
a
hatchet
a
chisel
and
a
hammer
he
wanted
both
a
good
workshop
and
a
good
shed
gilliatt
had
not
a
roof
to
cover
him
provisions
too
were
necessary
but
he
had
not
even
bread
any
one
who
could
have
seen
gilliatt
working
on
the
rock
during
all
that
first
work
might
have
been
puzzled
to
determine
the
nature
of
his
operations
he
seemed
to
be
no
longer
thinking
either
of
the
durande
or
the
two
douvres
he
was
busy
only
among
the
breakers
he
seemed
absorbed
in
saving
the
smaller
parts
of
the
shipwreck
he
took
advantage
of
every
high
tide
to
strip
the
reefs
of
everything
which
the
shipwreck
had
distributed
among
them
he
went
from
rock
to
rock
picking
up
whatever
the
sea
had
scattered
tatters
of
pieces
of
iron
splinters
of
panels
shattered
planking
broken
yards
here
a
beam
there
a
chain
there
a
pulley
at
the
same
time
he
carefully
surveyed
all
the
recesses
of
the
rocks
to
his
great
disappointment
none
were
habitable
he
had
suffered
from
the
cold
in
the
night
where
he
lodged
between
the
stones
on
the
summit
of
the
rock
and
he
would
gladly
have
found
some
better
refuge
two
of
those
recesses
were
somewhat
extensive
although
the
natural
pavement
of
rock
was
almost
everywhere
oblique
and
uneven
it
was
possible
to
stand
upright
and
even
to
walk
within
them
the
wind
and
the
rain
wandered
there
at
will
but
the
highest
tides
did
not
reach
them
they
were
near
the
little
douvre
and
were
approachable
at
any
time
gilliatt
decided
that
one
should
serve
him
as
a
storehouse
the
other
as
a
forge
with
all
the
sail
and
all
the
he
could
collect
he
made
packages
of
the
fragments
of
wreck
tying
up
the
wood
and
iron
in
bundles
and
the
canvas
in
parcels
he
lashed
all
these
together
carefully
as
the
rising
tide
approached
these
packages
he
began
to
drag
them
across
the
reefs
to
his
storehouse
in
the
hollow
of
the
rocks
he
had
found
a
top
rope
by
means
of
which
he
had
been
able
to
haul
even
the
large
pieces
of
timber
in
the
same
manner
he
dragged
from
the
sea
the
numerous
portions
of
chains
which
he
found
scattered
among
the
breakers
gilliatt
worked
at
these
tasks
with
astonishing
activity
and
tenacity
he
accomplished
whatever
he
attempted
nothing
could
withstand
his
perseverance
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
gathered
into
this
granite
warehouse
of
marine
stores
and
ranged
into
order
all
this
miscellaneous
and
shapeless
mass
of
salvage
there
was
a
corner
for
the
tacks
of
sails
and
a
corner
for
sheets
were
not
mixed
with
halliards
parrels
were
arranged
according
to
their
number
of
holes
the
coverings
of
unwound
from
the
broken
anchorings
were
tied
in
bunches
the
without
pulleys
were
separated
from
the
bullseyes
pendents
kevels
trusses
stoppers
sailbooms
if
they
were
not
completely
damaged
by
the
storm
occupied
different
compartments
all
the
uprights
stanchions
portlids
and
clamps
were
heaped
up
apart
wherever
it
was
possible
he
had
fixed
the
fragments
of
planks
from
the
bottom
one
in
the
other
there
was
no
confusion
between
and
nippers
of
the
cable
nor
of
with
towlines
nor
of
pulleys
of
the
small
with
pulleys
of
the
large
ropes
nor
of
fragments
from
the
waist
with
fragments
from
the
stern
a
place
had
been
reserved
for
a
portion
of
the
of
the
durande
which
had
supported
the
shrouds
of
the
topmast
and
the
every
portion
had
its
place
the
entire
wreck
was
there
classed
and
ticketed
it
was
a
sort
of
chaos
in
a
storehouse
a
fixed
by
huge
stones
served
though
torn
and
damaged
to
protect
what
the
rain
might
have
injured
shattered
as
were
the
bows
of
the
wreck
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
the
two
with
their
three
he
had
found
the
bowsprit
too
and
had
had
much
trouble
in
unrolling
its
gammoning
it
was
very
hard
and
tight
having
been
according
to
custom
made
by
the
help
of
the
windlass
and
in
dry
weather
gilliatt
however
persevered
until
he
had
detached
it
this
thick
rope
promising
to
be
very
useful
to
him
he
had
been
equally
successful
in
discovering
the
little
anchor
which
had
become
fast
in
the
hollow
of
a
reef
where
the
receding
tide
had
left
it
uncovered
in
what
had
been
tangrouille
cabin
he
had
found
a
piece
of
chalk
which
he
preserved
carefully
he
reflected
that
he
might
have
some
marks
to
make
a
and
several
pails
in
pretty
good
condition
completed
this
stock
of
working
materials
all
that
remained
of
the
store
of
coal
of
the
durande
he
carried
into
the
warehouse
in
a
week
this
salvage
of
débris
was
finished
the
rock
was
swept
clean
and
the
durande
was
lightened
nothing
remained
now
to
burden
the
hull
except
the
machinery
the
portion
of
the
bulwarks
which
hung
to
it
did
not
distress
the
hull
the
mass
hung
without
dragging
being
partly
sustained
by
a
ledge
of
rock
it
was
however
large
and
broad
and
heavy
to
drag
and
would
have
encumbered
his
warehouse
too
much
this
bulwarking
looked
something
like
a
stocks
gilliatt
left
it
where
it
was
he
had
been
profoundly
thoughtful
during
all
this
labour
he
had
sought
in
vain
for
the
the
doll
as
the
guernsey
folks
called
it
of
the
durande
it
was
one
of
the
things
which
the
waves
had
carried
away
for
ever
gilliatt
would
have
given
his
hands
to
find
it
if
he
had
not
had
such
peculiar
need
of
them
at
that
time
at
the
entrance
to
the
storehouse
and
outside
were
two
heaps
of
refuse
a
heap
of
iron
good
for
forging
and
a
heap
of
wood
good
for
burning
gilliatt
was
always
at
work
at
early
dawn
except
his
time
of
sleep
he
did
not
take
a
moment
of
repose
the
wild
sea
birds
flying
hither
and
thither
watched
him
at
his
work
x
the
forge
the
warehouse
completed
gilliatt
constructed
his
forge
the
other
recess
which
he
had
chosen
had
within
it
a
species
of
passage
like
a
gallery
in
a
mine
of
pretty
good
depth
he
had
had
at
first
an
idea
of
making
this
his
lodging
but
the
draught
was
so
continuous
and
so
persevering
in
this
passage
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
give
it
up
this
current
of
air
incessantly
renewed
first
gave
him
the
notion
of
the
forge
since
it
could
not
be
his
chamber
he
was
determined
that
this
cabin
should
be
his
smithy
to
bend
obstacles
to
our
purposes
is
a
great
step
towards
triumph
the
wind
was
gilliatt
enemy
he
had
set
about
making
it
his
servant
the
proverb
applied
to
certain
kinds
of
men
fit
for
everything
good
for
nothing
may
also
be
applied
to
the
hollows
of
rocks
they
give
no
advantages
gratuitously
on
one
side
we
find
a
hollow
fashioned
conveniently
in
the
shape
of
a
bath
but
it
allows
the
water
to
run
away
through
a
fissure
here
is
a
rocky
chamber
but
without
a
roof
here
a
bed
of
moss
but
oozy
with
wet
here
an
but
one
of
hard
stone
the
forge
which
gilliatt
intended
was
roughly
sketched
out
by
nature
but
nothing
could
be
more
troublesome
than
to
reduce
this
rough
sketch
to
manageable
shape
to
transform
this
cavern
into
a
laboratory
and
smith
shop
with
three
or
four
large
rocks
shaped
like
a
funnel
and
ending
in
a
narrow
fissure
chance
had
constructed
there
a
species
of
vast
blower
of
very
different
power
to
those
huge
old
forge
bellows
of
fourteen
feet
long
which
poured
out
at
every
breath
thousand
inches
of
air
this
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
construction
the
proportions
of
the
hurricane
can
not
be
definitely
measured
this
excess
of
force
was
an
embarrassment
the
incessant
draught
was
difficult
to
regulate
the
cavern
had
two
inconveniences
the
wind
traversed
it
from
end
to
end
so
did
the
water
this
was
not
the
water
of
the
sea
but
a
continual
little
trickling
stream
more
like
a
spring
than
a
torrent
the
foam
cast
incessantly
by
the
surf
upon
the
rocks
and
sometimes
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
had
filled
with
sea
water
a
natural
cave
situated
among
the
high
rocks
overlooking
the
excavation
the
overflowings
of
this
reservoir
caused
a
little
behind
the
escarpment
a
fall
of
water
of
about
an
inch
in
breadth
and
descending
four
or
five
fathoms
an
occasional
contribution
from
the
rains
also
helped
to
fill
the
reservoir
from
time
to
time
a
passing
cloud
dropped
a
shower
into
the
rocky
basin
always
overflowing
the
water
was
brackish
and
unfit
to
drink
but
clear
this
rill
of
water
fell
in
graceful
drops
from
the
extremities
of
the
long
marine
grasses
as
from
the
ends
of
a
length
of
hair
he
was
struck
with
the
idea
of
making
this
water
serve
to
regulate
the
draught
in
the
cave
by
the
means
of
a
funnel
made
of
planks
roughly
and
hastily
put
together
to
form
two
or
three
pipes
one
of
which
was
fitted
with
a
valve
and
of
a
large
tub
arranged
as
a
lower
reservoir
without
checks
or
counterweight
and
completed
solely
by
stuffing
above
and
below
gilliatt
who
as
we
have
already
said
was
handy
at
the
forge
and
at
the
mechanic
bench
succeeded
in
constructing
instead
of
the
which
he
did
not
possess
an
apparatus
less
perfect
than
what
is
known
by
the
name
of
a
cagniardelle
but
less
rude
than
what
the
people
of
the
pyrenees
anciently
called
a
trompe
he
had
some
and
he
manufactured
with
it
some
paste
he
had
also
some
white
rope
which
picked
out
into
tow
with
this
paste
and
tow
and
some
bits
of
wood
he
stopped
all
the
crevices
of
the
rock
leaving
only
a
little
air
passage
made
of
a
which
he
had
found
aboard
the
durande
and
which
had
served
for
loading
the
signal
gun
this
was
directed
horizontally
to
a
large
stone
which
gilliatt
made
the
hearth
of
the
forge
a
stopper
made
of
a
piece
of
tow
served
to
close
it
in
case
of
need
after
this
he
heaped
up
the
wood
and
coal
upon
the
hearth
struck
his
steel
against
the
bare
rock
caught
a
spark
upon
a
handful
of
loose
tow
and
having
ignited
it
soon
lighted
his
forge
fire
he
tried
the
blower
it
worked
well
gilliatt
felt
the
pride
of
a
cyclops
he
was
the
master
of
air
water
and
fire
master
of
the
air
for
he
had
given
a
kind
of
lungs
to
the
wind
and
changed
the
rude
draught
into
a
useful
blower
master
of
water
for
he
had
converted
the
little
cascade
into
a
trompe
master
of
fire
for
out
of
this
moist
rock
he
had
struck
a
flame
the
cave
being
almost
everywhere
open
to
the
sky
the
smoke
issued
freely
blackening
the
curved
escarpment
the
rocks
which
seemed
destined
for
ever
to
receive
only
the
white
foam
became
now
familiar
with
the
blackening
smoke
gilliatt
selected
for
an
anvil
a
large
smooth
round
stone
of
about
the
required
shape
and
dimensions
it
formed
a
base
for
the
blows
of
his
hammer
but
one
that
might
fly
and
was
very
dangerous
one
of
the
extremities
of
this
block
rounded
and
ending
in
a
point
might
for
want
of
anything
better
serve
instead
of
a
conoid
bicorn
but
the
other
kind
of
bicorn
of
the
pyramidal
form
was
wanting
it
was
the
ancient
stone
anvil
of
the
troglodytes
the
surface
polished
by
the
waves
had
almost
the
firmness
of
steel
he
regretted
not
having
brought
his
anvil
as
he
did
not
know
that
the
durande
had
been
broken
in
two
by
the
tempest
he
had
hoped
to
find
the
carpenter
chest
and
all
his
tools
generally
kept
in
the
forehold
but
it
was
precisely
the
of
the
vessel
which
had
been
carried
away
these
two
excavations
which
he
had
found
in
the
rock
were
contiguous
the
warehouse
and
the
forge
communicated
with
each
other
every
evening
when
his
work
was
ended
he
supped
on
a
little
biscuit
moistened
in
water
a
or
a
crab
or
a
few
de
the
only
food
to
be
found
among
those
rocks
and
shivering
like
his
knotted
cord
mounted
again
to
sleep
in
his
cell
upon
the
great
douvre
the
very
materialism
of
his
daily
occupation
increased
the
kind
of
abstraction
in
which
he
lived
to
be
steeped
too
deeply
in
realities
is
in
itself
a
cause
of
visionary
moods
his
bodily
labour
with
its
infinite
variety
of
details
detracted
nothing
from
the
sensation
of
stupor
which
arose
from
the
strangeness
of
his
position
and
his
work
ordinary
bodily
fatigue
is
a
thread
which
binds
man
to
the
earth
but
the
very
peculiarity
of
the
enterprise
he
was
engaged
in
kept
him
in
a
sort
of
ideal
twilight
region
there
were
times
when
he
seemed
to
be
striking
blows
with
his
hammer
in
the
clouds
at
other
moments
his
tools
appeared
to
him
like
arms
he
had
a
singular
feeling
as
if
he
was
repressing
or
providing
against
some
latent
danger
of
attack
untwisting
ropes
unravelling
threads
of
yarn
in
a
sail
or
propping
up
a
couple
of
beams
appeared
to
him
at
such
times
like
fashioning
engines
of
war
the
thousand
minute
pains
which
he
took
about
his
salvage
operations
produced
at
last
in
his
mind
the
effect
of
precautions
against
aggressions
little
concealed
and
easy
to
anticipate
he
did
not
know
the
words
which
express
the
ideas
but
he
perceived
them
his
instincts
became
less
and
less
those
of
the
worker
his
habits
more
and
more
those
of
the
savage
man
his
business
there
was
to
subdue
and
direct
the
powers
of
nature
he
had
an
indistinct
perception
of
it
a
strange
enlargement
of
his
ideas
around
him
far
as
eye
could
reach
was
the
vast
prospect
of
endless
labour
wasted
and
lost
nothing
is
more
disturbing
to
the
mind
than
the
contemplation
of
the
diffusion
of
forces
at
work
in
the
unfathomable
and
illimitable
space
of
the
ocean
the
mind
tends
naturally
to
seek
the
object
of
these
forces
the
unceasing
movement
in
space
the
unwearying
sea
the
clouds
that
seem
ever
hurrying
somewhere
the
vast
mysterious
prodigality
of
effort
all
this
is
a
problem
whither
does
this
perpetual
movement
tend
what
do
these
winds
construct
what
do
these
giant
blows
build
up
these
howlings
shocks
and
sobbings
of
the
storm
what
do
they
end
in
and
what
is
the
business
of
this
tumult
the
ebb
and
flow
of
these
questionings
is
eternal
as
the
flux
and
reflux
of
the
sea
itself
gilliatt
could
answer
for
himself
his
work
he
knew
but
the
agitation
which
surrounded
him
far
and
wide
at
all
times
perplexed
him
confusedly
with
its
eternal
questionings
unknown
to
himself
mechanically
by
the
mere
pressure
of
external
things
and
without
any
other
effect
than
a
strange
unconscious
bewilderment
gilliatt
in
this
dreamy
mood
blended
his
own
toil
somehow
with
the
prodigious
wasted
labour
of
the
how
indeed
in
that
position
could
he
escape
the
influence
of
that
mystery
of
the
dread
laborious
ocean
how
do
other
than
meditate
so
far
as
meditation
was
possible
upon
the
vacillation
of
the
waves
the
perseverance
of
the
foam
the
imperceptible
wearing
down
of
rocks
the
furious
beatings
of
the
four
winds
how
terrible
that
perpetual
recommencement
that
ocean
bed
those
clouds
all
that
travail
and
weariness
for
no
end
for
no
end
not
so
but
for
what
o

infinite

a
rock
near

sometimes
visited
by

any

no

no

and

above

and
its
sharp
points
below
nothing
is
to
be

there
but
inevitable
shipwreck
this
kind
of
rocks
which
in
the
old
sea
dialect
were
called
are
as
we
have
said
strange
places
the
sea
is
alone
there
she
works
her
own
will
no
token
of
terrestrial
life
disturbs
her
man
is
a
terror
to
the
sea
she
is
shy
of
his
approach
and
hides
from
him
her
deeds
but
she
is
bolder
among
the
lone
sea
rocks
the
everlasting
soliloquy
of
the
waves
is
not
troubled

she
labours
at
the
rock

its
damage

its
peaks

renews
them

pierces

down
the
soft
stone
and
denudes
the
hard
she
rummages

perforates
and

fills

with

herself

her
splendid

monstrous
vegetation

of
floating
plants
which

of

take

she
hides
away
all
this
terrible
magnificence
in
the
twilight
of
her
deeps
among
the
isolated
rocks
no

watches
over
her
no

it
is
there
that
she
develops
at

in

with

the

this
architecture
has
its
terrible
masterpieces
of
which
the
douvres
rock
was
one
the
sea
had
fashioned
and
perfected
it
with
a
sinister
solicitude
the
snarling
waters
licked
it
into
shape
it
was
hideous
treacherous
dark
full
of
hollows
it
had
a
complete
system
of
submarine
caverns
ramifying
and
losing
themselves
in
unfathomed
depths
some
of
the
orifices
of
this
labyrinth
of
passages
were
left
exposed
by
the
low
tides
a
man
might
enter
there
but
at
his
risk
and
peril
gilliatt
determined
to
explore
all
these
grottoes
for
the
purpose
of
his
salvage
labour
there
was
not
one
which
was
not
repulsive
everywhere
about
the
caverns
that
strange
aspect
of
an
abattoir
those
singular
traces
of
slaughter
appeared
again
in
all
the
exaggeration
of
the
ocean
no
one
who
has
not
seen
in
excavations
of
this
kind
upon
the
walls
of
everlasting
granite
these
hideous
natural
frescoes
can
form
a
notion
of
their
singularity
these
pitiless
caverns
too
were
false
and
sly
woe
betide
him
who
would
loiter
there
the
rising
tide
filled
them
to
their
roofs
rock
limpets
and
edible
mosses
abounded
among
them
they
were
obstructed
by
quantities
of
shingle
heaped
together
in
their
recesses
some
of
their
huge
smooth
stones
weighed
more
than
a
ton
they
were
of
every
proportion
and
of
every
hue
but
the
greater
part
were
blood
coloured
some
covered
with
a
hairy
and
glutinous
seaweed
seemed
like
large
green
moles
boring
a
way
into
the
rock
several
of
the
caverns
terminated
abruptly
in
the
form
of
a
others
main
arteries
of
a
mysterious
circulation
lengthened
out
in
the
rock
in
dark
and
tortuous
fissures
they
were
the
alleys
of
the
submarine
city
but
they
gradually
contracted
from
their
entrances
and
at
length
left
no
way
for
a
man
to
pass
peering
in
by
the
help
of
a
lighted
torch
he
could
see
nothing
but
dark
hollows
dripping
with
moisture
one
day
gilliatt
exploring
ventured
into
one
of
these
fissures
the
state
of
the
tide
favoured
the
attempt
it
was
a
beautiful
day
of
calm
and
sunshine
there
was
no
fear
of
any
accident
from
the
sea
to
increase
the
danger
two
necessities
as
we
have
said
compelled
him
to
undertake
these
explorations
he
had
to
gather
fragments
of
wreck
and
other
things
to
aid
him
in
his
labour
and
to
search
for
crabs
and
crayfish
for
his
food
had
begun
to
fail
him
on
the
rocks
the
fissure
was
narrow
and
the
passage
difficult
gilliatt
could
see
daylight
beyond
he
made
an
effort
contorted
himself
as
much
as
he
could
and
penetrated
into
the
cave
as
far
as
he
was
able
he
had
reached
without
suspecting
it
the
interior
of
the
rock
upon
the
point
of
which
clubin
had
steered
the
durande
though
abrupt
and
almost
inaccessible
without
it
was
hollowed
within
it
was
full
of
galleries
pits
and
chambers
like
the
tomb
of
an
egyptian
king
this
network
of
caverns
was
one
of
the
most
complicated
of
all
that
labyrinth
a
labour
of
the
water
the
undermining
of
the
restless
sea
the
branches
of
the
subterranean
maze
probably
communicated
with
the
sea
without
by
more
than
one
issue
some
gaping
at
the
level
of
the
waves
the
others
profound
and
invisible
it
was
near
here
but
gilliatt
knew
it
not
that
clubin
had
dived
into
the
sea
in
this
crocodile
cave
where
crocodiles
it
is
true
were
not
among
the
dangers
gilliatt
wound
about
clambered
struck
his
head
occasionally
bent
low
and
rose
again
lost
his
footing
and
regained
it
many
times
advancing
laboriously
by
degrees
the
gallery
widened
a
glimmer
of
daylight
appeared
and
he
found
himself
suddenly
at
the
entrance
to
a
cavern
of
a
singular
kind
xii
the
interior
of
an
edifice
under
the
sea
the
gleam
of
daylight
was
fortunate
one
step
further
and
gilliatt
must
have
fallen
into
a
pool
perhaps
without
bottom
the
waters
of
these
cavern
pools
are
so
cold
and
paralysing
as
to
prove
fatal
to
the
strongest
swimmers
there
is
moreover
no
means
of
remounting
or
of
hanging
on
to
any
part
of
their
steep
walls
he
stopped
short
the
crevice
from
which
he
had
just
issued
ended
in
a
narrow
and
slippery
projection
a
species
of
corbel
in
the
peaked
wall
he
leaned
against
the
side
and
surveyed
it
he
was
in
a
large
cave
over
his
head
was
a
roofing
not
unlike
the
inside
of
a
vast
skull
which
might
have
been
imagined
to
have
been
recently
dissected
the
dripping
ribs
of
the
striated
indentations
of
the
roof
seemed
to
imitate
the
branching
fibres
and
jagged
sutures
of
the
bony
cranium
a
stony
ceiling
and
a
watery
floor
the
rippled
waters
between
the
four
walls
of
the
cave
were
like
wavy
paving
tiles
the
grotto
was
shut
in
on
all
sides
not
a
window
not
even
an
visible
no
breach
in
the
wall
no
crack
in
the
roof
the
light
came
from
below
and
through
the
water
a
strange
sombre
light
gilliatt
the
pupils
of
whose
eyes
had
contracted
during
his
explorations
of
the
dusky
corridor
could
distinguish
everything
about
him
in
the
pale
glimmer
he
was
familiar
from
having
often
visited
them
with
the
caves
of
plémont
in
jersey
the
at
guernsey
the
boutiques
at
sark
but
none
of
these
marvellous
caverns
could
compare
with
the
subterranean
and
submarine
chamber
into
which
he
had
made
his
way
under
the
water
at
his
feet
he
could
see
a
sort
of
drowned
arch
this
arch
a
natural
ogive
fashioned
by
the
waves
was
glittering
between
its
two
dark
and
profound
supports
it
was
by
this
submerged
porch
that
the
daylight
entered
into
the
cavern
from
the
open
sea
a
strange
light
shooting
upward
from
a
gulf
the
glimmer
spread
out
beneath
the
waters
like
a
large
fan
and
was
reflected
on
the
rocks
its
direct
rays
divided
into
long
broad
shafts
appeared
in
strong
relief
against
the
darkness
below
and
becoming
brighter
or
more
dull
from
one
rock
to
another
looked
as
if
seen
here
and
there
through
plates
of
glass
there
was
light
in
that
cave
it
is
true
but
it
was
the
light
that
was
unearthly
the
beholder
might
have
dreamed
that
he
had
descended
in
some
other
planet
the
glimmer
was
an
enigma
like
the
glaucous
light
from
the
of
a
sphinx
the
whole
cave
represented
the
interior
of
a
of
enormous
proportions
and
of
a
strange
splendour
the
vault
was
the
hollow
of
the
brain
the
arch
the
mouth
the
sockets
of
the
eyes
were
wanting
the
cavern
alternately
swallowing
and
rendering
up
the
flux
and
reflux
through
its
mouth
wide
opened
to
the
full
noonday
without
seemed
to
drink
in
the
light
and
vomit
forth
bitterness
a
type
of
some
beings
intelligent
and
evil
the
light
in
traversing
this
inlet
through
the
vitreous
medium
of
the
became
green
like
a
ray
of
starlight
from
aldebaran
the
water
filled
with
the
moist
light
appeared
like
a
liquid
emerald
a
tint
of
of
marvellous
delicacy
spread
a
soft
hue
throughout
the
cavern
the
roof
with
its
cerebral
lobes
and
its
rampant
ramifications
like
the
fibres
of
nerves
gave
out
a
tender
reflection
of
chrysoprase
the
ripples
reflected
on
the
roof
were
falling
in
order
and
dissolving
again
incessantly
and
enlarging
and
contracting
their
glittering
scales
in
a
mysterious
and
mazy
dance
they
gave
the
beholder
an
impression
of
something
weird
and
spectral
he
wondered
what
prey
secured
or
what
expectation
about
to
be
realised
moved
with
a
joyous
thrill
this
magnificent
network
of
living
fire
from
the
projections
of
the
vault
and
the
angles
of
the
rock
hung
lengths
of
delicate
fibrous
plants
bathing
their
roots
probably
through
the
granite
in
some
upper
pool
of
water
and
distilling
from
their
silky
ends
one
after
the
other
a
drop
of
water
like
a
pearl
these
drops
fell
in
the
water
now
and
then
with
a
gentle
splash
the
effect
of
the
scene
was
singular
nothing
more
beautiful
could
be
imagined
nothing
more
mournful
could
anywhere
be
found
it
was
a
wondrous
palace
in
which
death
sat
smiling
and
content
xiii
what
was
seen
there
and
what
perceived
dimly
a
place
of
shade
which
yet
was
dazzling
to
the
eyes
such
was
this
surprising
cavern
the
beating
of
the
sea
made
itself
felt
throughout
the
cavern
the
oscillation
without
raised
and
depressed
the
level
of
the
waters
within
with
the
regularity
of
respiration
a
mysterious
spirit
seemed
to
fill
this
great
organism
as
it
swelled
and
subsided
in
silence
the
water
had
a
magical
transparency
and
gilliatt
distinguished
at
various
depths
submerged
recesses
and
surfaces
of
jutting
rocks
ever
of
a
deeper
and
a
deeper
green
certain
dark
hollows
too
were
there
probably
too
deep
for
soundings
on
each
side
of
the
submarine
porch
rude
elliptical
arches
filled
with
shallows
indicated
the
position
of
small
lateral
caves
low
alcoves
of
the
central
cavern
accessible
perhaps
at
certain
tides
these
openings
had
roofs
in
the
form
of
inclined
planes
and
at
angles
more
or
less
acute
little
sandy
beaches
of
a
few
feet
wide
laid
bare
by
the
action
of
the
water
stretched
inward
and
were
lost
in
these
recesses
here
and
there
seaweeds
of
more
than
a
fathom
in
length
undulated
beneath
the
water
like
the
waving
of
long
tresses
in
the
wind
and
there
were
glimpses
of
a
forest
of
sea
plants
above
and
below
the
surface
of
the
water
the
wall
of
the
cavern
from
top
to
bottom
from
the
vault
down
to
the
depth
at
which
it
became
invisible
was
tapestried
with
that
prodigious
efflorescence
of
the
sea
rarely
perceived
by
human
eyes
which
the
old
spanish
navigators
called
del
a
luxuriant
moss
having
all
the
tints
of
the
olive
enlarged
and
concealed
the
protuberances
of
granite
from
all
the
jutting
points
swung
the
thin
fluted
strips
of
varech
which
sailors
use
as
their
barometers
the
light
breath
which
stirred
in
the
cavern
waved
to
and
fro
their
glossy
bands
under
these
vegetations
there
showed
themselves
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
rarest
of
the
casket
of
the
ocean
ivory
shells
strombi
univalves
struthiolaires
turriculated
cerites
the
limpet
shells
like
tiny
huts
were
everywhere
adhering
to
the
rocks
distributed
in
settlements
in
the
alleys
between
which
prowled
oscabrions
those
beetles
of
the
sea
a
few
large
pebbles
found
their
way
into
the
cavern
took
refuge
there
the
crustacea
are
the
grandees
of
the
sea
who
in
their
lacework
and
embroidery
avoid
the
rude
contact
of
the
pebbly
crowd
the
glittering
heap
of
their
shells
in
certain
spots
under
the
wave
gave
out
singular
irradiations
amidst
which
the
eye
caught
glimpses
of
confused
azure
and
gold
and
of
every
tint
of
the
water
upon
the
side
of
the
cavern
a
little
above
the
a
magnificent
and
singular
plant
attaching
itself
like
a
fringe
to
the
border
of
seaweed
continued
and
completed
it
this
plant
thick
fibrous
inextricably
intertwined
and
almost
black
exhibited
to
the
eye
large
confused
and
dusky
festoons
everywhere
dotted
with
innumerable
little
flowers
of
the
colour
of
in
the
water
they
seemed
to
glow
like
small
blue
flames
out
of
the
water
they
were
flowers
beneath
it
they
were
sapphires
the
water
rising
and
inundating
the
basement
of
the
grotto
clothed
with
these
plants
seemed
to
cover
the
rock
with
gems
at
every
swelling
of
the
wave
these
flowers
increased
in
splendour
and
at
every
subsidence
grew
dull
again
so
it
is
with
the
destiny
of
man
aspiration
is
life
the
outbreathing
of
the
spirit
is
death
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
cavern
was
the
rock
itself
forming
here
a
wall
there
an
arch
and
here
again
a
pillar
or
pilaster
it
was
in
places
rough
and
bare
and
sometimes
close
beside
was
wrought
with
the
most
delicate
natural
carving
strange
evidences
of
mind
mingled
with
the
massive
stolidity
of
the
granite
it
was
the
wondrous
of
the
ocean
here
a
sort
of
panel
cut
square
and
covered
with
round
embossments
in
various
positions
simulated
a
vague
before
this
sculpture
with
its
obscure
designs
a
man
might
have
dreamed
of
prometheus
roughly
sketching
for
michael
angelo
it
seemed
as
if
that
great
genius
with
a
few
blows
of
his
mallet
could
have
finished
the
indistinct
labours
of
the
giant
in
other
places
the
rock
was
damasked
like
a
saracen
buckler
or
engraved
like
a
florentine
vase
there
were
portions
which
appeared
like
corinthian
brass
then
like
arabesques
as
on
the
door
of
a
mosque
then
like
runic
stones
with
obscure
and
mystic
prints
of
claws
plants
with
twisted
creepers
and
tendrils
crossing
and
recrossing
upon
the
groundwork
of
golden
lichens
covered
it
with
filigree
the
grotto
resembled
in
some
wise
a
moorish
palace
it
was
a
union
of
barbarism
and
of
goldsmith
work
with
the
imposing
and
rugged
architecture
of
the
elements
the
magnificent
stains
and
moulderings
of
the
sea
covered
as
with
velvet
the
angles
of
granite
the
escarpments
were
festooned
with
bindweed
sustaining
itself
with
graceful
ease
and
ornamenting
the
walls
as
by
intelligent
design
showed
their
strange
clusters
in
tasteful
arrangement
the
wondrous
light
which
came
from
beneath
the
water
at
once
a
submarine
twilight
and
an
elysian
radiance
softened
down
and
blended
all
harsh
lineaments
every
wave
was
a
prism
the
outlines
of
things
under
these
undulations
produced
the
chromatic
effects
of
optical
glasses
made
too
convex
solar
spectra
shot
through
the
waters
fragments
of
rainbows
seemed
floating
in
that
transparent
dawn
elsewhere
in
other
corners
there
was
discernible
a
kind
of
moonlight
in
the
water
every
kind
of
splendour
seemed
to
mingle
there
forming
a
strange
sort
of
twilight
nothing
could
be
more
perplexing
or
enigmatical
than
the
sumptuous
beauties
of
this
cavern
enchantment
reigned
over
all
the
fantastic
vegetation
the
rude
masonry
of
the
place
seemed
to
harmonise
it
was
a
happy
marriage
this
between
these
strange
wild
things
the
branches
seeming
but
to
touch
one
another
clung
closely
each
to
each
the
stern
rock
and
the
pale
flower
met
in
a
passionate
embrace
massive
pillars
had
capitals
and
entwining
wreaths
of
delicate
garlands
that
quivered
through
every
fibre
suggestive
of
fairy
fingers
tickling
the
feet
of
a
behemoth
and
the
rock
upheld
the
plant
and
the
plant
clasped
the
rock
with
unnatural
joy
of
attraction
the
effect
produced
by
the
mysterious
reconciliation
of
these
strange
forms
was
of
a
supreme
and
inexpressible
beauty
the
works
of
nature
not
less
than
the
works
of
genius
contain
the
absolute
and
produce
an
impression
of
awe
something
unexpected
about
them
imperiously
insists
on
our
mental
submission
we
are
conscious
of
a
premeditation
beyond
our
human
scope
and
at
no
time
are
they
more
startling
than
when
we
suddenly
become
aware
of
the
beauty
that
is
mingled
with
their
terror
this
hidden
grotto
was
if
we
may
use
the
expression
siderealised
there
was
everything
in
it
to
surprise
and
overwhelm
an
apocalyptic
light
illuminated
this
crypt
one
could
not
tell
if
that
which
the
eyes
looked
upon
was
a
reality
for
reality
bore
the
impress
of
the
impossible
one
could
see
and
touch
and
know
that
one
was
standing
there
and
yet
it
was
difficult
to
believe
in
it
all
was
it
daylight
which
entered
by
this
casement
beneath
the
sea
was
it
indeed
water
which
trembled
in
this
dusky
pool
were
not
these
arched
roofs
and
porches
fashioned
out
of
sunset
clouds
to
imitate
a
cavern
to
men
eyes
what
stone
was
that
beneath
the
feet
was
not
this
solid
shaft
about
to
melt
and
pass
into
thin
air
what
was
that
cunning
jewellery
of
glittering
shells
half
seen
beneath
the
wave
how
far
away
were
life
and
the
green
earth
and
human
faces
what
strange
enchantment
haunted
that
mystic
twilight
what
blind
emotion
mingling
its
sympathies
with
the
uneasy
restlessness
of
plants
beneath
the
wave
at
the
extremity
of
the
cavern
which
was
oblong
rose
a
cyclopean
archivolte
singularly
exact
in
form
it
was
a
species
of
cave
within
a
cave
of
tabernacle
within
a
sanctuary
here
behind
a
sheet
of
bright
verdure
interposed
like
the
veil
of
a
temple
arose
a
stone
out
of
the
waves
having
square
sides
and
bearing
some
resemblance
to
an
altar
the
water
surrounded
it
in
all
parts
it
seemed
as
if
a
goddess
had
just
descended
from
it
one
might
have
dreamed
there
that
some
celestial
form
beneath
that
crypt
or
upon
that
altar
dwelt
for
ever
pensive
in
naked
beauty
but
grew
invisible
at
the
approach
of
mortals
it
was
hard
to
conceive
that
majestic
chamber
without
a
vision
within
the
of
the
intruder
might
evoke
again
the
marvellous
apparition
a
flood
of
chaste
light
falling
upon
white
shoulders
scarcely
seen
a
forehead
bathed
with
the
light
of
dawn
an
olympian
visage
a
bust
full
of
mysterious
grace
arms
modestly
drooping
tresses
unloosened
in
the
aurora
a
body
delicately
modelled
of
pure
whiteness
in
a
sacred
cloud
with
the
glance
of
a
virgin
a
venus
rising
from
the
sea
or
eve
issuing
from
chaos
such
was
the
dream
which
filled
the
mind
it
seemed
improbable
that
no
phantom
figure
haunted
this
abode
some
woman
form
the
embodiment
of
a
star
had
no
doubt
but
shortly
left
the
altar
enveloped
in
this
atmosphere
of
mute
adoration
the
mind
pictured
an
amphitryon
a
tethys
some
diana
capable
of
passion
some
idealistic
figure
formed
of
light
looking
softly
down
in
the
surrounding
dusk
it
was
she
who
had
left
behind
in
the
cave
this
perfumed
luminosity
an
emanation
from
her
the
dazzling
phantom
was
no
longer
visible
she
was
only
revealed
by
the
invisible
and
the
sense
of
her
presence
lingered
setting
the
whole
being
voluptuously
the
goddess
had
departed
but
divinity
remained
the
beauty
of
the
recess
seemed
made
for
this
celestial
presence
it
was
for
the
sake
of
this
deity
this
fairy
of
the
pearl
caverns
this
queen
of
the
zephyrs
this
grace
born
of
the
waves
it
was
for
her
as
the
mind
at
least
imagined
that
this
subterranean
dwelling
had
been
thus
religiously
walled
in
so
that
nothing
might
ever
trouble
the
reverent
shadows
and
the
majestic
silence
round
about
that
divine
spirit
gilliatt
who
was
a
kind
of
seer
amid
the
secrets
of
nature
stood
there
musing
and
sensible
of
confused
emotions
suddenly
at
a
few
feet
below
him
in
the
delightful
transparence
of
that
water
like
liquid
jewels
he
became
sensible
of
the
approach
of
something
of
mystic
shape
a
species
of
long
ragged
band
was
moving
amidst
the
oscillation
of
the
waves
it
did
not
float
but
darted
about
of
its
own
will
it
had
an
object
was
advancing
somewhere
rapidly
the
object
had
something
of
the
form
of
a
jester
bauble
with
points
which
hung
flabby
and
undulating
it
seemed
covered
with
a
dust
incapable
of
being
washed
away
by
the
water
it
was
more
than
horrible
it
was
foul
the
beholder
felt
that
it
was
something
monstrous
it
was
a
living
thing
unless
indeed
it
were
but
an
illusion
it
seemed
to
be
seeking
the
darker
portion
of
the
cavern
where
at
last
it
vanished
the
heavy
shadows
grew
darker
as
its
sinister
form
glided
into
them
and
disappeared

the

difficult
going

succeeded
in
extricating
himself
but
he
did
not

there
he
had
found
nothing
of
what
he
was
in

of
and
he
had
not
the
time
to
indulge
curiosity
he
put
the
forge
in
operation
at
once
tools
were
wanting
he
set
to
work

made
them
for

he

sombre
labours
the

seemed
to
smile
upon
his

continued
to
be
dry
and
free
from
equinoctial
gales
the
month
of

of

the
gentleness
of

seemed
to
exclude

manufactured
for
himself
a

with
the
saw
he
attacked
the
wood
with
the

the

then
he
availed
himself
of
the

hands
of

the
pincers
and
the

the

the

is
like

the

like

by
degrees
he
made
for
himself
a
number
of
auxiliaries
and
constructed
his
armour
with
a
piece
of
he
made
a
screen
for
his
one
of
his
principal
labours
was
the
sorting
and
repair
of
pulleys
he
mended
both
the
blocks
and
the
sheaves
of
tackle
he
cut
down
the
irregularities
of
all
broken
joists
and
reshaped
the
extremities
he
had
as
we
have
said
for
the
necessities
of
his
carpentry
a
quantity
of
pieces
of
wood
stored
away
and
arranged
according
to
the
forms
the
dimensions
and
the
nature
of
their
grain
the

on
one
side
the
pine
on
the
other
the
short
pieces
like
riders
separated
from
the
straight
pieces
like
binding
strakes
this
formed
his
reserve
of
supports
and
levers
of
which
he
might
stand
in
great
need
at
any
moment
any
one
who
intends
to
construct
hoisting
tackle
ought
to
provide
himself
with
beams
and
small
cables
but
that
is
not
sufficient
he
must
have
cordage
gilliatt
restored
the
cables
large
and
small
he
frayed
out
the
tattered
sails
and
succeeded
in
converting
them
into
an
excellent
yarn
of
which
he
made
twine
with
this
he
joined
the
ropes
the
joins
however
were
liable
to
rot
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
hasten
to
make
use
of
these
cables
he
had
only
been
able
to
make
white
tow
for
he
was
without
tar
the
ropes
mended
he
proceeded
to
repair
the
chains
thanks
to
the
lateral
point
of
the
stone
anvil
which
served
the
part
of
the
conoid
bicorn
he
was
able
to
forge
rings
rude
in
shape
but
strong
with
these
he
fastened
together
the
severed
lengths
of
chains
and
made
long
pieces
to
work
at
a
forge
without
assistance
is
something
more
than
troublesome
he
succeeded
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
he
had
only
to
forge
and
shape
articles
of
comparatively
small
size
which
he
was
able
to
handle
with
the
pliers
in
one
hand
while
he
hammered
with
the
other
he
cut
into
lengths
the
iron
bars
of
the
captain
bridge
on
which
clubin
used
to
pass
to
and
fro
from
to
giving
his
orders
forged
at
one
extremity
of
each
piece
a
point
and
at
the
other
a
flat
head
by
this
means
he
manufactured
large
nails
of
about
a
foot
in
length
these
nails
much
used
in
pontoon
making
are
useful
in
fixing
anything
in
rocks
what
was
his
object
in
all
these
labours
we
shall
see
he
was
several
times
compelled
to
renew
the
blade
of
his
hatchet
and
the
teeth
of
his
saw
for
renotching
the
saw
he
had
manufactured
a
file
occasionally
he
made
use
of
the
capstan
of
the
durande
the
hook
of
the
chain
broke
he
made
another
by
the
aid
of
his
pliers
and
pincers
and
by
using
his
chisel
as
a
screwdriver
he
set
to
work
to
remove
the
two
of
the
vessel
an
object
which
he
accomplished
this
was
rendered
practicable
by
reason
of
a
peculiarity
in
their
construction
the
which
covered
them
served
him
to
stow
them
away
with
the
planks
of
these
he
made
two
cases
in
which
he
deposited
the
two
paddles
piece
by
piece
each
part
being
carefully
numbered
his
lump
of
chalk
became
precious
for
this
purpose
he
kept
the
two
cases
upon
the
strongest
part
of
the
wreck
when
these
preliminaries
were
completed
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
great
difficulty
the
problem
of
the
engine
of
the
durande
was
now
clearly
before
him
taking
the
to
pieces
had
proved
practicable
it
was
very
different
with
the
machinery
in
the
first
place
he
was
almost
entirely
ignorant
of
the
details
of
the
mechanism
working
thus
blindly
he
might
do
some
irreparable
damage
then
even
in
attempting
to
dismember
it
if
he
had
ventured
on
that
course
far
other
tools
would
be
necessary
than
such
as
he
could
fabricate
with
a
cavern
for
a
forge
a
for
bellows
and
a
stone
for
an
anvil
in
attempting
therefore
to
take
to
pieces
the
machinery
there
was
the
risk
of
destroying
it
the
attempt
seemed
at
first
sight
wholly
impracticable
the
apparent
impossibility
of
the
project
rose
before
him
like
a
stone
wall
blocking
further
progress
what
was
to
be
done
ii
wherein
shakespeare
and

gilliatt
had
a
notion
since
the
time
of
the
of
salbris
who
in
the
sixteenth
century
in
the
dark
ages
of
science
long
before
amontons
had
discovered
the
first
law
of
electricity
or
lahire
the
second
or
coulomb
the
third
without
other
helper
than
a
child
his
son
with
tools
in
the
chamber
of
the
great
clock
of
la
resolved
at
one
stroke
five
or
six
problems
in
statics
and
dynamics
inextricably
intervolved
like
the
wheels
in
a
block
of
carts
and
waggons
since
the
time
of
that
grand
and
marvellous
achievement
of
the
poor
workman
who
found
means
without
breaking
a
single
piece
of
wire
without
throwing
one
of
the
teeth
of
the
wheels
out
of
gear
to
lower
in
one
piece
by
a
marvellous
simplification
from
the

the

massive

accomplished
this
miracle
and
of

knows
not
even
the
name
nothing
that
could
be
compared
with
the
project
which
gilliatt
was
meditating
had
ever
been
attempted
the
ponderousness
the
delicacy
the
involvement
of
the
difficulties
were
not
less
in
the

of
the

in

from

able
at
time
of
need
to
assist
the
mason
of

and
to
encourage
him
with
their
friendly
voices
gilliatt
had
around
him
no
voices

those
of

no

the
assemblage
of

there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
than
the
timidity
of
ignorance
unless
it
be
its
temerity
when
ignorance
becomes
daring
she
has
sometimes
a
sort
of
compass
within
herself
the
intuition
of
the
truth
clearer
oftentimes
in
a
simple
mind
than
in
a
learned
brain
ignorance
invites
to
an
attempt
it
is
a
state
of
wonderment
which
with
its
concomitant
curiosity
forms
a
power
knowledge
often
enough
disconcerts
and
makes
gama

these
instances
i

are
exceptions

detract
nothing
from

remains

as
will
be
remembered
had
arranged
everything
for
maintaining
constant
communication
with
it
he
visited
the
sloop
and
measured
her
beam
carefully
in
several
parts
but
particularly
her
midship
frame
then
he
returned
to
the

and
measured
the

of

less

iii
gilliatt
masterpiece
comes
to
the
rescue
of
that
of
lethierry
any
fisherman
who
had
been
mad
enough
to
loiter
in
that
season
in
the
neighbourhood
of
gilliatt
labours
about
this
time
would
have
been
repaid
for
his
hardihood
by
a
singular
sight
between
the
two
douvres
before
his
eyes
would
have
appeared
four
stout
beams
at
equal
distances
stretching
from
one
douvre
to
the
other
and
apparently
forced
into
the
rock
which
is
the
firmest
of
all
holds
on
the
little
douvre
their
extremities
were
laid
and
buttressed
upon
the
projections
of
rock
on
the
great
douvre
they
had
been
driven
in
by
blows
of
a
hammer
by
the
powerful
hand
of
a
workman
standing
upright
upon
the
beam
itself
these
supports
were
a
little
longer
than
the
distance
between
the
rocks
hence
the
firmness
of
their
hold
and
hence
also
their
slanting
position
they
touched
the
great
douvre
at
an
acute
and
the
little
douvre
at
an
obtuse
angle
their
inclination
was
only
slight
but
it
was
unequal
which
was
a
defect
but
for
this
defect
they
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
prepared
to
receive
the
planking
of
a
deck
to
these
four
beams
were
attached
four
sets
of
hoisting
apparatus
each
having
its
pendent
and
its
with
the
bold
peculiarity
of
having
the
with
two
sheaves
at
one
extremity
of
the
beam
and
the
simple
pulleys
at
the
opposite
end
this
distance
which
was
too
great
not
to
be
perilous
was
necessitated
by
the
operations
to
be
effected
the
blocks
were
firm
and
the
pulleys
strong
to
this
cables
were
attached
which
from
a
distance
looked
like
threads
while
beneath
this
apparatus
of
tackle
and
carpentry
in
the
air
the
massive
hull
of
the
durande
seemed
suspended
by
threads
she
was
not
yet
suspended
however
under
the
cross
beams
eight
perpendicular
holes
had
been
made
in
the
deck
four
on
the
port
and
four
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
engine
eight
other
holes
had
been
made
beneath
them
through
the
keel
the
cables
descending
vertically
from
the
four
through
the
deck
passed
out
at
the
keel
and
under
the
machinery
the
ship
by
the
holes
on
the
other
side
and
passing
again
upward
through
the
deck
returned
and
were
wound
round
the
beams
here
a
sort
of
held
them
in
a
bunch
bound
fast
to
a
single
cable
capable
of
being
directed
by
one
arm
the
single
cable
passed
over
a
hook
and
through
a
which
completed
the
apparatus
and
kept
it
in
check
this
combination
compelled
the
four
tacklings
to
work
together
and
acting
as
a
complete
restraint
upon
the
suspending
powers
became
a
sort
of
dynamical
rudder
in
the
hand
of
the
pilot
of
the
operation
maintaining
the
movements
in
equilibrium
the
ingenious
adjustment
of
this
system
of
tackling
had
some
of
the
simplifying
qualities
of
the
weston
pulley
of
these
times
with
a
mixture
of
the
antique
polyspaston
of
vitruvius
gilliatt
had
discovered
this
although
he
knew
nothing
of
the
dead
vitruvius
or
of
the
still
unborn
weston
the
length
of
the
cables
varied
according
to
the
unequal
declivity
of
the
the
ropes
were
dangerous
for
the
untarred
hemp
was
liable
to
give
way
chains
would
have
been
better
in
this
respect
but
chains
would
not
have
passed
well
through
the
the
apparatus
was
full
of
defects
but
as
the
work
of
one
man
it
was
surprising
for
the
rest
it
will
be
understood
that
many
details
are
omitted
which
would
render
the
construction
perhaps
intelligible
to
practical
mechanics
but
obscure
to
others
the
top
of
the
funnel
passed
between
the
two
beams
in
the
middle
gilliatt
without
suspecting
it
had
reconstructed
three
centuries
later
the
mechanism
of
the
salbris
carpenter
a
mechanism
rude
and
incorrect
and
hazardous
for
him
who
would
dare
to
use
it
here
let
us
remark
that
the
rudest
defects
do
not
prevent
a
mechanism
from
working
well
or
ill
it
may
limp
but
it
moves
the
obelisk
in
the
square
of
peter
at
rome
is
erected
in
a
way
which
offends
against
all
the
principles
of
statics
the
carriage
of
the
czar
peter
was
so
constructed
that
it
appeared
about
to
overturn
at
every
step
but
it
travelled
onward
for
all
that
what
deformities
are
there
in
the
machinery
of
marly
everything
that
is
heterodox
in
hydraulics
yet
it
did
not
supply
louis
xiv
any
the
less
with
water
come
what
might
gilliatt
had
faith
he
had
even
anticipated
success
so
confidently
as
to
fix
in
the
bulwarks
of
the
sloop
on
the
day
when
he
measured
its
proportions
two
pairs
of
corresponding
iron
rings
on
each
side
exactly
at
the
same
distances
as
the
four
rings
on
board
the
durande
to
which
were
attached
the
four
chains
of
the
funnel
he
had
in
his
mind
a
very
complete
and
settled
plan
all
the
chances
being
against
him
he
had
evidently
determined
that
all
the
precautions
at
least
should
be
on
his
side
he
did
some
things
which
seemed
useless
a
sign
of
attentive
premeditation
his
manner
of
proceeding
would
as
we
have
said
have
puzzled
an
observer
even
though
familiar
with
mechanical
operations
a
witness
of
his
labour
who
had
seen
him
for
example
with
enormous
efforts
and
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
driving
with
blows
of
his
hammer
eight
or
ten
great
nails
which
he
had
forged
into
the
base
of
the
two
douvres
at
the
entrance
of
the
defile
between
them
would
have
had
some
difficulty
in
understanding
the
object
of
these
nails
and
would
probably
have
wondered
what
could
be
the
use
of
all
that
trouble
if
he
had
then
seen
him
measuring
the
portion
of
the
fore
bulwark
which
had
remained
as
we
have
described
it
hanging
on
by
the
wreck
then
attaching
a
strong
cable
to
the
upper
edge
of
that
portion
cutting
away
with
strokes
of
his
hatchet
the
dislocated
fastenings
which
held
it
then
dragging
it
out
of
the
defile
pushing
the
lower
part
by
the
aid
of
the
receding
tide
while
he
dragged
the
upper
part
finally
by
great
labour
fastening
with
the
cable
this
heavy
mass
of
planks
and
piles
wider
than
the
entrance
of
the
defile
itself
with
the
nails
driven
into
the
base
of
the
little
douvre
the
observer
would
perhaps
have
found
it
still
more
difficult
to
comprehend
and
might
have
wondered
why
gilliatt
if
he
wanted
for
the
purpose
of
his
operations
to
disencumber
the
space
between
the
two
rocks
of
this
mass
had
not
allowed
it
to
fall
into
the
sea
where
the
tide
would
have
carried
it
away
gilliatt
had
probably
his
reasons
in
fixing
the
nails
in
the
basement
of
the
rocks
he
had
taken
advantage
of
all
the
cracks
in
the
granite
enlarged
them
where
needful
and
driven
in
first
of
all
wedges
of
wood
in
which
he
fixed
the
nails
he
made
a
rough
commencement
of
similar
preparations
in
the
two
rocks
which
rose
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
narrow
passage
on
the
eastern
side
he
furnished
with
plugs
of
wood
all
the
crevices
as
if
he
desired
to
keep
these
also
ready
to
hold
nails
or
clamps
but
this
appeared
to
be
a
simple
precaution
for
he
did
not
use
them
further
he
was
compelled
to
economise
and
only
to
use
his
materials
as
he
had
need
and
at
the
moment
when
the
necessity
for
them
came
this
was
another
addition
to
his
numerous
difficulties
as
fast
as
one
labour
was
accomplished
another
became
necessary
gilliatt
passed
without
hesitation
from
task
to
task
and
resolutely
accomplished
his
giant
strides
iv
sub
re
the
aspect
of
the
man
who
accomplished
all
these
labours
became
terrible
gilliatt
in
his
multifarious
tasks
expended
all
his
strength
at
once
and
regained
it
with
difficulty
privations
on
the
one
hand
lassitude
on
the
other
had
much
reduced
him
his
hair
and
beard
had
grown
long
he
had
but
one
shirt
which
was
not
in
rags
he
went
about
the
wind
having
carried
away
one
of
his
shoes
and
the
sea
the
other
fractures
of
the
rude
and
dangerous
stone
anvil
which
he
used
had
left
small
wounds
upon
his
hands
and
arms
the
marks
of
labour
these
wounds
or
rather
scratches
were
superficial
but
the
keen
air
and
the
salt
sea
irritated
them
continually
he
was
generally
hungry
thirsty
and
cold
his
store
of
fresh
water
was
gone
his
was
used
or
eaten
he
had
nothing
left
but
a
little
biscuit
this
he
broke
with
his
teeth
having
no
water
in
which
to
steep
it
by
little
and
little
and
day
by
day
his
powers
decreased
the
terrible
rocks
were
consuming
his
existence
how
to
obtain
food
was
a
problem
how
to
get
drink
was
a
problem
how
to
find
rest
was
a
problem
he
ate
when
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
crayfish
or
a
crab
he
drank
when
he
chanced
to
see
a
descend
upon
a
point
of
rock
for
on
climbing
up
to
the
spot
he
generally
found
there
a
hollow
with
a
little
fresh
water
he
drank
from
it
after
the
bird
sometimes
with
the
bird
for
the
gulls
and
seamews
had
become
accustomed
to
him
and
no
longer
flew
away
at
his
approach
even
in
his
greatest
need
of
food
he
did
not
attempt
to
molest
them
he
had
as
will
be
remembered
a
superstition
about
birds
the
birds
on
their
part
now
that
his
hair
was
rough
and
wild
and
his
beard
long
had
no
fear
of
him
the
change
in
his
face
gave
them
confidence
he
had
lost
resemblance
to
men
and
taken
the
form
of
the
wild
beast
the
birds
and
gilliatt
in
fact
had
become
good
friends
companions
in
poverty
they
helped
each
other
as
long
as
he
had
had
any
meal
he
had
crumbled
for
them
some
little
bits
of
the
cakes
he
made
in
his
deeper
distress
they
showed
him
in
their
turn
the
places
where
he
might
find
the
little
pools
of
water
he
ate
the
raw
help
in
a
certain
degree
to
quench
the
thirst
the
crabs
he
cooked
having
no
kettle
he
roasted
them
between
two
stones
made
in
his
fire
after
the
manner
of
the
savages
of
the
feroe
islands
meanwhile
signs
of
the
equinoctial
season
had
begun
to
appear
there
came
rain
an
angry
rain
no
showers
or
steady
torrents
but
fine
sharp
icy
penetrating
points
which
pierced
to
his
skin
through
his
clothing
and
to
his
bones
through
his
skin
it
was
a
rain
which
yielded
little
water
for
drinking
but
which
drenched
him
none
the
less
chary
of
assistance
prodigal
of
misery
such
was
the
character
of
these
rains
during
one
week
gilliatt
suffered
from
them
all
day
and
all
night
at
night
in
his
rocky
recess
nothing
but
the
overpowering
fatigue
of
his
daily
work
enabled
him
to
get
sleep
the
great
stung
him
and
he
awakened
covered
with
blisters
he
had
a
kind
of
low
fever
which
sustained
him
this
fever
is
a
succour
which
destroys
by
instinct
he
chewed
the
mosses
or
sucked
the
leaves
of
wild
cochlearia
scanty
tufts
of
which
grew
in
the
dry
crevices
of
the
rocks
of
his
suffering
however
he
took
little
heed
he
had
no
time
to
spare
from
his
work
to
the
consideration
of
his
own
privations
the
rescue
of
the
machinery
of
the
durande
was
progressing
well
that
sufficed
for
him
every
now
and
then
for
the
necessities
of
his
work
he
jumped
into
the
water
swam
to
some
point
and
gained
a
footing
again
he
simply
plunged
into
the
sea
and
left
it
as
a
man
passes
from
one
room
in
his
dwelling
to
another
his
clothing
was
never
dry
it
was
saturated
with
rain
water
which
had
no
time
to
evaporate
and
with
sea
water
which
never
dries
he
lived
perpetually
wet
living
in
wet
clothing
is
a
habit
which
may
be
acquired
the
poor
groups
of
irish
people
old
men
mothers
girls
almost
naked
and
infants
who
pass
the
winter
in
the
open
air
under
the
snow
and
rain
huddled
together
sometimes
at
the
corners
of
houses
in
the
streets
of
london
live
and
die
in
this
condition
to
be
soaked
with
wet
and
yet
to
be
thirsty
gilliatt
grew
familiar
with
this
strange
torture
there
were
times
when
he
was
glad
to
suck
the
sleeve
of
his
loose
coat
the
fire
which
he
made
scarcely
warmed
him
a
fire
in
open
air
yields
little
comfort
it
burns
on
one
side
and
freezes
on
the
other
gilliatt
often
shivered
even
while
sweating
over
his
forge
everywhere
about
him
rose
resistance
amidst
a
terrible
silence
he
felt
himself
the
enemy
of
an
unseen
combination
there
is
a
dismal
in
nature
the
inertia
of
matter
is
like
a
sullen
threat
a
mysterious
persecution
environed
him
he
suffered
from
heats
and
shiverings
the
fire
ate
into
his
flesh
the
water
froze
him
feverish
thirst
tormented
him
the
wind
tore
his
clothing
hunger
undermined
the
organs
of
the
body
the
oppression
of
all
these
things
was
constantly
exhausting
him
obstacles
silent
immense
seemed
to
converge
from
all
points
with
the
blind
irresponsibility
of
fate
yet
full
of
a
savage
unanimity
he
felt
them
pressing
inexorably
upon
him
no
means
were
there
of
escaping
from
them
his
sufferings
produced
the
impression
of
some
living
persecutor
he
had
a
constant
sense
of
something
working
against
him
of
a
hostile
form
ever
present
ever
labouring
to
circumvent
and
to
subdue
him
he
could
have
fled
from
the
struggle
but
since
he
remained
he
had
no
choice
but
to
war
with
this
impenetrable
hostility
he
asked
himself
what
it
was
it
took
hold
of
him
grasped
him
tightly
overpowered
him
deprived
him
of
breath
the
invisible
persecutor
was
destroying
him
by
slow
degrees
every
day
the
oppression
became
greater
as
if
a
mysterious
screw
had
received
another
turn
his
situation
in
this
dreadful
spot
resembled
a
duel
in
which
a
suspicion
of
some
treachery
haunts
the
mind
of
one
of
the
combatants
now
it
seemed
a
coalition
of
obscure
forces
which
surrounded
him
he
felt
that
there
was
somewhere
a
determination
to
be
rid
of
his
presence
it
is
thus
that
the
glacier
chases
the
loitering
almost
without
seeming
to
touch
him
this
latent
coalition
had
reduced
him
to
rags
had
left
him
bleeding
distressed
and
as
it
were
de
even
before
the
battle
he
laboured
indeed
not
the
less
without
pause
or
rest
but
as
the
work
advanced
the
workman
himself
lost
ground
it
might
have
been
fancied
that
nature
dreading
his
bold
spirit
adopted
the
plan
of
slowly
undermining
his
bodily
power
gilliatt
kept
his
ground
and
left
the
rest
to
the
future
the
sea
had
begun
by
consuming
him
what
would
come
next
the
double
douvres
that
dragon
made
of
granite
and
lying
in
ambush
in
had
sheltered
him
it
had
allowed
him
to
enter
and
to
do
his
will
but
its
hospitality
resembled
the
welcome
of
devouring
jaws
the
desert
the
boundless
surface
the
unfathomable
space
around
him
and
above
so
full
of
negatives
to
man
will
the
mute
inexorable
determination
of
phenomena
following
their
appointed
course
the
grand
general
law
of
things
implacable
and
passive
the
ebbs
and
flows
the
rocks
themselves
dark
pleiades
whose
points
were
each
a
star
amid
vortices
a
centre
of
an
irradiation
of
currents
the
strange
indefinable
conspiracy
to
stifle
with
indifference
the
temerity
of
a
living
being
the
wintry
winds
the
clouds
and
the
beleaguering
waves
enveloped
him
closed
round
him
slowly
and
in
a
measure
shut
him
in
and
separated
him
from
companionship
like
a
dungeon
built
up
by
degrees
round
a
living
man
all
against
him
nothing
for
him
he
felt
himself
isolated
abandoned
enfeebled
sapped
forgotten
his
storehouse
empty
his
tools
broken
or
defective
he
was
tormented
with
hunger
and
thirst
by
day
with
cold
by
night
his
sufferings
had
left
him
with
wounds
and
tatters
rags
covering
sores
torn
hands
bleeding
feet
wasted
limbs
pallid
cheeks
and
eyes
bright
with
a
strange
light
but
this
was
the
steady
flame
of
his
determination
the
virtue
of
a
man
is
betrayed
by
his
eyes
how
much
of
the
man
there
is
in
us
may
be
read
in
their
depths
we
make
ourselves
known
by
the
light
that
gleams
beneath
our
brows
the
petty
natures
wink
at
us
the
larger
send
forth
flashes
if
there
is
no
brilliancy
under
the
lids
there
is
no
thought
in
the
brain
no
love
in
the
heart
those
who
love
desire
and
those
who
desire
sparkle
and
flash
determination
gives
a
fire
to
the
glance
a
magnificent
fire
that
consumes
all
timid
thoughts
it
is
the
ones
who
are
sublime
he
who
is
only
brave
has
but
a
passing
fit
he
who
is
only
valiant
has
temperament
and
nothing
more
he
who
is
courageous
has
but
one
virtue
he
who
persists
in
the
truth
is
the
grand
character
the
secret
of
great
hearts
may
be
summed
up
in
the
word
perseverando
perseverance
is
to
courage
what
the
wheel
is
to
the
lever
it
is
the
continual
renewing
of
the
centre
of
support
let
the
desired
goal
be
on
earth
or
in
heaven
only
make
for
the
goal
everything
is
in
that
in
the
first
case
one
is
a
columbus
in
the
second
a
god
not
to
allow
conscience
to
argue
or
the
will
to
fail
this
is
the
way
to
suffering
and
glory
in
the
world
of
ethics
to
fall
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
of
soaring
rather
does
it
give
impetus
to
flight
the
mediocrities
allow
themselves
to
be
dissuaded
by
the
specious
obstacles
the
great
ones
never
to
perish
is
their
perhaps
to
conquer
their
conviction
you
may
propose
many
good
reasons
to
the
martyr
why
he
should
not
allow
himself
to
be
stoned
to
death
disdain
of
every
reasonable
objection
begets
that
sublime
victory
of
the
vanquished
which
we
call
martyrdom
all
his
efforts
seemed
to
tend
to
the
impossible
his
success
was
trifling
and
slow
he
was
compelled
to
expend
much
labour
for
very
little
results
this
it
was
that
gave
to
his
struggle
its
noble
and
pathetic
character
that
it
should
have
required
so
many
preparations
so
much
toil
so
many
cautious
experiments
such
nights
of
hardship
and
such
days
of
danger
merely
to
set
up
four
beams
over
a
shipwrecked
vessel
to
divide
and
isolate
the
portion
that
could
be
saved
and
to
adjust
to
that
wreck
within
a
wreck
four
with
their
cables
was
only
the
result
of
his
solitary
labour
fate
had
decreed
him
the
work
and
necessity
obliged
him
to
carry
it
out
that
solitary
position
gilliatt
had
more
than
accepted
he
had
deliberately
chosen
it
dreading
a
competitor
because
a
competitor
might
have
proved
a
rival
he
had
sought
for
no
assistance
the
overwhelming
enterprise
the
risk
the
danger
the
toil
multiplied
by
itself
the
possible
destruction
of
the
salvor
in
his
work
famine
fever
nakedness
distress
he
had
chosen
all
these
for
himself
such
was
his
selfishness
he
was
like
a
man
placed
in
some
terrible
chamber
which
is
being
slowly
exhausted
of
air
his
vitality
was
leaving
him
by
little
and
little
he
scarcely
perceived
it
exhaustion
of
the
bodily
strength
does
not
necessarily
exhaust
the
will
faith
is
only
a
secondary
power
the
will
is
the
first
the
mountains
which
faith
is
proverbially
said
to
move
are
nothing
beside
that
which
the
will
can
accomplish
all
that
gilliatt
lost
in
vigour
he
gained
in
tenacity
the
destruction
of
the
physical
man
under
the
oppressive
influence
of
that
wild
surrounding
sea
and
rock
and
sky
seemed
only
to
reinvigorate
his
moral
nature
gilliatt
felt
no
fatigue
or
rather
would
not
yield
to
any
the
refusal
of
the
mind
to
recognise
the
failings
of
the
body
is
in
itself
an
immense
power
he
saw
nothing
except
the
steps
in
the
progress
of
his
labours
his
object
now
seeming
so
near
attainment
wrapped
him
in
perpetual
illusions
he
endured
all
this
suffering
without
any
other
thought
than
is
comprised
in
the
word
forward
his
work
flew
to
his
head
the
strength
of
the
will
is
intoxicating
its
intoxication
is
called
heroism
he
had
become
a
kind
of
job
having
the
ocean
for
the
scene
of
his
sufferings
but
he
was
a
job
wrestling
with
difficulty
a
job
combating
and
making
head
against
afflictions
a
job
conquering
a
combination
of
job
and
prometheus
if
such
names
are
not
too
great
to
be
applied
to
a
poor
sailor
and
fisher
of
crabs
and
crayfish
v
sub
umbra
sometimes
in
the
gilliatt
woke
and
peered
into
the
darkness
he
felt
a
strange
emotion
his
eyes
were
opened
upon
the
black
night
the
situation
was
dismal
full
of
disquietude
there
is
such
a
thing
as
the
pressure
of
darkness
a
strange
roof
of
shadow
a
deep
obscurity
which
no
diver
can
explore
a
light
mingled
with
that
obscurity
of
a
strange
subdued
and
sombre
kind
floating
atoms
of
rays
like
a
dust
of
seeds
or
of
ashes
millions
of
lamps
but
no
illumining
a
vast
sprinkling
of
fire
of
which
no
man
knows
the
secret
a
diffusion
of
shining
points
like
a
drift
of
sparks
arrested
in
their
course
the
disorder
of
the
whirlwind
with
the
fixedness
of
death
a
mysterious
and
abyssmal
depth
an
enigma
at
once
showing
and
concealing
its
face
the
infinite
in
its
mask
of
darkness
these
are
the
synonyms
of
night
its
weight
lies
heavily
on
the
soul
of
man
this
union
of
all
mysteries
the
mystery
of
the
cosmos
and
the
mystery
of
fate
oppresses
human
reason
the
pressure
of
darkness
acts
in
inverse
proportion
upon
different
kinds
of
natures
in
the
presence
of
night
man
feels
his
own
incompleteness
he
perceives
the
dark
void
and
is
sensible
of
infirmity
it
is
like
the
vacancy
of
blindness
face
to
face
with
night
man
bends
kneels
prostrates
himself
crouches
on
the
earth
crawls
towards
a
cave
or
seeks
for
wings
almost
always
he
shrinks
from
that
vague
presence
of
the
infinite
unknown
he
asks
himself
what
it
is
he
trembles
and
bows
the
head
sometimes
he
desires
to
go
to
it
to
go
whither
he
can
only
answer
yonder
but
what
is
that
and
what
is
there
this
curiosity
is
evidently
forbidden
to
the
spirit
of
man
for
all
around
him
the
roads
which
bridge
that
gulf
are
broken
up
or
gone
no
arch
exists
for
him
to
span
the
infinite
but
there
is
attraction
in
forbidden
knowledge
as
in
the
edge
of
the
abyss
where
the
footstep
can
not
tread
the
eye
may
reach
where
the
eye
can
penetrate
no
further
the
mind
may
soar
there
is
no
man
however
feeble
or
insufficient
his
resources
who
does
not
essay
according
to
his
nature
he
questions
or
recoils
before
that
mystery
with
some
it
has
the
effect
of
repressing
with
others
it
enlarges
the
soul
the
spectacle
is
sombre
indefinite
is
the
night
calm
and
cloudless
it
is
then
a
depth
of
shadow
is
it
stormy
it
is
then
a
sea
of
cloud
its
limitless
deeps
reveal
themselves
to
us
and
yet
baffle
our
gaze
close
themselves
against
research
but
open
to
conjecture
its
innumerable
dots
of
light
only
make
deeper
the
obscurity
beyond
jewels
scintillations
stars
existences
revealed
in
the
unknown
universes
dread
defiances
to
man
approach
landmarks
of
the
infinite
creation
boundaries
there
where
there
are
no
bounds
impossible
and
yet
real
numbering
the
fathoms
of
those
infinite
deeps
one
microscopic
glittering
point
then
another
then
another
imperceptible
yet
enormous
yonder
light
is
a
focus
that
focus
is
a
star
that
star
is
a
sun
that
sun
is
a
universe
that
universe
is
nothing
for
all
numbers
are
as
zero
in
the
presence
of
the
infinite
these
worlds
which
yet
are
nothing
exist
through
this
fact
we
feel
the
difference
which
separates
the
from
the
to
the
inaccessible
joined
to
the
inexplicable
such
is
the
universe
from
the
contemplation
of
the
universe
is
evolved
a
sublime
phenomenon
the
soul
growing
vast
through
its
sense
of
wonder
a
reverent
fear
is
peculiar
to
man
the
beasts
know
no
such
fear
his
intelligence
becomes
conscious
in
this
august
terror
of
its
own
power
and
its
own
weakness
darkness
has
unity
hence
arises
horror
at
the
same
time
it
is
complex
and
hence
terror
its
unity
weighs
on
the
spirit
and
destroys
all
desire
of
resistance
its
complexity
causes
us
to
look
around
on
all
sides
apparently
we
have
reason
to
fear
sudden
happenings
we
yield
and
yet
are
on
guard
we
are
in
presence
of
the
whole
hence
submission
and
of
the
many
hence
defiance
the
unity
of
darkness
contains
a
multiple
a
mysterious
plurality
visible
in
matter
realised
in
thought
silence
rules
all
another
reason
for
watchfulness
night
and
he
who
writes
this
has
said
it
elsewhere
is
the
right
and
normal
condition
of
that
special
part
of
creation
to
which
we
belong
light
brief
of
duration
here
as
throughout
space
is
but
the
nearness
of
a
star
this
universal
prodigious
night
does
not
fulfil
itself
without
friction
and
all
such
friction
in
such
a
mechanism
means
what
we
call
evil
we
feel
this
darkness
to
be
evil
a
latent
denial
of
divine
order
the
implicit
blasphemy
of
the
real
rebelling
against
the
ideal
evil
complicates
by
one
knows
not
what
monstrosity
the
vast
cosmic
whole
everywhere
it
arises
and
resists
it
is
the
tempest
and
hinders
the
hastening
ship
it
is
chaos
and
trammels
the
birth
of
a
world
good
is
one
evil
is
ubiquitous
evil
dislocates
the
logic
of
life
it
causes
the
bird
to
devour
the
fly
and
the
comet
to
destroy
the
planet
evil
is
a
blot
on
the
page
of
creation
the
darkness
of
night
is
full
of
vertiginous
uncertainty
whoso
would
sound
its
depths
is
submerged
and
struggles
therein
what
fatigue
to
be
compared
to
this
contemplation
of
shadows
it
is
the
study
of
annihilation
there
is
no
sure
hold
on
which
the
soul
may
rest
there
are
ports
of
departure
and
no
havens
for
arrival
the
interlacing
of
contradictory
solutions
all
the
branches
of
doubt
seen
at
a
glance
the
ramifications
of
phenomena
budding
limitlessly
from
some
undefined
impulse
laws
intersecting
each
other
an
incomprehensible
promiscuity
causing
the
mineral
to
become
vegetable
the
vegetable
to
rise
to
higher
life
thought
to
gather
weight
love
to
shine
and
gravitation
to
attract
the
immense
range
presented
to
view
by
all
questions
extending
itself
into
the
limitless
obscurity
the
half
seen
suggesting
the
unknown
the
cosmic
correlation
appearing
clearly
not
to
sight
but
to
intelligence
in
the
vast
dim
space
the
invisible
become
visible
these
are
the
great
overshadowing
man
lives
beneath
it
he
is
ignorant
of
detail
but
he
carries
in
such
proportion
as
he
is
able
to
bear
the
weight

are

by

there

thirteen

of

every
enigma
is
propounded
in
one
the
irreducible
is
before
us
hence
we
are
constrained
to
some
kind
of
faith
an
involuntary
belief
is
the
result
but
belief
does
not
ensure
peace
of

faith
has
an
extraordinary
desire
to

hence
religions
nothing
is
so
overwhelming
as
a
formless
faith
and
despite
of
thought
or
desire
or
inward
resistance
to
look
at
the
darkness
is
to
fall
into
profound
and
wondering
meditation
what
can
we
make
of
these
phenomena
how
should
we
act
beneath
their
united
forces
to

such
weight
of

is

what

all
these
mystic
vistas
what
abstruse
revelations
arise
stammering
and
are
obscure
from
their
very
mass
as
a
hesitating
speech
darkness
is
silence
but
such
a
silence
suggests
everything
one
majestic
thought
is
the
result
god
god
is
the
irrepressible
idea
that
springs
within
man
soul
syllogisms
feuds
negations
systems
religions
can
not
destroy
it
this
idea
is
affirmed
by
the
whole
dark
universe
yet
unrest
is
everywhere
in
fearful
immanence
the
wondrous
correlation
of
forces
is
manifested
in
the
upholding
of
the
balanced
darkness
the
universe
is
suspended
and
nothing
falls
incessant
and
immeasurable
changes
operate
without
accident
or
destruction
man
participates
in
the
constant
changes
and
in
experiencing
such
he
names
them
destiny
but
where
does
destiny
begin
and
where
does
nature
end
what
difference
is
there
between
an
event
and
a
season
between
a
sorrow
and
a
rainfall
between
a
virtue
and
a
star
an
hour
is
it
not
a
rolling
wave
the
wheels
of
creation
revolve
mechanically
regardless
of
man
the
starry
sky
is
a
vision
of
wheels
pendulums
and
counterpoise
he
who
contemplates
it
can
not
but
ponder
upon
it
it
is
the
whole
reality
and
yet
the
whole
abstraction
and
nothing
more
we
are
in
prison
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
darkness
and
no
evasion
is
possible
we
are
an
integral
part
of
the
working
of
this
unknown
whole
and
we
feel
the
mystery
within
us
fraternising
with
the
mystery
beyond
us
hence
the
sublimity
of
death
what
anguish
and
yet
what
bliss
to
belong
to
the
infinite
and
through
the
sense
of
the
infinite
to
recognise
our
inevitable
immortality
the
possibility
of
an
eternity
to
grasp
amid
this
prodigious
deluge
of
universal
life
the
persistent
imperishable
to
look
at
the
stars
and
say
the
living
soul
within
me
is
akin
to
you
to
gaze
into
darkness
and
cry
i
am
as
unfathomable
as
thou
such
immensity
is
of
night
and
added
to
solitude
weighed
heavily
on
gilliatt
mind
did
he
understand
it
no
did
he
feel
it
yes
all
these
vague
imaginings
increased
and
intensified
by
solitude
weighed
upon
gilliatt

understood
them
little
but
he
felt
them
his
was

powerful

and
untaught
vi
gilliatt
places
the
sloop
in
readiness
this
rescue
of
the
machinery
of
the
wreck
as
meditated
by
gilliatt
was
as
we
have
already
said
like
the
escape
of
a
criminal
from
a
prison
necessitating
all
the
patience
and
industry
recorded
of
such
achievements
industry
carried
to
the
point
of
a
miracle
patience
only
to
be
compared
with
a
long
agony
a
certain
prisoner
named
thomas
at
the
mont
saint
michel
found
means
of
secreting
the
greater
part
of
a
wall
in
his
paillasse
another
at
tulle
in
cut
away
a
quantity
of
lead
from
the
terrace
where
the
prisoners
walked
for
exercise
with
what
kind
of
knife
no
one
would
guess
and
melted
this
lead
with
what
fire
none
have
ever
discovered
but
it
is
known
that
he
cast
it
in
a
mould
made
of
the
crumbs
of
bread
with
this
lead
and
this
mould
he
made
a
key
and
with
this
key
succeeded
in
opening
a
lock
of
which
he
had
never
seen
anything
but
the
keyhole
some
of
this
marvellous
ingenuity
gilliatt
possessed
he
had
once
climbed
and
descended
from
the
cliff
at
boisrosé
he
was
the
baron
trenck
of
the
wreck
and
the
latude
of
her
machinery
the
sea
like
a
jailor
kept
watch
over
him
for
the
rest
mischievous
and
inclement
as
the
rain
had
been
he
had
contrived
to
derive
some
benefit
from
it
he
had
in
part
replenished
his
stock
of
fresh
water
but
his
thirst
was
inextinguishable
and
he
emptied
his
can
as
fast
as
he
filled
it
one
day
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
april
or
the
first
of
may
all
was
at
length
ready
for
his
purpose
the
was
as
it
were
enclosed
between
the
eight
cables
hanging
from
the
four
on
one
side
four
on
the
other
the
sixteen
holes
upon
the
deck
and
under
the
keel
through
which
the
cables
passed
had
been
hooped
round
by
sawing
the
planking
had
been
sawed
the
timber
cut
with
the
hatchet
the
ironwork
with
a
file
the
sheathing
with
the
chisel
the
part
of
the
keel
immediately
under
the
machinery
was
cut
squarewise
and
ready
to
descend
with
it
while
still
supporting
it
all
this
frightful
swinging
mass
was
held
only
by
one
chain
which
was
itself
only
kept
in
position
by
a
filed
notch
at
this
stage
in
such
a
labour
and
so
near
its
completion
haste
is
prudence
the
water
was
low
the
moment
favourable
gilliatt
had
succeeded
in
removing
the
axle
of
the
paddles
the
extremities
of
which
might
have
proved
an
obstacle
and
checked
the
descent
he
had
contrived
to
make
this
heavy
portion
fast
in
a
vertical
position
within
the
itself
it
was
time
to
bring
his
work
to
an
end
the
workman
as
we
have
said
was
not
weary
for
his
will
was
strong
but
his
tools
were
the
forge
was
by
degrees
becoming
impracticable
the
blower
had
begun
to
work
badly
the
little
hydraulic
fall
being
of
saline
deposits
had
encrusted
the
joints
of
the
apparatus
and
prevented
its
free
action
gilliatt
visited
the
creek
of
the
man
rock
examined
the
sloop
and
assured
himself
that
all
was
in
good
condition
particularly
the
four
rings
fixed
to
starboard
and
to
larboard
then
he
weighed
anchor
and
worked
the
heavy
craft
with
the
oars
till
he
brought
it
alongside
the
two
douvres
the
defile
between
the
rocks
was
wide
enough
to
admit
it
there
was
also
depth
enough
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
possible
to
push
the
sloop
under
the
durande
the
feat
however
was
difficult
it
required
the
minute
precision
of
a
watchmaker
the
operation
was
all
the
more
delicate
from
the
fact
that
for
his
objects
he
was
compelled
to
force
it
in
by
the
stern
rudder
first
it
was
necessary
that
the
mast
and
the
ringing
of
the
sloop
should
project
beyond
the
wreck
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
these
embarrassments
rendered
all
gilliatt
operations
awkward
it
was
not
like
entering
the
creek
of
the
man
where
it
was
a
mere
affair
of
the
tiller
it
was
necessary
here
to
push
drag
row
and
take
soundings
all
together
gilliatt
consumed
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
these
manoeuvres
but
he
was
successful
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
sloop
was
adjusted
under
the
wreck
it
was
almost
wedged
in
there
by
means
of
his
two
anchors
he
moored
the
boat
by
head
and
stern
the
strongest
of
the
two
was
placed
so
as
to
be
efficient
against
the
strongest
wind
that
blows
which
was
that
from
the
then
by
the
aid
of
a
lever
and
the
capstan
he
lowered
into
the
sloop
the
two
cases
containing
the
pieces
of
the
the
slings
of
which
were
all
ready
the
two
cases
served
as
ballast
relieved
of
these
encumbrances
he
fastened
to
the
hook
of
the
chain
of
the
capstan
the
sling
of
the
regulating
intending
to
check
the
pulleys
owing
to
the
peculiar
objects
of
this
labour
the
defects
of
the
old
sloop
became
useful
qualities
it
had
no
deck
her
burden
therefore
would
have
greater
depth
and
could
rest
upon
the
hold
her
mast
was
very
forward
too
far
forward
indeed
for
general
purposes
her
contents
therefore
would
have
more
room
and
the
mast
standing
thus
beyond
the
mass
of
the
wreck
there
would
be
nothing
to
hinder
its
disembarkation
it
was
a
mere
shell
or
case
for
receiving
it
but
nothing
is
more
stable
than
this
on
the
sea
while
engaged
in
these
operations
gilliatt
suddenly
perceived
that
the
sea
was
rising
he
looked
around
to
see
from
what
quarter
the
wind
was
coming
vii
sudden
danger
the
breeze
was
scarcely
perceptible
but
what
there
was
came
from
the
west
a
disagreeable
habit
of
the
winds
during
the
equinoxes
the
rising
sea
varies
much
in
its
effects
upon
the
douvres
rocks
depending
upon
the
quarter
of
the
wind
according
to
the
gale
which
drives
them
before
it
the
waves
enter
the
rocky
corridor
either
from
the
east
or
from
the
west
entering
from
the
east
the
sea
is
comparatively
gentle
coming
from
the
west
it
is
always
furious
the
reason
of
this
is
that
the
wind
from
the
east
blowing
from
the
land
has
not
had
time
to
gather
force
while
the
westerly
winds
coming
from
the
atlantic
blow
unchecked
from
a
vast
ocean
even
a
very
slight
breeze
if
it
comes
from
the
west
is
serious
it
rolls
the
huge
billows
from
the
illimitable
space
and
dashes
the
waves
against
the
narrow
defile
in
greater
bulk
than
can
find
entrance
there
a
sea
which
rolls
into
a
gulf
is
always
terrible
it
is
the
same
with
a
crowd
of
people
a
multitude
is
a
sort
of
fluid
body
when
the
quantity
which
can
enter
is
less
than
the
quantity
endeavouring
to
force
a
way
there
is
a
fatal
crush
among
the
crowd
a
fierce
convulsion
on
the
water
as
long
as
the
west
wind
blows
however
slight
the
breeze
the
douvres
are
twice
a
day
subjected
to
that
rude
assault
the
sea
rises
the
tide
breasts
up
the
narrow
gullet
gives
little
entrance
the
waves
driven
against
it
violently
rebound
and
roar
and
a
tremendous
surf
beats
the
two
sides
of
the
gorge
thus
the
douvres
during
the
slightest
wind
from
the
west
present
the
singular
spectacle
of
a
sea
comparatively
calm
without
while
within
the
rocks
a
storm
is
raging
this
tumult
of
waters
altogether
confined
and
circumscribed
has
nothing
of
the
character
of
a
tempest
it
is
a
mere
local
outbreak
among
the
waves
but
a
terrible
one
as
regards
the
winds
from
the
north
and
south
they
strike
the
rocks
crosswise
and
cause
little
surf
in
the
passage
the
entrance
by
the
east
a
fact
which
must
be
borne
in
mind
was
close
to
the
man
rock
the
dangerous
opening
to
the
west
was
at
the
opposite
extremity
exactly
between
the
two
douvres
it
was
at
this
western
entrance
that
gilliatt
found
himself
with
the
wrecked
durande
and
the
sloop
made
fast
beneath
it
a
catastrophe
seemed
inevitable
there
was
not
much
wind
but
it
was
sufficient
for
the
impending
mischief
before
many
hours
the
swell
which
was
rising
would
be
rushing
with
full
force
into
the
gorge
of
the
douvres
the
first
waves
were
already
breaking
this
swell
and
eddy
of
the
entire
atlantic
would
have
behind
it
the
immense
sea
there
would
be
no
squall
no
violence
but
a
simple
overwhelming
wave
which
commencing
on
the
coasts
of
america
rolls
towards
the
shores
of
europe
with
an
impetus
gathered
over
two
thousand
leagues
this
wave
a
gigantic
ocean
barrier
meeting
the
gap
of
the
rocks
must
be
caught
between
the
two
douvres
standing
like
at
the
entrance
or
like
pillars
of
the
defile
thus
swelled
by
the
tide
augmented
by
resistance
driven
back
by
the
shoals
and
urged
on
by
the
wind
it
would
strike
the
rock
with
violence
and
with
all
the
contortions
from
the
obstacles
it
had
encountered
and
all
the
frenzy
of
a
sea
confined
in
limits
would
rush
between
the
rocky
walls
where
it
would
reach
the
sloop
and
the
durande
and
in
all
probability
destroy
them
a
shield
against
this
danger
was
wanting
gilliatt
had
one
the
problem
was
to
prevent
the
sea
reaching
it
at
one
bound
to
obstruct
it
from
striking
while
allowing
it
to
rise
to
bar
the
passage
without
refusing
it
admission
to
prevent
the
compression
of
the
water
in
the
gorge
which
was
the
whole
danger
to
turn
an
eruption
into
a
simple
flood
to
extract
as
it
were
from
the
waves
all
their
violence
and
constrain
the
furies
to
be
gentle
it
was
in
fact
to
substitute
an
obstacle
which
will
appease
for
an
obstacle
which
irritates
gilliatt
with
all
that
dexterity
which
he
possessed
and
which
is
so
much
more
efficient
than
mere
force
sprang
upon
the
rocks
like
a
chamois
among
the
mountains
or
a
monkey
in
the
forest
using
for
his
tottering
and
dizzy
strides
the
smallest
projecting
stone
leaping
into
the
water
and
issuing
from
it
again
swimming
among
the
shoals
and
clambering
the
rocks
with
a
rope
between
his
teeth
and
a
mallet
in
his
hand
thus
he
detached
the
cable
which
kept
suspended
and
also
fast
to
the
basement
of
the
little
douvre
the
end
of
the
forward
side
of
the
durande
fashioned
out
of
some
ends
of
hawsers
a
sort
of
hinges
holding
this
bulwark
to
the
huge
nails
fixed
in
the
granite
swung
this
apparatus
of
planks
upon
them
like
the
gates
of
a
great
dock
and
turned
their
sides
as
he
would
turn
a
rudder
outward
to
the
waves
which
pushed
the
extremities
upon
the
great
douvre
while
the
rope
hinges
detained
the
other
extremities
upon
the
little
douvre
next
he
contrived
by
means
of
the
huge
nails
placed
beforehand
for
the
purpose
to
fix
the
same
kind
of
fastenings
upon
the
great
douvre
as
on
the
little
one
made
completely
fast
the
vast
mass
of
woodwork
against
the
two
pillars
of
the
gorge
slung
a
chain
across
this
barrier
like
a
baldric
upon
a
cuirass
and
in
less
than
an
hour
this
barricade
against
the
sea
was
complete
and
the
gullet
of
the
rocks
closed
as
by
a
this
powerful
apparatus
a
heavy
mass
of
beams
and
planks
which
laid
flat
would
have
made
a
raft
and
upright
formed
a
wall
had
by
the
aid
of
the
water
been
handled
by
gilliatt
with
the
adroitness
of
a
juggler
it
might
almost
have
been
said
that
the
obstruction
was
complete
before
the
rising
sea
had
the
time
to
perceive
it
it
was
one
of
those
occasions
on
which
jean
bart
would
have
employed
the
famous
expression
which
he
applied
to
the
sea
every
time
he
narrowly
escaped
shipwreck
we
have
cheated
the
englishman
for
it
is
well
known
that
when
that
famous
admiral
meant
to
speak
contemptuously
of
the
ocean
he
called
it
the
englishman
the
entrance
to
the
defile
being
thus
protected
gilliatt
thought
of
the
sloop
he
loosened
sufficient
cable
for
the
two
anchors
to
allow
her
to
rise
with
the
tide
an
operation
similar
to
what
the
mariners
of
old
called
avec
des
in
all
this
gilliatt
was
not
taken
the
least
by
surprise
the
necessity
had
been
foreseen
a
seaman
would
have
perceived
it
by
the
two
pulleys
of
the
top
ropes
cut
in
the
form
of
and
fixed
behind
the
sloop
through
which
passed
two
ropes
the
ends
of
which
were
slung
through
the
rings
of
the
anchors
meanwhile
the
tide
was
rising
fast
the
half
flood
had
arrived
a
moment
when
the
shock
of
the
waves
even
in
comparatively
moderate
weather
may
become
considerable
exactly
what
gilliatt
expected
came
to
pass
the
waves
rolled
violently
against
the
barrier
struck
it
broke
heavily
and
passed
beneath
outside
was
the
heavy
swell
within
the
waters
ran
quietly
he
had
devised
a
sort
of
marine
the
sea
was
conquered
viii
movement
rather
than
progress
the
moment
so
long
dreaded
had
come
the
problem
now
was
to
place
the
machinery
in
the
bark
gilliatt
remained
thoughtful
for
some
moments
holding
the
elbow
of
his
left
arm
in
his
right
hand
and
applying
his
left
hand
to
his
forehead
then
he
climbed
upon
the
wreck
one
part
of
which
containing
the
engine
was
to
be
parted
from
it
while
the
other
remained
he
severed
the
four
slings
which
fixed
the
four
chains
from
the
funnel
on
the
larboard
and
the
starboard
sides
the
slings
being
only
of
cord
his
knife
served
him
well
enough
for
this
purpose
the
four
chains
set
free
hung
down
along
the
sides
of
the
funnel
from
the
wreck
he
climbed
up
to
the
apparatus
which
he
had
constructed
stamped
with
his
feet
upon
the
beams
inspected
the
looked
to
the
pulleys
handled
the
cables
examined
the
assured
himself
that
the
untarred
hemp
was
not
saturated
through
found
that
nothing
was
wanting
and
nothing
giving
way
then
springing
from
the
height
of
the
suspending
props
on
to
the
deck
he
took
up
his
position
near
the
capstan
in
the
part
of
the
durande
which
he
intended
to
leave
jammed
in
between
the
two
douvres
this
was
to
be
his
post
during
his
labours
earnest
but
troubled
with
no
impulses
but
what
were
useful
to
his
work
he
took
a
final
glance
at
the
then
seized
a
file
and
began
to
saw
with
it
through
the
chain
which
held
the
whole
suspended
the
rasping
of
the
file
was
audible
amidst
the
roaring
of
the
sea
the
chain
from
the
capstan
attached
to
the
regulating
gear
was
within
his
reach
quite
near
his
hand
suddenly
there
was
a
crash
the
link
which
he
was
filing
snapped
when
only
half
cut
through
the
whole
apparatus
swung
violently
he
had
only
just
time
sufficient
to
seize
the
regulating
gear
the
severed
chain
beat
against
the
rock
the
eight
cables
strained
the
huge
mass
sawed
and
cut
through
detached
itself
from
the
wreck
the
belly
of
the
hull
opened
and
the
iron
flooring
of
the
was
visible
below
the
keel
if
he
had
not
seized
the
regulating
tackle
at
that
instant
it
would
have
fallen
but
his
powerful
hand
was
there
and
it
descended
steadily
when
the
brother
of
jean
bart
peter
bart
that
powerful
and
sagacious
toper
that
poor
dunkirk
fisherman
who
used
to
talk
familiarly
with
the
grand
admiral
of
france
went
to
the
rescue
of
the
galley
in
distress
in
the
bay
of
ambleteuse
endeavouring
to
save
the
heavy
floating
mass
in
the
midst
of
the
breakers
of
that
furious
bay
he
rolled
up
the
mainsail
tied
it
with
and
trusted
to
the
ties
to
break
away
of
themselves
and
give
the
sail
to
the
wind
at
the
right
moment
just
so
gilliatt
trusted
to
the
breaking
of
the
chain
and
the
same
eccentric
feat
of
daring
was
crowned
with
the
same
success
the
tackle
taken
in
hand
by
gilliatt
held
out
and
worked
well
its
function
as
will
be
remembered
was
to
moderate
the
powers
of
the
apparatus
thus
reduced
from
many
to
one
by
bringing
them
into
united
action
the
gear
had
some
similarity
to
a
bridle
of
a
bowline
except
that
instead
of
trimming
a
sail
it
served
to
balance
a
complicated
mechanism
erect
and
with
his
hand
upon
the
capstan
gilliatt
so
to
speak
was
enabled
to
feel
the
pulse
of
the
apparatus
it
was
here
that
his
inventive
genius
manifested
itself
a
remarkable
coincidence
of
forces
was
the
result
while
the
machinery
of
the
durande
detached
in
a
mass
was
lowering
to
the
sloop
the
sloop
rose
slowly
to
receive
it
the
wreck
and
the
salvage
vessel
assisting
each
other
in
opposite
ways
saved
half
the
labour
of
the
operation
the
tide
swelling
quietly
between
the
two
douvres
raised
the
sloop
and
brought
it
nearer
to
the
durande
the
sea
was
more
than
conquered
it
was
tamed
and
broken
in
it
became
in
fact
part
and
parcel
of
the
organisation
of
power
the
rising
waters
lifted
the
vessel
without
any
sort
of
shock
gently
and
almost
with
precaution
as
one
would
handle
porcelain
gilliatt
combined
and
proportioned
the
two
labours
that
of
the
water
and
that
of
the
apparatus
and
standing
steadfast
at
the
capstan
like
some
terrible
statue
obeyed
by
all
the
movement
around
it
at
the
same
moment
regulated
the
slowness
of
the
descent
by
the
slow
rise
of
the
sea
there
was
no
jerk
given
by
the
waters
no
slip
among
the
tackle
it
was
a
strange
collaboration
of
all
the
natural
forces
subdued
on
one
side
gravitation
lowering
the
huge
bulk
on
the
other
the
sea
raising
the
bark
the
attraction
of
heavenly
bodies
which
causes
the
tide
and
the
attractive
force
of
the
earth
which
men
call
weight
seemed
to
conspire
together
to
aid
his
plans
there
was
no
hesitation
no
stoppage
in
their
service
under
the
dominance
of
mind
these
passive
forces
became
active
auxiliaries
from
minute
to
minute
the
work
advanced
the
interval
between
the
wreck
and
the
sloop
diminished
insensibly
the
approach
continued
in
silence
and
as
in
a
sort
of
terror
of
the
man
who
stood
there
the
elements
received
his
orders
and
fulfilled
them
nearly
at
the
moment
when
the
tide
ceased
to
raise
it
the
cable
ceased
to
slide
suddenly
but
without
commotion
the
pulleys
stopped
the
vast
machine
had
taken
its
place
in
the
bark
as
if
placed
there
by
a
powerful
hand
it
stood
straight
upright
motionless
firm
the
iron
floor
of
the
rested
with
its
four
corners
evenly
upon
the
hold
the
work
was
accomplished
gilliatt
contemplated
it
lost
in
thought
he
was
not
the
spoiled
child
of
success
he
bent
under
the
weight
of
his
great
joy
he
felt
his
limbs
as
it
were
sinking
and
contemplating
his
triumph
he
who
had
never
been
shaken
by
danger
began
to
tremble
he
gazed
upon
the
sloop
under
the
wreck
and
at
the
machinery
in
the
sloop
he
seemed
to
feel
it
hard
to
believe
it
true
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
he
had
never
looked
forward
to
that
which
he
had
accomplished
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
by
his
hands
and
he
contemplated
it
in
bewilderment
his
reverie
lasted
but
a
short
time
starting
like
one
awakening
from
a
deep
sleep
he
seized
his
saw
cut
the
eight
cables
separated
now
from
the
sloop
thanks
to
the
rising
of
the
tide
by
only
about
ten
feet
sprang
aboard
took
a
bunch
of
cord
made
four
slings
passed
them
through
the
rings
prepared
beforehand
and
fixed
on
both
sides
aboard
the
sloop
the
four
chains
of
the
funnel
which
only
an
hour
before
had
been
still
fastened
to
their
places
aboard
the
durande
the
funnel
being
secured
he
disengaged
the
upper
part
of
the
machinery
a
square
portion
of
the
planking
of
the
durande
was
adhering
to
it
he
struck
off
the
nails
and
relieved
the
sloop
of
this
encumbrance
of
planks
and
beams
which
fell
over
on
to
the
rocks
a
great
assistance
in
lightening
it
for
the
rest
the
sloop
as
has
been
foreseen
behaved
well
under
the
burden
of
the
machinery
it
had
sunk
in
the
water
but
only
to
a
good
although
massive
the
engine
of
the
durande
was
less
heavy
than
the
pile
of
stones
and
the
cannon
which
he
had
once
brought
back
from
herm
in
the
sloop
all
then
was
ended
he
had
only
to
depart
ix
a
slip
between
cup
and
lip
all
was
not
ended
to
the
gorge
thus
closed
by
the
portion
of
the
bulwarks
and
at
once
to
push
out
with
the
sloop
beyond
the
rocks
nothing
could
appear
more
clear
and
simple
on
the
ocean
every
minute
is
urgent
there
was
little
wind
scarcely
a
wrinkle
on
the
open
sea
the
afternoon
was
beautiful
and
promised
a
fine
night
the
sea
indeed
was
calm
but
the
ebb
had
begun
the
moment
was
favourable
for
starting
there
would
be
the
for
leaving
the
douvres
and
the
flood
would
carry
him
into
guernsey
it
would
be
possible
to
be
at
sampson
at
daybreak
but
an
unexpected
obstacle
presented
itself
there
was
a
flaw
in
his
arrangements
which
had
baffled
all
his
foresight
the
machinery
was
freed
but
the
chimney
was
not
the
tide
by
raising
the
sloop
to
the
wreck
suspended
in
the
air
had
diminished
the
dangers
of
the
descent
and
abridged
the
labour
but
this
diminution
of
the
interval
had
left
the
top
of
the
funnel
entangled
in
the
kind
of
gaping
frame
formed
by
the
open
hull
of
the
durande
the
funnel
was
held
fast
there
as
between
four
walls
the
services
rendered
by
the
sea
had
been
accompanied
by
that
unfortunate
drawback
it
seemed
as
if
the
waves
constrained
to
obey
had
avenged
themselves
by
a
malicious
trick
it
is
true
that
what
the
had
done
the
ebb
would
undo
the
funnel
which
was
rather
more
than
three
fathoms
in
height
was
buried
more
than
eight
feet
in
the
wreck
the
would
fall
about
twelve
feet
thus
the
funnel
descending
with
the
falling
tide
would
have
four
feet
of
room
to
spare
and
would
clear
itself
easily
but
how
much
time
would
elapse
before
that
release
would
be
completed
six
hours
in
six
hours
it
would
be
near
midnight
what
means
would
there
be
of
attempting
to
start
at
such
an
hour
what
channel
could
he
find
among
all
those
breakers
so
full
of
dangers
even
by
day
how
was
he
to
risk
his
vessel
in
the
depth
of
black
night
in
that
inextricable
labyrinth
that
ambuscade
of
shoals
there
was
not
help
for
it
he
must
wait
for
the
morrow
these
six
hours
lost
entailed
a
loss
of
twelve
hours
at
least
he
could
not
even
advance
the
labour
by
opening
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
his
breakwater
was
necessary
against
the
next
tide
he
was
compelled
to
rest
folding
his
arms
was
almost
the
only
thing
which
he
had
not
yet
done
since
his
arrival
on
the
rocks
this
forced
inaction
irritated
almost
vexed
him
with
himself
as
if
it
had
been
his
fault
he
thought
what
would
déruchette
say
of
me
if
she
saw
me
thus
doing
nothing
and
yet
this
interval
for
regaining
his
strength
was
not
unnecessary
the
sloop
was
now
at
his
command
he
determined
to
pass
the
night
in
it
he
mounted
once
more
to
fetch
his
sheepskin
upon
the
great
douvre
descended
again
supped
off
a
few
limpets
and
de
drank
being
very
thirsty
a
few
draughts
of
water
from
his
can
which
was
nearly
empty
enveloped
himself
in
the
skin
the
wool
of
which
felt
comforting
lay
down
like
a
beside
the
engine
drew
his
red
cap
over
his
eyes
and
slept
his
sleep
was
profound
it
was
such
sleep
as
men
enjoy
who
have
completed
a
great
labour
x
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
awoke
suddenly
and
with
a
jerk
like
the
recoil
of
a
spring
he
opened
his
eyes
the
douvres
rising
high
over
his
head
were
lighted
up
as
by
the
white
glow
of
burning
embers
over
all
the
dark
escarpment
of
the
rock
there
was
a
light
like
the
reflection
of
a
fire
where
could
this
fire
come
from
it
was
from
the
water
the
aspect
of
the
sea
was
extraordinary
the
water
seemed
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
among
the
reefs
and
beyond
them
the
sea
ran
with
flame
the
flame
was
not
red
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
grand
living
fires
of
volcanic
craters
or
of
great
furnaces
there
was
no
sparkling
no
glare
no
purple
edges
no
noise
long
trails
of
a
pale
tint
simulated
upon
the
water
the
folds
of
a
a
trembling
glow
was
spread
over
the
waves
it
was
the
spectre
of
a
great
fire
rather
than
the
fire
itself
it
was
in
some
degree
like
the
glow
of
unearthly
flames
lighting
the
inside
of
a
sepulchre
a
burning
darkness
the
night
itself
dim
vast
and
was
the
fuel
of
that
cold
flame
it
was
a
strange
illumination
issuing
out
of
blindness
the
shadows
even
formed
part
of
that
the
sailors
of
the
channel
are
familiar
with
those
indescribable
phosphorescences
full
of
warning
for
the
navigator
they
are
nowhere
more
surprising
than
in
the
great
v
near
isigny
by
this
light
surrounding
objects
lose
their
reality
a
spectral
glimmer
renders
them
as
it
were
transparent
rocks
become
no
more
than
outlines
cables
of
anchors
look
like
iron
bars
heated
to
a
white
heat
the
nets
of
the
fishermen
beneath
the
water
seem
webs
of
fire
the
half
of
the
oar
above
the
waves
is
dark
as
ebony
the
rest
in
the
sea
like
silver
the
drops
from
the
blades
uplifted
from
the
water
fall
in
starry
showers
upon
the
sea
every
boat
leaves
a
furrow
behind
it
like
a
comet
tail
the
sailors
wet
and
luminous
seem
like
men
in
flames
if
you
plunge
a
hand
into
the
water
you
withdraw
it
clothed
in
flame
the
flame
is
dead
and
is
not
felt
your
arm
becomes
a
firebrand
you
see
the
forms
of
things
in
the
sea
roll
beneath
the
waves
as
in
liquid
fire
the
foam
twinkles
the
fish
are
tongues
of
fire
or
fragments
of
the
forked
lightning
moving
in
the
depths
the
reflection
of
this
brightness
had
passed
over
the
closed
eyelids
of
gilliatt
in
the
sloop
it
was
this
that
had
awakened
him
his
awakening
was
opportune
the
ebb
tide
had
run
out
and
the
waters
were
beginning
to
rise
again
the
funnel
which
had
become
disengaged
during
his
sleep
was
about
to
enter
again
into
the
yawning
hollow
above
it
it
was
rising
slowly
a
rise
of
another
foot
would
have
entangled
it
in
the
wreck
again
a
rise
of
one
foot
is
equivalent
to
tide
if
he
intended
therefore
to
take
advantage
of
that
temporary
deliverance
once
more
within
his
reach
he
had
just
before
him
he
leaped
to
his
feet
urgent
as
the
situation
was
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
meditative
contemplating
the
phosphorescence
of
the
waves
gilliatt
knew
the
sea
in
all
its
phases
notwithstanding
all
her
tricks
and
often
as
he
had
suffered
from
her
terrors
he
had
long
been
her
companion
that
mysterious
entity
which
we
call
the
ocean
had
nothing
in
its
secret
thoughts
which
he
could
not
divine
observation
meditation
and
solitude
had
given
him
a
quick
perception
of
coming
changes
of
wind
or
cloud
or
wave
gilliatt
hastened
to
the
top
ropes
and
payed
out
some
cable
then
being
no
longer
held
fast
by
the
anchors
he
seized
the
of
the
sloop
and
pushed
her
towards
the
entrance
to
the
gorge
some
fathoms
from
the
durande
and
quite
near
to
the
breakwater
here
as
the
guernsey
sailors
say
it
had
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
sloop
was
withdrawn
from
beneath
the
carcase
of
the
wreck
there
was
no
further
danger
of
the
funnel
being
caught
in
a
trap
the
tide
might
rise
now
and
yet
gilliatt
manner
was
not
that
of
one
about
to
take
his
departure
he
stood
considering
the
light
upon
the
sea
once
more
but
his
thoughts
were
not
of
starting
he
was
thinking
of
how
to
fix
the
sloop
again
and
how
to
fix
it
more
firmly
than
ever
though
near
to
the
exit
from
the
defile
up
to
this
time
he
had
only
used
the
two
anchors
of
the
sloop
and
had
not
yet
employed
the
little
anchor
of
the
durande
which
he
had
found
as
will
be
remembered
among
the
breakers
this
anchor
had
been
deposited
by
him
in
readiness
for
any
emergency
in
a
corner
of
the
sloop
with
a
quantity
of
hawsers
and
blocks
of
and
his
cable
all
furnished
beforehand
with
large
knots
which
prevented
its
dragging
he
now
let
go
this
third
anchor
taking
care
to
fasten
the
cable
to
a
rope
one
end
of
which
was
slung
through
the
anchor
ring
while
the
other
was
attached
to
the
windlass
of
the
sloop
in
this
manner
he
made
a
kind
of
triangular
triple
anchorage
much
stronger
than
the
moorings
with
two
anchors
all
this
indicated
keen
anxiety
and
a
redoubling
of
precautions
a
sailor
would
have
seen
in
this
operation
something
similar
to
an
anchorage
in
bad
weather
when
there
is
fear
of
a
current
which
might
carry
the
vessel
under
the
wind
the
phosphorescence
which
he
had
been
observing
and
upon
which
his
eye
was
now
fixed
once
more
was
threatening
but
serviceable
at
the
same
time
but
for
it
he
would
have
been
held
fast
locked
in
sleep
and
deceived
by
the
night
the
strange
appearance
upon
the
sea
had
awakened
him
and
made
things
about
him
visible
the
light
which
it
shed
among
the
rocks
was
indeed
ominous
but
disquieting
as
it
appeared
to
be
to
gilliatt
it
had
served
to
show
him
the
dangers
of
his
position
and
had
rendered
possible
his
operations
in
extricating
the
sloop
henceforth
whenever
he
should
be
able
to
set
sail
the
vessel
with
its
freight
of
machinery
would
be
free
and
yet
the
idea
of
departing
was
further
than
ever
from
his
mind
the
sloop
being
fixed
in
its
new
position
he
went
in
quest
of
the
strongest
chain
which
he
had
in
his
and
attaching
it
to
the
nails
driven
into
the
two
douvres
he
fortified
from
within
with
this
chain
the
rampart
of
planks
and
beams
already
protected
from
without
by
the
cross
chain
far
from
opening
the
entrance
to
the
defile
he
made
the
barrier
more
complete
the
phosphorescence
lighted
him
still
but
it
was
diminishing
the
day
however
was
beginning
to
break
suddenly
he
paused
to
listen
xi
a
word
to
the
wise
is
enough
a
feeble
indistinct
sound
seemed
to
reach
his
ear
from
somewhere
in
the
far
distance
at
certain
hours
the
great
deeps
give
forth
a
murmuring
noise
he
listened
a
second
time
the
distant
noise
recommenced
gilliatt
shook
his
head
like
one
who
recognises
at
last
something
familiar
to
him
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
alley
between
the
rocks
at
the
entrance
facing
the
east
which
had
remained
open
until
then
and
by
heavy
blows
of
his
hammer
was
driving
large
nails
into
the
sides
of
the
gullet
near
the
man
rock
as
he
had
done
at
the
gullet
of
the
douvres
the
crevices
of
these
rocks
were
prepared
and
well
furnished
with
timber
almost
all
of
which
was
heart
of
oak
the
rock
on
this
side
being
much
broken
up
there
were
abundant
cracks
and
he
was
able
to
fix
even
more
nails
there
than
in
the
base
of
the
two
douvres
suddenly
and
as
if
some
great
breath
had
passed
over
it
the
luminous
appearance
on
the
waters
vanished
the
twilight
becoming
paler
every
moment
assumed
its
functions
the
nails
being
driven
gilliatt
dragged
beams
and
cords
and
then
chains
to
the
spot
and
without
taking
his
eyes
off
his
work
or
permitting
his
mind
to
be
diverted
for
a
moment
he
began
to
construct
across
the
gorge
of
the
man
with
beams
fixed
horizontally
and
made
fast
by
cables
one
of
those
open
barriers
which
science
has
now
adopted
under
the
name
of
breakwaters
those
who
have
witnessed
for
example
at
la
rocquaine
in
guernsey
or
at
in
france
the
effect
produced
by
a
few
posts
fixed
in
the
rock
will
understand
the
power
of
these
simple
preparations
this
sort
of
breakwater
is
a
combination
of
what
is
called
in
france
with
what
is
known
in
england
as
a
dam
the
breakwater
is
the
of
fortifications
against
tempests
man
can
only
struggle
against
the
sea
by
taking
advantage
of
this
principle
of
dividing
its
forces
meanwhile
the
sun
had
risen
and
was
shining
brightly
the
sky
was
clear
the
sea
calm
gilliatt
pressed
on
his
work
he
too
was
calm
but
there
was
anxiety
in
his
haste
he
passed
with
long
strides
from
rock
to
rock
and
returned
dragging
wildly
sometimes
a
rider
sometimes
a
binding
strake
the
utility
of
all
this
preparation
of
timbers
now
became
manifest
it
was
evident
that
he
was
about
to
confront
a
danger
which
he
had
foreseen
a
strong
iron
bar
served
him
as
a
lever
for
moving
the
beams
the
work
was
executed
so
fast
that
it
was
rather
a
rapid
growth
than
a
construction
he
who
has
never
seen
a
military
pontooner
at
his
work
can
scarcely
form
an
idea
of
this
rapidity
the
eastern
gullet
was
still
narrower
than
the
western
there
were
but
five
or
six
feet
of
interval
between
the
rocks
the
smallness
of
this
opening
was
an
assistance
the
space
to
be
fortified
and
closed
up
being
very
little
the
apparatus
would
be
stronger
and
might
be
more
simple
horizontal
beams
therefore
sufficed
the
upright
ones
being
useless
the
first
cross
pieces
of
the
breakwater
being
fixed
gilliatt
mounted
upon
them
and
listened
once
more
the
murmurs
had
become
significant
he
continued
his
construction
he
supported
it
with
the
two
of
the
durande
bound
to
the
frame
of
beams
by
cords
passed
through
the
three
he
made
the
whole
fast
by
chains
the
construction
was
little
more
than
a
colossal
hurdle
having
beams
for
rods
and
chains
in
the
place
of
wattles
it
seemed
woven
together
quite
as
much
as
built
he
multiplied
the
fastenings
and
added
nails
where
they
were
necessary
having
obtained
a
great
quantity
of
bar
iron
from
the
wreck
he
had
been
able
to
make
a
large
number
of
these
heavy
nails
while
still
at
work
he
broke
some
biscuit
with
his
teeth
he
was
thirsty
but
he
could
not
drink
having
no
more
fresh
water
he
had
emptied
the
can
at
his
meal
of
the
evening
before
he
added
afterwards
four
or
five
more
pieces
of
timber
then
climbed
again
upon
the
barrier
and
listened
the
noises
from
the
horizon
had
ceased
all
was
still
the
sea
was
smooth
and
quiet
deserving
all
those
complimentary
phrases
which
worthy
citizens
bestow
upon
it
when
satisfied
with
a
trip
a
mirror
a
pond
like
oil
and
so
forth
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
responded
to
the
deep
green
tint
of
the
ocean
the
sapphire
and
the
emerald
hues
vied
with
each
other
each
were
perfect
not
a
cloud
on
high
not
a
line
of
foam
below
in
the
midst
of
all
this
splendour
the
april
sun
rose
magnificently
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
lovelier
day
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
a
flight
of
birds
of
passage
formed
a
long
dark
line
against
the
sky
they
were
flying
fast
as
if
alarmed
gilliatt
set
to
work
again
to
raise
the
breakwater
he
raised
it
as
high
as
he
could
as
high
indeed
as
the
curving
of
the
rocks
would
permit
towards
noon
the
sun
appeared
to
him
to
give
more
than
its
usual
warmth
noon
is
the
critical
time
of
the
day
standing
upon
the
powerful
frame
which
he
had
built
up
he
paused
again
to
survey
the
wide
expanse
the
sea
was
more
than
tranquil
it
was
a
dull
dead
calm
no
sail
was
visible
the
sky
was
everywhere
clear
but
from
blue
it
had
become
white
the
whiteness
was
singular
to
the
west
and
upon
the
horizon
was
a
little
spot
of
a
sickly
hue
the
spot
remained
in
the
same
place
but
by
degrees
grew
larger
near
the
breakers
the
waves
shuddered
but
very
gently
gilliatt
had
done
well
to
build
his
breakwater
a
tempest
was
approaching
the
elements
had
determined
to
give
battle
book
iii
the
struggle
i
extremes
meet
nothing
is
more
threatening
than
a
late
equinox
the
appearance
of
the
sea
presents
a
strange
phenomenon
resulting
from
what
may
be
called
the
arrival
of
the
ocean
winds
in
all
seasons
but
particularly
at
the
epoch
of
the
syzygies
at
the
moment
when
least
expected
the
sea
sometimes
becomes
singularly
tranquil
that
vast
perpetual
movement
ceases
a
sort
of
drowsiness
and
languor
overspreads
it
and
it
seems
weary
and
about
to
rest
every
rag
of
bunting
from
the
tiny
streamer
of
the

the
great
flag
of
ships
of

against
the
mast
the

the
royal
and
imperial
ensigns
sleep
alike
suddenly
all
these
streamers
begin
to
flutter
gently
if
there
happen
to
be
clouds
the
moment
has
then
come
for
marking
the
formation
of
the
if
the
sun
is
setting
for
observing
the
red
tints
of
the
horizon
or
if
it
be
night
and
there
is
a
moon
for
looking
attentively
for
the
halo
it
is
then
that
the
captain
or
commander
of
a
squadron
if
he
happen
to
possess
one
of
those
storm
indicators
the
inventor
of
which
is
unknown
notes
his
instrument
carefully
and
takes
his
precautions
against
the
south
wind
if
the
clouds
have
an
appearance
like
dissolved
sugar
or
against
the
north
if
they
exfoliate
in
crystallisations
like
brakes

like

and
then
there
is
a
convulsion
the
rumour
becomes
tumult
as
the
wave
becomes
surge
the
horizon
a
confused
mass
of
strata
oscillating
ceaselessly
murmurs
in
a
continual
undertone
strange
and
sudden
outbursts
break
through
the
monotony
cold
airs
rush
forth
succeeded
by
warm
blasts
the
trepidation
of
the
sea
betokens
anxious
expectation
agony
terror
profound
suddenly
the
hurricane
comes
down
like
a
wild
beast
to
drink
of
the
ocean
a
monstrous
draught
the
sea
rises
to
the
invisible
mouth
a
mound
of
water
is
formed
the
swell
increases
and
the
waterspout
appears
the
prester
of
the
ancients
stalactite
above
stalagmite
below
a
whirling
cone
a
point
in
equilibrium
upon
another
the
embrace
of
two
mountains
a
mountain
of
foam
ascending
a
mountain
of
vapour
descending
terrible
coition
of
the
cloud
and
the
wave
like
the
column
in
holy
writ
the
waterspout
is
dark
by
day
and
luminous
by
night
in
its
presence
the
thunder
itself
is
silent
and
seems
cowed
the
vast
commotion
of
those
solitudes
has
its
gamut
a
terrible
crescendo
there
are
the
gust
the
squall
the
storm
the
gale
the
tempest
the
whirlwind
the
waterspout
the
seven
chords
of
the
lyre
of
the
winds
the
seven
notes
of
the
firmament
the
heavens
are
a
clear
space
the
sea
a
vast
round
but
a
breath
passes
they
have
vanished
and
all
is
fury
and
wild
confusion
such
are
these
inhospitable
realms
the
winds
rush
fly
swoop
down
dwindle
away
commence
again
hover
above
whistle
roar
and
smile
they
are
frenzied
wanton
unbridled
or
sinking
at
ease
upon
the
raging
waves
their
howlings
have
a
harmony
of
their
own
they
make
all
the
heavens
sonorous
they
blow
in
the
cloud
as
in
a
trumpet
they
sing
through
the
infinite
space
with
the
mingled
tones
of
clarions
horns
bugles
and
trumpets
a
sort
of
promethean
fanfare
such
was
the
music
of
ancient
pan
their
harmonies
are
terrible
they
have
a
colossal
joy
in
the
darkness
they
drive
and
disperse
great
ships
night
and
day
in
all
seasons
from
the
tropics
to
the
pole
there
is
no
truce
sounding
their
fatal
trumpet
through
the
tangled
thickets
of
the
clouds
and
waves
they
pursue
the
grim
chase
of
vessels
in
distress
they
have
their
packs
of
bloodhounds
and
take
their
pleasure
setting
them
to
bark
among
the
rocks
and
billows
they
huddle
the
clouds
together
and
drive
them
diverse
they
mould
and
knead
the
supple
waters
as
with
a
million
hands
the
water
is
supple
because
it
is
incompressible
it
slips
away
without
effort
borne
down
on
one
side
it
escapes
on
the
other
it
is
thus
that
waters
become
waves
and
that
the
billows
are
a
token
of
their
liberty
iii
the
noises
explained
the
grand
descent
of
winds
upon
the
world
takes
place
at
the
equinoxes
at
this
period
the
balance
of
tropic
and
pole
librates
and
the
vast
atmospheric
tides
pour
their
flood
upon
one
hemisphere
and
their
ebb
upon
another
the
signs
of
libra
and
aquarius
have
reference
to
these
phenomena
it
is
the
time
of
tempests
the
sea
awaits
their
coming
keeping
silence
sometimes
the
sky
looks
sickly
its
face
is
wan
a
thick
dark
veil
obscures
it
the
mariners
observe
with
uneasiness
the
angry
aspect
of
the
clouds
but
it
is
its
air
of
calm
contentment
which
they
dread
the
most
a
smiling
sky
in
the
equinoxes
is
the
tempest
in
gay
disguise
it
was
under
skies
like
these
that
the
tower
of
weeping
women
in
amsterdam
was
filled
with
wives
and
mothers
scanning
the
far
horizon
when
the
vernal
or
autumnal
storms
delay
to
break
they
are
gathering
strength
hoarding
up
their
fury
for
more
sure
destruction
beware
of
the
gale
that
has
been
long
delayed
it
was
angot
who
said
that
the
sea
pays
well
old
debts
when
the
delay
is
unusually
long
the
sea
betokens
her
impatience
only
by
a
deeper
calm
but
the
magnetic
intensity
manifests
itself
by
what
might
be
called
a
fiery
humour
in
the
sea
fire
issues
from
the
waves
electric
air
phosphoric
water
the
sailors
feel
a
strange
lassitude
this
time
is
particularly
perilous
for
iron
vessels
their
hulls
are
then
liable
to
produce
variations
of
the
compass
leading
them
to
destruction
the
transatlantic
perished
from
this
cause
to
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
sea
its
aspect
at
these
moments
is
singular
it
may
be
imagined
to
be
both
desiring
and
fearing
the
approach
of
the
cyclone
certain
unions
though
strongly
urged
by
nature
are
attended
by
this
strange
conjunction
of
terror
and
desire
the
lioness
in
her
tenderest
moods
flies
from
the
lion
thus
the
sea
in
the
fire
of
her
passion
trembles
at
the
near
approach
of
her
union
with
the
tempest
the
nuptials
are
prepared
like
the
marriages
of
the
ancient
emperors
they
are
celebrated
with
immolations
the
fête
is
heralded
with
disasters
meanwhile
from
yonder
deeps
from
the
great
open
sea
from
the
unapproachable
latitudes
from
the
lurid
horizon
of
the
watery
waste
from
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
free
ocean
the
winds
pour
down
listen
for
this
is
the
famous
equinox
the
storm
prepares
mischief
in
the
old
mythology
these
entities
were
recognised
indistinctly
moving
in
the
grand
scene
of
nature
eolus
plotted
with
boreas
the
alliance
of
element
with
element
is
necessary
they
divide
their
task
one
has
to
give
impetus
to
the

the

the
stream
night
is
an
auxiliary
and
must
be
employed
there
are
compasses
to
be
falsified
beacons
to
be
extinguished
lanterns
of
lighthouses
to
be
masked
stars
to
be
hidden
the
sea
must
lend
her
aid
every
storm
is
preceded
by
a
murmur
behind
the
horizon
line
there
is
a
premonitory
whispering
among
the
hurricanes
this
is
the
noise
which
is
heard
afar
off
in
the
darkness
amidst
the
terrible
silence
of
the
sea
it
was
this
significant
whispering
which
gilliatt
had
noted
the
phosphorescence
on
the
water
had
been
the
first
warning
this
murmur
the
second
if
the
demon
legion
exists
he
is
assuredly
no
other
than
the
wind
the
wind
is
complex
but
the
air
is
one
hence
it
follows
that
all
storms
are
mixed
a
principle
which
results
from
the
unity
of
the
air
the
entire
abyss
of
heaven
takes
part
in
a
tempest
the
entire
ocean
also
the
totality
of
its
forces
is
marshalled
for
the
strife
a
wave
is
the
ocean
gulf
a
gust
is
a
gulf
of
the
atmosphere
a
contest
with
a
storm
is
a
contest
with
all
the
powers
of
sea
and
sky
it
was
messier
that
great
authority
among
naval
men
the
pensive
astronomer
of
the
little
lodge
at
cluny
who
said
the
wind
comes
from
everywhere
and
is
everywhere
he
had
no
faith
in
the
idea
of
winds
imprisoned
even
in
inland
seas
with
him
there
were
no
mediterranean
winds
he
declared
that
he
recognised
them
as
they
wandered
about
the
earth
he
affirmed
that
on
a
certain
day
at
a
certain
hour
the
föhn
of
the
lake
of
constance
the
ancient
favonius
of
lucretius
had
traversed
the
horizon
of
paris
on
another
day
the
bora
of
the
adriatic
on
another
day
the
whirling
notus
which
is
supposed
to
be
confined
in
the
round
of
the
cyclades
he
indicated
their
currents
he
did
not
believe
it
impossible
that
the
autan
which
circulates
between
corsica
and
the
balearic
isles
could
escape
from
its
bounds
he
did
not
admit
the
theory
of
winds
imprisoned
like
bears
in
their
dens
it
was
he
too
who
said
that
every
rain
comes
from
the
tropics
and
every
flash
of
lightning
from
the
pole
the
wind
in
fact
becomes
saturated
with
electricity
at
the
intersection
of
the
colures
which
marks
the
extremity
of
the
axis
and
with
water
at
the
equator
bringing
moisture
from
the
equatorial
line
and
the
electric
fluid
from
the
poles
the
wind
is
ubiquitous
it
is
certainly
not
meant
by
this
that
the
winds
never
move
in
zones
nothing
is
better
established
than
the
existence
of
those
continuous
air
currents
and
aerial
navigation
by
means
of
the
wind
boats
to
which
the
passion
for
greek
terminology
has
given
the
name
of
aeroscaphes
may
one
day
succeed
in
utilising
the
chief
of
these
streams
of
wind
the
regular
course
of
air
streams
is
an
incontestable
fact
there
are
both
rivers
of
wind
and
rivulets
of
wind
although
their
branches
are
exactly
the
reverse
of
water
currents
for
in
the
air
it
is
the
rivulets
which
flow
out
of
the
rivers
and
the
smaller
rivers
which
flow
out
of
the
great
streams
instead
of
falling
into
them
hence
instead
of
concentration
we
have
dispersion
the
united
action
of
the
winds
and
the
unity
of
the
atmosphere
result
from
this
dispersion
the
displacement
of
one
molecule
produces
the
displacement
of
another
the
vast
body
of
air
becomes
subject
to
one
agitation
to
these
profound
causes
of
coalition
we
must
add
the
irregular
surface
of
the
earth
whose
mountains
furrow
the
atmosphere
contorting
and
diverting
the
winds
from
their
course
and
determining
the
directions
of
counter
currents
in
infinite
radiations
the
phenomenon
of
the
wind
is
the
oscillation
of
two
oceans
one
against
the
other
the
ocean
of
air
superimposed
upon
the
ocean
of
water
rests
upon
these
currents
and
is
convulsed
with
this
vast
agitation
the
indivisible
can
not
produce
separate
action
no
partition
divides
wave
from

the
islands
of
the
channel
feel
the
influence
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
navigation
everywhere
contends
with
the
same
monster
the
sea
is
one
hydra
the
waves
cover
it
as
with
a
coat
of
scales
the
ocean
is
ceto
upon
that
unity
reposes
an
infinite

the

the

rock
heard
their
distant
tramp
at
the
moment
when
gilliatt
was
constructing
his
breakwater
as
we
have
said
the
wind
means
the
combination
of
all
the
winds
of
the
earth
v
gilliatt
alternatives
the
mysterious
forces
had
chosen
their
time
well
chance
if
chance
exists
is
sometimes
while
the
sloop
had
been
anchored
in
the
little
creek
of
the
man
rock
and
as
long
as
the
machinery
had
been
prisoned
in
the
wreck
position
had
been
impregnable
the
sloop
was
in
safety
the
machinery
sheltered
the
douvres
which
held
the
hull
of
the
durande
fast
condemned
it
to
slow
destruction
but
protected
it
against
unexpected
accidents
in
any
event
one
resource
had
remained
to
him
if
the
engine
had
been
destroyed
gilliatt
would
have
been
uninjured
he
had
still
the
sloop
by
which
to
escape
but
to
wait
till
the
sloop
was
removed
from
the
anchorage
where
she
was
inaccessible
to
allow
it
to
be
fixed
in
the
defile
of
the
douvres
to
watch
until
the
sloop
too
was
as
it
were
entangled
in
the
rocks
to
permit
him
to
complete
the
salvage
the
moving
and
the
final
embarkation
of
the
machinery
to
do
no
damage
to
that
wonderful
construction
by
which
one
man
was
enabled
to
put
the
whole
aboard
his
bark
to
acquiesce
in
fact
in
the
success
of
his
exploits
so
far
this
was
but
the
trap
which
the
elements
had
laid
for
him
now
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
perceive
in
all
its
sinister
characteristics
the
trick
which
the
sea
had
been
meditating
so
long
the
machinery
the
sloop
and
their
master
were
all
now
within
the
gorge
of
the
rocks
they
formed
but
a
single
point
one
blow
and
the
sloop
might
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rock
the
machinery
destroyed
and
gilliatt
drowned
the
situation
could
not
have
been
more
critical
the
sphinx
which
men
have
imagined
concealing
herself
in
the
cloud
seemed
to
mock
him
with
a
dilemma
go
or
stay
to
go
would
have
been
madness
to
remain
was
terrible
vi
the
combat
gilliatt
ascended
to
the
summit
of
the
great
douvre
from
hence
he
could
see
around
the
horizon
the
western
side
was
appalling
a
wall
of
cloud
spread
across
it
barring
the
wide
expanse
from
side
to
side
and
ascending
slowly
from
the
horizon
towards
the
zenith
this
wall
straight
lined
vertical
without
a
crevice
in
its
height
without
a
rent
in
its
structure
seemed
built
by
the
square
and
measured
by
the
it
was
cloud
in
the
likeness
of
granite
its
escarpment
completely
perpendicular
at
the
southern
extremity
curved
a
little
towards
the
north
like
a
bent
sheet
of
iron
presenting
the
steep
slippery
face
of
an
inclined
plane
the
dark
wall
enlarged
and
grew
but
its
entablature
never
ceased
for
a
moment
to
be
parallel
with
the
horizon
line
which
was
almost
indistinguishable
in
the
gathering
darkness
silently
and
altogether
the
airy
battlements
ascended
no
undulation
no
wrinkle
no
projection
changed
its
shape
or
moved
its
place
the
aspect
of
this
immobility
in
movement
was
impressive
the
sun
pale
in
the
midst
of
a
strange
sickly
transparence
lighted
up
this
outline
of
the
apocalypse
already
the
cloudy
bank
had
blotted
out
one
half
the
space
of
the
sky
shelving
like
the
fearful
talus
of
the
abyss
it
was
the
uprising
of
a
dark
mountain
between
earth
and
heaven
it
was
night
falling
suddenly
upon
midday
there
was
a
heat
in
the
air
as
from
an
oven
door
coming
from
that
mysterious
mass
on
mass
the
sky
which
from
blue
had
become
white
was
now
turning
from
white
to
a
slatey
grey
the
sea
beneath
was
and
dull
there
was
no
breath
no
wave
no
noise
far
as
eye
could
reach
the
desert
ocean
no
sail
was
visible
on
any
side
the
birds
had
disappeared
some
monstrous
treason
seemed
abroad
the
wall
of
cloud
grew
visibly
larger
this
moving
mountain
of
vapours
which
was
approaching
the
douvres
was
one
of
those
clouds
which
might
be
called
the
clouds
of
battle
sinister
appearances
some
strange
furtive
glance
seemed
cast
upon
the
beholder
through
that
obscure
mass
the
approach
was
terrible
gilliatt
observed
it
closely
and
muttered
to
himself
i
am
thirsty
enough
but
you
will
give
me
plenty
to
drink
he
stood
there
motionless
a
few
moments
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
cloud
bank
as
if
mentally
taking
a
sounding
of
the
tempest
his
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
he
took
it
out
and
placed
it
on
his
head
then
he
fetched
from
the
cave
which
had
so
long
served
him
for
a
a
few
things
which
he
had
kept
there
in
reserve
he
put
on
his
overalls
and
attired
himself
in
his
waterproof
overcoat
like
a
knight
who
puts
on
his
armour
at
the
moment
of
battle
he
had
no
shoes
but
his
naked
feet
had
become
hardened
to
the
rocks
this
preparation
for
the
storm
being
completed
he
looked
down
upon
his
breakwater
grasped
the
knotted
cord
hurriedly
descended
from
the
plateau
of
the
douvre
stepped
on
to
the
rocks
below
and
hastened
to
his
store
cavern
a
few
moments
later
he
was
at
work
the
vast
silent
cloud
might
have
heard
the
strokes
of
his
hammer
with
the
nails
ropes
and
beams
which
still
remained
he
constructed
for
the
eastern
gullet
a
second
frame
which
he
succeeded
in
fixing
at
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
other
the
silence
was
still
profound
the
blades
of
grass
between
the
cracks
of
the
rocks
were
not
stirred
the
sun
disappeared
suddenly
gilliatt
looked
up
the
rising
cloud
had
just
reached
it
it
was
like
the
blotting
out
of
day
succeeded
by
a
mingled
pale
reflection
the
immense
wall
of
cloud
had
changed
its
appearance
it
no
longer
retained
its
unity
it
had
curved
on
reaching
the
zenith
whence
it
spread
horizontally
over
the
rest
of
the
heavens
it
had
now
its
various
stages
the
tempest
formation
was
visible
like
the
strata
in
the
side
of
a
trench
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
the
layers
of
the
rain
from
the
beds
of
hail
there
was
no
lightning
but
a
horrible
diffused
glare
for
the
idea
of
horror
may
be
attached
to
light
the
vague
breathing
of
the
storm
was
audible
the
silence
was
broken
by
an
obscure
palpitation
gilliatt
silent
also
watched
the
giant
blocks
of
vapour
grouping
themselves
overhead
forming
the
shapeless
mass
of
clouds
upon
the
horizon
brooded
and
lengthened
out
a
band
of
mist
of
ashen
hue
in
the
zenith
another
band
of
lead
colour
pale
ragged
fragments
of
cloud
hung
from
the
great
mass
above
upon
the
mist
below
the
pile
of
cloud
which
formed
the
background
was
wan
dull
gloomy
a
thin
whitish
transverse
cloud
coming
no
one
could
tell
whither
cut
the
high
dark
wall
obliquely
from
north
to
south
one
of
the
extremities
of
this
cloud
trailed
along
the
surface
of
the
sea
at
the
point
where
it
touched
the
waters
a
dense
red
vapour
was
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
below
it
smaller
clouds
quite
black
and
very
low
were
flying
as
if
bewildered
or
moved
by
opposite
currents
of
air
the
immense
cloud
beyond
increased
from
all
points
at
once
darkened
the
eclipse
and
continued
to
spread
its
sombre
pall
in
the
east
behind
gilliatt
there
was
only
one
clear
porch
in
the
heavens
which
was
rapidly
being
closed
without
any
feeling
of
wind
abroad
a
strange
flight
of
grey
downy
particles
seemed
to
pass
they
were
fine
and
scattered
as
if
some
gigantic
bird
had
been
plucked
of
its
plumage
behind
the
bank
of
cloud
a
dark
compact
roof
had
gradually
formed
itself
which
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
touched
the
sea
and
mingled
in
darkness
with
it
the
beholder
had
a
vague
sense
of
something
advancing
steadily
towards
him
it
was
vast
heavy
ominous
suddenly
an
immense
peal
of
thunder
burst
upon
the
air
gilliatt
himself
felt
the
shock
the
rude
reality
in
the
midst
of
that
visionary
region
has
something
in
it
terrific
the
listener
might
fancy
that
he
hears
something
falling
in
the
chamber
of
giants
no
electric
flash
accompanied
the
report
it
was
a
blind
peal
the
silence
was
profound
again
there
was
an
interval
as
when
combatants
take
up
their
position
then
appeared
slowly
one
after
the
other
great
shapeless
flashes
these
flashes
were
silent
the
wall
of
cloud
was
now
a
vast
cavern
with
roofs
and
arches
outlines
of
forms
were
traceable
among
them
monstrous
heads
were
vaguely
shadowed
forth
rocks
seemed
to
stretch
out
elephants
bearing
turrets
seen
for
a
moment
vanished
a
column
of
vapour
straight
round
and
dark
and
surmounted
by
a
white
mist
simulated
the
form
of
a
colossal
engulfed
hissing
and
smoking
beneath
the
waves
sheets
of
cloud
undulated
like
folds
of
giant
flags
in
the
centre
under
a
thick
purple
pall
a
nucleus
of
dense
fog
sunk
motionless
inert
impenetrable
by
the
electric
fires
a
sort
of
hideous
foetus
in
the
bosom
of
the
tempest
suddenly
gilliatt
felt
a
breath
moving
his
hair
two
or
three
large
spots
of
rain
fell
heavily
around
him
on
the
rock
then
there
was
a
second
the
wind
was
rising
the
terror
of
darkness
was
at
its
highest
point
the
first
peal
of
thunder
had
shaken
the
sea
the
second
rent
the
wall
of
cloud
from
top
to
base
breach
was
visible
the
deluge
rushed
towards
it
the
rent
became
like
a
gulf
filled
with
rain
the
outpouring
of
the
tempest
had
begun
the
moment
was
terrible
rain
wind
lightnings
thunder
waves
swirling
upwards
to
the
clouds
foam
hoarse
noises
whistlings
mingled
together
like
monsters
suddenly
unloosened
for
a
solitary
man
imprisoned
with
an
overloaded
vessel
between
two
dangerous
rocks
in
no
crisis
could
have
been
more
menacing
the
danger
of
the
tide
over
which
he
had
triumphed
was
nothing
compared
with
the
danger
of
the
tempest
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
dangers
gilliatt
at
the
last
moment
and
before
the
crowning
peril
had
developed
an
ingenious
strategy
he
had
secured
his
basis
of
operations
in
the
enemies
territory
had
pressed
the
rock
into
his
service
the
douvres
originally
his
enemy
had
become
his
second
in
that
immense
duel
out
of
that
sepulchre
he
had
constructed
a
fortress
he
was
built
up
among
those
formidable
sea
ruins
he
was
blockaded
but
well
defended
he
had
so
to
speak
set
his
back
against
the
wall
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
hurricane
he
had
barricaded
the
narrow
strait
that
highway
of
the
waves
this
indeed
was
the
only
possible
course
it
seemed
as
if
the
ocean
like
other
despots
might
be
brought
to
reason
by
the
aid
of
barricades
the
sloop
might
be
considered
secure
on
three
sides
closely
wedged
between
the
two
interior
walls
of
the
rock
made
fast
by
three
anchorings
she
was
sheltered
from
the
north
by
the
little
douvre
on
the
south
by
the
great
one
terrible
escarpments
more
accustomed
to
wreck
vessels
than
to
save
them
on
the
western
side
she
was
protected
by
the
frame
of
timbers
made
fast
and
nailed
to
the
rocks
a
tried
barrier
which
had
withstood
the
rude
of
the
sea
a
veritable
having
for
its
sides
the
columns
of
the
rock
the
two
douvres
themselves
nothing
was
to
be
feared
from
that
side
it
was
on
the
eastern
side
only
that
there
was
danger
on
that
side
there
was
no
protection
but
the
breakwater
a
breakwater
is
an
apparatus
for
dividing
and
distributing
it
requires
at
least
two
frames
gilliatt
had
only
had
time
to
construct
one
he
was
compelled
to
build
the
second
in
the
very
presence
of
the
tempest
fortunately
the
wind
came
from
the
the
wind
is
not
always
adroit
in
its
attacks
the
wind
which
is
the
ancient
galerno
had
little
effect
upon
the
douvres
it
assailed
the
rocks
in
flank
and
drove
the
waves
neither
against
the
one
nor
the
other
of
the
two
gullets
so
that
instead
of
rushing
into
a
defile
they
dashed
themselves
against
a
wall
but
the
currents
of
the
wind
are
curved
and
it
was
probable
that
there
would
be
some
sudden
change
if
it
should
veer
to
the
east
before
the
second
frame
could
be
constructed
the
peril
would
be
great
the
irruption
of
the
sea
into
the
gorge
would
be
complete
and
all
would
probably
be
lost
the
wildness
of
the
storm
went
on
increasing
the
essence
of
a
tempest
is
the
rapid
succession
of
its
blows
that
is
its
strength
but
it
is
also
its
weakness
its
fury
gives
the
opportunity
to
human
intelligence
and
man
spies
its
weak
points
for
his
defence
but
under
what
overwhelming
assaults
no
respite
no
interruption
no
truce
no
pause
for
taking
breath
there
seems
an
unspeakable
cowardice
in
that
prodigality
of
inexhaustible
resources
all
the
tumult
of
the
wide
expanse
rushed
towards
the
douvres
voices
were
heard
in
the
darkness
what
could
they
be
the
ancient
terror
of
the
sea
was
there
at
times
they
seemed
to
speak
as
if
some
one
was
uttering
words
of
command
there
were
clamours
strange
trepidations
and
then
that
majestic
roar
which
the
mariners
call
the
ocean
cry
the
indefinite
and
flying
eddies
of
the
wind
whistled
while
curling
the
waves
and
flinging
them
like
giant
quoits
cast
by
invisible
athletes
against
the
breakers
the
enormous
surf
streamed
over
all
the
rocks
torrents
above
foam
below
then
the
roaring
was
redoubled
no
uproar
of
men
or
beasts
could
yield
an
idea
of
that
din
which
mingled
with
the
incessant
breaking
of
the
sea
the
clouds
cannonaded
the
hailstones
poured
their
volleys
the
surf
mounted
to
the
assault
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
the
sea
was
white
ten
leagues
of
yeasty
water
filled
the
horizon
doors
of
fire
were
opened
clouds
seemed
burnt
by
clouds
and
showed
like
smoke
above
a
nebulous
red
mass
resembling
burning
embers
floating
conflagrations
rushed
together
and
amalgamated
each
changing
the
shape
of
the
other
from
the
midst
of
the
dark
roof
a
terrible
arsenal
appeared
to
be
emptied
out
hurling
downward
from
the
gulf
waterspouts
hail
torrents
purple
fire
phosphoric
gleams
darkness
and
lightnings
meanwhile
gilliatt
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
storm
his
head
was
bent
over
his
work
the
second
framework
began
to
approach
completion
to
every
clap
of
thunder
he
replied
with
a
blow
of
his
hammer
making
a
cadence
which
was
audible
even
amidst
that
tumult
he
was
bareheaded
for
a
gust
had
carried
away
his
he
suffered
from
a
burning
thirst
little
pools
of
rain
had
formed
in
the
rocks
around
him
from
time
to
time
he
took
some
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
drank
then
without
even
looking
upward
to
observe
the
storm
he
applied
himself
anew
to
his
task
all
might
depend
upon
a
moment
he
knew
the
fate
that
awaited
him
if
his
breakwater
should
not
be
completed
in
time
of
what
avail
could
it
be
to
lose
a
moment
in
looking
for
the
approach
of
death
the
turmoil
around
him
was
like
that
of
a
vast
bubbling
cauldron
crash
and
uproar
were
everywhere
sometimes
the
lightning
seemed
to
descend
a
sort
of
ladder
the
electric
flame
returned
incessantly
to
the
same
points
of
the
rock
where
there
were
probably
metallic
veins
hailstones
fell
of
enormous
size
gilliatt
was
compelled
to
shake
the
folds
of
his
overcoat
even
the
pockets
of
which
became
filled
with
hail
the
storm
had
now
rotated
to
the
west
and
was
expending
its
fury
upon
the
barricades
of
the
two
douvres
but
gilliatt
had
faith
in
his
breakwaters
and
with
good
reason
these
barricades
made
of
a
great
portion
of
the
of
the
durande
took
the
shock
of
the
waves
easily
elasticity
is
a
resistance
the
experiments
of
stephenson
establish
the
fact
that
against
the
waves
which
are
themselves
elastic
a
raft
of
timber
joined
and
chained
together
in
a
certain
fashion
will
form
a
more
powerful
obstacle
than
a
breakwater
of
masonry
the
barriers
of
the
douvres
fulfilled
these
conditions
they
were
moreover
so
ingeniously
made
fast
that
the
waves
striking
them
beneath
were
like
hammers
beating
in
nails
pressing
and
consolidating
the
work
upon
the
rocks
to
demolish
them
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
overthrow
the
douvres
themselves
the
surf
in
fact
was
only
able
to
cast
over
upon
the
sloop
some
flakes
of
foam
on
that
side
thanks
to
the
barrier
the
tempest
ended
only
in
harmless
insult
gilliatt
turned
his
back
upon
the
scene
he
heard
composedly
its
useless
rage
upon
the
rocks
behind
him
the
coming
from
all
sides
were
like
flights
of
down
the
vast
irritated
ocean
deluged
the
rocks
dashed
over
them
and
raged
within
penetrated
into
the
network
of
their
interior
fissures
and
issued
again
from
the
granitic
masses
by
the
narrow
chinks
forming
a
kind
of
inexhaustible
fountains
playing
peacefully
in
the
midst
of
that
deluge
here
and
there
a
silvery
network
fell
gracefully
from
these
spouts
in
the
sea
the
second
frame
of
the
eastern
barrier
was
nearly
completed
a
few
more
knots
of
rope
and
ends
of
chains
and
this
new
rampart
would
be
ready
to
play
its
part
in
barring
out
the
storm
suddenly
there
was
a
great
brightness
the
rain
ceased
the
clouds
rolled
asunder
the
wind
had
just
shifted
a
sort
of
high
dark
window
opened
in
the
zenith
and
the
lightnings
were
extinguished
the
end
seemed
to
have
come
it
was
but
the
commencement
the
change
of
wind
was
from
the
to
the
the
storm
was
preparing
to
burst
forth
again
with
a
new
legion
of
hurricanes
the
north
was
about
to
mount
to
the
assault
sailors
call
this
dreaded
moment
of
transition
the
return
storm
the
southern
wind
brings
most
rain
the
north
wind
most
lightning
the
attack
coming
now
from
the
east
was
directed
against
the
weak
point
of
the
position
this
time
gilliatt
interrupted
his
work
and
looked
around
him
he
stood
erect
upon
a
curved
projection
of
the
rock
behind
the
second
barrier
which
was
nearly
finished
if
the
first
frame
had
been
carried
away
it
would
have
broken
down
the
second
which
was
not
yet
consolidated
and
must
have
crushed
him
gilliatt
in
the
place
that
he
had
chosen
must
in
that
case
have
been
destroyed
before
seeing
the
sloop
the
machinery
and
all
his
work
shattered
and
swallowed
up
in
the
gulf
such
was
the
possibility
which
awaited
him
he
accepted
it
and
contemplated
it
sternly
in
that
wreck
of
all
his
hope
to
die
at
once
would
have
been
his
desire
to
die
first
as
he
would
have
regarded
it
for
the
machinery
produced
in
his
mind
the
effect
of
a
living
being
he
moved
aside
his
hair
which
was
beaten
over
his
eyes
by
the
wind
grasped
his
trusty
mallet
drew
himself
up
in
a
menacing
attitude
and
awaited
the
event
he
was
not
kept
long
in
suspense
a
flash
of
lightning
gave
the
signal
the
livid
opening
in
the
zenith
closed
a
driving
torrent
of
rain
fell
then
all
became
dark
save
where
the
lightnings
broke
forth
once
more
the
attack
had
recommenced
in
earnest
a
heavy
swell
visible
from
time
to
time
in
the
blaze
of
the
lightning
was
rolling
in
the
east
beyond
the
man
rock
it
resembled
a
huge
wall
of
glass
it
was
green
and
without
foam
and
it
stretched
across
the
wide
expanse
it
was
advancing
towards
the
breakwater
increasing
as
it
approached
it
was
a
singular
kind
of
gigantic
cylinder
rolling
upon
the
ocean
the
thunder
kept
up
a
hollow
rumbling
the
great
wave
struck
the
man
rock
broke
in
twain
and
passed
beyond
the
broken
wave
rejoined
formed
a
mountain
of
water
and
instead
of
advancing
in
parallel
line
as
before
came
down
perpendicularly
upon
the
breakwater
the
shock
was
terrific
the
whole
wave
became
a
roaring
surf
it
is
impossible
for
those
who
have
not
witnessed
them
to
imagine
those
snowy
avalanches
which
the
sea
thus
precipitates
and
under
which
it
engulfs
for
the
moment
rocks
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
height
such
for
example
as
the
great
anderlo
at
guernsey
and
the
pinnacle
at
jersey
at
saint
mary
of
madagascar
it
passes
completely
over
the
promontory
of
tintingue
for
some
moments
the
sea
drowned
everything
nothing
was
visible
except
the
furious
waters
an
enormous
breadth
of
foam
the
whiteness
of
a
blowing
in
the
draught
of
a
sepulchre
nothing
was
heard
but
the
roaring
storm
working
devastation
around
when
the
foam
subsided
gilliatt
was
still
standing
at
his
post
the
barrier
had
stood
firm
not
a
chain
was
broken
not
a
nail
displaced
it
had
exhibited
under
the
trial
the
two
chief
qualities
of
a
breakwater
it
had
proved
flexible
as
a
hurdle
and
firm
as
a
wall
the
surf
falling
upon
it
had
dissolved
into
a
shower
of
drops
a
river
of
foam
rushing
along
the
zigzags
of
the
defile
subsided
as
it
approached
the
sloop
the
man
who
had
put
this
curb
upon
the
fury
of
the
ocean
took
no
rest
the
storm
fortunately
turned
aside
its
fury
for
a
moment
the
fierce
attack
of
the
waves
was
renewed
upon
the
wall
of
the
rock
there
was
a
respite
and
gilliatt
took
advantage
of
it
to
complete
the
interior
barrier
the
daylight
faded
upon
his
labours
the
hurricane
continued
its
violence
upon
the
flank
of
the
rocks
with
a
mournful
solemnity
the
stores
of
fire
and
water
in
the
sky
poured
out
incessantly
without
exhausting
themselves
the
undulations
of
the
wind
above
and
below
were
like
the
movements
of
a
dragon
nightfall
brought
scarcely
any
deeper
night
the
change
was
hardly
felt
for
the
darkness
was
never
complete
tempests
alternately
darkening
and
illumining
by
their
lightnings
are
merely
intervals
of
the
visible
and
invisible
all
is
pale
glare
and
then
all
is
darkness
spectral
shapes
issue
forth
suddenly
and
return
as
suddenly
into
the
deep
shade
a
phosphoric
zone
tinged
with
the
hue
of
the
aurora
borealis
appeared
like
ghastly
flames
behind
the
dense
clouds
giving
to
all
things
a
wan
aspect
and
making
the
luminous
this
uncertain
light
aided
gilliatt
and
directed
him
in
his
operations
by
its
help
he
was
enabled
to
raise
the
forward
barrier
the
breakwater
was
now
almost
complete
as
he
was
engaged
in
making
fast
a
powerful
cable
to
the
last
beam
the
gale
blew
directly
in
his
face
this
compelled
him
to
raise
his
head
the
wind
had
shifted
abruptly
to
the
the
assault
upon
the
eastern
gullet
recommenced
gilliatt
cast
his
eyes
around
the
horizon
another
great
wall
of
water
was
approaching
the
wave
broke
with
a
great
shock
a
second
followed
then
another
and
another
still
then
five
or
six
almost
together
then
a
last
shock
of
tremendous
force
this
last
wave
which
was
an
accumulation
of
forces
had
a
singular
resemblance
to
a
living
thing
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
in
the
midst
of
that
swelling
mass
the
shapes
of
fins
and
it
fell
heavily
and
broke
upon
the
barriers
its
almost
animal
form
was
torn
to
pieces
in
the
shape
of
spouts
and
gushes
resembling
the
crushing
to
death
of
some
sea
hydra
upon
that
block
of
rocks
and
timbers
the
swell
rushed
through
subsiding
but
devastating
as
it
went
the
huge
wave
seemed
to
bite
and
cling
to
its
victim
as
it
died
the
rock
shook
to
its
base
a
savage
howling
mingled
with
the
roar
the
foam
flew
far
like
the
spouting
of
a
leviathan
the
subsidence
exhibited
the
extent
of
the
ravages
of
the
surf
this
last
escalade
had
not
been
ineffectual
the
breakwater
had
suffered
this
time
a
long
and
heavy
beam
torn
from
the
first
barrier
had
been
carried
over
the
second
and
hurled
violently
upon
the
projecting
rock
on
which
gilliatt
had
stood
but
a
moment
before
by
good
fortune
he
had
not
returned
there
had
he
done
so
his
death
had
been
inevitable
there
was
a
remarkable
circumstance
in
the
fall
of
this
beam
which
by
preventing
the
framework
rebounding
saved
gilliatt
from
greater
dangers
it
even
proved
useful
to
him
as
will
be
seen
in
another
way
between
the
projecting
rock
and
the
interior
wall
of
the
defile
there
was
a
large
interval
something
like
the
notch
of
an
axe
or
the
split
of
a
wedge
one
of
the
extremities
of
the
timber
hurled
into
the
air
by
the
waves
had
stuck
fast
into
this
notch
in
falling
the
gap
had
become
enlarged
gilliatt
was
struck
with
an
idea
it
was
that
of
bearing
heavily
on
the
other
extremity
the
beam
caught
by
one
end
in
the
nook
which
it
had
widened
projected
from
it
straight
as
an
outstretched
arm
this
species
of
arm
projected
parallel
with
the
anterior
wall
of
the
defile
and
the
disengaged
end
stretched
from
its
resting
place
about
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
a
good
distance
for
the
object
to
be
attained
gilliatt
raised
himself
by
means
of
his
hands
feet
and
knees
to
the
escarpment
and
then
turned
his
back
pressing
both
his
shoulders
against
the
enormous
lever
the
beam
was
long
which
increased
its
raising
power
the
rock
was
already
loosened
but
he
was
compelled
to
renew
his
efforts
again
and
again
the
rolled
from
his
forehead
as
rapidly
as
the
spray
the
fourth
attempt
exhausted
all
his
powers
there
was
a
cracking
noise
the
gap
spreading
in
the
shape
of
a
fissure
opened
its
vast
jaws
and
the
heavy
mass
fell
into
the
narrow
space
of
the
defile
with
a
noise
like
the
echo
of
the
thunder
the
mass
fell
straight
and
without
breaking
resting
in
its
bed
like
a
druid
cromlech
precipitated
in
one
piece
the
beam
which
had
served
as
a
lever
descended
with
the
rock
and
gilliatt
stumbling
forward
as
it
gave
way
narrowly
escaped
falling
the
bed
of
the
pass
at
this
part
was
full
of
huge
round
stones
and
there
was
little
water
the
monolith
lying
in
the
boiling
foam
the
flakes
of
which
fell
on
gilliatt
where
he
stood
stretched
from
side
to
side
of
the
great
parallel
rocks
of
the
defile
and
formed
a
transversal
wall
a
sort
of
between
the
two
escarpments
its
two
ends
touched
the
rocks
it
had
been
a
little
too
long
to
lie
flat
but
its
summit
of
soft
rock
was
struck
off
with
the
fall
the
result
of
this
fall
was
a
singular
sort
of
which
may
still
be
seen
the
water
behind
this
stony
barrier
is
almost
always
tranquil
this
was
a
rampart
more
invincible
still
than
the
forward
timbers
of
the
durande
fixed
between
the
two
douvres
the
barrier
came
opportunely
the
assaults
of
the
sea
had
continued
the
obstinacy
of
the
waves
is
always
increased
by
an
obstacle
the
first
frame
began
to
show
signs
of
breaking
up
one
breach
however
small
in
a
breakwater
is
always
serious
it
inevitably
enlarges
and
there
is
no
means
of
supplying
its
place
for
the
sea
would
sweep
away
the
workmen
a
flash
which
lighted
up
the
rocks
revealed
to
gilliatt
the
nature
of
the
mischief
the
beams
broken
down
the
ends
of
rope
and
fragments
of
chain
swinging
in
the
winds
and
a
rent
in
the
centre
of
the
apparatus
the
second
frame
was
intact
though
the
block
of
stone
so
powerfully
overturned
by
gilliatt
in
the
defile
behind
the
breakwater
was
the
strongest
possible
barrier
it
had
a
defect
it
was
too
low
the
surge
could
not
destroy
but
could
sweep
over
it
it
was
useless
to
think
of
building
it
higher
nothing
but
masses
of
rock
could
avail
upon
a
barrier
of
stone
but
how
could
such
masses
be
detached
or
if
detached
how
could
they
be
moved
or
raised
or
piled
or
fixed
timbers
may
be
added
but
rocks
can
not
gilliatt
was
not
enceladus
the
very
little
height
of
this
rocky
isthmus
rendered
him
anxious
the
effects
of
this
fault
were
not
long
in
showing
themselves
the
assaults
upon
the
breakwater
were
incessant
the
heavy
seas
seemed
not
merely
to
rage
but
to
attack
with
determination
to
destroy
it
a
sort
of
trampling
noise
was
heard
upon
the
jolted
framework
suddenly
the
end
of
a
binding
strake
detached
from
the
dislocated
frame
was
swept
away
over
the
second
barrier
and
across
the
transversal
rock
falling
in
the
defile
where
the
water
seized
and
carried
it
into
the
sinuosities
of
the
pass
gilliatt
lost
sight
of
it
it
seemed
probable
that
it
would
do
some
injury
to
the
sloop
fortunately
the
water
in
the
interior
of
the
rocks
shut
in
on
all
sides
felt
little
of
the
commotion
without
the
waves
there
were
comparatively
trifling
and
the
shock
was
not
likely
to
be
very
severe
for
the
rest
he
had
little
time
to
spare
for
reflection
upon
this
mishap
every
variety
of
danger
was
arising
at
once
the
tempest
was
concentrated
upon
the
vulnerable
point
destruction
was
imminent
the
darkness
was
profound
for
a
moment
the
lightnings
paused
a
sort
of
sinister
connivance
the
cloud
and
the
sea
became
one
there
was
a
dull
peal
this
was
followed
by
a
terrible
outburst
the
frame
which
formed
the
front
of
the
barriers
was
swept
away
the
fragments
of
beams
were
visible
in
the
rolling
waters
the
sea
was
using
the
first
breakwater
as
an
engine
for
making
a
breach
in
the
second
gilliatt
experienced
the
feeling
of
a
general
who
sees
his
advanced
guard
driven
in
the
second
construction
of
beams
resisted
the
shock
the
apparatus
behind
it
was
powerfully
secured
and
buttressed
but
the
broken
frame
was
heavy
and
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
which
were
incessantly
hurling
it
forward
and
withdrawing
it
the
ropes
and
chains
which
remained
unsevered
prevented
its
entirely
breaking
up
and
the
qualities
which
gilliatt
had
given
it
as
a
means
of
defence
made
it
in
the
end
a
more
effective
weapon
of
destruction
instead
of
a
buckler
it
had
become
a
besides
this
it
was
now
full
of
irregularities
from
breaking
ends
of
timbers
projected
from
all
parts
and
it
was
as
it
were
covered
with
teeth
and
spikes
no
sort
of
arm
could
have
been
more
effective
or
more
fitted
for
the
handling
of
the
tempest
it
was
the
projectile
while
the
sea
played
the
part
of
the
catapult
the
blows
succeeded
each
other
with
a
dismal
regularity
gilliatt
thoughtful
and
anxious
behind
that
barricaded
portal
listened
to
the
sound
of
death
knocking
loudly
for
admittance
he
reflected
with
bitterness
that
but
for
the
fatal
entanglement
of
the
funnel
of
the
durande
in
the
wreck
he
would
have
been
at
that
very
moment
and
even
since
the
morning
once
more
at
guernsey
in
the
port
with
the
sloop
out
of
danger
and
with
the
machinery
saved
the
dreaded
moment
arrived
the
destruction
was
complete
there
was
a
sound
like
a
the
entire
frame
of
the
breakwater
the
double
apparatus
crushed
and
mingled
confusedly
came
in
a
whirl
of
foam
rushing
upon
the
stone
barricade
like
chaos
upon
a
mountain
where
it
stopped
here
the
fragments
lay
together
a
mass
of
beams
penetrable
by
the
waves
but
still
breaking
their
force
the
conquered
barrier
struggled
nobly
against
destruction
the
waves
had
shattered
it
and
in
their
turn
were
shattered
against
it
though
overthrown
it
still
remained
in
some
degree
effective
the
rock
which
barred
its
passage
an
immovable
obstacle
held
it
fast
the
defile
as
we
have
said
was
very
narrow
at
that
point
the
victorious
whirlwind
had
driven
forward
mingled
and
piled
up
the
wreck
of
the
breakwater
in
this
narrow
pass
the
very
violence
of
the
assault
by
heaping
up
the
mass
and
driving
the
broken
ends
one
into
the
other
had
contributed
to
make
the
pile
firm
it
was
destroyed
but
immovable
a
few
pieces
of
timber
only
were
swept
away
and
dispersed
by
the
waves
one
passed
through
the
air
very
near
to
gilliatt
he
felt
the
counter
current
upon
his
forehead
some
waves
however
of
that
kind
which
in
great
tempests
return
with
an
imperturbable
regularity
swept
over
the
ruins
of
the
breakwater
they
fell
into
the
defile
and
in
spite
of
the
many
angles
of
the
passage
set
the
waters
within
in
commotion
the
waters
began
to
roll
through
the
gorge
ominously
the
mysterious
embraces
of
the
waves
among
the
rocks
were
audible
what
means
were
there
of
preventing
this
agitation
extending
as
far
as
the
sloop
it
would
not
require
a
long
time
for
the
blast
of
wind
to
create
a
tempest
through
all
the
windings
of
the
pass
a
few
heavy
seas
would
be
sufficient
to
stave
in
the
sloop
and
scatter
her
burden
gilliatt
shuddered
as
he
reflected
but
he
was
not
disconcerted
no
defeat
could
daunt
his
soul
the
hurricane
had
now
discovered
the
true
plan
of
attack
and
was
rushing
fiercely
between
the
two
walls
of
the
strait
suddenly
a
crash
was
heard
resounding
and
prolonging
itself
through
the
defile
at
some
distance
behind
him
a
crash
more
terrible
than
any
he
had
yet
heard
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
sloop
something
disastrous
was
happening
there
gilliatt
hastened
towards
it
from
the
eastern
gullet
where
he
was
he
could
not
see
the
sloop
on
account
of
the
sharp
turns
of
the
pass
at
the
last
turn
he
stopped
and
waited
for
the
lightning
the
first
flash
revealed
to
him
the
position
of
affairs
the
rush
of
the
sea
through
the
eastern
entrance
had
been
met
by
a
blast
of
wind
from
the
other
end
a
disaster
was
near
at
hand
the
sloop
had
received
no
visible
damage
anchored
as
she
was
the
storm
had
little
power
over
her
but
the
carcase
of
the
durande
was
distressed
in
such
a
tempest
the
wreck
presented
a
considerable
surface
it
was
entirely
out
of
the
sea
in
the
air
exposed
the
breach
which
gilliatt
had
made
and
which
he
had
passed
the
engine
through
had
rendered
the
hull
still
weaker
the
keelson
was
snapped
the
vertebral
column
of
the
skeleton
was
broken
the
hurricane
had
passed
over
it
scarcely
more
than
this
was
needed
to
complete
its
destruction
the
planking
of
the
deck
had
bent
like
an
opened
book
the
dismemberment
had
begun
it
was
the
noise
of
this
dislocation
which
had
reached
gilliatt
ears
in
the
midst
of
the
tempest
the
disaster
which
presented
itself
as
he
approached
appeared
almost
irremediable
the
square
opening
which
he
had
cut
in
the
keel
had
become
a
gaping
wound
the
wind
had
converted
the
hole
into
a
ragged
fracture
this
transverse
breach
separated
the
wreck
in
two
the
nearest
to
the
sloop
had
remained
firm
in
its
bed
of
rocks
the
forward
portion
which
faced
him
was
hanging
a
fracture
while
it
holds
is
a
sort
of
hinge
the
whole
mass
oscillated
as
the
wind
moved
it
with
a
doleful
noise
fortunately
the
sloop
was
no
longer
beneath
it
but
this
swinging
movement
shook
the
other
portion
of
the
hull
still
wedged
and
immovable
as
it
was
between
the
two
douvres
from
shaking
to
casting
down
the
distance
is
not
far
under
the
obstinate
assaults
of
the
gale
the
dislocated
part
might
suddenly
carry
away
the
other
portion
which
almost
touched
the
sloop
in
this
case
the
whole
wreck
together
with
the
sloop
and
the
engine
must
be
swept
into
the
sea
and
swallowed
up
all
this
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
it
was
the
end
of
all
how
could
it
be
prevented
gilliatt
was
one
of
those
who
are
accustomed
to
snatch
the
means
of
safety
out
of
danger
itself
he
collected
his
ideas
for
a
moment
then
he
hastened
to
his
arsenal
and
brought
his
hatchet
the
mallet
had
served
him
well
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
axe
he
mounted
upon
the
wreck
got
a
footing
on
that
part
of
the
planking
which
had
not
given
way
and
leaning
over
the
precipice
of
the
pass
between
the
douvres
he
began
to
cut
away
the
broken
joists
and
the
planking
which
supported
the
hanging
portion
of
the
hull
his
object
was
to
effect
the
separation
of
the
two
parts
of
the
wreck
to
disencumber
the
half
which
remained
firm
to
throw
overboard
what
the
waves
had
seized
and
thus
share
the
prey
with
the
storm
the
hanging
portion
of
the
wreck
borne
down
by
the
wind
and
by
its
own
weight
adhered
only
at
one
or
two
points
the
entire
wreck
resembled
a
one
leaf
of
which
beat
against
the
other
five
or
six
pieces
of
the
planking
only
bent
and
started
but
not
broken
still
held
their
fractures
creaked
and
enlarged
at
every
gust
and
the
axe
so
to
speak
had
but
to
help
the
labour
of
the
wind
this
more
than
condition
while
it
increased
the
facility
of
the
work
also
rendered
it
dangerous
the
whole
might
give
way
beneath
him
at
any
moment
the
tempest
had
reached
its
highest
point
the
convulsion
of
the
sea
reached
the
heavens
hitherto
the
storm
had
been
supreme
it
had
seemed
to
work
its
own
imperious
will
to
give
the
impulse
to
drive
the
waves
to
frenzy
while
still
preserving
a
sort
of
sinister
lucidity
below
was
fury
above
anger
the
heavens
are
the
breath
the
ocean
only
foam
hence
the
authority
of
the
wind
but
the
intoxication
of
its
own
horrors
had
confused
it
it
had
become
a
mere
whirlwind
it
was
a
blindness
leading
to
night
there
are
times
when
tempests
become
frenzied
when
the
heavens
are
attacked
with
a
sort
of
delirium
when
the
firmament
raves
and
hurls
its
lightnings
blindly
no
terror
is
greater
than
this
it
is
a
hideous
moment
the
trembling
of
the
rock
was
at
its
height
every
storm
has
a
mysterious
course
but
now
it
loses
its
appointed
path
it
is
the
most
dangerous
point
of
the
tempest
at
that
moment
says
thomas
fuller
the
wind
is
a
furious
maniac
it
is
at
that
instant
that
that
continuous
discharge
of
electricity
takes
place
which
piddington
calls
the
cascade
of
lightnings
it
is
at
that
instant
that
in
the
blackest
spot
of
the
clouds
none
know
why
unless
it
be
to
spy
the
universal
terror
a
circle
of
blue
light
appears
which
the
spanish
sailors
of
ancient
times
called
the
eye
of
the
tempest
ojo
de
la
that
terrible
eye
looked
down
upon
gilliatt
gilliatt
on
his
part
was
surveying
the
heavens
he
raised
his
head
now
after
every
stroke
of
his
hatchet
he
stood
erect
and
gazed
upwards
almost
haughtily
he
was
or
seemed
to
be
too
near
destruction
not
to
feel
would
he
despair
no
in
the
presence
of
the
wildest
fury
of
the
ocean
he
was
watchful
as
well
as
bold
he
planted
his
feet
only
where
the
wreck
was
firm
he
ventured
his
life
and
yet
was
careful
for
his
determined
spirit
too
had
reached
its
highest
point
his
strength
had
grown
tenfold
greater
he
had
become
heated
with
his
own
intrepidity
the
strokes
of
his
hatchet
were
like
blows
of
defiance
he
seemed
to
have
gained
in
directness
what
the
tempest
had
lost
a
pathetic
struggle
on
the
one
hand
an
indefatigable
will
on
the
other
inexhaustible
power
it
was
a
contest
with
the
elements
for
the
prize
at
his
feet
the
clouds
took
the
shape
of
gorgon
masks
in
the
immensity
of
the
heavens
every
possible
form
of
terror
appeared
the
rain
came
from
the
sea
the
surf
from
the
cloud
phantoms
of
the
wind
bent
down
meteoric
faces
revealed
themselves
and
were
again
eclipsed
leaving
the
darkness
more
monstrous
then
there
was
nothing
seen
but
the
torrents
coming
from
all
sides
a
boiling
sea
cumuli
heavy
with
hail
appeared
seized
with
a
sort
of
whirling
frenzy
strange
rattlings
filled
the
air
the
inverse
currents
of
electricity
observed
by
volta
darted
their
sudden
flashes
from
cloud
to
cloud
the
prolongation
of
the
lightnings
was
terrible
the
flashes
passed
near
to
gilliatt
the
very
ocean
seemed
astonished
he
passed
to
and
fro
upon
the
tottering
wreck
making
the
deck
tremble
under
his
steps
striking
cutting
hacking
with
the
hatchet
in
his
hand
pallid
in
the
gleam
of
the
lightning
his
long
hair
streaming
his
feet
naked
in
rags
his
face
covered
with
the
foam
of
the
sea
but
grand
still
amid
that
maelstrom
of
the
thunderstorm
against
these
furious
powers
man
has
no
weapon
but
his
invention
invention
was
gilliatt
triumph
his
object
was
to
allow
all
the
dislocated
portions
of
the
wreck
to
fall
together
for
this
reason
he
cut
away
the
broken
portions
without
entirely
separating
them
leaving
some
parts
on
which
they
still
swung
suddenly
he
stopped
holding
his
axe
in
the
air
the
operation
was
complete
the
entire
portion
went
with
a
crash
the
mass
rolled
down
between
the
two
douvres
just
below
gilliatt
who
stood
upon
the
wreck
leaning
over
and
observing
the
fall
it
fell
perpendicularly
into
the
water
struck
the
rocks
and
stopped
in
the
defile
before
touching
the
bottom
enough
remained
out
of
the
water
to
rise
more
than
twelve
feet
above
the
waves
the
vertical
mass
of
planking
formed
a
wall
between
the
two
douvres
like
the
rock
overturned
crosswise
higher
up
the
defile
it
allowed
only
a
slight
stream
of
foam
to
pass
through
at
its
two
extremities
and
thus
was
a
fifth
barricade
improvised
by
gilliatt
against
the
tempest
in
that
passage
of
the
seas
the
hurricane
itself
in
its
blind
fury
had
assisted
in
the
construction
of
this
last
barrier
it
was
fortunate
that
the
proximity
of
the
two
walls
had
prevented
the
mass
of
wreck
from
falling
to
the
bottom
this
circumstance
gave
the
barricade
greater
height
the
water
besides
could
flow
under
the
obstacle
which
diminished
the
power
of
the
waves
that
which
passes
below
can
not
pass
over
this
is
partly
the
secret
of
the
floating
breakwater
henceforth
let
the
storm
do
what
it
might
there
was
nothing
to
fear
for
the
sloop
or
the
machinery
the
water
around
them
could
not
become
agitated
again
between
the
barrier
of
the
douvres
which
covered
them
on
the
west
and
the
barricade
which
protected
them
from
the
east
no
heavy
sea
or
wind
could
reach
them
gilliatt
had
plucked
safety
out
of
the
catastrophe
itself
the
storm
had
been
his
in
the
work
this
done
he
took
a
little
water
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
from
one
of
the
and
drank
and
then
looking
upward
at
the
storm
said
with
a
smile
bungler
human
intelligence
combating
with
brute
force
experiences
an
ironical
joy
in
demonstrating
the
stupidity
of
its
antagonist
and
compelling
it
to
serve
the
very
objects
of
its
fury
and
gilliatt
felt
something
of
that
immemorial
desire
to
insult
his
invisible
enemy
which
is
as
old
as
the
heroes
of
the
he
descended
to
the
sloop
and
examined
it
by
the
gleam
of
the
lightning
the
relief
which
he
had
been
able
to
give
to
his
distressed
bark
was
she
had
been
much
shaken
during
the
last
hour
and
had
begun
to
give
way
a
hasty
glance
revealed
no
serious
injury
nevertheless
he
was
certain
that
the
vessel
had
been
subjected
to
violent
shocks
as
soon
as
the
waves
had
subsided
the
hull
had
righted
itself
the
anchors
had
held
fast
as
to
the
machine
the
four
chains
had
supported
it
admirably
while
gilliatt
was
completing
this
survey
something
white
passed
before
his
eyes
and
vanished
in
the
gloom
it
was
a
no
sight
could
be
more
welcome
in
tempestuous
weather
when
the
birds
reappear
the
storm
is
departing
the
thunder
redoubled
another
good
sign
the
violent
efforts
of
the
storm
had
broken
its
force
all
mariners
know
that
the
last
ordeal
is
severe
but
short
the
excessive
violence
of
the
thunderstorm
is
the
herald
of
the
end
the
rain
stopped
suddenly
then
there
was
only
a
surly
rumbling
in
the
heavens
the
storm
ceased
with
the
suddenness
of
a
plank
falling
to
the
ground
the
immense
mass
of
clouds
became
disorganised
a
strip
of
clear
sky
appeared
between
them
gilliatt
was
astonished
it
was
broad
daylight
the
tempest
had
lasted
nearly
twenty
hours
the
wind
which
had
brought
the
storm
carried
it
away
a
dark
pile
was
diffused
over
the
horizon
the
broken
clouds
were
flying
in
confusion
across
the
sky
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
line
there
was
a
movement
of
retreat
a
long
muttering
was
heard
gradually
decreasing
a
few
last
drops
of
rain
fell
and
all
those
dark
masses
charged
with
thunder
departed
like
a
terrible
multitude
of
chariots
suddenly
the
wide
expanse
of
sky
became
blue
gilliatt
perceived
that
he
was
wearied
sleep
swoops
down
upon
the
exhausted
frame
like
a
bird
upon
its
prey
he
drooped
and
sank
upon
the
deck
of
the
bark
without
choosing
his
position
and
there
slept
stretched
at
length
and
inert
he
remained
thus
for
some
hours
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
beams
and
joists
among
which
he
lay
book
iv
pitfalls
in
the
way
i
he
who
is
hungry
is
not
alone
when
he
awakened
he
was
hungry
the
sea
was
growing
calmer
but
there
was
still
a
heavy
swell
which
made
his
departure
for
the
present
at
least
impossible
the
day
too
was
far
advanced
for
the
sloop
with
its
burden
to
get
to
guernsey
before
midnight
it
was
necessary
to
start
in
the
morning
although
pressed
by
hunger
gilliatt
began
by
stripping
himself
the
only
means
of
getting
warmth
his
clothing
was
saturated
by
the
storm
but
the
rain
had
washed
out
the
which
rendered
it
possible
to
dry
them
he
kept
nothing
on
but
his
trousers
which
he
turned
up
nearly
to
the
knees
his
overcoat
jacket
overalls
and
sheepskin
he
spread
out
and
fixed
with
large
round
stones
here
and
there
then
he
thought
of
eating
he
had
recourse
to
his
knife
which
he
was
careful
to
sharpen
and
to
keep
always
in
good
condition
and
he
detached
from
the
rocks
a
few
limpets
similar
in
kind
to
the
of
the
mediterranean
it
is
well
known
that
these
are
eaten
raw
but
after
so
many
labours
so
various
and
so
rude
the
pittance
was
meagre
his
biscuit
was
gone
but
of
water
he
had
now
abundance
he
took
advantage
of
the
receding
tide
to
wander
among
the
rocks
in
search
of
crayfish
there
was
extent
enough
of
rock
to
hope
for
a
successful
search
but
he
had
not
reflected
that
he
could
do
nothing
with
these
without
fire
to
cook
them
if
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
go
to
his
he
would
have
found
it
inundated
with
the
rain
his
wood
and
coal
were
drowned
and
of
his
store
of
tow
which
served
him
for
tinder
there
was
not
a
fibre
which
was
not
saturated
no
means
remained
of
lighting
a
fire
for
the
rest
his
blower
was
completely
disorganised
the
screen
of
the
hearth
of
his
forge
was
broken
down
the
storm
had
sacked
and
devastated
his
workshop
with
what
tools
and
apparatus
had
escaped
the
general
wreck
he
could
still
have
done
carpentry
work
but
he
could
not
have
accomplished
any
of
the
labours
of
the
smith
gilliatt
however
never
thought
of
his
workshop
for
a
moment
drawn
in
another
direction
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
he
had
pursued
without
much
reflection
his
search
for
food
he
wandered
not
in
the
gorge
of
the
rocks
but
outside
among
the
smaller
breakers
it
was
there
that
the
durande
ten
weeks
previously
had
first
struck
upon
the
sunken
reef
for
the
search
that
gilliatt
was
prosecuting
this
part
was
more
favourable
than
the
interior
at
low
water
the
crabs
are
accustomed
to
crawl
out
into
the
air
they
seem
to
like
to
warm
themselves
in
the
sun
where
they
swarm
sometimes
to
the
disgust
of
loiterers
who
recognise
in
these
creatures
with
their
awkward
sidelong
gait
climbing
clumsily
from
crack
to
crack
the
lower
stages
of
the
rocks
like
the
steps
of
a
staircase
a
sort
of
sea
vermin
for
two
months
gilliatt
had
lived
upon
these
vermin
of
the
sea
on
this
day
however
the
crayfish
and
crabs
were
both
wanting
the
tempest
had
driven
them
into
their
solitary
retreats
and
they
had
not
yet
mustered
courage
to
venture
abroad
gilliatt
held
his
open
knife
in
his
hand
and
from
time
to
time
scraped
a
cockle
from
under
the
bunches
of
seaweed
which
he
ate
while
still
walking
he
could
not
have
been
far
from
the
very
spot
where
sieur
clubin
had
perished
as
gilliatt
was
determining
to
content
himself
with
the
and
the
de
a
little
clattering
noise
at
his
feet
aroused
his
attention
a
large
crab
startled
by
his
approach
had
just
dropped
into
a
pool
the
water
was
shallow
and
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
it
he
chased
the
crab
along
the
base
of
the
rock
the
crab
moved
fast
suddenly
it
was
gone
it
had
buried
itself
in
some
crevice
under
the
rock
gilliatt
clutched
the
projections
of
the
rock
and
stretched
out
to
observe
where
it
shelved
away
under
the
water
as
he
suspected
there
was
an
opening
there
in
which
the
creature
had
evidently
taken
refuge
it
was
more
than
a
crevice
it
was
a
kind
of
porch
the
sea
entered
beneath
it
but
was
not
deep
the
bottom
was
visible
covered
with
large
pebbles
the
pebbles
were
green
and
clothed
with
indicating
that
they
were
never
dry
they
were
like
the
tops
of
a
number
of
heads
of
infants
covered
with
a
kind
of
green
hair
holding
his
knife
between
his
teeth
gilliatt
descended
by
the
help
of
feet
and
hands
from
the
upper
part
of
the
escarpment
and
leaped
into
the
water
it
reached
almost
to
his
shoulders
he
made
his
way
through
the
porch
and
found
himself
in
a
blind
passage
with
a
roof
in
the
form
of
a
rude
arch
over
his
head
the
walls
were
polished
and
slippery
the
crab
was
nowhere
visible
he
gained
his
feet
and
advanced
in
daylight
growing
fainter
so
that
he
began
to
lose
the
power
to
distinguish
objects
at
about
fifteen
paces
the
vaulted
roof
ended
overhead
he
had
penetrated
beyond
the
blind
passage
there
was
here
more
space
and
consequently
more
daylight
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
moreover
had
dilated
he
could
see
pretty
clearly
he
was
taken
by
surprise
he
had
made
his
way
again
into
the
singular
cavern
which
he
had
visited
in
the
previous
month
the
only
difference
was
that
he
had
entered
by
the
way
of
the
sea
it
was
through
the
submarine
arch
that
he
had
remarked
before
that
he
had
just
entered
at
certain
low
tides
it
was
accessible
his
eyes
became
more
accustomed
to
the
place
his
vision
became
clearer
and
clearer
he
was
astonished
he
found
himself
again
in
that
extraordinary
palace
of
shadows
saw
again
before
his
eyes
that
vaulted
roof
those
columns
those
purple
and
stains
that
vegetation
rich
with
gems
and
at
the
farther
end
that
crypt
or
sanctuary
and
that
stone
he
took
little
notice
of
these
details
but
their
impression
was
in
his
mind
and
he
saw
that
the
place
was
unchanged
he
observed
before
him
at
a
certain
height
in
the
wall
the
crevice
through
which
he
had
penetrated
the
first
time
and
which
from
the
point
where
he
now
stood
appeared
inaccessible
near
the
moulded
arch
he
remarked
those
low
dark
grottoes
a
sort
of
caves
within
a
cavern
which
he
had
already
observed
from
a
distance
he
now
stood
nearer
to
them
the
entrance
to
the
nearest
to
him
was
out
of
the
water
and
easily
approachable
nearer
still
than
this
recess
he
noticed
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
within
reach
of
his
hand
a
horizontal
fissure
it
seemed
to
him
probable
that
the
crab
had
taken
refuge
there
and
he
plunged
his
hand
in
as
far
as
he
was
able
and
groped
about
in
that
dusky
aperture
suddenly
he
felt
himself
seized
by
the
arm
a
strange
indescribable
horror
thrilled
through
him
some
living
thing
thin
rough
flat
cold
slimy
had
twisted
itself
round
his
naked
arm
in
the
dark
depth
below
it
crept
upward
towards
his
chest
its
pressure
was
like
a
tightening
cord
its
steady
persistence
like
that
of
a
screw
in
less
than
a
moment
some
mysterious
spiral
form
had
passed
round
his
wrist
and
elbow
and
had
reached
his
shoulder
a
sharp
point
penetrated
beneath
the
armpit
gilliatt
recoiled
but
he
had
scarcely
power
to
move
he
was
as
it
were
nailed
to
the
place
with
his
left
hand
which
was
disengaged
he
seized
his
knife
which
he
still
held
between
his
teeth
and
with
that
hand
holding
the
knife
he
supported
himself
against
the
rocks
while
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
withdraw
his
arm
he
succeeded
only
in
disturbing
his
persecutor
which
wound
itself
still
tighter
it
was
supple
as
leather
strong
as
steel
cold
as
night
a
second
form
sharp
elongated
and
narrow
issued
out
of
the
crevice
like
a
tongue
out
of
monstrous
jaws
it
seemed
to
lick
his
naked
body
then
suddenly
stretching
out
it
became
longer
and
thinner
as
it
crept
over
his
skin
and
wound
itself
round
him
at
the
same
time
a
terrible
sense
of
pain
comparable
to
nothing
he
had
ever
known
compelled
all
his
muscles
to
contract
he
felt
upon
his
skin
a
number
of
flat
rounded
points
it
seemed
as
if
innumerable
suckers
had
fastened
to
his
flesh
and
were
about
to
drink
his
blood
a
third
long
undulating
shape
issued
from
the
hole
in
the
rock
seemed
to
feel
its
way
about
his
body
lashed
round
his
ribs
like
a
cord
and
fixed
itself
there
agony
when
at
its
height
is
mute
gilliatt
uttered
no
cry
there
was
sufficient
light
for
him
to
see
the
repulsive
forms
which
had
entangled
themselves
about
him
a
fourth
ligature
but
this
one
swift
as
an
arrow
darted
towards
his
stomach
and
wound
around
him
there
it
was
impossible
to
sever
or
tear
away
the
slimy
bands
which
were
twisted
tightly
round
his
body
and
were
adhering
by
a
number
of
points
each
of
the
points
was
the
focus
of
frightful
and
singular
pangs
it
was
as
if
numberless
small
mouths
were
devouring
him
at
the
same
time
a
fifth
long
slimy
strip
issued
from
the
hole
it
passed
over
the
others
and
wound
itself
tightly
around
his
chest
the
compression
increased
his
sufferings
he
could
scarcely
breathe
these
living
thongs
were
pointed
at
their
extremities
but
broadened
like
a
blade
of
a
sword
towards
its
hilt
all
belonged
evidently
to
the
same
centre
they
crept
and
glided
about
him
he
felt
the
strange
points
of
pressure
which
seemed
to
him
like
mouths
change
their
places
from
time
to
time
suddenly
a
large
round
flattened
glutinous
mass
issued
from
beneath
the
crevice
it
was
the
centre
the
five
thongs
were
attached
to
it
like
spokes
to
the
nave
of
a
wheel
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
disgusting
monster
appeared
the
commencement
of
three
other
tentacles
the
ends
of
which
remained
under
the
rock
in
the
middle
of
this
slimy
mass
appeared
two
eyes
the
eyes
were
fixed
on
gilliatt
he
recognised
the
ii
the
monster
it
is
difficult
for
those
who
have
not
seen
it
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
compared
to
this
creature
the
ancient
hydras
are
insignificant
at
times
we
are
tempted
to
imagine
that
the
vague
forms
which
float
in
our
dreams
may
encounter
in
the
realm
of
the
possible
attractive
forces
having
power
to
fix
their
lineaments
and
shape
living
beings
out
of
these
creatures
of
our
slumbers
the
unknown
has
power
over
these
strange
visions
and
out
of
them
composes
monsters
orpheus
homer
and
hesiod
imagined
only
the
chimera
providence
has
created
this
terrible
creature
of
the
sea
creation
abounds
in
monstrous
forms
of
life
the
wherefore
of
this
perplexes
and
affrights
the
religious
thinker
if
terror
were
the
object
of
its
creation
nothing
could
be
imagined
more
perfect
than
the
the

enormous

yet
he
is
of

the
most
formidably
armed
what
then
is
the
it
is
the
sea
vampire
the
swimmer
who
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
spot
ventures
among
breakers
in
the
open
sea
where
the
still
waters
hide
the
splendours
of
the
deep
or
in
the
hollows
of
unfrequented
rocks
in
unknown
caverns
abounding
in
sea
plants
testacea
and
crustacea
under
the
deep
portals
of
the
ocean
runs
the
risk
of
meeting
it
if
that
fate
should
be
yours
be
not
curious
but
fly
the
intruder
enters
there
dazzled
but
quits
the
spot
in
terror
this
frightful
apparition
which
is
always
possible
among
the
rocks
in
the
open
sea
is
a
greyish
form
which
undulates
in
the
water
it
is
of
the
thickness
of
a
man
arm
and
in
length
nearly
five
feet
its
outline
is
ragged
its
form
resembles
an
umbrella
closed
and
without
handle
this
irregular
mass
advances
slowly
towards
you
suddenly
it
opens
and
eight
radii
issue
abruptly
from
around
a
face
with
two
eyes
these
radii
are
alive
their
undulation
is
like
lambent
flames
they
resemble
when
opened
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
of
four
or
five
feet
in
diameter
a
terrible
expansion
it
springs
upon
its
prey
the
harpoons
its
victim
it
winds
around
the
sufferer
covering
and
entangling
him
in
its
long
folds
underneath
it
is
yellow
above
a
dull
earthy
hue
nothing
could
render
that
inexplicable
shade
dust
coloured
its
form
is
but
its
tints
are
like
those
of
the
chamelion
when
irritated
it
becomes
violet
its
most
horrible
characteristic
is
its
softness
its
folds
strangle
its
contact
paralyses
it
has
an
aspect
like
gangrened
or
scabrous
flesh
it
is
a
monstrous
embodiment
of
disease
it
adheres
closely
to
its
prey
and
can
not
be
torn
away
a
fact
which
is
due
to
its
power
of
exhausting
air
the
eight
antennæ
large
at
their
roots
diminish
gradually
and
end
in
points
underneath
each
of
these
feelers
range
two
rows
of
pustules
decreasing
in
size
the
largest
ones
near
the
head
the
smaller
at
the
extremities
each
row
contains
of
these
there
are
therefore
fifty
pustules
to
each
feeler
and
the
creature
possesses
in
the
whole
four
hundred
these
pustules
are
capable
of
acting
like
they
are
cartilaginous
substances
cylindrical
horny
and
livid
upon
the
large
species
they
diminish
gradually
from
the
diameter
of
a
piece
to
the
size
of
a
split
pea
these
small
tubes
can
be
thrust
out
and
withdrawn
by
the
animal
at
will
they
are
capable
of
piercing
to
a
depth
of
more
than
an
inch
this
sucking
apparatus
has
all
the
regularity
and
delicacy
of
a
it
stands
forth
at
one
moment
and
disappears
the
next
the
most
perfect
sensitiveness
can
not
equal
the
contractibility
of
these
suckers
always
proportioned
to
the
internal
movement
of
the
animal
and
its
exterior
circumstances
the
monster
is
endowed
with
the
qualities
of
the
sensitive
plant
this
animal
is
the
same
as
those
which
mariners
call
poulps
which
science
designates
cephalopteræ
and
which
ancient
legends
call
krakens
it
is
the
english
sailors
who
call
them
and
sometimes
bloodsuckers
in
the
channel
islands
they
are
called
they
are
rare
at
guernsey
very
small
at
jersey
but
near
the
island
of
sark
are
numerous
as
well
as
very
large
an
engraving
in
sonnini
edition
of

represents
a
cephaloptera
crushing
a
frigate
denis
montfort
in
fact
considers
the
poulp
or
octopod
of
high
latitudes
strong
enough
to
destroy
a
ship
bory
saint
vincent
doubts
this
but
he
shows
that
in
our
regions
they
will
attack
men
near
in
sark
they
show
a
cave
where
a
a
few
years
since
seized
and
drowned
a
peron
and
lamarck
are
in
error
in
their
belief
that
the
poulp
having
no
fins
can
not
swim
he
who
writes
these
lines
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
at
sark
in
the
cavern
called
the
boutiques
a
pieuvre
swimming
and
pursuing
a
bather
when
captured
and
killed
this
specimen
was
found
to
be
four
english
feet
broad
and
it
was
possible
to
count
its
four
hundred
suckers
the
monster
thrust
them
out
convulsively
in
the
agony
of
death
according
to
denis
montfort
one
of
those
observers
whose
marvellous
intuition
sinks
or
raises
them
to
the
level
of
magicians
the
poulp
is
almost
endowed
with
the
passions
of
man
it
has
its
hatreds
in
fact
in
the
absolute
to
be
hideous
is
to
hate
hideousness
struggles
under
the
natural
law
of
elimination
which
necessarily
renders
it
hostile
when
swimming
the
rests
so
to
speak
in
its
sheath
it
swims
with
all
its
parts
drawn
close
it
may
be
likened
to
a
sleeve
sewn
up
with
a
closed
fist
within
the
protuberance
which
is
the
head
pushes
the
water
aside
and
advances
with
a
vague
undulatory
movement
its
two
eyes
though
large
are
indistinct
being
of
the
colour
of
the
water
when
in
ambush
or
seeking
its
prey
it
retires
into
itself
grows
smaller
and
condenses
itself
it
is
then
scarcely
distinguishable
in
the
submarine
twilight
at
such
times
it
looks
like
a
mere
ripple
in
the
water
it
resembles
anything
except
a
living
creature
the
is
crafty
when
its
victim
is
unsuspicious
it
opens
suddenly
a
glutinous
mass
endowed
with
a
malignant
will
what
can
be
more
horrible
it
is
in
the
most
beautiful
azure
depths
of
the
limpid
water
that
this
hideous
voracious
polyp
delights
it
always
conceals
itself
a
fact
which
increases
its
terrible
associations
when
they
are
seen
it
is
almost
invariably
after
they
have
been
captured
at
night
however
and
particularly
in
the
hot
season
it
becomes
phosphorescent
these
horrible
creatures
have
their
passions
their
submarine
nuptials
then
it
adorns
itself
burns
and
illumines
and
from
the
height
of
some
rock
it
may
be
seen
in
the
deep
obscurity
of
the
waves
below
expanding
with
a
pale
irradiation
a
spectral
sun
the
not
only
swims
it
walks
it
is
partly
fish
partly
reptile
it
crawls
upon
the
bed
of
the
sea
at
these
times
it
makes
use
of
its
eight
feelers
and
creeps
along
in
the
fashion
of
a
species
of
caterpillar
it
has
no
blood
no
bones
no
flesh
it
is
soft
and
flabby
a
skin
with
nothing
inside
its
eight
tentacles
may
be
turned
inside
out
like
the
fingers
of
a
glove
it
has
a
single
orifice
in
the
centre
of
its
radii
which
appears
at
first
to
be
neither
the
vent
nor
the
mouth
it
is
in
fact
both
one
and
the
other
the
orifice
performs
a
double
function
the
entire
creature
is
cold
the
of
the
mediterranean
is
repulsive
contact
with
that
animated
gelatinous
substance
which
envelopes
the
bather
in
which
the
hands
sink
and
the
nails
scratch
ineffectively
which
can
be
torn
without
killing
it
and
which
can
be
plucked
off
without
entirely
removing
it
that
fluid
and
yet
tenacious
creature
which
slips
through
the
fingers
is
disgusting
but
no
horror
can
equal
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
that
medusa
with
its
eight
serpents
no
grasp
is
like
the
sudden
strain
of
the
cephaloptera
it
is
with
the
sucking
apparatus
that
it
attacks
the
victim
is
oppressed
by
a
vacuum
drawing
at
numberless
points
it
is
not
a
clawing
or
a
biting
but
an
indescribable
scarification
a
tearing
of
the
flesh
is
terrible
but
less
terrible
than
a
sucking
of
the
blood
claws
are
harmless
compared
with
the
horrible
action
of
these
natural
the
talons
of
the
wild
beast
enter
into
your
flesh
but
with
the
cephaloptera
it
is
you
who
enter
into
the
creature
the
muscles
swell
the
fibres
of
the
body
are
contorted
the
skin
cracks
under
the
loathsome
oppression
the
blood
spurts
out
and
mingles
horribly
with
the
lymph
of
the
monster
which
clings
to
its
victim
by
innumerable
hideous
mouths
the
hydra
incorporates
itself
with
the
man
the
man
becomes
one
with
the
hydra
the
spectre
lies
upon
you
the
tiger
can
only
devour
you
the
horrible
sucks
your
away
he
draws
you
to
him
and
into
himself
while
bound
down
glued
to
the
ground
powerless
you
feel
yourself
gradually
emptied
into
this
horrible
pouch
which
is
the
monster
itself
these
strange
animals
science
in
accordance
with
its
habit
of
excessive
caution
even
in
the
face
of
facts
at
first
rejects
as
fabulous
then
she
decides
to
observe
them
then
she
dissects
classifies
catalogues
and
labels
then
procures
specimens
and
exhibits
them
in
glass
cases
in
museums
they
enter
then
into
her
nomenclature
are
designated
mollusks
invertebrata
radiata
she
determines
their
position
in
the
animal
world
a
little
above
the
calamaries
a
little
below
the
she
finds
for
these
hydras
of
the
sea
an
analogous
creature
in
fresh
water
called
the
argyronecte
she
divides
them
into
great
medium
and
small
kinds
she
admits
more
readily
the
existence
of
the
small
than
of
the
large
species
which
is
however
the
tendency
of
science
in
all
countries
for
she
is
by
nature
more
microscopic
than
telescopic
she
regards
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
construction
and
calls
them
cephaloptera
counts
their
antennæ
and
calls
them
octopedes
this
done
she
leaves
them
where
science
drops
them
philosophy
takes
them
up
philosophy
in
her
turn
studies
these
creatures
she
goes
both
less
far
and
further
she
does
not
dissect
but
meditate
where
the
scalpel
has
laboured
she
plunges
the
hypothesis
she
seeks
the
final
cause
eternal
perplexity
of
the
thinker
these
creatures
disturb
his
ideas
of
the
creator
they
are
hideous
surprises
they
are
the
at
the
feast
of
contemplation
the
philosopher
determines
their
characteristics
in
dread
they
are
the
concrete
forms
of
evil
what
attitude
can
he
take
towards
this
treason
of
creation
against
herself
to
whom
can
he
look
for
the
solution
of
these
riddles
the
possible
is
a
terrible
matrix
monsters
are
mysteries
in
their
concrete
form
portions
of
shade
issue
from
the
mass
and
something
within
detaches
itself
rolls
floats
condenses
borrows
elements
from
the
ambient
darkness
becomes
subject
to
unknown
polarisations
assumes
a
kind
of
life
furnishes
itself
with
some
unimagined
form
from
the
obscurity
and
with
some
terrible
spirit
from
the
miasma
and
wanders
ghostlike
among
living
things
it
is
as
if
night
itself
assumed
the
forms
of
animals
but
for
what
good
with
what
object
thus
we
come
again
to
the
eternal
questioning
these
animals
are
indeed
phantoms
as
much
as
monsters
they
are
proved
and
yet
improbable
their
fate
is
to
exist
in
spite
of
reasonings
they
are
the
amphibia
of
the
shore
which
separates
life
from
death
their
unreality
makes
their
existence
puzzling
they
touch
the
frontier
of
man
domain
and
people
the
region
of
chimeras
we
deny
the
possibility
of
the
vampire
and
the
cephaloptera
appears
their
swarming
is
a
certainty
which
disconcerts
our
confidence
optimism
which
is
nevertheless
in
the
right
becomes
silenced
in
their
presence
they
form
the
visible
extremity
of
the
dark
circles
they
mark
the
transition
of
our
reality
into
another
they
seem
to
belong
to
that
commencement
of
terrible
life
which
the
dreamer
sees
confusedly
through
the
loophole
of
the
night
that
multiplication
of
monsters
first
in
the
invisible
then
in
the
possible
has
been
suspected
perhaps
perceived
by
magi
and
philosophers
in
their
austere
ecstasies
and
profound
contemplations
hence
the
conjecture
of
a
material
hell
the
demon
is
simply
the
invisible
tiger
the
wild
beast
which
devours
souls
has
been
presented
to
the
eyes
of
human
beings
by
john
and
by
dante
in
his
vision
of
hell
if
in
truth
the
invisible
circles
of
creation
continue
indefinitely
if
after
one
there
is
yet
another
and
so
forth
in
illimitable
progression
if
that
chain
which
for
our
part
we
are
resolved
to
doubt
really
exist
the
cephaloptera
at
one
extremity
proves
satan
at
the
other
it
is
certain
that
the
wrongdoer
at
one
end
proves
the
existence
of
wrong
at
the
other
every
malignant
creature
like
every
perverted
intelligence
is
a
sphinx
a
terrible
sphinx
propounding
a
terrible
riddle
the
riddle
of
the
existence
of
evil
it
is
this
perfection
of
evil
which
has
sometimes
sufficed
to
incline
powerful
intellects
to
a
faith
in
the
duality
of
the
deity
towards
that
terrible
bifrons
of
the
manichæans
a

who

who
is

on

who
in
his
turn
is

a

all
nature
which
is
under
our
observation
is
thus
alternately
devouring
and
devoured
the
prey

on
each
other

however

are
also

and
therefore
optimists
in

view
of

that
mysterious
exact
thinker
who
was
opposed
to

as
in
later
times
geoffrey
hilaire
has
been
to
cuvier
was
struck
with
the
idea
of

his
notions
may
be
summed

thus
universal

the

all

such
is
the
terrible
law
from
which
not
even
man
himself
escapes
in
our
world

this
fatal
order
of
things
produces

you
ask
for

we
find
the
solution

this
the
solution
is
this
the
answer
to
our
questionings
and
if
so
why
not
some
different

of

thus
the
question
returns
let
us
live
be
it
so
but
let
us
endeavour
that
death
shall
be

let
us
aspire
to
an
existence
in
which
these
mysteries
shall
be
made
clear
let
us
follow

conscience
which
leads
us
thither
for
let
us
never

iii
another
kind
of
such
was
the
creature
in
whose
power
gilliatt
had
fallen
for
some
minutes
the
monster
was
the
inhabitant
of
the
grotto
the
terrible
genii
of
the
place
a
kind
of
sombre
demon
of
the
water
all
the
splendours
of
the
cavern
existed
for
it
alone
on
the
day
of
the
previous
month
when
gilliatt
had
first
penetrated
into
the
grotto
the
dark
outline
vaguely
perceived
by
him
in
the
ripples
of
the
secret
waters
was
this
monster
it
was
here
in
its
home
when
entering
for
the
second
time
into
the
cavern
in
pursuit
of
the
crab
he
had
observed
the
crevice
in
which
he
supposed
that
the
crab
had
taken
refuge
the
pieuvre
was
there
lying
in
wait
for
prey
is
it
possible
to
imagine
that
secret
ambush
no
bird
would
brood
no
egg
would
burst
to
life
no
flower
would
dare
to
open
no
breast
to
give
milk
no
heart
to
love
no
spirit
to
soar
under
the
influence
of
that
apparition
of
evil
watching
with
sinister
patience
in
the
dusk
gilliatt
had
thrust
his
arm
deep
into
the
opening
the
monster
had
snapped
at
it
it
held
him
fast
as
the
spider
holds
the
fly
he
was
in
the
water
up
to
his
belt
his
naked
feet
clutching
the
slippery
roundness
of
the
huge
stones
at
the
bottom
his
right
arm
bound
and
rendered
powerless
by
the
flat
coils
of
the
long
tentacles
of
the
creature
and
his
body
almost
hidden
under
the
folds
and
cross
folds
of
this
horrible
bandage
of
the
eight
arms
of
the
three
adhered
to
the
rock
while
five
encircled
gilliatt
in
this
way
clinging
to
the
granite
on
the
one
hand
and
with
the
other
to
its
human
prey
it
enchained
him
to
the
rock
two
hundred
and
fifty
suckers
were
upon
him
tormenting
him
with
agony
and
loathing
he
was
grasped
by
gigantic
hands
the
fingers
of
which
were
each
nearly
a
yard
long
and
furnished
inside
with
living
blisters
eating
into
the
flesh
as
we
have
said
it
is
impossible
to
tear
oneself
from
the
folds
of
the
the
attempt
ends
only
in
a
firmer
grasp
the
monster
clings
with
more
determined
force
its
effort
increases
with
that
of
its
victim
every
struggle
produces
a
tightening
of
its
ligatures
gilliatt
had
but
one
resource
his
knife
his
left
hand
only
was
free
but
the
reader
knows
with
what
power
he
could
use
it
it
might
have
been
said
that
he
had
two
right
hands
his
open
knife
was
in
his
hand
the
antenna
of
the
can
not
be
cut
it
is
a
leathery
substance
impossible
to
divide
with
the
knife
it
slips
under
the
edge
its
position
in
attack
also
is
such
that
to
cut
it
would
be
to
wound
the
victim
own
flesh
the
creature
is
formidable
but
there
is
a
way
of
resisting
it
the
fishermen
of
sark
know
this
as
does
any
one
who
has
seen
them
execute
certain
movements
in
the
sea
the
porpoises
know
it
also
they
have
a
way
of
biting
the
which
decapitates
it
hence
the
frequent
sight
on
the
sea
of
poulps
and
without
heads
the
cephaloptera
in
fact
is
only
vulnerable
through
the
head
gilliatt
was
not
ignorant
of
this
fact
he
had
never
seen
a
of
this
size
his
first
encounter
was
with
one
of
the
larger
species
another
would
have
been
powerless
with
terror
with
the
as
with
a
furious
bull
there
is
a
certain
moment
in
the
conflict
which
must
be
seized
it
is
the
instant
when
the
bull
lowers
the
neck
it
is
the
instant
when
the
advances
its
head
the
movement
is
rapid
he
who
loses
that
moment
is
destroyed
the
things
we
have
described
occupied
only
a
few
moments
gilliatt
however
felt
the
increasing
power
of
its
innumerable
suckers
the
monster
is
cunning
it
tries
first
to
stupefy
its
prey
it
seizes
and
then
pauses
awhile
gilliatt
grasped
his
knife
the
sucking
increased
he
looked
at
the
monster
which
seemed
to
look
at
him
suddenly
it
loosened
from
the
rock
its
sixth
antenna
and
darting
it
at
him
seized
him
by
the
left
arm
at
the
same
moment
it
advanced
its
head
with
a
violent
movement
in
one
second
more
its
mouth
would
have
fastened
on
his
breast
bleeding
in
the
sides
and
with
his
two
arms
entangled
he
would
have
been
a
dead
man
but
gillian
was
watchful
he
avoided
the
antenna
and
at
the
moment
when
the
monster
darted
forward
to
fasten
on
his
breast
he
struck
it
with
the
knife
clenched
in
his
left
hand
there
were
two
convulsions
in
opposite
directions
that
of
the
and
that
of
its
prey
the
movement
was
rapid
as
a
double
flash
of
lightnings
he
had
plunged
the
blade
of
his
knife
into
the
flat
slimy
substance
and
by
a
rapid
movement
like
the
flourish
of
a
whip
in
the
air
describing
a
circle
round
the
two
eyes
he
wrenched
the
head
off
as
a
man
would
draw
a
tooth
the
struggle
was
ended
the
folds
relaxed
the
monster
dropped
away
like
the
slow
detaching
of
bands
the
four
hundred
suckers
deprived
of
their
sustaining
power
dropped
at
once
from
the
man
and
the
rock
the
mass
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
water
breathless
with
the
struggle
gilliatt
could
perceive
upon
the
stones
at
his
feet
two
shapeless
slimy
heaps
the
head
on
one
side
the
remainder
of
the
monster
on
the
other
fearing
nevertheless
some
convulsive
return
of
his
agony
he
recoiled
to
avoid
the
reach
of
the
dreaded
tentacles
but
the
monster
was
quite
dead
gilliatt
closed
his
knife
iv
nothing
is
hidden
nothing
lost
it
was
time
that
he
killed
the
he
was
almost
suffocated
his
right
arm
and
his
chest
were
purple
numberless
little
swellings
were
distinguishable
upon
them
the
blood
flowed
from
them
here
and
there
the
remedy
for
these
wounds
is
gilliatt
plunged
into
it
rubbing
himself
at
the
same
time
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
the
swellings
disappeared
under
the
friction
by
stepping
further
into
the
waters
he
had
without
perceiving
approached
to
the
species
of
recess
already
observed
by
him
near
the
crevice
where
he
had
been
attacked
by
the
this
recess
stretched
obliquely
under
the
great
walls
of
the
cavern
and
was
dry
the
large
pebbles
which
had
become
heaped
up
there
had
raised
the
bottom
above
the
level
of
ordinary
tides
the
entrance
was
a
rather
large
elliptical
arch
a
man
could
enter
by
stooping
the
green
light
of
the
submarine
grotto
penetrated
into
it
and
lighted
it
feebly
it
happened
that
while
hastily
rubbing
his
skin
gilliatt
raised
his
eyes
mechanically
he
was
able
to
see
far
into
the
cavern
he
shuddered
he
fancied
that
he
perceived
in
the
furthest
depth
of
the
dusky
recess
something
smiling
gilliatt
had
never
heard
the
word
hallucination
but
he
was
familiar
with
the
idea
those
mysterious
encounters
with
the
invisible
which
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
the
difficulty
of
explaining
them
we
call
hallucinations
are
in
nature
illusions
or
realities
visions
are
a
fact
he
who
has
the
gift
will
see
them
gilliatt
as
we
have
said
was
a
dreamer
he
had
at
times
the
faculty
of
a
seer
it
was
not
in
vain
that
he
had
spent
his
days
in
musing
among
solitary
places
he
imagined
himself
the
dupe
of
one
of
those
mirages
which
he
had
more
than
once
beheld
when
in
his
dreamy
moods
the
opening
was
somewhat
in
the
shape
of
a
oven
it
was
a
low
niche
with
projections
like
its
abrupt
groins
contracted
gradually
as
far
as
the
extremity
of
the
crypt
where
the
heaps
of
round
stones
and
the
rocky
roof
joined
gilliatt
entered
and
lowering
his
head
advanced
towards
the
object
in
the
distance
there
was
indeed
something
smiling
it
was
a
death
head
but
it
was
not
only
the
head
there
was
the
entire
skeleton
a
complete
human
skeleton
was
lying
in
the
cavern
in
such
a
position
a
bold
man
will
continue
his
researches
gilliatt
cast
his
eyes
around
he
was
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
crabs
the
multitude
did
not
stir
they
were
but
empty
shells
these
groups
were
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
masses
of
pebbles
in
irregular
constellations
gilliatt
having
his
eyes
fixed
elsewhere
had
walked
among
them
without
perceiving
them
at
this
extremity
of
the
crypt
where
he
had
now
penetrated
there
was
a
still
greater
heap
of
remains
it
was
a
confused
mass
of
legs
antennæ
and
mandibles
claws
stood
wide
open
bony
shells
lay
still
under
their
bristling
prickles
some
reversed
showed
their
livid
hollows
the
heap
was
like
a
of
besiegers
who
had
fallen
and
lay
massed
together
the
skeleton
was
partly
buried
in
this
heap
under
this
confused
mass
of
scales
and
tentacles
the
eye
perceived
the
cranium
with
its
furrows
the
vertebræ
the
thigh
bones
the
tibias
and
the
finger
bones
with
their
nails
the
frame
of
the
ribs
was
filled
with
crabs
some
heart
had
once
beat
there
the
green
mould
of
the
sea
had
settled
round
the
sockets
of
the
eyes
limpets
had
left
their
slime
upon
the
bony
nostrils
for
the
rest
there
were
not
in
this
cave
within
the
rocks
either
or
weeds
or
a
breath
of
air
all
was
still
the
teeth
grinned
the
sombre
side
of
laughter
is
that
strange
mockery
of
expression
which
is
peculiar
to
a
human
skull
this
marvellous
palace
of
the
deep
inlaid
and
incrusted
with
all
the
gems
of
the
sea
had
at
length
revealed
and
told
its
secret
it
was
a
savage
haunt
the
inhabited
it
it
was
also
a
tomb
in
which
the
body
of
a
man
reposed
the
skeleton
and
the
creatures
around
it
oscillated
vaguely
in
the
reflections
of
the
subterranean
water
which
trembled
upon
the
roof
and
wall
the
horrible
multitude
of
crabs
looked
as
if
finishing
their
repast
these
crustacea
seemed
to
be
devouring
the
carcase
nothing
could
be
more
strange
than
the
aspect
of
the
dead
vermin
upon
their
dead
prey
gilliatt
had
beneath
his
eyes
the
storehouse
of
the
it
was
a
dismal
sight
the
crabs
had
devoured
the
man
the
had
devoured
the
crabs
there
were
no
remains
of
clothing
anywhere
visible
the
man
must
have
been
seized
naked
gilliatt
attentively
examining
began
to
remove
the
shells
from
the
skeleton
what
had
this
man
been
the
body
was
admirably
dissected
it
looked
as
if
prepared
for
the
study
of
anatomy
all
the
flesh
was
stripped
not
a
muscle
remained
not
a
bone
was
missing
if
gilliatt
had
been
learned
in
science
he
might
have
demonstrated
the
fact
the
periostea
denuded
of
their
covering
were
white
and
smooth
as
if
they
had
been
polished
but
for
some
green
mould
of
here
and
there
they
would
have
been
like
ivory
the
cartilaginous
divisions
were
delicately
inlaid
and
arranged
the
tomb
sometimes
produces
this
dismal
mosaic
work
the
body
was
as
it
were
interred
under
the
heap
of
dead
crabs
gilliatt
disinterred
it
suddenly
he
stooped
and
examined
more
closely
he
had
perceived
around
the
vertebral
column
a
sort
of
belt
it
was
a
leathern
girdle
which
had
evidently
been
worn
buckled
upon
the
waist
of
the
man
when
alive
the
leather
was
moist
the
buckle
rusty
gilliatt
pulled
the
girdle
the
vertebra
of
the
skeleton
resisted
and
he
was
compelled
to
break
through
them
in
order
to
remove
it
a
crust
of
small
shells
had
begun
to
form
upon
it
he
felt
it
and
found
a
hard
substance
within
apparently
of
square
form
it
was
useless
to
endeavour
to
unfasten
the
buckle
so
he
cut
the
leather
with
his
knife
the
girdle
contained
a
little
iron
box
and
some
pieces
of
gold
gilliatt
counted
twenty
guineas
the
iron
box
was
an
old
sailor
opening
and
shutting
with
a
spring
it
was
very
tight
and
rusty
the
spring
being
completely
oxidised
would
not
work
once
more
the
knife
served
gilliatt
in
a
difficulty
a
pressure
with
the
point
of
the
blade
caused
the
lid
to
fly
up
the
box
was
open
there
was
nothing
inside
but
pieces
of
paper
a
little
roll
of
very
thin
sheets
folded
in
four
was
fitted
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
they
were
damp
but
not
injured
the
box
hermetically
sealed
had
preserved
them
gilliatt
unfolded
them
they
were
three
of
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
each
making
together
thousand
francs
gilliatt
folded
them
again
replaced
them
in
the
box
taking
advantage
of
the
space
which
remained
to
add
the
twenty
guineas
and
then
reclosed
the
box
as
well
as
he
could
next
he
examined
the
girdle
the
leather
which
had
originally
been
polished
outside
was
rough
within
upon
this
tawny
ground
some
letters
had
been
traced
in
black
thick
ink
gilliatt
deciphered
them
and
read
the
words
sieur
clubin
v
the
fatal
difference
between
six
inches
and
two
feet
gilliatt
replaced
the
box
in
the
girdle
and
placed
the
girdle
in
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
he
left
the
skeleton
among
the
crabs
with
the
remains
of
the
beside
it
while
he
had
been
occupied
with
the
and
the
skeleton
the
rising
tide
had
submerged
the
entrance
to
the
cave
he
was
only
enabled
to
leave
it
by
plunging
under
the
arched
entrance
he
got
through
without
difficulty
for
he
knew
the
entrance
well
and
was
master
of
these
gymnastics
in
the
sea
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
drama
which
had
taken
place
there
during
the
ten
weeks
preceding
one
monster
had
preyed
upon
another
the
had
seized
clubin
these
two
embodiments
of
treachery
had
met
in
the
inexorable
darkness
there
had
been
an
encounter
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
between
these
two
compounds
of
mystery
and
watchfulness
the
monster
had
destroyed
the
man
a
horrible
fulfilment
of
justice
the
crab
feeds
on
carrion
the

crabs
the
seizes
as
it
passes
any
swimming
animal
an
otter
a
dog
a
man
if
it
can
sucks
the
blood
and
leaves
the
body
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
the
crabs
are
the
scavengers
of
the
sea
putrefying

they
crowd
round
it
devour

and
are
in
their
turn
consumed

the

in

this
is
the
law
which
we
have
already
pointed
out
the
had
laid
hold
of
him
and
drowned
him
some
wave
had
carried
his
body
into
the
cave
and
deposited
it
at
the
extremity
of
the
inner
cavern
where
gilliatt
had
discovered
it
he
returned
searching
among
the
rocks
for
and
limpets
he
had
no
desire
for
crabs
to
have
eaten
them
now
would
have
seemed
to
him
like
feeding
upon
human
flesh
for
the
rest
he
thought
of
nothing
but
of
eating
what
he
could
before
starting
nothing
now
interposed
to
prevent
his
departure
great
tempests
are
always
followed
by
a
calm
which
lasts
sometimes
several
days
there
was
therefore
no
danger
from
the
sea
gilliatt
had
resolved
to
leave
the
rocks
on
the
following
day
it
was
important
on
account
of
the
tide
to
keep
the
barrier
between
the
two
douvres
during
the
night
but
he
intended
to
remove
it
at
daybreak
to
push
the
sloop
out
to
sea
and
set
sail
for
sampson
the
light
breeze
which
was
blowing
came
from
the
which
was
precisely
the
wind
which
he
would
want
it
was
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
moon
in
the
month
of
may
the
days
were
long
when
gilliatt
having
finished
his
wanderings
among
the
rocks
and
appeased
his
appetite
to
some
extent
returned
to
the
passage
between
the
two
douvres
where
he
had
left
the
sloop
the
sun
had
set
the
twilight
was
increased
by
that
pale
light
which
comes
from
a
crescent
moon
the
tide
had
attained
its
height
and
was
beginning
to
ebb
the
funnel
standing
upright
above
the
sloop
had
been
covered
by
the
foam
during
the
tempest
with
a
coating
of
salt
which
glittered
white
in
the
light
of
the
moon
this
circumstance
reminded
gilliatt
that
the
storm
had
inundated
the
sloop
both
with
surf
and
and
that
if
he
meant
to
start
in
the
morning
it
would
be
necessary
to
bail
it
out
before
leaving
to
go
in
quest
of
crabs
he
had
ascertained
that
it
had
about
six
inches
of
water
in
the
hold
the
scoop
which
he
used
for
the
purpose
would
he
thought
be
sufficient
for
throwing
the
water
overboard
on
arriving
at
the
barrier
gilliatt
was
struck
with
terror
there
were
nearly
two
feet
of
water
in
the
sloop
a
terrible
discovery
the
bark
had
sprung
a
leak
she
had
been
making
water
gradually
during
his
absence
burdened
as
she
was
two
feet
of
water
was
a
perilous
addition
a
little
more
and
she
must
inevitably
founder
if
he
had
returned
but
an
hour
later
he
would
probably
have
found
nothing
above
water
but
the
funnel
and
the
mast
there
was
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
in
deliberation
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
find
the
leakage
stop
it
and
then
empty
the
vessel
or
at
all
events
lighten
it
the
pumps
of
the
durande
had
been
lost
in
the
of
the
wreck
he
was
reduced
to
use
the
scoop
of
the
bark
to
find
the
leak
was
the
most
urgent
necessity
gilliatt
set
to
work
immediately
and
without
even
giving
himself
time
to
dress
he
shivered
but
he
no
longer
felt
either
hunger
or
cold
the
water
continued
to
gain
upon
his
vessel
fortunately
there
was
no
wind
the
slightest
swell
would
have
been
fatal
the
moon
went
down
bent
low
and
plunged
in
the
water
deeper
than
his
waist
he
groped
about
for
a
long
time
he
discovered
the
mischief
at
last
during
the
gale
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
sloop
had
swerved
the
strong
bark
had
bumped
and
grazed
rather
violently
on
the
rocks
one
of
the
projections
of
the
little
douvre
had
made
a
fracture
in
the
starboard
side
of
the
hull
the
leak
unluckily
it
might
almost
have
been
said
maliciously
had
been
made
near
the
joint
of
the
two
riders
a
fact
which
joined
with
the
fury
of
the
hurricane
had
prevented
him
perceiving
it
during
his
dark
and
rapid
survey
in
the
height
of
the
storm
the
fracture
was
alarming
on
account
of
its
size
but
fortunately
although
the
vessel
was
sunk
lower
than
usual
by
the
weight
of
water
it
was
still
above
the
ordinary
at
the
moment
when
the
accident
had
occurred
the
waves
had
rolled
heavily
into
the
defile
and
had
flooded
through
the
breach
and
the
vessel
had
sunk
a
few
inches
under
the
additional
weight
so
that
even
after
the
subsidence
of
the
water
the
weight
having
raised
the
had
kept
the
hole
still
under
the
surface
hence
the
imminence
of
the
danger
but
if
he
could
succeed
in
stopping
the
leak
he
could
empty
the
sloop
the
hole
once
staunched
the
vessel
would
rise
to
its
usual
the
fracture
would
be
above
water
and
in
this
position
the
repair
would
be
easy
or
at
least
possible
he
had
still
as
we
have
already
said
his
carpenters
tools
in
good
condition
but
meanwhile
what
uncertainty
must
he
not
endure
what
perils
what
chances
of
accidents
he
heard
the
water
rising
inexorably
one
shock
and
all
would
have
perished
what
misery
seemed
in
store
for
him
perhaps
his
endeavours
were
even
now
too
late
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
he
thought
that
he
ought
to
have
seen
the
damage
immediately
the
six
inches
of
water
in
the
hold
ought
to
have
suggested
it
to
him
he
had
been
stupid
enough
to
attribute
these
six
inches
of
water
to
the
rain
and
the
foam
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
slept
and
eaten
he
taxed
himself
even
with
his
weariness
and
almost
with
the
storm
and
the
dark
night
all
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
his
own
fault
these
bitter
filled
his
mind
while
engaged
in
his
labour
but
they
did
not
prevent
his
considering
well
the
work
he
was
engaged
in
the
leak
had
been
found
that
was
the
first
step
to
staunch
it
was
the
second
that
was
all
that
was
possible
for
the
moment
joinery
work
can
not
be
carried
on
under
water
it
was
a
favourable
circumstance
that
the
breach
in
the
hull
was
in
the
space
between
the
two
chains
which
held
the
funnel
fast
on
the
starboard
side
the
stuffing
with
which
it
was
necessary
to
stop
it
could
be
fixed
to
these
chains
the
water
meanwhile
was
gaining
its
depth
was
now
between
two
and
three
feet
and
it
reached
above
his
knees
vi
de
profundis
ad
altum
gilliatt
had
to
his
hand
among
his
reserve
of
rigging
for
the
sloop
a
pretty
large
tarpaulin
furnished
with
long
laniards
at
the
four
corners
he
took
this
tarpaulin
made
fast
the
two
corners
by
the
laniards
to
the
two
rings
of
the
chains
of
the
funnel
on
the
same
side
as
the
leak
and
threw
it
over
the
gunwale
the
tarpaulin
hung
like
a
sheet
between
the
little
douvre
and
the
bark
and
sunk
in
the
water
the
pressure
of
the
water
endeavouring
to
enter
into
the
hold
kept
it
close
to
the
hull
upon
the
gap
the
heavier
the
pressure
the
closer
the
sail
adhered
it
was
stuck
by
the
water
itself
right
upon
the
fracture
the
wound
of
the
bark
was
staunched
the
tarred
canvas
formed
an
effectual
barrier
between
the
interior
of
the
hold
and
the
waves
without
not
a
drop
of
water
entered
the
leak
was
masked
but
was
not
stopped
it
was
a
respite
only
gilliatt
took
the
scoop
and
began
to
bale
the
sloop
it
was
time
that
she
were
lightened
the
labour
warmed
him
a
little
but
his
weariness
was
extreme
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
could
not
complete
the
work
of
staunching
the
hold
he
had
scarcely
eaten
anything
and
he
had
the
humiliation
of
feeling
himself
exhausted
he
measured
the
progress
of
his
work
by
the
sinking
of
the
level
of
water
below
his
knees
the
fall
was
slow
moreover
the
leakage
was
only
interrupted
the
evil
was
moderated
not
repaired
the
tarpaulin
pushed
into
the
gap
began
to
bulge
inside
looking
as
if
a
fist
were
under
the
canvas
endeavouring
to
force
it
through
the
canvas
strong
and
pitchy
resisted
but
the
swelling
and
the
tension
increased
it
was
not
certain
that
it
would
not
give
way
and
at
any
moment
the
swelling
might
become
a
rent
the
irruption
of
water
must
then
recommence
in
such
a
case
as
the
crews
of
vessels
in
distress
know
well
there
is
no
other
remedy
than
stuffing
the
sailors
take
rags
of
every
kind
which
they
can
find
at
hand
everything
in
fact
which
in
their
language
is
called
service
and
with
this
they
push
the
bulging
as
far
as
they
can
into
the
leak
of
this
service
gilliatt
had
none
all
the
rags
and
tow
which
he
had
stored
up
had
been
used
in
his
operations
or
carried
away
by
the
storm
if
necessary
he
might
possibly
have
been
able
to
find
some
remains
by
searching
among
the
rocks
the
sloop
was
sufficiently
lightened
for
him
to
leave
it
with
safety
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
how
could
he
make
this
search
without
a
light
the
darkness
was
complete
there
was
no
longer
any
moon
nothing
but
the
starry
sky
he
had
no
dry
tow
with
which
to
make
a
match
no
tallow
to
make
a
candle
no
fire
to
light
one
no
lantern
to
shelter
it
from
the
wind
in
the
sloop
and
among
the
rocks
all
was
confused
and
indistinct
he
could
hear
the
water
lapping
against
the
wounded
hull
but
he
could
not
even
see
the
crack
it
was
with
his
hands
that
he
had
ascertained
the
bulging
of
the
tarpaulin
in
that
darkness
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
useful
search
for
rags
of
canvas
or
pieces
of
tow
scattered
among
the
breakers
who
could
glean
these
waifs
and
strays
without
being
able
to
see
his
path
gilliatt
looked
sorrowfully
at
the
sky
all
those
stars
he
thought
and
yet
no
light
the
water
in
the
bark
having
diminished
the
pressure
from
without
increased
the
bulging
of
the
canvas
became
larger
and
was
still
increasing
like
a
frightful
abscess
ready
to
burst
the
situation
which
had
been
improved
for
a
short
time
began
to
be
threatening
some
means
of
stopping
it
effectually
was
absolutely
necessary
he
had
nothing
left
but
his
clothes
which
he
had
stretched
to
dry
upon
the
projecting
rocks
of
the
little
douvre
he
hastened
to
fetch
them
and
placed
them
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
sloop
then
he
took
his
tarpaulin
overcoat
and
kneeling
in
the
water
thrust
it
into
the
crevice
and
pushing
the
swelling
of
the
sail
outward
emptied
it
of
water
to
the
tarpaulin
coat
he
added
the
sheepskin
then
his
guernsey
shirt
and
then
his
jacket
the
hole
received
them
all
he
had
nothing
left
but
his
sailor
trousers
which
he
took
off
and
pushed
in
with
the
other
articles
this
enlarged
and
strengthened
the
stuffing
the
stopper
was
made
and
it
appeared
to
be
sufficient
these
clothes
passed
partly
through
the
gap
the
outside
enveloping
them
the
sea
making
an
effort
to
enter
pressed
against
the
obstacle
spread
it
over
the
gap
and
blocked
it
it
was
a
sort
of
exterior
compression
inside
the
centre
only
of
the
bulging
having
been
driven
out
there
remained
all
around
the
gap
and
the
stuffing
just
thrust
through
a
sort
of
circular
pad
formed
by
the
tarpaulin
which
was
rendered
still
firmer
by
the
irregularities
of
the
fracture
with
which
it
had
become
entangled
the
leak
was
staunched
but
nothing
could
be
more
precarious
those
sharp
splinters
of
the
gap
which
fixed
the
tarpaulin
might
pierce
it
and
make
holes
by
which
the
water
would
enter
while
he
would
not
even
perceive
it
in
the
darkness
there
was
little
probability
of
the
stoppage
lasting
until
daylight
gilliatt
anxiety
changed
its
form
but
he
felt
it
increasing
at
the
same
time
that
he
found
his
strength
leaving
him
he
had
again
set
to
work
to
bale
out
the
hold
but
his
arms
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
could
scarcely
lift
a
scoopfull
of
water
he
was
naked
and
shivering
he
felt
as
if
the
end
were
now
at
hand
one
possible
chance
flashed
across
his
mind
there
might
be
a
sail
in
sight
a
which
should
by
any
accident
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
douvres
might
come
to
his
assistance
the
moment
had
arrived
when
a
helpmate
was
absolutely
necessary
with
a
man
and
a
lantern
all
might
yet
be
saved
if
there
were
two
persons
one
might
easily
bale
the
vessel
since
the
leak
was
temporarily
staunched
as
soon
as
she
could
be
relieved
of
this
burden
she
would
rise
and
regain
her
ordinary
the
leak
would
then
be
above
the
surface
of
the
water
the
repairs
would
be
practicable
and
he
would
be
able
immediately
to
replace
the
stuff
by
a
piece
of
planking
and
thus
substitute
for
the
temporary
stoppage
a
complete
repair
if
not
it
would
be
necessary
to
wait
till
daylight
to
wait
the
whole
night
long
a
delay
which
might
prove
ruinous
if
by
chance
some
ship
lantern
should
be
in
sight
gilliatt
would
be
able
to
signal
it
from
the
height
of
the
great
douvre
the
weather
was
calm
there
was
no
wind
or
rolling
sea
there
was
a
possibility
of
the
figure
of
a
man
being
observed
moving
against
the
background
of
the
starry
sky
a
captain
of
a
ship
or
even
the
master
of
a
would
not
be
at
night
in
the
waters
of
the
douvres
without
directing
his
glass
upon
the
rock
by
way
of
precaution
gilliatt
hoped
that
some
one
might
perceive
him
he
climbed
upon
the
wreck
grasped
the
knotted
rope
and
mounted
upon
the
great
douvre
not
a
sail
was
visible
around
the
horizon
not
a
boat
lantern
the
wide
expanse
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
was
a
desert
no
assistance
was
possible
and
no
resistance
possible
gilliatt
felt
himself
without
resources
a
feeling
which
he
had
not
felt
until
then
a
dark
fatality
was
now
his
master
with
all
his
labour
all
his
success
all
his
courage
he
and
his
bark
and
its
precious
burden
were
about
to
become
the
sport
of
the
waves
he
had
no
other
means
of
continuing
the
struggle
he
became
listless
how
could
he
prevent
the
tide
from
returning
the
water
from
rising
the
night
from
continuing
the
temporary
stoppage
which
he
had
made
was
his
sole
reliance
he
had
exhausted
and
stripped
himself
in
constructing
and
completing
it
he
could
neither
fortify
nor
add
to
it
the
stopgap
was
such
that
it
must
remain
as
it
was
and
every
further
effort
was
useless
the
apparatus
hastily
constructed
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
how
would
this
inert
obstacle
work
it
was
this
obstacle
now
not
gilliatt
which
had
to
sustain
the
combat
that
handfull
of
rags
not
that
intelligence
the
swell
of
a
wave
would
suffice
to
the
fracture
more
or
less
of
pressure
the
whole
question
was
comprised
in
that
formula
all
depended
upon
a
brute
struggle
between
two
mechanical
quantities
henceforth
he
could
neither
aid
his
auxiliary
nor
stop
his
enemy
he
was
no
longer
any
other
than
a
mere
spectator
of
this
struggle
which
was
one
for
him
of
life
or
death
he
who
had
ruled
over
it
a
supreme
intelligence
was
at
the
last
moment
compelled
to
resign
all
to
a
mere
blind
resistance
no
trial
no
terror
that
he
had
yet
undergone
could
bear
comparison
with
this
from
the
time
when
he
had
taken
up
his
abode
upon
the
douvres
he
had
found
himself
environed
and
as
it
were
possessed
by
solitude
this
solitude
more
than
surrounded
it
enveloped
him
a
thousand
menaces
at
once
had
met
him
face
to
face
the
wind
was
always
there
ready
to
become
furious
the
sea
ready
to
roar
there
was
no
stopping
that
terrible
mouth
the
wind
no
imprisoning
that
dread
monster
the
sea
and
yet
he
had
striven
he
a
solitary
man
had
combated
hand
to
hand
with
the
ocean
had
wrestled
even
with
the
tempest
many
other
anxieties
many
other
necessities
had
he
made
head
against
there
was
no
form
of
distress
with
which
he
had
not
become
familiar
he
had
been
compelled
to
execute
great
works
without
tools
to
move
vast
burdens
without
aid
without
science
to
resolve
problems
without
provisions
to
find
food
without
bed
or
roof
to
cover
it
to
find
shelter
and
sleep
upon
that
solitary
rock
he
had
been
subjected
by
turns
to
all
the
varied
and
cruel
tortures
of
nature
oftentimes
a
gentle
mother
not
less
often
a
pitiless
destroyer
he
had
conquered
his
isolation
conquered
hunger
conquered
thirst
conquered
cold
conquered
fever
conquered
labour
conquered
sleep
he
had
encountered
a
mighty
coalition
of
obstacles
formed
to
bar
his
progress
after
his
privations
there
were
the
elements
after
the
sea
the
tempest
after
the
tempest
the
after
the
monster
the
spectre
a
dismal
irony
was
then
the
end
of
all
upon
this
rock
whence
he
had
thought
to
arise
triumphant
the
spectre
of
clubin
had
only
arisen
to
mock
him
with
a
hideous
smile
the
grin
of
the
spectre
was
well
founded
gilliatt
saw
himself
ruined
saw
himself
no
less
than
clubin
in
the
grasp
of
death
winter
famine
fatigue
the
dismemberment
of
the
wreck
the
removal
of
the
machinery
the
equinoctial
gale
the
thunder
the
monster
were
all
as
nothing
compared
with
this
small
fracture
in
a
vessel
planks
against
the
cold
one
could
procure
and
he
had
procured
fire
against
hunger
the
of
the
rocks
against
thirst
the
rain
against
the
difficulties
of
his
great
task
industry
and
energy
against
the
sea
and
the
storm
the
breakwater
against
the
the
knife
but
against
the
terrible
leak
he
had
no
weapon
the
hurricane
had
bequeathed
him
this
sinister
farewell
the
last
struggle
the
traitorous
thrust
the
treacherous
side
blow
of
the
vanquished
foe
in
its
flight
the
tempest
had
turned
and
shot
this
arrow
in
the
rear
it
was
the
final
and
deadly
stab
of
his
antagonist
it
was
possible
to
combat
with
the
tempest
but
how
could
he
struggle
with
that
insidious
enemy
who
now
attacked
him
if
the
stoppage
gave
way
if
the
leak
nothing
could
prevent
the
sloop
foundering
it
would
be
the
bursting
of
the
ligature
of
the
artery
and
once
under
the
water
with
its
heavy
burden
no
power
could
raise
it
the
noble
struggle
with
two
months
titanic
labour
ended
then
in
annihilation
to
recommence
would
be
impossible
he
had
neither
forge
nor
materials
at
daylight
in
all
probability
he
was
about
to
see
all
his
work
sink
slowly
and
irrecoverably
into
the
gulf
terrible
to
feel
that
sombre
power
beneath
the
sea
snatched
his
prize
from
his
hands
with
his
bark
engulfed
no
fate
awaited
him
but
to
perish
of
hunger
and
cold
like
the
poor
shipwrecked
sailor
on
the
man
rock
during
two
long
months
the
intelligences
which
hover
invisibly
over
the
world
had
been
the
spectators
of
these
things
on
one
hand
the
wide
expanse
the
waves
the
winds
the
lightnings
the
meteors
on
the
other
a
man
on
one
hand
the
sea
on
the
other
a
human
mind
on
the
one
hand
the
infinite
on
the
other
an
atom
the
battle
had
been
fierce
and
behold
the
abortive
issue
of
these
prodigies
of
valour
thus
did
this
heroism
without
parallel
end
in
powerlessness
thus
ended
in
despair
that
formidable
struggle
that
struggle
of
a
nothing
against
all
that
iliad
against
one
gilliatt
gazed
wildly
into
space
he
had
no
clothing
he
stood
naked
in
the
midst
of
that
immensity
then
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
that
unknown
infinity
like
one
bewildered
by
a
strange
persecution
confronting
the
shadows
of
night
in
the
presence
of
that
impenetrable
darkness
in
the
midst
of
the
murmur
of
the
waves
the
swell
the
foam
the
breeze
under
the
clouds
under
that
vast
diffusion
of
force
under
that
mysterious
firmament
of
wings
of
stars
of
gulfs
having
around
him
and
beneath
him
the
ocean
above
him
the
constellations
under
the
great
unfathomable
deep
he
sank
gave
up
the
struggle
lay
down
upon
the
rock
his
face
towards
the
stars
humbled
and
uplifting
his
joined
hands
towards
the
terrible
depths
he
cried
aloud
have
mercy
weighed
down
to
earth
by
that
immensity
he
prayed
he
was
there
alone
in
the
darkness
upon
the
rock
in
the
midst
of
that
sea
stricken
down
with
exhaustion
like
one
smitten
by
lightning
naked
like
the
gladiator
in
the
circus
save
that
for
circus
he
had
the
vast
horizon
instead
of
wild
beasts
the
shadows
of
darkness
instead
of
the
faces
of
the
crowd
the
eyes
of
the
unknown
instead
of
the
vestals
the
stars
instead
of
cæsar
the
his
whole
being
seemed
to
dissolve
in
cold
fatigue
powerlessness
prayer
and
darkness
and
his
eyes
closed
vii
the
appeal
is
heard
some
hours
passed
the
sun
rose
in
an
unclouded
sky
its
first
ray
shone
upon
a
motionless
form
upon
the
great
douvre
it
was
gilliatt
he
was
still
outstretched
upon
the
rock
he
was
naked
cold
and
stiff
but
he
did
not
shiver
his
closed
eyelids
were
wan
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
beholder
to
say
whether
the
form
before
him
was
not
a
corpse
the
sun
seemed
to
look
upon
him
if
he
were
not
dead
he
was
already
so
near
death
that
the
slightest
cold
wind
would
have
sufficed
to
extinguish
life
the
wind
began
to
breathe
warm
and
animating
it
was
the
opening
breath
of
may
meanwhile
the
sun
ascended
in
the
deep
blue
sky
its
rays
less
horizontal
flushed
the
sky
its
light
became
warmth
it
enveloped
the
slumbering
form
gilliatt
moved
not
if
he
breathed
it
was
only
that
feeble
respiration
which
could
scarcely
tarnish
the
surface
of
a
mirror
the
sun
continued
its
ascent
its
rays
striking
less
and
less
obliquely
upon
the
naked
man
the
gentle
breeze
which
had
been
merely
tepid
became
hot
the
rigid
and
naked
body
remained
still
without
movement
but
the
skin
seemed
less
livid
the
sun
approaching
the
zenith
shone
almost
perpendicularly
upon
the
plateau
of
the
douvres
a
flood
of
light
descended
from
the
heavens
the
vast
reflection
from
the
glassy
sea
increased
its
splendour
the
rock
itself
imbibed
the
rays
and
warmed
the
sleeper
a
sigh
raised
his
breast
he
lived
the
sun
continued
its
gentle
offices
the
wind
which
was
already
the
breath
of
summer
and
of
noon
approached
him
like
loving
lips
that
breathed
upon
him
softly
gilliatt
moved
the
peaceful
calm
upon
the
sea
was
perfect
its
murmur
was
like
the
droning
of
the
nurse
beside
the
sleeping
infant
the
rock
seemed
cradled
in
the
waves
the
who
knew
that
form
fluttered
above
it
not
with
their
old
wild
astonishment
but
with
a
sort
of
fraternal
tenderness
they
uttered
plaintive
cries
they
seemed
to
be
calling
to
him
a
who
no
doubt
knew
him
was
tame
enough
to
come
near
him
it
began
to
caw
as
if
speaking
to
him
the
sleeper
seemed
not
to
hear
the
bird
hopped
upon
his
shoulder
and
pecked
his
lips
softly
gilliatt
opened
his
eyes
the
birds
dispersed
chattering
wildly
gilliatt
arose
stretched
himself
like
a
roused
lion
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
looked
down
into
the
space
between
the
two
douvres
the
sloop
was
there
intact
the
stoppage
had
held
out
the
sea
had
probably
disturbed
it
but
little
all
was
saved
he
was
no
longer
weary
his
powers
had
returned
his
swoon
had
ended
in
a
deep
sleep
he
descended
and
baled
out
the
sloop
emptied
the
hold
raised
the
leakage
above
the
dressed
himself
ate
drank
some
water
and
was
joyful
the
gap
in
the
side
of
his
vessel
examined
in
broad
daylight
proved
to
require
more
labour
than
he
had
thought
it
was
a
serious
fracture
the
entire
day
was
not
too
much
for
its
repair
at
daybreak
on
the
morrow
after
removing
the
barrier
and
the
entrance
to
the
defile
dressed
in
the
tattered
clothing
which
had
served
to
stop
the
leak
having
about
him
clubin
girdle
and
the
thousand
francs
standing
erect
in
the
sloop
now
repaired
by
the
side
of
the
machinery
which
he
had
rescued
with
a
favourable
breeze
and
a
good
sea
gilliatt
pushed
off
from
the
douvres
he
put
the
sloop
head
for
guernsey
at
the
moment
of
his
departure
from
the
rocks
any
one
who
had
been
there
might
have
heard
him
singing
in
an
undertone

the
sampson
of
the
present
day
is
almost
a
city
the
sampson
of
forty
years
since
was
almost
a
village
when
the
winter
evenings
were
ended
and
spring
had
come
the
inhabitants
were
not
long
out
of
bed
after
sundown
sampson
was
an
ancient
parish
which
had
long
been
accustomed
to
the
sound
of
the
and
which
had
a
traditional
habit
of
blowing
out
the
candle
at
an
early
hour
those
old
norman
villages
are
famous
for
early
roosting
and
the
villagers
are
generally
great
rearers
of
poultry
the
people
of
sampson
except
a
few
rich
families
among
the
townsfolk
are
also
a
population
of

and
carpenters

one
evening
in
the
commencement
of

of

after
watching
the
crescent

for
some
instants
through

to
the

of

walking
alone
in
the
cool

on

the
whole

were
sleeping

and

were

closed

silent
in
the
streets
some
few
lights
like
winking
eyes
about

showed
here

there
in
windows
in

already

in

with

the
peculiarity
of

for
its

four

iiii
which
are
used
to
signify
eleven
hundred
and

the
popularity
of
mess
lethierry
at
sampson
had
been
founded
on
his
success
the
success
at
an
end
there
had
come
a
void
it
might
be
imagined
that
is
contagious
and
that
the
unsuccessful
have
a
plague
so
rapidly
are
they
put
in
quarantine
the
young
men
of
families
avoided
déruchette
the
isolation
around
the
bravées
was
so
complete
that
its
inmates
had
not
even
yet
heard
the
news
of
the
great
local
event
which
had
that
day
set
all
sampson
in
a
ferment
the
rector
of
the
parish
the
rev
ebenezer
caudray
had
become
rich
his
uncle
the
magnificent
dean
of
asaph
had
just
died
in
london
the
news
had
been
brought
by
the
mail
sloop
the
arrived
from
england
that
very
morning
and
the
mast
of
which
could
be
perceived
in
the
roads
of
peter
port
the
was
to
depart
for
southampton
at
noon
on
the
morrow
and
so
the
rumour
ran
to
convey
the
reverend
gentleman
who
had
been
suddenly
summoned
to
england
to
be
present
at
the
official
opening
of
the
will
not
to
speak
of
other
urgent
matters
connected
with
an
important
inheritance
all
day
long
sampson
had
been
conversing
on
this
subject
the
the
rev
ebenezer
his
deceased
uncle
his
riches
his
departure
his
possible
preferment
in
the
future
had
formed
the
foundations
of
that
perpetual
buzzing
a
solitary
house
still
uninformed
on
these
matters
had
remained
at
peace
this
was
the
bravées
mess
lethierry
had
jumped
into
his
hammock
and
lay
down
in
his
clothing
since
the
catastrophe
of
the
durande
to
get
into
his
hammock
had
been
his
resource
every
captive
has
recourse
to
stretching
himself
upon
his
pallet
and
mess
lethierry
was
the
captive
of
his
grief
to
go
to
bed
was
a
truce
a
gain
in
breathing
time
a
suspension
of
ideas
he
neither
slept
nor
watched
strictly
speaking
for
two
months
and
a
half
for
so
long
was
it
since
his
misfortune
mess
lethierry
had
been
in
a
sort
of
somnambulism
he
had
not
yet
regained
possession
of
his
faculties
he
was
in
that
cloudy
and
confused
condition
of
intellect
with
which
those
are
familiar
who
have
undergone
overwhelming
afflictions
his
reflections
were
not
thought
his
sleep
was
no
repose
by
day
he
was
not
awake
by
night
not
asleep
he
was
up
and
then
gone
to
rest
that
was
all
when
he
was
in
his
hammock
forgetfulness
came
to
him
a
little
he
called
that
sleeping
chimeras
floated
about
him
and
within
him
the
nocturnal
cloud
full
of
confused
faces
traversed
his
brain
sometimes
it
was
the
emperor
napoleon
dictating
to
him
the
story
of
his
life
sometimes
there
were
several
déruchettes
strange
birds
were
in
the
trees
the
streets
of
became
serpents
nightmares
were
the
brief
respites
of
despair
he
passed
his
nights
in
dreaming
and
his
days
in
reverie
sometimes
he
remained
all
the
afternoon
at
the
window
of
his
room
which
looked
out
upon
the
port
with
his
head
drooping
his
elbows
on
the
stone
his
ears
resting
on
his
fists
his
back
turned
to
the
whole
world
his
eye
fixed
on
the
old
massive
iron
ring
fastened
in
the
wall
of
the
house
at
only
a
few
feet
from
his
window
where
in
the
old
days
he
used
to
moor
the
durande
he
was
looking
at
the
rust
which
gathered
on
the
ring
he
was
reduced
to
the
mere
mechanical
habit
of
living
the
bravest
men
when
deprived
of
their
most
cherished
idea
will
come
to
this
his
life
had
become
a
void
life
is
a
voyage
the
idea
is
the
itinerary
the
plan
of
their
course
gone
they
stop
the
object
is
lost
the
strength
of
purpose
gone
fate
has
a
secret
discretionary
power
it
is
able
to
touch
with
its
rod
even
our
moral
being
despair
is
almost
the
destitution
of
the
soul
only
the
greatest
minds
resist
and
for
what
mess
lethierry
was
always
meditating
if
absorption
can
be
called
meditation
in
the
depth
of
a
sort
of
cloudy
abyss
broken
words
sometimes
escaped
him
like
these
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
now
but
to
ask
yonder
for
leave
to
go
there
was
a
certain
contradiction
in
that
nature
complex
as
the
sea
of
which
mess
lethierry
was
so
to
speak
the
product
mess
grief
did
not
seek
relief
in
prayer
to
be
powerless
is
a
certain
strength
in
the
presence
of
our
two
great
expressions
of
this
blindness
destiny
and
nature
it
is
in
his
powerlessness
that
man
has
found
his
chief
support
in
prayer
man
seeks
succour
from
his
terror
his
anxiety
bids
him
kneel
prayer
that
mighty
force
of
the
soul
akin
to
mystery
prayer
addresses
itself
to
the
magnanimity
of
the
shades
prayer
regards
mystery
with
eyes
themselves
overshadowed
by
it
and
beneath
the
power
of
its
fixed
and
appealing
gaze
we
feel
the
possibility
of
the
great
unknown
unbending
to
reply
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
possibility
becomes
a
consolation
but
mess
lethierry
prayed
not
in
the
time
when
he
was
happy
god
existed
for
him
almost
in
visible
contact
lethierry
addressed
him
pledged
his
word
to
him
seemed
at
times
to
hold
familiar
intercourse
with
him
but
in
the
hour
of
his
misfortune
a
phenomenon
not
infrequent
the
idea
of
god
had
become
eclipsed
in
his
mind
this
happens
when
the
mind
has
created
for
itself
a
deity
clothed
with
human
qualities
in
the
state
of
mind
in
which
he
existed
there
was
for
lethierry
only
one
clear
vision
the
smile
of
déruchette
beyond
this
all
was
dark
for
some
time
apparently
on
account
of
the
loss
of
the
durande
and
of
the
blow
which
it
had
been
to
them
this
pleasant
smile
had
been
rare
she
seemed
always
thoughtful
her
birdlike
playfulness
her
childlike
ways
were
gone
she
was
never
seen
now
in
the
morning
at
the
sound
of
the
cannon
which
announced
daybreak
saluting
the
rising
sun
with
boom
daylight
come
in
please
at
times
her
expression
was
very
serious
a
sad
thing
for
that
sweet
nature
she
made
an
effort
however
sometimes
to
laugh
before
mess
lethierry
and
to
divert
him
but
her
cheerfulness
grew
tarnished
from
day
to
day
gathered
dust
like
the
wing
of
a
butterfly
with
a
pin
through
its
body
whether
through
sorrow
for
her
uncle
sorrow
for
there
are
griefs
which
are
the
reflections
of
other
griefs
or
whether
for
any
other
reasons
she
appeared
at
this
time
to
be
much
inclined
towards
religion
in
the
time
of
the
old
rector
jaquemin
hérode
she
scarcely
went
to
church
as
has
been
already
said
four
times
a
year
now
she
was
on
the
contrary
assiduous
in
her
attendance
she
missed
no
service
neither
of
sunday
nor
of
thursday
pious
souls
in
the
parish
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
amendment
for
it
is
a
great
blessing
when
a
girl
who
runs
so
many
dangers
in
the
world
turns
her
thoughts
towards
god
that
enables
the
poor
parents
at
least
to
be
easy
on
the
subject
of
and
what
not
in
the
evening
whenever
the
weather
permitted
she
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
garden
of
the
bravées
she
was
almost
as
pensive
there
as
mess
lethierry
and
almost
always
alone
déruchette
went
to
bed
last
this
however
did
not
prevent
douce
and
grace
watching
her
a
little
by
that
instinct
for
spying
which
is
common
to
servants
spying
is
such
a
relaxation
after
household
work
as
to
mess
lethierry
in
the
abstracted
state
of
his
mind
these
little
changes
in
déruchette
habits
escaped
him
moreover
his
nature
had
little
in
common
with
the
duenna
he
had
not
even
remarked
her
regularity
at
the
church
tenacious
of
his
prejudices
against
the
clergy
and
their
sermons
he
would
have
seen
with
little
pleasure
these
frequent
attendances
at
the
parish
church
it
was
not
because
his
own
moral
condition
was
not
undergoing
change
sorrow
is
a
cloud
which
changes
form
robust
natures
as
we
have
said
are
sometimes
almost
overthrown
by
sudden
great
misfortunes
but
not
quite
manly
characters
such
as
lethierry
experience
a
reaction
in
a
given
time
despair
has
its
backward
stages
from
overwhelmment
we
rise
to
dejection
from
dejection
to
affliction
from
affliction
to
melancholy
melancholy
is
a
twilight
state
suffering
melts
into
it
and
becomes
a
sombre
joy
melancholy
is
the
pleasure
of
being
sad
these
elegiac
moods
were
not
made
for
lethierry
neither
the
nature
of
his
temperament
nor
the
character
of
his
misfortune
suited
those
delicate
shades
but
at
the
moment
at
which
we
have
returned
to
him
the
reverie
of
his
first
despair
had
for
more
than
a
week
been
tending
to
disperse
without
however
leaving
him
less
sad
he
was
more
inactive
was
always
dull
but
he
was
no
longer
overwhelmed
a
certain
perception
of
events
and
circumstances
was
returning
to
him
and
he
began
to
experience
something
of
that
phenomenon
which
may
be
called
the
return
to
reality
thus
by
day
in
the
great
lower
room
he
did
not
listen
to
the
words
of
those
about
him
but
he
heard
them
grace
came
one
morning
quite
triumphant
to
tell
déruchette
that
he
had
undone
the
cover
of
a
newspaper
this
half
acceptance
of
realities
is
in
itself
a
good
symptom
a
token
of
convalescence
great
afflictions
produce
a
stupor
it
is
by
such
little
acts
that
men
return
to
themselves
this
improvement
however
is
at
first
only
an
aggravation
of
the
evil
the
dreamy
condition
of
mind
in
which
the
sufferer
has
lived
has
served
while
it
lasted
to
blunt
his
grief
his
sight
before
was
thick
he
felt
little
now
his
view
is
clear
nothing
escapes
him
and
his
wounds
each
detail
that
he
perceives
serves
to
remind
him
of
his
sorrow
he
sees
everything
again
in
memory
every
remembrance
is
a
regret
all
kinds
of
bitter
aftertastes
lurk
in
that
return
to
life
he
is
better
and
yet
worse
such
was
the
condition
of
lethierry
in
returning
to
full
consciousness
his
sufferings
had
become
more
distinct
a
sudden
shock
first
recalled
him
to
a
sense
of
reality
one
afternoon
between
the
and
of
april
a
at
the
door
of
the
great
lower
room
of
the
bravées
had
signalled
the
arrival
of
the
postman
douce
had
opened
the
door
there
was
a
letter
the
letter
came
from
beyond
sea
it
was
addressed
to
mess
lethierry
and
bore
the
postmark
lisbon
douce
had
taken
the
letter
to
mess
lethierry
who
was
in
his
room
he
had
taken
it
placed
it
mechanically
upon
the
table
and
had
not
looked
at
it
the
letter
remained
an
entire
week
upon
the
table
without
being
unsealed
it
happened
however
one
morning
that
douce
said
to
mess
lethierry
shall
i
brush
the
dust
off
your
letter
sir
lethierry
seemed
to
arouse
from
his
lethargy
ay
ay
you
are
right
he
said
and
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
at
sea
to
mess
lethierry
of
sampson
you
will
be
gratified
to
receive
news
of
me
i
am
aboard
the
bound
for
the
port
of
among
the
crew
is
a
sailor
named
from
guernsey
who
will
return
and
will
have
some
facts
to
communicate
to
you
i
take
the
opportunity
of
our
speaking
a
vessel
the
bound
for
lisbon
to
forward
you
this
letter
you
will
be
astonished
to
learn
that
i
am
going
to
be
honest
as
honest
as
sieur
clubin
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
you
know
of
certain
recent
occurrences
nevertheless
it
is
perhaps
not
altogether
superfluous
to
send
you
a
full
account
of
them
to
proceed
then
i
have
returned
you
your
money
some
years
ago
i
borrowed
from
you
under
somewhat
irregular
circumstances
the
sum
of
fifty
thousand
francs
before
leaving
malo
lately
i
placed
in
the
hands
of
your
confidential
man
of
business
sieur
clubin
on
your
account
three
of
one
thousand
pounds
each
making
together
thousand
francs
you
will
no
doubt
find
this
reimbursement
sufficient
sieur
clubin
acted
for
you
and
received
your
money
including
interest
in
a
remarkably
energetic
manner
he
appeared
to
me
indeed
singularly
zealous
this
is
in
fact
my
reason
for
apprising
you
of
the
facts
your
other
confidential
man
of
business
rantaine
sieur
clubin
was
in
possession
of
a
revolver
which
will
explain
to
you
the
circumstance
of
my
having
no
receipt
he
who
has
ever
touched
a
torpedo
or
a
fully
charged
may
have
a
notion
of
the
effect
produced
on
mess
lethierry
by
the
reading
of
this
letter
under
that
envelope
in
that
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
to
which
he
had
at
first
paid
so
little
attention
lay
the
elements
of
an
extraordinary
commotion
he
recognised
the
writing
and
the
signature
as
to
the
facts
which
the
letter
contained
at
first
he
understood
nothing
the
excitement
of
the
event
however
soon
gave
movement
to
his
faculties
the
effective
part
of
the
shock
he
had
received
lay
in
the
phenomenon
of
the
thousand
francs
entrusted
by
rantaine
to
clubin
this
was
a
riddle
which
compelled
lethierry
brain
to
work
conjecture
is
a
healthy
occupation
for
the
mind
reason
is
awakened
logic
is
called
into
play
for
some
time
past
public
opinion
in
guernsey
had
been
undergoing
a
reaction
on
the
subject
of
clubin
that
man
of
such
high
reputation
for
honour
during
many
years
that
man
so
unanimously
regarded
with
esteem
people
had
begun
to
question
and
to
doubt
there
were
wagers
pro
and
con
some
light
had
been
thrown
on
the
question
in
singular
ways
the
figure
of
clubin
began
to
become
clearer
that
is
to
say
he
began
to
be
blacker
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
a
judicial
inquiry
had
taken
place
at
malo
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
what
had
become
of
the
number
legal
perspicacity
had
got
upon
a
false
scent
a
thing
which
happens
not
unfrequently
it
had
started
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
man
had
been
enticed
by
zuela
and
shipped
aboard
the
for
chili
this
ingenious
supposition
had
led
to
a
considerable
amount
of
wasted
conjecture
the
shortsightedness
of
justice
had
failed
to
take
note
of
rantaine
but
in
the
progress
of
inquiry
the
authorities
had
come
upon
other
clues
the
affair
so
obscure
became
complicated
clubin
had
become
mixed
up
with
the
enigma
a
coincidence
perhaps
a
direct
connection
had
been
found
between
the
departure
of
the
and
the
loss
of
the
durande
at
the
near
the
dinan
gate
where
clubin
thought
himself
entirely
unknown
he
had
been
recognised
the
keeper
had
talked
clubin
had
bought
a
bottle
of
brandy
that
night
for
whom
the
gunsmith
of
vincent
street
too
had
talked
clubin
had
purchased
a
revolver
for
what
object
the
landlord
of
the
jean
auberge
had
talked
clubin
had
absented
himself
in
an
inexplicable
manner
captain
had
talked
clubin
had
determined
to
start
although
warned
and
knowing
that
he
might
expect
a
great
fog
the
crew
of
the
durande
had
talked
in
fact
the
collection
of
the
freight
had
been
neglected
and
the
stowage
badly
arranged
a
negligence
easy
to
comprehend
if
the
captain
had
determined
to
wreck
the
ship
the
guernsey
passenger
too
had
spoken
clubin
had
evidently
imagined
that
he
had
run
upon
the
hanways
the
torteval
people
had
spoken
clubin
had
visited
that
neighbourhood
a
few
days
before
the
loss
of
the
durande
and
had
been
seen
walking
in
the
direction
of
pleinmont
near
the
hanways
he
had
with
him
a
he
had
set
out
with
it
and
come
back
without
it
the
had
spoken
their
story
seemed
to
be
possibly
connected
with
clubin
disappearance
if
instead
of
ghosts
they
supposed
smugglers
finally
the
haunted
house
of
pleinmont
itself
had
spoken
persons
who
had
determined
to
get
information
had
climbed
and
entered
the
windows
and
had
found
inside
what
the
very
which
had
been
seen
in
sieur
clubin
possession
the
authorities
of
the
of
torteval
had
taken
possession
of
the
bag
and
had
it
opened
it
was
found
to
contain
provisions
a
telescope
a
chronometer
a
man
clothing
and
linen
marked
with
clubin
initials
all
this
in
the
gossip
of
malo
and
guernsey
became
more
and
more
like
a
case
of
fraud
obscure
hints
were
brought
together
there
appeared
to
have
been
a
singular
disregard
of
advice
a
willingness
to
encounter
the
dangers
of
the
fog
a
suspected
negligence
in
the
stowage
of
the
cargo
then
there
was
the
mysterious
bottle
of
brandy
a
drunken
helmsman
a
substitution
of
the
captain
for
the
helmsman
a
management
of
the
rudder
to
say
the
least
unskilful
the
heroism
of
remaining
behind
upon
the
wreck
began
to
look
like
roguery
clubin
besides
had
evidently
been
deceived
as
to
the
rock
he
was
on
granted
an
intention
to
wreck
the
vessel
it
was
easy
to
understand
the
choice
of
the
hanways
the
shore
easily
reached
by
swimming
and
the
intended
concealment
in
the
haunted
house
awaiting
the
opportunity
for
flight
the
that
suspicious
preparative
completed
the
demonstration
by
what
link
this
affair
connected
itself
with
the
other
affair
of
the
disappearance
of
the
nobody
knew
people
imagined
some
connection
and
that
was
all
they
had
a
glimpse
in
their
minds
of
the
number
alongside
of
the
mysterious
clubin
quite
a
tragic
drama
clubin
possibly
was
not
an
actor
in
it
but
his
presence
was
visible
in
the
side
scenes
the
supposition
of
a
wilful
destruction
of
the
durande
did
not
explain
everything
there
was
a
revolver
in
the
story
with
no
part
yet
assigned
to
it
the
revolver
probably
belonged
to
the
other
affair
the
scent
of
the
public
is
keen
and
true
its
instinct
excels
in
those
discoveries
of
truth
by
pieces
and
fragments
still
amidst
these
facts
which
seemed
to
point
pretty
clearly
to
a
case
of
barratry
there
were
serious
difficulties
everything
was
consistent
everything
coherent
but
a
basis
was
wanting
people
do
not
wreck
vessels
for
the
pleasure
of
wrecking
them
men
do
not
run
all
those
risks
of
fog
rocks
swimming
concealment
and
flight
without
an
interest
what
could
have
been
clubin
interest
the
act
seemed
plain
but
the
motive
was
puzzling
hence
a
doubt
in
many
minds
where
there
is
no
motive
it
is
natural
to
infer
that
there
was
no
act
the
missing
link
was
important
the
letter
from
rantaine
seemed
to
supply
it
this
letter
furnished
a
motive
for
clubin
supposed
crime
thousand
francs
to
be
appropriated
rantaine
was
the
ex
he
had
descended
from
the
clouds
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
his
letter
was
the
final
light
upon
the
affair
it
explained
everything
and
even
promised
a
witness
in
the
person
of
the
part
which
it
at
once
suggested
for
the
revolver
was
decisive
rantaine
was
undoubtedly
well
informed
his
letter
pointed
clearly
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
there
could
be
no
possible
palliation
of
clubin
crime
he
had
premeditated
the
shipwreck
the
proofs
were
the
preparations
discovered
in
the
haunted
house
even
supposing
him
innocent
and
admitting
the
wreck
to
have
been
accidental
would
he
not
at
the
last
moment
when
he
had
determined
to
sacrifice
himself
with
the
vessel
have
entrusted
the
thousand
francs
to
the
men
who
escaped
in
the
the
evidence
was
strikingly
complete
now
what
had
become
of
clubin
he
had
probably
been
the
victim
of
his
blunder
he
had
doubtless
perished
upon
the
douvres
all
this
construction
of
surmises
which
were
not
far
from
the
reality
had
for
several
days
occupied
the
mind
of
mess
lethierry
the
letter
from
rantaine
had
done
him
the
service
of
setting
him
to
think
he
was
at
first
shaken
by
his
surprise
then
he
made
an
effort
to
reflect
he
made
another
effort
more
difficult
still
that
of
inquiry
he
was
induced
to
listen
and
even
seek
conversation
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
had
become
to
a
certain
degree
in
the
world
again
his
thoughts
had
regained
their
coherence
and
he
was
almost
restored
he
had
emerged
from
his
confused
and
troubled
state
rantaine
letter
even
admitting
that
mess
lethierry
could
ever
have
entertained
any
hope
of
the
reimbursement
of
his
money
destroyed
that
last
chance
it
added
to
the
catastrophe
of
the
durande
this
new
wreck
of
thousand
francs
it
put
him
in
possession
of
that
amount
just
so
far
as
to
make
him
sensible
of
its
loss
the
letter
revealed
to
him
the
extreme
point
in
his
ruin
hence
he
experienced
a
new
and
very
painful
sensation
which
we
have
already
spoken
of
he
began
to
take
an
interest
in
his
household
what
it
was
to
be
in
the
future
how
he
was
to
set
things
in
order
matters
of
which
he
had
taken
no
heed
for
two
months
past
these
trifling
cares
wounded
him
with
a
thousand
tiny
points
worse
in
their
aggregate
than
the
old
despair
a
sorrow
is
doubly
burdensome
which
has
to
be
endured
in
each
item
and
while
disputing
inch
by
inch
with
fate
for
ground
already
lost
ruin
is
endurable
in
the
mass
but
not
in
the
dust
and
fragments
of
the
fallen
edifice
the
great
fact
may
overwhelm
but
the
details
torture
the
catastrophe
which
lately
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
becomes
now
a
cruel
persecution
humiliation
comes
to
aggravate
the
blow
a
second
desolation
succeeds
the
first
with
features
more
repulsive
you
descend
one
degree
nearer
to
annihilation
the
becomes
changed
to
sordid
rags
no
thought
is
more
bitter
than
that
of
one
own
gradual
fall
from
a
social
position
ruin
is
simple
enough
a
violent
shock
a
cruel
turn
of
fate
a
catastrophe
once
for
all
be
it
so
we
submit
and
all
is
over
you
are
ruined
it
is
well
you
are
dead
no
you
are
still
living
on
the
morrow
you
know
it
well
by
what
by
the
pricking
of
a
pin
yonder
omits
to
recognise
you
the
tradesmen
bills
rain
down
upon
you
and
yonder
is
one
of
your
enemies
who
is
smiling
perhaps
he
is
thinking
of
arnal
last
pun
but
it
is
all
the
same
the
pun
would
not
have
appeared
to
him
so
inimitable
but
for
your
ruin
you
read
your
own
sudden
insignificance
even
in
looks
of
indifference
friends
who
used
to
dine
at
your
table
become
of
opinion
that
three
courses
were
an
extravagance
your
faults
are
patent
to
the
eyes
of
everybody
ingratitude
having
nothing
more
to
expect
proclaims
itself
openly
every
idiot
has
foreseen
your
misfortunes
the
malignant
pull
you
to
pieces
the
more
malignant
profess
to
pity
and
then
come
a
hundred
paltry
details
nausea
succeeds
to
grief
you
have
been
wont
to
indulge
in
wine
you
must
now
drink
cider
two
servants
too
why
one
will
be
too
many
it
will
be
necessary
to
discharge
this
one
and
get
rid
of
that
flowers
in
your
garden
are
superfluous
you
will
plant
it
with
potatoes
you
used
to
make
presents
of
your
fruits
to
friends
you
will
send
them
henceforth
to
market
as
to
the
poor
it
will
be
absurd
to
think
of
giving
anything
to
them
are
you
not
poor
yourself
and
then
there
is
the
painful
question
of
dress
to
have
to
refuse
a
wife
a
new
ribbon
what
a
torture
to
have
to
refuse
one
who
has
made
you
a
gift
of
her
beauty
a
trifling
article
to
haggle
over
such
matters
like
a
miser
perhaps
she
will
say
to
you
what
rob
my
garden
of
its
flowers
and
now
refuse
one
for
my
bonnet
ah
me
to
have
to
condemn
her
to
shabby
dresses
the
family
table
is
silent
you
fancy
that
those
around
it
think
harshly
of
you
beloved
faces
have
become
clouded
this
is
what
is
meant
by
falling
fortunes
it
is
to
die
day
by
day
to
be
struck
down
is
like
the
blast
of
the
furnace
to
decay
like
this
is
the
torture
of
the
slow
fire
an
overwhelming
blow
is
a
sort
of
waterloo
a
slow
decay
a
helena
destiny
incarnate
in
the
form
of
wellington
has
still
some
dignity
but
how
sordid
in
the
shape
of
hudson
lowe
fate
becomes
then
a
paltry
huckster
we
find
the
man
of
campo
formio
quarrelling
about
a
pair
of
stockings
we
see
that
dwarfing
of
napoleon
which
makes
england
less
waterloo
and
helena
reduced
to
humbler
proportions
every
ruined
man
has
traversed
those
two
phases
on
the
evening
we
have
mentioned
and
which
was
one
of
the
first
evenings
in
may
lethierry
leaving
déruchette
to
walk
by
moonlight
in
the
garden
had
gone
to
bed
more
depressed
than
ever
all
these
mean
and
repulsive
details
peculiar
to
worldly
misfortune
all
these
trifling
cares
which
are
at
first
insipid
and
afterwards
harassing
were
revolving
in
his
mind
a
sullen
load
of
miseries
mess
lethierry
felt
that
his
fall
was
irremediable
what
could
he
do
what
would
become
of
them
what
sacrifices
should
he
be
compelled
to
impose
on
déruchette
whom
should
he
discharge
douce
or
grace
would
they
have
to
sell
the
bravées
would
they
not
be
compelled
to
leave
the
island
to
be
nothing
where
he
had
been
everything
it
was
a
terrible
fall
indeed
and
to
know
that
the
old
times
had
gone
for
ever
to
recall
those
journeys
to
and
fro
uniting
france
with
those
numberless
islands
the
tuesday
departure
the
friday
return
the
crowd
on
the
quay
those
great
cargoes
that
industry
that
prosperity
that
proud
direct
navigation
that
machinery
embodying
the
will
of
man
that
boiler
that
smoke
all
that
reality
the
steamboat
had
been
the
final
crown
of
the
compass
the
needle
indicating
the
direct
track
the
following
it
one
proposing
the
other
executing
where
was
she
now
his
durande
that
mistress
of
the
seas
that
queen
who
had
made
him
a
king
to
have
been
so
long
the
man
of
ideas
in
his
own
country
the
man
of
success
the
man
who
revolutionised
navigation
and
then
to
have
to
give
up
all
to
abdicate
to
cease
to
exist
to
become
a
an
empty
bag
which
once
was
full
to
belong
to
the
past
after
having
so
long
represented
the
future
to
come
down
to
be
an
object
of
pity
to
fools
to
witness
the
triumph
of
routine
obstinacy
conservatism
selfishness
ignorance
to
see
the
old
barbarous
sailing
cutters
crawling
to
and
fro
upon
the
sea
the
outworn
prejudices
young
again
to
have
wasted
a
whole
life
to
have
been
a
light
and
to
suffer
this
eclipse
ah
what
a
sight
it
was
upon
the
waves
that
noble
funnel
that
prodigious
cylinder
that
pillar
with
its
capital
of
smoke
that
column
grander
than
any
in
the
place
vendôme
for
on
that
there
was
only
a
man
while
on
this
stood
progress
the
ocean
was
subdued
it
was
certainty
upon
the
open
sea
and
had
all
this
been
witnessed
in
that
little
island
in
that
little
harbour
in
that
little
town
of
sampson
yes
it
had
been
witnessed
and
could
it
be
that
having
seen
it
all
had
vanished
to
be
seen
no
more
all
this
series
of
regrets
tortured
lethierry
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
mental
sobbing
never
perhaps
had
he
felt
his
misfortune
more
bitterly
a
certain
numbness
follows
this
acute
suffering
under
the
weight
of
his
sorrow
he
gradually
dosed
for
about
two
hours
he
remained
in
this
state
feverish
sleeping
a
little
meditating
much
such
torpors
are
accompanied
by
an
obscure
labour
of
the
brain
which
is
inexpressibly
wearying
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
about
midnight
a
little
before
or
a
little
after
he
shook
off
his
lethargy
he
aroused
and
opened
his
eyes
his
window
was
directly
in
front
of
his
hammock
he
saw
something
extraordinary
a
form
was
before
the
window
a
marvellous
form
it
was
the
funnel
of
a
mess
lethierry
started
and
sat
upright
in
his
bed
the
hammock
oscillated
like
a
swing
in
a
tempest
lethierry
stared
a
vision
filled
the
there
was
the
harbour
flooded
with
the
light
of
the
moon
and
against
that
glitter
quite
close
to
his
house
stood
forth
tall
round
and
black
a
magnificent
object
the
funnel
of
a
was
there
lethierry
sprang
out
of
his
hammock
ran
to
the
window
lifted
the
sash
leaned
out
and
recognised
it
the
funnel
of
the
durande
stood
before
him
it
was
in
the
old
place
its
four
chains
supported
it
made
fast
to
the
bulwarks
of
a
vessel
in
which
beneath
the
funnel
he
could
distinguish
a
dark
mass
of
irregular
outline
lethierry
recoiled
turned
his
back
to
the
window
and
dropped
in
a
sitting
posture
into
his
hammock
again
then
he
returned
and
once
more
he
saw
the
vision
an
instant
afterwards
or
in
about
the
time
occupied
by
a
flash
of
lightning
he
was
out
upon
the
quay
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
a
bark
carrying
a
little
backward
a
massive
block
from
which
issued
the
straight
funnel
before
the
window
of
the
bravées
was
made
fast
to
the
of
the
durande
the
bows
of
the
bark
stretched
beyond
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
the
house
and
were
level
with
the
quay
there
was
no
one
aboard
the
vessel
was
of
a
peculiar
shape
all
guernsey
would
have
recognised
it
it
was
the
old
dutch
sloop
lethierry
jumped
aboard
and
ran
forward
to
the
block
which
he
saw
beyond
the
mast
it
was
there
entire
complete
intact
standing
square
and
firm
upon
its
flooring
the
boiler
had
all
its
rivets
the
axle
of
the
was
raised
erect
and
made
fast
near
the
boiler
the
was
in
its
place
nothing
was
wanting
lethierry
examined
the
machinery
the
lantern
and
the
moon
helped
him
in
his
examination
he
went
over
every
part
of
the
mechanism
he
noticed
the
two
cases
at
the
sides
he
examined
the
axle
of
the
wheels
he
went
into
the
little
cabin
it
was
empty
he
returned
to
the
engine
and
felt
it
looked
into
the
boiler
and
knelt
down
to
examine
it
inside
he
placed
his
lantern
within
the
furnace
where
the
light
illuminating
all
the
machinery
produced
almost
the
illusion
of
an
with
its
fire
then
he
burst
into
a
wild
laugh
sprang
to
his
feet
and
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
engine
and
his
arms
outstretched
towards
the
funnel
he
cried
aloud
help
the
harbour
bell
was
upon
the
quay
at
a
few
paces
distance
he
ran
to
it
seized
the
chain
and
began
to
pull
it
violently
ii
the
harbour
bell
again
gilliatt
in
fact
after
a
passage
without
accident
but
somewhat
slow
on
account
of
the
heavy
burden
of
the
sloop
had
arrived
at
sampson
after
dark
and
nearer
ten
than
nine
he
had
calculated
the
time
the
had
arrived
there
was
plenty
of
water
and
the
moon
was
shining
so
that
he
was
able
to
enter
the
port
the
little
harbour
was
silent
a
few
vessels
were
moored
there
with
their
sails
brailed
up
to
the
yards
their
tops
over
and
without
lanterns
at
the
far
end
a
few
others
were
visible
high
and
dry
in
the
careenage
where
they
were
undergoing
repairs
large
hulls
dismasted
and
stripped
with
their
planking
open
at
various
parts
lifting
high
the
ends
of
their
timbers
and
looking
like
huge
dead
beetles
lying
on
their
backs
with
their
legs
in
the
air
as
soon
as
he
had
cleared
the
harbour
mouth
gilliatt
examined
the
port
and
the
quay
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
either
at
the
bravées
or
elsewhere
the
place
was
deserted
save
perhaps
by
some
one
going
to
or
returning
from
the
nor
was
it
possible
to
be
sure
even
of
this
for
the
night
blurred
every
outline
and
the
moonlight
always
gives
to
objects
a
vague
appearance
the
distance
added
to
the
indistinctness
the
at
that
period
was
situated
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
where
there
stands
at
the
present
day
an
open
gilliatt
had
approached
the
bravées
quietly
and
had
made
the
sloop
fast
to
the
ring
of
the
durande
under
mess
lethierry
window
he
leaped
over
the
bulwarks
and
was
ashore
leaving
the
sloop
behind
him
by
the
quay
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
house
passed
along
a
little
narrow
street
then
along
another
did
not
even
notice
the
pathway
which
branched
off
leading
to
the
bû
de
la
rue
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
himself
at
that
corner
of
the
wall
where
there
were
wild
mallows
with
pink
flowers
in
june
with
holly
ivy
and
nettles
many
a
time
concealed
behind
the
bushes
seated
on
a
stone
in
the
summer
days
he
had
watched
here
through
long
hours
even
for
whole
months
often
tempted
to
climb
the
wall
over
which
he
contemplated
the
garden
of
the
bravées
and
the
two
windows
of
a
little
room
seen
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
stone
was
there
still
the
bushes
the
low
wall
the
angle
as
quiet
and
dark
as
ever
like
an
animal
returning
to
its
hole
gliding
rather
than
walking
he
made
his
way
in
once
seated
there
he
made
no
movement
he
looked
around
saw
again
the
garden
the
pathways
the
beds
of
flowers
the
house
the
two
windows
of
the
chamber
the
moonlight
fell
upon
this
dream
he
felt
it
horrible
to
be
compelled
to
breathe
and
did
what
he
could
to
prevent
it
he
seemed
to
be
gazing
on
a
vision
of
paradise
and
was
afraid
that
all
would
vanish
it
was
almost
impossible
that
all
these
things
could
be
really
before
his
eyes
and
if
they
were
it
could
only
be
with
that
imminent
danger
of
melting
into
air
which
belongs
to
things
divine
a
breath
and
all
must
be
dissipated
he
trembled
with
the
thought
before
him
not
far
off
at
the
side
of
one
of
the
alleys
in
the
garden
was
a
wooden
seat
painted
green
the
reader
will
remember
this
seat
gilliatt
looked
up
at
the
two
windows
he
thought
of
the
slumber
of
some
one
possibly
in
that
room
behind
that
wall
she
was
no
doubt
sleeping
he
wished
himself
elsewhere
yet
would
sooner
have
died
than
go
away
he
thought
of
a
gentle
breathing
moving
a
woman
breast
it
was
she
that
vision
that
purity
in
the
clouds
that
form
haunting
him
by
day
and
night
she
was
there
he
thought
of
her
so
far
removed
and
yet
so
near
as
to
be
almost
within
reach
of
his
delight
he
thought
of
that
impossible
ideal
drooping
in
slumber
and
like
himself
too
visited
by
visions
of
that
being
so
long
desired
so
distant
so
impalpable
her
closed
eyelids
her
face
resting
on
her
hand
of
the
mystery
of
sleep
in
its
relations
with
that
pure
spirit
of
what
dreams
might
come
to
one
who
was
herself
a
dream
he
dared
not
think
beyond
and
yet
he
did
he
ventured
on
those
familiarities
which
the
fancy
may
indulge
in
the
notion
of
how
much
was
feminine
in
that
angelic
being
disturbed
his
thoughts
the
darkness
of
night
emboldens
timid
imaginations
to
take
these
furtive
glances
he
was
vexed
within
himself
feeling
on
reflection
as
if
it
were
profanity
to
think
of
her
so
boldly
yet
still
constrained
in
spite
of
himself
he
tremblingly
gazed
into
the
invisible
he
shuddered
almost
with
a
sense
of
pain
as
he
imagined
her
room
a
petticoat
on
a
chair
a
mantle
fallen
on
the
carpet
a
band
unbuckled
a
handkerchief
he
imagined
her
corset
with
its
lace
hanging
to
the
ground
her
stockings
her
boots
his
soul
was
among
the
stars
the
stars
are
made
for
the
human
heart
of
a
poor
man
like
gilliatt
not
less
than
for
that
of
the
rich
and
great
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
passion
by
which
every
man
becomes
wrapped
in
a
celestial
light
with
a
rough
and
primitive
nature
this
truth
is
even
more
applicable
an
uncultivated
mind
is
easily
touched
with
dreams
delight
is
a
fulness
which
overflows
like
any
other
to
see
those
windows
was
almost
too
much
happiness
for
gilliatt
suddenly
he
looked
and
saw
her
from
the
branches
of
a
clump
of
bushes
already
thickened
by
the
spring
there
issued
with
a
spectral
slowness
a
celestial
figure
a
dress
a
divine
face
almost
a
shining
light
beneath
the
moon
gilliatt
felt
his
powers
failing
him
it
was
déruchette
déruchette
approached
she
stopped
she
walked
back
a
few
paces
stopped
again
then
returned
and
sat
upon
the
wooden
bench
the
moon
was
in
the
trees
a
few
clouds
floated
among
the
pale
stars
the
sea
murmured
to
the
shadows
in
an
undertone
the
town
was
sleeping
a
thin
haze
was
rising
from
the
horizon
the
melancholy
was
profound
déruchette
inclined
her
head
with
those
thoughtful
eyes
which
look
attentive
yet
see
nothing
she
was
seated
sideways
and
had
nothing
on
her
head
but
a
little
cap
untied
which
showed
upon
her
delicate
neck
the
commencement
of
her
hair
she
twirled
mechanically
a
ribbon
of
her
cap
around
one
of
her
fingers
the
half
light
showed
the
outline
of
her
hands
like
those
of
a
statue
her
dress
was
of
one
of
those
shades
which
by
night
looked
white
the
trees
stirred
as
if
they
felt
the
enchantment
which
she
shed
around
her
the
tip
of
one
of
her
feet
was
visible
her
lowered
eyelids
had
that
vague
contraction
which
suggests
a
tear
checked
in
its
course
or
a
thought
suppressed
there
was
a
charming
indecision
in
the
movements
of
her
arms
which
had
no
support
to
lean
on
a
sort
of
floating
mingled
with
every
posture
it
was
rather
a
gleam
than
a
light
rather
a
grace
than
a
goddess
the
folds
of
her
dress
were
exquisite
her
face
which
might
inspire
adoration
seemed
meditative
like
portraits
of
the
virgin
it
was
terrible
to
think
how
near
she
was
gilliatt
could
hear
her
breathe
a
nightingale
was
singing
in
the
distance
the
stirring
of
the
wind
among
the
branches
set
in
movement
the
inexpressible
silence
of
the
night
déruchette
beautiful
divine
appeared
in
the
twilight
like
a
creation
from
those
rays
and
from
the
perfumes
in
the
air
that
widespread
enchantment
seemed
to
concentre
and
embody
itself
mysteriously
in
her
she
became
its
living
manifestation
she
seemed
the
outblossoming
of
all
that
shadow
and
silence
but
the
shadow
and
silence
which
floated
lightly
about
her
weighed
heavily
on
gilliatt
he
was
bewildered
what
he
experienced
is
not
to
be
told
in
words
emotion
is
always
new
and
the
word
is
always
enough
hence
the
impossibility
of
expressing
it
joy
is
sometimes
overwhelming
to
see
déruchette
to
see
herself
to
see
her
dress
her
cap
her
ribbon
which
she
twined
around
her
finger
was
it
possible
to
imagine
it
was
it
possible
to
be
thus
near
her
to
hear
her
breathe
she
breathed
then
the
stars
might
breathe
also
gilliatt
felt
a
thrill
through
him
he
was
the
most
miserable
and
yet
the
happiest
of
men
he
knew
not
what
to
do
his
delirious
joy
at
seeing
her
annihilated
him
was
it
indeed
déruchette
there
and
he
so
near
his
thoughts
bewildered
and
yet
fixed
were
fascinated
by
that
figure
as
by
a
dazzling
jewel
he
gazed
upon
her
neck
her
hair
he
did
not
even
say
to
himself
that
all
that
would
now
belong
to
him
that
before
long
perhaps
he
would
have
the
right
to
take
off
that
cap
to
unknot
that
ribbon
he
would
not
have
conceived
for
a
moment
the
audacity
of
thinking
even
so
far
touching
in
idea
is
almost
like
touching
with
the
hand
love
was
with
gilliatt
like
honey
to
the
bear
he
thought
confusedly
he
knew
not
what
possessed
him
the
nightingale
still
sang
he
felt
as
if
about
to
breathe
his
life
out
the
idea
of
rising
of
jumping
over
the
wall
of
speaking
to
déruchette
never
came
into
his
mind
if
it
had
he
would
have
turned
and
fled
if
anything
resembling
a
thought
had
begun
to
dawn
in
his
mind
it
was
this
that
déruchette
was
there
that
he
wanted
nothing
more
and
that
eternity
had
begun
a
noise
aroused
them
both
her
from
her
reverie
him
from
his
ecstasy
some
one
was
walking
in
the
garden
it
was
not
possible
to
see
who
was
approaching
on
account
of
the
trees
it
was
the
footstep
of
a
man
déruchette
raised
her
eyes
the
steps
drew
nearer
then
ceased
the
person
walking
had
stopped
he
must
have
been
quite
near
the
path
beside
which
was
the
bench
wound
between
two
clumps
of
trees
the
stranger
was
there
in
the
alley
between
the
trees
at
a
few
paces
from
the
seat
accident
had
so
placed
the
branches
that
déruchette
could
see
the
newcomer
while
gilliatt
could
not
the
moon
cast
on
the
ground
beyond
the
trees
a
shadow
which
reached
to
the
garden
seat
gilliatt
could
see
this
shadow
he
looked
at
déruchette
she
was
quite
pale
her
mouth
was
partly
open
as
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
surprise
she
had
just
half
risen
from
the
bench
and
sunk
again
upon
it
there
was
in
her
attitude
a
mixture
of
fascination
with
a
desire
to
fly
her
surprise
was
enchantment
mingled
with
timidity
she
had
upon
her
lips
almost
the
light
of
a
smile
with
the
fulness
of
tears
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
as
if
transfigured
by
that
presence
as
if
the
being
whom
she
saw
before
her
belonged
not
to
this
earth
the
reflection
of
an
angel
was
in
her
look
the
stranger
who
was
to
gilliatt
only
a
shadow
spoke
a
voice
issued
from
the
trees
softer
than
the
voice
of
a
woman
yet
it
was
the
voice
of
a
man
gilliatt
heard
these
words
i
see
you
mademoiselle
every
sunday
and
every
thursday
they
tell
me
that
once
you
used
not
to
come
so
often
it
is
a
remark
that
has
been
made
i
ask
your
pardon
i
have
never
spoken
to
you
it
was
my
duty
but
i
come
to
speak
to
you
for
it
is
still
my
duty
it
is
right
that
i
speak
to
you
first
the
sails
this
is
why
i
have
come
you
walk
every
evening
in
your
garden
it
would
be
wrong
of
me
to
know
your
habits
so
well
if
i
had
not
the
thought
that
i
have
mademoiselle
you
are
poor
since
this
morning
i
am
rich
will
you
have
me
for
your
husband
déruchette
joined
her
two
hands
in
a
suppliant
attitude
and
looked
at
the
speaker
silent
with
fixed
eyes
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
the
voice
continued
i
love
you
god
made
not
the
heart
of
man
to
be
silent
he
has
promised
him
eternity
with
the
intention
that
he
should
not
be
alone
there
is
for
me
but
one
woman
upon
earth
it
is
you
i
think
of
you
as
of
a
prayer
my
faith
is
in
god
and
my
hope
in
you
what
wings
i
have
you
bear
you
are
my
life
and
already
my
supreme
happiness
sir
said
déruchette
there
is
no
one
to
answer
in
the
house
the
voice
rose
again
yes
i
have
encouraged
that
dream
heaven
has
not
forbidden
us
to
dream
you
are
like
a
glory
in
my
eyes
i
love
you
deeply
mademoiselle
to
me
you
are
holy
innocence
i
know
it
is
the
hour
at
which
your
household
have
retired
to
rest
but
i
had
no
choice
of
any
other
moment
do
you
remember
that
passage
of
the
bible
which
some
one
read
before
us
it
was
the
chapter
of
genesis
i
have
thought
of
it
often
since
hérode
said
to
me
you
must
have
a
rich
wife
i
replied
no
i
must
have
a
poor
wife
i
speak
to
you
mademoiselle
without
venturing
to
approach
you
i
would
step
even
further
back
if
it
was
your
wish
that
my
shadow
should
not
touch
your
feet
you
alone
are
supreme
you
will
come
to
me
if
such
is
your
will
i
love
and
wait
you
are
the
living
form
of
a
benediction
i
did
not
know
sir
stammered
déruchette
that
any
one
remarked
me
on
sundays
and
thursdays
the
voice
continued
we
are
powerless
against
celestial
things
the
whole
law
is
love
marriage
is
canaan
you
are
to
me
the
promised
land
of
beauty
déruchette
replied
i
did
not
think
i
did
wrong
any
more
than
other
persons
who
are
strict
the
voice
continued
god
manifests
his
will
in
the
flowers
in
the
light
of
dawn
in
the
spring
and
love
is
of
his
ordaining
you
are
beautiful
in
this
holy
shadow
of
night
this
garden
has
been
tended
by
you
in
its
perfumes
there
is
something
of
your
breath
the
affinities
of
our
souls
do
not
depend
on
us
they
can
not
be
counted
with
our
sins
you
were
there
that
was
all
i
was
there
that
was
all
i
did
nothing
but
feel
that
i
loved
you
sometimes
my
eyes
rested
upon
you
i
was
wrong
but
what
could
i
do
it
was
through
looking
at
you
that
all
happened
i
could
not
restrain
my
gaze
there
are
mysterious
impulses
which
are
above
our
search
the
heart
is
the
chief
of
all
temples
to
have
your
spirit
in
my
house
this
is
the
terrestrial
paradise
for
which
i
hope
say
will
you
be
mine
as
long
as
i
was
poor
i
spoke
not
i
know
your
age
you
are
i
am
i
go
if
you
refuse
me
i
return
no
more
oh
be
my
betrothed
will
you
not
more
than
once
have
my
eyes
in
spite
of
myself
addressed
to
you
that
question
i
love
you
answer
me
i
will
speak
to
your
uncle
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
receive
me
but
i
turn
first
to
you
to
rebecca
i
plead
for
rebecca
unless
you
love
me
not
déruchette
hung
her
head
and
murmured
oh
i
worship
him
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
voice
so
low
that
only
gilliatt
heard
them
she
remained
with
her
head
lowered
as
if
by
shading
her
face
she
hoped
to
conceal
her
thoughts
there
was
a
pause
no
leaf
among
the
trees
was
stirred
it
was
that
solemn
and
peaceful
moment
when
the
slumber
of
external
things
mingles
with
the
sleep
of
living
creatures
and
night
seems
to
listen
to
the
beating
of
nature
heart
in
the
midst
of
that
retirement
like
a
harmony
making
the
silence
more
complete
rose
the
wide
murmur
of
the
sea
the
voice
was
heard
again
mademoiselle
déruchette
started
again
the
voice
spoke
you
are
silent
what
would
you
have
me
say
i
wait
for
your
reply
god
has
heard
it
said
déruchette
then
the
voice
became
almost
sonorous
and
at
the
same
time
softer
than
before
and
these
words
issued
from
the
leaves
as
from
a
burning
bush
you
are
my
betrothed
come
then
to
me
let
the
blue
sky
with
all
its
stars
be
witness
of
this
taking
of
my
soul
to
thine
and
let
our
first
embrace
be
mingled
with
that
firmament
déruchette
arose
and
remained
an
instant
motionless
looking
straight
before
her
doubtless
in
another
eyes
then
with
slow
steps
with
head
erect
her
arms
drooping
but
with
the
fingers
of
her
hands
wide
apart
like
one
who
leans
on
some
unseen
support
she
advanced
towards
the
trees
and
was
out
of
sight
a
moment
afterwards
instead
of
the
one
shadow
upon
the
gravelled
walk
there
were
two
they
mingled
together
gilliatt
saw
at
his
feet
the
embrace
of
those
two
shadows
in
certain
moments
of
crisis
time
flows
from
us
as
his
sands
from
the
and
we
have
no
feeling
of
his
flight
that
pair
on
the
one
hand
who
were
ignorant
of
the
presence
of
a
witness
and
saw
him
not
on
the
other
that
witness
of
their
joy
who
could
not
see
them
but
who
knew
of
their
presence
how
many
minutes
did
they
remain
thus
in
that
mysterious
suspension
of
themselves
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
suddenly
a
noise
burst
forth
at
a
distance
a
voice
was
heard
crying
help
and
the
harbour
bell
began
to
sound
it
is
probable
that
in
those
celestial
transports
of
delight
they
heard
no
echo
of
that
tumult
the
bell
continued
to
ring
any
one
who
had
sought
gilliatt
then
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
would
have
found
him
no
longer
there
book

lethierry
pulled
the
bell
furiously
then
stopped
abruptly
a
man
had
just
turned
the
corner
of
the
quay
it
was
gilliatt
lethierry
ran
towards
him
or
rather
flung
himself
upon
him
seized
his
hand
between
his
own
and
looked
him
in
the
face
for
a
moment
silent
it
was
the
silence
of
an
explosion
struggling
to
find
an
issue
then
pulling
and
shaking
him
with
violence
and
squeezing
him
in
his
arms
he
compelled
him
to
enter
the
lower
room
of
the
bravées
pushed
back
with
his
heel
the
door
which
had
remained
half
opened
sat
down
or
sank
into
a
chair
beside
a
great
table
lighted
by
the
moon
the
reflection
of
which
gave
a
vague
pallor
to
gilliatt
face
and
with
a
voice
of
intermingled
laughter
and
tears
cried
ah
my
son
my
player
of
the
bagpipe
i
knew
well
that
it
was
you
the
sloop
tell
me
the
story
you
went
there
then
why
they
would
have
burnt
you
a
hundred
years
ago
it
is
magic
there
is
a
screw
missing
i
have
looked
at
everything
already
recognised
everything
handled
everything
i
guessed
that
the
paddles
were
in
the
two
cases
and
here
you
are
once
more
i
have
been
looking
for
you
in
the
little
cabin
i
rang
the
bell
i
was
seeking
for
you
i
said
to
myself
is
he
that
i
may
devour
him
you
must
admit
that
wonderful
things
do
come
to
pass
he
has
brought
back
life
to
me
you
are
an
angel
yes
yes
it
is
my
engine
nobody
will
believe
it
people
will
see
it
and
say
ca
be
true

a

not
a
pin

the

inch
it
is
incredible
that
there
should
have
been
no
more
damage
we
have
only
to
put
a
little
oil
but
how
did
you
accomplish
it
to
think
that
the
durande
will
be
moving
again
the
axle
of
the
wheels
must
have
been
taken
to
pieces
by
some
watchmaker
give
me
your
word
that
i
am
not
crazy
he
sprang
to
his
feet
breathed
a
moment
and
continued
assure
me
of
that
what
a
revolution
i
pinched
myself
to
be
certain
i
was
not
dreaming
you
are
my
child
you
are
my
son
you
are
my
providence
brave
lad
to
go
and
fetch
my
good
old
engine
in
the
open
sea
among
those
rocks
i
have
seen
some
strange
things
in
my
life
nothing
like
that
i
have
known
parisians
who
were
veritable
demons
but
i
defy
them
to
have
done
that
it
beats
the
bastille
i
have
seen
the
labouring
in
the
with
a
crooked
branch
of
a
tree
for
a
plough
and
a
bundle
of
for
a
harrow
dragged
by
a
leathern
strap
they
get
harvests
of
wheat
that
way
with
grains
as
big
as
hedgenuts
but
that
is
a
trifle
compared
with
your
feats
you
have
performed
a
miracle
a
real
one
ah
let
me
hug
you
how
they
will
gossip
in
sampson
i
shall
set
to
work
at
once
to
build
the
boat

is
astonishing
that
the
crank

all
right

to
the
douvres

say

the
douvres

went
alone

douvres

defy
you

find
a
worse
spot

that
it
proved
that

durande
to
the
bottom
to
swindle

of
money
which
he
had
to
bring
me
he
made
tangrouille
drunk

a
long
story
i
tell
you
another
day
of
his
piratical
tricks

stupid
idiot

confidence
in
clubin
but
he
trapped
himself

villain

he
could
have
got
away

a
god
above
scoundrel

durande

feet

wood
from

and
brême

have
got

machinery

give

now
mess
lethierry
stopped
lifted
his
eyes
with
that
look
which
sees
the
heavens
through
the
roof
and
muttered
yes
there
is
a
power
on
high
then
he
placed
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
between
his
two
eyebrows
and
tapped
with
his
nail
there
an
action
which
indicates
a
project
passing
through
the
mind
and
he
continued
nevertheless
to
begin
again
on
a
grand
scale
a
little
ready
money
would
have
been
useful
ah
if
i
only
had
my
three
the
thousand
francs
that
that
robber
rantaine
returned
and
that
vagabond
clubin
stole
gilliatt
silently
felt
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
something
which
he
placed
before
him
it
was
the
leathern
belt
that
he
had
brought
back
he
opened
and
spread
it
out
upon
the
table
in
the
inside
the
word
clubin
could
be
deciphered
in
the
light
of
the
moon
he
then
took
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
belt
a
box
and
out
of
the
box
three
pieces
of
paper
which
he
unfolded
and
offered
to
lethierry
lethierry
examined
them
it
was
light
enough
to
read
the
figures
and
the
word
thousand
was
also
perfectly
visible
mess
lethierry
took
the
three
notes
placed
them
on
the
table
one
beside
the
other
looked
at
them
looked
at
gilliatt
stood
for
a
moment
dumb
and
then
began
again
like
an
eruption
after
an
explosion
these
too
you
are
a
marvel
my
all
three
a
thousand
pounds
each
my
thousand
francs
why
you
must
have
gone
down
to
the
infernal
regions
it
is
clubin
belt
pardieu
i
can
read
his
vile
name
gilliatt
has
brought
back
engine
and
money
too
there
will
be
something
to
put
in
the
papers
i
will
buy
some
timber
of
the
finest
quality
i
guess
how
it
was
you
found
his
carcase
clubin
mouldering
away
in
some
corner
we
have
some
dantzic
pine
and
brême
oak
we
have
a
planking
oak
within
and
pine
without
in
old
times
they
did
build
so
well
but
their
work
lasted
longer
the
wood
was
better
seasoned
because
they
did
not
build
so
much
build
the
hull
perhaps
of
elm
elm
is
good
for
the
parts
in
the
water
to
be
dry
sometimes
and
sometimes
wet
rots
the
timbers
the
elm
requires
to
be
always
wet
it
a
wood
that
feeds
upon
water
what
a
splendid
durande
we
build
the
lawyers
will
not
trouble
me
again
i
shall
want
no
more
credit
i
have
some
money
of
my
own
did
ever
any
one
see
a
man
like
gilliatt
i
was
struck
down
to
the
ground
i
was
a
dead
man
he
comes
and
sets
me
up
again
as
firm
as
ever
and
all
the
while
i
was
never
thinking
about
him
he
had
gone
clean
out
of
my
mind
but
i
recollect
everything
now
poor
lad
ah
by
the
way
you
know
you
are
to
marry
déruchette
gilliatt
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
wall
like
one
who
staggers
and
said
in
a
tone
very
low
but
distinct
no
mess
lethierry
started
how
no
gilliatt
replied
i
do
not
love
her
mess
lethierry
went
to
the
window
opened
and
reclosed
it
took
the
three
folded
them
placed
the
iron
box
on
top
scratched
his
head
seized
clubin
belt
flung
it
violently
against
the
wall
and
exclaimed
you
must
be
mad
he
thrust
his
fists
into
his
pockets
and
exclaimed
you
do
love
déruchette
what
was
it
at
me
then
that
you
used
to
play
the
bagpipe
gilliatt
still
supporting
himself
by
the
wall
turned
pale
as
a
man
near
his
end
as
he
became
pale
lethierry
became
redder
there
an
idiot
for
you
he
does
love
déruchette
very
good
make
up
your
mind
to
love
her
for
she
shall
never
marry
any
but
you
a
devilish
pretty
story
that
and
you
think
that
i
believe
you
if
there
is
anything
really
the
matter
with
you
send
for
a
doctor
but
talk
nonsense
you
ca
have
had
time
to
quarrel
or
get
out
of
temper
with
her
it
is
true
that
lovers
are
great
fools
sometimes
come
now
what
are
your
reasons
if
you
have
any
say
people
do
make
geese
of
themselves
without
reasons
but
i
have
wool
in
my
ears
perhaps
i
did
understand
repeat
to
me
what
you
said
gilliatt
replied
i
said
no
you
said
no
he
holds
to
it
the
lunatic
you
must
be
crazy
you
said
no
here
a
stupidity
beyond
anything
ever
heard
of
why
people
have
had
their
heads
shaved
for
much
less
than
that
what
you
do
like
déruchette
oh
then
it
was
out
of
affection
for
the
old
man
that
you
did
all
these
things
it
was
for
the
sake
of
papa
that
you
went
to
the
douvres
that
you
endured
cold
and
heat
and
was
half
dead
with
hunger
and
thirst
and
ate
the
limpets
off
the
rocks
and
had
the
fog
the
rain
and
the
wind
for
your
bedroom
and
brought
me
back
my
machine
just
as
you
might
bring
a
pretty
woman
her
little
canary
that
had
escaped
from
its
cage
and
the
tempest
that
we
had
three
days
ago
do
you
think
i
do
bear
it
in
mind
you
must
have
had
a
time
of
it
it
was
in
the
midst
of
all
this
misery
alongside
of
my
old
craft
that
you
shaped
and
cut
and
turned
and
twisted
and
dragged
about
and
filed
and
sawed
and
carpentered
and
schemed
and
performed
more
miracles
there
by
yourself
than
all
the
saints
in
paradise
ah
you
annoyed
me
enough
once
with
your
bagpipe
they
call
it
a
in
brittany
always
the
same
tune
too
silly
fellow
and
yet
you
do
love
déruchette
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
recollect
it
all
now
i
was
there
in
the
corner
déruchette
said
shall
be
my
husband
and
so
you
shall
you
do
love
her
either
you
must
be
mad
or
else
i
am
mad
and
you
stand
there
and
speak
not
a
word
i
tell
you
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
do
all
the
things
you
have
done
and
then
say
after
all
do
love
déruchette
people
do
do
others
services
in
order
to
put
them
in
a
passion
well
if
you
do
marry
her
she
shall
be
single
all
her
life
in
the
first
place
i
shall
want
you
you
must
be
the
pilot
of
the
durande
do
you
imagine
i
mean
to
part
with
you
like
that
no
no
my
brave
boy
i
do
let
you
go
i
have
got
you
now
not
even
listen
to
you
where
will
they
find
a
sailor
like
you
you
are
the
man
i
want
but
why
do
you
speak
meanwhile
the
harbour
bell
had
aroused
the
household
and
the
neighbourhood
douce
and
grace
had
risen
and
had
just
entered
the
lower
room
silent
and
astonished
grace
had
a
candle
in
her
hand
a
group
of
neighbours
townspeople
sailors
and
peasants
who
had
rushed
out
of
their
houses
were
outside
on
the
quay
gazing
in
wonderment
at
the
funnel
of
the
durande
in
the
sloop
some
hearing
lethierry
voice
in
the
lower
room
began
to
glide
in
by
the
door
between
the
faces
of
two
worthy
old
women
appeared
that
of
sieur
landoys
who
had
the
good
fortune
always
to
find
himself
where
he
would
have
regretted
to
have
been
absent
men
feel
a
satisfaction
in
having
witnesses
of
their
joys
the
sort
of
scattered
support
which
a
crowd
presents
pleases
them
at
such
times
their
delight
draws
new
life
from
it
mess
lethierry
suddenly
perceived
that
there
were
persons
about
him
and
he
welcomed
the
audience
at
once
ah
you
are
here
my
friends
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
you
know
the
news
that
man
has
been
there
and
brought
it
back
how
d
do
sieur
landoys
when
i
woke
up
just
now
the
first
thing
i
spied
was
the
funnel
it
was
under
my
window
there
not
a
nail
missing
they
make
pictures
of
napoleon
deeds
but
i
think
more
of
that
than
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
you
have
just
left
your
beds
my
good
friends
the
durande
has
found
you
sleeping
while
you
are
putting
on
your
and
blowing
out
your
candles
there
are
others
working
like
heroes
we
are
a
set
of
cowards
and
we
sit
at
home
rubbing
our
rheumatisms
but
happily
that
does
not
prevent
there
being
some
of
another
stamp
the
man
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
has
arrived
from
the
douvres
rocks
he
has
fished
up
the
durande
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
fished
up
my
money
out
of
clubin
pocket
from
a
greater
depth
still
but
how
did
you
contrive
to
do
it
all
the
powers
of
darkness
were
against
you
the
wind
and
the
sea
the
sea
and
the
wind
it
true
enough
that
you
are
a
magician
those
who
say
that
are
not
so
stupid
after
all
the
durande
is
back
again
the
tempests
may
rage
now
that
cuts
the
ground
from
under
them
my
friends
i
can
inform
you
that

was
no
shipwreck

all

valves

as
easily
as
rollers

would
think
them
made
yesterday

know
that
the
waste
water
is
carried
away
by
a
tube
inside
another
tube
through
which
come
the
waters
from
the
boilers
this
was
to
economise
the
heat
well
the
two
tubes
are
there
as
good
as
ever
the
complete
engine

fact

curious
adventure
i
can
tell
you
you
will
read
about
it
on
saturday
in
old
mauger
malicious
gilliatt
is
very
malicious
what
the
meaning
of
these
here
mess
lethierry
had
just
observed
through
the
opening
of
the
lid
that
there
was
some
gold
in
the
box
upon
the
notes
he
seized
it
opened
and
emptied
it
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
put
the
handful
of
guineas
on
the
table
for
the
poor
sieur
landoys

those
sovereigns
from
me
to
the
constable

oak
and
fir
and
go
to
work
at
carpentering
look
you
do
you
remember
the
weather
of
three
days
ago
what
a
hurricane
of
wind
and
rain
gilliatt
endured
all
that
upon
the
douvres
that
did
prevent
his
taking
the
wreck
to
pieces
as
i
might
take
my
watch
thanks
to
him
i
am
on
my
legs
again
old
galley
is
going
to
run
again
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
with
a
couple
of
wheels
and
a
funnel
i
always
had
that
idea
i
used
to
say
to
myself
one
day
i
will
do
it
that
was
a
good
long
time
back
it
was
an
idea
that
came
in
my
head
at
paris
at
the
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
christine
and
the
rue
dauphine
when
i
was
reading
a
paper
which
had
an
account
of
it
do
you
know
that
gilliatt
would
think
nothing
of
putting
the
machine
at
marly
in
his
pocket
and
walking
about
with
it
he
is
that
man
tempered
steel
a
mariner
of
invaluable
qualities
an
excellent
smith
an
extraordinary
fellow
more
astonishing
than
the
prince
of
hohenlohe
that
is
what
i
call
a
man
with
brains
we
are
children
by
the
side
of
him
we
may
think
ourselves
but
the
is
there
hurrah
for
gilliatt
i
do
not
know
how
he
has
done
it
but
certainly
he
must
have
been
the
devil
and
how
can
i
do
other
than
give
him
déruchette
for
some
minutes
déruchette
had
been
in
the
room
she
had
not
spoken
or
moved
since
she
entered
she
had
glided
in
like
a
shadow
had
sat
down
almost
unperceived
behind
mess
lethierry
who
stood
before
her
loquacious
stormy
joyful
abounding
in
gestures
and
talking
in
a
loud
voice
a
little
while
after
her
another
silent
apparition
had
appeared
a
man
attired
in
black
with
a
white
cravat
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
stood
in
the
doorway
there
were
now
several
candles
among
the
group
which
had
gradually
increased
in
number
these
lights
were
near
the
man
attired
in
black
his
profile
and
youthful
and
pleasing
complexion
showed
itself
against
the
dark
background
with
the
clearness
of
an
engraving
on
a
medal
he
leaned
with
his
shoulder
against
the
framework
of
the
door
and
held
his
left
hand
to
his
forehead
an
attitude
of
unconscious
grace
which
contrasted
the
breadth
of
his
forehead
with
the
smallness
of
his
hand
there
was
an
expression
of
anguish
in
his
contracted
lips
as
he
looked
on
and
listened
with
profound
attention
the
having
recognised
caudray
the
rector
of
the
parish
had
fallen
back
to
allow
him
to
pass
but
he
remained
upon
the
threshold
there
was
hesitation
in
his
posture
but
decision
in
his
looks
which
now
and
then
met
those
of
déruchette
with
regard
to
gilliatt
whether
by
chance
or
design
he
was
in
shadow
and
was
only
perceived
indistinctly
at
first
mess
lethierry
did
not
observe
caudray
but
he
saw
déruchette
he
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
fervently
upon
the
forehead
stretching
forth
his
hand
at
the
same
time
towards
the
dark
corner
where
gilliatt
was
standing
déruchette
he
said
we
are
rich
again
and
there
is
your
future
husband
déruchette
raised
her
head
and
looked
into
the
dusky
corner
bewildered
mess
lethierry
continued
the
marriage
shall
take
place
immediately
if
it
can
they
shall
have
a
licence
the
formalities
here
are
not
very
troublesome
the
dean
can
do
what
he
pleases
people
are
married
before
they
have
time
to
turn
round
it
is
not
as
in
france
where
you
must
have
bans
and
publications
and
delays
and
all
that
fuss
you
will
be
able
to
boast
of
being
the
wife
of
a
brave
man
no
one
can
say
he
is
not
i
thought
so
from
the
day
when
i
saw
him
come
back
from
herm
with
the
little
cannon
but
now
he
comes
back
from
the
douvres
with
his
fortune
and
mine
and
the
fortune
of
this
country
a
man
of
whom
the
world
will
talk
a
great
deal
more
one
day
you
said
once
will
marry
him
and
you
shall
marry
him
and
you
shall
have
little
children
and
i
will
be
grandpapa
and
you
will
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
the
wife
of
a
noble
fellow
who

lethierry

had
just
fallen
upon
caudray
douce
and
grace
had
done
as
they
were
directed
two
candles
placed
upon
the
table
cast
a
light
upon
gilliatt
from
head
to
foot
there
a
fine
fellow
said
mess
lethierry
gilliatt
appearance
was
hideous
he
was
in
the
condition
in
which
he
had
that
morning
set
sail
from
the
rocks
in
rags
his
bare
elbows
showing
through
his
sleeves
his
beard
long
his
hair
rough
and
wild
his
eyes
bloodshot
his
skin
peeling
his
hands
covered
with
wounds
his
feet
naked
some
of
the
blisters
left
by
the
were
still
visible
upon
his
arms
lethierry
gazed
at
him
this
is
my
he
said
how
he
has
struggled
with
the
sea
he
is
all
in
rags
what
shoulders
what
hands
there
a
splendid
fellow
grace
ran
to
déruchette
and
supported
her
head
she
had
fainted
ii
the
leathern
trunk
at
break
of
day
sampson
was
on
foot
and
all
the
people
of
peter
port
began
to
flock
there
the
resurrection
of
the
durande
caused
a
commotion
in
the
island
not
unlike
what
was
caused
by
the
in
the
south
of
france
there
was
a
crowd
on
the
quay
staring
at
the
funnel
standing
erect
in
the
sloop
they
were
anxious
to
see
and
handle
the
machinery
but
lethierry
after
making
a
new
and
triumphant
survey
of
the
whole
by
daylight
had
placed
two
sailors
aboard
with
instructions
to
prevent
any
one
approaching
it
the
funnel
however
furnished
food
enough
for
contemplation
the
crowd
gaped
with
astonishment
they
talked
of
nothing
but
gilliatt
they
remarked
on
his
surname
of
malicious
gilliatt
and
their
admiration
wound
up
with
the
remark
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
people
in
the
island
who
can
do
things
like
that
mess
lethierry
was
seen
from
outside
the
house
seated
at
a
table
before
the
window
writing
with
one
eye
on
the
paper
and
another
on
the
sloop
he
was
so
completely
absorbed
that
he
had
only
once
stopped
to
call
douce
and
ask
after
déruchette
douce
replied
mademoiselle
has
risen
and
is
gone
out
mess
lethierry
replied
she
is
right
to
take
the
air
she
was
a
little
unwell
last
night
owing
to
the
heat
there
was
a
crowd
in
the
room
this
and
her
surprise
and
joy
and
the
windows
being
all
closed
overcame
her
she
will
have
a
husband
to
be
proud
of
and
he
had
gone
on
with
his
writing
he
had
already
finished
and
sealed
two
letters
addressed
to
the
most
important
shipbuilders
at
brême
he
now
finished
the
sealing
of
a
third
the
noise
of
a
wheel
upon
the
quay
induced
him
to
look
up
he
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
observed
coming
from
the
path
which
led
to
the
bû
de
la
rue
a
boy
pushing
a
wheelbarrow
the
boy
was
going
towards
peter
port
in
the
barrow
was
a
portmanteau
of
brown
leather
studded
with
nails
of
brass
and
white
metal
mess
lethierry
called
to
the
boy
where
are
you
going
my
lad
the
boy
stopped
and
replied
to
the
what
for
to
take
this
trunk
aboard

good

shall
take
these
three
letters
too
mess
lethierry
opened
the
drawer
of
his
table
took
a
piece
of
string
tied
the
three
letters
which
he
had
just
written
across
and
across
and
threw
the
packet
to
the
boy
who
caught
it
between
his
hands
tell
the
captain

look

lethierry
at
what
time

twelve
the
tide

flow

noon
she

have
it
against
her
but
she
will

wind
answered
the
lad
boy
said
mess
lethierry
pointing
with
his
forefinger
at
the
engine
in
the
sloop
do
you
see
that
there
is
something
which
laughs
at
winds
and
tides
the
boy
put
the
letters
in
his
pocket
took
up
the
handles
of
the
barrow
again
and
went
on
his
way
towards
the
town
mess
lethierry
called
douce
grace
grace
opened
the
door
a
little
way
what
is
it
mess
come
in
and
wait
a
moment
mess
lethierry
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
began
to
write
if
grace
standing
behind
him
had
been
curious
and
had
leaned
forward
while
he
was
writing
she
might
have
read
as
follows
i
have
written
to
brême
for
the
timber
i
have
appointments
all
the
morning
with
carpenters
for
the
estimate
the
rebuilding
will
go
on
fast
you
must
go
yourself
to
the
deanery
for
a
licence
it
is
my
wish
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
immediately
would
be
better
i
am
busy
about
the
durande
do
you
be
busy
about
déruchette
he
dated
it
and
signed
lethierry
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
seal
it
but
merely
folded
it
in
four
and
handed
it
to
grace
saying
take
that

the
departure
of
the
i
the
havelet
near
the
church
when
there
is
a
crowd
at
sampson
peter
port
is
soon
deserted
a
point
of
curiosity
at
a
given
place
is
like
an
news
travel
fast
in
small
places
going
to
see
the
funnel
of
the
durande
under
mess
lethierry
window
had
been
since
sunrise
the
business
of
the
guernsey
folks
every
other
event
was
eclipsed
by
this
the
death
of
the
dean
of
asaph
was
forgotten
together
with
the
question
of
the
rev
caudray
his
sudden
riches
and
the
departure
of
the
the
machinery
of
the
durande
brought
back
from
the
douvres
rocks
was
the
order
of
the
day
people
were
incredulous
the
shipwreck
had
appeared
extraordinary
the
salvage
seemed
impossible
everybody
hastened
to
assure
himself
of
the
truth
by
the
help
of
his
own
eyes
business
of
every
kind
was
suspended
long
strings
of
townsfolk
with
their
families
from
the
vesin
up
to
the
mess
men
and
women
gentlemen
mothers
with
children
infants
with
dolls
were
coming
by
every
road
or
pathway
to
see
the
thing
to
be
seen
at
the
bravées
turning
their
backs
upon
peter
port
many
shops
at
peter
port
were
closed
in
the
commercial
arcade
there
was
an
absolute
stagnation
in
buying
and
selling
the
durande
alone
obtained
attention
not
a
single
shopkeeper
had
had
a
handsell
that
morning
except
a
jeweller
who
was
surprised
at
having
sold
a
to
a
sort
of
man
who
appeared
in
a
great
hurry
and
who
asked
for
the
house
of
the
dean
the
shops
which
remained
open
were
centres
of
gossip
where
loiterers
discussed
the
miraculous
salvage
there
was
not
a
at
the
hyvreuse
which
is
known
in
these
days
nobody
knows
why
as
cambridge
park
no
one
was
in
the
high
street
then
called
the
grande
rue
nor
in
smith
street
known
then
only
as
the
rue
des
forges
nobody
in
hauteville
the
esplanade
itself
was
deserted
one
might
have
guessed
it
to
be
sunday
a
visit
from
a
royal
personage
to
review
the
militia
at
the
ancresse
could
not
have
emptied
the
town
more
completely
all
this
hubbub
about
a
nobody
like
gilliatt
caused
a
good
deal
of
shrugging
of
the
shoulders
among
persons
of
grave
and
correct
habits
the
church
of
peter
port
with
its
three
placed
side
by
side
its
transept
and
its
steeple
stands
at
the
water
side
at
the
end
of
the
harbour
and
nearly
on
the
landing
place
itself
where
it
welcomes
those
who
arrive
and
gives
the
departing
god
speed
it
represents
the
capital
letter
at
the
beginning
of
that
long
line
which
forms
the
front
of
the
town
towards
the
sea
it
is
both
the
parish
church
of
peter
port
and
the
chief
place
of
the
deanery
of
the
whole
island
its
officiating
minister
is
the
surrogate
of
the
bishop
a
clergyman
in
full
orders
the
harbour
of
peter
port
a
very
fine
and
large
port
at
the
present
day
was
at
that
epoch
and
even
up
to
ten
years
ago
less
considerable
than
the
harbour
of
sampson
it
was
enclosed
by
two
enormous
thick
walls
beginning
at
the
water
edge
on
both
sides
and
curving
till
they
almost
joined
again
at
the
extremities
where
there
stood
a
little
white
lighthouse
under
this
lighthouse
a
narrow
gullet
bearing
still
the
two
rings
of
the
chain
with
which
it
was
the
custom
to
bar
the
passage
in
ancient
times
formed
the
entrance
for
vessels
the
harbour
of
peter
port
might
be
well
compared
with
the
claws
of
a
huge
lobster
opened
a
little
way
this
kind
of
pincers
took
from
the
ocean
a
portion
of
the
sea
which
it
compelled
to
remain
calm
but
during
the
easterly
winds
the
waves
rolled
heavily
against
the
narrow
entrance
the
port
was
agitated
and
it
was
better
not
to
enter
this
is
what
had
happened
with
the
that
day
which
had
accordingly
anchored
in
the
roads
the
vessels
during
the
easterly
winds
preferred
this
course
which
besides
saved
them
the
port
dues
on
these
occasions
the
boatmen
of
the
town
a
hardy
race
of
mariners
whom
the
new
port
has
thrown
out
of
employment
came
in
their
boats
to
fetch
passengers
at
the
or
at
stations
on
the
shore
and
carried
them
with
their
luggage
often
in
heavy
seas
but
always
without
accident
to
the
vessels
about
to
sail
the
east
wind
blows
off
the
shore
and
is
very
favourable
for
the
passage
to
england
the
vessel
at
such
times
rolls
but
does
not
pitch
when
a
vessel
happened
to
be
in
the
port
everybody
embarked
from
the
quay
when
it
was
in
the
roads
they
took
their
choice
and
embarked
from
any
point
of
the
coast
near
the
moorings
the
havelet
was
one
of
these
creeks
this
little
harbour
which
is
the
signification
of
the
word
was
near
the
town
but
was
so
solitary
that
it
seemed
far
off
this
solitude
was
owing
to
the
shelter
of
the
high
cliffs
of
fort
george
which
overlooked
this
retired
inlet
the
havelet
was
accessible
by
several
paths
the
most
direct
was
along
the
water
side
it
had
the
advantage
of
leading
to
the
town
and
to
the
church
in
five
walk
and
the
disadvantage
of
being
covered
by
the
sea
twice
a
day
the
other
paths
were
more
or
less
abrupt
and
led
down
to
the
creek
through
gaps
in
the
steep
rocks
even
in
broad
daylight
it
was
dusk
in
the
havelet
huge
blocks
overhanging
it
on
all
sides
and
thick
bushes
and
brambles
cast
a
sort
of
soft
twilight
upon
the
rocks
and
waves
below
nothing
could
be
more
peaceful
than
this
spot
in
calm
weather
nothing
more
tumultuous
during
heavy
seas
there
were
ends
of
branches
there
which
were
always
wet
with
the
foam
in
the
spring
time
the
place
was
full
of
flowers
of
nests
of
perfumes
of
birds
of
butterflies
and
bees
thanks
to
recent
improvements
this
wild
nook
no
longer
exists
fine
straight
lines
have
taken
the
place
of
these
wild
features
masonry
quays
and
little
gardens
have
made
their
appearance
earthwork
has
been
the
rage
and
taste
has
finally
subdued
the
eccentricities
of
the
cliff
and
the
irregularities
of
the
rocks
below
ii
despair
confronts
despair
it
was
a
little
before
ten
in
the
morning
the
crowd
at
sampson
according
to
all
appearance
was
increasing
the
multitude
feverish
with
curiosity
was
moving
towards
the
north
and
the
havelet
which
is
in
the
south
was
more
deserted
than
ever
notwithstanding
this
there
was
a
boat
there
and
a
boatman
in
the
boat
was
a
travelling
bag
the
boatman
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
one
the
was
visible
at
anchor
in
roads
as
she
did
not
start
till
midday
there
was
as
yet
no
sign
of
moving
aboard
a
who
had
listened
from
one
of
the
up
the
cliffs
overhead
would
have
heard
a
murmur
of
words
in
the
havelet
and
if
he
had
leaned
over
the
overhanging
cliff
might
have
seen
at
some
distance
from
the
boat
in
a
corner
among
the
rocks
and
branches
where
the
eye
of
the
boatman
could
not
reach
them
a
man
and
a
woman
it
was
caudray
and
déruchette
these
obscure
nooks
on
the
seashore
the
chosen
places
of
lady
bathers
are
not
always
so
solitary
as
is
believed
persons
are
sometimes
observed
and
heard
there
those
who
seek
shelter
and
solitude
in
them
may
easily
be
followed
through
the
thick
bushes
and
thanks
to
the
multiplicity
and
entanglement
of
the
paths
the
granite
and
the
shrubs
which
favour
the
stolen
interview
may
also
favour
the
witness
caudray
and
déruchette
stood
face
to
face
looking
into
each
eyes
and
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
déruchette
was
speaking
caudray
was
silent
a
tear
that
had
gathered
upon
his
eyelash
hung
there
and
did
not
fall
grief
and
strong
passion
were
imprinted
in
his
calm
religious
countenance
a
painful
resignation
was
there
too
a
resignation
hostile
to
faith
though
springing
from
it
upon
that
face
simply
devout
until
then
there
was
the
commencement
of
a
fatal
expression
he
who
had
hitherto
meditated
only
on
doctrine
had
begun
to
meditate
on
fate
an
unhealthy
meditation
for
a
priest
faith
dissolves
under
its
action
nothing
disturbs
the
religious
mind
more
than
that
bending
under
the
weight
of
the
unknown
life
seems
a
perpetual
succession
of
events
to
which
man
submits
we
never
know
from
which
direction
the
sudden
blow
will
come
misery
and
happiness
enter
or
make
their
exit
like
unexpected
guests
their
laws
their
orbit
their
principle
of
gravitation
are
beyond
man
grasp
virtue
conducts
not
to
happiness
nor
crime
to
retribution
conscience
has
one
logic
fate
another
and
neither
coincide
nothing
is
foreseen
we
live
confusedly
and
from
hand
to
mouth
conscience
is
the
straight
line
life
is
the
whirlwind
which
creates
above
man
head
either
black
chaos
or
the
blue
sky
fate
does
not
practise
the
art
of
gradations
her
wheel
turns
sometimes
so
fast
that
we
can
scarcely
distinguish
the
interval
between
one
revolution
and
another
or
the
link
between
yesterday
and
caudray
was
a
believer
whose
faith
did
not
exclude
reason
and
whose
priestly
training
did
not
shut
him
out
from
passion
those
religious
systems
which
impose
celibacy
on
the
priesthood
are
not
without
reason
for
it
nothing
really
destroys
the
individuality
of
the
priest
more
than
love
all
sorts
of
clouds
seemed
to
darken
caudray
soul
he
looked
too
long
into
déruchette
eyes
these
two
beings
worshipped
each
other
there
was
in
caudray
eye
the
mute
adoration
of
despair
déruchette
spoke
you
must
not
leave
me
i
shall
not
have
strength
i
thought
i
could
bid
you
farewell
i
can
not
why
did
you
come
yesterday
you
should
not
have
come
if
you
were
going
so
soon
i
never
spoke
to
you
i
loved
you
but
knew
it
not
only
that
day
when
hérode
read
to
us
the
story
of
rebecca
and
when
your
eyes
met
mine
my
cheeks
were
like
fire
and
i
thought
only
of
how
rebecca
face
must
have
burnt
like
mine
and
yet
if
any
one
had
told
me
yesterday
that
i
loved
you
i
might
have
laughed
at
it
this
is
what
is
so
terrible
it
has
been
like
a
treason
i
did
not
take
heed
i
went
to
the
church
i
saw
you
i
thought
everybody
there
was
like
myself
i
do
not
reproach
you
you
did
nothing
to
make
me
love
you
you
did
nothing
but
look
at
me
it
is
not
your
fault
if
you
look
at
people
and
yet
that
made
me
love
you
so
much
i
did
not
even
suspect
it
when
you
took
up
the
book
it
was
a
flood
of
light
when
others
took
it
it
was
but
a
book
you
raised
your
eyes
sometimes
you
spoke
of
archangels
oh
you
were
my
archangel
what
you
said
penetrated
my
thoughts
at
once
before
then
i
know
not
even
whether
i
believed
in
god
since
i
have
known
you
i
have
learnt
to
pray
i
used
to
say
to
douce
dress
me
quickly
lest
i
should
be
late
at
the
service
and
i
hastened
to
the
church
such
it
was
with
me
to
love
some
one
i
did
not
know
the
cause
i
said
to
myself
how
devout
i
am
becoming
it
is
from
you
that
i
have
learnt
that
i
do
not
go
to
church
for
god
service
it
is
true
i
went
for
your
sake
you
spoke
so
well
and
when
you
raised
your
arms
to
heaven
you
seemed
to
hold
my
heart
within
your
two
white
hands
i
was
foolish
but
i
did
not
know
it
shall
i
tell
you
your
fault
it
was
your
coming
to
me
in
the
garden
it
was
your
speaking
to
me
if
you
had
said
nothing
i
should
have
known
nothing
if
you
had
gone
i
should
perhaps
have
been
sad
but
now
i
should
die
since
i
know
that
i
love
you
you
can
not
leave
me
of
what
are
you
thinking
you
do
not
seem
to
listen
to
me
caudray
replied
you
heard
what
was
said
last
night
ah
me
what
can
i
do
against
that
they
were
silent
for
a
moment
caudray
continued
there
is
but
one
duty
left
to
me
it
is
to
depart
and
mine
to
die
oh
how
i
wish
there
was
no
sea
but
only
sky
it
seems
to
me
as
if
that
would
settle
all
and
that
our
departure
would
be
the
same
it
was
wrong
to
speak
to
me
why
did
you
speak
to
me
do
not
go
what
will
become
of
me
i
tell
you
i
shall
die
you
will
be
far
off
when
i
shall
be
in
my
grave
oh
my
heart
will
break
i
am
very
wretched
yet
my
uncle
is
not
unkind
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
déruchette
had
ever
said
my
uncle
until
then
she
had
always
said
my
father
caudray
stepped
back
and
made
a
sign
to
the
boatman
déruchette
heard
the
sound
of
the
among
the
shingle
and
the
step
of
the
man
on
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
no
no
cried
déruchette
it
must
be
déruchette
replied
caudray
no
never
for
the
sake
of
an
engine
impossible
did
you
see
that
horrible
man
last
night
you
can
not
abandon
me
thus
you
are
wise
you
can
find
a
means
it
is
impossible
that
you
bade
me
come
here
this
morning
with
the
idea
of
leaving
me
i
have
never
done
anything
to
deserve
this
you
can
have
no
reproach
to
make
me
is
it
by
that
vessel
that
you
intended
to
sail
i
will
not
let
you
go
you
shall
not
leave
me
heaven
does
not
open
thus
to
close
so
soon
i
know
you
will
remain
besides
it
is
not
yet
time
oh
how
i
love
you
and
pressing
closely
to
him
she
interlaced
the
fingers
of
each
hand
behind
his
neck
as
if
partly
to
make
a
bond
of
her
two
arms
for
detaining
him
and
partly
with
her
joined
hands
to
pray
he
moved
away
this
gentle
restraint
while
déruchette
resisted
as
long
as
she
could
déruchette
sank
upon
a
projection
of
the
rock
covered
with
ivy
lifting
by
an
unconscious
movement
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
up
to
the
elbow
and
exhibiting
her
graceful
arm
a
pale
suffused
light
was
in
her
eyes
the
boat
was
approaching
caudray
held
her
head
between
his
hands
he
touched
her
hair
with
a
sort
of
religious
care
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
for
some
moments
then
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
fervently
and
in
an
accent
trembling
with
anguish
and
in
which
might
have
been
traced
the
uprooting
of
his
soul
he
uttered
the
word
which
has
so
often
resounded
in
the
depths
of
the
human
heart
farewell
déruchette
burst
into
loud
sobs
at
this
moment
they
heard
a
voice
near
them
which
said
solemnly
and
deliberately
why
should
you
not
be
man
and
wife
caudray
raised
his
head
déruchette
looked
up
gilliatt
stood
before
them
he
had
approached
by
a
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
that
he
had
appeared
on
the
previous
night
he
had
arranged
his
hair
shaved
his
beard
put
on
shoes
and
a
white
shirt
with
a
large
collar
turned
over
sailor
fashion
he
wore
a
sailor
costume
but
all
was
new
a
gold
ring
was
on
his
little
finger
he
seemed
profoundly
calm
his
sunburnt
skin
had
become
pale
a
hue
of
sickly
bronze
overspread
it
they
looked
at
him
astonished
though
so
changed
déruchette
recognised
him
but
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
were
so
far
from
what
was
passing
in
their
minds
at
that
moment
that
they
had
left
no
distinct
impression
gilliatt
spoke
again
why
should
you
say
farewell
be
man
and
wife
and
go
together
déruchette
started
a
trembling
seized
her
from
head
to
foot
gilliatt
continued
miss
lethierry
is
a
woman
she
is
of
age
it
depends
only
on
herself
her
uncle
is
but
her
uncle
you
love
each
other
déruchette
interrupted
in
a
gentle
voice
and
asked
how
came
you
here
make
yourselves
one
repeated
gilliatt
déruchette
began
to
have
a
sense
of
the
meaning
of
his
words
she
stammered
out
my
poor
uncle
if
the
marriage
was
yet
to
be
said
gilliatt
he
would
refuse
when
it
is
over
he
will
consent
besides
you
are
going
to
leave
here
when
you
return
he
will
forgive
gilliatt
added
with
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
and
then
he
is
thinking
of
nothing
just
now
but
the
rebuilding
of
his
boat
this
will
occupy
his
mind
during
your
absence
the
durande
will
console
him
i
can
not
said
déruchette
in
a
state
of
stupor
which
was
not
without
its
gleam
of
joy
i
must
not
leave
him
unhappy
it
will
be
but
for
a
short
time
answered
gilliatt
caudray
and
déruchette
had
been
as
it
were
bewildered
they
recovered
themselves
now
the
meaning
of
gilliatt
words
became
plainer
as
their
surprise
diminished
there
was
a
slight
cloud
still
before
them
but
their
part
was
not
to
resist
we
yield
easily
to
those
who
come
to
save
objections
to
a
return
into
paradise
are
weak
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
of
déruchette
as
she
leaned
imperceptibly
upon
her
lover
which
seemed
to
make
common
cause
with
gilliatt
words
the
enigma
of
the
presence
of
this
man
and
of
his
utterances
which
in
the
mind
of
déruchette
in
particular
produced
various
kinds
of
astonishment
was
a
thing
apart
he
said
to
them
be
man
and
wife
this
was
clear
if
there
was
responsibility
it
was
his
déruchette
had
a
confused
feeling
that
for
many
reasons
he
had
the
right
to
decide
upon
her
fate
caudray
murmured
as
if
plunged
in
thought
an
uncle
is
not
a
father
his
resolution
was
corrupted
by
the
sudden
and
happy
turn
in
his
ideas
the
probable
scruples
of
the
clergyman
melted
and
dissolved
in
his
heart
love
for
déruchette
gilliatt
tone
became
abrupt
and
harsh
and
like
the
pulsations
of
fever
there
must
be
no
delay
he
said
you
have
time
but
that
is
all
come
caudray
observed
him
attentively
and
suddenly
exclaimed
i
recognise
you
it
was
you
who
saved
my
life
gilliatt
replied
i
think
not
yonder
said
caudray
at
the
extremity
of
the
banques
i
do
not
know
the
place
said
gilliatt
it
was
on
the
very
day
that
i
arrived
here
let
us
lose
no
time
interrupted
gilliatt
and
if
i
am
not
deceived
you
are
the
man
whom
we
met
last
night
perhaps
what
is
your
name
gilliatt
raised
his
voice
boatman
wait
there
for
us
we
shall
return
soon
you
asked
me
miss
lethierry
how
i
came
to
be
here
the
answer
is
very
simple
i
walked
behind
you
you
are
in
this
country
when
persons
are
of
age
and
depend
only
on
themselves
they
may
be
married
immediately
let
us
take
the
path
along
the
it
is
passable
the
tide
will
not
rise
here
till
noon
but
lose
no
time
come
with
me
déruchette
and
caudray
seemed
to
consult
each
other
by
a
glance
they
were
standing
close
together
motionless
they
were
intoxicated
with
joy
there
are
strange
hesitations
sometimes
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
of
happiness
they
understood
as
it
were
without
understanding
his
name
is
gilliatt
whispered
déruchette
gilliatt
interrupted
them
with
a
sort
of
tone
of
authority
what
do
you
linger
for
he
asked
i
tell
you
to
follow
me
whither
asked
caudray
there
and
gilliatt
pointed
with
his
finger
towards
the
spire
of
the
church
gilliatt
walked
on
before
and
they
followed
him
his
step
was
firm
but
they
walked
unsteadily
as
they
approached
the
church
an
expression
dawned
upon
those
two
pure
and
beautiful
countenances
which
was
soon
to
become
a
smile
the
approach
to
the
church
lighted
them
up
in
the
hollow
eyes
of
gilliatt
there
was
the
darkness
of
night
the
beholder
might
have
imagined
that
he
saw
a
spectre
leading
two
souls
to
paradise
caudray
and
déruchette
scarcely
took
count
of
what
had
happened
the
interposition
of
this
man
was
like
the
branch
clutched
at
by
the
drowning
they
followed
their
guide
with
the
docility
of
despair
leaning
on
the
first
comer
those
who
feel
themselves
near
death
easily
accept
the
accident
which
seems
to
save
déruchette
more
ignorant
of
life
was
more
confident
caudray
was
thoughtful
déruchette
was
of
age
it
was
true
the
english
formalities
of
marriage
are
simple
especially
in
primitive
parts
where
the
clergyman
has
almost
a
discretionary
power
but
would
the
dean
consent
to
celebrate
the
marriage
without
even
inquiring
whether
the
uncle
consented
this
was
the
question
nevertheless
they
could
learn
in
any
case
there
would
be
but
a
delay
but
what
was
this
man
and
if
it
was
really
he
whom
lethierry
the
night
before
had
declared
should
be
his
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
his
actions
the
very
obstacle
itself
had
become
a
providence
caudray
yielded
but
his
yielding
was
only
the
rapid
and
tacit
assent
of
a
man
who
feels
himself
saved
from
despair
the
pathway
was
uneven
and
sometimes
wet
and
difficult
to
pass
caudray
absorbed
in
thought
did
not
observe
the
occasional
pools
of
water
or
the
heaps
of
shingle
but
from
time
to
time
gilliatt
turned
and
said
to
him
take
heed
of
those
stones
give
her
your
hand
iii
the
forethought
of
it
struck
ten
as
they
entered
the
church
by
reason
of
the
early
hour
and
also
on
account
of
the
desertion
of
the
town
that
day
the
church
was
empty
at
the
farther
end
however
near
the
table
which
in
the
reformed
church
fulfils
the
place
of
the
altar
there
were
three
persons
they
were
the
dean
his
evangelist
and
the
registrar
the
dean
who
was
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
was
seated
the
evangelist
and
the
registrar
stood
beside
him
a
book
was
open
upon
the
table
beside
him
upon
a
was
another
book
it
was
the
parish
register
and
also
open
and
an
attentive
eye
might
have
remarked
a
page
on
which
was
some
writing
of
which
the
ink
was
not
yet
dry
by
the
side
of
the
register
were
a
pen
and
a
the
reverend
jaquemin
hérode
rose
on
perceiving
caudray
i
have
been
expecting
you
he
said
all
is
ready
the
dean
in
fact
wore
his
officiating
robes
caudray
looked
towards
gilliatt
the
reverend
doctor
added
i
am
at
your
service
brother
and
he
bowed
it
was
a
bow
which
neither
turned
to
right
or
left
it
was
evident
from
the
direction
of
the
dean
gaze
that
he
did
not
recognise
the
existence
of
any
one
but
caudray
for
caudray
was
a
clergyman
and
a
gentleman
neither
déruchette
who
stood
aside
nor
gilliatt
who
was
in
the
rear
were
included
in
the
salutation
his
look
was
a
sort
of
parenthesis
in
which
none
but
caudray
were
admitted
the
observance
of
these
little
niceties
constitutes
an
important
feature
in
the
maintenance
of
order
and
the
preservation
of
society
the
dean
continued
with
a
graceful
and
dignified
urbanity
i
congratulate
you
my
colleague
from
a
double
point
of
view
you
have
lost
your
uncle
and
are
about
to
take
a
wife
you
are
blessed
with
riches
on
the
one
hand
and
happiness
on
the
other
moreover
thanks
to
the
boat
which
they
are
about
to
rebuild
mess
lethierry
will
also
be
rich
which
is
as
it
should
be
miss
lethierry
was
born
in
this
parish
i
have
verified
the
date
of
her
birth
in
the
register
she
is
of
age
and
at
her
own
disposal
her
uncle
too
who
is
her
only
relative
consents
you
are
anxious
to
be
united
immediately
on
account
of
your
approaching
departure
this
i
can
understand
but
this
being
the
marriage
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
i
should
have
been
gratified
to
have
seen
it
associated
with
a
little
more
solemnity
i
will
consult
your
wishes
by
not
detaining
you
longer
than
necessary
the
essentials
will
be
soon
complied
with
the
form
is
already
drawn
up
in
the
register
and
it
requires
only
the
names
to
be
filled
in
by
the
terms
of
the
law
and
custom
the
marriage
may
be
celebrated
immediately
after
the
inscription
the
declaration
necessary
for
the
licence
has
been
duly
made
i
take
upon
myself
a
slight
irregularity
for
the
application
for
the
licence
ought
to
have
been
registered
seven
days
in
advance
but
i
yield
to
necessity
and
the
urgency
of
your
departure
be
it
so
then
i
will
proceed
with
the
ceremony
my
evangelist
will
be
the
witness
for
the
bridegroom
as
regards
the
witness
for
the
bride
the
dean
turned
towards
gilliatt
gilliatt
made
a
movement
of
his
head
that
is
sufficient
said
the
dean
caudray
remained
motionless
déruchette
was
happy
but
no
less
powerless
to
move
nevertheless
continued
the
dean
there
is
still
an
obstacle
déruchette
started
the
dean
continued
the
representative
here
present
of
mess
lethierry
applied
for
the
licence
for
you
and
has
signed
the
declaration
on
the
register
and
with
the
thumb
of
his
left
hand
the
dean
pointed
to
gilliatt
which
prevented
the
necessity
of
his
remembering
his
name
the
messenger
from
mess
lethierry
he
added
has
informed
me
this
morning
that
being
too
much
occupied
to
come
in
person
mess
lethierry
desired
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
immediately
this
desire
expressed
verbally
is
not
sufficient
in
consequence
of
having
to
grant
the
licence
and
of
the
irregularity
which
i
take
upon
myself
i
can
not
proceed
so
rapidly
without
informing
myself
from
mess
lethierry
personally
unless
some
one
can
produce
his
signature
whatever
might
be
my
desire
to
serve
you
i
can
not
be
satisfied
with
a
mere
message
i
must
have
some
written
document
that
need
not
delay
us
said
gilliatt
and
he
presented
a
paper
to
the
dean
the
dean
took
it
perused
it
by
a
glance
seemed
to
pass
over
some
lines
as
unimportant
and
read
aloud
go
to
the
dean
for
the
licence
i
wish
the
marriage
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
immediately
would
be
better
he
placed
the
paper
on
the
table
and
proceeded
it
is
signed
lethierry
it
would
have
been
more
respectful
to
have
addressed
himself
to
me
but
since
i
am
called
on
to
serve
a
colleague
i
ask
no
more
caudray
glanced
again
at
gilliatt
there
are
moments
when
mind
and
mind
comprehend
each
other
caudray
felt
that
there
was
some
deception
he
had
not
the
strength
of
purpose
perhaps
he
had
not
the
idea
of
revealing
it
whether
in
obedience
to
a
latent
heroism
of
which
he
had
begun
to
obtain
a
glimpse
or
whether
from
a
deadening
of
the
conscience
arising
from
the
suddenness
of
the
happiness
placed
within
his
reach
he
uttered
no
word
the
dean
took
the
pen
and
aided
by
the
clerk
filled
up
the
spaces
in
the
page
of
the
register
then
he
rose
and
by
a
gesture
invited
caudray
and
déruchette
to
approach
the
table
the
ceremony
commenced
it
was
a
strange
moment
caudray
and
déruchette
stood
beside
each
other
before
the
minister
he
who
has
ever
dreamed
of
a
marriage
in
which
he
himself
was
chief
actor
may
conceive
something
of
the
feeling
which
they
experienced
gilliatt
stood
at
a
little
distance
in
the
shadow
of
the
pillars
déruchette
on
rising
in
the
morning
desperate
thinking
only
of
death
and
its
associations
had
dressed
herself
in
white
her
attire
which
had
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
mourning
was
suited
to
her
nuptials
a
white
dress
is
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
bride
a
ray
of
happiness
was
visible
upon
her
face
never
had
she
appeared
more
beautiful
her
features
were
remarkable
for
prettiness
rather
than
what
is
called
beauty
their
fault
if
fault
it
be
lay
in
a
certain
excess
of
grace
déruchette
in
repose
that
is
neither
disturbed
by
passion
or
grief
was
graceful
above
all
the
ideal
virgin
is
the
transfiguration
of
a
face
like
this
déruchette
touched
by
her
sorrow
and
her
love
seemed
to
have
caught
that
higher
and
more
holy
expression
it
was
the
difference
between
the
field
daisy
and
the
lily
the
tears
had
scarcely
dried
upon
her
cheeks
one
perhaps
still
lingered
in
the
midst
of
her
smiles
traces
of
tears
indistinctly
visible
form
a
pleasing
but
sombre
accompaniment
of
joy
the
dean
standing
near
the
table
placed
his
finger
upon
the
open
book
and
asked
in
a
distinct
voice
whether
they
knew
of
any
impediment
to
their
union
there
was
no
reply
amen
said
the
dean
caudray
and
déruchette
advanced
a
step
or
two
towards
the
table
joseph
ebenezer
caudray
wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
be
thy
wedded
wife
caudray
replied
i
will
the
dean
continued
durande
déruchette
lethierry
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
be
thy
wedded
husband
déruchette
in
an
agony
of
soul
springing
from
her
excess
of
happiness
murmured
rather
than
uttered
i
will
then
followed
the
beautiful
form
of
the
anglican
marriage
service
the
dean
looked
around
and
in
the
twilight
of
the
church
uttered
the
solemn
words
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
gilliatt
answered
i
do
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
caudray
and
déruchette
felt
a
vague
sense
of
oppression
in
spite
of
their
joy
the
dean
placed
déruchette
right
hand
in
caudray
and
caudray
repeated
after
him
i
take
thee
durande
déruchette
to
be
my
wedded
wife
for
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
love
and
to
cherish
till
death
do
us
part
and
thereto
i
plight
thee
my
troth
the
dean
then
placed
caudray
right
hand
in
that
of
déruchette
and
déruchette
said
after
him
i
take
thee
to
be
my
wedded
husband
for
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
in
sickness
or
in
health
to
love
and
to
cherish
till
death
do
us
part
and
thereto
i
plight
thee
my
troth
the
dean
asked
where
is
the
ring
the
question
took
them
by
surprise
caudray
had
no
ring
but
gilliatt
took
off
the
gold
ring
which
he
wore
upon
his
little
finger
it
was
probably
the
which
had
been
sold
that
morning
by
the
jeweller
in
the
commercial
arcade
the
dean
placed
the
ring
upon
the
book
then
handed
it
to
caudray
who
took
déruchette
little
trembling
left
hand
passed
the
ring
over
her
fourth
finger
and
said
with
this
ring
i
thee
wed
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
continued
the
dean
amen
said
his
evangelist
then
the
dean
said
let
us
pray
caudray
and
déruchette
turned
towards
the
table
and
knelt
down
gilliatt
standing
by
inclined
his
head
so
they
knelt
before
god
while
he
seemed
to
bend
under
the
burden
of
his
fate
iv
for
your
wife
when
you
marry
as
they
left
the
church
they
could
see
the
making
preparations
for
her
departure
you
are
in
time
said
gilliatt
they
chose
again
the
path
leading
to
the
havelet
caudray
and
déruchette
went
before
gilliatt
this
time
walking
behind
them
they
were
two
somnambulists
their
bewilderment
had
not
passed
away
but
only
changed
in
form
they
took
no
heed
of
whither
they
were
going
or
of
what
they
did
they
hurried
on
mechanically
scarcely
remembering
the
existence
of
anything
feeling
that
they
were
united
for
ever
but
scarcely
able
to
connect
two
ideas
in
their
minds
in
ecstasy
like
theirs
it
is
as
impossible
to
think
as
it
is
to
swim
in
a
torrent
in
the
midst
of
their
trouble
and
darkness
they
had
been
plunged
in
a
whirlpool
of
delight
they
bore
a
paradise
within
themselves
they
did
not
speak
but
conversed
with
each
other
by
the
mysterious
sympathy
of
their
souls
déruchette
pressed
caudray
arm
to
her
side
the
footsteps
of
gilliatt
behind
them
reminded
them
now
and
then
that
he
was
there
they
were
deeply
moved
but
could
find
no
words
the
excess
of
emotion
results
in
stupor
theirs
was
delightful
but
overwhelming
they
were
man
and
wife
every
other
idea
was
postponed
to
that
what
gilliatt
had
done
was
well
that
was
all
that
they
could
grasp
they
experienced
towards
their
guide
a
deep
but
vague
gratitude
in
their
hearts
déruchette
felt
that
there
was
some
mystery
to
be
explained
but
not
now
meanwhile
they
accepted
their
unexpected
happiness
they
felt
themselves
controlled
by
the
abruptness
and
decision
of
this
man
who
conferred
on
them
so
much
happiness
with
a
kind
of
authority
to
question
him
to
talk
with
him
seemed
impossible
too
many
impressions
rushed
into
their
minds
at
once
for
that
their
absorption
was
pardonable
events
succeed
each
other
sometimes
with
the
rapidity
of
hailstones
their
effect
is
overpowering
they
deaden
the
senses
falling
upon
existences
habitually
calm
they
render
incidents
rapidly
unintelligible
even
to
those
whom
they
chiefly
concern
we
become
scarcely
conscious
of
our
own
adventures
we
are
overwhelmed
without
guessing
the
cause
or
crowned
with
happiness
without
comprehending
it
for
some
hours
déruchette
had
been
subjected
to
every
kind
of
emotion
at
first
surprise
and
delight
at
meeting
caudray
in
the
garden
then
horror
at
the
monster
whom
her
uncle
had
presented
as
her
husband
then
her
anguish
when
the
angel
of
her
dreams
spread
his
wings
and
seemed
about
to
depart
and
now
her
joy
a
joy
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
founded
on
an
inexplicable
enigma
the
monster
of
last
night
himself
restoring
her
lover
marriage
arising
out
of
her
torture
this
gilliatt
the
evil
destiny
of
last
night
become
her
saviour
she
could
explain
nothing
to
her
own
mind
it
was
evident
that
all
the
morning
gilliatt
had
had
no
other
occupation
than
that
of
preparing
the
way
for
their
marriage
he
had
done
all
he
had
answered
for
mess
lethierry
seen
the
dean
obtained
the
licence
signed
the
necessary
declaration
and
thus
the
marriage
had
been
rendered
possible
but
déruchette
understood
it
not
if
she
had
she
could
not
have
comprehended
the
reasons
they
did
nothing
but
close
their
eyes
to
the
world
and
grateful
in
their
hearts
yield
themselves
up
to
the
guidance
of
this
good
demon
there
was
no
time
for
explanations
and
expressions
of
gratitude
seemed
too
insignificant
they
were
silent
in
their
trance
of
love
the
little
power
of
thought
which
they
retained
was
scarcely
more
than
sufficient
to
guide
them
on
their
way
to
enable
them
to
distinguish
the
sea
from
the
land
and
the
from
every
other
vessel
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
the
little
creek
caudray
entered
the
boat
first
at
the
moment
when
déruchette
was
about
to
follow
she
felt
her
sleeve
held
gently
it
was
gilliatt
who
had
placed
his
finger
upon
a
fold
of
her
dress
madam
he
said
you
are
going
on
a
journey
unexpectedly
it
has
struck
me
that
you
would
have
need
of
dresses
and
clothes
you
will
find
a
trunk
aboard
the
containing
a
lady
clothing
it
came
to
me
from
my
mother
it
was
intended
for
my
wife
if
i
should
marry
permit
me
to
ask
your
acceptance
of
it
déruchette
partially
aroused
from
her
dream
turned
towards
him
gilliatt
continued
in
a
voice
which
was
scarcely
audible
i
do
not
wish
to
detain
you
madam
but
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
give
you
some
explanation
on
the
day
of
your
misfortune
you
were
sitting
in
the
lower
room
you
uttered
certain
words
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
you
have
forgotten
them
we
are
not
compelled
to
remember
every
word
we
speak
mess
lethierry
was
in
great
sorrow
it
was
certainly
a
noble
vessel
and
one
that
did
good
service
the
misfortune
was
recent
there
was
a
great
commotion
those
are
things
which
one
naturally
forgets
it
was
only
a
vessel
wrecked
among
the
rocks
one
can
not
be
always
thinking
of
an
accident
but
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
was
that
as
it
was
said
that
no
one
would
go
i
went
they
said
it
was
impossible
but
it
was
not
i
thank
you
for
listening
to
me
a
moment
you
can
understand
madam
that
if
i
went
there
it
was
not
with
the
thought
of
displeasing
you
this
is
a
thing
besides
of
old
date
i
know
that
you
are
in
haste
if
there
was
time
if
we
could
talk
about
this
you
might
perhaps
remember
but
this
is
all
useless
now
the
history
of
it
goes
back
to
a
day
when
there
was
snow
upon
the
ground
and
then
on
one
occasion
that
i
passed
you
i
thought
that
you
looked
kindly
on
me
this
is
how
it
was
with
regard
to
last
night
i
had
not
had
time
to
go
to
my
home
i
came
from
my
labour
i
was
all
torn
and
ragged
i
startled
you
and
you
fainted
i
was
to
blame
people
do
not
come
like
that
to
houses
i
ask
your
forgiveness
this
is
nearly
all
i
had
to
say
you
are
about
to
sail
you
will
have
fine
weather
the
wind
is
in
the
east
farewell
you
will
not
blame
me
for
troubling
you
with
these
things
this
is
the
last
minute
i
am
thinking
of
the
trunk
you
spoke
of
replied
déruchette
why
do
you
not
keep
it
for
your
wife
when
you
marry
it
is
most
likely
madam
replied
gilliatt
that
i
shall
never
marry
that
would
be
a
pity
said
déruchette
you
are
so
good
and
déruchette
smiled
gilliatt
returned
her
smile
then
he
assisted
her
to
step
into
the
boat
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
caudray
and
déruchette
were
aboard
the
in
the
roads
v
the
great
tomb
gilliatt
walked
along
the
passed
rapidly
through
port
and
then
turned
towards
sampson
by
the
seashore
in
his
anxiety
to
meet
no
one
whom
he
knew
he
avoided
the
highways
now
filled
with
by
his
great
achievement
for
a
long
time
as
the
reader
knows
he
had
had
a
peculiar
manner
of
traversing
the
country
in
all
parts
without
being
observed
he
knew
the
and
favoured
solitary
and
winding
routes
he
had
the
shy
habits
of
a
wild
beast
who
knows
that
he
is
disliked
and
keeps
at
a
distance
when
quite
a
child
he
had
been
quick
to
feel
how
little
welcome
men
showed
in
their
faces
at
his
approach
and
he
had
gradually
contracted
that
habit
of
being
alone
which
had
since
become
an
instinct
he
passed
through
the
esplanade
then
by
the
salerie
now
and
then
he
turned
and
looked
behind
him
at
the
in
the
roads
which
was
beginning
to
set
her
sails
there
was
little
wind
gilliatt
went
faster
than
the
he
walked
with
downcast
eyes
among
the
lower
rocks
at
the
water
edge
the
tide
was
beginning
to
rise
suddenly
he
stopped
and
turning
his
back
contemplated
for
some
minutes
a
group
of
oaks
beyond
the
rocks
which
concealed
the
road
to
vale
they
were
the
oaks
at
the
spot
called
the
basses
maisons
it
was
there
that
déruchette
once
wrote
with
her
finger
the
name
of
gilliatt
in
the
snow
many
a
day
had
passed
since
that
snow
had
melted
away
then
he
pursued
his
way
the
day
was
beautiful
more
beautiful
than
any
that
had
yet
been
seen
that
year
it
was
one
of
those
spring
days
when
may
suddenly
pours
forth
all
its
beauty
and
when
nature
seems
to
have
no
thought
but
to
rejoice
and
be
happy
amidst
the
many
murmurs
from
forest
and
village
from
the
sea
and
the
air
a
sound
of
cooing
could
be
distinguished
the
first
butterflies
of
the
year
were
resting
on
the
early
roses
everything
in
nature
seemed
new
the
grass
the
mosses
the
leaves
the
perfumes
the
rays
of
light
the
sun
shone
as
if
it
had
never
shone
before
the
pebbles
seemed
bathed
in
coolness
birds
but
lately
fledged
sang
out
their
deep
notes
from
the
trees
or
fluttered
among
the
boughs
in
their
attempts
to
use
their
wings
there
was
a
chattering
all
together
of
goldfinches
pewits
tomtits
woodpeckers
bullfinches
and
thrushes
the
blossoms
of
lilacs
may
lilies
daphnes
and
melilots
mingled
their
various
hues
in
the
thickets
a
beautiful
kind
of
peculiar
to
guernsey
covered
the
pools
with
an
emerald
green
where
the
kingfishers
and
the
which
make
such
graceful
little
nests
came
down
to
bathe
their
wings
through
every
opening
in
the
branches
appeared
the
deep
blue
sky
a
few
lazy
clouds
followed
each
other
in
the
azure
depths
the
ear
seemed
to
catch
the
sound
of
kisses
sent
from
invisible
lips
every
old
wall
had
its
tufts
of
wallflowers
the
and
laburnums
were
in
blossom
their
white
and
yellow
masses
gleamed
through
the
interlacing
boughs
the
spring
showered
all
her
gold
and
silver
on
the
woods
the
new
shoots
and
leaves
were
green
and
fresh
calls
of
welcome
were
in
the
air
the
approaching
summer
opened
her
hospitable
doors
for
birds
coming
from
afar
it
was
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
swallows
the
clusters
of
bordered
the
steep
sides
of
hollow
roads
in
anticipation
of
the
clusters
of
the
hawthorn
the
pretty
and
the
beautiful
reigned
side
by
side
the
magnificent
and
the
graceful
the
great
and
the
little
had
each
their
place
no
note
in
the
great
concert
of
nature
was
lost
green
microscopic
beauties
took
their
place
in
the
vast
universal
plan
in
which
all
seemed
distinguishable
as
in
limpid
water
everywhere
a
divine
fulness
a
mysterious
sense
of
expansion
suggested
the
unseen
effort
of
the
sap
in
movement
guttering
things
glittered
more
than
ever
loving
natures
became
more
tender
there
was
a
hymn
in
the
flowers
and
a
radiance
in
the
sounds
of
the
air
the
harmony
of
nature
burst
forth
on
every
side
all
things
which
felt
the
dawn
of
life
invited
others
to
put
forth
shoots
a
movement
coming
from
below
and
also
from
above
stirred
vaguely
all
hearts
susceptible
to
the
scattered
and
subterranean
influence
of
germination
the
flower
shadowed
forth
the
fruit
young
maidens
dreamed
of
love
it
was
nature
universal
bridal
it
was
fine
bright
and
warm
through
the
hedges
in
the
meadows
children
were
seen
laughing
and
playing
at
their
games
the
filled
the
orchards
with
their
heaps
of
white
and
pink
blossom
in
the
fields
were
primroses
cowslips
milfoil
daffodils
daisies
speedwell
jacinths
and
violets
blue
borage
and
yellow
irises
swarmed
with
those
beautiful
little
pink
stars
which
flower
always
in
groups
and
are
hence
called
companions
creatures
with
golden
scales
glided
between
the
stones
the
flowering
houseleek
covered
the
thatched
roofs
with
purple
patches
women
were
plaiting
hives
in
the
open
air
and
the
bees
were
abroad
mingling
their
humming
with
the
murmurs
from
the
sea
nature
sensitive
to
the
touch
of
spring
exhaled
delight
when
gilliatt
arrived
at
sampson
the
water
had
not
yet
risen
at
the
further
end
of
the
harbour
and
he
was
able
to
cross
it
unperceived
behind
the
hulls
of
vessels
fixed
for
repair
a
number
of
flat
stones
were
placed
there
at
regular
distances
to
make
a
causeway
he
was
not
observed
the
crowd
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
port
near
the
narrow
entrance
by
the
bravées
there
his
name
was
in
every
mouth
they
were
in
fact
speaking
about
him
so
much
that
none
paid
attention
to
him
he
passed
sheltered
in
some
degree
by
the
very
commotion
that
he
had
caused
he
saw
from
afar
the
sloop
in
the
place
where
he
had
moored
it
with
the
funnel
standing
between
its
four
chains
observed
a
movement
of
carpenters
at
their
work
and
confused
outlines
of
figures
passing
to
and
fro
and
he
could
distinguish
the
loud
and
cheery
voice
of
mess
lethierry
giving
orders
he
threaded
the
narrow
alleys
behind
the
bravées
there
was
no
one
there
beside
him
all
curiosity
was
concentrated
on
the
front
of
the
house
he
chose
the
footpath
alongside
the
low
wall
of
the
garden
but
stopped
at
the
angle
where
the
wild
mallow
grew
he
saw
once
more
the
stone
where
he
used
to
pass
his
time
saw
once
more
the
wooden
garden
seat
where
déruchette
was
accustomed
to
sit
and
glanced
again
at
the
pathway
of
the
alley
where
he
had
seen
the
embrace
of
two
shadows
which
had
vanished
he
soon
went
on
his
way
climbed
the
hill
of
vale
castle
descended
again
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
bû
de
la
rue
the
was
a
solitude
his
house
was
in
the
same
state
in
which
he
had
left
it
in
the
morning
after
dressing
himself
to
go
to
peter
port
a
window
was
open
through
which
his
bagpipe
might
have
been
seen
hanging
to
a
nail
upon
the
wall
upon
the
table
was
the
little
bible
given
to
him
in
token
of
gratitude
by
the
stranger
whom
he
now
knew
as
caudray
the
key
was
in
the
door
he
approached
placed
his
hand
upon
it
turned
it
twice
in
the
lock
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
departed
he
walked
not
in
the
direction
of
the
town
but
towards
the
sea
he
traversed
his
garden
diagonally
taking
the
shortest
way
without
regard
to
the
beds
but
taking
care
not
to
tread
upon
the
plants
which
he
placed
there
because
he
had
heard
that
they
were
favourites
with
déruchette
he
crossed
the
parapet
wall
and
let
himself
down
upon
the
rocks
going
straight
on
he
began
to
follow
the
long
ridge
of
rocks
which
connected
the
bû
de
la
rue
with
the
great
natural
obelisk
of
granite
rising
erect
from
the
sea
which
was
known
as
the
beast
horn
this
was
the
place
of
the
seat
he
strode
on
from
block
to
block
like
a
giant
among
mountains
to
make
long
strides
upon
a
row
of
breakers
is
like
walking
upon
the
ridge
of
a
roof
a
fisherwoman
with
who
had
been
walking
among
the
pools
of
at
some
distance
and
had
just
regained
the
shore
called
to
him
take
care
the
tide
is
coming
but
he
held
on
his
way
having
arrived
at
the
great
rock
of
the
point
the
horn
which
rises
like
a
pinnacle
from
the
sea
he
stopped
it
was
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
he
looked
around
out
at
sea
a
few
sailing
boats
at
anchor
were
fishing
now
and
then
rivulets
of
silver
glittered
among
them
in
the
sun
it
was
the
water
running
from
the
nets
the
was
not
yet
off
sampson
she
had
set
her
and
was
between
herm
and
jethou
gilliatt
rounded
the
rock
and
came
under
the
seat
at
the
foot
of
that
kind
of
abrupt
stairs
where
less
than
three
months
before
he
had
assisted
caudray
to
come
down
he
ascended
the
greater
number
of
the
steps
were
already
under
water
two
or
three
only
were
still
dry
by
which
he
climbed
the
steps
led
up
to
the
seat
he
reached
the
niche
contemplated
it
for
a
moment
pressed
his
hand
upon
his
eyes
and
let
it
glide
gently
from
one
eyelid
to
the
other
a
gesture
by
which
he
seemed
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
the
past
then
sat
down
in
the
hollow
with
the
perpendicular
wall
behind
him
and
the
ocean
at
his
feet
the
at
that
moment
was
passing
the
great
round
tower
defended
by
one
sergeant
and
a
cannon
which
marks
the
half
way
in
the
roads
between
herm
and
peter
port
a
few
flowers
stirred
among
the
crevices
in
the
rock
about
head
the
sea
was
blue
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
the
wind
came
from
the
east
there
was
a
little
surf
in
the
direction
of
the
island
of
sark
of
which
only
the
western
side
is
visible
from
guernsey
in
the
distance
appeared
the
coast
of
france
like
a
mist
with
the
long
yellow
strips
of
sand
about
carteret
now
and
then
a
white
butterfly
fluttered
by
the
butterflies
frequently
fly
out
to
sea
the
breeze
was
very
slight
the
blue
expanse
both
above
and
below
was
tranquil
not
a
ripple
agitated
those
species
of
serpents
of
an
azure
more
or
less
dark
which
indicate
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
lines
of
sunken
rocks
the
little
moved
by
the
wind
had
set
her
topsail
and
to
catch
the
breeze
all
her
canvas
was
spread
but
the
wind
being
a
side
one
her
only
compelled
her
to
hug
the
guernsey
coast
more
closely
she
had
passed
the
beacon
of
sampson
and
was
off
the
hill
of
vale
castle
the
moment
was
approaching
when
she
would
double
the
point
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
gilliatt
watched
her
approach
the
air
and
sea
were
still
the
tide
rose
not
by
waves
but
by
an
imperceptible
swell
the
level
of
the
water
crept
upward
without
a
palpitation
the
subdued
murmur
from
the
open
sea
was
soft
as
the
breathing
of
a
child
in
the
direction
of
the
harbour
of
sampson
faint
echoes
could
be
heard
of
carpenters
hammers
the
carpenters
were
probably
the
workmen
constructing
the
tackle
gear
and
apparatus
for
removing
the
engine
from
the
sloop
the
sounds
however
scarcely
reached
gilliatt
by
reason
of
the
mass
of
granite
at
his
back
the
approached
with
the
slowness
of
a
phantom
gilliatt
watched
it
still
suddenly
a
touch
and
a
sensation
of
cold
caused
him
to
look
down
the
sea
had
reached
his
feet
he
lowered
his
eyes
then
raised
them
again
the
was
quite
near
the
rock
in
which
the
rains
had
hollowed
out
the
seat
was
so
completely
vertical
and
there
was
so
much
water
at
its
base
that
in
calm
weather
vessels
were
able
to
pass
without
danger
within
a
few
cables
lengths
the
was
abreast
of
the
rock
it
rose
straight
upwards
as
if
it
had
grown
out
of
the
water
or
like
the
lengthening
out
of
a
shadow
the
rigging
showed
black
against
the
heavens
and
in
the
magnificent
expanse
of
the
sea
the
long
sails
passing
for
a
moment
over
the
sun
became
lighted
up
with
a
singular
glory
and
transparence
the
water
murmured
indistinctly
but
no
other
noise
marked
the
majestic
gliding
of
that
outline
the
deck
was
as
visible
as
if
he
had
stood
upon
it
the
steersman
was
at
the
helm
a
was
climbing
the
shrouds
a
few
passengers
leaning
on
the
bulwarks
were
contemplating
the
beauty
of
the
scene
the
captain
was
smoking
but
nothing
of
all
this
was
seen
by
gilliatt
there
was
a
spot
on
the
deck
on
which
the
broad
sunlight
fell
it
was
on
this
corner
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
this
sunlight
were
déruchette
and
caudray
they
were
sitting
together
side
by
side
like
two
birds
warming
themselves
in
the
noonday
sun
upon
one
of
those
covered
seats
with
a
little
awning
which
provided
for
passengers
and
upon
which
was
the
inscription
when
it
happened
to
be
an
english
vessel
for
ladies
only
déruchette
head
was
leaning
upon
caudray
shoulder
his
arm
was
around
her
waist
they
held
each
hands
with
their
fingers
interwoven
a
celestial
light
was
discernible
in
those
two
faces
formed
by
innocence
their
chaste
embrace
was
expressive
of
their
earthly
union
and
their
purity
of
soul
the
seat
was
a
sort
of
alcove
almost
a
nest
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
glory
round
them
the
tender
aureola
of
love
passing
into
a
cloud
the
silence
was
like
the
calm
of
heaven
caudray
gaze
was
fixed
in
contemplation
déruchette
lips
moved
and
amidst
that
perfect
silence
as
the
wind
carried
the
vessel
near
shore
and
it
glided
within
a
few
fathoms
of
the
seat
gilliatt
heard
the
tender
and
musical
voice
of
déruchette
exclaiming
look
yonder
it
seems
as
if
there
were
a
man
upon
the
rock
the
vessel
passed
leaving
the
promontory
of
the
bû
de
la
rue
behind
the
glided
on
upon
the
waters
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
masts
and
sails
formed
only
a
white
obelisk
gradually
decreasing
against
the
horizon
gilliatt
felt
that
the
water
had
reached
his
knees
he
contemplated
the
vessel
speeding
on
her
way
the
breeze
freshened
out
at
sea
he
could
see
the
run
out
her
lower
and
her
staysails
to
take
advantage
of
the
rising
wind
she
was
already
clear
of
the
waters
of
guernsey
gilliatt
followed
the
vessel
with
his
eyes
the
waves
had
reached
his
waist
the
tide
was
rising
time
was
passing
away
the
seamews
and
cormorants
flew
about
him
restlessly
as
if
anxious
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
it
seemed
as
if
some
of
his
old
companions
of
the
douvres
rocks
flying
there
had
recognised
him
an
hour
had
passed
the
wind
from
the
sea
was
scarcely
felt
in
the
roads
but
the
form
of
the
was
rapidly
growing
less
the
sloop
according
to
all
appearance
was
sailing
fast
it
was
already
nearly
off
the
casquets
there
was
no
foam
around
the
no
wave
beat
against
its
granite
sides
the
water
rose
peacefully
it
was
nearly
level
with
gilliatt
shoulders
another
hour
had
passed
the
was
beyond
the
waters
of
aurigny
the
ortach
rock
concealed
it
for
a
moment
it
passed
behind
it
and
came
forth
again
as
from
an
eclipse
the
sloop
was
veering
to
the
north
upon
the
open
sea
it
was
now
only
a
point
glittering
in
the
sun
the
birds
were
hovering
about
gilliatt
uttering
short
cries
only
his
head
was
now
visible
the
tide
was
nearly
at
the
full
evening
was
approaching
behind
him
in
the
roads
a
few
were
making
for
the
harbour
gilliatt
eyes
continued
fixed
upon
the
vessel
in
the
horizon
their
expression
resembled
nothing
earthly
a
strange
lustre
shone
in
their
calm
and
tragic
depths
there
was
in
them
the
peace
of
vanished
hopes
the
calm
but
sorrowful
acceptance
of
an
end
far
different
from
his
dreams
by
degrees
the
dusk
of
heaven
began
to
darken
in
them
though
gazing
still
upon
the
point
in
space
at
the
same
moment
the
wide
waters
round
the
and
the
vast
gathering
twilight
closed
upon
them
the
now
scarcely
perceptible
had
become
a
mere
spot
in
the
thin
haze
gradually
the
spot
which
was
but
a
shape
grew
paler
then
it
dwindled
and
finally
disappeared
at
the
moment
when
the
vessel
vanished
on
the
line
of
the
horizon
the
head
of
gilliatt
disappeared
nothing
was
visible
now
but
the
sea
