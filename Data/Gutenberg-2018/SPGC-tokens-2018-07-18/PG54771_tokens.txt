an

prince
of
i
criminal
in
disguise
after
no
small
amount
of
deliberation
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
only
fit
and
proper
i
should
set
myself
right
with
the
world
in
the
matter
of
the
now
famous
swindles
for
though
i
have
never
been
openly
accused
of
complicity
in
those
miserable
affairs
yet
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
the
remembrance
that
it
was
i
who
introduced
the
man
who
perpetrated
them
to
london
society
and
that
in
more
than
one
instance
i
acted
innocently
enough
heaven
knows
as
his
ex
in
bringing
about
the
very
results
he
was
so
anxious
to
achieve
i
will
first
allude
in
a
few
words
to
the
year
in
which
the
crimes
took
place
and
then
proceed
to
describe
the
events
that
led
to
my
receiving
the
confession
which
has
so
strangely
and
unexpectedly
come
into
my
hands
whatever
else
may
be
said
on
the
subject
one
thing
at
least
is
certain
it
will
be
many
years
before
london
forgets
that
season
of
festivity
the
joyous
occasion
which
made
half
the
sovereigns
of
europe
our
guests
for
weeks
on
end
kept
foreign
princes
among
us
until
their
faces
became
as
familiar
to
us
as
those
of
our
own
aristocracy
rendered
the
houses
in
our
fashionable
quarters
unobtainable
for
love
or
money
filled
our
hotels
to
repletion
and
produced
daily
pageants
the
like
of
which
few
of
us
have
ever
seen
or
imagined
can
hardly
fail
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
one
of
the
most
notable
in
english
history
small
wonder
therefore
that
the
wealth
then
located
in
our
great
metropolis
should
have
attracted
swindlers
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
that
it
should
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
one
who
has
always
prided
himself
on
steering
clear
of
undesirable
acquaintances
to
introduce
to
his
friends
one
of
the
most
notorious
adventurers
our
capital
has
ever
seen
seems
like
the
irony
of
fate
perhaps
however
if
i
begin
by
showing
how
cleverly
our
meeting
was
contrived
those
who
would
otherwise
feel
inclined
to
censure
me
will
pause
before
passing
judgment
and
will
ask
themselves
whether
they
would
not
have
walked
into
the
snare
as
unsuspectedly
as
i
did
it
was
during
the
last
year
of
my
term
of
office
as
viceroy
and
while
i
was
paying
a
visit
to
the
governor
of
bombay
that
i
decided
upon
making
a
tour
of
the
northern
provinces
beginning
with
peshawur
and
winding
up
with
the
maharajah
of
as
the
latter
potentate
is
so
well
known
i
need
not
describe
him
his
forcible
personality
his
enlightened
rule
and
the
progress
his
state
has
made
within
the
last
ten
years
are
well
known
to
every
student
of
the
history
of
our
magnificent
indian
empire
my
stay
with
him
was
a
pleasant
finish
to
an
otherwise
monotonous
business
for
his
hospitality
has
a
reputation
when
i
arrived
he
placed
his
palace
his
servants
and
his
stables
at
my
disposal
to
use
just
as
i
pleased
my
time
was
practically
my
own
i
could
be
as
solitary
as
a
hermit
if
i
so
desired
on
the
other
hand
i
had
but
to
give
the
order
and
five
hundred
men
would
cater
for
my
amusement
it
seems
therefore
the
more
unfortunate
that
to
this
pleasant
arrangement
i
should
have
to
attribute
the
calamities
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
series
of
stories
to
narrate
on
the
third
morning
of
my
stay
i
woke
early
when
i
had
examined
my
watch
i
discovered
that
it
wanted
an
hour
of
daylight
and
not
feeling
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
again
i
wondered
how
i
should
employ
my
time
until
my
servant
should
bring
me
my
or
early
breakfast
on
proceeding
to
my
window
i
found
a
perfect
morning
the
stars
still
shining
though
in
the
east
they
were
paling
before
the
approach
of
dawn
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
in
a
few
hours
the
earth
which
now
looked
so
cool
and
wholesome
would
be
lying
burnt
up
and
quivering
beneath
the
blazing
indian
sun
i
stood
and
watched
the
picture
presented
to
me
for
some
minutes
until
an
overwhelming
desire
came
over
me
to
order
a
horse
and
go
for
a
long
ride
before
the
sun
should
make
his
appearance
above
the
jungle
trees
the
temptation
was
more
than
i
could
resist
so
i
crossed
the
room
and
opening
the
door
woke
my
servant
who
was
sleeping
in
the
having
bidden
him
find
a
groom
and
have
a
horse
saddled
for
me
without
rousing
the
household
i
returned
and
commenced
my
toilet
then
descending
by
a
private
staircase
to
the
great
courtyard
i
mounted
the
animal
i
found
awaiting
me
there
and
set
off
leaving
the
city
behind
me
i
made
my
way
over
the
new
bridge
with
which
his
highness
has
spanned
the
river
and
crossing
the
plain
headed
towards
the
jungle
that
rises
like
a
green
wall
upon
the
other
side
my
horse
was
a
of
exceptional
excellence
as
every
one
who
knows
the
maharajah
s
stable
will
readily
understand
and
i
was
just
in
the
humor
for
a
ride
but
the
coolness
was
not
destined
to
last
long
for
by
the
time
i
had
left
the
second
village
behind
me
the
stars
had
given
place
to
the
faint
grey
light
of
dawn
a
soft
breeze
stirred
the
palms
and
rustled
the
long
grass
but
its
freshness
was
deceptive
the
sun
would
be
up
almost
before
i
could
look
round
and
then
nothing
could
save
us
from
a
scorching
day
after
i
had
been
riding
for
nearly
an
hour
it
struck
me
that
if
i
wished
to
be
back
in
time
for
breakfast
i
had
better
think
of
returning
at
the
time
i
was
standing
in
the
center
of
a
small
plain
surrounded
by
jungle
behind
me
was
the
path
i
had
followed
to
reach
the
place
in
front
and
to
the
right
and
left
others
leading
whither
i
could
not
tell
having
no
desire
to
return
by
the
road
i
had
come
i
touched
up
my
horse
and
cantered
off
in
an
easterly
direction
feeling
certain
that
even
if
i
had
to
make
a
divergence
i
should
reach
the
city
without
very
much
trouble
by
the
time
i
had
put
three
miles
or
so
behind
me
the
heat
had
become
stifling
the
path
being
completely
shut
in
on
either
side
by
the
densest
jungle
i
have
ever
known
for
all
i
could
see
to
the
contrary
i
might
have
been
a
hundred
miles
from
any
habitation
imagine
my
astonishment
therefore
when
on
turning
a
corner
of
the
track
i
suddenly
left
the
jungle
behind
me
and
found
myself
standing
on
the
top
of
a
stupendous
cliff
looking
down
upon
a
lake
of
blue
water
in
the
center
of
this
lake
was
an
island
and
on
the
island
a
house
at
the
distance
i
was
from
it
the
latter
appeared
to
be
built
of
white
marble
as
indeed
i
afterward
found
to
be
the
case
anything
however
more
lovely
than
the
effect
produced
by
the
blue
water
the
white
building
and
the
hills
upon
the
other
side
can
scarcely
be
imagined
i
stood
and
gazed
at
it
in
delighted
amazement
of
all
the
beautiful
places
i
had
hitherto
seen
in
india
this
i
could
honestly
say
was
entitled
to
rank
first
but
how
it
was
to
benefit
me
in
my
present
situation
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
ten
minutes
later
i
had
discovered
a
guide
and
also
a
path
down
the
cliff
to
the
shore
where
i
was
assured
a
boat
and
a
man
could
be
obtained
to
transport
me
to
the
palace
i
therefore
bade
my
informant
precede
me
and
after
some
minutes
anxious
scrambling
my
horse
and
i
reached
the
water
s
edge
once
there
the
boatman
was
soon
brought
to
light
and
when
i
had
resigned
my
horse
to
the
care
of
my
guide
i
was
rowed
across
to
the
mysterious
residence
in
question
on
reaching
it
we
drew
up
at
some
steps
leading
to
a
broad
stone
esplanade
which
i
could
see
encircled
the
entire
place
out
of
a
grove
of
trees
rose
the
building
itself
a
confused
jumble
of
eastern
architecture
crowned
with
many
towers
with
the
exception
of
the
vegetation
and
the
blue
sky
everything
was
of
a
dazzling
white
against
which
the
dark
green
of
palms
contrasted
with
admirable
effect
springing
from
the
boat
i
made
my
way
up
the
steps
imbued
with
much
the
same
feeling
of
curiosity
as
the
happy
prince
so
familiar
to
us
in
our
nursery
days
must
have
experienced
when
he
found
the
enchanted
castle
in
the
forest
as
i
reached
the
top
to
my
unqualified
astonishment
an
english
appeared
through
a
and
bowed
before
me
breakfast
is
served
he
said
and
my
master
bids
me
say
that
he
waits
to
receive
your
lordship
though
i
thought
he
must
be
making
a
mistake
i
said
nothing
but
followed
him
along
a
terrace
through
a
magnificent
gateway
on
the
top
of
which
a
peacock
was
preening
himself
in
the
sunlight
through
court
after
court
all
built
of
the
same
white
marble
through
a
garden
in
which
a
fountain
was
playing
to
the
rustling
accompaniment
of
pipal
and
pomegranate
leaves
to
finally
enter
the
veranda
of
the
main
building
itself
drawing
aside
the
curtain
which
covered
the
doorway
the
servant
invited
me
to
enter
and
as
i
did
so
announced
his
excellency
the
viceroy
the
change
from
the
vivid
whiteness
of
the
marble
outside
to
the
cool
room
in
which
i
now
found
myself
was
almost
disconcerting
in
its
abruptness
indeed
i
had
scarcely
time
to
recover
my
presence
of
mind
before
i
became
aware
that
my
host
was
standing
before
me
another
surprise
was
in
store
for
me
i
had
expected
to
find
a
native
instead
of
which
he
proved
to
be
an
englishman
i
am
more
indebted
than
i
can
say
to
your
excellency
for
the
honor
of
this
visit
he
began
as
he
extended
his
hand
i
can
only
wish
i
were
better
prepared
for
it
you
must
not
say
that
i
answered
it
is
i
who
should
apologize
i
fear
i
am
an
intruder
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
had
lost
my
way
and
it
is
only
by
chance
that
i
am
here
at
all
i
was
foolish
to
venture
out
without
a
guide
and
have
none
to
blame
for
what
has
occurred
but
myself
in
this
case
i
must
thank
the
fates
for
their
kindness
to
me
returned
my
host
but
don
t
let
me
keep
you
standing
you
must
be
both
tired
and
hungry
after
your
long
ride
and
breakfast
as
you
see
is
upon
the
table
shall
we
show
ourselves
sufficiently
blind
to
the
conventionalities
to
sit
down
to
it
without
further
preliminaries
upon
my
assenting
he
struck
a
small
gong
at
his
side
and
servants
acting
under
the
instructions
of
the
white
man
who
had
conducted
me
to
his
master
s
presence
instantly
appeared
in
answer
to
it
we
took
our
places
at
the
table
and
the
meal
immediately
commenced
while
it
was
in
progress
i
was
permitted
an
excellent
opportunity
of
studying
my
host
who
sat
opposite
me
with
such
light
as
penetrated
the
falling
directly
upon
his
face
i
doubt
however
vividly
as
my
memory
recalls
the
scene
whether
i
can
give
you
an
adequate
description
of
the
man
who
has
since
come
to
be
a
sort
of
nightmare
to
me
in
height
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
five
feet
two
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
would
have
been
evidence
of
considerable
strength
but
for
one
malformation
which
completely
spoilt
his
whole
appearance
the
poor
fellow
suffered
from
curvature
of
the
spine
of
the
worst
sort
and
the
large
hump
between
his
shoulders
produced
a
most
extraordinary
effect
but
it
is
when
i
endeavor
to
describe
his
face
that
i
find
myself
confronted
with
the
most
serious
difficulty
how
to
make
you
realize
it
i
hardly
know
to
begin
with
i
do
not
think
i
should
be
overstepping
the
mark
were
i
to
say
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
countenances
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
its
contour
was
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
bust
of
the
greek
god
hermes
to
whom
all
things
considered
it
is
only
fit
and
proper
he
should
bear
some
resemblance
the
forehead
was
broad
and
surmounted
with
a
wealth
of
dark
hair
in
color
almost
black
his
eyes
were
large
and
dreamy
the
brows
almost
pencilled
in
their
delicacy
the
nose
the
most
prominent
feature
of
his
face
reminded
me
more
of
that
of
the
great
napoleon
than
any
other
i
can
recall
his
mouth
was
small
but
firm
his
ears
as
tiny
as
those
of
an
english
beauty
and
set
in
closer
to
his
head
than
is
usual
with
those
organs
but
it
was
his
chin
that
fascinated
me
most
it
was
plainly
that
of
a
man
accustomed
to
command
that
of
a
man
of
iron
will
whom
no
amount
of
opposition
would
deter
from
his
purpose
his
hands
were
small
and
delicate
and
his
fingers
taper
plainly
those
of
the
artist
either
a
painter
or
a
musician
altogether
he
presented
a
unique
appearance
and
one
that
once
seen
would
not
be
easily
forgotten
during
the
meal
i
congratulated
him
upon
the
possession
of
such
a
beautiful
residence
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
before
unfortunately
he
answered
the
place
does
not
belong
to
me
but
is
the
property
of
our
mutual
host
the
maharajah
his
highness
knowing
that
i
am
a
scholar
and
a
recluse
is
kind
enough
to
permit
me
the
use
of
this
portion
of
the
palace
and
the
value
of
such
a
privilege
i
must
leave
you
to
imagine
you
are
a
student
then
i
said
as
i
began
to
understand
matters
a
little
more
clearly
in
a
perfunctory
sort
of
way
he
replied
that
is
to
say
i
have
acquired
sufficient
knowledge
to
be
aware
of
my
own
ignorance
i
ventured
to
inquire
the
subject
in
which
he
took
most
interest
it
proved
to
be
china
and
the
native
art
of
india
and
on
these
two
topics
we
conversed
for
upwards
of
it
was
evident
that
he
was
a
consummate
master
of
his
subject
this
i
could
the
more
readily
understand
when
our
meal
being
finished
he
led
me
into
an
adjoining
room
in
which
stood
the
cabinets
containing
his
treasures
such
a
collection
i
had
never
seen
before
its
size
and
completeness
amazed
me
but
surely
you
have
not
brought
all
these
specimens
together
yourself
i
asked
in
astonishment
with
a
few
exceptions
he
answered
you
see
it
has
been
the
hobby
of
my
life
and
it
is
to
the
fact
that
i
am
now
engaged
upon
a
book
upon
the
subject
which
i
hope
to
have
published
in
england
next
year
that
you
may
attribute
my
playing
the
hermit
here
you
intend
then
to
visit
england
if
my
book
is
finished
in
time
he
answered
i
shall
be
in
london
at
the
end
of
april
or
the
commencement
of
may
who
would
not
wish
to
be
in
the
chief
city
of
her
majesty
s
dominions
upon
such
a
joyous
and
auspicious
occasion
as
he
said
this
he
took
down
a
small
vase
from
a
shelf
and
as
if
to
change
the
subject
described
its
history
and
its
beauties
to
me
a
stranger
picture
than
he
presented
at
that
moment
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
his
long
fingers
held
his
treasure
as
carefully
as
if
it
were
an
invaluable
jewel
his
eyes
glistened
with
the
fire
of
the
true
collector
who
is
born
but
never
made
and
when
he
came
to
that
part
of
his
narrative
which
described
the
long
hunt
for
and
the
eventual
purchase
of
the
ornament
in
question
his
voice
fairly
shook
with
excitement
i
was
more
interested
than
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
thought
possible
and
it
was
then
that
i
committed
the
most
foolish
action
of
my
life
quite
carried
away
by
his
charm
i
said
i
hope
when
you
come
to
london
you
will
permit
me
to
be
of
any
service
i
can
to
you
i
thank
you
he
answered
gravely
our
lordship
is
very
kind
and
if
the
occasion
arises
as
i
hope
it
will
i
shall
most
certainly
avail
myself
of
your
offer
we
shall
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
i
replied
and
now
if
you
will
not
consider
me
inquisitive
may
i
ask
if
you
live
in
this
great
place
alone
with
the
exception
of
my
servants
i
have
no
companions
really
you
must
surely
find
it
very
lonely
i
do
and
it
is
that
very
solitude
which
endears
it
to
me
when
his
highness
so
kindly
offered
me
the
place
for
a
residence
i
inquired
if
i
should
have
much
company
he
replied
that
i
might
remain
here
twenty
years
and
never
see
a
soul
unless
i
chose
to
do
so
on
hearing
that
i
accepted
his
offer
with
alacrity
then
you
prefer
the
life
of
a
hermit
to
mixing
with
your
i
do
but
next
year
i
shall
put
off
my
monastic
habits
for
a
few
months
and
mix
with
my
as
you
call
them
in
london
you
will
find
hearty
welcome
i
am
sure
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
i
hope
i
shall
but
i
am
forgetting
the
rules
of
hospitality
you
are
a
great
smoker
i
have
heard
let
me
offer
you
a
cigar
as
he
spoke
he
took
a
small
silver
whistle
from
his
pocket
and
blew
a
peculiar
note
upon
it
a
moment
later
the
same
english
servant
who
had
conducted
me
to
his
presence
entered
carrying
a
number
of
cigar
boxes
upon
a
tray
i
chose
one
and
as
i
did
so
glanced
at
the
man
in
outward
appearance
he
was
exactly
what
a
body
servant
should
be
of
medium
height
scrupulously
neat
clean
shaven
and
with
a
face
as
devoid
of
expression
as
a
blank
wall
when
he
had
left
the
room
again
my
host
immediately
turned
to
me
now
he
said
as
you
have
seen
my
collection
will
you
like
to
explore
the
palace
to
this
proposition
i
gladly
assented
and
we
set
off
together
an
hour
later
satiated
with
the
beauty
of
what
i
had
seen
and
feeling
as
if
i
had
known
the
man
beside
me
all
my
life
i
bade
him
upon
the
steps
and
prepared
to
return
to
the
spot
where
my
horse
was
waiting
for
me
one
of
my
servants
will
accompany
you
he
said
and
will
conduct
you
to
the
city
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
you
i
answered
should
i
not
see
you
before
i
hope
you
will
not
forget
your
promise
to
call
upon
me
either
in
calcutta
before
we
leave
or
in
london
next
year
he
smiled
in
a
peculiar
way
you
must
not
think
me
so
blind
to
my
own
interests
as
to
forget
your
kind
offer
he
replied
it
is
just
possible
however
that
i
may
be
in
calcutta
before
you
leave
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
then
i
said
and
having
shaken
him
by
the
hand
stepped
into
the
boat
which
was
waiting
to
convey
me
across
within
an
hour
i
was
back
once
more
to
the
palace
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
maharajah
and
my
staff
to
whom
my
absence
had
been
the
cause
of
considerable
anxiety
it
was
not
until
the
evening
that
i
found
a
convenient
opportunity
and
was
able
to
question
his
highness
about
his
strange
he
quickly
told
me
all
there
was
to
know
about
him
his
name
it
appeared
was
simon
carne
he
was
an
englishman
and
had
been
a
great
traveller
on
a
certain
memorable
occasion
he
had
saved
his
highness
life
at
the
risk
of
his
own
and
ever
since
that
time
a
close
intimacy
had
existed
between
them
for
upwards
of
three
years
the
man
in
question
had
occupied
a
wing
of
the
island
palace
going
away
for
months
at
a
time
presumably
in
search
of
specimens
for
his
collection
and
returning
when
he
became
tired
of
the
world
to
the
best
of
his
highness
belief
he
was
exceedingly
wealthy
but
on
this
subject
little
was
known
such
was
all
i
could
learn
about
the
mysterious
individual
i
had
met
earlier
in
the
day
much
as
i
wanted
to
do
so
i
was
unable
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
palace
on
the
lake
owing
to
pressing
business
i
was
compelled
to
return
to
calcutta
as
quickly
as
possible
for
this
reason
it
was
nearly
eight
months
before
i
saw
or
heard
anything
of
simon
carne
again
when
i
meet
him
we
were
in
the
midst
of
our
preparations
for
returning
to
england
i
had
been
for
a
ride
i
remember
and
was
in
the
act
of
dismounting
from
my
horse
when
an
individual
came
down
the
steps
and
strolled
towards
me
i
recognized
him
instantly
as
the
man
in
whom
i
had
been
so
much
interested
in
he
was
now
dressed
in
fashionable
european
attire
but
there
was
no
mistaking
his
face
i
held
out
my
hand
how
do
you
do
mr
carne
i
cried
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
pray
how
long
have
you
been
in
calcutta
i
arrived
last
night
he
answered
and
leave
morning
for
burma
you
see
i
have
taken
your
excellency
at
your
word
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
i
replied
i
have
the
liveliest
recollection
of
your
kindness
to
me
the
day
that
i
lost
my
way
in
the
jungle
as
you
are
leaving
so
soon
i
fear
we
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
much
of
you
but
possibly
you
can
dine
with
us
this
evening
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
he
answered
simply
watching
me
with
his
wonderful
eyes
which
somehow
always
reminded
me
of
those
of
a
collie
her
ladyship
is
devoted
to
indian
pottery
and
brass
work
i
said
and
she
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
did
not
give
her
an
opportunity
of
consulting
you
upon
her
collection
i
shall
be
very
proud
to
assist
in
any
way
i
can
he
answered
very
well
then
we
shall
meet
at
eight
that
evening
we
had
the
pleasure
of
his
society
at
dinner
and
i
am
prepared
to
state
that
a
more
interesting
guest
has
never
sat
at
a
table
my
wife
and
daughters
fell
under
his
spell
as
quickly
as
i
had
done
indeed
the
former
told
me
afterwards
that
she
considered
him
the
most
uncommon
man
she
had
met
during
her
residence
in
the
east
an
admission
scarcely
complimentary
to
the
numerous
important
members
of
my
council
who
all
prided
themselves
upon
their
originality
when
he
said
we
had
extorted
his
promise
to
call
upon
us
in
london
and
i
gathered
later
that
my
wife
was
prepared
to
make
a
lion
of
him
when
he
should
put
in
an
appearance
how
he
arrive
in
london
during
the
first
week
of
the
following
may
how
it
became
known
that
he
had
taken
porchester
house
which
as
every
one
knows
stands
at
the
corner
of
belverton
street
and
park
lane
for
the
season
at
an
enormous
rental
how
he
furnished
it
superbly
brought
an
army
of
indian
servants
to
wait
upon
him
and
was
prepared
to
astonish
the
town
with
his
entertainments
are
matters
of
history
i
welcomed
him
to
england
and
he
dined
with
us
on
the
night
following
his
arrival
and
thus
it
was
that
we
became
in
a
manner
of
speaking
his
sponsors
in
society
when
one
looks
back
on
that
time
and
remembers
how
vigorously
even
in
the
midst
of
all
that
season
s
gaiety
our
social
world
took
him
up
the
fuss
that
was
made
of
him
the
manner
in
which
his
doings
were
chronicled
by
the
press
it
is
indeed
hard
to
realize
how
egregiously
we
were
all
being
deceived
during
the
months
of
june
and
july
he
was
to
be
met
at
every
house
of
distinction
even
royalty
permitted
itself
to
become
on
friendly
terms
with
him
while
it
was
rumored
that
no
fewer
than
three
of
the
proudest
beauties
in
england
were
prepared
at
any
moment
to
accept
his
offer
of
marriage
to
have
been
a
social
lion
during
such
a
brilliant
season
to
have
been
able
to
afford
one
of
the
most
perfect
residences
in
our
great
city
and
to
have
written
a
book
which
the
foremost
authorities
upon
the
subject
declare
a
masterpiece
are
things
of
which
any
man
might
be
proud
and
yet
this
was
exactly
what
simon
carne
was
and
did
and
now
having
described
his
advent
among
us
i
must
refer
to
the
greatest
excitement
of
all
that
year
unique
as
was
the
occasion
which
prompted
the
gaiety
of
london
constant
as
were
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
illustrious
folk
marvelous
as
were
the
social
functions
and
enormous
the
amount
of
money
expended
it
is
strange
that
the
things
which
attracted
the
most
attention
should
be
neither
royal
social
nor
political
as
may
be
imagined
i
am
referring
to
the
enormous
robberies
and
swindles
which
will
forever
be
associated
with
that
memorable
year
day
after
day
for
weeks
at
a
time
the
press
chronicled
a
series
of
crimes
the
like
of
which
the
oldest
englishman
could
not
remember
it
soon
became
evident
that
they
were
the
work
of
one
person
and
that
that
person
was
a
master
hand
was
as
certain
as
his
success
at
first
the
police
were
positive
that
the
depredations
were
conducted
by
a
foreign
gang
located
somewhere
in
north
london
and
that
they
would
soon
be
able
to
put
their
fingers
on
the
culprits
but
they
were
speedily
undeceived
in
spite
of
their
efforts
the
burglaries
continued
with
painful
regularity
hardly
a
prominent
person
escaped
my
friend
lord
orpington
was
despoiled
of
his
priceless
gold
and
silver
plate
my
cousin
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
lost
her
diamonds
the
earl
of
calingforth
his
vulcanite
and
others
of
my
friends
were
despoiled
of
their
choicest
possessions
how
it
was
that
i
escaped
i
can
understand
now
but
i
must
confess
that
it
passed
my
comprehension
at
the
time
throughout
the
season
simon
carne
and
i
scarcely
spent
a
day
apart
his
society
was
like
chloral
the
more
i
took
of
it
the
more
i
wanted
and
i
am
now
told
that
others
were
affected
in
the
same
way
i
used
to
flatter
myself
that
it
was
to
my
endeavors
he
owed
his
social
success
and
i
can
only
in
justice
say
that
he
tried
to
prove
himself
grateful
i
have
his
portrait
hanging
in
my
library
now
painted
by
a
famous
academician
with
this
inscription
upon
the
lozenge
at
the
base
of
the
frame
my
kind
friend
the
earl
of
amberley
in
remembrance
of
a
happy
and
prosperous
visit
to
london
from
simon
the
portrait
represents
him
standing
before
a
in
a
room
his
extraordinary
face
with
its
dark
penetrating
eyes
is
instinct
with
life
while
his
lips
seem
as
if
opening
to
speak
to
my
thinking
it
would
have
been
a
better
picture
had
he
not
been
standing
in
such
a
way
that
the
light
accentuated
his
deformity
but
it
appears
that
this
was
the
sitter
s
own
desire
thus
confirming
what
on
many
occasions
i
had
felt
compelled
to
believe
namely
that
he
was
for
some
peculiar
reason
proud
of
his
misfortune
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
cowes
week
that
we
parted
company
he
had
been
racing
his
yacht
the
and
as
if
not
satisfied
with
having
won
the
derby
must
needs
appropriate
the
queen
s
cup
it
was
on
the
day
following
that
now
famous
race
that
half
the
leaders
of
london
society
bade
him
farewell
on
the
deck
of
the
steam
yacht
that
was
to
carry
him
back
to
india
a
month
later
and
quite
by
chance
the
dreadful
truth
came
out
then
it
was
discovered
that
the
man
of
whom
we
had
all
been
making
so
much
fuss
the
man
whom
royalty
had
condescended
to
treat
almost
as
a
friend
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
prince
of
swindlers
who
had
been
utilizing
his
splendid
opportunities
to
the
very
best
advantage
every
one
will
remember
the
excitement
which
followed
the
first
disclosure
of
this
dreadful
secret
and
the
others
which
followed
it
as
fresh
discoveries
came
to
light
the
popular
interest
became
more
and
more
intense
while
the
public
s
wonderment
at
the
man
s
almost
superhuman
cleverness
waxed
every
day
greater
than
before
my
position
as
you
may
suppose
was
not
an
enviable
one
i
saw
how
cleverly
i
had
been
duped
and
when
my
friends
who
had
most
of
them
suffered
from
his
talents
congratulated
me
on
my
immunity
i
could
only
console
myself
with
the
reflection
that
i
was
responsible
for
more
than
half
the
acquaintances
the
wretch
had
made
but
deeply
as
i
was
drinking
of
the
cup
of
sorrow
i
had
not
come
to
the
bottom
of
it
yet
one
saturday
evening
the
of
november
if
i
recollect
aright
i
was
sitting
in
my
library
writing
letters
after
dinner
when
i
heard
the
postman
come
round
the
square
and
finally
ascend
the
steps
of
my
house
a
few
moments
later
a
footman
entered
bearing
some
letters
and
a
large
packet
upon
a
salver
having
read
the
former
i
cut
the
string
which
bound
the
parcel
and
opened
it
to
my
surprise
it
contained
a
bundle
of
manuscript
and
a
letter
the
former
i
put
aside
while
i
broke
open
the
envelope
and
extracted
its
contents
to
my
horror
it
was
from
simon
carne
and
ran
as
follows
the
high
my
dear
lord
amberley
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
by
this
time
you
have
become
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
peculiar
services
you
have
rendered
me
i
am
your
debtor
for
as
pleasant
and
at
the
same
time
as
profitable
a
visit
to
london
as
any
man
could
desire
in
order
that
you
may
not
think
me
ungrateful
i
will
ask
you
to
accept
the
accompanying
narrative
of
my
adventures
in
your
great
metropolis
since
i
have
placed
myself
beyond
the
reach
of
capture
i
will
permit
you
to
make
any
use
of
it
you
please
doubtless
you
will
blame
me
but
you
must
at
least
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
in
spite
of
the
splendid
opportunities
you
permitted
me
i
invariably
spared
yourself
and
family
you
will
think
me
mad
thus
to
betray
myself
but
believe
me
i
have
taken
the
greatest
precautions
against
discovery
and
as
i
am
proud
of
my
london
exploits
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
hide
my
light
beneath
a
bushel
with
kind
regards
to
lady
amberley
and
yourself
i
am
yours
very
sincerely
simon
carne
needless
to
say
i
did
not
retire
to
rest
before
i
had
read
the
manuscript
through
from
beginning
to
end
with
the
result
that
the
morning
following
i
communicated
with
the
police
they
were
hopeful
that
they
might
be
able
to
discover
the
place
where
the
packet
had
been
posted
but
after
considerable
search
it
was
found
that
it
had
been
handed
by
a
captain
of
a
yacht
name
unknown
to
the
commander
of
a
homeward
bound
brig
off
finisterre
for
postage
in
plymouth
the
narrative
as
you
will
observe
is
written
in
the
third
person
and
as
far
as
i
can
gather
the
handwriting
is
not
that
of
simon
carne
as
however
the
details
of
each
individual
swindle
coincide
exactly
with
the
facts
as
ascertained
by
the
police
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
their
authenticity
a
year
has
now
elapsed
since
my
receipt
of
the
packet
during
that
time
the
police
of
almost
every
civilized
country
have
been
on
the
alert
to
effect
the
capture
of
my
whilom
friend
but
without
success
whether
his
yacht
sank
and
conveyed
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
or
whether
as
i
suspect
she
only
carried
him
to
a
certain
part
of
the
seas
where
he
changed
into
another
vessel
and
so
eluded
justice
i
can
not
say
even
the
maharajah
of
has
heard
nothing
of
him
since
the
fact
however
remains
i
have
innocently
enough
compounded
a
series
of
felonies
and
as
i
said
at
the
commencement
of
this
preface
the
publication
of
the
narrative
i
have
so
strangely
received
is
intended
to
be
as
far
as
possible
my
excuse
ii
den
of
iniquity
the
night
was
close
and
muggy
such
a
night
indeed
as
only
calcutta
of
all
the
great
cities
of
the
east
can
produce
the
reek
of
the
native
quarter
that
sickly
penetrating
odor
which
once
smelt
is
never
forgotten
filled
the
streets
and
even
invaded
the
sacred
precincts
of
government
house
where
a
man
of
gentlemanly
appearance
but
sadly
deformed
was
engaged
in
bidding
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
s
representative
in
india
an
almost
affectionate
farewell
you
will
not
forget
your
promise
to
acquaint
us
with
your
arrival
in
london
said
his
excellency
as
he
shook
his
guest
by
the
hand
we
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
and
if
we
can
make
your
stay
pleasurable
as
well
as
profitable
to
you
you
may
be
sure
we
shall
endeavor
to
do
so
your
lordship
is
most
hospitable
and
i
think
i
may
safely
promise
that
i
will
avail
myself
of
your
kindness
replied
the
other
in
the
meantime
and
a
pleasant
voyage
to
you
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
passed
the
sentry
and
was
making
his
way
along
the
maidan
to
the
point
where
the
chitpore
road
crosses
it
here
he
stopped
and
appeared
to
deliberate
he
smiled
a
little
sardonically
as
the
recollection
of
the
evening
s
entertainment
crossed
his
mind
and
as
if
he
feared
he
might
forget
something
connected
with
it
when
he
reached
a
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
made
an
entry
in
it
providence
has
really
been
most
kind
he
said
as
he
shut
the
book
with
a
snap
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
and
what
is
more
i
am
prepared
to
be
properly
grateful
it
was
a
good
morning
s
work
for
me
when
his
excellency
decided
to
take
a
ride
through
the
maharajah
s
suburbs
now
i
have
only
to
play
my
cards
carefully
and
success
should
be
assured
he
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
nipped
off
the
end
and
then
lit
it
he
was
still
smiling
when
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
it
is
fortunate
that
her
excellency
is
like
myself
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
indian
art
he
said
it
is
a
trump
card
and
i
shall
play
it
for
all
it
s
worth
when
i
get
to
the
other
side
but
i
have
something
of
more
importance
to
consider
i
have
to
find
the
sinews
of
war
let
us
hope
that
the
luck
which
has
followed
me
hitherto
will
still
hold
good
and
that
liz
will
prove
as
tractable
as
usual
almost
as
he
concluded
his
soliloquy
a
made
its
appearance
and
without
being
hailed
pulled
up
beside
him
it
was
evident
that
their
meeting
was
intentional
for
the
driver
asked
no
question
of
his
fare
who
simply
took
his
seat
laid
himself
back
upon
the
cushions
and
smoked
his
cigar
with
the
air
of
a
man
playing
a
part
in
some
performance
that
had
been
long
arranged
ten
minutes
later
the
coachman
had
turned
out
of
the
chitpore
road
into
a
narrow
from
this
he
broke
off
into
another
and
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
into
still
another
these
offshoots
of
the
main
thoroughfare
were
wrapped
in
inky
darkness
and
in
order
that
there
should
be
as
much
danger
as
possible
they
were
crowded
to
excess
to
those
who
know
calcutta
this
information
will
be
significant
there
are
slums
in
all
the
great
cities
of
the
world
and
every
one
boasts
its
own
peculiar
characteristics
the
ratcliffe
highway
in
london
and
the
streets
that
lead
off
it
can
show
a
fair
assortment
of
vice
the
chinese
quarters
of
new
york
chicago
and
san
francisco
can
more
than
equal
them
little
bourke
street
melbourne
a
portion
of
singapore
and
the
shipping
quarter
of
bombay
have
their
own
individual
qualities
but
surely
for
the
lowest
of
all
the
world
s
low
places
one
must
go
to
calcutta
the
capital
of
our
great
indian
empire
surrounding
the
lai
machua
burra
and
joira
bazaars
are
to
be
found
the
most
infamous
dens
that
mind
of
man
can
conceive
but
that
is
not
all
if
an
exhibition
of
scented
vice
is
required
one
has
only
to
make
one
s
way
into
the
streets
that
lie
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
chitpore
road
to
be
accommodated
reaching
a
certain
corner
the
came
to
a
standstill
and
the
fare
alighted
he
said
something
in
an
undertone
to
the
driver
as
he
paid
him
and
then
stood
upon
the
footway
placidly
smoking
until
the
vehicle
had
disappeared
from
view
when
it
was
no
longer
in
sight
he
looked
up
at
the
houses
towering
above
his
head
in
one
a
marriage
feast
was
being
celebrated
across
the
way
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
in
angry
expostulation
could
be
heard
the
all
of
whom
were
natives
scanned
him
curiously
but
made
no
remark
englishmen
it
is
true
were
seen
in
that
quarter
and
at
that
hour
but
this
one
seemed
of
a
different
class
and
it
is
possible
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
took
him
for
the
most
detested
of
all
englishmen
a
police
officer
for
upwards
of
ten
minutes
he
waited
but
after
that
he
seemed
to
become
impatient
the
person
he
had
expected
to
find
at
the
rendezvous
had
so
far
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
and
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
he
had
better
do
in
the
event
of
his
not
coming
but
badly
as
he
had
started
he
was
not
destined
to
fail
in
his
enterprise
for
just
as
his
patience
was
exhausted
he
saw
hastening
towards
him
a
man
whom
he
recognized
as
the
person
for
whom
he
waited
you
are
late
he
said
in
english
which
he
was
aware
the
other
spoke
fluently
though
he
was
averse
to
owning
it
i
have
been
here
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
was
impossible
that
i
could
get
away
before
the
other
answered
cringingly
but
if
your
excellency
will
be
pleased
to
follow
me
now
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
person
you
seek
without
further
delay
lead
on
said
the
englishman
we
have
wasted
enough
time
already
without
more
ado
the
babu
turned
himself
about
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
he
had
come
never
pausing
save
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
his
companion
was
following
seemingly
countless
were
the
lanes
streets
and
alleys
through
which
they
passed
the
place
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
rabbit
warren
of
small
passages
and
so
dark
that
at
times
it
was
as
much
as
the
englishman
could
do
to
see
his
guide
ahead
of
him
well
acquainted
as
he
was
with
the
quarter
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
himself
master
of
all
its
intricacies
and
as
the
person
whom
he
was
going
to
meet
was
compelled
to
change
her
residence
at
frequent
intervals
he
had
long
given
up
the
idea
of
endeavoring
to
find
her
himself
turning
out
of
a
narrow
lane
which
differed
from
its
fellows
only
in
the
fact
that
it
contained
more
dirt
and
a
greater
number
of
unsavory
odors
they
found
themselves
at
the
top
of
a
short
flights
of
steps
which
in
their
turn
conducted
them
to
a
small
square
round
which
rose
houses
taller
than
any
they
had
yet
discovered
every
window
contained
a
balcony
some
larger
than
others
but
all
in
the
last
stage
of
decay
the
effect
was
peculiar
but
not
so
strange
as
the
quiet
of
the
place
indeed
the
wind
and
the
hum
of
the
city
were
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
now
and
again
figures
issued
from
the
different
doorways
stood
for
a
moment
looking
anxiously
about
them
and
then
disappeared
as
silently
as
they
had
come
all
the
time
not
a
light
was
to
be
seen
nor
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
it
was
a
strange
place
for
a
white
man
to
be
in
and
so
simon
carne
evidently
thought
as
he
obeyed
his
guide
s
invitation
and
entered
the
last
house
on
the
side
whether
the
buildings
had
been
originally
intended
for
residences
or
for
offices
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
they
were
almost
as
old
as
john
company
himself
and
would
not
appear
to
have
been
cleaned
or
repaired
since
they
had
been
first
inhabited
from
the
center
of
the
hall
in
which
he
found
himself
a
massive
staircase
led
to
the
other
floors
and
up
this
carne
marched
behind
his
conductor
on
gaining
the
first
landing
he
paused
while
the
babu
went
forward
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
moment
later
the
shutter
of
a
small
was
pulled
back
and
the
face
of
a
native
woman
looked
out
a
muttered
conversation
ensued
and
after
it
was
finished
the
door
was
opened
and
carne
was
invited
to
enter
this
summons
he
obeyed
with
alacrity
only
to
find
that
once
he
was
inside
the
door
was
immediately
shut
and
barred
behind
him
after
the
darkness
of
the
street
and
the
of
the
stairs
the
dazzling
light
of
the
apartment
in
which
he
now
stood
was
almost
too
much
for
his
eyes
it
was
not
long
however
before
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
look
about
him
the
room
was
a
fine
one
in
shape
almost
square
with
a
large
window
at
the
further
end
covered
with
a
thick
curtain
of
native
cloth
it
was
furnished
with
considerable
taste
in
a
mixture
of
styles
half
european
and
half
native
a
large
lamp
of
worked
brass
burning
some
oil
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
a
quantity
of
tapestry
much
of
it
extremely
rare
covered
the
walls
relieved
here
and
there
with
some
superb
specimens
of
native
weapons
comfortable
divans
were
scattered
about
as
if
inviting
repose
and
as
if
further
to
carry
out
this
idea
beside
one
of
the
lounges
a
marghyle
was
placed
its
tube
curled
up
beside
it
in
a
fashion
somewhat
suggestive
of
a
snake
but
luxurious
as
it
all
was
it
was
evidently
not
quite
what
carne
had
expected
to
find
and
the
change
seemed
to
mystify
as
much
as
it
surprised
him
just
as
he
was
coming
to
a
decision
however
his
ear
caught
the
sound
of
chinking
bracelets
and
next
moment
the
curtain
which
covered
a
doorway
in
the
left
wall
was
drawn
aside
by
a
hand
glistening
with
rings
and
as
tiny
as
that
of
a
little
child
a
second
later
trincomalee
liz
entered
the
room
standing
in
the
doorway
the
heavily
embroidered
curtain
falling
in
thick
folds
behind
her
and
forming
a
most
effective
background
she
made
a
picture
such
as
few
men
could
look
upon
without
a
thrill
of
admiration
at
that
time
she
the
famous
trincomalee
liz
whose
doings
had
made
her
notorious
from
the
saghalian
coast
to
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
was
at
the
prime
of
her
life
and
beauty
a
beauty
such
as
no
man
who
has
ever
seen
it
will
ever
forget
it
was
a
notorious
fact
that
those
tiny
hands
had
ruined
more
men
than
any
other
pairs
in
the
whole
of
india
or
the
east
for
that
matter
not
much
was
known
of
her
history
but
what
had
come
to
light
was
certainly
interesting
as
far
as
could
be
ascertained
she
was
born
in
tonquin
her
father
it
had
been
said
was
a
handsome
but
disreputable
frenchman
who
had
called
himself
a
count
and
over
his
absinthe
was
wont
to
talk
of
his
possessions
in
normandy
her
mother
hailed
from
northern
india
and
she
herself
was
lovelier
than
the
pale
hibiscus
blossom
to
tell
in
what
manner
liz
and
carne
had
become
acquainted
would
be
too
long
a
story
to
be
included
here
but
that
there
was
some
bond
between
the
pair
is
a
fact
that
may
be
stated
without
fear
of
contradiction
on
seeing
her
the
visitor
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
to
meet
her
so
you
have
come
at
last
she
said
holding
out
both
hands
to
him
i
have
been
expecting
you
these
three
weeks
past
remember
you
told
me
you
were
coming
i
was
prevented
said
carne
and
the
business
upon
which
i
desired
to
see
you
was
not
fully
matured
so
there
is
business
then
she
answered
with
a
pretty
petulance
i
thought
as
much
i
might
know
by
this
time
that
you
do
not
come
to
see
me
for
anything
else
but
there
do
not
let
us
talk
in
this
fashion
when
i
have
not
had
you
with
me
for
nearly
a
year
tell
me
of
yourself
and
what
you
have
been
doing
since
last
we
met
as
she
spoke
she
was
occupied
preparing
a
for
him
when
it
was
ready
she
fitted
a
tiny
amber
mouthpiece
to
the
tube
and
presented
it
to
him
with
a
compliment
as
delicate
as
her
own
hands
then
seating
herself
on
a
pile
of
cushions
beside
him
she
bade
him
proceed
with
his
narrative
and
now
she
said
when
he
had
finished
what
is
this
business
that
brings
you
to
me
a
few
moments
elapsed
before
he
began
his
explanation
and
during
that
time
he
studied
her
face
closely
i
have
a
scheme
in
my
head
he
said
laying
the
stick
carefully
upon
the
floor
that
properly
carried
out
should
make
us
both
rich
beyond
telling
but
to
carry
it
out
properly
i
must
have
your
she
laughed
softly
and
nodded
her
head
you
mean
that
you
want
money
she
answered
ah
simon
you
always
want
money
i
want
money
he
replied
without
hesitation
i
want
it
badly
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
and
then
tell
me
if
you
can
give
it
to
me
you
know
what
year
this
is
in
england
she
nodded
her
head
there
were
few
things
with
which
she
had
not
some
sort
of
acquaintance
it
will
be
a
time
of
great
rejoicing
he
continued
half
the
princes
of
the
earth
will
be
assembled
in
london
there
will
be
wealth
untold
there
to
be
had
for
the
mere
gathering
in
and
who
is
so
well
able
to
gather
it
as
i
i
tell
you
liz
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
make
the
journey
and
try
my
luck
and
if
you
will
help
me
with
the
money
you
shall
have
it
back
with
such
jewels
for
interest
as
no
woman
ever
wore
yet
to
begin
with
there
is
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
s
necklace
ah
your
eyes
light
up
you
have
heard
of
it
i
have
she
answered
her
voice
trembling
with
excitement
who
has
not
it
is
the
finest
thing
of
its
kind
in
europe
if
not
in
the
world
he
went
on
slowly
as
if
to
allow
time
for
his
words
to
sink
in
it
consists
of
three
hundred
stones
and
is
worth
apart
from
its
historic
value
at
least
fifty
thousand
pounds
he
saw
her
hands
tighten
on
the
cushions
upon
which
she
sat
fifty
thousand
pounds
that
is
five
lacs
of
rupees
exactly
five
lacs
of
rupees
a
king
s
ransom
he
answered
but
that
is
not
all
there
will
be
twice
as
much
to
be
had
for
the
taking
when
once
i
get
there
find
me
the
money
i
want
and
those
stones
shall
be
your
property
how
much
you
want
the
value
of
the
necklace
he
answered
fifty
thousand
pounds
it
is
a
large
sum
she
said
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
he
smiled
as
if
her
words
were
a
joke
and
should
be
treated
as
such
the
interest
will
be
good
he
answered
but
are
you
certain
of
obtaining
it
she
asked
have
i
ever
failed
yet
he
replied
you
have
done
wonderful
things
certainly
but
this
time
you
are
attempting
so
much
the
greater
the
glory
he
answered
i
have
prepared
my
plans
and
i
shall
not
fail
this
is
going
to
be
the
greatest
undertaking
of
my
life
if
it
comes
off
successfully
i
shall
retire
upon
my
laurels
come
for
the
sake
of
well
you
know
for
the
sake
of
what
will
you
let
me
have
the
money
it
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
done
it
and
on
each
occasion
you
have
not
only
been
repaid
but
well
rewarded
into
the
bargain
when
do
you
want
it
by
it
must
be
paid
in
to
my
account
at
the
bank
before
twelve
o
clock
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
it
i
know
your
respectable
merchant
friends
will
do
it
for
you
if
you
but
hold
up
your
little
finger
if
they
don
t
feel
inclined
then
put
on
the
screw
and
make
them
she
laughed
as
he
paid
this
tribute
to
her
power
a
moment
later
however
she
was
all
gravity
and
the
security
he
leant
towards
her
and
whispered
in
her
ear
it
is
well
she
replied
the
money
shall
be
found
for
you
now
tell
me
your
plans
i
must
know
all
that
you
intend
doing
in
the
first
place
he
answered
drawing
a
little
closer
to
her
and
speaking
in
a
lower
voice
so
that
no
eavesdropper
should
hear
i
shall
take
with
me
abdul
khan
ram
gafur
jowur
singh
and
nur
ali
with
others
of
less
note
as
servants
i
shall
engage
the
best
house
in
london
and
under
the
wing
of
our
gracious
viceroy
who
has
promised
me
the
light
of
his
countenance
will
work
my
way
into
the
highest
society
that
done
i
shall
commence
operations
no
one
shall
ever
suspect
and
when
it
is
finished
and
you
have
accomplished
your
desires
how
will
you
escape
that
i
have
not
yet
arranged
but
of
this
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
run
no
risks
and
afterwards
he
leant
a
little
towards
her
again
and
patted
her
affectionately
upon
the
hand
then
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
he
said
i
don
t
think
you
will
find
me
ungrateful
she
shook
her
pretty
head
it
is
good
talk
she
cried
but
it
means
nothing
you
always
say
the
same
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
will
not
learn
to
love
one
of
the
white
memsahibs
when
you
are
so
much
among
them
because
there
is
but
one
trincomalee
liz
he
answered
and
for
that
reason
you
need
have
no
fear
her
face
expressed
the
doubt
with
which
she
received
this
assertion
as
she
had
said
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
been
cajoled
into
advancing
him
large
sums
with
the
same
assurance
he
knew
this
and
lest
she
should
alter
her
mind
prepared
to
change
the
subject
besides
the
others
i
must
take
hiram
singh
and
wajib
baksh
they
are
in
calcutta
i
am
told
and
i
must
communicate
with
them
before
noon
they
are
the
most
expert
craftsmen
in
india
and
i
shall
have
need
of
them
i
will
have
them
found
and
word
shall
be
sent
to
you
could
i
not
meet
them
here
nay
it
is
impossible
i
shall
not
be
here
myself
i
leave
for
madras
within
six
hours
is
there
then
trouble
toward
she
smiled
and
spread
her
hands
apart
with
a
gesture
that
said
who
knows
he
did
not
question
her
further
but
after
a
little
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
money
rose
to
bid
her
farewell
i
do
not
like
this
idea
she
said
standing
before
him
and
looking
him
in
the
face
it
is
too
dangerous
why
should
you
run
such
risk
let
us
go
to
burma
you
shall
be
my
vizier
i
would
wish
for
nothing
better
he
said
were
it
not
that
i
am
resolved
to
go
to
england
my
mind
is
set
upon
it
and
when
i
have
done
london
shall
have
something
to
talk
about
for
years
to
come
if
you
are
determined
i
will
say
no
more
she
answered
but
when
it
is
over
and
you
are
free
we
will
talk
again
you
will
not
forget
about
the
money
he
asked
anxiously
she
stamped
her
foot
money
money
money
she
cried
it
is
always
the
money
of
which
you
think
but
you
shall
have
it
never
fear
and
now
when
shall
i
see
you
again
in
six
months
time
at
a
place
of
which
i
will
tell
you
beforehand
it
is
a
long
time
to
wait
there
is
a
necklace
worth
five
lacs
to
pay
you
for
the
waiting
then
i
will
be
patient
little
friend
he
said
and
then
as
if
he
thought
he
had
not
said
enough
he
added
think
sometimes
of
simon
carne
she
promised
with
many
pretty
speeches
to
do
so
after
which
he
left
the
room
and
went
downstairs
as
he
reached
the
bottom
step
he
heard
a
cough
in
the
dark
above
him
and
looked
up
he
could
just
distinguish
liz
leaning
over
the
rail
then
something
dropped
and
rattled
upon
the
wooden
steps
behind
him
he
picked
it
up
to
find
that
it
was
an
antique
ring
set
with
rubies
wear
it
that
it
may
bring
thee
luck
she
cried
and
then
disappeared
again
he
put
the
present
on
his
finger
and
went
out
into
the
dark
square
the
money
is
found
he
said
as
he
looked
up
at
the
starlit
heavens
hiram
singh
and
wajib
baksh
are
to
be
discovered
before
noon
his
excellency
the
viceroy
and
his
amiable
lady
have
promised
to
stand
sponsors
for
me
in
london
society
if
with
these
advantages
i
don
t
succeed
well
all
i
can
say
is
i
don
t
deserve
to
now
where
is
my
babuji
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
figure
appeared
from
the
shadow
of
the
building
and
approached
him
if
the
sahib
will
permit
me
i
will
guide
him
by
a
short
road
to
his
hotel
lead
on
then
i
am
tired
and
it
is
time
i
was
in
bed
then
to
himself
he
added
i
must
sleep
for
there
are
great
things
toward
iii
duchess
of
wiltshire
s
diamonds
to
the
reflective
mind
the
rapidity
with
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
s
greatest
city
seize
upon
a
new
name
or
idea
and
familiarize
themselves
with
it
can
scarcely
prove
otherwise
than
astonishing
as
an
illustration
of
my
meaning
let
me
take
the
case
of
klimo
the
now
famous
private
detective
who
has
won
for
himself
the
right
to
be
considered
as
great
as
lecocq
or
even
the
late
lamented
sherlock
holmes
up
to
a
certain
morning
london
had
never
even
heard
his
name
nor
had
it
the
remotest
notion
as
to
who
or
what
he
might
be
it
was
as
sublimely
ignorant
and
careless
on
the
subject
as
the
inhabitants
of
kamtchatka
or
peru
within
hours
however
the
whole
aspect
of
the
case
was
changed
the
man
woman
or
child
who
had
not
seen
his
posters
or
heard
his
name
was
counted
an
ignoramus
unworthy
of
intercourse
with
human
beings
princes
became
familiar
with
it
as
their
trains
bore
them
to
windsor
to
luncheon
with
the
queen
the
nobility
noticed
and
commented
upon
it
as
they
drove
about
the
town
merchants
and
business
men
generally
read
it
as
they
made
they
ways
by
omnibus
or
underground
to
their
various
shops
and
street
boys
called
each
other
by
it
as
a
nickname
music
hall
artists
introduced
it
into
their
patter
while
it
was
even
rumored
that
the
stock
exchange
itself
has
paused
in
the
full
flood
tide
of
business
to
manufacture
a
riddle
on
the
subject
that
klimo
made
his
profession
pay
him
well
was
certain
first
from
the
fact
that
his
advertisements
must
have
cost
a
good
round
sum
and
second
because
he
had
taken
a
mansion
in
belverton
street
park
lane
next
door
to
porchester
house
where
to
the
dismay
of
that
aristocratic
neighborhood
he
advertised
that
he
was
prepared
to
receive
and
be
consulted
by
his
clients
the
invitation
was
responded
to
with
alacrity
and
from
that
day
forward
between
the
hours
of
twelve
and
two
the
pavement
upon
the
north
side
of
the
street
was
lined
with
carriages
every
one
containing
some
person
desirous
of
testing
the
great
man
s
skill
i
must
here
explain
that
i
have
narrated
all
this
in
order
to
show
the
state
of
affairs
existing
in
belverton
street
and
park
lane
when
simon
carne
arrived
or
was
supposed
to
arrive
in
england
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
it
was
on
wednesday
the
of
may
that
the
earl
of
amberley
drove
to
victoria
to
meet
and
welcome
the
man
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
in
india
under
such
peculiar
circumstances
and
under
the
spell
of
whose
fascination
he
and
his
family
had
fallen
so
completely
reaching
the
station
his
lordship
descended
from
his
carriage
and
made
his
way
to
the
platform
set
apart
for
the
reception
of
the
continental
express
he
walked
with
a
jaunty
air
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
himself
and
the
world
in
general
how
little
he
suspected
the
existence
of
the
noose
into
which
he
was
so
innocently
running
his
head
as
if
out
of
compliment
to
his
arrival
the
train
put
in
an
appearance
within
a
few
moments
of
his
reaching
the
platform
he
immediately
placed
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
make
sure
of
seeing
the
man
he
wanted
and
waited
patiently
until
he
should
come
in
sight
carne
however
was
not
among
the
first
batch
indeed
the
majority
of
passengers
had
passed
before
his
lordship
caught
sight
of
him
one
thing
was
very
certain
however
great
the
crush
might
have
been
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
mistake
carne
s
figure
the
man
s
infirmity
and
the
peculiar
beauty
of
his
face
rendered
him
easily
recognizable
possibly
after
his
long
sojourn
in
india
he
found
the
morning
cold
for
he
wore
a
long
fur
coat
the
collar
of
which
he
had
turned
up
around
his
ears
thus
making
a
fitting
frame
for
his
delicate
face
on
seeing
lord
amberley
he
hastened
forward
to
greet
him
this
is
most
kind
and
friendly
of
you
he
said
as
he
shook
the
other
by
the
hand
a
fine
day
and
lord
amberley
to
meet
me
one
could
scarcely
imagine
a
better
welcome
as
he
spoke
one
of
his
indian
servants
approached
and
salaamed
before
him
he
gave
him
an
order
and
received
an
answer
in
hindustani
whereupon
he
turned
again
to
lord
amberley
you
may
imagine
how
anxious
i
am
to
see
my
new
dwelling
he
said
my
servant
tells
me
that
my
carriage
is
here
so
may
i
hope
that
you
will
drive
back
with
me
and
see
for
yourself
how
i
am
likely
to
be
lodged
i
shall
be
delighted
said
lord
amberley
who
was
longing
for
an
opportunity
and
they
accordingly
went
out
into
the
station
yard
together
to
discover
a
brougham
drawn
by
two
magnificent
horses
and
with
nur
ali
in
all
the
glory
of
white
raiment
and
crested
turban
on
the
box
waiting
to
receive
them
his
lordship
dismissed
his
victoria
and
when
jowur
singh
had
taken
his
place
beside
his
upon
the
box
the
carriage
rolled
out
of
the
station
yard
in
the
direction
of
hyde
park
i
trust
her
ladyship
is
quite
well
said
simon
carne
politely
as
they
turned
into
gloucester
place
excellently
well
thank
you
replied
his
lordship
she
bade
me
welcome
you
to
england
in
her
name
as
well
as
my
own
and
i
was
to
say
that
she
is
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
she
is
most
kind
and
i
shall
do
myself
the
honor
of
calling
upon
her
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
permit
answered
carne
i
beg
you
will
convey
my
best
thanks
to
her
for
her
thought
of
me
while
these
polite
speeches
were
passing
between
them
they
were
rapidly
approaching
a
large
billboard
on
which
was
displayed
a
poster
getting
forth
the
name
of
the
now
famous
detective
klimo
simon
carne
leaning
forward
studied
it
and
when
they
had
passed
turned
to
his
friend
again
at
victoria
and
on
all
the
bill
boards
we
met
i
see
an
enormous
placard
bearing
the
word
pray
what
does
it
mean
his
lordship
laughed
you
are
asking
a
question
which
a
month
ago
was
on
the
lips
of
nine
out
of
every
ten
londoners
it
is
only
within
the
last
fortnight
that
we
have
learned
who
and
what
klimo
is
and
pray
what
is
he
well
the
explanation
is
very
simple
he
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
remarkably
astute
private
detective
who
has
succeeded
in
attracting
notice
in
such
a
way
that
half
london
has
been
induced
to
patronize
him
i
have
had
dealings
with
the
man
myself
but
a
friend
of
mine
lord
orpington
has
been
the
victim
of
a
most
audacious
burglary
and
the
police
having
failed
to
solve
the
mystery
he
has
called
klimo
in
we
shall
therefore
see
what
he
can
do
before
many
days
are
past
but
there
i
expect
you
will
soon
know
more
about
him
than
any
of
us
indeed
and
why
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
has
taken
no
belverton
terrace
the
house
adjoining
your
own
and
sees
his
clients
there
simon
carne
pursed
up
his
lips
and
appeared
to
be
considering
something
i
trust
he
will
not
prove
a
nuisance
he
said
at
last
the
agents
who
found
me
the
house
should
have
acquainted
me
with
the
fact
private
detectives
on
however
large
a
scale
scarcely
strike
one
as
the
most
desirable
of
neighbors
particularly
for
a
man
who
is
so
fond
of
quiet
as
myself
at
this
moment
they
were
approaching
their
destination
as
the
carriage
passed
belverton
street
and
pulled
up
lord
amberley
pointed
to
a
long
line
of
vehicles
standing
before
the
detective
s
door
you
can
see
for
yourself
something
of
the
business
he
does
he
said
those
are
the
carriages
of
his
clients
and
it
is
probable
that
twice
as
many
have
arrived
on
foot
i
shall
certainly
speak
to
the
agent
on
the
subject
said
carne
with
a
show
of
annoyance
upon
his
face
i
consider
the
fact
of
this
man
s
being
so
close
to
me
a
serious
drawback
to
the
house
jowur
singh
here
descended
from
the
box
and
opened
the
door
in
order
that
his
master
and
his
guest
might
alight
while
portly
ram
gafur
the
butler
came
down
the
steps
and
salaamed
before
them
with
oriental
obsequiousness
carne
greeted
his
domestics
with
kindly
condescension
and
then
accompanied
by
the
entered
his
new
abode
i
think
you
may
congratulate
yourself
upon
having
secured
one
of
the
most
desirable
residences
in
london
said
his
lordship
ten
minutes
or
so
later
when
they
had
explored
the
principal
rooms
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
carne
i
trust
your
lordship
will
remember
that
you
will
always
be
welcome
in
the
house
as
long
as
i
am
its
owner
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
returned
lord
amberley
warmly
i
shall
look
forward
to
some
months
of
pleasant
intercourse
and
now
i
must
be
going
perhaps
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
you
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
dinner
your
fame
has
already
gone
abroad
and
we
shall
ask
one
or
two
nice
people
to
meet
you
including
my
brother
and
lord
and
lady
gelpington
lord
and
lady
orpington
and
my
cousin
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
whose
interest
in
china
and
indian
art
as
perhaps
you
know
is
only
second
to
your
own
i
shall
be
more
glad
to
come
we
may
count
on
seeing
you
in
eaton
square
then
at
eight
o
clock
if
i
am
alive
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
be
there
must
you
really
go
then
and
many
thanks
for
meeting
me
his
lordship
having
left
the
house
simon
carne
went
upstairs
to
his
dressing
room
which
it
was
to
be
noticed
he
found
without
inquiry
and
rang
the
electric
bell
beside
the
fireplace
three
times
while
he
was
waiting
for
it
to
be
answered
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
long
line
of
carriages
in
the
street
below
everything
is
progressing
admirably
he
said
to
himself
amberley
does
not
suspect
any
more
than
the
world
in
general
as
a
proof
he
asks
me
to
dinner
evening
to
meet
his
brother
and
two
of
his
particular
friends
and
above
all
her
grace
of
wiltshire
of
course
i
shall
go
and
when
i
bid
her
grace
it
will
be
strange
if
i
am
not
one
step
nearer
the
interest
on
liz
s
money
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
his
valet
the
grave
and
respectable
belton
entered
the
room
carne
turned
to
greet
him
impatiently
come
come
belton
he
said
we
must
be
quick
it
is
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
and
if
we
don
t
hurry
the
folk
next
door
will
become
impatient
have
you
succeeded
in
doing
what
i
spoke
to
you
about
last
night
i
have
done
everything
sir
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
now
lock
that
door
and
let
us
get
to
work
you
can
let
me
have
your
news
while
i
am
dressing
opening
one
side
of
the
massive
wardrobe
that
completely
filled
one
end
of
the
room
belton
took
from
it
a
number
of
garments
they
included
a
velvet
coat
a
baggy
pair
of
trousers
so
old
that
only
a
notorious
pauper
or
a
millionaire
could
have
afforded
to
wear
them
a
flannel
waistcoat
a
gladstone
collar
a
soft
silk
tie
and
a
pair
of
embroidered
carpet
slippers
upon
which
no
old
clothes
man
in
the
most
reckless
way
of
business
in
petticoat
lane
would
have
advanced
a
single
into
these
he
assisted
his
master
to
change
now
give
me
the
wig
and
unfasten
the
straps
of
this
hump
said
carne
as
the
other
placed
the
garments
just
referred
to
upon
a
neighboring
chair
belton
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
then
there
happened
a
thing
the
like
of
which
no
one
would
have
believed
having
unbuckled
a
strap
on
either
shoulder
and
slipped
his
hand
beneath
the
waistcoat
he
withdrew
a
large
hump
which
he
carried
away
and
carefully
placed
in
a
drawer
of
the
bureau
relieved
of
his
burden
simon
carne
stood
up
as
straight
and
a
man
as
any
in
her
majesty
s
dominions
the
malformation
for
which
so
many
including
the
earl
and
countess
of
amberley
had
often
pitied
him
was
nothing
but
a
hoax
intended
to
produce
an
effect
which
would
permit
him
additional
facilities
of
disguise
the
hump
discarded
and
the
grey
wig
fitted
carefully
to
his
head
in
such
a
manner
that
not
even
a
pinch
of
his
own
curly
locks
could
be
seen
beneath
it
he
adorned
his
cheeks
with
a
pair
of
whiskers
donned
the
flannel
vest
and
the
velvet
coat
previously
mentioned
slipped
his
feet
into
the
carpet
slippers
placed
a
pair
of
smoked
glasses
upon
his
nose
and
declared
himself
ready
to
proceed
about
his
business
the
man
who
would
have
known
him
for
simon
carne
would
have
been
as
astute
as
well
shall
we
say
as
the
private
detective
klimo
himself
it
s
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
he
said
as
he
gave
a
final
glance
at
himself
in
the
above
the
and
arranged
his
tie
to
his
satisfaction
should
any
one
call
instruct
ram
gafur
to
tell
them
that
i
have
gone
out
on
business
and
shall
not
be
back
until
three
o
clock
very
good
sir
now
undo
the
door
and
let
me
go
in
thus
commanded
belton
went
across
to
the
large
wardrobe
which
as
i
have
already
said
covered
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
room
and
opened
the
middle
door
two
or
three
garments
were
seen
inside
suspended
on
pegs
and
these
he
removed
at
the
same
time
pushing
towards
the
right
the
panel
at
the
rear
when
this
was
done
a
large
aperture
in
the
wall
between
the
two
houses
was
disclosed
through
this
door
carne
passed
drawing
it
behind
him
in
no
belverton
terrace
the
house
occupied
by
the
detective
whose
presence
in
the
street
carne
seemed
to
find
so
objectionable
the
entrance
thus
constructed
was
covered
by
the
peculiar
kind
of
confessional
box
in
which
klimo
invariably
sat
to
receive
his
clients
the
rearmost
panels
of
which
opened
in
the
same
fashion
as
those
in
the
wardrobe
in
the
dressing
room
these
being
pulled
aside
he
had
but
to
draw
them
to
again
after
him
take
his
seat
ring
the
electric
bell
to
inform
his
housekeeper
that
he
was
ready
and
then
welcome
his
clients
as
quickly
as
they
cared
to
come
punctually
at
two
o
clock
the
interviews
ceased
and
klimo
having
reaped
an
excellent
harvest
of
fees
returned
to
portchester
house
to
become
simon
carne
once
more
possibly
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
earl
and
countess
of
amberley
were
brimming
over
with
his
praise
or
it
may
have
been
the
rumor
that
he
was
worth
as
many
millions
as
you
have
fingers
upon
your
hand
that
did
it
one
thing
however
was
within
hours
of
the
noble
earl
s
meeting
him
at
victoria
station
simon
carne
was
the
talk
not
only
fashionable
but
also
of
unfashionable
london
that
his
household
were
with
one
exception
natives
of
india
that
he
had
paid
a
rental
for
portchester
house
which
ran
into
five
figures
that
he
was
the
greatest
living
authority
upon
china
and
indian
art
generally
and
that
he
had
come
over
to
england
in
search
of
a
wife
were
among
the
smallest
of
the
set
afloat
concerning
him
during
dinner
next
evening
carne
put
forth
every
effort
to
please
he
was
placed
on
the
right
hand
of
his
hostess
and
next
to
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
to
the
latter
he
paid
particular
attention
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
when
the
ladies
returned
to
the
afterwards
her
grace
was
full
of
his
praises
they
had
discussed
china
of
all
sorts
carne
had
promised
her
a
specimen
which
she
had
longed
for
all
her
life
but
had
never
been
able
to
obtain
and
in
return
she
had
promised
to
show
him
the
quaintly
carved
indian
casket
in
which
the
famous
necklace
of
which
he
had
of
course
heard
spent
most
of
its
time
she
would
be
wearing
the
jewels
in
question
at
her
own
ball
in
a
week
s
time
she
informed
him
and
if
he
would
care
to
see
the
case
when
it
came
from
her
bankers
on
that
day
she
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
show
it
to
him
as
simon
carne
drove
home
in
his
luxurious
brougham
afterwards
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
the
success
which
was
attending
his
first
endeavor
two
of
the
guests
who
were
stewards
of
the
jockey
club
had
heard
with
delight
his
idea
of
purchasing
a
horse
in
order
to
have
an
interest
in
the
derby
while
another
on
hearing
that
he
desired
to
become
the
possessor
of
a
yacht
had
offered
to
propose
him
for
the
to
crown
it
all
however
and
much
better
than
all
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
had
promised
to
show
him
her
famous
diamonds
by
this
time
next
week
he
said
to
himself
liz
s
interest
should
be
considerably
closer
but
satisfactory
as
my
progress
has
been
hitherto
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
i
am
to
get
possession
of
the
stones
from
what
i
have
been
able
to
discover
they
are
only
brought
from
the
bank
on
the
day
the
duchess
intends
to
wear
them
and
they
are
taken
back
by
his
grace
the
morning
following
while
she
has
got
them
on
her
person
it
would
be
manifestly
impossible
to
get
them
from
her
and
as
when
she
takes
them
off
they
are
returned
to
their
box
and
placed
in
a
safe
constructed
in
the
wall
of
the
bedroom
adjoining
and
which
for
the
occasion
is
occupied
by
the
butler
and
one
of
the
under
footmen
the
only
key
being
in
the
possession
of
the
duke
himself
it
would
be
equally
foolish
to
hope
to
appropriate
them
in
what
manner
therefore
i
am
to
become
their
possessor
passes
my
comprehension
however
one
thing
is
certain
obtained
they
must
be
and
the
attempt
mast
be
made
on
the
night
of
the
ball
if
possible
in
the
meantime
i
ll
set
my
wits
to
work
upon
a
plan
next
day
simon
carne
was
the
recipient
of
an
invitation
to
the
ball
in
question
and
two
days
later
he
called
upon
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
at
her
residence
in
belgrave
square
with
a
plan
prepared
he
also
took
with
him
the
small
vase
he
had
promised
her
four
nights
before
she
received
him
most
graciously
and
their
talk
fell
at
once
into
the
usual
channel
having
examined
her
collection
and
charmed
her
by
means
of
one
or
two
judicious
criticisms
he
asked
permission
to
include
photographs
of
certain
of
her
treasures
in
his
forthcoming
book
then
little
by
little
he
skillfully
guided
the
conversation
on
to
the
subject
of
jewels
since
we
are
discussing
gems
carne
she
said
perhaps
it
would
interest
you
to
see
my
famous
necklace
by
good
fortune
i
have
it
in
the
house
now
for
the
reason
that
an
alteration
is
being
made
to
one
of
the
clasps
by
my
jewellers
i
should
like
to
see
it
immensely
answered
carne
at
one
time
and
another
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
examine
the
jewels
of
the
leading
indian
princes
and
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
have
seen
the
famous
wiltshire
necklace
then
you
snail
certainly
have
the
honor
she
answered
with
a
smile
if
you
will
ring
that
bell
i
will
send
for
it
carne
rang
the
bell
as
requested
and
when
the
butler
entered
he
was
given
the
key
of
the
safe
and
ordered
to
bring
the
case
to
the
we
must
not
keep
it
very
long
she
observed
while
the
man
was
absent
it
is
to
be
returned
to
the
bank
in
an
hour
s
time
i
am
indeed
fortunate
carne
replied
and
turned
to
the
description
of
some
curious
indian
wood
carving
of
which
he
was
making
a
special
feature
in
his
book
as
he
explained
he
had
collected
his
illustrations
from
the
doors
of
indian
temples
from
the
gateways
of
palaces
from
old
brass
work
and
even
from
carved
chairs
and
boxes
he
had
picked
up
in
all
sorts
of
odd
corners
her
grace
was
most
interested
how
strange
that
you
should
have
mentioned
it
she
said
if
carved
boxes
have
any
interest
for
you
it
is
possible
my
jewel
case
itself
may
be
of
use
to
you
as
i
think
i
told
you
during
lady
amberley
s
dinner
it
came
from
benares
and
has
carved
upon
it
the
portraits
of
nearly
every
god
in
the
hindu
pantheon
you
raise
my
curiosity
to
fever
heat
said
carne
a
few
moments
later
the
servant
returned
bringing
with
him
a
wooden
box
about
sixteen
inches
long
by
twelve
wide
and
eight
deep
which
he
placed
upon
a
table
beside
his
mistress
after
which
he
retired
this
is
the
case
to
which
i
have
just
been
referring
said
the
duchess
placing
her
hand
on
the
article
in
question
if
you
glance
at
it
you
will
see
how
exquisitely
it
is
carved
concealing
his
eagerness
with
an
effort
simon
carne
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
examined
the
box
it
was
with
justice
she
had
described
it
as
a
work
of
art
what
the
wood
was
of
which
it
was
constructed
carne
was
unable
to
tell
it
was
dark
and
heavy
and
though
it
was
not
teak
it
closely
resembled
it
it
was
literally
covered
with
quaint
carving
and
of
its
kind
was
an
unique
work
of
art
it
is
most
curious
and
beautiful
said
carne
when
he
had
finished
his
examination
in
all
my
experience
i
can
safely
say
i
have
never
seen
its
equal
if
you
will
permit
me
i
should
very
much
like
to
include
a
description
and
an
illustration
of
it
in
my
book
of
course
you
may
do
so
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
answered
her
grace
if
it
will
help
you
in
your
work
i
shall
be
glad
to
lend
it
to
you
for
a
few
hours
in
order
that
you
may
have
the
illustration
made
this
was
exactly
what
carne
had
been
waiting
for
and
accepted
the
offer
with
alacrity
very
well
then
she
said
on
the
day
of
my
ball
when
it
will
be
brought
from
the
bank
again
i
will
take
the
necklace
out
and
send
the
case
to
you
i
must
make
one
proviso
however
and
that
is
that
you
let
me
have
it
back
the
same
day
i
will
certainly
promise
to
do
that
replied
carne
and
now
let
us
look
inside
said
his
hostess
choosing
a
key
from
a
bunch
carried
in
her
pocket
she
unlocked
the
casket
and
lifted
the
lid
accustomed
as
carne
had
all
his
life
been
to
the
sight
of
gems
what
he
then
saw
before
him
almost
took
his
breath
away
the
inside
of
the
box
both
sides
and
bottom
was
quilted
with
the
softest
russia
leather
and
on
this
luxurious
couch
reposed
the
famous
necklace
the
fire
of
the
stones
when
the
light
caught
them
was
sufficient
to
dazzle
the
eyes
so
fierce
was
it
as
carne
could
see
every
gem
was
perfect
of
its
kind
and
there
were
no
fewer
than
three
hundred
of
them
the
setting
was
a
fine
example
of
the
jeweller
s
art
and
last
but
not
least
the
value
of
the
whole
affair
was
fifty
thousand
pounds
a
mere
to
the
man
who
had
given
it
to
his
wife
but
a
fortune
to
any
humbler
person
and
now
that
you
have
seen
my
property
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
the
duchess
as
she
watched
her
visitor
s
face
it
is
very
beautiful
he
answered
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
are
proud
of
it
yes
the
diamonds
are
very
fine
but
i
think
it
is
their
that
fascinates
me
more
have
you
any
objection
to
my
measuring
it
pray
do
so
if
it
s
likely
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
replied
her
grace
carne
thereupon
produced
a
small
ivory
rule
ran
it
over
the
box
and
the
figures
he
thus
obtained
he
jotted
down
in
his
ten
minutes
later
when
the
case
had
been
returned
to
the
safe
he
thanked
the
duchess
for
her
kindness
and
took
his
departure
promising
to
call
in
person
for
the
empty
case
on
the
morning
of
the
ball
reaching
home
he
passed
into
his
study
and
seating
himself
at
his
pulled
a
sheet
of
towards
him
and
began
to
sketch
as
well
as
he
could
remember
it
the
box
he
had
seen
then
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
i
have
cracked
a
good
many
hard
nuts
in
my
time
he
said
reflectively
but
never
one
that
seemed
so
difficult
at
first
sight
as
this
as
far
as
i
see
at
present
the
case
stands
as
follows
the
box
will
be
brought
from
the
bank
where
it
usually
reposes
to
wiltshire
house
on
the
morning
of
the
dance
i
shall
be
allowed
to
have
possession
of
it
without
the
stones
of
course
for
a
period
possibly
extending
from
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
four
or
five
at
any
rate
not
later
than
seven
in
the
evening
after
the
ball
the
necklace
will
be
returned
to
it
when
it
will
be
locked
up
in
the
safe
over
which
the
butler
and
a
footman
will
mount
guard
to
get
into
the
room
during
the
night
is
not
only
too
risky
but
physically
out
of
the
question
while
to
rob
her
grace
of
her
treasure
during
the
progress
of
the
dance
would
be
equally
impossible
the
duke
fetches
the
casket
and
takes
it
back
to
the
bank
himself
so
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
i
am
almost
as
far
off
the
solution
as
ever
went
by
and
found
him
still
seated
at
his
desk
staring
at
the
drawing
on
the
paper
then
an
hour
the
traffic
of
the
streets
rolled
past
the
house
unheeded
finally
jowur
singh
announced
his
carriage
and
feeling
that
an
idea
might
come
to
him
with
a
change
of
scene
he
set
off
for
a
drive
in
the
park
by
this
time
his
elegant
mail
phaeton
with
its
magnificent
horses
and
indian
servant
on
the
seat
behind
was
as
well
known
as
her
majesty
s
state
equipage
and
attracted
almost
as
much
attention
however
the
fashionable
world
noticed
that
simon
carne
looked
he
was
still
working
out
his
problem
but
so
far
without
much
success
suddenly
something
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
say
what
put
an
idea
into
his
head
the
notion
was
no
sooner
born
in
his
brain
than
he
left
the
park
and
drove
quickly
home
ten
minutes
had
scarcely
elapsed
before
he
was
back
in
his
study
again
and
had
ordered
that
wajib
baksh
should
be
sent
to
him
when
the
man
he
wanted
put
in
an
appearance
carne
handed
him
the
paper
upon
which
he
had
made
the
drawing
of
the
jewel
case
look
at
that
he
said
and
tell
me
what
thou
seest
there
i
see
a
box
answered
the
man
who
by
this
time
was
well
accustomed
to
his
master
s
ways
as
thou
say
st
it
is
a
box
said
carne
the
wood
is
heavy
and
thick
though
what
wood
it
is
i
do
not
know
the
measurements
are
upon
the
paper
below
within
both
the
sides
and
bottom
are
quilted
with
soft
leather
as
i
have
also
shown
think
now
wajib
baksh
for
in
this
case
thou
wilt
need
to
have
all
thy
wits
about
thee
tell
me
is
it
in
thy
power
oh
must
cunning
of
all
craftsmen
to
insert
such
extra
sides
within
this
box
that
they
being
held
by
a
spring
shall
lie
so
snug
as
not
to
be
noticeable
to
the
ordinary
eye
can
it
be
so
arranged
that
when
the
box
is
locked
they
shall
fall
flat
upon
the
bottom
thus
covering
and
holding
fast
what
lies
beneath
them
and
yet
making
the
box
appear
to
the
eye
as
if
it
were
empty
is
it
possible
for
thee
to
do
such
a
thing
wajib
baksh
did
not
reply
for
a
few
moments
his
instinct
told
him
what
his
master
wanted
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
answer
hastily
for
he
also
saw
that
his
reputation
as
the
most
cunning
craftsman
in
india
was
at
stake
if
the
will
permit
me
the
night
for
thought
he
said
at
last
i
will
come
to
him
when
he
rises
from
his
bed
and
tell
him
what
i
can
do
and
he
can
then
give
his
orders
very
good
said
carne
then
morning
i
shall
expect
thy
report
let
the
work
be
good
and
there
will
be
many
rupees
for
thee
to
touch
in
return
as
to
the
lock
and
the
way
it
shall
act
let
that
be
the
concern
of
hiram
singh
wajib
baksli
salaamed
and
withdrew
and
simon
carne
for
the
time
being
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
next
morning
while
he
was
dressing
belton
reported
that
the
two
artificers
desired
an
interview
with
him
he
ordered
them
to
be
admitted
and
forthwith
they
entered
the
room
it
was
noticeable
that
wajib
baksh
carried
in
his
hand
a
heavy
box
which
he
placed
upon
the
table
have
ye
thought
over
the
matter
he
asked
seeing
that
the
men
waited
for
him
to
speak
we
have
thought
of
it
replied
hiram
singh
who
always
acted
as
spokesman
for
the
pair
if
the
presence
will
deign
to
look
he
will
see
that
we
have
made
a
box
of
the
size
and
shape
as
he
drew
upon
the
paper
yes
it
is
certainly
a
good
copy
said
carne
condescendingly
after
he
had
examined
it
wajib
baksh
showed
his
white
teeth
in
appreciation
of
the
compliment
and
hiram
singh
drew
closer
to
the
table
and
now
if
the
sahib
will
open
it
he
will
in
his
wisdom
be
able
to
tell
if
it
resembles
the
other
that
he
has
in
his
mind
carne
opened
the
box
as
requested
and
discovered
that
the
interior
was
an
exact
counterfeit
of
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
s
jewel
case
even
to
the
extent
of
the
quilted
leather
lining
which
had
been
the
other
s
principal
feature
he
admitted
that
the
likeness
was
all
that
could
be
desired
as
he
is
satisfied
said
hiram
singh
it
may
be
that
the
protector
of
the
poor
will
deign
to
try
an
experiment
with
it
see
here
is
a
comb
let
it
be
placed
in
the
box
so
now
he
will
see
what
he
will
see
the
broad
comb
lying
upon
his
was
placed
on
the
bottom
of
the
box
the
lid
was
closed
and
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
case
being
securely
fastened
hiram
singh
laid
it
before
his
master
i
am
to
open
it
i
suppose
said
carne
taking
the
key
and
replacing
it
in
the
lock
if
my
master
pleases
replied
the
other
carne
accordingly
turned
it
in
the
lock
and
having
done
so
raised
the
lid
and
looked
inside
his
astonishment
was
complete
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
box
was
empty
the
comb
was
not
to
be
seen
and
yet
the
quilted
sides
and
bottom
were
to
all
appearances
just
the
same
as
when
he
had
first
looked
inside
this
is
most
wonderful
he
said
and
indeed
it
was
as
clever
a
conjuring
trick
as
any
he
had
ever
seen
nay
it
is
very
simple
wajib
baksh
replied
the
told
me
that
there
must
be
no
risk
of
detection
he
took
the
box
in
his
own
hands
and
running
his
nails
down
the
center
of
the
quilting
divided
the
false
bottom
into
two
pieces
these
he
lifted
out
revealing
the
comb
lying
upon
the
real
bottom
beneath
the
sides
as
my
lord
will
see
said
hiram
singh
taking
a
step
forward
are
held
in
their
appointed
places
by
these
two
springs
thus
when
the
key
is
turned
the
springs
relax
and
the
sides
are
driven
by
others
into
their
places
on
the
bottom
where
the
seams
in
the
quilting
mask
the
join
there
is
but
one
disadvantage
it
is
as
follows
when
the
pieces
which
form
the
bottom
are
lifted
out
in
order
that
my
lord
may
get
at
whatever
lies
concealed
beneath
the
springs
must
of
necessity
stand
revealed
however
to
any
one
who
knows
sufficient
of
the
working
of
the
box
to
lift
out
the
false
bottom
it
will
be
an
easy
matter
to
withdraw
the
springs
and
conceal
them
about
his
person
as
you
say
that
is
an
easy
matter
said
carne
and
i
shall
not
be
likely
to
forget
now
one
other
question
presuming
i
am
in
a
position
to
put
the
real
box
into
your
hands
for
say
eight
hours
do
you
think
that
in
that
time
you
can
fit
it
up
so
that
detection
will
be
impossible
assuredly
my
lord
replied
hiram
singh
with
conviction
there
is
but
the
lock
and
the
fitting
of
the
springs
to
be
done
three
hours
at
most
would
suffice
for
that
i
am
pleased
with
you
said
carne
as
a
proof
of
my
satisfaction
when
the
work
is
finished
you
will
each
receive
five
hundred
rupees
now
you
can
go
according
to
his
promise
ten
o
clock
on
the
friday
following
found
him
in
his
hansom
driving
towards
belgrave
square
he
was
a
little
anxious
though
the
casual
observer
would
scarcely
have
been
able
to
tell
it
the
magnitude
of
the
stake
for
which
he
was
playing
was
enough
to
try
the
nerve
of
even
such
a
past
master
in
his
profession
as
simon
carne
arriving
at
the
house
he
discovered
some
workmen
erecting
an
awning
across
the
footway
in
preparation
for
the
ball
that
was
to
take
place
at
night
it
was
not
long
however
before
he
found
himself
in
the
boudoir
reminding
her
grace
of
her
promise
to
permit
him
an
opportunity
of
making
a
drawing
of
the
famous
jewel
case
the
duchess
was
naturally
busy
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
on
his
way
home
with
the
box
placed
on
the
seat
of
the
carriage
beside
him
now
he
said
as
he
patted
it
if
only
the
notion
worked
out
by
hiram
singh
and
wajib
baksh
holds
good
the
famous
wiltshire
diamonds
will
become
my
property
before
very
many
hours
are
passed
by
this
time
i
suppose
london
will
be
all
agog
concerning
the
burglary
on
reaching
his
house
he
left
his
carriage
and
himself
carried
the
box
into
his
study
once
there
he
rang
his
bell
and
ordered
hiram
singh
and
wajib
baksh
to
be
sent
to
him
when
they
arrived
he
showed
them
the
box
upon
which
they
were
to
exercise
their
ingenuity
bring
your
tools
in
here
he
said
and
do
the
work
under
my
own
eyes
you
have
but
nine
hours
before
you
so
you
must
make
the
most
of
them
the
men
went
for
their
implements
and
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
set
to
work
all
through
the
day
they
were
kept
hard
at
it
with
the
result
that
by
five
o
clock
the
alterations
had
been
effected
and
the
case
stood
ready
by
the
time
carne
returned
from
his
afternoon
drive
in
the
park
it
was
quite
prepared
for
the
part
it
was
to
play
in
his
scheme
having
praised
the
men
he
turned
them
out
and
locked
the
door
then
went
across
the
room
and
unlocked
a
drawer
in
his
from
it
he
took
a
flat
leather
jewel
case
which
he
opened
it
contained
a
necklace
of
counterfeit
diamonds
if
anything
a
little
larger
than
the
one
he
intended
to
try
to
obtain
he
had
purchased
it
that
morning
in
the
burlington
arcade
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
apparatus
his
servants
had
made
and
this
he
now
proceeded
to
do
laying
it
carefully
upon
the
bottom
he
closed
the
lid
and
turned
the
key
when
he
opened
it
again
the
necklace
was
gone
and
even
though
he
knew
the
secret
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
see
where
the
false
bottom
began
and
ended
after
that
he
reset
the
trap
and
tossed
the
necklace
carelessly
in
to
his
delight
it
acted
as
well
as
on
the
previous
occasion
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
satisfaction
his
conscience
was
sufficiently
elastic
to
give
him
no
trouble
to
him
it
was
scarcely
a
robbery
he
was
planning
but
an
artistic
trial
of
skill
in
which
he
pitted
his
wits
and
cunning
against
the
forces
of
society
in
general
at
seven
he
dined
and
afterwards
smoked
a
meditative
cigar
over
the
evening
paper
in
the
the
invitations
to
the
ball
were
for
ten
o
clock
and
at
he
went
to
his
make
me
tidy
as
quickly
as
you
can
he
said
to
belton
when
the
latter
appeared
and
while
you
are
doing
so
listen
to
my
final
instructions
as
you
know
i
am
endeavoring
to
secure
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
s
necklace
all
london
will
resound
with
the
hubbub
and
i
have
been
making
my
plans
in
such
a
way
as
to
arrange
that
klimo
shall
be
the
first
person
consulted
when
the
messenger
calls
if
call
he
does
see
that
the
old
woman
next
door
bids
him
tell
the
duke
to
come
personally
at
twelve
o
clock
do
you
understand
perfectly
sir
very
good
now
give
me
the
jewel
case
and
let
me
be
off
you
need
not
sit
up
for
me
precisely
as
the
clocks
in
the
neighborhood
were
striking
ten
simon
carne
reached
belgrave
square
and
as
he
hoped
found
himself
the
first
guest
his
hostess
and
her
husband
received
him
in
the
of
the
i
come
laden
with
a
thousand
apologies
he
said
as
he
took
her
grace
s
hand
and
bent
over
it
with
that
ceremonious
politeness
which
was
one
of
the
man
s
chief
characteristics
i
am
most
unconscionably
early
i
know
but
i
hastened
here
in
order
that
i
might
personally
return
the
jewel
ease
you
so
kindly
lent
me
i
must
trust
to
your
generosity
to
forgive
me
the
drawings
took
longer
than
i
expected
please
do
not
apologize
answered
her
grace
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
have
brought
the
case
yourself
i
hope
the
illustrations
have
proved
successful
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
them
as
soon
as
they
are
ready
but
i
am
keeping
you
holding
the
box
one
of
my
servants
will
take
it
to
my
room
she
called
a
footman
to
her
and
bade
him
take
the
box
and
place
it
upon
her
before
it
goes
i
must
let
you
see
that
i
have
not
damaged
it
either
externally
or
internally
said
carne
with
a
laugh
it
is
such
a
valuable
case
that
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
it
had
even
received
a
scratch
during
the
time
it
has
been
in
my
possession
so
saying
he
lifted
the
lid
and
allowed
her
to
look
inside
to
all
appearances
it
was
exactly
the
same
as
when
she
had
lent
it
to
him
earlier
in
the
day
you
have
been
most
careful
she
said
and
then
with
an
air
of
banter
she
continued
if
you
desire
it
i
shall
be
pleased
to
give
you
a
certificate
to
that
effect
they
jested
in
this
fashion
for
a
few
moments
after
the
servant
s
departure
during
which
time
carne
promised
to
call
upon
her
the
following
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
and
to
bring
with
him
the
illustrations
he
had
made
and
a
queer
little
piece
of
china
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
pick
up
in
a
dealer
s
shop
the
previous
afternoon
by
this
time
fashionable
london
was
making
its
way
up
the
grand
staircase
and
with
its
appearance
further
conversation
became
impossible
shortly
after
midnight
carne
bade
his
hostess
and
slipped
away
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
evening
s
entertainment
and
if
the
key
of
the
jewel
case
were
not
turned
before
the
jewels
were
placed
in
it
he
was
convinced
they
would
become
his
property
it
speaks
well
for
his
strength
of
nerve
when
i
record
the
fact
that
on
going
to
bed
his
slumbers
were
as
peaceful
and
untroubled
as
those
of
a
little
child
breakfast
was
scarcely
over
next
morning
before
a
hansom
drew
up
at
his
front
door
and
lord
amberley
alighted
he
was
ushered
into
carne
s
presence
forthwith
and
on
seeing
that
the
latter
was
surprised
at
his
early
visit
hastened
to
explain
my
dear
fellow
he
said
as
he
took
possession
of
the
chair
the
other
offered
him
i
have
come
round
to
see
you
on
most
important
business
as
i
told
you
last
night
at
the
dance
when
you
so
kindly
asked
me
to
come
and
see
the
steam
yacht
you
have
purchased
i
had
an
appointment
with
wiltshire
at
nine
this
morning
on
reaching
belgrave
square
i
found
the
whole
house
in
confusion
servants
were
running
hither
and
thither
with
scared
faces
the
butler
was
on
the
borders
of
lunacy
the
duchess
was
hysterical
in
her
boudoir
while
her
husband
was
in
his
study
vowing
vengeance
against
all
the
world
you
alarm
me
said
carne
lighting
a
cigarette
with
a
hand
that
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
what
on
earth
has
happened
i
think
i
might
safely
allow
you
fifty
guesses
and
then
wager
a
hundred
pounds
you
d
not
hit
the
mark
and
yet
in
a
certain
measure
it
concerns
you
concerns
me
good
gracious
what
have
i
done
to
bring
all
this
about
pray
do
not
look
so
alarmed
said
amberley
personally
you
have
done
nothing
indeed
on
second
thoughts
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
right
in
saying
that
it
concerns
you
at
all
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
carne
a
burglary
took
place
at
wiltshire
house
the
famous
necklace
has
good
heavens
you
don
t
say
so
but
i
do
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
as
follows
when
my
cousin
retired
to
her
room
lost
night
after
the
ball
she
unclasped
the
necklace
and
in
her
husband
s
presence
placed
it
carefully
in
her
jewel
case
which
she
locked
that
having
been
done
wiltshire
took
the
box
to
the
room
which
contained
the
safe
and
himself
placed
it
there
locking
the
iron
door
with
his
own
key
the
room
was
occupied
that
night
according
to
custom
by
the
butler
and
one
of
the
footmen
both
of
whom
have
been
in
the
family
since
they
were
boys
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
duke
unlocked
the
safe
and
took
out
the
box
intending
to
convey
it
to
the
bank
as
usual
before
leaving
however
he
placed
it
on
his
and
went
upstairs
to
speak
to
his
wife
he
can
not
remember
exactly
how
long
he
was
absent
but
he
feels
convinced
that
he
was
not
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
very
utmost
their
conversation
finished
she
accompanied
him
where
she
saw
him
take
up
the
case
to
carry
it
to
his
carriage
before
he
left
the
house
however
she
said
i
suppose
you
have
looked
to
see
that
the
necklace
is
all
right
how
could
i
do
so
was
his
reply
you
know
you
possess
the
only
key
that
will
fit
it
she
felt
in
her
pockets
but
to
her
surprise
the
key
was
not
there
if
i
were
a
detective
i
should
say
that
that
is
a
point
to
be
remembered
said
carne
with
a
smile
pray
where
did
she
find
her
keys
upon
her
said
amberley
though
she
has
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
leaving
them
there
well
when
she
had
procured
the
keys
what
happened
why
they
opened
the
box
and
to
their
astonishment
and
dismay
it
jewels
were
gone
good
gracious
what
a
terrible
loss
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
it
can
be
true
and
pray
what
did
they
do
at
first
they
stood
staring
into
the
empty
box
hardly
believing
the
evidence
of
their
own
eyes
stare
how
they
would
however
they
could
not
bring
them
back
the
jewels
had
without
doubt
disappeared
but
when
and
where
the
robbery
had
taken
place
it
was
impossible
to
say
after
that
they
had
up
all
the
servants
and
questioned
them
but
the
result
was
what
they
might
have
foreseen
no
one
from
the
butler
to
the
could
throw
any
light
upon
the
subject
to
this
minute
it
remains
as
great
a
mystery
as
when
they
first
discovered
it
i
am
more
concerned
than
i
can
tell
you
said
carne
how
thankful
i
ought
to
be
that
i
returned
the
case
to
her
grace
last
night
but
in
thinking
of
myself
i
am
forgetting
to
ask
what
has
brought
you
to
me
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
i
hope
you
will
command
me
well
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
have
come
replied
lord
amberley
naturally
they
are
most
anxious
to
have
the
mystery
solved
and
the
jewels
recovered
as
soon
as
possible
wiltshire
wanted
to
send
to
scotland
yard
there
and
then
but
his
wife
and
i
eventually
persuaded
him
to
consult
klimo
as
you
know
if
the
police
authorities
are
called
in
first
he
refuses
the
business
altogether
now
we
thought
as
you
are
his
neighbor
you
might
possibly
be
able
to
assist
us
you
may
be
very
sure
my
lord
i
will
do
everything
that
lies
in
my
power
let
us
go
and
see
him
at
once
as
he
spoke
he
rose
and
threw
what
remained
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fireplace
his
visitor
having
imitated
his
example
they
procured
their
hats
and
walked
round
from
park
lane
into
belverton
street
to
bring
up
at
no
after
they
had
rung
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
to
them
by
the
old
woman
who
invariably
received
the
detective
s
clients
is
klimo
at
home
asked
carne
and
if
so
can
we
see
him
the
old
lady
was
a
little
deaf
and
the
question
had
to
be
repeated
before
she
could
be
made
to
understand
what
was
wanted
as
soon
however
as
she
realized
their
desire
she
informed
them
that
her
master
was
absent
from
town
but
would
be
back
as
usual
at
twelve
o
clock
to
meet
his
clients
what
on
earth
s
to
be
done
said
the
earl
looking
at
his
companion
in
dismay
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
come
back
again
as
i
have
a
most
important
appointment
at
that
hour
do
you
think
you
could
entrust
the
business
to
me
asked
carne
if
so
i
will
make
a
point
of
seeing
him
at
twelve
o
clock
and
could
call
at
wiltshire
house
afterwards
and
tell
the
duke
what
i
have
done
that
s
very
good
of
you
replied
amberley
if
you
are
sure
it
would
not
put
you
to
too
much
trouble
that
would
be
quite
the
best
thing
to
be
done
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
carne
replied
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
help
in
whatever
way
i
can
you
are
very
kind
said
the
other
then
as
i
understand
it
you
are
to
call
up
klimo
at
twelve
o
clock
and
afterwards
let
my
cousins
know
what
you
have
succeeded
in
doing
i
only
hope
he
will
help
us
to
secure
the
thief
we
are
having
too
many
of
these
burglaries
just
now
i
must
catch
this
hansom
and
be
off
and
many
thanks
said
carne
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
the
hansom
having
rolled
away
carne
retraced
his
steps
to
his
own
abode
it
is
really
very
strange
he
muttered
as
he
walked
along
how
often
chance
condescends
to
lend
her
assistance
to
my
little
schemes
the
mere
fact
that
his
grace
left
the
box
unwatched
in
his
study
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
may
serve
to
throw
the
police
off
on
quite
another
scent
i
am
also
glad
that
they
decided
to
open
the
case
in
the
house
for
if
it
had
gone
to
the
bankers
and
had
been
placed
in
the
strongroom
unexamined
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
get
possession
of
the
jewels
at
all
three
hours
later
he
drove
to
wiltshire
house
and
saw
the
duke
the
duchess
was
far
too
much
upset
by
the
catastrophe
to
see
any
one
this
is
really
most
kind
of
you
carne
said
his
grace
when
the
other
had
supplied
an
elaborate
account
of
his
interview
with
klimo
we
are
extremely
indebted
to
you
i
am
sorry
he
can
not
come
before
ten
o
clock
and
that
he
makes
this
stipulation
of
my
seeing
him
alone
for
i
must
confess
i
should
like
to
have
had
some
one
else
present
to
ask
any
questions
that
might
escape
me
but
if
that
s
his
usual
hour
and
custom
well
we
must
abide
by
it
that
s
all
i
hope
he
will
do
some
good
for
this
is
the
greatest
calamity
that
has
ever
befallen
me
as
i
told
you
just
now
it
has
made
my
wife
quite
she
is
confined
to
her
bedroom
and
quite
hysterical
you
do
not
suspect
any
one
i
suppose
inquired
carne
not
a
soul
the
other
answered
the
thing
is
such
a
mystery
that
we
do
not
know
what
to
think
i
feel
convinced
however
that
my
servants
are
as
innocent
as
i
am
nothing
will
ever
make
me
think
them
otherwise
i
wish
i
could
catch
the
fellow
that
s
all
i
d
make
him
suffer
for
the
trick
he
s
played
me
carne
offered
an
appropriate
reply
and
after
a
little
further
conversation
upon
the
subject
bade
the
irate
nobleman
and
left
the
house
from
belgrave
square
he
drove
to
one
of
the
clubs
of
which
he
had
been
elected
a
member
in
search
of
lord
orpington
with
whom
he
had
promised
to
lunch
and
afterwards
took
him
to
a
s
yard
near
greenwich
in
order
to
show
him
the
steam
yacht
he
had
lately
purchased
it
was
close
upon
before
he
returned
to
his
own
residence
he
brought
lord
orpington
with
him
and
they
dined
in
state
together
at
nine
o
clock
the
latter
bade
him
and
at
ten
carne
retired
to
his
and
rang
for
belton
what
have
you
to
report
he
asked
with
regard
to
what
i
bade
you
do
in
belgrave
square
i
followed
your
instructions
to
the
letter
belton
replied
yesterday
morning
i
wrote
to
horniblow
and
jinison
the
house
agents
in
piccadilly
in
the
name
of
colonel
braithwaite
and
asked
for
an
order
to
view
the
residence
to
the
right
of
wiltshire
house
i
asked
that
the
order
might
be
sent
direct
to
the
house
where
the
colonel
would
get
it
upon
his
arrival
this
letter
i
posted
myself
in
basingstoke
as
you
desired
me
to
do
at
nine
o
clock
yesterday
morning
i
dressed
myself
as
much
like
an
elderly
army
officer
as
possible
and
took
a
cab
to
belgrave
square
the
caretaker
an
old
fellow
of
close
upon
seventy
years
of
age
admitted
me
immediately
upon
hearing
my
name
and
proposed
that
he
should
show
me
over
the
house
this
however
i
told
him
was
quite
unnecessary
backing
my
speech
with
a
present
of
whereupon
he
returned
to
his
breakfast
perfectly
satisfied
while
i
wandered
about
the
house
at
my
own
leisure
reaching
the
same
floor
as
that
upon
which
is
situated
the
room
in
which
the
duke
s
safe
is
kept
i
discovered
that
your
supposition
was
quite
correct
and
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
man
by
opening
the
window
to
make
his
way
along
the
coping
from
one
house
to
the
other
without
being
seen
i
made
certain
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
bedroom
in
which
the
butler
slept
and
then
arranged
the
long
telescope
you
gave
me
and
fixed
one
of
my
boots
to
it
by
means
of
the
screw
in
the
end
with
this
i
was
able
to
make
a
regular
succession
of
footsteps
in
the
dust
along
the
ledge
between
one
window
and
the
other
that
done
i
went
again
bade
the
caretaker
and
got
into
my
cab
from
belgrave
square
i
drove
to
the
shop
of
the
whom
you
told
me
you
had
discovered
was
out
of
town
his
assistant
inquired
my
business
and
was
anxious
to
do
what
he
could
for
me
i
told
him
however
that
i
must
see
his
master
personally
as
it
was
about
the
sale
of
some
diamonds
i
had
had
left
me
i
pretended
to
be
annoyed
that
he
was
not
at
home
and
muttered
to
myself
so
that
the
man
could
hear
something
about
its
meaning
a
journey
to
amsterdam
then
i
limped
out
of
the
shop
paid
off
my
cab
and
walking
down
a
removed
my
moustache
and
altered
my
appearance
by
taking
off
my
and
muffler
a
few
streets
further
on
i
purchased
a
bowler
hat
in
place
of
the
topper
i
had
hitherto
been
wearing
and
then
took
a
cab
from
piccadilly
and
came
home
you
have
fulfilled
my
instructions
admirably
said
carne
and
if
the
business
comes
off
as
i
expect
it
will
you
shall
receive
your
usual
percentage
now
i
must
be
turned
into
klimo
and
be
off
to
belgrave
square
to
put
his
grace
of
wiltshire
upon
the
track
of
this
burglar
before
he
retired
to
rest
that
night
simon
carne
took
something
wrapped
in
a
red
silk
handkerchief
from
the
capacious
pocket
of
the
coat
klimo
had
been
wearing
a
few
moments
before
having
unrolled
the
covering
he
held
up
to
the
light
the
magnificent
necklace
which
for
so
many
years
had
been
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
ducal
house
of
wiltshire
the
electric
light
played
upon
it
and
touched
it
with
a
thousand
different
hues
where
so
many
have
failed
he
said
to
himself
as
he
wrapped
it
in
the
handkerchief
again
and
locked
it
in
his
safe
it
is
pleasant
to
be
able
to
congratulate
oneself
on
having
succeeded
it
is
without
its
equal
and
i
don
t
think
i
shall
be
overstepping
the
mark
if
i
say
that
i
think
when
she
receives
it
liz
will
be
glad
she
lent
me
the
money
next
morning
all
london
was
astonished
by
the
news
that
the
famous
wiltshire
diamonds
had
been
stolen
and
a
few
hours
later
carne
learnt
from
an
evening
paper
that
the
detectives
who
had
taken
up
the
case
upon
the
supposed
retirement
from
it
of
klimo
were
still
completely
at
fault
that
evening
he
was
to
entertain
several
friends
to
dinner
they
included
lord
amberley
lord
orpington
and
a
prominent
member
of
the
privy
council
lord
amberley
arrived
late
but
filled
to
overflowing
with
importance
his
friends
noticed
his
state
and
questioned
him
well
gentlemen
he
answered
as
he
took
up
a
commanding
position
upon
the
i
am
in
a
position
to
inform
you
that
klimo
has
reported
upon
the
case
and
the
upshot
of
it
is
that
the
wiltshire
diamond
mystery
is
a
mystery
no
longer
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
others
in
a
chorus
i
mean
that
he
sent
in
his
report
to
wiltshire
this
afternoon
as
arranged
from
what
he
said
the
other
night
after
being
alone
in
the
room
with
the
empty
jewel
case
and
a
magnifying
glass
for
two
minutes
or
so
he
was
in
a
position
to
describe
the
modus
operandi
and
what
is
more
to
put
the
police
on
the
scent
of
the
burglar
and
how
was
it
worked
asked
carne
from
the
empty
house
next
door
replied
the
other
on
the
morning
of
the
burglary
a
man
purporting
to
be
a
retired
army
officer
called
with
an
order
to
view
got
the
caretaker
out
of
the
way
clambered
along
to
wiltshire
house
by
means
of
the
parapet
outside
reached
the
room
during
the
time
the
servants
were
at
breakfast
opened
the
safe
and
abstracted
the
jewels
but
how
did
klimo
find
all
this
out
asked
lord
orpington
by
his
own
inimitable
cleverness
replied
lord
amberley
at
any
rate
it
has
been
proved
that
he
was
correct
the
man
did
make
his
way
from
next
door
and
the
police
have
since
discovered
that
an
individual
answering
to
the
description
given
visited
a
pawnbroker
s
shop
in
the
city
about
an
hour
later
and
stated
that
he
had
diamonds
to
sell
if
that
is
so
it
turns
out
to
be
a
very
simple
mystery
after
all
said
lord
orpington
as
they
began
their
meal
thanks
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
cleverest
detective
in
the
world
remarked
amberley
in
that
case
here
s
a
good
health
to
klimo
said
the
privy
councillor
raising
his
glass
i
will
join
you
in
that
said
simon
carne
here
s
a
very
good
health
to
klimo
and
his
connection
with
the
duchess
of
wiltshire
s
diamonds
may
he
always
be
equally
successful
hear
hear
to
that
replied
his
guests
iv
simon
carne
won
the
derby
it
was
seven
o
clock
on
one
of
the
brightest
mornings
of
all
that
year
the
scene
was
waterloo
station
where
the
earl
of
amberley
lord
orpington
and
the
marquis
of
laverstock
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
main
line
departure
platform
gazing
anxiously
about
them
it
was
evident
from
the
way
they
scrutinized
every
person
who
approached
them
that
they
were
on
the
lookout
for
some
one
this
some
one
ultimately
proved
to
be
simon
carne
who
when
he
appeared
greeted
them
with
considerable
cordiality
at
the
same
time
apologizing
for
his
lateness
in
joining
them
i
think
this
must
be
our
train
he
said
pointing
to
the
carriages
drawn
up
beside
the
platform
on
which
they
stood
at
any
rate
here
is
my
man
by
dint
of
study
he
has
turned
himself
into
a
sort
of
walking
bradshaw
and
he
will
certainly
be
able
to
inform
us
the
inimitable
belton
deferentially
insinuated
that
his
master
was
right
in
his
conjecture
and
then
led
the
way
towards
a
pullman
car
which
had
been
attached
to
the
train
for
the
convenience
of
carne
and
his
guests
they
took
their
seats
and
a
few
moments
later
the
train
moved
slowly
out
of
the
station
carne
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
the
fact
that
he
was
taking
his
friends
down
to
the
stables
of
his
trainer
william
bent
in
order
that
they
might
witness
a
trial
of
his
candidate
for
the
derby
seemed
to
give
him
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
on
reaching
merford
the
little
wayside
station
nearest
the
village
in
which
the
training
stables
were
situated
they
discovered
a
comfortable
conveyance
drawn
up
to
receive
them
the
driver
touched
his
hat
and
stated
that
his
master
was
awaiting
them
on
the
downs
this
proved
to
be
the
case
for
when
they
left
the
and
turned
on
to
the
soft
turf
they
saw
before
them
a
string
of
thoroughbreds
and
the
trainer
himself
mounted
upon
his
white
pony
columbine
bent
said
carne
as
the
latter
rode
up
and
lifted
his
hat
to
himself
and
friends
you
see
we
have
kept
our
promise
and
are
here
to
witness
the
trial
you
said
you
had
arranged
for
us
i
am
glad
to
see
you
sir
bent
replied
and
i
only
hope
that
what
i
am
about
to
show
you
will
prove
of
service
to
you
the
horse
is
as
fit
as
mortal
hands
can
make
him
and
if
he
don
t
do
his
best
for
you
next
week
there
will
be
one
person
surprised
in
england
and
that
one
will
be
myself
as
you
know
sir
the
only
horse
i
dread
is
vulcanite
and
the
fact
can
not
be
denied
that
he
s
a
real
clinker
well
said
carne
when
we
have
seen
our
animal
gallop
we
shall
know
better
how
much
trust
we
are
to
place
in
him
for
my
own
part
i
m
not
afraid
vulcanite
as
you
say
is
a
good
horse
but
if
i
m
not
mistaken
knight
of
malta
is
a
better
surely
this
is
he
coming
toward
us
that
s
him
said
the
trainer
with
a
fine
disregard
for
grammar
there
s
no
mistaking
him
is
there
and
now
if
you
d
care
to
stroll
across
we
ll
see
them
saddle
the
party
accordingly
descended
from
the
carriage
and
walked
across
the
turf
to
the
spot
where
the
four
thoroughbreds
were
being
divested
of
their
sheets
they
made
a
pretty
group
but
even
the
most
inexperienced
critic
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
pick
out
knight
of
malta
as
the
best
among
them
he
was
a
tall
shapely
bay
with
black
points
a
trifle
light
of
flesh
perhaps
but
with
clean
flat
legs
and
low
thighs
sure
evidence
of
the
enormous
propelling
power
he
was
known
to
possess
his
head
was
perfection
itself
though
a
wee
bit
too
if
anything
taken
altogether
he
looked
what
he
was
thoroughbred
every
inch
of
him
the
others
of
the
party
were
gasometer
hydrogen
and
young
romeo
the
being
the
particular
trial
horse
of
the
party
it
was
a
favorite
boast
of
the
trainer
that
the
was
so
reliable
in
his
habits
his
condition
and
his
pace
that
you
would
not
be
far
wrong
to
set
your
watch
by
him
by
the
way
bent
said
carne
as
the
boys
were
lifted
into
their
saddles
what
weights
are
the
horses
carrying
well
sir
young
romeo
carries
lb
gasometer
lb
hydrogen
lb
and
the
knight
lb
the
distance
will
be
the
epsom
course
one
mile
and
half
and
the
best
horse
to
win
now
sir
if
you
re
ready
we
ll
get
to
work
he
turned
to
the
lad
who
was
to
ride
hydrogen
once
you
are
off
you
will
make
the
running
and
bring
them
along
at
your
best
pace
to
the
dip
where
gasometer
will
if
possible
take
it
up
after
that
i
leave
it
to
you
other
boys
to
make
the
best
race
of
it
you
can
you
blunt
calling
up
his
head
lad
go
down
with
them
to
the
post
and
get
them
off
to
as
good
a
start
as
possible
the
horses
departed
and
simon
carne
and
his
friends
accompanied
the
trainer
to
a
spot
where
they
would
see
the
finish
to
the
best
advantage
five
minutes
later
an
ejaculation
from
lord
orpington
told
them
that
the
horses
had
started
each
man
accordingly
clapped
his
glasses
to
his
eyes
and
watched
the
race
before
them
faithful
to
his
instructions
the
lad
on
hydrogen
came
straight
to
the
front
and
led
them
a
cracker
until
they
descended
into
the
slight
dip
which
marked
the
end
of
the
first
then
he
retired
to
the
rear
hopelessly
done
for
and
gasometer
took
up
the
running
with
knight
of
malta
close
alongside
him
and
young
romeo
only
half
a
length
away
as
they
passed
the
mile
post
young
romeo
shot
to
the
front
but
it
soon
became
evident
he
had
not
come
to
stay
good
horse
as
he
was
there
was
a
better
catching
him
hand
over
fist
the
pace
was
all
that
could
be
desired
and
when
knight
of
malta
swept
past
the
group
winner
of
the
trial
by
more
than
his
own
length
the
congratulations
simon
carne
received
were
as
cordial
as
he
could
possibly
desire
what
did
i
tell
you
sir
said
bent
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
upon
his
face
you
see
what
a
good
horse
he
is
there
s
no
mistake
about
that
well
let
us
hope
he
will
do
as
well
a
week
hence
carne
replied
simply
as
he
replaced
his
glasses
in
their
case
amen
to
that
remarked
lord
orpington
and
now
gentlemen
said
the
trainer
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
drive
you
over
to
my
place
to
breakfast
they
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
once
more
and
bent
having
taken
the
reins
in
a
few
moments
they
were
bowling
along
the
towards
a
neat
modern
residence
standing
on
a
slight
eminence
on
the
edge
of
the
downs
this
was
the
trainer
s
own
place
of
abode
the
stables
containing
his
many
precious
charges
lying
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
the
rear
they
were
received
on
the
threshold
by
the
trainer
s
wife
who
welcomed
them
most
heartily
to
merford
the
keen
air
of
the
downs
had
sharpened
their
appetites
and
when
they
sat
down
to
table
they
found
they
were
able
to
do
full
justice
to
the
excellent
fare
provided
for
them
the
meal
at
an
end
they
inspected
the
stables
once
more
carefully
examining
the
derby
candidate
who
seemed
none
the
worse
for
his
morning
s
exertion
and
then
carne
left
his
guests
in
the
big
yard
to
the
enjoyment
of
their
cigars
while
he
accompanied
his
trainer
into
the
house
for
a
few
moments
chat
and
now
sit
down
sir
said
bent
when
they
reached
his
own
sanctum
a
cosy
apartment
half
and
half
office
bearing
upon
its
walls
innumerable
mementoes
of
circumstances
connected
with
the
owner
s
lengthy
turf
experiences
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
with
what
you
saw
this
morning
perfectly
satisfied
said
carne
but
i
should
like
to
hear
exactly
what
you
think
about
the
race
itself
well
sir
as
you
may
imagine
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
it
lately
and
this
the
conclusion
i
have
come
to
if
this
were
an
ordinary
year
i
should
say
that
we
possess
out
and
away
the
best
horse
in
the
race
but
we
must
remember
that
this
is
not
by
any
means
an
ordinary
year
there
s
vulcanite
who
they
tell
me
is
in
the
very
pink
of
condition
and
who
has
beaten
our
horse
each
time
they
have
met
there
s
the
mandarin
who
won
the
two
thousand
this
week
and
who
will
be
certain
to
come
into
greater
favor
as
the
time
shortens
and
the
filibuster
who
won
the
biennial
stakes
at
the
craven
meeting
a
nice
enough
horse
though
i
must
say
i
don
t
fancy
him
myself
i
take
it
then
that
the
only
horse
you
really
fear
is
vulcanite
that
s
so
sir
if
he
were
not
in
the
list
i
should
feel
as
certain
of
seeing
you
leading
your
horse
back
a
winner
as
any
man
could
well
be
on
looking
at
his
watch
carne
discovered
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
rejoin
his
friends
and
be
off
to
the
railway
station
if
they
desired
to
catch
the
train
which
they
had
arranged
should
convey
them
back
to
town
so
bidding
the
trainer
and
his
wife
goodbye
they
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
once
more
and
were
driven
away
arriving
at
waterloo
they
drove
to
lord
orpington
s
club
do
you
know
you
re
a
very
lucky
fellow
carne
said
the
earl
of
amberley
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
of
that
institution
afterwards
before
separating
in
pursuit
of
the
pleasures
of
the
afternoon
you
have
health
wealth
fame
good
looks
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
london
and
now
one
of
the
prospective
winners
of
the
derby
in
fact
you
only
want
one
thing
to
make
your
existence
perfect
and
what
is
that
asked
carne
a
wife
replied
lord
amberley
i
wonder
the
girls
have
let
you
escape
so
long
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
said
carne
how
could
a
fellow
like
myself
who
is
here
and
gone
expect
any
woman
to
link
her
lot
with
his
do
you
remember
our
first
meeting
perfectly
replied
lord
amberley
when
i
close
my
eyes
i
can
see
that
beautiful
marble
palace
set
in
its
frame
of
blue
water
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
i
breakfasted
with
you
there
that
was
a
very
fortunate
morning
for
me
said
the
other
and
now
here
is
my
cab
i
must
be
off
cried
his
friends
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
entered
the
vehicle
don
t
forget
to
let
us
know
if
anything
further
turns
up
i
will
be
sure
to
do
so
said
simon
carne
and
then
as
he
laid
himself
back
on
the
soft
cushions
and
was
driven
by
way
of
waterloo
place
to
piccadilly
he
added
to
himself
yes
if
i
can
bring
off
the
little
scheme
i
have
in
my
mind
and
one
or
two
others
which
i
am
preparing
and
can
manage
to
get
out
of
england
without
any
one
suspecting
that
i
am
the
burglar
who
has
outwitted
all
london
i
shall
have
good
cause
to
say
that
was
a
very
fortunate
day
for
me
when
i
first
met
his
lordship
that
evening
he
dined
alone
he
seemed
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
disappointed
about
something
several
times
on
hearing
noises
in
the
street
outside
he
questioned
his
servants
as
to
the
cause
at
last
however
when
ram
gafur
entered
the
room
carrying
a
telegram
upon
a
salver
his
feelings
found
vent
in
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
with
eager
fingers
he
broke
open
the
envelope
withdrew
the
contents
and
read
the
message
it
contained
seven
stars
music
hall
whitechapel
road
ten
o
clock
there
was
no
signature
but
that
fact
did
not
seem
to
trouble
him
very
much
he
placed
it
in
his
pocketbook
and
afterwards
continued
his
meal
in
better
spirits
when
the
servants
had
left
the
room
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
port
and
taking
a
pencil
proceeded
to
make
certain
calculations
upon
the
back
of
an
envelope
for
nearly
ten
minutes
he
occupied
himself
in
this
way
then
he
tore
the
paper
into
tiny
pieces
replaced
his
pencil
in
his
pocket
and
sipped
his
wine
with
a
satisfaction
that
was
the
outcome
of
perfected
arrangements
the
public
excitement
he
said
to
himself
not
without
a
small
touch
of
pride
has
as
yet
scarcely
cooled
down
from
the
robbery
of
the
famous
wiltshire
jewels
lord
orpington
has
not
as
yet
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
the
gold
and
silver
plate
which
disappeared
from
his
house
so
mysteriously
a
week
or
two
ago
while
several
other
people
have
done
their
best
to
catch
a
gang
of
burglars
who
would
seem
to
have
set
all
london
at
defiance
but
if
i
bring
off
this
new
coup
they
ll
forget
all
their
grievances
in
consideration
of
the
latest
and
greatest
scandal
there
ll
be
scarcely
a
man
in
england
who
won
t
have
something
to
say
upon
the
subject
by
the
way
let
me
see
how
he
stands
in
the
betting
he
took
a
paper
from
the
table
in
the
window
and
glanced
down
the
sporting
column
vulcanite
was
evidently
the
public
s
choice
knight
of
malta
being
the
only
second
favorite
with
the
mandarin
a
strong
third
what
a
hubbub
there
will
be
when
it
becomes
known
said
carne
as
he
placed
the
paper
on
the
table
again
i
shall
have
to
take
especial
care
or
some
of
the
storm
may
blow
back
on
me
i
fancy
i
can
hear
the
newsboys
shouting
latest
news
of
the
turf
scandal
the
derby
favorite
stolen
vulcanite
missing
an
attempt
made
to
get
at
knight
of
why
it
will
be
twenty
years
before
old
england
will
forget
the
sensation
i
am
about
to
give
her
with
a
grim
chuckle
at
the
idea
he
went
upstairs
to
his
and
locked
the
door
it
must
have
been
well
after
nine
o
clock
when
he
emerged
again
and
clad
in
a
long
ulster
left
the
house
in
his
private
hansom
passing
down
park
lane
he
drove
along
piccadilly
then
by
way
of
the
haymarket
strand
ludgate
hill
and
fenchurch
street
to
the
whitechapel
road
reaching
the
corner
of
leman
street
he
signalled
to
his
man
to
stop
and
jumped
out
his
appearance
was
now
entirely
changed
instead
of
the
deformed
figure
he
usually
presented
he
now
resembled
a
commonplace
farmerish
individual
with
hair
a
somewhat
crafty
face
ornamented
with
bushy
eyebrows
and
a
quantity
of
fluffy
whiskers
how
he
had
managed
it
as
he
drove
along
goodness
only
knows
but
that
he
had
effected
the
change
was
certain
having
watched
his
cab
drive
away
he
strolled
along
the
street
until
he
arrived
at
a
building
the
flaring
lights
of
which
proclaimed
it
the
seven
stars
music
hall
he
paid
his
money
at
the
box
office
and
then
walked
inside
to
find
a
building
upon
the
floor
of
which
were
placed
possibly
a
hundred
small
tables
on
the
stage
at
the
further
end
a
young
lady
boasting
of
a
minimum
of
clothing
and
a
maximum
of
was
explaining
to
the
dashing
accompaniment
of
the
orchestra
the
adventures
she
had
experienced
when
billy
and
me
was
courting
acting
up
to
his
appearance
carne
called
for
a
two
of
scotch
cold
and
having
lit
a
meerschaum
pipe
which
he
took
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
prepared
to
make
himself
at
home
as
ten
o
clock
struck
he
turned
his
chair
a
little
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
better
view
of
the
door
and
waited
five
minutes
must
have
elapsed
before
his
patience
was
rewarded
then
two
men
came
in
together
and
immediately
he
saw
them
he
turned
his
face
in
an
opposite
direction
and
seemed
to
be
taking
an
absorbing
interest
in
what
was
happening
upon
the
stage
one
of
the
men
who
had
entered
and
whom
he
had
seemed
to
recognize
a
individual
in
a
suit
of
clothes
a
size
too
small
for
him
a
velvet
waistcoat
at
least
three
sizes
too
large
a
check
tie
in
which
was
stuck
an
enormous
horseshoe
pin
composed
of
palpably
imitation
diamonds
boasting
no
shirt
as
far
as
could
be
seen
and
wearing
upon
his
head
a
top
hat
of
a
shape
that
had
been
fashionable
in
the
early
sixties
stopped
and
placed
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
blenkins
or
i
m
a
d
isy
he
said
well
who
d
ha
thought
of
seeing
you
here
of
all
places
why
it
was
only
this
afternoon
as
me
and
my
friend
brown
here
was
of
you
to
think
as
how
you
should
ha
come
up
to
london
just
this
very
time
and
be
at
the
seven
stars
music
hall
of
all
other
places
it
s
like
what
the
noospapers
call
a
drat
me
if
it
ain
t
ow
are
yer
old
pal
he
extended
his
hand
which
blenkins
took
and
shook
with
considerable
cordiality
after
that
brown
who
from
outward
appearances
was
by
far
the
most
respectable
of
the
trio
was
introduced
in
the
capacity
of
a
gentleman
from
america
a
citizenship
that
became
more
apparent
when
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
what
was
ee
speaking
of
i
about
asked
blenkins
when
the
trio
were
comfortably
seated
at
table

diffident

that
appellative

seedy
gentleman

the
magnificent
diamonds
chose
to
be
called
declined
to
state
it
would
appear
that
he
was
willing
to
discuss
the
news
of
the
day
the
price
of
forage
the
prospects
of
war
the
programme
proceeding
upon
the
stage
in
fact
anything
rather
than
declare
the
subject
of
his
conversation
with
brown
that
afternoon
it
was
not
until
brown
happened
to
ask
blenkins
what
horse
he
fancied
for
the
derby
that
jones
in
any
degree
recovered
his
then
an
animated
discussion
on
the
forthcoming
race
was
entered
upon
how
long
it
would
have
lasted
had
not
jones
presently
declared
that
the
music
of
the
orchestra
was
too
much
for
him
i
can
not
say
thereupon
brown
suggested
that
they
should
leave
the
hall
and
proceed
to
a
place
of
which
he
knew
in
a
neighboring
street
this
they
accordingly
did
and
when
they
were
safely
installed
in
a
small
room
off
the
bar
jones
having
made
certain
that
there
was
no
one
near
enough
to
overhear
unlocked
his
powers
of
conversation
with
whisky
and
water
and
proceeded
to
speak
his
mind
for
upwards
of
an
hour
they
remained
closeted
in
the
room
together
conversing
in
an
undertone
then
the
meeting
broke
up
blenkins
bidding
his
friends
before
they
left
the
house
from
the
outward
appearances
of
the
party
if
in
these
days
of
seedy
millionaires
and
bankrupts
one
may
venture
to
judge
by
them
he
would
have
been
a
speculative
individual
who
would
have
given
a
note
for
the
worldly
wealth
of
the
trio
yet
had
you
taken
so
much
trouble
you
might
have
followed
blenkins
and
have
seen
him
picked
up
by
a
smart
private
hansom
at
the
corner
of
leman
street
you
might
then
have
gone
back
to
the
hen
and
feathers
and
have
followed
brown
as
far
as
osborn
street
and
have
seen
him
enter
a
neat
brougham
which
was
evidently
his
own
private
property
another
hansom
also
a
private
one
met
jones
in
the
same
thoroughfare
and
an
hour
later
two
of
the
number
were
in
park
lane
while
the
third
was
discussing
a
bottle
of
heidseck
in
a
gorgeous
private
on
the
second
floor
of
the
langham
hotel
as
he
entered
his
on
his
return
to
porchester
house
simon
carne
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
exactly
twelve
o
clock
i
hope
belton
will
not
be
long
he
said
to
himself
give
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
rid
himself
of
the
other
fellow
and
say
to
get
home
in
that
case
he
should
be
here
within
the
next
few
minutes
the
thought
had
scarcely
passed
through
his
brain
before
there
was
a
deferential
knock
at
the
door
and
the
next
moment
belton
clad
in
a
long
entered
the
room
you
re
back
sooner
than
i
expected
said
carne
you
could
not
have
stayed
very
long
with
our
friend
i
left
him
soon
after
you
did
sir
said
belton
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
and
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
settle
i
did
not
attempt
to
prevent
him
i
trust
you
are
satisfied
sir
with
the
result
of
our
adventure
perfectly
satisfied
said
carne
i
ll
make
sure
that
he
s
good
for
the
money
and
then
we
ll
get
to
work
in
the
meantime
you
had
better
see
about
a
van
and
the
furniture
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
and
also
engage
a
man
upon
whom
you
can
rely
but
what
about
merford
sir
and
the
attempt
upon
knight
of
malta
i
ll
see
about
that
on
monday
i
have
promised
bent
to
spend
the
night
there
you
ll
excuse
my
saying
so
sir
i
hope
said
belton
as
he
poured
out
his
master
s
hot
water
and
laid
his
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
ready
for
him
to
put
on
but
it
s
a
terrible
risky
business
if
we
don
t
bring
it
off
there
ll
be
such
a
noise
in
england
as
has
never
been
heard
before
you
might
murder
the
prime
minister
i
believe
and
it
wouldn
t
count
for
so
much
with
the
people
generally
as
an
attempt
to
steal
the
derby
favorite
but
we
shall
not
fail
said
carne
confidently
by
this
time
you
ought
to
know
me
better
than
to
suppose
that
no
no
never
fear
belton
i
ve
got
all
my
plans
cut
and
dried
and
even
if
we
fail
to
get
possession
of
vulcanite
the
odds
are
a
thousand
to
one
against
our
being
suspected
of
any
complicity
in
the
matter
now
you
can
go
to
bed
sir
said
belton
respectfully
and
left
the
room
it
was
one
of
simon
carne
s
peculiarities
always
to
fulfill
his
engagements
in
spite
of
any
inconvenience
they
might
cause
himself
accordingly
the
four
o
clock
train
from
waterloo
on
the
monday
following
the
meeting
at
the
music
hall
just
narrated
carried
him
to
merford
in
pursuance
of
the
promise
he
had
given
his
trainer
reaching
the
little
wayside
station
on
the
edge
of
the
downs
he
alighted
to
find
himself
welcomed
by
his
trainer
who
lifted
his
hat
respectfully
and
wished
him
during
the
drive
carne
spoke
of
the
impending
race
and
among
other
things
of
a
letter
he
had
that
morning
received
warning
him
of
an
attempt
that
would
probably
be
made
to
obtain
possession
of
his
good
horse
the
trainer
laughed
bless
you
sir
he
said
that
s
nothing
you
should
just
see
some
of
the
letters
i
ve
got
pasted
into
my
most
of
em
comes
a
week
or
fortnight
before
a
big
race
some
of
em
warns
me
that
if
i
don
t
prevent
the
horse
from
starting
i
m
as
good
as
a
dead
man
others
ask
me
what
price
i
will
take
to
let
him
finish
outside
the
first
three
while
more
still
tell
me
that
if
i
don
t
put
im
out
of
the
way
altogether
i
ll
find
my
house
and
my
wife
and
family
flying
up
to
the
clouds
under
a
full
charge
of
dynamite
within
three
days
of
the
race
being
run
don
t
you
pay
any
attention
to
the
letters
you
receive
i
ll
look
after
the
horse
and
you
may
be
very
sure
i
ll
take
good
care
that
nothing
happens
to
him
i
know
that
of
course
said
carne
but
i
thought
i
d
tell
you
you
see
i
m
only
a
novice
at
racing
and
perhaps
i
place
more
importance
just
now
upon
a
threat
of
that
kind
than
i
shall
do
a
couple
of
years
hence
of
course
replied
the
trainer
i
understand
exactly
how
you
feel
sir
it
s
quite
natural
and
now
here
we
are
with
the
missis
standing
on
the
steps
to
help
me
give
you
a
hearty
welcome
they
drove
up
to
the
door
and
when
carne
had
alighted
he
was
received
by
the
trainer
s
wife
as
her
lord
and
master
had
predicted
his
bedroom
he
discovered
on
being
conducted
to
it
to
prepare
for
dinner
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
overlooking
the
stableyard
and
possessed
a
lovely
view
extending
across
the
gardens
and
village
towards
where
the
downs
ended
and
the
woods
of
herberford
began
a
pretty
room
he
said
to
belton
as
the
latter
laid
out
his
things
upon
the
bed
and
very
convenient
for
our
purpose
have
you
discovered
where
you
are
located
next
door
sir
i
am
glad
of
that
and
what
room
is
beneath
us
the
kitchen
and
pantry
sir
with
the
exception
of
one
at
the
top
of
the
house
there
are
no
other
bedrooms
on
this
side
that
is
excellent
news
now
get
me
ready
as
soon
as
you
can
during
dinner
that
evening
simon
carne
made
himself
as
pleasant
as
possible
to
his
host
and
hostess
so
affable
indeed
was
he
that
when
they
retired
to
rest
they
confessed
to
each
other
that
they
had
never
entertained
a
more
charming
guest
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
be
called
at
five
o
clock
on
the
morning
following
in
order
that
he
might
accompany
the
trainer
to
the
downs
to
see
his
horse
at
his
exercise
it
was
close
upon
eleven
o
clock
when
he
dismissed
his
valet
and
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
with
a
novel
for
upwards
of
two
hours
he
amused
himself
with
his
book
then
he
rose
and
dressed
himself
in
the
rough
suit
which
his
man
had
put
out
for
him
having
done
so
he
took
a
strong
rope
ladder
from
his
bag
blew
out
his
light
and
opened
his
window
to
attach
the
hooks
at
the
end
of
the
ropes
to
the
inside
of
the
and
to
throw
the
rest
outside
was
the
work
of
a
moment
then
having
ascertained
that
his
door
was
securely
locked
he
crawled
out
and
descended
to
the
ground
once
there
he
waited
until
he
saw
belton
s
light
disappear
and
heard
his
window
softly
open
next
moment
a
small
black
bag
was
lowered
and
following
it
by
means
of
another
ladder
came
the
servant
himself
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
said
carne
as
soon
as
they
were
together
you
must
set
to
work
on
the
big
gates
while
i
do
the
other
business
the
men
are
all
asleep
nevertheless
be
careful
that
you
make
no
noise
having
given
his
instructions
he
left
his
servant
and
made
his
way
across
the
yard
towards
the
box
where
knight
of
malta
was
confined
when
he
reached
it
he
unfastened
the
bag
he
had
brought
with
him
and
took
from
it
a
brace
and
a
bit
resembling
a
pair
of
compasses
uniting
these
he
oiled
the
points
and
applied
them
to
the
door
a
little
above
the
lock
what
he
desired
to
do
did
not
occupy
him
for
more
than
a
minute
then
he
went
quietly
along
the
yard
to
the
further
boundary
where
he
had
that
afternoon
noticed
a
short
ladder
by
means
of
this
he
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
wall
then
lifted
it
up
after
him
and
lowered
it
on
the
other
side
still
without
making
any
noise
instead
of
dismounting
by
it
however
he
seated
himself
for
a
moment
astride
of
it
while
he
drew
on
a
pair
of
clumsy
boots
he
had
brought
with
him
suspended
round
his
neck
then
having
chosen
his
place
he
jumped
his
weight
caused
him
to
leave
a
good
mark
on
the
soft
ground
on
the
other
side
he
then
walked
heavily
for
perhaps
fifty
yards
until
he
reached
the
here
he
divested
himself
of
his
boots
put
on
his
list
slippers
once
more
and
returned
as
speedily
as
possible
to
the
ladder
which
he
mounted
and
drew
up
after
him
having
descended
on
the
other
side
he
left
it
standing
against
the
wall
and
hastened
across
the
yard
towards
the
gates
where
he
found
belton
just
finishing
the
work
he
had
set
him
to
do
with
the
aid
of
a
brace
and
bit
similar
to
that
used
by
carne
upon
the
stable
door
the
lock
had
been
entirely
removed
and
the
gate
stood
open
belton
was
evidently
satisfied
with
his
work
carne
however
was
not
so
pleased
he
picked
up
the
circle
of
wood
and
showed
it
to
his
servant
then
taking
the
bit
he
inserted
the
screw
on
the
reverse
side
and
gave
it
two
or
three
turns
you
might
have
ruined
everything
he
whispered
by
omitting
that
the
first
carpenter
who
looked
at
it
would
be
able
to
tell
that
the
work
was
done
from
the
inside
but
thank
goodness
i
know
a
trick
that
will
set
that
right
now
then
give
me
the
pads
and
i
ll
drop
them
by
the
door
then
we
can
return
to
our
rooms
four
large
blanket
pads
were
handed
to
him
and
he
went
quietly
across
and
dropped
them
by
the
stable
door
after
that
he
rejoined
belton
and
they
made
their
way
with
the
assistance
of
the
ladders
back
to
their
own
rooms
once
more
later
carne
was
wrapped
in
a
sweet
slumber
from
which
he
did
not
awake
until
he
was
aroused
by
a
tapping
at
his
chamber
door
it
was
the
trainer
carne
cried
bent
in
what
were
plainly
agitated
tones
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
i
should
be
glad
to
speak
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
in
something
under
twenty
minutes
he
was
dressed
and
downstairs
he
found
the
trainer
awaiting
him
in
the
hall
wearing
a
very
serious
face
if
you
will
stroll
with
me
as
far
as
the
yard
i
should
like
to
show
you
something
he
said
carne
accordingly
took
up
his
hat
and
followed
him
out
you
look
unusually
serious
said
the
latter
as
they
crossed
the
garden
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
get
possession
of
your
horse
carne
stopped
short
in
his
walk
and
faced
the
other
what
did
i
tell
you
yesterday
he
remarked
i
was
certain
that
that
letter
was
more
than
an
idle
warning
but
how
do
you
know
that
an
attempt
has
been
made
come
sir
and
see
for
yourself
said
bent
i
am
sorry
to
say
there
is
no
gainsaying
the
fact
a
moment
later
they
had
reached
the
entrance
to
the
see
sir
said
bent
pointing
to
a
circular
hole
which
now
existed
where
previously
the
lock
had
been
the
rascals
cut
out
the
lock
and
thus
gained
an
entry
to
the
yard
he
picked
up
the
round
piece
of
wood
with
the
lock
still
attached
to
it
and
showed
it
to
his
employer
one
thing
is
very
certain
the
man
who
cut
this
hole
is
a
master
of
his
trade
and
is
also
the
possessor
of
fine
implements
so
it
would
appear
said
carne
grimly
now
what
else
is
there
for
me
to
hear
is
the
horse
much
hurt
not
a
bit
the
worse
sir
answered
bent
they
didn
t
get
in
at
him
you
see
something
must
have
frightened
them
before
they
could
complete
their
task
step
this
way
sir
if
you
please
and
examine
the
door
of
the
box
for
yourself
i
have
given
strict
orders
that
nothing
shall
be
touched
until
you
have
seen
it
they
crossed
the
yard
together
and
approached
the
box
in
question
on
the
woodwork
the
commencement
of
a
circle
similar
to
that
which
had
been
completed
on
the
yard
gates
could
be
plainly
distinguished
while
on
the
ground
below
lay
four
pads
one
of
which
carne
picked
up
what
on
earth
are
these
things
he
asked
innocently
their
use
is
easily
explained
sir
answered
the
trainer
they
are
intended
for
tying
over
the
horse
s
feet
so
that
when
he
is
led
out
of
his
box
his
plates
may
make
no
noise
upon
the
stones
i
d
like
to
have
been
behind
em
with
a
whip
when
they
got
him
out
that
s
all
the
rascals
to
try
such
a
trick
upon
a
horse
in
my
charge
i
can
understand
your
indignation
said
carne
it
seems
to
me
we
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
narrow
escape
or
no
narrow
escape
i
d
have
em
safely
locked
up
in
merford
police
station
by
this
time
replied
bent
vindictively
and
now
sir
let
me
show
you
how
they
got
out
as
far
as
i
can
see
they
must
have
imagined
they
heard
somebody
coming
from
the
house
otherwise
they
would
have
left
by
the
gates
instead
of
by
this
ladder
he
pointed
to
the
ladder
which
was
still
standing
where
carne
had
placed
it
and
then
led
him
by
a
side
door
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
here
he
pointed
to
some
heavy
footmarks
upon
the
turf
carne
examined
them
closely
if
the
size
of
his
boot
is
any
criterion
of
his
build
he
said
he
must
have
been
a
precious
big
fellow
let
me
see
how
mine
compares
with
it
he
placed
his
neat
shoe
in
one
of
the
imprints
before
him
and
smiled
as
he
noticed
how
the
other
overlapped
it
they
then
made
their
way
to
the
box
where
they
found
the
animal
at
his
breakfast
he
lifted
his
head
and
glanced
round
at
them
bit
at
the
iron
of
the
manger
and
then
gave
a
little
playful
kick
with
one
of
his
hind
legs
he
doesn
t
seem
any
the
worse
for
his
adventure
said
carne
as
the
trainer
went
up
to
him
and
ran
his
hand
over
his
legs
not
a
bit
answered
the
other
he
s
a
wonderfully
horse
and
it
takes
a
lot
to
put
him
out
if
his
nerves
had
been
at
all
upset
he
wouldn
t
have
licked
up
his
food
as
clean
as
he
has
done
having
given
another
look
at
him
they
left
him
in
charge
of
his
lad
and
returned
to
the
house
the
gallop
after
breakfast
confirmed
their
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
and
simon
carne
returned
to
town
ostensibly
comforted
by
bent
s
solemn
assurance
to
that
effect
that
afternoon
lord
calingforth
the
owner
of
vulcanite
called
upon
him
they
had
met
repeatedly
and
consequently
were
on
the
most
intimate
terms
carne
he
said
as
he
entered
the
room
i
have
come
to
condole
with
you
upon
your
misfortune
and
to
offer
you
my
warmest
sympathy
why
what
on
earth
has
happened
asked
carne
as
he
offered
his
visitor
a
cigar
god
bless
my
soul
my
dear
fellow
haven
t
you
seen
the
afternoon
paper
why
it
reports
the
startling
news
that
your
stables
were
broken
into
last
night
and
that
my
rival
knight
of
malta
was
missing
this
morning
carne
laughed
i
wonder
what
they
ll
say
next
he
said
quietly
but
don
t
let
me
appear
to
deceive
you
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
stables
were
broken
into
last
night
but
the
thieves
were
disturbed
and
decamped
just
as
they
were
forcing
the
lock
of
the
knight
s
box
in
that
case
i
congratulate
you
what
rascally
inventions
some
of
these
sporting
papers
do
get
hold
of
to
be
sure
i
m
indeed
glad
to
hear
that
it
is
not
true
the
race
would
have
lost
half
its
interest
if
your
horse
were
out
of
it
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
are
still
as
confident
as
ever
would
you
like
to
test
it
very
much
if
you
feel
inclined
for
a
bet
then
i
ll
have
a
level
thousand
pounds
with
you
that
my
horse
beats
yours
both
to
start
or
the
wager
is
off
do
you
agree
with
pleasure
i
ll
make
a
note
of
it
the
noble
earl
jotted
the
bet
down
in
his
book
and
then
changed
the
subject
by
inquiring
whether
carne
had
ever
had
any
transactions
with
his
neighbor
klimo
only
on
one
occasion
the
other
replied
i
consulted
him
on
behalf
of
the
duke
of
wiltshire
at
the
time
his
wife
s
diamonds
were
stolen
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
half
thinking
of
calling
him
in
to
see
if
he
could
find
the
fellow
who
broke
into
the
stables
last
night
but
on
second
thoughts
i
determined
not
to
do
so
i
did
not
want
to
make
any
more
fuss
about
it
than
i
could
help
but
what
makes
you
ask
about
klimo
well
to
put
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
small
pilfering
down
at
my
trainer
s
place
lately
and
i
want
to
get
it
stopped
if
i
were
you
i
should
wait
till
after
the
race
and
then
have
him
down
if
one
excites
public
curiosity
just
now
one
never
knows
what
will
happen
i
think
you
are
right
anyhow
i
ll
act
on
your
advice
now
what
do
you
say
to
coming
along
to
the
rooms
with
me
to
see
how
our
horses
stand
in
the
market
your
presence
there
would
do
more
than
any
number
of
paper
denials
towards
showing
the
fallacy
of
this
stupid
report
will
you
come
with
pleasure
said
carne
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
was
sitting
beside
the
noble
earl
in
his
mail
phaeton
driving
towards
the
rooms
in
question
when
he
got
there
he
found
lord
calingforth
had
stated
the
case
very
correctly
the
report
that
knight
of
malta
had
been
stolen
had
been
widely
circulated
and
carne
discovered
that
the
animal
was
for
the
moment
almost
a
dead
letter
in
the
market
the
presence
of
his
owner
however
was
sufficient
to
stay
the
panic
and
when
he
had
snapped
up
two
or
three
long
bets
which
a
few
moments
before
had
been
going
begging
the
horse
began
steadily
to
rise
towards
his
old
position
that
night
when
belton
waited
upon
his
master
at
bedtime
he
found
him
if
possible
more
silent
than
usual
it
was
not
until
his
work
was
completed
that
the
other
spoke
it
s
a
strange
thing
belton
he
said
and
you
may
hardly
believe
it
but
if
there
were
not
certain
reasons
to
prevent
me
from
being
so
magnanimous
i
would
give
this
matter
up
and
let
the
race
be
run
on
its
merits
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
took
a
scheme
in
hand
with
a
worse
grace
however
as
it
can
t
be
helped
i
suppose
i
must
go
through
with
it
is
the
van
prepared
it
is
quite
ready
sir
all
the
furniture
arranged
as
i
directed
it
is
exactly
as
you
wished
sir
i
have
attended
to
it
myself
and
what
about
the
man
i
have
engaged
the
young
fellow
sir
who
assisted
me
before
i
know
he
s
quick
and
i
can
stake
my
life
he
s
trustworthy
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
will
have
need
to
be
now
for
my
arrangements
i
shall
make
the
attempt
on
friday
morning
next
that
is
to
say
two
days
from
now
you
and
the
man
you
have
just
mentioned
will
take
the
van
and
horses
to
market
stopford
travelling
by
the
goods
train
which
i
have
discovered
reaches
the
town
between
four
and
five
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
you
are
out
of
the
station
you
will
start
straight
away
along
the
highroad
towards
exbridge
reaching
the
village
between
five
and
six
i
shall
meet
you
in
the
road
alongside
the
third
milestone
on
the
other
side
made
up
for
the
part
i
am
to
play
do
you
understand
perfectly
sir
that
will
do
then
i
shall
go
down
to
the
village
evening
and
you
will
not
hear
from
me
again
until
you
meet
me
at
the
place
i
have
named
sir
now
it
is
a
fact
that
if
you
wish
to
excite
the
anger
of
the
inhabitants
of
exbridge
village
and
more
particularly
of
any
member
of
the
pitman
training
establishment
you
have
but
to
ask
for
information
concerning
a
certain
blind
beggar
who
put
in
an
appearance
there
towards
sunset
on
the
thursday
preceding
the
derby
of
and
you
will
do
so
when
that
mysterious
individual
first
came
in
sight
he
was
creeping
along
the
dusty
high
road
that
winds
across
the
downs
from
market
stopford
to
beaton
junction
dolorously
quavering
a
ballad
that
was
intended
to
be
though
few
would
have
recognized
it
the
wearing
of
the
green
on
reaching
the
stables
he
tapped
along
the
wall
with
his
stick
until
he
came
to
the
gate
then
when
he
was
asked
his
business
by
the
head
lad
who
had
been
called
up
by
one
of
the
stable
boys
he
stated
that
he
was
starving
and
with
peculiar
arts
of
his
own
induced
them
to
provide
him
with
a
meal
for
upwards
of
an
hour
he
remained
talking
with
the
lads
and
then
wended
his
way
down
the
hill
towards
the
village
where
he
further
managed
to
induce
the
rector
to
permit
him
to
occupy
one
of
his
outhouses
for
the
night
after
tea
he
went
out
and
sat
on
the
green
but
towards
eight
o
clock
he
crossed
the
stream
at
the
ford
and
made
his
way
up
to
a
little
copse
which
ornamented
a
slight
eminence
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
village
to
that
upon
which
the
training
stables
were
situated
how
he
found
his
way
considering
his
infirmity
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
that
he
did
find
it
was
proved
by
his
presence
there
it
might
also
have
been
noticed
that
when
he
was
once
under
cover
of
the
bushes
he
gave
up
tapping
the
earth
with
his
stick
and
walked
straight
enough
and
without
apparent
hesitation
to
the
stump
of
a
tree
upon
which
he
seated
himself
for
some
time
he
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
the
evening
undisturbed
by
the
presence
of
any
other
human
being
then
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
next
moment
a
stable
lad
parted
the
bushes
and
came
into
view
hullo
said
the
so
you
managed
to
get
here
first
so
i
have
said
the
old
rascal
and
it
s
wonderful
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
considering
my
age
and
what
a
poor
old
blind
chap
i
be
but
i
m
glad
to
find
ye
ve
managed
to
get
away
my
lad
now
what
have
ye
got
to
say
for
yourself
i
don
t
know
that
i
ve
got
anything
to
say
replied
the
boy
but
this
much
is
certain
what
you
want
can
t
be
done
and
a
fine
young
cockerel
you
are
to
be
sure
to
crow
so
loud
that
it
can
t
be
done
said
the
old
fellow
with
an
evil
chuckle
how
do
you
know
it
can
t
because
i
don
t
see
my
way
replied
the
other
it
s
too
dangerous
by
a
long
sight
why
if
the
guv
nor
was
to
get
wind
of
what
you
want
me
to
do
england
itself
wouldn
t
be
big
enough
to
hold
us
both
you
don
t
know
im
as
well
as
i
do
i
know
him
well
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
replied
the
beggar
now
if
you
ve
got
any
more
objections
to
raise
be
quick
about
it
if
you
haven
t
then
i
ll
talk
to
you
you
haven
t
very
good
then
now
just
hold
your
jaw
open
your
ears
and
listen
to
what
i
ve
got
to
say
what
time
do
you
go
to
exercise
morning
nine
o
clock
very
good
then
you
go
down
on
to
the
downs
and
the
boss
sends
you
off
with
vulcanite
for
a
canter
what
do
you
do
why
you
go
steadily
enough
as
long
as
he
can
see
you
but
directly
you
re
round
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
you
stick
in
your
heels
and
nip
into
the
wood
that
runs
along
on
your
right
hand
just
as
if
your
horse
was
bolting
with
you
once
in
there
you
go
through
for
a
until
you
come
to
the
stream
ford
that
and
then
cut
into
the
next
wood
riding
as
if
the
devil
himself
were
after
you
until
you
reach
the
path
above
hangman
s
hollow
do
you
know
the
place
i
reckon
i
ought
to
well
then
you
just
make
tracks
for
it
when
you
get
there
you
ll
find
me
waiting
for
you
after
that
i
ll
take
over
command
and
get
both
you
and
the
horse
out
of
england
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
will
ever
suspect
then
there
ll
be
five
hundred
pounds
for
your
trouble
a
safe
passage
with
the
horse
to
south
america
and
another
five
hundred
the
day
the
nag
is
set
ashore
there
s
not
as
much
risk
as
you
could
take
between
your
finger
and
thumb
and
a
lad
with
a
spirit
like
yours
could
make
a
fortune
with
a
thousand
pounds
on
the
other
side
what
have
you
to
say
now
it
s
all
very
well
replied
the
lad
but
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
ll
play
straight
with
me
what
do
you
take
me
for
said
the
beggar
indignantly
at
the
same
time
putting
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
and
producing
what
looked
like
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
if
you
doubt
me
there
s
something
that
may
help
to
convince
you
but
don
t
go
showing
it
around
or
you
ll
be
giving
yourself
away
and
that
ll
mean
the
stone
jug
for
you
and
amen
to
all
your
hopes
of
a
fortune
you
ll
do
as
i
wish
now
i
suppose
i
ll
do
it
said
the
lad
sullenly
as
he
crumpled
the
banknote
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
but
now
i
must
be
off
since
there
s
been
this
fuss
about
knight
of
malta
the
guv
nor
has
us
all
in
before
eight
o
clock
and
keeps
the
horse
under
lock
and
key
with
the
head
lad
sleeping
in
the
box
with
him
well
to
you
and
don
t
you
forget
about
morning
niggle
the
horse
about
a
bit
just
to
make
him
impatient
like
and
drop
a
hint
that
he
s
a
bit
fresh
that
will
make
his
bolting
look
more
feasible
don
t
leave
the
track
while
there
s
any
one
near
you
but
as
soon
as
you
do
ride
like
thunder
to
the
place
i
told
you
of
i
ll
see
that
they
re
put
off
the
scent
as
to
the
way
you
ve
gone
all
right
said
the
lad
i
don
t
like
it
but
i
suppose
i
m
in
too
deep
now
to
draw
back
and
good
luck
to
you
once
he
had
got
rid
of
the
youth
carne
for
it
was
he
returned
by
another
route
to
the
rector
s
outbuilding
where
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
straw
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
his
slumbers
lasted
till
nearly
daybreak
when
he
rose
and
made
his
way
across
country
to
the
small
copse
above
hangman
s
hollow
on
the
road
from
exbridge
to
beaton
junction
here
he
discovered
a
large
van
drawn
up
apparently
laden
with
furniture
both
inside
and
out
the
horses
were
feeding
beneath
a
tree
and
a
couple
of
men
were
eating
their
breakfast
beside
them
on
seeing
carne
the
taller
of
the
pair
a
workman
with
a
big
brown
beard
rose
and
touched
his
hat
the
other
looked
with
astonishment
at
the
disreputable
beggar
standing
before
them
so
you
arrived
here
safely
said
carne
if
anything
you
re
a
little
before
your
time
boil
a
cup
of
tea
and
give
me
something
to
eat
as
quickly
as
possible
for
i
am
nearly
famished
when
you
have
done
that
get
out
the
clothes
i
told
you
to
bring
with
you
and
let
me
change
into
them
it
wouldn
t
do
for
any
of
the
people
from
the
village
back
yonder
to
be
able
to
say
afterwards
that
they
saw
me
talking
with
you
in
this
as
soon
as
his
hunger
was
appeased
he
disappeared
into
the
wood
and
dressed
himself
in
his
new
attire
another
suit
of
clothes
and
an
apron
such
as
might
be
worn
by
a
furniture
remover
s
foreman
a
grey
wig
a
short
grey
beard
and
moustache
and
a
bowler
hat
changed
his
identity
completely
indeed
when
his
rags
had
been
hidden
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
matter
to
have
traced
any
resemblance
between
the
workman
eating
his
breakfast
and
the
disreputable
beggar
of
before
it
was
close
upon
nine
o
clock
by
this
time
and
as
soon
as
he
realized
this
carne
gave
the
order
to
put
the
horses
to
this
done
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
back
of
the
van
and
then
a
strange
thing
became
apparent
though
to
all
appearances
viewed
from
the
open
doors
at
the
end
the
inside
of
this
giant
receptacle
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
with
chests
of
drawers
chairs
bedsteads
carpets
and
other
articles
of
household
furniture
yet
by
pulling
a
pair
of
handles
it
was
possible
for
two
men
easily
to
withdraw
what
looked
like
half
the
contents
of
the
van
the
poorest
observer
would
then
have
noticed
that
in
almost
every
particular
these
articles
were
dummies
affixed
to
a
screen
capable
of
being
removed
at
a
moment
s
notice
the
remainder
of
the
van
was
fitted
after
the
fashion
of
a
stable
with
a
manger
at
the
end
and
a
pair
of
slings
dependent
from
the
roof
the
nervous
tension
produced
by
the
waiting
soon
became
almost
more
than
the
men
could
bear
minute
after
minute
went
slowly
by
and
still
the
eagerly
expected
horse
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
then
belton
whom
carne
had
placed
on
the
lookout
came
flying
towards
them
with
the
report
that
he
could
hear
a
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
in
the
wood
a
few
seconds
later
the
noise
could
be
plainly
heard
at
the
van
and
almost
before
they
had
time
to
comment
upon
it
a
magnificent
thoroughbred
ridden
by
the
stable
boy
who
had
talked
to
the
blind
beggar
on
the
previous
evening
dashed
into
view
and
pulled
up
beside
the
van
jump
off
cried
carne
catching
at
the
horse
s
head
and
remove
the
saddle
now
be
quick
with
those
cloths
we
must
rub
him
down
or
he
ll
catch
cold
when
the
horse
was
comparatively
dry
he
was
led
into
the
van
which
was
to
be
his
stable
for
the
next
few
hours
and
in
spite
of
his
protests
slung
in
such
a
fashion
that
his
feet
did
not
touch
the
floor
this
business
completed
carne
bade
the
frightened
boy
get
in
with
him
and
take
care
that
he
did
not
on
any
account
neigh
after
that
the
mask
of
furniture
was
replaced
and
the
doors
closed
and
locked
the
men
mounted
to
their
places
on
the
box
and
roof
and
the
van
continued
its
journey
along
the
highway
towards
the
junction
but
satisfactory
as
their
attempt
had
so
far
proved
the
danger
was
by
no
means
over
scarcely
had
they
proceeded
three
miles
on
their
way
before
carne
distinguished
the
sound
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
behind
him
a
moment
later
a
young
man
mounted
on
a
horse
came
into
view
rode
up
alongside
and
signalled
to
the
driver
to
stop
what
s
the
matter
inquired
the
latter
as
he
brought
his
horses
to
a
standstill
have
we
dropped
anything
have
you
seen
anything
of
a
boy
on
a
horse
asked
the
man
who
was
so
much
out
of
breath
that
he
could
scarcely
get
his
words
out
what
sort
of
a
boy
and
what
sort
of
a
horse
asked
the
man
on
the
van
a
youngish
boy
was
the
reply
seven
stone
weight
with
sandy
hair
on
a
thoroughbred
no
we
ain
t
seen
no
boy
with
sandy
air
ridin
of
a
thoroughbred
orse
seven
stone
weight
said
carne
what
s
e
been
an
done
the
horse
has
bolted
with
him
off
the
downs
back
yonder
answered
the
man
the
guv
nor
has
sent
us
out
in
all
directions
to
look
for
him
sorry
we
can
t
oblige
you
said
the
driver
as
he
prepared
to
start
his
team
again
to
you
much
obliged
said
the
horseman
and
when
he
had
turned
off
into
a
side
road
the
van
continued
its
journey
till
it
reached
the
railway
station
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
it
caught
the
eleven
o
clock
goods
train
and
set
off
for
the
small
seaside
town
of
barworth
on
the
south
coast
where
it
was
shipped
on
board
a
steamer
which
had
arrived
that
morning
from
london
once
it
was
safely
transferred
from
the
railway
truck
to
the
deck
carne
was
accosted
by
a
tall
swarthy
individual
who
from
his
importance
seemed
to
be
both
the
owner
and
the
skipper
of
the
vessel
they
went
down
into
the
saloon
together
and
a
few
moments
later
an
observer
had
one
been
there
might
have
seen
a
cheque
for
a
considerable
sum
of
money
change
hands
an
hour
later
the
was
steaming
out
to
sea
and
a
individual
not
at
all
to
be
compared
with
the
industrious
mechanic
who
had
shipped
the
furniture
van
on
board
the
vessel
bound
for
spain
stood
on
the
platform
of
the
station
waiting
for
the
express
train
to
london
on
reaching
the
metropolis
he
discovered
it
surging
beneath
the
weight
of
a
great
excitement
the
streets
with
the
raucous
cries
of
the
newsvenders
the
derby
favorite
stolen
vulcanite
missing
from
his
stable
next
morning
an
advertisement
appeared
in
every
paper
of
consequence
offering
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pounds
for
any
information
that
might
lead
to
the
conviction
of
the
person
or
persons
who
on
the
morning
of
may
had
stolen
or
caused
to
be
stolen
from
the
pitman
training
stables
the
derby
favorite
vulcanite
the
property
of
the
right
honorable
the
earl
of
calingforth
the
week
following
knight
of
malta
owned
by
simon
carne
of
dorchester
house
park
lane
won
the
derby
by
a
neck
in
a
scene
of
intense
excitement
the
mandarin
being
second
and
the
filibuster
third
it
is
a
strange
fact
that
to
this
day
not
a
member
of
the
racing
world
has
been
able
to
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
the
disappearance
of
one
of
the
greatest
horses
that
ever
set
foot
on
an
english
if
simon
carne
thinks
of
that
momentous
occasion
when
amid
the
shouting
crowd
of
epsom
he
led
his
horse
back
a
winner
he
smiles
softly
to
himself
and
murmurs
beneath
his
breath
valued
at
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
beaten
in
the
derby
by
a
furniture
van
service
to
the
state
it
was
the
day
following
that
upon
which
simon
carne
presented
by
the
earl
of
amberley
had
made
his
bow
before
the
heir
apparent
at
the
second
levee
of
the
season
that
klimo
entered
upon
one
of
the
most
interesting
cases
which
had
so
far
come
into
his
experience
the
clock
in
his
had
just
struck
one
when
his
elderly
housekeeper
entered
and
handed
him
a
card
bearing
the
name
of
george
jeffreys
bellamer
street
bloomsbury
the
detective
immediately
bade
his
servant
admit
the
visitor
and
almost
before
he
had
given
the
order
the
lady
in
question
stood
before
him
she
was
young
not
more
than
at
most
a
frail
wisp
of
a
girl
with
light
brown
hair
and
eyes
that
spoke
for
her
nationality
as
plain
as
any
words
she
was
neatly
but
by
no
means
expensively
dressed
and
showed
evident
signs
of
being
oppressed
by
a
weight
of
trouble
klimo
looked
at
her
and
in
that
glance
took
in
everything
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
reputed
to
possess
a
heart
as
hard
as
any
flint
it
was
noticeable
that
his
voice
when
he
spoke
to
her
was
not
as
gruff
as
that
in
which
he
usually
addressed
his
visitors
pray
sit
down
he
said
and
tell
me
in
as
few
words
as
possible
what
it
is
you
desire
that
i
should
do
for
you
speak
as
clearly
as
you
can
and
it
you
want
my
help
don
t
hesitate
to
tell
me
everything
the
girl
sat
down
as
ordered
and
immediately
commenced
her
tale
my
name
is
eileen
jeffreys
she
said
i
am
the
wife
of
an
english
bank
inspector
and
the
daughter
of
septimus
o
grady
of
chicago
i
shall
remember
replied
klimo
and
how
long
have
you
been
married
two
years
answered
the
girl
two
years
next
september
my
husband
and
i
met
in
america
and
then
came
to
england
to
settle
in
saying
to
your
old
home
you
left
your
father
behind
i
presume
yes
he
preferred
to
remain
in
america
may
i
ask
his
profession
that
i
m
afraid
foolish
as
it
may
seem
to
say
so
i
can
not
tell
you
answered
the
girl
with
a
slightly
heightened
color
his
means
of
earning
a
living
were
always
kept
a
secret
from
me
that
was
rather
strange
was
it
not
said
klimo
had
he
private
resources
none
that
i
ever
heard
of
replied
the
girl
did
no
business
men
ever
come
to
see
him
but
very
few
people
came
to
us
at
all
we
had
scarcely
any
friends
of
what
nationality
were
the
friends
who
did
come
mostly
irish
like
ourselves
answered
jeffreys
was
there
ever
any
quarrel
between
your
father
and
your
husband
prior
to
your
leaving
america
never
any
downright
quarrel
said
the
girl
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
were
not
always
the
best
of
friends
in
those
days
my
father
was
a
very
difficult
man
to
get
on
with
indeed
said
klimo
now
perhaps
you
had
better
proceed
with
your
story
to
do
that
i
must
explain
that
at
the
end
of
january
of
this
present
year
my
father
who
was
then
in
chicago
sent
us
a
cablegram
to
say
he
was
leaving
for
england
that
very
day
and
that
upon
his
arrival
in
england
if
we
had
no
objection
he
would
like
to
take
up
his
residence
with
us
he
was
to
sail
from
new
york
on
the
saturday
following
and
as
you
know
the
passage
takes
six
days
or
thereabouts
arriving
in
england
he
came
to
london
and
put
up
at
our
house
in
bellamer
street
bloomsbury
that
was
during
the
first
week
in
february
last
and
off
and
on
he
has
been
living
with
us
ever
since
have
you
any
idea
what
brought
him
to
england
not
the
least
she
answered
deliberately
after
a
few
seconds
pause
which
klimo
did
not
fail
to
notice
did
he
do
business
with
any
one
that
you
are
aware
of
i
can
not
say
on
several
occasions
he
went
away
for
a
week
at
a
time
into
the
midlands
but
what
took
him
there
i
have
no
possible
idea
on
the
last
occasion
he
left
us
on
the
fifteenth
of
last
month
and
returned
on
the
ninth
of
this
the
same
day
that
my
husband
was
called
away
to
marseilles
on
important
banking
business
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
not
well
he
was
feverish
and
within
a
short
time
of
my
getting
him
to
bed
he
began
to
wander
in
his
mind
declaring
over
and
over
again
that
he
bitterly
repented
some
action
he
had
taken
and
that
if
he
could
once
consider
himself
safe
again
would
be
quit
of
the
whole
thing
forever
for
close
upon
a
fortnight
i
continued
to
nurse
him
until
he
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
recognize
me
once
more
the
day
that
he
did
so
i
took
in
at
the
door
this
cablegram
from
which
i
may
perhaps
date
the
business
that
has
brought
me
to
you
she
took
a
paper
from
her
pocket
and
handed
it
to
klimo
who
glanced
at
it
examined
the
and
the
date
and
then
placed
it
upon
the
desk
before
him
it
was
from
chicago
and
ran
as
follows
o
grady
bellamer
street
london
england
why
no
answer
reply
chances
of
doing
business
nero
of
course
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
this
meant
i
was
not
in
my
father
s
confidence
and
i
had
no
notion
who
his
mysterious
correspondent
might
be
but
as
the
doctor
had
distinctly
stated
that
to
allow
him
to
consider
any
business
at
all
would
bring
on
a
relapse
and
probably
kill
him
i
placed
the
message
in
a
drawer
and
determined
to
let
it
remain
there
until
he
should
be
well
enough
to
attend
to
it
without
danger
to
himself
the
week
following
he
was
not
quite
so
well
and
fortunately
there
was
complete
silence
on
the
part
of
his
correspondents
then
this
second
message
arrived
as
you
will
see
it
is
also
from
chicago
and
from
the
same
person
reply
immediately
or
remember
consequences
time
presses
if
do
not
realize
at
present
price
market
will
be
lost
nero
following
my
previous
line
of
action
i
placed
this
communication
also
in
the
drawer
and
determined
to
let
nero
wait
for
a
reply
by
doing
so
however
i
was
incurring
greater
trouble
than
i
dreamt
of
within
hours
i
received
the
following
message
and
upon
that
i
made
up
my
mind
and
came
off
at
once
to
you
what
it
means
i
do
not
know
but
that
it
bodes
some
ill
to
my
father
i
feel
certain
i
had
heard
of
your
fame
and
as
my
husband
is
away
from
home
my
father
unable
to
protect
himself
and
i
am
without
friends
at
all
in
england
i
thought
the
wisest
course
i
could
pursue
would
be
to
consult
you
let
me
look
at
the
last
cablegram
said
klimo
putting
his
hand
from
the
box
and
taking
the
slip
of
paper
the
first
and
second
message
were
simplicity
itself
this
however
was
a
complete
enigma
it
was
worded
as
follows
uneasy
alpha
omega
nineteen
twelve
today
five
lacs
arrange
seventy
eight
brazils
one
twenty
nine
nero
klimo
read
it
through
and
the
girl
noticed
that
he
shook
his
head
over
it
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
am
afraid
that
it
would
be
safer
for
you
not
to
tell
me
any
further
for
i
fear
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
help
you
you
will
not
help
me
now
that
i
have
told
you
my
miserable
position
then
there
is
nothing
before
me
but
despair
oh
sir
is
your
decision
quite
irrevocable
you
can
not
think
how
i
have
counted
on
your
assistance
i
regret
exceedingly
that
i
am
compelled
to
disappoint
you
he
answered
but
my
time
is
more
than
occupied
as
it
is
and
i
could
not
give
your
case
my
attention
even
if
i
would
his
decision
had
been
too
much
for
her
fortitude
and
before
he
could
prevent
it
her
head
was
down
upon
her
hands
and
she
had
begun
to
weep
bitterly
he
attempted
to
comfort
her
but
in
vain
and
when
she
left
him
tears
were
still
coursing
down
her
cheeks
it
was
not
until
she
had
been
gone
about
ten
minutes
and
he
had
informed
his
housekeeper
that
he
would
see
no
more
clients
that
day
that
he
discovered
that
she
had
left
her
precious
cablegrams
behind
her
actuated
by
a
feeling
of
curiosity
he
sat
down
again
and
spread
the
three
cablegrams
out
upon
his
the
first
two
as
i
have
said
required
no
consideration
they
spoke
for
themselves
but
the
third
baffled
him
completely
who
was
this
septimus
o
grady
who
lived
in
chicago
and
whose
associates
spent
their
time
discussing
the
wrongs
of
ireland
how
was
it
that
being
a
man
innocent
of
private
means
he
engaged
in
no
business
then
another
question
called
for
consideration
if
he
had
no
business
what
brought
him
to
london
and
took
him
so
repeatedly
into
the
midlands
these
riddles
he
set
aside
for
the
present
and
began
to
pick
the
last
cablegram
to
pieces
that
its
author
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
when
he
wrote
it
was
quite
certain
then
who
and
what
were
the
alpha
and
omega
mentioned
what
connection
had
they
with
nero
also
what
did
nineteen
and
twelve
mean
when
coupled
with
further
why
should
five
lacs
arrange
brazils
and
what
possible
sense
could
be
made
out
of
the
numbers
one
twenty
and
nine
he
read
the
message
from
beginning
to
end
again
after
that
from
the
end
to
the
beginning
and
like
a
good
many
other
men
in
a
similar
position
because
he
could
not
understand
it
found
himself
taking
a
greater
interest
in
it
this
feeling
had
not
left
him
when
he
had
put
off
disguise
as
klimo
and
was
simon
carne
once
more
while
he
was
eating
his
lunch
the
thought
of
the
lonely
irishman
lying
ill
in
a
house
where
he
was
without
doubt
an
unwelcome
guest
fascinated
him
strangely
and
when
he
rose
from
the
table
he
found
he
was
not
able
to
shake
off
the
impression
it
had
given
him
that
the
girl
had
some
notion
of
her
father
s
business
he
felt
as
certain
as
of
his
own
name
even
though
she
had
so
strenuously
denied
the
fact
otherwise
why
should
she
have
been
so
frightened
by
what
might
have
been
simply
innocent
business
messages
in
cypher
that
she
was
frightened
was
as
plain
as
the
sun
then
shining
into
his
room
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
resolved
not
to
take
up
the
case
he
went
into
his
study
and
took
the
cablegrams
from
the
drawer
in
which
he
had
placed
them
then
drawing
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
him
he
set
to
work
upon
the
puzzle
the
first
word
requires
no
explanation
he
said
as
he
wrote
it
down
for
the
two
next
alpha
and
omega
we
will
for
the
sake
of
argument
write
the
beginning
and
the
end
and
as
that
tells
us
nothing
we
will
substitute
for
them
the
first
and
the
last
now
who
or
what
are
the
first
and
the
last
are
they
the
first
and
last
words
of
a
code
or
of
a
word
or
do
they
refer
to
two
individuals
who
are
the
principal
folk
in
some
company
or
conspiracy
if
the
latter
it
is
just
possible
they
are
the
people
who
are
so
desperately
uneasy
the
next
two
words
however
are
too
much
for
me
altogether
uninteresting
as
the
case
appeared
at
first
sight
he
soon
discovered
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
he
found
himself
puzzling
over
it
during
an
afternoon
concert
at
the
queen
s
hall
and
he
even
thought
of
it
while
calling
upon
the
wife
of
the
prime
minister
afterwards
as
he
drove
in
the
park
before
dinner
the
wheels
of
his
carriage
seemed
to
be
saying
alpha
and
omega
nineteen
twelve
over
and
over
again
with
pitiless
reiteration
and
by
the
time
he
reached
home
once
more
he
would
gladly
have
paid
a
note
for
a
feasible
solution
of
the
enigma
if
only
to
get
its
weight
off
his
mind
while
waiting
for
dinner
he
took
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
the
message
out
again
this
time
in
different
ways
but
the
effect
was
the
same
none
of
them
afforded
him
any
clue
he
then
took
the
second
letter
of
each
word
after
that
the
third
then
the
fourth
and
so
on
until
he
had
exhausted
them
the
result
in
each
case
was
absolute
gibberish
and
he
felt
that
he
was
no
nearer
understanding
it
than
when
jeffrey
s
had
handed
it
to
him
nearly
eight
hours
before
during
the
night
he
dreamt
about
it
and
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
its
weight
was
still
upon
his
mind
nineteen
twelve
it
is
true
had
left
him
but
he
was
not
better
off
for
the
reason
that
seventy
eight
brazils
had
taken
its
place
when
he
got
out
of
bed
he
tried
it
again
but
at
the
end
of
his
patience
was
exhausted
confound
the
thing
he
said
as
he
threw
the
paper
from
him
and
seated
himself
in
a
chair
before
his
in
order
that
his
confidential
valet
belton
might
shave
him
i
ll
think
no
more
of
it
jeffreys
must
solve
the
mystery
for
herself
it
has
worried
me
too
much
already
he
laid
his
head
back
upon
the
rest
and
allowed
his
valet
to
run
the
soap
brush
over
his
chin
but
however
much
he
might
desire
it
his
old
man
of
the
sea
was
not
to
be
discarded
so
easily
the
word
brazils
seemed
to
be
painted
in
letters
of
fire
upon
the
ceiling
as
the
razor
glided
over
his
cheek
he
thought
of
the
various
constructions
to
be
placed
upon
the
word
the
country
stocks
and
even
nuts
brazil
nuts
spanish
nuts
barcelona
nuts
walnuts
cob
nuts
and
then
as
if
to
make
the
nightmare
more
complete
no
less
a
thing
than
nutall
s
dictionary
the
smile
the
last
suggestion
caused
him
came
within
an
ace
of
leaving
its
mark
upon
his
cheek
he
signed
to
the
man
to
stay
his
hand
egad
he
cried
who
knows
but
this
may
be
the
solution
of
the
mystery
go
down
to
the
study
belton
and
bring
me
nuttall
s
dictionary
he
waited
with
one
side
of
his
face
still
soaped
until
his
value
returned
bringing
with
him
the
desired
volume
having
received
it
he
placed
it
upon
the
table
and
took
up
the
telegram
seventy
eight
brazils
it
said
one
twenty
nine
accordingly
he
chose
the
seventieth
page
and
ran
his
fingers
down
the
first
column
the
letter
was
b
but
the
eighth
word
proved
useless
he
thereupon
turned
to
the
page
and
in
the
first
column
discovered
the
word
in
a
second
the
whole
aspect
of
the
case
changed
and
he
became
all
eagerness
and
excitement
the
last
words
on
the
telegram
were
yet
it
was
plain
that
there
were
barely
a
hundred
upon
the
page
the
only
explanation
therefore
was
that
the
word
one
distinguished
the
column
and
the
referred
to
the
number
of
the
word
in
it
almost
trembling
with
eagerness
he
began
to
count
surely
enough
the
word
was
bomb
the
coincidence
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
extraordinary
but
presuming
that
it
was
correct
the
rest
of
the
message
was
simplicity
itself
he
turned
the
telegram
over
and
upon
the
back
transcribed
the
communication
as
he
imagined
it
should
be
read
when
he
had
finished
it
ran
as
follows
owing
to
o
grady
s
silence
the
society
in
chicago
is
growing
uneasy
two
men
who
are
the
first
and
last
or
in
other
words
the
principal
members
are
going
to
do
something
with
fifty
thousand
somethings
so
arrange
about
the
bombs
having
got
so
far
all
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
find
out
to
what
referred
he
turned
to
the
dictionary
again
and
looked
for
the
twelfth
word
upon
the
nineteenth
page
this
proved
to
be
alkahest
which
told
him
nothing
so
he
reversed
the
proceedings
and
looked
for
the
nineteenth
word
upon
the
twelfth
page
but
this
proved
even
less
satisfactory
than
before
however
much
the
dictionary
might
have
helped
him
hitherto
it
was
plainly
useless
now
he
thought
and
thought
but
without
success
he
turned
up
the
almanac
but
the
dates
did
not
fit
in
he
then
wrote
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
and
against
each
placed
its
equivalent
number
the
nineteenth
letter
was
s
the
twelfth
did
they
represent
two
words
or
were
they
the
first
and
the
last
letters
of
a
word
in
that
case
what
could
it
be
the
only
three
he
could
think
of
were
and
the
two
first
were
hopeless
but
the
last
seemed
better
but
how
would
that
fit
in
he
took
up
his
pen
and
tried
it
owing
to
o
grady
s
silence
the
society
in
chicago
is
growing
uneasy
two
men
who
are
the
first
and
last
or
in
other
words
the
principal
members
sail
with
fifty
thousand
somethings
probably
pounds
or
dollars
so
prepare
bombs
nero
he
felt
convinced
that
he
had
hit
it
at
last
either
it
was
a
very
extraordinary
coincidence
or
he
had
discovered
the
answer
to
the
riddle
if
this
solution
were
correct
one
thing
was
certain
he
had
got
in
his
hands
quite
by
chance
a
clue
to
one
of
the
biggest
fenian
conspiracies
ever
yet
brought
to
light
he
remembered
that
at
that
moment
london
contained
half
the
crowned
heads
or
their
representatives
of
europe
what
better
occasion
could
the
enemies
of
law
and
order
desire
for
striking
a
blow
at
the
government
and
society
in
general
what
was
he
to
do
to
communicate
with
the
police
and
thus
allow
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
affair
would
be
an
act
of
the
maddest
folly
should
he
therefore
drop
the
whole
thing
as
he
had
at
first
proposed
or
should
he
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
help
jeffreys
in
her
trouble
by
shipping
her
father
out
of
harm
s
way
outwit
the
fenians
and
appropriate
the
fifty
thousand
pounds
mentioned
in
the
cablegram
himself
the
last
idea
was
distinctly
a
good
one
but
before
it
could
be
done
he
felt
he
must
be
certain
of
his
facts
was
the
fifty
thousand
referred
to
money
or
was
it
something
else
if
the
former
was
it
pounds
or
was
it
dollars
there
was
a
vast
difference
but
in
either
case
if
only
he
could
hit
on
a
safe
scheme
he
would
be
well
repaid
for
whatever
risk
he
might
run
he
decided
to
see
jeffreys
without
loss
of
time
accordingly
after
breakfast
he
sent
her
a
note
asking
her
to
call
upon
him
without
fail
at
twelve
o
clock
punctuality
is
not
generally
considered
a
virtue
possessed
by
the
sex
of
which
jeffreys
was
so
unfortunate
a
member
but
the
clock
upon
klimo
s
mantelpiece
had
scarcely
struck
the
hour
before
she
put
in
an
appearance
he
immediately
bade
her
be
seated
jeffreys
he
began
with
a
severely
judicial
air
it
is
with
much
regret
i
find
that
while
seeking
my
advice
yesterday
you
were
all
the
time
deceiving
me
how
was
it
that
you
failed
to
tell
me
that
your
father
was
connected
with
a
fenian
society
whose
one
aim
and
object
is
to
destroy
law
and
order
in
this
country
the
question
evidently
took
the
girl
by
surprise
she
became
deathly
pale
and
for
a
moment
klimo
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
with
a
marvelous
exhibition
of
will
however
she
pulled
herself
together
and
faced
her
accuser
you
have
no
right
to
say
such
a
thing
she
began
my
father
is
pardon
me
he
answered
quietly
but
i
am
in
the
possession
of
information
which
enables
me
to
understand
exactly
he
is
if
you
answer
me
correctly
it
is
probable
that
after
all
i
will
take
your
case
up
and
will
help
you
to
save
your
father
s
life
but
if
you
decline
to
do
so
ill
as
he
is
he
will
be
arrested
within
hours
and
then
nothing
on
earth
can
save
him
from
condign
punishment
which
do
you
prefer
i
will
tell
you
everything
she
said
quickly
i
ought
to
have
done
so
at
first
but
you
can
understand
why
i
shrank
from
it
my
father
has
for
a
long
time
past
been
ashamed
of
the
part
he
has
been
playing
but
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
too
valuable
to
them
and
they
would
not
let
him
slip
they
drove
him
on
and
on
and
it
was
his
remorse
and
anxiety
that
broke
him
down
at
last
i
think
you
have
chosen
the
better
course
in
telling
me
this
i
will
ask
my
questions
and
you
can
answer
them
to
begin
with
where
are
the
headquarters
of
the
society
in
chicago
i
thought
as
much
and
is
it
possible
for
you
to
tell
me
the
names
of
the
two
principal
members
there
are
many
members
and
i
don
t
know
that
one
is
greater
than
another
but
there
must
be
some
who
are
more
important
than
others
for
instance
the
pair
referred
to
in
this
telegram
as
alpha
and
omega
i
can
only
think
she
answered
after
a
moment
s
thought
that
they
must
be
the
two
men
who
came
oftenest
to
our
house
maguire
and
rooney
can
you
describe
them
or
better
still
have
you
their
photographs
i
have
a
photograph
of
rooney
it
was
taken
last
year
you
must
send
it
to
me
as
soon
as
you
get
home
he
said
and
now
give
me
as
close
a
description
as
possible
of
the
other
person
to
whom
you
refer
mr
maguire
jeffreys
considered
for
a
few
moments
before
she
answered
he
is
tall
standing
fully
six
feet
i
should
think
she
said
at
last
with
red
hair
and
watery
blue
eyes
in
the
left
of
which
there
is
a
slight
cast
he
is
and
in
spite
of
his
long
residence
in
america
speaks
with
a
decided
brogue
i
know
them
for
desperate
men
and
if
they
come
over
to
england
may
god
help
us
all
klimo
you
don
t
think
the
police
will
take
my
father
not
if
you
implicitly
obey
my
instructions
he
answered
klimo
thought
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
continued
if
you
wish
me
to
undertake
this
business
which
i
need
hardly
tell
you
is
out
of
my
usual
line
you
will
now
go
home
and
send
me
the
photograph
you
spoke
of
a
few
moments
since
after
that
you
will
take
no
sort
of
action
until
you
hear
from
me
again
for
certain
reasons
of
my
own
i
shall
take
this
matter
up
and
will
do
my
utmost
to
save
your
father
one
word
of
advice
first
say
nothing
to
anybody
but
pack
your
father
s
boxes
and
be
prepared
to
get
him
out
of
england
if
necessary
at
a
moment
s
notice
the
girl
rose
and
made
as
if
she
would
leave
the
room
but
instead
of
doing
so
she
stood
irresolute
for
a
few
moments
she
said
nothing
but
fumbled
with
the
handle
of
her
parasol
and
breathed
heavily
then
the
pluck
which
had
so
far
sustained
her
gave
way
entirely
and
she
fell
back
on
her
chair
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
klimo
instantly
left
his
box
and
went
round
to
her
he
made
a
figure
queer
enough
to
please
any
one
in
his
clothes
his
his
long
grey
hair
reaching
almost
to
his
shoulders
and
with
his
smoked
glass
spectacles
perched
upon
his
nose
why
cry
my
dear
young
lady
said
klimo
have
i
not
promised
to
do
my
best
for
you
let
us
however
understand
each
other
thoroughly
if
there
is
anything
you
are
keeping
back
you
must
tell
me
by
not
speaking
out
you
are
imperilling
your
own
and
your
father
s
safety
i
know
that
you
must
think
that
i
am
endeavoring
to
deceive
you
she
said
but
i
am
so
terribly
afraid
of
committing
myself
that
i
hardly
know
what
to
tell
and
what
not
to
tell
i
have
come
to
you
having
no
friends
in
the
whole
world
save
my
husband
who
is
in
marseilles
and
my
father
who
as
i
have
said
is
lying
dangerously
ill
in
our
house
of
course
i
know
what
my
father
has
been
surely
you
can
not
suppose
that
a
girl
like
myself
could
be
so
dense
as
not
to
guess
why
few
save
irishmen
visited
our
house
and
why
at
times
there
were
men
staying
with
us
for
weeks
at
a
time
who
lived
in
the
back
rooms
and
never
went
outside
our
front
door
and
who
when
they
did
take
their
departure
sneaked
out
in
the
dead
of
night
i
remember
a
time
in
the
fall
of
the
last
year
that
i
was
at
home
when
there
were
more
meetings
than
ever
and
when
these
men
maguire
and
rooney
almost
lived
with
us
they
and
my
father
were
occupied
day
and
night
in
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
then
in
the
january
following
maguire
came
to
england
three
weeks
later
the
papers
were
full
of
a
terrible
dynamite
explosion
in
london
in
which
forty
innocent
people
lost
their
lives
klimo
you
must
imagine
for
yourself
the
terror
and
shame
that
seized
me
particularly
when
i
remembered
that
my
father
was
a
companion
of
the
men
who
had
been
concerned
in
it
now
my
father
repents
and
they
are
edging
him
on
to
some
fresh
outrage
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
is
but
i
know
this
that
if
maguire
and
rooney
are
coming
to
england
something
awful
is
about
to
happen
and
if
they
distrust
him
and
there
is
any
chance
of
any
one
getting
into
trouble
my
father
will
be
made
the
scapegoat
to
run
away
from
them
would
be
to
court
certain
death
they
have
agents
in
almost
every
european
city
and
unless
we
could
get
right
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
they
would
be
certain
to
catch
us
besides
my
father
is
too
ill
to
travel
the
doctors
say
he
must
not
be
disturbed
under
any
pretence
whatever
well
well
said
klimo
leave
the
matter
to
me
and
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
send
me
the
photograph
you
spoke
of
and
let
me
know
instantly
if
there
are
any
further
developments
do
you
mean
that
after
all
i
can
rely
upon
you
helping
me
if
you
are
brave
he
answered
not
without
now
one
last
question
and
then
you
must
be
off
i
see
in
the
last
telegram
mention
made
of
fifty
lacs
i
presume
that
means
money
a
lac
is
their
term
for
a
thousand
pounds
she
answered
without
hesitation
that
will
do
said
klimo
now
go
home
and
don
t
worry
yourself
more
than
you
can
help
above
all
don
t
let
any
one
suspect
that
i
have
any
interest
in
the
case
upon
your
doing
that
will
in
a
great
measure
depend
your
safety
she
promised
to
obey
him
in
this
particular
as
in
the
others
and
then
took
her
departure
when
klimo
had
passed
into
the
adjoining
house
he
bade
his
valet
accompany
him
to
his
study
belton
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
in
a
comfortable
chair
before
his
i
have
this
morning
agreed
to
undertake
what
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
dangerous
and
at
the
same
time
most
interesting
cases
that
has
yet
come
under
my
notice
a
young
lady
the
wife
of
a
respectable
bank
inspector
has
been
twice
to
see
me
lately
with
a
very
sad
story
her
father
it
would
appear
is
an
irish
american
with
the
usual
prejudice
against
this
country
he
has
been
for
some
time
a
member
of
a
fenian
society
possibly
one
of
their
most
active
workers
in
january
last
the
executive
sent
him
to
his
country
to
arrange
for
an
exhibition
of
their
powers
since
arriving
here
the
father
has
been
seized
with
remorse
and
the
mental
strain
and
fear
thus
entailed
have
made
him
seriously
for
weeks
he
has
been
lying
at
death
s
door
in
his
daughter
s
house
hearing
nothing
from
him
the
society
has
telegraphed
again
and
again
but
without
result
in
consequence
two
of
the
chief
and
most
dangerous
members
are
coming
over
here
with
fifty
thousand
pounds
at
their
disposal
to
look
after
their
erring
brother
to
take
over
the
management
of
affairs
and
to
commence
the
slaughter
as
per
arrangement
now
as
a
peaceable
citizen
of
the
city
of
london
and
a
humble
servant
of
her
majesty
the
queen
it
is
manifestly
my
duty
to
deliver
these
rascals
into
the
hands
of
the
police
but
to
do
that
would
be
to
implicate
the
girl
s
father
and
to
kill
her
husband
s
faith
in
her
family
for
it
must
be
remembered
he
knows
nothing
of
the
father
s
fenian
tendencies
it
would
also
mix
me
up
in
a
most
undesirable
matter
at
a
time
when
i
have
the
best
reasons
for
desiring
to
keep
quiet
well
the
long
and
the
short
of
the
matter
is
that
i
have
been
thinking
the
question
out
and
i
have
arrived
at
the
following
conclusion
if
i
can
hit
upon
a
workable
scheme
i
shall
play
policeman
and
public
benefactor
checkmate
the
dynamiters
save
the
girl
and
her
father
and
reimburse
myself
to
the
extent
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
fifty
thousand
pounds
belton
think
of
that
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
money
i
should
have
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
it
but
how
will
you
do
it
sir
asked
belton
who
had
learnt
by
experience
never
to
be
surprised
at
anything
his
master
might
say
or
do
well
so
far
he
answered
it
seems
a
comparatively
easy
matter
i
see
that
the
last
telegram
was
dispatched
on
saturday
may
and
says
or
purports
to
say
sail
in
that
case
all
being
well
they
should
be
in
liverpool
some
time
thursday
so
we
have
a
clear
day
at
our
disposal
in
which
to
prepare
a
reception
for
them
i
am
to
have
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
men
in
my
possession
and
i
shall
send
you
to
liverpool
to
meet
them
once
you
have
set
eyes
on
them
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
them
until
you
have
discovered
where
they
are
domiciled
in
london
after
that
i
will
take
the
matter
in
hand
myself
at
what
hour
do
you
wish
me
to
start
for
liverpool
sir
asked
belton
first
thing
morning
his
master
replied
in
the
meantime
you
must
by
hook
or
crook
obtain
a
police
inspector
s
a
sergeant
s
and
two
constables
uniforms
with
belts
and
helmets
complete
also
i
shall
require
three
men
in
whom
i
can
place
absolute
and
implicit
confidence
they
must
be
big
fellows
with
plenty
of
pluck
and
intelligence
and
the
clothes
you
get
must
fit
them
so
that
they
shall
not
look
awkward
in
them
they
must
also
bring
plain
clothes
with
them
for
i
shall
want
two
of
them
to
undertake
a
journey
to
ireland
they
will
each
be
paid
a
hundred
pounds
for
the
job
and
to
ensure
their
silence
afterwards
do
you
think
you
can
find
me
the
men
without
disclosing
my
connection
with
the
matter
i
know
exactly
where
to
put
my
hand
upon
them
sir
remarked
belton
and
for
the
sum
you
mention
it
s
my
belief
they
d
hold
their
tongues
forever
no
matter
what
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
upon
them
very
good
you
had
better
communicate
with
them
at
once
and
tell
them
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
for
i
may
want
them
at
any
moment
on
friday
night
i
shall
probably
attempt
the
job
and
they
can
get
back
to
town
when
and
how
they
like
very
good
sir
i
ll
see
about
them
this
afternoon
without
fail
next
morning
belton
left
london
for
liverpool
with
the
photograph
of
the
mysterious
rooney
in
his
carne
had
spent
the
afternoon
with
a
fashionable
party
at
hurlingham
and
it
was
not
until
he
returned
to
his
house
that
he
received
the
telegram
he
had
instructed
his
valet
to
send
him
it
was
short
and
to
the
point
friends
arrived
reach
euston
nine
o
clock
the
station
clocks
wanted
ten
minutes
of
the
hour
when
the
hansom
containing
a
certain
curate
drove
into
the
yard
the
clergyman
paid
his
fare
and
having
inquired
the
platform
upon
which
the
liverpool
express
would
arrive
strolled
leisurely
in
that
direction
he
would
have
been
a
clever
man
who
would
have
recognized
in
this
unsophisticated
individual
either
deformed
simon
carne
of
park
lane
or
the
famous
detective
of
belverton
street
punctual
almost
to
the
moment
the
train
put
in
an
appearance
and
drew
up
beside
the
platform
a
moment
later
the
curate
was
engulfed
in
a
sea
of
passengers
a
bystander
had
he
been
sufficiently
observant
to
notice
such
a
thing
would
have
been
struck
by
the
eager
way
in
which
he
looked
about
him
and
also
by
the
way
in
which
his
manner
changed
directly
he
went
forward
to
greet
the
person
he
was
expecting
to
all
appearances
they
were
both
curates
but
their
social
positions
must
have
been
widely
different
if
their
behavior
to
each
other
could
have
been
taken
as
any
criterion
the
new
arrival
having
greeted
his
friend
turned
to
two
gentlemen
standing
beside
him
and
after
thanking
them
for
their
company
during
the
journey
wished
them
a
pleasant
holiday
in
england
and
bade
them
then
turning
to
his
friend
again
he
led
him
along
the
platform
towards
the
cab
rank
during
the
time
belton
had
been
speaking
to
the
two
men
just
referred
to
carne
had
been
studying
their
faces
attentively
one
the
taller
of
the
pair
if
his
red
hair
and
watery
blue
eyes
went
for
anything
was
evidently
maguire
the
other
was
rooney
the
man
of
the
photograph
both
were
big
burly
fellows
and
carne
felt
that
if
it
ever
came
to
a
fight
they
would
be
just
the
sort
of
men
to
offer
a
determined
resistance
arm
in
arm
the
curates
followed
the
americans
towards
the
cab
rank
reaching
it
the
latter
called
up
a
vehicle
placed
the
bags
they
carried
upon
the
roof
and
took
their
places
inside
the
driver
had
evidently
received
his
instructions
for
he
drove
off
without
delay
carne
at
once
called
up
another
cab
into
which
belton
sprang
without
ceremony
carne
pointed
to
the
cab
just
disappearing
through
the
gates
ahead
keep
that
hansom
in
sight
cabby
he
said
but
whatever
you
do
don
t
pass
it
all
right
sir
said
the
man
and
immediately
applied
the
whip
to
his
horse
when
they
turned
into
seymour
street
scarcely
twenty
yards
separated
the
two
vehicles
and
in
this
order
they
proceeded
across
the
euston
road
by
way
of
upper
woburn
place
and
tavistock
square
the
cab
passed
through
bloomsbury
square
and
turned
down
one
of
the
thoroughfares
leading
therefrom
and
made
its
way
into
a
street
flanked
on
either
side
by
tall
houses
leaning
over
the
apron
carne
gazed
up
at
the
corner
house
on
which
he
could
just
see
the
plate
setting
forth
the
name
of
the
street
what
he
saw
there
told
him
all
he
wanted
to
know
they
were
in
bellamer
street
and
it
was
plain
to
him
that
the
man
had
determined
to
thrust
themselves
upon
the
hapless
jeffreys
he
immediately
poked
his
umbrella
through
the
shutter
and
bade
the
cabman
drive
on
to
the
next
corner
and
then
pull
up
as
soon
as
the
horse
came
to
a
standstill
carne
jumped
out
and
bidding
his
companion
drive
home
crossed
the
street
and
made
his
way
back
until
he
arrived
at
a
spot
exactly
opposite
the
house
entered
by
the
two
men
his
supposition
that
they
intended
to
domicile
themselves
there
was
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
they
had
taken
their
luggage
inside
and
had
dismissed
their
cab
there
had
been
lights
in
two
of
the
windows
when
the
cab
had
passed
now
a
third
was
added
and
this
he
set
down
as
emanating
from
the
room
allotted
to
the
new
arrivals
for
upwards
of
an
hour
and
a
half
carne
remained
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
opposite
houses
watching
the
jeffrey
s
residence
the
lights
in
the
lower
room
had
by
this
time
disappeared
and
within
ten
minutes
that
on
the
first
floor
followed
suit
being
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
the
inmates
were
safely
settled
for
the
night
he
left
the
scene
of
his
vigil
and
walking
to
the
corner
of
the
street
hailed
a
hansom
and
was
driven
home
on
reaching
no
belverton
street
he
found
a
letter
lying
on
the
hall
table
addressed
to
klimo
it
was
in
a
woman
s
handwriting
and
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
guess
that
it
was
from
jeffreys
he
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
street
dear
klimo
i
am
sending
this
to
you
to
tell
you
that
my
worst
suspicions
have
been
realized
the
two
men
whose
coming
i
so
dreaded
have
arrived
and
have
taken
up
their
abode
with
us
for
my
father
s
sake
i
dare
not
turn
them
out
and
i
have
heard
from
my
husband
to
say
that
he
will
be
home
on
saturday
next
what
is
to
be
done
if
something
does
not
happen
soon
they
will
commence
their
dastardly
business
in
england
and
then
god
help
us
all
my
only
hope
is
in
him
and
you
yours
ever
gratefully
eileen
jeffreys
carne
folded
up
the
letter
with
a
grave
face
and
then
let
himself
into
porchester
house
and
went
to
bed
to
think
out
his
plan
of
action
next
morning
he
was
up
betimes
and
by
the
breakfast
hour
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
had
also
written
and
dispatched
a
note
to
the
girl
who
was
depending
so
much
upon
him
in
it
he
told
her
to
come
and
see
him
without
fail
that
morning
his
meal
finished
he
went
to
his
and
attired
himself
in
klimo
s
clothes
and
shortly
after
ten
o
clock
entered
the
detective
s
house
later
jeffreys
was
ushered
into
his
presence
as
he
greeted
her
he
noticed
that
she
looked
pale
and
wan
it
was
evident
she
had
spent
a
sleepless
night
sit
down
he
said
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
since
last
i
saw
you
the
most
terrible
thing
of
all
has
happened
she
answered
as
i
told
you
in
my
note
the
men
have
reached
england
and
are
now
living
in
our
house
you
can
imagine
what
a
shock
their
arrival
was
to
me
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
my
father
s
sake
i
could
not
refuse
them
admittance
and
yet
i
knew
that
i
had
no
right
to
take
them
in
during
my
husband
s
absence
be
that
as
it
may
they
are
there
now
and
night
george
returns
if
he
discovers
their
identity
and
suspects
their
errand
he
will
hand
them
over
to
the
police
without
a
second
thought
and
then
we
shall
be
disgraced
forever
oh
klimo
you
promised
to
help
me
can
you
not
do
so
heaven
knows
how
badly
i
need
your
aid
you
shall
have
it
now
listen
to
my
instructions
you
will
go
home
and
watch
these
men
during
the
afternoon
they
will
probably
go
out
and
the
instant
they
do
so
you
must
admit
three
of
my
servants
and
place
them
in
some
room
where
their
presence
will
not
be
suspected
by
our
enemies
a
friend
who
will
hand
you
my
card
will
call
later
on
and
as
he
will
take
command
you
must
do
your
best
to
help
him
in
every
possible
way
you
need
have
no
fear
of
my
not
doing
that
she
said
and
i
will
be
grateful
to
you
till
my
dying
day
well
we
ll
see
now
after
she
had
left
him
klimo
returned
to
porchester
house
and
sent
for
belton
he
was
out
it
appeared
but
within
he
returned
and
entered
his
master
s
presence
have
you
discovered
the
bank
asked
carne
yes
sir
i
have
said
belton
but
not
till
i
was
walked
off
my
legs
the
men
are
as
suspicious
as
wild
rabbits
and
they
dodged
and
played
about
so
that
i
began
to
think
they
d
get
away
from
me
altogether
the
bank
is
the
united
kingdom
oxford
street
branch
that
s
right
now
what
about
the
uniforms
they
re
quite
ready
sir
helmets
tunics
belts
and
trousers
complete
well
then
have
them
packed
as
i
told
you
yesterday
and
ready
to
proceed
to
bellamer
street
with
the
men
the
instant
we
get
the
information
that
the
folk
we
are
after
have
stepped
outside
the
house
door
very
good
sir
and
as
to
yourself
i
shall
join
you
at
the
house
at
ten
o
clock
or
thereabouts
we
must
if
possible
catch
them
at
their
supper
london
was
half
through
its
pleasures
that
night
when
a
tall
man
muffled
in
a
large
cloak
stepped
into
a
hansom
outside
porchester
house
park
lane
and
drove
off
in
the
direction
of
oxford
street
though
the
business
which
was
taking
him
out
would
have
presented
sufficient
dangers
to
have
deterred
many
men
who
consider
themselves
not
wanting
in
pluck
it
did
not
in
the
least
oppress
simon
carne
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
afford
him
no
small
amount
of
satisfaction
he
whistled
a
tune
to
himself
as
he
drove
along
the
lamplit
thoroughfares
and
smiled
as
sweetly
as
a
lover
thinking
of
his
mistress
when
he
reviewed
the
plot
he
had
so
cunningly
contrived
he
felt
a
glow
of
virtue
as
he
remembered
that
he
was
undertaking
the
business
in
order
to
promote
another
s
happiness
but
at
the
same
time
reflected
that
if
fate
were
willing
to
pay
him
fifty
thousand
pounds
for
his
generosity
well
it
was
so
much
the
better
for
him
reaching
mudie
s
library
his
coachman
drove
by
the
way
of
hart
street
into
bloomsbury
square
and
later
on
turned
into
bellamer
street
at
the
corner
he
stopped
his
driver
and
gave
him
some
instructions
in
a
low
voice
having
done
so
he
walked
along
the
pavement
as
far
as
no
where
he
came
to
a
standstill
as
on
the
last
occasion
that
he
had
surveyed
the
house
there
were
lights
in
three
of
the
windows
and
from
this
illumination
he
argued
that
his
men
were
at
home
without
hesitation
he
went
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
before
he
could
have
counted
fifty
it
was
opened
by
jeffreys
herself
who
looked
suspiciously
at
the
person
she
saw
before
her
it
was
evident
that
in
the
tall
man
with
moustache
and
dark
hair
she
did
not
recognize
her
elderly
acquaintance
klimo
the
detective
are
you
mrs
jeffreys
asked
the
in
a
low
voice
i
am
she
answered
pray
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
was
told
by
a
friend
to
give
you
this
card
he
thereupon
handed
to
her
a
card
on
which
was
written
the
one
word
klimo
she
glanced
at
it
and
as
if
that
magic
name
were
sufficient
to
settle
every
doubt
beckoned
to
him
to
follow
her
having
softly
closed
the
door
she
led
him
down
the
passage
until
she
arrived
at
a
door
on
her
right
hand
this
she
opened
and
signed
to
him
to
enter
it
was
a
room
that
was
half
office
half
library
i
am
to
understand
that
you
come
from
mr
klimo
she
said
trembling
under
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
what
am
i
to
do
first
be
as
calm
as
you
can
then
tell
me
where
the
men
are
with
whom
i
have
to
deal
they
are
having
their
supper
in
the
they
went
out
soon
after
luncheon
and
only
returned
an
hour
ago
very
good
now
if
you
will
conduct
me
upstairs
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
if
your
father
is
well
enough
to
sign
a
document
i
have
brought
with
me
nothing
can
be
done
until
i
have
arranged
that
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
will
take
you
to
him
but
we
must
go
quietly
for
the
men
are
so
suspicious
that
they
send
for
me
to
know
the
meaning
of
every
sound
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
your
ring
would
bring
them
out
into
the
hall
leading
the
way
up
the
stairs
she
conducted
him
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
the
door
of
which
she
opened
carefully
on
entering
carne
found
himself
in
a
bedroom
a
bed
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
on
this
lay
a
man
in
the
dim
light
for
the
gas
was
turned
down
till
it
showed
scarcely
a
glimmer
he
looked
more
like
a
skeleton
than
a
human
being
a
long
white
beard
lay
upon
the
coverlet
his
hair
was
of
the
same
color
and
the
pallor
of
his
skin
more
than
matched
both
that
he
was
conscious
was
shown
by
the
question
he
addressed
to
his
daughter
as
they
entered
what
is
it
eileen
he
asked
faintly
who
is
this
gentleman
and
why
does
he
come
to
see
me
he
is
a
friend
father
she
answered
one
who
has
come
to
save
us
from
these
wicked
men
god
bless
you
sir
said
the
invalid
and
as
he
spoke
he
made
as
if
he
would
shake
him
by
the
hand
carne
however
checked
him
do
not
move
or
speak
he
said
but
try
and
pull
yourself
together
sufficiently
to
sign
this
paper
what
is
the
document
it
is
something
without
which
i
can
take
no
sort
of
action
my
instructions
are
to
do
nothing
until
you
have
signed
it
you
need
not
be
afraid
it
will
not
hurt
you
come
sir
there
is
no
time
to
be
wasted
if
these
rascals
are
to
be
got
out
of
england
our
scheme
must
be
carried
out
to
do
that
i
will
sign
anything
i
trust
your
honor
for
its
contents
give
me
pen
and
ink
his
daughter
supported
him
in
her
arms
while
carne
dipped
a
pen
in
the
bottle
of
ink
he
had
brought
with
him
and
placed
it
in
the
tremulous
fingers
then
the
paper
being
supported
on
a
book
the
old
man
laboriously
traced
his
signature
at
the
place
indicated
when
he
had
done
so
he
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
completely
exhausted
carne
blotted
it
carefully
then
folded
the
paper
up
placed
it
in
his
pocket
and
announced
himself
ready
for
the
work
the
clock
upon
the
mantlepiece
showed
him
that
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
so
that
if
he
intended
to
act
that
night
he
knew
he
must
do
so
quickly
bidding
the
invalid
rest
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
his
safety
was
assured
he
beckoned
the
daughter
to
him
go
downstairs
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
make
sure
that
the
men
are
still
in
the
dining
room
she
did
as
he
ordered
her
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
with
the
information
that
they
had
finished
their
supper
and
had
announced
their
intention
of
going
to
bed
in
that
case
we
must
hurry
said
carne
where
are
my
men
concealed
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
that
passage
was
the
girl
s
reply
i
will
go
to
them
in
the
meantime
you
must
return
to
the
study
downstairs
where
we
will
join
you
in
five
minutes
time
just
before
we
enter
the
room
in
which
they
are
sitting
one
of
my
men
will
ring
the
bell
you
must
endeavor
to
make
the
fellows
inside
believe
that
you
are
trying
to
prevent
us
gaining
admittance
we
shall
arrest
you
and
then
deal
with
them
do
you
understand
perfectly
she
slipped
away
and
carne
hastened
to
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
scratched
with
his
upon
the
door
and
a
second
later
it
was
opened
by
a
sergeant
of
police
on
stepping
inside
he
found
two
constables
and
an
inspector
awaiting
him
is
all
prepared
belton
he
inquired
quite
prepared
sir
then
come
along
and
step
as
softly
as
you
can
as
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
couple
of
papers
and
led
the
way
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
stairs
with
infinite
care
they
made
their
way
along
the
hall
until
they
reached
the
door
where
jeffreys
joined
them
then
the
street
bell
rang
loudly
and
the
man
who
had
opened
the
front
door
a
couple
of
inches
shut
it
with
a
bang
without
further
hesitation
carne
called
upon
the
woman
to
stand
aside
while
belton
threw
open
the
door
i
tell
you
sir
you
are
mistaken
cried
the
terrified
woman
i
am
the
best
judge
of
that
said
carne
roughly
and
then
turning
to
belton
he
added
let
one
of
your
men
take
charge
of
this
woman
on
hearing
them
enter
the
two
men
they
were
in
search
of
had
risen
from
the
chairs
they
had
been
occupying
on
either
side
of
the
fire
and
stood
side
by
side
upon
the
staring
at
the
intruders
as
if
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
james
maguire
and
patrick
wake
rooney
said
carne
approaching
the
two
men
and
presenting
the
papers
he
held
in
his
hand
i
have
here
warrants
and
arrest
you
both
on
a
charge
of
being
concerned
in
a
fenian
plot
against
the
of
her
majesty
s
government
i
should
advise
you
to
submit
quietly
the
house
is
surrounded
constables
are
posted
at
all
the
doors
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
of
escape
the
men
seemed
too
thunderstruck
to
do
anything
and
submitted
quietly
to
the
process
of
handcuffing
when
they
had
been
secured
carne
turned
to
the
inspector
and
said
with
regard
to
the
other
man
who
is
ill
upstairs
septimus
o
grady
you
had
better
post
a
man
at
his
door
very
good
sir
then
turning
to
maguire
and
rooney
he
said
i
am
authorized
by
her
majesty
s
government
to
offer
you
your
choice
between
arrest
and
appearance
at
bow
street
or
immediate
return
to
america
which
do
you
choose
i
need
not
tell
you
that
we
have
proof
enough
in
our
hands
to
hang
the
pair
of
you
if
necessary
you
had
better
make
up
your
minds
as
quickly
as
possible
for
i
have
no
time
to
waste
the
men
stared
at
him
in
supreme
astonishment
you
will
not
prosecute
us
my
instructions
are
in
the
event
of
your
choosing
the
latter
alternative
to
see
that
you
leave
the
country
at
once
in
fact
i
shall
conduct
you
to
kingstown
myself
and
place
you
aboard
the
there
well
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
s
hobson
s
choice
said
maguire
i
ll
pay
you
the
compliment
of
saying
that
you
re
smarter
than
i
thought
you
d
be
how
did
you
come
to
know
we
were
in
england
because
your
departure
from
america
was
cabled
to
us
more
than
a
week
ago
you
have
been
shadowed
ever
since
you
set
foot
ashore
now
passages
have
been
booked
for
you
on
board
the
outgoing
boat
and
you
will
sail
in
her
first
however
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
sign
this
paper
pledging
yourselves
never
to
set
foot
in
england
again
and
supposing
we
do
not
sign
it
in
that
case
i
shall
take
you
both
to
bow
street
forthwith
and
you
will
come
before
the
magistrates
in
the
morning
you
know
what
that
will
mean
for
some
moments
they
remained
silent
then
maguire
said
sullenly
bedad
sir
since
there
s
nothing
else
for
it
i
consent
and
so
do
i
said
rooney
where
s
the
paper
carne
handed
them
a
document
and
they
read
it
in
turn
with
ostentatious
care
as
soon
as
they
had
professed
themselves
willing
to
append
their
signatures
to
it
the
sham
detective
took
it
to
a
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
then
ordered
them
to
be
unmanacled
so
that
they
could
come
up
in
turn
and
sign
had
they
been
less
agitated
it
is
just
possible
they
would
have
noticed
that
two
sheets
of
blotting
paper
covered
the
context
and
that
only
a
small
space
on
the
paper
which
was
of
a
tint
was
left
uncovered
then
placing
them
in
charge
of
the
police
officials
carne
left
the
room
and
went
upstairs
to
examine
their
baggage
evidently
he
discovered
there
what
he
wanted
to
know
for
when
he
returned
to
the
room
his
face
was
radiant
later
they
had
left
the
house
in
separate
cabs
rooney
was
accompanied
by
belton
and
one
of
his
subordinates
now
in
plain
clothes
while
carne
and
another
took
charge
of
maguire
at
euston
they
found
special
carriages
awaiting
them
and
the
same
procedure
was
adopted
in
ireland
the
journey
to
queenstown
proved
entirely
uneventful
not
for
one
moment
did
the
two
men
suspect
the
trick
that
was
being
played
upon
them
nevertheless
it
was
with
feelings
of
satisfaction
that
carne
and
belton
bade
them
farewell
upon
the
deck
of
the
steamer
said
maguire
as
their
captors
prepared
to
pass
over
the
side
again
an
good
luck
to
ye
i
ll
wish
ye
that
for
ye
ve
treated
us
well
though
it
s
a
scurvy
trick
ye
ve
played
us
in
turning
us
out
of
england
like
this
first
however
one
question
what
about
o
grady
the
same
course
will
be
pursued
with
him
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
move
answered
the
other
i
can
t
say
more
a
word
in
your
ear
first
said
rooney
he
leant
towards
carne
the
girl
s
a
good
one
he
said
an
ye
may
do
what
ye
can
for
her
for
she
knows
naught
of
our
business
i
ll
remember
that
if
ever
the
chance
arises
said
carne
now
on
the
wednesday
morning
following
an
elderly
gentleman
dressed
in
rather
an
antiquated
fashion
but
boasting
an
appearance
of
great
respectability
drove
up
in
a
brougham
to
the
branch
of
the
united
kingdom
bank
in
oxford
street
and
presented
a
cheque
for
no
less
a
sum
than
thousand
pounds
signed
with
the
names
of
septimus
o
grady
james
maguire
and
patrick
rooney
and
bearing
the
date
of
the
preceding
friday
the
cheque
was
in
perfect
order
and
in
spite
of
the
largeness
of
the
amount
it
was
cashed
without
hesitation
that
afternoon
klimo
received
a
visit
from
jeffreys
she
came
to
express
her
gratitude
for
his
help
and
to
ask
the
extent
of
her
debt
you
owe
me
nothing
but
your
gratitude
i
will
not
take
a
i
am
quite
well
enough
rewarded
now
said
klimo
with
a
smile
when
she
had
gone
he
took
out
his
and
consulted
it
thousand
pounds
he
said
with
a
chuckle
yes
that
is
good
i
did
not
take
her
money
but
i
have
been
rewarded
in
another
way
then
he
went
into
porchester
house
and
dressed
for
the
garden
party
at
marlborough
house
to
which
he
had
been
invited
vi
visit
in
the
night
one
bright
summer
morning
simon
carne
sat
in
his
study
and
reflected
on
the
slackness
of
things
in
general
since
he
had
rendered
such
a
signal
service
to
the
state
as
narrated
in
the
previous
chapter
he
had
done
comparatively
nothing
to
raise
himself
in
his
own
estimation
he
was
thinking
in
this
strain
when
his
butler
entered
and
announced
kelmare
sahib
the
interruption
was
a
welcome
one
and
carne
rose
to
greet
his
guest
with
every
sign
of
pleasure
on
his
face
kelmare
he
said
as
he
took
the
other
s
outstretched
hand
i
m
delighted
to
see
you
how
are
you
this
morning
as
well
as
a
man
can
hope
to
be
under
the
circumstances
replied
the
new
arrival
a
somewhat
youth
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
you
are
going
to
the
greenthorpe
wedding
of
course
i
hear
you
have
been
invited
you
are
quite
right
i
have
said
carne
and
presently
produced
a
card
from
the
basket
and
tossed
it
across
the
table
the
other
took
it
up
with
a
groan
yes
he
said
that
s
it
by
jove
and
a
document
it
is
carne
did
you
ever
hate
anybody
so
badly
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
be
scarcely
possible
to
discover
anything
you
would
not
do
to
hurt
them
no
answered
carne
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
fate
has
always
found
me
some
way
or
another
in
which
i
might
get
even
with
my
enemies
but
you
seem
very
vindictive
in
this
matter
what
s
the
reason
of
it
vindictive
said
kelmare
of
course
i
am
think
how
they
have
treated
me
a
year
ago
this
week
sophie
greenthorpe
and
i
were
engaged
old
greenthorpe
had
not
then
turned
his
business
into
a
limited
liability
company
and
my
people
were
jolly
angry
with
me
for
making
such
a
foolish
match
but
i
did
not
care
i
was
in
love
and
sophie
greenthorpe
is
as
pretty
a
girl
as
can
be
found
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
london
but
there
you
ve
seen
her
so
you
know
for
yourself
well
three
months
later
old
greenthorpe
sold
his
business
for
upwards
of
three
million
sterling
on
the
strength
of
it
he
went
into
the
house
gave
thirty
thousand
to
the
funds
of
his
party
and
would
have
received
a
baronetcy
for
his
generosity
had
his
party
not
been
shunted
out
of
power
inside
another
month
all
the
swells
had
taken
them
up
dukes
and
earls
were
as
common
at
the
old
lady
s
receptions
as
they
had
been
scarce
before
and
i
began
to
understand
that
instead
of
being
everybody
to
them
as
i
had
once
been
the
old
fellow
was
beginning
to
think
his
daughter
might
have
done
much
better
than
become
engaged
to
the
third
son
of
an
impecunious
earl
then
kilbenham
came
upon
the
scene
he
s
a
fellow
and
a
marquis
but
as
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
a
real
bad
hat
he
hasn
t
a
red
cent
in
the
world
to
bless
himself
with
and
he
wanted
money
well
just
about
as
badly
as
a
man
want
it
what
s
the
result
within
six
weeks
i
am
thrown
over
and
she
has
accepted
kilbenham
s
offer
of
marriage
society
says
what
a
good
match
and
as
if
to
endorse
it
you
receive
an
invitation
to
the
ceremony
forgive
me
but
you
are
growing
cynical
now
said
carne
as
he
lit
a
fresh
cigar
haven
t
i
good
cause
to
be
asked
kelmare
wait
till
you
ve
been
treated
as
i
have
and
then
we
ll
see
how
you
ll
feel
when
i
think
how
every
man
you
meet
speaks
of
kilbenham
and
of
the
stories
that
are
afloat
concerning
him
and
hear
the
way
old
greenthorpe
and
his
pretensions
are
laughed
at
in
the
clubs
and
sneered
at
in
the
papers
and
am
told
that
they
are
receiving
presents
of
enormous
value
from
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
from
royalty
to
the
poor
devils
of
workmen
he
still
just
because
kilbenham
is
a
marquis
and
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
millionaire
why
i
can
tell
you
it
is
enough
to
make
any
one
cynical
in
the
main
i
agree
with
you
said
carne
but
as
life
is
made
up
of
just
such
contradictions
it
seems
to
me
absurd
to
butt
your
head
against
a
stone
wall
and
then
grumble
because
it
hurts
and
you
don
t
make
any
impression
on
it
do
you
think
the
presents
are
as
wonderful
as
they
say
i
want
to
know
because
i
ve
not
given
mine
yet
in
these
days
one
gives
as
others
give
if
they
have
not
received
anything
very
good
then
a
pair
of
entrée
dishes
will
meet
the
case
if
the
reverse
well
diamonds
perhaps
or
an
old
master
that
the
americans
are
wild
to
buy
and
can
t
who
is
cynical
now
i
should
like
to
know
said
kelmare
i
was
told
this
morning
that
up
to
the
present
with
the
superb
diamonds
given
by
the
bride
s
father
they
have
totalled
a
value
of
something
like
twenty
thousand
pounds
you
surprise
me
answered
carne
i
am
surprised
myself
said
kelmare
as
he
rose
to
go
now
i
must
be
off
i
came
in
to
see
if
you
felt
inclined
for
a
week
s
cruise
in
the
channel
burgrave
has
lent
me
his
yacht
and
somehow
i
think
a
change
of
air
will
do
me
good
i
am
very
sorry
said
carne
but
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
get
away
just
now
i
have
several
important
functions
on
hand
that
will
keep
me
in
town
i
suppose
this
wedding
is
one
of
them
to
tell
the
honest
truth
i
had
scarcely
thought
of
it
replied
carne
must
you
be
off
well
then
when
kelmare
had
disappeared
carne
went
back
to
his
study
and
seated
himself
at
his
kelmare
is
a
little
he
said
and
his
pique
is
spoiling
his
judgment
he
does
not
seem
to
realize
that
he
has
come
very
well
out
of
a
jolly
bad
business
i
am
not
certain
which
i
pity
most
miss
greenthorpe
who
is
a
heartless
little
hussy
or
the
marquis
of
kilbenham
who
is
a
scoundrel
the
wedding
however
promises
to
be
a
fashionable
one
and
he
stopped
midway
rose
and
stood
against
the
staring
into
the
empty
fireplace
presently
he
flipped
the
ash
of
his
cigar
and
turned
round
it
never
struck
me
in
that
light
before
he
said
as
he
pressed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
in
the
wall
beside
him
when
it
was
answered
he
ordered
his
carriage
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
was
rolling
down
regent
street
reaching
a
jeweler
s
shop
he
pulled
the
check
string
and
the
door
having
been
opened
descended
and
went
inside
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
had
dealings
with
the
firm
and
as
soon
as
he
was
recognized
the
proprietor
hastened
forward
himself
to
wait
upon
him
i
want
a
nice
wedding
present
for
a
young
lady
he
said
when
the
other
had
asked
what
he
could
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
him
diamonds
i
think
for
preference
a
tray
containing
hairpins
brooches
rings
and
aigrettes
set
with
stones
was
put
before
him
but
carne
was
not
satisfied
he
wanted
something
better
he
said
something
a
little
more
imposing
when
he
left
the
shop
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
had
chosen
a
diamond
bracelet
for
which
he
had
paid
the
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
as
carne
rolled
down
the
street
he
took
the
bracelet
from
its
case
and
glanced
at
it
he
had
long
since
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
line
of
action
and
having
done
so
was
now
prepared
to
start
business
without
delay
on
leaving
the
shop
he
had
ordered
his
coachman
to
drive
home
but
on
second
thoughts
he
changed
his
mind
and
once
more
pulling
the
check
string
substituted
berkeley
square
for
park
lane
i
must
be
thoroughly
convinced
in
my
own
mind
he
said
before
i
do
anything
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
will
be
to
see
old
greenthorpe
himself
without
delay
i
think
i
have
a
good
and
sufficient
excuse
in
my
pocket
at
any
rate
i
ll
try
it
on
reaching
the
residence
in
question
he
instructed
his
footman
to
inquire
whether
greenthorpe
was
at
home
and
if
so
if
he
would
see
him
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
was
soon
forthcoming
and
a
moment
later
carne
and
greenthorpe
were
greeting
each
other
in
the
library
delighted
to
see
you
my
dear
sir
the
latter
said
as
he
shook
his
guest
warmly
by
the
hand
at
the
same
time
hoping
that
old
sir
mowbray
mowbray
next
door
who
was
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
and
looked
down
on
the
plutocracy
could
see
and
recognize
the
magnificent
equipage
standing
before
his
house
this
is
most
kind
of
you
and
indeed
i
take
it
as
most
friendly
too
carne
s
face
was
as
smiling
and
fascinating
as
it
was
wont
to
be
but
an
acute
observer
might
have
read
in
the
curves
of
his
lips
a
little
of
the
contempt
he
felt
for
the
man
before
him
matthew
greenthorpe
s
face
and
figure
betrayed
his
origin
as
plainly
as
any
words
could
have
done
if
this
had
not
been
sufficient
his
dress
and
the
profusion
of
jewelry
principally
diamonds
that
decked
his
person
would
have
told
the
tale
in
appearance
he
was
short
stout
very
red
about
the
face
and
made
up
what
he
lacked
in
breeding
by
an
effusive
familiarity
that
sometimes
bordered
on
the
offensive
i
am
afraid
said
carne
when
his
host
had
finished
speaking
that
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
for
intruding
on
you
at
such
an
early
hour
i
wanted
however
to
thank
you
personally
for
the
kind
invitation
you
have
sent
me
to
be
present
at
your
daughter
s
wedding
i
trust
you
will
be
able
to
come
replied
greenthorpe
a
little
anxiously
for
he
was
eager
that
the
world
should
know
that
he
and
the
now
famous
simon
carne
were
on
familiar
terms
that
is
exactly
what
has
brought
me
to
see
you
said
carne
i
regret
to
say
i
hardly
know
yet
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
give
myself
that
pleasure
or
not
an
important
complication
has
arisen
in
connection
with
some
property
in
which
i
am
interested
and
it
is
just
possible
that
i
shall
be
called
to
the
continent
within
the
next
few
days
my
object
in
calling
upon
you
this
morning
was
to
ask
you
to
permit
me
to
withhold
my
answer
until
i
am
at
liberty
to
speak
more
definitely
as
to
my
arrangements
by
all
means
by
all
means
answered
his
host
placing
himself
with
legs
wide
apart
upon
the
hearthrug
and
rattling
the
money
in
his
trouser
pockets
take
just
as
long
as
you
like
so
long
as
you
don
t
say
you
can
t
come
me
and
the
missus
hem
i
mean
greenthorpe
and
i
are
looking
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
your
society
and
i
can
tell
you
we
sha
n
t
think
our
company
complete
if
we
don
t
have
you
with
us
i
am
extremely
flattered
said
carne
sweetly
and
you
may
be
sure
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
i
am
not
among
your
guests
hear
hear
to
that
sir
replied
the
old
gentleman
we
shall
be
a
merry
party
and
i
trust
a
distinguished
one
we
hope
to
have
had
royalty
present
among
us
but
unfortunately
there
were
special
reasons
that
i
am
hardly
privileged
to
mention
which
prevented
it
however
the
duke
of
rugby
and
his
duchess
the
father
and
mother
of
my
future
you
know
are
coming
the
earl
of
boxmoor
and
his
countess
have
accepted
lord
southam
and
his
lady
baronets
or
so
and
as
many
members
of
parliament
and
their
wives
as
you
can
count
on
one
hand
there
ll
be
a
ball
the
night
before
given
by
the
mayor
at
the
assembly
rooms
a
dinner
to
the
tenants
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremony
and
a
ball
in
my
own
house
after
the
young
couple
have
gone
away
you
may
take
it
from
me
my
dear
sir
that
nothing
on
a
similar
scale
has
even
been
seen
at
market
stopford
before
i
can
quite
believe
it
said
carne
it
will
mark
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
country
it
will
do
more
than
that
sir
the
festivities
alone
will
cost
me
a
cool
five
thousand
pounds
at
first
was
all
for
having
it
in
town
but
i
was
persuaded
out
of
it
after
all
a
country
house
is
better
suited
to
such
jinks
and
we
mean
to
do
it
well
he
took
carne
familiarly
by
the
button
of
his
coat
and
sinking
his
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper
asked
him
to
hazard
a
guess
how
much
the
whole
affair
presents
and
all
would
cost
carne
shook
his
head
i
have
not
the
very
remotest
notion
he
said
but
if
you
wish
me
to
guess
i
will
put
it
at
fifty
thousand
pounds
not
enough
by
half
sir
not
enough
by
half
why
i
ll
let
you
into
a
secret
that
even
my
wife
knows
nothing
about
as
he
spoke
he
crossed
the
room
to
a
large
safe
in
the
wall
this
he
unlocked
and
having
done
so
took
from
it
an
oblong
box
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
this
he
placed
on
the
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
then
having
looked
out
into
the
hall
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
about
shut
and
locked
the
door
then
turning
to
carne
he
said
i
don
t
know
what
you
may
think
sir
but
there
are
some
people
i
know
as
try
to
insinuate
that
if
you
have
money
you
can
t
have
taste
now
i
ve
got
the
money
here
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
tapped
himself
proudly
on
the
chest
and
i
m
going
to
convince
you
sir
that
i
ve
got
as
pretty
an
idea
of
taste
as
any
man
could
wish
to
have
this
box
will
prove
it
so
saying
he
unwrapped
the
tissue
paper
and
displayed
to
carne
s
astonished
gaze
a
large
gilded
casket
richly
chased
standing
upon
four
massive
feet
there
sir
you
see
he
said
an
artistic
bit
of
workmanship
and
i
ll
ask
you
to
guess
what
it
s
for
carne
however
shook
his
head
i
m
afraid
i
m
but
a
poor
hand
at
guessing
but
if
i
must
venture
an
opinion
i
should
say
a
jewel
case
thereupon
greenthorpe
lifted
the
lid
and
you
would
be
wrong
sir
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
for
that
box
has
been
constructed
to
contain
exactly
fifty
thousand
sovereigns
and
on
her
wedding
day
it
will
be
filled
and
presented
to
the
bride
as
a
token
of
her
father
s
affection
now
if
that
isn
t
in
good
taste
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
is
i
am
astonished
at
your
munificence
said
carne
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
you
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
such
a
present
before
i
thought
you
d
say
so
i
said
to
myself
when
i
ordered
that
box
mr
carne
is
the
best
judge
of
what
is
artistic
in
england
and
i
ll
take
his
opinion
about
i
suppose
your
daughter
has
received
some
valuable
presents
valuable
sir
why
that
s
no
name
for
it
i
should
put
down
what
has
come
in
up
to
the
present
at
not
a
penny
under
twenty
thousand
pounds
why
you
may
not
believe
it
sir
but
greenthorpe
has
presented
the
young
couple
with
a
complete
of
solid
gold
i
doubt
if
such
another
has
been
seen
in
this
country
before
i
should
say
it
would
be
worth
a
burglar
s
while
to
pay
a
visit
to
your
house
on
the
wedding
day
said
carne
with
a
smile
he
wouldn
t
get
much
for
his
pains
said
the
old
gentleman
warmly
i
have
already
provided
for
that
contingency
the
will
be
used
as
a
for
the
time
being
as
there
is
a
big
safe
like
that
over
yonder
in
the
wall
this
week
bars
are
being
placed
on
all
the
windows
and
on
the
night
preceding
and
also
on
the
wedding
day
one
of
my
gardeners
will
keep
watch
in
the
room
itself
while
one
of
the
village
policemen
will
mount
guard
at
the
door
in
the
passage
between
them
they
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
keep
out
any
burglars
who
may
wish
to
try
their
hands
upon
the
presents
what
do
you
think
at
that
moment
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
and
an
instant
later
the
entered
the
room
on
seeing
simon
carne
she
paused
upon
the
threshold
with
a
gesture
of
embarrassment
and
made
as
if
she
would
retreat
carne
however
was
too
quick
for
her
he
advanced
and
held
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
miss
greenthorpe
he
said
looking
her
steadily
in
the
face
you
father
has
just
been
telling
me
of
the
many
beautiful
presents
you
have
received
i
am
sure
i
congratulate
you
most
heartily
with
your
permission
i
will
add
my
mite
to
the
list
such
as
it
is
i
would
beg
your
acceptance
of
it
so
saying
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
case
containing
the
bracelet
he
had
that
morning
purchased
unfastening
it
he
withdrew
the
circlet
and
clasped
it
upon
her
wrist
so
great
was
her
surprise
and
delight
that
for
some
moments
she
was
at
a
loss
how
to
express
her
thanks
when
she
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
and
her
speech
she
attempted
to
do
so
but
carne
stopped
her
you
must
not
thank
me
too
much
he
said
or
i
shall
begin
to
think
i
have
done
a
meritorious
action
i
trust
lord
kilbenham
is
well
he
was
very
well
when
i
last
saw
him
answered
the
girl
after
a
momentary
pause
which
carne
noticed
but
he
is
so
busy
just
now
that
we
see
very
little
of
each
other
all
the
way
home
simon
carne
sat
wrapped
in
a
brown
study
on
reaching
his
residence
he
went
straight
to
his
study
and
to
his
where
he
engaged
himself
for
some
minutes
jotting
down
certain
memoranda
on
a
sheet
of
when
he
had
finished
he
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
that
belton
his
valet
should
be
sent
to
him
belton
he
said
when
the
person
he
wanted
had
arrived
in
answer
to
the
summons
on
thursday
next
i
shall
go
down
to
market
stopford
to
attend
the
wedding
of
the
marquis
of
kilbenham
with
miss
greenthorpe
you
will
of
course
accompany
me
in
the
meantime
here
he
handed
him
the
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
he
had
been
writing
i
want
you
to
attend
to
these
few
details
some
of
these
articles
i
m
afraid
you
will
find
rather
difficult
to
obtain
but
at
any
cost
i
must
have
them
to
take
down
to
the
country
with
me
belton
took
the
paper
and
left
the
room
with
it
and
for
the
time
being
carne
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
the
sun
was
in
the
act
of
setting
on
the
day
immediately
preceding
the
wedding
when
simon
carne
and
his
faithful
valet
reached
the
wayside
station
of
market
stopford
as
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
a
footman
wearing
the
greenthorpe
livery
opened
the
door
of
the
reserved
carriage
and
informed
his
master
s
guest
that
a
brougham
was
waiting
outside
the
station
to
convey
him
to
his
destination
belton
was
to
follow
with
the
luggage
in
the
servants
omnibus
on
arrival
at
greenthorpe
park
simon
carne
was
received
by
his
host
and
hostess
in
the
hall
the
portion
of
which
was
furnished
as
a
judging
from
the
number
of
guests
passing
repassing
and
lolling
about
in
the
easy
chairs
most
of
the
company
invited
had
already
arrived
when
he
had
greeted
those
with
whom
he
was
familiar
and
had
taken
a
cup
of
tea
from
the
hands
of
the
who
was
dispensing
it
at
a
small
table
near
the
great
oak
fireplace
he
set
himself
to
be
agreeable
to
those
about
him
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
which
he
was
escorted
to
his
bedroom
a
pretty
room
situated
in
the
main
portion
of
the
building
at
the
head
of
the
grand
staircase
he
found
belton
awaiting
him
there
his
luggage
had
been
unpacked
and
a
glance
at
his
watch
told
him
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
prepare
for
dinner
well
belton
he
said
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
beside
the
window
that
looked
out
over
the
rose
garden
here
we
are
and
the
next
question
is
how
are
we
going
to
succeed
i
have
never
known
you
to
fail
yet
sir
replied
the
deferential
valet
and
i
don
t
suppose
you
ll
do
so
on
this
occasion
you
flatter
me
belton
but
i
will
not
be
so
falsely
modest
as
to
say
that
your
praise
is
altogether
undeserved
this
however
is
a
case
of
more
than
usual
delicacy
and
danger
and
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
play
our
cards
with
considerable
care
when
i
have
examined
this
house
i
shall
elaborate
my
plans
more
fully
we
have
none
too
much
time
for
the
attempt
must
be
made
night
you
have
brought
down
with
you
the
things
i
mentioned
on
that
list
i
suppose
they
are
in
these
chests
sir
said
belton
they
make
a
precious
heavy
load
and
once
or
twice
i
was
fearful
lest
they
might
arouse
suspicion
you
need
have
no
fear
my
good
belton
said
carne
i
have
a
very
plausible
excuse
to
account
for
their
presence
here
everyone
by
this
time
knows
that
i
am
a
great
student
and
also
that
i
never
travel
without
at
least
two
cases
of
books
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
harmless
fad
here
is
my
key
open
the
box
standing
nearest
to
you
belton
did
as
he
was
commanded
when
it
was
seen
that
it
was
filled
to
its
utmost
holding
capacity
with
books
no
one
would
think
said
carne
with
a
smile
at
the
astonishment
depicted
on
the
other
s
face
that
there
are
only
two
layers
of
volumes
there
would
they
if
you
lift
out
the
tray
upon
which
they
rest
you
will
discover
that
the
balance
of
the
box
is
now
occupied
by
the
things
you
placed
in
it
unknown
to
you
i
had
the
trays
fitted
after
you
had
packed
the
others
there
is
nothing
like
being
prepared
for
all
emergencies
now
pay
attention
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
i
have
learned
that
the
wedding
presents
including
the
fifty
thousand
sovereigns
presented
by
greenthorpe
to
his
daughter
in
that
absurd
casket
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
will
be
on
view
afternoon
in
the
and
before
the
ball
commences
they
will
be
placed
in
the
safe
one
of
greenthorpe
s
most
trusted
servants
will
keep
watch
over
them
in
the
room
while
a
constable
will
be
on
duty
in
the
lobby
outside
bars
have
been
placed
on
all
windows
and
as
i
understand
the
village
police
will
patrol
the
building
at
intervals
during
the
night
the
problem
of
how
we
are
to
get
hold
of
them
would
seem
rather
a
hard
nut
to
crack
would
it
not
i
must
confess
i
don
t
see
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
at
all
sir
said
belton
well
we
ll
see
i
have
a
plan
in
my
head
now
but
before
i
can
adopt
it
i
must
make
a
few
inquiries
i
believe
there
is
a
staircase
leading
from
the
end
of
this
corridor
down
to
the
lobby
outside
the
billiard
and
if
this
is
so
we
shall
have
to
make
use
of
it
it
must
be
your
business
to
discover
at
what
time
the
custodians
of
the
treasure
have
their
last
meal
when
you
have
found
that
out
let
me
know
now
you
had
better
get
me
ready
for
dinner
as
soon
as
possible
when
carne
retired
to
rest
that
evening
his
inimitable
valet
was
in
a
position
to
report
that
the
sentries
were
already
installed
and
that
their
supper
had
been
taken
to
them
by
greenthorpe
s
orders
at
ten
o
clock
precisely
by
one
of
the
who
had
been
instructed
to
look
after
them
very
good
said
carne
i
think
i
see
my
way
now
i
ll
sleep
on
my
scheme
and
let
you
know
what
decision
i
have
come
to
in
the
morning
if
we
pull
this
little
business
off
successfully
there
will
be
ten
thousand
pounds
for
you
to
pay
into
your
credit
my
friend
belton
bowed
and
thanked
his
master
without
a
sign
of
emotion
upon
his
face
after
which
simon
carne
went
to
bed
when
he
was
called
next
morning
he
discovered
a
perfect
summer
day
brilliant
sunshine
streamed
in
at
the
windows
and
the
songs
of
the
birds
came
iron
the
trees
outside
an
excellent
augury
he
said
to
himself
as
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
donned
the
heavy
his
valet
held
open
for
him
miss
greenthorpe
my
compliments
to
you
my
lord
marquis
is
not
the
only
man
upon
whom
you
are
conferring
happiness
his
good
humor
did
not
leave
him
for
when
he
descended
to
the
an
hour
later
his
face
was
radiant
with
smiles
and
every
one
admitted
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
meet
a
more
charming
companion
during
the
morning
he
was
occupied
in
the
library
writing
letters
at
one
he
lunched
with
his
none
of
the
family
being
present
and
at
went
off
to
dress
for
the
wedding
ceremony
this
important
business
completed
a
move
was
made
for
the
church
and
in
something
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
nuptial
knot
was
tied
and
miss
sophie
greenthorpe
only
daughter
of
matthew
greenthorpe
erstwhile
grocer
and
provision
merchant
of
little
bexter
street
tottenham
court
road
left
the
building
on
her
husband
s
arm
marchioness
of
kilbenham
and
future
duchess
of
rugby
simon
carne
and
his
followed
in
her
wake
down
the
aisle
and
having
entered
their
carriages
returned
to
the
park
the
ball
that
evening
was
an
acknowledged
success
but
though
he
was
an
excellent
dancer
and
had
his
choice
of
the
prettiest
women
in
the
room
carne
was
evidently
ill
at
ease
the
number
of
times
he
stealthily
examined
his
watch
said
this
as
plainly
as
any
words
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
last
guest
had
scarcely
arrived
before
he
left
the
and
passed
down
the
lobby
towards
the
back
stopping
to
glance
at
the
door
as
he
expected
it
was
closed
and
a
stalwart
provincial
policeman
stood
on
guard
before
it
he
made
a
jocular
reference
about
the
treasure
the
constable
was
guarding
and
with
a
laugh
at
himself
for
forgetting
the
way
to
his
bedroom
retraced
his
steps
to
the
stairs
up
which
he
passed
to
his
own
apartment
belton
was
awaiting
him
there
it
is
ten
minutes
to
ten
belton
he
said
abruptly
it
must
be
now
or
never
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
hang
about
there
until
the
tray
upon
which
the
suppers
of
the
guard
are
placed
is
prepared
when
the
footman
starts
with
it
for
the
accompany
him
and
as
he
opens
the
green
baize
door
leading
into
the
house
manage
by
hook
or
crook
to
hold
him
in
conversation
say
something
and
interrupt
yourself
by
a
severe
fit
of
coughing
that
will
give
me
my
cue
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
as
i
come
downstairs
be
sure
that
the
man
puts
his
tray
down
on
the
slab
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
renders
me
assistance
i
will
manage
the
rest
now
be
off
belton
bowed
respectfully
and
left
the
room
as
he
did
so
carne
crossed
to
the
and
unlocked
a
small
case
standing
upon
it
from
this
he
took
a
tiny
scent
bottle
containing
perhaps
half
an
ounce
of
white
powder
this
he
slipped
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
then
made
for
the
door
on
the
top
of
the
back
staircase
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
to
listen
he
heard
the
spring
of
the
green
baize
door
in
the
passage
below
creak
as
it
was
pushed
open
next
moment
he
distinguished
belton
s
voice
it
s
true
as
i
m
standing
here
he
was
saying
as
i
went
up
the
stairs
with
the
governor
s
hot
water
there
she
was
coming
along
the
passage
i
stood
back
to
let
her
pass
and
as
i
did
she
here
the
narrative
was
interrupted
by
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
on
hearing
this
carne
descended
the
stairs
and
when
he
had
got
down
saw
the
footman
and
his
valet
coming
along
the
passage
below
at
the
same
instant
he
must
have
caught
his
foot
in
the
stair
carpet
for
he
tripped
and
fell
headlong
to
the
bottom
heavens
live
cried
belton
i
do
believe
that
s
my
governor
and
he
s
killed
at
the
same
time
he
ran
forward
to
the
injured
man
s
assistance
carne
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
just
as
he
had
fallen
his
head
thrown
back
his
eyes
shut
and
his
body
curled
up
and
motionless
belton
turned
to
the
footman
who
still
stood
holding
the
tray
where
he
had
stopped
on
seeing
the
accident
and
said
put
down
those
things
and
go
and
find
greenthorpe
as
quickly
as
you
can
tell
him
carne
has
fallen
downstairs
and
i
m
afraid
is
seriously
injured
the
footman
immediately
disappeared
his
back
was
scarcely
turned
however
before
carne
was
on
his
feet
excellent
my
dear
belton
he
whispered
and
as
he
spoke
he
slipped
his
fingers
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
hand
me
up
that
tray
but
be
quiet
or
the
policeman
round
the
corner
will
hear
you
belton
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
carne
thereupon
sprinkled
upon
the
suppers
provided
for
the
two
men
some
of
the
white
powder
from
the
bottle
he
had
taken
from
his
this
done
he
resumed
his
place
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
while
belton
kneeling
over
him
and
supporting
his
head
waited
for
assistance
very
few
minutes
elapsed
before
greenthorpe
with
his
scared
face
appeared
upon
the
scene
at
his
direction
belton
and
the
footman
carried
the
unconscious
gentleman
to
his
bedroom
and
placed
him
upon
his
bed
restoratives
were
administered
and
in
something
under
ten
minutes
the
injured
man
once
more
opened
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
feebly
what
has
happened
you
have
met
with
a
slight
accident
my
dear
sir
said
the
old
gentleman
but
you
are
better
now
you
fell
downstairs
as
if
he
scarcely
comprehended
what
was
said
carne
feebly
repeated
the
last
sentence
after
his
host
and
then
closed
his
eyes
again
when
he
opened
them
once
more
it
was
to
beg
greenthorpe
to
leave
him
and
return
to
his
guests
downstairs
after
a
small
amount
of
pressing
the
latter
consented
to
do
so
and
retired
taking
the
footman
with
him
the
first
use
carne
made
of
their
departure
was
to
turn
to
belton
the
powder
will
take
effect
in
five
hours
he
said
see
that
you
have
all
the
things
prepared
they
are
quite
ready
replied
belton
i
arranged
them
this
evening
very
good
said
carne
now
i
am
going
to
sleep
in
real
earnest
so
saying
he
closed
his
eyes
and
resigned
himself
to
slumber
as
composedly
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
common
had
occurred
the
clock
on
the
stables
had
struck
three
when
he
woke
again
belton
was
still
sleeping
peacefully
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
been
repeatedly
shaken
that
he
became
conscious
that
it
was
time
to
get
up
wake
up
said
carne
it
is
three
o
clock
and
time
for
us
to
be
about
our
business
unlock
that
box
and
get
out
the
things
belton
did
as
he
was
ordered
placing
the
packets
as
he
took
them
from
the
case
in
small
gladstone
bags
having
done
this
he
went
to
one
of
his
master
s
trunks
and
took
from
it
two
suits
of
clothes
a
pair
of
wigs
two
excellently
contrived
false
beards
and
a
couple
of
soft
felt
hats
these
he
placed
upon
the
bed
ten
minutes
later
he
had
assisted
his
master
to
change
into
one
of
the
suits
and
when
this
was
done
waited
for
further
instructions
before
you
dress
take
a
tumbler
from
that
table
and
go
downstairs
if
you
should
meet
anyone
say
that
you
are
going
to
the
butler
s
pantry
in
search
of
filtered
water
as
you
have
used
all
the
drinking
water
in
this
room
the
ball
should
be
over
by
this
time
and
the
guests
in
bed
ago
ascertain
if
this
is
the
case
and
as
you
return
glance
at
the
policeman
on
duty
outside
the
door
let
me
know
his
condition
very
good
sir
said
belton
and
taking
a
tumbler
from
the
table
in
question
he
left
the
room
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
had
returned
to
report
that
with
the
exception
of
the
corridor
outside
the
the
house
was
in
darkness
and
how
is
the
guardian
of
the
door
carne
inquired
fast
asleep
said
belton
and
snoring
like
a
pig
sir
that
is
right
said
carne
the
man
inside
should
be
the
same
or
that
powder
has
failed
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
we
ll
give
them
longer
however
and
then
get
to
work
you
had
better
dress
yourself
while
belton
was
making
himself
up
to
resemble
his
master
carne
sat
in
an
easy
chair
by
his
reading
ruskin
s
of
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
of
his
many
peculiarities
that
he
could
withdraw
his
thoughts
from
any
subject
however
much
it
might
hitherto
have
engrossed
him
and
fasten
them
upon
another
without
once
allowing
them
to
wander
back
to
their
original
channel
as
the
stable
clock
chimed
the
he
put
the
book
aside
and
sprang
to
his
feet
if
you
re
ready
belton
he
said
switch
off
the
electric
light
and
open
that
door
when
this
had
been
done
he
bade
his
valet
wait
in
the
bedroom
while
he
crept
down
the
stairs
on
on
turning
into
the
lobby
he
discovered
the
rural
policeman
propped
up
in
the
corner
fast
asleep
his
heavy
breathing
echoed
down
the
corridors
and
one
moment
s
inspection
showed
carne
that
from
him
he
had
nothing
to
fear
unlocking
the
door
with
a
key
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
he
entered
the
room
to
find
the
gardener
like
the
policeman
fast
asleep
in
an
armchair
by
the
window
he
crossed
to
him
and
after
a
careful
examination
of
his
breathing
lifted
one
of
his
eyelids
excellent
he
said
nothing
could
be
better
now
when
belton
comes
we
shall
be
ready
for
business
so
saying
he
left
the
room
again
and
went
softly
up
the
stairs
to
find
his
valet
the
latter
was
awaiting
him
and
before
a
witness
had
there
been
one
could
have
counted
twenty
they
were
standing
in
the
together
it
was
a
large
apartment
luxuriously
furnished
with
a
bow
window
at
one
end
and
an
alcove
surrounded
with
seats
at
the
other
in
this
alcove
cleverly
hidden
by
the
wainscoting
as
greenthorpe
had
once
been
at
some
pains
to
point
out
to
simon
carne
there
existed
a
large
iron
safe
of
the
latest
pattern
the
secret
was
an
ingenious
one
and
would
have
baffled
any
ordinary
craftsman
carne
however
as
has
already
been
explained
was
far
from
being
a
commonplace
member
of
his
profession
turning
to
belton
he
said
give
me
the
tools
these
being
forthcoming
in
something
less
than
ten
minutes
he
had
picked
the
lock
and
was
master
of
the
safe
s
contents
when
these
including
the
fifty
thousand
sovereigns
had
been
safely
carried
upstairs
and
stowed
away
in
the
portmanteaux
and
chests
and
the
safe
had
been
filled
with
the
spurious
jewelry
he
had
brought
with
him
for
that
purpose
he
signed
to
belton
to
bring
him
a
long
pair
of
steps
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
which
had
been
used
for
securing
the
skylight
above
the
these
he
placed
in
such
a
position
as
would
enable
him
to
reach
the
window
with
a
instrument
and
a
hand
as
true
as
the
eye
that
guided
it
he
quickly
extracted
a
square
of
colored
glass
filed
through
the
catch
and
was
soon
standing
on
the
leads
outside
a
few
moments
later
the
ladder
which
had
already
rendered
him
such
signal
service
had
enabled
him
to
descend
into
the
garden
on
the
other
side
there
he
arranged
a
succession
of
footsteps
in
the
soft
mould
and
having
done
so
returned
to
the
roof
carefully
wiped
the
end
of
the
ladder
so
that
it
should
not
betray
him
and
climbed
down
into
the
room
below
pulling
it
after
him
i
think
we
have
finished
now
he
said
to
belton
as
he
took
a
last
look
at
the
recumbent
guardians
of
the
room
these
gentlemen
sleep
soundly
so
we
will
not
disturb
them
further
come
let
us
retire
to
bed
in
less
than
he
was
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
next
morning
he
was
still
confined
to
his
room
by
his
accident
though
he
expressed
himself
as
suffering
but
slight
pain
every
one
was
quick
to
sympathize
with
him
and
numerous
messages
were
conveyed
to
him
expressive
of
sorrow
that
he
should
have
met
with
his
accident
at
such
a
time
of
general
rejoicing
at
ten
o
clock
the
first
batch
of
guests
took
their
departure
it
was
arranged
that
the
duke
and
duchess
of
rugby
the
earl
and
countess
of
raxter
and
simon
carne
who
was
to
be
carried
downstairs
should
travel
up
to
town
together
by
the
special
train
leaving
immediately
after
lunch
when
they
bade
their
host
the
later
was
nearly
overcome
i
m
sure
it
has
been
a
real
downright
pleasure
to
me
to
entertain
you
carne
he
said
as
he
stood
by
the
carriage
door
and
shook
his
guest
warmly
by
the
hand
there
is
only
one
thing
bad
about
it
and
that
is
your
accident
you
must
not
speak
of
that
said
carne
with
a
little
wave
of
his
hand
the
pleasure
i
have
derived
from
my
visit
to
you
amply
compensates
me
for
such
a
minor
inconvenience
so
saying
he
shook
hands
and
drove
away
to
catch
his
train
next
morning
it
was
announced
in
all
the
society
papers
that
owing
to
an
unfortunate
accident
he
had
sustained
while
visiting
matthew
greenthorpe
at
greenthorpe
park
on
the
occasion
of
his
daughter
s
marriage
simon
carne
would
be
unable
to
fulfill
any
of
the
engagements
he
might
have
entered
into
any
intelligent
reader
of
the
aforesaid
papers
might
have
been
excused
had
he
pictured
the
gentleman
in
question
confined
to
his
bed
tended
by
skilled
nurses
and
watched
over
by
the
most
fashionable
west
end
physicians
obtainable
for
love
or
money
they
would
doubtless
therefore
have
been
surprised
could
they
have
seen
him
at
a
late
hour
on
the
following
evening
hard
at
work
in
the
laboratory
he
had
constructed
at
the
top
of
his
house
as
hale
and
hearty
a
man
as
any
to
be
found
in
the
great
metropolis
now
those
apostle
spoons
he
was
saying
as
he
turned
from
the
crucible
at
which
he
was
engaged
to
belton
who
was
busy
at
a
side
table
the
diamonds
are
safely
disposed
of
their
settings
are
melted
down
and
when
these
spoons
have
been
added
to
the
list
he
will
be
a
wise
man
who
can
find
in
my
possession
any
trace
of
the
famous
wedding
presents
he
was
sitting
before
the
fire
in
his
study
next
morning
with
his
left
foot
lying
bound
up
upon
a
neighboring
chair
when
ram
gafur
announced
kelmare
sahib
so
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
under
the
weather
carne
said
the
as
he
shook
hands
i
only
heard
of
your
accident
from
baxter
last
night
or
i
should
have
been
round
before
beastly
hard
luck
but
you
shouldn
t
have
gone
to
the
wedding
you
know
and
pray
why
not
you
see
for
yourself
you
haven
t
profited
by
your
visit
have
you
that
all
depends
upon
what
you
consider
profit
replied
carne
i
was
an
actor
in
an
interesting
society
spectacle
i
was
permitted
an
opportunity
of
observing
my
in
many
new
lights
personally
i
think
i
did
very
well
besides
that
to
be
laid
up
just
now
is
not
altogether
a
thing
to
be
despised
as
you
seem
to
imagine
what
do
you
mean
it
isn
t
everybody
who
can
boast
such
a
valid
excuse
for
declining
invitations
as
i
now
possess
said
carne
when
i
tell
you
that
i
had
a
dinner
a
lecture
at
the
imperial
institute
two
at
homes
and
three
dances
on
my
list
for
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
now
i
am
able
to
decline
every
one
of
them
without
risk
of
giving
offense
or
fear
of
hurting
the
susceptibilities
of
any
one
if
you
don
t
call
that
luck
i
do
and
now
tell
me
what
has
brought
you
here
for
i
suppose
you
have
some
reason
other
than
friendship
for
this
early
call
when
you
came
in
i
observed
that
you
were
bursting
with
importance
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
that
you
have
abandoned
your
yachting
trip
and
are
going
to
get
married
you
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
all
the
same
i
have
the
greatest
and
most
glorious
news
for
you
it
isn
t
every
day
a
man
finds
providence
taking
up
his
case
and
entering
into
judgment
against
his
enemies
for
him
that
is
my
position
haven
t
you
heard
the
news
what
news
asked
carne
innocently
the
greatest
of
all
possible
news
answered
kelmare
and
one
which
concerns
you
my
dear
fellow
you
may
not
believe
it
but
it
was
discovered
last
evening
that
the
wedding
presents
have
all
been
stolen
including
the
fifty
thousand
sovereigns
presented
to
the
bride
in
the
now
famous
jeweled
casket
what
do
you
think
of
that
surely
you
must
be
joking
said
carrie
incredulously
i
can
not
believe
it
nevertheless
it
s
a
fact
replied
kelmare
but
when
did
it
happen
and
how
did
they
discover
it
asked
carne
when
it
took
place
nobody
can
tell
but
they
discovered
it
when
they
came
to
put
the
presents
together
after
the
guests
had
departed
on
the
morning
after
the
wedding
old
greenthorpe
had
visited
the
safe
himself
and
glanced
casually
at
its
contents
just
to
see
that
they
were
all
right
you
know
but
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
when
they
began
to
do
them
up
that
they
discovered
that
every
single
article
of
value
the
place
contained
had
been
abstracted
and
dummies
substituted
their
investigation
proved
that
the
had
been
tampered
with
and
one
could
see
unmistakable
footmarks
on
the
flower
beds
outside
good
gracious
said
carne
this
is
news
indeed
what
a
haul
the
thieves
must
have
had
to
be
sure
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
even
now
but
i
thought
they
had
a
gardener
in
the
room
a
policeman
at
the
door
and
a
patrol
outside
and
that
old
greenthorpe
went
to
sleep
with
the
keys
of
the
room
and
safe
under
his
pillow
quite
right
said
kelmare
so
he
did
that
s
the
mysterious
part
of
it
the
two
chaps
swear
positively
that
they
were
wide
awake
all
night
and
that
nothing
was
tampered
with
while
they
were
there
who
the
thieves
were
and
how
they
became
so
familiar
with
the
place
are
riddles
that
it
would
puzzle
the
sphinx
or
your
friend
klimo
next
door
to
unravel
what
an
unfortunate
thing
said
carne
it
s
to
be
hoped
the
police
will
catch
them
before
they
have
time
to
dispose
of
their
booty
you
are
thinking
of
your
bracelet
i
suppose
it
may
seem
egotistical
but
i
must
confess
i
was
and
now
i
suppose
you
ll
stay
to
lunch
i
m
afraid
that
s
impossible
there
are
at
least
five
families
who
have
not
heard
the
news
and
i
feel
that
it
is
my
bounden
duty
to
enlighten
them
you
re
quite
right
it
is
not
often
a
man
has
such
glorious
vengeance
to
chronicle
it
behooves
you
to
make
the
most
of
it
the
other
looked
at
carne
as
if
to
discover
whether
or
not
he
was
laughing
at
him
carne
s
face
however
was
quite
expressionless
i
suppose
you
won
t
be
at
the
wilbringham
s
i
m
afraid
not
you
evidently
forget
that
as
i
said
just
now
i
have
a
very
good
and
sufficient
excuse
when
the
front
door
had
closed
behind
his
guest
carne
lit
a
third
cigar
i
m
overstepping
my
allowance
he
said
reflectively
as
he
watched
the
smoke
circle
upward
but
it
isn
t
every
day
a
man
gives
a
thousand
pounds
for
a
wedding
present
and
gets
upwards
of
seventy
thousand
back
i
think
i
may
congratulate
myself
on
having
brought
off
a
very
successful
little
speculation
vii
man
of
many
crimes
if
one
consults
a
dictionary
one
finds
that
the
word
dipsomaniac
means
a
man
who
spends
his
life
continually
desiring
alcoholic
liquor
a
name
that
properly
classifies
it
has
not
yet
been
invented
for
the
individual
who
exhibits
a
perpetual
craving
for
notoriety
and
yet
one
is
perhaps
as
much
a
nuisance
to
society
as
the
other
after
his
run
of
success
there
came
a
time
when
simon
carne
like
alexander
the
great
could
have
sat
down
and
wept
for
the
reason
that
he
had
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
for
the
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
exhausted
to
put
it
plainly
every
species
of
artistic
villainy
he
had
won
the
derby
under
peculiar
circumstances
as
narrated
elsewhere
he
had
rendered
a
signal
though
an
unostentatious
service
to
the
state
he
had
stolen
under
enormous
difficulty
the
most
famous
family
jewels
in
europe
and
he
had
relieved
the
most
fashionable
bride
and
bridegroom
of
the
season
of
the
valuable
presents
that
their
friends
and
relations
had
lavished
on
them
on
a
morning
following
a
banquet
at
the
mansion
house
at
which
he
had
been
a
welcome
as
well
as
a
conspicuous
guest
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
study
smoking
a
meditative
cigar
though
the
world
would
scarcely
have
thought
it
a
fashionable
life
did
not
suit
him
and
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
whether
he
was
not
after
all
a
little
tired
of
england
he
was
hungering
for
the
warmth
and
color
of
the
east
and
perhaps
if
the
truth
must
be
told
for
something
of
the
rest
he
had
known
in
the
maharajah
of
kadir
s
lake
palace
where
he
had
been
domiciled
when
he
had
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
man
who
had
been
his
sponsor
in
english
society
the
earl
of
amberley
it
was
a
strange
coincidence
that
while
he
was
thinking
of
that
nobleman
and
of
the
events
which
had
followed
the
introduction
just
referred
to
his
quick
ears
should
have
caught
the
sound
of
a
bell
that
was
destined
eventually
to
lead
him
up
to
one
of
the
most
sensational
adventures
of
all
his
sensational
career
a
moment
later
his
butler
entered
to
inform
him
that
lady
caroline
weltershall
and
the
earl
of
amberley
had
called
and
would
like
to
see
him
tossing
his
cigar
into
the
grate
he
passed
through
the
door
ram
gafur
held
open
for
him
and
having
crossed
the
hall
entered
the
as
he
went
he
wondered
what
it
was
that
had
brought
them
to
see
him
at
such
an
early
hour
both
were
among
his
more
intimate
acquaintances
and
both
occupied
distinguished
positions
in
the
social
life
of
the
world
s
great
metropolis
while
her
friends
and
relations
spent
their
time
in
search
of
amusement
and
a
seemingly
eternal
round
of
gaieties
which
involved
a
waste
of
both
health
and
money
lady
caroline
who
was
the
ugly
duckling
of
an
otherwise
singularly
handsome
family
put
her
life
to
a
different
use
philanthropy
was
her
hobby
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
in
which
she
did
not
speak
at
some
meeting
preside
over
some
committee
or
endeavor
in
some
way
as
she
somewhat
grandiloquently
put
it
to
better
the
lives
and
ameliorate
the
conditions
of
our
less
fortunate
in
appearance
she
was
a
short
fair
woman
of
about
years
of
age
with
a
not
unhandsome
face
the
effect
of
which
however
was
completely
spoilt
by
two
large
and
protruding
teeth
my
dear
lady
caroline
this
is
indeed
kind
of
you
said
carne
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
also
of
you
lord
amberley
to
what
happy
circumstance
may
i
attribute
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
i
fear
it
is
dreadfully
early
for
us
to
come
to
see
you
replied
her
ladyship
but
lord
amberley
assured
me
that
as
our
business
is
so
pressing
you
would
forgive
us
pray
do
not
apologize
returned
carne
it
gives
me
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
to
see
you
as
for
the
hour
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
while
the
morning
is
no
longer
young
i
have
only
just
finished
breakfast
but
won
t
you
sit
down
they
seated
themselves
once
more
and
when
they
had
done
so
lady
caroline
unfolded
her
tale
as
you
are
perhaps
aware
my
friends
say
that
i
never
come
to
see
them
unless
it
is
to
attempt
to
extort
money
from
them
for
some
charitable
purpose
she
said
no
you
need
not
prepare
to
button
up
your
pockets
carne
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
for
anything
what
i
want
however
is
to
endeavor
to
persuade
you
to
help
us
in
a
movement
we
are
inaugurating
to
raise
money
with
which
to
relieve
the
great
distress
in
the
canary
islands
brought
about
by
the
late
disastrous
earthquake
my
cousin
the
marquis
of
laverstock
has
kindly
promised
to
act
as
president
and
although
we
started
it
but
yesterday
ten
thousand
pounds
have
already
been
subscribed
as
you
are
aware
however
if
we
are
to
attract
public
attention
and
support
the
funds
raised
must
be
representative
of
all
classes
our
intention
therefore
is
to
hold
a
meeting
at
my
house
afternoon
when
a
number
of
the
most
prominent
people
of
the
day
will
be
invited
to
give
us
their
views
upon
the
subject
i
feel
sure
if
you
will
only
consent
to
throw
in
your
lot
with
us
and
to
assist
in
carrying
out
what
we
have
in
view
we
shall
be
able
to
raise
a
sum
of
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
our
kind
friend
here
lord
amberley
has
promised
to
act
as
secretary
and
his
efforts
will
be
invaluable
to
us
royalty
has
signified
its
gracious
approval
and
it
is
expected
will
head
the
list
with
a
handsome
donation
every
class
will
be
appealed
to
ministers
of
religion
of
all
known
denominations
will
be
invited
to
and
if
you
will
only
consent
to
allow
your
name
to
appear
upon
the
personnel
of
the
committee
and
will
allow
us
to
advertise
your
name
as
a
speaker
at
s
meeting
i
feel
sure
there
is
nothing
we
shall
not
be
able
to
achieve
i
shall
be
delighted
to
help
you
in
any
way
i
can
carne
replied
if
my
name
is
likely
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
i
beg
you
will
make
use
of
it
in
the
meantime
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
forward
you
a
cheque
for
one
thousand
pounds
being
my
contribution
to
the
fund
you
have
so
charitably
started
her
ladyship
beamed
with
delight
and
even
lord
amberley
smiled
gracious
approval
you
are
generous
indeed
said
lady
caroline
i
only
wish
others
would
imitate
your
example
she
did
not
say
that
wealthy
though
she
herself
was
she
had
only
contributed
ten
pounds
to
the
fund
it
is
well
known
that
while
she
inaugurated
large
works
of
charity
she
seldom
contributed
very
largely
to
them
as
a
wit
once
remarked
philanthropy
was
her
virtue
and
meanness
was
her
vice
egad
said
amberley
if
you
re
going
to
open
your
like
that
carne
i
shall
feel
called
upon
to
do
the
same
then
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
booking
both
amounts
at
once
cried
her
ladyship
at
the
same
time
whipping
out
her
and
pencil
with
flattering
alacrity
i
shall
be
delighted
said
carne
with
a
smile
of
eagerness
i
also
replied
amberley
and
in
a
trice
both
amounts
were
written
down
having
gained
her
point
her
ladyship
rose
to
say
lord
amberley
immediately
imitated
her
example
you
will
not
forget
will
you
mr
carne
she
said
i
am
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
my
house
afternoon
at
three
o
clock
we
shall
look
forward
to
hearing
your
speech
and
i
need
not
remind
you
that
every
word
you
utter
will
be
listened
to
with
the
closest
attention
at
three
afternoon
said
carne
i
shall
be
at
your
house
you
need
have
no
fear
that
i
shall
forget
and
now
since
you
think
you
must
be
going
and
many
thanks
to
you
for
asking
me
he
escorted
them
to
the
carriage
which
was
waiting
outside
and
when
he
had
watched
it
drive
away
returned
to
his
study
to
write
the
cheque
he
had
promised
her
having
done
so
he
did
not
rise
from
his
chair
but
continued
to
sit
at
his
biting
the
feather
of
his
quill
pen
and
staring
at
the
blotting
pad
before
him
a
great
and
glorious
notion
had
suddenly
come
into
his
head
and
the
majesty
of
it
was
for
the
moment
holding
him
spellbound
if
only
it
could
be
worked
he
said
to
himself
what
a
glorious
it
would
be
the
question
for
my
consideration
is
can
it
be
done
to
invite
the
people
of
england
to
subscribe
its
pounds
shillings
and
pence
for
my
benefit
would
be
a
glorious
notion
and
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
should
enjoy
besides
which
i
have
to
remember
that
i
am
a
thousand
pounds
to
the
bad
already
and
that
must
come
back
from
somewhere
for
the
present
however
i
ll
put
the
matter
aside
after
the
meeting
i
shall
have
something
tangible
to
go
upon
and
then
if
i
still
feel
in
the
same
mind
it
will
be
strange
if
i
can
t
find
some
way
of
doing
what
i
want
in
the
meantime
i
shall
have
to
think
out
my
speech
upon
that
will
depend
a
good
deal
of
my
success
it
is
a
strange
world
in
which
it
is
ordained
that
so
much
should
depend
upon
so
little
at
five
minutes
to
three
o
clock
on
the
following
afternoon
simon
carne
might
have
been
observed
that
i
believe
is
the
correct
expression
strolling
across
from
apsley
house
to
gloucester
place
reaching
lord
weltershall
s
residence
he
discovered
a
long
row
of
carriages
lining
the
pavement
and
setting
down
their
occupants
at
his
lordship
s
door
carne
followed
the
stream
into
the
house
and
was
carried
by
it
up
the
stairs
towards
the
large
where
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
already
about
a
hundred
persons
were
present
and
it
was
evident
that
if
they
continued
to
arrive
at
the
same
rate
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
room
would
be
filled
to
overflowing
seeing
lady
caroline
bidding
her
friends
welcome
near
the
door
carne
hastened
to
shake
hands
with
her
it
is
so
very
good
of
you
to
come
she
said
as
she
took
his
hand
remember
we
are
looking
to
you
for
a
rousing
speech
this
afternoon
we
want
one
that
will
inflame
all
england
and
touch
the
heartstrings
of
every
man
and
woman
in
the
land
to
touch
their
would
perhaps
be
more
to
the
point
said
carne
with
one
of
his
quiet
smiles
let
us
hope
we
shall
touch
them
too
she
replied
now
would
you
mind
going
to
the
dais
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
you
will
find
lord
laverstock
there
talking
to
my
husband
i
think
carne
bowed
and
went
forward
as
he
had
been
directed
so
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
celebrities
had
arrived
the
meeting
was
declared
open
and
the
commenced
clever
as
some
of
them
were
it
could
not
be
doubted
that
carne
s
address
was
the
event
of
the
afternoon
he
was
a
born
speaker
and
what
was
more
despite
the
short
notice
he
had
received
had
made
himself
thoroughly
conversant
with
his
subject
his
handsome
face
was
on
fire
with
excitement
and
his
sonorous
voice
rang
through
the
large
room
like
a
trumpet
call
when
he
sat
down
it
was
amidst
a
burst
of
applause
lord
laverstock
leant
forward
and
shook
hands
with
him
your
speech
will
be
read
all
over
england
morning
he
said
it
should
make
a
difference
of
thousands
of
pounds
to
the
fund
i
congratulate
you
most
heartily
upon
it
simon
carne
felt
that
if
it
was
really
going
to
make
that
difference
he
might
in
the
light
of
future
events
heartily
congratulate
himself
he
however
accepted
the
praise
showered
upon
him
with
becoming
modesty
and
during
the
next
speaker
s
exhibition
of
halting
elocution
amused
himself
watching
the
faces
before
him
and
speculating
as
to
what
they
would
say
when
the
surprise
he
was
going
to
spring
upon
them
became
known
later
when
the
committee
had
been
elected
and
the
meeting
had
broken
up
he
bade
his
friends
and
set
off
on
his
return
home
that
evening
he
was
dining
at
home
intending
to
call
at
his
club
afterwards
and
to
drop
in
at
a
reception
and
two
dances
between
ten
and
midnight
after
dinner
however
he
changed
his
mind
and
having
instructed
ram
gafur
to
deny
him
to
all
callers
and
countermanding
his
order
for
his
carriage
went
to
his
study
where
he
locked
himself
in
and
sat
down
to
smoke
and
think
he
had
set
himself
a
puzzle
which
would
have
taxed
the
brain
of
that
arch
schemer
machiavelli
himself
he
was
not
however
going
to
be
beaten
by
it
there
must
be
some
way
he
told
himself
in
which
the
fraud
could
be
worked
and
if
there
was
he
was
going
to
find
it
numberless
were
the
plans
he
formed
only
to
discover
a
few
moments
later
that
some
little
difficulty
rendered
each
impracticable
suddenly
throwing
down
the
pencil
with
which
he
had
been
writing
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
eagerly
to
pace
the
room
it
was
evident
from
the
expression
upon
his
face
that
he
had
touched
upon
a
train
of
thought
that
was
at
last
likely
to
prove
productive
reaching
the
fireplace
for
about
the
thirtieth
time
he
paused
and
gazed
into
the
fireless
grate
after
standing
there
for
a
few
moments
he
turned
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
said
solemnly
to
himself
yes
i
think
it
can
be
done
whatever
the
train
of
thought
may
have
been
that
led
him
to
make
this
declaration
it
was
plain
that
it
afforded
him
no
small
amount
of
satisfaction
he
did
not
however
commit
himself
at
once
to
a
decision
but
continued
to
think
over
the
scheme
he
had
hit
upon
until
he
had
completely
mastered
it
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
he
was
thoroughly
satisfied
then
he
followed
his
invariable
practice
on
such
occasions
and
rang
for
the
inimitable
belton
when
he
had
admitted
him
to
the
room
he
bade
him
close
and
lock
the
door
behind
him
by
the
time
this
had
been
done
he
had
lit
a
fresh
cigar
and
had
once
more
taken
up
his
position
on
the
hearthrug
i
sent
for
you
to
say
that
i
have
just
made
up
my
mind
to
try
a
little
scheme
compared
with
which
all
i
have
done
so
far
will
sink
into
insignificance
what
is
it
sir
asked
belton
i
will
tell
you
but
you
must
not
look
so
terrified
put
in
a
few
words
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
to
attempt
to
divert
the
enormous
sums
of
money
which
the
prodigal
english
public
is
taking
out
of
its
pocket
in
order
to
assist
the
people
of
the
canary
islands
who
have
lost
so
severely
by
the
recent
terrible
earthquake
into
my
own
belton
s
face
expressed
his
astonishment
but
my
dear
sir
he
said
that
s
a
fund
of
which
the
marquis
of
laverstock
is
president
and
of
whose
committee
you
are
one
of
the
principal
members
exactly
answered
carne
it
is
to
those
two
happy
circumstances
i
shall
later
on
attribute
the
success
i
now
mean
to
attain
lord
laverstock
is
merely
a
pompous
old
nobleman
whose
hobby
is
philanthropy
this
lesson
will
do
him
good
it
will
be
strange
if
before
i
am
a
week
older
i
can
not
twist
him
round
my
finger
now
for
my
instructions
in
the
first
place
you
must
find
me
a
house
fit
for
an
elderly
lady
and
situated
in
a
fairly
fashionable
quarter
say
south
kensington
furnish
it
on
the
hire
system
from
one
of
the
big
firms
and
engage
three
servants
who
can
be
relied
upon
to
do
their
work
and
what
is
more
important
who
can
hold
their
tongues
next
find
me
an
old
lady
to
impersonate
the
mistress
of
the
house
she
must
be
very
frail
and
and
you
will
arrange
with
some
livery
stable
people
in
the
neighborhood
to
supply
her
with
a
carriage
in
which
she
will
go
for
an
airing
every
afternoon
in
order
that
the
neighborhood
may
become
familiar
with
her
personality
both
she
and
the
servants
must
be
made
to
thoroughly
understand
that
their
only
chance
of
obtaining
anything
from
me
depends
upon
their
carrying
out
my
instructions
to
the
letter
also
while
they
are
in
the
house
they
must
keep
themselves
to
themselves
my
identity
of
course
must
not
transpire
as
soon
as
i
give
the
signal
the
old
lady
must
keep
to
the
house
and
the
neighborhood
must
be
allowed
to
understand
that
she
is
seriously
ill
the
day
following
she
will
be
worse
and
the
next
she
will
be
dead
you
will
then
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
order
a
coffin
and
arrange
for
the
conveyance
of
the
body
to
southampton
for
the
channel
islands
where
she
is
to
be
buried
at
southampton
a
yacht
which
i
will
arrange
for
myself
will
be
in
readiness
to
carry
us
out
to
sea
do
you
think
you
understand
perfectly
sir
belton
replied
but
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
give
up
the
attempt
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
sir
i
hope
but
it
does
seem
to
me
a
pity
when
you
have
done
so
much
to
risk
losing
it
all
over
such
a
dangerous
bit
of
business
as
this
it
surely
can
t
succeed
sir
belton
said
carne
very
seriously
you
strike
me
as
being
in
a
strange
humor
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
like
it
were
it
not
that
i
have
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
you
i
should
begin
to
think
you
were
turning
honest
in
that
case
our
connection
would
be
likely
to
be
a
very
short
one
i
hope
sir
belton
answered
in
alarm
that
you
still
believe
i
am
as
devoted
as
ever
to
your
interests
i
do
believe
it
carne
replied
let
the
manner
in
which
you
carry
out
the
various
instructions
i
have
just
given
you
confirm
me
in
that
belief
this
is
wednesday
i
shall
expect
you
to
come
to
me
on
saturday
with
a
report
that
the
house
has
been
taken
and
furnished
and
that
the
servants
are
installed
and
the
delicate
old
lady
in
residence
you
may
rely
upon
my
doing
my
best
sir
i
feel
sure
of
that
said
carne
and
now
that
all
is
arranged
i
think
i
will
go
to
bed
a
week
later
a
committee
of
the
canary
island
relief
fund
was
able
to
announce
to
the
world
through
the
columns
of
the
daily
press
that
the
generous
public
of
england
had
subscribed
no
less
a
sum
than
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
by
the
late
earthquake
the
same
day
carne
attended
a
committee
meeting
in
gloucester
place
a
proposition
advanced
by
lady
weltershall
and
seconded
by
simon
carne
was
carried
unanimously
it
was
to
the
effect
that
in
a
week
s
time
such
members
of
the
relief
committee
as
could
get
away
should
start
for
the
scene
of
the
calamity
in
the
chairman
s
yacht
which
had
been
placed
at
their
disposal
taking
with
them
for
distribution
among
the
impoverished
inhabitants
of
the
islands
the
sum
already
subscribed
namely
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
english
gold
they
would
then
be
able
with
the
assistance
of
the
english
consul
to
personally
superintend
the
distribution
of
their
money
and
also
be
in
a
position
to
report
to
the
subscribers
when
they
returned
to
england
the
manner
in
which
the
money
had
been
utilized
in
that
case
said
carne
who
had
not
only
seconded
the
motion
but
had
put
the
notion
into
lady
weltershall
s
head
it
might
be
as
well
if
our
chairman
would
interview
the
authorities
of
the
bank
and
arrange
that
the
amount
in
question
shall
be
packed
ready
for
delivery
to
the
messengers
he
may
select
to
call
for
it
before
the
date
in
question
i
will
make
it
my
business
to
call
at
the
bank
morning
replied
the
chairman
and
perhaps
you
carne
would
have
no
objection
to
accompany
me
if
it
will
facilitate
the
business
of
this
committee
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
to
do
so
said
carne
and
so
it
was
settled
on
a
tuesday
afternoon
six
days
later
and
two
days
before
the
date
upon
which
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
committee
should
sail
the
marquis
of
laverstock
received
a
letter
lady
caroline
weltershall
the
earl
of
amberley
and
simon
carne
were
with
him
when
he
opened
it
he
read
it
through
and
then
read
it
again
after
which
he
turned
to
his
guests
this
is
really
a
very
extraordinary
communication
he
said
and
it
affects
the
matter
we
have
most
at
heart
perhaps
i
had
better
read
it
to
you
great
chesterton
street
to
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
laverstock
berkeley
square
my
lord
as
one
who
has
been
permitted
to
enjoy
a
long
and
peaceful
life
in
a
country
where
such
visitations
are
happily
unknown
i
take
the
liberty
of
writing
to
your
lordship
to
say
how
very
much
i
should
like
to
subscribe
to
the
fund
so
nobly
started
by
you
and
your
friends
to
assist
the
poor
people
who
have
lost
so
much
by
the
earthquake
in
the
canary
islands
being
a
lonely
old
woman
blessed
by
providence
with
some
small
share
of
worldly
wealth
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
make
some
small
sacrifice
to
help
others
who
have
not
been
so
blessed
unfortunately
i
do
not
enjoy
very
good
health
but
if
your
lordship
could
spare
a
moment
to
call
upon
me
i
would
like
to
thank
you
in
the
name
of
womanhood
for
all
you
have
done
and
in
proof
of
my
gratitude
would
willingly
give
you
my
cheque
for
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
to
add
to
the
amount
already
subscribed
i
am
permitted
by
my
doctors
to
see
visitors
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
twelve
in
the
morning
and
five
and
six
in
the
afternoon
i
should
then
be
both
honored
and
pleased
to
see
your
lordship
trusting
you
will
concede
me
this
small
favor
i
have
the
honor
to
be
yours
very
sincerely
janet
o
halloran
there
was
a
momentary
pause
after
his
lordship
had
finished
reading
the
letter
what
will
you
do
inquired
lady
caroline
it
is
a
noble
offering
put
in
simon
carne
i
think
there
can
not
be
two
opinions
as
to
what
is
my
duty
replied
the
chairman
i
shall
accede
to
her
request
though
why
she
wants
to
see
me
is
more
than
i
can
tell
as
she
hints
in
the
letter
she
wishes
to
congratulate
you
personally
on
what
you
have
done
continued
the
earl
of
amberley
and
as
it
will
be
the
handsomest
donation
we
have
yet
received
it
will
perhaps
be
as
well
to
humor
her
in
that
case
i
will
do
as
i
say
and
make
it
my
business
to
call
there
this
afternoon
between
five
and
six
and
now
it
is
my
duty
to
report
to
you
that
simon
carne
and
i
waited
upon
the
authorities
at
the
bank
this
morning
and
have
arranged
that
the
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
gold
shall
be
ready
for
our
messengers
when
they
call
for
it
either
morning
or
afternoon
at
latest
it
is
a
large
sum
to
take
with
us
said
lady
caroline
i
trust
it
will
not
prove
a
temptation
to
thieves
you
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
replied
his
lordship
as
i
have
explained
to
the
manager
my
own
trusted
servants
will
effect
the
removal
of
the
money
accompanied
by
two
private
detectives
who
will
remain
on
board
my
yacht
until
we
weigh
anchor
we
have
left
nothing
to
chance
to
make
the
matter
doubly
sure
i
have
also
arranged
that
the

shall
not

to
a
person
who
shall
present
my
cheque
and
at
the
same
time
show
this
signet
ring
which
i
now
wear
upon
my
finger
the
other
members
of
the
committee
expressed
themselves
as
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
arrangement
and
when
certain
other
business
had
been
transacted
the
meeting
broke
up
as
soon
as
he
left
berkeley
square
carne
returned
with
all
haste
to
porchester
house
reaching
his
study
he
ordered
that
belton
should
be
at
once
sent
to
him

said
when
the
latter
stood
before
him

moment

great
chesterton
street

two
hours

seven
o
clock
to

a
funeral
party

of

and

may
say
that
the
amount
of

it

be

be
paid
before

train
starts
as
soon
as
you

you
understand
what
you
have
to
do
perfectly
sir
belton
replied
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
very
nervous
there
is
no
need
to
be
mark
my
words
everything
will
go
like
clockwork
now
i
am
going
to
change
my
things
and
prepare
for
the
excursion
he
would
have
been
a
sharp
man
who
would
have
recognized
in
the
clergyman
who
drove
up
in
a
hansom
to
great
chesterton
street
later
simon
carne
who
had
attended
the
committee
meeting
of
the
canary
island
relief
fund
that
afternoon
as
he
alighted
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
all
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
and
that
there
were
evident
signs
that
death
had
laid
his
finger
on
the
house
having
dismissed
his
cab
he
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
door
was
opened
entered
the
house
the
butler
who
admitted
him
had
been
prepared
for
coming
he
bowed
respectfully
and
conducted
him
into
the
there
he
found
an
intensely
respectable
lady
attired
in
black
silk
seated
beside
the
window
go
upstairs
he
said
peremptorily
and
remain
in
the
room
above
this
until
you
are
told
to
come
down
be
careful
not
to
let
yourself
be
seen
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
you
can
leave
the
house
but
not
till
then
before
you
go
the
money
promised
you
will
be
paid
now
be
off
upstairs
and
make
sure
that
some
of
the
neighbors
catch
sight
of
you
ten
minutes
later
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
retired
military
officer
and
who
was
dressed
in
the
deepest
black
drove
up
and
was
admitted
to
the
house
though
no
one
would
have
recognized
him
carne
addressed
him
at
once
as
belton
what
have
you
arranged
about
the
train
he
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
together
i
have
settled
that
it
shall
be
ready
to
start
for
southampton
punctually
at
seven
o
clock
the
other
answered
and
what
about
the
hearse
it
will
be
here
at
a
quarter
to
seven
without
fail
very
good
we
will
have
the
corpse
ready
meanwhile
now
before
you
do
anything
else
have
the
two
lower
blinds
in
the
front
room
drawn
up
if
he
thinks
there
is
trouble
in
the
house
he
may
take
fright
and
we
must
not
scare
our
bird
away
after
all
the
bother
we
have
had
to
lure
him
here
for
the
next
hour
they
were
busily
engaged
perfecting
their
arrangements
these
were
scarcely
completed
before
a
gorgeous
landau
drove
up
to
the
house
and
belton
reported
that
the
footman
had
alighted
and
was
ascending
the
steps
let
his
lordship
be
shown
into
the
said
simon
carne
and
as
soon
as
he
is
there
do
you
belton
wait
at
the
door
i
ll
call
you
when
i
want
you
carne
went
into
the
and
set
the
door
ajar
as
he
did
so
he
heard
the
footman
inquire
whether
o
halloran
was
at
home
and
whether
she
would
see
his
master
the
butler
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
a
few
moments
later
the
marquis
ascended
the
steps
will
you
be
pleased
to
step
this
way
my
lord
said
the
servant
my
mistress
is
expecting
you
and
will
see
you
at
once
when
he
entered
the
he
discovered
the
same
portly
dignified
clergyman
whom
the
neighbors
had
seen
enter
the
house
an
hour
or
so
before
standing
before
the
fireplace
my
lord
said
this
individual
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
butler
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
take
a
seat
o
halloran
will
be
down
in
a
few
moments
his
lordship
did
as
he
was
requested
and
while
doing
so
commented
on
the
weather
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
wander
round
the
room
he
took
in
the
grand
piano
the
easy
chairs
on
either
side
of
the
and
the
in
the
window
he
could
see
that
there
was
plain
evidence
of
wealth
in
these
things
what
his
next
thought
would
have
been
can
only
be
conjectured
for
he
was
suddenly
roused
from
his
reverie
by
hearing
the
man
say
in
a
gruff
voice
it
s
all
up
my
lord
if
you
move
or
attempt
to
cry
out
you
re
a
dead
man
swinging
round
he
discovered
a
revolver
barrel
pointed
at
his
head
he
uttered
an
involuntary
cry
of
alarm
and
made
as
if
he
would
rise
sit
down
sir
said
the
clergyman
authoritatively
are
you
mad
that
you
disobey
me
you
do
not
know
with
whom
you
are
trifling
what
do
you
mean
cried
the
astonished
peer
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
i
demand
to
be
told
what
this
behavior
means
are
you
aware
who
i
am
perfectly
the
other
replied
as
to
your
other
question
you
will
know
nothing
more
than
i
choose
to
tell
you
what
s
more
i
should
advise
you
to
hold
your
tongue
unless
you
desire
to
be
gagged
that
would
be
unpleasant
for
all
parties
then
turning
to
the
door
he
cried
come
in
dick
a
moment
later
the
military
individual
who
had
been
to
waterloo
to
arrange
about
the
train
entered
the
room
to
find
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
laverstock
seated
in
an
easy
chair
almost
beside
himself
with
terror
with
the
venerable
clergyman
standing
over
him
revolver
in
hand
dick
my
lad
said
the
latter
quietly
his
lordship
has
been
wise
enough
to
hear
reason
no
sir
thank
you
your
hands
behind
your
back
as
arranged
if
you
please
if
you
don
t
obey
me
i
shall
blow
your
brains
out
and
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
spoil
this
nice
turkey
carpet
that
s
right
now
dick
my
lad
i
want
his
lordship
s
from
his
coat
and
those
sheets
of
and
envelopes
we
brought
with
us
i
carry
a
stylographic
pen
myself
so
there
is
no
need
of
ink
these
articles
having
been
obtained
they
were
placed
on
a
table
beside
him
and
carne
took
possession
of
the
he
leisurely
opened
it
and
from
it
took
the
cheque
for
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
signed
by
the
chairman
and
committee
of
the
canary
island
relief
fund
which
had
been
drawn
that
afternoon
now
take
the
pen
he
said
and
begin
to
write
endeavor
to
remember
that
i
am
in
a
hurry
and
have
no
time
to
waste
let
the
first
letter
be
to
the
bank
authorities
request
them
in
your
capacity
of
chairman
of
the
relief
fund
to
hand
to
the
bearers
the
amount
of
the
cheque
in
gold
i
will
do
no
such
thing
cried
the
old
fellow
sturdily
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
assist
you
in
perpetrating
such
a
fraud
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
said
carne
sweetly
for
i
am
afraid
in
that
case
we
shall
be
compelled
to
make
you
submit
to
a
rather
unpleasant
alternative
come
sir
i
will
give
you
three
minutes
in
which
to
write
that
letter
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
have
not
done
so
i
shall
proceed
to
drastic
measures
so
saying
he
thrust
the
poker
into
the
fire
in
a
highly
suggestive
manner
needless
to
say
within
the
time
specified
the
letter
had
been
written
placed
in
its
envelope
and
directed
now
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
to
fill
in
this
telegraph
form
to
your
wife
to
tell
her
that
you
have
been
called
out
of
town
and
do
not
expect
to
be
able
to
return
until
the
other
wrote
as
directed
and
when
he
had
done
so
carne
placed
this
paper
also
in
his
pocket
now
i
want
that
signet
ring
upon
your
finger
if
you
please
the
old
gentleman
handed
it
over
to
his
persecutor
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
had
realized
that
it
was
useless
to
refuse
now
that
on
the
sideboard
dick
said
the
clergyman
also
that
carafe
of
water
when
you
have
given
them
to
me
go
and
see
that
the
others
things
i
spoke
to
you
about
are
ready
having
placed
the
articles
in
question
upon
the
table
belton
left
the
room
carne
immediately
filled
the
glass
into
which
he
poured
about
a
tablespoonful
of
some
dark
liquid
from
a
bottle
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
and
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
that
purpose
i
ll
have
to
trouble
you
to
drink
this
my
lord
he
said
as
he
stirred
the
contents
of
the
glass
with
an
ivory
paper
knife
taken
from
the
table
you
need
have
no
fear
it
is
perfectly
harmless
and
will
not
hurt
you
i
will
not
touch
it
replied
the
other
nothing
you
can
do
or
say
will
induce
me
to
drink
a
drop
of
it
carne
examined
his
watch
ostentatiously
time
flies
i
regret
to
say
he
answered
impressively
and
i
can
not
stay
to
argue
the
question
with
you
i
will
give
you
three
minutes
to
do
as
i
have
ordered
you
if
you
have
not
drunk
it
by
that
time
we
shall
be
compelled
to
repeat
the
little
persuasion
we
tried
with
such
success
a
few
moments
since
you
wish
to
kill
me
cried
the
other
i
will
not
drink
it
i
will
not
be
murdered
you
are
a
fiend
to
attempt
such
a
thing
i
regret
to
say
you
are
wasting
time
replied
his
companion
i
assure
you
if
you
drink
it
you
will
not
be
hurt
it
is
merely
an
opiate
intended
to
put
you
to
sleep
until
we
have
time
to
get
away
in
safety
come
that
delightful
poker
is
getting
hot
again
and
if
you
do
not
do
what
i
tell
you
trouble
will
ensue
think
well
before
you
refuse
there
was
another
pause
during
which
the
unfortunate
nobleman
gazed
first
at
the
poker
which
had
been
thrust
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
and
then
at
the
relentless
being
who
stood
before
him
revolver
in
hand
never
had
a
member
of
the
house
of
lords
been
placed
in
a
more
awkward
and
unenviable
position
one
minute
said
carne
quietly
there
was
another
pause
during
which
the
marquis
groaned
in
a
heartrending
manner
carne
remembered
with
a
smile
that
the
family
title
had
been
bestowed
upon
one
of
the
marquis
ancestors
for
bravery
on
the
field
of
battle
two
minutes
as
he
spoke
he
stooped
and
gave
the
poker
a
little
twist
three
minutes
the
words
were
scarce
out
of
his
mouth
before
lord
laverstock
threw
up
his
hands
you
are
a
heartless
being
to
make
me
but
i
will
drink
he
cried
and
with
an
ashened
face
he
immediately
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
glass
thank
you
said
carne
politely
the
effect
produced
by
the
drug
was
almost
instantaneous
a
man
could
scarcely
have
counted
a
hundred
before
the
old
gentleman
who
had
evidently
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
laid
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
was
fast
asleep
he
has
succumbed
even
quicker
than
i
expected
said
carne
to
himself
as
he
bent
over
the
prostrate
figure
and
listened
to
his
even
breathing
it
is
perhaps
just
as
well
that
this
drug
is
not
known
in
england
at
any
rate
on
this
occasion
it
has
answered
my
purpose
most
admirably
at
five
minutes
before
seven
o
clock
a
hearse
containing
the
mortal
remains
of
o
halloran
of
great
chesterton
street
south
kensington
entered
the
yard
of
waterloo
station
accompanied
by
a
hansom
cab
a
special
train
was
in
waiting
to
convey
the
party
which
consisted
of
the
deceased
s
brother
a
retired
indian
officer
and
her
cousin
the
vicar
of
a
somersetshire
parish
to
southampton
where
a
steam
yacht
would
transport
them
to
guernsey
in
which
place
the
remains
were
to
be
interred
beside
those
of
her
late
husband
i
think
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
belton
on
having
carried
it
out
most
successfully
said
carne
when
the
coffin
had
been
carried
on
board
the
yacht
and
placed
in
the
saloon
as
soon
as
we
are
under
weigh
we
ll
have
this
lid
off
and
get
the
poor
old
gentleman
out
he
has
had
a
good
spell
of
it
in
there
but
he
may
congratulate
himself
that
the
ventilating
arrangements
of
his
temporary
home
were
so
perfectly
attended
to
otherwise
i
should
have
trembled
for
the
result
a
few
hours
later
having
helped
his
guest
to
recover
consciousness
and
having
seen
him
safely
locked
up
in
a
cabin
on
board
the
yacht
put
in
at
a
little
town
some
thirty
or
forty
miles
from
southampton
water
and
landed
two
men
in
time
to
catch
the
midnight
express
to
london
the
following
afternoon
they
rejoined
the
yacht
a
hundred
miles
or
so
further
down
the
coast
when
they
were
once
more
out
at
sea
carne
called
the
skipper
to
his
cabin
how
has
your
prisoner
conducted
himself
during
our
absence
he
asked
has
he
given
any
trouble
not
a
bit
replied
the
man
the
poor
old
buffer
s
been
too
sick
to
make
a
row
he
sent
away
his
breakfast
and
his
lunch
untouched
the
only
thing
he
seems
to
care
about
is
champagne
and
that
he
drinks
by
the
i
never
saw
a
better
man
at
his
bottle
in
all
my
life
it
was
well
after
ten
o
clock
that
evening
when
simon
carne
still
attired
as
a
respectable
church
of
england
clergyman
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
his
prisoner
s
cabin
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
my
lord
he
said
that
your
term
of
imprisonment
has
at
last
come
to
an
end
you
had
better
get
up
and
dress
for
a
boat
will
be
alongside
in
twenty
minutes
to
take
you
ashore
the
unfortunate
gentleman
needed
no
second
bidding
ill
as
he
had
hitherto
been
he
seemed
to
derive
new
life
from
the
other
s
words
at
any
rate
he
sprang
out
of
his
bunk
and
set
to
work
to
dress
with
feverish
energy
all
the
time
carne
sat
and
watched
him
with
an
amused
smile
upon
his
face
so
soon
as
he
was
ready
and
the
captain
had
knocked
at
the
door
he
was
conducted
to
the
deck
and
ordered
to
descend
into
a
shore
boat
which
had
come
off
in
answer
to
a
signal
and
was
now
lying
alongside
in
readiness
carne
and
belton
leant
over
the
bulwarks
to
watch
him
depart
my
lord
cried
the
former
as
the
boat
moved
away
it
has
been
a
sincere
pleasure
to
me
to
entertain
you
and
i
only
hope
that
in
return
you
have
enjoyed
your
little
excursion
you
might
give
my
respectful
compliments
to
the
members
of
the
canary
island
relief
fund
and
tell
them
that
there
is
at
least
one
person
on
board
this
yacht
who
appreciates
their
kindly
efforts
then
his
lordship
stood
up
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
yacht
until
it
had
faded
away
and
could
no
longer
be
seen
owing
to
the
darkness
presently
carne
turned
to
belton
so
much
for
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
laverstock
he
said
and
the
canary
island
relief
fund
now
let
us
be
off
to
town
i
must
be
simon
carne
once
more
next
morning
simon
carne
arose
from
his
couch
in
his
luxurious
bedroom
a
little
later
than
usual
he
knew
he
should
be
tired
and
had
instructed
belton
not
to
come
in
until
he
rang
his
bell
when
the
latter
appeared
he
bade
him
bring
in
the
morning
papers
he
found
what
he
wanted
in
the
first
he
opened
on
the
middle
page
headed
with
three
lines
of
large
type
gigantic
swindle
the
marquis
of
laverstock
abducted
the
canary
island
fund
stolen
this
looks
quite
interesting
said
carne
as
he
folded
the
paper
in
order
to
be
able
the
better
to
read
the
account
as
i
know
something
of
the
case
i
shall
be
interested
to
see
what
they
have
to
say
about
it
let
me
see
the
newspaper
version
ran
as
follows
of
all
the
series
of
extraordinary
crimes
which
it
has
been
our
unfortunate
duty
to
chronicle
during
this
year
of
great
rejoicing
it
is
doubtful
whether
a
more
impudent
robbery
has
been
perpetrated
than
that
which
we
have
to
place
before
our
readers
this
morning
as
every
one
is
well
aware
a
large
fund
has
been
collected
from
all
classes
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
by
the
recent
canary
island
earthquake
on
the
day
before
the
robbery
took
place
this
fund
amounted
to
no
less
a
sum
than
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
it
was
the
intention
of
the
committee
under
the
presidency
of
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
laverstock
to
proceed
to
the
seat
of
the
disaster
taking
with
them
the
entire
amount
of
the
sum
raised
in
english
gold
unfortunately
for
the
success
of
this
scheme
his
lordship
was
the
recipient
two
days
ago
of
a
letter
from
a
person
purporting
to
reside
in
great
chesterton
street
south
kensington
she
signed
herself
janet
o
halloran
and
offered
to
add
a
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
to
the
amount
already
collected
provided
the
marquis
would
call
and
collect
her
cheque
personally
the
excuse
given
for
this
extraordinary
stipulation
was
that
she
wished
to
convey
to
him
her
thanks
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
accordingly
feeling
that
he
had
no
right
to
allow
such
a
chance
to
slip
his
lordship
visited
the
house
he
was
received
in
the
by
a
man
dressed
in
the
garb
of
a
clergyman
who
assisted
by
a
individual
presently
clapped
a
revolver
to
his
head
and
demanded
under
the
threat
of
all
sorts
of
penalties
that
he
should
give
up
to
him
the
cheque
drawn
upon
the
bank
and
which
it
was
the
marquis
s
intention
to
have
cashed
the
following
morning
not
satisfied
with
this
assurance
he
was
also
made
to
write
an
order
to
the
banking
authorities
authorizing
them
to
pay
over
the
money
to
the
bearer
who
was
a
trusted
agent
while
at
the
same
time
he
was
to
supply
them
with
his
signet
ring
which
as
had
already
been
arranged
would
prove
that
the
messengers
were
genuine
and
what
they
pretended
to
be
next
he
was
ordered
to
drink
a
powerful
opiate
and
after
that
his
lordship
remembers
nothing
more
until
he
awoke
to
find
himself
on
board
a
small
yacht
in
despite
the
agony
he
was
suffering
he
was
detained
on
board
this
piratical
craft
until
late
last
night
when
he
was
set
ashore
at
a
small
village
within
a
few
miles
of
plymouth
such
is
his
lordship
s
story
the
sequel
to
the
picture
is
as
follows
soon
after
the
bank
was
opened
yesterday
a
individual
accompanied
by
three
others
who
were
introduced
to
the
manager
as
private
detectives
put
in
an
appearance
and
presented
the
relief
fund
s
cheque
at
the
counter
in
reply
to
inquiries
the
letter
written
by
the
marquis
was
produced
and
the
signet
ring
shown
never
for
a
moment
doubting
that
these
were
the
messengers
the
bank
had
all
along
been
told
to
expect
the
money
was
handed
over
and
placed
in
a
handsome
private
omnibus
which
was
waiting
outside
it
was
not
until
late
last
night
when
a
telegram
was
received
from
the
marquis
of
laverstock
from
plymouth
that
the
nature
of
the
gigantic
fraud
which
had
been
perpetrated
was
discovered
the
police
authorities
were
immediately
communicated
with
and
the
matter
placed
in
their
hands
unfortunately
however
so
many
hours
had
been
allowed
to
elapse
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
any
clue
that
might
ultimately
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
parties
concerned
in
the
fraud
so
far
the
case
bids
fair
to
rank
with
those
other
mysterious
robberies
which
during
the
last
few
months
have
shocked
and
puzzled
all
england
i
regard
that
as
a
remarkably
able
exposition
of
the
case
said
carne
to
himself
with
a
smile
as
he
laid
the
paper
down
but
what
an
account
the
man
would
be
able
to
write
if
only
he
could
know
what
is
in
my
safe
upstairs
that
afternoon
he
attended
a
committee
meeting
of
the
fund
at
weltershall
house
the
unfortunate
nobleman
whose
unpleasant
experience
had
founded
the
subject
of
this
story
was
present
carne
was
among
the
first
to
offer
him
an
expression
of
sympathy
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
heard
of
a
more
outrageous
case
he
said
i
only
hope
that
the
scoundrels
may
be
soon
brought
to
justice
in
the
meantime
what
about
the
poor
people
we
intended
to
help
asked
lady
weltershall
they
shall
not
lose
replied
lord
laverstock
i
shall
refund
the
entire
amount
myself
no
no
my
lord
that
would
be
manifestly
unfair
said
simon
carne
we
are
all
trustees
of
the
fund
and
what
happened
is
as
much
our
faults
as
yours
if
nine
other
people
will
do
the
same
i
am
prepared
to
contribute
a
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
towards
the
fund
i
will
follow
your
example
said
the
marquis
i
also
continued
lord
amberley
by
nightfall
seven
other
gentleman
had
done
the
same
and
as
simon
carne
said
as
he
totalled
the
amounts
by
this
means
the
canary
islanders
will
not
be
losers
after
all
viii
imperial
finale
of
all
the
functions
that
ornament
the
calendar
of
the
english
social
and
sporting
year
surely
the
lowes
week
may
claim
to
rank
as
one
of
the
greatest
or
at
least
the
most
enjoyable
so
thought
simon
carne
as
he
sat
on
the
deck
of
lord
tremorden
s
yacht
anchored
off
the
mouth
of
the
medina
river
smoking
his
cigarette
and
whispering
soft
nothings
into
the
ear
of
lady
mabel
madderley
the
lady
of
all
others
who
had
won
the
right
to
be
considered
the
beauty
of
the
past
season
it
was
a
perfect
afternoon
and
as
if
to
fill
his
flagon
of
enjoyment
to
the
very
brim
he
had
won
the
queen
s
cup
with
his
yacht
unknown
only
before
small
wonder
therefore
that
he
was
contented
with
his
lot
in
life
and
his
good
fortune
of
that
afternoon
in
particular
the
tiny
harbor
was
crowded
with
shipping
of
all
sorts
shapes
and
sizes
including
the
guardship
his
imperial
majesty
the
emperor
of
westphalia
s
yacht
the
the
english
royal
yachts
steam
yachts
schooners
cutters
and
all
the
various
craft
taking
part
in
england
s
greatest
water
carnival
steam
launches
darted
hither
and
thither
gigs
conveyed
parties
from
vessel
to
vessel
while
ashore
the
little
town
itself
was
alive
with
bunting
and
echoed
to
the
strains
of
almost
continuous
music
surely
you
ought
to
consider
yourself
a
very
happy
man
carne
said
lady
mabel
madderley
with
a
smile
in
reply
to
a
speech
of
the
other
s
you
won
the
derby
in
june
and
you
have
appropriated
the
queen
s
cup
if
such
things
constitute
happiness
i
suppose
i
must
be
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
answered
carne
as
he
took
another
cigarette
from
his
case
and
lit
it
all
the
same
i
am
insatiable
enough
to
desire
still
greater
fortune
when
one
has
set
one
s
heart
upon
winning
something
besides
which
the
derby
and
the
queen
s
cup
are
items
scarcely
worth
considering
one
is
rather
apt
to
feel
that
fortune
has
still
much
to
give
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
quite
grasp
your
meaning
she
said
but
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
that
told
him
that
if
she
did
not
understand
she
could
at
least
make
a
very
good
guess
according
to
the
world
s
reckoning
he
was
quite
the
best
fish
then
swimming
in
the
matrimonial
pond
and
some
people
for
the
past
few
weeks
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
had
hooked
him
it
could
not
be
denied
that
he
had
been
paying
her
unmistakable
attention
of
late
what
answer
he
would
have
vouchsafed
to
her
speech
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
at
that
moment
their
host
came
along
the
deck
towards
them
he
carried
a
note
in
his
hand
i
have
just
received
a
message
to
say
that
his
imperial
majesty
is
going
to
honor
us
with
a
visit
he
said
when
he
reached
them
if
i
mistake
not
that
is
his
launch
coming
towards
us
now
lady
mabel
and
simon
carne
rose
and
accompanied
him
to
the
starboard
bulwarks
a
smart
white
launch
with
the
westphalian
flag
flying
at
her
stern
had
left
the
royal
yacht
and
was
steaming
quickly
towards
them
a
few
minutes
later
it
had
reached
the
companion
ladder
and
lord
tremorden
had
descended
to
welcome
his
royal
guest
when
they
reached
the
deck
together
his
majesty
shook
hands
with
lady
tremorden
and
afterwards
with
lady
mabel
and
simon
carne
i
must
congratulate
you
most
heartily
carne
he
said
on
your
victory
you
gave
us
an
excellent
race
and
though
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
beaten
by
thirty
seconds
still
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
winner
was
a
better
boat
in
every
way
than
my
own
your
majesty
adds
to
the
sweets
of
victory
by
your
generous
acceptance
of
defeat
carne
replied
but
i
must
confess
that
i
owe
my
success
in
no
way
to
my
own
ability
the
boat
was
chosen
for
me
by
another
and
i
have
not
even
the
satisfaction
of
saying
that
i
sailed
her
myself
nevertheless
she
is
your
property
and
you
will
go
down
to
posterity
famous
in
yachting
annals
as
the
winner
of
the
queen
s
cup
in
this
justly
celebrated
year
with
this
compliment
his
majesty
turned
to
his
hostess
and
entered
into
conversation
with
her
leaving
his
free
to
discuss
the
events
of
the
day
with
lady
mabel
when
he
took
his
departure
later
carne
also
bade
his
friends
and
descending
to
his
boat
was
rowed
away
to
his
own
beautiful
steam
yacht
which
was
anchored
a
few
cables
length
away
from
the
imperial
craft
he
was
to
dine
on
board
the
latter
vessel
that
evening
on
gaining
the
deck
he
was
met
by
belton
his
valet
who
carried
a
telegram
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
he
received
it
carne
opened
it
and
glanced
at
the
contents
come
below
he
said
quickly
there
is
news
enough
here
to
give
us
something
to
think
of
for
hours
to
come
reaching
the
saloon
which
was
decorated
with
all
the
daintiness
of
the
upholsterer
s
art
he
led
the
way
to
the
cabin
he
had
arranged
as
a
study
having
entered
it
he
shut
and
locked
the
door
it
s
all
up
belton
he
said
the
comedy
has
lasted
long
enough
and
now
it
only
remains
for
us
to
speak
the
tag
and
after
that
to
ring
the
curtain
down
as
speedily
as
may
be
i
am
afraid
sir
i
do
not
quite
take
your
meaning
said
belton
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
has
happened
i
can
do
that
in
a
very
few
words
the
other
answered
this
cablegram
is
from
trincomalee
liz
and
was
dispatched
from
bombay
yesterday
read
it
for
yourself
he
handed
the
paper
to
his
servant
who
read
it
carefully
aloud
to
carne
portchester
house
park
lane
bradfield
left
fortnight
since
have
ascertained
that
you
are
the
object
trincomalee
this
is
very
serious
sir
said
the
other
when
he
had
finished
as
you
say
it
is
very
serious
indeed
carne
replied
bradfield
thinks
he
has
caught
me
at
last
i
suppose
but
he
seems
to
forget
that
it
is
possible
for
me
to
be
as
clever
as
himself
let
me
look
at
the
message
again
left
a
fortnight
ago
did
he
then
i
ve
still
a
little
respite
by
jove
if
that
s
the
case
i
ll
see
that
i
make
the
most
of
it
but
surely
sir
you
will
leave
at
once
said
belton
quickly
if
this
man
who
has
been
after
us
so
long
is
now
more
than
to
england
coming
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
running
you
to
earth
surely
sir
you
ll
see
the
advisability
of
making
your
escape
while
you
have
time
carne
smiled
indulgently
of
course
i
shall
escape
my
good
belton
he
said
you
have
never
known
me
to
neglect
to
take
proper
precautions
yet
but
before
i
go
i
must
do
one
more
piece
of
business
it
must
be
something
by
the
light
of
which
all
i
have
hitherto
accomplished
will
look
like
nothing
something
really
great
that
will
make
england
open
its
eyes
as
it
has
not
done
yet
belton
stared
at
him
this
time
in
undisguised
amazement
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
sir
he
said
with
the
freedom
of
a
privileged
servant
that
you
intend
to
run
another
risk
when
the
only
man
who
knows
sufficient
of
your
career
to
bring
you
to
book
is
certain
to
be
in
england
in
less
than
a
fortnight
i
can
not
believe
that
you
would
be
so
foolish
sir
i
beg
of
you
to
think
what
you
are
doing
carne
however
paid
but
small
attention
to
his
servant
s
entreaties
the
difficulty
he
said
to
himself
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
is
to
understand
quite
what
to
do
i
seem
to
have
used
up
all
my
big
chances
however
i
ll
think
it
over
and
it
will
be
strange
if
i
don
t
hit
upon
something
in
the
meantime
belton
you
had
better
see
that
preparations
are
made
for
leaving
england
on
friday
next
tell
the
skipper
to
have
everything
ready
we
shall
have
done
our
work
by
that
time
then
hey
for
the
open
sea
and
freedom
from
the
trammels
of
a
society
life
once
more
you
might
drop
a
hint
or
two
to
certain
people
that
i
am
going
but
be
more
than
careful
what
you
say
write
to
the
agents
about
portchester
house
and
attend
to
all
the
other
necessary
details
you
may
leave
me
now
belton
bowed
and
left
the
cabin
without
another
word
he
knew
his
master
sufficiently
well
to
feel
certain
that
neither
entreaties
nor
expostulations
would
make
him
abandon
the
course
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
that
being
so
he
bowed
to
the
inevitable
with
a
grace
which
had
now
become
a
habit
to
him
when
he
was
alone
carne
once
more
sat
for
upwards
of
an
hour
in
earnest
thought
he
then
ordered
his
gig
and
when
it
was
ready
set
out
for
the
shore
making
his
way
to
the
telegraph
office
he
dispatched
a
message
which
at
any
other
and
less
busy
time
would
have
caused
the
operator
some
astonishment
it
was
addressed
to
a
mahommedan
dealer
in
precious
stones
in
bombay
and
contained
only
two
words
in
addition
to
the
signature
they
were
leaving
come
he
knew
that
they
would
reach
the
person
for
whom
they
were
intended
and
that
she
would
understand
their
meaning
and
act
accordingly
the
dinner
that
night
on
board
the
imperial
yacht
was
a
gorgeous
affair
in
every
sense
of
the
word
all
the
principal
were
present
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
banquet
carne
s
health
as
winner
of
the
great
event
of
the
regatta
was
proposed
by
the
emperor
himself
and
drunk
amid
enthusiastic
applause
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
the
individual
in
question
but
he
bore
his
honors
with
that
quiet
dignity
that
had
stood
him
in
such
good
stead
on
so
many
similar
occasions
in
his
speech
he
referred
to
his
approaching
departure
from
england
and
this
the
first
inkling
of
such
news
came
upon
his
audience
like
a
when
they
had
taken
leave
of
his
majesty
soon
after
midnight
and
were
standing
on
deck
waiting
for
their
respective
boats
to
draw
up
to
the
accommodation
ladder
lord
orpington
made
his
way
to
where
simon
carne
was
standing
is
it
really
true
that
you
intend
leaving
us
so
soon
he
asked
quite
true
unfortunately
carne
replied
i
had
hoped
to
have
remained
longer
but
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
make
it
imperative
that
i
should
return
to
india
without
delay
business
that
exercises
a
vital
influence
upon
my
fortunes
compels
me
i
am
therefore
obliged
to
leave
without
fail
on
friday
next
i
have
given
orders
to
that
effect
this
afternoon
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
hear
it
that
s
all
i
can
say
said
lord
amberley
who
had
just
come
up
i
assure
you
we
shall
all
miss
you
very
much
indeed
you
have
all
been
extremely
kind
said
carne
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
an
exceedingly
pleasant
time
but
there
let
us
postpone
consideration
of
the
matter
for
as
long
as
possible
i
think
this
is
my
boat
won
t
you
let
me
take
you
as
far
as
your
own
yacht
many
thanks
but
i
don
t
think
we
need
trouble
you
said
lord
orpington
i
see
my
gig
is
just
behind
yours
in
that
case
said
carne
i
shall
see
you
as
arranged
morning
i
suppose
at
eleven
said
lord
amberley
we
ll
call
for
you
and
go
ashore
together
by
the
time
carne
had
reached
his
yacht
he
had
made
up
his
mind
he
had
also
hit
upon
a
scheme
the
daring
of
which
almost
frightened
himself
if
only
he
could
bring
it
off
he
told
himself
it
would
be
indeed
a
fitting
climax
to
all
he
had
accomplished
since
he
had
arrived
in
england
retiring
to
his
cabin
he
allowed
belton
to
assist
him
in
his
preparations
for
the
night
almost
without
speaking
it
was
not
until
the
other
was
about
to
leave
the
cabin
that
he
broached
the
subject
that
was
occupying
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
belton
he
said
i
have
decided
upon
the
greatest
scheme
that
has
come
into
my
mind
yet
if
simon
carne
is
going
to
say
farewell
to
the
english
people
on
friday
next
and
it
succeeds
he
will
leave
them
a
legacy
to
think
about
for
some
time
after
he
has
gone
you
are
surely
not
going
to
attempt
anything
further
sir
said
belton
in
alarm
i
did
hope
sir
that
you
would
have
listened
to
my
entreaties
this
afternoon
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
said
carne
i
am
afraid
belton
you
are
a
little
lacking
in
ambition
i
have
noticed
that
on
the
last
three
occasions
you
have
endeavored
to
dissuade
me
from
my
endeavors
to
promote
the
healthy
excitement
of
the
english
reading
public
on
this
occasion
fortunately
i
am
able
to
withstand
you
morning
you
will
commence
preparations
for
the
biggest
piece
of
work
to
which
i
have
yet
put
my
hand
if
you
have
set
your
mind
upon
doing
it
sir
i
am
quite
aware
that
it
is
hopeless
for
me
to
say
anything
said
belton
resignedly
may
i
know
however
what
it
is
going
to
be
carne
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
replied
i
happen
to
know
that
the
emperor
of
westphalia
whose
friendship
i
have
the
honor
to
claim
he
said
has
a
magnificent
collection
of
gold
plate
on
board
his
yacht
it
is
my
intention
if
possible
to
become
the
possessor
of
it
surely
that
will
be
impossible
sir
said
belton
clever
as
you
undoubtedly
are
in
arranging
these
things
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
do
it
a
ship
at
the
best
of
times
is
such
a
public
place
and
they
will
be
certain
to
guard
it
very
closely
i
must
confess
that
at
first
glance
i
do
not
quite
see
how
it
is
to
be
managed
but
i
have
a
scheme
in
my
head
which
i
think
may
possibly
enable
me
to
effect
my
purpose
at
any
rate
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
more
about
it
first
let
us
try
a
little
experiment
as
he
spoke
he
seated
himself
at
his
and
bade
belton
bring
him
a
box
which
had
hitherto
been
standing
in
a
corner
when
he
opened
it
it
proved
to
be
a
pretty
little
affair
divided
into
a
number
of
small
compartments
each
of
which
contained
crépe
hair
of
a
different
color
selecting
a
small
portion
from
one
particular
compartment
he
unravelled
it
until
he
had
obtained
the
length
he
wanted
and
then
with
dexterous
fingers
constructed
a
moustache
which
he
attached
with
spirit
gum
to
his
upper
lip
two
or
three
twirls
gave
it
the
necessary
curl
then
with
a
pair
of
brushes
taken
from
the
he
brushed
his
hair
back
in
a
peculiar
manner
placed
a
hat
of
uncommon
shape
upon
his
head
took
a
heavy
boat
cloak
from
a
cupboard
near
at
hand
threw
it
round
his
shoulders
and
assuming
an
almost
defiant
expression
faced
belton
and
desired
him
to
tell
him
whom
he
resembled
familiar
as
he
was
with
his
master
s
marvelous
power
of
disguise
and
his
extraordinary
faculty
of
imitation
the
latter
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
astonishment
his
imperial
majesty
the
emperor
of
westphalia
he
said
the
likeness
is
perfect
good
said
carne
from
that
exhibition
you
will
gather
something
of
my
plan
evening
as
you
are
aware
i
am
invited
to
meet
his
majesty
who
is
to
dine
ashore
accompanied
by
his
count
von
walzburg
here
is
the
latter
s
photograph
he
possesses
as
you
know
a
very
decided
personality
which
is
all
in
our
favor
study
it
carefully
so
saying
he
took
from
a
drawer
a
photograph
which
he
propped
against
the
on
the
before
him
it
represented
a
tall
individual
with
bristling
eyebrows
a
large
nose
a
heavy
grey
moustache
and
hair
of
the
same
color
belton
examined
it
carefully
i
can
only
suppose
sir
he
said
that
as
you
are
telling
me
this
you
intend
me
to
represent
count
von
walzburg
exactly
said
carne
that
is
my
intention
it
should
not
be
at
all
difficult
the
count
is
just
your
height
and
build
you
will
only
need
the
moustache
the
eyebrows
the
grey
hair
and
the
large
nose
to
look
the
part
exactly
will
be
a
dark
night
and
if
only
i
can
control
circumstances
sufficiently
to
obtain
the
chance
i
want
detection
in
the
first
part
of
our
scheme
at
any
rate
should
be
more
unlikely
if
not
almost
impossible
you
ll
excuse
my
saying
so
i
hope
sir
said
belton
but
it
seems
a
very
risky
game
to
play
when
we
have
done
so
well
up
to
the
present
you
must
admit
that
the
glory
will
be
the
greater
my
friend
if
we
succeed
but
surely
sir
as
i
said
just
now
they
keep
the
plate
you
mention
in
a
secure
place
and
have
it
properly
guarded
i
have
made
the
fullest
inquiries
you
may
be
sure
it
is
kept
in
a
safe
in
the
chief
steward
s
cabin
and
while
it
is
on
board
a
sentry
is
always
on
duty
at
the
door
yes
all
things
considered
i
should
say
it
is
kept
in
a
remarkably
secure
place
then
sir
i
m
still
at
a
loss
to
see
how
you
are
going
to
obtain
possession
of
it
carne
smiled
indulgently
it
pleased
him
to
see
how
perplexed
his
servant
was
in
the
simplest
manner
possible
he
said
provided
always
that
i
can
get
on
board
the
yacht
without
my
identity
being
questioned
the
manner
in
which
we
are
to
leave
the
vessel
will
be
rather
more
dangerous
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
cause
us
any
great
uneasiness
you
are
a
good
swimmer
i
know
so
that
a
hundred
yards
should
not
hurt
you
you
must
also
have
a
number
of
stout
canvas
sacks
say
six
prepared
and
securely
attached
to
each
the
same
number
of
strong
lines
the
latter
must
be
fifty
fathoms
long
and
have
at
the
end
of
each
a
stout
the
rest
is
only
a
matter
of
detail
now
what
have
you
arranged
with
regard
to
matters
in
town
i
have
fulfilled
your
instructions
sir
to
the
letter
said
belton
i
have
communicated
with
the
agents
who
act
for
the
owner
of
portchester
house
i
have
caused
an
advertisement
to
be
inserted
in
all
the
papers
morning
to
the
effect
that
the
renowned
detective
klimo
will
be
unable
to
meet
his
clients
for
at
least
a
month
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
has
accepted
an
important
engagement
upon
the
continent
which
will
take
him
from
home
for
that
length
of
time
i
have
negotiated
the
sale
of
the
various
horses
you
have
in
training
and
i
have
also
arranged
for
the
disposal
of
the
animals
and
carriages
you
have
now
in
use
in
london
ram
gafur
and
the
other
native
servants
at
portchester
house
will
come
down
by
the
train
but
before
they
do
so
they
will
fulfill
your
instructions
and
repair
the
hole
in
the
wall
between
the
two
houses
i
can
not
think
of
any
more
sir
you
have
succeeded
admirably
my
dear
belton
said
carne
and
i
am
very
pleased
you
had
better
see
that
a
paragraph
is
inserted
in
all
the
daily
papers
announcing
the
fact
that
it
is
my
intention
to
leave
england
for
india
immediately
on
important
private
business
i
think
that
will
do
for
next
morning
he
was
up
by
sunrise
and
by
the
time
his
friends
lords
orpington
and
amberley
were
thinking
about
breakfast
had
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
scheme
which
was
to
bring
his
career
in
england
to
such
a
fitting
termination
according
to
the
arrangement
entered
into
on
the
previous
day
his
friends
called
for
him
at
eleven
o
clock
when
they
went
ashore
together
it
was
a
lovely
morning
and
carne
was
in
the
highest
spirits
they
visited
the
castle
together
made
some
purchases
in
the
town
and
then
went
off
to
lunch
on
board
lord
orpington
s
yacht
it
was
three
o
clock
before
carne
bade
his
host
and
hostess
farewell
and
descended
the
gangway
in
order
to
return
to
his
own
vessel
a
brisk
sea
was
running
and
for
this
reason
to
step
into
the
boat
was
an
exceedingly
difficult
if
not
a
dangerous
matter
either
he
miscalculated
his
distance
or
he
must
have
jumped
at
the
wrong
moment
at
any
rate
he
missed
his
footing
and
fell
heavily
on
to
the
bottom
scarcely
a
second
however
had
elapsed
before
his
coxswain
had
sprung
to
his
assistance
and
lifted
him
up
on
to
the
seat
in
the
stern
it
was
then
discovered
that
he
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
once
more
give
a
nasty
twist
to
the
ankle
which
had
brought
him
to
such
grief
when
he
had
been
staying
at
greenthorpe
park
on
the
occasion
of
the
famous
wedding
my
dear
fellow
i
am
so
sorry
said
lord
orpington
who
had
witnessed
the
accident
won
t
you
come
on
board
again
we
can
easily
hoist
you
over
the
side
many
thanks
replied
carne
but
i
think
i
can
manage
to
get
back
to
my
own
boat
it
is
better
i
should
do
so
my
man
has
had
experience
of
my
little
ailments
and
knows
exactly
what
is
best
to
be
done
under
such
circumstances
but
it
is
a
terrible
nuisance
all
the
same
i
m
afraid
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
now
to
be
present
at
his
royal
highness
s
dinner
this
evening
and
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
we
shall
all
be
exceedingly
sorry
said
lord
amberley
i
shall
come
across
in
the
afternoon
to
see
how
you
are
you
are
very
kind
said
carne
and
i
shall
be
immensely
glad
to
see
you
if
you
can
spare
the
time
with
that
he
gave
the
signal
to
his
man
to
push
off
by
the
time
he
reached
his
own
yacht
his
foot
was
so
painful
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
lifted
on
board
a
circumstance
which
was
duly
noticed
by
the
occupants
of
all
the
surrounding
yachts
who
had
brought
their
glasses
to
bear
upon
him
once
below
in
his
saloon
he
was
placed
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
left
to
belton
s
careful
attention
i
trust
you
have
not
hurt
yourself
very
much
sir
said
that
faithful
individual
who
however
could
not
prevent
a
look
of
satisfaction
coming
into
his
face
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
that
his
master
would
after
all
be
prevented
from
carrying
out
the
hazardous
scheme
he
had
proposed
to
him
the
previous
evening
in
reply
carne
sprang
to
his
feet
without
showing
a
trace
of
lameness
my
dear
belton
how
peculiarly
dense
you
are
he
said
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
the
other
s
amazement
can
not
you
see
that
i
have
only
been
acting
as
you
yourself
wished
i
should
do
early
this
morning
namely
taking
precautions
surely
you
must
see
that
if
i
am
laid
up
on
board
my
yacht
with
a
sprained
ankle
society
will
say
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
doing
any
mischief
elsewhere
now
tell
me
is
everything
prepared
for
everything
sir
belton
replied
the
dresses
and
wigs
are
ready
the
canvas
sacks
and
the
lines
to
which
the
spring
hooks
are
attached
are
in
your
cabin
awaiting
your
inspection
as
far
as
i
can
see
everything
is
prepared
and
i
hope
will
meet
with
your
satisfaction
if
you
are
as
careful
as
usual
i
feel
sure
it
will
said
carne
now
get
some
bandages
and
make
this
foot
of
mine
up
into
as
artistic
a
bundle
as
you
possibly
can
after
that
help
me
on
deck
and
prop
me
up
in
a
chair
as
soon
as
my
accident
gets
known
there
will
be
certain
to
be
shoals
of
callers
on
board
and
i
must
play
my
part
as
carefully
as
possible
day
closed
in
and
found
the
sky
covered
with
heavy
clouds
towards
eight
o
clock
a
violent
storm
of
rain
fell
and
when
carne
heard
it
beating
upon
the
deck
above
his
cabin
and
reflected
that
in
consequence
the
night
would
in
all
probability
be
dark
he
felt
his
lucky
star
was
indeed
in
the
ascendant
at
eight
he
retired
to
his
cabin
with
belton
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
events
of
the
evening
never
before
had
he
paid
such
careful
attention
to
his
he
knew
that
on
this
occasion
the
least
carelessness
might
lead
to
detection
and
he
had
no
desire
that
his
last
and
greatest
exploit
should
prove
his
undoing
it
was
nine
before
he
and
his
servant
had
dressed
and
were
ready
to
set
off
then
placing
hats
upon
their
heads
and
carrying
a
portmanteau
containing
the
cloaks
and
headgear
which
they
were
to
wear
later
in
the
evening
they
went
on
deck
and
descended
into
the
dinghy
which
was
waiting
for
them
alongside
in
something
under
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
had
been
put
ashore
in
a
secluded
spot
had
changed
their
costumes
and
were
walking
boldly
down
beside
the
water
towards
the
steps
where
they
could
see
the
imperial
launch
still
waiting
her
crew
were
lolling
about
joking
and
laughing
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
it
would
be
some
hours
at
least
before
their
sovereign
would
be
likely
to
require
their
services
again
their
astonishment
therefore
may
well
be
imagined
when
they
saw
approaching
them
the
two
men
whom
they
had
only
before
brought
ashore
stepping
in
and
taking
his
seat
under
the
shelter
his
majesty
ordered
them
to
convey
him
back
to
the
yacht
with
all
speed
the
accent
and
voice
were
perfect
and
it
never
for
an
instant
struck
any
one
on
board
the
boat
that
a
deception
was
being
practiced
carne
however
was
aware
that
this
was
only
a
preliminary
the
most
dangerous
portion
of
the
business
was
yet
to
come
on
reaching
the
yacht
he
sprang
out
on
the
ladder
followed
by
his
von
walzburg
and
mounted
the
steps
his
disguise
must
have
been
perfect
indeed
for
when
he
reached
the
deck
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
first
lieutenant
who
on
seeing
him
saluted
respectfully
for
a
moment
carne
s
presence
of
mind
almost
deserted
him
then
seeing
that
he
was
not
discovered
he
determined
upon
a
bold
piece
of
bluff
returning
the
officer
s
salute
with
just
the
air
he
had
seen
the
emperor
use
he
led
him
to
suppose
that
he
had
important
reasons
for
coming
on
board
so
soon
and
as
if
to
back
this
assertion
up
bade
him
send
the
chief
steward
to
his
cabin
and
at
the
same
time
had
the
sentry
removed
from
his
door
and
placed
at
the
end
of
the
large
saloon
with
instructions
to
allow
no
one
to
pass
until
he
was
communicated
with
again
the
officer
saluted
and
went
off
on
his
errand
while
carne
signing
to
belton
to
follow
him
made
his
way
down
the
companion
ladder
to
the
royal
cabins
to
both
the
next
few
minutes
seemed
like
hours
reaching
the
imperial
stateroom
they
entered
it
and
closed
the
door
behind
provided
the
sentry
obeyed
his
orders
which
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
he
would
do
and
the
emperor
himself
did
not
return
until
they
were
safely
off
the
vessel
again
there
seemed
every
probability
of
their
being
able
to
carry
out
their
scheme
without
a
hitch
put
those
bags
under
the
table
and
unwind
the
lines
and
place
them
in
the
gallery
outside
the
window
they
won
t
be
seen
there
said
carne
to
belton
who
was
watching
him
from
the
doorway
then
stand
by
for
in
a
few
minutes
the
chief
steward
will
be
here
as
soon
as
he
enters
you
must
manage
to
get
between
him
and
the
door
and
while
i
am
engaging
him
in
conversation
spring
on
him
clutch
him
by
the
throat
and
hold
him
until
i
can
force
this
gag
into
his
mouth
after
that
we
shall
be
safe
for
some
time
at
least
for
not
a
soul
will
come
this
way
until
they
discover
their
mistake
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
thank
our
stars
that
the
chief
steward
s
cabin
was
placed
in
such
a
convenient
position
but
hush
here
comes
the
individual
we
want
be
ready
to
collar
him
as
soon
as
i
hold
up
my
hand
if
he
makes
a
sound
we
are
lost
he
had
scarcely
spoken
before
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
when
it
opened
the
chief
steward
entered
the
cabin
closing
the
door
behind
him
schmidt
said
his
majesty
who
was
standing
at
the
further
end
of
the
cabin
i
have
sent
for
you
in
order
that
i
may
question
you
on
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
draw
nearer
the
man
came
forward
as
he
was
ordered
and
having
done
so
looked
his
master
full
and
fair
in
the
face
something
he
saw
there
seemed
to
stagger
him
he
glanced
at
him
a
second
time
and
was
immediately
confirmed
in
his
belief
you
are
not
the
emperor
he
cried
there
is
some
treachery
in
this
i
shall
call
for
assistance
he
had
half
turned
and
was
about
to
give
the
alarm
when
carne
held
up
his
hand
and
belton
who
had
been
creeping
stealthily
up
behind
him
threw
himself
upon
him
and
had
clutched
him
by
the
throat
before
he
could
utter
a
sound
the
fictitious
emperor
immediately
produced
a
cleverly
constructed
gag
and
forced
it
into
the
terrified
man
s
mouth
who
in
another
second
was
lying
upon
the
floor
bound
hand
and
foot
there
my
friend
said
carne
quietly
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
a
few
moments
later
i
don
t
think
you
will
give
us
any
further
trouble
let
me
just
see
that
those
straps
are
tight
enough
and
then
we
ll
place
you
on
this
settee
and
afterwards
get
to
business
with
all
possible
dispatch
having
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
he
signed
to
belton
and
between
them
they
placed
the
man
upon
the
couch
let
me
see
i
think
if
i
remember
rightly
you
carry
the
key
of
the
safe
in
this
pocket
so
saying
he
turned
the
man
s
pocket
inside
out
and
appropriated
the
bunch
of
keys
he
found
therein
choosing
one
from
it
he
gave
a
final
look
at
the
bonds
which
secured
the
prostrate
figure
and
then
turned
to
belton
i
think
he
ll
do
he
said
now
for
business
bring
the
bags
and
come
with
me
so
saying
he
crossed
the
cabin
and
having
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
one
about
to
pry
upon
them
passed
along
the
luxuriously
carpeted
alley
way
until
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
assigned
to
the
use
of
the
chief
steward
and
in
which
was
the
safe
containing
the
magnificent
gold
plate
the
obtaining
of
which
was
the
reason
of
his
being
there
to
his
surprise
and
chagrin
the
door
was
closed
and
locked
in
his
plans
he
had
omitted
to
allow
for
this
emergency
in
all
probability
however
the
key
was
in
the
man
s
pocket
so
turning
to
belton
he
bade
him
return
to
the
stateroom
and
bring
him
the
keys
he
had
thrown
upon
the
table
the
latter
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
when
he
had
disappeared
carne
stood
alone
in
the
alley
way
waiting
and
listening
to
the
various
noises
of
the
great
vessel
on
the
deck
overhead
he
could
hear
some
one
tramping
heavily
up
and
down
and
then
in
an
interval
of
silence
the
sound
of
pouring
rain
good
reason
as
he
had
to
be
anxious
he
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
thought
of
the
incongruity
of
his
position
he
wondered
what
his
aristocratic
friends
would
say
if
he
were
captured
and
his
story
came
to
light
in
his
time
he
had
impersonated
a
good
many
people
but
never
before
had
he
had
the
honor
of
occupying
such
an
exalted
station
this
was
the
last
and
most
daring
of
all
his
adventures
minutes
went
by
and
as
belton
did
not
return
carne
found
himself
growing
nervous
what
could
have
become
of
him
he
was
in
the
act
of
going
in
search
of
him
when
he
appeared
carrying
in
his
hand
the
bunch
of
keys
for
which
he
had
been
sent
his
master
seized
them
eagerly
why
have
you
been
so
long
he
asked
in
a
whisper
i
began
to
think
something
had
gone
wrong
with
you
i
stayed
to
make
our
friend
secure
the
other
answered
he
had
managed
to
get
one
of
his
hands
free
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
had
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
in
no
time
and
have
given
the
alarm
then
we
should
have
been
caught
like
rats
in
a
trap
are
you
quite
sure
he
is
secure
now
asked
carne
anxiously
quite
replied
belton
i
took
good
care
of
that
in
that
case
we
had
better
get
to
work
on
the
safe
without
further
delay
we
have
wasted
too
much
time
already
and
every
moment
is
an
added
danger
without
more
ado
carne
placed
the
most
likely
key
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
the
bolt
shot
back
and
the
treasure
chamber
lay
at
his
mercy
the
cabin
was
not
a
large
one
but
it
was
plain
that
every
precaution
had
been
taken
to
render
it
secure
the
large
safe
which
contained
the
imperial
plate
and
which
it
was
carne
s
intention
to
rifle
occupied
one
entire
side
it
was
of
the
latest
design
and
when
carne
saw
it
he
had
to
confess
to
himself
that
expert
craftsman
as
he
was
it
was
one
that
would
have
required
all
his
time
and
skill
to
open
with
the
master
key
however
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
few
seconds
the
key
was
turned
the
lever
depressed
and
then
with
a
slight
pull
the
heavy
door
swung
forward
this
done
it
was
seen
that
the
interior
was
full
to
overflowing
come
belton
he
said
get
these
things
out
as
quickly
as
possible
and
lay
them
on
the
floor
we
can
carry
only
away
a
certain
portion
of
the
plunder
so
let
us
make
sure
that
that
portion
is
the
best
a
few
moments
later
the
entire
cabin
was
strewn
with
salvers
goblets
bowls
epergnes
gold
and
silver
dishes
plates
cups
knives
forks
and
almost
every
example
of
the
goldsmith
s
art
in
his
choice
carne
was
not
guided
by
what
was
handsomest
or
most
delicate
in
workmanship
or
shape
weight
was
his
only
standard
silver
he
discarded
altogether
for
it
was
of
less
than
no
account
in
something
under
ten
minutes
he
had
made
his
selection
and
the
stout
canvas
bags
they
had
brought
with
them
for
that
purpose
were
full
to
their
utmost
holding
capacity
we
can
carry
no
more
said
carne
to
his
faithful
retainer
as
they
made
the
mouth
of
the
last
bag
secure
pick
up
yours
and
let
us
get
back
to
the
emperor
s
stateroom
having
locked
the
door
of
the
cabin
they
returned
to
the
place
whence
they
had
started
there
they
found
the
unfortunate
steward
lying
on
the
settee
placing
the
bags
he
carried
upon
the
ground
carne
crossed
to
him
and
before
doing
anything
else
carefully
examined
the
bonds
with
which
he
was
secured
having
done
this
he
went
to
the
stern
windows
and
throwing
one
open
stepped
into
the
gallery
outside
fortunately
for
what
he
intended
to
do
it
was
still
raining
heavily
and
in
consequence
the
night
was
as
dark
as
the
most
consummate
conspirator
could
have
desired
returning
to
the
room
he
bade
belton
help
him
carry
the
bags
into
the
gallery
and
when
this
had
been
done
made
fast
the
to
the
rings
in
the
mouth
of
each
take
up
your
bags
as
quietly
as
possible
he
said
and
lower
them
one
by
one
into
the
water
but
take
care
that
they
don
t
get
entangled
in
the
propeller
when
you
ve
done
that
slip
the
rings
at
the
other
end
of
the
lines
through
your
belt
and
buckle
the
latter
tightly
belton
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
in
a
few
moments
the
six
bags
were
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
now
off
with
these
wigs
and
things
and
say
when
you
re
ready
for
a
swim
their
disguises
having
been
discarded
and
thrown
overboard
carne
and
belton
clambered
over
the
rails
of
the
gallery
and
lowered
themselves
until
their
feet
touched
the
water
next
moment
they
had
both
let
go
and
were
swimming
in
the
direction
of
carne
s
own
yacht
much
exhausted
they
reached
the
yacht
s
stern
and
clutched
at
the
rope
ladder
which
carne
had
himself
placed
there
before
he
had
set
out
on
the
evening
s
excursion
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
he
had
mounted
it
and
gained
the
deck
followed
by
his
faithful
servant
they
presented
a
sorry
spectacle
as
they
stood
side
by
side
at
the
taffrail
the
water
dripping
from
their
clothes
and
pattering
upon
the
deck
thank
goodness
we
are
here
at
last
said
carne
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
breath
sufficiently
to
speak
now
slip
off
your
belt
and
hang
it
over
this
cleat
with
mine
belton
did
as
he
was
directed
and
then
followed
his
master
to
the
saloon
companion
ladder
once
below
they
changed
their
clothes
as
quickly
as
possible
and
having
donned
mackintoshes
returned
to
the
deck
where
it
was
still
raining
hard
now
said
carne
for
the
last
and
most
important
part
of
our
evening
s
work
let
us
hope
the
lines
will
prove
equal
to
the
demands
we
are
about
to
make
upon
them
as
he
said
this
he
took
one
of
the
belts
from
his
cleat
upon
which
he
had
placed
it
and
having
detached
a
line
began
to
pull
it
in
belton
following
his
example
with
another
their
hopes
that
they
would
prove
equal
to
the
confidence
placed
in
them
proved
well
founded
for
in
something
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
six
bags
containing
the
emperor
of
westphalia
s
magnificent
gold
plate
were
lying
upon
the
deck
ready
to
be
carried
below
and
stowed
away
in
the
secret
place
in
which
carne
had
arranged
to
hide
his
treasure
now
belton
said
carne
as
he
pushed
the
panel
back
into
its
place
and
pressed
the
secret
spring
that
locked
it
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
with
what
we
have
done
we
ve
made
a
splendid
haul
and
you
shall
have
your
share
of
it
in
the
meantime
just
get
me
to
bed
as
quickly
as
you
can
for
i
m
dead
tired
when
you
ve
done
so
be
off
to
your
own
morning
you
will
have
to
go
up
town
to
arrange
with
the
bank
authorities
about
my
account
belton
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
later
his
master
was
safely
in
bed
and
asleep
it
was
late
next
morning
when
he
awoke
he
had
scarcely
breakfasted
before
the
earl
of
amberley
and
lord
orpington
made
their
appearance
over
the
side
to
carry
out
the
part
he
had
arranged
to
play
he
received
them
seated
in
his
deck
chair
his
right
foot
reclining
on
a
cushion
before
him
on
seeing
his
guests
he
made
as
if
he
would
rise
but
they
begged
him
to
remain
seated
i
hope
your
ankle
is
better
this
morning
said
lord
orpington
politely
as
he
took
a
chair
beside
his
friend
much
better
thank
you
carne
replied
it
was
not
nearly
so
serious
as
i
feared
i
hope
to
be
able
to
hobble
about
a
little
this
afternoon
and
now
tell
me
the
news
if
there
is
any
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
not
heard
the
great
news
asked
lord
amberley
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
i
have
heard
nothing
carne
replied
remember
i
have
not
been
ashore
this
morning
and
i
have
been
so
busily
engaged
with
the
preparations
for
my
departure
that
i
have
not
had
time
to
look
at
my
papers
pray
what
is
this
news
of
which
you
speak
with
such
bated
breath
listen
and
i
ll
tell
you
lord
orpington
answered
and
he
related
the
events
of
the
previous
night
carne
s
face
in
the
meantime
showing
great
astonishment
good
gracious
said
carne
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
surely
it
s
the
most
impudent
robbery
that
has
taken
place
for
many
years
past
to
represent
the
emperor
of
westphalia
and
his
so
closely
that
they
could
deceive
even
the
officers
of
his
own
yacht
and
to
take
a
sentry
off
one
post
and
place
him
in
such
a
position
as
to
protect
them
while
at
their
own
nefarious
work
seems
to
me
the
very
height
of
audacity
but
how
did
they
get
their
booty
away
again
gold
plate
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
is
by
no
means
an
easy
thing
to
carry
as
he
asked
this
question
carne
lit
another
cigar
with
a
hand
as
steady
as
a
rock
they
must
have
escaped
in
a
boat
that
it
is
supposed
was
lying
under
the
shelter
of
the
stern
gallery
replied
lord
amberley
and
is
the
chief
steward
able
to
furnish
the
police
with
no
clue
as
to
their
identity
none
whatever
replied
orpington
he
opines
to
the
belief
however
that
they
are
frenchmen
one
of
them
the
man
who
impersonated
the
emperor
seems
to
have
uttered
an
exclamation
in
that
tongue
and
when
was
the
robbery
discovered
only
when
the
real
emperor
returned
to
the
vessel
shortly
after
midnight
there
was
no
launch
to
meet
him
and
he
had
to
get
tremorden
to
take
him
off
you
can
easily
imagine
the
surprise
his
arrival
occasioned
it
was
intensified
when
they
went
below
to
find
his
majesty
s
cabin
turned
upside
down
the
chief
steward
lying
bound
and
gagged
upon
the
sofa
and
all
that
was
most
valuable
of
the
gold
plate
missing
what
an
extraordinary
story
and
now
having
told
you
the
news
with
which
the
place
is
ringing
we
must
be
off
about
our
business
said
orpington
is
it
quite
certain
that
you
are
going
to
leave
us
quite
i
am
sorry
to
say
answered
carne
i
am
going
to
ask
as
many
of
my
friends
as
possible
to
do
me
the
honor
of
lunching
with
me
at
one
o
clock
and
at
five
i
shall
weigh
anchor
and
bid
england
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
i
hope
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
said
orpington
and
i
also
replied
amberley
then
for
the
present
it
s
just
possible
i
may
see
you
again
during
the
afternoon
the
luncheon
next
day
was
as
brilliant
a
social
gathering
as
the
most
fastidious
in
such
matters
could
have
desired
every
one
then
in
cowes
who
had
any
claim
to
distinction
was
present
and
several
had
undertaken
the
journey
from
town
in
order
to
say
farewell
to
one
who
had
made
himself
so
popular
during
his
brief
stay
in
england
when
carne
rose
to
reply
to
the
toast
of
his
health
proposed
by
the
prime
minister
it
was
observable
that
he
was
genuinely
moved
as
indeed
were
most
of
his
hearers
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
his
yacht
s
deck
was
crowded
with
his
friends
all
of
whom
expressed
the
hope
that
it
might
not
be
very
long
before
he
was
amongst
them
once
more
to
these
kind
speeches
carne
invariably
offered
a
smiling
reply
i
also
trust
it
will
not
be
long
he
answered
i
have
enjoyed
my
visit
immensely
and
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
live
an
hour
later
the
anchor
was
weighed
and
his
yacht
was
steaming
out
of
the
harbor
amid
the
scene
of
intense
enthusiasm
as
the
prime
minister
had
that
afternoon
informed
him
in
the
public
interest
the
excitement
of
his
departure
was
dividing
the
honors
of
the
burglary
of
the
emperor
of
westphalia
s
gold
plate
carne
stood
beside
his
captain
on
the
bridge
watching
the
little
fleet
of
yachts
until
his
eyes
could
no
longer
distinguish
them
then
he
turned
to
belton
who
had
just
joined
him
and
placing
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
said
so
much
for
our
life
in
england
belton
my
friend
it
has
been
glorious
fun
and
no
one
can
deny
that
from
a
business
point
of
view
it
has
been
eminently
satisfactory
you
at
least
should
have
no
regrets
none
whatever
answered
belton
but
i
must
confess
i
should
like
to
know
what
they
will
say
when
the
truth
comes
out
carne
smiled
sweetly
as
he
answered
i
think
they
ll
say
that
all
things
considered
i
have
won
the
right
to
call
myself
a
prince
of
the
end
