introductory
note
benjamin
franklin
was
born
in
milk
street
boston
on
january
his
father
josiah
franklin
was
a
tallow
chandler
who
married
twice
and
of
his
seventeen
children
benjamin
was
the
youngest
son
his
schooling
ended
at
ten
and
at
twelve
he
was
bound
apprentice
to
his
brother
james
a
printer
who
published
the
new
england
courant
to
this
journal
he
became
a
contributor
and
later
was
for
a
time
its
nominal
editor
but
the
brothers
quarreled
and
benjamin
ran
away
going
first
to
new
york
and
thence
to
philadelphia
where
he
arrived
in
october
he
soon
obtained
work
as
a
printer
but
after
a
few
months
he
was
induced
by
governor
keith
to
go
to
london
where
finding
keith
promises
empty
he
again
worked
as
a
compositor
till
he
was
brought
back
to
philadelphia
by
a
merchant
named
denman
who
gave
him
a
position
in
his
business
on
denman
death
he
returned
to
his
former
trade
and
shortly
set
up
a
printing
house
of
his
own
from
which
he
published
the
pennsylvania
gazette
to
which
he
contributed
many
essays
and
which
he
made
a
medium
for
agitating
a
variety
of
local
reforms
in
he
began
to
issue
his
famous
poor
richard
almanac
for
the
enrichment
of
which
he
borrowed
or
composed
those
pithy
utterances
of
worldly
wisdom
which
are
the
basis
of
a
large
part
of
his
popular
reputation
in
the
year
in
which
he
ceased
writing
for
the
almanac
he
printed
in
it
father
abraham
sermon
now
regarded
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
literature
produced
in
colonial
america
meantime
franklin
was
concerning
himself
more
and
more
with
public
affairs
he
set
forth
a
scheme
for
an
academy
which
was
taken
up
later
and
finally
developed
into
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
he
founded
an
american
philosophical
society
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
scientific
men
to
communicate
their
discoveries
to
one
another
he
himself
had
already
begun
his
electrical
researches
which
with
other
scientific
inquiries
he
carried
on
in
the
intervals
of
and
politics
to
the
end
of
his
life
in
he
sold
his
business
in
order
to
get
leisure
for
study
having
now
acquired
comparative
wealth
and
in
a
few
years
he
had
made
discoveries
that
gave
him
a
reputation
with
the
learned
throughout
europe
in
politics
he
proved
very
able
both
as
an
administrator
and
as
a
controversialist
but
his
record
as
an
is
stained
by
the
use
he
made
of
his
position
to
advance
his
relatives
his
most
notable
service
in
home
politics
was
his
reform
of
the
postal
system
but
his
fame
as
a
statesman
rests
chiefly
on
his
services
in
connection
with
the
relations
of
the
colonies
with
great
britain
and
later
with
france
in
he
was
sent
to
england
to
protest
against
the
influence
of
the
penns
in
the
government
of
the
colony
and
for
five
years
he
remained
there
striving
to
enlighten
the
people
and
the
ministry
of
england
as
to
colonial
conditions
on
his
return
to
america
he
played
an
honorable
part
in
the
paxton
affair
through
which
he
lost
his
seat
in
the
assembly
but
in
he
was
again
despatched
to
england
as
agent
for
the
colony
this
time
to
petition
the
king
to
resume
the
government
from
the
hands
of
the
proprietors
in
london
he
actively
opposed
the
proposed
stamp
act
but
lost
the
credit
for
this
and
much
of
his
popularity
through
his
securing
for
a
friend
the
office
of
stamp
agent
in
america
even
his
effective
work
in
helping
to
obtain
the
repeal
of
the
act
left
him
still
a
suspect
but
he
continued
his
efforts
to
present
the
case
for
the
colonies
as
the
troubles
thickened
toward
the
crisis
of
the
revolution
in
he
crossed
to
france
where
he
was
received
with
honor
but
before
his
return
home
in
he
lost
his
position
as
postmaster
through
his
share
in
divulging
to
massachusetts
the
famous
letter
of
hutchinson
and
oliver
on
his
arrival
in
philadelphia
he
was
chosen
a
member
of
the
continental
congress
and
in
he
was
despatched
to
france
as
commissioner
for
the
united
states
here
he
remained
till
the
favorite
of
french
society
and
with
such
success
did
he
conduct
the
affairs
of
his
country
that
when
he
finally
returned
he
received
a
place
only
second
to
that
of
washington
as
the
champion
of
american
independence
he
died
on
april
the
first
five
chapters
of
the
autobiography
were
composed
in
england
in
continued
in
and
again
in
at
which
date
he
brought
it
down
to
after
a
most
extraordinary
series
of
adventures
the
original
form
of
the
manuscript
was
finally
printed
by
john
bigelow
and
is
here
reproduced
in
recognition
of
its
value
as
a
picture
of
one
of
the
most
notable
personalities
of
colonial
times
and
of
its
acknowledged
rank
as
one
of
the
great
autobiographies
of
the
world
benjamin
franklin
his
autobiography
twyford
at
the
bishop
of
asaph
dear
son
i
have
ever
had
pleasure
in
obtaining
any
little
anecdotes
of
my
ancestors
you
may
remember
the
inquiries
i
made
among
the
remains
of
my
relations
when
you
were
with
me
in
england
and
the
journey
i
undertook
for
that
purpose
imagining
it
may
be
equally
agreeable
to
you
to
know
the
circumstances
of
my
life
many
of
which
you
are
yet
unacquainted
with
and
expecting
the
enjoyment
of
a
week
uninterrupted
leisure
in
my
present
country
retirement
i
sit
down
to
write
them
for
you
to
which
i
have
besides
some
other
inducements
having
emerged
from
the
poverty
and
obscurity
in
which
i
was
born
and
bred
to
a
state
of
affluence
and
some
degree
of
reputation
in
the
world
and
having
gone
so
far
through
life
with
a
considerable
share
of
felicity
the
conducing
means
i
made
use
of
which
with
the
blessing
of
god
so
well
succeeded
my
posterity
may
like
to
know
as
they
may
find
some
of
them
suitable
to
their
own
situations
and
therefore
fit
to
be
imitated
the
of
bishop
shipley
the
good
bishop
as
franklin
used
to
style
b
after
the
words
agreeable
to
the
words
some
of
were
interlined
and
afterward
b
that
felicity
when
i
reflected
on
it
has
induced
me
sometimes
to
say
that
were
it
offered
to
my
choice
i
should
have
no
objection
to
a
repetition
of
the
same
life
from
its
beginning
only
asking
the
advantages
authors
have
in
a
second
edition
to
correct
some
faults
of
the
first
so
i
might
besides
correcting
the
faults
change
some
sinister
accidents
and
events
of
it
for
others
more
favorable
but
though
this
were
denied
i
should
still
accept
the
offer
since
such
a
repetition
is
not
to
be
expected
the
next
thing
most
like
living
life
over
again
seems
to
be
a
recollection
of
that
life
and
to
make
that
recollection
as
durable
as
possible
by
putting
it
down
in
writing
hereby
too
i
shall
indulge
the
inclination
so
natural
in
old
men
to
be
talking
of
themselves
and
their
own
past
actions
and
i
shall
indulge
it
without
being
tiresome
to
others
who
through
respect
to
age
might
conceive
themselves
obliged
to
give
me
a
hearing
since
this
may
be
read
or
not
as
any
one
pleases
and
lastly
i
may
as
well
confess
it
since
my
denial
of
it
will
be
believed
by
nobody
perhaps
i
shall
a
good
deal
gratify
my
own
vanity
indeed
i
scarce
ever
heard
or
saw
the
introductory
words
without
vanity
i
may
say
but
some
vain
thing
immediately
followed
most
people
dislike
vanity
in
others
whatever
share
they
have
of
it
themselves
but
i
give
it
fair
quarter
wherever
i
meet
with
it
being
persuaded
that
it
is
often
productive
of
good
to
the
possessor
and
to
others
that
are
within
his
sphere
of
action
and
therefore
in
many
cases
it
would
not
be
altogether
absurd
if
a
man
were
to
thank
god
for
his
vanity
among
the
other
comforts
of
life
and
now
i
speak
of
thanking
god
i
desire
with
all
humility
to
acknowledge
that
i
owe
the
mentioned
happiness
of
my
past
life
to
his
kind
providence
which
lead
me
to
the
means
i
used
and
gave
them
success
my
belief
of
this
induces
me
to
hope
though
i
must
not
presume
that
the
same
goodness
will
still
be
exercised
toward
me
in
continuing
that
happiness
or
enabling
me
to
bear
a
fatal
reverse
which
i
may
experience
as
others
have
done
the
complexion
of
my
future
fortune
being
known
to
him
only
in
whose
power
it
is
to
bless
to
us
even
our
afflictions
the
notes
one
of
my
uncles
who
had
the
same
kind
of
curiosity
in
collecting
family
anecdotes
once
put
into
my
hands
furnished
me
with
several
particulars
relating
to
our
ancestors
from
these
notes
i
learned
that
the
family
had
lived
in
the
same
village
ecton
in
northamptonshire
for
three
hundred
years
and
how
much
longer
he
knew
not
perhaps
from
the
time
when
the
name
of
franklin
that
before
was
the
name
of
an
order
of
people
was
assumed
by
them
as
a
surname
when
others
took
surnames
all
over
the
kingdom
on
a
freehold
of
about
thirty
acres
aided
by
the
smith
business
which
had
continued
in
the
family
till
his
time
the
eldest
son
being
always
bred
to
that
business
a
custom
which
he
and
my
father
followed
as
to
their
eldest
sons
when
i
searched
the
registers
at
ecton
i
found
an
account
of
their
births
marriages
and
burials
from
the
year
only
there
being
no
registers
kept
in
that
parish
at
any
time
preceding
by
that
register
i
perceived
that
i
was
the
youngest
son
of
the
youngest
son
for
five
generations
back
my
grandfather
thomas
who
was
born
in
lived
at
ecton
till
he
grew
too
old
to
follow
business
longer
when
he
went
to
live
with
his
son
john
a
dyer
at
banbury
in
oxfordshire
with
whom
my
father
served
an
apprenticeship
there
my
grandfather
died
and
lies
buried
we
saw
his
gravestone
in
his
eldest
son
thomas
lived
in
the
house
at
ecton
and
left
it
with
the
land
to
his
only
child
a
daughter
who
with
her
husband
one
fisher
of
wellingborough
sold
it
to
isted
now
lord
of
the
manor
there
my
grandfather
had
four
sons
that
grew
up
viz
thomas
john
benjamin
and
josiah
i
will
give
you
what
account
i
can
of
them
at
this
distance
from
my
papers
and
if
these
are
not
lost
in
my
absence
you
will
among
them
find
many
more
particulars
thomas
was
bred
a
smith
under
his
father
but
being
ingenious
and
encouraged
in
learning
as
all
my
brothers
were
by
an
esquire
palmer
then
the
principal
gentleman
in
that
parish
he
qualified
himself
for
the
business
of
scrivener
became
a
considerable
man
in
the
county
was
a
chief
mover
of
all
undertakings
for
the
county
or
town
of
northampton
and
his
own
village
of
which
many
instances
were
related
of
him
and
much
taken
notice
of
and
patronized
by
the
then
lord
halifax
he
died
in
january
old
style
just
four
years
to
a
day
before
i
was
born
the
account
we
received
of
his
life
and
character
from
some
old
people
at
ecton
i
remember
struck
you
as
something
extraordinary
from
its
similarity
to
what
you
knew
of
mine
had
he
died
on
the
same
day
you
said
one
might
have
supposed
a
transmigration
john
was
bred
a
dyer
i
believe
of
woolens
benjamin
was
bred
a
silk
dyer
serving
an
apprenticeship
at
london
he
was
an
ingenious
man
i
remember
him
well
for
when
i
was
a
boy
he
came
over
to
my
father
in
boston
and
lived
in
the
house
with
us
some
years
he
lived
to
a
great
age
his
grandson
samuel
franklin
now
lives
in
boston
he
left
behind
him
two
quarto
volumes
of
his
own
poetry
consisting
of
little
occasional
pieces
addressed
to
his
friends
and
relations
of
which
the
following
sent
to
me
is
a
specimen
he
had
formed
a
of
his
own
which
he
taught
me
but
never
practising
it
i
have
now
forgot
it
i
was
named
after
this
uncle
there
being
a
particular
affection
between
him
and
my
father
he
was
very
pious
a
great
attender
of
sermons
of
the
best
preachers
which
he
took
down
in
his
and
had
with
him
many
volumes
of
them
he
was
also
much
of
a
politician
too
much
perhaps
for
his
station
there
fell
lately
into
my
hands
in
london
a
collection
he
had
made
of
all
the
principal
pamphlets
relating
to
public
affairs
from
to
many
of
the
volumes
are
wanting
as
appears
by
the
numbering
but
there
still
remain
eight
volumes
in
folio
and
in
quarto
and
in
octavo
a
dealer
in
old
books
met
with
them
and
knowing
me
by
my
sometimes
buying
of
him
he
brought
them
to
me
it
seems
my
uncle
must
have
left
them
here
when
he
went
to
america
which
was
about
fifty
years
since
there
are
many
of
his
notes
in
the
margins
here
follow
in
the
margin
the
words
in
brackets
here
insert
it
but
the
poetry
is
not
given
sparks
informs
us
life
of
franklin
that
these
volumes
had
been
preserved
and
were
in
possession
of
emmons
of
boston
of
their
author
this
obscure
family
of
ours
was
early
in
the
reformation
and
continued
protestants
through
the
reign
of
queen
mary
when
they
were
sometimes
in
danger
of
trouble
on
account
of
their
zeal
against
popery
they
had
got
an
english
bible
and
to
conceal
and
secure
it
it
was
fastened
open
with
tapes
under
and
within
the
cover
of
a
when
my
read
it
to
his
family
he
turned
up
the
upon
his
knees
turning
over
the
leaves
then
under
the
tapes
one
of
the
children
stood
at
the
door
to
give
notice
if
he
saw
the
apparitor
coming
who
was
an
officer
of
the
spiritual
court
in
that
case
the
stool
was
turned
down
again
upon
its
feet
when
the
bible
remained
concealed
under
it
as
before
this
anecdote
i
had
from
my
uncle
benjamin
the
family
continued
all
of
the
church
of
england
till
about
the
end
of
charles
the
second
reign
when
some
of
the
ministers
that
had
been
outed
for
nonconformity
holding
conventicles
in
northamptonshire
benjamin
and
josiah
adhered
to
them
and
so
continued
all
their
lives
the
rest
of
the
family
remained
with
the
episcopal
church
josiah
my
father
married
young
and
carried
his
wife
with
three
children
into
new
england
about
the
conventicles
having
been
forbidden
by
law
and
frequently
disturbed
induced
some
considerable
men
of
his
acquaintance
to
remove
to
that
country
and
he
was
prevailed
with
to
accompany
them
thither
where
they
expected
to
enjoy
their
mode
of
religion
with
freedom
by
the
same
wife
he
had
four
children
more
born
there
and
by
a
second
wife
ten
more
in
all
seventeen
of
which
i
remember
thirteen
sitting
at
one
time
at
his
table
who
all
grew
up
to
be
men
and
women
and
married
i
was
the
youngest
son
and
the
youngest
child
but
two
and
was
born
in
boston
new
england
my
mother
the
second
wife
was
abiah
folger
daughter
of
peter
folger
one
of
the
first
settlers
of
new
england
of
whom
honorable
mention
is
made
by
cotton
mather
in
his
church
history
of
that
country
entitled
magnalia
christi
americana
as
a
godly
learned
englishman
if
i
remember
the
words
rightly
i
have
heard
that
he
wrote
sundry
small
occasional
pieces
but
only
one
of
them
was
printed
which
i
saw
now
many
years
since
it
was
written
in
in
the
verse
of
that
time
and
people
and
addressed
to
those
then
concerned
in
the
government
there
it
was
in
favor
of
liberty
of
conscience
and
in
behalf
of
the
baptists
quakers
and
other
sectaries
that
had
been
under
persecution
ascribing
the
indian
wars
and
other
distresses
that
had
befallen
the
country
to
that
persecution
as
so
many
judgments
of
god
to
punish
so
heinous
an
offense
and
exhorting
a
repeal
of
those
uncharitable
laws
the
whole
appeared
to
me
as
written
with
a
good
deal
of
decent
plainness
and
manly
freedom
the
six
concluding
lines
i
remember
though
i
have
forgotten
the
two
first
of
the
stanza
but
the
purport
of
them
was
that
his
censures
proceeded
from
and
therefore
he
would
be
known
to
be
the
author
because
to
be
a
libeller
says
he
i
hate
it
with
my
heart
from
sherburne
town
where
now
i
dwell
my
name
i
do
put
here
without
offense
your
real
friend
it
is
peter
folgier
my
elder
brothers
were
all
put
apprentices
to
different
trades
i
was
put
to
the
at
eight
years
of
age
my
father
intending
to
devote
me
as
the
tithe
of
his
sons
to
the
service
of
the
church
my
early
readiness
in
learning
to
read
which
must
have
been
very
early
as
i
do
not
remember
when
i
could
not
read
and
the
opinion
of
all
his
friends
that
i
should
certainly
make
a
good
scholar
encouraged
him
in
this
purpose
of
his
my
uncle
benjamin
too
approved
of
it
and
proposed
to
give
me
all
his
volumes
of
sermons
i
suppose
as
a
stock
to
set
up
with
if
i
would
learn
his
character
i
continued
however
at
the
not
quite
one
year
though
in
that
time
i
had
risen
gradually
from
the
middle
of
the
class
of
that
year
to
be
the
head
of
it
and
farther
was
removed
into
the
next
class
above
it
in
order
to
go
with
that
into
the
third
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
my
father
in
the
meantime
from
a
view
of
the
expense
of
a
college
education
which
having
so
large
a
family
he
could
not
well
afford
and
the
mean
living
many
so
educated
were
afterwards
able
to
obtain
reasons
that
he
gave
to
his
friends
in
my
hearing
altered
his
first
intention
took
me
from
the
and
sent
me
to
a
school
for
writing
and
arithmetic
kept
by
a
then
famous
man
george
brownell
very
successful
in
his
profession
generally
and
that
by
mild
encouraging
methods
under
him
i
acquired
fair
writing
pretty
soon
but
i
failed
in
the
arithmetic
and
made
no
progress
in
it
at
ten
years
old
i
was
taken
home
to
assist
my
father
in
his
business
which
was
that
of
a
and
a
business
he
was
not
bred
to
but
had
assumed
on
his
arrival
in
new
england
and
on
finding
his
dying
trade
would
not
maintain
his
family
being
in
little
request
accordingly
i
was
employed
in
cutting
wick
for
the
candles
filling
the
dipping
mold
and
the
molds
for
cast
candles
attending
the
shop
going
of
errands
etc
i
disliked
the
trade
and
had
a
strong
inclination
for
the
sea
but
my
father
declared
against
it
however
living
near
the
water
i
was
much
in
and
about
it
learnt
early
to
swim
well
and
to
manage
boats
and
when
in
a
boat
or
canoe
with
other
boys
i
was
commonly
allowed
to
govern
especially
in
any
case
of
difficulty
and
upon
other
occasions
i
was
generally
a
leader
among
the
boys
and
sometimes
led
them
into
scrapes
of
which
i
will
mention
one
instance
as
it
shows
an
early
projecting
public
spirit
tho
not
then
justly
conducted
there
was
a
that
bounded
part
of
the
on
the
edge
of
which
at
high
water
we
used
to
stand
to
fish
for
minnows
by
much
trampling
we
had
made
it
a
mere
quagmire
my
proposal
was
to
build
a
wharff
there
fit
for
us
to
stand
upon
and
i
showed
my
comrades
a
large
heap
of
stones
which
were
intended
for
a
new
house
near
the
marsh
and
which
would
very
well
suit
our
purpose
accordingly
in
the
evening
when
the
workmen
were
gone
i
assembled
a
number
of
my
and
working
with
them
diligently
like
so
many
emmets
sometimes
two
or
three
to
a
stone
we
brought
them
all
away
and
built
our
little
wharff
the
next
morning
the
workmen
were
surprised
at
missing
the
stones
which
were
found
in
our
wharff
inquiry
was
made
after
the
removers
we
were
discovered
and
complained
of
several
of
us
were
corrected
by
our
fathers
and
though
i
pleaded
the
usefulness
of
the
work
mine
convinced
me
that
nothing
was
useful
which
was
not
honest
i
think
you
may
like
to
know
something
of
his
person
and
character
he
had
an
excellent
constitution
of
body
was
of
middle
stature
but
well
set
and
very
strong
he
was
ingenious
could
draw
prettily
was
skilled
a
little
in
music
and
had
a
clear
pleasing
voice
so
that
when
he
played
psalm
tunes
on
his
violin
and
sung
withal
as
he
sometimes
did
in
an
evening
after
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
it
was
extremely
agreeable
to
hear
he
had
a
mechanical
genius
too
and
on
occasion
was
very
handy
in
the
use
of
other
tradesmen
tools
but
his
great
excellence
lay
in
a
sound
understanding
and
solid
judgment
in
prudential
matters
both
in
private
and
publick
affairs
in
the
latter
indeed
he
was
never
employed
the
numerous
family
he
had
to
educate
and
the
straitness
of
his
circumstances
keeping
him
close
to
his
trade
but
i
remember
well
his
being
frequently
visited
by
leading
people
who
consulted
him
for
his
opinion
in
affairs
of
the
town
or
of
the
church
he
belonged
to
and
showed
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
his
judgment
and
advice
he
was
also
much
consulted
by
private
persons
about
their
affairs
when
any
difficulty
occurred
and
frequently
chosen
an
arbitrator
between
contending
parties
at
his
table
he
liked
to
have
as
often
as
he
could
some
sensible
friend
or
neighbor
to
converse
with
and
always
took
care
to
start
some
ingenious
or
useful
topic
for
discourse
which
might
tend
to
improve
the
minds
of
his
children
by
this
means
he
turned
our
attention
to
what
was
good
just
and
prudent
in
the
conduct
of
life
and
little
or
no
notice
was
ever
taken
of
what
related
to
the
victuals
on
the
table
whether
it
was
well
or
ill
dressed
in
or
out
of
season
of
good
or
bad
flavor
preferable
or
inferior
to
this
or
that
other
thing
of
the
kind
so
that
i
was
up
in
such
a
perfect
inattention
to
those
matters
as
to
be
quite
indifferent
what
kind
of
food
was
set
before
me
and
so
unobservant
of
it
that
to
this
day
if
i
am
asked
i
can
scarce
tell
a
few
hours
after
dinner
what
i
dined
upon
this
has
been
a
convenience
to
me
in
travelling
where
my
companions
have
been
sometimes
very
unhappy
for
want
of
a
suitable
gratification
of
their
more
delicate
because
better
instructed
tastes
and
appetites
my
mother
had
likewise
an
excellent
constitution
she
suckled
all
her
ten
children
i
never
knew
either
my
father
or
mother
to
have
any
sickness
but
that
of
which
they
dy
he
at
and
she
at
years
of
age
they
lie
buried
together
at
boston
where
i
some
years
since
placed
a
marble
over
their
grave
with
this
inscription
josiah
franklin
and
abiah
his
wife
lie
here
interred
they
lived
lovingly
together
in
wedlock
years
without
an
estate
or
any
gainful
employment
by
constant
labor
and
industry
with

they
maintained
a
large
family
comfortably
and
brought
up
thirteen
children
and
seven
grandchildren

this
stone
born

ætat
born
died
by
my
rambling
digressions
i
perceive
myself
to
be
grown
old
i
us
to
write
more
methodically
but
one
does
not
dress
for
private
company
as
for
a
publick
ball
is
perhaps
only
negligence
to
return
i
continued
thus
employed
in
my
father
business
for
two
years
that
is
till
i
was
twelve
years
old
and
my
brother
john
who
was
bred
to
that
business
having
left
my
father
married
and
set
up
for
himself
at
rhode
island
there
was
all
appearance
that
i
was
destined
to
supply
his
place
and
become
a
but
my
dislike
to
the
trade
continuing
my
father
was
under
apprehensions
that
if
he
did
not
find
one
for
me
more
agreeable
i
should
break
away
and
get
to
sea
as
his
son
josiah
had
done
to
his
great
vexation
he
therefore
sometimes
took
me
to
walk
with
him
and
see
joiners
bricklayers
turners
braziers
at
their
work
that
he
might
observe
my
inclination
and
endeavor
to
fix
it
on
some
trade
or
other
on
land
it
has
ever
since
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
good
workmen
handle
their
tools
and
it
has
been
useful
to
me
having
learnt
so
much
by
it
as
to
be
able
to
do
little
jobs
myself
in
my
house
when
a
workman
could
not
readily
be
got
and
to
construct
little
machines
for
my
experiments
while
the
intention
of
making
the
experiment
was
fresh
and
warm
in
my
mind
my
father
at
last
fixed
upon
the
cutler
trade
and
my
uncle
benjamin
son
samuel
who
was
bred
to
that
business
in
london
being
about
that
time
established
in
boston
i
was
sent
to
be
with
him
some
time
on
liking
but
his
expectations
of
a
fee
with
me
displeasing
my
father
i
was
taken
home
again
from
a
child
i
was
fond
of
reading
and
all
the
little
money
that
came
into
my
hands
was
ever
laid
out
in
books
pleased
with
the
progress
my
first
collection
was
of
john
bunyan
works
in
separate
little
volumes
i
afterward
sold
them
to
enable
me
to
buy
historical
collections
they
were
small
chapmen
books
and
cheap
or
in
all
my
father
little
library
consisted
chiefly
of
books
in
polemic
divinity
most
of
which
i
read
and
have
since
often
regretted
that
at
a
time
when
i
had
such
a
thirst
for
knowledge
more
proper
books
had
not
fallen
in
my
way
since
it
was
now
resolved
i
should
not
be
a
clergyman
plutarch
lives
there
was
in
which
i
read
abundantly
and
i
still
think
that
time
spent
to
great
advantage
there
was
also
a
book
of
de
foe
called
an
essay
on
projects
and
another
of
mather
called
essays
to
do
good
which
perhaps
gave
me
a
turn
of
thinking
that
had
an
influence
on
some
of
the
principal
future
events
of
my
life
this
bookish
inclination
at
length
determined
my
father
to
make
me
a
printer
though
he
had
already
one
son
james
of
that
profession
in
my
brother
james
returned
from
england
with
a
press
and
letters
to
set
up
his
business
in
boston
i
liked
it
much
better
than
that
of
my
father
but
still
had
a
hankering
for
the
sea
to
prevent
the
apprehended
effect
of
such
an
inclination
my
father
was
impatient
to
have
me
bound
to
my
brother
i
stood
out
some
time
but
at
last
was
persuaded
and
signed
the
indentures
when
i
was
yet
but
twelve
years
old
i
was
to
serve
as
an
apprentice
till
i
was
years
of
age
only
i
was
to
be
allowed
journeyman
wages
during
the
last
year
in
a
little
time
i
made
great
proficiency
in
the
business
and
became
a
useful
hand
to
my
brother
i
now
had
access
to
better
books
an
acquaintance
with
the
apprentices
of
booksellers
enabled
me
sometimes
to
borrow
a
small
one
which
i
was
careful
to
return
soon
and
clean
often
i
sat
up
in
my
room
reading
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
when
the
book
was
borrowed
in
the
evening
and
to
be
returned
early
in
the
morning
lest
it
should
be
missed
or
wanted
and
after
some
time
an
ingenious
tradesman
matthew
adams
who
had
a
pretty
collection
of
books
and
who
frequented
our
took
notice
of
me
invited
me
to
his
library
and
very
kindly
lent
me
such
books
as
i
chose
to
read
i
now
took
a
fancy
to
poetry
and
made
some
little
pieces
my
brother
thinking
it
might
turn
to
account
encouraged
me
and
put
me
on
composing
occasional
ballads
one
was
called
the
lighthouse
tragedy
and
contained
an
account
of
the
drowning
of
captain
worthilake
with
his
two
daughters
the
other
was
a
sailor
song
on
the
taking
of
teach
or
blackbeard
the
pirate
they
were
wretched
stuff
in
the
style
and
when
they
were
printed
he
sent
me
about
the
town
to
sell
them
the
first
sold
wonderfully
the
event
being
recent
having
made
a
great
noise
this
flattered
my
vanity
but
my
father
discouraged
me
by
ridiculing
my
performances
and
telling
me
were
generally
beggars
so
i
escaped
being
a
poet
most
probably
a
very
bad
one
but
as
prose
writing
had
been
of
great
use
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
was
a
principal
means
of
my
advancement
i
shall
tell
you
how
in
such
a
situation
i
acquired
what
little
ability
i
have
in
that
way
there
was
another
bookish
lad
in
the
town
john
collins
by
name
with
whom
i
was
intimately
acquainted
we
sometimes
disputed
and
very
fond
we
were
of
argument
and
very
desirous
of
confuting
one
another
which
disputatious
turn
by
the
way
is
apt
to
become
a
very
bad
habit
making
people
often
extremely
disagreeable
in
company
by
the
contradiction
that
is
necessary
to
bring
it
into
practice
and
thence
besides
souring
and
spoiling
the
conversation
is
productive
of
disgusts
and
perhaps
enmities
where
you
may
have
occasion
for
friendship
i
had
caught
it
by
reading
my
father
books
of
dispute
about
religion
persons
of
good
sense
i
have
since
observed
seldom
fall
into
it
except
lawyers
university
men
and
men
of
all
sorts
that
have
been
bred
at
edinborough
a
question
was
once
somehow
or
other
started
between
collins
and
me
of
the
propriety
of
educating
the
female
sex
in
learning
and
their
abilities
for
study
he
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
improper
and
that
they
were
naturally
unequal
to
it
i
took
the
contrary
side
perhaps
a
little
for
dispute
sake
he
was
naturally
more
eloquent
had
a
ready
plenty
of
words
and
sometimes
as
i
thought
bore
me
down
more
by
his
fluency
than
by
the
strength
of
his
reasons
as
we
parted
without
settling
the
point
and
were
not
to
see
one
another
again
for
some
time
i
sat
down
to
put
my
arguments
in
writing
which
i
copied
fair
and
sent
to
him
he
answered
and
i
replied
three
or
four
letters
of
a
side
had
passed
when
my
father
happened
to
find
my
papers
and
read
them
without
entering
into
the
discussion
he
took
occasion
to
talk
to
me
about
the
manner
of
my
writing
observed
that
though
i
had
the
advantage
of
my
antagonist
in
correct
spelling
and
pointing
which
i
ow
to
the
i
fell
far
short
in
elegance
of
expression
in
method
and
in
perspicuity
of
which
he
convinced
me
by
several
instances
i
saw
the
justice
of
his
remark
and
thence
grew
more
attentive
to
the
manner
in
writing
and
determined
to
endeavor
at
improvement
about
this
time
i
met
with
an
odd
volume
of
the
spectator
it
was
the
third
i
had
never
before
seen
any
of
them
i
bought
it
read
it
over
and
over
and
was
much
delighted
with
it
i
thought
the
writing
excellent
and
wished
if
possible
to
imitate
it
with
this
view
i
took
some
of
the
papers
and
making
short
hints
of
the
sentiment
in
each
sentence
laid
them
by
a
few
days
and
then
without
looking
at
the
book
try
to
compleat
the
papers
again
by
expressing
each
hinted
sentiment
at
length
and
as
fully
as
it
had
been
expressed
before
in
any
suitable
words
that
should
come
to
hand
then
i
compared
my
spectator
with
the
original
discovered
some
of
my
faults
and
corrected
them
but
i
found
i
wanted
a
stock
of
words
or
a
readiness
in
recollecting
and
using
them
which
i
thought
i
should
have
acquired
before
that
time
if
i
had
gone
on
making
verses
since
the
continual
occasion
for
words
of
the
same
import
but
of
different
length
to
suit
the
measure
or
of
different
sound
for
the
rhyme
would
have
laid
me
under
a
constant
necessity
of
searching
for
variety
and
also
have
tended
to
fix
that
variety
in
my
mind
and
make
me
master
of
it
therefore
i
took
some
of
the
tales
and
turned
them
into
verse
and
after
a
time
when
i
had
pretty
well
forgotten
the
prose
turned
them
back
again
i
also
sometimes
jumbled
my
collections
of
hints
into
confusion
and
after
some
weeks
endeavored
to
reduce
them
into
the
best
order
before
i
began
to
form
the
full
sentences
and
compleat
the
paper
this
was
to
teach
me
method
in
the
arrangement
of
thoughts
by
comparing
my
work
afterwards
with
the
original
i
discovered
many
faults
and
amended
them
but
i
sometimes
had
the
pleasure
of
fancying
that
in
certain
particulars
of
small
import
i
had
been
lucky
enough
to
improve
the
method
or
the
language
and
this
encouraged
me
to
think
i
might
possibly
in
time
come
to
be
a
tolerable
english
writer
of
which
i
was
extremely
ambitious
my
time
for
these
exercises
and
for
reading
was
at
night
after
work
or
before
it
began
in
the
morning
or
on
sundays
when
i
contrived
to
be
in
the
alone
evading
as
much
as
i
could
the
common
attendance
on
public
worship
which
my
father
used
to
exact
on
me
when
i
was
under
his
care
and
which
indeed
i
still
thought
a
duty
though
i
could
not
as
it
seemed
to
me
afford
time
to
practise
it
when
about
years
of
age
i
happened
to
meet
with
a
book
written
by
one
tryon
recommending
a
vegetable
diet
i
determined
to
go
into
it
my
brother
being
yet
unmarried
did
not
keep
house
but
boarded
himself
and
his
apprentices
in
another
family
my
refusing
to
eat
flesh
occasioned
an
inconveniency
and
i
was
frequently
chid
for
my
singularity
i
made
myself
acquainted
with
tryon
manner
of
preparing
some
of
his
dishes
such
as
boiling
potatoes
or
rice
making
hasty
pudding
and
a
few
others
and
then
proposed
to
my
brother
that
if
he
would
give
me
weekly
half
the
money
he
paid
for
my
board
i
would
board
myself
he
instantly
agreed
to
it
and
i
presently
found
that
i
could
save
half
what
he
paid
me
this
was
an
additional
fund
for
buying
books
but
i
had
another
advantage
in
it
my
brother
and
the
rest
going
from
the
to
their
meals
i
remained
there
alone
and
despatching
presently
my
light
repast
which
often
was
no
more
than
a
bisket
or
a
slice
of
bread
a
handful
of
raisins
or
a
tart
from
the
and
a
glass
of
water
had
the
rest
of
the
time
till
their
return
for
study
in
which
i
made
the
greater
progress
from
that
greater
clearness
of
head
and
quicker
apprehension
which
usually
attend
temperance
in
eating
and
drinking
and
now
it
was
that
being
on
some
occasion
made
asham
of
my
ignorance
in
figures
which
i
had
twice
failed
in
learning
when
at
school
i
took
cocker
book
of
arithmetick
and
went
through
the
whole
by
myself
with
great
ease
i
also
read
seller
and
shermy
books
of
navigation
and
became
acquainted
with
the
little
geometry
they
contain
but
never
proceeded
far
in
that
science
and
i
read
about
this
time
locke
on
human
understanding
and
the
art
of
thinking
by
du
port
royal
while
i
was
intent
on
improving
my
language
i
met
with
an
english
grammar
i
think
it
was
greenwood
at
the
end
of
which
there
were
two
little
sketches
of
the
arts
of
rhetoric
and
logic
the
latter
finishing
with
a
specimen
of
a
dispute
in
the
socratic
method
and
soon
after
i
procur
xenophon
memorable
things
of
socrates
wherein
there
are
many
instances
of
the
same
method
i
was
charm
with
it
adopted
it
dropt
my
abrupt
contradiction
and
positive
argumentation
and
put
on
the
humble
inquirer
and
doubter
and
being
then
from
reading
shaftesbury
and
collins
become
a
real
doubter
in
many
points
of
our
religious
doctrine
i
found
this
method
safest
for
myself
and
very
embarrassing
to
those
against
whom
i
used
it
therefore
i
took
a
delight
in
it
practis
it
continually
and
grew
very
artful
and
expert
in
drawing
people
even
of
superior
knowledge
into
concessions
the
consequences
of
which
they
did
not
foresee
entangling
them
in
difficulties
out
of
which
they
could
not
extricate
themselves
and
so
obtaining
victories
that
neither
myself
nor
my
cause
always
deserved
i
continu
this
method
some
few
years
but
gradually
left
it
retaining
only
the
habit
of
expressing
myself
in
terms
of
modest
diffidence
never
using
when
i
advanced
any
thing
that
may
possibly
be
disputed
the
words
certainly
undoubtedly
or
any
others
that
give
the
air
of
positiveness
to
an
opinion
but
rather
say
i
conceive
or
apprehend
a
thing
to
be
so
and
so
it
appears
to
me
or
i
should
think
it
so
or
so
for
such
and
such
reasons
or
i
imagine
it
to
be
so
or
it
is
so
if
i
am
not
mistaken
this
habit
i
believe
has
been
of
great
advantage
to
me
when
i
have
had
occasion
to
inculcate
my
opinions
and
persuade
men
into
measures
that
i
have
been
from
time
to
time
engag
in
promoting
and
as
the
chief
ends
of
conversation
are
to
inform
or
to
be
informed
to
please
or
to
persuade
i
wish
sensible
men
would
not
lessen
their
power
of
doing
good
by
a
positive
assuming
manner
that
seldom
fails
to
disgust
tends
to
create
opposition
and
to
defeat
every
one
of
those
purposes
for
which
speech
was
given
to
us
to
wit
giving
or
receiving
information
or
pleasure
for
if
you
would
inform
a
positive
and
dogmatical
manner
in
advancing
your
sentiments
may
provoke
contradiction
and
prevent
a
candid
attention
if
you
wish
information
and
improvement
from
the
knowledge
of
others
and
yet
at
the
same
time
express
yourself
as
firmly
fix
in
your
present
opinions
modest
sensible
men
who
do
not
love
disputation
will
probably
leave
you
undisturbed
in
the
possession
of
your
error
and
by
such
a
manner
you
can
seldom
hope
to
recommend
yourself
in
pleasing
your
hearers
or
to
persuade
those
whose
concurrence
you
desire
pope
says
judiciously
men
should
be
taught
as
if
you
taught
them
not
and
things
unknown
propos
as
things
forgot
farther
recommending
to
us
to
speak
tho
sure
with
seeming
diffidence
and
he
might
have
coupled
with
this
line
that
which
he
has
coupled
with
another
i
think
less
properly
for
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
if
you
ask
why
less
properly
i
must
repeat
the
lines
immodest
words
admit
of
no
defense
for
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
now
is
not
want
of
sense
where
a
man
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
want
it
some
apology
for
his
want
of
modesty
and
would
not
the
lines
stand
more
justly
thus
immodest
words
admit
but
this
defense
that
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
this
however
i
should
submit
to
better
judgments
my
brother
had
in
or
begun
to
print
a
newspaper
it
was
the
second
that
appeared
in
america
and
was
called
the
new
england
courant
the
only
one
before
it
was
the
boston
i
remember
his
being
dissuaded
by
some
of
his
friends
from
the
undertaking
as
not
likely
to
succeed
one
newspaper
being
in
their
judgment
enough
for
america
at
this
time
there
are
not
less
than
he
went
on
however
with
the
undertaking
and
after
having
worked
in
composing
the
types
and
printing
off
the
sheets
i
was
employed
to
carry
the
papers
thro
the
streets
to
the
customers
he
had
some
ingenious
men
among
his
friends
who
amus
themselves
by
writing
little
pieces
for
this
paper
which
gain
it
credit
and
made
it
more
in
demand
and
these
gentlemen
often
visited
us
hearing
their
conversations
and
their
accounts
of
the
approbation
their
papers
were
received
with
i
was
excited
to
try
my
hand
among
them
but
being
still
a
boy
and
suspecting
that
my
brother
would
object
to
printing
anything
of
mine
in
his
paper
if
he
knew
it
to
be
mine
i
contrived
to
disguise
my
hand
and
writing
an
anonymous
paper
i
put
it
in
at
night
under
the
door
of
the
it
was
found
in
the
morning
and
communicated
to
his
writing
friends
when
they
call
in
as
usual
they
read
it
commented
on
it
in
my
hearing
and
i
had
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
finding
it
met
with
their
approbation
and
that
in
their
different
guesses
at
the
author
none
were
named
but
men
of
some
character
among
us
for
learning
and
ingenuity
i
suppose
now
that
i
was
rather
lucky
in
my
judges
and
that
perhaps
they
were
not
really
so
very
good
ones
as
i
then
esteem
them
encourag
however
by
this
i
wrote
and
convey
in
the
same
way
to
the
press
several
more
papers
which
were
equally
approv
and
i
kept
my
secret
till
my
small
fund
of
sense
for
such
performances
was
pretty
well
exhausted
and
then
i
discovered
it
when
i
began
to
be
considered
a
little
more
by
my
brother
acquaintance
and
in
a
manner
that
did
not
quite
please
him
as
he
thought
probably
with
reason
that
it
tended
to
make
me
too
vain
and
perhaps
this
might
be
one
occasion
of
the
differences
that
we
began
to
have
about
this
time
though
a
brother
he
considered
himself
as
my
master
and
me
as
his
apprentice
and
accordingly
expected
the
same
services
from
me
as
he
would
from
another
while
i
thought
he
demean
me
too
much
in
some
he
requir
of
me
who
from
a
brother
expected
more
indulgence
our
disputes
were
often
brought
before
our
father
and
i
fancy
i
was
either
generally
in
the
right
or
else
a
better
pleader
because
the
judgment
was
generally
in
my
favor
but
my
brother
was
passionate
and
had
often
beaten
me
which
i
took
extreamly
amiss
and
thinking
my
apprenticeship
very
tedious
i
was
continually
wishing
for
some
opportunity
of
shortening
it
which
at
length
offered
in
a
manner
unexpected
i
fancy
his
harsh
and
tyrannical
treatment
of
me
might
be
a
means
of
impressing
me
with
that
aversion
to
arbitrary
power
that
has
stuck
to
me
through
my
whole
life
one
of
the
pieces
in
our
newspaper
on
some
political
point
which
i
have
now
forgotten
gave
offense
to
the
assembly
he
was
taken
up
censur
and
imprison
for
a
month
by
the
speaker
warrant
i
suppose
because
he
would
not
discover
his
author
i
too
was
taken
up
and
examin
before
the
council
but
tho
i
did
not
give
them
any
satisfaction
they
content
themselves
with
admonishing
me
and
dismissed
me
considering
me
perhaps
as
an
apprentice
who
was
bound
to
keep
his
secrets
during
my
brother
confinement
which
i
resented
a
good
deal
notwithstanding
our
private
differences
i
had
the
management
of
the
paper
and
i
made
bold
to
give
our
rulers
some
rubs
in
it
which
my
brother
took
very
kindly
while
others
began
to
consider
me
in
an
unfavorable
light
as
a
young
genius
that
had
a
turn
for
libelling
and
satyr
my
brother
discharge
was
accompany
with
an
order
of
the
house
a
very
odd
one
that
james
franklin
should
no
longer
print
the
paper
called
the
new
england
courant
there
was
a
consultation
held
in
our
among
his
friends
what
he
should
do
in
this
case
some
proposed
to
evade
the
order
by
changing
the
name
of
the
paper
but
my
brother
seeing
inconveniences
in
that
it
was
finally
concluded
on
as
a
better
way
to
let
it
be
printed
for
the
future
under
the
name
of
benjamin
franklin
and
to
avoid
the
censure
of
the
assembly
that
might
fall
on
him
as
still
printing
it
by
his
apprentice
the
contrivance
was
that
my
old
indenture
should
be
return
to
me
with
a
full
discharge
on
the
back
of
it
to
be
shown
on
occasion
but
to
secure
to
him
the
benefit
of
my
service
i
was
to
sign
new
indentures
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
which
were
to
be
kept
private
a
very
flimsy
scheme
it
was
however
it
was
immediately
executed
and
the
paper
went
on
accordingly
under
my
name
for
several
months
at
length
a
fresh
difference
arising
between
my
brother
and
me
i
took
upon
me
to
assert
my
freedom
presuming
that
he
would
not
venture
to
produce
the
new
indentures
it
was
not
fair
in
me
to
take
this
advantage
and
this
i
therefore
reckon
one
of
the
first
errata
of
my
life
but
the
unfairness
of
it
weighed
little
with
me
when
under
the
impressions
of
resentment
for
the
blows
his
passion
too
often
urged
him
to
bestow
upon
me
though
he
was
otherwise
not
an
man
perhaps
i
was
too
saucy
and
provoking
when
he
found
i
would
leave
him
he
took
care
to
prevent
my
getting
employment
in
any
other
of
the
town
by
going
round
and
speaking
to
every
master
who
accordingly
refus
to
give
me
work
i
then
thought
of
going
to
new
york
as
the
nearest
place
where
there
was
a
printer
and
i
was
rather
inclin
to
leave
boston
when
i
reflected
that
i
had
already
made
myself
a
little
obnoxious
to
the
governing
party
and
from
the
arbitrary
proceedings
of
the
assembly
in
my
brother
case
it
was
likely
i
might
if
i
stay
soon
bring
myself
into
scrapes
and
farther
that
my
indiscrete
disputations
about
religion
began
to
make
me
pointed
at
with
horror
by
good
people
as
an
infidel
or
atheist
i
determin
on
the
point
but
my
father
now
siding
with
my
brother
i
was
sensible
that
if
i
attempted
to
go
openly
means
would
be
used
to
prevent
me
my
friend
collins
therefore
undertook
to
manage
a
little
for
me
he
agreed
with
the
captain
of
a
new
york
sloop
for
my
passage
under
the
notion
of
my
being
a
young
acquaintance
of
his
that
had
got
a
naughty
girl
with
child
whose
friends
would
compel
me
to
marry
her
and
therefore
i
could
not
appear
or
come
away
publicly
so
i
sold
some
of
my
books
to
raise
a
little
money
was
taken
on
board
privately
and
as
we
had
a
fair
wind
in
three
days
i
found
myself
in
new
york
near
miles
from
home
a
boy
of
but
without
the
least
recommendation
to
or
knowledge
of
any
person
in
the
place
and
with
very
little
money
in
my
pocket
my
inclinations
for
the
sea
were
by
this
time
worne
out
or
i
might
now
have
gratify
them
but
having
a
trade
and
supposing
myself
a
pretty
good
workman
i
offer
my
service
to
the
printer
in
the
place
old
william
bradford
who
had
been
the
first
printer
in
pennsylvania
but
removed
from
thence
upon
the
quarrel
of
george
keith
he
could
give
me
no
employment
having
little
to
do
and
help
enough
already
but
says
he
my
son
at
philadelphia
has
lately
lost
his
principal
hand
aquila
rose
by
death
if
you
go
thither
i
believe
he
may
employ
you
philadelphia
was
a
hundred
miles
further
i
set
out
however
in
a
boat
for
amboy
leaving
my
chest
and
things
to
follow
me
round
by
sea
in
crossing
the
bay
we
met
with
a
squall
that
tore
our
rotten
sails
to
pieces
prevented
our
getting
into
the
kill
and
drove
us
upon
long
island
in
our
way
a
drunken
dutchman
who
was
a
passenger
too
fell
overboard
when
he
was
sinking
i
reached
through
the
water
to
his
shock
pate
and
drew
him
up
so
that
we
got
him
in
again
his
ducking
sobered
him
a
little
and
he
went
to
sleep
taking
first
out
of
his
pocket
a
book
which
he
desir
i
would
dry
for
him
it
proved
to
be
my
old
favorite
author
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
in
dutch
finely
printed
on
good
paper
with
copper
cuts
a
dress
better
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
wear
in
its
own
language
i
have
since
found
that
it
has
been
translated
into
most
of
the
languages
of
europe
and
suppose
it
has
been
more
generally
read
than
any
other
book
except
perhaps
the
bible
honest
john
was
the
first
that
i
know
of
who
mix
narration
and
dialogue
a
method
of
writing
very
engaging
to
the
reader
who
in
the
most
interesting
parts
finds
himself
as
it
were
brought
into
the
company
and
present
at
the
discourse
de
foe
in
his
cruso
his
moll
flanders
religious
courtship
family
instructor
and
other
pieces
has
imitated
it
with
success
and
richardson
has
done
the
same
in
his
pamela
etc
when
we
drew
near
the
island
we
found
it
was
at
a
place
where
there
could
be
no
landing
there
being
a
great
surff
on
the
stony
beach
so
we
dropt
anchor
and
swung
round
towards
the
shore
some
people
came
down
to
the
water
edge
and
hallow
to
us
as
we
did
to
them
but
the
wind
was
so
high
and
the
surff
so
loud
that
we
could
not
hear
so
as
to
understand
each
other
there
were
canoes
on
the
shore
and
we
made
signs
and
hallow
that
they
should
fetch
us
but
they
either
did
not
understand
us
or
thought
it
impracticable
so
they
went
away
and
night
coming
on
we
had
no
remedy
but
to
wait
till
the
wind
should
abate
and
in
the
meantime
the
boatman
and
i
concluded
to
sleep
if
we
could
and
so
crowded
into
the
scuttle
with
the
dutchman
who
was
still
wet
and
the
spray
beating
over
the
head
of
our
boat
leak
thro
to
us
so
that
we
were
soon
almost
as
wet
as
he
in
this
manner
we
lay
all
night
with
very
little
rest
but
the
wind
abating
the
next
day
we
made
a
shift
to
reach
amboy
before
night
having
been
thirty
hours
on
the
water
without
victuals
or
any
drink
but
a
bottle
of
filthy
rum
and
the
water
we
sail
on
being
salt
in
the
evening
i
found
myself
very
feverish
and
went
in
to
bed
but
having
read
somewhere
that
cold
water
drank
plentifully
was
good
for
a
fever
i
follow
the
prescription
sweat
plentiful
most
of
the
night
my
fever
left
me
and
in
the
morning
crossing
the
ferry
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
on
foot
having
fifty
miles
to
burlington
where
i
was
told
i
should
find
boats
that
would
carry
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
philadelphia
it
rained
very
hard
all
the
day
i
was
thoroughly
soak
and
by
noon
a
good
deal
tired
so
i
stopt
at
a
poor
inn
where
i
staid
all
night
beginning
now
to
wish
that
i
had
never
left
home
i
cut
so
miserable
a
figure
too
that
i
found
by
the
questions
ask
me
i
was
suspected
to
be
some
runaway
servant
and
in
danger
of
being
taken
up
on
that
suspicion
however
i
proceeded
the
next
day
and
got
in
the
evening
to
an
inn
within
eight
or
ten
miles
of
burlington
kept
by
one
brown
he
entered
into
conversation
with
me
while
i
took
some
refreshment
and
finding
i
had
read
a
little
became
very
sociable
and
friendly
our
acquaintance
continu
as
long
as
he
liv
he
had
been
i
imagine
an
itinerant
doctor
for
there
was
no
town
in
england
or
country
in
europe
of
which
he
could
not
give
a
very
particular
account
he
had
some
letters
and
was
ingenious
but
much
of
an
unbeliever
and
wickedly
undertook
some
years
after
to
travestie
the
bible
in
doggrel
verse
as
cotton
had
done
virgil
by
this
means
he
set
many
of
the
facts
in
a
very
ridiculous
light
and
might
have
hurt
weak
minds
if
his
work
had
been
published
but
it
never
was
at
his
house
i
lay
that
night
and
the
next
morning
reach
burlington
but
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
the
regular
boats
were
gone
a
little
before
my
coming
and
no
other
expected
to
go
before
tuesday
this
being
saturday
wherefore
i
returned
to
an
old
woman
in
the
town
of
whom
i
had
bought
gingerbread
to
eat
on
the
water
and
ask
her
advice
she
invited
me
to
lodge
at
her
house
till
a
passage
by
water
should
offer
and
being
tired
with
my
foot
travelling
i
accepted
the
invitation
she
understanding
i
was
a
printer
would
have
had
me
stay
at
that
town
and
follow
my
business
being
ignorant
of
the
stock
necessary
to
begin
with
she
was
very
hospitable
gave
me
a
dinner
of
with
great
good
will
accepting
only
a
pot
of
ale
in
return
and
i
thought
myself
fixed
till
tuesday
should
come
however
walking
in
the
evening
by
the
side
of
the
river
a
boat
came
by
which
i
found
was
going
towards
philadelphia
with
several
people
in
her
they
took
me
in
and
as
there
was
no
wind
we
row
all
the
way
and
about
midnight
not
having
yet
seen
the
city
some
of
the
company
were
confident
we
must
have
passed
it
and
would
row
no
farther
the
others
knew
not
where
we
were
so
we
put
toward
the
shore
got
into
a
creek
landed
near
an
old
fence
with
the
rails
of
which
we
made
a
fire
the
night
being
cold
in
october
and
there
we
remained
till
daylight
then
one
of
the
company
knew
the
place
to
be
cooper
creek
a
little
above
philadelphia
which
we
saw
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
the
creek
and
arriv
there
about
eight
or
nine
on
the
sunday
morning
and
landed
at
the
wharf
i
have
been
the
more
particular
in
this
description
of
my
journey
and
shall
be
so
of
my
first
entry
into
that
city
that
you
may
in
your
mind
compare
such
unlikely
beginnings
with
the
figure
i
have
since
made
there
i
was
in
my
working
dress
my
best
cloaths
being
to
come
round
by
sea
i
was
dirty
from
my
journey
my
pockets
were
stuff
out
with
shirts
and
stockings
and
i
knew
no
soul
nor
where
to
look
for
lodging
i
was
fatigued
with
travelling
rowing
and
want
of
rest
i
was
very
hungry
and
my
whole
stock
of
cash
consisted
of
a
dutch
dollar
and
about
a
shilling
in
copper
the
latter
i
gave
the
people
of
the
boat
for
my
passage
who
at
first
refus
it
on
account
of
my
rowing
but
i
insisted
on
their
taking
it
a
man
being
sometimes
more
generous
when
he
has
but
a
little
money
than
when
he
has
plenty
perhaps
thro
fear
of
being
thought
to
have
but
little
then
i
walked
up
the
street
gazing
about
till
near
the
i
met
a
boy
with
bread
i
had
made
many
a
meal
on
bread
and
inquiring
where
he
got
it
i
went
immediately
to
the
baker
he
directed
me
to
in
and
ask
for
bisket
intending
such
as
we
had
in
boston
but
they
it
seems
were
not
made
in
philadelphia
then
i
asked
for
a
loaf
and
was
told
they
had
none
such
so
not
considering
or
knowing
the
difference
of
money
and
the
greater
cheapness
nor
the
names
of
his
bread
i
made
him
give
me
worth
of
any
sort
he
gave
me
accordingly
three
great
puffy
rolls
i
was
surpriz
at
the
quantity
but
took
it
and
having
no
room
in
my
pockets
walk
off
with
a
roll
under
each
arm
and
eating
the
other
thus
i
went
up
as
far
as
passing
by
the
door
of
read
my
future
wife
father
when
she
standing
at
the
door
saw
me
and
thought
i
made
as
i
certainly
did
a
most
awkward
ridiculous
appearance
then
i
turned
and
went
down
and
part
of
eating
my
roll
all
the
way
and
coming
round
found
myself
again
at
wharf
near
the
boat
i
came
in
to
which
i
went
for
a
draught
of
the
river
water
and
being
filled
with
one
of
my
rolls
gave
the
other
two
to
a
woman
and
her
child
that
came
down
the
river
in
the
boat
with
us
and
were
waiting
to
go
farther
thus
refreshed
i
walked
again
up
the
street
which
by
this
time
had
many
people
in
it
who
were
all
walking
the
same
way
i
joined
them
and
thereby
was
led
into
the
great
of
the
quakers
near
the
market
i
sat
down
among
them
and
after
looking
round
awhile
and
hearing
nothing
said
being
very
drowsy
thro
labor
and
want
of
rest
the
preceding
night
i
fell
fast
asleep
and
continued
so
till
the
meeting
broke
up
when
one
was
kind
enough
to
rouse
me
this
was
therefore
the
first
house
i
was
in
or
slept
in
in
philadelphia
walking
down
again
toward
the
river
and
looking
in
the
faces
of
people
i
met
a
young
quaker
man
whose
countenance
i
lik
and
accosting
him
requested
he
would
tell
me
where
a
stranger
could
get
lodging
we
were
then
near
the
sign
of
the
three
mariners
here
says
he
is
one
place
that
entertains
strangers
but
it
is
not
a
reputable
house
if
thee
wilt
walk
with
me
i
show
thee
a
better
he
brought
me
to
the
crooked
billet
in
here
i
got
a
dinner
and
while
i
was
eating
it
several
sly
questions
were
asked
me
as
it
seemed
to
be
suspected
from
my
youth
and
appearance
that
i
might
be
some
runaway
after
dinner
my
sleepiness
return
and
being
shown
to
a
bed
i
lay
down
without
undressing
and
slept
till
six
in
the
evening
was
to
supper
went
to
bed
again
very
early
and
slept
soundly
till
next
morning
then
i
made
myself
as
tidy
as
i
could
and
went
to
andrew
bradford
the
printer
i
found
in
the
shop
the
old
man
his
father
whom
i
had
seen
at
new
york
and
who
travelling
on
horseback
had
got
to
philadelphia
before
me
he
introduc
me
to
his
son
who
receiv
me
civilly
gave
me
a
breakfast
but
told
me
he
did
not
at
present
want
a
hand
being
lately
suppli
with
one
but
there
was
another
printer
in
town
lately
set
up
one
keimer
who
perhaps
might
employ
me
if
not
i
should
be
welcome
to
lodge
at
his
house
and
he
would
give
me
a
little
work
to
do
now
and
then
till
fuller
business
should
offer
the
old
gentleman
said
he
would
go
with
me
to
the
new
printer
and
when
we
found
him
neighbor
says
bradford
i
have
brought
to
see
you
a
young
man
of
your
business
perhaps
you
may
want
such
a
one
he
me
a
few
questions
put
a
composing
stick
in
my
hand
to
see
how
i
work
and
then
said
he
would
employ
me
soon
though
he
had
just
then
nothing
for
me
to
do
and
taking
old
bradford
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
to
be
one
of
the
town
people
that
had
a
good
will
for
him
enter
into
a
conversation
on
his
present
undertaking
and
prospects
while
bradford
not
discovering
that
he
was
the
other
printer
father
on
keimer
saying
he
expected
soon
to
get
the
greatest
part
of
the
business
into
his
own
hands
drew
him
on
by
artful
questions
and
starting
little
doubts
to
explain
all
his
views
what
interests
he
reli
on
and
in
what
manner
he
intended
to
proceed
i
who
stood
by
and
heard
all
saw
immediately
that
one
of
them
was
a
crafty
old
sophister
and
the
other
a
mere
novice
bradford
left
me
with
keimer
who
was
greatly
surpris
when
i
told
him
who
the
old
man
was
keimer
i
found
consisted
of
an
old
shatter
press
and
one
small
font
of
english
which
he
was
then
using
himself
composing
an
elegy
on
aquila
rose
before
mentioned
an
ingenious
young
man
of
excellent
character
much
respected
in
the
town
clerk
of
the
assembly
and
a
pretty
poet
keimer
made
verses
too
but
very
indifferently
he
could
not
be
said
to
write
them
for
his
manner
was
to
compose
them
in
the
types
directly
out
of
his
head
so
there
being
no
copy
but
one
pair
of
cases
and
the
elegy
likely
to
require
all
the
letter
no
one
could
help
him
i
endeavor
to
put
his
press
which
he
had
not
yet
us
and
of
which
he
understood
nothing
into
order
fit
to
be
work
with
and
promising
to
come
and
print
off
his
elegy
as
soon
as
he
should
have
got
it
ready
i
return
to
bradford
who
gave
me
a
little
job
to
do
for
the
present
and
there
i
lodged
and
dieted
a
few
days
after
keimer
sent
for
me
to
print
off
the
elegy
and
now
he
had
got
another
pair
of
cases
and
a
pamphlet
to
reprint
on
which
he
set
me
to
work
these
two
printers
i
found
poorly
qualified
for
their
business
bradford
had
not
been
bred
to
it
and
was
very
illiterate
and
keimer
something
of
a
scholar
was
a
mere
compositor
knowing
nothing
of
presswork
he
had
been
one
of
the
french
prophets
and
could
act
their
enthusiastic
agitations
at
this
time
he
did
not
profess
any
particular
religion
but
something
of
all
on
occasion
was
very
ignorant
of
the
world
and
had
as
i
afterward
found
a
good
deal
of
the
knave
in
his
composition
he
did
not
like
my
lodging
at
bradford
while
i
with
him
he
had
a
house
indeed
but
without
furniture
so
he
could
not
lodge
me
but
he
got
me
a
lodging
at
read
before
mentioned
who
was
the
owner
of
his
house
and
my
chest
and
clothes
being
come
by
this
time
i
made
rather
a
more
respectable
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
miss
read
than
i
had
done
when
she
first
happen
to
see
me
eating
my
roll
in
the
street
i
began
now
to
have
some
acquaintance
among
the
young
people
of
the
town
that
were
lovers
of
reading
with
whom
i
spent
my
evenings
very
pleasantly
and
gaining
money
by
my
industry
and
frugality
i
lived
very
agreeably
forgetting
boston
as
much
as
i
could
and
not
desiring
that
any
there
should
know
where
i
resided
except
my
friend
collins
who
was
in
my
secret
and
kept
it
when
i
wrote
to
him
at
length
an
incident
happened
that
sent
me
back
again
much
sooner
than
i
had
intended
i
had
a
robert
holmes
master
of
a
sloop
that
traded
between
boston
and
delaware
he
being
at
newcastle
forty
miles
below
philadelphia
heard
there
of
me
and
wrote
me
a
letter
mentioning
the
concern
of
my
friends
in
boston
at
my
abrupt
departure
assuring
me
of
their
good
will
to
me
and
that
every
thing
would
be
accommodated
to
my
mind
if
i
would
return
to
which
he
exhorted
me
very
earnestly
i
wrote
an
answer
to
his
letter
thank
him
for
his
advice
but
stated
my
reasons
for
quitting
boston
fully
and
in
such
a
light
as
to
convince
him
i
was
not
so
wrong
as
he
had
apprehended
sir
william
keith
governor
of
the
province
was
then
at
newcastle
and
captain
holmes
happening
to
be
in
company
with
him
when
my
letter
came
to
hand
spoke
to
him
of
me
and
show
him
the
letter
the
governor
read
it
and
seem
surpris
when
he
was
told
my
age
he
said
i
appear
a
young
man
of
promising
parts
and
therefore
should
be
encouraged
the
printers
at
philadelphia
were
wretched
ones
and
if
i
would
set
up
there
he
made
no
doubt
i
should
succeed
for
his
part
he
would
procure
me
the
public
business
and
do
me
every
other
service
in
his
power
this
my
afterwards
told
me
in
boston
but
i
knew
as
yet
nothing
of
it
when
one
day
keimer
and
i
being
at
work
together
near
the
window
we
saw
the
governor
and
another
gentleman
which
proved
to
be
colonel
french
of
newcastle
finely
dress
come
directly
across
the
street
to
our
house
and
heard
them
at
the
door
keimer
ran
down
immediately
thinking
it
a
visit
to
him
but
the
governor
inquir
for
me
came
up
and
with
a
condescension
of
politeness
i
had
been
quite
unus
to
made
me
many
compliments
desired
to
be
acquainted
with
me
blam
me
kindly
for
not
having
made
myself
known
to
him
when
i
first
came
to
the
place
and
would
have
me
away
with
him
to
the
tavern
where
he
was
going
with
colonel
french
to
taste
as
he
said
some
excellent
madeira
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
and
keimer
star
like
a
pig
poison
i
went
however
with
the
governor
and
colonel
french
to
a
tavern
at
the
corner
of
and
over
the
madeira
he
propos
my
setting
up
my
business
laid
before
me
the
probabilities
of
success
and
both
he
and
colonel
french
assur
me
i
should
have
their
interest
and
influence
in
procuring
the
public
business
of
both
governments
on
my
doubting
whether
my
father
would
assist
me
in
it
sir
william
said
he
would
give
me
a
letter
to
him
in
which
he
would
state
the
advantages
and
he
did
not
doubt
of
prevailing
with
him
so
it
was
concluded
i
should
return
to
boston
in
the
first
vessel
with
the
governor
letter
recommending
me
to
my
father
in
the
mean
time
the
intention
was
to
be
kept
a
secret
and
i
went
on
working
with
keimer
as
usual
the
governor
sending
for
me
now
and
then
to
dine
with
him
a
very
great
honor
i
thought
it
and
conversing
with
me
in
the
most
affable
familiar
and
friendly
manner
imaginable
about
the
end
of
april
a
little
vessel
offer
for
boston
i
took
leave
of
keimer
as
going
to
see
my
friends
the
governor
gave
me
an
ample
letter
saying
many
flattering
things
of
me
to
my
father
and
strongly
recommending
the
project
of
my
setting
up
at
philadelphia
as
a
thing
that
must
make
my
fortune
we
struck
on
a
shoal
in
going
down
the
bay
and
sprung
a
leak
we
had
a
blustering
time
at
sea
and
were
oblig
to
pump
almost
continually
at
which
i
took
my
turn
we
safe
however
at
boston
in
about
a
fortnight
i
had
been
absent
seven
months
and
my
friends
had
heard
nothing
of
me
for
my
br
holmes
was
not
yet
return
and
had
not
written
about
me
my
unexpected
appearance
surpriz
the
family
all
were
however
very
glad
to
see
me
and
made
me
welcome
except
my
brother
i
went
to
see
him
at
his
i
was
better
dress
than
ever
while
in
his
service
having
a
genteel
new
suit
from
head
to
foot
a
watch
and
my
pockets
lin
with
near
five
pounds
sterling
in
silver
he
receiv
me
not
very
frankly
look
me
all
over
and
turn
to
his
work
again
the
journeymen
were
inquisitive
where
i
had
been
what
sort
of
a
country
it
was
and
how
i
lik
it
i
prais
it
much
the
happy
life
i
led
in
it
expressing
strongly
my
intention
of
returning
to
it
and
one
of
them
asking
what
kind
of
money
we
had
there
i
produc
a
handful
of
silver
and
spread
it
before
them
which
was
a
kind
of
they
had
not
been
us
to
paper
being
the
money
of
boston
then
i
took
an
opportunity
of
letting
them
see
my
watch
and
lastly
my
brother
still
grum
and
sullen
i
gave
them
a
piece
of
eight
to
drink
and
took
my
leave
this
visit
of
mine
offended
him
extreamly
for
when
my
mother
some
time
after
spoke
to
him
of
a
reconciliation
and
of
her
wishes
to
see
us
on
good
terms
together
and
that
we
might
live
for
the
future
as
brothers
he
said
i
had
insulted
him
in
such
a
manner
before
his
people
that
he
could
never
forget
or
forgive
it
in
this
however
he
was
mistaken
my
father
received
the
governor
letter
with
some
apparent
surprise
but
said
little
of
it
to
me
for
some
days
when
capt
holmes
returning
he
showed
it
to
him
ask
him
if
he
knew
keith
and
what
kind
of
man
he
was
adding
his
opinion
that
he
must
be
of
small
discretion
to
think
of
setting
a
boy
up
in
business
who
wanted
yet
three
years
of
being
at
man
estate
holmes
said
what
he
could
in
favor
of
the
project
but
my
father
was
clear
in
the
impropriety
of
it
and
at
last
gave
a
flat
denial
to
it
then
he
wrote
a
civil
letter
to
sir
william
thanking
him
for
the
patronage
he
had
so
kindly
offered
me
but
declining
to
assist
me
as
yet
in
setting
up
i
being
in
his
opinion
too
young
to
be
trusted
with
the
management
of
a
business
so
important
and
for
which
the
preparation
must
be
so
expensive
my
friend
and
companion
collins
who
was
a
clerk
in
the
pleas
with
the
account
i
gave
him
of
my
new
country
determined
to
go
thither
also
and
while
i
waited
for
my
father
determination
he
set
out
before
me
by
land
to
rhode
island
leaving
his
books
which
were
a
pretty
collection
of
mathematicks
and
natural
philosophy
to
come
with
mine
and
me
to
new
york
where
he
propos
to
wait
for
me
my
father
tho
he
did
not
approve
sir
william
proposition
was
yet
pleas
that
i
had
been
able
to
obtain
so
advantageous
a
character
from
a
person
of
such
note
where
i
had
resided
and
that
i
had
been
so
industrious
and
careful
as
to
equip
myself
so
handsomely
in
so
short
a
time
therefore
seeing
no
prospect
of
an
accommodation
between
my
brother
and
me
he
gave
his
consent
to
my
returning
again
to
philadelphia
advis
me
to
behave
respectfully
to
the
people
there
endeavor
to
obtain
the
general
esteem
and
avoid
lampooning
and
libeling
to
which
he
thought
i
had
too
much
inclination
telling
me
that
by
steady
industry
and
a
prudent
parsimony
i
might
save
enough
by
the
time
i
was
to
set
me
up
and
that
if
i
came
near
the
matter
he
would
help
me
out
with
the
rest
this
was
all
i
could
obtain
except
some
small
gifts
as
tokens
of
his
and
my
mother
love
when
i
embark
again
for
new
york
now
with
their
approbation
and
their
blessing
the
sloop
putting
in
at
newport
rhode
island
i
visited
my
brother
john
who
had
been
married
and
settled
there
some
years
he
received
me
very
affectionately
for
he
always
lov
me
a
friend
of
his
one
vernon
having
some
money
due
to
him
in
pensilvania
about
pounds
currency
desired
i
would
receive
it
for
him
and
keep
it
till
i
had
his
directions
what
to
remit
it
in
accordingly
he
gave
me
an
order
this
afterwards
occasion
me
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
at
newport
we
took
in
a
number
of
passengers
for
new
york
among
which
were
two
young
women
companions
and
a
grave
sensible
quaker
woman
with
her
attendants
i
had
shown
an
obliging
readiness
to
do
her
some
little
services
which
impress
her
i
suppose
with
a
degree
of
good
will
toward
me
therefore
when
she
saw
a
daily
growing
familiarity
between
me
and
the
two
young
women
which
they
appear
to
encourage
she
took
me
aside
and
said
young
man
i
am
concern
for
thee
as
thou
has
no
friend
with
thee
and
seems
not
to
know
much
of
the
world
or
of
the
snares
youth
is
expos
to
depend
upon
it
those
are
very
bad
women
i
can
see
it
in
all
their
actions
and
if
thee
art
not
upon
thy
guard
they
will
draw
thee
into
some
danger
they
are
strangers
to
thee
and
i
advise
thee
in
a
friendly
concern
for
thy
welfare
to
have
no
acquaintance
with
them
as
i
seem
at
first
not
to
think
so
ill
of
them
as
she
did
she
mentioned
some
things
she
had
observ
and
heard
that
had
escap
my
notice
but
now
convinc
me
she
was
right
i
thank
her
for
her
kind
advice
and
promis
to
follow
it
when
we
arriv
at
new
york
they
told
me
where
they
liv
and
invited
me
to
come
and
see
them
but
i
avoided
it
and
it
was
well
i
did
for
the
next
day
the
captain
miss
a
silver
spoon
and
some
other
things
that
had
been
taken
out
of
his
cabbin
and
knowing
that
these
were
a
couple
of
strumpets
he
got
a
warrant
to
search
their
lodgings
found
the
stolen
goods
and
had
the
thieves
punish
so
tho
we
had
escap
a
sunken
rock
which
we
scrap
upon
in
the
passage
i
thought
this
escape
of
rather
more
importance
to
me
at
new
york
i
found
my
friend
collins
who
had
arriv
there
some
time
before
me
we
had
been
intimate
from
children
and
had
read
the
same
books
together
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
more
time
for
reading
and
studying
and
a
wonderful
genius
for
mathematical
learning
in
which
he
far
outstript
me
while
i
liv
in
boston
most
of
my
hours
of
leisure
for
conversation
were
spent
with
him
and
he
continu
a
sober
as
well
as
an
industrious
lad
was
much
respected
for
his
learning
by
several
of
the
clergy
and
other
gentlemen
and
seemed
to
promise
making
a
good
figure
in
life
but
during
my
absence
he
had
acquir
a
habit
of
sotting
with
brandy
and
i
found
by
his
own
account
and
what
i
heard
from
others
that
he
had
been
drunk
every
day
since
his
arrival
at
new
york
and
behav
very
oddly
he
had
gam
too
and
lost
his
money
so
that
i
was
oblig
to
discharge
his
lodgings
and
defray
his
expenses
to
and
at
philadelphia
which
prov
extremely
inconvenient
to
me
the
then
governor
of
new
york
burnet
son
of
bishop
burnet
hearing
from
the
captain
that
a
young
man
one
of
his
passengers
had
a
great
many
books
desir
he
would
bring
me
to
see
him
i
waited
upon
him
accordingly
and
should
have
taken
collins
with
me
but
that
he
was
not
sober
the
treated
me
with
great
civility
show
me
his
library
which
was
a
very
large
one
and
we
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
about
books
and
authors
this
was
the
second
governor
who
had
done
me
the
honor
to
take
notice
of
me
which
to
a
poor
boy
like
me
was
very
pleasing
we
proceeded
to
philadelphia
i
received
on
the
way
vernon
money
without
which
we
could
hardly
have
finish
our
journey
collins
wished
to
be
employ
in
some
but
whether
they
discover
his
dramming
by
his
breath
or
by
his
behaviour
tho
he
had
some
recommendations
he
met
with
no
success
in
any
application
and
continu
lodging
and
boarding
at
the
same
house
with
me
and
at
my
expense
knowing
i
had
that
money
of
vernon
he
was
continually
borrowing
of
me
still
promising
repayment
as
soon
as
he
should
be
in
business
at
length
he
had
got
so
much
of
it
that
i
was
distress
to
think
what
i
should
do
in
case
of
being
call
on
to
remit
it
his
drinking
continu
about
which
we
sometimes
quarrell
for
when
a
little
intoxicated
he
was
very
fractious
once
in
a
boat
on
the
delaware
with
some
other
young
men
he
refused
to
row
in
his
turn
i
will
be
row
home
says
he
we
will
not
row
you
says
i
you
must
or
stay
all
night
on
the
water
says
he
just
as
you
please
the
others
said
let
us
row
what
signifies
it
but
my
mind
being
soured
with
his
other
conduct
i
continu
to
refuse
so
he
swore
he
would
make
me
row
or
throw
me
overboard
and
coming
along
stepping
on
the
thwarts
toward
me
when
he
came
up
and
struck
at
me
i
clapped
my
hand
under
his
crutch
and
rising
pitched
him
into
the
river
i
knew
he
was
a
good
swimmer
and
so
was
under
little
concern
about
him
but
before
he
could
get
round
to
lay
hold
of
the
boat
we
had
with
a
few
strokes
pull
her
out
of
his
reach
and
ever
when
he
drew
near
the
boat
we
ask
if
he
would
row
striking
a
few
strokes
to
slide
her
away
from
him
he
was
ready
to
die
with
vexation
and
obstinately
would
not
promise
to
row
however
seeing
him
at
last
beginning
to
tire
we
lifted
him
in
and
brought
him
home
dripping
wet
in
the
evening
we
hardly
exchang
a
civil
word
afterwards
and
a
west
india
captain
who
had
a
commission
to
procure
a
tutor
for
the
sons
of
a
gentleman
at
barbadoes
happening
to
meet
with
him
agreed
to
carry
him
thither
he
left
me
then
promising
to
remit
me
the
first
money
he
should
receive
in
order
to
discharge
the
debt
but
i
never
heard
of
him
after
the
breaking
into
this
money
of
vernon
was
one
of
the
first
great
errata
of
my
life
and
this
affair
show
that
my
father
was
not
much
out
in
his
judgment
when
he
suppos
me
too
young
to
manage
business
of
importance
but
sir
william
on
reading
his
letter
said
he
was
too
prudent
there
was
great
difference
in
persons
and
discretion
did
not
always
accompany
years
nor
was
youth
always
without
it
and
since
he
will
not
set
you
up
says
he
i
will
do
it
myself
give
me
an
inventory
of
the
things
necessary
to
be
had
from
england
and
i
will
send
for
them
you
shall
repay
me
when
you
are
able
i
am
resolv
to
have
a
good
printer
here
and
i
am
sure
you
must
succeed
this
was
spoken
with
such
an
appearance
of
cordiality
that
i
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
his
meaning
what
he
said
i
had
hitherto
kept
the
proposition
of
my
setting
up
a
secret
in
philadelphia
and
i
still
kept
it
had
it
been
known
that
i
depended
on
the
governor
probably
some
friend
that
knew
him
better
would
have
advis
me
not
to
rely
on
him
as
i
afterwards
heard
it
as
his
known
character
to
be
liberal
of
promises
which
he
never
meant
to
keep
yet
unsolicited
as
he
was
by
me
how
could
i
think
his
generous
offers
insincere
i
believ
him
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
world
i
presented
him
an
inventory
of
a
little
amounting
by
my
computation
to
about
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
he
lik
it
but
me
if
my
being
on
the
spot
in
england
to
chuse
the
types
and
see
that
every
thing
was
good
of
the
kind
might
not
be
of
some
advantage
then
says
he
when
there
you
may
make
acquaintances
and
establish
correspondences
in
the
bookselling
and
stationery
way
i
agreed
that
this
might
be
advantageous
then
says
he
get
yourself
ready
to
go
with
annis
which
was
the
annual
ship
and
the
only
one
at
that
time
usually
passing
between
london
and
philadelphia
but
it
would
be
some
months
before
annis
sail
so
i
continu
working
with
keimer
fretting
about
the
money
collins
had
got
from
me
and
in
daily
apprehensions
of
being
call
upon
by
vernon
which
however
did
not
happen
for
some
years
after
i
believe
i
have
omitted
mentioning
that
in
my
first
voyage
from
boston
being
becalm
off
block
island
our
people
set
about
catching
cod
and
hauled
up
a
great
many
hitherto
i
had
stuck
to
my
resolution
of
not
eating
animal
food
and
on
this
occasion
consider
with
my
master
tryon
the
taking
every
fish
as
a
kind
of
unprovoked
murder
since
none
of
them
had
or
ever
could
do
us
any
injury
that
might
justify
the
slaughter
all
this
seemed
very
reasonable
but
i
had
formerly
been
a
great
lover
of
fish
and
when
this
came
hot
out
of
the
it
smelt
admirably
well
i
balanc
some
time
between
principle
and
inclination
till
i
recollected
that
when
the
fish
were
opened
i
saw
smaller
fish
taken
out
of
their
stomachs
then
thought
i
if
you
eat
one
another
i
do
see
why
we
may
eat
you
so
i
upon
cod
very
heartily
and
continued
to
eat
with
other
people
returning
only
now
and
then
occasionally
to
a
vegetable
diet
so
convenient
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
reasonable
creature
since
it
enables
one
to
find
or
make
a
reason
for
everything
one
has
a
mind
to
do
keimer
and
i
liv
on
a
pretty
good
familiar
footing
and
agreed
tolerably
well
for
he
suspected
nothing
of
my
setting
up
he
retained
a
great
deal
of
his
old
enthusiasms
and
lov
argumentation
we
therefore
had
many
disputations
i
used
to
work
him
so
with
my
socratic
method
and
had
trepann
him
so
often
by
questions
apparently
so
distant
from
any
point
we
had
in
hand
and
yet
by
degrees
lead
to
the
point
and
brought
him
into
difficulties
and
contradictions
that
at
last
he
grew
ridiculously
cautious
and
would
hardly
answer
me
the
most
common
question
without
asking
first
what
do
you
intend
to
infer
from
that
however
it
gave
him
so
high
an
opinion
of
my
abilities
in
the
confuting
way
that
he
seriously
proposed
my
being
his
colleague
in
a
project
he
had
of
setting
up
a
new
sect
he
was
to
preach
the
doctrines
and
i
was
to
confound
all
opponents
when
he
came
to
explain
with
me
upon
the
doctrines
i
found
several
conundrums
which
i
objected
to
unless
i
might
have
my
way
a
little
too
and
introduce
some
of
mine
keimer
wore
his
beard
at
full
length
because
somewhere
in
the
mosaic
law
it
is
said
thou
shalt
not
mar
the
corners
of
thy
beard
he
likewise
kept
the
seventh
day
sabbath
and
these
two
points
were
essentials
with
him
i
dislik
both
but
agreed
to
admit
them
upon
condition
of
his
adopting
the
doctrine
of
using
no
animal
food
i
doubt
said
he
my
constitution
will
not
bear
that
i
assur
him
it
would
and
that
he
would
be
the
better
for
it
he
was
usually
a
great
glutton
and
i
promised
myself
some
diversion
in
half
starving
him
he
agreed
to
try
the
practice
if
i
would
keep
him
company
i
did
so
and
we
held
it
for
three
months
we
had
our
victuals
dress
and
brought
to
us
regularly
by
a
woman
in
the
neighborhood
who
had
from
me
a
list
of
forty
dishes
to
be
prepar
for
us
at
different
times
in
all
which
there
was
neither
fish
flesh
nor
fowl
and
the
whim
suited
me
the
better
at
this
time
from
the
cheapness
of
it
not
costing
us
above
eighteenpence
sterling
each
per
week
i
have
since
kept
several
lents
most
strictly
leaving
the
common
diet
for
that
and
that
for
the
common
abruptly
without
the
least
inconvenience
so
that
i
think
there
is
little
in
the
advice
of
making
those
changes
by
easy
gradations
i
went
on
pleasantly
but
poor
keimer
suffered
grievously
tired
of
the
project
long
for
the
of
egypt
and
order
a
roast
pig
he
invited
me
and
two
women
friends
to
dine
with
him
but
it
being
brought
too
soon
upon
table
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
and
ate
the
whole
before
we
came
i
had
made
some
courtship
during
this
time
to
miss
read
i
had
a
great
respect
and
affection
for
her
and
had
some
reason
to
believe
she
had
the
same
for
me
but
as
i
was
about
to
take
a
long
voyage
and
we
were
both
very
young
only
a
little
above
eighteen
it
was
thought
most
prudent
by
her
mother
to
prevent
our
going
too
far
at
present
as
a
marriage
if
it
was
to
take
place
would
be
more
convenient
after
my
return
when
i
should
be
as
i
expected
set
up
in
my
business
perhaps
too
she
thought
my
expectations
not
so
well
founded
as
i
imagined
them
to
be
my
chief
acquaintances
at
this
time
were
charles
osborne
joseph
watson
and
james
ralph
all
lovers
of
reading
the
two
first
were
clerks
to
an
eminent
scrivener
or
conveyancer
in
the
town
charles
brogden
the
other
was
clerk
to
a
merchant
watson
was
a
pious
sensible
young
man
of
great
integrity
the
others
rather
more
lax
in
their
principles
of
religion
particularly
ralph
who
as
well
as
collins
had
been
unsettled
by
me
for
which
they
both
made
me
suffer
osborne
was
sensible
candid
frank
sincere
and
affectionate
to
his
friends
but
in
literary
matters
too
fond
of
criticising
ralph
was
ingenious
genteel
in
his
manners
and
extremely
eloquent
i
think
i
never
knew
a
prettier
talker
both
of
them
great
admirers
of
poetry
and
began
to
try
their
hands
in
little
pieces
many
pleasant
walks
we
four
had
together
on
sundays
into
the
woods
near
schuylkill
where
we
read
to
one
another
and
conferr
on
what
we
read
ralph
was
inclin
to
pursue
the
study
of
poetry
not
doubting
but
he
might
become
eminent
in
it
and
make
his
fortune
by
it
alleging
that
the
best
poets
must
when
they
first
began
to
write
make
as
many
faults
as
he
did
osborne
dissuaded
him
assur
him
he
had
no
genius
for
poetry
and
advis
him
to
think
of
nothing
beyond
the
business
he
was
bred
to
that
in
the
mercantile
way
tho
he
had
no
stock
he
might
by
his
diligence
and
punctuality
recommend
himself
to
employment
as
a
factor
and
in
time
acquire
wherewith
to
trade
on
his
own
account
i
approv
the
amusing
one
self
with
poetry
now
and
then
so
far
as
to
improve
one
language
but
no
farther
on
this
it
was
propos
that
we
should
each
of
us
at
our
next
meeting
produce
a
piece
of
our
own
composing
in
order
to
improve
by
our
mutual
observations
criticisms
and
corrections
as
language
and
expression
were
what
we
had
in
view
we
excluded
all
considerations
of
invention
by
agreeing
that
the
task
should
be
a
version
of
the
eighteenth
psalm
which
describes
the
descent
of
a
deity
when
the
time
of
our
meeting
drew
nigh
ralph
called
on
me
first
and
let
me
know
his
piece
was
ready
i
told
him
i
had
been
busy
and
having
little
inclination
had
done
nothing
he
then
show
me
his
piece
for
my
opinion
and
i
much
approv
it
as
it
appear
to
me
to
have
great
merit
now
says
he
osborne
never
will
allow
the
least
merit
in
any
thing
of
mine
but
makes
criticisms
out
of
mere
envy
he
is
not
so
jealous
of
you
i
wish
therefore
you
would
take
this
piece
and
produce
it
as
yours
i
will
pretend
not
to
have
had
time
and
so
produce
nothing
we
shall
then
see
what
he
will
say
to
it
it
was
agreed
and
i
immediately
transcrib
it
that
it
might
appear
in
my
own
hand
we
met
watson
performance
was
read
there
were
some
beauties
in
it
but
many
defects
osborne
was
read
it
was
much
better
ralph
did
it
justice
remarked
some
faults
but
applauded
the
beauties
he
himself
had
nothing
to
produce
i
was
backward
seemed
desirous
of
being
excused
had
not
had
sufficient
time
to
correct
etc
but
no
excuse
could
be
admitted
produce
i
must
it
was
read
and
repeated
watson
and
osborne
gave
up
the
contest
and
join
in
applauding
it
ralph
only
made
some
criticisms
and
propos
some
amendments
but
i
defended
my
text
osborne
was
against
ralph
and
told
him
he
was
no
better
a
critic
than
poet
so
he
dropt
the
argument
as
they
two
went
home
together
osborne
expressed
himself
still
more
strongly
in
favor
of
what
he
thought
my
production
having
restrain
himself
before
as
he
said
lest
i
should
think
it
flattery
but
who
would
have
imagin
said
he
that
franklin
had
been
capable
of
such
a
performance
such
painting
such
force
such
fire
he
has
even
improv
the
original
in
his
common
conversation
he
seems
to
have
no
choice
of
words
he
hesitates
and
blunders
and
yet
good
god
how
he
writes
when
we
next
met
ralph
discovered
the
trick
we
had
plaid
him
and
osborne
was
a
little
laught
at
this
transaction
fixed
ralph
in
his
resolution
of
becoming
a
poet
i
did
all
i
could
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
continued
scribbling
verses
till
pope
cured
him
he
became
however
a
pretty
good
prose
writer
more
of
him
hereafter
but
as
i
may
not
have
occasion
again
to
mention
the
other
two
i
shall
just
remark
here
that
watson
died
in
my
arms
a
few
years
after
much
lamented
being
the
best
of
our
set
osborne
went
to
the
west
indies
where
he
became
an
eminent
lawyer
and
made
money
but
died
young
he
and
i
had
made
a
serious
agreement
that
the
one
who
happen
first
to
die
should
if
possible
make
a
friendly
visit
to
the
other
and
acquaint
him
how
he
found
things
in
that
separate
state
but
he
never
fulfill
his
promise
the
governor
seeming
to
like
my
company
had
me
frequently
to
his
house
and
his
setting
me
up
was
always
mention
as
a
fixed
thing
i
was
to
take
with
me
letters
recommendatory
to
a
number
of
his
friends
besides
the
letter
of
credit
to
furnish
me
with
the
necessary
money
for
purchasing
the
press
and
types
paper
etc
for
these
letters
i
was
appointed
to
call
at
different
times
when
they
were
to
be
ready
but
a
future
time
was
still
named
thus
he
went
on
till
the
ship
whose
departure
too
had
been
several
times
postponed
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
then
when
i
call
to
take
my
leave
and
receive
the
letters
his
secretary
bard
came
out
to
me
and
said
the
governor
was
extremely
busy
in
writing
but
would
be
down
at
newcastle
before
the
ship
and
there
the
letters
would
be
delivered
to
me
ralph
though
married
and
having
one
child
had
determined
to
accompany
me
in
this
voyage
it
was
thought
he
intended
to
establish
a
correspondence
and
obtain
goods
to
sell
on
commission
but
i
found
afterwards
that
thro
some
discontent
with
his
wife
relations
he
purposed
to
leave
her
on
their
hands
and
never
return
again
having
taken
leave
of
my
friends
and
interchang
some
promises
with
miss
read
i
left
philadelphia
in
the
ship
which
anchor
at
newcastle
the
governor
was
there
but
when
i
went
to
his
lodging
the
secretary
came
to
me
from
him
with
the
civillest
message
in
the
world
that
he
could
not
then
see
me
being
engaged
in
business
of
the
utmost
importance
but
should
send
the
letters
to
me
on
board
wish
me
heartily
a
good
voyage
and
a
speedy
return
etc
i
returned
on
board
a
little
puzzled
but
still
not
doubting
andrew
hamilton
a
famous
lawyer
of
philadelphia
had
taken
passage
in
the
same
ship
for
himself
and
son
and
with
denham
a
quaker
merchant
and
onion
and
russel
masters
of
an
iron
work
in
maryland
had
engag
the
great
cabin
so
that
ralph
and
i
were
forced
to
take
up
with
a
berth
in
the
steerage
and
none
on
board
knowing
us
were
considered
as
ordinary
persons
but
hamilton
and
his
son
it
was
james
since
governor
return
from
newcastle
to
philadelphia
the
father
being
recall
by
a
great
fee
to
plead
for
a
seized
ship
and
just
before
we
sail
colonel
french
coming
on
board
and
showing
me
great
respect
i
was
more
taken
notice
of
and
with
my
friend
ralph
invited
by
the
other
gentlemen
to
come
into
the
cabin
there
being
now
room
accordingly
we
remov
thither
understanding
that
colonel
french
had
brought
on
board
the
despatches
i
ask
the
captain
for
those
letters
that
were
to
be
under
my
care
he
said
all
were
put
into
the
bag
together
and
he
could
not
then
come
at
them
but
before
we
landed
in
england
i
should
have
an
opportunity
of
picking
them
out
so
i
was
satisfied
for
the
present
and
we
proceeded
on
our
voyage
we
had
a
sociable
company
in
the
cabin
and
lived
uncommonly
well
having
the
addition
of
all
hamilton
stores
who
had
laid
in
plentifully
in
this
passage
denham
contracted
a
friendship
for
me
that
continued
during
his
life
the
voyage
was
otherwise
not
a
pleasant
one
as
we
had
a
great
deal
of
bad
weather
when
we
came
into
the
channel
the
captain
kept
his
word
with
me
and
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
bag
for
the
governor
letters
i
found
none
upon
which
my
name
was
put
as
under
my
care
i
picked
out
six
or
seven
that
by
the
handwriting
i
thought
might
be
the
promised
letters
especially
as
one
of
them
was
directed
to
basket
the
printer
and
another
to
some
stationer
we
arriv
in
london
the
of
december
i
waited
upon
the
stationer
who
came
first
in
my
way
delivering
the
letter
as
from
governor
keith
i
do
know
such
a
person
says
he
but
opening
the
letter
o
this
is
from
riddlesden
i
have
lately
found
him
to
be
a
compleat
rascal
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
nor
receive
any
letters
from
him
so
putting
the
letter
into
my
hand
he
turn
on
his
heel
and
left
me
to
serve
some
customer
i
was
surprized
to
find
these
were
not
the
governor
letters
and
after
recollecting
and
comparing
circumstances
i
began
to
doubt
his
sincerity
i
found
my
friend
denham
and
opened
the
whole
affair
to
him
he
let
me
into
keith
character
told
me
there
was
not
the
least
probability
that
he
had
written
any
letters
for
me
that
no
one
who
knew
him
had
the
smallest
dependence
on
him
and
he
laught
at
the
notion
of
the
governor
giving
me
a
letter
of
credit
having
as
he
said
no
credit
to
give
on
my
expressing
some
concern
about
what
i
should
do
he
advised
me
to
endeavor
getting
some
employment
in
the
way
of
my
business
among
the
printers
here
said
he
you
will
improve
yourself
and
when
you
return
to
america
you
will
set
up
to
greater
advantage
we
both
of
us
happen
to
know
as
well
as
the
stationer
that
riddlesden
the
attorney
was
a
very
knave
he
had
half
ruin
miss
read
father
by
persuading
him
to
be
bound
for
him
by
this
letter
it
appear
there
was
a
secret
scheme
on
foot
to
the
prejudice
of
hamilton
suppos
to
be
then
coming
over
with
us
and
that
keith
was
concerned
in
it
with
riddlesden
denham
who
was
a
friend
of
hamilton
thought
he
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
it
so
when
he
arriv
in
england
which
was
soon
after
partly
from
resentment
and
to
keith
and
riddlesden
and
partly
from
to
him
i
waited
on
him
and
gave
him
the
letter
he
thank
me
cordially
the
information
being
of
importance
to
him
and
from
that
time
he
became
my
friend
greatly
to
my
advantage
afterwards
on
many
occasions
but
what
shall
we
think
of
a
governor
playing
such
pitiful
tricks
and
imposing
so
grossly
on
a
poor
ignorant
boy
it
was
a
habit
he
had
acquired
he
wish
to
please
everybody
and
having
little
to
give
he
gave
expectations
he
was
otherwise
an
ingenious
sensible
man
a
pretty
good
writer
and
a
good
governor
for
the
people
tho
not
for
his
constituents
the
proprietaries
whose
instructions
he
sometimes
disregarded
several
of
our
best
laws
were
of
his
planning
and
passed
during
his
administration
ralph
and
i
were
inseparable
companions
we
took
lodgings
together
in
little
britain
at
three
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
as
much
as
we
could
then
afford
he
found
some
relations
but
they
were
poor
and
unable
to
assist
him
he
now
let
me
know
his
intentions
of
remaining
in
london
and
that
he
never
meant
to
return
to
philadelphia
he
had
brought
no
money
with
him
the
whole
he
could
muster
having
been
expended
in
paying
his
passage
i
had
fifteen
pistoles
so
he
borrowed
occasionally
of
me
to
subsist
while
he
was
looking
out
for
business
he
first
endeavored
to
get
into
the
playhouse
believing
himself
for
an
actor
but
wilkes
to
whom
he
apply
advis
him
candidly
not
to
think
of
that
employment
as
it
was
impossible
he
should
succeed
in
it
then
he
propos
to
roberts
a
publisher
in
paternoster
row
to
write
for
him
a
weekly
paper
like
the
spectator
on
certain
conditions
which
roberts
did
not
approve
then
he
endeavored
to
get
employment
as
a
hackney
writer
to
copy
for
the
stationers
and
lawyers
about
the
temple
but
could
find
no
vacancy
i
immediately
got
into
work
at
palmer
then
a
famous
in
bartholomew
close
and
here
i
continu
near
a
year
i
was
pretty
diligent
but
spent
with
ralph
a
good
deal
of
my
earnings
in
going
to
plays
and
other
places
of
amusement
we
had
together
consumed
all
my
pistoles
and
now
just
rubbed
on
from
hand
to
mouth
he
seem
quite
to
forget
his
wife
and
child
and
i
by
degrees
my
engagements
with
miss
read
to
whom
i
never
wrote
more
than
one
letter
and
that
was
to
let
her
know
i
was
not
likely
soon
to
return
this
was
another
of
the
great
errata
of
my
life
which
i
should
wish
to
correct
if
i
were
to
live
it
over
again
in
fact
by
our
expenses
i
was
constantly
kept
unable
to
pay
my
passage
at
palmer
i
was
employed
in
composing
for
the
second
edition
of
wollaston
religion
of
nature
some
of
his
reasonings
not
appearing
to
me
well
founded
i
wrote
a
little
metaphysical
piece
in
which
i
made
remarks
on
them
it
was
entitled
a
dissertation
on
liberty
and
necessity
pleasure
and
pain
i
inscribed
it
to
my
friend
ralph
i
printed
a
small
number
it
occasion
my
being
more
consider
by
palmer
as
a
young
man
of
some
ingenuity
tho
he
seriously
expostulated
with
me
upon
the
principles
of
my
pamphlet
which
to
him
abominable
my
printing
this
pamphlet
was
another
erratum
while
i
lodg
in
little
britain
i
made
an
acquaintance
with
one
wilcox
a
bookseller
whose
shop
was
at
the
next
door
he
had
an
immense
collection
of
books
circulating
libraries
were
not
then
in
use
but
we
agreed
that
on
certain
reasonable
terms
which
i
have
now
forgotten
i
might
take
read
and
return
any
of
his
books
this
i
esteem
a
great
advantage
and
i
made
as
much
use
of
it
as
i
could
my
pamphlet
by
some
means
falling
into
the
hands
of
one
lyons
a
surgeon
author
of
a
book
entitled
the
infallibility
of
human
judgment
it
occasioned
an
acquaintance
between
us
he
took
great
notice
of
me
called
on
me
often
to
converse
on
those
subjects
carried
me
to
the
horns
a
pale
alehouse
in
lane
cheapside
and
introduced
me
to
mandeville
author
of
the
fable
of
the
bees
who
had
a
club
there
of
which
he
was
the
soul
being
a
most
facetious
entertaining
companion
lyons
too
introduced
me
to
pemberton
at
batson
who
promis
to
give
me
an
opportunity
some
time
or
other
of
seeing
sir
isaac
newton
of
which
i
was
extreamely
desirous
but
this
never
happened
i
had
brought
over
a
few
curiosities
among
which
the
principal
was
a
purse
made
of
the
asbestos
which
purifies
by
fire
sir
hans
sloane
heard
of
it
came
to
see
me
and
invited
me
to
his
house
in
bloomsbury
square
where
he
show
me
all
his
curiosities
and
persuaded
me
to
let
him
add
that
to
the
number
for
which
he
paid
me
handsomely
in
our
house
there
lodg
a
young
woman
a
milliner
who
i
think
had
a
shop
in
the
cloisters
she
had
been
genteelly
bred
was
sensible
and
lively
and
of
most
pleasing
conversation
ralph
read
plays
to
her
in
the
evenings
they
grew
intimate
she
took
another
lodging
and
he
followed
her
they
liv
together
some
time
but
he
being
still
out
of
business
and
her
income
not
sufficient
to
maintain
them
with
her
child
he
took
a
resolution
of
going
from
london
to
try
for
a
country
school
which
he
thought
himself
well
qualified
to
undertake
as
he
wrote
an
excellent
hand
and
was
a
master
of
arithmetic
and
accounts
this
however
he
deemed
a
business
below
him
and
confident
of
future
better
fortune
when
he
should
be
unwilling
to
have
it
known
that
he
once
was
so
meanly
employed
he
changed
his
name
and
did
me
the
honor
to
assume
mine
for
i
soon
after
had
a
letter
from
him
acquainting
me
that
he
was
settled
in
a
small
village
in
berkshire
i
think
it
was
where
he
taught
reading
and
writing
to
ten
or
a
dozen
boys
at
sixpence
each
per
week
recommending
t
to
my
care
and
desiring
me
to
write
to
him
directing
for
franklin
schoolmaster
at
such
a
place
he
continued
to
write
frequently
sending
me
large
specimens
of
an
epic
poem
which
he
was
then
composing
and
desiring
my
remarks
and
corrections
these
i
gave
him
from
time
to
time
but
endeavor
rather
to
discourage
his
proceeding
one
of
young
satires
was
then
just
published
i
copy
and
sent
him
a
great
part
of
it
which
set
in
a
strong
light
the
folly
of
pursuing
the
muses
with
any
hope
of
advancement
by
them
all
was
in
vain
sheets
of
the
poem
continued
to
come
by
every
post
in
the
mean
time
t
having
on
his
account
lost
her
friends
and
business
was
often
in
distresses
and
to
send
for
me
and
borrow
what
i
could
spare
to
help
her
out
of
them
i
grew
fond
of
her
company
and
being
at
that
time
under
no
religious
restraint
and
presuming
upon
my
importance
to
her
i
attempted
familiarities
another
erratum
which
she
repuls
with
a
proper
resentment
and
acquainted
him
with
my
behaviour
this
made
a
breach
between
us
and
when
he
returned
again
to
london
he
let
me
know
he
thought
i
had
cancell
all
the
obligations
he
had
been
under
to
me
so
i
found
i
was
never
to
expect
his
repaying
me
what
i
lent
to
him
or
advanc
for
him
this
however
was
not
then
of
much
consequence
as
he
was
totally
unable
and
in
the
loss
of
his
friendship
i
found
myself
relieved
from
a
burthen
i
now
began
to
think
of
getting
a
little
money
beforehand
and
expecting
better
work
i
left
palmer
to
work
at
watts
near
lincoln
inn
fields
a
still
greater
here
i
continued
all
the
rest
of
my
stay
in
london
at
my
first
admission
into
this
i
took
to
working
at
press
imagining
i
felt
a
want
of
the
bodily
exercise
i
had
been
us
to
in
america
where
presswork
is
mix
with
composing
i
drank
only
water
the
other
workmen
near
fifty
in
number
were
great
guzzlers
of
beer
on
occasion
i
carried
up
and
down
stairs
a
large
form
of
types
in
each
hand
when
others
carried
but
one
in
both
hands
they
wondered
to
see
from
this
and
several
instances
that
the
as
they
called
me
was
stronger
than
themselves
who
drank
strong
beer
we
had
an
alehouse
boy
who
attended
always
in
the
house
to
supply
the
workmen
my
companion
at
the
press
drank
every
day
a
pint
before
breakfast
a
pint
at
breakfast
with
his
bread
and
cheese
a
pint
between
breakfast
and
dinner
a
pint
at
dinner
a
pint
in
the
afternoon
about
six
and
another
when
he
had
done
his
day
work
i
thought
it
a
detestable
custom
but
it
was
necessary
he
suppos
to
drink
strong
beer
that
he
might
be
strong
to
labor
i
endeavored
to
convince
him
that
the
bodily
strength
afforded
by
beer
could
only
be
in
proportion
to
the
grain
or
flour
of
the
barley
dissolved
in
the
water
of
which
it
was
made
that
there
was
more
flour
in
a
pennyworth
of
bread
and
therefore
if
he
would
eat
that
with
a
pint
of
water
it
would
give
him
more
strength
than
a
quart
of
beer
he
drank
on
however
and
had
four
or
five
shillings
to
pay
out
of
his
wages
every
saturday
night
for
that
muddling
liquor
an
expense
i
was
free
from
and
thus
these
poor
devils
keep
themselves
always
under
watts
after
some
weeks
desiring
to
have
me
in
the
i
left
the
pressmen
a
new
bien
venu
or
sum
for
drink
being
five
shillings
was
demanded
of
me
by
the
compositors
i
thought
it
an
imposition
as
i
had
paid
below
the
master
thought
so
too
and
forbad
my
paying
it
i
stood
out
two
or
three
weeks
was
accordingly
considered
as
an
excommunicate
and
had
so
many
little
pieces
of
private
mischief
done
me
by
mixing
my
sorts
transposing
my
pages
breaking
my
matter
if
i
were
ever
so
little
out
of
the
room
and
all
ascribed
to
the
chappel
ghost
which
they
said
ever
haunted
those
not
regularly
admitted
that
notwithstanding
the
master
protection
i
found
myself
oblig
to
comply
and
pay
the
money
convinc
of
the
folly
of
being
on
ill
terms
with
those
one
is
to
live
with
continually
i
was
now
on
a
fair
footing
with
them
and
soon
acquir
considerable
influence
i
propos
some
reasonable
alterations
in
their
chappel
laws
and
carried
them
against
all
opposition
from
my
example
a
great
part
of
them
left
their
muddling
breakfast
of
beer
and
bread
and
cheese
finding
they
could
with
me
be
suppli
from
a
neighboring
house
with
a
large
porringer
of
hot
sprinkled
with
pepper
crumbl
with
bread
and
a
bit
of
butter
in
it
for
the
price
of
a
pint
of
beer
three
this
was
a
more
comfortable
as
well
as
cheaper
breakfast
and
kept
their
heads
clearer
those
who
continued
sotting
with
beer
all
day
were
often
by
not
paying
out
of
credit
at
the
alehouse
and
us
to
make
interest
with
me
to
get
beer
their
light
as
they
phrased
it
being
out
i
watch
the
on
saturday
night
and
collected
what
i
stood
engag
for
them
having
to
pay
sometimes
near
thirty
shillings
a
week
on
their
account
this
and
my
being
esteem
a
pretty
good
riggite
that
is
a
jocular
verbal
satirist
supported
my
consequence
in
the
society
my
constant
attendance
i
never
making
a
monday
recommended
me
to
the
master
and
my
uncommon
quickness
at
composing
occasioned
my
being
put
upon
all
work
of
dispatch
which
was
generally
better
paid
so
i
went
on
now
very
agreeably
a
is
always
called
a
chapel
by
the
workmen
the
origin
of
which
appears
to
have
been
that
printing
was
first
carried
on
in
england
in
an
ancient
chapel
converted
into
a
and
the
title
has
been
preserved
by
tradition
the
bien
venu
among
the
printers
answers
to
the
terms
entrance
and
footing
among
mechanics
thus
a
journeyman
on
entering
a
was
accustomed
to
pay
one
or
more
gallons
of
beer
for
the
good
of
the
chapel
this
custom
was
falling
into
disuse
thirty
years
ago
it
is
very
properly
rejected
entirely
in
the
united
w
my
lodging
in
little
britain
being
too
remote
i
found
another
in
opposite
to
the
romish
chapel
it
was
two
pair
of
stairs
backwards
at
an
italian
warehouse
a
widow
lady
kept
the
house
she
had
a
daughter
and
a
maid
servant
and
a
journeyman
who
attended
the
warehouse
but
lodg
abroad
after
sending
to
inquire
my
character
at
the
house
where
i
last
lodg
she
agreed
to
take
me
in
at
the
same
rate
per
week
cheaper
as
she
said
from
the
protection
she
expected
in
having
a
man
lodge
in
the
house
she
was
a
widow
an
elderly
woman
had
been
bred
a
protestant
being
a
clergyman
daughter
but
was
converted
to
the
catholic
religion
by
her
husband
whose
memory
she
much
revered
had
lived
much
among
people
of
distinction
and
knew
a
thousand
anecdotes
of
them
as
far
back
as
the
times
of
charles
the
second
she
was
lame
in
her
knees
with
the
gout
and
therefore
seldom
stirred
out
of
her
room
so
sometimes
wanted
company
and
hers
was
so
highly
amusing
to
me
that
i
was
sure
to
spend
an
evening
with
her
whenever
she
desired
it
our
supper
was
only
half
an
anchovy
each
on
a
very
little
strip
of
bread
and
butter
and
half
a
pint
of
ale
between
us
but
the
entertainment
was
in
her
conversation
my
always
keeping
good
hours
and
giving
little
trouble
in
the
family
made
her
unwilling
to
part
with
me
so
that
when
i
talk
of
a
lodging
i
had
heard
of
nearer
my
business
for
two
shillings
a
week
which
intent
as
i
now
was
on
saving
money
made
some
difference
she
bid
me
not
think
of
it
for
she
would
abate
me
two
shillings
a
week
for
the
future
so
i
remained
with
her
at
one
shilling
and
sixpence
as
long
as
i
staid
in
london
in
a
garret
of
her
house
there
lived
a
maiden
lady
of
seventy
in
the
most
retired
manner
of
whom
my
landlady
gave
me
this
account
that
she
was
a
roman
catholic
had
been
sent
abroad
when
young
and
lodg
in
a
nunnery
with
an
intent
of
becoming
a
nun
but
the
country
not
agreeing
with
her
she
returned
to
england
where
there
being
no
nunnery
she
had
vow
to
lead
the
life
of
a
nun
as
near
as
might
be
done
in
those
circumstances
accordingly
she
had
given
all
her
estate
to
charitable
uses
reserving
only
twelve
pounds
a
year
to
live
on
and
out
of
this
sum
she
still
gave
a
great
deal
in
charity
living
herself
on
only
and
using
no
fire
but
to
boil
it
she
had
lived
many
years
in
that
garret
being
permitted
to
remain
there
gratis
by
successive
catholic
tenants
of
the
house
below
as
they
deemed
it
a
blessing
to
have
her
there
a
priest
visited
her
to
confess
her
every
day
i
have
ask
her
says
my
landlady
how
she
as
she
liv
could
possibly
find
so
much
employment
for
a
confessor
oh
said
she
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
vain
thoughts
i
was
permitted
once
to
visit
her
she
was
chearful
and
polite
and
convers
pleasantly
the
room
was
clean
but
had
no
other
furniture
than
a
matras
a
table
with
a
crucifix
and
book
a
stool
which
she
gave
me
to
sit
on
and
a
picture
over
the
chimney
of
saint
veronica
displaying
her
handkerchief
with
the
miraculous
figure
of
christ
bleeding
face
on
it
which
she
explained
to
me
with
great
seriousness
she
look
pale
but
was
never
sick
and
i
give
it
as
another
instance
on
how
small
an
income
life
and
health
may
be
supported
at
watts
i
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
an
ingenious
young
man
one
wygate
who
having
wealthy
relations
had
been
better
educated
than
most
printers
was
a
tolerable
latinist
spoke
french
and
lov
reading
i
taught
him
and
a
friend
of
his
to
swim
at
twice
going
into
the
river
and
they
soon
became
good
swimmers
they
introduc
me
to
some
gentlemen
from
the
country
who
went
to
chelsea
by
water
to
see
the
college
and
don
saltero
curiosities
in
our
return
at
the
request
of
the
company
whose
curiosity
wygate
had
excited
i
stripped
and
leaped
into
the
river
and
swam
from
near
chelsea
to
blackfryar
performing
on
the
way
many
feats
of
activity
both
upon
and
under
water
that
surpris
and
pleas
those
to
whom
they
were
novelties
i
had
from
a
child
been
ever
delighted
with
this
exercise
had
studied
and
practis
all
thevenot
motions
and
positions
added
some
of
my
own
aiming
at
the
graceful
and
easy
as
well
as
the
useful
all
these
i
took
this
occasion
of
exhibiting
to
the
company
and
was
much
by
their
admiration
and
wygate
who
was
desirous
of
becoming
a
master
grew
more
and
more
attach
to
me
on
that
account
as
well
as
from
the
similarity
of
our
studies
he
at
length
proposed
to
me
travelling
all
over
europe
together
supporting
ourselves
everywhere
by
working
at
our
business
i
was
once
inclined
to
it
but
mentioning
it
to
my
good
friend
denham
with
whom
i
often
spent
an
hour
when
i
had
leisure
he
dissuaded
me
from
it
advising
me
to
think
only
of
returning
to
pennsilvania
which
he
was
now
about
to
do
i
must
record
one
trait
of
this
good
man
character
he
had
formerly
been
in
business
at
bristol
but
failed
in
debt
to
a
number
of
people
compounded
and
went
to
america
there
by
a
close
application
to
business
as
a
merchant
he
acquir
a
plentiful
fortune
in
a
few
years
returning
to
england
in
the
ship
with
me
he
invited
his
old
creditors
to
an
entertainment
at
which
he
thank
them
for
the
easy
composition
they
had
favored
him
with
and
when
they
expected
nothing
but
the
treat
every
man
at
the
first
remove
found
under
his
plate
an
order
on
a
banker
for
the
full
amount
of
the
unpaid
remainder
with
interest
he
now
told
me
he
was
about
to
return
to
philadelphia
and
should
carry
over
a
great
quantity
of
goods
in
order
to
open
a
store
there
he
propos
to
take
me
over
as
his
clerk
to
keep
his
books
in
which
he
would
instruct
me
copy
his
letters
and
attend
the
store
he
added
that
as
soon
as
i
should
be
acquainted
with
mercantile
business
he
would
promote
me
by
sending
me
with
a
cargo
of
flour
and
bread
to
the
west
indies
and
procure
me
commissions
from
others
which
would
be
profitable
and
if
i
manag
well
would
establish
me
handsomely
the
thing
pleas
me
for
i
was
grown
tired
of
london
remembered
with
pleasure
the
happy
months
i
had
spent
in
pennsylvania
and
wish
again
to
see
it
therefore
i
immediately
agreed
on
the
terms
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
pennsylvania
money
less
indeed
than
my
present
gettings
as
a
compositor
but
affording
a
better
prospect
i
now
took
leave
of
printing
as
i
thought
for
ever
and
was
daily
employed
in
my
new
business
going
about
with
denham
among
the
tradesmen
to
purchase
various
articles
and
seeing
them
pack
up
doing
errands
calling
upon
workmen
to
dispatch
etc
and
when
all
was
on
board
i
had
a
few
days
leisure
on
one
of
these
days
i
was
to
my
surprise
sent
for
by
a
great
man
i
knew
only
by
name
a
sir
william
wyndham
and
i
waited
upon
him
he
had
heard
by
some
means
or
other
of
my
swimming
from
chelsea
to
blackfriar
and
of
my
teaching
wygate
and
another
young
man
to
swim
in
a
few
hours
he
had
two
sons
about
to
set
out
on
their
travels
he
wish
to
have
them
first
taught
swimming
and
proposed
to
gratify
me
handsomely
if
i
would
teach
them
they
were
not
yet
come
to
town
and
my
stay
was
uncertain
so
i
could
not
undertake
it
but
from
this
incident
i
thought
it
likely
that
if
i
were
to
remain
in
england
and
open
a
i
might
get
a
good
deal
of
money
and
it
struck
me
so
strongly
that
had
the
overture
been
sooner
made
me
probably
i
should
not
so
soon
have
returned
to
america
after
many
years
you
and
i
had
something
of
more
importance
to
do
with
one
of
these
sons
of
sir
william
wyndham
become
earl
of
egremont
which
i
shall
mention
in
its
place
thus
i
spent
about
eighteen
months
in
london
most
part
of
the
time
i
work
hard
at
my
business
and
spent
but
little
upon
myself
except
in
seeing
plays
and
in
books
my
friend
ralph
had
kept
me
poor
he
owed
me
about
pounds
which
i
was
now
never
likely
to
receive
a
great
sum
out
of
my
small
earnings
i
lov
him
notwithstanding
for
he
had
many
amiable
qualities
i
had
by
no
means
improv
my
fortune
but
i
had
picked
up
some
very
ingenious
acquaintance
whose
conversation
was
of
great
advantage
to
me
and
i
had
read
considerably
we
sail
from
gravesend
on
the
of
july
for
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
i
refer
you
to
my
journal
where
you
will
find
them
all
minutely
related
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
that
journal
is
the
plan
to
be
found
in
it
which
i
formed
at
sea
for
regulating
my
future
conduct
in
life
it
is
the
more
remarkable
as
being
formed
when
i
was
so
young
and
yet
being
pretty
faithfully
adhered
to
quite
to
old
age
the
journal
was
printed
by
sparks
from
a
copy
made
at
reading
in
but
it
does
not
contain
the
ed
we
landed
in
philadelphia
on
the
of
october
where
i
found
sundry
alterations
keith
was
no
longer
governor
being
superseded
by
major
gordon
i
met
him
walking
the
streets
as
a
common
citizen
he
seem
a
little
asham
at
seeing
me
but
pass
without
saying
anything
i
should
have
been
as
much
asham
at
seeing
miss
read
had
not
her
friends
despairing
with
reason
of
my
return
after
the
receipt
of
my
letter
persuaded
her
to
marry
another
one
rogers
a
potter
which
was
done
in
my
absence
with
him
however
she
was
never
happy
and
soon
parted
from
him
refusing
to
cohabit
with
him
or
bear
his
name
it
being
now
said
that
he
had
another
wife
he
was
a
worthless
fellow
tho
an
excellent
workman
which
was
the
temptation
to
her
friends
he
got
into
debt
ran
away
in
or
went
to
the
west
indies
and
died
there
keimer
had
got
a
better
house
a
shop
well
supply
with
stationery
plenty
of
new
types
a
number
of
hands
tho
none
good
and
seem
to
have
a
great
deal
of
business
denham
took
a
store
in
where
we
open
our
goods
i
attended
the
business
diligently
studied
accounts
and
grew
in
a
little
time
expert
at
selling
we
lodg
and
boarded
together
he
counsell
me
as
a
father
having
a
sincere
regard
for
me
i
respected
and
lov
him
and
we
might
have
gone
on
together
very
happy
but
in
the
beginning
of
february
when
i
had
just
pass
my
year
we
both
were
taken
my
distemper
was
a
pleurisy
which
very
nearly
carried
me
off
i
suffered
a
good
deal
gave
up
the
point
in
my
own
mind
and
was
rather
disappointed
when
i
found
myself
recovering
regretting
in
some
degree
that
i
must
now
some
time
or
other
have
all
that
disagreeable
work
to
do
over
again
i
forget
what
his
distemper
was
it
held
him
a
long
time
and
at
length
carried
him
off
he
left
me
a
small
legacy
in
a
nuncupative
will
as
a
token
of
his
kindness
for
me
and
he
left
me
once
more
to
the
wide
world
for
the
store
was
taken
into
the
care
of
his
executors
and
my
employment
under
him
ended
my
holmes
being
now
at
philadelphia
advised
my
return
to
my
business
and
keimer
tempted
me
with
an
offer
of
large
wages
by
the
year
to
come
and
take
the
management
of
his
that
he
might
better
attend
his
stationer
shop
i
had
heard
a
bad
character
of
him
in
london
from
his
wife
and
her
friends
and
was
not
fond
of
having
any
more
to
do
with
him
i
tri
for
farther
employment
as
a
clerk
but
not
readily
meeting
with
any
i
clos
again
with
keimer
i
found
in
his
house
these
hands
hugh
meredith
a
welsh
pensilvanian
thirty
years
of
age
bred
to
country
work
honest
sensible
had
a
great
deal
of
solid
observation
was
something
of
a
reader
but
given
to
drink
stephen
potts
a
young
countryman
of
full
age
bred
to
the
same
of
uncommon
natural
parts
and
great
wit
and
humor
but
a
little
idle
these
he
had
agreed
with
at
extream
low
wages
per
week
to
be
rais
a
shilling
every
three
months
as
they
would
deserve
by
improving
in
their
business
and
the
expectation
of
these
high
wages
to
come
on
hereafter
was
what
he
had
drawn
them
in
with
meredith
was
to
work
at
press
potts
at
which
he
by
agreement
was
to
teach
them
though
he
knew
neither
one
nor
john
a
wild
irishman
brought
up
to
no
business
whose
service
for
four
years
keimer
had
purchased
from
the
captain
of
a
ship
he
too
was
to
be
made
a
pressman
george
webb
an
oxford
scholar
whose
time
for
four
years
he
had
likewise
bought
intending
him
for
a
compositor
of
whom
more
presently
and
david
harry
a
country
boy
whom
he
had
taken
apprentice
i
soon
perceiv
that
the
intention
of
engaging
me
at
wages
so
much
higher
than
he
had
been
us
to
give
was
to
have
these
raw
cheap
hands
form
thro
me
and
as
soon
as
i
had
instructed
them
then
they
being
all
articled
to
him
he
should
be
able
to
do
without
me
i
went
on
however
very
cheerfully
put
his
in
order
which
had
been
in
great
confusion
and
brought
his
hands
by
degrees
to
mind
their
business
and
to
do
it
better
it
was
an
odd
thing
to
find
an
oxford
scholar
in
the
situation
of
a
bought
servant
he
was
not
more
than
eighteen
years
of
age
and
gave
me
this
account
of
himself
that
he
was
born
in
gloucester
educated
at
a
there
had
been
distinguish
among
the
scholars
for
some
apparent
superiority
in
performing
his
part
when
they
exhibited
plays
belong
to
the
witty
club
there
and
had
written
some
pieces
in
prose
and
verse
which
were
printed
in
the
gloucester
newspapers
thence
he
was
sent
to
oxford
where
he
continued
about
a
year
but
not
well
satisfi
wishing
of
all
things
to
see
london
and
become
a
player
at
length
receiving
his
quarterly
allowance
of
fifteen
guineas
instead
of
discharging
his
debts
he
walk
out
of
town
hid
his
gown
in
a
furze
bush
and
footed
it
to
london
where
having
no
friend
to
advise
him
he
fell
into
bad
company
soon
spent
his
guineas
found
no
means
of
being
introduc
among
the
players
grew
necessitous
pawn
his
cloaths
and
wanted
bread
walking
the
street
very
hungry
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
a
crimp
bill
was
put
into
his
hand
offering
immediate
entertainment
and
encouragement
to
such
as
would
bind
themselves
to
serve
in
america
he
went
directly
sign
the
indentures
was
put
into
the
ship
and
came
over
never
writing
a
line
to
acquaint
his
friends
what
was
become
of
him
he
was
lively
witty
and
a
pleasant
companion
but
idle
thoughtless
and
imprudent
to
the
last
degree
john
the
irishman
soon
ran
away
with
the
rest
i
began
to
live
very
agreeably
for
they
all
respected
me
the
more
as
they
found
keimer
incapable
of
instructing
them
and
that
from
me
they
learned
something
daily
we
never
worked
on
saturday
that
being
keimer
sabbath
so
i
had
two
days
for
reading
my
acquaintance
with
ingenious
people
in
the
town
increased
keimer
himself
treated
me
with
great
civility
and
apparent
regard
and
nothing
now
made
me
uneasy
but
my
debt
to
vernon
which
i
was
yet
unable
to
pay
being
hitherto
but
a
poor
œconomist
he
however
kindly
made
no
demand
of
it
our
often
wanted
sorts
and
there
was
no
in
america
i
had
seen
types
cast
at
james
in
london
but
without
much
attention
to
the
manner
however
i
now
contrived
a
mould
made
use
of
the
letters
we
had
as
puncheons
struck
the
matrices
in
lead
and
thus
supply
in
a
pretty
tolerable
way
all
deficiencies
i
also
several
things
on
occasion
i
made
the
ink
i
was
warehouseman
and
everything
and
in
short
quite
a
factotum
but
however
serviceable
i
might
be
i
found
that
my
services
became
every
day
of
less
importance
as
the
other
hands
improv
in
the
business
and
when
keimer
paid
my
second
quarter
wages
he
let
me
know
that
he
felt
them
too
heavy
and
thought
i
should
make
an
abatement
he
grew
by
degrees
less
civil
put
on
more
of
the
master
frequently
found
fault
was
captious
and
seem
ready
for
an
outbreaking
i
went
on
nevertheless
with
a
good
deal
of
patience
thinking
that
his
encumber
circumstances
were
partly
the
cause
at
length
a
trifle
snapt
our
connections
for
a
great
noise
happening
near
the
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
matter
keimer
being
in
the
street
look
up
and
saw
me
call
out
to
me
in
a
loud
voice
and
angry
tone
to
mind
my
business
adding
some
reproachful
words
that
nettled
me
the
more
for
their
publicity
all
the
neighbors
who
were
looking
out
on
the
same
occasion
being
witnesses
how
i
was
treated
he
came
up
immediately
into
the
the
quarrel
high
words
pass
on
both
sides
he
gave
me
the
warning
we
had
stipulated
expressing
a
wish
that
he
had
not
been
oblig
to
so
long
a
warning
i
told
him
his
wish
was
unnecessary
for
i
would
leave
him
that
instant
and
so
taking
my
hat
walk
out
of
doors
desiring
meredith
whom
i
saw
below
to
take
care
of
some
things
i
left
and
bring
them
to
my
lodgings
meredith
came
accordingly
in
the
evening
when
we
talked
my
affair
over
he
had
conceiv
a
great
regard
for
me
and
was
very
unwilling
that
i
should
leave
the
house
while
he
remain
in
it
he
dissuaded
me
from
returning
to
my
native
country
which
i
began
to
think
of
he
reminded
me
that
keimer
was
in
debt
for
all
he
possess
that
his
creditors
began
to
be
uneasy
that
he
kept
his
shop
miserably
sold
often
without
profit
for
ready
money
and
often
trusted
without
keeping
accounts
that
he
must
therefore
fall
which
would
make
a
vacancy
i
might
profit
of
i
objected
my
want
of
money
he
then
let
me
know
that
his
father
had
a
high
opinion
of
me
and
from
some
discourse
that
had
pass
between
them
he
was
sure
would
advance
money
to
set
us
up
if
i
would
enter
into
partnership
with
him
my
time
says
he
will
be
out
with
keimer
in
the
spring
by
that
time
we
may
have
our
press
and
types
in
from
london
i
am
sensible
i
am
no
workman
if
you
like
it
your
skill
in
the
business
shall
be
set
against
the
stock
i
furnish
and
we
will
share
the
profits
equally
the
proposal
was
agreeable
and
i
consented
his
father
was
in
town
and
approv
of
it
the
more
as
he
saw
i
had
great
influence
with
his
son
had
prevail
on
him
to
abstain
long
from
and
he
might
break
him
off
that
wretched
habit
entirely
when
we
came
to
be
so
closely
connected
i
gave
an
inventory
to
the
father
who
carry
it
to
a
merchant
the
things
were
sent
for
the
secret
was
to
be
kept
till
they
should
arrive
and
in
the
mean
time
i
was
to
get
work
if
i
could
at
the
other
but
i
found
no
vacancy
there
and
so
remain
idle
a
few
days
when
keimer
on
a
prospect
of
being
to
print
some
paper
money
in
new
jersey
which
would
require
cuts
and
various
types
that
i
only
could
supply
and
apprehending
bradford
might
engage
me
and
get
the
jobb
from
him
sent
me
a
very
civil
message
that
old
friends
should
not
part
for
a
few
words
the
effect
of
sudden
passion
and
wishing
me
to
return
meredith
persuaded
me
to
comply
as
it
would
give
more
opportunity
for
his
improvement
under
my
daily
instructions
so
i
return
and
we
went
on
more
smoothly
than
for
some
time
before
the
new
jersey
jobb
was
obtain
i
contriv
a
copperplate
press
for
it
the
first
that
had
been
seen
in
the
country
i
cut
several
ornaments
and
checks
for
the
bills
we
went
together
to
burlington
where
i
executed
the
whole
to
satisfaction
and
he
received
so
large
a
sum
for
the
work
as
to
be
enabled
thereby
to
keep
his
head
much
longer
above
water
at
burlington
i
made
an
acquaintance
with
many
principal
people
of
the
province
several
of
them
had
been
appointed
by
the
assembly
a
committee
to
attend
the
press
and
take
care
that
no
more
bills
were
printed
than
the
law
directed
they
were
therefore
by
turns
constantly
with
us
and
generally
he
who
attended
brought
with
him
a
friend
or
two
for
company
my
mind
having
been
much
more
improv
by
reading
than
keimer
i
suppose
it
was
for
that
reason
my
conversation
seem
to
be
more
valu
they
had
me
to
their
houses
introduced
me
to
their
friends
and
me
much
civility
while
he
tho
the
master
was
a
little
neglected
in
truth
he
was
an
odd
fish
ignorant
of
common
life
fond
of
rudely
opposing
receiv
opinions
slovenly
to
extream
dirtiness
enthusiastic
in
some
points
of
religion
and
a
little
knavish
withal
we
continu
there
near
three
months
and
by
that
time
i
could
reckon
among
my
acquired
friends
judge
allen
samuel
bustill
the
secretary
of
the
province
isaac
pearson
joseph
cooper
and
several
of
the
smiths
members
of
assembly
and
isaac
decow
the
the
latter
was
a
shrewd
sagacious
old
man
who
told
me
that
he
began
for
himself
when
young
by
wheeling
clay
for
the
learned
to
write
after
he
was
of
age
carri
the
chain
for
surveyors
who
taught
him
surveying
and
he
had
now
by
his
industry
acquir
a
good
estate
and
says
he
i
foresee
that
you
will
soon
work
this
man
out
of
business
and
make
a
fortune
in
it
at
philadelphia
he
had
not
then
the
least
intimation
of
my
intention
to
set
up
there
or
anywhere
these
friends
were
afterwards
of
great
use
to
me
as
i
occasionally
was
to
some
of
them
they
all
continued
their
regard
for
me
as
long
as
they
lived
before
i
enter
upon
my
public
appearance
in
business
it
may
be
well
to
let
you
know
the
then
state
of
my
mind
with
regard
to
my
principles
and
morals
that
you
may
see
how
far
those
influenc
the
future
events
of
my
life
my
parents
had
early
given
me
religious
impressions
and
brought
me
through
my
childhood
piously
in
the
dissenting
way
but
i
was
scarce
fifteen
when
after
doubting
by
turns
of
several
points
as
i
found
them
disputed
in
the
different
books
i
read
i
began
to
doubt
of
revelation
itself
some
books
against
deism
fell
into
my
hands
they
were
said
to
be
the
substance
of
sermons
preached
at
boyle
lectures
it
happened
that
they
wrought
an
effect
on
me
quite
contrary
to
what
was
intended
by
them
for
the
arguments
of
the
deists
which
were
quoted
to
be
refuted
appeared
to
me
much
stronger
than
the
refutations
in
short
i
soon
became
a
thorough
deist
my
arguments
perverted
some
others
particularly
collins
and
ralph
but
each
of
them
having
afterwards
wrong
me
greatly
without
the
least
compunction
and
recollecting
keith
conduct
towards
me
who
was
another
freethinker
and
my
own
towards
vernon
and
miss
read
which
at
times
gave
me
great
trouble
i
began
to
suspect
that
this
doctrine
tho
it
might
be
true
was
not
very
useful
my
london
pamphlet
which
had
for
its
motto
these
lines
of
dryden
whatever
is
is
right
though
purblind
man
sees
but
a
part
o
the
chain
the
nearest
link
his
eyes
not
carrying
to
the
equal
beam
that
poises
all
above
and
from
the
attributes
of
god
his
infinite
wisdom
goodness
and
power
concluded
that
nothing
could
possibly
be
wrong
in
the
world
and
that
vice
and
virtue
were
empty
distinctions
no
such
things
existing
appear
now
not
so
clever
a
performance
as
i
once
thought
it
and
i
doubted
whether
some
error
had
not
insinuated
itself
unperceiv
into
my
argument
so
as
to
infect
all
that
follow
as
is
common
in
metaphysical
reasonings
i
grew
convinc
that
truth
sincerity
and
integrity
in
dealings
between
man
and
man
were
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
felicity
of
life
and
i
form
written
resolutions
which
still
remain
in
my
journal
book
to
practice
them
ever
while
i
lived
revelation
had
indeed
no
weight
with
me
as
such
but
i
entertain
an
opinion
that
though
certain
actions
might
not
be
bad
because
they
were
forbidden
by
it
or
good
because
it
commanded
them
yet
probably
these
actions
might
be
forbidden
because
they
were
bad
for
us
or
commanded
because
they
were
beneficial
to
us
in
their
own
natures
all
the
circumstances
of
things
considered
and
this
persuasion
with
the
kind
hand
of
providence
or
some
guardian
angel
or
accidental
favorable
circumstances
and
situations
or
all
together
preserved
me
thro
this
dangerous
time
of
youth
and
the
hazardous
situations
i
was
sometimes
in
among
strangers
remote
from
the
eye
and
advice
of
my
father
without
any
willful
gross
immorality
or
injustice
that
might
have
been
expected
from
my
want
of
religion
i
say
willful
because
the
instances
i
have
mentioned
had
something
of
necessity
in
them
from
my
youth
inexperience
and
the
knavery
of
others
i
had
therefore
a
tolerable
character
to
begin
the
world
with
i
valued
it
properly
and
determin
to
preserve
it
we
had
not
been
long
return
to
philadelphia
before
the
new
types
arriv
from
london
we
settled
with
keimer
and
left
him
by
his
consent
before
he
heard
of
it
we
found
a
house
to
hire
near
the
market
and
took
it
to
lessen
the
rent
which
was
then
but
pounds
a
year
tho
i
have
since
known
it
to
let
for
seventy
we
took
in
thomas
godfrey
a
glazier
and
his
family
who
were
to
pay
a
considerable
part
of
it
to
us
and
we
to
board
with
them
we
had
scarce
opened
our
letters
and
put
our
press
in
order
before
george
house
an
acquaintance
of
mine
brought
a
countryman
to
us
whom
he
had
met
in
the
street
inquiring
for
a
printer
all
our
cash
was
now
expended
in
the
variety
of
particulars
we
had
been
obliged
to
procure
and
this
countryman
five
shillings
being
our
and
coming
so
seasonably
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
any
crown
i
have
since
earned
and
the
gratitude
i
felt
toward
house
has
made
me
often
more
ready
than
perhaps
i
should
otherwise
have
been
to
assist
young
beginners
there
are
croakers
in
every
country
always
boding
its
ruin
such
a
one
then
lived
in
philadelphia
a
person
of
note
an
elderly
man
with
a
wise
look
and
a
very
grave
manner
of
speaking
his
name
was
samuel
mickle
this
gentleman
a
stranger
to
me
stopt
one
day
at
my
door
and
asked
me
if
i
was
the
young
man
who
had
lately
opened
a
new
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
said
he
was
sorry
for
me
because
it
was
an
expensive
undertaking
and
the
expense
would
be
lost
for
philadelphia
was
a
sinking
place
the
people
already
or
near
being
so
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
such
as
new
buildings
and
the
rise
of
rents
being
to
his
certain
knowledge
fallacious
for
they
were
in
fact
among
the
things
that
would
soon
ruin
us
and
he
gave
me
such
a
detail
of
misfortunes
now
existing
or
that
were
soon
to
exist
that
he
left
me
half
melancholy
had
i
known
him
before
i
engaged
in
this
business
probably
i
never
should
have
done
it
this
man
continued
to
live
in
this
decaying
place
and
to
declaim
in
the
same
strain
refusing
for
many
years
to
buy
a
house
there
because
all
was
going
to
destruction
and
at
last
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
give
five
times
as
much
for
one
as
he
might
have
bought
it
for
when
he
first
began
his
croaking
i
should
have
mentioned
before
that
in
the
autumn
of
the
preceding
year
i
had
form
most
of
my
ingenious
acquaintance
into
a
club
of
mutual
improvement
which
we
called
the
junto
we
met
on
friday
evenings
the
rules
that
i
drew
up
required
that
every
member
in
his
turn
should
produce
one
or
more
queries
on
any
point
of
morals
politics
or
natural
philosophy
to
be
discuss
by
the
company
and
once
in
three
months
produce
and
read
an
essay
of
his
own
writing
on
any
subject
he
pleased
our
debates
were
to
be
under
the
direction
of
a
president
and
to
be
conducted
in
the
sincere
spirit
of
inquiry
after
truth
without
fondness
for
dispute
or
desire
of
victory
and
to
prevent
warmth
all
expressions
of
positiveness
in
opinions
or
direct
contradiction
were
after
some
time
made
contraband
and
prohibited
under
small
pecuniary
penalties
the
first
members
were
joseph
breintnal
a
copyer
of
deeds
for
the
scriveners
a
friendly
man
a
great
lover
of
poetry
reading
all
he
could
meet
with
and
writing
some
that
was
tolerable
very
ingenious
in
many
little
nicknackeries
and
of
sensible
conversation
thomas
godfrey
a
mathematician
great
in
his
way
and
afterward
inventor
of
what
is
now
called
hadley
quadrant
but
he
knew
little
out
of
his
way
and
was
not
a
pleasing
companion
as
like
most
great
mathematicians
i
have
met
with
he
expected
universal
precision
in
everything
said
or
was
for
ever
denying
or
distinguishing
upon
trifles
to
the
disturbance
of
all
conversation
he
soon
left
us
nicholas
scull
a
surveyor
afterwards
who
books
and
sometimes
made
a
few
verses
william
parsons
bred
a
shoemaker
but
loving
reading
had
acquir
a
considerable
share
of
mathematics
which
he
first
studied
with
a
view
to
astrology
that
he
afterwards
laught
at
it
he
also
became
william
maugridge
a
joiner
a
most
exquisite
mechanic
and
a
solid
sensible
man
hugh
meredith
stephen
potts
and
george
webb
i
have
before
robert
grace
a
young
gentleman
of
some
fortune
generous
lively
and
witty
a
lover
of
punning
and
of
his
friends
and
william
coleman
then
a
merchant
clerk
about
my
age
who
had
the
coolest
clearest
head
the
best
heart
and
the
exactest
morals
of
almost
any
man
i
ever
met
with
he
became
afterwards
a
merchant
of
great
note
and
one
of
our
provincial
judges
our
friendship
continued
without
interruption
to
his
death
upward
of
forty
years
and
the
club
continued
almost
as
long
and
was
the
best
school
of
philosophy
morality
and
politics
that
then
existed
in
the
province
for
our
queries
which
were
read
the
week
preceding
their
discussion
put
us
upon
reading
with
attention
upon
the
several
subjects
that
we
might
speak
more
to
the
purpose
and
here
too
we
acquired
better
habits
of
conversation
every
thing
being
studied
in
our
rules
which
might
prevent
our
disgusting
each
other
from
hence
the
long
continuance
of
the
club
which
i
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
speak
further
of
hereafter
but
my
giving
this
account
of
it
here
is
to
show
something
of
the
interest
i
had
every
one
of
these
exerting
themselves
in
recommending
business
to
us
breintnal
particularly
procur
us
from
the
quakers
the
printing
forty
sheets
of
their
history
the
rest
being
to
be
done
by
keimer
and
upon
this
we
work
exceedingly
hard
for
the
price
was
low
it
was
a
folio
pro
patria
size
in
pica
with
long
primer
notes
i
compos
of
it
a
sheet
a
day
and
meredith
worked
it
off
at
press
it
was
often
eleven
at
night
and
sometimes
later
before
i
had
finished
my
distribution
for
the
next
day
work
for
the
little
jobbs
sent
in
by
our
other
friends
now
and
then
put
us
back
but
so
determin
i
was
to
continue
doing
a
sheet
a
day
of
the
folio
that
one
night
when
having
impos
my
forms
i
thought
my
day
work
over
one
of
them
by
accident
was
broken
and
two
pages
reduced
to
pi
i
immediately
distributed
and
compos
it
over
again
before
i
went
to
bed
and
this
industry
visible
to
our
neighbors
began
to
give
us
character
and
credit
particularly
i
was
told
that
mention
being
made
of
the
new
at
the
merchants
club
the
general
opinion
was
that
it
must
fail
there
being
already
two
printers
in
the
place
keimer
and
bradford
but
baird
whom
you
and
i
saw
many
years
after
at
his
native
place
andrew
in
scotland
gave
a
contrary
opinion
for
the
industry
of
that
franklin
says
he
is
superior
to
any
thing
i
ever
saw
of
the
kind
i
see
him
still
at
work
when
i
go
home
from
club
and
he
is
at
work
again
before
his
neighbors
are
out
of
bed
this
struck
the
rest
and
we
soon
after
had
offers
from
one
of
them
to
supply
us
with
stationery
but
as
yet
we
did
not
chuse
to
engage
in
shop
business
i
mention
this
industry
the
more
particularly
and
the
more
freely
it
seems
to
be
talking
in
my
own
praise
that
those
of
my
posterity
who
shall
read
it
may
know
the
use
of
that
virtue
when
they
see
its
effects
in
my
favour
throughout
this
relation
george
webb
who
had
found
a
female
friend
that
lent
him
wherewith
to
purchase
his
time
of
keimer
now
came
to
offer
himself
as
a
journeyman
to
us
we
could
not
then
imploy
him
but
i
foolishly
let
him
know
as
a
secret
that
i
soon
intended
to
begin
a
newspaper
and
might
then
have
work
for
him
my
hopes
of
success
as
i
told
him
were
founded
on
this
that
the
then
only
newspaper
printed
by
bradford
was
a
paltry
thing
wretchedly
manag
no
way
entertaining
and
yet
was
profitable
to
him
i
therefore
thought
a
good
paper
would
scarcely
fail
of
good
encouragement
i
requested
webb
not
to
mention
it
but
he
told
it
to
keimer
who
immediately
to
be
beforehand
with
me
published
proposals
for
printing
one
himself
on
which
webb
was
to
be
employ
i
resented
this
and
to
counteract
them
as
i
could
not
yet
begin
our
paper
i
wrote
several
pieces
of
entertainment
for
bradford
paper
under
the
title
of
the
busy
body
which
breintnal
continu
some
months
by
this
means
the
attention
of
the
publick
was
fixed
on
that
paper
and
proposals
which
we
burlesqu
and
ridicul
were
disregarded
he
began
his
paper
however
and
after
carrying
it
on
three
quarters
of
a
year
with
at
most
only
ninety
subscribers
he
offered
it
to
me
for
a
trifle
and
i
having
been
ready
some
time
to
go
on
with
it
took
it
in
hand
directly
and
it
prov
in
a
few
years
extremely
profitable
to
me
i
perceive
that
i
am
apt
to
speak
in
the
singular
number
though
our
partnership
still
continu
the
reason
may
be
that
in
fact
the
whole
management
of
the
business
lay
upon
me
meredith
was
no
compositor
a
poor
pressman
and
seldom
sober
my
friends
lamented
my
connection
with
him
but
i
was
to
make
the
best
of
it
our
first
papers
made
a
quite
different
appearance
from
any
before
in
the
province
a
better
type
and
better
printed
but
some
spirited
remarks
of
my
writing
on
the
dispute
then
going
on
between
governor
burnet
and
the
massachusetts
assembly
struck
the
principal
people
occasioned
the
paper
and
the
manager
of
it
to
be
much
talk
of
and
in
a
few
weeks
brought
them
all
to
be
our
subscribers
their
example
was
follow
by
many
and
our
number
went
on
growing
continually
this
was
one
of
the
first
good
effects
of
my
having
learnt
a
little
to
scribble
another
was
that
the
leading
men
seeing
a
newspaper
now
in
the
hands
of
one
who
could
also
handle
a
pen
thought
it
convenient
to
oblige
and
encourage
me
bradford
still
printed
the
votes
and
laws
and
other
publick
business
he
had
printed
an
address
of
the
house
to
the
governor
in
a
coarse
blundering
manner
we
reprinted
it
elegantly
and
correctly
and
sent
one
to
every
member
they
were
sensible
of
the
difference
it
strengthened
the
hands
of
our
friends
in
the
house
and
they
voted
us
their
printers
for
the
year
ensuing
among
my
friends
in
the
house
i
must
not
forget
hamilton
before
mentioned
who
was
then
returned
from
england
and
had
a
seat
in
it
he
interested
himself
for
me
strongly
in
that
instance
as
he
did
in
many
others
afterward
continuing
his
patronage
till
his
death
i
got
his
son
once
marg
note
vernon
about
this
time
put
me
in
mind
of
the
debt
i
ow
him
but
did
not
press
me
i
wrote
him
an
ingenuous
letter
of
acknowledgment
crav
his
forbearance
a
little
longer
which
he
allow
me
and
as
soon
as
i
was
able
i
paid
the
principal
with
interest
and
many
thanks
so
that
erratum
was
in
some
degree
corrected
but
now
another
difficulty
came
upon
me
which
i
had
never
the
least
reason
to
expect
meredith
father
who
was
to
have
paid
for
our
according
to
the
expectations
given
me
was
able
to
advance
only
one
hundred
pounds
currency
which
had
been
paid
and
a
hundred
more
was
due
to
the
merchant
who
grew
impatient
and
su
us
all
we
gave
bail
but
saw
that
if
the
money
could
not
be
rais
in
time
the
suit
must
soon
come
to
a
judgment
and
execution
and
our
hopeful
prospects
must
with
us
be
ruined
as
the
press
and
letters
must
be
sold
for
payment
perhaps
at
half
price
in
this
distress
two
true
friends
whose
kindness
i
have
never
forgotten
nor
ever
shall
forget
while
i
can
remember
any
thing
came
to
me
separately
unknown
to
each
other
and
without
any
application
from
me
offering
each
of
them
to
advance
me
all
the
money
that
should
be
necessary
to
enable
me
to
take
the
whole
business
upon
myself
if
that
should
be
practicable
but
they
did
not
like
my
continuing
the
partnership
with
meredith
who
as
they
said
was
often
seen
drunk
in
the
streets
and
playing
at
low
games
in
alehouses
much
to
our
discredit
these
two
friends
were
william
coleman
and
robert
grace
i
told
them
i
could
not
propose
a
separation
while
any
prospect
of
the
merediths
fulfilling
their
part
of
our
agreement
because
i
thought
myself
under
great
obligations
to
them
for
what
they
had
done
and
would
do
if
they
could
but
if
they
finally
fail
in
their
performance
and
our
partnership
must
be
dissolv
i
should
then
think
myself
at
liberty
to
accept
the
assistance
of
my
friends
thus
the
matter
rested
for
some
time
when
i
said
to
my
partner
perhaps
your
father
is
dissatisfied
at
the
part
you
have
undertaken
in
this
affair
of
ours
and
is
unwilling
to
advance
for
you
and
me
what
he
would
for
you
alone
if
that
is
the
case
tell
me
and
i
will
resign
the
whole
to
you
and
go
about
my
business
no
said
he
my
father
has
really
been
disappointed
and
is
really
unable
and
i
am
unwilling
to
distress
him
farther
i
see
this
is
a
business
i
am
not
fit
for
i
was
bred
a
farmer
and
it
was
a
folly
in
me
to
come
to
town
and
put
myself
at
thirty
years
of
age
an
apprentice
to
learn
a
new
trade
many
of
our
welsh
people
are
going
to
settle
in
north
carolina
where
land
is
cheap
i
am
inclin
to
go
with
them
and
follow
my
old
employment
you
may
find
friends
to
assist
you
if
you
will
take
the
debts
of
the
company
upon
you
return
to
my
father
the
hundred
pound
he
has
advanced
pay
my
little
personal
debts
and
give
me
thirty
pounds
and
a
new
saddle
i
will
relinquish
the
partnership
and
leave
the
whole
in
your
hands
i
agreed
to
this
proposal
it
was
drawn
up
in
writing
sign
and
immediately
i
gave
him
what
he
demanded
and
he
went
soon
after
to
carolina
from
whence
he
sent
me
next
year
two
long
letters
containing
the
best
account
that
had
been
given
of
that
country
the
climate
the
soil
husbandry
for
in
those
matters
he
was
very
judicious
i
printed
them
in
the
papers
and
they
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
publick
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
recurr
to
my
two
friends
and
because
i
would
not
give
an
unkind
preference
to
either
i
took
half
of
what
each
had
offered
and
i
wanted
of
one
and
half
of
the
other
paid
off
the
company
debts
and
went
on
with
the
business
in
my
own
name
advertising
that
the
partnership
was
dissolved
i
think
this
was
in
or
about
the
year
about
this
time
there
was
a
cry
among
the
people
for
more
paper
money
only
fifteen
thousand
pounds
being
extant
in
the
province
and
that
soon
to
be
sunk
the
wealthy
inhabitants
oppos
any
addition
being
against
all
paper
currency
from
an
apprehension
that
it
would
depreciate
as
it
had
done
in
new
england
to
the
prejudice
of
all
creditors
we
had
discuss
this
point
in
our
junto
where
i
was
on
the
side
of
an
addition
being
persuaded
that
the
first
small
sum
struck
in
had
done
much
good
by
increasing
the
trade
employment
and
number
of
inhabitants
in
the
province
since
i
now
saw
all
the
old
houses
inhabited
and
many
new
ones
building
whereas
i
remembered
well
that
when
i
first
walk
about
the
streets
of
philadelphia
eating
my
roll
i
saw
most
of
the
houses
in
between
second
and
front
streets
with
bills
on
their
doors
to
be
let
and
many
likewise
in
and
other
streets
which
made
me
then
think
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
deserting
it
one
after
another
our
debates
possess
me
so
fully
of
the
subject
that
i
wrote
and
printed
an
anonymous
pamphlet
on
it
entitled
the
nature
and
necessity
of
a
paper
currency
it
was
well
receiv
by
the
common
people
in
general
but
the
rich
men
dislik
it
for
it
increas
and
the
clamor
for
more
money
and
they
happening
to
have
no
writers
among
them
that
were
able
to
answer
it
their
opposition
slacken
and
the
point
was
carried
by
a
majority
in
the
house
my
friends
there
who
conceiv
i
had
been
of
some
service
thought
fit
to
reward
me
by
employing
me
in
printing
the
money
a
very
profitable
jobb
and
a
great
help
to
me
this
was
another
advantage
gain
by
my
being
able
to
write
the
utility
of
this
currency
became
by
time
and
experience
so
evident
as
never
afterwards
to
be
much
disputed
so
that
it
grew
soon
to
thousand
pounds
and
in
to
eighty
thousand
pounds
since
which
it
arose
during
war
to
upwards
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
trade
building
and
inhabitants
all
the
while
increasing
tho
i
now
think
there
are
limits
beyond
which
the
quantity
may
be
hurtful
i
soon
after
obtain
thro
my
friend
hamilton
the
printing
of
the
newcastle
paper
money
another
profitable
jobb
as
i
then
thought
it
small
things
appearing
great
to
those
in
small
circumstances
and
these
to
me
were
really
great
advantages
as
they
were
great
encouragements
he
procured
for
me
also
the
printing
of
the
laws
and
votes
of
that
government
which
continu
in
my
hands
as
long
as
i
follow
the
business
i
now
open
a
little
stationer
shop
i
had
in
it
blanks
of
all
sorts
the
correctest
that
ever
appear
among
us
being
assisted
in
that
by
my
friend
breintnal
i
had
also
paper
parchment
chapmen
books
etc
one
whitemash
a
compositor
i
had
known
in
london
an
excellent
workman
now
came
to
me
and
work
with
me
constantly
and
diligently
and
i
took
an
apprentice
the
son
of
aquila
rose
i
began
now
gradually
to
pay
off
the
debt
i
was
under
for
the
in
order
to
secure
my
credit
and
character
as
a
tradesman
i
took
care
not
only
to
be
in
reality
industrious
and
frugal
but
to
avoid
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
i
drest
plainly
i
was
seen
at
no
places
of
idle
diversion
i
never
went
out
a
fishing
or
shooting
a
book
indeed
sometimes
debauch
me
from
my
work
but
that
was
seldom
snug
and
gave
no
scandal
and
to
show
that
i
was
not
above
my
business
i
sometimes
brought
home
the
paper
i
purchas
at
the
stores
thro
the
streets
on
a
wheelbarrow
thus
being
esteem
an
industrious
thriving
young
man
and
paying
duly
for
what
i
bought
the
merchants
who
imported
stationery
solicited
my
custom
others
proposed
supplying
me
with
books
and
i
went
on
swimmingly
in
the
mean
time
keimer
credit
and
business
declining
daily
he
was
at
last
forc
to
sell
his
to
satisfy
his
creditors
he
went
to
barbadoes
and
there
lived
some
years
in
very
poor
circumstances
his
apprentice
david
harry
whom
i
had
instructed
while
i
work
with
him
set
up
in
his
place
at
philadelphia
having
bought
his
materials
i
was
at
first
apprehensive
of
a
powerful
rival
in
harry
as
his
friends
were
very
able
and
had
a
good
deal
of
interest
i
therefore
propos
a
partnership
to
him
which
he
fortunately
for
me
rejected
with
scorn
he
was
very
proud
dress
like
a
gentleman
liv
expensively
took
much
diversion
and
pleasure
abroad
ran
in
debt
and
neglected
his
business
upon
which
all
business
left
him
and
finding
nothing
to
do
he
followed
keimer
to
barbadoes
taking
the
with
him
there
this
apprentice
employ
his
former
master
as
a
journeyman
they
quarrel
often
harry
went
continually
behindhand
and
at
length
was
forc
to
sell
his
types
and
return
to
his
country
work
in
pensilvania
the
person
that
bought
them
employ
keimer
to
use
them
but
in
a
few
years
he
died
there
remained
now
no
competitor
with
me
at
philadelphia
but
the
old
one
bradford
who
was
rich
and
easy
did
a
little
printing
now
and
then
by
straggling
hands
but
was
not
very
anxious
about
the
business
however
as
he
kept
the
it
was
imagined
he
had
better
opportunities
of
obtaining
news
his
paper
was
thought
a
better
distributer
of
advertisements
than
mine
and
therefore
had
many
more
which
was
a
profitable
thing
to
him
and
a
disadvantage
to
me
for
i
did
indeed
receive
and
send
papers
by
the
post
yet
the
publick
opinion
was
otherwise
for
what
i
did
send
was
by
bribing
the
riders
who
took
them
privately
bradford
being
unkind
enough
to
forbid
it
which
occasion
some
resentment
on
my
part
and
i
thought
so
meanly
of
him
for
it
that
when
i
afterward
came
into
his
situation
i
took
care
never
to
imitate
it
i
had
hitherto
continu
to
board
with
godfrey
who
lived
in
part
of
my
house
with
his
wife
and
children
and
had
one
side
of
the
shop
for
his
glazier
business
tho
he
worked
little
being
always
absorbed
in
his
mathematics
godfrey
projected
a
match
for
me
with
a
daughter
took
opportunities
of
bringing
us
often
together
till
a
serious
courtship
on
my
part
ensu
the
girl
being
in
herself
very
deserving
the
old
folks
encourag
me
by
continual
invitations
to
supper
and
by
leaving
us
together
till
at
length
it
was
time
to
explain
godfrey
manag
our
little
treaty
i
let
her
know
that
i
expected
as
much
money
with
their
daughter
as
would
pay
off
my
remaining
debt
for
the
which
i
believe
was
not
then
above
a
hundred
pounds
she
brought
me
word
they
had
no
such
sum
to
spare
i
said
they
might
mortgage
their
house
in
the
the
answer
to
this
after
some
days
was
that
they
did
not
approve
the
match
that
on
inquiry
of
bradford
they
had
been
inform
the
printing
business
was
not
a
profitable
one
the
types
would
soon
be
worn
out
and
more
wanted
that
keimer
and
harry
had
failed
one
after
the
other
and
i
should
probably
soon
follow
them
and
therefore
i
was
forbidden
the
house
and
the
daughter
shut
up
whether
this
was
a
real
change
of
sentiment
or
only
artifice
on
a
supposition
of
our
being
too
far
engaged
in
affection
to
retract
and
therefore
that
we
should
steal
a
marriage
which
would
leave
them
at
liberty
to
give
or
withhold
what
they
pleas
i
know
not
but
i
suspected
the
latter
resented
it
and
went
no
more
godfrey
brought
me
afterward
some
more
favorable
accounts
of
their
disposition
and
would
have
drawn
me
on
again
but
i
declared
absolutely
my
resolution
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
that
family
this
was
resented
by
the
godfreys
we
differ
and
they
removed
leaving
me
the
whole
house
and
i
resolved
to
take
no
more
inmates
but
this
affair
having
turned
my
thoughts
to
marriage
i
look
round
me
and
made
overtures
of
acquaintance
in
other
places
but
soon
found
that
the
business
of
a
printer
being
generally
thought
a
poor
one
i
was
not
to
expect
money
with
a
wife
unless
with
such
a
one
as
i
should
not
otherwise
think
agreeable
in
the
mean
time
that
passion
of
youth
hurried
me
frequently
into
intrigues
with
low
women
that
fell
in
my
way
which
were
attended
with
some
expense
and
great
inconvenience
besides
a
continual
risque
to
my
health
by
a
distemper
which
of
all
things
i
dreaded
though
by
great
good
luck
i
escaped
it
a
friendly
correspondence
as
neighbors
and
old
acquaintances
had
continued
between
me
and
read
family
who
all
had
a
regard
for
me
from
the
time
of
my
first
lodging
in
their
house
i
was
often
invited
there
and
consulted
in
their
affairs
wherein
i
sometimes
was
of
service
i
poor
miss
read
unfortunate
situation
who
was
generally
dejected
seldom
cheerful
and
avoided
company
i
considered
my
giddiness
and
inconstancy
when
in
london
as
in
a
great
degree
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
tho
the
mother
was
good
enough
to
think
the
fault
more
her
own
than
mine
as
she
had
prevented
our
marrying
before
i
went
thither
and
persuaded
the
other
match
in
my
absence
our
mutual
affection
was
revived
but
there
were
now
great
objections
to
our
union
the
match
was
indeed
looked
upon
as
invalid
a
preceding
wife
being
said
to
be
living
in
england
but
this
could
not
easily
be
prov
because
of
the
distance
and
tho
there
was
a
report
of
his
death
it
was
not
certain
then
tho
it
should
be
true
he
had
left
many
debts
which
his
successor
might
be
call
upon
to
pay
we
ventured
however
over
all
these
difficulties
and
i
took
her
to
wife
september
none
of
the
inconveniences
happened
that
we
had
apprehended
she
proved
a
good
and
faithful
helpmate
assisted
me
much
by
attending
the
shop
we
throve
together
and
have
ever
mutually
endeavored
to
make
each
other
happy
thus
i
corrected
that
great
erratum
as
well
as
i
could
about
this
time
our
club
meeting
not
at
a
tavern
but
in
a
little
room
of
grace
set
apart
for
that
purpose
a
proposition
was
made
by
me
that
since
our
books
were
often
referr
to
in
our
disquisitions
upon
the
queries
it
might
be
convenient
to
us
to
have
them
altogether
where
we
met
that
upon
occasion
they
might
be
consulted
and
by
thus
clubbing
our
books
to
a
common
library
we
should
while
we
lik
to
keep
them
together
have
each
of
us
the
advantage
of
using
the
books
of
all
the
other
members
which
would
be
nearly
as
beneficial
as
if
each
owned
the
whole
it
was
lik
and
agreed
to
and
we
fill
one
end
of
the
room
with
such
books
as
we
could
best
spare
the
number
was
not
so
great
as
we
expected
and
tho
they
had
been
of
great
use
yet
some
inconveniences
occurring
for
want
of
due
care
of
them
the
collection
after
about
a
year
was
separated
and
each
took
his
books
home
again
and
now
i
set
on
foot
my
first
project
of
a
public
nature
that
for
a
subscription
library
i
drew
up
the
proposals
got
them
put
into
form
by
our
great
scrivener
brockden
and
by
the
help
of
my
friends
in
the
junto
procured
fifty
subscribers
of
forty
shillings
each
to
begin
with
and
ten
shillings
a
year
for
fifty
years
the
term
our
company
was
to
continue
we
afterwards
obtain
a
charter
the
company
being
increased
to
one
hundred
this
was
the
mother
of
all
the
north
american
subscription
libraries
now
so
numerous
it
is
become
a
great
thing
itself
and
continually
increasing
these
libraries
have
improved
the
general
conversation
of
the
americans
made
the
common
tradesmen
and
farmers
as
intelligent
as
most
gentlemen
from
other
countries
and
perhaps
have
contributed
in
some
degree
to
the
stand
so
generally
made
throughout
the
colonies
in
defense
of
their
privileges
memo
thus
far
was
written
with
the
intention
express
in
the
beginning
and
therefore
contains
several
little
family
anecdotes
of
no
importance
to
others
what
follows
was
written
many
years
after
in
compliance
with
the
advice
contain
in
these
letters
and
accordingly
intended
for
the
public
the
affairs
of
the
revolution
occasion
the
interruption
letter
from
abel
james
with
notes
of
my
life
received
in
paris
my
dear
and
honored
friend
i
have
often
been
desirous
of
writing
to
thee
but
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
thought
that
the
letter
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
british
lest
some
printer
or
should
publish
some
part
of
the
contents
and
give
our
friend
pain
and
myself
censure
some
time
since
there
fell
into
my
hands
to
my
great
joy
about
sheets
in
thy
own
handwriting
containing
an
account
of
the
parentage
and
life
of
thyself
directed
to
thy
son
ending
in
the
year
with
which
there
were
notes
likewise
in
thy
writing
a
copy
of
which
i
inclose
in
hopes
it
may
be
a
means
if
thou
continued
it
up
to
a
later
period
that
the
first
and
latter
part
may
be
put
together
and
if
it
is
not
yet
continued
i
hope
thee
will
not
delay
it
life
is
uncertain
as
the
preacher
tells
us
and
what
will
the
world
say
if
kind
humane
and
benevolent
ben
franklin
should
leave
his
friends
and
the
world
deprived
of
so
pleasing
and
profitable
a
work
a
work
which
would
be
useful
and
entertaining
not
only
to
a
few
but
to
millions
the
influence
writings
under
that
class
have
on
the
minds
of
youth
is
very
great
and
has
nowhere
appeared
to
me
so
plain
as
in
our
public
friend
journals
it
almost
insensibly
leads
the
youth
into
the
resolution
of
endeavoring
to
become
as
good
and
eminent
as
the
journalist
should
thine
for
instance
when
published
and
i
think
it
could
not
fail
of
it
lead
the
youth
to
equal
the
industry
and
temperance
of
thy
early
youth
what
a
blessing
with
that
class
would
such
a
work
be
i
know
of
no
character
living
nor
many
of
them
put
together
who
has
so
much
in
his
power
as
thyself
to
promote
a
greater
spirit
of
industry
and
early
attention
to
business
frugality
and
temperance
with
the
american
youth
not
that
i
think
the
work
would
have
no
other
merit
and
use
in
the
world
far
from
it
but
the
first
is
of
such
vast
importance
that
i
know
nothing
that
can
equal
it
the
foregoing
letter
and
the
minutes
accompanying
it
being
shown
to
a
friend
i
received
from
him
the
following
letter
from
benjamin
vaughan
paris
january
my
dearest
sir
when
i
had
read
over
your
sheets
of
minutes
of
the
principal
incidents
of
your
life
recovered
for
you
by
your
quaker
acquaintance
i
told
you
i
would
send
you
a
letter
expressing
my
reasons
why
i
thought
it
would
be
useful
to
complete
and
publish
it
as
he
desired
various
concerns
have
for
some
time
past
prevented
this
letter
being
written
and
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
worth
any
expectation
happening
to
be
at
leisure
however
at
present
i
shall
by
writing
at
least
interest
and
instruct
myself
but
as
the
terms
i
am
inclined
to
use
may
tend
to
offend
a
person
of
your
manners
i
shall
only
tell
you
how
i
would
address
any
other
person
who
was
as
good
and
as
great
as
yourself
but
less
diffident
i
would
say
to
him
sir
i
solicit
the
history
of
your
life
from
the
following
motives
your
history
is
so
remarkable
that
if
you
do
not
give
it
somebody
else
will
certainly
give
it
and
perhaps
so
as
nearly
to
do
as
much
harm
as
your
own
management
of
the
thing
might
do
good
it
will
moreover
present
a
table
of
the
internal
circumstances
of
your
country
which
will
very
much
tend
to
invite
to
it
settlers
of
virtuous
and
manly
minds
and
considering
the
eagerness
with
which
such
information
is
sought
by
them
and
the
extent
of
your
reputation
i
do
not
know
of
a
more
efficacious
advertisement
than
your
biography
would
give
all
that
has
happened
to
you
is
also
connected
with
the
detail
of
the
manners
and
situation
of
a
rising
people
and
in
this
respect
i
do
not
think
that
the
writings
of
cæsar
and
tacitus
can
be
more
interesting
to
a
true
judge
of
human
nature
and
society
but
these
sir
are
small
reasons
in
my
opinion
compared
with
the
chance
which
your
life
will
give
for
the
forming
of
future
great
men
and
in
conjunction
with
your
art
of
virtue
which
you
design
to
publish
of
improving
the
features
of
private
character
and
consequently
of
aiding
all
happiness
both
public
and
domestic
the
two
works
i
allude
to
sir
will
in
particular
give
a
noble
rule
and
example
of
school
and
other
education
constantly
proceed
upon
false
principles
and
show
a
clumsy
apparatus
pointed
at
a
false
mark
but
your
apparatus
is
simple
and
the
mark
a
true
one
and
while
parents
and
young
persons
are
left
destitute
of
other
just
means
of
estimating
and
becoming
prepared
for
a
reasonable
course
in
life
your
discovery
that
the
thing
is
in
many
a
man
private
power
will
be
invaluable
influence
upon
the
private
character
late
in
life
is
not
only
an
influence
late
in
life
but
a
weak
influence
it
is
in
youth
that
we
plant
our
chief
habits
and
prejudices
it
is
in
youth
that
we
take
our
party
as
to
profession
pursuits
and
matrimony
in
youth
therefore
the
turn
is
given
in
youth
the
education
even
of
the
next
generation
is
given
in
youth
the
private
and
public
character
is
determined
and
the
term
of
life
extending
but
from
youth
to
age
life
ought
to
begin
well
from
youth
and
more
especially
before
we
take
our
party
as
to
our
principal
objects
but
your
biography
will
not
merely
teach
but
the
education
of
a
wise
man
and
the
wisest
man
will
receive
lights
and
improve
his
progress
by
seeing
detailed
the
conduct
of
another
wise
man
and
why
are
weaker
men
to
be
deprived
of
such
helps
when
we
see
our
race
has
been
blundering
on
in
the
dark
almost
without
a
guide
in
this
particular
from
the
farthest
trace
of
time
show
then
sir
how
much
is
to
be
done
both
to
sons
and
fathers
and
invite
all
wise
men
to
become
like
yourself
and
other
men
to
become
wise
when
we
see
how
cruel
statesmen
and
warriors
can
be
to
the
human
race
and
how
absurd
distinguished
men
can
be
to
their
acquaintance
it
will
be
instructive
to
observe
the
instances
multiply
of
pacific
acquiescing
manners
and
to
find
how
compatible
it
is
to
be
great
and
domestic
enviable
and
yet
the
little
private
incidents
which
you
will
also
have
to
relate
will
have
considerable
use
as
we
want
above
all
things
rules
of
prudence
in
ordinary
affairs
and
it
will
be
curious
to
see
how
you
have
acted
in
these
it
will
be
so
far
a
sort
of
key
to
life
and
explain
many
things
that
all
men
ought
to
have
once
explained
to
them
to
give
them
a
chance
of
becoming
wise
by
foresight
the
nearest
thing
to
having
experience
of
one
own
is
to
have
other
people
affairs
brought
before
us
in
a
shape
that
is
interesting
this
is
sure
to
happen
from
your
pen
our
affairs
and
management
will
have
an
air
of
simplicity
or
importance
that
will
not
fail
to
strike
and
i
am
convinced
you
have
conducted
them
with
as
much
originality
as
if
you
had
been
conducting
discussions
in
politics
or
philosophy
and
what
more
worthy
of
experiments
and
system
its
importance
and
its
errors
considered
than
human
life
some
men
have
been
virtuous
blindly
others
have
speculated
fantastically
and
others
have
been
shrewd
to
bad
purposes
but
you
sir
i
am
sure
will
give
under
your
hand
nothing
but
what
is
at
the
same
moment
wise
practical
and
good
your
account
of
yourself
for
i
suppose
the
parallel
i
am
drawing
for
franklin
will
hold
not
only
in
point
of
character
but
of
private
history
will
show
that
you
are
ashamed
of
no
origin
a
thing
the
more
important
as
you
prove
how
little
necessary
all
origin
is
to
happiness
virtue
or
greatness
as
no
end
likewise
happens
without
a
means
so
we
shall
find
sir
that
even
you
yourself
framed
a
plan
by
which
you
became
considerable
but
at
the
same
time
we
may
see
that
though
the
event
is
flattering
the
means
are
as
simple
as
wisdom
could
make
them
that
is
depending
upon
nature
virtue
thought
and
habit
another
thing
demonstrated
will
be
the
propriety
of
every
man
waiting
for
his
time
for
appearing
upon
the
stage
of
the
world
our
sensations
being
very
much
fixed
to
the
moment
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
more
moments
are
to
follow
the
first
and
consequently
that
man
should
arrange
his
conduct
so
as
to
suit
the
whole
of
a
life
your
attribution
appears
to
have
been
applied
to
your
life
and
the
passing
moments
of
it
have
been
enlivened
with
content
and
enjoyment
instead
of
being
tormented
with
foolish
impatience
or
regrets
such
a
conduct
is
easy
for
those
who
make
virtue
and
themselves
in
countenance
by
examples
of
other
truly
great
men
of
whom
patience
is
so
often
the
characteristic
your
quaker
correspondent
sir
for
here
again
i
will
suppose
the
subject
of
my
letter
resembling
franklin
praised
your
frugality
diligence
and
temperance
which
he
considered
as
a
pattern
for
all
youth
but
it
is
singular
that
he
should
have
forgotten
your
modesty
and
your
disinterestedness
without
which
you
never
could
have
waited
for
your
advancement
or
found
your
situation
in
the
mean
time
comfortable
which
is
a
strong
lesson
to
show
the
poverty
of
glory
and
the
importance
of
regulating
our
minds
if
this
correspondent
had
known
the
nature
of
your
reputation
as
well
as
i
do
he
would
have
said
your
former
writings
and
measures
would
secure
attention
to
your
biography
and
art
of
virtue
and
your
biography
and
art
of
virtue
in
return
would
secure
attention
to
them
this
is
an
advantage
attendant
upon
a
various
character
and
which
brings
all
that
belongs
to
it
into
greater
play
and
it
is
the
more
useful
as
perhaps
more
persons
are
at
a
loss
for
the
means
of
improving
their
minds
and
characters
than
they
are
for
the
time
or
the
inclination
to
do
it
but
there
is
one
concluding
reflection
sir
that
will
shew
the
use
of
your
life
as
a
mere
piece
of
biography
this
style
of
writing
seems
a
little
gone
out
of
vogue
and
yet
it
is
a
very
useful
one
and
your
specimen
of
it
may
be
particularly
serviceable
as
it
will
make
a
subject
of
comparison
with
the
lives
of
various
public
cutthroats
and
intriguers
and
with
absurd
monastic
or
vain
literary
triflers
if
it
encourages
more
writings
of
the
same
kind
with
your
own
and
induces
more
men
to
spend
lives
fit
to
be
written
it
will
be
worth
all
plutarch
lives
put
together
but
being
tired
of
figuring
to
myself
a
character
of
which
every
feature
suits
only
one
man
in
the
world
without
giving
him
the
praise
of
it
i
shall
end
my
letter
my
dear
franklin
with
a
personal
application
to
your
proper
self
i
am
earnestly
desirous
then
my
dear
sir
that
you
should
let
the
world
into
the
traits
of
your
genuine
character
as
civil
broils
may
otherwise
tend
to
disguise
or
traduce
it
considering
your
great
age
the
caution
of
your
character
and
your
peculiar
style
of
thinking
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
besides
yourself
can
be
sufficiently
master
of
the
facts
of
your
life
or
the
intentions
of
your
mind
besides
all
this
the
immense
revolution
of
the
present
period
will
necessarily
turn
our
attention
towards
the
author
of
it
and
when
virtuous
principles
have
been
pretended
in
it
it
will
be
highly
important
to
shew
that
such
have
really
influenced
and
as
your
own
character
will
be
the
principal
one
to
receive
a
scrutiny
it
is
proper
even
for
its
effects
upon
your
vast
and
rising
country
as
well
as
upon
england
and
upon
europe
that
it
should
stand
respectable
and
eternal
for
the
furtherance
of
human
happiness
i
have
always
maintained
that
it
is
necessary
to
prove
that
man
is
not
even
at
present
a
vicious
and
detestable
animal
and
still
more
to
prove
that
good
management
may
greatly
amend
him
and
it
is
for
much
the
same
reason
that
i
am
anxious
to
see
the
opinion
established
that
there
are
fair
characters
existing
among
the
individuals
of
the
race
for
the
moment
that
all
men
without
exception
shall
be
conceived
abandoned
good
people
will
cease
efforts
deemed
to
be
hopeless
and
perhaps
think
of
taking
their
share
in
the
scramble
of
life
or
at
least
of
making
it
comfortable
principally
for
themselves
take
then
my
dear
sir
this
work
most
speedily
into
hand
shew
yourself
good
as
you
are
good
temperate
as
you
are
temperate
and
above
all
things
prove
yourself
as
one
who
from
your
infancy
have
loved
justice
liberty
and
concord
in
a
way
that
has
made
it
natural
and
consistent
for
you
to
have
acted
as
we
have
seen
you
act
in
the
last
seventeen
years
of
your
life
let
englishmen
be
made
not
only
to
respect
but
even
to
love
you
when
they
think
well
of
individuals
in
your
native
country
they
will
go
nearer
to
thinking
well
of
your
country
and
when
your
countrymen
see
themselves
well
thought
of
by
englishmen
they
will
go
nearer
to
thinking
well
of
england
extend
your
views
even
further
do
not
stop
at
those
who
speak
the
english
tongue
but
after
having
settled
so
many
points
in
nature
and
politics
think
of
bettering
the
whole
race
of
men
as
i
have
not
read
any
part
of
the
life
in
question
but
know
only
the
character
that
lived
it
i
write
somewhat
at
hazard
i
am
sure
however
that
the
life
and
the
treatise
i
allude
to
on
the
art
of
virtue
will
necessarily
fulfil
the
chief
of
my
expectations
and
still
more
so
if
you
take
up
the
measure
of
suiting
these
performances
to
the
several
views
above
stated
should
they
even
prove
unsuccessful
in
all
that
a
sanguine
admirer
of
yours
hopes
from
them
you
will
at
least
have
framed
pieces
to
interest
the
human
mind
and
whoever
gives
a
feeling
of
pleasure
that
is
innocent
to
man
has
added
so
much
to
the
fair
side
of
a
life
otherwise
too
much
darkened
by
anxiety
and
too
much
injured
by
pain
in
the
hope
therefore
that
you
will
listen
to
the
prayer
addressed
to
you
in
this
letter
i
beg
to
subscribe
myself
my
dearest
sir
signed
benj
vaughan
continuation
of
the
account
of
my
life
begun
at
passy
near
paris
it
is
some
time
since
i
receiv
the
above
letters
but
i
have
been
too
busy
till
now
to
think
of
complying
with
the
request
they
contain
it
might
too
be
much
better
done
if
i
were
at
home
among
my
papers
which
would
aid
my
memory
and
help
to
ascertain
dates
but
my
return
being
uncertain
and
having
just
now
a
little
leisure
i
will
endeavor
to
recollect
and
write
what
i
can
if
i
live
to
get
home
it
may
there
be
corrected
and
improv
not
having
any
copy
here
of
what
is
already
written
i
know
not
whether
an
account
is
given
of
the
means
i
used
to
establish
the
philadelphia
public
library
which
from
a
small
beginning
is
now
become
so
considerable
though
i
remember
to
have
come
down
to
near
the
time
of
that
transaction
i
will
therefore
begin
here
with
an
account
of
it
which
may
be
struck
out
if
found
to
have
been
already
given
at
the
time
i
establish
myself
in
pennsylvania
there
was
not
a
good
bookseller
shop
in
any
of
the
colonies
to
the
southward
of
boston
in
new
york
and
the
printers
were
indeed
stationers
they
sold
only
paper
almanacs
ballads
and
a
few
common
those
who
lov
reading
were
oblig
to
send
for
their
books
from
england
the
members
of
the
junto
had
each
a
few
we
had
left
the
alehouse
where
we
first
met
and
hired
a
room
to
hold
our
club
in
i
propos
that
we
should
all
of
us
bring
our
books
to
that
room
where
they
would
not
only
be
ready
to
consult
in
our
conferences
but
become
a
common
benefit
each
of
us
being
at
liberty
to
borrow
such
as
he
to
read
at
home
this
was
accordingly
done
and
for
some
time
contented
us
finding
the
advantage
of
this
little
collection
i
propos
to
render
the
benefit
from
books
more
common
by
commencing
a
public
subscription
library
i
drew
a
sketch
of
the
plan
and
rules
that
would
be
necessary
and
got
a
skilful
conveyancer
charles
brockden
to
put
the
whole
in
form
of
articles
of
agreement
to
be
subscribed
by
which
each
subscriber
engag
to
pay
a
certain
sum
down
for
the
first
purchase
of
books
and
an
annual
contribution
for
increasing
them
so
few
were
the
readers
at
that
time
in
philadelphia
and
the
majority
of
us
so
poor
that
i
was
not
able
with
great
industry
to
find
more
than
fifty
persons
mostly
young
tradesmen
willing
to
pay
down
for
this
purpose
forty
shillings
each
and
ten
shillings
per
annum
on
this
little
fund
we
began
the
books
were
imported
the
library
was
opened
one
day
in
the
week
for
lending
to
the
subscribers
on
their
promissory
notes
to
pay
double
the
value
if
not
duly
returned
the
institution
soon
manifested
its
utility
was
imitated
by
other
towns
and
in
other
provinces
the
libraries
were
augmented
by
donations
reading
became
fashionable
and
our
people
having
no
publick
amusements
to
divert
their
attention
from
study
became
better
acquainted
with
books
and
in
a
few
years
were
observ
by
strangers
to
be
better
instructed
and
more
intelligent
than
people
of
the
same
rank
generally
are
in
other
countries
when
we
were
about
to
sign
the
articles
which
were
to
be
binding
upon
us
our
heirs
for
fifty
years
brockden
the
scrivener
said
to
us
you
are
young
men
but
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
any
of
you
will
live
to
see
the
expiration
of
the
term
fix
in
the
instrument
a
number
of
us
however
are
yet
living
but
the
instrument
was
after
a
few
years
rendered
null
by
a
charter
that
incorporated
and
gave
perpetuity
to
the
company
the
objections
and
reluctances
i
met
with
in
soliciting
the
subscriptions
made
me
soon
feel
the
impropriety
of
presenting
self
as
the
proposer
of
any
useful
project
that
might
be
suppos
to
raise
one
reputation
in
the
smallest
degree
above
that
of
neighbors
when
one
has
need
of
their
assistance
to
accomplish
that
project
i
therefore
put
myself
as
much
as
i
could
out
of
sight
and
stated
it
as
a
scheme
of
a
number
of
friends
who
had
requested
me
to
go
about
and
propose
it
to
such
as
they
thought
lovers
of
reading
in
this
way
my
affair
went
on
more
smoothly
and
i
ever
after
practis
it
on
such
occasions
and
from
my
frequent
successes
can
heartily
recommend
it
the
present
little
sacrifice
of
your
vanity
will
afterwards
be
amply
repaid
if
it
remains
a
while
uncertain
to
whom
the
merit
belongs
some
one
more
vain
than
yourself
will
be
encouraged
to
claim
it
and
then
even
envy
will
be
disposed
to
do
you
justice
by
plucking
those
assumed
feathers
and
restoring
them
to
their
right
owner
this
library
afforded
me
the
means
of
improvement
by
constant
study
for
which
i
set
apart
an
hour
or
two
each
day
and
thus
repair
in
some
degree
the
loss
of
the
learned
education
my
father
once
intended
for
me
reading
was
the
only
amusement
i
allow
myself
i
spent
no
time
in
taverns
games
or
frolicks
of
any
kind
and
my
industry
in
my
business
continu
as
indefatigable
as
it
was
necessary
i
was
indebted
for
my
i
had
a
young
family
coming
on
to
be
educated
and
i
had
to
contend
with
for
business
two
printers
who
were
established
in
the
place
before
me
my
circumstances
however
grew
daily
easier
my
original
habits
of
frugality
continuing
and
my
father
having
among
his
instructions
to
me
when
a
boy
frequently
repeated
a
proverb
of
solomon
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
calling
he
shall
stand
before
kings
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
men
i
from
thence
considered
industry
as
a
means
of
obtaining
wealth
and
distinction
which
encourag
me
tho
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
ever
literally
stand
before
kings
which
however
has
since
happened
for
i
have
stood
before
five
and
even
had
the
honor
of
sitting
down
with
one
the
king
of
denmark
to
dinner
we
have
an
english
proverb
that
says
he
that
would
thrive
must
ask
his
wife
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
i
had
one
as
much
dispos
to
industry
and
frugality
as
myself
she
assisted
me
cheerfully
in
my
business
folding
and
stitching
pamphlets
tending
shop
purchasing
old
linen
rags
for
the
papermakers
etc
we
kept
no
idle
servants
our
table
was
plain
and
simple
our
furniture
of
the
cheapest
for
instance
my
breakfast
was
a
long
time
bread
and
milk
no
tea
and
i
ate
it
out
of
a
twopenny
earthen
porringer
with
a
pewter
spoon
but
mark
how
luxury
will
enter
families
and
make
a
progress
in
spite
of
principle
being
call
one
morning
to
breakfast
i
found
it
in
a
china
bowl
with
a
spoon
of
silver
they
had
been
bought
for
me
without
my
knowledge
by
my
wife
and
had
cost
her
the
enormous
sum
of
shillings
for
which
she
had
no
other
excuse
or
apology
to
make
but
that
she
thought
her
husband
deserv
a
silver
spoon
and
china
bowl
as
well
as
any
of
his
neighbors
this
was
the
first
appearance
of
plate
and
china
in
our
house
which
afterward
in
a
course
of
years
as
our
wealth
increas
augmented
gradually
to
several
hundred
pounds
in
value
i
had
been
religiously
educated
as
a
presbyterian
and
tho
some
of
the
dogmas
of
that
persuasion
such
as
the
eternal
decrees
of
god
election
reprobation
appeared
to
me
unintelligible
others
doubtful
and
i
early
absented
myself
from
the
public
assemblies
of
the
sect
sunday
being
my
studying
day
i
never
was
without
some
religious
principles
i
never
doubted
for
instance
the
existence
of
the
deity
that
he
made
the
world
and
govern
it
by
his
providence
that
the
most
acceptable
service
of
god
was
the
doing
good
to
man
that
our
souls
are
immortal
and
that
all
crime
will
be
punished
and
virtue
rewarded
either
here
or
hereafter
these
i
esteem
the
essentials
of
every
religion
and
being
to
be
found
in
all
the
religions
we
had
in
our
country
i
respected
them
all
tho
with
different
degrees
of
respect
as
i
found
them
more
or
less
mix
with
other
articles
which
without
any
tendency
to
inspire
promote
or
confirm
morality
serv
principally
to
divide
us
and
make
us
unfriendly
to
one
another
this
respect
to
all
with
an
opinion
that
the
worst
had
some
good
effects
induc
me
to
avoid
all
discourse
that
might
tend
to
lessen
the
good
opinion
another
might
have
of
his
own
religion
and
as
our
province
increas
in
people
and
new
places
of
worship
were
continually
wanted
and
generally
erected
by
voluntary
contributions
my
mite
for
such
purpose
whatever
might
be
the
sect
was
never
refused
tho
i
seldom
attended
any
public
worship
i
had
still
an
opinion
of
its
propriety
and
of
its
utility
when
rightly
conducted
and
i
regularly
paid
my
annual
subscription
for
the
support
of
the
only
presbyterian
minister
or
meeting
we
had
in
philadelphia
he
us
to
visit
me
sometimes
as
a
friend
and
admonish
me
to
attend
his
administrations
and
i
was
now
and
then
prevail
on
to
do
so
once
for
five
sundays
successively
had
he
been
in
my
opinion
a
good
preacher
perhaps
i
might
have
continued
notwithstanding
the
occasion
i
had
for
the
leisure
in
my
course
of
study
but
his
discourses
were
chiefly
either
polemic
arguments
or
explications
of
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
our
sect
and
were
all
to
me
very
dry
uninteresting
and
unedifying
since
not
a
single
moral
principle
was
inculcated
or
enforc
their
aim
seeming
to
be
rather
to
make
us
presbyterians
than
good
citizens
at
length
he
took
for
his
text
that
verse
of
the
fourth
chapter
of
philippians
finally
brethren
whatsoever
things
are
true
honest
just
pure
lovely
or
of
good
report
if
there
be
any
virtue
or
any
praise
think
on
these
things
and
i
imagin
in
a
sermon
on
such
a
text
we
could
not
miss
of
having
some
morality
but
he
confin
himself
to
five
points
only
as
meant
by
the
apostle
viz
keeping
holy
the
sabbath
day
being
diligent
in
reading
the
holy
scriptures
attending
duly
the
publick
worship
partaking
of
the
sacrament
paying
a
due
respect
to
god
ministers
these
might
be
all
good
things
but
as
they
were
not
the
kind
of
good
things
that
i
expected
from
that
text
i
despaired
of
ever
meeting
with
them
from
any
other
was
disgusted
and
attended
his
preaching
no
more
i
had
some
years
before
compos
a
little
liturgy
or
form
of
prayer
for
my
own
private
use
in
entitled
articles
of
belief
and
acts
of
religion
i
return
to
the
use
of
this
and
went
no
more
to
the
public
assemblies
my
conduct
might
be
blameable
but
i
leave
it
without
attempting
further
to
excuse
it
my
present
purpose
being
to
relate
facts
and
not
to
make
apologies
for
them
it
was
about
this
time
i
conceiv
the
bold
and
arduous
project
of
arriving
at
moral
perfection
i
wish
to
live
without
committing
any
fault
at
any
time
i
would
conquer
all
that
either
natural
inclination
custom
or
company
might
lead
me
into
as
i
knew
or
thought
i
knew
what
was
right
and
wrong
i
did
not
see
why
i
might
not
always
do
the
one
and
avoid
the
other
but
i
soon
found
i
had
undertaken
a
task
of
more
difficulty
than
i
had
imagined
while
my
care
was
employ
in
guarding
against
one
fault
i
was
often
surprised
by
another
habit
took
the
advantage
of
inattention
inclination
was
sometimes
too
strong
for
reason
i
concluded
at
length
that
the
mere
speculative
conviction
that
it
was
our
interest
to
be
completely
virtuous
was
not
sufficient
to
prevent
our
slipping
and
that
the
contrary
habits
must
be
broken
and
good
ones
acquired
and
established
before
we
can
have
any
dependence
on
a
steady
uniform
rectitude
of
conduct
for
this
purpose
i
therefore
contrived
the
following
method
in
the
various
enumerations
of
the
moral
virtues
i
had
met
with
in
my
reading
i
found
the
catalogue
more
or
less
numerous
as
different
writers
included
more
or
fewer
ideas
under
the
same
name
temperance
for
example
was
by
some
confined
to
eating
and
drinking
while
by
others
it
was
extended
to
mean
the
moderating
every
other
pleasure
appetite
inclination
or
passion
bodily
or
mental
even
to
our
avarice
and
ambition
i
propos
to
myself
for
the
sake
of
clearness
to
use
rather
more
names
with
fewer
ideas
annex
to
each
than
a
few
names
with
more
ideas
and
i
included
under
thirteen
names
of
virtues
all
that
at
that
time
occurr
to
me
as
necessary
or
desirable
and
annexed
to
each
a
short
precept
which
fully
express
the
extent
i
gave
to
its
meaning
these
names
of
virtues
with
their
precepts
were
temperance
eat
not
to
dullness
drink
not
to
elevation
silence
speak
not
but
what
may
benefit
others
or
yourself
avoid
trifling
conversation
order
let
all
your
things
have
their
places
let
each
part
of
your
business
have
its
time
resolution
resolve
to
perform
what
you
ought
perform
without
fail
what
you
resolve
frugality
make
no
expense
but
to
do
good
to
others
or
yourself
waste
nothing
industry
lose
no
time
be
always
employ
in
something
useful
cut
off
all
unnecessary
actions
sincerity
use
no
hurtful
deceit
think
innocently
and
justly
and
if
you
speak
speak
accordingly
justice
wrong
none
by
doing
injuries
or
omitting
the
benefits
that
are
your
duty
moderation
avoid
extreams
forbear
resenting
injuries
so
much
as
you
think
they
deserve
cleanliness
tolerate
no
uncleanliness
in
body
cloaths
or
habitation
tranquillity
be
not
disturbed
at
trifles
or
at
accidents
common
or
unavoidable
chastity
rarely
use
venery
but
for
health
or
offspring
never
to
dulness
weakness
or
the
injury
of
your
own
or
another
peace
or
reputation
humility
imitate
jesus
and
socrates
my
intention
being
to
acquire
the
habitude
of
all
these
virtues
i
judg
it
would
be
well
not
to
distract
my
attention
by
attempting
the
whole
at
once
but
to
fix
it
on
one
of
them
at
a
time
and
when
i
should
be
master
of
that
then
to
proceed
to
another
and
so
on
till
i
should
have
gone
thro
the
thirteen
and
as
the
previous
acquisition
of
some
might
facilitate
the
acquisition
of
certain
others
i
arrang
them
with
that
view
as
they
stand
above
temperance
first
as
it
tends
to
procure
that
coolness
and
clearness
of
head
which
is
so
necessary
where
constant
vigilance
was
to
be
kept
up
and
guard
maintained
against
the
unremitting
attraction
of
ancient
habits
and
the
force
of
perpetual
temptations
this
being
acquir
and
establish
silence
would
be
more
easy
and
my
desire
being
to
gain
knowledge
at
the
same
time
that
i
improv
in
virtue
and
considering
that
in
conversation
it
was
rather
by
the
use
of
the
ears
than
of
the
tongue
and
therefore
wishing
to
break
a
habit
i
was
getting
into
of
prattling
punning
and
joking
which
only
made
me
acceptable
to
trifling
company
i
gave
silence
the
second
place
this
and
the
next
order
i
expected
would
allow
me
more
time
for
attending
to
my
project
and
my
studies
resolution
once
become
habitual
would
keep
me
firm
in
my
endeavors
to
obtain
all
the
subsequent
virtues
frugality
and
industry
freeing
me
from
my
remaining
debt
and
producing
affluence
and
independence
would
make
more
easy
the
practice
of
sincerity
and
justice
etc
conceiving
then
that
agreeably
to
the
advice
of
pythagoras
in
his
golden
verses
daily
examination
would
be
necessary
i
contrived
the
following
method
for
conducting
that
examination
i
made
a
little
book
in
which
i
allotted
a
page
for
each
of
the
virtues
i
rul
each
page
with
red
ink
so
as
to
have
seven
columns
one
for
each
day
of
the
week
marking
each
column
with
a
letter
for
the
day
i
cross
these
columns
with
thirteen
red
lines
marking
the
beginning
of
each
line
with
the
first
letter
of
one
of
the
virtues
on
which
line
and
in
its
proper
column
i
might
mark
by
a
little
black
spot
every
fault
i
found
upon
examination
to
have
been
committed
respecting
that
virtue
upon
that
day
form
of
the
pages
temperance
eat
not
to
dulness
drink
not
to
elevation
o
i
i
determined
to
give
a
week
strict
attention
to
each
of
the
virtues
successively
thus
in
the
first
week
my
great
guard
was
to
avoid
every
the
least
offence
against
temperance
leaving
the
other
virtues
to
their
ordinary
chance
only
marking
every
evening
the
faults
of
the
day
thus
if
in
the
first
week
i
could
keep
my
first
line
marked
t
clear
of
spots
i
suppos
the
habit
of
that
virtue
so
much
strengthen
and
its
opposite
weaken
that
i
might
venture
extending
my
attention
to
include
the
next
and
for
the
following
week
keep
both
lines
clear
of
spots
proceeding
thus
to
the
last
i
could
go
thro
a
course
compleat
in
thirteen
weeks
and
four
courses
in
a
year
and
like
him
who
having
a
garden
to
weed
does
not

of

and

it
with
occasional
intermissions
for
some
time
i
was
surpris
to
find
myself
so
much
fuller
of
faults
than
i
had
imagined
but
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
diminish
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
renewing
now
and
then
my
little
book
which
by
scraping
out
the
marks
on
the
paper
of
old
faults
to
make
room
for
new
ones
in
a
new
course
became
full
of
holes
i
transferr
my
tables
and
precepts
to
the
ivory
leaves
of
a
memorandum
book
on
which
the
lines
were
drawn
with
red
ink
that
made
a
durable
stain
and
on
those
lines
i
mark
my
faults
with
a
pencil
which
marks
i
could
easily
wipe
out
with
a
wet
sponge
after
a
while
i
went
thro
one
course
only
in
a
year
and
afterward
only
one
in
several
years
till
at
length
i
omitted
them
entirely
being
employ
in
voyages
and
business
abroad
with
a
multiplicity
of
affairs
that
interfered
but
i
always
carried
my
little
book
with
me
my
scheme
of
order
gave
me
the
most
trouble
and
i
found
that
tho
it
might
be
practicable
where
a
man
business
was
such
as
to
leave
him
the
disposition
of
his
time
that
of
a
journeyman
printer
for
instance
it
was
not
possible
to
be
exactly
observed
by
a
master
who
must
mix
with
the
world
and
often
receive
people
of
business
at
their
own
hours
order
too
with
regard
to
places
for
things
papers
i
found
extreamly
difficult
to
acquire
i
had
not
been
early
accustomed
to
it
and
having
an
exceeding
good
memory
i
was
not
so
sensible
of
the
inconvenience
attending
want
of
method
this
article
therefore
cost
me
so
much
painful
attention
and
my
faults
in
it
vexed
me
so
much
and
i
made
so
little
progress
in
amendment
and
had
such
frequent
relapses
that
i
was
almost
ready
to
give
up
the
attempt
and
content
myself
with
a
faulty
character
in
that
respect
like
the
man
who
in
buying
an
ax
of
a
smith
my
neighbour
desired
to
have
the
whole
of
its
surface
as
bright
as
the
edge
the
smith
consented
to
grind
it
bright
for
him
if
he
would
turn
the
wheel
he
turn
while
the
smith
press
the
broad
face
of
the
ax
hard
and
heavily
on
the
stone
which
made
the
turning
of
it
very
fatiguing
the
man
came
every
now
and
then
from
the
wheel
to
see
how
the
work
went
on
and
at
length
would
take
his
ax
as
it
was
without
farther
grinding
no
said
the
smith
turn
on
turn
on
we
shall
have
it
bright
as
yet
it
is
only
speckled
yes
said
the
man
but
i
think
i
like
a
speckled
ax
best
and
i
believe
this
may
have
been
the
case
with
many
who
having
for
want
of
some
such
means
as
i
employ
found
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
good
and
breaking
bad
habits
in
other
points
of
vice
and
virtue
have
given
up
the
struggle
and
concluded
that
a
speckled
ax
was
best
for
something
that
pretended
to
be
reason
was
every
now
and
then
suggesting
to
me
that
such
extream
nicety
as
i
exacted
of
myself
might
be
a
kind
of
foppery
in
morals
which
if
it
were
known
would
make
me
ridiculous
that
a
perfect
character
might
be
attended
with
the
inconvenience
of
being
envied
and
hated
and
that
a
benevolent
man
should
allow
a
few
faults
in
himself
to
keep
his
friends
in
countenance
in
truth
i
found
myself
incorrigible
with
respect
to
order
and
now
i
am
grown
old
and
my
memory
bad
i
feel
very
sensibly
the
want
of
it
but
on
the
whole
tho
i
never
arrived
at
the
perfection
i
had
been
so
ambitious
of
obtaining
but
fell
far
short
of
it
yet
i
was
by
the
endeavour
a
better
and
a
happier
man
than
i
otherwise
should
have
been
if
i
had
not
attempted
it
as
those
who
aim
at
perfect
writing
by
imitating
the
engraved
copies
tho
they
never
reach
the
excellence
of
those
copies
their
hand
is
mended
by
the
endeavor
and
is
tolerable
while
it
continues
fair
and
legible
it
may
be
well
my
posterity
should
be
informed
that
to
this
little
artifice
with
the
blessing
of
god
their
ancestor
ow
the
constant
felicity
of
his
life
down
to
his
year
in
which
this
is
written
what
reverses
may
attend
the
remainder
is
in
the
hand
of
providence
but
if
they
arrive
the
reflection
on
past
happiness
enjoy
ought
to
help
his
bearing
them
with
more
resignation
to
temperance
he
ascribes
his
health
and
what
is
still
left
to
him
of
a
good
constitution
to
industry
and
frugality
the
early
easiness
of
his
circumstances
and
acquisition
of
his
fortune
with
all
that
knowledge
that
enabled
him
to
be
a
useful
citizen
and
obtained
for
him
some
degree
of
reputation
among
the
learned
to
sincerity
and
justice
the
confidence
of
his
country
and
the
honorable
employs
it
conferred
upon
him
and
to
the
joint
influence
of
the
whole
mass
of
the
virtues
even
in
the
imperfect
state
he
was
able
to
acquire
them
all
that
evenness
of
temper
and
that
cheerfulness
in
conversation
which
makes
his
company
still
sought
for
and
agreeable
even
to
his
younger
acquaintance
i
hope
therefore
that
some
of
my
descendants
may
follow
the
example
and
reap
the
benefit
it
will
be
remark
that
tho
my
scheme
was
not
wholly
without
religion
there
was
in
it
no
mark
of
any
of
the
distinguishing
tenets
of
any
particular
sect
i
had
purposely
avoided
them
for
being
fully
persuaded
of
the
utility
and
excellency
of
my
method
and
that
it
might
be
serviceable
to
people
in
all
religions
and
intending
some
time
or
other
to
publish
it
i
would
not
have
any
thing
in
it
that
should
prejudice
any
one
of
any
sect
against
it
i
purposed
writing
a
little
comment
on
each
virtue
in
which
i
would
have
shown
the
advantages
of
possessing
it
and
the
mischiefs
attending
its
opposite
vice
and
i
should
have
called
my
book
the
art
of
virtue
because
it
would
have
shown
the
means
and
manner
of
obtaining
virtue
which
would
have
distinguished
it
from
the
mere
exhortation
to
be
good
that
does
not
instruct
and
indicate
the
means
but
is
like
the
apostle
man
of
verbal
charity
who
only
without
showing
to
the
naked
and
hungry
how
or
where
they
might
get
clothes
or
victuals
exhorted
them
to
be
fed
and
james
ii
nothing
so
likely
to
make
a
man
fortune
as
marg
note
but
it
so
happened
that
my
intention
of
writing
and
publishing
this
comment
was
never
fulfilled
i
did
indeed
from
time
to
time
put
down
short
hints
of
the
sentiments
reasonings
to
be
made
use
of
in
it
some
of
which
i
have
still
by
me
but
the
necessary
close
attention
to
private
business
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
life
and
public
business
since
have
occasioned
my
postponing
it
for
it
being
connected
in
my
mind
with
a
great
and
extensive
project
that
required
the
whole
man
to
execute
and
which
an
unforeseen
succession
of
employs
prevented
my
attending
to
it
has
hitherto
remain
unfinish
in
this
piece
it
was
my
design
to
explain
and
enforce
this
doctrine
that
vicious
actions
are
not
hurtful
because
they
are
forbidden
but
forbidden
because
they
are
hurtful
the
nature
of
man
alone
considered
that
it
was
therefore
every
one
interest
to
be
virtuous
who
to
be
happy
even
in
this
world
and
i
should
from
this
circumstance
there
being
always
in
the
world
a
number
of
rich
merchants
nobility
states
and
princes
who
have
need
of
honest
instruments
for
the
management
of
their
affairs
and
such
being
so
rare
have
endeavored
to
convince
young
persons
that
no
qualities
were
so
likely
to
make
a
poor
man
fortune
as
those
of
probity
and
integrity
my
list
of
virtues
contain
at
first
but
twelve
but
a
quaker
friend
having
kindly
informed
me
that
i
was
generally
thought
proud
that
my
pride
show
itself
frequently
in
conversation
that
i
was
not
content
with
being
in
the
right
when
discussing
any
point
but
was
overbearing
and
rather
insolent
of
which
he
convinc
me
by
mentioning
several
instances
i
determined
endeavouring
to
cure
myself
if
i
could
of
this
vice
or
folly
among
the
rest
and
i
added
humility
to
my
list
giving
an
extensive
meaning
to
the
word
i
can
not
boast
of
much
success
in
acquiring
the
reality
of
this
virtue
but
i
had
a
good
deal
with
regard
to
the
appearance
of
it
i
made
it
a
rule
to
forbear
all
direct
contradiction
to
the
sentiments
of
others
and
all
positive
assertion
of
my
own
i
even
forbid
myself
agreeably
to
the
old
laws
of
our
junto
the
use
of
every
word
or
expression
in
the
language
that
imported
a
fix
opinion
such
as
certainly
undoubtedly
and
i
adopted
instead
of
them
i
conceive
i
apprehend
or
i
imagine
a
thing
to
be
so
or
so
or
it
so
appears
to
me
at
present
when
another
asserted
something
that
i
thought
an
error
i
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
contradicting
him
abruptly
and
of
showing
immediately
some
absurdity
in
his
proposition
and
in
answering
i
began
by
observing
that
in
certain
cases
or
circumstances
his
opinion
would
be
right
but
in
the
present
case
there
appear
or
seem
to
me
some
difference
etc
i
soon
found
the
advantage
of
this
change
in
my
manner
the
conversations
i
engag
in
went
on
more
pleasantly
the
modest
way
in
which
i
my
opinions
procur
them
a
readier
reception
and
less
contradiction
i
had
less
mortification
when
i
was
found
to
be
in
the
wrong
and
i
more
easily
prevail
with
others
to
give
up
their
mistakes
and
join
with
me
when
i
happened
to
be
in
the
right
and
this
mode
which
i
at
first
put
on
with
some
violence
to
natural
inclination
became
at
length
so
easy
and
so
habitual
to
me
that
perhaps
for
these
fifty
years
past
no
one
has
ever
heard
a
dogmatical
expression
escape
me
and
to
this
habit
after
my
character
of
integrity
i
think
it
principally
owing
that
i
had
early
so
much
weight
with
my
when
i
proposed
new
institutions
or
alterations
in
the
old
and
so
much
influence
in
public
councils
when
i
became
a
member
for
i
was
but
a
bad
speaker
never
eloquent
subject
to
much
hesitation
in
my
choice
of
words
hardly
correct
in
language
and
yet
i
generally
carried
my
points
in
reality
there
is
perhaps
no
one
of
our
natural
passions
so
hard
to
subdue
as
pride
disguise
it
struggle
with
it
beat
it
down
stifle
it
mortify
it
as
much
as
one
pleases
it
is
still
alive
and
will
every
now
and
then
peep
out
and
show
itself
you
will
see
it
perhaps
often
in
this
history
for
even
if
i
could
conceive
that
i
had
compleatly
overcome
it
i
should
probably
be
proud
of
my
humility
thus
far
written
at
passy
i
am
now
about
to
write
at
home
august
but
can
not
have
the
help
expected
from
my
papers
many
of
them
being
lost
in
the
war
i
have
however
found
the
following
having
mentioned
a
great
and
extensive
project
which
i
had
conceiv
it
seems
proper
that
some
account
should
be
here
given
of
that
project
and
its
object
its
first
rise
in
my
mind
appears
in
the
following
little
paper
accidentally
preserv
viz
this
is
a
marginal
b
observations
on
my
reading
history
in
library
may
that
the
great
affairs
of
the
world
the
wars
revolutions
are
carried
on
and
affected
by
parties
that
the
view
of
these
parties
is
their
present
general
interest
or
what
they
take
to
be
such
that
the
different
views
of
these
different
parties
occasion
all
confusion
that
while
a
party
is
carrying
on
a
general
design
each
man
has
his
particular
private
interest
in
view
that
as
soon
as
a
party
has
gain
its
general
point
each
member
becomes
intent
upon
his
particular
interest
which
thwarting
others
breaks
that
party
into
divisions
and
occasions
more
confusion
that
few
in
public
affairs
act
from
a
meer
view
of
the
good
of
their
country
whatever
they
may
pretend
and
tho
their
actings
bring
real
good
to
their
country
yet
men
primarily
considered
that
their
own
and
their
country
interest
was
united
and
did
not
act
from
a
principle
of
benevolence
that
fewer
still
in
public
affairs
act
with
a
view
to
the
good
of
mankind
there
seems
to
me
at
present
to
be
great
occasion
for
raising
a
united
party
for
virtue
by
forming
the
virtuous
and
good
men
of
all
nations
into
a
regular
body
to
be
govern
by
suitable
good
and
wise
rules
which
good
and
wise
men
may
probably
be
more
unanimous
in
their
obedience
to
than
common
people
are
to
common
laws
i
at
present
think
that
whoever
attempts
this
aright
and
is
well
qualified
can
not
fail
of
pleasing
god
and
of
meeting
with
success
revolving
this
project
in
my
mind
as
to
be
undertaken
hereafter
when
my
circumstances
should
afford
me
the
necessary
leisure
i
put
down
from
time
to
time
on
pieces
of
paper
such
thoughts
as
occurr
to
me
respecting
it
most
of
these
are
lost
but
i
find
one
purporting
to
be
the
substance
of
an
intended
creed
containing
as
i
thought
the
essentials
of
every
known
religion
and
being
free
of
every
thing
that
might
shock
the
professors
of
any
religion
it
is
express
in
these
words
viz
that
there
is
one
god
who
made
all
things
that
he
governs
the
world
by
his
providence
that
he
ought
to
be
worshiped
by
adoration
prayer
and
thanksgiving
but
that
the
most
acceptable
service
of
god
is
doing
good
to
man
that
the
soul
is
immortal
and
that
god
will
certainly
reward
virtue
and
punish
vice
either
here
or
hereafter
in
the
middle
ages
franklin
if
such
a
phenomenon
as
franklin
were
possible
in
the
middle
ages
would
probably
have
been
the
founder
of
a
monastic
b
my
ideas
at
that
time
were
that
the
sect
should
be
begun
and
spread
at
first
among
young
and
single
men
only
that
each
person
to
be
initiated
should
not
only
declare
his
assent
to
such
creed
but
should
have
exercised
himself
with
the
thirteen
weeks
examination
and
practice
of
the
virtues
as
in
the
model
that
the
existence
of
such
a
society
should
be
kept
a
secret
till
it
was
become
considerable
to
prevent
solicitations
for
the
admission
of
improper
persons
but
that
the
members
should
each
of
them
search
among
his
acquaintance
for
ingenuous
youths
to
whom
with
prudent
caution
the
scheme
should
be
gradually
communicated
that
the
members
should
engage
to
afford
their
advice
assistance
and
support
to
each
other
in
promoting
one
another
interests
business
and
advancement
in
life
that
for
distinction
we
should
be
call
the
society
of
the
free
and
easy
free
as
being
by
the
general
practice
and
habit
of
the
virtues
free
from
the
dominion
of
vice
and
particularly
by
the
practice
of
industry
and
frugality
free
from
debt
which
exposes
a
man
to
confinement
and
a
species
of
slavery
to
his
creditors
this
is
as
much
as
i
can
now
recollect
of
the
project
except
that
i
communicated
it
in
part
to
two
young
men
who
adopted
it
with
some
enthusiasm
but
my
then
narrow
circumstances
and
the
necessity
i
was
under
of
sticking
close
to
my
business
occasion
my
postponing
the
further
prosecution
of
it
at
that
time
and
my
multifarious
occupations
public
and
private
induc
me
to
continue
postponing
so
that
it
has
been
omitted
till
i
have
no
longer
strength
or
activity
left
sufficient
for
such
an
enterprise
tho
i
am
still
of
opinion
that
it
was
a
practicable
scheme
and
might
have
been
very
useful
by
forming
a
great
number
of
good
citizens
and
i
was
not
discourag
by
the
seeming
magnitude
of
the
undertaking
as
i
have
always
thought
that
one
man
of
tolerable
abilities
may
work
great
changes
and
accomplish
great
affairs
among
mankind
if
he
first
forms
a
good
plan
and
cutting
off
all
amusements
or
other
employments
that
would
divert
his
attention
makes
the
execution
of
that
same
plan
his
sole
study
and
business
in
i
first
publish
my
almanack
under
the
name
of
richard
saunders
it
was
continu
by
me
about
years
commonly
call
poor
richard
almanac
i
endeavor
to
make
it
both
entertaining
and
useful
and
it
accordingly
came
to
be
in
such
demand
that
i
considerable
profit
from
it
vending
annually
near
ten
thousand
and
observing
that
it
was
generally
read
scarce
any
neighborhood
in
the
province
being
without
it
i
consider
it
as
a
proper
vehicle
for
conveying
instruction
among
the
common
people
who
bought
scarcely
any
other
books
i
therefore
filled
all
the
little
spaces
that
between
the
remarkable
days
in
the
calendar
with
proverbial
sentences
chiefly
such
as
inculcated
industry
and
frugality
as
the
means
of
procuring
wealth
and
thereby
securing
virtue
it
being
more
difficult
for
a
man
in
want
to
act
always
honestly
as
to
use
here
one
of
those
proverbs
it
is
hard
for
an
empty
sack
to
stand
upright
these
proverbs
which
contained
the
wisdom
of
many
ages
and
nations
i
assembled
and
form
into
a
connected
discourse
prefix
to
the
almanack
of
as
the
harangue
of
a
wise
old
man
to
the
people
attending
an
auction
the
bringing
all
these
scatter
counsels
thus
into
a
focus
enabled
them
to
make
greater
impression
the
piece
being
universally
approved
was
copied
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
continent
reprinted
in
britain
on
a
broad
side
to
be
stuck
up
in
houses
two
translations
were
made
of
it
in
french
and
great
numbers
bought
by
the
clergy
and
gentry
to
distribute
gratis
among
their
poor
parishioners
and
tenants
in
pennsylvania
as
it
discouraged
useless
expense
in
foreign
superfluities
some
thought
it
had
its
share
of
influence
in
producing
that
growing
plenty
of
money
which
was
observable
for
several
years
after
its
publication
i
considered
my
newspaper
also
as
another
means
of
communicating
instruction
and
in
that
view
frequently
reprinted
in
it
extracts
from
the
spectator
and
other
moral
writers
and
sometimes
publish
little
pieces
of
my
own
which
had
been
first
compos
for
reading
in
our
junto
of
these
are
a
socratic
dialogue
tending
to
prove
that
whatever
might
be
his
parts
and
abilities
a
vicious
man
could
not
properly
be
called
a
man
of
sense
and
a
discourse
on
showing
that
virtue
was
not
secure
till
its
practice
became
a
habitude
and
was
free
from
the
opposition
of
contrary
inclinations
these
may
be
found
in
the
papers
about
the
beginning
of
in
the
conduct
of
my
newspaper
i
carefully
excluded
all
libelling
and
personal
abuse
which
is
of
late
years
become
so
disgraceful
to
our
country
whenever
i
was
solicited
to
insert
anything
of
that
kind
and
the
writers
pleaded
as
they
generally
did
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
that
a
newspaper
was
like
a
in
which
any
one
who
would
pay
had
a
right
to
a
place
my
answer
was
that
i
would
print
the
piece
separately
if
desired
and
the
author
might
have
as
many
copies
as
he
pleased
to
distribute
himself
but
that
i
would
not
take
upon
me
to
spread
his
detraction
and
that
having
contracted
with
my
subscribers
to
furnish
them
with
what
might
be
either
useful
or
entertaining
i
could
not
fill
their
papers
with
private
altercation
in
which
they
had
no
concern
without
doing
them
manifest
injustice
now
many
of
our
printers
make
no
scruple
of
gratifying
the
malice
of
individuals
by
false
accusations
of
the
fairest
characters
among
ourselves
augmenting
animosity
even
to
the
producing
of
duels
and
are
moreover
so
indiscreet
as
to
print
scurrilous
reflections
on
the
government
of
neighboring
states
and
even
on
the
conduct
of
our
best
national
allies
which
may
be
attended
with
the
most
pernicious
consequences
these
things
i
mention
as
a
caution
to
young
printers
and
that
they
may
be
encouraged
not
to
pollute
their
presses
and
disgrace
their
profession
by
such
infamous
practices
but
refuse
steadily
as
they
may
see
by
my
example
that
such
a
course
of
conduct
will
not
on
the
whole
be
injurious
to
their
interests
in
i
sent
one
of
my
journeymen
to
charleston
south
carolina
where
a
printer
was
wanting
i
furnish
him
with
a
press
and
letters
on
an
agreement
of
partnership
by
which
i
was
to
receive
of
the
profits
of
the
business
paying
of
the
expense
he
was
a
man
of
learning
and
honest
but
ignorant
in
matters
of
account
and
tho
he
sometimes
made
me
remittances
i
could
get
no
account
from
him
nor
any
satisfactory
state
of
our
partnership
while
he
lived
on
his
decease
the
business
was
continued
by
his
widow
who
being
born
and
bred
in
holland
where
as
i
have
been
inform
the
knowledge
of
accounts
makes
a
part
of
female
education
she
not
only
sent
me
as
clear
a
state
as
she
could
find
of
the
transactions
past
but
continued
to
account
with
the
greatest
regularity
and
exactness
every
quarter
afterwards
and
managed
the
business
with
such
success
that
she
not
only
brought
up
reputably
a
family
of
children
but
at
the
expiration
of
the
term
was
able
to
purchase
of
me
the
and
establish
her
son
in
it
i
mention
this
affair
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
recommending
that
branch
of
education
for
our
young
females
as
likely
to
be
of
more
use
to
them
and
their
children
in
case
of
widowhood
than
either
music
or
dancing
by
preserving
them
from
losses
by
imposition
of
crafty
men
and
enabling
them
to
continue
perhaps
a
profitable
mercantile
house
with
establish
correspondence
till
a
son
is
grown
up
fit
to
undertake
and
go
on
with
it
to
the
lasting
advantage
and
enriching
of
the
family
about
the
year
there
arrived
among
us
from
ireland
a
young
presbyterian
preacher
named
hemphill
who
delivered
with
a
good
voice
and
apparently
extempore
most
excellent
discourses
which
drew
together
considerable
numbers
of
different
persuasion
who
join
in
admiring
them
among
the
rest
i
became
one
of
his
constant
hearers
his
sermons
pleasing
me
as
they
had
little
of
the
dogmatical
kind
but
inculcated
strongly
the
practice
of
virtue
or
what
in
the
religious
stile
are
called
good
works
those
however
of
our
congregation
who
considered
themselves
as
orthodox
presbyterians
disapprov
his
doctrine
and
were
join
by
most
of
the
old
clergy
who
arraign
him
of
heterodoxy
before
the
synod
in
order
to
have
him
silenc
i
became
his
zealous
partisan
and
contributed
all
i
could
to
raise
a
party
in
his
favour
and
we
combated
for
him
a
while
with
some
hopes
of
success
there
was
much
scribbling
pro
and
con
upon
the
occasion
and
finding
that
tho
an
elegant
preacher
he
was
but
a
poor
writer
i
lent
him
my
pen
and
wrote
for
him
two
or
three
pamphlets
and
one
piece
in
the
gazette
of
april
those
pamphlets
as
is
generally
the
case
with
controversial
writings
tho
eagerly
read
at
the
time
were
soon
out
of
vogue
and
i
question
whether
a
single
copy
of
them
now
exists
during
the
contest
an
unlucky
occurrence
hurt
his
cause
exceedingly
one
of
our
adversaries
having
heard
him
preach
a
sermon
that
was
much
admired
thought
he
had
somewhere
read
the
sermon
before
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
on
search
he
found
that
part
quoted
at
length
in
one
of
the
british
reviews
from
a
discourse
of
foster
this
detection
gave
many
of
our
party
disgust
who
accordingly
abandoned
his
cause
and
occasion
our
more
speedy
discomfiture
in
the
synod
i
stuck
by
him
however
as
i
rather
approv
his
giving
us
good
sermons
compos
by
others
than
bad
ones
of
his
own
manufacture
tho
the
latter
was
the
practice
of
our
common
teachers
he
afterward
acknowledg
to
me
that
none
of
those
he
preach
were
his
own
adding
that
his
memory
was
such
as
enabled
him
to
retain
and
repeat
any
sermon
after
one
reading
only
on
our
defeat
he
left
us
in
search
elsewhere
of
better
fortune
and
i
quitted
the
congregation
never
joining
it
after
tho
i
continu
many
years
my
subscription
for
the
support
of
its
ministers
i
had
begun
in
to
study
languages
i
soon
made
myself
so
much
a
master
of
the
french
as
to
be
able
to
read
the
books
with
ease
i
then
undertook
the
italian
an
acquaintance
who
was
also
learning
it
often
to
tempt
me
to
play
chess
with
him
finding
this
took
up
too
much
of
the
time
i
had
to
spare
for
study
i
at
length
refus
to
play
any
more
unless
on
this
condition
that
the
victor
in
every
game
should
have
a
right
to
impose
a
task
either
in
parts
of
the
grammar
to
be
got
by
heart
or
in
translations
which
tasks
the
vanquish
was
to
perform
upon
honour
before
our
next
meeting
as
we
play
pretty
equally
we
thus
beat
one
another
into
that
language
i
afterwards
with
a
little
painstaking
acquir
as
much
of
the
spanish
as
to
read
their
books
also
i
have
already
mention
that
i
had
only
one
year
instruction
in
a
latin
school
and
that
when
very
young
after
which
i
neglected
that
language
entirely
but
when
i
had
attained
an
acquaintance
with
the
french
italian
and
spanish
i
was
surpriz
to
find
on
looking
over
a
latin
testament
that
i
understood
so
much
more
of
that
language
than
i
had
imagined
which
encouraged
me
to
apply
myself
again
to
the
study
of
it
and
i
met
with
more
success
as
those
preceding
languages
had
greatly
smooth
my
way
from
these
circumstances
i
have
thought
that
there
is
some
inconsistency
in
our
common
mode
of
teaching
languages
we
are
told
that
it
is
proper
to
begin
first
with
the
latin
and
having
acquir
that
it
will
be
more
easy
to
attain
those
modern
languages
which
are
from
it
and
yet
we
do
not
begin
with
the
greek
in
order
more
easily
to
acquire
the
latin
it
is
true
that
if
you
can
clamber
and
get
to
the
top
of
a
staircase
without
using
the
steps
you
will
more
easily
gain
them
in
descending
but
certainly
if
you
begin
with
the
lowest
you
will
with
more
ease
ascend
to
the
top
and
i
would
therefore
offer
it
to
the
consideration
of
those
who
superintend
the
education
of
our
youth
whether
since
many
of
those
who
begin
with
the
latin
quit
the
same
after
spending
some
years
without
having
made
any
great
proficiency
and
what
they
have
learnt
becomes
almost
useless
so
that
their
time
has
been
lost
it
would
not
have
been
better
to
have
begun
with
the
french
proceeding
to
the
italian
etc
for
tho
after
spending
the
same
time
they
should
quit
the
study
of
languages
and
never
arrive
at
the
latin
they
would
however
have
acquired
another
tongue
or
two
that
being
in
modern
use
might
be
serviceable
to
them
in
common
life
after
ten
years
absence
from
boston
and
having
become
easy
in
my
circumstances
i
made
a
journey
thither
to
visit
my
relations
which
i
could
not
sooner
well
afford
in
returning
i
call
at
newport
to
see
my
brother
then
settled
there
with
his
our
former
differences
were
forgotten
and
our
meeting
was
very
cordial
and
affectionate
he
was
fast
declining
in
his
health
and
requested
of
me
that
in
case
of
his
death
which
he
apprehended
not
far
distant
i
would
take
home
his
son
then
but
ten
years
of
age
and
bring
him
up
to
the
printing
business
this
i
accordingly
perform
sending
him
a
few
years
to
school
before
i
took
him
into
the
office
his
mother
carried
on
the
business
till
he
was
grown
up
when
i
assisted
him
with
an
assortment
of
new
types
those
of
his
father
being
in
a
manner
worn
out
thus
it
was
that
i
made
my
brother
ample
amends
for
the
service
i
had
depriv
him
of
by
leaving
him
so
early
in
i
lost
one
of
my
sons
a
fine
boy
of
four
years
old
by
the
taken
in
the
common
way
i
long
regretted
bitterly
and
still
regret
that
i
had
not
given
it
to
him
by
inoculation
this
i
mention
for
the
sake
of
parents
who
omit
that
operation
on
the
supposition
that
they
should
never
forgive
themselves
if
a
child
died
under
it
my
example
showing
that
the
regret
may
be
the
same
either
way
and
that
therefore
the
safer
should
be
chosen
our
club
the
junto
was
found
so
useful
and
afforded
such
satisfaction
to
the
members
that
several
were
desirous
of
introducing
their
friends
which
could
not
well
be
done
without
exceeding
what
we
had
settled
as
a
convenient
number
twelve
we
had
from
the
beginning
made
it
a
rule
to
keep
our
institution
a
secret
which
was
pretty
well
observ
the
intention
was
to
avoid
applications
of
improper
persons
for
admittance
some
of
whom
perhaps
we
might
find
it
difficult
to
refuse
i
was
one
of
those
who
were
against
any
addition
to
our
number
but
instead
of
it
made
in
writing
a
proposal
that
every
member
separately
should
endeavor
to
form
a
subordinate
club
with
the
same
rules
respecting
queries
and
without
informing
them
of
the
connection
with
the
junto
the
advantages
proposed
were
the
improvement
of
so
many
more
young
citizens
by
the
use
of
our
institutions
our
better
acquaintance
with
the
general
sentiments
of
the
inhabitants
on
any
occasion
as
the
junto
member
might
propose
what
queries
we
should
desire
and
was
to
report
to
the
junto
what
pass
in
his
separate
club
the
promotion
of
our
particular
interests
in
business
by
more
extensive
recommendation
and
the
increase
of
our
influence
in
public
affairs
and
our
power
of
doing
good
by
spreading
thro
the
several
clubs
the
sentiments
of
the
junto
the
project
was
approv
and
every
member
undertook
to
form
his
club
but
they
did
not
all
succeed
five
or
six
only
were
compleated
which
were
called
by
different
names
as
the
vine
the
union
the
band
etc
they
were
useful
to
themselves
and
afforded
us
a
good
deal
of
amusement
information
and
instruction
besides
answering
in
some
considerable
degree
our
views
of
influencing
the
public
opinion
on
particular
occasions
of
which
i
shall
give
some
instances
in
course
of
time
as
they
happened
my
first
promotion
was
my
being
chosen
in
clerk
of
the
general
assembly
the
choice
was
made
that
year
without
opposition
but
the
year
following
when
i
was
again
propos
the
choice
like
that
of
the
members
being
annual
a
new
member
made
a
long
speech
against
me
in
order
to
favour
some
other
candidate
i
was
however
chosen
which
was
the
more
agreeable
to
me
as
besides
the
pay
for
the
immediate
service
as
clerk
the
place
gave
me
a
better
opportunity
of
keeping
up
an
interest
among
the
members
which
secur
to
me
the
business
of
printing
the
votes
laws
paper
money
and
other
occasional
jobbs
for
the
public
that
on
the
whole
were
very
profitable
i
therefore
did
not
like
the
opposition
of
this
new
member
who
was
a
gentleman
of
fortune
and
education
with
talents
that
were
likely
to
give
him
in
time
great
influence
in
the
house
which
indeed
afterwards
happened
i
did
not
however
aim
at
gaining
his
favour
by
paying
any
servile
respect
to
him
but
after
some
time
took
this
other
method
having
heard
that
he
had
in
his
library
a
certain
very
scarce
and
curious
book
i
wrote
a
note
to
him
expressing
my
desire
of
perusing
that
book
and
requesting
he
would
do
me
the
favour
of
lending
it
to
me
for
a
few
days
he
sent
it
immediately
and
i
return
it
in
about
a
week
with
another
note
expressing
strongly
my
sense
of
the
favour
when
we
next
met
in
the
house
he
spoke
to
me
which
he
had
never
done
before
and
with
great
civility
and
he
ever
after
manifested
a
readiness
to
serve
me
on
all
occasions
so
that
we
became
great
friends
and
our
friendship
continued
to
his
death
this
is
another
instance
of
the
truth
of
an
old
maxim
i
had
learned
which
says
he
that
has
once
done
you
a
kindness
will
be
more
ready
to
do
you
another
than
he
whom
you
yourself
have
obliged
and
it
shows
how
much
more
profitable
it
is
prudently
to
remove
than
to
resent
return
and
continue
inimical
proceedings
in
colonel
spotswood
late
governor
of
virginia
and
then
being
dissatisfied
with
the
conduct
of
his
deputy
at
philadelphia
respecting
some
negligence
in
rendering
and
inexactitude
of
his
accounts
took
from
him
the
commission
and
offered
it
to
me
i
accepted
it
readily
and
found
it
of
great
advantage
for
tho
the
salary
was
small
it
facilitated
the
correspondence
that
improv
my
newspaper
increas
the
number
demanded
as
well
as
the
advertisements
to
be
inserted
so
that
it
came
to
afford
me
a
considerable
income
my
old
competitor
newspaper
declin
proportionably
and
i
was
without
retaliating
his
refusal
while
postmaster
to
permit
my
papers
being
carried
by
the
riders
thus
he
suffer
greatly
from
his
neglect
in
due
accounting
and
i
mention
it
as
a
lesson
to
those
young
men
who
may
be
employ
in
managing
affairs
for
others
that
they
should
always
render
accounts
and
make
remittances
with
great
clearness
and
punctuality
the
character
of
observing
such
a
conduct
is
the
most
powerful
of
all
recommendations
to
new
employments
and
increase
of
business
i
began
now
to
turn
my
thoughts
a
little
to
public
affairs
beginning
however
with
small
matters
the
city
watch
was
one
of
the
first
things
that
i
conceiv
to
want
regulation
it
was
managed
by
the
constables
of
the
respective
wards
in
turn
the
constable
warned
a
number
of
housekeepers
to
attend
him
for
the
night
those
who
chose
never
to
attend
paid
him
six
shillings
a
year
to
be
excus
which
was
to
be
for
hiring
substitutes
but
was
in
reality
much
more
than
was
necessary
for
that
purpose
and
made
the
constableship
a
place
of
profit
and
the
constable
for
a
little
drink
often
got
such
ragamuffins
about
him
as
a
watch
that
respectable
housekeepers
did
not
choose
to
mix
with
walking
the
rounds
too
was
often
neglected
and
most
of
the
nights
spent
in
tippling
i
thereupon
wrote
a
paper
to
be
read
in
junto
representing
these
irregularities
but
insisting
more
particularly
on
the
inequality
of
this
tax
of
the
constables
respecting
the
circumstances
of
those
who
paid
it
since
a
poor
widow
housekeeper
all
whose
property
to
be
guarded
by
the
watch
did
not
perhaps
exceed
the
value
of
fifty
pounds
paid
as
much
as
the
wealthiest
merchant
who
had
thousands
of
pounds
worth
of
goods
in
his
stores
on
the
whole
i
proposed
as
a
more
effectual
watch
the
hiring
of
proper
men
to
serve
constantly
in
that
business
and
as
a
more
equitable
way
of
supporting
the
charge
the
levying
a
tax
that
should
be
proportion
to
the
property
this
idea
being
approv
by
the
junto
was
communicated
to
the
other
clubs
but
as
arising
in
each
of
them
and
though
the
plan
was
not
immediately
carried
into
execution
yet
by
preparing
the
minds
of
people
for
the
change
it
paved
the
way
for
the
law
obtained
a
few
years
after
when
the
members
of
our
clubs
were
grown
into
more
influence
about
this
time
i
wrote
a
paper
first
to
be
read
in
junto
but
it
was
afterward
publish
on
the
different
accidents
and
carelessnesses
by
which
houses
were
set
on
fire
with
cautions
against
them
and
means
proposed
of
avoiding
them
this
was
much
spoken
of
as
a
useful
piece
and
gave
rise
to
a
project
which
soon
followed
it
of
forming
a
company
for
the
more
ready
extinguishing
of
fires
and
mutual
assistance
in
removing
and
securing
the
goods
when
in
danger
associates
in
this
scheme
were
presently
found
amounting
to
thirty
our
articles
of
agreement
oblig
every
member
to
keep
always
in
good
order
and
fit
for
use
a
certain
number
of
leather
buckets
with
strong
bags
and
baskets
for
packing
and
transporting
of
goods
which
were
to
be
brought
to
every
fire
and
we
agreed
to
meet
once
a
month
and
spend
a
social
evening
together
in
discoursing
and
communicating
such
ideas
as
occurred
to
us
upon
the
subject
of
fires
as
might
be
useful
in
our
conduct
on
such
occasions
the
utility
of
this
institution
soon
appeared
and
many
more
desiring
to
be
admitted
than
we
thought
convenient
for
one
company
they
were
advised
to
form
another
which
was
accordingly
done
and
this
went
on
one
new
company
being
formed
after
another
till
they
became
so
numerous
as
to
include
most
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
men
of
property
and
now
at
the
time
of
my
writing
this
tho
upward
of
fifty
years
since
its
establishment
that
which
i
first
formed
called
the
union
fire
company
still
subsists
and
flourishes
tho
the
first
members
are
all
but
myself
and
one
who
is
older
by
a
year
than
i
am
the
small
fines
that
have
been
paid
by
members
for
absence
at
the
monthly
meetings
have
been
apply
to
the
purchase
of
ladders
and
other
useful
implements
for
each
company
so
that
i
question
whether
there
is
a
city
in
the
world
better
provided
with
the
means
of
putting
a
stop
to
beginning
conflagrations
and
in
fact
since
these
institutions
the
city
has
never
lost
by
fire
more
than
one
or
two
houses
at
a
time
and
the
flames
have
often
been
extinguished
before
the
house
in
which
they
began
has
been
half
consumed
in
arrived
among
us
from
ireland
the
reverend
whitefield
who
had
made
himself
remarkable
there
as
an
itinerant
preacher
he
was
at
first
permitted
to
preach
in
some
of
our
churches
but
the
clergy
taking
a
dislike
to
him
soon
refus
him
their
pulpits
and
he
was
oblig
to
preach
in
the
fields
the
multitudes
of
all
sects
and
denominations
that
attended
his
sermons
were
enormous
and
it
was
matter
of
speculation
to
me
who
was
one
of
the
number
to
observe
the
extraordinary
influence
of
his
oratory
on
his
hearers
and
how
much
they
admir
and
respected
him
notwithstanding
his
common
abuse
of
them
by
assuring
them
that
they
were
naturally
half
beasts
and
half
devils
it
was
wonderful
to
see
the
change
soon
made
in
the
manners
of
our
inhabitants
from
being
thoughtless
or
indifferent
about
religion
it
seem
as
if
all
the
world
were
growing
religious
so
that
one
could
not
walk
thro
the
town
in
an
evening
without
hearing
psalms
sung
in
different
families
of
every
street
and
it
being
found
inconvenient
to
assemble
in
the
open
air
subject
to
its
inclemencies
the
building
of
a
house
to
meet
in
was
no
sooner
propos
and
persons
appointed
to
receive
contributions
but
sufficient
sums
were
soon
receiv
to
procure
the
ground
and
erect
the
building
which
was
one
hundred
feet
long
and
seventy
broad
about
the
size
of
westminster
hall
and
the
work
was
carried
on
with
such
spirit
as
to
be
finished
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
could
have
been
expected
both
house
and
ground
were
vested
in
trustees
expressly
for
the
use
of
any
preacher
of
any
religious
persuasion
who
might
desire
to
say
something
to
the
people
at
philadelphia
the
design
in
building
not
being
to
accommodate
any
particular
sect
but
the
inhabitants
in
general
so
that
even
if
the
mufti
of
constantinople
were
to
send
a
missionary
to
preach
mohammedanism
to
us
he
would
find
a
pulpit
at
his
service
whitefield
in
leaving
us
went
preaching
all
the
way
thro
the
colonies
to
georgia
the
settlement
of
that
province
had
lately
been
begun
but
instead
of
being
made
with
hardy
industrious
husbandmen
accustomed
to
labor
the
only
people
fit
for
such
an
enterprise
it
was
with
families
of
broken
and
other
insolvent
debtors
many
of
indolent
and
idle
habits
taken
out
of
the
jails
who
being
set
down
in
the
woods
unqualified
for
clearing
land
and
unable
to
endure
the
hardships
of
a
new
settlement
perished
in
numbers
leaving
many
helpless
children
unprovided
for
the
sight
of
their
miserable
situation
inspir
the
benevolent
heart
of
whitefield
with
the
idea
of
building
an
orphan
house
there
in
which
they
might
be
supported
and
educated
returning
northward
he
preach
up
this
charity
and
made
large
collections
for
his
eloquence
had
a
wonderful
power
over
the
hearts
and
purses
of
his
hearers
of
which
i
myself
was
an
instance
i
did
not
disapprove
of
the
design
but
as
georgia
was
then
destitute
of
materials
and
workmen
and
it
was
proposed
to
send
them
from
philadelphia
at
a
great
expense
i
thought
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
built
the
house
here
and
brought
the
children
to
it
this
i
advis
but
he
was
resolute
in
his
first
project
rejected
my
counsel
and
i
therefore
refus
to
contribute
i
happened
soon
after
to
attend
one
of
his
sermons
in
the
course
of
which
i
perceived
he
intended
to
finish
with
a
collection
and
i
silently
resolved
he
should
get
nothing
from
me
i
had
in
my
pocket
a
handful
of
copper
money
three
or
four
silver
dollars
and
five
pistoles
in
gold
as
he
proceeded
i
began
to
soften
and
concluded
to
give
the
coppers
another
stroke
of
his
oratory
made
me
asham
of
that
and
determin
me
to
give
the
silver
and
he
finish
so
admirably
that
i
empty
my
pocket
wholly
into
the
collector
dish
gold
and
all
at
this
sermon
there
was
also
one
of
our
club
who
being
of
my
sentiments
respecting
the
building
in
georgia
and
suspecting
a
collection
might
be
intended
had
by
precaution
emptied
his
pockets
before
he
came
from
home
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
discourse
however
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
give
and
apply
to
a
neighbour
who
stood
near
him
to
borrow
some
money
for
the
purpose
the
application
was
unfortunately
made
to
perhaps
the
only
man
in
the
company
who
had
the
firmness
not
to
be
affected
by
the
preacher
his
answer
was
at
any
other
time
friend
hopkinson
i
would
lend
to
thee
freely
but
not
now
for
thee
seems
to
be
out
of
thy
right
senses
some
of
whitefield
enemies
affected
to
suppose
that
he
would
apply
these
collections
to
his
own
private
emolument
but
i
who
was
intimately
acquainted
with
him
being
employed
in
printing
his
sermons
and
journals
etc
never
had
the
least
suspicion
of
his
integrity
but
am
to
this
day
decidedly
of
opinion
that
he
was
in
all
his
conduct
a
perfectly
honest
man
and
methinks
my
testimony
in
his
favour
ought
to
have
the
more
weight
as
we
had
no
religious
connection
he
us
indeed
sometimes
to
pray
for
my
conversion
but
never
had
the
satisfaction
of
believing
that
his
prayers
were
heard
ours
was
a
mere
civil
friendship
sincere
on
both
sides
and
lasted
to
his
death
the
following
instance
will
show
something
of
the
terms
on
which
we
stood
upon
one
of
his
arrivals
from
england
at
boston
he
wrote
to
me
that
he
should
come
soon
to
philadelphia
but
knew
not
where
he
could
lodge
when
there
as
he
understood
his
old
friend
and
host
benezet
was
removed
to
germantown
my
answer
was
you
know
my
house
if
you
can
make
shift
with
its
scanty
accommodations
you
will
be
most
heartily
welcome
he
reply
that
if
i
made
that
kind
offer
for
christ
sake
i
should
not
miss
of
a
reward
and
i
returned
do
let
me
be
mistaken
it
was
not
for
christ
sake
but
for
your
sake
one
of
our
common
acquaintance
jocosely
remark
that
knowing
it
to
be
the
custom
of
the
saints
when
they
received
any
favour
to
shift
the
burden
of
the
obligation
from
off
their
own
shoulders
and
place
it
in
heaven
i
had
contriv
to
fix
it
on
earth
the
last
time
i
saw
whitefield
was
in
london
when
he
consulted
me
about
his
orphan
house
concern
and
his
purpose
of
appropriating
it
to
the
establishment
of
a
college
he
had
a
loud
and
clear
voice
and
articulated
his
words
and
sentences
so
perfectly
that
he
might
be
heard
and
understood
at
a
great
distance
especially
as
his
auditories
however
numerous
observ
the
most
exact
silence
he
preach
one
evening
from
the
top
of
the
steps
which
are
in
the
middle
of
and
on
the
west
side
of
which
crosses
it
at
right
angles
both
streets
were
fill
with
his
hearers
to
a
considerable
distance
being
among
the
hindmost
in
i
had
the
curiosity
to
learn
how
far
he
could
be
heard
by
retiring
backwards
down
the
street
towards
the
river
and
i
found
his
voice
distinct
till
i
came
near
when
some
noise
in
that
street
obscur
it
imagining
then
a
of
which
my
distance
should
be
the
radius
and
that
it
were
fill
with
auditors
to
each
of
whom
i
allow
two
square
feet
i
computed
that
he
might
well
be
heard
by
more
than
thirty
thousand
this
reconcil
me
to
the
newspaper
accounts
of
his
having
preach
to
thousand
people
in
the
fields
and
to
the
ancient
histories
of
generals
haranguing
whole
armies
of
which
i
had
sometimes
doubted
by
hearing
him
often
i
came
to
distinguish
easily
between
sermons
newly
compos
and
those
which
he
had
often
preach
in
the
course
of
his
travels
his
delivery
of
the
latter
was
so
improv
by
frequent
repetitions
that
every
accent
every
emphasis
every
modulation
of
voice
was
so
perfectly
well
turn
and
well
plac
that
without
being
interested
in
the
subject
one
could
not
help
being
pleas
with
the
discourse
a
pleasure
of
much
the
same
kind
with
that
receiv
from
an
excellent
piece
of
musick
this
is
an
advantage
itinerant
preachers
have
over
those
who
are
stationary
as
the
latter
can
not
well
improve
their
delivery
of
a
sermon
by
so
many
rehearsals
his
writing
and
printing
from
time
to
time
gave
great
advantage
to
his
enemies
unguarded
expressions
and
even
erroneous
opinions
delivered
in
preaching
might
have
been
afterwards
explain
or
qualifi
by
supposing
others
that
might
have
accompani
them
or
they
might
have
been
deny
but
litera
scripta
manet
critics
attack
his
writings
violently
and
with
so
much
appearance
of
reason
as
to
diminish
the
number
of
his
votaries
and
prevent
their
encrease
so
that
i
am
of
opinion
if
he
had
never
written
any
thing
he
would
have
left
behind
him
a
much
more
numerous
and
important
sect
and
his
reputation
might
in
that
case
have
been
still
growing
even
after
his
death
as
there
being
nothing
of
his
writing
on
which
to
found
a
censure
and
give
him
a
lower
character
his
proselytes
would
be
left
at
liberty
to
feign
for
him
as
great
a
variety
of
excellence
as
their
enthusiastic
admiration
might
wish
him
to
have
possessed
my
business
was
now
continually
augmenting
and
my
circumstances
growing
daily
easier
my
newspaper
having
become
very
profitable
as
being
for
a
time
almost
the
only
one
in
this
and
the
neighbouring
provinces
i
experienced
too
the
truth
of
the
observation
that
after
getting
the
first
hundred
pound
it
is
more
easy
to
get
the
second
money
itself
being
of
a
prolific
nature
the
partnership
at
carolina
having
succeeded
i
was
encourag
to
engage
in
others
and
to
promote
several
of
my
workmen
who
had
behaved
well
by
establishing
them
with
in
different
colonies
on
the
same
terms
with
that
in
carolina
most
of
them
did
well
being
enabled
at
the
end
of
our
term
six
years
to
purchase
the
types
of
me
and
go
on
working
for
themselves
by
which
means
several
families
were
raised
partnerships
often
finish
in
quarrels
but
i
was
happy
in
this
that
mine
were
all
carried
on
and
ended
amicably
owing
i
think
a
good
deal
to
the
precaution
of
having
very
explicitly
settled
in
our
articles
every
thing
to
be
done
by
or
expected
from
each
partner
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
dispute
which
precaution
i
would
therefore
recommend
to
all
who
enter
into
partnerships
for
whatever
esteem
partners
may
have
for
and
confidence
in
each
other
at
the
time
of
the
contract
little
jealousies
and
disgusts
may
arise
with
ideas
of
inequality
in
the
care
and
burden
of
the
business
which
are
attended
often
with
breach
of
friendship
and
of
the
connection
perhaps
with
lawsuits
and
other
disagreeable
consequences
i
had
on
the
whole
abundant
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
my
being
established
in
pennsylvania
there
were
however
two
things
that
i
regretted
there
being
no
provision
for
defense
nor
for
a
compleat
education
of
youth
no
militia
nor
any
college
i
therefore
in
drew
up
a
proposal
for
establishing
an
academy
and
at
that
time
thinking
the
reverend
peters
who
was
out
of
employ
a
fit
person
to
superintend
such
an
institution
i
communicated
the
project
to
him
but
he
having
more
profitable
views
in
the
service
of
the
proprietaries
which
succeeded
declin
the
undertaking
and
not
knowing
another
at
that
time
suitable
for
such
a
trust
i
let
the
scheme
lie
a
while
dormant
i
succeeded
better
the
next
year
in
proposing
and
establishing
a
philosophical
society
the
paper
i
wrote
for
that
purpose
will
be
found
among
my
writings
when
collected
with
respect
to
defense
spain
having
been
several
years
at
war
against
great
britain
and
being
at
length
join
by
france
which
brought
us
into
great
danger
and
the
laboured
and
endeavour
of
our
governor
thomas
to
prevail
with
our
quaker
assembly
to
pass
a
militia
law
and
make
other
provisions
for
the
security
of
the
province
having
proved
abortive
i
determined
to
try
what
might
be
done
by
a
voluntary
association
of
the
people
to
promote
this
i
first
wrote
and
published
a
pamphlet
entitled
plain
truth
in
which
i
stated
our
defenceless
situation
in
strong
lights
with
the
necessity
of
union
and
discipline
for
our
defense
and
promis
to
propose
in
a
few
days
an
association
to
be
generally
signed
for
that
purpose
the
pamphlet
had
a
sudden
and
surprising
effect
i
was
call
upon
for
the
instrument
of
association
and
having
settled
the
draft
of
it
with
a
few
friends
i
appointed
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
in
the
large
building
before
mentioned
the
house
was
pretty
full
i
had
prepared
a
number
of
printed
copies
and
provided
pens
and
ink
dispers
all
over
the
room
i
harangued
them
a
little
on
the
subject
read
the
paper
and
explained
it
and
then
distributed
the
copies
which
were
eagerly
signed
not
the
least
objection
being
made
when
the
company
separated
and
the
papers
were
collected
we
found
above
twelve
hundred
hands
and
other
copies
being
dispersed
in
the
country
the
subscribers
amounted
at
length
to
upward
of
ten
thousand
these
all
furnished
themselves
as
soon
as
they
could
with
arms
formed
themselves
into
companies
and
regiments
chose
their
own
officers
and
met
every
week
to
be
instructed
in
the
manual
exercise
and
other
parts
of
military
discipline
the
women
by
subscriptions
among
themselves
provided
silk
colors
which
they
presented
to
the
companies
painted
with
different
devices
and
mottos
which
i
supplied
the
officers
of
the
companies
composing
the
philadelphia
regiment
being
met
chose
me
for
their
colonel
but
conceiving
myself
unfit
i
declin
that
station
and
recommended
lawrence
a
fine
person
and
man
of
influence
who
was
accordingly
appointed
i
then
propos
a
lottery
to
defray
the
expense
of
building
a
battery
below
the
town
and
furnishing
it
with
cannon
it
filled
expeditiously
and
the
battery
was
soon
erected
the
merlons
being
fram
of
logs
and
fill
with
earth
we
bought
some
old
cannon
from
boston
but
these
not
being
sufficient
we
wrote
to
england
for
more
soliciting
at
the
same
time
our
proprietaries
for
some
assistance
tho
without
much
expectation
of
obtaining
it
meanwhile
colonel
lawrence
william
allen
abram
taylor
and
myself
were
sent
to
new
york
by
the
associators
commission
to
borrow
some
cannon
of
governor
clinton
he
at
first
refus
us
peremptorily
but
at
dinner
with
his
council
where
there
was
great
drinking
of
madeira
wine
as
the
custom
of
that
place
then
was
he
softened
by
degrees
and
said
he
would
lend
us
six
after
a
few
more
bumpers
he
advanc
to
ten
and
at
length
he
very
conceded
eighteen
they
were
fine
cannon
with
their
carriages
which
we
soon
transported
and
mounted
on
our
battery
where
the
associators
kept
a
nightly
guard
while
the
war
lasted
and
among
the
rest
i
regularly
took
my
turn
of
duty
there
as
a
common
soldier
my
activity
in
these
operations
was
agreeable
to
the
governor
and
council
they
took
me
into
confidence
and
i
was
consulted
by
them
in
every
measure
wherein
their
concurrence
was
thought
useful
to
the
association
calling
in
the
aid
of
religion
i
propos
to
them
the
proclaiming
a
fast
to
promote
reformation
and
implore
the
blessing
of
heaven
on
our
undertaking
they
embrac
the
motion
but
as
it
was
the
first
fast
ever
thought
of
in
the
province
the
secretary
had
no
precedent
from
which
to
draw
the
proclamation
my
education
in
new
england
where
a
fast
is
proclaimed
every
year
was
here
of
some
advantage
i
drew
it
in
the
accustomed
stile
it
was
translated
into
german
printed
in
both
languages
and
divulg
thro
the
province
this
gave
the
clergy
of
the
different
sects
an
opportunity
of
influencing
their
congregations
to
join
in
the
association
and
it
would
probably
have
been
general
among
all
but
quakers
if
the
peace
had
not
soon
interven
it
was
thought
by
some
of
my
friends
that
by
my
activity
in
these
affairs
i
should
offend
that
sect
and
thereby
lose
my
interest
in
the
assembly
of
the
province
where
they
formed
a
great
majority
a
young
gentleman
who
had
likewise
some
friends
in
the
house
and
wished
to
succeed
me
as
their
clerk
acquainted
me
that
it
was
decided
to
displace
me
at
the
next
election
and
he
therefore
in
good
will
advis
me
to
resign
as
more
consistent
with
my
honour
than
being
turn
out
my
answer
to
him
was
that
i
had
read
or
heard
of
some
public
man
who
made
it
a
rule
never
to
ask
for
an
office
and
never
to
refuse
one
when
offer
to
him
i
approve
says
i
of
his
rule
and
will
practice
it
with
a
small
addition
i
shall
never
ask
never
refuse
nor
ever
resign
an
office
if
they
will
have
my
office
of
clerk
to
dispose
of
to
another
they
shall
take
it
from
me
i
will
not
by
giving
it
up
lose
my
right
of
some
time
or
other
making
reprisals
on
my
adversaries
i
heard
however
no
more
of
this
i
was
chosen
again
unanimously
as
usual
at
the
next
election
possibly
as
they
dislik
my
late
intimacy
with
the
members
of
council
who
had
join
the
governors
in
all
the
disputes
about
military
preparations
with
which
the
house
had
long
been
harass
they
might
have
been
pleas
if
i
would
voluntarily
have
left
them
but
they
did
not
care
to
displace
me
on
account
merely
of
my
zeal
for
the
association
and
they
could
not
well
give
another
reason
indeed
i
had
some
cause
to
believe
that
the
defense
of
the
country
was
not
disagreeable
to
any
of
them
provided
they
were
not
requir
to
assist
in
it
and
i
found
that
a
much
greater
number
of
them
than
i
could
have
imagined
tho
against
offensive
war
were
clearly
for
the
defensive
many
pamphlets
pro
and
con
were
publish
on
the
subject
and
some
by
good
quakers
in
favour
of
defense
which
i
believe
most
of
their
younger
people
a
transaction
in
our
fire
company
gave
me
some
insight
into
their
prevailing
sentiments
it
had
been
propos
that
we
should
encourage
the
scheme
for
building
a
battery
by
laying
out
the
present
stock
then
about
sixty
pounds
in
tickets
of
the
lottery
by
our
rules
no
money
could
be
dispos
of
till
the
next
meeting
after
the
proposal
the
company
consisted
of
thirty
members
of
which
were
quakers
and
eight
only
of
other
persuasions
we
eight
punctually
attended
the
meeting
but
tho
we
thought
that
some
of
the
quakers
would
join
us
we
were
by
no
means
sure
of
a
majority
only
one
quaker
james
morris
appear
to
oppose
the
measure
he
expressed
much
sorrow
that
it
had
ever
been
propos
as
he
said
friends
were
all
against
it
and
it
would
create
such
discord
as
might
break
up
the
company
we
told
him
that
we
saw
no
reason
for
that
we
were
the
minority
and
if
friends
were
against
the
measure
and
outvoted
us
we
must
and
should
agreeably
to
the
usage
of
all
societies
submit
when
the
hour
for
business
it
was
mov
to
put
the
vote
he
allow
we
might
then
do
it
by
the
rules
but
as
he
could
assure
us
that
a
number
of
members
intended
to
be
present
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
it
it
would
be
but
candid
to
allow
a
little
time
for
their
appearing
while
we
were
disputing
this
a
waiter
came
to
tell
me
two
gentlemen
below
desir
to
speak
with
me
i
went
down
and
found
they
were
two
of
our
quaker
members
they
told
me
there
were
eight
of
them
assembled
at
a
tavern
just
by
that
they
were
determin
to
come
and
vote
with
us
if
there
should
be
occasion
which
they
hop
would
not
be
the
case
and
desir
we
would
not
call
for
their
assistance
if
we
could
do
without
it
as
their
voting
for
such
a
measure
might
embroil
them
with
their
elders
and
friends
being
thus
secure
of
a
majority
i
went
up
and
after
a
little
seeming
hesitation
agreed
to
a
delay
of
another
hour
this
morris
allow
to
be
extreamly
fair
not
one
of
his
opposing
friends
appear
at
which
he
express
great
surprize
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
hour
we
carry
the
resolution
eight
to
one
and
as
of
the
quakers
eight
were
ready
to
vote
with
us
and
thirteen
by
their
absence
manifested
that
they
were
not
inclin
to
oppose
the
measure
i
afterward
estimated
the
proportion
of
quakers
sincerely
against
defense
as
one
to
only
for
these
were
all
regular
members
of
that
society
and
in
good
reputation
among
them
and
had
due
notice
of
what
was
propos
at
that
meeting
the
honorable
and
learned
logan
who
had
always
been
of
that
sect
was
one
who
wrote
an
address
to
them
declaring
his
approbation
of
defensive
war
and
supporting
his
opinion
by
many
strong
arguments
he
put
into
my
hands
sixty
pounds
to
be
laid
out
in
lottery
tickets
for
the
battery
with
directions
to
apply
what
prizes
might
be
drawn
wholly
to
that
service
he
told
me
the
following
anecdote
of
his
old
master
william
penn
respecting
defense
he
came
over
from
england
when
a
young
man
with
that
proprietary
and
as
his
secretary
it
was
and
their
ship
was
chas
by
an
armed
vessel
suppos
to
be
an
enemy
their
captain
prepar
for
defense
but
told
william
penn
and
his
company
of
quakers
that
he
did
not
expect
their
assistance
and
they
might
retire
into
the
cabin
which
they
did
except
james
logan
who
chose
to
stay
upon
deck
and
was
quarter
to
a
gun
the
suppos
enemy
prov
a
friend
so
there
was
no
fighting
but
when
the
secretary
went
down
to
communicate
the
intelligence
william
penn
rebuk
him
severely
for
staying
upon
deck
and
undertaking
to
assist
in
defending
the
vessel
contrary
to
the
principles
of
friends
especially
as
it
had
not
been
required
by
the
captain
this
reproof
being
before
all
the
company
piqu
the
secretary
who
answer
i
being
thy
servant
why
did
thee
not
order
me
to
come
down
but
thee
was
willing
enough
that
i
should
stay
and
help
to
fight
the
ship
when
thee
thought
there
was
danger
my
being
many
years
in
the
assembly
the
majority
of
which
were
constantly
quakers
gave
me
frequent
opportunities
of
seeing
the
embarrassment
given
them
by
their
principle
against
war
whenever
application
was
made
to
them
by
order
of
the
crown
to
grant
aids
for
military
purposes
they
were
unwilling
to
offend
government
on
the
one
hand
by
a
direct
refusal
and
their
friends
the
body
of
the
quakers
on
the
other
by
a
compliance
contrary
to
their
principles
hence
a
variety
of
evasions
to
avoid
complying
and
modes
of
disguising
the
compliance
when
it
became
unavoidable
the
common
mode
at
last
was
to
grant
money
under
the
phrase
of
its
being
for
the
king
use
and
never
to
inquire
how
it
was
applied
but
if
the
demand
was
not
directly
from
the
crown
that
phrase
was
found
not
so
proper
and
some
other
was
to
be
invented
as
when
powder
was
wanting
i
think
it
was
for
the
garrison
at
louisburg
and
the
government
of
new
england
solicited
a
grant
of
some
from
pennsilvania
which
was
much
urg
on
the
house
by
governor
thomas
they
could
not
grant
money
to
buy
powder
because
that
was
an
ingredient
of
war
but
they
voted
an
aid
to
new
england
of
three
thousand
pounds
to
be
put
into
the
hands
of
the
governor
and
appropriated
it
for
the
purchasing
of
bread
flour
wheat
or
other
grain
some
of
the
council
desirous
of
giving
the
house
still
further
embarrassment
advis
the
governor
not
to
accept
provision
as
not
being
the
thing
he
had
demanded
but
be
reply
i
shall
take
the
money
for
i
understand
very
well
their
meaning
other
grain
is
gunpowder
which
he
accordingly
bought
and
they
never
objected
to
it
see
the
marg
note
it
was
in
allusion
to
this
fact
that
when
in
our
fire
company
we
feared
the
success
of
our
proposal
in
favour
of
the
lottery
and
i
had
said
to
my
friend
syng
one
of
our
members
if
we
fail
let
us
move
the
purchase
of
a
with
the
money
the
quakers
can
have
no
objection
to
that
and
then
if
you
nominate
me
and
i
you
as
a
committee
for
that
purpose
we
will
buy
a
great
gun
which
is
certainly
a
i
see
says
he
you
have
improv
by
being
so
long
in
the
assembly
your
equivocal
project
would
be
just
a
match
for
their
wheat
or
other
grain
these
embarrassments
that
the
quakers
suffer
from
having
and
published
it
as
one
of
their
principles
that
no
kind
of
war
was
lawful
and
which
being
once
published
they
could
not
afterwards
however
they
might
change
their
minds
easily
get
rid
of
reminds
me
of
what
i
think
a
more
prudent
conduct
in
another
sect
among
us
that
of
the
dunkers
i
was
acquainted
with
one
of
its
founders
michael
welfare
soon
after
it
appear
he
complain
to
me
that
they
were
grievously
calumniated
by
the
zealots
of
other
persuasions
and
charg
with
abominable
principles
and
practices
to
which
they
were
utter
strangers
i
told
him
this
had
always
been
the
case
with
new
sects
and
that
to
put
a
stop
to
such
abuse
i
imagin
it
might
be
well
to
publish
the
articles
of
their
belief
and
the
rules
of
their
discipline
he
said
that
it
had
been
propos
among
them
but
not
agreed
to
for
this
reason
when
we
were
first
drawn
together
as
a
society
says
he
it
had
pleased
god
to
enlighten
our
minds
so
far
as
to
see
that
some
doctrines
which
we
once
esteemed
truths
were
errors
and
that
others
which
we
had
esteemed
errors
were
real
truths
from
time
to
time
he
has
been
pleased
to
afford
us
farther
light
and
our
principles
have
been
improving
and
our
errors
diminishing
now
we
are
not
sure
that
we
are
arrived
at
the
end
of
this
progression
and
at
the
perfection
of
spiritual
or
theological
knowledge
and
we
fear
that
if
we
should
once
print
our
confession
of
faith
we
should
feel
ourselves
as
if
bound
and
confin
by
it
and
perhaps
be
unwilling
to
receive
farther
improvement
and
our
successors
still
more
so
as
conceiving
what
we
their
elders
and
founders
had
done
to
be
something
sacred
never
to
be
departed
from
this
modesty
in
a
sect
is
perhaps
a
singular
instance
in
the
history
of
mankind
every
other
sect
supposing
itself
in
possession
of
all
truth
and
that
those
who
differ
are
so
far
in
the
wrong
like
a
man
traveling
in
foggy
weather
those
at
some
distance
before
him
on
the
road
he
sees
wrapped
up
in
the
fog
as
well
as
those
behind
him
and
also
the
people
in
the
fields
on
each
side
but
near
him
all
appears
clear
tho
in
truth
he
is
as
much
in
the
fog
as
any
of
them
to
avoid
this
kind
of
embarrassment
the
quakers
have
of
late
years
been
gradually
declining
the
public
service
in
the
assembly
and
in
the
magistracy
choosing
rather
to
quit
their
power
than
their
principle
in
order
of
time
i
should
have
mentioned
before
that
having
in
invented
an
open
stove
for
the
better
warming
of
rooms
and
at
the
same
time
saving
fuel
as
the
fresh
air
admitted
was
warmed
in
entering
i
made
a
present
of
the
model
to
robert
grace
one
of
my
early
friends
who
having
an
found
the
casting
of
the
plates
for
these
stoves
a
profitable
thing
as
they
were
growing
in
demand
to
promote
that
demand
i
wrote
and
published
a
pamphlet
entitled
an
account
of
the
pennsylvania
fireplaces
wherein
their
construction
and
manner
of
operation
is
particularly
explained
their
advantages
above
every
other
method
of
warming
rooms
demonstrated
and
all
objections
that
have
been
raised
against
the
use
of
them
answered
and
obviated
etc
this
pamphlet
had
a
good
effect
thomas
was
so
pleas
with
the
construction
of
this
stove
as
described
in
it
that
he
offered
to
give
me
a
patent
for
the
sole
vending
of
them
for
a
term
of
years
but
i
declin
it
from
a
principle
which
has
ever
weighed
with
me
on
such
occasions
that
as
we
enjoy
great
advantages
from
the
inventions
of
others
we
should
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
serve
others
by
any
invention
of
ours
and
this
we
should
do
freely
and
generously
an
ironmonger
in
london
however
assuming
a
good
deal
of
my
pamphlet
and
working
it
up
into
his
own
and
making
some
small
changes
in
the
machine
which
rather
hurt
its
operation
got
a
patent
for
it
there
and
made
as
i
was
told
a
little
fortune
by
it
and
this
is
not
the
only
instance
of
patents
taken
out
for
my
inventions
by
others
tho
not
always
with
the
same
success
which
i
never
contested
as
having
no
desire
of
profiting
by
patents
myself
and
hating
disputes
the
use
of
these
fireplaces
in
very
many
houses
both
of
this
and
the
neighbouring
colonies
has
been
and
is
a
great
saving
of
wood
to
the
inhabitants
peace
being
concluded
and
the
association
business
therefore
at
an
end
i
turn
my
thoughts
again
to
the
affair
of
establishing
an
academy
the
first
step
i
took
was
to
associate
in
the
design
a
number
of
active
friends
of
whom
the
junto
furnished
a
good
part
the
next
was
to
write
and
publish
a
pamphlet
entitled
proposals
relating
to
the
education
of
youth
in
pennsylvania
this
i
distributed
among
the
principal
inhabitants
gratis
and
as
soon
as
i
could
suppose
their
minds
a
little
prepared
by
the
perusal
of
it
i
set
on
foot
a
subscription
for
opening
and
supporting
an
academy
it
was
to
be
paid
in
quotas
yearly
for
five
years
by
so
dividing
it
i
judg
the
subscription
might
be
larger
and
i
believe
it
was
so
amounting
to
no
less
if
i
remember
right
than
five
thousand
pounds
in
the
introduction
to
these
proposals
i
stated
their
publication
not
as
an
act
of
mine
but
of
some
gentlemen
avoiding
as
much
as
i
could
according
to
my
usual
rule
the
presenting
myself
to
the
publick
as
the
author
of
any
scheme
for
their
benefit
the
subscribers
to
carry
the
project
into
immediate
execution
chose
out
of
their
number
trustees
and
appointed
francis
then
and
myself
to
draw
up
constitutions
for
the
government
of
the
academy
which
being
done
and
signed
a
house
was
hired
masters
engag
and
the
schools
opened
i
think
in
the
same
year
the
scholars
increasing
fast
the
house
was
soon
found
too
small
and
we
were
looking
out
for
a
piece
of
ground
properly
situated
with
intention
to
build
when
providence
threw
into
our
way
a
large
house
ready
built
which
with
a
few
alterations
might
well
serve
our
purpose
this
was
the
building
before
mentioned
erected
by
the
hearers
of
whitefield
and
was
obtained
for
us
in
the
following
manner
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
contributions
to
this
building
being
made
by
people
of
different
sects
care
was
taken
in
the
nomination
of
trustees
in
whom
the
building
and
ground
was
to
be
vested
that
a
predominancy
should
not
be
given
to
any
sect
lest
in
time
that
predominancy
might
be
a
means
of
appropriating
the
whole
to
the
use
of
such
sect
contrary
to
the
original
intention
it
was
therefore
that
one
of
each
sect
was
appointed
one
man
one
presbyterian
one
baptist
one
moravian
those
in
case
of
vacancy
by
death
were
to
fill
it
by
election
from
among
the
contributors
the
moravian
not
to
please
his
colleagues
and
on
his
death
they
resolved
to
have
no
other
of
that
sect
the
difficulty
then
was
how
to
avoid
having
two
of
some
other
sect
by
means
of
the
new
choice
several
persons
were
named
and
for
that
reason
not
agreed
to
at
length
one
mention
me
with
the
observation
that
i
was
merely
an
honest
man
and
of
no
sect
at
all
which
prevail
with
them
to
chuse
me
the
enthusiasm
which
existed
when
the
house
was
built
had
long
since
abated
and
its
trustees
had
not
been
able
to
procure
fresh
contributions
for
paying
the
and
discharging
some
other
debts
the
building
had
occasion
which
embarrass
them
greatly
being
now
a
member
of
both
setts
of
trustees
that
for
the
building
and
that
for
the
academy
i
had
a
good
opportunity
of
negotiating
with
both
and
brought
them
finally
to
an
agreement
by
which
the
trustees
for
the
building
were
to
cede
it
to
those
of
the
academy
the
latter
undertaking
to
discharge
the
debt
to
keep
for
ever
open
in
the
building
a
large
hall
for
occasional
preachers
according
to
the
original
intention
and
maintain
a
for
the
instruction
of
poor
children
writings
were
accordingly
drawn
and
on
paying
the
debts
the
trustees
of
the
academy
were
put
in
possession
of
the
premises
and
by
dividing
the
great
and
lofty
hall
into
stories
and
different
rooms
above
and
below
for
the
several
schools
and
purchasing
some
additional
ground
the
whole
was
soon
made
fit
for
our
purpose
and
the
scholars
remov
into
the
building
the
care
and
trouble
of
agreeing
with
the
workmen
purchasing
materials
and
superintending
the
work
fell
upon
me
and
i
went
it
the
more
cheerfully
as
it
did
not
then
interfere
with
my
private
business
having
the
year
before
taken
a
very
able
industrious
and
honest
partner
david
hall
with
whose
character
i
was
well
acquainted
as
he
had
work
for
me
four
years
he
took
off
my
hands
all
care
of
the
paying
me
punctually
my
share
of
the
profits
this
partnership
continued
eighteen
years
successfully
for
us
both
the
trustees
of
the
academy
after
a
while
were
incorporated
by
a
charter
from
the
governor
their
funds
were
increas
by
contributions
in
britain
and
grants
of
land
from
the
proprietaries
to
which
the
assembly
has
since
made
considerable
addition
and
thus
was
established
the
present
university
of
philadelphia
i
have
been
continued
one
of
its
trustees
from
the
beginning
now
near
forty
years
and
have
had
the
very
great
pleasure
of
seeing
a
number
of
the
youth
who
have
receiv
their
education
in
it
distinguish
by
their
improv
abilities
serviceable
in
public
stations
and
ornaments
to
their
country
when
i
disengaged
myself
as
above
mentioned
from
private
business
i
flatter
myself
that
by
the
sufficient
tho
moderate
fortune
i
had
acquir
i
had
secured
leisure
during
the
rest
of
my
life
for
philosophical
studies
and
amusements
i
purchased
all
apparatus
who
had
come
from
england
to
lecture
here
and
i
proceeded
in
my
electrical
experiments
with
great
alacrity
but
the
publick
now
considering
me
as
a
man
of
leisure
laid
hold
of
me
for
their
purposes
every
part
of
our
civil
government
and
almost
at
the
same
time
imposing
some
duty
upon
me
the
governor
put
me
into
the
commission
of
the
peace
the
corporation
of
the
city
chose
me
of
the
common
council
and
soon
after
an
alderman
and
the
citizens
at
large
chose
me
a
burgess
to
represent
them
in
assembly
this
latter
station
was
the
more
agreeable
to
me
as
i
was
at
length
tired
with
sitting
there
to
hear
debates
in
which
as
clerk
i
could
take
no
part
and
which
were
often
so
unentertaining
that
i
was
induc
to
amuse
myself
with
making
magic
squares
or
circles
or
any
thing
to
avoid
weariness
and
i
conceiv
my
becoming
a
member
would
enlarge
my
power
of
doing
good
i
would
not
however
insinuate
that
my
ambition
was
not
flatter
by
all
these
promotions
it
certainly
was
for
considering
my
low
beginning
they
were
great
things
to
me
and
they
were
still
more
pleasing
as
being
so
many
spontaneous
testimonies
of
the
public
good
opinion
and
by
me
entirely
unsolicited
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
i
try
a
little
by
attending
a
few
courts
and
sitting
on
the
bench
to
hear
causes
but
finding
that
more
knowledge
of
the
common
law
than
i
possess
was
necessary
to
act
in
that
station
with
credit
i
gradually
withdrew
from
it
excusing
myself
by
my
being
oblig
to
attend
the
higher
duties
of
a
legislator
in
the
assembly
my
election
to
this
trust
was
repeated
every
year
for
ten
years
without
my
ever
asking
any
elector
for
his
vote
or
signifying
either
directly
or
indirectly
any
desire
of
being
chosen
on
taking
my
seat
in
the
house
my
son
was
appointed
their
clerk
the
year
following
a
treaty
being
to
be
held
with
the
indians
at
carlisle
the
governor
sent
a
message
to
the
house
proposing
that
they
should
nominate
some
of
their
members
to
be
join
with
some
members
of
council
as
commissioners
for
that
purpose
the
house
named
the
speaker
norris
and
myself
and
being
commission
we
went
to
carlisle
and
met
the
indians
accordingly
see
the
votes
to
have
this
more
marg
note
as
those
people
are
extreamly
apt
to
get
drunk
and
when
so
are
very
quarrelsome
and
disorderly
we
strictly
forbad
the
selling
any
liquor
to
them
and
when
they
complain
of
this
restriction
we
told
them
that
if
they
would
continue
sober
during
the
treaty
we
would
give
them
plenty
of
rum
when
business
was
over
they
promis
this
and
they
kept
their
promise
because
they
could
get
no
liquor
and
the
treaty
was
conducted
very
orderly
and
concluded
to
mutual
satisfaction
they
then
and
receiv
the
rum
this
was
in
the
afternoon
they
were
near
one
hundred
men
women
and
children
and
were
lodg
in
temporary
cabins
built
in
the
form
of
a
square
just
without
the
town
in
the
evening
hearing
a
great
noise
among
them
the
commissioners
walk
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
we
found
they
had
made
a
great
bonfire
in
the
middle
of
the
square
they
were
all
drunk
men
and
women
quarreling
and
fighting
their
bodies
half
naked
seen
only
by
the
gloomy
light
of
the
bonfire
running
after
and
beating
one
another
with
firebrands
accompanied
by
their
horrid
yellings
form
a
scene
the
most
resembling
our
ideas
of
hell
that
could
well
be
imagin
there
was
no
appeasing
the
tumult
and
we
retired
to
our
lodging
at
midnight
a
number
of
them
came
thundering
at
our
door
demanding
more
rum
of
which
we
took
no
notice
the
next
day
sensible
they
had
misbehav
in
giving
us
that
disturbance
they
sent
three
of
their
old
counselors
to
make
their
apology
the
orator
acknowledg
the
fault
but
laid
it
upon
the
rum
and
then
endeavored
to
excuse
the
rum
by
saying
the
great
spirit
who
made
all
things
made
every
thing
for
some
use
and
whatever
use
he
design
any
thing
for
that
use
it
should
always
be
put
to
now
when
he
made
rum
he
said
this
be
for
the
indians
to
get
drunk
with
and
it
must
be
so
and
indeed
if
it
be
the
design
of
providence
to
extirpate
these
savages
in
order
to
make
room
for
cultivators
of
the
earth
it
seems
not
improbable
that
rum
may
be
the
appointed
means
it
has
already
annihilated
all
the
tribes
who
formerly
inhabited
the
in
thomas
bond
a
particular
friend
of
mine
conceived
the
idea
of
establishing
a
hospital
in
philadelphia
a
very
beneficent
design
which
has
been
ascrib
to
me
but
was
originally
his
for
the
reception
and
cure
of
poor
sick
persons
whether
inhabitants
of
the
province
or
strangers
he
was
zealous
and
active
in
endeavouring
to
procure
subscriptions
for
it
but
the
proposal
being
a
novelty
in
america
and
at
first
not
well
understood
he
met
but
with
small
success
at
length
he
came
to
me
with
the
compliment
that
he
found
there
was
no
such
thing
as
carrying
a
project
through
without
my
being
concern
in
it
for
says
he
i
am
often
ask
by
those
to
whom
i
propose
subscribing
have
you
consulted
franklin
upon
this
business
and
what
does
he
think
of
it
and
when
i
tell
them
that
i
have
not
supposing
it
rather
out
of
your
line
they
do
not
subscribe
but
say
they
will
consider
of
it
i
enquired
into
the
nature
and
probable
utility
of
his
scheme
and
receiving
from
him
a
very
satisfactory
explanation
i
not
only
subscrib
to
it
myself
but
engag
heartily
in
the
design
of
procuring
subscriptions
from
others
previously
however
to
the
solicitation
i
endeavoured
to
prepare
the
minds
of
the
people
by
writing
on
the
subject
in
the
newspapers
which
was
my
usual
custom
in
such
cases
but
which
he
had
omitted
the
subscriptions
afterwards
were
more
free
and
generous
but
beginning
to
flag
i
saw
they
would
be
insufficient
without
some
assistance
from
the
assembly
and
therefore
propos
to
petition
for
it
which
was
done
the
country
members
did
not
at
first
relish
the
project
they
objected
that
it
could
only
be
serviceable
to
the
city
and
therefore
the
citizens
alone
should
be
at
the
expense
of
it
and
they
doubted
whether
the
citizens
themselves
generally
approv
of
it
my
allegation
on
the
contrary
that
it
met
with
such
approbation
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
our
being
able
to
raise
two
thousand
pounds
by
voluntary
donations
they
considered
as
a
most
extravagant
supposition
and
utterly
impossible
on
this
i
form
my
plan
and
asking
leave
to
bring
in
a
bill
for
incorporating
the
contributors
according
to
the
prayer
of
their
petition
and
granting
them
a
blank
sum
of
money
which
leave
was
obtained
chiefly
on
the
consideration
that
the
house
could
throw
the
bill
out
if
they
did
not
like
it
i
drew
it
so
as
to
make
the
important
clause
a
conditional
one
and
be
it
enacted
by
the
authority
aforesaid
that
when
the
said
contributors
shall
have
met
and
chosen
their
managers
and
treasurer
and
shall
have
raised
by
their
contributions
a
capital
stock
of
value
the
yearly
interest
of
which
is
to
be
applied
to
the
accommodating
of
the
sick
poor
in
the
said
hospital
free
of
charge
for
diet
attendance
advice
and
medicines
and
shall
make
the
same
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
speaker
of
the
assembly
for
the
time
being
that
then
it
shall
and
may
be
lawful
for
the
said
speaker
and
he
is
hereby
required
to
sign
an
order
on
the
provincial
treasurer
for
the
payment
of
two
thousand
pounds
in
two
yearly
payments
to
the
treasurer
of
the
said
hospital
to
be
applied
to
the
founding
building
and
finishing
of
the
same
this
condition
carried
the
bill
through
for
the
members
who
had
oppos
the
grant
and
now
conceiv
they
might
have
the
credit
of
being
charitable
without
the
expence
agreed
to
its
passage
and
then
in
soliciting
subscriptions
among
the
people
we
urg
the
conditional
promise
of
the
law
as
an
additional
motive
to
give
since
every
donation
would
be
doubled
thus
the
clause
work
both
ways
the
subscriptions
accordingly
soon
exceeded
the
requisite
sum
and
we
claim
and
receiv
the
public
gift
which
enabled
us
to
carry
the
design
into
execution
a
convenient
and
handsome
building
was
soon
erected
the
institution
has
by
constant
experience
been
found
useful
and
flourishes
to
this
day
and
i
do
not
remember
any
of
my
political
manœuvres
the
success
of
which
gave
me
at
the
time
more
pleasure
or
wherein
after
thinking
of
it
i
more
easily
excus
myself
for
having
made
some
use
of
cunning
it
was
about
this
time
that
another
projector
the
rev
gilbert
tennent
came
to
me
with
a
request
that
i
would
assist
him
in
procuring
a
subscription
for
erecting
a
new
it
was
to
be
for
the
use
of
a
congregation
he
had
gathered
among
the
presbyterians
who
were
originally
disciples
of
whitefield
unwilling
to
make
myself
disagreeable
to
my
by
too
frequently
soliciting
their
contributions
i
absolutely
refus
he
then
desired
i
would
furnish
him
with
a
list
of
the
names
of
persons
i
knew
by
experience
to
be
generous
and
i
thought
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
me
after
their
kind
compliance
with
my
solicitations
to
mark
them
out
to
be
worried
by
other
beggars
and
therefore
refus
also
to
give
such
a
list
he
then
desir
i
would
at
least
give
him
my
advice
that
i
will
readily
do
said
i
and
in
the
first
place
i
advise
you
to
apply
to
all
those
whom
you
know
will
give
something
next
to
those
whom
you
are
uncertain
whether
they
will
give
any
thing
or
not
and
show
them
the
list
of
those
who
have
given
and
lastly
do
not
neglect
those
who
you
are
sure
will
give
nothing
for
in
some
of
them
you
may
be
mistaken
he
laugh
and
thank
me
and
said
he
would
take
my
advice
he
did
so
for
he
ask
of
everybody
and
he
obtained
a
much
larger
sum
than
he
expected
with
which
he
erected
the
capacious
and
very
elegant
that
stands
in
our
city
tho
laid
out
with
a
beautiful
regularity
the
streets
large
strait
and
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
had
the
disgrace
of
suffering
those
streets
to
remain
long
unpav
and
in
wet
weather
the
wheels
of
heavy
carriages
plough
them
into
a
quagmire
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
cross
them
and
in
dry
weather
the
dust
was
offensive
i
had
liv
near
what
was
call
the
jersey
market
and
saw
with
pain
the
inhabitants
wading
in
mud
while
purchasing
their
provisions
a
strip
of
ground
down
the
middle
of
that
market
was
at
length
pav
with
brick
so
that
being
once
in
the
market
they
had
firm
footing
but
were
often
over
shoes
in
dirt
to
get
there
by
talking
and
writing
on
the
subject
i
was
at
length
instrumental
in
getting
the
street
pav
with
stone
between
the
market
and
the
brick
that
was
on
each
side
next
the
houses
this
for
some
time
gave
an
easy
access
to
the
market
but
the
rest
of
the
street
not
being
pav
whenever
a
carriage
came
out
of
the
mud
upon
this
pavement
it
shook
off
and
left
its
dirt
upon
it
and
it
was
soon
cover
with
mire
which
was
not
remov
the
city
as
yet
having
no
scavengers
after
some
inquiry
i
found
a
poor
industrious
man
who
was
willing
to
undertake
keeping
the
pavement
clean
by
sweeping
it
twice
a
week
carrying
off
the
dirt
from
before
all
the
neighbours
doors
for
the
sum
of
sixpence
per
month
to
be
paid
by
each
house
i
then
wrote
and
printed
a
paper
setting
forth
the
advantages
to
the
neighbourhood
that
might
be
obtain
by
this
small
expense
the
greater
ease
in
keeping
our
houses
clean
so
much
dirt
not
being
brought
in
by
people
feet
the
benefit
to
the
shops
by
more
custom
as
buyers
could
more
easily
get
at
them
and
by
not
having
in
windy
weather
the
dust
blown
in
upon
their
goods
etc
i
sent
one
of
these
papers
to
each
house
and
in
a
day
or
two
went
round
to
see
who
would
subscribe
an
agreement
to
pay
these
sixpences
it
was
unanimously
sign
and
for
a
time
well
executed
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
delighted
with
the
cleanliness
of
the
pavement
that
surrounded
the
market
it
being
a
convenience
to
all
and
this
rais
a
general
desire
to
have
all
the
streets
paved
and
made
the
people
more
willing
to
submit
to
a
tax
for
that
purpose
after
some
time
i
drew
a
bill
for
paving
the
city
and
brought
it
into
the
assembly
it
was
just
before
i
went
to
england
in
and
did
not
pass
till
i
was
gone
and
then
with
an
alteration
in
the
mode
of
assessment
which
i
thought
not
for
the
better
but
with
an
additional
provision
for
lighting
as
well
as
paving
the
streets
which
was
a
great
improvement
it
was
by
a
private
person
the
late
john
clifton
his
giving
a
sample
of
the
utility
of
lamps
by
placing
one
at
his
door
that
the
people
were
first
impress
with
the
idea
of
enlighting
all
the
city
the
honour
of
this
public
benefit
has
also
been
ascrib
to
me
but
it
belongs
truly
to
that
gentleman
i
did
but
follow
his
example
and
have
only
some
merit
to
claim
respecting
the
form
of
our
lamps
as
differing
from
the
globe
lamps
we
were
at
first
supply
with
from
london
those
we
found
inconvenient
in
these
respects
they
admitted
no
air
below
the
smoke
therefore
did
not
readily
go
out
above
but
circulated
in
the
globe
lodg
on
its
inside
and
soon
obstructed
the
light
they
were
intended
to
afford
giving
besides
the
daily
trouble
of
wiping
them
clean
and
an
accidental
stroke
on
one
of
them
would
demolish
it
and
render
it
totally
useless
i
therefore
suggested
the
composing
them
of
four
flat
panes
with
a
long
funnel
above
to
draw
up
the
smoke
and
crevices
admitting
air
below
to
facilitate
the
ascent
of
the
smoke
by
this
means
they
were
kept
clean
and
did
not
grow
dark
in
a
few
hours
as
the
london
lamps
do
but
continu
bright
till
morning
and
an
accidental
stroke
would
generally
break
but
a
single
pane
easily
repair
see
votes
i
have
sometimes
wonder
that
the
londoners
did
not
from
the
effect
holes
in
the
bottom
of
the
globe
lamps
us
at
vauxhall
have
in
keeping
them
clean
learn
to
have
such
holes
in
their
street
lamps
but
these
holes
being
made
for
another
purpose
to
communicate
flame
more
suddenly
to
the
wick
by
a
little
flax
hanging
down
thro
them
the
other
use
of
letting
in
air
seems
not
to
have
been
thought
of
and
therefore
after
the
lamps
have
been
lit
a
few
hours
the
streets
of
london
are
very
poorly
illuminated
the
mention
of
these
improvements
puts
me
in
mind
of
one
i
propos
when
in
london
to
fothergill
who
was
among
the
best
men
i
have
known
and
a
great
promoter
of
useful
projects
i
had
observ
that
the
streets
when
dry
were
never
swept
and
the
light
dust
carried
away
but
it
was
suffer
to
accumulate
till
wet
weather
reduc
it
to
mud
and
then
after
lying
some
days
so
deep
on
the
pavement
that
there
was
no
crossing
but
in
paths
kept
clean
by
poor
people
with
brooms
it
was
with
great
labour
rak
together
and
thrown
up
into
carts
open
above
the
sides
of
which
suffer
some
of
the
slush
at
every
jolt
on
the
pavement
to
shake
out
and
fall
sometimes
to
the
annoyance
of
the
reason
given
for
not
sweeping
the
dusty
streets
was
that
the
dust
would
fly
into
the
windows
of
shops
and
houses
an
accidental
occurrence
had
instructed
me
how
much
sweeping
might
be
done
in
a
little
time
i
found
at
my
door
in
one
morning
a
poor
woman
sweeping
my
pavement
with
a
birch
broom
she
appeared
very
pale
and
feeble
as
just
come
out
of
a
fit
of
sickness
i
ask
who
employ
her
to
sweep
there
she
said
nobody
but
i
am
very
poor
and
in
distress
and
i
sweeps
before
gentlefolkses
doors
and
hopes
they
will
give
me
something
i
bid
her
sweep
the
whole
street
clean
and
i
would
give
her
a
shilling
this
was
at
nine
at
she
came
for
the
shilling
from
the
slowness
i
saw
at
first
in
her
working
i
could
scarce
believe
that
the
work
was
done
so
soon
and
sent
my
servant
to
examine
it
who
reported
that
the
whole
street
was
swept
perfectly
clean
and
all
the
dust
plac
in
the
gutter
which
was
in
the
middle
and
the
next
rain
wash
it
quite
away
so
that
the
pavement
and
even
the
kennel
were
perfectly
clean
i
then
judg
that
if
that
feeble
woman
could
sweep
such
a
street
in
three
hours
a
strong
active
man
might
have
done
it
in
half
the
time
and
here
let
me
remark
the
convenience
of
having
but
one
gutter
in
such
a
narrow
street
running
down
its
middle
instead
of
two
one
on
each
side
near
the
footway
for
where
all
the
rain
that
falls
on
a
street
runs
from
the
sides
and
meets
in
the
middle
it
forms
there
a
current
strong
enough
to
wash
away
all
the
mud
it
meets
with
but
when
divided
into
two
channels
it
is
often
too
weak
to
cleanse
either
and
only
makes
the
mud
it
finds
more
fluid
so
that
the
wheels
of
carriages
and
feet
of
horses
throw
and
dash
it
upon
the
which
is
thereby
rendered
foul
and
slippery
and
sometimes
splash
it
upon
those
who
are
walking
my
proposal
communicated
to
the
good
doctor
was
as
follows
for
the
more
effectual
cleaning
and
keeping
clean
the
streets
of
london
and
westminster
it
is
proposed
that
the
several
watchmen
be
contracted
with
to
have
the
dust
swept
up
in
dry
seasons
and
the
mud
rak
up
at
other
times
each
in
the
several
streets
and
lanes
of
his
round
that
they
be
furnish
with
brooms
and
other
proper
instruments
for
these
purposes
to
be
kept
at
their
respective
stands
ready
to
furnish
the
poor
people
they
may
employ
in
the
service
that
in
the
dry
summer
months
the
dust
be
all
swept
up
into
heaps
at
proper
distances
before
the
shops
and
windows
of
houses
are
usually
opened
when
the
scavengers
with
carts
shall
also
carry
it
all
away
that
the
mud
when
rak
up
be
not
left
in
heaps
to
be
spread
abroad
again
by
the
wheels
of
carriages
and
trampling
of
horses
but
that
the
scavengers
be
provided
with
bodies
of
carts
not
plac
high
upon
wheels
but
low
upon
sliders
with
lattice
bottoms
which
being
with
straw
will
retain
the
mud
thrown
into
them
and
permit
the
water
to
drain
from
it
whereby
it
will
become
much
lighter
water
making
the
greatest
part
of
its
weight
these
bodies
of
carts
to
be
plac
at
convenient
distances
and
the
mud
brought
to
them
in
they
remaining
where
plac
till
the
mud
is
drain
and
then
horses
brought
to
draw
them
away
i
have
since
had
doubts
of
the
practicability
of
the
latter
part
of
this
proposal
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
some
streets
and
the
difficulty
of
placing
the
so
as
not
to
encumber
too
much
the
passage
but
i
am
still
of
opinion
that
the
former
requiring
the
dust
to
be
swept
up
and
carry
away
before
the
shops
are
open
is
very
practicable
in
the
summer
when
the
days
are
long
for
in
walking
the
strand
and
one
morning
at
seven
i
there
was
not
one
shop
open
tho
it
had
been
daylight
and
the
sun
up
above
three
hours
the
inhabitants
of
london
chusing
voluntarily
to
live
much
by
and
sleep
by
sunshine
and
yet
often
complain
a
little
absurdly
of
the
duty
on
candles
and
the
high
price
of
tallow
some
may
think
these
trifling
matters
not
worth
minding
or
relating
but
when
they
consider
that
tho
dust
blown
into
the
eyes
of
a
single
person
or
into
a
single
shop
on
a
windy
day
is
but
of
small
importance
yet
the
great
number
of
the
instances
in
a
populous
city
and
its
frequent
repetitions
give
it
weight
and
consequence
perhaps
they
will
not
censure
very
severely
those
who
bestow
some
attention
to
affairs
of
this
seemingly
low
nature
human
felicity
is
produc
not
so
much
by
great
pieces
of
good
fortune
that
seldom
happen
as
by
little
advantages
that
occur
every
day
thus
if
you
teach
a
poor
young
man
to
shave
himself
and
keep
his
razor
in
order
you
may
contribute
more
to
the
happiness
of
his
life
than
in
giving
him
a
thousand
guineas
the
money
may
be
soon
spent
the
regret
only
remaining
of
having
foolishly
consumed
it
but
in
the
other
case
he
escapes
the
frequent
vexation
of
waiting
for
barbers
and
of
their
sometimes
dirty
fingers
offensive
breaths
and
dull
razors
he
shaves
when
most
convenient
to
him
and
enjoys
daily
the
pleasure
of
its
being
done
with
a
good
instrument
with
these
sentiments
i
have
hazarded
the
few
preceding
pages
hoping
they
may
afford
hints
which
some
time
or
other
may
be
useful
to
a
city
i
love
having
lived
many
years
in
it
very
happily
and
perhaps
to
some
of
our
towns
in
america
having
been
for
some
time
employed
by
the
of
america
as
his
comptroller
in
regulating
several
offices
and
bringing
the
officers
to
account
i
was
upon
his
death
in
appointed
jointly
with
william
hunter
to
succeed
him
by
a
commission
from
the
in
england
the
american
office
never
had
hitherto
paid
any
thing
to
that
of
britain
we
were
to
have
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
between
us
if
we
could
make
that
sum
out
of
the
profits
of
the
office
to
do
this
a
variety
of
improvements
were
necessary
some
of
these
were
inevitably
at
first
expensive
so
that
in
the
first
four
years
the
office
became
above
nine
hundred
pounds
in
debt
to
us
but
it
soon
after
began
to
repay
us
and
before
i
was
displac
by
a
freak
of
the
ministers
of
which
i
shall
speak
hereafter
we
had
brought
it
to
yield
three
times
as
much
clear
revenue
to
the
crown
as
the
postoffice
of
ireland
since
that
imprudent
transaction
they
have
receiv
from
it
not
one
farthing
the
business
of
the
postoffice
occasion
my
taking
a
journey
this
year
to
new
england
where
the
college
of
cambridge
of
their
own
motion
presented
me
with
the
degree
of
master
of
arts
yale
college
in
connecticut
had
before
made
me
a
similar
compliment
thus
without
studying
in
any
college
i
came
to
partake
of
their
honours
they
were
conferr
in
consideration
of
my
improvements
and
discoveries
in
the
electric
branch
of
natural
philosophy
in
war
with
france
being
again
apprehended
a
congress
of
commissioners
from
the
different
colonies
was
by
an
order
of
the
lords
of
trade
to
be
assembled
at
albany
there
to
confer
with
the
chiefs
of
the
six
nations
concerning
the
means
of
defending
both
their
country
and
ours
governor
hamilton
having
receiv
this
order
acquainted
the
house
with
it
requesting
they
would
furnish
proper
presents
for
the
indians
to
be
given
on
this
occasion
and
naming
the
speaker
norris
and
myself
to
join
thomas
penn
and
secretary
peters
as
commissioners
to
act
for
pennsylvania
the
house
approv
the
nomination
and
provided
the
goods
for
the
present
and
tho
they
did
not
much
like
treating
out
of
the
provinces
and
we
met
the
other
commissioners
at
albany
about
the
middle
of
june
in
our
way
thither
i
projected
and
drew
a
plan
for
the
union
of
all
the
colonies
under
one
government
so
far
as
might
be
necessary
for
defense
and
other
important
general
purposes
as
we
pass
thro
new
york
i
had
there
shown
my
project
to
james
alexander
and
kennedy
two
gentlemen
of
great
knowledge
in
public
affairs
and
being
fortified
by
their
approbation
i
ventur
to
lay
it
before
the
congress
it
then
appeared
that
several
of
the
commissioners
had
form
plans
of
the
same
kind
a
previous
question
was
first
taken
whether
a
union
should
be
established
which
pass
in
the
affirmative
unanimously
a
committee
was
then
appointed
one
member
from
each
colony
to
consider
the
several
plans
and
report
mine
happen
to
be
preferr
and
with
a
few
amendments
was
accordingly
reported
by
this
plan
the
general
government
was
to
be
administered
by
a
appointed
and
supported
by
the
crown
and
a
grand
council
was
to
be
chosen
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
several
colonies
met
in
their
respective
assemblies
the
debates
upon
it
in
congress
went
on
daily
hand
in
hand
with
the
indian
business
many
objections
and
difficulties
were
started
but
at
length
they
were
all
overcome
and
the
plan
was
unanimously
agreed
to
and
copies
ordered
to
be
transmitted
to
the
board
of
trade
and
to
the
assemblies
of
the
several
provinces
its
fate
was
singular
the
assemblies
did
not
adopt
it
as
they
all
thought
there
was
too
much
prerogative
in
it
and
in
england
it
was
judg
to
have
too
much
of
the
democratic
the
board
of
trade
therefore
did
not
approve
of
it
nor
recommend
it
for
the
approbation
of
his
majesty
but
another
scheme
was
form
supposed
to
answer
the
same
purpose
better
whereby
the
governors
of
the
provinces
with
some
members
of
their
respective
councils
were
to
meet
and
order
the
raising
of
troops
building
of
forts
and
to
draw
on
the
treasury
of
great
britain
for
the
expense
which
was
afterwards
to
be
refunded
by
an
act
of
parliament
laying
a
tax
on
america
my
plan
with
my
reasons
in
support
of
it
is
to
be
found
among
my
political
papers
that
are
printed
being
the
winter
following
in
boston
i
had
much
conversation
with
governor
shirley
upon
both
the
plans
part
of
what
passed
between
us
on
the
occasion
may
also
be
seen
among
those
papers
the
different
and
contrary
reasons
of
dislike
to
my
plan
makes
me
suspect
that
it
was
really
the
true
medium
and
i
am
still
of
opinion
it
would
have
been
happy
for
both
sides
the
water
if
it
had
been
adopted
the
colonies
so
united
would
have
been
sufficiently
strong
to
have
defended
themselves
there
would
then
have
been
no
need
of
troops
from
england
of
course
the
subsequent
pretence
for
taxing
america
and
the
bloody
contest
it
occasioned
would
have
been
avoided
but
such
mistakes
are
not
new
history
is
full
of
the
errors
of
states
and
princes
look
round
the
habitable
world
how
few
know
their
own
good
or
knowing
it
pursue
those
who
govern
having
much
business
on
their
hands
do
not
generally
like
to
take
the
trouble
of
considering
and
carrying
into
execution
new
projects
the
best
public
measures
are
therefore
seldom
adopted
from
previous
wisdom
but
forc
by
the
occasion
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
in
sending
it
down
to
the
assembly
express
his
approbation
of
the
plan
as
appearing
to
him
to
be
drawn
up
with
great
clearness
and
strength
of
judgment
and
therefore
recommended
it
as
well
worthy
of
their
closest
and
most
serious
attention
the
house
however
by
the
management
of
a
certain
member
took
it
up
when
i
happen
to
be
absent
which
i
thought
not
very
fair
and
reprobated
it
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
at
all
to
my
no
small
mortification
in
my
journey
to
boston
this
year
i
met
at
new
york
with
our
new
governor
morris
just
arriv
there
from
england
with
whom
i
had
been
before
intimately
acquainted
he
brought
a
commission
to
supersede
hamilton
who
tir
with
the
disputes
his
proprietary
instructions
subjected
him
to
had
resign
morris
ask
me
if
i
thought
he
must
expect
as
uncomfortable
an
administration
i
said
no
you
may
on
the
contrary
have
a
very
comfortable
one
if
you
will
only
take
care
not
to
enter
into
any
dispute
with
the
assembly
my
dear
friend
says
he
pleasantly
how
can
you
advise
my
avoiding
disputes
you
know
i
love
disputing
it
is
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures
however
to
show
the
regard
i
have
for
your
counsel
i
promise
you
i
will
if
possible
avoid
them
he
had
some
reason
for
loving
to
dispute
being
eloquent
an
acute
sophister
and
therefore
generally
successful
in
argumentative
conversation
he
had
been
brought
up
to
it
from
a
boy
his
father
as
i
have
heard
accustoming
his
children
to
dispute
with
one
another
for
his
diversion
while
sitting
at
table
after
dinner
but
i
think
the
practice
was
not
wise
for
in
the
course
of
my
observation
these
disputing
contradicting
and
confuting
people
are
generally
unfortunate
in
their
affairs
they
get
victory
sometimes
but
they
never
get
good
will
which
would
be
of
more
use
to
them
we
parted
he
going
to
philadelphia
and
i
to
boston
in
returning
i
met
at
new
york
with
the
votes
of
the
assembly
by
which
it
appear
that
notwithstanding
his
promise
to
me
he
and
the
house
were
already
in
high
contention
and
it
was
a
continual
battle
between
them
as
long
as
he
retain
the
government
i
had
my
share
of
it
for
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
my
seat
in
the
assembly
i
was
put
on
every
committee
for
answering
his
speeches
and
messages
and
by
the
committees
always
desired
to
make
the
drafts
our
answers
as
well
as
his
messages
were
often
tart
and
sometimes
indecently
abusive
and
as
he
knew
i
wrote
for
the
assembly
one
might
have
imagined
that
when
we
met
we
could
hardly
avoid
cutting
throats
but
he
was
so
a
man
that
no
personal
difference
between
him
and
me
was
occasion
by
the
contest
and
we
often
din
together
one
afternoon
in
the
height
of
this
public
quarrel
we
met
in
the
street
franklin
says
he
you
must
go
home
with
me
and
spend
the
evening
i
am
to
have
some
company
that
you
will
like
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
he
led
me
to
his
house
in
gay
conversation
over
our
wine
after
supper
he
told
us
jokingly
that
he
much
admir
the
idea
of
sancho
panza
who
when
it
was
proposed
to
give
him
a
government
requested
it
might
be
a
government
of
blacks
as
then
if
he
could
not
agree
with
his
people
he
might
sell
them
one
of
his
friends
who
sat
next
to
me
says
franklin
why
do
you
continue
to
side
with
these
damn
quakers
had
not
you
better
sell
them
the
proprietor
would
give
you
a
good
price
the
governor
says
i
has
not
yet
blacked
them
enough
he
indeed
had
labored
hard
to
blacken
the
assembly
in
all
his
messages
but
they
wip
off
his
coloring
as
fast
as
he
laid
it
on
and
plac
it
in
return
thick
upon
his
own
face
so
that
finding
he
was
likely
to
be
negrofied
himself
he
as
well
as
hamilton
grew
of
the
contest
and
quitted
the
government
these
public
quarrels
were
all
at
bottom
owing
to
the
proprietaries
our
hereditary
governors
who
when
any
expense
was
to
be
incurred
for
the
defense
of
their
province
with
incredible
meanness
instructed
their
deputies
to
pass
no
act
for
levying
the
necessary
taxes
unless
their
vast
estates
were
in
the
same
act
expressly
excused
and
they
had
even
taken
bonds
of
these
deputies
to
observe
such
instructions
the
assemblies
for
three
years
held
out
against
this
injustice
tho
constrained
to
bend
at
last
at
length
captain
denny
who
was
governor
morris
successor
ventured
to
disobey
those
instructions
how
that
was
brought
about
i
shall
show
hereafter
my
acts
in
morris
time
military
marg
note
but
i
am
got
forward
too
fast
with
my
story
there
are
still
some
transactions
to
be
mention
that
happened
during
the
administration
of
governor
morris
war
being
in
a
manner
commenced
with
france
the
government
of
massachusetts
bay
projected
an
attack
upon
crown
point
and
sent
quincy
to
pennsylvania
and
pownall
afterward
governor
pownall
to
new
york
to
solicit
assistance
as
i
was
in
the
assembly
knew
its
temper
and
was
quincy
countryman
he
appli
to
me
for
my
influence
and
assistance
i
dictated
his
address
to
them
which
was
well
receiv
they
voted
an
aid
of
ten
thousand
pounds
to
be
laid
out
in
provisions
but
the
governor
refusing
his
assent
to
their
bill
which
included
this
with
other
sums
granted
for
the
use
of
the
crown
unless
a
clause
were
inserted
exempting
the
proprietary
estate
from
bearing
any
part
of
the
tax
that
would
be
necessary
the
assembly
tho
very
desirous
of
making
their
grant
to
new
england
effectual
were
at
a
loss
how
to
accomplish
it
quincy
labored
hard
with
the
governor
to
obtain
his
assent
but
he
was
obstinate
i
then
suggested
a
method
of
doing
the
business
without
the
governor
by
orders
on
the
trustees
of
the
loan
office
which
by
law
the
assembly
had
the
right
of
drawing
there
was
indeed
little
or
no
money
at
that
time
in
the
office
and
therefore
i
propos
that
the
orders
should
be
payable
in
a
year
and
to
bear
an
interest
of
five
per
cent
with
these
orders
i
suppos
the
provisions
might
easily
be
purchas
the
assembly
with
very
little
hesitation
adopted
the
proposal
the
orders
were
immediately
printed
and
i
was
one
of
the
committee
directed
to
sign
and
dispose
of
them
the
fund
for
paying
them
was
the
interest
of
all
the
paper
currency
then
extant
in
the
province
upon
loan
together
with
the
revenue
arising
from
the
excise
which
being
known
to
be
more
than
sufficient
they
obtain
instant
credit
and
were
not
only
receiv
in
payment
for
the
provisions
but
many
money
people
who
had
cash
lying
by
them
vested
it
in
those
orders
which
they
found
advantageous
as
they
bore
interest
while
upon
hand
and
might
on
any
occasion
be
used
as
money
so
that
they
were
eagerly
all
bought
up
and
in
a
few
weeks
none
of
them
were
to
be
seen
thus
this
important
affair
was
by
my
means
compleated
my
quincy
return
thanks
to
the
assembly
in
a
handsome
memorial
went
home
highly
pleas
with
the
success
of
his
embassy
and
ever
after
bore
for
me
the
most
cordial
and
affectionate
friendship
the
british
government
not
chusing
to
permit
the
union
of
the
colonies
as
propos
at
albany
and
to
trust
that
union
with
their
defense
lest
they
should
thereby
grow
too
military
and
feel
their
own
strength
suspicions
and
jealousies
at
this
time
being
entertain
of
them
sent
over
general
braddock
with
two
regiments
of
regular
english
troops
for
that
purpose
he
landed
at
alexandria
in
virginia
and
thence
to
frederictown
in
maryland
where
he
halted
for
carriages
our
assembly
apprehending
from
some
information
that
he
had
conceived
violent
prejudices
against
them
as
averse
to
the
service
wish
me
to
wait
upon
him
not
as
from
them
but
as
under
the
guise
of
proposing
to
settle
with
him
the
mode
of
conducting
with
most
celerity
and
certainty
the
despatches
between
him
and
the
governors
of
the
several
provinces
with
whom
he
must
necessarily
have
continual
correspondence
and
of
which
they
propos
to
pay
the
expense
my
son
accompanied
me
on
this
journey
we
found
the
general
at
frederictown
waiting
impatiently
for
the
return
of
those
he
had
sent
thro
the
back
parts
of
maryland
and
virginia
to
collect
waggons
i
stayed
with
him
several
days
din
with
him
daily
and
had
full
opportunity
of
removing
all
his
prejudices
by
the
information
of
what
the
assembly
had
before
his
arrival
actually
done
and
were
still
willing
to
do
to
facilitate
his
operations
when
i
was
about
to
depart
the
returns
of
waggons
to
be
obtained
were
brought
in
by
which
it
appear
that
they
amounted
only
to
and
not
all
of
those
were
in
serviceable
condition
the
general
and
all
the
officers
were
surpris
declar
the
expedition
was
then
at
an
end
being
impossible
and
exclaim
against
the
ministers
for
ignorantly
landing
them
in
a
country
destitute
of
the
means
of
conveying
their
stores
baggage
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
waggons
being
necessary
i
happened
to
say
i
thought
it
was
a
pity
they
had
not
been
landed
rather
in
pennsylvania
as
in
that
country
almost
every
farmer
had
his
waggon
the
general
eagerly
laid
hold
of
my
words
and
said
then
you
sir
who
are
a
man
of
interest
there
can
probably
procure
them
for
us
and
i
beg
you
will
undertake
it
i
ask
what
terms
were
to
be
the
owners
of
the
waggons
and
i
was
desir
to
put
on
paper
the
terms
that
appeared
to
me
necessary
this
i
did
and
they
were
agreed
to
and
a
commission
and
instructions
accordingly
prepar
immediately
what
those
terms
were
will
appear
in
the
advertisement
i
publish
as
soon
as
i
arriv
at
lancaster
which
being
from
the
great
and
sudden
effect
it
produc
a
piece
of
some
curiosity
i
shall
insert
it
at
length
as
follows
advertisement
lancaster
april
whereas
one
hundred
and
fifty
waggons
with
four
horses
to
each
waggon
and
fifteen
hundred
saddle
or
pack
horses
are
wanted
for
the
service
of
his
majesty

his
excellency

having
been
pleased

my
son
william
franklin
is
empowered
to
enter
into
like
contracts
with
any
person
in
cumberland
county
b
franklin
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
counties
of
lancaster
york
and
cumberland
friends
and
countrymen
being
occasionally
at
the
camp
at
frederic
a
few
days
since
i
found
the
general
and
officers
extremely
exasperated
on
account
of
their
not
being
supplied
with
horses
and
carriages
which
had
been
expected
from
this
province
as
most
able
to
furnish
them
but
through
the
dissensions
between
our
governor
and
assembly
money
had
not
been
provided
nor
any
steps
taken
for
that
purpose
it
was
proposed
to
send
an
armed
force
immediately
into
these
counties
to
seize
as
many
of
the
best
carriages
and
horses
as
should
be
wanted
and
compel
as
many
persons
into
the
service
as
would
be
necessary
to
drive
and
take
care
of
them
i
apprehended
that
the
progress
of
british
soldiers
through
these
counties
on
such
an
occasion
especially
considering
the
temper
they
are
in
and
their
resentment
against
us
would
be
attended
with
many
and
great
inconveniences
to
the
inhabitants
and
therefore
more
willingly
took
the
trouble
of
trying
first
what
might
be
done
by
fair
and
equitable
means
the
people
of
these
back
counties
have
lately
complained
to
the
assembly
that
a
sufficient
currency
was
wanting
you
have
an
opportunity
of
receiving
and
dividing
among
you
a
very
considerable
sum
for
if
the
service
of
this
expedition
should
continue
as
it
is
more
than
probable
it
will
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
the
hire
of
these
waggons
and
horses
will
amount
to
upward
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
which
will
be
paid
you
in
silver
and
gold
of
the
king
money
the
service
will
be
light
and
easy
for
the
army
will
scarce
march
above
twelve
miles
per
day
and
the
waggons
and
as
they
carry
those
things
that
are
absolutely
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
the
army
must
march
with
the
army
and
no
faster
and
are
for
the
sake
always
placed
where
they
can
be
most
secure
whether
in
a
march
or
in
a
camp
if
you
are
really
as
i
believe
you
are
good
and
loyal
subjects
to
his
majesty
you
may
now
do
a
most
acceptable
service
and
make
it
easy
to
yourselves
for
three
or
four
of
such
as
can
not
separately
spare
from
the
business
of
their
plantations
a
waggon
and
four
horses
and
a
driver
may
do
it
together
one
furnishing
the
waggon
another
one
or
two
horses
and
another
the
driver
and
divide
the
pay
proportionately
between
you
but
if
you
do
not
this
service
to
your
king
and
country
voluntarily
when
such
good
pay
and
reasonable
terms
are
offered
to
you
your
loyalty
will
be
strongly
suspected
the
king
business
must
be
done
so
many
brave
troops
come
so
far
for
your
defense
must
not
stand
idle
through
your
backwardness
to
do
what
may
be
reasonably
expected
from
you
waggons
and
horses
must
be
had
violent
measures
will
probably
be
used
and
you
will
be
left
to
seek
for
a
recompense
where
you
can
find
it
and
your
case
perhaps
be
little
pitied
or
regarded
i
have
no
particular
interest
in
this
affair
as
except
the
satisfaction
of
endeavoring
to
do
good
i
shall
have
only
my
labour
for
my
pains
if
this
method
of
obtaining
the
waggons
and
horses
is
not
likely
to
succeed
i
am
obliged
to
send
word
to
the
general
in
fourteen
days
and
i
suppose
sir
john
clair
the
hussar
with
a
body
of
soldiers
will
immediately
enter
the
province
for
the
purpose
which
i
shall
be
sorry
to
hear
because
i
am
very
sincerely
and
truly
your
friend
and
b
franklin
i
received
of
the
general
about
eight
hundred
pounds
to
be
disbursed
in
to
the
waggon
owners
etc
but
that
sum
being
insufficient
i
advanc
upward
of
two
hundred
pounds
more
and
in
two
weeks
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
waggons
with
two
hundred
and
carrying
horses
were
on
their
march
for
the
camp
the
advertisement
promised
payment
according
to
the
valuation
in
case
any
waggon
or
horse
should
be
lost
the
owners
however
alleging
they
did
not
know
general
braddock
or
what
dependence
might
be
had
on
his
promise
insisted
on
my
bond
for
the
performance
which
i
accordingly
gave
them
while
i
was
at
the
camp
supping
one
evening
with
the
officers
of
colonel
dunbar
regiment
he
represented
to
me
his
concern
for
the
subalterns
who
he
said
were
generally
not
in
affluence
and
could
ill
afford
in
this
dear
country
to
lay
in
the
stores
that
might
be
necessary
in
so
long
a
march
thro
a
wilderness
where
nothing
was
to
be
purchas
i
commiserated
their
case
and
resolved
to
endeavor
procuring
them
some
relief
i
said
nothing
however
to
him
of
my
intention
but
wrote
the
next
morning
to
the
committee
of
the
assembly
who
had
the
disposition
of
some
public
money
warmly
recommending
the
case
of
these
officers
to
their
consideration
and
proposing
that
a
present
should
be
sent
them
of
necessaries
and
refreshments
my
son
who
had
some
experience
of
a
camp
life
and
of
its
wants
drew
up
a
list
for
me
which
i
enclos
in
my
letter
the
committee
approv
and
used
such
diligence
that
conducted
by
my
son
the
stores
arrived
at
the
camp
as
soon
as
the
waggons
they
consisted
of
twenty
parcels
each
containing
lbs
loaf
sugar
gloucester
cheese
lbs
good
muscovado
do
kegg
containing
lbs
good
butter
lb
good
green
tea
doz
old
madeira
wine

good
bohea
do
gallons
jamaica
spirits
lbs
good
ground

lbs
chocolate
hams
cwt
best
white
biscuit
dozen
dry
tongues
lb
pepper
lbs
rice
quart
best
white
wine
lbs
raisins
vinegar
these
twenty
parcels
well
pack
were
placed
on
as
many
horses
each
parcel
with
the
horse
being
intended
as
a
present
for
one
officer
they
were
very
thankfully
receiv
and
the
kindness
acknowledg
by
letters
to
me
from
the
colonels
of
both
regiments
in
the
most
grateful
terms
the
general
too
was
highly
satisfied
with
my
conduct
in
procuring
him
the
waggons
and
readily
paid
my
account
of
disbursements
thanking
me
repeatedly
and
requesting
my
farther
assistance
in
sending
provisions
after
him
i
undertook
this
also
and
was
busily
employ
in
it
till
we
heard
of
his
defeat
advancing
for
the
service
of
my
own
money
upwards
of
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
of
which
i
sent
him
an
account
it
came
to
his
hands
luckily
for
me
a
few
days
before
the
battle
and
he
return
me
immediately
an
order
on
the
paymaster
for
the
round
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
leaving
the
remainder
to
the
next
account
i
consider
this
payment
as
good
luck
having
never
been
able
to
obtain
that
remainder
of
which
more
hereafter
this
general
was
i
think
a
brave
man
and
might
probably
have
made
a
figure
as
a
good
officer
in
some
european
war
but
he
had
too
much
too
high
an
opinion
of
the
validity
of
regular
troops
and
too
mean
a
one
of
both
americans
and
indians
george
croghan
our
indian
interpreter
join
him
on
his
march
with
one
hundred
of
those
people
who
might
have
been
of
great
use
to
his
army
as
guides
scouts
if
he
had
treated
them
kindly
but
he
slighted
and
neglected
them
and
they
gradually
left
him
in
conversation
with
him
one
day
he
was
giving
me
some
account
of
his
intended
progress
after
taking
fort
duquesne
says
he
i
am
to
proceed
to
niagara
and
having
taken
that
to
frontenac
if
the
season
will
allow
time
and
i
suppose
it
will
for
duquesne
can
hardly
detain
me
above
three
or
four
days
and
then
i
see
nothing
that
can
obstruct
my
march
to
niagara
having
before
revolv
in
my
mind
the
long
line
his
army
must
make
in
their
march
by
a
very
narrow
road
to
be
cut
for
them
thro
the
woods
and
bushes
and
also
what
i
had
read
of
a
former
defeat
of
fifteen
hundred
french
who
invaded
the
iroquois
country
i
had
conceiv
some
doubts
and
some
fears
for
the
event
of
the
campaign
but
i
ventur
only
to
say
to
be
sure
sir
if
you
arrive
well
before
duquesne
with
these
fine
troops
so
well
provided
with
artillery
that
place
not
yet
compleatly
fortified
and
as
we
hear
with
no
very
strong
garrison
can
probably
make
but
a
short
resistance
the
only
danger
i
apprehend
of
obstruction
to
your
march
is
from
ambuscades
of
indians
who
by
constant
practice
are
dexterous
in
laying
and
executing
them
and
the
slender
line
near
four
miles
long
which
your
army
must
make
may
expose
it
to
be
attack
by
surprise
in
its
flanks
and
to
be
cut
like
a
thread
into
several
pieces
which
from
their
distance
can
not
come
up
in
time
to
support
each
other
he
smil
at
my
ignorance
and
reply
these
savages
may
indeed
be
a
formidable
enemy
to
your
raw
american
militia
but
upon
the
regular
and
disciplin
troops
sir
it
is
impossible
they
should
make
any
impression
i
was
conscious
of
an
impropriety
in
my
disputing
with
a
military
man
in
matters
of
his
profession
and
said
no
more
the
enemy
however
did
not
take
the
advantage
of
his
army
which
i
apprehended
its
long
line
of
march
expos
it
to
but
let
it
advance
without
interruption
till
within
nine
miles
of
the
place
and
then
when
more
in
a
body
for
it
had
just
passed
a
river
where
the
front
had
halted
till
all
were
come
over
and
in
a
more
open
part
of
the
woods
than
any
it
had
pass
attack
its
advanced
guard
by
a
heavy
fire
from
behind
trees
and
bushes
which
was
the
first
intelligence
the
general
had
of
an
enemy
being
near
him
this
guard
being
disordered
the
general
hurried
the
troops
up
to
their
assistance
which
was
done
in
great
confusion
thro
waggons
baggage
and
cattle
and
presently
the
fire
came
upon
their
flank
the
officers
being
on
horseback
were
more
easily
distinguish
pick
out
as
marks
and
fell
very
fast
and
the
soldiers
were
crowded
together
in
a
huddle
having
or
hearing
no
orders
and
standing
to
be
shot
at
till
of
them
were
killed
and
then
being
seiz
with
a
panick
the
whole
fled
with
precipitation
the
waggoners
took
each
a
horse
out
of
his
team
and
scamper
their
example
was
immediately
followed
by
others
so
that
all
the
waggons
provisions
artillery
and
stores
were
left
to
the
enemy
the
general
being
wounded
was
brought
off
with
difficulty
his
secretary
shirley
was
killed
by
his
side
and
out
of
officers
were
killed
or
wounded
and
seven
hundred
and
fourteen
men
killed
out
of
eleven
hundred
these
eleven
hundred
had
been
picked
men
from
the
whole
army
the
rest
had
been
left
behind
with
colonel
dunbar
who
was
to
follow
with
the
heavier
part
of
the
stores
provisions
and
baggage
the
flyers
not
being
pursu
arriv
at
dunbar
camp
and
the
panick
they
brought
with
them
instantly
seiz
him
and
all
his
people
and
tho
he
had
now
above
one
thousand
men
and
the
enemy
who
had
beaten
braddock
did
not
at
most
exceed
four
hundred
indians
and
french
together
instead
of
proceeding
and
endeavoring
to
recover
some
of
the
lost
honour
he
ordered
all
the
stores
ammunition
to
be
destroy
that
he
might
have
more
horses
to
assist
his
flight
towards
the
settlements
and
less
lumber
to
remove
he
was
there
met
with
requests
from
the
governors
of
virginia
maryland
and
pennsylvania
that
he
would
post
his
troops
on
the
frontiers
so
as
to
afford
some
protection
to
the
inhabitants
but
he
continu
his
hasty
march
all
the
country
not
thinking
himself
safe
till
he
arriv
at
philadelphia
where
the
inhabitants
could
protect
him
this
whole
transaction
gave
us
americans
the
first
suspicion
that
our
exalted
ideas
of
the
prowess
of
british
regulars
had
not
been
well
founded
in
their
first
march
too
from
their
landing
till
they
got
beyond
the
settlements
they
had
plundered
and
stripped
the
inhabitants
totally
ruining
some
poor
families
besides
insulting
abusing
and
confining
the
people
if
they
remonstrated
this
was
enough
to
put
us
out
of
conceit
of
such
defenders
if
we
had
really
wanted
any
how
different
was
the
conduct
of
our
french
friends
in
who
during
a
march
the
most
inhabited
part
of
our
country
from
rhode
island
to
virginia
near
seven
hundred
miles
occasioned
not
the
smallest
complaint
for
the
loss
of
a
pig
a
chicken
or
even
an
apple
captain
orme
who
was
one
of
the
general
and
being
grievously
wounded
was
brought
off
with
him
and
continu
with
him
to
his
death
which
happen
in
a
few
days
told
me
that
he
was
totally
silent
all
the
first
day
and
at
night
only
said
who
would
have
thought
it
that
he
was
silent
again
the
following
day
saying
only
at
last
we
shall
better
know
how
to
deal
with
them
another
time
and
dy
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
secretary
papers
with
all
the
general
orders
instructions
and
correspondence
falling
into
the
enemy
hands
they
selected
and
translated
into
french
a
number
of
the
articles
which
they
printed
to
prove
the
hostile
intentions
of
the
british
court
before
the
declaration
of
war
among
these
i
saw
some
letters
of
the
general
to
the
ministry
speaking
highly
of
the
great
service
i
had
rendered
the
army
and
recommending
me
to
their
notice
david
hume
too
who
was
some
years
after
secretary
to
lord
hertford
when
minister
in
france
and
afterward
to
general
conway
when
secretary
of
state
told
me
he
had
seen
among
the
papers
in
that
office
letters
from
braddock
highly
recommending
me
but
the
expedition
having
been
unfortunate
my
service
it
seems
was
not
thought
of
much
value
for
those
recommendations
were
never
of
any
use
to
me
as
to
rewards
from
himself
i
ask
only
one
which
was
that
he
would
give
orders
to
his
officers
not
to
enlist
any
more
of
our
bought
servants
and
that
he
would
discharge
such
as
had
been
already
enlisted
this
he
readily
granted
and
several
were
accordingly
return
to
their
masters
on
my
application
dunbar
when
the
command
devolv
on
him
was
not
so
generous
he
being
at
philadelphia
on
his
retreat
or
rather
flight
i
apply
to
him
for
the
discharge
of
the
servants
of
three
poor
farmers
of
lancaster
county
that
he
had
enlisted
reminding
him
of
the
late
general
orders
on
that
head
he
promised
me
that
if
the
masters
would
come
to
him
at
trenton
where
he
should
be
in
a
few
days
on
his
march
to
new
york
he
would
there
deliver
their
men
to
them
they
accordingly
were
at
the
expense
and
trouble
of
going
to
trenton
and
there
he
refus
to
perform
his
promise
to
their
great
loss
and
disappointment
as
soon
as
the
loss
of
the
waggons
and
horses
was
generally
known
all
the
owners
came
upon
me
for
the
valuation
which
i
had
given
bond
to
pay
their
demands
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
my
acquainting
them
that
the
money
was
ready
in
the
paymaster
hands
but
that
orders
for
paying
it
must
first
be
obtained
from
general
shirley
and
my
assuring
them
that
i
had
apply
to
that
general
by
letter
but
he
being
at
a
distance
an
answer
could
not
soon
be
receiv
and
they
must
have
patience
all
this
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
and
some
began
to
sue
me
general
shirley
at
length
relieved
me
from
this
terrible
situation
by
appointing
commissioners
to
examine
the
claims
and
ordering
payment
they
amounted
to
near
twenty
thousand
pound
which
to
pay
would
have
ruined
me
before
we
had
the
news
of
this
defeat
the
two
doctors
bond
came
to
me
with
a
subscription
paper
for
raising
money
to
defray
the
expense
of
a
grand
firework
which
it
was
intended
to
exhibit
at
a
rejoicing
on
receipt
of
the
news
of
our
taking
fort
duquesne
i
looked
grave
and
said
it
would
i
thought
be
time
enough
to
prepare
for
the
rejoicing
when
we
knew
we
should
have
occasion
to
rejoice
they
seem
that
i
did
not
immediately
comply
with
their
proposal
why
the
d
l
says
one
of
them
you
surely
do
suppose
that
the
fort
will
not
be
taken
i
do
know
that
it
will
not
be
taken
but
i
know
that
the
events
of
war
are
subject
to
great
uncertainty
i
gave
them
the
reasons
of
my
doubting
the
subscription
was
dropt
and
the
projectors
thereby
missed
the
mortification
they
would
have
undergone
if
the
firework
had
been
prepared
dr
bond
on
some
other
occasion
afterward
said
that
he
did
not
like
franklin
forebodings
governor
morris
who
had
continually
worried
the
assembly
with
message
after
message
before
the
defeat
of
braddock
to
beat
them
into
the
making
of
acts
to
raise
money
for
the
defense
of
the
province
without
taxing
among
others
the
proprietary
estates
and
had
rejected
all
their
bills
for
not
having
such
an
exempting
clause
now
redoubled
his
attacks
with
more
hope
of
success
the
danger
and
necessity
being
greater
the
assembly
however
continu
firm
believing
they
had
justice
on
their
side
and
that
it
would
be
giving
up
an
essential
right
if
they
suffered
the
governor
to
amend
their
in
one
of
the
last
indeed
which
was
for
granting
fifty
thousand
pounds
his
amendment
was
only
of
a
single
word
the
bill
expressed
that
all
estates
real
and
personal
were
to
be
taxed
those
of
the
proprietaries
not
excepted
his
amendment
was
for
not
read
only
a
small
but
very
material
alteration
however
when
the
news
of
this
disaster
reached
england
our
friends
there
whom
we
had
taken
care
to
furnish
with
all
the
assembly
answers
to
the
governor
messages
rais
a
clamor
against
the
proprietaries
for
their
meanness
and
injustice
in
giving
their
governor
such
instructions
some
going
so
far
as
to
say
that
by
obstructing
the
defense
of
their
province
they
forfeited
their
right
to
it
they
were
intimidated
by
this
and
sent
orders
to
their
to
add
five
thousand
pounds
of
their
money
to
whatever
sum
might
be
given
by
the
assembly
for
such
purpose
this
being
notified
to
the
house
was
accepted
in
lieu
of
their
share
of
a
general
tax
and
a
new
bill
was
form
with
an
exempting
clause
which
passed
accordingly
by
this
act
i
was
appointed
one
of
the
commissioners
for
disposing
of
the
money
sixty
thousand
pounds
i
had
been
active
in
modelling
the
bill
and
procuring
its
passage
and
had
at
the
same
time
drawn
a
bill
for
establishing
and
disciplining
of
a
voluntary
militia
which
i
carried
thro
the
house
without
much
difficulty
as
care
was
taken
in
it
to
leave
the
quakers
at
their
liberty
to
promote
the
association
necessary
to
form
the
militia
i
wrote
a
dialogue
stating
and
answering
all
the
objections
i
could
think
of
to
such
a
militia
which
was
printed
and
had
as
i
thought
great
effect
this
dialogue
and
the
militia
act
are
in
the
gentleman
magazine
for
february
and
march
marg
note
while
the
several
companies
in
the
city
and
country
were
forming
and
learning
their
exercise
the
governor
prevail
with
me
to
take
charge
of
our
frontier
which
was
infested
by
the
enemy
and
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
inhabitants
by
raising
troops
and
building
a
line
of
forts
i
undertook
this
military
business
tho
i
did
not
conceive
myself
well
qualified
for
it
he
gave
me
a
commission
with
full
powers
and
a
parcel
of
blank
commissions
for
officers
to
be
given
to
whom
i
thought
fit
i
had
but
little
difficulty
in
raising
men
having
soon
five
hundred
and
sixty
under
my
command
my
son
who
had
in
the
preceding
war
been
an
officer
in
the
army
rais
against
canada
was
my
and
of
great
use
to
me
the
indians
had
burned
gnadenhut
a
village
settled
by
the
moravians
and
massacred
the
inhabitants
but
the
place
was
thought
a
good
situation
for
one
of
the
forts
in
order
to
march
thither
i
assembled
the
companies
at
bethlehem
the
chief
establishment
of
those
people
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
in
so
good
a
posture
of
defense
the
destruction
of
gnadenhut
had
made
them
apprehend
danger
the
principal
buildings
were
defended
by
a
stockade
they
had
purchased
a
quantity
of
arms
and
ammunition
from
new
york
and
had
even
plac
quantities
of
small
paving
stones
between
the
windows
of
their
high
stone
houses
for
their
women
to
throw
down
upon
the
heads
of
any
indians
that
should
attempt
to
force
into
them
the
armed
brethren
too
kept
watch
and
reliev
as
methodically
as
in
any
garrison
town
in
conversation
with
the
bishop
spangenberg
i
mention
this
my
surprise
for
knowing
they
had
obtained
an
act
of
parliament
exempting
them
from
military
duties
in
the
colonies
i
had
suppos
they
were
conscientiously
scrupulous
of
bearing
arms
he
answer
me
that
it
was
not
one
of
their
established
principles
but
that
at
the
time
of
their
obtaining
that
act
it
was
thought
to
be
a
principle
with
many
of
their
people
on
this
occasion
however
they
to
their
surprise
found
it
adopted
by
but
a
few
it
seems
they
were
either
deceiv
in
themselves
or
deceiv
the
parliament
but
common
sense
aided
by
present
danger
will
sometimes
be
too
strong
for
whimsical
opinions
it
was
the
beginning
of
january
when
we
set
out
upon
this
business
of
building
forts
i
sent
one
detachment
toward
the
minisink
with
instructions
to
erect
one
for
the
security
of
that
upper
part
of
the
country
and
another
to
the
lower
part
with
similar
instructions
and
i
concluded
to
go
myself
with
the
rest
of
my
force
to
gnadenhut
where
a
fort
was
more
immediately
necessary
the
moravians
procur
me
five
waggons
for
our
tools
stores
baggage
etc
just
before
we
left
bethlehem
eleven
farmers
who
had
been
driven
from
their
plantations
by
the
indians
came
to
me
requesting
a
supply
of
firearms
that
they
might
go
back
and
fetch
off
their
cattle
i
gave
them
each
a
gun
with
suitable
ammunition
we
had
not
march
many
miles
before
it
began
to
rain
and
it
continued
raining
all
day
there
were
no
habitations
on
the
road
to
shelter
us
till
we
arriv
near
night
at
the
house
of
a
german
where
and
in
his
barn
we
were
all
huddled
together
as
wet
as
water
could
make
us
it
was
well
we
were
not
attack
in
our
march
for
our
arms
were
of
the
most
ordinary
sort
and
our
men
could
not
keep
their
gun
locks
dry
the
indians
are
dextrous
in
contrivances
for
that
purpose
which
we
had
not
they
met
that
day
the
eleven
poor
farmers
above
mentioned
and
killed
ten
of
them
the
one
who
inform
that
his
and
his
companions
guns
would
not
go
off
the
priming
being
wet
with
the
rain
the
next
day
being
fair
we
continu
our
march
and
arriv
at
the
desolated
gnadenhut
there
was
a
near
round
which
were
left
several
piles
of
boards
with
which
we
soon
hutted
ourselves
an
operation
the
more
necessary
at
that
inclement
season
as
we
had
no
tents
our
first
work
was
to
bury
more
effectually
the
dead
we
found
there
who
had
been
half
interr
by
the
country
people
the
next
morning
our
fort
was
plann
and
mark
out
the
circumference
measuring
four
hundred
and
feet
which
would
require
as
many
palisades
to
be
made
of
trees
one
with
another
of
a
foot
diameter
each
our
axes
of
which
we
had
seventy
were
immediately
set
to
work
to
cut
down
trees
and
our
men
being
dextrous
in
the
use
of
them
great
despatch
was
made
seeing
the
trees
fall
so
fast
i
had
the
curiosity
to
look
at
my
watch
when
two
men
began
to
cut
at
a
pine
in
six
minutes
they
had
it
upon
the
ground
and
i
found
it
of
fourteen
inches
diameter
each
pine
made
three
palisades
of
eighteen
feet
long
pointed
at
one
end
while
these
were
preparing
our
other
men
dug
a
trench
all
round
of
three
feet
deep
in
which
the
palisades
were
to
be
planted
and
our
waggons
the
bodys
being
taken
off
and
the
fore
and
hind
wheels
separated
by
taking
out
the
pin
which
united
the
two
parts
of
the
perch
we
had
ten
carriages
with
two
horses
each
to
bring
the
palisades
from
the
woods
to
the
spot
when
they
were
set
up
our
carpenters
built
a
stage
of
boards
all
round
within
about
six
feet
high
for
the
men
to
stand
on
when
to
fire
thro
the
loopholes
we
had
one
swivel
gun
which
we
mounted
on
one
of
the
angles
and
fir
it
as
soon
as
fix
to
let
the
indians
know
if
any
were
within
hearing
that
we
had
such
pieces
and
thus
our
fort
if
such
a
magnificent
name
may
be
given
to
so
miserable
a
stockade
was
finish
in
a
week
though
it
rain
so
hard
every
other
day
that
the
men
could
not
work
this
gave
me
occasion
to
observe
that
when
men
are
employ
they
are
best
content
for
on
the
days
they
worked
they
were
and
cheerful
and
with
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
good
day
work
they
spent
the
evening
jollily
but
on
our
idle
days
they
were
mutinous
and
quarrelsome
finding
fault
with
their
pork
the
bread
and
in
continual
which
put
me
in
mind
of
a
whose
rule
it
was
to
keep
his
men
constantly
at
work
and
when
his
mate
once
told
him
that
they
had
done
every
thing
and
there
was
nothing
further
to
employ
them
about
oh
says
he
make
them
scour
the
anchor
this
kind
of
fort
however
contemptible
is
a
sufficient
defense
against
indians
who
have
no
cannon
finding
ourselves
now
posted
securely
and
having
a
place
to
retreat
to
on
occasion
we
ventur
out
in
parties
to
scour
the
adjacent
country
we
met
with
no
indians
but
we
found
the
places
on
the
neighboring
hills
where
they
had
lain
to
watch
our
proceedings
there
was
an
art
in
their
contrivance
of
those
places
that
seems
worth
mention
it
being
winter
a
fire
was
necessary
for
them
but
a
common
fire
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
would
by
its
light
have
discovered
their
position
at
a
distance
they
had
therefore
dug
holes
in
the
ground
about
three
feet
diameter
and
somewhat
deeper
we
saw
where
they
had
with
their
hatchets
cut
off
the
charcoal
from
the
sides
of
burnt
logs
lying
in
the
woods
with
these
coals
they
had
made
small
fires
in
the
bottom
of
the
holes
and
we
observ
among
the
weeds
and
grass
the
prints
of
their
bodies
made
by
their
laying
all
round
with
their
legs
hanging
down
in
the
holes
to
keep
their
feet
warm
which
with
them
is
an
essential
point
this
kind
of
fire
so
manag
could
not
discover
them
either
by
its
light
flame
sparks
or
even
smoke
it
appear
that
their
number
was
not
great
and
it
seems
they
saw
we
were
too
many
to
be
attacked
by
them
with
prospect
of
advantage
we
had
for
our
chaplain
a
zealous
presbyterian
minister
beatty
who
complained
to
me
that
the
men
did
not
generally
attend
his
prayers
and
exhortations
when
they
enlisted
they
were
promised
besides
pay
and
provisions
a
gill
of
rum
a
day
which
was
punctually
serv
out
to
them
half
in
the
morning
and
the
other
half
in
the
evening
and
i
observ
they
were
as
punctual
in
attending
to
receive
it
upon
which
i
said
to
beatty
it
is
perhaps
below
the
dignity
of
your
profession
to
act
as
steward
of
the
rum
but
if
you
were
to
deal
it
out
and
only
just
after
prayers
you
would
have
them
all
about
you
he
liked
the
undertook
the
office
and
with
the
help
of
a
few
hands
to
measure
out
the
liquor
executed
it
to
satisfaction
and
never
were
prayers
more
generally
and
more
punctually
attended
so
that
i
thought
this
method
preferable
to
the
punishment
inflicted
by
some
military
laws
for
on
divine
service
i
had
hardly
finish
this
business
and
got
my
fort
well
stor
with
provisions
when
i
receiv
a
letter
from
the
governor
acquainting
me
that
he
had
call
the
assembly
and
wished
my
attendance
there
if
the
posture
of
affairs
on
the
frontiers
was
such
that
my
remaining
there
was
no
longer
necessary
my
friends
too
of
the
assembly
pressing
me
by
their
letters
to
be
if
possible
at
the
meeting
and
my
three
intended
forts
being
now
compleated
and
the
inhabitants
contented
to
remain
on
their
farms
under
that
protection
i
resolved
to
return
the
more
willingly
as
a
new
england
officer
colonel
clapham
experienced
in
indian
war
being
on
a
visit
to
our
establishment
consented
to
accept
the
command
i
gave
him
a
commission
and
parading
the
garrison
had
it
read
before
them
and
introduc
him
to
them
as
an
officer
who
from
his
skill
in
military
affairs
was
much
more
fit
to
command
them
than
myself
and
giving
them
a
little
exhortation
took
my
leave
i
was
escorted
as
far
as
bethlehem
where
i
rested
a
few
days
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
i
had
undergone
the
first
night
being
in
a
good
bed
i
could
hardly
sleep
it
was
so
different
from
my
hard
lodging
on
the
floor
of
our
hut
at
gnaden
wrapt
only
in
a
blanket
or
two
while
at
bethlehem
i
inquir
a
little
into
the
practice
of
the
moravians
some
of
them
had
accompanied
me
and
all
were
very
kind
to
me
i
found
they
work
for
a
common
stock
eat
at
common
tables
and
slept
in
common
dormitories
great
numbers
together
in
the
dormitories
i
observed
loopholes
at
certain
distances
all
along
just
under
the
ceiling
which
i
thought
judiciously
placed
for
change
of
air
i
was
at
their
church
where
i
was
entertain
with
good
musick
the
organ
being
accompanied
with
violins
hautboys
flutes
clarinets
etc
i
understood
that
their
sermons
were
not
usually
preached
to
mixed
congregations
of
men
women
and
children
as
is
our
common
practice
but
that
they
assembled
sometimes
the
married
men
at
other
times
their
wives
then
the
young
men
the
young
women
and
the
little
children
each
division
by
itself
the
sermon
i
heard
was
to
the
latter
who
came
in
and
were
plac
in
rows
on
benches
the
boys
under
the
conduct
of
a
young
man
their
tutor
and
the
girls
conducted
by
a
young
woman
the
discourse
seem
well
adapted
to
their
capacities
and
was
deliver
in
a
pleasing
familiar
manner
coaxing
them
as
it
were
to
be
good
they
behav
very
orderly
but
looked
pale
and
unhealthy
which
made
me
suspect
they
were
kept
too
much
within
doors
or
not
allow
sufficient
exercise
i
inquir
concerning
the
moravian
marriages
whether
the
report
was
true
that
they
were
by
lot
i
was
told
that
lots
were
us
only
in
particular
cases
that
generally
when
a
young
man
found
himself
dispos
to
marry
he
inform
the
elders
of
his
class
who
consulted
the
elder
ladies
that
govern
the
young
women
as
these
elders
of
the
different
sexes
were
well
acquainted
with
the
tempers
and
dispositions
of
their
respective
pupils
they
could
best
judge
what
matches
were
suitable
and
their
judgments
were
generally
acquiesc
in
but
if
for
example
it
should
happen
that
two
or
three
young
women
were
found
to
be
equally
proper
for
the
young
man
the
lot
was
then
recurred
to
i
objected
if
the
matches
are
not
made
by
the
mutual
choice
of
the
parties
some
of
them
may
chance
to
be
very
unhappy
and
so
they
may
answer
my
informer
if
you
let
the
parties
chuse
for
themselves
which
indeed
i
could
not
deny
being
returned
to
philadelphia
i
found
the
association
went
on
swimmingly
the
inhabitants
that
were
not
quakers
having
pretty
generally
come
into
it
formed
themselves
into
companies
and
chose
their
captains
lieutenants
and
ensigns
according
to
the
new
law
visited
me
and
gave
me
an
account
of
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
spread
a
general
good
liking
to
the
law
and
ascribed
much
to
those
endeavors
i
had
had
the
vanity
to
ascribe
all
to
my
dialogue
however
not
knowing
but
that
he
might
be
in
the
right
i
let
him
enjoy
his
opinion
which
i
take
to
be
generally
the
best
way
in
such
cases
the
officers
meeting
chose
me
to
be
colonel
of
the
regiment
which
i
this
time
accepted
i
forget
how
many
companies
we
had
but
we
paraded
about
twelve
hundred
men
with
a
company
of
artillery
who
had
been
furnished
with
six
brass
which
they
had
become
so
expert
in
the
use
of
as
to
fire
twelve
times
in
a
minute
the
first
time
i
reviewed
my
regiment
they
accompanied
me
to
my
house
and
would
salute
me
with
some
rounds
fired
before
my
door
which
shook
down
and
broke
several
glasses
of
my
electrical
apparatus
and
my
new
honour
proved
not
much
less
brittle
for
all
our
commissions
were
soon
after
broken
by
a
repeal
of
the
law
in
england
during
this
short
time
of
my
colonelship
being
about
to
set
out
on
a
journey
to
virginia
the
officers
of
my
regiment
took
it
into
their
heads
that
it
would
be
proper
for
them
to
escort
me
out
of
town
as
far
as
the
lower
ferry
just
as
i
was
getting
on
horseback
they
came
to
my
door
between
thirty
and
forty
mounted
and
all
in
their
uniforms
i
had
not
been
previously
acquainted
with
the
project
or
i
should
have
prevented
it
being
naturally
averse
to
the
assuming
of
state
on
any
occasion
and
i
was
a
good
deal
chagrin
at
their
appearance
as
i
could
not
avoid
their
accompanying
me
what
made
it
worse
was
that
as
soon
as
we
began
to
move
they
drew
their
swords
and
rode
with
them
naked
all
the
way
somebody
wrote
an
account
of
this
to
the
proprietor
and
it
gave
him
great
offense
no
such
honor
had
been
paid
him
when
in
the
province
nor
to
any
of
his
governors
and
he
said
it
was
only
proper
to
princes
of
the
blood
royal
which
may
be
true
for
aught
i
know
who
was
and
still
am
ignorant
of
the
etiquette
in
such
cases
this
silly
affair
however
greatly
increased
his
rancour
against
me
which
was
before
not
a
little
on
account
of
my
conduct
in
the
assembly
respecting
the
exemption
of
his
estate
from
taxation
which
i
had
always
oppos
very
warmly
and
not
without
severe
reflections
on
his
meanness
and
injustice
of
contending
for
it
he
accused
me
to
the
ministry
as
being
the
great
obstacle
to
the
king
service
preventing
by
my
influence
in
the
house
the
proper
form
of
the
bills
for
raising
money
and
he
instanced
this
parade
with
my
officers
as
a
proof
of
my
having
an
intention
to
take
the
government
of
the
province
out
of
his
hands
by
force
he
also
applied
to
sir
everard
fawkener
the
to
deprive
me
of
my
office
but
it
had
no
other
effect
than
to
procure
from
sir
everard
a
gentle
admonition
notwithstanding
the
continual
wrangle
between
the
governor
and
the
house
in
which
i
as
a
member
had
so
large
a
share
there
still
subsisted
a
civil
intercourse
between
that
gentleman
and
myself
and
we
never
had
any
personal
difference
i
have
sometimes
since
thought
that
his
little
or
no
resentment
against
me
for
the
answers
it
was
known
i
drew
up
to
his
messages
might
be
the
effect
of
professional
habit
and
that
being
bred
a
lawyer
he
might
consider
us
both
as
merely
advocates
for
contending
clients
in
a
suit
he
for
the
proprietaries
and
i
for
the
assembly
he
would
therefore
sometimes
call
in
a
friendly
way
to
advise
with
me
on
difficult
points
and
sometimes
tho
not
often
take
my
advice
we
acted
in
concert
to
supply
braddock
army
with
provisions
and
when
the
shocking
news
arrived
of
his
defeat
the
governor
sent
in
haste
for
me
to
consult
with
him
on
measures
for
preventing
the
desertion
of
the
back
counties
i
forget
now
the
advice
i
gave
but
i
think
it
was
that
dunbar
should
be
written
to
and
prevail
with
if
possible
to
post
his
troops
on
the
frontiers
for
their
protection
till
by
from
the
colonies
he
might
be
able
to
proceed
on
the
expedition
and
after
my
return
from
the
frontier
he
would
have
had
me
undertake
the
conduct
of
such
an
expedition
with
provincial
troops
for
the
reduction
of
fort
duquesne
dunbar
and
his
men
being
otherwise
employed
and
he
proposed
to
commission
me
as
general
i
had
not
so
good
an
opinion
of
my
military
abilities
as
he
profess
to
have
and
i
believe
his
professions
must
have
exceeded
his
real
sentiments
but
probably
he
might
think
that
my
popularity
would
facilitate
the
raising
of
the
men
and
my
influence
in
assembly
the
grant
of
money
to
pay
them
and
that
perhaps
without
taxing
the
proprietary
estate
finding
me
not
so
forward
to
engage
as
he
expected
the
project
was
dropt
and
he
soon
after
left
the
government
being
superseded
by
captain
denny
before
i
proceed
in
relating
the
part
i
had
in
public
affairs
under
this
new
governor
administration
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
give
some
account
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
my
philosophical
reputation
in
being
at
boston
i
met
there
with
a
spence
who
was
lately
arrived
from
scotland
and
show
me
some
electric
experiments
they
were
imperfectly
perform
as
he
was
not
very
expert
but
being
on
a
subject
quite
new
to
me
they
equally
surpris
and
pleased
me
soon
after
my
return
to
philadelphia
our
library
company
receiv
from
collinson
fellow
of
the
royal
society
of
london
a
present
of
a
glass
tube
with
some
account
of
the
use
of
it
in
making
such
experiments
i
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
of
repeating
what
i
had
seen
at
boston
and
by
much
practice
acquir
great
readiness
in
performing
those
also
which
we
had
an
account
of
from
england
adding
a
number
of
new
ones
i
say
much
practice
for
my
house
was
continually
full
for
some
time
with
people
who
came
to
see
these
new
wonders
to
divide
a
little
this
incumbrance
among
my
friends
i
caused
a
number
of
similar
tubes
to
be
blown
at
our
with
which
they
furnish
themselves
so
that
we
had
at
length
several
performers
among
these
the
principal
was
kinnersley
an
ingenious
neighbor
who
being
out
of
business
i
encouraged
to
undertake
showing
the
experiments
for
money
and
drew
up
for
him
two
lectures
in
which
the
experiments
were
rang
in
such
order
and
accompanied
with
such
explanations
in
such
method
as
that
the
foregoing
should
assist
in
comprehending
the
following
he
procur
an
elegant
apparatus
for
the
purpose
in
which
all
the
little
machines
that
i
had
roughly
made
for
myself
were
nicely
form
by
his
lectures
were
well
attended
and
gave
great
satisfaction
and
after
some
time
he
went
thro
the
colonies
exhibiting
them
in
every
capital
town
and
pick
up
some
money
in
the
west
india
islands
indeed
it
was
with
difficulty
the
experiments
could
be
made
from
the
general
moisture
of
the
air
oblig
as
we
were
to
collinson
for
his
present
of
the
tube
i
thought
it
right
he
should
be
inform
of
our
success
in
using
it
and
wrote
him
several
letters
containing
accounts
of
our
experiments
he
got
them
read
in
the
royal
society
where
they
were
not
at
first
thought
worth
so
much
notice
as
to
be
printed
in
their
transactions
one
paper
which
i
wrote
for
kinnersley
on
the
sameness
of
lightning
with
electricity
i
sent
to
mitchel
an
acquaintance
of
mine
and
one
of
the
members
also
of
that
society
who
wrote
me
word
that
it
had
been
read
but
was
laughed
at
by
the
connoisseurs
the
papers
however
being
shown
to
fothergill
he
thought
them
of
too
much
value
to
be
stifled
and
advis
the
printing
of
them
collinson
then
gave
them
to
cave
for
publication
in
his
gentleman
magazine
but
he
chose
to
print
them
separately
in
a
pamphlet
and
fothergill
wrote
the
preface
cave
it
seems
judged
rightly
for
his
profit
for
by
the
additions
that
arrived
after
they
swell
to
a
quarto
volume
which
has
had
five
editions
and
cost
him
nothing
for
it
was
however
some
time
before
those
papers
were
much
taken
notice
of
in
england
a
copy
of
them
happening
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
count
de
buffon
a
philosopher
deservedly
of
great
reputation
in
france
and
indeed
all
over
europe
he
prevailed
with
dalibard
to
translate
them
into
french
and
they
were
printed
at
paris
the
publication
offended
the
abbé
nollet
preceptor
in
natural
philosophy
to
the
royal
family
and
an
able
experimenter
who
had
form
and
publish
a
theory
of
electricity
which
then
had
the
general
vogue
he
could
not
at
first
believe
that
such
a
work
came
from
america
and
said
it
must
have
been
fabricated
by
his
enemies
at
paris
to
decry
his
system
afterwards
having
been
assur
that
there
really
existed
such
a
person
as
franklin
at
philadelphia
which
he
had
doubted
he
wrote
and
published
a
volume
of
letters
chiefly
address
to
me
defending
his
theory
and
denying
the
verity
of
my
experiments
and
of
the
positions
deduc
from
them
i
once
purpos
answering
the
abbé
and
actually
began
the
answer
but
on
consideration
that
my
writings
contain
a
description
of
experiments
which
any
one
might
repeat
and
verify
and
if
not
to
be
verifi
could
not
be
defended
or
of
observations
offer
as
conjectures
and
not
delivered
dogmatically
therefore
not
laying
me
under
any
obligation
to
defend
them
and
reflecting
that
a
dispute
between
two
persons
writing
in
different
languages
might
be
lengthened
greatly
by
mistranslations
and
thence
misconceptions
of
one
another
meaning
much
of
one
of
the
abbé
letters
being
founded
on
an
error
in
the
translation
i
concluded
to
let
my
papers
shift
for
themselves
believing
it
was
better
to
spend
what
time
i
could
spare
from
public
business
in
making
new
experiments
than
in
disputing
about
those
already
made
i
therefore
never
answered
nollet
and
the
event
gave
me
no
cause
to
repent
my
silence
for
my
friend
le
roy
of
the
royal
academy
of
sciences
took
up
my
cause
and
refuted
him
my
book
was
translated
into
the
italian
german
and
latin
languages
and
the
doctrine
it
contain
was
by
degrees
universally
adopted
by
the
philosophers
of
europe
in
preference
to
that
of
the
abbé
so
that
he
lived
to
see
himself
the
last
of
his
sect
except
monsieur
b
of
paris
his
élève
and
immediate
disciple
what
gave
my
book
the
more
sudden
and
general
celebrity
was
the
success
of
one
of
its
proposed
experiments
made
by
dalibard
and
de
lor
at
marly
for
drawing
lightning
from
the
clouds
this
engag
the
public
attention
every
where
de
lor
who
had
an
apparatus
for
experimental
philosophy
and
lectur
in
that
branch
of
science
undertook
to
repeat
what
he
called
the
philadelphia
experiments
and
after
they
were
performed
before
the
king
and
court
all
the
curious
of
paris
flocked
to
see
them
i
will
not
swell
this
narrative
with
an
account
of
that
capital
experiment
nor
of
the
infinite
pleasure
i
receiv
in
the
success
of
a
similar
one
i
made
soon
after
with
a
kite
at
philadelphia
as
both
are
to
be
found
in
the
histories
of
electricity
wright
an
english
physician
when
at
paris
wrote
to
a
friend
who
was
of
the
royal
society
an
account
of
the
high
esteem
my
experiments
were
in
among
the
learned
abroad
and
of
their
wonder
that
my
writings
had
been
so
little
noticed
in
england
the
society
on
this
resum
the
consideration
of
the
letters
that
had
been
read
to
them
and
the
celebrated
watson
drew
up
a
summary
account
of
them
and
of
all
i
had
afterwards
sent
to
england
on
the
subject
which
he
accompanied
with
some
praise
of
the
writer
this
summary
was
then
printed
in
their
transactions
and
some
members
of
the
society
in
london
particularly
the
very
ingenious
canton
having
verified
the
experiment
of
procuring
lightning
from
the
clouds
by
a
pointed
rod
and
acquainting
them
with
the
success
they
soon
made
me
more
than
amends
for
the
slight
with
which
they
had
before
treated
me
without
my
having
made
any
application
for
that
honor
they
chose
me
a
member
and
voted
that
i
should
be
excus
the
customary
payments
which
would
have
amounted
to
guineas
and
ever
since
have
given
me
their
transactions
gratis
they
also
presented
me
with
the
gold
medal
of
sir
godfrey
copley
for
the
year
the
delivery
of
which
was
accompanied
by
a
very
handsome
speech
of
the
president
lord
macclesfield
wherein
i
was
highly
honoured
our
new
governor
captain
denny
brought
over
for
me
the
medal
from
the
royal
society
which
he
presented
to
me
at
an
entertainment
given
him
by
the
city
he
accompanied
it
with
very
polite
expressions
of
his
esteem
for
me
having
as
he
said
been
long
acquainted
with
my
character
after
dinner
when
the
company
as
was
customary
at
that
time
were
engag
in
drinking
he
took
me
aside
into
another
room
and
acquainted
me
that
he
had
been
advis
by
his
friends
in
england
to
cultivate
a
friendship
with
me
as
one
who
was
capable
of
giving
him
the
best
advice
and
of
contributing
most
effectually
to
the
making
his
administration
easy
that
he
therefore
desired
of
all
things
to
have
a
good
understanding
with
me
and
he
begg
me
to
be
assur
of
his
readiness
on
all
occasions
to
render
me
every
service
that
might
be
in
his
power
he
said
much
to
me
also
of
the
proprietor
good
disposition
towards
the
province
and
of
the
advantage
it
might
be
to
us
all
and
to
me
in
particular
if
the
opposition
that
had
been
so
long
continu
to
his
measures
was
dropt
and
harmony
restor
between
him
and
the
people
in
effecting
which
it
was
thought
no
one
could
be
more
serviceable
than
myself
and
i
might
depend
on
adequate
acknowledgments
and
recompenses
etc
the
drinkers
finding
we
did
not
return
immediately
to
the
table
sent
us
a
decanter
of
madeira
which
the
governor
made
liberal
use
of
and
in
proportion
became
more
profuse
of
his
solicitations
and
promises
my
answers
were
to
this
purpose
that
my
circumstances
thanks
to
god
were
such
as
to
make
proprietary
favours
unnecessary
to
me
and
that
being
a
member
of
the
assembly
i
could
not
possibly
accept
of
any
that
however
i
had
no
personal
enmity
to
the
proprietary
and
that
whenever
the
public
measures
he
propos
should
appear
to
be
for
the
good
of
the
people
no
one
should
espouse
and
forward
them
more
zealously
than
myself
my
past
opposition
having
been
founded
on
this
that
the
measures
which
had
been
urged
were
evidently
intended
to
serve
the
proprietary
interest
with
great
prejudice
to
that
of
the
people
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
the
governor
for
his
professions
of
regard
to
me
and
that
he
might
rely
on
every
thing
in
my
power
to
make
his
administration
as
easy
as
possible
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
not
brought
with
him
the
same
unfortunate
instruction
his
predecessor
had
been
hamper
with
on
this
he
did
not
then
explain
himself
but
when
he
afterwards
came
to
do
business
with
the
assembly
they
appear
again
the
disputes
were
renewed
and
i
was
as
active
as
ever
in
the
opposition
being
the
penman
first
of
the
request
to
have
a
communication
of
the
instructions
and
then
of
the
remarks
upon
them
which
may
be
found
in
the
votes
of
the
time
and
in
the
historical
review
i
afterward
publish
but
between
us
personally
no
enmity
arose
we
were
often
together
he
was
a
man
of
letters
had
seen
much
of
the
world
and
was
very
entertaining
and
pleasing
in
conversation
he
gave
me
the
first
information
that
my
old
friend
jas
ralph
was
still
alive
that
he
was
esteem
one
of
the
best
political
writers
in
england
had
been
in
the
dispute
between
prince
frederic
and
the
king
and
had
obtain
a
pension
of
three
hundred
a
year
that
his
reputation
was
indeed
small
as
a
poet
pope
having
damned
his
poetry
in
the
dunciad
but
his
prose
was
thought
as
good
as
any
man
the
assembly
finally
finding
the
proprietary
obstinately
persisted
in
manacling
their
deputies
with
instructions
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
privileges
of
the
people
but
with
the
service
of
the
crown
resolv
to
petition
the
king
against
them
and
appointed
me
their
agent
to
go
over
to
england
to
present
and
support
the
petition
the
house
had
sent
up
a
bill
to
the
governor
granting
a
sum
of
sixty
thousand
pounds
for
the
king
use
ten
thousand
pounds
of
which
was
subjected
to
the
orders
of
the
then
general
lord
loudoun
which
the
governor
absolutely
refus
to
pass
in
compliance
with
his
instructions
the
many
unanimous
resolves
of
the
assembly
what
date
marg
note
i
had
agreed
with
captain
morris
of
the
paquet
at
new
york
for
my
passage
and
my
stores
were
put
on
board
when
lord
loudoun
arriv
at
philadelphia
expressly
as
he
told
me
to
endeavor
an
accommodation
between
the
governor
and
assembly
that
his
majesty
service
might
not
be
obstructed
by
their
dissensions
accordingly
he
desir
the
governor
and
myself
to
meet
him
that
he
might
hear
what
was
to
be
said
on
both
sides
we
met
and
discuss
the
business
in
behalf
of
the
assembly
i
urg
all
the
various
arguments
that
may
be
found
in
the
public
papers
of
that
time
which
were
of
my
writing
and
are
printed
with
the
minutes
of
the
assembly
and
the
governor
pleaded
his
instructions
the
bond
he
had
given
to
observe
them
and
his
ruin
if
he
disobey
yet
seemed
not
unwilling
to
hazard
himself
if
lord
loudoun
would
advise
it
this
his
lordship
did
not
chuse
to
do
though
i
once
thought
i
had
nearly
prevail
with
him
to
do
it
but
finally
he
rather
chose
to
urge
the
compliance
of
the
assembly
and
he
entreated
me
to
use
my
endeavours
with
them
for
that
purpose
declaring
that
he
would
spare
none
of
the
king
troops
for
the
defense
of
our
frontiers
and
that
if
we
did
not
continue
to
provide
for
that
defense
ourselves
they
must
remain
to
the
enemy
i
acquainted
the
house
with
what
had
pass
and
presenting
them
with
a
set
of
resolutions
i
had
drawn
up
declaring
our
rights
and
that
we
did
not
relinquish
our
claim
to
those
rights
but
only
suspended
the
exercise
of
them
on
this
occasion
thro
force
against
which
we
protested
they
at
length
agreed
to
drop
that
bill
and
frame
another
conformable
to
the
proprietary
instructions
this
of
course
the
governor
pass
and
i
was
then
at
liberty
to
proceed
on
my
voyage
but
in
the
meantime
the
paquet
had
sailed
with
my
which
was
some
loss
to
me
and
my
only
recompense
was
his
lordship
thanks
for
my
service
all
the
credit
of
obtaining
the
accommodation
falling
to
his
share
he
set
out
for
new
york
before
me
and
as
the
time
for
dispatching
the
was
at
his
disposition
and
there
were
two
then
remaining
there
one
of
which
he
said
was
to
sail
very
soon
i
requested
to
know
the
precise
time
that
i
might
not
miss
her
by
any
delay
of
mine
his
answer
was
i
have
given
out
that
she
is
to
sail
on
saturday
next
but
i
may
let
you
know
entre
nous
that
if
you
are
there
by
monday
morning
you
will
be
in
time
but
do
not
delay
longer
by
some
accidental
hinderance
at
a
ferry
it
was
monday
noon
before
i
arrived
and
i
was
much
afraid
she
might
have
sailed
as
the
wind
was
fair
but
i
was
soon
made
easy
by
the
information
that
she
was
still
in
the
harbor
and
would
not
move
till
the
next
day
one
would
imagine
that
i
was
now
on
the
very
point
of
departing
for
europe
i
thought
so
but
i
was
not
then
so
well
acquainted
with
his
lordship
character
of
which
indecision
was
one
of
the
strongest
features
i
shall
give
some
instances
it
was
about
the
beginning
of
april
that
i
came
to
new
york
and
i
think
it
was
near
the
end
of
june
before
we
sail
there
were
then
two
of
the
which
had
been
long
in
port
but
were
detained
for
the
letters
which
were
always
to
be
ready
another
paquet
arriv
she
too
was
detain
and
before
we
sail
a
fourth
was
expected
ours
was
the
first
to
be
dispatch
as
having
been
there
longest
passengers
were
engag
in
all
and
some
extremely
impatient
to
be
gone
and
the
merchants
uneasy
about
their
letters
and
the
orders
they
had
given
for
insurance
it
being
war
time
for
fall
goods
but
their
anxiety
avail
nothing
his
lordship
letters
were
not
ready
and
yet
whoever
waited
on
him
found
him
always
at
his
desk
pen
in
hand
and
concluded
he
must
needs
write
abundantly
going
myself
one
morning
to
pay
my
respects
i
found
in
his
antechamber
one
innis
a
messenger
of
philadelphia
who
had
come
from
thence
express
with
a
paquet
from
governor
denny
for
the
general
he
delivered
to
me
some
letters
from
my
friends
there
which
occasion
my
inquiring
when
he
was
to
return
and
where
he
lodg
that
i
might
send
some
letters
by
him
he
told
me
he
was
order
to
call
at
nine
for
the
general
answer
to
the
governor
and
should
set
off
immediately
i
put
my
letters
into
his
hands
the
same
day
a
fortnight
after
i
met
him
again
in
the
same
place
so
you
are
soon
return
innis
returned
no
i
am
not
gone
yet
how
so
i
have
called
here
by
order
every
morning
these
two
weeks
past
for
his
lordship
letter
and
it
is
not
yet
ready
is
it
possible
when
he
is
so
great
a
writer
for
i
see
him
constantly
at
his
escritoire
yes
says
innis
but
he
is
like
george
on
the
signs
always
on
horseback
and
never
rides
on
this
observation
of
the
messenger
was
it
seems
well
founded
for
when
in
england
i
understood
that
pitt
gave
it
as
one
reason
for
removing
this
general
and
sending
generals
amherst
and
wolfe
that
the
minister
never
heard
from
him
and
could
not
know
what
he
was
doing
this
daily
expectation
of
sailing
and
all
the
three
paquets
going
down
to
sandy
hook
to
join
the
fleet
there
the
passengers
thought
it
best
to
be
on
board
lest
by
a
sudden
order
the
ships
should
sail
and
they
be
left
behind
there
if
i
remember
right
we
were
about
six
weeks
consuming
our
and
oblig
to
procure
more
at
length
the
fleet
sail
the
general
and
all
his
army
on
board
bound
to
louisburg
with
intent
to
besiege
and
take
that
fortress
all
the
in
company
ordered
to
attend
the
general
ship
ready
to
receive
his
dispatches
when
they
should
be
ready
we
were
out
five
days
before
we
got
a
letter
with
leave
to
part
and
then
our
ship
quitted
the
fleet
and
steered
for
england
the
other
two
paquets
he
still
detained
carried
them
with
him
to
halifax
where
he
stayed
some
time
to
exercise
the
men
in
sham
attacks
upon
sham
forts
then
alter
his
mind
as
to
besieging
louisburg
and
return
to
new
york
with
all
his
troops
together
with
the
two
paquets
above
mentioned
and
all
their
passengers
during
his
absence
the
french
and
savages
had
taken
fort
george
on
the
frontier
of
that
province
and
the
savages
had
massacred
many
of
the
garrison
after
capitulation
i
saw
afterwards
in
london
captain
bonnell
who
commanded
one
of
those
paquets
he
told
me
that
when
he
had
been
detain
a
month
he
acquainted
his
lordship
that
his
ship
was
grown
foul
to
a
degree
that
must
necessarily
hinder
her
fast
sailing
a
point
of
consequence
for
a
and
requested
an
allowance
of
time
to
heave
her
down
and
clean
her
bottom
he
was
asked
how
long
that
would
require
he
answer
three
days
the
general
replied
if
you
can
do
it
in
one
day
i
give
leave
otherwise
not
for
you
must
certainly
sail
the
day
after
so
he
never
obtain
leave
though
detained
afterwards
from
day
to
day
during
full
three
months
i
saw
also
in
london
one
of
bonnell
passengers
who
was
so
against
his
lordship
for
deceiving
and
detaining
him
so
long
at
new
york
and
then
carrying
him
to
halifax
and
back
again
that
he
swore
he
would
sue
for
damages
whether
he
did
or
not
i
never
heard
but
as
he
represented
the
injury
to
his
affairs
it
was
very
considerable
on
the
whole
i
wonder
much
how
such
a
man
came
to
be
intrusted
with
so
important
a
business
as
the
conduct
of
a
great
army
but
having
since
seen
more
of
the
great
world
and
the
means
of
obtaining
and
motives
for
giving
places
my
wonder
is
diminished
general
shirley
on
whom
the
command
of
the
army
devolved
upon
the
death
of
braddock
would
in
my
opinion
if
continued
in
place
have
made
a
much
better
campaign
than
that
of
loudoun
in
which
was
frivolous
expensive
and
disgraceful
to
our
nation
beyond
conception
for
tho
shirley
was
not
a
bred
soldier
he
was
sensible
and
sagacious
in
himself
and
attentive
to
good
advice
from
others
capable
of
forming
judicious
plans
and
quick
and
active
in
carrying
them
into
execution
loudoun
instead
of
defending
the
colonies
with
his
great
army
left
them
totally
while
he
paraded
idly
at
halifax
by
which
means
fort
george
was
lost
besides
he
derang
all
our
mercantile
operations
and
distress
our
trade
by
a
long
embargo
on
the
exportation
of
provisions
on
pretence
of
keeping
supplies
from
being
obtain
by
the
enemy
but
in
reality
for
beating
down
their
price
in
favor
of
the
contractors
in
whose
profits
it
was
said
perhaps
from
suspicion
only
he
had
a
share
and
when
at
length
the
embargo
was
taken
off
by
neglecting
to
send
notice
of
it
to
charlestown
the
carolina
fleet
was
detain
near
three
months
longer
whereby
their
bottoms
were
so
much
damaged
by
the
worm
that
a
great
part
of
them
foundered
in
their
passage
home
shirley
was
i
believe
sincerely
glad
of
being
relieved
from
so
burdensome
a
charge
as
the
conduct
of
an
army
must
be
to
a
man
unacquainted
with
military
business
i
was
at
the
entertainment
given
by
the
city
of
new
york
to
lord
loudoun
on
his
taking
upon
him
the
command
shirley
tho
thereby
superseded
was
present
also
there
was
a
great
company
of
officers
citizens
and
strangers
and
some
chairs
having
been
borrowed
in
the
neighborhood
there
was
one
among
them
very
low
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
shirley
perceiving
it
as
i
sat
by
him
i
said
they
have
given
you
sir
too
low
a
seat
no
matter
says
he
franklin
i
find
a
low
seat
the
easiest
while
i
was
as
afore
mention
detain
at
new
york
i
receiv
all
the
accounts
of
the
provisions
that
i
had
furnish
to
braddock
some
of
which
accounts
could
not
sooner
be
obtain
from
the
different
persons
i
had
employ
to
assist
in
the
business
i
presented
them
to
lord
loudoun
desiring
to
be
paid
the
ballance
he
caus
them
to
be
regularly
examined
by
the
proper
officer
who
after
comparing
every
article
with
its
voucher
certified
them
to
be
right
and
the
balance
due
for
which
his
lordship
promis
to
give
me
an
order
on
the
paymaster
this
was
however
put
off
from
time
to
time
and
tho
i
call
often
for
it
by
appointment
i
did
not
get
it
at
length
just
before
my
departure
he
told
me
he
had
on
better
consideration
concluded
not
to
mix
his
accounts
with
those
of
his
predecessors
and
you
says
he
when
in
england
have
only
to
exhibit
your
accounts
at
the
treasury
and
you
will
be
paid
immediately
i
mention
but
without
effect
the
great
and
unexpected
expense
i
had
been
put
to
by
being
detain
so
long
at
new
york
as
a
reason
for
my
desiring
to
be
presently
paid
and
on
my
observing
that
it
was
not
right
i
should
be
put
to
any
further
trouble
or
delay
in
obtaining
the
money
i
had
advanc
as
i
charged
no
commission
for
my
service
o
sir
says
he
you
must
not
think
of
persuading
us
that
you
are
no
gainer
we
understand
better
those
affairs
and
know
that
every
one
concerned
in
supplying
the
army
finds
means
in
the
doing
it
to
fill
his
own
pockets
i
assur
him
that
was
not
my
case
and
that
i
had
not
pocketed
a
farthing
but
he
appear
clearly
not
to
believe
me
and
indeed
i
have
since
learnt
that
immense
fortunes
are
often
made
in
such
employments
as
to
my
ballance
i
am
not
paid
it
to
this
day
of
which
more
hereafter
our
captain
of
the
paquet
had
boasted
much
before
we
sailed
of
the
swiftness
of
his
ship
unfortunately
when
we
came
to
sea
she
proved
the
dullest
of
sail
to
his
no
small
mortification
after
many
conjectures
respecting
the
cause
when
we
were
near
another
ship
almost
as
dull
as
ours
which
however
gain
upon
us
the
captain
ordered
all
hands
to
come
aft
and
stand
as
near
the
ensign
staff
as
possible
we
were
passengers
included
about
forty
persons
while
we
stood
there
the
ship
mended
her
pace
and
soon
left
her
neighbour
far
behind
which
prov
clearly
what
our
captain
suspected
that
she
was
loaded
too
much
by
the
head
the
casks
of
water
it
seems
had
been
all
plac
forward
these
he
therefore
order
to
be
mov
further
aft
on
which
the
ship
recover
her
character
and
proved
the
sailer
in
the
fleet
the
captain
said
she
had
once
gone
at
the
rate
of
thirteen
knots
which
is
accounted
thirteen
miles
per
hour
we
had
on
board
as
a
passenger
captain
kennedy
of
the
navy
who
contended
that
it
was
impossible
and
that
no
ship
ever
sailed
so
fast
and
that
there
must
have
been
some
error
in
the
division
of
the
or
some
mistake
in
heaving
the
log
a
wager
ensu
between
the
two
captains
to
be
decided
when
there
should
be
sufficient
wind
kennedy
thereupon
examin
rigorously
the
and
being
satisfi
with
that
he
determin
to
throw
the
log
himself
accordingly
some
days
after
when
the
wind
blew
very
fair
and
fresh
and
the
captain
of
the
paquet
lutwidge
said
he
believ
she
then
went
at
the
rate
of
thirteen
knots
kennedy
made
the
experiment
and
own
his
wager
lost
the
above
fact
i
give
for
the
sake
of
the
following
observation
it
has
been
remark
as
an
imperfection
in
the
art
of
that
it
can
never
be
known
till
she
is
tried
whether
a
new
ship
will
or
will
not
be
a
good
sailer
for
that
the
model
of
a
ship
has
been
exactly
follow
in
a
new
one
which
has
prov
on
the
contrary
remarkably
dull
i
apprehend
that
this
may
partly
be
occasion
by
the
different
opinions
of
seamen
respecting
the
modes
of
lading
rigging
and
sailing
of
a
ship
each
has
his
system
and
the
same
vessel
laden
by
the
judgment
and
orders
of
one
captain
shall
sail
better
or
worse
than
when
by
the
orders
of
another
besides
it
scarce
ever
happens
that
a
ship
is
form
fitted
for
the
sea
and
sail
by
the
same
person
one
man
builds
the
hull
another
rigs
her
a
third
lades
and
sails
her
no
one
of
these
has
the
advantage
of
knowing
all
the
ideas
and
experience
of
the
others
and
therefore
can
not
draw
just
conclusions
from
a
combination
of
the
whole
even
in
the
simple
operation
of
sailing
when
at
sea
i
have
often
observ
different
judgments
in
the
officers
who
commanded
the
successive
watches
the
wind
being
the
same
one
would
have
the
sails
trimm
sharper
or
flatter
than
another
so
that
they
seem
to
have
no
certain
rule
to
govern
by
yet
i
think
a
set
of
experiments
might
be
instituted
first
to
determine
the
most
proper
form
of
the
hull
for
swift
sailing
next
the
best
dimensions
and
properest
place
for
the
masts
then
the
form
and
quantity
of
sails
and
their
position
as
the
wind
may
be
and
lastly
the
disposition
of
the
lading
this
is
an
age
of
experiments
and
i
think
a
set
accurately
made
and
combin
would
be
of
great
use
i
am
persuaded
therefore
that
ere
long
some
ingenious
philosopher
will
undertake
it
to
whom
i
wish
success
we
were
several
times
chas
in
our
passage
but
outsail
every
thing
and
in
thirty
days
had
soundings
we
had
a
good
observation
and
the
captain
judg
himself
so
near
our
port
falmouth
that
if
we
made
a
good
run
in
the
night
we
might
be
off
the
mouth
of
that
harbor
in
the
morning
and
by
running
in
the
night
might
escape
the
notice
of
the
enemy
privateers
who
often
crus
near
the
entrance
of
the
channel
accordingly
all
the
sail
was
set
that
we
could
possibly
make
and
the
wind
being
very
fresh
and
fair
we
went
right
before
it
and
made
great
way
the
captain
after
his
observation
shap
his
course
as
he
thought
so
as
to
pass
wide
of
the
scilly
isles
but
it
seems
there
is
sometimes
a
strong
indraught
setting
up
george
channel
which
deceives
seamen
and
caused
the
loss
of
sir
cloudesley
shovel
squadron
this
indraught
was
probably
the
cause
of
what
happened
to
us
we
had
a
watchman
plac
in
the
bow
to
whom
they
often
called
look
well
out
before
there
and
he
as
often
answered
ay
ay
but
perhaps
had
his
eyes
shut
and
was
half
asleep
at
the
time
they
sometimes
answering
as
is
said
mechanically
for
he
did
not
see
a
light
just
before
us
which
had
been
hid
by
the
studdingsails
from
the
man
at
the
helm
and
from
the
rest
of
the
watch
but
by
an
accidental
yaw
of
the
ship
was
discover
and
occasion
a
great
alarm
we
being
very
near
it
the
light
appearing
to
me
as
big
as
a
it
was
midnight
and
our
captain
fast
asleep
but
captain
kennedy
jumping
upon
deck
and
seeing
the
danger
ordered
the
ship
to
wear
round
all
sails
standing
an
operation
dangerous
to
the
masts
but
it
carried
us
clear
and
we
escaped
shipwreck
for
we
were
running
right
upon
the
rocks
on
which
the
was
erected
this
deliverance
impressed
me
strongly
with
the
utility
of
and
made
me
resolve
to
encourage
the
building
more
of
them
in
america
if
i
should
live
to
return
there
in
the
morning
it
was
found
by
the
soundings
that
we
were
near
our
port
but
a
thick
fog
hid
the
land
from
our
sight
about
nine
the
fog
began
to
rise
and
seem
to
be
lifted
up
from
the
water
like
the
curtain
at
a
discovering
underneath
the
town
of
falmouth
the
vessels
in
its
harbor
and
the
fields
that
surrounded
it
this
was
a
most
pleasing
spectacle
to
those
who
had
been
so
long
without
any
other
prospects
than
the
uniform
view
of
a
vacant
ocean
and
it
gave
us
the
more
pleasure
as
we
were
now
free
from
the
anxieties
which
the
state
of
war
occasion
i
set
out
immediately
with
my
son
for
london
and
we
only
stopt
a
little
by
the
way
to
view
stonehenge
on
salisbury
plain
and
lord
pembroke
house
and
gardens
with
his
very
curious
antiquities
at
wilton
we
arrived
in
london
the
of
july
here
terminates
the
autobiography
as
published
by
wm
temple
franklin
and
his
successors
what
follows
was
written
in
the
last
year
of
franklin
life
and
was
first
printed
in
english
in
bigelow
edition
of
ed
as
soon
as
i
was
settled
in
a
lodging
charles
had
provided
for
me
i
went
to
visit
fothergill
to
whom
i
was
strongly
recommended
and
whose
counsel
respecting
my
proceedings
i
was
advis
to
obtain
he
was
against
an
immediate
complaint
to
government
and
thought
the
proprietaries
should
first
be
personally
appli
to
who
might
possibly
be
induc
by
the
interposition
and
persuasion
of
some
private
friends
to
accommodate
matters
amicably
i
then
waited
on
my
old
friend
and
correspondent
peter
collinson
who
told
me
that
john
hanbury
the
great
virginia
merchant
had
requested
to
be
informed
when
i
should
arrive
that
he
might
carry
me
to
lord
granville
who
was
then
president
of
the
council
and
wished
to
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
i
agreed
to
go
with
him
the
next
morning
accordingly
hanbury
called
for
me
and
took
me
in
his
carriage
to
that
nobleman
who
receiv
me
with
great
civility
and
after
some
questions
respecting
the
present
state
of
affairs
in
america
and
discourse
thereupon
he
said
to
me
you
americans
have
wrong
ideas
of
the
nature
of
your
constitution
you
contend
that
the
king
instructions
to
his
governors
are
not
laws
and
think
yourselves
at
liberty
to
regard
or
disregard
them
at
your
own
discretion
but
those
instructions
are
not
like
the
pocket
instructions
given
to
a
minister
going
abroad
for
regulating
his
conduct
in
some
trifling
point
of
ceremony
they
are
first
drawn
up
by
judges
learned
in
the
laws
they
are
then
considered
debated
and
perhaps
amended
in
council
after
which
they
are
signed
by
the
king
they
are
then
so
far
as
they
relate
to
you
the
law
of
the
land
for
the
king
is
the
legislator
of
the
colonies
i
told
his
lordship
this
was
new
doctrine
to
me
i
had
always
understood
from
our
charters
that
our
laws
were
to
be
made
by
our
assemblies
to
be
presented
indeed
to
the
king
for
his
royal
assent
but
that
being
once
given
the
king
could
not
repeal
or
alter
them
and
as
the
assemblies
could
not
make
permanent
laws
without
his
assent
so
neither
could
he
make
a
law
for
them
without
theirs
he
assur
me
i
was
totally
mistaken
i
did
not
think
so
however
and
his
lordship
conversation
having
a
little
alarm
me
as
to
what
might
be
the
sentiments
of
the
court
concerning
us
i
wrote
it
down
as
soon
as
i
return
to
my
lodgings
i
recollected
that
about
years
before
a
clause
in
a
bill
brought
into
parliament
by
the
ministry
had
propos
to
make
the
king
instructions
laws
in
the
colonies
but
the
clause
was
thrown
out
by
the
commons
for
which
we
adored
them
as
our
friends
and
friends
of
liberty
till
by
their
conduct
towards
us
in
it
that
they
had
refus
that
point
of
sovereignty
to
the
king
only
that
they
might
reserve
it
for
themselves
after
some
days
fothergill
having
spoken
to
the
proprietaries
they
agreed
to
a
meeting
with
me
at
penn
house
in
spring
garden
the
conversation
at
first
consisted
of
mutual
declarations
of
disposition
to
reasonable
accommodations
but
i
suppose
each
party
had
its
own
ideas
of
what
should
be
meant
by
reasonable
we
then
went
into
consideration
of
our
several
points
of
complaint
which
i
enumerated
the
proprietaries
justify
their
conduct
as
well
as
they
could
and
i
the
assembly
we
now
appeared
very
wide
and
so
far
from
each
other
in
our
opinions
as
to
discourage
all
hope
of
agreement
however
it
was
concluded
that
i
should
give
them
the
heads
of
our
complaints
in
writing
and
they
promis
then
to
consider
them
i
did
so
soon
after
but
they
put
the
paper
into
the
hands
of
their
solicitor
ferdinand
john
paris
who
managed
for
them
all
their
law
business
in
their
great
suit
with
the
neighbouring
proprietary
of
maryland
lord
baltimore
which
had
subsisted
years
and
wrote
for
them
all
their
papers
and
messages
in
their
dispute
with
the
assembly
he
was
a
proud
angry
man
and
as
i
had
occasionally
in
the
answers
of
the
assembly
treated
his
papers
with
some
severity
they
being
really
weak
in
point
of
argument
and
haughty
in
expression
he
had
conceived
a
mortal
enmity
to
me
which
discovering
itself
whenever
we
met
i
declin
the
proprietary
proposal
that
he
and
i
should
discuss
the
heads
of
complaint
between
our
two
selves
and
refus
treating
with
any
one
but
them
they
then
by
his
advice
put
the
paper
into
the
hands
of
the
attorney
and
for
their
opinion
and
counsel
upon
it
where
it
lay
unanswered
a
year
wanting
eight
days
during
which
time
i
made
frequent
demands
of
an
answer
from
the
proprietaries
but
without
obtaining
any
other
than
that
they
had
not
yet
received
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
and
what
it
was
when
they
did
receive
it
i
never
learnt
for
they
did
not
communicate
it
to
me
but
sent
a
long
message
to
the
assembly
drawn
and
signed
by
paris
reciting
my
paper
complaining
of
its
want
of
formality
as
a
rudeness
on
my
part
and
giving
a
flimsy
justification
of
their
conduct
adding
that
they
should
be
willing
to
accommodate
matters
if
the
assembly
would
send
out
some
person
of
candour
to
treat
with
them
for
that
purpose
intimating
thereby
that
i
was
not
such
the
want
of
formality
or
rudeness
was
probably
my
not
having
the
paper
to
them
with
their
assum
titles
of
true
and
absolute
proprietaries
of
the
province
of
pennsylvania
which
i
omitted
as
not
thinking
it
necessary
in
a
paper
the
intention
of
which
was
only
to
reduce
to
a
certainty
by
writing
what
in
conversation
i
had
delivered
viva
voce
but
during
this
delay
the
assembly
having
prevailed
with
denny
to
pass
an
act
taxing
the
proprietary
estate
in
common
with
the
estates
of
the
people
which
was
the
grand
point
in
dispute
they
omitted
answering
the
message
when
this
act
however
came
over
the
proprietaries
counselled
by
paris
determined
to
oppose
its
receiving
the
royal
assent
accordingly
they
petition
the
king
in
council
and
a
hearing
was
appointed
in
which
two
lawyers
were
employ
by
them
against
the
act
and
two
by
me
in
support
of
it
they
alledg
that
the
act
was
intended
to
load
the
proprietary
estate
in
order
to
spare
those
of
the
people
and
that
if
it
were
suffer
to
continue
in
force
and
the
proprietaries
who
were
in
odium
with
the
people
left
to
their
mercy
in
proportioning
the
taxes
they
would
inevitably
be
ruined
we
reply
that
the
act
had
no
such
intention
and
would
have
no
such
effect
that
the
assessors
were
honest
and
discreet
men
under
an
oath
to
assess
fairly
and
equitably
and
that
any
advantage
each
of
them
might
expect
in
lessening
his
own
tax
by
augmenting
that
of
the
proprietaries
was
too
trifling
to
induce
them
to
perjure
themselves
this
is
the
purport
of
what
i
remember
as
urged
by
both
sides
except
that
we
insisted
strongly
on
the
mischievous
consequences
that
must
attend
a
repeal
for
that
the
money
being
printed
and
given
to
the
king
use
expended
in
his
service
and
now
spread
among
the
people
the
repeal
would
strike
it
dead
in
their
hands
to
the
ruin
of
many
and
the
total
discouragement
of
future
grants
and
the
selfishness
of
the
proprietors
in
soliciting
such
a
general
catastrophe
merely
from
a
groundless
fear
of
their
estate
being
taxed
too
highly
was
insisted
on
in
the
strongest
terms
on
this
lord
mansfield
one
of
the
counsel
rose
and
beckoning
me
took
me
into
the
clerk
chamber
while
the
lawyers
were
pleading
and
asked
me
if
i
was
really
of
opinion
that
no
injury
would
be
done
the
proprietary
estate
in
the
execution
of
the
act
i
said
certainly
then
says
he
you
can
have
little
objection
to
enter
into
an
engagement
to
assure
that
point
i
answer
none
at
all
he
then
call
in
paris
and
after
some
discourse
his
lordship
proposition
was
accepted
on
both
sides
a
paper
to
the
purpose
was
drawn
up
by
the
clerk
of
the
council
which
i
sign
with
charles
who
was
also
an
agent
of
the
province
for
their
ordinary
affairs
when
lord
mansfield
returned
to
the
council
chamber
where
finally
the
law
was
allowed
to
pass
some
changes
were
however
recommended
and
we
also
engaged
they
should
be
made
by
a
subsequent
law
but
the
assembly
did
not
think
them
necessary
for
one
year
tax
having
been
levied
by
the
act
before
the
order
of
council
arrived
they
appointed
a
committee
to
examine
the
proceedings
of
the
assessors
and
on
this
committee
they
put
several
particular
friends
of
the
proprietaries
after
a
full
enquiry
they
unanimously
sign
a
report
that
they
found
the
tax
had
been
assess
with
perfect
equity
the
assembly
looked
into
my
entering
into
the
first
part
of
the
engagement
as
an
essential
service
to
the
province
since
it
secured
the
credit
of
the
paper
money
then
spread
over
all
the
country
they
gave
me
their
thanks
in
form
when
i
return
but
the
proprietaries
were
enraged
at
governor
denny
for
having
pass
the
act
and
turn
him
out
with
threats
of
suing
him
for
breach
of
instructions
which
he
had
given
bond
to
observe
he
however
having
done
it
at
the
instance
of
the
general
and
for
his
majesty
service
and
having
some
powerful
interests
at
court

threats

philadelphia
editor
on
franklin
autobiography
and
yet
the
surprising
and
delightful
thing
about
this
book
the
autobiography
is
that
take
it
all
in
all
it
has
not
the
low
tone
of
conceit
but
is
a
staunch
man
sober
and
unaffected
assessment
of
himself
and
the
circumstances
of
his
career
woodrow
wilson
such
for
example
was
benjamin
franklin
whose
charming
autobiography
in
addition
to
being
an
american
classic
is
a
fine
record
of
charles
a
beard
mary
ritter
beard
for
understanding
the
temper
and
ideals
of
america
in
the
eighteenth
century
no
writings
are
of
equal
importance
with
those
of
john
adams
and
benjamin
franklin
especially
the
diary
of
the
former
works
of
john
adams
vols
boston
and
the
autobiography
of
the
latter
in
his
collected
works
and
separately
printed
in
many
editions
carl
lotus
becker
no
man
has
shed
such
copious
good
influence
on
america
none
added
so
much
new
truth
to
the
popular
knowledge
none
has
so
skillfully
organized
its
ideas
into
institutions
none
has
so
powerfully
and
wisely
directed
the
nation
conduct
and
advanced
its
welfare
in
so
many
respects
no
man
now
has
so
strong
a
hold
on
the
habits
and
manners
of
the
people
franklin
comes
home
to
the
individual
business
of
practical
men
in
their
daily
life
theodore
parker
the
autobiography
is
also
a
uniquely
american
book
after
a
life
like
franklin
had
become
possible
and
could
be
described
the
declaration
of
independence
seems
understandable
and
much
less
revolutionary
there
was
in
america
a
society
which
valued
the
things
franklin
could
do
well
work
hard
write
effectively
plan
improvements
conciliate
differences
and
conduct
public
affairs
with
popular
needs
and
interests
in
view
his
autobiography
records
these
achievements
and
values
and
habits
which
made
them
possible
and
tells
how
a
remarkable
human
being
used
his
heritage
and
created
a
life
on
a
new
revolutionary
model

the

of

for
a
list
of
changes
there
are
many
misspelled
words
in
this

but
we
made
three
changes
which
we
believe
were
made
by
the
editor
or
publisher
after
the
three
changes
that
we
made
those
sentences
match

by
the

in
the
hope
of
providing
a
better
reading
experience
the
four
parts
of
this

correspond
to
the
four
parts
of

luckily
those
four
parts
were
the
same
breaks

no

be
detected
the

no

than
that

how
