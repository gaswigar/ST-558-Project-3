a

to

before

as

i
hate
deception

not

subterfuge
this
is
why
after

year

more
of
hesitation
i
have
felt
myself
constrained
to
put
into
words
the
true
history
of
the
events
surrounding
the
solution
of
that
great
mystery
which
made

the
dread
of

feminine

a
natural
shrinking
from
revealing
to
the
world
certain
weaknesses
on
my
part
inseparable
from
a
true
relation
of
this
tale
led
me
to
consent
to
the
publication
of
that
meagre
and
decidedly
falsified
account
of
the
matter
which
has
appeared

lost

the
knollys
family
i
a
visit
from
gryce
ever
since
my
fortunate
or
shall
i
say
unfortunate
connection
with
that
famous
case
of
murder
in
gramercy
park
i
have
had
it
intimated
to
me
by
many
of
my
friends
and
by
some
who
were
not
my
friends
that
no
woman
who
had
met
with
such
success
as
myself
in
detective
work
would
ever
be
satisfied
with
a
single
display
of
her
powers
and
that
sooner
or
later
i
would
find
myself
again
at
work
upon
some
other
case
of
striking
peculiarities
as
vanity
has
never
been
my
foible
and
as
moreover
i
never
have
forsaken
and
never
am
likely
to
forsake
the
plain
path
marked
out
for
my
sex
at
any
other
call
than
that
of
duty
i
invariably
responded
to
these
insinuations
by
an
affable
but
incredulous
smile
striving
to
excuse
the
presumption
of
my
friends
by
remembering
their
ignorance
of
my
nature
and
the
very
excellent
reasons
i
had
for
my
one
notable
interference
in
the
police
affairs
of
new
york
city
besides
though
i
appeared
to
be
resting
quietly
if
not
in
entire
contentment
on
my
laurels
i
was
not
so
utterly
removed
from
the
old
atmosphere
of
crime
and
its
detection
as
the
world
in
general
considered
me
to
be
gryce
still
visited
me
not
on
business
of
course
but
as
a
friend
for
whom
i
had
some
regard
and
naturally
our
conversation
was
not
always
confined
to
the
weather
or
even
to
city
politics
provocative
as
the
latter
subject
is
of
wholesome
controversy
not
that
he
ever
betrayed
any
of
the
secrets
of
his
office
oh
no
that
would
have
been
too
much
to
expect
but
he
did
sometimes
mention
the
outward
aspects
of
some
celebrated
case
and
though
i
never
ventured
upon
advice
i
know
too
much
for
that
i
hope
i
found
my
wits
more
or
less
exercised
by
a
conversation
in
which
he
gained
much
without
acknowledging
it
and
i
gave
much
without
appearing
conscious
of
the
fact
i
was
therefore
finding
life
pleasant
and
full
of
interest
when
suddenly
i
had
no
right
to
expect
it
and
i
do
not
blame
myself
for
not
expecting
it
or
for
holding
my
head
so
high
at
the
prognostications
of
my
friends
an
opportunity
came
for
a
direct
exercise
of
my
detective
powers
in
a
line
seemingly
so
laid
out
for
me
by
providence
that
i
felt
i
would
be
slighting
the
powers
above
if
i
refused
to
enter
upon
it
though
now
i
see
that
the
line
was
laid
out
for
me
by
gryce
and
that
i
was
obeying
anything
but
the
call
of
duty
in
following
it
but
this
is
not
explicit
one
night
gryce
came
to
my
house
looking
older
and
more
feeble
than
usual
he
was
engaged
in
a
perplexing
case
he
said
and
missed
his
early
vigor
and
persistency
would
i
like
to
hear
about
it
it
was
not
in
the
line
of
his
usual
work
yet
it
had
points
and
well
it
would
do
him
good
to
talk
about
it
to
a
who
was
capable
of
sympathizing
with
its
baffling
and
worrisome
features
and
yet
would
never
have
to
be
told
to
hold
her
peace
i
ought
to
have
been
on
my
guard
i
ought
to
have
known
the
old
fox
well
enough
to
feel
certain
that
when
he
went
so
manifestly
out
of
his
way
to
take
me
into
his
confidence
he
did
it
for
a
purpose
but
jove
nods
now
and
then
or
so
i
have
been
assured
on
unimpeachable
authority
and
if
jove
has
ever
been
caught
napping
surely
amelia
butterworth
may
be
pardoned
a
like
inconsistency
it
is
not
a
city
crime
gryce
went
on
to
explain
and
here
he
was
base
enough
to
sigh
at
my
time
of
life
this
is
an
important
consideration
it
is
no
longer
a
simple
matter
for
me
to
pack
up
a
valise
and
go
off
to
some
distant
village
way
up
in
the
mountains
perhaps
where
comforts
are
few
and
secrecy
an
impossibility
comforts
have
become
indispensable
to
my
threescore
years
and
ten
and
secrecy
well
if
ever
there
was
an
affair
where
one
needs
to
go
softly
it
is
this
one
as
you
will
see
if
you
will
allow
me
to
give
you
the
facts
of
the
case
as
known
at
headquarters
i
bowed
trying
not
to
show
my
surprise
or
my
extreme
satisfaction
gryce
assumed
his
most
benignant
aspect
always
a
dangerous
one
with
him
and
began
his
story
ii
i
am
tempted
some
ninety
miles
from
here
in
a
more
or
less
inaccessible
region
there
is
a
small
but
interesting
village
which
has
been
the
scene
of
so
many
unaccountable
disappearances
that
the
attention
of
the
new
york
police
has
at
last
been
directed
to
it
the
village
which
is
at
least
two
miles
from
any
railroad
is
one
of
those
quiet
placid
little
spots
found
now
and
then
among
the
mountains
where
life
is
simple
and
crime
to
all
appearance
an
element
so
out
of
accord
with
every
other
characteristic
of
the
place
as
to
seem
a
complete
anomaly
yet
crime
or
some
other
hideous
mystery
almost
equally
revolting
has
during
the
last
five
years
been
accountable
for
the
disappearance
in
or
about
this
village
of
four
persons
of
various
ages
and
occupations
of
these
three
were
strangers
and
one
a
vagabond
accustomed
to
tramp
the
hills
and
live
on
the
bounty
of
farmers
wives
all
were
of
the
male
sex
and
in
no
case
has
any
clue
ever
come
to
light
as
to
their
fate
that
is
the
matter
as
it
stands
before
the
police
a
serious
affair
i
remarked
seems
to
me
i
have
read
of
such
things
in
novels
is
there
a
old
inn
in
the
vicinity
where
beds
are
made
up
over
his
smile
was
a
mild
protest
against
my
flippancy
i
have
visited
the
town
myself
there
is
no
inn
there
but
a
comfortable
hotel
of
the
most
sort
kept
by
the
frankest
and
most
of
landlords
besides
these
disappearances
as
a
rule
did
not
take
place
at
night
but
in
broad
daylight
imagine
this
street
at
noon
it
is
a
short
one
and
you
know
every
house
on
it
and
you
think
you
know
every
you
see
a
man
enter
it
at
one
end
and
you
expect
him
to
issue
from
it
at
the
other
but
suppose
he
never
does
more
than
that
suppose
he
is
never
heard
of
again
and
that
this
thing
should
happen
in
this
one
street
four
times
during
five
years
i
should
move
i
dryly
responded
would
you
many
good
people
have
moved
from
the
place
i
speak
of
but
that
has
not
helped
matters
the
disappearances
go
on
just
the
same
and
the
mystery
continues
you
interest
me
i
said
come
to
think
of
it
if
this
street
were
the
scene
of
such
an
unexplained
series
of
horrors
as
you
have
described
i
do
not
think
i
should
move
i
thought
not
he
curtly
rejoined
but
since
you
are
interested
in
this
matter
let
me
be
more
explicit
in
my
statements
the
first
person
whose
disappearance
was
noted
wait
i
interrupted
have
you
a
map
of
the
place
he
smiled
nodded
quite
affectionately
to
a
little
statuette
on
the
which
had
had
the
honor
of
sharing
his
confidences
in
days
gone
by
but
did
not
produce
the
map
that
detail
will
keep
said
he
let
me
go
on
with
my
story
as
i
was
saying
madam
the
first
person
whose
disappearance
was
noted
in
this
place
was
a
peddler
of
small
wares
accustomed
to
tramp
the
mountains
on
this
occasion
he
had
been
in
town
longer
than
usual
and
was
known
to
have
sold
fully
half
of
his
goods
consequently
he
must
have
had
quite
a
sum
of
money
upon
him
one
day
his
pack
was
found
lying
under
a
cluster
of
bushes
in
a
wood
but
of
him
nothing
was
ever
again
heard
it
made
an
excitement
for
a
few
days
while
the
woods
were
being
searched
for
his
body
but
nothing
having
been
discovered
he
was
forgotten
and
everything
went
on
as
before
till
suddenly
public
attention
was
again
aroused
by
the
pouring
in
of
letters
containing
inquiries
in
regard
to
a
young
man
who
had
been
sent
there
from
duluth
to
collect
facts
in
a
law
case
and
who
after
a
certain
date
had
failed
to
communicate
with
his
firm
or
show
up
at
any
of
the
places
where
he
was
known
instantly
the
village
was
in
arms
many
remembered
the
young
man
and
some
two
or
three
of
the
villagers
could
recall
the
fact
of
having
seen
him
go
up
the
street
with
his
in
his
hand
as
if
on
his
way
to
the
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
could
fix
the
very
day
at
which
he
left
his
house
but
inquiries
at
the
station
failed
to
establish
the
fact
that
he
took
train
from
there
nor
were
the
most
minute
inquiries
into
his
fate
ever
attended
by
the
least
result
he
was
not
known
to
have
carried
much
money
but
he
carried
a
very
handsome
watch
and
wore
a
ring
of
more
than
ordinary
value
neither
of
which
has
ever
shown
up
at
any
pawnbroker
known
to
the
police
this
was
three
years
ago
the
next
occurrence
of
a
like
character
did
not
take
place
till
a
year
after
this
time
it
was
a
poor
old
man
from
hartford
who
vanished
almost
as
it
were
before
the
eyes
of
these
astounded
villagers
he
had
come
to
town
to
get
subscriptions
for
a
valuable
book
issued
by
a
publisher
he
had
been
more
or
less
successful
and
was
looking
very
cheerful
and
contented
when
one
morning
after
making
a
sale
at
a
certain
farmhouse
he
sat
down
to
dine
with
the
family
it
being
close
on
to
noon
he
had
eaten
several
mouthfuls
and
was
chatting
quite
freely
when
suddenly
they
saw
him
pause
clap
his
hand
to
his
pocket
and
rise
up
very
much
disturbed
have
left
my
behind
me
at
deacon
spear
he
cried
can
not
eat
with
it
out
of
my
possession
excuse
me
if
i
go
for
it
and
without
any
further
apologies
he
ran
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
road
in
the
direction
of
deacon
spear
he
never
reached
deacon
spear
nor
was
he
ever
seen
in
that
village
again
or
in
his
home
in
hartford
this
was
the
most
astonishing
mystery
of
all
within
a
radius
in
a
populous
country
town
this
man
disappeared
as
if
the
road
had
swallowed
him
and
closed
again
it
was
marvellous
it
was
incredible
and
remained
so
even
after
the
best
efforts
of
the
country
police
to
solve
the
mystery
had
exhausted
themselves
after
this
the
town
began
to
acquire
a
bad
name
and
one
or
two
families
moved
away
yet
no
one
was
found
who
was
willing
to
admit
that
these
various
persons
had
been
the
victims
of
foul
play
till
a
month
later
another
case
came
to
light
of
a
young
man
who
had
left
the
village
for
the
hillside
station
and
had
never
arrived
at
that
or
any
other
destination
so
far
as
could
be
learned
as
he
was
a
distant
relative
of
a
wealthy
cattle
owner
in
iowa
who
came
on
to
inquire
into
his
nephew
fate
the
excitement
ran
high
and
through
his
efforts
and
that
of
one
of
the
town
leading
citizens
the
services
of
our
office
were
called
into
play
but
the
result
has
been
nil
we
have
found
neither
the
bodies
of
these
men
nor
any
clue
to
their
fate
yet
have
been
there
i
suggested
he
nodded
wonderful
and
you
came
upon
no
suspicious
house
no
suspicious
person
the
finger
with
which
he
was
rubbing
his
eyeglasses
went
round
and
round
the
rims
with
a
slower
and
slower
and
still
more
thoughtful
motion
every
town
has
its
houses
he
slowly
remarked
and
as
for
persons
the
most
honest
often
wear
a
lowering
look
in
which
an
unbridled
imagination
can
see
guilt
i
never
trust
to
appearances
of
that
kind
what
else
can
you
trust
in
when
a
case
is
as
impenetrable
as
this
one
i
asked
his
finger
going
slower
and
slower
suddenly
stopped
in
my
knowledge
of
persons
he
replied
in
my
knowledge
of
their
fears
their
hopes
and
their
individual
concerns
if
i
were
twenty
years
younger
here
he
stole
a
glance
at
me
in
the
mirror
which
made
me
bridle
did
he
think
i
was
only
twenty
years
younger
than
himself
i
would
he
went
on
make
myself
so
acquainted
with
every
man
woman
and
child
there
that
here
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
jerk
but
the
day
for
that
is
passed
said
he
i
am
too
old
and
too
crippled
to
succeed
in
such
an
undertaking
having
been
there
once
i
am
a
marked
man
my
very
walk
betrays
me
he
whose
good
fortune
it
will
be
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
these
people
hearts
must
awaken
no
suspicions
as
to
his
connection
with
the
police
indeed
i
do
not
think
that
any
man
can
succeed
in
doing
this
now
i
started
this
was
a
frank
showing
of
his
hand
at
least
no
man
it
was
then
a
woman
aid
he
was
after
i
laughed
as
i
thought
of
it
i
had
not
thought
him
either
so
presumptuous
or
so
appreciative
of
talents
of
a
character
so
directly
in
line
with
his
own
do
you
agree
with
me
madam
i
did
agree
with
him
but
i
had
a
character
of
great
dignity
to
maintain
so
i
simply
surveyed
him
with
an
air
of
severity
i
do
not
know
of
any
woman
who
would
undertake
such
a
task
i
calmly
observed
no
he
smiled
with
that
air
of
forbearance
which
is
so
exasperating
to
me
well
perhaps
there
is
any
such
woman
to
be
found
it
would
take
one
of
very
uncommon
characteristics
i
own
pish
i
cried
not
so
very
indeed
i
think
you
have
not
fully
taken
in
the
case
he
urged
in
quiet
superiority
the
people
there
are
of
the
higher
order
of
country
folk
many
of
them
are
of
extreme
refinement
one
family
here
his
tone
changed
a
trifle
is
poor
enough
and
cultivated
enough
to
interest
even
such
a
woman
as
yourself
indeed
i
ejaculated
with
just
a
touch
of
my
father
hauteur
to
hide
the
stir
of
curiosity
his
words
naturally
evoked
it
is
in
some
such
home
he
continued
with
an
ease
that
should
have
warned
me
he
had
started
on
this
pursuit
with
a
quiet
determination
to
win
that
the
clue
will
be
found
to
the
mystery
we
are
considering
yes
you
may
well
look
startled
but
that
conclusion
is
the
one
thing
i
brought
away
with
me
from
let
us
say
i
regard
it
as
one
of
some
moment
what
do
you
think
of
it
well
i
admitted
it
makes
me
feel
like
recalling
that
i
uttered
a
few
minutes
ago
it
would
take
a
woman
of
uncommon
characteristics
to
assist
you
in
this
matter
i
am
glad
we
have
got
that
far
said
he
a
lady
i
went
on
most
assuredly
a
lady
i
paused
sometimes
discreet
silence
is
more
sarcastic
than
speech
well
what
lady
would
lend
herself
to
this
scheme
i
demanded
at
last
the
tap
tap
of
his
fingers
on
the
rim
of
his
glasses
was
my
only
answer
i
do
not
know
of
any
said
i
his
eyebrows
rose
perhaps
a
but
i
noted
the
implied
sarcasm
and
for
an
instant
forgot
my
dignity
now
said
i
this
will
not
do
you
mean
me
amelia
butterworth
a
woman
who
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
tell
you
either
who
or
what
i
am
you
have
presumed
sir
now
do
not
put
on
that
look
of
innocence
and
above
all
do
not
attempt
to
deny
what
is
so
manifestly
in
your
thoughts
for
that
would
make
me
feel
like
showing
you
the
door
then
he
smiled
i
shall
be
sure
to
deny
nothing
i
am
not
anxious
to
leave
yet
besides
whom
could
i
mean
but
you
a
lady
visiting
friends
in
this
remote
and
beautiful
region
what
opportunities
might
she
not
have
to
probe
this
important
mystery
if
like
yourself
she
had
tact
discretion
excellent
understanding
and
an
experience
which
if
not
broad
or
deep
is
certainly
such
as
to
give
her
a
certain
confidence
in
herself
and
an
undoubted
influence
with
the
man
fortunate
enough
to
receive
her
advice
bah
i
exclaimed
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
expressions
that
was
perhaps
why
i
used
it
one
would
think
i
was
a
member
of
your
police
you
flatter
us
too
deeply
was
his
deferential
answer
such
an
honor
as
that
would
be
beyond
our
deserts
to
this
i
gave
but
the
faintest
sniff
that
he
should
think
that
i
amelia
butterworth
could
be
amenable
to
such
barefaced
flattery
then
i
faced
him
with
some
asperity
and
said
bluntly
you
waste
your
time
i
have
no
more
intention
of
meddling
in
another
affair
than
you
had
in
meddling
in
the
first
he
politely
too
politely
interpolated
i
understand
madam
i
was
angry
but
made
no
show
of
being
so
i
was
not
willing
he
should
see
that
i
could
be
affected
by
anything
he
could
say
the
van
burnams
are
my
neighbors
i
remarked
sweetly
i
had
the
best
of
excuses
for
the
interest
i
took
in
their
affairs
so
you
had
he
acquiesced
i
am
glad
to
be
reminded
of
the
fact
i
wonder
i
was
able
to
forget
it
angry
now
to
the
point
of
not
being
able
to
hide
it
i
turned
upon
him
with
firm
determination
let
us
talk
of
something
else
i
said
but
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
drawing
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
he
opened
it
out
before
my
eyes
observing
quite
naturally
that
is
a
happy
thought
let
us
look
over
this
sketch
you
were
sharp
enough
to
ask
for
a
few
moments
ago
it
shows
the
streets
of
the
village
and
the
places
where
each
of
the
persons
i
have
mentioned
was
last
seen
is
not
that
what
you
wanted
i
know
that
i
should
have
drawn
back
with
a
frown
that
i
never
should
have
allowed
myself
the
satisfaction
of
casting
so
much
as
a
glance
toward
the
paper
but
the
human
nature
which
links
me
to
my
kind
was
too
much
for
me
and
with
an
involuntary
exactly
i
leaned
over
it
with
an
eagerness
i
strove
hard
even
at
that
exciting
moment
to
keep
within
the
bounds
i
thought
proper
to
my
position
as
a
interested
in
the
matter
from
curiosity
alone
this
is
what
i
saw
illustration
gryce
said
i
after
a
few
minutes
close
contemplation
of
this
diagram
i
do
not
suppose
you
want
any
opinion
from
me
madam
he
retorted
it
is
all
you
have
left
me
free
to
ask
for
receiving
this
as
a
permission
to
speak
i
put
my
finger
on
the
road
marked
with
a
cross
then
said
i
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
this
drawing
all
the
disappearances
seem
to
have
taken
place
in
or
about
this
especial
road
you
are
as
correct
as
usual
he
returned
what
you
have
said
is
so
true
that
the
people
of
the
vicinity
have
already
given
to
this
winding
way
a
special
cognomen
of
its
own
for
two
years
now
it
has
been
called
lost
man
lane
indeed
i
cried
they
have
got
the
matter
down
as
close
as
that
and
yet
have
not
solved
its
mystery
how
long
is
this
road
a
half
mile
or
so
i
must
have
looked
my
disgust
for
his
hands
opened
deprecatingly
the
ground
has
undergone
a
thorough
search
said
he
not
a
square
foot
in
those
woods
you
see
on
either
side
of
the
road
but
has
been
carefully
examined
and
the
houses
i
see
there
are
three
houses
on
this
road
oh
they
are
owned
by
most
respectable
people
respectable
people
he
repeated
with
a
lingering
emphasis
that
gave
me
an
inward
shudder
i
think
i
had
the
honor
of
intimating
as
much
to
you
a
few
minutes
ago
i
looked
at
him
earnestly
and
irresistibly
drew
a
little
nearer
to
him
over
the
diagram
have
none
of
these
houses
been
visited
by
you
i
asked
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
not
seen
the
inside
of
them
all
oh
he
replied
i
have
been
in
them
all
of
course
but
a
mystery
such
as
we
are
investigating
is
not
written
upon
the
walls
of
parlors
or
halls
you
freeze
my
blood
was
my
uncharacteristic
rejoinder
somehow
the
sight
of
the
homes
indicated
on
this
diagram
seemed
to
bring
me
into
more
intimate
sympathy
with
the
affair
his
shrug
was
significant
i
told
you
that
this
was
no
vulgar
mystery
he
declared
or
why
should
i
be
considering
it
with
it
is
quite
worthy
of
your
interest
do
you
see
that
house
marked
a
i
do
i
nodded
well
that
is
a
decayed
mansion
of
imposing
proportions
set
in
a
forest
of
overgrown
shrubbery
the
ladies
who
inhabit
it
ladies
i
put
in
with
a
small
shock
of
horror
young
ladies
he
explained
of
a
refined
if
not
appearance
they
are
the
interesting
residue
of
a
family
of
some
repute
their
father
was
a
judge
i
believe
and
do
they
live
there
alone
i
asked
two
young
ladies
in
a
house
so
large
and
in
a
neighborhood
so
full
of
mystery
oh
they
have
a
brother
with
them
a
lout
of
no
great
attractions
he
responded
carelessly
too
carelessly
i
thought
i
made
a
note
of
the
house
a
in
my
mind
and
who
lives
in
the
house
marked
b
i
now
queried
a
trohm
you
will
remember
that
it
was
through
his
exertions
the
services
of
the
new
york
police
were
secured
his
place
there
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
town
and
he
does
not
wish
to
be
forced
to
leave
it
but
he
will
be
obliged
to
do
so
if
the
road
is
not
soon
relieved
of
its
bad
name
and
so
will
deacon
spear
the
very
children
shun
the
road
now
i
do
not
know
of
a
lonelier
place
i
see
a
little
mark
made
here
on
the
verge
of
the
woods
what
does
that
mean
that
stands
for
a
hut
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
cottage
where
a
poor
old
woman
lives
called
mother
jane
she
is
a
harmless
imbecile
against
whom
no
one
has
ever
directed
a
suspicion
you
may
take
your
finger
off
that
mark
miss
butterworth
i
did
so
but
i
did
not
forget
that
it
stood
very
near
the
footpath
branching
off
to
the
station
you
entered
this
hut
as
well
as
the
big
houses
i
intimated
and
found
was
his
answer
four
walls
nothing
more
i
let
my
finger
travel
along
the
footpath
i
have
just
mentioned
steep
was
his
comment
up
up
all
the
way
but
no
precipices
nothing
but
pine
woods
on
either
side
thickly
carpeted
with
needles
my
finger
came
back
and
stopped
at
the
house
marked
why
is
a
letter
affixed
to
this
spot
i
asked
because
it
stands
at
the
head
of
the
lane
any
one
sitting
at
the
window
l
can
see
whoever
enters
or
leaves
the
lane
at
this
end
and
some
one
is
always
sitting
there
the
house
contains
two
crippled
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
one
of
them
is
always
in
that
window
i
see
said
i
then
abruptly
what
do
you
think
of
deacon
spear
oh
he
a
man
none
too
fine
in
his
feelings
he
does
not
mind
the
neighborhood
likes
quiet
he
says
i
hope
you
will
know
him
for
yourself
some
day
the
detective
slyly
added
at
this
return
to
the
forbidden
subject
i
held
myself
very
much
aloof
your
diagram
is
interesting
i
remarked
but
it
has
not
in
the
least
changed
my
determination
it
is
you
who
will
return
to
and
that
very
soon
very
soon
he
repeated
whoever
goes
there
on
this
errand
must
go
at
once
if
possible
if
not
at
the
latest
i
expostulated
and
you
thought
no
matter
what
i
thought
he
sighed
it
seems
i
had
no
reason
for
my
hopes
and
folding
up
the
map
he
slowly
rose
the
young
man
we
have
left
there
is
doing
more
harm
than
good
that
is
why
i
say
that
some
one
of
real
ability
must
replace
him
immediately
the
detective
from
new
york
must
seem
to
have
left
the
place
i
made
him
my
most
ladylike
bow
of
dismissal
i
shall
watch
the
papers
i
said
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
soon
be
gratified
by
seeing
in
them
some
token
of
your
success
he
cast
a
rueful
look
at
his
hands
took
a
painful
step
toward
the
door
and
dolefully
shook
his
head
i
kept
my
silence
undisturbed
he
took
another
painful
step
then
turned
by
the
way
he
remarked
as
i
stood
watching
him
with
an
uncompromising
air
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
these
disappearances
have
occurred
it
is
called
and
it
is
to
be
found
on
one
of
the
spurs
of
the
berkshire
hills
and
being
by
this
time
at
the
door
he
bowed
himself
out
with
all
the
insinuating
suavity
which
distinguishes
him
at
certain
critical
moments
the
old
fox
was
so
sure
of
his
triumph
that
he
did
not
wait
to
witness
it
he
knew
how
it
is
easy
enough
for
me
to
understand
now
that
was
a
place
i
had
often
threatened
to
visit
the
family
of
one
of
my
dearest
friends
lived
there
the
children
of
althea
knollys
she
had
been
my
chum
at
school
and
when
she
died
i
had
promised
myself
not
to
let
many
months
go
by
without
making
the
acquaintance
of
her
children
alas
i
had
allowed
years
to
elapse
iii
i
succumb
that
night
the
tempter
had
his
own
way
with
me
without
much
difficulty
he
persuaded
me
that
my
neglect
of
althea
burroughs
children
was
without
any
excuse
that
what
had
been
my
duty
toward
them
when
i
knew
them
to
be
left
motherless
and
alone
had
become
an
imperative
demand
upon
me
now
that
the
town
in
which
they
lived
had
become
overshadowed
by
a
mystery
which
could
not
but
affect
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
all
its
inhabitants
i
could
not
wait
a
day
i
recalled
all
that
i
had
heard
of
poor
althea
short
and
none
too
happy
marriage
and
immediately
felt
such
a
burning
desire
to
see
if
her
dainty
but
spirited
beauty
how
well
i
remembered
it
had
been
repeated
in
her
daughters
that
i
found
myself
packing
my
trunk
before
i
knew
it
i
had
not
been
from
home
for
a
long
time
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
have
a
change
now
and
when
i
notified
randolph
and
the
servants
of
my
intention
of
leaving
on
the
early
morning
train
it
created
quite
a
sensation
in
the
house
but
i
had
the
best
of
explanations
to
offer
i
had
been
thinking
of
my
dead
friend
and
my
conscience
would
not
let
me
neglect
her
dear
and
possibly
unhappy
progeny
any
longer
i
had
purposed
many
times
to
visit
and
now
i
was
going
to
do
it
when
i
come
to
a
decision
it
is
usually
suddenly
and
i
never
rest
after
having
once
made
up
my
mind
my
sentiment
went
so
far
that
i
got
down
an
old
album
and
began
hunting
up
the
pictures
i
had
brought
away
with
me
from
hers
was
among
them
and
i
really
did
experience
more
or
less
compunction
when
i
saw
again
the
delicate
yet
daring
features
which
had
once
had
a
very
great
influence
over
my
mind
what
a
teasing
sprite
she
was
yet
what
a
will
she
had
and
how
strange
it
was
that
having
been
so
intimate
as
girls
we
never
knew
anything
of
each
other
as
women
had
it
been
her
fault
or
mine
was
her
marriage
to
blame
for
it
or
my
spinsterhood
difficult
to
tell
then
impossible
to
tell
now
i
would
not
even
think
of
it
again
save
as
a
warning
nothing
must
stand
between
me
and
her
children
now
that
my
attention
has
been
called
to
them
again
i
did
not
mean
to
take
them
by
surprise
that
is
not
entirely
the
invitation
which
they
had
sent
me
years
ago
was
still
in
force
making
it
simply
necessary
for
me
to
telegraph
them
that
i
had
decided
to
make
them
a
visit
and
that
they
might
expect
me
by
the
noon
train
if
in
times
gone
by
they
had
been
properly
instructed
by
their
mother
in
regard
to
the
character
of
her
old
friend
this
need
not
put
them
out
i
am
not
a
woman
of
unbounded
expectations
i
do
not
look
for
the
comforts
abroad
i
am
accustomed
to
find
at
home
and
if
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
their
means
are
not
of
the
greatest
they
would
only
provoke
me
by
any
show
of
effort
to
make
me
feel
at
home
in
the
humble
cottage
suited
to
their
fortunes
so
the
telegram
was
sent
and
my
preparations
completed
for
an
early
departure
but
resolved
as
i
was
to
make
this
visit
my
determination
came
near
receiving
a
check
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
at
the
very
moment
in
fact
when
the
hackman
was
carrying
out
my
trunk
i
perceived
a
man
approaching
me
with
every
evidence
of
haste
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
which
he
held
out
to
me
as
soon
as
he
came
within
reach
for
miss
butterworth
he
announced
private
and
immediate
ah
thought
i
a
communication
from
gryce
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
whether
to
open
it
on
the
spot
or
to
wait
and
read
it
at
my
leisure
on
the
cars
the
latter
course
promised
me
less
inconvenience
than
the
first
for
my
hands
were
cumbered
with
the
various
small
articles
i
consider
indispensable
to
the
comfortable
enjoyment
of
the
shortest
journey
and
the
glasses
without
which
i
can
not
read
a
word
were
in
the
very
bottom
of
my
pocket
under
many
other
equally
necessary
articles
but
something
in
the
man
expectant
look
warned
me
that
he
would
never
leave
me
till
i
had
read
the
note
so
with
a
sigh
i
called
lena
to
my
aid
and
after
several
vain
attempts
to
reach
my
glasses
succeeded
at
last
in
pulling
them
out
and
by
their
help
reading
the
following
hurried
lines
dear
madam
i
send
you
this
by
a
swifter
messenger
than
myself
do
not
let
anything
that
i
may
have
said
last
night
influence
you
to
leave
your
comfortable
home
the
adventure
offers
too
many
dangers
for
a
woman
read
the
inclosed
the
inclosed
was
a
telegram
from
sent
during
the
night
and
evidently
just
received
at
headquarters
its
contents
were
certainly
not
reassuring
another
person
missing
last
seen
in
lost
man
lane
a
harmless
lad
known
as
silly
rufus
what
to
be
done
wire
orders
trohm
gryce
bade
me
say
that
he
would
be
up
here
some
time
before
noon
said
the
man
seeing
me
look
with
some
blankness
at
these
words
nothing
more
was
needed
to
restore
my
folding
up
the
letter
i
put
it
in
my
bag
say
to
gryce
from
me
that
my
intended
visit
can
not
be
postponed
i
replied
i
have
telegraphed
to
my
friends
to
expect
me
and
only
a
great
emergency
would
lead
me
to
disappoint
them
i
will
be
glad
to
receive
gryce
on
my
return
and
without
further
parley
i
took
my
bundles
back
from
lena
and
proceeded
at
once
to
the
carriage
why
should
i
show
any
failure
of
courage
at
an
event
that
was
but
a
repetition
of
the
very
ones
which
made
my
visit
necessary
was
i
a
likely
person
to
fall
victim
to
a
mystery
to
which
my
eyes
had
been
opened
had
i
not
been
sufficiently
warned
of
the
dangers
of
lost
lane
to
keep
myself
at
a
respectable
distance
from
the
place
of
peril
i
was
going
to
visit
the
children
of
my
once
devoted
friend
if
there
were
perils
of
no
ordinary
nature
to
be
encountered
in
so
doing
was
i
not
all
the
more
called
upon
to
lend
them
the
support
of
my
presence
yes
gryce
and
nothing
now
should
hold
me
back
i
even
felt
an
increased
desire
to
reach
the
scene
of
these
mysteries
and
chafed
some
at
the
length
of
the
journey
which
was
of
a
more
tedious
character
than
i
expected
a
poor
beginning
for
events
requiring
patience
as
well
as
great
moral
courage
but
i
little
knew
what
was
before
me
and
only
considered
that
every
moment
spent
on
this
hot
and
dusty
train
kept
me
thus
much
longer
from
the
embraces
of
althea
children
i
recovered
my
equanimity
however
as
we
approached
x
the
scenery
was
really
beautiful
and
the
consciousness
that
i
should
soon
alight
at
the
mountain
station
which
had
played
a
more
or
less
serious
part
in
gryce
narrative
awakened
in
me
a
pleasurable
excitement
which
should
have
been
a
sufficient
warning
to
me
that
the
spirit
of
investigation
which
had
led
me
so
triumphantly
through
that
affair
next
door
had
seized
me
again
in
a
way
that
meant
equal
absorption
if
not
equal
success
the
number
of
small
packages
i
carried
gave
me
enough
to
think
of
at
the
moment
of
alighting
but
as
soon
as
i
was
safely
again
on
terra
firma
i
threw
a
hasty
glance
around
to
see
if
any
of
althea
children
were
on
hand
to
meet
me
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
know
them
at
first
glance
their
mother
had
been
so
characteristically
pretty
she
could
not
have
failed
to
transmit
some
of
her
most
charming
traits
to
her
offspring
but
while
there
were
two
or
three
country
maidens
to
be
seen
standing
in
and
around
the
little
pavilion
known
here
as
the
i
saw
no
one
who
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
could
be
regarded
as
of
althea
burroughs
blood
or
breeding
somewhat
disappointed
for
i
had
expected
different
results
from
my
telegram
i
stepped
up
to
the
and
asked
him
whether
i
would
have
any
difficulty
in
procuring
a
carriage
to
take
me
to
miss
knollys
house
he
stared
it
seemed
to
me
unnecessarily
long
before
replying
waal
said
he
simmons
is
usually
here
but
i
do
see
him
around
perhaps
some
of
these
farmer
lads
will
drive
you
in
but
they
all
drew
back
with
a
scared
look
and
i
was
beginning
to
tuck
up
my
skirts
preparatory
to
walking
when
a
little
old
man
of
exceedingly
meek
appearance
drove
up
in
a
very
coach
and
with
a
hesitating
air
springing
entirely
from
bashfulness
managed
to
ask
if
i
was
miss
butterworth
i
hastened
to
assure
him
that
i
was
that
lady
whereupon
he
stammered
out
some
words
about
miss
knollys
and
how
sorry
she
was
that
she
could
not
come
for
me
herself
then
he
pointed
to
his
coach
and
made
me
understand
that
i
was
to
step
into
it
and
go
with
him
this
i
had
not
counted
upon
doing
for
i
desired
to
both
see
and
hear
as
much
as
possible
before
reaching
my
destination
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it
to
his
astonishment
i
insisted
that
my
belongings
be
put
inside
the
coach
while
i
rode
on
the
box
it
was
an
inauspicious
beginning
to
a
very
doubtful
adventure
i
understood
this
when
i
saw
the
heads
of
the
various
onlookers
draw
together
and
many
curious
looks
directed
at
both
us
and
the
conveyance
that
was
to
carry
us
but
i
was
in
no
mood
to
be
daunted
now
and
mounting
to
the
box
with
what
grace
i
could
prepared
myself
for
a
ride
into
town
but
it
seems
i
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
spot
without
another
warning
while
the
old
man
was
engaged
in
fetching
my
trunk
the
approached
me
with
great
civility
and
asked
if
it
was
my
intention
to
spend
a
few
days
with
the
misses
knollys
i
told
him
that
it
was
and
thinking
it
best
to
establish
my
position
at
once
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
town
added
with
a
politeness
equal
to
his
own
that
i
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
had
been
coming
to
visit
them
for
years
but
had
never
found
it
convenient
till
now
and
that
i
hoped
they
were
all
well
and
would
be
glad
to
see
me
his
reply
showed
considerable
embarrassment
perhaps
you
have
not
heard
that
this
village
is
under
a
cloud
just
now
i
have
heard
that
one
or
two
men
have
disappeared
from
here
somewhat
mysteriously
i
returned
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
one
person
a
boy
disappeared
only
two
days
ago
that
bad
i
said
but
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
i
smilingly
added
for
i
saw
that
he
was
not
at
the
end
of
his
talk
oh
nothing
he
eagerly
replied
only
i
did
know
but
you
might
be
timid
oh
i
not
at
all
timid
i
hastened
to
interject
if
i
were
i
should
not
have
come
here
at
all
such
matters
do
affect
me
and
i
spread
out
my
skirts
and
arranged
myself
for
my
ride
with
as
much
care
and
precision
as
if
the
horrors
he
had
mentioned
had
made
no
more
impression
upon
me
than
if
his
chat
had
been
of
the
weather
perhaps
i
overdid
it
for
he
looked
at
me
for
another
moment
in
a
curious
lingering
way
then
he
walked
off
and
i
saw
him
enter
the
circle
of
gossips
on
the
platform
where
he
stood
shaking
his
head
as
long
as
we
were
within
sight
my
companion
who
was
the
shyest
man
i
ever
saw
did
not
speak
a
word
while
we
were
descending
the
hill
i
talked
and
endeavored
to
make
him
follow
my
example
but
his
replies
were
mere
grunts
or
which
conveyed
no
information
whatever
as
we
cleared
the
thicket
however
he
allowed
himself
an
ejaculation
or
two
as
he
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
and
indeed
it
was
well
worth
his
admiration
and
mine
had
my
mind
been
free
to
enjoy
it
but
the
houses
which
now
began
to
appear
on
either
side
of
the
way
drew
my
attention
from
the
mountains
though
still
somewhat
remote
from
the
town
we
were
rapidly
approaching
the
head
of
that
lane
of
evil
fame
with
whose
history
my
thoughts
were
at
this
time
full
i
was
so
anxious
not
to
pass
it
without
one
look
into
its
grewsome
recesses
that
i
kept
my
head
persistently
turned
that
way
till
i
felt
i
was
attracting
the
attention
of
my
companion
as
this
was
not
desirable
i
put
on
a
nonchalant
look
and
began
chatting
about
what
i
saw
but
he
had
lapsed
into
his
early
silence
and
seemed
wholly
engrossed
in
his
attempt
to
remove
with
the
of
his
whip
a
bit
of
rag
which
had
somehow
become
entangled
in
the
spokes
of
one
of
the
front
wheels
the
furtive
look
he
cast
me
as
he
succeeded
in
doing
this
struck
me
oddly
at
the
moment
but
it
was
too
small
a
matter
to
hold
my
attention
long
or
to
cause
any
cessation
in
the
flow
of
small
talk
with
which
i
was
endeavoring
to
enliven
the
situation
my
desire
for
conversation
lagged
however
as
i
saw
rising
up
before
us
the
dark
boughs
of
a
pine
thicket
we
were
nearing
lost
man
lane
we
were
abreast
of
it
we
were
yes
we
were
turning
into
it
i
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
dismay
where
are
we
going
i
asked
to
miss
knollys
house
he
found
words
to
say
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
me
full
of
uneasy
inquiry
do
they
live
on
this
road
i
cried
remembering
with
a
certain
shock
gryce
suspicious
description
of
the
two
young
ladies
who
with
their
brother
inhabited
the
dilapidated
mansion
marked
a
in
the
map
he
had
shown
me
where
else
was
his
laconic
answer
and
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
this
curtest
of
curt
replies
i
drew
myself
up
with
just
one
longing
look
behind
me
at
the
cheerful
highway
we
were
so
rapidly
leaving
a
cottage
with
an
open
window
in
which
a
child
head
could
be
seen
nodding
eagerly
toward
me
met
my
eyes
and
filled
me
with
quite
an
odd
sense
of
discomfort
as
i
realized
that
i
had
caught
the
attention
of
one
of
the
little
cripples
who
according
to
gryce
always
kept
watch
over
this
entrance
into
lost
man
lane
another
moment
and
the
pine
branches
had
shut
the
vision
out
but
i
did
not
soon
forget
that
eager
childish
face
and
pointing
hand
marking
me
out
as
a
possible
victim
to
the
horrors
of
this
lane
but
i
was
aware
of
no
secret
flinching
from
the
adventure
into
which
i
was
plunging
on
the
contrary
i
felt
a
strange
and
fierce
delight
in
thus
being
thrust
into
the
very
heart
of
the
mystery
i
had
only
expected
to
approach
by
degrees
the
warning
message
sent
me
by
gryce
had
acquired
a
deeper
and
more
significant
meaning
as
did
the
looks
which
had
been
cast
me
by
the
and
his
gossips
on
the
hillside
but
in
my
present
mood
these
very
tokens
of
the
serious
nature
of
my
undertaking
only
gave
an
added
spur
to
my
courage
i
felt
my
brain
clear
and
my
heart
expand
as
if
at
this
moment
before
i
had
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
the
faces
of
these
young
people
i
recognized
the
fact
that
they
were
the
victims
of
a
web
of
circumstances
so
tragic
and
incomprehensible
that
only
a
woman
like
myself
would
be
able
to
dissipate
them
and
restore
these
girls
to
the
confidence
of
the
people
around
them
i
forgot
that
these
girls
had
a
brother
and
that
but
not
a
word
to
forestall
the
truth
i
wish
this
story
to
grow
upon
you
just
as
it
did
upon
me
and
with
just
as
little
preparation
the
farmer
who
drove
me
and
who
i
afterwards
learned
was
called
simsbury
showed
a
certain
dogged
interest
in
my
behavior
that
would
have
amused
me
or
at
least
have
awakened
my
disdain
under
circumstances
of
a
less
thrilling
nature
i
saw
his
eye
roll
in
a
sort
of
wonder
over
my
person
which
may
have
been
held
a
little
more
stiffly
than
was
necessary
and
settle
finally
on
my
face
with
a
look
i
might
have
thought
complimentary
had
i
had
any
thought
to
bestow
on
such
matters
not
till
we
had
passed
the
path
branching
up
through
the
woods
toward
the
mountain
did
he
see
fit
to
withdraw
it
nor
did
i
fail
to
find
it
fixed
again
upon
me
as
we
rode
by
the
little
hut
occupied
by
the
old
woman
considered
so
harmless
by
gryce
perhaps
he
had
a
reason
for
this
as
i
was
very
much
interested
in
this
hut
and
its
occupant
about
whom
i
felt
free
to
cherish
my
own
secret
doubts
so
interested
that
i
cast
it
a
very
sharp
glance
and
was
glad
when
i
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
doorway
of
the
old
crone
mumbling
over
a
piece
of
bread
she
was
engaged
in
eating
as
we
passed
her
that
mother
jane
explained
my
companion
breaking
the
silence
of
many
minutes
and
yonder
is
miss
knollys
house
he
added
lifting
his
whip
and
pointing
toward
the
façade
of
a
large
and
pretentious
dwelling
a
few
rods
farther
on
down
the
road
she
will
be
powerful
glad
to
see
you
miss
company
is
scarce
in
these
parts
astonished
at
this
sudden
launch
into
conversation
by
one
whose
reserve
i
had
hitherto
found
it
impossible
to
penetrate
i
gave
him
the
affable
answer
he
evidently
expected
and
then
looked
eagerly
toward
the
house
it
was
as
gryce
had
intimated
exceedingly
forbidding
even
at
that
distance
and
as
we
approached
nearer
and
i
was
given
a
full
view
of
its
worn
and
discolored
front
i
felt
myself
forced
to
acknowledge
that
never
in
my
life
had
my
eyes
fallen
upon
a
habitation
more
given
over
to
neglect
or
less
promising
in
its
hospitality
had
it
not
been
for
the
thin
circle
of
smoke
eddying
up
from
one
of
its
broken
chimneys
i
would
have
looked
upon
the
place
as
one
which
had
not
known
the
care
or
presence
of
man
for
years
there
was
a
riot
of
shrubbery
in
the
yard
a
lack
of
the
commonest
attention
to
order
in
the
way
the
vines
drooped
in
tangled
masses
over
the
face
of
the
desolate
porch
that
gave
to
the
broken
pilasters
and
decayed
of
this
dreariest
of
façades
that
look
of
abandonment
which
only
becomes
picturesque
when
nature
has
usurped
the
prerogative
of
man
and
taken
entirely
to
herself
the
empty
walls
and
falling
casements
of
what
was
once
a
human
dwelling
that
any
one
should
be
living
in
it
now
and
that
i
who
have
never
been
able
to
see
a
chair
standing
crooked
or
a
curtain
awry
without
a
sensation
of
the
keenest
discomfort
should
be
on
the
point
of
deliberately
entering
its
doors
as
an
inmate
filled
me
at
the
moment
with
such
a
sense
of
unreality
that
i
descended
from
the
carriage
in
a
sort
of
a
dream
and
was
making
my
way
through
one
of
the
gaps
in
the
high
antique
fence
that
separated
the
yard
from
the
gateway
when
simsbury
stopped
me
and
pointed
out
the
gate
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
apologize
for
my
mistake
for
the
broken
palings
certainly
offered
as
good
an
entrance
as
the
gate
which
had
slipped
from
its
hinges
and
hung
but
a
few
inches
open
but
i
took
the
course
he
indicated
holding
up
my
skirts
and
treading
gingerly
for
fear
of
the
snails
and
toads
that
incumbered
such
portions
of
the
path
as
the
weeds
had
left
visible
as
i
proceeded
on
my
way
something
in
the
silence
of
the
spot
struck
me
was
i
becoming
to
impressions
or
was
there
something
really
uncanny
in
the
absolute
lack
of
sound
or
movement
in
a
dwelling
of
such
dimensions
but
i
should
not
have
said
movement
for
at
that
instant
i
saw
a
flash
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
as
of
a
curtain
being
stealthily
drawn
and
as
stealthily
let
fall
again
and
though
it
gave
me
the
promise
of
some
sort
of
greeting
there
was
a
furtiveness
in
the
action
so
in
keeping
with
the
suspicions
of
gryce
that
i
felt
my
nerves
braced
at
once
to
mount
the
steps
that
led
to
the
front
door
but
no
sooner
had
i
done
this
with
what
i
am
fain
to
consider
my
best
air
than
i
suddenly
collapsed
with
what
i
am
bound
to
regard
as
a
comprehensible
and
quite
excusable
fear
for
while
i
do
not
quail
before
men
and
have
a
reasonable
fortitude
in
the
presence
of
most
dangers
corporeal
and
moral
i
am
not
quite
myself
in
face
of
a
rampant
and
barking
dog
it
is
my
one
weakness
and
while
i
usually
can
and
under
most
circumstances
do
succeed
in
hiding
my
inner
trepidation
under
the
emergency
just
mentioned
i
always
feel
that
it
would
be
a
happy
relief
for
me
if
the
day
should
ever
come
when
these
domestic
animals
would
be
banished
from
the
affections
and
homes
of
men
then
i
think
i
would
begin
to
live
in
good
earnest
and
perhaps
enjoy
trips
into
the
country
which
now
for
all
my
apparent
bravery
i
regard
more
in
the
light
of
a
penance
than
a
pleasure
imagine
then
how
hard
i
found
it
to
retain
my
or
even
any
appearance
of
dignity
when
at
the
moment
i
was
stretching
forth
my
hand
toward
the
knocker
of
this
inhospitable
mansion
i
heard
rising
from
some
unknown
quarter
a
howl
so
keen
piercing
and
prolonged
that
it
frightened
the
very
birds
over
my
head
and
sent
them
flying
from
the
vines
in
clouds
it
was
the
unhappiest
kind
of
welcome
for
me
i
did
not
know
whether
it
came
from
within
or
without
and
when
after
a
moment
of
indecision
i
saw
the
door
open
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
smile
i
called
up
to
grace
the
occasion
had
any
of
the
real
amelia
butterworth
in
it
so
much
was
my
mind
divided
between
a
desire
to
produce
a
favorable
impression
and
a
very
decided
and
fear
of
the
dog
who
had
greeted
my
arrival
with
such
an
ominous
howl
call
off
the
dog
i
cried
almost
before
i
saw
what
sort
of
person
i
was
addressing
gryce
when
i
saw
him
later
declared
this
to
be
the
most
significant
introduction
i
could
have
made
of
myself
upon
entering
the
knollys
mansion
iv
a
ghostly
interior
the
hall
into
which
i
had
stepped
was
so
dark
that
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
indistinct
outline
of
a
young
woman
with
a
very
white
face
she
had
uttered
some
sort
of
murmur
at
my
words
but
for
some
reason
was
strangely
silent
and
if
i
could
trust
my
eyes
seemed
rather
to
be
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
than
into
the
face
of
her
advancing
guest
this
was
odd
but
before
i
could
quite
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
cause
of
her
abstraction
she
suddenly
bethought
herself
and
throwing
open
the
door
of
an
adjoining
room
let
in
a
stream
of
light
by
which
we
were
enabled
to
see
each
other
and
exchange
the
greetings
suitable
to
the
occasion
miss
butterworth
my
mother
old
friend
she
murmured
with
an
almost
pitiful
effort
to
be
cordial
we
are
so
glad
to
have
you
visit
us
wo
you
wo
you
sit
down
what
did
it
mean
she
had
pointed
to
a
chair
in
the
but
her
face
was
turned
away
again
as
if
drawn
irresistibly
toward
some
secret
object
of
dread
was
there
anyone
or
anything
at
the
top
of
the
dim
staircase
i
could
faintly
see
in
the
distance
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
ask
nor
was
it
wise
for
me
to
show
that
i
thought
this
reception
a
strange
one
stepping
into
the
room
she
pointed
out
i
waited
for
her
to
follow
me
which
she
did
with
manifest
reluctance
but
when
she
was
once
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
hall
or
out
of
reach
of
the
sight
or
sound
of
whatever
it
was
that
frightened
her
her
face
took
on
a
smile
that
ingratiated
her
with
me
at
once
and
gave
to
her
very
delicate
aspect
which
up
to
that
moment
had
not
suggested
the
remotest
likeness
to
her
mother
a
piquant
charm
and
subtle
fascination
that
were
not
unworthy
of
the
daughter
of
althea
burroughs
you
must
not
mind
the
poverty
of
your
welcome
she
said
with
a
look
around
her
which
i
must
say
the
bareness
and
shabby
character
of
the
room
we
were
in
fully
justified
we
have
not
been
very
well
off
since
father
died
and
mother
left
us
had
you
given
us
a
chance
we
should
have
written
you
that
our
home
would
not
offer
many
inducements
to
you
after
your
own
but
you
have
come
unexpectedly
and
there
there
i
put
in
for
i
saw
that
her
embarrassment
would
soon
get
the
better
of
her
do
not
speak
of
it
i
did
not
come
to
enjoy
your
home
but
to
see
you
are
you
the
eldest
my
dear
and
where
are
your
sister
and
brother
i
am
not
the
eldest
she
said
i
am
lucetta
my
sister
here
her
head
stole
irresistibly
back
to
its
old
position
of
listening
will
will
come
soon
my
brother
is
not
in
the
house
well
said
i
astonished
that
she
did
not
ask
me
to
take
off
my
things
you
are
a
pretty
girl
but
you
do
not
look
very
strong
are
you
quite
well
my
dear
she
started
looked
at
me
eagerly
almost
anxiously
for
a
moment
then
straightened
herself
and
began
to
lose
some
of
her
abstraction
i
am
not
a
strong
person
she
smiled
but
neither
am
i
so
very
weak
either
i
was
always
small
so
was
my
mother
you
know
i
was
glad
to
have
her
talk
of
her
mother
i
therefore
answered
her
in
a
way
to
prolong
the
conversation
yes
your
mother
was
small
i
admitted
but
never
thin
or
pallid
she
was
like
a
fairy
among
us
schoolgirls
does
it
seem
odd
to
hear
so
old
a
woman
as
i
speak
of
herself
as
a
schoolgirl
oh
no
she
said
but
there
was
no
heart
in
her
voice
i
had
almost
forgotten
those
days
till
i
happened
to
hear
the
name
of
althea
mentioned
the
other
day
i
proceeded
seeing
i
must
keep
up
the
conversation
if
we
were
not
to
sit
in
total
silence
then
my
early
friendship
with
your
mother
recurred
to
me
and
i
started
up
as
i
always
do
when
i
come
to
any
decision
my
dear
and
sent
that
telegram
which
i
hope
i
have
not
followed
by
an
unwelcome
presence
oh
no
she
repeated
but
this
time
with
some
feeling
we
need
friends
and
if
you
will
overlook
our
shortcomings
but
you
have
not
taken
off
your
hat
what
will
loreen
say
to
me
and
with
a
sudden
nervous
action
as
marked
as
her
late
listlessness
she
jumped
up
and
began
busying
herself
over
me
untying
my
bonnet
and
laying
aside
my
bundles
which
up
to
this
moment
i
had
held
in
my
hands
i
i
am
so
she
murmured
i
i
did
not
think
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
loreen
would
have
given
you
a
much
better
welcome
then
loreen
should
have
been
here
i
said
with
a
smile
i
could
not
restrain
this
slight
rebuke
yet
i
liked
the
girl
notwithstanding
everything
i
had
heard
and
her
own
odd
and
unaccountable
behavior
there
was
a
sweetness
in
her
face
when
she
chose
to
smile
that
proved
an
irresistible
attraction
and
then
for
all
her
and
abstracted
ways
she
was
such
a
lady
her
plain
dress
her
restrained
manner
could
not
hide
this
fact
it
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
her
thin
but
graceful
form
and
in
every
inflection
of
her
musical
but
constrained
voice
had
i
seen
her
in
my
own
parlor
instead
of
between
these
bare
and
moldering
walls
i
should
have
said
the
same
thing
she
is
such
a
lady
but
this
only
passed
through
my
mind
at
the
time
i
was
not
studying
her
personality
but
trying
to
understand
why
my
presence
in
the
house
had
so
visibly
disturbed
her
was
it
the
embarrassment
of
poverty
not
knowing
how
to
meet
the
call
made
so
suddenly
upon
it
i
hardly
thought
so
fear
would
not
enter
into
a
sensation
of
this
kind
and
fear
was
what
i
had
seen
in
her
face
before
the
front
door
had
closed
upon
me
but
that
fear
was
it
connected
with
me
or
with
something
threatening
her
from
another
portion
of
the
house
the
latter
supposition
seemed
the
probable
one
the
way
her
ear
was
turned
the
slight
start
she
gave
at
every
sound
convinced
me
that
her
cause
of
dread
lay
elsewhere
than
with
myself
and
therefore
was
worthy
of
my
closest
attention
though
i
chatted
and
tried
in
every
way
to
arouse
her
confidence
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
between
the
sentences
if
the
cause
of
her
apprehension
lay
with
her
sister
her
brother
or
in
something
entirely
apart
from
either
and
connected
with
the
dreadful
matter
which
had
drawn
me
to
x
or
another
supposition
still
was
it
merely
the
sign
of
an
habitual
distemper
which
misunderstood
by
gryce
had
given
rise
to
the
suspicions
which
it
was
my
possible
mission
here
to
dispel
anxious
to
force
things
a
little
i
remarked
with
a
glance
at
the
dismal
branches
that
almost
forced
their
way
into
the
open
casements
what
a
scene
for
young
eyes
like
yours
do
you
never
get
tired
of
these
and
clustering
shadows
would
not
a
little
cottage
in
the
sunnier
part
of
the
town
be
preferable
to
all
this
dreary
grandeur
she
looked
up
with
sudden
wistfulness
that
made
her
smile
piteous
some
of
my
happiest
days
have
been
passed
here
and
some
of
my
saddest
i
do
not
think
i
should
like
to
leave
it
for
any
sunny
cottage
we
were
not
made
for
bonny
homes
she
continued
the
sombreness
of
this
old
house
suits
us
and
of
this
road
i
ventured
it
is
the
darkest
and
most
picturesque
i
ever
rode
through
i
thought
i
was
threading
a
wilderness
for
a
moment
she
forgot
her
cause
of
anxiety
and
looked
at
me
quite
intently
while
a
subtle
shade
of
doubt
passed
slowly
over
her
features
it
is
a
solitary
one
she
acquiesced
i
do
not
wonder
it
struck
you
as
dismal
have
you
heard
has
any
one
ever
told
you
that
that
it
was
not
considered
quite
safe
safe
i
repeated
with
god
forgive
me
an
expression
of
mild
wonder
in
my
eyes
yes
it
has
not
the
best
of
reputations
strange
things
have
happened
in
it
i
thought
that
some
one
might
have
been
kind
enough
to
tell
you
this
at
the
station
there
was
a
gentle
sort
of
sarcasm
in
the
tone
only
that
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
i
began
to
feel
myself
in
a
maze
somebody
i
suppose
it
was
the
did
say
something
to
me
about
a
boy
lost
somewhere
in
this
portion
of
the
woods
do
you
mean
that
my
dear
she
nodded
glancing
again
over
her
shoulder
and
partly
rising
as
if
moved
by
some
instinct
of
flight
they
are
dark
enough
for
more
than
one
person
to
have
been
lost
in
their
recesses
i
observed
with
another
look
toward
the
heavily
curtained
windows
they
certainly
are
she
assented
reseating
herself
and
eying
me
nervously
while
she
spoke
we
are
used
to
the
terrors
they
inspire
in
strangers
but
if
you
she
leaped
to
her
feet
in
manifest
eagerness
and
her
whole
face
changed
in
a
way
she
little
realized
herself
if
you
have
any
fear
of
sleeping
amid
such
gloomy
surroundings
we
can
procure
you
a
room
in
the
village
where
you
will
be
more
comfortable
and
where
we
can
visit
you
almost
as
well
as
we
can
here
shall
i
do
it
shall
i
call
my
face
must
have
assumed
a
very
grim
look
for
her
words
tripped
at
that
point
and
a
flush
the
first
i
had
seen
on
her
cheek
suffused
her
face
giving
her
an
appearance
of
great
distress
oh
i
wish
loreen
would
come
i
am
not
at
all
happy
in
my
suggestions
she
said
with
a
deprecatory
twitch
of
her
lip
that
was
one
of
her
subtle
charms
oh
there
she
is
now
i
may
go
she
cried
and
without
the
least
appearance
of
realizing
that
she
had
said
anything
out
of
place
she
rushed
from
the
room
almost
before
her
sister
had
entered
it
but
not
before
their
eyes
had
met
in
a
look
of
unusual
significance
v
a
strange
household
had
i
not
surprised
this
look
of
mutual
understanding
i
might
have
received
an
impression
of
miss
knollys
which
would
in
a
measure
have
counteracted
that
made
by
the
more
nervous
and
less
restrained
lucetta
the
dignified
reserve
of
her
bearing
the
quiet
way
in
which
she
approached
and
above
all
the
even
tones
in
which
she
uttered
her
welcome
were
such
as
to
win
my
confidence
and
put
me
at
my
ease
in
the
house
of
which
she
was
the
nominal
mistress
but
that
look
with
that
in
my
memory
i
was
enabled
to
pierce
below
the
surface
of
this
placid
nature
and
in
the
very
constraint
she
put
upon
herself
detect
the
presence
of
the
same
secret
uneasiness
which
had
been
so
openly
if
unconsciously
manifested
by
her
sister
she
was
more
beautiful
than
lucetta
in
form
and
feature
and
even
more
markedly
elegant
in
her
plain
black
gown
and
fine
lawn
ruffles
but
she
lacked
her
sister
evanescent
charm
and
though
admirable
to
all
appearance
was
less
lovable
on
a
short
acquaintance
but
this
delays
my
tale
which
is
one
of
action
rather
than
reflection
i
had
naturally
expected
that
with
the
appearance
of
the
elder
miss
knollys
i
should
be
taken
to
my
room
but
on
the
contrary
she
sat
down
and
with
an
apologetic
air
informed
me
that
she
was
sorry
she
could
not
show
me
the
customary
attentions
circumstances
over
which
she
had
no
control
had
made
it
impossible
she
said
for
her
to
offer
me
the
but
if
i
would
be
so
good
as
to
accept
another
for
this
one
night
she
would
endeavor
to
provide
me
with
better
accommodations
on
the
morrow
satisfied
of
the
almost
painful
nature
of
their
poverty
and
determined
to
submit
to
privations
rather
than
leave
a
house
so
imbued
with
mystery
i
hastened
to
assure
her
that
any
room
would
be
acceptable
to
me
and
with
a
display
of
good
feeling
not
wholly
insincere
began
to
gather
up
my
wraps
in
anticipation
of
being
taken
at
once
but
miss
knollys
again
surprised
me
by
saying
that
my
room
was
not
yet
ready
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
complete
all
their
arrangements
and
begged
me
to
make
myself
at
home
in
the
room
where
i
was
till
evening
as
this
was
asking
a
good
deal
of
a
woman
of
my
years
fresh
from
a
railroad
journey
and
with
natural
habits
of
great
neatness
and
order
i
felt
somewhat
disconcerted
but
hiding
my
feelings
in
consideration
of
reasons
before
given
replaced
my
bundles
on
the
table
and
endeavored
to
make
the
best
of
a
somewhat
trying
situation
launching
at
once
into
conversation
i
began
as
with
lucetta
to
talk
about
her
mother
i
had
never
known
save
in
the
vaguest
way
why
knollys
had
taken
the
journey
which
had
ended
in
her
death
and
burial
in
a
foreign
land
rumor
had
it
that
she
had
gone
abroad
for
her
health
which
had
begun
to
fail
after
the
birth
of
lucetta
but
as
rumor
had
not
added
why
she
had
gone
unaccompanied
by
her
husband
or
children
there
remained
much
which
these
girls
might
willingly
tell
me
which
would
be
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
but
miss
knollys
intentionally
or
unintentionally
assumed
an
air
so
cold
at
my
well
meant
questions
that
i
desisted
from
pressing
them
and
began
to
talk
about
myself
in
a
way
which
i
hoped
would
establish
really
friendly
relations
between
us
and
make
it
possible
for
her
to
tell
me
later
if
not
at
the
present
moment
what
it
was
that
weighed
so
heavily
upon
the
household
that
no
one
could
enter
this
home
without
feeling
the
shadow
of
the
secret
terror
enveloping
it
but
miss
knollys
while
more
attentive
to
my
remarks
than
her
sister
had
been
showed
by
certain
unmistakable
signs
that
her
heart
and
interest
were
anywhere
but
in
that
room
and
while
i
could
not
regard
this
as
throwing
any
discredit
upon
my
powers
of
pleasing
which
have
rarely
failed
when
i
have
exerted
them
to
their
utmost
i
still
could
not
but
experience
the
dampening
effect
of
her
manner
i
went
on
chatting
but
in
a
desultory
way
noting
all
that
was
odd
in
her
unaccountable
reception
of
me
but
giving
as
i
firmly
believe
no
evidence
of
my
concern
and
rapidly
increasing
curiosity
the
peculiarities
observable
in
this
my
first
interview
with
these
interesting
but
by
no
means
sisters
continued
all
day
when
one
sister
came
in
the
other
stepped
out
and
when
dinner
was
announced
and
i
was
ushered
down
the
bare
and
dismal
hall
into
an
equally
bare
and
unattractive
it
was
to
find
the
chairs
set
for
four
and
lucetta
only
seated
at
the
table
where
is
loreen
i
asked
wonderingly
as
i
took
the
seat
she
pointed
out
to
me
with
one
of
her
faint
and
quickly
vanishing
smiles
she
can
not
come
at
present
my
young
hostess
stammered
with
an
unmistakable
glance
of
distress
at
the
large
woman
who
had
summoned
me
to
the
ah
i
ejaculated
thinking
that
possibly
loreen
had
found
it
necessary
to
assist
in
the
preparation
of
the
meal
and
your
brother
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
mentioned
since
my
first
inquiries
i
had
shrunk
from
the
venture
out
of
a
motive
of
pure
compassion
and
they
had
not
seen
fit
to
introduce
his
name
into
any
of
our
conversations
consequently
i
awaited
her
response
with
some
anxiety
having
a
secret
premonition
that
in
some
way
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
my
strange
reception
her
hasty
answer
given
however
without
any
increase
of
embarrassment
somewhat
dispelled
this
supposition
oh
he
will
be
in
presently
said
she
william
is
never
very
punctual
but
when
he
did
come
in
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
her
manner
instantly
changed
and
became
almost
painfully
anxious
though
it
was
my
first
meeting
with
the
real
head
of
the
house
she
waited
for
an
interchange
of
looks
with
him
before
giving
me
the
necessary
introduction
and
when
this
duty
performed
he
took
his
seat
at
the
table
her
thoughts
and
attention
remained
so
fixed
upon
him
that
she
forgot
the
ordinary
civilities
of
a
hostess
had
it
not
been
for
the
woman
i
have
spoken
of
who
in
her
attention
to
my
wants
amply
made
up
for
the
abstraction
of
her
mistress
i
should
have
fared
ill
at
this
meal
good
and
ample
as
it
was
considering
the
resources
of
those
who
provided
it
she
seemed
to
dread
to
have
him
speak
almost
to
have
him
move
she
watched
him
with
her
lips
half
open
ready
as
it
appeared
to
stop
any
inadvertent
expression
he
might
utter
in
his
efforts
to
be
agreeable
she
even
kept
her
left
hand
disengaged
with
the
evident
intention
of
stretching
it
out
in
his
direction
if
in
his
lumbering
stupidity
he
should
utter
a
sentence
calculated
to
open
my
eyes
to
what
she
so
passionately
desired
to
have
kept
secret
i
saw
it
all
as
plainly
as
i
saw
his
heavy
indifference
to
her
anxiety
and
knowing
from
experience
that
it
is
in
just
such
stolid
louts
as
these
that
the
worst
passions
are
often
hidden
i
took
advantage
of
my
years
and
forced
a
conversation
in
which
i
hoped
some
flash
of
his
real
self
would
appear
despite
her
wary
watch
upon
him
not
liking
to
renew
the
topic
of
the
lane
itself
i
asked
with
a
very
natural
show
of
interest
who
was
their
nearest
neighbor
it
was
william
who
looked
up
and
william
who
answered
old
mother
jane
is
the
nearest
said
he
but
she
no
good
we
never
think
of
her
trohm
is
the
only
neighbor
i
care
for
such
peaches
as
the
old
fellow
raises
such
grapes
such
melons
he
gave
me
two
of
the
nicest
you
ever
saw
this
morning
by
jupiter
i
taste
them
yet
lucetta
face
which
should
have
crimsoned
with
mortification
turned
most
unaccountably
pale
yet
not
so
pale
as
it
had
previously
done
when
a
few
minutes
before
he
began
to
say
loreen
wants
some
of
this
soup
saved
for
and
stopped
awkwardly
conscious
perhaps
that
loreen
wants
should
not
be
mentioned
before
me
i
thought
you
promised
me
that
you
would
never
again
ask
trohm
for
any
of
his
fruit
remonstrated
lucetta
oh
i
did
ask
i
just
stood
at
the
fence
and
looked
over
trohm
and
i
are
good
friends
why
should
i
eat
his
fruit
the
look
she
gave
him
might
have
moved
a
stone
but
he
seemed
perfectly
impervious
to
it
seeing
him
so
stolid
her
head
drooped
and
she
did
not
answer
a
word
yet
somehow
i
felt
that
even
while
she
was
so
manifestly
a
prey
to
the
deepest
mortification
her
attention
was
not
wholly
given
over
to
this
one
emotion
there
was
something
else
she
feared
hoping
to
relieve
her
and
lighten
the
situation
i
forced
myself
to
smile
on
the
young
man
as
i
said
why
do
you
raise
melons
yourself
i
think
if
i
possessed
your
land
i
should
be
anxious
to
raise
everything
i
could
on
it
oh
you
a
woman
he
retorted
almost
roughly
it
good
business
for
women
and
for
men
too
perhaps
who
love
to
see
fruit
hang
but
i
only
care
to
eat
it
do
lucetta
put
in
but
not
with
the
vigor
i
had
expected
i
like
to
hunt
train
dogs
and
enjoy
other
people
fruit
he
laughed
with
a
nod
at
the
blushing
lucetta
i
do
see
any
use
in
a
man
putting
himself
out
for
things
he
can
get
for
the
asking
too
short
for
such
folly
i
mean
to
have
a
good
time
while
i
on
this
blessed
sphere
william
the
cry
was
irresistible
yet
it
was
not
the
cry
i
had
been
looking
for
painful
as
was
this
exhibition
of
his
stupidity
and
utter
want
of
feeling
it
was
not
the
one
thing
she
stood
in
dread
of
or
why
was
her
protest
so
much
weaker
than
her
appearance
had
given
token
of
oh
he
shouted
in
great
amusement
while
she
shrunk
back
with
a
horrified
look
lucetta
do
like
to
hear
me
say
that
she
thinks
a
man
ought
to
work
plow
harrow
dig
make
a
slave
of
himself
to
keep
up
a
place
that
no
good
anyway
but
i
tell
her
that
work
is
something
she
never
get
out
of
me
i
was
born
a
gentleman
and
a
gentleman
i
will
live
if
the
place
tumbles
down
over
our
heads
perhaps
it
would
be
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
it
then
i
could
go
live
with
trohm
and
have
melons
from
early
morn
till
late
at
night
and
again
his
coarse
laugh
rang
out
this
or
was
it
his
words
seemed
to
rouse
her
as
nothing
had
done
before
thrusting
out
her
hand
she
laid
it
on
his
mouth
with
a
look
of
almost
frenzied
appeal
at
the
woman
who
was
standing
at
his
back
william
how
can
you
that
woman
protested
and
when
he
would
have
turned
upon
her
angrily
she
leaned
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
a
few
words
that
seemed
to
cow
him
for
he
gave
a
short
grunt
through
his
sister
trembling
fingers
and
with
a
shrug
of
his
heavy
shoulders
subsided
into
silence
to
all
this
i
was
a
simple
spectator
but
i
did
not
soon
forget
a
single
feature
of
the
scene
the
remainder
of
the
dinner
passed
quietly
william
and
myself
eating
with
more
or
less
heartiness
lucetta
tasting
nothing
at
all
in
mercy
to
her
i
declined
coffee
and
as
soon
as
william
gave
token
of
being
satisfied
we
hurriedly
rose
it
was
the
most
uncomfortable
meal
i
ever
ate
in
my
life
vi
a
sombre
evening
the
evening
like
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
the
with
one
of
the
sisters
one
event
alone
is
worth
recording
i
had
become
excessively
tired
of
a
conversation
that
always
languished
no
matter
on
what
topic
it
started
and
observing
an
old
piano
in
one
corner
i
once
played
very
well
i
sat
down
before
it
and
impulsively
struck
a
few
chords
from
the
yellow
keys
instantly
lucetta
it
was
lucetta
who
was
with
me
then
bounded
to
my
side
with
a
look
of
horror
do
do
that
she
cried
laying
her
hand
on
mine
to
stop
me
then
seeing
my
look
of
dignified
astonishment
she
added
with
an
appealing
smile
i
beg
pardon
but
every
sound
goes
through
me
are
you
not
well
i
asked
i
am
never
very
well
she
returned
and
we
went
back
to
the
sofa
and
renewed
our
forced
and
pitiful
attempts
at
conversation
promptly
at
nine
miss
knollys
came
in
she
was
very
pale
and
cast
as
usual
a
sad
and
uneasy
look
at
her
sister
before
she
spoke
to
me
immediately
lucetta
rose
and
becoming
very
pale
herself
was
hurrying
toward
the
door
when
her
sister
stopped
her
you
have
forgotten
she
said
to
say
to
our
guest
instantly
lucetta
turned
and
with
a
sudden
uncontrollable
impulse
seized
my
hand
and
pressed
it
convulsively
she
cried
i
hope
you
will
sleep
well
and
was
gone
before
i
could
say
a
word
in
response
why
does
lucetta
go
out
of
the
room
when
you
come
in
i
asked
determined
to
know
the
reason
for
this
peculiar
conduct
have
you
any
other
guests
in
the
house
the
reply
came
with
unexpected
vehemence
no
she
cried
why
should
you
think
so
there
is
no
one
here
but
the
family
and
she
turned
away
with
a
dignity
she
must
have
inherited
from
her
father
for
althea
burroughs
had
every
interesting
quality
but
that
you
must
be
very
tired
she
remarked
if
you
please
we
will
go
now
to
your
room
i
rose
at
once
glad
of
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
she
took
my
wraps
on
her
arm
and
we
passed
immediately
into
the
hall
as
we
did
so
i
heard
voices
one
of
them
shrill
and
full
of
distress
but
the
sound
was
so
quickly
smothered
by
a
closing
door
that
i
failed
to
discover
whether
this
tone
of
suffering
proceeded
from
a
man
or
a
woman
miss
knollys
who
was
preceding
me
glanced
back
in
some
alarm
but
as
i
gave
no
token
of
having
noticed
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
she
speedily
resumed
her
way
as
the
sounds
i
had
heard
proceeded
from
above
i
followed
her
with
alacrity
but
felt
my
enthusiasm
diminish
somewhat
when
i
found
myself
passing
door
after
door
down
a
long
hall
to
a
room
as
remote
as
possible
from
what
seemed
to
be
the
living
portion
of
the
house
is
it
necessary
to
put
me
off
quite
so
far
i
asked
as
my
young
hostess
paused
and
waited
for
me
to
join
her
on
the
threshold
of
the
most
forbidding
room
it
had
ever
been
my
fortune
to
enter
the
blush
which
mounted
to
her
brow
showed
that
she
felt
the
situation
keenly
i
am
sure
she
said
that
it
is
a
matter
of
great
regret
to
me
to
be
obliged
to
offer
you
so
mean
a
lodging
but
all
our
other
rooms
are
out
of
order
and
i
can
not
accommodate
you
with
anything
better
but
is
there
some
spot
nearer
you
i
urged
a
couch
in
the
same
room
with
you
would
be
more
acceptable
to
me
than
this
distant
room
i
i
hope
you
are
not
timid
she
began
but
i
hastened
to
disabuse
her
mind
on
this
score
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
earthly
thing
but
dogs
i
protested
warmly
but
i
do
not
like
solitude
i
came
here
for
companionship
my
dear
i
really
would
like
to
sleep
with
one
of
you
this
to
see
how
she
would
meet
such
urgency
she
met
it
as
i
might
have
known
she
would
by
a
rebuff
i
am
very
sorry
she
again
repeated
but
it
is
quite
impossible
if
i
could
give
you
the
comforts
you
are
accustomed
to
i
should
be
glad
but
we
are
unfortunate
we
girls
and
she
said
no
more
but
began
to
busy
herself
about
the
room
which
held
but
one
object
that
had
the
least
look
of
comfort
in
it
that
was
my
trunk
which
had
been
neatly
placed
in
one
corner
i
suppose
you
are
not
used
to
candles
she
remarked
lighting
what
struck
me
as
a
very
short
end
from
the
one
she
held
in
her
hand
my
dear
said
i
i
can
accommodate
myself
to
much
that
i
am
not
used
to
i
have
very
few
old
maid
ways
or
notions
you
shall
see
that
i
am
far
from
being
a
difficult
guest
she
heaved
a
sigh
and
then
seeing
my
eye
travelling
slowly
over
the
gray
discolored
walls
which
were
not
relieved
by
so
much
as
a
solitary
print
she
pointed
to
a
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
considerately
remarked
if
you
wish
anything
in
the
night
or
are
disturbed
in
any
way
pull
that
it
communicates
with
my
room
and
i
will
be
only
too
glad
to
come
to
you
i
glanced
up
at
the
rope
ran
my
eye
along
the
wire
communicating
with
it
and
saw
that
it
was
broken
sheer
off
before
it
even
entered
into
the
wall
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
hear
me
i
answered
pointing
to
the
break
she
flushed
a
deep
scarlet
and
for
a
moment
looked
as
embarrassed
as
ever
her
sister
had
done
i
did
not
know
she
murmured
the
house
is
so
old
everything
is
more
or
less
out
of
repair
and
she
made
haste
to
quit
the
room
i
stepped
after
her
in
grim
determination
but
there
is
no
key
to
the
door
i
objected
she
came
back
with
a
look
that
was
as
nearly
desperate
as
her
placid
features
were
capable
of
i
know
she
said
i
know
we
have
nothing
but
if
you
are
not
afraid
and
of
what
could
you
be
afraid
in
this
house
under
our
protection
and
with
a
good
dog
outside
you
will
bear
with
things
and
good
god
she
murmured
but
not
so
low
but
that
my
excited
sense
caught
every
syllable
can
she
have
heard
has
the
reputation
of
this
place
gone
abroad
miss
butterworth
she
repeated
earnestly
the
house
contains
no
cause
of
terror
for
you
nothing
threatens
our
guest
nor
need
you
have
the
least
concern
for
yourself
or
us
whether
the
night
passes
in
quiet
or
whether
it
is
broken
by
unaccountable
sounds
they
will
have
no
reference
to
anything
in
which
you
are
interested
ah
ha
thought
i
wo
they
you
give
me
credit
for
much
indifference
my
dear
but
i
said
nothing
beyond
a
few
soothing
phrases
which
i
made
purposely
short
seeing
that
every
moment
i
detained
her
was
just
so
much
unnecessary
torture
to
her
then
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
carefully
closed
the
door
my
first
night
in
this
dismal
and
strangely
ordered
house
had
opened
anything
but
propitiously
vii
the
first
night
i
spoke
with
a
due
regard
to
truth
when
i
assured
miss
knollys
that
i
entertained
no
fears
at
the
prospect
of
sleeping
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
i
am
a
woman
of
courage
or
so
i
have
always
believed
and
at
home
occupy
my
second
floor
alone
without
the
least
apprehension
but
there
is
a
difference
in
these
two
as
i
think
you
are
ready
by
this
time
to
acknowledge
and
though
i
felt
little
of
what
is
called
fear
i
certainly
did
not
experience
my
usual
satisfaction
in
the
minute
preparations
with
which
i
am
accustomed
to
make
myself
comfortable
for
the
night
there
was
a
gloom
both
within
and
without
the
four
bare
walls
between
which
i
now
found
myself
shut
which
i
would
have
been
something
less
than
human
not
to
feel
and
though
i
had
no
dread
of
being
overcome
by
it
i
was
glad
to
add
something
to
the
cheer
of
the
spot
by
opening
my
trunk
and
taking
out
a
few
of
those
little
matters
of
personal
equipment
without
which
the
brightest
room
looks
barren
and
a
den
like
this
too
desolate
for
habitation
then
i
took
a
good
look
about
me
to
see
how
i
could
obtain
for
myself
some
sense
of
security
the
bed
was
light
and
could
be
pulled
in
front
of
the
door
this
was
something
there
was
but
one
window
and
that
was
closely
draped
with
some
thick
dark
stuff
very
funereal
in
its
appearance
going
to
it
i
pulled
aside
the
thick
folds
and
looked
out
a
mass
of
heavy
foliage
at
once
met
my
eye
obstructing
the
view
of
the
sky
and
adding
much
to
the
lonesomeness
of
the
situation
i
let
the
curtain
fall
again
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
to
think
the
shortness
of
the
with
which
i
had
been
provided
had
struck
me
as
significant
so
significant
that
i
had
not
allowed
it
to
burn
long
after
miss
knollys
had
left
me
if
these
girls
charming
no
doubt
but
sly
had
thought
to
shorten
my
watch
by
shortening
my
candle
i
would
give
them
no
cause
to
think
but
that
their
ruse
had
been
successful
the
foresight
which
causes
me
to
add
a
winter
wrap
to
my
stock
of
clothing
even
when
the
weather
is
at
the
hottest
leads
me
to
place
a
half
dozen
or
so
of
candles
in
my
travelling
trunk
and
so
i
had
only
to
open
a
little
oblong
box
in
the
upper
tray
to
have
the
means
at
my
disposal
of
keeping
a
light
all
night
so
far
so
good
i
had
a
light
but
had
i
anything
else
in
case
william
knollys
but
with
this
thought
miss
knollys
look
and
reassuring
words
recurred
to
me
whatever
you
may
hear
if
you
hear
anything
will
have
no
reference
to
yourself
and
need
not
disturb
you
this
was
comforting
certainly
from
a
selfish
standpoint
but
did
it
relieve
my
mind
concerning
others
not
knowing
what
to
think
of
it
all
and
fully
conscious
that
sleep
would
not
visit
me
under
existing
circumstances
i
finally
made
up
my
mind
not
to
lie
down
till
better
assured
that
sleep
on
my
part
would
be
desirable
so
after
making
the
various
little
arrangements
already
alluded
to
i
drew
over
my
shoulders
a
comfortable
shawl
and
set
myself
to
listen
for
what
i
feared
would
be
more
than
one
dreary
hour
of
this
not
to
be
envied
night
and
here
just
let
me
stop
to
mention
that
carefully
considered
as
all
my
precautions
were
i
had
forgotten
one
thing
upon
leaving
home
which
at
this
minute
made
me
very
nearly
miserable
i
had
not
included
among
my
effects
the
alcohol
lamp
and
all
the
other
private
and
particular
conveniences
which
i
possess
for
making
tea
in
my
own
apartment
had
i
but
had
them
with
me
and
had
i
been
able
to
make
and
sip
a
cup
of
my
own
delicious
tea
through
the
ordeal
of
listening
for
whatever
sounds
might
come
to
disturb
the
midnight
stillness
of
this
house
what
relief
it
would
have
been
to
my
spirits
and
in
what
a
different
light
i
might
have
regarded
gryce
and
the
mission
with
which
i
had
been
intrusted
but
i
not
only
lacked
this
element
of
comfort
but
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
it
was
any
one
fault
but
my
own
lena
had
laid
her
hand
on
that
teapot
but
i
had
shaken
my
head
fearing
that
the
sight
of
it
might
offend
the
eyes
of
my
young
hostesses
but
i
had
not
calculated
upon
being
put
in
a
remote
corner
like
this
of
a
house
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
dozen
families
and
if
ever
i
travel
again
but
this
is
a
matter
personal
to
amelia
butterworth
and
of
no
interest
to
you
i
will
not
inflict
my
little
foibles
upon
you
again
eleven
came
and
went
i
had
heard
no
sound
twelve
and
i
began
to
think
that
all
was
not
quite
so
still
as
before
that
i
certainly
could
hear
now
and
then
faint
noises
as
of
a
door
creaking
on
its
hinges
or
the
smothered
sound
of
stealthily
moving
feet
yet
all
was
so
far
from
being
distinct
that
for
some
time
i
hesitated
to
acknowledge
to
myself
that
anything
could
be
going
on
in
the
house
which
was
not
to
be
looked
for
in
a
home
professing
to
be
simply
the
abode
of
a
decent
young
man
and
two
very
young
ladies
and
even
after
the
noises
and
whispering
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
i
could
even
distinguish
the
sullen
tones
of
the
brother
from
the
softer
and
more
carefully
modulated
accents
of
lucetta
and
her
sister
i
found
myself
ready
to
explain
the
matter
by
any
conjecture
short
of
that
which
involved
these
delicate
young
ladies
in
any
scheme
of
secret
wickedness
but
when
i
found
there
was
likely
to
be
no
diminution
in
the
various
noises
and
movements
that
were
taking
place
in
the
front
of
the
house
and
that
only
something
much
out
of
the
ordinary
could
account
for
so
much
disturbance
in
a
country
home
so
long
after
midnight
i
decided
that
only
a
person
insensible
to
all
sight
and
sound
could
be
expected
to
remain
asleep
under
such
circumstances
and
that
i
would
be
perfectly
justified
in
their
eyes
in
opening
my
door
and
taking
a
peep
down
the
corridor
so
without
further
ado
i
drew
my
bed
aside
and
glanced
out
all
was
perfectly
dark
and
silent
in
the
great
house
the
only
light
visible
came
from
the
candle
burning
in
the
room
behind
me
and
as
for
sound
it
was
almost
too
still
it
was
the
stillness
of
intent
rather
than
that
of
natural
repose
this
was
so
unexpected
that
for
an
instant
i
stood
baffled
and
wondering
then
my
nose
went
up
and
i
laughed
quietly
to
myself
i
could
see
nothing
and
i
could
hear
nothing
but
amelia
butterworth
like
most
of
her
kind
boasts
of
more
than
two
senses
and
happily
there
was
something
to
smell
a
quickly
candle
leaves
a
witness
behind
it
to
sensitive
nostrils
like
mine
and
this
witness
assured
me
that
the
darkness
was
deceptive
some
one
had
just
passed
the
head
of
my
corridor
with
a
light
and
because
the
light
was
extinguished
it
did
not
follow
that
the
person
who
held
it
was
far
away
indeed
i
thought
that
now
i
heard
a
palpitating
breath
humph
i
cried
aloud
but
as
if
in
unconscious
communion
with
myself
it
is
not
often
i
have
so
vivid
a
dream
i
was
sure
that
i
heard
steps
in
the
hall
i
fear
i
growing
nervous
nothing
moved
no
one
answered
me
miss
knollys
i
called
firmly
no
reply
lucetta
dear
i
thought
this
appeal
would
go
unanswered
also
but
when
i
raised
my
voice
for
the
third
time
a
sudden
rushing
sound
took
place
down
the
corridor
and
lucetta
excited
figure
fully
dressed
appeared
in
the
faint
circle
of
light
caused
by
my
now
rapidly
waning
candle
miss
butterworth
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
making
as
if
she
would
draw
me
into
my
room
a
proceeding
which
i
took
good
care
she
should
not
succeed
in
giving
a
glance
at
her
dress
which
was
the
same
she
had
worn
at
the
supper
table
i
laughingly
retorted
is
that
a
question
i
might
better
ask
you
it
is
two
by
my
watch
and
you
for
all
your
apparent
delicacy
are
still
up
what
does
it
mean
my
dear
have
i
put
you
out
so
completely
by
my
coming
that
none
of
you
can
sleep
her
eyes
which
had
fallen
before
mine
quickly
looked
up
i
am
sorry
she
began
flushing
and
trying
to
take
a
peep
into
my
room
possibly
to
see
if
i
had
been
to
bed
we
did
not
mean
to
disturb
you
but
but
oh
miss
butterworth
pray
excuse
our
makeshifts
and
our
poverty
we
wished
to
fix
up
another
room
for
you
and
were
ashamed
to
have
you
see
how
little
we
had
to
do
it
with
so
we
were
moving
some
things
out
of
our
own
room
and
here
her
voice
broke
and
she
burst
into
an
almost
uncontrollable
flood
of
tears
do
she
entreated
do
as
quite
thoroughly
ashamed
i
began
to
utter
some
excuses
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
moment
i
am
used
to
humiliations
only
and
her
whole
body
seemed
to
join
in
the
plea
it
trembled
so
do
not
i
pray
speak
quite
so
loud
my
brother
is
more
sensitive
than
even
loreen
and
myself
about
these
things
and
if
he
should
hear
here
a
suppressed
oath
from
way
down
the
hall
assured
me
that
he
did
hear
but
i
gave
no
sign
of
my
recognition
of
this
fact
and
lucetta
added
quickly
he
would
not
forgive
us
for
our
carelessness
in
waking
you
he
is
rough
sometimes
but
so
good
at
heart
so
good
this
with
the
other
small
matter
i
have
just
mentioned
caused
a
revulsion
in
my
feelings
he
good
i
did
not
believe
it
yet
her
eyes
showed
no
wavering
when
i
interrogated
them
with
mine
and
feeling
that
i
had
perhaps
been
doing
them
all
an
injustice
and
that
what
i
had
seen
was
as
she
evidently
meant
to
intimate
due
to
their
efforts
to
make
a
sudden
guest
comfortable
amid
their
poverty
i
put
the
best
face
i
could
on
the
matter
and
gave
the
poor
pitiful
pleading
face
a
kiss
i
was
startled
to
feel
how
cold
her
forehead
was
and
more
and
more
concerned
loaded
her
down
with
such
assurances
of
appreciation
as
came
to
my
lips
and
sent
her
back
to
her
own
room
with
an
injunction
not
to
trouble
herself
any
more
about
fixing
up
any
other
room
for
me
only
i
added
as
her
whole
face
showed
relief
we
will
go
to
the
locksmith
and
get
a
key
and
after
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
see
that
i
have
a
cup
of
tea
brought
to
my
room
just
before
i
retire
i
am
no
good
without
my
cup
of
tea
my
dear
what
keeps
other
people
awake
makes
me
sleep
oh
you
shall
have
your
tea
she
cried
with
an
eagerness
that
was
almost
unnatural
and
then
slipping
from
my
grasp
she
uttered
another
hasty
apology
for
having
roused
me
from
my
sleep
and
ran
hastily
back
i
stretched
out
my
arm
for
the
candle
guttering
in
my
room
and
held
it
up
to
light
her
she
seemed
to
shrink
at
sight
of
its
rays
and
the
last
vision
i
had
of
her
speeding
figure
showed
me
that
same
look
of
dread
on
her
pallid
features
which
had
aroused
my
interest
in
our
first
interview
she
may
have
explained
why
the
three
of
them
are
up
at
this
time
of
night
i
muttered
but
she
has
not
explained
why
her
every
conversation
is
seasoned
by
an
expression
of
fear
and
thus
brooding
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
pushing
the
bed
again
against
the
door
lay
down
upon
it
and
out
of
sheer
chagrin
fell
fast
asleep
viii
on
the
stairs
i
did
not
wake
up
till
morning
the
room
was
so
dark
that
in
all
probability
i
should
not
have
wakened
then
if
my
habits
of
exact
punctuality
had
not
been
aided
by
a
gentle
knock
at
my
door
who
there
i
called
for
i
could
not
say
come
in
till
i
had
moved
my
bed
and
made
way
for
the
door
to
open
hannah
with
warm
water
replied
a
voice
at
which
i
made
haste
to
rise
hannah
was
the
woman
who
had
waited
on
us
at
dinner
the
sight
of
her
pleasant
countenance
which
nevertheless
looked
a
trifle
haggard
was
a
welcome
relief
after
the
sombre
features
of
the
night
addressing
her
with
my
usual
brusqueness
but
with
quite
my
usual
kindness
i
asked
how
the
young
ladies
were
feeling
this
morning
her
answer
made
a
great
show
of
frankness
oh
they
are
much
as
usual
said
she
miss
loreen
is
in
the
kitchen
and
miss
lucetta
will
soon
be
here
to
inquire
how
you
are
i
hope
you
passed
a
good
night
yourself
i
had
slept
more
than
i
ought
to
perhaps
and
made
haste
to
reassure
her
as
to
my
own
condition
then
seeing
that
a
little
talk
would
not
be
unwelcome
to
this
hearty
woman
tired
to
death
possibly
with
life
in
this
dreary
house
i
made
some
excuse
for
keeping
her
a
few
minutes
saying
as
i
did
so
what
an
immense
dwelling
this
is
for
four
persons
to
live
in
or
have
you
another
inmate
whom
i
have
not
seen
i
thought
her
buxom
color
showed
a
momentary
sign
of
failing
but
it
all
came
back
with
her
answer
which
was
given
in
a
round
hearty
voice
oh
i
the
only
maid
i
cook
and
sweep
and
all
i
abide
another
near
me
even
simsbury
who
tends
the
cow
and
horse
and
who
only
comes
in
for
his
dinner
worries
me
by
spells
i
like
to
have
my
own
way
in
the
kitchen
except
when
the
young
ladies
choose
to
come
in
is
there
anything
more
you
want
and
do
you
prefer
tea
or
coffee
for
breakfast
i
told
her
that
i
always
drank
coffee
in
the
morning
and
would
have
liked
to
have
added
a
question
or
two
but
she
gave
me
no
chance
as
she
went
out
i
saw
her
glance
at
my
candlestick
there
was
only
a
end
in
it
she
is
calculating
too
how
long
i
sat
up
thought
lucetta
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
i
went
down
will
you
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
said
she
i
am
not
quite
ready
to
follow
you
but
will
be
soon
i
will
take
a
look
at
the
grounds
i
thought
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
her
face
lighted
up
be
sure
you
do
encounter
the
dog
she
cried
and
slipped
hastily
down
a
side
hall
i
had
not
noticed
the
night
before
ah
a
good
way
to
keep
me
in
i
reasoned
but
i
shall
see
the
grounds
yet
if
i
have
to
poison
that
dog
notwithstanding
i
made
no
haste
to
leave
the
house
i
do
believe
in
tempting
providence
especially
where
a
dog
is
concerned
instead
of
that
i
stood
still
and
looked
up
and
down
the
halls
endeavoring
to
get
some
idea
of
their
plan
and
of
the
location
of
my
own
room
in
reference
to
the
rest
i
found
that
the
main
hall
ran
at
right
angles
to
the
long
corridor
down
which
i
had
just
come
and
noting
that
the
doors
opening
into
it
were
of
a
size
and
finish
vastly
superior
to
those
i
had
passed
in
the
corridor
just
mentioned
i
judged
that
the
best
bedrooms
all
lay
front
and
that
i
had
been
quartered
at
the
end
of
what
had
once
been
considered
as
the
servants
hall
at
my
right
as
i
looked
down
the
stairs
ran
a
wall
with
a
break
which
looked
like
an
opening
into
another
corridor
and
indeed
i
afterward
learned
that
the
long
series
of
rooms
of
which
mine
was
the
last
had
its
counterpart
on
the
other
side
of
this
enormous
dwelling
giving
to
the
house
the
shape
of
a
long
square
i
was
looking
in
some
wonderment
at
this
opening
and
marvelling
over
the
extravagant
hospitality
of
those
old
days
which
necessitated
such
a
number
of
rooms
in
a
private
gentleman
home
when
i
heard
a
door
open
and
two
voices
speaking
one
was
rough
and
careless
unmistakably
that
of
william
knollys
the
other
was
slow
and
timid
and
was
just
as
unmistakably
that
of
the
man
who
had
driven
me
to
this
house
the
day
before
they
were
talking
of
some
elderly
person
and
i
had
good
sense
enough
not
to
allow
my
indignation
to
blind
me
to
the
fact
that
by
that
elderly
person
they
meant
me
this
is
important
for
their
words
were
not
without
significance
how
shall
we
keep
the
old
girl
out
of
the
house
till
it
is
all
over
was
what
i
heard
from
william
surly
lips
lucetta
has
a
plan
was
the
hardly
distinguishable
answer
i
am
to
take
that
was
all
i
could
hear
a
closing
door
shut
off
the
remainder
something
then
was
going
on
in
this
house
of
a
dark
if
not
mysterious
character
and
the
attempts
made
by
these
two
interesting
and
devoted
girls
to
cover
up
the
fact
by
explanations
founded
on
their
poverty
had
been
but
subterfuges
after
all
grieved
on
their
account
but
inwardly
grateful
to
the
imprudence
of
their
more
than
reckless
brother
for
this
glimpse
into
the
truth
i
slowly
descended
the
stairs
in
that
state
of
complete
which
is
given
by
a
secret
knowledge
of
the
intentions
formed
against
us
by
those
whose
actions
we
have
reason
to
suspect
henceforth
i
had
but
one
duty
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
this
household
whether
it
was
the
one
suspected
by
gryce
or
another
of
a
less
evil
and
dangerous
character
hardly
mattered
in
my
eyes
while
the
blight
of
it
rested
upon
this
family
eyes
would
be
lowered
and
heads
shaken
at
their
name
this
if
i
could
help
it
must
no
longer
be
if
guilt
lay
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
fear
then
this
guilt
must
be
known
if
innocence
i
thought
of
the
brother
lowering
brow
and
felt
it
incompatible
with
innocence
but
remembering
gryce
remarks
on
this
subject
read
an
instant
lecture
to
myself
and
putting
all
conclusions
aside
devoted
the
few
minutes
in
which
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
to
a
careful
preparation
of
my
mind
for
its
duty
which
was
not
likely
to
be
of
the
simplest
character
if
lucetta
keen
wits
were
to
be
pitted
against
mine
ix
a
new
acquaintance
when
my
mind
is
set
free
from
doubt
and
fully
settled
upon
any
course
i
am
capable
of
much
good
nature
and
seeming
simplicity
i
was
therefore
able
to
maintain
my
own
at
the
with
some
success
so
that
the
meal
passed
off
without
any
of
the
disagreeable
experiences
of
the
night
before
perhaps
the
fact
that
loreen
presided
at
the
instead
of
lucetta
had
something
to
do
with
this
her
calm
even
looks
seemed
to
put
some
restraint
upon
the
boisterous
outbursts
to
which
william
was
only
too
liable
while
her
less
excitable
nature
suffered
less
if
by
any
chance
he
did
break
out
and
startle
the
decorous
silence
by
one
of
his
rude
guffaws
i
am
a
slow
eater
but
i
felt
forced
to
hurry
through
the
meal
or
be
left
eating
alone
at
the
end
this
did
not
put
me
in
the
best
of
humor
for
i
hated
to
risk
an
indigestion
just
when
my
faculties
needed
to
be
unusually
alert
i
compromised
by
leaving
the
board
hungry
but
i
did
it
with
such
a
smile
that
i
do
not
think
miss
knollys
knew
i
had
not
risen
from
any
table
so
ill
satisfied
in
years
i
will
leave
you
to
my
brother
for
a
few
minutes
said
she
hastily
tripping
from
the
room
i
pray
that
you
will
not
think
of
going
to
your
room
till
we
have
had
an
opportunity
of
arranging
it
i
instantly
made
up
my
mind
to
disobey
this
injunction
but
first
it
was
necessary
to
see
what
i
could
make
of
william
he
was
not
a
very
promising
subject
as
he
turned
and
led
the
way
toward
the
front
of
the
house
i
thought
you
might
like
to
see
the
grounds
he
growled
evidently
not
enjoying
the
rôle
assigned
him
they
are
so
attractive
he
sneered
children
hereabout
call
them
the
jungle
who
to
blame
for
that
i
asked
with
only
a
partial
humoring
of
his
ill
nature
you
have
a
sturdy
pair
of
arms
of
your
own
and
a
little
trimming
here
and
a
little
trimming
there
would
have
given
quite
a
different
appearance
to
this
undergrowth
a
gentleman
usually
takes
pride
in
his
place
yes
when
it
all
his
this
belongs
to
my
sisters
as
much
as
to
me
what
the
use
of
my
bothering
myself
about
it
the
man
was
so
selfish
he
did
not
realize
the
extent
of
the
exhibition
he
made
of
it
indeed
he
seemed
to
take
pride
in
what
he
probably
called
his
independence
i
began
to
feel
the
most
intense
aversion
for
him
and
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
prolong
this
conversation
unmoved
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
give
that
much
assistance
to
your
sisters
they
do
not
seem
to
be
sparing
in
their
attempts
to
please
you
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
i
was
afraid
a
dog
or
two
would
come
leaping
around
the
corner
of
the
house
but
it
was
only
his
way
of
expressing
disdain
oh
the
girls
are
well
enough
he
grumbled
but
they
will
stick
to
the
place
lucetta
might
have
married
a
times
and
once
i
thought
she
was
going
to
but
suddenly
she
turned
straight
about
and
sent
her
lover
packing
and
that
made
me
mad
beyond
everything
why
should
she
hang
on
to
me
like
a
burr
when
there
are
other
folks
willing
to
take
on
the
burden
it
was
the
most
palpable
display
of
egotism
i
had
ever
seen
and
one
of
the
most
revolting
i
was
so
disgusted
by
it
that
i
spoke
up
without
any
too
much
caution
perhaps
she
thinks
she
can
be
useful
to
you
i
said
i
have
known
sisters
give
up
their
own
happiness
on
no
better
grounds
useful
he
sneered
it
a
usefulness
a
man
like
me
can
dispense
with
do
you
know
what
i
would
like
we
were
standing
in
one
of
the
tangled
pathways
with
our
faces
turned
toward
the
house
as
he
spoke
he
looked
up
and
made
a
rude
sort
of
gesture
toward
the
blank
expanse
of
empty
and
curtainless
windows
i
would
like
that
great
house
all
to
myself
to
make
into
one
huge
bachelor
hall
i
should
like
to
feel
that
i
could
tramp
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
without
awakening
an
echo
i
did
not
choose
to
hear
there
i
should
not
find
it
too
big
i
should
not
find
it
too
lonesome
i
and
my
dogs
would
know
how
to
fill
it
would
we
saracen
oh
i
forgot
saracen
is
locked
up
the
way
he
mumbled
the
last
sentence
showed
displeasure
but
i
gave
little
heed
to
that
the
gloating
way
in
which
he
said
he
and
his
dogs
would
fill
it
had
given
me
a
sort
of
turn
i
began
to
have
more
than
an
aversion
for
the
man
he
inspired
me
with
something
like
terror
your
wishes
said
i
with
as
little
expression
as
possible
seem
to
leave
your
sisters
entirely
out
of
your
calculations
how
would
your
mother
regard
that
if
she
could
see
you
from
the
place
where
she
is
gone
he
turned
upon
me
with
a
look
of
anger
that
made
his
features
positively
ugly
what
do
you
mean
by
speaking
to
me
of
my
mother
have
i
spoken
of
her
to
you
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should
lug
my
mother
into
this
conversation
if
so
say
so
and
be
he
did
not
swear
at
me
he
did
not
dare
to
but
he
came
precious
near
to
it
and
that
was
enough
to
make
me
recoil
she
was
my
friend
said
i
i
knew
and
loved
her
before
you
were
born
that
was
why
i
spoke
of
her
and
i
think
it
very
natural
myself
he
seemed
to
feel
ashamed
he
grumbled
out
some
sort
of
apology
and
looked
about
quite
helplessly
possibly
for
the
dog
he
manifestly
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
forever
at
his
heels
i
took
advantage
of
this
momentary
abstraction
on
his
part
to
smooth
my
own
disturbed
features
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
i
remarked
on
the
principle
that
the
ice
once
broken
one
should
not
hesitate
about
jumping
in
was
your
father
equally
handsome
for
a
man
my
father
yes
let
talk
of
father
he
was
a
judge
of
horses
he
was
when
he
died
there
were
three
mares
in
the
stable
not
to
be
beat
this
side
of
albany
but
those
devils
of
executors
sold
them
and
i
well
you
had
a
chance
to
test
the
speed
of
old
bess
yesterday
you
afraid
of
being
thrown
out
i
take
it
great
scott
to
think
of
a
man
of
my
tastes
owning
no
other
horse
than
that
you
have
not
answered
my
question
i
suggested
turning
him
about
and
moving
toward
the
gate
oh
about
the
way
my
father
looked
what
does
that
matter
he
was
handsome
though
folks
say
that
i
get
whatever
good
looks
i
have
from
him
he
was
big
bigger
than
i
am
and
while
he
lived
what
did
you
make
a
fellow
talk
for
i
do
know
why
i
did
but
i
was
certainly
astonished
at
the
result
this
great
huge
lump
of
selfish
clay
had
actually
shown
feeling
and
was
ashamed
of
it
like
the
lout
he
was
yesterday
said
i
anxious
to
change
the
subject
i
had
difficulty
in
getting
in
through
that
gate
we
are
pointing
for
could
you
set
it
straight
with
just
a
little
effort
he
paused
looked
at
me
to
see
if
i
were
in
earnest
then
took
a
dogged
step
toward
the
gate
i
was
still
indicating
with
my
resolute
right
hand
but
before
he
could
touch
it
he
perceived
something
on
that
deserted
and
ominous
highway
which
made
him
start
in
sudden
surprise
why
trohm
he
cried
is
that
you
well
it
an
age
since
i
have
seen
you
turn
that
corner
on
a
visit
to
us
sometime
certainly
answered
a
hearty
and
pleasant
voice
and
before
i
could
quite
drop
the
look
of
severity
with
which
i
was
endeavoring
to
shame
this
young
man
into
some
decent
show
of
interest
in
this
place
and
assume
the
more
becoming
aspect
of
a
lady
caught
unawares
at
an
early
morning
hour
plucking
flowers
from
a
stunted
syringa
a
gentleman
stepped
into
sight
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
with
a
look
and
a
bow
so
genial
and
devoid
of
mystery
that
i
experienced
for
the
first
time
since
entering
the
gloomy
precincts
of
this
town
a
decided
sensation
of
pleasure
miss
butterworth
explained
knollys
with
a
somewhat
forced
gesture
in
my
direction
a
guest
of
my
sisters
he
went
on
and
looked
as
if
he
hoped
i
would
retire
though
he
made
no
motion
to
welcome
trohm
in
but
rather
leaned
a
little
conspicuously
on
the
gate
as
if
anxious
to
show
that
he
had
no
idea
that
the
other
intention
went
any
further
than
the
passing
of
a
few
neighborly
comments
at
the
gate
i
like
to
please
the
young
even
when
they
are
no
more
agreeable
than
my
surly
host
and
if
the
gentleman
who
had
just
shown
himself
had
been
equally
immature
i
would
certainly
have
left
them
to
have
their
talk
out
undisturbed
but
he
was
not
he
was
older
he
was
even
of
sufficient
years
for
his
judgment
to
have
become
thoroughly
matured
and
his
every
faculty
developed
i
therefore
could
not
see
why
my
society
should
be
considered
an
intrusion
by
him
so
i
waited
his
next
sentence
was
addressed
to
me
i
am
happy
said
he
to
have
the
pleasure
of
a
personal
introduction
to
miss
butterworth
i
did
not
expect
it
the
surprise
is
all
the
more
agreeable
i
only
anticipated
being
allowed
to
leave
this
package
and
letter
with
the
maid
they
are
addressed
to
you
madam
and
were
left
at
my
house
by
mistake
i
could
not
hide
my
astonishment
i
live
in
the
next
house
below
said
he
the
boy
who
brought
these
from
the
post
office
was
a
stupid
lad
and
i
could
not
induce
him
to
come
any
farther
up
the
road
i
hope
you
will
excuse
the
present
messenger
and
believe
there
has
been
no
delay
i
bowed
with
what
must
have
seemed
an
abstracted
politeness
the
letter
was
from
new
york
and
as
i
strongly
suspected
from
gryce
somehow
this
fact
created
in
me
an
unmistakable
embarrassment
i
put
both
letter
and
package
into
my
pocket
and
endeavored
to
meet
the
gentleman
eye
with
my
accustomed
ease
in
the
presence
of
strangers
but
strange
to
say
i
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
i
saw
that
he
was
no
more
at
his
ease
than
myself
he
smiled
glanced
at
william
made
an
offhand
remark
or
so
about
the
weather
but
he
could
not
deceive
eyes
sharpened
by
such
experience
as
mine
something
disturbed
him
something
connected
with
me
it
made
my
cheek
a
little
hot
to
acknowledge
this
even
to
myself
but
it
was
so
very
evident
that
i
began
to
cast
about
for
the
means
of
ridding
ourselves
of
william
when
that
blundering
youth
suddenly
spoke
i
suppose
he
was
afraid
to
come
up
the
lane
do
you
know
i
think
you
brave
to
attempt
it
trohm
we
have
a
very
good
name
here
and
with
a
sudden
perfectly
unnatural
burst
he
broke
out
into
one
of
his
huge
guffaws
that
so
shook
the
old
gate
on
which
he
was
leaning
that
i
thought
it
would
tumble
down
with
him
before
our
eyes
i
saw
trohm
start
and
cast
him
a
look
in
which
i
seemed
to
detect
both
surprise
and
horror
before
he
turned
to
me
and
with
an
air
of
polite
deprecation
anxiously
said
i
am
afraid
miss
butterworth
will
not
understand
your
allusions
knollys
i
hear
this
is
her
first
visit
in
town
as
his
manner
showed
even
more
feeling
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
warrant
i
made
haste
to
answer
that
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
tradition
of
the
lane
that
its
name
alone
showed
what
had
happened
here
his
bearing
betrayed
an
instant
relief
i
am
glad
to
find
you
so
well
informed
said
he
i
was
afraid
here
he
cast
another
very
strange
glance
at
william
that
your
young
friends
might
have
shrunk
from
some
sense
of
delicacy
from
telling
you
what
might
frighten
most
guests
from
a
lonely
road
like
this
i
compliment
you
upon
their
thoughtfulness
william
bowed
as
if
the
words
of
the
other
contained
no
other
suggestion
than
that
which
was
openly
apparent
was
he
so
dull
or
was
he
i
had
not
time
to
finish
my
conjectures
even
in
my
own
mind
for
at
this
moment
a
quick
cry
rose
behind
us
and
lucetta
light
figure
appeared
running
toward
us
with
every
indication
of
excitement
ah
murmured
trohm
with
an
appearance
of
great
respect
your
sister
knollys
i
had
better
be
moving
on
miss
butterworth
i
am
sorry
that
circumstances
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
offer
you
those
civilities
which
you
might
reasonably
expect
from
so
near
a
neighbor
miss
lucetta
and
i
are
at
swords
points
over
a
matter
upon
which
i
still
insist
she
is
to
blame
see
how
shocked
she
is
to
see
me
even
standing
at
her
gate
shocked
i
would
have
said
terrified
nothing
but
fear
her
old
fear
aggravated
to
a
point
that
made
all
attempt
at
concealment
impossible
could
account
for
her
white
drawn
features
and
trembling
form
she
looked
as
if
her
whole
thought
was
have
i
come
in
time
what
what
has
procured
us
the
honor
of
this
visit
she
asked
moving
up
beside
william
as
if
she
would
add
her
slight
frame
to
his
bulky
one
to
keep
this
intruder
out
nothing
that
need
alarm
you
said
the
other
with
a
suggestive
note
in
his
kind
and
mellow
voice
i
was
rather
unexpectedly
intrusted
this
morning
with
a
letter
for
your
agreeable
guest
here
and
i
have
merely
come
to
deliver
it
her
look
of
astonishment
passing
from
him
to
me
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
drew
out
the
letter
which
i
had
just
received
from
home
said
i
without
properly
considering
that
this
was
in
some
measure
an
untruth
oh
she
murmured
as
if
but
half
convinced
william
could
have
gone
for
it
she
added
still
eying
trohm
with
a
pitiful
anxiety
i
was
only
too
happy
said
the
other
with
a
low
and
reassuring
bow
then
as
if
he
saw
that
her
distress
would
only
be
relieved
by
his
departure
he
raised
his
hat
and
stepped
back
into
the
open
highway
i
will
not
intrude
again
miss
knollys
were
his
parting
words
if
you
want
anything
of
obadiah
trohm
you
know
where
to
find
him
his
doors
will
always
be
open
to
you
lucetta
with
a
start
laid
her
hand
on
her
brother
arm
as
if
to
restrain
the
words
she
saw
slowly
laboring
to
his
lips
and
leaning
breathlessly
forward
watched
the
fine
figure
of
this
perfect
country
gentleman
till
it
had
withdrawn
quite
out
of
sight
then
she
turned
and
with
a
quick
abandonment
of
all
cried
out
with
a
pitiful
gesture
toward
her
brother
i
thought
all
was
over
i
feared
he
meant
to
come
into
the
house
and
fell
stark
and
seemingly
lifeless
at
our
feet
x
secret
instructions
for
a
moment
william
and
myself
stood
looking
at
each
other
over
this
frail
and
prostrate
figure
then
he
stooped
and
with
an
unexpected
show
of
kindness
raised
her
up
and
began
carrying
her
toward
the
house
lucetta
is
a
fool
he
cried
suddenly
stopping
and
giving
me
a
quick
glance
over
his
shoulder
because
folks
are
terrified
of
this
road
and
come
to
see
us
but
seldom
she
has
got
to
feel
a
most
unreasonable
dread
of
visitors
she
was
even
set
against
your
coming
till
we
showed
her
what
folly
it
was
for
her
to
think
we
could
always
live
here
like
hermits
then
she
does
like
trohm
thinks
he
is
altogether
too
friendly
to
me
as
if
that
was
any
of
her
business
am
i
an
idiot
have
i
no
sense
can
not
i
be
trusted
to
take
care
of
my
own
affairs
and
keep
my
own
secrets
she
a
weak
silly
chit
to
go
and
flop
over
like
this
when
d
n
it
we
have
enough
to
look
after
without
nursing
her
up
and
i
mean
he
said
tripping
himself
up
with
an
air
of
polite
consideration
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
usual
churlishness
as
to
be
more
than
noticeable
that
it
can
not
add
much
to
the
pleasure
of
your
visit
to
have
such
things
happen
as
this
oh
do
worry
about
me
i
curtly
responded
get
the
poor
girl
in
i
look
after
her
but
as
if
she
heard
these
words
and
was
startled
by
them
lucetta
roused
in
her
brother
arms
and
struggled
passionately
to
her
feet
oh
what
has
happened
to
me
she
cried
have
i
said
anything
william
have
i
said
anything
she
asked
wildly
clinging
to
her
brother
in
terror
he
gave
her
a
look
and
pushed
her
off
what
are
you
talking
about
he
cried
one
would
think
you
had
something
to
conceal
she
steadied
herself
up
in
an
instant
i
am
the
weakest
of
the
family
said
she
walking
straight
up
to
me
and
taking
me
affectionately
by
the
arm
all
my
life
i
have
been
delicate
and
these
turns
are
nothing
new
to
me
sometimes
i
think
i
will
die
in
one
of
them
but
i
am
quite
restored
now
she
hastily
added
as
i
could
not
help
showing
my
concern
see
i
can
walk
quite
alone
and
she
ran
rather
than
walked
up
the
few
short
steps
of
the
porch
at
which
we
had
now
arrived
do
tell
loreen
she
begged
as
i
followed
her
into
the
house
she
worries
so
about
me
and
it
will
do
no
good
william
had
stalked
off
toward
the
stables
we
were
therefore
alone
i
turned
and
laid
a
finger
on
her
arm
my
dear
said
i
i
never
make
foolish
promises
but
i
can
be
trusted
never
to
heedlessly
slight
any
one
wishes
if
i
see
no
good
reason
why
i
should
tell
your
sister
of
this
fainting
fit
i
shall
certainly
hold
my
peace
she
seemed
moved
by
my
manner
if
not
by
my
words
oh
she
cried
seizing
my
hand
and
pressing
it
if
i
dared
to
tell
you
of
my
troubles
but
it
is
impossible
quite
impossible
and
before
i
could
urge
a
plea
for
her
confidence
she
was
gone
leaving
me
in
the
company
of
hannah
who
at
this
moment
was
busying
herself
with
something
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
i
had
no
wish
to
interfere
with
hannah
just
then
i
had
my
letter
to
read
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
so
i
slipped
into
the
and
carefully
closed
the
door
then
i
opened
my
letter
it
was
as
i
supposed
from
gryce
and
ran
thus
dear
miss
butterworth
i
am
astonished
at
your
determination
but
since
your
desire
to
visit
your
friends
is
such
as
to
lead
you
to
brave
the
dangers
of
lost
man
lane
allow
me
to
suggest
certain
precautions
do
not
trust
anybody
do
not
proceed
anywhere
alone
or
on
foot
if
danger
comes
to
you
and
you
find
yourself
in
a
condition
of
real
peril
blow
once
shrilly
on
the
whistle
i
inclose
with
this
if
however
the
danger
is
slight
or
you
wish
merely
to
call
the
attention
of
those
who
will
be
set
to
watch
over
you
let
the
blast
be
short
sharp
and
repeated
twice
to
summon
assistance
three
times
to
call
attention
i
advise
you
to
fasten
this
whistle
about
your
neck
in
a
way
to
make
it
easily
obtainable
i
have
advised
you
to
trust
nobody
i
should
have
excepted
trohm
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
be
given
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
remember
that
all
depends
upon
your
not
awakening
suspicion
if
however
you
wish
advice
or
desire
to
make
any
communication
to
me
or
the
man
secretly
holding
charge
over
this
affair
in
seek
the
first
opportunity
of
riding
into
town
and
go
at
once
to
the
hotel
where
you
will
ask
for
room
it
has
been
retained
in
your
service
and
once
shown
into
it
you
may
expect
a
visitor
who
will
be
the
man
you
seek
as
you
will
see
every
confidence
is
put
in
your
judgment
there
was
no
signature
to
this
it
needed
none
and
in
the
packet
which
came
with
it
was
the
whistle
i
was
glad
to
see
it
and
glad
to
hear
that
i
was
not
left
entirely
without
protection
in
my
somewhat
hazardous
enterprise
the
events
of
the
morning
had
been
so
unexpected
that
till
this
moment
i
had
forgotten
my
early
determination
to
go
to
my
room
before
any
change
there
could
be
made
recalling
it
now
i
started
for
the
staircase
and
did
not
stop
though
i
heard
hannah
calling
me
back
the
consequence
was
that
i
ran
full
tilt
against
miss
knollys
coming
down
the
hall
with
a
tray
in
her
hand
ah
i
cried
some
one
sick
in
the
house
the
attack
was
too
sudden
i
saw
her
recoil
and
for
one
instant
hesitate
before
replying
then
her
natural
came
to
her
aid
and
she
placidly
remarked
we
were
all
up
to
a
late
hour
last
night
as
you
know
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
have
some
food
i
accepted
the
explanation
and
made
no
further
remark
but
as
in
passing
her
i
had
detected
on
this
tray
of
food
supposed
to
have
been
sent
up
the
night
before
the
portion
of
a
certain
dish
we
had
had
for
breakfast
i
reserved
to
myself
the
privilege
of
doubting
her
exact
truthfulness
to
me
the
sight
of
this
partially
consumed
breakfast
was
proof
positive
of
there
being
in
the
house
some
person
of
whose
presence
i
was
supposed
to
be
ignorant
not
a
pleasant
thought
under
the
circumstances
but
quite
an
important
fact
to
have
established
i
felt
that
in
this
one
discovery
i
had
clutched
the
thread
that
would
yet
lead
me
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
this
mystery
miss
knollys
who
was
on
her
way
called
hannah
to
take
the
tray
and
coming
back
beckoned
me
toward
a
door
opening
into
one
of
the
front
rooms
this
is
to
be
your
room
she
announced
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
move
you
she
was
so
calm
so
perfectly
mistress
of
herself
that
i
could
not
but
admire
her
lucetta
would
have
flushed
and
fidgeted
but
loreen
stood
as
erect
and
placid
as
if
no
trouble
weighed
upon
her
heart
and
the
words
were
as
unimportant
in
their
character
as
they
seemed
do
not
distress
yourself
said
i
i
told
lucetta
last
night
that
i
was
perfectly
comfortable
and
had
no
wish
to
change
my
quarters
i
am
sorry
you
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
disturb
yourself
on
my
account
last
night
do
do
it
again
i
pray
a
woman
like
myself
had
rather
put
herself
to
some
slight
inconvenience
than
move
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
said
she
and
came
at
once
from
the
door
i
do
know
but
after
all
i
like
lucetta
fidgety
ways
better
than
loreen
unmovable
shall
i
order
the
coach
for
you
she
suddenly
asked
as
i
turned
toward
the
corridor
leading
to
my
room
the
coach
i
repeated
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
like
to
ride
into
town
simsbury
is
at
leisure
this
morning
i
regret
that
neither
lucetta
nor
myself
will
be
able
to
accompany
you
i
thought
what
this
same
simsbury
had
said
about
lucetta
plan
and
hesitated
it
was
evidently
their
wish
to
have
me
spend
my
morning
elsewhere
than
with
them
should
i
humor
them
or
find
excuses
for
remaining
home
either
course
had
its
difficulties
if
i
went
what
might
not
take
place
in
my
absence
if
i
remained
what
suspicions
might
i
not
rouse
i
decided
to
compromise
matters
and
start
for
town
even
if
i
did
not
go
there
i
am
hesitating
said
i
because
of
the
two
or
three
rather
clouds
toward
the
east
but
if
you
are
sure
simsbury
can
be
spared
i
think
i
will
risk
it
i
really
would
like
to
get
a
key
for
my
door
and
then
riding
in
the
country
is
so
pleasant
miss
knollys
with
a
bow
passed
immediately
i
went
in
a
state
of
some
doubt
toward
my
own
room
am
i
surveying
these
occurrences
through
highly
magnifying
glasses
thought
i
it
was
very
possible
yet
not
so
possible
but
that
i
cast
very
curious
glances
at
the
various
closed
doors
i
had
to
pass
before
reaching
my
own
such
a
little
thing
would
make
me
feel
like
trying
them
such
a
little
thing
that
is
added
to
the
other
things
which
had
struck
me
as
unexplainable
i
found
my
bed
made
and
everything
in
order
i
had
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
prepare
for
going
out
this
i
did
quickly
and
was
sooner
perhaps
than
i
was
expected
at
all
events
lucetta
and
william
parted
very
suddenly
when
they
saw
me
she
in
tears
and
he
with
a
dogged
shrug
and
some
such
word
as
this
you
a
fool
to
take
on
so
since
it
got
to
be
the
sooner
the
better
i
say
do
you
see
that
every
minute
makes
less
our
chances
of
concealment
it
made
me
feel
like
changing
my
mind
and
staying
home
but
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
is
not
easily
broken
into
i
kept
to
my
first
decision
xi
men
women
and
ghosts
simsbury
gave
me
quite
an
amiable
bow
as
i
entered
the
buggy
this
made
it
easy
for
me
to
say
you
are
on
hand
early
this
morning
do
you
sleep
in
the
knollys
house
the
stare
he
gave
me
had
the
least
bit
of
suspicion
in
it
i
live
over
yonder
he
said
pointing
with
his
whip
across
the
intervening
woods
to
the
main
road
i
come
through
the
marshes
to
my
breakfast
my
old
woman
says
they
owes
me
three
meals
and
three
meals
i
must
have
it
was
the
longest
sentence
with
which
he
had
honored
me
finding
him
in
a
talkative
mood
i
prepared
to
make
myself
agreeable
a
proceeding
which
he
seemed
to
appreciate
for
he
began
to
sniff
and
pay
great
attention
to
his
horse
which
he
was
elaborately
turning
about
why
do
you
go
that
way
i
protested
is
it
the
longest
way
to
the
village
it
the
way
i
most
accustomed
to
said
he
but
we
can
go
the
other
way
if
you
like
perhaps
we
will
get
a
glimpse
of
deacon
spear
he
a
widower
you
know
the
leer
with
which
he
said
this
was
intolerable
i
bridled
up
but
no
i
will
not
admit
that
i
so
much
as
manifested
by
my
manner
that
i
understood
him
i
merely
expressed
my
wish
to
go
the
old
way
he
whipped
up
the
horse
at
once
almost
laughing
outright
i
began
to
think
this
man
capable
of
most
any
wicked
deed
he
was
forced
however
to
pull
up
suddenly
directly
in
our
path
was
the
stooping
figure
of
a
woman
she
did
not
move
as
we
advanced
and
so
we
had
no
alternative
but
to
stop
not
till
the
horse
head
touched
her
shoulder
did
she
move
then
she
rose
up
and
looked
at
us
somewhat
indignantly
did
you
hear
us
i
asked
willing
to
open
conversation
with
the
old
crone
whom
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
mother
jane
she
deaf
deaf
as
a
post
muttered
simsbury
no
use
shouting
at
her
his
tone
was
brusque
yet
i
noticed
he
waited
with
great
patience
for
her
to
hobble
out
of
the
way
meanwhile
i
was
watching
the
old
creature
with
much
interest
she
had
not
a
common
face
or
a
common
manner
she
was
gray
she
was
toothless
she
was
haggard
and
she
was
bent
but
she
was
not
ordinary
or
just
one
of
the
crowd
of
old
women
to
be
seen
on
country
doorsteps
there
was
force
in
her
aged
movements
and
a
strong
individuality
in
the
glances
she
shot
at
us
as
she
backed
slowly
out
of
the
roadway
do
they
say
she
is
imbecile
i
asked
she
looks
far
from
foolish
to
me
hearken
a
bit
said
he
do
you
see
she
is
muttering
she
talks
to
herself
all
the
time
and
in
fact
her
lips
were
moving
i
can
not
hear
her
i
said
make
her
come
nearer
somehow
the
old
creature
interests
me
he
at
once
beckoned
to
the
crone
but
he
might
as
well
have
beckoned
to
the
tree
against
which
she
had
pushed
herself
she
neither
answered
him
nor
gave
any
indication
that
she
understood
the
gesture
he
had
made
yet
her
eyes
never
moved
from
our
faces
well
well
said
i
she
seems
dull
as
well
as
deaf
you
had
better
drive
on
but
before
he
could
give
the
necessary
jerk
of
the
reins
i
caught
sight
of
some
pennyroyal
growing
about
the
front
of
the
cottage
a
few
steps
beyond
and
pointing
to
it
with
some
eagerness
i
cried
if
there
is
some
of
the
very
herb
i
want
to
take
home
with
me
do
you
think
she
would
give
me
a
handful
of
it
if
i
paid
her
with
an
obliging
grunt
he
again
pulled
up
if
you
can
make
her
understand
said
he
i
thought
it
worth
the
effort
though
gryce
had
been
at
pains
to
tell
me
there
was
no
harm
in
this
woman
and
that
i
need
not
even
consider
her
in
any
inquiries
i
might
be
called
upon
to
make
i
remembered
that
gryce
had
sometimes
made
mistakes
in
just
such
matters
as
these
and
that
amelia
butterworth
had
then
felt
herself
called
upon
to
set
him
right
if
that
could
happen
once
why
not
twice
at
all
events
i
was
not
going
to
lose
the
least
chance
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
people
living
in
this
lane
had
he
not
himself
said
that
only
in
this
way
could
we
hope
to
come
upon
the
clue
that
had
eluded
all
open
efforts
to
find
it
knowing
that
the
sight
of
money
is
the
strongest
appeal
that
can
be
made
to
one
living
in
such
abject
poverty
as
this
woman
making
the
blind
to
see
and
the
deaf
to
hear
i
drew
out
my
purse
and
held
up
before
her
a
piece
of
silver
she
bounded
as
if
she
had
been
shot
and
when
i
held
it
toward
her
came
greedily
forward
and
stood
close
beside
the
wheels
looking
up
for
you
i
indicated
after
making
a
motion
toward
the
plant
which
had
attracted
my
attention
she
glanced
from
me
to
the
herb
and
nodded
with
quick
appreciation
as
in
a
flash
she
seemed
to
take
in
the
fact
that
i
was
a
stranger
a
city
lady
with
memories
of
the
country
and
this
humble
plant
and
hurrying
to
it
with
the
same
swiftness
she
had
displayed
in
advancing
to
the
carriage
she
tore
off
several
of
the
sprays
and
brought
them
back
to
me
holding
out
her
hand
for
the
money
i
had
never
seen
greater
eagerness
and
i
think
even
simsbury
was
astonished
at
this
proof
of
her
poverty
or
her
greed
i
was
inclined
to
think
it
the
latter
for
her
portly
figure
was
far
from
looking
either
or
poorly
cared
for
her
dress
was
of
decent
calico
and
her
pipe
had
evidently
been
lately
filled
for
i
could
smell
the
odor
of
tobacco
about
her
indeed
as
i
afterward
heard
the
good
people
of
had
never
allowed
her
to
suffer
yet
her
fingers
closed
upon
that
coin
as
if
in
it
she
grasped
the
salvation
of
her
life
and
into
her
eyes
leaped
a
light
that
made
her
look
almost
young
though
she
must
have
been
fully
eighty
what
do
you
suppose
she
will
do
with
that
i
asked
simsbury
as
she
turned
away
in
an
evident
fear
i
might
repent
of
my
bargain
hark
was
his
brief
response
she
is
talking
now
i
did
hearken
and
heard
these
words
fall
from
her
quickly
moving
lips
seventy
and
now
ten
jargon
for
i
had
given
her
cents
an
amount
quite
different
from
any
she
had
mentioned
seventy
she
was
repeating
the
figures
again
this
time
in
a
tone
of
almost
frenzied
elation
seventy
and
now
ten
lizzie
be
surprised
seventy
twenty
i
heard
no
more
she
had
bounded
into
her
cottage
and
shut
the
door
waal
what
do
you
think
of
her
now
chuckled
simsbury
touching
up
his
horse
she
always
like
that
saying
over
numbers
and
muttering
about
lizzie
lizzie
was
her
daughter
forty
years
ago
she
ran
off
with
a
man
from
boston
and
for
years
she
been
lying
in
a
massachusetts
grave
but
her
mother
still
thinks
she
is
alive
and
is
coming
back
nothing
will
ever
make
her
think
different
but
harmless
perfectly
harmless
you
need
be
afeard
of
her
this
because
i
cast
a
look
behind
me
of
more
than
ordinary
curiosity
i
suppose
why
were
they
all
so
sure
she
was
harmless
i
had
thought
her
expression
a
little
alarming
at
times
especially
when
she
took
the
money
from
my
hand
if
i
had
refused
it
or
even
held
it
back
a
little
i
think
she
would
have
fallen
upon
me
tooth
and
nail
i
wished
i
could
take
a
peep
into
her
cottage
gryce
had
described
it
as
four
walls
and
nothing
more
and
indeed
it
was
small
and
of
the
humblest
proportions
but
the
fluttering
of
some
pigeons
about
its
eaves
proved
it
to
be
a
home
and
as
such
of
interest
to
me
who
am
often
able
to
read
character
from
a
person
habitual
surroundings
there
was
no
yard
attached
to
this
simple
building
only
a
small
open
place
in
front
in
which
a
few
of
the
commonest
vegetables
grew
such
as
turnips
carrots
and
onions
elsewhere
towered
the
forest
the
great
pine
forest
through
which
this
portion
of
the
road
ran
simsbury
had
been
so
talkative
up
to
now
that
i
was
in
hope
he
would
enter
into
some
details
about
the
persons
and
things
we
encountered
which
might
assist
me
in
the
acquaintanceship
i
was
anxious
to
make
but
his
loquaciousness
ended
with
this
small
adventure
i
have
just
described
not
till
we
were
well
quit
of
the
pines
and
had
entered
into
the
main
thoroughfare
did
he
deign
to
respond
to
any
of
my
suggestions
and
then
it
was
in
a
manner
totally
unsatisfactory
and
quite
uncommunicative
the
only
time
he
deigned
to
offer
a
remark
was
when
we
emerged
from
the
forest
and
came
upon
the
little
crippled
child
looking
from
its
window
then
he
cried
why
how
this
that
sue
you
see
there
and
her
time
is
till
arternoon
rob
allers
sits
there
of
a
mornin
i
wonder
if
the
little
chap
sick
i
ask
as
this
was
just
what
i
would
have
suggested
if
he
had
given
me
time
i
nodded
complacently
and
we
drove
up
and
stopped
the
piping
voice
of
the
child
at
once
spoke
up
how
d
ye
do
simsbury
ma
in
the
kitchen
rob
is
feelin
good
i
thought
her
tone
had
a
touch
of
mysteriousness
in
it
i
greeted
the
pale
little
thing
and
asked
if
rob
was
often
sick
never
she
answered
except
like
me
he
ca
walk
but
i
not
to
talk
about
it
ma
says
i
like
to
but
ma
face
appearing
at
this
moment
over
her
shoulder
put
an
end
to
her
innocent
garrulity
how
d
ye
do
mr
simsbury
came
a
second
time
from
the
window
but
this
time
in
very
different
tones
what
the
child
been
saying
so
sot
up
at
being
allowed
to
take
her
brother
place
in
the
winder
that
she
do
know
how
to
keep
her
tongue
still
rob
a
little
languid
that
all
you
see
him
in
his
old
place
and
she
drew
back
as
if
in
polite
intimation
that
we
might
drive
on
simsbury
responded
to
the
suggestion
and
in
another
moment
we
were
trotting
down
the
road
had
we
stayed
a
minute
longer
i
think
the
child
would
have
said
something
more
or
less
interesting
to
hear
the
horse
which
had
brought
us
thus
far
at
a
pretty
sharp
trot
now
began
to
lag
which
so
attracted
simsbury
attention
that
he
forgot
to
answer
even
by
a
grunt
more
than
half
of
my
questions
he
spent
most
of
his
time
looking
at
the
nag
hind
feet
and
finally
just
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
stores
he
found
his
tongue
sufficiently
to
announce
that
the
horse
was
casting
a
shoe
and
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
blacksmith
with
her
humph
and
how
long
will
that
take
i
asked
he
hesitated
so
long
rubbing
his
nose
with
his
finger
that
i
grew
suspicious
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
horse
foot
myself
the
shoe
was
loose
i
began
to
hear
it
clang
waal
it
may
be
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
hours
he
finally
drawled
we
have
no
blacksmith
in
town
and
the
ride
up
there
is
two
miles
sorry
it
happened
but
there
all
sorts
of
shops
here
you
see
and
allers
heard
that
a
woman
can
easily
spend
two
hours
haggling
away
in
shops
i
glanced
at
the
two
windows
he
pointed
out
thought
of
arnold
constable
tiffany
and
the
other
new
york
establishments
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
and
suppressed
my
disdain
either
the
man
was
a
fool
or
he
was
acting
a
part
in
the
interests
of
lucetta
and
her
family
i
rather
inclined
to
the
latter
supposition
if
the
plan
was
to
keep
me
out
most
of
the
morning
why
could
that
shoe
not
have
been
loosened
before
the
mare
left
the
stable
i
made
all
necessary
purchases
while
in
new
york
said
i
but
if
you
must
get
the
horse
shod
why
take
her
off
and
do
it
i
suppose
there
is
a
hotel
parlor
near
here
where
i
can
sit
oh
yes
and
he
made
haste
to
point
out
to
me
where
the
hotel
stood
and
it
a
very
nice
place
carter
the
landlady
is
the
nicest
sort
of
person
only
you
wo
try
to
go
home
on
foot
you
wait
till
i
come
back
for
you
it
is
likely
i
go
streaking
through
lost
man
lane
alone
i
exclaimed
indignantly
i
rather
sit
in
carter
parlor
till
night
and
i
would
advise
you
to
he
said
no
use
making
gossip
for
the
village
folks
they
have
enough
to
talk
about
as
it
is
not
exactly
seeing
the
force
of
this
reasoning
but
quite
willing
to
be
left
to
my
own
devices
for
a
little
while
i
pointed
to
a
shop
i
saw
near
by
and
bade
him
put
me
down
there
with
a
sniff
i
declined
to
interpret
into
a
token
of
disapproval
he
drove
me
up
to
the
shop
and
awkwardly
assisted
me
to
alight
trunk
key
missing
he
ventured
to
inquire
before
getting
back
into
his
seat
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
reply
but
walked
immediately
into
the
shop
he
looked
dissatisfied
at
this
but
whatever
his
feelings
were
he
refrained
from
any
expression
of
them
and
presently
mounted
to
his
place
and
drove
off
i
was
left
confronting
the
decent
man
who
represented
the
interests
in
i
found
some
difficulty
in
broaching
my
errand
finally
i
said
miss
knollys
who
lives
up
the
road
wishes
a
key
fitted
to
one
of
her
doors
will
you
come
or
send
a
man
to
her
house
she
is
too
occupied
to
see
about
it
herself
the
man
must
have
been
struck
by
my
appearance
for
he
stared
at
me
quite
curiously
for
a
minute
then
he
gave
a
hem
and
a
haw
and
said
certainly
what
kind
of
a
door
is
it
when
i
had
answered
he
gave
me
another
curious
glance
and
seemed
uneasy
to
step
back
to
where
his
assistant
was
working
with
a
file
you
will
be
sure
to
come
in
time
to
have
the
lock
fitted
before
night
i
said
in
that
peremptory
manner
of
mine
which
means
simply
i
keep
my
promises
and
expect
you
to
keep
yours
his
certainly
struck
me
as
a
little
weaker
this
time
possibly
because
his
curiosity
was
excited
are
you
the
lady
from
new
york
who
is
staying
with
them
he
asked
stepping
back
seemingly
quite
unawed
by
my
positive
demeanor
yes
said
i
thawing
a
trifle
i
am
miss
butterworth
he
looked
at
me
almost
as
if
i
were
a
curiosity
and
did
you
sleep
there
last
night
he
urged
i
thought
it
best
to
thaw
still
more
of
course
i
said
where
do
you
think
i
would
sleep
the
young
ladies
are
friends
of
mine
he
rapped
abstractedly
on
the
counter
with
a
small
key
he
was
holding
excuse
me
said
he
with
some
remembrance
of
my
position
toward
him
as
a
stranger
but
were
you
afraid
afraid
i
echoed
afraid
in
miss
knollys
house
why
then
do
you
want
a
key
to
your
door
he
asked
with
a
slight
appearance
of
excitement
we
do
lock
doors
here
in
the
village
at
least
we
did
i
did
not
say
it
was
my
door
i
began
but
feeling
that
this
was
a
prevarication
not
only
unworthy
of
me
but
one
that
he
was
entirely
too
sharp
to
accept
i
added
stiffly
it
is
for
my
door
i
am
not
accustomed
even
at
home
to
sleep
with
my
room
unlocked
oh
he
murmured
totally
unconvinced
i
thought
you
might
have
got
a
scare
folks
somehow
are
afraid
of
that
old
place
it
so
big
and
i
do
think
you
would
find
any
one
in
this
village
who
would
sleep
there
all
night
a
pleasing
preparation
for
my
rest
i
grimly
laughed
dangers
on
the
road
and
ghosts
in
the
house
happily
i
do
believe
in
the
latter
the
gesture
he
made
showed
incredulity
he
had
ceased
rapping
with
the
key
or
even
to
show
any
wish
to
join
his
assistant
all
his
thoughts
for
the
moment
seemed
to
be
concentrated
on
me
you
do
know
little
rob
he
inquired
the
crippled
lad
who
lives
at
the
head
of
the
lane
no
i
said
i
have
been
in
town
a
day
yet
but
i
mean
to
know
rob
and
his
sister
too
two
cripples
in
one
family
rouse
my
interest
he
did
not
say
why
he
had
spoken
of
the
child
but
began
tapping
with
his
key
again
and
you
are
sure
you
saw
nothing
he
whispered
lots
of
things
can
happen
in
a
lonely
road
like
that
not
if
everybody
is
as
afraid
to
enter
it
as
you
say
your
villagers
are
i
retorted
but
he
did
yield
a
jot
some
folks
do
mind
present
dangers
said
he
spirits
but
he
received
no
encouragement
in
his
return
to
this
topic
you
believe
in
spirits
said
he
well
they
are
doubtful
sort
of
folks
but
when
honest
and
respectable
people
such
as
live
in
this
town
when
children
even
see
what
answers
to
nothing
but
phantoms
then
i
remember
what
a
wiser
man
than
any
of
us
once
said
but
perhaps
you
do
read
shakespeare
madam
nonplussed
for
the
moment
but
interested
in
the
man
talk
more
than
was
consistent
with
my
need
of
haste
i
said
with
some
spirit
for
it
struck
me
as
very
ridiculous
that
this
country
mechanic
should
question
my
knowledge
of
the
greatest
dramatist
of
all
time
shakespeare
and
the
bible
form
the
staple
of
my
reading
at
which
he
gave
me
a
little
nod
of
apology
and
hastened
to
say
then
you
know
what
i
mean
hamlet
remark
to
horatio
madam
are
more
things
etc
your
memory
will
readily
supply
you
with
the
words
i
signified
my
satisfaction
and
perfect
comprehension
of
his
meaning
and
feeling
that
something
important
lay
behind
his
words
i
endeavored
to
make
him
speak
more
explicitly
the
misses
knollys
show
no
terror
of
their
home
i
observed
they
can
not
believe
in
spirits
either
miss
knollys
is
a
woman
of
a
great
deal
of
character
said
he
but
look
at
lucetta
there
is
a
face
for
you
for
a
girl
not
yet
out
of
her
twenties
and
such
a
lass
as
she
was
once
now
what
has
made
the
change
the
sights
and
sounds
of
that
old
house
i
say
nothing
else
would
give
her
that
scared
look
nothing
merely
mortal
i
mean
this
was
going
a
step
too
far
i
could
not
discuss
lucetta
with
this
stranger
anxious
as
i
was
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
her
i
do
know
i
remonstrated
taking
up
my
black
satin
bag
without
which
i
never
stir
one
would
think
the
terrors
of
the
lane
she
lives
in
might
account
for
some
appearance
of
fear
on
her
part
so
it
might
he
assented
but
with
no
great
heartiness
but
lucetta
has
never
spoken
of
those
dangers
the
people
in
the
lane
do
not
seem
to
fear
them
even
deacon
spear
says
that
set
aside
the
wickedness
of
the
thing
he
rather
enjoys
the
quiet
which
the
ill
repute
of
the
lane
gives
him
i
do
understand
this
indifference
myself
i
have
no
relish
for
horrible
mysteries
or
for
ghosts
either
you
wo
forget
the
key
i
suggested
shortly
preparing
to
walk
out
in
my
dread
lest
he
should
again
introduce
the
subject
of
lucetta
no
said
he
i
wo
forget
it
his
tone
should
have
warned
me
that
i
need
not
expect
to
have
a
locked
door
that
night
xii
the
phantom
coach
ghosts
what
could
the
fellow
have
meant
if
i
had
pressed
him
he
would
have
told
me
but
it
did
not
seem
quite
a
lady
business
to
pick
up
information
in
this
way
especially
when
it
involved
a
young
lady
like
lucetta
yet
did
i
think
i
would
ever
come
to
the
end
of
this
matter
without
involving
lucetta
no
why
then
did
i
allow
my
instincts
to
triumph
over
my
judgment
let
those
answer
who
understand
the
workings
of
the
human
heart
i
am
simply
stating
facts
ghosts
somehow
the
word
startled
me
as
if
in
some
way
it
gave
a
rather
unwelcome
confirmation
to
my
doubts
apparitions
seen
in
the
knollys
mansion
or
in
any
of
the
houses
bordering
on
this
lane
that
was
a
serious
charge
how
serious
seemed
to
be
but
half
comprehended
by
this
man
but
i
comprehended
it
to
the
full
and
wondered
if
it
was
on
account
of
such
gossip
as
this
that
gryce
had
persuaded
me
to
enter
miss
knollys
house
as
a
guest
i
was
crossing
the
street
to
the
hotel
as
i
indulged
in
these
conjectures
and
intent
as
my
mind
was
upon
them
i
could
not
but
note
the
curiosity
and
interest
which
my
presence
excited
in
the
simple
country
folk
invariably
to
be
found
lounging
about
a
country
tavern
indeed
the
whole
neighborhood
seemed
agog
and
though
i
would
have
thought
it
derogatory
to
my
dignity
to
notice
the
fact
i
could
not
but
see
how
many
faces
were
peering
at
me
from
store
doors
and
the
blinds
of
adjoining
cottages
no
young
girl
in
the
pride
of
her
beauty
could
have
awakened
more
interest
and
this
i
attributed
as
was
no
doubt
right
not
to
my
appearance
which
would
not
perhaps
be
apt
to
strike
these
simple
villagers
as
remarkable
or
to
my
dress
which
is
rather
rich
than
fashionable
but
to
the
fact
that
i
was
a
stranger
in
town
and
what
was
more
extraordinary
a
guest
of
the
misses
knollys
my
intention
in
approaching
the
hotel
was
not
to
spend
a
couple
of
dreary
hours
in
the
parlor
with
carter
as
simsbury
had
suggested
but
to
obtain
if
possible
a
conveyance
to
carry
me
immediately
back
to
the
knollys
mansion
but
this
which
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
in
most
towns
seemed
an
impossibility
in
x
the
landlord
was
away
and
carter
who
was
very
frank
with
me
told
me
it
would
be
perfectly
useless
to
ask
one
of
the
men
to
drive
me
through
the
lane
it
an
unwholesome
spot
said
she
and
only
carter
and
the
police
have
the
courage
to
brave
it
i
suggested
that
i
was
willing
to
pay
well
but
it
seemed
to
make
very
little
difference
to
her
money
wo
hire
them
said
she
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
lucetta
had
triumphed
in
her
plan
and
that
after
all
i
must
sit
out
the
morning
in
the
precincts
of
the
hotel
parlor
with
carter
it
was
my
first
signal
defeat
but
i
was
determined
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
if
possible
glean
such
knowledge
from
the
talk
of
this
woman
as
would
make
me
feel
that
i
had
lost
nothing
by
my
disappointment
she
was
only
too
ready
to
talk
and
the
first
topic
was
little
rob
i
saw
the
moment
i
mentioned
his
name
that
i
was
introducing
a
subject
which
had
already
been
well
talked
over
by
every
eager
gossip
in
the
village
her
attitude
of
importance
the
air
of
mystery
she
assumed
were
preparations
i
had
long
been
accustomed
to
in
women
of
this
kind
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
she
announced
in
a
way
that
admitted
of
no
dispute
oh
there
no
wonder
the
child
is
sick
we
would
be
sick
under
the
circumstances
has
seen
the
phantom
the
phantom
coach
so
that
was
what
the
locksmith
meant
a
phantom
coach
i
had
heard
of
every
kind
of
phantom
but
that
somehow
the
idea
was
a
thrilling
one
or
would
have
been
to
a
nature
less
practical
than
mine
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
i
some
superstition
of
the
place
i
never
heard
of
a
ghostly
appearance
of
that
nature
before
no
i
expect
not
it
belongs
to
i
never
heard
of
it
beyond
these
mountains
indeed
i
have
never
known
it
to
have
been
seen
but
upon
one
road
i
need
not
mention
what
road
madam
you
can
guess
yes
i
could
guess
and
the
guessing
made
me
set
my
lips
a
little
grimly
tell
me
more
about
this
thing
i
urged
half
laughing
it
ought
to
be
of
some
interest
to
me
she
nodded
drew
her
chair
a
trifle
nearer
and
impetuously
began
you
see
this
is
a
very
old
town
it
has
more
than
one
ancient
country
house
similar
to
the
one
you
are
now
living
in
and
it
has
its
early
traditions
one
is
that
an
coach
perfectly
noiseless
drawn
by
horses
through
which
you
can
see
the
moonlight
haunts
the
highroad
at
intervals
and
flies
through
the
gloomy
forest
road
we
have
christened
of
late
years
lost
man
lane
it
is
a
superstition
possibly
but
you
can
not
find
many
families
in
town
but
believe
in
it
as
a
fact
for
there
is
not
an
old
man
or
woman
in
the
place
but
has
either
seen
it
in
the
past
or
has
had
some
relative
who
has
seen
it
it
passes
only
at
night
and
it
is
thought
to
presage
some
disaster
to
those
who
see
it
my
husband
uncle
died
the
next
morning
after
it
flew
by
him
on
the
highway
fortunately
years
elapse
between
its
going
and
coming
it
is
ten
years
i
think
they
say
since
it
was
last
seen
poor
little
rob
it
has
frightened
him
almost
out
of
his
wits
i
should
think
so
i
cried
with
becoming
credulity
but
how
came
he
to
see
it
i
thought
you
said
it
only
passed
at
night
at
midnight
she
repeated
but
rob
you
see
is
a
nervous
lad
and
night
before
last
he
was
so
restless
he
could
not
sleep
so
he
begged
to
be
put
in
the
window
to
cool
off
this
his
mother
did
and
he
sat
there
for
a
good
alone
looking
out
at
the
moonlight
as
his
mother
is
an
economical
woman
there
was
no
candle
lit
in
the
room
so
he
got
his
pleasure
out
of
the
shadows
which
the
great
trees
made
on
the
highroad
when
suddenly
you
ought
to
hear
the
little
fellow
tell
it
he
felt
the
hair
rise
on
his
forehead
and
all
his
body
grow
stiff
with
a
terror
that
made
his
tongue
feel
like
lead
in
his
mouth
a
something
he
would
have
called
a
horse
and
a
carriage
in
the
daytime
but
which
in
this
light
and
under
the
influence
of
the
mortal
terror
he
was
in
took
on
a
distorted
shape
which
made
it
unlike
any
team
he
was
accustomed
to
was
going
by
not
as
if
being
driven
over
the
earth
and
stones
of
the
road
though
there
was
a
driver
in
front
a
driver
with
an
odd
hat
on
his
head
and
a
cloak
about
his
shoulders
such
as
the
little
fellow
remembered
to
have
seen
hanging
in
his
closet
but
as
if
it
floated
along
without
sound
or
stir
in
fact
a
spectre
team
which
seemed
to
find
its
proper
destination
when
it
turned
into
lost
man
lane
and
was
lost
among
the
shadows
of
that
road
pshaw
was
my
spirited
comment
as
she
paused
to
take
her
breath
and
see
how
i
was
affected
by
this
grewsome
tale
a
dream
of
the
poor
little
lad
he
had
heard
stories
of
this
apparition
and
his
imagination
supplied
the
rest
no
excuse
me
madam
he
had
been
carefully
kept
from
hearing
all
such
tales
you
could
see
this
by
the
way
he
told
his
story
he
hardly
believed
what
he
had
himself
seen
it
was
not
till
some
foolish
neighbor
blurted
out
that
was
the
phantom
coach
that
he
had
any
idea
he
was
not
relating
a
dream
my
second
was
no
less
marked
than
the
first
he
did
know
about
it
notwithstanding
i
insisted
only
he
had
forgotten
the
fact
sleep
often
supplies
us
with
these
lost
memories
very
true
and
your
supposition
is
very
plausible
miss
butterworth
and
might
be
regarded
as
correct
if
he
had
been
the
only
person
to
see
this
apparition
but
jenkins
saw
it
too
and
she
is
a
woman
to
be
believed
this
was
becoming
serious
saw
it
before
he
did
or
afterwards
i
asked
does
she
live
on
the
highway
or
somewhere
in
lost
man
lane
she
lives
on
the
highway
about
a
from
the
station
she
was
sitting
up
with
her
sick
husband
and
saw
it
just
as
it
was
going
down
the
hill
she
said
it
made
no
more
noise
than
a
cloud
slipping
by
she
expects
to
lose
old
rause
no
one
could
behold
such
a
thing
as
that
and
not
have
some
misfortune
follow
i
laid
all
this
up
in
my
mind
my
hour
of
waiting
was
not
likely
to
prove
wholly
unprofitable
you
see
the
good
woman
went
on
with
a
relish
for
the
marvellous
that
stood
me
in
good
stead
there
is
an
old
tradition
of
that
road
connected
with
a
coach
years
ago
before
any
of
us
were
born
and
the
house
where
you
are
now
staying
was
a
for
all
the
gay
young
bloods
of
the
county
a
young
man
came
up
from
new
york
to
visit
knollys
i
do
not
mean
the
father
or
even
the
grandfather
of
the
folks
you
are
visiting
he
was
to
lucetta
and
a
very
fine
gentleman
if
you
can
trust
the
pictures
that
are
left
of
him
but
my
story
has
not
to
do
with
him
he
had
a
daughter
at
that
time
a
widow
of
great
and
sparkling
attractions
and
though
she
was
older
than
the
young
man
i
have
mentioned
every
one
thought
he
would
marry
her
she
was
so
handsome
and
such
an
heiress
but
he
failed
to
pay
his
court
to
her
and
though
he
was
handsome
himself
and
made
a
fool
of
more
than
one
girl
in
the
town
every
one
thought
he
would
return
as
he
had
come
a
bachelor
when
suddenly
one
night
the
coach
was
missed
from
the
stables
and
he
from
the
company
which
led
to
the
discovery
that
the
young
widow
daughter
was
gone
too
a
chit
who
was
barely
fifteen
and
without
a
hundredth
part
of
the
beauty
of
her
mother
love
only
could
account
for
this
for
in
those
days
young
ladies
did
not
ride
with
gentlemen
in
the
evening
for
pleasure
and
when
it
came
to
the
old
gentleman
ears
and
what
was
worse
came
to
the
mother
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
great
house
the
echoes
of
which
some
say
have
never
died
out
though
the
pipers
were
playing
and
the
fiddles
were
squeaking
in
the
great
room
where
they
used
to
dance
the
night
away
knollys
with
her
white
brocade
tucked
up
about
her
waist
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
great
front
door
waiting
for
the
horse
upon
which
she
was
determined
to
follow
the
flying
lovers
the
father
who
was
a
man
of
eighty
years
stood
by
her
side
he
was
too
old
to
ride
himself
but
he
made
no
effort
to
hold
her
back
though
the
jewels
were
tumbling
from
her
hair
and
the
moon
had
vanished
from
the
highway
will
bring
her
back
or
die
the
passionate
beauty
exclaimed
and
not
a
lip
said
her
nay
for
they
saw
what
neither
man
nor
woman
had
been
able
to
see
up
to
that
moment
that
her
very
life
and
soul
were
wrapped
up
in
the
man
who
had
stolen
away
her
daughter
shrilly
piped
the
pipes
squeak
and
hum
went
the
fiddles
but
the
sound
that
was
sweetest
to
her
was
the
pound
of
the
horses
hoofs
on
the
road
in
front
that
was
music
indeed
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
it
she
bestowed
one
wild
kiss
on
her
father
and
bounded
from
the
house
an
instant
later
and
she
was
gone
one
flash
of
her
white
robe
at
the
gate
then
all
was
dark
on
the
highway
and
only
the
old
father
stood
in
the
door
waiting
as
he
vowed
he
would
wait
till
his
daughter
returned
she
did
not
go
alone
a
faithful
groom
was
behind
her
and
from
him
was
learned
the
conclusion
of
that
quest
for
an
hour
and
a
half
they
rode
then
they
came
upon
a
chapel
in
the
mountains
in
which
were
burning
unwonted
lights
at
the
sight
the
lady
drew
rein
and
almost
fell
from
her
horse
into
the
arms
of
her
lackey
marriage
she
murmured
marriage
and
pointed
to
an
empty
coach
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
it
was
their
family
coach
how
well
she
knew
it
rousing
herself
she
made
for
the
chapel
door
will
stop
these
unhallowed
rites
she
cried
am
her
mother
and
she
is
not
of
age
but
the
lackey
drew
her
back
by
her
rich
white
dress
he
cried
pointing
in
at
one
of
the
windows
and
she
looked
the
man
she
loved
stood
before
the
altar
with
her
daughter
he
was
smiling
in
that
daughter
face
with
a
look
of
passionate
devotion
it
went
like
a
dagger
to
her
heart
crushing
her
hands
against
her
face
she
wailed
out
some
fearful
protest
then
she
dashed
toward
the
door
with
stop
on
her
lips
but
the
faithful
lackey
at
her
side
drew
her
back
once
more
was
his
word
and
she
listened
the
minister
whose
form
she
had
failed
to
note
in
her
first
hurried
look
was
uttering
his
benediction
she
had
come
too
late
the
young
couple
were
married
her
servant
said
or
so
the
tradition
runs
that
when
she
realized
this
she
grew
calm
as
walking
death
making
her
way
into
the
chapel
she
stood
ready
at
the
door
to
greet
them
as
they
issued
forth
and
when
they
saw
her
there
with
her
rich
bedraggled
robe
and
the
gleam
of
jewels
on
a
neck
she
had
not
even
stopped
to
envelop
in
more
than
the
veil
from
her
hair
the
bridegroom
seemed
to
realize
what
he
had
done
and
stopped
the
bride
who
in
her
confusion
would
have
fled
back
to
the
altar
where
she
had
just
been
made
a
wife
he
cried
amarynth
only
thus
can
we
ask
pardon
of
our
mother
but
at
that
word
a
word
which
seemed
to
push
her
a
million
miles
away
from
these
two
beings
who
but
two
hours
before
had
been
the
delight
of
her
life
the
unhappy
woman
gave
a
cry
and
fled
from
their
presence
go
were
her
parting
words
you
have
chosen
you
must
abide
but
let
no
tongue
ever
again
call
me
mother
they
found
her
lying
on
the
grass
outside
as
she
could
no
longer
sustain
herself
on
a
horse
they
put
her
into
the
coach
gave
the
reins
to
her
devoted
lackey
and
themselves
rode
off
on
horseback
one
man
the
fellow
who
had
driven
them
to
that
place
said
that
the
clock
struck
twelve
from
the
chapel
tower
as
the
coach
turned
away
and
began
its
rapid
journey
home
this
may
and
may
not
be
so
we
only
know
that
its
apparition
always
enters
lost
man
lane
a
few
minutes
before
one
which
is
the
very
hour
at
which
the
real
coach
came
back
and
stopped
before
knollys
gate
and
now
for
the
worst
miss
butterworth
when
the
old
gentleman
went
down
to
greet
the
runaways
he
found
the
lackey
on
the
box
and
his
daughter
sitting
all
alone
in
the
coach
but
the
soil
on
the
brocaded
folds
of
her
white
dress
was
no
longer
that
of
mud
only
she
had
stabbed
herself
to
the
heart
with
a
bodkin
she
wore
in
her
hair
and
it
was
a
corpse
which
the
faithful
negro
had
been
driving
down
the
highway
that
night
i
am
not
a
sentimental
woman
but
this
story
as
thus
told
gave
me
a
thrill
i
do
not
know
as
i
really
regret
experiencing
what
was
this
unhappy
mother
name
i
asked
lucetta
was
the
unexpected
and
none
too
reassuring
answer
xiii
gossip
this
name
once
mentioned
called
for
more
gossip
but
of
a
somewhat
different
nature
the
lucetta
of
is
not
like
her
ancient
namesake
observed
carter
she
may
have
the
heart
to
love
but
she
is
not
capable
of
showing
that
love
by
any
act
of
daring
i
do
know
about
that
i
replied
astonished
that
i
felt
willing
to
enter
into
a
discussion
with
this
woman
on
the
very
subject
i
had
just
shrunk
from
talking
over
with
the
locksmith
girls
as
frail
and
nervous
as
she
is
sometimes
astonish
one
at
a
pinch
i
do
not
think
lucetta
lacks
daring
you
do
know
her
why
i
have
seen
her
jump
at
the
sight
of
a
spider
and
heaven
knows
that
they
are
common
enough
among
the
decaying
walls
in
which
she
lives
a
puny
chit
miss
butterworth
pretty
enough
but
weak
the
very
kind
to
draw
lovers
but
not
to
hold
them
yet
every
one
pities
her
her
smile
is
so
with
ghosts
to
trouble
her
and
a
lover
to
bemoan
she
has
surely
some
excuse
for
that
said
i
yes
i
do
deny
it
but
why
has
she
a
lover
to
bemoan
he
seemed
a
proper
man
and
much
beyond
the
ordinary
why
let
him
go
as
she
did
even
her
sister
admits
that
she
loved
him
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
i
suggested
well
there
is
much
of
a
story
to
it
he
is
a
young
man
from
over
the
mountains
well
educated
and
with
something
of
a
fortune
of
his
own
he
came
here
to
visit
the
spears
i
believe
and
seeing
lucetta
leaning
one
day
on
the
gate
in
front
of
her
house
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
began
to
pay
her
his
attentions
that
was
before
the
lane
got
its
present
bad
name
but
not
before
one
or
two
men
had
vanished
from
among
us
william
that
is
her
brother
you
know
has
always
been
anxious
to
have
his
sisters
marry
so
he
did
not
stand
in
the
way
and
no
more
did
miss
knollys
but
after
two
or
three
weeks
of
doubtful
courtship
the
young
man
went
away
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
a
great
pity
too
say
i
for
once
clear
of
that
house
lucetta
would
grow
into
another
person
sunshine
and
love
are
necessities
to
most
women
miss
butterworth
especially
to
such
as
are
weakly
and
timid
i
thought
the
qualification
excellent
you
are
right
i
assented
and
i
should
like
to
see
the
result
of
them
upon
lucetta
then
with
an
attempt
to
still
further
sound
this
woman
mind
and
with
it
the
united
mind
of
the
whole
village
i
remarked
the
young
do
not
usually
throw
aside
such
prospects
without
excellent
reasons
have
you
never
thought
that
lucetta
was
governed
by
principle
in
discarding
this
very
excellent
young
man
principle
what
principle
could
she
have
had
in
letting
a
desirable
husband
go
she
may
have
thought
the
match
an
undesirable
one
for
him
for
him
well
i
never
thought
of
that
true
she
may
they
are
known
to
be
poor
but
poverty
do
count
in
such
old
families
as
theirs
i
hardly
think
she
would
be
influenced
by
any
such
consideration
now
if
this
had
happened
since
the
lane
got
its
bad
name
and
all
this
stir
had
been
made
about
the
disappearance
of
certain
folks
within
its
precincts
i
might
have
given
some
weight
to
your
suggestion
women
are
so
queer
but
this
happened
long
ago
and
at
a
time
when
the
family
was
highly
thought
of
leastwise
the
girls
for
william
does
not
go
for
much
you
know
too
stupid
and
too
brutal
william
would
the
utterance
of
that
name
heighten
my
suggestion
i
surveyed
her
closely
but
could
detect
no
change
in
her
somewhat
puzzled
countenance
my
allusions
were
not
in
reference
to
the
disappearances
said
i
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
lucetta
is
not
well
ah
i
know
they
say
she
has
some
kind
of
heart
complaint
but
that
was
not
true
then
why
her
cheeks
were
like
roses
in
those
days
and
her
figure
as
plump
and
pretty
as
any
you
could
see
among
our
village
beauties
no
miss
butterworth
it
was
through
her
weakness
she
lost
him
she
probably
palled
upon
his
taste
it
was
noticed
that
he
held
his
head
very
high
in
going
out
of
town
has
he
married
since
i
asked
not
to
my
knowledge
then
he
loved
her
i
declared
she
looked
at
me
quite
curiously
doubtless
that
word
sounds
a
little
queer
on
my
lips
but
that
shall
not
deter
me
from
using
it
when
the
circumstances
seem
to
require
besides
there
was
once
a
time
but
there
i
promised
to
fall
into
no
digressions
you
should
have
been
married
yourself
miss
butterworth
said
she
i
was
amazed
first
at
her
daring
and
secondly
that
i
was
so
little
angry
at
this
sudden
turning
of
the
tables
upon
myself
but
then
the
woman
meant
no
offence
rather
intended
a
compliment
i
am
very
well
contented
as
i
am
i
returned
am
neither
sickly
nor
timid
she
smiled
looked
as
if
she
thought
it
only
common
politeness
to
agree
with
me
and
tried
to
say
so
but
finding
the
situation
too
much
for
her
coughed
and
discreetly
held
her
peace
i
came
to
her
rescue
with
a
new
question
have
the
women
of
the
knollys
family
ever
been
successful
in
love
the
mother
of
these
girls
say
she
who
was
miss
althea
burroughs
was
her
life
with
her
husband
happy
i
have
always
been
curious
to
know
she
and
i
were
schoolmates
you
were
you
knew
althea
knollys
when
she
was
a
girl
was
she
charming
did
you
ever
see
a
livelier
girl
or
one
with
more
knack
at
winning
affection
why
she
could
sit
down
with
you
a
before
you
felt
like
sharing
everything
you
had
with
her
it
made
no
difference
whether
you
were
man
or
woman
it
was
all
the
same
she
had
but
to
turn
those
mischievous
pleading
eyes
upon
you
for
you
to
become
a
fool
at
once
yet
her
end
was
sad
too
sad
when
you
remember
that
she
died
at
the
very
height
of
her
beauty
alone
and
in
a
foreign
land
but
i
have
not
answered
your
question
were
she
and
the
judge
happy
together
i
have
never
heard
to
the
contrary
i
sure
he
mourned
her
faithfully
enough
some
think
that
her
loss
killed
him
he
did
not
survive
her
more
than
three
years
the
children
do
not
favor
her
much
said
i
but
i
see
an
expression
now
and
then
in
lucetta
which
reminds
me
of
her
mother
they
are
all
knollys
said
she
even
william
has
traits
which
with
a
few
more
brains
back
of
them
would
remind
you
of
his
grandfather
who
was
the
plainest
of
his
race
i
was
glad
that
the
talk
had
reverted
to
william
he
seems
to
lack
heart
as
well
as
brains
i
said
i
marvel
that
his
sisters
put
up
with
him
as
well
as
they
do
they
can
not
help
it
he
is
not
a
fellow
to
be
fooled
with
besides
he
holds
third
share
in
the
house
if
they
could
sell
it
but
deary
me
who
would
buy
an
old
place
like
that
on
a
road
you
can
not
get
folks
who
have
any
consideration
for
their
lives
to
enter
for
love
or
money
but
excuse
me
i
forgot
that
you
are
living
just
now
on
that
very
road
i
sure
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
am
living
there
as
a
guest
i
returned
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
reputation
except
to
brave
it
a
courageous
thing
to
do
and
one
that
may
do
the
road
some
good
if
you
can
spend
a
month
with
the
knollys
girls
and
come
out
of
their
house
at
the
end
as
hale
and
hearty
as
you
entered
it
it
will
be
the
best
proof
possible
that
there
is
less
to
be
feared
there
than
some
people
think
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
can
do
it
for
i
like
the
girls
and
would
be
glad
to
have
the
reputation
of
the
place
restored
pshaw
was
my
final
comment
the
credulity
of
the
town
has
had
as
much
to
do
with
its
loss
as
they
themselves
that
educated
people
such
as
i
see
here
should
believe
in
ghosts
i
say
final
for
at
this
moment
the
good
lady
springing
up
put
an
end
to
our
conversation
she
had
just
seen
a
buggy
pass
the
window
it
trohm
she
exclaimed
if
you
wish
to
return
home
before
simsbury
comes
back
you
may
be
able
to
do
so
with
this
gentleman
he
a
most
obliging
man
and
lives
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
misses
knollys
i
did
not
say
i
had
already
met
the
gentleman
why
i
do
not
know
i
only
drew
myself
up
and
waited
with
some
small
inner
perturbation
for
the
result
of
the
inquiry
i
saw
she
had
gone
to
make
xiv
i
forget
my
age
or
rather
remember
it
trohm
did
not
disappoint
my
expectations
in
another
moment
i
perceived
him
standing
in
the
open
doorway
with
the
most
genial
smile
on
his
lips
miss
butterworth
said
he
i
feel
too
honored
if
you
will
deign
to
accept
a
seat
in
my
buggy
i
shall
only
be
too
happy
to
drive
you
home
i
have
always
liked
the
manners
of
country
gentlemen
there
is
just
a
touch
of
formality
in
their
bearing
which
has
been
quite
eliminated
from
that
of
their
city
brothers
i
therefore
became
gracious
at
once
and
accepted
the
seat
he
offered
me
without
any
hesitation
the
heads
that
showed
themselves
at
the
neighboring
windows
warned
us
to
hasten
on
our
route
trohm
with
a
snap
of
his
whip
touched
up
his
horse
and
we
rode
in
dignified
calm
away
from
the
hotel
steps
into
the
wide
village
street
known
as
the
main
road
the
fact
that
gryce
had
told
me
that
this
was
the
one
man
i
could
trust
joined
to
my
own
excellent
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
the
persons
in
whom
explicit
confidence
can
be
put
made
the
moment
one
of
great
satisfaction
to
me
i
was
about
to
make
my
appearance
at
the
knollys
mansion
two
hours
before
i
was
expected
and
thus
outwit
lucetta
by
means
of
the
one
man
whose
assistance
i
could
conscientiously
accept
we
were
not
slow
in
beginning
conversation
the
fine
air
the
prosperous
condition
of
the
town
offered
themes
upon
which
we
found
it
quite
easy
to
dilate
and
so
naturally
and
easily
did
our
acquaintanceship
progress
that
we
had
turned
the
corner
into
lost
man
lane
before
i
quite
realized
it
the
entrance
from
the
village
offered
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
one
i
had
already
traversed
there
it
was
but
a
narrow
opening
between
sombre
and
unduly
crowding
trees
here
it
was
the
gradual
melting
of
a
village
street
into
a
narrow
and
less
frequented
road
which
only
after
passing
deacon
spear
house
assumed
that
aspect
of
wildness
which
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
deepened
into
something
positively
sombre
and
repellent
i
speak
of
deacon
spear
because
he
was
sitting
on
his
front
doorstep
when
we
rode
by
as
he
was
a
resident
in
the
lane
i
did
not
fail
to
take
notice
of
him
though
guardedly
and
with
such
restraint
as
a
knowledge
of
his
widowed
condition
rendered
both
wise
and
proper
he
was
not
an
person
at
least
to
me
his
hair
was
sleek
his
beard
well
cared
for
his
whole
person
in
good
if
not
prosperous
condition
but
he
had
the
expression
i
detest
and
looked
after
us
with
an
aspect
of
surprise
i
chose
to
consider
a
trifle
impertinent
perhaps
he
envied
trohm
if
so
he
may
have
had
good
reason
for
it
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
up
to
now
i
had
seen
only
a
few
scrub
bushes
at
the
side
of
the
road
with
here
and
there
a
solitary
poplar
to
enliven
the
dead
level
on
either
side
of
us
but
after
we
had
ridden
by
the
fence
which
sets
the
boundary
to
the
good
deacon
land
i
noticed
such
a
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
lane
that
i
could
not
but
exclaim
over
the
natural
as
well
as
cultivated
beauties
which
every
passing
moment
was
bringing
before
me
trohm
could
not
conceal
his
pleasure
these
are
my
lands
said
he
i
have
bestowed
unremitting
attention
upon
them
for
years
it
is
my
hobby
madam
there
is
not
a
tree
you
see
that
has
not
received
my
careful
attention
yonder
orchard
was
set
out
by
me
and
the
fruit
it
yields
madam
i
hope
you
will
remain
long
enough
with
us
to
taste
a
certain
rare
and
luscious
peach
that
i
brought
from
france
a
few
years
ago
it
gives
promise
of
reaching
its
full
perfection
this
year
and
i
shall
be
gratified
indeed
if
you
can
give
it
your
approval
this
was
politeness
indeed
especially
as
i
knew
what
value
men
like
him
set
upon
each
individual
fruit
they
watch
ripen
under
their
care
testifying
my
appreciation
of
his
kindness
i
endeavored
to
introduce
another
and
less
harmless
and
perhaps
less
personally
interesting
topic
of
conversation
the
chimneys
of
his
house
were
beginning
to
show
over
the
trees
and
i
had
heard
nothing
from
this
man
on
the
subject
which
should
have
been
the
most
interesting
of
all
to
me
at
this
moment
and
he
was
the
only
person
in
town
i
was
at
liberty
to
really
confide
in
and
possibly
the
only
man
in
town
who
could
give
me
a
reliable
statement
of
the
reasons
why
the
family
i
was
visiting
was
regarded
in
a
doubtful
light
not
only
by
the
credulous
villagers
but
by
the
new
york
police
i
began
by
an
allusion
to
the
phantom
coach
i
hear
said
i
that
this
lane
has
other
claims
to
attention
beyond
those
afforded
by
the
mysteries
connected
with
it
i
hear
that
it
has
at
times
a
ghostly
visitant
in
the
shape
of
a
spectral
horse
and
carriage
yes
he
replied
with
a
seeming
understanding
that
was
very
flattering
do
not
spare
the
lane
one
of
its
honors
it
has
its
nightly
horror
as
well
as
its
daily
fear
i
wish
the
one
were
as
unreal
as
the
other
you
act
as
if
both
were
unreal
to
you
said
i
the
contrast
between
your
appearance
and
that
of
some
other
members
of
the
lane
is
quite
marked
you
refer
he
seemed
to
hate
to
speak
to
the
misses
knollys
i
presume
i
endeavored
to
treat
the
subject
lightly
to
your
young
enemy
lucetta
i
smilingly
replied
he
had
been
looking
at
me
in
a
perfectly
modest
and
respectful
manner
but
he
dropped
his
eyes
at
this
and
busied
himself
abstractedly
and
yet
i
thought
with
some
intention
in
removing
a
fly
from
the
horse
flank
with
the
tip
of
his
whip
i
will
not
acknowledge
her
as
an
enemy
he
quietly
returned
in
strictly
modulated
tones
i
like
the
girl
too
well
the
fly
had
been
by
this
time
dislodged
but
he
did
not
look
up
and
william
i
suggested
what
do
you
think
of
william
slowly
he
straightened
himself
slowly
he
dropped
the
whip
back
into
its
socket
i
thought
he
was
going
to
answer
when
suddenly
his
whole
attitude
changed
and
he
turned
upon
me
a
beaming
face
full
of
nothing
but
pleasure
the
road
takes
a
turn
here
in
another
moment
you
will
see
my
house
and
even
while
he
spoke
it
burst
upon
us
and
i
instantly
forgot
that
i
had
just
ventured
on
a
somewhat
hazardous
question
it
was
such
a
pretty
place
and
it
was
so
beautifully
and
exquisitely
kept
there
was
a
charm
about
its
porch
that
is
only
to
be
found
in
very
old
places
that
have
been
appreciatively
cared
for
a
high
fence
painted
white
inclosed
a
lawn
like
velvet
and
the
house
itself
shining
with
a
fresh
coat
of
yellow
paint
bore
signs
of
comfort
in
its
windows
not
usually
to
be
found
in
the
solitary
dwelling
of
a
bachelor
i
found
my
eyes
roving
over
each
detail
with
delight
and
almost
blushed
or
rather
had
i
been
twenty
years
younger
might
have
been
thought
to
blush
as
i
met
his
eyes
and
saw
how
much
my
pleasure
gratified
him
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
express
too
much
admiration
for
what
i
see
before
me
i
said
with
what
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
was
a
highly
successful
effort
to
hide
my
confusion
i
have
always
had
a
great
leaning
towards
walks
and
trimly
kept
a
leaning
alas
which
i
have
found
myself
unable
to
gratify
do
not
apologize
he
hastened
to
say
you
but
redouble
my
own
pleasure
in
thus
honoring
my
poor
efforts
with
your
regard
i
have
spared
no
pains
madam
i
have
spared
no
pains
to
render
this
place
beautiful
and
most
of
what
you
see
i
am
proud
to
say
has
been
accomplished
by
my
own
hands
indeed
i
cried
in
some
surprise
letting
my
eye
rest
with
satisfaction
on
the
top
of
a
long
that
was
one
of
the
picturesque
features
of
the
place
it
may
have
been
folly
he
remarked
with
a
gloating
sweep
of
his
eye
over
the
velvet
lawn
and
flowering
shrubs
a
peculiar
look
that
seemed
to
express
something
more
than
the
mere
delight
of
possession
but
i
seemed
to
begrudge
any
hired
assistance
in
the
tending
of
plants
every
one
of
which
seems
to
me
like
a
personal
friend
i
understand
was
my
somewhat
reply
i
really
did
not
quite
know
myself
what
a
contrast
to
the
dismal
grounds
at
the
other
end
of
the
lane
this
was
more
in
my
usual
vein
he
seemed
to
feel
the
difference
for
his
expression
changed
at
my
remark
oh
that
den
he
exclaimed
bitterly
then
seeing
me
look
a
little
shocked
he
added
with
an
admirable
return
to
his
old
manner
i
call
any
place
a
den
where
flowers
do
not
grow
and
jumping
from
the
buggy
he
gathered
an
exquisite
bunch
of
heliotrope
which
he
pressed
upon
me
i
love
sunshine
beds
of
roses
fountains
and
a
sweep
of
lawn
like
this
we
see
before
us
but
do
not
let
me
bore
you
you
have
probably
lingered
long
enough
at
the
old
bachelor
place
and
now
would
like
to
drive
on
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
doubtful
as
it
is
whether
i
shall
soon
again
be
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
offer
you
any
hospitality
i
would
like
to
bring
you
a
glass
of
wine
or
for
i
see
your
eyes
roaming
longingly
toward
my
well
would
you
like
a
draft
of
water
fresh
from
the
bucket
i
assured
him
i
did
not
drink
wine
at
which
i
thought
his
eyes
brightened
but
that
neither
did
i
indulge
in
water
when
in
a
heat
as
at
present
at
which
he
looked
disappointed
and
came
somewhat
reluctantly
back
to
the
buggy
he
brightened
up
however
the
moment
he
was
again
at
my
side
now
for
the
woods
he
exclaimed
with
what
was
undoubtedly
a
forced
laugh
i
thought
the
opportunity
one
i
ought
not
to
slight
do
you
think
said
i
that
it
is
in
those
woods
the
disappearances
occur
of
which
miss
knollys
has
told
me
he
showed
the
same
hesitancy
as
before
to
enter
upon
this
subject
i
think
the
less
you
allow
your
mind
to
dwell
on
this
matter
the
better
said
he
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
remain
long
in
this
lane
i
do
not
expend
any
more
thought
upon
it
than
is
barely
necessary
or
i
should
not
retain
sufficient
courage
to
remain
among
my
roses
and
my
fruits
i
wonder
pardon
me
the
indiscretion
that
you
could
bring
yourself
to
enter
so
a
neighborhood
you
must
be
a
very
brave
woman
i
thought
it
my
duty
i
began
althea
knollys
was
my
friend
and
i
felt
i
owed
a
duty
toward
her
children
besides
should
i
tell
trohm
my
real
errand
in
this
place
gryce
had
intimated
that
he
was
in
the
confidence
of
the
police
and
if
so
his
assistance
in
case
of
necessity
might
be
of
inestimable
value
to
me
yet
if
no
such
necessity
should
arise
would
i
want
this
man
to
know
that
amelia
butterworth
no
i
would
not
take
him
into
my
confidence
not
yet
i
would
only
try
to
get
at
his
idea
of
where
the
blame
lay
that
is
if
he
had
any
besides
he
suggested
in
polite
reminder
after
waiting
a
minute
or
two
for
me
to
continue
did
i
say
besides
was
my
innocent
rejoinder
i
think
i
meant
that
after
seeing
them
my
sense
of
the
importance
of
that
duty
had
increased
william
especially
seems
to
be
a
young
man
of
very
doubtful
amiability
immediately
the
look
returned
to
trohm
face
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
william
said
he
he
not
the
most
agreeable
companion
in
the
world
perhaps
but
he
has
a
pretty
fancy
for
fruit
a
very
pretty
fancy
one
can
hardly
wonder
at
that
in
a
neighbor
of
trohm
said
i
watching
his
look
which
was
fixed
somewhat
gloomily
upon
the
forest
of
trees
now
rapidly
closing
in
around
us
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
madam
the
sight
of
a
blossoming
honeysuckle
hanging
from
an
arbor
such
as
runs
along
my
south
walls
is
a
great
stimulant
to
one
taste
madam
i
not
deny
that
but
william
i
repeated
determined
not
to
let
the
subject
go
have
you
never
thought
he
was
a
little
indifferent
to
his
sisters
a
little
madam
and
a
trifle
rough
to
everything
but
his
dogs
a
trifle
madam
such
reticence
seemed
unnecessary
i
was
almost
angry
but
restrained
myself
and
pursued
quietly
the
girls
on
the
contrary
seem
devoted
to
him
women
have
that
weakness
and
act
as
if
they
would
do
what
would
they
not
do
for
him
miss
butterworth
i
have
never
seen
a
more
amiable
woman
than
yourself
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
his
manner
was
respect
itself
his
smile
genial
and
highly
contagious
i
could
not
help
responding
to
it
in
the
way
he
expected
do
not
talk
to
me
about
this
family
it
is
a
painful
subject
to
me
lucetta
you
know
the
girl
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
prejudice
you
against
her
has
conceived
the
idea
that
i
encourage
william
in
an
intimacy
of
which
she
does
not
approve
she
does
not
want
him
to
talk
to
me
william
has
a
loose
tongue
in
his
head
and
sometimes
drops
unguarded
words
about
their
doings
which
if
any
but
william
spoke
but
there
i
am
forgetting
one
of
the
most
important
rules
of
my
own
life
which
is
to
keep
my
mouth
from
babbling
and
my
tongue
from
guile
influence
of
a
congenial
companion
madam
it
is
irresistible
sometimes
especially
to
a
man
living
so
much
alone
as
myself
i
considered
his
fault
very
pardonable
but
did
not
say
so
lest
i
should
frighten
his
confidences
away
i
thought
there
was
something
wrong
between
you
i
said
lucetta
acted
almost
afraid
of
you
this
morning
i
should
think
she
would
be
glad
of
the
friendship
of
so
good
a
neighbor
his
face
took
on
a
very
sombre
look
she
is
afraid
of
me
he
admitted
afraid
of
what
i
have
seen
or
may
see
of
their
poverty
he
added
with
an
odd
emphasis
i
scarcely
think
he
expected
to
deceive
me
i
did
not
push
the
subject
an
inch
farther
i
saw
it
had
gone
as
far
as
discretion
permitted
at
this
time
we
had
reached
the
heart
of
the
forest
and
were
rapidly
approaching
the
knollys
house
as
the
tops
of
its
great
chimneys
rose
above
the
foliage
i
saw
his
aspect
suddenly
change
i
do
know
why
i
should
so
hate
to
leave
you
here
he
remarked
i
myself
thought
the
prospect
of
the
knollys
mansion
somewhat
uninviting
after
the
pleasant
ride
i
had
had
and
the
glimpse
which
had
been
given
me
of
a
really
cheery
home
and
pleasant
surroundings
this
morning
i
looked
upon
you
as
a
somewhat
daring
woman
the
progress
of
whose
stay
here
would
be
watched
by
me
with
interest
but
after
the
companionship
of
the
last
i
am
conscious
of
an
anxiety
in
your
regard
which
makes
me
doubly
wish
that
miss
knollys
had
not
shut
me
out
from
her
home
are
you
sure
you
wish
to
enter
this
house
again
madam
i
was
surprised
really
surprised
at
the
feeling
he
showed
if
my
heart
had
known
how
to
flutter
it
would
probably
have
fluttered
then
but
happily
the
restraint
of
years
did
not
fail
me
in
this
emergency
taking
advantage
of
the
emotion
which
had
betrayed
him
into
an
acknowledgment
of
his
real
feelings
regarding
the
dangers
lurking
in
this
home
despite
the
check
he
had
endeavored
to
put
upon
his
lips
i
said
with
an
attempt
at
only
to
be
excused
by
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
why
i
thought
you
considered
this
domicile
perfectly
harmless
you
like
the
girls
and
have
no
fault
to
find
with
william
can
it
be
that
this
great
building
has
another
occupant
i
do
not
allude
to
ghosts
neither
of
us
are
likely
to
believe
in
the
supernatural
miss
butterworth
you
have
me
at
a
disadvantage
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
occupant
which
the
house
can
hold
save
the
three
young
people
you
have
mentioned
if
i
seem
to
feel
any
doubt
of
them
but
i
do
feel
any
doubt
i
only
dread
any
place
for
you
which
is
not
watched
over
by
someone
interested
in
your
defence
the
danger
threatening
the
inhabitants
of
this
lane
is
such
a
veiled
one
if
we
knew
where
it
lurked
we
would
no
longer
call
it
danger
sometimes
i
think
the
ghosts
you
allude
to
are
not
as
innocent
as
mere
spectres
usually
are
but
do
let
me
frighten
you
do
how
quick
his
voice
changed
ah
william
i
have
brought
back
your
guest
you
see
i
could
let
her
sit
out
the
noon
hour
in
old
carter
parlor
that
would
be
too
much
for
even
so
amiable
a
person
as
miss
butterworth
to
endure
i
had
hardly
realized
we
were
so
near
the
gate
and
certainly
was
surprised
to
find
william
anywhere
within
hearing
that
his
appearance
at
this
moment
was
anything
but
welcome
must
be
evident
to
every
one
the
sentence
which
it
interrupted
might
have
contained
the
most
important
advice
or
at
the
least
a
warning
i
could
ill
afford
to
lose
but
destiny
was
against
me
and
being
one
who
accepts
the
inevitable
with
good
grace
i
prepared
to
alight
with
trohm
assistance
the
bunch
of
heliotrope
i
held
was
a
little
in
my
way
or
i
should
have
managed
the
jump
with
confidence
and
dignified
agility
as
it
was
i
tripped
slightly
which
brought
out
a
chuckle
from
william
that
at
the
moment
seemed
more
wicked
to
me
than
any
crime
meanwhile
he
had
not
let
matters
proceed
thus
far
without
putting
more
than
one
question
and
where
simsbury
and
why
did
miss
butterworth
think
she
had
got
to
sit
in
carter
parlor
simsbury
said
i
as
soon
as
i
could
recover
from
the
mingled
exertion
and
embarrassment
of
my
descent
to
terra
firma
felt
it
necessary
to
take
the
horse
to
the
shoer
that
is
a
work
as
you
know
and
i
felt
confident
that
he
and
especially
you
would
be
glad
to
have
me
accept
any
means
for
escaping
so
dreary
a
waiting
the
grunt
he
uttered
was
eloquent
of
anything
but
satisfaction
i
go
tell
the
girls
he
said
but
he
did
go
till
he
had
seen
trohm
enter
his
buggy
and
drive
slowly
off
that
all
this
did
not
add
to
my
liking
for
william
goes
without
saying
the
flower
parlor
xv
lucetta
fulfils
my
expectation
of
her
it
was
not
till
trohm
had
driven
away
that
i
noticed
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
a
horse
tied
up
whose
empty
saddle
bespoke
a
visitor
within
at
any
other
gate
and
on
any
other
road
this
would
not
have
struck
me
as
worthy
of
notice
much
less
of
comment
but
here
and
after
all
that
i
had
heard
during
the
morning
the
circumstance
was
so
unexpected
i
could
not
help
showing
my
astonishment
a
visitor
i
asked
some
one
to
see
lucetta
william
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
i
saw
he
was
in
a
state
of
high
excitement
he
had
probably
been
in
this
condition
when
we
drove
up
but
my
attention
being
directed
elsewhere
i
had
not
noticed
it
now
however
it
was
perfectly
plain
to
me
and
it
did
not
seem
quite
the
excitement
of
displeasure
though
hardly
that
of
joy
she
does
expect
you
yet
he
pursued
as
i
turned
sharply
toward
the
house
and
if
you
interrupt
her
d
n
it
if
i
thought
you
would
interrupt
her
i
thought
it
time
to
teach
him
a
lesson
in
manners
knollys
i
interposed
somewhat
severely
i
am
a
lady
why
should
i
interrupt
your
sister
or
give
her
or
you
a
moment
of
pain
i
do
know
he
muttered
you
are
so
very
quick
i
was
afraid
you
might
think
it
necessary
to
join
her
in
the
parlor
she
is
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
herself
miss
butterworth
and
if
she
do
do
it
the
rest
was
lost
in
indistinct
guttural
sounds
i
made
no
effort
to
answer
this
tirade
i
took
my
usual
course
in
quite
my
usual
way
to
the
front
steps
and
proceeded
to
mount
them
without
so
much
as
looking
behind
me
to
see
whether
or
not
this
uncouth
representative
of
the
knollys
name
had
kept
at
my
heels
or
not
entering
the
door
which
was
open
i
came
without
any
effort
on
my
part
upon
lucetta
and
her
visitor
who
proved
to
be
a
young
gentleman
they
were
standing
together
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
were
so
absorbed
in
what
they
were
saying
that
they
neither
saw
nor
heard
me
i
was
therefore
enabled
to
catch
the
following
sentences
which
struck
me
as
of
some
moment
the
first
was
uttered
by
her
and
in
very
pleading
tones
a
week
i
only
ask
a
week
then
perhaps
i
can
give
you
an
answer
which
will
satisfy
you
his
reply
in
manner
if
not
in
matter
proclaimed
him
the
lover
of
whom
i
had
so
lately
heard
i
can
not
dear
girl
indeed
i
can
not
my
whole
future
depends
upon
my
immediately
making
the
move
in
which
i
have
asked
you
to
join
me
if
i
wait
a
week
my
opportunity
will
be
gone
lucetta
you
know
me
and
you
know
how
i
love
you
then
come
a
rude
hand
on
my
shoulder
distracted
my
attention
william
stood
lowering
behind
me
and
as
i
turned
whispered
in
my
ear
you
must
come
round
the
other
way
lucetta
is
so
touchy
the
sight
of
you
will
drive
every
sensible
idea
out
of
her
head
his
blundering
whisper
did
what
my
presence
and
by
no
means
light
footsteps
had
failed
to
do
with
a
start
lucetta
turned
and
meeting
my
eye
drew
back
in
visible
confusion
the
young
man
followed
her
hastily
is
it
lucetta
he
pleaded
with
a
fine
manly
ignoring
of
our
presence
that
roused
my
admiration
she
did
not
answer
her
look
was
enough
william
seeing
it
turned
furious
at
once
and
bounding
by
me
faced
the
young
man
with
an
oath
you
a
fool
to
take
no
from
a
silly
chit
like
that
he
vociferated
if
i
loved
a
girl
as
you
say
you
love
lucetta
i
have
her
if
i
had
to
carry
her
away
by
force
she
stop
screaming
before
she
was
well
out
of
the
lane
i
know
women
while
you
listen
to
them
they
talk
and
talk
but
once
let
a
man
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
a
snap
of
his
fingers
finished
the
sentence
i
thought
the
fellow
brutal
but
scarcely
so
stupid
as
i
had
heretofore
considered
him
his
words
however
might
just
as
well
have
been
uttered
into
empty
air
the
young
man
he
so
violently
addressed
appeared
hardly
to
have
heard
him
and
as
for
lucetta
she
was
so
nearly
insensible
from
misery
that
she
had
sufficient
ado
to
keep
herself
from
falling
at
her
lover
feet
lucetta
lucetta
is
it
then
you
will
not
go
with
me
i
can
not
william
here
knows
that
i
can
not
i
must
wait
till
but
here
her
brother
seized
her
so
violently
by
the
wrist
that
she
stopped
from
sheer
pain
i
fear
however
that
was
she
turned
pale
as
death
under
his
clutch
and
when
he
tried
to
utter
some
hot
passionate
words
into
her
ear
shook
her
head
but
did
not
speak
though
her
lover
was
gazing
with
a
last
final
appeal
into
her
eyes
the
delicate
girl
was
bearing
out
my
estimate
of
her
seeing
her
thus
unresponsive
william
flung
her
hand
from
him
and
turned
upon
me
it
your
fault
he
cried
you
come
in
but
at
this
lucetta
recovering
her
poise
in
a
moment
cried
out
shrilly
for
shame
william
what
has
miss
butterworth
to
do
with
this
you
are
not
helping
me
with
your
roughness
god
knows
i
find
this
hour
hard
enough
without
this
show
of
anxiety
on
your
part
to
be
rid
of
me
there
woman
gratitude
for
you
was
his
snarling
reply
i
offer
to
take
all
the
responsibilities
on
my
own
shoulders
and
make
it
right
with
with
her
sister
and
all
that
and
she
calls
it
desire
to
get
rid
of
her
well
have
your
own
way
he
growled
storming
down
the
hall
i
done
with
it
for
one
the
young
man
whose
attitude
of
reserve
mixed
with
a
strange
and
lingering
tenderness
for
this
girl
whom
he
evidently
loved
without
fully
understanding
her
was
every
minute
winning
more
and
more
of
my
admiration
had
meanwhile
raised
her
trembling
hand
to
his
lips
in
what
was
as
we
all
could
see
a
last
farewell
in
another
moment
he
was
walking
by
us
giving
me
as
he
passed
a
low
bow
that
for
all
its
grace
did
not
succeed
in
hiding
from
me
the
deep
and
heartfelt
disappointment
with
which
he
quitted
this
house
as
his
figure
passed
through
the
door
hiding
for
one
moment
the
sunshine
i
felt
an
oppression
such
as
has
not
often
visited
my
healthy
nature
and
when
it
passed
and
disappeared
something
like
the
good
spirit
of
the
place
seemed
to
go
with
it
leaving
in
its
place
doubt
gloom
and
a
morbid
apprehension
of
that
unknown
something
which
in
lucetta
eyes
had
rendered
his
dismissal
necessary
where
saracen
i
declare
i
nothing
but
a
fool
without
that
dog
shouted
william
if
he
has
to
be
tied
up
another
day
but
shame
was
not
entirely
eliminated
from
his
breast
for
at
lucetta
reproachful
william
he
sheepishly
dropped
his
head
and
strode
out
muttering
some
words
i
was
fain
to
accept
as
an
apology
i
had
expected
to
encounter
a
wreck
in
lucetta
as
this
episode
in
her
life
closed
she
turned
toward
me
but
i
did
not
yet
know
this
girl
whose
frailty
seemed
to
lie
mostly
in
her
physique
though
she
was
suffering
far
more
than
her
defence
of
me
to
her
brother
would
seem
to
denote
there
was
a
spirit
in
her
approach
and
a
steady
look
in
her
dark
eye
which
assured
me
that
i
could
not
calculate
upon
any
loss
in
lucetta
keenness
in
case
we
came
to
an
issue
over
the
mystery
that
was
eating
into
the
happiness
as
well
as
the
honor
of
this
household
i
am
glad
to
see
you
were
her
unexpected
words
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
was
a
lover
of
mine
at
least
he
once
professed
to
care
for
me
very
much
and
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
married
him
but
there
were
reasons
which
i
once
thought
most
excellent
why
this
seemed
anything
but
expedient
and
so
i
sent
him
away
he
came
without
warning
to
ask
me
to
go
away
with
him
after
the
hastiest
of
ceremonies
to
south
america
where
a
splendid
prospect
has
suddenly
opened
for
him
you
see
do
you
that
i
could
not
do
that
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
selfishness
in
me
to
leave
loreen
to
leave
william
who
seems
only
too
anxious
to
be
left
i
put
in
as
her
voice
trailed
off
in
the
first
evidence
of
embarrassment
she
had
shown
since
she
faced
me
william
is
a
difficult
man
to
understand
was
her
firm
but
quiet
retort
from
his
talk
you
would
judge
him
to
be
morose
if
not
positively
unkind
but
in
action
she
did
not
tell
me
how
he
was
in
action
perhaps
her
truthfulness
got
the
better
of
her
or
perhaps
she
saw
it
would
be
hard
work
to
prejudice
me
now
in
his
favor
xvi
loreen
lucetta
had
said
to
her
departing
lover
that
in
a
week
she
might
be
able
were
he
willing
or
in
a
position
to
wait
to
give
him
a
more
satisfactory
answer
why
in
a
week
that
her
hesitation
sprang
from
the
mere
dislike
of
leaving
her
sister
so
suddenly
or
that
she
had
sacrificed
her
life
happiness
to
any
childish
idea
of
decorum
i
did
not
think
probable
the
spirit
she
had
shown
her
immovable
attitude
under
a
temptation
which
had
not
only
romance
to
recommend
it
but
everything
else
which
could
affect
a
young
and
sensitive
woman
argued
in
my
mind
the
existence
of
some
uncompleted
duty
of
so
exacting
and
imperative
a
nature
that
she
could
not
even
consider
the
greatest
interests
of
her
own
life
until
this
one
thing
was
out
of
her
way
william
rude
question
of
the
morning
what
shall
we
do
with
the
old
girl
till
it
is
all
over
recurred
to
me
in
support
of
this
theory
making
me
feel
that
i
needed
no
further
confirmation
to
be
quite
certain
that
a
crisis
was
approaching
in
this
house
which
would
tax
my
powers
to
the
utmost
and
call
perhaps
for
the
use
of
the
whistle
which
i
had
received
from
gryce
and
which
following
his
instructions
i
had
tied
carefully
about
my
neck
yet
how
could
i
associate
lucetta
with
crime
or
dream
of
the
police
in
connection
with
the
serene
loreen
whose
every
look
was
a
rebuke
to
all
that
was
false
vile
or
even
common
easily
my
readers
easily
with
that
great
hulking
william
in
my
remembrance
to
shield
to
hide
perhaps
his
deformity
of
soul
from
the
world
even
such
gentle
and
gracious
women
as
these
have
been
known
to
enter
into
acts
which
to
an
unprejudiced
eye
and
an
unbiased
conscience
would
seem
little
short
of
fiendish
love
for
an
unworthy
relative
or
rather
the
sense
of
duty
toward
those
of
own
blood
has
driven
many
a
woman
to
her
ruin
as
may
be
seen
any
day
in
the
police
annals
i
am
quite
aware
that
i
have
not
as
yet
put
into
definite
words
the
suspicion
upon
which
i
was
now
prepared
to
work
up
to
this
time
it
had
been
too
vague
or
rather
of
too
monstrous
a
character
for
me
not
to
consider
other
theories
such
as
for
instance
the
possible
connection
of
old
mother
jane
with
the
unaccountable
disappearances
which
had
taken
place
in
this
lane
but
after
this
scene
the
increased
assurance
i
was
hourly
receiving
that
something
extraordinary
and
out
of
keeping
with
the
customary
appearances
of
the
household
was
secretly
going
on
in
some
one
of
the
various
chambers
of
that
long
corridor
i
had
been
prevented
from
entering
forced
me
to
accept
and
act
upon
the
belief
that
these
young
women
held
in
charge
a
prisoner
of
some
kind
of
whose
presence
in
the
house
they
dreaded
the
discovery
now
who
could
this
prisoner
be
common
sense
supplied
me
with
but
one
answer
silly
rufus
the
boy
who
within
a
few
days
had
vanished
from
among
the
good
people
of
this
seemingly
guileless
community
this
theory
once
established
in
my
mind
i
applied
myself
to
a
consideration
of
the
means
at
my
disposal
for
determining
its
validity
the
simplest
surest
but
least
satisfactory
to
one
of
my
nature
was
to
summon
the
police
and
have
the
house
thoroughly
searched
but
this
involved
in
case
i
had
been
deceived
by
appearances
as
was
possible
even
to
a
woman
of
my
experience
and
discrimination
a
scandal
and
an
opprobrium
which
i
would
be
the
last
to
inflict
upon
althea
children
unless
justice
to
the
rest
of
the
world
demanded
it
it
was
in
consideration
of
this
very
fact
perhaps
that
i
had
been
chosen
for
this
duty
instead
of
some
regular
police
spy
gryce
as
i
very
well
knew
has
made
it
his
rule
of
life
never
to
risk
the
reputation
of
any
man
or
woman
without
reasons
so
excellent
as
to
carry
their
own
exoneration
with
them
and
should
i
a
woman
with
full
as
much
heart
as
himself
if
not
quite
as
much
brain
at
least
in
the
estimation
of
people
in
general
by
any
premature
exposure
of
my
suspicions
subject
these
young
friends
of
mine
to
humiliations
they
are
far
too
weak
and
too
poor
to
rise
above
no
rather
would
i
trust
a
little
longer
to
my
own
perspicacity
and
make
sure
by
the
use
of
my
own
eyes
that
the
situation
called
for
the
interference
i
had
as
you
may
say
at
the
end
of
the
cord
i
wore
about
my
neck
lucetta
had
not
asked
me
how
i
came
to
be
back
so
much
sooner
than
she
had
reason
to
expect
me
the
arrival
of
her
lover
had
probably
put
all
idea
of
her
former
plans
out
of
her
head
i
therefore
gave
her
the
shortest
of
explanations
when
we
met
at
the
dinner
table
nothing
further
seemed
to
be
necessary
for
the
girls
were
even
more
abstracted
than
before
and
william
positively
boorish
till
a
warning
glance
from
loreen
recalled
him
to
his
better
self
which
meant
silence
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
the
evening
before
neither
sister
remained
an
instant
with
me
after
the
other
entered
my
company
and
though
the
alternations
were
less
frequent
than
at
that
time
their
peculiarities
were
more
marked
and
less
naturally
accounted
for
it
was
while
loreen
was
with
me
that
i
made
the
suggestion
which
had
been
hovering
on
my
lips
ever
since
the
noon
i
consider
this
i
observed
in
one
of
the
pauses
of
our
more
than
fitful
conversation
one
of
the
most
interesting
houses
it
has
ever
been
my
good
fortune
to
enter
would
you
mind
my
roaming
about
a
bit
just
to
enjoy
the
flavor
of
its
great
empty
rooms
i
know
they
are
mostly
closed
and
possibly
unfurnished
but
to
a
connoisseur
like
myself
in
colonial
architecture
this
rather
adds
to
than
detracts
from
their
interest
impossible
she
was
going
to
say
but
caught
herself
back
in
time
and
changed
the
imperative
word
to
one
more
conciliatory
if
equally
unyielding
i
am
sorry
miss
butterworth
to
deny
you
this
gratification
but
the
condition
of
the
rooms
and
the
unhappy
excitement
into
which
we
have
been
thrown
by
the
unfortunate
visit
paid
to
lucetta
by
a
gentleman
to
whom
she
is
only
too
much
attached
make
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
consider
any
such
undertaking
i
may
find
it
easier
but
if
not
be
assured
you
shall
see
every
nook
and
corner
of
this
house
before
you
finally
leave
it
thank
you
i
will
remember
that
to
one
of
my
tastes
an
ancient
room
in
a
mansion
like
this
affords
a
delight
not
to
be
understood
by
one
who
knows
less
of
the
last
century
life
the
legends
connected
with
your
great
below
we
were
sitting
in
my
room
i
having
refused
to
be
cooped
up
in
their
dreary
side
parlor
and
she
not
having
offered
me
any
other
spot
more
cheerful
are
sufficient
in
themselves
to
hold
me
entranced
for
an
hour
i
heard
one
of
them
which
she
spoke
more
quickly
than
usual
and
for
her
quite
sharply
that
of
lucetta
namesake
i
explained
she
who
rode
through
the
night
after
a
daughter
who
had
won
her
lover
heart
away
from
her
ah
it
is
a
tale
but
i
think
carter
might
have
left
its
relation
to
us
did
she
tell
you
anything
else
no
other
tradition
of
this
place
i
assured
her
i
am
glad
she
was
so
considerate
but
why
if
you
will
pardon
me
did
she
happen
to
light
upon
that
story
we
have
not
heard
those
incidents
spoken
of
for
years
not
since
the
phantom
coach
flew
through
this
road
the
last
time
i
ventured
with
a
smile
that
should
have
disarmed
her
from
suspecting
any
ulterior
motive
on
my
part
in
thus
introducing
a
subject
which
could
not
be
altogether
pleasing
to
her
the
phantom
coach
have
you
heard
of
that
i
wish
it
had
been
lucetta
who
had
said
this
and
to
whom
my
reply
was
due
the
opportunities
would
have
been
much
greater
for
an
injudicious
display
of
feeling
on
her
part
and
for
a
suitable
conclusion
on
mine
but
it
was
loreen
and
she
never
forgot
herself
so
i
had
to
content
myself
with
the
persuasion
that
her
voice
was
just
a
whit
less
clear
than
usual
and
her
serenity
enough
impaired
for
her
to
look
out
of
my
one
high
and
dismal
window
instead
of
into
my
face
my
dear
i
had
not
called
her
this
before
though
the
term
had
frequently
risen
to
my
lips
in
answer
to
lucetta
you
should
have
gone
with
me
into
the
village
then
you
would
not
need
to
ask
if
i
had
heard
of
the
phantom
coach
the
probe
had
reached
the
quick
at
last
she
looked
quite
startled
you
amaze
me
she
said
what
do
you
mean
miss
butterworth
why
should
i
not
have
needed
to
ask
because
you
would
have
heard
it
whispered
about
in
every
lane
and
corner
it
is
common
talk
in
town
you
must
know
why
miss
knollys
she
was
not
looking
out
of
the
window
now
she
was
looking
at
me
i
assure
you
she
murmured
i
do
not
know
at
all
nothing
could
be
more
incomprehensible
to
me
explain
yourself
i
entreat
you
the
phantom
coach
is
but
a
myth
to
me
interesting
only
as
involving
certain
ancestors
of
mine
of
course
i
assented
no
one
of
real
sense
could
regard
it
in
any
other
light
but
villagers
will
talk
and
they
say
you
will
soon
know
what
if
i
do
not
tell
you
myself
that
it
passed
through
the
lane
on
tuesday
night
tuesday
night
her
composure
had
been
regained
but
not
so
entirely
but
that
her
voice
slightly
trembled
that
was
before
you
came
i
hope
it
was
not
an
omen
i
was
in
no
mood
for
pleasantry
they
say
that
the
passing
of
this
apparition
denotes
misfortune
to
those
who
see
it
i
am
therefore
obviously
exempt
but
you
did
you
see
it
i
am
just
curious
to
know
if
it
is
visible
to
those
who
live
in
the
lane
it
ought
to
have
turned
in
here
were
you
fortunate
enough
to
have
been
awake
at
that
moment
and
to
have
seen
this
spectral
appearance
she
shuddered
i
was
not
mistaken
in
believing
i
saw
this
sign
of
emotion
for
i
was
watching
her
very
closely
and
the
movement
was
unmistakable
i
have
never
seen
anything
ghostly
in
my
life
said
she
i
am
not
at
all
superstitious
if
i
had
been
or
if
i
had
thought
it
wise
to
press
her
too
closely
i
might
have
inquired
why
she
looked
so
pale
and
trembled
so
visibly
but
my
natural
kindness
together
with
an
instinct
of
caution
restrained
me
and
i
only
remarked
there
you
are
sensible
miss
knollys
doubly
so
as
a
denizen
of
this
house
which
carter
was
obliging
enough
to
suggest
to
me
is
considered
by
many
as
haunted
the
straightening
of
miss
knollys
lips
augured
no
good
to
carter
now
i
only
wish
it
was
i
laughed
dryly
i
should
really
like
to
meet
a
ghost
say
in
your
great
which
i
am
forbidden
to
enter
you
are
not
forbidden
she
hastily
returned
you
may
explore
it
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
from
accompanying
you
but
you
will
meet
no
ghosts
the
hour
is
not
propitious
taken
aback
by
her
sudden
amenity
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
would
it
be
worth
while
for
me
to
search
a
room
she
was
willing
to
have
me
enter
no
and
yet
any
knowledge
which
could
be
obtained
in
regard
to
this
house
might
be
of
use
to
me
or
to
gryce
i
decided
to
embrace
her
offer
after
first
testing
her
with
one
other
question
would
you
prefer
to
have
me
steal
down
these
corridors
at
night
and
dare
their
dusky
recesses
at
a
time
when
spectres
are
supposed
to
walk
the
halls
they
once
flitted
through
in
happy
consciousness
hardly
she
made
the
greatest
effort
to
sustain
the
jest
but
her
concern
and
dread
were
manifest
i
think
i
had
better
give
you
the
keys
now
than
subject
you
to
the
drafts
and
chilling
discomforts
of
this
old
place
at
midnight
i
rose
with
a
semblance
of
eager
anticipation
i
will
take
you
at
your
word
said
i
the
keys
my
dear
i
am
going
to
visit
a
haunted
room
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
do
not
think
she
was
deceived
by
this
feigned
ebullition
perhaps
it
was
too
much
out
of
keeping
with
my
ordinary
manner
but
she
gave
no
sign
of
surprise
and
rose
in
her
turn
with
an
air
suggestive
of
relief
excuse
me
if
i
precede
you
she
begged
i
will
meet
you
at
the
head
of
the
corridor
with
the
keys
i
was
in
hopes
she
would
be
long
enough
in
obtaining
them
to
allow
me
to
stroll
along
the
front
hall
to
the
opening
into
the
corridor
i
was
so
anxious
to
enter
but
the
spryness
i
showed
seemed
to
have
a
corresponding
effect
upon
her
for
she
almost
flew
down
the
passageway
before
me
and
was
back
at
my
side
before
i
could
take
a
step
in
the
coveted
direction
these
will
take
you
into
any
room
on
the
first
floor
said
she
you
will
meet
with
dust
and
lucetta
abhorrence
spiders
but
for
these
i
shall
make
no
apologies
girls
who
can
not
provide
comforts
for
the
few
rooms
they
utilize
can
not
be
expected
to
keep
in
order
the
large
and
disused
apartments
of
a
former
generation
i
hate
dirt
and
despise
spiders
was
my
dry
retort
but
i
am
willing
to
brave
both
for
the
pleasure
of
satisfying
my
love
for
the
antique
at
which
she
handed
me
the
keys
with
a
calm
smile
which
was
not
without
its
element
of
sadness
i
will
be
here
on
your
return
she
said
leaning
over
the
banisters
to
speak
to
me
as
i
took
my
first
steps
down
i
shall
want
to
hear
whether
you
are
repaid
for
your
trouble
i
thanked
her
and
proceeded
on
my
way
somewhat
doubtful
whether
by
so
doing
i
was
making
the
best
possible
use
of
my
opportunities
xvii
the
flower
parlor
the
lower
hall
did
not
correspond
exactly
with
the
one
above
it
was
larger
and
through
its
connection
with
the
front
door
presented
the
shape
of
a
letter
t
that
is
to
the
superficial
observer
who
was
not
acquainted
with
the
size
of
the
house
and
had
not
had
the
opportunity
of
remarking
that
at
the
extremities
of
the
upper
hall
making
this
t
were
two
imposing
doors
usually
found
shut
except
at
when
the
one
was
thrown
open
disclosing
a
long
and
dismal
corridor
similar
to
the
ones
above
down
this
corridor
was
the
into
which
i
had
now
been
taken
three
times
the
one
i
had
no
doubt
led
the
way
into
the
great
or
which
i
had
started
out
to
see
proceeding
first
to
the
front
of
the
house
where
some
glimmer
of
light
penetrated
from
the
open
door
i
looked
the
keys
over
and
read
what
was
written
on
the
several
tags
attached
to
them
they
were
seven
in
number
and
bore
some
such
names
as
these
blue
chamber
library
flower
parlor
shell
cabinet
dark
parlor
all
of
which
was
very
suggestive
and
to
an
antiquarian
like
myself
most
alluring
but
it
was
upon
a
key
marked
a
i
first
fixed
my
attention
this
i
had
been
told
would
open
the
large
door
at
the
extremity
of
the
upper
hall
and
when
i
made
a
trial
with
it
i
found
it
to
move
easily
though
somewhat
gratingly
in
the
lock
releasing
the
great
doors
which
in
another
moment
swung
inward
with
a
growling
sound
which
might
have
been
startling
to
a
nervous
person
filled
with
the
legends
of
the
place
but
in
me
the
only
emotion
awakened
was
one
of
disgust
at
the
nauseous
character
of
the
air
which
instantly
enveloped
me
had
i
wished
for
any
further
proof
than
was
afforded
by
the
warning
given
me
by
the
condition
of
the
hinges
that
the
foot
of
man
had
not
lately
invaded
these
precincts
i
would
have
had
it
in
the
mouldy
atmosphere
and
smell
of
dust
that
greeted
me
on
the
threshold
neither
human
breath
nor
a
ray
of
outdoor
sunshine
seemed
to
have
disturbed
its
gloomy
quiet
for
years
and
when
i
moved
as
i
presently
did
to
open
one
of
the
windows
i
dimly
discerned
at
my
right
i
felt
such
a
movement
of
something
foul
and
noisome
amid
the
decaying
rags
of
the
carpet
through
which
i
was
stumbling
that
i
had
to
call
into
use
the
stronger
elements
of
my
character
not
to
back
out
of
a
place
so
given
over
to
rot
and
the
creatures
that
infest
it
what
a
spot
thought
i
for
amelia
butterworth
to
find
herself
in
and
wondered
if
i
could
ever
wear
again
the
silk
dress
in
which
i
was
then
enveloped
of
my
shoes
i
took
no
account
they
were
ruined
of
course
i
reached
the
window
in
safety
but
could
not
open
it
neither
could
i
move
the
adjoining
one
there
were
sixteen
in
all
or
so
i
afterwards
found
and
not
till
i
reached
the
last
you
see
i
am
very
persistent
did
i
succeed
in
loosening
the
bar
that
held
its
inner
shutter
in
place
this
done
i
was
able
to
lift
the
window
and
for
the
first
time
in
years
perhaps
let
in
a
ray
of
light
into
this
desolated
apartment
the
result
was
disappointing
mouldy
walls
hangings
two
very
ancient
and
quaint
fireplaces
met
my
eyes
and
nothing
more
the
room
was
absolutely
empty
for
a
few
minutes
i
allowed
my
eyes
to
roam
over
the
great
rectangular
space
in
which
so
much
that
was
curious
and
interesting
had
once
taken
place
and
then
with
a
vague
sense
of
defeat
turned
my
eyes
outward
anxious
to
see
what
view
could
be
obtained
from
the
window
i
had
opened
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
before
me
a
high
wall
with
here
and
there
a
window
in
it
all
tightly
barred
and
closed
till
by
a
careful
inspection
about
me
i
realized
that
i
was
looking
upon
the
other
wing
of
the
building
and
that
between
these
wings
extended
a
court
so
narrow
and
long
that
it
gave
to
the
building
the
shape
as
i
have
before
said
of
the
letter
u
a
dreary
prospect
reminding
one
of
the
view
from
a
prison
but
it
had
its
point
of
interest
for
in
the
court
below
me
the
brick
pavement
of
which
was
half
obliterated
by
grass
i
caught
sight
of
william
in
an
attitude
so
different
from
any
i
had
hitherto
seen
him
assume
that
i
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
it
till
i
caught
sight
of
the
jaws
of
a
dog
protruding
from
under
his
arms
and
then
i
realized
he
was
hugging
saracen
the
dog
was
tied
but
the
comfort
which
william
seemed
to
take
in
just
this
physical
contact
with
his
rough
skin
was
something
worth
seeing
it
made
me
quite
thoughtful
for
a
moment
i
detest
dogs
and
it
gives
me
a
creepy
sensation
to
see
them
fondled
but
sincerity
of
feeling
appeals
to
me
and
no
one
could
watch
william
knollys
with
his
dogs
without
seeing
that
he
really
loved
the
brutes
thus
in
one
day
i
had
witnessed
the
best
and
worst
side
of
this
man
but
wait
had
i
seen
the
worst
i
was
not
so
sure
that
i
had
he
had
not
noticed
my
peering
for
which
i
was
duly
thankful
and
after
another
fruitless
survey
of
the
windows
in
the
wall
before
me
i
drew
back
and
prepared
to
leave
the
place
this
was
by
no
means
a
pleasant
undertaking
i
could
now
see
what
i
had
only
felt
before
and
to
traverse
the
space
before
me
amid
beetles
and
spiders
required
a
determination
of
no
ordinary
nature
i
was
glad
when
i
reached
the
great
doors
and
more
than
glad
when
they
closed
behind
me
so
much
for
room
a
thought
i
the
next
most
promising
apartment
was
in
the
same
corridor
as
the
it
was
called
the
dark
parlor
entering
it
i
found
it
dark
indeed
but
not
because
of
lack
of
light
but
because
its
hangings
were
all
of
a
dismal
red
and
its
furniture
of
the
blackest
ebony
as
this
mainly
consisted
of
shelves
and
cabinets
placed
against
three
of
its
four
walls
the
effect
was
gloomy
indeed
and
fully
accounted
for
the
name
which
the
room
had
received
i
lingered
in
it
however
longer
than
i
had
in
the
big
chiefly
because
the
shelves
contained
books
had
anything
better
offered
i
might
not
have
continued
my
explorations
but
not
seeing
exactly
how
i
could
pass
away
the
time
more
profitably
i
chose
out
another
key
and
began
to
search
for
the
flower
parlor
i
found
it
beyond
the
in
the
same
hall
as
the
dark
parlor
it
was
as
i
might
have
expected
from
the
name
the
brightest
and
most
cheerful
spot
i
had
yet
found
in
the
whole
house
the
air
in
it
was
even
good
as
if
sunshine
and
breeze
had
not
been
altogether
shut
out
of
it
yet
i
had
no
sooner
taken
one
look
at
its
walls
and
pretty
furniture
than
i
felt
an
oppression
difficult
to
account
for
something
was
wrong
about
this
room
i
am
not
superstitious
and
have
no
faith
in
premonitions
but
once
seized
by
a
conviction
i
have
never
known
myself
to
be
mistaken
as
to
its
import
something
was
wrong
about
this
room
what
it
was
my
business
to
discover
letting
in
more
light
i
took
a
closer
survey
of
the
objects
i
had
hitherto
seen
but
dimly
they
were
many
and
somewhat
contradictory
in
character
the
floor
was
bare
the
first
bare
floor
i
had
come
upon
but
the
shades
in
the
windows
the
lounges
drawn
up
beside
tables
bestrewn
with
books
and
other
objects
of
comfort
and
luxury
bespoke
a
place
in
common
if
not
use
a
faint
smell
of
tobacco
assured
me
in
whose
use
and
from
the
minute
i
recognized
that
this
was
william
sanctum
my
curiosity
grew
unbounded
and
i
neglected
nothing
which
would
be
likely
to
attract
the
detective
in
gryce
force
there
were
several
things
to
be
noted
there
first
that
this
lumbering
lout
of
a
man
read
but
only
on
one
topic
vivisection
secondly
that
he
was
not
a
reader
merely
for
there
were
instruments
in
the
cases
heaped
up
on
the
tables
about
me
and
in
one
corner
it
made
me
a
little
sick
but
i
persevered
in
searching
out
the
corners
a
glass
case
with
certain
horrors
in
it
which
i
took
care
to
note
but
which
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
describe
another
corner
was
blocked
up
by
a
closet
which
stood
out
in
the
room
in
a
way
to
convince
me
it
had
been
built
in
after
the
room
was
otherwise
finished
as
i
crossed
over
to
examine
the
door
which
did
not
appear
to
me
to
be
quite
closed
i
noticed
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
a
huge
discoloration
this
was
the
worst
thing
i
had
yet
encountered
and
while
i
did
not
feel
quite
justified
in
giving
it
a
name
i
could
not
but
feel
some
regret
for
the
rags
of
the
which
after
all
are
more
comfortable
underfoot
than
bare
boards
with
such
suggestive
marks
upon
them
as
these
the
door
to
the
closet
was
as
i
had
expected
slightly
ajar
a
fact
for
which
i
was
profoundly
grateful
for
set
it
down
to
breeding
or
a
natural
recognition
of
other
people
rights
i
would
have
found
it
most
difficult
to
turn
the
knob
of
a
closet
door
inspection
of
which
had
not
been
offered
me
but
finding
it
open
i
gave
it
just
a
little
pull
and
found
well
it
was
a
surprise
much
more
so
than
the
sight
of
a
skeleton
would
have
been
that
the
whole
interior
was
taken
up
by
a
small
circular
staircase
such
as
you
find
in
public
libraries
where
the
books
are
piled
up
in
tiers
it
stretched
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
and
dark
as
it
was
i
thought
i
detected
the
outlines
of
a
by
means
of
which
communication
was
established
with
the
room
above
anxious
to
be
convinced
of
this
i
consulted
with
myself
as
to
what
a
detective
would
do
in
my
place
the
answer
came
readily
enough
mount
the
stairs
and
feel
for
yourself
whether
there
is
a
lock
there
but
my
delicacy
or
shall
i
acknowledge
it
for
once
an
instinct
of
timidity
seemed
to
restrain
me
till
a
remembrance
of
gryce
sarcastic
look
which
i
had
seen
honoring
lesser
occasions
than
these
came
to
nerve
me
and
i
put
foot
on
the
stairs
which
had
last
been
trod
by
whom
shall
i
say
william
let
us
hope
by
william
and
william
only
being
tall
i
had
to
mount
but
a
few
steps
before
reaching
the
ceiling
pausing
for
breath
the
air
being
close
and
the
stairs
steep
i
reached
up
and
felt
for
the
hinge
or
clasp
i
had
every
reason
to
expect
to
encounter
i
found
it
almost
immediately
and
satisfied
now
that
nothing
but
a
board
separated
me
from
the
room
above
i
tried
that
board
with
my
finger
and
was
astonished
to
feel
it
yield
as
this
was
a
wholly
unexpected
discovery
i
drew
back
and
asked
myself
if
it
would
be
wise
to
pursue
it
to
the
point
of
raising
this
door
and
had
hardly
settled
the
question
in
my
own
mind
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
raised
in
a
soothing
murmur
revealed
the
fact
that
the
room
above
was
not
empty
and
that
i
would
be
committing
a
grave
indiscretion
in
thus
tampering
with
a
means
of
entrance
possibly
under
the
very
eye
of
the
person
speaking
if
the
voice
i
had
heard
had
been
all
that
had
come
to
my
ears
i
might
have
ventured
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
to
brave
the
displeasure
of
miss
knollys
by
an
attempt
which
would
have
at
once
satisfied
me
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
suspicions
which
were
congealing
my
blood
as
i
stood
there
but
another
voice
the
heavy
and
threatening
voice
of
william
had
broken
into
this
murmur
and
i
knew
that
if
i
so
much
as
awakened
in
him
the
least
suspicion
of
my
whereabouts
i
would
have
to
dread
an
anger
that
might
not
know
where
to
stop
i
therefore
rested
from
further
efforts
in
this
direction
and
fearing
he
might
bethink
him
of
some
errand
which
would
bring
him
to
the
himself
i
began
a
retreat
which
i
made
slow
only
from
my
desire
not
to
make
any
noise
i
succeeded
as
well
as
if
my
feet
had
been
shod
in
velvet
and
my
dress
had
been
made
of
wool
instead
of
a
rustling
silk
and
when
once
again
i
found
myself
planted
in
the
centre
of
the
flower
parlor
the
closet
door
closed
and
no
evidence
remaining
of
my
late
attempt
to
probe
this
family
secret
i
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
that
was
but
a
symbol
of
my
devout
thankfulness
i
did
not
mean
to
remain
much
longer
in
this
spot
of
evil
suggestions
but
spying
the
corner
of
a
book
protruding
from
under
a
cushion
of
one
of
the
lounges
i
had
a
curiosity
to
see
if
it
were
similar
to
the
others
i
had
handled
drawing
it
out
i
took
one
look
at
it
i
need
not
tell
what
it
was
but
after
a
hasty
glance
here
and
there
through
its
pages
i
put
it
back
shuddering
if
any
doubt
remained
in
my
breast
that
william
was
one
of
those
monsters
who
feed
their
morbid
cravings
by
experiments
upon
the
weak
and
defenceless
it
had
been
dispelled
by
what
i
had
just
seen
in
this
book
however
i
did
not
leave
the
room
immediately
as
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
that
i
should
be
able
to
locate
in
which
of
the
many
apartments
on
the
floor
above
the
supposed
prisoner
was
lodged
i
cast
about
me
for
the
means
of
doing
this
through
the
location
of
the
room
in
which
i
then
was
as
this
could
only
be
done
by
affixing
some
token
to
the
window
which
could
be
recognized
from
without
i
thought
first
of
thrusting
the
end
of
my
handkerchief
through
one
of
the
slats
of
the
outside
blinds
secondly
of
simply
leaving
one
of
these
blinds
ajar
and
finally
of
chipping
off
a
piece
with
the
penknife
i
always
carry
with
innumerable
other
small
things
in
the
bag
i
invariably
wear
at
my
side
fashion
i
hold
counts
for
nothing
against
convenience
this
last
seemed
by
much
the
best
device
a
handkerchief
could
be
discovered
and
pulled
out
an
open
blind
could
be
shut
but
a
sliver
once
separated
from
the
wood
of
the
casement
nothing
could
replace
it
or
even
cover
it
up
without
itself
attracting
attention
taking
out
my
knife
i
glanced
at
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
found
it
still
shut
and
everything
quiet
behind
it
then
i
took
a
look
into
the
shrubs
and
bushes
of
the
yard
outside
and
observing
nothing
to
disturb
me
snipped
off
a
bit
from
one
of
the
outer
edges
of
the
slats
and
then
carefully
reclosed
the
blinds
and
the
window
i
was
crossing
the
threshold
when
i
heard
a
rapid
footstep
in
the
hall
miss
knollys
was
hastening
down
the
hall
to
my
side
oh
miss
butterworth
she
exclaimed
with
one
quick
look
into
the
room
i
was
leaving
this
is
william
den
the
one
spot
he
never
allows
any
of
us
to
enter
i
do
know
how
the
key
came
to
be
upon
the
string
it
never
was
before
and
i
am
afraid
he
never
will
forgive
me
he
need
never
know
that
i
have
been
the
victim
of
such
a
mistake
said
i
my
feet
leave
no
trail
and
as
i
use
no
perfumes
he
will
never
suspect
that
i
have
enjoyed
a
glimpse
of
these
walls
and
ancient
cabinets
the
slats
of
the
blinds
are
a
little
open
she
remarked
her
eyes
searching
my
face
for
some
sign
that
i
am
sure
she
did
not
find
there
were
they
so
when
you
came
in
i
hardly
think
so
it
was
very
dark
shall
i
put
them
as
i
found
them
no
he
will
not
notice
and
she
hurried
me
out
still
eying
me
breathlessly
as
if
she
half
distrusted
my
composure
come
amelia
i
now
whispered
in
the
time
for
exertion
has
come
show
this
young
woman
who
is
not
much
behind
you
in
some
of
the
lighter
phases
of
your
character
charm
her
amelia
charm
her
or
you
may
live
to
rue
this
invasion
into
family
secrets
more
than
you
may
like
to
acknowledge
at
the
present
moment
a
task
of
some
difficulty
but
i
rejoice
in
difficult
tasks
and
before
another
had
passed
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
miss
knollys
entirely
restored
to
that
state
of
placid
melancholy
which
was
the
natural
expression
of
her
calm
but
unhappy
nature
we
visited
the
shell
cabinet
the
blue
parlor
and
another
room
the
peculiarities
of
which
i
have
forgotten
frightened
by
the
result
of
leaving
me
to
my
own
devices
she
did
not
quit
me
for
an
instant
and
when
my
curiosity
quite
satisfied
i
hinted
that
a
short
nap
in
my
own
room
would
rest
me
for
the
evening
she
proceeded
with
me
to
the
door
of
my
apartment
the
locksmith
whom
i
saw
this
morning
has
not
kept
his
word
i
remarked
as
she
was
turning
away
none
of
the
tradesmen
here
do
that
was
her
cold
answer
i
have
given
up
expecting
having
any
attention
paid
to
my
wants
humph
thought
i
another
pleasant
admission
amelia
butterworth
this
has
not
been
a
cheerful
day
xviii
the
second
night
i
can
not
say
that
i
looked
forward
to
the
night
with
any
very
cheerful
anticipations
the
locksmith
having
failed
to
keep
his
appointment
i
was
likely
to
have
no
more
protection
against
intrusion
than
i
had
had
the
night
before
and
while
i
can
not
say
that
i
especially
feared
any
unwelcome
entrance
into
my
apartment
i
should
have
gone
to
my
rest
with
a
greater
sense
of
satisfaction
if
a
key
had
been
in
the
lock
and
that
key
had
been
turned
by
my
own
hand
on
my
own
side
of
the
door
the
atmosphere
of
gloom
which
settled
down
over
the
household
after
the
evening
meal
seemed
like
the
warning
note
of
something
strange
and
evil
awaiting
us
so
marked
was
this
that
many
in
my
situation
would
have
further
disturbed
these
girls
by
some
allusion
to
the
fact
but
that
was
not
the
rôle
i
had
set
myself
to
play
at
this
crisis
i
remembered
what
gryce
had
said
about
winning
their
confidence
and
though
the
turmoil
evident
in
lucetta
mind
and
the
distraction
visible
even
in
the
careful
miss
knollys
led
me
to
expect
a
culmination
of
some
kind
before
the
night
was
over
i
not
only
hid
my
recognition
of
this
fact
but
succeeded
in
sufficiently
impressing
them
with
the
contentment
which
my
own
petty
employments
afforded
me
i
am
never
idle
even
in
other
persons
houses
for
them
to
spare
me
the
harassment
of
their
alternate
visits
which
in
their
present
mood
and
mine
promised
little
in
the
way
of
increased
knowledge
of
their
purposes
and
much
in
the
way
of
distraction
and
the
loss
of
that
nerve
upon
which
i
calculated
for
a
successful
issue
out
of
the
possible
difficulties
of
this
night
had
i
been
a
woman
of
ordinary
courage
i
would
have
sounded
three
premonitory
notes
upon
my
whistle
before
blowing
out
my
candle
but
while
i
am
not
lacking
i
hope
in
many
of
the
finer
feminine
qualities
which
link
me
to
my
sex
i
have
but
few
of
that
sex
weaknesses
and
none
of
its
instinctive
reliance
upon
others
which
leads
it
so
often
to
neglect
its
own
resources
till
i
saw
good
reasons
for
summoning
the
police
i
proposed
to
preserve
a
discreet
silence
a
premature
alarm
being
in
their
eyes
as
i
knew
from
many
talks
with
gryce
the
one
thing
suggestive
of
a
timid
and
inexperienced
mind
hannah
had
brought
me
a
delicious
cup
of
tea
at
ten
the
influence
of
which
was
to
make
me
very
drowsy
at
eleven
but
i
shook
this
weakness
off
and
began
my
night
watch
in
a
state
of
stern
composure
which
i
verily
believe
would
have
awakened
gryce
admiration
had
it
been
consonant
with
the
proprieties
for
him
to
have
seen
it
indeed
the
very
seriousness
of
the
occasion
was
such
that
i
could
not
have
trembled
if
i
would
every
nerve
and
faculty
being
strained
to
their
utmost
to
make
the
most
of
every
sound
which
might
arise
in
the
now
silent
and
discreetly
darkened
house
i
had
purposely
omitted
the
precaution
of
pushing
my
bed
against
the
door
of
my
room
as
i
had
done
the
night
before
being
anxious
to
find
myself
in
a
position
to
cross
its
threshold
at
the
least
alarm
that
this
would
come
i
felt
positive
for
hannah
in
leaving
my
room
had
taken
pains
to
say
in
unconscious
imitation
of
what
miss
knollys
had
remarked
the
night
before
do
let
any
queer
sounds
you
may
hear
disturb
you
miss
butterworth
there
nothing
to
hurt
you
in
this
house
nothing
at
all
an
admonition
which
i
am
sure
her
young
mistresses
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
utter
if
they
had
been
made
acquainted
with
her
intention
but
though
in
a
state
of
high
expectation
and
listening
as
i
supposed
with
every
faculty
alert
the
sounds
i
apprehended
delayed
so
long
that
i
began
after
an
hour
or
two
unaccountably
to
nod
in
my
chair
and
before
i
knew
it
i
was
asleep
with
the
whistle
in
my
hand
and
my
feet
pressed
against
the
panels
of
the
door
i
had
set
myself
to
guard
how
deep
that
sleep
was
or
how
long
i
indulged
in
it
i
can
only
judge
from
the
state
of
emotion
in
which
i
found
myself
when
i
suddenly
woke
i
was
sitting
there
still
but
my
usually
calm
frame
was
in
a
violent
tremble
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
stir
much
more
to
speak
some
one
or
something
was
at
my
door
an
instant
and
my
powerful
nature
would
have
asserted
itself
but
before
this
could
happen
the
stealthy
step
drew
nearer
and
i
heard
the
quiet
almost
noiseless
insertion
of
a
key
into
the
lock
and
the
quick
turn
which
made
me
a
prisoner
this
with
the
indignation
it
caused
brought
me
quickly
to
myself
so
the
door
had
a
key
after
all
and
this
was
the
use
it
was
reserved
for
rising
quickly
to
my
feet
i
shouted
out
the
names
of
loreen
lucetta
and
william
but
received
no
other
response
than
the
rapid
withdrawal
of
feet
down
the
corridor
then
i
felt
for
the
whistle
which
had
somehow
slipped
from
my
hand
but
failed
to
find
it
in
the
darkness
nor
when
i
went
to
search
for
the
matches
to
relight
the
candle
i
had
left
standing
on
a
table
near
by
could
i
by
any
means
succeed
in
igniting
one
so
that
i
presently
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
myself
shut
up
in
my
room
with
no
means
of
communicating
with
the
world
outside
and
with
no
light
to
render
the
situation
tolerable
this
was
having
the
tables
turned
upon
me
with
a
vengeance
and
in
a
way
for
which
i
could
not
account
i
could
understand
why
they
had
locked
me
in
the
room
and
why
they
had
not
heeded
my
cry
of
indignant
appeal
but
i
could
not
comprehend
how
my
whistle
came
to
be
gone
nor
why
the
matches
which
were
sufficiently
plentiful
in
the
safe
refused
one
and
all
to
perform
their
office
on
these
points
i
felt
it
necessary
to
come
to
some
sort
of
conclusion
before
i
proceeded
to
invent
some
way
out
of
my
difficulties
so
dropping
on
my
knees
by
the
chair
in
which
i
had
been
sitting
i
began
a
quiet
search
for
the
petty
object
upon
which
nevertheless
hung
not
my
safety
perhaps
but
all
chances
of
success
in
an
undertaking
which
was
every
moment
growing
more
serious
i
did
not
find
it
but
i
did
find
where
it
had
gone
in
the
floor
near
the
door
my
hand
encountered
a
hole
which
had
been
covered
up
by
a
rug
early
in
the
evening
but
which
i
now
distinctly
remembered
having
pushed
aside
with
my
feet
when
i
took
my
seat
there
this
aperture
was
not
large
but
it
was
so
deep
that
my
hand
failed
to
reach
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
into
this
hole
by
some
freak
of
chance
had
slipped
the
small
whistle
i
had
so
indiscreetly
taken
into
my
hand
the
mystery
of
the
matches
was
less
easy
of
solution
so
i
let
it
go
after
a
moment
of
indecisive
thought
and
bent
my
energies
once
again
to
listen
when
suddenly
and
without
the
least
warning
there
rose
from
somewhere
in
the
house
a
cry
so
wild
and
unearthly
that
i
started
up
appalled
and
for
a
moment
could
not
tell
whether
i
was
laboring
under
some
fearful
dream
or
a
still
more
fearful
reality
a
rushing
of
feet
in
the
distance
and
an
involuntary
murmur
of
voices
soon
satisfied
me
however
on
this
score
and
drawing
upon
every
energy
i
possessed
i
listened
for
a
renewal
of
the
cry
which
was
yet
curdling
my
blood
but
none
came
and
presently
all
was
as
still
as
if
no
sound
had
arisen
to
disturb
the
midnight
though
every
fibre
in
my
body
told
me
that
the
event
i
had
feared
the
event
of
which
i
hardly
dared
mention
the
character
even
to
myself
had
taken
place
and
that
i
who
was
sent
there
to
forestall
it
was
not
only
a
prisoner
in
my
room
but
a
prisoner
through
my
own
folly
and
my
inordinate
love
of
tea
the
anger
with
which
i
contemplated
this
fact
and
the
remorse
i
felt
at
the
consequences
which
had
befallen
the
innocent
victim
whose
scream
i
had
just
heard
made
me
very
indeed
and
after
an
ineffectual
effort
to
make
my
voice
heard
from
the
window
i
called
my
usual
philosophy
to
my
aid
and
decided
that
since
the
worst
had
happened
and
i
a
prisoner
had
to
await
events
like
any
other
weak
and
defenceless
woman
i
might
as
well
do
it
with
calmness
and
in
a
way
to
win
my
own
approval
at
least
the
dupe
of
william
and
his
sisters
i
would
not
be
the
dupe
of
my
own
fears
or
even
of
my
own
regrets
the
consequence
was
a
renewed
equanimity
and
a
gentle
brooding
over
the
one
event
of
the
day
which
brought
no
regret
in
its
train
the
ride
with
trohm
and
the
acquaintanceship
to
which
it
had
led
were
topics
upon
which
i
could
rest
with
great
soothing
effect
through
the
weary
hours
stretching
between
me
and
daylight
consequently
of
trohm
i
thought
whether
the
almost
deathly
quiet
into
which
the
house
had
now
fallen
or
the
comforting
nature
of
my
meditations
held
inexorably
to
the
topic
i
had
chosen
acted
as
a
soporific
upon
me
i
can
not
tell
but
greatly
as
i
dislike
to
admit
it
feeling
sure
that
you
will
expect
to
hear
i
kept
myself
awake
all
that
night
i
insensibly
sank
from
great
alertness
to
an
easy
indifference
to
my
surroundings
and
from
that
to
vague
dreams
in
which
beds
of
lilies
and
trellises
covered
with
roses
mingled
strangely
with
narrow
winding
staircases
whose
tops
ended
in
the
swaying
branches
of
great
trees
and
so
into
quiet
and
a
nothingness
that
were
only
broken
into
by
a
rap
at
my
door
and
a
cheerful
eight
the
young
ladies
are
waiting
i
bounded
literally
bounded
from
my
chair
such
a
summons
after
such
a
night
what
did
it
mean
i
was
sitting
half
dressed
in
my
chair
before
my
door
in
a
straightened
and
uncomfortable
attitude
and
therefore
had
not
dreamed
that
i
had
been
upon
the
watch
all
night
yet
the
sunshine
in
the
room
the
cheery
tones
such
as
i
had
not
heard
even
from
this
woman
before
seemed
to
argue
that
my
imagination
had
played
me
false
and
that
no
horrors
had
come
to
disturb
my
rest
or
render
my
waking
distressing
stretching
out
my
hand
toward
the
door
i
was
about
to
open
it
when
i
bethought
me
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
said
i
somebody
was
careful
enough
of
my
safety
to
fasten
me
in
last
night
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
came
from
outside
the
door
there
is
no
key
here
the
door
is
not
locked
shall
i
open
it
and
come
in
i
was
about
to
say
yes
in
my
anxiety
to
talk
to
the
woman
but
remembering
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
letting
it
be
seen
to
what
an
extent
i
had
carried
my
suspicions
i
hastily
disrobed
and
crept
into
bed
pulling
the
coverings
about
me
i
assumed
a
comfortable
attitude
and
then
cried
come
in
the
door
immediately
opened
there
what
did
i
tell
you
locked
this
door
why
the
key
has
been
lost
for
months
i
can
not
help
it
i
protested
but
with
little
if
any
asperity
for
it
did
not
suit
me
that
she
should
see
i
was
moved
by
any
extraordinary
feeling
a
key
was
put
in
that
lock
about
midnight
and
i
was
locked
in
it
was
about
the
time
some
one
screamed
in
your
own
part
of
the
house
screamed
her
brows
took
a
fine
pucker
of
perplexity
oh
that
must
have
been
miss
lucetta
lucetta
yes
she
had
an
attack
i
believe
poor
miss
lucetta
she
often
has
attacks
like
that
confounded
for
the
woman
spoke
so
naturally
that
only
a
suspicious
nature
like
mine
would
fail
to
have
been
deceived
by
it
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
and
gave
her
an
indignant
look
yet
you
said
just
now
that
the
young
ladies
were
expecting
me
to
breakfast
yes
and
why
not
her
look
was
absolutely
guileless
miss
lucetta
sometimes
keeps
us
up
half
the
night
but
she
does
not
miss
breakfast
on
that
account
when
the
turn
is
over
she
is
as
well
as
ever
she
was
a
fine
young
lady
miss
lucetta
i
lose
my
two
hands
for
her
any
day
she
certainly
is
a
remarkable
girl
i
declared
not
however
as
dryly
as
i
felt
i
can
hardly
believe
i
dreamed
about
the
key
let
me
feel
of
your
pocket
i
laughed
she
without
the
smallest
hesitancy
pulled
aside
her
apron
i
am
sorry
you
put
so
little
confidence
in
my
word
but
lor
me
what
you
heard
is
nothing
to
what
some
of
our
guests
have
complained
of
in
the
days
i
mean
when
we
did
have
guests
i
have
known
them
to
scream
out
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
vow
they
saw
white
figures
creeping
up
and
down
the
halls
all
nonsense
but
believed
in
by
some
folks
you
do
look
as
if
you
believed
in
ghosts
and
i
do
i
said
not
a
whit
it
would
be
a
poor
way
to
try
to
frighten
me
how
is
william
this
morning
oh
he
well
and
feeding
the
dogs
what
made
you
think
of
him
politeness
hannah
i
found
myself
forced
to
say
he
the
only
man
in
the
house
why
should
i
think
of
him
she
fingered
her
apron
a
minute
and
laughed
i
did
know
you
liked
him
he
so
rough
it
is
everybody
who
understands
him
she
said
must
one
understand
a
person
to
like
him
i
queried
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
might
have
dreamed
about
that
key
i
do
know
she
said
i
do
always
understand
miss
lucetta
but
i
like
her
through
and
through
as
i
like
this
little
finger
and
holding
up
this
member
to
my
inspection
she
crossed
the
room
for
my
which
she
proposed
to
fill
with
hot
water
i
followed
her
closely
with
my
eyes
when
she
came
back
i
saw
her
attention
caught
by
the
break
in
the
flooring
which
she
had
not
noticed
on
entering
oh
she
exclaimed
what
a
shame
her
honest
face
coloring
as
she
drew
the
rug
back
over
the
small
black
gap
i
am
sure
she
cried
you
must
think
very
poorly
of
us
but
i
assure
you
honest
poverty
nothing
but
honest
poverty
as
makes
them
so
neglectful
and
with
an
air
as
far
removed
from
mystery
as
her
frank
manner
seemed
to
be
from
falsehood
she
slid
from
the
room
with
a
kind
do
hurry
it
is
miss
knollys
turn
in
the
kitchen
and
she
is
as
quick
as
miss
lucetta
humph
thought
i
supposing
i
had
called
in
the
police
but
by
the
time
she
had
returned
with
the
water
my
doubts
had
reawakened
she
was
not
changed
in
manner
though
i
have
no
doubt
she
had
recounted
all
that
i
had
said
below
but
i
was
for
i
remembered
the
matches
and
thought
i
saw
a
way
of
tripping
her
up
in
her
just
as
she
was
leaving
me
for
the
second
time
i
called
her
back
what
is
the
matter
with
your
matches
i
asked
i
could
make
them
light
last
night
with
a
wholly
undisturbed
countenance
she
turned
toward
the
bureau
and
took
up
the
china
trinket
that
held
the
few
remaining
matches
i
had
not
scraped
on
the
piece
of
sandpaper
i
myself
had
fastened
up
alongside
the
door
a
sheepish
cry
of
dismay
at
once
escaped
her
why
these
are
old
matches
she
declared
showing
me
the
box
in
which
a
or
so
burned
matches
stood
with
their
burned
tops
all
turned
down
i
thought
they
were
all
right
i
afraid
we
are
a
little
short
of
matches
i
did
not
like
to
tell
her
what
i
thought
about
it
but
it
made
me
doubly
anxious
to
join
the
young
ladies
at
breakfast
and
judge
for
myself
from
their
conduct
and
expression
if
i
had
been
deceived
by
my
own
fears
into
taking
for
realities
the
phantasies
of
a
nightmare
or
whether
i
was
correct
in
ascribing
to
fact
that
episode
of
the
key
with
all
the
possibilities
that
lay
behind
it
i
did
not
let
my
anxiety
however
stand
in
the
way
of
my
duty
gryce
had
bid
me
carry
the
whistle
he
had
sent
me
constantly
about
my
person
and
i
felt
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
reproach
me
if
i
left
my
room
without
making
some
endeavor
to
recover
this
lost
article
how
to
do
this
without
aid
or
appliances
of
any
kind
was
a
problem
i
knew
where
it
was
but
i
could
not
see
it
much
less
reach
it
besides
they
were
waiting
for
me
never
a
pleasant
thought
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
lower
into
the
hole
a
lighted
candle
hung
by
a
string
looking
over
my
effects
i
chose
out
a
hairpin
a
candle
and
two
corset
laces
pardon
me
i
am
as
modest
as
most
of
my
sex
but
i
am
not
squeamish
corset
laces
are
strings
and
as
such
only
i
present
them
to
your
notice
i
should
like
to
have
added
a
to
my
collection
but
not
having
as
yet
discarded
the
neatly
laced
boot
of
my
ancestor
i
could
only
produce
a
small
article
from
my
which
shall
remain
unmentioned
as
i
presently
discarded
it
and
turned
my
whole
attention
to
the
other
objects
i
have
named
a
poor
array
but
out
of
them
i
hoped
to
find
the
means
of
fishing
up
my
lost
whistle
my
intention
was
to
lower
first
a
lighted
candle
into
the
hole
by
means
of
a
string
tied
about
its
middle
then
to
drop
a
line
on
the
whistle
thus
discovered
and
draw
it
up
with
the
point
of
a
bent
hairpin
which
i
fondly
hoped
i
could
make
do
the
service
of
a
hook
to
think
was
to
try
the
candle
was
soon
down
in
the
hole
and
by
its
light
the
whistle
was
easily
seen
the
string
and
bent
hairpin
went
down
next
i
was
successful
in
hooking
the
prize
and
proceeded
to
pull
it
up
with
great
care
for
an
instant
i
realized
what
a
ridiculous
figure
i
was
cutting
stooping
over
a
hole
in
the
floor
on
both
knees
a
string
in
each
hand
leading
apparently
to
nowhere
and
i
at
work
cautiously
steadying
one
and
as
carefully
pulling
on
the
other
having
hooked
the
string
holding
the
whistle
over
the
first
finger
of
the
hand
holding
the
candle
i
may
have
become
too
to
notice
the
slight
release
of
weight
on
the
whistle
hand
whatever
the
reason
when
the
end
of
the
string
came
in
sight
there
was
no
whistle
on
it
the
charred
end
showed
me
that
the
candle
had
burned
the
cord
letting
the
whistle
fall
again
out
of
reach
down
went
the
candle
again
it
touched
bottom
but
no
whistle
was
to
be
seen
after
a
long
and
fruitless
search
i
concluded
to
abandon
my
excursion
and
rising
from
my
cramped
and
undignified
position
i
proceeded
to
pull
up
the
candle
to
my
surprise
and
delight
i
found
the
whistle
firmly
stuck
to
the
lower
side
of
it
some
drops
of
candle
grease
had
fallen
upon
the
whistle
where
it
lay
the
candle
coming
in
contact
with
it
the
two
had
adhered
and
i
became
indebted
to
accident
rather
than
to
acumen
for
the
restoration
of
the
precious
article
xix
a
knot
of
crape
i
was
prepared
for
some
change
in
the
appearance
of
my
young
hostesses
but
not
for
so
great
a
one
as
i
saw
on
entering
the
that
memorable
morning
the
blinds
which
were
always
half
closed
were
now
wide
open
and
under
the
cheerful
influence
of
the
light
which
was
thus
allowed
to
enter
the
table
and
all
its
appointments
had
a
much
less
dreary
look
than
before
behind
the
urn
sat
miss
knollys
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
in
the
window
william
stood
whistling
a
cheerful
air
unrebuked
lucetta
was
not
present
but
to
my
great
astonishment
she
presently
walked
in
with
her
hands
laden
with
sprays
of
which
she
flung
down
in
the
centre
of
the
board
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
any
attempt
made
by
any
of
them
to
lighten
the
sombreness
of
their
surroundings
and
it
was
also
the
first
time
i
had
seen
the
three
together
i
was
more
disconcerted
by
this
simple
show
of
improved
spirits
than
i
like
to
acknowledge
in
the
first
place
they
were
natural
and
not
forced
and
secondly
they
were
to
all
appearance
unconscious
they
were
not
marked
enough
to
show
relief
and
in
lucetta
especially
did
not
serve
to
hide
the
underlying
melancholy
of
a
disappointed
girl
yet
it
was
not
what
i
expected
from
my
supposed
experiences
of
the
night
and
led
me
to
answer
a
little
warily
when
with
a
frank
laugh
loreen
exclaimed
so
you
have
lost
your
character
as
a
practical
woman
miss
butterworth
hannah
tells
me
you
were
the
victim
of
a
ghostly
visit
last
night
hannah
gossips
unmercifully
was
my
cautious
and
somewhat
peevish
reply
if
i
chose
to
dream
that
i
was
locked
into
my
room
by
some
erratic
spectre
i
can
not
see
why
she
should
take
the
confession
of
my
folly
out
of
my
mouth
i
was
going
to
relate
the
fact
myself
with
all
the
accompaniments
of
rushing
steps
and
wild
and
unearthly
cries
which
are
expected
by
the
listeners
to
a
veritable
ghost
story
but
now
i
have
simply
to
defend
myself
from
a
charge
of
credulity
it
too
bad
miss
knollys
much
too
bad
i
did
not
come
to
a
haunted
house
for
this
my
manner
rather
than
my
words
seemed
to
completely
deceive
them
perhaps
it
deceived
myself
for
i
began
to
feel
a
loss
of
the
depression
which
had
weighed
upon
me
ever
since
that
scream
rang
in
my
ears
at
midnight
it
disappeared
still
further
when
lucetta
said
if
your
ramblings
through
the
old
rooms
on
this
floor
were
the
occasion
of
this
nightmare
you
must
be
prepared
for
a
recurrence
of
the
same
for
i
am
going
to
take
you
through
the
upper
rooms
myself
this
morning
is
that
the
programme
loreen
or
have
you
changed
your
mind
and
planned
a
drive
for
miss
butterworth
she
shall
do
both
loreen
answered
when
she
is
tired
of
tramping
through
dusty
chambers
and
examining
the
decayed
remnants
of
old
furniture
which
encumber
them
william
stands
ready
to
drive
her
over
the
hills
where
she
will
find
views
well
worth
her
attention
thank
you
said
i
it
is
a
pleasant
prospect
but
inwardly
i
uttered
anything
but
thanks
rather
asked
myself
if
i
had
not
played
the
part
of
a
fool
in
ascribing
so
much
importance
to
the
events
of
the
past
night
and
decided
almost
without
an
argument
that
i
had
however
beliefs
die
hard
in
a
mind
like
mine
and
though
i
was
ready
to
consider
that
an
inflamed
imagination
may
often
carry
us
beyond
the
bounds
of
fact
and
even
into
the
realm
of
fancy
and
misconception
i
yet
was
not
ready
to
give
up
my
suspicions
altogether
or
to
acknowledge
that
i
had
no
foundation
for
the
fear
that
something
uncanny
if
not
awful
had
taken
place
under
this
roof
the
night
before
the
very
naturalness
i
observed
in
this
hitherto
restrained
trio
might
be
the
result
of
the
removal
of
some
great
strain
and
if
that
was
the
case
ah
well
alertness
is
the
motto
of
the
truly
wise
it
is
when
vigilance
sleeps
that
the
enemy
gains
the
victory
i
would
not
let
myself
be
deceived
even
at
the
cost
of
a
little
ridicule
amelia
butterworth
was
still
awake
even
under
a
semblance
of
suspicion
my
footsteps
were
not
dogged
after
this
as
they
had
hitherto
been
in
my
movements
about
the
house
i
was
allowed
to
go
and
come
and
even
to
stray
into
the
second
long
corridor
without
any
other
let
than
my
own
discretion
and
good
breeding
lucetta
joined
me
to
be
sure
after
a
while
but
only
as
guide
and
companion
she
took
me
into
rooms
i
forgot
the
next
minute
and
into
others
i
remember
to
this
day
as
quaint
memorials
of
a
past
ever
and
always
interesting
to
me
we
ransacked
the
house
yet
after
all
was
over
and
i
sat
down
to
rest
in
my
own
room
two
formidable
questions
rose
in
my
mind
for
which
i
found
no
satisfactory
answer
why
with
so
many
more
or
less
attractive
bedchambers
at
their
command
had
they
chosen
to
put
me
into
a
hole
where
the
very
flooring
was
unsafe
and
the
outlook
the
most
dismal
that
could
be
imagined
and
why
in
all
our
peregrinations
in
and
out
of
rooms
had
we
always
passed
one
door
without
entering
she
had
said
that
it
was
william
a
sufficient
explanation
if
true
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
but
the
change
of
countenance
with
which
she
passed
it
and
the
sudden
lightening
of
her
tread
so
instinctive
that
she
was
totally
unconscious
of
it
marked
that
door
as
one
it
would
be
my
duty
to
enter
if
fate
should
yet
give
me
the
opportunity
that
it
was
the
one
in
communication
with
the
flower
parlor
i
felt
satisfied
but
in
order
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
resolved
upon
a
tour
through
the
shrubbery
outside
that
i
might
compare
the
location
of
the
window
having
the
chipped
blind
with
that
of
this
room
which
was
as
well
as
i
could
calculate
the
third
from
the
rear
on
the
side
when
therefore
william
called
up
to
know
if
i
was
ready
for
my
drive
i
answered
back
that
i
found
myself
very
tired
and
would
be
glad
to
exchange
the
pleasure
he
offered
for
a
visit
to
the
stables
this
as
i
expected
caused
considerable
comment
and
some
disturbance
they
wanted
me
to
repeat
my
experience
of
the
day
before
and
spend
two
if
not
more
hours
of
the
morning
out
of
the
house
but
i
did
not
mean
to
gratify
them
indeed
i
felt
that
my
duty
held
me
to
the
house
and
was
so
persistent
in
my
wishes
or
rather
in
my
declaration
of
them
that
all
opposition
had
to
give
way
even
in
the
stubborn
william
i
thought
you
had
a
dread
of
dogs
was
the
final
remark
with
which
he
endeavored
to
turn
me
aside
from
my
purpose
i
have
three
in
the
barn
and
two
in
the
stable
and
they
make
a
great
fuss
when
i
come
around
i
assure
you
then
they
will
have
enough
to
do
without
noticing
me
said
i
with
a
brazen
assumption
of
courage
sufficiently
surprising
if
i
had
had
any
real
intention
of
invading
a
place
so
guarded
but
i
had
not
i
no
more
meant
to
enter
the
stables
than
to
jump
off
the
housetop
but
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
start
for
them
and
make
the
start
from
the
left
wing
of
the
house
how
i
managed
the
intractable
william
and
led
him
as
i
did
from
bush
to
bush
and
shrub
to
shrub
up
and
down
the
length
of
that
interminable
façade
of
the
left
wing
would
make
an
interesting
story
in
itself
the
curiosity
i
showed
in
plants
even
such
plants
as
had
survived
the
neglect
that
had
made
a
wilderness
of
this
garden
the
indifference
which
contrary
to
all
my
habits
i
persisted
in
manifesting
to
every
inconvenience
i
encountered
in
the
way
of
straightforward
walking
to
any
object
i
set
my
fancy
upon
examining
the
knowledge
i
exhibited
and
the
interest
which
i
took
it
for
granted
he
felt
in
all
i
discovered
and
all
i
imparted
to
him
would
form
the
basis
of
a
farce
of
no
ordinary
merit
had
it
not
had
its
birth
in
interests
and
intents
bordering
on
the
tragic
a
row
of
bushes
of
various
species
ran
along
the
wall
and
covered
in
some
instances
the
lower
ledges
of
the
first
row
of
windows
as
i
made
for
a
certain
shrub
which
i
had
observed
growing
near
what
i
supposed
to
be
the
casement
from
whose
blind
i
had
chipped
a
small
sliver
i
allowed
my
enthusiasm
to
bubble
over
in
my
evident
desire
to
display
my
erudition
this
said
i
is
without
any
doubt
at
all
a
stunted
but
undoubted
specimen
of
that
rare
tree
found
seldom
north
of
the
thirtieth
degree
the
i
have
never
seen
it
but
once
before
and
that
was
in
the
botanical
gardens
in
washington
note
its
leaves
you
have
noted
its
flowers
smaller
undoubtedly
than
they
should
be
but
then
you
must
acknowledge
it
has
been
in
a
measure
neglected
are
they
not
fine
here
i
pulled
a
branch
down
which
interfered
with
my
view
of
the
window
there
was
no
chip
visible
in
the
blinds
thus
discovered
seeing
this
i
let
the
branch
go
but
the
oddest
feature
of
this
tree
and
one
with
which
you
are
perhaps
not
acquainted
i
wonder
if
anybody
is
is
that
it
will
not
grow
within
twenty
feet
of
any
plant
which
scatters
pollen
see
for
yourself
this
next
shrub
bears
no
flower
i
was
moving
along
the
wall
nor
this
i
drew
down
a
branch
as
i
spoke
caught
sight
of
the
mark
i
was
looking
for
and
let
the
bough
spring
back
i
had
found
the
window
i
wanted
his
grunts
and
groans
during
all
this
formed
a
running
accompaniment
which
would
have
afforded
me
great
secret
amusement
had
my
purpose
been
less
serious
as
it
was
i
could
pay
but
little
attention
to
him
especially
after
i
had
stepped
back
far
enough
to
take
a
glance
at
the
window
over
the
one
i
had
just
located
as
that
of
the
flower
parlor
it
was
as
i
expected
the
third
one
from
the
rear
corner
but
it
was
not
this
fact
which
gave
me
a
thrill
of
feeling
so
strong
that
i
have
never
had
harder
work
to
preserve
my
equanimity
was
the
knot
of
black
crape
with
which
the
shutters
were
tied
xx
questions
i
kept
the
promise
i
had
made
to
myself
and
did
not
go
to
the
stables
had
i
intended
to
go
there
i
could
not
have
done
so
after
the
discovery
i
have
just
mentioned
it
awakened
too
many
thoughts
and
contradictory
surmises
if
this
knot
was
a
signal
for
whom
was
this
signal
meant
if
it
was
a
mere
acknowledgment
of
death
how
reconcile
the
sentimentality
which
prompted
such
an
acknowledgment
with
the
monstrous
and
diseased
passions
lying
at
the
base
of
the
whole
dreadful
occurrence
lastly
if
it
was
the
result
of
pure
carelessness
a
bit
of
crape
having
been
caught
up
and
used
for
a
purpose
for
which
any
ordinary
string
would
have
answered
what
a
wonderful
coincidence
between
it
and
my
thoughts
a
coincidence
indeed
amounting
almost
to
miracle
marvelling
at
the
whole
affair
and
deciding
nothing
i
allowed
myself
to
stroll
down
alone
to
the
gate
william
having
left
me
at
my
peremptory
refusal
to
drag
my
skirts
any
longer
through
the
briers
the
day
being
bright
and
the
sunshine
warm
the
road
looked
less
gloomy
than
usual
especially
in
the
direction
of
the
village
and
deacon
spear
cottage
the
fact
is
that
anything
seemed
better
than
the
grim
and
lowering
walls
of
the
house
behind
me
if
my
home
was
there
so
was
my
dread
and
i
welcomed
the
sight
of
mother
jane
heavy
figure
bent
over
her
herbs
at
the
door
of
her
hut
a
few
paces
to
my
left
where
the
road
turned
had
she
not
been
deaf
i
believed
i
would
have
called
her
as
it
was
i
contented
myself
with
watching
the
awkward
swayings
of
her
body
as
she
pottered
to
and
fro
among
her
turnips
and
carrots
my
eyes
were
still
on
her
when
i
suddenly
heard
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
on
the
highway
looking
up
i
encountered
the
trim
figure
of
trohm
bending
to
me
from
a
fine
sorrel
good
morning
miss
butterworth
it
a
great
relief
to
me
to
see
you
in
such
good
health
and
spirits
this
morning
were
the
pleasant
words
with
which
he
endeavored
perhaps
to
explain
his
presence
in
a
spot
more
or
less
under
a
ban
it
was
certainly
a
surprise
what
right
had
i
to
look
for
such
attentions
from
a
man
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
only
the
day
before
it
touched
me
little
as
i
am
in
the
habit
of
allowing
myself
to
be
ruled
by
trivial
sentimentalities
and
though
i
was
discreet
enough
to
avoid
any
further
recognition
of
his
kindness
than
was
his
due
from
a
lady
of
great
he
was
evidently
sufficiently
gratified
by
my
response
to
draw
rein
and
pause
for
a
moment
conversation
under
the
pine
trees
this
for
the
moment
seemed
so
natural
that
i
forgot
that
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
might
be
watching
me
from
the
windows
behind
us
eyes
which
might
wonder
at
a
meeting
which
to
the
foolish
understandings
of
the
young
might
have
the
look
of
premeditation
but
pshaw
i
am
talking
as
if
i
were
twenty
instead
of
well
i
will
leave
you
to
consult
our
family
record
on
that
point
there
are
certain
secrets
which
even
the
wisest
among
us
can
not
be
blamed
for
preserving
how
did
you
pass
the
night
was
trohm
first
question
i
hope
in
all
due
peace
and
quiet
thank
you
i
returned
not
seeing
why
i
should
increase
his
anxiety
in
my
regard
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
i
had
a
dream
but
dreams
are
to
be
expected
where
one
has
to
pass
a
empty
rooms
to
apartment
he
could
not
restrain
his
curiosity
a
dream
he
repeated
i
do
not
believe
in
sleep
that
is
broken
by
dreams
unless
they
are
of
the
most
cheerful
sort
possible
and
i
judge
from
what
you
say
that
yours
were
not
cheerful
i
wanted
to
confide
in
him
i
felt
that
in
a
way
he
had
a
right
to
know
what
had
happened
to
me
or
what
i
thought
had
happened
to
me
under
this
roof
and
yet
i
did
not
speak
what
i
could
tell
would
sound
so
puerile
in
the
broad
sunshine
that
enveloped
us
i
merely
remarked
that
cheerfulness
was
not
to
be
expected
in
a
domicile
so
given
over
to
the
ravages
of
time
and
then
with
that
lightness
and
versatility
which
characterize
me
under
certain
exigencies
i
introduced
a
topic
we
could
discuss
without
any
embarrassment
to
himself
or
me
do
you
see
mother
jane
over
there
i
asked
i
had
some
talk
with
her
yesterday
she
seems
like
a
harmless
imbecile
very
harmless
he
acquiesced
her
only
fault
is
greed
that
is
insatiable
yet
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
take
her
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
this
place
nothing
could
do
that
i
think
she
believes
that
her
daughter
lizzie
is
still
alive
and
will
come
back
to
the
hut
some
day
it
very
sad
when
you
think
that
the
girl
dead
and
has
been
dead
nearly
forty
years
why
does
she
harp
on
numbers
i
asked
i
heard
her
mutter
certain
ones
over
and
over
that
is
a
mystery
none
of
us
have
ever
been
able
to
solve
said
he
possibly
she
has
no
reason
for
it
the
vagaries
of
the
witless
are
often
quite
unaccountable
he
remained
looking
at
me
long
after
he
had
finished
speaking
not
i
felt
sure
from
any
connection
he
found
between
what
he
had
just
said
and
anything
to
be
observed
in
me
but
from
well
i
was
glad
that
i
had
been
carefully
trained
in
my
youth
to
pay
the
greatest
attention
to
my
morning
toilets
any
woman
can
look
well
at
night
and
many
women
in
the
flush
of
a
bright
afternoon
but
the
woman
who
looks
well
in
the
morning
needs
not
always
to
be
young
to
attract
the
appreciative
gaze
of
a
man
of
real
penetration
trohm
was
such
a
man
and
i
did
not
begrudge
him
the
pleasure
he
showed
in
my
neat
gray
silk
and
carefully
adjusted
collar
but
he
said
nothing
and
a
short
silence
ensued
which
was
perhaps
more
of
a
compliment
than
otherwise
then
he
uttered
a
short
sigh
and
lifted
the
reins
if
only
i
were
not
debarred
from
entering
he
smiled
with
a
short
gesture
toward
the
house
i
did
not
answer
even
i
understand
that
on
occasion
the
tongue
plays
but
a
sorry
part
in
interviews
of
this
nature
he
sighed
again
and
uttered
some
short
encouragement
to
his
horse
which
started
that
animal
up
and
sent
him
slowly
pacing
down
the
road
toward
the
cheerful
clearing
whither
my
own
eyes
were
looking
with
what
i
was
determined
should
not
be
construed
even
by
the
most
sanguine
into
a
glance
of
anything
like
wistfulness
as
he
went
he
made
a
bow
i
have
never
seen
surpassed
in
my
own
parlor
in
gramercy
park
and
upon
my
bestowing
upon
him
a
return
nod
glanced
up
at
the
house
with
an
intentness
which
seemed
to
increase
as
some
object
invisible
to
me
at
that
moment
caught
his
eye
as
that
eye
was
directed
toward
the
left
wing
and
lifted
as
far
as
the
second
row
of
windows
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
if
he
had
seen
the
knot
of
crape
which
had
produced
upon
me
so
lugubrious
an
impression
before
i
could
make
sure
of
this
he
had
passed
from
sight
and
the
highway
fell
again
into
shadow
why
i
hardly
knew
for
the
sun
certainly
had
been
shining
a
few
minutes
before
xxi
mother
jane
well
well
what
did
trohm
want
here
this
morning
cried
a
harsh
voice
from
amid
the
tangled
walks
behind
me
seems
to
me
he
finds
this
place
pretty
interesting
all
of
a
sudden
i
turned
upon
the
intruder
with
a
look
that
should
have
daunted
him
i
had
recognized
william
courteous
tones
and
was
in
no
mood
to
endure
a
questioning
so
unbecoming
in
one
of
his
age
to
one
of
mine
but
as
i
met
his
eye
which
had
something
in
it
besides
anger
and
suspicion
something
that
was
quizzical
if
not
impertinent
i
changed
my
intention
and
bestowed
upon
him
a
conciliatory
smile
which
i
hope
escaped
the
eye
of
the
good
angel
who
records
against
man
all
his
small
hypocrisies
and
petty
deceits
trohm
rides
for
his
health
said
i
seeing
me
looking
up
the
road
at
mother
jane
he
stopped
to
tell
me
some
of
the
idiosyncrasies
of
that
old
woman
a
very
harmless
courtesy
mr
knollys
very
he
echoed
not
without
a
touch
of
sarcasm
i
only
hope
that
is
all
he
muttered
with
a
sidelong
look
back
at
the
house
lucetta
has
a
particle
of
belief
in
that
man
friendship
or
rather
she
believes
he
never
goes
anywhere
without
a
particular
intention
and
i
do
believe
she
right
or
why
should
he
come
spying
around
here
just
at
a
time
when
he
caught
himself
up
with
almost
a
look
of
terror
when
when
you
are
here
he
completed
lamely
i
do
not
think
i
retorted
more
angrily
than
the
occasion
perhaps
warranted
that
the
word
spying
applies
to
trohm
but
if
it
does
what
has
he
to
gain
from
a
pause
at
the
gate
and
a
word
to
such
a
new
acquaintance
as
i
am
i
do
know
william
persisted
suspiciously
trohm
a
sharp
fellow
if
there
was
anything
to
see
he
would
see
it
without
half
looking
but
there
is
you
do
know
of
anything
wrong
here
do
you
which
such
a
man
as
that
hand
in
glove
with
the
police
as
we
know
him
to
be
might
consider
himself
interested
in
astonished
both
at
this
blundering
committal
of
himself
and
at
the
certain
sort
of
anxious
confidence
he
showed
in
me
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
since
if
half
my
suspicions
were
true
this
man
must
not
know
that
my
perspicacity
was
more
to
be
feared
than
even
trohm
was
if
trohm
shows
an
increased
interest
in
this
household
during
the
last
two
days
said
i
with
a
heroic
defiance
of
ridicule
which
i
hope
gryce
has
duly
appreciated
i
beg
leave
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
on
yesterday
morning
he
came
to
deliver
a
letter
addressed
to
me
which
had
inadvertently
been
left
at
his
house
and
that
this
morning
he
called
to
inquire
how
i
had
spent
the
night
which
in
consideration
of
the
ghosts
which
are
said
to
haunt
this
house
and
the
strange
and
uncanny
apparitions
which
only
three
nights
ago
made
the
entrance
to
this
lane
hideous
to
one
pair
of
eyes
at
least
should
not
cause
a
gentleman
son
like
yourself
any
astonishment
it
does
not
seem
odd
to
me
i
assure
you
he
laughed
i
meant
he
should
and
losing
almost
instantly
his
air
of
doubt
and
suspicion
turned
toward
the
gate
from
which
i
had
just
moved
away
muttering
well
it
a
small
matter
to
me
anyway
it
only
the
girls
that
are
afraid
of
trohm
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
but
losing
saracen
who
has
pined
like
the
deuce
at
his
long
confinement
in
the
court
hear
him
now
just
hear
him
and
i
could
hear
the
low
and
unhappy
moaning
of
the
hound
distinctly
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sound
and
i
was
almost
tempted
to
bid
william
unloose
the
dog
but
thought
better
of
it
by
the
way
said
he
speaking
of
mother
jane
i
have
a
message
to
her
from
the
girls
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
speak
to
the
poor
woman
alarmed
by
his
politeness
more
than
i
ever
have
been
by
his
roughness
and
inconsiderate
sarcasms
i
surveyed
him
inquiringly
as
he
left
the
gate
and
did
not
know
whether
to
stand
my
ground
or
retreat
to
the
house
i
decided
to
stand
my
ground
a
message
to
this
woman
seeming
to
me
a
matter
of
some
interest
i
was
glad
i
did
for
after
some
five
minutes
absence
during
which
he
had
followed
her
into
the
house
i
saw
him
come
back
again
in
a
state
of
sullen
displeasure
which
however
partially
disappeared
when
he
saw
me
still
standing
by
the
gate
ah
miss
butterworth
you
can
do
me
a
favor
the
old
creature
is
in
one
of
her
stubborn
fits
and
wo
give
me
a
hearing
she
may
not
be
so
deaf
to
you
she
is
apt
to
be
to
women
will
you
cross
the
road
and
speak
to
her
i
will
go
with
you
you
need
be
afraid
the
way
he
said
this
the
confidence
he
expected
to
inspire
had
almost
a
ghastly
effect
upon
me
did
he
know
or
suspect
that
the
only
thing
i
feared
in
this
lane
was
he
evidently
not
for
he
met
my
eye
quite
confidently
it
would
not
do
to
shake
his
faith
at
such
a
moment
as
this
so
calling
upon
providence
to
see
me
safely
through
this
adventure
i
stepped
into
the
highway
and
went
with
him
into
mother
jane
cottage
had
i
been
favored
with
any
other
companion
than
himself
i
should
have
been
glad
of
this
opportunity
as
it
was
i
found
myself
ignoring
any
possible
danger
i
might
be
running
in
my
interest
in
the
remarkable
interior
to
which
i
was
thus
introduced
having
been
told
that
mother
jane
was
poor
i
had
expected
to
confront
squalor
and
possibly
filth
but
i
never
have
entered
a
cleaner
place
or
one
in
which
order
made
the
poorest
belongings
look
more
decent
the
four
walls
were
unfinished
and
so
were
the
rafters
which
formed
the
ceiling
but
the
floor
neatly
laid
in
brick
was
spotless
and
the
fireplace
also
of
brick
was
as
deftly
swept
as
one
could
expect
from
the
little
scrub
i
saw
hanging
by
its
side
crouched
within
this
fireplace
sat
the
old
woman
we
had
come
to
interview
her
back
was
to
us
and
she
looked
helplessly
and
hopelessly
deaf
ask
her
said
william
pointing
towards
her
with
a
rude
gesture
if
she
will
come
to
the
house
at
sunset
my
sisters
have
some
work
for
her
to
do
they
will
pay
her
well
advancing
at
his
bidding
i
passed
a
in
the
cushion
of
which
a
dozen
patches
met
my
eye
this
drew
my
eyes
toward
a
bed
over
which
a
counterpane
was
drawn
made
up
of
a
thousand
or
more
pieces
of
colored
calico
and
noticing
their
varied
shapes
and
the
intricacy
with
which
they
were
put
together
i
wondered
whether
she
ever
counted
them
the
next
moment
i
was
at
her
back
seventy
burst
from
her
lips
as
i
leaned
over
her
shoulder
and
showed
her
the
coin
which
i
had
taken
pains
to
have
in
my
hand
yours
i
announced
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
house
if
you
will
do
some
work
for
miss
knollys
slowly
she
shook
her
head
before
burying
it
deeper
in
the
shawl
she
wore
wrapped
about
her
shoulders
listening
a
minute
i
thought
i
heard
her
mutter
ten
but
no
more
i
can
count
no
more
go
away
but
i
nothing
if
not
persistent
feeling
for
her
hands
which
were
hidden
away
somewhere
under
her
shawl
i
touched
them
with
the
coin
and
cried
again
this
and
more
for
a
small
piece
of
work
come
you
are
strong
earn
it
what
kind
of
work
is
it
i
asked
innocently
or
it
must
have
appeared
innocently
of
knollys
who
was
standing
at
my
back
he
frowned
all
the
black
devils
in
his
heart
coming
into
his
look
at
once
how
do
i
know
ask
loreen
she
the
one
who
sent
me
i
do
take
account
of
what
goes
on
in
the
kitchen
i
begged
his
pardon
somewhat
sarcastically
i
own
and
made
another
attempt
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
old
crone
who
had
remained
perfectly
callous
to
my
allurements
i
thought
you
liked
money
i
said
for
lizzie
you
know
for
lizzie
but
she
only
muttered
in
lower
and
lower
gutturals
i
can
count
no
more
and
disgusted
at
my
failure
being
one
who
accounts
failure
as
little
short
of
disgrace
i
drew
back
and
made
my
way
toward
the
door
saying
she
in
a
different
mood
from
what
she
was
yesterday
when
she
snatched
a
quarter
from
me
at
the
first
intimation
it
was
hers
i
think
you
can
get
her
to
do
any
work
innocents
take
these
freaks
is
there
some
one
else
you
can
call
in
the
scowl
that
disfigured
his
none
too
handsome
features
was
a
fitting
prelude
to
his
words
you
talk
said
he
as
if
we
had
the
whole
village
at
our
command
how
did
you
succeed
with
the
locksmith
yesterday
came
did
he
well
that
what
we
have
to
expect
whenever
we
want
any
help
whirling
on
his
heel
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
hut
whither
i
would
have
immediately
followed
him
if
i
had
not
stopped
to
take
another
look
at
the
room
which
struck
me
even
upon
a
second
scrutiny
as
one
of
the
best
ordered
and
best
kept
i
had
ever
entered
even
the
strings
and
strings
of
dried
fruits
and
vegetables
which
hung
in
festoons
from
every
beam
of
the
roof
were
free
from
dust
and
cobwebs
and
though
the
dishes
were
few
and
the
pans
scarce
they
were
bright
and
speckless
giving
to
the
shelf
along
which
they
were
ranged
a
semblance
of
ornament
wise
enough
to
keep
her
house
in
order
thought
i
and
actually
found
it
hard
to
leave
so
attractive
to
my
eyes
are
absolute
neatness
and
order
william
was
pushing
at
his
own
gate
when
i
joined
him
he
looked
as
if
he
wished
i
had
spent
the
morning
with
mother
jane
and
was
barely
civil
in
our
walk
up
to
the
house
i
was
not
therefore
surprised
when
he
burst
into
a
volley
of
oaths
at
the
doorway
and
turned
upon
me
almost
as
if
he
would
forbid
me
the
house
for
tap
tap
tap
from
some
distant
quarter
came
a
distinct
sound
like
that
of
nails
being
driven
into
a
plank
xxii
the
third
night
mother
jane
must
have
changed
her
mind
after
we
left
her
for
late
in
the
evening
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
burly
figure
in
the
kitchen
as
i
went
to
give
hannah
some
instructions
concerning
certain
little
changes
in
the
housekeeping
arrangements
which
the
girls
and
i
had
agreed
were
necessary
to
our
mutual
comfort
i
wished
to
address
the
old
crone
but
warned
by
the
defiance
with
which
hannah
met
my
advances
that
any
such
attempt
on
my
part
would
be
met
by
anything
but
her
accustomed
i
refrained
from
showing
my
interest
in
her
strange
visitor
or
from
even
appearing
conscious
of
her
own
secret
anxieties
and
evident
preoccupation
loreen
and
lucetta
exchanged
a
meaning
look
as
i
rejoined
them
in
the
but
my
volubility
in
regard
to
the
domestic
affair
which
had
just
taken
me
to
the
kitchen
seemed
to
speedily
reassure
them
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
i
said
and
prepared
to
leave
the
room
it
was
with
the
conviction
that
i
had
relieved
their
mind
at
the
expense
of
my
own
mother
jane
in
the
kitchen
at
this
late
hour
meant
business
what
that
business
was
i
seemed
to
know
only
too
well
i
had
formed
a
plan
for
the
night
which
required
some
courage
recalling
lucetta
expression
of
the
morning
that
i
might
expect
a
repetition
of
the
former
night
experiences
i
prepared
to
profit
by
the
warning
in
a
way
she
little
meant
satisfied
that
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
suspicions
i
had
formed
there
would
be
an
act
performed
in
this
house
which
if
seen
by
me
would
forever
settle
the
question
agitating
the
whole
countryside
i
made
up
my
mind
that
no
locked
door
should
interfere
with
my
opportunity
of
doing
so
how
i
effected
this
result
i
will
presently
relate
lucetta
had
accompanied
me
to
my
door
with
a
lighted
candle
i
hear
you
had
some
trouble
with
matches
last
night
said
she
you
will
find
them
all
right
now
hannah
must
be
blamed
for
some
of
this
carelessness
then
as
i
began
some
reassuring
reply
she
turned
upon
me
with
a
look
that
was
almost
fond
and
throwing
out
her
arms
cried
entreatingly
wo
you
give
me
a
little
kiss
miss
butterworth
we
have
not
given
you
the
best
of
welcomes
but
you
are
my
mother
old
friend
and
sometimes
i
feel
a
little
lonely
i
could
easily
believe
that
and
yet
i
found
it
hard
to
embrace
her
too
many
shadows
swam
between
althea
children
and
myself
she
saw
my
hesitancy
a
hesitancy
i
could
not
but
have
shown
even
at
the
risk
of
losing
her
confidence
and
paling
slightly
dropped
her
hands
with
a
pitiful
smile
you
do
like
me
she
said
i
do
not
wonder
but
i
was
in
hopes
you
would
for
my
mother
sake
i
have
no
claims
myself
you
are
an
interesting
girl
and
you
have
what
your
mother
had
not
a
serious
side
to
your
nature
that
is
anything
but
displeasing
to
me
but
my
kisses
lucetta
are
as
rare
as
my
tears
i
had
rather
give
you
good
advice
and
that
is
a
fact
perhaps
it
is
as
strong
a
proof
of
affection
as
any
ordinary
caress
would
be
perhaps
she
assented
but
she
did
not
encourage
me
to
give
it
to
her
notwithstanding
instead
of
that
she
drew
back
and
bade
me
a
gentle
which
for
some
reason
made
me
sadder
than
i
wished
to
be
at
a
crisis
demanding
so
much
nerve
then
she
walked
quickly
away
and
i
was
left
to
face
the
night
alone
knowing
that
i
should
be
rather
weakened
than
helped
by
the
omission
of
any
of
the
little
acts
of
preparation
with
which
i
am
accustomed
to
calm
my
spirits
for
the
night
i
went
through
them
all
with
just
as
much
precision
as
if
i
had
expected
to
spend
the
ensuing
hours
in
rest
when
all
was
done
and
only
my
cup
of
tea
remained
to
be
quaffed
i
had
a
little
struggle
with
myself
which
ended
in
my
not
drinking
it
at
all
nothing
not
even
this
comfortable
solace
for
an
unsatisfactory
day
should
stand
in
the
way
of
my
being
the
complete
mistress
of
my
wits
this
night
had
i
known
that
this
tea
contained
a
soporific
in
the
shape
of
a
little
harmless
morphine
i
would
have
found
this
act
of
much
easier
it
was
now
eleven
confident
that
nothing
would
be
done
while
my
light
was
burning
i
blew
it
out
and
taking
a
candle
and
some
matches
in
my
hand
softly
opened
my
door
and
after
a
moment
of
intense
listening
stepped
out
and
closed
it
carefully
behind
me
nothing
could
be
stiller
than
the
house
or
darker
than
the
corridor
am
i
watched
or
am
i
not
watched
i
queried
and
for
an
instant
stood
undecided
then
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
i
slipped
down
the
hall
to
the
door
beyond
mine
and
opening
it
with
all
the
care
possible
stepped
inside
i
knew
the
room
i
had
taken
especial
note
of
it
in
my
visit
of
the
morning
i
knew
that
it
was
nearly
empty
and
that
there
was
a
key
in
the
lock
which
i
could
turn
i
therefore
felt
more
or
less
safe
in
it
especially
as
its
window
was
undarkened
by
the
branches
that
hung
so
thickly
across
my
own
casement
shutting
me
in
or
seeming
to
shut
me
in
from
all
communication
with
the
outside
world
and
the
unknown
guardian
which
i
had
been
assured
constantly
attended
my
summons
that
i
might
strengthen
my
spirits
by
one
glimpse
of
this
same
outside
world
before
settling
down
for
the
watch
i
had
set
for
myself
i
stepped
softly
to
the
window
and
took
one
lingering
look
without
a
belt
of
forest
illumined
by
a
gibbous
moon
met
my
eyes
nothing
else
yet
this
sight
was
welcome
and
it
was
only
after
i
had
been
struck
by
the
possibility
of
my
own
figure
being
seen
at
the
casement
by
some
possible
watcher
in
the
shadows
below
that
i
found
the
hardihood
necessary
to
withdraw
into
the
darker
precincts
of
the
room
and
begin
that
lonely
watch
which
my
doubts
and
expectations
rendered
necessary
this
was
the
third
i
had
been
forced
to
keep
and
it
was
by
far
the
most
dismal
for
though
the
bolted
door
between
me
and
the
hall
promised
me
personal
safety
there
presently
rose
in
some
place
a
smothered
repetition
of
that
same
tap
tap
tap
which
had
sent
the
shudders
over
me
upon
my
sudden
entrance
into
the
house
early
in
the
morning
heard
now
it
caused
me
to
tremble
in
a
way
i
had
not
supposed
possible
to
one
of
my
hardy
nature
and
while
with
this
recognition
of
my
feminine
susceptibility
to
impressions
there
came
a
certain
pride
in
the
stanchness
of
purpose
which
led
me
to
restrain
all
acknowledgment
of
fear
by
any
recourse
to
my
whistle
i
was
more
than
glad
when
even
this
sound
ceased
and
i
had
only
to
expect
the
swishing
noise
of
a
skirt
down
the
hall
and
that
stealthy
locking
of
the
door
of
the
room
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
leaving
it
came
sooner
than
i
expected
came
just
in
the
way
it
had
previously
done
only
that
the
person
paused
a
moment
to
listen
before
hastening
back
the
silence
within
must
have
satisfied
her
for
i
heard
a
low
sigh
like
that
of
relief
before
the
steps
took
themselves
back
that
they
would
turn
my
way
gave
me
a
momentary
concern
but
i
had
too
completely
lulled
my
young
hostesses
suspicions
or
let
me
be
faithful
to
all
the
possibilities
of
the
case
they
had
put
too
much
confidence
in
the
powder
with
which
they
had
seasoned
my
nightly
cup
of
tea
for
them
to
doubt
that
i
was
soundly
asleep
in
my
own
quarters
three
minutes
later
i
followed
those
steps
as
far
down
the
corridor
as
i
dared
to
go
for
since
my
last
appearance
in
it
a
candle
had
been
lit
in
the
main
hall
and
faint
as
was
its
glimmer
it
was
still
a
glimmer
into
the
circle
of
which
i
felt
it
would
be
foolhardiness
for
me
to
step
at
some
twenty
paces
then
from
the
opening
i
paused
and
gave
myself
up
to
listening
alas
there
was
plenty
now
for
me
to
hear
you
have
heard
the
sound
we
all
have
heard
the
sound
but
few
of
us
in
such
a
desolate
structure
and
at
the
hour
and
under
the
influences
of
midnight
the
measured
tread
of
men
struggling
under
a
heavy
weight
and
that
weight
how
well
i
knew
it
as
well
as
if
i
had
seen
it
as
i
really
did
in
my
imagination
they
advanced
from
the
adjoining
corridor
from
the
room
i
had
as
yet
found
no
opportunity
of
entering
and
they
approached
surely
and
slowly
the
main
hall
near
which
i
was
standing
in
such
a
position
as
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
see
anything
if
they
took
the
direct
course
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
so
down
as
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
they
would
i
did
not
dare
to
draw
nearer
however
so
concentrated
my
faculties
anew
upon
listening
when
suddenly
i
perceived
on
the
great
white
wall
in
front
of
me
the
wall
of
the
main
hall
i
mean
toward
which
the
opening
looked
the
shapeless
outline
of
a
drooping
head
and
realized
that
the
candle
had
been
placed
in
such
a
position
that
the
wall
must
receive
the
full
shadow
of
the
passing
cortège
and
thus
it
was
i
saw
it
huge
distorted
and
suggestive
beyond
any
picture
i
ever
beheld
the
passing
of
a
body
to
its
long
home
carried
by
six
anxious
figures
four
of
which
seemed
to
be
those
of
women
but
that
long
home
where
was
it
located
in
the
house
or
in
the
grounds
it
was
a
question
so
important
that
for
a
moment
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
i
could
follow
the
small
procession
without
running
the
risk
of
discovery
it
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
by
this
time
and
i
heard
miss
knollys
low
firm
voice
enjoining
silence
then
the
six
bearers
began
to
descend
with
their
burden
ere
they
reached
the
foot
a
doubt
struck
me
would
it
be
better
to
follow
them
or
to
take
the
opportunity
afforded
by
every
member
of
the
household
being
engaged
in
this
task
to
take
a
peep
into
the
room
where
the
death
had
occurred
i
had
not
decided
when
i
heard
them
take
the
forward
course
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
what
to
my
straining
ear
seemed
to
be
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
but
as
in
my
anxiety
to
determine
this
fact
i
slipped
far
enough
forward
to
make
sure
that
their
destination
lay
somewhere
within
reach
of
the
flower
parlor
i
was
so
struck
by
the
advantages
to
be
gained
by
a
cautious
use
of
the
in
william
room
that
i
hesitated
no
longer
but
sped
with
what
swiftness
i
could
toward
the
spot
from
which
i
had
so
lately
heard
this
strange
procession
advance
a
narrow
band
of
light
lying
across
the
upper
end
of
the
long
corridor
proved
that
the
door
was
not
only
ajar
but
that
a
second
candle
was
burning
in
the
room
i
was
about
to
invade
but
this
was
scarcely
to
be
regretted
since
there
could
be
no
question
of
the
emptiness
of
the
room
the
six
figures
i
had
seen
go
by
embraced
every
one
who
by
any
possibility
could
be
considered
as
having
part
in
this
transaction
william
simsbury
miss
knollys
lucetta
hannah
and
mother
jane
no
one
else
was
left
to
guard
this
room
so
i
pushed
the
door
open
quite
boldly
and
entered
what
i
saw
there
i
will
relate
later
or
rather
i
will
but
hint
at
now
a
bed
with
a
sheet
thrown
back
a
stand
covered
with
vials
a
bureau
with
a
man
shaving
paraphernalia
upon
it
and
on
the
wall
such
pictures
as
only
sporting
gentlemen
delight
in
the
candle
was
guttering
on
a
small
table
upon
which
to
my
astonishment
a
bible
lay
open
not
having
my
glasses
with
me
i
could
not
see
what
portion
of
the
sacred
word
was
thus
disclosed
but
i
took
the
precaution
to
indent
the
upper
leaf
with
my
so
that
i
might
find
it
again
in
case
of
future
opportunity
my
attention
was
attracted
by
other
small
matters
that
would
be
food
for
thought
at
a
more
propitious
moment
but
at
that
instant
the
sound
of
voices
coming
distinctly
to
my
ear
from
below
warned
me
that
a
halt
had
been
made
at
the
flower
parlor
and
that
the
duty
of
the
moment
was
to
locate
the
and
if
possible
determine
the
means
of
raising
it
this
was
less
difficult
than
i
anticipated
either
this
room
was
regarded
as
so
safe
from
intrusion
that
a
secret
like
this
could
be
safely
left
unguarded
or
the
door
which
was
plainly
to
be
seen
in
one
corner
had
been
so
lately
lifted
that
it
had
hardly
sunk
back
into
its
place
i
found
it
if
the
expression
may
be
used
of
a
horizontal
object
slightly
ajar
and
needing
but
the
slightest
pull
to
make
it
spring
upright
the
hole
thus
disclosed
was
filled
with
the
little
staircase
up
which
i
had
partly
mounted
in
my
daring
explorations
of
the
day
before
it
was
dark
now
darker
than
it
was
then
but
i
felt
that
i
must
descend
by
it
for
plainly
to
be
heard
now
through
the
crack
in
the
closet
door
which
seemed
to
have
a
knack
of
standing
partly
open
i
could
hear
the
heavy
tread
of
the
six
bearers
as
they
entered
the
parlor
below
still
carrying
their
burden
concerning
the
destination
of
which
i
was
so
anxious
to
be
informed
that
it
could
be
in
the
room
itself
was
too
improbable
for
consideration
yet
if
they
took
up
their
stand
in
this
room
it
was
for
a
purpose
and
what
that
purpose
was
i
was
determined
to
know
the
noise
their
feet
made
on
the
bare
boards
of
the
floor
and
the
few
words
i
now
heard
uttered
in
william
stolid
tones
and
lucetta
musical
treble
assured
me
that
my
own
light
steps
would
no
more
be
heard
than
my
dark
gown
of
quiet
wool
would
be
seen
through
the
narrow
slit
through
which
i
was
preparing
to
peer
yet
it
took
no
small
degree
of
what
my
father
used
to
call
pluck
for
me
to
put
foot
on
this
winding
staircase
and
descend
almost
as
it
were
into
the
midst
of
what
i
must
regard
as
the
last
wicked
act
of
a
most
cowardly
and
brutal
murder
i
did
it
however
and
after
a
short
but
grim
communion
with
my
own
heart
which
would
persist
in
beating
somewhat
noisily
i
leaned
forward
with
all
the
precaution
possible
and
let
my
gaze
traverse
the
chamber
in
which
i
had
previously
seen
such
horrors
as
should
have
prepared
me
for
this
last
and
greatest
one
in
a
moment
i
understood
the
whole
a
long
square
hole
in
the
floor
lately
sawed
provided
an
opening
through
which
the
plain
plank
coffin
of
which
i
now
caught
sight
was
to
be
lowered
into
the
cellar
and
so
into
the
grave
which
had
doubtless
been
dug
there
the
ropes
in
the
hands
of
the
six
persons
in
whose
identity
i
had
made
no
mistake
was
proof
enough
of
their
intention
and
satisfied
as
i
now
was
of
the
means
and
mode
of
the
interment
which
had
been
such
a
boundless
mystery
to
me
i
shrank
a
step
upward
fearing
lest
my
indignation
and
the
horror
i
could
not
but
feel
from
this
moment
on
of
althea
children
would
betray
me
into
some
exclamation
which
might
lead
to
my
discovery
and
a
similar
fate
one
other
short
glance
in
which
i
saw
them
all
ranged
around
the
dark
opening
and
i
was
up
out
of
their
reach
lucetta
face
and
one
sob
as
the
ropes
began
to
creak
being
the
one
memory
which
followed
me
the
most
persistently
she
at
least
was
overwhelmed
with
remorse
for
a
deed
she
was
perhaps
only
answerable
for
in
that
she
failed
to
make
known
to
the
world
her
brother
madness
and
the
horrible
crimes
to
which
it
gave
rise
i
took
one
other
look
around
his
room
before
i
fled
to
my
own
or
rather
to
the
one
in
which
i
had
taken
refuge
while
my
own
was
under
lock
and
key
that
i
spent
the
next
two
hours
on
my
knees
no
one
can
wonder
when
my
own
room
was
unlocked
as
it
was
before
the
day
broke
i
hastened
to
enter
it
and
lay
my
head
with
all
its
unhappy
knowledge
on
my
pillow
but
i
did
not
sleep
and
what
was
stranger
still
never
once
thought
of
sounding
a
single
note
on
the
whistle
which
would
have
brought
the
police
into
this
abode
of
crime
perhaps
it
was
a
wise
omission
i
had
seen
enough
that
was
horrible
that
night
without
beholding
althea
children
arrested
before
my
eyes
forward
and
back
xxiii
room
hotel
carter
i
rose
at
my
usual
hour
i
dressed
myself
with
my
usual
care
i
was
to
a
superficial
observer
at
least
in
all
respects
my
usual
self
when
hannah
came
to
my
door
to
ask
what
she
could
do
for
me
as
there
was
nothing
i
wanted
but
to
get
out
of
this
house
which
had
become
unbearable
to
me
i
replied
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
that
my
wants
were
all
supplied
and
that
i
would
soon
be
down
at
which
she
answered
that
in
that
case
she
must
bestir
herself
or
the
breakfast
would
not
be
ready
and
hurried
away
there
was
no
one
in
the
when
i
entered
and
judging
from
appearances
that
several
minutes
must
elapse
before
breakfast
would
be
ready
i
took
occasion
to
stroll
through
the
grounds
and
glance
up
at
the
window
of
william
room
the
knot
of
crape
was
gone
i
would
have
gone
farther
but
just
then
i
heard
a
great
rushing
and
scampering
and
looking
up
saw
an
enormous
dog
approaching
at
full
gallop
from
the
stables
saracen
was
loose
i
did
not
scream
or
give
way
to
other
feminine
expressions
of
fear
but
i
did
return
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
house
where
i
now
saw
i
must
remain
till
william
chose
to
take
me
into
town
this
i
was
determined
should
take
place
as
soon
after
breakfast
as
practicable
the
knowledge
which
i
now
possessed
warranted
nay
demanded
instant
consultation
with
the
police
and
as
this
could
best
be
effected
by
following
out
the
orders
i
had
received
from
gryce
i
did
not
consider
any
other
plan
than
that
of
meeting
the
man
on
duty
in
room
no
at
the
hotel
loreen
lucetta
and
william
were
awaiting
me
in
the
hall
and
made
no
apology
for
the
flurry
into
which
i
had
been
thrown
by
my
rapid
escape
from
saracen
indeed
i
doubt
if
they
noticed
it
for
with
all
the
attempt
they
made
to
seem
gay
and
at
ease
the
anxieties
and
fatigue
of
the
foregoing
nights
were
telling
upon
them
and
from
miss
knollys
down
they
looked
physically
exhausted
but
they
also
looked
mentally
relieved
in
the
clear
depths
of
lucetta
eye
there
was
now
no
wavering
and
the
head
which
was
always
turning
in
anxious
anticipation
over
her
shoulder
rested
firm
though
not
as
erect
as
her
sister
who
had
less
cause
perhaps
for
regret
and
sorrow
william
was
joyful
to
a
degree
but
it
was
a
forced
joviality
which
only
became
real
when
he
heard
a
sudden
quick
bark
under
the
window
and
the
sound
of
scraping
paws
against
the
mastic
coating
of
the
wall
outside
then
he
broke
out
into
a
loud
laugh
of
unrestrained
pleasure
crying
out
thoughtlessly
there
saracen
how
quick
he
knows
a
warning
look
from
lucetta
stopped
him
i
mean
he
stammered
it
a
dull
dog
that
can
not
find
his
master
miss
butterworth
you
will
have
to
overcome
your
fear
of
dogs
if
you
stay
with
us
long
saracen
is
unbound
this
morning
and
he
used
a
great
oath
he
going
to
remain
so
by
which
i
came
to
understand
that
it
was
not
out
of
consideration
for
me
he
had
been
tied
up
in
the
court
till
now
but
for
reasons
connected
with
their
own
safety
and
the
preservation
of
the
secret
which
they
so
evidently
believed
had
been
buried
with
the
body
which
i
did
not
like
to
remember
lay
at
that
very
minute
too
nearly
under
our
feet
for
my
own
individual
comfort
however
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reply
i
made
to
william
i
hope
he
does
not
run
with
the
buggy
i
objected
i
want
to
take
a
ride
very
much
this
morning
and
could
get
small
pleasure
out
of
it
if
that
dog
must
be
our
companion
i
can
not
go
out
this
morning
william
began
but
changed
his
sentence
possibly
at
the
touch
of
his
sister
foot
under
the
table
into
but
if
you
say
i
must
why
i
must
you
women
folks
are
so
plagued
unreasonable
had
he
been
ten
years
younger
i
would
have
boxed
his
ears
had
he
been
that
much
older
i
would
have
taken
cue
and
packed
my
trunk
before
he
could
have
finished
the
cup
of
coffee
he
was
drinking
but
he
was
just
too
old
to
reprimand
in
the
way
just
mentioned
and
not
old
enough
to
appreciate
any
display
of
personal
dignity
or
on
the
part
of
the
person
he
had
offended
besides
he
was
a
knave
so
i
just
let
his
impertinence
pass
with
the
remark
i
have
purchases
to
make
in
the
village
and
so
that
matter
ended
manifestly
to
the
two
girls
relief
who
naturally
did
not
like
to
see
me
insulted
even
if
they
did
not
possess
sufficient
power
over
their
brother
to
prevent
it
one
other
small
episode
and
then
i
will
take
you
with
me
to
the
village
as
we
were
leaving
the
table
where
i
ate
less
than
common
notwithstanding
all
my
efforts
to
seem
perfectly
unconcerned
lucetta
who
had
waited
for
her
brother
to
go
out
took
me
gently
by
the
arm
and
eying
me
closely
said
did
you
have
any
dreams
last
night
miss
butterworth
you
know
i
promised
you
some
the
question
disconcerted
me
and
for
a
moment
i
felt
like
taking
the
two
girls
into
my
confidence
and
bidding
them
fly
from
the
shame
and
doom
so
soon
to
fall
upon
their
brother
but
the
real
principle
underlying
all
such
momentary
impulses
on
my
part
deterred
me
and
in
as
light
a
tone
as
i
could
command
and
not
be
an
absolute
hypocrite
i
replied
that
i
was
sorry
to
disappoint
her
but
i
had
had
no
dreams
which
seemed
to
please
her
more
than
it
should
for
if
i
had
had
no
dreams
i
certainly
had
suffered
from
the
most
frightful
realities
i
will
not
describe
our
ride
into
town
saracen
did
go
with
us
and
indignation
not
only
rendered
me
speechless
but
gave
to
my
thoughts
a
turn
which
made
that
of
very
little
value
to
me
mother
burly
figure
crouching
in
her
doorway
might
otherwise
have
given
me
opportunity
for
remark
and
so
might
the
dubious
looks
of
people
we
met
on
the
highroad
looks
to
which
i
am
so
wholly
unaccustomed
that
i
had
difficulty
in
recognizing
myself
as
the
butt
of
so
much
doubt
and
possibly
dislike
i
attributed
this
however
all
to
the
ill
repute
under
which
william
so
deservedly
labored
and
did
not
allow
myself
to
more
than
notice
it
indeed
i
could
only
be
sorry
for
people
who
did
not
know
in
what
consideration
i
was
held
at
home
and
who
either
through
ignorance
or
prejudice
allowed
themselves
privileges
they
would
be
the
first
to
regret
did
they
know
the
heart
and
mind
of
amelia
butterworth
once
in
the
village
i
took
the
direction
of
affairs
set
me
down
at
the
hotel
i
commanded
and
then
go
about
such
business
as
you
may
have
here
in
town
i
am
not
going
to
allow
myself
to
be
tracked
all
over
by
that
dog
i
have
no
business
was
the
surly
reply
then
make
some
was
my
sharp
retort
i
want
to
see
the
locksmith
that
locksmith
who
would
come
to
do
an
honest
piece
of
work
for
me
in
your
house
and
i
want
to
buy
dimities
and
wools
and
sewing
silks
at
the
store
over
there
indeed
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
do
and
expect
to
spend
half
the
morning
before
the
counters
why
man
i
have
done
any
shopping
for
a
week
he
gaped
at
me
perfectly
aghast
as
i
meant
he
should
and
having
but
little
experience
of
city
ladies
took
me
at
my
word
and
prepared
to
beat
an
honorable
retreat
as
a
result
i
found
myself
ten
minutes
later
standing
on
the
top
step
of
the
hotel
porch
watching
william
driving
away
with
saracen
perched
on
the
seat
beside
him
then
i
realized
that
the
village
held
no
companions
for
him
and
did
not
know
whether
i
felt
glad
or
sorry
to
the
clerk
who
came
to
meet
me
i
said
quietly
room
no
if
you
please
at
which
he
gave
a
nod
of
intelligence
and
led
me
as
unostentatiously
as
possible
into
a
small
hall
at
the
end
of
which
i
saw
a
door
with
the
aforesaid
number
on
it
if
you
will
take
a
seat
inside
said
he
i
will
send
you
whatever
you
may
desire
for
your
comfort
i
think
you
know
what
that
is
i
rejoined
at
which
he
nodded
again
and
left
me
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
as
he
went
the
few
minutes
which
elapsed
before
my
quiet
was
disturbed
were
spent
by
me
in
thinking
there
were
many
little
questions
to
settle
in
my
own
mind
for
which
a
spell
of
uninterrupted
contemplation
was
necessary
one
of
these
was
whether
in
the
event
of
finding
the
police
amenable
i
should
reveal
or
hide
from
these
children
of
my
old
friend
the
fact
that
it
was
through
my
instrumentality
that
their
nefarious
secret
had
been
discovered
i
wished
nay
i
hoped
that
the
affair
might
be
so
concluded
but
the
possibility
of
doing
so
seemed
so
problematical
especially
since
gryce
was
not
on
hand
to
direct
matters
that
i
spent
very
little
time
on
the
subject
deep
and
important
as
it
was
to
all
concerned
what
most
occupied
me
was
the
necessity
of
telling
my
story
in
such
a
way
as
to
exonerate
the
girls
as
much
as
possible
they
were
mistaken
in
their
devotion
and
most
unhappy
in
the
exercise
of
it
but
they
were
not
innately
wicked
and
should
not
be
made
to
appear
so
perhaps
the
one
thing
for
which
i
should
yet
have
the
best
cause
to
congratulate
myself
would
be
the
opportunity
i
had
gained
of
giving
to
their
connection
with
this
affair
its
true
and
proper
coloring
i
was
still
dwelling
on
this
thought
when
there
came
a
knock
at
my
door
which
advised
me
that
the
visitor
i
expected
had
arrived
to
open
and
admit
him
was
the
work
of
a
moment
but
it
took
more
than
a
moment
for
me
to
overcome
my
surprise
at
seeing
in
my
visitor
no
lesser
person
than
gryce
himself
who
in
our
parting
interview
had
assured
me
he
was
too
old
and
too
feeble
for
further
detective
work
and
must
therefore
delegate
it
to
me
ah
i
ejaculated
slowly
it
is
you
is
it
well
i
am
not
surprised
i
should
have
been
when
you
say
you
are
old
you
mean
old
enough
to
pull
the
wool
over
other
people
eyes
and
when
you
say
you
are
lame
you
mean
that
you
only
halt
long
enough
to
let
others
get
far
enough
ahead
for
them
not
to
see
how
fast
you
hobble
up
behind
them
but
do
not
think
i
am
not
happy
to
see
you
i
am
gryce
for
i
have
discovered
the
secret
of
lost
man
lane
and
find
it
somewhat
too
heavy
a
one
for
my
own
handling
to
my
surprise
he
showed
this
was
more
than
he
expected
you
have
he
asked
with
just
that
shade
of
incredulity
which
it
is
so
tantalizing
to
encounter
then
i
suppose
congratulations
are
in
order
but
are
you
sure
miss
butterworth
that
you
really
have
obtained
a
clue
to
the
many
strange
and
fearful
disappearances
which
have
given
to
this
lane
its
name
quite
sure
i
returned
nettled
why
do
you
doubt
it
because
i
have
kept
so
quiet
and
not
sounded
one
note
of
alarm
from
my
whistle
no
said
he
knowing
your
so
well
i
can
not
say
that
that
is
my
reason
what
is
it
then
i
urged
well
said
he
my
real
reason
for
doubting
if
you
have
been
quite
as
successful
as
you
think
is
that
we
ourselves
have
come
upon
a
clue
about
which
there
can
be
no
question
can
you
say
the
same
of
yours
you
will
expect
my
answer
to
have
been
a
decided
yes
uttered
with
all
the
positiveness
of
which
you
know
me
capable
but
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
of
the
strange
influence
this
man
personality
exercises
upon
all
yes
all
who
do
not
absolutely
steel
themselves
against
him
i
faltered
just
long
enough
for
him
to
cry
i
thought
not
the
clue
is
outside
the
knollys
house
not
in
it
miss
butterworth
for
which
of
course
you
are
not
to
be
blamed
or
your
services
scorned
i
have
no
doubt
they
have
been
invaluable
in
unearthing
secret
if
not
secret
thank
you
was
my
quiet
retort
i
thought
his
presumption
beyond
all
bounds
and
would
at
that
moment
have
felt
justified
in
snapping
my
fingers
at
the
clue
he
boasted
of
had
it
not
been
for
one
thing
what
that
thing
is
i
am
not
ready
yet
to
state
you
and
i
have
come
to
issue
over
such
matters
before
said
he
and
therefore
need
not
take
too
much
account
of
the
feelings
it
is
likely
to
engender
i
will
merely
state
that
my
clue
points
to
mother
jane
and
ask
if
you
have
found
in
the
visit
she
paid
at
the
house
last
night
anything
which
would
go
to
strengthen
the
suspicion
against
her
perhaps
said
i
in
a
state
of
disdain
that
was
more
or
less
unpardonable
considering
that
my
own
suspicions
previous
to
my
discovery
of
the
real
tragedy
enacted
under
my
eyes
at
the
knollys
mansion
had
played
more
or
less
about
this
old
crone
only
perhaps
he
smiled
with
a
playful
forbearance
for
which
i
should
have
been
truly
grateful
to
him
she
was
there
for
no
good
purpose
said
i
and
yet
if
you
had
not
characterized
her
as
the
person
most
responsible
for
the
crimes
we
are
here
to
investigate
i
should
have
said
from
all
that
i
then
saw
of
her
conduct
that
she
acted
as
a
supernumerary
rather
than
principal
and
that
it
is
to
me
you
should
look
for
the
correct
clue
to
the
criminal
notwithstanding
your
confidence
in
your
own
theories
and
my
momentary
hesitation
to
assert
that
there
was
no
possible
defect
in
mine
miss
butterworth
i
thought
he
looked
a
trifle
shaken
what
did
mother
jane
do
in
that
closely
shuttered
house
last
night
mother
jane
well
did
he
think
i
was
going
to
introduce
my
tragic
story
by
telling
what
mother
jane
did
i
must
have
looked
irritated
and
indeed
i
think
i
had
cause
mother
jane
ate
her
supper
i
snapped
out
angrily
miss
knollys
gave
it
to
her
then
she
helped
a
little
with
a
piece
of
work
they
had
on
hand
it
will
not
interest
you
to
know
what
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
clue
i
warrant
he
did
not
get
angry
he
has
an
admirable
temper
has
gryce
but
he
did
stop
a
minute
to
consider
miss
butterworth
he
said
at
last
most
detectives
would
have
held
their
peace
and
let
you
go
on
with
what
you
have
to
tell
without
a
hint
that
it
was
either
unwelcome
or
unnecessary
but
i
have
consideration
for
persons
feelings
and
for
persons
secrets
so
long
as
they
do
not
come
in
collision
with
the
law
and
my
opinion
is
or
was
when
i
entered
this
room
that
such
discoveries
as
you
have
made
at
your
old
house
why
need
he
emphasize
friend
did
he
think
i
forgot
for
a
moment
that
althea
was
my
friend
were
connected
rather
with
some
family
difficulty
than
with
the
dreadful
affair
we
are
considering
that
is
why
i
hastened
to
tell
you
that
we
had
found
a
clue
to
the
disappearances
in
mother
jane
cottage
i
wished
to
save
the
misses
knollys
if
he
had
thought
to
mollify
me
by
this
assertion
he
did
not
succeed
he
saw
it
and
made
haste
to
say
not
that
i
doubt
your
consideration
for
them
only
the
justness
of
your
conclusions
you
have
doubted
those
before
and
with
more
reason
i
replied
yet
they
were
not
altogether
false
that
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
so
willing
that
if
you
still
think
after
i
have
told
my
story
that
yours
is
then
i
will
listen
to
it
only
too
eagerly
my
object
is
to
find
the
real
criminal
in
this
matter
i
say
at
the
present
moment
it
is
mother
jane
god
grant
you
are
right
i
said
influenced
in
spite
of
myself
by
the
calm
assurance
of
his
manner
if
she
was
at
the
house
night
before
last
between
eleven
and
twelve
then
perhaps
she
is
all
you
think
her
but
i
see
no
reason
to
believe
it
not
yet
gryce
supposing
you
give
me
one
it
would
be
better
than
all
this
controversy
one
small
reason
gryce
as
good
as
i
did
not
say
what
but
the
fillip
it
gave
to
his
intention
stood
me
in
good
stead
for
he
launched
immediately
into
the
matter
with
no
further
play
upon
my
curiosity
which
was
now
as
you
can
believe
thoroughly
aroused
though
i
could
not
believe
that
anything
he
had
to
bring
up
against
mother
jane
could
for
a
moment
stand
against
the
death
and
the
burial
i
had
witnessed
in
miss
knollys
house
during
the
two
previous
nights
xxiv
the
enigma
of
numbers
when
in
our
first
conversation
on
this
topic
i
told
you
that
mother
jane
was
not
to
be
considered
in
this
matter
i
meant
she
was
not
to
be
considered
by
you
she
was
a
subject
to
be
handled
by
the
police
and
we
have
handled
her
yesterday
afternoon
i
made
a
search
of
her
cabin
here
gryce
paused
and
eyed
me
quizzically
he
sometimes
does
eye
me
which
same
i
can
not
regard
as
a
compliment
considering
how
fond
he
is
of
concentrating
all
his
wisdom
upon
small
and
insignificant
objects
i
wonder
said
he
what
you
would
have
done
in
such
a
search
as
that
it
was
no
common
one
i
assure
you
there
are
not
many
between
mother
jane
four
walls
i
felt
myself
begin
to
tremble
with
eagerness
of
course
i
wish
i
had
been
given
the
opportunity
said
i
that
is
if
anything
was
to
be
found
there
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
sympathetic
mood
toward
me
or
perhaps
and
this
is
the
likelier
supposition
he
had
a
minute
of
leisure
and
thought
he
could
afford
to
give
himself
a
little
quiet
amusement
however
that
was
he
answered
me
by
saying
the
opportunity
is
not
lost
you
have
been
in
her
cabin
and
have
noted
i
have
no
doubt
its
extreme
simplicity
yet
it
contains
or
rather
did
contain
up
till
last
night
distinct
evidences
of
more
than
one
of
the
crimes
which
have
been
perpetrated
in
this
lane
good
and
you
want
me
to
guess
where
you
found
them
well
it
not
fair
ah
and
why
not
because
you
probably
did
not
find
them
on
your
first
attempt
you
had
time
to
look
about
i
am
asked
to
guess
at
once
and
without
second
trial
what
i
warrant
it
took
you
several
trials
to
determine
he
could
not
help
but
laugh
and
why
do
you
think
it
took
me
several
trials
because
there
is
more
than
one
thing
in
that
room
made
up
of
parts
parts
he
attempted
to
look
puzzled
but
i
would
not
have
it
you
know
what
i
mean
i
declared
seventy
parts
or
whatever
the
numbers
are
she
so
constantly
mutters
his
admiration
was
unqualified
and
sincere
miss
butterworth
said
he
you
are
a
woman
after
my
own
heart
how
came
you
to
think
that
her
mutterings
had
anything
to
do
with
a
because
it
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
amount
of
money
i
gave
her
when
i
handed
her
cents
she
cried
and
now
ten
ten
what
not
ten
cents
or
ten
dollars
but
ten
why
do
you
stop
i
do
not
want
to
risk
my
reputation
on
a
guess
there
is
a
quilt
on
the
bed
made
up
of
innumerable
pieces
there
is
a
floor
of
neatly
laid
brick
and
there
is
a
bible
on
the
stand
whose
leaves
number
many
over
seventy
ah
it
was
in
the
bible
you
found
his
smile
put
mine
quite
to
shame
i
must
acknowledge
he
cried
that
i
looked
in
the
bible
but
i
found
nothing
there
beyond
what
we
all
seek
when
we
open
its
sacred
covers
shall
i
tell
my
story
he
was
evidently
bursting
with
pride
you
would
think
that
after
a
of
just
such
successes
a
man
would
take
his
honors
more
quietly
but
pshaw
human
nature
is
just
the
same
in
the
old
as
in
the
young
he
was
no
more
tired
of
compliment
or
of
awakening
the
astonishment
of
those
he
confided
in
than
when
he
aroused
the
admiration
of
the
force
by
his
triumphant
handling
of
the
leavenworth
case
of
course
in
presence
of
such
weakness
i
could
do
nothing
less
than
give
him
a
sympathetic
ear
i
may
be
old
myself
some
day
besides
his
story
was
likely
to
prove
more
or
less
interesting
tell
your
story
i
repeated
do
you
see
that
i
am
i
was
going
to
say
on
pins
and
needles
till
i
hear
it
but
the
expression
is
too
vulgar
for
a
woman
of
my
breeding
so
i
altered
the
words
happily
before
they
were
spoken
into
that
i
am
in
a
state
of
the
liveliest
curiosity
concerning
the
whole
matter
tell
your
story
of
course
well
miss
butterworth
if
i
do
it
is
because
i
know
you
will
appreciate
it
you
like
myself
placed
weight
upon
the
numbers
she
is
forever
running
over
and
you
like
myself
have
conceived
the
possibility
of
these
numbers
having
reference
to
something
in
the
one
room
she
inhabits
at
first
glance
the
extreme
bareness
of
the
spot
seemed
to
promise
nothing
to
my
curiosity
i
looked
at
the
floor
and
detected
no
signs
of
any
disturbance
having
taken
place
in
its
symmetrically
laid
bricks
for
years
yet
i
counted
up
to
seventy
one
way
and
the
other
and
marking
the
brick
thus
selected
began
to
pry
it
out
it
came
with
difficulty
and
showed
me
nothing
underneath
but
green
mold
and
innumerable
frightened
insects
then
i
counted
the
bricks
the
other
way
but
nothing
came
of
it
the
floor
does
not
appear
to
have
been
disturbed
for
years
turning
my
attention
away
from
the
floor
i
began
upon
the
quilt
this
was
a
worse
job
than
the
other
and
it
took
me
an
hour
to
rip
apart
the
block
i
settled
upon
as
the
suspicious
one
but
my
labor
was
entirely
wasted
there
was
no
hidden
treasure
in
the
quilt
then
i
searched
the
walls
using
the
measurements
seventy
by
but
no
result
followed
these
endeavors
and
well
what
do
you
think
i
did
then
you
will
tell
me
i
said
if
i
give
you
one
more
minute
to
do
it
in
very
well
said
he
i
see
you
do
not
know
madam
having
searched
below
and
around
me
i
next
turned
my
attention
overhead
do
you
remember
the
strings
and
strings
of
dried
vegetables
that
decorate
the
beams
above
i
do
i
replied
not
stinting
any
of
the
astonishment
i
really
felt
well
i
began
to
count
them
next
and
when
i
reached
the
seventieth
onion
from
the
open
doorway
i
crushed
it
between
my
fingers
and
these
fell
out
madam
worthless
trinkets
as
you
will
immediately
see
but
well
well
i
urged
they
have
been
identified
as
belonging
to
the
peddler
who
was
one
of
the
victims
in
whose
fate
we
are
interested
ah
ah
i
ejaculated
somewhat
amazed
i
own
and
number
that
was
a
carrot
and
it
held
a
really
valuable
ring
a
ruby
surrounded
by
diamonds
if
you
remember
i
once
spoke
to
you
of
this
ring
it
was
the
property
of
young
chittenden
and
worn
by
him
while
he
was
in
this
village
he
disappeared
on
his
way
to
the
railway
station
having
taken
as
many
can
vouch
the
short
detour
by
lost
lane
which
would
lead
him
directly
by
mother
jane
cottage
you
thrill
me
said
i
keeping
down
with
admirable
my
own
thoughts
in
regard
to
this
matter
and
what
of
no
ten
beyond
which
she
said
she
could
not
count
in
ten
was
your
piece
and
in
various
other
vegetables
small
coins
whose
value
taken
collectively
would
not
amount
to
a
dollar
the
only
numbers
which
seemed
to
make
any
impression
on
her
mind
were
those
connected
with
these
crimes
very
good
evidence
miss
butterworth
that
mother
jane
holds
the
clue
to
this
matter
even
if
she
is
not
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
individuals
represented
by
this
property
certainly
i
acquiesced
and
if
you
examined
her
after
her
return
from
the
knollys
mansion
last
night
you
would
probably
have
found
upon
her
some
similar
evidence
of
her
complicity
in
the
last
crime
of
this
terrible
series
it
would
needs
have
been
small
as
silly
rufus
neither
indulged
in
the
brass
trinkets
sold
by
the
old
peddler
nor
the
real
jewelry
of
a
man
like
mr
chittenden
silly
rufus
he
was
the
last
to
disappear
from
these
parts
was
he
not
yes
madam
and
as
such
should
have
left
some
clue
to
his
fate
in
the
hands
of
this
old
crone
if
her
motive
in
removing
him
was
as
you
seem
to
think
entirely
that
of
gain
i
did
not
say
it
was
entirely
so
silly
rufus
would
be
the
last
person
any
one
even
such
a
compos
as
mother
jane
would
destroy
for
hope
of
gain
but
what
other
motive
could
she
have
and
gryce
where
could
she
bestow
the
bodies
of
so
many
unfortunate
victims
even
if
by
her
great
strength
she
could
succeed
in
killing
them
there
you
have
me
said
he
we
have
not
been
able
as
yet
to
unearth
any
bodies
have
you
no
said
i
with
some
little
show
of
triumph
showing
through
my
disdain
but
i
can
show
where
to
unearth
one
he
should
have
been
startled
profoundly
startled
why
was
he
i
asked
this
of
myself
over
and
over
in
the
one
instant
he
weighed
his
words
before
answering
you
have
made
some
definite
discoveries
then
he
declared
you
have
come
across
a
grave
or
a
mound
which
you
have
taken
for
a
grave
i
shook
my
head
no
mound
said
i
why
should
i
not
play
for
an
instant
or
more
with
his
curiosity
he
had
with
mine
ah
then
why
do
you
talk
of
unearthing
no
one
has
told
you
where
you
can
lay
hand
on
silly
rufus
body
i
take
it
no
said
i
the
knollys
house
is
not
inclined
to
give
up
its
secrets
he
started
glancing
almost
remorsefully
first
at
the
tip
then
at
the
head
of
the
cane
he
was
balancing
in
his
hand
it
too
bad
he
muttered
but
you
been
led
astray
miss
butterworth
excusably
i
acknowledge
quite
excusably
but
yet
in
a
way
to
give
you
quite
wrong
conclusions
the
secret
of
the
knollys
house
but
wait
a
moment
then
you
were
not
locked
up
in
your
room
last
night
scarcely
i
returned
wavering
between
the
doubts
he
had
awakened
by
his
first
sentence
and
the
surprise
which
his
last
could
not
fail
to
give
me
i
might
have
known
they
would
not
be
likely
to
catch
you
in
a
trap
he
remarked
so
you
were
up
and
in
the
halls
i
was
up
i
acknowledged
and
in
the
halls
may
i
ask
where
you
were
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
last
sentence
this
complicates
matters
said
he
and
yet
perhaps
it
is
as
well
i
understand
you
now
and
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
understand
me
you
thought
it
was
silly
rufus
who
was
buried
last
night
that
was
rather
an
awful
thought
miss
butterworth
i
wonder
with
that
in
your
mind
you
look
as
well
as
you
do
this
morning
madam
truly
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
a
very
wonderful
woman
a
truce
to
compliments
i
begged
if
you
know
as
much
as
your
words
imply
of
what
went
on
in
that
house
last
night
you
ought
to
show
some
degree
of
emotion
yourself
for
if
it
was
not
silly
rufus
who
was
laid
away
under
the
flower
parlor
who
then
was
it
no
one
for
whom
tears
could
openly
be
shed
or
of
whose
death
public
acknowledgment
could
be
made
or
we
would
not
be
sitting
here
talking
away
at
cross
purposes
the
morning
after
his
burial
tears
are
not
shed
or
public
acknowledgment
made
for
the
subject
of
a
man
love
for
scientific
investigation
it
was
no
human
being
whom
you
saw
buried
madam
but
a
victim
of
knollys
passion
for
vivisection
you
are
playing
with
me
was
my
indignant
answer
outrageously
and
inexcusably
playing
with
me
only
a
human
being
would
be
laid
away
in
such
secrecy
and
with
such
manifestations
of
feeling
as
i
was
witness
to
you
must
think
me
in
my
dotage
or
else
we
will
take
the
rest
of
the
sentence
for
granted
he
dryly
interpolated
you
know
that
i
can
have
no
wish
to
insult
your
intelligence
miss
butterworth
and
that
if
i
advance
a
theory
on
my
own
account
i
must
have
ample
reasons
for
it
now
can
you
say
the
same
for
yours
can
you
adduce
irrefutable
proof
that
the
body
we
buried
last
night
was
that
of
a
man
if
you
can
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
or
rather
there
is
everything
to
be
said
for
this
would
give
to
the
transaction
a
very
dreadful
and
tragic
significance
which
at
present
i
am
not
disposed
to
ascribe
to
it
taken
aback
by
his
persistence
but
determined
not
to
acknowledge
defeat
until
forced
to
it
i
stolidly
replied
you
have
made
an
assertion
and
it
is
for
you
to
adduce
proof
it
will
be
time
enough
for
me
to
talk
when
your
own
theory
is
proved
untenable
he
was
not
angry
for
my
disappointment
made
him
unusually
gentle
his
voice
was
therefore
very
kind
when
he
said
madam
if
you
know
it
to
have
been
a
man
say
so
i
do
not
wish
to
waste
my
time
i
do
not
know
it
very
well
then
i
will
tell
you
why
i
think
my
supposition
true
knollys
as
you
probably
have
already
discovered
is
a
man
with
a
secret
passion
for
vivisection
yes
i
have
discovered
that
it
is
known
to
his
family
and
it
is
known
to
a
very
few
others
but
it
is
not
known
to
the
world
at
large
not
even
to
his
i
can
believe
it
said
i
his
sisters
who
are
gentle
girls
regard
the
matter
as
the
usually
do
they
have
tried
in
every
way
to
influence
him
to
abandon
it
but
unsuccessfully
so
far
for
he
is
not
only
entirely
unamenable
to
persuasion
but
has
a
nature
of
such
brutality
he
could
not
live
without
some
such
excitement
to
help
away
his
life
in
this
dreary
house
all
they
can
do
then
is
to
conceal
these
cruelties
from
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
already
execrate
him
for
his
many
roughnesses
and
the
undoubted
shadow
under
which
he
lives
time
was
when
i
thought
this
shadow
had
a
substance
worth
our
investigation
but
a
further
knowledge
of
his
real
fault
and
a
completer
knowledge
of
his
virtues
turned
my
inquiries
in
a
new
direction
where
i
have
found
as
i
have
told
you
actual
reason
for
arresting
mother
jane
have
you
anything
to
say
against
these
conclusions
can
not
you
see
that
all
your
suspicions
can
be
explained
by
the
brother
cruel
impulses
and
the
sisters
horror
of
having
those
impulses
known
i
thought
a
moment
then
i
cried
out
boldly
no
i
can
not
gryce
the
anxiety
the
fear
which
i
have
seen
depicted
on
these
faces
for
days
might
be
explained
perhaps
by
this
theory
but
the
knot
of
crape
on
the
the
open
bible
in
the
room
of
death
william
room
gryce
proclaim
that
it
was
a
human
being
and
nothing
less
for
whom
lucetta
sobs
went
up
i
do
not
follow
you
he
said
moved
for
the
first
time
from
his
composure
what
do
you
mean
by
a
knot
of
crape
and
when
was
it
you
obtained
entrance
into
william
room
ah
i
exclaimed
in
dry
retort
you
are
beginning
to
see
that
i
have
something
as
interesting
to
report
as
yourself
did
you
think
me
a
superficial
egotist
without
facts
to
back
my
assertions
i
should
not
have
done
you
that
injustice
i
have
penetrated
i
think
deeper
than
even
yourself
into
character
i
think
him
capable
but
do
satisfy
my
curiosity
on
one
point
first
gryce
how
came
you
to
know
as
much
as
you
do
about
last
night
proceedings
you
could
not
have
been
in
the
house
did
mother
jane
talk
after
she
got
back
the
tip
of
his
cane
was
up
and
he
frowned
at
it
then
the
handle
took
its
place
and
he
gave
it
a
smile
miss
butterworth
said
he
i
have
not
succeeded
in
making
mother
jane
at
any
time
go
beyond
her
numerical
monologue
but
you
have
been
more
successful
and
with
a
sudden
marvellous
change
of
expression
pose
and
manner
he
threw
over
his
head
my
shawl
which
had
fallen
to
the
floor
in
my
astonishment
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
before
me
muttered
grimly
seventy
ten
no
more
i
can
count
no
more
go
gryce
it
was
you
whom
you
interviewed
in
mother
jane
cottage
with
knollys
he
finished
and
it
was
who
helped
to
bury
what
you
now
declare
to
my
real
terror
and
astonishment
to
have
been
a
human
being
miss
butterworth
what
about
the
knot
of
crape
tell
me
xxv
trifles
but
not
trifling
i
was
so
astounded
i
hardly
took
in
this
final
question
had
been
the
sixth
party
in
the
funeral
cortège
i
had
seen
pause
in
the
flower
parlor
well
what
might
i
not
expect
from
this
man
next
but
i
am
methodical
even
under
the
greatest
excitement
and
at
the
most
critical
instants
as
those
who
have
read
affair
next
have
had
ample
opportunity
to
know
once
having
taken
in
the
startling
fact
he
mentioned
i
found
it
impossible
to
proceed
to
establish
my
standpoint
till
i
knew
a
little
more
about
his
wait
i
said
tell
me
first
if
i
have
ever
seen
the
real
mother
jane
or
were
you
the
person
i
saw
stooping
in
the
road
and
of
whom
i
bought
the
pennyroyal
no
he
replied
that
was
the
old
woman
herself
my
appearance
in
the
cottage
dates
from
yesterday
noon
i
felt
the
need
of
being
secretly
near
you
and
i
also
wished
for
an
opportunity
to
examine
this
humble
interior
unsuspected
and
unobserved
so
i
prevailed
upon
the
old
woman
to
exchange
places
with
me
she
taking
up
her
abode
in
the
woods
for
the
night
and
i
her
old
stool
on
the
hearthstone
she
was
the
more
willing
to
do
this
from
the
promise
i
gave
her
to
watch
out
for
lizzie
that
i
would
don
her
own
sunday
suit
and
personate
her
in
her
own
home
she
evidently
did
not
suspect
had
not
wit
enough
i
suppose
at
the
present
moment
she
is
back
in
her
old
place
i
nodded
my
thanks
for
this
explanation
but
was
not
deterred
from
pressing
the
point
i
was
anxious
to
have
elucidated
if
i
went
on
to
urge
you
took
advantage
of
your
disguise
to
act
as
assistant
in
the
burial
which
took
place
last
night
you
are
in
a
much
better
situation
than
myself
to
decide
the
question
we
are
at
present
considering
was
it
because
of
any
secret
knowledge
thus
gained
you
declare
so
positively
that
it
was
not
a
human
being
you
helped
lower
in
its
grave
partially
having
some
skill
in
these
disguises
especially
where
my
own
infirmities
can
have
full
play
as
in
the
case
of
this
strong
but
woman
i
had
no
reason
to
think
my
own
identity
was
suspected
much
less
discovered
therefore
i
could
trust
to
what
i
saw
and
heard
as
being
just
what
mother
jane
herself
would
be
allowed
to
see
or
hear
under
the
same
circumstances
if
therefore
these
young
people
and
this
old
crone
had
been
as
you
seem
to
think
they
are
in
league
for
murder
lucetta
would
hardly
have
greeted
me
as
she
did
when
she
came
down
to
meet
me
in
the
kitchen
and
how
was
that
what
did
she
say
she
said
mother
jane
we
have
a
piece
of
work
for
you
you
are
strong
are
you
not
humph
and
then
she
commiserated
me
a
bit
and
gave
me
food
which
upon
my
word
i
found
hard
to
eat
though
i
had
saved
my
appetite
for
the
occasion
before
she
left
me
she
bade
me
sit
in
the
inglenook
till
she
wanted
me
adding
in
hannah
ear
as
she
passed
her
is
no
use
trying
to
explain
anything
to
her
show
her
when
the
time
comes
what
there
is
to
do
and
trust
to
her
short
memory
to
forget
it
before
she
leaves
the
house
she
could
not
understand
my
brother
propensity
or
our
shame
in
pandering
to
it
so
attempt
nothing
hannah
only
keep
the
money
in
her
view
so
and
that
gave
you
no
idea
it
gave
me
the
idea
i
have
imparted
to
you
or
rather
added
to
the
idea
which
had
been
instilled
in
me
by
others
and
this
idea
was
not
affected
by
what
you
saw
afterwards
not
in
the
least
rather
strengthened
of
the
few
words
i
overheard
one
was
uttered
in
reference
to
yourself
by
miss
knollys
she
said
have
locked
miss
butterworth
again
into
her
room
if
she
accuses
me
of
having
done
so
i
shall
tell
her
our
whole
story
better
she
should
know
the
family
disgrace
than
imagine
us
guilty
of
crimes
of
which
we
are
utterly
incapable
so
so
i
cried
you
heard
that
yes
madam
i
heard
that
and
i
do
not
think
she
knew
she
was
dropping
that
word
into
the
ear
of
a
detective
but
on
this
point
you
are
of
course
at
liberty
to
differ
with
me
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
i
retorted
what
else
did
these
girls
let
fall
in
your
hearing
not
much
it
was
hannah
who
led
me
into
the
upper
hall
and
hannah
who
by
signs
and
signals
rather
than
words
showed
me
what
was
expected
of
me
however
when
after
the
box
was
lowered
into
the
cellar
hannah
was
drawing
me
away
lucetta
stepped
up
and
whispered
in
her
ear
give
her
the
biggest
coin
give
her
the
little
one
or
she
may
mistake
our
reasons
for
secrecy
i
would
like
even
a
fool
to
do
that
even
for
the
moment
it
would
remain
lodged
in
mother
jane
mind
well
well
i
again
cried
certainly
puzzled
for
these
stray
expressions
of
the
sisters
were
in
a
measure
contradictory
not
only
of
the
suspicions
i
entertained
but
of
the
facts
which
had
seemingly
come
to
my
attention
gryce
who
was
probably
watching
my
face
more
closely
than
he
did
the
cane
with
whose
movements
he
was
apparently
engrossed
stopped
to
give
a
caressing
rub
to
the
knob
of
that
same
cane
before
remarking
one
such
peep
behind
the
scenes
is
worth
any
amount
of
surmise
expended
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
curtain
i
let
you
share
my
knowledge
because
it
is
your
due
now
if
you
feel
willing
to
explain
what
you
mean
by
a
knot
of
crape
on
the
shutter
i
am
at
your
service
madam
i
felt
that
it
would
be
cruel
to
delay
my
story
longer
and
so
i
began
it
it
was
evidently
more
interesting
than
he
expected
and
as
i
dilated
upon
the
special
features
which
had
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
a
thinking
suffering
mortal
like
ourselves
who
had
been
shut
up
in
william
room
and
afterwards
buried
in
the
cellar
under
the
flower
parlor
i
saw
his
face
lengthen
and
doubt
take
the
place
of
the
quiet
assurance
with
which
he
had
received
my
various
intimations
up
to
this
time
the
cane
was
laid
aside
and
from
the
action
of
his
right
forefinger
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
i
judged
that
i
was
making
no
small
impression
on
his
mind
when
i
had
finished
he
sat
for
a
minute
silent
then
he
said
thanks
miss
butterworth
you
have
more
than
fulfilled
my
hopes
what
we
buried
was
undoubtedly
human
and
the
question
now
is
who
was
it
and
of
what
death
did
he
die
then
after
a
meaning
pause
think
it
was
silly
rufus
i
will
astonish
you
with
my
reply
no
said
i
i
do
not
that
is
where
you
make
a
mistake
mr
gryce
xxvi
a
point
gained
he
was
surprised
for
all
his
attempts
to
conceal
it
no
said
he
who
then
you
are
becoming
interesting
miss
butterworth
this
i
thought
i
could
afford
to
ignore
yesterday
i
proceeded
i
would
have
declared
it
to
be
silly
rufus
in
the
face
of
god
and
man
but
after
what
i
saw
in
william
room
during
the
hurried
survey
i
gave
it
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
if
the
explanation
we
have
to
give
to
this
affair
is
so
simple
as
that
would
make
it
gryce
in
one
corner
of
that
room
from
which
the
victim
had
so
lately
been
carried
was
a
pair
of
shoes
that
could
never
have
been
worn
by
any
i
have
ever
seen
or
known
of
they
were
loreen
or
possibly
lucetta
no
loreen
and
lucetta
both
have
trim
feet
but
these
were
the
shoes
of
a
child
of
ten
very
dainty
at
that
and
of
a
cut
and
make
worn
by
women
or
rather
i
should
say
by
girls
now
what
do
you
make
of
that
he
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
make
of
it
tap
tap
went
his
finger
on
his
seasoned
palm
and
as
i
watched
the
slowness
with
which
it
fell
i
said
to
myself
i
have
proposed
a
problem
this
time
that
will
tax
even
gryce
powers
of
deduction
and
i
had
it
was
minutes
before
he
ventured
an
opinion
and
then
it
was
with
a
shade
of
doubt
in
his
tone
that
i
acknowledge
to
have
felt
some
pride
in
producing
they
were
lucetta
shoes
the
emotions
under
which
you
labored
very
pardonable
emotions
madam
considering
the
circumstances
and
the
hour
excuse
me
said
i
we
do
not
want
to
waste
a
moment
i
was
excited
suitably
and
duly
excited
or
i
would
have
been
a
stone
but
i
never
lose
my
head
under
excitement
nor
do
i
part
with
my
sense
of
proportion
the
shoes
were
not
lucetta
she
never
wore
any
approaching
them
in
smallness
since
her
tenth
year
has
simsbury
a
daughter
has
there
not
been
a
child
about
the
house
some
time
to
assist
the
cook
in
errands
and
so
on
no
or
i
should
have
seen
her
besides
how
would
the
shoes
of
such
a
person
come
into
william
room
easily
secrecy
was
required
you
were
not
to
be
disturbed
so
shoes
were
taken
off
that
quiet
might
result
was
lucetta
shoeless
or
william
or
even
mother
jane
you
have
not
told
me
that
you
were
requested
to
walk
in
stocking
feet
up
the
hall
no
gryce
the
shoes
were
the
shoes
of
a
girl
i
know
it
because
it
was
matched
by
a
dress
i
saw
hanging
up
in
a
sort
of
wardrobe
ah
you
looked
into
the
wardrobe
i
did
and
felt
justified
in
doing
so
it
was
after
i
had
spied
the
shoes
very
good
and
you
saw
a
dress
a
little
dress
a
dress
with
a
short
skirt
it
was
of
silk
too
another
anomaly
and
the
color
i
think
was
blue
but
i
can
not
swear
to
that
point
i
was
in
great
haste
and
took
the
briefest
glance
but
my
brief
glances
can
be
trusted
gryce
that
i
think
you
are
beginning
to
know
certainly
said
he
and
as
proof
of
it
we
will
now
act
upon
these
two
premises
that
the
victim
in
whose
burial
i
was
an
innocent
partaker
was
a
human
being
and
that
this
human
being
was
a
who
came
into
the
house
well
dressed
now
where
does
that
lead
us
into
a
maze
i
fear
we
are
accustomed
to
mazes
i
observed
yes
he
answered
somewhat
gloomily
but
they
are
not
exactly
desirable
in
this
case
i
want
to
find
the
knollys
family
innocent
and
i
but
william
character
i
fear
will
make
that
impossible
but
this
girl
who
is
she
and
where
did
she
come
from
no
girl
has
been
reported
to
us
as
missing
from
this
neighborhood
i
supposed
not
a
visitor
but
no
visitor
could
enter
this
house
without
it
being
known
far
and
wide
why
i
heard
of
your
arrival
here
before
i
left
the
train
on
which
i
followed
you
had
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
influenced
by
what
the
people
about
here
say
we
would
have
turned
the
knollys
house
inside
out
a
week
ago
but
i
do
believe
in
putting
too
much
confidence
in
the
prejudice
of
country
people
the
idea
they
suggested
and
which
you
suggest
without
putting
it
too
clearly
into
words
is
much
too
horrible
to
be
acted
upon
without
the
best
of
reasons
perhaps
we
have
found
those
reasons
yet
i
still
feel
like
asking
where
did
this
girl
come
from
and
how
could
she
have
become
a
prisoner
in
the
knollys
house
without
the
knowledge
of
madam
have
you
met
mr
trohm
the
question
was
so
sudden
i
had
not
time
to
collect
myself
but
perhaps
it
was
not
necessary
that
i
should
for
the
simple
affirmation
i
used
seemed
to
satisfy
gryce
who
went
on
to
say
it
is
he
who
first
summoned
us
here
and
it
is
he
who
has
the
greatest
interest
in
locating
the
source
of
these
disappearances
yet
he
has
seen
no
child
come
here
trohm
is
not
a
spy
said
i
but
the
remark
happily
fell
unheeded
no
one
has
he
pursued
we
must
give
another
turn
to
our
suppositions
suddenly
a
silence
fell
upon
us
both
his
finger
ceased
to
lay
down
the
law
and
my
gaze
which
had
been
searching
his
face
inquiringly
became
fixed
at
the
same
moment
and
in
much
the
same
tone
of
voice
we
both
spoke
he
saying
humph
and
i
ah
as
a
prelude
to
the
simultaneous
exclamation
the
phantom
coach
we
were
so
pleased
with
this
discovery
that
we
allowed
a
moment
to
pass
in
silent
contemplation
of
each
other
satisfaction
then
he
quietly
added
which
on
the
evening
preceding
your
arrival
came
from
the
mountains
and
passed
into
lost
man
lane
from
which
no
one
ever
saw
it
emerge
it
was
no
phantom
i
put
in
it
was
their
own
old
coach
bringing
to
the
house
a
fresh
victim
this
sounded
so
startling
we
both
sat
still
for
a
moment
lost
in
the
horror
of
it
then
i
spoke
people
living
in
remote
and
isolated
quarters
like
this
are
naturally
superstitious
the
knollys
family
know
this
and
remembering
the
old
legend
forbore
to
contradict
the
conclusions
of
their
neighbors
loreen
emotion
when
the
topic
was
broached
to
her
is
explained
by
this
theory
it
is
not
a
pleasant
one
but
we
can
not
be
wrong
in
contemplating
it
not
at
all
this
apparition
as
they
call
it
was
seen
by
two
persons
therefore
it
was
no
apparition
but
a
real
coach
it
came
from
the
mountains
that
is
from
the
mountain
station
and
it
glided
ah
well
gryce
it
was
its
noiselessness
that
gave
it
its
spectral
appearance
now
i
remember
a
petty
circumstance
which
i
dare
you
to
match
in
corroboration
of
our
suspicions
you
do
i
could
not
repress
a
slight
toss
of
my
head
yes
i
do
i
repeated
he
smiled
and
made
the
slightest
of
deprecatory
gestures
you
have
had
advantages
he
began
and
disadvantages
i
finished
determined
that
he
should
award
me
my
full
meed
of
praise
you
are
probably
not
afraid
of
dogs
i
am
you
could
visit
the
stables
and
did
but
i
found
nothing
there
i
thought
not
i
could
not
help
the
exclamation
it
is
so
seldom
one
can
really
triumph
over
this
man
not
having
the
cue
you
would
not
be
apt
to
see
what
gives
this
whole
thing
away
i
would
never
have
thought
of
it
again
if
we
had
not
had
this
talk
is
simsbury
a
neat
man
a
neat
man
madam
what
do
you
mean
something
important
gryce
if
simsbury
is
a
neat
man
he
will
have
thrown
away
the
old
rags
which
i
dare
promise
you
cumbered
his
stable
floor
the
morning
after
the
phantom
coach
was
seen
to
enter
the
lane
if
he
is
not
you
may
still
find
them
there
one
of
them
i
know
you
will
not
find
he
pulled
it
off
of
his
wheel
with
his
whip
the
afternoon
he
drove
me
down
from
the
station
i
can
see
the
sly
look
he
gave
me
as
he
did
it
it
made
no
impression
on
me
then
but
now
madam
you
have
supplied
the
one
link
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
this
theory
allow
me
to
felicitate
you
upon
it
but
whatever
our
satisfaction
may
be
from
a
professional
standpoint
we
can
not
but
feel
the
unhappy
nature
of
the
responsibility
incurred
by
these
discoveries
if
this
seemingly
respectable
family
stooped
to
such
subterfuge
going
to
the
length
of
winding
rags
around
the
wheels
of
their
lumbering
old
coach
to
make
it
noiseless
and
even
tying
up
their
horse
feet
for
this
same
purpose
they
must
have
had
a
motive
dark
enough
to
warrant
your
worst
suspicions
and
william
was
not
the
only
one
involved
simsbury
at
least
had
a
hand
in
it
nor
does
it
look
as
if
the
girls
were
as
innocent
as
we
would
like
to
consider
them
i
can
not
stop
to
consider
the
girls
i
declared
i
can
no
longer
consider
the
girls
nor
i
he
gloomily
assented
our
duty
requires
us
to
sift
this
matter
and
it
shall
be
sifted
we
must
first
find
if
any
child
alighted
from
the
cars
at
the
mountain
station
on
that
especial
night
or
what
is
more
probable
from
the
little
station
at
five
miles
farther
back
in
the
mountains
and
i
urged
seeing
that
he
had
still
something
to
say
we
must
make
sure
who
lies
buried
under
the
floor
of
the
room
you
call
the
flower
parlor
you
may
expect
me
at
the
knollys
house
some
time
i
shall
come
quietly
but
in
my
own
proper
person
you
are
not
to
know
me
and
unless
you
desire
it
need
not
appear
in
the
matter
i
do
not
desire
it
then
miss
butterworth
my
respect
for
your
abilities
has
risen
even
higher
than
before
we
part
in
a
similar
frame
of
mind
for
once
and
this
he
expected
me
to
regard
as
a
compliment
xxvii
the
text
witnesseth
i
have
a
grim
will
when
i
choose
to
exert
it
after
gryce
left
the
hotel
i
took
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
landlady
and
then
made
a
round
of
the
stores
i
bought
dimity
sewing
silk
and
what
not
as
i
said
i
would
but
this
did
not
occupy
me
long
to
the
regret
probably
of
the
country
merchants
who
expected
to
make
a
fool
of
me
and
found
it
a
by
no
means
easy
task
and
was
quite
ready
for
william
when
he
finally
drove
up
the
ride
home
was
a
more
or
less
silent
one
i
had
conceived
such
a
horror
of
the
man
beside
me
that
talking
for
talk
sake
was
impossible
while
he
was
in
a
mood
which
it
would
be
charity
to
call
it
may
be
that
my
own
reticence
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
but
i
rather
think
not
the
remark
he
made
in
passing
deacon
spear
house
showed
that
something
more
than
spite
was
working
in
his
slow
but
vindictive
brain
there
a
man
of
your
own
sort
he
cried
you
wo
find
him
doing
anything
out
of
the
way
oh
no
pity
your
visit
was
paid
there
you
have
got
a
better
impression
of
the
lane
to
this
i
made
no
reply
at
trohm
he
spoke
again
i
suppose
that
you
and
trohm
had
the
devil
of
a
say
about
lucetta
and
the
rest
of
us
i
do
know
why
but
the
whole
neighborhood
seems
to
feel
they
a
right
to
use
our
name
as
they
choose
but
it
is
going
to
be
so
long
we
have
played
poor
and
pinched
and
starved
all
going
to
i
going
to
have
a
new
horse
and
lucetta
shall
have
a
dress
and
that
mighty
quick
too
i
tired
of
all
this
shabbiness
and
mean
to
have
a
change
i
wanted
to
say
no
change
yet
change
under
the
present
circumstances
would
be
the
worst
thing
possible
for
you
all
but
i
felt
that
this
would
be
treason
to
gryce
and
refrained
saying
simply
as
he
looked
sideways
at
me
for
a
word
lucetta
needs
a
new
dress
that
no
one
can
deny
but
you
had
better
let
me
get
it
for
her
or
perhaps
that
is
what
you
mean
the
grunt
which
was
my
only
answer
might
be
interpreted
in
any
way
i
took
it
however
for
assent
as
soon
as
i
was
relieved
of
his
presence
and
found
myself
again
with
the
girls
i
altered
my
whole
manner
and
cried
out
in
querulous
tones
carter
and
i
have
had
a
difference
this
was
true
we
did
have
a
difference
over
our
cup
of
tea
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
say
this
difference
was
a
forced
one
some
things
we
are
perfectly
justified
in
keeping
to
ourselves
she
remembers
a
certain
verse
in
the
new
testament
one
way
and
i
in
another
we
had
not
time
to
settle
it
by
a
consultation
with
the
sacred
word
but
i
can
not
rest
till
it
is
settled
so
will
you
bring
your
bible
to
me
my
dear
that
i
may
look
that
verse
up
we
were
in
the
upper
hall
where
i
had
taken
a
seat
on
the
sofa
there
lucetta
who
was
standing
before
me
started
immediately
to
do
my
bidding
without
stopping
to
think
poor
child
that
it
was
very
strange
i
did
not
go
to
my
own
room
and
consult
my
own
bible
as
any
good
presbyterian
would
be
expected
to
do
as
she
was
turning
toward
the
large
front
room
i
stopped
her
with
the
quiet
injunction
get
me
one
with
good
print
lucetta
my
eyes
wo
bear
much
straining
at
which
she
turned
and
to
my
great
relief
hurried
down
the
corridor
toward
william
room
from
which
she
presently
returned
bringing
the
very
volume
i
was
anxious
to
consult
meanwhile
i
had
laid
aside
my
hat
i
felt
flurried
and
unhappy
and
showed
it
lucetta
pitiful
face
had
a
strange
sweetness
in
it
this
morning
and
i
felt
sure
as
i
took
the
sacred
book
from
her
hand
that
her
thoughts
were
all
with
the
lover
she
had
sent
from
her
side
and
not
at
all
with
me
or
with
what
at
the
moment
occupied
me
yet
my
thoughts
at
this
moment
involved
without
doubt
the
very
deepest
interests
of
her
life
if
not
that
very
lover
she
was
brooding
over
in
her
darkened
and
resigned
mind
as
i
realized
this
i
heaved
an
involuntary
sigh
which
seemed
to
startle
her
for
she
turned
and
gave
me
a
quick
look
as
she
was
slipping
away
to
join
her
sister
who
was
busy
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
the
bible
i
held
was
an
old
one
of
medium
size
and
most
excellent
print
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
text
and
settling
the
question
which
had
been
my
ostensible
reason
for
wanting
the
book
but
it
took
me
longer
to
discover
the
indentation
which
i
had
made
in
one
of
its
pages
but
when
i
did
you
may
imagine
my
awe
and
the
turmoil
into
which
my
mind
was
cast
when
i
found
that
it
marked
those
great
verses
in
corinthians
which
are
so
universally
read
at
funerals
behold
i
shew
you
a
mystery
we
shall
not
all
sleep
but
we
shall
all
be
changed
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
xxviii
an
intrusion
i
was
so
moved
by
this
discovery
that
i
was
not
myself
for
several
moments
the
reading
of
these
words
over
the
body
which
had
been
laid
away
under
the
flower
parlor
was
in
keeping
with
the
knot
of
crape
on
the
and
argued
something
more
than
remorse
on
the
part
of
some
one
of
the
knollys
family
who
was
this
one
and
why
with
such
feelings
in
the
breast
of
any
of
the
three
had
the
deceit
and
crime
to
which
i
had
been
witness
succeeded
to
such
a
point
as
to
demand
the
attention
of
the
police
an
impossible
problem
of
which
i
dared
seek
no
solution
even
in
the
faces
of
these
seemingly
innocent
girls
i
was
of
course
in
no
position
to
determine
what
plan
gryce
intended
to
pursue
i
only
knew
what
course
i
myself
meant
to
follow
which
was
to
remain
quiet
and
sustain
the
part
i
had
already
played
in
this
house
as
visitor
and
friend
it
was
therefore
as
such
both
in
heart
and
manner
that
i
hastened
from
my
room
late
in
the
afternoon
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
the
cry
i
had
just
heard
issue
from
lucetta
lips
it
had
come
from
the
front
of
the
house
and
as
i
hastened
thither
i
met
the
two
misses
knollys
looking
more
openly
anxious
and
distraught
than
at
any
former
time
of
anxiety
and
trouble
as
they
looked
up
and
saw
my
face
loreen
paused
and
laid
her
hand
on
lucetta
arm
but
lucetta
was
not
to
be
restrained
he
has
dared
to
enter
our
gates
bringing
a
police
officer
with
him
was
her
hoarse
and
almost
unintelligible
cry
we
know
that
the
man
with
him
is
a
police
officer
because
he
was
here
once
before
and
though
he
was
kind
enough
then
he
can
not
have
come
the
second
time
except
to
here
the
pressure
of
loreen
hand
was
so
strong
as
to
make
the
feeble
lucetta
quiver
she
stopped
and
miss
knollys
took
up
her
words
except
to
make
us
talk
on
subjects
much
better
buried
in
oblivion
miss
butterworth
will
you
go
down
with
us
your
presence
may
act
as
a
restraint
trohm
seems
to
have
some
respect
for
you
mr
trohm
yes
it
is
his
coming
which
has
so
agitated
lucetta
he
and
a
man
named
gryce
are
just
coming
up
the
walk
there
goes
the
knocker
lucetta
you
must
control
yourself
or
leave
me
to
face
these
unwelcome
visitors
alone
lucetta
with
a
sudden
fierce
effort
subdued
her
trembling
if
he
must
be
met
said
she
my
anger
and
disdain
may
give
some
weight
to
your
quiet
acceptance
of
the
family
disgrace
i
shall
not
accept
his
denunciations
quietly
loreen
you
must
expect
me
to
show
some
of
the
feelings
that
i
have
held
in
check
all
these
years
and
without
waiting
for
reply
without
waiting
even
to
see
what
effect
these
strange
words
might
have
upon
me
she
dashed
down
the
stairs
and
pulled
open
the
front
door
we
had
followed
rapidly
too
rapidly
for
speech
ourselves
and
were
therefore
in
the
hall
when
the
door
swung
back
revealing
the
two
persons
i
had
been
led
to
expect
trohm
spoke
first
evidently
in
answer
to
the
defiance
to
be
seen
in
lucetta
face
miss
knollys
a
thousand
pardons
i
know
i
am
transgressing
but
i
assure
you
the
occasion
warrants
it
i
am
certain
you
will
acknowledge
this
when
you
hear
what
my
errand
is
your
errand
what
can
your
errand
be
but
to
why
did
she
pause
gryce
had
not
looked
at
her
yet
that
it
was
under
his
influence
she
ceased
to
commit
herself
i
am
as
convinced
as
we
can
be
of
anything
in
a
world
which
is
half
deceit
let
us
hear
your
errand
put
in
loreen
with
that
gentle
emphasis
which
is
no
sign
of
weakness
i
will
let
this
gentleman
speak
for
me
returned
trohm
you
have
seen
him
before
a
new
york
detective
of
whose
business
in
this
town
you
can
not
be
ignorant
lucetta
turned
a
cold
eye
upon
gryce
and
quietly
remarked
when
he
visited
this
lane
a
few
days
ago
he
professed
to
be
seeking
a
clue
to
the
many
disappearances
which
have
unfortunately
taken
place
within
its
precincts
trohm
nod
was
one
of
acquiescence
but
lucetta
was
still
looking
at
the
detective
is
that
your
business
now
she
asked
appealing
directly
to
gryce
his
fatherly
accents
when
he
answered
her
were
a
great
relief
after
the
alternate
iciness
and
fire
with
which
she
had
addressed
his
companion
and
himself
i
hardly
know
how
to
reply
without
arousing
your
just
anger
if
your
brother
is
in
my
brother
would
face
you
with
less
patience
than
we
tell
us
your
errand
gryce
and
do
not
think
of
calling
in
my
brother
till
we
have
failed
to
answer
your
questions
or
satisfy
your
demands
very
well
said
he
the
quickest
explanation
is
the
kindest
in
these
cases
i
merely
wish
as
a
police
officer
whose
business
it
is
to
locate
the
disappearances
which
have
made
this
lane
notorious
and
who
believes
the
surest
way
to
do
this
is
to
find
out
once
and
for
all
where
they
did
not
and
could
not
have
taken
place
to
make
an
official
search
of
these
premises
as
i
already
have
those
of
mother
jane
and
of
deacon
spear
and
my
errand
here
interposed
trohm
is
to
make
everything
easier
by
the
assurance
that
my
house
will
be
the
next
to
undergo
a
complete
investigation
as
all
the
houses
in
the
lane
will
be
visited
alike
none
of
us
need
complain
or
feel
our
good
name
attacked
this
was
certainly
thoughtful
of
him
but
knowing
how
much
they
had
to
fear
i
could
not
expect
loreen
or
lucetta
to
show
any
great
sense
either
of
his
kindness
or
gryce
consideration
they
were
in
no
position
to
have
a
search
made
of
their
premises
and
serene
as
was
loreen
nature
and
powerful
as
was
lucetta
will
the
apprehension
under
which
they
labored
was
evident
to
us
all
though
neither
of
them
attempted
either
subterfuge
or
evasion
if
the
police
wish
to
search
this
house
it
is
open
to
them
said
loreen
but
not
to
trohm
quoth
lucetta
quickly
our
poverty
should
be
our
protection
from
the
curiosity
of
neighbors
trohm
has
no
wish
to
intrude
was
gryce
conciliatory
remark
but
trohm
said
nothing
he
probably
understood
why
lucetta
wished
to
curtail
his
stay
in
this
house
better
than
gryce
did
xxix
in
the
cellar
i
had
meanwhile
stood
silent
there
was
no
reason
for
me
to
obtrude
myself
and
i
was
happy
not
to
do
so
this
does
not
mean
however
that
my
presence
was
not
noticed
trohm
honored
me
with
more
than
one
glance
during
these
trying
moments
in
which
i
read
the
anxiety
he
felt
lest
my
peace
of
mind
should
be
too
much
disturbed
and
when
in
response
to
the
undoubted
dismissal
he
had
received
from
lucetta
he
prepared
to
take
his
leave
it
was
upon
me
he
bestowed
his
final
look
and
most
deferential
bow
it
was
a
tribute
to
my
position
and
character
which
all
seemed
to
feel
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
lucetta
after
carefully
watching
his
departure
turned
to
me
with
childlike
impetuosity
saying
this
must
be
very
unpleasant
for
you
miss
butterworth
yet
must
we
ask
you
to
stand
our
friend
god
knows
we
need
one
i
shall
never
forget
i
occupied
that
position
toward
your
mother
was
my
straightforward
reply
and
i
did
not
forget
it
not
for
a
moment
i
shall
begin
with
the
cellar
gryce
announced
both
girls
quivered
then
loreen
lifted
her
proud
head
and
said
quietly
the
whole
house
is
at
your
disposal
only
i
pray
you
to
be
as
expeditious
as
possible
my
sister
is
not
well
and
the
sooner
our
humiliation
is
over
the
better
it
will
be
for
her
and
indeed
lucetta
was
in
a
state
that
aroused
even
anxiety
but
when
she
saw
us
all
hovering
over
her
she
roused
herself
with
an
extraordinary
effort
and
waving
us
aside
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
from
which
as
i
gathered
the
only
direct
access
could
be
had
to
the
cellar
gryce
immediately
followed
and
behind
him
came
loreen
and
myself
both
too
much
agitated
to
speak
at
the
flower
parlor
gryce
paused
as
if
he
had
forgotten
something
but
lucetta
urged
him
feverishly
on
and
before
long
we
were
all
standing
in
the
kitchen
here
a
surprise
awaited
us
two
men
were
sitting
there
who
appeared
to
be
strangers
to
hannah
from
the
lowering
looks
she
cast
them
as
she
pretended
to
be
busy
over
her
stove
this
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
her
usual
good
humor
as
to
attract
the
attention
even
of
her
young
mistress
what
is
the
matter
hannah
asked
lucetta
and
who
are
these
men
they
are
my
men
said
gryce
the
job
i
have
undertaken
can
not
be
carried
on
alone
the
quick
look
the
two
sisters
interchanged
did
not
escape
me
or
the
quiet
air
of
resignation
which
was
settling
slowly
over
loreen
must
they
go
into
the
cellar
too
she
asked
gryce
smiled
his
most
fatherly
smile
as
he
said
my
dear
young
ladies
these
men
are
interested
in
but
one
thing
they
are
searching
for
a
clue
to
the
disappearances
that
have
occurred
in
this
lane
as
they
will
not
find
this
in
your
cellar
nothing
else
that
they
may
see
there
will
remain
in
their
minds
for
a
moment
lucetta
said
no
more
even
her
indomitable
spirit
was
giving
way
before
the
inevitable
discovery
that
threatened
them
do
not
let
william
know
were
the
low
words
with
which
she
passed
hannah
but
from
the
short
glimpse
i
caught
of
william
burly
figure
standing
in
the
stable
door
under
the
guardianship
of
two
detectives
i
felt
this
injunction
to
be
quite
superfluous
william
evidently
did
know
i
was
not
going
to
descend
the
cellar
stairs
but
the
girls
made
me
we
want
you
with
us
loreen
declared
in
no
ordinary
tones
while
lucetta
paused
and
would
not
go
on
till
i
followed
this
surprised
me
i
no
longer
seemed
to
have
any
clue
to
their
motives
but
i
was
glad
to
be
one
of
the
party
hannah
under
loreen
orders
had
furnished
one
of
the
men
with
a
lighted
lantern
and
upon
our
descent
into
the
dark
labyrinth
below
it
became
his
duty
to
lead
the
way
which
he
did
with
due
circumspection
what
all
this
underground
space
into
which
we
were
thus
introduced
had
ever
been
used
for
it
would
be
difficult
to
tell
at
present
it
was
mostly
empty
after
passing
a
small
collection
of
stores
a
the
very
door
of
which
was
unhinged
and
lay
across
the
cellar
bottom
we
struck
into
a
hollow
void
in
which
there
was
nothing
worth
an
investigation
save
the
earth
under
our
feet
this
the
two
foremost
detectives
examined
very
carefully
detaining
us
often
longer
i
thought
than
gryce
desired
or
lucetta
had
patience
for
but
nothing
was
said
in
protest
nor
did
the
older
detective
give
an
order
or
manifest
any
special
interest
in
the
investigation
till
he
saw
the
men
in
front
stoop
and
throw
out
of
the
way
a
coil
of
rope
when
he
immediately
hurried
forward
and
called
upon
the
party
to
stop
the
girls
who
were
on
either
side
of
me
crossed
glances
at
this
command
and
lucetta
who
had
been
tottering
for
the
last
few
minutes
fell
upon
her
knees
and
hid
her
face
in
the
hollow
of
her
two
hands
loreen
came
around
and
stood
by
her
and
i
do
not
know
which
of
them
presented
the
most
striking
picture
of
despair
the
shrinking
lucetta
or
loreen
with
her
quivering
form
uplifted
to
meet
the
shafts
of
fate
without
a
droop
of
her
eyelids
or
a
murmur
from
her
lips
the
light
of
the
one
lantern
which
intentionally
or
unintentionally
was
concentrated
on
this
pathetic
group
made
it
stand
out
from
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
darkness
in
a
way
to
draw
the
gaze
of
gryce
upon
them
he
looked
and
his
own
brow
became
overcast
evidently
we
were
not
far
from
the
cause
of
their
fears
ordering
the
candle
lifted
he
surveyed
the
ceiling
above
at
which
loreen
lips
opened
slightly
in
secret
dread
and
amazement
then
he
commanded
the
men
to
move
on
slowly
while
he
himself
looked
overhead
rather
than
underneath
which
seemed
to
astonish
his
associates
who
evidently
had
heard
nothing
of
the
hole
which
had
been
cut
in
the
floor
of
the
flower
parlor
suddenly
i
heard
a
slight
gasp
from
lucetta
who
had
not
moved
forward
with
the
rest
of
us
then
her
rushing
figure
flew
by
us
and
took
up
its
stand
by
gryce
who
had
himself
paused
and
was
pointing
with
an
imperious
forefinger
to
the
ground
under
his
feet
you
will
dig
here
said
he
not
heeding
her
though
i
am
sure
he
was
as
well
acquainted
with
her
proximity
as
we
dig
repeated
loreen
in
what
we
all
saw
was
a
final
effort
to
stave
off
disgrace
and
misery
my
duty
demands
it
said
he
some
one
else
has
been
digging
here
within
a
very
few
days
miss
knollys
that
is
as
evident
as
is
the
fact
that
a
communication
has
been
made
with
this
place
through
an
opening
into
the
room
above
see
and
taking
the
lantern
from
the
man
at
his
side
he
held
it
up
toward
the
ceiling
there
was
no
hole
there
now
but
there
were
ample
evidences
of
there
having
been
one
and
that
within
a
very
short
time
loreen
made
no
further
attempt
to
stay
him
the
house
is
at
your
disposal
she
reiterated
but
i
do
not
think
she
knew
what
she
said
the
man
with
the
bundle
in
his
arms
was
already
unrolling
it
on
the
cellar
bottom
a
spade
came
to
light
together
with
some
other
tools
lifting
the
spade
he
thrust
it
smartly
into
the
ground
toward
which
gryce
inexorable
finger
still
pointed
at
the
sight
and
the
sound
it
made
a
thrill
passed
through
lucetta
which
made
her
another
creature
dashing
forward
she
flung
herself
down
upon
the
spot
with
lifted
head
and
outstretched
arms
stop
your
desecrating
hand
she
cried
this
is
a
grave
the
grave
sirs
of
our
mother
xxx
investigation
the
shock
of
these
words
if
false
most
horrible
if
true
still
more
horrible
threw
us
all
aback
and
made
even
gryce
features
assume
an
aspect
quite
uncommon
to
them
your
mother
grave
said
he
looking
from
her
to
loreen
with
very
evident
doubt
i
thought
your
mother
died
seven
or
more
years
ago
and
this
grave
has
been
dug
within
three
days
i
know
she
whispered
to
the
world
my
mother
has
been
dead
many
many
years
but
not
to
us
we
closed
her
eyes
night
before
last
and
it
was
to
preserve
this
secret
which
involves
others
affecting
our
family
honor
that
we
resorted
to
expedients
which
have
perhaps
attracted
the
notice
of
the
police
and
drawn
this
humiliation
down
upon
us
i
can
conceive
no
other
reason
for
this
visit
ushered
in
as
it
was
by
mr
trohm
miss
lucetta
gryce
spoke
quickly
if
he
had
not
i
certainly
could
not
have
restrained
some
expression
of
the
emotions
awakened
in
my
own
breast
by
this
astounding
revelation
miss
lucetta
it
is
not
necessary
to
bring
trohm
name
into
this
matter
or
that
of
any
other
person
than
myself
i
saw
the
coffin
lowered
here
which
you
say
contained
the
body
of
your
mother
thinking
this
a
strange
place
of
burial
and
not
knowing
it
was
your
mother
to
whom
you
were
paying
these
last
dutiful
rites
i
took
advantage
of
my
position
as
detective
to
satisfy
myself
that
nothing
wrong
lay
behind
so
mysterious
a
death
and
burial
can
you
blame
me
miss
would
i
have
been
a
man
to
trust
if
i
had
let
such
an
event
as
this
go
by
unchallenged
she
did
not
answer
she
had
heard
but
one
sentence
of
all
this
long
speech
you
saw
my
mother
coffin
lowered
where
were
you
that
you
should
see
that
in
some
of
these
dark
passages
let
in
by
i
know
not
what
traitor
to
our
peace
of
mind
and
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
have
grown
almost
supernaturally
large
and
bright
under
her
emotions
turned
slowly
in
their
sockets
till
they
rested
with
something
like
doubtful
accusation
upon
mine
but
not
to
remain
there
for
gryce
recalled
them
almost
instantly
by
this
short
sharp
negative
no
i
was
nearer
than
that
i
lent
my
strength
to
this
burial
if
you
had
thought
to
look
under
mother
jane
hood
you
would
have
seen
what
would
have
forced
these
explanations
then
and
there
and
you
i
was
mother
jane
for
the
nonce
not
from
choice
miss
but
from
necessity
i
was
impersonating
the
old
woman
when
your
brother
came
to
the
cottage
i
could
not
give
away
my
plans
by
refusing
the
task
your
brother
offered
me
it
is
well
lucetta
had
risen
and
was
now
standing
by
the
side
of
loreen
such
a
secret
as
ours
defies
concealment
even
providence
takes
part
against
us
what
you
want
to
know
we
must
tell
but
i
assure
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
you
profess
to
be
chiefly
interested
in
nothing
at
all
then
perhaps
you
and
your
sister
will
retire
said
he
distracted
as
you
are
by
family
griefs
i
would
not
wish
to
add
one
iota
to
your
distress
this
lady
whom
you
seem
to
regard
with
more
or
less
favor
as
friend
or
relative
will
stay
to
see
that
no
dishonor
is
paid
to
your
mother
remains
but
your
mother
face
we
must
see
miss
lucetta
if
only
to
lighten
the
explanations
you
will
doubtless
feel
called
upon
to
make
it
was
loreen
who
answered
this
if
it
must
be
said
she
remember
your
own
mother
and
deal
reverently
with
ours
which
entreaty
and
the
way
it
was
uttered
gave
me
my
first
distinct
conviction
that
these
girls
were
speaking
the
truth
and
that
the
diminutive
body
we
had
come
to
unearth
was
that
of
althea
knollys
whose
form
i
had
so
long
supposed
commingled
with
foreign
soil
the
thought
was
almost
too
much
for
my
and
i
advanced
upon
loreen
with
a
dozen
burning
questions
on
my
lips
when
the
voice
of
gryce
stopped
me
explanations
later
said
he
for
the
present
we
want
you
here
it
was
no
easy
task
for
me
to
linger
there
with
all
my
doubts
unsolved
waiting
for
the
decisive
moment
when
gryce
should
say
come
look
is
it
she
but
the
will
that
had
already
sustained
me
through
so
many
trying
experiences
did
not
fail
me
now
and
grievous
as
was
the
ordeal
i
passed
steadily
through
it
being
able
to
say
though
not
without
some
emotion
i
own
it
is
althea
knollys
changed
almost
beyond
conception
but
still
these
girls
mother
which
was
a
happier
end
to
this
adventure
than
that
we
had
first
feared
mysterious
as
the
event
was
not
only
to
myself
but
as
i
could
see
to
the
acute
detective
as
well
the
girls
had
withdrawn
long
before
this
just
as
gryce
had
desired
and
i
now
expected
to
be
allowed
to
join
them
but
gryce
detained
me
till
the
grave
was
refilled
and
made
decent
again
when
he
turned
and
to
my
intense
astonishment
for
i
had
thought
the
matter
was
all
over
and
the
exoneration
of
this
household
complete
said
softly
and
with
telling
emphasis
in
my
ear
our
work
is
not
done
yet
they
who
make
graves
so
readily
in
cellars
must
have
been
more
or
less
accustomed
to
the
work
we
have
still
some
digging
to
do
xxxi
strategy
i
was
overwhelmed
what
said
i
you
still
doubt
i
always
doubt
he
gravely
replied
this
cellar
bottom
offers
a
wide
field
for
speculation
too
wide
perhaps
but
then
i
have
a
plan
here
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
a
few
concise
sentences
into
my
ear
in
a
tone
so
low
i
should
feel
that
i
was
betraying
his
confidence
in
repeating
them
but
their
import
will
soon
become
apparent
from
what
presently
occurred
light
miss
butterworth
to
the
stairway
gryce
now
commanded
one
of
the
men
and
thus
accompanied
i
found
my
way
back
to
the
kitchen
where
hannah
was
bemoaning
uncomforted
the
shame
which
had
come
upon
the
house
i
did
not
stop
to
soothe
her
that
was
not
my
cue
nor
would
it
have
answered
my
purpose
on
the
contrary
i
broke
into
angry
ejaculations
as
i
passed
her
what
a
shame
those
wretches
can
not
be
got
away
from
the
cellar
what
do
you
suppose
they
expect
to
find
there
i
left
them
poking
hither
and
thither
in
a
way
that
will
be
very
irritating
to
miss
knollys
when
she
finds
it
out
i
wonder
william
stands
it
what
she
said
in
reply
i
do
not
know
i
was
half
way
down
the
hall
before
my
own
words
were
finished
my
next
move
was
to
go
to
my
room
and
take
from
my
trunk
a
tiny
hammer
and
some
very
small
tacks
curious
articles
you
will
think
for
a
woman
to
carry
on
her
travels
but
i
am
a
woman
of
experience
and
have
known
only
too
often
what
it
was
to
want
these
petty
conveniences
and
not
be
able
to
get
them
they
were
to
serve
me
an
odd
turn
now
taking
a
tacks
in
one
hand
and
concealing
the
hammer
in
my
bag
i
started
boldly
for
william
room
i
knew
that
the
girls
were
not
there
for
i
had
heard
them
talking
together
in
the
as
i
came
up
besides
if
they
were
i
had
a
ready
answer
for
any
demand
they
might
make
searching
out
his
boots
i
turned
them
over
and
into
the
sole
of
each
i
drove
one
of
my
small
tacks
then
i
put
them
back
in
the
same
place
and
position
in
which
i
found
them
task
number
one
was
accomplished
when
i
issued
from
the
room
i
went
as
quickly
as
i
could
below
i
was
now
ready
for
a
talk
with
the
girls
whom
i
found
as
i
had
anticipated
talking
and
weeping
together
in
the
they
rose
as
i
came
in
awaiting
my
first
words
in
evident
anxiety
they
had
not
heard
me
go
i
immediately
allowed
my
anxiety
and
profound
interest
in
this
matter
to
have
full
play
my
poor
girls
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
your
mother
just
dead
and
the
matter
kept
from
me
her
friend
it
is
astounding
incomprehensible
i
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
or
of
you
it
has
a
strange
look
loreen
gravely
admitted
but
we
had
reasons
for
this
deception
miss
butterworth
our
mother
charming
and
sweet
as
you
remember
her
has
not
always
done
right
or
what
you
will
better
understand
she
committed
a
criminal
act
against
a
person
in
this
town
the
penalty
of
which
is
state
prison
with
difficulty
the
words
came
out
with
difficulty
she
kept
down
the
flush
of
shame
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
and
did
overwhelm
her
more
sensitive
sister
but
her
was
great
and
she
went
bravely
on
while
i
in
faint
imitation
of
her
courage
restrained
my
own
surprise
and
intolerable
sense
of
shock
and
bitter
sorrow
under
a
guise
of
simple
sympathy
it
was
forgery
she
explained
this
has
never
before
passed
our
lips
though
a
cherished
wife
and
a
beloved
mother
she
longed
for
many
things
my
father
could
not
give
her
and
in
an
evil
hour
she
imitated
the
name
of
a
rich
man
here
and
took
the
check
thus
signed
to
new
york
the
fraud
was
not
detected
and
she
received
the
money
but
ultimately
the
rich
man
whose
money
she
had
spent
discovered
the
use
she
had
made
of
his
name
and
if
she
had
not
escaped
would
have
had
her
arrested
but
she
left
the
country
and
the
only
revenge
he
took
was
to
swear
that
if
she
ever
set
foot
again
in
he
would
call
the
police
down
upon
her
yes
if
she
were
dying
and
they
had
to
drag
her
from
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
he
would
have
done
it
and
knowing
this
we
have
lived
under
the
shadow
of
this
fear
for
eleven
years
my
father
died
under
it
and
my
mother
ah
she
spent
all
the
remaining
years
of
her
life
under
foreign
skies
but
when
she
felt
the
hand
of
death
upon
her
her
affection
for
her
own
flesh
and
blood
triumphed
over
her
discretion
and
she
came
secretly
i
own
but
still
with
that
horror
menacing
her
to
these
doors
and
begging
our
forgiveness
lay
down
under
the
roof
where
we
were
born
and
died
with
the
halo
of
our
love
about
her
ah
said
i
thinking
of
all
that
had
happened
since
i
had
come
into
this
house
and
finding
nothing
but
confirmation
of
what
she
was
saying
i
begin
to
understand
but
lucetta
shook
her
head
no
said
she
you
can
not
understand
yet
we
who
had
worn
mourning
for
her
because
my
father
wished
to
make
this
very
return
impossible
knew
nothing
of
what
was
in
store
for
us
till
a
letter
came
saying
she
would
be
at
the
station
on
the
very
night
we
received
it
to
acknowledge
our
deception
to
seek
and
bring
her
home
openly
to
this
house
could
not
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
how
then
could
we
satisfy
her
dying
wishes
without
compromising
her
memory
and
ourselves
perhaps
you
have
guessed
miss
butterworth
you
have
had
time
since
we
revealed
the
unhappy
secret
of
this
household
yes
said
i
i
have
guessed
lucetta
with
her
hand
laid
on
mine
looked
wistfully
into
my
face
do
blame
us
she
cried
our
mother
good
name
is
everything
to
us
and
we
knew
no
other
way
to
preserve
it
than
by
making
use
of
the
one
superstition
of
this
place
alas
our
efforts
were
in
vain
the
phantom
coach
brought
our
mother
safely
to
us
but
the
circumstances
which
led
to
our
doors
being
opened
to
outsiders
rendered
it
impossible
for
us
to
carry
out
our
plans
unsuspected
her
grave
has
been
discovered
and
desecrated
and
we
she
stopped
choked
loreen
took
advantage
of
her
silence
to
pursue
the
explanations
she
seemed
to
think
necessary
it
was
simsbury
who
undertook
to
bring
our
dying
mother
from
station
to
our
door
he
has
a
crafty
spirit
under
his
meek
ways
and
dressed
himself
in
a
way
to
lend
color
to
the
superstition
he
hoped
to
awaken
william
who
did
not
dare
to
accompany
him
for
fear
of
arousing
gossip
was
at
the
gate
when
the
coach
drove
in
it
was
he
who
lifted
our
mother
out
and
it
was
while
she
still
clung
to
him
with
her
face
pressed
close
to
his
breast
that
we
saw
her
first
ah
what
a
pitiable
sight
it
was
she
was
so
wan
so
feeble
and
yet
so
radiantly
happy
she
looked
up
at
lucetta
and
her
face
grew
wonderful
in
its
unearthly
beauty
she
was
not
the
mother
we
remembered
but
a
mother
whose
life
had
culminated
in
the
one
desire
to
see
and
clasp
her
children
again
when
she
could
tear
her
eyes
away
from
lucetta
she
looked
at
me
and
then
the
tears
came
and
we
all
wept
together
even
william
and
thus
weeping
and
murmuring
words
of
welcome
and
cheer
we
carried
her
and
laid
her
in
the
great
front
chamber
alas
we
did
not
foresee
what
would
happen
the
very
next
morning
i
mean
the
arrival
of
your
telegram
to
be
followed
so
soon
by
yourself
poor
girls
poor
girls
it
was
all
i
could
say
i
was
completely
overwhelmed
the
first
night
after
your
arrival
we
moved
her
into
william
room
as
being
more
remote
and
thus
a
safer
refuge
for
her
the
next
night
she
died
the
dream
which
you
had
of
being
locked
in
your
room
was
no
dream
lucetta
did
that
in
foolish
precaution
against
your
trying
to
search
us
out
in
the
night
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
taken
you
into
our
confidence
yes
i
assented
that
would
have
been
better
but
i
did
not
say
how
much
better
that
would
have
been
giving
away
my
secret
lucetta
had
now
recovered
sufficiently
to
go
on
with
the
story
william
who
is
naturally
colder
than
we
and
less
sensitive
in
regard
to
our
mother
good
name
has
shown
some
little
impatience
at
the
restraint
imposed
upon
him
by
her
presence
and
this
was
an
extra
burden
miss
butterworth
but
that
and
all
the
others
we
have
been
forced
to
bear
the
generous
girl
did
not
speak
of
her
own
special
grief
and
loss
have
all
been
rendered
useless
by
the
unhappy
chance
which
has
brought
into
our
midst
this
agent
of
the
police
ah
if
i
only
knew
whether
this
was
the
providence
of
god
rebuking
us
for
years
of
deception
or
just
the
malice
of
man
seeking
to
rob
us
of
our
one
best
treasure
a
mother
untarnished
name
gryce
acts
from
no
malice
i
began
but
i
saw
they
were
not
listening
have
they
finished
down
below
asked
lucetta
does
the
man
you
call
gryce
seem
satisfied
asked
loreen
i
drew
myself
up
physically
and
mentally
my
second
task
was
about
to
begin
i
do
not
understand
those
men
said
i
they
seem
to
want
to
look
farther
than
the
sacred
spot
where
we
left
them
if
they
are
going
through
a
form
they
are
doing
it
very
thoroughly
that
is
their
duty
observed
loreen
but
lucetta
took
it
less
calmly
it
is
an
unhappy
day
for
us
cried
she
shame
after
shame
disgrace
upon
disgrace
i
wish
we
had
all
died
in
our
childhood
loreen
i
must
see
william
he
will
be
doing
some
foolish
thing
swearing
or
my
dear
let
me
go
to
william
i
urgently
put
in
he
may
not
like
me
overmuch
but
i
will
at
least
prove
a
restraint
to
him
you
are
too
feeble
see
you
ought
to
be
lying
on
the
couch
instead
of
trying
to
drag
yourself
out
to
the
stables
and
indeed
at
that
moment
lucetta
strength
gave
suddenly
out
and
she
sank
into
loreen
arms
insensible
when
she
was
restored
i
hurried
away
to
the
stables
still
in
pursuit
of
the
task
which
i
had
not
yet
completed
i
found
william
sitting
doggedly
on
a
stool
in
the
open
doorway
grunting
out
short
sentences
to
the
two
men
who
lounged
in
his
vicinity
on
either
side
he
was
angry
but
not
as
angry
as
i
had
seen
him
many
times
before
the
men
were
townsfolk
and
listened
eagerly
to
his
broken
sentences
one
or
two
of
these
reached
my
ears
let
go
it
it
wo
be
now
or
they
settle
this
business
it
the
devil
work
and
devils
are
sly
my
house
wo
give
up
that
secret
or
any
other
house
they
be
likely
to
visit
the
place
i
would
ransack
but
loreen
would
say
i
was
babbling
goodness
knows
a
fellow
got
to
talk
about
something
when
his
come
to
see
him
and
here
his
laugh
broke
in
harsh
cruel
and
insulting
i
felt
it
did
him
no
good
and
made
haste
to
show
myself
immediately
his
whole
appearance
changed
he
was
so
astonished
to
see
me
there
that
for
a
moment
he
was
absolutely
silent
then
he
broke
out
again
into
another
loud
guffaw
but
this
time
in
a
different
tone
why
it
miss
butterworth
he
laughed
here
saracen
come
pay
your
respects
to
the
lady
who
likes
you
so
well
and
saracen
came
but
i
did
not
forsake
my
ground
i
had
espied
in
one
corner
just
what
i
had
hoped
to
see
there
and
saracen
presence
afforded
me
the
opportunity
of
indulging
in
one
or
two
rather
curious
antics
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
dog
i
declared
with
marked
loftiness
shrinking
toward
the
pail
of
water
i
had
already
marked
with
my
eye
not
at
all
afraid
i
continued
catching
up
the
pail
and
putting
it
before
me
as
the
dog
made
a
wild
rush
in
my
direction
these
gentlemen
will
not
see
me
hurt
and
though
they
all
laughed
they
would
have
been
fools
if
they
had
not
and
the
dog
jumped
the
pail
and
i
jumped
not
a
pail
but
a
that
was
lying
amid
all
the
rest
of
the
disorder
on
the
floor
they
did
not
see
that
i
had
succeeded
in
doing
what
i
wished
which
was
to
place
that
pail
so
near
to
william
feet
that
but
wait
a
moment
everything
in
its
own
time
i
escaped
the
dog
and
next
moment
had
my
eye
on
him
he
did
not
move
after
that
which
rather
put
a
stop
to
the
laughter
which
observing
i
drew
very
near
to
william
and
with
a
sly
gesture
to
the
two
men
which
for
some
reason
they
seemed
to
understand
whispered
in
the
rude
fellow
ear
they
found
your
mother
grave
under
the
flower
parlor
your
sisters
told
me
to
tell
you
but
that
is
not
all
they
trampling
hither
and
yon
through
all
the
secret
places
in
the
cellar
turning
up
the
earth
with
their
spades
i
know
they
wo
find
anything
but
we
thought
you
ought
to
know
here
i
made
a
feint
of
being
startled
and
ceased
my
second
task
was
done
the
third
only
remained
fortunately
at
that
moment
gryce
and
his
followers
showed
themselves
in
the
garden
they
had
just
come
from
the
cellar
and
played
their
part
in
the
same
spirit
i
had
mine
though
they
were
too
far
off
for
their
words
to
be
heard
the
air
of
secrecy
they
maintained
and
the
dubious
looks
they
cast
towards
the
stable
could
not
but
evince
even
to
william
dull
understanding
that
their
investigations
had
resulted
in
a
doubt
which
left
them
far
from
satisfied
but
once
this
impression
made
they
did
not
linger
long
together
the
man
with
the
lantern
moved
off
and
gryce
turned
towards
us
changing
his
whole
appearance
as
he
advanced
till
no
one
could
look
more
cheerful
and
well
that
is
over
he
sighed
with
a
forced
air
of
infinite
relief
mere
form
knollys
mere
form
we
have
to
go
through
these
pretended
investigations
at
times
and
good
people
like
yourself
have
to
submit
but
i
assure
you
it
is
not
pleasant
and
under
the
present
circumstances
i
am
sure
you
understand
me
knollys
the
task
has
occasioned
me
a
feeling
almost
of
remorse
but
that
is
inseparable
from
a
detective
life
he
is
obliged
every
day
of
his
life
to
ride
over
the
tenderest
emotions
forgive
me
and
now
boys
scatter
till
i
call
you
together
again
i
hope
our
next
search
will
be
without
such
sorrowful
accompaniments
it
succeeded
william
stared
at
him
and
stared
at
the
men
slowly
filing
off
down
the
yard
but
was
not
for
a
moment
deceived
by
these
overflowing
expressions
on
the
contrary
he
looked
more
concerned
than
he
had
while
seated
between
the
two
men
manifestly
set
to
guard
him
the
deuce
he
cried
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
that
expressed
anything
but
satisfaction
lucetta
always
said
but
even
he
knew
enough
not
to
finish
that
sentence
low
as
he
had
mumbled
it
watching
him
and
watching
gryce
who
at
that
moment
turned
to
follow
his
men
i
thought
the
time
had
come
for
action
making
another
spring
as
if
in
fresh
terror
of
saracen
who
by
the
way
was
eying
me
with
the
meekness
of
a
lamb
i
tipped
over
that
pail
with
such
suddenness
and
with
such
dexterity
that
its
whole
contents
poured
in
one
flood
over
feet
my
third
task
was
accomplished
the
oath
he
uttered
and
the
excuses
which
i
volubly
poured
forth
could
not
have
reached
gryce
ears
for
he
did
not
return
and
yet
from
the
way
his
shoulders
shook
as
he
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
house
i
judge
that
he
was
not
entirely
ignorant
of
the
subterfuge
by
which
i
hoped
to
force
this
blundering
booby
of
ours
to
change
the
boots
he
wore
for
one
of
the
pairs
into
which
i
had
driven
those
little
tacks
xxxii
relief
the
plan
succeeded
gryce
plans
usually
do
william
went
immediately
to
his
room
and
in
a
little
while
came
down
and
hastened
into
the
cellar
i
want
to
see
what
mischief
they
have
done
said
he
when
he
came
back
his
face
was
beaming
all
right
he
shouted
to
his
sisters
who
had
come
into
the
hall
to
meet
him
your
secret
out
but
mine
there
there
interposed
loreen
you
had
better
go
and
prepare
for
supper
we
must
eat
william
or
rather
miss
butterworth
must
eat
whatever
our
sorrows
or
disappointments
he
took
the
rebuke
with
a
grunt
and
relieved
us
of
his
company
little
did
he
think
as
he
went
whistling
up
the
stairs
that
he
had
just
shown
gryce
where
to
search
for
whatever
might
be
lying
under
the
broad
sweep
of
that
that
night
it
was
after
supper
which
i
did
not
eat
for
all
my
natural
stoicism
hannah
came
rushing
in
where
we
all
sat
silent
for
the
girls
showed
no
disposition
to
enlarge
their
confidences
in
regard
to
their
mother
and
no
other
topic
seemed
possible
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
said
quickly
and
with
evident
chagrin
those
men
are
here
again
they
say
they
forgot
something
what
do
you
think
it
means
miss
loreen
they
have
spades
and
lanterns
and
they
are
the
police
hannah
if
they
forgot
something
they
have
the
right
to
return
do
work
yourself
up
about
that
the
secret
they
have
already
found
out
was
our
worst
there
is
nothing
to
fear
after
that
and
she
dismissed
hannah
merely
bidding
her
let
us
know
when
the
house
was
quite
clear
was
she
right
was
there
nothing
worse
for
them
to
fear
i
longed
to
leave
these
trembling
sisters
longed
to
join
the
party
below
and
follow
in
the
track
of
the
tiny
impressions
made
by
the
tacks
i
had
driven
into
william
soles
if
there
was
anything
hidden
under
the
natural
anxiety
would
carry
him
to
the
spot
he
had
most
to
fear
so
they
would
only
have
to
dig
at
the
places
where
these
impressions
took
a
sharp
turn
but
was
there
anything
hidden
there
from
the
sisters
words
and
actions
i
judged
there
was
nothing
serious
but
would
they
know
william
was
quite
capable
of
deceiving
them
had
he
done
so
it
was
a
question
it
was
solved
for
us
by
gryce
reappearance
in
the
room
an
hour
or
so
later
from
the
moment
the
light
fell
upon
his
kindly
features
i
knew
that
i
might
breathe
again
freely
it
was
not
the
face
he
showed
in
the
house
of
a
criminal
nor
did
his
bow
contain
any
of
the
false
deference
with
which
he
sometimes
tries
to
hide
his
secret
doubt
or
contempt
i
have
come
to
trouble
you
for
the
last
time
ladies
we
have
made
a
double
search
through
this
house
and
through
the
stables
and
feel
perfectly
justified
in
saying
that
our
duty
henceforth
will
lead
us
elsewhere
the
secrets
we
have
surprised
are
your
own
and
if
possible
shall
remain
so
your
brother
propensity
for
vivisection
and
the
return
and
death
of
your
mother
bear
so
little
on
the
real
question
which
interests
this
community
that
we
may
be
able
to
prevent
their
spread
as
gossip
through
the
town
that
this
may
be
done
conscientiously
however
i
ought
to
know
something
more
of
the
latter
circumstance
if
miss
butterworth
will
then
be
good
enough
to
grant
me
a
few
minutes
conference
with
these
ladies
i
may
be
able
to
satisfy
myself
to
such
an
extent
as
to
let
this
matter
rest
where
it
is
i
rose
with
right
good
will
a
mountain
weight
had
been
lifted
from
me
proof
positive
that
i
had
really
come
to
love
these
girls
what
they
told
him
whether
it
was
less
or
more
than
they
told
me
i
can
not
say
and
for
the
moment
did
not
know
that
it
had
not
shaken
his
faith
in
them
was
evident
for
when
he
came
out
to
where
i
was
waiting
in
the
hall
his
aspect
was
even
more
encouraging
than
it
had
been
before
no
guile
in
those
girls
he
whispered
as
he
passed
me
the
clue
given
by
what
seemed
mysterious
in
this
house
has
come
to
naught
we
take
up
another
the
trinkets
found
in
mother
jane
cottage
are
something
real
you
may
sleep
soundly
miss
butterworth
your
part
has
been
well
played
but
i
know
you
are
glad
that
it
has
failed
and
i
knew
that
i
was
glad
too
which
is
the
best
proof
that
there
is
something
in
me
besides
the
detective
instinct
the
front
door
had
scarcely
closed
behind
him
when
william
came
storming
in
he
had
been
gossiping
over
the
fence
with
trohm
and
had
been
beguiled
into
taking
a
glass
of
wine
in
his
house
this
was
evident
without
his
speaking
of
it
those
sneaks
cried
he
i
hear
they
been
back
again
digging
and
stirring
up
our
like
mad
that
because
you
so
dreadful
shy
you
girls
you
afraid
of
this
you
afraid
of
that
you
do
want
folks
to
know
that
mother
once
well
well
there
it
is
now
if
you
had
not
tried
to
keep
this
wretched
secret
it
would
have
been
an
old
matter
by
this
time
and
my
affairs
would
have
been
left
untouched
but
now
every
fool
will
cry
out
at
me
in
this
staid
puritanical
old
town
and
all
because
a
few
bones
have
been
found
of
animals
which
have
died
in
the
cause
of
science
i
say
it
all
your
fault
not
that
i
have
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
because
i
have
but
because
this
other
thing
this
d
d
wicked
series
of
disappearances
taking
place
for
aught
we
know
a
dozen
rods
from
our
gates
though
i
think
but
no
matter
what
i
think
you
all
like
or
say
you
like
old
deacon
spear
has
made
every
one
so
touchy
in
this
pharisaical
town
that
to
kill
a
fly
has
become
a
crime
even
if
it
is
to
save
oneself
from
poison
i
going
to
see
if
i
can
not
make
folks
blink
askance
at
some
other
man
than
me
i
going
to
find
out
who
or
what
causes
these
disappearances
this
was
a
declaration
to
make
us
all
stare
and
look
a
little
bit
foolish
william
playing
the
detective
well
what
might
i
not
live
to
see
next
but
the
next
moment
an
overpowering
thought
struck
me
might
this
deacon
spear
by
any
chance
be
the
rich
man
whose
animosity
althea
knollys
had
awakened
the
birds
of
the
air
xxxiii
lucetta
the
next
morning
i
rose
with
the
lark
i
had
slept
well
and
all
my
old
vigor
had
returned
a
new
problem
was
before
me
a
problem
of
surpassing
interest
now
that
the
knollys
family
had
been
eliminated
from
the
list
of
persons
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
police
mother
jane
and
the
jewels
were
to
be
gryce
for
future
investigation
should
they
be
mine
my
decision
on
this
point
halted
and
thinking
it
might
be
helped
by
a
breath
of
fresh
air
i
decided
upon
an
early
stroll
as
a
means
of
settling
this
momentous
question
there
was
silence
in
the
house
when
i
passed
through
it
on
my
way
to
the
front
door
but
that
silence
had
lost
its
terrors
and
the
old
house
its
absorbing
mystery
yet
it
was
not
robbed
of
its
interest
when
i
realized
that
althea
knollys
the
althea
of
my
youth
had
just
died
within
its
walls
as
ignorant
of
my
proximity
as
i
of
hers
i
felt
that
no
romance
nor
any
terror
brought
by
flitting
ghost
or
stalking
apparition
could
compare
with
the
wonder
of
this
return
and
the
strange
and
thrilling
circumstances
which
had
attended
it
and
the
end
was
not
yet
peaceful
as
everything
now
looked
i
still
felt
that
the
end
had
not
come
the
fact
that
saracen
was
loose
in
the
yard
gave
me
some
slight
concern
as
i
opened
the
great
front
door
and
looked
out
but
the
control
under
which
i
had
held
him
the
day
before
encouraged
me
in
my
venture
and
after
a
few
words
with
hannah
who
was
careful
not
to
let
me
slip
away
unnoticed
i
boldly
stepped
forth
and
took
my
solitary
way
down
to
the
gate
it
was
not
yet
eight
and
the
grass
was
still
heavy
with
dew
at
the
gate
i
paused
i
wished
to
go
farther
but
gryce
injunction
had
been
imperative
about
venturing
into
the
lane
alone
besides
no
that
was
not
a
horse
hoof
there
could
be
no
one
on
the
road
so
early
as
this
i
was
alarming
myself
unnecessarily
yet
well
i
held
my
place
a
little
awkwardly
perhaps
is
always
awkward
and
i
could
not
help
being
a
trifle
at
a
meeting
so
unexpected
and
but
the
more
i
attempt
to
explain
the
more
confused
my
expressions
become
so
i
will
just
say
that
by
this
very
strange
chance
i
was
leaning
over
the
gate
when
trohm
rode
up
for
the
second
time
and
found
me
there
i
did
not
attempt
any
excuses
he
is
gentleman
enough
to
understand
that
a
woman
of
my
temperament
rises
early
and
must
have
the
morning
air
that
he
should
feel
the
same
necessity
is
a
coincidence
natural
perhaps
but
still
a
coincidence
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
about
it
but
had
there
been
i
would
not
have
spoken
for
he
seemed
so
gratified
at
finding
me
enjoying
nature
at
this
early
hour
that
any
words
from
me
would
have
been
quite
superfluous
he
did
not
dismount
that
would
have
shown
intention
but
he
stopped
and
well
we
have
both
passed
the
age
of
romance
and
what
he
said
can
not
be
of
interest
to
the
general
public
especially
as
it
did
not
deal
with
the
disappearances
or
with
the
discoveries
made
in
the
knollys
house
the
day
before
or
with
any
of
those
questions
which
have
absorbed
our
attention
up
to
this
time
that
we
were
engaged
more
than
five
minutes
in
this
conversation
i
can
not
believe
i
have
always
been
extremely
accurate
in
regard
to
time
yet
a
good
was
lost
by
me
that
morning
for
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
account
perhaps
it
was
spent
in
the
short
discussion
which
terminated
our
interview
a
discussion
which
may
be
of
interest
to
you
for
it
was
upon
the
action
of
the
police
nothing
came
of
the
investigations
made
by
gryce
yesterday
i
perceive
trohm
had
remarked
with
some
reluctance
as
he
gathered
up
his
reins
to
depart
well
that
is
not
strange
how
could
he
have
hoped
to
find
any
clue
to
such
a
mystery
as
he
is
engaged
to
unearth
in
a
house
presided
over
by
miss
knollys
how
could
he
indeed
yet
i
added
determined
to
allay
this
suspicions
which
notwithstanding
the
openness
of
his
remark
were
still
observable
in
his
tones
you
say
that
with
an
air
i
should
hardly
expect
from
so
good
a
neighbor
and
friend
why
is
this
trohm
surely
you
do
not
associate
crime
with
the
misses
knollys
crime
oh
no
certainly
not
no
one
could
associate
crime
with
the
misses
knollys
if
my
tone
was
at
fault
it
was
due
perhaps
to
my
embarrassment
this
meeting
your
kindness
the
beauty
of
the
day
and
the
feeling
these
all
call
forth
well
i
may
be
pardoned
if
my
tones
are
not
quite
true
in
discussing
other
topics
my
thoughts
were
with
the
one
i
addressed
then
that
tone
of
doubt
was
all
the
more
misplaced
i
retorted
i
am
so
frank
i
can
not
bear
innuendo
in
others
besides
trohm
the
worst
folly
of
this
home
was
laid
bare
yesterday
in
a
way
to
set
at
rest
all
darker
suspicions
you
knew
that
william
indulged
in
vivisection
well
that
is
bad
but
it
can
not
be
called
criminal
let
us
do
him
justice
then
and
for
his
sisters
sake
see
how
we
can
him
in
the
good
graces
of
the
community
but
trohm
who
for
all
our
short
acquaintance
was
not
without
a
very
decided
appreciation
for
certain
points
in
my
character
shook
his
head
and
with
a
smiling
air
returned
you
are
asking
the
impossible
not
only
of
the
community
but
yourself
william
can
never
himself
he
is
of
too
rude
a
make
the
girls
may
recover
the
esteem
they
seem
to
have
lost
but
william
why
if
the
cause
of
those
disappearances
was
found
and
found
at
the
remotest
end
of
this
road
or
even
up
in
the
mountains
where
no
one
seems
to
have
looked
for
it
william
would
still
be
known
throughout
the
county
as
a
rough
and
cruel
man
i
have
tried
to
stand
his
friend
but
it
been
against
odds
miss
butterworth
even
his
sisters
recognize
this
and
show
their
lack
of
confidence
in
our
friendship
but
i
would
like
to
oblige
you
i
knew
he
ought
to
go
i
knew
that
if
he
had
simply
lingered
the
five
minutes
which
common
courtesy
allowed
that
curious
eyes
would
be
looking
from
loreen
window
and
that
at
any
minute
i
might
expect
some
interference
from
lucetta
who
had
read
through
this
man
forbearance
toward
william
the
very
natural
distrust
he
could
not
but
feel
toward
so
uncertain
a
character
yet
with
such
an
opportunity
at
my
command
how
could
i
let
him
go
without
another
question
trohm
said
i
you
have
the
kindest
heart
and
the
closest
lips
but
have
you
ever
thought
that
deacon
spear
he
stopped
me
with
a
really
horrified
look
deacon
spear
house
was
thoroughly
examined
yesterday
said
he
as
mine
will
be
insinuate
anything
against
him
leave
that
for
foolish
william
then
with
the
most
charming
return
to
his
old
manner
for
i
felt
myself
in
a
measure
rebuked
he
lifted
his
hat
and
urged
his
horse
forward
but
having
withdrawn
himself
a
step
or
two
he
paused
and
with
the
slightest
gesture
toward
the
little
hut
he
was
facing
added
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
any
he
had
yet
used
besides
deacon
spear
is
much
too
far
away
from
mother
jane
cottage
do
you
remember
that
i
told
you
she
never
could
be
got
to
go
more
than
forty
rods
from
her
own
doorstep
and
breaking
into
a
quick
canter
he
rode
away
i
was
left
to
think
over
his
words
and
the
impossibility
of
my
picking
up
any
other
clue
than
that
given
me
by
gryce
i
was
turning
toward
the
house
when
i
heard
a
slight
noise
at
my
feet
looking
down
i
encountered
the
eyes
of
saracen
he
was
crouching
at
my
side
and
as
i
turned
toward
him
his
tail
actually
wagged
it
was
a
sight
to
call
the
color
up
to
my
cheek
not
that
i
blushed
at
this
sign
of
astonishing
as
it
was
considering
my
feeling
toward
dogs
but
at
his
being
there
at
all
without
my
knowing
it
so
palpable
a
proof
that
no
woman
i
make
no
exceptions
can
listen
more
than
one
minute
to
the
expressions
of
a
man
sincere
admiration
without
losing
a
little
of
her
watchfulness
was
not
to
be
disregarded
by
one
as
inexorable
to
her
own
mistakes
as
to
those
of
others
i
saw
myself
the
victim
of
vanity
and
while
somewhat
abashed
by
the
discovery
i
could
not
but
realize
that
this
solitary
proof
of
feminine
weakness
was
not
really
to
be
deplored
in
one
who
has
not
yet
passed
the
line
beyond
which
any
such
display
is
ridiculous
lucetta
met
me
at
the
door
just
as
i
had
expected
her
to
giving
me
a
short
look
she
spoke
eagerly
but
with
a
latent
anxiety
for
which
i
was
more
or
less
prepared
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
bright
this
morning
she
declared
we
are
all
feeling
better
now
that
the
incubus
of
secrecy
is
removed
but
here
she
hesitated
i
would
not
like
to
think
you
told
trohm
what
happened
to
us
yesterday
lucetta
said
i
there
may
be
women
of
my
age
who
delight
in
gossiping
about
family
affairs
with
comparative
strangers
but
i
am
not
that
kind
of
woman
trohm
friendly
as
he
has
proved
himself
and
worthy
as
he
undoubtedly
is
of
your
confidence
and
trust
will
have
to
learn
from
some
other
person
than
myself
anything
which
you
may
wish
to
have
withheld
from
him
for
reply
she
gave
me
an
impulsive
kiss
i
thought
i
could
trust
you
she
cried
then
with
a
dubious
look
half
daring
half
shrinking
she
added
when
you
come
to
know
and
like
us
better
you
will
not
care
so
much
to
talk
to
neighbors
they
never
can
understand
us
or
do
us
justice
trohm
especially
this
was
a
remark
i
could
not
let
pass
why
i
demanded
why
do
you
think
trohm
cherishes
such
animosity
towards
you
has
he
ever
but
lucetta
could
exercise
a
repellent
dignity
when
she
chose
i
did
not
finish
my
sentence
though
i
must
have
looked
the
inquiry
i
thought
better
not
to
put
into
words
trohm
is
a
man
of
blameless
reputation
she
avowed
if
he
has
allowed
himself
to
cherish
suspicions
in
our
regard
he
has
doubtless
had
his
reasons
for
it
and
with
these
quiet
words
she
left
me
to
my
thoughts
and
i
must
say
to
my
doubts
which
were
all
the
more
painful
that
i
saw
no
immediate
opportunity
for
clearing
them
up
late
in
the
afternoon
william
burst
in
with
news
from
the
other
end
of
the
lane
such
a
lark
he
cried
the
investigation
at
deacon
spear
house
was
a
mere
farce
and
i
just
made
them
repeat
it
with
a
few
frills
they
had
dug
up
my
cellar
and
i
was
determined
they
should
dig
up
his
oh
the
fun
it
was
the
old
fellow
kicked
but
i
had
my
way
they
refuse
me
you
know
i
had
refused
them
so
that
man
has
had
a
stir
up
they
did
find
anything
but
it
did
me
a
lot
of
good
and
that
something
i
do
hate
deacon
spear
could
hate
him
worse
if
he
killed
and
buried
ten
men
under
his
hearthstone
there
is
no
harm
in
deacon
spear
said
lucetta
quickly
did
they
submit
trohm
house
to
a
search
also
asked
loreen
ashamed
of
william
heat
and
anxious
to
avert
any
further
display
of
it
yes
they
went
through
that
too
i
was
with
them
glad
i
was
too
i
say
girls
i
could
have
laughed
to
see
all
the
comforts
that
old
bachelor
has
about
him
never
saw
such
fixings
why
that
house
is
as
neat
and
pretty
from
top
to
bottom
as
any
old
maid
it
silly
of
course
for
a
man
and
i
rather
live
in
an
old
rookery
like
this
where
i
can
walk
from
room
to
room
in
muddy
boots
if
i
want
to
and
train
my
dogs
and
live
in
freedom
like
the
man
i
am
yet
i
could
help
thinking
it
mighty
comfortable
too
for
an
old
fellow
like
him
who
likes
such
things
and
do
have
chick
or
child
to
meddle
why
he
had
pincushions
on
all
his
bureaus
and
they
had
pins
in
them
the
laugh
with
which
he
delivered
this
last
sentence
might
have
been
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
lucetta
looked
at
loreen
and
loreen
looked
at
me
but
none
of
us
joined
in
the
mirth
which
seemed
to
me
very
suddenly
lucetta
asked
did
they
dig
up
trohm
cellar
william
stopped
laughing
long
enough
to
say
his
cellar
why
it
cemented
as
hard
as
an
oak
floor
no
they
polish
their
spades
in
his
house
which
was
another
source
of
satisfaction
to
me
deacon
spear
has
even
that
to
comfort
him
oh
how
i
did
enjoy
that
old
fellow
face
when
they
began
to
root
up
his
old
fungi
lucetta
turned
away
with
a
certain
odd
constraint
i
could
not
but
notice
it
a
humiliating
day
for
the
lane
said
she
and
what
is
worse
she
suddenly
added
nothing
will
ever
come
of
it
it
will
take
more
than
a
band
of
police
to
reach
the
root
of
this
matter
i
thought
her
manner
odd
and
moving
towards
her
took
her
by
the
hand
with
something
of
a
relative
familiarity
what
makes
you
say
that
gryce
seems
a
very
capable
man
yes
yes
but
capability
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
chance
might
and
pluck
might
but
wit
and
experience
not
otherwise
the
mystery
would
have
been
settled
long
ago
i
wish
i
well
her
hand
was
trembling
violently
nothing
i
do
know
why
i
have
allowed
myself
to
talk
on
this
subject
loreen
and
i
once
made
a
compact
never
to
give
any
opinion
upon
it
you
see
how
i
have
kept
it
she
had
drawn
her
hand
away
and
suddenly
had
become
quite
composed
i
turned
my
attention
toward
loreen
but
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
showed
no
intention
of
further
pursuing
the
conversation
william
had
strolled
out
well
said
i
if
ever
a
girl
had
reason
for
breaking
such
a
compact
you
are
certainly
that
girl
i
could
never
have
been
as
silent
as
you
have
been
that
is
if
i
had
any
suspicions
on
so
serious
a
subject
why
your
own
good
name
is
impugned
yours
and
that
of
every
other
person
living
in
this
lane
miss
butterworth
she
replied
i
have
gone
too
far
besides
you
have
misunderstood
me
i
have
no
more
knowledge
than
anybody
else
as
to
the
source
of
these
terrible
tragedies
i
only
know
that
an
almost
superhuman
cunning
lies
at
the
bottom
of
so
many
unaccountable
disappearances
a
cunning
so
great
that
only
a
crazy
person
ah
i
murmured
eagerly
mother
jane
she
did
not
answer
instantly
i
took
a
resolution
lucetta
said
i
is
deacon
spear
a
rich
man
starting
violently
she
looked
at
me
amazed
if
he
is
i
should
like
to
hazard
the
guess
that
he
is
the
man
who
has
held
you
in
such
thraldom
for
years
and
if
he
were
said
she
i
could
understand
william
antipathy
to
him
and
also
his
suspicions
she
gave
me
a
strange
look
then
without
answering
walked
over
and
took
loreen
by
the
hand
hush
i
thought
i
heard
her
whisper
at
all
events
the
two
sisters
were
silent
for
more
than
a
moment
then
lucetta
said
deacon
spear
is
well
off
but
nothing
will
ever
make
me
accuse
living
man
of
crime
so
dreadful
and
she
walked
away
drawing
loreen
after
her
in
another
moment
she
was
out
of
the
room
leaving
me
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
this
girl
holds
the
secret
to
the
whole
situation
i
inwardly
decided
the
belief
that
nothing
more
can
be
learned
from
her
is
a
false
one
i
must
see
gryce
william
rodomontades
are
so
much
empty
air
but
lucetta
silence
has
a
meaning
we
can
not
afford
to
ignore
so
impressed
was
i
by
this
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
which
presented
itself
of
seeing
the
detective
this
was
early
the
next
morning
he
and
several
of
the
townspeople
had
made
their
appearance
at
mother
jane
cottage
with
spades
and
picks
and
the
sight
had
naturally
drawn
us
all
down
to
the
gate
where
we
stood
watching
operations
in
a
silence
which
would
have
been
considered
unnatural
by
any
one
who
did
not
realize
the
conflicting
nature
of
the
emotions
underlying
it
william
to
whom
the
death
of
his
mother
seemed
to
be
a
great
deliverance
had
been
inclined
to
be
more
or
less
jocular
but
his
sallies
meeting
with
no
response
he
had
sauntered
away
to
have
it
out
with
his
dogs
leaving
me
alone
with
the
two
girls
and
hannah
the
latter
seemed
to
be
absorbed
entirely
by
the
aspect
of
mother
jane
who
stood
upon
her
doorstep
in
an
attitude
so
menacing
that
it
was
little
short
of
tragic
her
hood
for
the
first
time
in
the
memory
of
those
present
had
fallen
away
from
her
head
revealing
a
wealth
of
gray
hair
which
flew
away
from
her
head
like
a
weird
halo
her
features
we
could
not
distinguish
but
the
emotion
which
inspired
her
breathed
in
every
gesture
of
her
uplifted
arms
and
swaying
body
it
was
wrath
personified
and
yet
an
unreasoning
wrath
one
could
see
she
was
as
much
dazed
as
outraged
her
lares
and
penates
were
being
attacked
and
she
had
come
from
the
heart
of
her
solitude
to
defend
them
i
declare
hannah
protested
it
is
pitiful
she
has
nothing
in
the
world
but
that
garden
and
now
they
are
going
to
root
that
up
do
you
think
that
the
sight
of
a
little
money
would
appease
her
i
inquired
anxious
for
an
excuse
to
drop
a
word
into
the
ear
of
gryce
perhaps
said
hannah
she
dearly
loves
money
but
it
will
not
take
away
her
fright
it
will
if
she
has
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
said
i
and
turning
to
the
girls
i
asked
them
somewhat
mincingly
for
me
if
they
thought
i
would
make
myself
conspicuous
if
i
crossed
the
road
on
this
errand
and
when
loreen
answered
that
that
would
not
deter
her
if
she
had
the
money
and
lucetta
added
that
the
sight
of
such
misery
was
too
painful
for
any
mere
personal
consideration
i
took
advantage
of
their
complaisance
and
hastily
made
my
way
over
to
the
group
who
were
debating
as
to
the
point
they
would
attack
first
gentlemen
said
i
i
am
here
on
an
errand
of
mercy
poor
old
mother
jane
is
half
imbecile
and
does
not
understand
why
you
invade
her
premises
with
these
implements
will
you
object
if
i
endeavor
to
distract
her
mind
with
a
little
piece
of
gold
i
happen
to
have
in
my
pocket
she
may
not
deserve
it
but
it
will
make
your
task
easier
and
save
us
some
possible
concern
half
of
the
men
at
once
took
off
their
hats
the
other
half
nudged
each
other
elbows
and
whispered
and
grimaced
like
the
fools
they
were
the
first
half
were
gentlemen
though
not
all
of
them
wore
clothes
it
was
gryce
who
spoke
certainly
madam
give
the
old
woman
anything
you
please
but
and
here
he
stepped
up
to
me
and
began
to
whisper
you
have
something
to
say
what
is
it
i
answered
in
the
same
quick
way
the
mine
you
thought
exhausted
has
possibilities
in
it
yet
question
lucetta
it
may
prove
a
more
fruitful
task
than
turning
up
this
soil
the
bow
he
made
was
more
for
the
onlookers
than
for
the
suggestion
i
had
given
him
yet
he
was
not
ungrateful
for
the
latter
as
i
who
was
beginning
to
understand
him
could
see
be
as
generous
as
you
please
he
cried
aloud
we
would
not
disturb
the
old
crone
if
it
were
not
for
one
of
her
follies
nothing
will
take
her
over
forty
rods
away
from
her
home
now
what
lies
within
those
forty
rods
these
men
think
we
ought
to
see
the
shrug
i
gave
answered
both
the
apparent
and
the
concealed
question
satisfied
that
he
would
understand
it
so
i
hurried
away
from
him
and
approached
mother
jane
see
said
i
astonished
at
the
regularity
of
her
features
now
that
i
had
a
good
opportunity
of
observing
them
i
have
brought
you
money
let
them
dig
up
your
turnips
if
they
will
she
did
not
seem
to
perceive
me
her
eyes
were
wild
with
dismay
and
her
lips
trembling
with
a
passion
far
beyond
my
power
to
comfort
lizzie
she
cried
lizzie
she
will
come
back
and
find
no
home
oh
my
poor
girl
my
poor
poor
girl
it
was
pitiable
i
could
not
doubt
her
anguish
or
her
sincerity
the
delirium
of
a
broken
heart
can
not
be
simulated
and
this
heart
was
not
controlled
by
reason
that
was
equally
apparent
immediately
my
heart
which
goes
out
slowly
but
none
the
less
truly
on
that
account
was
touched
by
something
more
than
the
surface
sympathy
of
the
moment
she
may
have
stolen
she
may
have
done
worse
she
may
even
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
horrible
crimes
which
have
given
its
name
to
the
lane
we
were
in
but
her
acts
if
acts
they
were
were
the
result
of
a
clouded
mind
fixed
forever
upon
the
fancied
needs
of
another
and
not
the
expression
of
personal
turpitude
or
even
of
personal
longing
or
avarice
therefore
i
could
pity
her
and
i
did
making
another
appeal
i
pressed
the
coin
hard
into
one
of
her
hands
till
the
contact
effected
what
my
words
had
been
unable
to
do
and
she
finally
looked
down
and
saw
what
she
was
clutching
then
indeed
her
aspect
changed
and
in
a
few
minutes
of
slowly
growing
comprehension
she
became
so
quiet
and
absorbed
that
she
forgot
to
look
at
the
men
and
even
forgot
me
who
was
probably
nothing
more
than
a
flitting
shadow
to
her
a
silk
gown
she
murmured
it
will
buy
lizzie
a
silk
gown
oh
where
did
it
come
from
the
good
good
gold
the
beautiful
gold
such
a
little
piece
yet
enough
to
make
her
look
fine
my
lizzie
my
pretty
pretty
lizzie
no
numbers
this
time
the
gift
was
too
overpowering
for
her
even
to
remember
that
it
must
be
hidden
away
i
walked
away
while
her
delight
was
still
voluble
somehow
it
eased
my
mind
to
have
done
her
this
little
act
of
kindness
and
i
think
it
eased
the
minds
of
the
men
too
at
all
events
every
hat
was
off
when
i
repassed
them
on
my
way
back
to
the
knollys
gateway
i
had
left
both
the
girls
there
but
i
found
only
one
awaiting
me
lucetta
had
gone
in
and
so
had
hannah
on
what
errand
i
was
soon
to
know
what
do
you
suppose
that
detective
wants
of
lucetta
now
asked
loreen
as
i
took
my
station
again
at
her
side
while
you
were
talking
to
mother
jane
he
stepped
over
here
and
with
a
word
or
two
induced
lucetta
to
walk
away
with
him
toward
the
house
see
there
they
are
in
those
thick
shrubs
near
the
right
wing
he
seems
to
be
pleading
with
her
do
you
think
i
ought
to
join
them
and
find
out
what
he
is
urging
upon
her
so
earnestly
i
do
like
to
seem
intrusive
but
lucetta
is
easily
agitated
you
know
and
his
business
can
not
be
of
an
indifferent
nature
after
all
he
has
discovered
concerning
our
affairs
no
i
agreed
and
yet
i
think
lucetta
will
be
strong
enough
to
sustain
the
conversation
judging
from
the
very
erect
attitude
she
is
holding
now
perhaps
he
thinks
she
can
tell
him
where
to
dig
they
seem
a
little
at
sea
over
there
and
living
as
you
do
a
few
rods
from
mother
jane
he
may
imagine
that
lucetta
can
direct
him
where
to
first
plant
the
spade
it
an
insult
loreen
protested
all
these
talks
and
visits
are
insults
to
be
sure
this
detective
has
some
excuse
but
keep
your
eye
on
lucetta
i
interrupted
she
is
shaking
her
head
and
looking
very
positive
she
will
prove
to
him
it
is
an
insult
we
need
not
interfere
i
think
but
loreen
had
grown
pensive
and
did
not
heed
my
suggestion
a
look
that
was
almost
wistful
had
supplanted
the
expression
of
indignant
revolt
with
which
she
had
addressed
me
and
when
next
moment
the
two
we
had
been
watching
turned
and
came
slowly
toward
us
it
was
with
decided
energy
she
bounded
forward
and
joined
them
what
is
the
matter
now
she
asked
what
does
gryce
want
lucetta
gryce
himself
spoke
i
simply
want
her
said
he
to
assist
me
with
a
clue
from
her
inmost
thoughts
when
i
was
in
your
house
he
explained
with
a
praiseworthy
consideration
for
me
and
my
relations
to
these
girls
for
which
i
can
not
be
too
grateful
i
saw
in
this
young
lady
something
which
convinced
me
that
as
a
dweller
in
this
lane
she
was
not
without
her
suspicions
as
to
the
secret
cause
of
the
fatal
mysteries
which
i
have
been
sent
here
to
clear
up
i
have
frankly
accused
her
of
this
and
asked
her
to
confide
in
me
but
she
refuses
to
do
so
miss
loreen
yet
her
face
shows
even
at
this
moment
that
my
old
eyes
were
not
at
fault
in
my
reading
of
her
she
does
suspect
somebody
and
it
is
not
mother
jane
how
can
you
say
that
began
lucetta
but
the
eyes
which
loreen
that
moment
turned
upon
her
seemed
to
trouble
her
for
she
did
not
attempt
to
say
any
more
only
looked
equally
obstinate
and
distressed
if
lucetta
suspects
any
one
loreen
now
steadily
remarked
then
i
think
she
ought
to
tell
you
who
it
is
you
do
then
perhaps
you
commenced
gryce
can
persuade
her
as
to
her
duty
he
finished
as
he
saw
her
head
rise
in
protest
of
what
he
evidently
had
intended
to
demand
lucetta
will
not
yield
to
persuasion
was
her
quiet
reply
nothing
short
of
conviction
will
move
the
but
the
most
determined
of
all
my
mother
children
what
she
thinks
is
right
she
will
do
i
will
not
attempt
to
influence
her
gryce
with
one
comprehensive
survey
of
the
two
hesitated
no
longer
i
saw
the
rising
of
the
blood
into
his
forehead
which
always
precedes
the
beginning
of
one
of
his
great
moves
and
filled
with
a
sudden
excitement
i
awaited
his
next
words
as
a
tyro
awaits
the
first
unfolding
of
the
plan
he
has
seen
working
in
the
brain
of
some
famous
strategist
miss
lucetta
his
very
tone
was
changed
changed
in
a
way
to
make
us
all
start
notwithstanding
the
preparation
his
momentary
silence
had
given
us
i
have
been
thus
pressing
and
perhaps
rude
in
my
appeal
because
of
something
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
which
can
not
but
make
you
of
all
persons
extremely
anxious
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
terrible
mystery
i
am
an
old
man
and
you
will
not
mind
my
bluntness
i
have
been
told
and
your
agitation
convinces
me
there
is
truth
in
the
report
that
you
have
a
lover
a
ostrander
ah
she
had
sunk
as
if
crushed
by
one
overwhelming
blow
to
the
earth
the
eyes
the
lips
the
whole
pitiful
face
that
was
upturned
to
us
remain
in
my
memory
as
the
most
terrible
and
yet
the
most
moving
spectacle
that
has
come
into
my
by
no
means
uneventful
life
what
has
happened
to
him
quick
quick
tell
me
for
answer
gryce
drew
out
a
telegram
from
the
master
of
the
ship
on
which
he
was
to
sail
he
explained
it
asks
if
ostrander
left
this
town
on
tuesday
last
as
no
news
has
been
received
of
him
loreen
loreen
when
he
left
us
he
passed
down
that
way
shrieked
the
girl
rising
like
a
spirit
and
pointing
east
toward
deacon
spear
he
is
gone
he
is
lost
but
his
fate
shall
not
remain
a
mystery
i
will
dare
its
solution
i
i
you
will
hear
from
me
again
and
without
another
glance
at
any
of
us
she
turned
and
fled
toward
the
house
xxxiv
conditions
but
in
another
moment
she
was
back
her
eyes
dilated
and
her
whole
person
exhaling
a
terrible
purpose
do
not
look
at
me
do
not
notice
me
she
cried
but
in
a
voice
so
hoarse
no
one
but
gryce
could
fully
understand
her
i
am
for
no
one
eyes
but
god
pray
that
he
may
have
mercy
upon
me
then
as
she
saw
us
all
instinctively
fall
back
she
controlled
herself
and
pointing
toward
mother
jane
cottage
said
more
distinctly
as
for
those
men
let
them
dig
let
them
dig
the
whole
day
long
secrecy
must
be
kept
a
secrecy
so
absolute
that
not
even
the
birds
of
the
air
must
see
that
our
thoughts
range
beyond
the
forty
rods
surrounding
mother
jane
cottage
she
turned
and
would
have
fled
away
for
the
second
time
but
gryce
stopped
her
you
have
set
yourself
a
task
beyond
your
strength
can
you
perform
it
i
can
perform
it
she
said
if
loreen
does
not
talk
and
i
am
allowed
to
spend
the
day
in
solitude
i
had
never
seen
gryce
so
agitated
no
not
when
he
left
olive
randolph
bedside
after
an
hour
of
vain
pleading
but
to
wait
all
day
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
wait
all
day
it
is
necessary
she
spoke
like
an
automaton
at
twilight
when
the
sun
is
setting
meet
me
at
the
great
tree
just
where
the
road
turns
not
a
minute
sooner
not
an
hour
later
i
will
be
calmer
then
and
waiting
now
for
nothing
not
for
a
word
from
loreen
nor
a
detaining
touch
from
gryce
she
flew
away
for
the
second
time
this
time
loreen
followed
her
well
that
is
the
hardest
thing
i
ever
had
to
do
said
gryce
wiping
his
forehead
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
real
grief
and
anxiety
do
you
think
her
delicate
frame
can
stand
it
will
she
survive
this
day
and
carry
through
whatever
it
is
she
has
set
herself
to
accomplish
she
has
no
organic
disease
said
i
but
she
loved
that
young
man
very
much
and
the
day
will
be
a
terrible
one
to
her
gryce
sighed
i
wish
i
had
not
been
obliged
to
resort
to
such
means
said
he
but
women
like
that
only
work
under
excitement
and
she
does
know
the
secret
of
this
affair
do
you
mean
i
demanded
almost
aghast
that
you
have
deceived
her
with
a
false
telegram
that
that
slip
of
paper
you
hold
read
it
he
cried
holding
it
out
toward
me
i
did
read
it
alas
there
was
no
deception
in
it
it
read
as
he
said
however
i
began
but
he
had
pocketed
the
telegram
and
was
several
steps
away
before
i
had
finished
my
sentence
i
am
going
to
start
these
men
up
said
he
you
will
breathe
no
word
to
miss
lucetta
of
my
sympathy
nor
let
your
own
interests
slack
in
the
investigations
which
are
going
on
under
our
noses
and
with
a
quick
sharp
bow
he
made
his
way
to
the
gate
whither
i
followed
him
in
time
to
see
him
set
his
foot
upon
a
patch
of
sage
you
will
begin
at
this
place
he
cried
and
work
east
and
gentlemen
something
tells
me
that
we
shall
be
successful
with
almost
a
simultaneous
sound
a
dozen
spades
and
picks
struck
the
ground
the
digging
up
of
mother
jane
garden
had
begun
in
earnest
xxxv
the
dove
i
remained
at
the
gate
i
had
been
bidden
to
show
my
interest
in
what
was
going
on
in
mother
jane
garden
and
this
was
the
way
i
did
it
but
my
thoughts
were
not
with
the
diggers
i
knew
as
well
then
as
later
that
they
would
find
nothing
worth
the
trouble
they
were
taking
and
having
made
up
my
mind
to
this
i
was
free
to
follow
the
lead
of
my
own
thoughts
they
were
not
happy
ones
i
was
neither
satisfied
with
myself
nor
with
the
prospect
of
the
long
day
of
cruel
suspense
that
awaited
us
when
i
undertook
to
come
to
it
was
with
the
latent
expectation
of
making
myself
useful
in
ferreting
out
its
mystery
and
how
had
i
succeeded
i
had
been
the
means
through
which
one
of
its
secrets
had
been
discovered
but
not
secret
and
while
gryce
was
good
enough
or
wise
enough
to
show
no
diminution
in
his
respect
for
me
i
knew
that
i
had
sunk
a
peg
in
his
estimation
from
the
consciousness
i
had
of
having
sunk
two
if
not
three
pegs
in
my
own
this
was
a
galling
thought
to
me
but
it
was
not
the
only
one
which
disturbed
me
happily
or
unhappily
i
have
as
much
heart
as
pride
and
lucetta
despair
and
the
desperate
resolve
to
which
it
had
led
had
made
an
impression
upon
me
which
i
could
not
shake
off
whether
she
knew
the
criminal
or
only
suspected
him
whether
in
the
heat
of
her
sudden
anguish
she
had
promised
more
or
less
than
she
could
perform
the
fact
remained
that
we
by
whom
i
mean
first
and
above
all
gryce
the
ablest
detective
on
the
new
york
force
and
myself
who
if
no
detective
am
at
least
a
factor
of
more
or
less
importance
in
an
inquiry
like
this
were
awaiting
the
action
of
a
weak
and
suffering
girl
to
discover
what
our
own
experience
should
be
able
to
obtain
for
us
unassisted
that
gryce
felt
that
he
was
playing
a
great
card
in
thus
enlisting
her
despair
in
our
service
did
not
comfort
me
i
am
not
fond
of
games
in
which
real
hearts
take
the
place
of
painted
ones
and
besides
i
was
not
ready
to
acknowledge
that
my
own
capacity
for
ferreting
out
this
mystery
was
quite
exhausted
or
that
i
ought
to
remain
idle
while
lucetta
bent
under
a
task
so
much
beyond
her
strength
so
deeply
was
i
impressed
by
this
latter
consideration
that
i
found
myself
even
in
the
midst
of
my
apparent
interest
in
what
was
going
on
at
mother
cottage
asking
if
i
was
bound
to
accept
the
defeat
pronounced
upon
my
efforts
by
gryce
and
if
there
was
not
yet
time
to
retrieve
myself
and
save
lucetta
one
happy
thought
or
clever
linking
of
cause
to
effect
might
lead
me
yet
to
the
clue
which
we
had
hitherto
sought
in
vain
and
then
who
would
have
more
right
to
triumph
than
amelia
butterworth
or
who
more
reason
to
apologize
than
ebenezar
gryce
but
where
was
i
to
get
my
happy
thought
and
by
what
stroke
of
fortune
could
i
reasonably
hope
to
light
upon
a
clue
which
had
escaped
the
penetrating
eye
of
my
quondam
colleague
lucetta
gesture
and
exclamation
he
passed
that
way
indicated
that
her
suspicions
pointed
in
the
direction
of
deacon
spear
cottage
so
did
william
wandering
accusations
but
this
was
little
help
to
me
confined
as
i
was
to
the
knollys
demesnes
both
by
gryce
command
and
by
my
own
sense
of
propriety
no
i
must
light
on
something
more
tangible
something
practical
enough
to
justify
me
in
my
own
eyes
for
any
interference
i
might
meditate
in
short
i
must
start
from
a
fact
and
not
from
a
suspicion
but
what
fact
why
there
was
but
one
and
that
was
the
finding
of
certain
indisputable
tokens
of
crime
in
mother
keeping
that
was
a
clue
a
clue
to
be
sure
which
gryce
while
ostensibly
following
it
in
his
present
action
really
felt
to
lead
nowhere
but
which
i
here
my
thoughts
paused
i
dare
not
promise
myself
too
satisfactory
results
to
my
efforts
even
while
conscious
of
that
vague
elation
which
presages
success
and
which
i
could
only
overcome
by
resorting
again
to
reasoning
this
time
i
started
with
a
question
had
mother
jane
committed
these
crimes
herself
i
did
not
think
so
neither
did
gryce
for
all
the
persistence
he
showed
in
having
the
ground
about
her
humble
turned
over
then
how
had
the
ring
of
chittenden
come
to
be
in
her
possession
when
as
all
agreed
she
never
was
known
to
wander
more
than
forty
rods
away
from
home
if
the
crime
by
which
this
young
gentleman
had
perished
had
taken
place
up
the
road
as
lucetta
denouncing
finger
plainly
indicated
then
this
token
of
mother
jane
complicity
in
it
had
been
carried
across
the
intervening
space
by
other
means
than
mother
jane
herself
in
other
words
it
was
brought
to
her
by
the
perpetrator
or
it
was
placed
where
she
could
lay
hand
on
it
neither
supposition
implying
guilt
on
her
part
she
being
in
all
probability
as
innocent
of
wrong
as
she
was
of
sense
at
all
events
such
should
be
my
theory
for
the
nonce
old
theories
having
exploded
or
become
of
little
avail
in
the
present
aspect
of
things
to
discover
then
the
source
of
crime
i
must
discover
the
means
by
which
this
ring
reached
mother
jane
an
almost
hopeless
task
but
not
to
be
despaired
of
on
that
account
had
i
not
wrung
the
truth
in
times
gone
by
from
that
piece
of
obstinate
stolidity
the
van
burnam
and
if
i
could
do
this
might
i
not
hope
to
win
an
equal
confidence
from
this
creature
with
a
heart
so
passionate
it
beat
to
but
one
tune
her
lizzie
i
meant
at
least
to
try
and
under
the
impulse
of
this
resolve
i
left
my
position
at
the
gate
and
recrossed
the
road
to
mother
jane
whose
figure
i
could
dimly
discern
on
the
farther
side
of
her
little
house
gryce
barely
looked
up
as
i
passed
him
and
the
men
not
at
all
they
were
deep
in
their
work
and
probably
did
not
see
me
neither
did
mother
jane
at
first
she
had
not
yet
wearied
of
the
shining
gold
she
held
though
she
had
begun
again
upon
that
chanting
of
numbers
the
secret
of
which
gryce
had
discovered
in
his
investigation
of
her
house
i
therefore
found
it
hard
to
make
her
hear
me
when
i
attempted
to
speak
she
had
fixed
upon
the
new
number
fifteen
and
seemed
never
to
tire
of
repeating
it
at
last
i
took
cue
from
her
speech
and
shouted
out
the
word
it
was
the
number
of
the
vegetable
in
which
ring
had
been
hidden
and
it
made
her
start
violently
ten
ten
i
reiterated
catching
her
eye
he
who
brought
it
has
carried
it
away
come
into
the
house
and
look
it
was
a
desperate
attempt
i
felt
myself
quake
inwardly
as
i
realized
how
near
gryce
was
standing
and
what
his
anger
would
be
if
he
surprised
me
at
this
move
after
he
had
cried
halt
but
neither
my
own
perturbation
nor
the
thought
of
his
possible
anger
could
restrain
the
spirit
of
investigation
which
had
returned
to
me
with
the
above
words
and
when
i
saw
that
they
had
not
fallen
upon
deaf
ears
but
that
mother
jane
heard
and
in
a
measure
understood
them
i
led
the
way
into
the
hut
and
pointed
to
the
string
from
which
the
one
precious
vegetable
had
been
torn
she
gave
a
spring
toward
it
that
was
maniacal
in
its
fury
and
for
an
instant
i
thought
she
was
going
to
rend
the
air
with
one
of
her
wild
yells
when
there
came
a
swishing
of
wings
at
one
of
the
open
windows
and
a
dove
flew
in
and
nestled
in
her
breast
diverting
her
attention
so
that
she
dropped
the
empty
husk
of
the
onion
she
had
just
grasped
and
seized
the
bird
in
its
stead
it
was
a
violent
clutch
so
violent
that
the
poor
dove
panted
and
struggled
under
it
till
its
head
flopped
over
and
i
looked
to
see
it
die
in
her
hands
stop
i
cried
horrified
at
a
sight
i
was
so
unprepared
to
expect
from
one
who
was
supposed
to
cherish
these
birds
most
tenderly
but
she
heard
me
no
more
than
she
saw
the
gesture
of
indignant
appeal
i
made
her
all
her
attention
as
well
as
all
her
fury
was
fixed
upon
the
dove
over
whose
neck
and
under
whose
wings
she
ran
her
trembling
fingers
with
the
desperation
of
one
looking
for
something
he
failed
to
find
ten
ten
it
was
now
her
turn
to
shout
as
her
eyes
passed
in
angry
menace
from
the
bird
to
the
empty
husk
that
dangled
over
her
head
you
brought
it
did
you
and
you
taken
it
have
you
there
then
never
bring
or
carry
any
more
and
lifting
up
her
hand
she
flung
the
bird
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
would
have
turned
upon
me
in
which
contingency
i
would
for
once
have
met
my
match
if
in
releasing
the
bird
from
her
hands
she
had
not
at
the
same
time
released
the
coin
which
she
had
hitherto
managed
to
hold
through
all
her
passionate
gestures
the
sight
of
this
piece
of
gold
which
she
had
evidently
forgotten
for
the
moment
turned
her
thoughts
back
to
the
joys
it
promised
her
recapturing
it
once
more
she
sank
again
into
her
old
ecstasy
upon
which
i
proceeded
to
pick
up
the
poor
senseless
dove
and
leave
the
hut
with
a
devout
feeling
of
gratitude
for
my
undoubted
escape
that
i
did
this
quietly
and
with
the
dove
hidden
under
my
little
cape
no
one
who
knows
me
well
will
doubt
i
had
brought
something
from
the
hut
besides
this
victim
of
the
old
imbecile
fury
and
i
was
no
more
willing
that
gryce
should
see
the
one
than
detect
the
other
i
had
brought
away
a
clue
the
birds
of
the
air
shall
carry
it
so
the
scripture
runs
this
bird
this
pigeon
who
now
lay
panting
out
his
life
in
my
arms
had
brought
her
the
ring
which
in
gryce
eyes
had
seemed
to
connect
her
with
the
disappearance
of
young
chittenden
xxxvi
an
hour
of
startling
experiences
not
till
i
was
safely
back
in
the
knollys
grounds
not
indeed
till
i
had
put
one
or
two
large
and
healthy
shrubs
between
me
and
a
certain
pair
of
very
prying
eyes
did
i
bring
the
dove
out
from
under
my
cape
and
examine
the
poor
bird
for
any
sign
which
might
be
of
help
to
me
in
the
search
to
which
i
was
newly
committed
but
i
found
nothing
and
was
obliged
to
resort
to
my
old
plan
of
reasoning
to
make
anything
out
of
the
situation
in
which
i
thus
so
unexpectedly
found
myself
the
dove
had
brought
the
ring
into
old
mother
jane
hands
but
whence
and
through
whose
agency
this
was
as
much
a
secret
as
before
but
the
longer
i
contemplated
it
the
more
i
realized
that
it
need
not
remain
a
secret
long
that
we
had
simply
to
watch
the
other
doves
note
where
they
lighted
and
in
whose
they
were
welcome
for
us
to
draw
inferences
that
might
lead
to
revelations
before
the
day
was
out
if
deacon
spear
but
deacon
spear
house
had
been
examined
as
well
as
that
of
every
other
resident
in
the
lane
this
i
knew
but
it
had
not
been
examined
by
me
and
unwilling
as
i
was
to
challenge
the
accuracy
or
thoroughness
of
a
search
led
on
by
such
a
man
as
gryce
i
could
not
but
feel
that
with
such
a
hint
as
i
had
received
from
the
episode
in
the
hut
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
to
submit
these
same
premises
to
my
own
somewhat
penetrating
survey
no
man
in
my
judgment
having
the
same
quickness
of
eyesight
in
matters
domestic
as
a
woman
trained
to
know
every
inch
of
a
house
and
to
measure
by
a
every
fall
of
drapery
within
it
but
how
in
the
name
of
goodness
was
i
to
obtain
an
opportunity
for
this
survey
had
we
not
one
and
all
been
bidden
to
confine
our
attention
to
what
was
going
on
in
mother
jane
cottage
and
would
it
not
be
treason
to
lucetta
to
run
the
least
risk
of
awakening
apprehension
in
any
possibly
guilty
mind
at
the
other
end
of
the
road
yes
but
for
all
that
i
could
not
keep
still
if
fate
or
my
own
ingenuity
offered
me
the
least
chance
of
pursuing
the
clue
i
had
wrung
from
our
imbecile
neighbor
at
the
risk
of
my
life
it
was
not
in
my
nature
to
do
so
any
more
than
it
was
in
my
nature
to
yield
up
my
present
advantage
to
gryce
without
making
a
personal
effort
to
utilize
it
i
forgot
that
i
failed
in
this
once
before
in
my
career
or
rather
i
recalled
this
failure
perhaps
and
felt
the
great
need
of
retrieving
myself
when
therefore
in
my
slow
stroll
towards
the
house
i
encountered
william
in
the
shrubbery
i
could
not
forbear
accosting
him
with
a
question
or
two
william
i
remarked
gently
rubbing
the
side
of
my
nose
with
an
irresolute
forefinger
and
looking
at
him
from
under
my
lids
that
was
a
scurvy
trick
you
played
deacon
spear
yesterday
he
stood
amazed
then
burst
into
one
of
his
loud
laughs
you
think
so
he
cried
well
i
do
he
only
got
what
he
deserved
the
hard
sanctimonious
sneak
do
you
say
that
i
inquired
with
some
spirit
because
you
dislike
the
man
or
because
you
really
believe
him
to
be
worthy
of
hatred
william
amusement
at
this
argued
little
for
my
hopes
are
very
much
interested
in
the
deacon
he
suggested
with
a
leer
which
insolence
i
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
because
it
best
suited
my
plan
you
have
not
answered
my
question
i
remarked
with
a
forced
air
of
anxiety
oh
no
he
cried
so
i
have
and
he
tried
to
look
serious
too
well
well
to
be
just
i
have
nothing
really
against
the
man
but
his
mean
ways
still
if
i
were
going
to
risk
my
life
on
a
hazard
as
to
who
is
the
evil
spirit
of
this
lane
i
should
say
spear
and
done
with
it
he
has
such
cursed
small
eyes
do
think
his
eyes
are
too
small
i
returned
loftily
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
i
suggested
anxiously
and
my
opinion
is
shared
by
your
sisters
they
evidently
think
very
well
of
him
oh
he
sneered
girls
are
no
judges
they
do
know
a
good
man
when
they
see
him
and
they
do
know
a
bad
you
must
go
by
what
they
say
i
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
ask
if
he
did
not
think
lucetta
sufficiently
understood
herself
to
be
trusted
in
what
she
contemplated
doing
that
night
but
this
was
neither
in
accordance
with
my
plan
nor
did
it
seem
quite
loyal
to
lucetta
who
so
far
as
i
knew
had
not
communicated
her
intentions
to
this
booby
brother
i
therefore
changed
this
question
into
a
repetition
of
my
first
remark
well
i
still
think
the
trick
you
played
deacon
spear
yesterday
a
poor
one
and
i
advise
you
as
a
gentleman
to
go
and
ask
his
pardon
this
was
such
a
preposterous
proposition
he
could
not
hold
his
peace
ask
his
pardon
he
snorted
well
saracen
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
of
that
ask
deacon
spear
pardon
for
obliging
him
to
be
treated
with
as
great
attention
as
i
had
been
myself
if
you
do
not
i
went
on
unmoved
i
shall
go
and
do
it
myself
i
think
that
is
what
my
friendship
for
you
warrants
i
am
determined
that
while
i
am
a
visitor
in
your
house
no
one
shall
be
able
to
pick
a
flaw
in
your
conduct
he
stared
as
he
might
well
do
tried
to
read
my
face
then
my
intentions
and
failing
to
do
both
which
was
not
strange
broke
into
noisy
mirth
oh
ho
he
laughed
so
that
is
your
game
is
it
well
i
never
saracen
miss
butterworth
wants
to
reform
me
wants
to
make
one
of
her
sleek
city
chaps
out
of
william
knollys
she
have
hard
work
of
it
wo
she
but
then
we
beginning
to
like
her
well
enough
to
let
her
try
miss
butterworth
i
go
with
you
to
deacon
spear
i
have
had
so
much
chance
for
fun
in
a
i
had
not
expected
such
success
and
was
duly
thankful
but
i
made
no
reference
to
it
aloud
on
the
contrary
i
took
his
complaisance
as
a
matter
of
course
and
hiding
all
token
of
triumph
suggested
quietly
that
we
should
make
as
little
ado
as
possible
over
our
errand
seeing
that
gryce
was
something
of
a
meddler
and
take
it
into
his
head
to
interfere
which
suggestion
had
all
the
effect
i
anticipated
for
at
the
double
prospect
of
amusing
himself
at
the
deacon
expense
and
of
outwitting
the
man
whose
business
it
was
to
outwit
us
he
became
not
only
willing
but
eager
to
undertake
the
adventure
offered
him
so
with
the
understanding
that
i
was
to
be
ready
to
drive
into
town
as
soon
as
he
could
hitch
up
the
horse
we
parted
on
the
most
amicable
terms
he
proceeding
towards
the
stable
and
i
towards
the
house
where
i
hoped
to
learn
something
new
about
lucetta
but
loreen
from
whom
alone
i
could
hope
to
glean
any
information
was
shut
in
her
room
and
did
not
come
out
though
i
called
her
more
than
once
which
if
it
left
my
curiosity
unsatisfied
at
least
allowed
me
to
quit
the
house
without
awakening
hers
william
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
gate
when
i
descended
he
was
in
the
best
of
humors
and
helped
me
into
the
buggy
he
had
resurrected
from
some
corner
of
the
old
stable
with
a
grimace
of
suppressed
mirth
which
argued
well
for
the
peace
of
our
proposed
drive
the
horse
head
was
turned
away
from
the
quarter
we
were
bound
for
but
as
we
were
ostensibly
on
our
way
to
the
village
this
showed
but
common
prudence
on
william
part
and
as
such
met
with
my
entire
approbation
gryce
and
his
men
were
hard
at
work
when
we
passed
them
knowing
the
detective
so
well
and
rating
at
its
full
value
his
undoubted
talent
for
reading
the
motives
of
those
about
him
i
made
no
attempt
at
cajolery
in
the
explanation
i
proffered
of
our
sudden
departure
but
merely
said
in
my
old
peremptory
way
that
i
found
waiting
at
the
gate
so
tedious
that
i
had
accepted
william
invitation
to
drive
into
town
which
while
it
astonished
the
old
gentleman
did
not
really
arouse
his
suspicions
as
a
more
conciliatory
manner
and
speech
might
have
done
this
disposed
of
we
drove
rapidly
away
william
sense
of
humor
once
aroused
was
not
easily
allayed
he
seemed
so
pleased
with
his
errand
that
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
and
turned
the
subject
over
and
over
in
his
clumsy
way
till
i
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
seen
through
the
object
of
our
proposed
visit
and
was
making
the
butt
of
his
none
too
brilliant
wit
but
no
he
was
really
amused
at
the
part
he
was
called
upon
to
play
and
once
convinced
of
this
i
let
his
humor
run
on
without
check
till
we
had
lost
man
lane
from
the
other
end
and
were
in
sight
of
the
low
sloping
roof
of
deacon
spear
farmhouse
then
i
thought
it
time
to
speak
william
said
i
deacon
spear
is
too
good
a
man
and
as
i
take
it
is
in
possession
of
too
great
worldly
advantages
for
you
to
be
at
enmity
with
him
remember
that
he
is
a
neighbor
and
that
you
are
a
landed
proprietor
in
this
lane
good
for
you
was
the
elegant
reply
with
which
this
young
boor
honored
me
i
did
think
you
had
such
an
eye
for
the
main
chance
deacon
spear
is
rich
is
he
not
i
pursued
with
an
ulterior
motive
he
was
far
from
suspecting
rich
why
i
do
know
that
depends
upon
what
you
city
ladies
call
rich
should
call
him
so
but
then
as
you
say
i
am
a
landed
proprietor
myself
his
laugh
was
boisterously
loud
and
as
we
were
then
nearly
in
front
of
the
deacon
house
it
rang
in
through
the
open
windows
causing
such
surprise
that
more
than
one
head
bobbed
up
from
within
to
see
who
dared
to
laugh
like
that
in
lost
man
lane
while
i
noted
these
heads
and
various
other
small
matters
about
the
house
and
place
william
tied
up
the
horse
and
held
out
his
hand
for
me
to
descend
i
begin
to
suspect
he
whispered
as
he
helped
me
out
why
you
are
so
anxious
to
have
me
on
good
terms
with
the
deacon
at
which
insinuation
i
attempted
to
smile
but
only
succeeded
in
forcing
a
grim
twitch
or
two
to
my
lips
for
at
that
moment
and
before
i
could
take
one
step
towards
the
house
a
couple
of
pigeons
rose
up
from
behind
the
house
and
flew
away
in
a
for
mother
jane
cottage
ha
thought
i
my
instinct
has
not
failed
me
behold
the
link
between
this
house
and
the
hut
in
which
those
tokens
of
crime
were
found
and
was
for
the
moment
so
overwhelmed
by
this
confirmation
of
my
secret
suspicions
that
i
quite
forgot
to
advance
and
stood
stupidly
staring
after
these
birds
now
rapidly
disappearing
in
the
distance
william
voice
aroused
me
come
he
cried
do
be
bashful
i
do
think
much
of
deacon
spear
myself
but
if
do
why
what
the
matter
now
he
asked
with
a
startled
look
at
me
i
had
clutched
him
by
the
arm
nothing
i
protested
only
you
see
that
window
over
there
the
one
in
the
gable
of
the
barn
i
mean
i
thought
i
saw
a
hand
thrust
out
a
white
hand
that
dropped
crumbs
have
they
a
child
on
this
place
no
replied
william
in
an
odd
voice
and
with
an
odd
look
toward
the
window
i
have
mentioned
did
you
really
see
a
hand
there
i
most
certainly
did
i
answered
with
an
air
of
indifference
i
was
far
from
feeling
some
one
is
up
in
the
perhaps
it
is
deacon
spear
himself
if
so
he
will
have
to
come
down
for
now
that
we
are
here
i
am
determined
you
shall
do
your
duty
deacon
spear
ca
climb
that
was
the
perplexed
answer
i
received
in
a
hardly
intelligible
mutter
i
been
there
and
i
know
only
a
boy
or
a
very
agile
young
man
could
crawl
along
the
beams
that
lead
to
that
window
it
is
the
one
in
this
part
of
the
lane
and
when
i
said
yesterday
that
if
i
were
the
police
and
had
the
same
search
to
make
which
they
have
i
knew
where
i
would
look
i
meant
that
same
little
platform
up
behind
the
hay
whose
only
outlook
is
yonder
window
but
i
forgot
that
have
no
suspicions
of
our
good
deacon
that
are
here
on
quite
a
different
errand
than
to
search
for
silly
rufus
so
come
along
and
but
i
resisted
his
impelling
hand
he
was
so
much
in
earnest
and
so
evidently
under
the
excitement
of
what
appeared
to
him
a
great
discovery
that
he
seemed
quite
another
man
this
made
my
own
suspicions
less
hazardous
and
also
added
to
the
situation
fresh
difficulties
which
could
only
be
met
by
an
appearance
on
my
part
of
perfect
ingenuousness
turning
back
to
the
buggy
as
if
i
had
forgotten
something
and
thus
accounting
to
any
one
who
might
be
watching
us
for
the
delay
we
showed
in
entering
the
house
i
said
to
william
you
have
reasons
for
thinking
this
man
a
villain
or
you
would
be
so
ready
to
suspect
him
now
what
if
i
should
tell
you
that
i
agree
with
you
and
that
this
is
why
i
have
dragged
you
here
this
fine
morning
i
should
say
you
were
a
deuced
smart
woman
was
his
ready
answer
but
what
can
you
do
here
what
have
we
already
done
i
asked
discovered
that
they
have
some
one
in
hiding
in
what
you
call
an
inaccessible
place
in
the
barn
but
did
the
police
examine
the
whole
place
yesterday
they
certainly
told
me
they
had
searched
the
premises
thoroughly
yes
he
repeated
with
great
disdain
they
said
and
they
said
but
they
did
climb
up
to
the
one
in
sight
that
old
fellow
gryce
declared
it
was
worth
their
while
that
only
birds
could
reach
that
loophole
oh
i
returned
somewhat
taken
aback
you
called
his
attention
to
it
then
to
which
william
answered
with
a
vigorous
nod
and
the
grumbling
words
i
do
believe
in
the
police
i
think
they
often
in
league
with
the
very
rogues
they
but
here
the
necessity
of
approaching
the
house
became
too
apparent
for
further
delay
deacon
spear
had
shown
himself
at
the
front
door
and
the
sight
of
his
astonished
face
twisted
into
a
grimace
of
doubtful
welcome
drove
every
other
thought
away
than
how
we
were
to
acquit
ourselves
in
the
coming
interview
seeing
that
william
was
more
or
less
nonplussed
by
the
situation
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
whispering
let
us
keep
to
our
first
programme
led
him
up
the
walk
with
much
the
air
of
a
triumphant
captain
bringing
in
a
recalcitrant
prisoner
my
introduction
under
these
circumstances
can
be
imagined
by
those
who
have
followed
william
awkward
ways
but
the
deacon
who
was
probably
the
most
surprised
if
not
the
most
disconcerted
member
of
the
group
possessed
a
natural
fund
of
conceit
and
that
prevented
any
outward
manifestation
of
his
feelings
though
i
could
not
help
detecting
a
carefully
suppressed
antagonism
in
his
eye
when
he
allowed
it
to
fall
upon
william
which
warned
me
to
exercise
my
full
arts
in
the
manipulation
of
the
matter
before
me
i
accordingly
spoke
first
and
with
all
the
prim
courtesy
such
a
man
might
naturally
expect
from
an
intruder
of
my
sex
and
appearance
deacon
spear
said
i
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
in
his
stiff
parlor
you
are
astonished
to
see
us
here
no
doubt
especially
after
the
display
of
animosity
shown
towards
you
yesterday
by
this
graceless
young
friend
of
mine
but
it
is
on
account
of
this
unfortunate
occurrence
that
we
are
here
after
a
little
reflection
and
a
few
hints
i
may
add
from
one
who
has
seen
more
of
life
than
himself
william
felt
that
he
had
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
show
of
sport
in
yesterday
proceedings
and
accordingly
he
has
come
in
my
company
to
tender
his
apologies
and
entreat
your
forbearance
am
i
not
right
william
the
fellow
is
a
clown
under
all
and
every
circumstance
and
serious
as
our
real
purpose
was
and
dreadful
as
was
the
suspicion
he
professed
to
cherish
against
the
suave
and
seemingly
respectable
member
of
the
community
we
were
addressing
he
could
not
help
laughing
as
he
blunderingly
replied
that
you
are
miss
butterworth
she
always
right
deacon
i
did
act
like
a
fool
yesterday
and
seeming
to
think
that
with
this
one
sentence
he
had
played
his
part
out
to
perfection
he
jumped
up
and
strolled
out
of
the
house
almost
pushing
down
as
he
did
so
the
two
daughters
of
the
house
who
had
crept
into
the
hall
from
the
to
listen
well
well
exclaimed
the
deacon
you
have
done
wonders
miss
butterworth
to
bring
him
to
even
so
small
an
acknowledgment
as
that
he
a
vicious
one
is
william
knollys
and
if
were
not
such
a
lover
of
peace
and
concord
he
should
not
long
be
the
only
aggressive
one
but
have
no
taste
for
strife
and
so
you
may
both
regard
his
apology
as
accepted
but
why
do
you
rise
madam
sit
down
i
pray
and
let
me
do
the
honors
martha
jemima
but
i
would
not
allow
him
to
summon
his
daughters
the
man
inspired
me
with
too
much
dislike
if
not
fear
besides
i
was
anxious
about
william
what
was
he
doing
and
of
what
blunder
might
he
not
be
guilty
without
my
judicious
guidance
i
am
obliged
to
you
i
returned
but
i
can
not
wait
to
meet
your
daughters
now
another
time
deacon
there
is
important
business
going
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
lane
and
william
presence
there
may
be
required
ah
he
observed
following
me
to
the
door
they
are
digging
up
mother
jane
garden
i
nodded
restraining
myself
with
difficulty
fool
work
he
muttered
then
with
a
curious
look
which
made
me
instinctively
draw
back
he
added
these
things
must
inconvenience
you
madam
i
wish
you
had
made
your
visit
to
the
lane
in
happier
times
there
was
a
smirk
on
his
face
which
made
him
positively
repellent
i
could
scarcely
bow
my
acknowledgments
his
look
and
attitude
made
the
interview
so
obnoxious
looking
about
for
william
i
stepped
down
from
the
stoop
the
deacon
followed
me
where
is
william
i
asked
the
deacon
ran
his
eye
over
the
place
and
suddenly
frowned
with
vexation
the
scapegrace
he
murmured
what
business
has
he
in
my
barn
i
immediately
forced
a
smile
which
in
days
long
past
i
almost
forgotten
them
now
used
to
do
some
execution
oh
he
a
boy
i
exclaimed
do
not
mind
his
pranks
i
pray
what
a
comfortable
place
you
have
here
instantly
a
change
passed
over
the
deacon
and
he
turned
to
me
with
an
air
of
great
interest
broken
now
and
then
by
an
uneasy
glance
behind
him
at
the
barn
i
am
glad
you
like
the
place
he
insinuated
keeping
close
at
my
side
as
i
stepped
somewhat
briskly
down
the
walk
it
is
a
nice
place
worthy
of
the
commendation
of
so
competent
a
judge
as
yourself
it
was
a
barren
farm
without
one
attractive
feature
i
have
lived
on
it
now
forty
years
of
them
with
my
beloved
wife
caroline
and
two
here
he
stopped
and
wiped
a
tear
from
the
dryest
eye
i
ever
saw
miss
butterworth
i
am
a
widower
i
hastened
my
steps
i
here
duly
and
with
the
strictest
regard
for
the
truth
aver
that
i
decidedly
hastened
my
steps
at
this
very
unnecessary
announcement
but
he
with
another
covert
glance
behind
him
towards
the
barn
from
which
to
my
surprise
and
increasing
anxiety
william
had
not
yet
emerged
kept
well
up
to
me
and
only
paused
when
i
paused
at
the
side
of
the
road
near
the
buggy
miss
butterworth
he
began
undeterred
by
the
air
of
dignity
i
assumed
i
have
been
thinking
that
your
visit
here
is
a
rebuke
to
my
unneighborliness
but
the
business
which
has
occupied
the
lane
these
last
few
days
has
put
us
all
into
such
a
state
of
unpleasantness
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
sociability
his
voice
was
so
smooth
his
eyes
so
small
and
twinkling
that
if
i
could
have
thought
of
anything
except
william
possible
discoveries
in
the
barn
i
should
have
taken
delight
in
measuring
my
wits
against
his
egotism
but
as
it
was
i
said
nothing
possibly
because
i
only
half
heard
what
he
was
saying
i
am
no
lady
man
these
were
the
next
words
i
heard
but
then
i
judge
you
not
anxious
for
flattery
but
prefer
the
square
thing
uttered
by
a
square
man
without
delay
or
circumlocution
madam
i
am
and
i
have
been
a
widower
two
years
i
am
not
fitted
for
a
solitary
life
and
i
am
fitted
for
the
companionship
of
an
affectionate
wife
who
will
keep
my
hearth
clean
and
my
affections
in
good
working
order
will
you
be
that
wife
you
see
my
home
here
his
eye
stole
behind
him
with
that
uneasy
look
towards
the
barn
which
presence
in
it
certainly
warranted
a
home
which
i
can
offer
you
unencumbered
if
you
desire
to
live
in
lost
man
lane
i
put
in
subduing
both
my
surprise
and
my
disgust
at
this
preposterous
proposal
in
order
to
throw
all
the
sarcasm
of
which
i
was
capable
into
this
single
sentence
oh
he
exclaimed
you
do
like
the
neighborhood
well
we
could
go
elsewhere
i
am
not
set
against
the
city
myself
astounded
at
his
presumption
regarding
him
as
a
possible
criminal
who
was
endeavoring
to
beguile
me
for
purposes
of
his
own
i
could
no
longer
repress
either
my
indignation
or
the
wrath
with
which
such
impromptu
addresses
naturally
inspired
me
cutting
him
short
with
a
gesture
which
made
him
open
his
small
eyes
i
exclaimed
in
continuation
of
his
remark
nor
as
i
take
it
are
you
set
against
the
comfortable
little
income
somebody
has
told
you
i
possessed
i
see
your
disinterestedness
deacon
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
profit
by
it
why
man
i
never
spoke
to
you
before
in
my
life
and
do
you
think
oh
he
suavely
insinuated
with
a
suppressed
chuckle
which
even
his
increasing
uneasiness
as
to
william
could
not
altogether
repress
i
see
you
are
above
the
flattery
that
pleases
other
women
well
madam
i
know
a
tremendous
fine
woman
when
i
see
her
and
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
riding
by
the
other
day
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
have
you
for
the
second
mrs
spear
if
persistence
and
a
proper
advocacy
of
my
cause
could
accomplish
it
madam
i
was
going
to
visit
you
with
this
proposal
but
seeing
you
here
the
temptation
was
too
great
for
my
discretion
and
so
i
have
addressed
you
on
the
spot
but
you
need
not
answer
me
at
once
i
do
need
to
know
any
more
about
than
what
i
can
take
in
with
my
two
eyes
but
if
you
would
like
a
little
more
acquaintance
with
why
i
can
wait
a
couple
of
weeks
till
rubbed
the
edges
off
our
strangeness
when
when
you
think
i
will
be
so
charmed
with
deacon
spear
that
i
will
be
ready
to
settle
down
with
him
in
lost
man
lane
or
if
that
will
not
do
carry
him
off
to
gramercy
park
where
he
will
be
the
admiration
of
all
new
york
and
brooklyn
to
boot
why
man
if
i
was
so
easily
satisfied
as
that
i
would
not
be
in
a
position
for
you
to
honor
me
with
this
proposal
i
am
not
easy
to
suit
so
i
advise
you
to
turn
your
attention
to
some
one
much
more
anxious
to
be
married
than
i
am
but
and
here
i
allowed
some
of
my
real
feelings
to
appear
if
you
value
your
own
reputation
or
the
happiness
of
the
lady
you
propose
to
inveigle
into
an
union
with
you
do
not
venture
too
far
in
the
matrimonial
way
till
the
mystery
is
dispelled
which
shrouds
lost
lane
in
horror
if
you
were
an
honest
man
you
would
ask
no
one
to
share
your
fortunes
whilst
the
least
doubt
rests
upon
your
reputation
reputation
he
had
started
very
visibly
at
these
words
madam
be
careful
i
admire
you
but
no
offence
said
i
for
a
stranger
i
have
been
perhaps
unduly
frank
i
only
mean
that
any
one
who
lives
in
this
lane
must
feel
himself
more
or
less
enveloped
by
the
shadow
which
rests
upon
it
when
that
is
lifted
each
and
every
one
of
you
will
feel
himself
a
man
again
from
indications
to
be
seen
in
the
lane
that
time
may
not
be
far
distant
mother
jane
is
a
likely
source
for
the
mysteries
that
agitate
us
she
knows
just
enough
to
have
no
proper
idea
of
the
value
of
a
human
life
the
deacon
retort
was
instantaneous
madam
said
he
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
i
have
not
that
much
interest
in
what
is
going
on
down
there
if
men
have
been
killed
in
this
lane
which
i
do
not
believe
old
mother
jane
has
had
no
hand
in
it
my
opinion
is
and
you
may
value
it
or
not
just
as
you
please
that
what
the
people
hereabout
call
crimes
are
so
many
coincidences
which
some
day
or
other
will
receive
their
due
explanation
every
one
who
has
disappeared
in
this
vicinity
has
disappeared
naturally
no
one
has
been
killed
that
is
my
theory
and
you
will
find
it
correct
on
this
point
i
have
expended
more
than
a
little
thought
i
was
irate
i
was
also
dumfounded
at
his
audacity
did
he
think
i
was
the
woman
to
be
deceived
by
any
such
balderdash
as
that
but
i
shut
my
lips
tightly
lest
i
should
say
something
and
he
not
finding
this
agreeable
being
no
conversationalist
himself
drew
himself
up
with
a
pompously
expressed
hope
that
he
would
see
me
again
after
his
reputation
was
cleared
when
his
attention
as
well
as
my
own
was
diverted
by
seeing
william
slouching
figure
appear
in
the
barn
door
and
make
slowly
towards
us
instantly
the
deacon
forgot
me
in
his
interest
in
william
approach
which
was
so
slow
as
to
be
tantalizing
to
us
both
when
he
was
within
speaking
distance
deacon
spear
started
towards
him
well
he
cried
one
would
think
you
had
gone
back
a
dozen
or
so
years
and
were
again
robbing
your
neighbor
been
in
the
hay
eh
he
added
leaning
forward
and
plucking
a
wisp
or
two
from
my
clothes
well
what
did
you
find
there
in
trembling
fear
for
what
the
lout
might
answer
i
put
my
hand
on
the
buggy
rail
and
struggled
anxiously
to
my
seat
william
stepped
forward
and
loosened
the
horse
before
speaking
then
with
a
leer
he
dived
into
his
pocket
and
remarking
slowly
i
found
brought
to
light
a
small
which
we
both
recognized
as
one
he
often
carried
i
flung
it
up
in
the
hay
yesterday
in
one
of
my
fits
of
laughing
so
just
thought
i
would
bring
it
down
you
know
it
is
the
first
time
i
climbed
about
those
rafters
deacon
as
you
have
been
good
enough
to
insinuate
the
deacon
evidently
taken
aback
eyed
the
young
fellow
with
a
leer
in
which
i
saw
something
more
serious
than
mere
suspicion
was
that
all
he
began
but
evidently
thought
better
than
to
finish
whilst
william
with
a
nonchalance
that
surprised
me
blunderingly
avoided
his
eye
and
bounding
into
the
buggy
beside
me
started
up
the
horse
and
drove
slowly
off
ta
ta
deacon
he
called
back
if
you
want
to
see
fun
come
up
to
our
end
of
the
lane
there
precious
little
here
and
thus
with
a
laugh
terminated
an
interview
which
all
things
considered
was
the
most
exciting
as
well
as
the
most
humiliating
i
have
ever
taken
part
in
william
i
began
but
stopped
the
two
pigeons
whose
departure
i
had
watched
a
little
while
before
were
coming
back
and
as
i
spoke
fluttered
up
to
the
window
before
mentioned
where
they
alighted
and
began
picking
up
the
crumbs
which
i
had
seen
scattered
for
them
see
i
suddenly
exclaimed
pointing
them
out
to
william
was
i
mistaken
when
i
thought
i
saw
a
hand
drop
crumbs
from
that
window
the
answer
was
a
very
grave
one
for
him
no
said
he
for
i
have
seen
more
than
a
hand
through
the
loophole
i
made
in
the
hay
i
saw
a
man
leg
stretched
out
as
if
he
were
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
head
toward
the
window
it
was
but
a
glimpse
i
got
but
the
leg
moved
as
i
looked
at
it
and
so
i
know
that
some
one
lies
hid
in
that
little
nook
up
under
the
roof
now
it
is
any
one
belonging
to
the
lane
for
i
know
where
every
one
of
us
is
or
ought
to
be
at
this
blessed
moment
and
it
is
a
detective
for
i
heard
a
sound
like
heavy
sobbing
as
i
crouched
there
then
who
is
it
silly
rufus
i
say
and
if
that
hay
was
all
lifted
we
would
see
sights
that
would
make
us
ashamed
of
the
apologies
we
uttered
to
the
old
sneak
just
now
i
want
to
get
home
said
i
drive
fast
your
sisters
ought
to
know
this
the
girls
he
cried
yes
it
will
be
a
triumph
over
them
they
never
would
believe
i
had
an
atom
of
judgment
but
we
show
them
if
william
knollys
is
altogether
a
fool
we
were
now
near
to
trohm
hospitable
gateway
coming
from
the
excitements
of
my
late
interview
it
was
a
relief
to
perceive
the
genial
owner
of
this
beautiful
place
wandering
among
his
vines
and
testing
the
condition
of
his
fruit
by
a
careful
touch
here
and
there
as
he
heard
our
wheels
he
turned
and
seeing
who
we
were
threw
up
his
hands
in
pleasure
and
came
buoyantly
forward
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
stop
so
we
stopped
why
william
why
miss
butterworth
what
a
pleasure
such
was
his
amiable
greeting
i
thought
you
were
all
busy
at
your
end
of
the
lane
but
i
see
you
have
just
come
from
town
had
an
errand
there
i
suppose
yes
william
grumbled
eying
the
luscious
pear
trohm
held
in
his
hand
the
look
drew
a
smile
from
that
gentleman
admiring
the
first
fruits
he
observed
well
it
is
a
handsome
specimen
he
admitted
handing
it
to
me
with
his
own
peculiar
grace
i
beg
you
will
take
it
miss
butterworth
you
look
tired
pardon
me
if
i
mention
it
he
is
the
only
person
i
know
who
detects
any
signs
of
suffering
or
fatigue
on
my
part
i
am
worried
by
the
mysteries
of
this
lane
i
ventured
to
remark
i
hate
to
see
mother
jane
garden
uprooted
ah
he
acquiesced
with
much
evidence
of
good
feeling
it
is
a
distressing
thing
to
witness
i
wish
she
might
have
been
spared
william
there
are
other
pears
on
the
tree
this
came
from
tie
up
the
horse
i
pray
and
gather
a
dozen
or
so
of
these
for
your
sisters
they
will
never
be
in
better
condition
for
plucking
than
they
are
william
whose
mouth
and
eyes
were
both
watering
for
a
taste
of
the
fine
fruit
thus
offered
moved
with
alacrity
to
obey
this
invitation
while
i
more
startled
than
pleased
or
rather
as
much
startled
as
pleased
by
the
prospect
of
a
momentary
with
our
agreeable
neighbor
sat
uneasily
eying
the
luscious
fruit
in
my
hand
and
wishing
i
was
ten
years
younger
that
the
blush
i
felt
slowly
stealing
up
my
cheek
might
seem
more
appropriate
to
the
occasion
but
trohm
appeared
not
to
share
my
wish
he
was
evidently
so
satisfied
with
me
as
i
was
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
at
first
and
when
he
did
but
tut
tut
you
have
no
desire
to
hear
any
such
confidences
as
these
i
am
sure
a
expressions
of
admiration
for
a
lady
may
savor
of
romance
to
her
but
hardly
to
the
rest
of
the
world
so
i
will
pass
this
conversation
by
with
the
single
admission
that
it
ended
in
a
question
to
which
i
felt
obliged
to
return
a
reluctant
trohm
was
just
recovering
from
the
disappointment
of
this
when
william
sauntered
back
with
his
hands
and
pockets
full
ah
that
graceless
scamp
chuckled
with
a
suspicious
look
at
our
downcast
faces
been
improving
the
opportunity
eh
trohm
who
had
fallen
back
against
his
old
surveyed
his
young
neighbor
for
the
first
time
with
a
look
of
anger
but
it
vanished
almost
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
and
he
contented
himself
with
a
low
bow
in
which
i
read
real
grief
this
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
was
about
to
open
my
lips
with
a
kind
phrase
or
two
when
a
flutter
took
place
over
our
heads
and
the
two
pigeons
whose
flight
i
had
watched
more
than
once
during
the
last
hour
flew
down
and
settled
upon
trohm
arm
and
shoulders
oh
i
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
shrinking
that
i
hardly
understood
myself
and
though
i
covered
up
the
exclamation
with
as
brisk
a
as
my
inward
perturbation
would
allow
that
sight
and
the
involuntary
ejaculation
i
had
uttered
were
all
i
saw
or
heard
during
our
hasty
drive
homeward
xxxvii
i
astonish
gryce
and
he
astonishes
me
but
as
we
approached
the
group
of
curious
people
which
now
filled
up
the
whole
highway
in
front
of
mother
jane
cottage
i
broke
from
the
nightmare
into
which
this
last
discovery
had
thrown
me
and
turning
to
william
said
with
a
resolute
air
you
and
your
sisters
are
not
of
one
mind
regarding
these
disappearances
you
ascribe
them
to
deacon
spear
but
they
whom
do
they
ascribe
them
to
i
should
think
it
would
take
a
woman
of
your
wit
to
answer
that
question
the
rebuke
was
deserved
i
had
wit
but
i
had
refused
to
exercise
it
my
blind
partiality
for
a
man
of
pleasing
exterior
and
magnetic
address
had
prevented
the
cool
play
of
my
usual
judgment
due
to
the
occasion
and
the
trust
which
had
been
imposed
in
me
by
gryce
resolved
that
this
should
end
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
my
feelings
i
quietly
said
you
allude
to
mr
trohm
that
is
the
name
he
carelessly
assented
girls
you
know
let
their
prejudices
run
away
with
them
an
old
grudge
yes
i
tentatively
put
in
he
persecuted
your
mother
and
so
they
think
him
capable
of
any
wickedness
the
growl
which
william
gave
was
not
one
of
dissent
but
i
do
care
what
they
think
said
he
looking
down
at
the
heap
of
fruit
which
lay
between
us
i
trohm
friend
and
do
believe
one
word
they
choose
to
insinuate
against
him
what
if
he
did
like
what
my
mother
did
we
did
like
it
either
and
william
i
calmly
remarked
if
your
sisters
knew
that
silly
rufus
had
been
found
in
deacon
spear
barn
they
would
no
longer
do
trohm
this
injustice
no
that
would
settle
them
that
would
give
me
a
triumph
which
would
last
long
after
this
matter
was
out
of
the
way
very
well
then
said
i
i
am
going
to
bring
about
this
triumph
i
am
going
to
tell
gryce
at
once
what
we
have
discovered
in
deacon
spear
barn
and
without
waiting
for
his
ah
yes
or
no
i
jumped
from
the
buggy
and
made
my
way
to
the
detective
side
his
welcome
was
somewhat
unexpected
ah
fresh
news
he
exclaimed
i
see
it
in
your
eye
what
have
you
chanced
upon
madam
in
your
disinterested
drive
into
town
i
thought
i
had
eliminated
all
expression
from
my
face
and
that
my
words
would
bring
a
certain
surprise
with
them
but
it
is
useless
to
try
to
surprise
gryce
you
read
me
like
a
book
said
i
i
have
something
to
add
to
the
situation
gryce
i
have
just
come
from
the
other
end
of
the
lane
where
i
found
a
clue
which
may
shorten
the
suspense
of
this
weary
day
and
possibly
save
lucetta
from
the
painful
task
she
has
undertaken
in
our
interests
chittenden
ring
i
paused
for
the
exclamation
of
encouragement
he
is
accustomed
to
give
on
such
occasions
and
while
i
paused
prepared
for
my
accustomed
triumph
he
did
not
fail
me
in
the
exclamation
nor
did
i
miss
my
expected
triumph
was
not
found
by
mother
jane
or
even
brought
to
her
in
any
ordinary
way
or
by
any
ordinary
messenger
it
came
to
her
on
a
pigeon
neck
the
pigeon
you
will
find
lying
dead
among
the
bushes
in
the
knollys
yard
he
was
amazed
he
controlled
himself
but
he
was
very
visibly
amazed
his
exclamations
proved
it
madam
miss
butterworth
this
ring
chittenden
ring
whose
presence
in
her
hut
we
thought
an
evidence
of
guilt
was
brought
to
her
by
one
of
her
pigeons
so
she
told
me
i
aroused
her
fury
by
showing
her
the
empty
husk
in
which
it
had
been
concealed
in
her
rage
at
its
loss
she
revealed
the
fact
i
have
just
mentioned
it
is
a
curious
one
sir
and
one
i
am
a
little
proud
to
have
discovered
curious
it
is
more
than
curious
it
is
bizarre
and
will
rank
i
am
safe
in
prophesying
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
facts
that
have
ever
adorned
the
annals
of
the
police
madam
when
i
say
i
envy
you
the
honor
of
its
discovery
you
will
appreciate
my
estimate
of
it
and
you
but
when
did
you
find
this
out
and
what
explanation
are
you
able
to
give
of
the
presence
of
this
ring
on
a
pigeon
neck
sir
to
your
first
question
i
need
only
reply
that
i
was
here
two
hours
or
so
ago
and
to
the
second
that
everything
points
to
the
fact
that
the
ring
was
attached
to
the
bird
by
the
victim
himself
as
an
appeal
for
succor
to
whoever
might
be
fortunate
enough
to
find
it
unhappily
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
that
is
the
which
often
befalls
prisoners
prisoners
yes
can
not
you
imagine
a
person
shut
up
in
an
inaccessible
place
making
some
such
attempt
to
communicate
with
his
but
what
inaccessible
place
have
we
in
wait
said
i
you
have
been
in
deacon
spear
barn
certainly
many
times
but
the
answer
glib
as
it
was
showed
shock
i
began
to
gather
courage
well
said
i
there
is
a
in
that
barn
which
i
dare
declare
you
have
not
penetrated
do
you
think
so
madam
a
little
loft
way
up
under
the
eaves
which
can
only
be
reached
by
clambering
over
the
rafters
did
deacon
spear
tell
you
there
was
such
a
place
no
but
william
then
i
inexorably
pursued
he
says
he
pointed
such
a
spot
out
to
you
and
that
you
at
it
as
inaccessible
and
not
worth
the
searching
william
is
a
madam
i
beg
your
pardon
but
william
has
just
wit
enough
to
make
trouble
but
there
is
such
a
place
there
i
urged
and
what
is
more
there
is
some
one
hidden
in
it
now
i
saw
him
myself
saw
him
saw
a
part
of
him
in
short
saw
his
hand
he
was
engaged
in
scattering
crumbs
for
the
pigeons
that
does
not
look
like
starvation
smiled
gryce
with
the
first
hint
of
sarcasm
he
had
allowed
himself
to
make
use
of
in
this
interview
no
said
i
but
the
time
may
not
have
come
to
inflict
this
penalty
on
silly
rufus
he
has
been
there
but
a
few
days
and
well
what
have
i
said
now
nothing
nothing
but
what
made
you
think
the
hand
you
saw
belonged
to
silly
rufus
because
he
was
the
last
person
to
disappear
from
this
lane
the
last
what
am
i
saying
he
was
the
last
lucetta
lover
was
the
last
gryce
could
that
hand
have
belonged
to
mr
ostrander
i
was
intensely
excited
so
much
so
that
gryce
made
me
a
warning
gesture
hush
he
whispered
you
are
attracting
attention
that
hand
the
hand
of
ostrander
and
the
reason
why
i
did
not
accept
william
knollys
suggestion
to
search
the
deacon
was
because
i
knew
it
had
been
chosen
as
a
place
of
refuge
by
this
missing
lover
of
lucetta
xxxviii
a
few
words
never
have
keener
or
more
conflicting
emotions
been
awakened
in
my
breast
than
by
these
simple
words
but
alive
to
the
necessity
of
hiding
my
feelings
from
those
about
me
i
gave
no
token
of
my
surprise
but
rather
turned
a
stonier
face
than
common
upon
the
man
who
had
caused
it
refuge
i
repeated
he
is
there
then
of
his
own
free
will
or
yours
i
sarcastically
added
not
being
able
to
quite
keep
down
this
reproach
as
i
remembered
the
deception
practised
upon
lucetta
ostrander
madam
has
been
spending
the
week
with
deacon
spear
they
are
old
friends
you
know
that
he
should
spend
it
quietly
and
to
a
degree
in
hiding
was
as
much
his
plan
as
mine
for
while
he
found
it
impossible
to
leave
lucetta
in
the
doubtful
position
in
which
she
and
her
family
at
present
stand
he
did
not
wish
to
aggravate
her
misery
by
the
thought
that
he
was
thus
jeopardizing
the
position
on
which
all
his
hopes
of
future
advancement
depended
he
preferred
to
watch
and
wait
in
secret
seeing
which
i
did
what
i
could
to
further
his
wishes
his
usual
lodging
was
with
the
family
but
when
the
search
was
instituted
i
suggested
that
he
should
remove
himself
to
that
eyrie
back
of
the
hay
where
you
were
sharp
enough
to
detect
him
do
attempt
any
of
your
flatteries
upon
me
i
protested
they
will
not
make
me
forget
that
i
have
not
been
treated
fairly
and
lucetta
oh
may
i
not
tell
lucetta
and
spoil
our
entire
prospect
of
solving
this
mystery
no
madam
you
may
not
tell
lucetta
when
fate
has
put
such
a
card
into
our
hands
as
i
played
with
that
telegram
we
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
not
to
profit
by
it
lucetta
despair
makes
her
bold
upon
that
boldness
we
depend
to
discover
and
bring
to
justice
a
great
criminal
i
felt
myself
turn
pale
for
that
very
reason
perhaps
i
assumed
a
still
sterner
air
and
composedly
said
if
ostrander
is
in
hiding
at
the
deacon
and
he
and
his
host
are
both
in
your
confidence
then
the
only
man
whom
can
designate
in
your
thoughts
by
this
dreadful
title
must
be
mr
trohm
i
had
perhaps
hoped
he
would
recoil
at
this
or
give
some
other
evidence
of
his
amazement
at
an
assumption
which
to
me
seemed
preposterous
but
he
did
not
and
i
saw
with
what
feelings
may
be
imagined
that
this
conclusion
which
was
half
bravado
with
me
had
been
accepted
by
him
long
enough
for
no
emotion
to
follow
its
utterance
oh
i
exclaimed
how
can
you
reconcile
such
a
suspicion
with
the
attitude
you
have
always
preserved
towards
mr
trohm
madam
said
he
do
not
criticise
my
attitude
without
taking
into
account
existing
appearances
they
are
undoubtedly
in
favor
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
i
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
why
it
was
in
response
to
his
appeal
that
you
came
to
at
all
gryce
smile
conveyed
a
reproach
which
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
i
amply
merited
had
he
spent
evening
after
evening
at
my
house
entertaining
me
with
tales
of
the
devices
and
the
many
inconsistencies
of
criminals
to
be
met
now
by
such
a
puerile
disclaimer
as
this
but
beyond
that
smile
he
said
nothing
on
the
contrary
he
continued
as
if
i
had
not
spoken
at
all
but
appearances
he
declared
will
not
stand
before
the
insight
of
a
girl
like
lucetta
she
has
marked
the
man
as
guilty
and
we
will
give
her
the
opportunity
of
proving
the
correctness
of
her
instinct
but
trohm
house
has
been
searched
and
you
have
found
nothing
nothing
i
argued
somewhat
feebly
that
is
the
reason
we
find
ourselves
forced
to
yield
our
judgment
to
lucetta
intuitions
was
his
quick
reply
and
smiling
upon
me
with
his
blandest
air
he
obligingly
added
miss
butterworth
is
a
woman
of
too
much
character
not
to
abide
the
event
with
all
her
accustomed
composure
and
with
this
final
suggestion
i
was
as
yet
too
crushed
to
resent
he
dismissed
me
to
an
afternoon
of
unparalleled
suspense
and
many
contradictory
emotions
xxxix
under
a
crimson
sky
when
in
the
course
of
events
the
current
of
my
thoughts
receive
a
decided
check
and
i
find
myself
forced
to
change
former
conclusions
or
habituate
myself
to
new
ideas
and
a
fresh
standpoint
i
do
it
as
i
do
everything
else
with
determination
and
a
total
disregard
of
my
own
previous
predilections
before
the
afternoon
was
well
over
i
was
ready
for
any
revelations
which
might
follow
lucetta
contemplated
action
merely
reserving
a
vague
hope
that
my
judgment
would
yet
be
found
superior
to
her
instinct
at
five
the
diggers
began
to
go
home
nothing
had
been
found
under
the
soil
of
mother
jane
garden
and
the
excitement
of
search
which
had
animated
them
early
in
the
day
had
given
place
to
a
dull
resentment
mainly
directed
towards
the
knollys
family
if
one
could
judge
of
these
men
feelings
by
the
heavy
scowls
and
significant
gestures
with
which
they
passed
our
gateway
by
six
the
last
man
had
filed
by
leaving
gryce
free
for
the
work
which
lay
before
him
i
had
retired
long
before
this
to
my
room
where
i
awaited
the
hour
set
by
lucetta
with
a
feverish
impatience
quite
new
to
me
as
none
of
us
could
eat
the
supper
table
had
not
been
laid
and
though
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
what
was
in
store
for
us
the
sombre
silence
and
oppression
under
which
the
whole
house
lay
seemed
a
portent
that
was
by
no
means
encouraging
suddenly
i
heard
a
knock
at
my
door
rising
hastily
i
opened
it
loreen
stood
before
me
with
parted
lips
and
terror
in
all
her
looks
come
she
cried
come
and
see
what
i
have
found
in
lucetta
room
then
she
gone
i
cried
yes
she
gone
but
come
and
see
what
she
has
left
behind
her
hastening
after
loreen
who
was
by
this
time
down
the
hall
i
soon
found
myself
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
i
knew
to
be
lucetta
she
made
me
promise
cried
loreen
halting
to
look
back
at
me
that
i
would
let
her
go
alone
and
that
i
would
not
enter
the
highway
till
an
hour
after
her
departure
but
with
these
evidences
of
the
extent
of
her
dread
before
us
how
can
we
stay
in
this
house
and
dragging
me
to
a
table
she
showed
me
lying
on
its
top
a
folded
paper
and
two
letters
the
folded
paper
was
lucetta
will
and
the
letters
were
directed
severally
to
loreen
and
to
myself
with
the
injunction
that
they
were
not
to
be
read
till
she
had
been
gone
six
hours
she
has
prepared
herself
for
death
i
exclaimed
shocked
to
my
core
but
determinedly
hiding
it
but
you
need
not
fear
any
such
event
is
she
not
accompanied
by
mr
gryce
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
think
so
how
could
she
accomplish
her
task
if
not
alone
miss
butterworth
miss
butterworth
she
has
gone
to
brave
trohm
our
mother
persecutor
and
our
enemy
thinking
hoping
believing
that
in
so
doing
she
will
rouse
his
criminal
instincts
if
he
has
them
and
so
lead
to
the
discovery
of
his
crimes
and
the
means
by
which
he
has
been
enabled
to
carry
them
out
so
long
undetected
it
is
noble
it
is
heroic
it
is
but
oh
miss
butterworth
i
have
never
broken
a
promise
to
any
one
before
in
all
my
life
but
i
am
going
to
break
the
one
i
made
her
come
let
us
fly
after
her
she
has
her
lover
memory
but
i
have
nothing
in
all
the
world
but
her
i
immediately
turned
and
hastened
down
the
stairs
in
a
state
of
humiliation
which
should
have
made
ample
amends
for
any
show
of
arrogance
i
may
have
indulged
in
in
my
more
fortunate
moments
loreen
followed
me
and
when
we
were
in
the
lower
hall
she
gave
me
a
look
and
said
my
promise
was
not
to
enter
the
highway
would
you
be
afraid
to
follow
me
by
another
road
a
secret
road
all
overgrown
with
thistles
and
blackberry
bushes
which
have
not
been
trimmed
up
for
years
i
thought
of
my
thin
shoes
my
neat
silk
dress
but
only
to
forget
them
the
next
moment
i
will
go
anywhere
said
i
but
loreen
was
already
too
far
in
advance
of
me
to
answer
she
was
young
and
lithe
and
had
reached
the
kitchen
before
i
had
passed
the
flower
parlor
but
when
we
had
sped
clear
of
the
house
i
found
that
my
progress
bade
fair
to
be
as
rapid
as
hers
for
her
agitation
was
a
hindrance
to
her
while
excitement
always
brings
out
my
powers
and
heightens
both
my
wits
and
my
judgment
our
way
lay
past
the
stables
from
which
i
expected
every
minute
to
see
two
or
three
dogs
jump
but
william
who
had
been
discreetly
sent
out
of
the
way
early
in
the
afternoon
had
taken
saracen
with
him
and
possibly
the
rest
so
our
passing
by
disturbed
nothing
not
even
ourselves
the
next
moment
we
were
in
a
field
of
prickers
through
which
we
both
struggled
till
we
came
into
a
sort
of
swamp
here
was
bad
going
but
we
floundered
on
edging
continually
toward
a
distant
fence
beyond
which
rose
the
symmetrical
lines
of
an
orchard
trohm
orchard
in
which
those
pleasant
fruits
grew
which
bah
should
i
ever
be
able
to
get
the
taste
of
them
out
of
my
mouth
at
a
tiny
gateway
covered
with
vines
loreen
stopped
i
do
not
believe
this
has
been
opened
for
years
but
it
must
be
opened
now
and
throwing
her
whole
weight
against
it
she
burst
it
through
and
bidding
me
pass
hastened
after
me
over
the
trailing
branches
and
made
without
a
word
for
the
winding
path
we
now
saw
clearly
defined
on
the
edge
of
the
orchard
before
us
oh
exclaimed
loreen
stopping
one
moment
to
catch
her
breath
i
do
not
know
what
i
fear
or
to
what
our
steps
will
bring
us
i
only
know
that
i
must
hunt
for
lucetta
till
i
find
her
if
there
is
danger
where
she
is
i
must
share
it
you
can
rest
here
or
come
farther
on
i
went
farther
on
suddenly
we
both
started
a
man
had
sprung
up
from
behind
the
hedgerow
that
ran
parallel
with
the
fence
that
surrounded
trohm
place
silence
he
whispered
putting
his
finger
on
his
lips
if
you
are
looking
for
miss
knollys
he
added
seeing
us
both
pause
aghast
she
is
on
the
lawn
beyond
talking
to
trohm
if
you
will
step
here
you
can
see
her
she
is
in
no
kind
of
danger
but
if
she
were
gryce
is
in
the
first
row
of
trees
to
the
back
there
and
a
call
from
me
that
made
me
remember
my
whistle
it
was
still
round
my
neck
but
my
hand
which
had
instinctively
gone
to
it
fell
again
in
extraordinary
emotion
as
i
realized
the
situation
and
compared
it
with
that
of
the
morning
when
blinded
by
egotism
and
foolish
prejudice
in
favor
of
this
man
i
ate
of
his
fruit
and
hearkened
to
his
outrageous
addresses
come
beckoned
loreen
happily
too
absorbed
in
her
own
emotions
to
notice
mine
let
us
get
nearer
if
trohm
is
the
wicked
man
we
fear
there
is
no
telling
what
the
means
are
which
he
uses
to
get
rid
of
his
victims
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
in
his
house
but
who
knows
where
the
danger
may
lurk
and
that
it
may
not
be
near
her
now
it
was
evidently
to
dare
it
she
came
to
offer
herself
as
a
martyr
that
we
might
know
hush
i
whispered
controlling
my
own
fears
roused
against
my
will
by
this
display
of
terror
in
this
usually
calmest
of
natures
no
danger
can
menace
her
where
they
stand
unless
he
is
a
common
assassin
and
carries
a
pistol
no
pistol
murmured
the
man
who
had
crept
again
near
us
pistols
make
a
noise
he
will
not
use
a
pistol
good
god
i
whispered
do
not
share
her
sister
fears
that
it
is
in
the
heart
of
this
man
to
kill
lucetta
five
strong
men
have
disappeared
hereabout
said
the
fellow
never
moving
his
eye
from
the
couple
before
us
why
not
one
weak
girl
with
a
cry
loreen
started
forward
run
she
whispered
run
but
as
this
word
left
her
lips
a
slight
movement
took
place
in
the
belt
of
trees
where
we
had
been
told
gryce
lay
in
hiding
and
we
could
see
him
issue
for
a
moment
into
sight
with
his
finger
like
that
of
his
man
laid
warningly
on
his
lips
loreen
trembled
and
drew
back
seeing
which
the
man
beside
us
pointed
to
the
hedge
and
whispered
softly
there
is
just
room
between
it
and
the
fence
for
a
person
to
pass
sideways
if
you
and
this
lady
want
to
get
nearer
to
miss
knollys
you
might
take
that
road
but
gryce
will
expect
you
to
be
very
quiet
the
young
lady
expressly
said
before
she
came
into
this
place
that
she
could
do
nothing
if
for
any
reason
trohm
should
suspect
they
were
not
alone
we
will
be
quiet
i
assured
him
anxious
to
hide
my
face
which
i
felt
twitch
at
every
mention
of
trohm
name
loreen
was
already
behind
the
hedge
the
evening
was
one
of
those
which
are
made
for
peace
the
sun
which
had
set
in
crimson
had
left
a
glow
on
the
branches
of
the
forest
which
had
not
yet
faded
into
the
gray
of
twilight
the
lawn
around
which
we
were
skirting
had
not
lost
the
mellow
brilliancy
which
made
it
sparkle
nor
had
the
cluster
of
hollyhocks
which
set
their
gorgeousness
against
the
neat
yellow
of
the
peaceful
doorposts
shown
any
dimness
in
their
glory
which
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
the
setting
sun
but
though
i
saw
all
this
it
no
longer
appeared
to
me
desirable
lucetta
and
lucetta
fate
the
mystery
and
the
impossibility
of
its
being
explained
out
here
in
the
midst
of
turf
and
blossoms
filled
all
my
thoughts
and
made
me
forget
my
own
secret
cause
for
shame
and
humiliation
loreen
who
had
wormed
her
way
along
till
she
crouched
nearly
opposite
to
the
place
where
her
sister
stood
plucked
me
by
the
gown
as
i
approached
her
and
pointing
to
the
hedge
which
pressed
up
so
close
it
nearly
touched
our
faces
seemed
to
bid
me
look
through
searching
for
a
spot
where
there
was
a
small
opening
i
put
my
eye
to
this
and
immediately
drew
back
they
are
moving
nearer
the
gate
i
signalled
to
loreen
at
which
she
crept
along
a
few
paces
but
with
a
stealth
so
great
that
alert
as
i
was
i
could
not
hear
a
twig
snap
i
endeavored
to
imitate
her
but
not
with
as
much
success
as
i
could
wish
the
sense
of
horror
which
had
all
at
once
settled
upon
me
the
supernatural
dread
of
something
which
i
could
not
see
but
which
i
felt
had
seized
me
for
the
first
time
and
made
the
ruddy
sky
and
the
broad
stretch
of
velvet
turf
with
the
shadows
playing
over
it
of
swaying
and
clustered
oleanders
more
thrilling
and
awesome
to
me
than
the
dim
halls
of
the
haunted
house
of
the
knollys
family
in
that
midnight
hour
when
i
saw
a
body
carried
out
for
burial
amid
trouble
and
hush
and
a
mystery
so
great
it
would
have
daunted
most
spirits
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
the
very
sweetness
of
the
scene
made
its
horror
never
have
i
had
such
sensations
never
have
i
felt
so
deeply
the
power
of
the
unseen
yet
it
seemed
so
impossible
that
anything
could
happen
here
anything
which
would
explain
the
total
disappearance
of
several
persons
at
different
times
without
a
trace
of
their
fate
being
left
to
the
eye
that
i
could
but
liken
my
state
to
that
of
nightmare
where
visions
take
the
place
of
realities
and
often
overwhelm
them
i
had
pressed
too
close
against
the
hedge
as
i
struggled
with
these
feelings
and
the
sound
i
made
struck
me
as
distinct
if
not
alarming
but
the
were
rustling
overhead
and
while
lucetta
might
have
heard
the
crack
her
companion
gave
no
evidence
of
doing
so
we
could
distinguish
what
they
were
saying
now
and
realizing
this
we
stopped
moving
and
gave
our
whole
attention
to
listening
trohm
was
speaking
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
his
voice
it
had
so
changed
in
tone
nor
could
i
perceive
in
his
features
distorted
as
they
now
were
by
every
evil
passion
the
once
quiet
and
dignified
countenance
which
had
so
lately
imposed
upon
me
lucetta
my
little
lucetta
he
was
saying
so
she
has
come
to
see
me
come
to
taunt
me
with
the
loss
of
her
lover
whom
she
says
i
have
robbed
her
of
almost
before
her
eyes
i
rob
her
how
can
i
rob
her
or
any
one
of
a
man
with
a
voice
and
arm
of
his
own
stronger
than
mine
am
i
a
wizard
to
dissipate
his
body
in
vapor
yet
can
you
find
it
in
my
house
or
on
my
lawn
you
are
a
fool
lucetta
so
are
all
these
men
about
here
fools
it
is
in
your
house
hush
she
cried
her
slight
figure
rising
till
we
forgot
it
was
the
feeble
lucetta
we
were
gazing
at
no
more
accusations
directed
against
us
it
is
you
who
must
expect
them
now
trohm
your
evil
practices
are
discovered
you
will
have
the
police
here
in
earnest
they
did
but
play
with
you
when
they
were
here
before
you
child
he
gasped
striving
however
to
restrain
all
evidences
of
shock
and
terror
why
who
was
it
called
in
the
police
and
set
them
working
in
lost
man
lane
was
it
not
i
yes
that
they
might
not
suspect
you
and
perhaps
that
they
might
suspect
us
but
it
was
useless
obadiah
trohm
althea
knollys
children
have
been
but
the
limit
of
their
forbearance
has
been
reached
when
you
laid
your
hand
upon
my
lover
you
roused
a
spirit
in
me
that
nothing
but
your
own
destruction
can
satisfy
where
is
he
trohm
and
where
is
silly
rufus
and
all
the
rest
who
have
vanished
between
deacon
spear
house
and
the
little
home
of
the
cripples
on
the
highroad
they
have
asked
me
this
question
but
if
any
one
in
lost
lane
can
answer
it
is
you
persecutor
of
my
mother
and
traducer
of
ourselves
whom
i
here
denounce
in
face
of
these
skies
where
god
reigns
and
this
earth
where
man
lives
to
harry
and
condemn
and
then
i
saw
that
the
instinct
of
this
girl
had
accomplished
what
our
united
acumen
and
skill
had
failed
to
do
the
old
man
indeed
he
seemed
an
old
man
now
cringed
and
the
wrinkles
came
out
in
his
face
till
he
was
demoniacally
ugly
you
viper
he
shrieked
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
crime
you
whose
mother
would
have
died
in
jail
but
for
my
forbearance
have
you
ever
seen
me
set
my
foot
upon
a
worm
look
at
my
fruit
and
flowers
look
at
my
home
without
a
spot
or
blemish
to
mar
its
neatness
and
propriety
can
a
man
who
loves
these
things
stomach
the
destruction
of
a
man
much
less
of
a
silly
yawping
boy
lucetta
you
are
mad
mad
or
sane
my
accusation
will
have
its
results
trohm
i
believe
too
deeply
in
your
guilt
not
to
make
others
do
so
ah
said
he
then
you
have
not
done
so
yet
you
believe
this
and
that
but
you
have
not
told
any
one
what
your
suspicions
are
no
she
calmly
returned
though
her
face
blanched
to
the
colorlessness
of
wax
i
have
not
said
what
i
think
of
you
yet
oh
the
cunning
that
crept
into
his
face
she
has
not
said
oh
the
little
lucetta
the
wise
the
careful
little
lucetta
but
i
will
she
cried
meeting
his
eye
with
the
courage
and
constancy
of
a
martyr
though
i
bring
destruction
upon
myself
i
will
denounce
you
and
do
it
before
the
night
has
settled
down
upon
us
i
have
a
lover
to
avenge
a
brother
to
defend
besides
the
earth
should
be
rid
of
such
a
monster
as
you
such
a
monster
as
i
well
my
pretty
one
his
voice
grown
suddenly
wheedling
his
face
a
study
of
mingled
passions
we
will
see
about
that
come
just
a
step
nearer
lucetta
i
want
to
see
if
you
are
really
the
little
girl
i
used
to
dandle
on
my
knee
they
were
now
near
the
gateway
they
had
been
moving
all
this
time
his
hand
was
on
the
curb
of
the
old
well
his
face
so
turned
that
it
caught
the
full
glare
of
the
setting
sun
leaned
toward
the
girl
exerting
a
fascinating
influence
upon
her
she
took
the
step
he
asked
and
before
we
could
shriek
out
beware
we
saw
him
bend
forward
with
a
sudden
quick
motion
and
then
start
upright
again
while
her
form
which
but
an
instant
before
had
stood
there
in
all
its
frail
and
inspired
beauty
tottered
as
if
the
ground
were
bending
under
it
and
in
another
moment
disappeared
from
our
appalled
sight
swallowed
in
some
dreadful
cavern
that
for
an
instant
yawned
in
the
smoothly
cut
lawn
before
us
and
then
vanished
again
from
sight
as
if
it
had
never
been
a
shriek
from
my
whistle
mingled
with
a
simultaneous
cry
of
agony
from
loreen
we
heard
gryce
rush
from
behind
us
but
we
ourselves
found
it
impossible
to
stir
paralyzed
as
we
were
by
the
sight
of
the
old
man
demoniacal
delight
he
was
leaping
to
and
fro
over
the
turf
holding
up
his
fingers
in
the
red
sunset
glare
six
he
shrieked
six
and
room
for
two
more
oh
it
a
merry
life
i
lead
flowers
and
fruit
and
oh
how
i
cringed
at
that
and
now
and
then
a
little
spice
like
this
but
where
is
my
pretty
lucetta
surely
she
was
here
a
moment
ago
how
could
she
have
vanished
then
so
quickly
i
do
not
see
her
form
amid
the
trees
there
is
no
trace
of
her
presence
upon
the
lawn
and
if
they
search
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
bottom
to
top
they
will
find
nothing
of
her
no
not
so
much
as
a
print
of
her
footstep
or
the
scent
of
the
violets
she
so
often
wears
tucked
into
her
hair
these
last
words
uttered
in
a
different
voice
from
the
rest
gave
the
clue
to
the
whole
situation
we
saw
even
while
we
all
bounded
forward
to
the
rescue
of
the
devoted
maiden
that
he
was
one
of
those
maniacs
who
have
perfect
control
over
themselves
and
pass
for
very
decent
sort
of
men
except
in
the
moment
of
triumph
and
noting
his
look
of
sinister
delight
perceived
that
half
his
pleasure
and
almost
his
sole
reward
for
the
horrible
crimes
he
had
perpetrated
was
in
the
mystery
surrounding
his
victims
and
the
entire
immunity
from
suspicion
which
up
to
this
time
he
had
enjoyed
meantime
gryce
had
covered
the
wretch
with
his
pistol
and
his
man
who
succeeded
in
reaching
the
place
even
sooner
than
ourselves
hampered
as
we
were
by
the
almost
impenetrable
hedge
behind
which
we
had
crouched
tried
to
lift
the
lid
we
could
faintly
discern
there
but
this
was
impossible
until
i
with
almost
superhuman
considering
the
imperative
nature
of
the
emergency
found
the
spring
hidden
in
the
which
worked
the
deadly
mechanism
a
yell
from
the
writhing
creature
cowering
under
the
detective
pistol
guided
me
unconsciously
in
its
action
and
in
another
moment
we
saw
the
fatal
lid
tip
and
disclose
what
appeared
to
be
the
remains
of
a
second
well
long
ago
dried
up
and
abandoned
for
the
other
the
rescue
of
lucetta
followed
as
she
had
fainted
in
falling
she
had
not
suffered
much
and
soon
we
had
the
supreme
delight
of
seeing
her
eyes
unclose
ah
she
murmured
in
a
voice
whose
echo
pierced
to
every
heart
save
that
of
the
guilty
wretch
now
lying
handcuffed
on
the
sward
i
thought
i
saw
albert
he
was
not
dead
and
i
but
here
gryce
with
an
air
at
once
contrite
and
yet
strangely
triumphant
interposed
his
benevolent
face
between
hers
and
her
weeping
sister
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
which
turned
her
pallid
cheek
to
a
glowing
scarlet
rising
up
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
let
him
lift
her
as
he
carried
her
where
was
his
rheumatism
now
out
of
those
baleful
grounds
and
away
from
the
reach
of
the
maniac
mingled
laughs
and
cries
her
face
was
peace
itself
but
his
well
his
was
a
study
xl
explanations
the
hour
we
all
spent
together
late
that
night
in
the
old
house
was
unlike
any
hour
which
that
place
had
seen
for
years
ostrander
lucetta
loreen
william
gryce
and
myself
all
were
there
and
as
an
especial
grace
saracen
was
allowed
to
enter
that
there
might
not
be
a
cloud
upon
a
single
face
there
assembled
though
it
is
a
small
matter
i
will
add
that
this
dog
persisted
in
lying
down
by
my
side
not
yielding
even
to
the
wiles
of
his
master
whose
amusement
over
this
fact
kept
him
to
the
last
adieu
there
were
too
few
candles
in
the
house
to
make
it
bright
but
unearthly
beauty
the
peace
in
loreen
soft
eyes
made
us
forget
the
sombreness
of
our
surroundings
and
the
meagreness
of
the
entertainment
hannah
attempted
to
offer
us
it
was
the
promise
of
coming
joy
and
when
our
two
guests
departed
i
bade
to
the
girls
in
their
grim
upper
hall
it
was
with
feelings
which
found
their
best
expression
in
the
two
letters
i
hastened
to
write
as
soon
as
i
gained
the
refuge
of
my
own
apartment
i
will
admit
you
sufficiently
into
my
confidence
to
let
you
read
those
letters
the
first
of
them
ran
thus
dear
olive
to
make
others
happy
is
the
best
way
to
forget
our
own
misfortunes
a
sudden
wedding
is
to
take
place
in
this
house
order
at
once
for
me
from
the
shops
you
know
me
to
be
in
the
habit
of
patronizing
a
wedding
gown
of
dainty
white
taffeta
i
did
this
not
to
recall
too
painfully
to
herself
the
wedding
dress
i
helped
her
buy
and
which
was
as
you
may
remember
of
creamy
satin
with
chiffon
trimmings
and
a
wedding
veil
of
tulle
add
to
this
a
dress
suitable
for
ocean
travel
and
a
costumes
adapted
to
a
southern
climate
let
everything
be
suitable
for
a
delicate
but
spirited
girl
who
has
seen
trouble
but
who
is
going
to
be
happy
now
if
a
little
attention
and
money
can
make
her
so
do
not
spare
expense
yet
show
no
extravagance
for
she
is
a
shy
bird
easily
frightened
the
measurements
you
will
find
enclosed
also
those
of
another
young
lady
her
sister
who
must
also
be
supplied
with
a
white
dress
the
material
of
which
however
had
better
be
of
crape
all
these
things
must
be
here
by
wednesday
evening
my
own
best
dress
included
on
saturday
evening
you
may
look
for
my
return
i
shall
bring
the
latter
young
lady
with
me
so
your
present
loneliness
will
be
forgotten
in
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
an
agreeable
guest
faithfully

amelia
butterworth
the
second
letter
was
a
longer
and
more
important
one
it
was
directed
to
the
president
of
the
company
which
had
proposed
to
send
ostrander
to
south
america
in
it
i
related
enough
of
the
circumstances
which
had
kept
ostrander
in
to
interest
him
in
the
young
couple
personally
and
then
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
forgive
ostrander
this
delay
and
allow
him
to
sail
with
his
young
bride
by
the
next
steamer
i
myself
would
undertake
to
advance
whatever
sums
might
have
been
lost
by
this
change
of
arrangement
i
did
not
know
then
that
gryce
had
already
made
this
matter
good
with
this
same
gentleman
the
next
morning
we
all
took
a
walk
in
the
lane
i
say
nothing
about
the
night
if
i
did
not
choose
to
sleep
or
if
i
had
any
cause
not
to
feel
quite
as
elevated
in
spirit
as
the
young
people
about
me
there
is
surely
no
reason
why
i
should
dwell
upon
it
with
you
or
even
apologize
for
a
weakness
which
you
will
regard
i
hope
as
an
exception
setting
off
my
customary
strength
now
a
walk
in
this
lane
was
an
event
to
feel
at
liberty
to
stroll
among
its
shadows
without
fear
to
know
that
the
danger
had
been
so
located
that
we
all
felt
free
to
inhale
the
autumn
air
and
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
the
place
without
a
thought
of
peril
lurking
in
its
sweetest
nooks
and
most
attractive
coverts
gave
to
this
short
a
distinctive
delight
aptly
expressed
by
loreen
when
she
said
i
never
knew
the
place
was
so
beautiful
why
i
think
i
can
be
happy
here
now
at
which
lucetta
grew
pensive
till
i
roused
her
by
saying
so
much
for
a
constitutional
girls
now
we
must
to
work
this
house
as
you
see
it
now
has
to
be
prepared
for
a
wedding
william
your
business
will
be
to
see
that
these
grounds
are
put
in
as
good
order
as
possible
in
the
short
time
allotted
to
you
i
will
bear
the
expense
and
loreen
but
william
had
a
word
to
say
for
himself
miss
butterworth
said
he
you
a
right
good
sort
of
woman
as
saracen
has
found
out
and
we
too
in
these
last
few
plaguy
days
but
i
not
such
a
bad
lot
either
and
if
i
do
like
my
own
way
which
may
not
be
other
people
way
and
if
i
am
sometimes
short
with
the
girls
for
some
of
their
d
d
nonsense
i
have
a
little
decency
about
me
too
and
i
promise
to
fix
these
grounds
and
out
of
my
own
money
too
now
that
nine
tenths
of
our
income
does
not
have
to
go
abroad
we
have
chink
enough
to
let
us
live
in
a
respectable
manner
once
more
in
a
place
where
one
horse
if
he
good
enough
will
give
a
fellow
a
standing
and
make
him
the
envy
of
those
who
for
some
other
pesky
reasons
may
think
themselves
called
upon
to
fight
shy
of
him
i
do
begrudge
the
old
place
a
few
dollars
especially
as
i
mean
to
live
and
die
in
it
so
look
out
you
three
women
folks
and
work
as
lively
as
you
can
on
the
inside
of
the
old
rookery
or
the
slickness
of
the
outside
will
put
you
to
open
shame
and
that
would
never
please
loreen
nor
as
i
take
it
miss
butterworth
either
it
was
a
challenge
we
were
glad
to
accept
especially
as
from
the
number
of
persons
we
now
saw
come
flocking
into
the
lane
it
was
very
apparent
that
we
should
experience
no
further
difficulty
in
obtaining
any
help
we
might
need
to
carry
out
our
undertakings
meantime
my
thoughts
were
not
altogether
concentrated
upon
these
pleasing
plans
for
lucetta
benefit
there
were
certain
points
yet
to
be
made
clear
in
the
matter
just
terminated
and
there
was
a
confession
for
me
to
make
without
which
i
could
not
face
gryce
with
all
that
unwavering
composure
which
our
peculiar
relations
seemed
to
demand
the
explanations
came
first
they
were
volunteered
by
gryce
whom
i
met
in
the
course
of
the
morning
at
mother
jane
cottage
that
old
crone
had
been
perfectly
happy
all
night
sleeping
with
the
coin
in
her
hand
and
waking
to
again
devour
it
with
her
greedy
but
loving
eyes
as
i
was
alternately
watching
her
and
gryce
who
was
directing
with
his
hand
the
movements
of
the
men
who
had
come
to
smooth
down
her
garden
and
make
it
presentable
again
the
detective
spoke
i
suppose
you
have
found
it
difficult
in
the
light
of
these
new
discoveries
to
explain
to
yourself
how
mother
jane
happened
to
have
those
trinkets
from
the
peddler
pack
and
also
how
the
ring
which
you
very
naturally
thought
must
have
been
entrusted
to
the
dove
by
chittenden
himself
came
to
be
about
its
neck
when
it
flew
home
that
day
of
chittenden
disappearance
madam
we
think
old
mother
jane
must
have
helped
herself
out
of
the
peddler
pack
before
it
was
found
in
the
woods
there
back
of
her
hut
and
of
the
other
matter
our
explanation
is
this
one
day
a
young
man
equipped
for
travelling
paused
for
a
glass
of
water
at
the
famous
well
in
trohm
garden
just
as
mother
pigeons
were
picking
up
the
corn
scattered
for
them
by
the
former
whose
tastes
are
not
confined
to
the
cultivation
of
fruits
and
flowers
but
extend
to
dumb
animals
to
whom
he
is
uniformly
kind
the
young
man
wore
a
ring
and
being
nervous
was
fiddling
with
it
as
he
talked
to
the
pleasant
old
gentleman
who
was
lowering
the
bucket
for
him
as
he
fiddled
with
it
the
earth
fell
from
under
him
and
as
the
daylight
vanished
above
his
head
the
ring
flew
from
his
hand
and
lay
the
only
token
of
his
now
existence
upon
the
emerald
sward
he
had
but
a
moment
before
pressed
with
his
unsuspicious
feet
it
burned
this
ruby
burned
like
a
drop
of
blood
in
the
grass
when
that
demon
came
again
to
his
senses
and
being
a
evidence
of
crime
in
the
eyes
of
one
who
had
allowed
nothing
to
ever
speak
against
him
in
these
matters
he
stared
at
it
as
at
a
deadly
thing
directed
against
himself
and
to
be
got
rid
of
at
once
and
by
means
which
by
no
possibility
could
recoil
back
upon
himself
as
its
author
the
pigeons
stalking
near
offered
to
his
abnormally
acute
understanding
the
only
solution
which
would
leave
him
absolutely
devoid
of
fear
he
might
have
swung
open
the
lid
of
the
well
once
more
and
flung
it
after
its
owner
but
this
meant
an
aftermath
of
experience
from
which
he
shrank
his
delight
being
in
the
thought
that
the
victims
he
saw
vanish
before
his
eyes
were
so
many
encumbrances
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
by
a
sweep
of
the
hand
to
see
or
hear
them
again
would
be
destructive
of
this
notion
he
preferred
the
subtler
way
and
to
take
advantage
of
old
mother
jane
characteristics
so
he
caught
one
of
the
pigeons
he
has
always
been
able
to
lure
birds
into
his
hands
and
tying
the
ring
around
the
neck
of
the
bird
with
a
blade
of
grass
plucked
up
from
the
highway
he
let
it
fly
and
so
was
rid
of
the
bauble
which
to
mother
jane
eyes
of
course
was
a
direct
gift
from
the
heavens
through
which
the
bird
had
flown
before
lighting
on
her
doorstep
wonderful
i
exclaimed
almost
overwhelmed
with
humiliation
but
preserving
a
brave
front
what
invention
and
what
audacity
the
invention
and
the
audacity
of
a
man
totally
irresponsible
for
his
deeds
was
it
not
i
asked
there
is
no
doubt
is
there
about
his
being
an
absolute
maniac
no
madam
what
a
relief
i
felt
at
that
word
since
we
entrapped
him
yesterday
and
he
found
himself
fully
discovered
he
has
lost
all
grip
upon
himself
and
fills
the
room
we
put
him
in
with
the
unmistakable
ravings
of
a
madman
it
was
through
these
i
learned
the
facts
i
have
just
mentioned
i
drew
a
deep
breath
we
were
standing
in
the
sight
of
several
men
and
their
presence
there
seemed
intolerable
unconsciously
i
began
to
walk
away
unconsciously
gryce
followed
me
at
the
end
of
several
paces
we
both
stopped
we
were
no
longer
visible
to
the
crowd
and
i
felt
i
could
speak
the
words
i
had
been
burning
to
say
ever
since
i
saw
the
true
nature
of
trohm
character
exposed
gryce
said
i
flushing
scarlet
which
i
here
solemnly
declare
is
something
which
has
not
happened
to
me
before
in
years
and
if
i
can
help
it
shall
never
happen
to
me
again
i
am
interested
in
what
you
say
because
yesterday
at
his
own
gateway
trohm
proposed
to
me
and
you
did
not
accept
him
no
what
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
gryce
i
did
not
accept
him
but
i
made
the
refusal
a
gentle
one
and
this
is
not
easy
work
gryce
i
interrupted
myself
to
say
with
suitable
grimness
the
same
thing
took
place
between
me
and
deacon
spear
and
to
him
i
gave
a
response
such
as
i
thought
his
presumption
warranted
the
discrimination
does
not
argue
well
for
my
astuteness
gryce
you
see
i
crave
no
credit
that
i
do
not
deserve
perhaps
you
can
not
understand
that
but
it
is
a
part
of
my
nature
madam
said
he
and
i
must
own
i
thought
his
conduct
perfect
had
i
not
been
as
completely
deceived
as
yourself
i
might
find
words
of
criticism
for
this
possibly
unprofessional
partiality
but
when
an
old
hand
like
myself
can
listen
to
the
insinuations
of
a
maniac
and
repose
as
i
must
say
i
did
repose
more
or
less
confidence
in
the
statements
he
chose
to
make
me
and
which
were
true
enough
as
to
the
facts
he
mentioned
but
wickedly
false
and
preposterously
wrong
in
suggestion
i
can
have
no
words
of
blame
for
a
woman
who
whatever
her
understanding
and
whatever
her
experience
necessarily
has
seen
less
of
human
nature
and
its
incalculable
surprises
as
to
the
more
delicate
matter
you
have
been
good
enough
to
confide
to
me
madam
i
have
but
one
remark
to
make
with
such
an
example
of
womanhood
suddenly
brought
to
their
notice
in
such
a
wild
as
this
how
could
you
expect
them
sane
or
insane
to
do
otherwise
than
they
did
i
know
many
a
worthy
man
who
would
like
to
follow
their
example
and
with
a
bow
that
left
me
speechless
gryce
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
softly
withdrew
epilogue
some
stray
leaflets
from
an
old
diary
of
althea
knollys
found
by
me
in
the
packet
left
in
my
charge
by
her
daughter
lucetta
i
never
thought
i
should
do
so
foolish
a
thing
as
begin
a
diary
when
in
my
days
which
i
am
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
i
used
to
see
meeley
butterworth
sit
down
every
night
of
her
life
over
a
little
book
which
she
called
the
repository
of
her
daily
actions
i
thought
that
if
ever
i
reached
that
point
of
imbecility
i
would
deserve
to
have
fewer
lovers
and
more
sense
just
as
she
so
frequently
advised
me
to
and
yet
here
i
am
pencil
in
hand
jotting
down
the
nothings
of
the
moment
and
with
every
prospect
of
continuing
to
do
so
for
two
weeks
at
least
for
why
was
i
born
such
a
chatterbox
i
have
seen
my
fate
and
must
talk
to
some
one
about
him
if
only
to
myself
nature
never
having
meant
me
to
keep
silence
on
any
living
topic
that
interests
me
yes
with
lovers
in
boston
lovers
in
new
york
and
a
most
determined
suitor
on
the
other
side
of
our
own
in
peekskill
i
have
fallen
victim
to
the
grave
face
and
methodical
ways
of
a
person
i
need
not
name
since
he
is
the
only
gentleman
in
this
whole
town
except
but
i
wo
except
anybody
charles
knollys
has
no
peer
here
or
anywhere
and
this
i
am
ready
to
declare
after
only
one
sight
of
his
face
and
one
look
from
his
eye
though
to
no
one
but
you
my
secret
confidant
for
to
acknowledge
to
any
human
being
that
my
admiration
could
be
caught
or
my
heart
touched
by
a
person
who
had
not
sued
two
years
at
my
feet
would
be
to
abdicate
an
ascendency
i
am
so
accustomed
to
i
could
not
see
it
vanish
without
pain
besides
who
knows
how
i
shall
feel
meeley
butterworth
never
shows
any
hesitation
in
uttering
her
opinion
either
of
men
or
things
but
then
her
opinion
never
changes
whilst
mine
is
a
very
blowing
hither
and
thither
till
i
can
not
follow
its
wanderings
myself
it
is
one
of
my
charms
certain
fools
say
but
that
is
nonsense
if
my
cheeks
lacked
color
and
my
eyes
were
without
sparkle
or
even
if
i
were
two
inches
taller
instead
of
being
the
tiniest
bit
of
mortal
flesh
to
be
found
amongst
all
the
young
ladies
of
my
age
in
our
society
i
doubt
if
the
lightness
of
my
mind
would
meet
with
the
approbation
of
even
the
warmest
of
this
time
as
it
is
it
just
passes
and
sometimes
as
for
instance
when
i
can
hardly
see
to
inscribe
these
lines
on
this
page
for
the
vision
of
two
grave
if
not
quietly
reproving
eyes
which
float
between
it
and
me
i
almost
wish
i
had
some
of
responsible
characteristics
instead
of
being
the
airiest
merriest
and
most
volatile
being
that
ever
tried
to
laugh
down
the
grandeur
of
this
dreary
old
house
with
its
century
of
memories
ah
that
allusion
has
given
me
something
to
say
this
house
what
is
there
about
it
except
its
size
to
make
a
stranger
like
me
look
back
continually
over
her
shoulder
in
going
down
the
long
halls
or
even
when
nestling
comfortably
by
the
great
in
the
immense
am
not
one
of
your
fanciful
ones
but
i
can
no
more
help
doing
this
than
i
can
help
wishing
judge
knollys
lived
in
a
less
roomy
mansion
with
fewer
echoing
corners
in
its
innumerable
passages
like
brightness
and
cheer
at
least
in
my
surroundings
if
i
must
have
gloom
or
a
seriousness
which
some
would
call
gloom
let
me
have
it
in
individuals
where
there
is
some
prospect
of
a
blithe
little
midget
effecting
a
change
and
not
in
great
towering
walls
and
endless
floors
which
no
amount
of
sunshine
or
laughter
could
ever
render
homelike
or
even
comfortable
but
there
if
one
has
the
man
one
must
have
the
home
so
i
had
better
say
no
more
against
the
home
till
i
am
quite
sure
i
do
not
want
the
man
for
well
well
i
am
not
a
fool
but
i
hear
something
just
then
a
something
which
makes
me
tremble
yet
though
i
have
spent
five
good
minutes
trilling
the
gayest
songs
i
know
i
think
it
is
very
inconsiderate
of
the
witches
to
bother
thus
a
harmless
mite
like
myself
who
only
asks
for
love
light
and
money
enough
to
buy
a
ribbon
or
a
jewel
when
the
fancy
takes
her
which
is
not
as
often
as
my
enemies
declare
and
now
a
question
why
are
my
enemies
always
to
be
found
among
the
girls
and
among
the
plainest
of
them
too
i
never
heard
a
man
say
anything
against
me
though
i
have
sometimes
surprised
a
look
on
their
faces
i
saw
it
which
might
signify
reproof
if
it
were
not
accompanied
by
a
smile
showing
anything
but
displeasure
but
this
is
a
digression
as
meeley
would
say
what
i
want
to
do
but
which
i
seem
to
find
it
very
difficult
to
do
is
to
tell
how
i
came
to
be
here
and
what
i
have
seen
since
i
came
first
then
to
be
very
short
about
the
matter
i
am
here
because
the
old
folks
that
is
my
father
and
knollys
have
decided
charles
and
i
should
know
each
other
in
thought
i
courtesy
to
the
decision
i
think
we
ought
to
too
for
while
many
other
men
are
handsomer
or
better
known
or
have
more
money
alas
than
he
he
alone
has
a
way
of
drawing
up
to
one
side
with
an
air
that
captivates
the
eye
and
sets
the
heart
trembling
a
heart
moreover
that
never
knew
before
it
could
tremble
except
in
the
presence
of
great
worldly
prosperity
and
beautiful
beautiful
things
so
as
this
experience
is
new
i
am
dutifully
obliged
for
the
excitement
it
gives
me
and
am
glad
to
be
here
awesome
as
the
place
is
and
destitute
of
any
such
pleasures
as
i
have
been
accustomed
to
in
the
gay
cities
where
i
have
hitherto
spent
most
of
my
time
but
there
i
am
rambling
again
i
have
come
to
as
you
now
see
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
and
while
this
house
is
one
of
consequence
and
has
been
the
resort
of
many
notable
people
it
is
a
little
lonesome
our
only
neighbor
being
a
young
man
who
has
a
fine
enough
appearance
but
who
has
already
shown
his
admiration
of
me
so
plainly
of
course
he
was
in
the
road
when
i
drove
up
to
the
house
that
i
lost
all
interest
in
him
at
once
such
a
nonsensical
liking
at
first
sight
being
as
i
take
it
a
tribute
only
to
my
audacious
little
travelling
bonnet
and
the
curl
or
two
which
will
fall
out
on
my
cheek
when
i
move
my
head
about
too
quickly
as
i
certainly
could
not
be
blamed
for
doing
in
driving
into
a
place
where
i
was
expected
to
make
myself
happy
for
two
weeks
he
then
is
out
of
these
chronicles
when
i
say
his
name
is
obadiah
trohm
you
will
probably
be
duly
thankful
but
he
is
not
as
stiff
and
biblical
as
his
name
would
lead
you
to
expect
on
the
contrary
he
is
lithe
graceful
and
suave
to
a
point
which
makes
charles
judicial
face
a
positive
relief
to
the
eye
and
such
little
understanding
as
has
been
accorded
me
i
can
not
write
another
word
it
is
twelve
and
though
i
have
the
cosiest
room
in
the
house
all
chintz
and
decorated
china
i
find
myself
listening
and
peering
just
as
i
did
in
their
great
barn
of
a
i
wonder
if
any
very
dreadful
things
ever
happened
in
this
house
i
will
ask
old
knollys
or
or
charles
i
am
sorry
i
was
so
inquisitive
for
the
stories
charles
told
me
i
thought
i
had
better
not
trouble
the
old
gentleman
have
only
served
to
people
the
shadows
of
this
rambling
old
house
with
figures
of
whose
acquaintance
i
am
likely
to
be
more
or
less
shy
one
tale
in
particular
gave
me
the
shivers
it
was
about
a
mother
and
daughter
who
both
loved
the
same
man
it
seems
incredible
girls
so
seldom
seeing
with
the
eyes
of
their
mothers
and
it
was
the
daughter
who
married
him
while
the
mother
fled
from
the
wedding
and
was
driven
up
to
the
great
door
here
in
a
coach
dead
they
say
that
the
coach
still
travels
the
road
just
before
some
calamity
to
the
family
a
phantom
coach
which
floats
along
in
shadow
turning
the
air
about
it
to
mist
that
chills
the
marrow
in
the
bones
of
the
unfortunate
who
sees
it
i
am
going
to
see
it
myself
some
day
the
real
coach
i
mean
in
which
this
tragic
event
took
place
it
is
still
in
the
stable
charles
tells
me
i
wonder
if
i
will
have
the
courage
to
sit
where
that
poor
devoted
mother
breathed
out
her
miserable
existence
i
shall
endeavor
to
do
so
if
only
to
defy
the
fate
which
seems
to
be
closing
in
upon
me
charles
is
an
able
lawyer
but
his
argument
in
favor
of
close
bonnets
bewitching
little
pokes
with
a
rose
or
two
in
front
was
very
weak
i
thought
he
seemed
to
think
so
himself
after
a
while
for
when
as
the
only
means
of
convincing
him
of
the
weakness
of
the
cause
he
was
advocating
i
ran
and
put
on
a
poke
similar
to
the
aforesaid
he
retracted
at
once
and
let
the
case
go
by
default
for
which
i
and
the
poke
made
suitable
acknowledgments
to
the
great
amusement
of
papa
knollys
who
was
on
my
side
from
the
first
not
much
going
on
yet
i
have
never
felt
merrier
oh
ye
hideous
bare
old
walls
wo
i
make
you
ring
if
i
wo
have
it
i
wo
have
that
smooth
persistent
hypocrite
pushing
his
way
into
my
presence
when
my
whole
heart
and
attention
belong
to
a
man
who
would
love
me
if
he
only
could
get
his
own
leave
to
do
so
obadiah
trohm
has
been
here
on
one
pretext
or
another
three
times
once
he
came
to
bring
some
very
choice
apples
as
if
i
cared
for
apples
the
second
time
he
had
a
question
of
great
importance
no
doubt
to
put
to
charles
and
as
charles
was
in
my
company
the
whole
interview
lasted
let
us
say
a
good
at
least
the
third
time
he
came
it
was
to
see
which
as
it
was
now
evening
meant
talk
talk
talk
in
the
great
with
just
a
song
interpolated
now
and
then
instead
of
a
cosy
chat
in
the
of
the
pretty
flower
parlor
with
only
one
pair
of
ears
to
please
and
one
pair
of
eyes
to
watch
master
trohm
was
intrusive
and
if
no
one
felt
it
but
myself
it
is
because
charles
knollys
has
set
himself
up
an
ideal
of
womanhood
to
which
i
am
a
contradiction
but
that
will
not
affect
the
end
a
woman
may
be
such
a
contradiction
and
yet
win
if
her
heart
is
in
the
struggle
and
she
has
besides
a
certain
individuality
of
her
own
which
appeals
to
the
eye
and
heart
if
not
to
the
understanding
i
do
not
despair
of
seeing
charles
knollys
forehead
taking
a
very
deep
frown
at
sight
of
his
handsome
and
most
attentive
neighbor
heigho
why
do
i
answer
meeley
butterworth
last
letter
am
i
ashamed
to
tell
her
that
i
have
to
limit
my
effusion
to
just
four
pages
because
i
have
commenced
a
diary
i
declare
i
begin
to
regard
it
a
misfortune
to
have
dimples
i
never
have
regarded
it
so
before
when
i
have
seen
man
after
man
succumb
to
them
but
they
have
become
my
bane
for
they
attract
two
admirers
just
at
the
time
they
should
attract
but
one
and
it
is
upon
the
wrong
man
they
flash
the
oftenest
why
i
leave
it
to
all
true
lovers
to
explain
as
a
consequence
master
trohm
is
beginning
to
assume
an
air
of
superiority
and
charles
who
may
not
believe
in
dimples
but
who
on
that
very
account
perhaps
seems
to
be
always
on
the
lookout
for
them
shrinks
more
or
less
into
the
background
as
is
not
becoming
in
a
man
with
so
many
claims
to
respect
if
not
to
love
want
to
feel
that
each
one
of
these
precious
fourteen
days
contains
all
that
it
can
of
delight
and
satisfaction
and
how
can
i
when
obadiah
oh
the
charming
and
romantic
name
holds
my
crewels
instead
of
charles
and
whispers
words
which
coming
from
other
lips
would
do
more
than
waken
my
dimples
but
if
i
must
have
a
suitor
just
when
a
suitor
is
not
wanted
let
me
at
least
make
him
useful
charles
shall
read
his
own
heart
in
this
passion
i
do
know
why
but
i
have
taken
a
dislike
to
the
flower
parlor
it
now
vies
with
the
great
in
my
disregard
yesterday
in
crossing
it
i
felt
a
chill
so
sudden
and
so
penetrating
that
i
irresistibly
thought
of
the
old
saying
some
one
is
walking
over
my
grave
grave
where
lies
it
and
why
should
i
feel
the
shudder
of
it
now
am
i
destined
to
an
early
death
the
bounding
life
in
my
veins
says
no
but
i
never
again
shall
like
that
room
it
has
made
me
think
i
have
not
only
sat
in
the
old
coach
but
i
had
let
me
drop
the
words
slowly
they
are
so
precious
i
i
have
had
a
given
me
there
charles
gave
me
this
kiss
he
could
not
help
it
i
was
sitting
on
the
seat
in
front
in
a
sort
of
mock
mirth
he
was
endeavoring
to
frown
upon
when
suddenly
i
glanced
up
and
our
eyes
met
and
he
says
it
was
the
sauciness
of
my
dimples
oh
those
old
dimples
they
seem
to
have
stood
me
in
good
stead
after
all
but
i
say
it
was
my
sincere
affection
which
drew
him
for
he
stooped
like
a
man
forgetful
of
everything
in
the
whole
wide
world
but
the
little
trembling
panting
being
before
him
and
gave
me
one
of
those
caresses
which
seals
a
woman
fate
forever
and
made
me
the
and
thoughtless
coquette
a
slave
to
this
and
man
for
all
my
life
hereafter
why
i
should
be
so
happy
over
this
event
is
beyond
my
understanding
that
he
should
be
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
is
only
to
be
expected
but
that
i
should
find
myself
tripping
through
this
gloomy
old
house
like
one
treading
on
air
is
a
mystery
to
the
elucidation
of
which
i
can
only
give
my
dimples
my
reason
can
make
nothing
out
of
it
i
who
thought
of
nothing
short
of
a
grand
establishment
in
boston
money
servants
and
a
husband
who
would
love
me
blindly
whatever
my
faults
have
given
my
troth
you
will
say
my
lips
but
the
one
means
the
other
to
a
man
who
will
never
be
known
outside
of
his
own
county
never
be
rich
never
be
blind
even
for
he
frowns
upon
me
as
often
as
he
smiles
and
worst
of
all
who
lives
in
a
house
so
vast
and
so
full
of
tragic
suggestion
that
it
might
well
awaken
doleful
anticipations
in
much
more
persons
than
myself
and
yet
i
am
happy
so
happy
that
i
have
even
attempted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
grim
old
portraits
and
weak
pastels
which
line
the
walls
of
many
of
these
bedrooms
old
knollys
caught
me
courtesying
just
now
before
one
of
these
ancestral
beauties
whose
face
seemed
to
hold
a
faint
prophecy
of
my
own
and
perceiving
by
my
blushes
that
this
was
something
more
than
a
mere
childish
freak
on
my
part
he
chucked
me
under
the
chin
and
laughingly
asked
how
long
it
was
likely
to
be
before
he
might
have
the
honor
of
adding
my
pretty
face
to
the
collection
which
should
have
made
me
indignant
only
i
am
not
in
an
indignant
mood
just
now
why
have
i
been
so
foolish
why
did
i
not
let
my
neighbor
know
from
the
beginning
that
i
detested
him
instead
of
but
what
have
i
done
anyway
a
smile
a
nod
a
laughing
word
mean
nothing
when
one
has
eyes
which
persist
in
dancing
in
spite
of
one
every
effort
to
keep
them
demure
men
who
become
fools
are
apt
to
call
one
a
coquette
when
a
little
good
sense
would
teach
them
that
the
woman
who
smiles
always
has
some
other
way
of
showing
her
regard
to
the
man
she
really
favors
i
could
not
help
being
on
merry
terms
with
trohm
if
only
to
hide
the
effect
another
presence
has
on
me
but
he
thinks
otherwise
and
i
had
ample
reason
for
seeing
why
his
good
looks
and
easy
manners
have
invariably
awakened
distrust
in
me
rather
than
admiration
master
trohm
is
vindictive
and
i
should
be
afraid
of
him
if
i
had
not
observed
in
him
the
presence
of
another
passion
which
will
soon
engross
all
his
attention
and
make
him
forget
me
as
soon
as
ever
i
become
charles
wife
money
is
his
idol
and
as
fortune
seems
to
favor
him
he
will
soon
be
happy
in
the
mere
pleasure
of
accumulation
but
this
is
not
relating
what
happened
we
were
walking
in
the
shrubbery
by
i
naturally
mean
charles
and
myself
and
he
was
saying
things
which
made
me
at
the
same
time
happy
and
a
bit
serious
when
i
suddenly
felt
myself
under
the
spell
of
some
baleful
influence
that
filled
me
with
a
dismay
i
could
neither
understand
nor
escape
from
as
this
could
not
proceed
from
charles
i
turned
to
look
about
me
when
i
encountered
the
eyes
of
obadiah
trohm
who
was
leaning
on
the
fence
separating
his
grounds
from
those
of
knollys
looking
directly
at
us
if
i
flinched
at
this
surveillance
it
was
but
the
natural
expression
of
my
indignation
his
face
wore
a
look
calculated
to
frighten
any
one
and
though
he
did
not
respond
to
the
gesture
i
made
him
i
felt
that
my
only
chance
of
escaping
a
scene
was
to
induce
charles
to
leave
me
before
he
should
see
what
i
saw
in
the
lowering
countenance
of
his
intrusive
neighbor
as
the
situation
demanded
and
the
exercise
of
a
ready
wit
and
as
these
are
qualities
in
which
i
am
not
altogether
deficient
i
succeeded
in
carrying
out
my
intention
sooner
even
than
i
expected
charles
hurried
from
my
presence
at
the
first
word
and
proceeded
towards
the
house
without
seeing
trohm
and
i
quivering
with
dread
turned
towards
the
man
whom
i
felt
rather
than
saw
approaching
me
he
met
me
with
a
look
i
shall
never
forget
i
have
had
lovers
too
many
of
them
and
this
is
not
the
first
man
i
have
been
compelled
to
meet
with
rebuff
and
disdain
but
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
none
too
extended
existence
have
i
been
confronted
by
such
passion
or
overwhelmed
with
such
bitter
recrimination
he
seemed
like
a
man
beside
himself
yet
he
was
quiet
too
quiet
and
while
his
voice
did
not
rise
above
a
whisper
and
he
approached
no
nearer
than
the
demands
of
courtesy
required
he
produced
so
terrifying
an
effect
upon
me
that
i
longed
to
cry
for
help
and
would
have
done
so
but
that
my
throat
closed
with
fright
and
i
could
only
gurgle
forth
a
remonstrance
too
faint
even
for
him
to
hear
you
have
played
with
a
man
best
feelings
he
said
you
have
led
me
to
believe
that
i
had
only
to
speak
to
have
you
for
my
own
are
you
simply
foolish
or
are
you
wicked
did
you
care
for
me
at
all
or
was
it
only
your
wish
to
increase
the
number
of
men
in
your
train
this
one
here
his
hand
pointed
quiveringly
towards
the
house
has
enjoyed
a
happiness
denied
me
his
hand
has
touched
yours
his
lips
here
his
words
became
almost
unintelligible
till
his
purpose
gave
him
strength
and
he
cried
but
notwithstanding
this
notwithstanding
any
vows
you
may
have
exchanged
i
have
claims
upon
you
that
i
will
not
yield
i
who
have
loved
no
woman
before
you
will
have
such
a
hand
in
your
fate
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
separate
yourself
from
the
influence
i
shall
exert
over
you
i
will
not
intrude
between
you
and
your
lover
i
will
not
affect
dislike
or
disturb
your
outer
life
with
any
vain
display
of
my
hatred
or
my
passion
but
i
will
work
upon
your
secret
thoughts
and
create
a
slowly
increasing
dread
in
the
inner
sanctuary
of
your
heart
till
you
wish
you
had
called
up
the
deadliest
of
serpents
in
your
pathway
rather
than
the
latent
fury
of
obadiah
trohm
you
are
a
girl
now
when
you
are
married
and
become
a
mother
you
will
understand
me
for
the
present
i
leave
you
the
shadow
of
this
old
house
which
has
never
seen
much
happiness
within
it
will
soon
rest
upon
your
thoughtless
head
what
that
will
not
do
your
own
inherent
weakness
will
the
woman
who
trifles
with
a
strong
man
heart
has
a
flaw
in
her
nature
which
will
work
out
her
own
destruction
in
time
i
can
afford
to
let
you
enjoy
your
prospective
honeymoon
in
peace
afterwards
he
cast
a
threatening
look
towards
the
decaying
structure
behind
me
and
was
silent
but
that
silence
did
not
unloose
my
tongue
i
was
absolutely
speechless
ten
brides
have
crossed
yonder
threshold
he
presently
went
on
in
a
low
musing
tone
freighted
with
horrible
fatality
one
and
she
was
the
girl
whose
mother
was
driven
up
to
these
doors
dead
lived
to
take
her
grandchildren
on
her
knees
the
rest
died
early
and
most
of
them
unhappily
oh
i
have
studied
the
traditions
of
your
future
home
will
live
but
of
all
the
brides
who
have
triumphed
in
the
honorable
name
of
knollys
you
will
lead
the
saddest
life
and
meet
the
gloomiest
end
notwithstanding
you
stand
before
me
now
with
loose
locks
flying
in
the
wind
and
a
heart
so
gay
that
even
my
despair
can
barely
pale
the
roses
on
your
cheek
this
was
the
raving
of
a
madman
i
recognized
it
as
such
and
took
a
little
heart
how
could
he
see
into
my
future
how
could
he
prophesy
evil
to
one
over
whom
he
will
have
no
control
to
one
watched
over
and
beloved
by
a
man
like
charles
he
is
a
dreamer
a
fanatic
his
talk
about
the
flaw
in
my
nature
is
nonsense
and
as
for
the
fate
lowering
over
my
head
in
the
shadows
falling
from
the
toppling
old
house
in
which
i
am
likely
to
take
up
my
abode
that
is
only
frenzy
and
i
would
be
unworthy
of
happiness
to
heed
it
as
i
realized
this
my
indignation
grew
and
uttering
a
few
contemptuous
words
i
was
hurrying
away
when
he
stopped
me
with
a
final
warning
wait
he
said
women
like
you
can
not
keep
either
their
joys
or
their
miseries
to
themselves
but
i
advise
you
not
to
take
charles
knollys
into
your
confidence
if
you
do
a
duel
will
follow
and
if
i
have
not
the
legal
acumen
of
your
intended
i
have
an
eye
and
a
hand
before
which
he
must
fall
if
our
passions
come
to
an
issue
so
beware
never
while
you
live
betray
what
has
passed
between
us
at
this
interview
unless
the
weariness
of
a
misplaced
affection
should
come
to
you
and
with
it
the
desire
to
be
rid
of
your
husband
a
frightful
threat
which
unfortunately
perhaps
has
sealed
my
lips
oh
why
should
such
monsters
live
i
have
been
all
through
the
house
with
old
knollys
every
room
was
opened
for
my
inspection
and
i
was
bidden
to
choose
which
should
be
refurnished
for
my
benefit
it
was
a
gruesome
trip
from
which
i
have
returned
to
my
own
little
nook
of
chintz
as
to
a
refuge
great
rooms
which
for
years
have
been
the
abode
of
spiders
are
not
much
to
my
liking
but
i
chose
out
two
which
at
least
have
fireplaces
in
them
and
these
are
to
be
made
as
cheerful
as
circumstances
will
permit
i
hope
when
i
again
see
them
it
will
not
be
by
the
light
of
a
waning
november
afternoon
when
the
few
leaves
still
left
to
flutter
from
the
trees
blow
soggy
and
wet
against
the
panes
of
the
solitary
windows
or
lie
in
sodden
masses
at
the
foot
of
the
bare
trunks
which
cluster
so
thickly
on
the
lawn
as
to
hide
all
view
of
the
highroad
i
was
meant
for
laughter
and
joy
flashing
lights
and
the
splendors
of
ballrooms
why
have
i
chosen
then
to
give
up
the
great
world
and
settle
down
in
this
grimmest
of
grim
old
houses
in
a
none
too
lively
village
i
think
it
is
because
i
love
charles
knollys
and
so
no
matter
how
my
heart
sinks
in
the
dim
shadows
that
haunt
every
spot
i
stray
into
i
will
be
merry
will
think
of
charles
instead
of
myself
and
so
live
down
the
unhappy
prophecies
uttered
by
the
wretch
who
with
his
venomous
words
has
robbed
the
future
of
whatever
charm
my
love
was
likely
to
cast
upon
it
the
fact
that
this
man
left
the
town
for
a
lengthy
trip
abroad
should
raise
my
spirits
more
than
it
has
if
we
were
going
now
charles
and
i
but
why
dream
of
a
paradise
whose
doors
remain
closed
to
you
it
is
here
our
honeymoon
is
destined
to
be
passed
within
these
walls
and
in
sight
of
the
bare
boughs
rattling
at
this
moment
against
the
panes
i
made
a
misstatement
when
i
said
that
i
had
gone
into
all
the
rooms
of
the
house
this
afternoon
did
not
enter
the
flower
i
had
been
married
a
month
and
had
as
i
thought
no
further
use
for
this
foolish
diary
so
one
evening
when
charles
was
away
i
attempted
to
burn
it
but
when
i
had
flung
myself
down
before
the
blazing
logs
of
my
bedroom
fire
i
was
then
young
enough
to
love
to
crouch
for
hours
on
the
rug
in
my
lonely
room
seeking
for
all
i
delighted
in
and
longed
for
in
the
glowing
embers
some
instinct
or
was
it
a
premonition
made
me
withhold
from
destruction
a
record
which
coming
events
might
make
worthy
of
preservation
that
was
five
years
ago
and
i
have
reopened
the
secret
drawer
in
which
this
simple
book
has
so
long
lain
undisturbed
and
am
once
more
penning
lines
destined
perhaps
to
pass
into
oblivion
together
with
the
others
why
i
do
not
know
there
is
no
change
in
my
married
life
i
have
no
trouble
no
anxiety
no
reason
for
dread
yet
well
well
some
women
are
made
for
the
simple
round
of
domestic
duties
and
others
are
as
out
of
place
in
the
nursery
and
kitchen
as
butterflies
in
a
granary
i
want
just
the
things
charles
can
not
give
me
i
have
home
love
children
all
that
some
women
most
crave
and
while
i
idolize
my
husband
and
know
of
nothing
sweeter
than
my
babies
i
yet
have
spells
of
such
wretched
weariness
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
me
to
be
a
little
less
comfortable
if
only
i
might
enjoy
a
more
brilliant
existence
but
charles
is
not
rich
sometimes
i
think
he
is
poor
and
however
much
i
may
desire
change
i
can
not
have
it
heigho
and
what
is
worse
i
have
had
a
new
dress
in
a
year
i
who
so
love
dress
and
become
it
so
well
why
if
it
is
my
lot
to
go
shabby
and
tie
up
my
dancing
ringlets
with
faded
ribbons
was
i
made
with
the
figure
of
a
fairy
and
given
a
temperament
which
without
any
effort
on
my
part
makes
me
diminutive
as
i
am
the
centre
of
every
group
i
enter
if
i
were
plain
or
shy
or
even
i
might
be
happy
here
but
now
there
there
i
will
go
kiss
little
william
and
lay
loreen
baby
arm
about
my
neck
and
see
if
the
wicked
demons
will
fly
away
charles
is
too
busy
for
me
to
intrude
upon
him
in
that
horrid
flower
parlor
i
was
never
superstitious
till
i
entered
this
house
but
now
i
believe
in
every
sort
of
thing
a
sane
woman
should
not
yesterday
after
a
neglect
of
five
years
i
brought
out
my
diary
i
have
to
record
in
it
that
there
was
a
reason
for
my
doing
so
obadiah
trohm
has
returned
home
i
saw
him
this
morning
leaning
over
his
fence
in
the
same
place
and
in
very
much
the
same
attitude
as
on
that
day
when
he
frightened
me
so
a
month
before
my
wedding
but
he
did
not
frighten
me
he
merely
looked
at
me
very
sharply
and
with
a
less
offensive
admiration
than
in
the
early
days
of
our
first
acquaintance
at
which
i
made
him
my
best
courtesy
i
was
not
going
to
remind
him
of
the
past
in
our
new
relations
and
he
thankful
perhaps
for
this
took
off
his
hat
with
a
smile
i
am
trying
even
yet
to
explain
to
myself
then
we
began
to
talk
he
had
travelled
everywhere
and
i
had
been
nowhere
he
wore
the
dress
and
displayed
the
manners
of
the
great
world
while
i
had
only
a
hungry
desire
to
do
the
same
as
for
fashion
i
needed
all
my
beauty
and
the
fading
sparkle
of
my
old
animation
to
enable
me
to
hold
up
my
head
before
him
but
as
for
liking
him
i
did
not
i
could
admire
his
appearance
but
he
himself
attracted
me
no
more
than
when
he
had
words
of
angry
fury
on
his
tongue
he
is
a
gentleman
and
one
who
has
seen
the
world
but
in
other
ways
he
is
no
more
to
be
compared
with
my
charles
than
his
pert
new
house
built
in
his
absence
with
the
grand
old
structure
with
whose
fatality
he
once
threatened
me
i
do
not
think
he
wants
to
threaten
me
with
disaster
now
time
closes
such
wounds
as
his
very
effectually
i
wish
we
had
some
of
his
money
i
have
always
heard
that
the
wives
of
the
knollys
whatever
their
misfortune
have
always
loved
their
husbands
i
do
not
think
i
am
any
exception
to
the
rule
when
charles
has
leisure
to
give
me
an
hour
from
his
musty
old
books
the
place
here
seems
lively
enough
and
the
children
voices
do
not
sound
so
shrill
but
these
hours
are
so
infrequent
if
it
were
not
for
trohm
journal
did
i
mention
that
he
had
lent
me
a
journal
of
his
travels
i
should
often
eat
my
heart
out
with
loneliness
i
am
beginning
to
like
the
man
better
as
i
follow
him
from
city
to
city
of
the
old
world
if
he
had
ever
mentioned
me
in
its
pages
i
would
not
read
another
line
in
it
but
he
seems
to
have
expended
both
his
love
and
spite
when
he
bade
me
farewell
in
the
garden
underlying
these
bleak
old
walls
i
am
becoming
as
well
acquainted
with
trohm
handwriting
as
with
my
own
i
read
and
read
and
read
in
his
journal
and
only
stop
when
the
dreaded
midnight
hour
comes
with
its
ghostly
suggestions
and
the
unaccountable
noises
which
make
this
old
dwelling
so
uncanny
charles
often
finds
me
curled
up
over
this
book
and
when
he
does
he
sighs
why
i
have
been
teaching
loreen
to
dance
oh
how
merry
it
has
made
me
i
think
i
will
be
happier
now
we
have
the
large
upper
hall
to
take
steps
in
and
when
she
makes
a
misstep
we
laugh
and
that
is
a
good
sound
to
hear
in
this
old
place
if
i
could
only
have
a
little
money
to
buy
her
a
fresh
frock
and
some
ribbons
i
would
feel
perfectly
satisfied
but
i
do
believe
charles
is
getting
poorer
and
poorer
every
day
the
place
costs
so
much
to
keep
up
he
says
and
when
his
father
died
there
were
debts
to
be
paid
which
leaves
us
his
innocent
inheritors
very
straitened
master
trohm
has
no
such
difficulties
he
has
money
enough
but
i
like
the
man
for
all
that
polite
as
he
is
to
us
all
he
seems
to
quite
adore
loreen
and
as
to
william
he
pets
him
till
i
feel
almost
uncomfortable
at
times
what
shall
i
do
i
am
invited
to
new
york
and
charles
says
i
may
go
too
only
i
have
nothing
to
wear
oh
for
some
money
a
little
money
it
is
my
right
to
have
some
money
but
charles
tells
me
he
can
only
spare
enough
to
pay
my
expenses
that
my
sunday
frock
looks
very
well
and
that
even
if
it
did
not
i
am
pretty
enough
to
do
without
fine
clothes
and
other
nonsense
like
that
sweet
enough
but
totally
without
point
in
fact
if
i
am
pretty
all
the
more
i
need
a
little
finery
to
set
me
off
and
besides
to
go
to
new
york
without
money
why
i
should
be
perfectly
miserable
charles
himself
ought
to
realize
this
and
be
willing
to
sell
his
old
books
before
he
would
let
me
go
into
this
whirl
of
temptation
without
a
dollar
to
spend
as
he
do
i
must
devise
some
plan
of
my
own
for
obtaining
a
little
money
for
i
wo
give
up
my
trip
the
first
offered
me
since
i
was
married
and
neither
will
i
go
away
and
come
back
without
a
gift
for
my
two
girls
who
have
grown
to
womanhood
without
a
jewel
to
adorn
them
or
a
silk
dress
to
make
them
look
like
gentlemen
children
but
how
get
money
without
charles
knowing
it
trohm
is
such
a
good
friend
he
might
lend
me
a
little
but
i
do
know
how
to
ask
him
without
recalling
to
his
mind
certain
words
long
since
forgotten
by
him
perhaps
but
never
to
be
forgotten
by
me
as
many
people
think
me
is
there
any
one
else
i
wonder
if
some
things
are
as
wicked
as
people
say
they
are
i
here
the
diary
breaks
off
abruptly
but
we
know
what
followed
the
forgery
the
discovery
of
it
by
her
suave
but
secret
enemy
his
unnatural
revenge
and
the
enmity
which
led
to
the
tragic
events
it
has
been
my
unhappy
fortune
to
relate
at
such
length
