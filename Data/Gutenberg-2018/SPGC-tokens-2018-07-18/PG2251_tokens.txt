notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors

notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

any

you

with
my
spelling
choices
please
feel
free

what
yesternight

this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
downe
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heauy
newes
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wilde
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
and
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
vpon
whose
dead
corpes
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shamelesse
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
or
spoken
of
king
it
seemes
then
that
the

you
were
about

speake
north
yea
my
good
lord
those
prisoners
in
your
highnesse
demanded
which
harry
percy
heere
at
holmedon
tooke
were
as
he
sayes
not
with
such
strength
denied
as
was
deliuered
to
your
maiesty
who
either
through
enuy
or
misprision
was
guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my
sonne
hot
my
liege
i
did
deny
no
prisoners
but
i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreame
toyle
breathlesse
and
faint
leaning
vpon
my
sword
came
there
a
certaine
lord
neat
and
trimly
drest
fresh
as
a
and
his
chin
new
reapt
shew
like
a
stubble
land
at
haruest
home
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
his
finger
and
his
thumbe
he
held
a
which
euer
and
anon
he
gaue
his
nose
and
away
againe
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
tooke
it
in
snuffe
and
still
he
smil
and
talk
and
as
the
souldiers
bare
dead
bodies
by
he
call
them
vntaught
knaues
vnmannerly
to
bring
a
slouenly
vnhandsome
coarse
betwixt
the
winde
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
tearme
he
question
me
among
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your
maiesties
behalfe
i
then
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
pestered
with
a
popingay
out
of
my
greefe
and
my
impatience
answer
neglectingly
i
know
not
what
he
should
or
should
not
for
he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
briske
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talke
so
like
a
of
guns
drums
and
wounds
god
saue
the
marke
and
telling
me
the
thing
on
earth
was
parmacity
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pitty
so
it
was
that
villanous
should
be
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmlesse
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
gunnes
he
would
himselfe
haue
beene
a
souldier
this
bald
vnioynted
chat
of
his
my
lord
made
me
to
answer
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you
let
not
this
report
come
currant
for
an
accusation
betwixt
my
loue
and
your
high
maiesty
blunt
the
circumstance
considered
good
my
lord
what
euer
harry
percie
then
had
said
to
such
a
person
and
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
with
all
the
rest
retold
may
reasonably
dye
and
neuer
rise
to
do
him
wrong
or
any
way
impeach
what
then
he
said
so
he
vnsay
it
now
king
why
yet
doth
deny
his
prisoners
but
with
prouiso
and
exception
that
we
at
our
owne
charge
shall
ransome
straight
his
the
foolish
mortimer
who
in
my
soule
hath
wilfully
betraid
the
liues
of
those
that
he
did
leade
to
fight
against
the
great
magitian
damn
glendower
whose

that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those

wounds
which
valiantly
he
tooke
when
on
the
gentle
seuernes
siedgie

did
confound
the
best
part
of
an

in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breath
and
three
times
did
they
drink
vpon
agreement
of
swift
seuernes
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
lookes
ran
fearefully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
in
the
hollow
banke
with
these
valiant
combatants

did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
neuer

then
i
can
not

might
weare
without
all
her

king
heauen
pardon

yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy

which
doe
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the

thy

beene
so
common
hackney
in

so
stale

cheape
to

opinion
that
did
helpe
me
to

had
still
kept
loyall
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputelesse
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
marke
nor
likelyhood
by
being
seldome
seene
i
could
not
stirre
but
like
a
comet
i
was
wondred
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
this
is
hee
others
would
say
where
which
is
bullingbrooke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesie
from
heauen
and
drest
my
selfe
in
such
humilitie
that
i
did
plucke
allegeance
from
mens
hearts
lowd
showts
and
salutations
from
their
mouthes
euen
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
i
did
keepe
my

fresh

new
my

like
a

pontificall
ne
seene

wondred
at
and
so
my

sumptuous
shewed

ambled
vp

downe
with
shallow

rash
bauin
wits
soone
kindled
and
soone
burnt
carded
his

mingled
his
royaltie
with
carping
fooles
had
his
great
name
prophaned
with
their
scornes
and
gaue
his
countenance
against

at

thence
he
was
much
fear

doth
infect
the
very
of

catching
hither
euen
to

he
writes
me
here
that
inward
sicknesse
and
that
his

drawne
nor
did
he
thinke
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous

deare
a

soule
remou
but
on
his

yet
doth
he
giue
vs
bold
aduertisement
that
with
our
small
coniunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
dispos

for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the

is
certainely
possest
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
wor
your

sicknesse
is
a
mayme
to

a
perillous
gash
a
very
limme
lopt
off

yet
in

it

finde
it
were
it
good
to
set
the

so
wee
should
where

we
may
boldly
spend
vpon
the

of
what
is
to
come
in

not
why
he
is
away
that
wisedome
loyaltie
and
meere
dislike
of

kept
the

breede
a

you

then
if

to

good

what
with
owen
glendowers
absence
thence
who
with

was
rated
firmely
too
and
comes
not
in

i
feare
the

is
too
weake
to
wage
an

tryall
with
the

sir
why
my
good
