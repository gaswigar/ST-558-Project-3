room
he
recalls
the
events
that
led
him
to
this
bitter
hour
daoud
was
born
to
an
english
crusading
family
that
had
settled
in
palestine
captured
by
muslims
as
a
child
he
was
taken
to
el
kahira
cairo
chief
city
of
egypt
and
selected
for
the
mamelukes
the
elite
corps
of
slave
warriors
gathered
from
all
parts
of
the
middle
east
to
serve
the
sultans
of
el
kahira
he
became
a
favorite
of
a
leading
mameluke
emir
baibars
young
and
in
need
of
comfort
he
converted
to
islam
he
came
to
love
the
faith
of
muhammad
totally
and
humbly
dedicating
himself
to
its
tenets
and
to
the
welfare
of
the
muslim
people
he
studied
with
sheikh
saadi
a
sufi
mystic
and
with
the
hashishiyya
the
dreaded
sect
known
in
europe
as
the
assassins
in
those
years
the
tartars
invincible
legions
of
mounted
barbarians
had
come
out
of
asia
invading
the
islamic
world
a
huge
army
led
by
hulagu
grandson
of
the
tartar
conqueror
genghis
khan
had
already
conquered
persia
and
syria
and
was
poised
to
attack
egypt
and
hulagu
was
sending
ambassadors
to
the
pope
to
urge
christian
europe
to
join
with
the
tartars
in
destroying
the
muslims
should
tartars
and
crusaders
strike
at
egypt
simultaneously
the
people
and
faith
daoud
has
come
to
love
would
perish
daoud
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
how
the
tartars
obliterated
baghdad
its
men
women
and
children
slaughtered
to
the
last
soul
the
city
leveled
a
wasteland
he
is
determined
that
the
same
fate
not
befall
his
adopted
el
kahira
baibars
having
made
himself
sultan
of
el
kahira
sent
daoud
into
the
land
of
the
infidel
because
daoud
is
blond
and
no
one
would
ever
suspect
him
to
be
a
saracen
as
christians
call
all
muslims
daoud
mission
was
to
go
to
the
court
of
the
pope
and
use
every
means
necessary
from
intrigue
and
bribery
to
assassination
and
outright
war
to
stop
christians
and
tartars
from
forming
an
alliance
against
islam
he
went
first
to
manfred
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
king
manfred
family
the
imperial
german
house
of
hohenstaufen
had
been
at
war
with
the
popes
for
generations
and
manfred
had
among
his
subjects
many
sicilian
muslims
manfred
agreed
to
help
daoud
but
to
protect
his
own
interests
manfred
insisted
that
daoud
take
with
him
lorenzo
celino
a
sicilian
warrior
and
sophia
karaiannides
a
beautiful
byzantine
woman
lorenzo
brought
along
his
huge
formidable
dog
scipio
journeying
northward
the
three
rescued
rachel
a
jewish
girl
from
tavern
ruffians
daoud
agreed
with
misgivings
to
let
her
travel
with
them
the
pope
threatened
by
political
violence
in
rome
had
moved
his
residence
to
orvieto
a
strongly
walled
town
built
on
a
huge
rock
here
cardinal
adelberto
ugolini
a
sicilian
churchman
who
had
long
been
secretly
sending
information
to
baibars
was
horrified
to
find
baibars
agent
on
his
doorstep
expecting
hospitality
but
the
cardinal
reluctantly
agreed
to
help
hulagu
khan
ambassadors
to
the
pope
christianized
tartars
named
john
chagan
and
philip
uzbek
arrived
in
orvieto
two
weeks
after
daoud
a
young
french
nobleman
count
simon
de
gobignon
commanded
their
military
escort
daoud
had
arranged
for
hecklers
to
mar
the
ambassadors
procession
the
arrogant
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
accompanying
the
tartars
was
hit
by
excrement
he
ordered
the
hired
venetian
crossbowmen
to
fire
into
the
crowd
killing
two
innocent
bystanders
calling
himself
david
of
trebizond
a
merchant
from
the
eastern
shore
of
the
black
sea
daoud
appeared
publicly
for
the
first
time
at
a
council
of
church
leaders
called
by
pope
urban
he
spoke
from
firsthand
knowledge
of
the
horrors
committed
by
the
tartars
but
friar
mathieu
the
tartars
interpreter
testified
that
in
his
opinion
the
tartar
empire
was
no
longer
a
danger
to
europe
the
tartar
ambassadors
and
their
entourage
were
guests
at
the
palace
of
orvieto
most
powerful
family
the
monaldeschi
when
contessa
elvira
di
monaldeschi
gave
a
reception
for
the
emissaries
daoud
drew
them
into
drunken
gloating
over
their
atrocities
and
boasting
of
their
plans
for
world
conquest
pope
urban
and
many
other
church
dignitaries
were
appalled
listeners
with
ugolini
help
daoud
was
able
to
persuade
the
influential
dominican
philosopher
fra
tomasso
to
write
and
preach
against
the
alliance
but
then
subjected
to
unknown
pressures
fra
tomasso
suddenly
changed
his
position
daoud
now
felt
that
he
could
do
no
more
through
intrigue
he
had
been
in
contact
with
the
filippeschi
an
orvieto
clan
who
were
hereditary
enemies
of
the
monaldeschi
family
and
through
lorenzo
he
had
been
quietly
recruiting
a
company
of
bravos
armed
adventurers
offering
the
help
of
his
mercenaries
he
persuaded
the
filippeschi
to
attack
the
monaldeschi
palace
with
de
gobignon
and
the
tartars
other
guards
diverted
he
could
enter
the
palace
and
kill
the
ambassadors
while
the
filippeschi
prepared
for
the
attack
daoud
discovered
that
andrea
sordello
one
of
his
hired
bravos
had
been
set
to
spy
on
him
by
simon
de
gobignon
in
tilia
brothel
daoud
subjected
sordello
to
a
hashishiyya
initiation
using
drugs
and
women
to
make
the
spy
his
slave
he
implanted
in
sordello
mind
a
command
that
if
he
should
see
a
silver
locket
that
daoud
keeps
on
his
person
he
would
immediately
kill
simon
de
gobignon
and
henceforth
sordello
was
to
give
simon
only
the
information
daoud
wanted
him
to
have
after
the
initiation
daoud
was
troubled
he
had
been
taught
how
to
do
this
but
had
never
done
it
before
had
he
truly
and
completely
subjugated
sordello
soul
on
the
night
of
the
attack
he
was
dismayed
to
discover
the
monaldeschi
ready
for
a
siege
but
garbed
in
black
as
a
hashishiyya
fighter
daoud
went
ahead
and
slipped
into
the
monaldeschi
palace
the
tartars
with
simon
de
gobignon
friar
mathieu
and
four
guards
were
in
the
most
secure
room
in
the
palace
the
cellar
pantry
where
costly
spices
from
the
east
were
kept
behind
a
thick
door
with
a
strong
lock
trained
by
the
hashishiyya
to
use
his
senses
other
than
sight
to
fight
in
the
dark
daoud
forced
his
way
into
the
spice
pantry
and
put
out
the
lantern
he
struggled
with
simon
in
pitch
blackness
and
came
close
to
killing
him
swords
thrust
at
him
from
all
directions
he
had
the
tartars
lives
almost
in
his
grasp
but
de
gobignon
was
thwarting
him
he
tried
frantically
to
kill
de
gobignon
and
was
no
more
able
to
do
it
than
if
the
man
were
a
djinn
then
the
old
priest
escaped
from
the
cellar
and
came
back
with
a
lighted
candle
gripped
by
the
terrible
fear
that
he
would
be
caught
and
exposed
daoud
raced
up
the
cellar
stairs
despair
almost
killed
him
when
he
felt
the
searing
pain
of
a
tartar
arrow
in
his
leg
he
felt
terror
when
he
saw
the
friar
on
the
stairs
blocking
his
way
even
though
the
old
man
held
no
weapon
in
his
outstretched
arms
he
had
been
about
to
stab
the
friar
who
was
too
useful
to
the
tartars
and
the
christians
to
be
allowed
to
live
but
his
arm
could
not
move
it
was
as
if
a
powerful
hand
held
it
and
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
booming
in
his
head
dare
to
murder
a
priest
in
his
dread
he
hesitated
but
if
he
did
not
escape
sophia
would
die
the
moment
of
paralysis
passed
and
instead
of
killing
friar
mathieu
he
thrust
him
aside
to
fall
from
the
banisterless
stairs
as
he
lies
in
bed
the
following
morning
in
ugolini
mansion
daoud
forces
himself
to
think
he
has
extended
himself
to
the
limit
of
his
powers
and
failed
but
he
must
try
again
he
has
to
find
a
new
plan
lest
his
faith
and
his
people
his
whole
world
meet
annihilation
in
a
room
near
daoud
sophia
karaiannides
kneels
before
an
icon
of
saint
simon
stylites
that
she
herself
painted
she
is
thankful
that
daoud
escaped
alive
from
the
monaldeschi
palace
she
is
glad
that
simon
who
coincidentally
shares
the
name
of
her
favorite
saint
is
alive
too
but
how
much
longer
she
wonders
will
she
have
to
live
here
in
the
midst
of
enemies
with
the
fear
of
a
hideous
death
as
a
spy
and
an
enemy
of
the
church
dogging
her
day
and
night
sophia
was
born
in
constantinople
during
the
years
when
it
was
ruled
by
french
invaders
as
a
very
young
woman
she
had
seen
her
parents
and
her
lover
slaughtered
by
rampaging
french
troops
she
went
on
to
serve
the
byzantine
general
michael
paleologos
who
drove
out
the
french
and
became
the
basileus
emperor
of
constantinople
michael
sent
sophia
as
a
confidential
envoy
to
his
ally
manfred
and
she
and
manfred
became
lovers
but
when
the
blond
saracen
who
called
himself
david
of
trebizond
arrived
at
manfred
court
manfred
told
her
she
must
help
david
in
his
mission
of
preventing
the
alliance
manfred
hinted
at
danger
to
her
if
she
stayed
with
him
though
heartbroken
at
being
sent
away
by
manfred
sophia
accepted
the
undertaking
because
another
french
crusade
might
well
lead
to
another
french
attack
on
the
polis
her
beloved
home
city
when
rachel
joined
their
party
sophia
remembering
her
own
orphan
girlhood
befriended
her
but
daoud
insisted
to
protect
the
secrecy
of
the
mission
that
after
they
arrived
in
orvieto
rachel
be
sent
to
the
brothel
run
by
tilia
caballo
cardinal
ugolini
mistress
after
a
few
months
in
daoud
company
sophia
felt
powerfully
attracted
to
him
the
saracen
admitted
that
he
was
likewise
drawn
to
her
but
insisted
that
they
deny
any
loving
feelings
because
he
must
use
sophia
to
corrupt
and
defeat
the
advocates
of
the
alliance
and
he
did
so
at
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
reception
for
the
tartars
sending
sophia
to
lure
simon
de
gobignon
away
from
the
great
hall
of
the
palace
while
he
tempted
the
tartars
to
discredit
themselves
sophia
and
simon
went
for
a
walk
in
the
atrium
and
in
a
dark
corner
she
let
him
kiss
her
a
month
after
the
reception
simon
and
she
had
a
clandestine
tryst
in
her
room
at
ugolini
though
she
was
ready
to
take
him
to
bed
simon
insisted
that
they
remain
chaste
according
to
the
customs
of
courtly
love
thereby
endearing
himself
to
her
all
the
more
she
is
surprised
to
realize
that
she
has
come
to
care
deeply
for
the
idealistic
innocent
young
frenchman
but
her
feeling
for
the
saracen
is
stronger
more
than
once
the
ruthless
things
daoud
has
done
in
pursuit
of
his
mission
have
made
her
almost
hate
him
even
so
when
sophia
is
with
daoud
she
feels
a
fire
building
in
herself
to
match
the
fire
she
perceives
behind
those
gray
eyes
she
glances
at
an
hourglass
sighs
and
rises
from
where
she
has
been
kneeling
before
the
saint
icon
it
is
time
to
prepare
a
fresh
poultice
for
daoud
wound
morning
at
the
palazzo

the
dead
are
laid
out
and
wept
over
the
debris
of
the

cleared

begun

the
damaged

simon
de
gobignon
strips
off
his
mail
shirt
about
to
step
into
a
hot
bath
he
is
profoundly
grateful
to
be
alive
and
relieved
that
he
successfully
protected
the
tartar
ambassadors
from
being
murdered
by
the
man
in
black
but
relief
turns
to
anguish
each
time
he
is
reminded
that
his
friend
and
adviser
friar
mathieu
has
been
cruelly
hurt
by
his
fall
and
may
yet
die
count
charles
brother
of

commissioned
simon
to
guard
the

wants
to
go
on

to
win
back
the
holy
land
with
the
help
of
the
tartars
pope
urban
however
is
not
interested
in
a
crusade
in
the
middle
east
but
wants
the
help
of
the
french
in
wresting
southern
italy
and
sicily
away
from
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
he
has
offered
manfred
crown
to
count
charles
but
king
louis
so
far
has
not
agreed
to
let
his
brother
make
the
attempt
so
the
two
strongest
leaders
in
christendom
are
stalemated
simon
is
desperately
determined
that
the
alliance
of
tartars
and
christians
succeed
as
he
has
confessed
to
friar
mathieu
he
bears
a
double
dishonor
the
world
despises
him
as
the
son
of
count
amalric
de
gobignon
whose
treachery
caused
the
disastrous
defeat
of
his
king
and
the
death
of
thousands
of
his
comrades
on
crusade
in
egypt
fourteen
years
earlier
but
only
simon
and
his
parents
know
that
simon
is
in
truth
the
offspring
of
an
adulterous
affair
between
his
mother
nicolette
de
gobignon
and
the
troubadour
roland
de
vency
ultimately
roland
killed
amalric
in
a
duel
and
nicolette
married
him
and
simon
though
not
amalric
son
inherited
the
title
and
the
domain
of
the
count
de
gobignon
simon
has
undertaken
the
task
of
guarding
the
tartars
as
a
way
of
restoring
the
honor
of
the
name
de
gobignon
and
proving
to
himself
his
right
to
bear
that
name
the
cause
of
the
alliance
has
met
with
many
setbacks
in
orvieto
and
simon
suspects
a
secret
enemy
is
behind
them
but
in
recent
months
the
influential
fra
tomasso
became
a
vigorous
supporter
of
the
alliance
and
sophia
cardinal
ugolini
lovely
niece
from
sicily
responded
favorably
to
simon
attentions
events
seemed
to
be
taking
a
turn
for
the
better
but
then
sordello
warned
simon
that
the
filippeschi
were
planning
to
attack
the
monaldeschi
palace
preparing
to
defend
his
hostess
the
contessa
simon
insisted
that
the
tartars
despite
their
desire
to
fight
be
kept
safe
in
the
spice
pantry
directing
the
defense
of
the
palace
from
its
tower
simon
suddenly
sensed
that
the
attack
must
be
only
a
diversion
that
the
tartars
were
the
real
target
of
whoever
was
behind
the
filippeschi
he
abruptly
left
the
tower
and
rushed
down
to
the
spice
pantry
he
had
barely
gotten
there
when
a
man
all
in
black
forced
his
way
in
and
doused
the
lights
in
darkness
the
stalker
killed
two
of
the
guards
and
almost
strangled
simon
simon
fought
off
the
killer
long
enough
to
give
friar
mathieu
time
to
open
doors

daoud
drifted
in
and
out
of
consciousness
for
two
days
after
the
fight
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
sleeping
was
much
better
than
being
awake
and
remembering
failure
in
dreams
he
rode
once
again
with
his
khushdashiya
his
brother
mamelukes
a
yellow
silk
banner
rippled
in
the
breeze
before
them
declaring
wage
war
utterly
on
the
idolators
as
they
wage
war
utterly
on
you
dust
clouds
swirled
around
them
as
they
thundered
down
upon
a
row
of
frankish
knights
from
a
distance
daoud
sent
bolt
after
bolt
from
his
compound
bow
whistling
into
the
dark
line
of
men
he
saw
men
clutch
at
their
throats
and
topple
from
the
saddle
screaming
he
charged
into
the
midst
of
the
franks
whirling
his
saif
over
his
head
his
lance
in
his
left
hand
a
knight
galloped
into
his
path
holding
up
a
shield
white
as
an
eggshell
emblazoned
with
a
red
cross
daoud
brought
the
saif
down
and
the
knight
raised
his
shield
to
fend
off
the
blow
that
left
the
crusader
momentarily
blind
and
daoud
thrust
under
the
shield
with
his
lance
the
lance
went
in
as
if
the
knight
wore
no
mail
as
the
frank
fell
backward
from
his
horse
daoud
saw
that
it
was
simon
de
gobignon
sophia
light
touch
on
his
shoulder
woke
daoud
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach
he
propped
himself
up
on
his
elbows
and
saw
the
glowing
windowpanes
and
the
familiar
white
walls
of
his
room
on
the
upper
floor
of
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
he
turned
his
head
to
look
at
sophia
her
dark
eyes
comforted
him
time
for
your
poultice
she
said
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
and
something
to
drink

dry
and

david
your
bitter
beverage
i
can
supply
but
let
me
see
to
your
wound
first
she
raised
the
blanket
that
covered
his
body
he
felt
his
skin
grow
hot
from
scalp
to
toes
she
was
gazing
upon
his
nude
body
he
was
glad
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach
rather
than
on
his
back
did
his
nakedness
mean
anything
to
her
among
christians
he
knew
men
and
women
often
saw
each
other
naked
not
only
did
women
go
through
the
streets
with
their
faces
uncovered
but
in
warm
weather
the
common
folk
men
and
women
both
walked
to
the
public
baths
with
barely
a
bit
of
cloth
wrapped
around
their
loins
and
all
christians
slept
naked
when
sophia
saw
his
body
like
this
was
it
just
another
unclothed
body
like
the
many
she
had
doubtless
seen
in
her
lifetime
did
she
feel
any
embarrassment
or
desire
as
for
himself
his
sense
of
helplessness
made
him
feel
only
embarrassed
nothing
more
he
turned
his
head
again
to
look
at
her
she
was
intent
on
administering
the
poultice
and
that
doubtless
took
her
mind
off
his
nakedness
she
had
lifted
off
the
old
cloth
stained
an
ugly
and
dropped
it
to
the
floor
he
got
a
glimpse
of
the
wound
a
red
slit
about
half
a
finger
length
with
black
knots
of
thread
in
it
in
the
back
of
his
right
leg
halfway
between
knee
and
buttock
gently
she
patted
and
stroked
on
the
wound
a
paste
made
of
ground
rose
petals
lime
water
and
egg
white
the
sufi
remedy
he
had
taught
her
to
make
lorenzo
had
used
his
knife
to
open
the
hole
made
by
the
arrow
so
that
he
would
not
tear
daoud
flesh
pulling
the
barbed
head
out
while
lorenzo
worked
over
him
daoud
drew
upon
saadi
final
teaching
to
him
to
defend
himself
against
the
pain
in
his
mind
he
began
to
create
the
drug
called
soma
he
envisioned
it
as
a
bowl
of
glowing
liquid
and
he
believed
it
could
form
a
capsule
around
any
part
of
his
body
where
there
was
pain
and
wall
it
off
from
the
rest
of
himself
at
the
same
time
filling
him
with
a
feeling
of
well
being
you
have
experienced
the
effects
of
material
drugs
on
your
body
and
learned
to
master
saadi
said
to
him
have
the
knowledge
you
need
to
create
a
drug
of
the
mind
soma
this
is
more
powerful
and
more
reliable
and
it
will
not
harm
your
body
in
any
way
indeed
soma
will
make
your
body
stronger
it
will
calm
your
mind
fill
you
with
peace
sometimes
give
you
visions
but
if
you
should
suddenly
need
all
your
faculties
they
are
yours
at
once
the
drug
is
gone
in
an
it
was
saadi
teaching
that
whatever
a
man
could
accomplish
with
drugs
he
could
accomplish
more
effectively
and
reliably
with
his
mind
alone
a
trained
man
could
envision
a
drug
that
would
serve
any
desired
purpose
and
thus
a
man
could
transcend
the
hashishiyya
reliance
on
administered
drugs
while
he
had
drunk
from
the
bowl
of
soma
and
it
had
flooded
through
his
body
daoud
fingers
had
gripped
the
little
leather
case
hung
around
his
neck
that
contained
the
sufi
tawidh
the
numerological
invocation
that
he
believed
would
speed
his
healing
a
river
of
blood
had
poured
out
of
his
leg
when
lorenzo
drew
out
the
arrow
and
he
had
fainted
sophia
had
stitched
the
wound
with
cotton
thread
that
was
now
black
with
congealed
blood
now
sophia
laid
a
clean
folded
linen
cloth
over
the
wound
used
another
strip
of
linen
to
tie
the
poultice
to
his
leg
and
then
pulled
the
blanket
up
over
him
their
eyes
had
not
met
once
during
the
time
she
was
caring
for
him
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
had
to
know
what
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
as
if
sensing
his
need
she
spoke
i
have
wanted
to
tell
you
but
you
were
too
sick
to
understand
me
the
podesta
came
here
the
night
of
the
uprising
looking
for
you
and
lorenzo
as
we
planned
i
told
him
you
had
both
gone
to
perugia
daoud
body
went
cold
he
felt
as
if
he
were
being
stalked
and
the
hunter
was
closing
in
did
he
believe
you
he
asked
she
shrugged
he
blustered
some
but
the
cardinal
ordered
him
off
in
the
end
i
think
he
must
have
hoped
to
find
you
among
the
dead
or
wounded
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
daoud
rolled
over
in
bed
the
wooden
frame
creaking
and
the
pain
tore
through
his
leg
like
the
slash
of
a
scimitar
he
groaned
through
clenched
teeth
despite
his
ability
to
shield
his
mind
from
pain
when
it
took
him
unexpectedly
like
this
it
could
hurt
like
the
torments
of
the
damned
what
are
you
doing
he
gasped
trying
to
get
up
will
be
back
and
he
must
not
see
me
wounded
he
tried
to
sit
up
and
she
laid
her
hand
firm
and
cool
on
his
forehead
and
pushed
him
back
against
the
pillows
you
are
in
more
danger
from
fever
than
you
are
from
she
said
letting
her
hand
rest
on
his
forehead
you
will
be
surprised
at
how
quickly
the
wound
heals
he
said
touching
the
tawidh
at
his
neck
as
for
fever
it
is
healthy
it
burns
out
impurities
he
laughed
bitterly
i
hope
it
is
burning
the
stupidity
out
of
me
you
stupid
she
laughed
he
did
not
join
her
it
pleased
him
a
little
in
the
midst
of
his
anguish
and
to
see
that
she
thought
well
of
him
but
she
was
wrong
about
him
and
her
life
depended
on
him
and
that
thought
made
him
feel
worse
de
gobignon
was
waiting
for
me
he
knew
i
was
coming
for
the
tartars
he
how
much
could
he
have
known
she
asked
no
one
knew
what
your
plans
were
sophia
if
de
gobignon
had
not
been
there
i
would
have
been
able
to
kill
those
two
barbarian
pigs
easily
i
did
my
best
with
all
my
skill
all
my
training
all
my
experience
and
it
went
for
nothing
that
was
a
pain
soma
would
not
shield
him
from
the
pain
of
failure
it
felt
like
a
mace
blow
to
his
chest
every
time
he
remembered
the
fight
in
the
blackness
of
the
spice
pantry
to
drive
away
the
damnable
memory
of
being
routed
by
the
christians
he
had
to
concentrate
on
the
present
and
the
future
send
someone
to
fetch
sordello
to
me
you
should
be
resting
he
laughed
and
touched
her
hand
lightly
resting
our
enemies
are
not
resting
she
sighed
but
went
when
sordello
entered
daoud
room
lorenzo
followed
him
closely
eyes
boring
into
the
back
of
the
mercenary
skull
sophia
entered
behind
lorenzo
trembling
sordello
knelt
by
daoud
bed
i
feared
for
you
messer
david
i
am
happy
to
see
you
looking
so
well
would
sordello
give
up
the
pleasures
of
hashish
and
the
promise
of
a
paradise
with
beautiful
women
what
reward
could
simon
de
gobignon
offer
him
that
could
be
more
enticing
i
have
always
known
that
this
man
was
a
sword
that
could
turn
in
my
the
monaldeschi
were
prepared
for
us
said
daoud
they
were
armed
and
on
their
battlements
when
we
came
someone
warned
them
you
do
not
suspect
me
messer
david
sordello
crouched
on
the
floor
by
daoud
bed
looked
up
slyly
sideways
at
him
i
would
be
a
fool
to
injure
one
who
has
been
so
great
a
benefactor
to
me
daoud
felt
rage
boil
up
inside
him
at
sordello
false
abjectness
he
glared
at
the
old
bravo
and
saw
a
faint
tremor
in
his
jaw
propping
himself
up
on
one
elbow
he
leaned
toward
sordello
your
fawning
insults
me
i
think
you
lie
hatred
briefly
twisted
sordello
face
then
a
knowing
smile
made
it
even
uglier
messer
david
if
i
had
told
the
count
de
gobignon
what
i
know
about
you
you
would
surely
be
dead
by
now
daoud
forced
himself
to
his
feet
the
pain
shot
through
him
like
a
lightning
bolt
but
in
his
fury
he
ignored
it
he
bent
down
and
seized
sordello
throat
with
his
right
hand
he
fell
back
sitting
on
the
bed
pulling
the
popeyed
bravo
toward
him
so
that
his
good
knee
pressed
into
the
sordello
chest
somewhere
nearby
he
heard
sophia
cry
out
in
protest
but
he
paid
no
attention
confess
that
it
was
you
and
i
will
kill
you
quickly
daoud
whispered
i
have
shown
you
paradise
and
i
can
show
you
hell
if
you
do
not
give
yourself
up
now
and
i
find
out
later
that
it
was
you
i
will
inflict
torments
of
mind
and
body
on
you
beyond
your
imagining
david
stop
you
will
kill
him
sophia
screamed
she
gripped
arm
digging
her
nails
into
his
muscle
gradually
daoud
released
his
hold
on
the
corded
throat
with
his
eyes
alone
employing
the
hashishiyya
look
that
imprisons
he
held
sordello
fast
the
bravo
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
he
was
glad
sophia
had
stopped
him
she
must
have
realized
that
he
would
regret
it
if
he
killed
sordello
in
a
fit
of
rage
if
sordello
had
not
betrayed
them
his
false
reports
to
simon
de
gobignon
would
still
be
useful
and
in
any
case
his
sudden
disappearance
immediately
after
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
palace
would
draw
de
gobignon
attention
if
it
is
not
you
then
there
is
another
among
us
who
told
simon
de
gobignon
about
my
plans
if
you
want
to
save
your
life
you
will
find
out
who
it
is
i
promise
you
messere
sordello
voice
was
a
hoarse
croak
whoever
the
escremento
is
i
will
deliver
his
life
into
your
hands
sordello
stood
up
then
turned
to
sophia
and
bowed
madonna
sordello
gasped
my
eternal
gratitude
just
get
out
sophia
snapped
was
there
a
suggestion
of
a
leer
in
sordello
lumpy
face
as
he
stared
at
sophia
but
pain
spread
from
the
wound
in
daoud
leg
in
great
ripples
through
him
and
he
lay
back
and
concentrated
on
the
sufi
exercise
that
detached
him
from
his
body
the
heavy
oak
door
closed
behind
sordello
they
were
all
three
silent
for
a
moment
then
lorenzo
jerked
the
door
open
and
looked
out
into
the
corridor
he
nodded
indicating
sordello
had
truly
gone
it
might
have
been
wiser
to
strangle
him
said
lorenzo
he
has
all
our
lives
in
his
hands
daoud
held
up
his
hand
what
he
said
was
true
he
could
have
delivered
us
to
our
enemies
before
the
attack
i
believe
he
is
still
in
my
power
when
alone
with
sophia
daoud
lay
back
on
his
cushions
she
stood
looking
down
at
him
and
he
wondered
if
that
was
pity
he
saw
in
her
face
you
are
in
such
pain
she
said
he
shook
his
head
it
is
nothing
i
do
not
mean
the
pain
of
the
body
she
understood
then
what
he
was
feeling
he
smiled
at
her
and
shut
his
eyes
she
sat
in
silence
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
while
he
lay
there
brooding
again
he
escaped
into
drowsiness
his
mind
drifted
back
to
the
sands
of
egypt
he
dreamed
again
of
riding
as
a
mameluke
when
he
woke
a
short
time
had
passed
and
sophia
was
still
sitting
there
gazing
down
at
him
hints
of
a
new
plan
began
to
come
together
in
his
mind
as
fever
purged
him
of
poison
it
had
brought
him
dreams
of
battle
not
of
intrigues
with
the
priests
and
bishops
around
the
pope
not
of
ambushes
in
narrow
streets
rather
open
war
that
was
the
meaning
of
those
dreams
perhaps
god
himself
had
sent
them
he
was
called
upon
to
wage
jihad
against
the
enemies
of
islam
as
a
mameluke
on
horseback
at
the
head
of
an
army
he
held
out
his
arm
to
sophia
help
me
up
you
and
lorenzo
and
i
must
meet
with
ugolini
later
that
morning
a
heavy
spring
rain
hammered
on
the
windows
of
ugolini
cabinet
the
storm
had
so
darkened
the
room
that
the
cardinal
servants
had
lit
extra
candles
daoud
lorenzo
and
sophia
sat
in
a
semicircle
across
from
ugolini
worktable
the
painted
glass
eyes
of
ugolini
stuffed
owl
glared
disapprovingly
down
from
the
bookshelves
at
daoud
who
had
a
sense
that
the
cardinal
felt
as
the
owl
looked
the
skull
on
the
table
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
him
he
understood
now
what
he
had
to
do
but
would
the
others
especially
ugolini
go
along
with
it
over
ugolini
frantic
protests
he
had
insisted
on
inciting
the
filippeschi
to
attack
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
that
attack
having
failed
of
its
purpose
would
the
three
of
them
still
accept
daoud
authority
ugolini
surely
would
think
that
events
had
proved
him
right
about
the
futility
of
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
how
could
he
be
won
over
to
the
idea
of
a
wider
war
war
utterly
on
the
that
he
had
decided
was
the
meaning
of
his
dream
manfred
supporters
the
ghibellini
must
take
the
pope
captive
he
said
i
know
that
you
would
prefer
peace
to
war
but
now
that
i
have
tried
to
kill
the
tartars
and
failed
we
do
not
have
that
choice
it
was
best
he
thought
to
admit
his
failure
openly
before
ugolini
threw
it
in
his
face
the
cardinal
eyes
were
almost
as
wide
and
as
stark
as
the
owl
you
would
plunge
the
whole
of
italy
into
war
no
said
daoud
but
that
is
what
is
going
to
happen
the
one
thing
that
has
kept
the
french
out
of
italy
is
the
pope
refusal
to
give
the
christian
kings
especially
the
king
of
france
permission
to
ally
themselves
with
the
tartars
but
now
that
urban
is
ill
he
may
give
king
louis
what
he
wants
when
the
pope
allows
the
alliance
louis
will
give
his
brother
charles
permission
to
attack
manfred
it
is
not
i
who
will
plunge
italy
into
war
i
am
proposing
only
that
we
act
before
the
french
do
ugolini
shook
his
head
what
do
you
mean
take
the
pope
captive
the
papal
states
are
surrounded
by
cities
ruled
by
manfred
ghibellino
supporters
the
nearest
is
siena
with
gold
and
with
timely
warnings
about
the
danger
from
the
french
we
can
persuade
siena
to
move
against
the
pope
he
held
up
his
fist
and
then
we
can
make
sure
that
the
next
pope
elected
is
favorable
to
manfred
and
through
him
well
disposed
toward
peace
with
islam
it
was
the
same
sort
of
plan
daoud
thought
as
inciting
the
filippeschi
against
the
monaldeschi
but
lorenzo
had
already
visited
siena
and
made
sure
that
the
ghibellini
of
siena
with
daoud
help
could
raise
a
far
greater
army
than
the
pope
could
muster
in
orvieto
this
time
he
would
succeed
impossible
ugolini
cried
no
king
can
control
the
papacy
the
hohenstaufen
have
been
trying
to
rule
over
the
popes
for
centuries
and
for
centuries
they
have
failed
perhaps
it
takes
a
stranger
to
see
that
where
the
hohenstaufen
failed
the
french
are
about
to
succeed
said
daoud
france
is
now
the
strongest
kingdom
in
europe
if
manfred
does
not
get
control
of
the
pope
and
the
cardinals
the
next
pope
will
be
under
the
protection
of
the
french
and
will
have
to
do
whatever
they
want
urban
is
a
sick
man
said
ugolini
there
is
not
a
cardinal
who
would
risk
a
wager
that
he
will
live
to
see
the
year
he
will
not
call
for
the
french
to
save
him
when
he
knows
the
angels
are
coming
to
get
him
no
there
i
must
disagree
with
your
eminence
said
lorenzo
lounging
in
a
large
chair
facing
ugolini
table
urban
is
a
frenchman
and
he
will
work
to
bring
the
french
into
italy
until
the
moment
the
angels
knock
at
his
door
sophia
who
had
been
sitting
quietly
in
an
armless
chair
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
said
the
pope
will
blame
the
ghibellini
for
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
he
will
want
help
and
he
will
ask
it
from
the
french
even
if
it
means
christians
joining
the
tartars
in
a
crusade
the
pope
does
not
really
want
very
shrewd
said
daoud
with
a
smile
in
her
direction
except
that
the
pope
had
decided
before
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
to
approve
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
as
we
know
from
his
persuading
fra
tomasso
to
switch
sides
it
was
because
the
pope
had
clearly
turned
against
us
that
i
planned
to
kill
the
tartars
daoud
was
tired
of
sitting
despite
the
pain
in
his
leg
he
used
his
stick
to
push
himself
to
his
feet
and
stepped
out
of
the
window
recess
he
limped
over
to
ugolini
table
we
must
send
lorenzo
to
siena
with
enough
of
our
precious
stones
to
raise
an
army
big
enough
to
overwhelm
the
papal
soldiery
and
the
orvieto
militia
it
may
take
time
to
persuade
the
sienese
to
act
it
will
take
more
time
to
muster
an
army
and
march
on
orvieto
we
must
begin
as
quickly
as
we
can
with
the
pope
in
ghibellino
hands
with
the
ghibellini
in
a
position
to
sway
the
outcome
of
the
next
papal
election
we
may
yet
keep
the
french
out
of
italy
and
that
he
thought
would
keep
crusaders
and
tartars
out
of
the
dar
ugolini
shrug
spoke
more
of
despair
than
of
acquiescence
certainly
the
french
will
come
if
we
do
nothing
you
are
right
about
that
do
as
you
will
it
is
a
miracle
we
have
survived
this
long
strange
daoud
thought
ugolini
saw
their
mere
survival
as
miraculous
to
daoud
failure
so
far
to
put
a
final
stop
to
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
made
him
wonder
whether
god
disapproved
of
him
once
he
accepted
the
fact
that
he
had
to
go
lorenzo
had
hoped
the
rain
would
continue
under
its
cover
his
leaving
the
city
was
less
likely
to
be
noticed
or
impeded
but
by
the
hour
of
none
when
he
was
packed
and
mounted
a
spare
horse
trotting
behind
him
a
bright
hot
sun
had
come
out
and
the
puddles
in
the
narrow
streets
were
turning
to
steam
at
the
porta
maggiore
he
stopped
when
he
saw
two
clerks
seated
at
tables
on
either
side
of
the
gateway
one
questioning
each
person
entering
the
town
the
other
examining
those
leaving
a
dozen
of
the
podesta
men
in
yellow
and
blue
stood
by
to
keep
people
in
line
each
clerk
consulted
what
appeared
to
be
a
list
on
a
scroll
and
on
another
scroll
wrote
down
the
names
of
those
he
questioned
only
two
days
ago
sophia
had
told
that
david
of
trebizond
and
his
man
giancarlo
were
in
perugia
now
lorenzo
thought
those
damned
clerks
were
probably
watching
for
their
return
they
could
have
been
set
at
the
gate
the
morning
after
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
palace
he
smiled
ironically
as
he
remembered
how
last
summer
he
had
sat
as
these
clerks
did
now
at
the
gateway
to
lucera
waiting
to
catch
a
certain
saracen
newly
arrived
from
egypt
now
thought
lorenzo
if
he
tried
to
leave
orvieto
he
would
not
only
be
stopped
and
possibly
arrested
he
would
be
as
good
as
telling
the
podesta
that
he
and
david
had
never
been
out
of
the
town
at
all
lorenzo
clenched
his
fists
he
felt
like
a
tuna
caught
in
a
net
if
i
stand
here
much
longer
staring
they
notice
me
and
haul
me
he
quickly
turned
his
horses
away
from
the
gate
and
headed
back
to
ugolini
mansion
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
nocturn
lorenzo
david
and
a
servant
of
ugolini
named
riccardo
whom
they
had
chosen
for
his
size
and
strength
emerged
from
an
alley
near
the
north
side
of
the
city
wall
david
wore
a
hood
pulled
low
over
his
face
he
limped
and
walked
with
a
stick
lorenzo
had
advised
against
his
being
out
in
the
street
at
all
but
david
had
answered
that
the
watch
did
not
know
he
was
in
orvieto
and
would
not
be
looking
for
him
lorenzo
was
amazed
at
how
rapidly
david
had
gotten
better
he
had
never
seen
a
man
walking
only
two
days
after
taking
a
bad
arrow
wound
in
the
leg
the
muslims
who
taught
david
the
art
of
healing
must
be
even
better
than
jewish
physicians
as
they
walked
lorenzo
made
david
recite
the
names
of
half
a
dozen
prominent
perugian
merchants
who
were
supporters
of
king
manfred
if
the
podesta
were
to
question
david
about
his
whereabouts
the
night
of
the
filippeschi
uprising
these
men
would
bear
witness
that
david
and
lorenzo
had
been
in
perugia
if
does
question
you
how
will
you
explain
that
you
are
back
in
orvieto
without
having
been
seen
entering
through
the
gate
lorenzo
asked
him
i
will
tell
him
with
the
greatest
reluctance
that
the
line
was
very
long
when
i
arrived
and
that
i
was
in
haste
to
enter
so
i
bribed
the
men
on
duty
to
let
me
by
the
more
time
passes
before
he
discovers
my
presence
in
orvieto
the
more
believable
that
will
be
if
he
suspects
you
of
anything
he
will
arrest
you
no
matter
how
good
a
story
you
tell
him
lorenzo
said
david
stopped
walking
and
rested
his
hand
on
lorenzo
shoulder
that
is
why
you
must
go
tonight
my
friend
and
come
back
quickly
with
an
army
from
siena
lorenzo
had
a
pack
over
his
shoulder
and
wore
a
long
traveling
cloak
riccardo
carried
a
coil
of
rope
ahead
of
them
was
a
small
stone
shed
built
against
the
wall
beside
one
of
the
round
guard
towers
lorenzo
was
not
particularly
frightened
by
the
ordeal
ahead
he
had
done
enough
climbing
in
his
younger
days
but
he
was
repelled
by
the
thought
that
through
the
large
opening
in
the
floor
of
the
little
house
the
people
of
this
quarter
dumped
not
only
their
garbage
but
also
the
contents
of
their
chamber
pots
they
went
quietly
to
the
door
of
the
shed
there
was
a
guard
in
the
tower
above
them
though
he
would
have
no
reason
to
watch
the
garbage
chute
riccardo
put
a
meaty
hand
on
the
door
it
gave
without
a
struggle
not
even
locked
thought
lorenzo
he
supposed
the
podesta
may
his
ballocks
wrinkle
up
like
prunes
had
not
thought
that
anyone
would
choose
this
ignominious
way
to
escape
from
the
city
sophia
told
me
to
tell
you
she
would
miss
you
david
said
kiss
her
for
me
said
lorenzo
if
david
has
bedded
sophia
riccardo
filled
the
little
room
so
that
lorenzo
felt
himself
being
crowded
to
the
edge
of
the
chute
hey
riccardo
push
me
down
you
have
the
rope
around
me
sorry
messere
the
burly
man
tied
the
rope
tightly
around
waist
just
above
the
belt
that
held
the
jewels
and
they
both
pulled
hard
on
the
knot
to
test
it
tying
the
knots
in
the
dark
they
had
to
be
doubly
careful
then
riccardo
tied
the
other
end
of
the
rope
around
his
own
waist
and
donned
heavy
oxhide
gloves
it
was
a
warm
april
night
and
lorenzo
smelled
a
horrid
odor
of
garbage
and
excrement
coming
up
from
the
pit
it
was
not
actually
a
pit
but
a
crevice
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
on
which
orvieto
was
built
lorenzo
had
hoped
the
day
heavy
rain
would
have
washed
the
cliffside
clean
but
the
people
of
orvieto
had
been
dumping
offal
here
for
centuries
your
final
instructions
he
said
to
david
ugolini
servant
guglielmo
seems
to
have
gotten
safely
out
of
the
city
with
your
horses
and
baggage
said
david
he
must
not
have
been
on
any
list
he
will
meet
you
at
the
shrine
of
saint
sebastian
on
the
road
to
siena
from
there
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
david
grasped
him
by
the
shoulders
and
then
patted
his
back
they
had
become
good
friends
lorenzo
realized
look
how
david
was
trusting
him
to
ride
with
a
fortune
in
gems
to
siena
meet
the
right
parties
bargain
with
them
deliver
the
gems
to
them
and
come
back
to
orvieto
with
a
ghibellino
army
that
was
much
to
expect
of
a
man
yet
david
seemed
not
to
doubt
that
lorenzo
would
do
it
lorenzo
felt
warm
when
he
thought
how
much
david
meant
to
him
he
had
come
on
this
mission
as
king
manfred
man
but
he
was
going
to
siena
just
as
much
for
david
as
for
manfred
bringing
the
sienese
into
the
struggle
might
keep
the
french
away
though
and
that
would
help
manfred
as
much
as
it
would
the
muslims
lower
away
then
lorenzo
said
to
riccardo
david
stepped
back
riccardo
and
lorenzo
both
took
hold
of
the
rope
lorenzo
stepped
over
the
edge
of
the
chute
his
legs
dangled
and
he
tried
not
to
think
about
how
much
empty
space
was
between
him
and
the
rocks
at
the
base
of
orvieto
mountain
the
rope
cut
painfully
into
his
waist
and
back
he
gripped
it
tightly
with
his
gloved
hands
and
wrapped
his
legs
around
it
to
take
some
of
the
strain
off
the
loop
around
his
waist
grunting
riccardo
slowly
lowered
lorenzo
through
the
chute
david
was
standing
beside
ugolini
man
and
had
laid
a
protective
hand
on
the
rope
the
hole
in
the
floor
was
just
wide
enough
for
lorenzo
shoulders
to
pass
through
then
he
was
hanging
free
below
the
city
wall
his
back
to
the
cliff
staring
out
at
a
starry
black
sky
and
the
silhouettes
of
distant
hillsides
he
felt
dizzy
and
shut
his
eyes
turn
me
he
whispered
hoarsely
up
at
the
opening
above
him
after
a
moment
he
felt
his
body
rotating
and
again
he
had
to
fight
dizziness
he
was
facing
in
toward
the
smelly
crevice
and
he
drew
up
his
legs
and
planted
his
feet
firmly
on
its
walls
with
the
help
of
the
rope
he
could
walk
down
the
cliffside
riccardo
let
out
the
rope
a
little
more
and
lorenzo
boot
sole
scraped
loudly
against
the
crumbling
tufa
surface
releasing
a
shower
of
pebbles
who
down
there
a
distant
voice
shouted
and
lorenzo
felt
as
if
someone
had
dumped
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
him
that
was
the
guard
in
the
tower
high
above
he
wondered
if
the
guard
could
see
him
down
here
he
tried
to
grip
the
sides
of
the
crevice
with
his
feet
and
pull
himself
closer
to
the
cliff
face
i
am
taking
a
piss
riccardo
called
up
to
the
guard
do
you
mind
that
place
is
not
for
pissing
the
guard
called
back
would
you
rather
i
sprinkled
your
tower
there
was
no
answer
this
time
and
riccardo
began
whistling
loudly
to
cover
any
further
noises
lorenzo
might
make
lorenzo
hoped
the
guard
would
not
come
down
to
investigate
what
if
he
did
and
riccardo
felt
he
must
let
go
of
the
rope
riccardo
must
have
had
the
same
thought
because
he
began
paying
out
the
rope
more
rapidly
and
lorenzo
feet
flew
over
the
crackling
rock
he
was
like
a
man
running
furiously
backward
it
would
be
comical
he
thought
were
he
not
in
danger
of
breaking
his
neck
this
was
a
time
when
he
wished
he
had
clung
to
a
religion
of
some
sort
rather
than
abandoning
the
faith
of
his
fathers
and
replacing
it
with
nothing
it
would
be
so
comforting
to
pray
to
an
being
who
might
be
kind
enough
to
protect
him
just
not
to
get
hurt
seemed
stupid
and
futile
he
felt
the
cliff
wall
beginning
to
slant
outward
a
bit
under
his
feet
the
whistling
from
the
shed
had
stopped
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
he
was
halfway
down
the
side
of
the
cliff
the
backs
of
his
legs
ached
from
the
strain
of
supporting
his
weight
and
his
shoulders
and
arms
hurt
too
he
began
to
worry
not
so
much
about
whether
he
would
fall
as
what
he
might
land
in
when
he
reached
the
bottom
and
the
smell
of
rot
and
filth
all
around
him
might
choke
him
before
he
ever
got
down
he
saw
directly
below
him
a
pit
of
blackness
surrounded
by
trees
that
were
only
a
little
less
dark
the
muck
might
be
over
his
head
he
might
just
sink
into
it
as
he
reached
the
level
of
the
trees
he
drew
his
knees
up
and
then
straightened
them
hard
giving
himself
a
push
away
from
the
cliff
he
was
still
being
lowered
so
that
when
he
swung
back
to
the
cliff
he
was
much
farther
down
this
time
his
boots
hit
a
coating
of
soft
stuff
on
the
rock
and
the
smell
was
unbearable
rather
break
my
neck
than
smother
in
he
kicked
again
with
his
legs
and
when
he
hit
the
end
of
the
outward
swing
the
rope
feeling
as
if
it
would
cut
him
in
two
he
grabbed
for
a
tree
branch
barely
visible
in
the
darkness
it
hit
him
in
the
stomach
and
knocked
all
the
wind
out
of
him
but
he
clung
to
it
desperately
bent
double
over
the
tree
limb
he
looked
down
and
saw
shadows
that
might
be
forest
floor
as
far
below
him
as
his
own
height
then
again
he
might
be
seeing
the
tops
of
other
trees
he
drew
his
dagger
and
cut
the
rope
around
his
middle
but
held
it
with
one
hand
he
took
deep
relieved
breaths
when
the
constraint
was
gone
he
gave
three
sharp
jerks
on
the
rope
the
signal
that
he
was
down
after
a
moment
all
tension
left
the
rope
and
he
felt
it
falling
in
the
darkness
another
moment
and
he
heard
rustlings
thumps
and
splashes
as
the
rope
landed
at
the
bottom
of
the
crevice
tomorrow
dumping
he
thought
would
quite
conceal
it
he
wondered
briefly
if
david
and
riccardo
had
safely
left
the
dumping
shed
and
were
on
their
way
back
to
ugolini
he
looked
down
again
into
the
darkness
realizing
that
if
he
jumped
from
here
he
might
fall
far
enough
to
kill
himself
having
swung
away
from
the
pile
of
offal
he
was
now
more
worried
about
breaking
his
neck
he
pulled
himself
up
straddling
the
tree
and
facing
in
toward
the
trunk
he
slid
down
to
the
trunk
then
tried
to
feel
about
with
his
foot
for
another
branch
his
feet
met
nothing
he
swung
over
the
side
of
the
branch
feeling
the
trunk
with
one
hand
and
the
space
below
him
with
his
feet
still
nothing
now
he
was
dangling
from
the
limb
holding
on
with
two
aching
hands
if
he
had
not
worn
gloves
he
would
have
no
skin
left
on
his
palms
here
goes
one
hopeful
he
let
go
he
fell
a
short
distance
feetfirst
into
a
pool
of
water
it
came
up
over
his
low
boots
soaking
his
hose
there
was
no
smell
apparently
it
was
a
pure
forest
pool
probably
a
puddle
enlarged
by
the
recent
rain
sighing
he
sloshed
out
of
it
small
creatures
hopped
and
scurried
away
from
him
could
have
been
much
much
glad
to
feel
his
feet
on
the
ground
he
hoped
the
rest
of
his
journey
to
siena
would
be
less
exciting
than
the
beginning
xlvi
friar
mathieu
sat
in
a
armchair
in
the
cloistered
garden
of
the
hospital
of
santa
clara
the
white
wisps
of
his
beard
ruffling
like
feathers
in
the
morning
breeze
the
dappled
shade
of
a
pear
tree
protected
him
from
the
june
sun
a
young
franciscan
his
tonsured
head
a
gleaming
pink
spot
surrounded
by
a
wreath
of
black
hair
stood
at
a
tall
desk
beside
friar
mathieu
writing
on
a
piece
of
parchment
all
things
lead
to
good
if
one
looks
at
them
aright
friar
mathieu
said
with
a
chuckle
that
murderer
in
black
gave
me
the
time
i
needed
to
do
something
needful
get
the
story
of
my
journey
among
the
tartars
written
before
it
is
lost
in
my
failing
memory
a
good
thing
i
did
not
land
on
my
head
despite
the
pain
he
felt
at
friar
mathieu
injuries
simon
had
to
smile
at
the
old
franciscan
little
joke
and
indeed
he
might
look
small
and
fragile
huddled
in
his
chair
but
he
was
showing
energy
and
zest
for
life
he
was
pulling
through
and
behold
friar
mathieu
went
on
lifting
his
bandaged
right
arm
i
myself
am
exempted
from
writing
friar
giuseppe
must
do
the
work
while
i
sit
here
and
explore
my
memory
and
when
i
grow
tired
of
even
that
little
bit
of
work
friar
giuseppe
reads
to
me
from
the
newly
arrived
manuscript
on
mathematics
called
computo
by
our
gifted
brother
friar
bacon
of
oxford
i
could
almost
be
grateful
to
that
assassin
simon
stood
awkwardly
looking
unhappily
down
at
him
till
friar
mathieu
motioned
him
to
sit
on
the
ground
beside
him
to
make
room
for
himself
simon
moved
a
pair
of
crutches
out
of
the
way
it
was
worrisome
that
so
soon
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
fall
that
had
almost
killed
him
friar
mathieu
had
started
hobbling
about
on
crutches
and
had
begun
dictating
sitting
painfully
upright
to
friar
giuseppe
even
though
one
leg
was
certainly
broken
and
there
were
probably
a
dozen
other
cracks
in
his
arms
and
ribs
friar
mathieu
insisted
that
he
was
more
likely
to
die
if
he
remained
in
bed
than
if
he
was
up
and
moving
about
you
are
looking
well
today
father
he
had
to
admit
it
even
though
the
old
priest
was
not
taking
proper
care
of
himself
i
am
lucky
this
happened
to
me
in
the
spring
said
friar
mathieu
the
sun
and
air
help
me
mend
but
i
fear
you
will
not
see
my
complete
recovery
since
you
will
have
to
leave
orvieto
shortly
leave
why
father
has
something
gone
wrong
his
first
thought
as
always
was
for
the
safety
of
the
tartars
ever
since
that
terrible
night
in
april
he
dreaded
leaving
them
out
of
his
sight
instead
of
answering
friar
mathieu
asked
friar
giuseppe
for
privacy
the
young
priest
bowed
deeply
and
touched
the
old
man
hand
reverently
before
gathering
up
his
writing
materials
and
turning
to
go
you
have
not
heard
then
a
courier
brought
the
news
to
the
palace
last
night
all
through
the
north
the
ghibellini
are
on
the
move
siena
it
seems
has
been
quietly
raising
an
army
to
send
against
orvieto
and
the
ghibellino
party
has
taken
power
in
pisa
and
lucca
it
appears
the
ghibellini
have
decided
to
seize
all
of
italy
before
the
french
come
in
and
take
it
we
are
thought
simon
we
have
no
ambitions
in
charles
in
this
quiet
garden
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
an
army
could
be
preparing
to
march
against
orvieto
or
even
that
the
attack
on
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
had
happened
in
the
same
city
simon
watched
a
friar
in
his
brown
robe
serenely
weeding
the
rows
of
plants
were
already
tall
and
thick
peas
haricots
lettuce
cabbage
carrots
at
gobignon
this
time
of
year
the
seedlings
would
not
be
half
as
high
will
the
sienese
besiege
orvieto
he
asked
battle
and
another
attempt
on
the
tartars
pope
urban
will
not
wait
to
see
what
they
do
said
friar
mathieu
he
feels
threatened
from
both
north
and
south
and
intends
to
move
away
from
here
as
soon
as
possible
there
is
a
rumor
that
manfred
of
sicily
himself
may
invade
the
papal
states
this
summer
simon
sprang
to
his
feet
and
threw
his
arms
wide
in
astonishment
and
what
about
the
tartars
they
will
certainly
go
where
his
holiness
goes
god
blood
simon
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
forgive
me
father
but
if
the
pope
has
not
enough
troops
to
keep
him
safe
in
orvieto
surely
he
is
in
even
more
danger
on
the
road
and
if
the
tartars
are
with
him
we
could
lose
everything
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
absently
rubbing
his
bound
right
arm
with
his
left
hand
we
can
gain
everything
his
holiness
needs
help
desperately
now
he
can
be
persuaded
to
give
king
louis
permission
to
join
with
the
tartars
the
old
franciscan
eyes
fixed
on
simon
you
must
go
to
the
pope
simon
felt
the
palms
of
his
hands
grow
cold
the
pope
will
not
listen
to
me
father
friar
mathieu
chuckled
is
he
more
likely
to
listen
to
that
fool
god
forgive
me
de
verceuil
yes
said
simon
after
a
moment
thought
de
verceuil
is
a
cardinal
and
is
it
not
his
task
to
treat
with
the
pope
mine
is
to
guard
the
ambassadors
are
you
not
close
to
king
louis
simon
almost
a
foster
son
simon
hesitated
that
is
putting
it
a
bit
strongly
but
he
knows
me
well
friar
mathieu
gestured
with
his
left
hand
then
you
are
the
person
to
carry
his
holiness
appeal
for
help
to
king
louis
the
suggestion
dismayed
simon
it
meant
he
would
have
to
leave
the
tartars
for
months
and
just
when
they
would
be
much
more
vulnerable
to
attack
following
the
pope
from
one
city
to
another
no
father
he
said
i
can
not
leave
the
tartars
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
patiently
do
you
not
see
simon
if
the
pope
does
decide
to
approve
an
alliance
with
the
tartars
john
and
philip
work
is
done
standing
on
the
gravel
walk
of
the
franciscan
cloister
garden
simon
felt
as
if
the
earth
were
shaking
under
him
he
could
not
picture
himself
speaking
to
the
pope
as
one
statesman
to
another
persuade
the
pope
suddenly
to
take
a
stand
when
he
had
vacillated
for
nearly
a
year
and
yet
he
told
himself
he
was
the
count
de
gobignon
and
the
lands
he
held
were
larger
than
some
kingdoms
but
that
only
reminded
him
that
he
held
the
title
through
a
lie
the
courtyard
before
the
papal
palace
was
crowded
with
covered
wagons
and
open
carts
horses
and
donkeys
men
carrying
crates
and
bales
here
and
there
mailed
papal
archers
in
gold
and
white
surcoats
strode
crossbows
on
their
shoulders
alert
for
pilfering
simon
asked
a
series
of
servants
for
the
pope
majordomo
and
was
directed
to
that
official
clad
in
a
glittering
embroidered
tunic
who
stood
at
the
center
of
the
papal
library
overseeing
the
packing
of
books
and
scrolls
simon
summoned
up
all
his
confidence
and
presented
himself
to
the
man
the
count
de
gobignon
of
france
the
majordomo
repeated
i
will
try
to
find
his
holiness
for
you
your
signory
they
found
pope
urban
in
a
tiny
chamber
on
the
second
floor
of
the
palace
writing
furiously
at
a
desk
that
faced
a
window
opposite
the
door
he
was
wearing
a
white
cassock
with
a
white
linen
hood
drawn
up
over
his
head
on
his
desk
simon
saw
a
jar
of
ink
a
sheaf
of
quills
and
a
stack
of
parchment
sheets
a
stand
held
a
black
earthenware
pitcher
over
a
candle
flame
holy
father
the
majordomo
began
addressing
the
pope
back
simon
watched
with
fascination
the
rapid
movements
of
pope
urban
right
arm
as
his
quill
raced
over
the
parchment
leaping
after
each
line
to
the
ink
jar
and
back
again
maledizione
the
pope
exclaimed
not
now
ludovico
god
pity
let
me
get
at
least
one
letter
done
without
you
interrupting
me
the
archangel
michael
run
you
through
if
you
speak
another
word
to
me
simon
was
momentarily
shocked
but
then
recalled
that
the
pope
was
a
shoemaker
son
once
a
bourgeois
always
a
bourgeois
he
thought
even
if
one
becomes
god
vicar
on
earth
but
by
god
robe
the
man
could
write
fast
in
a
moment
he
had
filled
a
sheet
of
parchment
with
the
short
unadorned
black
strokes
of
a
chancery
hand
simon
estimated
it
would
take
him
the
better
part
of
a
morning
to
write
that
much
of
course
pope
urban
being
a
churchman
all
his
life
had
a
good
deal
more
practice
at
writing
urban
folded
the
parchment
and
poured
melted
red
wax
from
the
black
pitcher
to
seal
it
he
took
the
large
gold
ring
from
his
finger
and
stamped
it
into
the
wax
without
looking
around
he
handed
the
letter
to
his
majordomo
to
duke
alberto
baglione
at
perugia
by
our
best
horses
said
pope
urban
have
pietro
pettorini
carry
it
he
is
our
fastest
man
holiness
said
the
majordomo
diffidently
taking
the
letter
the
count
de
gobignon
wishes
to
see
you
ah
urban
half
turned
in
his
chair
to
look
at
simon
simon
saw
that
the
pope
wrinkled
face
was
a
deep
pink
and
his
eyes
glittered
loose
strands
of
gray
hair
escaping
from
under
his
hood
quivered
as
his
head
shook
with
a
slight
constant
tremor
simon
had
heard
that
men
sometimes
rallied
in
the
final
stages
of
an
illness
before
the
slide
into
darkness
that
perhaps
accounted
for
the
pope
color
and
energy
simon
heart
ached
for
the
old
man
this
was
the
spiritual
father
of
the
world
and
his
troubles
troubles
simon
had
in
part
brought
to
him
were
aiding
whatever
disease
was
destroying
him
simon
de
gobignon
urban
cried
raising
bony
hands
in
benediction
if
you
had
not
come
to
me
i
should
have
sent
for
you
his
pale
blue
eyes
shifted
from
side
to
side
and
simon
felt
even
more
pain
for
him
man
should
not
think
of
traveling
it
will
kill
urban
half
stood
and
his
majordomo
rushed
past
simon
to
turn
his
chair
so
that
the
pope
could
face
his
visitor
he
was
sitting
in
a
simple
chair
without
arms
simon
stepped
into
the
room
and
dropped
to
one
knee
the
pope
extended
his
trembling
right
hand
and
simon
kissed
his
gold
fisherman
ring
on
its
circular
face
was
an
engraving
of
a
bearded
man
whom
simon
guessed
must
be
saint
peter
casting
a
net
from
the
stern
of
a
boat
seen
close
at
hand
and
without
the
tall
tiara
and
the
crozier
and
the
heavy
robes
of
office
urban
was
very
short
simon
wondered
whether
he
had
always
been
a
little
man
or
whether
age
and
the
strains
of
his
office
had
shrunk
him
stand
up
monseigneur
le
comte
vous
plaît
said
the
pope
changing
to
french
i
am
sorry
there
is
no
chair
but
this
is
where
i
do
all
my
real
work
and
it
is
best
not
to
encourage
visitors
to
sit
ludovico
leave
us
and
shut
the
door
behind
you
and
do
not
hang
about
in
the
corridor
eavesdropping
simon
rose
and
found
himself
looking
down
at
the
skullcap
on
top
of
the
pope
head
feeling
awkward
he
took
a
few
steps
backward
until
his
back
was
against
the
door
of
the
tiny
chamber
urban
said
i
have
long
wanted
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
what
happened
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
simon
gave
the
pope
a
detailed
account
of
the
battle
he
ended
with
his
fight
with
the
man
in
black
urban
eyes
widened
and
the
trembling
of
his
head
grew
more
pronounced
when
simon
told
how
the
enemy
had
escaped
throwing
friar
mathieu
from
the
cellar
stairs
the
pope
winced
in
pain
so
urban
mused
this
murderer
doubtless
sent
by
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
still
lurks
somewhere
in
orvieto
we
have
tried
to
track
him
down
said
simon
but
the
filippeschi
deny
any
knowledge
of
him
and
the
podesta
it
seems
has
not
the
power
to
make
them
answer
our
questions
he
allowed
the
contempt
he
felt
for
to
creep
into
his
voice
open
the
door
and
see
if
that
sneaking
ludovico
is
listening
outside
pope
urban
said
his
lips
twitched
under
his
flowing
gray
beard
in
what
was
probably
a
smile
simon
went
to
the
door
and
saw
no
one
in
the
corridor
but
a
helmeted
standing
about
ten
paces
away
servants
with
a
huge
bed
frame
struggled
past
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
again
to
the
pope
yes
said
urban
what
was
i
saying
ah
yes
simon
i
expect
to
be
in
my
grave
before
the
year
is
out
god
forbid
your
holiness
god
do
me
that
kindness
you
mean
urban
raised
a
deprecating
hand
i
am
worn
out
i
am
ready
to
go
home
but
i
have
a
last
task
to
do
before
i
die
i
must
insure
the
destruction
of
the
odious
manfred
i
must
not
let
him
kill
me
before
my
work
is
done
and
i
must
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
ghibellini
so
though
it
will
shorten
my
life
even
more
i
must
leave
orvieto
now
that
the
ghibellini
have
stirred
up
the
filippeschi
to
make
civil
war
i
am
no
longer
safe
on
this
mountaintop
perugia
is
more
secure
it
has
a
big
army
and
it
is
surrounded
by
a
strong
ring
of
other
guelfo
cities
and
castles
after
i
am
gone
the
cardinals
will
be
safe
there
while
they
elect
a
new
pope
simon
realized
that
he
was
indeed
looking
at
a
dying
man
from
here
to
perugia
was
a
journey
of
at
least
two
weeks
through
difficult
mountainous
country
urban
might
get
there
safely
but
he
would
not
live
there
long
the
election
of
a
new
pope
would
take
months
it
had
been
known
to
take
years
and
urban
successor
might
be
even
more
reluctant
to
join
forces
with
the
tartars
than
urban
had
been
what
if
it
were
cardinal
ugolini
he
was
as
eligible
as
anyone
or
someone
under
his
influence
the
little
they
had
accomplished
so
far
might
be
wholly
undone
time
time
was
the
most
terrible
enemy
of
all
the
more
time
passed
the
less
likely
that
the
alliance
would
be
formed
the
joint
attack
on
the
saracens
launched
simon
saw
time
as
a
black
river
in
flood
sweeping
away
everything
he
had
worked
and
fought
for
must
prevail
upon
him
to
give
his
permission
now
but
how
can
i
sway
a
man
three
times
my
age
the
pope
himself
the
only
way
to
keep
from
giving
in
to
despair
was
to
plunge
in
as
if
this
were
a
tournament
or
a
fight
to
the
death
simon
plunged
in
your
holiness
before
you
leave
orvieto
i
beg
you
to
recognize
that
we
must
join
with
the
tartars
to
crush
the
infidel
urban
sighed
you
think
just
as
your
king
louis
does
he
held
up
an
admonitory
finger
europe
first
simon
the
church
must
be
strong
in
europe
before
our
princes
go
adventuring
in
outremer
but
it
was
the
popes
who
preached
the
crusades
in
the
first
place
simon
answered
baffled
urban
eyes
grew
wide
and
he
leaned
forward
and
i
will
preach
yet
another
crusade
simon
against
manfred
the
antichrist
that
is
why
i
would
have
sent
for
you
if
you
had
not
come
here
you
must
make
the
journey
to
king
louis
and
tell
him
that
this
crusade
that
i
will
preach
is
the
most
important
war
of
his
lifetime
he
must
come
to
my
aid
i
will
make
his
brother
charles
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
i
will
write
the
letter
to
king
louis
and
you
will
carry
it
to
him
i
must
make
my
he
will
heed
your
appeal
if
you
give
him
what
he
wants
your
holiness
write
that
letter
but
in
it
give
your
permission
for
king
louis
to
ally
himself
with
the
tartars
and
begin
preparations
for
a
new
crusade
urban
looked
slyly
up
at
simon
surely
you
suspect
that
it
was
i
who
persuaded
fra
tomasso
to
change
his
colors
where
the
tartars
are
concerned
i
saw
to
it
that
the
possibility
of
an
alliance
was
kept
alive
so
that
i
might
have
something
louis
and
i
could
haggle
over
louis
is
the
most
stubborn
man
in
the
world
if
i
simply
give
him
whatever
he
wants
there
is
no
guarantee
that
he
will
give
me
what
i
want
simon
took
a
deep
breath
what
he
was
about
to
say
might
offend
the
pope
deeply
your
holiness
you
have
said
it
yourself
there
is
no
more
time
for
haggling
you
must
make
your
best
offer
and
hope
it
is
enough
the
pope
shut
his
eyes
and
slumped
in
his
chair
simon
heart
went
cold
thinking
for
a
moment
that
the
old
man
had
suffered
a
seizure
but
then
urban
said
very
softly
help
me
to
turn
my
chair
around
now
simon
heart
beat
faster
as
he
moved
the
pope
chair
so
that
it
faced
his
desk
urban
took
a
gleaming
blank
sheet
of
parchment
from
the
pile
on
his
desk
dipped
a
quill
shook
it
and
began
to
write
simon
stood
by
the
wall
his
heart
pounding
with
exhilaration
could
it
actually
be
that
his
words
had
moved
the
pope
himself
it
seemed
impossible
as
if
he
had
stood
in
the
path
of
a
mighty
river
and
diverted
its
course
the
tartars
the
old
man
said
with
a
sigh
sometime
later
when
he
had
covered
two
sheets
of
parchment
i
hope
i
am
not
making
a
terrible
mistake
i
still
think
fra
tomasso
was
right
in
what
he
first
said
about
them
he
dropped
wax
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
stamped
it
with
his
ring
and
blew
on
the
wax
to
cool
it
then
he
folded
the
parchment
and
sealed
it
again
ride
to
king
louis
as
quickly
as
possible
urban
turned
again
half
rising
from
his
chair
and
handed
simon
the
letter
shall
i
carry
the
king
answer
to
perugia
holy
father
urban
shrugged
oh
yes
i
shall
surely
be
in
perugia
by
the
time
you
come
back
but
god
will
take
me
before
the
first
of
charles
knights
sets
foot
in
italy
he
raised
a
pale
hand
to
silence
polite
protest
and
there
was
actually
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
whatever
my
successor
thinks
he
will
have
a
hard
time
undoing
the
decisions
i
have
made
today
by
the
time
the
next
pope
is
elected
he
will
have
a
french
army
to
help
him
destroy
the
hohenstaufen
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
what
of
the
tartar
ambassadors
your
holiness
simon
asked
thinking
that
it
would
be
best
to
hasten
those
negotiations
too
lest
the
next
pope
disapprove
of
them
should
i
take
them
with
me
to
the
king
no
said
urban
firmly
then
you
would
have
to
take
a
troop
with
you
to
guard
them
you
may
have
to
travel
far
to
find
king
louis
he
is
setting
out
on
a
royal
progress
through
his
kingdom
i
had
a
report
of
him
just
two
days
ago
that
is
one
great
benefit
of
this
office
his
gray
beard
twitched
again
and
simon
knew
that
he
was
smiling
news
comes
to
us
from
everywhere
then
his
eyelids
lowered
that
is
also
what
makes
being
the
holy
father
so
wearisome
yes
of
course
king
louis
made
a
journey
of
inspection
through
some
portion
of
his
realm
nearly
every
summer
it
might
be
months
simon
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
before
he
could
find
the
king
deliver
the
pope
letter
and
get
back
to
the
papal
court
so
much
could
happen
the
most
important
thing
of
all
has
already
happened
we
have
won
we
have
the
alliance
triumph
rang
like
cathedral
bells
in
his
ears
he
was
bringing
victory
to
the
king
and
to
count
charles
and
his
success
would
restore
honor
to
the
house
of
gobignon
simon
knelt
once
again
kissing
the
fisherman
ring
and
thinking
that
the
hand
that
wore
it
would
soon
be
cold
but
as
he
hurried
down
a
corridor
in
the
palazzo
papale
already
planning
his
route
to
france
the
bells
of
triumph
stopped
ringing
and
in
the
silence
a
face
appeared
before
his
mind
eye
amber
eyes
olive
skin
and
lips
by
all
the
angels
and
saints
i
may
never
see
her
again
for
a
moment
he
felt
torn
duty
and
honor
demanded
that
he
leave
orvieto
at
once
but
what
of
love
sophia
image
smiled
and
he
decided
he
would
need
at
least
a
day
to
prepare
for
his
journey
anyway
before
he
left
orvieto
he
must
see
sophia
and
make
sure
that
the
meeting
would
not
be
their
last
xlvii
fat
gray
clouds
hung
low
over
the
umbrian
hills
and
sophia
thought
she
heard
thunder
rumbling
in
the
west
as
simon
message
had
promised
he
was
waiting
for
her
by
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
on
the
road
leading
north
from
orvieto
but
what
was
he
doing
here
she
wondered
with
spare
horses
and
a
loaded
baggage
mule
he
waved
to
her
and
dismounted
and
his
scudiero
the
same
man
who
had
yesterday
delivered
simon
note
to
her
took
charge
of
the
beasts
clearly
simon
was
beginning
a
journey
he
had
not
simply
come
out
here
to
meet
her
but
he
would
not
go
anywhere
far
with
no
more
company
than
one
squire
and
how
could
he
leave
the
tartars
when
hardly
two
months
ago
he
had
nearly
lost
his
life
protecting
them
trying
to
puzzle
out
what
was
afoot
she
rode
with
ugolini
man
riccardo
beside
her
to
the
shrine
where
a
mary
held
a
smiling
baby
jesus
riccardo
helped
her
down
from
her
horse
and
simon
came
forward
she
took
simon
arm
and
he
led
her
into
the
pine
forest
beside
the
road
she
studied
his
face
trying
to
guess
what
thoughts
were
passing
behind
his
somber
blue
eyes
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
of
their
companions
she
asked
him
are
you
going
to
perugia
ahead
of
the
pope
he
did
not
answer
her
at
once
so
she
kept
her
gaze
on
him
sophia
enjoyed
looking
at
simon
as
she
enjoyed
looking
at
beautiful
icons
jewels
sculptures
yet
his
body
did
not
have
the
fine
proportions
she
had
seen
in
statues
made
by
greeks
of
old
he
was
very
tall
and
slender
all
sharp
lines
pointing
to
heaven
his
head
framed
by
long
dark
brown
hair
was
narrow
the
nose
and
chin
angular
his
eyes
set
in
deep
hollows
were
bright
with
candor
and
intelligence
though
at
times
she
saw
in
them
a
haunted
look
she
even
found
his
barbaric
frankish
garb
pleasing
from
simon
narrow
shoulders
hung
a
cloak
of
rich
crimson
silk
and
he
wore
a
soft
maroon
cap
adorned
with
a
feather
the
purple
surcoat
that
extended
below
his
knees
sparkled
with
dozens
of
embroidered
repetitions
of
a
design
of
three
gold
crowns
in
constantinople
only
the
basileus
and
his
consort
were
permitted
to
wear
purple
from
simon
black
leather
belt
decorated
with
silver
plates
hung
a
curving
saracen
sword
precious
stones
twinkled
in
its
handle
now
that
she
considered
it
she
recalled
that
she
had
always
seen
simon
in
more
subdued
colors
dressed
this
way
to
please
she
thought
fondly
he
looked
away
from
her
but
there
was
nowhere
for
him
to
look
they
were
walled
in
on
all
sides
by
a
thick
growth
of
pines
the
lower
trunks
of
the
trees
were
straight
and
clean
like
the
poles
of
a
palisade
their
branches
which
started
higher
than
she
could
reach
putting
out
the
bright
green
needles
of
new
summer
growth
somewhere
far
above
them
was
the
cloudy
sky
but
here
they
were
enveloped
in
deep
shadow
under
interlocked
pine
branches
the
forest
was
so
dark
and
soundless
that
she
began
to
feel
a
little
frightened
simon
and
she
were
enemies
after
all
even
though
she
hoped
he
would
never
realize
it
she
often
forgot
it
herself
when
she
was
with
him
liking
him
as
much
as
she
did
i
am
not
going
to
perugia
he
said
did
you
have
me
ride
all
the
way
out
here
to
tell
me
no
more
than
that
she
demanded
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
he
said
hoarsely
he
turned
toward
her
and
his
face
glowed
with
adoration
the
boy
the
dear
beautiful
boy
he
loves
me
and
he
means
it
with
every
fiber
of
his
she
felt
a
wave
of
warmth
not
love
but
surely
a
kindliness
going
out
from
her
to
him
he
turned
and
took
her
shoulders
in
his
big
hands
she
liked
the
feel
of
his
hands
on
her
if
only
she
could
forget
about
david
she
could
happily
give
herself
to
him
but
she
acting
for
david
and
she
was
here
to
find
out
what
this
frank
was
planning
she
must
make
some
guesses
and
then
see
if
she
could
get
him
to
confirm
them
such
as
where
was
he
going
and
why
was
he
leaving
the
tartars
behind
she
had
to
tilt
her
head
back
to
look
into
his
troubled
face
come
let
us
sit
down
she
said
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
to
a
tree
whose
trunk
was
wide
enough
to
let
them
rest
their
backs
against
it
her
silk
skirt
formed
a
dark
green
semicircle
around
her
bordered
by
an
embroidered
orange
and
red
design
of
flowers
there
was
a
grace
in
the
way
he
sat
down
despite
his
long
arms
and
legs
with
a
practiced
movement
he
swept
his
sword
back
behind
him
out
of
his
way
where
were
david
of
trebizond
and
giancarlo
the
night
of
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
palace
he
asked
suddenly
she
went
cold
did
he
suspect
them
and
her
too
had
told
him
of
his
unsuccessful
effort
to
see
david
and
lorenzo
that
very
night
they
had
both
left
the
city
she
said
they
went
to
perugia
and
assisi
david
wished
to
see
the
body
of
san
francesco
at
assisi
i
thought
he
was
interested
in
silk
not
saints
simon
glowered
at
her
she
made
herself
laugh
surely
you
do
not
think
david
the
merchant
was
in
the
streets
fighting
the
night
the
monaldeschi
were
attacked
she
heard
a
bell
ring
somewhere
in
the
distance
some
little
hillside
church
ringing
out
the
hour
of
tierce
the
chiming
sounded
clear
and
peaceful
god
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
have
become
a
simon
sighed
and
took
her
hand
gently
and
held
it
resting
on
his
thigh
why
does
it
have
to
be
cardinal
ugolini
who
is
your
uncle
if
not
for
my
uncle
adelberto
i
would
not
be
here
and
we
would
never
have
met
she
said
you
are
so
beautiful
he
said
the
adoration
in
his
eyes
was
like
a
dagger
in
her
heart
she
wanted
so
much
for
it
to
be
for
her
and
it
was
for
a
woman
who
did
not
exist
am
so
far
from
what
he
thinks
i
am
michael
and
manfred
treated
me
like
a
whore
david
sends
me
to
seduce
this
man
who
is
his
and
that
she
thought
was
why
she
so
much
hated
to
see
what
had
happened
to
rachel
and
to
know
that
david
had
done
it
and
that
she
herself
had
a
hand
in
it
you
will
never
come
back
to
orvieto
will
you
she
said
disconsolately
his
grip
on
her
hand
tightened
no
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
meet
you
today
tell
me
if
your
uncle
goes
to
perugia
to
follow
the
pope
will
you
go
with
him
she
let
her
body
lean
sideways
till
she
was
pressed
against
him
oh
i
am
sure
my
uncle
will
go
he
is
the
cardinal
camerlengo
after
all
as
for
me
i
would
go
if
i
thought
i
would
see
you
there
his
head
drew
down
toward
hers
do
you
care
for
me
that
much
i
have
never
known
love
like
this
simon
my
husband
was
kind
to
me
and
i
was
sorry
when
he
died
but
the
way
i
feel
about
you
is
different
i
think
i
will
die
if
i
do
not
know
when
i
can
see
you
again
joy
lit
up
his
thin
face
and
she
despised
herself
i
will
find
you
sophia
i
will
be
gone
for
months
but
i
will
ride
like
the
wind
and
when
i
come
back
it
will
be
to
perugia
must
be
going
to
france
he
was
traveling
with
but
one
man
so
as
to
go
faster
the
tartars
had
nearly
been
killed
in
the
filippeschi
uprising
but
he
would
be
leaving
them
for
only
one
thing
could
be
more
important
to
simon
than
the
lives
of
the
two
tartars
and
that
was
what
the
tartars
represented
the
pope
must
be
offering
to
approve
the
alliance
simon
must
be
carrying
the
message
i
tell
david
about
this
he
will
ride
after
simon
and
kill
her
thoughts
began
to
race
even
if
simon
were
stopped
was
it
not
still
too
late
to
keep
the
franks
and
the
tartars
from
joining
forces
no
probably
not
because
the
pope
was
dying
if
this
alliance
were
not
settled
now
the
talking
and
deciding
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
with
a
new
pope
could
she
seduce
simon
into
abandoning
his
mission
altogether
running
off
with
her
no
he
would
never
betray
so
great
a
trust
not
even
for
love
of
her
i
swear
to
you
i
will
find
you
i
will
see
you
again
sophia
he
was
saying
believe
me
will
not
live
long
i
do
believe
you
simon
her
loathing
for
herself
grew
stronger
now
his
arms
were
around
her
and
he
was
pressing
her
back
away
from
the
tree
trunk
and
down
onto
the
soft
bed
of
pine
needles
his
open
mouth
was
against
hers
his
lips
devouring
hers
his
hands
caressed
her
shoulders
and
her
back
moving
ceaselessly
one
hand
slid
around
and
held
her
breast
and
she
heard
his
little
indrawn
breath
of
pleasure
it
must
feel
good
to
him
she
thought
it
felt
good
to
be
touched
there
and
she
pushed
back
against
his
hand
she
felt
her
body
relax
and
grow
warm
it
had
been
so
long
nearly
a
year
since
a
man
had
held
her
in
his
arms
need
this
as
much
as
any
man
does
men
can
go
to
whores
but
where
can
i
go
she
loved
the
feel
of
his
strong
arms
around
her
as
she
lay
beside
him
he
moved
so
that
his
whole
length
was
pressed
against
her
and
now
he
did
not
seem
any
taller
than
she
was
she
felt
the
hardness
at
his
groin
that
he
pressed
against
her
leg
and
she
felt
an
answering
heat
within
herself
can
not
let
this
man
make
love
to
me
and
then
send
david
after
him
to
kill
him
i
can
not
i
can
not
i
would
hate
myself
she
felt
her
body
opening
to
him
felt
her
need
of
him
if
they
came
together
now
it
would
be
love
not
the
love
she
felt
for
david
but
love
even
so
and
if
she
condemned
him
to
death
then
she
would
destroy
herself
but
if
she
did
not
tell
david
where
simon
was
going
she
would
betray
him
and
bring
ruin
down
on
his
people
and
her
own
if
she
let
simon
make
love
to
her
she
would
be
so
torn
that
afterward
she
would
probably
go
mad
he
was
already
partly
on
top
of
her
and
she
wriggled
away
from
him
pushing
at
him
stop
it
there
was
a
power
in
her
voice
that
she
had
not
intended
to
unleash
she
was
no
longer
cardinal
ugolini
sweet
little
niece
sophia
orfali
from
sicily
but
sophia
karaiannides
the
woman
of
byzantium
a
hand
width
of
space
separated
their
faces
her
voice
seemed
to
freeze
him
he
stared
at
her
as
if
he
were
seeing
a
stranger
then
anger
blazed
up
in
his
eyes
his
arms
tightened
those
arms
seemed
so
lean
but
the
strength
in
them
was
like
steel
chains
drawn
tight
she
clenched
her
fists
and
locked
her
bent
arms
in
front
of
her
to
keep
him
away
his
lips
drew
back
from
his
teeth
and
she
felt
his
hot
breath
on
her
face
barbarian
she
thought
where
only
a
moment
ago
she
had
wanted
him
now
she
hated
him
he
was
just
like
all
those
savages
who
had
destroyed
constantinople
stolen
raped
murdered
her
parents
yes
and
she
had
helped
the
basileus
michael
to
drive
them
out
and
she
would
kill
this
one
too
never
would
a
union
of
frankish
and
tartar
barbarians
threaten
her
people
by
this
one
man
death
she
could
guarantee
that
with
all
the
strength
her
anger
gave
her
she
straightened
her
arms
pushing
him
away
her
right
arm
free
she
thrust
her
open
palm
against
his
jaw
forcing
his
head
back
let
me
go
and
again
it
was
the
powerful
voice
of
sophia
karaiannides
god
blood
his
eyes
were
wide
and
there
was
amazement
in
them
no
longer
anger
he
released
her
so
suddenly
she
fell
back
hard
against
the
floor
of
the
forest
immediately
he
reached
for
her
but
his
hands
were
gentle
once
more
helping
her
to
sit
up
he
knelt
before
her
please
forgive
me
he
sounded
on
the
verge
of
tears
please
i
lost
command
of
myself
standing
up
she
brushed
pine
needles
from
the
back
of
her
skirt
and
her
shawl
he
moved
to
help
her
and
she
pulled
away
sophia
i
have
never
loved
any
woman
as
much
as
i
love
you
nonsense
simon
you
have
far
to
ride
he
moved
around
so
that
he
was
facing
her
his
usually
pale
face
flushed
his
chest
heaving
marry
me
sophia
if
he
had
struck
her
she
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
but
she
quickly
recovered
herself
he
thought
he
could
have
his
way
with
her
by
offering
marriage
simon
i
am
not
a
woman
whose
legs
can
be
parted
by
a
promise
of
marriage
the
note
she
heard
in
her
voice
distressed
her
she
was
being
too
much
her
true
worldly
self
with
him
if
he
were
not
deaf
to
everything
but
his
own
passion
he
would
hear
it
and
he
would
suspect
that
she
was
not
what
she
seemed
to
be
she
reminded
herself
must
seem
to
be
awed
that
this
great
nobleman
speaks
to
me
of
you
put
it
crudely
he
said
his
eyes
narrowed
with
warmth
to
shock
me
i
suppose
but
you
defend
your
honor
and
you
speak
plainly
i
speak
plainly
too
i
love
you
the
sight
of
him
standing
there
gazing
at
her
with
such
yearning
in
his
eyes
was
too
painful
she
kept
thinking
of
herself
telling
david
what
she
had
learned
today
she
kept
seeing
this
tall
handsome
man
lying
dead
in
a
ditch
she
had
to
get
away
from
him
the
morning
is
well
along
she
said
you
had
better
get
started
if
you
want
to
cover
much
distance
by
nightfall
where
do
you
plan
to
spend
this
night
she
despised
herself
because
she
had
asked
the
question
to
make
it
easier
for
david
to
trail
him
he
frowned
at
her
sophia
i
must
have
your
answer
i
mean
what
i
say
i
love
you
i
want
to
marry
you
holy
virgin
would
the
fellow
never
give
in
did
he
really
think
her
foolish
enough
to
believe
he
was
sincerely
proposing
to
her
yes
perhaps
he
did
think
that
of
the
sophia
she
pretended
to
be
she
must
answer
him
as
that
girl
would
she
cast
her
eyes
down
her
hands
clasped
before
her
simon
do
not
torment
me
i
know
that
you
can
not
marry
me
my
uncle
has
told
me
who
you
are
your
ancient
noble
house
your
vast
holdings
perhaps
you
mean
to
be
kind
to
me
by
speaking
of
marriage
but
a
man
of
your
rank
has
too
many
obligations
you
can
not
marry
as
you
choose
so
please
speak
of
it
no
more
what
if
we
could
get
married
the
thought
arose
unbidden
in
her
mind
as
she
stared
down
at
the
brown
pine
needles
she
wanted
to
drive
it
out
again
but
could
not
stop
herself
from
seeing
what
it
might
be
like
marriage
a
home
a
fixed
secure
abode
where
she
might
live
out
her
life
in
serene
peaceful
occupations
raising
children
spinning
embroidering
managing
a
household
what
so
many
women
rich
and
poor
had
what
she
had
not
known
since
she
was
a
young
girl
a
a
and
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
like
simon
kind
brave
handsome
well
spoken
she
understood
suddenly
why
it
was
always
so
easy
for
her
to
forget
sophia
karaiannides
and
become
sophia
orfali
she
did
what
was
given
her
to
do
but
in
the
core
of
her
heart
what
she
longed
for
was
to
be
someone
like
sophia
orfali
who
truly
had
a
place
in
the
world
sophia
orfali
for
all
that
she
was
a
mask
was
more
real
than
sophia
karaiannides
it
was
too
painful
for
her
the
unexpected
longing
for
the
love
she
could
never
have
the
grief
for
simon
whom
she
was
going
to
murder
let
us
get
back
you
to
your
scudiero
and
i
to
my
escort
she
said
she
started
walking
toward
the
road
he
stepped
in
front
of
her
sophia
wait
she
felt
something
in
her
chest
like
a
ball
of
iron
she
had
her
tears
well
under
control
for
the
moment
but
she
had
to
get
away
from
him
otherwise
she
would
not
be
able
to
stop
herself
from
crying
please
he
said
again
she
felt
herself
forced
to
look
up
at
him
his
thin
face
so
grave
so
intelligent
i
beg
you
to
believe
me
i
do
want
you
desperately
love
is
of
the
spirit
and
it
is
of
the
body
too
but
i
am
not
proposing
marriage
just
to
possess
you
i
want
to
marry
you
because
i
love
you
she
stood
looking
at
this
handsome
young
man
and
breathing
the
fragrance
of
air
and
she
thought
of
david
what
she
felt
for
david
drew
no
line
between
body
and
spirit
if
she
had
all
the
things
she
had
just
been
longing
for
a
husband
a
family
a
home
and
david
appeared
out
of
nowhere
and
looked
at
her
with
those
glowing
eyes
of
his
and
told
her
to
come
with
him
she
would
abandon
everything
for
him
when
she
looked
at
david
she
saw
a
pillar
of
pure
fire
burning
inside
him
there
was
a
power
in
him
that
called
out
to
everything
that
was
strong
in
her
and
demanded
that
she
accept
no
other
man
for
her
mate
you
think
that
my
title
my
family
is
an
obstacle
to
our
marrying
simon
said
but
it
is
not
if
you
knew
who
i
really
am
you
might
not
want
to
marry
she
laughed
a
little
at
the
thought
of
him
not
being
who
he
so
obviously
was
are
you
some
peasant
lad
who
stole
the
place
of
the
true
simon
de
gobignon
then
it
is
something
like
that
in
god
name
simon
what
are
you
talking
about
his
nostrils
flared
he
drew
air
in
a
great
gulp
through
his
mouth
he
took
a
step
toward
her
and
she
tensed
lest
he
seize
her
again
but
he
kept
his
hands
at
his
sides
the
last
count
de
gobignon
was
a
traitor
to
his
king
to
his
countrymen
to
his
own
vassals
he
betrayed
a
whole
army
of
crusaders
into
the
hands
of
the
saracens
he
died
in
disgrace
his
grave
is
unmarked
so
foul
was
his
treachery
that
no
man
of
good
family
in
france
will
permit
his
daughter
to
marry
me
sophia
found
that
hard
to
believe
there
must
be
many
great
barons
in
france
who
would
forget
the
crime
of
the
father
no
matter
how
horrible
when
the
son
was
so
attractive
and
especially
so
rich
simon
you
have
so
much
to
offer
a
wife
she
would
have
laughed
at
the
absurdity
of
all
this
but
the
tortured
expression
clearly
mirrored
a
tortured
soul
oh
surely
there
are
barons
who
would
sell
their
daughters
to
the
devil
for
a
bit
of
land
he
agreed
i
meant
that
i
could
not
marry
the
women
i
chose
but
there
is
worse
sophia
i
could
lose
everything
if
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
were
known
but
that
is
the
least
of
it
it
puts
my
life
in
your
hands
and
the
lives
of
my
mother
and
my
father
life
is
already
in
my
she
thought
her
eyes
hurting
from
looking
so
intensely
into
his
but
then
the
full
meaning
of
what
he
had
said
bore
in
on
her
father
simon
are
you
telling
me
that
you
are
not
i
am
not
the
son
of
the
count
de
gobignon
my
father
was
a
troubadour
the
sire
roland
de
vency
with
whom
my
mother
fell
in
love
while
amalric
de
gobignon
was
still
alive
she
succeeded
in
passing
me
off
as
the
count
son
but
we
three
my
mother
roland
and
i
know
the
secret
and
my
confessor
and
now
you
she
shook
her
head
bewildered
she
felt
no
doubt
that
what
he
was
telling
her
was
true
the
pain
in
his
face
was
like
that
of
a
man
who
had
stripped
his
very
skin
off
to
reveal
himself
to
her
it
tore
at
her
heart
to
see
him
suffering
so
much
but
how
could
this
happen
simon
it
is
too
long
a
tale
for
today
perhaps
one
day
i
can
tell
you
all
of
it
but
do
you
believe
me
now
truly
there
is
no
barrier
of
family
between
you
and
me
sophia
unless
you
set
one
there
knowing
that
i
am
i
am
a
bastard
and
an
impostor
could
you
think
of
marrying
me
the
tears
she
had
been
holding
back
for
an
hour
it
seemed
burst
suddenly
from
her
eyes
as
sobs
welled
up
in
her
throat
and
yet
she
wanted
to
laugh
as
well
at
the
irony
of
it
to
think
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
pretense
if
he
had
any
idea
of
pretense
and
david
he
would
probably
kill
her
on
the
spot
his
face
coming
nearer
and
nearer
all
his
finery
was
a
red
and
purple
blur
before
her
eyes
his
hands
were
reaching
for
her
loves
me
he
really
loves
me
he
really
does
want
to
marry
if
he
had
taken
that
strange
saracen
sword
of
his
out
and
run
her
through
with
it
he
could
not
have
hurt
her
more
she
had
been
thinking
about
sending
david
to
kill
him
and
he
had
just
entrusted
all
of
himself
his
family
everything
he
possessed
his
body
and
his
soul
to
her
if
david
went
after
him
this
time
one
of
them
simon
or
david
would
surely
die
the
luck
of
the
monaldeschi
palace
encounter
could
not
protect
both
a
second
time
she
felt
simon
hands
on
her
shoulders
she
pulled
away
from
him
sophia
she
heard
the
anguish
in
his
voice
tartars
and
muslims
were
a
thousand
leagues
away
if
christians
and
tartars
were
destined
to
join
forces
and
destroy
islam
it
would
happen
she
willed
herself
to
believe
that
and
if
it
was
not
destined
it
would
not
happen
david
and
simon
were
here
to
say
anything
to
david
about
mission
to
france
was
to
doom
one
man
perhaps
both
it
might
be
the
man
who
loved
her
or
it
might
be
the
man
she
loved
and
she
did
not
want
either
to
die
sophia
i
beg
you
speak
to
me
are
you
turning
against
me
she
wiped
her
streaming
eyes
to
see
simon
standing
before
her
his
arms
hanging
at
his
sides
his
face
agonized
can
not
doom
this
young
she
took
deep
breaths
to
calm
herself
enough
to
speak
to
him
simon
i
pray
that
god
will
bless
and
protect
you
she
stifled
a
sob
i
can
not
marry
you
you
must
forget
me
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
his
arms
outstretched
do
not
turn
from
me
sophia
i
would
rather
have
you
kill
me
no
it
came
out
of
her
as
a
scream
she
turned
and
started
to
run
holding
up
the
hem
of
her
long
skirt
to
keep
from
tripping
her
anguish
was
like
a
giant
hand
that
had
seized
her
heart
and
was
crushing
it
she
ran
like
a
hunted
animal
tripping
on
rocks
turning
her
ankle
in
hollow
places
she
could
only
hope
she
was
running
toward
the
road
sophia
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
he
was
following
her
out
of
the
forest
but
at
a
distance
he
was
walking
staggering
like
a
wounded
man
forgive
me
simon
she
ran
on
a
pine
branch
struck
her
across
the
face
and
she
cried
out
in
pain
but
she
felt
that
she
deserved
it
she
ducked
under
the
branch
and
kept
running
seeing
brighter
light
among
the
dark
rows
of
tree
trunks
now
the
road
must
be
that
way
she
forced
her
way
through
a
tangle
of
shrubbery
and
was
out
on
the
road
simon
scudiero
standing
with
their
string
of
horses
stared
at
her
the
huge
riccardo
sophia
escort
was
with
him
talking
they
were
standing
with
their
backs
to
a
roadside
statue
of
the
virgin
in
a
little
protective
shed
at
the
sight
of
sophia
riccardo
rushed
to
her
looming
over
her
protectively
madonna
what
has
happened
to
you
dio
mio
did
he
his
eyes
were
wide
with
outrage
but
there
was
anxiety
in
his
face
too
he
must
be
wondering
whether
he
would
have
to
fight
a
nobleman
i
am
not
hurt
he
did
nothing
he
did
nothing
sophia
babbled
choking
down
sobs
mount
quickly
riccardo
and
let
us
go
from
here
he
held
her
horse
and
she
threw
herself
into
the
saddle
she
spurred
on
without
waiting
to
see
if
riccardo
was
ready
to
follow
when
they
came
to
a
turning
in
the
road
she
looked
back
once
the
scudiero
stood
alone
with
the
horses
simon
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
pine
forest
she
started
to
cry
again
the
pain
in
her
chest
was
worse
than
ever
she
silenced
riccardo
questions
i
can
not
talk
about
it
he
did
no
wrong
to
me
no
harm
that
is
all
you
need
to
know
can
not
talk
to
anyone
about
it
ever
i
am
going
to
betray
david
i
pray
god
i
never
see
simon
de
gobignon
xlviii
just
as
sophia
and
riccardo
arrived
at
the
porta
maggiore
in
the
city
wall
of
orvieto
the
air
around
them
seemed
to
glow
and
crackle
a
cold
wind
blew
across
the
road
leading
up
to
the
gate
sophia
spurred
her
bay
but
the
horse
hardly
needed
encouragement
to
gallop
the
last
few
paces
to
the
shelter
of
the
gatehouse
a
shaft
of
lightning
dazzled
sophia
and
a
mighty
thunderclap
loud
enough
to
shake
the
rock
on
which
orvieto
stood
deafened
her
she
and
riccardo
were
in
the
shelter
of
the
gatehouse
before
the
first
fat
drops
began
to
fall
making
craters
in
the
dust
of
the
road
they
identified
themselves
to
the
guards
without
dismounting
clerks
were
no
longer
posted
at
the
gates
to
interrogate
and
record
the
name
of
every
person
entering
and
leaving
orvieto
evidently
the
podesta
had
given
up
on
that
sophia
daoud
and
ugolini
had
even
so
been
chilled
by
a
polite
letter
from
to
ugolini
requesting
that
his
eminence
distinguished
guest
from
trebizond
not
leave
orvieto
without
the
permission
sophia
on
the
other
hand
seemed
free
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
the
thought
crossed
sophia
mind
that
she
would
be
soaked
as
she
rode
from
the
gate
to
ugolini
mansion
but
the
meeting
with
simon
had
left
her
in
misery
and
the
storm
suited
her
mood
david
knew
that
she
was
meeting
simon
outside
the
town
now
what
would
she
tell
david
about
where
simon
was
going
she
was
about
to
ride
on
into
the
city
streets
when
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
for
shelter
under
the
gateway
arch
he
raised
a
hand
madonna
it
was
sordello
a
private
word
i
beg
of
you
she
saw
fear
in
his
face
but
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
burned
another
feeling
she
could
not
identify
she
disliked
the
man
and
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
especially
not
now
carrying
secrets
as
she
was
but
he
served
david
and
his
disturbed
look
suggested
that
what
he
had
to
say
might
be
important
sighing
she
dismounted
gave
the
reins
of
her
horse
to
riccardo
and
walked
beside
sordello
to
an
unoccupied
corner
of
the
gatehouse
you
know
that
messer
david
has
set
me
to
find
the
informer
among
us
and
he
says
he
will
kill
me
if
i
fail
he
had
backed
her
into
the
corner
and
pressed
uncomfortably
close
to
her
his
breath
smelled
of
onions
and
he
was
altogether
repellent
what
do
you
want
of
me
the
one
person
who
might
give
me
a
clue
is
the
count
de
gobignon
and
he
has
disappeared
no
one
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
will
tell
me
anything
about
why
he
left
he
know
that
i
just
met
with
simon
why
ask
me
i
know
that
it
is
messer
david
wish
that
you
allow
de
gobignon
to
court
you
if
he
has
left
orvieto
perhaps
you
have
heard
where
he
is
going
he
smiled
showing
a
gap
in
his
upper
front
teeth
and
now
she
realized
what
the
hidden
feeling
was
it
was
lust
she
was
disgusted
and
pushed
past
him
to
give
herself
room
he
said
i
saw
you
ride
out
earlier
today
and
i
waited
here
at
the
gatehouse
for
you
to
come
back
you
must
have
met
with
the
count
madonna
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
and
messer
david
will
kill
me
if
i
do
not
tell
him
something
she
desperately
wanted
to
get
away
i
am
going
to
messer
david
myself
to
tell
him
that
count
simon
has
left
for
perugia
where
the
pope
is
going
he
is
recruiting
more
guards
and
preparing
a
refuge
for
the
tartar
ambassadors
you
gain
nothing
with
messer
david
by
telling
him
the
same
thing
sordello
frowned
thoughtfully
no
but
i
might
try
to
catch
count
simon
on
the
road
and
talk
to
him
sophia
heart
leapt
with
alarm
and
seemed
to
lodge
in
her
throat
what
if
sordello
followed
simon
and
discovered
he
was
on
his
way
to
france
and
came
back
and
reported
to
daoud
you
need
go
to
all
that
trouble
she
said
keeping
a
grip
on
her
voice
we
will
all
be
going
to
perugia
shortly
and
you
can
question
count
simon
there
he
nodded
as
if
satisfied
with
that
and
she
felt
a
little
better
he
bowed
again
and
again
thank
you
madonna
thank
you
in
a
moment
she
was
on
her
horse
again
and
riding
into
the
rain
she
wanted
nothing
more
to
do
with
sordello
but
the
encounter
had
helped
her
in
one
way
and
now
she
felt
more
confident
about
talking
to
david
about
simon
rehearsing
the
lie
with
sordello
had
helped
he
is
leaving
the
tartars
behind
after
i
came
so
close
to
killing
them
they
will
be
closely
guarded
i
do
not
think
you
will
be
able
to
get
at
them
again
there
was
a
bitterness
in
the
small
smile
that
quirked
david
thin
lips
i
do
not
intend
to
try
until
the
sienese
arrive
here
when
i
seek
their
lives
again
a
whole
army
of
guards
will
not
be
enough
to
stop
me
what
would
david
do
sophia
wondered
if
he
learned
that
the
alliance
he
had
fought
so
hard
to
prevent
would
soon
be
sealed
in
france
by
simon
de
gobignon
she
looked
at
david
eyes
the
color
of
the
thunderclouds
outside
her
hatred
for
herself
struck
her
heart
with
hammer
blows
he
stood
by
the
window
of
his
room
straight
and
wearing
a
belted
gown
of
black
silk
with
a
broad
red
stripe
at
the
bottom
his
wound
no
longer
required
a
poultice
and
it
was
almost
healed
the
strange
saracen
treatment
he
had
prescribed
for
himself
had
worked
she
saw
pain
in
his
eyes
a
pain
of
the
heart
no
doubt
you
will
miss
the
count
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
turned
to
look
out
the
window
he
had
pulled
the
leaded
pane
of
glass
slightly
inward
on
its
hinge
letting
into
the
room
the
cold
breeze
stirred
up
by
the
storm
locks
of
his
blond
hair
fluttered
around
his
forehead
she
studied
his
profile
the
nose
long
and
straight
the
chin
sharp
the
brows
seeming
to
frown
even
when
relaxed
you
wanted
me
to
make
love
to
him
she
said
softly
he
kept
his
face
turned
yes
you
did
not
want
me
to
make
love
to
him
yes
she
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
about
ten
paces
from
him
her
hands
clasped
before
her
her
shawl
and
her
gown
were
cold
and
wet
a
net
of
small
pearls
held
her
hair
in
place
but
her
hair
too
was
sodden
with
rain
she
felt
on
the
verge
of
shivering
but
she
held
herself
very
still
white
light
filled
the
room
david
body
jerked
and
his
lips
tightened
a
long
rolling
peal
of
thunder
followed
the
lightning
ending
in
a
crash
so
loud
it
hurt
her
head
he
was
afraid
of
thunderstorms
she
had
noticed
that
before
there
was
little
rain
in
the
part
of
the
world
where
he
had
grown
up
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
else
as
far
as
she
could
see
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
do
nothing
he
not
do
if
only
he
were
greek
what
a
fighter
for
the
polis
he
would
be
but
when
he
winced
away
from
the
lightning
she
wanted
to
cradle
his
blond
head
against
her
breasts
the
rain
beat
down
on
the
walls
and
roof
of
ugolini
mansion
with
redoubled
intensity
she
saw
a
small
pool
of
water
on
the
wood
floor
rain
blown
in
through
the
open
window
i
never
did
make
love
to
him
she
said
raising
her
voice
to
be
heard
over
the
wind
and
rain
i
know
that
he
took
a
step
toward
her
am
doing
worse
than
that
she
thought
with
a
stab
of
guilt
am
keeping
from
david
something
he
would
badly
want
to
he
put
his
arms
around
me
and
kissed
me
many
times
she
said
david
turned
fully
to
look
at
her
saying
nothing
whenever
he
took
me
in
his
arms
i
thought
of
you
he
closed
his
eyes
when
she
was
with
david
she
never
grieved
over
the
turns
her
life
had
taken
she
never
felt
sorry
for
herself
as
she
did
with
simon
because
she
had
not
married
and
could
not
marry
simon
had
actually
said
he
wanted
to
marry
her
and
in
the
end
she
had
believed
him
that
seemed
like
a
dream
now
a
pleasant
dream
but
an
impossible
one
for
an
instant
she
tried
to
picture
herself
a
woman
of
constantinople
wed
to
a
frankish
lord
and
living
in
a
castle
in
the
north
of
france
if
such
a
preposterous
thing
should
come
about
she
would
be
enormously
wealthy
and
powerful
though
she
had
not
really
thought
about
that
when
she
was
with
simon
she
was
not
herself
when
she
was
with
simon
and
now
when
she
herself
and
able
to
see
things
clearly
the
wealth
and
power
still
did
not
matter
because
they
would
give
her
no
pleasure
if
she
had
to
live
among
barbarians
when
she
was
with
david
she
never
worried
or
even
thought
about
her
future
what
life
would
be
like
for
her
when
she
was
older
with
david
she
thought
only
of
now
he
had
opened
his
eyes
and
was
staring
at
her
she
looked
at
him
standing
tall
and
fair
love
you
david
i
want
you
why
had
it
not
happened
soon
it
would
be
a
year
since
they
had
met
at
lucera
and
she
had
long
known
that
she
wanted
him
and
believed
that
he
wanted
her
as
well
but
something
had
always
held
him
back
her
body
grew
warm
inside
her
cold
garments
is
not
because
of
me
that
we
have
waited
this
there
was
a
question
in
his
eyes
and
she
felt
something
inside
her
pulling
her
toward
him
she
took
a
faltering
step
across
the
tile
floor
then
another
surer
one
he
held
out
his
arms
his
harsh
mouth
softening
as
his
lips
parted
slightly
come
to
me
he
said
he
watched
her
walking
toward
him
one
step
at
a
time
and
he
thought
she
looked
like
a
woman
in
a
trance
her
head
was
lifted
to
receive
his
kiss
how
like
rose
petals
your
lips
are
he
said
in
greek
he
had
never
spoken
greek
to
her
before
she
stopped
her
slow
march
toward
him
and
gave
a
long
shuddering
sigh
then
she
ran
the
last
few
steps
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
joy
flooded
his
chest
as
he
pulled
her
against
him
last
at
last
at
last
he
had
wanted
to
hold
her
like
this
for
so
long
and
much
of
the
time
had
not
even
been
aware
that
he
wanted
it
he
had
not
wanted
to
be
aware
of
it
he
thought
knowing
that
he
must
use
her
against
his
enemy
and
how
he
had
hated
simon
de
gobignon
simply
because
simon
was
to
have
sophia
should
have
known
then
that
my
hatred
for
de
gobignon
was
a
measure
of
my
love
for
but
he
had
not
wanted
to
know
that
either
because
blossoming
reed
the
daughter
of
the
sultan
awaited
him
in
el
kahira
and
he
had
sworn
to
be
faithful
to
her
all
his
life
as
many
women
as
you
like
but
love
always
and
only
he
felt
a
chill
and
realized
that
he
was
feeling
cold
not
merely
because
of
the
memory
of
blossoming
reed
warning
but
because
sophia
was
against
him
she
had
ridden
through
the
storm
still
thundering
away
outside
and
he
felt
a
cold
dampness
soaking
through
his
gown
your
clothes
are
wet
he
said
continuing
to
speak
greek
she
rubbed
herself
against
him
i
am
wet
to
the
skin
i
need
to
take
these
clothes
off
yes
why
not
do
that
without
hesitation
she
stepped
out
of
the
circle
of
his
arms
and
undid
the
brooch
that
held
her
printed
shawl
around
her
shoulders
she
would
not
be
shy
he
realized
there
had
not
been
time
in
the
life
she
had
led
for
hesitation
with
men
only
he
hoped
that
she
would
not
like
some
of
the
experienced
women
he
had
known
show
little
feeling
herself
while
she
let
him
use
her
in
any
way
that
pleased
him
is
not
that
sort
i
know
foolish
of
him
to
even
think
it
but
some
part
of
him
needed
to
doubt
this
moment
was
too
good
to
be
true
and
too
frightening
because
what
they
were
about
to
do
was
not
just
satisfy
their
bodies
hungers
it
would
seal
the
bond
of
love
between
them
and
then
he
would
not
be
able
to
send
sophia
like
a
falcon
to
strike
at
his
enemies
he
would
not
be
the
same
man
when
he
went
back
to
blossoming
reed
what
they
were
about
to
do
would
change
both
their
lives
standing
in
the
crumpled
heap
of
orange
and
green
silk
that
was
her
shawl
she
turned
her
back
to
him
help
me
with
the
laces
she
said
he
saw
that
her
gown
laced
down
the
back
one
small
moment
he
said
running
his
hand
caressingly
over
her
back
he
walked
to
the
door
there
was
still
pain
in
his
right
thigh
when
he
moved
quickly
but
now
it
was
overwhelmed
by
his
body
yearning
to
have
this
woman
he
felt
the
swelling
and
pressure
of
arousal
in
his
loins
he
opened
the
door
of
his
room
partway
and
looked
up
and
down
the
shadowy
corridor
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
closed
the
door
firmly
and
slid
home
the
heavy
iron
bolt
that
would
guarantee
their
privacy
she
was
standing
where
he
had
left
her
watching
him
her
amber
eyes
warm
he
went
quickly
to
her
and
untied
the
knot
in
the
laces
at
her
back
marveling
at
the
slenderness
of
her
neck
she
could
have
unlaced
the
dress
herself
he
saw
but
she
wanted
him
to
she
wore
no
belt
and
the
dress
fell
away
under
it
was
a
white
silk
chemise
without
sleeves
still
standing
behind
her
he
dropped
his
hands
gently
on
her
small
square
shoulders
and
slid
the
chemise
down
his
eyes
followed
its
fall
savoring
her
delicate
shoulder
blades
the
shadowed
hollow
of
her
back
all
that
remained
now
were
light
green
hose
attached
to
a
wisp
of
silk
that
girdled
her
hips
sophia
shivered
and
he
knew
it
was
not
the
cold
though
the
storm
was
blowing
a
strong
moist
breeze
through
the
partly
opened
window
he
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
firmly
now
and
turned
her
around
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
as
he
stared
at
her
breasts
and
bit
his
lower
lip
what
daoud
carried
under
his
black
gown
felt
as
big
and
heavy
as
a
mace
he
dropped
to
one
knee
before
her
he
reached
around
to
her
buttocks
his
palms
tingling
at
their
cool
firmness
and
he
slid
down
the
last
of
her
garments
she
stood
all
exposed
before
him
will
i
not
see
you
naked
she
said
with
a
throaty
chuckle
is
that
the
turkish
way
for
the
man
to
remain
clothed
you
will
soon
learn
what
the
turkish
way
is
my
lady
he
leaned
forward
still
genuflecting
and
dropped
a
dozen
light
kisses
on
her
belly
and
thighs
and
then
buried
his
face
in
the
rich
triangle
of
hair
between
her
legs
and
kissed
her
deeply
she
cried
out
in
surprise
and
pleasure
suddenly
he
stood
up
and
swung
her
up
in
his
arms
like
a
bedouin
chieftain
carrying
his
bride
to
his
tent
she
laughed
delightedly
she
felt
as
light
as
a
child
he
strode
across
the
room
to
the
bed
and
laid
her
down
he
wrestled
his
black
silk
gown
over
his
head
and
threw
it
off
quickly
he
pulled
off
the
locket
blossoming
reed
had
given
him
and
dropped
it
on
the
gown
he
stood
over
her
looking
down
at
her
and
letting
her
look
her
fill
at
him
the
blond
turk
she
said
in
greek
with
a
small
smile
and
moved
her
hips
from
side
to
side
slowly
she
reached
up
to
her
head
and
pulled
free
the
net
of
pearls
woven
into
her
hair
long
locks
black
as
raven
wings
spread
out
around
her
head
on
the
pillow
i
must
look
like
medusa
she
said
who
a
woman
with
snakes
for
hair
men
who
saw
her
were
turned
to
stone
he
remembered
now
in
a
bazaar
at
el
kahira
he
had
listened
to
the
story
of
the
the
sight
of
you
would
bring
a
stone
to
life
he
said
ah
but
part
of
you
is
already
hard
as
stone
how
long
are
you
going
to
stand
there
i
want
you
the
yearning
in
her
voice
made
something
vibrate
inside
him
as
if
she
had
plucked
a
taut
string
in
his
very
soul
he
was
seized
by
a
violent
urge
to
throw
himself
upon
her
and
take
her
at
once
and
she
would
welcome
it
too
he
knew
but
this
moment
was
too
precious
to
be
allowed
to
pass
so
quickly
he
sank
to
his
knees
and
reached
out
to
pull
her
hips
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
squirmed
across
the
bed
to
help
him
just
after
he
grew
out
of
boyhood
when
he
was
very
wild
and
afraid
of
nothing
ayesha
the
youngest
wife
of
emir
faruk
abu
husain
discovered
that
he
existed
and
showed
him
a
way
to
come
to
her
in
abu
harem
he
knew
he
would
die
writhing
on
a
spike
if
the
emir
slaves
caught
him
but
he
was
also
quite
certain
that
such
a
thing
could
never
really
happen
to
him
with
a
boy
eagerness
and
excitability
he
had
spent
himself
an
instant
after
he
joined
ayesha
in
the
darkness
on
her
couch
the
emir
is
very
old
and
has
many
wives
she
purred
rarely
can
we
slip
a
beautiful
young
man
like
you
past
the
harem
guards
so
we
must
learn
how
to
pleasure
each
other
there
are
many
things
that
will
delight
a
woman
body
besides
a
man
rumh
shall
i
show
you
he
was
curious
and
at
his
whispered
agreement
she
pushed
his
head
down
between
her
legs
and
told
him
what
to
do
and
put
your
fingers
at
the
same
time
ah
that
feels
very
good
he
looked
at
sophia
lying
open
before
him
and
said
again
how
like
a
flower
he
saw
dew
on
this
flower
and
he
bent
to
taste
he
did
to
her
the
things
he
had
learned
from
ayesha
and
later
on
from
other
harem
women
as
he
worked
upon
sophia
the
magic
of
the
harem
he
listened
to
her
breathing
as
it
grew
faster
and
faster
he
watched
her
breasts
rise
and
fall
her
nipples
standing
up
she
groaned
and
tossed
her
head
from
side
to
side
the
groans
turning
to
screams
as
she
reached
a
pinnacle
he
brought
her
to
another
and
another
panting
almost
crying
she
put
her
hand
on
his
head
no
more
this
way
of
the
turks
is
wonderful
but
i
want
you
inside
me
now
he
stretched
himself
full
length
beside
her
put
his
face
wet
with
her
own
sweet
liquor
against
hers
and
kissed
her
with
lips
and
tongue
she
seized
his
shoulders
her
nails
digging
into
his
muscles
and
pulled
him
over
on
top
of
her
the
way
was
so
well
prepared
that
he
was
within
her
in
an
instant
he
knew
that
he
could
not
hold
himself
back
very
long
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
floodtide
of
pleasure
he
raised
his
head
a
little
so
that
he
could
look
down
into
her
wide
amber
eyes
and
so
that
she
could
see
into
his
soul
at
the
moment
when
he
gave
all
his
force
to
her
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
muscles
in
her
face
tensed
and
her
neck
corded
through
clenched
teeth
she
cried
out
again
and
again
and
again
their
bodies
relaxed
together
daoud
felt
that
now
in
the
aftermath
of
frenzy
their
flesh
was
melting
and
flowing
together
and
becoming
one
they
lay
in
silence
and
a
distant
growl
of
thunder
told
him
that
the
storm
outside
had
passed
he
had
not
noticed
its
dying
away
he
felt
a
cool
breeze
blowing
through
the
windows
it
seemed
as
if
hours
passed
while
they
lay
there
in
silence
arms
around
each
other
legs
entwined
and
he
listened
to
her
breathing
slowly
grow
calmer
she
stroked
his
cheek
and
played
with
the
blond
hairs
on
his
chest
is
anything
changed
now
for
us
i
think
much
is
changed
she
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek
i
love
you
does
love
mean
anything
to
you
muslims
he
laughed
softly
of
course
it
does
this
world
women
and
perfume
are
dearest
to
so
spoke
our
prophet
may
god
commend
and
salute
him
she
shook
her
head
and
ran
her
finger
down
his
forehead
and
nose
i
am
glad
i
am
as
dear
to
you
as
perfume
you
say
prophet
lying
there
looking
more
french
than
simon
de
gobignon
of
course
that
is
why
your
sultan
sent
you
here
if
i
who
know
what
you
are
still
find
it
hard
to
accept
you
as
a
saracen
those
who
do
not
know
would
never
suspect
as
she
spoke
the
name
de
gobignon
he
felt
a
twinge
of
anger
just
his
name
mentioned
in
their
bed
was
an
intrusion
her
eyes
flickered
momentarily
away
from
his
as
if
she
too
realized
it
was
an
error
best
he
thought
to
say
nothing
about
it
yes
i
am
truly
a
muslim
and
muslims
know
more
of
love
i
believe
than
most
christians
but
now
he
thought
of
blossoming
reed
must
these
ghosts
hover
over
us
she
reached
out
to
touch
the
little
leather
capsule
tied
by
a
thong
around
his
neck
the
only
thing
he
was
wearing
at
the
moment
what
is
that
it
is
called
a
tawidh
inside
are
numbers
written
on
a
scroll
it
protects
me
from
death
by
wounding
and
causes
any
wounds
i
do
receive
to
heal
quickly
tawidh
she
mimicked
exactly
the
arabic
pronunciation
how
can
numbers
on
a
scroll
protect
from
wounds
he
did
not
fully
understand
himself
the
sufi
belief
that
all
things
are
numbers
and
that
numbers
written
by
a
holy
man
could
control
objects
and
events
one
must
be
of
my
faith
to
understand
it
he
said
briefly
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
it
is
so
hard
to
think
of
you
as
a
mohammedan
david
not
mohammedan
muslim
and
david
is
not
my
name
my
true
name
is
arabic
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
oh
yes
please
i
will
use
it
with
you
when
we
are
alone
together
i
am
called
daoud
ibn
abdallah
daoud
is
arabic
for
david
then
your
name
david
no
it
is
daoud
he
said
the
sound
matters
a
great
deal
it
is
the
sound
that
god
hears
you
believe
that
god
speaks
arabic
it
is
the
language
most
pleasing
to
him
did
he
not
give
his
message
to
the
prophet
may
god
praise
and
salute
him
in
arabic
she
pulled
herself
closer
to
him
ah
david
daoud
do
not
talk
to
me
of
religion
now
here
and
now
let
us
think
not
of
religions
and
empires
and
wars
but
only
of
you
and
me
she
paused
and
looked
at
him
a
little
anxiously
do
you
think
the
servants
or
anyone
else
heard
me
screaming
i
saw
no
one
outside
most
of
them
probably
suspect
that
we
have
been
lovers
for
a
long
time
but
suspicion
is
one
thing
to
confirm
it
by
our
outward
behavior
could
be
dangerous
we
must
continue
to
act
as
if
this
never
happened
we
will
do
this
again
will
we
not
he
touched
her
dark
red
lips
with
his
fingertips
and
said
after
suffering
the
joy
of
love
i
have
no
abiding
place
i
live
only
to
be
with
the
one
i
love
yes
we
will
do
it
again
very
soon
now
i
feel
my
strength
returning
he
curved
his
hand
around
the
softness
of
her
breast
ah
good
i
did
not
want
it
to
be
over
yet
daoud
in
the
first
days
of
the
christian
month
of
july
the
sun
grew
very
strong
and
above
the
narrow
streets
and
tiny
gardens
dust
rose
daoud
found
the
climate
more
to
his
liking
although
he
believed
he
would
never
have
a
true
home
or
enjoy
peace
in
this
life
he
felt
a
happiness
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
and
this
was
strange
because
hulagu
khan
emissaries
to
the
christians
still
lived
and
was
still
threatened
with
destruction
and
while
he
turned
many
plans
over
in
his
mind
he
was
not
sure
what
to
do
next
but
when
he
and
sophia
were
together
he
was
able
almost
entirely
to
forget
those
threats
and
when
he
was
not
with
her
he
carried
her
image
in
his
heart
and
his
heart
was
the
lighter
for
it
his
leg
had
healed
and
it
was
safe
for
him
to
walk
the
streets
now
he
knew
the
podesta
men
must
be
watching
him
but
he
feared
them
less
now
because
they
would
not
see
him
limp
they
might
wonder
when
he
had
returned
to
orvieto
from
perugia
but
they
would
have
to
suppose
it
was
after
the
podesta
took
the
clerks
away
from
the
gates
each
day
he
wandered
through
the
town
forming
plans
observing
he
sensed
a
tension
in
the
air
growing
a
little
stronger
each
day
like
the
summer
heat
around
the
palace
of
the
filippeschi
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
in
its
windows
and
on
its
battlements
men
stood
watchful
holding
crossbows
hands
on
their
sword
hilts
they
were
not
as
strong
as
they
had
been
last
april
the
bravos
lorenzo
had
gathered
and
daoud
had
lent
to
their
cause
had
quietly
left
orvieto
the
filippeschi
had
lost
many
men
and
were
thrown
back
on
their
own
resources
now
their
grim
apprehension
was
obvious
daoud
did
not
speak
directly
to
the
filippeschi
aside
from
his
one
meeting
with
their
leader
marco
he
had
avoided
any
contact
with
them
that
might
compromise
him
he
wondered
whether
marco
had
given
any
thought
to
a
suggestion
lorenzo
had
made
to
him
that
aid
might
be
forthcoming
if
the
filippeschi
switched
their
allegiance
to
the
ghibellino
cause
apparently
filippeschi
loyalty
to
the
pope
went
back
centuries
and
was
not
easily
changed
that
was
something
to
be
discussed
when
lorenzo
returned
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
daoud
saw
an
air
of
preparation
of
forces
gathering
of
confidence
one
afternoon
vittorio
de
monaldeschi
aged
eleven
in
full
mail
a
child
mail
shirt
and
hose
must
cost
as
much
as
a
man
and
be
usable
for
only
a
short
time
wearing
an
orange
and
green
surcoat
rode
slowly
along
the
length
of
the
corso
with
a
dozen
horsemen
orange
and
green
pennons
on
their
lances
a
show
to
intimidate
his
enemies
both
sides
seemed
to
be
awaiting
something
and
the
air
of
the
city
felt
to
daoud
as
it
did
when
a
thunderstorm
was
approaching
the
petty
street
wars
of
orvieto
would
mean
nothing
to
him
soon
daoud
thought
lorenzo
had
managed
to
send
two
messages
by
way
of
ghibellino
merchants
passing
through
orvieto
he
had
made
his
way
safely
to
siena
was
negotiating
with
rinaldo
di
stefano
duke
of
siena
and
was
recruiting
bravos
by
the
hundred
but
all
was
not
going
quickly
enough
for
daoud
with
the
pope
on
the
verge
of
leaving
orvieto
it
appeared
the
sienese
would
not
come
quickly
enough
unless
lorenzo
and
the
sienese
arrived
in
time
to
trap
the
pope
and
the
tartars
here
he
would
have
to
follow
them
to
perugia
or
he
could
go
to
manfred
and
urge
him
to
make
immediate
war
on
the
pope
every
rumormonger
in
orvieto
claimed
that
manfred
was
on
the
brink
of
marching
out
of
southern
italy
to
make
the
whole
peninsula
his
but
daoud
doubted
it
it
would
probably
be
difficult
to
persuade
manfred
to
take
any
action
against
the
pope
unless
the
french
actually
invaded
italy
every
day
he
and
sophia
spent
hours
together
sometimes
in
his
chamber
sometimes
in
hers
they
chose
different
times
of
the
day
hoping
to
make
their
meetings
less
obvious
the
best
times
were
the
afternoons
most
orvietans
slept
an
hour
or
two
after
their
noon
meal
just
as
most
egyptians
did
sophia
and
daoud
would
draw
the
curtains
to
hold
out
the
heat
and
dust
they
would
make
love
their
bodies
slippery
with
sweat
then
they
would
lie
side
by
side
and
let
themselves
cool
talking
of
what
they
felt
about
each
other
of
the
world
of
the
mission
they
had
come
to
orvieto
to
accomplish
they
never
spent
an
entire
night
together
this
would
cause
too
much
gossip
among
ugolini
servants
for
the
benefit
of
the
podesta
and
whoever
else
might
be
watching
them
daoud
wanted
to
maintain
the
fiction
that
he
was
a
trader
from
trebizond
far
to
the
east
and
sophia
a
sicilian
girl
from
siracusa
and
they
had
very
little
to
do
with
each
other
alone
in
his
bed
at
night
daoud
sometimes
lay
awake
thinking
about
what
sophia
had
come
to
mean
to
him
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
he
realized
now
long
before
he
first
possessed
her
body
if
it
was
their
fate
to
die
here
in
italy
at
least
they
would
have
known
this
happiness
first
but
if
he
succeeded
in
his
mission
and
if
he
and
sophia
were
still
alive
after
that
what
then
return
to
his
emir
palace
in
el
kahira
to
blossoming
reed
bringing
sophia
with
him
a
greek
christian
woman
entering
a
mameluke
harem
and
even
if
sophia
were
willing
blossoming
reed
would
try
to
kill
her
but
sophia
would
make
a
formidable
enemy
for
blossoming
reed
no
he
could
not
subject
either
of
them
to
that
or
himself
but
for
him
what
else
was
there
el
kahira
was
the
only
home
he
knew
he
had
left
it
only
to
protect
it
he
must
return
all
this
thinking
he
decided
was
foolishness
what
would
happen
was
written
in
the
book
of
god
and
one
could
be
sure
only
that
it
would
be
very
different
from
what
he
expected
let
him
concentrate
on
following
the
path
as
far
ahead
as
he
could
see
clearly
and
the
next
stage
would
be
revealed
when
god
turned
the
page
an
orange
radiance
suffused
cardinal
ugolini
dining
hall
gilding
dust
motes
that
hung
in
the
air
a
stout
maidservant
cleared
away
the
trenchers
the
round
slices
of
bread
on
which
ugolini
had
served
spring
lamb
to
daoud
and
sophia
she
bundled
up
the
knives
and
forks
in
her
apron
daoud
fork
was
clean
he
preferred
among
friends
not
to
use
the
strange
implement
which
seemed
to
him
a
bida
an
undesirable
innovation
he
ate
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
his
holiness
takes
the
road
for
perugia
a
week
from
tomorrow
said
ugolini
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
intend
to
do
david
we
must
await
lorenzo
coming
he
and
the
sienese
may
be
here
before
the
pope
leaves
i
assure
you
that
if
that
were
possible
the
pope
would
be
galloping
out
of
town
right
now
said
ugolini
his
information
is
better
than
ours
sophia
daintily
wiped
her
hands
and
lips
with
the
linen
cloth
that
covered
the
table
your
eminence
messer
david
i
want
to
use
these
long
july
hours
of
daylight
for
painting
i
beg
to
be
excused
she
refused
more
wine
and
genially
overrode
ugolini
protests
carefully
keeping
his
face
blank
daoud
watched
her
walk
out
of
the
room
tall
and
straight
in
a
gown
he
found
himself
picturing
the
things
they
had
done
not
long
ago
while
orvieto
rested
at
midday
he
turned
back
to
ugolini
to
see
the
little
cardinal
was
also
with
a
lubricious
smile
watching
sophia
ugolini
long
nose
twitched
with
amusement
as
he
turned
to
daoud
there
have
been
times
when
i
thought
there
was
a
chamber
of
torment
on
the
top
floor
of
my
mansion
the
groans
the
screams
i
have
heard
nothing
your
eminence
said
daoud
keeping
his
face
expressionless
i
should
have
been
concerned
for
the
lovely
lady
except
that
she
is
obviously
so
healthy
and
serene
much
more
serene
i
believe
than
when
she
first
came
here
what
do
you
suppose
accounts
for
that
daoud
shrugged
in
silence
is
security
from
error
is
that
a
saying
of
one
of
your
muslim
philosophers
yes
said
daoud
allowing
himself
the
faintest
of
smiles
the
princess
sheherazade
the
sun
had
set
by
the
time
daoud
left
cardinal
ugolini
and
the
corridor
was
nearly
dark
servants
had
placed
small
candles
on
tables
at
each
end
of
the
corridor
daoud
had
allowed
himself
a
cup
of
wine
with
the
cardinal
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
drink
and
now
his
face
felt
slightly
numb
a
large
figure
walked
slowly
toward
him
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
corridor
as
he
approached
his
room
with
the
candlelight
behind
him
the
man
face
was
in
darkness
and
daoud
tensed
himself
messer
david
it
is
riccardo
now
they
stood
daoud
having
to
look
up
a
little
i
searched
everywhere
questioned
everyone
i
know
i
would
stake
my
life
that
sordello
is
not
in
orvieto
he
went
out
the
perugia
gate
after
talking
to
madonna
sophia
i
do
not
think
he
ever
came
back
dismissing
riccardo
daoud
went
into
his
room
to
think
and
to
pray
he
felt
baffled
he
would
have
staked
life
that
no
man
bound
by
the
powers
of
the
hashishiyya
would
ever
turn
against
the
one
who
showed
him
the
delights
of
paradise
i
did
threaten
him
with
death
and
he
saw
that
i
wanted
to
kill
him
that
might
have
been
enough
to
break
the
i
did
wonder
even
when
i
initiated
him
whether
there
might
not
be
some
part
of
him
that
remained
daoud
bolted
the
door
of
his
room
he
needed
to
be
alone
to
think
and
to
refresh
his
mind
he
faced
the
spot
on
his
wall
that
marked
the
direction
of
mecca
and
with
care
and
thought
went
through
the
sequence
of
the
salat
standing
bowing
kneeling
striking
his
head
on
the
floor
again
and
again
until
he
was
done
he
asked
god
as
he
did
every
night
to
favor
his
efforts
here
in
italy
with
success
out
of
his
love
for
the
people
of
islam
place
all
in
your
after
he
was
finished
praying
he
unlocked
his
traveling
chest
and
began
to
take
things
from
it
first
came
a
small
grinder
box
he
had
bought
from
an
orvieto
ironsmith
a
grinder
such
as
women
used
to
make
small
amounts
of
flour
next
from
a
cotton
bag
he
took
two
handfuls
of
roasted
kaviyeh
beans
given
him
by
ugolini
and
put
them
in
the
top
of
the
grinder
box
he
ran
the
beans
through
the
grinder
rapidly
turning
the
crank
on
the
box
until
they
were
a
coarse
powder
he
took
his
old
pack
out
of
the
chest
and
found
in
it
the
brick
of
hashish
wrapped
in
oiled
parchment
it
nestled
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
he
weighed
it
wondering
whether
he
deserved
this
pleasure
for
that
matter
did
he
deserve
sophia
his
attempt
to
kill
the
tartars
had
failed
and
now
they
might
be
slipping
out
of
his
grasp
with
money
and
the
threat
of
a
french
invasion
lorenzo
should
be
able
to
persuade
the
ghibellino
leaders
of
siena
to
follow
their
natural
inclination
and
send
an
army
against
orvieto
but
that
army
would
not
be
enough
to
counter
the
forces
the
pope
could
gather
around
himself
at
perugia
must
get
manfred
to
with
manfred
help
he
could
capture
the
pope
and
kill
the
tartars
and
he
saw
an
even
larger
vision
under
manfred
italy
could
become
a
bulwark
against
the
crusaders
from
northern
europe
manfred
was
not
just
friendly
to
egypt
he
had
muslim
officials
and
soldiers
and
was
not
far
from
being
a
muslim
himself
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
daoud
wanted
to
go
to
siena
to
hasten
the
ghibellino
attack
on
orvieto
he
wanted
to
ride
to
manfred
and
urge
him
to
invade
the
papal
states
but
he
had
to
remain
here
as
long
as
the
tartars
were
here
were
it
not
for
sophia
these
months
of
inactivity
since
that
night
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
would
be
driving
him
mad
he
held
the
black
hashish
cake
over
the
grinder
using
his
dagger
to
shave
small
coiling
peels
into
the
ground
kaviyeh
beans
then
he
filled
a
small
iron
pot
from
his
water
jar
he
poured
the
mixture
of
water
kaviyeh
and
hashish
into
the
pot
and
set
it
to
boil
on
a
rack
over
the
flame
of
short
fat
candle
he
smiled
and
inhaled
deeply
as
the
rich
burnt
smell
filled
the
room
just
the
smell
of
kaviyeh
could
give
him
visions
making
him
think
of
the
gaily
lighted
streets
of
el
kahira
of
the
dome
of
the
gray
mosque
of
the
white
arms
of
blossoming
reed
when
his
brew
was
ready
he
poured
it
into
an
orvieto
porcelain
cup
painted
with
bright
flowers
he
carried
the
cup
to
his
window
and
pulled
the
window
open
even
though
orvieto
was
atop
a
great
rock
the
starry
sky
seemed
much
farther
away
here
than
when
he
lay
on
his
back
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
in
the
desert
he
wondered
how
far
it
was
to
the
crystalline
sphere
in
which
the
stars
were
set
like
jewels
was
it
farther
than
the
distance
between
orvieto
and
el
kahira
he
recited
to
himself
the
invocation
the
name
of
the
voice
comes
the
standing
at
the
window
he
drank
his
kaviyeh
in
slow
sips
when
he
knew
by
a
peculiar
intensity
in
the
starlight
that
the
magic
horse
had
begun
its
flight
to
paradise
he
started
to
walk
to
his
bed
a
sudden
impulse
took
him
and
he
went
to
his
pack
again
folded
inside
a
square
of
blue
silk
he
found
the
silver
locket
blossoming
reed
had
given
him
since
he
had
started
lying
with
sophia
he
had
stopped
wearing
it
he
remembered
the
suggestion
he
had
planted
in
sordello
mind
that
at
the
sight
of
the
locket
he
would
kill
simon
de
gobignon
with
sordello
and
simon
both
gone
the
locket
was
useless
for
that
purpose
as
he
held
it
in
his
hands
he
remembered
what
baibars
daughter
had
said
to
him
will
always
know
if
you
are
well
or
ill
alive
or
dead
and
how
you
fare
and
what
you
feel
and
if
you
would
know
how
it
is
with
me
seek
me
in
he
lay
in
bed
propped
up
on
one
elbow
and
turned
the
tiny
screw
that
held
the
locket
closed
he
had
meant
to
think
about
manfred
and
sophia
to
try
to
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
future
it
troubled
him
that
he
had
taken
this
bypath
he
remembered
now
how
troubled
he
had
been
when
last
he
looked
into
the
locket
he
had
not
meant
to
use
it
again
now
though
it
was
somehow
too
late
for
him
to
stop
he
seemed
to
have
no
will
of
his
own
he
raised
the
lid
of
the
locket
and
looked
down
into
it
at
the
design
incised
on
rock
crystal
that
looked
like
an
interweaving
of
arabic
letters
with
circles
and
triangles
he
waited
to
see
what
visions
the
locket
would
give
him
tonight
knowledge
you
run
from
is
the
most
precious
of
he
gasped
a
pool
of
darkness
opened
in
the
center
of
the
design
the
network
of
straight
and
curved
lines
seemed
to
crumble
into
it
as
the
pool
spread
and
it
began
to
rotate
slowly
at
first
then
faster
he
was
looking
into
a
whirlpool
of
blackness
it
drew
him
in
he
felt
as
if
his
eyes
were
spinning
then
his
head
then
he
fell
into
the
whirlpool
and
it
sucked
him
down
he
could
not
breathe
he
was
drowning
in
blackness
at
the
last
moment
when
he
thought
he
would
die
suffocated
the
black
pool
released
him
and
flung
him
back
on
his
bed
contemptuously
rejecting
him
he
lay
there
gasping
terrified
as
many
women
as
you
like
but
love
always
and
only
me
for
if
you
do
love
another
i
promise
you
that
your
love
will
destroy
both
her
and
had
he
truly
heard
the
voice
of
blossoming
reed
burning
and
cruel
in
his
mind
coming
from
as
far
off
as
the
stars
the
locket
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
that
seemed
to
shake
the
stone
building
in
which
he
lay
he
remained
motionless
paralyzed
with
dread
xlix
feeling
as
if
he
would
burst
into
flames
with
anger
simon
stood
under
a
bright
blue
sky
dappled
with
high
white
clouds
on
a
wooden
quay
at
livorno
two
weeks
after
leaving
orvieto
the
masts
of
small
boats
lined
the
waterfront
like
a
forest
of
tree
trunks
stripped
of
their
leaves
i
were
traveling
with
a
proper
entourage
a
few
knights
and
a
troop
of
archers
by
god
wounds
they
carry
me
these
shipmasters
are
too
damned
one
large
ship
anchored
midway
between
the
shore
and
the
arm
of
the
harbor
looked
to
simon
like
his
last
chance
leaving
thierry
on
the
quay
he
dropped
a
silver
denaro
into
the
callused
palm
of
a
man
with
a
dinghy
and
had
himself
rowed
out
to
the
big
ship
from
what
he
knew
of
ships
this
was
a
buss
sitting
high
in
the
water
with
rounded
prow
and
stern
the
name
was
painted
on
the
stern
human
muscle
moved
it
simon
counted
ten
oarholes
on
each
side
as
he
trod
the
catwalk
from
the
prow
of
the
ship
to
the
stern
castle
where
the
captain
stood
simon
saw
no
one
sitting
at
the
oars
and
no
chains
so
the
ship
must
be
rowed
by
its
crew
free
mariners
a
square
sail
furled
at
present
mounted
on
a
single
mast
amidships
would
help
the
rowers
when
the
wind
was
right
the
captain
whose
bald
scalp
was
brown
as
leather
bowed
deeply
when
simon
presented
himself
he
was
half
simon
height
twice
as
broad
and
all
muscle
he
smiled
showing
a
full
set
of
bright
white
teeth
when
simon
explained
that
he
needed
passage
to
marseilles
bon
seigner
you
must
understand
that
it
is
not
a
simple
matter
to
engage
a
ship
of
this
size
to
carry
you
wherever
you
wish
to
go
the
language
the
captain
spoke
was
neither
french
nor
italian
simon
recognized
it
at
once
and
he
felt
a
little
inner
leap
because
it
was
the
tongue
his
parents
spoke
the
langue
the
speech
of
aquitaine
toulouse
and
provence
of
course
i
understand
that
simon
replied
in
the
same
tongue
but
if
you
bon
seigner
the
captain
interrupted
there
are
no
words
to
describe
how
honored
i
would
be
to
carry
you
and
no
words
to
describe
my
grief
that
i
can
not
take
you
that
could
be
taken
two
ways
simon
thought
i
am
prepared
to
pay
prodigiously
captain
said
simon
with
sinking
heart
if
the
captain
noticed
that
simon
was
speaking
in
his
own
tongue
he
did
not
remark
on
it
i
do
not
own
this
ship
that
is
the
point
you
see
bon
seigner
the
owners
have
instructed
me
to
wait
here
for
a
cargo
of
olive
oil
which
i
must
take
to
cyprus
so
i
can
not
leave
now
and
when
i
do
leave
i
must
sail
away
from
france
the
captain
was
respectful
enough
but
simon
sensed
a
hidden
glee
in
his
refusal
but
you
have
not
heard
how
much
i
will
offer
you
he
said
desperate
the
bald
man
shut
his
eyes
as
if
in
pain
it
does
not
matter
merce
vos
quier
forgive
me
but
i
have
a
duty
to
those
who
have
entrusted
this
ship
to
me
surely
there
must
be
some
other
captain
in
this
harbor
who
will
let
you
make
him
wealthy
i
have
been
to
every
other
captain
said
simon
all
have
refused
me
for
one
reason
or
another
yours
is
the
only
ship
left
the
captain
of
the
spread
his
hands
ah
well
pisa
is
only
a
little
farther
north
and
there
are
many
more
ships
docked
at
its
quays
along
the
arno
you
are
bound
to
find
one
that
will
carry
you
or
failing
that
this
is
the
best
time
of
the
year
to
make
the
journey
to
france
overland
the
roads
are
good
simon
knew
that
pisa
had
been
a
ghibellino
city
for
generations
word
of
his
coming
might
even
have
reached
enemies
in
pisa
he
was
sure
that
he
and
thierry
had
been
followed
along
the
road
they
had
taken
up
the
tyrrhenean
seacoast
the
pisans
would
be
only
too
glad
to
put
an
end
to
his
mission
and
quite
possibly
to
him
and
following
the
endlessly
winding
coastal
road
which
would
require
him
to
pass
dangerously
close
to
pisa
it
would
take
him
a
month
or
more
to
get
to
french
territory
he
decided
that
this
captain
meant
him
nothing
but
ill
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
rowboat
a
shout
of
laughter
came
floating
across
the
water
from
the
as
the
boatman
rowed
him
back
putting
simon
in
an
even
fouler
mood
looking
toward
shore
he
saw
a
man
in
a
short
dark
cape
standing
on
the
dock
with
thierry
the
boat
tied
up
at
a
piling
and
simon
gave
the
rower
a
second
denaro
and
climbed
up
a
short
ladder
to
the
quay
with
a
jolt
of
anger
he
recognized
the
man
talking
to
thierry
as
sordello
the
devil
is
he
doing
here
instantly
sordello
was
kneeling
at
simon
feet
clutching
at
his
hand
and
kissing
it
and
weeping
copiously
i
followed
you
all
the
way
from
orvieto
your
signory
i
did
not
make
myself
known
to
you
before
this
because
i
feared
you
would
send
me
away
get
up
said
simon
impatiently
we
thought
we
were
being
followed
by
enemies
we
took
unnecessary
precautions
thanks
to
you
this
utterly
unwelcome
encounter
with
sordello
added
to
the
impossibility
of
finding
a
ship
filled
him
with
an
almost
uncontrollable
rage
your
signory
on
the
roads
of
italy
there
are
no
unnecessary
precautions
the
man
expression
shifted
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
from
fawning
tears
to
a
cocksure
grin
showing
his
missing
teeth
what
are
you
doing
here
simon
demanded
i
did
not
give
you
leave
to
stop
watching
cardinal
ugolini
household
circumstances
gave
me
leave
your
signory
as
i
was
just
explaining
to
my
good
friend
thierry
here
thierry
looked
startled
at
being
so
described
the
woman
ana
who
carried
my
reports
to
you
betrayed
me
she
told
giancarlo
the
henchman
of
the
merchant
from
trebizond
that
i
was
in
your
service
that
giancarlo
is
the
sort
who
opens
a
second
mouth
in
your
throat
before
you
can
explain
yourself
with
the
first
one
does
anyone
else
in
orvieto
know
where
i
am
going
god
was
he
lurking
about
when
i
was
with
sophia
sordello
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
no
one
knew
your
signory
i
had
to
think
it
out
for
myself
i
heard
you
had
gone
to
perugia
but
i
asked
myself
whyever
would
you
do
that
there
is
nothing
in
perugia
until
the
pope
moves
there
what
then
would
be
important
enough
to
make
you
leave
off
watching
over
the
tartars
a
message
for
count
charles
i
guessed
or
perhaps
for
your
king
too
important
to
be
carried
by
anyone
but
yourself
then
i
had
to
decide
which
road
you
take
directly
north
would
lead
to
siena
and
we
have
all
heard
that
an
army
of
ghibellini
is
gathering
in
siena
to
attack
orvieto
so
you
must
be
headed
for
the
coast
and
as
we
see
my
guesses
all
turned
out
right
he
finished
up
with
a
broad
grin
how
could
a
man
so
often
foolish
also
be
so
shrewd
simon
turned
and
stared
out
at
the
water
of
the
harbor
a
deeper
blue
than
the
sky
what
a
nuisance
this
fellow
was
turning
up
now
when
simon
had
problem
enough
trying
to
find
a
way
to
get
to
france
simon
momentarily
saw
himself
running
sordello
through
with
his
scimitar
and
kicking
the
body
into
the
harbor
that
story
about
ana
betraying
him
is
almost
surely
a
lie
she
is
not
at
all
the
sort
who
would
do
such
a
thing
probably
he
himself
did
something
stupid
that
gave
him
sordello
broke
in
on
his
thoughts
thierry
tells
me
you
want
to
sail
to
marseilles
your
signory
he
pointed
to
the
ship
that
simon
had
just
left
that
buss
you
were
on
out
there
is
that
not
the
i
think
i
know
the
master
his
name
is
guibert
did
you
arrange
passage
with
him
grudgingly
simon
told
sordello
of
his
failure
with
the
captain
of
the
big
ship
sordello
grunted
it
is
not
right
that
a
man
of
your
distinction
and
wealth
and
gentle
birth
should
have
to
go
up
and
down
the
dockside
begging
for
a
ship
simon
despised
the
flattery
but
could
not
help
agreeing
with
it
his
situation
was
indeed
embarrassing
it
is
past
midday
your
signory
sordello
continued
thierry
tells
me
you
are
staying
at
the
hare
a
good
inn
i
know
it
well
you
can
get
a
decent
noonday
meal
there
for
a
denier
or
two
meanwhile
let
me
try
my
luck
i
warrant
i
will
find
a
ship
for
you
before
you
finish
your
last
cup
of
wine
tired
hungry
and
discouraged
simon
thought
least
it
will
give
me
an
excuse
to
and
sordello
had
not
yet
asked
him
for
money
or
employment
that
was
a
relief
but
simon
told
himself
to
be
ready
the
begging
would
start
soon
enough
feeling
more
relaxed
simon
was
draining
his
third
cup
of
red
wine
when
sordello
reappeared
bread
cheese
and
a
stew
of
goose
onions
and
cabbage
for
simon
and
thierry
had
cost
twelve
denari
simon
suspected
the
price
had
gone
up
when
the
host
saw
the
scarlet
silk
cape
and
purple
surcoat
he
had
worn
in
the
vain
hope
of
impressing
the
ships
captains
being
cheated
and
lied
to
is
a
normal
part
of
traveling
he
told
thierry
if
you
wish
to
avoid
it
stay
home
one
must
be
philosophical
about
it
your
signory
simon
saw
sordello
burly
figure
silhouetted
against
the
blue
sky
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
inn
he
waved
him
in
success
sordello
sat
down
at
their
table
without
asking
permission
we
have
passage
on
a
large
ship
sailing
north
and
west
along
the
coast
and
stopping
not
just
at
marseilles
but
at
whence
we
can
travel
north
through
the
rhone
valley
simon
noticed
the
we
but
said
nothing
it
takes
on
a
cargo
of
woolen
cloth
and
silk
and
spices
this
afternoon
and
it
leaves
tomorrow
at
sunup
we
can
board
our
animals
and
sleep
on
the
ship
tonight
how
much
will
this
cost
us
sordello
said
simon
his
improved
mood
making
him
feel
a
bit
like
joking
a
quick
glance
from
sordello
bloodshot
eyes
showed
he
understood
that
simon
understood
thirty
florins
your
signory
oh
and
i
promised
him
an
additional
florins
when
we
get
to
that
little
extra
after
the
passage
helps
guarantee
that
you
get
where
you
want
to
go
thierry
whistled
florins
we
could
buy
five
more
horses
for
that
sordello
shrugged
but
more
horses
would
not
get
you
as
far
and
as
fast
as
that
ship
will
and
it
is
no
more
than
count
simon
would
have
had
to
pay
if
he
had
done
the
bargaining
himself
less
simon
admitted
in
his
desperation
he
had
actually
been
thinking
of
offering
guibert
a
flat
hundred
florins
what
is
happening
here
he
asked
himself
suddenly
when
he
had
first
seen
sordello
this
morning
he
had
fully
intended
to
turn
him
away
here
in
livorno
now
he
was
paying
his
passage
to
france
again
he
was
being
taken
advantage
of
he
leaned
forward
suddenly
planting
his
folded
arms
on
the
table
but
why
must
i
take
you
sordello
eh
what
further
use
are
you
to
me
can
i
not
save
some
florins
if
i
leave
you
on
the
dock
here
sordello
looked
pained
brushing
the
curly
gray
hair
back
from
his
forehead
what
i
have
just
accomplished
shows
your
signory
how
useful
i
can
be
thus
far
you
have
nearly
ruined
my
mission
by
attempting
to
murder
an
armenian
prince
that
was
more
than
a
year
ago
your
signory
and
you
have
failed
to
learn
anything
useful
as
my
agent
in
household
your
signory
if
not
for
me
you
would
have
been
totally
unprepared
for
the
attack
on
the
monaldeschi
palace
simon
saw
that
sordello
rough
skin
was
reddening
his
bad
temper
was
threatening
to
break
through
it
was
true
though
that
sordello
warning
about
the
filippeschi
attack
by
itself
made
up
for
all
the
man
misdeeds
the
mention
of
ugolini
household
brought
back
the
pain
of
that
parting
from
sophia
he
pictured
again
that
dizzying
moment
when
he
almost
possessed
her
remembered
how
he
had
poured
out
all
his
secrets
to
her
he
saw
again
her
tears
and
remembered
his
own
that
he
had
shed
after
she
ran
from
him
the
memory
made
him
feel
like
weeping
now
hoping
to
sound
casual
simon
said
the
cardinal
niece
i
believe
her
name
is
sophia
did
you
see
her
before
you
left
orvieto
sordello
discolored
eyes
met
simon
no
your
signory
i
have
seen
little
of
her
since
the
night
of
the
filippeschi
uprising
this
brigand
simon
continued
to
pretend
to
be
casual
he
stood
up
and
yawned
the
wine
made
him
feel
less
in
control
of
his
feelings
than
he
liked
let
us
go
and
see
this
ship
you
have
found
for
us
your
signory
you
have
not
told
me
whether
you
will
take
me
back
into
your
service
simon
shook
his
head
as
if
tormented
by
gnats
after
we
see
the
ship
sordello
sighed
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
inn
they
crossed
the
roadway
that
led
along
livorno
waterfront
simon
breathing
deeply
of
the
air
to
clear
his
head
sordello
pointed
there
it
is
he
was
pointing
toward
the
same
big
ungainly
buss
that
simon
had
visited
earlier
whose
captain
had
refused
simon
but
he
said
he
was
going
to
cyprus
he
lied
to
you
said
sordello
i
know
the
man
guibert
was
shipmaster
for
a
boatload
of
us
mercenaries
in
the
last
war
between
pisa
and
genoa
he
feared
that
if
you
were
to
travel
on
his
ship
you
might
find
him
out
find
out
what
he
is
one
of
those
languedoc
heretics
who
hate
the
church
and
the
french
nobility
a
follower
of
the
waldensian
heresy
he
was
imprisoned
once
and
sentenced
to
death
in
montpellier
he
recanted
his
heresy
and
was
released
after
signing
over
all
that
he
possessed
to
the
church
but
then
he
came
to
italy
made
a
new
start
and
backslid
to
waldensianism
if
the
inquisition
got
him
now
he
would
go
to
the
stake
even
if
he
recanted
a
thousand
times
then
why
has
he
agreed
to
carry
us
to
think
the
man
had
seen
simon
as
an
enemy
simon
who
had
inherited
his
languedoc
parents
loathing
of
the
persecution
of
heretics
i
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
take
us
where
we
wanted
to
go
i
would
tell
the
officers
of
the
inquisition
here
in
livorno
about
him
said
sordello
blandly
what
simon
was
outraged
sordello
looked
hurt
surely
your
signory
does
not
see
any
wrong
in
forcing
a
heretic
to
do
a
good
turn
for
the
pope
and
the
king
especially
when
it
means
he
gets
to
go
unpunished
so
we
do
our
duty
but
with
a
leavening
of
charity
for
simon
to
say
more
would
reveal
too
much
about
himself
and
his
family
fuming
he
bit
his
lip
but
another
objection
came
to
him
we
will
have
to
take
turns
standing
guard
the
whole
voyage
he
said
that
captain
will
want
to
slit
our
throats
to
make
sure
his
secret
is
safe
we
would
have
to
stand
guard
anyway
your
signory
a
sea
captain
knows
no
law
but
his
own
greed
as
soon
as
he
puts
out
from
shore
if
you
can
pay
him
florins
that
tells
him
you
must
be
carrying
a
great
deal
more
money
but
i
have
insured
our
safety
another
way
i
have
told
him
that
an
old
friend
of
mine
here
in
livorno
knows
his
secret
and
if
that
friend
does
not
receive
a
message
from
me
in
due
course
assuring
him
of
our
safety
he
will
report
guibert
to
the
inquisition
guibert
would
never
be
able
to
come
back
to
livorno
his
home
base
and
he
would
not
really
be
safe
anywhere
in
italy
simon
shook
his
head
angrily
i
like
none
of
it
even
the
greatest
barons
even
kings
must
put
up
with
much
they
do
not
like
said
sordello
sententiously
if
they
are
to
get
anything
done
as
you
said
before
monseigneur
said
thierry
in
a
comforting
tone
a
man
must
be
philosophical
philosophical
yes
said
simon
wearily
he
could
he
supposed
afford
to
be
philosophical
if
the
heretic
sea
captain
did
not
manage
to
kill
them
in
three
or
four
days
he
would
be
in
france
on
his
way
to
find
king
louis
all
these
unsavory
doings
indignities
and
discomforts
would
mean
nothing
if
his
mission
ended
in
triumph
the
thought
of
the
king
gratitude
of
uncle
charles
respect
of
the
way
the
tale
would
spread
among
the
noblesse
of
france
bringing
him
new
honor
sent
a
thrill
of
pride
through
him
at
last
he
would
have
proven
himself
l
the
sky
was
and
a
cold
wind
unseasonably
cold
for
august
blew
down
from
the
north
daoud
stood
near
the
entrance
to
the
courtyard
of
the
palazzo
papale
facing
a
row
of
the
podesta
guards
in
yellow
and
blue
who
held
back
the
watching
crowd
a
troop
of
mounted
lancers
clattered
out
under
the
gateway
arch
then
in
litters
came
the
nine
cardinals
who
had
elected
to
go
with
the
pope
to
perugia
each
had
his
own
small
procession
of
clergy
and
guards
in
a
sedan
chair
borne
by
six
burly
men
rode
fra
tomasso
reading
a
small
book
then
came
a
hundred
mounted
archers
their
conical
helmets
gleaming
dully
under
the
overcast
sky
finally
as
the
people
threw
themselves
to
their
knees
some
crying
out
and
stretching
their
arms
wide
urban
himself
on
a
litter
carried
by
eight
with
a
column
of
priests
on
either
side
came
through
the
open
gate
of
the
palace
he
wore
white
gloves
on
the
trembling
hands
that
he
raised
to
bless
the
people
he
was
bundled
up
in
a
white
wool
cloak
and
his
head
was
covered
by
a
hood
of
fur
so
white
that
it
made
his
own
hair
and
his
beard
look
yellowish
reluctantly
but
knowing
it
would
be
dangerous
not
to
do
so
daoud
dropped
to
his
knees
as
urban
passed
him
do
not
leave
us
holy
father
a
man
next
to
him
cried
out
daoud
thought
of
the
whispers
he
had
been
hearing
in
his
wanderings
through
the
streets
and
marketplaces
people
were
frightened
some
said
that
terrible
things
would
happen
after
urban
left
there
would
be
new
bloodshed
between
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
the
sienese
would
besiege
orvieto
and
massacre
its
people
daoud
himself
believed
the
podesta
would
use
the
departure
to
try
to
increase
his
own
power
over
the
city
that
bodes
ill
for
the
podesta
was
a
clever
man
daoud
felt
certain
suspected
him
of
the
killing
of
the
french
knight
and
of
involvement
in
the
filippeschi
uprising
daoud
followed
the
procession
along
the
curving
street
to
the
porta
maggiore
intending
to
watch
it
follow
the
road
to
the
north
wishing
the
sienese
army
might
appear
suddenly
in
the
distance
and
intercept
it
but
at
the
gate
a
sergente
in
yellow
and
blue
stepped
into
his
path
i
am
not
leaving
daoud
said
staring
at
the
man
i
want
to
stand
just
outside
the
gate
the
sergente
shrugged
he
was
a
man
with
a
square
brown
face
and
a
mustache
cut
straight
across
as
they
stood
talking
he
darted
little
glances
at
daoud
hands
and
feet
half
smiling
daoud
sensed
that
he
was
ready
for
a
fight
perhaps
even
wanted
one
the
sergente
thought
of
course
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
merchant
who
would
not
be
as
skilled
in
combat
as
a
professional
soldier
daoud
felt
a
chill
along
his
spine
was
still
determined
to
keep
him
prisoner
in
orvieto
that
confirmed
daoud
suspicions
that
the
podesta
might
soon
move
against
him
you
can
watch
the
procession
from
the
top
of
the
wall
the
man
said
the
view
is
better
from
up
there
anyway
you
may
not
go
beyond
the
gate
messer
david
angered
by
the
feeling
of
confinement
daoud
thought
about
throwing
the
guard
disarming
him
and
walking
through
the
gate
just
to
teach
him
a
lesson
but
that
was
hardly
what
a
trader
would
do
that
would
only
bring
more
suspicion
down
on
him
he
nodded
curtly
and
walked
away
the
following
sunday
daoud
stood
at
the
front
of
the
cathedral
reluctantly
hearing
mass
bodies
pressing
him
from
all
sides
four
of
ugolini
including
the
massive
riccardo
stood
with
daoud
the
little
cardinal
required
by
the
etiquette
of
the
sacred
college
to
attend
but
made
fearful
by
the
rumors
of
fighting
and
killing
to
come
had
begged
daoud
to
come
with
him
and
stay
near
him
the
noonday
heat
together
with
the
heat
of
packed
human
flesh
turned
the
interior
of
the
cathedral
into
an
oven
the
reek
of
sweat
mixed
with
the
heavy
smell
of
incense
rendered
the
air
almost
unbreathable
a
gilded
screen
standing
on
the
altar
displayed
the
miraculous
linen
cloth
of
bolsena
lighted
candles
massed
around
it
the
pope
at
least
had
left
that
to
orvieto
ugolini
was
one
of
six
cardinals
half
hidden
under
their
huge
circular
red
hats
who
sat
in
chairs
in
a
row
before
the
altar
each
one
had
a
cluster
of
assistants
and
guards
behind
him
cardinal
de
verceuil
was
among
them
daoud
recognized
him
from
the
rear
because
he
was
the
tallest
of
the
six
that
meant
the
tartars
were
still
in
orvieto
if
lorenzo
and
the
ghibellino
army
from
siena
arrived
in
time
there
would
be
a
chance
to
kill
the
tartars
before
they
rejoined
the
pope
in
perugia
it
was
maddening
not
knowing
what
lorenzo
had
accomplished
or
where
he
was
this
was
one
time
he
wished
christian
armies
could
move
with
the
speed
and
decisiveness
of
muslims
or
tartars
the
elderly
cardinal
piacenza
his
arms
supported
by
held
up
the
gold
cup
of
wine
which
christians
believed
in
a
sense
that
daoud
had
never
been
able
to
understand
to
be
the
blood
of
jesus
the
messiah
the
cathedral
was
filled
with
a
reverent
quiet
a
burst
of
angry
men
voices
from
the
rear
of
the
cathedral
broke
the
silence
shouts
echoed
against
the
heavy
stone
walls
daoud
heard
thuds
scuffling
the
clash
of
steel
a
jolt
of
alarm
went
through
him
and
his
hand
went
to
his
sword
everyone
including
piacenza
turned
to
stare
the
last
time
there
had
been
a
clash
of
arms
in
the
cathedral
it
had
been
the
count
de
gobignon
and
that
heretic
preacher
daoud
thought
daoud
was
amazed
that
christians
would
interrupt
the
most
sacred
moment
of
their
mass
he
tried
to
see
over
the
heads
of
the
people
around
him
one
voice
roaring
in
protest
was
raised
over
the
others
it
sounded
familiar
to
daoud
people
were
passing
word
back
from
the
middle
of
the
nave
where
the
struggle
was
it
is
marco
di
filippeschi
a
man
near
daoud
cried
they
have
come
to
kill
him
daoud
body
went
cold
might
whoever
was
coming
after
marco
attack
him
too
the
fighting
seemed
to
be
moving
toward
the
doors
and
the
crowd
flowed
after
it
mass
was
forgotten
as
the
congregation
cardinals
and
bishops
included
rushed
to
see
ugolini
hurried
to
daoud
and
took
his
arm
the
two
of
them
were
carried
with
the
crowd
toward
the
rear
of
the
cathedral
ugolini
clutched
at
daoud
so
tightly
that
his
fingers
hurt
the
servants
daoud
noticed
managed
to
stay
with
them
stay
close
to
me
ugolini
said
you
might
be
safer
in
the
cathedral
said
daoud
outside
there
is
more
room
to
run
the
ugolini
could
not
run
very
far
thought
daoud
he
steeled
himself
if
they
were
attacked
by
a
large
number
of
enemies
they
were
dead
men
daoud
and
ugolini
came
through
the
main
door
of
the
cathedral
together
and
stood
on
the
crowded
steps
i
can
not
see
ugolini
cried
people
on
the
steps
below
him
were
blocking
his
view
daoud
was
tall
enough
to
see
quite
well
his
heart
beating
rapidly
seemed
to
be
rising
from
his
chest
to
his
throat
marco
di
filippeschi
his
long
black
hair
flying
as
he
jerked
his
body
from
side
to
side
was
struggling
with
four
men
who
held
him
while
a
fifth
wrapped
a
rope
around
his
arms
other
men
used
pikes
to
push
back
the
crowd
forming
a
ring
of
space
around
the
young
filippeschi
leader
and
his
captors
is
going
to
daoud
thought
feeling
cold
sweat
all
over
his
skin
he
looked
to
the
edges
of
the
piazza
and
the
mansions
that
overlooked
it
he
saw
crossbowmen
in
the
orange
and
green
livery
of
the
monaldeschi
on
rooftops
and
in
windows
and
mounted
lancers
in
the
outlets
to
the
square
filippeschi
should
have
missed
mass
god
damn
your
puzzolenti
souls
you
bastards
marco
roared
as
he
fought
may
your
mothers
and
fathers
burn
in
hell
some
men
were
trying
to
help
marco
daoud
saw
little
knots
of
struggle
as
his
eyes
traveled
over
the
crowd
but
no
one
could
reach
marco
because
the
orange
monaldeschi
tunics
were
everywhere
what
is
ugolini
demanded
they
are
killing
marco
di
filippeschi
said
daoud
thinking
helped
me
he
needs
help
his
hand
gripped
the
hilt
of
his
sword
tightly
and
he
wanted
to
draw
it
and
rush
down
the
stairs
to
fight
beside
marco
but
the
knowledge
that
anyone
who
went
to
marco
aid
would
die
with
him
held
him
motionless
daoud
was
not
free
to
draw
his
sword
for
marco
not
while
the
tartar
ambassadors
lived
and
the
pope
might
yet
proclaim
a
new
crusade
marco
was
shouting
obscenities
so
rapidly
that
daoud
italian
failed
him
and
he
could
not
understand
the
filippeschi
chieftain
was
tightly
bound
and
helpless
and
the
men
around
him
pushed
him
to
his
knees
be
merciful
to
daoud
prayed
lift
me
up
so
i
can
see
ugolini
cried
to
his
you
do
not
want
to
see
said
daoud
but
riccardo
obediently
hoisted
him
up
to
sit
on
his
shoulders
the
cardinal
looked
ridiculous
daoud
thought
like
an
overdressed
child
being
carried
by
his
father
a
man
holding
a
long
sword
stepped
out
of
the
empty
space
surrounding
marco
di
filippeschi
daoud
drew
in
a
breath
the
crowd
gasped
the
blade
flashed
in
the
sun
like
a
mirror
as
he
swung
it
up
marco
struggled
shouting
curses
twisting
and
thrashing
to
escape
the
sword
blood
splashed
over
the
paving
stones
as
the
sword
came
down
marco
cried
out
in
agony
it
took
three
strokes
to
behead
him
as
much
death
as
daoud
had
seen
this
sickened
him
he
felt
bile
flooding
his
stomach
and
rising
in
his
throat
after
marco
head
lay
apart
from
his
body
in
a
rapidly
spreading
pool
of
blood
the
silence
was
shocking
in
the
piazza
that
had
an
instant
before
rung
with
his
cries
as
shocking
as
the
look
of
the
bound
body
without
its
head
a
woman
piercing
scream
broke
the
silence
holding
a
baby
in
her
arms
she
burst
out
of
the
ring
of
men
who
had
cordoned
off
the
beheading
she
knelt
screaming
and
sobbing
and
reached
out
with
one
hand
to
touch
marco
severed
head
another
woman
ran
out
of
the
crowd
with
a
dagger
in
her
hand
she
pounced
on
the
mother
and
baby
and
stabbed
and
stabbed
a
pikeman
in
an
orange
tunic
dragged
the
baby
from
its
mother
arms
tossed
it
in
the
air
and
caught
it
on
the
end
of
his
pike
spitting
it
some
in
the
crowd
screamed
with
horror
others
cheered
and
laughed
daoud
stomach
lurched
he
pressed
his
hand
against
his
middle
and
hoped
the
mother
had
not
lived
to
see
what
had
been
done
to
her
baby
he
wanted
desperately
to
be
away
from
there
not
just
because
he
himself
might
be
in
danger
but
because
he
could
not
stand
to
watch
he
looked
up
at
ugolini
the
little
cardinal
sat
rigid
on
shoulders
his
face
white
and
blank
his
whiskers
quivering
how
foolish
he
had
been
to
want
to
see
not
far
away
de
verceuil
dark
face
under
his
red
hat
stood
out
above
the
other
faces
in
the
crowd
on
the
steps
the
little
mouth
was
set
in
a
satisfied
smile
daoud
wished
he
could
slash
that
smug
face
with
his
sword
another
monaldeschi
set
marco
di
filippeschi
head
on
the
end
of
his
pike
and
waved
it
in
the
air
for
all
to
see
the
mob
in
the
piazza
began
to
boil
it
was
a
chaos
that
daoud
eyes
could
take
in
only
piecemeal
men
and
women
fought
with
swords
and
daggers
and
clubs
masses
of
people
shrieking
with
terror
surged
toward
the
streets
leading
off
the
piazza
where
mounted
monaldeschi
retainers
slashed
at
them
with
swords
and
drove
lances
into
them
crossbowmen
fired
into
the
crowd
from
balconies
now
daoud
heart
was
beating
so
hard
that
the
booming
of
his
blood
in
his
ears
almost
drowned
out
the
noise
in
the
piazza
this
was
a
war
breaking
out
all
around
him
a
continuation
he
reminded
himself
guiltily
of
the
war
he
had
started
no
he
need
not
blame
himself
he
had
not
started
this
these
people
had
been
slaughtering
one
another
long
before
he
came
to
orvieto
how
could
the
monaldeschi
tell
their
friends
or
the
innocent
from
their
enemies
daoud
wondered
perhaps
he
thought
it
did
not
matter
to
them
he
now
made
out
on
a
balcony
opposite
the
cathedral
steps
the
stooped
figure
of
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
her
cloak
glittered
with
gold
embroidery
and
on
her
gray
hair
she
wore
a
small
silver
coronet
she
rested
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
a
boy
her
grandnephew
vittorio
a
monster
that
child
must
be
daoud
heard
ugolini
choking
whisper
from
above
him
get
me
out
of
here
there
was
only
one
way
to
escape
back
into
the
cathedral
and
out
one
of
the
side
doors
daoud
helped
ugolini
down
from
riccardo
back
and
they
hurried
through
the
center
doorway
followed
by
his
do
not
draw
your
weapons
daoud
said
to
riccardo
and
the
others
or
you
might
get
pulled
into
the
fighting
but
be
ready
to
stand
and
fight
if
we
must
the
din
of
the
massacre
in
the
piazza
echoed
within
the
cathedral
which
was
now
mostly
emptied
out
cardinal
piacenza
had
brought
his
mass
to
a
quick
end
he
was
sitting
in
a
chair
near
the
altar
looking
stricken
and
a
young
priest
was
mopping
the
old
cardinal
forehead
with
a
white
cloth
on
one
side
of
the
nave
stood
the
podesta
surrounded
by
a
group
of
his
sergentes
in
yellow
and
blue
is
murder
in
the
piazza
and
the
keeper
of
public
order
hides
in
the
daoud
thought
the
podesta
eyes
met
daoud
as
ugolini
retinue
hurried
past
him
toward
the
rear
doors
of
the
cathedral
there
was
a
menace
in
set
face
but
he
said
nothing
as
daoud
strode
by
the
look
in
eyes
told
daoud
that
the
moment
when
the
podesta
would
strike
at
him
was
not
far
away
daoud
felt
as
if
a
ghost
had
gripped
the
back
of
his
neck
with
an
icy
hand
ugolini
muttering
to
himself
led
the
way
to
the
north
transept
a
men
in
orange
and
green
tunics
swords
drawn
barred
the
door
stand
aside
in
the
name
of
god
ugolini
cried
as
he
approached
the
monaldeschi
your
damned
bloody
quarrels
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
daoud
was
surprised
he
had
often
seen
ugolini
frightened
but
now
fear
seemed
to
have
given
him
sudden
strength
the
men
guarding
the
door
stepped
aside
the
cardinal
servants
held
the
door
for
him
and
in
a
moment
they
were
in
the
narrow
street
running
along
the
north
side
of
the
cathedral
where
they
joined
a
crowd
of
weeping
shouting
people
who
had
managed
to
break
loose
from
the
piazza
there
were
splashes
of
blood
daoud
saw
on
the
tunics
of
many
men
and
the
dresses
of
many
women
ugolini
servants
formed
a
wedge
around
him
and
in
stunned
silence
they
walked
back
to
his
mansion
daoud
felt
shaken
and
sick
his
hands
were
trembling
the
filippeschi
could
have
been
allies
for
daoud
against
the
podesta
now
he
was
alone
ugolini
small
contingent
of
armed
retainers
could
not
resist
the
town
militia
a
cold
feeling
of
helplessness
settled
over
daoud
if
only
lorenzo
would
come
back
bars
of
afternoon
sunlight
slanted
through
the
windows
of
cabinet
giving
a
fiery
tinge
to
his
red
rug
and
glistening
in
the
eyes
of
his
stuffed
owl
ugolini
sat
behind
his
table
holding
the
painted
skull
in
both
hands
and
staring
intently
at
it
as
if
it
held
the
explanation
of
what
had
happened
at
the
cathedral
this
morning
sophia
sat
in
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
daoud
stood
by
the
window
the
monaldeschi
and
the
filippeschi
are
both
guelfo
families
and
the
filippeschi
have
high
connections
with
the
church
ugolini
said
that
is
why
the
contessa
waited
until
the
pope
left
before
taking
her
revenge
i
have
seen
christians
slaughter
muslims
and
muslims
massacre
christians
daoud
said
but
today
christians
were
killing
mothers
and
infants
that
could
have
been
their
own
women
were
doing
some
of
the
killing
ugolini
smiled
at
the
skull
but
there
was
no
laughter
in
his
round
eyes
are
not
family
quarrels
the
cruelest
of
all
daoud
noticed
that
ugolini
hands
fingertips
pressed
against
the
smooth
curve
of
the
skull
cranium
were
still
quivering
as
for
daoud
himself
he
was
quite
calm
now
last
time
i
was
really
terrified
was
when
i
looked
into
the
locket
and
saw
whirling
he
was
still
angry
with
himself
about
that
knowing
what
a
foolish
thing
it
had
been
to
partake
of
hashish
when
he
was
already
in
a
dark
mood
the
fear
he
had
felt
a
month
earlier
after
taking
the
drug
and
looking
into
the
locket
remained
with
him
clinging
to
his
mind
like
some
parasitic
insect
it
rose
to
confront
him
now
as
he
looked
at
sophia
would
something
horrible
happen
to
her
because
of
him
blossoming
reed
had
threatened
just
that
and
so
far
blossoming
reed
magic
had
worked
well
since
that
vision
the
joy
he
felt
with
sophia
had
been
chilled
somewhat
by
fear
for
her
how
safe
are
now
with
the
monaldeschi
rampaging
through
the
streets
sophia
asked
ugolini
shuddered
and
the
filippeschi
those
who
are
left
will
be
striking
back
this
city
will
destroy
itself
like
a
rat
eating
its
own
innards
i
say
leave
now
all
of
us
daoud
thought
he
would
be
less
afraid
for
sophia
if
she
were
in
a
safer
place
but
where
should
he
go
where
do
you
want
to
go
he
asked
ugolini
the
little
cardinal
drew
himself
up
i
am
still
the
cardinal
camerlengo
and
will
be
as
long
as
urban
is
alive
i
am
obliged
to
follow
the
pope
as
quickly
as
i
can
to
perugia
there
is
peace
and
order
in
perugia
he
looked
at
daoud
uneasily
what
do
want
to
do
stay
here
is
hoping
to
be
rid
of
daoud
considered
perugia
but
there
he
would
have
everything
against
him
and
no
forces
to
help
him
he
must
go
to
manfred
once
the
pope
and
the
tartars
were
safely
in
perugia
only
manfred
army
would
be
powerful
enough
to
get
at
them
manfred
might
not
want
to
go
to
war
but
war
was
inevitable
clearly
the
pope
was
no
longer
neutral
he
favored
the
alliance
and
was
waiting
only
for
the
right
moment
to
announce
it
when
the
pope
came
out
for
the
alliance
the
french
would
come
into
italy
the
time
for
manfred
to
act
was
now
if
he
marched
north
and
seized
all
of
italy
including
the
person
of
the
pope
and
as
many
cardinals
as
he
could
capture
the
french
never
invade
because
a
ghibellino
pope
would
not
approve
a
joint
campaign
of
christians
and
tartars
against
muslims
then
for
certain
there
would
be
no
alliance
now
that
the
pope
has
moved
to
a
place
of
safety
he
said
aloud
only
king
manfred
can
dislodge
him
ugolini
wrung
his
hands
first
you
incite
the
filippeschi
against
the
monaldeschi
then
siena
against
orvieto
now
manfred
against
the
papal
states
sometimes
i
think
you
are
like
one
of
the
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
spreading
war
wherever
you
go
all
too
true
daoud
thought
he
turned
to
sophia
to
see
whether
she
agreed
with
the
accusation
she
looked
at
him
somberly
but
did
not
speak
he
sighed
i
am
fighting
for
my
people
for
my
god
i
too
for
people
said
sophia
quietly
her
tone
told
daoud
she
sided
with
him
and
he
felt
an
inner
warmth
and
what
have
your
people
to
do
with
this
ugolini
cried
have
you
forgotten
that
you
are
not
sicilian
but
greek
not
at
all
said
sophia
i
want
to
see
manfred
in
control
of
italy
he
is
a
friend
of
byzantium
the
franks
are
our
enemies
ugolini
shook
his
head
i
am
the
only
italian
in
this
room
and
i
weep
for
people
daoud
strode
over
to
ugolini
table
pressed
his
hands
flat
on
it
and
stared
into
his
eyes
be
for
your
people
he
said
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
neck
rose
with
excitement
as
he
spoke
he
had
wanted
to
try
to
put
strength
into
ugolini
for
such
a
long
time
ugolini
looked
bewildered
what
do
you
mean
think
what
italy
would
be
with
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
ruling
from
the
alps
to
sicily
and
a
pope
who
supports
him
a
ghibellino
pope
ugolini
looked
surprised
then
nodded
why
not
as
a
ghibellino
myself
i
would
rejoice
at
that
but
it
will
happen
only
if
manfred
has
the
college
of
cardinals
in
his
power
yes
said
daoud
and
that
is
why
i
must
go
all
the
way
south
to
lucera
where
sophia
and
lorenzo
and
i
started
from
ugolini
eyes
were
brighter
and
daoud
felt
with
pleasure
that
he
had
breathed
new
life
into
the
little
man
but
the
podesta
wo
let
you
leave
the
city
sophia
exclaimed
again
daoud
felt
that
cold
hand
grasp
his
neck
perhaps
he
should
have
left
long
ago
he
turned
from
sophia
to
ugolini
you
must
demand
that
he
let
me
leave
cardinal
said
daoud
feeling
less
confident
than
he
tried
to
sound
or
he
thought
he
could
escape
the
way
lorenzo
did
he
had
never
truly
been
a
prisoner
here
i
will
order
the
servants
to
start
packing
for
me
ugolini
said
of
course
i
must
make
arrangements
for
tilia
to
move
too
and
that
might
take
time
although
many
of
her
best
clients
are
gone
now
he
sounded
like
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
daoud
was
relieved
to
hear
it
daoud
turned
from
ugolini
to
sophia
the
knowledge
that
he
would
soon
leave
orvieto
where
he
had
seen
too
much
of
defeat
and
slaughter
lifted
his
spirits
he
smiled
at
sophia
and
she
smiled
back
he
knew
she
was
thinking
the
same
thought
he
was
that
they
had
hours
to
spend
together
this
afternoon
daoud
and
sophia
lay
naked
in
her
bed
legs
entwined
her
head
resting
on
his
bare
chest
what
about
me
sophia
asked
will
i
go
south
with
you
to
manfred
or
north
to
perugia
with
ugolini
with
me
of
course
said
daoud
at
the
mention
of
leaving
her
he
felt
as
if
a
cold
wind
had
blown
across
his
naked
body
he
was
surprised
that
she
was
even
considering
staying
with
ugolini
i
want
to
be
with
you
she
said
caressing
his
chest
with
a
circular
movement
of
her
palm
i
hate
the
thought
of
our
being
apart
but
with
the
pope
and
the
tartars
in
perugia
you
need
someone
there
besides
ugolini
someone
who
has
an
aim
in
common
with
yours
i
can
help
him
and
make
sure
that
what
he
does
helps
you
helps
us
he
ran
his
fingers
through
her
long
unbound
hair
i
will
think
about
what
you
said
but
i
do
not
like
it
neither
do
i
but
it
may
be
necessary
a
loud
knock
at
sophia
door
interrupted
them
something
in
the
urgency
of
the
knock
made
daoud
spring
out
of
bed
and
reach
for
his
sword
hanging
from
a
peg
on
the
wall
putting
a
finger
to
her
lips
sophia
got
out
of
bed
more
slowly
and
went
to
the
door
it
is
i
the
cardinal
called
through
the
door
in
answer
to
her
question
i
know
david
is
there
with
you
let
me
in
the
podesta
is
here
the
ghost
that
haunted
him
whenever
he
thought
of
himself
and
seized
daoud
entire
body
in
a
cold
paralyzing
embrace
his
first
thought
was
of
escape
but
probably
had
the
mansion
surrounded
sophia
and
daoud
dressed
quickly
and
opened
the
door
for
the
cardinal
has
come
here
with
twenty
or
more
ugolini
said
he
demands
that
you
go
with
him
to
the
palazzo
del
podesta
david
can
you
not
order
him
away
sophia
demanded
you
are
a
prince
of
the
church
you
did
that
before
he
waited
until
most
of
the
power
of
the
church
had
left
orvieto
said
ugolini
and
until
the
filippeschi
had
been
crushed
thinking
i
might
call
upon
them
for
help
daoud
said
you
must
try
to
escape
said
sophia
then
what
would
happen
to
you
we
will
escape
together
daoud
looked
at
her
drawn
face
and
at
that
moment
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
his
love
warmed
him
and
freed
him
from
the
grip
of
fear
this
woman
who
had
spoken
a
short
time
ago
so
calmly
of
separation
was
ready
to
run
to
dodge
arrows
to
hide
in
ditches
to
climb
walls
to
do
whatever
she
had
to
to
be
near
him
if
he
finds
out
what
you
are
we
are
all
doomed
said
ugolini
daoud
saw
that
the
small
body
was
aquiver
with
fear
he
could
imagine
what
ugolini
was
thinking
that
the
evil
he
had
dreaded
since
daoud
came
to
orvieto
had
come
upon
them
at
last
just
when
he
thought
he
was
about
to
escape
it
he
will
learn
nothing
said
daoud
he
will
torture
you
ugolini
sat
down
on
sophia
bed
and
wrapped
his
arms
around
his
stomach
we
will
all
die
horribly
me
sophia
tilia
everyone
who
helped
you
he
raised
hands
curved
like
claws
and
shook
them
at
daoud
oh
god
how
i
wish
you
had
never
come
here
sophia
sat
beside
ugolini
and
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
if
we
can
stay
calm
dear
eminence
we
can
think
of
a
way
out
of
this
even
if
he
tortures
me
i
will
tell
him
nothing
except
that
i
am
david
the
trader
from
trebizond
said
daoud
the
methods
of
resisting
pain
that
he
had
learned
from
the
hashishiyya
would
serve
him
now
you
must
not
think
of
going
with
him
sophia
cried
it
is
the
only
way
if
i
cooperate
it
shows
my
innocence
the
cardinal
can
use
his
influence
to
get
me
freed
she
jumped
up
and
threw
herself
against
him
weeping
you
are
going
to
your
death
he
held
her
tightly
has
nothing
to
gain
by
killing
me
he
said
and
surrendering
to
him
is
the
only
thing
i
can
do
he
looked
at
ugolini
do
you
agree
ugolini
sighed
and
shook
his
head
i
can
not
think
gently
daoud
freed
himself
from
sophia
embrace
god
willing
i
will
return
to
you
he
turned
to
the
door
every
muscle
in
his
body
screamed
at
him
to
run
or
to
draw
his
sword
and
try
to
fight
his
way
out
he
cringed
inwardly
from
the
thought
of
imprisonment
and
torture
he
remembered
the
poor
madman
whose
body
they
had
torn
apart
with
pincers
he
forced
himself
not
to
tremble
he
took
the
first
step
toward
the
door
then
another
make
me
strong
in
the
face
of
my
li
many
think
i
have
little
power
in
this
city
said
frescobaldo
he
sat
in
a
dark
window
recess
with
one
foot
up
on
the
ledge
and
the
other
dangling
his
fingers
tapping
the
raised
knee
lashed
to
a
chair
in
the
center
of
the
long
narrow
chamber
daoud
had
to
turn
his
head
to
look
at
him
daoud
back
ached
from
being
held
rigid
by
the
back
of
the
chair
and
the
ropes
bit
into
the
muscles
of
his
arms
and
legs
at
the
end
of
the
room
a
clerk
with
scalp
shaved
in
the
clerical
tonsure
sat
in
the
podesta
chair
behind
a
heavy
black
table
writing
down
what
was
said
on
a
scroll
with
a
feather
pen
four
tall
candles
set
in
brass
stands
formed
a
square
around
daoud
casting
a
bright
light
on
him
a
row
of
candles
burned
in
a
candelabrum
beside
the
clerk
lighting
a
wall
hanging
behind
him
that
depicted
some
idolatrous
christian
religious
scene
sat
in
the
shadows
that
lay
upon
the
rest
of
the
chamber
daoud
sensed
that
meant
what
he
had
just
said
as
a
sort
of
challenge
all
i
know
is
that
for
my
part
i
have
very
little
power
in
this
city
signore
daoud
said
with
a
smile
i
depend
altogether
on
those
who
have
befriended
me
that
was
the
way
david
of
trebizond
should
respond
not
very
frightened
because
not
guilty
of
anything
humble
ingratiating
but
retaining
some
scrap
of
dignity
stood
up
suddenly
strode
briskly
across
the
room
to
daoud
and
stood
over
him
do
you
think
your
friends
will
save
you
from
this
he
said
tonelessly
his
eyes
had
an
unfocused
look
as
though
they
were
made
of
glass
save
me
from
what
signore
daoud
put
bewilderment
and
a
shade
of
anger
into
his
voice
swung
his
hand
daoud
felt
the
sting
of
a
hard
palm
against
his
jaw
and
the
crack
of
flesh
slapping
flesh
made
his
ear
ring
the
blow
jolted
his
head
to
one
side
it
was
not
very
painful
it
was
meant
to
insult
more
than
to
hurt
to
test
and
rage
did
erupt
in
daoud
like
a
fountain
of
fire
his
muscles
tensed
the
bindings
cutting
deeper
and
the
chair
creaked
was
trying
to
break
through
the
mask
of
clay
but
the
mask
held
firm
because
the
face
of
steel
daoud
spiritual
armor
was
beneath
it
the
fury
of
daoud
the
mameluke
who
yearned
to
tear
apart
remained
hidden
it
was
david
of
trebizond
who
blustered
at
the
indignity
of
being
slapped
without
cause
how
dare
you
strike
me
signore
he
protested
i
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
that
nothing
to
deserve
being
dragged
here
in
the
night
and
tied
up
i
demand
to
know
what
do
you
want
of
me
sighed
like
a
chess
player
whose
opponent
had
escaped
check
and
went
back
to
his
seat
in
the
window
recess
daoud
saw
the
flickering
glow
of
heat
lightning
through
the
thick
window
behind
the
podesta
i
dislike
intensely
being
made
to
waste
time
said
drumming
his
fingers
on
his
knee
listen
carefully
every
time
you
force
me
to
tell
you
something
we
both
already
know
i
will
prolong
your
suffering
another
hour
daoud
allowed
a
note
of
fear
to
creep
into
his
voice
suffering
i
beg
you
signore
believe
me
even
if
you
torture
me
i
still
can
not
tell
you
anything
different
from
what
i
will
freely
tell
you
ask
me
whatever
you
want
the
mask
of
clay
was
useless
with
this
man
daoud
saw
the
mind
had
pierced
it
how
had
he
been
able
to
do
that
because
he
was
a
man
who
observed
much
and
thought
much
unlike
most
men
daoud
had
met
in
orvieto
who
let
their
passions
rule
them
yet
had
passions
he
was
a
proud
man
who
must
hate
standing
by
helplessly
holding
the
supreme
office
in
orvieto
watching
the
two
great
families
bespatter
his
city
with
blood
if
he
could
not
stop
the
filippeschi
and
the
monaldeschi
from
murdering
each
other
at
least
he
could
do
had
seen
enough
of
daoud
comings
and
goings
to
make
him
suspicious
like
a
hawk
soaring
above
a
plain
the
podesta
might
be
too
high
up
to
know
exactly
what
he
saw
below
but
he
knew
when
he
sighted
prey
and
perhaps
saw
that
this
prey
if
hunted
rightly
would
lead
him
to
others
leaned
forward
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
window
recess
there
was
a
man
in
black
who
tried
to
kill
the
tartars
the
night
of
the
filippeschi
uprising
what
do
you
know
about
him
i
know
little
about
the
uprising
signore
since
i
was
not
here
i
was
in
perugia
why
perugia
to
speak
with
several
silk
merchants
are
there
those
in
perugia
who
will
vouch
for
you
certainly
said
daoud
feeling
uneasily
that
was
not
deceived
i
will
write
to
the
podesta
of
perugia
and
ask
that
your
witnesses
be
examined
said
give
me
their
names
daoud
had
a
struggle
to
remember
the
names
of
the
witnesses
lorenzo
had
given
them
to
him
months
before
members
of
the
ghibellino
network
who
were
willing
to
perform
this
service
for
manfred
the
clerk
pen
scratched
rapidly
as
he
haltingly
brought
out
the
names
of
five
men
when
did
you
return
from
perugia
the
clerks
daoud
recalled
had
been
removed
from
the
town
gates
at
the
end
of
may
sometime
in
june
daoud
said
forgive
me
i
did
not
think
to
bring
my
journal
with
me
and
i
can
not
tell
you
the
exact
date
he
tried
a
weak
smile
where
is
your
man
giancarlo
his
way
here
from
siena
with
an
army
i
sent
him
on
from
perugia
daoud
said
he
travels
to
rimini
then
ravenna
eventually
to
venice
looking
for
those
who
would
be
interested
in
receiving
shipments
of
silks
and
spices
from
trebizond
he
had
not
been
punctilious
about
writing
to
me
or
perhaps
his
letters
have
been
lost
so
i
do
not
know
exactly
where
he
is
now
i
thought
you
were
in
competition
with
the
venetians
daoud
essayed
another
smile
that
is
why
i
sent
giancarlo
and
where
were
you
the
night
the
french
cavaliere
was
murdered
asked
i
was
with
a
woman
what
was
her
name
i
do
not
think
i
ever
knew
it
he
tried
a
flash
of
sarcasm
if
i
had
known
there
was
to
be
a
murder
that
night
i
would
have
asked
her
name
everyone
was
with
a
nameless
woman
that
night
sighed
yes
you
should
have
taken
more
care
to
arrange
for
proof
of
your
innocence
messere
he
gestured
to
the
clerk
who
picked
up
a
small
bell
on
the
table
beside
his
ink
pot
and
shook
it
a
silvery
clangor
two
broad
men
in
the
yellow
and
blue
tunics
of
the
watch
came
into
the
room
they
took
a
few
steps
toward
and
stood
awaiting
orders
like
a
pair
of
mastiffs
take
him
down
said
wait
will
you
torture
me
i
have
tried
to
tell
you
the
truth
do
not
do
this
i
beg
you
slid
off
the
window
ledge
i
am
the
sort
of
man
who
would
rather
spend
hours
picking
a
lock
than
break
it
open
the
smile
that
stretched
his
thin
mustache
was
genuine
but
as
we
both
know
the
ghibellini
of
siena
may
be
upon
us
at
any
moment
and
i
must
break
you
open
quickly
so
now
i
will
sleep
and
while
i
am
restoring
my
strength
my
men
will
prepare
you
for
our
next
talk
daoud
tried
to
keep
the
face
of
steel
firmly
in
place
while
with
the
mask
of
clay
he
feigned
helpless
terror
but
his
defense
against
feeling
seemed
to
have
flaws
genuine
terror
of
what
he
was
about
to
suffer
kept
seeping
through
when
guards
untied
him
and
forced
him
to
stand
his
knees
nearly
buckled
under
him
the
steps
daoud
descended
must
have
been
hollowed
out
by
the
feet
of
hundreds
of
hapless
prisoners
and
their
guards
the
wall
of
the
circular
stairwell
which
daoud
brushed
with
his
fingertips
to
steady
himself
was
of
black
stone
his
heart
was
thudding
heavily
as
he
descended
the
stairs
preceded
by
one
guard
followed
by
the
other
and
by
clerk
the
thought
of
hours
perhaps
days
of
pain
he
must
undergo
made
every
muscle
in
his
body
tremble
the
stairwell
lit
at
long
intervals
by
torches
held
by
wrought
iron
cressets
went
down
so
far
it
seemed
to
have
no
bottom
many
a
prisoner
must
have
felt
the
temptation
to
throw
himself
down
from
the
stairs
and
escape
suffering
the
chamber
he
entered
through
a
door
of
thick
oak
planks
had
been
carved
from
the
rock
of
orvieto
mesa
the
room
smelled
of
fire
blood
rot
and
excrement
a
man
slid
down
from
a
chair
when
daoud
entered
with
his
guards
standing
his
head
would
have
come
to
daoud
waist
but
he
was
bent
double
and
held
his
arms
out
from
his
sides
to
keep
his
fingers
from
touching
the
ground
so
his
head
was
not
even
as
high
as
daoud
knees
memories
flashed
through
daoud
mind
the
woodcutter
who
had
blessed
himself
when
daoud
was
arrested
at
lucera
the
executioner
who
had
tossed
the
heretic
cod
into
the
air
to
the
delight
of
the
crowd
before
orvieto
cathedral
daoud
had
always
wondered
how
the
little
man
had
come
to
appear
in
two
such
different
places
the
skin
crawled
on
the
back
of
daoud
neck
this
creature
was
uncanny
you
are
to
keep
him
awake
all
night
erculio
said
the
guard
who
had
followed
daoud
into
the
room
did
i
not
sleep
all
day
today
so
that
i
would
be
able
to
properly
entertain
our
guest
tonight
the
little
man
bustled
forward
to
daoud
rubbing
his
hands
his
head
was
as
big
as
that
of
a
man
but
his
hands
and
feet
were
small
his
mustache
bristled
in
spikes
of
black
hair
like
a
portcullis
over
his
mouth
please
in
the
name
of
the
mercy
of
god
daoud
pleaded
i
am
a
merchant
i
am
rich
do
not
hurt
me
i
will
pay
you
well
we
want
to
hear
nothing
from
you
except
frequent
screams
and
answers
to
the
questions
the
podesta
wants
me
to
put
to
you
said
erculio
in
a
cold
voice
what
do
we
want
to
know
vincenzo
clerk
said
the
podesta
believes
he
is
a
ghibellino
spy
sent
here
by
the
bastard
king
manfred
he
thinks
he
incited
the
filippeschi
uprising
also
he
may
have
killed
the
french
cavaliere
erculio
nodded
vigorously
well
then
messere
are
you
prepared
to
admit
your
guilt
now
that
you
see
where
you
are
and
realize
what
is
about
to
happen
to
you
these
accusations
are
false
daoud
cried
i
swear
it
the
tonsured
clerk
carrying
a
handful
of
quills
a
bundle
of
scrolls
and
his
ink
pot
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
began
to
write
to
gain
time
daoud
looked
around
erculio
domain
remembering
the
similar
room
in
tilia
brothel
where
he
had
subjected
sordello
to
the
hashishiyya
initiation
this
place
was
starker
and
more
frightful
it
was
large
perhaps
fifty
paces
on
a
side
divided
by
two
rows
of
thick
columns
holding
up
the
weight
of
the
great
stone
building
above
it
despite
its
size
the
chamber
was
well
lit
the
candle
sconces
were
lined
with
sheets
of
tin
to
throw
extra
light
daoud
recognized
most
of
the
implements
of
torment
around
the
room
a
rack
a
tilted
wooden
table
with
chains
and
winches
a
wooden
pyramid
over
which
a
victim
could
be
suspended
a
chair
with
spikes
protruding
at
the
joints
a
coffin
lined
with
spikes
a
brazier
full
of
pokers
and
branding
irons
of
various
sizes
weights
and
pulleys
whips
and
cudgels
hung
neatly
from
pegs
that
lined
the
walls
a
cage
full
of
rats
a
number
of
smaller
devices
to
crush
fingers
or
limbs
or
even
skulls
laid
out
neatly
on
tables
beside
rows
of
long
needles
daoud
visualized
himself
drinking
from
a
bowl
of
liquid
light
and
felt
the
drug
soma
pouring
down
into
his
stomach
and
spreading
to
his
heart
and
lungs
through
all
his
veins
but
still
he
must
keep
up
the
mask
of
clay
i
can
say
no
other
than
what
is
true
he
cried
i
am
david
of
trebizond
i
came
here
to
sell
silk
i
have
harmed
no
one
please
be
merciful
erculio
grunted
strip
him
and
string
him
up
daoud
protested
weakly
letting
his
voice
tremble
as
the
guards
pulled
the
clothes
from
his
body
he
felt
the
cool
dank
air
of
the
cellar
on
his
bare
skin
be
careful
erculio
said
that
is
a
good
embroidered
tunic
the
hose
and
boots
are
new
those
clothes
are
my
property
now
fussily
he
folded
the
garments
as
they
fell
away
from
daoud
and
laid
them
on
a
chair
will
you
not
return
them
to
me
afterward
daoud
quavered
afterward
erculio
laughed
what
is
this
said
one
guard
as
he
used
his
dagger
to
cut
the
thong
that
held
the
leather
capsule
around
daoud
neck
the
tawidh
that
healed
his
wounds
and
protected
him
from
death
daoud
said
nothing
they
can
truly
destroy
my
the
guard
handed
the
tawidh
to
erculio
who
glanced
at
it
and
threw
it
on
his
low
chair
he
frowned
at
daoud
put
a
loincloth
on
him
fools
he
growled
did
i
say
to
strip
him
stark
naked
are
we
not
decent
fellows
here
he
fumbled
about
in
a
pile
of
rags
and
threw
one
to
a
guard
that
the
first
time
you
complained
about
a
prisoner
being
naked
erculio
the
guard
grumbled
as
he
wrapped
the
cloth
around
daoud
hips
and
passed
it
between
his
legs
do
you
need
to
be
able
to
get
at
his
cock
do
not
try
to
teach
me
my
craft
erculio
said
snappishly
up
with
him
now
the
guards
grabbed
daoud
by
the
arms
and
pushed
him
under
dangling
chains
they
lifted
his
arms
over
his
head
and
bound
his
wrists
with
thick
leather
cuffs
then
they
went
to
a
winch
with
a
crank
on
each
side
next
to
the
wall
and
began
to
turn
in
unison
daoud
cried
out
in
pain
as
his
body
was
jerked
into
the
air
the
leather
cuffs
cut
into
his
wrists
his
shoulders
felt
as
if
his
arms
were
being
torn
out
of
their
sockets
he
pictured
the
soma
cascading
through
his
body
and
the
pain
receded
but
he
continued
to
cry
out
as
if
in
unbearable
agony
until
the
two
guards
stopped
raising
him
he
hung
there
the
mask
of
clay
sobbing
and
whimpering
erculio
scuttled
over
to
stand
under
him
holding
a
thick
stick
as
long
as
a
man
arm
daoud
feet
were
just
level
with
erculio
head
leaning
on
the
stick
erculio
looked
up
at
daoud
appraising
his
body
and
a
pink
tongue
tip
flickered
under
the
bristling
mustache
you
have
a
beautiful
body
messere
with
powerful
muscles
you
are
un
bello
pezzo
di
carne
a
fine
piece
of
meat
erculio
walked
around
behind
him
and
stopped
there
for
a
moment
where
daoud
could
not
see
him
scars
from
old
wounds
too
i
see
the
little
man
said
in
this
light
the
scar
left
by
the
tartar
arrow
looks
erculio
stood
before
him
again
you
look
able
to
endure
much
so
you
will
last
longer
you
may
think
when
a
guest
comes
down
here
i
just
pick
the
first
instrument
that
comes
to
mind
not
so
i
follow
a
strict
order
you
will
get
to
know
every
instrument
here
if
you
live
long
enough
this
will
be
very
educational
for
you
i
have
been
telling
you
the
truth
daoud
moaned
will
you
not
believe
me
bugiardo
liar
erculio
struck
him
hard
on
the
shin
with
the
stick
pain
blazed
through
his
leg
daoud
could
have
remained
silent
but
he
shrieked
loudly
knowing
that
fear
as
much
as
pain
would
make
the
man
he
was
pretending
to
be
cry
out
turning
to
the
others
erculio
said
what
will
you
wager
against
these
handsome
clothes
of
his
that
i
get
this
pezzo
di
carne
to
speak
the
words
our
honorable
podesta
wants
to
hear
a
bet
makes
this
game
more
interesting
what
say
you
any
takers
the
man
is
quivering
like
a
frumenty
now
said
one
guard
he
would
have
been
talking
long
ago
if
he
had
anything
to
say
you
think
so
erculio
snapped
his
fingers
good
bet
with
me
then
the
guard
fumbled
in
a
purse
at
his
belt
and
drew
out
a
glittering
coin
there
you
are
a
gold
florin
not
ten
years
old
and
barely
worn
i
won
it
dicing
last
night
erculio
examined
the
coin
twenty
years
old
and
the
lilies
are
a
bit
wilted
but
it
heavy
enough
i
suppose
done
now
messer
i
call
you
that
because
i
do
not
know
your
real
name
you
had
better
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
or
i
will
make
you
suffer
he
dropped
the
coin
on
top
of
daoud
clothing
erculio
brought
the
stick
against
daoud
shin
in
the
spot
he
had
struck
a
moment
ago
the
pain
shot
through
daoud
but
soma
turned
the
pain
to
a
tingling
and
daoud
visualized
it
as
a
glow
that
spread
from
toe
to
hip
he
screamed
as
he
knew
he
should
but
behind
the
face
of
steel
he
felt
at
peace
erculio
let
out
a
laugh
that
sounded
more
like
the
clucking
of
a
chicken
you
see
we
do
not
need
elaborate
instruments
we
can
inflict
unbearable
pain
with
the
simplest
means
like
this
and
he
swung
the
stick
to
hit
precisely
the
same
spot
on
daoud
shin
he
had
struck
twice
before
daoud
bellowed
and
felt
the
tingling
and
saw
the
glow
in
his
leg
and
the
soma
the
drug
created
by
his
spirit
preserved
his
sanity
how
small
erculio
looked
crouched
down
on
the
stone
floor
so
man
must
look
to
god
god
was
so
infinitely
far
above
man
the
miracle
was
that
god
was
mindful
of
man
at
all
but
god
was
inside
of
man
inside
of
each
human
being
as
well
as
above
him
is
blasphemy
to
liken
myself
to
he
called
to
mind
the
koran
admonition
is
none
like
unto
his
mind
occupied
with
god
he
barely
noticed
the
activities
of
the
spiderlike
creature
that
crawled
about
on
the
floor
below
him
as
he
hung
like
a
trapped
fly
erculio
worked
on
his
legs
for
a
long
time
bruising
the
shins
with
his
heavy
stick
until
daoud
thought
both
legs
must
be
broken
then
the
torturer
pressed
a
poker
against
the
soles
of
his
feet
erculio
had
the
guards
let
daoud
down
and
force
him
to
walk
on
his
burned
feet
to
the
rack
table
where
they
chained
him
facedown
and
stretched
him
till
the
ligaments
that
held
his
bones
together
were
ready
to
snap
the
mask
of
clay
screamed
and
pleaded
for
mercy
and
insisted
he
had
already
told
them
everything
but
the
pain
lay
as
far
from
his
consciousness
as
the
sea
lies
from
the
desert
tent
of
a
bedouin
erculio
applied
more
instruments
to
daoud
body
inflicting
many
kinds
of
pain
burning
stabbing
bruising
crushing
he
kept
daoud
awake
and
daoud
knew
that
hours
must
have
gone
by
perhaps
the
whole
night
daoud
outcries
grew
hoarser
and
weaker
and
at
last
erculio
efforts
brought
forth
nothing
from
him
but
soft
groans
and
whimpers
daoud
saw
the
clerk
vincenzo
rise
yawning
and
leave
as
another
clerk
also
but
with
a
short
brown
beard
came
in
to
replace
him
he
saw
the
two
guards
in
yellow
and
blue
sit
down
on
the
floor
their
backs
to
the
wall
and
doze
off
he
saw
after
a
time
the
second
clerk
lower
his
head
on
his
folded
arms
he
saw
all
this
while
erculio
pranced
about
him
hurting
him
and
hurting
him
erculio
looked
around
at
the
others
in
the
chamber
he
left
off
pushing
a
needle
into
daoud
ankle
and
rushed
over
to
the
guards
and
shouted
at
them
to
wake
up
he
poked
them
with
his
stick
they
cursed
him
and
kicked
at
him
and
went
back
to
sleep
he
scurried
to
the
sleeping
clerk
you
are
supposed
to
be
writing
down
everything
the
prisoner
says
come
now
wake
up
indolento
the
podesta
will
hear
of
this
i
promise
you
the
clerk
mumbled
something
without
raising
his
head
from
his
arms
erculio
nodded
with
satisfaction
and
hurried
across
the
chamber
to
daoud
he
stood
by
daoud
head
aleikem
daoud
ibn
abdallah
the
torturer
whispered
for
a
moment
daoud
could
not
believe
he
had
really
heard
it
the
drug
that
he
had
brewed
in
his
mind
had
taken
control
of
his
ears
or
else
this
was
their
way
of
tricking
him
into
talking
freely
if
they
knew
my
muslim
name
and
that
i
speak
arabic
they
would
not
waste
time
accusing
me
of
being
a
wa
aleikem
salaam
he
replied
the
uprush
of
joy
he
felt
at
finding
a
friend
here
in
this
terrible
cellar
momentarily
shattered
the
face
of
steel
what
madness
this
was
that
the
friend
should
be
the
source
of
all
his
torment
he
bit
back
hysterical
laughter
like
you
i
serve
el
malik
dahir
erculio
said
in
arabic
hearing
that
title
daoud
thought
it
even
less
likely
that
the
little
man
was
trying
to
trick
him
i
have
been
watching
you
since
lucera
my
lord
erculio
went
on
you
have
done
well
even
if
it
has
been
god
will
that
you
should
not
succeed
you
have
been
clever
but
you
should
have
taken
the
tawidh
off
before
you
surrendered
do
you
think
there
are
no
christians
who
can
recognize
arabic
numerals
now
daoud
was
sure
the
little
man
was
an
ally
of
some
sort
in
arabic
he
said
does
the
scar
on
the
back
of
my
leg
look
fresh
it
has
healed
so
completely
that
no
one
would
believe
you
got
it
a
few
months
ago
they
know
nothing
of
our
islamic
medicine
you
bear
another
wound
though
that
would
have
much
to
say
to
the
observant
your
circumcision
that
was
why
i
had
them
put
a
loincloth
on
you
and
lay
you
facedown
on
this
rack
lucky
for
me
you
were
here
daoud
said
not
luck
said
erculio
el
malik
deemed
it
wise
that
should
you
be
made
a
prisoner
one
of
his
men
ought
to
be
among
your
captors
here
baibars
hand
reaches
out
to
thought
daoud
feeling
a
rush
of
gratitude
help
me
to
escape
said
daoud
the
guards
and
the
clerk
are
asleep
erculio
brought
his
small
hand
downward
in
a
gesture
of
flat
rejection
there
are
a
hundred
on
duty
up
above
the
podesta
himself
will
be
down
here
in
an
hour
why
can
you
not
make
up
a
story
that
will
satisfy
him
say
you
are
a
ghibellino
that
is
what
he
believes
and
since
it
is
not
true
it
will
not
help
him
in
a
thousand
years
he
would
never
guess
the
truth
no
the
only
way
i
can
protect
those
close
to
me
is
to
admit
nothing
erculio
shook
his
head
and
his
black
eyes
were
liquid
with
sadness
what
a
pity
your
case
is
hopeless
then
ever
since
i
saw
you
in
lucera
i
have
felt
sorry
for
you
how
can
el
malik
expect
one
man
to
change
the
course
of
nations
you
are
like
a
man
trying
to
hold
apart
two
ships
about
to
collide
he
sighed
i
have
done
all
i
can
for
you
i
have
hurt
you
as
much
as
i
can
without
doing
you
permanent
injury
so
far
there
is
only
one
other
service
i
can
perform
for
you
what
is
that
said
daoud
though
he
felt
sure
he
already
knew
the
answer
you
would
not
want
to
reveal
under
torture
that
you
are
an
agent
of
the
sultan
of
el
kahira
and
provoke
the
very
crusade
you
were
sent
here
to
prevent
you
would
not
want
to
give
your
friends
away
if
you
break
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
die
before
you
might
speak
i
will
not
break
said
daoud
and
when
it
is
all
over
and
has
killed
me
he
will
at
last
come
to
believe
that
i
was
telling
the
truth
because
he
believes
that
no
one
can
hold
out
against
torture
to
the
very
end
but
promise
me
one
thing
anything
if
you
must
cripple
me
see
that
i
do
not
leave
this
dungeon
alive
understanding
and
respect
glowed
in
the
black
eyes
peering
at
daoud
over
the
edge
of
the
rack
as
you
wish
my
lord
he
knew
he
should
be
grateful
that
he
had
this
man
here
to
guarantee
him
a
decent
death
but
a
great
sadness
came
over
him
at
the
thought
that
his
life
must
end
miserably
in
this
dungeon
he
had
always
hoped
that
he
would
meet
his
fate
amid
the
glory
of
jihad
holy
war
this
is
jihad
of
a
the
respite
was
over
erculio
fell
upon
daoud
with
renewed
vigor
driving
needles
under
his
toenails
and
fingernails
and
beating
him
with
a
whip
of
knotted
rawhide
cords
that
tore
open
his
back
daoud
felt
the
blood
running
down
his
sides
and
pooling
underneath
him
the
little
man
took
a
poker
and
pressed
it
hissing
against
the
scar
made
by
the
tartar
arrow
and
lorenzo
knife
that
daoud
realized
would
make
it
impossible
to
tell
what
sort
of
wound
it
had
been
the
pain
seemed
to
be
happening
to
someone
miles
away
as
daoud
converted
it
to
ripples
of
light
passing
through
his
body
he
understood
that
erculio
was
applying
tortures
whose
effects
could
be
seen
the
podesta
would
be
satisfied
that
erculio
had
done
his
work
well
daoud
did
his
part
too
the
rest
had
restored
his
strength
and
now
daoud
screamed
so
loudly
he
woke
the
guards
and
the
clerk
erculio
set
the
guards
to
work
replacing
the
candles
in
the
sconces
around
the
dungeon
when
daoud
turned
his
throbbing
head
to
look
at
the
candles
he
saw
hazy
rings
around
them
and
rays
radiating
from
them
sweat
stung
his
eyes
the
thick
wooden
door
of
the
cellar
swung
inward
and
entered
he
walked
over
to
where
daoud
lay
on
the
rack
and
stood
staring
at
him
with
his
peculiar
glazed
expression
face
was
more
sour
than
usual
and
his
eyelids
were
puffed
he
looked
just
awakened
from
a
sleep
that
had
given
him
little
refreshment
his
mouth
twitched
under
the
thin
mustache
daoud
noticed
that
in
one
hand
held
a
small
silver
flask
with
a
narrow
neck
and
a
glass
stopper
clenched
his
hand
around
it
tightly
as
if
he
feared
to
drop
it
what
has
he
said
he
demanded
turning
to
erculio
just
much
screaming
signore
erculio
looked
across
the
room
at
the
bearded
clerk
who
nodded
vigorously
you
have
not
hurt
him
enough
then
erculio
said
the
podesta
he
should
be
offering
us
by
now
to
withstand
torture
for
so
long
almost
smacks
of
sorcery
perhaps
he
really
has
nothing
to
tell
erculio
ventured
nonsense
glared
at
the
dwarf
even
an
innocent
man
would
make
the
torture
stop
if
he
had
to
lie
to
do
it
and
this
man
is
not
innocent
that
one
remark
erculio
risks
much
for
thought
daoud
praying
the
little
man
would
not
again
endanger
himself
attenzione
said
coming
close
to
daoud
head
and
holding
the
flask
so
daoud
could
see
it
he
withdrew
the
stopper
a
long
icicle
of
glass
he
held
the
flask
low
over
the
rack
table
and
tilted
it
momentarily
a
few
drops
of
dark
brown
liquid
splashed
onto
the
wood
at
once
righted
and
stopped
the
flask
a
white
flash
bright
as
lightning
burst
before
daoud
face
blinding
him
he
jerked
his
head
back
and
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
he
heard
erculio
curse
in
italian
and
the
clerk
and
the
guards
cry
out
smoke
burned
daoud
nostrils
and
throat
as
he
coughed
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
a
small
fire
burning
its
way
into
the
wood
a
hand
breadth
from
his
face
he
felt
a
wave
of
heat
and
his
men
watched
in
silence
as
the
fire
ate
through
the
thick
planking
of
the
rack
table
gradually
the
blaze
lost
its
intensity
as
the
liquid
that
started
it
was
used
up
it
ended
in
a
hole
a
man
could
pass
his
fist
through
with
glowing
smoking
edges
what
that
said
the
clerk
tugging
nervously
at
his
brown
beard
witchcraft
said
with
a
grim
chuckle
the
clerk
and
the
guards
stared
at
him
erculio
was
expressionless
in
spite
of
soma
in
spite
of
his
years
of
training
daoud
felt
a
scream
of
horror
rising
inside
him
at
the
thought
of
what
was
threatening
not
witchcraft
but
just
as
evil
went
on
it
is
a
weapon
devised
by
the
byzantines
ah
said
the
clerk
this
must
be
that
greek
fire
i
have
heard
crusaders
tell
of
i
always
thought
it
another
of
their
lies
about
the
east
it
is
real
said
perhaps
our
guest
being
from
the
east
has
seen
it
before
the
turks
stole
the
secret
from
the
byzantines
and
have
been
using
it
against
the
crusaders
it
starts
burning
the
moment
it
is
exposed
to
air
it
clings
to
whatever
it
touches
and
its
flames
can
not
be
put
out
maligno
the
podesta
turned
to
daoud
but
in
this
case
we
will
be
using
it
for
a
good
purpose
messer
david
do
you
love
your
organs
of
manhood
what
are
you
saying
to
me
daoud
cried
determined
that
he
would
be
david
of
trebizond
to
the
very
end
his
real
terror
now
matched
his
pretended
terror
but
he
managed
to
keep
them
two
separate
feelings
the
scream
trying
to
escape
him
battered
itself
like
a
trapped
animal
against
the
inner
wall
of
the
face
of
steel
bent
closer
to
daoud
and
from
his
painful
position
belly
down
arms
and
legs
stretched
taut
daoud
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
the
podesta
glowered
at
him
his
lips
tight
under
his
thin
mustache
i
mean
that
if
you
do
not
tell
me
who
you
really
are
and
what
you
are
doing
in
orvieto
i
will
apply
this
healing
potion
to
your
male
member
it
should
not
take
more
than
a
drop
to
burn
away
everything
you
have
there
feinted
at
daoud
face
with
the
flask
and
daoud
flinched
back
and
cried
out
he
strained
desperately
against
the
chains
that
held
him
greek
fire
what
a
cruel
turn
of
fate
that
a
thing
invented
by
people
should
destroy
him
grief
swelled
in
his
throat
as
he
mourned
the
end
of
those
hours
of
delight
they
had
passed
together
but
daoud
thought
did
not
need
greek
fire
to
destroy
his
manhood
he
could
burn
it
with
oil
and
a
torch
or
he
could
order
erculio
to
slash
it
away
with
a
knife
the
podesta
had
chosen
greek
fire
because
it
was
strange
hinted
of
magic
maligno
daoud
remembered
what
had
said
an
eon
ago
when
they
were
talking
upstairs
that
he
would
prefer
picking
a
lock
to
forcing
it
even
now
the
podesta
was
trying
to
use
fear
rather
than
pain
to
make
daoud
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
himself
did
not
really
relish
inflicting
physical
pain
he
preferred
to
work
on
men
emotions
peered
at
him
under
the
appearance
of
a
helpless
and
terrified
merchant
there
is
bravado
but
now
you
know
what
a
terrible
thing
is
going
to
happen
to
you
if
you
persist
i
will
give
that
understanding
time
to
ripen
he
drew
away
and
turned
to
erculio
i
will
return
at
midday
after
my
morning
audiences
see
that
he
thinks
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
him
erculio
bowed
signore
the
podesta
left
the
dungeon
still
holding
the
silver
flask
has
to
put
off
carrying
out
his
daoud
thought
he
has
poured
that
greek
fire
on
my
loins
he
has
done
his
worst
if
the
fear
does
not
force
me
to
speak
the
deed
is
pointless
after
it
is
done
i
will
have
little
more
to
lose
if
he
were
a
true
torturer
he
would
have
begun
with
my
even
so
daoud
was
sure
would
carry
out
his
threat
i
must
prepare
myself
for
if
used
the
greek
fire
on
him
daoud
would
want
erculio
to
kill
him
and
he
was
sure
erculio
would
do
it
he
turned
his
mind
again
to
thoughts
of
god
soon
he
would
be
with
god
in
paradise
he
heard
erculio
talking
to
the
guards
making
preparations
for
some
new
torment
rather
than
wallow
in
fear
daoud
visualized
a
fresh
flood
of
soma
coursing
through
his
heart
and
mind
and
limbs
saadi
had
explained
that
there
was
no
limit
to
how
much
of
a
spiritual
drug
a
man
could
take
this
time
as
soma
detached
his
spirit
from
his
body
something
happened
to
him
unlike
anything
he
had
never
known
before
he
was
looking
down
at
himself
he
saw
himself
lying
facedown
nearly
nude
on
the
rack
his
blond
hair
darkened
and
plastered
down
with
sweat
he
saw
the
bloody
slashes
across
his
back
the
blackened
burn
mark
on
his
leg
he
was
floating
near
the
ceiling
of
the
dungeon
he
looked
down
at
the
spider
shape
of
erculio
talking
with
the
guards
and
the
clerk
amazing
that
they
did
not
look
up
here
and
see
him
they
thought
he
was
still
on
the
rack
he
rose
through
solid
stone
a
space
of
lightlessness
then
he
was
moving
over
tiled
floors
through
the
upper
levels
of
the
palazzo
del
podesta
and
he
was
out
through
its
oak
door
the
vault
of
the
sky
over
him
was
as
black
and
heavy
as
the
stones
of
the
dungeon
where
his
body
lay
it
must
be
the
final
hour
of
night
even
though
he
was
a
spirit
he
sensed
that
the
air
was
hot
and
damp
he
rose
higher
and
higher
over
orvieto
and
amazingly
he
was
able
to
see
despite
the
absence
of
light
he
could
see
the
entire
oval
shape
of
the
city
from
end
to
end
and
the
deep
valleys
that
surrounded
it
there
at
the
west
end
was
the
cathedral
of
san
giovenale
with
the
great
piazza
where
public
events
took
place
there
was
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
near
the
palace
where
the
pope
had
lived
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
where
he
had
hoped
to
end
the
threat
to
islam
with
swift
blows
of
his
dagger
and
there
from
such
a
height
and
since
it
was
not
yet
dawn
he
should
not
have
been
able
to
recognize
her
but
he
saw
and
knew
at
once
the
small
figure
of
a
cloaked
and
hooded
woman
striding
purposefully
through
a
twisting
street
she
was
walking
through
the
eastern
side
of
the
town
in
the
direction
of
tilia
house
which
he
could
see
from
up
here
with
the
dovecote
on
its
roof
and
its
crenellated
balconies
though
sophia
could
not
beside
sophia
a
hulking
figure
carried
a
torch
to
light
their
way
ugolini
riccardo
without
knowing
how
he
did
it
daoud
was
down
from
the
sky
in
an
instant
and
walking
invisibly
beside
her
her
black
brows
were
drawn
together
in
a
frown
her
nose
and
mouth
covered
by
a
silk
scarf
she
looked
almost
like
a
muslim
woman
she
was
full
of
fear
for
him
he
knew
he
wanted
to
tell
her
not
to
be
afraid
but
how
could
he
knowing
he
was
going
to
die
he
thanked
god
for
letting
him
see
sophia
one
last
time
love
you
sophia
remember
our
lii
fighting
billows
of
terror
that
threatened
to
engulf
her
sophia
pulled
her
veil
aside
so
that
tilia
servant
cassio
could
recognize
her
yawning
cassio
led
sophia
and
riccardo
into
the
large
reception
room
and
left
them
ugolini
man
threw
himself
down
on
a
padded
bench
sophia
too
agitated
to
sit
still
unpinned
her
hooded
cloak
and
dropped
it
beside
riccardo
even
though
she
had
just
walked
halfway
across
town
she
paced
the
carpeted
floor
twisting
her
fingers
would
tilia
be
able
to
help
or
would
she
be
as
powerless
as
ugolini
this
journey
across
the
city
might
be
utterly
futile
but
sophia
unable
to
sleep
and
tormented
by
visions
of
what
was
happening
to
daoud
had
to
do
something
tilia
quickly
appeared
on
the
landing
of
the
second
floor
gallery
followed
by
cassio
who
held
a
candle
despite
her
bulk
she
seemed
to
flow
down
the
stairs
in
her
trailing
red
silk
gown
quickly
tell
me
what
has
happened
she
said
for
you
to
come
this
late
it
must
be
disastroso
her
voice
was
calm
but
hoarse
her
face
was
puffy
and
creased
with
deep
wrinkles
she
wore
one
piece
of
jewelry
her
bishop
cross
we
had
better
talk
alone
sophia
said
tilia
nodded
riccardo
was
already
sitting
on
a
couch
in
the
entry
hall
with
his
eyes
shut
cassio
looked
inquiringly
at
tilia
his
black
hair
usually
and
glossy
was
a
nest
of
unruly
locks
pointing
every
which
way
give
me
the
candle
cassio
said
tilia
come
up
to
my
room
sophia
your
escort
can
wait
here
she
sighed
a
few
weeks
ago
there
would
have
been
clients
waiting
in
this
room
even
at
this
hour
since
the
pope
left
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
emptiness
of
the
great
chamber
sophia
felt
herself
wanting
to
cling
to
tilia
as
if
the
short
fat
woman
were
her
mother
a
few
months
before
she
had
felt
nothing
but
hatred
for
the
brothel
keeper
because
she
had
introduced
rachel
into
whoredom
now
she
prayed
only
that
tilia
could
help
her
her
bedroom
was
cool
the
shutters
of
a
large
double
window
having
been
swung
open
to
let
in
the
night
air
tilia
sat
on
her
wide
bed
which
was
covered
with
embroidered
cushions
and
silk
sheets
that
draped
over
the
four
posts
sophia
went
to
the
window
and
drew
back
the
curtain
to
look
out
the
street
outside
was
dark
and
empty
what
was
happening
to
daoud
in
the
palazzo
del
podesta
were
they
crippling
his
beautiful
body
was
he
dying
dead
she
felt
like
crying
at
the
thought
of
how
they
might
be
hurting
him
but
she
could
not
help
him
unless
she
kept
her
head
sophia
quickly
told
tilia
about
daoud
arrest
tilia
lay
back
on
the
bed
her
beady
eyes
fixed
on
sophia
and
fingered
the
cross
on
her
ample
bosom
every
so
often
she
nodded
as
if
this
were
just
what
she
had
expected
she
covered
her
eyes
momentarily
with
her
hand
may
god
be
kind
to
daoud
ibn
abdallah
he
is
worth
ten
of
any
ordinary
men
knows
daoud
muslim
name
but
sophia
had
no
time
to
pursue
the
thought
tilia
had
quickly
wiped
her
tears
away
and
turned
to
sophia
expectantly
with
lorenzo
away
you
are
the
only
one
who
might
be
able
to
do
something
sophia
said
what
do
you
expect
of
me
if
david
lets
himself
be
taken
away
and
the
cardinal
does
nothing
tilia
asked
have
i
more
power
than
they
clearly
her
use
of
daoud
was
a
momentary
indiscretion
we
need
someone
who
can
think
sophia
said
realizing
how
vague
she
sounded
in
her
desperation
how
is
adelberto
taking
it
tilia
asked
he
is
almost
speechless
with
terror
he
just
moans
and
weeps
and
wrings
his
hands
i
am
afraid
he
may
try
to
run
away
or
confess
everything
or
do
something
equally
foolish
tilia
nodded
again
grimly
he
is
picturing
all
the
things
they
will
do
to
him
if
he
is
found
guilty
of
conspiring
with
the
enemies
of
christendom
she
looked
at
sophia
keenly
what
about
you
are
you
not
afraid
for
yourself
i
am
dying
of
fear
tilia
reached
over
and
squeezed
her
hand
i
am
frightened
too
who
would
not
be
but
you
right
giving
way
to
panic
just
leaves
us
helpless
let
us
go
back
to
adelberto
mansion
he
is
a
changeable
man
i
may
be
able
to
get
him
to
think
sensibly
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
with
him
a
wave
of
relief
swept
over
sophia
at
least
she
was
no
longer
struggling
alone
sophia
could
see
a
bluish
light
on
the
tile
roofs
of
the
houses
across
from
tilia
window
it
would
soon
be
morning
they
have
had
daoud
for
a
whole
night
what
have
they
done
to
him
has
men
watching
the
cardinal
mansion
sophia
said
riccardo
and
i
slipped
out
through
the
tunnel
that
leads
under
the
street
to
the
potterymaker
shop
but
we
can
not
get
back
in
that
way
getting
there
is
the
easiest
part
of
it
said
tilia
cassio
will
hire
a
covered
cart
for
us
the
hard
part
will
be
deciding
what
to
do
once
we
have
arrived
she
smiled
and
patted
her
breasts
accentuated
by
the
gossamer
fabric
of
her
sleeping
gown
i
must
put
some
clothes
on
while
you
dress
can
i
see
rachel
sophia
asked
she
noticed
three
ironbound
chests
ornamented
with
circular
enameled
medallions
standing
in
a
row
against
the
wall
beside
tilia
bed
each
was
secured
with
a
padlock
they
must
hold
the
gold
tilia
customers
brought
to
her
i
will
take
you
to
rachel
said
tilia
she
is
as
well
and
happy
as
when
you
saw
her
last
but
do
not
tell
her
what
has
happened
to
david
there
is
no
point
in
frightening
her
sophia
agreed
but
when
we
leave
orvieto
i
want
to
take
her
with
us
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
i
am
looking
after
her
welfare
tilia
said
just
yesterday
john
the
tartar
offered
me
five
thousand
florins
to
let
him
take
her
to
perugia
with
him
when
he
follows
the
pope
there
he
flew
into
a
rage
when
i
refused
him
so
you
see
i
have
even
braved
the
fury
of
the
tartars
for
rachel
sake
perhaps
you
will
begin
to
judge
me
a
little
more
kindly
turning
to
leave
the
room
sophia
froze
momentarily
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
tilia
would
know
that
she
had
once
hated
her
the
woman
penetrating
she
felt
a
little
more
confident
that
tilia
would
have
the
wisdom
to
help
her
in
this
calamity
tilia
holding
a
candle
opened
rachel
door
for
sophia
more
glittering
gold
had
been
added
to
the
girl
bedroom
since
sophia
had
last
visited
her
and
when
the
candle
flame
illuminated
it
the
room
seemed
to
blaze
sophia
blinked
at
the
gold
curtains
before
the
windows
and
the
heavy
draperies
surrounding
the
bed
all
this
she
thought
was
to
impress
that
horrible
tartar
who
came
here
to
lie
with
rachel
how
lucky
sophia
had
been
to
be
able
to
share
her
bed
with
a
man
she
loved
but
thoughts
of
happiness
with
daoud
memories
were
like
a
knife
in
her
heart
now
that
he
had
been
taken
from
her
tilia
pulled
the
drape
aside
and
there
was
rachel
curled
up
nude
on
top
of
yellow
silk
sheets
her
skinny
arms
and
legs
made
her
look
even
younger
than
she
was
sophia
felt
heartsick
as
rachel
eyes
opened
wide
at
the
sudden
light
she
sat
up
in
bed
dragging
the
sheet
across
her
body
then
drew
back
against
the
wall
she
looked
terrified
sophia
wondered
what
sort
of
awakenings
rachel
was
used
to
in
this
place
and
a
sudden
return
of
her
rage
at
tilia
made
her
tremble
and
happy
is
she
but
she
dared
not
be
angry
with
tilia
now
tilia
was
the
only
person
who
could
help
her
rachel
black
eyes
fell
on
sophia
and
the
fear
went
out
of
her
face
it
was
replaced
by
a
glad
smile
that
hurt
sophia
heart
all
the
more
abandoned
her
to
this
and
yet
she
is
happy
to
see
i
will
leave
you
two
to
talk
tilia
said
sophia
sat
on
the
gold
sheets
and
took
rachel
hand
when
tilia
was
gone
for
a
moment
she
forgot
her
own
grief
and
fear
as
an
urge
to
comfort
rachel
pushed
to
the
fore
all
of
us
are
going
to
be
leaving
orvieto
soon
and
when
we
do
we
will
take
you
with
us
she
said
rachel
dark
eyes
glowed
sophia
went
on
wherever
we
go
you
will
not
have
to
stay
with
tilia
anymore
and
do
what
tilia
expects
of
you
we
will
find
a
home
for
you
she
was
not
sure
how
she
was
going
to
keep
such
a
promise
but
she
decided
that
daoud
would
have
to
kill
her
before
she
would
let
him
put
rachel
in
another
brothel
again
the
knife
in
her
breast
as
she
remembered
she
might
never
see
daoud
again
rachel
shrugged
i
may
be
better
off
doing
this
than
i
would
be
as
some
man
wife
she
looked
down
at
her
hands
and
sophia
saw
that
her
fingers
were
long
and
slender
and
quite
beautiful
john
chagan
has
made
me
very
rich
you
know
sophia
thought
of
the
three
locked
chests
in
tilia
room
she
would
have
to
make
sure
that
rachel
when
she
left
this
place
of
shame
got
all
the
gold
that
was
rightfully
hers
and
how
outrageous
that
tilia
had
been
filling
rachel
head
with
lies
about
how
lucky
she
was
tilia
and
the
others
here
have
to
believe
that
this
is
the
right
life
for
them
but
there
is
not
a
woman
here
who
would
not
trade
whatever
riches
she
has
earned
for
a
real
home
with
a
husband
and
children
rachel
was
silent
a
moment
her
face
was
all
straight
lines
sophia
saw
yet
delicate
and
feminine
at
the
same
time
a
woman
she
will
be
much
more
beautiful
than
even
you
rachel
said
suddenly
sophia
was
surprised
we
are
not
talking
about
me
i
am
not
a
courtesan
what
are
you
rachel
asked
softly
shyly
word
is
there
to
describe
me
she
had
thought
often
about
other
women
and
how
different
their
lives
were
from
hers
sometimes
to
survive
she
had
to
give
her
body
to
men
when
she
did
not
want
to
she
had
been
in
danger
of
death
she
had
known
love
and
wealth
and
power
she
had
lived
this
way
since
her
parents
and
the
boy
she
had
loved
were
killed
and
she
could
not
imagine
living
any
other
way
i
am
just
a
person
who
does
whatever
she
needs
to
said
sophia
how
could
she
sit
here
and
talk
like
this
when
daoud
might
be
dying
a
chill
went
over
her
as
if
she
were
in
the
grip
of
a
fever
and
she
almost
cried
aloud
something
is
wrong
rachel
said
why
are
you
here
so
early
in
the
morning
that
look
of
terror
was
coming
back
into
her
face
the
door
opened
and
tilia
was
there
dressed
in
a
long
green
silk
tunic
and
a
yellow
satin
surcoat
light
was
beginning
to
show
through
windows
sophia
held
rachel
hand
for
a
moment
and
then
let
go
of
it
and
stood
up
to
leave
take
me
with
you
rachel
said
seizing
sophia
wrist
not
now
said
sophia
quickly
we
will
all
be
together
when
we
leave
orvieto
rachel
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
i
do
not
want
to
stay
here
i
want
to
go
with
you
now
what
have
you
been
saying
to
her
tilia
said
angrily
nothing
said
sophia
she
turned
to
rachel
see
madama
will
be
angry
with
me
she
thinks
i
have
been
frightening
you
now
show
her
that
you
are
calm
and
are
willing
to
stay
here
rachel
thin
shoulders
slumped
as
you
wish
signora
in
the
midst
of
her
fear
for
daoud
a
pang
of
guilt
shot
through
sophia
she
had
upset
rachel
and
then
spoken
gruffly
to
her
she
rushed
to
her
and
hugged
the
thin
body
against
hers
she
kissed
rachel
quickly
and
followed
tilia
out
sophia
followed
tilia
through
the
door
of
ugolini
cabinet
after
tilia
thrust
it
open
without
even
knocking
ugolini
eyes
bulged
at
the
sight
of
tilia
and
he
threw
down
his
pen
he
was
still
in
a
panic
sophia
saw
heartsick
even
if
they
could
come
up
with
a
plan
to
rescue
daoud
would
he
be
willing
to
do
anything
now
of
all
times
you
should
not
be
here
he
cried
at
tilia
without
a
word
tilia
marched
across
the
syrian
carpet
her
broad
hips
swinging
under
her
green
gown
she
went
around
ugolini
desk
and
held
out
her
arms
to
him
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
glance
at
sophia
he
stood
up
he
was
the
same
height
as
tilia
and
let
her
take
him
into
her
arms
he
leaned
his
head
on
her
shoulder
for
a
moment
then
handed
her
into
his
chair
really
are
thought
sophia
seeing
the
little
sudden
wistful
smile
the
sight
of
that
smile
gave
her
new
hope
perhaps
tilia
could
restore
his
courage
only
ugolini
had
the
power
and
authority
to
do
anything
about
daoud
imprisonment
tilia
had
to
bring
him
back
to
himself
did
you
not
want
me
to
know
adelberto
what
happened
to
david
she
demanded
looking
down
at
the
parchment
he
had
been
writing
on
what
is
this
i
am
calculating
my
horoscope
for
this
day
the
stars
are
telling
me
i
have
overreached
myself
and
have
only
myself
to
blame
for
my
downfall
for
your
downfall
dear
god
adelberto
have
you
given
up
hope
already
his
words
dimmed
sophia
hopes
he
believed
in
his
stars
ugolini
dressed
in
a
white
gown
tied
at
the
waist
with
a
cord
walked
to
the
windows
and
pulled
the
violet
drapes
across
them
darkening
the
room
a
breeze
made
the
drapes
billow
inward
and
blew
out
the
flame
of
the
candle
on
his
desk
plunging
the
room
into
a
deeper
darkness
unbidden
sophia
picked
up
a
wax
taper
from
worktable
igniting
it
from
the
fat
candle
in
the
corner
away
from
the
window
and
went
lighting
candles
in
the
candelabra
around
the
room
talking
in
the
dark
would
only
drive
their
spirits
lower
only
lorenzo
were
here
he
would
have
a
plan
by
now
and
be
doing
something
about
ugolini
held
out
his
hands
to
tilia
i
am
doomed
and
i
do
not
want
you
dragged
down
with
me
he
turned
to
sophia
whiskers
bristling
over
his
grimace
you
should
have
left
her
out
of
this
i
had
left
her
out
of
it
there
would
be
no
hope
at
sophia
thought
sitting
on
the
small
chair
facing
ugolini
worktable
she
looked
with
appeal
at
tilia
who
nodded
reassuringly
tilia
needs
just
as
much
as
any
of
us
to
know
what
is
happening
said
sophia
and
you
need
to
talk
to
her
ugolini
hands
were
trembling
she
saw
she
too
was
afraid
both
for
herself
and
daoud
fear
was
a
black
hollow
eating
away
at
her
insides
daoud
what
are
they
doing
to
you
he
might
come
out
of
the
palazzo
del
podesta
blind
or
with
arms
or
legs
cut
off
or
mad
she
thought
when
she
saw
him
again
she
might
wish
him
dead
and
herself
along
with
him
she
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
her
brow
with
the
hem
of
her
silk
cloak
in
the
heavy
hot
air
the
scent
of
tilia
sachet
filled
the
room
only
a
miracle
can
save
us
said
ugolini
pacing
and
waving
his
hands
i
have
been
praying
to
god
that
he
take
the
soul
of
david
of
trebizond
before
he
breaks
under
torture
and
dooms
us
all
sophia
reeled
with
the
pain
his
words
brought
her
she
wanted
to
claw
ugolini
eyes
out
she
sprang
up
from
her
chair
fists
clenched
may
god
take
soul
she
screamed
at
him
and
send
you
straight
to
hell
ugolini
turned
and
stared
at
her
as
if
she
had
struck
him
be
still
sophia
said
tilia
quietly
that
will
not
help
panting
heavily
sophia
sat
down
again
they
needed
ugolini
so
badly
and
he
was
so
she
wanted
to
weep
with
frustration
of
course
god
will
damn
me
ugolini
cried
throwing
his
arms
into
the
air
as
he
paced
the
room
his
white
gown
rippling
why
should
he
spare
me
or
any
of
us
when
we
have
been
working
against
his
church
is
not
my
thought
sophia
resentfully
is
the
schismatic
latin
church
he
speaks
remembering
that
she
was
probably
the
only
person
of
her
faith
in
orvieto
she
felt
terribly
alone
as
alone
as
daoud
must
it
seems
that
you
no
longer
know
who
you
are
said
tilia
sourly
to
ugolini
eh
what
do
you
mean
he
turned
quickly
and
peered
at
her
talks
to
him
as
if
she
were
his
sophia
thought
that
is
what
he
you
are
one
of
men
who
the
church
said
tilia
firmly
you
will
elect
the
next
pope
and
very
soon
by
all
signs
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
orvieto
subject
to
this
podesta
she
spat
the
word
you
are
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
italy
i
am
the
creature
of
the
sultan
of
egypt
and
soon
the
whole
world
will
know
it
ugolini
moaned
oh
god
how
i
wish
you
had
never
come
to
me
with
his
bribes
so
it
was
tilia
who
had
recruited
ugolini
for
this
work
there
were
depths
to
this
woman
if
anyone
could
have
an
effect
on
ugolini
now
she
could
but
sophia
wondered
if
even
tilia
could
reach
the
cardinal
in
his
present
state
are
you
sorry
you
met
me
adelberto
said
tilia
softly
no
no
said
ugolini
hastily
he
rushed
over
to
where
she
sat
at
his
table
and
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
without
you
he
said
earnestly
my
life
would
have
been
flat
and
empty
thought
sophia
loves
her
that
might
make
the
and
i
helped
you
become
wealthier
than
you
ever
dreamed
possible
i
helped
you
buy
the
red
hat
true
said
ugolini
but
fortune
raises
men
high
only
so
they
may
fall
farther
when
she
casts
them
down
tilia
brought
her
large
hand
down
hard
on
ugolini
table
enough
of
this
talk
of
the
stars
and
fortune
look
here
adelberto
for
this
little
cimice
this
bedbug
of
a
man
to
walk
into
the
house
of
cardinal
ugolini
and
arrest
one
of
his
guests
it
is
insufferable
you
must
not
permit
it
sophia
did
not
dare
to
breathe
as
she
watched
ugolini
face
for
a
sign
of
returning
strength
no
doubt
you
are
right
said
ugolini
nodding
slowly
like
a
boy
being
taught
his
lessons
you
must
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
this
man
tilia
went
on
with
most
of
the
cardinals
following
the
pope
to
perugia
you
are
now
even
more
important
in
orvieto
god
for
at
this
moment
sophia
was
willing
to
forgive
tilia
even
the
corrupting
of
rachel
ugolini
said
yes
but
if
last
night
i
could
not
stop
him
from
taking
david
what
can
i
do
now
he
spread
his
empty
hands
another
gust
of
wind
lifted
the
purple
drapes
and
sent
scraps
of
parchment
from
ugolini
table
to
the
carpet
sophia
saw
circles
and
triangles
and
whole
constellations
flying
across
the
room
they
would
have
to
enlist
the
aid
of
someone
who
had
influence
over
the
podesta
sophia
thought
someone
who
was
friendly
enough
to
ugolini
to
be
willing
to
speak
on
his
behalf
with
the
pope
gone
the
most
powerful
person
in
the
city
was
as
soon
as
the
thought
came
to
her
she
spoke
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
cardinal
you
must
go
to
her
and
ask
her
help
her
heart
rose
to
her
throat
choking
her
tilia
and
ugolini
stared
at
her
would
they
listen
would
they
spurn
her
idea
why
should
help
me
said
ugolini
she
admires
you
said
sophia
she
told
me
so
the
night
of
the
reception
she
gave
for
the
tartars
now
that
the
pope
has
left
orvieto
she
probably
feels
neglected
ugolini
shook
his
head
but
david
is
accused
of
involvement
in
the
attack
on
her
palace
just
yesterday
i
saw
her
cackling
like
a
strega
while
her
men
chopped
off
marco
di
filippeschi
head
and
murdered
half
his
family
they
even
impaled
a
baby
on
a
spear
and
she
shouted
with
glee
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
said
sophia
though
the
image
revolted
her
she
has
no
reason
to
connect
david
with
the
filippeschi
tilia
nodded
vigorously
shaking
her
body
and
the
chair
she
was
sitting
in
sophia
has
an
excellent
idea
adelberto
if
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
pleads
for
david
if
the
injured
party
is
convinced
of
his
innocence
the
podesta
must
yield
sophia
felt
more
confident
as
she
saw
that
tilia
was
on
her
side
she
pressed
the
attack
again
and
again
has
shown
that
he
does
whatever
the
monaldeschi
expect
of
him
she
urged
he
used
to
do
whatever
family
expected
of
him
said
ugolini
until
so
many
filippeschi
perished
that
they
ceased
to
matter
ugolini
went
to
the
window
a
blast
of
hot
damp
wind
roared
into
the
room
and
he
raised
his
hand
protectively
in
front
of
his
face
it
will
storm
soon
said
tilia
it
can
not
be
soon
enough
to
suit
me
a
storm
will
break
this
terrible
heat
as
soon
as
the
storm
passes
you
must
go
to
her
ugolini
nodded
slowly
if
i
fail
to
convince
her
i
will
be
no
worse
off
than
i
am
now
you
will
convince
her
said
tilia
you
might
as
well
start
to
put
on
your
red
robes
real
hope
sailed
across
the
sea
of
terror
to
sophia
now
and
it
was
a
galley
a
galley
with
sails
painted
a
cardinal
red
she
felt
it
bearing
her
up
over
her
dread
for
daoud
and
for
herself
i
will
go
to
the
contessa
with
you
said
sophia
if
he
gave
way
to
panic
again
she
could
stop
him
from
doing
too
much
damage
and
i
will
return
to
my
house
said
tilia
standing
up
no
said
ugolini
it
was
dangerous
enough
for
you
to
come
here
we
know
this
mansion
is
being
watched
stay
here
until
nightfall
tilia
smiled
went
to
him
and
held
his
small
pointed
face
between
her
hands
i
will
stay
and
if
you
succeed
in
persuading
the
contessa
to
have
david
freed
we
will
have
something
to
celebrate
you
and
i
to
celebrate
what
a
wonderful
thought
sophia
had
begun
to
feel
she
would
never
celebrate
anything
again
but
moving
ugolini
to
act
was
only
the
first
step
she
reminded
herself
the
contessa
might
prove
to
be
against
them
and
daoud
might
still
be
doomed
sophia
watched
eaten
up
by
anxiety
as
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
advanced
slowly
into
her
smaller
audience
chamber
leaning
on
her
grandnephew
a
plump
boy
in
red
velvet
i
hope
you
have
not
come
to
scold
me
cardinal
ugolini
the
contessa
rasped
could
this
old
woman
really
have
laughed
to
see
a
baby
impaled
on
a
spear
sophia
wondered
as
she
and
ugolini
bowed
dear
contessa
scold
you
ugolini
said
with
a
chuckle
whatever
for
sophia
was
delighted
to
see
how
completely
he
had
to
all
outward
appearances
cast
off
the
terror
that
gripped
him
a
short
time
before
all
of
us
when
terror
strikes
he
needs
to
feel
he
can
do
ah
cardinal
surely
you
know
when
she
reached
ugolini
the
tall
bony
old
woman
clutched
at
the
boy
arm
with
both
clawlike
hands
and
began
with
an
effort
that
made
her
compress
her
withered
lips
to
lower
herself
to
the
floor
it
hurt
sophia
just
to
watch
her
struggle
to
genuflect
before
the
cardinal
the
contessa
had
aged
a
great
deal
sophia
thought
since
she
first
saw
her
over
a
year
ago
she
was
thinner
more
bent
moved
with
much
greater
difficulty
ugolini
reached
out
to
try
to
stop
her
from
kneeling
please
dona
elvira
he
cried
do
not
trouble
yourself
so
no
i
am
a
good
daughter
of
the
church
said
the
contessa
and
through
you
i
pay
homage
to
god
the
old
woman
maroon
satin
gown
crackled
as
she
bent
her
knees
even
kneeling
she
was
almost
as
tall
as
ugolini
gold
bracelets
rattled
around
her
skinny
arms
and
heavy
medallions
dangled
from
gold
chains
around
her
neck
a
net
of
gold
threads
held
the
coiled
braids
of
her
white
hair
in
place
once
she
was
on
her
knees
her
grandnephew
pulled
off
his
red
cap
and
bowed
to
ugolini
with
a
sweeping
gesture
his
hair
was
a
mass
of
tight
black
curls
had
he
too
watched
the
massacre
of
the
filippeschi
sophia
wondered
and
what
had
that
done
to
the
boy
please
let
me
kiss
your
ring
the
contessa
said
she
seized
his
hand
and
planted
a
loud
smacking
kiss
on
his
sapphire
cardinal
ring
it
is
i
who
should
pay
homage
to
you
dona
elvira
said
ugolini
sophia
immediately
stepped
forward
to
help
the
contessa
struggle
to
her
feet
the
boy
took
the
old
lady
from
the
other
side
sophia
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
looking
at
her
with
bright
amused
eyes
eyes
that
were
too
old
for
the
face
of
an
boy
when
she
got
close
to
the
contessa
sophia
smelled
an
odor
that
made
her
think
of
a
damp
cellar
together
sophia
and
the
monaldeschi
heir
walked
with
the
old
lady
to
a
chair
where
she
settled
herself
gasping
two
manservants
set
smaller
chairs
for
the
cardinal
and
sophia
facing
the
contessa
the
contessa
grandnephew
leaned
elegantly
against
the
back
of
the
old
lady
chair
the
fingers
of
his
chubby
hands
interlinked
sophia
glanced
at
him
and
caught
his
glittering
eyes
roving
over
her
body
he
saw
her
looking
at
him
and
smiled
faintly
and
without
embarrassment
contessa
elvira
raised
a
trembling
hand
cardinal
piacenza
had
been
most
unkind
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
condemning
me
in
the
rudest
terms
for
our
triumph
over
the
filippeschi
canaglia
yesterday
in
the
piazza
san
giovenale
he
accused
me
of
sacrilege
because
i
shed
the
blood
of
marco
during
a
mass
when
else
could
i
have
taken
him
and
his
foul
brood
unawares
god
gave
me
the
opportunity
nothing
happens
save
by
the
will
of
god
ugolini
murmured
esattamente
yet
cardinal
piacenza
has
the
audacity
to
tell
me
that
i
am
in
a
grave
state
of
sin
and
that
i
have
led
vittorio
here
into
sin
as
well
glancing
again
at
vittorio
sophia
noticed
the
sword
short
enough
for
a
boy
but
long
enough
to
kill
that
hung
from
his
jeweled
belt
ugolini
shook
his
head
no
one
has
the
right
to
say
that
another
is
in
sin
only
god
sees
the
soul
not
lest
ye
be
sophia
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
the
same
man
whose
panic
she
had
struggled
to
overcome
a
few
hours
earlier
he
was
suddenly
the
perfect
clergyman
attentive
sympathetic
sententious
yes
and
for
what
should
i
be
judged
the
contessa
lifted
both
hands
now
for
exacting
justice
if
you
have
any
doubts
dear
madama
ugolini
said
i
will
be
happy
to
give
you
absolution
that
was
a
nice
touch
thought
sophia
if
she
confessed
to
him
that
would
certainly
put
her
under
his
influence
but
even
as
they
talked
across
town
the
podesta
men
might
be
tearing
daoud
body
to
pieces
sophia
felt
her
stomach
knot
she
shook
her
head
as
vigorously
as
she
dared
to
drive
away
the
hideous
images
without
attracting
attention
to
herself
dear
god
make
them
hurry
i
no
doubts
said
the
old
lady
firmly
besides
i
have
my
own
chaplain
i
would
not
wish
another
person
on
earth
to
know
me
as
well
as
he
does
but
i
do
thank
you
for
your
kind
thought
cardinal
i
am
glad
to
see
that
not
all
the
princes
of
the
church
think
alike
in
this
matter
i
am
sure
cardinal
piacenza
is
quite
alone
said
ugolini
the
contessa
shrugged
i
do
not
know
about
that
since
his
holiness
left
no
one
has
called
on
me
i
have
been
feeling
quite
abandoned
now
sophia
began
to
feel
a
stronger
hope
than
ever
the
old
lady
liked
to
be
flattered
by
princes
of
the
church
perhaps
she
could
be
won
over
after
all
surely
your
guest
cardinal
de
verceuil
attends
you
often
ugolini
ventured
the
contessa
sniffed
that
frenchman
he
is
no
more
civilized
than
his
tartars
i
would
rather
he
left
me
alone
the
french
are
all
rather
barbaric
of
course
that
fine
young
simon
de
gobignon
he
is
most
attractive
she
grinned
with
a
lasciviousness
that
startled
sophia
this
palace
has
not
been
the
same
since
he
went
back
to
france
back
to
france
ugolini
stared
i
thought
he
too
was
going
to
perugia
sophia
felt
a
ball
of
ice
suddenly
encase
her
heart
she
had
told
ugolini
as
she
told
daoud
that
simon
was
going
to
perugia
she
prayed
ugolini
would
not
suspect
that
she
had
been
lying
oh
no
said
the
contessa
france
he
told
me
himself
when
he
took
leave
of
me
and
when
he
returns
i
think
ghibellini
everywhere
in
italy
will
have
reason
to
tremble
because
the
might
of
france
will
follow
him
i
am
only
sorry
he
will
not
come
in
time
to
save
orvieto
from
the
sienese
one
of
my
sergentes
just
reported
that
the
sienese
army
is
but
a
day
or
two
away
from
here
lorenzo
with
thought
sophia
only
he
would
what
will
you
do
contessa
ugolini
asked
as
a
guelfo
family
do
the
monaldeschi
intend
to
leave
orvieto
before
the
sienese
arrive
he
was
straying
from
the
subject
thought
sophia
impatiently
mind
the
damned
sienese
army
they
can
not
do
us
any
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
her
hooked
nose
jutting
defiantly
she
laid
her
hand
on
vittorio
we
will
stand
fast
this
family
has
lived
in
this
city
since
the
days
of
the
etruscans
i
expect
our
militia
to
put
up
a
good
fight
after
our
honor
has
been
satisfied
we
will
ask
with
dignity
for
terms
very
brave
said
ugolini
the
militia
of
orvieto
thought
sophia
was
under
the
command
of
the
podesta
if
was
involved
in
fighting
the
sienese
what
might
that
mean
for
daoud
dona
elvira
looked
at
the
cardinal
slyly
are
you
also
staying
in
orvieto
your
eminence
for
the
moment
said
ugolini
sophia
was
surprised
that
ugolini
did
not
say
more
but
the
conversation
seemed
to
be
going
the
way
he
wanted
it
to
you
may
be
able
to
help
us
your
eminence
sophia
felt
more
elated
than
ever
if
she
wanted
help
from
ugolini
then
surely
she
would
be
willing
to
help
him
nothing
would
please
me
more
contessa
you
are
from
the
south
from
manfred
kingdom
you
might
have
some
influence
with
these
ghibellini
perhaps
a
word
from
you
would
help
to
keep
our
house
and
our
property
intact
ugolini
threw
out
his
arms
dear
contessa
anything
of
course
as
a
loyal
supporter
of
the
pope
i
do
not
ordinarily
have
dealings
with
ghibellini
of
course
not
the
contessa
agreed
vittorio
smiled
he
had
a
small
chiseled
mouth
such
as
sophia
had
seen
on
the
men
in
ancient
roman
sculptures
but
whatever
little
i
might
be
able
to
do
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
ugolini
said
i
have
always
considered
you
my
very
good
friend
your
eminence
even
though
you
opposed
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
and
they
were
my
houseguests
that
startled
sophia
the
contessa
made
it
sound
as
if
the
tartars
had
left
her
home
your
houseguests
madama
ugolini
asked
so
he
had
noticed
it
too
she
sighed
yes
they
and
that
boorish
french
cardinal
left
for
perugia
this
morning
not
long
before
you
came
they
chose
a
bad
day
to
leave
this
morning
storm
is
not
the
end
of
the
rain
another
storm
is
coming
every
joint
in
my
body
aches
these
storms
clear
the
air
said
ugolini
the
contessa
held
up
a
sticklike
finger
exactly
as
the
storm
yesterday
in
the
piazza
san
giovenale
did
now
she
was
bringing
up
her
grievance
sophia
thought
evidently
she
had
offended
a
number
of
cardinals
with
the
massacre
of
the
filippeschi
a
servant
brought
a
small
table
of
some
shiny
black
wood
and
set
it
in
their
midst
its
legs
were
carved
in
the
form
of
twisting
wingless
dragons
perhaps
it
was
a
gift
to
the
contessa
from
the
tartars
sophia
had
seen
such
furnishings
in
constantinople
and
knew
they
came
from
the
distant
east
where
the
tartars
ruled
another
servant
brought
a
tray
with
small
sweet
cakes
filled
with
a
paste
made
of
crushed
white
raisins
a
third
poured
the
pale
yellow
wine
of
orvieto
into
silver
goblets
for
them
sophia
sipped
her
wine
but
her
stomach
churned
with
fear
for
daoud
a
fear
held
rigidly
in
check
she
could
not
drink
much
and
she
could
not
eat
at
all
every
so
often
she
glanced
at
vittorio
di
monaldeschi
and
each
time
she
did
she
found
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
ugolini
wiped
his
mouth
after
finishing
off
a
cake
as
fortune
wheel
turns
all
of
us
need
friends
at
one
time
or
another
how
true
said
the
old
lady
i
come
before
you
today
to
presume
upon
our
friendship
to
ask
you
a
favor
madama
said
ugolini
we
need
each
other
as
you
have
said
your
eminence
sophia
prayed
that
the
contessa
would
agree
to
help
ugolini
told
how
the
podesta
men
had
arrested
daoud
the
previous
night
sophia
watched
the
contessa
face
for
some
sign
of
sympathy
but
the
old
lady
remained
as
expressionless
as
a
bird
i
am
shocked
that
the
podesta
would
arrest
your
houseguest
she
said
but
what
can
i
do
after
all
signore
holds
the
office
because
he
has
our
confidence
means
that
he
stands
aside
while
you
murder
your
ugolini
spread
his
hands
precisely
because
he
has
your
confidence
dear
madonna
i
know
he
will
listen
to
you
we
have
had
no
word
of
what
has
become
of
our
guest
and
friend
i
want
punished
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
attack
on
my
palace
said
the
contessa
clenching
her
bony
fist
and
what
if
the
contessa
were
to
discover
that
the
man
they
were
talking
about
had
incited
that
attack
and
used
it
as
cover
for
his
own
attempt
to
murder
the
tartar
ambassadors
sophia
thought
she
would
want
him
torn
to
bits
in
the
piazza
new
waves
of
terror
washed
over
her
and
she
would
want
those
who
helped
him
punished
along
with
him
sophia
glanced
at
ugolini
and
saw
that
he
was
sweating
god
do
not
let
him
falter
of
course
contessa
he
said
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
you
because
you
and
not
the
podesta
are
the
one
truly
injured
but
the
arrest
of
david
is
a
terrible
mistake
i
place
before
you
my
belief
in
this
absolute
innocence
i
am
prepared
to
swear
to
it
he
was
not
even
here
in
orvieto
when
that
dastardly
attack
occurred
he
was
in
perugia
there
are
countless
witnesses
i
know
this
man
he
is
a
man
a
merchant
not
a
warrior
i
remember
him
said
the
contessa
a
very
blond
man
i
heard
his
conversation
with
the
tartars
and
i
began
to
wonder
myself
about
the
wisdom
of
allying
ourselves
with
them
it
is
probably
because
david
did
testify
against
the
tartars
that
the
podesta
thinks
he
might
be
connected
with
the
attack
on
your
palace
said
ugolini
but
such
a
man
as
david
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
mascalzoni
as
the
filippeschi
i
too
have
opposed
the
alliance
and
yet
you
and
i
are
friends
it
is
one
thing
to
disagree
in
a
civilized
way
it
is
another
to
turn
to
behave
like
a
scoundrel
david
has
the
same
horror
of
murder
that
we
all
do
remembering
what
she
had
heard
about
the
killings
in
the
cathedral
plaza
sophia
wondered
if
the
contessa
had
any
horror
of
murder
at
all
i
am
sure
that
is
true
said
the
contessa
but
the
podesta
must
have
good
reason
for
detaining
this
david
despair
overwhelmed
sophia
the
tears
that
had
been
falling
in
her
soul
sprang
to
her
eyelids
and
began
to
run
down
her
cheeks
she
should
not
show
her
feelings
like
this
she
thought
but
what
did
it
matter
when
daoud
was
dying
and
no
one
would
lift
a
hand
to
save
him
why
are
you
crying
child
said
the
contessa
sophia
heard
sympathy
in
her
voice
forgive
me
contessa
she
said
sobbing
this
is
very
rude
of
me
does
this
man
mean
so
much
to
you
asked
the
old
lady
her
rasping
voice
softened
in
her
anguish
sophia
was
still
enough
to
see
that
she
might
use
that
anguish
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
terrazzo
floor
and
clasped
the
contessa
around
the
knees
sophia
she
could
hear
ugolini
chair
scrape
as
he
stood
up
the
boy
took
a
step
toward
her
it
is
all
right
said
the
contessa
you
love
this
man
do
you
not
she
patted
sophia
hair
yes
sophia
wept
and
i
swear
to
you
he
is
innocent
is
too
because
he
believes
that
everything
he
is
doing
is
your
eminence
said
the
contessa
you
approve
of
your
niece
and
this
man
from
trebizond
oh
certainly
said
ugolini
waving
his
hands
he
is
a
fine
man
hmm
said
the
old
lady
that
night
at
my
reception
i
thought
you
and
the
young
count
de
gobignon
were
attracted
to
each
other
sophia
felt
a
strange
stab
of
guilt
oh
he
is
too
far
above
me
contessa
she
said
a
count
david
is
a
merchant
we
are
right
for
each
other
is
true
that
david
and
i
are
much
more
suited
than
simon
and
it
makes
me
feel
young
for
a
moment
to
see
a
beautiful
woman
in
love
the
contessa
stroked
sophia
cheek
with
dry
rough
fingers
sophia
opened
her
eyes
wide
and
looked
the
contessa
full
in
the
face
please
help
us
contessa
for
the
sake
of
love
the
contessa
sighed
and
smiled
i
will
send
for
i
will
request
that
he
stop
questioning
your
friend
she
looked
across
at
ugolini
you
must
give
me
your
word
your
eminence
that
this
david
will
not
leave
orvieto
until
all
doubts
about
him

ugolini

vittorio

her
to
her

holding
her

more
tightly
than
was
necessary

not
for
my
outburst

no

of

must
live
in
terror
awhile
longer
until

him
oh

healthy
and

rachel
sat
on
a
divan
by
the
window
in
her
room
she
had
drawn
the
curtains
back
and
pushed
the
shutters
open
so
that
she
could
see
out
and
feel
the
cool
breeze
she
held
a
small
book
in
her
hand
of
the
by
yucaf
ibn
faruzi
a
spanish
jew
it
was
one
of
the
small
store
of
books
angelo
had
owned
written
in
hebrew
that
she
had
kept
with
her
to
help
her
pass
the
long
hours
she
spent
alone
besides
enjoying
reading
she
felt
she
was
somehow
pleasing
angelo
who
had
taught
her
to
read
hebrew
she
was
reading
about
egypt
when
the
second
storm
of
the
morning
struck
orvieto
and
the
window
no
longer
admitted
enough
light
to
read
by
a
few
water
droplets
blew
in
through
the
open
window
to
fall
on
the
open
pages
she
carefully
blotted
them
up
with
the
hem
of
her
satin
robe
but
she
was
afraid
more
rain
would
damage
the
vellum
pages
so
she
shut
the
book
and
watched
the
lightning
flash
and
listened
to
the
thunder
tilia
house
was
built
halfway
down
an
incline
so
sophia
could
see
water
foaming
in
the
ditch
that
ran
through
the
center
of
the
street
so
heavy
was
the
rain
that
waves
were
flowing
down
the
cobblestones
where
a
raindrop
struck
the
water
the
splash
was
like
a
little
crown
a
dark
shadow
appeared
at
the
high
end
of
the
street
a
hooded
figure
another
followed
and
another
they
rose
higher
and
higher
until
she
could
see
that
they
were
riding
horses
what
were
men
doing
out
in
a
storm
like
this
were
they
coming
here
they
were
the
first
men
reined
up
their
horses
outside
tilia
front
door
dismounted
and
moved
to
the
shelter
of
the
overhanging
houses
across
the
street
more
men
on
horses
some
on
mules
and
many
more
on
foot
gathered
outside
the
house
all
wore
hoods
or
hats
to
keep
the
rain
from
their
heads
rachel
heart
began
to
thud
in
her
chest
when
she
saw
there
were
too
many
for
her
to
count
she
saw
the
gleam
of
helmets
under
some
of
the
hoods
the
wet
glitter
of
mail
when
an
arm
or
leg
emerged
from
a
cloak
a
train
of
mules
carrying
heavy
packs
came
down
the
street
and
stopped
rachel
began
to
tremble
these
men
had
not
come
for
pleasure
there
were
too
many
of
them
and
their
dress
and
manner
was
full
of
menace
she
was
glad
that
the
heavy
rain
forced
them
to
keep
their
heads
down
otherwise
one
of
them
might
have
looked
up
here
and
seen
her
she
drew
back
a
little
from
the
window
a
line
of
covered
carts
drawn
by
pairs
of
mules
pulled
up
behind
the
crowd
of
armed
men
the
cart
in
the
lead
was
bright
yellow
and
red
and
its
paint
glistened
wetly
did
anyone
else
in
the
house
know
this
crowd
was
out
there
perhaps
no
one
else
was
looking
out
a
window
she
ran
to
the
door
of
her
room
just
as
she
heard
a
pounding
from
below
then
there
were
shouts
bangs
and
crashes
the
shrill
shattering
of
glass
and
porcelain
the
heavy
thumps
of
bodies
falling
rachel
opened
her
door
other
doors
swung
open
along
the
shadowy
corridor
someone
stepped
out
with
a
candle
frightened
women
faces
were
white
in
the
candlelight
she
saw
antonia
angela
gloria
she
did
not
see
tilia
she
must
still
be
with
sophia
wherever
they
had
gone
this
morning
if
only
sophia
had
taken
me
with
her
as
i
begged
her
to
i
knew
something
terrible
was
going
to
what
is
it
the
women
cried
to
one
another
who
is
down
there
wounds
of
jesus
cassio
emerged
from
francesca
room
tying
the
drawstring
of
his
hose
he
was
a
big
man
his
bare
chest
matted
with
black
hair
and
the
sight
of
him
comforted
rachel
until
she
looked
into
his
face
as
he
hurried
past
her
and
saw
that
it
was
tight
and
pale
with
fear
and
he
was
carrying
a
naked
shortsword
but
cassio
appearance
emboldened
the
women
and
they
left
their
rooms
to
crowd
toward
the
top
of
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
lower
floors
rachel
joined
them
i
saw
a
lot
of
men
outside
rachel
told
the
others
her
heart
battering
against
her
breastbone
armed
men
with
horses
and
mules
and
wagons
antonia
a
woman
hair
dyed
red
with
henna
pulled
her
robe
around
her
another
party
setting
out
for
perugia
i
suppose
they
probably
stopped
by
for
a
little
farewell
fun
then
why
are
they
fighting
downstairs
francesca
said
anxiety
sharpening
her
voice
thunder
shook
the
house
drowning
out
the
clamor
of
the
brawling
two
stories
below
then
rachel
heard
the
clang
of
steel
and
cassio
voice
crying
out
angrily
the
carpeted
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
shook
under
heavy
feet
women
screams
mingled
with
the
cries
of
men
arose
on
the
lower
floors
she
pushed
her
way
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
a
group
of
men
were
coming
up
they
had
thrown
back
the
hoods
of
their
brown
cloaks
and
their
pointed
helmets
reflected
the
candlelight
rachel
backed
away
as
she
saw
that
the
men
with
helmets
were
brandishing
long
daggers
the
women
around
her
started
screaming
and
darting
back
into
their
rooms
rachel
bolted
for
her
own
room
the
man
shrill
cry
shot
an
arrow
of
terror
through
her
that
was
john
voice
she
turned
in
the
doorway
of
her
room
and
saw
the
tartar
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
his
soft
black
cap
hiding
most
of
his
white
hair
beside
him
was
a
stocky
woman
and
flanking
them
were
the
swarthy
men
with
their
daggers
john
and
the
other
men
were
all
smiling
as
if
as
antonia
had
said
they
had
come
only
for
a
bit
of
pleasure
but
the
tumult
downstairs
shaking
the
house
more
than
the
thunder
belied
that
john
spoke
to
the
woman
and
she
called
to
rachel
signore
john
must
go
to
perugia
her
italian
was
strangely
accented
he
wishes
you
to
come
with
him
he
will
give
you
many
costly
gifts
rachel
took
a
step
backward
into
her
room
no
i
do
not
want
to
go
not
now
not
when
sophia
had
just
come
to
tell
her
they
were
going
to
take
her
south
with
them
south
to
manfred
kingdom
where
jews
were
treated
like
everyone
else
where
she
might
yet
find
a
place
for
herself
and
forget
that
she
had
sold
her
body
john
and
the
woman
advanced
down
the
corridor
their
guards
with
them
some
of
the
swarthy
men
pushed
open
the
doors
of
the
rooms
they
passed
and
looked
in
the
doors
could
not
be
barred
from
the
inside
tilia
had
always
insisted
on
that
so
no
client
could
lock
himself
in
with
a
woman
and
harm
her
the
men
with
the
daggers
grinned
at
one
another
and
talked
in
a
strange
language
no
i
do
want
to
go
rachel
screamed
she
darted
into
her
room
and
slammed
the
door
frantically
she
looked
around
for
something
to
hold
it
shut
the
door
started
to
open
and
she
threw
herself
against
it
it
closed
for
a
moment
then
she
was
hurled
away
from
it
as
it
swung
inward
john
behind
it
she
screamed
in
fear
the
tartar
who
was
not
much
taller
than
rachel
strode
into
the
room
he
walked
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
swagger
because
he
was
slightly
bowlegged
he
was
talking
rapidly
in
his
language
advancing
on
rachel
and
smiling
he
held
out
his
arms
the
stout
woman
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
without
expression
rachel
backed
away
from
them
her
body
rigid
you
must
come
with
him
now
he
is
in
a
great
hurry
an
army
of
the
pope
enemies
is
less
that
a
day
from
orvieto
and
they
want
to
take
signore
john
and
signore
philip
prisoner
then
let
him
escape
rachel
cried
i
do
not
want
to
go
with
him
she
was
standing
before
her
bed
now
the
woman
spoke
to
john
and
he
answered
quickly
still
smiling
he
says
you
are
precious
to
him
and
he
can
not
leave
you
she
said
tonelessly
she
had
to
get
away
now
or
be
john
prisoner
for
the
rest
of
her
life
panting
more
from
fury
than
from
exertion
rachel
made
a
sudden
jump
to
her
right
and
when
john
stepped
in
that
direction
to
grab
her
she
darted
to
the
left
and
ran
out
the
door
john
translator
made
no
effort
to
stop
her
would
not
have
fooled
him
except
that
he
was
not
expecting
me
to
do
she
thought
as
she
ran
down
the
corridor
she
held
one
thought
in
her
mind
she
must
get
out
of
this
building
she
heard
screams
and
sounds
of
struggle
from
the
rooms
of
the
other
women
she
saw
francesca
fighting
with
a
helmeted
man
and
her
eyes
met
francesca
over
the
man
shoulder
only
one
of
the
men
was
in
the
corridor
now
and
she
had
surprised
him
he
shouted
at
her
and
ran
after
her
gathering
up
the
skirt
of
her
robe
she
raced
down
the
stairs
taking
the
last
four
in
a
leap
the
dark
man
with
the
dagger
was
right
behind
her
and
behind
him
she
could
hear
john
shout
there
was
anger
in
the
tartar
voice
now
that
terrified
her
even
more
did
not
think
i
would
get
away
from
him
this
the
dark
man
grabbed
her
flying
robe
and
she
felt
the
silk
tear
she
had
nothing
on
underneath
the
robe
she
would
not
let
that
stop
her
from
running
she
must
not
let
anything
stop
her
she
heard
the
man
behind
her
calling
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
she
was
in
the
corridor
now
and
she
saw
that
it
was
swarming
with
men
in
helmets
and
mail
struggling
with
tilia
women
some
of
the
men
had
their
breeches
down
she
saw
tall
beautiful
maiga
striking
out
with
her
fists
at
the
helmeted
men
but
they
were
wrestling
with
her
and
forcing
her
onto
her
back
agonized
pity
for
maiga
blazed
up
within
her
but
she
ran
on
one
of
tilia
black
african
servants
was
lying
on
the
floor
across
the
corridor
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
not
moving
again
she
felt
a
surge
of
pity
but
then
terror
gripped
her
are
killing
people
here
my
god
what
are
they
doing
what
are
they
doing
instead
of
going
on
down
the
stairs
from
the
first
floor
gallery
to
the
ground
floor
she
leapt
over
the
body
of
the
black
man
and
ran
into
the
crowd
of
men
and
women
struggling
in
the
hall
am
small
and
i
am
she
thought
and
that
gave
her
the
courage
to
keep
running
the
men
in
the
hall
were
not
interested
in
her
and
she
slithered
past
them
while
john
and
his
bodyguard
stumbled
along
behind
the
bodyguard
voice
sounded
far
away
other
men
were
shouting
at
him
catch
her
yourself
you
damned
armenian
ape
these
men
were
speaking
in
italian
we
already
got
ours
rachel
reached
the
stairs
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
they
led
down
to
the
same
place
as
did
the
main
stairs
the
reception
room
on
the
ground
floor
but
her
pursuers
would
not
know
that
sure
enough
they
were
following
her
through
this
corridor
she
glanced
back
and
saw
that
the
crowd
of
italian
men
had
gotten
in
their
way
so
that
half
the
corridor
was
between
them
rachel
frantically
she
ran
down
to
the
first
floor
there
horror
greeted
her
more
of
tilia
black
men
she
could
not
count
were
sprawled
around
the
reception
hall
she
saw
blood
spattered
over
the
frescoes
she
saw
a
black
arm
lying
by
itself
one
body
had
no
head
she
heard
a
scream
of
horror
and
knew
it
was
her
own
voice
why
were
they
doing
this
what
devils
drove
them
there
was
blood
all
over
the
floor
puddles
of
it
she
had
to
dart
around
them
over
them
terror
streaked
through
her
as
a
tall
man
blocked
her
path
his
hood
was
thrown
back
and
his
cloak
was
open
and
a
jeweled
cross
glittered
on
his
chest
like
the
one
tilia
wore
only
three
times
bigger
their
eyes
met
his
were
staring
and
full
of
rage
his
nose
was
big
and
his
mouth
was
small
and
cruel
he
pointed
a
long
finger
at
her
a
fortune
in
jeweled
rings
glittering
on
his
gloved
hand
you
the
one
we
came
for
stop
she
stood
paralyzed
as
a
recollection
of
the
dread
face
before
her
flashed
into
her
mind
dinners
for
john
and
philip
tilia
had
given
elegant
dinners
three
or
four
of
them
with
musicians
and
the
companionship
of
her
ladies
rachel
included
and
this
was
how
they
repaid
her
courtesy
this
man
had
been
a
guest
at
those
dinners
he
was
a
man
of
very
high
rank
a
cardinal
in
the
christian
church
he
was
french
she
remembered
his
italian
words
were
heavily
accented
will
they
do
to
me
if
i
do
obey
him
will
they
burn
me
for
being
a
jew
and
there
was
the
other
tartar
philip
standing
beside
the
french
churchman
he
looked
like
john
round
head
brown
skin
slitted
eyes
except
that
his
beard
and
mustache
were
black
he
was
carrying
a
bow
in
one
hand
and
had
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
slung
over
one
shoulder
rachel
froze
like
a
rabbit
trapped
by
two
wolves
the
tall
frenchman
reached
for
rachel
but
another
figure
appeared
between
them
one
of
tilia
black
men
he
blocked
the
tall
man
with
the
cross
giving
rachel
a
chance
to
jump
for
the
door
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
rachel
saw
philip
strong
white
teeth
gleaming
in
a
brown
face
raise
his
bow
she
heard
the
thrum
of
the
string
and
then
a
piercing
scream
anguish
for
the
black
man
welled
up
in
her
her
torn
robe
was
flapping
as
she
ran
out
the
door
she
almost
fell
as
someone
seized
the
back
of
her
robe
and
yanked
on
it
she
twisted
out
of
the
robe
and
ran
on
naked
she
heard
john
shrill
voice
he
had
reached
the
ground
floor
she
was
out
of
the
house
in
an
instant
her
bare
body
was
from
head
to
toe
a
group
of
big
men
holding
horses
stood
across
the
street
under
the
overhang
of
the
house
opposite
tilia
they
were
wearing
swords
and
purple
surcoats
over
mail
shirts
they
looked
at
her
gloomily
and
made
no
move
to
stop
her
she
had
no
idea
where
to
go
but
downhill
was
the
easiest
direction
maybe
hide
in
an
alley
knock
on
a
door
and
beg
for
help
try
to
get
across
town
to
sophia
anywhere
if
only
she
could
get
away
from
john
many
times
she
had
nightmares
of
running
from
something
that
was
trying
to
kill
her
sometimes
a
monster
or
a
demon
sometimes
from
crowds
of
roaring
people
carrying
torches
always
in
those
dreams
she
could
not
make
her
legs
move
it
was
like
trying
to
run
through
water
always
she
tried
to
scream
for
help
and
no
sound
would
come
from
her
throat
but
a
whisper
now
she
was
able
to
run
full
speed
away
from
that
house
where
death
and
destruction
were
running
riot
and
running
as
fast
as
she
could
was
not
enough
it
would
not
get
her
away
fast
enough
from
john
and
his
armed
men
and
that
horrible
cardinal
she
was
able
to
scream
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
but
to
no
avail
nobody
would
come
to
rescue
her
nobody
would
help
her
she
had
also
had
nightmares
about
running
through
the
street
naked
with
hundreds
of
people
watching
in
those
dreams
she
had
been
horribly
embarrassed
now
she
was
really
doing
it
and
she
did
not
care
about
her
nakedness
she
darted
past
the
carts
and
the
horses
and
mules
and
their
drivers
that
filled
the
street
from
side
to
side
she
was
running
naked
and
barefoot
over
the
cobblestones
she
ran
past
the
red
and
yellow
cart
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
wagons
and
saw
sitting
beside
the
driver
a
man
with
a
full
white
beard
he
was
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
was
a
rabbi
then
she
saw
his
shaven
scalp
and
brown
robe
one
of
those
christian
begging
monks
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
to
her
but
she
was
past
him
already
she
heard
hoofbeats
behind
her
and
gooseflesh
broke
out
all
over
her
naked
body
god
is
he
chasing
me
on
horseback
but
she
could
dart
into
a
quintana
the
space
between
two
houses
it
would
be
too
narrow
for
a
man
on
horseback
to
follow
her
she
saw
an
opening
on
her
left
and
made
for
it
begging
god
to
help
her
run
faster
she
felt
something
whip
around
her
body
tearing
her
skin
she
was
jerked
off
her
feet
she
fell
on
her
back
on
the
wet
cobblestones
she
lay
helpless
stunned
and
gasping
for
air
a
rope
was
cutting
into
her
chest
just
below
her
breasts
pinning
her
arms
above
the
elbows
to
her
sides
the
rope
burned
her
her
back
felt
scraped
and
bruised
she
saw
a
horse
legs
beside
her
john
was
grinning
down
at
her
holding
the
other
end
of
the
rope
the
rain
pouring
down
in
her
face
stung
her
eyes
now
that
she
knew
she
was
caught
and
helpless
her
terror
was
transmuted
into
rage
what
right
had
he
to
treat
her
this
way
may
god
strike
you
dead
she
spat
he
might
not
know
the
words
but
she
was
sure
he
could
hear
the
hatred
in
her
voice
he
tugged
on
the
rope
to
make
her
climb
to
her
feet
she
felt
she
would
rather
lie
there
and
make
him
drag
her
if
he
wanted
her
so
badly
but
she
realized
that
would
only
hurt
her
worse
she
took
a
grip
on
the
rope
to
haul
herself
up
the
cold
rain
beat
down
plastering
her
hair
to
her
head
she
wanted
to
wipe
her
face
but
her
arms
were
pinioned
her
back
felt
as
if
it
were
on
fire
she
looked
at
tilia
house
and
saw
that
a
man
body
was
swinging
sodden
and
limp
above
the
door
her
stomach
turning
at
the
sight
she
recognized
cassio
features
in
the
swollen
blackened
face
they
had
hanged
him
from
crenellated
balcony
and
she
had
always
thought
he
was
such
a
big
tough
man
she
felt
a
stab
of
pity
for
him
even
though
he
had
never
been
especially
nice
to
her
her
heart
grew
heavier
and
colder
in
her
chest
as
the
horror
sank
in
these
men
had
destroyed
tilia
house
killed
the
men
and
raped
the
women
with
the
gleeful
cruelty
of
small
boys
stoning
a
bird
nest
another
jerk
on
the
rope
started
her
walking
back
up
the
street
she
kept
her
eyes
down
to
avoid
the
sight
of
cassio
body
as
they
passed
the
yellow
cart
a
voice
called
out
to
the
tartar
and
he
answered
briefly
in
what
seemed
to
be
his
own
language
again
the
voice
and
there
was
command
in
the
tone
john
reined
his
horse
to
a
stop
apprehension
filled
her
what
new
indignity
would
she
have
to
suffer
very
slowly
the
christian
priest
climbed
down
from
the
cart
he
pulled
his
hood
up
against
the
rain
rachel
put
one
hand
between
her
legs
and
tried
to
cover
her
breasts
with
her
forearm
lest
he
be
offended
fear
and
the
cold
rain
beating
down
on
her
naked
flesh
made
her
shiver
violently
she
could
not
hope
for
kindness
from
this
man
after
all
as
a
priest
he
must
condemn
her
as
a
harlot
and
if
he
found
out
she
was
a
jew
he
would
despise
her
all
the
more
the
priest
reached
up
into
the
cart
and
took
down
a
long
walking
staff
and
a
gray
blanket
leaning
on
the
staff
he
approached
her
slowly
looking
at
her
very
sadly
unconcerned
about
the
rain
soaking
his
robe
he
draped
the
blanket
over
her
head
and
shoulders
she
gripped
the
edges
of
the
blanket
and
pulled
it
across
her
as
long
as
john
rope
stayed
slack
the
blanket
would
cover
her
although
it
was
already
cold
and
heavy
with
rainwater
the
kindness
in
the
seamed
bearded
face
warmed
rachel
and
she
dropped
to
her
knees
before
him
help
me
father
she
begged
do
not
let
him
take
me
away
from
here
get
up
child
leaning
heavily
on
the
staff
with
one
hand
he
used
the
other
to
help
her
to
her
feet
and
she
saw
how
stiffly
he
moved
and
heard
him
give
a
little
groan
of
pain
you
are
hurt
father
just
a
few
old
broken
bones
he
said
it
has
been
months
and
they
are
mending
well
enough
he
reached
under
the
blanket
that
covered
her
and
she
shrank
away
from
his
hand
forgive
me
he
said
i
mean
no
harm
without
looking
at
her
and
hardly
touching
her
he
managed
to
loosen
the
rope
around
her
chest
so
that
it
fell
to
the
ground
she
stepped
out
of
the
loop
and
it
slid
away
from
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
john
coil
the
rope
and
tie
it
to
his
saddle
his
face
was
reddened
and
his
mouth
compressed
with
anger
it
is
useless
to
try
to
outrun
a
tartar
on
horseback
said
the
priest
they
are
like
centaurs
what
is
your
name
child
as
she
told
him
rachel
felt
a
glimmering
of
hope
the
priest
had
spoken
to
john
in
his
own
language
and
the
tartar
seemed
to
have
some
respect
for
him
at
least
he
was
no
longer
trying
to
drag
her
away
i
am
friar
mathieu
said
the
priest
what
does
this
man
want
with
you
rachel
felt
a
blush
burn
her
face
he
has
lain
with
me
and
he
paid
money
to
me
and
madama
tilia
rachel
said
barely
able
to
choke
out
the
admission
of
her
shame
now
he
is
leaving
orvieto
and
he
wants
to
take
me
with
him
friar
mathieu
sighed
and
shook
his
head
and
so
young
jesus
be
merciful
he
turned
to
john
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
soft
reasonable
voice
rachel
sensed
that
the
priest
was
chiding
the
tartar
gently
john
answer
was
a
series
of
short
phrases
shrill
with
anger
he
finished
by
slicing
the
air
with
his
hand
in
a
gesture
of
flat
refusal
rachel
heart
grew
heavy
with
despair
he
will
not
listen
to
me
said
the
friar
he
thinks
he
has
a
right
to
take
you
his
customs
are
not
ours
but
you
are
a
priest
does
he
not
have
to
do
what
you
tell
him
sometimes
he
does
what
i
tell
him
to
because
he
a
christian
and
i
have
been
his
companion
and
confessor
for
some
years
but
he
is
more
tartar
than
christian
and
tartars
keep
many
women
rachel
limbs
turned
to
ice
does
he
think
he
owns
me
colder
than
the
rain
pouring
down
on
her
was
the
terror
of
being
torn
from
the
few
friends
she
had
to
be
used
for
pleasure
by
a
man
who
could
not
even
speak
to
her
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
started
to
sob
heavily
a
burst
of
loud
laughter
from
john
made
her
look
up
at
first
she
thought
he
was
laughing
at
her
tears
but
he
was
pointing
at
dangling
body
still
chuckling
he
said
something
to
friar
mathieu
he
says
that
man
used
to
be
the
stud
bull
hereabouts
now
he
is
dead
beef
rachel
shook
her
head
he
has
no
pity
for
cassio
nor
for
me
filled
with
revulsion
she
thought
she
would
rather
die
than
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
with
that
brute
friar
mathieu
looked
off
into
the
distance
that
is
how
it
is
with
the
tartars
rachel
shuddered
to
john
cassio
was
just
a
bundle
of
rags
to
be
laughed
at
and
she
was
a
plaything
to
be
dragged
through
the
world
please
help
me
get
away
she
begged
friar
mathieu
i
think
i
will
kill
myself
if
i
have
to
stay
with
him
friar
mathieu
closed
his
eyes
in
pain
do
not
talk
that
way
my
child
every
person
life
belongs
to
god
another
voice
boomed
down
at
them
from
above
speaking
a
language
rachel
had
heard
before
but
did
not
know
the
man
with
the
big
nose
peered
at
them
out
of
a
cavernous
hood
the
french
cardinal
he
towered
over
them
on
a
great
black
horse
rachel
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
him
said
friar
mathieu
calmly
he
went
on
in
what
must
have
been
french
to
say
something
which
she
supposed
from
his
gestures
was
about
john
and
her
the
cardinal
reply
seemed
as
loud
as
thunder
he
pointed
at
rachel
and
she
cringed
away
what
was
he
saying
that
she
belonged
to
john
feeling
hopeless
rachel
stood
weeping
silently
while
the
priest
and
the
cardinal
argued
what
was
to
become
of
her
in
a
language
she
did
not
understand
god
abandoned
me
because
i
have
sinned
she
looked
at
tilia
house
at
the
horrid
sight
of
the
hanged
man
above
the
door
cries
of
women
barely
audible
over
the
rumble
of
thunder
and
the
pounding
of
rain
on
the
pavement
she
saw
men
carrying
boxes
and
bundles
of
cloth
out
the
front
door
and
realized
that
they
were
ransacking
the
place
cold
horror
swept
her
as
she
realized
she
was
going
to
lose
everything
everything
she
had
earned
by
her
shame
was
in
a
chest
in
tilia
room
friar
mathieu
cried
out
something
in
french
in
the
midst
of
her
misery
rachel
was
shocked
to
see
a
publicly
chastising
a
cardinal
the
cardinal
stared
at
the
friar
seemingly
also
shocked
he
blinked
as
lightning
flashed
overhead
rachel
said
good
father
the
cardinal
found
his
voice
and
roared
back
at
the
friar
jabbing
a
bejeweled
finger
at
rachel
and
turning
on
her
a
glare
of
utter
contempt
his
look
hurt
rachel
as
much
as
if
he
had
hit
her
in
the
face
with
dung
she
pulled
the
soaking
blanket
tighter
around
herself
she
saw
that
staunch
as
the
friar
might
be
all
the
power
was
on
the
other
side
father
she
said
if
nothing
can
stop
them
from
taking
me
at
least
let
me
get
the
things
i
own
from
the
house
my
clothes
and
books
she
did
not
mention
the
bags
of
gold
ducats
in
tilia
chest
though
john
might
know
of
them
let
me
take
them
with
me
and
travel
with
you
friar
mathieu
nodded
and
spoke
again
angrily
to
the
cardinal
the
cardinal
yanked
on
the
reins
of
his
horse
turning
the
black
head
around
up
the
street
he
flung
his
answer
over
his
shoulder
friar
mathieu
turned
a
sad
face
toward
rachel
he
says
you
and
i
and
john
can
go
back
into
the
house
and
get
what
belongs
to
you
and
you
can
travel
in
my
cart
but
i
am
not
to
interfere
if
the
tartar
desires
you
he
shook
his
head
i
promise
you
child
as
long
as
you
are
with
me
john
will
not
touch
you
i
was
a
knight
before
i
was
a
priest
they
can
make
me
stand
by
and
witness
murder
and
robbery
but
not
rape
rachel
looked
up
to
see
john
grinning
at
her
with
proprietary
pride
like
rachel
he
had
not
understood
a
word
of
the
argument
between
the
friar
and
the
cardinal
but
he
understood
well
enough
that
rachel
was
still
his
prisoner
she
felt
a
little
better
for
having
an
ally
in
friar
mathieu
but
she
promised
herself
that
whatever
john
might
think
he
would
never
take
her
back
to
his
country
she
really
would
kill
herself
first
the
storm
had
passed
over
orvieto
by
the
time
the
cart
carrying
rachel
was
bumping
along
the
road
to
perugia
as
she
sat
on
a
bench
beside
the
old
priest
looking
out
through
the
open
front
end
of
the
cart
rachel
saw
patches
of
blue
sky
above
the
hills
to
the
northeast
john
had
gone
with
friar
mathieu
and
helped
him
find
her
chest
in
tilia
room
and
the
key
to
the
padlock
hidden
under
tilia
mattress
he
had
ordered
two
of
his
armenian
guards
to
carry
the
chest
out
for
rachel
and
load
it
in
the
back
of
the
cart
along
with
another
chest
of
her
books
and
clothing
he
himself
had
smilingly
handed
her
the
key
as
if
he
expected
her
to
be
grateful
she
thought
so
she
was
still
a
wealthy
woman
rachel
thought
bitterly
even
though
she
was
also
a
prisoner
with
friar
mathieu
sitting
on
the
bench
up
front
beside
the
driver
she
had
gone
to
the
back
of
the
cart
and
opened
both
chests
to
make
sure
everything
was
there
even
hefting
the
bags
of
gold
then
she
had
dried
herself
off
and
put
on
a
bright
blue
linen
tunic
on
the
outside
she
was
more
comfortable
now
within
desolate
even
though
tilia
had
sold
her
to
the
tartar
tilia
house
had
been
home
to
her
for
nearly
a
year
she
had
come
to
know
the
men
whom
today
she
had
seen
murdered
and
the
women
who
had
been
forcibly
taken
by
the
bodyguards
they
and
sophia
david
and
lorenzo
were
the
only
friends
she
had
known
since
angelo
was
killed
now
she
would
never
see
them
again
she
had
not
felt
so
wretched
since
the
night
of
angelo
death
to
comfort
herself
she
took
out
the
hebrew
prayer
book
angelo
had
given
her
to
have
light
to
read
by
she
would
have
to
go
to
the
front
of
the
cart
and
sit
beside
friar
mathieu
the
sight
of
her
prayer
book
might
turn
the
old
priest
against
her
she
remembered
angelo
telling
her
how
priests
at
paris
had
burned
a
thousand
or
more
volumes
of
the
talmud
tears
had
come
to
his
eyes
at
the
thought
of
so
many
holy
books
lovingly
copied
by
hand
destroyed
but
friar
mathieu
had
been
kind
to
her
even
when
she
admitted
that
she
had
lain
with
the
tartar
for
money
he
did
not
seem
like
the
kind
of
man
who
would
despise
her
for
being
a
jew
right
now
she
desperately
needed
to
be
able
to
trust
someone
and
she
decided
that
she
could
trust
friar
mathieu
balancing
herself
against
the
swaying
of
the
cart
she
climbed
on
the
bench
beside
the
old
priest
her
book
was
a
collection
of
writings
and
prayers
including
passages
from
the
torah
some
rabbi
or
perhaps
more
than
one
with
quill
pens
and
parchments
had
taken
years
and
years
to
copy
it
out
she
had
marked
the
psalms
with
a
ribbon
and
turned
to
them
now
lowly
people
you
save
but
haughty
eyes
you
bring
low
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
seen
those
hooded
riders
approaching
tilia
house
she
felt
some
measure
of
peace
after
a
moment
she
realized
friar
mathieu
was
reading
over
her
shoulder
fear
chilled
her
one
rarely
finds
a
learned
enough
to
read
hebrew
said
friar
mathieu
gently
in
a
woman
as
young
as
yourself
it
is
positively
miraculous
she
smiled
timidly
in
answer
to
the
kindliness
in
his
eyes
my
husband
was
a
seller
of
books
he
taught
me
to
read
the
language
of
our
ancestors
your
husband
his
eyes
their
blue
irises
pale
with
age
opened
wider
you
have
been
married
he
shook
his
head
people
never
cease
to
surprise
me
i
would
like
to
know
you
better
child
will
you
tell
me
about
your
life
his
gentle
tone
gave
her
heart
not
since
sophia
had
talked
to
her
on
the
road
from
rome
to
orvieto
had
anybody
been
interested
in
who
she
was
talking
to
this
good
priest
about
her
past
she
could
forget
for
a
while
the
terror
of
present
and
future
she
would
tell
him
everything
liv
daoud
suddenly
realized
that
droplets
of
moisture
had
appeared
on
the
wall
near
his
face
how
long
the
water
had
been
forming
he
did
not
could
not
know
long
enough
for
some
of
the
droplets
to
coalesce
and
run
down
the
wall
where
they
joined
a
line
of
dampness
where
the
floor
met
the
wall
he
wondered
where
the
water
was
coming
from
it
might
be
raining
outside
above
this
dungeon
it
would
take
he
thought
a
very
great
rainstorm
for
the
water
to
seep
through
down
here
he
lay
on
his
stomach
on
the
rack
table
his
stretched
arms
and
legs
feeling
like
blocks
of
wood
he
had
no
idea
how
much
time
had
passed
since
left
him
with
the
threat
that
when
he
returned
he
would
burn
daoud
manhood
away
with
greek
fire
most
of
that
time
he
had
been
awake
but
had
been
dreaming
of
the
paradise
of
the
hashishiyya
erculio
had
slept
on
a
pile
of
rags
in
a
corner
of
the
dungeon
leaving
it
to
the
guards
to
make
sure
that
order
was
carried
out
and
daoud
remained
awake
the
guards
were
as
erculio
must
have
known
they
would
be
halfhearted
about
carrying
out
their
mandate
they
poked
and
struck
him
with
sticks
at
intervals
but
they
did
not
try
to
injure
him
daoud
was
even
able
to
sleep
for
brief
periods
between
their
proddings
they
let
most
of
the
candles
in
the
dungeon
go
out
leaving
the
great
stone
chamber
in
semidarkness
erculio
managed
to
talk
to
him
when
the
two
guards
were
dozing
he
held
up
what
looked
like
a
large
pearl
there
is
a
poison
sealed
inside
this
glass
ball
when
he
comes
to
burn
your
prickle
off
i
will
slip
it
into
your
mouth
when
you
feel
the
fire
break
the
ball
with
your
teeth
and
swallow
it
will
look
as
though
the
pain
killed
you
if
you
can
manage
it
swallow
the
glass
too
so
they
do
not
find
it
in
your
mouth
after
you
dead
so
calm
did
daoud
sufi
training
keep
him
that
he
was
able
to
wonder
where
erculio
had
got
such
a
thing
and
how
the
poison
was
sealed
inside
the
ball
and
what
kind
of
poison
it
was
he
could
even
think
calmly
about
what
it
would
feel
like
when
the
poison
was
killing
him
erculio
was
taking
a
huge
chance
he
realized
might
well
discover
that
poison
had
killed
daoud
the
podesta
was
a
very
clever
and
knowledgeable
man
and
if
he
did
discover
the
poison
he
would
of
course
reason
that
erculio
had
done
it
in
the
midst
of
his
calm
daoud
felt
admiration
for
the
little
bent
man
courage
inevitably
with
the
passing
of
so
many
hours
the
pain
of
the
cuts
and
bruises
and
burns
he
had
already
suffered
and
the
ache
of
lying
in
the
same
position
with
his
limbs
stretched
beyond
endurance
would
at
times
break
through
the
mental
wall
he
had
built
up
against
it
remembering
the
words
of
sheikh
saadi
pain
comes
despite
your
training
invite
it
into
your
soul
tent
as
you
would
a
welcome
he
allowed
the
pain
to
wash
over
him
and
when
the
first
acute
shock
of
it
had
passed
he
was
able
to
restore
the
wall
from
time
to
time
he
would
think
of
what
was
soon
going
to
happen
to
him
and
it
would
be
like
a
spear
of
ice
driven
into
his
heart
again
he
let
himself
feel
the
terror
the
anguish
the
agonized
wondering
will
he
come
and
then
when
his
mind
was
numbed
by
the
horror
of
it
cast
it
out
again
if
he
had
not
had
the
training
of
those
two
great
and
very
different
masters
sheikh
saadi
and
fayum
he
would
have
been
mad
with
terror
by
now
each
time
the
door
to
the
dungeon
opened
the
spear
of
ice
pierced
him
again
would
it
be
now
that
he
would
lose
his
manhood
in
pain
beyond
imagining
pain
so
great
that
he
would
gladly
die
at
once
when
no
one
was
nearby
erculio
came
close
cursed
at
him
loudly
punched
him
and
whispered
he
is
gone
much
longer
than
he
said
he
would
be
it
is
late
afternoon
i
told
you
he
does
not
want
to
do
this
he
will
do
daoud
thought
sometime
later
daoud
could
not
tell
how
long
the
door
swung
open
and
strode
in
daoud
let
the
cold
fear
flood
into
him
he
even
let
himself
whimper
a
bit
the
tide
of
maddening
terror
reached
its
height
and
then
receded
and
he
was
in
command
of
himself
again
the
two
guards
snapped
to
attention
and
erculio
scurried
over
to
him
the
podesta
face
was
set
and
when
he
came
close
to
daoud
there
was
pain
in
his
eyes
has
he
spoken
he
said
to
erculio
not
a
word
signore
and
i
have
made
him
suffer
greatly
shall
be
leaving
this
world
just
moments
from
now
i
will
fix
my
thoughts
on
i
gave
you
more
time
than
i
intended
to
said
to
daoud
there
was
a
small
battaglia
at
a
bordello
on
the
east
side
of
town
a
place
you
are
familiar
with
the
house
run
by
that
fat
old
whore
tilia
caballo
where
according
to
her
testimony
you
were
when
the
french
cavaliere
was
murdered
outside
cardinal
ugolini
your
putana
friend
has
been
despoiled
i
fear
and
many
of
her
menservants
killed
and
her
women
hurt
he
desperately
wanted
to
know
whether
rachel
had
been
hurt
and
he
dared
not
speak
of
her
to
anguish
for
rachel
cracked
his
armor
against
fear
he
saw
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
felt
the
liquid
fire
saw
his
death
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
body
he
tried
to
turn
his
mind
back
to
tilia
house
tilia
what
of
tilia
it
surprised
him
that
his
anxiety
for
tilia
was
so
strong
she
had
come
to
be
his
friend
without
his
ever
realizing
it
he
thought
of
francesca
who
had
comforted
him
so
during
his
first
months
in
orvieto
of
the
women
who
had
helped
him
initiate
sordello
all
of
them
no
doubt
raped
and
perhaps
hurt
in
other
ways
besides
savages
this
would
never
have
happened
in
el
it
was
safe
enough
to
ask
who
did
it
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
and
their
guards
as
they
were
leaving
orvieto
to
follow
the
pope
to
perugia
the
french
cardinal
de
verceuil
was
there
and
far
from
trying
to
prevent
the
wickedness
urged
them
on
it
seems
you
dislike
the
tartars
with
good
reason
the
podesta
paused
he
still
hoped
daoud
realized
to
provoke
or
invite
him
into
letting
something
slip
if
it
was
the
tartars
they
must
have
come
for
rachel
picked
up
the
flask
of
greek
fire
from
the
table
where
it
had
stood
these
many
hours
where
daoud
could
plainly
see
it
he
had
most
of
the
time
avoided
looking
at
it
were
any
of
the
women
taken
away
daoud
asked
that
too
should
be
a
safe
question
every
moment
he
and
talked
hoping
he
might
yet
learn
something
was
another
moment
of
wholeness
and
life
i
must
not
deceive
myself
these
are
only
moments
i
affirm
that
god
is
one
god
be
merciful
god
receive
me
i
die
as
your
yes
said
eyeing
him
thoughtfully
did
you
have
reason
to
think
someone
would
be
carried
off
it
hurt
daoud
neck
to
turn
and
try
to
look
into
face
daoud
let
his
head
fall
to
the
table
on
which
he
lay
i
visited
there
often
i
made
friends
with
some
of
the
women
snorted
from
now
on
you
will
have
no
need
to
go
to
bordellos
to
gain
another
moment
daoud
said
i
marvel
that
you
possess
greek
fire
the
making
of
it
is
a
great
secret
and
it
is
too
dangerous
to
transport
far
if
a
bit
of
it
gets
loose
on
a
ship
that
ship
is
seen
no
more
squinted
at
him
if
you
were
truly
only
a
trader
from
trebizond
you
would
be
too
terrified
to
wonder
where
i
got
this
stuff
allow
me
at
the
last
a
bit
of
dignity
daoud
pleaded
looking
up
at
he
saw
guilt
in
shifting
eyes
a
member
of
the
knights
templar
back
from
the
holy
land
let
me
copy
the
formula
said
out
of
curiosity
i
had
an
alchemist
make
it
for
me
curiosity
is
a
worthier
motive
than
torture
said
daoud
hoping
he
was
undermining
resolution
and
making
the
podesta
feel
ashamed
but
the
dark
eyes
flashed
angrily
that
is
enough
turn
him
on
his
back
erculio
you
should
have
done
that
already
pushed
him
too
daoud
thought
despairingly
yes
signore
erculio
beckoned
the
guards
here
you
two
help
me
when
his
arms
and
legs
were
untied
daoud
groaned
at
the
sudden
release
of
the
tension
in
stiffened
muscles
a
savage
pain
tore
through
the
numbness
in
his
limbs
be
still
whoreson
erculio
snarled
clamping
a
hand
over
mouth
daoud
felt
the
glass
ball
pressed
against
his
lips
and
opened
his
mouth
to
receive
it
the
ball
was
not
large
about
half
the
size
of
a
pigeon
egg
but
it
felt
huge
in
his
mouth
thinking
about
the
swift
death
it
held
within
it
daoud
wondered
if
it
would
be
easy
or
hard
to
break
the
glass
they
were
tying
his
hands
again
and
he
had
the
ball
under
his
tongue
if
he
tried
to
speak
now
would
know
he
had
something
in
his
mouth
no
more
delaying
by
talking
to
the
podesta
strip
off
his
loincloth
said
and
erculio
tore
it
away
holding
the
flask
in
one
hand
leaned
forward
peering
at
daoud
groin
daoud
could
feel
his
penis
and
scrotum
shrinking
fools
we
men
are
to
be
so
proud
of
our
members
and
think
them
such
sources
of
power
how
truly
vulnerable
is
that
little
bit
of
one
moment
he
was
able
to
think
the
next
he
was
adrift
on
a
sea
of
terror
his
naked
body
shook
violently
as
scrutinized
him
he
struggled
to
keep
his
sufi
training
in
mind
only
that
could
help
him
now
to
die
bravely
he
is
circumcised
said
his
black
eyebrows
twisting
in
a
frown
god
cloud
his
what
do
we
know
of
that
place
he
comes
from
said
erculio
trebizond
maybe
all
the
men
in
trebizond
are
circumcised
only
jews
are
circumcised
said
and
saracens
he
brought
his
face
closer
to
daoud
speak
man
why
is
your
foreskin
cut
off
how
could
he
be
a
saracen
or
a
jew
said
erculio
he
looks
like
a
frank
shut
up
said
impatiently
i
want
to
hear
his
answer
daoud
lay
motionless
praying
that
god
would
let
kill
him
and
be
done
with
it
are
you
part
of
some
jewish
plot
demanded
daoud
almost
smiled
at
that
but
he
only
looked
up
at
the
blackened
ceiling
beam
and
said
nothing
answer
me
growled
he
shook
the
flask
at
daoud
daoud
closed
his
eyes
now
the
fire
would
come
he
heard
a
hammering
at
the
wooden
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
dungeon
one
of
the
guards
went
to
open
it
at
command
another
delay
now
he
was
almost
frantic
for
it
to
end
he
was
tempted
to
bite
down
on
the
little
glass
ball
why
must
he
wait
and
wait
for
that
terrible
flame
to
burn
away
his
life
signore
daoud
turned
his
head
and
saw
the
clerk
called
vincenzo
in
the
doorway
of
the
dungeon
beside
him
was
a
man
in
orange
and
green
the
colors
of
the
monaldeschi
family
daoud
remembered
the
thick
black
brows
and
the
stern
face
the
grizzled
hair
he
had
seen
this
man
the
night
of
the
contessa
reception
for
the
tartars
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
steward
brings
a
message
from
her
vincenzo
said
with
a
sigh
set
the
flask
of
greek
fire
on
the
table
beside
daoud
in
the
sigh
daoud
heard
not
impatience
but
relief
was
glad
to
put
off
doing
this
unspeakable
thing
but
it
meant
only
that
daoud
would
have
to
endure
a
longer
wait
he
does
not
want
to
torture
me
i
suffer
the
was
still
hoping
the
waiting
would
break
him
and
it
might
in
spite
of
all
his
training
in
spite
of
the
soma
that
kept
him
calm
and
held
the
pain
away
daoud
felt
himself
at
the
very
edge
of
his
endurance
he
just
might
break
the
podesta
the
clerk
and
the
contessa
steward
muttered
together
by
the
door
of
the
dungeon
turning
his
head
daoud
could
watch
them
was
jabbing
his
hands
furiously
toward
the
steward
he
was
having
trouble
keeping
his
voice
down
this
is
intolerable
he
cried
the
steward
took
a
step
backward
but
he
kept
his
face
set
he
spoke
in
a
voice
too
low
for
daoud
to
hear
fires
of
hell
shook
both
clenched
fists
over
his
head
he
turned
and
pointed
at
daoud
keep
that
one
there
on
the
rack
till
i
return
erculio
where
is
my
signore
going
opened
his
mouth
his
face
grew
redder
in
the
torchlight
and
he
closed
it
again
i
will
not
be
gone
very
long
he
said
i
have
to
someone
of
something
shall
i
torment
this
fellow
while
you
are
gone
do
as
you
please
at
least
see
that
he
gets
no
rest
he
strode
across
the
room
to
glare
down
at
daoud
you
will
keep
your
manhood
for
another
hour
or
so
by
god
grace
you
have
more
time
to
think
about
what
will
happen
to
you
and
how
you
can
save
yourself
do
not
think
you
have
escaped
i
will
be
back
he
lifted
his
hand
a
bolt
of
panic
shot
through
daoud
as
he
thought
that
if
hit
him
hard
enough
he
might
break
the
ball
of
poison
in
his
mouth
he
held
himself
rigid
lowered
his
hand
damn
you
he
snarled
and
turned
away
now
daoud
wished
broken
the
glass
ball
he
would
have
to
lie
for
hours
longer
now
waiting
for
pain
and
death
the
thought
of
those
hours
was
in
itself
more
agonizing
than
all
the
tortures
he
had
so
far
suffered
but
god
had
chosen
to
let
him
live
a
little
longer
and
he
must
accept
these
moments
of
life
according
to
vincenzo
erculio
whispered
the
contessa
ordered
the
podesta
to
stop
torturing
you
your
allies
must
have
gotten
to
her
the
guards
and
the
clerk
had
left
but
daoud
heard
their
excited
voices
beyond
the
partly
open
door
erculio
now
had
a
chance
to
take
out
the
poison
ball
the
inside
of
daoud
mouth
ached
from
holding
the
delicate
orb
and
he
sighed
with
relief
there
is
more
erculio
said
an
army
of
sienese
ghibellini
passed
through
montefiascone
this
morning
we
have
known
that
the
sienese
were
marching
against
orvieto
but
we
were
not
aware
they
were
almost
upon
us
the
contessa
and
the
podesta
must
discuss
the
defense
as
well
as
your
fate
lorenzo
was
with
that
army
daoud
thought
lorenzo
might
be
able
to
rescue
him
if
he
got
here
in
time
i
fear
it
will
be
no
better
for
you
than
before
erculio
went
on
knows
how
to
make
the
contessa
see
things
his
way
he
will
probably
persuade
her
that
you
must
be
tortured
and
since
he
suspects
you
of
being
a
ghibellino
agent
he
will
want
you
dead
before
the
ghibellini
army
comes
as
god
wills
daoud
croaked
a
numbness
had
come
over
him
as
if
he
were
already
dead
this
was
older
and
simpler
and
more
effective
than
the
techniques
of
sufi
and
hashishiyya
this
deadness
was
his
final
answer
to
a
night
and
a
day
of
unbearable
pain
and
fear
lv
the
woman
shoulders
shook
and
she
rocked
back
and
forth
she
could
not
speak
tilia
sat
on
sophia
bed
holding
the
sobbing
woman
in
her
arms
tilia
calling
her
francesca
tried
to
calm
her
sophia
at
first
had
thought
francesca
was
a
madwoman
her
tunic
was
torn
and
her
long
black
hair
not
bound
up
and
covered
but
in
wild
disarray
you
are
safe
now
piccione
tilia
kept
saying
calm
down
and
tell
us
what
happened
tilia
herself
was
pale
her
wide
mouth
drawn
tight
seeing
even
tilia
face
grim
sophia
felt
a
chill
of
apprehension
and
an
even
greater
anxiety
to
know
what
this
was
all
about
i
know
i
should
not
come
here
madama
forgive
me
but
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
i
walked
so
far
to
get
here
and
i
kept
getting
lost
and
i
was
afraid
to
ask
anyone
where
cardinal
ugolini
mansion
was
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
francesca
tilia
asked
cassio
told
me
just
before
before
francesca
was
convulsed
with
sobs
tilia
turned
to
sophia
i
have
never
seen
her
like
this
your
house
is
destroyed
said
francesca
choking
and
gasping
and
wiping
her
nose
on
her
sleeve
destroyed
tilia
and
sophia
stared
at
each
other
a
shock
of
fear
swept
through
sophia
already
terrified
for
daoud
she
was
now
swept
by
dread
for
rachel
and
pity
for
tilia
more
of
this
and
i
will
lose
my
and
they
hanged
cassio
oh
my
god
tilia
screamed
another
jolt
of
terror
sophia
thought
of
that
day
in
constantinople
when
the
franks
had
run
riot
burning
whole
districts
and
murdering
townspeople
was
this
another
such
day
and
they
and
they
killed
hector
and
claudio
and
apollonio
and
the
other
menservants
who
did
this
tilia
was
on
her
feet
standing
over
francesca
shouting
who
who
was
the
whole
world
turning
against
them
sophia
wondered
was
it
the
podesta
men
the
monaldeschi
francesca
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
wept
softly
for
a
moment
then
continued
the
tartars
and
that
french
cardinal
who
always
came
with
them
they
came
with
armed
men
dozens
of
them
they
were
after
rachel
the
horror
of
it
all
was
like
a
spear
driven
through
sophia
breast
she
sat
down
on
her
bed
as
the
room
went
black
around
her
oh
no
she
heard
herself
saying
oh
not
rachel
fear
stopped
her
heart
she
slumped
on
the
bed
her
hand
pressed
to
her
chest
when
cassio
tried
to
stop
them
they
went
mad
said
francesca
the
killed
every
man
in
the
house
and
they
raped
all
the
women
some
of
us
over
and
over
again
and
they
tore
the
house
apart
and
stole
everything
they
could
carry
what
they
could
not
take
they
smashed
and
all
the
while
they
kept
laughing
madama
they
kept
laughing
sophia
felt
bile
burning
in
her
throat
if
she
had
to
hear
any
more
horrors
she
was
going
to
vomit
tilia
sat
looking
stunned
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
what
happened
to
rachel
sophia
managed
to
choke
out
she
tried
to
run
away
she
got
out
of
the
house
the
tartar
the
one
who
beds
with
her
chased
her
he
must
have
caught
her
because
i
heard
the
cardinal
shouting
that
they
had
found
the
one
they
came
for
and
they
must
get
on
the
road
or
they
would
be
fighting
the
sienese
wanted
to
come
here
with
me
this
sophia
thought
only
i
had
brought
her
here
we
could
have
saved
she
sobbed
aloud
her
stomach
hurt
may
god
rot
all
of
them
with
leprosy
said
tilia
she
hugged
francesca
hard
and
then
stood
up
i
must
go
to
my
house
going
back
to
tilia
would
not
help
rachel
sophia
thought
they
had
probably
lost
her
forever
despair
dragged
her
down
rachel
what
were
they
doing
to
her
first
david
is
arrested
now
this
she
said
tears
running
steadily
down
her
cheeks
had
trusted
daoud
to
foresee
danger
and
guide
us
through
sophia
thought
now
daoud
she
still
did
not
know
whether
daoud
was
safe
or
even
still
alive
would
the
contessa
be
able
to
stop
whatever
was
being
done
to
daoud
that
had
been
quite
enough
to
be
terrified
about
francesca
eyes
widened
david
has
been
arrested
something
in
her
tone
told
sophia
there
had
been
something
between
francesca
and
david
she
told
herself
you
think
the
man
slept
alone
until
you
gave
yourself
to
him
she
and
francesca
shared
some
of
the
same
grief
sophia
wanted
to
console
her
cardinal
ugolini
has
persuaded
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
to
intercede
for
david
sophia
told
her
and
the
cardinal
has
gone
to
the
palazzo
del
podesta
hoping
to
bring
david
back
here
again
it
may
be
hours
before
david
is
released
said
tilia
raising
a
cautioning
hand
the
podesta
does
agree
or
he
may
persuade
the
contessa
that
he
was
right
to
arrest
david
these
were
the
very
thoughts
that
had
been
tormenting
sophia
she
needed
to
do
something
if
you
want
to
go
to
your
house
tilia
i
will
go
with
you
it
occurred
to
her
immediately
after
she
spoke
that
the
streets
might
be
dangerous
for
both
of
them
but
she
could
not
stand
the
agony
of
sitting
here
waiting
for
the
possibility
of
still
worse
news
sophia
you
and
the
cardinal
must
not
be
linked
to
tilia
bordello
said
tilia
i
will
keep
myself
hidden
said
sophia
sophia
made
francesca
comfortable
in
her
own
bed
then
went
down
with
tilia
to
the
great
hall
of
ugolini
mansion
and
sent
for
riccardo
hand
in
hand
sophia
holding
a
lighted
candle
the
two
women
made
their
way
through
the
tunnel
that
led
to
the
potterymaker
shop
riccardo
met
them
with
another
hired
cart
like
the
one
that
had
taken
them
from
tilia
to
the
cardinal
this
morning
this
was
a
covered
cart
full
of
big
urns
of
olive
oil
the
air
much
cooler
than
before
the
storm
felt
refreshing
on
sophia
face
getting
into
the
cart
sophia
looked
up
and
saw
big
black
clouds
rolling
across
the
sky
their
rounded
edges
outlined
by
the
red
light
of
the
setting
sun
the
cart
pulled
by
an
old
draft
horse
bumped
over
cobblestones
and
splashed
through
puddles
tilia
and
sophia
sat
on
a
bench
behind
riccardo
under
the
cart
canvas
cover
so
they
could
not
be
seen
from
the
street
all
around
them
sophia
heard
church
bells
ringing
for
the
angelus
she
could
close
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
imagine
she
was
hearing
the
bells
of
the
three
hundred
churches
of
constantinople
she
longed
to
be
in
the
polis
again
among
civilized
people
is
why
i
am
here
is
it
not
to
keep
the
barbarians
here
and
away
from
she
saw
torchlight
ahead
this
was
tilia
street
farther
up
a
hill
that
slowed
down
the
elderly
horse
from
this
distance
the
house
looked
undamaged
but
what
was
that
hanging
above
the
door
merciful
god
sophia
whispered
she
saw
the
body
of
a
man
suspended
from
a
rope
tied
to
the
balcony
above
the
doorway
oh
god
said
tilia
oh
poor
poor
cassio
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
her
gown
now
by
the
torchlight
sophia
could
see
several
men
dressed
in
the
yellow
and
blue
of
the
commune
gathered
in
front
of
the
house
the
podesta
watchmen
the
street
was
full
of
common
folk
who
had
to
back
up
to
give
the
cart
room
to
move
forward
as
it
approached
the
front
door
one
of
the
podesta
men
raised
a
hand
to
stop
it
i
will
be
right
back
tilia
said
squeezing
sophia
arm
she
clambered
out
of
the
cart
with
riccardo
help
riccardo
tied
the
cart
to
a
hitching
post
on
the
side
of
the
street
tying
her
scarf
across
her
face
sophia
watched
from
inside
the
cart
the
man
who
had
stopped
the
horse
barred
tilia
again
as
she
started
toward
her
house
he
was
a
slender
man
with
a
prominent
arch
to
his
nose
and
eyes
riccardo
moved
toward
him
but
tilia
put
her
hand
on
the
servant
arm
tilia
would
not
want
the
cardinal
man
brawling
with
an
officer
of
the
watch
i
am
tilia
caballo
and
this
is
my
house
she
said
in
a
commanding
voice
how
long
have
you
been
here
what
a
brave
woman
tilia
was
sophia
thought
could
she
herself
face
an
officer
of
the
watch
and
speak
to
him
sternly
like
that
since
the
hour
of
none
madama
the
podesta
was
here
but
he
had
to
leave
and
what
are
you
doing
just
standing
about
have
you
left
that
poor
man
body
to
hang
there
since
where
women
and
children
could
see
it
take
him
down
at
once
are
you
not
christians
how
can
you
treat
the
dead
with
such
disrespect
in
the
midst
of
her
own
horror
sophia
took
comfort
from
tilia
display
of
strength
and
wondered
how
the
stout
little
woman
felt
inside
sophia
had
hated
her
at
times
and
still
thought
tilia
had
done
a
horrible
wrong
to
rachel
but
what
she
felt
for
her
now
was
mostly
admiration
after
all
all
of
them
were
equally
guilty
of
what
had
happened
to
rachel
the
blame
should
not
fall
on
tilia
alone
the
officer
called
orders
to
others
nearby
but
his
expression
as
he
turned
back
to
tilia
was
surly
there
might
be
some
question
about
whether
was
a
christian
madama
this
is
after
all
a
house
of
ill
repute
ill
tilia
blustered
this
is
this
was
the
handsomest
house
of
pleasure
in
orvieto
and
our
patrons
occupied
the
very
highest
levels
in
the
church
you
would
be
wise
to
have
a
care
how
you
speak
of
my
house
sophia
felt
herself
smiling
amazing
when
there
was
so
much
to
weep
over
would
i
the
officer
thrust
his
nose
at
tilia
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
why
such
a
splendid
bordello
with
such
fine
customers
needed
a
torture
chamber
in
the
cellar
or
why
you
had
to
keep
piccioni
on
the
roof
sophia
body
went
cold
if
they
found
out
those
were
carrier
pigeons
and
where
they
went
the
trouble
here
might
be
deep
indeed
so
that
is
what
you
have
been
doing
tilia
stormed
looting
my
home
and
how
much
did
you
steal
after
the
tartars
left
and
no
doubt
harassing
my
ladies
as
if
they
had
not
been
through
enough
already
and
leaving
my
cassio
to
swing
from
a
rope
my
god
there
has
been
murder
kidnapping
rape
and
theft
done
here
and
you
prattle
of
piccioni
what
have
you
done
about
catching
the
who
did
this
now
the
officer
did
look
intimidated
madama
we
are
not
certain
who
did
these
things
not
certain
tilia
shook
her
fist
at
him
everyone
in
orvieto
knows
who
did
this
it
was
the
french
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
and
the
tartar
ambassadors
to
the
pope
why
are
you
here
standing
about
like
fools
when
you
could
be
pursuing
them
and
bringing
them
to
justice
the
french
thought
sophia
if
simon
had
been
here
would
he
have
allowed
this
to
happen
she
felt
a
twinge
of
guilt
remembering
that
she
had
betrayed
daoud
by
not
telling
him
where
simon
was
going
what
you
tell
us
is
but
hearsay
madama
hearsay
every
lady
in
that
house
is
a
witness
in
any
case
those
you
accuse
are
beyond
our
reach
because
you
them
get
beyond
your
reach
tilia
retorted
oh
you
feckless
man
let
me
by
and
then
sophia
was
alone
in
the
cart
and
frightened
because
she
knew
she
was
surrounded
by
the
podesta
men
and
by
townspeople
who
might
well
be
hostile
for
reassurance
she
smoothed
the
scarf
over
her
nose
and
mouth
and
patted
the
small
dagger
that
hung
at
her
belt
concealed
under
her
outer
tunic
she
heard
a
creaking
noise
above
her
and
looked
out
to
see
the
men
hauling
cassio
body
up
to
the
balcony
tilia
she
thought
was
taking
charge
left
to
themselves
the
watchmen
would
probably
have
just
cut
the
rope
and
let
the
poor
man
corpse
fall
to
the
ground
sophia
thought
of
rachel
helpless
carried
off
by
the
tartar
and
daoud
equally
helpless
in
the
palazzo
del
podesta
she
had
no
idea
what
was
happening
to
either
of
them
and
horrors
filled
her
mind
her
hands
twisted
together
her
fingers
crushing
one
another
and
she
started
to
cry
again
tilia
was
crying
too
when
she
came
back
and
riccardo
helped
her
climb
into
the
carriage
she
could
not
speak
for
a
time
and
sophia
sat
with
her
arm
around
tilia
quaking
shoulders
it
was
for
this
thought
sophia
she
had
come
the
only
way
she
could
help
tilia
was
to
be
with
her
and
to
comfort
her
and
in
doing
so
she
comforted
herself
after
a
while
tilia
gave
a
great
sigh
i
held
cassio
in
my
arms
for
a
time
i
washed
his
poor
face
which
i
could
barely
recognize
what
hurts
most
is
that
all
those
people
those
men
and
those
women
were
loyal
to
me
and
i
was
not
there
when
they
suffered
this
awful
thing
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
sleeve
of
her
green
silk
dress
and
looked
sadly
at
sophia
feeling
tilia
pain
for
her
people
sophia
liked
her
all
the
more
the
tartars
men
probably
would
have
killed
you
if
you
had
been
there
to
be
sure
i
would
have
provoked
them
to
it
as
cassio
did
i
would
not
have
let
them
take
rachel
without
a
fight
she
gripped
the
cross
resting
on
her
bosom
and
sophia
remembered
daoud
saying
it
held
a
poisoned
blade
well
my
poor
men
will
have
good
burials
i
have
been
very
generous
to
the
little
church
of
san
severo
in
the
valley
south
of
here
and
now
the
pastor
can
repay
my
kindness
by
burying
the
seven
who
died
here
they
may
not
have
been
good
christians
or
christians
at
all
but
at
least
in
a
churchyard
they
will
lie
in
peace
the
women
who
are
hurt
badly
will
go
to
the
hospital
of
santa
clara
and
i
must
hire
guards
to
protect
the
house
my
ladies
do
not
want
to
stay
there
i
do
not
blame
them
but
there
is
no
other
roof
to
shelter
them
just
now
and
with
guards
they
will
be
safe
enough
anyway
those
murderers
are
gone
i
will
come
back
and
stay
with
them
when
i
have
done
everything
there
is
to
do
sophia
smiled
at
tilia
in
admiration
she
was
hurt
but
fought
the
pain
by
getting
on
with
what
needed
to
be
done
only
there
were
more
i
could
do
for
rachel
for
tilia
kept
shaking
her
head
they
took
everything
of
value
thank
fortune
most
of
my
money
is
on
deposit
with
the
lombards
but
the
chests
i
kept
in
my
room
are
gone
and
there
were
bags
of
gold
coins
in
them
one
chest
was
rachel
sophia
heart
sank
further
at
that
news
now
rachel
had
not
even
gold
to
make
up
for
all
that
had
been
done
to
her
the
dirty
ladroni
tilia
went
on
that
tartar
and
the
other
one
and
the
cardinal
all
of
them
had
such
merry
times
in
my
house
how
could
they
do
this
to
me
the
tartars
are
simply
doing
as
tartars
do
said
sophia
they
take
what
they
want
and
they
kill
anyone
who
tries
to
stop
them
as
for
the
cardinal
he
is
a
frank
and
if
you
had
seen
what
the
franks
did
to
my
city
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
this
she
felt
helpless
how
could
what
she
was
saying
possibly
comfort
tilia
tilia
struck
the
heel
of
her
hand
against
her
forehead
how
stupid
i
was
when
john
the
tartar
said
he
wanted
to
take
rachel
to
perugia
with
him
i
should
have
known
he
would
not
accept
my
refusal
i
should
have
been
prepared
for
this
sophia
remembering
how
rachel
had
begged
to
leave
tilia
house
with
her
that
morning
spoke
sharply
before
she
could
stop
herself
as
it
was
you
kept
rachel
safe
for
him
until
he
was
ready
to
take
her
tilia
gasped
that
is
very
unfair
now
sophia
was
deeply
angry
with
herself
she
had
already
decided
that
what
had
happened
to
rachel
should
not
be
blamed
on
tilia
and
she
was
trying
or
should
be
trying
to
comfort
her
her
cruel
greek
tongue
had
got
the
better
of
her
sophia
was
about
to
apologize
when
a
shout
from
outside
stopped
her
the
mistress
of
the
whores
house
is
in
this
cart
i
saw
her
get
into
it
now
she
sees
how
god
punishes
fornicators
we
should
never
have
let
her
move
into
our
street
let
her
get
her
house
and
all
of
her
filth
out
of
here
sophia
shrank
back
into
the
cart
her
heart
quaking
she
had
seen
mobs
tear
people
to
pieces
she
said
tilia
that
crowd
frightens
me
and
the
podesta
men
may
not
be
much
protection
let
us
get
out
of
here
please
i
will
show
you
what
i
think
of
that
crowd
said
tilia
she
pushed
her
way
to
the
front
of
the
cart
and
stood
beside
riccardo
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
sophia
could
see
people
gathered
white
faces
in
the
moonlight
red
faces
in
the
torchlight
ignoranti
tilia
shouted
fannulloni
my
house
is
the
best
on
your
street
the
rest
is
one
big
foul
quintana
where
were
you
idlers
when
my
men
were
murdered
and
my
women
were
raped
by
a
gang
of
foreigners
home
pissing
in
your
pants
eh
brave
orvietans
you
are
get
out
of
my
way
sophia
heard
a
muttering
from
the
crowd
but
no
one
tried
to
answer
tilia
sophia
shook
her
head
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
do
think
i
could
ever
face
down
a
mob
like
tilia
turned
to
riccardo
whose
broad
shoulders
beside
her
had
lent
force
to
her
words
drive
on
the
cart
rolled
forward
and
the
people
fell
back
squeezing
against
the
housefronts
to
let
it
by
sophia
devastated
sagged
back
against
a
great
earthenware
olive
oil
jar
she
was
too
worn
out
even
to
cry
anymore
lvi
at
last
this
is
the
thought
daoud
as
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
torment
rasped
open
he
had
been
preparing
himself
for
death
praying
commending
himself
to
god
now
he
hoped
that
without
much
more
pain
god
would
take
him
erculio
who
had
been
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
wall
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
and
scuttled
forward
entered
followed
by
two
guards
in
yellow
and
blue
welcome
back
signore
erculio
cried
shall
we
now
roast
this
stubborn
fellow
ballocks
erculio
daoud
sensed
enjoyed
feigning
the
gleeful
torturer
precisely
because
it
was
a
way
of
tormenting
himself
walked
over
to
where
daoud
lay
naked
on
the
rack
and
glowered
silently
down
at
him
his
lips
pressed
together
under
his
thin
mustache
the
podesta
glanced
at
the
silver
flask
on
the
table
but
made
no
move
to
pick
it
up
he
seemed
to
be
studying
daoud
searching
for
something
as
he
looked
into
his
eyes
he
blinked
and
turned
away
untie
him
what
are
we
going
to
do
to
him
now
signore
said
erculio
still
all
eagerness
he
needed
to
know
daoud
thought
when
it
would
be
time
for
the
poison
ball
untie
him
and
sit
him
up
slowly
said
oh
signore
erculio
exclaimed
may
we
not
play
with
him
some
more
mouth
twisted
enough
of
your
infernal
questions
pervertito
do
as
i
say
the
impact
of
this
surprise
was
like
a
rock
smashing
into
daoud
face
of
steel
what
was
happening
was
he
not
to
have
his
manhood
burned
away
was
he
not
to
die
this
too
could
be
a
trick
realizing
that
the
threat
of
greek
fire
had
not
broken
daoud
might
be
making
one
last
and
very
effective
attempt
to
destroy
his
resolve
by
making
it
seem
his
fortunes
had
suddenly
reversed
themselves
daoud
tried
to
bring
the
upwelling
of
hope
under
control
to
resume
the
face
of
steel
but
something
in
his
bones
was
already
sure
that
he
was
saved
and
spasms
of
trembling
ran
through
his
body
his
face
felt
as
if
it
were
falling
to
pieces
the
mask
of
clay
broken
like
a
useless
pot
bustling
around
the
table
erculio
undid
the
knots
at
his
wrists
and
ankles
in
his
surprise
daoud
relaxed
his
defenses
against
pain
and
agony
stabbed
him
like
spears
in
every
muscle
of
his
body
we
have
not
the
means
to
treat
your
wounds
here
in
this
chamber
said
but
lower
your
legs
over
the
side
of
the
table
and
sit
there
for
a
moment
then
if
you
can
stand
and
walk
we
will
take
you
upstairs
and
my
own
physician
fra
bernardino
will
attend
you
it
be
am
i
to
go
free
joy
burst
up
in
him
like
a
fountain
in
the
desert
the
candlelight
seemed
to
flicker
and
he
nearly
fainted
the
sudden
rush
of
emotion
was
unbearable
unless
this
was
indeed
a
ruse
which
seemed
less
and
less
likely
with
each
passing
moment
his
suffering
was
over
the
contessa
had
prevailed
but
why
why
had
she
intervened
to
save
him
daoud
remembered
his
vision
of
sophia
hurrying
through
the
night
to
tilia
house
had
sophia
done
something
that
brought
the
contessa
into
it
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
daoud
brought
his
eyes
up
to
fix
them
on
the
dark
eyes
of
the
podesta
with
the
deep
black
rings
under
them
stared
back
there
was
a
look
of
defiance
in
eyes
as
if
daoud
were
the
accuser
and
the
one
being
interrogated
daoud
throat
was
tight
and
dry
and
it
ached
when
he
tried
to
speak
but
he
forced
words
out
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
are
you
setting
me
free
the
podesta
nodded
his
lips
tight
it
seems
that
way
why
be
good
enough
to
wait
for
an
explanation
until
we
are
in
private
daoud
tried
to
read
round
swarthy
face
but
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
podesta
was
relieved
or
angry
when
daoud
did
try
to
stand
and
put
his
weight
on
the
burned
and
beaten
soles
of
his
feet
he
had
to
clench
his
teeth
to
keep
himself
from
screaming
his
legs
which
had
borne
the
brunt
of
erculio
attentions
felt
lifeless
and
his
knees
buckled
he
toppled
forward
and
caught
him
the
podesta
staggered
under
daoud
weight
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
a
guard
who
hurried
over
to
help
hold
daoud
up
as
daoud
gasping
leaned
against
him
unclasped
his
cloak
and
wrapped
it
around
daoud
to
cover
his
nakedness
daoud
thought
wryly
think
i
have
suddenly
become
terribly
valuable
to
this
could
not
be
just
the
contessa
influence
he
thought
he
did
not
mean
that
much
to
her
that
must
be
it
erculio
had
said
believed
daoud
was
a
ghibellino
agent
and
therefore
he
would
want
to
kill
daoud
before
the
ghibellino
army
from
siena
got
here
but
not
daoud
thought
if
intended
to
surrender
erculio
pressed
something
into
his
hand
a
small
leather
pouch
the
tawidh
daoud
painfully
bent
his
head
toward
erculio
and
read
gladness
in
the
beady
eyes
may
you
find
work
that
suits
you
better
messer
erculio
said
daoud
give
you
he
thought
what
he
does
suits
him
all
too
well
the
little
monster
said
the
podesta
men
brought
a
litter
and
two
big
guards
complaining
about
daoud
size
slowly
climbed
the
basement
steps
stopped
to
rest
for
a
time
at
the
top
and
then
carried
daoud
up
the
marble
staircase
leading
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
first
floor
of
the
palazzo
del
podesta
they
were
staggering
by
the
time
they
lifted
daoud
onto
a
bed
in
a
small
room
ordered
the
guards
to
send
fra
bernardino
to
him
two
walls
of
the
room
were
lined
with
books
and
boxes
of
scrolls
so
many
books
must
be
worth
a
fortune
daoud
thought
the
other
walls
were
painted
a
pleasant
lemon
color
the
ceiling
a
deep
blue
a
concave
mirror
set
at
an
angle
in
the
wall
beside
the
glazed
mullioned
window
could
direct
daylight
toward
the
writing
table
the
translucent
window
glass
appeared
nearly
black
it
must
be
night
outside
the
floor
was
of
hardwood
planks
very
clean
and
highly
polished
moving
very
slowly
and
painfully
daoud
stretched
himself
out
on
the
yellow
satin
bedcarpet
and
drew
cloak
over
him
like
a
blanket
this
was
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
than
the
table
on
which
he
had
lain
for
what
seemed
like
endless
days
and
nights
he
could
hardly
believe
the
vast
change
that
had
taken
place
i
have
gone
mad
and
this
is
all
like
a
hashish
sat
at
a
plain
oak
table
piled
with
parchments
rolled
and
unrolled
the
candelabra
on
the
table
supplied
the
light
for
the
room
a
slender
blue
vase
with
graceful
twin
handles
stood
on
one
corner
of
the
table
though
this
was
not
a
room
that
would
find
favor
in
the
world
of
islam
daoud
recognized
that
in
his
own
venetian
way
had
a
highly
refined
sense
of
beauty
the
podesta
unlocked
a
tall
box
of
dark
wood
inlaid
with
ivory
that
stood
on
his
desk
lifting
the
lid
he
held
the
flask
of
greek
fire
over
it
we
are
both
lucky
i
did
not
use
this
he
said
he
took
a
folded
white
cloth
from
the
box
and
wrapped
the
flask
then
carefully
he
set
the
flask
upright
in
the
box
closed
the
lid
and
locked
it
daoud
let
out
a
slow
sigh
of
relief
as
he
saw
push
the
box
to
one
side
it
was
becoming
easier
and
easier
to
believe
that
he
was
saved
in
spite
of
the
pain
that
stabbed
at
a
thousand
places
on
his
body
daoud
was
able
to
smile
i
know
why
it
is
lucky
for
me
why
for
you
cardinal
ugolini
and
his
niece
went
to
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
and
insisted
that
you
were
innocent
that
you
were
the
cardinal
guest
they
begged
her
to
command
me
to
release
you
at
once
the
contessa
is
very
simple
in
her
way
and
she
likes
to
do
favors
for
churchmen
so
she
sent
a
message
to
me
that
i
must
stop
your
torture
and
come
to
her
at
once
daoud
could
not
think
he
felt
so
that
it
might
have
been
easy
now
for
to
extract
admissions
from
him
he
had
been
in
pain
and
had
not
eaten
or
slept
in
over
a
day
he
must
pay
careful
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
it
would
never
do
to
be
careless
with
smiled
at
daoud
a
humorless
grimace
that
stretched
his
thin
mustache
i
am
not
going
to
ask
your
forgiveness
said
i
was
doing
what
i
thought
right
daoud
said
nothing
he
felt
was
being
frank
with
him
but
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
forgive
a
man
who
had
caused
him
so
much
pain
and
nearly
killed
him
still
searching
his
heart
as
sheikh
saadi
would
have
recommended
he
found
that
he
felt
no
hatred
for
just
the
wariness
he
would
have
felt
toward
a
very
large
crocodile
i
have
stopped
torturing
you
not
because
the
contessa
told
me
to
went
on
i
probably
could
have
changed
her
mind
but
then
she
and
i
spoke
of
something
else
a
ghibellino
army
from
siena
is
about
to
assault
orvieto
the
contessa
insisted
that
the
militia
which
i
command
defend
orvieto
to
the
last
drop
of
our
blood
he
smiled
again
without
mirth
i
daoud
thought
triumphantly
wants
me
to
intercede
for
him
with
the
ghibellini
of
and
another
happy
thought
came
to
him
last
lorenzo
how
many
men
have
the
sienese
daoud
asked
according
to
reports
i
have
from
the
peasants
who
live
north
of
here
they
number
over
four
thousand
men
i
am
amazed
that
even
so
prosperous
a
city
as
siena
could
hire
such
a
large
army
would
be
even
more
amazed
to
know
where
they
got
the
thought
daoud
went
on
so
we
are
hopelessly
outnumbered
of
course
this
rock
of
orvieto
is
the
most
defensible
position
in
italy
even
with
only
our
few
hundred
we
could
hold
the
sienese
off
for
some
weeks
perhaps
even
months
but
not
indefinitely
the
holy
father
knew
that
which
is
why
he
left
the
city
will
be
taken
and
sacked
the
people
will
suffer
greatly
if
i
am
not
killed
in
the
fighting
i
will
surely
be
hanged
and
after
i
and
all
the
defenders
are
dead
the
contessa
will
consider
the
honor
of
the
city
satisfied
and
will
make
peace
with
the
sienese
well
you
will
have
done
what
you
thought
right
said
daoud
after
the
podesta
had
finished
listing
all
these
evil
consequences
eyebrows
twitched
and
his
lips
quirked
showing
that
he
caught
the
irony
daoud
would
enjoy
this
conversation
more
he
thought
if
his
feet
did
not
throb
if
his
legs
did
not
ache
if
his
torn
back
did
not
burn
as
if
he
were
lying
on
hot
coals
if
his
head
were
not
swimming
i
may
hold
this
post
at
the
contessa
pleasure
but
she
does
not
have
the
right
to
tell
me
to
die
needlessly
and
as
podesta
my
first
concern
is
the
welfare
of
orvieto
if
i
can
come
to
terms
with
the
ghibellini
the
city
will
be
spared
destruction
daoud
held
up
a
hand
the
pain
of
the
gesture
was
excruciating
are
you
not
a
loyal
guelfo
are
you
not
faithful
to
the
papal
cause
how
can
you
speak
of
coming
to
terms
with
the
ghibellini
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
goad
the
podesta
squinted
at
daoud
as
if
to
see
how
serious
his
question
was
this
is
a
guelfo
city
and
normally
i
would
take
that
side
but
i
have
no
personal
feelings
one
way
or
the
other
what
i
do
care
about
is
the
responsibility
i
have
accepted
of
governing
this
city
i
carry
out
that
responsibility
best
by
preserving
it
from
ruin
at
the
same
time
saving
your
own
thought
daoud
biting
your
thumb
at
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
who
has
been
treating
you
like
a
servant
oh
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
want
to
surrender
to
the
but
daoud
was
in
terrible
pain
and
so
tired
that
fatigue
itself
was
now
as
much
a
torment
as
anything
he
had
suffered
earlier
he
longed
to
cut
this
conversation
short
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
me
to
display
my
good
faith
to
the
ghibellini
i
have
decided
to
free
you
why
should
the
ghibellini
care
one
way
or
the
other
what
happens
to
me
said
daoud
slowly
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
to
make
it
easier
to
look
at
pain
flared
in
his
arms
and
legs
in
his
back
and
chest
his
hands
barely
had
the
strength
to
pull
the
blue
cloak
with
him
you
still
deny
that
you
are
of
that
party
asked
i
am
david
of
trebizond
rose
to
answer
a
knock
at
the
door
daoud
lifted
himself
on
one
elbow
to
see
who
it
was
in
the
shadowed
corridor
a
friar
taller
than
was
peering
in
trying
to
see
daoud
we
are
not
quite
ready
for
you
fra
bernardino
said
the
door
wait
signore
the
dominican
said
putting
out
a
pale
hand
cardinal
ugolini
has
come
here
with
and
is
demanding
that
you
release
this
man
david
to
him
at
once
ugolini
here
daoud
felt
a
lightness
in
his
heart
freedom
was
that
much
closer
make
sure
the
cardinal
is
comfortable
and
is
offered
refreshments
fra
bernardino
said
and
tell
him
he
will
not
have
to
wait
long
and
when
the
door
was
shut
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
stared
into
daoud
eyes
if
i
let
you
go
will
you
speak
on
my
behalf
to
the
ghibellini
daoud
smiled
in
my
capacity
as
a
trader
clenched
his
fists
damn
you
you
are
too
stubborn
so
daoud
kept
the
smile
fixed
on
his
face
you
have
arrested
and
tortured
me
for
a
night
and
a
day
you
very
nearly
did
to
me
something
so
horrible
even
now
it
hurts
me
to
think
about
it
and
you
would
have
done
it
too
if
the
contessa
summons
had
not
delayed
you
now
because
you
have
stopped
doing
these
things
to
me
you
expect
me
to
be
overflowing
with
gratitude
and
glad
to
help
you
make
peace
with
the
ghibellini
smiled
back
for
my
sparing
you
from
torture
from
mutilation
from
death
you
should
be
grateful
yes
he
were
another
kind
of
man
he
would
have
destroyed
me
with
greek
fire
and
let
this
city
be
ruined
while
he
fought
the
sienese
in
spite
of
what
he
did
to
me
this
is
a
wise
man
and
he
deserves
to
live
and
to
rule
but
daoud
could
not
resist
another
thrust
what
i
should
do
if
as
you
think
i
have
influence
with
the
sienese
is
have
them
do
to
you
what
you
have
done
to
me
and
not
spare
you
at
the
end
he
felt
himself
getting
angry
as
he
thought
of
all
he
had
been
through
even
though
he
knew
anger
was
foolish
i
know
where
you
keep
your
flask
of
greek
fire
black
eyes
held
daoud
yes
you
could
do
that
but
i
think
i
have
come
to
know
something
about
you
during
these
hours
you
have
suffered
at
my
hands
yes
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
but
i
know
that
you
are
much
more
than
you
seem
to
be
and
you
are
not
the
sort
who
takes
revenge
on
a
man
for
doing
his
duty
daoud
did
not
care
to
haggle
anymore
allow
any
messenger
of
mine
freedom
to
come
and
go
through
the
city
gates
agreed
the
podesta
was
right
he
thought
he
would
not
seek
revenge
after
surrendered
to
the
sienese
any
more
than
he
would
kill
a
prisoner
of
war
men
like
qutuz
did
that
sort
of
thing
to
satisfy
their
vanity
men
like
baibars
did
not
he
thanked
god
for
making
him
more
like
baibars
and
he
thanked
god
for
bringing
him
alive
and
whole
out
of
the
valley
of
death
her
first
sight
of
daoud
was
a
cruel
blow
to
sophia
heart
his
blond
hair
dark
with
dirt
and
sweat
spread
in
lank
locks
on
the
pillow
his
bloodshot
eyes
looked
at
her
out
of
blackened
lids
his
lips
were
cracked
his
face
looked
hollow
as
if
he
had
grown
thinner
just
in
the
day
had
held
him
she
ran
to
him
across
the
tiled
floor
of
ugolini
reception
hall
he
was
alive
but
how
badly
hurt
was
he
she
prayed
that
when
she
lifted
the
blanket
that
covered
him
she
would
see
that
his
body
was
sound
he
raised
his
hands
to
her
as
she
bent
over
the
litter
she
saw
that
the
fingernails
were
blackened
and
bloody
and
her
own
fists
clenched
as
she
felt
what
they
must
have
done
to
his
hands
she
slid
her
arms
around
his
shoulders
and
pressed
her
face
against
his
perhaps
the
and
servants
should
not
see
the
cardinal
niece
embracing
the
trader
from
trebizond
but
at
that
moment
nothing
mattered
to
her
but
to
hold
his
living
body
in
her
arms
she
heard
him
gasp
she
was
hurting
him
what
a
fool
she
was
forgive
my
clumsiness
david
i
am
so
sorry
he
gently
squeezed
her
hand
as
she
drew
away
from
him
your
arms
feel
like
an
angel
wings
ugolini
called
his
steward
agostino
and
rattled
off
a
list
of
necessaries
for
treating
daoud
wounds
water
a
pot
and
a
brazier
clean
cloths
medicine
jars
from
the
cardinal
cabinet
sophia
walked
beside
the
litter
as
ugolini
men
carried
daoud
to
his
room
on
the
third
floor
her
hand
rested
lightly
on
his
shoulder
her
feelings
alternated
between
agony
as
she
imagined
what
he
had
gone
through
and
singing
elation
that
he
was
back
with
her
with
joy
she
felt
movement
and
life
in
the
hard
muscle
under
her
fingertips
tilia
and
i
did
what
we
could
for
you
she
said
when
the
men
had
deposited
him
on
his
bed
i
know
said
daoud
ugolini
told
me
about
your
visit
to
the
contessa
had
she
not
sent
for
when
she
did
as
you
persuaded
her
to
do
i
would
be
dead
now
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
wept
for
joy
it
had
all
meant
something
her
rushing
to
tilia
before
dawn
her
going
with
ugolini
to
the
contessa
her
falling
to
her
knees
before
the
old
woman
as
the
left
ugolini
came
in
with
agostino
and
two
servants
bearing
a
brazier
and
a
tripod
pots
of
water
cloths
and
jars
of
ointments
and
powders
from
ugolini
shelves
two
other
servants
brought
a
table
into
daoud
room
and
ugolini
had
the
medications
arranged
on
it
he
also
let
me
go
because
the
ghibellini
from
siena
are
about
to
besiege
the
city
said
daoud
he
wants
my
help
in
surrendering
to
them
a
pity
the
sienese
could
not
have
gotten
here
in
time
to
catch
the
tartars
and
de
verceuil
said
sophia
when
the
servants
had
left
ugolini
looked
up
from
the
powders
he
was
mixing
for
poultices
and
frowned
catch
them
why
sophia
stared
at
ugolini
then
the
news
had
somehow
missed
him
she
felt
sorry
for
him
even
though
tilia
was
very
much
alive
this
was
going
to
be
a
terrible
shock
daoud
said
in
the
dungeon
i
heard
something
had
happened
at
house
ugolini
eyes
grew
huge
tilia
my
god
what
was
it
tilia
is
well
cardinal
sophia
said
quickly
luckily
for
her
she
was
here
when
it
happened
she
wondered
how
much
daoud
knew
about
what
had
happened
and
how
he
felt
about
it
her
heart
still
ached
for
poor
rachel
where
was
the
child
now
right
at
this
moment
somewhere
on
the
road
to
perugia
being
abused
perhaps
by
that
beast
of
a
tartar
when
happened
ugolini
cried
in
the
name
of
christ
and
the
virgin
speak
out
sophia
told
the
cardinal
and
daoud
how
she
and
tilia
had
gone
to
house
and
of
the
death
and
destruction
they
had
found
there
it
hurt
her
to
see
the
anguish
in
their
eyes
especially
daoud
he
feel
a
terrible
guilt
about
having
sent
rachel
there
in
the
first
place
now
he
had
to
suffer
that
along
with
pain
had
inflicted
on
him
the
tartars
and
de
verceuil
ugolini
shouted
shaking
clenched
fists
may
god
send
a
flood
to
drown
them
on
the
road
to
orvieto
may
all
the
devils
in
hell
roast
them
he
paced
the
floor
furiously
his
red
robes
rustling
i
must
go
to
tilia
at
once
he
cried
no
said
daoud
too
many
people
would
see
you
but
she
has
no
one
to
protect
her
she
has
hired
guards
said
sophia
and
those
who
ruined
her
house
are
gone
daoud
head
fell
back
against
the
pillow
and
his
eyelids
closed
his
face
looked
masklike
to
sophia
almost
as
if
he
were
dead
she
realized
with
sudden
anxiety
that
he
might
be
suffering
terribly
without
complaint
that
would
be
like
him
and
she
and
ugolini
stood
here
talking
she
must
see
to
daoud
hurts
at
once
he
might
have
injuries
within
injuries
from
which
he
could
not
recover
send
some
of
your
trusted
to
protect
tilia
said
daoud
without
opening
his
eyes
his
voice
faint
riccardo
and
some
others
do
not
go
yourself
of
course
said
ugolini
looking
abashed
even
though
you
have
been
tortured
your
head
is
sounder
than
mine
but
you
understand
am
tortured
by
the
thought
of
what
has
happened
to
tilia
i
too
said
daoud
and
to
her
people
and
to
rachel
tomorrow
you
can
tell
me
what
happened
to
you
said
ugolini
at
the
door
i
will
let
you
rest
now
he
drew
a
breath
hesitated
bit
his
lip
sophia
wished
he
would
go
daoud
raised
his
head
and
opened
his
eyes
you
want
to
ask
something
what
is
it
did
you
did
learn
anything
god
willed
that
he
learn
nothing
from
me
said
daoud
sinking
back
again
will
had
something
to
do
with
that
said
sophia
held
out
against
them
what
a
magnificent
but
what
price
had
he
paid
for
his
strength
god
will
is
my
will
daoud
whispered
god
be
with
you
then
said
ugolini
and
left
pulling
the
door
shut
behind
him
daoud
eyes
opened
the
sight
of
his
eyes
woke
a
warmth
in
her
breast
as
if
a
small
sun
had
risen
inside
her
do
you
want
to
sleep
she
asked
him
yes
with
you
beside
me
joy
blazed
up
inside
her
at
those
words
she
had
been
so
afraid
that
torture
would
somehow
destroy
his
caring
for
her
oh
yes
she
said
nothing
would
make
me
happier
but
first
i
need
you
to
wash
and
dress
my
wounds
daoud
gritted
his
teeth
and
winced
as
first
she
lifted
off
the
purple
cloak
that
covered
him
then
inch
by
inch
drew
the
yellow
tunic
up
from
his
body
and
over
his
head
he
groaned
aloud
when
with
her
propping
up
his
heavy
body
he
raised
his
arms
o
kriste
she
whispered
she
wept
anew
as
her
eyes
traveled
over
the
golden
body
she
loved
and
saw
huge
broken
blisters
and
patches
of
red
skin
swollen
black
bruises
the
size
of
hen
eggs
long
deep
lacerations
filled
with
crusted
blood
the
many
little
black
scabs
of
puncture
wounds
when
lorenzo
and
the
ghibellini
get
here
we
will
have
and
his
torturers
torn
to
pieces
she
raged
she
went
to
the
table
folded
a
linen
cloth
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
i
do
not
hate
said
daoud
as
she
began
very
carefully
to
clean
his
wounds
he
has
his
work
and
i
have
mine
as
for
his
torturer
erculio
is
his
name
does
not
know
it
but
his
torturer
is
one
of
us
sophia
hand
moving
the
cloth
lightly
over
a
long
shallow
cut
that
ran
across
the
smooth
almost
hairless
skin
of
his
chest
paused
was
he
delirious
one
of
the
torturer
daoud
looked
amused
i
do
not
know
where
erculio
comes
from
but
he
is
a
good
servant
of
the
god
of
islam
and
of
the
sultan
who
placed
him
there
for
my
protection
for
your
protection
you
mean
he
would
have
killed
you
her
body
turned
to
ice
as
she
faced
the
reality
of
how
close
she
had
come
to
losing
him
yes
said
daoud
i
thought
i
would
never
see
you
again
he
reached
out
his
arms
grimacing
with
pain
she
put
down
the
cloth
and
let
him
hold
her
her
heart
swelled
up
in
her
throat
and
tears
burned
her
eyes
and
suddenly
as
if
a
curtain
were
lifted
she
saw
that
life
with
this
man
would
always
be
this
way
whenever
she
was
with
him
there
would
always
be
a
yesterday
in
which
some
miracle
of
good
fortune
kept
him
alive
there
would
always
be
a
tomorrow
in
which
he
must
face
death
yet
again
her
head
rested
on
his
chest
for
a
moment
then
she
wiped
her
face
and
went
back
to
cleaning
and
covering
his
wounds
never
mind
her
pain
whatever
he
was
feeling
must
be
much
worse
he
told
her
how
to
make
poultices
for
his
burns
using
wet
cloths
and
powdered
medicinal
herbs
ugolini
had
prepared
it
was
like
what
she
had
done
for
his
arrow
wound
only
now
there
were
many
more
hurts
to
treat
silently
in
greek
she
cursed
and
cursed
the
torturer
she
did
not
care
whether
daoud
forgave
them
she
would
never
forgive
what
they
had
done
to
her
man
when
he
was
in
the
cellar
of
the
palazzo
del
podesta
being
tortured
had
he
grieved
at
the
thought
of
losing
her
as
she
had
sorrowed
for
him
she
worked
her
way
down
his
body
from
head
to
foot
tying
the
poultices
in
place
with
strips
of
cloth
thank
god
they
had
done
nothing
to
his
manly
part
that
was
often
the
first
place
a
torturer
went
for
when
would
they
make
love
again
she
wondered
that
depended
on
how
long
it
took
him
to
recover
perhaps
weeks
perhaps
even
months
when
she
was
finished
with
his
front
he
turned
over
with
her
help
again
she
could
not
hold
back
her
tears
pain
not
bodily
but
real
just
the
same
struck
her
at
the
sight
of
his
tormented
flesh
for
a
moment
her
eyes
were
covered
with
darkness
the
skin
of
his
back
and
buttocks
had
been
whipped
away
in
large
red
slashes
she
shook
her
head
violently
spoke
a
few
more
curses
in
her
mind
and
went
to
work
daoud
who
had
endured
most
of
her
healing
efforts
in
silence
cried
out
when
she
put
a
wet
cloth
on
a
torn
spot
what
more
can
you
tell
me
about
rachel
he
asked
she
suspected
he
wanted
to
take
his
mind
off
the
pain
she
repeated
everything
tilia
women
had
reported
ending
that
looking
out
the
windows
they
had
seen
rachel
riding
off
in
a
cart
with
the
old
franciscan
who
interpreted
for
the
tartars
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
old
priest
still
lives
said
daoud
sighing
ah
sophia
rachel
is
a
slave
to
that
tartar
only
because
she
had
the
ill
luck
to
cross
my
path
i
have
brought
destruction
to
many
many
people
slowly
painfully
he
turned
on
his
back
again
with
sophia
helping
lovingly
she
stroked
the
few
patches
of
his
skin
that
were
not
torn
or
burned
or
bruised
when
he
was
settled
he
looked
up
at
her
and
smiled
in
what
she
thought
was
a
strange
way
she
did
not
see
the
cause
of
his
smile
at
first
until
he
looked
down
at
himself
and
she
followed
his
eyes
she
saw
that
his
key
of
life
had
begun
to
raise
itself
daoud
after
all
you
have
been
through
i
want
you
sophia
of
what
i
have
been
through
because
of
what
i
nearly
lost
i
will
tell
you
more
tomorrow
about
what
god
be
thanked
did
not
happen
for
now
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
her
come
to
me
she
understood
he
must
feel
like
a
man
who
had
come
back
from
the
dead
life
was
more
precious
to
him
than
ever
and
love
tired
and
though
he
was
he
wanted
this
moment
of
being
with
her
again
which
must
seem
to
him
like
a
gift
from
god
and
indeed
perhaps
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
he
lay
back
on
the
bed
his
tortured
body
naked
except
for
the
cloth
wrappings
tied
over
the
worst
of
his
wounds
his
beautiful
circumcised
phallos
pulsed
as
it
grew
larger
she
wanted
to
be
naked
with
him
and
she
threw
off
her
outer
tunic
unbelted
her
red
silk
gown
and
pulled
it
over
her
head
her
shift
followed
then
she
stepped
out
of
the
purple
felt
slippers
and
stood
before
him
her
arms
held
away
from
her
body
to
let
him
see
her
she
felt
the
warmth
of
her
own
desire
for
him
spread
through
her
he
said
you
are
a
spring
that
gushes
out
of
barren
rock
i
thirst
for
you
carefully
she
climbed
on
the
bed
straddling
him
slowly
so
as
not
to
hurt
him
she
lowered
herself
over
him
guiding
him
into
her
with
gentle
fingers
a
long
sigh
escaped
him
she
moved
for
both
of
them
the
instant
after
he
groaned
and
reached
his
peak
of
love
and
pleasure
he
fell
asleep
still
lying
on
his
back
he
had
just
enough
strength
to
couple
with
me
she
thought
she
rose
from
him
and
blew
out
the
candles
on
the
bedside
table
the
night
was
cool
and
she
closed
the
casement
windows
of
his
room
there
was
space
between
daoud
and
the
wall
for
her
to
lie
beside
him
she
stretched
out
there
and
stayed
awake
only
long
enough
to
kiss
his
bare
shoulder
forcing
himself
to
wake
up
seemed
as
much
torture
for
daoud
as
anything
erculio
had
done
to
him
he
could
only
lie
there
and
struggle
against
the
agony
he
felt
in
every
part
of
his
body
his
head
ached
his
tongue
felt
like
a
lump
of
dried
camel
dung
his
throbbing
muscles
and
bones
begged
him
to
sink
back
into
unconsciousness
how
long
had
he
slept
only
an
hour
or
two
he
was
sure
the
yellow
glow
of
a
lighted
candle
filled
the
room
lorenzo
was
standing
near
the
bed
holding
the
candle
glowering
at
daoud
from
under
thick
dark
brows
as
if
he
were
angry
at
him
daoud
wanted
to
laugh
and
leap
out
of
bed
and
throw
his
arms
around
lorenzo
he
managed
only
to
sit
up
too
quickly
fires
shot
from
his
joints
into
his
neck
to
coalesce
in
a
burst
of
agony
in
the
back
of
his
head
he
did
not
want
to
cry
out
in
front
of
lorenzo
but
a
groan
forced
itself
through
his
cracked
lips
sophia
wearing
her
red
silk
gown
and
standing
by
the
bed
did
she
get
out
of
bed
and
dressed
before
lorenzo
got
in
here
took
shoulders
gently
and
lowered
him
back
to
the
bed
lorenzo
set
the
candle
on
the
table
beside
daoud
and
sat
beside
him
what
the
devil
did
those
bastards
do
to
you
daoud
saw
the
rage
in
the
penetrating
dark
eyes
and
it
delighted
him
because
lorenzo
was
furious
for
his
sake
nothing
that
i
will
not
recover
from
more
quickly
now
that
i
see
your
infidel
face
have
you
come
here
to
parley
with
the
podesta
yes
duke
rinaldo
has
sent
his
son
lapo
and
me
to
meet
with
here
at
ugolini
lorenzo
had
accomplished
everything
daoud
asked
of
him
and
more
his
timely
arrival
had
saved
daoud
life
to
think
that
daoud
had
once
wanted
to
be
rid
of
him
except
for
sophia
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
so
happy
to
see
anyone
as
this
grizzled
sicilian
sophia
said
i
have
tended
your
wounds
enough
for
tonight
david
i
leave
you
in
lorenzo
care
she
smiled
at
lorenzo
and
put
her
hand
briefly
on
his
shoulder
as
she
went
to
the
door
lorenzo
scooped
something
from
the
floor
jumped
up
and
handed
it
to
her
i
believe
this
is
yours
madonna
he
held
out
her
red
leather
belt
sophia
swept
it
from
his
hand
thank
you
messere
she
said
coolly
good
night
sophia
said
daoud
with
a
smile
you
have
brought
me
great
comfort
tonight
good
night
david
she
said
and
shot
him
a
burning
look
that
he
hoped
lorenzo
did
not
see
after
the
door
closed
behind
her
lorenzo
chuckled
softly
as
he
sat
down
again
tending
your
wounds
with
her
gown
off
was
she
and
no
light
in
the
room
till
i
brought
this
candle
in
you
and
she
are
not
as
discreet
as
you
were
before
i
left
could
never
fool
thought
daoud
ruefully
the
pope
is
gone
the
tartars
are
gone
the
french
are
gone
said
daoud
there
is
no
one
left
in
orvieto
that
we
need
deceive
find
some
soft
cloths
on
the
table
to
bind
my
feet
creating
the
barrier
between
his
mind
and
the
pain
daoud
swung
his
legs
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
lorenzo
stared
at
him
his
mouth
falling
open
what
in
the
name
of
hell
are
you
doing
you
can
not
get
up
what
wounds
are
under
those
bandages
i
do
not
mind
the
pain
said
daoud
i
want
to
meet
this
duke
son
where
is
your
army
camped
lorenzo
grin
stretched
his
thick
black
mustache
in
the
valley
to
the
north
you
should
see
it
after
i
climbed
up
to
the
main
gate
of
orvieto
i
looked
down
and
saw
the
hundreds
of
campfires
twinkling
it
was
as
if
the
world
had
turned
over
and
i
was
looking
down
into
the
starry
sky
daoud
wished
he
could
go
to
the
city
walls
to
see
what
lorenzo
had
described
but
he
had
barely
strength
enough
to
walk
from
his
room
to
ugolini
cabinet
four
men
daoud
lorenzo
ugolini
and
lapo
di
stefano
sat
around
ugolini
worktable
discussing
the
fate
of
orvieto
the
servants
had
moved
the
table
to
the
center
of
the
cabinet
and
had
replaced
the
cardinal
usual
clutter
of
philosophical
instruments
with
platters
of
meat
loaves
of
bread
baked
fresh
in
the
cardinal
kitchen
and
trays
of
steaming
pastries
daoud
had
no
appetite
and
was
in
too
much
pain
to
eat
when
does
your
king
manfred
intend
to
come
up
from
the
south
lapo
asked
daoud
he
twisted
the
carcass
of
a
roasted
pigeon
between
thick
fingers
his
nose
had
been
broken
in
some
accident
or
fight
air
whistled
in
and
out
of
the
flattened
nostrils
daoud
judged
him
to
be
about
twenty
the
same
age
as
simon
de
gobignon
as
far
as
lapo
knew
daoud
was
an
agent
of
the
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
it
might
have
shocked
him
to
discover
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
muslim
from
egypt
daoud
had
to
evade
lapo
question
he
had
no
idea
what
plans
manfred
had
if
any
he
could
only
hope
that
when
he
met
with
manfred
at
lucera
he
would
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
invade
the
papal
states
king
manfred
would
come
from
the
south
much
more
quickly
daoud
said
if
he
could
count
on
being
recognized
by
the
cities
of
the
north
as
king
of
a
united
italy
that
must
be
between
my
father
and
him
said
lapo
and
his
breath
wheezed
through
his
nostrils
as
he
bit
into
the
pigeon
breast
after
all
no
such
title
exists
there
has
never
been
a
king
of
italy
and
yet
there
easily
could
be
thought
daoud
seeing
the
shape
of
the
peninsula
in
his
mind
and
if
that
single
ruler
were
a
man
like
manfred
what
a
strong
barrier
italy
could
be
between
the
abode
of
islam
and
the
barbaric
kingdoms
of
christian
europe
but
in
fact
thought
daoud
for
all
that
lapo
di
stefano
wore
the
ghibellino
symbol
the
black
hohenstaufen
eagle
on
the
breast
of
his
red
silk
surcoat
he
and
his
father
might
still
prefer
that
manfred
stay
where
he
was
as
long
as
manfred
remained
cut
off
from
the
northern
cities
like
siena
by
the
band
of
the
papal
states
running
across
the
center
of
italy
the
ghibellini
of
the
north
could
do
as
they
pleased
when
the
french
invade
said
daoud
a
united
italy
can
keep
them
out
if
the
cities
of
the
north
are
divided
the
french
will
take
them
over
one
by
one
how
do
you
know
the
french
will
invade
lapo
asked
we
have
heard
that
king
louis
has
no
desire
to
wage
war
in
italy
daoud
was
beginning
to
feel
a
strong
dislike
for
this
coarse
young
nobleman
who
seemed
both
very
sure
of
himself
and
very
ignorant
he
was
about
to
reply
when
a
entered
and
whispered
to
ugolini
is
here
ugolini
said
have
him
wait
below
until
we
send
for
him
said
daoud
quickly
he
turned
back
to
lapo
i
do
not
wish
harmed
lapo
stared
coldly
at
daoud
who
are
you
to
give
orders
lorenzo
answered
before
daoud
could
speak
let
me
remind
you
signore
that
it
was
david
of
trebizond
whose
gold
made
possible
your
capture
of
orvieto
there
was
too
much
conflict
building
up
here
daoud
thought
no
lorenzo
siena
had
the
will
the
fighting
spirit
that
was
what
made
this
victory
possible
i
contributed
only
money
he
turned
to
lapo
i
do
not
give
orders
i
make
recommendations
based
on
my
knowledge
of
this
town
i
recommend
that
continue
as
podesta
if
you
leave
enough
men
under
his
command
he
will
keep
the
feuding
families
under
control
orvieto
will
prosper
and
pay
you
tribute
that
will
make
this
expedition
worth
your
while
the
army
of
siena
has
marched
against
orvieto
because
orvieto
is
a
guelfo
stronghold
said
lapo
we
intend
to
replace
the
governments
of
all
the
cities
near
siena
with
rulers
favorable
to
us
daoud
thought
he
understood
lapo
gauging
him
as
a
man
who
had
little
experience
of
war
but
who
enjoyed
bloodletting
he
was
probably
disappointed
that
the
city
might
surrender
without
a
battle
without
an
excuse
for
looting
and
massacre
he
might
be
hoping
as
a
substitute
to
find
someone
who
could
be
put
to
death
publicly
in
some
hideous
way
to
demonstrate
his
power
over
the
city
of
course
you
have
come
here
to
impose
your
will
on
orvieto
he
said
quietly
but
be
grateful
that
you
do
not
have
to
fight
your
way
up
the
mountain
if
were
to
choose
to
resist
your
army
would
be
months
taking
orvieto
let
us
be
glad
the
podesta
was
sensible
and
surrendered
orvieto
is
a
beautiful
city
its
people
will
be
eager
to
show
their
gratitude
to
a
conqueror
gracious
to
them
the
ease
with
which
you
win
their
hearts
will
in
turn
impress
your
own
sienese
people
with
your
statesmanship
of
course
orvieto
was
richer
when
the
pope
and
most
of
the
cardinals
were
here
a
pity
you
could
not
have
marched
your
army
here
sooner
would
have
been
easier
on
me
lapo
thick
eyebrows
went
up
i
heard
that
you
were
tortured
by
this
podesta
and
i
can
see
you
have
been
badly
hurt
you
want
no
revenge
daoud
fixed
lapo
with
a
hard
look
and
slowly
shook
his
head
revenge
does
not
interest
me
just
what
does
interest
you
messer
trader
the
heir
of
siena
glowered
at
daoud
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
i
do
not
trust
a
man
who
does
not
care
about
revenge
revenge
was
not
his
presence
at
the
heart
of
christendom
a
kind
of
revenge
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
of
christian
invasions
of
muslim
lands
did
it
not
make
revenge
all
the
sweeter
that
god
chosen
instrument
was
a
descendant
of
those
very
crusaders
who
had
been
sent
against
islam
this
dense
young
nobleman
could
not
conceive
of
the
fantastic
forms
revenge
could
take
i
act
in
the
interests
of
king
manfred
daoud
said
it
is
in
his
interest
that
orvieto
be
part
of
the
chain
of
ghibellino
cities
in
the
north
that
limit
the
power
of
the
pope
it
is
not
in
his
interest
or
yours
that
siena
waste
lives
and
money
capturing
orvieto
the
town
can
be
taken
without
a
struggle
if
you
come
to
terms
with
and
i
recommend
that
you
leave
him
in
place
as
podesta
of
orvieto
lapo
shook
his
head
how
can
i
trust
a
man
who
would
betray
his
own
city
daoud
felt
his
small
remaining
store
of
strength
ebbing
fast
he
must
finish
this
quickly
you
will
leave
your
own
force
here
to
keep
him
in
line
of
course
you
will
take
prominent
orvietans
back
to
siena
with
you
as
hostages
but
you
should
understand
that
is
not
betraying
his
city
he
is
willing
to
surrender
because
he
knows
that
is
best
for
orvieto
give
him
a
free
hand
and
strengthen
his
militia
and
he
will
govern
the
town
well
for
you
lorenzo
said
dryly
this
paragon
of
podestas
waits
in
cardinal
ugolini
reception
hall
to
offer
you
the
keys
to
the
city
of
orvieto
shall
we
invite
him
to
join
us
your
signory
lapo
di
stefano
shrugged
and
waved
a
greasy
hand
send
for
the
fellow
i
will
make
my
decision
after
i
have
seen
him
he
picked
up
another
roasted
pigeon
and
sank
his
teeth
into
it
and
life
or
death
for
hundreds
of
people
depended
on
how
this
ape
happened
to
choose
in
the
next
few
moments
daoud
thought
as
lorenzo
went
to
the
door
and
called
a
servant
why
did
god
put
such
men
in
positions
of
power
soon
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
lorenzo
went
to
it
and
admitted
the
podesta
face
was
hidden
by
the
dark
brown
hood
of
his
cloak
all
this
man
knows
i
plan
to
have
him
daoud
thought
admiring
courage
in
coming
here
you
come
recommended
to
us
as
a
man
who
can
keep
order
in
this
city
said
lapo
as
took
a
seat
and
we
can
think
of
no
higher
recommendation
since
it
comes
from
a
man
you
have
just
been
torturing
said
lorenzo
this
man
has
the
strength
of
the
old
romans
said
nodding
toward
daoud
he
knows
when
to
put
a
personal
grievance
aside
for
the
greater
good
lapo
said
if
we
were
willing
to
let
you
remain
as
podesta
of
this
city
in
return
for
your
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
duke
of
siena
how
many
men
would
you
need
to
keep
the
city
under
control
with
two
hundred
men
i
could
match
the
monaldeschi
forces
said
the
filippeschi
have
been
crushed
and
so
badly
that
they
may
go
over
to
the
ghibellino
party
his
dark
eyes
lit
up
he
was
relishing
the
prospect
of
giving
orders
daoud
thought
to
the
old
houses
that
had
treated
him
like
a
servant
it
be
that
my
legacy
to
orvieto
may
be
an
improved
government
i
certainly
did
not
come
here
for
that
but
daoud
felt
himself
weakening
his
overtaxed
body
would
soon
betray
him
into
sleep
if
he
did
not
go
to
bed
of
his
own
accord
if
you
have
no
further
need
of
me
he
said
lorenzo
helped
him
stand
and
leaning
on
him
he
limped
to
the
door
i
owe
you
more
than
i
can
say
called
after
him
pray
to
god
that
i
do
not
decide
to
repay
my
debt
to
daoud
answered
he
did
not
look
back
but
he
could
imagine
small
grim
smile
lvii
simon
and
king
louis
stood
side
by
side
on
the
yellow
sandy
west
bank
of
the
rhone
river
opposite
avignon
they
had
just
crossed
over
the
pont
a
long
narrow
bridge
of
arches
avignon
was
a
compact
city
encircled
by
walls
fortified
with
red
towers
a
prosperous
city
as
well
simon
thought
as
he
regarded
the
many
church
spires
rising
above
the
walls
even
during
his
brief
glimpse
of
the
city
upon
his
arrival
late
the
night
before
he
had
seen
many
great
houses
he
looked
at
the
tall
gaunt
king
whose
round
eyes
stared
thoughtfully
off
into
the
cloudy
sky
it
was
lucky
for
simon
if
it
were
proper
to
think
of
a
man
death
as
lucky
that
the
funeral
of
count
raymond
of
provence
father
of
queen
marguerite
had
brought
the
king
here
so
close
to
italy
otherwise
simon
might
still
be
traveling
northward
with
the
letter
when
he
landed
at
he
had
found
the
whole
port
abuzz
with
the
news
of
count
raymond
death
and
of
the
coming
of
the
french
royal
family
to
bury
him
in
state
and
settle
the
future
of
the
county
of
provence
a
traveler
from
a
foreign
land
looking
at
louis
would
never
imagine
that
he
was
a
king
simon
thought
a
plain
brown
felt
cap
covered
thinning
gray
hair
draping
down
one
side
of
his
head
his
robe
and
a
cloak
of
thin
cheap
wool
dyed
black
were
not
warm
enough
for
this
chill
september
morning
perhaps
simon
thought
the
penitential
shirt
of
woven
horsehair
he
wore
next
to
his
skin
warmed
louis
even
as
it
discomforted
him
he
carried
no
weapon
at
his
dull
leather
belt
only
the
parchment
scroll
the
pope
letter
which
simon
had
given
him
the
night
before
louis
shoes
were
of
the
same
sort
of
leather
as
his
belt
and
the
points
of
their
toes
were
far
too
short
to
be
fashionable
simon
felt
overdressed
beside
the
king
and
resolved
that
from
now
on
he
would
try
to
dress
more
plainly
with
his
long
fingers
king
louis
tapped
the
scroll
tucked
into
his
belt
he
afflicts
me
sorely
this
jacques
pantaleone
this
pope
urban
the
pope
afflicts
you
sire
simon
was
surprised
to
see
the
king
unhappy
about
the
pope
message
to
him
he
had
expected
louis
to
be
overjoyed
at
getting
permission
to
deal
with
the
tartars
a
sudden
worry
struck
him
what
if
the
king
and
the
pope
could
not
agree
all
his
work
would
have
been
for
nothing
over
a
year
of
his
life
all
the
fighting
and
dying
to
say
nothing
of
the
personal
expense
of
paying
forty
venetian
crossbowmen
for
over
a
year
and
maintaining
six
knights
now
five
a
thought
reminded
him
yes
and
what
about
alain
was
his
death
to
be
for
nothing
worst
of
all
the
accomplishment
he
had
hoped
would
put
him
on
the
road
to
redeeming
his
family
honor
would
be
no
accomplishment
at
all
the
year
wasted
lives
wasted
the
shadow
of
treason
still
lying
upon
his
name
and
title
what
joy
he
had
felt
only
a
little
earlier
this
morning
knowing
he
would
accompany
king
louis
on
his
morning
walk
after
mass
now
his
eager
anticipation
seemed
like
so
much
foolishness
of
all
the
men
in
the
world
this
is
the
one
i
would
never
want
to
whatever
louis
decided
be
right
but
dear
god
let
him
not
decide
to
cast
away
the
alliance
louis
said
urban
grants
the
thing
i
want
most
in
the
world
but
only
if
i
agree
to
that
which
i
desire
least
and
i
do
not
want
to
give
in
to
him
god
the
sky
seemed
to
darken
what
does
he
ask
you
to
do
sire
louis
sighed
a
deep
tremulous
expulsion
of
breath
he
asks
that
the
might
of
france
should
be
diverted
into
a
squabble
among
petty
princes
in
italy
when
jerusalem
is
at
stake
seems
more
than
a
squabble
when
you
are
in
the
thick
of
thought
simon
remembering
the
night
the
filippeschi
had
attacked
the
monaldeschi
palace
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
to
begin
preparing
for
a
crusade
louis
said
i
want
to
return
to
outremer
in
six
years
in
that
may
seem
to
you
a
long
time
away
but
for
such
a
great
undertaking
as
this
it
is
barely
enough
it
took
me
four
years
to
get
ready
for
the
last
crusade
to
gather
the
men
and
supplies
and
it
will
be
harder
this
time
why
sire
said
simon
louis
head
drooped
and
his
eyes
fell
to
win
my
freedom
i
promised
baibars
the
mameluke
leader
who
is
now
sultan
of
cairo
that
i
would
not
wage
war
on
islam
for
twenty
years
an
oath
to
an
unbeliever
said
simon
my
royal
word
said
louis
fiercely
and
besides
that
france
needed
twenty
years
to
recover
from
the
loss
of
thousands
of
men
men
lost
to
raise
up
a
new
generation
of
knights
like
yourself
to
take
the
cross
again
many
times
during
his
boyhood
years
of
living
with
the
royal
family
simon
had
observed
that
the
queen
or
the
king
brothers
or
his
sons
would
burst
out
in
exasperation
over
louis
insistence
on
adherence
to
some
principle
regardless
of
inconvenience
or
discomfort
in
eyes
this
had
always
meant
that
the
king
was
a
better
christian
than
the
other
members
of
his
family
now
seeing
all
his
work
and
his
hopes
possibly
ruined
by
the
king
refusal
to
come
to
the
pope
aid
against
the
ghibellini
simon
was
disturbed
to
feel
a
similar
anger
at
louis
arise
within
him
simon
stared
at
the
man
he
loved
so
well
and
saw
that
even
though
the
king
was
talking
of
war
his
thin
pale
face
was
raised
to
heaven
in
an
exalted
almost
angelic
look
but
only
the
pope
can
proclaim
a
crusade
louis
said
unless
he
does
so
i
can
not
raise
an
army
and
if
we
attack
the
saracens
in
egypt
while
the
tartars
strike
through
syria
we
will
be
invincible
but
without
the
pope
permission
i
can
not
make
a
pact
with
the
tartars
in
this
letter
he
gives
that
permission
but
he
makes
it
conditional
on
my
involving
france
in
his
struggle
with
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
simon
was
in
despair
louis
would
refuse
and
the
alliance
would
go
louis
put
a
hand
on
simon
shoulder
be
patient
awhile
simon
my
queen
and
my
brother
count
charles
will
join
us
at
breakfast
we
will
talk
together
of
all
this
the
weight
of
louis
hand
sent
a
warmth
all
through
him
but
how
could
the
king
expect
him
to
be
patient
when
he
had
so
much
to
lose
count
charles
meets
with
you
this
morning
simon
asked
he
had
known
that
charles
was
in
avignon
but
thought
it
his
duty
to
carry
the
pope
letter
straight
to
the
king
without
first
taking
the
time
to
seek
out
his
mentor
the
king
brother
yes
sighed
louis
we
meet
for
another
petty
squabble
my
queen
was
the
only
heir
of
her
father
the
count
of
provence
and
now
the
county
is
ours
to
dispose
of
marguerite
wants
to
keep
it
in
my
immediate
family
giving
it
to
our
son
tristan
but
charles
wants
it
for
himself
he
already
holds
anjou
aquitaine
and
arles
add
provence
to
that
and
he
would
have
a
domain
stretching
from
the
pyrenees
to
italy
whatever
i
decide
i
will
offend
either
my
brother
or
my
wife
he
shook
his
head
that
is
why
it
makes
me
so
happy
to
talk
to
you
simon
young
men
understand
what
is
really
important
so
much
better
than
their
elders
sire
i
would
do
anything
you
asked
of
me
on
a
sudden
impulse
simon
fell
to
his
knees
on
the
sand
and
seized
louis
bony
hand
and
kissed
it
louis
gripped
his
arms
and
raised
him
simon
felt
surprising
strength
in
louis
hands
do
not
kneel
to
me
simon
said
the
king
and
simon
saw
that
his
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
but
it
would
mean
so
much
to
me
if
you
of
all
men
would
take
the
cross
i
of
all
men
simon
understood
louis
was
thinking
of
amalric
de
gobignon
whose
treachery
fourteen
years
earlier
had
been
the
final
blow
to
crusade
into
egypt
the
king
life
had
been
shadowed
ever
since
simon
knew
by
the
memory
of
an
entire
army
lost
in
the
sands
by
the
nile
and
by
his
failure
to
win
jerusalem
no
matter
that
i
am
not
really
the
son
of
amalric
if
i
inherited
his
title
his
lands
and
his
power
i
must
inherit
his
shame
too
and
atone
for
louis
was
still
holding
simon
arms
the
light
blue
eyes
froze
him
with
their
stare
i
have
sworn
to
liberate
jerusalem
i
will
do
it
or
i
will
die
if
i
can
not
have
the
help
of
the
tartars
i
will
still
go
if
every
knight
and
in
christendom
refused
to
go
with
me
if
i
had
to
go
alone
i
would
still
go
help
me
you
will
never
have
to
go
alone
as
long
as
i
live
if
you
go
on
crusade
i
will
go
there
must
be
a
tartar
alliance
there
must
let
us
walk
back
over
to
the
city
and
to
breakfast
simon
said
louis
marguerite
and
charles
will
be
waiting
for
us
as
they
walked
to
the
bridge
of
avignon
preceded
and
followed
at
a
discreet
distance
by
the
king
guards
in
blue
and
silver
tunics
simon
felt
himself
torn
he
wanted
to
please
king
louis
and
he
wanted
to
redeem
the
name
of
his
house
but
must
he
live
out
his
whole
life
expiating
the
crimes
of
amalric
de
gobignon
who
was
not
even
his
real
father
and
nicolette
laid
a
heavy
burden
on
me
when
they
brought
me
into
the
he
thought
bitterly
again
he
thought
of
sophia
if
he
could
persuade
her
to
come
and
dwell
with
him
at
gobignon
he
could
forget
the
shame
of
amalric
and
live
simply
and
in
peace
a
happy
man
since
high
matters
of
state
were
to
be
discussed
here
over
breakfast
in
the
private
dining
room
of
the
palace
of
the
bishop
of
avignon
the
servants
had
been
dismissed
king
louis
queen
marguerite
prince
tristan
count
charles
and
simon
were
alone
together
the
large
round
table
was
piled
high
a
whole
roast
duck
a
dozen
boiled
eels
blocks
of
hard
cheese
a
pyramid
of
eggs
bowls
of
pickled
fruits
stacked
loaves
of
fine
white
bread
trays
of
cheese
pastries
and
flagons
of
wine
simon
sliced
the
eels
and
put
oval
white
slices
on
each
trencher
while
prince
tristan
carved
and
distributed
the
duck
as
they
did
so
king
louis
read
aloud
the
pope
letter
granting
him
permission
to
conduct
a
crusade
jointly
with
the
tartars
in
return
for
french
help
against
the
ghibellini
your
next
crusade
will
make
me
a
widow
queen
marguerite
said
her
round
face
white
and
her
fists
clenched
on
the
table
as
your
last
did
to
so
many
other
women
tristan
a
sturdy
youth
a
few
years
younger
than
simon
went
around
the
table
pouring
red
rhone
valley
wine
into
everyone
cup
but
his
father
louis
poured
his
own
wine
from
another
pitcher
and
simon
saw
that
it
was
a
pale
pink
it
must
be
more
water
than
wine
louis
long
thin
fingers
carrying
a
slice
of
eel
to
his
mouth
as
marguerite
spoke
stopped
in
midair
and
he
slowly
put
the
meat
back
on
his
trencher
but
he
said
nothing
do
not
speak
so
madame
said
charles
as
he
used
a
long
thumbnail
darkened
by
the
dirt
under
it
to
break
and
peel
the
shell
from
a
egg
it
brings
ill
luck
simon
heard
the
venomous
undertone
in
his
voice
even
though
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
seen
each
other
since
charles
sent
simon
to
italy
to
guard
the
tartars
the
count
of
anjou
had
hardly
spoken
to
simon
this
morning
hurt
simon
wondered
how
he
had
offended
charles
marguerite
tall
and
stout
her
head
wrapped
in
a
linen
coif
held
in
place
with
a
net
of
pearls
stood
with
a
sudden
graceless
lunge
that
knocked
her
chair
over
tristan
blushing
went
to
pick
it
up
and
she
caught
his
hand
what
need
of
ill
luck
when
i
have
a
husband
bent
on
destroying
himself
and
he
has
a
brother
who
is
only
too
happy
to
help
him
do
it
she
turned
away
from
the
table
pulling
tristan
after
her
i
take
with
me
this
boy
lest
he
spoil
your
pleasant
dreams
of
crusading
by
reminding
you
of
how
and
where
he
was
born
with
long
angry
strides
she
was
at
the
door
tristan
stepped
in
front
of
his
mother
to
open
the
door
for
her
good
morning
to
you
madame
said
louis
softly
still
looking
down
at
the
slices
of
boiled
eel
that
lay
before
him
the
door
slammed
behind
the
queen
and
her
son
what
did
she
mean
by
that
charles
said
sounding
quite
unconcerned
by
the
queen
outburst
do
you
not
remember
brother
said
louis
marguerite
gave
birth
to
tristan
alone
in
egypt
while
you
and
i
were
prisoners
of
the
mamelukes
she
has
never
forgotten
how
terrified
she
was
to
mask
his
embarrassment
simon
took
a
big
swallow
of
the
red
wine
it
was
thick
and
tart
and
burned
in
his
chest
as
it
went
down
he
never
enjoyed
wine
this
early
in
the
day
he
wished
he
could
drink
heavily
watered
wine
as
king
louis
did
but
he
feared
people
like
uncle
charles
would
think
him
a
weakling
charles
popped
the
entire
egg
into
his
mouth
and
spoke
around
it
it
is
best
that
the
queen
has
left
us
i
do
not
understand
why
she
dislikes
me
so
i
do
not
understand
why
you
and
she
dislike
each
other
said
louis
sadly
we
will
talk
of
that
another
time
charles
picked
up
the
scroll
of
the
pope
letter
and
shook
it
at
louis
you
must
let
me
go
to
the
aid
of
the
holy
father
charles
fingernails
were
quite
long
simon
knew
because
he
never
bothered
to
trim
them
his
hair
and
stubble
of
beard
were
thick
and
pure
black
while
louis
face
was
smooth
and
his
hair
what
was
left
of
it
was
a
silvery
gray
charles
was
and
sat
erect
louis
was
slender
of
frame
and
slightly
stooped
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
two
such
men
were
brothers
but
they
did
both
have
what
were
said
to
be
the
capet
family
features
they
were
very
tall
with
long
faces
large
noses
and
round
staring
eyes
louis
blue
and
charles
brown
they
both
dressed
plainly
but
charles
dressed
like
a
fighting
man
in
leather
jerkin
and
high
boots
that
he
stretched
out
before
him
as
he
sat
sideways
to
the
table
simon
used
his
dagger
to
cut
himself
a
chunk
of
white
bread
baked
before
dawn
in
the
bishop
of
avignon
ovens
from
one
of
the
loaves
in
the
center
of
the
table
he
hoped
it
would
soak
up
the
wine
that
still
smoldered
in
his
stomach
louis
said
all
my
life
people
have
been
trying
to
get
me
to
make
war
on
the
hohenstaufen
family
our
mother
may
she
rest
in
peace
one
pope
after
another
now
you
all
call
the
hohenstaufen
mortal
enemies
of
christendom
i
am
still
not
persuaded
charles
laughed
scornfully
brother
who
do
you
think
incited
the
sienese
to
take
orvieto
and
in
this
letter
his
holiness
says
manfred
is
preparing
to
march
north
against
him
simon
wondered
if
sophia
was
still
in
orvieto
ever
since
he
had
heard
the
news
that
a
ghibellino
army
had
captured
the
city
on
the
rock
apparently
without
a
battle
worries
about
sophia
safety
had
gnawed
at
him
he
wished
desperately
that
he
could
be
wherever
she
was
to
protect
her
and
how
he
longed
just
to
see
her
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
to
kiss
her
beautiful
golden
face
to
taste
her
lips
the
color
of
sweet
red
grapes
louis
said
manfred
is
only
trying
to
protect
his
crown
which
the
pope
wants
you
to
take
from
him
simon
prayed
that
charles
would
persuade
louis
but
he
had
little
hope
of
it
he
had
many
times
seen
the
king
his
mind
made
up
gently
obstinate
never
raising
his
voice
never
losing
his
patience
withstanding
the
arguments
of
his
whole
family
and
court
then
simon
listening
to
the
argument
became
aware
of
something
he
had
not
noticed
earlier
neither
of
the
royal
brothers
had
mentioned
the
pope
poor
health
probably
because
neither
of
them
had
seen
for
himself
how
sick
pope
urban
was
he
waited
for
a
pause
then
spoke
sire
uncle
charles
the
holy
father
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
gravely
ill
by
the
time
i
left
him
he
told
me
that
he
expects
to
die
soon
if
he
does
die
now
will
not
this
permission
for
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
die
with
him
simon
pointed
to
the
letter
yes
it
will
said
louis
frowning
we
will
have
to
start
all
over
again
with
the
next
pope
manfred
could
try
to
influence
the
election
of
the
pope
said
simon
urgently
or
he
could
try
to
control
the
next
pope
by
taking
him
captive
louis
rubbed
his
high
forehead
it
has
been
done
before
more
than
once
charles
large
hairy
hand
clamped
down
on
louis
forearm
simon
has
hit
upon
the
key
to
all
this
brother
think
how
powerful
the
ghibellini
are
in
italy
now
they
control
florence
siena
pisa
lucca
and
now
orvieto
with
all
those
ghibellino
cities
to
the
north
of
the
papal
states
and
manfred
to
the
south
is
it
not
obvious
what
manfred
is
planning
charles
struck
louis
arm
again
and
again
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
to
emphasize
his
point
no
one
else
would
dare
touch
the
king
like
that
thought
simon
obvious
to
you
perhaps
said
louis
wryly
i
see
only
a
man
trying
to
protect
himself
the
instant
pope
urban
dies
manfred
and
his
allies
will
attack
he
will
surround
and
seize
the
entire
college
of
cardinals
he
will
force
them
to
elect
the
pope
of
his
choice
we
will
lose
the
papacy
we
do
not
the
papacy
charles
leaned
back
laughing
without
mirth
well
manfred
will
own
the
papacy
if
we
do
not
stop
him
and
then
you
can
forget
about
your
tartar
alliance
you
can
probably
forget
about
crusading
altogether
a
pope
controlled
by
the
hohenstaufen
would
probably
forbid
you
to
crusade
under
pain
of
excommunication
do
not
forget
it
was
manfred
father
emperor
frederic
who
made
a
treaty
with
the
sultan
of
cairo
simon
watched
louis
closely
to
see
what
effect
charles
words
were
having
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
sinking
in
a
troubled
frown
drew
louis
pale
brows
together
and
tightened
his
mouth
simon
heart
began
to
beat
faster
as
his
hopes
rose
charles
went
on
if
i
go
now
i
go
at
the
pope
invitation
and
if
urban
dies
louis
made
a
reverent
sign
of
the
cross
if
it
be
god
will
charles
yes
yes
if
it
be
god
will
that
this
pope
dies
i
will
already
be
in
italy
charles
said
i
can
be
in
rome
athwart
manfred
path
and
he
will
not
be
able
to
intimidate
the
college
of
cardinals
when
they
elect
the
next
pope
you
must
let
me
go
into
italy
to
protect
our
interests
or
else
give
up
your
dream
of
jerusalem
a
long
moment
of
silence
passed
louis
staring
into
charles
eyes
louis
held
up
a
finger
i
will
not
declare
war
on
manfred
if
you
go
this
is
entirely
your
doing
and
that
of
the
pope
won
the
king
has
given
in
simon
wild
with
joy
inside
forced
himself
to
sit
silent
charles
did
not
look
as
pleased
as
simon
felt
but
if
you
declare
war
where
will
i
get
the
knights
and
men
louis
held
up
a
second
finger
you
will
get
them
yourself
i
will
not
provide
them
you
will
have
to
hire
them
and
if
manfred
beats
your
army
i
will
not
send
more
men
to
rescue
you
charles
shrugged
well
i
have
the
best
tax
collectors
in
europe
louis
raised
a
third
finger
you
will
forget
about
provence
charles
looked
outraged
forget
about
he
sputtered
louis
raised
a
finger
charles
i
will
not
let
you
have
both
sicily
and
provence
you
want
too
much
charles
sighed
very
well
let
provence
go
to
tristan
you
have
put
me
in
a
position
where
i
will
desperately
need
the
taxes
provence
would
yield
but
i
will
make
do
somehow
i
am
sure
you
will
said
louis
if
you
have
to
sell
all
the
clothes
from
all
the
backs
in
the
lands
you
now
rule
louis
thought
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
simon
who
glowing
inwardly
leapt
to
his
feet
yes
sire
louis
looked
startled
at
simon
vehemence
i
will
write
two
letters
for
you
to
take
to
perugia
one
for
the
reigning
pope
who
i
pray
will
still
be
pope
urban
in
that
i
will
give
my
permission
for
the
count
of
anjou
to
accept
the
crown
the
pope
has
offered
him
and
to
make
war
on
manfred
he
stopped
sighed
and
shook
his
head
turning
to
his
brother
he
said
i
do
this
with
great
sorrow
and
misgiving
charles
but
i
fear
i
have
no
choice
the
count
of
anjou
said
nothing
but
simon
saw
his
chest
rapidly
rising
and
falling
with
excitement
should
god
take
pope
urban
simon
you
will
hold
the
letter
sealed
until
a
new
pope
is
elected
and
then
give
it
to
him
the
other
letter
in
the
event
pope
urban
dies
will
be
for
cardinal
de
verceuil
you
mentioned
that
manfred
might
try
to
influence
the
election
of
the
next
pope
fourteen
out
of
cardinals
are
french
and
if
they
vote
together
they
can
elect
a
pope
i
shall
recommend
a
candidate
they
can
unite
behind
again
i
do
not
like
to
do
this
because
a
king
should
not
interfere
in
the
election
of
a
pope
should
pope
urban
live
to
read
the
first
letter
you
will
not
give
the
second
letter
to
cardinal
de
verceuil
but
will
burn
it
still
sealed
and
see
that
not
a
trace
remains
charles
shrugged
the
hohenstaufen
did
it
again
and
again
they
to
do
it
said
louis
and
that
is
one
reason
that
they
and
the
popes
are
such
enemies
but
i
do
it
for
the
same
reason
i
allow
you
to
go
to
italy
charles
to
prevent
a
greater
calamity
and
to
accomplish
a
greater
good
and
who
will
your
choice
for
pope
be
brother
louis
stood
up
i
do
not
want
to
compromise
myself
even
more
by
letting
that
be
known
i
will
write
the
name
in
my
letter
and
the
letter
will
be
sealed
he
stood
up
if
you
defeat
manfred
may
god
have
mercy
on
you
charles
you
will
be
a
king
in
your
own
right
and
you
will
know
what
it
is
to
have
to
make
decisions
like
this
simon
felt
sure
that
making
royal
decisions
would
never
be
the
agony
for
charles
that
it
was
for
louis
charles
stood
up
too
then
dropped
to
his
knee
and
pressed
his
forehead
against
his
brother
pale
hand
god
bless
you
louis
i
promise
you
this
is
one
decision
you
will
always
be
happy
to
have
made
will
always
be
happy
he
made
simon
thought
later
as
they
walked
together
through
the
gray
stone
halls
of
the
bishop
of
avignon
palace
charles
struck
simon
on
the
shoulder
the
blow
threw
simon
off
stride
reminding
him
how
strong
charles
was
you
did
it
boy
you
tipped
the
balance
for
me
when
you
pointed
out
what
might
happen
if
the
pope
dies
charles
said
with
a
grin
i
was
quite
angry
with
you
until
then
i
had
a
feeling
you
were
uncle
he
said
charles
boots
clicked
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
corridor
have
you
forgotten
that
if
it
were
not
for
me
you
would
still
be
growing
cobwebs
at
gobignon
no
uncle
i
have
not
forgotten
then
why
did
you
take
the
pope
letter
to
my
brother
without
telling
me
about
it
simon
felt
a
dull
heat
in
his
face
somewhere
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
had
always
known
that
uncle
charles
would
want
to
be
told
first
about
any
messages
passing
between
the
pope
and
the
king
but
feeling
it
would
be
wrong
simon
had
pretended
to
himself
that
he
knew
no
such
thing
it
was
my
duty
to
take
it
promptly
to
the
king
said
simon
looking
straight
ahead
charles
suddenly
stopped
walking
simon
he
said
forcing
simon
to
stop
turn
and
look
at
him
simon
do
not
let
your
idea
of
duty
make
you
forget
your
loyalty
to
me
i
helped
raise
you
as
a
boy
i
gave
you
this
opportunity
to
bring
honor
to
your
house
i
will
be
offering
you
even
greater
opportunities
i
have
not
forgotten
uncle
simon
said
again
i
do
not
suppose
you
know
how
to
unseal
and
reseal
a
royal
document
simon
felt
his
blood
heat
with
anger
no
uncle
he
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
denounce
charles
but
he
tried
to
put
disapproval
into
his
voice
i
have
never
heard
of
anyone
doing
such
a
thing
pas
mal
too
bad
charles
round
eyes
were
with
contempt
well
i
must
leave
at
once
to
begin
squeezing
the
money
for
this
campaign
out
of
my
subjects
especially
since
i
have
given
up
my
claim
to
provence
i
can
not
wait
around
to
see
who
my
brother
thinks
should
be
pope
i
am
sure
he
will
make
a
good
choice
i
am
sure
he
will
said
simon
frostily
pray
god
it
is
not
de
verceuil
again
the
heavy
blow
on
his
shoulder
both
comradely
and
threatening
well
then
in
the
future
when
you
have
important
news
make
sure
i
am
the
first
one
to
hear
it
simon
felt
hotter
still
uncle
charles
was
supposedly
helping
him
win
back
his
honor
and
yet
was
proposing
that
he
betray
the
king
trust
he
had
admired
uncle
charles
all
his
life
because
he
seemed
to
be
everything
a
great
baron
should
commanding
strong
warlike
victorious
loyal
to
the
king
the
church
and
the
pope
but
he
had
always
had
the
uneasy
feeling
that
charles
was
not
a
man
in
the
sense
that
king
louis
was
and
he
had
always
kept
in
the
back
of
his
mind
his
mother
warning
uses
he
had
felt
that
unease
strongly
over
a
year
ago
the
day
charles
asked
him
to
lead
the
military
escort
now
he
knew
there
was
good
reason
for
that
uneasiness
yes
uncle
simon
had
no
intention
of
obeying
but
since
charles
had
no
right
to
ask
such
a
thing
there
was
no
harm
in
misleading
him
after
a
year
in
italy
and
all
he
had
been
through
simon
found
he
feared
his
uncle
charles
less
than
he
had
and
trusted
him
less
and
now
he
thought
it
would
be
back
to
italy
back
to
see
his
efforts
bear
fruit
as
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
became
a
reality
perhaps
he
would
escort
the
tartars
to
france
to
king
louis
so
they
could
draw
up
their
war
plans
together
but
best
of
all
he
would
seek
out
sophia
in
perugia
he
would
propose
marriage
to
her
again
now
she
would
believe
him
now
that
she
had
time
to
think
about
everything
he
had
said
to
her
sophia
seeing
her
in
his
mind
he
felt
as
if
he
walked
among
the
angels
lviii
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
sat
at
a
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
colonnaded
audience
chamber
his
pale
blond
hair
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
come
forward
he
called
to
daoud
and
lorenzo
he
beckoned
to
them
the
wide
sleeve
of
his
green
tunic
falling
away
from
his
arm
their
booted
feet
echoed
on
the
long
floor
of
polished
pink
marble
daoud
stomach
felt
hollow
he
persuade
manfred
to
carry
the
war
into
the
north
at
once
a
dark
green
velvet
cloth
hanging
to
the
floor
covered
the
table
at
which
the
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
sat
the
tabletop
was
strewn
with
pens
and
open
rolls
of
parchment
two
chamberlains
in
dark
brown
tunics
hovered
at
manfred
back
he
wrote
quickly
on
one
parchment
after
another
and
handed
them
to
his
two
assistants
even
though
it
was
a
sunny
morning
outside
this
chamber
had
few
windows
and
manfred
to
see
his
work
needed
candelabra
at
each
end
of
the
table
when
daoud
and
lorenzo
reached
his
table
he
waved
in
dismissal
to
the
chamberlains
and
they
bowed
and
left
carrying
armloads
of
scrolls
seeing
manfred
at
work
daoud
felt
a
powerfully
protective
impulse
toward
him
manfred
was
not
king
but
he
had
become
a
worthy
ally
and
daoud
was
prepared
to
fight
manfred
enemies
to
die
if
need
be
fighting
them
an
old
friend
of
yours
wants
to
greet
you
david
said
manfred
his
bright
smile
flashing
daoud
saw
no
one
in
a
candlelit
alcove
behind
manfred
hung
a
painting
of
a
man
in
mail
armor
partly
covered
by
a
black
and
gold
surcoat
it
was
not
painted
on
the
wall
but
seemed
to
be
on
a
separate
piece
of
wood
with
a
gilded
border
which
was
hung
on
the
wall
the
man
looked
a
bit
like
manfred
and
daoud
suspected
it
must
be
his
father
the
famous
emperor
frederic
there
was
an
idolatrous
look
about
the
painting
and
the
way
it
was
displayed
that
made
daoud
uneasy
it
reminded
him
a
bit
of
the
saint
image
sophia
had
kept
in
her
room
at
orvieto
david
of
trebizond
came
a
cry
from
beside
manfred
manfred
reached
down
and
helped
a
bent
monkeylike
figure
scramble
up
to
stand
on
the
table
god
blesses
our
meeting
daoud
ibn
abdallah
this
time
said
the
dwarf
erculio
he
grinned
at
daoud
through
his
spiky
black
mustache
at
the
sight
of
him
daoud
winced
at
the
memory
of
all
the
pain
this
little
man
had
inflicted
on
him
he
still
felt
some
of
that
pain
especially
in
his
feet
despite
the
tawidh
hastening
of
the
healing
process
but
daoud
also
felt
a
sudden
warmth
that
reminded
him
of
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
little
man
here
at
lucera
deformed
in
body
and
soul
required
to
do
unspeakable
things
erculio
had
still
found
a
way
to
serve
god
if
my
lord
daoud
wishes
to
kill
me
i
am
at
his
service
said
erculio
in
arabic
i
have
finished
the
work
our
sultan
sent
me
to
do
in
italy
daoud
found
himself
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
you
would
have
saved
me
from
a
mutilation
worse
than
death
erculio
i
can
not
hate
you
for
that
you
did
your
work
well
erculio
looked
like
a
spider
when
he
bowed
his
head
touching
the
tabletop
his
elbows
bent
upward
i
am
my
lord
slave
he
was
the
more
admirable
daoud
thought
because
despite
being
so
deformed
he
had
found
important
work
to
do
in
the
world
how
is
your
former
master
faring
with
the
sienese
in
orvieto
he
asked
erculio
erculio
spread
his
hands
wide
alas
the
podesta
is
dead
dead
it
was
hard
to
believe
daoud
heard
lorenzo
startled
grunt
beside
him
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
never
forgave
him
for
surrendering
to
the
sienese
without
a
fight
erculio
said
vittorio
the
monaldeschi
heir
stabbed
him
to
death
in
his
office
and
then
escaped
into
the
hills
he
is
probably
seeking
asylum
with
the
church
leaders
in
perugia
i
would
rather
have
heard
that
killed
vittorio
said
lorenzo
then
there
would
be
some
sense
in
the
world
daoud
felt
a
pang
of
sorrow
and
was
surprised
at
himself
after
all
had
not
arrested
him
and
subjected
him
to
a
day
and
a
night
of
horrible
torment
with
the
threat
of
worse
hanging
over
him
but
he
remembered
the
podesta
as
a
man
of
rare
ability
who
would
have
ruled
orvieto
well
given
a
chance
his
death
was
a
waste
manfred
said
erculio
has
told
me
of
your
arrest
and
your
sufferings
at
the
hands
of
the
podesta
of
orvieto
i
want
to
hear
more
about
that
but
let
us
speak
now
of
perugia
what
is
ugolini
doing
lorenzo
and
i
escorted
cardinal
ugolini
to
perugia
and
left
him
there
daoud
said
he
planned
to
block
the
election
of
a
new
pope
by
keeping
the
italian
cardinals
united
behind
himself
he
paused
a
moment
now
should
he
bring
up
his
conviction
that
manfred
must
march
northward
before
a
new
pope
was
elected
but
while
he
hesitated
manfred
spoke
what
of
sophia
karaiannides
manfred
looked
sharply
at
daoud
the
sapphire
eyes
intent
why
did
you
not
bring
her
back
here
with
you
jealous
anger
stabbed
daoud
sophia
had
spoken
little
of
manfred
but
daoud
had
long
ago
realized
that
she
and
manfred
must
have
been
lovers
he
had
decided
not
to
think
about
that
now
manfred
was
wondering
what
had
happened
between
sophia
and
daoud
and
perhaps
wanted
sophia
back
daoud
could
read
it
in
manfred
tone
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
daoud
tried
to
see
manfred
as
sophia
might
have
intensely
one
might
almost
say
blindingly
handsome
strong
graceful
his
brilliant
mind
attractively
decked
out
with
elegance
and
wit
learned
but
carrying
his
learning
lightly
skilled
in
all
the
courtly
arts
and
graces
what
woman
could
resist
such
a
man
but
manfred
must
have
tired
of
her
as
such
men
did
who
had
access
to
any
woman
they
wanted
perhaps
his
queen
or
some
new
love
of
his
had
insisted
that
sophia
be
sent
away
and
once
she
was
gone
he
had
realized
what
he
had
lost
late
now
but
he
reminded
himself
he
must
not
let
sophia
come
between
himself
and
manfred
daoud
put
out
his
hands
palms
up
sophia
is
with
cardinal
ugolini
the
cardinal
courage
fails
him
at
times
we
thought
it
best
for
one
of
us
to
stay
and
give
him
strength
and
sophia
can
help
him
run
his
household
and
entertain
the
men
of
influence
he
must
see
manfred
nodded
a
small
smile
twitching
his
blond
mustache
yes
she
would
be
good
at
that
daoud
thought
of
simon
de
gobignon
and
felt
a
flash
of
hatred
for
him
but
he
must
report
about
him
too
she
has
captured
the
heart
of
a
young
french
nobleman
the
count
de
gobignon
who
commands
the
tartars
military
escort
when
charles
invades
italy
de
gobignon
will
surely
be
one
of
his
captains
charles
invades
italy
and
a
moment
ago
you
said
a
pope
of
the
french
party
is
elected
daoud
was
about
to
reply
but
manfred
raised
a
hand
for
silence
he
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
glance
as
if
for
reassurance
at
the
portrait
of
the
man
hanging
behind
him
he
strode
out
in
front
of
the
table
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
daoud
and
lorenzo
made
way
for
him
he
walked
the
length
of
the
marble
floor
to
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
dwarf
erculio
sank
down
on
the
tabletop
his
long
arms
clasped
around
his
knees
watching
manfred
sombrely
daoud
prayed
god
help
him
to
judge
king
louis
has
always
held
charles
back
manfred
said
turning
suddenly
to
face
daoud
and
lorenzo
louis
does
not
believe
that
the
pope
should
set
christian
rulers
against
one
another
help
me
to
advise
him
daoud
gathered
his
thoughts
the
success
of
his
mission
in
italy
depended
on
persuading
manfred
to
choose
the
right
course
his
heart
beat
harder
he
tried
to
speak
with
all
the
assurance
he
could
muster
sire
there
are
enough
french
cardinals
to
elect
the
next
pope
they
are
bound
to
choose
a
man
who
will
give
king
louis
what
he
wants
the
alliance
between
christians
and
tartars
and
that
same
pope
will
surely
offer
your
crown
to
charles
as
urban
did
if
louis
has
the
alliance
he
wants
above
all
else
he
will
not
stand
in
charles
way
manfred
sighed
and
turned
away
so
you
think
war
is
certain
it
daoud
cried
out
to
manfred
in
his
heart
no
yes
once
a
pope
is
elected
daoud
said
but
you
can
act
before
that
happens
use
the
time
ugolini
is
gaining
for
you
march
north
now
sire
while
your
enemies
are
without
a
head
join
forces
with
your
ghibellino
allies
in
northern
italy
siena
florence
pisa
and
the
rest
surround
the
college
of
cardinals
and
you
can
force
them
to
elect
a
pope
of
your
choice
or
scatter
them
of
them
are
needed
for
the
election
of
a
pope
you
might
be
able
to
stop
the
election
altogether
manfred
back
remained
turned
daoud
looked
at
lorenzo
he
could
not
read
lorenzo
expression
the
sicilian
mouth
was
hidden
beneath
his
grizzled
mustache
but
lorenzo
shook
his
head
slightly
as
if
to
say
that
daoud
was
not
having
the
effect
he
wanted
at
that
daoud
felt
himself
waver
toward
despair
he
commanded
himself
to
stand
firm
manfred
walked
back
to
the
table
he
stood
before
daoud
his
hands
still
clasped
behind
him
his
face
wore
a
haunted
look
the
cheerful
daoud
had
always
seen
before
was
gone
the
north
is
a
quagmire
this
time
of
year
for
your
enemies
as
well
as
for
you
daoud
said
and
they
do
not
yet
have
anything
like
the
strength
you
can
muster
you
can
call
up
your
vassals
here
in
a
few
weeks
time
when
charles
gets
a
summons
from
the
new
pope
he
will
then
have
to
gather
his
troops
in
france
and
cross
the
alps
into
italy
by
the
time
he
is
ready
you
could
have
all
of
italy
under
your
control
and
there
would
be
no
pope
to
give
legitimacy
to
his
invasion
manfred
snorted
and
turned
away
daoud
erculio
and
lorenzo
watched
him
pace
he
came
back
and
said
no
i
do
not
trust
those
you
call
my
allies
in
the
north
they
opposed
the
pope
but
neither
do
they
want
to
be
ruled
by
me
if
i
were
to
try
to
make
myself
king
of
italy
they
would
turn
against
me
probably
true
daoud
thought
remembering
the
reluctance
of
lapo
di
stefano
the
heir
of
siena
to
recognize
manfred
kingship
over
all
of
italy
baibars
would
be
in
the
north
like
lightning
though
he
would
welcome
the
bad
weather
because
it
would
impede
his
foes
while
he
himself
would
simply
not
his
own
troops
slow
down
because
of
it
and
if
any
of
his
allies
even
thought
of
betraying
him
he
would
kill
them
but
that
was
baibars
this
king
daoud
remembered
had
at
first
not
wanted
to
help
him
with
his
mission
in
orvieto
because
it
might
provoke
a
war
manfred
he
saw
kept
raising
objections
because
he
really
wanted
to
be
left
alone
to
enjoy
what
he
had
he
showed
no
interest
whatever
in
conquering
all
of
italy
he
was
the
enlightened
ruler
of
a
civilized
prosperous
land
and
he
probably
would
not
go
to
war
until
the
enemy
was
on
his
border
though
daoud
felt
for
manfred
and
his
wish
to
be
at
peace
he
knew
that
no
ruler
could
refuse
the
duty
of
war
peace
could
be
achieved
only
by
conquering
the
enemies
of
peace
every
great
ruler
of
islam
from
the
prophet
to
salah
and
baibars
had
been
a
warrior
on
horseback
daoud
heart
felt
like
a
lump
of
lead
he
saw
so
clearly
that
with
one
stroke
they
could
end
the
danger
of
a
union
between
tartars
and
christians
and
save
manfred
kingdom
he
sighed
inwardly
he
had
tried
his
best
and
failed
he
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
that
but
acceptance
was
not
surrender
you
surrendered
only
to
the
will
of
god
you
accepted
things
as
they
were
but
struggled
to
make
them
better
potter
does
not
sigh
for
better
clay
but
works
with
what
god
puts
in
his
sheikh
saadi
said
manfred
turned
away
from
daoud
walked
around
the
table
with
another
glance
at
the
portrait
and
sat
down
he
frowned
at
a
parchment
that
lay
before
him
as
if
wishing
to
end
the
conversation
daoud
said
then
sire
let
us
at
least
prepare
to
defend
ourselves
as
best
we
can
he
untied
a
small
leather
bag
from
his
belt
and
went
over
to
the
desk
manfred
looked
up
his
blond
eyebrows
lifted
daoud
said
allow
the
sultan
of
the
lands
of
islam
who
feels
himself
a
brother
to
you
to
come
to
your
aid
with
this
gift
he
upended
the
leather
bag
over
the
table
and
a
flood
of
tiny
lights
spilled
out
erculio
gasped
and
drew
back
from
the
small
pile
of
precious
stones
manfred
stared
in
wonder
this
is
enough
to
pay
and
equip
enough
knights
and
to
double
the
size
of
my
army
your
sultan
gives
with
a
great
heart
he
looked
at
daoud
with
more
warmth
that
daoud
had
ever
seen
in
those
cold
blue
eyes
or
is
it
in
fact
you
who
give
my
lord
the
sultan
commanded
me
to
use
this
wealth
carefully
and
to
help
you
if
your
enemies
should
attack
manfred
said
these
then
remain
of
the
jewels
i
sent
you
with
to
orvieto
twelve
you
are
a
remarkably
good
steward
daoud
i
should
put
you
in
charge
of
my
treasury
daoud
inclined
his
head
respectfully
i
hope
you
will
put
me
where
i
can
serve
you
better
sire
and
where
is
that
sire
my
work
here
is
far
from
done
give
me
a
unit
of
your
army
to
command
let
them
be
if
you
permit
fighting
men
of
my
own
faith
i
may
yet
kill
the
tartars
and
rescue
manfred
face
fairly
glowed
he
picked
up
one
of
the
jewels
from
his
table
a
large
precious
topaz
of
a
warm
golden
color
he
took
hand
laid
the
rare
stone
on
his
palm
and
closed
his
fingers
over
it
this
is
yours
use
it
to
recruit
and
supply
a
troop
of
your
own
in
my
service
they
should
count
themselves
blessed
by
god
to
have
a
mameluke
to
train
and
lead
them
it
is
i
who
am
blessed
daoud
said
he
looked
at
the
stone
in
his
hand
it
was
a
shade
lighter
than
the
color
of
sophia
eyes
he
bowed
again
to
manfred
at
last
he
could
fight
as
he
preferred
to
leading
troops
in
open
battle
as
a
mameluke
smiling
to
himself
he
stroked
his
chin
at
last
i
can
let
my
beard
letter
from
emir
daoud
ibn
abdallah
to
el
malik
baibars
from
lucera
day
of
rabia
next
to
the
byzantine
empire
this
kingdom
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
is
the
most
civilized
of
christian
nations
that
is
to
say
a
muslim
might
almost
be
comfortable
here
in
fact
many
are
the
chief
interests
of
king
manfred
courtiers
are
falconry
poetry
dalliance
with
beautiful
women
and
philosophical
disputation
my
lord
will
note
that
i
do
not
mention
warfare
king
manfred
seems
to
hope
that
some
intervention
by
god
or
fate
or
chance
will
make
it
unnecessary
for
him
to
take
the
field
against
charles
christian
warriors
generally
prefer
to
wait
for
their
enemies
to
come
to
them
reasoning
that
a
small
force
of
defenders
can
defeat
a
large
force
of
attackers
that
is
why
there
are
castles
everywhere
in
europe
even
in
the
cities
of
europe
their
wars
against
us
that
they
call
crusades
are
an
exception
and
perhaps
too
they
have
learned
something
from
the
failure
of
those
invasions
but
this
is
also
an
exceptional
moment
the
guelfi
and
the
french
are
not
ready
to
fight
and
manfred
could
win
everything
if
he
were
to
act
now
i
tried
to
persuade
him
to
invade
northern
italy
and
bring
the
papacy
under
his
control
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
so
we
must
await
charles
and
defeat
him
when
he
comes
after
that
italy
will
lie
open
to
manfred
then
for
his
own
future
safety
he
will
have
to
place
the
pope
under
his
influence
but
how
i
long
for
a
day
like
that
when
i
rode
behind
my
lord
baibars
to
destroy
the
tartars
on
the
field
at
the
well
of
goliath
it
appears
to
me
now
that
god
intends
the
destiny
of
the
dar
to
hinge
on
one
great
battle
if
manfred
defeats
charles
in
italy
the
franks
will
withdraw
to
lick
their
wounds
the
french
losses
will
deprive
louis
of
the
troops
he
needs
for
his
crusade
against
us
but
if
manfred
falls
then
the
pope
and
the
franks
made
greedy
by
victory
will
be
eager
to
join
forces
with
the
tartars
and
extend
their
empire
into
our
sacred
lands
of
islam
i
will
do
my
best
to
see
that
the
franks
do
not
defeat
manfred
and
if
i
fail
i
hope
not
to
live
to
see
what
comes
after
all
is
in
the
hands
of
god
the
the
compassionate
lix
cold
and
steady
the
rain
drummed
on
simon
leather
hat
his
wool
cloak
had
been
soaking
up
water
all
day
and
lay
heavy
as
an
iron
plate
on
his
body
it
was
not
yet
sunset
he
knew
but
the
rain
so
darkened
the
streets
of
perugia
that
he
despaired
of
finding
his
destination
he
rode
along
the
wide
main
street
hunched
over
against
the
chill
rain
sordello
and
thierry
on
either
side
their
two
spare
horses
and
their
baggage
mule
trailing
behind
people
hurried
past
without
looking
up
there
it
is
sordello
shouted
through
the
rain
simon
first
thought
on
seeing
the
baglioni
palace
was
only
we
had
been
in
a
place
like
that
when
the
filippeschi
rain
and
darkness
made
it
hard
for
him
to
see
it
in
detail
but
lighted
torches
and
candles
glowing
inside
the
windows
limned
its
general
shape
the
square
central
tower
loomed
high
above
the
surrounding
city
its
stone
face
ruddy
in
the
glow
from
the
upper
windows
of
four
cylindrical
corner
turrets
the
palace
was
surrounded
by
a
high
outer
wall
and
simon
supposed
there
was
an
expanse
of
bare
ground
between
the
wall
and
the
main
building
to
him
the
palace
looked
more
like
a
great
french
country
château
than
a
noble
italian
family
town
house
streamers
of
purple
cloth
betokening
mourning
were
draped
from
one
turret
of
the
gatehouse
to
the
other
the
ends
flapping
across
the
arch
of
the
gateway
the
tall
wooden
gate
sheltered
from
the
rain
by
a
pointed
arch
was
adorned
with
painted
carvings
of
the
lion
symbol
of
the
guelfi
and
the
griffin
symbol
of
the
city
of
perugia
simon
and
sordello
pounded
on
the
gate
and
admitted
them
simon
unstrapped
a
flat
leather
case
from
his
saddle
and
then
left
thierry
to
unload
and
stable
the
animals
he
and
sordello
hurried
through
the
rain
to
the
front
door
of
the
palace
simon
identified
himself
to
the
steward
who
conducted
him
with
much
solicitude
about
the
bad
weather
to
the
sala
maggiore
of
the
palace
in
the
great
hall
simon
was
glad
to
see
a
fire
of
logs
burning
on
a
stone
hearth
under
a
chimney
opening
he
headed
for
it
throwing
his
sopping
cloak
and
leather
hat
to
the
stone
floor
let
the
servants
pick
them
up
riding
all
day
in
the
rain
had
made
him
irritable
simon
friar
mathieu
was
shuffling
toward
him
leaning
heavily
on
a
walking
stick
the
old
franciscan
painfully
slow
movements
alarmed
him
simon
put
his
arms
about
him
but
gently
are
you
feeling
worse
father
the
weather
is
reminding
my
bones
that
they
were
cracked
not
long
ago
i
have
a
fire
on
the
hearth
in
my
room
upstairs
come
up
with
me
and
you
can
get
out
of
those
wet
clothes
simon
sent
sordello
to
the
kitchen
and
still
carrying
the
leather
case
followed
friar
mathieu
up
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
wrapped
in
a
blanket
seated
on
a
bench
before
the
fire
in
friar
mathieu
chamber
with
a
cup
of
hot
spiced
wine
in
his
hand
he
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
and
he
told
the
old
priest
about
his
journey
back
to
italy
from
avignon
king
louis
dismissed
me
on
the
twentieth
of
september
i
paid
fifty
livres
for
a
fast
galley
to
livorno
then
we
rode
our
horses
almost
to
death
through
the
hills
to
get
here
it
took
us
less
than
two
weeks
very
good
time
but
not
good
enough
simon
paused
he
remembered
the
old
pope
so
vividly
writing
letters
furiously
and
dispatching
them
hither
and
yon
feeling
surrounded
by
enemies
on
all
sides
and
knowing
he
was
going
to
die
he
had
so
wanted
to
bring
the
holy
father
good
news
now
pope
urban
was
no
more
and
simon
was
deeply
disappointed
surely
he
is
happier
out
of
all
this
turmoil
he
is
with
god
and
at
peace
and
what
news
do
you
bring
said
friar
mathieu
simon
leaned
toward
him
enthusiastically
the
pope
last
wish
has
been
granted
king
louis
has
agreed
to
let
his
brother
charles
make
war
on
king
manfred
instead
of
looking
delighted
as
simon
had
expected
friar
mathieu
surprised
him
by
sighing
and
staring
into
the
fire
are
you
not
pleased
simon
prodded
him
pleased
about
a
war
friar
mathieu
eyes
were
sad
under
his
brows
simon
felt
as
if
his
chair
had
been
pulled
out
from
under
him
and
he
had
been
dumped
on
the
floor
his
whole
being
had
been
focused
on
bringing
good
news
to
perugia
but
father
mathieu
this
means
that
the
alliance
of
tartars
and
christians
is
approved
by
pope
urban
anyway
now
that
pope
urban
was
dead
did
that
mean
anything
he
hesitated
confused
friar
mathieu
sighed
again
i
want
the
tartars
to
embrace
christianity
i
want
the
holy
places
liberated
but
this
warfare
in
italy
seems
to
me
a
false
turning
in
the
road
however
neither
you
nor
i
can
stop
the
march
of
events
what
is
it
you
are
carrying
simon
unbuckled
the
fastenings
of
the
leather
case
and
took
out
a
package
wrapped
in
silk
two
letters
written
by
king
louis
one
was
for
pope
urban
the
other
is
for
de
verceuil
if
pope
urban
should
die
you
will
have
trouble
delivering
either
one
the
one
for
pope
urban
i
will
keep
as
the
king
ordered
me
until
a
new
pope
is
elected
but
the
other
one
why
where
is
de
verceuil
locked
away
with
the
other
cardinals
in
the
cathedral
of
perugia
trying
to
make
himself
pope
the
thought
of
paulus
de
verceuil
as
supreme
head
of
the
church
made
simon
lip
curl
pope
not
him
he
has
the
support
of
about
half
the
french
cardinals
friar
mathieu
said
shaking
his
white
beard
the
cardinals
are
supposed
to
be
in
absolute
seclusion
with
no
messages
going
in
or
out
but
the
servants
who
bring
them
their
meals
report
things
in
both
directions
the
other
cardinals
lean
to
gerard
de
tracey
of
soissons
a
former
inquisitor
friar
mathieu
made
a
sour
face
what
of
the
italians
amazingly
despite
the
rumors
about
his
heresy
and
sorcery
ugolini
has
four
italian
cardinals
voting
for
him
the
servants
say
he
has
promised
large
sums
of
money
to
those
four
the
other
three
italian
votes
are
going
to
piacenza
that
must
include
ugolini
vote
since
the
rules
forbid
a
cardinal
to
vote
for
himself
voting
for
old
piacenza
is
just
a
gesture
of
course
he
probably
has
less
than
a
year
of
life
left
to
him
but
until
one
or
two
italians
can
be
persuaded
to
vote
for
a
french
candidate
no
frenchman
can
get
the
necessary
two
thirds
are
there
not
fourteen
french
cardinals
to
seven
italians
simon
asked
yes
but
right
now
there
are
only
twenty
cardinals
in
conclave
altogether
one
of
the
french
cardinals
is
in
england
on
a
diplomatic
mission
sent
by
pope
urban
before
his
death
so
even
united
the
thirteen
french
would
be
one
short
of
two
thirds
and
they
are
far
from
united
it
could
take
years
to
elect
a
new
pope
years
simon
was
horrified
what
a
disaster
without
a
pope
the
question
of
the
alliance
would
languish
the
tartar
ambassadors
might
yet
be
assassinated
or
just
die
hulagu
khan
might
die
even
king
louis
god
forbid
might
die
and
the
next
king
would
probably
not
be
interested
in
crusading
simon
for
his
part
had
pinned
his
hopes
for
the
restoration
of
his
family
honor
on
the
success
of
the
tartar
alliance
a
new
pope
must
be
elected
and
soon
he
carefully
took
the
two
scrolls
out
of
their
silk
wrappings
both
were
tied
with
red
ribbons
and
sealed
with
blobs
of
red
wax
which
king
louis
had
stamped
with
his
personal
seal
a
shield
bearing
simon
held
up
the
one
addressed
his
eminence
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
we
must
try
to
get
this
letter
to
de
verceuil
at
once
it
names
king
louis
choice
for
the
next
pope
it
could
end
the
deadlock
father
mathieu
stroked
his
white
beard
thoughtfully
exactly
the
sort
of
letter
the
rule
against
messages
was
instituted
to
keep
out
a
king
attempting
to
influence
a
papal
election
the
old
franciscan
took
the
scroll
in
one
hand
and
tapped
it
against
the
palm
of
the
other
but
i
think
for
the
good
of
the
church
and
for
the
success
of
our
own
mission
we
had
better
get
this
letter
to
de
verceuil
at
once
king
choice
can
not
be
worse
than
de
verceuil
de
tracey
or
ugolini
yes
said
simon
eagerly
but
how
do
we
get
the
letter
to
him
the
old
franciscan
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
it
hurt
simon
to
see
how
slow
and
painful
his
movements
were
damn
that
devil
in
black
who
had
tried
to
kill
the
tartars
the
tartars
he
had
thought
they
were
well
guarded
enough
and
that
it
was
safe
to
leave
them
while
he
carried
urban
letter
and
the
reply
but
if
the
question
of
the
alliance
were
to
drag
on
the
foes
of
the
alliance
would
try
again
to
strike
at
them
fear
clutched
at
his
heart
are
the
tartars
here
in
this
palace
he
called
after
friar
mathieu
who
was
hobbling
out
of
the
room
holding
king
louis
scroll
oh
yes
the
baglioni
family
have
given
them
a
whole
quarter
of
the
palace
they
are
well
enough
though
they
hate
being
trapped
indoors
by
the
weather
and
by
the
need
to
keep
them
under
guard
john
chagan
has
with
him
a
young
jewish
girl
named
rachel
whom
he
kidnapped
from
a
brothel
in
orvieto
the
girl
was
an
orphan
and
she
has
been
terribly
abused
she
is
virtually
their
prisoner
simon
mouth
twisted
and
we
want
to
ally
ourselves
with
such
men
how
can
such
things
go
on
in
the
same
city
with
the
sacred
college
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
grimly
nothing
i
have
said
has
made
any
difference
de
verceuil
insists
that
the
tartars
must
have
whatever
they
want
even
though
it
will
damn
their
souls
they
are
christians
after
all
if
john
dies
with
this
girl
on
his
conscience
he
will
go
straight
to
hell
simon
sighed
little
de
verceuil
cares
about
that
quite
so
said
friar
mathieu
well
we
must
get
the
king
letter
to
him
he
hailed
a
passing
servant
tell
the
cook
i
want
cardinal
de
verceuil
supper
sent
up
to
me
before
it
is
brought
around
to
him
at
the
cathedral
tell
him
to
be
sure
there
is
bread
with
the
meal
the
cardinal
wants
plenty
of
bread
and
he
turned
to
simon
what
is
your
equerry
name
thierry
what
on
earth
was
friar
mathieu
planning
simon
prayed
that
whatever
it
was
it
would
work
and
get
the
letter
through
find
thierry
and
have
him
bring
the
tray
up
to
me
thierry
had
borrowed
a
fresh
tunic
and
hose
from
one
of
the
baglioni
family
servants
his
dark
hair
which
usually
hung
in
neat
waves
was
wild
and
tangled
from
being
rubbed
dry
he
carried
verceuil
dinner
a
mixture
of
pieces
of
lobster
and
venison
with
bread
and
fruit
on
a
circular
wooden
tray
with
a
iron
cover
friar
mathieu
took
a
knife
and
sliced
lengthwise
through
the
hard
crust
of
a
long
loaf
of
bread
using
his
fingers
he
hollowed
out
the
bread
giving
chunks
of
it
to
simon
and
thierry
and
eating
the
rest
of
it
himself
the
lord
hates
waste
he
said
with
a
chuckle
this
is
white
bread
too
such
as
only
the
nobility
enjoy
as
simon
watched
holding
his
breath
friar
mathieu
laid
king
scroll
lengthwise
in
the
bread
and
closed
it
up
carefully
the
line
of
the
slicing
was
barely
visible
to
secure
the
package
he
took
a
loose
thread
from
one
of
his
blankets
tied
it
around
the
loaf
and
covered
the
thread
with
a
bunch
of
grapes
now
thierry
normally
one
of
the
cardinal
servants
takes
his
meals
to
him
but
tonight
you
will
we
want
as
few
people
as
possible
to
know
about
this
letter
if
cardinal
ugolini
found
out
about
it
he
would
make
such
a
scandal
of
it
that
he
might
even
end
up
being
elected
pope
might
not
ugolini
see
de
verceuil
reading
the
letter
simon
asked
no
said
friar
mathieu
each
cardinal
eats
and
sleeps
in
a
cell
built
along
the
sides
of
the
cathedral
nave
de
verceuil
and
king
louis
will
be
quite
alone
together
the
following
afternoon
the
sky
was
heavily
overcast
but
the
rain
had
stopped
from
the
northwest
tower
of
the
palazzo
baglioni
simon
could
see
that
perugia
was
a
much
bigger
city
than
orvieto
like
most
italian
cities
it
was
built
on
a
hilltop
but
while
orvieto
was
flat
on
top
of
its
great
rock
perugia
stood
on
sloping
ground
and
the
town
had
several
levels
simon
simon
turned
to
see
friar
mathieu
white
head
emerge
from
the
trapdoor
opening
to
the
tower
roof
as
he
hurried
over
to
give
the
old
man
a
hand
up
his
heartbeat
speeded
up
the
wait
for
news
must
be
at
an
end
when
he
saw
friar
mathieu
smiling
he
started
grinning
himself
the
letter
did
it
the
priest
said
cheerfully
we
have
a
pope
and
it
is
neither
de
verceuil
nor
de
tracey
nor
ugolini
simon
felt
like
shouting
for
joy
who
then
why
the
person
named
in
the
letter
you
brought
of
course
said
friar
mathieu
teasingly
spare
me
this
riddling
father
simon
begged
not
now
this
means
too
much
to
me
all
right
all
right
friar
mathieu
patted
simon
on
the
shoulder
this
morning
at
tierce
i
joined
the
crowd
at
the
cathedral
to
see
the
color
of
the
smoke
of
the
burning
ballots
from
the
chimney
of
the
bishop
palace
if
the
king
letter
had
its
effect
the
smoke
should
be
white
but
it
was
not
simon
heart
sank
had
he
misunderstood
friar
mathieu
black
smoke
then
but
you
said
they
did
elect
a
pope
no
smoke
at
all
the
people
were
puzzled
and
so
was
i
and
we
all
waited
to
see
if
anything
would
happen
i
was
about
to
give
up
and
leave
when
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
opened
and
there
stood
little
cardinal
ugolini
with
most
of
the
sacred
college
behind
him
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
eating
rotten
figs
when
i
saw
that
i
knew
the
news
must
be
good
as
cardinal
camerlengo
he
announced
we
have
a
pope
well
you
can
imagine
that
took
everyone
aback
he
explained
that
the
one
elected
was
not
present
and
his
name
could
not
be
announced
until
he
had
come
to
perugia
and
had
officially
accepted
then
the
cardinals
came
down
the
steps
one
by
one
most
of
them
looked
happy
to
be
out
of
the
cathedral
after
a
week
of
imprisonment
but
de
verceuil
and
de
tracey
looked
as
ill
as
ugolini
de
verceuil
has
come
back
to
the
palace
now
so
you
had
better
walk
carefully
simon
remembered
that
friar
mathieu
had
said
the
cardinals
had
elected
the
man
named
in
king
louis
letter
but
apparently
the
man
was
yet
elected
simon
felt
uneasy
the
chosen
one
was
not
even
in
perugia
too
much
could
go
wrong
he
searched
his
brain
friar
mathieu
had
said
something
last
night
about
one
of
the
cardinals
being
absent
which
one
who
is
the
man
they
elected
simon
cried
the
way
friar
mathieu
was
telling
this
was
maddening
smiling
friar
mathieu
said
that
is
why
i
did
not
come
to
you
at
once
a
priest
in
de
verceuil
entourage
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
i
waited
until
i
could
get
the
rest
of
the
story
from
him
could
the
letter
i
brought
make
such
a
difference
simon
exclaimed
well
de
verceuil
sent
thierry
away
before
looking
inside
that
loaf
of
bread
his
servant
and
his
secretary
who
were
living
with
him
stood
outside
his
cell
and
heard
groans
and
cries
of
rage
from
within
de
verceuil
threw
his
dinner
on
the
floor
and
stamped
out
of
his
cell
while
the
servant
cleaned
the
cell
de
verceuil
visited
and
spoke
secretly
with
each
of
the
other
french
cardinals
in
turn
this
morning
when
it
came
time
for
them
to
vote
de
verceuil
rose
and
said
eligo
guy
le
gros
i
elect
guy
le
gros
then
each
of
the
other
french
cardinals
said
the
same
thing
after
him
gros
simon
thought
gros
is
the
cardinal
who
is
not
so
that
was
who
king
louis
wanted
simon
remembered
meeting
him
at
pope
urban
council
a
year
ago
a
stout
genial
man
with
a
long
black
beard
de
verceuil
had
mocked
him
because
he
had
once
been
married
and
had
daughters
de
verceuil
would
have
to
eat
that
mockery
now
what
did
this
mean
for
the
alliance
le
gros
must
be
favorable
why
else
would
king
louis
have
chosen
him
but
why
no
smoke
simon
asked
when
a
cardinal
acclaims
a
candidate
orally
after
a
deadlock
and
the
others
follow
suit
it
is
called
election
by
because
it
is
as
if
the
cardinals
have
been
divinely
inspired
no
ballots
are
needed
so
there
is
nothing
to
burn
in
this
case
they
were
inspired
by
king
louis
with
some
help
from
you
and
me
when
two
italian
cardinals
piacenza
who
knew
he
was
too
old
to
be
pope
for
long
and
marchetti
who
was
always
opposed
to
ugolini
joined
the
cry
for
le
gros
it
was
all
over
ugolini
collapsed
in
tears
but
he
was
revived
enough
to
make
the
arrangements
to
send
to
england
for
le
gros
to
come
in
haste
everybody
was
sworn
to
silence
and
ugolini
went
out
to
make
the
public
announcement
of
course
despite
the
secrecy
all
perugia
knows
it
will
be
le
gros
but
the
alliance
simon
asked
anxiously
friar
mathieu
reached
out
and
took
his
hand
we
will
have
to
wait
until
le
gros
is
officially
crowned
but
we
can
count
on
one
of
his
first
acts
being
a
call
for
an
alliance
between
the
princes
of
christendom
and
the
khans
of
tartary
and
right
after
that
will
follow
a
declaration
that
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
is
deposed
and
charles
is
the
rightful
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
a
feeling
of
triumph
swept
simon
once
the
alliance
is
secured
he
said
i
can
really
believe
that
i
have
the
right
to
be
the
count
de
gobignon
oh
said
friar
mathieu
is
that
the
assurance
you
need
he
spoke
in
a
dubious
tone
that
made
simon
uneasy
well
then
i
hope
for
your
sake
le
gros
gets
here
from
england
all
the
sooner
even
though
i
do
not
look
forward
to
the
war
he
will
unleash
care
nothing
about
this
war
between
charles
and
manfred
von
simon
thought
his
work
would
be
done
when
he
delivered
the
tartars
with
the
pope
blessing
to
king
louis
and
at
the
same
time
he
thought
he
might
bring
sophia
to
france
in
his
present
happy
mood
the
thought
of
her
was
like
a
sunrise
if
there
was
to
be
war
in
italy
if
charles
was
to
invade
her
homeland
of
sicily
she
might
be
all
the
more
grateful
to
him
for
offering
her
a
marriage
that
would
take
her
away
from
all
that
he
must
arrange
a
rendezvous
with
her
at
once
luckily
simon
thought
the
rain
that
plagued
umbria
this
time
of
year
had
let
up
for
three
days
and
the
roads
leading
out
of
perugia
into
the
countryside
were
fairly
dry
he
would
have
braved
a
flood
or
a
blizzard
to
see
sophia
again
but
it
pleased
him
that
there
were
blue
breaks
in
the
gray
dome
of
cloud
overhead
after
meeting
on
a
road
northwest
of
perugia
simon
and
sophia
had
ridden
to
a
woodland
lake
that
reflected
the
blue
in
a
darker
tone
on
its
rippling
surface
simon
felt
himself
breathing
rapidly
with
excitement
as
he
surveyed
the
lake
shore
it
seemed
almost
miraculous
that
sophia
was
standing
beside
him
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
of
land
big
rocks
that
looked
as
if
they
might
have
rolled
down
the
surrounding
hillsides
lay
on
the
shore
of
the
small
lake
the
floor
of
the
wood
was
thick
with
brown
leaves
this
forest
simon
thought
probably
belonged
to
some
local
nobleman
most
of
the
countryside
around
here
was
farmland
even
though
denuded
by
autumn
the
masses
of
trees
on
the
opposite
shore
looked
impenetrable
ramparts
of
gray
spikes
frequently
interrupted
by
the
dark
green
of
pines
the
place
had
all
the
privacy
he
had
hoped
for
he
prayed
that
this
time
alone
together
would
not
end
in
disaster
as
their
last
meeting
outside
orvieto
had
holding
sophia
arm
and
guiding
her
down
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
gave
simon
a
warm
pleasant
feeling
a
tremor
ran
through
his
hands
when
he
grasped
her
slender
waist
and
lifted
her
how
light
she
felt
to
perch
on
a
big
black
boulder
she
laughed
gaily
and
her
laughter
was
like
church
bells
at
easter
he
scooped
up
leaves
and
piled
them
at
the
base
of
the
rock
when
he
had
a
pile
big
enough
for
two
people
to
sit
on
he
spread
his
cloak
over
it
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
slid
from
the
boulder
to
the
leaves
he
went
foraging
in
the
wood
and
quickly
gathered
an
armload
of
broken
branches
and
a
few
heavy
sticks
he
made
a
ring
of
stones
near
the
water
edge
and
piled
the
branches
within
it
putting
leaves
and
small
twigs
that
would
catch
fire
easily
under
the
larger
pieces
of
wood
he
added
some
dried
moss
and
took
flint
and
steel
out
of
a
pouch
at
his
belt
struck
sparks
several
times
and
got
the
moss
to
smoke
he
blew
on
the
glowing
spots
till
a
bright
orange
flame
appeared
in
a
moment
the
pile
of
branches
was
afire
sophia
crawled
to
the
fire
and
held
her
hands
out
to
its
warmth
simon
sat
beside
her
so
close
their
shoulders
touched
he
felt
a
pang
of
disappointment
when
she
moved
just
a
bit
away
from
him
how
comfortable
you
made
us
she
said
sounding
a
little
surprised
she
was
very
much
a
city
woman
simon
thought
she
seemed
to
know
little
about
the
country
and
he
had
noticed
that
she
never
looked
entirely
relaxed
on
horseback
are
you
surprised
that
i
know
how
to
make
a
fire
in
the
woods
he
felt
inordinate
pride
at
being
able
to
show
off
this
small
skill
to
her
i
did
think
you
relied
on
servants
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
for
you
a
knight
may
not
always
have
equerries
or
servants
to
help
him
i
know
dozens
of
useful
things
that
might
surprise
you
i
can
even
cook
and
sew
for
myself
marvelous
the
woman
you
marry
will
be
fortunate
indeed
as
soon
as
she
said
it
the
light
went
out
of
her
eyes
and
she
looked
quickly
away
an
uneasy
silence
fell
over
them
her
obvious
dismay
threw
him
into
despair
again
he
remembered
their
struggles
and
her
tears
and
his
own
that
morning
in
the
pine
forest
outside
orvieto
after
a
pause
with
an
obviousness
that
sunk
him
into
an
even
deeper
gloom
she
changed
the
subject
uncle
told
me
all
about
what
they
did
when
the
pope
died
he
was
with
the
holy
father
right
to
the
end
just
before
he
died
pope
urban
said
the
tartars
adelberto
i
would
have
thought
uncle
made
that
up
but
he
says
all
the
attendant
priests
and
servants
heard
it
uncle
says
it
proves
pope
urban
had
changed
his
mind
at
the
end
about
that
alliance
you
are
all
so
worried
about
maybe
the
pope
was
warning
your
uncle
that
the
tartars
are
angry
at
him
for
all
the
trouble
he
has
caused
them
said
simon
forcing
himself
to
comment
on
something
that
at
the
moment
did
not
interest
him
he
refused
to
worry
about
whether
pope
urban
had
a
deathbed
change
of
heart
how
beautiful
her
eyes
were
such
a
warm
brown
color
he
had
everything
planned
out
for
both
of
them
she
had
only
to
agree
he
would
present
her
first
to
king
louis
how
could
the
king
disapprove
his
marriage
to
a
cardinal
niece
and
with
the
king
support
no
one
else
could
object
besides
nicolette
and
roland
would
love
her
he
was
sure
of
it
she
went
on
anyway
uncle
said
that
the
pope
chest
filled
up
with
black
bile
and
that
was
what
killed
him
the
pope
felt
for
a
heartbeat
and
when
there
was
none
uncle
took
a
silver
hammer
and
tapped
the
pope
on
the
forehead
with
it
really
simon
had
no
idea
they
did
that
the
strange
scene
interested
him
in
spite
of
his
longing
for
sophia
to
make
sure
he
was
dead
and
then
uncle
called
his
name
his
baptismal
name
not
his
name
as
pope
are
you
dead
he
did
this
three
times
and
when
the
pope
did
not
answer
he
said
urban
is
truly
dead
and
he
took
the
fisherman
ring
off
the
pope
finger
and
cut
it
to
bits
with
silver
shears
and
with
the
hammer
he
broke
the
seal
so
they
must
make
a
new
ring
for
the
new
pope
when
cardinal
le
gros
is
made
pope
he
will
confirm
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
said
simon
eager
to
put
a
finish
to
the
topic
and
bring
the
conversation
back
to
the
two
of
them
sophia
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
lovely
hands
with
long
slender
fingers
looked
sadly
toward
the
lake
i
suppose
that
pleases
you
why
not
be
happy
for
me
my
work
is
nearly
done
he
wanted
to
add
but
dared
not
can
be
she
turned
to
look
at
him
her
eyes
troubled
uncle
says
the
new
pope
will
call
charles
to
invade
italy
and
make
war
on
king
manfred
will
you
be
with
the
invaders
charles
will
surely
expect
me
to
join
simon
thought
well
he
would
simply
tell
uncle
charles
that
he
had
no
wish
to
spend
any
more
time
in
italy
when
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
is
settled
i
mean
to
go
home
he
was
about
to
tell
her
again
that
he
wanted
her
to
come
with
him
but
she
spoke
first
you
know
this
count
charles
well
do
you
not
how
soon
do
you
think
he
will
march
into
italy
simon
wanted
to
talk
about
their
future
not
about
charles
plans
for
war
with
manfred
but
he
tried
to
answer
her
question
he
is
pressing
his
people
for
money
now
then
he
must
gather
his
army
and
it
can
take
months
to
move
an
army
from
the
south
of
france
to
southern
italy
with
winter
coming
on
he
will
probably
wait
until
next
year
to
cross
the
alps
my
guess
is
he
be
here
in
italy
next
summer
she
was
about
to
speak
again
probably
to
ask
another
question
about
count
charles
he
quickly
broke
in
what
i
told
you
last
time
that
i
am
a
bastard
and
that
the
last
count
de
gobignon
was
not
my
real
father
does
that
make
you
less
willing
to
marry
me
her
face
squeezed
together
as
if
a
sharp
pain
had
struck
her
you
are
not
going
to
start
talking
about
marriage
again
simon
her
words
were
like
a
knife
wound
in
his
chest
while
he
searched
for
words
his
eyes
explored
the
steep
brown
hills
that
surrounded
this
secluded
lake
their
tops
were
veiled
in
mist
like
his
past
i
have
never
stopped
thinking
about
marrying
you
sophia
you
are
the
one
person
in
the
world
who
can
make
me
happy
he
reached
over
into
her
lap
and
took
her
hand
it
felt
cool
and
smooth
i
could
never
never
make
you
happy
she
said
you
know
nothing
about
me
why
was
she
always
saying
that
what
was
there
to
know
about
a
woman
who
had
lived
a
quiet
life
in
sicily
was
widowed
at
an
early
age
and
had
come
to
live
with
her
cardinal
uncle
i
know
enough
his
eyes
felt
on
fire
with
longing
and
you
know
enough
about
me
to
see
that
the
differences
between
our
families
do
not
matter
you
know
what
i
am
and
we
care
more
about
each
other
than
we
do
about
your
uncle
opposing
what
my
king
wants
oh
simon
now
there
were
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
but
she
did
not
try
to
pull
her
hand
away
it
pained
him
to
see
how
this
was
hurting
her
though
he
did
not
understand
why
it
should
she
said
you
are
telling
tales
to
yourself
if
you
imagine
we
could
ever
marry
you
should
not
even
think
of
it
whatever
your
mother
did
you
are
still
the
count
de
gobignon
you
are
almost
a
member
of
the
french
royal
family
i
am
sure
cardinal
ugolini
does
not
agree
that
your
family
is
so
obscure
simon
said
it
is
time
i
talked
to
him
about
this
then
you
will
believe
i
mean
it
she
struck
her
hands
against
his
chest
no
no
you
must
not
do
that
do
you
not
realize
how
upset
he
is
about
this
war
and
how
he
feels
toward
the
french
if
he
even
knew
that
i
had
been
alone
with
you
today
he
would
force
me
to
go
back
to
siracusa
at
once
the
feel
of
her
hands
on
him
even
to
hit
him
in
reproof
excited
him
i
would
not
let
that
happen
he
said
gravely
he
heard
wild
geese
flying
southward
calling
in
the
distance
their
cries
made
this
place
seem
terribly
lonely
even
though
the
little
lake
was
only
a
short
ride
from
perugia
he
had
seen
no
sign
of
a
human
being
anywhere
the
fire
was
burning
low
he
went
to
gather
more
wood
sophia
frowned
at
him
when
he
came
back
what
did
you
mean
you
would
not
allow
my
uncle
to
send
me
away
he
leaned
closer
seizing
both
of
her
hands
in
his
the
pleasure
of
holding
her
hands
rippled
through
him
like
a
fluttering
of
wings
in
his
exalted
state
he
was
moved
to
utter
extravagant
words
i
mean
that
if
you
were
to
leave
perugia
i
would
ride
after
you
i
would
fight
any
men
your
uncle
had
set
to
guard
you
i
would
take
you
back
to
gobignon
with
me
and
there
with
you
inside
my
castle
i
would
defy
the
world
oh
simon
his
words
sounded
foolish
to
him
after
he
spoke
them
aloud
yet
men
he
knew
had
done
such
things
lancelot
tristan
if
the
old
songs
were
to
be
believed
how
better
to
prove
his
love
than
to
commit
crimes
and
risk
disgrace
for
her
she
was
crying
again
she
put
her
hands
over
her
face
why
he
wondered
when
he
declared
his
love
for
her
and
told
her
he
wanted
to
marry
her
did
it
make
her
so
unhappy
if
she
did
not
care
for
him
she
should
be
indifferent
or
angry
why
instead
did
she
cry
so
hard
must
be
that
she
wants
me
but
can
not
believe
it
is
the
sight
of
her
slender
body
shaking
with
sobs
tore
at
his
heart
he
could
not
hold
himself
back
even
if
she
fought
him
again
he
must
put
his
arms
around
her
he
reached
out
to
hold
her
she
fell
against
him
she
felt
wonderful
in
his
arms
solid
enough
to
assure
him
that
this
was
no
dream
yet
light
enough
to
allow
him
to
feel
that
he
could
do
anything
he
wanted
with
her
he
remembered
how
angry
she
had
been
in
the
pine
forest
outside
orvieto
when
he
had
tried
to
make
love
to
her
though
he
might
be
eaten
up
with
longing
for
her
he
must
just
hold
her
and
be
glad
she
allowed
him
to
do
that
she
raised
her
face
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
lips
the
soft
pressure
of
her
lips
on
his
made
his
arms
ache
to
hold
her
tighter
but
he
fought
the
feeling
down
why
do
you
cry
so
hard
when
i
speak
to
you
of
love
he
whispered
because
no
one
has
ever
loved
me
as
you
do
she
said
she
rested
her
head
against
his
chest
and
he
stroked
her
hair
his
eyes
lingered
over
the
curves
of
her
breasts
he
wanted
to
drop
his
hand
from
her
hair
to
her
breast
he
felt
the
yearning
to
touch
her
breast
as
a
pain
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
but
you
have
been
married
he
said
did
not
your
husband
love
you
he
felt
her
head
shaking
his
heart
was
beating
so
hard
he
was
sure
she
must
hear
it
we
were
little
more
than
children
i
am
not
a
child
and
neither
are
you
believe
me
when
i
say
i
want
to
marry
you
oh
simon
i
do
believe
you
she
cried
and
she
broke
out
in
a
fresh
storm
of
sobs
now
he
could
not
help
himself
he
had
to
hold
her
tight
she
leaned
against
him
and
they
slipped
back
until
they
were
both
lying
down
he
on
his
back
and
she
on
top
of
him
his
hand
felt
the
small
of
her
back
how
narrow
her
waist
was
he
felt
her
move
against
him
in
a
new
way
her
arms
slid
around
him
her
hands
on
his
neck
her
lips
were
on
his
again
but
this
time
pressing
hard
ferocious
devouring
he
felt
her
teeth
and
tongue
her
breath
hot
in
his
mouth
she
was
suddenly
a
different
woman
not
the
shy
cardinal
niece
she
was
demanding
brimming
over
with
a
need
to
match
his
their
hands
hurried
over
each
other
bodies
touching
through
their
clothes
and
then
under
their
clothes
simon
had
no
time
to
be
surprised
at
the
change
that
had
come
over
her
she
was
undoing
the
laces
down
the
front
of
her
gown
then
taking
his
hands
and
holding
them
against
her
naked
breasts
he
nearly
fainted
with
the
wonder
of
it
and
while
he
held
her
breasts
unable
to
take
his
hands
away
her
hands
moved
downward
fumbling
at
his
clothing
and
at
her
own
her
body
sliding
against
him
her
hand
seizing
his
manhood
her
legs
opening
to
receive
him
he
groaned
and
squeezed
his
eyes
shut
and
she
cried
out
with
delight
as
he
entered
her
she
pushed
herself
upward
pressing
her
hands
against
his
shoulders
arching
her
back
his
hands
moved
in
gentle
circles
over
her
breasts
her
hard
nipples
pressing
into
his
palms
her
hips
thrust
against
him
furiously
he
felt
waves
of
pleasure
rising
to
a
crest
in
his
loins
his
eyes
came
open
and
he
saw
under
the
olive
skin
of
her
face
and
neck
and
bosom
a
deep
crimson
flush
her
joyous
scream
echoed
cross
the
lake
you
shall
come
with
me
to
gobignon
he
whispered
in
her
ear
they
lay
wrapped
in
his
cloak
legs
entangled
clothing
in
disarray
the
wind
rattling
the
bare
branches
overhead
he
heard
his
palfrey
and
her
horse
in
the
brush
nearby
stamping
and
snorting
restlessly
the
horses
must
be
hungry
you
shall
marry
me
he
said
she
lay
motionless
her
head
under
his
resting
on
his
arm
i
will
not
i
can
not
her
tone
was
leaden
despairing
after
what
had
just
happened
how
could
she
still
refuse
him
was
she
ashamed
did
she
feel
she
had
sinned
we
are
as
good
as
married
now
oh
simon
she
sounded
as
if
she
were
talking
to
a
hopelessly
innocent
boy
there
will
be
a
new
pope
and
the
alliance
will
be
sealed
and
my
work
will
be
done
he
said
i
agreed
to
do
this
and
i
will
see
it
through
but
i
do
not
have
to
be
a
part
of
the
war
between
count
charles
and
the
king
of
sicily
and
neither
do
you
all
i
want
is
to
go
home
and
to
take
you
with
me
with
you
beside
me
my
home
will
be
all
of
the
world
that
i
want
her
arms
were
tight
around
him
but
she
was
silent
it
did
not
matter
if
she
did
not
answer
him
after
what
had
just
happened
between
them
he
felt
as
if
he
knew
her
mind
as
fully
as
he
knew
her
body
she
loved
him
and
would
marry
him
he
was
sure
of
it
overhead
wild
geese
called
lx
did
i
ever
make
love
to
him
sophia
had
asked
herself
the
same
question
countless
times
since
that
day
by
the
wooded
lake
for
two
months
she
had
managed
to
keep
away
from
simon
now
he
was
here
in
ugolini
mansion
she
stood
before
the
door
of
ugolini
audience
room
the
servant
who
had
come
to
fetch
her
was
about
to
open
it
sophia
hands
felt
coated
with
frost
terrified
of
being
with
simon
again
she
hated
herself
for
what
she
had
done
to
daoud
to
simon
and
to
herself
the
servant
opened
the
door
she
stepped
through
quickly
and
he
closed
it
behind
her
and
there
was
simon
de
gobignon
tall
and
handsome
as
ever
looking
down
at
her
reproachfully
tension
made
her
heart
beat
so
hard
that
she
wanted
to
put
her
hand
on
her
chest
to
still
it
instead
she
held
her
hand
out
so
that
simon
could
bend
down
from
his
towering
height
and
kiss
it
she
was
so
upset
by
his
unexpected
arrival
that
she
did
not
comprehend
his
murmured
greeting
behind
simon
back
ugolini
sitting
at
a
large
writing
desk
rolled
his
eyes
and
stretched
his
mouth
in
a
grimace
at
her
simon
was
still
bent
over
her
hand
so
she
was
able
to
shake
her
head
slightly
in
answer
to
his
unspoken
question
simon
must
have
come
here
as
a
last
resort
because
after
yielding
to
him
in
secret
she
had
tried
to
shut
him
out
of
her
life
she
could
hardly
convey
that
to
ugolini
now
even
if
she
wanted
to
the
count
de
gobignon
has
come
to
call
on
you
my
dear
said
ugolini
his
smooth
voice
betraying
none
of
his
anxiety
i
have
given
my
permission
provided
it
is
also
your
wish
your
signory
pays
me
too
much
honor
she
said
softly
to
simon
her
mind
spun
how
could
she
talk
to
simon
when
she
did
not
understand
herself
well
enough
to
know
what
lies
to
tell
him
she
wondered
what
ugolini
would
think
of
her
if
he
knew
all
of
what
had
happened
between
her
and
simon
when
they
met
that
day
would
he
be
shocked
contemptuous
would
he
tell
daoud
all
he
knew
of
her
meeting
with
simon
in
october
was
that
simon
had
again
proposed
marriage
to
her
and
she
had
rejected
him
she
said
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
your
signory
even
remembers
me
i
do
not
believe
we
have
seen
each
other
since
the
reception
for
the
tartar
ambassadors
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
last
year
is
that
not
so
an
appreciative
smile
replaced
the
somber
expression
on
simon
face
his
eyes
twinkled
at
her
doubtless
he
thought
they
were
conspirators
together
poor
poor
but
she
could
not
see
that
look
warming
his
features
without
feeling
it
again
that
surge
of
desire
that
had
driven
her
to
give
herself
to
him
two
months
ago
is
happening
to
me
many
months
have
passed
and
much
has
happened
madonna
he
said
but
forgive
me
if
i
am
too
forward
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
forget
you
now
that
we
are
together
in
a
new
city
i
hoped
to
renew
your
acquaintance
this
endless
moving
about
will
be
the
death
of
me
said
ugolini
unhappily
papa
le
gros
no
sooner
arrives
from
england
and
is
officially
elected
than
he
tells
us
he
will
be
crowned
in
viterbo
and
make
that
the
new
papal
seat
i
have
hardly
had
time
to
unpack
here
in
perugia
your
furnishings
seem
in
good
order
to
me
your
eminence
said
simon
with
a
smile
looking
around
the
large
room
with
its
row
of
large
windows
its
thick
carpeting
and
its
heavy
black
chairs
and
tables
a
large
shield
carved
in
stone
over
the
fireplace
behind
ugolini
was
painted
with
five
red
bands
on
a
white
background
these
are
not
mine
said
ugolini
waving
a
hand
dismissively
not
my
idea
of
comfortable
surroundings
at
all
no
i
simply
bought
this
house
and
its
furnishings
from
a
genoese
merchant
who
was
using
it
only
part
of
the
year
i
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
how
much
i
paid
for
it
you
would
think
me
a
fool
a
typical
genoese
he
took
advantage
of
my
need
and
now
i
must
sell
all
probably
to
the
same
merchant
and
probably
at
a
loss
that
is
another
reason
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
madonna
sophia
said
simon
i
feared
that
you
like
your
good
uncle
might
find
all
this
uprooting
tiresome
and
might
return
to
sicily
and
i
would
be
hard
put
to
find
you
again
with
an
inward
shudder
sophia
realized
the
strength
of
simon
resolve
to
possess
her
only
the
truth
would
kill
that
determination
and
she
would
never
dare
to
tell
him
that
besides
there
was
a
part
of
her
that
mad
as
it
was
delighted
in
seeing
how
powerfully
he
was
drawn
to
her
i
am
thinking
of
going
home
myself
said
ugolini
what
need
for
me
to
go
with
the
new
pope
on
this
tedious
search
for
safety
if
you
returned
to
sicily
said
simon
to
sophia
it
might
be
ages
before
i
see
you
again
his
words
frightened
her
was
he
about
to
ask
ugolini
for
her
hand
and
how
would
the
cardinal
deal
with
that
forgive
me
if
i
raise
an
unpleasant
subject
said
ugolini
but
if
your
count
charles
accepts
the
pope
offer
of
the
crown
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
any
french
nobleman
will
be
welcome
in
my
homeland
there
was
no
if
about
what
charles
would
do
sophia
thought
that
was
just
ugolini
courtesy
i
know
your
eminence
said
simon
looking
grim
i
hope
you
will
still
think
of
me
as
your
friend
despite
events
just
as
we
have
been
friends
while
we
disagreed
over
this
matter
of
the
tartar
alliance
ugolini
clapped
his
hands
suddenly
well
it
is
a
happy
occasion
when
my
niece
has
such
a
distinguished
visitor
count
this
house
has
a
loggia
overlooking
the
atrium
it
is
private
enough
to
shield
you
from
prying
eyes
yet
not
so
private
as
to
place
you
lovely
young
people
in
peril
of
temptation
sophia
will
show
you
the
way
bowing
and
thanking
ugolini
simon
followed
sophia
out
of
the
room
she
turned
to
simon
as
soon
as
the
door
of
ugolini
audience
chamber
had
closed
behind
them
and
said
i
need
my
cloak
for
the
cold
wait
here
and
i
will
go
to
my
room
and
get
it
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
answer
she
hurried
down
the
corridor
desperately
trying
to
make
sense
of
her
thoughts
and
feelings
their
lovemaking
had
been
a
terrible
mistake
and
yet
there
had
been
times
in
those
two
months
when
the
recollection
of
the
two
of
them
wrapped
in
his
cloak
lying
on
a
bed
of
leaves
the
depth
of
his
passion
for
her
and
the
wildness
of
her
answering
feelings
crept
up
on
her
unexpectedly
and
sent
thrills
of
pleasure
coursing
through
her
as
she
rummaged
in
her
chest
for
a
warm
cloak
her
eyes
met
those
of
her
icon
of
saint
simon
stylites
and
she
felt
shame
wash
over
her
can
i
think
that
i
truly
love
daoud
when
i
gave
myself
so
freely
to
his
enemy
but
had
that
not
been
what
daoud
had
expected
her
to
do
all
along
he
had
always
been
jealous
had
always
made
it
obvious
that
he
hated
the
idea
of
her
letting
simon
court
her
and
yet
from
the
time
he
first
encountered
simon
he
had
made
it
equally
obvious
that
he
expected
sophia
to
do
whatever
was
necessary
to
make
simon
fall
in
love
with
her
and
from
the
moment
simon
had
kissed
her
in
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
atrium
he
had
loved
her
and
never
stopped
loving
her
but
to
make
him
love
her
she
had
pretended
to
be
an
innocent
young
sicilian
woman
who
could
be
overwhelmed
by
her
love
for
a
french
nobleman
sadly
enough
she
felt
more
joy
and
peace
of
mind
as
that
sicilian
girl
than
she
ever
had
known
as
a
woman
of
byzantium
and
the
confusion
about
who
she
really
was
had
become
much
worse
after
she
decided
to
keep
secret
from
daoud
simon
destination
when
he
left
orvieto
she
felt
a
pounding
pain
inside
her
skull
and
she
pressed
her
hands
against
her
hair
she
shut
her
eyes
so
tight
that
she
forced
tears
from
them
and
a
little
groan
escaped
her
she
was
sure
of
one
thing
if
she
had
much
more
to
do
with
simon
de
gobignon
the
confusion
she
felt
would
probably
drive
her
mad
she
fumbled
through
her
chest
and
found
a
winter
cloak
lined
with
red
squirrel
fur
she
threw
it
over
her
shoulders
and
clasped
it
around
her
neck
the
fur
collar
gently
brushing
her
chin
simon
was
waiting
where
she
had
left
him
he
had
allowed
his
bright
blue
cloak
to
fall
closed
around
his
lanky
frame
so
that
he
looked
like
a
pillar
she
wrapped
her
own
cloak
around
herself
and
side
by
side
they
walked
to
the
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
they
said
nothing
to
each
other
until
they
were
out
on
the
loggia
under
a
gray
sky
a
chill
wind
stung
sophia
cheeks
she
looked
down
at
the
rows
of
fruit
trees
in
the
atrium
below
their
bare
branches
reached
up
at
her
like
long
slender
fingers
i
can
not
understand
you
he
said
why
have
you
been
so
cruel
to
me
that
sounded
like
typical
courtly
lover
talk
but
she
knew
he
meant
the
words
literally
she
looked
at
his
face
and
saw
the
whiteness
the
strain
around
his
mouth
the
slight
tremor
of
his
lips
he
looked
like
a
mortally
wounded
man
i
cruel
to
you
did
i
not
beg
you
to
stay
away
from
my
uncle
look
what
you
have
done
today
he
will
send
me
to
siracusa
for
certain
but
she
felt
something
break
inside
her
at
the
sight
of
his
pain
she
had
done
this
to
him
she
had
hoped
to
give
him
something
by
letting
him
possess
her
one
time
to
make
up
for
all
that
she
could
never
give
him
instead
with
the
gift
of
her
body
she
had
bound
him
to
her
more
tightly
than
ever
and
then
haunted
by
her
own
feelings
and
the
memory
of
what
they
had
done
together
she
had
simply
tried
to
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
him
and
now
her
effort
to
break
with
him
was
hurting
both
of
them
far
more
than
if
she
had
refused
him
that
day
you
drove
me
to
this
he
said
his
eyes
wide
with
anger
you
did
not
answer
my
letters
or
acknowledge
my
poems
when
i
tried
to
speak
to
you
in
the
street
and
in
church
you
avoided
me
i
sent
you
gifts
and
you
sent
them
back
she
really
would
have
to
get
out
of
perugia
back
to
daoud
this
would
tear
her
to
pieces
what
about
rachel
if
she
left
perugia
that
would
be
as
good
as
abandoning
rachel
she
had
sworn
to
herself
never
to
do
that
guards
the
tartars
he
must
know
what
has
happened
to
rachel
perhaps
he
can
help
she
stopped
walking
and
leaned
against
the
stone
railing
of
the
loggia
the
leafless
branches
in
the
atrium
below
them
rattled
in
the
wind
there
are
many
reasons
that
i
did
not
want
to
see
you
i
do
not
know
whether
you
would
understand
all
of
them
but
one
is
that
i
have
heard
something
very
ugly
about
those
tartars
of
yours
she
had
decided
not
to
admit
that
she
knew
rachel
that
would
take
too
much
explaining
and
too
many
more
lies
and
the
lies
would
be
like
hidden
holes
in
a
path
to
trip
her
up
one
of
the
tartars
those
men
you
guard
so
carefully
kidnapped
a
young
girl
from
orvieto
and
is
holding
her
a
prisoner
now
here
in
perugia
at
the
baglioni
palace
it
makes
me
unhappy
to
know
that
you
are
the
protector
of
men
who
would
do
such
things
down
below
two
of
ugolini
servants
brought
out
baskets
of
newly
washed
tablecloths
and
bedlinens
and
began
spreading
them
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
to
dry
sophia
spoke
in
a
lower
voice
giving
details
of
the
attack
on
tilia
house
by
de
verceuil
and
the
tartars
as
if
it
were
something
she
knew
about
only
through
hearsay
while
simon
looked
more
and
more
unhappy
he
frowned
at
her
i
know
of
this
girl
it
is
john
chagan
who
keeps
her
but
what
is
she
to
you
she
is
not
even
a
christian
i
am
surprised
that
a
woman
of
good
family
like
you
should
worry
about
a
prostitute
how
easy
for
a
count
to
look
down
on
a
girl
like
rachel
she
felt
her
back
stiffen
with
anger
he
would
despise
me
if
he
knew
what
i
what
am
i
does
it
lower
me
in
your
eyes
that
i
worry
about
such
a
girl
he
waved
his
hands
placatingly
no
no
such
charitable
feelings
do
you
credit
i
like
to
help
her
and
i
know
friar
mathieu
has
already
tried
i
just
wondered
how
came
to
know
and
care
about
this
case
he
looked
earnestly
into
her
eyes
his
eyes
were
a
blue
as
clear
and
bright
as
that
lake
where
they
had
lain
together
the
story
is
talked
about
by
all
the
servants
and
common
folk
of
the
town
i
feel
very
sorry
for
her
she
is
just
a
child
i
find
myself
imagining
how
she
feels
kidnapped
helpless
raped
by
this
barbarian
a
prisoner
have
you
not
seen
her
yourself
simon
nodded
reluctantly
looking
away
yes
glimpses
she
stays
in
her
room
she
is
forced
to
stay
in
her
room
sophia
sensed
that
simon
knew
more
than
he
admitted
about
what
the
tartar
had
done
to
rachel
and
was
ashamed
to
be
connected
with
it
what
has
this
to
do
with
you
and
me
he
demanded
you
are
close
to
the
tartars
you
might
be
able
to
help
her
simon
glowered
if
i
had
been
there
that
day
in
orvieto
you
may
be
sure
they
would
not
have
raided
that
brothel
he
might
be
on
the
enemy
side
she
thought
but
he
was
not
a
savage
like
the
franks
of
her
childhood
he
was
a
genuinely
good
man
and
that
was
what
made
the
hopeless
dream
of
marrying
him
so
painful
she
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
squeezed
will
you
try
to
get
the
tartar
to
release
the
girl
cardinal
ugolini
will
take
her
in
when
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
hard
wiry
muscle
in
his
arm
she
did
not
want
to
let
go
still
want
him
my
god
what
is
the
matter
with
me
de
verceuil
would
oppose
me
if
i
tried
to
take
the
girl
away
from
john
incredible
is
it
not
a
cardinal
involved
in
kidnapping
a
young
girl
for
the
pleasure
of
a
barbarian
sophia
taught
by
her
greek
orthodox
priests
that
the
roman
church
was
a
fountainhead
of
wickedness
did
not
think
the
cardinal
actions
all
that
incredible
besides
was
she
not
in
league
with
another
cardinal
who
was
helping
the
muslims
there
be
a
way
to
help
rachel
she
said
he
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
sophia
i
will
speak
to
friar
mathieu
but
as
i
said
he
has
already
tried
to
persuade
john
to
let
the
girl
go
free
with
no
success
and
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
more
friar
mathieu
can
do
before
tomorrow
when
i
leave
perugia
she
loved
that
serious
intent
look
it
was
as
if
light
were
coming
from
his
eyes
but
what
he
had
just
said
took
her
by
surprise
leave
perugia
where
are
you
going
he
shook
his
head
no
one
is
supposed
to
know
simon
she
put
anger
into
her
voice
knowing
he
was
vulnerable
if
she
could
get
some
information
of
use
to
daoud
from
him
she
would
have
an
excuse
for
having
let
simon
make
love
to
her
and
with
daoud
far
away
in
manfred
kingdom
there
was
no
chance
this
time
that
he
could
hurt
simon
he
touched
her
cheek
with
the
tips
of
his
long
fingers
and
she
could
feel
him
struggling
with
himself
swear
you
will
tell
no
one
of
course
really
thinks
i
can
be
depended
upon
to
keep
an
all
right
i
had
a
message
from
count
charles
he
who
gave
me
this
task
of
guarding
the
tartars
he
calls
me
to
meet
him
at
ostia
that
is
why
i
came
here
today
even
though
i
knew
you
would
not
want
me
to
knowing
i
would
be
leaving
here
and
might
not
see
you
for
months
made
me
desperate
charles
at
ostia
the
seaport
of
rome
as
she
realized
what
simon
words
meant
terror
raced
through
sophia
she
was
going
to
fall
from
the
loggia
and
break
into
a
thousand
pieces
like
an
icicle
anjou
was
going
to
take
rome
and
cut
italy
in
half
instead
of
trying
to
cross
the
alps
and
then
fight
his
way
through
the
ghibellino
cities
of
northern
italy
charles
must
have
come
by
sea
now
he
would
be
able
to
strike
directly
at
the
heart
of
manfred
kingdom
will
daoud
do
what
will
happen
to
manfred
if
only
we
had
tilia
here
with
her
carrier
despite
her
cloak
a
chill
seized
her
she
had
feared
for
daoud
that
he
might
have
to
fight
a
great
french
army
and
though
she
had
long
since
ceased
to
love
manfred
she
had
feared
for
him
and
his
kingdom
but
the
thought
of
the
many
obstacles
between
france
and
southern
italy
had
comforted
her
now
knowing
that
charles
was
so
close
to
manfred
kingdom
she
felt
herself
actually
trembling
he
put
his
hand
on
hers
you
frightened
staring
down
at
the
bare
trees
she
whispered
yes
for
my
people
his
hand
gripped
hers
tightly
he
bent
down
so
that
he
was
speaking
softly
into
her
ear
i
know
you
can
not
forget
your
people
but
you
could
escape
this
war
my
service
is
done
now
that
the
new
pope
has
confirmed
the
alliance
with
the
tartars
i
do
not
have
to
stay
in
italy
she
was
glad
he
did
not
want
to
fight
for
charles
the
thought
of
him
and
daoud
meeting
on
a
battlefield
was
horrible
but
surely
this
brother
of
king
louis
would
make
every
effort
to
draw
simon
into
the
war
count
charles
will
want
you
to
fight
if
you
will
marry
me
and
come
to
gobignon
nothing
else
will
matter
to
me
we
will
live
content
in
my
castle
in
the
heart
of
my
domain
we
will
shut
out
the
world
and
its
wars
she
turned
to
look
at
him
and
the
longing
on
his
face
was
painful
to
see
she
felt
the
tears
coming
hot
blurring
her
vision
simon
i
can
not
his
grip
on
her
hand
was
painful
again
and
again
you
say
that
to
me
and
you
never
tell
me
are
you
secretly
a
nun
have
you
taken
vows
does
your
husband
still
live
i
demand
that
you
tell
me
stop
tormenting
me
like
this
his
usually
pale
face
was
suddenly
scarlet
with
rage
his
anger
dried
up
her
tears
know
how
i
can
put
an
end
to
i
will
simon
but
i
am
not
ready
to
speak
of
it
today
then
go
now
and
meet
your
count
charles
at
ostia
by
the
time
you
come
back
to
the
papal
court
we
will
probably
have
moved
to
viterbo
and
when
i
see
you
again
i
will
tell
you
why
i
can
not
marry
you
the
shadow
cleared
from
his
face
do
you
promise
with
all
your
heart
and
if
i
can
persuade
you
that
your
reason
is
not
good
enough
then
will
you
marry
me
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
even
though
her
life
depended
on
deceiving
him
she
could
not
bear
to
make
such
a
promise
but
then
she
saw
that
she
could
honestly
agree
to
what
he
asked
if
you
still
want
me
to
marry
you
yes
can
say
that
because
if
you
ever
come
to
know
my
true
reason
for
not
marrying
you
you
will
hate
me
more
than
you
have
ever
hated
anyone
in
your
he
left
her
soon
afterward
she
went
back
to
her
room
and
cried
for
most
of
the
afternoon
every
so
often
she
looked
up
to
see
the
icon
of
the
desert
saint
staring
at
her
she
saw
the
same
reproach
in
simon
stylites
eyes
that
she
had
seen
in
simon
de
gobignon
lxi
though
the
day
was
cold
and
damp
the
sky
an
ugly
unwelcoming
gray
simon
first
view
of
rome
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
came
out
of
a
small
grove
of
cypresses
on
the
east
bank
of
the
tiber
to
see
gray
walls
punctuated
by
square
towers
spread
wide
before
him
beyond
the
walls
out
of
a
haze
of
dust
and
wood
smoke
above
masses
of
peaked
roofs
crenellated
palace
towers
rose
lordly
vying
for
ascendancy
with
the
bell
towers
of
churches
marble
buildings
adorned
with
white
columns
crowned
the
hills
the
brown
river
on
his
left
bent
around
the
walls
and
disappeared
beyond
them
even
though
he
did
not
want
to
be
part
of
charles
invasion
of
italy
the
thrill
of
seeing
rome
for
the
first
time
made
up
for
his
distress
rome
was
by
no
means
as
beautiful
a
sight
as
orvieto
but
it
awed
him
to
think
that
this
city
had
ruled
the
world
when
jesus
walked
the
earth
what
must
it
have
been
like
to
be
a
roman
legionary
returning
to
this
place
from
a
victory
in
some
land
this
dirt
track
would
have
been
a
road
then
looking
off
to
his
right
he
saw
fragments
of
wall
bounding
the
edge
of
a
field
and
a
broken
fluted
column
rising
among
olive
trees
quiet
reminders
that
the
city
had
once
extended
into
these
fields
and
beyond
simon
was
mounted
on
a
borrowed
a
mare
whose
shiny
coat
reminded
him
of
sophia
hair
a
brown
so
dark
it
might
be
taken
for
black
after
many
hours
of
riding
the
mare
rocking
pace
had
chafed
the
insides
of
his
legs
he
rode
a
few
yards
behind
count
charles
and
the
three
knights
charles
had
appointed
marshals
of
his
army
when
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
a
column
of
mailed
knights
riding
three
abreast
strung
out
along
the
tiber
for
nearly
half
a
mile
and
beyond
them
almost
obscured
by
clouds
of
yellow
dust
clinking
files
of
crossbows
and
spears
over
their
shoulders
unimpressed
by
the
sight
of
rome
anjou
and
his
commanders
carried
on
an
argument
you
are
a
hard
taskmaster
monseigneur
said
gautier
du
mont
whose
bronze
hair
was
cropped
in
the
shape
of
a
bowl
slightly
tilted
so
that
the
back
was
lower
than
the
front
to
make
your
knights
ride
half
a
day
in
full
armor
when
they
have
not
seen
a
denier
from
your
coffers
since
we
sailed
from
marseilles
you
demand
too
much
the
points
of
du
mustache
hung
below
his
chin
simon
had
heard
he
was
little
better
than
a
routier
a
highwayman
who
had
begun
his
knightly
career
by
robbing
travelers
who
passed
his
castle
in
the
pyrenees
what
simon
had
seen
thus
far
of
charles
army
made
the
enterprise
look
decidedly
unsavory
before
reaching
ostia
simon
had
expected
that
the
men
charles
commanded
would
be
vassals
men
who
had
received
land
from
him
and
were
bound
by
ancient
oaths
he
quickly
realized
that
all
of
these
men
were
adventurers
with
little
or
no
holdings
of
their
own
in
this
enterprise
with
charles
for
whatever
they
could
gain
charles
could
command
them
only
as
long
as
they
could
hope
to
grow
rich
in
his
service
simon
supposed
this
was
the
best
charles
could
do
since
king
louis
had
refused
to
help
him
raise
knights
and
men
and
insisted
that
he
hire
them
himself
knights
willing
to
go
to
war
for
hire
could
not
be
expected
to
be
the
better
sort
not
only
did
simon
not
want
to
make
war
on
the
italians
he
wanted
even
less
to
be
associated
with
men
like
the
ones
charles
had
recruited
unlike
his
three
marshals
who
were
all
bareheaded
charles
wore
a
helmet
a
steel
replica
of
his
count
coronet
ringed
its
pointed
top
beside
him
rode
an
equerry
with
his
personal
standard
the
black
silhouette
of
a
lion
rearing
up
on
its
hind
legs
against
a
background
charles
turned
so
that
his
big
capetian
nose
was
outlined
against
the
sky
you
complain
du
mont
because
i
ordered
our
knights
to
wear
full
armor
said
charles
i
did
it
for
their
own
protection
i
expect
to
meet
resistance
eight
hundred
knights
and
two
thousand
simon
thought
enough
to
take
rome
if
the
romans
do
decide
to
fight
nowhere
near
enough
to
beat
he
had
been
shocked
when
he
arrived
at
ostia
last
night
and
found
out
how
small
charles
invasion
force
was
being
a
part
of
this
war
was
going
to
be
downright
dangerous
time
enough
for
us
to
don
armor
when
the
resistance
appears
said
alistair
fitztrinian
a
knight
from
england
whose
face
was
a
mass
of
smallpox
scars
simon
had
so
far
been
unable
to
look
at
the
man
without
having
to
freeze
the
muscles
of
his
face
to
keep
from
wincing
count
charles
sighed
and
held
out
his
arm
in
the
direction
of
rome
look
there
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
patient
tone
as
if
instructing
schoolchildren
the
romans
are
not
waiting
for
us
to
put
on
our
armor
simon
followed
his
pointing
finger
and
saw
a
gray
mass
spreading
out
into
the
field
near
one
of
the
city
gates
flowing
around
cottages
and
groves
of
trees
it
appeared
to
be
a
great
crowd
of
several
thousand
citizens
fully
alert
now
simon
heard
a
dull
roar
like
the
hum
of
a
swarm
of
bees
that
sounded
decidedly
hostile
he
felt
a
twinge
of
fear
get
your
helmets
on
the
three
of
you
charles
snapped
set
an
example
for
the
rest
or
may
the
devil
carry
you
away
the
three
commanders
slowly
and
sullenly
pulled
on
their
helmets
which
had
been
hanging
down
their
backs
from
straps
under
their
chins
the
manner
of
the
three
marshals
toward
count
charles
shocked
simon
if
these
were
the
leaders
what
in
god
name
could
the
rank
and
file
be
like
one
of
my
venetian
archers
or
the
tartars
armenian
guards
would
be
worth
a
dozen
of
as
the
army
of
anjou
with
charles
and
simon
and
the
three
marshals
in
the
lead
advanced
slowly
simon
noticed
that
six
or
so
men
several
hundred
paces
in
front
of
the
shouting
citizens
were
walking
to
meet
them
in
a
short
time
the
small
delegation
stood
before
count
charles
blocking
his
path
charles
raised
his
arm
and
the
knights
behind
him
shouted
the
order
to
halt
down
the
line
how
would
count
charles
deal
with
the
representatives
of
an
unfriendly
populace
simon
wondered
this
should
be
interesting
he
might
learn
something
the
count
turned
to
dietrich
von
regensburg
his
third
commander
i
want
a
troop
of
the
burgundian
pikemen
up
here
now
surround
these
fellows
von
regensburg
a
knight
with
hard
blue
eyes
a
flattened
nose
and
a
huge
jaw
saluted
and
swung
his
dun
horse
around
to
ride
back
to
the
long
line
of
following
charles
and
his
knights
anjou
order
made
simon
uneasy
why
try
to
frighten
these
romans
would
it
not
be
better
if
he
could
enter
the
city
with
their
approval
then
he
beckoned
simon
to
bring
his
horse
up
beside
him
no
doubt
you
speak
italian
better
than
any
of
us
translate
for
me
he
glowered
down
his
long
nose
at
the
romans
who
had
approached
him
i
am
count
charles
i
have
come
here
as
protector
of
the
city
of
rome
at
the
request
of
his
holiness
the
pope
simon
repeated
this
rome
needs
protection
only
from
you
one
of
the
men
shouted
there
is
no
pope
another
called
out
the
old
one
is
dead
and
the
new
one
has
not
been
crowned
simon
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
he
had
heard
that
roman
citizens
were
unruly
that
was
why
the
pope
had
moved
away
from
rome
but
the
way
these
men
addressed
the
count
of
anjou
the
brother
of
the
king
of
france
it
was
unthinkable
it
was
madness
the
count
might
not
understand
their
words
but
the
disrespectful
tone
was
unmistakable
hesitantly
he
translated
charles
stared
at
the
six
romans
his
swarthy
face
expressionless
charles
great
black
and
white
shifted
his
legs
restlessly
and
charles
stilled
him
with
a
jerk
of
the
reins
even
the
horse
sensed
the
romans
anger
silencio
ordered
a
roman
somewhat
taller
than
the
others
with
a
shock
of
hair
and
an
angular
jaw
he
wore
a
mantle
of
deep
maroon
velvet
trimmed
with
white
fur
and
a
longsword
hung
from
his
jeweled
belt
he
bowed
courteously
to
count
charles
and
simon
your
signory
i
am
leone
pedulla
secretary
of
the
senate
of
rome
we
come
with
all
respect
to
pray
you
to
turn
back
the
city
of
rome
rules
herself
we
are
most
distressed
to
see
a
foreign
army
a
french
army
approaching
our
walls
if
you
wish
to
visit
us
and
confer
with
our
leading
citizens
leave
this
army
behind
come
to
us
as
a
guest
bringing
a
few
of
your
barons
with
you
we
will
then
offer
you
our
hospitality
we
ask
you
to
leave
us
in
peace
simon
wished
himself
far
away
as
he
translated
for
anjou
these
romans
did
not
know
count
charles
as
simon
was
conveying
leone
pedulla
speech
a
line
of
big
bearded
foot
soldiers
carrying
spears
taller
than
a
man
wearing
leather
cuirasses
and
helmets
of
polished
steel
marched
forward
boots
crunching
on
the
stubble
of
the
harvested
field
at
von
regensburg
command
the
pikemen
formed
a
ring
around
the
roman
delegation
the
romans
eyes
darted
anxiously
from
side
to
side
charles
said
simon
tell
this
impertinent
fellow
who
calls
himself
secretary
of
the
senate
just
this
i
order
him
to
clear
away
that
rabble
blocking
the
city
gates
simon
repeated
the
count
command
in
italian
his
heart
began
to
beat
more
rapidly
as
he
sensed
an
evil
moment
coming
closer
and
closer
the
people
standing
before
the
walls
are
citizens
of
rome
your
signory
acting
legally
to
protect
the
city
from
what
seems
to
us
a
foreign
invader
pedulla
answered
i
can
not
tell
them
to
go
away
simon
wished
he
could
soften
this
when
he
translated
it
charles
mouth
drew
down
in
a
harsh
inverted
very
well
he
turned
to
von
regensburg
and
pointed
i
would
prefer
to
hang
them
but
it
would
take
too
long
use
your
spears
on
them
merciful
god
do
not
let
this
happen
simon
prayed
no
pedulla
cried
his
voice
shrill
with
horror
as
the
german
knight
shouted
a
command
and
the
burgundians
leveled
their
spears
it
was
the
roman
last
word
his
hand
had
not
quite
reached
the
hilt
of
his
sword
when
a
bearlike
foot
soldier
lunged
at
him
driving
a
spear
through
his
embroidered
tunic
into
his
chest
the
pikeman
thrust
the
steel
point
in
low
enough
to
miss
the
breastbone
but
high
enough
to
pierce
the
heart
pedulla
did
not
even
have
time
enough
to
finish
his
scream
clemenza
per
favore
cried
another
roman
who
a
moment
ago
had
been
shouting
defiance
a
spear
point
caught
him
in
the
throat
simon
wished
he
could
turn
his
eyes
away
but
he
did
not
want
charles
and
his
marshals
to
think
him
squeamish
his
heart
thundered
and
his
stomach
churned
and
he
feared
that
his
body
would
betray
him
the
other
pikemen
moved
in
quickly
taking
long
steps
as
if
performing
spear
drill
holding
their
pikes
near
the
points
for
close
work
a
moment
later
they
stepped
back
from
a
heap
of
sprawled
dead
bodies
how
little
time
it
takes
to
kill
a
man
now
simon
did
look
away
the
blood
the
staring
dead
faces
the
twisted
arms
and
legs
were
too
pitiful
a
sight
to
bear
simon
remembered
de
verceuil
ordering
the
archers
to
shoot
into
the
crowd
at
orvieto
this
was
worse
these
men
had
been
discourteous
perhaps
but
they
were
officials
of
the
city
on
an
embassy
and
count
charles
had
ordered
them
killed
as
calmly
as
he
might
order
his
army
to
break
camp
this
was
the
man
whose
wishes
had
governed
simon
life
for
over
a
year
simon
felt
his
bond
to
charles
as
a
terrible
chain
and
he
longed
to
be
free
is
a
taste
of
what
will
happen
to
sophia
people
if
charles
conquers
manfred
if
only
she
will
let
me
take
her
to
gobignon
so
she
will
not
have
to
see
such
count
charles
raised
a
hand
encased
in
a
gleaming
mail
glove
forward
one
moment
monseigneur
said
gautier
du
mont
his
sharp
voice
cutting
through
the
sounds
of
the
army
resuming
its
march
charles
turned
to
him
impatiently
what
now
du
mont
monseigneur
we
have
just
killed
the
emissaries
of
the
romans
i
fear
we
will
now
have
to
fight
that
mob
look
they
are
coming
at
us
simon
looked
over
toward
the
city
the
mass
that
had
emerged
from
the
city
a
long
line
of
people
stretching
eastward
from
the
tiber
to
a
distant
forest
was
moving
through
the
fields
and
olive
groves
to
simon
eye
they
appeared
to
vastly
outnumber
charles
army
simon
could
see
swords
gleaming
and
spears
waving
they
formed
no
ranks
and
files
as
a
professional
army
would
but
they
came
on
inexorably
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
their
shouts
were
angry
simon
felt
cold
fear
sweep
away
the
sick
pity
he
had
felt
for
the
executed
roman
delegation
that
huge
mob
was
a
formidable
sight
of
course
we
will
fight
them
du
mont
charles
answered
his
voice
rising
one
charge
and
we
will
scatter
them
to
the
winds
true
thought
simon
crowds
of
villeins
or
peasants
were
no
match
for
disciplined
fighting
men
but
just
how
disciplined
was
the
force
behind
charles
i
think
monseigneur
said
du
mont
that
before
we
do
any
fighting
it
is
appropriate
to
discuss
the
terms
of
our
payment
by
god
white
beard
simon
swore
to
himself
they
were
about
to
be
attacked
by
five
or
more
times
their
number
and
these
bastards
were
arguing
about
money
they
ought
to
be
stripped
of
their
knighthoods
i
have
told
you
my
gold
shipment
was
late
getting
from
marseilles
to
ostia
said
charles
in
a
placating
tone
you
will
be
paid
tonight
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
it
will
catch
up
to
us
then
tonight
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
monseigneur
said
the
fitztrinian
you
can
command
us
to
charge
that
rabble
the
roman
mob
was
close
enough
now
for
simon
to
make
out
what
they
were
shouting
muorire
alla
francia
to
the
french
the
cry
sent
a
bolt
of
fear
through
simon
they
would
have
to
do
something
at
once
were
charles
lieutenants
actually
going
to
sit
on
their
motionless
horses
and
haggle
with
him
until
these
infuriated
romans
fell
upon
them
not
just
charles
venture
was
at
stake
but
their
own
lives
could
they
be
stupid
or
greedy
enough
to
let
themselves
be
overwhelmed
while
they
argued
about
money
they
could
be
that
stupid
and
that
simon
fear
transmuted
itself
to
anger
these
men
were
a
disgrace
to
chivalry
worse
as
marshals
of
an
army
commanded
by
king
brother
they
dishonored
france
he
almost
wanted
to
draw
his
sword
against
them
his
disgust
was
so
great
you
speak
of
dishonor
when
you
are
refusing
to
attack
an
enemy
in
the
field
at
the
order
of
your
seigneur
charles
shouted
we
are
not
refusing
monseigneur
alistair
fitztrinian
began
simon
had
heard
enough
if
charles
hired
commanders
would
not
command
he
would
follow
me
thierry
simon
swung
his
horse
around
to
ride
toward
the
rear
of
the
column
his
face
was
hot
with
anger
simon
felt
little
sympathy
for
charles
he
had
chosen
these
men
but
simon
de
gobignon
at
least
was
not
going
to
let
himself
be
set
upon
and
murdered
by
a
crowd
of
commoners
even
if
those
commoners
had
ample
justification
nor
was
he
going
to
allow
french
arms
if
these
blackguards
charles
had
hired
could
be
said
to
represent
french
arms
to
be
disgraced
he
had
learned
somewhat
about
leading
fighting
men
in
the
last
year
he
could
do
what
was
needful
since
no
one
else
seemed
about
to
he
galloped
past
the
files
of
mounted
knights
who
crowded
the
road
beside
the
tiber
beyond
them
were
the
foot
soldiers
if
those
burgundians
who
executed
the
roman
delegation
were
any
example
the
might
be
more
reliable
than
the
knights
simon
searched
the
column
for
the
sort
of
men
he
needed
he
saw
just
past
the
end
of
the
line
of
mounted
men
two
score
or
more
of
archers
in
blue
tunics
with
longbows
slung
over
their
backs
he
was
not
experienced
with
the
use
of
the
longbow
in
battle
but
what
he
had
heard
about
its
long
range
suggested
that
it
might
be
very
useful
just
now
he
shouted
the
archers
stared
at
him
and
drew
themselves
up
straighter
but
looked
puzzled
of
course
simon
thought
the
longbow
was
a
weapon
favored
by
the
english
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
and
the
englishmen
ran
to
him
good
my
lord
i
speak
un
peu
français
said
one
of
them
whose
crested
helmet
marked
him
as
a
sergeant
if
you
give
your
orders
to
me
very
slowly
good
said
simon
pleased
with
the
man
readiness
to
cooperate
he
explained
what
he
wanted
simon
called
again
to
the
longbowmen
and
their
sergeant
repeated
follow
me
in
english
he
trotted
off
keeping
the
dark
brown
mare
to
a
pace
that
would
allow
running
men
to
follow
him
when
they
came
to
charles
and
his
three
mutinous
lieutenants
still
arguing
the
roman
mob
had
advanced
close
enough
for
simon
to
be
able
to
make
out
individuals
they
were
almost
all
men
as
far
as
he
could
see
with
a
shouting
woman
here
and
there
and
mostly
dressed
in
the
plain
browns
and
grays
whites
and
blacks
of
common
folk
men
with
swords
and
spears
made
up
the
forefront
a
few
men
on
horseback
with
lances
and
banners
rode
on
the
flanks
of
the
mob
someone
was
carrying
a
red
and
white
banner
a
design
of
keys
and
towers
for
a
moment
simon
hesitated
he
did
not
want
to
kill
these
people
but
there
was
no
way
of
stopping
the
romans
and
no
one
else
was
able
or
willing
to
act
if
he
did
nothing
charles
army
would
be
destroyed
and
simon
would
probably
be
killed
along
with
everyone
else
he
remembered
something
roland
his
true
father
had
told
him
many
years
ago
one
who
wants
to
live
through
a
battle
can
afford
to
feel
sorry
for
the
men
he
is
trying
to
kill
make
sure
you
kill
them
first
and
then
you
can
mourn
for
them
putting
his
sympathy
for
the
romans
out
of
his
mind
simon
began
to
give
orders
to
his
archers
he
deployed
them
in
a
line
stretching
from
the
tiber
to
a
thick
grove
of
trees
to
the
east
through
their
sergeant
he
told
them
to
shoot
at
the
front
and
center
of
the
oncoming
romans
he
noticed
that
the
voices
of
count
charles
and
his
antagonists
had
fallen
silent
are
watching
he
thought
and
hoped
no
one
would
try
to
stop
him
when
the
englishmen
had
their
arrows
nocked
and
their
bows
drawn
and
aimed
simon
shouted
tirez
they
understood
that
well
enough
the
arrows
flew
in
flat
curves
across
the
narrowing
distance
between
count
charles
army
and
the
roman
citizens
simon
saw
men
falling
and
others
tripping
over
them
encore
simon
cried
but
then
looking
back
at
his
little
troop
of
archers
saw
to
his
surprise
that
the
englishmen
had
already
loaded
and
fired
a
second
time
he
had
not
known
that
the
longbow
could
be
fired
again
and
again
so
quickly
much
more
quickly
than
the
crossbow
screams
of
panic
and
pain
arose
from
the
mob
before
him
am
killing
poor
people
who
are
trying
to
defend
their
a
pang
of
shame
swept
through
him
and
he
hesitated
before
giving
the
next
order
but
he
remembered
roland
advice
the
longer
it
took
to
drive
these
romans
back
inside
their
gates
the
more
blood
would
be
shed
and
the
more
likely
that
lives
would
be
lost
on
his
side
fire
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
he
told
the
english
sergeant
the
arrows
arced
high
into
the
overcast
sky
and
fell
like
dark
streaks
of
rain
the
romans
were
milling
about
some
trying
to
help
the
wounded
some
running
away
some
shouting
orders
or
pleas
trying
to
control
the
confusion
simon
rode
out
in
front
of
the
bowmen
advance
and
keep
firing
he
called
to
the
sergeant
keep
it
up
keep
pushing
them
back
he
heard
an
arrow
whistle
past
him
so
the
romans
also
had
some
archers
among
them
he
was
too
excited
to
feel
any
fear
the
longbowmen
marched
out
into
the
field
stopping
at
intervals
to
load
and
fire
then
advancing
again
they
hardly
had
to
aim
anywhere
the
arrows
fell
in
the
mob
packed
closer
together
in
retreat
they
would
wound
or
kill
simon
heard
shouts
and
screams
of
terror
from
across
the
field
the
romans
were
falling
over
one
another
trying
to
get
away
none
of
the
poor
devils
was
wearing
armor
where
were
the
professional
defenders
of
the
city
simon
wondered
the
great
crowd
was
falling
back
toward
the
city
gates
like
the
debris
left
by
a
wave
receding
from
shore
bodies
dark
clumps
lay
thick
in
the
stubble
of
the
harvested
fields
simon
saw
a
man
throw
his
arms
around
the
trunk
of
an
olive
tree
and
slowly
slide
to
the
ground
he
saw
the
red
and
white
banner
fall
then
someone
pick
it
up
and
run
with
it
three
men
lay
draped
over
low
stone
walls
arms
and
legs
twitching
the
farmers
fields
between
count
charles
army
and
the
walls
of
rome
were
littered
with
the
dead
the
dying
and
the
struggling
wounded
simon
wanted
to
call
back
the
archers
he
felt
as
if
he
had
loosed
a
great
rock
from
the
top
of
a
hill
and
it
was
rolling
downward
unstoppable
destroying
everything
in
its
path
the
romans
were
running
desperately
and
the
pity
he
had
forced
himself
not
to
feel
while
he
was
fighting
them
rose
up
to
overwhelm
him
his
heart
lodged
in
his
throat
like
a
rock
and
tears
crept
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
god
name
what
have
i
done
magnificent
simon
you
did
admirably
charles
had
ridden
up
beside
him
and
was
grinning
out
at
the
carnage
in
the
fields
of
stubble
his
dark
eyes
were
alight
with
pleasure
he
struck
simon
on
his
mailed
back
one
of
those
hard
blows
he
was
fond
of
what
presence
of
mind
what
initiative
he
lowered
his
voice
you
could
not
have
done
better
if
we
had
planned
it
ahead
of
time
you
saved
me
a
fortune
in
gold
he
spurred
his
black
and
white
charger
closer
to
simon
mare
and
leaned
over
to
kiss
him
emphatically
on
the
cheek
his
stubble
scratching
simon
face
i
do
understand
said
simon
charles
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
with
narrowed
eyes
you
do
well
you
did
the
right
thing
we
talk
about
it
later
he
turned
and
shouted
at
his
three
commanders
you
see
idiots
one
french
knight
with
his
head
on
his
shoulders
can
do
what
all
of
you
and
all
your
knights
could
not
we
were
not
attempting
to
do
anything
du
mont
said
sourly
pushing
his
helmet
back
off
his
hair
those
were
the
bowmen
i
brought
from
lincoln
you
used
monseigneur
de
gobignon
said
fitztrinian
you
did
not
have
my
permission
in
his
present
mood
simon
wished
the
knight
would
make
an
issue
of
it
do
not
make
yourself
more
ridiculous
than
you
already
are
sire
alistair
said
charles
we
still
have
not
settled
this
question
of
pay
said
dietrich
of
regensburg
go
pick
the
purses
of
those
dead
men
out
there
said
charles
with
a
scornful
laugh
again
simon
was
sickened
by
charles
manner
he
had
expected
that
the
count
would
punish
his
rebellious
commanders
hanging
would
be
an
excellent
idea
flog
them
out
of
the
army
at
least
instead
he
continued
to
argue
with
them
even
banter
with
them
as
if
they
were
all
a
pack
of
merchants
in
a
money
changer
shop
to
get
away
from
the
wretched
business
simon
kicked
his
dark
brown
mare
into
motion
and
followed
by
thierry
rode
out
toward
the
city
he
wished
desperately
that
he
were
back
in
perugia
with
sophia
he
had
seen
enough
killing
in
orvieto
especially
the
night
of
the
attack
on
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
to
harden
him
still
it
made
his
heart
feel
heavy
as
stone
in
his
chest
to
see
so
many
lives
cut
short
and
by
his
command
what
pain
it
must
be
to
die
to
have
your
life
stopped
forever
he
recalled
the
arrow
that
had
whizzed
past
him
he
could
easily
have
been
killed
he
rode
toward
the
walls
of
rome
until
they
towered
over
him
the
crowd
of
citizens
who
had
come
out
to
stop
count
charles
was
gone
those
able
to
flee
there
were
only
the
dead
and
dying
scattered
in
the
stubble
field
around
him
simon
tried
to
avoid
looking
at
the
wounded
if
it
had
been
one
or
two
men
as
it
had
been
that
day
at
orvieto
when
de
verceuil
ordered
the
crossbowmen
to
fire
into
the
crowd
he
would
have
tried
to
help
them
but
there
were
too
many
here
his
contingent
of
english
archers
marched
past
him
on
their
way
back
to
the
main
army
their
work
done
they
gave
him
a
cheer
and
he
in
spite
of
his
heavy
heart
did
as
a
good
leader
should
and
smiled
and
waved
good
work
my
friends
well
done
he
looked
ahead
again
and
saw
that
the
nearest
gate
the
one
through
which
most
of
the
retreating
citizens
had
run
hung
open
he
pulled
his
horse
to
a
stop
am
not
going
to
be
the
first
of
these
invaders
to
enter
rome
i
have
no
right
to
be
five
horsemen
appeared
suddenly
in
the
gateway
more
resistance
these
men
were
richly
dressed
their
scarlet
capes
billowing
as
they
rode
toward
him
their
hands
were
empty
of
weapons
the
rider
in
the
lead
was
a
man
with
a
glossy
black
beard
and
a
sharply
hooked
nose
he
reminded
simon
a
little
of
the
contessa
di
monaldeschi
i
am
duke
gaetano
orsini
said
the
bearded
man
these
gentlemen
represent
the
families
of
colonna
frangipani
papareschi
and
caetani
we
have
come
to
greet
count
charles
and
to
welcome
him
to
rome
these
men
simon
thought
must
come
from
some
of
the
families
whose
fortified
towers
loomed
over
the
city
their
sudden
appearance
made
simon
angry
it
was
all
happening
backward
they
should
have
come
out
first
and
made
peace
with
count
charles
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
all
this
butchery
simon
identified
himself
i
will
take
you
to
count
charles
the
roman
nobles
doffed
their
velvet
caps
to
simon
and
he
touched
the
brim
of
his
helmet
as
their
horses
trotted
across
the
field
simon
observed
orsini
gaze
traveling
coldly
over
the
bodies
of
the
fallen
romans
some
of
them
still
alive
called
out
to
him
pleadingly
he
ignored
them
simon
could
not
resist
saying
if
you
had
come
out
to
welcome
count
charles
before
these
others
did
much
bloodshed
might
have
been
prevented
orsini
shrugged
necessary
bloodshed
the
mob
that
threatened
count
charles
was
incited
by
the
ghibellino
faction
in
rome
they
tried
to
get
the
city
militia
to
join
them
but
we
held
the
professionals
back
indeed
we
have
heard
you
killed
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
popolo
minuto
the
lower
orders
leone
pedulla
that
was
well
done
his
loss
will
be
a
blessing
to
this
city
as
will
the
loss
of
these
other
troublemakers
simon
felt
as
disgusted
with
this
man
as
he
had
with
charles
marshals
unable
to
keep
order
in
their
own
city
the
nobility
of
rome
approved
the
slaughter
of
their
people
by
foreign
invaders
it
was
despicable
count
charles
would
have
to
deal
with
them
but
he
himself
would
speak
no
more
to
these
poltroons
who
called
themselves
gentlemen
they
rode
in
silence
toward
the
advancing
angevin
army
of
count
charles
the
count
black
and
red
lion
banner
fluttered
over
his
steel
coronet
he
was
riding
toward
rome
again
with
his
commanders
behind
him
as
if
all
their
differences
were
settled
charles
and
his
leaders
reined
up
before
the
new
delegation
from
rome
the
count
of
anjou
greeted
these
representatives
of
the
great
families
of
rome
with
courtesy
dismounting
and
embracing
gaetano
orsini
he
assured
each
roman
nobleman
simon
interpreting
how
happy
he
was
to
see
him
i
believe
it
would
be
best
if
my
men
and
i
were
to
camp
outside
the
city
walls
for
tonight
he
said
looking
down
his
large
nose
at
orsini
i
was
just
about
to
suggest
that
said
orsini
the
city
is
quite
crowded
perhaps
less
crowded
now
charles
laughed
with
a
nod
at
the
fields
where
wailing
men
and
women
were
walking
trying
to
find
their
dead
and
bear
them
away
for
burial
at
any
rate
i
will
enter
the
city
tomorrow
all
will
be
prepared
for
your
signory
the
loyal
supporters
of
the
parte
guelfo
are
eager
to
greet
you
you
will
be
made
an
honorary
patrician
there
will
be
banners
cheering
crowds
music
the
militia
will
parade
for
you
it
will
be
a
true
roman
triumph
orsini
was
all
smiles
and
flourishes
charles
smiled
a
triumph
yes
and
i
assume
that
a
triumph
will
include
tribute
orsini
smile
faded
tribute
charles
nodded
slowly
to
be
exact
i
will
require
three
thousand
florins
to
be
delivered
to
me
tomorrow
morning
before
i
enter
the
city
to
compensate
my
men
whose
pay
is
in
arrears
i
will
have
further
requirements
but
i
will
not
press
you
for
all
at
once
three
thousand
florins
will
be
enough
for
tomorrow
simon
saw
von
regensburg
and
fitztrinian
grinning
at
each
other
orsini
mouth
worked
several
times
after
simon
translated
demand
for
three
thousand
florins
but
your
signory
we
welcome
you
as
our
protector
not
as
one
who
comes
to
to
take
from
us
charles
laughed
and
threw
his
arms
wide
protectors
cost
money
my
dear
orsini
i
am
sure
the
great
city
of
rome
can
scrape
together
three
thousand
florins
by
tomorrow
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
send
my
army
into
the
city
to
help
you
find
the
money
will
it
not
at
all
necessary
your
signory
said
orsini
bowing
his
face
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
black
beard
these
guelfo
nobles
apparently
had
thought
that
the
count
of
anjou
had
come
to
rome
purely
out
of
some
desire
to
serve
the
pope
and
the
church
simon
thought
they
were
starting
to
learn
what
simon
himself
had
gradually
come
to
realize
that
count
charles
did
nothing
that
did
not
first
and
foremost
benefit
himself
as
for
himself
simon
deepest
wish
was
to
get
away
from
all
this
slaughter
and
pillage
and
dishonor
and
the
sooner
the
better
rome
is
an
old
whore
who
lies
down
for
every
strong
man
who
comes
along
said
count
charles
all
we
needed
was
to
show
our
resolution
when
that
mob
came
at
us
and
rome
fell
over
backward
the
two
men
sat
across
from
each
other
at
a
small
camp
table
in
charles
tent
sharing
wine
and
succulent
roast
pork
killed
and
cooked
by
anjou
equerries
simon
stared
into
the
flames
of
a
candlestick
standing
on
charles
armor
chest
at
the
side
of
the
tent
and
thought
that
he
would
far
rather
be
exploring
the
wonders
of
rome
he
had
heard
so
much
about
the
colosseum
the
lateran
palace
the
forum
the
catacombs
simon
remembered
his
mother
warning
of
years
ago
uses
how
often
with
charles
had
he
suspected
feared
that
she
was
right
but
those
boyhood
years
in
charles
household
weapons
training
under
charles
his
feeling
that
king
louis
was
a
sort
of
father
to
him
and
count
charles
a
sort
of
uncle
all
made
him
want
to
trust
charles
but
it
was
becoming
impossible
to
do
that
especially
since
avignon
when
charles
asked
him
to
betray
the
king
confidence
even
now
though
he
wished
they
could
get
back
on
their
old
footing
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
that
old
footing
had
been
an
illusion
perhaps
all
along
charles
had
been
kind
to
him
only
the
better
to
use
him
he
was
terribly
afraid
that
he
knew
what
charles
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
tonight
he
had
seen
the
sorry
quality
of
charles
army
and
he
had
been
impelled
almost
against
his
will
to
take
the
lead
when
the
roman
mob
was
attacking
if
simon
were
in
charles
position
he
knew
what
he
would
want
you
did
just
the
right
thing
today
simon
charles
said
those
three
cutthroats
would
never
have
let
themselves
be
overrun
nor
would
i
but
i
had
paid
them
in
a
while
no
fault
of
mine
and
they
saw
that
as
an
excuse
to
try
to
extract
a
promise
from
me
of
an
additional
monthly
five
florins
per
knight
and
increases
for
the
common
soldiers
as
well
they
thought
the
sight
of
that
mob
would
force
me
to
yield
to
them
their
refusal
to
act
was
a
simon
thought
but
he
began
to
feel
disgusted
with
himself
of
all
of
them
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
been
duped
charles
went
on
they
were
testing
my
courage
they
did
not
know
me
well
they
know
me
better
now
i
would
have
stood
my
ground
until
they
were
forced
to
turn
and
defend
themselves
but
you
settled
things
by
taking
those
archers
out
into
the
field
and
driving
the
rabble
off
and
a
good
thing
you
did
because
the
situation
risky
they
might
have
waited
too
long
to
attack
and
we
might
have
lost
lives
unnecessarily
it
was
a
dangerous
game
they
were
playing
a
dangerous
game
you
were
simon
thought
he
leaned
forward
resting
his
elbows
on
the
table
charles
had
used
him
just
as
mother
had
warned
and
he
felt
angry
enough
to
speak
frankly
it
was
mutiny
in
my
opinion
you
should
have
hanged
those
men
they
are
little
better
than
routiers
but
all
you
did
was
haggle
with
them
sipping
from
his
goblet
charles
lounged
back
on
his
cot
and
laughed
ah
simon
i
forget
sometimes
that
you
have
never
been
in
a
war
this
is
the
way
it
always
is
especially
at
the
beginning
these
men
du
mont
fitztrinian
von
regensburg
and
their
followers
are
hirelings
and
when
one
goes
shopping
for
an
army
one
buys
not
the
best
there
is
but
only
the
best
that
is
on
the
market
simon
wanted
to
lean
back
as
charles
had
done
but
there
was
no
back
to
the
stool
he
sat
on
charles
furnishings
were
as
meager
as
everything
else
about
his
army
i
fear
for
you
uncle
i
really
do
not
only
are
your
knights
undisciplined
but
you
are
so
few
in
number
he
instantly
regretted
saying
that
it
would
give
charles
an
opening
to
ask
him
for
help
charles
smiled
complacently
and
you
think
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
with
his
host
of
saracens
and
sicilians
will
march
up
here
and
chew
me
up
is
that
it
well
perhaps
charles
swirled
his
wine
cup
and
drank
from
it
a
bigger
army
would
have
cost
me
far
more
to
ship
and
far
more
to
pay
feed
and
quarter
while
i
am
here
i
needed
this
much
of
an
army
to
establish
myself
in
rome
i
do
not
need
more
until
i
actually
make
war
on
manfred
and
that
may
be
as
much
as
a
year
from
now
tomorrow
i
will
enter
rome
in
triumph
and
i
will
have
myself
declared
chief
senator
of
rome
eventually
guy
le
gros
pope
clement
he
is
calling
himself
will
crown
me
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
as
my
renown
spreads
fighting
men
will
come
flocking
from
all
over
to
join
my
cause
and
they
will
have
to
come
in
on
my
terms
then
i
will
be
ready
to
march
south
the
whole
reason
charles
had
first
sent
simon
to
italy
to
engineer
the
conquest
of
the
saracens
by
christians
and
tartars
was
that
no
longer
important
to
him
charles
had
said
nothing
about
the
tartars
since
simon
arrived
in
ostia
last
night
the
new
holy
father
has
already
proclaimed
his
approval
of
the
tartar
alliance
simon
ventured
excellent
said
charles
nodding
he
stood
up
and
poured
more
wine
for
himself
and
simon
sitting
down
again
on
his
camp
bed
he
went
on
your
guardianship
of
the
tartars
too
has
been
superb
simon
you
proved
that
i
judged
wisely
in
picking
you
for
that
task
i
am
delighted
feeling
pleased
with
himself
simon
took
a
long
drink
of
the
heavy
red
roman
wine
then
since
the
pope
has
publicly
given
his
approval
shall
i
escort
the
tartars
to
your
brother
the
king
so
they
can
plan
the
crusade
the
crusade
charles
lay
back
on
his
cot
propped
up
on
one
elbow
and
stared
into
his
wine
cup
and
said
nothing
further
would
it
not
be
safest
to
conduct
them
to
the
king
at
once
simon
pressed
him
our
enemies
may
still
try
to
kill
them
even
though
the
alliance
is
proclaimed
charles
shook
his
head
the
last
attempt
to
kill
them
was
many
months
ago
true
simon
thought
the
stalker
in
black
seemed
to
have
given
up
or
disappeared
yes
but
that
sienese
attack
on
orvieto
charles
interrupted
de
verceuil
got
the
tartars
out
of
orvieto
safely
and
that
attack
was
aimed
at
the
pope
not
the
tartars
after
all
who
has
been
trying
to
kill
the
tartars
and
why
manfred
agents
because
they
knew
that
if
the
pope
approved
the
tartar
alliance
my
brother
would
then
give
me
permission
to
march
against
manfred
simon
remembered
king
louis
saying
he
wanted
to
be
ready
to
launch
his
crusade
by
now
only
five
years
away
but
preparations
for
a
crusade
take
many
years
simon
said
should
not
the
tartars
go
to
the
king
now
so
they
can
begin
to
plan
i
do
not
think
they
should
visit
my
brother
just
yet
said
charles
his
mind
so
easily
fills
up
with
dreams
of
recapturing
jerusalem
simon
caught
a
faint
note
of
mockery
in
charles
voice
the
presence
of
the
tartars
at
his
court
might
distract
him
from
his
more
immediate
responsibilities
then
what
will
we
do
with
the
tartars
simon
asked
nettled
let
them
remain
with
le
gros
court
in
viterbo
it
honors
the
pope
to
have
those
strange
men
from
the
unknown
east
at
his
coronation
then
when
he
comes
here
to
present
me
with
the
crown
let
them
come
too
as
my
guests
indeed
they
can
stay
with
me
after
that
they
will
be
safer
with
me
than
they
would
be
anywhere
else
in
italy
and
it
might
interest
them
to
see
how
christians
make
war
would
be
safer
still
in
he
could
have
taken
sophia
and
the
tartars
to
france
together
leaving
the
tartars
safe
and
well
guarded
with
king
louis
and
then
going
on
with
sophia
to
gobignon
and
getting
away
from
charles
and
his
war
how
many
more
months
will
i
have
to
stay
in
viterbo
guarding
the
tartars
he
said
with
some
irritation
charles
put
down
his
wine
goblet
suddenly
and
stood
up
he
seemed
to
fill
the
tent
the
candles
on
the
chest
lit
his
face
from
below
casting
ghastly
shadows
over
his
olive
complexion
simon
i
feel
i
can
speak
more
frankly
to
you
than
i
ever
have
it
is
nearly
two
years
since
i
asked
you
to
undertake
the
guarding
of
the
tartars
the
way
you
acted
today
showed
me
that
you
learned
a
great
deal
in
that
time
you
have
seen
the
world
you
have
seen
combat
you
have
learned
to
lead
praises
me
because
i
was
so
quick
to
mow
down
a
hundred
or
so
thought
simon
thank
you
uncle
he
said
tonelessly
i
did
not
summon
you
from
viterbo
just
so
you
could
accompany
me
from
ostia
to
rome
simon
you
saw
what
my
routiers
as
you
called
them
are
like
and
when
i
am
inside
the
city
i
will
be
in
much
greater
danger
from
that
roman
canaille
than
i
was
in
the
field
today
i
need
a
good
leader
with
me
whom
i
can
trust
i
want
you
to
stay
here
in
rome
with
me
simon
chest
ached
as
if
chains
were
wrapped
around
it
how
long
at
least
two
months
by
then
sire
adam
fourre
my
chief
vassal
from
anjou
will
be
here
with
seventy
knights
and
three
hundred
men
a
small
force
but
one
i
can
depend
on
i
will
feel
more
in
control
of
these
brigands
then
but
who
will
guard
the
tartars
while
i
am
here
he
asked
desperately
trying
to
think
of
an
excuse
that
would
get
him
back
to
sophia
charles
shrugged
de
verceuil
can
look
after
them
for
over
a
year
now
he
had
been
guarding
the
tartars
with
his
life
at
charles
request
now
charles
hardly
seemed
concerned
about
them
it
was
bewildering
when
will
i
see
sophia
again
he
cried
inwardly
he
could
simply
refuse
to
stay
in
italy
a
moment
longer
he
could
just
get
up
right
now
and
leave
go
to
viterbo
and
find
sophia
no
he
could
not
do
that
he
had
come
to
italy
to
the
name
of
the
house
of
gobignon
not
besmirch
it
further
what
a
scandal
if
the
king
brother
were
to
charge
that
simon
de
gobignon
turned
his
back
on
him
when
he
was
in
peril
what
would
the
king
and
the
nobles
say
of
him
then
in
france
he
must
see
this
through
at
least
until
charles
was
securely
established
in
rome
but
pray
god
charles
did
not
ask
him
to
stay
with
him
beyond
that
you
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
the
tartars
at
all
charles
said
it
seems
to
me
that
phase
of
things
is
settled
i
think
it
would
be
more
important
for
you
to
go
home
this
summer
to
gobignon
simon
heart
leapt
with
amazement
and
joy
as
the
words
sank
in
yes
yes
i
want
to
very
much
he
blurted
out
i
want
that
more
than
anything
else
i
can
take
sophia
with
charles
came
around
the
table
and
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
simon
shoulder
simon
still
seated
had
to
twist
his
neck
to
look
up
at
him
do
you
remember
when
we
first
spoke
of
your
guarding
the
tartars
i
promised
even
greater
opportunities
for
glory
i
said
that
you
would
ride
in
triumph
through
fallen
cities
yes
said
simon
after
hesitating
a
moment
he
knew
where
charles
was
leading
this
and
felt
a
hollow
of
dread
growing
in
his
stomach
charles
bent
down
bringing
his
face
close
to
simon
his
hand
still
pressing
on
simon
shoulder
the
count
of
anjou
eyes
glowed
green
in
the
candlelight
and
simon
felt
paralyzed
by
his
gaze
as
if
charles
were
a
basilisk
simon
de
gobignon
charles
said
solemnly
i
invite
you
to
join
me
in
the
conquest
of
sicily
and
to
share
with
me
in
the
spoils
i
ask
you
to
bring
the
army
of
gobignon
to
this
war
blood
protect
me
i
can
not
make
my
vassals
come
here
simon
ventured
his
voice
sounded
weak
in
his
ears
charles
face
came
closer
still
them
come
they
will
beg
you
to
them
come
this
will
be
the
greatest
war
since
you
were
a
child
simon
gathered
his
thoughts
their
obligations
to
me
are
limited
many
owe
me
only
thirty
days
service
some
are
not
required
to
serve
outside
gobignon
boundaries
need
only
fight
if
we
are
invaded
your
father
brought
four
hundred
knights
and
two
thousand
with
him
on
the
crusade
my
brother
and
i
led
into
egypt
and
lost
them
but
that
was
a
crusade
and
the
ordinary
obligations
did
not
apply
simon
said
this
will
be
a
crusade
the
pope
is
going
to
declare
manfred
an
infidel
an
enemy
of
the
church
and
proclaim
a
crusade
against
him
but
this
will
not
be
like
crusading
in
outremer
where
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
but
sand
and
palm
trees
and
spiritual
benefits
again
simon
heard
that
hint
of
mockery
in
charles
voice
southern
italy
and
sicily
are
the
wealthiest
lands
in
europe
riches
for
everybody
just
go
back
and
tell
your
seigneurs
and
knights
about
that
they
will
plead
with
you
to
lead
them
hither
he
smiled
sarcastically
i
know
what
a
dedicated
farmer
you
are
so
get
the
harvest
in
and
then
bring
your
army
south
for
the
real
harvest
the
prospect
of
wintering
in
italy
instead
of
in
the
north
should
delight
them
in
all
his
life
simon
thought
he
had
never
wanted
anything
less
than
to
lead
the
knights
and
men
of
gobignon
to
charles
war
he
thought
of
gobignon
so
far
away
in
the
northeast
corner
of
france
what
business
did
his
people
have
in
italy
inevitably
many
gobignon
men
would
die
and
how
would
simon
face
their
families
but
sadly
he
realized
charles
was
right
in
his
prediction
simon
could
think
of
dozens
of
young
barons
and
knights
in
the
gobignon
domain
who
would
ride
singing
to
a
war
waged
for
glory
and
riches
he
chose
his
words
carefully
not
wanting
to
offend
charles
this
question
of
the
crown
of
sicily
it
does
not
touch
gobignon
in
any
way
that
i
can
see
it
would
not
be
right
for
me
to
lead
my
people
to
war
over
it
surprisingly
charles
smiled
i
understand
simon
he
patted
back
he
straightened
up
and
strode
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
sat
again
you
do
see
my
point
uncle
simon
said
nervously
charles
nodded
still
smiling
why
indeed
should
the
count
de
gobignon
come
to
the
aid
of
the
count
i
am
glad
to
see
a
bit
of
shrewdness
in
you
it
means
you
are
growing
up
but
i
will
answer
you
in
one
word
apulia
simon
hunched
forward
apulia
the
southeast
of
italy
the
richest
of
manfred
provinces
where
he
has
always
chosen
to
live
and
his
father
frederic
before
him
simon
count
de
gobignon
duke
of
apulia
how
does
that
sound
in
one
short
war
you
would
double
your
land
holdings
and
triple
your
wealth
now
do
you
see
how
this
war
touches
you
what
simon
realized
with
a
clarity
that
chilled
him
as
if
he
had
suddenly
seen
in
uncle
charles
the
mark
of
some
dread
disease
was
that
he
and
charles
were
utterly
different
kinds
of
men
as
count
of
anjou
and
seigneur
of
arles
charles
already
ruled
a
domain
bigger
than
gobignon
and
he
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
want
more
do
i
not
want
more
should
i
is
something
wrong
with
me
it
was
all
too
much
for
simon
to
think
through
now
while
charles
was
pressing
so
he
had
to
get
away
from
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
agree
now
to
join
forces
with
charles
then
go
back
to
gobignon
and
renege
on
his
promise
charles
would
be
far
too
busy
fighting
in
italy
to
try
to
force
him
to
bring
troops
from
gobignon
no
that
probably
would
not
work
it
would
be
stupid
to
think
he
could
outwit
a
man
as
experienced
in
statecraft
as
the
count
of
anjou
once
simon
promised
charles
would
no
doubt
find
a
way
to
force
him
to
make
good
uncle
charles
i
can
not
decide
in
one
evening
the
future
of
thousands
of
people
whose
lives
and
souls
i
am
responsible
for
charles
shook
his
head
his
face
was
darkening
he
was
getting
angry
you
sound
like
my
brother
talking
about
the
difficulty
of
making
royal
decisions
god
bowels
boy
deciding
what
best
for
our
subjects
is
what
we
were
born
to
do
where
is
the
gobignon
in
you
your
father
count
amalric
for
all
he
went
wrong
at
the
end
of
his
life
would
have
known
how
to
seize
a
moment
like
this
how
do
you
think
that
splendid
domain
you
inherited
was
built
up
empires
must
grow
or
they
wither
and
die
it
is
a
law
of
life
simon
was
never
more
glad
he
was
not
amalric
son
i
must
go
back
and
look
at
the
old
agreements
and
treaties
uncle
charles
i
must
see
what
kind
of
service
each
baron
and
each
knight
owes
me
and
for
how
long
and
under
what
conditions
i
can
call
on
them
let
me
see
what
my
rights
are
as
seigneur
then
i
will
be
able
to
tell
you
how
many
knights
and
men
i
can
bring
to
you
suit
yourself
but
i
will
wager
few
of
them
will
hold
you
to
the
letter
of
their
obligations
as
i
said
when
they
see
the
chances
for
gain
they
will
want
to
come
if
need
be
pay
them
your
treasury
is
fat
you
have
had
no
wars
to
pay
for
for
many
years
whatever
you
spend
you
will
make
back
a
hundredfold
when
we
take
manfred
kingdom
did
not
notice
that
i
did
not
actually
promise
to
bring
any
men
back
with
to
seem
to
promise
and
yet
not
to
promise
simon
felt
rather
proud
of
himself
for
finding
a
way
out
he
felt
like
a
fox
who
had
thrown
a
pack
of
slavering
hounds
off
the
scent
he
had
freed
himself
from
the
trap
anjou
had
built
for
him
perhaps
the
count
was
right
perhaps
this
time
in
italy
done
him
some
good
made
him
a
cleverer
man
he
drank
deeply
of
the
red
roman
wine
and
secretly
toasted
himself
he
would
honor
charles
request
to
remain
at
his
side
in
rome
for
a
time
fighting
for
him
if
need
be
then
to
viterbo
over
a
year
ago
he
had
agreed
to
care
for
the
tartars
and
he
would
be
judged
and
would
judge
himself
on
how
well
he
had
done
that
he
did
not
like
leaving
it
to
de
verceuil
even
if
papa
le
gros
as
the
italians
called
him
were
all
in
favor
of
the
alliance
the
tartars
still
had
many
points
to
settle
before
the
war
the
final
war
on
the
saracens
became
a
reality
before
i
return
to
gobignon
simon
said
i
must
go
to
viterbo
and
make
sure
that
the
tartars
are
well
guarded
suit
yourself
charles
waved
a
large
hand
in
acquiescence
to
viterbo
and
sophia
he
felt
again
the
ecstasy
of
that
day
by
the
lake
the
closeness
the
union
of
their
flesh
how
beautiful
it
had
been
even
here
in
charles
tent
outside
the
walls
of
rome
he
felt
a
hot
stirring
in
his
body
at
the
remembrance
of
their
afternoon
of
love
how
could
she
not
want
that
again
she
must
he
was
sure
of
it
she
wanted
as
he
did
a
lifetime
of
love
that
was
why
she
wept
whenever
he
tried
to
convince
her
that
he
meant
to
marry
her
she
had
promised
him
faithfully
that
the
next
time
they
met
she
would
tell
him
what
the
obstacle
was
to
their
marrying
whatever
the
reason
was
he
would
sweep
it
aside
and
carry
her
off
to
gobignon
with
him
friar
mathieu
could
marry
them
before
they
even
left
viterbo
then
if
grandmère
or
his
sisters
had
any
objections
they
would
have
to
swallow
them
they
could
be
together
in
his
castle
this
summer
when
the
rivers
were
flowing
fast
when
the
trees
were
heavy
with
fruit
and
the
fields
were
green
and
the
forest
was
full
of
fleet
deer
and
clever
foxes
how
she
would
love
it
sophia
a
thousand
visions
of
her
cascaded
through
his
mind
of
her
dark
red
lips
smiling
her
eyes
glowing
like
precious
stones
her
proud
carriage
and
he
remembered
the
feel
of
her
limbs
tangled
with
his
her
passion
the
proof
despite
her
fears
of
the
depth
of
her
love
for
him
it
would
be
maddening
to
stay
away
from
her
for
the
two
months
charles
had
asked
of
him
but
after
that
they
would
have
the
whole
of
their
lives
together
lxii
sophia
heard
a
murmur
from
the
riders
ahead
and
looked
up
it
was
warmer
here
in
the
south
and
she
had
opened
the
curtains
of
her
sedan
chair
following
the
path
around
the
side
of
a
hill
the
two
men
carrying
her
had
brought
lucera
into
view
it
seemed
not
to
have
changed
at
all
in
the
year
and
a
half
since
she
had
left
with
daoud
and
lorenzo
the
octagonal
walls
and
square
towers
of
manfred
citadel
warmed
by
the
setting
sun
rose
above
the
small
city
standing
in
the
center
of
a
plain
surrounded
by
hills
her
skin
tingled
at
the
thought
of
seeing
daoud
again
but
her
heart
which
should
have
been
light
with
happiness
ached
tormented
for
months
by
a
decision
she
could
not
make
a
cry
from
the
leading
the
way
startled
her
her
eyes
followed
a
pointing
arm
and
saw
high
on
the
rocky
slope
of
a
nearby
hill
a
mounted
warrior
he
glittered
in
the
sunset
he
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
see
the
details
of
his
costume
but
gold
flashed
on
his
breastplate
on
his
hands
and
arms
and
on
the
white
turban
that
shaded
his
face
one
of
manfred
saracens
probably
sent
out
from
lucera
to
bid
them
welcome
she
saw
that
their
path
descended
gradually
into
a
valley
the
horse
was
scrambling
down
a
steep
slope
to
meet
them
the
warrior
leaned
back
in
this
saddle
to
balance
himself
riding
easily
down
to
the
valley
floor
as
she
drew
nearer
to
him
her
heart
started
to
hammer
in
her
chest
the
lower
half
of
his
face
was
covered
by
a
short
blond
beard
the
face
was
still
in
shadow
but
the
nose
was
long
and
straight
most
of
all
it
was
his
carriage
that
told
her
who
he
was
he
held
himself
so
perfectly
erect
that
he
almost
seemed
made
of
some
substance
lighter
and
finer
than
ordinary
flesh
and
yet
there
was
not
a
trace
of
stiffness
in
his
posture
like
a
young
tree
some
vessel
seemed
to
open
within
her
and
spread
a
gentle
joyous
balm
throughout
her
body
ahead
of
her
ugolini
alerted
by
his
guards
had
thrown
back
the
curtains
of
his
sedan
chair
and
was
leaning
out
he
was
bareheaded
his
white
fluttering
in
the
breeze
he
must
be
beside
himself
with
excitement
sophia
thought
at
the
prospect
of
reunion
with
tilia
the
horseman
touched
his
right
hand
to
his
white
turban
in
salute
to
ugolini
and
rode
on
past
how
splendidly
he
was
caparisoned
from
the
white
plume
in
his
turban
to
his
jeweled
carved
stirrups
the
breastplate
over
his
long
red
riding
robe
was
of
polished
steel
inlaid
with
gold
in
arabic
spirals
jewels
sparkled
on
the
hilt
and
sheath
of
his
sword
he
was
close
enough
for
her
to
see
his
face
clearly
his
new
beard
gave
him
a
commanding
princely
look
seeing
him
like
this
she
understood
better
what
the
word
meant
she
felt
as
if
a
new
sun
had
arisen
before
her
how
unbelievably
lucky
she
was
to
be
loved
by
such
a
man
but
like
an
enemy
in
ambush
the
pain
of
her
indecision
struck
her
in
the
heart
more
fool
i
am
to
have
betrayed
he
drew
up
beside
her
and
rode
around
her
sedan
chair
so
that
the
head
of
his
glistening
black
horse
was
toward
lucera
in
a
sudden
movement
he
leaned
down
from
the
saddle
an
irresistible
arm
encircled
her
waist
and
pulled
her
up
out
of
the
sedan
chair
for
a
moment
she
felt
alarmed
and
amazed
as
if
she
were
flying
through
the
air
then
before
she
could
scream
she
found
herself
comfortably
seated
across
the
great
horse
her
shoulder
resting
on
his
breastplate
his
arms
around
her
her
only
fear
was
that
she
might
faint
at
his
touch
and
like
that
they
rode
into
lucera
together
for
all
the
world
to
see
what
exquisite
irony
she
gazed
around
the
bedchamber
daoud
had
led
her
to
hardly
able
to
believe
her
eyes
the
big
bed
with
its
golden
curtains
was
the
same
and
so
was
the
window
with
its
pointed
arch
this
was
the
very
room
the
very
bed
in
which
manfred
and
she
had
made
love
for
the
last
time
manfred
must
have
deliberately
chosen
to
give
this
room
to
them
daoud
weapons
hung
on
the
wall
and
his
armor
was
mounted
on
wooden
stands
chests
of
clothing
and
other
possessions
were
lined
up
along
the
wall
soon
the
servants
would
be
bringing
her
things
in
too
this
room
another
thing
she
could
not
tell
him
about
she
despised
herself
but
it
might
well
offend
him
if
he
knew
of
manfred
little
joke
and
enmity
between
daoud
and
manfred
at
this
moment
could
be
disastrous
needs
daoud
why
is
he
so
foolish
as
to
risk
angering
him
daoud
and
she
stood
staring
at
each
other
they
had
said
little
so
far
she
felt
overwhelmed
and
she
supposed
he
did
too
she
felt
her
longing
for
him
as
a
strange
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
he
took
her
shoulders
in
his
hands
how
good
to
feel
his
strong
fingers
holding
her
how
long
has
this
been
your
room
she
asked
for
about
a
month
rather
grand
is
it
not
the
king
says
it
is
suitable
to
my
rank
i
have
my
own
command
a
division
of
his
mounted
muslim
warriors
i
call
them
the
sons
of
the
falcon
to
my
she
wondered
how
much
daoud
knew
about
herself
and
manfred
what
troubles
you
he
asked
many
manfred
she
said
choosing
the
worry
easiest
to
speak
of
he
stroked
her
cheek
gently
no
need
to
torment
yourself
i
understand
how
it
must
have
been
would
you
understand
about
simon
she
said
but
can
manfred
accept
what
you
and
i
are
to
each
other
he
shrugged
you
see
that
we
are
together
in
his
palace
you
saw
that
i
rode
with
you
before
me
on
my
horse
through
the
streets
of
lucera
and
into
manfred
castle
i
see
that
manfred
must
know
about
us
are
you
sure
he
does
not
want
me
back
it
can
be
fatal
to
cross
a
king
when
we
got
the
message
that
ugolini
and
you
were
coming
here
instead
of
going
to
viterbo
i
talked
with
manfred
not
as
subject
and
king
but
as
man
and
man
he
was
most
gracious
as
manfred
usually
is
what
did
he
tell
you
that
indeed
he
still
cares
for
you
too
much
it
seems
too
much
daoud
teeth
flashed
in
his
blond
beard
his
queen
the
mother
of
his
four
children
helene
of
cyprus
usually
looks
the
other
way
when
manfred
beds
beautiful
young
women
but
she
saw
in
you
too
serious
a
rival
he
had
to
send
you
off
with
me
or
the
queen
would
have
had
you
poisoned
sophia
eyes
strayed
to
the
bed
in
horror
she
remembered
now
that
before
she
left
here
manfred
had
hinted
at
something
like
that
poisoned
and
i
am
safe
now
again
the
white
grin
in
the
blond
beard
during
the
six
months
they
had
been
apart
she
had
begun
to
think
that
her
love
for
him
might
have
seduced
memory
and
enhanced
his
good
looks
beyond
reality
but
now
in
the
flesh
he
surpassed
even
the
image
her
memory
had
cherished
you
are
safe
as
long
as
you
stay
away
from
manfred
and
he
from
you
there
will
be
a
feast
tonight
in
honor
of
cardinal
ugolini
you
will
see
how
carefully
the
king
will
avoid
you
daoud
pulled
her
close
to
enfold
her
in
his
arms
he
had
taken
off
his
surcoat
and
breastplate
and
with
her
head
against
his
chest
she
could
feel
his
heart
beating
strong
and
fast
under
his
silk
robe
and
you
she
said
do
you
hate
the
thought
that
manfred
and
i
were
lovers
that
very
it
is
far
in
the
past
daoud
said
before
you
met
me
he
held
her
away
from
him
and
looked
at
her
with
laughter
in
his
blue
eyes
even
the
prophet
married
a
widow
his
gentle
acceptance
his
easy
assumption
that
all
was
over
between
herself
and
manfred
tore
at
her
heart
if
she
even
mentioned
simon
it
would
be
different
that
was
not
in
the
past
that
was
after
she
had
met
daoud
after
they
became
lovers
for
the
time
she
cursed
herself
for
letting
it
happen
i
am
a
whore
as
bad
as
the
worst
painted
prostitute
plying
her
trade
under
the
arches
by
the
no
worse
than
that
in
a
way
a
prostitute
had
a
clear
reason
for
doing
what
she
did
with
men
the
more
sophia
thought
about
the
time
she
let
simon
possess
her
the
less
she
understood
it
and
even
a
prostitute
knew
her
occupation
and
her
place
in
the
world
from
the
night
that
alexis
cast
her
adrift
sophia
had
in
a
way
been
lost
but
there
came
to
her
a
glimmering
of
hope
daoud
had
a
place
here
with
manfred
and
she
had
a
place
beside
daoud
could
it
be
that
at
last
she
had
a
home
then
she
should
do
nothing
to
endanger
it
she
should
say
nothing
about
simon
come
to
bed
he
whispered
still
holding
her
and
taking
a
step
in
that
direction
the
feel
of
his
arms
around
her
and
his
body
pressing
against
her
sent
ripples
of
need
for
him
through
her
but
now
with
thoughts
of
manfred
and
much
worse
of
simon
confusing
her
she
felt
frightened
unready
she
needed
more
time
i
have
had
no
proper
bath
in
days
daoud
i
feel
the
grime
of
the
road
all
over
me
of
course
he
smiled
and
now
you
can
have
a
proper
bath
let
me
see
to
it
in
the
year
and
a
half
since
she
left
this
place
sophia
had
all
but
forgotten
the
bathing
rooms
in
the
lowest
level
of
castello
lucera
she
had
not
used
them
as
much
as
she
had
wished
to
when
she
lived
here
before
in
her
strange
position
as
a
foreigner
and
one
of
loves
she
had
not
felt
comfortable
bathing
with
the
other
women
who
lived
in
the
castle
but
tonight
as
she
and
daoud
undressed
in
the
anteroom
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
daoud
must
stand
high
indeed
with
manfred
to
have
arranged
that
she
thought
in
the
light
of
the
oil
lamp
hanging
overhead
his
naked
body
was
a
golden
color
and
free
as
far
as
she
could
tell
from
the
marks
of
insult
the
podesta
torturer
had
inflicted
upon
it
last
summer
she
was
not
naked
she
wore
a
linen
gown
that
opened
down
the
front
her
continued
worrying
over
whether
or
not
to
tell
him
about
simon
made
her
want
to
stay
covered
as
long
as
she
could
but
with
a
smile
he
pulled
her
gown
apart
and
slipped
it
off
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
to
the
floor
a
glance
down
his
body
told
her
that
he
wanted
her
now
the
sight
thrilled
her
but
she
still
felt
uneasy
and
not
able
to
give
herself
wholeheartedly
to
him
and
to
the
act
of
love
let
us
attend
to
the
grime
she
said
with
a
small
smile
in
the
next
room
its
walls
tiled
in
white
she
lay
in
a
round
sunken
tub
filled
with
hot
water
piped
in
from
the
castle
kitchen
it
was
large
enough
for
daoud
to
stand
over
her
in
it
he
took
over
the
task
of
washing
her
with
scented
soap
imported
from
spain
at
first
she
simply
lay
back
and
enjoyed
her
renewed
acquaintance
with
the
amenities
of
manfred
kingdom
so
much
more
like
constantinople
than
life
in
the
papal
states
had
been
but
as
the
hot
water
relaxed
her
and
as
daoud
hands
slippery
with
soap
slid
over
her
skin
she
felt
the
rising
warmth
of
desire
nothing
mattered
but
this
moment
she
wriggled
her
legs
and
hips
against
him
in
small
almost
unwilled
movements
the
grime
first
he
said
with
a
soft
laugh
and
continued
methodically
to
soap
her
until
she
was
mad
with
wanting
him
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
into
the
next
room
its
tiles
the
of
sunset
which
was
taken
up
by
a
great
pool
of
very
hot
water
usually
this
chamber
would
be
occupied
by
anywhere
from
six
to
a
dozen
men
or
women
but
tonight
sophia
and
daoud
were
quite
alone
still
carrying
her
he
descended
the
steps
into
the
hot
pool
ribbons
of
steam
rose
around
them
he
lowered
her
into
the
water
when
she
stood
in
it
the
heat
was
almost
unbearable
as
if
she
were
about
to
be
boiled
to
death
but
then
the
heat
soaked
into
her
until
her
very
bones
felt
liquefied
her
whole
being
melted
until
she
was
not
a
person
who
felt
desire
she
desire
itself
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
she
pulled
his
head
down
and
kissed
him
flicks
of
her
tongue
tip
luring
his
tongue
into
her
mouth
he
pressed
her
back
against
the
warm
tile
wall
and
she
knotted
her
legs
around
his
waist
as
he
took
her
standing
up
moments
later
her
ecstatic
cries
were
echoing
through
the
bathing
rooms
they
forgot
about
time
her
voice
rang
again
and
again
in
the
vaulted
chamber
they
made
love
in
the
hot
water
and
then
lying
on
linen
cloths
on
the
masseur
slab
beside
the
pool
they
nearly
fell
asleep
in
each
other
arms
laughing
at
their
bodies
foolishness
they
plunged
into
the
last
pool
cold
water
in
a
room
then
hurried
through
a
door
to
the
place
where
they
had
started
and
dressed
again
when
they
were
back
in
their
room
daoud
voice
was
drowsy
as
he
lay
beside
her
on
the
bed
you
must
have
bypassed
rome
when
you
came
down
with
the
count
of
anjou
and
simon
de
gobignon
both
there
he
said
at
the
mention
of
simon
name
sophia
pleasant
sleepiness
fled
and
she
felt
an
ache
in
the
pit
of
her
stomach
should
she
tell
daoud
or
not
she
still
could
not
decide
the
uncertainty
itself
had
become
almost
as
great
an
agony
as
the
fear
of
what
would
happen
if
she
told
him
she
rolled
over
with
her
back
to
him
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
yes
she
said
we
went
east
into
the
abruzzi
and
through
and
sulmona
terribly
mountainous
country
it
took
us
much
longer
but
it
was
safer
if
i
do
not
tell
him
every
time
he
takes
me
in
his
arms
i
will
know
that
i
am
lying
to
him
i
will
always
be
aware
that
i
am
keeping
something
back
from
him
that
he
would
want
to
know
i
betrayed
him
with
simon
and
each
time
i
have
the
chance
to
tell
him
and
do
not
i
am
betraying
him
before
charles
took
rome
lorenzo
and
tilia
and
i
passed
near
the
city
but
skirted
around
it
it
would
not
do
to
have
someone
from
that
inn
recognize
us
how
well
i
remember
that
night
it
was
then
that
she
had
first
seen
how
resourceful
and
how
ruthless
daoud
could
be
lorenzo
and
i
could
talk
about
it
now
without
getting
angry
daoud
said
he
told
me
he
tried
to
help
the
old
jew
rachel
husband
because
a
man
does
not
forget
the
faith
and
the
people
he
was
born
to
and
you
wondered
about
yourself
said
sophia
exactly
the
palm
of
his
hand
felt
wonderfully
hard
against
the
flesh
of
her
buttocks
and
strangely
i
found
myself
thinking
of
simon
de
gobignon
she
felt
her
body
stiffen
and
tried
to
make
herself
relax
what
could
have
made
you
think
of
him
she
had
never
told
daoud
about
shadowed
childhood
she
wondered
if
he
had
heard
of
it
from
someone
else
i
asked
myself
what
if
the
turks
had
not
overrun
ascalon
and
killed
my
parents
and
carried
me
off
and
the
answer
came
that
i
would
have
been
very
like
simon
de
gobignon
he
grew
up
you
see
having
all
the
things
i
lost
what
things
a
family
a
home
the
christian
faith
freedom
knighthood
his
country
even
his
name
this
talk
about
simon
was
making
her
desperately
uneasy
she
wondered
if
she
could
tell
daoud
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
all
and
i
saw
at
last
why
i
hated
him
so
much
daoud
went
on
i
hated
him
in
part
of
course
because
of
you
i
had
already
started
to
love
you
and
the
thought
of
him
possessing
you
made
me
furious
and
yet
it
was
my
duty
to
send
you
to
bed
with
him
fortunately
that
never
had
to
happen
but
there
was
an
even
deeper
reason
for
my
hating
him
what
was
that
she
asked
envy
envy
that
i
could
not
admit
to
myself
not
admit
to
yourself
why
his
hand
on
her
was
motionless
she
sensed
that
it
was
an
effort
for
him
to
put
his
thought
into
words
because
i
was
afraid
to
that
is
always
why
we
do
not
admit
a
truth
to
ourselves
my
sufi
sheikh
often
said
things
you
most
fear
those
you
must
turn
and
stare
at
until
you
are
no
longer
i
was
afraid
i
might
betray
my
faith
you
mean
renounce
islam
a
chill
went
through
her
what
a
disaster
for
all
of
them
that
could
have
been
she
could
well
understand
how
the
thought
of
that
might
frighten
him
yes
i
had
to
put
that
possibility
out
of
my
mind
so
i
hated
simon
de
gobignon
without
knowing
why
because
i
did
not
understand
my
hatred
i
hated
him
all
the
more
only
we
could
stop
talking
about
but
the
man
she
loved
was
telling
her
something
very
important
about
himself
she
had
to
set
her
own
discomfort
aside
she
had
to
listen
and
now
you
do
not
hate
him
she
turned
over
in
the
bed
she
wanted
to
see
his
face
there
was
a
peacefulness
in
his
eyes
such
as
she
had
never
seen
before
always
they
had
seemed
to
burn
now
they
were
clear
and
fathomless
like
the
sky
i
do
not
hate
him
i
realized
as
i
rode
along
with
lorenzo
that
if
your
new
faith
is
strong
and
your
new
people
are
good
you
can
remember
without
danger
what
you
loved
of
the
old
i
will
always
love
the
sound
of
the
christian
priests
chanting
in
the
cool
dark
of
a
church
i
will
always
feel
especially
at
home
in
a
christian
castle
but
the
voice
i
hear
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
today
is
the
true
voice
of
god
and
that
simon
de
gobignon
will
never
hear
unless
god
hand
reaches
out
for
him
as
it
did
for
me
awed
sophia
said
i
have
never
heard
anyone
speak
as
you
do
with
so
much
wisdom
except
once
or
twice
a
priest
he
closed
his
eyes
i
speak
as
i
am
inspired
to
speak
in
islam
there
are
no
priests
that
stand
between
god
and
man
there
are
the
more
learned
and
the
less
learned
but
each
man
and
each
woman
can
hear
god
daoud
had
bared
his
soul
to
her
she
wanted
to
do
the
same
love
was
not
merely
the
coupling
of
naked
bodies
but
the
union
of
naked
minds
how
could
she
ever
be
happy
with
him
while
lying
to
him
but
she
did
not
love
simon
what
had
happened
between
them
had
been
a
moment
of
being
overwhelmed
by
feeling
it
had
been
done
not
by
her
but
by
sophia
orfali
she
had
felt
sorry
for
simon
and
wanted
to
comfort
him
she
had
been
moved
by
the
purity
of
his
love
for
her
and
her
body
which
had
not
known
daoud
for
months
ran
away
with
her
it
was
a
shameful
thing
but
not
an
important
thing
because
it
did
not
change
her
love
for
daoud
it
would
be
important
to
daoud
though
he
would
feel
that
she
had
betrayed
him
he
would
want
revenge
he
would
hate
simon
most
important
the
peace
with
his
own
childhood
reached
after
painful
struggle
might
be
destroyed
the
beautiful
state
of
mind
he
had
shown
her
might
be
lost
for
the
sake
of
his
peace
she
must
keep
silent
she
hated
the
decision
it
meant
that
a
part
of
her
would
always
be
locked
away
from
daoud
and
he
would
never
know
it
very
well
then
let
and
not
his
wrath
at
the
revelation
be
her
punishment
for
having
let
herself
go
that
day
with
simon
by
the
lake
that
would
be
the
mutilation
she
would
always
bear
perfect
union
with
daoud
would
be
a
promised
land
she
would
never
enter
by
suffering
that
she
would
silently
make
restitution
to
daoud
for
the
wrong
she
had
done
him
all
the
while
she
had
been
thinking
he
had
been
gazing
at
her
just
as
she
reached
her
final
decision
his
eyes
closed
and
his
breathing
deepened
she
reached
out
and
touched
the
sparse
blond
hairs
in
the
center
of
his
chest
lightly
so
as
not
to
wake
him
lost
everything
too
he
and
i
are
so
mother
and
father
alexis
whom
she
had
loved
in
the
simple
way
that
simon
loved
her
all
lost
in
one
night
of
fire
and
steel
and
after
that
the
life
she
led
had
been
so
little
like
that
of
other
women
a
life
so
strange
and
venturesome
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
herself
and
yet
a
life
she
had
loved
much
of
the
time
if
simon
reminded
daoud
of
what
he
had
lost
almost
any
woman
she
met
did
the
same
for
sophia
why
she
wondered
had
a
man
seed
never
quickened
within
her
she
was
years
old
and
she
had
never
been
with
child
not
once
since
girlhood
had
her
monthly
flow
of
blood
failed
am
she
thought
sadly
as
she
had
countless
times
before
and
just
as
well
even
one
baby
would
have
been
an
impossible
burden
in
the
years
since
she
fled
to
michael
but
now
if
daoud
were
to
get
her
with
child
what
joy
that
would
be
at
this
moment
it
seemed
she
had
nothing
to
do
except
be
a
companion
to
daoud
there
had
never
been
a
better
time
in
her
life
for
having
a
child
and
even
if
she
could
never
be
wholly
one
with
daoud
she
could
be
one
with
their
child
there
were
remedies
for
barrenness
she
thought
and
sometimes
they
worked
wise
old
women
knew
them
she
might
seek
out
such
a
woman
tilia
must
know
a
great
deal
about
preventing
conception
perhaps
she
knew
something
about
how
to
make
it
happen
there
would
be
no
more
work
of
the
sort
she
had
done
for
michael
and
then
for
manfred
she
was
known
in
the
north
she
could
not
go
back
there
and
once
manfred
defeated
the
french
and
drove
them
out
of
italy
he
would
want
to
help
him
govern
a
woman
had
no
place
in
governing
unless
she
were
married
to
a
man
of
power
or
had
inherited
a
title
of
her
own
a
child
after
all
this
was
over
might
be
all
she
would
have
left
daoud
could
be
killed
fighting
the
french
her
heart
stopped
beating
for
a
moment
and
then
began
pounding
in
fear
she
put
that
thought
out
of
her
mind
quickly
she
must
believe
that
he
would
not
be
killed
and
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
so
with
all
he
had
survived
already
no
it
was
more
likely
she
would
lose
him
when
the
war
was
over
and
he
went
back
to
his
people
he
loved
his
faith
loved
the
land
that
had
first
enslaved
him
then
made
him
a
warrior
and
she
could
never
go
back
to
cairo
with
him
what
she
had
heard
about
a
woman
lot
among
the
muslims
sounded
like
a
living
death
he
had
never
said
so
but
he
probably
had
a
wife
in
egypt
several
wives
perhaps
as
muslims
were
said
to
do
live
as
just
of
his
wives
her
stomach
burned
at
the
idea
unthinkable
could
she
persuade
daoud
to
come
with
her
to
constantinople
daoud
could
serve
the
basileus
brilliantly
as
a
strategos
a
general
or
as
a
mediator
between
byzantines
and
saracens
a
man
of
his
experience
would
be
invaluable
ah
but
to
achieve
to
the
utmost
of
his
ability
though
daoud
would
have
to
join
the
orthodox
church
and
that
after
the
words
he
had
just
spoken
she
could
never
imagine
him
doing
well
but
she
imagine
it
why
spoil
the
beautiful
dream
of
herself
and
daoud
together
amid
the
glories
of
the
polis
for
the
moment
she
could
indulge
her
fancy
and
tell
herself
anything
was
possible
allowing
her
mind
to
drift
among
these
visions
she
fell
asleep
lxiii
ecco
the
residence
of
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
said
sordello
with
a
flourish
of
his
hand
the
narrow
viterbo
street
on
which
simon
sordello
and
thierry
had
been
riding
opened
out
suddenly
and
they
were
facing
a
huge
cylinder
built
of
small
stones
blackened
with
age
simon
felt
his
mouth
fall
open
in
wonder
and
he
quickly
snapped
it
shut
he
would
not
let
anything
de
verceuil
might
do
seem
to
impress
him
they
rode
across
a
drawbridge
over
a
moat
full
of
water
that
smelled
of
rotting
things
its
surface
coated
with
a
green
slime
it
looks
a
bit
like
castel
sant
angelo
in
rome
simon
remarked
it
was
a
pagan
temple
in
ancient
times
said
sordello
after
passing
through
the
gatehouse
they
found
themselves
in
a
semicircular
courtyard
the
palace
was
built
against
the
rear
half
of
the
old
roman
inner
wall
and
towered
above
it
no
more
lodging
with
some
noble
family
or
other
said
sordello
proudly
now
our
party
has
a
residence
of
its
own
would
rather
have
almost
anyone
but
de
verceuil
as
my
simon
hoped
he
need
stay
here
for
only
a
short
time
just
long
enough
to
find
sophia
overcome
her
reservations
about
marrying
him
and
be
off
to
gobignon
his
heart
beat
harder
as
he
thought
of
seeing
her
again
after
those
lonely
miserable
months
in
rome
thierry
took
their
horses
to
be
stabled
while
sordello
ushered
simon
through
a
cavernous
hall
lit
by
a
few
small
windows
near
the
ceiling
two
simon
recognized
as
part
of
his
troop
of
venetian
crossbowmen
snapped
to
attention
just
inside
the
door
and
after
a
frantic
scramble
through
his
memory
simon
managed
to
greet
them
by
name
to
sordello
simon
said
i
thank
you
for
meeting
thierry
and
me
at
the
city
gate
and
guiding
us
here
they
crossed
the
entrance
hall
after
a
long
ride
one
does
not
want
to
have
to
find
one
way
around
a
strange
city
sordello
smiled
smugly
in
acknowledgment
little
enough
for
me
to
do
your
signory
for
one
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
come
i
show
you
to
the
room
his
eminence
has
set
aside
for
you
he
led
simon
up
a
great
flight
of
marble
stairs
from
ground
level
to
the
first
floor
of
the
mansion
i
am
capitano
of
the
crossbow
troop
again
sordello
said
suddenly
halfway
up
the
stairs
who
decided
that
said
simon
irritably
i
appointed
peppino
capitano
after
teodoro
was
killed
sordello
bloodshot
eyes
caught
simon
peppino
was
most
courteous
about
yielding
to
me
when
i
rejoined
the
tartar
ambassadors
guards
after
all
i
am
senior
to
him
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
marble
stairs
and
he
held
out
a
hand
to
indicate
stone
steps
leading
to
the
second
floor
simon
had
removed
sordello
from
his
position
for
nearly
killing
the
armenian
prince
and
it
was
pure
insubordination
for
the
fellow
to
bully
his
way
back
into
it
in
simon
absence
and
without
his
consent
it
was
typical
of
sordello
infuriating
combination
of
guile
and
gall
simon
reproached
himself
for
not
leaving
clear
orders
on
who
was
to
lead
the
crossbow
troop
when
he
left
sordello
with
them
and
was
off
to
join
count
charles
in
rome
but
his
head
and
heart
had
been
full
of
sophia
then
discipline
demanded
that
he
depose
sordello
and
reinstate
peppino
yes
he
thought
if
he
were
intending
to
stay
here
he
would
do
exactly
that
but
if
he
did
it
and
then
left
again
it
would
probably
only
provoke
a
duel
to
the
death
between
peppino
and
sordello
let
things
be
a
few
weeks
from
now
at
most
he
could
forget
the
whole
damned
lot
of
them
tartars
and
all
but
sordello
reemergence
as
leader
of
the
crossbowmen
raised
another
question
would
it
offend
the
armenians
they
came
now
to
wooden
steps
leading
into
the
shadowy
upper
reaches
of
de
verceuil
castle
simon
looked
dubiously
at
them
trust
me
your
signory
as
in
any
palace
the
best
apartments
are
on
the
top
floor
you
when
god
invites
lucifer
to
move
back
into
and
it
was
equally
unlikely
that
de
verceuil
would
provide
anything
truly
grand
for
simon
he
shrugged
and
let
sordello
climb
the
wooden
steps
ahead
of
him
what
about
the
armenian
prince
hethum
does
he
still
want
your
blood
sordello
laughed
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
all
settled
your
signory
i
know
viterbo
as
i
know
most
of
these
umbrian
hill
towns
and
i
entertained
all
the
armenians
for
a
night
and
a
day
at
my
expense
the
best
taverns
the
best
whorehouses
hethum
and
i
are
friends
now
one
did
not
entertain
so
lavishly
on
the
fifteen
florins
a
month
sordello
would
receive
as
capitano
of
the
archers
doubtless
he
had
found
other
ways
to
line
his
pockets
the
mention
of
whorehouses
reminded
simon
of
the
plight
of
the
girl
rachel
he
must
find
out
if
friar
mathieu
had
done
anything
to
help
her
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
cardinal
palace
sordello
led
simon
through
five
connected
rooms
two
of
them
were
bare
of
furniture
but
simon
saw
rumpled
beds
and
traveling
chests
in
the
other
three
in
the
last
one
a
priest
sat
at
a
desk
by
a
window
writing
he
frowned
at
simon
and
sordello
as
if
to
reprove
them
for
disturbing
him
these
are
the
good
apartments
simon
said
when
sordello
ushered
him
into
a
bare
chamber
with
a
small
bed
in
one
corner
and
a
smaller
trundle
bed
beside
it
the
window
was
large
but
covered
by
wooden
shutters
simon
pushed
them
open
to
let
in
more
light
sordello
shrugged
this
is
truly
the
best
available
your
signory
the
cardinal
has
many
people
in
his
employ
and
many
guests
i
would
not
leave
those
shutters
open
too
long
if
i
were
you
even
though
it
is
only
april
the
flies
and
mosquitos
are
numerous
already
a
wet
winter
always
brings
them
out
worth
the
trouble
to
complain
about
the
room
i
wo
be
here
that
tell
friar
mathieu
i
am
here
sordello
and
tell
thierry
to
have
a
hot
bath
sent
up
to
me
yes
your
signory
but
unless
you
are
willing
to
wait
till
midnight
i
suggest
you
go
down
to
the
kitchen
for
your
bath
the
servants
are
obedient
to
him
and
care
not
a
fig
for
anyone
else
and
your
equerry
will
find
none
willing
to
carry
a
tub
of
hot
water
up
four
flights
of
stairs
this
was
too
much
now
damn
your
lazy
buttocks
sordello
i
am
paying
you
out
of
my
own
purse
and
you
have
had
no
work
to
do
since
i
left
you
in
perugia
you
see
that
a
hot
bath
reaches
me
by
vespers
or
forget
you
were
ever
in
my
service
sordello
cheeks
flushed
but
he
bowed
and
left
simon
leaned
on
the
sill
of
his
window
looking
out
over
the
tiled
rooftops
of
viterbo
all
the
buildings
he
could
see
were
built
of
a
dark
gray
stone
giving
the
place
an
ancient
look
even
though
for
all
he
knew
many
houses
might
be
quite
recently
built
this
palace
cardinal
de
verceuil
had
bought
for
himself
seemed
to
occupy
one
of
the
highest
points
just
as
perugia
had
been
bigger
than
orvieto
so
viterbo
was
bigger
than
perugia
guards
in
the
black
and
gold
of
the
local
militia
paced
the
high
city
wall
from
one
massive
tower
to
another
about
twenty
years
ago
this
city
had
withstood
a
siege
by
king
manfred
father
emperor
frederic
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
simon
had
heard
that
cardinal
le
gros
now
pope
clement
had
chosen
it
he
heard
a
rhythmic
thumping
behind
him
then
a
knock
at
his
door
he
opened
it
to
see
friar
mathieu
bent
and
thinner
his
white
beard
leaning
on
a
walking
stick
they
hugged
each
other
simon
holding
the
old
franciscan
gingerly
the
safest
place
on
this
floor
to
talk
is
the
loggia
said
friar
mathieu
we
can
share
our
news
there
he
bowed
to
the
priest
in
the
next
room
and
greeted
him
by
name
and
was
answered
with
a
grunt
one
of
de
verceuil
large
staff
said
friar
mathieu
when
they
were
out
of
the
priest
chamber
it
is
no
accident
that
his
room
is
next
to
yours
i
am
surprised
de
verceuil
lets
you
live
here
father
his
eminence
would
rather
have
me
far
away
but
pope
clement
insists
i
stay
close
to
the
tartars
and
there
was
a
letter
from
king
louis
saying
the
same
after
all
people
who
speak
the
tartars
language
are
scarce
this
side
of
the
danube
and
his
eminence
may
dislike
me
but
the
king
and
the
pope
both
trust
me
more
perhaps
than
they
trust
him
so
the
cardinal
put
me
in
a
cubbyhole
near
john
and
philip
where
i
am
quite
content
they
came
to
the
stairs
where
a
doorway
led
out
to
the
loggia
the
floor
was
of
red
tile
and
the
walls
and
columns
painted
a
pale
green
benches
and
potted
trees
just
beginning
to
bud
were
set
along
the
loggia
they
were
facing
west
overlooking
the
courtyard
they
sat
on
a
bench
their
faces
shaded
by
the
overhanging
roof
their
knees
and
feet
in
the
sunlight
simon
enjoyed
the
late
afternoon
warmth
on
his
legs
tired
from
a
week
riding
he
looked
forward
to
his
bath
i
am
sure
pope
clement
himself
will
be
eager
to
see
you
said
friar
mathieu
i
hear
he
has
been
deluging
count
charles
with
letters
demanding
to
know
when
he
will
march
against
manfred
count
charles
does
not
have
a
big
enough
army
yet
to
attack
manfred
said
simon
thinking
how
glad
he
was
to
be
away
from
the
dour
driven
count
and
it
seems
that
manfred
would
rather
wait
for
him
to
make
the
first
move
anjou
says
he
will
not
be
able
to
recruit
more
knights
and
men
until
the
pope
officially
gives
him
the
crown
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
his
holiness
wants
charles
to
come
to
viterbo
to
be
crowned
he
refuses
to
set
foot
in
rome
charles
is
determined
to
be
crowned
by
the
pope
in
rome
he
keeps
mentioning
that
charlemagne
was
crowned
in
rome
friar
mathieu
smiled
so
the
fate
of
italy
is
in
the
hands
of
three
men
who
are
each
unwilling
to
make
a
move
sunlight
turned
his
beard
to
silver
and
what
are
your
plans
have
you
returned
to
us
for
good
or
will
you
go
back
to
count
charles
at
the
thought
of
the
prospect
before
him
simon
felt
a
warmth
within
rivaling
the
afternoon
sun
tell
me
father
where
can
i
find
cardinal
ugolini
niece
sophia
friar
mathieu
eyes
seemed
to
sink
deeper
into
the
hollows
under
his
white
brows
ugolini
and
sophia
are
not
here
in
viterbo
simon
felt
as
if
a
wintry
chill
had
fallen
on
the
loggia
what
where
have
they
gone
they
never
came
here
none
of
us
not
even
the
pope
realized
ugolini
was
gone
until
the
day
of
the
papal
coronation
when
he
still
had
not
appeared
it
was
a
scandal
after
all
ugolini
was
cardinal
camerlengo
under
urban
papa
le
gros
clement
was
furious
the
rumor
is
that
ugolini
has
fled
to
manfred
the
pope
intends
to
strip
him
of
his
rank
for
leaving
the
papal
states
without
permission
the
pain
of
loss
made
simon
cry
out
but
sophia
what
of
sophia
friar
mathieu
shook
his
head
sadly
she
must
be
with
ugolini
they
are
probably
both
in
manfred
kingdom
simon
fell
back
against
the
plaster
wall
gasping
but
a
message
there
must
have
been
a
message
for
me
she
must
have
left
some
word
with
whom
friar
mathieu
spread
his
hands
she
knows
i
am
your
friend
but
i
heard
nothing
from
her
in
all
the
time
since
he
left
perugia
simon
vision
of
sophia
his
dreams
of
their
life
together
had
sustained
him
he
thought
constantly
of
her
during
those
dreary
weeks
while
count
charles
was
parading
around
rome
giving
orders
to
sullen
italians
exercising
his
troops
arguing
with
his
captains
and
hanging
those
who
made
difficulties
on
a
loggia
much
like
this
one
at
ugolini
perugia
mansion
sophia
had
made
the
promise
that
had
given
him
hope
all
he
needed
he
was
sure
was
to
know
what
stood
between
them
and
he
would
be
able
to
overcome
it
and
now
as
suddenly
as
if
sophia
had
been
on
a
ship
and
a
wave
had
swept
her
overboard
she
was
gone
he
felt
himself
getting
angry
at
friar
mathieu
he
could
not
believe
what
the
old
priest
was
telling
him
she
promised
me
he
blurted
out
promised
you
what
said
friar
mathieu
softly
that
she
would
tell
me
why
she
could
not
marry
me
there
was
a
long
silence
while
simon
stared
at
the
rooftops
of
viterbo
silhouetted
against
a
golden
sky
you
wanted
to
marry
her
friar
mathieu
asked
in
a
soft
voice
i
to
marry
her
said
simon
his
voice
sullen
after
another
long
pause
he
added
i
was
hoping
you
would
marry
us
simon
said
friar
mathieu
quietly
how
much
do
you
really
know
about
sophia
simon
thought
he
heard
pity
in
the
old
man
voice
he
felt
a
twinge
of
fear
and
inched
away
from
the
franciscan
almost
against
his
will
his
head
turned
toward
friar
mathieu
he
felt
himself
forced
to
repeat
the
little
that
sophia
had
told
him
about
herself
since
they
met
the
thought
of
that
afternoon
by
the
lake
came
to
him
stabbing
him
like
a
spear
he
would
not
tell
friar
mathieu
about
that
not
yet
this
was
not
confession
friar
mathieu
did
not
meet
simon
intent
gaze
but
looked
downward
and
simon
saw
deep
shadowed
pouches
under
his
eyes
simon
you
recall
the
girl
rachel
of
her
simon
wondered
annoyed
at
the
change
of
subject
then
he
remembered
it
was
sophia
who
asked
me
to
speak
to
you
about
rachel
just
so
i
had
already
tried
everything
including
prayer
to
get
john
chagan
to
free
rachel
but
i
could
not
move
his
heart
he
prizes
her
almost
to
the
point
of
madness
but
i
did
continue
my
efforts
because
you
asked
me
to
i
begged
appealed
to
his
better
nature
he
does
have
one
and
threatened
the
fires
of
hell
nothing
worked
for
a
time
when
we
learned
that
hulagu
khan
had
died
we
thought
that
john
and
philip
would
have
to
go
back
to
persia
john
even
spoke
of
taking
rachel
with
him
and
making
her
his
chief
wife
do
you
have
any
idea
what
an
honor
that
would
be
for
rachel
no
said
simon
impatiently
not
caring
tartars
take
new
wives
and
concubines
but
their
chief
wives
hold
that
status
for
life
usually
for
john
to
say
he
wants
to
supplant
his
chief
wife
with
rachel
shows
the
depth
of
his
passion
for
the
girl
father
what
does
all
this
have
to
do
with
sophia
simon
burst
out
i
come
to
that
now
i
had
long
talks
with
rachel
to
find
out
if
she
really
wanted
to
be
rescued
from
the
tartar
she
told
me
about
her
life
before
she
came
to
orvieto
about
what
it
was
like
in
tilia
brothel
and
while
we
talked
rachel
let
slip
some
things
about
sophia
that
i
hate
to
hurt
you
simon
but
she
said
things
that
made
me
think
sophia
is
not
what
she
has
seemed
to
be
anger
vibrated
in
simon
voice
i
do
not
want
to
hear
any
brothel
gossip
rachel
is
a
prostitute
and
a
child
what
could
she
know
about
a
woman
like
sophia
he
had
an
urge
to
get
up
and
leave
but
he
realized
that
behind
his
anger
and
fanning
it
lurked
the
fear
of
learning
something
he
did
not
want
to
know
friar
mathieu
put
a
gentle
hand
on
simon
arm
did
you
tell
sophia
about
count
amalric
treason
and
about
who
your
real
father
is
yes
because
you
wanted
her
to
know
you
if
you
love
sophia
and
want
to
marry
her
you
have
to
know
all
about
her
there
is
no
other
way
but
i
want
her
to
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
to
tell
perhaps
she
can
not
blood
of
christ
why
are
you
torturing
me
the
old
priest
shook
his
head
do
you
understand
that
if
there
were
any
way
out
of
this
conversation
for
me
i
would
take
it
simon
looked
at
the
faded
old
eyes
and
saw
the
pain
yes
i
do
not
want
to
tell
you
what
rachel
said
i
respect
her
confidence
and
i
do
not
like
passing
on
suspicions
like
this
come
and
talk
with
her
yourself
right
now
here
in
this
palace
simon
shivered
with
an
inner
cold
yes
de
verceuil
and
the
tartars
have
been
invited
to
a
supper
at
the
palazzo
papale
rachel
is
alone
in
her
room
i
made
sure
of
that
a
little
while
ago
feeling
like
a
man
going
obediently
to
his
own
beheading
simon
said
let
us
go
and
talk
to
her
then
in
the
corridor
simon
saw
sordello
and
thierry
your
bath
is
ready
monseigneur
said
thierry
i
will
bathe
later
said
simon
trying
not
to
let
the
whirlwind
of
his
emotions
show
in
his
face
there
is
no
way
to
keep
the
water
warm
your
signory
said
sordello
let
it
freeze
simon
shouted
he
turned
away
quickly
and
followed
friar
mathieu
simon
at
first
did
not
see
the
small
figure
huddled
in
a
far
corner
of
the
high
bed
rachel
room
on
the
floor
below
simon
was
much
bigger
than
his
the
outer
wall
which
curved
slightly
because
it
was
part
of
the
old
temple
was
lined
with
white
marble
a
large
window
admitted
dim
light
through
oiled
parchment
and
curtains
rachel
said
friar
mathieu
softly
in
italian
here
is
the
count
de
gobignon
whom
i
told
you
of
he
is
in
charge
of
the
men
who
guard
your
protector
he
is
madonna
sophia
friend
she
has
asked
him
to
try
to
help
you
simon
felt
a
twinge
of
guilt
could
he
be
sophia
friend
if
he
was
trying
to
get
rachel
to
reveal
sophia
secrets
but
sophia
had
disappeared
without
a
word
to
him
if
she
had
secrets
he
had
to
know
them
even
if
he
had
to
deceive
this
child
to
get
at
them
but
at
the
same
time
he
desperately
wanted
to
learn
nothing
about
sophia
that
would
hurt
him
rachel
used
a
red
ribbon
to
mark
her
place
in
the
book
she
was
reading
climbed
down
from
her
bed
and
curtsied
to
simon
her
skin
was
as
white
as
the
marble
on
the
wall
she
wore
a
pale
blue
gown
her
small
breasts
pushed
it
out
in
front
ever
so
slightly
simon
could
see
why
sophia
had
kept
referring
to
her
as
a
child
he
could
not
imagine
how
anyone
even
a
tartar
could
want
to
couple
with
so
a
creature
with
books
to
read
and
a
spacious
chamber
she
must
feel
like
a
he
forgot
his
own
anguish
momentarily
in
pity
for
her
plight
he
wanted
to
take
the
girl
gently
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
simon
and
friar
mathieu
sat
on
small
chairs
and
rachel
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
simon
racked
his
brain
for
a
way
to
start
the
conversation
it
must
seem
to
be
about
rachel
but
it
must
tell
him
about
sophia
he
was
not
even
sure
what
he
was
trying
to
find
out
even
though
he
had
not
spoken
and
had
tried
to
look
friendly
and
not
threatening
he
could
imagine
how
much
his
presence
must
frighten
her
a
french
count
to
her
that
must
almost
be
like
being
visited
by
a
king
and
she
probably
feared
christians
anyway
if
she
decided
she
must
protect
sophia
from
him
he
would
get
nothing
from
her
simon
was
grateful
when
friar
mathieu
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
count
simon
is
anxious
about
your
welfare
my
dear
said
the
old
franciscan
he
was
quite
surprised
to
learn
that
cardinal
ugolini
and
madonna
sophia
had
not
followed
the
pope
here
to
viterbo
he
was
wondering
whether
madonna
sophia
had
left
some
word
with
you
about
where
she
was
going
rachel
shook
her
head
i
have
not
seen
her
since
john
took
me
from
madama
tilia
house
her
black
hair
was
wound
in
braids
around
her
head
exposing
her
small
ears
made
to
look
smaller
still
by
the
large
gold
hoops
she
wore
in
them
similarly
a
gold
necklace
with
a
jeweled
pendant
emphasized
the
slenderness
of
her
neck
her
arms
and
hands
seemed
weighed
down
with
bracelets
and
rings
the
tartar
must
be
showering
her
with
gifts
and
madonna
sophia
gave
no
hint
of
her
plans
when
she
visited
you
at
madama
tilia
friar
mathieu
asked
it
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
question
in
the
world
god
what
would
sophia
be
doing
at
tilia
caballo
at
a
brothel
simon
felt
his
stomach
clench
he
did
not
want
to
hear
rachel
answer
no
father
the
last
thing
she
told
me
was
that
everyone
would
be
leaving
orvieto
soon
and
when
we
did
i
would
not
have
to
stay
with
madama
tilia
anymore
i
begged
her
to
take
me
back
with
her
to
cardinal
ugolini
but
she
said
she
could
not
later
that
day
john
came
for
me
i
never
spoke
with
madonna
sophia
again
she
looked
uneasily
at
simon
sophia
had
said
she
knew
about
the
girl
only
through
the
gossip
of
servants
and
townspeople
could
this
girl
be
lying
about
having
met
sophia
but
she
would
have
no
reason
to
do
that
so
it
must
have
been
sophia
who
lied
about
never
having
met
rachel
he
felt
as
if
a
dagger
had
struck
him
in
the
back
and
she
had
certainly
never
said
anything
about
going
to
tilia
caballo
how
could
he
learn
the
true
connection
between
sophia
and
rachel
without
making
rachel
suspicious
that
is
just
it
rachel
he
said
things
have
been
happening
so
rapidly
and
i
was
away
from
the
pope
court
and
the
tartar
ambassadors
for
months
sophia
and
i
have
not
had
time
to
talk
to
each
other
or
to
send
messages
but
when
i
last
saw
her
she
asked
me
to
look
after
you
she
cares
very
much
for
you
rachel
smiled
faintly
her
lips
were
a
pale
pink
her
eyebrows
were
black
and
straight
over
her
dark
brown
eyes
giving
her
an
earnest
look
oh
yes
your
signory
i
know
she
cares
for
me
are
you
also
from
sicily
rachel
simon
asked
did
you
know
family
in
sicily
no
your
signory
i
am
from
florence
florence
florence
was
controlled
by
the
ghibellini
does
anyone
in
your
family
know
you
are
here
with
this
tartar
is
there
anyone
you
would
like
me
to
get
a
message
to
rachel
eyes
widened
and
filled
with
tears
they
are
all
dead
your
signory
and
if
any
of
them
were
living
i
would
rather
be
dead
myself
than
have
them
know
what
has
happened
to
me
then
sophia
is
the
only
friend
you
have
in
the
world
simon
waited
a
moment
then
tried
a
blind
guess
perhaps
sophia
has
gone
back
to
the
place
where
you
first
met
her
no
no
said
rachel
suddenly
she
looked
terrified
she
shrank
back
from
simon
is
dreadfully
simon
thought
friar
mathieu
was
right
sophia
was
hiding
something
anguish
stabbed
simon
again
what
is
it
rachel
said
friar
mathieu
he
shook
his
head
at
simon
if
you
want
to
help
me
if
you
love
her
just
leave
me
alone
she
was
kind
to
me
as
no
one
else
has
ever
been
she
was
my
friend
stop
trying
to
find
out
about
her
what
was
this
girl
hiding
what
was
sophia
hiding
simon
felt
as
if
he
were
surrounded
by
enemies
all
of
them
plunging
their
daggers
into
him
does
a
friend
send
a
young
girl
like
you
to
a
brothel
said
friar
mathieu
softly
this
brought
no
reply
from
rachel
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
sobbed
simon
could
bear
no
more
he
stood
up
abruptly
he
was
torturing
this
girl
and
in
a
way
she
was
torturing
him
he
said
rachel
we
will
leave
now
i
am
sorry
i
frightened
you
in
truth
i
have
no
wish
to
hurt
you
but
i
i
am
upset
too
listen
to
me
if
you
ever
decide
you
want
to
get
away
from
here
tell
me
i
will
not
let
john
or
cardinal
de
verceuil
or
anyone
else
stop
you
if
you
want
to
be
free
rachel
took
her
hands
away
from
her
face
where
can
i
go
tell
me
that
your
signory
where
can
i
go
her
eyes
rimmed
with
red
from
crying
were
pools
of
darkness
in
her
pale
face
the
sight
of
her
tears
made
simon
own
eyes
burn
friar
mathieu
stood
up
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick
he
took
arm
whispered
a
to
rachel
and
drew
simon
out
of
the
room
silently
they
went
back
up
to
the
loggia
simon
seethed
and
churned
his
mind
full
of
confusion
and
pain
they
sat
together
on
a
bench
in
the
deepening
twilight
the
sun
was
down
and
the
sky
over
the
distant
hills
was
how
clumsy
i
was
simon
said
she
will
tell
us
nothing
now
you
learned
quite
a
bit
said
friar
mathieu
if
you
think
about
what
she
told
you
i
know
this
much
said
simon
i
have
been
a
fool
sophia
has
been
lying
to
me
everyone
in
love
is
a
fool
simon
the
more
in
love
the
more
they
want
to
believe
whatever
the
beloved
tells
them
only
a
man
or
woman
in
love
with
god
can
be
a
fool
without
risk
from
the
distant
walls
of
viterbo
the
guards
called
the
hours
to
one
another
their
cries
echoed
against
the
stone
building
fronts
what
did
you
mean
think
about
what
she
told
me
friar
mathieu
sighed
rachel
said
that
sophia
told
her
after
they
left
orvieto
she
would
not
to
stay
with
tilia
caballo
anymore
rachel
was
not
at
caballo
of
her
own
free
will
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
when
i
suggested
that
sophia
sent
her
there
she
did
not
deny
it
simon
felt
another
rush
of
anger
at
friar
mathieu
for
trying
to
make
him
believe
evil
of
sophia
are
you
saying
that
sophia
forced
that
girl
into
a
brothel
father
sophia
is
too
much
of
an
innocent
to
be
a
party
to
anything
like
that
but
he
remembered
that
moment
of
deepest
intimacy
they
had
shared
last
autumn
outside
perugia
the
moment
he
had
delighted
in
reliving
thousands
of
times
she
had
surprised
him
with
the
suddenness
of
her
passion
with
the
swift
sure
way
she
had
guided
him
into
taking
her
and
had
taken
pleasure
from
him
of
course
he
had
thought
she
would
know
what
to
do
she
had
been
married
but
surely
a
chaste
widow
who
had
known
only
one
man
in
her
life
would
have
shown
some
hesitation
some
timidity
some
inner
struggle
simon
felt
rage
building
up
within
him
he
hated
these
doubts
he
wanted
to
lash
out
at
someone
friar
mathieu
voice
came
to
him
again
mild
but
inexorable
rachel
said
she
asked
sophia
to
take
her
to
ugolini
rachel
must
have
lived
at
ugolini
when
she
first
came
to
orvieto
if
you
say
that
sophia
could
not
have
been
the
one
who
put
rachel
in
caballo
house
i
accept
it
but
ugolini
could
have
or
david
of
trebizond
you
will
drive
me
mad
stop
going
step
by
step
like
a
schoolman
of
what
are
you
accusing
sophia
only
his
reverence
for
friar
mathieu
kept
him
from
shaking
the
old
priest
friar
mathieu
patted
simon
knee
i
am
going
step
by
step
because
i
myself
am
trying
to
think
this
out
and
i
want
to
be
sure
for
your
sake
rachel
knew
something
or
had
learned
something
so
they
put
her
in
caballo
brothel
for
safekeeping
they
ugolini
david
of
trebizond
and
sophia
at
the
very
least
must
have
known
the
reason
or
she
would
not
agree
to
let
rachel
go
to
the
brothel
if
sophia
knew
so
much
then
perhaps
i
say
perhaps
she
knew
more
about
ugolini
and
david
and
their
dealings
than
she
admitted
to
you
i
keep
thinking
of
that
night
at
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
when
she
drew
you
to
the
atrium
conveniently
for
david
of
trebizond
who
was
goading
the
tartars
into
publicly
embarrassing
themselves
was
she
as
uninvolved
then
as
she
led
you
to
believe
each
of
friar
mathieu
sentences
was
another
dagger
blow
plunging
deep
into
simon
sending
agony
through
him
the
sharp
point
searching
out
his
heart
friar
mathieu
was
proceeding
in
the
same
painstaking
way
he
had
probed
alain
body
until
he
discovered
what
killed
him
alain
whose
murderer
had
never
been
found
who
had
died
outside
ugolini
mansion
oh
my
god
could
she
have
known
how
he
was
killed
had
really
been
happening
at
ugolini
mansion
simon
bent
double
digging
his
fingers
into
his
skull
his
head
might
burst
apart
if
he
did
not
hold
it
tightly
could
all
the
love
he
thought
he
had
found
in
her
be
a
lie
could
she
be
an
you
are
destroying
my
life
he
muttered
his
hands
over
his
face
he
felt
the
light
touch
of
the
old
man
hand
on
his
shoulder
when
a
leg
wound
festers
the
surgeon
has
to
cut
the
leg
off
to
save
the
life
the
old
soldiers
tell
me
the
man
always
dies
simon
thought
bitterly
i
am
doing
this
not
just
for
you
simon
friar
mathieu
went
on
there
was
a
secret
war
being
waged
in
orvieto
to
prevent
us
from
allying
ourselves
with
the
tartars
the
person
behind
it
was
probably
king
manfred
of
sicily
who
wants
to
keep
charles
out
of
italy
ugolini
was
manfred
agent
and
sophia
may
have
been
ugolini
weapon
against
you
impossible
i
love
her
i
could
not
love
her
if
she
were
on
the
side
of
simon
struck
his
knee
with
his
fist
i
must
find
out
the
truth
i
must
go
after
her
after
sophia
yes
if
she
is
in
manfred
kingdom
i
will
find
her
and
get
her
out
whatever
sophia
has
done
she
has
already
done
simon
you
can
not
undo
it
or
simply
pretend
that
she
has
done
nothing
at
all
simon
lurched
to
his
feet
staggering
in
his
agony
as
if
those
knives
were
still
striking
him
from
all
sides
he
reached
the
railing
of
the
loggia
and
gripped
it
the
sky
had
deepened
to
violet
and
a
single
silvery
star
glowed
in
the
west
he
remembered
the
magic
his
mother
had
taught
him
of
wishing
on
a
star
he
could
not
wish
this
awful
pain
away
i
do
not
know
what
she
has
done
and
i
refuse
to
believe
ill
of
her
until
i
have
spoken
to
her
but
you
can
not
go
into
manfred
kingdom
and
look
for
her
you
are
certain
to
be
caught
and
imprisoned
you
could
very
well
be
killed
simon
turned
friar
mathieu
was
a
dim
figure
huddled
in
the
deep
shadows
of
the
loggia
his
beard
a
light
patch
in
the
darkness
you
think
manfred
is
behind
all
this
simon
said
yes
look
you
when
urban
died
and
clement
was
elected
it
was
the
letter
you
carried
from
king
louis
that
broke
the
stalemate
ugolini
and
sophia
saw
they
could
do
no
more
at
the
papal
court
and
they
left
maybe
they
were
afraid
they
would
be
discovered
manfred
simon
knew
little
about
king
manfred
up
to
now
he
had
hardly
any
reason
to
dislike
him
and
so
had
no
reason
to
join
count
charles
in
making
war
on
him
now
all
was
changed
it
plainly
had
to
be
to
manfred
that
sophia
had
fled
and
if
sophia
had
betrayed
him
she
must
be
serving
manfred
and
mathieu
was
right
he
could
not
go
alone
into
manfred
kingdom
and
bring
sophia
out
if
she
had
lied
and
betrayed
him
she
not
only
would
refuse
to
come
with
him
she
doubtless
would
betray
him
again
and
he
would
end
up
a
prisoner
but
there
was
another
way
he
could
go
after
sophia
with
an
army
at
his
back
yes
he
would
go
to
gobignon
and
send
out
his
heralds
he
would
summon
his
vassals
to
a
council
of
war
at
the
château
then
after
the
harvest
was
in
he
would
ride
forth
under
the
purple
and
gold
banner
of
the
three
crowns
with
all
the
power
of
gobignon
behind
him
he
would
find
sophia
if
he
had
to
tear
manfred
kingdom
apart
to
do
it
find
her
and
get
the
truth
as
his
wife
or
as
prisoner
she
would
be
his
lxiv
on
a
dais
high
above
simon
on
a
gilded
throne
under
a
canopy
charles
sat
wearing
the
crown
studded
with
rubies
emeralds
and
sapphires
placed
on
his
head
by
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
as
legate
for
pope
clement
a
few
hours
ago
simon
stood
below
him
in
a
of
roman
nobles
and
charles
commanders
the
tartars
and
friar
mathieu
were
beside
simon
behind
them
the
great
hall
of
the
palazzo
laterano
roman
residence
of
the
pope
was
packed
with
french
seigneurs
and
knights
and
the
popolo
grosso
of
rome
the
hall
was
stifling
and
simon
felt
sweat
trickling
inside
his
tunic
even
in
early
may
rome
was
already
too
hot
to
live
in
he
wondered
how
anjou
and
his
army
would
manage
to
survive
the
summer
here
anjou
beckoned
to
gautier
du
mont
who
swept
his
cap
from
his
head
of
hair
and
hurried
up
the
dozen
steps
a
sword
that
reached
to
his
ankle
swinging
at
his
side
simon
felt
a
hollow
in
his
stomach
large
enough
to
hold
all
of
rome
soon
charles
would
call
him
up
to
the
throne
and
he
would
have
to
give
him
an
answer
a
month
ago
in
viterbo
he
had
been
determined
to
bring
the
gobignon
army
to
italy
in
the
intervening
days
doubts
had
unsettled
him
did
he
really
dare
to
commit
the
fighting
men
of
his
domain
to
the
war
each
time
he
tried
to
decide
his
mind
gave
a
different
answer
like
dice
endlessly
tossed
his
head
ached
and
his
eyes
burned
from
lying
awake
all
last
night
after
his
arrival
in
rome
just
in
time
for
the
coronation
over
and
over
again
he
heard
what
friar
mathieu
had
said
so
long
ago
you
even
doubted
your
right
to
be
count
de
gobignon
and
are
you
now
ready
to
lead
the
men
of
gobignon
to
bloodshed
and
for
many
of
them
death
du
mont
had
finished
his
conversation
with
charles
and
with
repeated
bows
was
descending
from
the
dais
with
his
face
toward
the
throne
and
his
hindquarters
to
the
gathering
now
that
anjou
was
a
king
one
did
not
turn
one
back
on
him
a
far
cry
from
du
mont
behavior
toward
charles
of
only
a
few
months
earlier
and
another
mark
of
increased
stature
since
his
arrival
at
the
gates
of
rome
still
he
had
been
required
to
compromise
on
his
coronation
he
had
been
crowned
in
rome
as
he
wanted
but
not
by
the
pope
only
de
verceuil
who
felt
himself
exalted
by
the
occasion
was
perfectly
happy
with
that
arrangement
as
du
mont
rejoined
the
crowd
at
the
base
of
the
throne
simon
eye
was
drawn
to
the
red
silk
cross
sewn
on
his
blue
tunic
after
the
coronation
the
pope
proclamation
of
a
crusade
against
manfred
had
been
read
charles
men
must
have
had
their
crosses
sewn
on
in
anticipation
men
like
du
mont
von
regensburg
and
fitztrinian
were
now
holy
warriors
all
of
whose
past
sins
were
forgiven
if
any
of
followers
should
die
in
battle
they
would
go
straight
to
heaven
having
seen
those
cutthroats
in
action
simon
thought
their
new
state
of
holiness
absurd
but
now
that
pope
clement
had
declared
the
war
against
manfred
a
crusade
it
would
be
so
much
easier
to
recruit
an
army
from
gobignon
simon
wore
no
cross
an
outward
sign
of
his
indecision
an
equerry
in
red
and
black
whispered
to
friar
mathieu
who
turned
and
spoke
to
the
tartars
john
and
philip
ceremoniously
unbuckled
their
jeweled
belts
and
draped
them
over
their
necks
as
the
bowlegged
little
men
started
up
the
steps
simon
heard
snickers
from
among
officers
at
this
tartar
gesture
of
submission
the
more
fools
they
he
thought
to
laugh
at
the
customs
of
men
who
had
conquered
half
the
earth
friar
mathieu
followed
the
tartars
holding
the
equerry
arm
innumerable
conversations
echoing
against
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
great
lateran
hall
battered
on
simon
ears
to
his
right
he
heard
cardinal
de
verceuil
deep
booming
unwillingly
he
turned
and
saw
the
cardinal
red
hat
its
heavy
tassels
swinging
rising
above
the
crowd
as
did
the
voice
coming
from
beneath
it
de
verceuil
was
happy
to
dress
like
a
cardinal
today
since
he
was
taking
the
place
of
the
pope
simon
knew
he
would
soon
be
trading
his
scarlet
regalia
for
mail
eager
to
share
in
the
spoils
of
manfred
kingdom
he
was
going
back
to
france
to
raise
an
army
from
his
fiefs
and
benefices
scattered
around
the
country
simon
saw
several
other
cardinals
hats
here
and
there
in
the
crowd
he
wondered
if
any
of
the
italian
cardinals
supported
charles
adventure
none
of
them
disapproved
openly
that
was
certain
only
ugolini
had
protested
and
his
form
of
protest
had
been
flight
enough
to
cost
him
his
red
hat
by
papal
decree
adelberto
ugolini
was
no
longer
of
palermo
simon
had
sought
out
priests
and
merchants
traveling
from
southern
italy
asking
them
what
had
become
of
ugolini
but
news
from
the
south
was
sparse
these
days
and
news
of
ugolini
nonexistent
simon
had
spoken
in
viterbo
to
a
pair
of
dominican
friars
recently
come
from
palermo
they
had
known
ugolini
before
he
became
a
cardinal
but
did
not
remember
that
he
had
any
sisters
much
less
a
niece
they
had
never
heard
of
a
siracusa
family
called
orfali
simon
raged
at
his
inability
to
learn
anything
at
all
about
sophia
it
was
as
if
she
had
fallen
into
a
black
pit
john
and
philip
were
kneeling
before
charles
at
the
top
of
the
steps
friar
mathieu
stood
beside
the
tartars
interpreting
for
them
and
for
king
charles
charles
was
talking
loudly
enough
for
simon
to
hear
like
many
men
he
tended
to
raise
his
voice
when
addressing
those
who
did
not
speak
his
language
you
must
tell
the
great
abagha
khan
that
it
is
customary
for
rulers
to
send
gifts
to
newly
made
kings
tell
him
we
look
forward
with
delight
to
the
wonderful
things
he
will
send
us
from
the
orient
more
useful
in
simon
opinion
would
be
a
detailed
proposal
from
the
late
hulagu
khan
son
on
how
and
when
christians
and
tartars
should
launch
their
war
on
the
saracens
stories
had
come
from
the
east
that
hulagu
khan
frustration
over
his
failure
to
conquer
the
mamelukes
had
hastened
his
death
as
he
waited
to
climb
the
stairs
and
kneel
before
the
new
king
simon
reminded
himself
that
he
could
still
refuse
to
join
charles
war
on
manfred
he
became
aware
of
the
dull
pain
around
his
heart
that
had
been
with
him
ever
since
he
discovered
that
sophia
had
vanished
even
when
he
forgot
the
suffering
it
weighed
down
his
footsteps
and
bowed
his
shoulders
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
would
rather
live
perpetually
with
this
misery
than
stop
loving
but
how
could
he
go
on
loving
her
if
she
had
been
his
enemy
all
along
was
there
any
such
person
as
sophia
orfali
all
the
time
he
was
courting
her
she
could
have
been
working
against
the
alliance
she
might
even
have
known
the
man
in
black
who
had
nearly
killed
him
that
thought
struck
him
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
for
a
moment
he
was
blind
to
the
sights
around
him
deaf
to
the
sounds
it
can
not
be
if
she
really
had
been
that
evil
it
could
be
only
because
she
had
been
corrupted
by
living
in
manfred
kingdom
he
remembered
the
words
of
de
verceuil
sermon
this
morning
at
count
charles
coronation
hohenstaufens
that
brood
of
vipers
have
too
long
vexed
holy
church
persecuting
pope
after
pope
may
it
please
god
that
the
bastard
manfred
be
the
last
of
them
may
we
see
the
destruction
of
that
family
of
blasphemers
and
infidels
secretly
in
league
with
the
saracens
we
declare
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
anathema
and
outlaw
blessed
be
the
hand
that
strikes
him
if
it
was
manfred
who
had
turned
sophia
into
a
tool
of
the
infidels
then
how
right
that
simon
hand
be
the
one
to
strike
manfred
down
now
bowing
the
tartars
were
carefully
backing
down
from
the
royal
presence
friar
mathieu
turned
and
teetered
precariously
at
the
top
of
the
steps
charles
seeming
not
to
understand
the
infirmity
stared
at
him
without
moving
from
his
seat
the
equerry
who
had
helped
him
climb
made
a
move
toward
him
but
simon
was
already
up
the
steps
and
gripping
the
old
franciscan
arm
thank
you
simon
friar
mathieu
turned
to
charles
sire
i
hope
you
will
forgive
the
sight
of
this
old
man
back
i
am
afraid
my
legs
lack
the
power
to
climb
downstairs
backward
to
be
sure
father
to
be
sure
charles
waved
a
hand
in
dismissal
if
king
louis
were
on
that
throne
simon
thought
he
would
probably
have
lifted
friar
mathieu
in
his
own
arms
and
carried
him
down
simon
so
wished
it
were
louis
rather
than
charles
he
was
serving
but
perhaps
by
serving
charles
he
was
serving
louis
perhaps
simon
and
friar
mathieu
descended
a
step
at
a
time
friar
mathieu
was
leaning
on
simon
but
he
seemed
to
weigh
nothing
count
simon
charles
called
when
simon
reached
the
bottom
i
would
speak
with
you
next
when
simon
mounted
the
dais
charles
ordered
his
herald
in
red
and
black
to
call
for
silence
all
honor
to
simon
count
de
gobignon
charles
called
from
the
throne
when
he
had
the
attention
of
the
assembly
for
nearly
two
years
he
has
guarded
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
he
has
risked
his
very
life
in
battle
for
them
his
sagacity
and
bravery
have
brought
new
glory
to
his
ancient
name
simon
felt
dizzy
with
exaltation
he
had
not
expected
this
from
the
newly
crowned
king
his
face
burned
at
a
gesture
from
charles
he
turned
to
face
the
crowd
the
gathering
in
the
great
hall
of
the
lateran
was
a
multicolored
murmuring
blur
the
dais
on
which
he
stood
seemed
suddenly
turned
into
a
mountaintop
now
charles
went
on
count
simon
and
his
vassals
join
us
as
allies
in
battle
against
the
godless
manfred
may
the
deeds
he
has
yet
to
do
bring
even
more
renown
to
the
house
of
gobignon
i
guarantee
you
messeigneurs
the
day
will
come
when
simon
de
gobignon
will
be
known
as
one
of
christendom
greatest
knights
simon
bedazzlement
at
charles
tribute
to
him
turned
in
an
instant
to
anger
by
publicly
announcing
a
decision
simon
had
not
yet
made
charles
was
trying
to
force
him
to
commit
himself
to
the
crusade
for
a
moment
simon
was
tempted
to
tell
charles
that
he
would
crusade
at
his
side
when
the
middle
sea
froze
over
but
as
he
stood
looking
down
at
charles
barons
and
the
nobles
of
rome
half
turned
toward
charles
half
turned
toward
the
assembly
the
clapping
and
cheering
were
overwhelming
him
his
eye
was
drawn
by
a
red
hat
above
the
rest
of
the
crowd
and
he
was
delighted
to
see
that
de
verceuil
face
seemed
a
deeper
red
than
his
vestments
simon
anger
at
charles
faded
as
the
moment
lifted
him
up
in
spite
of
himself
he
who
had
dwelt
in
the
shadow
of
treason
all
his
life
who
had
hidden
himself
when
in
great
assemblies
for
fear
he
would
be
noticed
and
treated
with
scorn
now
honored
by
this
multitude
in
the
capital
of
christendom
in
the
palace
of
the
popes
was
it
not
to
achieve
this
that
he
had
come
to
italy
only
sophia
could
he
did
what
he
felt
was
required
and
knelt
before
charles
taking
the
new
king
extended
hand
and
kissing
a
huge
ruby
ring
in
a
low
voice
charles
said
i
have
prayed
that
i
would
have
your
help
simon
can
you
not
tell
me
that
my
prayer
has
been
answered
if
he
refused
charles
and
went
back
to
gobignon
he
would
never
see
sophia
again
and
he
would
probably
never
again
know
a
moment
like
this
when
he
felt
so
as
the
count
de
gobignon
but
he
was
still
offended
by
charles
claiming
a
commitment
that
simon
had
not
given
him
it
seems
you
already
know
your
prayer
has
been
answered
sire
charles
frowned
for
a
moment
then
smiled
and
patted
simon
on
the
shoulder
forgive
me
i
want
so
much
for
you
to
join
me
that
i
spoke
as
if
it
were
already
true
will
you
make
it
true
he
looked
up
into
charles
large
compelling
eyes
and
nodded
slowly
i
will
come
after
the
harvest
is
in
sire
i
will
come
with
my
army
rachel
slid
from
the
bed
trying
to
shake
it
as
little
as
possible
so
as
not
to
wake
john
letting
her
robe
of
yellow
silk
flutter
loosely
about
her
nude
body
she
hurried
behind
the
screen
that
hid
her
commode
and
opened
the
chest
that
held
her
most
private
belongings
she
took
out
the
device
of
bladder
and
tubing
tilia
had
given
her
long
ago
and
with
a
pitcherful
of
lukewarm
water
washed
john
seed
out
of
herself
quickly
over
the
year
and
more
that
she
had
been
with
john
she
had
never
let
him
see
her
using
the
thing
men
such
as
john
she
knew
took
pride
in
their
power
to
get
a
woman
with
child
she
was
fourteen
now
and
her
breasts
were
filling
out
many
women
had
babies
at
fourteen
she
would
have
to
be
more
careful
than
ever
she
stretched
her
mouth
in
a
grimace
at
the
thought
of
a
baby
that
looked
like
john
as
usual
she
had
endured
not
enjoyed
the
tartar
mating
another
change
she
had
noticed
in
herself
though
was
that
she
had
begun
to
understand
how
women
could
feel
pleasure
with
a
man
several
times
since
last
spring
a
man
had
appeared
naked
before
her
in
her
dreams
and
had
lain
with
her
when
she
woke
she
could
not
remember
the
man
face
but
she
still
felt
the
exquisite
sensations
his
body
gave
her
and
she
sometimes
had
to
caress
herself
until
a
surge
of
pleasure
relieved
the
yearning
stirred
up
by
her
dream
other
times
when
john
came
to
her
late
at
night
and
she
was
very
sleepy
she
closed
her
eyes
and
was
able
to
imagine
that
the
man
was
with
her
and
then
she
actually
enjoyed
attentions
which
pleased
him
very
much
she
tied
the
robe
sash
and
went
to
the
window
the
breeze
from
the
west
was
strong
and
and
she
was
thankful
that
she
was
here
in
a
villa
by
the
sea
and
not
in
rome
august
they
said
killed
one
out
of
every
three
people
in
rome
she
sat
on
the
wide
sill
and
looked
out
she
did
not
lean
out
too
far
she
was
four
stories
up
overlooking
jagged
boulders
piled
along
the
shore
afternoon
sunlight
sparkled
on
the
tyrrhenean
sea
and
a
flash
of
sun
on
the
helmet
of
a
guard
patrolling
the
beach
caught
her
eye
one
of
sordello
venetians
she
thought
judging
by
his
helmet
and
the
crossbow
he
carried
the
of
the
orsini
family
who
had
lent
this
villa
to
the
french
party
wore
helmets
shaped
to
the
head
with
crests
on
top
she
heard
the
bed
creaking
behind
her
and
the
tartar
groaned
pour
me
another
cup
of
wine
reicho
he
called
you
have
had
three
cups
already
usun
she
said
but
obediently
went
to
the
table
and
poured
red
wine
from
a
flagon
into
his
silver
cup
he
had
taught
her
his
original
tartar
name
usun
and
he
liked
to
hear
her
say
it
with
the
help
of
friar
mathieu
and
ana
the
bulgarian
she
had
learned
to
understand
and
speak
his
language
fairly
well
she
knew
now
that
tartar
was
merely
a
european
word
for
his
people
that
they
called
themselves
mongols
he
pulled
his
silk
trousers
up
and
knotted
the
drawstring
his
belly
had
been
flat
when
she
first
met
him
now
it
was
swollen
as
if
were
having
a
baby
and
excess
flesh
sagged
on
his
shoulders
and
chest
his
decline
was
partly
from
too
much
wine
and
partly
from
too
little
activity
she
rarely
saw
john
without
a
wine
cup
in
his
hand
and
by
evening
he
was
often
surly
or
in
a
stupor
he
talked
to
her
less
and
was
less
often
able
to
couple
with
her
if
he
spent
many
more
months
like
this
he
would
sicken
and
die
like
a
wild
bird
kept
in
a
cage
i
had
cups
this
morning
before
i
came
to
you
he
boasted
wine
makes
me
strong
he
drank
off
half
his
cup
and
set
it
on
the
marble
table
she
sat
beside
him
on
the
rumpled
bed
you
need
to
get
out
usun
go
riding
he
shrugged
too
hot
he
grinned
stroking
his
white
beard
but
next
year
we
will
ride
to
war
next
year
king
charr
has
promised
to
let
me
and
nikpai
philip
ride
to
war
with
him
when
he
attacks
manfred
in
her
anxiety
she
seized
john
arm
she
rarely
touched
him
and
said
you
must
insist
that
your
guardians
let
you
go
out
riding
regularly
and
you
must
stop
drinking
so
much
wine
otherwise
you
will
be
very
sick
his
black
eyes
were
wider
and
moister
than
usual
you
worry
about
me
reicho
she
took
her
hand
from
his
arm
i
do
want
to
see
you
die
she
said
she
did
not
know
why
she
felt
that
way
after
all
he
had
enslaved
her
and
every
time
he
possessed
her
body
it
was
virtually
rape
and
if
he
died
she
might
be
free
but
she
supposed
she
had
gotten
to
know
him
so
well
that
she
felt
sorry
for
him
she
did
not
like
to
hear
about
this
war
against
king
manfred
friar
mathieu
had
told
her
gently
that
her
lost
friends
sophia
david
and
the
others
were
very
likely
all
spies
for
manfred
if
sophia
were
in
king
manfred
employ
that
made
no
difference
to
rachel
from
all
she
had
heard
jews
were
better
treated
in
manfred
kingdom
than
anywhere
else
in
italy
the
french
on
the
other
hand
were
often
cruel
to
jews
it
would
bring
sorrow
and
suffering
to
many
people
if
charles
conquered
southern
italy
and
sicily
she
wished
she
could
be
with
sophia
but
sophia
was
probably
in
sicily
and
how
could
rachel
all
alone
cross
half
of
italy
to
find
her
the
locked
box
she
kept
under
the
bed
which
held
all
the
gold
and
jewelry
usun
had
given
her
was
far
too
big
and
heavy
for
her
to
carry
and
even
if
she
could
escape
and
take
it
away
with
her
she
could
not
protect
herself
from
robbery
but
it
would
be
the
worst
sort
of
stupidity
to
leave
without
it
it
was
all
she
had
from
these
awful
years
it
was
less
like
a
treasure
though
than
like
a
block
of
stone
to
which
she
was
chained
if
she
were
ever
to
escape
she
would
first
have
to
get
away
from
the
guards
the
armenians
and
the
venetians
all
of
whom
had
orders
to
watch
her
and
make
sure
she
did
not
run
away
that
sordello
the
capitano
of
the
venetians
seemed
to
have
his
eyes
on
her
whenever
she
went
out
of
her
room
she
was
alone
in
the
world
nowhere
to
go
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
so
lost
and
unhappy
she
wanted
to
climb
out
the
open
window
of
her
room
and
throw
herself
down
to
the
rocks
maybe
next
year
when
king
charr
goes
to
war
i
will
not
be
here
usun
said
suddenly
you
must
wish
you
could
be
back
with
your
own
people
she
said
i
am
lonely
think
how
he
must
feel
except
for
philip
there
is
no
one
like
him
anywhere
in
this
part
of
the
world
only
a
few
people
speak
his
language
everything
looks
strange
to
we
are
waiting
for
orders
from
our
new
master
abagha
khan
said
usun
another
letter
must
come
soon
it
is
now
six
months
since
his
father
died
rachel
felt
her
heart
fluttering
with
anxiety
and
when
abagha
message
comes
what
do
you
think
it
will
say
he
will
order
us
either
to
go
to
the
king
of
the
franks
or
to
go
back
to
persia
he
took
a
swallow
of
wine
rachel
saw
that
his
white
beard
was
stained
pink
from
all
the
red
wine
he
had
spilled
on
it
then
you
might
go
home
again
said
rachel
would
you
like
that
her
hands
trembled
and
she
twined
her
fingers
together
in
her
lap
to
still
them
usun
laughed
and
drank
not
home
reicho
my
home
is
farther
away
from
persia
than
persia
is
from
here
it
is
so
far
away
and
there
are
so
many
enemies
in
between
that
i
may
never
see
it
again
but
i
do
not
care
my
people
have
a
fine
domain
in
persia
he
drank
and
held
out
his
empty
cup
she
filled
it
with
a
shaking
hand
if
he
went
back
to
persia
she
might
be
free
of
him
unless
her
worst
fears
turned
out
to
be
true
so
you
may
soon
say
to
me
she
dared
not
let
him
see
how
eager
she
was
for
him
to
be
gone
he
looked
up
at
her
and
the
light
from
outside
etched
the
thousand
tiny
wrinkles
around
his
eyes
no
reicho
if
i
go
back
you
must
come
with
me
her
heart
turned
to
ice
just
as
if
he
had
told
her
he
was
going
to
kill
her
she
had
suspected
this
and
had
prayed
it
would
not
be
so
everything
he
said
and
did
from
the
day
he
took
her
from
tilia
house
showed
that
he
meant
never
to
let
her
go
she
was
to
be
his
prisoner
for
life
usun
she
said
trying
to
keep
her
voice
calm
i
do
not
want
to
go
with
you
he
stared
at
her
his
brown
face
wooden
you
are
afraid
he
said
but
you
must
not
be
when
you
come
with
me
you
will
be
a
very
great
lady
i
am
a
baghadur
i
am
as
great
a
lord
as
king
charr
is
here
i
know
that
people
of
your
religion
are
treated
badly
by
the
christians
among
my
people
all
religions
are
equal
the
the
law
of
genghis
khan
commands
it
when
he
spoke
the
name
genghis
khan
there
was
a
reverence
in
his
voice
like
a
christian
speaking
of
jesus
she
was
reminded
of
tilia
telling
her
why
it
was
better
to
be
a
harlot
than
a
wife
she
wanted
to
weep
with
frustration
as
if
she
had
been
pounding
her
fists
against
a
stone
wall
how
could
a
man
who
seemed
content
to
have
left
his
own
homeland
behind
forever
understand
how
felt
usun
it
does
not
matter
to
me
that
i
am
lowly
here
and
might
be
great
there
this
land
is
where
i
was
born
and
grew
up
and
no
matter
how
much
i
suffer
here
it
is
my
home
i
do
not
want
to
live
among
tartars
and
persians
i
would
be
so
terribly
alone
i
beg
you
do
not
try
to
uproot
me
from
this
land
you
would
not
be
alone
he
said
in
a
low
sad
voice
you
would
have
me
i
could
never
be
happy
with
you
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
say
but
only
the
truth
might
make
him
change
his
mind
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
drained
his
cup
and
thrust
it
at
her
as
if
striking
a
blow
the
flagon
is
empty
she
said
i
will
go
he
stood
up
and
pulled
his
tunic
on
over
his
head
he
was
no
taller
than
she
was
but
as
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
stared
up
at
him
he
seemed
to
loom
over
her
like
a
giant
his
black
gaze
was
empty
of
feeling
as
stone
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
are
happy
you
are
mine
and
you
will
come
with
me
she
shrank
away
from
him
terrified
the
face
he
showed
her
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
dragged
her
naked
through
that
orvieto
street
she
threw
herself
full
length
on
the
bed
sobbing
her
heart
felt
ready
to
burst
with
anguish
god
only
you
can
help
me
send
someone
to
deliver
me
or
i
will
lxv
pride
swelled
daoud
heart
as
he
watched
the
column
of
muslim
cavalry
suddenly
change
direction
and
sweep
like
a
long
roll
of
thunder
through
the
valley
a
flutter
of
orange
banners
on
their
flanks
and
the
men
at
the
far
end
of
the
line
launched
into
an
gallop
while
the
riders
at
the
near
end
slowed
to
a
trot
the
whole
line
pivoted
like
a
great
scythe
enveloping
the
flank
of
an
imaginary
enemy
very
impressive
said
king
manfred
they
get
their
orders
from
those
colored
flags
he
and
daoud
stood
on
the
rounded
brow
of
a
grassy
hill
watching
the
sons
of
the
falcon
displaying
their
skills
for
their
king
the
valley
daoud
had
found
for
the
demonstration
was
a
natural
amphitheater
a
flat
circular
plain
at
least
a
league
in
diameter
surrounded
by
hills
normally
it
was
used
as
grazing
land
for
over
a
year
daoud
had
been
training
these
two
hundred
men
picked
from
hundreds
of
volunteers
from
manfred
saracen
guards
with
so
much
time
he
had
been
able
to
forge
and
polish
the
sons
of
the
falcon
into
a
weapon
that
could
be
the
vanguard
of
manfred
army
he
hoped
that
what
manfred
saw
today
would
put
him
in
a
warlike
mood
a
mood
to
ask
daoud
for
his
advice
he
prayed
for
the
chance
to
urge
manfred
not
to
wait
for
charles
to
invade
his
kingdom
but
to
march
north
and
attack
charles
at
once
god
open
manfred
for
manfred
to
delay
the
start
of
his
war
against
charles
even
this
long
could
well
be
disastrous
a
year
ago
manfred
could
have
moved
out
from
southern
italy
and
smashed
charles
as
a
man
rises
from
his
couch
and
crosses
the
room
to
crush
a
mosquito
sadly
like
many
a
man
who
sees
a
mosquito
across
the
room
manfred
had
chosen
to
remain
on
his
couch
and
the
mosquito
was
fast
growing
into
a
dragon
lorenzo
celino
and
landgrave
erhard
barth
the
grand
marshal
of
manfred
army
stood
on
either
side
of
daoud
and
manfred
scipio
stood
beside
celino
who
rested
his
right
hand
on
the
dog
big
head
half
a
dozen
nobles
and
officers
of
manfred
court
were
gathered
a
short
distance
away
from
the
king
and
his
three
companions
lower
down
the
hillside
scudieros
held
the
party
horses
those
flags
would
be
useless
at
night
said
barth
speaking
italian
with
a
heavy
accent
which
daoud
knew
to
be
that
of
swabia
the
german
state
from
which
manfred
family
came
and
they
would
be
hard
to
see
on
a
rainy
day
he
was
a
man
with
a
snub
nose
all
of
his
upper
front
teeth
were
missing
which
caused
his
upper
lip
to
sink
in
and
his
lower
lip
to
protrude
giving
him
a
permanent
pout
irritated
daoud
spoke
to
manfred
rather
than
to
barth
there
are
many
ways
to
signal
colored
lanterns
at
night
horns
drums
these
men
have
learned
all
those
kinds
of
signals
and
can
respond
to
them
quickly
daoud
muscles
tensed
as
he
thought
that
the
big
german
and
he
might
have
it
out
today
barth
he
felt
sure
was
one
of
the
advisers
who
was
holding
manfred
back
i
like
the
idea
of
signals
said
manfred
in
every
battle
i
have
seen
no
one
knows
what
is
going
on
once
the
two
sides
meet
our
knights
do
not
know
how
to
fight
in
unified
groups
as
the
turks
and
the
tartars
do
the
sons
of
the
falcon
rode
to
the
base
of
the
hill
from
which
manfred
was
reviewing
omar
daoud
second
in
command
spurred
his
horse
up
the
slope
leapt
from
the
saddle
and
rushed
forward
to
kneel
and
kiss
manfred
hand
you
ride
splendidly
said
manfred
in
arabic
tell
the
men
i
am
very
proud
of
them
omar
daoud
said
omar
flashed
bright
white
teeth
at
him
to
manfred
daoud
said
now
sire
if
it
be
your
pleasure
the
sons
of
the
falcon
will
demonstrate
their
skill
in
casting
the
rumh
the
lance
manfred
nodded
and
waved
a
gauntleted
hand
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
riding
cloak
of
emerald
velvet
with
an
unadorned
green
cap
covering
his
light
blond
hair
his
only
jewelry
was
the
silver
star
with
its
ruby
center
which
daoud
had
never
seen
him
without
as
i
still
wear
the
locket
blossoming
reed
gave
omar
bowed
and
vaulted
into
the
saddle
with
an
agility
that
brought
a
grunt
of
appreciation
from
manfred
waving
his
saber
he
rode
back
down
the
hill
a
scaffold
and
swinging
target
for
the
lances
had
been
set
up
halfway
across
the
valley
recalling
his
own
training
and
nicetas
daoud
watched
his
riders
form
a
great
circle
in
the
plain
below
them
he
heard
in
his
mind
a
boy
warbling
battle
cry
and
felt
a
deep
pang
of
sadness
why
do
you
call
them
the
sons
of
the
falcon
daoud
manfred
asked
because
i
know
the
falcon
is
the
favorite
bird
of
your
family
sire
daoud
said
manfred
grinned
and
nodded
he
thought
because
the
falcon
does
not
daoud
admired
manfred
he
was
said
to
be
the
image
of
his
father
and
that
made
it
easy
to
see
why
emperor
frederic
had
been
known
as
the
wonder
of
the
world
to
see
why
sophia
loved
manfred
for
a
but
as
a
war
leader
manfred
was
frustrating
to
work
with
he
seemed
to
have
no
plan
for
fighting
charles
all
over
southern
italy
and
sicily
knights
and
were
in
training
and
on
the
alert
but
days
months
seasons
followed
one
another
and
manfred
ordered
no
action
daoud
own
goal
remained
the
same
he
had
set
for
himself
a
year
ago
in
orvieto
to
spur
manfred
on
to
make
war
and
to
help
him
win
a
victory
and
when
the
war
gave
an
opportunity
daoud
would
once
again
try
to
kill
the
tartar
ambassadors
they
were
now
manfred
agents
in
the
north
reported
in
rome
under
charles
protection
perhaps
he
could
even
rescue
poor
rachel
daoud
smiled
with
pleasure
as
the
riders
below
formed
a
huge
circle
one
man
behind
the
other
he
was
able
to
recognize
individual
men
he
had
come
to
know
over
the
past
months
muslims
from
manfred
army
whom
he
had
picked
and
trained
himself
abdulhak
mujtaba
nuwaihi
tabari
ahmad
said
and
many
others
they
were
as
eager
for
this
war
to
begin
as
he
was
at
a
shouted
command
from
omar
who
sat
on
his
horse
in
the
center
the
circle
began
to
rotate
the
horses
running
faster
and
faster
each
man
balanced
a
lance
in
his
right
hand
and
as
he
rode
past
the
swinging
target
ring
he
hurled
it
the
ring
was
pulled
from
side
to
side
with
long
ropes
by
attendants
just
as
when
daoud
had
trained
as
a
mameluke
as
lance
after
lance
flew
through
the
moving
target
manfred
gave
a
low
whistle
of
appreciation
daoud
had
ordered
the
ring
to
be
a
yard
wide
and
the
distance
from
horseman
to
target
fifty
feet
it
was
easier
than
it
looked
for
men
who
had
practiced
for
months
but
the
rapidity
of
it
made
a
beautiful
spectacle
daoud
eye
caught
a
few
misses
but
he
doubted
that
manfred
noticed
like
falcons
swift
and
fierce
and
sure
said
manfred
but
a
bird
is
just
bone
and
muscle
and
feathers
daoud
these
men
are
lightly
armed
and
armored
compared
to
christian
soldiers
these
two
hundred
of
yours
could
never
stop
a
charge
of
frankish
knights
daoud
tensed
this
was
an
opening
true
sire
when
frankish
knights
in
all
their
mail
get
those
huge
armored
going
at
a
gallop
nothing
can
withstand
them
but
we
mamelukes
have
defeated
the
franks
over
and
over
again
by
not
letting
them
use
their
weight
and
power
to
advantage
they
must
close
with
their
enemy
we
fight
from
a
distance
raining
arrows
down
upon
them
if
the
enemy
pursues
you
flee
until
he
wearies
himself
and
spreads
his
lines
out
then
rush
in
and
cut
him
to
pieces
attack
the
enemy
when
he
is
not
expecting
it
that
might
do
well
enough
in
the
deserts
of
outremer
said
manfred
but
european
warfare
is
different
there
are
mountains
and
rivers
and
forests
we
can
not
spread
out
all
over
the
landscape
daoud
threw
an
exasperated
look
at
lorenzo
whose
dark
eyes
were
sympathetic
but
who
shook
his
head
slightly
as
if
to
warn
daoud
to
be
politic
in
his
argument
with
the
king
there
is
one
principle
that
you
can
adopt
from
mameluke
warfare
said
daoud
choosing
not
to
contradict
manfred
and
that
is
speed
our
swabian
knights
and
our
saracen
warriors
ride
as
swiftly
as
any
in
europe
barth
growled
once
they
get
moving
said
lorenzo
sharply
is
always
politic
thought
daoud
forgive
me
for
speaking
boldly
sire
said
daoud
but
a
whole
summer
has
gone
by
since
pope
clement
proclaimed
a
crusade
against
you
and
declared
that
your
crown
belongs
to
charles
and
there
has
been
no
fighting
is
this
what
you
mean
by
european
warfare
in
the
time
it
takes
europeans
to
get
ready
for
one
war
we
mamelukes
would
have
fought
five
wars
as
he
spoke
he
proudly
recalled
what
an
arab
poet
had
written
of
the
mamelukes
charge
like
lightning
and
arrive
like
manfred
turned
to
watch
the
riders
a
royal
privilege
daoud
thought
to
conduct
an
argument
at
one
chosen
pace
he
pushed
down
the
urge
to
say
more
forced
himself
to
be
patient
waited
tensely
for
manfred
to
reply
in
his
own
time
he
felt
a
movement
beside
him
and
turned
to
see
that
lorenzo
had
moved
closer
to
him
he
gave
lorenzo
a
pleading
look
trying
to
ask
him
to
join
the
discussion
manfred
respected
lorenzo
and
listened
to
him
lorenzo
replied
with
a
frown
and
a
nod
he
seemed
to
be
saying
he
would
speak
up
when
he
judged
the
moment
right
when
the
men
who
had
cast
came
around
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
circle
fresh
lances
thrust
upright
in
the
ground
by
their
servants
were
waiting
for
them
each
warrior
leaned
out
of
the
saddle
seized
a
lance
and
rode
back
around
at
top
speed
to
throw
at
the
target
again
after
a
moment
manfred
turned
back
to
daoud
and
said
charles
has
been
hanging
about
in
rome
all
through
the
spring
and
summer
claiming
to
be
king
of
sicily
this
morning
i
asked
to
see
my
crown
and
my
steward
brought
it
to
me
from
the
vault
the
pope
words
had
not
made
it
disappear
rome
is
not
sicily
anjou
is
welcome
to
stay
in
that
decaying
pesthole
until
he
takes
one
of
those
famous
roman
fevers
and
dies
no
doubt
thought
daoud
manfred
gesture
in
calling
for
his
crown
had
amused
his
whole
court
and
put
heart
into
any
who
feared
growing
strength
manfred
was
charming
no
question
but
meanwhile
charles
who
by
all
accounts
had
not
a
bit
of
charm
in
fact
growing
stronger
day
by
day
those
of
manfred
supporters
who
were
afraid
had
good
reason
and
daoud
was
one
of
them
it
was
agony
to
think
how
the
opportunity
to
beat
charles
now
was
slipping
away
so
you
will
wait
for
charles
to
come
to
you
said
daoud
manfred
smiled
and
he
i
suspect
hopes
that
i
will
come
to
him
charles
has
to
pay
his
army
to
stay
in
italy
the
longer
he
puts
off
attacking
me
the
more
his
treasury
is
depleted
my
army
waits
at
home
sustaining
itself
daoud
said
now
that
charles
war
is
called
a
crusade
barons
and
knights
are
joining
him
from
all
over
christendom
many
of
them
are
paying
their
own
way
sire
when
charles
decides
he
is
ready
to
move
against
you
his
strength
will
be
overwhelming
lorenzo
spoke
up
and
meanwhile
the
pope
has
placed
your
whole
kingdom
under
interdict
no
sacraments
no
masses
couples
can
not
marry
in
church
can
we
weigh
the
pain
of
mothers
and
fathers
who
think
their
babies
that
die
unbaptized
will
never
see
god
and
what
about
the
terror
of
sinners
unable
to
confess
and
the
dying
who
can
not
have
the
last
sacraments
and
the
grief
of
those
who
had
to
bury
their
loved
ones
without
funerals
sire
your
people
have
not
heard
a
church
bell
since
last
may
they
grow
more
restless
and
unhappy
every
day
and
it
does
not
help
your
cause
when
they
see
your
muslim
and
jewish
subjects
freely
practicing
religions
i
am
surprised
to
hear
pay
such
tribute
to
the
power
of
religion
lorenzo
said
manfred
with
that
bright
grin
of
his
the
grim
lines
of
lorenzo
face
were
accentuated
by
the
droop
of
his
black
and
white
mustache
i
have
never
in
my
life
doubted
the
of
religion
sire
having
used
up
all
their
lances
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
now
shooting
arrows
from
horseback
riding
toward
lines
of
stationary
targets
that
had
been
set
up
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
do
you
have
a
proposal
daoud
said
manfred
with
a
sour
look
let
me
hear
it
daoud
felt
an
overwhelming
sense
of
relief
this
was
the
moment
he
had
been
hoping
for
all
day
sire
do
not
wait
for
charles
to
come
out
of
rome
he
said
in
january
february
at
the
latest
assemble
your
army
and
march
north
there
he
had
made
his
cast
would
it
pierce
the
target
i
could
go
all
the
way
to
the
papal
states
only
to
find
charles
lurking
behind
the
walls
of
rome
i
can
not
besiege
rome
that
would
take
ten
times
as
many
men
as
i
have
no
said
daoud
his
army
will
not
let
him
stay
in
rome
by
the
end
of
winter
they
will
have
stolen
everything
in
rome
that
can
be
stolen
charles
will
have
to
promise
them
more
spoils
and
lead
them
to
battle
or
they
will
desert
him
manfred
nodded
thoughtfully
in
truth
greed
is
what
drives
them
daoud
added
and
call
on
your
allies
in
florence
and
siena
and
the
other
ghibellino
cities
to
stop
any
more
of
charles
allies
coming
into
italy
they
can
not
all
come
by
sea
as
he
did
many
times
i
have
heard
people
in
your
court
say
that
charles
has
cut
italy
in
half
nonsense
he
has
put
himself
between
two
millstones
manfred
eyes
lit
up
yes
i
like
that
way
of
looking
at
it
the
sons
of
the
falcon
had
ridden
to
the
far
end
of
the
valley
and
were
now
roaring
back
standing
in
the
saddle
and
firing
arrows
over
the
tails
of
their
horses
sire
said
daoud
not
to
act
is
to
act
he
felt
urgency
building
in
him
as
he
sensed
that
he
was
persuading
manfred
i
remember
my
father
saying
something
like
that
said
manfred
what
do
you
think
erhard
daoud
heart
sank
the
beefy
swabian
would
undoubtedly
counsel
more
waiting
in
thought
landgrave
barth
sucked
in
his
upper
lip
and
pushed
out
the
pendulous
lower
one
until
it
seemed
he
was
trying
to
pull
his
nose
into
his
mouth
anjou
will
have
to
campaign
against
you
soon
sire
for
the
reason
herr
daoud
has
just
given
he
said
slowly
his
men
will
not
allow
him
to
stay
in
rome
and
endure
the
privation
of
a
siege
when
they
learn
you
are
coming
they
will
demand
that
he
march
out
to
meet
you
he
is
probably
planning
an
attack
for
next
april
or
may
when
the
weather
is
best
he
must
expect
reinforcements
but
so
he
does
not
have
to
pay
them
for
long
he
will
not
want
them
to
come
until
the
very
moment
he
is
ready
to
invade
so
if
you
attack
him
in
january
or
february
you
catch
him
unready
he
finished
with
a
vigorous
nod
of
his
head
i
recommend
it
daoud
felt
a
new
and
unexpected
warmth
toward
barth
the
landgrave
was
not
such
a
old
soldier
after
all
the
sons
of
the
falcon
had
finished
their
archery
exercise
in
four
ranks
fifty
mounted
men
abreast
they
drew
up
at
the
base
of
the
hill
and
saluted
manfred
two
hundred
scimitars
flashing
in
the
afternoon
sun
manfred
stepped
forward
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
god
bless
your
arms
he
shouted
in
arabic
the
wild
ululations
of
his
muslim
warriors
echoed
against
the
surrounding
hills
as
manfred
smiling
returned
to
his
companions
he
said
in
three
months
time
then
no
more
than
four
the
weather
will
decide
i
will
call
in
my
barons
one
by
one
and
tell
them
to
prepare
we
must
keep
this
a
secret
for
as
long
as
possible
daoud
lorenzo
and
barth
all
bowed
in
assent
daoud
felt
a
surge
of
joy
he
had
succeeded
in
persuading
manfred
to
strike
at
charles
manfred
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
move
were
sound
ones
he
knew
he
had
spent
long
hours
considering
them
himself
but
he
was
certain
that
if
manfred
did
nothing
he
was
surely
doomed
at
this
moment
manfred
and
charles
were
nearly
evenly
matched
manfred
a
little
stronger
charles
growing
in
strength
to
a
great
extent
it
would
be
luck
or
the
will
of
god
that
determined
the
outcome
daoud
could
not
control
luck
or
god
but
he
could
make
the
best
possible
plan
and
give
his
all
to
it
suddenly
he
badly
wanted
to
get
back
to
sophia
in
lucera
usually
he
enjoyed
being
out
with
the
troops
overseeing
their
training
today
he
begrudged
the
time
every
moment
seemed
precious
three
months
would
be
gone
before
he
and
sophia
realized
it
then
he
would
be
riding
with
manfred
army
perhaps
never
to
see
her
again
he
must
make
sure
she
would
be
safe
no
matter
what
happened
perhaps
ugolini
or
tilia
could
help
sophia
would
want
to
travel
with
the
army
with
him
north
she
was
not
a
woman
to
pine
at
home
while
men
marched
away
he
must
discourage
her
it
was
too
dangerous
but
to
discourage
her
would
probably
be
impossible
simon
listened
to
the
drumming
hooves
behind
him
on
the
dirt
road
and
thought
will
be
hearing
this
sound
all
day
long
every
day
for
he
supposed
that
after
a
while
he
would
no
longer
notice
it
but
today
the
day
after
his
departure
from
château
gobignon
his
ears
seemed
to
ache
from
the
incessant
pounding
and
the
hoofbeats
were
a
constant
reminder
that
he
was
really
leading
the
gobignon
host
to
war
all
summer
long
the
conviction
had
been
growing
upon
him
that
this
was
a
bad
war
and
all
the
suffering
it
caused
all
the
deaths
and
mutilations
would
be
on
his
conscience
forever
no
matter
that
the
pope
had
proclaimed
it
a
holy
crusade
against
the
blasphemer
manfred
popes
could
be
wrong
about
wars
simon
father
roland
had
vividly
described
for
him
the
horrors
of
the
albigensian
crusade
of
a
generation
ago
when
knights
of
northern
france
had
fallen
upon
languedoc
like
a
pack
of
wolves
like
tartars
in
fact
reducing
it
to
ruins
and
that
crusade
had
been
proclaimed
by
a
pope
in
days
to
come
the
rumbling
in
his
ears
would
be
louder
the
feeling
that
he
was
guilty
of
great
wrongdoing
harder
to
bear
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
thirty
knights
mounted
on
their
palfreys
another
twenty
equerries
and
servants
on
smaller
horses
two
priests
on
mules
five
supply
wagons
two
of
them
full
of
weapons
and
armor
one
hundred
foot
soldiers
and
sixty
great
in
strings
a
page
boy
riding
the
lead
horse
in
each
string
this
was
the
gobignon
household
contingent
at
today
end
he
would
have
three
times
that
many
of
every
category
and
by
the
end
of
the
week
his
army
would
have
swollen
to
its
full
size
of
four
hundred
knights
fifteen
hundred
foot
soldiers
and
all
the
equerries
attendants
horses
and
baggage
they
needed
and
a
year
or
more
from
now
how
many
of
them
would
come
back
from
this
war
he
thought
of
alain
de
pirenne
lying
on
a
street
in
orvieto
he
thought
of
teodoro
at
the
monaldeschi
palace
his
chest
crushed
by
a
stone
his
warm
blood
pouring
out
of
his
mouth
over
simon
hand
how
many
of
these
men
would
die
miserably
like
that
thierry
and
valery
de
pirenne
alain
younger
brother
the
two
young
men
who
rode
behind
him
caught
his
eye
and
grinned
delightedly
he
managed
a
smile
in
return
but
feared
it
must
look
awfully
weak
the
bright
red
silk
crosses
sewn
on
their
chests
caught
his
eye
he
wore
one
too
on
the
breast
of
his
purple
and
gold
surcoat
his
oldest
sister
isabelle
a
fine
seamstress
had
sewn
it
there
and
embroidered
the
edges
with
gold
thread
all
three
of
his
sisters
isabelle
alix
and
blanche
had
worked
on
the
crusaders
banner
red
cross
on
white
silk
that
rippled
above
simon
equerries
took
turns
riding
with
the
banner
according
to
a
roster
simon
himself
had
written
beside
the
crusading
flag
another
equerry
carried
the
banner
of
the
house
of
gobignon
three
gold
crowns
two
side
by
side
and
one
below
them
on
a
purple
background
his
sisters
three
husbands
rode
to
war
behind
him
today
since
he
was
unmarried
and
had
no
heir
one
of
them
would
be
count
de
gobignon
if
he
should
fall
with
more
right
to
the
title
perhaps
than
i
he
thought
unhappily
and
he
felt
as
if
icy
fingers
stroked
the
back
of
his
neck
when
he
thought
how
much
one
of
those
three
knights
back
there
stood
to
gain
by
his
death
his
little
troop
raised
no
dust
the
road
was
damp
and
covered
with
puddles
from
yesterday
rain
thank
god
it
had
not
rained
hard
enough
to
turn
the
road
into
mud
as
it
was
the
weather
made
his
gloomier
than
it
need
have
been
the
empty
fields
littered
with
yellow
stubble
lay
flat
under
the
vast
gray
bowl
of
a
cloudy
november
sky
the
only
feature
in
that
landscape
was
a
darker
gray
the
bulk
of
château
gobignon
with
its
round
towers
rising
on
its
great
solitary
hill
the
road
they
traveled
ran
back
to
it
as
straight
as
if
it
had
been
drawn
with
a
mason
rule
should
stop
this
enterprise
simon
thought
should
turn
back
before
it
is
too
the
longer
they
were
on
the
road
the
harder
it
would
be
to
declare
suddenly
that
gobignon
was
going
to
war
in
italy
to
tell
his
barons
and
knights
to
return
to
their
homes
and
hang
up
their
arms
if
he
did
so
at
this
moment
he
would
provoke
great
anger
in
these
men
of
his
own
household
today
and
tomorrow
great
barons
would
be
joining
him
mature
men
his
vassals
but
men
of
weight
and
power
in
their
own
right
their
scorn
at
his
change
of
heart
would
be
almost
unbearable
but
did
he
want
to
be
another
amalric
de
gobignon
leading
the
flower
of
his
domain
manhood
hundreds
of
knights
and
thousands
of
to
war
with
only
a
handful
coming
back
if
this
was
a
bad
war
god
might
well
punish
charles
with
defeat
and
simon
would
share
not
in
the
glory
as
charles
had
promised
him
but
in
disaster
and
death
i
am
not
rightfully
the
count
de
he
knew
though
these
men
did
not
that
he
had
no
right
to
call
them
out
to
war
if
simon
de
gobignon
a
bastard
and
an
impostor
led
this
army
to
its
destruction
what
name
was
there
for
such
a
crime
the
voice
of
valery
de
pirenne
simon
new
equerry
broke
in
on
tormented
thoughts
i
am
not
sorry
to
be
leaving
home
this
time
of
year
what
better
place
to
spend
the
winter
than
sunny
italy
have
already
caused
the
death
of
this
young
man
brother
will
i
kill
valery
too
it
rains
much
in
italy
in
january
said
thierry
now
sire
thierry
having
been
knighted
by
simon
at
the
beginning
of
november
on
the
feast
of
all
saints
his
tone
was
lofty
with
experience
bad
weather
for
war
said
henri
de
puys
whose
experience
was
ten
times
thierry
or
simon
for
that
matter
but
the
rains
should
be
over
by
the
time
we
reach
that
infidel
manfred
kingdom
look
there
said
thierry
more
knights
coming
to
meet
us
simon
saw
a
line
of
about
a
dozen
men
on
horseback
three
wagons
and
a
straggling
column
of
men
on
foot
with
spears
over
their
shoulders
the
oncoming
knights
and
men
were
tiny
in
the
distance
marching
along
a
road
that
would
meet
simon
route
god
now
it
will
be
harder
to
turn
them
that
will
be
the
party
from
château
la
durie
thierry
said
pointing
to
the
horizon
where
the
four
towers
of
a
small
castle
were
just
barely
visible
a
distant
bell
was
ringing
out
the
noon
hour
as
simon
troop
met
those
from
la
durie
all
of
the
new
knights
wore
red
crosses
on
their
tunics
sire
antoine
de
la
durie
was
a
stout
man
about
de
puys
age
with
a
huge
mustache
called
an
algernon
whose
ends
grew
into
his
sideburns
simon
and
de
la
durie
brought
their
horses
together
and
embraced
the
knight
smelled
like
a
barn
how
was
your
harvest
sire
antoine
large
white
teeth
flashed
under
the
algernon
ample
monseigneur
but
not
so
ample
i
trust
as
what
we
shall
gather
in
sicily
they
all
wanted
this
so
much
how
his
chief
barons
had
cheered
and
roared
and
stamped
when
he
announced
this
war
to
them
at
his
midsummer
eve
feast
in
the
great
hall
at
château
gobignon
it
was
at
that
very
moment
when
he
had
seen
the
ferocious
eagerness
of
his
barons
for
war
that
he
had
begun
again
to
doubt
antoine
de
la
durie
gestured
with
a
callused
bare
hand
to
three
young
men
on
horseback
whose
russet
cloaks
were
patched
but
whose
longswords
proclaimed
their
knighthood
they
grinned
shyly
at
simon
these
are
the
pilchard
brothers
monseigneur
they
are
not
gobignon
vassals
but
they
are
madame
de
la
durie
cousin
sons
and
i
vouch
for
them
they
beg
to
go
crusading
under
your
leadership
my
leadership
god
help
them
you
are
right
welcome
messires
when
we
stop
for
the
night
see
my
clerk
friar
amos
and
have
him
add
your
names
to
our
roll
the
young
men
dismounted
rushed
to
him
and
kissed
his
hands
why
did
he
not
send
them
away
send
all
these
knights
away
tell
them
there
would
be
no
war
in
italy
because
he
was
afraid
of
his
own
barons
and
knights
the
men
he
was
supposed
to
lead
because
he
felt
he
had
set
something
in
motion
that
could
not
be
stopped
like
one
of
those
horrendous
avalanches
in
the
alps
if
they
were
to
keep
going
he
must
without
mishap
cover
ten
leagues
a
day
to
reach
rome
by
february
he
must
study
again
the
maps
valery
was
carrying
in
his
saddlebags
especially
the
one
he
had
just
received
along
with
a
letter
from
count
charles
king
charles
the
infidel
manfred
charles
had
written
had
stirred
up
the
ghibellino
cities
of
northern
italy
they
were
lying
in
wait
for
allies
of
anjou
who
might
come
down
from
france
or
the
holy
roman
empire
simon
must
not
waste
troops
fighting
the
sienese
or
florentine
militia
so
he
should
enter
italy
by
way
of
provence
and
liguria
then
cut
across
eastward
to
ravenna
and
thence
down
to
spoleto
and
viterbo
and
finally
to
rome
the
roundabout
route
would
take
longer
but
charles
would
expect
simon
in
rome
by
the
first
of
february
charles
intended
to
march
against
manfred
at
the
beginning
of
april
two
months
to
reach
provence
march
along
the
ligurian
coast
perhaps
as
far
as
genoa
which
was
safely
guelfo
and
then
pick
his
way
around
the
nests
of
northern
ghibellini
to
rome
it
could
be
done
but
only
if
his
army
met
with
no
unexpected
obstacles
a
ghibellino
army
for
instance
or
a
bad
winter
storm
and
then
beyond
rome
what
would
they
find
once
they
were
there
at
least
he
would
not
have
to
make
the
decisions
that
determined
the
fate
of
these
men
the
responsibility
and
the
blame
if
they
failed
would
be
charles
greatest
war
since
you
were
a
charles
had
promised
and
none
of
the
gobignon
men
would
ever
know
that
they
were
fighting
because
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
woman
named
sophia
if
that
was
truly
her
name
and
she
had
let
him
taste
her
love
and
then
had
disappeared
he
remembered
a
trouvere
at
a
feast
singing
of
how
the
greeks
went
to
war
because
helen
wife
of
one
of
their
kings
ran
off
with
paris
prince
of
troy
but
that
was
just
a
story
sophia
her
face
and
form
arose
in
his
memory
and
there
was
a
strange
happiness
mixed
with
the
pain
as
if
he
were
glad
of
his
suffering
he
had
heard
songs
about
the
sweet
pain
of
love
but
he
had
never
before
now
understood
them
and
even
now
he
could
not
think
of
sophia
as
an
enemy
his
heartbeat
quickened
at
the
thought
that
there
was
a
chance
very
small
but
still
a
chance
that
sophia
might
truly
be
someone
he
could
love
and
that
he
could
free
her
from
whatever
entanglement
had
dragged
her
into
power
by
the
end
of
the
day
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
around
him
was
no
longer
a
drumming
but
a
thundering
and
all
around
and
above
him
was
a
fluttering
of
banners
each
of
the
larger
contingents
that
joined
him
had
brought
the
standard
of
its
seigneur
the
road
south
was
climbing
into
forested
hills
at
the
crest
of
the
first
hill
simon
tugged
on
the
reins
to
slow
his
palfrey
and
turned
to
look
back
in
the
fading
light
of
the
overcast
day
château
gobignon
was
a
violet
outcropping
on
the
flat
horizon
its
towers
indistinct
this
would
be
his
last
sight
of
it
perhaps
for
years
and
tomorrow
he
would
cross
the
boundary
of
his
domain
that
was
a
point
past
which
there
was
no
return
once
the
host
was
assembled
once
they
had
crossed
the
gobignon
border
it
would
not
matter
what
he
told
them
if
he
refused
to
lead
them
they
would
find
another
leader
he
saw
two
more
banners
rising
above
the
crest
of
a
bare
ridge
to
the
west
then
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
men
then
the
horses
they
rode
they
waved
and
halloed
more
followed
them
and
still
more
simon
met
the
newcomers
by
a
stream
that
trickled
through
a
small
valley
lined
with
birch
trees
seigneur
claudius
de
marion
the
leader
of
the
large
new
party
lifted
his
square
chin
as
he
reached
over
and
clapped
simon
heartily
on
the
shoulder
the
valley
widens
out
up
ahead
he
said
i
propose
that
we
camp
there
the
forest
beyond
is
thick
and
not
a
good
place
to
ride
through
at
night
and
monseigneur
to
be
frank
i
do
not
want
to
send
my
daughter
home
after
dark
i
will
be
quite
safe
father
if
monseigneur
the
count
wishes
to
press
on
for
the
night
the
young
woman
riding
a
tall
gray
and
white
stallion
beside
claudius
de
marion
had
humorous
blue
eyes
and
a
wide
mouth
her
upper
lip
protruded
slightly
an
irregularity
simon
thought
quite
pretty
in
her
she
had
not
inherited
her
father
nose
which
was
shaped
like
an
axe
blade
hers
was
small
and
turned
up
at
the
end
her
single
braid
which
circled
round
from
under
her
blue
hood
and
hung
down
between
her
high
breasts
seemed
to
glow
in
the
gathering
dusk
simon
remembered
dancing
in
a
ring
that
included
her
at
last
eve
feast
she
had
worn
a
woven
wreath
of
white
daisies
in
her
hair
barbara
insisted
on
accompanying
me
to
our
meeting
said
de
marion
with
an
indulgent
grin
i
could
not
persuade
her
to
bid
me
farewell
from
our
castle
barbara
smile
was
wide
and
frank
like
her
father
in
truth
monseigneur
i
had
to
see
all
the
knights
and
men
you
have
gathered
i
knew
it
would
be
a
brave
sight
such
as
i
have
never
seen
the
like
of
god
grant
you
a
glorious
victory
will
you
take
wine
she
held
up
an
oval
wineskin
and
at
simon
nod
and
murmur
of
thanks
she
worked
her
horse
over
to
his
with
a
click
of
her
tongue
and
a
pat
on
the
neck
she
rode
like
one
born
to
it
thought
simon
which
she
was
she
squirted
the
wine
into
his
open
mouth
it
was
red
and
strong
and
it
lit
a
welcome
little
fire
in
his
belly
as
they
rode
deeper
into
the
valley
simon
asked
himself
where
had
barbara
de
marion
been
when
he
had
been
earnestly
searching
for
a
wife
she
had
been
a
child
and
his
eyes
had
passed
right
over
her
how
different
his
life
might
have
been
if
she
had
been
a
little
older
two
years
ago
seigneur
claudius
was
one
of
his
chief
vassals
and
a
good
friend
and
would
doubtless
have
had
no
objection
to
a
marriage
simon
might
never
have
gone
to
italy
but
there
was
room
in
this
heart
for
only
one
love
and
there
was
only
one
course
his
life
could
take
now
somehow
with
the
sight
of
this
maiden
and
the
realization
that
he
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
once
but
never
could
now
a
door
closed
in
simon
mind
his
destiny
lay
in
italy
he
could
no
more
forget
sophia
and
return
to
château
gobignon
like
a
snail
crawling
into
its
shell
than
he
could
spit
himself
on
his
own
sword
as
for
these
men
they
were
going
to
italy
for
their
own
gain
not
to
help
simon
find
sophia
nor
yet
to
help
charles
become
king
of
sicily
or
even
to
protect
the
pope
from
his
hohenstaufen
enemies
he
had
not
had
to
appeal
to
their
feudal
obligations
in
summoning
them
to
war
as
count
charles
had
predicted
they
all
to
come
all
they
cared
about
was
a
chance
for
riches
and
land
and
glory
after
years
of
doing
nothing
but
managing
their
domains
they
marched
of
their
own
free
will
he
only
pointed
the
way
he
remembered
something
roland
had
said
to
him
you
have
made
your
choice
put
your
whole
heart
and
soul
into
it
never
divide
which
simon
thought
was
exactly
why
even
though
he
would
pass
near
nicolette
and
roland
home
in
provence
he
would
not
visit
them
he
knew
well
their
feelings
about
crusades
and
he
could
be
quite
sure
of
the
loathing
with
which
they
would
view
this
war
roland
had
even
spent
a
good
part
of
his
youth
at
the
court
of
emperor
frederic
father
no
he
had
enough
doubts
of
his
own
without
letting
his
parents
add
more
even
so
from
his
belt
hung
roland
gift
to
him
the
jeweled
damascus
scimitar
he
did
not
like
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
was
superstitious
but
with
this
scimitar
roland
had
gotten
out
of
egypt
alive
in
the
face
of
the
most
terrible
dangers
somehow
simon
saw
the
scimitar
as
a
talisman
that
might
also
get
him
through
this
war
he
glanced
over
at
the
beautiful
barbara
de
marion
and
felt
a
rush
of
gratitude
knowing
that
lovely
as
she
was
she
could
never
make
him
forget
sophia
had
helped
him
make
his
decision
lxvi
it
has
been
four
years
since
i
mounted
a
horse
and
drew
my
bow
in
battle
said
john
chagan
with
a
grin
a
man
grows
old
if
he
does
not
fight
rachel
paused
in
her
work
of
setting
up
their
tent
for
the
night
to
stare
at
him
wondering
if
he
knew
how
unready
for
fighting
he
looked
the
pouches
under
his
eyes
were
as
prominent
as
his
cheekbones
and
the
cheekbones
themselves
were
with
tiny
red
lines
it
had
been
nearly
a
month
since
he
had
taken
his
pleasure
with
her
in
bed
she
was
glad
enough
of
that
but
she
felt
sorry
for
him
even
knowing
that
his
death
in
battle
would
free
her
the
way
his
hands
trembled
he
would
be
lucky
to
get
an
arrow
nocked
much
less
shoot
it
at
an
enemy
the
tent
flap
was
pushed
aside
and
a
venetian
crossbowman
backed
in
holding
one
end
of
rachel
traveling
chest
another
man
followed
at
the
other
end
what
have
you
got
in
here
marble
blocks
the
first
archer
grumbled
as
he
set
the
box
down
on
the
carpeted
tent
floor
beside
the
bed
my
helmet
and
sword
and
coat
of
mail
said
rachel
with
a
smile
i
would
not
want
to
miss
the
battle
fear
whispered
to
her
that
the
armed
men
who
traveled
with
the
tartars
must
be
aware
that
she
had
valuables
in
that
chest
if
any
of
them
ever
got
an
opportunity
they
would
not
hesitate
to
steal
it
from
her
and
stab
her
to
death
to
get
at
it
if
they
had
to
she
hated
carrying
the
heavy
box
everywhere
but
even
if
she
could
have
found
a
safe
place
for
it
in
rome
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
she
could
ever
get
back
there
to
claim
it
the
chest
held
her
prisoner
as
much
as
john
did
she
had
thought
that
while
she
and
john
traveled
with
charles
army
she
might
be
able
to
slip
away
perhaps
if
there
was
a
battle
she
might
escape
in
the
confusion
but
she
could
not
do
it
alone
not
if
she
wanted
to
take
the
chest
you
can
take
my
place
if
you
are
so
eager
the
second
venetian
laughed
i
seen
battles
enough
where
are
we
she
asked
icerna
still
in
papal
territory
where
are
we
going
she
heard
a
movement
as
she
asked
the
question
and
looked
over
at
john
he
was
pouring
himself
a
goblet
of
red
wine
while
eyeing
rachel
and
the
venetians
distrustfully
he
had
learned
no
italian
and
perhaps
he
thought
she
was
flirting
with
the
two
archers
we
are
coming
to
a
town
called
benevento
right
on
the
hohenstaufen
border
supposed
to
be
a
papal
city
but
you
never
know
border
cities
usually
give
their
support
to
whoever
is
closer
to
them
with
the
bigger
army
the
rumor
is
that
whether
the
town
is
guelfo
or
ghibellino
king
charles
will
let
the
troops
have
their
way
with
benevento
and
high
time
how
is
a
man
to
live
on
the
miserable
wages
our
king
doles
out
to
us
enough
of
your
damned
complaining
a
deep
voice
boomed
the
flap
of
the
tent
flew
open
letting
in
a
blast
of
chill
air
and
cardinal
de
verceuil
strode
in
terror
raced
through
rachel
she
quickly
dropped
a
quilted
blanket
over
the
chest
containing
her
treasure
de
verceuil
threw
back
the
hood
of
his
heavy
woolen
cloak
and
though
his
words
had
been
for
the
venetian
archers
glared
at
rachel
accusingly
she
felt
herself
trembling
he
was
dressed
in
bright
red
but
like
a
soldier
not
like
a
man
of
the
church
he
wore
a
heavy
leather
vest
over
his
scarlet
tunic
and
black
leather
boots
help
me
what
is
he
going
to
do
to
me
sordello
the
capitano
of
the
tartars
guards
followed
the
cardinal
into
the
tent
his
lopsided
grin
was
as
frightening
as
the
angry
stare
his
eyes
narrowed
and
rachel
felt
her
face
burn
as
he
looked
her
up
and
down
out
sordello
snapped
at
the
two
venetian
crossbowmen
after
they
were
gone
the
tent
flap
opened
still
another
time
and
friar
mathieu
hobbled
in
leaning
on
his
walking
stick
we
do
not
need
you
de
verceuil
growled
in
his
italian
john
needs
me
said
friar
mathieu
to
translate
for
him
and
i
think
rachel
needs
me
too
stupid
savage
should
have
learned
italian
by
now
said
sordello
you
are
very
brave
capitano
insulting
him
in
a
language
he
does
not
thought
rachel
contemptuously
de
verceuil
glowered
at
friar
mathieu
you
can
not
protect
her
protect
me
from
what
rachel
voice
sounded
in
her
own
ears
like
a
scream
and
her
heart
was
pounding
against
the
walls
of
her
chest
john
can
protect
her
said
friar
mathieu
if
he
understands
what
is
happening
he
looked
full
into
rachel
face
and
there
was
a
warning
in
his
old
blue
eyes
she
was
almost
frantic
with
fear
now
she
had
not
been
so
frightened
since
the
day
john
and
the
rest
of
them
had
invaded
house
and
carried
her
off
what
was
friar
mathieu
trying
to
warn
her
about
what
do
you
know
of
sophia
orfali
ugolini
niece
de
verceuil
demanded
in
his
italian
mathieu
has
betrayed
me
rachel
looked
over
at
the
old
franciscan
and
saw
him
close
his
eyes
very
slowly
and
deliberately
and
open
them
again
your
mouth
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
say
to
her
she
had
to
trust
him
she
could
not
believe
he
would
say
anything
to
turn
de
verceuil
against
her
i
i
know
nothing
she
said
who
is
this
you
are
asking
about
what
happens
here
john
asked
friar
mathieu
in
the
tartar
language
why
are
the
high
priest
and
this
foot
archer
in
my
tent
i
did
not
invite
them
tell
them
i
send
them
away
friar
mathieu
started
to
answer
in
the
tartar
tongue
rachel
strained
to
hear
him
but
sordello
ugly
laughter
overrode
the
friar
voice
i
escorted
sophia
orfali
to
tilia
caballo
brothel
more
than
once
sordello
said
and
i
know
she
was
going
to
visit
because
i
overheard
her
telling
that
to
that
devil
david
of
trebizond
so
it
was
sordello
not
friar
mathieu
who
had
been
talking
to
de
verceuil
she
should
have
known
rachel
heard
friar
mathieu
now
i
am
talking
to
not
to
john
he
said
in
the
tartar
tongue
and
she
understood
that
friar
mathieu
meant
her
neither
de
verceuil
nor
sordello
understood
the
language
of
the
tartars
or
knew
that
she
knew
it
as
long
as
friar
mathieu
did
not
address
rachel
by
name
and
kept
his
eyes
on
john
who
looked
confused
it
would
appear
that
he
was
talking
to
the
tartar
and
not
to
rachel
de
verceuil
strode
over
to
the
wine
bottle
standing
on
the
low
table
by
john
bed
without
asking
permission
he
picked
it
up
and
drank
deeply
from
it
the
tartars
travel
with
the
best
wine
in
this
whole
army
he
declared
better
than
the
cheap
swill
king
charles
carries
with
him
sophia
glanced
at
john
and
saw
that
he
was
glowering
at
de
verceuil
friar
mathieu
said
in
the
tartar
tongue
sordello
went
to
the
cardinal
with
the
story
that
you
must
be
some
sort
of
agent
for
manfred
and
therefore
it
is
dangerous
for
john
to
keep
you
with
him
why
would
sordello
do
that
now
rachel
wondered
he
could
have
accused
her
anytime
in
the
past
year
she
could
not
question
friar
mathieu
though
without
giving
it
away
that
he
was
talking
to
her
did
sordello
have
some
plan
to
get
the
chest
away
from
her
and
desert
they
know
hardly
anything
about
you
friar
mathieu
said
do
not
be
afraid
admit
nothing
deny
everything
i
think
sordello
knows
more
about
ugolini
household
and
about
tilia
caballo
brothel
than
is
safe
for
him
to
admit
say
nothing
and
i
believe
they
will
frustrate
themselves
john
smiled
and
nodded
at
friar
mathieu
i
see
what
you
are
doing
he
said
in
tartar
de
verceuil
was
looming
over
her
speak
up
what
was
your
connection
with
ugolini
niece
she
ugolini
niece
even
though
she
was
standing
up
he
looked
down
on
her
from
an
enormous
height
his
deep
voice
and
great
size
terrified
her
she
said
i
know
nothing
about
any
cardinal
or
any
cardinal
niece
de
verceuil
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
his
fingers
digging
in
so
hard
she
felt
as
if
nails
were
being
driven
into
her
muscles
she
was
almost
dizzy
with
panic
you
lying
little
jewess
suddenly
rachel
felt
a
violent
shove
and
she
was
thrown
back
against
her
chest
and
sat
down
on
it
hard
she
looked
up
and
saw
that
john
was
standing
before
de
verceuil
it
was
he
who
had
pushed
them
apart
his
arms
were
spread
wide
do
not
dare
to
touch
her
again
john
shouted
in
the
tartar
tongue
he
turned
to
friar
mathieu
and
jerked
his
head
at
de
verceuil
tell
him
when
friar
mathieu
had
repeated
john
command
the
cardinal
answered
tell
messer
john
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
jewish
whore
is
an
agent
of
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
the
enemy
we
are
marching
to
destroy
she
met
with
sophia
orfali
ugolini
niece
and
ugolini
and
his
niece
have
both
fled
to
manfred
manfred
has
tried
before
now
to
harm
messer
john
and
he
could
do
it
through
this
girl
john
shrugged
and
glowered
at
de
verceuil
when
he
heard
this
foolishness
reicho
does
nothing
but
read
books
and
comfort
me
she
has
no
friends
and
no
one
comes
to
talk
with
her
except
you
go
away
de
verceuil
took
another
swallow
from
the
wine
jar
put
that
down
john
shouted
de
verceuil
did
not
need
to
have
that
translated
he
put
the
jar
down
frowning
at
john
offended
sordello
is
right
de
verceuil
said
the
man
is
a
savage
do
you
want
me
to
tell
him
so
said
friar
mathieu
de
verceuil
replied
to
this
with
a
haughty
stare
tell
him
this
he
said
tomorrow
we
march
to
benevento
king
charles
has
sent
scouts
and
spies
into
manfred
lands
and
they
have
learned
that
manfred
is
moving
in
our
direction
with
a
large
army
larger
than
ours
if
the
reports
are
to
be
believed
we
would
be
stronger
still
if
your
friend
the
pusillanimous
count
de
gobignon
were
to
put
in
an
appearance
rachel
remembered
the
count
de
gobignon
that
tall
thin
man
who
had
so
frightened
her
with
his
questions
about
madonna
sophia
everyone
was
asking
questions
about
madonna
sophia
there
was
no
doubt
that
madonna
sophia
and
her
friends
had
some
secret
rachel
had
always
known
that
though
she
did
not
want
to
know
what
the
secret
was
whatever
it
was
rachel
promised
herself
that
no
one
would
get
a
hint
of
it
from
her
count
simon
was
reported
coming
down
the
east
coast
of
italy
said
friar
mathieu
he
could
have
joined
our
army
if
king
charles
had
been
able
to
wait
for
him
in
rome
king
charles
did
not
choose
to
wait
in
rome
said
de
verceuil
oh
i
think
he
did
said
friar
mathieu
i
think
he
would
have
been
happy
to
stay
in
rome
if
his
supporters
such
as
his
marshals
and
yourself
had
not
pressed
him
to
move
southward
when
you
heard
manfred
was
on
the
march
i
did
not
know
that
you
ragged
franciscans
were
experts
on
military
strategy
said
de
verceuil
we
are
not
indeed
war
greatly
grieves
us
but
we
do
possess
common
sense
what
if
there
were
a
battle
and
manfred
won
rachel
thought
would
manfred
soldiers
kill
john
would
they
treat
her
as
one
of
the
enemy
would
they
rape
her
steal
her
treasure
she
had
always
hoped
to
escape
to
the
kingdom
of
sicily
and
now
she
was
in
the
camp
of
enemies
will
there
be
a
battle
she
asked
timidly
of
no
one
in
particular
de
verceuil
head
swung
around
toward
her
do
not
worry
about
the
battle
little
harlot
he
said
in
an
unpleasantly
syrupy
voice
yes
i
expect
we
will
be
too
busy
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
to
concern
ourselves
with
you
after
that
perhaps
we
will
have
some
ghibellino
prisoners
to
help
us
find
out
what
you
have
been
up
to
and
you
will
furnish
our
weary
troops
with
diversion
rachel
felt
as
if
her
body
had
turned
into
a
block
of
ice
was
he
saying
that
he
would
let
the
troops
have
her
that
would
kill
her
after
something
like
that
she
would
want
to
be
dead
please
she
whispered
yes
diversion
said
de
verceuil
reaching
down
to
take
her
face
between
his
hard
gloved
fingers
it
has
been
many
a
year
now
since
i
have
seen
a
jew
burn
and
when
you
go
up
in
flames
it
will
mark
a
new
beginning
for
this
sicilian
kingdom
of
heretics
jews
and
saracens
you
will
be
the
first
but
not
the
last
he
let
go
of
her
face
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
pushed
away
by
john
he
took
a
last
swallow
of
wine
and
turned
and
strode
out
of
the
tent
followed
by
sordello
who
turned
and
gave
rachel
a
last
leering
grin
is
that
a
great
man
among
your
people
john
asked
friar
mathieu
his
face
black
with
rage
among
my
people
he
would
be
sewn
into
a
leather
bag
and
thrown
into
the
nearest
river
rachel
sat
on
her
traveling
box
her
hand
pressed
between
her
breasts
to
quiet
her
pounding
heart
she
could
hardly
believe
what
she
had
heard
that
de
verceuil
wanted
to
burn
her
at
the
stake
as
an
agent
of
manfred
after
the
coming
battle
god
let
manfred
win
his
name
was
nuwaihi
and
he
was
so
young
that
his
beard
was
still
sparse
he
came
riding
with
his
two
companions
out
of
the
hills
to
the
north
and
brought
his
pony
to
a
skidding
stop
beside
daoud
he
turned
his
mount
and
they
rode
on
together
side
by
side
in
manfred
vanguard
i
saw
the
army
of
king
charles
effendi
i
and
abdul
and
said
he
said
in
arabic
gesturing
to
include
his
comrades
the
franks
are
on
the
road
that
leads
from
cassino
to
benevento
they
are
about
two
days
ride
from
here
we
hid
behind
boulders
close
to
the
road
and
we
counted
them
there
are
over
eight
hundred
mounted
warriors
and
five
thousand
men
on
foot
they
have
many
pack
animals
and
wagons
and
merchants
and
priests
and
women
following
them
just
as
our
army
does
his
breath
and
that
of
his
pony
steamed
in
the
cold
air
daoud
felt
a
prickling
sensation
rise
on
his
neck
and
spread
across
his
shoulders
two
days
ride
the
armies
could
meet
tomorrow
tomorrow
would
decide
everything
now
if
only
manfred
could
conceive
a
plan
for
outmaneuvering
charles
if
only
he
would
take
daoud
advice
he
knew
europeans
preferred
to
fight
pitched
battles
and
he
prayed
that
manfred
would
not
choose
that
way
did
you
see
a
purple
banner
with
three
gold
crowns
daoud
asked
two
weeks
ago
a
courier
from
the
ghibellini
in
northern
italy
had
brought
word
that
simon
de
gobignon
army
had
passed
through
ravenna
on
the
adriatic
coast
it
seemed
unlikely
to
daoud
that
de
gobignon
would
catch
up
with
charles
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
coming
battle
no
purple
banner
they
fly
the
white
banner
with
the
red
cross
nuwaihi
turned
his
head
to
the
left
and
spat
and
all
the
soldiers
have
red
crosses
on
their
tunics
he
spat
again
his
fierceness
pleased
daoud
at
one
time
he
thought
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
learn
that
simon
de
gobignon
was
not
with
charles
army
he
would
have
longed
to
meet
simon
on
the
field
and
fight
and
kill
him
but
now
he
understood
that
he
had
hated
simon
because
simon
resembled
the
christian
david
that
he
might
have
been
it
did
not
matter
to
him
that
he
would
not
meet
the
french
count
again
instead
he
could
feel
relieved
that
charles
would
not
have
simon
knights
and
men
as
part
of
his
army
nuwaihi
went
on
their
count
charles
he
who
would
be
king
was
at
the
head
of
the
column
i
knew
him
because
he
wears
a
crown
on
his
helmet
his
banner
is
red
with
a
black
lion
rearing
up
on
its
hind
legs
daoud
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
manfred
not
far
behind
him
on
a
white
horse
with
a
black
streak
running
from
forehead
to
nose
the
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
in
a
cloak
the
color
of
springtime
leaves
was
the
center
of
a
mounted
group
of
his
favorite
courtiers
one
strummed
a
lute
and
they
were
singing
together
in
latin
brave
spectacle
manfred
rides
into
battle
singing
latin
a
mameluke
army
on
its
way
to
war
would
have
mullahs
praying
for
victory
and
a
mounted
band
playing
martial
music
on
kettledrums
trumpets
and
hautboys
the
young
blond
men
around
manfred
daoud
knew
were
nimble
dancers
witty
talkers
skilled
musicians
and
expert
falconers
how
well
they
could
fight
he
had
yet
to
see
manfred
was
the
oldest
of
them
but
right
now
he
looked
as
young
as
the
others
he
had
on
no
visible
armor
though
daoud
knew
he
regularly
wore
a
mail
vest
under
his
lime
tunic
behind
manfred
all
on
glossy
palfreys
and
wearing
mail
shirts
rode
his
swabian
knights
lorenzo
celino
and
erhard
barth
in
the
first
rank
the
swabians
grandfathers
had
come
to
sicily
to
serve
the
hohenstaufens
and
they
still
spoke
german
among
themselves
like
their
king
they
wore
no
helmets
but
most
of
them
had
hoods
drawn
tight
around
their
heads
to
protect
them
from
the
february
wind
above
them
fluttered
the
yellow
hohenstaufen
banner
with
its
black
eagle
the
column
of
knights
four
abreast
stretched
westward
down
this
main
road
the
lines
of
helmets
and
pennoned
lances
disappeared
over
the
crest
of
a
pass
cutting
through
the
bleak
mountain
range
that
formed
the
rocky
spine
of
italy
snow
outlined
the
crevices
in
the
rocks
that
towered
above
the
army
of
sicily
manfred
host
moved
at
a
leisurely
rate
daoud
found
typically
european
the
march
west
after
they
had
assembled
at
lucera
had
taken
two
weeks
the
mounted
warriors
were
held
to
the
pace
of
the
foot
soldiers
twice
the
army
had
been
struck
by
sleet
storms
that
changed
the
road
into
a
river
of
mud
rather
than
press
on
as
baibars
would
have
manfred
had
ordered
his
army
to
halt
and
seek
shelter
in
hillside
forests
in
some
of
the
valleys
the
army
had
been
able
to
spread
out
and
march
briskly
over
frozen
fields
and
pastures
but
then
along
a
mountainside
or
through
a
pass
the
road
would
close
down
again
and
the
flow
of
troops
would
slow
to
a
trickle
daoud
turned
back
to
nuwaihi
were
you
close
enough
to
the
road
to
see
the
tartars
i
told
you
of
two
small
brown
men
with
slanted
eyes
yes
effendi
they
were
riding
near
the
head
of
the
franks
just
as
you
told
me
they
had
eight
mounted
men
wearing
red
cloaks
guarding
them
and
before
and
after
them
marched
many
men
carrying
crossbows
people
are
such
masters
of
war
how
they
will
laugh
at
the
idiotic
way
christians
fight
each
daoud
wondered
whether
the
enemy
army
were
mostly
frenchmen
or
as
mixed
a
host
as
manfred
troops
were
manfred
thousand
knights
and
four
thousand
included
swabians
south
italians
sicilians
and
muslims
only
instead
of
three
scouts
we
had
three
hundred
men
lying
in
ambush
along
that
road
we
could
have
broken
charles
attack
and
perhaps
killed
him
and
the
tartars
then
and
daoud
thanked
nuwaihi
abdul
and
said
and
sent
them
to
join
the
sons
of
the
falcon
riding
today
as
the
rear
guard
he
rode
back
to
manfred
hoping
he
could
persuade
the
king
and
his
commanders
to
use
wisely
the
great
army
they
had
assembled
soon
manfred
erhard
barth
several
of
manfred
german
and
italian
commanders
lorenzo
and
daoud
were
dismounted
and
gathered
in
a
field
beside
the
line
of
march
manfred
orderly
had
brought
a
map
of
the
region
and
spread
it
out
on
the
ground
weighting
the
edges
with
rocks
as
manfred
crouched
over
the
map
his
silver
star
with
its
ruby
center
hung
over
a
town
represented
on
the
map
by
an
archway
and
a
church
surrounded
by
a
wall
the
drawing
was
marked
with
the
latin
name
beneventum
we
can
be
in
benevento
by
nightfall
said
barth
and
anjou
army
will
probably
arrive
at
the
same
time
there
is
but
one
road
they
can
follow
he
pointed
to
a
brown
line
that
ran
down
from
a
large
oval
at
the
top
of
the
map
drawn
around
a
collection
of
buildings
and
marked
roma
between
rome
and
benevento
was
a
series
of
towns
each
indicated
by
a
drawing
of
one
or
two
buildings
surrounded
by
walls
mountains
were
shown
as
rows
of
sharp
little
points
benevento
is
a
guelfo
town
said
manfred
and
deserves
to
have
us
move
in
on
it
and
quarter
our
troops
there
the
town
is
at
the
end
of
a
long
valley
that
runs
north
to
south
the
opening
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
is
a
narrow
pass
anjou
army
must
come
through
that
pass
they
will
find
it
easier
to
get
into
the
valley
than
to
get
out
because
we
will
be
waiting
for
them
daoud
felt
a
surge
of
exasperation
and
quickly
pushed
it
back
down
anger
would
not
help
him
waiting
for
them
he
said
if
we
are
making
war
we
do
not
to
meet
them
manfred
frowned
if
we
drive
them
up
against
the
north
end
of
the
valley
we
will
have
them
trapped
manfred
smashed
his
fist
into
his
palm
there
will
be
nowhere
for
them
to
escape
to
is
getting
tired
of
my
giving
advice
that
contradicts
the
way
he
thinks
things
should
be
done
after
all
he
did
win
battles
before
i
came
but
to
simply
meet
charles
army
like
two
bulls
butting
heads
seemed
lunacy
to
daoud
such
a
battle
will
be
bad
for
both
sides
he
said
we
will
butcher
each
other
i
should
have
spent
less
time
training
my
men
and
more
trying
to
teach
we
do
outnumber
them
said
manfred
testily
and
if
every
one
of
their
men
kills
one
of
ours
and
every
one
of
our
men
kills
one
of
theirs
there
should
be
a
few
of
our
men
left
at
the
end
of
the
battle
do
you
call
that
a
victory
show
some
respect
for
your
king
a
neapolitan
officer
snapped
no
be
still
signore
pasca
manfred
said
to
the
neapolitan
i
want
to
hear
emir
daoud
out
what
can
we
do
except
meet
them
and
fight
them
daoud
remembered
how
he
had
wished
that
instead
of
scouts
he
had
set
men
to
ambush
the
franks
he
studied
the
map
let
us
send
men
into
the
mountains
around
here
and
here
he
ran
his
finger
over
the
angular
shapes
the
mapmaker
had
drawn
around
benevento
then
when
charles
army
is
in
the
valley
we
will
fall
upon
it
from
both
sides
and
destroy
it
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
the
younger
swabian
officers
were
looking
at
him
with
mingled
horror
and
disgust
manfred
stared
at
the
map
with
embarrassed
intensity
erhard
barth
broke
the
silence
such
an
ambush
would
not
be
according
to
the
customs
of
chivalry
herr
daoud
even
if
we
were
to
win
the
battle
in
such
a
fashion
the
victory
would
bring
us
so
much
infamy
that
it
would
be
better
had
we
lost
we
are
not
in
outremer
thank
god
said
a
swabian
with
a
long
scar
on
his
cheek
and
we
are
not
saracens
said
the
one
called
pasca
most
of
us
in
other
words
our
noble
commanders
would
refuse
to
fight
said
lorenzo
glaring
angrily
at
the
other
officers
how
would
baibars
deal
with
these
men
daoud
wondered
he
might
cut
off
a
head
or
two
and
lavish
gold
and
jewels
and
robes
of
honor
on
the
rest
but
daoud
had
placed
himself
under
manfred
orders
and
manfred
army
was
not
disciplined
as
islamic
armies
were
european
armies
were
made
up
of
bands
of
warriors
led
by
men
who
might
or
might
not
choose
to
take
orders
from
their
overlord
you
can
not
turn
my
men
into
saracens
said
manfred
firmly
even
my
saracens
fight
like
europeans
because
they
have
lived
in
sicily
for
generations
you
have
trained
two
hundred
men
in
your
mameluke
methods
of
fighting
and
i
have
seen
that
they
are
a
brilliant
unit
but
you
would
need
many
years
to
teach
your
ways
to
thousands
of
knights
and
men
and
i
must
give
my
germans
and
italians
a
plan
that
will
be
acceptable
to
them
erhard
barth
mouth
drew
down
in
an
apologetic
grimace
it
is
the
way
we
are
used
to
fighting
herr
daoud
it
was
infuriating
daoud
felt
rage
burst
in
him
like
greek
fire
with
a
silent
inward
struggle
he
brought
it
under
control
for
good
or
ill
his
destiny
was
bound
to
manfred
when
the
conference
ended
daoud
horse
picked
its
way
among
the
shrubs
and
rocks
beside
the
road
retracing
the
line
of
march
back
to
the
supply
caravan
daoud
felt
a
powerful
need
to
spend
a
few
moments
with
sophia
she
had
insisted
on
coming
with
him
he
had
wanted
her
to
stay
out
of
danger
now
tormented
by
misgivings
about
the
coming
battle
he
feared
for
her
even
more
but
nothing
now
could
spare
them
from
tomorrow
peril
and
it
lifted
his
heart
to
know
that
she
was
here
lxvii
daoud
woke
to
a
discreet
scratching
on
the
curtains
of
his
bed
somewhere
in
the
street
a
drum
was
beating
sounding
farther
then
nearer
again
as
the
drummer
marched
up
and
down
the
streets
of
benevento
waking
the
fighting
men
quartered
there
i
am
awake
he
rasped
may
god
look
with
favor
on
your
deeds
this
day
my
lord
came
the
voice
of
his
orderly
husain
through
the
heavy
curtains
sophia
back
was
warm
against
his
chest
his
left
arm
on
which
she
had
been
sleeping
was
numb
she
wriggled
her
shoulders
and
then
turned
over
to
face
him
he
freed
his
arm
and
rubbed
his
face
against
hers
his
beard
brushing
her
cheek
she
wrapped
one
arm
around
him
and
twined
her
legs
around
one
of
his
her
free
hand
moved
down
fondling
him
his
hands
glided
over
her
body
trying
to
memorize
the
feel
of
her
she
murmured
with
pleasure
into
his
ear
she
opened
her
eyes
suddenly
will
it
be
bad
for
you
to
do
this
with
me
what
to
do
you
mean
bad
deprive
you
of
strength
for
the
battle
he
chuckled
softly
if
you
made
me
stop
now
i
would
be
filled
with
such
a
rage
that
i
would
slay
all
of
charles
army
her
hand
stopped
pleasuring
him
that
would
be
good
then
we
must
stop
no
he
said
i
would
rather
go
into
battle
with
a
beautiful
memory
and
a
clear
head
as
for
my
strength
god
will
restore
it
moments
after
i
spend
it
he
always
has
i
assure
you
then
let
us
not
wait
she
pulled
him
over
on
top
of
her
and
accepted
him
into
herself
tightening
around
him
a
flood
of
breathless
greek
endearments
filled
his
ear
he
had
never
been
with
a
woman
who
cried
out
as
sophia
did
during
the
act
of
love
try
as
she
might
to
muffle
her
sounds
she
was
certain
in
the
final
surge
to
lose
control
he
was
sure
manfred
other
officers
quartered
in
this
house
must
hear
her
well
let
them
hear
her
and
envy
him
she
let
him
rest
upon
her
happily
released
until
his
body
withdrew
itself
from
her
a
shadow
crossed
his
mind
may
have
been
the
last
time
for
they
lay
side
by
side
a
faint
light
penetrated
the
bed
curtains
from
somewhere
in
their
room
and
by
that
light
he
could
see
her
smiling
he
smiled
back
but
his
body
was
growing
tense
fear
of
what
he
would
face
in
the
hours
to
come
was
building
inside
him
the
face
he
loved
the
warmth
of
her
body
so
close
to
his
made
him
wish
he
need
never
leave
this
bed
his
arms
and
legs
felt
heavy
rebellious
if
he
commanded
them
to
move
away
from
her
they
would
not
truth
i
would
have
to
be
mad
to
want
to
go
out
and
butcher
infidels
rather
than
stay
here
with
but
he
could
not
stay
with
her
today
would
decide
everything
he
forced
his
reluctant
limbs
to
push
him
away
from
her
she
did
not
try
to
hold
him
outside
the
heavy
bed
curtains
the
air
in
the
room
felt
cold
as
death
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
felt
a
sickening
void
of
apprehension
in
his
belly
as
sheikh
saadi
had
taught
him
he
faced
his
fear
he
was
terrified
of
death
and
defeat
probably
there
had
never
been
a
warrior
anywhere
in
the
world
who
had
not
felt
this
way
on
the
morning
of
a
battle
probably
the
prophet
himself
before
battle
had
feared
for
himself
and
for
those
he
loved
can
not
control
today
outcome
for
myself
or
for
the
men
i
fight
beside
but
i
can
dedicate
my
mind
and
heart
and
will
and
limbs
to
god
i
can
fight
for
him
to
the
uttermost
of
my
strength
passive
toward
god
active
toward
the
naked
he
walked
to
the
door
leading
to
the
balcony
and
pushed
it
partway
open
a
draft
of
even
chillier
air
made
his
skin
prickle
and
fluttered
the
flame
of
the
candle
husain
had
lit
when
he
woke
them
the
sky
was
still
black
and
full
of
stars
dawn
was
a
long
way
off
he
was
on
the
third
story
of
this
house
in
benevento
and
could
see
over
the
roofs
of
most
of
the
surrounding
houses
men
hurried
through
the
streets
swinging
lanterns
the
drum
was
still
beating
a
rapid
tattoo
in
the
near
distance
joined
now
by
horses
hooves
clattering
on
the
cobblestones
here
and
there
a
candle
glowed
behind
shutters
far
away
probably
in
the
main
camp
of
manfred
army
north
of
town
a
trumpet
called
he
shivered
and
closed
the
shutter
against
the
winter
wind
sophia
had
pushed
the
bed
curtains
aside
and
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
a
blanket
wrapped
around
her
watching
him
on
the
bedroom
table
husain
had
carefully
laid
out
a
pitcher
and
basin
and
daoud
underclothes
daoud
took
the
tawidh
by
its
thong
and
tied
it
around
his
neck
next
he
picked
up
the
silver
locket
and
turned
the
little
screw
that
opened
it
the
magic
was
still
working
but
when
he
looked
into
the
locket
he
saw
the
same
face
that
was
looking
at
him
from
across
the
room
a
feeling
of
happy
relief
filled
him
driving
out
the
foreboding
that
had
darkened
his
mind
earlier
in
bed
with
sophia
he
was
sure
now
that
whatever
connection
the
locket
had
with
blossoming
reed
was
lost
love
had
changed
the
image
he
had
been
testing
it
ever
since
he
arrived
at
lucera
and
it
always
showed
him
sophia
face
he
could
hope
that
whatever
spell
blossoming
reed
had
placed
upon
it
when
she
warned
him
love
will
destroy
both
her
and
was
now
broken
he
closed
the
locket
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
he
had
said
in
his
heart
to
blossoming
reed
sometime
during
these
years
in
the
land
of
the
infidel
he
had
loved
blossoming
reed
but
he
had
never
known
love
in
all
its
fullness
and
completion
until
sophia
and
knowing
that
he
had
violated
the
one
commandment
blossoming
reed
had
laid
upon
him
and
carrying
her
threat
in
the
back
of
his
mind
his
love
for
her
had
withered
she
was
still
as
vivid
in
his
mind
eye
as
she
had
been
in
the
locket
before
sophia
supplanted
her
but
his
feeling
for
her
now
was
one
of
sad
renunciation
whether
or
not
he
survived
this
war
they
must
be
forever
parted
he
filled
the
earthenware
basin
with
water
from
the
wooden
pitcher
and
began
a
ritual
washing
first
his
hands
then
his
face
then
forearms
from
wrists
to
elbows
then
his
feet
up
to
the
ankles
how
can
you
stand
the
cold
sophia
said
daoud
shrugged
i
have
to
he
did
not
want
to
talk
now
he
wanted
to
empty
his
mind
for
prayer
he
tied
the
drawstring
of
his
braies
then
he
pulled
on
red
silk
trousers
flaring
below
the
knee
and
tight
at
the
ankles
and
drew
a
cotton
shirt
over
his
head
he
went
to
the
balcony
again
to
check
his
directions
there
was
venus
that
was
east
then
he
took
a
small
carpet
out
of
his
traveling
chest
and
laid
it
over
the
rug
on
the
bedroom
floor
he
oriented
the
prayer
carpet
toward
the
southeast
and
stood
at
the
end
of
it
he
began
the
salat
bringing
his
hands
up
to
the
sides
of
his
head
and
saying
allahu
akbar
god
is
great
he
repeated
his
prayers
the
bowing
the
kneeling
the
prostrations
with
great
care
and
full
attention
with
his
forehead
pressed
to
the
rug
he
submitted
himself
and
this
day
utterly
to
the
will
of
god
finished
he
looked
over
at
sophia
she
was
still
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
watching
him
silently
he
looked
long
at
her
drinking
her
in
it
weighed
heavily
on
his
heart
that
he
had
to
leave
her
and
even
more
heavily
that
she
would
be
terribly
frightened
for
him
until
he
came
back
as
he
feared
for
her
god
cherisher
of
worlds
protect
he
began
to
dress
for
battle
husain
had
spread
out
his
armor
and
weapons
on
top
of
his
traveling
chest
daoud
breastplate
was
made
of
many
rectangular
pieces
of
steel
laced
together
with
leather
thongs
and
overlapping
each
other
two
larger
plates
side
by
side
were
attached
over
his
heart
inlaid
with
the
spiraling
gold
design
that
marked
him
a
member
of
the
halkha
the
sultan
personal
guard
worked
into
the
design
were
verses
from
the
koran
on
the
left
plate
he
succeeds
who
purifies
the
soul
and
on
the
right
and
he
fails
who
corrupts
it
the
breastplate
was
divided
at
the
sides
where
it
could
be
strapped
together
baibars
himself
after
daoud
returned
to
manfred
had
arranged
for
a
bribed
genoese
sea
captain
to
smuggle
it
to
him
daoud
was
proud
of
it
and
the
men
of
the
sons
of
the
falcon
would
be
proud
to
see
their
leader
wearing
it
he
pulled
on
a
quilted
tunic
of
embroidered
red
silk
its
padding
stuffed
with
linen
then
he
dropped
the
breastplate
over
his
head
he
heard
a
movement
behind
him
and
then
felt
sophia
fastening
the
breastplate
at
his
sides
the
storehouse
of
manfred
muslim
armorers
offered
blades
of
the
finest
hindustan
steel
and
from
it
daoud
had
selected
a
saif
for
himself
it
gleamed
in
the
candlelight
as
he
drew
it
from
its
sheath
he
examined
with
pleasure
the
gold
inlay
near
the
hilt
there
was
not
a
nick
or
a
scratch
anywhere
on
the
blade
he
took
a
heavy
silk
scarf
from
the
clothing
on
the
table
and
tossed
it
in
the
air
he
held
the
blade
under
it
edge
up
the
scarf
fell
on
the
blade
and
then
dropped
to
the
floor
in
two
parts
he
sheathed
the
sword
and
buckled
it
on
he
put
on
his
bayda
his
helmet
and
wrapped
the
silk
of
his
turban
around
and
around
it
and
when
it
was
properly
tied
pinned
it
with
an
emerald
clasp
someday
you
must
do
that
slowly
for
me
so
i
can
learn
how
to
wrap
your
turban
said
sophia
i
would
like
to
do
that
for
you
a
pang
of
sorrow
for
her
struck
his
heart
as
he
realized
she
was
speaking
of
their
future
together
to
convince
herself
that
there
would
be
one
he
wished
he
could
free
her
from
fear
while
he
dressed
she
had
quietly
been
dressing
too
in
a
long
blue
gown
and
a
fiery
orange
woolen
mantle
he
looked
down
at
the
weapons
laid
out
on
the
chest
selected
a
dagger
and
stuck
it
in
his
belt
next
to
the
dagger
lay
the
scorpion
the
tiny
crossbow
assembled
with
a
box
of
darts
beside
it
surely
not
a
weapon
for
a
battle
he
thought
here
he
turned
to
sophia
and
handed
her
the
crossbow
i
know
you
have
a
dagger
but
you
can
use
this
to
protect
yourself
too
sometimes
i
coat
the
darts
with
a
drug
that
makes
a
man
unconscious
sometimes
with
deadly
poison
these
darts
are
poisoned
be
very
careful
with
them
most
people
have
never
seen
a
weapon
like
this
so
it
will
surprise
them
and
you
do
not
have
to
get
close
to
your
enemy
to
use
it
i
do
not
need
protection
said
sophia
you
will
be
out
there
protecting
me
if
you
take
it
it
will
put
my
mind
at
ease
said
daoud
for
that
reason
only
said
sophia
dropping
the
tiny
crossbow
and
the
box
of
darts
into
a
leather
bag
on
top
of
her
own
traveling
chest
daoud
picked
up
the
locket
its
hammered
silver
outer
surface
glowed
softly
in
the
candlelight
please
take
this
too
he
said
you
have
seen
me
wear
it
many
times
after
i
have
left
you
today
open
it
i
believe
you
will
see
a
picture
an
image
of
me
she
lowered
her
head
and
rested
her
hands
on
his
armored
chest
as
he
hung
the
locket
on
its
silver
chain
around
her
neck
he
unfolded
his
linen
cape
and
draped
it
over
himself
clasping
it
at
his
throat
with
a
gold
chain
he
took
her
in
his
arms
carefully
so
as
not
to
hurt
her
with
the
steel
breastplate
and
pressed
his
lips
against
hers
for
a
long
time
a
knock
at
the
door
broke
their
kiss
my
lord
your
horse
is
ready
said
husain
voice
at
the
door
of
the
house
ugolini
and
tilia
both
of
them
heavily
cloaked
against
the
cold
night
air
were
waiting
for
them
in
the
light
of
the
single
small
oil
lamp
burning
beside
the
doorway
they
were
two
short
bulky
shadows
tilia
much
bulkier
than
ugolini
we
heard
you
moving
about
said
tilia
we
came
down
to
wish
you
victory
what
do
the
stars
say
about
today
daoud
asked
ugolini
yesterday
the
of
february
the
sun
moved
from
the
house
of
aquarius
the
to
the
house
of
pisces
the
fish
ugolini
shook
his
head
dolefully
the
fish
is
the
sign
of
christendom
adelberto
you
are
a
poor
astrologer
said
tilia
heartily
a
good
astrologer
would
find
something
encouraging
to
say
for
example
it
would
not
be
good
for
christendom
for
charles
to
win
the
french
would
dominate
the
church
and
corrupt
it
true
christianity
will
triumph
if
manfred
wins
do
not
use
the
word
madama
tilia
said
daoud
with
a
smile
i
know
manfred
is
going
to
win
said
ugolini
otherwise
i
would
not
have
followed
his
army
all
the
way
to
benevento
i
believe
he
will
go
on
to
the
papal
states
and
will
persuade
pope
clement
to
restore
me
to
my
rightful
position
if
pope
clement
for
manfred
after
charles
is
defeated
said
tilia
dryly
that
was
ugolini
explanation
of
why
he
had
come
north
with
army
daoud
wondered
what
tilia
was
both
risked
being
imprisoned
and
probably
executed
should
manfred
lose
and
charles
capture
them
did
you
see
lorenzo
leave
moments
before
you
came
down
said
tilia
that
big
dog
of
his
scipio
is
inconsolable
i
can
hear
him
keening
in
the
stable
i
think
adelberto
and
i
will
take
him
up
to
our
room
and
comfort
him
daoud
said
it
is
a
rare
moment
when
scipio
is
not
at
lorenzo
side
and
i
think
too
he
can
sense
when
his
master
is
in
danger
as
we
all
are
today
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
care
for
him
with
a
tremulous
attempt
at
laughter
sophia
said
and
who
will
care
for
me
tilia
laid
her
small
hand
on
sophia
arm
we
will
stay
with
you
sophia
if
you
want
until
daoud
returns
she
pulled
ugolini
inside
the
door
and
it
closed
behind
them
leaving
daoud
and
sophia
alone
sophia
moved
close
in
the
lamplight
outside
the
entrance
of
the
merchant
house
and
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
large
and
solemn
nothing
but
you
matters
to
me
come
back
to
me
daoud
still
wished
he
could
convince
her
that
she
had
nothing
to
fear
but
that
was
foolish
she
knew
all
too
well
that
there
was
much
to
fear
i
do
want
you
to
be
frightened
he
said
i
will
try
not
to
be
i
will
come
back
there
was
so
much
he
wanted
to
tell
her
so
much
he
realized
now
he
had
not
said
about
how
he
loved
her
as
he
had
never
loved
another
woman
in
his
life
since
since
his
mother
they
were
two
people
who
had
been
utterly
alone
in
the
world
who
had
both
lost
everyone
precious
to
them
all
they
truly
had
was
each
other
god
let
me
come
back
to
her
i
ask
this
not
for
my
happiness
but
for
i
know
i
will
see
you
again
she
smiled
suddenly
can
you
find
your
way
to
me
he
looked
up
at
the
building
and
then
at
the
street
bulking
large
against
the
stars
was
the
huge
square
shape
of
an
arch
which
had
been
built
over
a
thousand
years
ago
he
was
told
by
a
roman
general
to
commemorate
his
conquest
of
jerusalem
with
this
talk
of
stars
and
portents
he
felt
it
must
mean
something
that
this
victory
arch
should
be
here
in
benevento
were
not
these
wars
of
muslim
and
christian
that
had
shaped
his
destiny
wars
over
jerusalem
he
said
i
will
ride
through
that
arch
and
you
will
be
on
the
third
floor
of
the
house
with
the
carving
over
the
door
of
san
giorgio
slaying
the
dragon
she
smiled
her
teeth
white
in
the
lantern
light
that
is
the
archangel
michael
overcoming
satan
how
am
i
to
tell
one
christian
idol
from
another
she
pushed
at
him
he
saw
the
tracks
of
tears
glistening
on
her
cheeks
his
own
eyes
burned
go
quickly
now
he
turned
fearing
the
sight
of
his
tears
might
break
her
heart
as
hers
had
broken
his
he
set
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
vaulted
into
the
saddle
of
the
brown
arabian
husain
was
holding
he
waited
for
husain
to
mount
his
own
horse
and
then
started
down
the
street
he
kept
his
face
set
toward
the
triumphal
arch
he
dared
not
look
back
in
her
room
sophia
went
through
her
chest
and
found
her
icon
of
saint
simon
stylites
she
kept
the
icon
hidden
when
daoud
was
around
he
believed
that
praying
to
saints
images
was
idolatry
and
she
especially
did
not
want
him
to
see
her
praying
to
a
saint
named
simon
she
knelt
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
to
the
desert
saint
holy
simon
bring
him
back
to
me
you
who
dwelt
in
the
desert
you
who
know
what
it
is
to
be
alone
on
your
pillar
keep
safe
this
man
who
came
alone
out
of
the
desert
protect
him
from
the
swords
and
spears
and
arrows
of
his
enemies
he
is
not
of
our
faith
i
know
but
i
love
him
so
and
is
not
love
another
name
for
god
she
pressed
both
hands
flat
against
her
belly
and
doubled
over
weeping
daoud
had
just
ridden
through
the
northern
gate
of
the
town
when
he
heard
his
name
called
from
above
he
saw
a
pale
blond
head
gleaming
in
the
first
rays
of
sunrise
looking
down
at
him
through
the
battlements
of
a
square
gate
tower
up
here
daoud
come
up
manfred
voice
this
is
the
best
vantage
point
we
could
ask
for
manfred
said
when
daoud
arrived
on
the
tower
platform
unless
we
were
to
climb
those
mountains
over
there
lorenzo
was
on
the
tower
roof
with
manfred
and
landgrave
barth
and
six
or
so
of
manfred
blond
young
noblemen
all
in
splendid
cloaks
of
peacock
blue
sunset
orange
and
they
wore
glossy
silk
surcoats
over
mail
that
covered
them
from
chin
to
fingertips
manfred
was
in
mail
covered
by
a
yellow
and
black
surcoat
he
held
his
bronzed
helmet
decorated
with
three
nodding
ostrich
plumes
dyed
emerald
green
tucked
under
his
arm
have
they
come
daoud
asked
manfred
nodded
his
face
sterner
than
daoud
had
ever
seen
it
anjou
is
in
the
valley
daoud
looked
out
from
the
tower
like
a
field
of
wildflowers
hundreds
of
their
own
multicolored
tents
each
one
tall
and
pointed
at
the
top
spread
out
over
the
rolling
brown
landscape
just
beyond
the
town
wall
in
front
of
the
tents
the
divisions
of
manfred
army
were
forming
up
in
squares
the
faint
notes
of
a
military
band
came
to
daoud
ear
it
was
european
music
which
sounded
jagged
harsh
and
disconnected
to
him
he
saw
the
sons
of
the
falcon
now
over
on
the
left
their
rows
straight
sitting
quietly
on
their
horses
moving
little
they
all
wore
red
turbans
wrapped
around
their
helmets
he
had
insisted
that
they
dress
alike
so
as
to
be
easily
recognizable
they
too
had
their
band
a
dozen
men
who
played
kettledrums
trumpets
hautboys
and
cymbals
from
horseback
the
band
was
silent
now
but
would
play
when
the
sons
of
the
falcon
rode
into
battle
long
ago
the
romans
called
this
town
maleventum
bad
wind
said
manfred
beside
him
because
they
believed
that
the
winds
from
the
north
brought
pestilence
down
from
the
swamps
around
rome
just
the
sort
of
thing
manfred
would
know
daoud
thought
even
though
the
people
who
live
here
chose
a
more
attractive
name
manfred
went
on
we
see
that
the
ancients
were
not
wrong
look
what
plague
the
wind
has
blown
down
from
rome
today
daoud
eyes
followed
manfred
pointing
arm
to
the
narrow
north
end
of
the
long
valley
in
which
benevento
lay
the
road
from
rome
entered
the
valley
at
the
north
end
and
ran
through
it
to
the
gate
above
which
they
were
standing
rows
of
tents
filled
the
northern
opening
of
the
valley
and
the
tiny
figures
of
horsemen
and
foot
soldiers
were
forming
dark
lines
across
the
light
brown
fields
last
night
peasants
from
that
end
of
the
valley
had
come
flocking
into
benevento
with
cartloads
of
possessions
and
stored
crops
even
though
they
were
supposedly
supporters
of
the
papal
cause
the
people
who
lived
around
benevento
felt
safer
under
manfred
protection
but
this
valley
was
a
stone
coffin
daoud
thought
hills
on
either
side
squeezing
together
at
the
top
of
the
valley
the
town
lying
across
the
bottom
end
in
this
box
how
could
he
use
the
sons
of
the
falcon
well
he
pummeled
his
brain
one
thing
he
could
at
least
achieve
he
remembered
nuwaihi
report
that
the
tartars
were
with
charles
army
he
turned
to
lorenzo
it
falls
to
you
to
finish
the
tartars
make
your
way
into
camp
while
the
battle
is
on
lorenzo
mouth
turned
down
under
his
thick
mustache
it
will
take
time
i
can
take
a
wagon
and
go
around
through
the
hills
and
pretend
to
be
a
peasant
offering
to
sell
wine
and
food
to
anjou
people
take
some
men
with
you
lorenzo
shook
his
head
that
would
arouse
suspicion
if
i
go
alone
whoever
is
guarding
charles
camp
will
see
no
reason
to
fear
me
i
went
alone
into
the
palazzo
monaldeschi
to
kill
them
and
i
could
not
do
it
and
i
with
my
poor
sicilian
skills
can
not
be
expected
to
succeed
where
daoud
ibn
abdallah
who
was
trained
by
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
himself
failed
is
that
what
you
are
thinking
daoud
smiled
ruefully
well
lorenzo
frowned
at
him
ferociously
you
have
given
me
the
task
let
me
carry
it
out
as
best
i
can
daoud
gripped
his
arm
feeling
muscle
like
oak
go
with
god
my
brother
may
your
allah
bless
your
struggle
today
daoud
one
last
long
look
from
the
dark
brown
eyes
and
lorenzo
turned
away
again
as
he
had
with
sophia
daoud
felt
anguish
that
he
had
not
told
lorenzo
enough
of
his
gratitude
his
respect
his
love
if
lorenzo
dies
an
unbeliever
i
will
not
meet
him
in
manfred
was
standing
at
the
battlements
staring
north
at
his
enemies
looking
it
seemed
to
daoud
more
sad
than
angry
sire
daoud
said
i
know
what
you
plan
for
today
battle
but
i
beg
the
favor
of
one
change
let
the
sons
of
the
falcon
be
the
first
of
your
warriors
to
strike
at
your
enemies
manfred
turned
toward
daoud
and
as
he
did
the
melancholy
vanished
from
his
face
he
looked
cheerful
and
spoke
briskly
let
us
review
the
plan
my
heaviest
cavalry
the
swabian
knights
will
hit
them
first
the
swabians
will
try
to
break
the
enemy
and
drive
them
back
up
the
field
our
foot
archers
will
form
up
before
benevento
and
protect
it
from
any
frenchmen
who
might
evade
our
cavalry
charge
daoud
sons
of
the
falcon
will
ride
in
column
up
the
west
side
of
the
valley
turn
cut
the
french
knights
off
from
foot
soldiers
and
attack
them
from
the
rear
erhard
barth
nodded
excellent
sire
but
if
i
may
herr
daoud
has
a
good
suggestion
we
have
seen
the
skill
of
his
archers
and
lancers
let
them
lead
the
way
forming
a
screen
for
us
let
them
fill
the
air
with
arrows
the
french
will
falter
then
the
sons
of
the
falcon
will
move
out
of
the
way
he
spread
his
big
square
hands
apart
to
show
how
the
sons
of
the
falcon
would
part
to
left
and
right
and
we
will
hit
them
with
a
wedge
a
better
plan
daoud
thought
he
had
underestimated
barth
and
perhaps
the
king
he
served
manfred
nodded
go
to
your
men
daoud
you
will
have
my
orders
shortly
looking
into
the
faces
of
the
two
hundred
men
he
had
picked
and
trained
over
the
past
year
daoud
felt
a
great
weight
on
his
chest
he
could
even
read
the
expressions
of
some
in
the
front
mujtaba
earnest
ahmad
fierce
omar
determined
nuwaihi
who
had
first
sighted
charles
army
eager
it
was
frightful
enough
to
face
one
own
death
in
battle
but
to
know
that
he
was
leading
to
their
deaths
men
he
knew
and
loved
the
burden
was
great
these
men
were
like
his
children
and
they
would
follow
him
to
destruction
and
he
wished
before
god
that
he
did
not
have
to
think
about
that
gathered
in
a
semicircle
the
sons
of
the
falcon
listened
silently
as
daoud
spoke
to
them
from
horseback
he
made
his
voice
big
so
that
it
echoed
from
the
walls
of
benevento
behind
his
men
you
are
fighting
not
only
to
help
king
manfred
keep
his
throne
daoud
shouted
not
only
to
protect
the
kingdom
of
sicily
from
conquest
by
these
greedy
foreigners
that
was
ironic
in
a
way
because
to
be
sure
the
hohenstaufens
were
not
native
sicilians
nor
were
these
muslims
but
both
they
and
the
hohenstaufens
had
lived
in
sicily
for
generations
and
surely
that
gave
them
more
right
to
rule
here
than
the
french
you
are
fighting
for
islam
he
cried
their
wild
cheering
rang
in
his
ears
you
are
fighting
that
you
and
your
families
may
profess
the
faith
and
live
by
the
faith
this
right
your
wise
rulers
of
the
house
of
hohenstaufen
have
granted
you
but
if
charles
rules
this
land
your
mosques
will
be
turned
into
churches
your
mullahs
will
be
hanged
your
korans
will
be
burned
and
your
children
children
will
never
hear
the
sweet
words
of
the
prophet
may
god
commend
and
salute
him
they
will
be
raised
as
christians
and
will
never
know
they
were
anything
else
for
us
this
war
is
jihad
holy
war
the
waves
of
their
cheering
swept
over
him
and
their
scimitars
flashed
in
the
rising
sun
he
had
told
them
the
truth
but
there
was
an
even
greater
truth
he
had
not
told
them
they
were
fighting
not
just
for
islam
in
sicily
but
for
islam
everywhere
if
manfred
won
this
battle
it
would
end
for
this
generation
at
least
the
threat
of
christians
and
tartars
uniting
to
destroy
islam
but
how
to
explain
that
in
these
few
remaining
moments
enough
that
they
knew
that
they
were
fighting
for
the
faith
in
their
own
land
seeing
their
eagerness
he
felt
proud
of
them
and
proud
of
himself
the
weight
of
sadness
he
had
felt
when
he
first
faced
them
was
lifted
and
his
heart
beat
strong
within
him
the
cheering
faded
quickly
replaced
by
a
murmuring
men
were
pointing
past
him
a
faint
rumbling
came
to
his
ears
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
a
long
line
of
horsemen
was
moving
forward
bright
banners
fluttering
above
them
and
creamy
clouds
of
dust
billowing
up
behind
them
barth
rode
up
to
him
his
eyes
bright
his
thick
lower
lip
curving
upward
in
a
smile
king
manfred
has
agreed
to
let
you
attack
first
the
swabian
knights
are
now
ready
we
will
be
behind
you
slow
their
charge
and
then
we
will
smash
them
he
struck
a
mailed
fist
into
a
mailed
palm
exultation
bubbled
up
within
daoud
like
a
desert
spring
dizzy
with
joy
he
thought
baibars
must
have
felt
like
this
when
he
alone
led
the
mamelukes
against
the
tartars
at
the
well
of
goliath
a
certainty
that
the
battle
was
as
good
as
won
spread
through
him
if
we
leave
you
any
frenchmen
to
smash
he
said
to
barth
who
laughed
saluted
and
rode
away
a
he
warned
himself
happens
today
will
be
as
god
wants
i
want
only
whatever
god
he
jerked
on
the
reins
of
his
brown
arabian
to
turn
toward
the
french
charge
they
were
still
far
away
the
valley
was
long
he
called
omar
and
husain
to
him
bows
and
arrows
spread
out
in
a
line
when
we
are
formed
up
advance
at
a
trot
on
my
signal
he
unstrapped
his
bow
from
his
saddle
and
slung
it
over
his
shoulder
and
across
his
chest
the
five
flag
men
lined
up
behind
daoud
on
their
right
rode
a
naqeeb
holding
high
the
green
banner
of
the
sons
of
the
falcon
inscribed
in
dazzling
white
lettering
with
a
verse
from
the
koran
have
they
not
seen
the
birds
obedient
in
midair
none
upholdeth
them
save
god
omar
rode
down
the
line
relaying
daoud
orders
to
the
officers
and
flag
men
when
all
was
ready
daoud
raised
his
hand
and
brought
it
down
a
single
line
of
two
hundred
horsemen
they
moved
out
at
a
trot
while
his
men
could
fire
arrows
from
a
galloping
horse
the
slower
the
horse
was
moving
the
more
accurate
the
shooting
he
could
see
what
was
coming
at
him
much
more
clearly
now
the
middle
and
rear
ranks
of
the
crusaders
were
obscured
by
dust
but
in
the
front
ranks
a
hundred
or
more
helmeted
heads
bent
over
the
armored
brows
of
their
huge
horses
the
long
poles
of
their
lances
pointed
at
him
to
be
hit
by
one
of
those
knights
galloping
at
that
speed
with
all
that
weight
of
steel
and
horseflesh
would
be
like
being
hit
by
a
boulder
from
a
stone
caster
if
the
franks
got
much
closer
there
would
be
no
stopping
them
daoud
unslung
his
bow
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
flag
men
whose
duty
it
was
to
watch
his
moves
and
signals
lift
five
red
pennants
high
he
did
not
need
to
look
to
know
that
the
sons
of
the
falcon
had
all
dropped
their
horses
reins
guiding
their
horses
with
their
knees
and
were
drawing
their
bows
his
bow
like
those
his
men
carried
was
made
of
multiple
layers
of
horn
and
hardwood
his
arrow
had
a
thick
steel
tip
that
could
punch
through
mail
armor
like
a
spike
driven
by
a
hammer
he
took
aim
at
a
big
frank
in
the
middle
of
the
line
the
intersection
of
the
limbs
of
the
red
cross
on
the
frank
white
surcoat
made
a
perfect
spot
to
aim
at
between
two
beats
of
his
arabian
hooves
he
loosed
his
arrow
the
flight
of
daoud
arrow
was
the
signal
for
the
red
flags
to
go
down
two
hundred
arrows
whistled
across
the
rapidly
narrowing
gap
between
crusaders
and
sons
of
the
falcon
daoud
saw
the
man
he
had
fired
at
throw
his
arms
wide
his
lance
dropped
as
he
leaned
sideways
from
his
saddle
he
crashed
to
the
ground
and
disappeared
under
the
hooves
of
the
horses
behind
his
his
lance
fell
across
the
paths
of
the
oncoming
crusaders
and
another
of
the
big
war
horses
tripped
over
it
dumping
its
rider
all
along
the
crusaders
front
knights
were
spilling
from
their
saddles
horses
were
falling
lances
were
flying
a
hundred
years
they
have
fought
us
and
they
have
never
learned
to
use
the
bow
from
the
many
riders
in
the
crusaders
front
rank
were
still
galloping
toward
them
and
more
in
the
rear
ranks
were
dodging
or
leaping
the
fallen
knights
and
horses
daoud
whipped
a
second
arrow
from
the
quiver
hanging
at
his
side
nocked
it
and
took
quick
aim
his
arrow
went
true
again
he
saw
the
targeted
man
fall
and
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
pouring
volleys
of
arrows
into
the
franks
every
third
crusader
in
the
front
ranks
at
least
must
be
a
dead
man
daoud
heard
himself
yelling
in
triumph
if
they
broke
this
first
french
charge
the
rest
of
manfred
army
could
sweep
the
field
clear
of
the
enemy
the
charge
was
slowing
down
but
it
was
still
coming
on
split
ranks
pass
them
on
either
side
daoud
called
to
omar
who
relayed
the
order
to
the
flag
men
daoud
heard
a
sound
like
an
earthquake
behind
him
and
looked
around
the
elite
of
the
german
knights
manfred
swabians
were
galloping
on
in
an
arrowhead
formation
if
the
french
knights
and
their
horses
were
big
the
swabians
looked
even
bigger
he
saw
the
nodding
green
plumes
of
manfred
helmet
at
the
very
point
of
the
wedge
the
surcoats
of
knights
and
horses
were
ablaze
with
red
and
blue
orange
and
yellow
beyond
manfred
knights
daoud
saw
lines
of
crossbowmen
formed
up
before
the
walls
of
benevento
sophia
was
there
in
that
little
town
he
wanted
to
keep
himself
between
sophia
and
the
french
but
omar
had
relayed
his
order
to
the
flag
men
and
the
yellow
and
green
flags
had
gone
up
and
disciplined
as
any
of
his
men
he
rode
off
to
the
left
turning
the
side
of
his
arabian
toward
the
onrushing
crusaders
when
he
reached
the
right
flank
of
charles
knights
he
turned
again
so
that
he
was
riding
past
them
he
fired
arrow
after
arrow
as
he
went
as
fast
as
he
could
and
still
hit
his
mark
he
saw
a
tall
figure
in
a
red
surcoat
with
a
red
helmet
shaped
like
a
bishop
miter
almost
certainly
de
verceuil
the
cardinal
brandished
a
club
with
an
iron
ball
at
the
end
of
it
daoud
loosed
an
arrow
at
him
but
de
verceuil
lifted
a
red
shield
bearing
a
painted
gold
cross
that
caught
the
arrow
and
sent
it
spinning
away
wonder
if
he
recognizes
looking
north
daoud
saw
anjou
foot
soldiers
with
spears
and
crossbows
advancing
at
a
run
but
they
were
far
behind
the
last
of
the
frankish
riders
charles
must
have
thrown
all
his
knights
eight
hundred
of
them
manfred
had
said
into
this
first
charge
he
like
manfred
must
have
hoped
to
end
the
battle
even
the
war
with
a
single
charge
farther
to
the
north
beyond
the
foot
soldiers
a
dozen
or
so
horsemen
in
yellow
and
purple
cloaks
gathered
under
a
red
banner
bearing
a
black
figure
it
was
too
far
away
for
daoud
to
see
clearly
but
he
knew
that
a
black
lion
on
a
red
background
was
the
standard
of
charles
now
daoud
and
his
left
half
of
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
beyond
the
french
knights
he
ordered
the
flag
signals
that
would
turn
his
wing
to
ride
back
the
way
they
had
come
dozens
of
franks
had
died
under
their
arrows
the
charge
had
slowed
with
confusion
on
the
front
and
confusion
on
the
sides
daoud
felt
ripples
of
triumph
course
through
his
body
they
had
done
the
very
thing
manfred
said
no
saracen
cavalry
could
do
stopped
the
charge
of
the
frankish
but
looking
toward
benevento
daoud
felt
triumph
turn
to
dismay
the
flying
wedge
of
manfred
knights
had
pushed
itself
deep
into
the
french
line
but
then
had
come
to
a
stop
even
though
the
sons
of
the
falcon
had
hurt
them
and
halted
them
the
french
had
held
their
formation
they
had
not
broken
under
the
swabian
attack
daoud
groaned
in
anguish
both
sides
had
stopped
in
their
tracks
and
where
they
faced
each
other
their
formations
had
crumbled
into
a
hundred
individual
combats
this
was
just
what
daoud
had
feared
and
warned
against
endless
butchery
futile
bloodletting
a
battle
that
would
go
as
badly
for
the
winner
as
for
the
loser
must
be
another
daoud
thought
desperately
must
be
a
mameluke
way
to
win
lxviii
thierry
reined
his
horse
to
a
stop
and
doffed
his
helmet
in
salute
to
simon
from
the
wild
look
in
the
young
knight
eye
simon
sensed
at
once
that
he
had
seen
something
extraordinary
what
is
it
messire
he
demanded
did
you
see
manfred
army
papillon
the
brown
and
white
mare
simon
used
as
a
palfrey
stood
still
while
simon
patted
her
neck
manfred
count
charles
thierry
panted
both
armies
already
fighting
monseigneur
merciful
god
a
battle
meant
battle
one
battle
must
surely
decide
this
war
manfred
would
have
brought
together
all
the
fighting
men
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
and
simon
knew
from
the
series
of
urgent
messages
he
had
received
from
charles
on
the
road
that
the
count
had
left
rome
with
every
man
he
could
muster
and
that
there
was
no
more
help
on
its
way
to
him
for
this
simon
glanced
up
at
the
sun
halfway
up
the
eastern
sky
some
big
clouds
but
it
was
going
to
remain
a
clear
cold
day
if
the
battle
had
started
at
dawn
it
could
be
over
by
midday
pass
the
word
to
advance
at
a
trot
he
told
de
puys
foot
soldiers
to
proceed
by
forced
march
antoine
de
la
durie
spoke
up
monseigneur
should
we
not
call
a
halt
and
rest
and
plan
we
can
not
plunge
blindly
into
the
midst
of
a
battle
we
will
have
to
plan
as
we
ride
messire
simon
said
brusquely
king
charles
is
outnumbered
and
needs
us
he
felt
a
small
inner
glow
he
was
getting
to
be
quite
practiced
at
putting
older
men
of
lower
rank
in
their
place
the
sort
who
formerly
intimidated
him
he
turned
to
valery
de
pirenne
tell
friar
volpe
to
join
me
here
and
you
thierry
come
with
me
you
can
tell
the
friar
what
you
saw
simon
pulled
papillon
head
over
jumped
the
narrow
ditch
along
the
side
of
the
road
and
took
up
a
position
on
a
rocky
hummock
thierry
beside
him
looking
over
the
long
column
of
his
army
never
failed
to
make
his
heart
beat
faster
a
dozen
banners
in
front
led
by
the
red
and
white
crusader
flag
and
the
purple
and
gold
of
gobignon
mounted
knights
two
or
three
abreast
followed
by
files
of
foot
soldiers
and
baggage
trains
and
strings
of
chargers
and
spare
horses
the
mounted
rear
guard
so
far
back
it
was
usually
out
of
sight
he
could
see
the
rear
guard
because
the
army
was
traveling
along
winding
mountain
roads
as
it
had
been
the
day
before
and
the
day
before
that
they
were
crossing
the
center
of
the
italian
peninsula
they
had
been
through
the
highest
of
the
apennines
yesterday
and
were
now
descending
the
western
slopes
a
chill
anxiety
enveloped
his
body
to
have
come
all
this
way
only
to
be
too
late
what
a
calamity
that
would
be
he
could
not
allow
it
friar
volpe
came
galloping
up
on
the
back
of
his
big
mule
how
wise
of
charles
to
have
sent
this
friar
to
meet
simon
at
ravenna
the
dominican
had
spent
most
of
his
adult
life
wandering
all
over
italy
preaching
and
he
made
an
excellent
guide
it
was
he
who
brought
the
news
that
charles
was
no
longer
in
rome
and
there
was
no
need
for
simon
army
to
go
there
a
more
direct
route
to
anjou
army
would
follow
the
adriatic
coast
then
turn
southward
into
the
apennines
on
entering
the
abruzzi
the
northernmost
reach
of
manfred
kingdom
friar
volpe
was
a
man
with
a
sharp
nose
large
lips
and
round
brown
eyes
his
thick
hair
fell
over
his
forehead
and
ears
growing
luxuriantly
everywhere
except
for
the
tonsure
on
top
where
it
was
just
a
red
stubble
benevento
he
said
when
simon
told
him
about
the
battle
and
glanced
up
at
the
sun
we
could
arrive
in
the
valley
of
benevento
well
before
noon
there
is
a
high
ridge
along
the
east
side
of
the
valley
benevento
is
a
crossroads
town
the
roads
meet
at
the
south
end
of
the
valley
that
was
where
i
saw
manfred
camp
said
thierry
i
have
to
see
this
valley
myself
simon
said
could
we
climb
this
ridge
you
spoke
of
shepherds
and
their
flocks
go
up
and
down
the
hills
all
year
round
said
friar
volpe
there
are
many
paths
many
paths
simon
echoed
excellent
be
good
enough
to
lead
us
there
simon
ordered
the
army
to
continue
along
the
main
road
to
benevento
until
they
reached
a
roadside
shrine
to
san
rocco
farther
than
that
friar
volpe
said
and
they
might
be
seen
from
benevento
friar
volpe
led
simon
at
a
fast
trot
till
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
army
thierry
and
henri
de
puys
had
insisted
on
coming
along
arguing
that
simon
might
meet
some
of
manfred
outriders
they
turned
onto
a
zigzag
track
that
sometimes
disappeared
altogether
over
bare
rocks
as
it
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
long
ridge
they
came
out
of
a
stand
of
pine
trees
to
the
bald
top
of
the
ridge
the
ringing
of
steel
on
steel
the
pounding
of
hooves
and
the
cries
of
men
drifted
to
them
from
below
hold
the
horses
thierry
simon
ordered
he
and
de
puys
and
friar
volpe
moved
forward
at
a
crouch
when
he
could
see
the
battlefield
simon
lay
down
and
crawled
his
mail
scraping
over
the
rocks
the
tip
of
his
sheathed
sword
bumping
along
this
what
a
battle
looks
like
then
he
was
reminded
of
times
when
he
had
stepped
on
anthills
in
the
woods
and
thousands
of
the
little
creatures
milled
about
in
confusion
under
his
feet
masses
of
men
below
heaved
and
struggled
dead
horses
lay
by
the
score
large
dark
lumps
smaller
objects
lying
about
the
field
like
rocks
might
be
dead
men
it
was
hard
to
tell
from
this
distance
much
of
what
he
saw
was
partly
veiled
by
clouds
of
gray
dust
he
felt
a
breath
of
fear
on
his
neck
at
the
thought
that
he
must
take
his
army
into
that
cauldron
he
tried
to
make
sense
of
what
he
was
seeing
where
were
the
leaders
the
half
of
the
field
nearer
him
was
hidden
by
the
trees
growing
lower
down
on
this
ridge
ignoring
de
puys
whispered
warnings
he
crawled
farther
forward
for
a
better
view
now
he
saw
the
town
of
benevento
at
the
south
end
of
the
valley
a
city
of
moderate
size
whose
walls
were
fortified
by
a
dozen
square
towers
and
before
it
a
smaller
city
of
tents
above
the
tents
a
yellow
banner
with
a
black
splotch
in
its
center
that
would
be
the
hohenstaufen
eagle
then
those
tents
at
the
other
end
of
the
valley
where
the
road
entered
from
the
north
must
be
the
french
camp
simon
saw
many
more
banners
too
far
away
to
recognize
on
poles
in
the
center
of
that
camp
he
saw
no
fighting
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
closer
to
the
battle
a
small
group
of
horsemen
sat
on
a
low
hill
apparently
observing
above
them
a
red
and
black
banner
hung
from
a
long
pole
that
could
only
be
charles
himself
and
his
chief
commanders
under
the
banner
of
the
black
lion
lines
of
foot
soldiers
screened
them
from
the
main
fighting
should
go
down
there
or
send
someone
to
find
out
what
count
charles
wants
me
to
do
but
there
is
no
again
simon
gaze
swept
the
battlefield
the
innumerable
small
struggles
mostly
in
the
center
of
the
valley
told
him
that
neither
side
was
winning
again
the
saracen
warriors
with
the
turbans
caught
his
eye
they
were
the
only
group
of
mounted
men
acting
together
moving
in
a
formation
with
the
center
back
and
the
tips
of
the
two
wings
well
forward
they
advanced
slowly
across
the
field
but
with
such
confusion
around
them
where
could
they
effectively
attack
mind
that
where
can
i
effectively
attack
he
lay
on
his
belly
his
chin
resting
on
his
intertwined
fingers
his
breath
steaming
in
the
air
in
front
of
him
thierry
de
puys
and
friar
volpe
were
waiting
behind
him
and
behind
them
the
army
he
had
brought
here
a
sudden
terror
froze
his
limbs
the
day
was
cold
but
he
felt
colder
still
staring
at
the
swirling
fury
below
him
listening
to
the
shouts
and
screams
the
thundering
and
clanging
there
would
not
be
time
to
get
orders
from
count
charles
there
would
hardly
be
time
to
consult
with
the
experienced
men
de
marion
de
la
durie
de
puys
among
the
barons
he
had
brought
with
him
the
plan
the
decisions
would
have
to
be
his
alone
at
what
place
at
what
moment
should
he
throw
the
gobignon
army
into
the
battle
if
he
just
led
them
into
the
present
confusion
his
columns
of
knights
and
files
of
archers
would
at
once
fall
apart
into
more
knots
and
whirlpools
of
combat
like
those
he
saw
below
his
army
could
be
wasted
ground
up
like
wheat
in
a
water
mill
the
turmoil
in
his
mind
was
as
bad
as
the
chaos
he
had
seen
on
the
field
the
floor
of
the
valley
was
uneven
and
rolling
hills
hid
the
battle
from
lorenzo
eyes
but
the
clash
and
clamor
of
the
fighting
carried
to
his
ears
as
he
approached
the
french
camp
it
was
empty
except
for
about
ten
sentries
some
armed
with
crossbows
others
with
pikes
who
stood
at
its
perimeter
they
were
all
turned
to
watch
the
battle
their
backs
to
lorenzo
despite
the
creaking
of
his
wagon
and
the
of
his
horse
hooves
the
tall
tents
were
dusty
stained
and
patched
their
colors
faded
lorenzo
spotted
a
party
of
horsemen
in
bright
cloaks
atop
a
hill
outside
the
camp
one
helmet
was
topped
with
a
gilded
crown
charles
was
being
sensible
standing
back
from
the
battle
and
watching
it
unlike
manfred
whom
lorenzo
had
seen
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
hohenstaufen
camp
riding
into
the
fray
waving
his
great
broadsword
lorenzo
shook
his
head
sadly
my
king
needs
is
less
gallantry
and
more
holding
up
a
parchment
covered
with
elaborate
handwriting
and
a
large
seal
of
green
wax
with
long
ribbons
he
pulled
his
cart
up
to
the
nearest
guard
a
stout
man
with
bleary
eyes
naturally
only
the
least
would
be
left
to
guard
the
camp
this
day
and
the
worst
they
would
be
expecting
would
be
attempts
at
thievery
by
the
whores
and
traders
whose
tents
and
wagons
lay
a
short
distance
up
the
road
from
the
camp
here
is
my
safe
conduct
from
king
charles
ally
the
bishop
of
agnani
said
lorenzo
briskly
he
held
his
breath
anxiously
while
the
guard
stared
at
him
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
man
you
ca
just
drive
your
cart
in
here
what
do
you
have
in
it
the
guard
barely
glanced
at
the
document
lorenzo
had
spent
a
precious
hour
forging
lorenzo
was
relieved
he
was
not
at
all
sure
the
scroll
would
bear
close
scrutiny
although
only
one
soldier
in
a
thousand
could
read
and
any
clerics
who
might
be
along
with
charles
would
probably
be
on
the
edges
of
the
battlefield
succoring
the
wounded
and
dying
i
bring
a
gift
of
wine
from
the
bishop
of
agnani
to
the
ambassadors
from
tartary
i
will
have
to
taste
the
wine
said
the
guard
importantly
of
course
said
lorenzo
with
a
grin
and
as
the
guard
climbed
into
the
dark
interior
of
the
cart
almost
fully
occupied
by
two
big
wine
casks
standing
on
their
bottoms
lorenzo
unhooked
a
tin
ladle
from
its
wooden
wall
and
handed
it
to
the
stout
man
stupid
as
well
as
unfit
this
guard
was
thought
lorenzo
he
could
stun
him
with
the
sack
of
sand
and
stones
hidden
under
his
tunic
or
slit
his
throat
with
the
dagger
in
his
boot
but
then
he
would
have
a
body
to
get
rid
of
this
particular
body
would
be
more
of
a
problem
dead
than
it
was
alive
and
conscious
lorenzo
turned
a
spigot
and
let
some
of
the
red
wine
flow
into
the
ladle
the
guard
smacked
his
lips
and
grunted
too
good
for
those
barbarians
right
my
friend
lorenzo
agreed
but
the
bishop
cultivates
their
friendship
because
he
finds
them
interesting
these
folk
have
no
common
sense
if
you
want
to
know
what
is
interesting
said
the
guard
what
is
interesting
is
the
pretty
little
putana
the
older
tartar
travels
with
they
say
she
a
jewess
i
have
often
wondered
if
she
would
be
partial
to
other
older
men
that
pig
of
a
tartar
dragged
that
poor
child
here
to
this
damned
that
is
interesting
all
right
now
where
the
hell
do
i
find
these
tartars
the
guard
poured
himself
another
ladle
full
of
wine
without
bothering
to
ask
and
drained
it
with
more
loud
lip
noises
then
he
and
lorenzo
climbed
out
of
the
cart
their
tent
is
the
one
with
blue
and
yellow
stripes
in
the
center
of
the
camp
you
see
it
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
find
them
there
lorenzo
had
suspected
that
the
tartars
would
not
stay
in
their
tent
if
they
were
out
watching
the
battle
with
charles
commanders
it
would
be
impossible
to
kill
them
in
full
view
of
so
many
of
the
enemy
but
that
had
occurred
to
him
before
he
left
manfred
camp
he
had
thought
of
another
way
to
carry
out
daoud
orders
along
with
the
casks
he
had
brought
one
jar
of
a
very
special
wine
laced
with
enough
belladonna
to
kill
a
whole
army
of
tartars
he
would
leave
that
to
greet
them
on
their
return
from
the
battle
then
he
would
unhitch
his
dappled
brown
and
white
gelding
a
good
riding
horse
and
scout
around
the
edges
of
the
battle
to
see
if
there
was
some
way
to
get
at
the
tartars
more
directly
a
crossbowman
sat
on
the
ground
at
the
entrance
to
the
blue
and
yellow
striped
tent
he
picked
up
the
bow
that
lay
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
jumped
to
his
feet
when
lorenzo
drove
up
lorenzo
remembered
seeing
him
guarding
the
tartars
in
orvieto
and
his
heart
beat
heavily
for
a
moment
but
the
man
gave
no
sign
of
recognizing
him
lorenzo
held
up
his
splendid
parchment
and
explained
his
mission
they
are
not
here
said
the
guard
sourly
well
the
bishop
of
agnani
is
an
important
ally
of
your
king
charles
help
me
unload
this
wine
lorenzo
went
around
the
cart
and
pulled
the
back
down
to
make
a
ramp
it
is
good
wine
lorenzo
continued
and
you
can
drink
your
fill
after
we
get
it
into
the
tent
the
tartars
will
not
miss
a
few
cupfuls
grumbling
despite
the
promised
reward
the
guard
helped
lorenzo
manhandle
the
cask
to
the
back
of
the
cart
tip
it
and
roll
it
down
to
the
ground
then
they
unloaded
the
other
one
the
guard
stood
back
to
let
lorenzo
roll
the
first
cask
by
himself
through
the
loose
flap
into
the
tartars
tent
stay
away
from
the
girl
he
growled
at
lorenzo
back
his
eminence
the
cardinal
says
she
under
arrest
lorenzo
stiffened
and
a
chill
gripped
him
what
danger
was
rachel
in
now
as
lorenzo
straightened
up
he
heard
a
gasp
the
tent
was
lit
by
a
single
candle
and
the
daylight
that
filtered
dimly
through
its
silk
walls
it
was
held
up
by
two
center
poles
and
an
oblong
framework
from
which
the
sides
were
hung
around
the
edges
were
camp
beds
between
the
center
posts
was
a
table
charcoal
glowed
in
a
brazier
warming
the
interior
of
the
tent
a
shadowy
figure
rushed
toward
him
lorenzo
backed
away
his
hand
reaching
inside
his
tunic
for
the
sandbag
lorenzo
rachel
his
voice
was
choked
her
arms
gripped
him
as
tightly
as
if
she
were
drowning
he
felt
warmth
flood
through
him
ah
rachel
he
had
not
seen
her
since
he
had
taken
her
to
tilia
caballo
and
not
a
day
went
by
that
he
had
not
cursed
himself
for
doing
so
she
looked
well
her
face
pink
but
thinner
than
he
remembered
she
was
he
realized
suddenly
very
beautiful
i
thought
your
name
was
giancarlo
said
a
dry
voice
lorenzo
looked
up
to
see
the
old
franciscan
monk
who
traveled
with
the
tartars
standing
near
him
what
is
going
on
here
the
venetian
burst
into
the
tent
get
your
hands
off
that
woman
he
drew
the
shortsword
he
wore
at
his
belt
lorenzo
instantly
let
go
of
rachel
and
stepped
back
he
bowed
low
spreading
his
hands
in
a
courtly
gesture
forgive
me
messere
he
said
in
a
placating
tone
a
cousin
his
hand
darted
for
his
boot
and
seized
the
handle
of
his
dagger
i
do
believe
that
for
a
the
venetian
began
but
his
guard
dropped
slightly
and
his
words
were
cut
off
when
lorenzo
blade
plunged
into
his
chest
jesus
have
mercy
said
the
old
franciscan
the
venetian
dropped
to
his
knees
and
fell
on
his
face
on
the
carpeted
wooden
floor
of
the
tent
try
to
give
an
alarm
and
you
are
dead
too
father
lorenzo
growled
no
lorenzo
no
rachel
cried
friar
mathieu
is
a
good
man
perhaps
that
would
not
matter
to
messer
lorenzo
said
friar
mathieu
his
eyes
fixed
on
lorenzo
with
a
penetrating
stare
if
as
i
suspect
he
serves
that
elegant
blasphemer
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
lorenzo
gave
a
short
bark
of
a
laugh
his
heart
was
galloping
friar
mathieu
knelt
and
whispered
prayers
in
latin
over
the
dead
venetian
with
his
thumb
he
traced
a
cross
on
the
man
forehead
you
think
there
is
no
good
to
be
found
in
king
manfred
camp
lorenzo
said
i
am
not
surprised
you
franciscans
pride
yourselves
on
your
ignorance
rachel
hand
rested
lightly
on
lorenzo
arm
lorenzo
i
beg
you
do
not
insult
friar
mathieu
he
has
been
my
only
friend
since
john
took
me
from
madama
tilia
house
what
are
you
doing
here
her
face
lit
up
with
hope
have
you
come
to
take
me
away
lorenzo
mind
was
working
rapidly
apparently
friar
mathieu
was
a
decent
sort
and
lorenzo
had
no
desire
to
kill
him
but
what
to
do
with
him
rachel
might
have
given
him
the
answer
this
was
in
fact
a
chance
to
get
her
away
from
the
tartars
and
daoud
he
knew
would
bless
him
for
it
where
are
the
tartars
rachel
he
said
they
put
on
mail
and
took
bows
and
arrows
and
swords
and
they
have
joined
the
fighting
lorenzo
was
astonished
charles
is
risking
their
lives
in
this
battle
pazzia
and
the
king
of
sicily
himself
was
not
even
fighting
yes
it
does
seem
mad
does
it
not
said
friar
mathieu
well
that
is
good
said
lorenzo
i
was
afraid
i
might
have
to
fight
them
for
you
rachel
why
did
this
lout
say
you
are
under
arrest
the
cardinal
accuses
me
of
spying
for
king
manfred
he
says
you
were
all
spying
you
madonna
sophia
messer
david
is
that
true
lorenzo
looked
from
rachel
to
friar
mathieu
there
was
no
need
to
keep
it
from
them
any
longer
for
good
or
ill
all
would
be
settled
today
in
a
word
yes
ah
friar
mathieu
exclaimed
i
knew
it
lorenzo
felt
himself
grinning
suddenly
i
could
tell
the
cardinal
that
you
knew
nothing
about
us
but
i
do
not
think
my
testimony
would
help
you
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
i
just
got
you
away
from
here
rachel
face
was
like
a
sunrise
oh
yes
yes
good
wait
one
moment
now
he
went
out
of
the
tent
and
looked
around
there
were
no
guards
in
sight
he
rolled
the
second
wine
cask
into
the
tent
and
set
it
beside
the
first
he
dragged
the
venetian
body
into
a
corner
where
anyone
looking
in
would
not
see
it
you
have
actually
come
here
in
the
midst
of
this
battle
to
rescue
rachel
from
john
the
tartar
said
friar
mathieu
the
old
priest
might
still
have
a
protective
feeling
toward
the
tartars
lorenzo
thought
best
not
to
tell
him
the
real
reason
i
guessed
that
right
now
there
would
be
less
of
a
guard
on
her
said
lorenzo
and
if
you
are
as
ashamed
of
your
part
in
what
has
happened
to
her
as
i
am
of
mine
you
will
help
me
you
really
should
come
with
me
willingly
said
friar
mathieu
i
have
no
great
confidence
in
your
ability
to
protect
rachel
you
seem
to
have
done
little
enough
for
her
yourself
said
lorenzo
gruffly
friar
mathieu
appeared
angry
as
he
opened
his
mouth
but
then
he
closed
it
again
without
speaking
good
christian
turning
the
other
trying
to
see
in
all
directions
at
once
lorenzo
carried
blankets
from
the
tent
and
threw
them
into
the
back
of
the
cart
he
took
the
jar
of
poisoned
wine
from
under
the
driver
seat
looking
around
for
guards
and
seeing
them
all
gazing
southward
toward
the
battle
he
went
back
into
the
tent
and
put
the
wine
on
the
table
this
wine
was
my
disguise
he
said
i
am
bringing
a
gift
of
wine
for
the
tartars
from
the
bishop
of
agnani
much
better
to
tell
them
no
more
than
that
my
chest
my
treasures
rachel
said
lorenzo
sprang
at
the
box
she
pointed
out
and
gripped
it
by
both
handles
he
was
shocked
at
its
weight
my
god
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
a
sudden
fear
came
over
him
there
was
no
time
for
this
if
he
were
caught
now
with
the
dead
venetian
rachel
would
surely
be
executed
and
he
along
with
her
he
hoisted
the
box
to
the
level
of
his
hipbone
feeling
as
if
his
spine
would
snap
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
put
their
hands
under
it
easing
the
load
a
little
panting
the
three
of
them
wrestled
the
chest
out
of
the
tent
and
with
one
effort
lorenzo
heaved
it
up
into
the
rear
of
the
cart
he
glanced
about
him
and
saw
that
they
were
still
not
being
watched
he
picked
up
the
dead
archer
crossbow
and
quiver
of
arrows
and
set
them
beside
the
driver
seat
at
the
front
of
the
cart
although
he
hoped
he
would
not
have
to
fight
his
way
out
of
this
place
bustling
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
into
the
cart
he
had
them
hide
under
the
blankets
in
case
any
of
the
guards
around
charles
camp
should
want
to
look
inside
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
held
his
breath
all
the
way
from
the
tent
to
the
edge
of
the
french
camp
but
the
elderly
guard
he
had
spoken
to
barely
glanced
at
him
as
he
drove
by
with
a
wave
the
battle
seemed
unchanged
as
his
cart
creaked
and
rattled
along
the
narrow
dirt
track
leading
through
the
hills
west
of
the
valley
save
that
more
dead
littered
the
rolling
brown
landscape
charles
still
stood
on
his
mound
not
deigning
to
get
into
the
fight
himself
horsemen
and
foot
soldiers
struggled
in
crowds
the
length
of
the
valley
the
tartars
whom
he
had
come
to
kill
must
be
fighting
down
there
somewhere
with
luck
they
would
die
either
on
the
battlefield
or
later
he
kept
his
eyes
moving
watching
everything
arrows
or
stragglers
from
the
battle
might
get
the
three
of
them
they
would
not
be
safe
until
they
reached
manfred
camp
if
then
oh
lorenzo
i
so
happy
crying
rachel
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
embarrassed
he
said
gruffly
easy
child
i
have
to
see
what
is
going
on
down
there
he
gently
pulled
her
arms
loose
the
track
had
climbed
high
enough
to
give
him
a
view
of
the
south
end
of
the
valley
with
a
glow
of
pleasure
he
saw
that
daoud
had
kept
the
sons
of
the
falcon
intact
there
was
their
green
banner
with
its
white
inscription
there
were
their
turbans
red
dots
forming
a
line
across
the
valley
a
warm
feeling
swept
over
him
as
he
made
out
daoud
figure
in
the
center
of
the
line
never
had
he
met
a
man
he
admired
more
not
even
manfred
he
caught
himself
praying
that
daoud
would
live
through
the
battle
and
be
victorious
he
had
seen
the
sons
of
the
falcon
attack
earlier
today
and
check
the
first
french
charge
with
their
volleys
of
arrows
now
they
seemed
to
be
riding
to
attack
again
what
was
their
objective
a
flash
of
light
above
the
battle
caught
his
eye
sunlight
reflected
on
metal
he
looked
across
at
the
bare
gray
rocks
that
topped
the
high
ridge
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
he
could
see
beyond
the
rocks
the
tips
of
a
pine
forest
again
the
flash
of
light
helmets
ten
or
more
conical
helmets
appeared
between
the
forest
and
the
rocks
men
were
crawling
over
the
top
of
the
ridge
the
lower
slopes
of
the
ridge
on
the
valley
side
were
heavily
forested
those
men
would
be
quite
hidden
from
anyone
looking
up
from
the
valley
who
were
they
and
how
many
the
hills
over
there
could
conceal
hundreds
they
could
be
some
of
manfred
troops
sent
up
there
to
make
a
surprise
flank
attack
but
manfred
had
rejected
just
such
a
plan
he
remembered
now
a
conversation
between
daoud
and
manfred
at
dawn
not
all
of
charles
allies
had
yet
arrived
the
gobignon
banner
for
instance
had
not
been
seen
with
charles
army
that
could
be
a
whole
fresh
army
of
frenchmen
up
there
on
that
ridge
about
to
fall
like
an
avalanche
on
manfred
forces
and
daoud
sons
of
the
falcon
were
rapidly
advancing
up
the
valley
lorenzo
felt
himself
trembling
he
wanted
to
scream
a
warning
have
to
reach
he
jerked
the
horse
to
a
stop
and
called
to
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
i
have
to
leave
you
lorenzo
rachel
eyes
were
huge
with
terror
he
took
her
hands
listen
i
love
you
like
my
own
daughter
but
i
have
just
seen
something
i
have
to
warn
them
daoud
david
will
be
killed
david
of
trebizond
said
friar
mathieu
you
called
him
daoud
the
old
priest
eyes
were
alight
with
sudden
understanding
never
mind
lorenzo
heard
his
own
voice
rising
in
panic
he
took
a
deep
breath
to
steady
himself
then
plunged
back
into
the
cart
and
seized
the
saddle
he
had
tucked
away
in
the
back
he
jumped
down
from
the
cart
unhitched
the
gelding
and
threw
the
saddle
over
its
back
oh
my
god
lorenzo
rachel
screamed
take
me
with
you
do
leave
me
here
i
will
be
back
for
you
he
said
as
he
fought
to
get
saddle
and
bridle
on
the
horse
i
swear
it
i
have
no
time
to
talk
i
have
to
do
this
wanting
something
more
than
a
dagger
to
defend
himself
with
he
grabbed
the
crossbow
he
had
taken
from
the
guard
at
the
tartar
tent
and
strapped
the
quiver
of
bolts
to
his
waist
the
gelding
expelled
a
breath
as
he
threw
himself
on
its
back
rachel
was
still
screaming
but
he
could
not
make
out
her
words
over
his
horse
hoofbeats
as
he
galloped
away
forgive
me
he
cried
over
his
shoulder
lxix
daoud
dark
brown
arabian
stallion
sidestepped
a
knot
of
fighting
men
daoud
heart
beat
slowly
and
heavily
in
his
chest
like
a
funeral
bell
the
field
was
still
a
chaos
the
battle
was
still
in
doubt
but
in
individual
combats
more
of
manfred
men
than
charles
were
falling
daoud
had
seen
and
it
had
made
him
almost
angry
enough
to
want
to
break
out
of
his
formation
and
pursue
them
a
group
of
apulian
crossbowmen
running
off
the
field
bands
of
charles
knights
were
getting
together
and
overwhelming
smaller
bands
of
manfred
it
was
the
power
of
christianity
daoud
thought
charles
men
had
been
told
by
the
pope
himself
that
they
were
crusaders
waging
a
holy
war
and
would
be
taken
up
into
heaven
if
they
died
in
battle
christian
warriors
had
been
excommunicated
without
the
sacraments
for
over
a
year
and
many
of
them
believed
that
if
they
were
killed
they
would
go
to
hell
daoud
could
not
be
sure
how
strongly
the
men
on
either
side
felt
about
these
things
but
it
could
be
enough
to
tilt
the
battle
slowly
in
charles
favor
on
manfred
side
the
only
ones
who
felt
they
were
waging
a
holy
war
were
the
sons
of
the
falcon
daoud
recalled
lorenzo
words
to
manfred
months
before
have
never
in
my
life
doubted
power
religion
manfred
himself
had
disappeared
into
one
of
these
whirlpools
of
combat
daoud
had
searched
everywhere
for
erhard
barth
who
should
be
pulling
manfred
army
together
and
giving
orders
if
manfred
would
not
do
it
himself
he
could
find
the
marshal
nowhere
there
were
no
plans
there
were
no
leaders
the
arabian
broad
back
rolled
easily
under
him
he
had
kept
the
sons
of
the
falcon
in
formation
ordering
them
to
advance
hoping
for
a
chance
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
staying
out
of
the
fighting
they
passed
moving
around
the
groups
of
struggling
men
and
reforming
ranks
was
frustrating
for
his
men
but
so
far
their
discipline
had
held
staying
together
had
protected
them
too
he
estimated
he
had
lost
only
about
twenty
men
so
far
music
familiar
martial
music
of
the
kind
he
had
often
heard
in
el
kahira
flared
up
behind
him
sending
a
thrill
up
his
spine
the
little
mounted
muslim
band
had
kept
pace
with
the
sons
of
the
falcon
he
and
the
sons
of
the
falcon
had
reached
the
midpoint
of
the
valley
benevento
behind
him
and
charles
camp
ahead
were
equally
distant
in
both
directions
the
sights
were
the
same
horsemen
flailing
at
each
other
with
swords
and
axes
and
maces
crossbowmen
and
pikemen
struggling
among
the
horses
legs
few
arrows
flew
now
because
an
archer
was
as
likely
as
not
to
hit
someone
on
his
own
side
daoud
narrowed
his
eyes
he
saw
again
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
the
brown
hill
a
bit
higher
than
any
near
it
the
cluster
of
men
on
horseback
sunlight
glittered
on
a
helmet
adorned
with
a
crown
he
felt
suddenly
lifted
up
he
wanted
to
laugh
aloud
of
the
worlds
you
have
shown
me
the
way
with
one
blow
they
could
end
the
battle
omar
his
second
in
command
rode
to
his
side
white
teeth
shining
in
his
thick
black
beard
daoud
pointed
up
the
valley
do
you
see
that
red
and
black
banner
and
that
group
of
knights
under
it
do
you
see
a
gold
crown
shining
on
a
helmet
that
is
charles
he
who
would
steal
our
lord
throne
i
see
him
emir
daoud
may
god
send
him
to
the
fire
whose
fuel
is
men
and
stones
may
we
be
permitted
to
help
god
send
charles
to
that
fire
there
is
nothing
between
him
and
us
but
men
fighting
one
another
and
a
line
of
foot
soldiers
we
can
sweep
away
with
our
arrows
i
see
my
lord
i
see
pass
the
order
to
charge
charge
at
the
red
and
black
banner
gladly
my
lord
death
to
charles
the
blue
flags
signal
for
a
charge
rose
and
waved
over
the
sons
of
the
falcon
daoud
felt
the
tension
build
in
the
men
riding
beside
him
he
unslung
his
turkish
bow
and
held
it
high
for
all
his
men
to
see
the
naqeeb
who
carried
the
banner
rode
out
before
them
holding
up
the
green
silk
with
its
verse
from
the
koran
yah
daoud
shouted
he
put
all
his
strength
all
his
will
into
the
cry
his
men
took
it
up
yah
allahu
akbar
he
brought
the
bow
down
to
his
side
the
blue
flags
dipped
the
kettledrums
rumbled
and
thundered
to
a
crescendo
the
trumpets
blared
he
drove
his
heels
hard
into
the
arabian
flanks
the
horse
catapulted
forward
instantly
throwing
daoud
back
against
his
saddle
he
leaned
into
the
cold
wind
squinting
his
eyes
against
the
rush
of
air
feeling
it
blow
through
his
beard
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
racing
beside
him
these
good
men
these
warriors
to
whom
he
had
taught
his
mameluke
skills
these
comrades
he
had
come
to
love
we
are
truly
sons
of
the
falcon
we
dive
to
kill
our
his
left
hand
held
the
reins
lightly
giving
the
horse
his
head
at
this
speed
he
had
to
trust
the
horse
to
find
the
way
they
were
partners
they
jumped
over
a
dead
crossbowman
they
leapt
a
great
fallen
frankish
charger
daoud
felt
as
if
he
had
wings
he
laughed
aloud
they
dodged
around
a
melee
he
rocked
to
the
jolting
as
the
horse
hooves
hit
the
ground
there
ahead
the
red
and
black
banner
planted
in
the
soil
of
the
hill
was
much
closer
daoud
could
clearly
make
out
the
black
rampant
lion
he
could
see
the
tall
man
wearing
a
cloak
and
the
helmet
with
the
gilded
crown
the
man
was
staring
this
way
perhaps
only
now
becoming
aware
of
his
danger
a
crossbow
bolt
hummed
viciously
past
daoud
ear
to
his
right
a
man
cried
out
and
fell
from
the
saddle
hamid
he
felt
a
moment
pain
no
time
for
fear
or
sorrow
he
crested
a
small
hill
and
saw
lines
of
crossbowmen
on
a
long
rise
of
ground
that
ran
across
the
valley
they
were
far
away
still
small
figures
but
growing
larger
as
daoud
galloped
on
they
were
turning
their
backs
having
just
fired
their
first
volley
had
hit
only
a
few
of
daoud
men
because
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
still
out
of
their
crossbows
short
range
facing
daoud
now
were
the
big
rectangular
shields
they
wore
on
their
backs
the
row
of
shields
leaned
away
from
him
as
the
men
bent
to
draw
their
bows
charles
and
the
men
around
him
were
gesturing
and
pointing
did
they
really
expect
these
archers
to
save
them
daoud
pulled
an
arrow
from
his
saddle
quiver
and
nocked
it
the
instant
they
turn
shoot
he
shouted
he
heard
his
order
echoed
as
the
word
was
passed
down
the
line
the
red
flags
went
up
he
took
aim
at
the
back
of
a
man
in
the
center
of
the
crossbowmen
line
the
archers
whirled
bringing
their
bows
up
the
red
flags
dipped
as
he
felt
his
galloping
horse
hooves
leave
the
ground
daoud
released
the
string
he
saw
the
man
he
had
targeted
drop
his
bow
and
fall
to
the
ground
the
falcons
arrows
swept
the
crossbowmen
like
a
scythe
the
powerful
turkish
bows
could
shoot
farther
and
be
reloaded
faster
than
the
european
weapons
the
few
archers
not
felled
by
their
volleys
ran
to
the
sides
of
the
valley
to
safety
charles
was
too
far
away
for
daoud
to
read
his
expression
but
his
arms
were
waving
frantically
as
if
he
were
trying
to
conjure
up
knights
out
of
thin
air
the
men
around
him
clutched
at
him
clearly
telling
him
they
must
ride
for
their
lives
one
of
charles
men
had
pulled
the
red
and
black
banner
out
of
the
ground
and
looked
ready
to
gallop
away
with
it
daoud
slung
his
bow
across
his
back
and
drew
his
long
curving
saif
from
the
scabbard
the
noonday
sun
flashed
on
it
as
he
held
it
high
his
men
roared
and
brandished
their
own
swords
the
band
had
caught
up
with
them
and
the
trumpets
and
hautboys
screamed
death
to
the
enemy
while
the
kettledrums
rumbled
there
was
nothing
left
to
protect
charles
now
there
was
not
even
time
for
the
french
leader
to
run
for
it
he
seemed
to
know
it
he
had
his
sword
out
and
he
held
up
a
white
shield
with
a
red
cross
urging
the
arabian
on
shouting
the
name
of
god
daoud
raced
toward
triumph
on
hands
and
knees
simon
stared
horrified
as
the
long
line
of
riders
charged
at
charles
position
the
saracen
riders
still
had
half
the
length
of
the
valley
to
cross
before
they
reached
charles
position
the
french
foot
archers
some
of
them
must
be
the
same
men
simon
had
briefly
commanded
before
the
gates
of
rome
were
lining
up
to
protect
their
king
there
was
time
but
very
little
god
have
mercy
exclaimed
antoine
de
la
durie
simon
backed
away
from
the
hilltop
stood
up
and
turned
all
down
the
side
of
the
ridge
hidden
from
the
valley
of
benevento
rows
of
knights
sat
on
their
great
horses
hefted
lances
thrust
at
the
air
with
their
swords
some
were
still
struggling
into
their
mail
shirts
with
the
help
of
their
equerries
hundreds
of
faces
looked
up
inquiringly
at
simon
trees
hid
the
rest
of
his
army
farther
down
the
slope
he
took
the
polished
helmet
valery
held
for
him
its
top
adorned
with
an
angry
griffin
spreading
its
wings
and
set
it
down
over
the
padded
arming
cap
that
held
it
in
place
de
la
durie
de
marion
de
puys
and
ten
more
barons
gathered
around
him
they
waited
silently
for
him
to
speak
he
was
shaking
inwardly
and
prayed
that
it
would
not
show
he
was
afraid
of
death
and
of
defeat
but
thank
god
he
was
no
longer
in
doubt
about
what
to
do
he
knew
over
a
hundred
saracens
are
about
to
fall
upon
king
charles
there
is
no
one
near
to
help
him
we
must
go
down
there
now
and
stop
them
straight
over
the
side
of
this
ridge
mount
your
horses
but
mercy
of
god

a
moment
king

mounting
the
huge
horse
he
set
his
foot
in
the
iron
stirrup
hoisted
himself
swung
his
leg
heavy
with
mail
over
the
saddle
and
settled
himself
he
drew
the
saracen
blade
roland
had
given
him
saracen
blade
to
fight
he
put
fear
and
doubt
out
of
his
mind
drew
a
deep
breath
and
roared
he
spurred
brillant
and
slapped
the
charger
neck
good
horse
find
a
way
down
then
he
had
plunged
over
the
edge
and
into
the
forest
on
the
other
side
he
crouched
hiding
his
face
behind
brillant
gray
neck
as
thick
as
a
tree
trunk
a
branch
struck
his
helmet
with
a
clang
stunning
him
slightly
and
he
bent
his
head
lower
twisted
trees
rushed
at
him
and
past
him
all
around
him
he
heard
men
shouting
some
yelling
in
wild
abandon
some
crying
out
in
fear
he
heard
a
terrible
crash
and
clatter
and
the
mingled
screams
of
a
man
and
a
horse
behind
him
came
a
thundering
like
a
landslide
as
more
and
more
of
his
knights
plunged
over
the
edge
of
the
ridge
he
had
time
to
think
in
jubilation
that
he
had
given
a
frightening
difficult
order
and
the
men
had
obeyed
hundreds
of
knights
and
were
plummeting
down
this
perilous
slope
because
he
had
told
them
to
i
die
today
i
die
a
but
would
they
reach
the
valley
in
time
to
save
charles
while
they
rushed
and
fell
and
fought
their
way
through
this
forest
that
battle
line
of
saracens
was
galloping
over
easy
rolling
ground
with
only
charles
archers
to
impede
them
just
now
simon
was
crashing
through
woods
so
thick
he
could
not
see
the
battlefield
then
there
was
light
ahead
and
a
meadow
of
brown
grass
brillant
broke
through
the
brush
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
the
line
was
a
little
past
the
place
where
simon
had
come
out
they
were
riding
those
light
fast
saracen
horses
where
were
the
lines
of
crossbowmen
gone
and
now
simon
saw
bodies
scattered
on
the
ground
where
the
foot
archers
had
stood
charles
banner
was
still
on
the
same
hilltop
in
moments
the
saracens
would
be
upon
him
faster
faster
simon
shouted
slapping
brillant
neck
as
the
huge
ran
at
top
speed
to
overtake
the
saracen
line
daoud
charged
on
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
crowned
figure
under
the
red
and
black
banner
the
pounding
of
hoofbeats
in
the
air
all
around
him
was
suddenly
louder
than
he
thought
possible
he
had
been
hearing
the
ululating
war
cries
of
his
men
but
now
heard
screams
of
pain
and
shouts
of
battle
and
deeper
war
cries
voices
shouting
in
french
coming
from
the
right
flank
he
turned
he
glimpsed
a
purple
banner
rushing
toward
him
a
white
and
red
banner
along
with
it
the
horse
beside
his
was
thrown
against
him
by
a
blow
that
all
but
knocked
him
senseless
caught
between
the
two
horses
flanks
his
right
leg
felt
as
if
it
were
being
crushed
as
pain
shot
up
into
his
hip
he
reeled
dizzily
in
the
saddle
and
clutched
the
reins
till
his
left
arm
ached
his
right
holding
his
saif
aloft
so
as
not
to
stab
one
of
his
own
men
his
horse
fell
against
the
one
on
his
other
side
all
around
him
horses
and
riders
were
thrown
to
the
ground
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
flung
about
wildly
their
forward
momentum
broken
by
some
unimaginable
force
that
had
hurled
itself
upon
them
at
the
sight
he
felt
a
giant
hand
reach
into
his
chest
and
tear
his
heart
out
the
sons
of
the
falcon
were
buried
under
an
avalanche
of
frankish
warriors
riding
huge
armored
god
my
god
why
are
you
doing
this
to
us
he
wanted
to
fling
himself
down
from
his
horse
and
smash
himself
on
the
ground
screaming
out
his
grief
in
an
instant
he
had
been
flung
from
joy
to
the
very
darkest
pit
of
despair
in
an
instant
he
saw
that
everything
was
lost
his
staring
eyes
were
dry
this
was
all
too
sudden
too
shocking
even
for
tears
where
had
these
devils
of
franks
come
from
down
out
of
the
hills
to
the
east
they
were
still
coming
hundreds
of
them
pouring
down
the
forested
slope
and
charging
over
the
level
ground
of
the
valley
broadswords
maces
battle
axes
rose
and
fell
their
war
shouts
filled
the
air
dieu
et
le
sepulcre
et
le
pape
le
roi
charles
he
saw
the
green
and
white
falcon
banner
go
down
he
heard
the
band
instruments
give
out
their
last
ugly
sounds
as
they
and
the
men
who
played
them
perished
under
maces
and
axes
he
saw
with
agony
the
deaths
of
men
he
had
trained
and
ridden
with
husain
said
farraj
omar
heads
smashed
bodies
cloven
he
felt
in
his
own
body
the
blows
that
killed
them
daoud
recognized
the
purple
banner
now
three
gold
crowns
he
had
seen
it
before
in
orvieto
simon
de
gobignon
had
come
at
last
to
this
battle
he
should
feel
hatred
for
de
gobignon
but
all
he
felt
was
a
numb
despair
his
few
remaining
men
crowded
against
him
forcing
him
to
fall
back
he
rode
back
toward
benevento
away
from
the
triumphant
army
of
gobignon
crushed
with
sorrow
the
sons
of
the
falcon
the
force
he
had
taken
a
year
to
build
had
been
destroyed
in
a
flicker
of
time
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
and
swallowed
them
lorenzo
wept
and
cursed
himself
for
being
too
late
to
warn
daoud
before
the
french
attacked
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
field
holding
his
horse
reins
in
one
hand
and
his
crossbow
in
the
other
watching
the
french
knights
sweep
across
the
valley
from
east
to
west
trampling
everyone
in
their
path
through
his
tears
he
saw
the
purple
and
gold
banner
of
gobignon
fluttering
against
the
cold
sky
de
gobignon
if
only
we
had
killed
him
in
all
about
him
men
rode
and
ran
and
fought
singly
and
in
twos
and
threes
horses
without
riders
ran
wildly
this
way
and
that
he
wondered
if
daoud
was
still
alive
what
had
happened
to
king
manfred
and
the
other
hohenstaufen
leaders
charles
still
occupied
his
hill
at
the
north
end
of
the
valley
almost
overwhelmed
at
the
moment
help
arrived
he
had
never
moved
there
were
fewer
and
fewer
of
manfred
men
in
sight
and
more
of
charles
with
their
accursed
red
crosses
a
line
of
about
a
dozen
horsemen
was
coming
toward
him
at
a
walk
most
of
them
wore
crosses
but
they
looked
like
neither
french
knights
nor
their
guelfo
allies
lorenzo
rubbed
his
eyes
to
clear
his
vision
of
tears
and
took
a
harder
look
two
men
rode
in
the
center
wearing
steel
helmets
and
gleaming
gray
mail
shirts
without
surcoats
they
held
short
heavy
bows
in
their
hands
the
brims
of
their
helmets
shaded
their
faces
but
lorenzo
could
tell
that
their
skin
was
browner
than
any
frank
or
italian
the
men
flanking
them
on
either
side
wore
conical
helmets
and
what
seemed
to
be
leather
breastplates
and
carried
long
curving
sabers
bows
were
slung
over
their
shoulders
one
man
on
the
right
end
of
the
line
was
dressed
in
a
steel
cuirass
lorenzo
realized
that
he
was
seeing
the
tartars
and
their
armenian
bodyguards
and
the
man
with
the
steel
breastplate
was
sordello
at
the
sight
of
the
old
bravo
lorenzo
felt
fury
boiling
in
him
back
in
orvieto
that
man
had
deserted
daoud
and
him
despite
that
daoud
had
sent
him
money
through
ugolini
in
perugia
and
viterbo
and
sordello
had
sent
them
snippets
of
information
but
lorenzo
had
privately
vowed
that
the
next
time
he
saw
sordello
he
would
squash
him
like
a
bedbug
and
now
he
appeared
again
just
after
simon
de
gobignon
smashed
daoud
final
hope
of
victory
the
tartars
talked
and
gestured
to
each
other
surveying
the
battlefield
their
attention
and
that
of
their
guards
was
on
a
melee
that
was
rolling
rapidly
toward
them
a
boiling
mass
of
horsemen
the
survivors
of
daoud
sons
of
the
falcon
battling
with
the
vanguard
of
the
frankish
knights
was
struggling
its
way
to
the
western
side
of
the
valley
partly
hidden
from
the
approaching
tartars
by
his
horse
lorenzo
readied
his
crossbow
he
hooked
the
bowstring
to
his
belt
and
put
his
right
foot
in
the
stirrup
in
front
of
the
bow
he
kicked
out
sharply
straightening
his
right
leg
and
the
bowstring
snapped
into
place
behind
the
catch
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
kill
sordello
but
his
first
duty
was
to
kill
the
tartars
and
thus
he
would
pay
the
french
back
for
daoud
defeat
this
would
be
much
more
satisfying
than
leaving
poisoned
wine
in
their
tent
he
raised
the
bow
loaded
a
bolt
and
stepped
out
into
the
path
you
little
monsters
he
shouted
the
younger
tartar
philip
brought
his
head
up
giving
lorenzo
an
even
better
shot
lorenzo
depressed
the
catch
and
the
bolt
smashed
into
the
center
of
philip
chest
right
through
the
mail
shirt
his
eyes
huge
philip
fell
out
of
the
saddle
his
frightened
horse
galloped
away
lorenzo
ducked
back
and
bent
to
draw
his
bow
a
moment
later
something
hit
the
side
of
his
horse
and
the
animal
gave
an
agonized
whinny
and
fell
to
its
knees
by
that
time
lorenzo
had
his
bow
cocked
and
loaded
again
he
rose
up
from
behind
his
dying
horse
john
was
just
drawing
his
bow
for
a
second
shot
for
rachel
lorenzo
called
and
shot
john
in
the
same
place
he
had
hit
philip
the
center
of
the
chest
the
force
of
the
bolt
knocked
john
backward
john
toppled
from
his
horse
and
slid
to
the
ground
he
cried
out
some
words
in
his
tartar
language
shivered
and
lay
still
lorenzo
stood
a
moment
breathing
heavily
he
felt
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
who
has
done
a
hard
job
that
he
had
long
wanted
to
complete
there
was
no
satisfied
no
gloating
over
vengeance
achieved
it
was
just
the
good
feeling
of
an
archer
whose
arrows
had
gone
true
kill
him
sordello
shouted
the
armenians
and
sordello
thundered
down
upon
him
lorenzo
set
the
crossbow
stirrup
on
the
ground
and
put
his
foot
into
it
but
he
knew
he
would
not
have
time
for
another
shot
he
tensed
himself
for
the
bite
of
those
saber
blades
into
his
unarmored
body
then
like
a
curtain
the
fleeing
remnant
of
the
sons
of
the
falcon
and
the
french
knights
in
pursuit
on
their
gigantic
horses
swept
between
lorenzo
and
the
tartars
guards
still
clutching
the
crossbow
he
ran
a
bay
arabian
horse
riderless
its
eyes
rolling
in
frenzy
galloped
toward
him
lorenzo
threw
down
the
crossbow
and
sprang
into
the
path
spreading
his
arms
wide
the
horse
tried
to
dodge
around
him
but
lorenzo
grabbed
the
reins
dug
his
heels
in
and
jerked
the
horse
to
a
stop
he
spoke
soothingly
and
rubbed
its
head
and
when
it
was
calm
enough
he
scooped
up
his
weapon
and
heaved
himself
into
the
saddle
he
felt
a
grim
satisfaction
at
having
killed
the
tartars
but
it
was
too
late
and
not
enough
daoud
brave
attempt
to
finish
charles
had
been
smashed
and
the
battle
was
all
but
lost
he
must
get
back
to
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
if
out
of
this
tragedy
he
could
rescue
rachel
that
at
least
would
be
something
striking
right
and
left
with
his
saif
daoud
hammered
on
lifted
shields
on
mailed
arms
on
helmets
on
longswords
few
of
his
blows
did
damage
but
they
forced
a
way
for
himself
and
his
horse
through
the
ring
of
frenchmen
surrounding
manfred
defenders
mustached
faces
blind
with
fury
thrust
themselves
at
him
and
he
struck
at
them
with
fist
and
shield
and
sword
he
drove
his
horse
into
a
narrow
space
between
the
rumps
of
two
huge
destriers
pushed
them
apart
like
samson
bringing
down
the
temple
of
the
philistines
and
was
facing
one
of
his
own
sons
of
the
falcon
a
man
with
blood
and
dirt
smeared
over
his
black
beard
ahmad
make
way
for
me
my
lord
i
thought
you
were
dead
ahmad
nudged
his
horse
to
one
side
enough
to
let
daoud
through
and
then
with
his
lance
drove
back
the
french
knight
who
tried
to
follow
him
past
ahmad
daoud
looked
about
and
saw
that
manfred
surviving
warriors
had
formed
a
large
irregular
ring
facing
an
press
of
crusaders
more
of
manfred
followers
were
crowded
inside
the
circle
he
saw
some
men
move
out
and
join
those
fighting
the
french
while
others
fell
back
and
took
a
brief
respite
many
dead
men
lay
on
the
ground
and
many
wounded
who
were
too
badly
hurt
to
stand
the
wounded
who
remained
on
their
feet
were
still
fighting
daoud
saw
with
a
pang
of
sorrow
that
there
among
the
dead
lay
erhard
barth
the
landgrave
at
least
manfred
marshal
had
died
fighting
for
his
master
and
would
not
have
to
live
with
the
memory
of
defeat
the
trampled
brown
earth
within
this
ring
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
hohenstaufen
kingdom
daoud
anger
was
deep
and
weary
at
himself
for
failing
and
at
the
fate
that
had
destroyed
his
hopes
today
this
morning
he
thought
he
had
imagined
himself
feeling
like
baibars
at
the
well
of
goliath
now
he
knew
how
ket
bogha
must
have
felt
does
god
test
us
so
heavily
he
looked
for
the
helmet
he
had
seen
from
a
distance
telling
him
manfred
was
here
there
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
ring
of
knights
with
tattered
cloaks
and
surcoats
manfred
young
poets
and
musicians
it
made
daoud
heavy
heart
feel
a
little
lighter
to
see
that
they
had
stuck
by
their
king
he
steered
his
horse
over
to
manfred
emir
daoud
and
still
on
your
horse
the
face
under
the
bronzed
helmet
was
red
and
shiny
with
sweat
manfred
expression
and
voice
were
cheerful
but
daoud
saw
a
deep
haunting
anguish
in
his
eyes
this
is
my
fourth
horse
of
the
day
sire
daoud
climbed
down
and
bent
his
knee
to
press
manfred
hand
against
his
forehead
i
had
heard
you
were
killed
that
new
french
army
that
came
at
noon
overran
us
no
need
to
tell
manfred
if
he
did
not
know
how
close
they
had
come
to
winning
sire
we
have
enough
horses
and
men
to
break
out
of
here
manfred
shook
his
head
nothing
is
left
for
me
except
to
decide
how
the
minnesingers
will
remember
me
after
this
day
to
fall
in
battle
will
be
far
better
surely
than
whatever
shameful
end
charles
might
be
planning
for
me
but
you
need
not
fall
into
anjou
hands
daoud
insisted
there
is
nowhere
for
me
to
escape
to
said
manfred
i
have
lost
all
my
fighting
men
all
my
kingdom
lies
open
to
charles
sultan
baibars
would
receive
you
as
a
revered
guest
or
the
emperor
of
constantinople
we
could
take
sophia
there
with
manfred
shook
his
head
with
a
rueful
smile
i
would
be
honored
to
eat
your
sultan
bread
and
salt
or
to
visit
that
wonderful
city
constantinople
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
the
shambles
anjou
makes
of
this
land
my
father
and
i
labored
so
many
years
to
make
beautiful
and
i
have
been
a
king
and
i
do
not
want
to
end
my
life
as
an
exile
we
are
all
daoud
thought
manfred
continued
i
thank
you
for
all
your
help
daoud
you
must
get
away
while
you
still
have
a
chance
tears
burning
his
eyes
daoud
saw
that
the
little
space
manfred
men
defended
had
shrunk
even
as
they
spoke
he
thought
of
sophia
waiting
for
him
in
benevento
he
thought
of
el
kahira
of
blossoming
reed
of
going
before
baibars
and
telling
him
he
had
failed
to
stop
the
alliance
of
tartars
and
christians
he
would
never
see
any
of
them
again
he
closed
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
sat
in
the
gray
mosque
and
heard
the
voice
of
sheikh
saadi
warrior
of
god
is
known
not
by
his
willingness
to
kill
but
by
his
willingness
to
die
he
is
a
man
who
would
give
his
life
for
his
he
looked
again
at
the
short
smiling
man
before
him
and
said
i
will
stay
with
you
manfred
put
out
a
hand
daoud
you
owe
me
no
blood
loyalty
i
do
not
ask
you
to
die
in
my
company
and
yet
but
for
my
advice
you
might
not
be
here
today
daoud
said
i
owe
you
that
i
can
not
leave
you
many
of
my
own
men
already
have
then
i
must
stay
manfred
looked
deep
into
daoud
eyes
what
about
sophia
daoud
sighed
god
knows
how
much
i
wish
i
were
with
sophia
right
now
but
she
is
the
most
resourceful
woman
i
have
ever
known
and
she
has
friends
with
her
in
benevento
and
i
have
always
known
i
could
never
take
her
back
to
el
kahira
if
i
live
there
is
no
other
place
i
can
go
but
el
kahira
it
is
torment
for
me
to
think
i
will
never
see
her
again
but
whatever
happens
to
me
sophia
and
i
would
have
to
part
perhaps
it
is
best
that
we
be
parted
this
way
manfred
gripped
daoud
arms
hard
stay
then
and
be
welcome
among
my
companions
have
brought
destruction
and
death
to
so
daoud
thought
is
the
time
to
the
company
and
the
ground
they
defended
grew
steadily
smaller
as
the
sun
sank
toward
the
west
side
of
the
valley
even
knowing
that
every
moment
he
fought
was
another
infinitely
precious
moment
of
life
daoud
felt
a
leaden
weariness
that
made
him
wish
the
battle
might
soon
end
he
struck
out
with
his
nicked
and
blunted
saif
against
yet
another
french
knight
who
seemed
fresh
and
full
of
vigor
while
pain
screamed
in
his
own
shoulders
and
his
legs
felt
ready
to
give
way
under
him
but
there
were
no
respites
now
all
manfred
men
still
on
their
feet
were
fighting
all
their
horses
were
fled
from
the
field
or
dead
daoud
reminded
himself
that
when
this
battle
ended
he
would
be
dead
and
he
thrust
upward
with
his
saif
to
parry
a
longsword
whose
arc
would
have
ended
in
his
skull
manfred
was
swinging
his
sword
beside
him
by
fighting
daoud
thought
they
held
off
not
only
their
enemies
but
the
despair
that
he
felt
like
a
dark
tide
within
him
and
that
he
knew
manfred
must
feel
too
he
wondered
whether
lorenzo
had
gotten
through
to
the
tartars
and
killed
them
and
if
he
had
would
it
make
a
difference
a
french
knight
with
huge
mustaches
that
disappeared
under
the
sides
of
his
helmet
swung
a
battle
axe
and
the
muslim
warrior
standing
next
to
daoud
was
suddenly
headless
a
spray
of
blood
splashed
on
daoud
he
saw
mounted
knights
pushing
through
the
mass
of
shouting
frenchmen
one
on
his
right
wore
a
helmet
and
brandished
a
mace
on
his
left
rode
a
knight
whose
helmet
was
adorned
with
some
fantastic
winged
animal
surrender
the
knight
with
the
beast
on
his
helmet
shouted
you
have
fought
bravely
the
battle
is
over
you
will
have
good
terms
daoud
had
just
time
to
recognize
the
face
under
the
helmet
with
a
strange
feeling
of
gladness
as
if
meeting
an
old
friend
simon
de
gobignon
not
till
i
have
crushed
the
viper
and
that
coming
from
the
red
helmet
that
covered
his
face
was
the
deep
voice
of
cardinal
paulus
de
verceuil
all
in
red
he
loomed
over
the
struggle
like
a
tower
of
fire
so
hard
did
he
drive
his
charger
through
his
own
french
knights
that
some
of
them
were
knocked
to
the
ground
daoud
even
saw
one
fall
under
the
hooves
of
the
cardinal
horse
others
scrambled
out
of
the
way
the
cardinal
reared
up
over
manfred
hooves
flailing
manfred
dodged
back
the
hooves
came
down
and
the
charger
leapt
forward
leaning
out
of
the
saddle
holding
the
mace
in
both
hands
de
verceuil
brought
it
down
on
manfred
helmet
no
daoud
screamed
he
heard
a
metallic
crash
manfred
collapsed
to
the
ground
with
a
jangle
of
mail
and
lay
still
blood
streaked
his
yellow
and
black
surcoat
and
soaked
the
crushed
green
plume
with
a
cry
of
rage
daoud
threw
himself
at
de
verceuil
to
drag
him
off
his
horse
he
was
knocked
aside
by
a
great
gray
charger
that
forced
its
way
between
himself
and
the
cardinal
staggering
back
he
looked
up
into
the
face
of
simon
de
gobignon
no
cardinal
de
gobignon
shouted
you
will
not
kill
this
man
too
before
he
has
had
the
chance
of
honorable
surrender
amazed
daoud
let
his
saif
drop
a
bit
de
gobignon
had
ridden
in
not
to
attack
him
but
to
save
him
from
de
verceuil
all
he
accomplished
was
to
save
de
verceuil
from
de
gobignon
leaning
down
from
his
gray
charger
pointed
his
curving
sword
at
daoud
but
not
in
a
threatening
way
daoud
took
a
step
backward
his
saif
lifted
the
struggle
around
them
had
stopped
the
fighting
men
had
fallen
silent
the
handful
of
manfred
followers
remaining
were
quietly
laying
down
their
arms
a
german
knight
and
a
saracen
crouched
weeping
over
manfred
body
daoud
arms
and
legs
felt
as
if
he
were
pushing
them
through
water
but
he
knew
that
if
he
began
to
fight
again
he
would
forget
this
weariness
the
worst
of
what
he
felt
was
the
terrible
ache
of
grief
in
his
chest
grief
for
manfred
for
threatened
islam
for
sophia
look
at
him
look
at
his
garb
said
de
verceuil
a
saracen
with
the
face
of
a
frank
if
he
surrenders
he
should
be
burned
as
an
apostate
you
must
be
blind
indeed
cardinal
said
de
gobignon
if
you
do
not
see
who
this
is
he
turned
to
daoud
with
a
grave
face
you
are
david
of
trebizond
i
am
said
daoud
and
are
you
truly
a
saracen
i
have
long
thought
that
you
were
an
agent
of
manfred
but
i
never
would
have
guessed
to
look
at
you
that
you
were
a
follower
of
mohammed
you
were
meant
not
to
think
that
this
battle
this
war
is
over
now
i
give
you
my
word
that
if
you
surrender
you
will
be
treated
honorably
there
will
be
no
burning
de
verceuil
boomed
count
you
can
not
promise
that
i
do
promise
it
the
two
christian
warriors
on
horseback
faced
each
other
the
count
in
purple
and
the
cardinal
in
red
looking
almost
as
if
they
might
fall
to
fighting
you
need
not
argue
daoud
said
i
will
not
surrender
de
gobignon
stared
at
him
you
will
be
throwing
your
life
away
no
said
daoud
i
am
giving
my
life
to
god
he
could
not
help
anyone
now
not
manfred
not
baibars
not
sophia
like
manfred
he
had
only
one
choice
left
to
him
the
manner
of
his
death
very
well
messer
david
said
the
young
count
he
swung
himself
down
from
his
charger
at
his
gesture
one
of
his
men
pulled
the
horse
away
monseigneur
a
young
man
called
from
the
circle
of
frenchmen
that
surrounded
them
victory
is
already
ours
do
risk
your
life
to
fight
one
saracen
i
am
the
count
de
gobignon
said
simon
quietly
because
i
uphold
the
honor
of
my
house
de
gobignon
turned
to
de
verceuil
who
still
sat
on
his
horse
holding
his
bloody
mace
in
his
hand
kindly
clear
the
field
cardinal
i
shall
see
that
you
have
the
last
sacraments
if
the
infidel
kills
you
said
de
verceuil
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
he
yanked
his
head
around
drove
his
spurs
deep
and
rode
off
the
circle
of
men
on
foot
parting
for
him
daoud
gazed
at
the
young
man
before
him
with
a
feeling
that
was
very
like
love
he
had
once
hated
simon
de
gobignon
now
he
felt
him
almost
a
son
or
a
younger
brother
or
another
self
if
he
had
ever
wanted
to
be
someone
like
simon
he
did
not
now
he
had
penetrated
such
mysteries
and
known
such
ecstasies
as
de
gobignon
never
would
he
had
heard
and
heeded
the
words
of
the
prophet
may
god
commend
and
salute
him
he
had
served
baibars
and
been
taught
by
sheikh
saadi
and
imam
fayum
he
had
fought
for
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
and
had
loved
sophia
karaiannides
and
soon
he
would
stand
with
god
in
paradise
i
do
not
challenge
your
honor
he
said
the
frenchman
was
already
moving
into
a
combat
stance
a
slight
crouch
an
exploratory
circling
of
the
tip
of
his
sword
but
even
so
i
fight
for
my
honor
simon
said
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
whom
you
are
fighting
daoud
said
raising
his
saif
i
am
emir
daoud
ibn
abdallah
of
the
bhari
mamelukes
mameluke
said
de
gobignon
softly
i
have
heard
that
word
you
shall
learn
what
it
means
said
daoud
he
did
not
want
to
kill
de
gobignon
but
he
would
if
he
had
to
because
the
young
man
deserved
nothing
less
than
the
best
fight
of
which
he
was
capable
they
moved
slowly
around
each
other
under
that
purple
and
gold
surcoat
the
frenchman
was
wearing
mail
armor
from
his
toes
to
his
fingertips
a
hood
of
mail
left
only
his
face
bare
and
his
helmet
with
its
nasal
bar
covered
part
of
his
face
in
this
kind
of
fight
the
greater
speed
of
a
lightly
armored
fighter
was
not
much
advantage
the
weight
of
the
mail
might
slow
de
gobignon
down
a
bit
but
fatigue
would
do
the
same
for
daoud
the
scimitar
de
gobignon
wielded
that
souvenir
stolen
from
some
islamic
warrior
looked
to
be
at
least
as
good
a
blade
as
the
one
daoud
was
using
the
count
sprang
and
slashed
at
daoud
arm
daoud
stepped
back
easily
and
parried
the
blow
can
cut
my
hand
off
and
that
would
end
the
fight
and
i
might
even
survive
the
loss
of
a
hand
to
be
taken
prisoner
into
the
bargain
i
must
not
let
that
with
a
shout
daoud
drove
the
point
of
his
saif
straight
at
de
face
christians
used
swords
for
chopping
not
stabbing
with
a
backhanded
slash
de
gobignon
knocked
the
point
aside
he
punched
with
his
mailed
free
hand
at
daoud
chest
armor
daoud
felt
the
force
of
the
blow
but
he
saw
de
gobignon
wince
a
mailed
fist
could
hurt
flesh
but
when
it
struck
metal
the
fist
would
suffer
daoud
slashed
at
de
gobignon
sword
arm
just
above
the
elbow
us
see
if
that
mail
can
withstand
my
de
gobignon
winced
again
but
the
saif
rebounded
without
cutting
through
the
chain
links
and
daoud
felt
a
jolt
in
his
gauntleted
hand
sword
is
good
but
so
is
the
mail
i
can
not
cut
it
or
stab
through
de
gobignon
rushed
him
suddenly
swinging
wildly
lips
drawn
back
from
clenched
teeth
daoud
danced
away
a
part
of
his
mind
pleased
that
he
could
move
so
quickly
when
he
had
to
tired
as
he
was
de
wild
swings
from
side
to
side
left
his
chest
exposed
he
was
relying
entirely
on
his
armor
daoud
saw
to
protect
him
daoud
jabbed
de
gobignon
under
the
armpit
so
hard
that
he
felt
the
flexible
metal
of
his
saif
bend
again
the
blade
failed
to
penetrate
the
tightly
woven
chain
mail
but
de
gobignon
gave
a
gasp
of
pain
and
cut
his
attack
short
daoud
was
gratified
he
glimpsed
a
familiar
face
in
the
circle
of
onlookers
a
meaty
face
with
a
broken
nose
sordello
had
he
been
guarding
the
tartars
on
the
field
today
de
gobignon
attacked
again
swinging
his
scimitar
furiously
at
head
he
ended
the
motion
with
his
arm
across
his
face
daoud
gripped
his
own
sword
with
both
hands
and
on
de
gobignon
backswing
raised
it
over
his
head
and
brought
it
down
with
all
his
strength
on
the
frenchman
wrist
the
count
arm
was
moving
into
the
blow
which
gave
it
even
more
force
the
scimitar
flew
from
de
gobignon
hand
daoud
threw
his
body
against
de
gobignon
and
locked
his
foot
behind
his
opponent
ankle
his
long
thin
frame
in
his
mail
de
gobignon
fell
over
backward
daoud
stepped
forward
instantly
groans
and
cries
of
horror
were
already
going
up
from
the
frenchmen
in
the
ring
around
them
daoud
planted
his
foot
on
de
gobignon
chest
hard
enough
to
knock
the
wind
out
of
him
he
jabbed
his
saif
straight
at
one
of
de
gobignon
few
vulnerable
places
his
right
eye
stopping
the
point
a
finger
breadth
from
the
pupil
daoud
and
de
gobignon
remained
frozen
that
way
now
o
god
tell
me
what
will
i
do
with
him
a
year
ago
he
would
have
joyfully
driven
the
point
of
the
saif
into
simon
de
gobignon
brain
even
now
he
reminded
himself
that
to
kill
de
gobignon
would
relieve
islam
of
a
most
dangerous
enemy
daoud
would
have
won
the
battle
for
manfred
today
and
manfred
would
still
be
alive
were
it
not
for
de
gobignon
unexpected
charge
for
that
alone
the
young
count
deserved
to
die
de
gobignon
lay
motionless
his
face
full
of
anger
and
defiance
what
a
waste
i
will
kill
him
the
other
franks
will
kill
me
and
both
of
us
will
be
dead
all
loss
no
the
sun
hurt
his
eyes
it
was
low
in
the
west
almost
touching
the
hills
that
bounded
the
valley
of
benevento
if
i
spare
him
the
franks
will
not
let
me
live
for
what
i
have
been
for
what
i
have
done
to
them
they
will
burn
me
as
de
verceuil
said
or
worse
could
i
trade
simon
life
for
a
decent
death
for
myself
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
a
crushing
blow
to
his
chest
jolted
his
body
throwing
him
back
he
heard
the
clang
of
metal
punching
through
his
chest
armor
an
instant
later
a
thunderbolt
of
pain
struck
just
beneath
his
ribs
and
spread
through
his
body
he
cried
out
in
agony
somewhere
nearby
a
woman
voice
screamed
he
sank
to
his
knees
dazed
happened
to
me
he
still
had
his
sword
in
his
hand
in
his
blurred
vision
he
saw
de
gobignon
his
mouth
open
in
surprise
sitting
up
crawling
toward
him
warningly
he
raised
his
saif
but
the
terrible
pain
in
the
middle
of
his
body
drained
the
strength
from
his
hand
and
the
sword
fell
from
his
fingers
to
the
ground
help
me
i
have
been
i
am
going
to
fear
worse
than
he
had
ever
felt
turned
his
body
to
ice
so
total
was
its
power
over
him
that
the
fear
became
a
greater
enemy
than
death
itself
and
he
gathered
his
forces
to
put
it
down
after
a
moment
of
struggle
though
he
still
quaked
inwardly
he
began
to
take
command
of
himself
de
gobignon
was
looking
down
at
him
and
his
face
was
full
of
shock
and
grief
someone
else
was
standing
over
him
he
saw
a
pair
of
leather
leggings
tucked
into
heavy
boots
archer
dress
his
head
fell
back
and
he
was
looking
up
at
sordello
the
bravo
squatted
down
bringing
his
face
close
to
daoud
i
am
glad
to
see
you
still
alive
messer
david
he
said
in
a
soft
grating
voice
so
i
can
tell
you
that
this
repays
you
for
teaching
me
about
paradise
the
pain
felt
as
if
rats
had
burrowed
into
his
chest
and
were
eating
their
way
out
he
wanted
to
scream
but
he
managed
to
smile
thank
you
sordello
you
are
sending
me
to
the
true
paradise
there
was
justice
in
it
he
had
forced
sordello
to
undergo
the
hashishiyya
initiation
he
had
always
felt
that
an
evil
thing
to
do
now
he
was
repaid
just
as
sordello
said
when
i
die
god
will
welcome
a
hand
clamped
on
sordello
shoulder
and
jerked
him
away
you
filthy
stinking
cowardly
bastard
you
killed
the
best
man
on
this
field
daoud
could
not
see
sordello
but
he
could
picture
the
expression
that
went
with
the
injured
tone
your
signory
i
save
your
life
and
you
call
me
a
bastard
the
point
of
his
sword
right
at
your
eyeball
he
was
not
going
to
kill
me
i
could
see
it
in
his
face
there
was
a
wild
almost
frightened
note
in
sordello
laughter
can
your
signory
read
men
thoughts
i
warrant
you
if
you
had
till
the
day
of
judgment
you
could
not
guess
what
this
archfiend
is
thinking
you
have
no
idea
what
he
has
done
daoud
almost
managed
to
laugh
the
fool
sordello
as
usual
speaking
and
acting
before
he
thought
one
word
more
and
he
would
indeed
hang
himself
tell
the
count
sordello
tell
him
what
i
have
done
i
will
forgive
you
for
making
me
suffer
so
if
you
will
let
me
see
sordello
face
just
and
god
granted
daoud
wish
sordello
crouched
again
over
daoud
his
color
maroon
his
bloodshot
eyes
popping
it
was
wonderful
and
daoud
breathed
a
prayer
of
thanks
after
a
moment
sordello
got
control
of
himself
enough
to
speak
you
know
what
you
have
done
you
killed
the
tartars
he
straightened
up
your
signory
do
you
not
know
that
john
and
philip
are
dead
and
it
was
this
man
servant
giancarlo
who
shot
them
from
ambush
with
a
crossbow
on
the
battlefield
i
shot
this
david
of
trebizond
not
only
to
save
your
life
but
to
avenge
the
tartars

away
beating
his
mailed
fist
against
his
leg
god

god
two
years
i
kept
them
alive
and
anjou
them
the
count
was
silent
for
a
long
moment
his
back
remained
turned
but
his
shoulders
heaved
he
seemed
to
be
sobbing
daoud
glanced
at
sordello
whose
eyes
glowed
with
triumphant
hatred
lorenzo
finished
the
tartars
at
last
i
pray
only
that
it
is
not
too
he
felt
not
elation
but
a
quiet
satisfaction
he
thanked
god
for
letting
him
hear
this
news
before
he
died
did
you
get
giancarlo
de
gobignon
asked
in
a
quiet
choked
voice
no
your
signory

battle
came
between
us
daoud
thought
you
o
god

away
sordello
said
de
gobignon
in
that
same
subdued
tone
go
where
i
can
not
see
you

will
deal
with
you
later

signory
this
man
is
capable
of
the
most
unbelievable
treachery

the
moments
of
life
he
has
left
to
him
god
alone

what
evil
he
may

i
urge
you
kill
him
at
once
it
is
the
wisest
thing
here
here
is
my
dagger

his
throat

john
and
philip
and
yourself
or
let
me
do
it
for
you
do
not
soil
your
hands
is
terrified
of
what
i
might
say
about
in
his
dimming
vision
daoud
saw
sordello
lunge
at
him
holding
a
long
dagger
suddenly
he
vanished
a
moment
later
daoud
heard
a
crash
i
told
you
de
gobignon
said
get
out
of
my
sight
for
a
short
time
daoud
could
see
no
one
he
heard
movements
and
murmurings
around
him
then
he
felt
a
hand
slide
under
his
head
and
lift
it
up
a
fresh
wave
of
pain
swept
through
his
body
shocking
him
with
its
force
he
thought
he
had
already
felt
the
worst
he
cried
aloud
in
the
hour
when
i
need
it
most
i
had
almost
forgotten
he
pictured
the
drug
collecting
in
his
head
and
coursing
in
a
stream
of
glowing
silver
down
his
throat
and
branching
out
to
all
parts
of
his
body
cooling
soothing
building
a
wall
around
the
place
down
low
on
the
right
side
of
his
chest
where
the
crossbow
bolt
had
driven
into
him
a
silver
globe
formed
around
the
pain
and
he
was
able
to
think
and
speak
he
felt
that
his
head
was
lying
on
something
soft
kneeling
on
his
left
side
de
gobignon
said
i
am
sorry
i
hurt
you
i
folded
my
cloak
and
put
it
under
you
to
try
to
make
you
more
comfortable
thank
you
i
feel
better
now
are
you
really
a
muslim
can
you
talk
or
is
it
too
painful
i
can
talk
i
would
be
glad
to
know
who
and
what
you
really
are
and
i
will
gladly
tell
you
daoud
began
to
feel
death
creeping
through
his
limbs
the
pain
was
sealed
off
but
he
sensed
the
lower
cavities
of
his
body
filling
up
with
blood
the
crossbow
bolt
should
have
gone
right
through
him
but
the
rear
half
of
his
breastplate
must
have
stopped
it
fear
began
to
rise
in
him
again
fear
and
a
desolating
sorrow
never
to
see
sophia
again
never
to
do
even
the
simplest
things
get
up
and
walk
see
breathe
it
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
fought
to
find
his
balance
can
not
save
myself
from
dying
but
i
can
decide
how
i
will
use
these
last
moments
of
he
wanted
to
tell
this
man
who
had
been
his
greatest
enemy
all
along
how
he
had
tricked
him
and
how
close
he
had
come
to
thwarting
their
grand
design
of
an
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
to
destroy
islam
it
would
make
up
in
a
small
way
for
all
today
defeats
for
himself
that
was
all
he
wanted
now
very
soon
now
he
would
go
up
to
paradise
but
sophia
and
lorenzo
ugolini
and
tilia
would
have
to
struggle
on
in
this
world
after
he
was
gone
he
must
protect
them
tell
me
simon
prompted
my
father
was
the
sire
geoffrey
langmuir
of
ascalon
he
began
my
mother
was
lady
evelyn
he
told
de
gobignon
of
his
capture
by
the
army
of
egypt
his
rearing
as
a
mameluke
in
a
barracks
on
the
nile
he
tried
to
explain
what
a
mameluke
was
and
what
code
he
lived
by
he
told
of
his
acceptance
of
islam
his
first
battles
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
wandered
and
he
saw
the
red
sun
half
hidden
by
the
wooded
western
hills
he
felt
the
air
growing
colder
and
he
shivered
the
chill
was
not
in
the
air
alone
his
arms
and
legs
were
numb
as
if
they
were
freezing
give
me
your
cloak
valery
de
gobignon
said
and
in
a
moment
a
red
cloak
was
being
spread
over
him
you
were
at
mansura
where
my
father
fought
de
gobignon
said
it
was
a
great
victory
for
islam
said
daoud
i
saw
only
a
little
fighting
i
was
very
young
he
told
how
baibars
had
entrusted
him
with
more
and
more
important
tasks
even
with
the
killing
of
qutuz
and
how
at
last
having
trained
and
shaped
him
over
the
years
baibars
sent
him
against
the
powers
of
europe
cardinal
ugolini
took
a
muslim
agent
into
his
house
introduced
you
to
the
holy
father
pope
himself
by
god
breath
he
must
be
careful
and
protect
his
onetime
protector
and
others
it
was
king
manfred
who
sent
me
to
ugolini
daoud
managed
to
laugh
do
you
think
poor
cardinal
ugolini
would
be
mad
enough
to
present
me
to
the
pope
if
he
had
known
that
i
was
a
muslim
a
mameluke
i
suppose
not
said
the
count
daoud
focused
his
wandering
eyes
on
the
pale
face
with
its
sharp
features
that
hovered
over
him
de
mouth
was
open
working
he
was
afraid
of
what
daoud
might
answer
and
sophia
how
much
did
she
know
about
you
she
knew
nothing
she
knows
nothing
even
now
she
was
more
useful
to
us
that
way
sophia
was
probably
still
in
benevento
waiting
for
him
charles
army
must
be
moving
on
benevento
to
occupy
it
there
would
be
murder
and
rape
and
looting
there
this
night
if
de
gobignon
still
believed
in
sophia
and
loved
her
he
would
try
to
protect
her
there
was
pain
in
de
gobignon
eyes
useful
to
you
yes
we
let
her
encourage
you
we
let
her
fall
in
love
with
you
he
watched
de
gobignon
color
grow
warmer
pinker
as
he
absorbed
what
daoud
was
saying
each
time
she
saw
you
ugolini
would
question
her
afterward
as
if
worried
about
her
virtue
you
told
her
more
than
you
realized
she
told
ugolini
more
than
she
realized
did
question
her
de
gobignon
fixed
his
eyes
on
daoud
i
spoke
very
little
with
her
i
did
not
want
her
to
suspect
me
me
sophia
for
denying
our
love
i
do
it
to
save
your
where
can
i
find
sophia
perhaps
you
can
help
her
she
is
in
benevento
she
came
with
her
uncle
daoud
managed
a
smile
he
thought
manfred
was
going
to
force
the
pope
to
reinstate
him
where
in
benevento
on
a
narrow
street
that
runs
south
from
the
roman
arch
a
house
that
has
a
statue
of
an
angel
conquering
a
dragon
over
the
door
the
only
building
on
the
street
she
is
on
the
top
floor
get
there
before
charles
men
do
you
do
care
about
sophia
she
is
an
innocent
woman
i
do
not
want
her
to
be
hurt
on
my
account
what
about
the
others
your
servant
giancarlo
tilia
caballo
they
thought
i
was
a
merchant
from
trebizond
serving
manfred
as
an
agent
and
sordello
he
seems
to
know
more
about
you
than
he
ever
told
me
it
is
he
who
killed
you
if
he
deserves
to
be
punished
tell
me
the
sky
had
deepened
from
blue
to
indigo
somewhere
nearby
a
girl
was
sobbing
daoud
wondered
if
it
was
she
who
had
screamed
earlier
when
the
bolt
from
the
crossbow
first
hit
him
what
was
a
girl
doing
on
this
battlefield
sordello
deserve
to
be
punished
de
gobignon
tried
to
use
him
against
me
and
i
had
more
powerful
means
to
turn
sordello
against
de
gobignon
but
then
the
sword
turned
in
my
hand
that
is
not
fault
let
de
gobignon
think
him
we
let
him
think
he
was
spying
on
us
actually
he
told
you
only
what
we
wanted
him
to
tell
you
you
saw
his
rage
when
he
realized
how
i
tricked
him
with
sudden
anxiety
he
remembered
the
locket
he
reached
out
with
a
hand
that
had
no
strength
and
put
it
on
de
gobignon
arm
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
when
you
go
looking
for
sophia
do
not
take
sordello
with
you
a
man
soft
voice
overhead
said
simon
we
have
been
waiting
till
most
of
the
men
moved
away
tell
rachel
no
one
will
hurt
her
if
she
speaks
to
david
she
wants
to
say
to
him
daoud
looked
up
and
saw
the
franciscan
who
interpreted
for
the
tartars
he
let
his
head
fall
to
the
side
to
see
where
de
gobignon
was
looking
rachel
older
more
woman
than
girl
now
it
had
been
well
over
a
year
since
he
last
saw
her
it
is
safe
to
come
forward
rachel
de
gobignon
said
we
understand
that
whatever
happened
you
could
not
help
it
rachel
rushed
across
the
intervening
space
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
at
daoud
right
side
reaching
out
with
tentative
hands
to
touch
him
daoud
saw
that
she
was
afraid
that
even
laying
a
hand
on
him
would
cause
him
pain
you
can
not
hurt
me
rachel
she
stroked
his
face
running
her
hand
over
his
beard
oh
messer
david
her
voice
was
husky
with
grief
my
name
is
daoud
rachel
i
am
a
muslim
i
have
wronged
you
greatly
i
beg
your
forgiveness
perhaps
this
is
how
god
punished
me
for
the
sin
i
committed
against
you
you
wanted
to
help
me
i
know
you
did
she
sobbed
and
he
felt
the
weight
of
her
head
on
the
chest
armor
that
had
failed
him
your
servant
giancarlo
rachel
calls
him
lorenzo
helped
rachel
escape
from
anjou
camp
friar
mathieu
said
he
left
us
he
saw
simon
army
coming
and
wanted
to
warn
you
we
left
the
cart
and
wandered
around
the
edge
of
the
battle
looking
for
refuge
we
saw
your
banner
here
simon
you
must
protect
this
girl
daoud
reached
out
to
de
gobignon
find
sophia
friar
mathieu
knelt
next
to
rachel
who
moved
aside
to
make
room
for
him
daoud
said
father
when
i
am
too
weak
to
talk
put
your
fingers
under
the
collar
of
my
tunic
you
will
find
a
small
leather
packet
tied
around
my
neck
take
it
off
and
give
it
to
rachel
he
moved
his
head
slightly
to
see
rachel
better
it
is
a
talisman
made
by
the
sufis
rachel
it
is
called
a
tawidh
if
it
would
not
offend
your
faith
i
would
like
you
to
have
it
as
a
remembrance
of
me
rachel
laid
her
hand
on
daoud
and
repeated
the
unfamiliar
word
tawidh
i
will
treasure
it
always
and
give
it
to
my
children
friar
mathieu
said
i
heard
what
you
told
simon
about
your
past
you
were
baptized
a
christian
daoud
in
god
eyes
you
are
still
a
christian
you
must
confess
that
you
have
sinned
and
you
must
renounce
islam
before
you
die
or
you
will
not
be
saved
your
christian
mother
and
father
are
waiting
for
you
in
heaven
come
i
can
give
you
absolution
daoud
shook
his
head
smiling
how
kind
this
man
was
but
how
sadly
misguided
saved
of
course
i
am
saved
when
a
warrior
dies
fighting
in
defense
of
the
faith
god
welcomes
him
with
open
arms
into
paradise
i
do
ask
your
blessing
you
are
a
holy
man
and
i
ask
your
forgiveness
for
throwing
you
down
those
stairs
that
was
you
de
gobignon
eyes
widened
of
course
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
all
the
things
i
have
done
good
and
bad
i
have
had
a
life
of
many
miracles
de
gobignon
face
hardened
you
killed
alain
daoud
hoped
the
realization
would
not
turn
de
gobignon
against
him
sophia
life
might
depend
on
the
count
forgiving
him
have
i
not
admitted
that
i
waged
secret
war
on
you
in
orvieto
yes
i
killed
your
friend
i
later
was
sorry
i
had
done
it
but
he
could
have
exposed
me
i
hurt
friar
mathieu
but
i
could
not
kill
a
priest
all
the
things
that
thwarted
you
in
orvieto
they
were
my
doing
i
hate
you
for
those
things
for
alain
especially
the
princes
of
europe
and
the
tartars
would
put
countless
men
women
and
children
to
the
sword
they
still
may
do
it
that
is
what
i
came
here
to
fight
against
to
save
my
people
de
gobignon
shook
his
head
how
can
you
feel
they
are
your
people
you
were
not
born
a
muslim
nor
was
muhammad
may
god
commend
and
salute
him
my
faith
is
the
faith
of
the
homeless
the
uprooted
the
exiled
the
prophet
said
began
in
exile
and
it
will
end
in
friar
mathieu
bearded
face
and
anxious
blue
eyes
seemed
to
float
over
daoud
you
lie
there
defeated
dying
charles
has
conquered
manfred
does
this
not
mean
that
your
faith
has
failed
you
whatever
god
purpose
has
been
for
me
i
have
accomplished
it
god
may
destroy
unworthy
bearers
of
the
truth
but
the
truth
he
will
not
destroy
do
you
think
yourself
unworthy
i
hope
i
have
not
been
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
slave
to
god
that
is
what
the
word
mameluke
means
slave
have
wandered
in
the
desert
and
now
i
am
going
to
the
watering
he
wanted
to
say
more
but
there
was
no
strength
in
his
breath
the
silver
globe
was
cracking
like
an
egg
and
a
black
irresistible
tide
of
pain
was
pouring
out
take
the
tawidh
from
around
my
neck
father
he
whispered
he
felt
fingers
at
his
collar
and
after
a
moment
the
thong
slid
free
me
to
die
submissive
unto
thee
and
join
me
to
the
righteous
i
bear
witness
that
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
i
bear
witness
that
muhammad
is
his
servant
and
messenger
amin
he
could
not
hold
the
pain
back
he
could
escape
it
only
in
sleep
he
could
not
see
friar
mathieu
or
simon
de
gobignon
or
rachel
his
eyes
were
closing
he
would
dream
of
sophia
rachel
clutched
the
leather
capsule
desperately
as
if
by
holding
it
tightly
enough
she
could
keep
daoud
alive
she
felt
her
sorrow
crushing
her
as
if
it
were
a
great
stone
pillar
pressing
down
from
the
sky
she
touched
his
cheek
with
her
fingertips
and
his
face
felt
still
as
stone
and
she
knew
the
life
had
gone
out
of
him
she
sat
back
and
tied
the
muslim
amulet
around
her
neck
as
she
had
seen
it
tied
around
his
then
she
dug
the
fingers
of
both
hands
into
the
silk
of
her
gown
near
the
collar
and
pulled
at
it
until
it
tore
she
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
let
darkness
sweep
over
her
mind
as
sobs
shook
her
and
her
tears
fell
lxx
terror
filled
the
little
room
like
a
pool
of
icy
water
soon
sophia
thought
terror
would
drown
them
the
worst
for
her
was
not
knowing
whether
daoud
was
alive
or
dead
dawn
i
had
him
here
in
this
bed
now
after
sunset
i
have
no
idea
where
he
sophia
lay
back
on
the
bed
while
tilia
sat
on
cushions
laid
over
sophia
traveling
chest
ugolini
sat
in
an
armchair
reading
trying
to
read
sophia
suspected
a
book
by
the
light
of
a
candle
in
a
brass
holder
standing
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
only
the
yellow
gleam
of
the
candle
and
the
reddish
light
of
a
low
fire
on
the
hearth
illuminated
the
room
from
the
shadows
along
the
wall
the
icon
of
saint
simon
stared
at
her
she
wondered
whether
she
should
have
spoken
to
daoud
of
what
she
had
come
to
suspect
her
time
of
the
month
regular
as
the
moon
itself
since
she
was
a
girl
was
over
six
weeks
late
it
seemed
the
brew
of
myrrh
juniper
berries
and
powdered
rhubarb
tilia
had
concocted
for
her
and
which
she
had
drunk
faithfully
every
morning
for
six
months
might
have
finally
done
its
work
she
wanted
daoud
to
know
though
she
was
not
sure
whether
he
would
be
pleased
he
had
never
said
that
he
had
any
children
she
wanted
to
be
sure
she
was
truly
carrying
his
child
before
she
told
him
tilia
had
advised
her
to
wait
until
at
least
twelve
weeks
had
gone
by
without
an
issue
of
blood
but
now
it
hurt
her
that
she
had
not
told
him
it
would
have
been
another
parting
gift
she
could
have
given
him
darkness
had
fallen
the
foreboding
quiet
of
benevento
was
broken
by
shouts
in
the
distance
growing
louder
as
they
came
closer
she
heard
a
scream
from
the
street
a
woman
voice
shrill
with
fear
she
shut
her
eyes
and
shuddered
another
scream
this
time
a
man
voice
and
full
of
agony
sophia
body
grew
colder
she
looked
at
ugolini
and
saw
that
he
was
trembling
it
was
not
just
terror
that
was
making
her
cold
the
fire
was
burning
too
low
she
got
up
and
laid
two
more
split
logs
on
it
back
on
the
bed
she
reached
into
the
neck
of
her
gown
and
pulled
on
the
long
silver
chain
drawing
out
the
locket
daoud
had
given
her
she
twisted
the
screw
and
opened
it
and
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
engraved
interlocking
arabesque
pattern
then
daoud
face
superimposed
itself
and
the
pattern
disappeared
it
was
not
a
picture
of
him
it
daoud
as
if
she
were
seeing
him
through
an
open
window
it
was
magic
and
it
frightened
her
she
had
never
before
encountered
magic
his
face
was
alive
though
it
did
not
move
his
blue
eyes
seemed
to
look
right
at
her
she
never
quite
caught
him
blinking
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
have
just
a
moment
ago
he
appeared
about
to
speak
to
her
just
as
the
fresh
logs
on
the
fire
made
the
room
warmer
so
her
terror
subsided
at
the
sight
of
him
what
is
that
tilia
asked
a
keepsake
daoud
gave
me
she
closed
the
hammered
silver
case
and
slid
it
back
inside
the
top
of
her
gown
we
can
not
just
sit
here
tilia
said
we
are
like
mice
waiting
for
the
cat
to
come
and
eat
us
i
do
like
depending
on
someone
else
to
save
me
any
more
than
you
tilia
sophia
said
but
all
we
can
do
is
wait
someone
will
come
for
us
daoud
or
lorenzo
someone
we
should
have
left
long
ago
when
the
ran
away
said
ugolini
then
we
would
have
had
horses
he
looked
reproachfully
at
sophia
sophia
felt
he
had
a
right
to
she
had
persuaded
them
to
stay
here
how
could
she
have
been
so
sure
that
the
news
that
the
battle
was
lost
which
had
thrown
the
into
a
panic
was
merely
a
baseless
rumor
it
was
her
faith
in
daoud
she
thought
her
certainty
that
no
matter
what
happened
on
the
battlefield
he
would
come
for
her
and
take
her
to
safety
adelberto
you
can
not
ride
very
well
said
tilia
and
i
can
not
ride
a
horse
at
all
you
may
be
sure
those
poltroons
would
not
have
carried
us
on
litters
we
could
not
have
left
then
you
could
ride
if
your
life
depended
on
it
said
sophia
you
may
still
have
to
my
life
depends
on
getting
on
a
horse
said
tilia
i
would
surely
break
my
neck
there
were
more
anguished
shrieks
from
somewhere
nearby
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
the
pool
of
terror
rose
higher
sophia
heard
hoofbeats
and
men
voices
loud
in
the
street
outside
she
went
to
the
door
that
led
out
to
the
balcony
and
pushed
it
open
a
crack
with
a
clattering
of
hooves
on
cobblestones
three
mounted
men
rode
down
the
street
looking
up
at
buildings
they
carried
no
torches
but
their
drawn
swords
gave
off
pale
glints
there
was
no
way
she
could
tell
who
they
were
or
which
side
they
were
on
the
man
in
the
lead
pointed
with
his
sword
at
the
house
where
sophia
was
she
leaned
farther
out
her
heart
pounding
at
her
ribs
to
see
the
trio
dismount
and
tie
their
horses
she
turned
away
from
the
doorway
to
the
balcony
and
pointed
silently
downward
ugolini
closed
his
book
with
shaking
hands
tilia
fingered
her
pectoral
cross
that
daoud
had
long
ago
told
sophia
contained
a
poisoned
blade
and
sophia
loosened
the
mouth
of
the
leather
bag
tied
to
her
belt
that
held
the
tiny
crossbow
daoud
had
given
her
would
she
be
able
to
use
it
she
had
shot
a
longbow
for
sport
a
few
times
in
her
life
with
indifferent
accuracy
but
she
had
never
fired
even
a
crossbow
still
if
the
darts
were
poisoned
she
need
not
hit
a
man
in
a
vital
spot
to
stop
him
sophia
heard
scipio
barking
in
the
room
below
tilia
and
ugolini
room
where
they
had
tied
him
there
was
she
knew
no
one
in
the
house
except
the
three
of
them
the
house
belonged
to
a
guelfo
merchant
who
had
fled
town
when
manfred
army
arrived
but
she
did
not
hear
anyone
moving
about
downstairs
as
they
would
if
they
were
looting
the
place
instead
heavy
footsteps
came
up
the
stairs
and
a
voice
called
madonna
sophia
madonna
sophia
are
you
up
there
her
heart
leapt
with
relief
it
was
not
yet
daoud
but
it
must
be
someone
he
had
sent
they
were
rescued
she
was
about
to
explain
the
good
news
to
the
others
when
the
door
to
the
room
swung
open
there
grinning
triumphantly
at
her
sword
in
hand
stood
sordello
he
strode
across
the
room
the
floorboards
squeaking
under
his
boots
and
stood
facing
her
the
hound
barking
boomed
up
from
below
her
heart
sank
she
had
never
trusted
this
man
her
flesh
crawled
whenever
he
looked
at
her
thank
god
i
have
found
you
madonna
two
men
followed
him
in
dressed
in
the
padded
body
armor
and
helmets
of
crossbowmen
as
he
did
they
carried
shortswords
how
you
find
me
sordello
and
for
whom
are
you
fighting
his
back
was
to
the
two
men
who
had
followed
him
he
frowned
at
her
and
shook
his
head
slightly
as
if
trying
to
tell
her
not
to
say
too
much
but
the
little
signal
did
not
allay
her
suspicion
of
him
and
her
fear
why
i
am
here
in
the
service
of
charles
rightful
king
of
sicily
by
decree
of
the
pope
sordello
trumpeted
and
i
serve
his
signory
count
simon
de
gobignon
gloved
fists
on
his
hips
he
turned
slowly
to
gaze
around
the
room
at
his
words
the
pool
of
fear
became
a
flood
of
terror
that
threatened
to
sweep
her
from
her
feet
she
swayed
dizzily
this
meant
the
battle
was
surely
lost
god
what
has
happened
to
daoud
with
a
life
of
their
own
her
trembling
hands
pressed
against
her
stomach
and
look
who
we
have
here
sordello
said
his
magical
eminence
the
vanishing
cardinal
ugolini
and
tilia
caballo
orvieto
most
distinguished
brothel
keeper
of
whose
establishment
i
have
such
happy
memories
are
you
two
now
reduced
to
being
manfred
camp
followers
tilia
stared
with
hatred
at
sordello
ugolini
face
was
as
blank
as
if
he
had
been
clubbed
what
tilia
had
said
earlier
about
cat
and
mouse
was
apt
thought
sophia
sordello
was
tormenting
his
prey
he
could
have
learned
where
i
am
only
from
if
daoud
had
told
him
where
to
find
her
it
must
be
that
sordello
was
still
secretly
daoud
man
as
he
had
been
in
orvieto
that
must
be
what
the
frown
and
the
headshake
meant
you
need
not
glare
at
me
like
that
madama
tilia
sordello
said
you
are
very
lucky
to
be
under
my
protection
tonight
what
will
your
protection
cost
us
tilia
voice
was
heavy
with
scorn
sordello
spread
his
hands
why
whatever
your
lives
are
worth
to
you
you
have
had
much
practice
putting
a
price
on
that
which
is
precious
the
battle
king
manfred
sophia
pressed
him
sordello
grin
broadened
showing
more
stumpy
crooked
teeth
we
anjou
men
are
here
in
benevento
are
we
not
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
is
dead
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
him
fall
sophia
felt
sick
to
her
stomach
blindly
she
staggered
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
heavily
a
long
wail
came
from
ugolini
he
threw
his
book
to
the
floor
and
rocked
back
and
forth
with
his
face
in
his
hands
tilia
rushed
to
him
and
held
him
sophia
cry
of
grief
was
as
as
ugolini
but
she
kept
it
inside
herself
she
had
loved
manfred
once
and
even
after
that
was
over
she
had
delighted
in
attending
his
court
and
had
marveled
at
the
felicity
of
his
kingdom
in
a
day
what
a
loss
what
a
waste
manfred
died
in
a
most
chivalrous
manner
said
sordello
showing
no
sympathy
for
the
anguish
he
was
causing
he
fought
to
the
end
a
few
faithful
followers
beside
him
surrounded
by
enemies
cardinal
de
verceuil
killed
him
i
think
i
will
write
a
poem
about
it
de
verceuil
ugolini
cried
that
pestilence
in
red
robes
if
only
i
had
had
him
poisoned
had
daoud
been
one
of
the
faithful
who
fought
beside
manfred
sophia
throat
almost
closed
with
fear
as
she
asked
the
question
what
of
david
of
trebizond
again
that
little
frown
and
shake
of
the
head
aimed
at
her
alone
more
of
him
later
there
must
be
things
he
did
not
want
to
say
in
front
of
the
two
venetians
but
she
persisted
is
he
alive
is
he
unhurt
sordello
nodded
gravely
his
yellowish
eyes
holding
hers
he
was
alive
when
i
last
saw
him
madonna
she
let
out
a
long
breath
the
ache
of
fear
in
her
stomach
eased
even
if
the
battle
were
lost
daoud
would
manage
to
live
through
it
and
get
back
to
her
perhaps
sordello
was
his
messenger
she
felt
safer
on
her
feet
she
pushed
herself
up
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
leading
to
the
balcony
outside
downstairs
scipio
started
barking
again
capitano
said
one
of
the
archers
are
we
to
stand
here
talking
all
night
there
is
a
whole
town
for
the
taking
here
and
we
are
missing
our
chance
hush
juliano
said
sordello
you
see
before
you
two
very
important
and
wealthy
followers
of
the
late
king
manfred
what
they
can
offer
us
by
way
of
ransom
will
be
far
more
than
the
trinkets
you
could
pick
up
raiding
some
merchant
home
ransom
tilia
spat
what
right
does
a
furfante
like
you
have
to
demand
ransom
of
me
why
madama
is
that
not
exactly
what
scoundrels
do
sordello
laughed
he
sat
down
in
the
spot
sophia
had
just
vacated
on
the
bed
laying
his
glistening
sword
ostentatiously
across
his
lap
sophia
saw
that
he
carried
a
long
dagger
in
a
sheath
hung
on
his
right
side
he
surveyed
them
all
grinning
this
is
torture
if
only
i
could
find
out
what
has
happened
to
you
have
three
choices
madama
tilia
sordello
said
you
may
leave
here
outside
this
house
you
can
take
your
chances
with
the
victorious
warriors
of
charles
who
have
fallen
upon
benevento
like
ravening
wolves
can
you
hear
the
screams
or
you
can
stay
here
under
my
protection
and
it
will
not
cost
you
even
one
denaro
and
in
the
morning
i
will
present
you
all
legally
and
properly
to
king
charles
who
will
be
most
grateful
to
me
for
the
service
he
is
exceedingly
eager
to
round
up
all
of
manfred
principal
servants
some
he
is
beheading
some
he
is
hanging
you
former
eminence
will
probably
pay
at
the
stake
for
your
heresy
and
witchcraft
as
for
you
madama
tilia
if
a
rope
stout
enough
to
hang
you
can
not
be
found
you
may
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
shedding
your
excess
flesh
in
a
dungeon
ugolini
sat
hugging
himself
and
shuddering
tilia
opened
her
wide
mouth
to
speak
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
closed
it
again
but
red
coals
sparkled
in
her
eyes
better
tilia
keep
the
anger
hidden
until
you
can
use
but
sophia
fear
for
daoud
grew
again
at
the
thought
that
he
might
be
charles
captive
awaiting
execution
why
would
sordello
tell
her
nothing
has
david
been
captured
she
ventured
turning
from
the
doorway
to
the
balcony
sordello
smiled
at
her
just
as
scipio
downstairs
broke
into
another
burst
of
furious
barks
in
the
candlelight
sordello
face
turned
a
deep
orange
with
sudden
anger
find
that
damned
dog
and
kill
it
wait
said
tilia
that
is
giancarlo
hound
scipio
we
put
him
down
in
our
room
to
guard
our
belongings
just
what
i
thought
said
sordello
that
is
why
i
wish
him
killed
but
he
is
a
thoroughbred
boarhound
tilia
went
on
and
since
it
appears
giancarlo
has
lost
him
let
him
be
part
of
our
ransom
he
is
easily
worth
several
hundred
florins
i
have
always
loathed
that
dog
said
sordello
i
would
gladly
kill
it
just
to
avenge
myself
on
giancarlo
for
killing
the
tartars
in
the
midst
of
her
terror
sophia
felt
a
stab
of
surprise
the
tartars
dead
giancarlo
killed
them
did
that
mean
rachel
was
free
yes
growled
sordello
and
if
i
find
him
i
will
personally
repay
him
by
cutting
him
to
bits
starting
at
his
toes
for
that
and
for
the
many
other
injuries
he
has
done
me
but
madama
tilia
is
right
the
hound
is
doubtless
worth
too
much
money
to
kill
i
will
take
it
then
he
gestured
to
his
two
men
have
these
two
display
their
possessions
for
you
do
not
harm
the
dog
or
them
for
that
matter
i
want
them
back
here
intact
when
you
are
done
so
i
know
i
am
getting
an
honest
inventory
i
do
not
know
whether
we
can
satisfy
you
said
tilia
we
did
not
bring
everything
we
own
with
us
if
you
would
help
us
get
to
lucera
we
could
make
you
princely
rich
sordello
leaned
back
and
crossed
his
legs
but
lucera
is
far
from
here
and
there
may
not
be
time
for
us
to
collect
what
you
have
there
in
a
few
days
king
charles
will
unleash
his
locusts
and
scorpions
far
and
wide
throughout
this
land
his
bailiffs
and
judges
and
clerks
and
tax
collectors
and
to
lay
hold
of
every
speck
of
gold
and
chip
of
precious
stone
for
now
please
help
my
men
collect
what
you
have
with
you
i
am
sure
you
have
plenty
that
cross
on
your
handsome
bosom
for
instance
i
suspect
a
man
might
buy
himself
a
small
castle
with
that
he
reached
out
and
tilia
stepped
back
but
into
the
grip
of
one
of
the
archers
tears
sprang
from
her
eyes
and
trickled
down
her
painted
cheeks
please
let
me
keep
it
just
a
little
longer
if
i
must
part
with
it
in
the
end
i
will
but
it
is
very
dear
to
me
sordello
waved
grandly
for
now
then
go
now
with
these
fellows
and
mind
you
hold
nothing
back
they
are
venetians
you
ca
hide
anything
valuable
from
a
venetian
indeed
thought
sophia
remembering
tales
of
how
the
venetians
had
looted
her
beloved
constantinople
years
ago
as
she
watched
the
shuffling
ugolini
and
the
dauntless
tilia
leave
with
sordello
two
men
she
felt
her
knees
trembling
so
hard
under
her
gown
that
she
could
barely
stand
she
would
be
alone
with
sordello
be
wary
of
the
dog
sordello
called
after
his
archers
but
be
careful
not
to
hurt
it
sì
capitano
the
door
closed
with
a
thump
and
now
sophia
said
sordello
lifting
the
sword
from
his
lap
and
laying
it
carefully
on
the
bed
we
settle
accounts
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
accounts
said
sophia
making
her
voice
as
cold
and
forbidding
as
she
could
but
before
anything
else
the
truth
if
you
can
manage
it
i
have
seen
you
serving
simon
and
i
have
seen
you
serving
david
and
now
you
say
you
are
on
the
side
of
charles
who
do
you
truly
serve
sordello
stretched
his
booted
legs
and
crossed
them
leaning
back
in
the
chair
myself
andrea
sordello
of
course
men
may
command
part
of
me
but
only
i
own
all
of
me
in
the
beginning
i
was
to
serve
simon
reporting
secretly
to
anjou
in
orvieto
david
was
my
master
he
offered
me
a
rich
reward
but
then
he
threatened
to
kill
me
i
fled
orvieto
following
simon
after
that
i
was
mostly
simon
man
a
little
bit
david
man
i
sent
him
information
from
perugia
and
viterbo
and
he
sent
me
money
but
first
last
and
always
my
own
man
why
are
you
here
then
sophia
let
her
hand
rest
on
the
door
handle
as
if
she
might
rush
out
on
the
balcony
and
call
for
help
she
hoped
sordello
would
expect
her
to
do
that
rather
than
try
to
use
a
weapon
on
him
sordello
stood
up
smiling
madonna
you
are
not
aware
how
i
have
suffered
because
of
you
suffered
with
longing
you
owe
me
much
for
that
he
strolled
over
to
the
fire
picked
up
a
big
log
from
the
pile
next
to
the
hearth
and
set
it
on
the
burning
wood
may
god
shrivel
his
phallos
sophia
felt
her
stomach
burn
at
the
idea
of
this
repulsive
man
lusting
after
her
she
turned
quickly
facing
the
balcony
door
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
grope
in
the
bag
at
her
belt
for
the
tiny
crossbow
and
the
box
of
darts
daoud
had
given
her
how
quickly
she
asked
herself
could
she
take
the
crossbow
out
get
a
poisoned
dart
from
the
box
without
scratching
herself
load
it
draw
the
bow
aim
and
shoot
could
be
across
the
room
and
tearing
the
thing
out
of
my
hands
before
i
got
all
that
helplessness
made
her
tremble
having
made
sure
of
the
location
of
crossbow
and
darts
she
turned
to
him
again
gripping
the
skirt
of
her
gown
to
hide
the
shaking
of
her
hands
if
you
find
me
attractive
i
am
flattered
of
course
but
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
you
do
not
wish
to
escape
from
benevento
you
wish
to
be
turned
over
to
king
charles
judges
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
he
bared
his
broken
teeth
do
you
think
they
will
have
trouble
finding
something
to
accuse
you
of
not
if
i
tell
them
what
i
know
then
he
raised
a
finger
it
was
david
of
trebizond
who
told
me
where
to
find
you
and
you
keep
asking
about
him
i
always
suspected
when
i
was
serving
david
at
cardinal
ugolini
that
there
must
be
something
between
you
two
if
there
is
any
spark
of
mercy
in
you
at
all
do
not
play
with
me
like
this
tell
me
if
he
is
alive
she
wanted
to
seize
him
by
the
arm
but
she
was
afraid
to
get
too
close
to
him
the
light
of
the
one
candle
in
the
room
cast
shadows
like
black
blots
on
sordello
grinning
face
play
with
you
ah
but
if
there
is
a
spark
of
mercy
in
then
you
will
play
with
me
i
will
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
being
alone
with
you
like
this
i
burn
so
with
desire
i
would
do
anything
good
or
evil
to
possess
you
scipio
thunderous
barks
bursting
out
suddenly
made
her
jump
she
heard
male
voices
cry
out
alarmed
then
scipio
rumbling
snarls
then
silence
sordello
glowered
at
the
floor
god
beard
i
almost
hope
they
did
kill
that
brute
to
distract
him
a
little
longer
from
herself
sophia
said
you
had
better
hope
scipio
does
not
hurt
what
do
i
care
if
they
suffer
a
few
bites
the
dog
is
worth
more
than
they
are
he
looked
up
at
her
do
you
know
anything
about
journeys
to
paradise
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
was
that
a
name
for
some
carnal
pleasure
he
wanted
to
have
with
her
come
away
from
that
balcony
door
sordello
said
the
air
is
fresher
here
from
the
street
she
heard
swords
clanging
men
screaming
and
cursing
and
hooves
pounding
there
was
fighting
nearby
our
french
friends
quarreling
over
their
loot
said
sordello
do
you
stand
by
the
balcony
door
because
you
fancy
being
rescued
from
by
they
are
animals
like
that
dog
downstairs
what
i
feel
for
you
is
far
more
profound
than
the
desire
to
rape
some
conquered
woman
i
am
a
trovatore
after
all
i
will
prove
it
to
you
just
let
me
see
you
unclothed
like
mother
eve
i
will
not
touch
you
undress
yourself
and
i
will
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
about
the
man
called
david
she
wanted
to
spit
in
his
face
she
was
desperate
to
know
what
he
could
tell
her
but
even
if
he
did
tell
her
about
daoud
how
could
she
put
any
trust
in
him
if
daoud
was
alive
he
would
find
his
way
to
her
or
she
to
him
she
had
nothing
to
gain
by
cooperating
with
sordello
you
disgust
me
she
cried
i
wish
you
were
not
even
able
to
see
my
face
let
alone
the
rest
of
me
and
she
turned
away
from
him
her
hand
dipping
into
the
leather
bag
she
heard
his
heavy
footsteps
thudding
on
the
wooden
floor
and
another
outburst
of
barking
from
below
i
wanted
you
to
give
yourself
to
me
willingly
sordello
said
but
if
you
refuse
me
i
will
take
you
and
while
i
am
doing
it
i
will
tell
you
about
the
man
david
terror
seized
her
and
shook
her
as
if
she
were
a
rag
doll
the
way
that
filthy
pig
said
that
it
must
mean
something
bad
had
happened
to
daoud
she
felt
paralyzed
by
fear
and
grief
then
sudden
rage
made
her
want
to
strike
out
at
this
man
who
was
hurting
her
so
she
had
the
box
of
darts
open
now
she
must
be
very
careful
of
the
poisoned
tips
the
door
to
the
room
crashed
open
lxxi
sophia
she
dropped
a
loose
dart
back
into
the
bag
and
turned
simon
de
gobignon
stood
in
the
doorway
staring
at
her
the
firelight
made
his
face
glow
his
surcoat
was
ripped
showing
the
mail
underneath
and
she
saw
dark
stains
on
the
purple
and
gold
he
was
splashed
with
blood
she
thought
her
stomach
churning
his
head
was
bare
his
mail
hood
thrown
back
and
his
mail
collar
open
he
held
his
helmet
adorned
with
the
figure
of
a
winged
heraldic
beast
under
his
arm
at
first
sight
of
him
she
felt
a
glow
of
joy
simon
lived
and
she
was
safe
from
sordello
triumphantly
she
glanced
over
at
the
bravo
and
felt
even
better
at
the
sight
of
his
scarlet
color
his
clenched
jaw
the
swollen
veins
throbbing
in
his
temples
then
suddenly
it
came
back
to
her
that
simon
was
an
enemy
too
has
always
been
too
easy
for
me
to
forget
she
would
have
to
face
his
questions
his
accusations
his
pain
his
rage
she
felt
like
a
bird
in
flight
suddenly
struck
by
an
arrow
and
plummeting
to
earth
and
a
worse
thought
struck
her
piercing
her
heart
like
a
sword
what
was
it
that
sordello
would
have
told
her
about
daoud
in
god
name
what
terrible
thing
had
happened
to
him
simon
being
here
meant
he
too
must
have
learned
where
she
was
from
daoud
where
then
was
daoud
she
saw
figures
in
the
shadows
outside
the
door
one
and
the
other
a
small
woman
wearing
a
mantle
over
her
head
simon
took
a
few
steps
into
the
room
his
mail
clinking
she
could
tell
by
his
movements
that
he
was
exhausted
she
felt
a
surge
of
pity
for
him
at
what
he
must
have
done
and
suffered
she
reminded
herself
he
had
been
fighting
against
manfred
and
daoud
on
the
side
of
anjou
still
she
felt
sorry
for
him
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
simon
said
glaring
at
sordello
his
voice
crackling
with
anger
so
much
sophia
wondered
you
wanted
me
to
be
gone
your
signory
and
it
seemed
most
useful
for
me
to
come
here
it
occurred
to
me
that
important
followers
of
the
infidel
manfred
might
be
here
and
indeed
on
the
floor
below
you
will
find
his
agents
tilia
caballo
and
ugolini
being
questioned
by
my
men
and
you
were
this
lady
before
god
i
do
not
know
what
keeps
me
from
running
you
through
his
mailed
hand
reached
across
his
waist
to
grip
the
hilt
of
his
sword
easy
simon
said
the
man
he
came
into
the
room
now
and
sophia
recognized
friar
mathieu
the
tartars
franciscan
companion
she
looked
past
the
elderly
priest
and
saw
who
was
with
him
rachel
in
the
midst
of
her
fear
and
sorrow
sophia
felt
an
instant
of
miraculous
happiness
as
if
the
sun
had
come
out
at
midnight
she
rushed
across
the
room
holding
out
her
arms
and
the
girl
flew
into
them
rachel
what
a
joy
to
see
you
oh
sophia
sophia
rachel
was
crying
but
not
for
joy
she
was
sobbing
heartbrokenly
what
had
happened
to
her
how
do
you
come
to
be
with
count
simon
sophia
asked
hoping
that
answering
would
calm
rachel
but
rachel
went
on
weeping
into
sophia
shoulder
and
friar
mathieu
spoke
for
her
rachel
and
i
fell
in
with
count
simon
and
we
thought
it
safest
to
stay
with
him
and
he
chose
to
come
here
it
all
right
now
sophia
said
patting
rachel
back
as
she
held
her
in
her
arms
everything
will
be
all
right
no
sophia
no
rachel
it
seemed
could
not
stop
crying
bewildered
sophia
looked
up
friar
mathieu
and
simon
were
standing
side
by
side
in
the
center
of
the
room
sordello
his
face
working
with
barely
controlled
fury
had
moved
to
a
far
corner
his
sword
still
lay
on
the
bed
sophia
noticed
but
his
hand
was
on
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
simon
and
the
franciscan
were
looking
not
at
rachel
but
at
sophia
david
told
you
i
was
here
sophia
said
he
must
have
in
an
instant
she
understood
why
daoud
had
told
simon
where
to
find
her
and
why
rachel
kept
weeping
and
weeping
is
he
dead
she
asked
they
answered
her
with
silence
a
wave
of
dizziness
came
over
her
she
reeled
and
rachel
was
holding
her
up
friar
mathieu
took
her
arm
and
they
lowered
her
into
the
armchair
she
knocked
the
candle
to
the
floor
putting
it
out
now
the
only
light
in
the
room
was
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
she
felt
empty
inside
am
mortally
she
thought
feel
now
only
a
shock
a
numbness
the
pain
will
the
only
reason
daoud
would
tell
simon
where
to
find
her
had
to
be
that
he
was
dying
and
wanted
simon
to
protect
her
daoud
truly
must
be
dead
simon
anguished
look
as
if
he
were
begging
for
something
confirmed
it
but
to
be
sure
she
had
to
hear
it
has
david
been
killed
simon
nodded
slowly
his
eyes
huge
with
pain
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
i
even
know
now
that
he
is
not
david
but
daoud
he
hesitated
pronouncing
the
unfamiliar
name
was
with
him
when
he
she
wanted
to
scream
but
she
hurt
so
much
inside
that
she
could
not
even
scream
she
could
not
make
a
sound
daoud
was
she
had
seen
him
she
had
spoken
to
him
she
had
loved
him
for
the
last
time
but
she
to
see
him
again
her
cold
hand
fumbled
at
her
neck
pulled
the
locket
up
from
her
bosom
by
its
silver
chain
she
turned
the
screw
that
opened
it
and
stared
at
the
spirals
and
squares
nothing
happened
the
pattern
to
her
eyes
a
jumble
of
shapes
representing
nothing
remained
inert
even
his
likeness
was
gone
how
had
he
died
she
looked
up
at
simon
to
ask
him
and
then
she
did
scream
sordello
crouched
in
the
semidark
behind
simon
his
dagger
reflecting
red
firelight
poised
horizontally
to
slash
unprotected
throat
his
eyes
glittered
his
mouth
shaped
a
smile
as
if
he
were
drunk
baring
his
gleaming
broken
teeth
sordello
seemed
not
even
to
notice
her
scream
without
a
sound
unseen
by
the
other
three
who
were
all
staring
at
sophia
he
raised
his
left
arm
to
seize
simon
and
his
right
hand
to
strike
with
the
dagger
sophia
hand
dove
into
the
bag
at
her
waist
the
loose
dart
could
scratch
her
and
a
scratch
might
be
enough
to
kill
her
but
that
did
not
matter
her
fingers
found
the
dart
she
wrapped
her
fist
around
it
and
flung
herself
out
of
the
chair
straight
at
simon
simon
tried
to
fend
her
off
but
she
darted
under
his
hands
twisted
around
him
and
drove
the
dart
into
sordello
throat
blood
spurted
over
her
hand
sordello
seemed
neither
to
see
her
nor
to
feel
the
dart
his
eyes
stayed
fixed
on
simon
neck
he
slashed
at
simon
but
sophia
lunge
had
pushed
the
two
men
apart
sordello
blade
scratched
simon
neck
just
under
his
right
ear
then
it
fell
from
the
bravo
fingers
sordello
the
dart
still
hanging
from
his
throat
staggered
backward
his
knees
buckling
his
body
folded
and
he
lay
sideways
on
the
floor
the
four
living
people
in
the
room
were
as
still
as
the
dead
one
then
simon
touched
his
fingertips
to
his
neck
and
winced
sophia
saw
a
rivulet
of
blood
running
down
into
his
mail
collar
friar
mathieu
tore
away
a
piece
of
the
bedsheet
and
dabbed
simon
wound
with
it
he
took
simon
hand
as
if
he
were
a
puppet
and
pressed
his
fingers
against
the
rag
to
hold
it
in
place
then
he
knelt
over
sordello
body
and
whispered
in
latin
whimpering
sophia
stumbled
back
to
the
armchair
where
she
had
been
sitting
a
sob
forced
itself
up
from
her
chest
into
her
throat
she
felt
rachel
gentle
hands
helping
her
to
sit
down
another
sob
came
up
shaking
her
body
another
followed
it
and
another
she
lost
touch
with
everything
around
her
for
a
time
buried
in
a
black
pit
where
neither
sight
nor
sound
nor
even
thought
could
penetrate
she
was
lost
in
wordless
mindless
grief
then
gradually
she
began
to
hear
murmurings
voices
friar
mathieu
said
she
saved
your
life
simon
said
i
know
david
daoud
told
me
not
to
take
sordello
with
me
if
i
went
looking
for
sophia
as
if
he
knew
this
might
happen
how
could
that
be
rachel
was
sitting
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
gently
stroking
shoulder
friar
mathieu
said
why
would
sordello
try
to
kill
you
because
he
was
about
to
rape
sophia
when
you
interrupted
or
because
he
was
afraid
you
would
punish
him
for
killing
daoud
amazement
jolted
sophia
body
she
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
at
friar
mathieu
killed
daoud
simon
answered
her
i
will
tell
you
how
he
died
i
must
talk
to
you
i
have
waited
more
than
a
year
you
know
to
see
you
again
sobs
still
shook
her
but
she
nodded
and
wiped
her
face
with
the
sleeve
of
her
gown
he
reached
down
she
took
his
arm
and
he
helped
her
up
she
saw
that
he
had
a
bloodstained
strip
of
linen
tied
around
his
neck
the
balcony
she
said
good
as
she
went
to
her
chest
to
get
her
cloak
sophia
looked
at
the
icon
of
the
saint
of
the
pillar
and
thought
how
much
even
though
it
had
name
the
expression
looked
like
daoud
simon
held
the
door
to
the
balcony
for
her
the
night
was
cold
and
moonless
the
bitter
smell
of
burning
floated
on
the
freezing
air
the
shouts
of
frenzied
soldiers
and
the
agonized
screams
of
men
and
women
seemed
to
come
from
everywhere
fires
blazed
in
all
parts
of
the
town
their
glow
and
smoke
turning
the
night
sky
a
cloudy
on
the
plain
to
the
north
campfires
twinkled
somewhere
out
there
daoud
lay
dead
she
looked
up
at
simon
darkness
hid
his
face
the
ruddy
glow
of
burning
benevento
haloed
his
head
in
a
quiet
even
voice
he
told
sophia
how
he
came
upon
daoud
fighting
side
by
side
with
manfred
and
how
he
fought
with
daoud
after
manfred
was
killed
how
he
lay
helpless
with
sword
pointed
at
his
face
he
did
not
move
for
a
long
time
simon
said
it
was
growing
dark
but
i
saw
the
look
on
his
face
a
gentle
look
he
did
not
want
to
kill
me
i
am
sure
of
it
and
then
without
any
warning
had
come
the
treacherous
crossbow
bolt
out
of
the
circle
around
them
and
daoud
had
fallen
it
was
sordello
he
could
not
understand
my
rage
at
him
he
kept
protesting
that
he
had
saved
my
life
he
had
not
sophia
thought
of
sordello
attempt
to
seduce
her
she
clutched
the
wooden
railing
choking
bile
rising
in
her
throat
i
am
glad
i
killed
him
she
whispered
i
have
never
killed
anyone
before
tonight
that
i
killed
him
was
a
gift
from
god
simon
did
not
answer
at
once
then
he
said
tonight
before
daoud
died
he
told
me
that
you
were
innocently
drawn
into
his
conspiracy
against
the
alliance
he
said
he
took
advantage
of
my
love
for
you
and
that
you
and
he
were
never
close
but
now
that
you
heard
he
is
dead
you
are
like
a
woman
who
has
lost
a
husband
or
a
lover
he
stopped
he
needed
to
say
no
more
she
knew
what
he
was
asking
the
enormous
aching
void
inside
her
made
it
almost
impossible
to
think
daoud
even
as
he
lay
dying
had
tried
to
protect
her
simon
might
have
suspicions
but
about
who
she
was
or
what
she
had
done
he
knew
nothing
manfred
was
dead
tilia
ugolini
and
lorenzo
wherever
they
might
be
now
would
say
nothing
she
could
if
she
chose
become
the
person
simon
thought
she
was
the
person
who
had
given
herself
to
simon
in
love
at
the
lake
outside
perugia
she
need
only
seize
the
chance
daoud
had
given
her
in
all
italy
there
was
no
place
for
her
now
once
again
she
belonged
nowhere
and
to
no
one
and
she
could
be
a
wife
to
this
good
young
man
she
could
be
the
countess
de
gobignon
with
a
station
in
life
with
power
to
accomplish
things
to
change
the
world
you
want
to
know
what
daoud
meant
to
me
she
said
did
you
tell
him
what
i
meant
to
you
she
was
amazed
at
how
level
her
voice
sounded
i
think
he
knew
simon
spoke
just
above
a
whisper
i
did
not
feel
i
had
to
tell
him
anything
then
daoud
had
died
not
knowing
that
she
and
simon
had
for
a
moment
been
lovers
did
it
matter
if
daoud
had
known
perhaps
he
would
have
killed
simon
instead
of
just
standing
over
him
with
his
sword
his
not
knowing
had
not
hurt
daoud
but
it
was
hurting
her
was
a
part
of
myself
i
withheld
from
him
and
that
was
my
loss
because
much
as
he
loved
me
he
did
not
know
me
but
if
she
regretted
not
telling
daoud
the
truth
about
that
single
moment
how
could
she
ever
bear
to
hide
from
simon
the
truth
about
her
whole
life
could
she
pretend
forevermore
to
be
sophia
orfali
the
naive
sicilian
girl
the
cardinal
niece
with
whom
simon
had
fallen
in
love
could
she
pour
all
of
herself
into
a
mask
could
she
live
with
simon
enjoying
the
love
and
the
wealth
and
power
he
offered
her
knowing
that
it
was
all
founded
on
a
lie
never
the
pain
of
daoud
death
was
nearly
unbearable
but
it
was
pain
true
pain
ever
since
that
night
of
death
in
constantinople
a
night
much
like
this
she
had
not
felt
at
home
in
the
world
now
she
saw
her
place
all
she
owned
in
the
world
was
the
person
she
was
and
what
she
had
done
if
she
deceived
simon
she
would
have
to
deny
her
very
existence
i
would
have
to
deny
the
greatest
happiness
i
have
ever
known
my
love
for
if
she
lied
to
simon
it
would
be
as
if
daoud
had
never
been
it
would
be
like
killing
him
a
second
time
her
heart
screaming
even
now
with
her
longing
for
daoud
would
scream
forever
in
silence
buried
alive
simon
must
already
suspect
the
truth
he
might
try
to
believe
whatever
she
told
him
about
herself
still
some
awareness
of
his
would
remain
with
him
even
if
he
refused
to
think
about
it
it
would
fester
inside
him
slowly
poisoning
him
her
eyes
had
adjusted
to
the
darkness
and
she
could
see
the
suffering
in
simon
long
narrow
face
as
he
waited
for
her
answer
starlight
twinkled
on
the
jeweled
handle
of
the
sword
at
his
belt
what
she
told
him
might
make
him
hate
her
so
much
that
he
would
kill
her
have
never
been
more
willing
to
simon
i
promised
you
that
when
i
saw
you
again
i
would
tell
you
why
i
could
not
marry
you
i
hoped
i
never
would
have
to
tell
you
he
said
i
had
not
wanted
to
fight
in
this
war
of
charles
against
manfred
or
to
bring
the
men
of
gobignon
with
me
when
i
found
that
you
had
fled
to
manfred
kingdom
i
changed
my
mind
her
pain
had
been
like
a
pile
of
rocks
heaped
upon
her
and
what
he
said
was
the
final
boulder
crushing
her
her
ribs
seemed
to
splinter
her
lungs
labored
for
breath
i
must
bear
the
guilt
for
simon
coming
to
the
war
how
many
men
died
today
because
of
me
she
could
hardly
feel
more
sorrow
but
the
night
around
her
seemed
to
grow
blacker
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
he
did
kill
her
she
would
tell
him
everything
straight
out
without
trying
to
protect
herself
from
his
anger
my
name
is
sophia
karaiannides
i
worked
as
a
spy
in
constantinople
for
michael
paleologos
and
helped
him
overthrow
the
frankish
usurper
i
was
michael
concubine
for
a
time
then
he
sent
me
to
be
his
private
messenger
to
manfred
court
here
in
italy
manfred
chose
to
make
me
his
mistress
but
that
became
difficult
for
him
and
dangerous
for
me
when
daoud
came
to
manfred
asking
for
help
in
thwarting
the
tartar
alliance
manfred
sent
me
along
to
orvieto
to
help
him
i
fell
in
love
with
daoud
simon
leaned
his
long
body
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
house
having
to
hear
this
all
at
once
must
be
overwhelming
so
you
went
from
one
to
bed
to
the
next
as
you
went
from
one
country
to
the
next
it
hurt
her
to
hear
his
words
his
voice
tight
with
pain
but
she
had
expected
this
daoud
and
i
did
not
come
together
as
man
and
woman
at
first
she
said
he
did
not
want
to
be
close
to
me
he
staggered
back
to
the
edge
of
the
balcony
as
if
she
had
struck
him
and
she
was
afraid
he
might
fall
he
whispered
not
at
first
but
you
did
yes
we
did
she
said
thinking
he
is
going
to
draw
that
scimitar
and
kill
but
the
only
movement
he
made
was
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
telling
her
to
go
on
i
must
tell
you
simon
that
it
was
i
who
first
fell
in
love
with
daoud
there
were
moments
when
i
hated
him
when
he
killed
your
friend
for
instance
but
as
i
got
to
know
him
better
and
better
i
could
not
help
loving
him
i
had
been
loved
by
an
emperor
and
a
king
but
i
had
never
met
a
man
like
daoud
he
had
begun
as
a
slave
and
he
became
warrior
philosopher
poet
even
a
kind
of
priest
all
in
one
magnificent
person
you
probably
have
no
idea
what
i
am
talking
about
you
knew
him
only
as
the
merchant
david
of
trebizond
i
knew
you
only
as
sophia
orfali
you
may
despise
me
now
that
you
have
learned
so
much
about
me
but
the
more
you
knew
of
him
the
more
you
would
have
had
to
admire
him
how
insignificant
i
must
have
seemed
to
you
beside
such
grandeur
she
could
hear
him
breathing
heavily
in
the
darkness
sounding
like
a
man
struggling
under
a
weight
he
could
not
bear
i
did
love
you
simon
that
was
why
i
cried
when
you
said
you
wanted
to
marry
me
the
word
love
has
many
meanings
and
your
french
troubadours
may
call
it
blasphemy
but
it
possible
for
a
woman
to
love
more
than
one
man
not
blasphemy
trahison
treachery
as
you
wish
but
in
that
moment
you
and
i
shared
by
the
lake
near
perugia
i
was
altogether
yours
that
too
is
why
i
fled
from
you
i
could
not
stand
being
torn
in
two
why
torn
in
two
if
you
find
you
can
love
more
than
one
man
the
hate
in
his
voice
made
her
want
to
throw
herself
from
the
balcony
but
she
told
herself
it
would
ease
his
suffering
for
him
to
feel
that
way
i
said
it
was
possible
i
did
not
say
it
was
easy
especially
when
the
two
men
are
at
war
with
each
other
and
did
daoud
know
about
me
did
you
tell
him
what
you
and
i
did
that
day
no
she
said
finding
it
almost
impossible
to
force
the
words
through
her
constricted
throat
i
could
never
tell
him
so
you
could
not
admit
to
this
man
this
philosopher
this
priest
that
you
had
betrayed
him
with
me
no
she
whispered
he
was
jealous
as
you
are
at
first
he
wanted
me
to
seduce
you
but
as
he
came
to
love
me
i
saw
it
happening
and
i
saw
him
fighting
it
he
came
to
hate
the
idea
of
letting
you
make
love
to
me
he
came
to
hate
you
because
of
that
and
because
he
envied
you
envied
me
yes
he
saw
you
as
one
who
had
all
that
he
never
had
a
home
a
family
simon
stepped
forward
and
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
did
you
tell
him
about
my
parentage
no
never
why
not
his
voice
was
bitter
was
that
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
were
expected
to
find
out
could
he
not
have
found
a
way
to
use
it
were
you
not
betraying
your
war
against
us
what
do
you
byzantines
call
us
franks
by
withholding
it
i
told
you
that
loving
you
both
was
tearing
me
apart
she
said
helplessly
but
you
loved
him
more
that
is
clear
yes
i
loved
him
more
because
he
knew
me
as
i
was
and
loved
me
as
i
was
you
loved
me
and
it
broke
my
heart
to
see
how
much
you
loved
me
but
you
loved
the
woman
i
was
pretending
to
be
now
that
you
really
know
me
you
hate
me
should
i
not
how
can
you
tell
me
all
this
without
shame
i
am
not
ashamed
i
am
sorry
more
sorry
than
i
can
ever
say
but
what
have
i
to
be
ashamed
of
i
am
a
woman
of
byzantium
i
was
fighting
for
my
people
surely
you
know
what
your
franks
did
to
constantinople
look
and
listen
to
what
anjou
army
is
doing
tonight
to
benevento
daoud
spoke
that
way
as
he
lay
dying
simon
said
slowly
a
sob
convulsed
sophia
it
was
a
moment
before
she
could
speak
again
i
hope
at
least
you
understand
us
daoud
and
me
a
little
better
said
sophia
kill
me
now
or
hang
me
or
burn
me
tomorrow
as
i
feel
now
death
would
be
a
relief
i
know
how
you
feel
said
simon
i
too
have
lost
the
one
i
loved
oh
simon
she
felt
herself
starting
to
weep
again
for
simon
and
daoud
both
what
do
you
want
to
do
he
asked
what
does
it
matter
i
am
your
prisoner
and
rachel
and
tilia
and
ugolini
all
of
us
she
remembered
the
hope
she
had
been
harboring
these
past
few
weeks
if
she
died
now
would
another
life
within
her
die
if
she
lived
how
would
she
care
for
that
life
he
sighed
for
me
this
is
all
over
if
i
hurt
you
what
good
would
that
do
me
now
it
would
be
just
one
more
unbearable
memory
to
carry
with
me
through
life
one
more
reason
to
hate
myself
i
want
to
know
if
you
were
free
to
do
as
you
wish
what
would
you
do
her
mind
numbed
with
sorrow
was
a
blank
with
daoud
dead
the
remainder
of
her
life
seemed
worthless
to
her
even
the
thought
that
she
might
be
carrying
daoud
child
seemed
only
added
reason
for
sorrow
now
that
all
of
italy
is
in
the
hands
of
manfred
enemies
i
suppose
i
would
go
back
to
constantinople
she
said
the
thought
of
returning
home
to
the
city
she
loved
was
a
faint
light
in
the
blackness
of
her
despair
for
my
part
i
would
not
stop
you
from
going
he
said
the
weary
sadness
in
his
voice
stung
her
if
he
meant
it
and
he
seemed
to
she
should
be
relieved
overjoyed
even
but
all
she
felt
was
the
weight
of
her
grief
pressing
pain
into
the
very
marrow
of
her
bones
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
tilia
caballo
and
ugolini
she
asked
i
am
sure
king
charles
wants
them
but
i
do
not
care
to
be
the
one
who
dooms
them
by
turning
them
over
to
him
the
title
sounded
so
strange
that
was
how
the
ones
who
supported
him
must
speak
of
him
of
course
and
her
heart
wept
a
little
for
manfred
whom
she
had
not
thought
of
in
her
agony
over
death
she
heard
the
note
of
disdain
toward
charles
in
simon
voice
and
wondered
at
it
you
will
not
deliver
charles
enemies
to
him
after
coming
here
and
helping
him
win
his
war
have
you
turned
against
him
gradually
too
gradually
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
come
to
see
that
charles
was
not
the
great
man
i
once
thought
him
to
be
when
i
learned
that
john
and
philip
were
killed
that
killed
any
remaining
feeling
i
have
for
charles
so
i
will
help
you
if
i
can
but
where
can
you
all
go
all
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
will
be
overrun
with
anjou
men
i
can
not
keep
you
and
you
can
not
safely
leave
me
let
us
go
back
to
the
others
said
sophia
it
will
be
best
if
we
talk
together
about
this
she
could
hardly
believe
he
was
serious
about
letting
her
escape
her
mind
was
unable
to
come
to
grips
with
what
was
happening
to
her
how
she
needed
daoud
he
would
know
what
to
do
as
she
entered
the
firelit
room
her
eyes
blurred
with
tears
but
she
saw
at
once
that
there
were
more
people
in
the
room
than
when
she
had
gone
out
on
the
balcony
with
simon
one
of
them
was
holding
a
crossbow
leveled
at
simon
her
heart
stopped
then
she
recognized
him
and
she
let
her
breath
out
in
relief
black
and
white
curly
hair
graying
mustache
broad
shoulders
lorenzo
she
heard
a
growling
scipio
stood
there
held
tightly
on
a
leash
by
tilia
ugolini
was
beside
her
rachel
hurried
to
sophia
and
took
her
hand
i
glad
you
are
back
i
was
frightened
for
you
simon
wants
to
help
us
said
sophia
taking
rachel
hand
she
could
not
give
up
in
despair
she
thought
while
she
had
rachel
to
care
for
you
took
long
enough
to
come
in
off
that
balcony
count
lorenzo
said
put
down
your
crossbow
sophia
said
count
simon
has
decided
to
be
a
friend
to
us
i
would
not
regret
giving
our
new
friend
just
what
friend
daoud
got
today
from
his
man
sordello
lorenzo
said
tilia
said
do
you
know
sophia
about
daoud
holding
herself
rigid
against
this
fresh
reminder
of
her
grief
sophia
said
only
yes
friar
mathieu
said
lorenzo
the
man
who
killed
daoud
lies
there
on
the
floor
no
need
to
talk
about
revenge
he
pointed
to
a
corner
of
the
room
where
sordello
body
lay
needing
a
moment
relief
from
her
pain
sophia
said
lorenzo
how
did
you
ever
get
here
still
holding
the
crossbow
pointed
at
simon
lorenzo
spoke
without
looking
at
her
after
i
got
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
out
of
the
french
camp
i
saw
this
fellow
army
charging
down
from
the
hills
to
attack
daoud
and
his
falcons
lorenzo
shook
the
crossbow
sophia
prayed
that
he
would
put
the
crossbow
down
what
if
by
accident
he
unleashed
a
bolt
at
simon
if
simon
were
to
die
before
her
eyes
that
would
surely
be
more
than
she
could
bear
i
had
to
try
to
warn
daoud
lorenzo
said
i
left
rachel
and
the
friar
there
and
rode
off
i
never
did
reach
daoud
he
hesitated
a
moment
eyeing
simon
then
smiled
a
hard
smile
without
warmth
or
mirth
i
got
your
precious
tartars
though
count
simon
simon
nodded
his
eyes
bitter
sordello
told
me
it
was
you
who
killed
them
he
took
a
step
toward
lorenzo
who
shook
the
crossbow
at
him
again
it
down
sophia
wanted
to
scream
yes
that
spy
of
yours
told
you
eh
lorenzo
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
sordello
body
he
was
trying
to
guard
them
at
the
time
he
did
a
bad
job
of
it
mère
de
dieu
was
all
simon
said
anger
reddened
his
face
but
he
was
looking
off
into
space
not
at
lorenzo
after
that
lorenzo
went
on
i
found
the
wagon
but
rachel
and
friar
mathieu
were
gone
i
found
another
riderless
horse
and
hitched
it
up
and
i
drove
the
wagon
into
the
forest
west
of
here
rachel
i
buried
your
chest
i
hope
i
remember
where
by
then
it
was
nightfall
i
used
my
forged
safe
conduct
to
get
me
back
into
benevento
then
i
had
to
dodge
the
mobs
of
drunken
frenchmen
running
wild
all
over
town
i
knew
where
you
were
staying
sophia
but
it
took
me
all
night
to
get
into
this
house
past
count
simon
guards
i
spent
hours
in
hiding
and
scrambling
about
on
rooftops
i
thought
i
would
die
of
fright
said
tilia
when
lorenzo
came
through
our
window
god
for
lorenzo
how
i
love
him
nothing
can
stop
him
nothing
can
kill
what
were
you
planning
to
do
with
these
people
when
you
came
here
count
lorenzo
said
turn
them
over
to
your
master
anjou
sophia
turned
to
look
at
simon
he
stood
composed
his
empty
hands
at
his
sides
his
face
pink
in
the
glow
from
the
fire
calm
as
a
statue
master
daoud
the
mameluke
asked
me
to
come
here
simon
said
put
your
crossbow
down
lorenzo
sophia
said
again
are
you
sure
sophia
this
crossbow
might
be
the
only
thing
that
keeps
us
from
getting
dragged
off
to
be
hanged
this
bastard
has
fifty
men
outside
greek
fire
blazed
in
sophia
brain
she
screamed
do
not
call
him
a
bastard
sophia
said
simon
wonderingly
thank
you
she
stood
trembling
but
almost
as
soon
as
the
words
flew
from
her
mouth
the
fit
of
rage
passed
must
be
going
but
she
had
done
no
harm
she
seemed
to
have
made
things
better
forgive
me
count
lorenzo
laid
the
crossbow
on
the
bed
it
was
rude
to
call
you
that
but
you
did
ruin
our
hope
of
victory
today
daoud
had
the
battle
won
he
almost
had
his
hands
on
your
bloody
charles
when
you
charged
out
of
the
hills
with
your
damned
army
and
now
the
king
i
served
for
twenty
years
and
my
good
friend
are
both
dead
he
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
that
was
hard
count
very
hard
it
was
simon
charge
that
turned
the
sophia
thought
it
was
because
of
me
that
he
entered
this
her
grief
grew
heavier
still
you
may
hold
those
things
against
me
said
simon
and
i
might
hold
against
you
the
deaths
of
john
and
philip
whom
i
dedicated
my
life
to
protecting
listening
to
that
grave
quiet
voice
sophia
realized
that
simon
no
longer
seemed
young
to
her
it
was
as
if
he
had
aged
many
years
since
she
had
seen
him
last
as
long
as
she
had
known
him
she
had
thought
of
him
as
a
boy
and
yet
from
what
she
was
hearing
if
charles
was
now
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
it
was
to
simon
that
he
owed
the
crown
but
i
know
who
really
killed
the
tartars
simon
went
on
it
was
charles
count
charles
now
king
charles
who
no
more
wants
to
make
war
on
islam
than
your
friend
daoud
did
charles
kept
the
tartars
with
himself
and
away
from
king
louis
and
he
let
them
go
out
on
the
field
while
the
battle
was
raging
no
doubt
hoping
they
would
die
lorenzo
frowned
you
mean
charles
used
me
to
get
rid
of
the
tartars
simon
nodded
he
could
not
have
known
it
would
be
you
but
he
made
sure
they
would
be
in
harm
way
charles
is
very
good
at
using
people
my
mother
warned
me
about
him
long
before
i
let
him
persuade
me
to
come
to
italy
to
guard
the
tartars
but
i
did
not
listen
but
now
how
are
we
going
to
get
all
of
you
safely
out
of
benevento
he
kept
coming
back
to
that
sophia
thought
he
seemed
determined
to
save
them
from
charles
vengeance
we
may
still
have
the
wagon
i
hid
out
in
the
forest
lorenzo
said
and
if
you
truly
mean
to
help
us
you
might
appropriate
a
horse
or
two
there
are
many
horses
hereabouts
whose
owners
will
never
need
them
again
i
can
write
you
a
genuine
that
will
get
you
past
officials
and
agents
simon
said
if
you
travel
quickly
enough
you
may
get
ahead
of
them
into
territory
still
friendly
to
you
there
may
be
no
army
left
to
oppose
charles
but
it
will
take
him
some
time
to
get
control
of
all
the
territory
he
has
won
where
might
you
go
sophia
took
rachel
hand
again
and
they
sat
on
the
bed
remembering
that
she
and
daoud
had
shared
this
bed
last
night
sophia
felt
the
heaped
stones
of
sorrow
weigh
heavier
still
will
never
hold
him
to
distract
herself
from
her
pain
she
tried
to
listen
to
what
people
around
her
were
saying
to
palermo
first
said
lorenzo
decisively
at
a
time
like
this
with
the
king
gone
every
family
must
fend
for
itself
i
want
to
get
to
mine
at
once
he
turned
to
rachel
and
his
mustache
stretched
in
one
of
the
smiles
sophia
had
seen
all
too
rarely
my
wife
fiorela
and
i
would
be
honored
to
have
you
as
a
member
of
our
family
rachel
rachel
gave
a
little
gasp
truly
truly
i
have
been
wanting
to
propose
it
for
a
long
time
again
sophia
thanked
god
for
lorenzo
she
almost
wished
he
would
offer
to
take
her
into
his
family
too
simon
stared
at
lorenzo
you
are
were
an
official
at
manfred
court
and
your
wife
name
is
fiorela
lorenzo
frowned
yes
count
what
of
it
simon
interest
puzzled
sophia
could
there
be
some
connection
between
him
and
lorenzo
we
must
speak
more
about
her
later
simon
flexed
his
arms
it
will
not
be
safe
for
you
to
try
to
leave
benevento
until
morning
i
will
see
to
it
that
my
men
guard
this
house
from
the
looters
till
then
they
will
not
of
course
know
who
is
in
here
with
me
meanwhile
you
all
had
better
sleep
if
you
can
weary
and
broken
by
sorrow
though
she
was
sophia
knew
that
to
try
to
lie
down
in
the
dark
would
mean
nothing
but
hours
of
suffering
she
would
sleep
only
when
she
fainted
from
exhaustion
and
she
dreaded
the
agony
she
would
feel
when
she
woke
again
and
remembered
what
had
happened
this
day
tilia
cleared
her
throat
politely
your
signory
it
will
be
hard
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
dead
bodies
simon
frowned
dead
bodies
well
i
hope
you
will
not
hold
it
against
myself
and
the
cardinal
but
besides
sordello
here
there
are
two
of
his
henchmen
in
the
room
we
have
been
occupying
also
dead
also
dead
they
were
trying
to
rob
us
now
sophia
remembered
that
sordello
had
brought
two
venetians
with
him
and
she
remembered
the
barks
and
growls
that
had
come
up
through
the
floorboards
while
she
was
alone
with
sordello
what
had
happened
down
there
between
ugolini
and
tilia
and
sordello
men
and
scipio
sophia
looked
at
tilia
and
noticed
that
she
wore
a
small
smile
of
satisfaction
and
was
fingering
her
jeweled
pectoral
cross
need
not
worry
about
she
thought
grimly
simon
sighed
there
must
be
a
basement
in
this
house
a
root
cellar
something
of
the
kind
lorenzo
you
and
i
will
find
a
place
to
take
the
bodies
the
room
grew
cold
with
sophia
and
rachel
alone
in
it
and
sophia
put
more
logs
on
the
fire
thankful
that
the
merchant
who
had
hurriedly
vacated
this
place
had
left
plenty
of
wood
she
lay
down
in
the
big
bed
beside
rachel
hesitantly
rachel
told
sophia
that
she
with
friar
mathieu
had
been
present
at
daoud
death
she
showed
sophia
the
little
leather
capsule
and
sophia
remembering
the
many
times
she
had
seen
it
around
neck
broke
into
a
fresh
storm
of
weeping
rachel
held
it
out
to
her
i
think
perhaps
you
should
be
the
one
to
have
it
no
he
gave
it
to
you
sophia
wiped
her
eyes
drew
out
the
locket
and
opened
it
looked
sadly
at
the
meaningless
tracery
of
lines
on
its
surface
barely
visible
in
the
light
from
the
low
fire
this
locket
is
what
he
gave
me
it
seems
the
magic
in
it
died
with
him
but
it
is
a
precious
keepsake
she
remembered
that
she
had
been
looking
at
the
locket
when
sordello
tried
to
kill
simon
why
had
he
tried
to
do
that
it
made
no
sense
but
because
of
it
she
had
killed
sordello
and
of
that
she
was
glad
she
had
avenged
daoud
desperately
needing
to
know
every
detail
of
daoud
death
sophia
questioned
rachel
until
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
the
girl
fell
asleep
sophia
lay
wide
awake
in
the
dark
crying
silently
lying
there
was
hell
as
she
had
expected
it
would
be
after
what
seemed
like
hours
the
fire
on
the
hearth
died
she
got
up
and
piled
three
bed
carpets
over
rachel
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
winter
cloak
and
slipped
out
of
the
room
going
she
knew
not
where
but
unable
to
remain
still
wanting
only
to
distract
herself
from
her
pain
with
a
little
movement
she
went
down
the
stairs
passing
the
silent
room
were
ugolini
and
tilia
lay
she
heard
men
voices
from
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
the
cabinet
of
the
merchant
who
owned
this
house
was
just
inside
the
front
door
there
sophia
found
simon
and
lorenzo
seated
facing
each
other
at
a
long
black
table
scipio
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
doorway
opened
one
eye
twitched
an
ear
at
her
and
went
back
to
sleep
with
a
quill
simon
was
writing
out
a
document
while
lorenzo
used
a
candle
flame
to
melt
sealing
wax
in
a
small
brass
pitcher
on
a
tripod
simon
gave
her
a
brief
sad
smile
he
had
taken
off
his
mail
and
wore
only
his
quilted
white
lorenzo
stood
up
went
to
a
sideboard
and
poured
a
cup
of
wine
silent
he
handed
it
to
sophia
it
was
sweeter
than
she
liked
but
it
warmed
her
she
took
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
two
men
sat
there
so
companionably
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
for
more
than
two
years
they
had
been
enemies
she
recalled
with
a
pang
how
daoud
had
said
he
no
longer
hated
simon
if
only
he
could
be
here
to
be
part
of
this
one
can
not
predict
these
things
lorenzo
said
continuing
the
conversation
that
had
begun
before
sophia
arrived
and
i
certainly
do
not
believe
in
trying
to
make
them
happen
but
my
son
orlando
is
at
a
good
age
for
marriage
and
so
is
rachel
simon
looked
up
from
his
writing
you
would
let
your
son
marry
a
woman
who
had
spent
over
a
year
in
a
brothel
lorenzo
gave
simon
a
level
look
yes
do
you
disapprove
simon
shook
his
head
from
what
i
know
of
rachel
not
at
all
but
there
are
many
who
would
knowing
lorenzo
celino
sophia
thought
warmly
she
was
not
surprised
that
he
did
not
feel
as
many
other
people
would
rachel
is
brave
intelligent
and
beautiful
said
lorenzo
what
happened
to
her
was
not
her
fault
and
now
she
knows
infinitely
more
of
the
world
than
most
women
if
she
should
take
an
interest
in
orlando
he
would
be
lucky
to
have
her
and
then
rachel
will
be
your
cousin
count
simon
she
will
surely
be
the
only
jewish
girl
in
all
europe
who
is
related
if
only
by
marriage
to
a
great
baron
of
france
sophia
frowned
at
lorenzo
cousin
what
was
the
man
talking
about
raising
his
head
from
his
scroll
simon
saw
her
look
and
smiled
i
have
just
discovered
sophia
that
lorenzo
celino
here
is
my
uncle
sophia
felt
somewhat
irritated
were
the
two
of
them
playing
a
sort
of
joke
on
her
no
it
true
sophia
said
lorenzo
my
wife
came
from
languedoc
years
ago
as
a
refugee
from
the
war
that
was
being
fought
there
at
the
time
her
maiden
name
was
fiorela
de
vency
and
her
older
brother
roland
de
vency
went
back
to
france
and
eventually
married
mother
making
him
simon
stepfather
so
you
see
i
am
simon
uncle
by
marriage
simon
smiled
broadly
roland
told
me
long
ago
that
he
had
a
sister
fiorela
who
was
married
to
a
high
official
of
manfred
i
would
far
far
rather
have
you
for
an
uncle
lorenzo
than
charles
whom
i
have
often
called
uncle
he
gave
sophia
a
meaningful
look
she
understood
simon
might
like
lorenzo
but
not
well
enough
to
tell
him
that
roland
de
vency
was
more
than
a
stepfather
to
him
and
therefore
lorenzo
wife
more
than
an
aunt
by
marriage
his
mother
and
father
and
his
confessor
know
that
he
once
weighed
down
with
grief
though
she
was
she
managed
to
smile
back
simon
put
down
his
quill
closed
the
lid
on
the
ink
pot
and
blew
on
the
parchment
to
dry
it
he
poured
red
wax
at
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
took
a
heavy
ring
off
his
finger
and
pressed
it
into
the
blob
he
handed
the
document
to
lorenzo
to
read
you
have
been
well
educated
said
lorenzo
you
write
as
handsomely
as
a
monk
charles
will
have
his
men
out
looking
for
you
as
one
of
ministers
said
simon
i
advise
you
not
to
wait
for
them
to
catch
up
with
you
in
palermo
of
course
charles
may
offer
you
a
chance
to
work
for
him
the
help
of
men
acquainted
with
manfred
regime
will
make
it
much
easier
for
him
to
take
over
lorenzo
mustache
twitched
as
he
smiled
sourly
work
for
him
i
know
you
do
not
know
me
well
but
i
hope
you
jest
otherwise
i
would
have
to
consider
myself
insulted
manfred
and
his
father
emperor
frederic
built
a
fair
and
civilized
land
here
learning
and
the
arts
of
peace
flourished
unchecked
by
superstition
charles
will
doubtless
destroy
all
that
i
propose
to
make
it
very
hard
for
him
to
hold
on
to
what
he
has
conquered
this
day
anjou
will
not
thank
you
if
he
learns
it
was
you
who
turned
me
loose
see
that
he
does
not
learn
it
then
lorenzo
frowned
you
won
the
battle
for
charles
now
you
seem
willing
to
do
him
all
sorts
of
mischief
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
fixed
simon
with
his
piercing
dark
eyes
why
sophia
leaned
forward
too
eager
to
hear
simon
answer
simon
sighed
and
smiled
because
today
at
last
i
saw
through
with
me
in
the
matter
of
the
tartars
his
smile
was
a
very
sad
one
and
i
want
to
help
you
out
of
what
i
still
feel
for
sophia
sophia
felt
the
tide
of
sorrow
rise
again
within
her
her
mouth
trembled
and
her
eyes
burned
simon
was
looking
down
at
the
table
now
to
her
relief
and
did
not
see
her
response
to
his
words
he
might
have
been
looking
away
she
thought
to
hide
the
tears
in
his
own
eyes
lorenzo
stood
up
briskly
i
am
going
to
try
to
find
an
empty
bed
or
a
soft
carpet
for
a
few
hours
sleep
tomorrow
we
leave
early
and
we
travel
far
after
he
and
scipio
had
gone
simon
said
i
loved
you
at
least
i
loved
a
woman
who
had
your
face
and
form
but
did
not
really
exist
against
my
will
i
have
asked
myself
since
i
saw
you
again
tonight
if
there
is
any
way
that
dream
of
mine
could
be
salvaged
have
you
thought
about
that
sophia
shook
her
head
in
her
heart
there
was
room
for
nothing
but
pain
she
said
just
as
you
wish
you
had
not
been
the
cause
of
daoud
death
so
i
wish
i
had
not
hurt
you
so
but
that
is
all
i
can
say
simon
a
dream
may
be
very
beautiful
but
it
is
still
only
a
dream
i
suppose
we
are
lucky
that
we
can
sit
here
and
talk
about
it
you
and
i
and
that
we
are
not
trying
to
kill
each
other
that
is
not
luck
that
is
because
of
who
we
are
simon
one
thing
hurts
me
very
much
i
do
not
know
what
happened
to
daoud
after
he
died
is
there
any
way
i
could
see
him
his
eyes
big
and
dark
with
sadness
he
shook
his
head
even
if
you
could
the
body
of
a
man
dead
many
hours
of
wounds
is
a
terrible
sight
and
then
that
would
be
your
last
memory
of
him
you
would
not
want
that
would
not
want
that
and
if
you
went
near
the
bodies
of
manfred
dead
you
would
be
in
great
danger
someone
might
recognize
you
remember
that
many
who
served
manfred
will
be
eager
to
get
into
charles
good
graces
you
must
protect
yourself
she
did
not
care
about
protecting
herself
what
will
happen
to
daoud
what
will
they
do
to
him
she
realized
she
was
still
talking
of
daoud
as
if
he
were
alive
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
daoud
body
the
men
who
died
fighting
for
manfred
will
be
buried
on
the
battlefield
said
simon
they
can
not
be
buried
in
consecrated
ground
because
those
who
were
christians
were
excommunicated
under
the
interdict
and
many
like
daoud
were
saracens
i
believe
king
charles
is
planning
some
special
honor
for
manfred
body
manfred
body
hearing
those
words
the
enormity
of
what
had
been
lost
beyond
her
own
sorrow
came
home
to
her
and
what
of
daoud
spirit
she
wondered
did
she
believe
that
a
part
of
him
was
still
alive
had
he
gone
to
his
muslim
warrior
paradise
if
she
were
carrying
his
child
would
he
want
her
to
raise
it
as
her
own
she
realized
that
she
was
crying
again
how
could
her
eyes
produce
so
great
a
flood
of
tears
she
heard
footsteps
and
felt
simon
hand
resting
lightly
but
firmly
on
her
shoulder
she
dropped
her
head
to
her
arms
folded
on
the
table
and
gave
herself
up
to
sobbing
lxxii
simon
carrying
the
heaviest
rock
he
could
hold
walked
in
procession
directly
behind
charles
they
came
to
the
low
wooden
platform
where
the
body
of
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
lay
covered
by
his
great
yellow
banner
with
its
black
eagle
charles
set
his
foot
in
a
handsome
purple
boot
on
the
banner
and
leaned
over
the
body
with
a
large
stone
requiescat
in
pace
may
you
rest
in
peace
manfred
von
hohenstaufen
carefully
charles
set
the
rock
down
on
the
figure
and
stepped
back
with
a
small
smile
of
satisfaction
now
you
simon
simon
stepped
onto
the
platform
his
arms
stiff
and
sore
from
yesterday
fighting
ached
as
he
lifted
the
stone
to
place
it
he
laid
it
next
to
charles
rock
on
the
inert
hidden
form
and
stepped
back
gautier
du
mont
of
the
haircut
was
next
he
bowed
to
charles
and
simon
and
put
his
rock
beside
theirs
simon
come
with
me
said
charles
we
have
had
no
chance
to
talk
since
yesterday
he
led
simon
to
a
small
nearby
hill
where
they
could
watch
the
long
line
of
charles
army
winding
single
file
through
the
gray
valley
of
benevento
under
an
overcast
sky
each
man
by
order
carried
a
stone
to
lay
on
manfred
cairn
if
not
for
you
manfred
would
be
burying
me
today
simon
said
charles
his
large
eyes
solemn
i
am
in
your
debt
forever
for
my
kingdom
and
my
life
should
make
this
a
bit
easier
for
thank
you
sire
du
mont
and
fitztrinian
fourre
and
de
marion
laid
their
stones
as
charles
and
simon
watched
the
burgundian
von
regensburg
had
been
killed
yesterday
impaled
on
a
saracen
foot
soldier
spear
simon
felt
little
regret
at
his
passing
we
are
burying
manfred
as
our
pagan
ancestors
were
buried
said
charles
but
i
hope
this
gesture
of
respect
helps
reconcile
his
former
subjects
to
me
i
fear
trouble
with
them
it
has
already
started
last
night
after
the
battle
several
men
died
mysteriously
oh
said
simon
the
death
that
shocked
me
most
was
de
verceuil
simon
was
amazed
the
cardinal
he
could
hardly
believe
it
he
remembered
de
verceuil
departure
just
after
the
cardinal
had
killed
manfred
as
simon
and
daoud
were
beginning
their
final
combat
poisoned
said
charles
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
done
by
followers
or
by
an
enemy
of
his
in
our
own
ranks
you
had
not
heard
no
even
though
one
expected
to
hear
after
a
battle
of
untimely
deaths
simon
blood
ran
cold
with
shock
de
verceuil
did
not
seem
the
sort
to
oblige
his
fellow
men
by
dying
unexpectedly
a
cold
wind
blew
across
simon
neck
and
whipped
the
bright
purple
woolen
cloak
charles
was
wearing
charles
touched
his
hand
to
his
gold
crown
larger
than
the
count
coronet
he
had
worn
on
state
occasions
in
the
past
as
if
fearing
that
it
might
blow
away
he
went
to
the
tartars
tent
looking
for
them
before
we
learned
they
had
been
killed
charles
said
saw
a
jar
of
wine
on
the
table
he
was
thirsty
after
the
fighting
and
took
a
long
drink
straight
out
of
the
jar
those
who
saw
him
said
that
in
an
instant
his
skin
turned
hot
and
red
first
he
cried
out
that
he
was
blind
then
he
raved
about
terrible
visions
and
began
laying
about
wildly
with
his
mace
so
that
his
attendants
were
forced
to
flee
then
he
went
into
convulsions
and
within
the
hour
he
was
dead
simon
remembered
lorenzo
saying
something
about
having
gone
to
the
tartars
tent
was
going
to
make
doubly
sure
he
killed
them
this
time
instead
he
killed
manfred
a
tragedy
simon
said
sorry
that
despite
the
duty
of
christian
charity
he
could
feel
no
sorrow
then
there
was
sordello
your
captain
of
archers
who
guarded
the
tartars
did
you
not
hear
about
him
he
has
not
been
under
my
command
since
i
left
the
tartars
with
you
in
rome
said
simon
he
kept
trying
to
think
about
de
verceuil
and
prayed
that
his
face
would
not
give
away
his
knowledge
of
how
sordello
died
he
and
two
of
his
men
were
found
this
morning
in
a
building
in
town
sordello
had
a
small
puncture
in
his
throat
and
one
of
the
others
had
been
stabbed
in
the
chest
with
a
very
thin
blade
one
of
my
looked
at
the
bodies
and
believes
both
of
them
were
killed
with
poisoned
implements
and
it
appeared
the
throat
of
the
third
had
been
torn
out
by
the
fangs
of
some
enormous
beast
perhaps
a
watchdog
said
simon
after
all
when
troops
are
turned
loose
on
a
town
one
must
expect
that
a
few
of
the
citizens
will
fight
back
i
am
sorry
to
lose
sordello
said
charles
a
despicable
man
but
often
useful
the
rocks
covered
manfred
body
completely
now
only
the
edges
of
the
yellow
banner
were
still
showing
those
who
had
placed
their
stones
stood
around
in
groups
to
watch
the
cairn
grow
these
sicilians
will
not
settle
down
until
the
remaining
hohenstaufens
are
out
of
the
way
said
charles
manfred
has
three
sons
and
a
daughter
i
have
to
find
them
and
lock
them
up
too
bad
i
can
not
have
them
executed
but
they
are
just
children
simon
prayed
that
manfred
children
escaped
from
charles
he
stood
facing
charles
knowing
that
he
was
as
tall
as
the
new
king
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
and
that
he
no
longer
felt
afraid
of
him
fighting
in
this
battle
his
at
daoud
hands
the
shock
and
pain
of
what
sophia
had
told
him
all
together
these
things
had
changed
him
he
no
longer
doubted
that
he
deserved
to
be
the
count
de
gobignon
it
did
not
matter
who
his
real
father
was
what
mattered
was
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
world
who
could
rule
gobignon
as
well
as
he
in
the
past
two
years
he
had
become
the
count
de
gobignon
in
truth
as
well
as
in
title
and
now
all
he
wanted
was
to
go
back
to
his
domain
to
bring
up
the
subject
simon
said
friar
mathieu
is
most
grieved
at
the
deaths
of
the
tartar
ambassadors
but
it
means
you
no
longer
need
him
here
he
has
asked
me
to
take
him
back
to
france
with
me
he
has
permission
from
his
order
to
go
he
wants
to
tell
king
louis
in
person
about
his
journey
among
the
tartars
and
he
wants
to
spend
his
remaining
years
in
france
as
for
me
i
am
eager
to
see
my
mother
and
stepfather
in
provence
that
i
can
face
them
with
a
clear
charles
frowned
throwing
his
head
back
and
staring
down
his
long
nose
at
simon
you
want
to
go
back
to
france
now
but
our
work
here
has
only
begun
if
you
wish
to
offer
any
of
my
vassals
fiefdoms
or
positions
in
your
new
kingdom
they
have
my
leave
to
accept
i
promised
them
that
when
they
came
with
me
but
you
can
not
leave
before
taking
possession
of
your
own
dukedom
thank
you
sire
but
i
have
decided
that
for
myself
i
want
nothing
he
had
rehearsed
that
sentence
in
his
mind
a
hundred
times
he
was
delighted
at
the
sound
of
it
and
even
more
delighted
at
the
stupefied
expression
on
charles
face
it
was
not
often
one
surprised
a
man
like
charles
but
that
is
preposterous
you
have
come
all
this
way
won
this
great
victory
has
your
head
been
addled
by
chivalrous
romances
this
is
not
the
world
of
arthur
and
lancelot
simon
recalled
manfred
last
stand
on
the
field
yesterday
and
thought
that
world
ended
with
surely
charles
keeping
himself
well
out
of
the
battle
and
threatened
only
when
daoud
desperately
tried
to
reach
him
had
been
no
figure
out
of
chivalric
romance
this
was
a
man
he
could
not
trust
could
not
admire
and
especially
could
not
like
too
true
sire
but
it
is
a
world
in
which
people
need
decent
rulers
i
do
not
need
more
land
and
the
land
i
already
have
needs
me
if
i
divide
myself
between
a
domain
in
northern
france
and
another
one
here
in
italy
i
can
not
govern
either
well
and
frankly
i
do
not
want
to
live
in
the
midst
of
a
strange
people
as
a
foreign
conqueror
up
this
dukedom
too
gives
me
a
better
right
to
be
count
de
you
overestimate
the
difficulty
of
governing
said
charles
you
underestimate
thought
simon
for
charles
governing
was
a
simple
matter
of
squeezing
the
people
and
their
land
for
all
they
were
worth
and
killing
anyone
who
protested
as
he
had
those
citizens
outside
rome
if
the
people
were
strange
to
him
all
the
easier
to
oppress
them
perhaps
what
comes
easily
to
you
is
difficult
for
me
sire
he
said
charles
shook
his
head
then
quickly
reached
up
to
steady
the
heavy
crown
i
do
not
understand
you
but
that
province
is
too
valuable
for
me
to
press
it
on
someone
who
does
not
want
it
i
can
use
it
to
reward
others
who
have
served
me
not
as
well
as
you
have
but
well
enough
i
hoped
you
might
see
it
that
way
but
think
since
i
asked
you
to
guard
the
tartars
it
has
been
nearly
three
years
you
have
taken
part
in
great
affairs
and
you
have
added
to
your
reputation
and
restored
luster
to
your
family
name
you
have
led
your
gobignon
vassals
to
a
victory
that
has
brought
them
glory
and
riches
you
have
i
tell
you
again
won
my
lifelong
gratitude
why
separate
yourself
from
all
that
now
by
what
you
did
yesterday
you
wiped
out
the
stain
on
your
family
name
your
father
betrayed
his
king
and
his
crusader
comrades
but
now
you
have
won
a
victory
for
a
crusade
and
saved
the
life
of
a
king
but
how
different
those
crusades
and
how
different
those
he
kept
reminding
himself
that
manfred
was
an
enemy
of
the
pope
and
daoud
an
enemy
of
christendom
but
the
thought
haunted
him
that
through
him
great
men
and
a
noble
kingdom
had
fallen
again
and
again
he
tried
to
push
out
of
his
mind
the
idea
that
he
had
been
wrong
to
come
here
and
fight
on
the
side
of
anjou
but
he
knew
it
would
remain
with
him
troubling
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
if
you
want
to
show
gratitude
to
me
sire
the
one
favor
i
ask
is
that
you
not
press
me
to
stay
charles
fumbled
in
a
heavy
purse
at
his
belt
and
drew
out
a
long
silver
chain
he
held
it
out
to
simon
here
i
want
you
to
have
this
at
least
simon
bowed
gravely
and
held
out
his
hand
attached
to
the
chain
was
a
star
with
a
large
round
ruby
in
its
center
beautiful
thank
you
very
much
sire
it
was
manfred
he
prized
it
highly
i
am
told
called
it
his
of
destiny
you
earned
it
i
think
by
giving
me
victory
yesterday
i
hope
it
brings
you
a
better
destiny
than
it
did
him
uneasily
feeling
that
the
star
was
property
stolen
from
a
dead
man
simon
took
it
he
unbuckled
the
purse
at
his
belt
to
drop
it
in
put
it
on
charles
urged
reluctantly
simon
hung
the
star
around
his
neck
i
will
treasure
it
he
said
tonelessly
it
is
little
enough
if
you
will
only
consider
staying
with
me
you
will
share
in
spoils
that
will
make
that
look
like
a
trinket
city
by
city
i
am
going
to
take
over
not
just
this
kingdom
but
northern
italy
too
i
will
unite
all
of
italy
the
papacy
will
be
solidly
under
french
control
and
then
constantinople
i
bought
the
title
of
emperor
of
constantinople
from
baldwin
ii
when
he
fled
to
paris
after
michael
paleologos
deposed
him
the
name
of
michael
paleologos
was
like
a
blow
to
simon
stomach
probably
it
was
no
more
than
a
name
to
charles
but
simon
could
hear
sophia
saying
she
had
been
that
same
michael
concubine
for
a
time
he
suffered
again
as
he
had
last
night
when
he
stood
with
her
on
the
balcony
of
that
house
and
she
told
him
at
last
the
truth
about
herself
he
had
felt
then
as
if
he
were
drowning
in
a
lake
of
fire
and
added
to
his
own
anguish
had
been
the
realization
that
her
pain
the
pain
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
still
loved
had
been
worse
than
the
worst
of
what
he
felt
charles
was
still
going
on
about
his
accursed
ambitions
i
mean
to
make
that
title
a
reality
not
since
rome
will
so
many
lands
around
the
middle
sea
have
been
united
in
one
empire
the
vision
moved
simon
but
not
as
charles
evidently
hoped
it
sickened
him
and
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
monster
had
charles
forgotten
already
the
heaps
of
corpses
strewn
on
this
battlefield
at
dawn
that
only
now
were
being
hauled
away
by
the
wagonload
simon
remembered
the
long
list
of
the
gobignon
dead
that
thierry
had
handed
him
this
morning
on
his
return
to
camp
he
thought
of
the
horribly
wounded
knights
and
men
he
had
visited
men
who
if
god
was
kind
to
them
would
be
dead
in
a
day
or
two
his
eyes
still
burned
from
all
the
weeping
he
had
done
this
barely
begun
day
and
this
man
who
had
made
the
rescue
of
the
holy
land
the
defeat
of
islam
and
the
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
seem
to
him
now
spoke
of
sacrificing
thousands
and
thousands
more
lives
entrusted
to
him
so
that
he
could
realize
his
dream
of
being
another
caesar
grant
that
he
does
not
get
what
he
the
wind
from
the
north
blew
steadily
down
the
length
of
the
valley
the
pile
of
rocks
over
manfred
body
had
grown
so
high
the
men
now
had
to
throw
their
stones
to
reach
the
top
what
of
our
plans
to
liberate
the
holy
land
sire
what
about
the
alliance
of
tartars
and
christians
that
is
what
i
gave
the
last
three
years
of
my
life
to
surely
that
is
not
dead
because
john
and
philip
had
the
ill
luck
to
get
killed
on
this
battlefield
charles
pulled
his
purple
cloak
tighter
around
him
against
the
wind
the
timing
is
wrong
for
an
attempt
to
retake
the
holy
land
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
part
in
a
crusade
against
the
egyptians
with
or
without
the
tartars
there
it
was
charles
had
confirmed
what
simon
suspected
about
him
he
felt
indignation
boiling
within
him
but
he
tried
not
to
let
it
sound
in
his
voice
sire
why
did
you
let
the
tartars
go
into
the
battle
yesterday
and
lose
their
lives
charles
eyes
narrowed
i
know
what
grief
you
must
feel
having
guarded
them
so
carefully
for
so
long
but
they
insisted
they
had
fought
against
christians
so
now
they
wanted
to
see
how
a
battle
looks
from
our
side
they
knew
the
risks
they
had
been
warriors
all
their
lives
they
were
my
guests
and
i
had
to
let
them
do
what
they
wanted
simon
looked
out
at
the
valley
the
line
of
men
carrying
rocks
to
manfred
cairn
stretched
far
into
the
distance
disappearing
finally
beyond
the
crests
of
rolling
fields
the
line
still
looked
as
long
as
ever
it
wound
past
a
long
narrow
mound
of
freshly
turned
brown
earth
the
mass
grave
dug
at
dawn
by
prisoners
for
the
dead
of
army
the
man
called
daoud
simon
still
thought
of
him
as
david
who
for
more
than
two
years
had
fought
simon
relentlessly
lay
somewhere
under
that
mound
of
earth
the
man
sophia
had
loved
near
at
hand
the
soldiers
who
had
added
their
rocks
to
the
pile
were
dismantling
manfred
camp
tents
collapsed
in
flurries
of
colored
cloth
these
fighting
men
and
king
louis
could
have
added
twice
as
many
to
these
what
could
they
not
have
accomplished
if
they
had
invaded
palestine
at
the
same
time
a
tartar
army
struck
at
the
saracens
from
the
east
he
decided
to
probe
further
now
there
can
be
no
planning
for
a
crusade
until
the
next
ambassadors
come
from
tartary
is
that
your
wish
charles
smiled
oh
eventually
we
will
want
to
make
war
on
the
saracens
after
italy
is
united
after
the
byzantine
empire
is
ours
once
more
toward
that
day
we
want
to
maintain
the
bonds
of
friendship
with
the
tartars
if
they
send
us
more
ambassadors
we
will
treat
them
royally
and
shower
them
with
fair
words
and
send
them
home
with
nothing
simon
added
for
now
charles
agreed
for
now
instead
of
planning
war
with
egypt
i
believe
it
is
more
in
my
interest
to
do
as
the
hohenstaufens
did
when
they
ruled
sicily
cultivate
friendly
relations
with
the
sultan
of
cairo
simon
was
silent
for
a
moment
amazed
that
anjou
could
be
so
open
about
his
lack
of
principle
he
felt
his
face
grow
hot
and
his
voice
quiver
as
his
anger
forced
its
way
to
the
surface
everything
you
have
done
and
said
has
been
for
one
purpose
only
to
make
yourself
king
of
sicily
i
guessed
as
much
and
now
i
know
and
that
is
why
i
do
not
want
a
dukedom
in
your
kingdom
because
i
do
not
want
to
be
used
by
you
anymore
charles
drew
himself
up
and
fixed
simon
with
an
angry
stare
curb
your
tongue
messire
you
may
be
the
count
de
gobignon
but
you
owe
me
the
respect
due
a
king
you
are
not
my
king
thank
god
simon
retorted
my
king
your
brother
king
louis
taught
me
that
each
and
every
man
and
woman
on
earth
is
precious
to
god
that
a
king
duty
is
to
care
for
his
people
not
use
them
as
if
they
were
cattle
a
good
philosophy
for
the
next
world
said
charles
scornfully
it
is
the
philosophy
by
which
your
brother
rules
in
this
world
said
simon
fiercely
and
that
is
why
everyone
loves
him
not
just
his
own
french
subjects
but
all
christians
charles
olive
skin
darkened
to
a
purple
shade
consider
this
messire
when
louis
last
went
to
war
he
led
a
whole
army
to
destruction
in
egypt
when
i
go
to
war
i
lead
my
army
to
victory
and
the
spoils
of
a
fair
and
prosperous
kingdom
louis
was
born
a
king
i
made
myself
a
king
now
which
of
us
is
the
better
ruler
answer
me
that
simon
stared
at
charles
engorged
face
and
felt
dizzy
with
triumph
not
only
had
he
lost
all
fear
of
charles
but
he
had
broken
through
charles
mask
of
regal
authority
and
had
provoked
him
to
reveal
his
naked
envy
of
his
brother
he
answered
quietly
you
might
conquer
this
whole
world
and
my
sovereign
seigneur
king
louis
would
still
be
a
better
king
than
you
are
and
a
better
man
charles
stared
at
simon
his
eyes
huge
and
thick
veins
standing
out
in
his
temples
simon
stared
back
keeping
himself
outwardly
calm
but
inwardly
exulting
in
his
new
freedom
is
nothing
i
need
prove
to
this
man
or
to
anyone
else
i
am
the
last
bond
of
loyalty
between
himself
and
charles
was
broken
the
silence
stretched
on
until
it
seemed
to
simon
that
this
was
the
longest
moment
of
his
life
charles
blinked
and
let
out
several
long
breaths
ah
well
as
god
is
my
witness
you
and
my
brother
are
two
of
a
kind
you
deserve
each
other
he
shook
his
arms
which
he
had
been
holding
rigid
at
his
sides
and
reached
up
and
tapped
the
crown
down
more
firmly
on
his
head
lumps
me
with
king
louis
he
does
not
know
the
great
honor
he
does
charles
said
i
hope
for
the
sake
of
what
we
have
been
to
each
other
that
you
will
be
discreet
about
what
i
have
said
to
you
if
you
visit
my
brother
when
you
go
back
to
france
you
must
not
cause
ill
will
between
him
and
me
i
doubt
that
even
if
i
wished
to
i
could
cause
bad
feeling
between
you
simon
said
he
has
known
you
all
your
life
and
if
he
has
not
broken
with
you
by
now
it
must
be
because
he
loves
you
too
much
he
turned
abruptly
and
left
charles
standing
alone
on
his
little
hill
the
star
swung
at
his
neck
and
he
thought
of
going
back
and
throwing
it
at
charles
feet
but
no
he
decided
he
would
keep
it
and
honor
manfred
memory
the
grief
of
these
two
days
still
darkened
his
world
but
there
was
one
small
brightness
he
might
not
have
accomplished
anything
to
liberate
the
holy
land
but
he
had
freed
himself
from
charles
it
hurt
simon
to
see
sophia
face
her
eyelids
were
red
and
puffed
her
cheeks
were
hollow
and
her
lips
pale
she
was
still
beautiful
but
it
was
a
sorrowful
beauty
like
that
of
a
grieving
madonna
i
see
you
are
wearing
manfred
star
sophia
said
forgive
me
he
felt
a
flash
of
hatred
for
himself
how
stupid
of
him
she
must
think
he
was
wearing
it
like
a
captured
trophy
he
said
charles
gave
it
to
me
i
swear
to
you
i
mean
no
disrespect
to
manfred
just
the
opposite
it
must
hurt
you
to
see
it
how
thoughtless
of
me
anjou
insisted
on
my
putting
it
around
my
neck
just
now
i
am
only
going
to
keep
it
safe
in
memory
of
manfred
not
wear
it
let
me
take
it
off
are
he
told
himself
no
she
said
touching
his
hand
lightly
briefly
no
one
has
a
better
right
to
wear
it
than
you
simon
said
i
want
you
to
know
this
daoud
succeeded
what
do
you
mean
succeeded
how
they
stood
just
outside
the
walls
of
benevento
by
the
side
of
the
road
leading
to
the
south
a
group
of
charles
past
whom
simon
had
just
escorted
sophia
and
her
friends
lounged
before
the
gate
last
night
i
suspected
it
but
this
morning
i
talked
to
anjou
and
now
i
am
certain
there
will
never
be
an
alliance
of
christians
and
tartars
anjou
never
wanted
it
and
he
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
prevent
it
it
would
interfere
with
his
own
ambitions
her
amber
eyes
looked
into
his
and
he
felt
the
pain
she
was
holding
rigidly
at
bay
within
herself
oh
god
those
eyes
how
he
had
dreamed
of
spending
the
rest
of
his
life
in
their
gaze
now
after
today
he
would
never
look
into
them
again
she
said
does
it
disappoint
you
that
there
will
be
no
alliance
once
it
would
have
after
all
i
gave
everything
i
had
to
trying
to
make
the
alliance
succeed
but
i
did
that
for
king
louis
and
for
my
own
honor
more
than
because
i
believed
the
alliance
was
a
good
thing
indeed
i
often
had
doubts
i
pray
my
people
will
never
take
part
in
such
horrors
as
the
tartars
have
committed
sophia
shook
her
head
if
you
are
right
then
i
only
wish
daoud
could
have
known
before
he
died
that
his
purpose
was
accomplished
the
thought
came
to
simon
that
daoud
might
be
aware
of
that
in
the
next
world
but
it
seemed
a
childish
fancy
in
the
face
of
her
sorrow
and
he
said
nothing
even
now
she
thought
only
of
daoud
oh
why
could
not
everything
be
different
why
could
she
not
be
the
cardinal
niece
the
lovely
woman
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
why
must
she
be
a
stranger
with
a
greek
name
he
had
already
forgotten
because
he
had
heard
it
only
once
a
plotter
a
spy
an
enemy
he
looked
at
the
jagged
blue
mountains
mostly
bare
rock
that
rose
behind
sophia
and
in
despair
thought
of
climbing
up
there
and
throwing
himself
off
a
cliff
the
road
she
would
be
taking
led
into
those
mountains
celino
mounted
on
a
sturdy
brown
mare
held
sophia
chestnut
horse
for
her
ugolini
and
tilia
caballo
dressed
in
dark
peasants
clothes
sat
together
on
the
driver
seat
of
celino
cart
tilia
holding
the
reins
where
were
those
two
going
simon
wondered
when
he
said
to
them
he
had
not
thought
to
ask
no
place
in
sicily
would
be
safe
for
them
well
they
probably
would
not
have
wanted
to
tell
him
rachel
sitting
on
a
black
mule
gave
simon
a
little
smile
and
a
nod
when
he
glanced
her
way
he
smiled
back
you
find
a
good
man
celino
son
or
another
and
may
the
rest
of
your
life
be
entirely
you
are
going
back
to
constantinople
then
he
said
to
sophia
he
had
to
drag
the
words
out
of
himself
she
nodded
i
can
get
a
ship
from
palermo
rachel
has
kindly
offered
to
pay
my
passage
lorenzo
found
the
chest
full
of
gold
she
got
from
the
tartar
right
where
he
buried
it
out
in
the
woods
so
rachel
is
still
rich
as
for
me
i
am
quite
destitute
mantle
that
never
occurred
to
me
what
an
idiot
i
would
you
she
raised
a
hand
to
silence
him
and
shook
her
head
i
would
not
he
shrugged
and
nodded
take
this
from
me
at
least
a
warning
to
your
emperor
charles
wants
constantinople
he
has
a
claim
to
the
crown
of
byzantium
he
told
me
just
today
that
he
means
to
do
to
michael
what
he
did
to
manfred
sophia
gave
him
a
crooked
little
smile
michael
will
never
let
him
even
get
near
constantinople
i
hope
i
can
help
with
that
if
ever
i
can
do
anything
for
you
her
smile
grew
wider
do
not
be
too
quick
to
promise
that
simon
if
we
ever
meet
again
we
may
be
on
opposite
sides
in
a
softer
sadder
tone
she
added
again
he
took
a
step
closer
to
her
if
so
i
will
not
be
so
easily
deceived
now
i
know
the
real
sophia
the
one
who
did
not
love
me
her
smile
fell
away
i
think
the
real
sophia
did
love
you
simon
every
time
you
told
me
how
you
loved
me
it
was
as
if
you
were
taking
me
up
to
a
mountaintop
and
showing
me
a
beautiful
land
i
could
never
enter
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
because
i
could
not
enter
neither
could
you
we
were
both
barred
forever
from
happiness
the
look
on
her
face
made
him
want
to
burst
out
weeping
he
held
his
breath
and
pressed
his
lips
together
hard
to
stifle
the
sob
when
he
was
able
to
speak
he
said
i
think
i
would
have
loved
the
real
sophia
if
i
could
have
known
her
she
shut
her
eyes
as
if
in
terrible
pain
and
pressed
the
palms
of
her
hands
against
her
stomach
he
reached
out
to
take
sophia
in
his
arms
but
she
stepped
back
from
him
and
he
saw
that
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
pale
cheeks
she
held
out
her
hand
he
clasped
her
cold
hand
in
both
of
his
and
said
i
will
never
forget
you
the
sun
was
setting
in
the
desert
to
the
west
of
el
kahira
the
guarded
one
giving
a
red
tint
to
the
white
dust
that
drifted
above
the
many
roads
that
led
to
this
city
tilia
caballo
sat
on
a
silk
cushion
by
the
pool
in
the
vast
interior
garden
of
the
palace
of
the
sultan
known
as
the
multicolored
palace
because
its
walls
and
floors
were
inlaid
with
many
different
kinds
of
marble
and
its
ceilings
painted
in
azure
and
gold
tilia
dabbled
her
hand
in
the
pool
and
breathed
deep
of
the
scent
of
jasmine
a
fountain
threw
white
water
high
in
the
air
and
orange
and
black
fish
circled
in
the
rippling
pool
in
the
shadows
nearby
a
peacock
screamed
she
heard
footsteps
behind
her
the
merest
glance
over
her
shoulder
told
her
who
it
was
and
she
swiftly
turned
and
knelt
pressing
her
forehead
and
the
palms
of
her
hands
against
the
cool
blue
tiles
she
saw
the
pointed
toes
of
scarlet
boots
before
her
she
raised
her
head
a
bit
and
saw
the
boots
themselves
leather
tilia
the
voice
made
her
shiver
el
malik
dahir
she
addressed
him
god
blesses
our
meeting
tilia
she
sat
back
and
he
lowered
himself
to
a
position
facing
her
in
the
ten
years
since
she
had
last
seen
him
he
had
aged
little
he
had
won
the
battle
of
the
well
of
goliath
had
made
himself
sultan
and
had
reigned
over
a
kingdom
threatened
from
east
and
west
yet
his
yellow
face
was
unlined
and
there
was
no
gray
in
his
drooping
red
mustache
she
looked
at
the
white
scar
that
ran
vertically
down
his
blind
right
eye
then
she
looked
at
his
good
left
eye
and
saw
that
it
was
still
bright
blue
and
clear
forgive
me
tilia
for
not
being
able
to
greet
you
when
you
arrived
in
el
kahira
i
was
inspecting
the
crusaders
defenses
at
antioch
from
the
inside
she
laughed
amazing
that
such
a
man
should
manage
again
and
again
to
move
among
his
enemies
in
disguise
but
he
had
been
doing
it
most
of
his
life
my
lord
travels
far
and
fast
as
always
you
have
traveled
farther
you
are
comfortable
who
could
fail
to
be
comfortable
under
baibars
tent
and
cardinal
ugolini
will
he
be
happy
here
the
happiest
he
has
ever
been
he
spends
his
days
in
your
zahiriya
reading
ancient
manuscripts
talking
to
the
scholars
working
with
the
philosophical
instruments
he
hardly
sleeps
the
sooner
he
might
return
to
the
house
of
learning
you
built
ah
we
must
find
a
strong
young
slave
to
comfort
you
if
your
cardinal
does
not
spend
enough
time
in
your
bed
i
am
not
the
voracious
woman
you
bought
from
a
brothel
so
many
years
ago
my
lord
adelberto
can
satisfy
my
waning
desires
baibars
laughed
a
rumbling
sound
anything
you
want
tilia
in
all
the
sultanate
of
el
kahira
is
yours
you
have
served
me
well
you
took
a
prisoner
and
a
slave
and
trusted
her
you
sent
her
jewels
and
gold
in
a
steady
stream
you
helped
her
to
achieve
riches
and
power
in
the
very
heart
of
christendom
why
should
i
not
serve
you
with
all
my
might
since
you
sent
me
from
here
long
ago
i
have
not
had
the
chance
to
see
you
with
my
own
eyes
and
speak
aloud
my
gratitude
to
you
and
now
that
i
am
with
you
words
fail
me
if
i
spoke
for
a
thousand
and
one
nights
i
could
not
say
enough
to
thank
you
to
praise
you
baibars
shrugged
do
you
not
regret
losing
it
all
you
can
not
open
a
brothel
here
in
el
kahira
tilia
i
have
closed
all
the
brothels
his
eyelids
crinkled
humorously
i
am
a
very
strict
muslim
these
days
i
am
ready
to
retire
my
lord
ready
to
drop
all
pretense
and
come
back
here
just
to
be
myself
baibars
wide
mouth
drew
down
the
lips
so
thin
that
the
line
they
drew
seemed
just
a
slash
across
the
bottom
of
his
face
now
that
you
are
here
tilia
now
that
we
are
i
want
to
hear
from
you
the
story
of
daoud
i
want
to
hear
all
of
it
all
that
you
had
no
room
to
tell
me
in
your
messages
take
as
long
as
you
like
ask
for
anything
that
will
make
you
comfortable
my
ears
are
for
you
and
for
no
one
else
i
am
my
lord
slave
i
shall
tell
it
to
you
as
it
happened
to
me
she
settled
herself
on
the
cushion
i
first
met
daoud
ibn
abdallah
in
the
hills
outside
orvieto
on
an
afternoon
in
late
summer
three
years
ago
tilia
stopped
her
tale
twice
so
that
she
and
baibars
could
pray
when
the
muezzins
called
the
faithful
to
prayer
at
maghrib
after
the
red
of
sunset
had
left
the
sky
and
again
at
when
it
was
dark
enough
that
a
white
thread
could
not
be
told
from
a
black
thread
after
the
final
prayer
of
the
day
a
servant
brought
an
oil
lamp
baibars
waved
the
lamp
away
then
called
the
servant
back
and
asked
for
kaviyeh
tilia
drank
the
sweet
strong
kaviyeh
of
el
kahira
with
baibars
and
devoured
a
tray
of
sticky
sweets
and
then
went
on
with
her
story
by
the
time
she
was
finished
the
moon
had
risen
above
the
courtyard
she
sat
back
and
looked
at
the
victorious
king
he
was
to
me
like
my
firstborn
son
baibars
took
a
dagger
from
his
sash
held
open
his
shimmering
silk
kaftan
a
costly
robe
of
honor
and
slashed
a
great
rent
in
it
tilia
wondered
what
to
say
how
could
she
comfort
him
him
how
can
anyone
offer
comfort
to
a
man
like
baibars
we
are
mamelukes
he
said
slaves
we
are
slaves
of
god
we
are
his
instruments
his
weapons
i
shaped
daoud
to
be
a
fine
weapon
against
the
enemies
of
the
faith
and
it
is
even
as
this
simon
de
gobignon
told
the
greek
woman
sophia
daoud
succeeded
abagha
khan
still
seeks
an
alliance
with
the
christians
as
his
father
hulagu
did
but
many
tartars
have
already
converted
to
islam
and
the
next
tartar
khan
of
persia
may
be
a
muslim
i
am
working
to
make
that
possibility
a
certainty
as
for
the
christians
my
informant
at
the
court
of
charles
a
certain
dwarf
named
erculio
tells
me
that
now
charles
desires
to
extend
his
empire
across
the
middle
sea
into
africa
king
louis
is
already
gathering
ships
and
men
for
a
crusade
but
charles
is
trying
to
divert
louis
crusade
to
tunisia
which
would
make
it
harmless
to
us
he
is
a
very
persuasive
man
and
i
think
he
will
succeed
truly
this
charles
is
god
gift
to
me
he
does
just
what
i
want
and
i
do
not
have
to
pay
him
tilia
heard
no
mirth
in
baibars
deep
laughter
and
so
baibars
said
daoud
has
won
for
us
the
time
we
needed
and
changed
the
fate
of
nations
and
he
will
be
avenged
i
do
not
think
he
would
feel
a
need
to
be
avenged
my
lord
he
would
be
happy
just
to
know
that
he
saved
his
people
from
destruction
baibars
nodded
true
but
i
too
am
a
sword
in
the
hands
of
god
and
if
it
pleases
god
to
wield
me
then
in
a
generation
there
will
not
be
a
crusader
left
anywhere
on
the
sacred
soil
of
that
will
be
daoud
vengeance
and
his
monument
hear
me
o
god
by
the
light
of
the
crescent
moon
hanging
over
the
multicolored
palace
tilia
watched
the
mameluke
sultan
raise
his
right
hand
to
heaven
tears
ran
down
his
jutting
cheeks
baibars
tears
she
saw
ran
as
freely
from
his
blind
eye
as
from
the
eye
that
could
see
about
the
author
robert
shea
is
of
the
famous
illuminatus
trilogy
dell
his
other
works
include
shike
and
all
things
are
lights
he
lives
in
glencoe
illinois
a
time
of
unconstrained
passion
incredible
magic
and
above
all
heroes
without
equal
in
the
centuries
to
come
destiny
will
not
wait
at
last
the
final
confrontation
between
east
and
west
saracen
and
crusader
is
about
to
take
place
the
awesome
magic
of
one
civilization
will
be
pitted
against
the
unslaked
thirst
for
conquest
of
its
rival
daoud
ibn
abdallah
the
spy
and
assassin
known
as
the
white
emir
from
the
palaces
of
cairo
will
have
his
duel
with
simon
de
gobignon
the
young
french
count
entrusted
with
the
guardianship
of
king
and
pope
and
sophia
the
beautiful
courtesan
richly
trained
in
the
arts
of
both
love
and
treachery
must
make
her
agonizing
choice
between
the
two
warriors
a
choice
whose
consequences
will
go
dangerously
beyond
the
hungers
of
the
heart
or
of
life
and
death
itself
