chapter
i
the
black
imp
a
slightly
decrepit
roadster
lurched
to
an
abrupt
halt
in
front
of
the
altman
residence
and
the
blond
driver
hailed
a
plump
girl
who
stood
on
the
front
porch
hello
susan
been
waiting
long
only
about
ten
minutes
penny
i
terribly
sorry
to
be
late
but
i
think
we
can
still
make
it
on
time
if
we
hurry
before
replying
susan
altman
slid
into
the
front
seat
beside
her
chum
penelope
nichols
then
she
said
frankly
if
we
miss
the
affair
altogether
i
sha
be
broken
hearted
going
solely
to
please
you
penny
laughed
as
she
steered
the
car
smoothly
through
traffic
i
know
you
are
sue
but
i
do
think
we
have
such
a
dull
time
as
you
imagine
it
is
every
day
that
one
has
an
opportunity
to
see
a
five
thousand
dollar
statue
unveiled
will
the
winner
of
the
huddleson
prize
get
that
much
money
susan
asked
in
awe
yes
and
they
say
the
competition
this
year
has
been
very
keen
the
showing
today
at
the
gage
galleries
is
a
private
one
the
general
public
wo
be
allowed
to
see
the
statues
for
a
week
or
so
then
how
do
we
get
in
penny
displayed
two
printed
cards
dad
she
announced
laconically
penny
father
christopher
nichols
a
noted
detective
was
well
known
in
belton
city
and
had
many
influential
friends
the
tickets
to
the
special
showing
of
the
prize
statuary
at
the
gage
galleries
had
been
presented
to
him
and
since
he
had
no
interest
in
the
affair
he
had
passed
them
on
to
his
daughter
the
winning
statue
is
to
be
unveiled
at
three
penny
declared
what
time
is
it
now
sue
then
we
never
make
it
penny
groaned
stepping
harder
on
the
gasoline
pedal
say
you
slow
down
or
i
get
out
and
walk
susan
protested
i
do
intend
to
risk
my
life
not
for
any
old
statue
penny
obediently
slackened
speed
although
she
drove
well
and
had
the
car
under
perfect
control
she
had
been
traveling
a
trifle
fast
that
better
susan
approved
at
this
speed
there
absolutely
no
danger
her
words
broke
off
abruptly
as
penny
slammed
on
the
foot
brake
so
hard
that
she
was
flung
forward
in
the
seat
from
a
side
street
a
long
gray
sedan
unexpectedly
had
entered
the
main
boulevard
the
driver
utterly
disregarding
the
stop
sign
penny
swerved
in
time
to
avoid
a
crash
but
the
fenders
of
the
two
cars
jarred
together
the
girls
sprang
out
to
see
how
much
damage
had
been
done
the
driver
of
the
gray
sedan
likewise
drew
up
to
the
curbing
and
alighted
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
black
moustache
immaculately
dressed
in
gray
tweeds
he
wore
a
gardenia
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
see
what
you
done
he
accused
angrily
before
either
penny
or
susan
could
speak
just
look
at
that
he
pointed
to
the
rear
fender
which
had
been
badly
dented
and
bent
penny
cast
an
appraising
glance
at
her
own
car
and
was
relieved
to
note
that
save
for
a
few
minor
scratches
it
had
not
been
damaged
it
too
bad
she
acknowledged
with
a
polite
show
of
sympathy
did
you
see
the
boulevard
stop
the
man
turned
upon
her
wrathfully
of
course
i
saw
it
and
i
made
the
required
stop
too
oh
no
you
did
susan
interposed
heatedly
you
just
barged
right
in
without
looking
in
either
direction
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
my
fender
the
man
demanded
testily
of
penny
ignoring
susan
entirely
nothing
the
fault
was
entirely
yours
you
lucky
the
accident
was
any
worse
we
see
about
this
the
driver
snapped
he
made
a
great
ado
of
copying
down
the
license
number
of
penny
car
if
you
determined
to
make
a
fuss
i
should
advise
you
to
see
my
father
his
name
is
christopher
nichols
nichols
the
detective
penny
could
not
restrain
a
smile
for
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
name
had
startled
the
belligerent
driver
yes
she
admitted
with
a
scowl
the
man
returned
paper
and
pencil
to
his
pocket
not
bothering
to
copy
down
the
entire
license
number
why
did
you
tell
me
that
before
he
muttered
climbing
back
into
his
car
you
did
ask
me
the
man
drove
away
while
penny
and
susan
after
making
a
careful
examination
of
the
roadster
continued
toward
the
gage
galleries
i
guess
it
was
lucky
i
had
slowed
down
before
we
met
that
fellow
penny
remarked
otherwise
i
could
have
stopped
in
time
to
avert
a
crash
do
you
think
he
try
to
cause
trouble
i
doubt
it
legally
he
has
any
grounds
for
complaint
he
probably
thought
he
could
bluff
me
into
paying
for
a
new
fender
but
when
he
discovered
i
had
a
detective
for
a
father
he
changed
his
mind
penny
chuckled
softly
and
drew
up
at
the
rear
entrance
of
the
gage
galleries
the
street
was
crowded
with
fine
limousines
but
after
searching
for
a
minute
or
two
the
girls
found
a
parking
place
we
late
penny
announced
let
go
in
the
back
way
it
will
save
time
they
entered
the
rear
door
hurrying
along
the
dark
corridor
intent
only
upon
finding
the
main
exhibition
room
they
did
not
observe
a
uniformed
attendant
who
was
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
bearing
a
canvas
covered
painting
the
girls
ran
into
him
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
penny
apologized
i
did
see
you
at
all
the
man
muttered
something
which
the
girls
did
not
catch
can
you
tell
us
the
way
to
the
exhibition
room
where
the
huddleson
prize
ceramics
are
being
displayed
susan
requested
the
attendant
did
not
answer
instead
he
moved
swiftly
on
down
the
corridor
with
his
burden
real
sociable
is
he
penny
commented
but
come
on
sue
find
the
place
without
his
help
they
followed
the
corridor
until
it
branched
off
in
several
directions
as
they
paused
uncertainly
another
attendant
approached
them
to
inquire
if
he
might
be
of
assistance
in
response
to
their
question
he
directed
them
to
a
room
on
the
upper
floor
the
girls
heard
a
hum
of
voices
as
they
entered
the
exhibition
hall
after
all
they
were
not
late
artists
sculptors
society
women
and
art
critics
were
moving
about
the
room
in
stately
groups
peering
curiously
at
the
various
statues
which
were
displayed
along
the
walls
penny
and
susan
felt
slightly
ill
at
ease
in
such
company
save
for
one
other
girl
who
appeared
to
be
about
their
own
age
they
were
the
only
young
people
present
after
showing
their
cards
of
admission
penny
and
susan
joined
the
milling
throng
they
peered
at
first
one
statue
and
then
another
but
were
not
really
enthusiastic
until
they
came
to
a
tiny
figure
which
seemed
to
be
attracting
more
than
its
share
of
attention
it
was
an
unusual
piece
a
small
dejected
imp
of
clay
who
sat
hunched
over
a
woodland
log
the
work
had
rhythm
and
grace
the
girls
studied
the
placard
beneath
the
figure
and
penny
read
aloud
the
black
imp
by
amy
coulter
sort
of
cute
is
it
susan
commented
from
the
conversation
which
flowed
about
them
they
quickly
gathered
that
the
black
imp
was
considered
by
artists
and
critics
to
be
one
of
the
most
promising
entries
in
the
contest
they
heard
several
distinguished
appearing
persons
say
that
they
expected
the
figure
to
win
first
prize
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
another
gentleman
disagreed
the
work
deserves
to
win
but
judges
have
strange
opinions
sometimes
especially
a
judge
such
as
hanley
cron
the
other
added
dryly
as
he
spoke
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
tall
thin
man
who
stood
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
until
that
moment
penny
and
susan
had
not
noticed
him
it
was
the
same
driver
who
had
caused
them
so
much
annoyance
gracious
penny
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
as
she
made
the
disconcerting
discovery
do
you
suppose
is
hanley
cron
the
contest
judge
that
what
those
two
men
just
said
susan
returned
let
get
away
from
here
before
he
sees
us
she
tugged
at
her
chum
hand
but
penny
would
not
budge
why
should
we
run
away
sue
the
accident
was
all
his
fault
anyway
i
curious
to
see
the
statue
he
select
as
the
prize
winner
i
hope
he
knows
more
about
art
than
he
does
of
driving
automobiles
hanley
cron
penny
repeated
thoughtfully
to
herself
i
heard
that
name
before
let
me
think
oh
now
i
remember
he
an
art
critic
for
the
city
i
do
believe
a
man
with
his
disposition
could
have
a
speck
of
judgment
susan
said
irritably
a
soft
musical
laugh
caused
them
both
to
turn
quickly
directly
behind
stood
the
same
girl
they
had
noticed
upon
first
entering
the
exhibition
hall
she
was
slender
and
dark
and
wore
her
shining
black
hair
in
a
becoming
coil
at
the
back
of
her
neck
i
could
help
hearing
what
you
said
about
cron
the
girl
declared
regarding
them
with
twinkling
eyes
and
i
do
hope
wrong
how
dreadful
it
would
be
if
he
should
award
the
five
thousand
dollar
prize
to
some
inferior
piece
of
work
such
as
this
silly
black
imp
for
instance
why
we
think
it
the
best
figure
here
penny
said
in
some
surprise
do
you
consider
amy
coulter
a
good
sculptress
only
moderately
so
the
girl
works
hard
and
is
pathetically
ambitious
but
it
takes
more
than
that
to
win
a
prize
you
seem
to
know
miss
coulter
well
penny
remarked
yes
indeed
i
might
call
myself
her
best
friend
are
you
an
artist
susan
questioned
before
the
other
could
respond
a
nicely
dressed
woman
paused
for
a
moment
to
admire
the
black
imp
you
are
to
be
congratulated
miss
coulter
she
said
addressing
the
girl
your
work
has
power
it
deserves
to
win
the
prize
the
woman
moved
on
and
penny
and
susan
found
themselves
staring
at
their
new
acquaintance
in
amazement
are
you
amy
coulter
penny
gasped
the
girl
smilingly
admitted
that
she
was
i
wanted
to
learn
what
you
really
thought
of
my
little
figure
she
declared
penny
and
susan
assured
her
again
that
they
liked
it
better
than
any
piece
they
had
seen
you
do
look
a
bit
like
i
imagined
a
famous
sculptress
would
susan
said
slightly
in
awe
perhaps
that
because
i
not
famous
you
will
be
after
the
prize
award
is
announced
penny
assured
her
everyone
is
saying
your
entry
is
the
best
i
do
think
the
black
imp
is
good
the
girl
admitted
slowly
of
course
i
was
only
joking
about
it
a
moment
ago
i
labored
over
it
for
months
and
it
my
best
work
i
hoping
almost
praying
that
win
the
prize
the
money
would
mean
everything
to
me
before
either
penny
or
susan
could
speak
an
elderly
woman
clapped
her
hands
sharply
together
to
attract
attention
immediately
the
room
became
quiet
if
you
will
kindly
find
seats
the
program
will
start
the
woman
announced
susan
and
penny
secured
chairs
in
the
second
row
when
they
looked
about
for
amy
coulter
they
noticed
that
she
was
sitting
at
the
rear
of
the
room
looking
tense
and
worried
miss
coulter
was
nice
was
she
susan
whispered
i
hope
her
entry
wins
so
do
i
you
can
tell
this
contest
means
a
lot
to
her
when
hanley
cron
was
introduced
to
the
audience
he
was
greeted
with
a
mild
round
of
applause
in
which
susan
and
penny
did
not
join
they
listened
closely
to
his
speech
however
and
were
forced
to
acknowledge
that
the
man
was
a
good
public
speaker
his
manners
before
a
crowd
could
not
be
criticized
for
he
was
both
pleasant
and
witty
he
praised
in
general
terms
all
of
the
many
fine
entries
in
the
contest
and
mentioned
perfunctorily
his
regret
that
each
contestant
could
not
be
awarded
the
coveted
prize
susan
grew
impatient
why
does
he
get
to
the
point
she
fretted
at
length
the
man
did
as
he
prepared
to
make
the
all
important
announcement
many
leaned
expectantly
forward
in
their
chairs
susan
smiled
confidently
back
at
amy
ladies
and
gentlemen
hanley
cron
intoned
i
take
great
pleasure
in
awarding
the
five
thousand
dollar
huddleson
prize
to
james
comberton
for
his
truly
remarkable
creation
night
a
little
buzz
of
excitement
and
obvious
disappointment
greeted
the
announcement
susan
and
penny
were
aghast
while
they
did
not
pretend
to
be
art
critics
the
statue
which
had
been
selected
seemed
to
them
far
inferior
to
the
black
imp
apparently
many
other
persons
shared
the
same
opinion
as
hanley
cron
a
trifle
defiantly
went
on
to
explain
the
various
points
of
merit
which
had
caused
him
to
select
the
prize
winning
statue
some
openly
shook
their
heads
in
disagreement
there
was
a
great
deal
of
whispering
poor
amy
penny
commented
regretfully
to
her
chum
she
was
so
hopeful
of
winning
and
she
should
have
too
susan
whispered
indignantly
i
told
you
hanley
cron
could
know
anything
about
judging
a
statue
he
just
a
noisy
talker
penny
smiled
knowing
that
her
chum
opinion
was
decidedly
biased
the
girls
were
tactful
enough
not
to
turn
and
stare
at
amy
but
when
it
was
possible
to
look
back
without
appearing
to
do
so
they
glanced
toward
the
seat
in
the
rear
row
which
the
young
sculptress
had
occupied
it
was
empty
i
guess
she
slipped
away
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
bad
news
penny
said
regretfully
the
announcement
must
have
been
a
bitter
disappointment
hanley
cron
ended
his
speech
a
few
minutes
later
and
a
silent
dissatisfied
crowd
arose
to
depart
penny
and
susan
hurriedly
started
toward
the
door
preferring
to
get
away
before
the
art
critic
recognized
them
they
did
not
reach
the
outside
corridor
for
a
uniformed
attendant
came
swiftly
into
the
room
closing
the
door
firmly
after
him
no
one
must
leave
this
room
he
commanded
the
startled
group
a
shocking
thing
has
just
occurred
someone
has
stolen
a
priceless
rembrandt
painting
from
the
adjoining
exhibition
hall
chapter
ii
a
mysterious
package
a
stunned
silence
greeted
the
attendant
announcement
then
the
room
hummed
with
excited
comment
not
in
many
years
had
anyone
attempted
to
steal
paintings
or
art
treasures
from
the
gage
galleries
for
the
institution
was
closely
guarded
hanley
cron
stepped
forward
to
ply
the
attendant
with
questions
regarding
the
theft
you
say
a
valuable
painting
has
disappeared
from
the
adjoining
room
yes
a
priceless
rembrandt
it
was
a
very
small
painting
one
which
could
be
smuggled
out
under
one
coat
and
when
was
this
loss
discovered
only
a
few
minutes
ago
sir
the
picture
and
the
frame
both
were
taken
the
museum
authorities
have
ordered
that
no
one
shall
leave
the
building
without
submitting
to
a
search
a
few
of
the
visitors
were
indignant
at
such
a
requirement
although
the
majority
readily
acknowledged
that
the
order
was
a
necessary
one
it
ridiculous
to
suspect
anyone
in
this
room
hanley
cron
began
and
then
stopped
he
looked
quickly
about
and
asked
abruptly
what
became
of
that
girl
who
was
sitting
in
the
back
row
i
think
she
left
directly
after
your
announcement
regarding
the
prize
penny
informed
when
no
one
spoke
for
the
first
time
the
art
critic
fastened
his
gaze
upon
the
two
girls
he
instantly
recognized
them
and
his
face
darkened
who
was
the
young
woman
the
attendant
questioned
penny
her
name
was
amy
coulter
i
believe
a
friend
of
yours
hanley
cron
demanded
with
an
unpleasant
inflection
to
his
voice
i
met
her
for
the
first
time
this
afternoon
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
girl
the
art
critic
questioned
the
crowd
in
general
although
a
number
of
persons
were
slightly
acquainted
with
the
young
sculptress
no
one
could
offer
any
information
regarding
her
character
susan
and
penny
grew
slightly
annoyed
at
hanley
cron
method
of
handling
the
situation
i
do
see
that
amy
coulter
has
any
connection
with
the
disappearance
of
the
painting
in
the
adjoining
room
penny
said
impatiently
she
came
here
today
because
of
her
entry
black
imp
was
being
considered
in
the
contest
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
left
because
the
award
was
bestowed
upon
another
statue
i
see
if
the
young
woman
is
still
in
the
building
the
guard
announced
he
went
away
returning
in
a
few
minutes
accompanied
by
an
official
of
the
museum
apparently
miss
coulter
has
left
the
galleries
the
latter
informed
in
a
worried
manner
can
anyone
here
furnish
us
with
the
address
i
believe
she
lives
in
a
rooming
house
somewhere
on
pearl
street
a
woman
in
the
crowd
spoke
up
i
hope
you
are
not
trying
to
connect
the
poor
girl
with
the
loss
of
the
painting
unfortunately
she
is
under
suspicion
the
official
replied
surely
the
girl
had
a
right
to
leave
the
building
when
she
chose
penny
exclaimed
it
happens
that
she
was
seen
by
a
guard
hurrying
away
from
the
galleries
with
a
flat
package
under
her
arm
she
left
by
a
back
stairs
and
was
not
observed
until
she
was
stepping
into
a
taxi
cab
the
attendant
tried
to
stop
her
but
was
too
late
and
was
the
package
this
girl
carried
the
approximate
size
of
the
stolen
painting
penny
asked
incredulously
the
guard
reports
that
it
was
he
was
almost
certain
it
was
a
painting
penny
and
susan
were
amazed
at
the
information
they
did
not
believe
that
amy
coulter
had
the
slightest
connection
with
the
disappearance
of
the
famous
picture
and
were
astonished
that
the
official
seemed
to
be
of
a
contrary
opinion
miss
coulter
could
have
taken
the
painting
penny
declared
impulsively
why
she
was
here
in
this
room
until
just
a
few
minutes
ago
did
you
notice
the
exact
time
at
which
she
left
hanley
cron
demanded
no
but
then
you
have
no
evidence
to
offer
it
looks
to
me
as
if
trying
to
protect
this
girl
i
only
want
to
see
justice
done
and
i
do
have
evidence
face
brightened
with
excitement
as
my
friend
and
i
were
coming
into
the
building
we
met
an
attendant
who
was
moving
a
small
painting
down
a
back
corridor
we
accidentally
bumped
into
him
and
he
became
very
confused
that
true
susan
added
quickly
we
both
noticed
that
the
man
acted
strangely
as
if
he
had
been
caught
doing
something
wrong
do
i
understand
that
you
are
suggesting
this
attendant
of
the
galleries
was
the
one
who
stole
the
painting
cron
demanded
with
a
superior
amused
smile
i
not
suggesting
anything
penny
returned
but
there
just
as
much
evidence
to
support
such
a
belief
as
there
is
that
amy
coulter
took
the
picture
can
you
describe
this
attendant
the
official
questioned
he
was
short
and
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
his
face
was
slightly
furrowed
and
he
wore
a
regulation
blue
uniform
susan
was
amazed
at
her
chum
accurate
description
of
the
attendant
for
she
could
not
have
recalled
any
of
his
features
however
penny
was
naturally
observant
as
her
father
had
trained
her
to
take
mental
note
of
persons
she
met
without
making
a
special
effort
to
do
so
your
description
seems
to
fit
one
of
our
new
employees
the
official
said
slowly
a
man
by
the
name
of
hoges
i
will
question
him
immediately
although
i
feel
confident
that
he
was
only
moving
a
picture
according
to
orders
after
a
very
perfunctory
examination
the
persons
who
had
been
detained
in
the
exhibition
room
were
permitted
to
leave
penny
and
susan
lingered
after
many
had
gone
hoping
to
be
of
assistance
in
identifying
the
attendant
who
was
under
suspicion
as
it
turned
out
they
had
a
long
wait
for
nothing
the
official
who
had
made
it
his
business
to
investigate
hoges
record
reported
that
the
attendant
was
not
to
be
located
he
had
left
the
galleries
for
the
day
is
that
rather
suspicious
penny
inquired
no
he
was
off
duty
at
three
but
we
saw
him
moving
the
picture
a
little
after
that
hour
susan
informed
he
may
have
been
working
a
few
minutes
overtime
hoges
is
considered
an
honest
employee
he
came
to
us
highly
recommended
i
am
told
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
move
several
pictures
this
afternoon
there
was
nothing
more
that
penny
or
susan
could
say
as
they
were
departing
the
police
arrived
upon
the
scene
to
make
an
investigation
of
the
theft
the
girls
saw
hanley
cron
and
the
official
talking
with
the
officers
and
they
heard
amy
coulter
name
mentioned
it
ridiculous
to
try
to
throw
the
blame
on
her
penny
declared
as
she
and
susan
went
to
their
parked
car
you
can
be
sure
that
painting
was
stolen
by
any
novice
amy
might
have
done
it
out
of
spite
susan
suggested
slowly
because
she
was
provoked
about
the
prize
it
does
sound
reasonable
to
me
sue
wait
until
the
police
get
busy
on
the
case
they
soon
prove
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
theft
penny
was
so
confident
of
such
an
outcome
that
she
did
not
feel
greatly
concerned
for
amy
although
she
had
talked
with
the
girl
only
a
few
minutes
she
had
taken
an
immediate
liking
to
her
both
she
and
susan
had
been
keenly
disappointed
at
hanley
cron
decision
to
award
the
five
thousand
dollar
prize
to
an
entry
other
than
the
black
imp
penny
dropped
susan
off
at
the
altman
residence
and
then
since
it
was
nearly
time
for
her
father
to
leave
his
office
stopped
at
the
detective
agency
to
take
him
home
christopher
nichols
was
a
tall
dignified
looking
man
with
appraising
gray
eyes
and
a
slight
tinge
of
gray
in
his
hair
he
had
solved
many
unusual
cases
and
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
was
one
of
the
shrewdest
detectives
in
the
state
nichols
took
his
own
accomplishments
in
a
way
but
he
liked
to
boast
of
his
attractive
daughter
ability
as
a
sleuth
he
was
very
proud
of
penny
and
teased
her
by
frequently
referring
to
the
mysteries
which
she
had
solved
in
the
first
volume
of
this
series
entitled
penny
nichols
finds
a
clue
the
girl
had
been
instrumental
in
capturing
a
daring
gang
of
auto
thieves
later
she
visited
a
queer
old
mansion
in
the
mountains
and
by
her
discovery
of
an
underground
tunnel
and
a
secret
staircase
cleared
up
the
mystery
of
the
lost
key
now
as
she
entered
her
father
office
it
did
not
occur
to
penny
that
she
had
embarked
upon
a
new
adventure
she
perched
herself
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
and
swiftly
gave
an
account
not
only
of
the
daring
theft
at
the
art
museum
but
of
her
unpleasant
meeting
with
hanley
cron
nichols
was
deeply
interested
in
the
details
of
the
theft
a
rembrandt
he
whistled
softly
that
painting
must
represent
quite
a
tidy
sum
of
money
how
much
penny
inquired
curiously
oh
i
not
venture
to
say
without
knowing
more
about
the
picture
offhand
i
guess
several
thousand
dollars
does
it
seem
silly
to
think
that
amy
coulter
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
theft
upon
the
face
of
it
yes
the
detective
replied
slowly
of
course
the
girl
may
have
been
an
agent
of
another
picture
thefts
usually
are
accomplished
by
several
crooks
working
together
the
girl
did
look
like
a
crook
dad
appearances
often
are
deceitful
penny
some
of
our
most
dangerous
criminals
would
pass
on
the
street
as
ordinary
citizens
however
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
girl
is
innocent
it
does
seem
a
little
strange
that
she
succeeded
in
carrying
a
package
out
of
the
building
without
being
stopped
by
a
guard
but
probably
she
will
be
cleared
of
suspicion
within
a
day
or
so
nichols
locked
his
desk
for
it
was
time
to
close
as
he
and
penny
were
preparing
to
leave
the
secretary
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
man
to
see
you
mr
nichols
a
man
did
you
say
the
detective
asked
with
a
twinkle
or
a
gentleman
a
man
the
secretary
repeated
firmly
and
an
unpleasant
appearing
one
at
that
did
you
tell
him
that
we
are
just
closing
the
office
i
did
nichols
but
he
insisted
that
his
business
was
very
urgent
he
refused
to
give
his
name
the
detective
frowned
and
then
asked
would
you
say
the
man
is
an
underworld
character
he
looks
it
shall
i
tell
him
you
can
not
see
him
this
afternoon
no
i
see
him
nichols
decided
you
may
send
him
in
penny
arose
to
leave
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
she
grumbled
duck
into
the
next
room
if
you
like
the
detective
said
if
the
conversation
gets
too
interesting
stuff
cotton
in
your
ears
penny
laughed
and
quickly
secreted
herself
in
the
private
study
which
adjoined
her
father
office
she
closed
the
door
between
the
rooms
but
was
careful
to
leave
a
generous
sized
crack
through
which
she
could
both
see
and
hear
scarcely
had
her
father
seated
himself
at
his
desk
when
the
visitor
entered
the
secretary
appraisal
of
the
man
had
not
prepared
penny
for
his
actual
appearance
he
was
a
stout
person
prosperous
looking
with
several
glittering
diamond
rings
on
his
stubby
fingers
his
clothes
were
cut
in
the
latest
style
his
shoes
were
brilliantly
shined
and
he
carried
a
sporty
cane
when
penny
surveyed
the
visitor
face
she
knew
why
her
secretary
had
catalogued
him
as
an
underworld
character
his
expression
was
hard
and
ruthless
his
smile
cold
and
sinister
good
afternoon
nichols
the
man
said
in
a
purring
voice
you
know
my
name
i
think
the
detective
eyes
narrowed
as
he
recognized
the
visitor
but
otherwise
his
expression
did
not
alter
he
said
evenly
yes
i
know
you
very
well
indeed
max
lynch
penny
crouching
at
the
door
felt
a
chill
of
excitement
pass
over
her
body
as
she
heard
the
name
max
lynch
was
a
notorious
crook
a
swindler
and
a
gambler
a
man
who
often
had
been
accused
of
crimes
but
seldom
convicted
of
them
well
what
your
game
this
time
max
the
detective
demanded
sharply
what
brought
you
here
chapter
iii
the
threat
max
lynch
smiled
disarmingly
as
he
seated
himself
in
a
chair
opposite
the
detective
you
have
an
abrupt
way
with
your
clients
nichols
you
no
client
of
mine
the
detective
retorted
you
never
have
been
and
you
never
will
be
the
gambler
continued
to
smile
blandly
refusing
to
take
offense
i
admit
i
never
hired
you
on
a
job
of
my
own
he
said
but
many
a
time
a
guy
has
said
to
me
is
the
best
private
dick
in
town
and
i
says
nichols
just
like
that
it
has
brought
you
some
nice
jobs
i
do
believe
i
ever
taken
any
case
through
your
influence
max
lynch
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
what
on
your
mind
the
gambler
moved
forward
in
his
chair
well
nichols
it
like
this
dutch
is
in
the
jug
for
pasting
a
dude
customer
of
mine
over
at
my
casino
last
night
dutch
is
one
of
my
bouncers
and
this
fellow
started
upsetting
the
faro
tables
after
he
had
lost
his
roll
dutch
bounced
him
out
so
hard
the
fellow
is
in
the
hospital
with
a
broken
jaw
and
you
want
me
to
send
the
man
some
flowers
the
detective
asked
sarcastically
max
lynch
ignored
the
thrust
it
this
way
he
explained
the
guy
turned
out
to
be
a
big
shot
of
the
town
a
broker
or
something
and
he
has
turned
so
much
heat
on
the
judge
the
poor
old
fossil
is
afraid
to
let
dutch
go
now
it
happens
this
broker
is
an
old
friend
and
client
of
yours
george
kirby
know
him
yes
i
know
him
very
well
all
right
you
go
and
see
george
and
soften
him
up
if
you
can
get
him
to
drop
his
charges
and
have
the
case
nolled
there
half
a
grand
in
it
for
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
raise
the
ante
the
gambler
offered
seven
hundred
and
fifty
there
not
enough
of
your
kind
of
money
in
this
town
to
employ
me
on
a
crooked
case
like
this
a
real
good
guy
ai
you
lynch
sneered
no
not
good
just
sanitary
the
gambler
face
flushed
with
anger
as
he
arose
and
edged
toward
the
door
chief
he
said
mockingly
and
do
worry
about
that
stuff
just
wait
till
our
gang
hears
about
this
he
slammed
the
door
after
him
and
penny
could
hear
his
heels
clicking
angrily
as
he
walked
rapidly
down
the
long
corridor
to
the
elevator
she
quickly
came
out
of
hiding
dad
that
was
max
lynch
the
one
they
call
max
was
it
she
inquired
anxiously
yes
the
detective
responded
soberly
i
guess
i
should
have
permitted
you
to
listen
to
the
conversation
i
glad
you
did
only
it
made
the
chills
run
down
my
spine
to
hear
that
man
talk
he
seemed
so
sinister
max
is
a
very
pleasant
character
penny
what
did
he
mean
by
that
last
remark
it
sounded
like
a
threat
i
imagine
it
was
a
threat
penny
why
do
you
turn
the
man
over
to
the
police
dad
for
attempted
bribery
i
wish
i
could
her
father
answered
max
is
a
slippery
eel
to
catch
the
police
have
been
trying
for
years
to
get
evidence
against
him
they
always
fail
but
he
deliberately
tried
to
bribe
you
dad
surely
that
ought
to
be
enough
to
land
him
in
jail
nichols
shook
his
head
as
he
thoughtfully
toyed
with
a
penknife
max
surrounds
himself
with
highly
paid
crooked
lawyers
and
hired
witnesses
he
is
clever
and
cagey
several
times
he
has
been
brought
to
trial
but
always
he
escapes
why
do
they
call
him
max
penny
questioned
curiously
he
been
known
by
that
name
ever
since
i
can
remember
perhaps
you
noticed
that
the
man
wore
a
number
of
diamonds
he
was
loaded
with
them
were
they
genuine
oh
yes
max
has
always
had
a
passion
for
jewels
especially
diamonds
i
suppose
he
came
by
them
dishonestly
possibly
although
he
could
easily
afford
to
buy
fine
jewels
with
the
profit
derived
from
his
casino
the
place
is
called
the
red
rose
is
it
penny
remarked
yes
it
a
disgrace
to
the
community
then
why
has
it
been
closed
nichols
smiled
tolerantly
at
his
daughter
the
red
rose
is
located
just
over
the
county
line
he
explained
it
happens
that
the
sheriff
has
a
very
charitable
attitude
toward
lynch
gambling
enterprises
then
there
nothing
to
be
done
not
very
much
i
fear
what
we
need
is
a
new
sheriff
promise
me
you
be
careful
penny
urged
anxiously
i
afraid
of
what
max
may
attempt
to
do
nichols
smiled
confidently
as
he
locked
his
desk
his
threat
was
an
idle
one
i
think
do
give
it
a
moment
thought
your
old
dad
can
take
care
of
himself
penny
sighed
as
she
followed
her
father
to
the
elevator
she
knew
that
she
should
dismiss
the
matter
from
her
mind
yet
that
was
exactly
what
she
could
not
do
ever
since
she
could
remember
nichols
had
lived
a
dangerous
life
he
had
trailed
and
captured
daring
criminals
and
during
his
lengthy
career
first
as
a
police
officer
and
later
as
a
private
detective
had
received
many
threats
several
times
he
had
escaped
violence
by
a
narrow
margin
usually
penny
did
not
worry
but
max
lynch
had
impressed
her
as
a
man
who
would
seek
retaliation
the
girl
was
so
preoccupied
as
they
drove
toward
the
nichols
home
that
the
detective
commented
upon
her
silence
forget
it
he
advised
kindly
i
know
how
to
deal
with
squad
penny
halted
the
car
on
the
driveway
and
the
detective
alighted
to
open
the
garage
doors
she
drove
in
and
snapped
off
the
ignition
together
she
and
her
father
walked
up
the
path
to
the
rear
entrance
of
the
house
the
nichols
residence
was
not
imposing
in
appearance
but
the
grounds
gave
it
a
air
a
grass
tennis
court
occupied
one
part
of
the
lot
while
the
opposite
side
was
devoted
to
gallup
flowers
since
the
death
of
penny
mother
the
kindly
woman
had
served
as
a
faithful
housekeeper
gallup
her
plump
arms
covered
with
flour
was
making
biscuits
when
penny
and
her
father
entered
the
neat
kitchen
i
slow
tonight
she
apologized
all
afternoon
agents
and
peddlers
have
been
coming
to
the
door
it
was
enough
to
drive
a
body
crazy
but
i
have
dinner
ready
in
about
fifteen
minutes
we
in
no
hurry
penny
assured
her
has
the
evening
paper
come
yet
yes
i
heard
the
boy
drop
it
in
the
mailbox
a
few
minutes
ago
usually
penny
had
scant
interest
in
the
newspaper
but
she
was
curious
to
learn
what
had
been
published
concerning
the
stolen
rembrandt
she
ran
to
the
mailbox
and
soon
had
the
sheet
spread
out
on
the
floor
as
she
had
expected
the
story
appeared
on
the
front
page
and
there
was
a
slightly
blurred
picture
of
the
painting
which
had
been
stolen
penny
studied
it
carefully
and
read
the
story
several
times
before
relinquishing
the
paper
to
her
father
well
has
the
thief
been
apprehended
nichols
asked
with
a
smile
no
the
story
just
says
the
police
are
working
on
the
case
and
expect
to
make
an
arrest
within
a
few
days
your
young
friend
name
is
mentioned
amy
coulter
no
but
i
do
like
that
statement
about
the
police
expecting
to
make
an
arrest
it
probably
just
some
reporter
idea
nichols
answered
carelessly
i
certainly
hope
so
of
course
it
possible
the
police
have
traced
the
real
culprit
by
this
time
i
hate
to
think
amy
coulter
is
under
suspicion
after
nichols
had
read
the
newspaper
penny
carefully
cut
out
the
story
which
concerned
the
theft
at
the
gage
galleries
including
the
reproduction
of
the
missing
painting
and
a
map
of
the
various
rooms
of
the
museum
do
you
intend
to
do
a
little
private
work
on
the
case
the
detective
inquired
slightly
amused
penny
laughed
and
shook
her
head
no
i
was
just
interested
because
i
happened
to
be
at
the
galleries
when
the
painting
disappeared
in
an
inside
section
of
the
paper
she
found
an
article
which
had
been
written
by
the
art
critic
hanley
cron
he
discussed
at
length
his
selection
of
the
prize
winning
statue
but
while
he
listed
a
number
of
figures
which
were
deserving
of
high
praise
nothing
was
said
regarding
the
black
imp
amy
coulter
entry
in
the
contest
after
dinner
i
going
to
get
another
paper
and
learn
what
other
critics
have
to
say
about
it
penny
announced
you
should
have
seen
the
prize
winning
piece
dad
it
was
terrible
i
fear
you
may
be
prejudiced
in
this
coulter
girl
favor
my
dear
i
not
others
said
the
same
thing
directly
after
the
dinner
dishes
were
wiped
penny
slipped
out
to
the
street
corner
to
purchase
two
other
evening
papers
she
turned
to
the
art
sections
and
was
gratified
to
discover
that
hanley
cron
selection
of
the
statue
winged
night
was
severely
criticized
by
various
authorities
amy
coulter
entry
was
highly
praised
and
one
writer
ventured
to
say
that
it
should
have
been
awarded
the
prize
penny
showed
the
papers
to
gallup
and
her
father
feeling
that
her
judgment
had
been
confirmed
however
she
was
deeply
troubled
by
the
similarity
of
the
news
stories
regarding
the
theft
of
the
painting
each
account
mentioned
that
the
police
expected
to
make
an
arrest
soon
and
one
said
that
officials
of
the
museum
were
of
the
opinion
the
painting
had
been
stolen
by
a
disgruntled
contestant
for
the
huddleson
prize
they
must
mean
amy
penny
declared
i
wonder
if
she
has
any
idea
she
is
under
suspicion
the
telephone
rang
it
was
a
call
from
police
headquarters
for
nichols
i
have
to
run
down
to
the
station
for
a
few
minutes
the
detective
announced
as
he
returned
to
the
living
room
after
answering
the
summons
the
chief
wants
to
talk
with
me
about
an
important
case
while
you
there
see
if
you
ca
get
a
little
information
about
the
stolen
painting
penny
urged
helping
her
father
into
his
coat
find
out
if
they
really
are
looking
for
amy
coulter
so
you
can
tip
her
off
i
suppose
nichols
inquired
dryly
i
had
thought
of
it
particularly
but
it
an
excellent
idea
penny
twinkled
nichols
was
gone
nearly
two
hours
but
as
he
had
expected
penny
was
waiting
up
for
him
when
he
entered
the
house
what
did
you
learn
she
demanded
instantly
is
amy
coulter
under
suspicion
oh
i
did
consider
it
a
good
policy
to
ask
questions
about
a
matter
which
was
none
of
my
concern
then
you
found
out
nothing
penny
cried
in
disappointment
and
been
sitting
up
waiting
for
you
too
i
did
say
what
i
learned
nichols
smiled
i
merely
mentioned
that
i
did
not
make
any
inquiries
you
did
learn
something
then
tell
me
nothing
very
encouraging
penny
the
police
are
after
this
girl
at
least
they
intend
to
apprehend
her
for
questioning
she
not
been
arrested
yet
no
it
seems
they
have
located
her
yet
i
heard
someone
at
the
gage
galleries
say
miss
coulter
lived
at
a
rooming
house
on
pearl
street
i
wonder
if
she
still
there
if
she
is
my
advice
to
you
is
to
keep
away
from
the
place
nichols
said
severely
do
get
mixed
up
in
the
affair
but
it
seems
so
unfair
for
the
police
to
annoy
an
innocent
person
dad
all
right
go
ahead
and
involve
yourself
if
you
must
the
detective
returned
if
you
land
in
jail
for
assisting
a
criminal
i
suppose
i
can
always
arrange
to
bail
you
out
they
both
knew
that
penny
would
never
feel
comfortable
in
her
mind
until
she
had
warned
amy
coulter
of
the
accusation
against
her
directly
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
penny
took
the
car
and
drove
to
pearl
street
she
did
not
have
amy
exact
address
but
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
locate
the
right
house
therefore
she
was
dismayed
to
discover
that
the
street
seemed
to
consist
of
uniform
looking
dwelling
places
nearly
all
with
room
for
rent
signs
in
the
front
windows
this
will
be
like
hunting
for
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
haystack
penny
thought
beginning
at
one
end
of
the
street
she
rang
the
doorbell
of
each
likely
looking
house
inquiring
if
anyone
by
the
name
of
amy
coulter
roomed
there
she
had
covered
nearly
half
the
street
and
was
growing
very
discouraged
when
she
halted
at
a
place
which
looked
cleaner
and
slightly
more
inviting
than
its
crowded
neighbors
in
response
to
penny
rap
a
woman
in
a
blue
wrapper
came
to
the
door
can
you
tell
me
if
a
girl
named
amy
coulter
lives
here
penny
asked
mechanically
for
she
had
asked
the
question
many
times
amy
coulter
the
woman
repeated
no
not
any
more
then
she
did
live
here
at
one
time
penny
inquired
eagerly
yes
until
last
night
she
did
give
me
any
notice
she
just
took
her
luggage
and
went
did
miss
coulter
leave
a
forwarding
address
no
she
did
i
ca
tell
you
anything
more
about
her
impolitely
the
woman
closed
the
door
in
penny
face
the
girl
walked
slowly
down
the
steps
to
the
street
she
was
disappointed
at
not
finding
amy
and
a
little
troubled
to
learn
that
the
youthful
sculptress
had
departed
from
the
rooming
house
without
leaving
an
address
her
disappearance
looked
almost
like
flight
the
muffled
roar
of
an
automobile
engine
caused
penny
to
gaze
toward
the
street
a
dark
blue
car
had
pulled
up
to
the
curbing
three
men
in
civilian
garb
climbed
out
and
after
briefly
surveying
the
rooming
house
walked
toward
it
men
from
police
headquarters
penny
appraised
instantly
i
can
spot
them
a
mile
away
i
wonder
if
they
on
the
trail
of
amy
coulter
too
chapter
iv
following
amy
trail
the
detectives
glanced
curiously
at
penny
as
they
came
up
the
steps
to
the
rooming
house
but
failed
to
notice
that
she
lingered
by
the
street
curbing
to
learn
what
had
brought
them
to
the
scene
they
rang
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
almost
instantly
by
the
landlady
you
may
as
well
go
away
she
began
irately
then
paused
in
confusion
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
it
was
someone
else
the
plain
clothes
men
flashed
their
badges
and
then
inquired
if
amy
coulter
resided
at
the
house
you
not
the
first
that
asked
for
her
the
woman
informed
someone
from
the
gage
galleries
has
been
telephoning
all
morning
until
it
enough
to
drive
a
body
wild
and
just
a
minute
ago
a
girl
came
to
bother
me
i
take
it
then
that
amy
coulter
is
not
here
one
of
the
detectives
interrupted
no
she
packed
up
her
luggage
and
cleared
out
last
night
without
leaving
an
address
what
has
she
done
now
we
not
certain
that
she
has
done
anything
but
we
wish
to
question
her
i
thought
something
was
wrong
when
she
cleared
out
so
fast
the
landlady
declared
she
paid
her
rent
all
right
but
she
was
a
queer
one
i
was
suspicious
of
her
from
the
first
the
detectives
talked
with
the
landlady
a
few
minutes
longer
before
returning
to
their
car
penny
had
heard
the
entire
conversation
the
visit
of
the
plain
clothes
men
to
the
rooming
house
made
it
clear
to
her
that
the
order
definitely
had
gone
out
for
amy
coulter
apprehension
as
a
suspect
in
the
gage
galleries
theft
it
seemed
likely
that
the
young
sculptress
was
aware
of
the
situation
for
otherwise
why
would
she
disappear
without
leaving
a
forwarding
address
anyway
there
nothing
i
can
do
penny
thought
i
may
as
well
give
up
the
search
and
go
shopping
since
pearl
street
was
not
far
from
the
business
section
of
belton
city
she
left
her
automobile
parked
at
the
curbing
and
walked
to
the
nearest
department
store
penny
had
a
long
list
of
items
to
purchase
for
gallup
had
mentioned
a
number
of
articles
which
were
needed
for
the
house
it
was
well
after
the
noon
hour
when
she
finished
the
task
she
dropped
in
at
the
store
tearoom
for
a
sandwich
and
cup
of
chocolate
then
gathered
up
her
packages
and
started
back
to
her
car
turning
the
first
corner
she
was
startled
to
notice
a
familiar
figure
across
the
street
a
girl
in
a
shabby
blue
serge
suit
was
staring
into
the
window
of
a
candy
shop
that
looks
like
amy
coulter
penny
thought
excitedly
she
hurried
across
the
street
to
accost
the
girl
upon
hearing
her
name
called
amy
turned
swiftly
and
her
face
lighted
with
pleasure
why
how
nice
to
meet
you
again
miss
nichols
for
an
instant
penny
felt
embarrassed
amy
looked
so
genuinely
glad
to
see
her
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
the
girl
could
know
of
the
accusation
against
her
it
would
be
awkward
to
bring
up
the
subject
i
was
hoping
i
might
see
you
penny
declared
after
a
brief
silence
in
fact
i
called
at
your
rooming
house
only
a
little
while
ago
the
landlady
told
me
you
had
moved
yes
i
did
like
the
place
very
well
and
it
was
too
expensive
for
me
where
are
you
staying
now
penny
questioned
and
then
as
the
other
girl
hesitated
for
an
answer
said
quickly
do
tell
me
unless
you
wish
of
course
i
want
you
to
know
miss
nichols
i
have
a
room
on
fulton
avenue
only
a
few
blocks
from
here
if
you
have
time
i
like
to
have
you
visit
me
i
am
on
my
way
home
now
i
like
to
accompany
you
penny
said
quickly
there
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
amy
coulter
looked
surprised
at
such
a
response
but
offered
no
comment
the
girls
devoted
their
conversation
to
casual
subjects
as
they
walked
toward
the
rooming
house
presently
they
paused
before
a
drab
looking
building
in
a
quiet
street
amy
offered
no
apology
as
she
led
penny
up
four
flights
of
stairs
to
a
tiny
room
on
the
top
floor
penny
noticed
that
amy
had
arranged
the
cheap
furniture
to
the
best
advantage
the
gay
curtains
at
the
window
bright
pillows
and
an
india
cloth
thrown
over
a
battered
old
table
showed
a
nice
appreciation
of
color
values
the
walls
were
attractive
with
fine
paintings
and
etchings
and
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
a
box
of
statues
and
ceramics
you
have
some
lovely
things
penny
remarked
admiringly
the
paintings
were
done
by
my
father
you
may
have
heard
his
name
eli
coulter
why
he
was
famous
as
an
artist
and
sculptor
penny
exclaimed
you
are
his
daughter
yes
but
few
persons
are
aware
of
it
a
name
is
forgotten
so
soon
unknowingly
amy
sighed
my
father
was
quite
noted
at
the
time
of
his
death
that
was
only
four
years
ago
it
seems
a
century
your
father
paintings
will
never
be
forgotten
penny
assured
her
earnestly
they
will
always
be
treasured
i
hope
so
father
really
sacrificed
himself
to
his
art
he
died
in
poverty
you
have
had
a
difficult
time
since
then
penny
asked
kindly
yes
but
i
have
no
complaint
i
shall
manage
to
get
along
and
i
derive
a
real
joy
from
my
sculptoring
your
father
taught
you
i
suppose
all
that
i
know
i
learned
from
him
but
i
can
never
equal
his
work
that
remains
to
be
seen
penny
smiled
you
are
only
starting
your
career
i
have
been
able
to
sell
any
of
my
work
i
am
getting
very
discouraged
i
had
hoped
to
win
the
five
thousand
dollar
huddleson
prize
but
i
failed
you
should
have
won
penny
declared
loyally
your
entry
was
by
far
the
best
the
judge
did
think
so
who
is
hanley
cron
anyhow
penny
scoffed
just
a
newspaper
art
critic
do
you
consider
him
an
authority
no
i
do
amy
returned
it
was
rather
odd
that
he
was
named
judge
of
such
an
important
contest
you
see
it
does
mean
a
thing
the
five
thousand
dollars
would
have
meant
something
amy
smiled
ruefully
i
could
use
it
to
pay
my
rent
and
buy
new
clothes
to
say
nothing
of
taking
lessons
in
art
i
desperate
for
money
ca
i
loan
you
a
little
penny
offered
oh
no
i
have
enough
to
keep
going
for
some
time
i
only
meant
that
i
could
use
that
prize
money
very
advantageously
by
the
way
have
you
read
the
morning
papers
penny
inquired
abruptly
no
i
was
so
busy
getting
moved
that
i
have
glanced
at
a
paper
for
days
i
suppose
the
critics
made
fun
of
my
poor
entry
upon
the
contrary
the
black
imp
was
highly
praised
however
i
was
referring
to
the
theft
of
the
painting
theft
amy
asked
blankly
what
painting
do
you
mean
then
you
have
heard
the
news
penny
said
watching
her
closely
i
have
heard
about
any
painting
being
stolen
surely
you
mean
from
the
gage
galleries
yes
a
rembrandt
was
taken
yesterday
afternoon
from
the
exhibition
room
the
police
believe
that
one
of
the
contestants
for
the
huddleson
prize
may
have
stolen
it
in
spite
the
theory
sounds
silly
to
me
but
how
was
the
picture
smuggled
from
the
museum
the
police
are
sure
but
they
think
a
girl
carried
it
out
as
a
package
she
was
seen
by
one
of
the
guards
entering
a
taxi
cab
amy
face
flamed
with
color
miss
nichols
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
i
am
under
suspicion
she
demanded
penny
nodded
yes
that
why
i
wanted
to
talk
with
you
the
police
are
looking
for
you
now
the
police
but
i
done
nothing
wrong
i
did
take
the
painting
how
can
anyone
accuse
me
of
such
a
thing
it
unjust
of
course
they
suspect
you
because
you
left
the
galleries
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
theft
of
the
painting
was
discovered
but
that
does
prove
i
took
the
picture
i
had
a
right
to
leave
no
one
would
have
thought
anything
of
it
amy
but
the
guard
reported
he
saw
you
board
a
taxi
cab
with
a
flat
package
under
your
arm
probably
he
was
mistaken
i
did
take
a
package
from
the
museum
the
girl
acknowledged
and
it
was
a
painting
however
it
was
my
own
one
which
i
had
exhibited
there
for
several
months
you
did
show
the
package
to
the
guard
who
is
stationed
by
the
door
no
when
i
left
the
building
he
was
not
at
his
usual
post
as
i
entered
the
taxi
cab
i
heard
someone
call
after
me
but
i
was
upset
and
i
did
want
to
go
back
so
i
just
pretended
i
did
hear
it
too
bad
you
did
return
and
show
the
picture
penny
commented
slowly
that
would
have
cleared
you
of
all
suspicion
as
it
is
you
in
an
awkward
position
do
you
think
the
police
will
believe
my
story
if
you
can
prove
it
yes
i
suppose
someone
at
the
gage
galleries
will
have
a
record
that
the
picture
you
took
was
your
own
amy
looked
frightened
i
afraid
not
she
admitted
you
see
the
painting
was
wrapped
up
for
me
to
carry
home
weeks
ago
i
did
want
to
bother
with
it
so
i
kept
it
in
my
locker
in
the
basement
then
yesterday
i
decided
to
take
it
with
me
no
one
saw
you
go
to
your
locker
not
to
my
knowledge
amy
crossed
the
room
and
lifted
out
a
small
picture
from
her
trunk
see
this
is
the
painting
a
vase
of
flowers
it
very
poor
work
certainly
about
a
million
miles
removed
from
a
genuine
rembrandt
in
silence
penny
studied
the
painting
she
really
was
not
thinking
of
it
at
all
however
she
noticed
absently
that
it
was
similar
in
size
to
the
dimensions
which
the
evening
papers
had
given
for
the
stolen
rembrandt
you
do
think
the
police
will
try
to
send
me
to
jail
amy
questioned
tensely
the
accusation
is
utterly
silly
penny
did
not
know
how
to
advise
the
girl
while
she
was
inclined
to
believe
amy
story
she
was
afraid
that
others
might
not
does
anyone
know
of
your
present
address
she
asked
amy
only
you
i
have
even
had
time
to
inform
the
postoffice
of
the
change
then
why
not
remain
in
hiding
for
a
few
days
until
this
trouble
blows
over
penny
proposed
after
a
moment
thought
i
should
suggest
it
only
i
feel
confident
the
real
thief
will
be
traced
soon
or
at
least
new
evidence
will
be
uncovered
i
should
like
to
appear
a
sneak
or
a
coward
if
i
were
sure
the
police
would
believe
me
i
be
glad
to
go
to
them
and
give
myself
up
that
just
the
point
amy
you
ca
tell
what
they
likely
to
do
and
the
story
is
almost
certain
to
come
out
in
the
papers
i
should
like
publicity
amy
declared
perhaps
you
right
about
hiding
i
stay
off
the
street
if
possible
penny
advised
arising
to
leave
and
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
take
all
your
meals
in
i
shall
amy
promised
thank
you
for
bringing
me
the
warning
i
appreciate
it
more
than
i
can
say
if
there
are
any
new
developments
i
keep
you
posted
penny
said
as
they
parted
at
the
door
the
truth
surely
will
come
out
within
a
few
days
she
walked
back
to
pearl
street
for
her
automobile
but
did
not
drive
home
instead
she
turned
toward
the
gage
galleries
it
seems
to
me
the
police
and
museum
authorities
have
overlooked
one
important
clue
she
reflected
i
ca
help
thinking
that
the
guard
susan
and
i
met
in
the
corridor
may
know
something
about
the
case
at
least
he
should
be
questioned
while
it
was
true
that
a
museum
official
had
vouched
for
the
honesty
of
the
employee
penny
could
not
forget
that
the
man
had
seemed
greatly
embarrassed
at
the
encounter
in
the
dark
hall
she
was
quite
aware
that
the
loss
of
the
valuable
painting
really
was
none
of
her
affair
nor
would
she
have
taken
such
a
personal
interest
in
the
case
had
it
not
been
for
her
acquaintance
with
amy
coulter
she
felt
that
if
the
girl
were
to
be
cleared
of
suspicion
someone
would
have
to
work
in
her
behalf
penny
entered
the
gage
galleries
by
the
main
front
door
and
spoke
to
a
guard
whom
she
knew
by
sight
have
you
heard
anything
new
regarding
the
missing
rembrandt
no
miss
the
man
responded
politely
the
theft
of
the
painting
was
a
severe
loss
to
the
museum
so
far
the
police
have
made
no
progress
in
tracing
the
crook
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
locate
a
man
by
the
name
of
hoges
who
is
employed
here
penny
next
inquired
you
will
not
find
him
at
the
galleries
miss
you
mean
he
off
duty
for
the
day
penny
asked
in
disappointment
the
guard
response
came
as
a
distinct
blow
no
miss
hoges
is
away
on
a
month
vacation
he
left
the
city
yesterday
to
travel
in
the
south
chapter
v
behind
the
panel
penny
was
disheartened
at
the
information
with
the
museum
attendant
out
of
the
city
she
could
not
hope
to
be
of
assistance
to
amy
coulter
the
situation
looked
very
dark
for
the
young
sculptress
unless
other
clues
regarding
the
identity
of
the
art
thief
were
discovered
soon
i
wonder
if
this
man
hoges
really
did
go
away
on
a
vacation
penny
mused
he
certainly
vanished
at
the
psychological
moment
giving
no
hint
of
what
was
in
her
mind
she
politely
thanked
the
guard
for
the
information
and
returned
home
after
leaving
her
packages
she
called
upon
susan
to
relate
the
adventures
of
the
day
i
think
you
were
wise
to
tell
amy
to
hide
susan
approved
we
know
her
story
is
true
but
it
does
sound
that
way
penny
was
not
certain
that
her
father
would
take
a
similar
viewpoint
she
intended
to
tell
him
about
amy
that
evening
and
ask
his
advice
regarding
the
situation
but
directly
after
dinner
nichols
isolated
himself
in
his
study
devoting
himself
to
a
new
case
upon
which
he
was
working
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
penny
did
manage
to
bring
up
the
subject
but
nichols
listened
inattentively
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
i
do
believe
you
heard
a
word
i
said
penny
complained
finally
what
was
that
oh
yes
i
did
you
were
saying
something
about
amy
coulter
never
mind
penny
sighed
i
can
tell
your
mind
is
a
million
miles
away
tracking
down
a
wicked
criminal
i
hope
the
villain
has
gone
that
far
nichols
chuckled
oh
by
the
way
you
might
tell
gallup
i
not
be
home
for
dinner
penny
regarded
her
father
severely
dad
have
you
forgotten
what
day
this
is
tuesday
the
twentieth
this
is
the
night
of
archibald
dillon
big
reception
the
detective
looked
disconcerted
i
forgot
all
about
it
he
admitted
how
i
hate
those
affairs
unless
i
there
on
a
salary
watching
for
gem
thieves
dillon
is
the
worst
social
climber
in
belton
city
just
the
same
we
accepted
this
invitation
and
we
have
to
go
penny
said
sternly
i
ca
make
it
i
have
important
work
to
do
but
dad
you
go
alone
penny
and
do
the
honors
for
the
family
tell
dillon
that
i
came
down
with
croup
most
unexpectedly
tell
her
anything
you
like
only
count
me
out
she
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
go
ca
you
possibly
make
it
nichols
frowned
in
annoyance
i
suppose
i
might
be
able
to
drop
around
late
in
the
evening
possibly
in
time
to
take
you
home
that
would
be
better
than
not
attending
at
all
all
right
we
leave
it
that
way
then
i
meet
you
about
eleven
tonight
at
mrs
dillon
the
detective
hastily
kissed
his
daughter
goodbye
and
hurried
away
to
the
office
penny
did
not
look
forward
to
the
coming
party
while
receptions
were
always
elaborate
usually
they
were
boring
susan
had
not
been
invited
and
she
doubted
that
many
young
people
would
attend
penny
sighed
as
she
reflected
that
she
might
have
spent
a
pleasant
evening
with
a
book
but
she
brightened
a
trifle
as
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
party
would
give
her
an
opportunity
to
wear
her
new
blue
evening
gown
and
silver
slippers
eight
found
her
en
route
to
the
dillon
residence
in
a
taxi
the
car
swung
into
a
curving
drive
and
halted
in
front
of
an
imposing
white
colonial
house
a
liveried
servant
opened
the
automobile
door
for
her
and
penny
joined
several
other
guests
who
were
entering
the
marble
hallway
miss
penelope
nichols
announced
a
servant
it
was
all
very
formal
and
made
penny
feel
slightly
ill
at
ease
she
paused
dutifully
to
greet
her
hostess
archibald
dillon
a
plump
woman
well
past
middle
age
was
gowned
in
an
elegant
beaded
dress
and
far
too
conspicuous
for
the
occasion
she
had
acquired
wealth
through
marriage
but
while
she
was
active
in
many
clubs
and
various
types
of
charity
work
she
had
never
been
able
to
achieve
her
social
ambitions
my
dear
did
your
father
come
with
you
she
inquired
giving
penny
hand
a
slight
pressure
no
dillon
he
was
detained
at
the
office
on
an
important
case
however
he
will
surely
drop
in
before
the
evening
is
over
penny
selected
a
chair
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
reception
room
and
surveyed
the
throng
she
saw
few
persons
she
actually
knew
although
many
she
recognized
from
having
seen
their
photographs
in
the
newspapers
a
long
line
of
chairs
along
the
north
wall
was
completely
unoccupied
apparently
dillon
had
expected
far
more
guests
than
had
arrived
a
listless
orchestra
played
for
dancing
but
only
a
few
couples
were
moving
about
the
floor
there
were
no
young
people
present
the
only
interesting
feature
of
the
party
was
the
expensive
costumes
of
the
guests
many
of
the
women
wore
elaborate
evening
gowns
of
velvet
and
bright
silk
adorning
themselves
with
glittering
diamonds
which
however
could
not
compete
with
a
string
of
matched
pearls
proudly
displayed
by
the
hostess
this
party
resembles
a
style
show
penny
thought
as
far
as
concerned
it
going
to
be
a
big
flop
dillon
presently
left
her
post
near
the
door
and
circulated
among
her
guests
trying
to
create
a
false
air
of
conviviality
noticing
that
penny
sat
alone
she
came
over
to
her
my
dear
are
you
dancing
i
shall
find
a
nice
partner
for
you
before
penny
could
protest
the
woman
hurried
away
returning
almost
immediately
accompanied
by
a
man
in
evening
dress
penny
was
dismayed
to
recognize
hanley
cron
upon
seeing
her
he
paused
and
a
look
of
keen
displeasure
crossed
his
face
unaware
that
she
was
creating
an
awkward
situation
dillon
gushingly
introduced
the
two
hanley
cron
bowed
coldly
we
met
before
penny
said
oh
then
you
old
friends
penny
politely
refrained
from
comment
but
hanley
cron
said
coldly
in
a
tone
which
made
his
meaning
very
clear
hardly
that
acquaintances
i
should
have
said
dillon
murmured
in
embarrassment
you
will
pardon
me
i
hope
hanley
cron
observed
aloofly
turning
his
back
upon
penny
he
walked
away
oh
my
dear
i
terribly
sorry
dillon
fluttered
i
find
you
another
partner
do
penny
pleaded
i
really
have
no
wish
to
dance
at
all
of
course
if
that
the
way
you
feel
it
is
dillon
i
really
am
enjoying
myself
just
watching
the
others
penny
statement
was
not
quite
true
for
she
had
derived
no
pleasure
from
the
party
and
the
rebuff
she
had
received
was
quite
enough
to
make
her
wish
that
she
had
remained
at
home
however
the
reply
served
to
satisfy
the
woman
and
she
mercifully
moved
on
to
talk
with
another
guest
hanley
cron
is
the
most
man
i
ever
met
penny
thought
indignantly
i
wish
dad
would
come
then
i
could
go
home
her
eyes
smoldered
wrathfully
as
she
watched
the
art
critic
talking
with
a
group
of
people
near
the
refreshment
table
she
knew
it
was
silly
to
allow
herself
to
become
annoyed
because
of
his
insulting
manner
yet
it
was
quite
impossible
to
dismiss
the
man
from
her
mind
not
wishing
to
even
see
him
again
that
evening
she
arose
and
explored
the
veranda
it
was
crowded
so
she
came
indoors
again
and
wandered
through
the
rooms
adjoining
the
reception
hall
the
library
was
entirely
deserted
penny
peered
with
interest
at
the
books
which
lined
the
wall
cases
most
of
them
did
not
appear
to
have
ever
been
used
selecting
one
at
random
she
curled
herself
comfortably
in
an
upholstered
chair
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
door
i
just
stay
in
here
for
an
hour
or
so
and
read
she
decided
no
one
will
miss
me
the
book
was
interesting
and
when
penny
glanced
at
the
little
clock
on
the
table
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
nearly
eleven
dad
should
be
coming
along
soon
she
told
herself
he
be
wondering
what
became
of
me
reluctantly
she
closed
the
book
before
she
could
leave
her
chair
to
put
it
away
she
heard
voices
just
outside
the
library
door
dillon
and
a
feminine
guest
entered
the
room
they
were
talking
in
low
tones
i
have
told
a
soul
except
you
dillon
declared
before
i
show
you
my
treasure
you
must
promise
never
to
reveal
my
secret
i
should
care
to
be
arrested
of
course
i
promise
the
other
agreed
neither
of
the
women
was
aware
of
penny
presence
in
the
library
for
she
was
concealed
behind
the
high
back
of
the
chair
the
girl
hesitated
to
reveal
herself
for
already
she
had
heard
enough
to
cause
dillon
embarrassment
she
decided
to
remain
where
she
was
and
keep
quiet
dillon
carefully
closed
the
library
door
and
to
penny
amazement
locked
it
i
do
want
to
risk
having
anyone
come
in
she
explained
to
her
companion
as
it
is
my
husband
is
quite
provoked
at
me
for
making
the
purchase
it
was
such
a
wonderful
bargain
i
could
resist
but
he
is
afraid
someone
will
learn
of
it
you
did
take
a
chance
in
buying
it
the
other
woman
remarked
oh
the
trouble
will
soon
blow
over
and
if
i
should
be
caught
i
can
always
plead
innocence
the
dealer
assured
me
i
could
sell
it
at
any
time
for
twice
what
i
paid
the
floor
creaked
beneath
dillon
weight
as
she
crossed
the
room
the
woman
halted
in
front
of
a
large
picture
which
hung
over
the
mantel
by
this
time
penny
was
overcome
with
curiosity
risking
detection
she
peeped
out
from
behind
her
chair
dillon
reached
up
and
jerked
a
long
silken
rope
which
was
suspended
from
the
picture
immediately
it
swung
aside
revealing
a
hidden
opening
in
the
wall
dillon
drew
back
a
blue
velvet
curtain
and
waited
expectantly
for
her
friend
praise
exposed
to
view
was
a
small
oil
painting
penny
recognized
it
as
the
stolen
rembrandt
chapter
vi
a
holdup
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
dear
dillon
questioned
eagerly
beautiful
the
guest
praised
stepping
back
a
pace
that
she
might
view
the
painting
to
better
advantage
how
fortunate
you
are
to
own
such
a
picture
i
always
craved
to
possess
a
genuine
masterpiece
dillon
declared
enthusiastically
it
gives
one
prestige
and
you
say
this
is
a
rembrandt
mrs
dillon
the
other
asked
it
must
have
cost
you
a
pretty
penny
it
did
but
at
that
i
consider
the
painting
a
great
bargain
the
dealer
assured
me
that
if
i
wished
to
dispose
of
it
at
any
time
he
would
promise
to
find
an
immediate
purchaser
undoubtedly
you
made
a
fine
deal
dillon
friend
acknowledged
from
whom
did
you
buy
the
picture
i
ca
tell
you
that
i
pledged
myself
not
to
reveal
his
identity
oh
i
see
but
you
are
quite
sure
you
can
depend
upon
the
word
yes
indeed
i
hope
you
do
think
i
allow
myself
to
be
taken
in
oh
no
certainly
not
only
i
heard
it
said
that
unscrupulous
dealers
sometimes
resort
to
tricks
i
pride
myself
upon
having
a
streak
of
yankee
shrewdness
dillon
said
and
i
do
know
art
when
i
saw
this
picture
i
recognized
it
instantly
as
one
i
had
seen
at
the
gage
galleries
of
course
the
dealer
did
claim
it
was
the
genuine
rembrandt
quite
the
contrary
then
are
you
afraid
not
in
the
least
dillon
interrupted
naturally
the
dealer
would
subject
himself
to
arrest
by
acknowledging
that
he
was
selling
stolen
property
the
painting
is
a
very
fine
one
the
other
woman
declared
but
i
ca
say
i
should
care
to
own
it
myself
you
never
be
able
to
display
it
openly
perhaps
not
but
i
can
show
it
privately
to
my
friends
and
i
derive
satisfaction
just
from
knowing
i
own
it
but
if
the
police
should
suspect
they
wo
unless
someone
reports
me
so
far
you
are
the
only
person
who
knows
that
i
have
the
painting
oh
you
may
trust
me
dillon
i
never
give
you
away
if
the
picture
should
ever
be
traced
to
me
i
can
always
claim
that
i
was
an
innocent
purchaser
dillon
chuckled
in
fact
i
know
that
this
is
the
same
picture
that
was
taken
from
the
gage
galleries
the
dealer
did
tell
me
that
it
was
an
original
you
very
shrewd
the
other
woman
praised
dillon
carefully
drew
the
velvet
curtain
over
the
painting
and
closed
the
panel
as
the
two
women
moved
toward
the
door
they
passed
close
to
penny
chair
the
girl
held
her
breath
fearing
detection
she
had
not
meant
to
be
an
eavesdropper
but
the
nature
of
dillon
conversation
had
made
it
impossible
to
reveal
her
presence
in
the
room
without
creating
a
difficult
scene
however
should
she
be
discovered
now
crouching
behind
the
back
of
the
chair
the
situation
would
prove
even
more
embarrassing
we
must
return
to
the
others
before
we
missed
dillon
said
unlocking
the
door
the
two
women
went
out
and
penny
heard
a
slight
metallic
click
which
at
the
moment
did
not
strike
her
as
having
any
significance
as
the
door
closed
she
quickly
arose
from
her
chair
penny
was
dismayed
at
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
believe
that
dillon
owned
the
painting
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
gage
galleries
from
the
conversation
she
felt
quite
sure
that
the
society
woman
had
purchased
the
picture
from
a
dishonest
dealer
who
undoubtedly
had
received
it
from
the
original
thief
yet
dillon
had
knowingly
purchased
stolen
property
and
so
in
effect
was
an
accessory
to
the
crime
she
must
be
crazy
to
involve
herself
in
a
deal
like
that
penny
thought
if
the
police
learn
she
has
the
painting
they
confiscate
it
and
arrest
her
penny
realized
that
she
had
it
within
her
power
to
expose
dillon
even
though
she
were
a
guest
in
the
society
woman
home
it
was
really
her
duty
to
reveal
her
findings
to
the
police
from
her
hiding
place
behind
the
chair
penny
had
not
been
able
to
secure
a
very
good
view
of
the
painting
she
was
eager
to
examine
it
at
close
range
did
she
dare
open
the
panel
she
decided
to
take
the
chance
jerking
at
the
long
silken
rope
as
she
had
seen
dillon
do
the
girl
was
gratified
to
observe
the
sham
picture
above
the
mantel
swing
slowly
back
to
reveal
the
hidden
panel
penny
quickly
drew
aside
the
velvet
curtain
which
protected
the
stolen
rembrandt
the
painting
was
one
of
the
lesser
known
works
of
the
famous
artist
a
picture
of
a
child
penny
snapped
on
the
electric
light
that
she
might
view
it
to
better
advantage
at
first
glance
the
painting
was
very
impressive
but
as
the
girl
studied
it
more
critically
she
was
assailed
with
doubt
the
picture
did
not
seem
to
have
the
character
or
strength
commonly
associated
with
great
works
of
art
the
draftmanship
seemed
mechanical
the
color
lacked
depth
i
wonder
if
it
really
is
a
genuine
rembrandt
penny
thought
the
longer
she
gazed
at
it
the
more
convinced
she
became
that
the
picture
was
merely
a
clever
imitation
she
wished
that
amy
coulter
were
there
to
offer
an
opinion
penny
did
not
trust
her
own
judgment
her
knowledge
of
art
was
so
slight
that
she
might
be
mistaken
in
considering
the
rembrandt
a
fraud
closing
the
panel
penny
sat
down
for
an
instant
to
think
she
knew
she
had
made
an
important
discovery
one
which
easily
could
cause
dillon
serious
trouble
should
she
report
her
findings
to
the
police
upon
the
other
hand
the
society
woman
was
an
important
personage
of
belton
city
with
many
influential
friends
and
should
she
be
falsely
arrested
the
trouble
would
descend
like
an
avalanche
upon
the
head
of
penny
nichols
i
have
to
move
cautiously
the
girl
reflected
it
no
crime
to
own
a
copy
of
a
stolen
painting
if
this
picture
is
a
fake
the
police
would
have
no
case
against
mrs
dillon
the
problem
was
too
deep
for
penny
she
decided
to
reveal
to
no
one
the
discovery
she
had
made
until
after
she
had
discussed
the
matter
with
her
father
quickly
she
arose
and
went
to
the
door
to
her
surprise
it
did
not
open
when
she
turned
the
knob
it
took
an
instant
for
the
truth
to
dawn
upon
her
the
door
was
locked
dillon
must
have
turned
the
key
when
she
went
out
penny
thought
recalling
that
she
had
heard
a
slight
metallic
click
now
i
am
in
it
she
considered
calling
for
help
but
immediately
abandoned
the
idea
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
how
she
had
been
locked
in
the
library
without
revealing
the
true
details
and
dillon
would
instantly
suspect
that
she
had
seen
the
hidden
painting
the
room
had
two
windows
looking
out
upon
the
front
lawn
directly
beneath
was
a
cultivated
bed
of
flowers
which
penny
decided
must
be
sacrificed
if
necessary
to
the
occasion
she
switched
out
the
electric
lights
and
raising
one
of
the
windows
peered
in
both
directions
to
see
that
the
coast
was
clear
quickly
she
climbed
over
the
sill
hung
by
her
fingers
tips
for
an
instant
then
dropped
lightly
down
to
the
ground
crushing
several
choice
plants
underfoot
before
she
could
turn
she
felt
her
arms
pinioned
behind
her
back
in
a
grasp
of
steel
not
so
fast
young
lady
said
a
gruff
voice
penny
whirled
around
to
face
the
man
who
had
captured
her
she
began
to
laugh
dad
penny
i
thought
i
had
caught
a
young
lady
burglar
what
are
you
trying
to
do
escape
from
the
library
so
i
observe
but
have
you
any
objection
to
using
a
door
in
polite
society
i
believe
that
the
accepted
method
of
leaving
a
house
the
library
door
was
locked
penny
explained
hastily
and
i
have
good
reason
for
wanting
to
get
away
without
being
seen
by
anyone
in
that
case
always
close
the
window
after
you
nichols
chuckled
here
i
boost
you
up
and
you
can
pull
it
down
after
penny
had
lowered
the
sash
they
hurriedly
moved
away
from
the
window
now
tell
me
all
about
it
the
detective
invited
did
you
lose
your
bag
of
loot
you
know
very
well
i
was
doing
anything
i
should
penny
countered
but
you
nearly
frightened
me
to
death
when
you
nabbed
me
i
just
happened
to
see
you
climbing
out
of
the
window
as
i
came
up
the
path
the
detective
smiled
i
thought
perhaps
someone
was
escaping
with
the
family
jewels
speaking
of
jewelry
there
plenty
of
it
around
tonight
the
ballroom
is
fairly
ablaze
with
it
never
mind
the
jewelry
nichols
said
what
were
you
doing
in
the
library
leading
her
father
to
a
secluded
stone
bench
in
the
garden
penny
related
all
that
she
had
seen
and
heard
i
wish
you
could
see
the
picture
she
ended
i
almost
certain
it
a
fake
if
i
can
smuggle
you
into
the
library
will
you
look
at
it
no
penny
i
will
not
you
seem
to
forget
that
we
guests
of
mrs
dillon
yes
but
if
she
has
the
stolen
rembrandt
in
her
possession
is
it
our
duty
to
notify
the
police
do
you
know
that
she
has
the
stolen
painting
no
in
fact
i
rather
suspect
she
been
cheated
by
a
dishonest
dealer
in
that
event
you
only
stir
up
a
hornet
nest
without
doing
a
particle
of
good
in
fact
exposing
dillon
might
give
the
real
thief
a
warning
to
lie
low
how
do
you
mean
dad
why
the
moment
dillon
is
arrested
the
dealer
from
whom
she
purchased
the
picture
will
disappear
then
there
will
be
no
way
to
trace
the
real
thief
you
assuming
that
the
dealer
and
the
thief
worked
together
even
though
the
painting
which
dillon
bought
may
have
been
a
fake
it
quite
possible
penny
some
day
when
the
time
is
more
opportune
i
explain
to
you
how
picture
thieves
work
their
racket
for
the
moment
i
wish
you
accept
my
opinion
that
this
case
is
packed
with
dynamite
my
advice
to
you
is
to
be
very
sure
of
what
you
doing
before
you
start
any
action
i
guess
you
right
penny
agreed
i
not
do
anything
rash
the
case
may
shake
down
in
a
few
days
nichols
went
on
in
the
meantime
dillon
is
going
to
dispose
of
her
picture
not
find
it
as
easy
to
sell
as
she
anticipates
the
detective
arose
from
the
bench
after
glancing
at
his
watch
we
have
to
go
inside
now
he
said
or
the
party
will
be
over
they
entered
the
house
and
after
wandering
about
for
a
few
minutes
encountered
dillon
she
greeted
the
detective
cordially
and
the
smile
she
bestowed
upon
penny
disclosed
that
she
had
not
even
noticed
the
girl
long
absence
from
the
ballroom
how
do
you
like
her
penny
whispered
to
her
father
as
they
sought
the
refreshment
table
the
detective
shrugged
she
serves
very
good
punch
nichols
knew
nearly
all
of
the
guests
either
personally
or
by
reputation
penny
noticed
that
as
he
appeared
to
talk
casually
with
one
person
after
another
actually
he
was
surveying
the
throng
somewhat
critically
you
were
right
about
the
jewelry
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
his
daughter
that
necklace
dillon
is
wearing
must
be
worth
at
least
a
cool
ten
thousand
dollars
i
should
think
she
be
afraid
of
losing
it
penny
commented
oh
it
probably
insured
for
all
it
worth
nichols
returned
casually
the
orchestra
had
struck
up
again
and
as
other
couples
went
out
on
the
floor
penny
tugged
at
her
father
sleeve
come
on
dad
let
dance
you
know
i
hate
it
penny
just
one
she
pleaded
i
had
no
fun
at
all
this
evening
oh
all
right
he
gave
in
but
remember
one
dance
is
the
limit
that
depends
upon
how
many
times
you
step
on
my
feet
penny
laughed
actually
christopher
nichols
was
a
far
better
dancer
than
he
imagined
himself
to
be
his
steps
were
introduced
in
a
mechanical
routine
which
sometimes
annoyed
penny
but
otherwise
he
made
an
excellent
partner
gliding
smoothly
over
the
floor
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
young
man
how
am
i
doing
he
mumbled
in
his
daughter
ear
as
he
whirled
her
deftly
about
to
avoid
striking
another
couple
not
bad
at
all
penny
responded
smiling
consider
yourself
engaged
for
the
next
dance
only
one
i
said
i
do
want
to
be
laid
up
with
rheumatism
tomorrow
rheumatism
penny
scoffed
she
had
spoken
the
word
in
an
ordinary
tone
but
it
sounded
as
if
she
had
shouted
it
for
the
music
ended
unexpectedly
in
the
middle
of
a
strain
trailing
off
into
discordant
tones
the
amazed
dancers
halted
looking
toward
the
orchestra
to
see
what
was
wrong
penny
felt
the
arm
which
her
father
held
about
her
waist
stiffen
a
scream
of
terror
rippled
over
the
room
two
men
with
white
handkerchiefs
pulled
over
their
faces
had
entered
the
ballroom
through
the
double
french
doors
opening
into
the
garden
they
trained
their
revolvers
upon
the
dancers
this
is
a
one
announced
grimly
put
up
your
hands
and
stand
against
the
north
wall
chapter
vii
an
invitation
to
lunch
penny
and
her
father
were
forced
to
line
up
with
the
other
guests
they
stood
against
the
north
wall
their
hands
held
above
their
head
members
of
the
orchestra
and
servants
were
compelled
to
obey
the
order
while
one
of
the
holdup
men
covered
the
crowd
with
his
revolver
the
other
moved
swiftly
from
person
to
person
collecting
jewelry
watches
and
money
penny
saw
dillon
pale
and
frightened
trying
to
drop
her
pearl
necklace
into
a
flower
pot
but
she
was
not
quick
enough
the
holdup
man
jerked
the
string
from
her
hand
oh
no
you
do
lady
he
snarled
he
admired
the
pearls
an
instant
before
dropping
them
into
a
small
cloth
bag
which
he
carried
penny
stood
next
in
line
she
wore
no
jewelry
save
an
inexpensive
brooch
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
the
thief
jerked
it
from
her
dress
oh
please
do
take
that
she
began
make
no
resistance
nichols
ordered
curtly
penny
relapsed
into
silence
she
was
a
trifle
puzzled
at
her
attitude
for
she
had
always
imagined
that
in
such
a
situation
he
would
be
the
first
to
fly
into
action
the
holdup
man
paused
in
front
of
the
detective
your
money
and
valuables
he
commanded
help
yourself
the
detective
invited
cheerfully
as
the
holdup
man
reached
into
an
inside
pocket
nichols
fist
shot
out
catching
him
squarely
under
the
jaw
the
startled
thief
staggered
back
and
dropped
his
bag
of
loot
before
he
could
recover
from
the
blow
the
detective
wrenched
the
revolver
from
his
grasp
look
out
penny
screamed
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
the
other
holdup
man
was
taking
careful
aim
at
the
detective
nichols
whirled
and
fired
the
shot
buried
itself
in
the
wall
but
it
was
close
enough
to
the
crook
to
warn
him
that
the
detective
was
no
amateur
at
handling
firearms
scram
he
yelled
warningly
to
his
companion
they
fled
into
the
garden
with
the
detective
in
close
pursuit
the
two
thieves
were
too
hard
pressed
to
give
any
thought
to
the
lost
bag
of
loot
several
shots
were
exchanged
but
the
men
succeeded
in
reaching
their
car
which
was
parked
in
the
driveway
the
engine
roared
as
they
sped
away
springing
into
his
own
automobile
nichols
took
up
the
pursuit
but
he
soon
abandoned
it
as
useless
returning
to
the
house
there
he
telephoned
the
police
offering
not
only
the
license
number
of
the
fleeing
automobile
but
a
detailed
description
of
the
men
the
radio
cruiser
ought
to
pick
them
up
in
a
few
minutes
he
told
penny
while
a
curious
crowd
gathered
about
he
took
a
knife
and
extracted
the
bullet
which
had
been
fired
into
the
wall
what
will
you
do
with
that
someone
questioned
keep
it
for
evidence
he
explained
and
this
revolver
as
well
although
now
that
i
used
it
all
fingermarks
probably
have
been
obliterated
the
women
were
clamoring
for
their
lost
jewelry
so
with
assistance
the
detective
distributed
the
articles
i
feel
just
like
santa
claus
taking
presents
out
of
my
pack
he
declared
jokingly
here
your
brooch
penny
did
you
think
you
were
going
to
lose
it
yes
i
did
dad
i
saw
red
when
that
man
tore
it
off
my
dress
so
did
i
you
certainly
did
show
it
you
advised
me
to
make
no
resistance
that
was
because
i
did
want
you
to
be
shot
then
you
turned
right
around
a
second
later
and
took
a
big
chance
yourself
you
might
have
been
killed
i
knew
what
i
was
about
the
detective
returned
quietly
dillon
came
up
to
nichols
gripping
his
hand
her
own
was
trembling
you
were
marvelous
simply
marvelous
she
said
tremulously
never
before
in
my
life
have
i
witnessed
such
a
display
of
courage
others
joined
in
the
praise
until
nichols
was
embarrassed
he
hurriedly
began
to
distribute
the
remainder
of
the
stolen
jewelry
your
necklace
he
said
to
dillon
presenting
it
to
her
thank
you
thank
you
the
woman
murmured
gratefully
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
for
saving
my
pearls
by
taking
better
care
of
them
in
the
future
he
responded
grimly
dillon
looked
slightly
offended
i
have
always
taken
excellent
care
of
my
pearls
nichols
she
replied
perhaps
your
idea
of
excellent
care
does
not
agree
with
mine
the
necklace
is
insured
no
it
is
dillon
admitted
reluctantly
my
husband
spoke
of
attending
to
it
several
times
but
never
did
you
took
a
great
risk
wearing
the
pearls
at
a
function
such
as
this
without
even
the
precaution
of
having
detectives
on
the
premises
to
watch
for
gem
thieves
you
were
here
dillon
smiled
i
shall
have
my
husband
send
you
a
check
in
the
morning
then
i
shall
be
compelled
to
return
it
the
detective
replied
may
i
ask
if
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
keeping
the
necklace
in
the
house
mrs
dillon
why
yes
but
i
assure
you
i
have
an
excellent
hiding
place
nichols
could
not
restrain
an
amused
smile
an
experienced
gem
thief
could
probably
find
it
in
ten
minutes
time
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
point
is
you
should
not
keep
the
necklace
in
the
house
at
all
unless
you
do
not
care
if
you
lose
it
of
course
i
care
dillon
retorted
that
string
cost
my
husband
fifteen
thousand
dollars
then
the
necklace
is
even
more
valuable
than
i
imagined
i
should
advise
you
to
take
it
to
the
bank
vault
in
the
morning
keep
it
there
until
you
have
it
fully
protected
by
insurance
i
do
it
dillon
promised
i
really
think
your
advice
is
worth
following
i
have
been
careless
with
the
pearls
in
a
few
minutes
the
orchestra
began
to
play
again
and
the
party
went
on
although
many
of
the
guests
were
still
too
nervous
and
excited
to
dance
they
sat
in
groups
discussing
the
christopher
nichols
became
the
center
of
one
admiring
circle
after
another
he
did
not
enjoy
the
attention
let
go
home
he
suggested
to
penny
i
had
enough
all
right
she
agreed
instantly
i
left
my
wraps
upstairs
get
them
she
crossed
the
ballroom
and
entered
a
hallway
as
she
paused
to
permit
a
couple
to
pass
she
noticed
that
hanley
cron
and
dillon
were
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
spiral
stairway
their
backs
toward
her
engaged
in
earnest
talk
she
could
not
help
hearing
a
snatch
of
their
conversation
dillon
why
do
you
take
lunch
with
me
tomorrow
at
my
studio
the
art
critic
invited
i
should
enjoy
it
cron
the
woman
replied
i
might
drop
in
after
i
take
my
necklace
to
the
bank
vault
i
see
you
are
determined
to
follow
christopher
nichols
advice
yes
do
you
think
i
should
i
believe
he
is
not
considered
a
very
reliable
detective
the
man
replied
however
in
this
instance
his
advice
might
be
worth
following
i
glad
you
think
so
cron
i
take
the
necklace
to
the
bank
in
the
morning
why
not
come
to
my
studio
before
going
to
the
bank
the
art
critic
proposed
then
i
could
serve
as
an
escort
with
such
a
valuable
package
in
your
possession
you
really
need
a
guard
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
offer
dillon
returned
flattered
i
will
meet
you
at
the
studio
at
one
and
after
luncheon
we
go
to
the
bank
together
penny
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
two
were
so
engrossed
in
their
conversation
that
they
were
unaware
they
were
blocking
the
path
i
beg
your
pardon
she
murmured
suggestively
oh
i
so
sorry
dillon
exclaimed
moving
hastily
aside
penny
gave
no
hint
either
by
look
or
action
that
she
had
overheard
the
conversation
but
inwardly
she
raged
at
hanley
cron
cutting
reference
to
her
father
ability
she
slowly
climbed
the
stairs
at
the
first
landing
she
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
and
noticed
that
the
art
critic
was
staring
after
her
his
expression
startled
her
how
that
man
does
hate
me
she
thought
and
all
on
account
of
a
ruined
fender
it
too
ridiculous
penny
had
observed
during
the
evening
that
dillon
and
hanley
cron
danced
frequently
together
apparently
the
society
woman
was
flattered
by
the
man
attention
although
penny
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
anyone
could
consider
him
attractive
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
art
critic
deliberately
was
trying
to
ingratiate
himself
with
dillon
she
considered
the
luncheon
invitation
which
cron
had
extended
to
his
hostess
while
it
might
have
no
significance
it
tended
to
confirm
her
belief
that
the
man
was
trying
to
gain
the
society
woman
favor
she
wondered
too
why
he
appeared
so
eager
to
accompany
dillon
to
the
bank
i
do
believe
it
because
he
wants
to
be
generally
helpful
she
told
herself
shrewdly
hanley
cron
simply
is
that
sort
of
person
as
she
stood
before
the
bedroom
mirror
penny
reflected
upon
what
cron
had
said
about
her
father
not
reliable
indeed
it
was
evident
that
the
man
deliberately
was
endeavoring
to
undermine
professional
reputation
unexpectedly
penny
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
in
the
mirror
and
laughed
because
she
looked
so
tense
and
worried
there
no
use
to
take
it
so
seriously
she
advised
herself
merely
learned
that
hanley
cron
may
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
enemy
chapter
viii
a
bold
move
a
few
minutes
later
as
she
was
driving
home
with
her
father
penny
repeated
to
him
the
conversation
which
she
had
overheard
between
hanley
cron
and
dillon
the
detective
smiled
at
the
slighting
reference
made
by
the
art
critic
but
looked
disturbed
when
he
learned
of
the
luncheon
engagement
before
she
gets
through
dillon
will
have
informed
everyone
that
she
is
taking
the
necklace
to
the
vault
tomorrow
he
said
impatiently
if
she
ends
up
by
losing
the
pearls
then
perhaps
she
know
better
next
time
nichols
stopped
at
the
police
station
for
a
few
minutes
to
leave
the
revolver
and
the
bullet
which
he
had
retrieved
from
the
ballroom
wall
when
he
returned
to
the
car
penny
questioned
him
regarding
the
holdup
men
have
they
been
captured
no
he
replied
in
disgust
they
got
away
it
was
long
after
midnight
when
they
reached
home
penny
would
have
liked
to
remain
up
awhile
to
discuss
the
exciting
events
of
the
evening
but
nichols
was
too
sleepy
to
be
in
a
talkative
mood
he
hurried
his
daughter
off
to
bed
i
think
i
visit
amy
coulter
sometime
penny
remarked
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
what
i
saw
last
night
convinced
me
that
she
could
have
no
part
in
the
theft
of
the
painting
the
picture
in
dillon
possession
does
prove
anything
nichols
replied
as
he
pushed
aside
his
coffee
cup
the
painting
may
be
a
fake
or
if
it
genuine
this
girl
may
have
been
one
of
a
gang
who
negotiated
the
deal
with
mrs
dillon
if
you
met
amy
you
understand
that
she
is
the
criminal
type
dad
and
just
what
is
the
criminal
type
give
me
a
definition
penny
threw
down
her
napkin
impatiently
oh
there
no
use
arguing
with
you
you
always
win
i
not
suggesting
that
your
friend
amy
is
a
crook
the
detective
smiled
i
merely
trying
to
teach
you
to
think
and
not
to
arrive
at
conclusions
through
impulse
or
emotion
after
the
morning
work
was
done
penny
telephoned
susan
altman
to
tell
her
about
the
dillon
party
susan
was
not
at
home
so
she
walked
to
amy
coulter
rooming
house
where
she
was
admitted
by
the
landlady
i
so
glad
you
came
amy
cried
joyfully
as
she
admitted
the
girl
i
took
your
advice
and
shut
myself
up
here
in
my
castle
but
it
been
dreadfully
lonesome
the
young
sculptress
had
been
working
on
a
small
statue
after
penny
had
admired
it
she
covered
the
figure
with
a
cloth
and
set
it
away
i
worried
about
my
black
imp
she
confessed
offering
penny
a
chair
this
morning
a
notice
appeared
in
the
paper
that
all
contestants
for
the
huddleson
prize
should
call
within
hours
at
the
gage
galleries
for
their
entries
i
afraid
to
go
for
fear
i
be
arrested
it
would
be
safe
penny
agreed
but
if
we
patient
for
a
few
days
longer
i
believe
the
mystery
may
begin
to
clear
up
in
fact
i
have
an
important
clue
already
she
then
told
amy
how
she
had
discovered
the
rembrandt
in
library
the
girl
was
overjoyed
to
learn
the
news
for
she
felt
that
the
recovery
of
the
painting
would
exonerate
her
however
her
face
clouded
as
penny
mentioned
that
the
picture
might
be
a
fake
if
i
were
certain
the
picture
was
stolen
from
the
museum
i
go
directly
to
the
police
penny
declared
but
until
i
am
sure
i
must
move
cautiously
i
wish
i
could
see
the
painting
i
feel
confident
i
could
tell
if
it
a
fake
i
wish
you
could
examine
it
penny
said
frowning
thoughtfully
unfortunately
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
arranged
unless
what
amy
demanded
quickly
dillon
would
never
permit
us
to
see
the
painting
if
she
could
prevent
it
we
have
to
get
into
the
house
without
her
knowing
it
how
could
we
ever
do
that
i
have
an
idea
but
there
would
be
a
certain
amount
of
risk
to
it
are
you
willing
to
take
a
chance
if
it
is
too
great
a
one
i
could
get
into
a
much
worse
situation
than
i
am
now
the
police
probably
will
arrest
me
upon
sight
anyway
this
is
the
plan
penny
explained
i
happen
to
know
that
dillon
will
be
away
from
the
house
at
one
today
for
lunching
with
hanley
cron
while
she
gone
we
look
at
the
picture
but
the
servants
will
be
there
amy
protested
i
think
i
can
arrange
it
so
they
wo
be
suspicious
do
you
want
to
try
it
amy
hesitated
only
an
instant
before
nodding
her
head
i
nothing
to
lose
and
a
great
deal
to
gain
she
said
penny
glanced
at
the
little
ivory
clock
on
the
dresser
it
was
nearly
noon
by
the
time
the
girls
reached
dillon
home
the
woman
should
be
away
it
will
be
wise
to
go
in
a
taxi
i
think
she
remarked
there
should
be
less
danger
of
anyone
recognizing
you
that
way
while
amy
changed
her
clothes
penny
went
downstairs
to
call
a
cab
it
came
twenty
minutes
later
and
the
two
drove
directly
to
residence
the
coast
should
be
clear
penny
remarked
as
they
alighted
at
the
door
it
a
quarter
to
one
but
dillon
surely
is
on
her
way
to
meet
cron
by
this
time
penny
boldly
rang
the
doorbell
presently
a
maid
answered
the
summons
smiling
graciously
the
girls
stepped
inside
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
to
do
so
tell
dillon
please
that
we
have
come
to
see
the
picture
penny
directed
confidently
dillon
is
in
miss
not
in
penny
exclaimed
and
turned
to
amy
in
pretended
chagrin
do
you
suppose
she
forgot
our
appointment
i
am
afraid
so
amy
murmured
dillon
went
away
in
a
great
hurry
the
maid
said
apologetically
she
did
mention
that
she
was
expecting
guests
she
failed
to
say
that
she
invited
us
here
to
view
the
painting
it
was
an
oversight
of
course
dillon
will
be
sorry
i
know
to
have
missed
you
your
names
it
will
be
some
time
before
we
can
come
back
i
fear
penny
interrupted
quickly
and
we
did
so
want
to
see
the
picture
i
suppose
you
could
show
it
to
us
i
am
afraid
not
i
do
even
know
what
picture
she
meant
oh
the
one
hanging
in
the
library
penny
informed
it
would
only
take
us
a
minute
to
look
at
it
why
i
guess
i
could
show
you
that
picture
forgetting
that
she
had
neglected
to
learn
the
names
of
the
callers
the
maid
led
them
to
the
library
the
girls
pretended
to
study
the
ugly
painting
which
hung
over
the
mantel
is
this
dillon
last
purchase
penny
inquired
it
the
only
picture
she
bought
recently
the
girls
shrewdly
concluded
that
the
maid
was
unaware
of
the
hidden
panel
and
were
at
a
loss
to
know
how
they
could
manage
to
view
the
rembrandt
i
could
study
a
beautiful
painting
for
hours
and
hours
amy
remarked
sinking
down
into
a
chair
opposite
the
mantel
so
could
i
penny
agreed
gazing
with
a
rapt
expression
at
the
hideous
picture
as
an
apparent
afterthought
she
turned
to
the
maid
who
stood
waiting
if
you
do
mind
we
just
sit
here
for
a
few
minutes
and
admire
it
certainly
miss
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
on
with
my
dusting
the
instant
the
maid
had
gone
from
the
library
penny
pulled
on
the
silken
rope
and
the
hidden
panel
was
revealed
she
jerked
aside
the
velvet
curtain
to
disclose
the
rembrandt
you
have
to
make
a
quick
examination
she
warned
that
maid
may
come
back
any
minute
amy
studied
the
painting
critically
when
she
did
not
speak
penny
impatiently
asked
for
her
opinion
i
believe
it
merely
a
copy
of
the
original
although
a
rather
clever
copy
rembrandt
was
very
skillful
in
his
method
of
handling
light
and
shade
in
this
picture
it
is
all
lost
then
i
was
right
penny
cried
triumphantly
my
opinion
may
not
be
right
penny
if
i
could
see
the
painting
in
a
better
light
with
an
anxious
glance
toward
the
library
door
penny
hastened
to
the
window
and
pulled
aside
the
heavy
draperies
a
beam
of
sunlight
fell
across
the
picture
yes
i
sure
it
a
fake
amy
decided
firmly
if
dillon
bought
this
for
the
original
rembrandt
she
was
cheated
well
she
deserved
to
be
she
should
have
tried
to
buy
stolen
property
let
me
look
on
the
underside
of
the
canvas
amy
suggested
sometimes
that
will
give
a
clue
as
to
the
age
of
a
painting
they
pulled
the
picture
out
from
the
wall
and
peered
behind
it
directly
in
the
center
of
the
canvas
was
a
strange
complicated
symbol
and
beneath
it
the
initials
both
had
been
inscribed
in
india
ink
what
that
for
penny
questioned
i
wonder
myself
amy
replied
then
it
is
customary
to
put
symbols
or
initials
on
the
back
of
a
painting
decidedly
not
the
girls
studied
the
marking
for
a
minute
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
i
ca
explain
the
symbol
amy
said
but
i
convinced
this
painting
is
a
fraud
penny
had
expected
such
a
verdict
as
it
confirmed
her
own
observations
but
for
her
friend
sake
she
was
sorry
that
the
painting
had
not
turned
out
to
be
the
original
rembrandt
had
they
actually
located
the
stolen
picture
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
lay
their
evidence
before
the
police
and
demand
that
dillon
be
forced
to
reveal
the
dealer
from
whom
she
purchased
the
property
everything
is
in
a
queer
muddle
now
penny
commented
thoughtfully
dillon
really
is
guilty
of
any
crime
at
all
for
she
buy
a
stolen
picture
we
ca
very
well
cause
her
arrest
dillon
should
complain
to
the
police
that
she
was
cheated
she
does
know
it
yet
penny
chuckled
when
she
finds
out
about
it
i
imagine
she
never
report
the
dealer
her
own
part
in
the
affair
would
be
too
humiliating
even
if
she
did
buy
stolen
property
that
was
her
intention
i
suppose
the
real
crooks
counted
upon
just
such
a
reaction
amy
said
when
they
sold
her
that
fake
painting
they
knew
they
were
safe
and
in
the
meantime
the
genuine
rembrandt
is
still
missing
penny
replied
musingly
i
have
a
suspicion
this
dishonest
dealer
who
sold
dillon
the
fake
picture
might
be
able
to
throw
a
little
light
upon
the
subject
but
how
will
we
ever
trace
him
unless
we
notify
the
police
i
am
afraid
that
would
be
a
sure
way
of
losing
his
trail
completely
penny
replied
dillon
arrest
would
be
the
signal
for
the
dishonest
dealer
to
get
out
of
town
that
probably
true
we
must
work
this
thing
out
cautiously
penny
declared
perhaps
if
we
went
to
dillon
and
talked
with
her
she
broke
off
as
they
heard
approaching
footsteps
in
the
hall
the
maid
amy
whispered
quick
penny
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
help
me
get
this
picture
back
into
place
before
she
comes
chapter
ix
the
robbery
the
girls
hastily
jerked
the
velvet
curtains
over
the
painting
and
closed
the
secret
panel
when
the
maid
entered
the
room
a
moment
later
they
were
gazing
with
rapt
interest
at
the
picture
which
served
to
disguise
the
rembrandt
we
must
be
going
penny
said
casually
for
the
benefit
of
the
servant
thank
you
for
permitting
us
to
see
the
canvas
now
that
she
and
amy
had
viewed
dillon
purchase
they
were
eager
to
leave
the
house
before
their
identity
was
discovered
i
tell
dillon
you
were
here
the
maid
said
escorting
the
girls
to
the
front
door
i
do
believe
you
mentioned
your
names
penny
and
amy
pretended
not
to
hear
they
went
out
the
door
before
the
servant
could
question
them
further
safe
on
the
street
the
girls
congratulated
themselves
upon
the
success
of
their
scheme
dillon
is
almost
certain
to
learn
what
we
did
amy
declared
uneasily
oh
she
hear
about
it
all
right
when
she
comes
home
penny
agreed
but
she
have
no
idea
who
called
the
maid
may
describe
us
possibly
but
you
safe
for
dillon
never
met
you
did
she
no
i
doubt
that
i
would
even
recognize
the
woman
if
i
met
her
on
the
street
i
seen
her
pictures
in
the
paper
though
even
if
dillon
suspects
that
i
came
to
her
house
she
wo
be
sure
i
saw
the
rembrandt
penny
commented
thoughtfully
she
has
no
suspicion
that
i
know
about
the
picture
what
will
you
do
now
that
you
know
it
a
fake
amy
questioned
i
have
decided
yet
i
like
to
find
out
where
dillon
bought
the
painting
that
might
give
us
a
clue
as
to
the
real
thief
but
before
i
question
her
i
think
perhaps
i
should
talk
the
matter
over
with
father
i
imagine
it
would
be
wise
amy
agreed
the
girls
were
passing
a
restaurant
and
penny
suddenly
remembered
that
neither
of
them
had
lunched
at
her
suggestion
they
entered
and
sat
down
at
a
table
for
two
near
the
front
window
hanley
cron
has
his
studio
in
that
building
across
the
street
amy
remarked
as
they
waited
for
the
waitress
to
serve
them
does
he
really
penny
asked
with
interest
do
you
know
cron
personally
oh
no
only
by
sight
and
the
less
i
see
of
him
from
now
on
the
better
i
shall
like
it
i
do
blame
you
amy
he
did
give
you
a
fair
deal
in
the
contest
at
all
i
dislike
the
man
myself
i
suppose
i
should
take
the
competition
so
seriously
i
admit
i
was
terribly
disappointed
it
was
just
the
money
although
goodness
knows
i
need
it
everyone
said
your
statue
should
have
won
oh
well
it
no
use
thinking
about
it
now
amy
smiled
i
even
dare
go
back
to
the
museum
to
get
the
black
imp
i
stop
in
for
it
if
you
wish
no
the
authorities
would
never
give
it
to
you
without
asking
a
lot
of
questions
i
just
wait
until
the
trouble
blows
over
it
will
be
soon
do
you
think
i
sure
of
it
amy
it
ridiculous
that
you
were
ever
charged
with
the
theft
the
girls
finished
their
luncheon
and
penny
succeeded
in
capturing
both
checks
she
was
very
glad
of
the
opportunity
for
she
suspected
that
her
friend
was
low
in
funds
they
emerged
from
the
restaurant
just
as
a
large
gray
automobile
pulled
up
to
the
curbing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
it
mrs
dillon
penny
exclaimed
pausing
to
stare
she
must
be
late
for
her
appointment
with
hanley
cron
the
woman
who
was
garbed
in
an
elaborate
afternoon
gown
alighted
from
the
car
she
held
a
beaded
bag
clutched
tightly
in
her
hand
dillon
spoke
for
a
moment
with
her
chauffeur
then
walked
toward
the
building
which
housed
hanley
cron
studio
penny
and
amy
noticed
a
man
in
ragged
clothing
and
with
cap
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
who
stood
lounging
in
the
doorway
he
had
been
watching
dillon
narrowly
suddenly
he
moved
forward
blocking
her
path
before
either
of
the
girls
were
aware
of
the
man
intention
he
snatched
the
woman
purse
and
darted
away
disappearing
into
the
nearest
alley
help
help
dillon
screamed
frantically
police
with
one
accord
penny
and
amy
ran
across
the
street
my
pearls
dillon
moaned
they
were
in
my
handbag
i
lost
a
fortune
penny
and
amy
reached
the
entrance
of
the
alley
in
time
to
see
the
thief
stealthily
climbing
a
fire
escape
quick
maybe
we
can
head
him
off
penny
cried
while
amy
ran
into
the
building
to
give
the
alarm
penny
daringly
ascended
the
fire
escape
she
saw
the
man
climb
hastily
through
an
open
window
on
the
upper
floor
and
disappear
if
amy
guards
the
lower
exits
we
capture
him
yet
penny
thought
without
stopping
to
consider
that
she
might
be
endangering
her
life
the
girl
stepped
through
the
open
window
the
room
in
which
she
found
herself
was
an
artist
studio
and
apparently
it
was
deserted
penny
glanced
quickly
about
there
was
no
sign
of
the
thief
she
darted
across
the
room
to
the
hall
door
to
her
astonishment
it
was
locked
from
the
inside
may
i
ask
what
you
are
doing
in
my
apartment
a
cold
masculine
voice
demanded
penny
whirled
around
to
face
hanley
cron
he
had
entered
the
studio
from
an
adjoining
kitchenette
oh
cron
did
you
see
him
in
here
she
gasped
did
i
see
whom
the
man
asked
with
provoking
calmness
a
thief
just
entered
your
studio
by
means
of
the
fire
escape
penny
informed
i
saw
him
come
in
here
hanley
cron
shook
his
head
and
a
slight
sneer
played
over
his
lips
no
one
has
been
in
my
studio
during
the
past
hour
except
yourself
but
i
positive
i
saw
him
he
entered
through
the
open
window
i
been
in
the
studio
all
the
time
as
you
see
the
outside
door
is
locked
the
man
could
have
escaped
penny
was
baffled
although
several
other
windows
opened
off
the
fire
escape
it
was
difficult
to
make
herself
believe
that
she
had
been
mistaken
however
a
careful
glance
about
the
room
assured
her
that
the
thief
was
not
hiding
there
will
you
leave
cron
asked
impatiently
your
story
about
a
thief
running
up
the
fire
escape
does
ring
true
you
probably
used
it
as
an
excuse
to
get
in
here
and
spy
you
soon
learn
that
it
the
truth
penny
exclaimed
with
rising
anger
just
wait
until
your
friend
dillon
arrives
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
her
pearls
were
stolen
and
it
was
partly
your
fault
too
cron
because
you
invited
her
to
call
at
your
studio
on
the
way
to
the
bank
you
must
have
known
she
ran
a
great
risk
in
carrying
that
necklace
unguarded
are
you
meaning
to
imply
i
not
hinting
anything
penny
returned
shortly
she
was
provoked
at
herself
for
wasting
to
much
time
in
idle
talk
it
had
given
the
thief
an
opportunity
to
escape
from
the
building
she
turned
to
go
but
just
then
her
attention
was
drawn
to
a
small
statue
upon
which
cron
evidently
had
been
working
his
smock
was
splattered
with
wet
clay
and
the
little
figure
which
rested
on
a
nearby
pedestal
had
not
yet
fully
dried
as
the
girl
gaze
wandered
to
the
statue
cron
became
slightly
confused
picking
up
a
dark
cloth
from
the
floor
he
covered
the
mass
of
clay
endeavoring
to
make
the
action
appear
casual
penny
was
not
to
be
deceived
she
instantly
divined
that
the
art
critic
did
not
wish
her
to
see
his
work
but
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
statue
she
had
seen
enough
to
know
that
hanley
cron
was
making
a
copy
of
the
black
imp
amy
coulter
entry
in
the
huddleson
prize
contest
chapter
x
hanley
cron
studio
penny
wondered
why
hanley
cron
should
wish
to
duplicate
the
black
imp
he
had
not
thought
highly
enough
of
it
even
to
award
amy
honorable
mention
in
the
huddleson
contest
she
had
no
time
to
consider
the
matter
for
her
chief
thought
was
to
capture
the
jewel
thief
before
he
escaped
from
the
building
already
she
feared
that
she
had
lost
him
why
do
you
keep
your
studio
door
locked
from
the
inside
she
demanded
turning
the
key
to
open
it
because
i
do
care
to
be
interrupted
while
i
am
working
cron
retorted
significantly
as
a
rule
visitors
do
have
the
effrontery
to
come
in
the
windows
penny
did
not
reply
to
the
gibe
she
opened
the
door
just
as
amy
came
running
up
the
corridor
holding
something
in
her
hand
she
stopped
short
when
she
saw
hanley
cron
amy
coulter
i
believe
he
said
sharply
wanted
by
the
police
i
done
nothing
wrong
the
girl
retorted
you
are
under
suspicion
for
the
theft
of
a
valuable
painting
from
the
gage
galleries
i
do
know
anything
about
the
picture
the
charge
is
silly
penny
added
you
seem
to
have
an
unlucky
faculty
of
being
present
whenever
valuables
are
stolen
cron
commented
coldly
is
that
dillon
bag
you
have
in
your
hand
yes
it
is
i
picked
it
up
by
the
elevator
it
was
lying
on
the
floor
the
thief
must
have
dropped
it
penny
declared
are
the
pearls
gone
i
have
even
looked
yet
amy
admitted
she
offered
the
beaded
bag
to
penny
who
promptly
turned
it
inside
out
save
for
a
compact
and
a
handkerchief
the
purse
was
empty
the
pearls
are
missing
all
right
cron
commented
looking
at
amy
do
you
dare
suggest
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
the
girl
cried
furiously
dillon
will
tell
you
that
penny
and
i
were
only
trying
to
help
i
do
know
anything
about
the
pearls
cron
replied
cuttingly
but
i
intend
to
turn
you
over
to
the
police
for
questioning
in
regard
to
the
stolen
painting
penny
turned
blazing
eyes
upon
the
art
critic
before
you
do
that
cron
you
might
explain
to
miss
coulter
why
you
are
copying
her
statue
darting
across
the
room
she
snatched
off
the
cloth
which
covered
the
sculptor
work
why
it
my
black
imp
amy
cried
in
surprise
you
reproduced
it
in
every
detail
hanley
cron
was
taken
aback
at
the
unexpected
exposure
but
he
quickly
regained
his
usual
nonchalance
i
rather
liked
the
figure
he
said
inadequately
that
was
why
i
copied
it
i
had
no
other
reason
you
did
like
the
black
imp
well
enough
to
award
it
a
prize
amy
cried
indignantly
you
have
a
very
good
reason
for
reproducing
the
statue
perhaps
you
intend
to
put
it
to
commercial
use
you
flatter
yourself
miss
coulter
the
statue
has
no
value
commercially
or
otherwise
you
have
no
right
to
copy
it
amy
insisted
with
increasing
anger
the
black
imp
is
solely
my
work
before
either
hanley
cron
or
penny
guessed
the
girl
intention
she
darted
across
the
room
and
snatched
the
little
figure
from
the
pedestal
what
are
you
doing
the
sculptor
demanded
harshly
i
going
to
take
the
black
imp
with
me
you
no
right
to
it
drop
that
furiously
cron
caught
the
girl
by
the
wrist
giving
it
a
cruel
wrench
amy
would
not
relinquish
the
mass
of
wet
clay
and
penny
hastened
to
assist
her
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
the
door
opened
and
a
policeman
looked
in
what
going
on
here
hanley
cron
hand
fell
from
amy
arm
the
girls
expected
him
to
make
a
direct
charge
against
them
but
he
seemed
confused
by
the
appearance
of
the
policeman
we
not
having
any
trouble
officer
he
muttered
just
a
little
friendly
argument
about
some
of
my
work
friendly
eh
the
policeman
questioned
he
gazed
inquiringly
at
penny
and
amy
it
was
really
nothing
the
latter
said
hurriedly
we
merely
disagreed
about
a
statue
the
girls
edged
toward
the
door
amy
still
clutching
the
black
imp
in
her
hands
they
both
confidently
expected
that
cron
would
bring
up
the
matter
of
the
stolen
painting
but
for
some
reason
which
they
could
not
fathom
he
stood
mute
the
policeman
however
blocked
the
exit
just
a
minute
he
said
what
this
bag
doing
here
he
picked
up
the
beaded
purse
which
had
been
dropped
on
the
table
penny
explained
where
amy
had
found
it
and
told
of
her
own
attempt
to
capture
the
jewel
thief
the
man
did
come
into
my
studio
cron
interposed
these
girls
are
so
excited
they
do
know
what
they
saw
the
thief
came
up
the
fire
escape
penny
insisted
i
admit
i
may
have
been
mistaken
as
to
the
window
he
entered
you
were
cron
said
shortly
i
guess
it
does
matter
greatly
now
penny
returned
by
this
time
the
thief
is
probably
blocks
away
it
was
dillon
who
had
called
the
policeman
she
had
noticed
him
at
the
corner
and
had
screamed
for
help
he
had
mounted
the
stairs
so
swiftly
that
she
had
been
unable
to
keep
pace
with
him
now
she
hurried
up
breathless
from
exertion
the
corridor
was
rapidly
filling
with
excited
occupants
of
the
building
who
had
learned
of
the
theft
oh
thank
goodness
you
recovered
my
bag
dillon
cried
joyfully
as
she
entered
the
studio
room
your
pearls
are
gone
the
policeman
told
her
handing
over
the
purse
the
thief
dropped
the
bag
in
the
hallway
after
he
had
rifled
it
dillon
sank
weakly
down
in
the
nearest
chair
her
face
was
white
and
penny
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
her
can
you
describe
the
thief
the
officer
questioned
oh
i
afraid
not
dillon
murmured
i
really
did
notice
him
at
all
until
he
came
up
to
me
he
asked
me
for
fifty
cents
when
i
refused
he
snatched
my
bag
it
was
a
planned
robbery
i
think
penny
interposed
i
noticed
that
the
man
was
waiting
when
dillon
drove
up
he
seemed
to
be
watching
for
her
car
the
policeman
directed
his
questions
toward
penny
who
answered
them
to
the
best
of
her
ability
however
she
was
unable
to
furnish
a
very
good
description
of
the
thief
officer
you
must
find
that
man
dillon
said
urgently
pay
a
liberal
reward
for
the
return
of
my
jewels
i
must
have
them
back
they
represent
a
fortune
i
do
the
best
i
can
madam
the
pearls
will
be
recovered
dillon
hanley
cron
said
soothingly
our
police
force
is
very
efficient
i
should
have
carried
the
pearls
in
my
purse
dillon
moaned
christopher
nichols
warned
me
i
should
have
heeded
his
words
where
were
you
when
the
bag
was
snatched
the
officer
questioned
i
had
just
left
my
car
i
was
coming
here
to
meet
cron
we
were
taking
luncheon
together
had
you
told
anyone
that
you
were
carrying
the
pearls
in
the
purse
only
cron
of
course
christopher
nichols
was
aware
of
my
intention
i
knew
you
were
taking
the
jewels
to
the
bank
vault
penny
informed
i
overheard
you
talking
at
the
ball
and
i
believe
others
must
have
listened
to
the
conversation
too
no
guest
of
mine
could
be
guilty
of
the
theft
dillon
replied
in
a
shocked
voice
the
man
who
snatched
the
bag
was
a
stranger
he
may
have
been
employed
by
another
penny
suggested
amy
was
decidedly
uneasy
in
the
presence
of
hanley
cron
and
the
policeman
fearing
that
at
any
moment
some
reference
might
be
made
to
the
stolen
painting
she
could
not
understand
why
the
art
critic
remained
silent
since
he
had
threatened
to
expose
her
hearing
the
whining
whistle
of
a
squad
car
arriving
from
police
headquarters
the
girls
quietly
slipped
away
cron
made
no
move
to
detain
them
even
though
amy
retained
possession
of
the
black
imp
why
do
you
suppose
hanley
cron
did
try
to
make
trouble
penny
asked
as
they
walked
swiftly
along
the
street
toward
amy
rooming
house
i
felt
certain
he
would
so
did
i
guess
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
copy
the
black
imp
he
was
probably
afraid
he
might
get
himself
into
trouble
penny
chuckled
either
that
or
he
did
want
to
make
a
scene
in
front
of
mrs
dillon
it
queer
about
the
statue
amy
said
musingly
i
ca
understand
what
he
intended
to
do
with
it
she
took
the
black
imp
from
her
pocket
and
examined
it
critically
the
damp
clay
was
slightly
misshapen
from
rough
handling
they
sat
down
on
a
park
bench
while
amy
deftly
moulded
it
back
into
its
original
form
it
should
make
a
fairly
nice
figure
when
it
dries
she
remarked
why
do
you
try
to
sell
the
black
imp
to
some
commercial
firm
penny
asked
abruptly
it
seems
to
me
it
has
possibilities
it
such
a
cute
little
figure
perhaps
i
will
try
later
on
amy
agreed
but
until
my
name
is
cleared
i
have
much
chance
to
do
anything
that
true
penny
acknowledged
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
copy
of
the
statue
oh
i
do
know
would
you
like
it
would
i
rather
but
do
you
want
it
yourself
no
i
have
the
original
if
ever
i
muster
the
courage
to
go
to
the
museum
and
claim
it
i
love
to
have
the
reproduction
penny
declared
enthusiastically
only
i
wish
you
had
made
it
instead
of
hanley
cron
i
make
you
a
nicer
piece
later
on
amy
promised
as
she
wrapped
up
the
figure
in
her
handkerchief
and
gave
it
to
penny
presently
after
discussing
at
some
length
the
exciting
events
of
the
afternoon
they
arose
and
walked
on
down
the
street
they
were
nearing
the
downtown
business
section
when
penny
halted
and
pretended
to
gaze
into
the
plate
glass
window
of
a
large
department
store
amy
i
think
we
being
followed
she
announced
in
a
low
tone
do
look
around
what
makes
you
think
so
amy
inquired
skeptically
ever
since
we
left
the
park
a
man
has
been
trailing
us
are
you
sure
every
time
we
stop
he
does
too
i
can
see
his
reflection
now
in
the
plate
glass
he
pretending
to
be
looking
into
that
jewelry
store
window
but
he
really
watching
us
you
mean
the
man
in
the
gray
topcoat
yes
maybe
he
a
man
who
is
after
me
amy
said
uneasily
we
can
soon
find
out
come
on
catching
amy
arm
penny
steered
her
into
the
department
store
they
sauntered
leisurely
through
the
aisles
frequently
pausing
to
examine
merchandise
unobtrusively
they
kept
watch
of
the
main
entrance
here
he
comes
just
as
i
knew
he
would
penny
exclaimed
in
an
undertone
as
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
entering
the
store
we
must
shake
him
quickly
now
they
walked
swiftly
down
the
aisle
and
took
a
crowded
elevator
to
the
top
floor
now
we
walk
down
three
flights
of
stairs
penny
commanded
already
they
had
lost
sight
of
the
man
but
to
make
certain
that
he
would
not
catch
them
again
they
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
building
and
took
a
elevator
to
the
main
floor
mingling
with
the
crowd
they
emerged
upon
the
street
we
certainly
gave
him
the
slip
amy
laughed
my
father
taught
me
that
trick
even
a
trained
detective
finds
it
difficult
to
follow
a
person
who
is
aware
he
is
being
shadowed
i
guess
i
say
goodbye
to
you
here
amy
said
regretfully
i
hope
i
see
you
again
soon
yes
indeed
i
intend
to
talk
with
dillon
about
that
painting
she
bought
i
let
you
know
what
she
says
the
girls
parted
company
but
penny
did
not
leave
the
scene
instead
she
walked
across
the
street
establishing
herself
in
a
doorway
where
she
could
keep
watch
of
the
department
store
entrance
two
can
play
at
this
game
of
shadowing
she
chuckled
it
was
nearly
twenty
minutes
before
the
man
who
had
been
following
penny
and
amy
emerged
from
the
store
she
noted
him
instantly
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
dressed
entirely
in
gray
i
do
believe
i
ever
seen
him
before
penny
thought
when
the
man
moved
off
down
the
street
she
crossed
the
street
and
trailed
him
he
walked
swiftly
and
did
not
once
glance
backward
apparently
having
no
suspicion
that
he
was
being
followed
once
the
man
paused
to
glance
into
the
window
of
a
pawnshop
he
turned
down
east
franklyn
street
which
led
through
a
dirty
district
to
the
river
presently
penny
saw
him
enter
a
dilapidated
brick
building
in
the
doorway
he
met
another
man
evidently
the
janitor
who
caught
him
roughly
by
the
arm
as
he
endeavored
to
pass
just
a
minute
you
he
said
i
been
trying
to
find
you
for
a
week
how
about
that
rent
you
owe
try
and
get
it
i
get
it
all
right
the
janitor
returned
threateningly
if
i
do
i
may
make
it
my
business
to
find
out
why
you
rented
the
entire
top
floor
a
strange
look
came
over
the
other
man
face
reaching
into
his
pocket
he
pulled
out
a
large
roll
of
bills
how
much
fifty
dollars
here
it
is
and
a
five
for
yourself
now
do
bother
me
again
and
with
that
the
man
strode
angrily
into
the
building
and
mounted
a
long
flight
of
stairs
which
led
to
the
top
floor
chapter
xi
a
visitor
penny
watched
the
janitor
closely
after
the
man
in
gray
had
vanished
into
the
building
from
his
inside
coat
pocket
he
removed
a
billfold
and
carefully
deposited
the
fifty
dollars
in
it
the
five
dollar
bill
he
shoved
into
his
trousers
pocket
a
possessive
smirk
on
his
face
penny
moved
forward
to
accost
the
man
how
do
you
do
she
greeted
are
you
the
custodian
of
this
building
yes
i
am
he
replied
surlily
if
you
have
anything
to
sell
get
out
oh
i
not
a
saleswoman
i
am
looking
for
a
place
to
rent
is
that
so
well
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
we
are
filled
up
penny
was
aware
that
the
janitor
regarded
her
suspiciously
she
did
not
believe
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
for
she
had
noticed
many
apparently
unoccupied
rooms
in
the
building
but
you
may
have
vacancies
in
the
future
i
suppose
she
commented
you
see
i
like
the
outlook
a
person
would
get
from
your
top
floor
that
top
floor
is
rented
could
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
party
no
i
could
the
janitor
interrupted
irritably
run
along
now
i
not
interested
in
your
chatter
all
right
i
go
penny
replied
but
you
may
hear
from
me
again
and
when
i
return
i
bring
a
mate
to
that
five
dollar
bill
you
just
slipped
into
your
pocket
before
the
man
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
she
turned
and
walked
briskly
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
her
father
office
she
deeply
regretted
her
last
remark
for
she
realized
that
the
janitor
might
repeat
it
to
the
man
who
occupied
the
top
floor
she
had
not
intended
to
reveal
how
much
she
had
seen
penny
entered
her
father
office
just
as
he
was
leaving
on
a
business
errand
hello
dad
she
called
out
i
seem
to
have
caught
the
bird
on
the
wing
nichols
smiled
at
his
young
daughter
and
obligingly
hung
his
hat
back
on
the
rack
my
flight
is
off
now
that
the
fledgling
has
returned
to
the
nest
what
on
your
mind
now
penny
this
little
ornament
for
one
thing
penny
unwrapped
the
model
of
the
black
imp
which
amy
coulter
had
given
her
and
set
it
down
on
her
father
desk
does
he
look
kind
of
lonesome
and
well
mysterious
he
does
at
that
nichols
said
as
he
picked
up
the
little
art
piece
and
turned
it
over
and
over
i
should
say
the
fellow
has
a
wicked
glint
to
his
eye
be
careful
how
you
handle
him
penny
warned
the
clay
is
still
damp
nichols
placed
the
figure
back
on
the
desk
it
a
very
clever
design
i
do
suppose
this
is
that
black
imp
you
were
telling
me
about
it
a
copy
of
the
original
how
did
you
get
it
i
guess
you
might
say
i
swiped
it
penny
smiled
or
rather
amy
and
i
did
together
you
do
make
yourself
very
clear
penny
related
her
experience
in
hanley
cron
studio
but
at
mention
of
the
jewelry
theft
nichols
lost
all
interest
in
the
black
imp
he
insisted
upon
hearing
every
detail
of
the
theft
it
does
surprise
me
a
bit
he
declared
when
penny
finished
the
story
i
warned
dillon
that
necklace
would
be
stolen
if
she
did
get
it
locked
up
she
lost
it
on
the
way
to
the
bank
dad
perhaps
she
thinks
now
that
if
she
had
attempted
to
follow
your
advice
the
pearls
would
still
be
safe
nonsense
nichols
exclaimed
impatiently
that
necklace
was
stolen
by
someone
who
was
lying
in
wait
for
her
possibly
by
one
of
the
same
thieves
who
attempted
to
hold
up
the
dillon
ball
the
other
evening
dillon
did
make
a
grave
mistake
to
carry
the
pearls
unguarded
penny
admitted
but
it
seems
to
me
the
thief
must
have
been
someone
who
was
in
the
house
after
the
holdup
why
do
you
think
that
because
otherwise
how
would
the
thief
have
known
that
dillon
intended
to
take
her
necklace
to
the
bank
today
you
remember
she
spoke
of
the
matter
openly
before
her
guests
i
remember
nichols
smiled
and
dillon
made
an
appointment
to
meet
hanley
cron
at
his
studio
before
she
went
to
the
bank
the
thief
apparently
was
waiting
for
her
in
front
of
the
building
it
was
no
casual
snatch
i
sure
of
that
your
reasoning
is
very
good
nichols
praised
tell
me
who
overheard
this
conversation
between
dillon
and
hanley
cron
why
i
did
there
were
some
other
people
standing
not
far
away
but
i
doubt
that
they
heard
at
least
they
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
so
you
the
only
person
who
knew
of
the
appointment
nichols
said
jokingly
do
look
at
me
like
that
penny
laughed
i
swear
i
did
take
the
necklace
even
if
i
was
on
the
scene
i
not
turn
you
over
to
the
police
without
more
evidence
the
detective
promised
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
the
station
when
you
dropped
in
i
did
mean
to
detain
you
the
matter
was
of
no
great
importance
i
merely
wanted
to
inquire
if
the
police
had
made
any
progress
tracing
the
dillon
holdup
men
queer
how
they
made
such
a
neat
i
do
think
the
police
are
very
alert
penny
grumbled
after
dillon
handbag
was
snatched
they
were
on
the
scene
within
ten
minutes
but
i
imagine
the
thief
will
never
be
captured
you
expect
results
too
quickly
penny
her
father
smiled
from
what
you
told
me
i
imagine
this
is
a
member
of
an
organized
gang
the
theft
was
no
casual
affair
every
detail
was
carefully
planned
i
wish
you
were
on
the
case
dad
i
do
i
have
enough
troubles
without
wishing
more
upon
myself
i
really
am
not
he
broke
off
as
the
telephone
rang
hello
he
said
gruffly
into
the
transmitter
then
his
face
became
sober
as
he
silently
listened
drop
into
my
office
tomorrow
at
nine
he
terminated
the
conversation
i
give
you
my
decision
then
you
sound
like
one
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
penny
chuckled
as
her
father
hung
up
the
receiver
what
this
momentous
decision
you
to
hand
down
nichols
sat
drumming
his
fingers
against
the
edge
of
the
desk
that
was
the
reliance
insurance
company
they
want
me
to
take
the
dillon
case
you
do
mean
in
regard
to
dillon
lost
necklace
yes
that
it
but
dad
how
does
the
insurance
company
figure
in
the
case
the
pearls
were
insured
as
it
happens
they
were
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
but
i
heard
dillon
say
to
you
herself
that
the
necklace
had
never
been
insured
yes
apparently
she
did
tell
the
truth
she
acted
dreadfully
upset
over
the
loss
what
reason
would
she
have
for
telling
you
a
deliberate
falsehood
about
the
insurance
i
wonder
myself
are
the
pearls
worth
fifteen
thousand
penny
asked
thoughtfully
no
more
than
that
certainly
it
seems
too
that
the
policy
was
taken
out
from
the
insurance
company
only
a
few
weeks
ago
the
company
does
think
that
the
robbery
was
planned
surely
it
was
planned
all
right
but
whether
by
dillon
i
in
no
position
to
say
but
why
should
she
wish
to
resort
to
such
a
trick
just
to
collect
insurance
penny
protested
the
dillons
are
wealthy
ostensibly
so
at
least
however
even
to
dillon
fifteen
thousand
might
look
attractive
i
do
believe
she
as
honest
as
she
should
be
penny
admitted
reluctantly
at
least
that
stolen
picture
is
in
her
favor
she
must
have
bought
it
with
a
full
knowledge
of
what
she
was
doing
christopher
nichols
nodded
thoughtfully
will
you
take
the
case
penny
questioned
hopefully
i
have
decided
yet
i
admit
i
beginning
to
grow
interested
in
it
while
the
two
were
talking
miss
arrow
the
secretary
swiftly
entered
the
room
i
sorry
to
interrupt
she
apologized
but
that
dreadful
man
is
here
again
which
dreadful
man
the
detective
inquired
smiling
max
lynch
oh
do
see
him
penny
pleaded
he
might
attempt
to
harm
you
dad
nichols
paid
no
heed
he
turned
to
miss
arrow
is
he
carrying
a
gun
i
do
think
so
nichols
but
i
could
be
certain
please
do
see
him
penny
begged
earnestly
max
lynch
has
a
grudge
against
you
now
do
get
yourself
worked
up
penny
he
chided
opening
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
to
make
certain
that
his
own
revolver
was
at
hand
for
immediate
use
in
an
emergency
i
be
in
no
danger
and
max
may
prove
useful
to
me
useful
yes
he
an
expert
on
jewels
and
it
a
well
known
fact
he
sometimes
handles
stolen
gems
you
think
he
may
know
something
about
dillon
necklace
i
do
suppose
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
theft
penny
but
likely
he
has
a
pretty
good
idea
who
handled
the
job
shall
i
tell
him
to
come
in
miss
arrow
questioned
yes
i
see
him
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
penny
said
reluctantly
please
the
detective
requested
miss
arrow
already
had
departed
as
penny
reached
the
door
she
met
max
lynch
coming
in
he
stood
aside
for
her
to
pass
but
there
was
no
deference
in
the
action
he
eyed
the
girl
insolently
your
daughter
nichols
he
demanded
yes
the
detective
answered
shortly
not
bad
looking
we
leave
her
out
of
the
conversation
nichols
said
sharply
what
brought
you
here
this
time
max
without
replying
lynch
leisurely
sat
down
in
a
chair
opposite
the
detective
he
calmly
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
on
the
desk
but
he
never
lighted
it
for
as
he
reached
into
his
pocket
after
a
match
he
noticed
an
object
directly
in
front
of
him
it
was
the
black
imp
for
an
instant
he
stared
at
the
figure
the
expression
of
completely
washed
from
his
face
he
hastily
arose
and
his
chair
as
he
pushed
it
back
made
a
harsh
grating
noise
on
the
floor
instinctively
christopher
nichols
hand
moved
swiftly
toward
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
but
there
was
no
need
for
alarm
max
lynch
did
not
reach
for
his
gun
instead
he
made
for
the
door
you
leaving
nichols
asked
max
did
not
reply
but
as
he
went
out
the
door
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
and
for
a
fleeting
moment
his
eyes
rested
in
fascinated
fear
on
the
figure
of
the
black
imp
chapter
xii
the
missing
workman
no
sooner
had
max
lynch
banged
out
of
the
office
than
penny
came
hurrying
in
what
happened
she
questioned
her
father
nothing
max
just
decided
to
leave
you
must
have
said
something
to
him
penny
insisted
when
he
went
out
he
looked
actually
frightened
his
face
was
as
white
as
if
seen
a
ghost
i
do
know
what
made
max
change
his
mind
about
wanting
to
talk
with
me
the
detective
said
frowning
thoughtfully
he
seemed
to
be
startled
when
he
saw
that
statue
of
yours
the
black
imp
penny
asked
in
surprise
yes
he
took
one
look
at
it
and
started
off
without
a
word
of
explanation
curiously
the
detective
picked
up
the
figure
and
carefully
examined
it
i
ca
see
anything
wrong
with
it
he
admitted
you
say
this
statue
came
from
hanley
cron
studio
yes
he
was
angry
when
amy
tried
to
take
it
away
from
him
then
the
policeman
came
in
and
he
seemed
afraid
to
protest
the
detective
made
no
reply
he
sat
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
arose
well
i
guess
i
amble
over
to
the
police
station
then
i
may
as
well
be
going
home
penny
said
she
picked
up
the
black
imp
from
the
desk
and
carefully
wrapped
it
i
take
you
in
the
car
if
you
like
no
i
walk
penny
replied
i
been
gaining
weight
lately
and
need
the
exercise
nichols
smiled
for
penny
barely
tipped
the
scales
at
a
hundred
pounds
they
left
the
building
together
and
separated
i
should
be
home
early
for
dinner
tonight
unless
something
unforeseen
comes
up
nichols
mentioned
in
parting
penny
found
gallup
ironing
in
the
kitchen
she
paused
to
display
the
black
imp
but
the
housekeeper
was
not
greatly
impressed
and
you
call
that
a
work
of
art
she
scoffed
it
just
an
old
lump
of
clay
this
is
only
a
copy
of
amy
coulter
fine
piece
gallup
not
a
very
good
copy
either
but
do
you
think
the
design
is
clever
i
ca
say
i
do
that
imp
has
such
a
sinister
look
on
his
face
as
if
he
were
guarding
a
wicked
secret
now
that
an
idea
penny
laughed
maybe
he
is
at
least
he
frightened
a
crook
out
of
dad
office
this
afternoon
what
was
that
gallup
demanded
quickly
penny
did
not
repeat
for
she
had
no
desire
to
alarm
the
housekeeper
after
all
she
could
not
be
certain
that
the
black
imp
had
been
the
cause
of
max
lynch
sudden
leave
taking
oh
i
was
just
talking
she
murmured
and
departed
before
gallup
could
question
her
further
penny
took
the
little
statue
to
her
room
and
after
trying
it
in
several
locations
decided
that
it
looked
best
on
the
maple
desk
she
then
sat
down
to
write
a
few
lines
in
her
diary
but
whenever
she
glanced
up
the
black
imp
seemed
to
be
staring
down
at
her
with
an
inquiring
scrutiny
you
are
a
wicked
little
beast
penny
chuckled
are
you
trying
to
learn
what
i
writing
about
the
jewelry
theft
she
turned
the
black
imp
so
that
he
faced
the
wall
and
finished
the
notation
in
her
diary
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
five
when
penny
heard
the
front
door
bell
ring
thinking
that
one
of
her
school
chums
had
come
to
call
she
darted
down
the
stairs
to
answer
the
visitor
was
dillon
why
how
do
you
do
penny
stammered
wo
you
come
in
she
wondered
what
had
brought
the
woman
to
the
house
at
such
a
late
hour
of
the
afternoon
a
conviction
dawned
upon
her
that
dillon
had
learned
of
the
hoax
she
and
amy
had
perpetrated
in
order
to
see
the
rembrandt
she
steeled
herself
for
an
unpleasant
interview
is
your
father
here
dillon
inquired
no
dillon
he
has
returned
from
the
office
it
very
important
that
i
see
him
about
my
stolen
necklace
you
know
a
feeling
of
relief
surged
over
penny
father
should
be
arriving
any
moment
now
would
you
care
to
wait
yes
i
believe
i
will
dillon
sank
wearily
into
the
chair
which
the
girl
offered
had
such
a
dreadful
day
my
beautiful
necklace
was
stolen
and
the
police
have
been
able
to
find
a
trace
of
the
thief
but
then
you
know
all
about
it
for
you
were
there
perhaps
the
pearls
will
still
be
recovered
penny
said
politely
that
what
cron
tells
me
he
says
it
foolish
of
me
to
worry
the
police
are
certain
to
find
them
within
a
few
days
your
loss
was
covered
by
insurance
penny
inquired
innocently
oh
no
that
the
dreadful
part
penny
looked
sharply
at
dillon
the
woman
seemed
so
earnest
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
she
was
deliberately
telling
a
falsehood
yet
the
incident
of
the
painting
already
had
given
the
girl
a
clue
as
to
dillon
character
if
the
woman
knowingly
would
purchase
a
stolen
picture
was
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
she
would
feel
no
qualms
at
cheating
an
insurance
company
in
the
hope
of
gaining
a
little
information
penny
casually
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
rembrandt
but
dillon
immediately
became
secretive
she
would
not
talk
of
the
picture
even
in
a
general
way
i
never
learn
anything
except
by
making
a
direct
accusation
penny
thought
i
do
dare
do
that
yet
she
was
relieved
when
her
father
came
a
few
minutes
later
i
sorry
to
bother
you
at
your
home
dillon
began
nervously
but
i
had
to
see
you
at
once
my
pearl
necklace
was
stolen
this
afternoon
yes
so
i
heard
nichols
replied
i
want
you
to
take
the
case
you
must
help
me
recover
my
pearls
i
am
afraid
i
ca
take
the
case
mrs
dillon
but
why
not
you
helped
others
everyone
says
you
are
the
best
detective
in
the
city
and
i
pay
you
well
it
is
a
matter
of
money
dillon
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
reliance
insurance
company
also
requested
me
to
work
on
the
case
the
reliance
insurance
company
i
do
understand
what
have
they
to
do
with
it
your
necklace
was
insured
with
them
i
believe
nichols
said
evenly
oh
no
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
certainly
not
dillon
replied
indignantly
are
you
suggesting
that
i
would
lie
about
the
matter
i
thought
you
might
have
forgotten
this
is
too
ridiculous
dillon
snapped
i
did
come
here
to
be
insulted
please
do
consider
my
remarks
in
that
light
dillon
i
was
merely
explaining
why
i
ca
take
the
case
i
expect
to
serve
the
reliance
company
they
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
necklace
dillon
angrily
arose
i
am
sorry
i
wasted
my
time
coming
here
haughtily
she
left
the
house
and
penny
who
watched
from
the
window
saw
her
drive
away
with
her
chauffeur
do
you
really
intend
to
take
the
case
for
the
reliance
people
she
questioned
eagerly
oh
i
suppose
i
shall
what
do
you
think
of
dillon
dad
she
bores
me
nichols
yawned
without
a
background
of
money
and
social
position
she
would
be
nothing
but
a
noisy
phonograph
record
i
meant
about
her
claim
regarding
the
necklace
were
the
pearls
actually
insured
oh
of
course
nichols
returned
a
trifle
impatiently
he
laughed
i
ca
imagine
the
reliance
people
turning
over
a
cold
fifteen
thousand
dollars
if
they
did
owe
it
but
if
dillon
expects
to
collect
the
money
why
should
she
lie
the
detective
shrugged
some
women
are
funny
gallup
came
to
announce
dinner
and
at
the
table
the
subject
was
not
resumed
penny
sighed
as
she
stole
a
glance
at
her
immobile
face
she
could
never
tell
what
he
was
thinking
and
his
reluctance
to
discuss
any
case
upon
which
he
happened
to
be
working
was
at
times
irritating
the
next
morning
after
helping
gallup
wash
windows
penny
went
down
town
to
have
luncheon
with
her
father
she
felt
rather
important
as
she
entered
the
office
for
it
was
not
often
that
he
extended
such
an
invitation
the
door
of
the
inner
room
was
ajar
and
miss
arrow
was
nowhere
in
sight
so
penny
entered
to
her
surprise
the
private
office
was
in
great
confusion
papers
had
been
tossed
over
the
floor
and
the
filing
cabinet
rifled
nichols
and
his
secretary
were
occupied
examining
the
contents
of
the
safe
what
the
matter
penny
questioned
are
you
house
cleaning
or
did
a
cyclone
strike
the
place
someone
broke
in
here
last
night
and
went
through
everything
nichols
answered
anything
valuable
taken
no
not
so
far
as
we
discovered
only
a
little
cash
that
was
in
the
safe
nothing
of
consequence
who
do
you
suppose
did
it
penny
asked
she
leaned
carelessly
against
the
desk
but
her
father
pulled
her
away
be
careful
where
you
park
yourself
he
ordered
i
have
finished
taking
finger
prints
yet
penny
waited
while
miss
arrow
and
her
father
made
a
systematic
inventory
of
the
contents
of
the
room
they
were
both
too
busy
to
talk
at
one
penny
grew
discouraged
how
much
longer
before
you
be
ready
to
go
to
lunch
dad
oh
an
hour
at
least
then
i
guess
i
go
by
myself
i
dreadfully
hungry
good
idea
the
detective
approved
you
might
have
some
sandwiches
and
coffee
sent
in
for
miss
arrow
and
myself
he
tossed
her
a
bill
and
went
on
with
his
work
at
a
nearby
restaurant
penny
ordered
luncheon
for
herself
and
had
a
package
of
cold
food
and
a
large
thermos
bottle
of
coffee
dispatched
to
her
father
office
she
ate
somewhat
mechanically
as
she
reflected
upon
the
audacity
of
the
person
who
had
dared
to
rifle
her
father
office
a
few
years
before
she
recalled
that
a
thief
had
broken
into
the
safe
but
he
had
been
captured
within
hours
as
penny
left
the
restaurant
she
purchased
a
newspaper
and
glanced
at
the
headlines
the
story
of
the
dillon
robbery
appeared
in
column
one
but
the
details
were
not
given
very
accurately
penny
folded
the
paper
and
walked
slowly
down
the
street
having
no
destination
in
mind
she
wandered
toward
the
park
seating
herself
on
a
bench
she
idly
watched
the
passersby
presently
her
attention
was
drawn
to
a
man
who
had
paused
near
a
large
tree
not
far
away
he
appeared
strangely
familiar
but
at
first
glance
penny
did
not
recognize
him
she
scrutinized
him
closely
he
wore
dark
glasses
and
kept
the
brim
of
his
broad
hat
pulled
low
why
it
mr
hoges
penny
thought
the
museum
workman
she
felt
certain
that
the
man
had
not
worn
dark
glasses
when
she
had
seen
him
at
the
gage
galleries
he
was
well
dressed
even
expensively
yet
she
knew
the
salary
he
had
received
from
the
museum
could
not
be
a
large
one
hoges
was
supposed
to
be
out
of
the
city
on
vacation
too
she
reflected
i
think
i
go
over
and
talk
with
him
before
she
could
move
from
the
bench
she
saw
the
man
take
out
his
watch
and
stare
at
it
then
he
gazed
impatiently
up
and
down
the
walk
as
if
he
were
expecting
someone
penny
kept
her
head
bent
and
he
did
not
bestow
a
second
glance
in
her
direction
she
thought
i
just
wait
and
see
for
whom
he
waiting
i
may
learn
more
that
way
ten
minutes
passed
hoges
grew
more
impatient
he
paced
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
tree
then
abruptly
he
halted
and
his
face
lighted
up
from
the
other
side
of
the
park
a
girl
in
a
blue
coat
rapidly
approached
as
she
hurried
up
to
the
waiting
hoges
her
face
was
slightly
averted
i
sorry
to
be
late
she
murmured
the
voice
was
musical
and
low
penny
recognized
it
instantly
yet
found
it
difficult
to
believe
her
own
ears
if
only
the
girl
would
turn
her
head
just
then
she
did
and
penny
could
no
longer
hope
that
she
had
been
mistaken
the
newcomer
was
amy
coulter
chapter
xiii
an
embarrassing
interview
at
sight
of
her
friend
talking
with
the
museum
workman
a
confusion
of
thoughts
raced
through
penny
mind
why
had
amy
made
an
appointment
with
him
in
the
park
she
could
not
believe
that
the
meeting
was
casual
for
the
girl
own
words
had
revealed
otherwise
she
was
even
more
startled
by
amy
next
remark
which
carried
by
the
wind
came
to
her
very
clearly
you
brought
the
money
yes
i
will
pay
you
now
if
you
wish
the
workman
drew
from
his
inner
pocket
a
fat
wallet
removing
a
large
roll
of
bills
penny
was
so
bewildered
that
for
a
moment
she
forgot
to
shield
her
face
with
the
newspaper
she
pretended
to
read
however
amy
and
the
man
were
so
engrossed
in
their
conversation
neither
of
them
glanced
toward
the
park
bench
hoges
stripped
off
two
of
the
bills
handing
them
to
the
girl
there
he
said
in
a
gruff
voice
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
a
start
stick
by
me
sister
and
you
earn
plenty
more
like
it
amy
made
no
response
but
pocketed
the
money
she
was
moving
away
when
the
workman
detained
her
you
understand
what
expected
you
keep
quiet
if
anyone
asks
you
how
you
make
your
money
i
have
made
much
yet
you
will
never
fear
if
my
little
plan
goes
through
do
i
have
your
promise
to
keep
silent
yes
amy
answered
shortly
she
jerked
away
from
hoges
and
hurried
off
through
the
park
penny
was
so
absorbed
in
the
little
scene
that
she
did
not
hear
footsteps
behind
her
hello
penny
a
teasing
voice
greeted
what
are
you
doing
here
penny
sprang
up
from
the
park
bench
then
laughed
ruefully
as
she
saw
that
it
was
susan
altman
who
had
spoken
to
her
so
unexpectedly
my
you
surely
startled
me
susan
what
are
you
doing
here
all
by
yourself
oh
just
watching
the
birds
and
squirrels
and
things
human
squirrels
i
suppose
susan
smiled
when
i
came
up
you
were
craning
your
neck
at
that
man
over
by
the
oak
tree
what
became
of
him
penny
demanded
anxiously
turning
to
look
she
had
talked
with
susan
scarcely
a
minute
yet
the
museum
workman
had
disappeared
in
vain
she
scanned
the
park
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
thought
you
were
interested
in
him
susan
proclaimed
triumphantly
of
course
i
was
penny
cried
impatiently
he
was
that
same
museum
workman
we
met
at
the
gage
galleries
not
the
one
you
suspected
of
stealing
the
rembrandt
yes
and
he
was
talking
with
penny
suddenly
checked
herself
what
were
you
saying
he
was
talking
with
a
girl
penny
finished
i
intended
to
follow
the
man
now
it
too
late
i
guess
it
was
my
fault
but
i
did
suppose
you
were
really
shadowing
anyone
i
sorry
if
i
ruined
everything
oh
you
did
penny
smiled
taking
her
chum
arm
as
they
walked
across
the
park
together
if
i
want
to
question
hoges
i
probably
can
find
him
at
the
museum
no
doubt
he
just
returned
from
his
vacation
the
girls
dropped
in
at
a
corner
drug
store
for
ice
cream
but
penny
refrained
from
telling
susan
the
details
of
her
recent
adventures
she
realized
that
if
it
became
generally
known
that
the
stolen
rembrandt
or
even
a
reproduction
of
the
famous
picture
were
in
possession
considerable
trouble
would
result
penny
did
not
intend
to
tell
anyone
about
it
until
she
had
interviewed
the
woman
it
was
after
three
when
the
girls
left
the
drug
store
at
penny
suggestion
they
walked
to
the
gage
galleries
to
inquire
for
hoges
he
will
not
return
here
after
his
vacation
came
the
disappointing
response
to
their
question
hoges
has
resigned
his
position
this
information
left
penny
in
more
of
a
maze
than
ever
regarding
amy
coulter
she
could
not
help
believing
in
the
girl
integrity
and
despite
amy
rendezvous
with
hoges
she
still
felt
there
must
be
a
rational
explanation
for
her
actions
as
susan
and
penny
left
the
museum
together
the
former
cast
a
glance
at
her
watch
it
nearly
four
and
i
promised
to
meet
my
mother
at
the
library
then
i
forgot
all
about
it
i
have
just
ten
minutes
to
get
there
twenty
blocks
in
ten
minutes
you
never
make
it
susan
the
excited
girl
looked
up
and
down
the
street
as
if
she
were
seeking
some
miraculous
means
of
quick
transportation
just
then
a
taxicab
whirled
around
the
corner
susan
held
up
her
hand
as
a
signal
for
it
to
stop
you
do
mind
do
you
penny
mother
will
be
so
exasperated
if
i
do
come
hop
in
with
me
and
i
drop
you
off
downtown
no
thanks
susan
penny
excused
herself
i
just
thought
of
a
place
i
want
to
stop
and
it
is
on
your
route
see
you
tomorrow
the
cab
door
slammed
and
susan
was
whisked
away
to
her
appointment
penny
walked
rapidly
toward
the
poorer
section
of
the
business
district
she
finally
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
building
where
the
previous
day
she
had
encountered
the
mysterious
man
in
gray
and
the
arrogant
janitor
penny
walked
into
the
stuffy
little
lobby
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
stairway
she
consulted
a
dilapidated
office
directory
which
hung
haphazardly
against
the
wall
the
building
was
tenanted
by
small
factories
printers
and
agents
about
half
the
spaces
in
the
directory
were
blank
indicating
the
place
was
only
partially
occupied
she
was
interested
to
see
that
the
top
floor
showed
no
tenants
whatsoever
i
think
i
just
slip
up
there
and
see
for
myself
she
resolved
with
her
foot
on
the
first
step
she
looked
quickly
about
there
was
no
one
nearby
to
witness
her
actions
all
was
quiet
except
for
the
rhythmical
thumping
of
small
job
presses
in
the
scattered
printing
shops
penny
thought
there
could
hardly
be
so
many
steep
steps
in
all
the
world
as
she
climbed
flight
after
flight
hoping
each
to
be
the
last
finally
she
reached
the
top
landing
she
tiptoed
to
the
nearest
door
and
listened
hearing
nothing
she
opened
it
a
crack
and
looked
in
the
place
was
empty
that
queer
she
thought
i
sure
this
top
floor
was
rented
yesterday
i
saw
the
man
pay
the
rent
walking
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
penny
explored
the
large
room
here
and
there
on
the
bare
floor
were
colored
splotches
as
if
someone
had
spilled
paint
in
one
corner
was
a
dirty
piece
of
tarpaulin
such
as
tradesmen
use
to
protect
floors
and
furniture
disappointed
penny
retreated
to
the
hallway
she
could
not
understand
why
the
place
was
empty
when
she
had
been
told
by
the
janitor
only
the
day
before
that
it
was
occupied
she
walked
slowly
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
and
as
she
turned
on
the
landing
to
continue
her
descent
she
noticed
the
name
james
wilson
printer
on
a
glass
door
directly
in
front
of
her
the
name
seemed
strangely
familiar
then
she
remembered
it
must
be
the
shop
of
jimmy
wilson
who
did
some
of
her
father
printing
penny
opened
the
door
and
there
was
jimmy
himself
feeding
envelopes
into
a
small
job
press
he
looked
up
from
his
work
when
he
saw
her
stopping
his
machine
to
say
well
if
it
is
miss
nichols
rush
order
from
your
father
i
bet
not
this
time
wilson
but
i
do
wonder
if
you
could
give
me
a
little
information
i
tell
you
anything
but
my
lodge
secrets
jimmy
replied
i
want
to
know
what
became
of
the
tenants
on
the
floor
above
if
the
printer
was
surprised
at
such
a
direct
question
his
expression
did
not
disclose
it
oh
the
janitor
was
telling
me
about
that
miss
nichols
he
said
they
moved
out
bag
and
baggage
during
the
night
last
night
penny
inquired
quickly
yes
seems
their
rent
was
paid
up
a
week
ahead
too
what
sort
of
place
did
they
run
well
they
claimed
to
be
sign
painters
but
i
could
tell
you
about
that
in
an
old
building
like
this
a
lot
of
strange
specimens
come
and
go
did
you
notice
the
man
who
rented
the
floor
not
particularly
there
seemed
to
be
three
of
them
a
tall
rather
well
dressed
man
and
two
kind
of
looking
foreigners
sometimes
when
i
worked
late
in
my
shop
i
could
hear
them
up
there
messing
around
long
into
the
night
further
questioning
failed
to
bring
out
any
vital
information
and
not
wishing
to
arouse
the
printer
suspicions
penny
thanked
him
and
descended
to
the
street
she
was
disappointed
at
her
failure
to
find
the
upper
floor
of
the
building
occupied
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
possibly
her
own
actions
had
caused
the
sudden
departure
the
janitor
may
have
mentioned
to
that
man
in
gray
that
i
came
here
yesterday
she
reflected
but
why
should
it
make
any
difference
penny
was
certain
that
the
man
she
had
followed
to
the
building
had
previously
made
a
business
of
shadowing
her
she
had
never
seen
him
before
in
her
life
and
could
not
understand
why
her
movements
should
interest
him
the
riddle
is
too
involved
for
me
she
told
herself
i
guess
one
mystery
at
a
time
is
enough
to
worry
about
it
was
still
fairly
early
in
the
afternoon
and
penny
did
not
wish
to
waste
the
day
she
decided
to
make
a
bold
move
and
call
upon
dillon
yet
she
dreaded
the
interview
taking
a
bus
she
soon
arrived
at
the
society
woman
home
when
she
rang
the
doorbell
the
maid
who
answered
recognized
her
immediately
her
glance
was
not
friendly
is
dillon
in
penny
inquired
yes
but
i
not
sure
she
see
you
the
maid
answered
shortly
when
i
told
her
you
were
here
the
other
day
to
see
the
picture
she
did
know
anything
about
it
did
you
tell
her
my
name
how
could
i
when
you
would
give
it
penny
smiled
please
tell
dillon
that
miss
nichols
would
like
to
speak
with
her
you
might
add
that
the
matter
is
important
i
tell
her
the
maid
said
reluctantly
penny
waited
several
minutes
but
when
the
servant
came
back
she
was
more
cordial
dillon
will
see
you
in
the
drawing
room
the
woman
arose
as
penny
entered
i
am
very
glad
you
came
this
afternoon
she
said
pleasantly
i
intended
to
telephone
your
father
but
now
you
may
give
him
my
message
i
be
glad
to
mrs
dillon
i
owe
your
father
an
apology
about
the
way
i
talked
to
him
you
see
i
did
know
that
my
pearl
necklace
was
insured
and
you
have
since
learned
differently
penny
asked
politely
yes
my
husband
told
me
last
night
he
insured
the
pearls
without
telling
me
anything
about
it
was
that
fortunate
very
penny
agreed
i
suppose
you
feel
greatly
relieved
oh
yes
but
i
still
wish
your
father
would
take
the
case
give
him
my
apology
yes
indeed
there
was
a
little
awkward
silence
as
dillon
waited
for
penny
to
explain
why
she
had
called
the
girl
scarcely
knew
how
to
begin
she
had
been
disarmed
as
it
were
by
the
society
woman
manner
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
a
picture
which
was
taken
from
the
gage
galleries
she
began
hesitantly
a
rembrandt
a
cold
look
came
over
dillon
face
yes
she
inquired
penny
stirred
uncomfortably
the
interview
was
not
to
her
liking
and
when
her
father
learned
of
it
she
was
afraid
it
might
not
be
to
his
liking
either
it
occurred
to
me
dillon
that
possibly
you
could
help
in
locating
the
stolen
picture
i
you
flatter
me
my
dear
penny
saw
the
warning
in
dillon
dark
eyes
but
she
dared
to
go
on
let
not
pretend
dillon
she
said
quietly
i
know
about
that
painting
which
you
keep
hidden
behind
the
panel
of
the
library
dillon
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
convulsed
with
anger
so
you
are
the
snooper
who
came
here
she
cried
get
out
of
my
house
and
never
never
come
again
go
quickly
or
i
call
the
police
chapter
xiv
the
mysterious
agent
penny
listened
calmly
to
the
woman
tirade
making
no
move
to
obey
the
impolite
command
i
am
sorry
dillon
she
said
but
i
do
not
intend
to
leave
this
house
until
you
have
answered
my
questions
i
shall
call
my
servant
you
are
an
insolent
impudent
girl
i
should
advise
you
not
to
call
anyone
until
we
have
talked
together
penny
said
undisturbed
after
all
you
know
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
cause
your
arrest
dillon
grew
pale
what
do
you
mean
she
demanded
it
is
useless
to
pretend
i
know
that
you
bought
the
rembrandt
and
have
it
secreted
in
your
library
unless
you
tell
me
where
you
purchased
the
painting
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
go
to
the
police
and
if
i
do
tell
you
perhaps
i
can
help
you
you
should
be
able
to
escape
arrest
for
the
rembrandt
is
genuine
as
she
had
anticipated
her
words
brought
an
astonished
glint
into
dillon
eyes
without
thinking
she
exclaimed
the
painting
is
genuine
i
paid
how
much
did
you
pay
for
it
penny
questioned
smiling
at
dillon
confusion
well
since
you
seem
to
be
so
familiar
with
my
private
affairs
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
all
about
it
the
painting
is
genuine
and
i
bought
it
with
the
sole
intention
of
returning
it
to
the
museum
penny
made
no
comment
although
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
story
dillon
was
only
trying
to
build
up
a
defense
for
herself
how
much
did
you
pay
for
the
picture
she
repeated
determined
to
tie
the
woman
to
facts
two
thousand
dollars
dillon
answered
grudgingly
but
that
is
only
the
first
payment
the
next
installment
will
soon
be
due
penny
thought
exultingly
if
dillon
will
only
cooperate
it
should
be
possible
to
catch
the
dealer
who
cheated
her
aloud
she
said
then
you
will
see
the
dealer
again
the
man
from
whom
you
purchased
the
picture
not
the
dealer
his
agent
tell
me
the
name
of
the
persons
from
whom
you
bought
the
painting
i
ca
you
are
unwilling
to
do
so
you
mean
i
do
know
the
dealer
name
i
never
dealt
with
him
personally
you
bought
the
picture
through
a
third
party
yes
and
the
agent
is
very
well
known
to
me
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
penny
could
not
restrain
a
smile
she
had
her
own
opinion
of
a
man
who
would
negotiate
a
deal
for
a
stolen
painting
who
is
this
agent
mrs
dillon
that
i
can
not
tell
you
i
promised
never
to
reveal
his
name
but
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
penny
urged
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
has
cheated
you
i
will
not
give
his
name
dillon
repeated
firmly
he
is
a
special
friend
of
yours
perhaps
i
appreciate
your
motive
in
trying
to
shield
him
penny
said
but
the
matter
is
serious
this
man
has
sold
you
a
worthless
picture
representing
it
to
be
a
stolen
rembrandt
the
painting
is
genuine
dillon
insisted
i
have
proof
of
it
what
proof
may
i
ask
the
picture
was
viewed
by
an
expert
a
man
whose
judgment
i
trust
implicitly
he
assured
me
that
it
was
genuine
this
expert
looked
at
your
picture
since
it
was
delivered
to
the
house
no
at
the
studio
what
studio
penny
asked
quickly
i
will
tell
you
if
you
promise
not
to
betray
me
to
the
police
i
came
here
today
because
i
wanted
to
help
you
dillon
i
have
no
intention
of
going
to
the
authorities
if
it
can
be
avoided
the
studio
is
on
franklyn
street
the
woman
informed
on
an
upper
floor
do
you
have
the
exact
number
of
the
building
penny
asked
quickly
yes
somewhere
dillon
went
to
her
desk
and
after
examining
a
number
of
papers
found
an
old
envelope
upon
which
she
had
written
the
address
penny
glanced
at
it
and
a
look
of
disappointment
came
over
her
face
oh
this
clue
will
do
no
good
she
exclaimed
i
know
about
this
place
the
men
have
gone
they
moved
out
last
night
secretly
the
address
was
the
same
building
which
penny
had
investigated
that
afternoon
can
you
describe
the
person
or
persons
whom
you
met
in
the
studio
dillon
shook
her
head
i
did
not
meet
the
men
personally
my
friend
took
me
there
and
showed
me
the
picture
this
same
expert
to
whom
you
referred
yes
and
yet
you
feel
that
his
judgment
was
unbiased
i
do
dillon
maintained
loyally
but
i
did
not
depend
entirely
upon
his
opinion
i
am
a
very
good
judge
of
pictures
myself
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
possibly
you
did
not
receive
the
same
painting
which
you
purchased
i
understand
that
sometimes
art
thieves
prey
upon
innocent
buyers
by
showing
them
a
genuine
picture
and
then
delivering
into
their
hands
only
a
cheap
copy
i
am
too
shrewd
to
be
so
easily
duped
dillon
retorted
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
protected
myself
against
just
such
trickery
how
when
i
viewed
the
picture
and
satisfied
myself
as
to
its
quality
i
marked
the
back
of
the
canvas
with
a
tiny
symbol
in
that
way
you
see
another
painting
could
not
be
substituted
for
the
marking
would
be
absent
the
symbol
might
be
duplicated
no
i
would
instantly
detect
the
difference
penny
sat
lost
in
thought
for
a
moment
she
now
understood
the
significance
of
the
strange
marking
on
the
back
of
the
rembrandt
which
had
puzzled
amy
and
herself
was
it
possible
that
the
coulter
girl
had
been
mistaken
in
the
quality
of
the
painting
dillon
she
said
after
a
long
silence
you
confidently
believe
that
your
painting
is
the
same
one
which
was
stolen
from
the
gage
galleries
all
i
know
is
that
my
picture
is
a
genuine
rembrandt
i
did
not
learn
that
a
picture
had
been
stolen
from
the
museum
until
after
i
had
made
my
purchase
i
do
not
know
even
now
that
i
have
this
same
painting
in
the
event
that
it
is
the
same
you
wish
to
return
it
to
the
museum
dillon
glared
at
penny
in
frank
dislike
she
had
been
fairly
trapped
and
knew
it
of
course
she
replied
coldly
i
hope
you
do
not
think
i
would
intentionally
keep
stolen
property
i
thought
you
would
see
it
that
way
penny
declared
smiling
and
with
your
cooperation
the
police
should
be
able
to
capture
the
real
culprits
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
when
will
you
see
this
agent
with
whom
you
dealt
he
is
coming
either
today
or
tomorrow
for
the
second
payment
i
do
need
to
advise
you
to
refuse
to
give
him
any
more
money
but
i
wish
you
would
try
to
learn
from
him
the
names
of
the
original
dealers
who
handled
the
picture
i
try
to
find
out
and
another
thing
dillon
you
must
notify
the
gage
galleries
immediately
that
you
have
the
rembrandt
the
woman
made
no
response
you
will
do
that
penny
asked
yes
dillon
answered
harshly
i
see
you
again
tomorrow
penny
said
arising
to
depart
until
then
you
have
my
promise
that
i
will
not
talk
with
the
police
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
dillon
announced
proudly
not
if
you
show
a
willingness
to
cooperate
penny
agreed
when
you
think
the
matter
over
i
believe
you
will
decide
to
reveal
the
name
of
your
friend
the
agent
who
negotiated
the
sale
she
waited
an
instant
hoping
that
dillon
would
reconsider
when
the
woman
did
not
speak
she
turned
and
walked
from
the
living
room
letting
herself
out
the
front
door
emerging
upon
the
street
penny
first
thought
was
to
find
a
good
hiding
place
where
she
could
wait
to
view
dillon
expected
caller
i
may
have
a
tedious
time
of
it
she
reflected
but
if
i
learn
the
identity
of
the
agent
with
whom
she
dealt
it
will
be
worth
all
the
trouble
a
half
block
away
she
noticed
a
large
truck
parked
along
the
curbing
the
vehicle
had
been
abandoned
a
front
wheel
giving
mute
evidence
that
it
had
been
in
an
accident
the
truck
was
of
the
closed
cab
type
and
it
dawned
upon
penny
that
if
she
could
get
inside
she
would
have
a
perfect
observation
post
luckily
the
cab
of
the
truck
had
not
been
locked
and
she
slipped
into
the
driver
seat
slamming
the
door
shut
an
hour
passed
the
job
of
watching
dillon
house
became
irksome
no
one
had
called
except
a
peddler
and
a
delivery
boy
from
a
laundry
penny
tried
to
pass
the
time
by
examining
the
many
gadgets
with
which
the
great
truck
was
equipped
she
imagined
that
it
might
be
loads
of
fun
to
drive
such
a
powerful
machine
suddenly
her
attention
was
arrested
by
an
automobile
which
with
a
shrill
screeching
of
brakes
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
dillon
residence
a
man
carrying
a
black
leather
brief
case
got
out
of
the
car
penny
was
sure
she
had
never
seen
him
before
she
observed
him
closely
as
he
emerged
from
his
automobile
he
crossed
the
street
with
a
quick
energetic
stride
as
if
he
knew
just
where
he
was
going
and
what
he
intended
doing
after
he
arrived
she
saw
him
standing
patiently
at
dillon
door
waiting
for
a
servant
to
answer
his
ring
was
the
man
the
agent
dillon
had
mentioned
the
rogue
who
had
sold
the
fake
painting
to
the
gullible
woman
he
certainly
did
not
look
like
a
crook
penny
thought
nor
did
he
act
like
one
just
one
more
reason
she
decided
why
she
must
take
nothing
for
granted
she
produced
a
notebook
and
pencil
from
her
purse
and
made
a
careful
notation
of
the
stranger
automobile
license
number
as
well
as
its
make
and
model
for
perhaps
minutes
the
man
remained
inside
the
house
when
he
crossed
the
street
to
his
car
he
skipped
along
with
an
agility
surprising
in
a
man
of
his
years
he
smiled
broadly
as
if
his
mission
whatever
it
may
have
been
was
successful
scarcely
had
he
driven
away
when
another
automobile
swung
into
the
same
parking
space
from
her
place
of
advantage
penny
fixed
her
attention
on
the
newcomer
but
before
she
could
see
his
face
she
was
startled
by
a
gruff
voice
almost
in
her
ear
hey
there
come
down
out
of
that
a
roughly
dressed
truck
driver
stood
on
the
running
board
gesturing
angrily
what
do
you
think
this
truck
is
he
demanded
a
free
park
seat
penny
hastily
climbed
out
of
the
cab
making
an
offhand
apology
for
her
presence
okay
miss
the
truck
driver
said
seein
as
you
a
gal
but
if
you
had
been
a
man
i
would
have
taken
a
fall
out
of
ya
it
a
crime
that
a
man
ca
go
for
help
without
having
some
strange
sister
cuddle
down
in
his
cab
the
trucker
loud
gruff
voice
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
man
in
the
parked
automobile
he
stepped
from
his
car
and
came
toward
the
couple
what
the
idea
of
abusing
a
helpless
young
girl
he
asked
penny
recognized
the
voice
and
resisted
an
impulse
to
turn
her
head
she
knew
that
the
newcomer
was
hanley
cron
he
had
come
to
call
upon
dillon
that
was
plain
she
must
not
let
him
discover
that
she
was
watching
the
house
quickly
before
either
of
the
men
were
aware
of
her
intention
she
darted
behind
the
truck
and
fled
down
the
street
chapter
xv
a
puzzling
letter
rounding
the
corner
at
the
end
of
the
street
penny
paused
to
catch
her
breath
it
had
been
foolish
to
run
away
she
realized
that
now
but
she
had
acted
impulsively
without
thinking
she
thought
hopefully
that
hanley
cron
might
not
have
recognized
her
she
was
certain
he
had
not
seen
her
face
penny
walked
slowly
home
she
was
as
bewildered
as
ever
regarding
the
identity
of
the
mysterious
agent
who
had
sold
dillon
the
rembrandt
it
might
have
been
the
first
caller
or
perhaps
hanley
cron
yet
penny
smiled
as
she
considered
the
latter
possibility
cron
held
an
enviable
position
with
a
newspaper
he
was
highly
respected
in
art
circles
and
besides
was
a
special
friend
of
dillon
it
seemed
far
more
likely
that
he
had
merely
dropped
in
to
pay
a
casual
afternoon
call
penny
wondered
if
she
had
acted
wisely
in
talking
so
frankly
with
the
society
woman
dillon
fearful
of
arrest
had
agreed
to
communicate
with
the
museum
authorities
but
would
she
keep
her
promise
penny
could
only
wait
and
hope
that
she
had
acted
for
the
best
it
was
nearing
the
dinner
hour
when
she
reached
home
nichols
whose
hobby
was
gardening
rested
on
his
hoe
as
his
daughter
came
up
the
stepping
stone
path
she
thought
he
looked
worried
and
spoke
of
it
i
am
worried
the
detective
confessed
some
confounded
new
fangled
bug
is
eating
up
all
my
choice
aster
plants
just
look
at
this
one
riddled
with
holes
as
if
it
had
been
peppered
with
a
machine
gun
penny
laughed
as
she
bent
down
to
pick
a
bouquet
of
flowers
for
the
dinner
table
you
ought
to
be
able
to
solve
a
simple
case
like
that
she
teased
i
already
sprayed
the
plants
with
everything
i
can
think
of
disgusting
penny
was
not
especially
interested
in
insects
and
began
to
question
her
father
about
the
office
robbery
nothing
valuable
was
stolen
so
far
as
miss
arrow
and
i
could
determine
he
informed
the
office
was
pretty
thoroughly
torn
up
but
apparently
the
thief
did
get
the
thing
he
was
after
have
you
any
idea
what
that
was
dad
not
the
slightest
papers
of
some
sort
i
suppose
did
you
find
any
leading
clues
nothing
of
consequence
the
fingerprints
were
worthless
for
the
thief
wore
gloves
would
you
like
to
have
the
case
penny
no
thanks
i
involved
myself
in
enough
trouble
as
it
is
you
may
not
like
what
i
done
dad
and
just
what
have
you
done
the
detective
asked
with
twinkling
eyes
penny
gave
a
detailed
account
of
her
interview
with
dillon
nichols
frowned
thoughtfully
but
did
not
chide
her
you
made
a
bold
attack
penny
he
commented
but
perhaps
no
harm
has
been
done
however
after
this
i
must
ask
you
not
to
do
anything
about
the
matter
without
consulting
me
you
see
i
taken
the
jewel
theft
case
for
the
insurance
company
and
i
ca
afford
to
antagonize
dillon
until
i
learn
whether
she
is
involved
in
a
plot
to
obtain
fifteen
thousand
dollars
under
false
pretenses
you
and
dillon
did
part
upon
such
friendly
terms
the
last
time
you
met
penny
reminded
him
with
a
smile
no
that
true
by
the
way
dad
dillon
requested
me
to
offer
you
her
apology
it
seems
she
has
just
learned
that
her
husband
did
insure
the
pearl
necklace
with
the
reliance
company
he
neglected
to
tell
her
about
it
oh
i
see
nichols
commented
dryly
well
i
talk
with
her
tomorrow
penny
had
finished
picking
the
bouquet
of
flowers
and
was
walking
toward
the
house
when
the
detective
called
her
back
just
a
minute
i
learned
something
today
which
may
interest
you
penny
halted
waiting
expectantly
it
about
that
new
friend
of
yours
amy
coulter
penny
inquired
eagerly
yes
the
police
have
traced
her
to
that
new
rooming
house
where
you
tell
me
she
staying
she
probably
be
arrested
sometime
tonight
oh
dad
amy
has
done
nothing
wrong
why
ca
the
police
leave
her
alone
it
strikes
me
they
are
making
a
mistake
in
this
case
of
course
they
are
oh
dad
ca
i
warn
amy
it
probably
too
late
now
perhaps
not
let
me
try
at
least
nichols
had
anticipated
such
a
request
he
did
not
believe
in
assisting
a
fugitive
from
justice
yet
unknown
to
penny
he
had
investigated
amy
coulter
and
was
inclined
to
feel
that
she
was
innocent
of
the
charge
against
her
all
right
if
you
like
he
assented
but
if
you
see
that
the
house
is
watched
have
the
good
sense
not
to
go
in
i
be
careful
penny
promised
tell
gallup
not
to
wait
dinner
for
me
nichols
opened
the
garage
doors
for
her
and
closed
them
again
after
she
had
backed
the
car
to
the
street
penny
parked
a
half
block
from
amy
coulter
rooming
house
she
walked
slowly
past
the
place
carefully
glancing
about
no
one
was
in
sight
and
she
doubted
that
the
building
was
being
watched
entering
she
ran
up
the
stairway
to
her
friend
room
rapping
sharply
on
the
door
who
is
there
amy
asked
it
i
penny
let
me
in
instantly
the
door
was
flung
open
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
the
police
amy
confessed
laughing
nervously
that
why
i
came
penny
informed
closing
the
door
behind
her
they
have
traced
you
here
the
police
yes
you
must
leave
at
once
but
where
can
i
go
i
have
no
friends
and
very
little
money
it
occurred
to
penny
to
mention
that
she
had
seen
amy
accept
payment
from
the
museum
workman
hoges
but
she
refrained
from
doing
so
instead
she
examined
the
contents
of
her
purse
i
ca
take
money
from
you
amy
said
but
you
need
it
i
have
enough
to
keep
me
for
a
few
days
but
i
do
know
where
to
go
you
must
find
a
new
rooming
house
i
help
you
pack
but
i
ca
leave
tonight
amy
protested
weakly
you
must
unless
you
do
the
police
will
surely
catch
you
it
after
six
how
can
i
get
my
trunk
moved
you
must
abandon
your
trunk
penny
advised
i
help
you
pack
your
bags
amy
gazed
disconsolately
about
the
room
at
the
many
art
objects
and
trinkets
that
she
loved
after
the
trouble
blows
over
you
can
come
back
for
your
things
penny
said
but
will
it
ever
clear
up
amy
asked
hopelessly
it
might
be
better
to
stay
and
face
it
if
you
can
prove
your
innocence
i
ca
prove
anything
amy
responded
no
you
right
i
must
remain
in
hiding
until
the
thief
is
captured
penny
had
begun
to
gather
up
clothing
where
are
your
bags
she
asked
there
no
time
to
lose
under
the
bed
amy
answered
she
ran
to
the
closet
and
jerked
her
dresses
from
the
hangers
penny
crossed
the
room
to
pick
up
a
sweater
which
had
been
tossed
into
a
chair
as
she
moved
past
the
table
which
amy
used
as
a
writing
desk
she
noticed
a
stamped
sealed
envelope
lying
there
unintentionally
penny
glanced
at
the
name
and
address
it
read
george
hoges
general
delivery
belton
city
for
a
moment
penny
stared
at
the
letter
the
scene
which
she
had
witnessed
in
the
park
came
back
to
her
why
should
amy
and
the
worker
have
business
together
the
next
instant
she
was
heartily
ashamed
of
her
suspicion
yet
she
could
not
let
the
matter
pass
without
speaking
of
it
amy
she
called
yes
the
girl
emerged
from
the
closet
with
a
pile
of
dresses
in
her
arms
i
do
mean
to
be
prying
penny
said
awkwardly
but
i
could
help
seeing
this
letter
a
faint
flush
crept
over
amy
face
she
questioned
defiantly
what
about
it
nothing
penny
answered
shortly
if
amy
did
not
feel
like
explaining
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
in
silence
the
girls
continued
their
packing
presently
amy
picked
up
the
letter
and
thrust
it
into
her
pocketbook
i
guess
i
ready
she
announced
they
each
took
a
bag
and
started
down
the
stairway
but
as
they
reached
the
lower
landing
penny
abruptly
halted
warning
her
companion
to
keep
back
what
is
it
amy
whispered
penny
indicated
a
man
who
was
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
loitering
in
the
doorway
of
a
bakery
shop
a
detective
from
police
headquarters
i
seen
him
at
the
station
hastily
the
girls
retreated
back
up
the
stairs
to
the
bedroom
amy
flung
herself
into
a
chair
it
useless
trying
to
escape
she
murmured
i
may
as
well
give
myself
up
penny
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
bedroom
opened
over
an
alley
and
she
was
elated
to
see
that
it
had
a
fire
escape
no
one
was
in
sight
you
still
have
a
chance
amy
she
urged
but
you
must
hurry
thank
you
for
everything
you
have
done
to
help
me
the
girl
murmured
gratefully
moving
to
the
window
which
penny
had
opened
for
her
never
forget
it
i
done
nothing
penny
replied
assisting
her
to
climb
over
the
sill
can
you
manage
both
bags
yes
i
think
so
will
you
let
me
know
the
address
of
your
new
rooming
house
amy
yes
of
course
i
have
no
idea
now
where
i
go
i
may
not
escape
at
all
keep
to
the
alley
penny
advised
and
good
luck
she
stood
watching
from
the
window
while
amy
descended
the
fire
escape
to
enter
the
alley
the
girl
waved
her
hand
reassuringly
and
vanished
penny
closed
the
window
and
straightened
up
the
room
so
that
there
would
be
no
appearance
of
sudden
flight
she
wondered
if
she
had
done
right
to
help
amy
escape
the
police
she
felt
troubled
because
the
girl
had
failed
to
explain
why
she
had
written
to
hoges
yet
the
letter
provided
penny
with
a
valuable
clue
undoubtedly
the
man
told
amy
to
address
him
in
care
of
general
delivery
she
thought
that
means
he
call
there
for
his
mail
if
i
keep
watch
i
may
locate
him
since
the
day
penny
had
encountered
the
museum
workman
at
the
gage
galleries
she
had
held
to
the
theory
that
the
man
had
something
to
do
with
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
priceless
rembrandt
it
had
been
her
firm
belief
that
if
she
apprehended
hoges
for
questioning
the
establishment
of
his
own
guilt
would
result
in
amy
exoneration
but
now
that
she
had
learned
the
two
were
friends
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
certainly
amy
association
with
the
man
did
not
tend
to
point
to
her
own
innocence
i
not
help
the
girl
again
unless
she
reveals
everything
concerning
her
connection
with
hoges
penny
decided
from
now
on
matters
must
take
their
own
course
leaving
the
bedroom
she
went
downstairs
and
out
the
front
door
the
watchful
detective
was
still
stationed
across
the
street
but
penny
was
so
engrossed
in
her
own
thoughts
that
she
cast
only
a
casual
glance
in
his
direction
she
had
walked
a
short
distance
down
the
street
when
she
felt
a
firm
pressure
on
her
arm
just
a
minute
young
lady
penny
whirled
around
to
find
herself
face
to
face
with
the
police
detective
chapter
xvi
watchful
waiting
what
do
you
want
penny
gasped
she
felt
certain
the
man
intended
to
arrest
her
for
aiding
amy
coulter
to
escape
the
detective
stared
down
at
her
face
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
when
you
came
out
of
that
rooming
house
i
mistook
you
for
another
he
released
his
grip
on
her
arm
and
continued
to
offer
excuses
as
penny
walked
away
she
chuckled
to
herself
realizing
that
the
plainclothes
man
had
taken
her
for
amy
coulter
but
the
smile
quickly
left
her
face
for
she
did
not
feel
very
proud
of
the
trick
she
had
played
on
the
police
if
it
should
turn
out
that
the
girl
was
guilty
then
indeed
she
would
be
sorry
dinner
was
over
when
penny
reached
home
and
gallup
reported
that
nichols
had
returned
to
his
office
to
work
on
a
case
your
food
is
in
the
oven
penny
she
told
the
girl
a
trifle
irritably
i
declare
i
ca
see
why
you
had
to
run
off
just
when
i
was
setting
things
on
the
table
your
father
is
the
same
way
we
a
dreadful
pair
penny
agreed
amiably
as
she
dished
herself
up
a
generous
helping
of
meat
and
potatoes
any
gravy
mrs
gallup
no
your
father
ate
it
all
and
i
do
feel
like
making
any
more
of
course
not
i
have
a
big
plate
of
food
now
just
leave
that
pan
of
dishes
gallup
and
i
do
them
for
you
the
housekeeper
immediately
softened
you
may
wipe
them
if
you
like
she
said
i
am
tired
tonight
i
do
mean
to
be
cross
only
annoying
to
have
folks
late
for
meals
i
like
food
to
be
eaten
when
it
good
and
hot
you
a
dear
penny
laughed
giving
her
a
squeeze
i
try
not
be
late
again
after
the
dishes
were
stacked
in
the
cupboard
penny
spent
a
half
hour
reading
then
she
went
to
bed
although
it
was
only
a
little
after
eight
she
could
not
remember
when
she
had
been
so
tired
you
not
sick
gallup
inquired
anxiously
for
usually
penny
was
the
last
one
in
the
house
to
retire
no
i
all
right
just
sleepy
penny
might
have
added
that
she
was
likewise
blue
and
discouraged
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
made
no
progress
at
all
in
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
which
surrounded
amy
coulter
as
she
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
penny
attention
was
attracted
by
someone
standing
by
the
garage
door
she
paused
thinking
that
it
might
be
her
father
to
her
astonishment
the
man
darted
back
behind
a
group
of
tall
bushes
which
banked
the
building
penny
snapped
out
the
light
and
watched
the
man
did
not
reappear
what
are
you
doing
gallup
questioned
i
think
someone
is
watching
the
house
i
just
saw
a
man
by
the
garage
oh
i
call
the
police
no
wait
penny
commanded
i
may
have
been
mistaken
she
said
it
to
reassure
the
housekeeper
gallup
came
to
the
window
and
peered
out
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
about
the
grounds
i
take
a
flashlight
and
investigate
penny
proposed
gallup
caught
her
firmly
by
the
arm
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
we
lock
all
the
doors
and
not
stir
from
the
house
until
your
father
returns
the
housekeeper
insisted
upon
drawing
all
the
blinds
and
fastening
the
doors
and
windows
it
seemed
an
unnecessary
precaution
to
penny
who
believed
that
the
prowler
had
gone
an
hour
slipped
by
and
the
man
was
not
seen
again
penny
went
wearily
to
bed
but
gallup
was
so
nervous
that
she
declared
her
intention
of
remaining
up
until
nichols
arrived
home
the
detective
drove
in
shortly
after
ten
and
penny
could
hear
the
two
talking
in
the
living
room
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
before
her
father
came
upstairs
in
the
morning
penny
awoke
feeling
refreshed
and
cheerful
again
after
breakfast
she
walked
to
the
post
office
stationing
herself
near
the
general
delivery
window
for
an
hour
she
watched
men
and
women
come
and
go
claiming
their
mail
at
the
little
window
george
hoges
did
not
appear
but
penny
had
scarcely
dared
to
hope
that
he
would
come
so
soon
presently
she
walked
over
to
the
window
and
questioned
the
clerk
who
was
in
charge
can
you
tell
me
if
a
man
by
the
name
of
george
hoges
gets
his
mail
here
the
clerk
thumbed
through
a
stack
of
letters
before
answering
i
do
remember
the
man
but
he
probably
call
here
sooner
or
later
for
he
has
two
letters
penny
retreated
to
her
post
near
the
door
it
was
tedious
waiting
when
i
get
to
be
a
taxpayer
i
vote
for
chairs
in
every
post
office
she
thought
penny
spent
nearly
the
entire
day
waiting
for
george
hoges
to
appear
by
nightfall
she
was
so
weary
she
could
scarcely
stumble
home
she
felt
certain
she
would
not
have
the
fortitude
to
resume
her
watch
the
following
day
nichols
was
amused
when
she
told
him
of
her
unpleasant
experience
a
detective
must
learn
to
spend
half
of
his
time
just
waiting
he
declared
why
i
handled
cases
where
we
assign
men
to
watch
a
certain
street
corner
perhaps
they
be
required
to
keep
it
up
for
six
months
that
a
long
time
not
if
the
man
you
after
comes
along
in
the
end
if
i
keep
up
my
vigil
even
six
days
i
have
corns
on
the
bottom
of
my
feet
penny
sighed
everything
considered
i
do
believe
cut
out
to
be
a
lady
detective
however
the
following
day
found
her
again
at
her
station
in
the
post
office
the
task
of
waiting
and
watching
seemed
even
more
tiresome
than
before
when
she
came
home
late
in
the
afternoon
gallup
offered
scant
sympathy
i
never
heard
of
such
a
silly
thing
she
declared
standing
all
day
in
the
post
office
i
do
know
why
your
father
permits
you
to
play
around
at
being
a
detective
if
you
think
it
play
just
try
standing
in
one
spot
for
eight
hours
penny
said
indignantly
i
have
better
sense
gallup
retorted
then
she
softened
i
know
you
tired
penny
sit
down
and
rest
while
i
make
you
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
with
a
blissful
sigh
penny
sank
into
an
upholstered
chair
she
was
looking
at
a
magazine
when
the
housekeeper
returned
with
a
pot
of
chocolate
here
is
a
letter
for
you
she
mentioned
dropping
it
into
the
lap
it
came
this
afternoon
noticing
that
it
was
postmarked
belton
city
penny
quickly
tore
it
open
the
envelope
contained
a
brief
note
from
amy
coulter
who
had
written
to
give
her
new
address
for
a
long
time
after
she
had
finished
reading
the
message
penny
sat
staring
down
at
it
without
being
aware
of
her
preoccupation
i
hope
it
is
bad
news
gallup
said
anxiously
oh
no
penny
folded
the
message
and
thrust
it
into
her
pocket
i
was
only
thinking
her
thoughts
had
not
been
pleasant
she
still
liked
amy
coulter
despite
the
girl
strange
actions
yet
she
felt
that
she
could
not
continue
to
help
her
without
positive
proof
of
her
innocence
if
only
amy
had
explained
her
connection
with
george
hoges
you
have
been
a
bit
like
your
usual
self
penny
gallup
said
severely
you
not
sick
are
you
of
course
not
i
just
tired
you
had
too
much
excitement
lately
it
seems
to
me
this
household
is
always
in
turmoil
the
past
week
all
i
heard
of
is
robberies
prowlers
and
more
robberies
at
least
we
had
no
murder
yet
penny
chuckled
by
the
way
what
did
dad
say
last
night
when
you
told
him
about
the
man
we
saw
hiding
behind
the
garage
he
thought
probably
it
was
some
crank
but
i
noticed
he
examined
the
ground
for
footprints
perhaps
the
prowler
was
the
same
person
who
broke
into
dad
office
penny
remarked
only
that
does
seem
reasonable
either
for
what
could
anyone
be
after
here
at
the
house
silverware
or
possibly
some
of
your
father
papers
he
does
keep
anything
of
great
value
here
as
far
as
i
know
before
gallup
could
make
a
response
the
telephone
rang
and
she
went
to
answer
it
can
you
come
penny
she
called
a
moment
later
it
for
you
the
girl
hurried
to
the
adjoining
room
and
was
surprised
as
she
took
the
receiver
to
hear
dillon
voice
the
woman
was
greatly
agitated
miss
nichols
you
were
right
about
the
picture
she
began
abruptly
i
communicated
with
the
museum
authorities
as
i
promised
and
they
told
me
that
the
painting
is
a
fake
i
thought
it
would
turn
out
that
way
penny
commented
in
satisfaction
i
ca
understand
how
i
was
duped
dillon
went
on
excitedly
i
was
so
careful
i
been
cheated
out
of
four
thousand
dollars
four
thousand
penny
exclaimed
why
yesterday
you
told
me
you
had
paid
only
half
that
sum
since
then
i
made
the
final
payment
but
i
warned
you
dillon
penny
cried
in
exasperation
why
did
you
do
it
because
i
could
help
myself
the
woman
wailed
my
friend
the
agent
convinced
me
that
if
i
did
complete
the
payments
i
would
get
into
serious
trouble
with
the
police
that
we
both
would
be
disgraced
and
you
believed
his
story
he
only
cheated
you
no
he
would
do
that
dillon
replied
firmly
this
gentleman
reputation
is
above
reproach
he
could
have
known
any
more
than
i
did
that
the
rembrandt
was
a
fake
the
only
thing
for
you
to
do
now
is
to
reveal
everything
penny
urged
tell
me
the
name
of
this
man
no
i
ca
i
have
promised
to
keep
silent
dillon
i
am
unable
to
understand
your
attitude
do
you
want
to
help
capture
the
persons
who
tricked
you
yes
i
do
anything
i
can
except
reveal
this
gentleman
identity
i
learn
from
him
the
name
of
the
firm
where
the
picture
was
bought
and
notify
the
police
penny
made
a
grimace
which
dillon
could
not
see
after
a
silence
she
asked
bluntly
is
it
hanley
cron
whom
you
are
protecting
certainly
not
dillon
retorted
and
hung
up
the
receiver
i
wonder
if
she
told
the
truth
penny
thought
turning
from
the
telephone
at
least
she
was
afraid
to
answer
any
more
questions
it
occurred
to
the
girl
that
if
hanley
cron
were
not
the
mysterious
agent
who
had
visited
dillon
the
previous
afternoon
then
the
caller
must
have
been
the
elderly
gentleman
with
the
black
leather
brief
case
recalling
that
she
still
had
the
license
number
of
the
man
car
penny
thought
that
it
might
be
well
to
show
it
to
her
father
and
ask
him
to
trace
the
owner
for
her
nichols
would
soon
be
coming
home
for
it
was
nearly
dinner
time
penny
searched
in
her
purse
but
the
notebook
was
not
there
gallup
have
you
seen
a
little
green
book
anywhere
in
the
house
she
inquired
anxiously
i
saw
it
in
your
room
this
morning
the
housekeeper
informed
i
think
it
was
on
the
dresser
oh
yes
i
remember
now
that
was
where
i
left
it
penny
laughed
in
relief
she
raced
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
forgetting
that
she
had
ever
been
tired
to
her
delight
the
little
book
was
lying
just
where
she
had
dropped
it
she
caught
it
up
rereading
the
notations
which
she
had
made
the
previous
day
hearing
her
father
car
on
the
driveway
she
slipped
the
notebook
into
her
pocket
and
turned
to
leave
as
she
crossed
to
the
door
her
eye
chanced
to
rove
toward
the
desk
she
stared
in
blank
amazement
the
black
imp
was
gone
chapter
xvii
private
keep
out
penny
cry
of
alarm
brought
gallup
hurrying
up
the
stairs
what
is
the
matter
the
housekeeper
asked
anxiously
the
black
imp
is
gone
penny
exclaimed
did
you
do
anything
with
it
why
no
it
was
on
the
desk
the
last
time
i
saw
it
it
is
there
now
someone
has
stolen
it
nonsense
gallup
said
impatiently
who
would
want
that
little
statue
if
a
thief
entered
the
house
he
would
take
things
of
greater
value
than
that
you
must
have
put
it
in
a
different
place
and
forgotten
about
it
oh
but
i
did
gallup
the
imp
was
on
the
desk
this
morning
when
i
left
the
house
well
i
not
seen
it
the
housekeeper
began
to
open
bureau
drawers
for
despite
penny
words
she
was
not
entirely
convinced
that
the
girl
had
left
the
statue
on
the
desk
penny
often
misplaced
cherished
possessions
only
to
spend
an
unhappy
hour
trying
to
recall
where
she
had
deposited
them
it
no
use
to
search
gallup
she
wailed
disconsolately
the
black
imp
is
gone
and
will
never
be
found
but
no
one
has
been
in
the
house
all
day
the
window
is
open
penny
observed
i
know
i
closed
it
this
morning
before
i
left
the
house
the
bedroom
overlooked
a
porch
against
which
stood
a
sturdy
rose
trellis
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
a
thief
to
reach
the
window
by
means
of
it
once
when
penny
had
found
herself
locked
out
of
the
house
she
had
tested
the
trellis
and
discovered
that
it
made
an
excellent
ladder
i
did
go
away
for
an
hour
this
afternoon
gallup
admitted
i
went
to
the
grocery
store
that
would
be
long
enough
for
a
thief
to
enter
the
house
but
i
sure
nothing
else
is
missing
gallup
maintained
it
does
seem
reasonable
that
anyone
would
steal
a
little
statue
an
unfinished
one
at
that
nichols
had
entered
the
house
by
the
rear
door
he
called
from
below
anyone
home
we
upstairs
penny
shouted
down
a
thief
has
been
in
the
house
the
detective
joined
the
two
in
the
bedroom
what
all
the
excitement
he
demanded
the
black
imp
has
been
stolen
penny
informed
it
seems
to
be
missing
gallup
corrected
but
i
ca
believe
anyone
would
want
that
lump
of
clay
nichols
did
not
reply
as
he
surveyed
the
room
nothing
appeared
to
be
out
of
place
he
noted
the
open
window
instantly
and
crossed
over
to
it
the
thief
entered
here
he
said
that
was
what
i
was
trying
to
tell
gallup
penny
cried
triumphantly
the
detective
picked
up
something
from
the
window
ledge
it
was
a
strand
of
gray
wool
which
had
caught
on
a
rough
board
he
then
stepped
out
on
the
top
of
the
porch
and
crossed
over
to
the
place
where
the
rose
trellis
projected
be
careful
gallup
warned
anxiously
as
she
saw
that
the
detective
intended
to
climb
down
the
fragile
wooden
framework
the
trellis
is
strong
enough
to
hold
a
man
much
heavier
than
myself
nichols
replied
and
i
see
the
thief
came
this
way
too
how
can
you
tell
penny
questioned
eagerly
the
rose
bush
has
been
broken
off
in
several
places
gallup
was
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
discovery
fearing
that
other
things
besides
the
black
imp
might
have
been
stolen
she
hastened
downstairs
to
make
a
thorough
search
penny
joined
her
father
outside
the
house
what
do
you
make
of
it
dad
she
inquired
why
did
the
thief
break
in
obviously
for
the
black
imp
but
who
would
be
interested
in
it
and
for
what
reason
i
ca
answer
that
one
penny
but
i
wondering
if
this
theft
could
have
anything
to
do
with
max
lynch
visit
to
my
office
he
appeared
frightened
when
he
saw
the
imp
on
your
desk
penny
recalled
yes
he
turned
and
fled
without
revealing
his
mission
and
directly
after
that
your
office
was
ransacked
yes
but
that
may
or
may
not
have
had
any
connection
then
i
noticed
a
man
prowling
about
the
house
penny
continued
he
must
have
been
the
one
who
stole
the
imp
you
were
able
to
furnish
a
very
good
description
of
the
man
no
i
caught
only
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
his
face
it
was
max
lynch
i
sure
it
was
dad
i
have
recognized
him
instantly
for
his
appearance
is
distinctive
nichols
bent
down
to
examine
a
footprint
in
the
soft
earth
beneath
the
rose
trellis
he
measured
it
with
his
hand
the
thief
must
wear
about
a
size
eleven
shoe
he
mentioned
and
a
gray
suit
of
excellent
quality
other
than
that
i
afraid
we
have
no
clues
why
should
anyone
want
my
copy
of
the
black
imp
penny
repeated
in
a
bewildered
tone
dad
you
do
suppose
hanley
cron
considered
it
his
property
and
dared
to
take
it
that
a
possibility
nichols
agreed
after
a
moment
of
thought
from
the
first
his
connection
with
the
imp
has
been
odd
to
say
the
least
i
have
a
talk
with
him
tomorrow
and
see
what
i
can
learn
when
penny
and
her
father
entered
the
house
gallup
was
still
searching
the
lower
floor
anything
more
missing
the
detective
asked
not
that
i
can
discover
the
silver
is
all
here
apparently
only
the
black
imp
was
taken
nichols
said
musingly
that
little
figure
must
guard
some
important
secret
i
never
dreamed
it
could
be
valuable
penny
said
i
liked
it
only
because
it
was
a
copy
of
amy
statue
i
thought
the
work
rather
crude
i
doubt
that
the
figure
has
any
intrinsic
value
nichols
answered
slowly
but
for
some
unknown
reason
it
highly
important
to
the
man
who
stole
it
that
evening
penny
accompanied
her
chum
susan
to
a
moving
picture
show
but
although
the
bill
was
an
exceptionally
good
one
she
found
it
difficult
to
center
her
attention
upon
the
screen
she
kept
thinking
of
the
black
imp
and
wishing
that
she
could
recover
it
or
at
least
solve
the
mystery
of
its
strange
disappearance
i
afraid
i
just
have
to
forget
it
she
thought
gloomily
but
at
least
i
making
a
little
headway
in
tracing
the
persons
who
may
know
something
about
the
stolen
rembrandt
penny
was
convinced
that
if
only
she
could
maintain
a
patient
vigil
at
the
post
office
in
time
the
worker
would
appear
there
for
his
mail
the
next
morning
found
her
at
her
usual
station
determined
not
to
become
discouraged
by
failure
for
three
long
hours
she
kept
faithful
watch
of
the
general
delivery
window
a
great
many
persons
came
and
went
but
no
one
who
remotely
resembled
hoges
penny
became
aware
of
a
growing
hunger
although
it
was
not
yet
noon
she
noticed
a
restaurant
directly
across
the
street
i
slip
over
there
and
have
a
sandwich
she
decided
it
will
only
take
a
minute
the
restaurant
was
crowded
it
was
impossible
for
penny
to
find
a
table
near
the
window
she
was
forced
to
sit
at
the
rear
of
the
room
and
other
diners
blocked
her
view
of
the
street
she
hastily
ate
her
sandwich
and
returned
to
the
post
office
scarcely
had
she
taken
her
position
near
the
door
when
the
clerk
at
the
general
delivery
window
signalled
her
were
you
the
girl
who
wanted
to
see
george
hoges
yes
i
am
he
just
called
for
his
mail
a
few
minutes
ago
penny
heart
sank
after
waiting
nearly
two
days
she
had
missed
the
man
and
it
was
entirely
her
own
fault
you
did
see
which
direction
he
went
no
i
did
the
clerk
answered
but
he
left
only
a
minute
or
so
before
you
came
in
then
maybe
i
can
still
catch
him
penny
said
hopefully
she
ran
from
the
building
pausing
on
the
outside
steps
to
survey
the
street
a
man
who
from
a
distance
resembled
the
worker
was
just
turning
the
corner
i
believe
it
mr
hoges
she
thought
excitedly
penny
raced
to
the
corner
the
man
was
only
a
little
ways
ahead
and
as
he
paused
for
an
instant
to
glance
into
a
shop
window
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
it
was
george
hoges
penny
original
intention
had
been
to
question
the
man
but
now
she
slightly
altered
her
plan
she
would
follow
him
the
worker
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
with
penny
in
close
pursuit
however
she
took
care
not
to
draw
too
near
fearing
that
he
might
glance
back
and
recognize
her
at
first
hoges
kept
to
the
main
streets
but
presently
he
turned
toward
a
section
which
was
somewhat
deserted
penny
was
forced
to
drop
farther
behind
they
came
soon
to
a
factory
district
with
many
vacant
buildings
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
franklyn
street
section
hoges
halted
in
front
of
an
old
building
and
disappeared
inside
when
penny
drew
near
a
minute
later
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
office
directory
was
of
no
use
for
not
a
single
listed
name
was
familiar
to
the
girl
however
penny
had
a
suspicion
that
the
man
she
sought
might
have
engaged
the
top
floor
of
the
building
she
was
thinking
of
mounting
the
stairs
when
the
janitor
appeared
looking
for
someone
he
inquired
yes
but
i
do
know
his
name
penny
replied
he
is
an
artist
i
think
the
top
floor
is
rented
to
a
firm
of
commercial
artists
the
man
informed
that
must
be
the
place
i
looking
for
thank
you
penny
slowly
mounted
four
long
flights
of
stairs
pausing
at
the
top
landing
to
regain
her
breath
she
observed
with
keen
interest
that
several
doors
opened
off
the
hallway
and
each
bore
a
freshly
lettered
sign
private
keep
out
penny
glanced
down
the
stairs
to
make
certain
that
the
janitor
had
not
followed
her
then
she
tiptoed
along
the
hall
pausing
by
the
first
door
to
listen
she
could
hear
an
indistinct
murmur
of
voices
now
and
then
she
caught
a
few
words
the
girl
sent
it
back
she
overheard
and
then
a
moment
later
we
have
to
find
someone
to
do
her
work
she
may
take
it
into
her
silly
head
to
squeal
too
could
the
men
be
speaking
of
amy
coulter
penny
felt
sure
that
the
letter
hoges
had
received
at
general
delivery
had
come
from
her
a
loud
creaking
sound
from
the
direction
of
the
stairway
caused
penny
to
straighten
up
and
listen
intently
someone
was
coming
while
it
might
be
only
the
janitor
she
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
frantically
she
glanced
about
for
a
hiding
place
at
the
end
of
the
hall
a
broom
closet
stood
with
door
slightly
ajar
she
darted
to
it
and
shut
herself
inside
leaving
a
wide
crack
through
which
she
could
look
out
the
corridor
was
dark
at
first
she
could
not
see
the
newcomer
very
plainly
she
distinguished
only
a
tall
shadowy
form
however
as
he
paused
at
the
very
door
where
penny
had
stood
listening
only
a
moment
before
she
caught
an
excellent
glimpse
of
his
face
she
saw
then
with
a
start
of
recognition
that
it
was
hanley
cron
chapter
xviii
captured
the
art
critic
rapped
three
times
on
the
door
it
opened
instantly
and
closed
after
him
as
he
vanished
inside
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
penny
tiptoed
back
down
the
hall
her
suspicions
had
been
aroused
and
she
was
determined
to
learn
what
was
going
on
inside
the
room
she
paused
at
the
door
and
listened
again
she
could
hear
voices
but
this
time
it
was
impossible
to
catch
even
a
word
penny
moved
on
to
the
next
door
she
gently
turned
the
knob
the
door
was
locked
so
were
all
the
others
along
the
corridor
until
she
came
to
the
last
one
to
penny
surprise
it
opened
cautiously
she
peeped
inside
the
room
appeared
to
be
empty
she
entered
it
was
only
a
small
office
empty
of
furniture
a
few
papers
were
scattered
over
the
bare
floor
but
upon
examination
penny
found
them
of
no
significance
it
was
clear
that
if
she
were
to
learn
anything
of
value
she
must
find
a
means
of
entering
the
room
where
hanley
cron
the
worker
and
the
others
were
talking
an
inside
door
opened
into
an
adjoining
room
penny
was
elated
to
find
it
unlocked
but
her
satisfaction
was
of
short
duration
for
the
next
office
likewise
was
empty
and
devoid
of
any
clues
by
placing
her
ear
against
the
north
wall
she
was
able
to
hear
the
three
men
talking
it
was
provoking
to
be
so
close
and
yet
unable
to
learn
what
they
were
saying
she
felt
convinced
that
if
only
she
could
hear
their
conversation
a
great
many
puzzling
matters
might
be
cleared
up
presently
penny
heard
a
door
slam
she
peeped
out
into
the
hallway
in
time
to
see
cron
hoges
and
another
man
disappearing
down
the
stairway
the
coast
is
clear
now
she
thought
if
i
can
just
find
some
way
to
enter
that
room
while
they
away
she
made
another
tour
of
the
hall
trying
the
door
as
she
had
anticipated
it
was
locked
returning
to
the
room
she
had
just
left
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
a
wide
ledge
of
stone
extended
along
the
wall
of
the
building
connecting
the
windows
at
best
it
offered
a
dangerous
footing
yet
penny
was
tempted
to
try
to
reach
the
adjoining
room
by
means
of
it
for
there
was
no
other
way
to
gain
admittance
she
raised
the
window
and
looked
down
her
courage
nearly
failed
her
while
the
ledge
was
wide
it
meant
a
long
fall
and
instant
death
should
she
become
dizzy
and
lose
her
balance
i
can
do
it
easy
penny
told
herself
grimly
climbing
out
on
the
ledge
she
clutched
an
overhanging
telephone
wire
for
support
and
cautiously
eased
herself
along
an
inch
at
a
time
she
kept
her
gaze
ahead
resisting
the
temptation
to
glance
toward
the
deserted
street
she
reached
the
next
window
which
was
open
an
inch
at
the
bottom
the
gap
provided
a
and
enabled
her
to
raise
the
window
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
she
dropped
lightly
to
the
floor
she
found
herself
in
a
large
studio
room
well
illuminated
by
two
sky
lights
obviously
several
artists
had
been
working
there
for
the
place
was
cluttered
with
easels
palettes
and
discarded
paintings
a
number
of
pictures
of
uniform
size
stood
in
a
little
pile
face
downward
curiously
penny
lifted
one
to
gaze
at
it
the
stolen
rembrandt
she
gasped
then
she
knew
better
it
was
only
a
copy
identical
with
the
one
she
had
viewed
at
dillon
home
she
lifted
the
other
pictures
and
looked
at
them
they
were
all
the
same
so
this
is
where
dillon
fake
came
from
she
thought
the
men
who
rented
this
place
apparently
are
manufacturing
rembrandts
in
wholesale
quantities
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
noticed
a
picture
which
was
only
half
finished
and
beside
it
a
canvas
covered
easel
she
crossed
over
to
lift
the
protecting
cloth
still
another
rembrandt
was
revealed
just
a
copy
penny
told
herself
and
started
to
replace
the
canvas
then
she
looked
at
the
picture
again
it
did
not
look
exactly
like
the
others
the
detail
was
the
same
yet
this
painting
seemed
to
have
a
depth
and
quality
which
the
others
lacked
penny
wondered
if
it
could
be
the
original
rembrandt
the
priceless
painting
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
gage
galleries
i
believe
it
is
she
decided
as
penny
stood
gazing
at
the
picture
she
was
dismayed
to
hear
footsteps
in
the
hallway
frantically
she
looked
about
for
a
hiding
place
it
was
too
late
to
escape
through
the
window
the
only
refuge
available
was
a
clothes
closet
penny
darted
inside
and
softly
shut
the
door
scarcely
had
she
secreted
herself
when
three
men
entered
the
room
peering
out
through
the
keyhole
she
distinguished
cron
hoges
and
the
man
in
gray
whom
she
had
once
followed
to
the
franklyn
street
address
apparently
the
men
had
returned
for
something
they
had
forgotten
hanley
cron
searched
in
a
table
drawer
say
who
left
that
window
open
he
demanded
unexpectedly
i
did
hoges
said
you
ca
blame
me
for
it
the
other
man
growled
probably
you
opened
it
yourself
i
did
not
cron
retorted
he
crossed
the
room
and
slammed
down
the
window
be
careful
about
things
like
that
if
we
not
more
cautious
we
have
the
cops
on
us
if
you
ask
me
i
think
it
about
time
we
blow
hoges
commented
this
town
is
getting
pretty
hot
for
us
maybe
you
right
cron
muttered
i
had
a
disagreeable
hour
with
that
simple
minded
dillon
she
still
afraid
to
notify
the
police
but
that
nichols
girl
has
been
talking
with
her
and
she
may
make
us
trouble
christopher
nichols
has
been
assigned
to
the
jewel
case
too
hoges
added
he
no
sloth
when
it
comes
to
action
our
game
has
just
about
played
out
cron
agreed
but
i
have
one
more
good
customer
lined
up
i
told
him
to
come
here
at
to
see
the
picture
maybe
we
could
pull
this
last
job
hoges
agreed
does
he
know
much
about
painting
very
little
we
ought
to
nip
him
for
three
thousand
at
least
hoges
glanced
at
his
watch
if
your
customer
is
coming
at
we
better
get
the
stage
set
all
right
cron
nodded
let
clean
up
the
joint
uncovering
the
genuine
rembrandt
he
took
one
of
the
copies
and
deftly
inserted
it
in
the
picture
frame
behind
the
original
painting
but
in
such
a
manner
that
only
the
back
of
the
canvas
was
visible
when
the
frame
was
replaced
only
a
person
with
keen
eyesight
could
detect
the
trickery
we
pull
the
usual
gag
about
identifying
the
picture
with
a
signature
or
a
symbol
cron
muttered
that
always
goes
big
by
this
time
penny
had
seen
enough
to
understand
how
dillon
and
other
gullible
customers
had
been
duped
they
had
been
shown
the
original
stolen
rembrandt
but
when
invited
to
place
an
identifying
mark
on
the
back
of
the
canvas
to
insure
that
they
received
the
same
picture
actually
signed
the
fake
copy
it
was
then
a
simple
matter
to
remove
the
two
paintings
from
the
frame
and
send
the
customer
the
worthless
one
which
bore
his
mark
cron
and
his
confederates
have
worked
a
fairly
safe
racket
too
penny
thought
even
if
a
customer
learns
he
has
been
cheated
he
afraid
to
go
to
the
police
for
fear
he
expose
himself
as
a
person
willing
to
buy
stolen
property
she
was
not
greatly
surprised
to
learn
that
cron
was
a
party
to
the
dishonest
scheme
notwithstanding
that
dillon
had
denied
the
art
critic
was
the
mysterious
agent
who
had
visited
her
now
penny
knew
that
the
woman
had
not
spoken
the
truth
doubtlessly
she
had
feared
to
accuse
cron
lest
he
in
turn
expose
her
to
the
police
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
cron
and
his
confederates
froze
into
tense
attitudes
then
relaxed
it
must
be
our
customer
cron
whispered
open
the
door
as
it
swung
back
max
lynch
stepped
into
the
room
he
smiled
blandly
hello
boys
you
do
look
as
if
you
were
expecting
me
we
were
exactly
cron
muttered
what
do
you
want
max
you
know
i
warned
you
not
to
come
here
the
gambler
had
been
making
a
quick
survey
of
the
room
his
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
rembrandt
he
smiled
again
unpleasantly
say
who
are
you
anyway
hoges
demanded
angrily
what
business
do
you
have
with
us
my
business
is
with
your
pal
hanley
cron
we
partners
partners
hoges
echoed
his
eyes
narrowing
he
wheeled
toward
cron
if
you
been
double
crossing
me
oh
calm
down
cron
said
sharply
lynch
and
i
had
a
little
private
business
together
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
picture
racket
i
not
so
sure
about
that
the
other
retorted
you
been
collecting
all
the
money
maybe
you
stuck
some
of
it
into
your
pocket
i
did
come
here
to
start
an
argument
lynch
interposed
but
not
stand
for
any
monkey
business
either
hand
over
the
pearls
cron
i
do
have
them
i
told
you
once
that
girl
yes
you
told
me
a
good
many
things
cron
but
i
happen
to
know
you
have
the
necklace
hand
it
over
or
the
threat
was
left
unsaid
for
at
that
unfortunate
moment
penny
felt
an
overpowering
impulse
to
sneeze
she
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
but
succeeded
in
only
partially
muffling
the
sound
immediately
the
closet
door
was
flung
open
and
she
was
found
cowering
there
cron
dragged
her
from
her
hiding
place
so
you
been
listening
he
sneered
yes
said
penny
boldly
and
i
heard
enough
to
confirm
what
always
believed
you
are
the
person
who
stole
the
rembrandt
from
the
gage
galleries
you
a
cheap
trickster
who
pawns
himself
off
as
a
gentleman
as
she
uttered
the
tirade
the
girl
made
a
quick
dive
for
the
door
but
max
lynch
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
flung
her
back
not
so
fast
miss
nichols
he
muttered
this
is
once
when
you
go
tattling
to
the
police
or
to
that
father
of
yours
the
discovery
of
penny
hiding
in
the
closet
had
brought
an
abrupt
end
to
the
quarrel
in
the
face
of
the
new
emergency
the
four
crooks
laid
differences
aside
to
consider
what
must
be
done
tie
her
up
cron
ordered
harshly
penny
arms
and
legs
were
securely
bound
with
stout
cord
a
gag
was
drawn
over
her
mouth
and
she
was
unceremoniously
thrown
back
into
the
closet
but
she
could
still
hear
the
men
talking
this
changes
all
our
plans
cron
said
if
this
girl
knew
enough
to
follow
us
here
the
police
may
soon
be
on
our
trail
we
must
get
out
of
town
not
without
dividing
on
that
necklace
job
we
planned
together
lynch
interposed
angrily
you
never
leave
town
until
you
cough
up
hoges
and
his
unnamed
companion
were
regarding
cron
with
open
suspicion
you
been
holding
out
on
us
they
accused
the
art
critic
cron
realized
that
he
had
placed
himself
in
an
awkward
position
all
right
i
admit
i
have
the
pearl
necklace
he
said
shortly
we
split
four
ways
and
then
no
one
can
kick
max
lynch
did
not
like
the
decision
but
after
grumbling
a
little
he
unwillingly
agreed
now
let
get
out
of
here
cron
urged
nervously
the
necklace
is
at
my
room
we
have
to
go
there
what
about
the
rembrandt
hoges
asked
turning
to
look
at
it
take
my
advice
and
leave
it
behind
lynch
spoke
up
that
picture
is
as
hot
as
a
rivet
it
a
bulky
thing
to
tote
around
the
country
as
luggage
too
how
about
the
girl
hoges
demanded
cron
hesitated
only
a
fraction
of
an
instant
leave
her
in
the
closet
maybe
she
wo
be
found
very
soon
lynch
remarked
that
her
hard
luck
cron
retorted
we
have
to
look
out
for
ourselves
okay
lynch
agreed
indifferently
let
go
the
men
hastily
gathered
up
a
few
possessions
which
if
left
behind
might
serve
to
identify
them
then
they
went
out
the
door
locking
it
after
them
penny
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
her
heart
sank
with
a
gag
over
her
mouth
she
could
not
even
call
for
help
she
was
indeed
in
a
desperate
plight
chapter
xix
fire
penny
worked
at
her
bonds
but
the
cords
had
been
fastened
securely
and
she
could
not
free
herself
exhausted
she
lay
quiet
trying
to
think
of
some
way
to
attract
attention
she
thumped
with
her
feet
on
the
floor
of
the
closet
but
minutes
passed
and
no
one
came
to
her
assistance
it
was
useless
she
thought
miserably
there
was
scant
chance
that
anyone
would
discover
her
until
it
was
too
late
how
maddening
it
was
to
know
that
while
she
remained
helpless
cron
and
his
confederates
were
escaping
from
the
city
now
that
the
knowledge
was
valueless
to
her
she
comprehended
the
entire
plot
cron
and
hoges
had
worked
together
and
the
latter
had
smuggled
the
genuine
rembrandt
from
the
gage
galleries
just
as
she
had
suspected
then
instead
of
trying
to
sell
the
stolen
picture
they
made
copies
of
it
disposing
of
the
duplicate
many
times
and
at
a
handsome
profit
penny
was
not
certain
as
to
max
lynch
connection
with
the
men
but
mention
of
the
pearls
suggested
to
her
that
cron
and
the
gambler
had
relieved
dillon
of
her
necklace
she
recalled
that
the
art
critic
had
made
a
point
of
learning
the
exact
hour
when
the
woman
would
carry
the
pearls
to
the
bank
vault
was
it
not
likely
that
he
had
proposed
the
meeting
solely
as
a
means
of
providing
an
opportunity
for
the
robbery
when
penny
considered
amy
coulter
part
in
the
affair
she
was
without
a
theory
she
wondered
if
she
would
ever
know
whether
or
not
the
girl
was
involved
with
the
gang
presently
penny
became
aware
of
a
crackling
noise
in
the
building
at
first
she
paid
it
slight
heed
but
as
the
strange
sound
became
louder
she
listened
intently
she
could
hear
timbers
snapping
and
cracking
and
the
interior
of
the
closet
was
growing
uncomfortably
warm
even
then
the
horrible
truth
did
not
dawn
upon
her
she
heard
excited
shouts
and
running
footsteps
suddenly
penny
distinguished
a
cry
which
struck
terror
to
her
heart
fire
fire
she
was
momentarily
stunned
then
realizing
that
she
was
trapped
in
a
burning
building
she
struggled
desperately
to
free
herself
she
kicked
with
all
her
strength
against
the
floor
and
walls
of
the
closet
finally
she
succeeded
in
loosening
her
gag
help
help
she
screamed
her
voice
sounded
muffled
and
weak
the
top
floor
was
without
tenants
and
penny
knew
that
the
chance
of
anyone
hearing
her
was
very
slight
she
was
doomed
to
a
horrible
fate
her
courage
failed
her
for
the
moment
and
she
sobbed
in
terror
but
she
soon
had
herself
in
check
again
and
was
struggling
to
free
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
cords
which
held
her
wrists
were
a
trifle
looser
she
worked
at
the
knots
with
her
teeth
from
below
she
heard
a
loud
clanging
and
the
shrill
whistle
of
a
fire
siren
new
hope
surged
over
her
perhaps
the
firemen
who
had
arrived
upon
the
scene
would
reach
her
in
time
even
if
they
shoot
a
ladder
up
to
the
window
they
never
think
anyone
could
be
tied
up
in
the
closet
she
reasoned
if
i
to
escape
it
will
be
from
my
own
efforts
penny
knew
that
the
fire
was
rapidly
spreading
for
she
could
hear
a
steady
roar
which
rapidly
grew
louder
the
closet
was
so
warm
that
she
found
difficulty
in
breathing
she
could
plainly
smell
smoke
then
suddenly
almost
when
she
had
given
up
hope
she
was
free
her
wrists
were
bruised
and
bleeding
but
that
was
of
no
consequence
it
required
only
an
instant
to
untie
the
cords
which
bound
her
ankles
a
new
fear
assailed
her
the
closet
door
might
be
locked
she
turned
the
knob
and
laughed
aloud
in
hysterical
relief
it
had
not
been
locked
but
as
she
darted
out
into
the
room
she
inhaled
air
and
began
to
cough
and
choke
covering
her
face
with
her
dress
she
groped
her
way
to
the
door
it
did
not
give
as
she
tried
it
then
she
remembered
that
cron
and
his
confederates
had
locked
it
from
the
outside
she
threw
herself
against
the
wooden
panels
with
all
her
strength
but
quickly
comprehended
that
she
could
not
break
them
she
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
down
smoke
was
swirling
upward
in
such
large
black
clouds
that
she
caught
only
an
indistinct
view
of
the
street
below
the
big
red
fire
engine
had
pulled
up
beside
the
building
and
men
were
squirting
streams
of
water
on
the
roaring
blaze
penny
lifted
the
window
sill
and
climbed
out
on
the
ledge
she
clung
there
waving
one
hand
to
attract
attention
to
her
plight
below
when
the
smoke
cleared
a
little
she
could
see
a
solid
bank
of
spectators
edged
off
neatly
by
a
cordon
of
police
others
were
trying
to
push
their
way
through
the
crowd
a
great
clanging
of
bells
announced
the
arrival
of
another
fire
company
it
pulled
in
alongside
the
one
already
on
the
job
with
the
precision
of
a
war
machine
the
newcomers
drove
into
action
a
hydrant
was
quickly
tapped
and
a
long
reel
of
hose
swiftly
unwound
and
connected
a
water
tower
arose
from
the
ground
as
if
by
magic
and
soon
a
great
stream
was
pouring
from
its
peak
into
the
blazing
building
penny
shouted
for
help
although
she
knew
her
voice
would
not
carry
above
the
roar
of
the
flames
then
as
she
was
beginning
to
despair
she
was
seen
with
quick
discipline
the
firemen
placed
a
ladder
directly
beneath
the
window
slowly
it
arose
section
on
section
now
that
rescue
was
in
sight
penny
suddenly
vanished
through
the
window
back
into
the
room
from
which
she
had
escaped
the
crowd
below
groaned
in
unison
fearing
that
the
girl
had
lost
her
courage
and
was
afraid
to
descend
the
ladder
from
such
a
height
but
penny
quickly
reappeared
at
the
window
bearing
two
bulky
objects
in
her
arms
she
had
determined
to
save
the
stolen
rembrandt
and
one
of
the
copies
which
would
serve
as
damaging
evidence
against
cron
and
his
confederates
a
fireman
swiftly
mounted
the
ladder
to
help
the
girl
descend
you
have
to
leave
those
pictures
he
said
tersely
this
wall
is
about
ready
to
fall
and
we
have
to
work
fast
i
ca
leave
them
behind
penny
wailed
this
one
painting
is
worth
thousands
of
dollars
then
give
them
to
me
the
fireman
ordered
tersely
he
helped
penny
step
from
the
ledge
to
the
ladder
do
look
down
he
commanded
penny
gripped
the
sides
of
the
ladder
descending
very
slowly
with
the
fireman
just
below
to
steady
her
should
she
grow
dizzy
she
was
not
afraid
although
the
ladder
weaved
under
her
weight
even
when
a
cloud
of
dense
smoke
caused
her
to
choke
and
cough
she
did
not
falter
as
the
ground
loomed
up
she
glanced
back
at
the
window
ledge
where
she
had
clung
only
a
moment
before
flames
were
shooting
out
licking
greedily
at
the
top
rungs
of
the
ladder
a
great
shout
went
up
from
the
crowd
as
penny
stepped
to
the
ground
uninjured
here
you
are
miss
safe
and
sound
the
fireman
said
grimly
and
just
in
time
too
scarcely
had
the
ladders
been
removed
from
the
building
when
the
wall
fell
inward
penny
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
now
that
it
was
all
over
she
felt
weak
and
shaken
her
escape
had
been
such
a
narrow
one
are
you
all
right
the
fireman
asked
taking
her
arm
quite
penny
smiled
you
need
hold
me
i
not
faint
you
have
pluck
miss
and
your
wrists
are
cut
too
i
call
the
doctor
no
do
bother
it
nothing
penny
protested
where
are
my
pictures
here
the
fireman
handed
them
over
to
her
it
was
foolish
going
back
after
them
you
might
have
lost
your
life
i
realize
that
now
penny
responded
soberly
but
i
just
had
to
get
those
pictures
thank
you
for
helping
me
save
them
before
she
could
add
that
she
felt
deeply
grateful
for
her
own
rescue
as
well
the
fireman
was
called
to
another
post
with
a
policeman
as
a
bodyguard
penny
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
the
precious
rembrandt
and
the
duplicate
clutched
under
her
arm
i
send
you
to
the
hospital
where
you
can
have
those
wrists
properly
dressed
the
policeman
said
how
did
you
cut
them
trying
to
get
out
of
the
closet
penny
answered
i
was
bound
and
gagged
and
locked
in
tersely
in
response
to
the
officer
questions
she
related
her
terrifying
experience
in
the
studio
and
displayed
the
paintings
as
evidence
of
the
plot
in
which
cron
and
his
friends
were
involved
if
the
police
go
to
cron
studio
right
away
they
may
be
able
to
capture
the
entire
gang
she
finished
but
there
not
a
second
to
lose
leave
it
to
me
the
policeman
assured
her
grimly
he
communicated
with
headquarters
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
a
squad
car
picked
up
penny
and
the
officer
driving
with
all
speed
toward
the
studio
of
hanley
cron
chapter
xx
the
secret
revealed
when
hanley
cron
and
his
three
companions
abandoned
penny
to
her
fate
they
hurriedly
left
the
building
but
in
passing
down
the
hallway
hoges
carelessly
snubbed
out
a
cigarette
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
the
cigarette
smoldered
and
did
not
go
out
soon
a
tiny
flame
leaped
up
igniting
the
dirty
old
carpet
which
stretched
the
length
of
the
hall
the
fire
spread
rapidly
fed
by
wood
that
was
very
dry
and
brittle
unaware
that
they
had
started
a
disastrous
blaze
the
four
men
fled
to
hanley
cron
studio
apartment
to
make
plans
for
a
hasty
departure
the
game
up
cron
said
to
his
companions
it
christopher
nichols
ever
finds
his
daughter
he
put
the
heat
on
us
right
we
ca
get
out
of
this
town
soon
enough
divide
up
the
money
and
we
skip
hoges
answered
gruffly
cron
tore
the
cover
from
a
day
bed
couch
and
with
a
sharp
knife
slit
open
the
mattress
he
removed
a
neat
thick
roll
of
bills
how
much
max
demanded
forty
thousand
not
a
bad
haul
for
a
little
over
a
week
work
cron
laughed
triumphantly
we
sold
that
picture
seven
times
and
not
one
of
the
suckers
dared
to
squawk
if
that
nichols
girl
had
horned
in
the
racket
would
have
been
good
for
another
twenty
thousand
at
least
we
ought
to
have
kept
the
picture
hoges
complained
then
we
could
start
up
in
another
city
and
try
the
same
thing
over
again
cron
shook
his
head
too
dangerous
if
that
nichols
girl
should
escape
that
where
we
made
a
big
mistake
lynch
cut
in
we
should
have
left
anything
to
chance
it
certain
enough
cron
laughed
harshly
she
may
be
a
smart
girl
but
she
not
smart
enough
to
get
out
of
that
closet
let
divide
up
the
money
and
get
out
of
here
lynch
said
nervously
forty
thousand
dollars
that
ten
grand
apiece
the
men
began
to
argue
angrily
over
the
proposed
distribution
hoges
insisting
that
lynch
was
not
entitled
to
any
part
of
the
money
received
from
the
sale
of
the
pictures
it
was
our
racket
and
you
just
horned
in
he
protested
you
took
none
of
the
risk
if
i
pass
the
word
around
you
never
get
out
of
town
with
any
of
the
money
lynch
retorted
sneeringly
we
willing
to
divide
up
hoges
said
hastily
but
in
return
we
expect
a
split
on
the
pearl
necklace
that
was
a
deal
between
cron
and
me
the
argument
waxed
hotter
the
men
voices
rising
until
hanley
cron
feared
they
could
be
heard
outside
pipe
down
he
ordered
do
you
want
to
bring
the
police
the
important
thing
now
is
to
get
away
from
here
before
we
caught
why
not
split
everything
four
ways
and
no
hard
feelings
okay
lynch
growled
we
divide
even
where
are
the
pearls
they
safe
here
cron
answered
i
get
them
he
started
across
the
room
but
just
then
a
loud
knock
sounded
on
the
door
the
four
froze
into
tense
attitudes
better
answer
lynch
whispered
maybe
it
only
your
landlord
who
there
cron
demanded
open
up
a
voice
shouted
open
in
the
name
of
the
law
the
police
cron
muttered
in
an
undertone
quick
down
the
fire
escape
open
the
door
or
we
break
it
down
came
the
shouted
warning
cron
and
his
companions
ran
to
the
window
there
to
halt
in
dismay
as
they
faced
three
policemen
who
had
crept
up
the
iron
stairway
so
quietly
that
they
had
not
been
heard
the
four
crooks
were
covered
before
they
could
reach
for
their
guns
hands
up
an
officer
ordered
tersely
stepping
through
the
window
into
the
studio
cron
and
his
confederates
sullenly
obeyed
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
outrage
cron
asked
with
a
show
of
indignation
do
you
realize
who
i
am
maybe
we
be
more
sure
of
it
after
you
been
and
mugged
the
policeman
retorted
keep
your
hands
up
what
the
charge
against
us
lynch
questioned
with
studied
indifference
seating
himself
on
the
bed
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
arrested
he
frequently
boasted
that
no
jail
would
ever
claim
him
you
wanted
on
two
counts
the
policeman
informed
for
theft
of
a
pearl
necklace
belonging
to
dillon
and
for
stealing
a
valuable
painting
from
the
gage
galleries
anything
else
cron
inquired
sarcastically
yes
several
other
things
but
i
let
the
judge
tell
you
about
it
it
takes
evidence
to
make
an
arrest
lynch
said
sneeringly
produce
your
proof
i
introduce
you
to
our
star
witness
the
policeman
retorted
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
penny
nichols
and
six
policemen
entered
at
sight
of
the
girl
the
four
crooks
were
taken
aback
but
they
quickly
covered
their
confusion
can
you
identify
these
men
penny
was
asked
yes
i
can
she
answered
they
are
the
ones
who
locked
me
in
the
closet
and
then
set
fire
to
the
building
set
fire
to
the
building
hoges
echoed
that
a
lie
shut
up
lynch
growled
here
are
the
pictures
which
i
saved
as
evidence
penny
continued
displaying
the
original
rembrandt
and
one
of
the
copies
see
here
this
girl
is
stark
crazy
cron
interposed
i
do
know
where
she
obtained
these
pictures
but
no
one
could
be
more
delighted
to
have
the
rembrandt
recovered
than
myself
i
am
well
connected
at
the
museum
and
if
you
will
only
call
the
officials
there
they
will
assure
you
that
this
girl
is
making
a
most
unjust
accusation
you
have
pleasant
companions
a
policeman
remarked
nodding
in
lynch
direction
the
four
men
were
lined
up
and
searched
only
cron
was
found
to
have
a
gun
you
ca
get
me
on
that
he
sneered
i
have
a
permit
to
carry
a
weapon
the
forty
thousand
dollars
was
brought
to
light
quite
a
nice
haul
a
policeman
commented
examining
the
roll
of
bills
you
ca
arrest
a
man
for
having
money
in
his
pocket
lynch
said
harshly
you
do
find
it
marked
do
you
the
truth
is
you
have
no
case
against
us
cron
snapped
it
only
this
silly
girl
word
against
ours
no
doubt
she
been
reading
detective
stories
i
can
furnish
an
alibi
for
the
entire
day
lynch
added
unless
this
ridiculous
charge
is
dropped
i
warn
you
i
sue
for
false
arrest
cron
went
on
furiously
the
officers
paid
no
heed
to
the
talk
yet
they
knew
that
their
case
against
the
four
was
not
as
cron
had
said
it
was
a
matter
of
penny
nichols
testimony
against
the
four
true
she
had
the
rembrandt
as
evidence
but
it
might
be
difficult
to
prove
that
the
four
men
had
been
involved
in
the
theft
they
had
painful
recollections
of
other
cases
against
max
lynch
which
had
dissolved
like
soap
bubbles
in
a
wind
the
man
had
no
equal
at
producing
unexpected
witnesses
who
for
a
sum
of
money
would
provide
him
with
a
complete
alibi
his
lawyer
employed
at
a
yearly
salary
was
as
clever
as
he
was
unscrupulous
search
the
room
the
police
captain
ordered
the
dillon
pearls
must
be
here
the
men
set
about
their
task
with
system
and
thoroughness
they
examined
every
inch
of
the
mattress
they
went
through
all
of
the
clothing
even
ripping
out
the
linings
of
coats
and
jackets
the
floor
boards
were
tested
to
learn
if
any
had
been
recently
loosened
you
not
find
the
necklace
here
cron
said
harshly
penny
watched
the
search
with
growing
uneasiness
she
had
felt
certain
that
the
pearls
would
be
found
in
the
studio
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
while
tied
in
the
closet
had
led
her
to
believe
that
the
necklace
was
in
cron
possession
it
must
be
somewhere
in
the
room
she
crossed
over
to
a
bookcase
which
the
officers
had
not
yet
examined
instantly
she
noted
that
hanley
cron
was
watching
her
intently
she
lifted
out
the
lower
row
of
volumes
nothing
had
been
hidden
behind
them
little
miss
detective
cron
jeered
penny
took
out
a
few
of
the
books
on
the
second
shelf
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
surprise
my
black
imp
she
exclaimed
wheeling
toward
cron
so
you
were
the
one
who
entered
my
room
and
stole
it
triumphantly
she
caught
up
the
little
clay
figure
from
its
hiding
place
now
i
know
you
crazy
cron
snapped
someone
sent
that
figure
to
me
in
the
mail
and
rightly
it
should
have
been
returned
to
me
too
you
and
that
coulter
girl
came
here
and
robbed
me
of
it
penny
gazed
thoughtfully
down
at
the
black
imp
she
recalled
how
startled
max
lynch
had
been
when
he
had
viewed
it
on
her
father
desk
then
later
either
cron
or
an
agent
of
his
had
risked
capture
to
enter
the
nichols
house
and
recover
the
little
statue
why
was
it
so
valuable
what
secret
did
it
guard
suddenly
penny
knew
with
a
triumphant
laugh
she
raised
the
black
imp
and
hurled
it
against
the
wall
it
shattered
into
a
dozen
pieces
say
what
the
idea
a
policeman
demanded
then
he
stared
down
at
the
floor
among
the
broken
fragments
of
day
lay
dillon
pearl
necklace
there
your
evidence
penny
said
calmly
i
think
even
max
lynch
may
find
it
difficult
to
alibi
this
with
a
fatalistic
shrug
the
gambler
turned
to
the
policeman
who
guarded
him
you
win
he
said
buckle
on
the
cuffs
and
let
go
there
something
i
like
to
learn
before
you
take
these
men
away
penny
mentioned
to
the
captain
hoges
has
a
letter
in
his
possession
which
i
wish
i
might
examine
is
this
the
one
you
mean
the
officer
asked
the
envelope
he
indicated
had
been
taken
from
hoges
when
he
was
searched
a
few
minutes
before
i
think
it
is
the
policeman
handed
penny
the
letter
and
he
quickly
examined
it
this
is
the
right
one
she
said
in
relief
and
it
exonerates
amy
coulter
of
any
wrong
doing
the
brief
message
read
hoges
i
shall
be
unable
to
accept
the
work
which
you
offered
me
i
am
returning
the
money
paid
me
as
an
advance
fee
penny
was
jubilant
at
the
way
matters
had
ended
she
had
many
questions
to
ask
cron
and
max
lynch
but
she
decided
to
postpone
them
realizing
that
the
men
were
not
likely
to
reveal
anything
which
could
be
used
as
evidence
against
them
as
the
four
crooks
were
led
away
the
captain
waited
to
compliment
penny
for
her
valuable
assistance
tell
me
young
lady
he
commanded
admiringly
how
did
you
know
dillon
pearls
were
hidden
inside
that
clay
figure
i
was
absolutely
certain
penny
admitted
but
a
number
of
things
made
me
suspicious
first
i
recalled
that
the
man
who
snatched
the
necklace
from
dillon
ran
into
this
studio
could
you
identify
that
man
i
think
you
already
have
him
under
arrest
i
do
know
his
name
but
i
feel
certain
he
is
the
same
person
now
that
i
have
viewed
him
closely
he
ran
into
this
studio
you
say
yes
and
when
i
entered
i
found
hanley
cron
modeling
the
black
imp
the
possibility
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
but
now
i
know
he
must
have
received
the
pearls
from
the
actual
thief
and
molded
them
into
the
wet
clay
a
very
clever
scheme
yes
and
it
would
have
succeeded
save
for
one
thing
cron
copied
the
statue
of
amy
coulter
black
imp
we
thought
he
intended
to
put
it
to
some
commercial
use
and
took
it
from
him
he
permitted
you
to
take
it
away
the
officer
asked
in
surprise
it
happened
that
a
policeman
came
into
the
studio
i
think
he
must
have
been
afraid
to
make
a
fuss
undoubtedly
then
what
happened
i
took
the
statue
to
my
father
office
max
lynch
came
to
talk
with
dad
and
saw
it
he
hurried
out
of
the
office
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
of
course
he
knew
the
pearls
were
hidden
inside
the
statue
the
officer
smiled
he
probably
thought
nichols
had
discovered
them
and
suspected
the
plot
that
the
way
i
figured
it
out
penny
nodded
our
house
was
watched
then
one
day
the
black
imp
mysteriously
disappeared
i
never
saw
it
again
until
i
entered
this
room
either
cron
or
lynch
stole
it
cron
i
think
for
the
black
imp
was
in
his
possession
well
young
lady
you
done
a
fine
bit
of
work
today
the
captain
said
soberly
it
evident
that
you
destined
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
your
illustrious
father
thank
you
sir
penny
flushed
with
the
four
crooks
on
their
way
to
jail
and
the
rembrandt
and
the
pearl
necklace
in
the
possession
of
the
police
she
felt
that
her
responsibility
was
ended
calling
a
taxicab
she
drove
to
amy
coulter
new
rooming
house
i
have
wonderful
news
for
you
she
greeted
the
girl
the
painting
has
been
recovered
then
i
exonerated
completely
oh
penny
it
your
doing
i
know
how
can
i
thank
you
tears
of
joy
streamed
down
amy
face
she
listened
breathlessly
to
the
story
penny
related
so
george
hoges
turned
out
to
be
a
thief
she
exclaimed
when
he
asked
me
to
copy
a
painting
for
him
i
was
suspicious
that
he
had
involved
himself
in
something
dishonest
penny
spoke
of
the
meeting
she
had
witnessed
in
the
park
yes
hoges
gave
me
money
amy
acknowledged
ruefully
i
needed
it
so
badly
or
i
should
have
listened
to
him
then
you
knew
you
were
to
copy
the
rembrandt
penny
questioned
quickly
oh
no
he
did
tell
me
what
painting
i
was
to
reproduce
i
accepted
the
money
because
i
needed
it
so
badly
later
when
i
thought
the
matter
over
more
carefully
i
realized
that
the
scheme
could
be
an
honest
one
so
i
sent
the
money
back
a
fortunate
thing
that
you
did
penny
commented
had
you
kept
the
money
you
might
have
been
accused
of
being
one
of
the
gang
i
glad
the
painting
has
been
recovered
amy
said
and
to
think
that
my
little
black
imp
guarded
the
hiding
place
of
jewels
penny
remembered
that
she
had
a
taxicab
waiting
outside
and
hastily
said
goodbye
when
she
reached
her
father
office
he
was
talking
on
the
telephone
he
smiled
broadly
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
well
i
heard
all
about
it
he
declared
you
be
famous
as
soon
as
the
evening
papers
are
on
the
street
reporters
are
on
their
way
here
now
it
developed
that
nichols
had
not
been
informed
of
all
the
details
of
penny
remarkable
adventure
he
was
quite
shaken
when
he
learned
of
her
narrow
escape
from
death
in
the
burning
building
the
warmth
of
his
praise
for
her
courage
brought
the
color
rushing
to
the
cheeks
i
only
hope
cron
and
his
friends
receive
the
sentences
they
deserve
she
commented
do
worry
they
will
penny
you
fairly
snowed
them
under
with
damaging
evidence
nichols
was
entirely
correct
in
his
opinion
under
police
grilling
hoges
and
cron
confessed
to
the
crimes
for
which
they
were
charged
max
lynch
refused
to
plead
guilty
but
in
the
end
a
long
legal
battle
availed
him
nothing
with
his
three
companions
he
was
sentenced
to
the
state
penitentiary
hanley
cron
in
his
confession
admitted
that
he
had
accepted
a
fee
as
a
bribe
for
awarding
the
huddleson
prize
to
winged
night
a
statue
of
inferior
merit
the
entire
contest
therefore
was
declared
void
months
later
a
new
competition
was
held
and
to
the
delight
of
everyone
amy
coulter
black
imp
won
the
cherished
prize
penny
and
her
father
were
not
to
learn
of
these
important
developments
for
some
time
but
they
were
both
elated
at
the
outcome
of
the
case
well
you
seem
to
have
relieved
your
old
dad
of
a
job
the
detective
smiled
now
that
dillon
necklace
has
been
recovered
my
work
for
the
insurance
company
is
over
i
hope
you
have
been
cheated
out
of
any
fat
fees
on
my
account
the
company
will
be
pleased
because
its
financial
responsibility
to
dillon
is
over
the
detective
answered
i
may
charge
a
double
fee
on
the
strength
of
your
work
and
do
i
get
half
of
it
penny
countered
her
father
smiled
broadly
perhaps
if
you
promise
to
lock
it
up
in
your
bank
account
he
added
with
a
chuckle
i
believe
i
could
increase
my
profits
by
taking
you
into
the
firm
and
nichols
how
does
that
strike
you
i
think
it
would
look
grand
in
print
penny
laughed
let
paint
it
on
the
door
right
now
the
end
