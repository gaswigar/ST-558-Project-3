discerning
critic
once
pointed
out
that
edgar
allen
poe
possessed
not
so
much
a
distinctive
style
as
a
distinctive
so
startlingly
original
was
his
approach
to
the
dark
castles
and
haunted
woodlands
of
his
own
somber
creation
that
he
transcended
the
literary
by
the
sheer
magic
of
his
prose
something
of
that
same
magic
gleams
in
the
little
fantasy
presented
here
beneath
evelyn
smith
eerily
enchanted
the
doorway
evelyn
a
man
may
wish
he
married
his
first
love
and
not
really
mean
it
but
an
insincere
wish
may
turn
ugly
in
dimensions
unknown
it
is
my
theory
professor
falabella
said
helping
himself
to
a
cookie
that
no
one
ever
really
makes
a
decision
what
really
happens
is
that
whenever
alternative
courses
of
action
are
called
for
the
individuality
splits
up
and
continues
on
two
or
more
divergent
planes
very
much
like
the
parthenogenesis
of
a
unicellular
animal
delicious
cookies
these
mrs
hughes
thank
you
professor
gloria
simpered
i
made
them
myself
you
must
give
us
the
recipe
said
one
of
the
ladies
and
the
others
murmured
agreement
glad
to
get
their
individualities
on
a
plane
they
could
understand
since
most
decisions
are
hardly
as
momentous
as
the
individual
imagines
professor
falabella
continued
and
since
the
imagination
of
the
average
individual
is
very
limited
many
of
these
different
planes
or
as
they
are
colloquially
known
continuums
may
exist
in
close
even
tangential
relationship
gloria
rose
unobtrusively
and
took
the
teapot
to
the
kitchen
for
a
refill
her
husband
stood
by
the
sink
moodily
drinking
whiskey
out
of
the
bottle
so
as
to
avoid
having
to
wash
a
glass
afterward
bill
you
not
being
polite
to
our
guests
why
do
you
go
out
and
listen
to
professor
falabella
i
can
hear
him
perfectly
well
from
here
bill
muttered
and
indeed
the
professor
mellifluous
tones
pervaded
every
nook
and
cranny
of
the
house
cultist
what
is
he
a
professor
of
like
to
know
professor
falabella
is
a
cultist
affirmed
gloria
angrily
a
great
philosopher
bill
hughes
said
something
unprintable
if
i
married
lucy
allison
he
continued
unkindly
she
never
have
filled
the
house
with
cultists
on
my
day
of
rest
gloria
soft
chin
trembled
and
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
was
beginning
to
put
on
weight
he
noticed
i
been
hearing
nothing
but
lucy
allison
lucy
allison
lucy
allison
for
the
past
year
said
yourself
she
looked
like
a
horse
horses
he
observed
have
sense
he
was
being
brutal
but
he
could
help
it
and
did
want
to
professor
falabella
was
only
the
most
of
a
long
series
of
mystics
gloria
was
forever
dragging
into
the
house
trouble
with
the
he
thought
bitterly
that
they
seek
culture
in
the
most
peculiar
i
bet
she
would
have
let
me
have
peace
on
sunday
he
said
it
just
goes
to
show
what
happens
when
you
marry
a
woman
solely
for
her
looks
he
drained
the
bottle
then
hurled
it
into
the
garbage
pail
with
a
resounding
crash
gloria
shoulders
shook
as
she
filled
the
kettle
i
wish
i
decided
to
be
an
old
maid
she
sobbed
a
very
unlikely
possibility
he
thought
even
now
shopworn
as
she
was
gloria
could
have
a
fairly
wide
range
of
suitors
should
something
happen
to
him
she
looked
sexy
but
how
deceiving
appearances
could
be
professor
falabella
was
still
talking
as
bill
and
gloria
emerged
from
the
kitchen
i
believe
that
it
is
possible
for
an
individual
who
exists
on
a
limited
plane
of
imagination
to
transpose
from
one
plane
to
an
adjacent
one
without
difficulty
great
heavens
what
was
that
something
had
whisked
past
the
archway
leading
into
the
foyer
do
pay
any
attention
gloria
smiled
nervously
the
house
is
haunted
my
dear
one
of
the
ladies
offered
i
know
of
the
most
marvelous
exterminator
the
house
gloria
assured
her
coldly
really
haunted
we
been
seeing
things
ever
since
we
moved
in
and
she
really
believed
it
bill
thought
believed
that
the
house
was
haunted
that
is
of
course
he
had
seen
things
too
but
he
was
enlightened
enough
to
know
that
ghosts
do
exist
even
if
you
do
see
them
professor
falabella
cleared
his
throat
as
i
was
saying
it
is
possible
to
send
the
individual
through
another
well
dimension
as
some
popular
writers
would
have
it
to
one
of
his
other
spatial
existences
on
the
same
temporal
plane
it
is
merely
necessary
for
him
to
find
the
door
nonsense
bill
interrupted
holy
unmitigated
nonsense
every
head
swivelled
to
look
at
him
gloria
restrained
tears
with
an
effort
brute
someone
muttered
but
ridicule
apparently
only
stimulated
the
professor
he
beamed
you
do
believe
me
your
imagination
can
not
extend
to
the
comprehension
of
the
multifariousness
of
space
nonsense
bill
said
again
but
less
confidently
i
believe
that
i
have
discovered
the
doorway
professor
falabella
continued
and
the
way
is
open
however
most
people
fear
to
penetrate
the
unknown
even
though
it
is
to
enter
another
phase
of
their
own
existence
i
do
admit
that
the
shock
of
spatial
transference
no
matter
how
slight
combined
with
the
concrete
awareness
of
a
previous
spatial
relationship
would
be
perhaps
too
much
for
the
keenly
sensitive
individualism
bill
opened
his
mouth
i
know
what
you
about
to
say
young
man
you
do
have
to
be
a
mind
reader
to
know
that
bill
assured
him
his
consonants
were
already
a
little
slurred
and
he
knew
gloria
was
ashamed
of
him
it
served
her
right
he
been
ashamed
of
her
for
years
professor
falabella
smiled
his
teeth
were
very
sharp
and
white
very
well
hughes
since
you
are
a
skeptic
perhaps
you
will
not
object
to
being
the
subject
of
our
experiment
yourself
what
kind
of
an
experiment
bill
asked
suspiciously
merely
to
go
through
the
door
any
door
can
become
the
doorway
if
it
is
transposed
into
the
proper
spatial
dimension
that
door
for
instance
professor
falabella
waved
his
hand
toward
the
doorway
of
what
gloria
liked
to
call
bill
study
you
mean
you
just
want
me
to
open
the
door
and
go
into
that
room
bill
asked
incredulously
that
all
that
is
all
of
course
you
go
with
the
awareness
that
it
is
the
threshold
of
another
plane
and
that
you
step
voluntarily
from
this
existence
to
an
adjacent
one
sure
bill
said
he
had
just
remembered
there
was
a
nearly
full
bottle
of
calvert
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
desk
sure
anything
to
oblige
very
well
go
to
the
door
and
keep
remembering
that
of
your
own
free
will
you
are
passing
from
this
plane
to
the
next
look
out
everybody
bill
called
raucously
as
he
pulled
open
the
door
i
coming
in
on
the
next
plane
no
one
laughed
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
shutting
the
door
firmly
behind
him
a
wonderful
excuse
to
get
away
from
those
blasted
women
he
climb
out
of
the
window
as
soon
as
he
collected
the
whiskey
and
give
them
a
nervous
moment
thinking
he
really
passed
into
another
existence
it
would
serve
gloria
right
for
a
moment
as
he
crossed
he
had
a
queer
sensation
maybe
there
was
something
in
what
professor
falabella
said
but
no
there
he
was
in
the
study
all
that
mumbo
jumbo
was
getting
him
down
that
was
all
he
was
a
nervous
man
only
nobody
appreciated
the
fact
taking
a
cigarette
out
of
the
pack
in
his
pocket
he
reached
for
the
lighter
on
his
desk
it
was
there
time
and
time
again
he
told
gloria
not
to
touch
his
things
and
always
she
disobeyed
him
company
was
coming
and
she
must
tidy
up
cooking
and
cleaning
that
was
all
she
was
good
for
but
this
was
carrying
tidiness
too
far
she
even
removed
the
ashtrays
and
where
did
that
glass
block
paperweight
come
from
he
had
a
penguin
in
a
snowstorm
and
he
been
happy
with
it
this
was
too
much
he
tell
gloria
off
stealing
a
man
penguin
he
opened
the
door
into
the
living
room
and
bumped
into
lucy
allison
do
you
think
you
been
in
there
long
enough
bill
she
asked
acridly
i
sure
your
guests
would
appreciate
catching
a
glimpse
of
you
why
hello
lucy
he
said
surprised
i
did
know
gloria
had
invited
you
gloria
gloria
gloria
lucy
cut
across
his
sentence
you
been
talking
about
nothing
but
that
dumb
little
blonde
for
months
because
of
the
people
in
the
room
beyond
her
voice
was
pitched
low
but
her
pale
eyes
glittered
unpleasantly
behind
her
spectacles
i
wish
you
had
married
her
you
have
made
a
fine
pair
gently
caressingly
the
short
hairs
on
the
back
of
bill
neck
rose
come
back
in
here
lucy
said
hauling
him
back
into
the
living
room
where
a
number
of
people
who
had
been
enjoying
the
domestic
fracas
suddenly
broke
into
loud
and
animated
chatter
hildebrand
was
telling
us
all
about
nuclear
fission
ca
find
an
ashtray
bill
muttered
seizing
on
something
tangible
ca
find
an
ashtray
in
the
whole
darn
place
we
been
over
this
millions
of
times
bill
you
know
she
smiled
at
the
guests
a
smile
that
carefully
excluded
i
allergic
to
smoke
but
i
never
can
get
my
husband
to
remember
he
is
to
smoke
inside
the
house
now
take
the
neutron
for
example
hildebrand
said
through
a
mouthful
of
pâté
what
is
the
neutron
it
is
only
what
was
that
the
wraith
of
gloria
crossed
the
foyer
and
disappeared
bill
took
a
step
forward
then
stood
still
lucy
smiled
that
nothing
at
all
the
house
is
merely
haunted
everyone
laughed
forgot
something
bill
muttered
and
dashed
back
into
the
study
he
yanked
open
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
desk
sure
enough
there
was
a
bottle
of
schenley
nearly
a
third
full
there
are
some
advantages
he
thought
as
he
tilted
it
to
his
lips
in
having
a
limited
imagination
