love

you
woke
up
one
day
and
walt

had
taken
over
the

not
only
that
but
money
been
abolished
and
somebody
developed
the
cure
for
death
welcome
to
the
bitchun
society
and
make

strapped
in
tight
because
it
going
to
be
a

here
in

spiritual
center
of
the

society
he
struggles
to
find
and
preserve
the
original
human
face
of
the
magic
kingdom
against
the
young
and
increasingly
alien
inheritors
of
the
earth
now
that
any
experience
can
be
simulated
human
relationships
become
ever
more
fragile
and
to
julius
the
corny
mechanical
ghosts
of
the
haunted
mansion
have
come
to
seem
like
a
precious
link
to
a
past
when
we
could
tell
the
real

simulated

true

false
cory

vibrant

lie
ideas
we
should
all
pay

i
check
his

about
ten

because
he
always
one
of
the
first
to
notice
a
major
incursion
from
the

and
his
voice
is
a
compelling
vehicle
for
news
from
the
future
down

out
in
the

is
about
a
world
that
is
visible
in
its
outlines
today

knows
where
to
look
and
how

doctorow
is
more
than
just
a
sick
mind
looking
to
twist
the

whose
realities
remain
uncorrupted
though
that
should
be
enough
recommendation
to
read
his
work

out

black
comedic
prophecy
on
the
dangers
of
surrendering
our
consensual

i
compulsively

prologue
i
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
cure
for
death
to
see
the
rise
of
the
bitchun
society
to
learn
ten
languages
to
compose
three
symphonies
to
realize
my
boyhood
dream
of
taking
up
residence
in
disney
world
to
see
the
death
of
the
workplace
and
of
work
i
never
thought
i
live
to
see
the
day
when
keep
dan
would
decide
to
deadhead
until
the
heat
death
of
the
universe
dan
was
in
his
second
or
third
blush
of
youth
when
i
first
met
him
sometime
he
was
a
rangy
cowpoke
apparent
or
so
all
rawhide
and
sunburned
neck
boots
worn
thin
and
infinitely
comfortable
i
was
in
the
middle
of
my
chem
thesis
my
fourth
doctorate
and
he
was
taking
a
break
from
saving
the
world
chilling
on
campus
in
toronto
and
for
some
poor
anthro
major
we
hooked
up
at
the
grad
students
union
the
gsu
or
gazoo
for
those
who
knew
on
a
busy
friday
night
i
was
fighting
a
battle
for
a
stool
at
the
scratched
bar
inching
my
way
closer
every
time
the
press
of
bodies
shifted
and
he
had
one
of
the
few
seats
surrounded
by
a
litter
of
cigarette
junk
and
empties
clearly
encamped
some
duration
into
my
foray
he
cocked
his
head
at
me
and
raised
a
bleached
eyebrow
you
get
any
closer
son
and
we
going
to
have
to
get
a
i
was
apparent
forty
or
so
and
i
thought
about
bridling
at
being
called
son
but
i
looked
into
his
eyes
and
decided
that
he
had
enough
realtime
that
he
could
call
me
son
anytime
he
wanted
i
backed
off
a
little
and
apologized
he
struck
a
cig
and
blew
a
pungent
strong
plume
over
the
head
do
worry
about
it
i
probably
a
little
over
accustomed
to
personal
space
i
could
remember
the
last
time
i
heard
anyone
talk
about
personal
space
with
the
mortality
rate
at
zero
and
the
at
the
world
was
inexorably
accreting
a
dense
carpet
of
people
even
with
the
migratory
and
deadhead
drains
on
the
population
been
jaunting
i
asked
his
eyes
were
too
sharp
for
him
to
have
missed
an
instant
experience
to
deadheading
he
chuckled
no
sir
not
me
i
into
the
kind
of
macho
shitheadery
that
you
only
come
across
jaunting
for
play
i
need
work
the
tinkled
a
counterpoint
i
took
a
moment
to
conjure
a
hud
with
his
whuffie
score
on
it
i
had
to
resize
the
window
he
had
too
many
zeroes
to
fit
on
my
standard
display
i
tried
to
act
cool
but
he
caught
the
upwards
flick
of
my
eyes
and
then
their
involuntary
widening
he
tried
a
little
gave
it
up
and
let
a
prideful
grin
show
i
try
not
to
pay
it
much
mind
some
people
they
get
overly
grateful
he
must
seen
my
eyes
flick
up
again
to
pull
his
whuffie
history
wait
do
go
doing
that
i
tell
you
about
it
you
really
got
to
know
damn
you
know
it
so
easy
to
get
used
to
life
without
hyperlinks
you
think
you
really
miss
but
you
do
and
it
clicked
for
me
he
was
a
missionary
one
of
those
dwellers
who
act
as
emissary
from
the
bitchun
society
to
the
benighted
corners
of
the
world
where
for
whatever
reasons
they
want
to
die
starve
and
choke
on
petrochem
waste
it
amazing
that
these
communities
survive
more
than
a
generation
in
the
bitchun
society
proper
we
usually
outlive
our
detractors
the
missionaries
do
have
such
a
high
success
rate
you
have
to
be
awfully
convincing
to
get
through
to
a
culture
that
already
successfully
resisted
nearly
a
century
worth
of
propaganda
but
when
you
convert
a
whole
village
you
accrue
all
the
whuffie
they
have
to
give
more
often
missionaries
end
up
getting
refreshed
from
a
backup
after
they
are
heard
from
for
a
decade
or
so
i
never
met
one
in
the
flesh
before
how
many
successful
missions
have
you
had
i
asked
figured
it
out
huh
i
just
come
off
my
fifth
in
twenty
years
counterrevolutionaries
hidden
out
in
the
old
cheyenne
mountain
norad
site
still
there
a
generation
later
he
sandpapered
his
whiskers
with
his
fingertips
their
parents
went
to
ground
after
their
life
savings
vanished
and
they
had
no
use
for
tech
any
more
advanced
than
a
rifle
plenty
of
those
though
he
spun
a
fascinating
yarn
then
how
he
slowly
gained
the
acceptance
of
the
and
then
their
trust
and
then
betrayed
it
in
subtle
beneficent
ways
introducing
free
energy
to
their
greenhouses
then
a
gengineered
crop
or
two
then
curing
a
couple
deaths
slowly
inching
them
toward
the
bitchun
society
until
they
could
remember
why
they
had
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
it
from
the
start
now
they
were
mostly
exploring
toy
frontiers
with
unlimited
energy
and
unlimited
supplies
and
deadheading
through
the
dull
times
en
route
i
guess
it
be
too
much
of
a
shock
for
them
to
stay
they
think
of
us
as
the
enemy
you
know
they
had
all
kinds
of
plans
drawn
up
for
when
we
invaded
them
and
took
them
away
hollow
suicide
teeth
points
for
the
survivors
they
just
ca
get
over
hating
us
even
though
we
do
even
know
they
exist
they
can
pretend
that
they
still
living
rough
and
hard
he
rubbed
his
chin
again
his
hard
calluses
grating
over
his
whiskers
but
for
me
the
real
rough
life
is
right
here
the
little
enclaves
each
one
is
like
an
alternate
history
of
humanity
what
if
we
taken
the
free
energy
but
not
deadheading
what
if
taken
deadheading
but
only
for
the
critically
ill
not
for
people
who
did
want
to
be
bored
on
long
or
no
hyperlinks
no
adhocracy
no
whuffie
each
one
is
different
and
wonderful
i
have
a
stupid
habit
of
arguing
for
the
sake
of
and
i
found
myself
saying
wonderful
oh
sure
nothing
finer
than
oh
let
see
dying
starving
freezing
broiling
killing
cruelty
and
ignorance
and
pain
and
misery
i
know
i
sure
miss
it
keep
dan
snorted
you
think
a
junkie
misses
sobriety
i
knocked
on
the
bar
hello
there
are
any
junkies
anymore
he
struck
another
cig
but
you
know
what
a
junkie
right
junkies
do
miss
sobriety
because
they
do
remember
how
sharp
everything
was
how
the
pain
made
the
joy
sweeter
we
ca
remember
what
it
was
like
to
work
to
earn
our
keep
to
worry
that
there
might
not
be
that
we
might
get
sick
or
get
hit
by
a
bus
we
do
remember
what
it
was
like
to
take
chances
and
we
sure
as
shit
do
remember
what
it
felt
like
to
have
them
pay
off
he
had
a
point
here
i
was
only
in
my
second
or
third
adulthood
and
already
ready
to
toss
it
all
in
and
do
something
else
he
had
a
point
but
i
was
about
to
admit
it
so
you
say
i
say
i
take
a
chance
when
i
strike
up
a
conversation
in
a
bar
when
i
fall
in
love
and
what
about
the
deadheads
two
people
i
know
they
just
went
deadhead
for
ten
thousand
years
tell
me
that
not
taking
a
chance
truth
be
told
almost
everyone
i
known
in
my
years
were
deadheading
or
jaunting
or
just
lonely
days
then
brother
that
committing
suicide
the
way
we
going
they
be
lucky
if
someone
does
just
switch
off
when
it
comes
time
to
reanimate
in
case
you
have
noticed
it
getting
a
little
crowded
around
here
i
made
sounds
and
wiped
off
my
forehead
with
a
the
gazoo
was
beastly
hot
on
summer
nights
just
like
the
world
was
getting
a
little
crowded
a
hundred
years
ago
before
free
energy
like
it
was
getting
too
greenhousey
too
nukey
too
hot
or
too
cold
we
fixed
it
then
we
fix
it
again
when
the
time
comes
i
gon
na
be
here
in
ten
thousand
years
you
damn
betcha
but
i
think
i
do
it
the
long
way
around
he
cocked
his
head
again
and
gave
it
some
thought
if
it
had
been
any
of
the
other
grad
students
i
have
assumed
he
was
grepping
for
some
bolstering
factoids
to
support
his
next
sally
but
with
him
i
just
knew
he
was
thinking
about
it
the
way
i
think
that
if
i
still
here
in
ten
thousand
years
i
going
to
be
crazy
as
hell
ten
thousand
years
pal
ten
thousand
years
ago
the
was
a
goat
you
really
think
you
going
to
be
anything
recognizably
human
in
a
hundred
centuries
me
i
not
interested
in
being
a
i
going
to
wake
up
one
day
and
going
to
say
i
guess
i
seen
about
enough
and
that
be
my
last
day
i
had
seen
where
he
was
going
with
this
and
i
had
stopped
paying
attention
while
i
readied
my
response
i
probably
should
have
paid
more
attention
but
why
why
not
just
deadhead
for
a
few
centuries
see
if
there
anything
that
takes
your
fancy
and
if
not
back
to
sleep
for
a
few
more
why
do
anything
so
he
embarrassed
me
by
making
a
show
of
thinking
it
over
again
making
me
feel
like
i
was
just
a
glib
poltroon
i
suppose
because
nothing
else
is
i
always
known
that
someday
i
was
going
to
stop
moving
stop
seeking
stop
kicking
and
have
done
with
it
come
a
day
when
i
do
have
anything
left
to
do
except
stop
on
campus
they
called
him
dan
because
of
his
cowboy
vibe
and
because
of
his
lifestyle
and
he
somehow
grew
to
take
over
every
conversation
i
had
for
the
next
six
months
i
pinged
his
whuffie
a
few
times
and
noticed
that
it
was
climbing
steadily
upward
as
he
accumulated
more
esteem
from
the
people
he
met
i
pretty
much
pissed
away
most
of
my
whuffie
all
the
savings
from
the
symphonies
and
the
first
three
theses
drinking
myself
stupid
at
the
gazoo
hogging
library
terminals
pestering
profs
until
expended
all
the
respect
anyone
had
ever
afforded
me
all
except
dan
who
for
some
reason
stood
me
to
regular
beers
and
meals
and
movies
i
got
to
feeling
like
i
was
someone
special
not
everyone
had
a
chum
as
exotic
as
dan
the
legendary
missionary
who
visited
the
only
places
left
that
were
closed
to
the
bitchun
society
i
ca
say
for
sure
why
he
hung
around
with
me
he
mentioned
once
or
twice
that
he
liked
my
symphonies
and
he
read
my
ergonomics
thesis
on
applying
techniques
in
urban
settings
and
liked
what
i
had
to
say
there
but
i
think
it
came
down
to
us
having
a
good
time
needling
each
other
i
talk
to
him
about
the
vast
carpet
of
the
future
unrolling
before
us
of
the
certainty
that
we
would
encounter
alien
intelligences
some
day
of
the
unimaginable
frontiers
open
to
each
of
us
he
tell
me
that
deadheading
was
a
strong
indicator
that
one
personal
reservoir
of
introspection
and
creativity
was
dry
and
that
without
struggle
there
is
no
real
victory
this
was
a
good
fight
one
we
could
have
a
thousand
times
without
resolving
i
get
him
to
concede
that
whuffie
recaptured
the
true
essence
of
money
in
the
old
days
if
you
were
broke
but
respected
you
would
starve
contrariwise
if
you
were
rich
and
hated
no
sum
could
buy
you
security
and
peace
by
measuring
the
thing
that
money
really
represented
your
personal
capital
with
your
friends
and
neighbors
you
more
accurately
gauged
your
success
and
then
he
lead
me
down
a
subtle
carefully
baited
trail
that
led
to
my
allowing
that
while
yes
we
might
someday
encounter
alien
species
with
wild
and
fabulous
ways
that
right
now
there
was
a
slightly
depressing
homogeneity
to
the
world
on
a
fine
spring
day
i
defended
my
thesis
to
two
embodied
humans
and
one
prof
whose
body
was
out
for
an
overhaul
whose
consciousness
was
present
via
speakerphone
from
the
computer
where
it
was
resting
they
all
liked
it
i
collected
my
sheepskin
and
went
out
hunting
for
dan
in
the
sweet
streets
he
gone
the
anthro
major
he
been
torturing
with
his
said
that
they
wrapped
up
that
morning
and
he
headed
to
the
walled
city
of
tijuana
to
take
his
shot
with
the
descendants
of
a
platoon
of
us
marines
who
settled
there
and
cut
themselves
off
from
the
bitchun
society
so
i
went
to
disney
world
in
deference
to
dan
i
took
the
flight
in
realtime
in
the
minuscule
cabin
reserved
for
those
of
us
who
stubbornly
refused
to
be
frozen
and
stacked
like
cordwood
for
the
two
hour
flight
i
was
the
only
one
taking
the
trip
in
realtime
but
a
flight
attendant
dutifully
served
me
a
orange
juice
and
a
rubbery
pungent
cheese
omelet
i
stared
out
the
windows
at
the
infinite
clouds
while
the
autopilot
banked
around
the
turbulence
and
wondered
when
i
see
dan
next
chapter
my
girlfriend
was
percent
of
my
age
and
i
was
enough
that
it
bugged
me
her
name
was
lil
and
she
was
disney
world
her
parents
being
among
the
original
that
took
over
the
management
of
liberty
square
and
tom
sawyer
island
she
was
quite
literally
raised
in
walt
disney
world
and
it
showed
it
showed
she
was
neat
and
efficient
in
her
every
little
thing
from
her
shining
red
hair
to
her
careful
accounting
of
each
gear
and
cog
in
the
animatronics
that
were
in
her
charge
her
folks
were
in
canopic
jars
in
kissimmee
deadheading
for
a
few
centuries
on
a
muggy
wednesday
we
dangled
our
feet
over
the
edge
of
the
liberty
belle
riverboat
pier
watching
the
listless
confederate
flag
over
fort
langhorn
on
tom
sawyer
island
by
moonlight
the
magic
kingdom
was
all
closed
up
and
every
last
guest
had
been
chased
out
the
gate
underneath
the
main
street
train
station
and
we
were
able
to
breathe
a
heavy
sigh
of
relief
shuck
parts
of
our
costumes
and
relax
together
while
the
cicadas
sang
i
was
more
than
a
century
old
but
there
was
still
a
kind
of
magic
in
having
my
arm
around
the
warm
fine
shoulders
of
a
girl
by
moonlight
hidden
from
the
hustle
of
the
cleaning
teams
by
the
turnstiles
breathing
the
warm
moist
air
lil
plumped
her
head
against
my
shoulder
and
gave
me
a
butterfly
kiss
under
my
jaw
her
name
was
mcgill
i
sang
gently
but
she
called
herself
lil
she
sang
warm
breath
on
my
collarbones
and
everyone
knew
her
as
nancy
i
sang
i
been
startled
to
know
that
she
knew
the
beatles
they
been
old
news
in
my
youth
after
all
but
her
parents
had
given
her
a
thorough
if
eclectic
education
want
to
do
a
she
asked
it
was
one
of
her
favorite
duties
exploring
every
inch
of
the
rides
in
her
care
with
the
lights
on
after
the
horde
of
tourists
had
gone
we
both
liked
to
see
the
underpinnings
of
the
magic
maybe
that
was
why
i
kept
picking
at
the
relationship
i
a
little
pooped
let
sit
a
while
longer
if
you
do
mind
she
heaved
a
dramatic
sigh
oh
all
right
old
man
she
reached
up
and
gently
tweaked
my
nipple
and
i
gave
a
satisfying
little
jump
i
think
the
age
difference
bothered
her
too
though
she
teased
me
for
letting
it
get
to
me
i
think
i
be
able
to
manage
a
totter
through
the
haunted
mansion
if
you
just
give
me
a
moment
to
rest
my
bursitis
i
felt
her
smile
against
my
shirt
she
loved
the
mansion
loved
to
turn
on
the
ballroom
ghosts
and
dance
their
waltz
with
them
on
the
dusty
floor
loved
to
try
and
stare
down
the
marble
busts
in
the
library
that
followed
your
gaze
as
you
passed
i
liked
it
too
but
i
really
liked
just
sitting
there
with
her
watching
the
water
and
the
trees
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
when
i
heard
a
soft
inside
my
cochlea
damn
i
said
i
got
a
call
tell
them
you
busy
she
said
i
will
i
said
and
answered
the
call
subvocally
julius
here
hi
julius
it
dan
you
got
a
minute
i
knew
a
thousand
dans
but
i
recognized
the
voice
immediately
though
it
been
ten
years
since
we
last
got
drunk
at
the
gazoo
together
i
muted
the
subvocal
and
said
lil
i
got
to
take

at
all
she
sarcased
at
me
she
sat
up
and

out
her
crack
pipe
and
lit
up
dan
i
subvocalized
long
time
no

he
said
and
his
voice
cracked
on
a
sob
i
turned
and
gave
lil
such
a
look
she
dropped
her
pipe
how
can
i
help
she
said
softly
but
swiftly
i
waved
her
off
and
switched
the
phone
to
mode
my
voice
sounded
unnaturally
loud
in
the
calm
where
you
at
dan
i
asked
down
here
in
orlando
i
stuck
out
on
pleasure
island
all
right
i
said

me
at
uh
the
adventurer
club
upstairs
on
the
couch
by
the
door
i
be
there
in
i
shot
a
look
at
lil
who
knew
the
roads
better
than
i
she
flashed
ten
fingers
at
me
ten
minutes
okay
he
said
sorry
he
had
his
voice
back
under
control
i
switched
off
what
up
lil
asked
i
not
sure
an
old
friend
is
in
town
he
sounds
like
he
got
a
problem
lil
pointed
a
finger
at
me
and
made
a
gesture
there
she
said
i
just
dumped
the
best
route
to
pleasure
island
to
your
public
directory
keep
me
in
the
loop
okay
i
set
off
for
the
utilidoor
entrance
near
the
hall
of
presidents
and
booted
down
the
stairs
to
the
hum
of
the
underground
i
took
the
slidewalk
to
cast
parking
and
zipped
my
little
cart
out
to
pleasure
island
i
found
dan
sitting
on
the
couch
underneath
rows
of
trophy
shots
with
humorous
captions
downstairs
castmembers
were
working
the
animatronic
masks
and
idols
chattering
with
the
guests
dan
was
apparent
fifty
plus
a
little
paunchy
and
stubbled
he
had
bags
under
his
eyes
and
he
slumped
listlessly
as
i
approached
i
pinged
his
whuffie
and
was
startled
to
see
that
it
had
dropped
to
nearly
zero
jesus
i
said
as
i
sat
down
next
to
him
you
look
like
hell
dan
he
nodded
appearances
can
be
deceptive
he
said
but
in
this
case
they
you
want
to
talk
about
it
i
asked
somewhere
else
huh
i
hear
they
ring
in
the
new
year
every
night
at
midnight
i
think
that
be
a
little
too
much
for
me
right
now
i
led
him
out
to
my
cart
and
cruised
back
to
the
place
i
shared
with
lil
out
in
kissimmee
he
smoked
eight
cigarettes
on
the
twenty
minute
ride
hammering
one
after
another
into
his
mouth
filling
my
runabout
with
stinging
clouds
i
kept
glancing
at
him
in
the
he
had
his
eyes
closed
and
in
repose
he
looked
dead
i
could
hardly
believe
that
this
was
my
vibrant
pal
of
yore
surreptitiously
i
called
lil
phone
i
bringing
him
home
i
subvocalized
he
in
rough
shape
not
sure
what
it
all
about
i
make
up
the
couch
she
said
and
get
some
coffee
together
love
you
back
atcha
kid
i
said
as
we
approached
the
tacky
little
swaybacked
he
opened
his
eyes
you
a
pal
jules
i
waved
him
off
no
really
i
tried
to
think
of
who
i
could
call
and
you
were
the
only
one
i
missed
you
bud
lil
said
she
put
some
coffee
on
i
said
you
sound
like
you
need
it
lil
was
waiting
on
the
sofa
a
folded
blanket
and
an
extra
pillow
on
the
side
table
a
pot
of
coffee
and
some
disneyland
beijing
mugs
beside
them
she
stood
and
extended
her
hand
i
lil
she
said
dan
he
said
it
a
pleasure
i
knew
she
was
pinging
his
whuffie
and
i
caught
her
look
of
surprised
disapproval
us
oldsters
who
predate
whuffie
know
that
it
important
but
to
the
kids
it
the
someone
without
any
is
automatically
suspect
i
watched
her
recover
quickly
smile
and
surreptitiously
wipe
her
hand
on
her
jeans
coffee
she
said
oh
yeah
dan
said
and
slumped
on
the
sofa
she
poured
him
a
cup
and
set
it
on
a
coaster
on
the
coffee
table
let
you
boys
catch
up
then
she
said
and
started
for
the
bedroom
no
dan
said
wait
if
you
do
mind
i
think
it
help
if
i
could
talk
to
someone
younger
too
she
set
her
face
in
the
look
of
chirpy
helpfulness
that
all
the
gen
castmembers
have
at
their
instant
disposal
and
settled
into
an
armchair
she
pulled
out
her
pipe
and
lit
a
rock
i
went
through
my
crack
period
before
she
was
born
just
after
they
made
it
decaf
and
i
always
felt
old
when
i
saw
her
and
her
friends
light
up
dan
surprised
me
by
holding
out
a
hand
to
her
and
taking
the
pipe
he
toked
heavily
then
passed
it
back
dan
closed
his
eyes
again
then
ground
his
fists
into
them
sipped
his
coffee
it
was
clear
he
was
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
start
i
believed
that
i
was
braver
than
i
really
am
is
what
it
boils
down
to
he
said
who
does
i
said
i
really
thought
i
could
do
it
i
knew
that
someday
i
run
out
of
things
to
do
things
to
see
i
knew
that
i
finish
some
day
you
remember
we
used
to
argue
about
it
i
swore
i
be
done
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
and
now
i
am
there
is
a
single
place
left
that
is
part
of
the
bitchun
society
there
is
a
single
thing
left
that
i
want
any
part
of
so
deadhead
for
a
few
centuries
i
said
put
the
decision
off
no
he
shouted
startling
both
of
us
i
it
so
do
it
lil
said
i
he
sobbed
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
cried
like
a
baby
in
great
snoring
sobs
that
shook
his
whole
body
lil
went
into
the
kitchen
and
got
some
tissue
and
passed
it
to
me
i
sat
alongside
him
and
awkwardly
patted
his
back
jesus
he
said
into
his
palms
jesus
dan
i
said
quietly
he
sat
up
and
took
the
tissue
wiped
off
his
face
and
hands
thanks
he
said
i
tried
to
make
a
go
of
it
really
i
have
i
spent
the
last
eight
years
in
istanbul
writing
papers
on
my
missions
about
the
communities
i
did
some
followup
studies
interviews
no
one
was
interested
not
even
me
i
smoked
a
lot
of
hash
it
did
help
so
one
morning
i
woke
up
and
went
to
the
bazaar
and
said
good
bye
to
the
friends
i
made
there
then
i
went
to
a
pharmacy
and
had
the
man
make
me
up
a
lethal
injection
he
wished
me
good
luck
and
i
went
back
to
my
rooms
i
sat
there
with
the
hypo
all
afternoon
then
i
decided
to
sleep
on
it
and
i
got
up
the
next
morning
and
did
it
all
over
again
i
looked
inside
myself
and
i
saw
that
i
did
have
the
guts
i
just
did
have
the
guts
i
stared
down
the
barrels
of
a
hundred
guns
had
a
thousand
knives
pressed
up
against
my
throat
but
i
did
have
the
guts
to
press
that
button
you
were
too
late
lil
said
we
both
turned
to
look
at
her
you
were
a
decade
too
late
look
at
you
you
pathetic
if
you
killed
yourself
right
now
you
just
be
a
loser
who
could
hack
it
if
you
done
it
ten
years
earlier
you
would
been
going
out
on
top
a
champion
retiring
permanently
she
set
her
mug
down
with
a
clunk
sometimes
lil
and
i
are
right
on
the
same
wavelength
sometimes
like
she
on
a
different
planet
all
i
could
do
was
sit
there
horrified
and
she
was
happy
to
discuss
the
timing
of
my
pal
suicide
but
she
was
right
dan
nodded
heavily
and
i
saw
that
he
knew
it
too
a
day
late
and
a
dollar
short
he
sighed
well
do
just
sit
there
she
said
you
know
what
you
got
to
do
what
i
said
involuntarily
irritated
by
her
tone
she
looked
at
me
like
i
was
being
deliberately
stupid
he
got
to
get
back
on
top
cleaned
up
dried
out
into
some
productive
work
get
that
whuffie
up
too
he
can
kill
himself
with
dignity
it
was
the
stupidest
thing
i
ever
heard
dan
though
was
cocking
an
eyebrow
at
her
and
thinking
hard
how
old
did
you
say
you
were
he
asked
she
said
wish
i
had
your
smarts
at
he
said
and
heaved
a
sigh
straightening
up
can
i
stay
here
while
i
get
the
job
done
i
looked
askance
at
lil
who
considered
for
a
moment
then
nodded
sure
pal
sure
i
said
i
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
you
look
beat
beat
does
begin
to
cover
it
he
said
good
night
then
i
said
chapter
works
well
for
the
most
part
lil
folks
had
taken
over
the
running
of
liberty
square
with
a
group
of
other
interested
compatible
souls
they
did
a
fine
job
racked
up
gobs
of
whuffie
and
anyone
who
came
around
and
tried
to
take
it
over
would
be
so
reviled
by
the
guests
they
would
find
a
pot
to
piss
in
or
they
have
such
a
wicked
radical
approach
that
they
ouster
lil
parents
and
their
pals
and
do
a
better
job
it
can
break
down
though
there
were
pretenders
to
the
throne
a
group
who
worked
with
the
original
and
then
had
moved
off
to
other
pursuits
some
of
them
had
gone
to
school
some
of
them
had
made
movies
written
books
or
gone
off
to
disneyland
beijing
to
help
start
things
up
a
few
had
deadheaded
for
a
couple
decades
they
came
back
to
liberty
square
with
a
message
update
the
attractions
the
liberty
square
were
the
staunchest
conservatives
in
the
magic
kingdom
preserving
the
wheezing
technology
in
the
face
of
a
park
that
changed
almost
daily
the
were
with
the
rest
of
the
park
had
their
support
and
looked
like
they
might
make
a
successful
go
of
it
so
it
fell
to
lil
to
make
sure
that
there
were
no
bugs
in
the
meager
attractions
of
liberty
square
the
hall
of
the
presidents
the
liberty
belle
riverboat
and
the
glorious
haunted
mansion
arguably
the
coolest
attraction
to
come
from
the
fevered
minds
of
the
disney
imagineers
i
caught
her
backstage
at
the
hall
of
the
presidents
tinkering
with
lincoln
ii
the
backup
animatronic
lil
tried
to
keep
two
of
everything
running
at
speed
just
in
case
she
could
swap
out
a
dead
bot
for
a
backup
in
five
minutes
flat
which
is
all
that
would
permit
it
had
been
two
weeks
since
dan
arrival
and
though
i
barely
seen
him
in
that
time
his
presence
was
vivid
in
our
lives
our
little
house
had
a
new
smell
not
unpleasant
of
rejuve
and
hope
and
loss
something
barely
noticeable
over
the
tropical
flowers
nodding
in
front
of
our
porch
my
phone
rang
three
or
four
times
a
day
dan
checking
in
from
his
rounds
of
the
park
seeking
out
some
way
to
accumulate
personal
capital
his
excitement
and
dedication
to
the
task
were
inspiring
pulling
me
into
his
mode
of
being
you
just
missed
dan
she
said
she
had
her
head
in
lincoln
chest
working
with
an
autosolder
and
a
magnifier
bent
over
red
hair
tied
back
in
a
neat
bun
sweat
sheening
her
wiry
freckled
arms
smelling
of
and
machine
lubricant
she
made
me
wish
there
were
a
mattress
somewhere
backstage
i
settled
for
patting
her
behind
affectionately
and
she
wriggled
appreciatively
he
looking
better
his
rejuve
had
taken
him
back
to
apparent
the
way
i
remembered
him
he
was
rawboned
and
leathery
but
still
had
the
defeated
stoop
that
had
startled
me
when
i
saw
him
at
the
adventurer
club
what
did
he
want
he
been
hanging
out
with
debra
he
wanted
to
make
sure
i
knew
what
she
up
to
debra
was
one
of
the
old
guard
a
former
comrade
of
lil
parents
spent
a
decade
in
disneyland
beijing
coding
if
she
had
her
way
we
tear
down
every
marvelous
rube
goldberg
in
the
park
and
replace
them
with
pristine
white
sim
boxes
on
giant
articulated
servos
the
problem
was
that
she
was
at
coding
sims
her
great
movie
ride
rehab
at
mgm
was
breathtaking
the
star
wars
sequence
had
already
inspired
a
hundred
that
fielded
millions
of
hits
she
leveraged
her
success
into
a
deal
with
the
adventureland
to
rehab
the
pirates
of
the
caribbean
and
their
backstage
areas
were
piled
high
with
reference
treasure
chests
and
cutlasses
and
bowsprits
it
was
terrifying
to
walk
through
the
pirates
was
the
last
ride
walt
personally
supervised
and
we
thought
it
was
sacrosanct
but
debra
had
built
a
pirates
sim
in
beijing
based
on
chend
i
sao
the
xixth
century
chinese
pirate
queen
which
was
credited
with
rescuing
the
park
from
obscurity
and
ruin
the
florida
iteration
would
incorporate
the
best
aspects
of
its
chinese
cousin
the
sims
that
communicated
with
each
other
and
with
the
guests
greeting
them
by
name
each
time
they
rode
and
spinning
tales
of
piracy
on
the
high
seas
the
spectacular
of
the
aquatic
necropolis
of
rotting
junks
on
the
the
thrilling
pitch
and
yaw
of
the
sim
as
it
weathered
a
violent
storm
but
with
western
themes
wafts
of
jamaican
pepper
sauce
crackling
through
the
air
liquid
accents
and
swordfights
conducted
in
the
manner
of
the
pirates
who
plied
the
blue
waters
of
the
new
world
identical
sims
would
stack
like
cordwood
in
the
space
currently
occupied
by
the
bulky
and
dioramas
quintupling
capacity
and
halving
so
what
she
up
to
lil
extracted
herself
from
the
mechanical
guts
and
made
a
comical
moue
of
worry
she
rehabbing
the
pirates
and
doing
an
incredible
job
they
ahead
of
schedule
they
got
good
the
focus
groups
are
cumming
themselves
the
comedy
went
out
of
her
expression
baring
genuine
worry
she
turned
away
and
closed
up
honest
abe
then
fired
her
finger
at
him
smoothly
he
began
to
run
through
his
spiel
silent
but
for
the
soft
hum
and
whine
of
his
servos
lil
mimed
twiddling
a
knob
and
his
audiotrack
kicked
in
low
all
the
armies
of
europe
asia
and
africa
could
not
by
force
make
a
track
on
the
blue
ridge
nor
take
a
drink
from
the
ohio
if
destruction
be
our
lot
then
we
ourselves
must
be
its
author
and
its
finisher
she
mimed
turning
down
the
gain
and
he
fell
silent
again
you
said
it
president
she
said
and
fired
her
finger
at
him
again
powering
him
down
she
bent
and
adjusted
his
period
topcoat
then
carefully
wound
and
set
the
in
his
pocket
i
put
my
arm
around
her
shoulders
you
doing
all
you
can
and
good
work
i
said
i
fallen
into
the
easy
castmember
mode
of
speaking
voicing
bland
affirmations
hearing
the
words
i
felt
a
flush
of
embarrassment
i
pulled
her
into
a
long
hard
hug
and
fumbled
for
better
reassurance
finding
no
words
that
would
do
i
gave
her
a
final
squeeze
and
let
her
go
she
looked
at
me
sidelong
and
nodded
her
head
it
be
fine
of
course
she
said
i
mean
the
worst
possible
scenario
is
that
debra
will
do
her
job
very
very
well
and
make
things
even
better
than
they
are
now
that
not
so
bad
this
was
a
reversal
of
her
position
on
the
subject
the
last
time
we
talked
but
you
do
live
more
than
a
century
without
learning
when
to
point
out
that
sort
of
thing
and
when
not
to
my
cochlea
struck
twelve
noon
and
a
hud
appeared
with
my
weekly
backup
reminder
lil
was
maneuvering
ben
franklin
ii
out
of
his
niche
i
waved
at
her
back
and
walked
away
to
an
uplink
terminal
once
i
was
close
enough
for
secure
broadband
communications
i
got
ready
to
back
up
my
cochlea
chimed
again
and
i
answered
it
yes
i
subvocalized
impatiently
i
hated
getting
distracted
from
a
backup
one
of
my
enduring
fears
was
that
i
forget
the
backup
altogether
and
leave
myself
vulnerable
for
an
entire
week
until
the
next
reminder
i
lost
the
knack
of
getting
into
habits
in
my
adolescence
giving
in
completely
to
reminders
over
conscious
choice
it
dan
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
park
in
full
swing
behind
him
children
laughter
bright
recorded
animatronic
spiels
the
tromp
of
thousands
of
feet
can
you
meet
me
at
the
tiki
room
it
pretty
important
can
it
wait
for
fifteen
i
asked
sure
see
you
in
fifteen
i
rung
off
and
initiated
the
backup
a
zipped
across
a
hud
dumping
the
parts
of
my
memory
that
were
purely
digital
then
it
finished
and
started
in
on
organic
memory
my
eyes
rolled
back
in
my
head
and
my
life
flashed
before
my
eyes
chapter
the
bitchun
society
has
had
much
experience
with
restores
from
backup
in
the
era
of
the
cure
for
death
people
live
pretty
recklessly
some
people
get
refreshed
a
couple
dozen
times
a
year
not
me
i
hate
the
process
not
so
much
that
i
wo
participate
in
it
everyone
who
had
serious
philosophical
conundra
on
that
subject
just
you
know
a
generation
before
the
bitchun
society
did
need
to
convert
its
detractors
just
outlive
them
the
first
time
i
died
it
was
not
long
after
my
sixtieth
birthday
i
was
scuba
diving
at
playa
coral
near
veradero
cuba
of
course
i
remember
the
incident
but
knowing
my
habits
at
that
particular
site
and
having
read
the
of
my
reconstructed
the
events
i
was
eeling
my
way
through
the
with
a
borrowed
bottle
and
mask
i
also
borrowed
a
wetsuit
but
i
was
wearing
it
the
salt
water
was
balm
and
i
hated
erecting
barriers
between
it
and
my
skin
the
caves
were
made
of
coral
and
rocks
and
they
coiled
and
twisted
like
intestines
through
each
hole
and
around
each
corner
there
was
a
hollow
rough
sphere
of
surpassing
alien
beauty
giant
lobsters
skittered
over
the
walls
and
through
the
holes
schools
of
fish
as
bright
as
jewels
darted
and
executed
precision
maneuvers
as
i
disturbed
their
busy
days
i
do
some
of
my
best
thinking
under
water
and
i
often
slipping
off
into
dangerous
reverie
at
depth
normally
my
diving
buddies
ensure
that
i
do
hurt
myself
but
this
time
i
got
away
from
them
spidering
forward
into
a
tiny
hole
where
i
got
stuck
my
diving
buddies
were
behind
me
and
i
rapped
on
my
bottle
with
the
hilt
of
my
knife
until
one
of
them
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
my
buddies
saw
what
was
up
and
attempted
to
pull
me
loose
but
my
bottle
and
vest
were
firmly
wedged
the
others
exchanged
hand
signals
silently
debating
the
best
way
to
get
me
loose
suddenly
i
was
thrashing
and
kicking
and
then
i
disappeared
into
the
cave
minus
my
vest
and
bottle
i
apparently
attempted
to
cut
through
my
straps
and
managed
to
sever
the
tube
of
my
regulator
after
inhaling
a
jolt
of
sea
water
i
thrashed
free
into
the
cave
rolling
into
a
monstrous
patch
of
spindly
i
inhaled
another
lungful
of
water
and
kicked
madly
for
a
tiny
hole
in
the
cave
ceiling
whence
my
buddies
retrieved
me
shortly
thereafter
except
for
the
patchy
red
welts
from
the
stinging
coral
in
those
days
making
a
backup
was
a
lot
more
complicated
the
procedure
took
most
of
a
day
and
had
to
be
undertaken
at
a
special
clinic
luckily
i
had
one
made
just
before
i
left
for
cuba
a
few
weeks
earlier
my
backup
was
three
years
old
dating
from
the
completion
of
my
second
symphony
they
recovered
me
from
backup
and
into
a
clone
at
toronto
general
as
far
as
i
knew
i
laid
down
in
the
backup
clinic
one
moment
and
arisen
the
next
it
took
most
of
a
year
to
get
over
the
feeling
that
the
whole
world
was
putting
a
monstrous
joke
over
on
me
that
the
drowned
corpse
i
seen
was
indeed
my
own
in
my
mind
the
rebirth
was
figurative
as
well
as
literal
the
missing
time
was
enough
that
i
found
myself
to
socialize
with
my
friends
i
told
dan
the
story
during
our
first
friendship
and
he
immediately
pounced
on
the
fact
that
i
gone
to
disney
world
to
spend
a
week
sorting
out
my
feelings
reinventing
myself
moving
to
space
marrying
a
crazy
lady
he
found
it
very
curious
that
i
always
rebooted
myself
at
disney
world
when
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
to
live
there
someday
he
asked
me
if
that
would
mean
that
i
was
done
reinventing
myself
sometimes
as
i
ran
my
fingers
through
lil
sweet
red
curls
i
thought
of
that
remark
and
sighed
great
gusts
of
contentment
and
marveled
that
my
friend
dan
had
been
so
prescient
the
next
time
i
died
they
improved
the
technology
somewhat
i
had
a
massive
stroke
in
my
year
collapsing
on
the
ice
in
the
middle
of
a
hockey
game
by
the
time
they
cut
my
helmet
away
the
hematomae
had
crushed
my
brain
into
a
pulpy
mess
i
been
lax
in
backing
up
and
i
lost
most
of
a
year
but
they
woke
me
gently
with
a
precis
of
the
events
of
the
missing
interval
and
a
counselor
contacted
me
daily
for
a
year
until
i
felt
at
home
again
in
my
skin
again
my
life
rebooted
and
i
found
myself
in
disney
world
methodically
flensing
away
the
relationships
built
and
starting
afresh
in
boston
living
on
the
ocean
floor
and
working
the
harvesters
a
project
that
led
eventually
to
my
chem
thesis
at
u
of
after
i
was
shot
dead
at
the
tiki
room
i
had
the
opportunity
to
appreciate
the
great
leaps
that
restores
had
made
in
the
intervening
ten
years
i
woke
in
my
own
bed
instantly
aware
of
the
events
that
led
up
to
my
third
death
as
seen
from
various
povs
security
footage
from
the
adventureland
cameras
synthesized
memories
extracted
from
dan
own
backup
and
a
of
the
scene
i
woke
feeling
preternaturally
calm
and
cheerful
and
knowing
that
i
felt
that
way
because
of
certain
temporary
neurotransmitter
presets
that
had
been
put
in
place
when
i
was
restored
dan
and
lil
sat
at
my
bedside
lil
tired
smiling
face
was
limned
with
hairs
that
had
snuck
loose
of
her
ponytail
she
took
my
hand
and
kissed
the
smooth
knuckles
dan
smiled
beneficently
at
me
and
i
was
seized
with
a
warm
comforting
feeling
of
being
surrounded
by
people
who
really
loved
me
i
dug
for
words
appropriate
to
the
scene
decided
to
wing
it
opened
my
mouth
and
said
to
my
surprise
i
have
to
pee
dan
and
lil
smiled
at
each
other
i
lurched
out
of
the
bed
naked
and
thumped
to
the
bathroom
my
muscles
were
wonderfully
limber
with
a
spring
to
them
after
i
flushed
i
leaned
over
and
took
hold
of
my
ankles
then
pulled
my
head
right
to
the
floor
feeling
the
marvelous
flexibility
of
my
back
and
legs
and
buttocks
a
scar
on
my
knee
was
missing
as
were
the
many
lines
that
had
crisscrossed
my
fingers
when
i
looked
in
the
mirror
i
saw
that
my
nose
and
earlobes
were
smaller
and
perkier
the
familiar
and
the
between
my
eyebrows
were
gone
i
had
a
day
beard
all
over
head
face
pubis
arms
legs
i
ran
my
hands
over
my
body
and
chuckled
at
the
ticklish
newness
of
it
all
i
was
briefly
tempted
to
depilate
all
over
just
to
keep
this
feeling
of
newness
forever
but
the
neurotransmitter
presets
were
evaporating
and
a
sense
of
urgency
over
my
murder
was
creeping
up
on
me
i
tied
a
towel
around
my
waist
and
made
my
way
back
to
the
bedroom
the
smells
of
and
flowers
and
rejuve
were
bright
in
my
nose
effervescent
as
camphor
dan
and
lil
stood
when
i
came
into
the
room
and
helped
me
to
the
bed
well
this
i
said
i
gone
straight
from
the
uplink
through
the
utilidors
three
quick
cuts
of
security
cam
footage
one
at
the
uplink
one
in
the
corridor
and
one
at
the
exit
in
the
underpass
between
liberty
square
and
adventureland
i
seemed
bemused
and
a
little
sad
as
i
emerged
from
the
door
and
began
to
weave
my
way
through
the
crowd
using
a
kind
of
sinuous
darting
shuffle
that
i
developed
when
i
was
doing
on
my
thesis
i
cut
rapidly
through
the
lunchtime
crowd
toward
the
long
roof
of
the
tiki
room
thatched
with
strips
of
shimmering
aluminum
cut
and
painted
to
look
like
long
grass
fuzzy
shots
now
from
dan
pov
of
me
moving
closer
to
him
passing
close
to
a
group
of
teenaged
girls
with
extra
elbows
and
knees
wearing
environmentally
controlled
cloaks
and
cowls
covered
with
epcot
center
logomarks
one
of
them
is
wearing
a
pith
helmet
from
the
jungle
traders
shop
outside
of
the
jungle
cruise
dan
gaze
flicks
away
to
the
tiki
room
entrance
where
there
is
a
short
queue
of
older
men
then
back
just
as
the
girl
with
the
pith
helmet
draws
a
stylish
little
organic
pistol
like
a
penis
with
a
tail
that
coils
around
her
arm
casually
grinning
she
raises
her
arm
and
gestures
with
the
pistol
exactly
like
lil
does
with
her
finger
when
she
uploading
and
the
pistol
lunges
forward
dan
gaze
flicks
back
to
me
i
pitching
over
my
lungs
bursting
out
of
my
chest
and
spreading
before
me
like
wings
spinal
gristle
and
viscera
showering
the
guests
before
me
a
piece
of
my
nametag
now
shrapnel
strikes
dan
in
the
forehead
causing
him
to
blink
when
he
looks
again
the
group
of
girls
is
still
there
but
the
girl
with
the
pistol
is
long
gone
the
is
far
less
confused
everyone
except
me
dan
and
the
girl
is
we
limned
in
highlighter
yellow
moving
in
motion
i
emerge
from
the
underpass
and
the
girl
moves
from
the
swiss
family
robinson
treehouse
to
the
group
of
her
friends
dan
starts
to
move
towards
me
the
girl
raises
arms
and
fires
her
pistol
the
guiding
keyed
to
my
body
chemistry
flies
low
near
ground
level
weaving
between
the
feet
of
the
crowd
moving
just
below
the
speed
of
sound
when
it
reaches
me
it
screams
upwards
and
into
my
spine
detonating
once
it
entered
my
chest
cavity
the
girl
has
already
made
a
lot
of
ground
back
toward
the
street
usa
gateway
the
speeds
up
following
her
as
she
merges
with
the
crowds
on
the
street
ducking
and
weaving
between
them
moving
toward
the
breezeway
at
sleeping
beauty
castle
she
vanishes
then
reappears
forty
minutes
later
in
tomorrowland
near
the
new
space
mountain
complex
then
disappears
again
has
anyone
id
the
girl
i
asked
once
i
finished
reliving
the
events
the
anger
was
starting
to
boil
within
me
now
my
new
fists
clenched
for
the
first
time
soft
palms
and
uncallused
fingertips
dan
shook
his
head
none
of
the
girls
she
was
with
had
ever
seen
her
before
the
face
was
one
of
the
seven
sisters
hope
the
seven
sisters
were
a
trendy
collection
of
designer
faces
every
second
teenage
girl
wore
one
of
them
how
about
jungle
traders
i
asked
did
they
have
a
record
of
the
pith
helmet
purchase
lil
frowned
we
ran
the
jungle
traders
purchases
back
for
six
months
only
three
matched
the
girl
apparent
age
all
three
have
alibis
chances
are
she
stole
it
why
i
asked
finally
in
my
mind
eye
i
saw
my
lungs
bursting
out
of
my
chest
like
wings
like
jellyfish
vertebrae
spraying
like
shrapnel
i
saw
the
girl
smile
an
almost
sexual
smirk
as
she
pulled
the
trigger
on
me
it
was
random
lil
said
the
slug
was
definitely
keyed
to
you
that
means
that
she
gotten
close
to
you
at
some
point
right
which
meant
that
she
been
to
disney
world
in
the
last
ten
years
that
narrowed
it
down
all
right
what
happened
to
her
after
tomorrowland
i
said
we
do
know
lil
said
something
wrong
with
the
cameras
we
lost
her
and
she
never
reappeared
she
sounded
hot
and
angry
she
took
equipment
failures
in
the
magic
kingdom
personally
who
want
to
do
this
i
asked
hating
the
in
my
voice
it
was
the
first
time
i
been
murdered
but
i
did
need
to
be
a
queen
about
it
dan
eyes
got
a
look
sometimes
people
do
things
for
reasons
that
seem
perfectly
reasonable
to
them
that
the
rest
of
the
world
could
hope
to
understand
i
seen
a
few
assassinations
and
they
never
made
sense
afterwards
he
stroked
his
chin
sometimes
better
to
look
for
temperament
rather
than
motivation
who
do
something
like
this
right
all
we
needed
to
do
was
investigate
all
the
psychopaths
visited
the
magic
kingdom
in
ten
years
that
narrowed
it
down
considerably
i
pulled
up
a
hud
and
checked
the
time
it
had
been
four
days
since
my
murder
i
had
a
shift
coming
up
working
the
turnstiles
at
the
haunted
mansion
i
liked
to
pull
a
couple
of
those
shifts
a
month
just
to
keep
myself
grounded
it
helped
to
take
a
reality
check
while
i
was
churning
away
in
the
rarified
climate
of
my
simulations
i
stood
and
went
to
my
closet
started
to
dress
are
you
doing
lil
asked
alarmed
i
got
a
shift
i
running
late
you
in
no
shape
to
work
lil
said
tugging
at
my
elbow
i
jerked
free
of
her
i
fine
good
as
new
i
barked
a
humorless
laugh
i
not
going
to
let
those
bastards
disrupt
my
life
any
more
i
thought
when
had
i
decided
that
there
was
more
than
one
but
i
knew
it
was
true
there
was
no
way
that
this
was
all
planned
by
one
person
it
had
been
executed
too
precisely
too
thoroughly
dan
moved
to
block
the
bedroom
door
wait
a
second
he
said
you
need
rest
i
fixed
him
with
a
doleful
glare
i
decide
that
i
said
he
stepped
aside
i
tag
along
then
he
said
just
in
case
i
pinged
my
whuffie
i
was
up
a
couple
percentiles
sympathy
whuffie
but
it
was
falling
dan
and
lil
were
radiating
disapproval
screw
i
got
into
my
runabout
and
dan
scrambled
for
the
passenger
door
as
i
put
it
in
gear
and
sped
out
are
you
sure
you
all
right
dan
said
as
i
nearly
rolled
the
runabout
taking
the
corner
at
the
end
of
our
why
would
i
be
i
said
i
as
good
as
new
funny
choice
of
words
he
said
some
would
say
that
you
new
i
groaned
not
this
argument
again
i
said
i
feel
like
me
and
no
one
else
is
making
that
claim
who
cares
if
i
been
restored
from
a
backup
all
i
saying
is
there
a
difference
between
and
an
exact
copy
of
you
is
there
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
distracting
me
with
one
of
our
old
fights
but
i
could
resist
the
bait
and
as
i
marshalled
my
arguments
it
actually
helped
calm
me
down
some
dan
was
that
kind
of
friend
a
person
who
knew
you
better
than
you
knew
yourself
so
you
saying
that
if
you
were
obliterated
and
then
recreated
that
you
would
be
you
anymore
for
the
sake
of
argument
sure
being
destroyed
and
recreated
is
different
from
not
being
destroyed
at
all
right
brush
up
on
your
quantum
mechanics
pal
you
being
destroyed
and
recreated
a
trillion
times
a
second
on
a
very
very
small
level
what
difference
does
that
make
fine
i
concede
that
but
you
not
really
an
copy
you
a
clone
with
a
copied
that
not
the
same
as
quantum
destruction
very
nice
thing
to
say
to
someone
who
just
been
murdered
pal
you
got
a
problem
with
clones
and
we
were
off
and
running
the
mansion
cast
were
sickeningly
cheerful
and
solicitous
each
of
them
made
a
point
of
coming
around
and
touching
the
stiff
starched
shoulder
of
my
butler
costume
letting
me
know
that
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
for
me
i
gave
them
all
a
fixed
smile
and
tried
to
concentrate
on
the
guests
how
they
waited
when
they
arrived
how
they
dispersed
through
the
exit
gate
dan
hovered
nearby
occasionally
taking
the
eight
minute
second
running
interference
for
me
with
the
other
castmembers
he
was
nearby
when
my
break
came
up
i
changed
into
civvies
and
we
walked
over
the
cobbled
streets
past
the
hall
of
the
presidents
noting
as
i
rounded
the
corner
that
there
was
something
different
about
the
dan
groaned
they
did
it
already
he
said
i
looked
closer
the
turnstiles
were
blocked
by
a
sandwich
board
mickey
in
a
ben
franklin
wig
and
bifocals
holding
a
trowel
excuse
our
mess
the
sign
declared
we
renovating
to
serve
you
better
i
spotted
one
of
debra
cronies
standing
behind
the
sign
a
satisfied
smile
on
his
face
he
started
off
life
as
a
squat
northern
chinese
but
had
had
his
bones
lengthened
and
his
cheekbones
raised
so
that
he
looked
almost
elfin
i
took
one
look
at
his
smile
and
understood
debra
had
established
a
toehold
in
liberty
square
they
filed
plans
for
the
new
hall
with
the
steering
committee
an
hour
after
you
got
shot
the
committee
loved
the
plans
so
did
the
net
they
promising
not
to
touch
the
mansion
you
did
mention
this
i
said
hotly
we
thought
you
jump
to
conclusions
the
timing
was
bad
but
no
indication
that
they
arranged
for
the
shooter
everyone
got
an
alibi
furthermore
they
all
offered
to
submit
their
backups
for
proof
right
i
said
right
so
they
just
to
have
plans
for
a
new
hall
standing
by
and
they
just
to
file
them
after
i
got
shot
when
all
our
were
busy
worrying
about
me
it
all
a
big
coincidence
dan
shook
his
head
we
not
stupid
jules
no
one
thinks
that
it
a
coincidence
debra
the
sort
of
person
who
keeps
a
lot
of
plans
standing
by
just
in
case
but
that
just
makes
her
a
opportunist
not
a
murderer
i
felt
nauseated
and
exhausted
i
was
enough
of
a
castmember
that
i
sought
out
a
utilidor
before
i
collapsed
against
a
wall
head
down
defeat
seeped
through
me
saturating
me
dan
crouched
down
beside
me
i
looked
over
at
him
he
was
grinning
wryly
posit
he
said
for
the
moment
that
debra
really
did
do
this
thing
set
you
up
so
that
she
could
take
over
i
smiled
in
spite
of
myself
this
was
his
explaining
act
the
thing
he
would
do
whenever
i
fell
into
one
of
his
rhetorical
tricks
back
in
the
old
days
all
right
i
posited
it
why
would
she
one
take
out
you
instead
of
lil
or
one
of
the
real
timers
two
go
after
the
hall
of
presidents
instead
of
tom
sawyer
island
or
even
the
mansion
and
three
follow
it
up
with
such
a
blatant
suspicious
move
all
right
i
said
warming
to
the
challenge
one
i
important
enough
to
be
disruptive
but
not
so
important
as
to
rate
a
full
investigation
two
tom
sawyer
island
is
too
visible
you
ca
rehab
it
without
people
seeing
the
dust
from
shore
three
debra
coming
off
of
a
decade
in
beijing
where
subtlety
is
real
important
sure
dan
said
sure
then
he
launched
an
answering
salvo
and
while
i
was
thinking
up
my
answer
he
helped
me
to
my
feet
and
walked
me
out
to
my
runabout
arguing
all
the
way
so
that
by
the
time
i
noticed
we
were
at
the
park
anymore
i
was
home
and
in
bed
with
all
the
hall
animatronics
mothballed
for
the
duration
lil
had
more
time
on
her
hands
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
she
hung
around
the
little
bungalow
the
two
of
us
in
the
living
room
staring
blankly
at
the
windows
breathing
shallowly
in
the
claustrophobic
superheated
florida
air
i
had
my
working
notes
on
queue
management
for
the
mansion
and
i
pecked
at
them
aimlessly
sometimes
lil
mirrored
my
hud
so
she
could
watch
me
work
and
made
suggestions
based
on
her
long
experience
it
was
a
delicate
process
this
business
of
increasing
throughput
without
harming
the
guest
experience
but
for
every
second
i
could
shave
off
of
the
time
i
could
put
another
sixty
guests
through
and
lop
thirty
seconds
off
total
and
the
more
guests
who
got
to
experience
the
mansion
the
more
of
a
debra
people
would
suffer
if
they
made
a
move
on
it
so
i
dutifully
pecked
at
my
notes
and
found
three
seconds
i
could
shave
off
the
graveyard
sequence
by
swiveling
the
doom
buggy
carriages
as
they
descended
from
the
attic
window
by
expanding
their
i
could
expose
the
guests
to
all
the
scenes
more
quickly
i
ran
the
change
in
then
implemented
it
after
closing
and
invited
the
other
liberty
square
to
come
and
test
it
out
it
was
another
muggy
winter
evening
prematurely
dark
the
had
enough
friends
and
family
with
them
that
we
were
able
to
simulate
an
and
we
all
stood
and
sweated
in
the
preshow
area
waiting
for
the
doors
to
swing
open
listening
to
the
and
assorted
from
the
hidden
speakers
the
doors
swung
open
revealing
lil
in
a
rotting
maid
uniform
her
eyes
lined
with
black
her
skin
powdered
to
a
deathly
pallor
she
gave
us
a
cold
considering
glare
then
intoned
master
gracey
requests
more
bodies
as
we
crowded
into
the
cool
musty
gloom
of
the
parlor
lil
contrived
to
give
my
ass
an
affectionate
squeeze
i
turned
to
return
the
favor
and
saw
debra
elfin
comrade
looming
over
lil
shoulder
my
smile
died
on
my
lips
the
man
locked
eyes
with
me
for
a
moment
and
i
saw
something
in
there
some
admixture
of
cruelty
and
worry
that
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
he
looked
away
immediately
i
known
that
debra
would
have
spies
in
the
crowd
of
course
but
with
watching
i
resolved
to
make
this
the
best
show
i
knew
how
it
subtle
this
business
of
making
the
show
better
from
within
lil
had
already
slid
aside
the
paneled
wall
that
led
to
number
two
the
most
recently
serviced
one
once
the
crowd
had
moved
inside
i
tried
to
lead
their
eyes
by
adjusting
my
body
language
to
poses
of
subtle
attention
directed
at
the
new
spotlights
when
the
newly
remastered
soundtrack
came
from
behind
the
gargoyles
at
the
corners
of
the
octagonal
room
i
leaned
my
body
slightly
in
the
direction
of
the
moving
and
an
instant
before
the
lights
snapped
out
i
ostentatiously
cast
my
eyes
up
into
the
scrim
ceiling
noting
that
others
had
taken
my
cue
so
they
were
watching
when
the
corpse
dropped
from
the
ceiling
jerking
against
the
noose
at
its
neck
the
crowd
filed
into
the
second
queue
area
where
they
boarded
the
doom
buggies
there
was
a
low
buzz
of
marveling
conversation
as
we
made
our
way
onto
the
moving
sidewalk
i
boarded
my
doom
buggy
and
an
instant
later
someone
slid
in
beside
me
it
was
the
elf
he
made
a
point
of
not
making
eye
contact
with
me
but
i
sensed
his
sidelong
glances
at
me
as
we
rode
through
past
the
floating
chandelier
and
into
the
corridor
where
the
portraits
eyes
watched
us
two
years
before
i
accelerated
this
sequence
and
added
some
random
swivel
to
the
doom
buggies
shaving
seconds
off
the
total
taking
the
hourly
throughput
cap
from
to
it
was
the
that
led
to
all
the
other
seconds
i
shaved
away
since
the
violent
pitching
of
the
buggy
brought
me
and
the
elf
into
inadvertent
contact
with
one
another
and
when
i
brushed
his
hand
as
i
reached
for
the
safety
bar
i
felt
that
it
was
cold
and
sweaty
he
was
nervous
was
nervous
what
did
have
to
be
nervous
about
i
was
the
one
who
been
murdered
maybe
he
was
nervous
because
he
was
supposed
to
finish
the
job
i
cast
my
own
sidelong
looks
at
him
trying
to
see
suspicious
bulges
in
his
tight
clothes
but
the
doom
buggy
pebbled
black
plastic
interior
was
too
dim
dan
was
in
the
buggy
behind
us
with
one
of
the
mansion
regular
castmembers
i
rang
his
cochlea
and
subvocalized
get
ready
to
jump
out
on
my
signal
anyone
leaving
their
buggy
would
interrupt
an
infrared
beam
and
stop
the
ride
system
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
dan
to
trust
me
without
a
lot
of
explaining
which
meant
that
i
could
keep
a
close
watch
on
crony
we
went
past
the
hallway
of
mirrors
and
into
the
hallway
of
doors
where
monstrous
hands
peeked
out
around
the
sills
straining
against
the
hinges
recorded
groans
mixed
in
with
pounding
i
thought
about
it
if
i
wanted
to
kill
someone
on
the
mansion
what
would
be
the
best
place
to
do
it
the
attic
staircase
the
next
sequence
seemed
like
a
good
bet
a
cold
clarity
washed
over
me
the
elf
would
kill
me
in
the
gloom
of
the
staircase
dump
me
out
over
the
edge
at
the
blind
turn
toward
the
graveyard
and
that
would
be
it
would
he
be
able
to
do
it
if
i
were
staring
straight
at
him
he
seemed
terribly
nervous
as
it
was
i
swiveled
in
my
seat
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
he
quirked
half
a
smile
at
me
and
nodded
a
greeting
i
kept
on
staring
at
him
my
hands
balled
into
fists
ready
for
anything
we
rode
down
the
staircase
facing
up
listening
to
the
clamour
of
voices
from
the
cemetery
and
the
squawk
of
the
raven
i
caught
sight
of
the
quaking
groundkeeper
animatronic
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
startled
i
let
out
a
subvocal
squeal
and
was
pitched
forward
as
the
ride
system
shuddered
to
a
stop
jules
came
dan
voice
in
my
cochlea
you
all
right
he
heard
my
involuntary
note
of
surprise
and
had
leapt
clear
of
the
buggy
stopping
the
ride
the
elf
was
looking
at
me
with
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
pity
it
all
right
it
all
right
false
alarm
i
paged
lil
and
subvocalized
to
her
telling
her
to
start
up
the
ride
asap
it
was
all
right
i
rode
the
rest
of
the
way
with
my
hands
on
the
safety
bar
my
eyes
fixed
ahead
of
me
steadfastly
ignoring
the
elf
i
checked
the
timer
been
running
the
demo
was
a
debacle
instead
of
shaving
off
three
seconds
i
added
thirty
i
wanted
to
cry
i
debarked
the
buggy
and
stalked
quickly
out
of
the
exit
queue
leaning
heavily
against
the
fence
staring
blindly
at
the
pet
cemetery
my
head
swam
i
was
out
of
control
jumping
at
shadows
i
was
spooked
and
i
had
no
reason
to
be
sure
i
been
murdered
but
what
had
it
cost
me
a
few
days
of
unconsciousness
while
they
decanted
my
backup
into
my
new
body
a
merciful
gap
in
memory
from
my
departure
at
the
backup
terminal
up
until
my
death
i
was
one
of
those
nuts
who
took
death
it
was
like
they
done
something
in
the
meantime
i
done
something
permanent
i
dug
lil
grave
a
little
deeper
endangered
the
and
worst
of
all
the
mansion
i
acted
like
an
idiot
i
tasted
my
dinner
a
hamburger
and
swallowed
hard
forcing
down
the
knob
of
nausea
i
sensed
someone
at
my
elbow
and
thinking
it
was
lil
come
to
ask
me
what
had
gone
on
i
turned
with
a
sheepish
grin
and
found
myself
facing
the
elf
he
stuck
his
hand
out
and
spoke
in
the
flat
of
someone
running
a
language
module
hi
there
we
have
been
introduced
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoy
your
work
i
tim
fung
i
pumped
his
hand
which
was
still
cold
and
particularly
clammy
in
the
close
heat
of
the
florida
night
julius
i
said
startled
at
how
much
like
a
bark
it
sounded
i
thought
need
to
escalate
the
it
kind
of
you
to
say
that
i
like
what
have
done
with
the
pirates
he
smiled
a
genuine
embarrassed
smile
as
though
he
just
been
given
high
praise
from
one
of
his
heroes
really
i
think
it
pretty
good
the
second
time
around
you
get
a
lot
of
chances
to
refine
things
really
clarify
the
vision
beijing
well
it
was
exciting
but
it
was
rushed
you
know
i
mean
we
were
really
struggling
every
day
there
was
another
pack
of
squatters
who
wanted
to
tear
the
park
down
debra
used
to
send
me
out
to
give
the
children
piggyback
rides
just
to
keep
our
whuffie
up
while
she
was
evicting
the
squatters
it
was
good
to
have
the
opportunity
to
refine
the
designs
revisit
them
without
the
floor
show
i
knew
about
this
of
course
beijing
had
been
a
real
struggle
for
the
who
built
it
lots
of
them
had
been
killed
many
times
over
debra
herself
had
been
killed
every
day
for
a
week
and
restored
to
a
series
of
prepared
clones
one
of
the
ride
systems
it
was
faster
than
revising
the
cad
simulations
debra
had
a
reputation
for
pursuing
expedience
i
starting
to
find
out
how
it
feels
to
work
under
pressure
i
said
and
nodded
significantly
at
the
mansion
i
was
gratified
to
see
him
look
embarrassed
then
horrified
we
would
touch
the
mansion
he
said
it
dan
and
lil
sauntered
up
as
i
was
preparing
a
riposte
they
both
looked
concerned
now
that
i
thought
of
it
they
both
seemed
incredibly
concerned
about
me
since
the
day
i
was
revived
dan
gait
was
odd
stilted
like
he
was
leaning
on
lil
for
support
they
looked
like
a
couple
an
irrational
sear
of
jealousy
jetted
through
me
i
was
an
emotional
wreck
still
i
took
lil
big
scarred
hand
in
mine
as
soon
as
she
was
in
reach
then
cuddled
her
to
me
protectively
she
had
changed
out
of
her
maid
uniform
into
civvies
smart
coveralls
whose
micropore
fabric
breathed
in
time
with
her
own
respiration
lil
dan
i
want
you
to
meet
tim
fung
he
was
just
telling
me
war
stories
from
the
pirates
project
in
beijing
lil
waved
and
dan
gravely
shook
his
hand
that
was
some
hard
work
dan
said
it
occurred
to
me
to
turn
on
some
whuffie
monitors
it
was
normally
an
instantaneous
reaction
to
meeting
someone
but
i
was
still
disoriented
i
pinged
the
elf
he
had
a
lot
of
whuffie
respect
garnered
from
people
who
shared
very
few
of
my
opinions
i
expected
that
what
i
did
expect
was
that
his
weighted
whuffie
score
the
one
that
lent
extra
credence
to
the
rankings
of
people
i
respected
was
also
high
higher
than
my
own
i
regretted
my
nonlinear
behavior
even
more
respect
from
the
elf
i
had
to
remember
to
call
him
tim
would
carry
a
lot
of
weight
in
every
camp
that
mattered
dan
score
was
incrementing
upwards
but
he
still
had
a
rotten
profile
he
had
accrued
a
good
deal
of
whuffie
and
i
curiously
backtraced
it
to
the
occasion
of
my
murder
when
debra
people
had
accorded
him
a
generous
dollop
of
props
for
the
levelheaded
way
he
had
scraped
up
my
corpse
and
moved
it
offstage
minimizing
the
disturbance
in
front
of
their
wondrous
pirates
i
was
fugueing
wandering
off
on
the
kind
of
mediated
reverie
that
got
me
killed
on
the
reef
at
playa
coral
and
i
came
out
of
it
with
a
start
realizing
that
the
other
three
were
politely
ignoring
my
blown
buffer
i
could
have
run
backwards
through
my
memory
to
get
the
gist
of
the
conversation
but
that
would
have
lengthened
the
pause
screw
it
so
how
things
going
over
at
the
hall
of
the
presidents
i
asked
tim
lil
shot
me
a
cautioning
look
she
ceded
the
hall
to
debra
that
being
the
only
way
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
childish
disattention
to
the
almighty
whuffie
now
she
had
to
keep
up
the
fiction
of
natured
cooperation
that
meant
not
debra
looking
for
excuses
to
pounce
on
her
work
tim
gave
us
the
same
he
greeted
me
with
on
his
smooth
pointed
features
it
looked
almost
irredeemably
cute
we
doing
good
stuff
i
think
debra
had
her
eye
on
the
hall
for
years
back
in
the
old
days
before
she
went
to
china
we
replacing
the
whole
thing
with
broadband
uplinks
of
gestalts
from
each
of
the
presidents
lives
newspaper
headlines
speeches
distilled
biographies
personal
papers
it
be
like
having
each
president
you
in
a
few
seconds
debra
said
we
going
to
the
presidents
on
your
mind
his
eyes
glittered
in
the
twilight
having
only
recently
experienced
my
own
cerebral
description
struck
a
chord
in
me
my
personality
seemed
to
be
rattling
around
a
little
in
my
mind
as
though
it
had
been
improperly
fitted
it
made
the
idea
of
having
the
gestalt
of
presidents
squashed
in
along
with
it
perversely
appealing
wow
i
said
that
sounds
wild
what
do
you
have
in
mind
for
physical
plant
the
hall
as
it
stood
had
a
quiet
patriotic
dignity
cribbed
from
a
hundred
official
buildings
of
the
dead
usa
messing
with
it
would
be
like
redesigning
the
that
not
really
my
area
tim
said
i
a
programmer
but
i
could
have
one
of
the
designers
squirt
some
plans
at
you
if
you
want
that
would
be
fine
lil
said
taking
my
elbow
i
think
we
should
be
heading
home
now
though
she
began
to
tug
me
away
dan
took
my
other
elbow
behind
her
the
liberty
belle
glowed
like
a
ghostly
wedding
cake
in
the
twilight
that
too
bad
tim
said
my
is
pulling
an
on
the
new
hall
i
sure
they
love
to
have
you
drop
by
the
idea
seized
hold
of
me
i
would
go
into
the
camp
of
the
enemy
sit
by
their
fire
learn
their
secrets
that
would
be
i
said
too
loudly
my
head
was
buzzing
slightly
lil
hands
fell
away
but
we
got
an
early
morning
tomorrow
lil
said
you
got
a
shift
at
eight
and
i
running
into
town
for
groceries
she
was
lying
but
she
was
telling
me
that
this
was
her
idea
of
a
smart
move
but
my
faith
was
unshakeable
eight
shift
no
problem
i
be
right
here
when
it
starts
just
grab
a
shower
at
the
contemporary
in
the
morning
and
catch
the
monorail
back
in
time
to
change
all
right
dan
tried
but
jules
we
were
going
to
grab
some
dinner
at
royal
table
remember
i
made
reservations
aw
we
can
eat
any
time
i
said
this
is
a
hell
of
an
opportunity
it
sure
is
dan
said
giving
up
mind
if
i
come
along
he
and
lil
traded
meaningful
looks
that
i
interpreted
to
mean
going
to
be
a
nut
one
of
us
really
should
stay
with
i
was
past
caring
i
was
going
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
tim
was
apparently
oblivious
to
all
of
this
then
it
settled
go
on
the
walk
to
the
hall
dan
kept
ringing
my
cochlea
and
i
kept
sending
him
straight
to
voicemail
all
the
while
i
kept
up
a
patter
of
talk
with
him
and
tim
i
was
determined
to
make
up
for
my
debacle
in
the
mansion
with
tim
win
him
over
debra
people
were
sitting
around
in
the
armchairs
onstage
the
animatronic
presidents
stacked
in
neat
piles
in
the
wings
debra
was
sprawled
in
lincoln
armchair
her
head
cocked
lazily
her
legs
extended
before
her
the
hall
normal
smells
of
ozone
and
cleanliness
were
overridden
by
sweat
and
the
stink
of
an
pulling
an
the
hall
took
fifteen
years
to
research
and
execute
and
a
couple
of
days
to
tear
down
she
was
still
wearing
the
face
she
been
born
with
albeit
one
that
had
been
regenerated
dozens
of
times
after
her
deaths
it
was
patrician
waxy
long
with
a
nose
that
was
made
for
staring
down
she
was
at
least
as
old
as
i
was
though
she
was
only
apparent
i
got
the
sense
that
she
picked
this
age
because
it
was
one
that
afforded
boundless
reserves
of
energy
she
did
deign
to
rise
as
i
approached
but
she
did
nod
languorously
at
me
the
other
had
been
split
into
little
clusters
hunched
over
terminals
they
all
had
the
look
of
fanatics
even
debra
who
managed
to
look
lazy
and
excited
simultaneously
you
have
me
i
wondered
staring
at
debra
after
all
been
killed
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
times
it
might
not
be
such
a
big
deal
for
her
hi
there
i
said
brightly
tim
offered
to
show
us
around
you
know
dan
right
debra
nodded
at
him
oh
sure
dan
and
i
are
pals
right
dan
poker
face
did
twitch
a
muscle
hello
debra
he
said
been
hanging
out
with
them
since
lil
had
briefed
him
on
the
peril
to
the
mansion
trying
to
gather
some
intelligence
for
us
to
use
they
knew
what
he
was
up
to
of
course
but
dan
was
a
fairly
charming
guy
and
he
worked
like
a
mule
so
they
tolerated
him
but
it
seemed
like
violated
a
boundary
by
accompanying
me
as
though
the
polite
fiction
that
he
was
more
a
part
of
debra
than
lil
was
shattered
by
my
presence
tim
said
can
i
show
them
the
demo
debra
debra
quirked
an
eyebrow
then
said
sure
why
not
you
like
this
guys
tim
hustled
us
backstage
where
lil
and
i
used
to
sweat
over
the
animatronics
and
cop
surreptitious
feels
everything
had
been
torn
loose
packed
up
stacked
they
had
wasted
a
moment
they
spent
a
week
tearing
down
a
show
that
had
run
for
more
than
a
century
the
scrim
that
the
projected
portions
of
the
show
normally
screened
on
was
ground
into
the
floor
spotted
with
grime
footprints
and
oil
tim
showed
me
to
a
backup
terminal
its
housing
was
off
and
any
number
of
wireless
keyboards
pointers
and
gloves
lay
strewn
about
it
it
had
the
look
of
a
prototype
this
is
it
our
uplink
so
far
we
got
a
demo
app
running
on
it
lincoln
old
speech
along
with
the
montage
just
switch
on
guest
access
and
i
it
to
you
it
wild
i
pulled
up
my
hud
and
switched
on
guest
access
tim
pointed
a
finger
at
the
terminal
and
my
brain
was
suffused
with
the
essence
of
lincoln
every
nuance
of
his
speech
the
painstakingly
researched
movement
tics
his
warts
and
beard
and
topcoat
it
almost
felt
like
i
lincoln
for
a
moment
and
then
it
passed
but
i
could
still
taste
the
lingering
coppery
flavor
of
and
chewing
tobacco
i
staggered
backwards
my
head
swam
with
rich
and
detailed
i
knew
on
the
spot
that
debra
hall
of
the
presidents
was
going
to
be
a
hit
dan
took
a
shot
off
the
uplink
too
tim
and
i
watched
him
as
his
expression
shifted
from
skepticism
to
delight
tim
looked
expectantly
at
me
that
really
fine
i
said
really
really
fine
moving
tim
blushed
thanks
i
did
the
gestalt
programming
it
my
specialty
debra
spoke
up
from
behind
him
she
sauntered
over
while
dan
was
getting
his
jolt
i
got
the
idea
in
beijing
when
i
was
dying
a
lot
there
something
wonderful
about
having
memories
implanted
like
really
working
your
brain
i
love
the
synthetic
clarity
of
it
all
tim
sniffed
not
synthetic
at
all
he
said
turning
to
me
it
nice
and
soft
right
i
sensed
deep
political
shoals
and
was
composing
my
reply
when
debra
said
tim
keeps
trying
to
make
it
all
more
impressionistic
less
he
wrong
of
course
we
do
want
to
simulate
the
experience
of
watching
the
show
we
want
to
tim
nodded
reluctantly
sure
transcend
it
but
the
way
we
do
that
is
by
making
the
experience
a
mile
in
the
presidents
shoes
what
the
point
of
a
bunch
of
dry
facts
on
someone
brain
chapter
one
night
in
the
hall
of
presidents
convinced
me
of
three
things
that
debra
people
had
had
me
killed
and
screw
their
alibis
that
they
would
kill
me
again
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
make
a
play
for
the
haunted
mansion
that
our
only
hope
for
saving
the
mansion
was
a
preemptive
strike
against
them
we
had
to
hit
them
hard
where
it
hurt
dan
and
i
had
been
treated
to
eight
hours
of
insectile
precision
in
the
hall
of
presidents
debra
people
working
with
effortless
cooperation
born
of
the
adversity
they
faced
in
beijing
debra
moved
from
team
to
team
making
suggestions
with
body
language
as
much
as
with
words
leaving
bursts
of
inspired
activity
in
her
wake
it
was
that
precision
that
convinced
me
of
point
one
any
this
tight
could
pull
off
anything
if
it
advanced
their
agenda
hell
call
them
what
they
were
an
army
point
two
came
to
me
when
i
sampled
the
lincoln
build
that
tim
finished
at
about
three
in
the
morning
after
intensive
consultation
with
debra
the
mark
of
a
great
ride
is
that
it
gets
better
the
second
time
around
as
the
detail
and
flourishes
start
to
impinge
on
your
consciousness
the
mansion
was
full
of
little
gimcracks
and
sly
nods
that
snuck
into
your
experience
on
each
successive
ride
tim
shuffled
his
feet
nervously
bursting
with
barely
restrained
pride
as
i
switched
on
public
access
he
dumped
the
app
to
my
public
directory
and
gingerly
i
executed
it
god
god
and
lincoln
and
and
oratory
and
ploughs
and
mules
and
greatcoats
it
rolled
over
me
it
punched
through
me
it
crashed
against
the
inside
of
my
skull
and
rebounded
the
first
pass
through
there
had
been
a
sense
of
order
of
narrative
but
this
this
was
gestalt
the
whole
thing
in
one
undifferentiated
ball
filling
me
and
spilling
over
it
was
panicky
for
a
moment
as
the
essence
of
lincolness
seemed
to
threaten
my
own
personality
and
just
as
it
was
about
to
overwhelm
me
it
receded
leaving
behind
a
rush
of
endorphin
and
adrenaline
that
made
me
want
to
jump
tim
i
gasped
tim
that
was
words
failed
me
i
wanted
to
hug
him
what
we
could
do
for
the
mansion
with
this
what
elegance
directly
imprinting
the
experience
without
recourse
to
the
stupid
blind
eyes
the
thick
deaf
ears
tim
beamed
and
basked
and
debra
nodded
solemnly
from
her
throne
you
liked
it
tim
said
i
nodded
and
staggered
back
to
the
theatre
seat
where
dan
slept
head
thrown
back
snores
softly
rattling
in
his
throat
incrementally
reason
trickled
back
into
my
mind
and
with
it
came
ire
how
dare
they
the
wonderful
compromises
of
technology
and
expense
that
had
given
us
the
disney
rides
rides
that
had
entertained
the
world
for
two
centuries
and
more
could
never
compete
head
to
head
with
what
they
were
working
on
my
hands
knotted
into
fists
in
my
lap
why
the
fuck
could
they
do
this
somewhere
else
why
did
they
have
to
destroy
everything
i
loved
to
realize
this
they
could
build
this
tech
anywhere
they
could
distribute
it
online
and
people
could
access
it
from
their
living
rooms
but
that
would
never
do
doing
it
here
was
better
for
the
old
whuffie
they
make
over
disney
world
and
hold
it
a
single
where
three
hundred
had
flourished
before
smoothly
operating
a
park
twice
the
size
of
manhattan
i
stood
and
stalked
out
of
the
theater
out
into
liberty
square
and
the
park
it
had
cooled
down
without
drying
out
and
there
was
a
damp
chill
that
crawled
up
my
back
and
made
my
breath
stick
in
my
throat
i
turned
to
contemplate
the
hall
of
presidents
staid
and
solid
as
it
had
been
since
my
boyhood
and
before
a
monument
to
the
imagineers
who
anticipated
the
bitchun
society
inspired
it
i
called
dan
still
snoring
back
in
the
theater
and
woke
him
he
grunted
unintelligibly
in
my
cochlea
they
did
it
they
killed
me
i
knew
they
had
and
i
was
glad
it
made
what
i
had
to
do
next
easier
oh
jesus
they
did
kill
you
they
offered
their
backups
remember
they
could
have
done
it
bullshit
i
shouted
into
the
empty
night
bullshit
they
did
it
and
they
fucked
with
their
backups
somehow
they
must
have
it
all
too
neat
and
tidy
how
else
could
they
have
gotten
so
far
with
the
hall
so
fast
they
knew
it
was
coming
they
planned
a
disruption
and
they
moved
in
tell
me
that
you
think
they
just
had
these
plans
lying
around
and
moved
on
them
when
they
could
dan
groaned
and
i
heard
his
joints
popping
he
must
have
been
stretching
the
park
breathed
around
me
the
sounds
of
maintenance
crews
scurrying
in
the
night
i
do
believe
that
clearly
you
do
it
not
the
first
time
we
disagreed
so
now
what
now
we
save
the
mansion
i
said
now
we
fight
back
oh
shit
dan
said
i
have
to
admit
there
was
a
part
of
me
that
concurred
my
opportunity
came
later
that
week
debra
were
showboating
announcing
a
special
preview
of
the
new
hall
to
the
other
that
worked
in
the
park
it
was
classic
chutzpah
letting
the
key
influencers
in
the
park
in
long
before
the
bugs
were
hammered
out
a
smooth
run
would
garner
the
kind
of
impressed
reaction
that
guaranteed
continued
support
while
they
finished
up
a
failed
demo
could
doom
them
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
the
park
who
had
a
sentimental
attachment
to
the
hall
of
presidents
and
whatever
debra
people
came
up
with
would
have
to
answer
their
longing
i
going
to
do
it
during
the
demo
i
told
dan
while
i
piloted
the
runabout
from
home
to
the
castmember
parking
i
snuck
a
look
at
him
to
gauge
his
reaction
he
had
his
poker
face
on
i
not
going
to
tell
lil
i
continued
it
better
that
she
know
plausible
deniability
and
me
he
said
do
i
need
plausible
deniability
no
i
said
no
you
do
you
an
outsider
you
can
make
the
case
that
you
were
working
on
your
own
gone
rogue
i
knew
it
was
fair
dan
was
here
to
build
up
his
whuffie
and
if
he
was
implicated
in
my
dirty
scheme
he
have
to
start
over
again
i
knew
it
was
fair
but
i
did
care
i
knew
that
we
were
fighting
for
our
own
survival
good
versus
evil
dan
you
do
want
to
be
a
you
want
to
stay
human
the
rides
are
human
we
each
mediate
them
through
our
own
experience
we
physically
inside
of
them
and
they
talk
to
us
through
our
senses
what
debra
people
are
building
it
shit
directly
implanting
thoughts
jesus
it
not
an
experience
brainwashing
you
got
ta
know
that
i
was
pleading
arguing
with
myself
as
much
as
with
him
i
snuck
another
look
at
him
as
i
sped
along
the
disney
lined
with
sweaty
florida
pines
and
immaculate
purple
signage
dan
was
looking
thoughtful
the
way
he
had
back
in
our
old
days
in
toronto
some
of
my
tension
dissipated
he
was
thinking
about
it
i
gotten
through
to
him
jules
this
is
one
of
your
better
ideas
my
chest
tightened
and
he
patted
my
shoulder
he
had
the
knack
of
putting
me
at
my
ease
even
when
he
was
telling
me
that
i
was
an
idiot
even
if
debra
was
behind
your
assassination
and
that
not
a
certainty
we
both
know
that
even
if
that
the
case
we
got
better
means
at
our
disposal
improving
the
mansion
competing
with
her
head
to
head
that
smart
give
it
a
little
while
and
we
can
come
back
at
her
take
over
the
hall
even
the
pirates
that
really
piss
her
off
hell
if
we
can
prove
she
was
behind
the
assassination
we
can
chase
her
off
right
now
sabotage
is
not
going
to
do
you
any
good
you
got
lots
of
other
options
but
none
of
them
are
fast
enough
and
none
of
them
are
emotionally
satisfying
this
way
has
some
goddamn
we
reached
castmember
parking
i
swung
the
runabout
into
a
slot
and
stalked
out
before
it
had
a
chance
to
extrude
its
recharger
cock
i
heard
dan
door
slam
behind
me
and
knew
that
he
was
following
behind
we
took
to
the
utilidors
grimly
i
walked
past
the
cameras
knowing
that
my
image
was
being
archived
my
presence
logged
i
picked
the
timing
of
my
raid
carefully
by
arriving
at
high
noon
i
was
sticking
to
my
traditional
pattern
for
watching
crowd
dynamics
i
made
a
point
of
visiting
twice
during
the
previous
week
at
this
time
and
of
dawdling
in
the
commissary
before
heading
topside
the
delay
between
my
arrival
in
the
runabout
and
my
showing
up
at
the
mansion
would
not
be
discrepant
dan
dogged
my
heels
as
i
swung
towards
the
commissary
and
then
hugged
the
wall
in
the
camera
blindspot
back
in
my
early
days
in
the
park
when
i
was
courting
lil
she
showed
me
the
the
old
pneumatic
system
decommissioned
in
the
the
kids
who
grew
up
in
the
park
had
been
notorious
explorers
of
the
tubes
which
still
whiffed
faintly
of
the
garbage
bags
they
once
whisked
at
mph
to
the
dump
on
the
property
outskirts
but
for
a
brave
limber
kid
the
tubes
were
a
subterranean
wonderland
to
explore
when
the
hypermediated
experiences
of
the
park
lost
their
luster
i
snarled
a
grin
and
popped
open
the
service
entrance
if
they
killed
me
and
forced
me
to
switch
to
a
new
body
i
probably
would
be
flexible
enough
to
fit
in
i
hissed
at
dan
ironic
huh
i
clambered
inside
without
waiting
for
a
reply
and
started
inching
my
way
under
the
hall
of
presidents
my
plan
had
covered
every
conceivable
detail
except
one
which
occur
to
me
until
i
was
forty
minutes
into
the
pneumatic
tube
arms
held
before
me
and
legs
angled
back
like
a
swimmer
how
was
i
going
to
reach
into
my
pockets
specifically
how
was
i
going
to
retrieve
my
herf
gun
from
my
back
when
i
could
even
bend
my
elbows
the
herf
gun
was
the
crux
of
the
plan
a
high
energy
radio
frequency
generator
with
a
directional
focused
beam
that
would
punch
up
through
the
floor
of
the
hall
of
presidents
and
fuse
every
goddamn
scrap
of
unshielded
electronics
on
the
premises
i
gotten
the
germ
of
the
idea
during
tim
first
demo
when
i
seen
all
of
his
prototypes
spread
out
backstage
cases
off
ready
to
be
tinkered
with
unshielded
dan
i
said
my
voice
oddly
muffled
by
the
tube
walls
yeah
he
said
he
been
silent
during
the
journey
the
sound
of
his
painful
progress
through
the
lightless
tube
my
only
indicator
of
his
presence
can
you
reach
my
back
pocket
oh
shit
he
said
goddamn
it
i
said
keep
the
fucking
editorial
to
yourself
can
you
reach
it
or
not
i
heard
him
grunt
as
he
pulled
himself
up
in
the
tube
then
felt
his
hand
groping
up
my
calf
soon
his
chest
was
crushing
my
calves
into
the
tube
floor
and
his
hand
was
pawing
around
my
ass
i
can
reach
it
he
said
i
could
tell
from
his
tone
that
he
was
too
happy
about
my
snapping
at
him
but
i
was
too
wrapped
up
to
consider
an
apology
despite
what
must
be
happening
to
my
whuffie
as
dan
did
his
slow
burn
he
fumbled
the
gun
a
narrow
cylinder
as
long
as
my
palm
out
of
my
pocket
now
what
he
said
can
you
pass
it
up
i
asked
dan
crawled
higher
overtop
of
me
but
stuck
fast
when
his
ribcage
met
my
glutes
i
ca
get
any
further
he
said
fine
i
said
you
have
to
fire
it
then
i
held
my
breath
would
he
do
it
it
was
one
thing
to
be
my
accomplice
another
to
be
the
author
of
the
destruction
aw
jules
he
said
a
simple
yes
or
no
dan
that
all
i
want
to
hear
from
you
i
was
boiling
with
anger
at
myself
at
dan
at
debra
at
the
whole
goddamn
thing
fine
he
said
good
dial
it
up
to
max
dispersion
and
point
it
straight
up
i
heard
him
release
the
catch
felt
a
staticky
crackle
in
the
air
and
then
it
was
done
the
gun
was
a
something
i
confiscated
from
a
mischievous
guest
a
decade
before
when
they
had
a
brief
vogue
hang
on
to
it
i
said
i
had
no
intention
of
leaving
such
a
damning
bit
of
evidence
behind
i
resumed
my
bellycrawl
forward
to
the
next
service
hatch
near
the
parking
lot
where
i
stashed
an
identical
change
of
clothes
for
both
of
us
we
made
it
back
just
as
the
demo
was
getting
underway
debra
were
ranged
around
the
mezzanine
inside
the
hall
of
presidents
a
collection
of
influential
castmembers
from
other
filling
the
area
to
capacity
dan
and
i
filed
in
just
as
tim
was
stringing
the
velvet
rope
up
behind
the
crowd
he
gave
me
a
genuine
smile
and
shook
my
hand
and
i
smiled
back
full
of
good
feelings
now
that
i
knew
that
he
was
going
down
in
flames
i
found
lil
and
slipped
my
hand
into
hers
as
we
filed
into
the
auditorium
which
had
the
smell
of
rug
shampoo
and
fresh
electronics
we
took
our
seats
and
i
bounced
my
leg
nervously
compulsively
while
debra
dressed
in
lincoln
coat
and
stovepipe
delivered
a
short
speech
there
was
some
kind
of
broadcast
rig
mounted
over
the
stage
now
something
to
allow
them
to
beam
us
all
their
app
in
one
humongous
burst
debra
finished
up
and
stepped
off
the
stage
to
a
polite
round
of
applause
and
they
started
the
demo
nothing
happened
i
tried
to
keep
the
grin
off
my
face
as
nothing
happened
no
tone
in
my
cochlea
indicating
a
new
file
in
my
public
directory
no
rush
of
sensation
nothing
i
turned
to
lil
to
make
some
snotty
remark
but
her
eyes
were
closed
her
mouth
lolling
open
her
breath
coming
in
short
huffs
down
the
row
every
castmember
was
in
the
same
attitude
of
deep
concentration
i
pulled
up
a
diagnostic
hud
nothing
no
diagnostics
no
hud
i
nothing
i
was
offline
offline
i
filed
out
of
the
hall
of
presidents
offline
i
took
hand
and
walked
to
the
liberty
belle
our
spot
for
private
conversations
offline
i
bummed
a
cigarette
from
her
lil
was
upset
even
through
my
bemused
offline
haze
i
could
tell
that
tears
pricked
her
eyes
why
did
you
tell
me
she
said
after
a
hard
moment
staring
into
the
moonlight
reflecting
off
the
river
tell
you
i
said
dumbly
they
really
good
they
better
than
good
they
better
than
us
oh
god
offline
i
could
find
stats
or
signals
to
help
me
discuss
the
matter
offline
i
tried
it
without
help
i
do
think
so
i
do
think
they
got
soul
i
do
think
they
got
history
i
do
think
they
got
any
kind
of
connection
to
the
past
the
world
grew
up
in
the
disneys
they
visit
this
place
for
continuity
as
much
as
for
entertainment
we
provide
that
i
offline
and
they
not
what
the
hell
happened
it
be
okay
lil
there
nothing
in
that
place
that
better
than
us
different
and
new
but
not
better
you
know
that
you
spent
more
time
in
the
mansion
than
anyone
you
know
how
much
refinement
how
much
work
there
is
in
there
how
can
something
they
whipped
up
in
a
couple
weeks
possibly
be
better
that
this
thing
we
been
maintaining
for
all
these
years
she
ground
the
back
of
her
sleeve
against
her
eyes
and
smiled
sorry
she
said
her
nose
was
red
her
eyes
puffy
her
freckles
livid
over
the
flush
of
her
cheeks
sorry
it
just
shocking
maybe
you
right
and
even
if
you
not
hey
that
the
whole
point
of
a
meritocracy
right
the
best
stuff
survives
everything
else
gets
supplanted
oh
shit
i
hate
how
i
look
when
i
cry
she
said
let
go
congratulate
them
as
i
took
her
hand
i
was
obscurely
pleased
with
myself
for
having
improved
her
mood
without
artificial
assistance
dan
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
as
lil
and
i
mounted
the
stage
at
the
hall
where
debra
and
a
knot
of
were
celebrating
by
passing
a
rock
around
debra
had
lost
the
tailcoat
and
hat
and
was
in
an
extreme
state
of
relaxation
arms
around
the
shoulders
of
two
of
her
cronies
pipe
between
her
teeth
she
grinned
around
the
pipe
as
lil
and
i
stumbled
through
some
insincere
compliments
nodded
and
toked
heavily
while
tim
applied
a
torch
to
the
bowl
thanks
she
said
laconically
it
was
a
team
effort
she
hugged
her
cronies
to
her
almost
knocking
their
heads
together
lil
said
what
your
timeline
then
debra
started
unreeling
a
long
spiel
about
critical
paths
milestones
requirements
meetings
and
i
tuned
her
out
were
crazy
for
that
process
stuff
i
stared
at
my
feet
at
the
floorboards
and
realized
that
they
were
floorboards
at
all
but
painted
over
a
copper
mesh
a
faraday
cage
that
why
the
herf
gun
had
done
anything
that
why
they
been
so
casual
about
working
with
the
shielding
off
their
computers
with
my
eye
i
followed
the
copper
shielding
around
the
entire
stage
and
up
the
walls
where
it
disappeared
into
the
ceiling
once
again
i
was
struck
by
the
evolvedness
of
how
their
trial
by
fire
in
china
had
armored
them
against
the
kind
of
that
the
fuzzy
bunnies
in
florida
myself
included
came
up
with
for
instance
i
did
think
there
was
a
single
castmember
in
the
park
outside
of
deb
clique
with
the
stones
to
stage
an
assassination
once
i
made
that
leap
i
realized
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
they
staged
another
one
and
another
and
another
whatever
they
could
get
away
with
debra
spiel
finally
wound
down
and
lil
and
i
headed
away
i
stopped
in
front
of
the
backup
terminal
in
the
gateway
between
liberty
square
and
fantasyland
when
was
the
last
time
you
backed
up
i
asked
her
if
they
could
go
after
me
they
might
go
after
any
of
us
yesterday
she
said
she
exuded
at
me
looking
more
like
an
overmediated
guest
than
a
tireless
castmember
let
run
another
backup
huh
we
should
really
back
up
at
night
and
at
lunchtime
with
things
the
way
they
are
we
ca
afford
to
lose
an
afternoon
work
much
less
a
week
lil
rolled
her
eyes
i
knew
better
than
to
argue
with
her
when
she
was
tired
but
this
was
too
crucial
to
set
aside
for
petulance
you
can
back
up
that
often
if
you
want
to
julius
but
do
tell
me
how
to
live
my
life
okay
come
on
lil
it
only
takes
a
minute
and
it
make
me
feel
a
lot
better
please
i
hated
the
whine
in
my
voice
no
julius
no
let
go
home
and
get
some
sleep
i
want
to
do
some
work
on
new
merch
for
the
mansion
some
collectible
stuff
maybe
for
christ
sake
is
it
really
so
much
to
ask
fine
wait
while
i
back
up
then
all
right
lil
groaned
and
glared
at
me
i
approached
the
terminal
and
cued
a
backup
nothing
happened
oh
yeah
right
i
was
offline
a
cool
sweat
broke
out
all
over
my
new
body
lil
grabbed
the
couch
as
soon
as
we
got
in
mumbling
something
about
wanting
to
work
on
some
revised
merch
ideas
she
had
i
glared
at
her
as
she
subvocalized
and
in
the
corner
shut
away
from
me
i
had
told
her
that
i
was
offline
yet
it
just
seemed
like
insignificant
personal
bitching
relative
to
the
crises
she
was
coping
with
besides
i
been
knocked
offline
before
though
not
in
fifty
years
and
often
as
not
the
system
righted
itself
after
a
good
night
sleep
i
could
visit
the
doctor
in
the
morning
if
things
were
still
screwy
so
i
crawled
into
bed
and
when
my
bladder
woke
me
in
the
night
i
had
to
go
into
the
kitchen
to
consult
our
old
starburst
clock
to
get
the
time
it
was
and
when
the
hell
had
we
expunged
the
house
of
all
timepieces
anyway
lil
was
sacked
out
on
the
couch
and
complained
feebly
when
i
tried
to
rouse
her
so
i
covered
her
with
a
blanket
and
went
back
to
bed
alone
i
woke
disoriented
and
crabby
without
my
customary
morning
jolt
of
endorphin
vivid
dreams
of
death
and
destruction
slipped
away
as
i
sat
up
i
preferred
to
let
my
subconscious
do
its
own
thing
so
i
long
ago
programmed
my
systems
to
keep
me
asleep
during
rem
cycles
except
in
emergencies
the
dream
left
a
foul
taste
in
my
mind
as
i
staggered
into
the
kitchen
where
lil
was
fixing
coffee
why
did
you
wake
me
up
last
night
i
one
big
ache
from
sleeping
on
the
couch
lil
said
as
i
stumbled
in
she
had
the
perky
jaunty
quality
of
someone
who
could
instruct
her
nervous
system
to
manufacture
endorphin
and
adrenaline
at
will
i
felt
like
punching
the
wall
you
would
get
up
i
said
and
slopped
coffee
in
the
general
direction
of
a
mug
then
scalded
my
tongue
with
it
and
why
are
you
up
so
late
i
was
hoping
you
would
cover
a
shift
for
me
the
merch
ideas
are
really
coming
together
and
i
wanted
to
hit
the
imagineering
shop
and
try
some
prototyping
ca
i
foraged
a
slice
of
bread
with
cheese
and
noticed
a
crumby
plate
in
the
sink
dan
had
already
eaten
and
gone
apparently
really
she
said
and
my
blood
started
to
boil
in
earnest
i
slammed
dan
plate
into
the
dishwasher
and
shoved
bread
into
my
maw
yes
really
it
your
shift
fucking
work
it
or
call
in
sick
lil
reeled
normally
i
was
the
soul
of
sweetness
in
the
morning
when
i
was
hormonally
enhanced
anyway
what
wrong
honey
she
said
going
into
helpful
castmember
mode
now
i
wanted
to
hit
something
besides
the
wall
just
leave
me
alone
all
right
go
fiddle
with
fucking
merch
i
got
real
work
to
do
in
case
you
have
noticed
debra
about
to
eat
you
and
your
little
band
of
plucky
adventurers
and
pick
her
teeth
with
the
bones
for
god
sake
lil
do
you
ever
get
fucking
angry
about
anything
do
you
have
any
goddamned
passion
lil
whitened
and
i
felt
a
sinking
feeling
in
my
gut
it
was
the
worst
thing
i
could
possibly
have
said
lil
and
i
met
three
years
before
at
a
barbecue
that
some
friends
of
her
parents
threw
a
kind
of
castmember
mixer
she
been
just
apparent
and
real
and
had
a
bubbly
flirty
vibe
that
made
me
dismiss
her
at
first
as
just
another
airhead
castmember
her
parents
tom
and
rita
on
the
other
hand
were
fascinating
people
members
of
the
original
that
had
seized
power
in
walt
disney
world
wresting
control
from
a
gang
of
wealthy
former
shareholders
who
been
operating
it
as
their
private
preserve
rita
was
apparent
or
so
but
she
radiated
a
maturity
and
a
fiery
devotion
to
the
park
that
threw
her
daughter
superficiality
into
sharp
relief
they
throbbed
with
whuffie
whuffie
beyond
measure
beyond
use
in
a
world
where
even
a
whuffie
loser
could
eat
sleep
travel
and
access
the
net
without
hassle
their
wealth
was
more
than
sufficient
to
repeatedly
access
the
piffling
few
scarce
things
left
on
earth
over
and
over
the
conversation
turned
to
the
first
day
when
she
and
her
pals
had
used
a
cutting
torch
on
the
turnstiles
and
poured
in
wearing
homemade
costumes
and
name
tags
they
infiltrated
the
shops
the
control
centers
the
rides
first
by
the
hundred
then
as
the
hot
july
day
ticked
by
by
the
thousand
the
shareholders
lackeys
who
worked
the
park
for
the
chance
to
be
a
part
of
the
magic
even
if
they
had
no
control
over
the
management
decisions
put
up
a
token
resistance
before
the
day
was
out
though
the
majority
had
thrown
in
their
lots
with
the
raiders
handing
over
security
codes
and
pitching
in
but
we
knew
the
shareholders
would
give
in
as
easy
as
that
mother
said
sipping
her
lemonade
we
kept
the
park
running
for
the
next
two
weeks
never
giving
the
shareholders
a
chance
to
fight
back
without
doing
it
in
front
of
the
guests
we
prearranged
with
a
couple
of
airline
to
add
extra
routes
to
orlando
and
the
guests
came
pouring
in
she
smiled
remembering
the
moment
and
her
features
in
repose
were
lil
almost
identically
it
was
only
when
she
was
talking
that
her
face
changed
muscles
tugging
it
into
an
expression
decades
older
than
the
face
that
bore
it
i
spent
most
of
the
time
running
the
merch
stand
at
madame
outside
the
mansion
gladhanding
the
guests
while
hissing
nasties
back
and
forth
with
the
shareholders
who
kept
trying
to
shove
me
out
i
slept
in
a
sleeping
bag
on
the
floor
of
the
utilidor
with
a
couple
dozen
others
in
three
hour
shifts
that
was
when
i
met
this
asshole
she
chucked
her
husband
on
the
shoulder
he
gotten
the
wrong
sleeping
bag
by
mistake
and
would
budge
when
i
came
down
to
crash
i
just
crawled
in
next
to
him
and
the
rest
as
they
say
is
history
lil
rolled
her
eyes
and
made
gagging
noises
jesus
rita
no
one
needs
to
hear
about
that
part
of
it
tom
patted
her
arm
lil
you
an
adult
if
you
ca
stomach
hearing
about
your
parents
courtship
you
can
either
sit
somewhere
else
or
grin
and
bear
it
but
you
do
get
to
dictate
the
topic
of
conversation
lil
gave
us
adults
a
very
youthful
glare
and
flounced
off
rita
shook
her
head
at
lil
departing
backside
there
not
much
fire
in
that
generation
she
said
not
a
lot
of
passion
it
our
fault
we
thought
that
disney
world
would
be
the
best
place
to
raise
a
child
in
the
bitchun
society
maybe
it
was
but
she
trailed
off
and
rubbed
her
palms
on
her
thighs
a
gesture
i
come
to
know
in
lil
by
and
by
i
guess
there
are
enough
challenges
for
them
these
days
they
too
cooperative
she
laughed
and
her
husband
took
her
hand
we
sound
like
our
parents
tom
said
we
were
growing
up
we
did
have
any
of
this
newfangled
stuff
we
took
our
chances
with
the
cave
bears
and
the
dinosaurs
tom
wore
himself
older
apparent
with
graying
sidewalls
and
crinkled
the
better
to
present
a
air
of
authority
to
the
guests
it
was
a
truism
among
the
that
women
castmembers
should
wear
themselves
young
men
old
we
just
a
couple
of
bitchun
fundamentalists
i
guess
lil
called
over
from
a
nearby
conversation
are
they
telling
you
what
a
pack
of
milksops
we
are
julius
when
you
get
tired
of
that
why
you
come
over
here
and
have
a
smoke
i
noticed
that
she
and
her
cohort
were
passing
a
crack
pipe
what
the
use
lil
mother
sighed
oh
i
do
know
that
it
as
bad
as
all
that
i
said
virtually
my
first
words
of
the
afternoon
i
was
painfully
conscious
that
i
was
only
there
by
courtesy
just
one
of
the
legion
of
hopefuls
who
flocked
to
orlando
every
year
aspiring
to
a
place
among
the
ruling
cliques
they
passionate
about
maintaining
the
park
that
for
sure
i
made
the
mistake
of
lifting
a
at
the
jungleboat
cruise
last
week
and
i
got
a
very
earnest
lecture
about
the
smooth
functioning
of
the
park
from
a
castmember
who
could
have
been
more
than
i
think
that
they
do
have
the
passion
for
creating
bitchunry
that
we
have
they
do
need
it
but
they
got
plenty
of
drive
to
maintain
it
lil
mother
gave
me
a
long
considering
look
that
i
did
know
what
to
make
of
i
could
tell
if
i
had
offended
her
or
what
i
mean
you
ca
be
a
revolutionary
after
the
revolution
can
you
did
we
all
struggle
so
that
kids
like
lil
would
have
to
funny
you
should
say
that
tom
said
he
had
the
same
considering
look
on
his
face
just
yesterday
we
were
talking
about
the
very
same
thing
we
were
talking
he
drew
a
breath
and
looked
askance
at
his
wife
who
nodded
about
deadheading
for
a
while
anyway
see
if
things
changed
much
in
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
i
felt
a
kind
of
shameful
disappointment
why
was
i
wasting
my
time
schmoozing
with
these
two
when
they
would
be
around
when
the
time
came
to
vote
me
in
i
banished
the
thought
as
quickly
as
it
came
i
was
talking
to
them
because
they
were
nice
people
not
every
conversation
had
to
be
strategically
important
really
deadheading
i
remember
that
i
thought
of
dan
then
about
his
views
on
the
cowardice
of
deadheading
on
the
bravery
of
ending
it
when
you
found
yourself
obsolete
he
comforted
me
once
when
my
last
living
relative
my
uncle
opted
to
go
to
sleep
for
three
thousand
years
my
uncle
had
been
born
and
had
never
quite
gotten
the
hang
of
it
still
he
was
my
link
to
my
family
to
my
first
adulthood
and
my
only
childhood
dan
had
taken
me
to
gananoque
and
we
spent
the
day
bounding
around
the
countryside
on
boots
sailing
high
over
the
lakes
of
the
thousand
islands
and
the
crazy
fiery
carpet
of
autumn
leaves
we
topped
off
the
day
at
a
dairy
commune
he
knew
where
they
still
made
cheese
from
cow
milk
and
there
been
a
thousand
smells
and
bottles
of
strong
cider
and
a
girl
whose
name
i
long
since
forgotten
but
whose
exuberant
laugh
i
remember
forever
and
it
was
so
important
then
my
uncle
going
to
sleep
for
three
milliennia
because
whatever
happened
there
were
the
leaves
and
the
lakes
and
the
crisp
sunset
the
color
of
blood
and
the
girl
laugh
have
you
talked
to
lil
about
it
rita
shook
her
head
it
just
a
thought
really
we
do
want
to
worry
her
she
not
good
with
hard
decisions
it
her
generation
they
changed
the
subject
not
long
thereafter
and
i
sensed
discomfort
knew
that
they
had
told
me
too
much
more
than
they
intended
i
drifted
off
and
found
lil
and
her
young
pals
and
we
toked
a
little
and
cuddled
a
little
within
a
month
i
was
working
at
the
haunted
mansion
tom
and
rita
were
invested
in
canopic
jars
in
kissimee
with
instructions
not
to
be
woken
until
their
newsbots
grabbed
sufficient
interesting
material
to
make
it
worth
their
while
and
lil
and
i
were
a
hot
item
lil
did
deal
well
with
her
parents
decision
to
deadhead
for
her
it
was
a
slap
in
the
face
a
reproach
to
her
and
her
generation
of
twittering
polyannic
castmembers
for
god
sake
lil
do
you
ever
get
fucking
angry
about
anything
do
you
have
any
goddamned
passion
the
words
were
out
of
my
mouth
before
i
knew
i
was
saying
them
and
lil
percent
of
my
age
young
enough
to
be
my
lil
my
lover
and
best
friend
and
sponsor
to
the
liberty
square
lil
turned
white
as
a
sheet
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
she
got
in
her
runabout
and
went
to
the
park
to
take
her
shift
i
went
back
to
bed
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
fan
as
it
made
its
lazy
turns
and
felt
like
shit
chapter
when
i
finally
returned
to
the
park
hours
had
passed
and
lil
had
not
come
back
to
the
house
if
she
tried
to
call
she
would
gotten
my
voicemail
i
had
no
way
of
answering
my
phone
as
it
turned
out
she
had
been
trying
to
reach
me
at
all
i
spent
the
time
alternately
moping
drinking
and
plotting
terrible
irrational
vengeance
on
debra
for
killing
me
destroying
my
relationship
taking
away
my
beloved
in
hindsight
anyway
hall
of
presidents
and
threatening
the
mansion
even
in
my
addled
state
i
knew
that
this
was
pretty
unproductive
and
i
kept
promising
that
i
would
cut
it
out
take
a
shower
and
some
and
get
to
work
at
the
mansion
i
was
working
up
the
energy
to
do
just
that
when
dan
came
in
jesus
he
said
shocked
i
guess
i
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
sprawled
on
the
sofa
in
my
underwear
all
gamy
and
baggy
and
bloodshot
hey
dan
how
it
goin
he
gave
me
one
of
his
patented
wry
looks
and
i
felt
the
same
weird
reversal
of
roles
that
we
undergone
at
the
u
of
t
when
he
had
become
the
native
and
i
had
become
the
interloper
he
was
the
together
one
with
the
wry
looks
and
i
was
the
pathetic
seeker
who
burned
all
his
reputation
capital
out
of
habit
i
checked
my
whuffie
and
a
moment
later
i
stopped
being
startled
by
its
low
score
and
was
instead
shocked
by
the
fact
that
i
could
check
it
at
all
i
was
back
online
now
what
do
you
know
about
that
i
said
staring
at
my
dismal
whuffie
what
he
said
i
called
his
cochlea
my
systems
are
back
online
i
subvocalized
he
started
you
were
offline
i
jumped
up
from
the
couch
and
did
a
little
happy
underwear
dance
i
but
i
not
i
felt
better
than
i
had
in
days
ready
to
beat
the
world
or
at
least
debra
let
me
take
a
shower
then
let
get
to
the
imagineering
labs
i
got
a
pretty
kickass
idea
the
idea
as
i
explained
it
in
the
runabout
was
a
preemptive
rehab
of
the
mansion
sabotaging
the
hall
had
been
a
nasty
stupid
idea
and
gotten
what
i
deserved
for
it
the
whole
point
of
the
bitchun
society
was
to
be
more
reputable
than
the
next
to
succeed
on
merit
not
trickery
despite
assassinations
and
the
like
so
a
rehab
it
would
be
back
in
the
early
days
of
the
disneyland
mansion
in
california
i
explained
walt
had
a
guy
in
a
suit
of
armor
just
past
the
first
doom
buggy
curve
he
leap
out
and
scare
the
hell
out
of
the
guests
as
they
went
by
it
did
last
long
of
course
the
poor
bastard
kept
getting
punched
out
by
startled
guests
and
besides
the
armor
was
too
comfortable
for
long
shifts
dan
chuckled
appreciatively
the
bitchun
society
had
all
but
done
away
with
any
sort
of
dull
repetitious
labor
and
what
remained
tending
bar
mopping
toilets
commanded
whuffie
aplenty
and
a
life
of
leisure
in
your
but
that
guy
in
the
suit
of
armor
he
could
you
get
a
slightly
different
show
every
time
it
like
the
castmembers
who
spiel
on
the
jungleboat
cruise
they
each
got
their
own
patter
their
own
jokes
and
even
though
the
animatronics
are
so
hot
it
makes
the
show
worth
seeing
you
going
to
fill
the
mansion
with
castmembers
in
armor
dan
asked
shaking
his
head
i
waved
away
his
objections
causing
the
runabout
to
swerve
terrifying
a
pack
of
guests
who
were
taking
a
ride
on
rented
bikes
around
the
property
no
i
said
flapping
a
hand
apologetically
at
the
faced
guests
not
at
all
but
what
if
all
of
the
animatronics
had
human
operators
telecontrollers
working
with
waldoes
we
let
them
interact
with
the
guests
talk
with
them
scare
them
we
get
rid
of
the
existing
animatronics
replace
with
robots
then
cast
the
parts
over
the
net
think
of
the
whuffie
you
could
put
say
a
thousand
operators
online
at
once
ten
shifts
per
day
each
of
them
caught
up
in
our
mansion
we
give
out
awards
for
outstanding
performances
the
shifts
be
based
on
popular
vote
in
effect
be
adding
another
ten
thousand
guests
to
the
mansion
throughput
every
day
only
these
guests
will
be
honorary
castmembers
that
pretty
good
dan
said
very
bitchun
debra
may
have
ai
and
but
you
have
human
interaction
courtesy
of
the
biggest
in
the
world
and
those
are
the
very
fans
debra
have
to
win
over
to
make
a
play
for
the
mansion
very
elegant
huh
the
first
order
of
business
was
to
call
lil
patch
things
up
and
pitch
the
idea
to
her
the
only
problem
was
my
cochlea
was
offline
again
my
mood
started
to
sour
and
i
had
dan
call
her
instead
we
met
her
up
at
imagineering
a
massive
complex
of
prefab
aluminum
buildings
painted
green
that
had
thronged
with
mad
inventors
since
the
bitchun
society
had
come
to
walt
disney
world
the
who
had
built
an
imagineering
department
in
florida
and
now
ran
the
thing
were
the
least
political
in
the
park
classic
types
who
would
work
for
anyone
so
long
as
the
ideas
were
cool
not
caring
about
whuffie
meant
that
they
accumulated
it
in
plenty
on
both
the
left
and
right
hands
lil
was
working
with
suneep
aka
the
merch
miracle
he
could
design
prototype
and
produce
a
souvenir
faster
than
anyone
shirts
sculptures
pens
toys
housewares
he
was
the
king
they
were
collaborating
on
their
huds
facing
each
other
across
a
in
the
middle
of
a
lab
as
big
as
a
basketball
court
cluttered
with
logomarked
tchotchkes
and
gabbling
away
while
their
eyes
danced
over
invisible
screens
dan
reflexively
joined
the
collaborative
space
as
he
entered
the
lab
leaving
me
the
only
one
out
on
the
joke
dan
was
clearly
delighted
by
what
he
saw
i
nudged
him
with
an
elbow
make
a
hardcopy
i
hissed
instead
of
pitying
me
he
just
airtyped
a
few
commands
and
pages
started
to
roll
out
of
a
printer
in
the
lab
corner
anyone
else
would
have
made
a
big
deal
out
of
it
but
he
just
brought
me
into
the
discussion
if
i
needed
proof
that
lil
and
i
were
meant
for
each
other
the
designs
she
and
suneep
had
come
up
with
were
more
than
enough
she
been
thinking
just
the
way
i
had
souvenirs
that
stressed
the
human
scale
of
the
mansion
there
were
miniature
animatronics
of
the
hitchhiking
ghosts
in
a
box
their
skeletal
robotics
visible
through
their
layers
of
plastic
clothing
action
figures
that
communicated
by
ir
so
that
placing
one
in
proximity
with
another
would
unlock
its
behaviors
the
raven
cawed
mme
leota
head
incanted
the
singing
busts
sang
she
worked
up
some
formal
attire
based
on
the
castmember
costume
cut
in
this
year
stylish
lines
it
was
good
merch
is
what
i
trying
to
say
in
my
mind
eye
i
was
seeing
the
relaunch
of
the
mansion
in
six
months
filled
with
robotic
avatars
of
the
world
mme
leota
gift
cart
piled
high
with
brilliant
swag
strolling
human
players
with
the
guests
in
the
queue
area
lil
looked
up
from
her
mediated
state
and
glared
at
me
as
i
pored
over
the
hardcopy
nodding
enthusiastically
passionate
enough
for
you
she
snapped
i
felt
a
flush
creeping
into
face
my
ears
it
was
somewhere
between
anger
and
shame
and
i
reminded
myself
that
i
was
more
than
a
century
older
than
her
and
it
was
my
responsibility
to
be
mature
also
started
the
fight
this
is
fucking
fantastic
lil
i
said
her
look
did
soften
really
choice
stuff
i
had
a
great
idea
i
ran
it
down
for
her
the
avatars
the
robots
the
rehab
she
stopped
glaring
started
taking
notes
smiling
showing
me
her
dimples
her
slanted
eyes
crinkling
at
the
corners
this
is
easy
she
said
finally
suneep
who
been
politely
pretending
not
to
listen
in
nodded
involuntarily
dan
too
i
know
that
i
said
the
flush
burned
hotter
but
that
the
point
what
debra
does
is
easy
either
it
risky
dangerous
it
made
her
and
her
better
it
made
them
sharper
than
us
for
they
can
make
decisions
like
this
fast
and
execute
them
just
as
quickly
we
need
to
be
able
to
do
that
too
was
i
really
advocating
being
more
like
debra
the
words
just
popped
out
but
i
saw
that
i
been
right
we
have
to
beat
debra
at
her
own
game
her
i
understand
what
you
saying
lil
said
i
could
tell
she
was
upset
she
reverted
to
castmemberspeak
it
a
very
good
idea
i
think
that
we
stand
a
good
chance
of
making
it
happen
if
we
approach
the
group
and
put
it
to
them
after
doing
the
research
building
the
plans
laying
out
the
critical
path
and
privately
soliciting
feedback
from
some
of
them
i
felt
like
i
was
swimming
in
molasses
at
the
rate
that
the
liberty
square
moved
we
be
holding
formal
requirements
reviews
while
debra
people
tore
down
the
mansion
around
us
so
i
tried
a
different
tactic
suneep
you
been
involved
in
some
rehabs
right
suneep
nodded
slowly
with
a
cautious
expression
a
nonpolitical
animal
being
drawn
into
a
political
discussion
okay
so
tell
me
if
we
came
to
you
with
this
plan
and
asked
you
to
pull
together
a
production
schedule
one
that
did
have
any
review
just
take
the
idea
and
run
with
it
and
then
pull
it
off
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
execute
it
lil
smiled
primly
she
dealt
with
imagineering
before
about
five
years
he
said
almost
instantly
five
years
i
squawked
why
five
years
debra
people
overhauled
the
hall
in
a
month
oh
wait
he
said
no
review
at
all
no
review
just
come
up
with
the
best
way
you
can
to
do
this
and
do
it
and
we
can
provide
you
with
unlimited
skilled
labor
three
shifts
around
the
clock
he
rolled
his
eyes
back
and
ticked
off
days
on
his
fingers
while
muttering
under
his
breath
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
shock
of
curly
dark
hair
that
he
smoothed
unconsciously
with
surprisingly
stubby
fingers
while
he
thought
about
eight
weeks
he
said
barring
accidents
assuming
parts
unlimited
labor
capable
management
material
availability
he
trailed
off
again
and
his
short
fingers
waggled
as
he
pulled
up
a
hud
and
started
making
a
list
wait
lil
said
alarmed
how
do
you
get
from
five
years
to
eight
weeks
now
it
was
my
turn
to
smirk
i
seen
how
imagineering
worked
when
they
were
on
their
own
building
prototypes
and
conceptual
mockups
i
knew
that
the
real
bottleneck
was
the
constant
review
and
revisions
the
groupmind
consensus
of
the
that
commissioned
their
work
suneep
looked
sheepish
well
if
all
i
have
to
do
is
satisfy
myself
that
my
plans
are
good
and
my
buildings
wo
fall
down
i
can
make
it
happen
very
fast
of
course
my
plans
are
perfect
sometimes
i
be
halfway
through
a
project
when
someone
suggests
a
new
flourish
or
approach
that
makes
the
whole
thing
immeasurably
better
then
it
back
to
the
drawing
board
so
i
stay
at
the
drawing
board
for
a
long
time
at
the
start
get
feedback
from
other
imagineers
from
the
from
focus
groups
and
the
net
then
we
do
reviews
at
every
stage
of
construction
check
to
see
if
anyone
has
had
a
great
idea
we
thought
of
and
incorporate
it
sometimes
rolling
back
the
work
it
slow
but
it
works
lil
was
flustered
but
if
you
can
do
a
complete
revision
in
eight
weeks
why
not
just
finish
it
then
plan
another
revision
do
one
in
eight
weeks
and
so
on
why
take
five
years
before
anyone
can
ride
the
thing
because
that
how
it
done
i
said
to
lil
but
that
not
how
it
to
be
done
that
how
we
save
the
mansion
i
felt
the
surety
inside
of
me
the
certain
knowledge
that
i
was
right
was
a
great
thing
a
bitchun
thing
but
the
organization
needed
to
turn
on
a
dime
that
would
be
even
bitchun
lil
i
said
looking
into
her
eyes
trying
to
burn
my
pov
into
her
we
have
to
do
this
it
our
only
chance
we
recruit
hundreds
to
come
to
florida
and
work
on
the
rehab
we
give
every
mansion
nut
on
the
planet
a
shot
at
joining
up
then
we
recruit
them
again
to
work
at
it
to
run
the
telepresence
rigs
we
get
from
the
biggest
in
the
world
and
we
build
something
better
and
faster
than
any
ever
has
without
abandoning
the
original
imagineers
vision
it
will
be
unspeakably
bitchun
lil
dropped
her
eyes
and
it
was
her
turn
to
flush
she
paced
the
floor
hands
swinging
at
her
sides
i
could
tell
that
she
was
still
angry
with
me
but
excited
and
scared
and
yes
passionate
it
not
up
to
me
you
know
she
said
at
length
still
pacing
dan
and
i
exchanged
wicked
grins
she
was
in
i
know
i
said
but
it
was
almost
she
was
a
real
in
the
liberty
square
someone
who
knew
the
systems
back
and
forth
someone
who
made
good
reasonable
decisions
and
kept
her
head
in
a
crisis
not
a
hothead
not
prone
to
taking
radical
switchbacks
this
plan
would
burn
up
that
reputation
and
the
whuffie
that
accompanied
it
in
short
order
but
by
the
time
that
happened
she
have
plenty
of
whuffie
with
the
new
i
mean
i
ca
guarantee
anything
i
like
to
study
the
plans
that
imagineering
comes
through
with
do
some
i
started
to
object
to
remind
her
that
speed
was
of
the
essence
but
she
beat
me
to
it
but
i
wo
we
have
to
move
fast
i
in
she
did
come
into
my
arms
did
kiss
me
and
tell
me
everything
was
forgiven
but
she
bought
in
and
that
was
enough
my
systems
came
back
online
sometime
that
day
and
i
hardly
noticed
i
was
so
preoccupied
with
the
new
mansion
holy
shit
was
it
ever
audacious
since
the
first
mansion
opened
in
california
in
no
one
had
ever
had
the
guts
to
seriously
fuxor
with
it
oh
sure
the
paris
version
phantom
manor
had
a
slightly
different
storyline
but
it
was
just
a
minor
bit
of
tweakage
to
satisfy
the
european
market
at
the
time
no
one
wanted
to
screw
up
the
legend
what
the
hell
made
the
mansion
so
cool
anyway
i
been
to
disney
world
any
number
of
times
as
a
guest
before
i
settled
in
and
truth
be
told
it
had
never
been
my
absolute
favorite
but
when
i
returned
to
disney
world
live
and
in
person
freshly
bored
stupid
by
the
liveheaded
flight
from
toronto
i
found
myself
to
it
i
a
terrible
terrible
person
to
visit
with
since
i
was
a
punk
kid
snaking
my
way
through
crowded
subway
platforms
eeling
into
the
only
seat
on
a
packed
car
i
been
obsessed
with
beating
the
crowd
in
the
early
days
of
the
bitchun
society
i
known
a
blackjack
player
a
compulsive
counter
of
cards
an
idiot
savant
of
odds
he
was
a
pudgy
unassuming
engineer
the
moderately
successful
founder
of
a
moderately
successful
startup
that
had
done
something
arcane
with
software
agents
while
he
was
only
moderately
successful
he
was
fabulously
wealthy
he
never
raised
a
cent
of
financing
for
his
company
and
had
owned
it
outright
when
he
finally
sold
it
for
a
bathtub
full
of
money
his
secret
was
the
green
felt
tables
of
vegas
where
pilgrim
off
to
every
time
his
bank
balance
dropped
there
to
count
the
and
calculate
the
odds
and
beat
the
house
long
after
his
software
company
was
sold
long
after
he
made
his
nut
he
was
dressing
up
in
silly
disguises
and
hitting
the
tables
grinding
out
hand
after
hand
of
for
the
sheer
satisfaction
of
beating
the
house
for
him
it
was
pure
a
jolt
of
every
time
the
dealer
busted
and
every
time
he
doubled
down
on
a
deckfull
of
face
cards
though
i
never
bought
so
much
as
a
lottery
ticket
i
immediately
got
his
compulsion
for
me
it
was
beating
the
crowd
finding
the
path
of
least
resistance
filling
the
gaps
guessing
the
short
queue
dodging
the
traffic
changing
lanes
with
a
whisper
to
spare
moving
with
precision
and
grace
and
above
all
on
that
fateful
return
i
checked
into
the
fort
wilderness
campground
pitched
my
tent
and
fairly
ran
to
the
ferry
docks
to
catch
a
barge
over
to
the
main
gate
crowds
were
light
until
i
got
right
up
to
main
gate
and
the
ticketing
queues
suppressing
an
initial
instinct
to
dash
for
the
farthest
one
beating
my
ferrymates
to
what
said
would
have
the
shortest
wait
i
stepped
back
and
did
a
quick
visual
survey
of
the
twenty
kiosks
and
evaluated
the
huddle
in
front
of
each
have
been
primarily
interested
in
their
ages
but
that
is
less
and
less
a
measure
of
anything
other
than
outlook
so
instead
i
carefully
examined
their
queuing
styles
their
dress
and
more
than
anything
their
burdens
you
can
tell
more
about
someone
ability
to
efficiently
negotiate
the
complexities
of
a
queue
through
what
they
carry
than
through
any
other
means
if
only
more
people
realized
it
the
classic
of
course
is
the
unladen
citizen
a
person
naked
of
even
a
modest
shoulderbag
or
marsupial
pocket
to
the
layperson
such
a
specimen
might
be
thought
of
as
a
sure
bet
for
a
fast
transaction
but
i
done
an
informal
study
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
brave
iconoclasts
are
often
the
flightiest
of
the
lot
left
smiling
with
bovine
mystification
patting
down
their
pockets
in
a
fruitless
search
for
a
writing
implement
a
piece
of
id
a
keycard
a
rabbit
foot
a
rosary
a
tuna
sandwich
no
for
my
money
i
take
what
i
call
the
road
worrier
anytime
such
a
person
is
apt
to
be
carefully
slung
with
four
or
five
carriers
of
one
description
or
another
from
bulging
cargo
pockets
to
clever
grade
pouches
with
biometrically
keyed
closures
the
thing
to
watch
for
is
the
ergonomic
consideration
given
to
these
conveyances
do
they
balance
are
they
slung
for
minimum
interference
and
maximum
ease
of
access
someone
who
given
that
much
consideration
to
their
gear
is
likely
spending
their
time
in
line
determining
which
bits
and
pieces
they
need
when
they
reach
its
headwaters
and
is
holding
them
at
ready
for
processing
this
is
a
tricky
call
since
there
are
lookalike
pretenders
who
pack
because
they
lack
the
organizational
smarts
to
figure
out
what
they
should
pack
they
just
as
apt
to
be
burdened
with
bags
and
pockets
and
pouches
but
the
telltale
is
the
efficiency
of
that
slinging
these
pack
mules
will
sag
beneath
their
loads
juggling
this
and
that
while
pushing
overloose
straps
up
on
their
shoulders
i
spied
a
queue
that
was
made
up
of
a
group
of
road
worriers
a
queue
that
was
slightly
longer
than
the
others
but
i
joined
it
and
ticced
nervously
as
i
watched
my
progress
relative
to
the
other
spots
i
could
chosen
i
was
borne
out
a
positive
omen
for
a
world
and
i
was
sauntering
down
main
street
usa
long
before
my
ferrymates
returning
to
walt
disney
world
was
a
homecoming
for
me
my
parents
had
brought
me
the
first
time
when
i
was
all
of
ten
just
as
the
first
inklings
of
the
bitchun
society
were
trickling
into
consciousness
the
death
of
scarcity
the
death
of
death
the
struggle
to
rejig
an
economy
that
had
grown
up
focused
on
nothing
but
scarcity
and
death
my
memories
of
the
trip
are
dim
but
warm
the
balmy
florida
climate
and
a
sea
of
smiling
faces
punctuated
by
magical
darkened
moments
riding
in
omnimover
cars
past
diorama
after
diorama
i
went
again
when
i
graduated
high
school
and
was
amazed
by
the
richness
of
detail
the
grandiosity
and
grandeur
of
it
all
i
spent
a
week
there
stunned
bovine
grinning
and
wandering
from
corner
to
corner
someday
i
knew
i
come
to
live
there
the
park
became
a
touchstone
for
me
a
constant
in
a
world
where
everything
changed
again
and
again
i
came
back
to
the
park
grounding
myself
communing
with
all
the
people
i
been
that
day
i
bopped
from
land
to
land
ride
to
ride
seeking
out
the
short
lines
the
eye
of
the
hurricane
that
crowded
the
park
to
capacity
take
high
ground
standing
on
a
bench
or
hopping
up
on
a
fence
and
do
a
visual
reccy
of
all
the
queues
in
sight
try
to
spot
prevailing
currents
in
the
flow
of
the
crowd
generally
having
a
high
old
obsessive
time
truth
be
told
i
probably
spent
as
much
time
looking
for
as
i
would
spent
lining
up
like
a
good
little
sheep
but
i
had
more
fun
and
got
more
exercise
the
haunted
mansion
was
experiencing
a
major
empty
spell
the
snow
crash
spectacular
parade
had
just
swept
through
liberty
square
en
route
to
fantasyland
dragging
hordes
of
guests
along
with
it
dancing
to
the
japrap
sounds
of
the
comical
and
aping
the
movements
of
the
brave
hiro
protagonist
when
they
blew
out
liberty
square
was
a
ghost
town
and
i
grabbed
the
opportunity
to
ride
the
mansion
five
times
in
a
row
walking
on
every
time
the
way
i
tell
it
to
lil
i
noticed
her
and
then
i
noticed
the
mansion
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
the
other
way
around
the
first
couple
rides
through
i
was
just
glad
of
the
aggressive
air
conditioning
and
the
delicious
sensation
of
sweat
drying
on
my
skin
but
on
the
third
pass
i
started
to
notice
just
how
goddamn
cool
the
thing
was
there
was
a
single
bit
of
tech
more
advanced
than
a
projector
in
the
whole
place
but
it
was
all
so
cunningly
contrived
that
the
illusion
of
a
haunted
house
was
perfect
the
ghosts
that
whirled
through
the
ballroom
were
and
ethereal
and
phantasmic
the
ghosts
that
sang
in
comical
tableaux
through
the
graveyard
were
equally
convincing
genuinely
witty
and
simultaneously
creepy
my
fourth
pass
through
i
noticed
the
the
hostile
eyes
worked
into
the
wallpaper
pattern
the
motif
repeated
in
the
molding
the
chandeliers
the
photo
gallery
i
began
to
pick
out
the
words
to
grim
grinning
ghosts
the
song
that
is
repeated
throughout
the
ride
whether
in
sinister
repeating
the
main
theme
troppo
troppo
or
the
spritely
singing
of
the
four
musical
busts
in
the
graveyard
it
a
catchy
tune
one
that
i
hummed
on
my
fifth
pass
through
this
time
noticing
that
the
overaggressive
ac
was
actually
mysterious
chills
that
blew
through
the
rooms
as
wandering
spirits
made
their
presence
felt
by
the
time
i
debarked
for
the
fifth
time
i
was
whistling
the
tune
with
jazzy
improvisations
in
a
tempo
that
when
lil
and
i
ran
into
each
other
she
was
picking
up
a
discarded
wrapper
i
seen
a
dozen
castmembers
picking
up
trash
that
day
seen
it
so
frequently
that
i
started
doing
it
myself
she
grinned
slyly
at
me
as
i
debarked
into
the
disinfectant
perfume
of
the
park
hands
in
pockets
thoroughly
pleased
with
myself
for
having
so
completely
a
really
fine
hunk
of
art
i
smiled
back
at
her
because
it
was
only
natural
that
one
of
the
who
were
privileged
to
tend
this
bit
of
heavenly
entertainment
should
notice
how
thoroughly
i
was
enjoying
her
work
that
really
really
bitchun
i
said
to
her
admiring
the
titanic
mountains
of
whuffie
my
hud
attributed
to
her
she
was
in
character
and
not
supposed
to
be
cheerful
but
castmembers
of
her
generation
ca
help
but
be
friendly
she
compromised
between
ghastly
demeanor
and
her
natural
sweet
spirit
and
leered
a
grin
at
me
thumped
through
a
zombie
curtsey
and
moaned
thank
you
we
try
to
keep
it
i
groaned
appreciatively
and
started
to
notice
just
how
very
cute
she
was
this
little
button
of
a
girl
with
her
rotting
maid
uniform
and
her
duster
she
was
just
so
clean
and
scrubbed
and
happy
about
everything
she
radiated
it
and
made
me
want
to
pinch
her
cheeks
either
set
the
moment
was
on
me
and
so
i
said
when
do
they
let
you
ghouls
off
i
love
to
take
you
out
for
a
zombie
or
a
bloody
mary
which
led
to
more
horrifying
banter
and
to
my
taking
her
out
for
a
couple
at
the
adventurer
club
learning
her
age
in
the
process
and
losing
my
nerve
telling
myself
that
there
was
nothing
we
could
possibly
have
to
say
to
each
other
across
a
gap
while
i
tell
lil
that
i
noticed
her
first
and
the
mansion
second
the
reverse
is
indeed
true
but
it
also
true
and
i
never
told
her
this
that
the
thing
i
love
best
about
the
mansion
is
it
where
i
met
her
dan
and
i
spent
the
day
riding
the
mansion
drafting
scripts
for
the
telepresence
players
who
we
hoped
to
bring
we
were
in
a
totally
creative
zone
the
dialog
running
as
fast
as
he
could
transcribe
it
jamming
on
ideas
with
dan
was
just
about
as
terrific
as
a
could
be
i
was
all
for
leaking
the
plan
to
the
net
right
away
getting
action
with
our
core
audience
but
lil
turned
it
down
she
was
going
to
spend
the
next
couple
days
quietly
politicking
among
the
rest
of
the
getting
some
support
for
the
idea
and
she
did
want
the
appearance
of
impropriety
that
would
come
from
having
outsiders
being
brought
in
before
the
talking
to
the
bringing
them
around
it
was
a
skill
i
never
really
mastered
dan
was
good
at
it
lil
was
good
at
it
but
me
i
think
that
i
was
too
to
ever
develop
good
skills
as
a
peacemaker
in
my
younger
days
i
assumed
that
it
was
because
i
was
smarter
than
everyone
else
with
no
patience
for
explaining
things
in
short
words
for
who
just
did
get
it
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
i
a
bright
enough
guy
but
i
hardly
a
genius
especially
when
it
comes
to
people
probably
comes
from
beating
the
crowd
never
seeing
individuals
just
the
mass
the
enemy
of
expedience
i
never
would
have
made
it
into
the
liberty
square
on
my
own
lil
made
it
happen
for
me
long
before
we
started
sleeping
together
assumed
that
her
folks
would
be
my
best
allies
in
the
process
of
joining
up
but
they
were
too
jaded
too
ready
to
take
the
long
sleep
to
pay
much
attention
to
a
newcomer
like
me
lil
took
me
under
her
wing
inviting
me
to
parties
talking
me
up
to
her
cronies
quietly
passing
around
copies
of
my
and
she
did
the
same
in
reverse
sincerely
extolling
the
virtues
of
the
others
i
met
so
that
i
knew
what
there
was
to
respect
about
them
and
could
help
but
treat
them
as
individuals
in
the
years
since
i
lost
that
respect
mostly
i
palled
around
with
lil
and
once
he
arrived
dan
and
with
around
the
world
the
that
i
worked
with
all
day
treated
me
with
basic
courtesy
but
not
much
friendliness
i
guess
i
treated
them
the
same
when
i
pictured
them
in
my
mind
they
were
a
faceless
mass
too
caught
up
in
the
starchy
world
of
to
ever
do
much
of
anything
dan
and
i
threw
ourselves
into
it
headlong
trolling
the
net
for
address
lists
of
from
the
four
corners
of
the
globe
spreadsheeting
them
against
their
timezones
temperaments
and
of
course
their
whuffie
that
weird
i
said
looking
up
from
the
terminal
i
was
using
my
systems
were
back
offline
they
been
sputtering
up
and
down
for
a
couple
days
now
and
i
kept
meaning
to
go
to
the
doctor
but
i
never
gotten
to
it
periodically
i
get
a
jolt
of
urgency
when
i
remembered
that
this
meant
my
backup
was
but
the
mansion
always
took
precedence
huh
he
said
i
tapped
the
display
see
these
it
was
a
displaying
a
collection
of
animated
meshes
of
various
elements
of
the
mansion
part
of
a
giant
collaborative
project
that
had
been
ongoing
for
decades
to
build
an
accurate
walkthrough
of
every
inch
of
the
park
i
used
those
meshes
to
build
my
own
testing
those
are
terrific
dan
said
that
guy
must
be
a
total
the
meshes
author
had
painstakingly
modeled
chained
and
animated
every
ghost
in
the
ballroom
scene
complete
with
the
kinematics
necessary
for
full
motion
where
a
normal
might
used
a
standard
human
kinematics
library
for
the
figures
this
one
had
actually
written
his
own
from
the
ground
up
so
that
the
ghosts
moved
with
a
spectral
fluidity
that
was
utterly
unhuman
who
the
author
dan
asked
do
we
have
him
on
our
list
yet
i
scrolled
down
to
display
the
credits
i
be
damned
dan
breathed
the
author
was
tim
debra
elfin
crony
he
submitted
the
designs
a
week
before
my
assassination
what
do
you
think
it
means
i
asked
dan
though
i
had
a
couple
ideas
on
the
subject
myself
tim
a
mansion
nut
dan
said
i
knew
that
you
knew
he
looked
a
little
defensive
sure
i
told
you
back
when
you
had
me
hanging
out
with
debra
gang
had
i
asked
him
to
hang
out
with
debra
as
i
remembered
it
it
had
been
his
suggestion
too
much
to
think
about
but
what
does
it
mean
dan
is
he
an
ally
should
we
try
to
recruit
him
or
is
he
the
one
that
convinced
debra
she
needs
to
take
over
the
mansion
dan
shook
his
head
i
not
even
sure
that
she
wants
to
take
over
the
mansion
i
know
debra
all
she
wants
to
do
is
turn
ideas
into
things
as
fast
and
as
copiously
as
possible
she
picks
her
projects
carefully
she
acquisitive
sure
but
she
cautious
she
had
a
great
idea
for
presidents
and
so
she
took
over
i
never
heard
her
talk
about
the
mansion
of
course
you
did
she
cagey
did
you
hear
her
talk
about
the
hall
of
presidents
dan
fumbled
not
really
i
mean
not
in
so
many
words
but
but
nothing
i
said
she
after
the
mansion
she
after
the
magic
kingdom
she
after
the
park
she
taking
over
goddamn
it
and
the
only
one
who
seems
to
have
noticed
i
came
clean
to
lil
about
my
systems
that
night
as
we
were
fighting
fighting
had
become
our
regular
evening
pastime
and
dan
had
taken
to
sleeping
at
one
of
the
hotels
rather
than
endure
it
i
started
it
of
course
we
going
to
get
killed
if
we
do
get
off
our
asses
and
start
the
rehab
i
said
slamming
myself
down
on
the
sofa
and
kicking
at
the
scratched
coffee
table
i
heard
the
hysteria
and
unreason
in
my
voice
and
it
just
made
me
madder
i
was
frustrated
by
not
being
able
to
check
in
on
suneep
and
dan
and
as
usual
it
was
too
late
at
night
to
call
anyone
and
do
anything
about
it
by
the
morning
have
forgotten
again
from
the
kitchen
lil
barked
back
i
doing
what
i
can
jules
if
you
got
a
better
way
i
love
to
hear
about
it
oh
bullshit
i
doing
what
i
can
planning
the
thing
out
i
ready
to
it
was
your
job
to
get
the
ready
for
it
but
you
keep
telling
me
they
not
when
will
they
be
jesus
you
a
nag
i
would
nag
if
you
only
fucking
make
it
happen
what
are
you
doing
all
day
anyway
working
shifts
at
the
mansion
rearranging
deck
chairs
on
the
great
titanic
adventure
i
working
my
fucking
off
i
spoken
to
every
goddamn
one
of
them
at
least
twice
this
week
about
it
sure
i
hollered
at
the
kitchen
sure
you
have
do
take
my
word
for
it
then
check
my
fucking
phone
logs
she
waited
well
check
them
i
check
them
later
i
said
dreading
where
this
was
going
oh
no
you
she
said
stalking
into
the
room
fuming
you
ca
call
me
a
liar
and
then
refuse
to
look
at
the
evidence
she
planted
her
hands
on
her
slim
little
hips
and
glared
at
me
she
gone
pale
and
i
could
count
every
freckle
on
her
face
her
throat
her
collarbones
the
swell
of
her
cleavage
in
the
old
shirt
given
her
on
a
to
nassau
well
she
asked
she
looked
ready
to
wring
my
neck
i
ca
i
admitted
not
meeting
her
eyes
yes
you
can
here
i
dump
it
to
your
public
directory
her
expression
shifted
to
one
of
puzzlement
when
she
failed
to
locate
me
on
her
network
what
going
on
so
i
told
her
offline
outcast
malfunctioning
well
why
have
you
gone
to
the
doctor
i
mean
it
been
i
call
him
right
now
forget
it
i
said
i
see
him
tomorrow
no
sense
in
getting
him
out
of
bed
but
i
did
see
him
the
day
after
or
the
day
after
that
too
much
to
do
and
the
only
times
i
remembered
to
call
someone
i
was
too
far
from
a
public
terminal
or
it
was
too
late
or
too
early
my
systems
came
online
a
couple
times
and
i
was
too
busy
with
the
plans
for
the
mansion
lil
grew
accustomed
to
the
drifts
of
hard
copy
that
littered
the
house
to
printing
out
her
annotations
to
my
designs
and
leaving
them
on
my
favorite
chair
to
living
like
the
cavemen
of
the
information
age
had
surrounded
by
dead
trees
and
ticking
clocks
being
offline
helped
me
focus
focus
is
hardly
the
word
for
it
i
obsessed
i
sat
in
front
of
the
terminal
i
brought
home
all
day
every
day
crunching
plans
dictating
voicemail
people
who
wanted
to
reach
me
had
to
haul
ass
out
to
the
house
and
to
me
i
grew
too
obsessed
to
fight
and
dan
moved
back
and
then
it
was
my
turn
to
take
hotel
rooms
so
that
the
rattle
of
my
keyboard
would
keep
him
up
nights
he
and
lil
were
working
a
campaign
to
recruit
the
to
our
cause
and
i
started
to
feel
like
we
were
finally
in
harmony
about
to
reach
our
goal
i
went
home
one
afternoon
clutching
a
sheaf
of
hardcopy
and
burst
into
the
living
room
gabbling
a
about
a
wrinkle
on
my
original
plan
that
would
add
a
third
segment
to
the
ride
increasing
the
number
of
telepresence
rigs
we
could
use
without
decreasing
throughput
i
was
when
my
systems
came
back
online
the
public
chatter
in
the
room
sprang
up
on
my
hud
then
i
going
to
tear
off
every
stitch
of
clothing
and
jump
then
what
going
to
bang
you
till
you
limp
lil
you
are
one
rangy
my
eyes
closed
shutting
out
everything
except
for
the
glowing
letters
quickly
they
vanished
i
opened
my
eyes
again
looking
at
lil
who
was
flushed
and
distracted
dan
looked
scared
what
going
on
dan
i
asked
quietly
my
heart
hammered
in
my
chest
but
i
felt
calm
and
detached
jules
he
began
then
gave
up
and
looked
at
lil
lil
had
by
that
time
figured
out
that
i
was
back
online
that
their
secret
messaging
had
been
discovered
having
fun
lil
i
asked
lil
shook
her
head
and
glared
at
me
just
go

send
your
stuff

the
hotel

want
me
to
go
huh

can

house

rehab

julius
dan
began
this
is
between
me
and
him
lil
said
stay
out
of
it
i
dropped
my
papers
i
wanted
to
throw
them
but
i
dropped
them
and
i
turned
on
my
heel
and
walked
out
not
bothering
to
close
the
door
behind
me
dan
showed
up
at
the
hotel
ten
minutes
after
i
did
and
rapped
on
my
door
i
was
numb
as
i
opened
the
door
he
had
a
bottle
of
tequila
tequila
brought
over
from
the
house
that
i
shared
with
lil
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
stared
at
the
wallpaper
i
took
the
bottle
from
him
got
a
couple
glasses
from
the
bathroom
and
poured
it
my
fault
he
said
i
sure
it
is
i
said
we
got
to
drinking
a
couple
nights
ago
she
was
really
upset
seen
you
in
days
and
when
she
see
you
you
freaked
her
out
snapping
at
her
arguing
insulting
her
so
you
made
her
i
said
he
shook
his
head
then
nodded
took
a
drink
i
did
it
been
a
long
time
since
you
had
sex
with
my
girlfriend
in
my
house
while
i
was
away
working
jules
i
sorry
i
did
it
and
i
kept
on
doing
it
i
not
much
of
a
friend
to
either
of
you
she
pretty
broken
up
she
wanted
me
to
come
out
here
and
tell
you
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
you
were
just
being
paranoid
we
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
i
refilled
his
glass
then
my
own
i
could
do
that
he
said
i
worried
about
you
you
have
been
right
not
for
months
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
you
should
get
to
a
doctor
i
do
need
a
doctor
i
snapped
the
liquor
had
melted
the
numbness
and
left
burning
anger
and
bile
my
constant
companions
i
need
a
friend
who
does
fuck
my
girlfriend
when
my
back
is
turned
i
threw
my
glass
at
the
wall
it
bounced
off
leaving
on
the
wallpaper
and
rolled
under
the
bed
dan
started
but
stayed
seated
if
he
stood
up
i
would
hit
him
dan
good
at
crises
if
it
any
consolation
i
expect
to
be
dead
pretty
soon
he
said
he
gave
me
a
wry
grin
my
whuffie
doing
good
this
rehab
should
take
it
up
over
the
top
i
be
ready
to
go
that
stopped
me
i
somehow
managed
to
forget
that
dan
my
good
friend
dan
was
going
to
kill
himself
you
going
to
do
it
i
said
sitting
down
next
to
him
it
hurt
to
think
about
it
i
really
liked
the
bastard
he
might
been
my
best
friend
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
i
opened
it
without
checking
the
peephole
it
was
lil
she
looked
younger
than
ever
young
and
small
and
miserable
a
snide
remark
died
in
my
throat
i
wanted
to
hold
her
she
brushed
past
me
and
went
to
dan
who
squirmed
out
of
her
embrace
no
he
said
and
stood
up
and
sat
on
the
windowsill
staring
down
at
the
seven
seas
lagoon
dan
just
been
explaining
to
me
that
he
plans
on
being
dead
in
a
couple
months
i
said
puts
a
damper
on
the
plans
it
lil
tears
streamed
down
her
face
and
she
seemed
to
fold
in
on
herself
take
what
i
can
get
she
said
i
choked
on
a
knob
of
misery
and
i
realized
that
it
was
dan
not
lil
whose
loss
upset
me
the
most
lil
took
dan
hand
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
guess
i
take
what
i
can
get
i
thought
chapter
lying
on
my
hotel
bed
mesmerized
by
the
lazy
turns
of
the
ceiling
fan
i
pondered
the
possibility
that
i
was
nuts
it
was
unheard
of
even
in
the
days
of
the
bitchun
society
and
even
though
there
were
cures
they
were
pleasant
i
was
once
married
to
a
crazy
person
we
were
both
about
and
i
was
living
for
nothing
but
joy
her
name
was
zoya
and
i
called
her
zed
we
met
in
orbit
where
i
gone
to
experience
the
famed
sybarites
getting
staggering
drunk
is
not
much
fun
at
one
gee
but
at
ten
to
the
neg
eight
it
a
blast
you
do
stagger
you
and
when
you
bouncing
in
a
sphere
full
of
other
bouncing
happy
boisterous
naked
people
things
get
deeply
fun
i
was
bouncing
around
inside
a
clear
sphere
that
was
a
mile
in
diameter
filled
with
smaller
spheres
in
which
one
could
procure
bulbs
of
fruity
deadly
concoctions
musical
instruments
littered
the
sphere
floor
and
if
you
knew
how
to
play
you
snag
one
tether
it
to
you
and
start
playing
others
would
pick
up
their
own
axes
and
jam
along
the
tunes
varied
from
terrific
to
awful
but
they
were
always
energetic
i
had
been
working
on
my
third
symphony
on
and
off
and
whenever
i
thought
i
had
a
nice
bit
nailed
i
spend
some
time
in
the
sphere
playing
it
sometimes
the
strangers
who
jammed
in
gave
me
new
and
interesting
lines
of
inquiry
and
that
was
good
even
when
they
did
playing
an
instrument
was
a
fast
track
to
intriguing
an
interesting
naked
stranger
which
is
how
we
met
she
snagged
a
piano
and
pounded
out
barrelhouse
runs
in
quirky
time
as
i
carried
the
main
thread
of
the
movement
on
a
cello
at
first
it
was
irritating
but
after
a
short
while
i
came
to
a
dawning
comprehension
of
what
she
was
doing
to
my
music
and
it
was
really
i
a
sucker
for
musicians
we
brought
the
session
to
a
crashing
stop
me
bowing
furiously
as
spheres
of
perspiration
beaded
on
my
body
and
floated
gracefully
into
the
hydrotropic
recyclers
she
beating
on
the
like
they
were
the
perp
who
killed
her
partner
i
collapsed
dramatically
as
the
last
note
crashed
through
the
bubble
the
singles
couples
and
groups
stopped
in
midflight
coitus
to
applaud
she
took
a
bow
untethered
herself
from
the
steinway
and
headed
for
the
hatch
i
coiled
my
legs
up
and
did
a
fast
burn
through
the
sphere
desperate
to
reach
the
hatch
before
she
did
i
caught
her
as
she
was
leaving
hey
i
said
that
was
great
i
julius
how
you
doing
she
reached
out
with
both
hands
and
squeezed
my
nose
and
my
unit
simultaneously
not
hard
you
understand
but
playfully
honk
she
said
and
squirmed
through
the
hatch
while
i
gaped
at
my
burgeoning
i
chased
after
her
wait
i
called
as
she
tumbled
through
the
spoke
of
the
station
towards
the
gravity
she
had
a
pianist
body
arms
and
hands
that
stretched
for
impossible
lengths
and
she
used
them
with
a
spacehand
grace
vaulting
herself
forward
at
speed
i
bumbled
after
her
best
as
i
could
on
my
freshman
spacelegs
but
by
the
time
i
reached
the
rim
of
the
station
she
was
gone
i
did
find
her
again
until
the
next
movement
was
done
and
i
went
to
the
bubble
to
try
it
out
on
an
oboe
i
was
just
getting
warmed
up
when
she
passed
through
the
hatch
and
tied
off
to
the
piano
this
time
i
clamped
the
oboe
under
my
arm
and
bopped
over
to
her
before
moistening
the
reed
and
blowing
i
hovered
over
the
piano
top
looking
her
in
the
eye
as
we
jammed
her
mood
that
day
was
time
and
progressions
in
a
feel
that
swung
around
from
blues
to
rock
to
folk
teasing
at
the
edge
of
my
own
melodies
she
noodled
at
me
i
noodled
back
at
her
and
her
eyes
crinkled
charmingly
whenever
i
managed
a
smidge
of
tuneful
wit
she
was
almost
completely
flatchested
and
covered
in
a
fine
red
downy
fur
like
a
chipmunk
it
was
a
jaunter
style
suited
to
the
controlled
life
in
space
fifty
years
later
i
was
dating
lil
another
redhead
but
zed
was
my
first
i
played
and
played
entranced
by
the
fluidity
of
her
movements
at
the
keyboard
her
comical
moues
of
concentration
when
picking
out
a
particularly
kicky
little
riff
when
i
got
tired
i
took
it
to
a
slow
bridge
or
gave
her
a
solo
i
was
going
to
make
this
last
as
long
as
i
could
meanwhile
i
maneuvered
my
way
between
her
and
the
hatch
when
i
blew
the
last
note
i
was
wrung
out
as
a
washcloth
but
i
summoned
the
energy
to
zip
over
to
the
hatch
and
block
it
she
calmly
untied
and
floated
over
to
me
i
looked
in
her
eyes
silvered
slanted
eyes
that
i
been
staring
into
all
afternoon
and
watched
the
smile
that
started
at
their
corners
and
spread
right
down
to
her
long
elegant
toes
she
looked
back
at
me
then
at
length
grabbed
ahold
of
my
joint
again
you
do
she
said
and
led
me
to
her
sleeping
quarters
across
the
station
we
did
sleep
zoya
had
been
an
early
network
engineer
for
the
geosynch
broadband
constellations
that
went
up
at
the
cusp
of
the
world
ascent
into
bitchunry
she
been
exposed
to
a
lot
of
hard
rads
and
low
gee
and
had
generally
become
pretty
transhuman
as
time
went
by
upgrading
with
a
bewildering
array
of
enhancements
a
vestigial
tail
eyes
that
saw
through
most
of
the
rf
spectrum
her
arms
her
fur
dogleg
reversible
knee
joints
and
a
completely
mechanical
spine
that
prone
to
any
of
the
absolutely
inane
bullshit
that
plagues
the
rest
of
us
like
pain
intrascapular
inflammation
sciatica
and
slipped
discs
i
thought
i
lived
for
fun
but
i
did
have
anything
on
zed
she
only
talked
when
honking
and
whistling
and
grabbing
and
kissing
would
do
and
routinely
slapped
upgrades
into
herself
on
the
basis
of
any
whim
that
crossed
her
mind
like
when
she
resolved
to
do
a
spacewalk
skinned
and
spent
the
afternoon
getting
and
i
fell
in
love
with
her
a
hundred
times
a
day
and
wanted
to
strangle
her
twice
as
often
she
stayed
on
her
spacewalk
for
a
couple
of
days
floating
around
the
bubble
making
crazy
faces
at
its
mirrored
exterior
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
if
i
was
inside
but
she
assumed
that
i
was
watching
or
maybe
she
did
and
she
was
making
faces
for
benefit
but
then
she
came
back
through
the
lock
strange
and
wordless
and
her
eyes
full
of
the
stars
she
seen
and
her
metallic
skin
cool
with
the
breath
of
empty
space
and
she
led
me
a
merry
game
of
tag
through
the
station
the
mess
hall
where
we
skidded
sloppy
through
a
wobbly
ovoid
of
rice
pudding
the
greenhouses
where
she
burrowed
like
a
gopher
and
shinnied
like
a
monkey
the
living
quarters
and
bubbles
as
we
interrupted
a
thousand
acts
of
coitus
you
have
thought
that
we
have
followed
it
up
with
an
act
of
our
own
and
truth
be
told
that
was
certainly
my
expectation
when
we
started
the
game
i
came
to
think
of
as
the
steeplechase
but
we
never
did
halfway
through
i
lose
track
of
carnal
urges
and
return
to
a
state
of
childlike
innocence
living
only
for
the
thrill
of
the
chase
and
the
giggly
feeling
i
got
whenever
she
found
some
new
corner
to
turn
i
think
we
became
legendary
on
the
station
that
crazy
pair
that
always
zipping
in
and
zipping
away
like
having
your
party
crashed
by
two
naked
coed
marx
brothers
when
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
to
return
to
earth
with
me
to
live
with
me
until
the
universe
mainspring
unwound
she
laughed
honked
my
nose
and
my
willie
and
shouted
you
i
took
her
home
to
toronto
and
we
took
up
residence
ten
stories
underground
in
overflow
residence
for
the
university
our
whuffie
so
hot
earthside
and
the
endless
institutional
corridors
made
her
feel
at
home
while
affording
her
opportunities
for
mischief
but
bit
by
bit
the
mischief
dwindled
and
she
started
talking
more
at
first
i
admit
i
was
relieved
glad
that
my
strange
silent
wife
was
finally
acting
normal
making
nice
with
the
neighbors
instead
of
pranking
them
with
endless
honks
and
and
squirt
guns
we
gave
up
the
steeplechase
and
she
had
the
doglegs
taken
out
her
fur
removed
her
eyes
unsilvered
to
a
hazel
that
was
pretty
and
as
fathomable
as
the
silver
had
been
inscrutable
we
wore
clothes
we
entertained
i
started
to
rehearse
my
symphony
in
halls
and
parks
with
any
musicians
i
could
drum
up
and
she
came
out
and
did
play
just
sat
to
the
side
and
smiled
and
smiled
with
a
smile
that
never
went
beyond
her
lips
she
went
nuts
she
shat
herself
she
pulled
her
hair
she
cut
herself
with
knives
she
accused
me
of
plotting
to
kill
her
she
set
fire
to
the
apartments
wrapped
herself
in
plastic
sheeting
the
furniture
she
went
nuts
she
did
it
in
broad
strokes
painting
the
walls
of
our
bedroom
with
her
blood
jagging
all
night
through
rant
after
rant
i
smiled
and
nodded
and
faced
it
for
as
long
as
i
could
then
i
grabbed
her
and
hauled
her
kicking
like
a
mule
to
the
doctor
office
on
the
second
floor
she
been
dirtside
for
a
year
and
nuts
for
a
month
but
it
took
me
that
long
to
face
up
to
it
the
doc
diagnosed
nonchemical
dysfunction
which
was
by
way
of
saying
that
it
was
her
mind
not
her
brain
that
was
broken
in
other
words
i
driven
her
nuts
you
can
get
counseling
for
nonchemical
dysfunction
basically
trying
to
talk
it
out
learn
to
feel
better
about
yourself
she
did
want
to
she
was
miserable
suicidal
murderous
in
the
brief
moments
of
lucidity
that
she
had
under
sedation
she
consented
to
being
restored
from
a
backup
that
was
made
before
we
came
to
toronto
i
was
at
her
side
in
the
hospital
when
she
woke
up
i
had
prepared
a
written
synopsis
of
the
events
since
her
last
backup
for
her
and
she
read
it
over
the
next
couple
days
julius
she
said
while
i
was
making
breakfast
in
our
subterranean
apartment
she
sounded
so
serious
so
that
i
knew
immediately
that
the
news
would
be
good
yes
i
said
setting
out
plates
of
bacon
and
eggs
steaming
cups
of
coffee
i
going
to
go
back
to
space
and
revert
to
an
older
version
she
had
a
shoulderbag
packed
and
she
had
traveling
clothes
on
great
i
said
with
forced
cheerfulness
making
a
mental
inventory
of
my
responsibilities
dirtside
give
me
a
minute
or
two
i
pack
up
i
miss
space
too
she
shook
her
head
and
anger
blazed
in
her
utterly
scrutable
hazel
eyes
no
i
going
back
to
who
i
was
before
i
met
you
it
hurt
bad
i
had
loved
the
old
steeplechase
zed
had
loved
her
fun
and
mischief
the
zed
she
become
after
we
wed
was
terrible
and
terrifying
but
i
stuck
with
her
out
of
respect
for
the
person
been
now
she
was
off
to
restore
herself
from
a
backup
made
before
she
met
me
she
was
going
to
lop
months
out
of
her
life
start
over
again
revert
to
a
saved
version
hurt
it
ached
like
a
motherfucker
i
went
back
to
the
station
a
month
later
and
saw
her
jamming
in
the
sphere
with
a
guy
who
had
three
extra
sets
of
arms
depending
from
his
hips
he
scuttled
around
the
sphere
while
she
played
a
jig
on
the
piano
and
when
her
silver
eyes
lit
on
me
there
was
a
shred
of
recognition
in
them
she
never
met
me
i
died
some
too
putting
the
incident
out
of
my
head
and
sojourning
to
disney
world
there
to
reinvent
myself
with
a
new
group
of
friends
a
new
career
a
new
life
i
never
spoke
of
zed
again
especially
not
to
lil
who
hardly
needed
me
to
pollute
her
with
remembrances
of
my
crazy
exes
if
i
was
nuts
it
was
the
kind
of
spectacular
nuts
that
zed
had
gone
it
was
a
slow
seething
ugly
nuts
that
had
me
alienating
my
friends
sabotaging
my
enemies
driving
my
girlfriend
into
my
best
friend
arms
i
decided
that
i
would
see
a
doctor
just
as
soon
as
we
run
the
rehab
past
the
general
meeting
i
had
to
get
my
priorities
straight
i
pulled
on
last
night
clothes
and
walked
out
to
the
monorail
station
in
the
main
lobby
the
platform
was
jammed
with
happy
guests
bright
and
cheerful
and
ready
for
a
day
of
steady
hypermediated
fun
i
tried
to
make
myself
attend
to
them
as
individuals
but
try
as
i
might
they
kept
turning
into
a
crowd
and
i
had
to
plant
my
feet
firmly
on
the
platform
to
keep
from
weaving
among
them
to
the
edge
the
better
to
snag
a
seat
the
meeting
was
being
held
over
the
sunshine
tree
terrace
in
adventureland
just
steps
from
where
i
been
turned
into
a
by
the
assassin
the
adventureland
owed
the
liberty
square
crew
a
favor
since
my
death
had
gone
down
on
their
turf
so
they
had
given
us
use
of
their
prize
meeting
room
where
the
florida
sun
streamed
through
the
slats
of
the
shutters
casting
a
hash
of
filled
shafts
of
light
across
the
room
the
faint
sounds
of
the
drums
and
the
spieling
jungle
cruise
guides
leaked
through
the
room
a
ambient
buzz
from
two
of
the
park
oldest
rides
there
were
almost
a
hundred
in
the
liberty
square
crew
almost
all
castmembers
with
big
friendly
smiles
they
filled
the
room
to
capacity
and
there
was
much
hugging
and
handshaking
before
the
meeting
came
to
order
i
was
thankful
that
the
room
was
too
small
for
the
so
that
lil
was
able
to
stand
at
a
podium
and
command
a
smidge
of
respect
hi
there
she
said
brightly
the
weepy
puffiness
was
still
present
around
her
eyes
if
you
knew
how
to
look
for
it
but
she
was
expert
at
putting
on
a
brave
face
no
matter
what
the
ache
the
roared
back
a
collective
hi
lil
and
laughed
at
their
own
corny
tradition
oh
they
sure
were
a
barrel
of
laughs
at
the
magic
kingdom
everybody
knows
why
we
here
right
lil
said
with
a
deprecating
smile
she
been
lobbying
hard
for
weeks
after
all
does
anyone
have
any
questions
about
the
plans
we
like
to
start
executing
right
away
a
guy
with
deliberately
boyish
wholesome
features
put
his
arm
in
the
air
lil
acknowledged
him
with
a
nod
when
you
say
away
do
you
mean
i
cut
in
tonight
after
this
meeting
we
on
an
production
schedule
and
the
sooner
we
start
the
sooner
it
be
finished
the
crowd
murmured
unsettled
lil
shot
me
a
withering
look
i
shrugged
politics
was
not
my
game
lil
said
don
we
trying
something
new
here
a
really
streamlined
process
the
good
part
is
the
process
is
in
a
couple
months
we
know
if
it
working
for
us
if
it
not
hey
we
can
turn
it
around
in
a
couple
months
too
that
why
we
not
spending
as
much
time
planning
as
we
usually
do
it
wo
take
five
years
for
the
idea
to
prove
out
so
the
risks
are
lower
another
castmember
a
woman
apparent
with
a
round
motherly
demeanor
said
i
all
for
moving
fast
lord
knows
our
pacing
has
always
been
that
hot
but
i
concerned
about
all
these
new
people
you
propose
to
recruit
wo
having
more
people
slow
us
down
when
it
comes
to
making
new
decisions
i
thought
sourly
the
people
i
bringing
in
addicted
to
lil
nodded
that
a
good
point
lisa
the
offer
we
making
to
the
telepresence
players
is
probationary
they
do
get
to
vote
until
after
we
agreed
that
the
rehab
is
a
success
another
castmember
stood
i
recognized
him
dave
a
heavyset
important
jerk
who
loved
to
work
the
front
door
even
though
he
blew
his
spiel
about
half
the
time
lillian
he
said
smiling
sadly
at
her
i
think
you
really
making
a
big
mistake
here
we
love
the
mansion
all
of
us
and
so
do
the
guests
it
a
piece
of
history
and
we
its
custodians
not
its
masters
changing
it
like
this
well
he
shook
his
head
it
not
good
stewardship
if
the
guests
wanted
to
walk
through
a
funhouse
with
guys
jumping
out
of
the
shadows
saying
booga
they
go
to
one
of
the
halloween
houses
in
their
hometowns
the
mansion
better
than
that
i
ca
be
a
part
of
this
plan
i
wanted
to
knock
the
smug
grin
off
his
face
i
delivered
essentially
the
same
polemic
a
thousand
times
in
reference
to
debra
work
and
hearing
it
from
this
jerk
in
reference
to
made
me
go
all
hot
and
red
inside
look
i
said
if
we
do
do
this
if
we
do
change
things
get
changed
us
by
someone
else
the
question
is
whether
a
responsible
custodian
lets
his
custodianship
be
taken
away
from
him
or
whether
he
does
everything
he
can
to
make
sure
that
he
still
around
to
ensure
that
his
charge
is
properly
cared
for
good
custodianship
is
sticking
your
head
in
the
sand
i
could
tell
i
was
doing
any
good
the
mood
of
the
crowd
was
getting
darker
the
faces
more
set
i
resolved
not
to
speak
again
until
the
meeting
was
done
no
matter
what
the
provocation
lil
smoothed
my
remarks
over
and
fielded
a
dozen
more
and
it
looked
like
the
objections
would
continue
all
afternoon
and
all
night
and
all
the
next
day
and
i
felt
woozy
and
overwrought
and
miserable
all
at
the
same
time
staring
at
lil
and
her
harried
smile
and
her
nervous
smoothing
of
her
hair
over
her
ears
finally
she
called
the
question
by
tradition
the
votes
were
collected
in
secret
and
publicly
tabulated
over
the
the
eyes
unfocussed
as
they
called
up
huds
and
watched
the
totals
as
they
rolled
in
i
was
offline
and
unable
to
vote
or
watch
at
length
lil
heaved
a
relieved
sigh
and
smiled
dropping
her
hands
behind
her
back
all
right
then
she
said
over
the
crowd
buzz
let
get
to
work
i
stood
up
saw
dan
and
lil
staring
into
each
other
eyes
a
meaningful
glance
between
new
lovers
and
i
saw
red
literally
my
vision
washed
over
pink
and
a
strobe
pounded
at
the
edges
of
my
vision
i
took
two
lumbering
steps
towards
them
and
opened
my
mouth
to
say
something
horrible
and
what
came
out
was
waaagh
my
right
side
went
numb
and
my
leg
slipped
out
from
under
me
and
i
crashed
to
the
floor
the
slatted
light
from
the
shutters
cast
its
way
across
my
chest
as
i
tried
to
struggle
up
with
my
left
arm
and
then
it
all
went
black
i
was
nuts
after
all
the
doctor
office
in
the
main
street
infirmary
was
clean
and
white
and
decorated
with
posters
of
jiminy
cricket
in
doctors
whites
with
an
outsized
stethoscope
i
came
to
on
a
hard
pallet
under
a
sign
that
reminded
me
to
get
a
twice
a
year
by
gum
and
i
tried
to
bring
my
hands
up
to
shield
my
eyes
from
the
over
bright
light
and
the
cheerful
signage
and
discovered
that
i
could
move
my
arms
further
investigation
revealed
that
this
was
because
i
was
strapped
down
in
restraint
waaagh
i
said
again
dan
worried
face
swam
into
my
field
of
vision
along
with
a
looking
doctor
apparent
with
a
norman
rockwell
face
full
of
and
welcome
back
julius
i
doctor
pete
the
doctor
said
in
a
kindly
voice
that
matched
the
face
despite
my
recent
disillusion
with
castmember
bullshit
i
found
his
schtick
comforting
i
slumped
back
against
the
palette
while
the
doc
shone
lights
in
my
eyes
and
consulted
various
diagnostic
apparati
i
bore
it
in
stoic
silence
too
confounded
by
the
horrible
waaagh
sounds
to
attempt
more
speech
the
doc
would
tell
me
what
was
going
on
when
he
was
ready
does
he
need
to
be
tied
up
still
dan
asked
and
i
shook
my
head
urgently
being
tied
up
was
my
idea
of
a
good
time
the
doc
smiled
kindly
i
think
it
for
the
best
for
now
do
worry
julius
we
have
you
up
and
about
soon
enough
dan
protested
but
stopped
when
the
doc
threatened
to
send
him
out
of
the
room
he
took
my
hand
instead
my
nose
itched
i
tried
to
ignore
it
but
it
got
worse
and
worse
until
it
was
all
i
could
think
of
the
flaming
lance
of
itch
that
strobed
at
the
tip
of
my
nostril
furiously
i
wrinkled
my
face
rattled
at
my
restraints
the
doc
absentmindedly
noticed
my
gyrations
and
delicately
scratched
my
nose
with
a
gloved
finger
the
relief
was
fantastic
i
just
hoped
my
nuts
did
start
itching
anytime
soon
finally
the
doctor
pulled
up
a
chair
and
did
something
that
caused
the
head
of
the
bed
to
raise
up
so
that
i
could
look
him
in
the
eye
well
now
he
said
stroking
his
chin
julius
you
got
a
problem
your
friend
here
tells
me
your
systems
have
been
offline
for
more
than
a
month
it
sure
would
been
better
if
you
come
in
to
see
me
when
it
started
up
but
you
did
and
things
got
worse
he
nodded
up
at
jiminy
recriminations
go
ahead
see
your
doc
it
good
advice
son
but
what
done
is
done
you
were
restored
from
a
backup
about
eight
weeks
ago
i
see
without
more
tests
i
ca
be
sure
but
my
theory
is
that
the
interface
they
installed
at
that
time
had
a
material
defect
it
been
deteriorating
ever
since
misfiring
and
rebooting
the
are
a
protective
mechanism
meant
to
keep
it
from
introducing
the
kind
of
seizure
you
experienced
this
afternoon
when
the
interface
senses
malfunction
it
shuts
itself
down
and
boots
a
diagnostic
mode
attempts
to
fix
itself
and
come
back
online
well
that
fine
for
minor
problems
but
in
cases
like
this
it
bad
news
the
interface
has
been
deteriorating
steadily
and
it
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
does
some
serious
damage
waaagh
i
asked
i
meant
to
say
right
but
what
wrong
with
my
mouth
the
doc
put
a
finger
to
my
lips
do
try
the
interface
has
locked
up
and
it
taken
some
of
your
voluntary
nervous
processes
with
it
in
time
it
probably
shut
down
but
for
now
there
no
point
why
we
got
you
strapped
down
you
were
thrashing
pretty
hard
when
they
brought
you
in
and
we
did
want
you
to
hurt
yourself
shut
jesus
i
could
end
up
stuck
like
this
forever
i
started
shaking
the
doc
soothed
me
stroking
my
hand
and
in
the
process
pressed
a
transdermal
on
my
wrist
the
panic
receded
as
the
transdermal
sedative
oozed
into
my
bloodstream
there
there
he
said
it
nothing
permanent
we
can
grow
you
a
new
clone
and
refresh
it
from
your
last
backup
unfortunately
that
backup
is
a
few
months
old
if
we
caught
it
earlier
we
may
been
able
to
salvage
a
current
backup
but
given
the
deterioration
you
displayed
to
date
well
there
just
would
be
any
point
my
heart
hammered
i
was
going
to
lose
two
months
lose
it
all
never
happened
my
assassination
the
new
hall
of
presidents
and
my
shameful
attempt
thereon
the
fights
with
lil
lil
and
dan
the
meeting
my
plans
for
the
rehab
all
of
it
good
and
bad
every
moment
flensed
away
i
could
do
it
i
had
a
rehab
to
finish
and
i
was
the
only
one
who
understood
how
it
had
to
be
done
without
my
relentless
prodding
the
would
surely
revert
to
their
old
safe
ways
they
might
even
leave
it
halt
the
process
for
an
interminable
review
present
a
soft
belly
for
debra
to
savage
i
would
be
restoring
from
backup
i
had
two
more
seizures
before
the
interface
finally
gave
up
and
shut
itself
down
i
remember
the
first
a
confusion
of
strobes
and
uncontrollable
thrashing
and
the
taste
of
copper
but
the
second
happened
without
waking
me
from
deep
unconsciousness
when
i
came
to
again
in
the
infirmary
dan
was
still
there
he
had
a
day
growth
of
beard
and
new
worrylines
at
the
corners
of
his
newly
rejuvenated
eyes
the
doctor
came
in
shaking
his
head
well
now
it
seems
like
the
worst
is
over
i
drawn
up
the
consent
forms
for
the
refresh
and
the
new
clone
will
be
ready
in
an
hour
or
two
in
the
meantime
i
think
heavy
sedation
is
in
order
once
the
been
completed
we
retire
this
body
for
you
and
we
be
all
finished
up
retire
this
body
kill
me
is
what
it
meant
no
i
said
i
thrilled
in
my
restraints
my
voice
was
back
under
my
control
oh
really
now
the
doc
lost
his
bedside
manner
let
his
exasperation
slip
through
there
nothing
else
for
it
if
you
come
to
me
when
it
all
started
well
we
might
had
other
options
you
got
no
one
to
blame
but
yourself
no
i
repeated
not
now
i
wo
sign
dan
put
his
hand
on
mine
i
tried
to
jerk
out
from
under
it
but
the
restraints
and
his
grip
held
me
fast
you
got
to
do
it
julius
for
the
best
he
said
i
not
going
to
let
you
kill
me
i
said
through
clenched
teeth
his
fingertips
were
callused
worked
rough
with
exertion
well
beyond
the
normal
call
of
duty
no
one
killing
you
son
the
doctor
said
son
son
son
who
knew
how
old
he
was
he
could
be
for
all
i
knew
it
just
the
opposite
we
saving
you
if
you
continue
like
this
it
will
only
get
worse
the
seizures
mental
breakdown
the
whole
melon
going
soft
you
do
want
that
i
thought
of
zed
spectacular
transformation
into
a
crazy
person
i
sure
i
do
care
about
the
interface
chop
it
out
i
do
it
now
i
swallowed
later
after
the
rehab
eight
more
weeks
the
irony
once
the
doc
knew
i
was
serious
he
sent
dan
out
of
the
room
and
rolled
his
eyes
up
while
he
placed
a
call
i
saw
his
gorge
work
as
he
subvocalized
he
left
me
bound
to
the
table
to
wait
no
clocks
in
the
infirmary
and
no
internal
clock
and
it
may
have
been
ten
minutes
or
five
hours
i
was
catheterized
but
i
did
know
it
until
urgent
necessity
made
the
discovery
for
me
when
the
doc
came
back
he
held
a
small
device
that
i
instantly
recognized
a
herf
gun
oh
it
was
the
same
model
i
used
on
the
hall
of
presidents
this
one
was
smaller
and
better
made
with
the
precise
engineering
of
a
surgical
tool
the
doc
raised
his
eyebrows
at
me
you
know
what
this
is
he
said
flatly
a
dim
corner
of
my
mind
gibbered
knows
he
knows
the
hall
of
but
he
did
know
that
episode
was
locked
in
my
mind
invulnerable
to
backup
i
know
i
said
this
one
is
in
the
extreme
it
will
penetrate
the
interface
shielding
and
fuse
it
it
probably
wo
turn
you
into
a
vegetable
that
the
best
i
can
do
if
this
fails
we
will
restore
you
from
your
last
backup
you
have
to
sign
the
consent
before
i
use
it
he
dropped
all
kindly
pretense
from
his
voice
not
bothering
to
disguise
his
disgust
i
was
pitching
out
the
miracle
of
the
bitchun
society
the
thing
that
had
all
but
obsoleted
the
medical
profession
why
bother
with
surgery
when
you
can
grow
a
clone
take
a
backup
and
refresh
the
new
body
some
people
swapped
corpuses
just
to
get
rid
of
a
cold
i
signed
the
doc
wheeled
my
gurney
into
the
crash
and
hum
of
the
utilidors
and
then
put
it
on
a
freight
tram
that
ran
to
the
imagineering
compound
and
thence
to
a
heavy
exposed
faraday
cage
of
course
using
the
herf
on
me
would
kill
any
electronics
in
the
neighborhood
they
had
to
shield
me
before
they
pulled
the
trigger
the
doc
placed
the
gun
on
my
chest
and
loosened
my
restraints
he
sealed
the
cage
and
retreated
to
the
lab
door
he
pulled
a
heavy
apron
and
helmet
with
faceguard
from
a
hook
beside
the
door
once
i
am
outside
the
door
point
it
at
your
head
and
pull
the
trigger
i
come
back
in
five
minutes
once
i
am
in
the
room
place
the
gun
on
the
floor
and
do
not
touch
it
it
is
only
good
for
a
single
usage
but
i
have
no
desire
to
find
out
i
wrong
he
closed
the
door
i
took
the
pistol
in
my
hand
it
was
heavy
dense
with
its
stored
energy
the
tip
a
parabolic
hollow
to
better
focus
its
cone
i
lifted
the
gun
to
my
temple
and
let
it
rest
there
my
thumb
found
the
i
paused
this
would
kill
me
but
it
might
lock
the
interface
forever
paralyzing
me
turning
me
into
a
thrashing
maniac
i
knew
that
i
would
never
be
able
to
pull
the
trigger
the
doc
must
known
too
this
was
his
way
of
convincing
me
to
let
him
do
that
restore
i
opened
my
mouth
to
call
the
doc
and
what
came
out
was
waaagh
the
seizure
started
my
arm
jerked
and
my
thumb
nailed
the
stud
and
there
was
an
ozone
tang
the
seizure
stopped
i
had
no
more
interface
the
doc
looked
sour
and
pinched
when
he
saw
me
sitting
up
on
the
gurney
rubbing
at
my
biceps
he
produced
a
handheld
diagnostic
tool
and
pointed
it
at
my
melon
then
pronounced
every
bit
of
digital
microcircuitry
in
it
dead
for
the
first
time
since
my
twenties
i
was
no
more
advanced
than
nature
had
made
me
the
restraints
left
purple
bruises
at
my
wrists
and
ankles
where
thrashed
against
them
i
hobbled
out
of
the
faraday
cage
and
the
lab
under
my
own
power
but
just
barely
my
muscles
groaning
from
the
inadvertent
isometric
exercises
of
my
seizure
dan
was
waiting
in
the
utilidor
crouched
and
dozing
against
the
wall
the
doc
shook
him
awake
and
his
head
snapped
up
his
hand
catching
the
doc
in
a
reflex
it
was
easy
to
forget
dan
old
line
of
work
here
in
the
magic
kingdom
but
when
he
smoothly
snagged
the
doc
arm
and
sprang
to
his
feet
eyes
hard
and
alert
i
remembered
my
old
pal
the
action
hero
quickly
dan
released
the
doc
and
apologized
he
assessed
my
physical
state
and
wordlessly
wedged
his
shoulder
in
my
armpit
supporting
me
i
did
have
the
strength
to
stop
him
i
needed
sleep
i
taking
you
home
he
said
we
fight
debra
off
tomorrow
sure
i
said
and
boarded
the
waiting
tram
but
we
did
go
home
dan
took
me
back
to
my
hotel
the
contemporary
and
brought
me
up
to
my
door
he
keycarded
the
lock
and
stood
awkwardly
as
i
hobbled
into
the
empty
room
that
was
my
new
home
as
i
collapsed
into
the
bed
that
was
mine
now
with
an
apologetic
look
he
slunk
away
back
to
lil
and
the
house
shared
i
slapped
on
a
sedative
transdermal
that
the
doc
had
given
me
and
added
a
that
he
recommended
to
control
my
personality
swings
in
seconds
i
was
asleep
chapter
the
meds
helped
me
cope
with
the
next
couple
of
days
starting
the
rehab
on
the
mansion
we
worked
all
night
erecting
a
scaffolding
around
the
facade
though
no
real
work
would
be
done
on
it
we
wanted
the
appearance
of
rapid
progress
and
besides
i
had
an
idea
i
worked
alongside
dan
using
him
as
a
personal
secretary
handling
my
calls
looking
up
plans
monitoring
the
net
for
the
first
grumblings
as
the
public
realized
that
the
mansion
was
being
taken
down
for
a
rehab
we
did
exchange
any
unnecessary
words
standing
side
by
side
without
ever
looking
into
one
another
eyes
i
could
really
feel
awkward
around
dan
anyway
he
never
let
me
and
besides
we
had
our
hands
full
directing
disappointed
guests
away
from
the
mansion
a
depressing
number
of
them
headed
straight
for
the
hall
of
presidents
we
did
have
to
wait
long
for
the
first
panicked
screed
about
the
mansion
to
appear
dan
read
it
aloud
off
his
hud
hey
anyone
hear
anything
about
scheduled
maintenance
at
the
hm
i
just
buzzed
by
on
the
way
to
the
new
h
of
p
and
it
looks
like
some
big
stuff
afoot
scaffolding
castmembers
swarming
in
and
out
see
the
pic
i
hope
they
not
screwing
up
a
good
thing
btw
do
miss
the
new
h
of
very
bitchun
right
i
said
who
the
author
and
is
he
on
the
list
dan
cogitated
a
moment
is
kim
wright
and
she
on
the
list
good
whuffie
lots
of
mansion
fanac
big
readership
call
her
i
said
this
was
the
plan
recruit
rabid
fans
right
away
get
in
costume
and
put
up
on
the
scaffolds
give
them
outsized
tools
and
get
them
to
play
at
construction
activity
in
thumpy
undead
pantomime
in
time
suneep
and
his
gang
would
have
a
batch
of
telepresence
robots
up
and
running
and
we
move
to
them
get
them
wandering
the
queue
area
interacting
with
curious
guests
the
new
mansion
would
be
open
for
business
in
hours
albeit
in
fashion
the
scaffolding
made
for
a
nice
weenie
a
visual
draw
that
would
pull
the
hordes
that
thronged
debra
hall
of
presidents
over
for
a
curious
peek
or
two
buzz
city
i
a
pretty
smart
guy
dan
paged
this
kim
person
and
spoke
to
her
as
she
was
debarking
the
pirates
of
the
caribbean
i
wondered
if
she
was
the
right
person
for
the
job
she
seemed
awfully
enamored
of
the
rehabs
that
debra
and
her
crew
had
performed
if
i
had
more
time
i
would
run
a
deep
background
check
on
every
one
of
the
names
on
my
list
but
that
would
taken
months
dan
made
some
small
talk
with
kim
speaking
aloud
in
deference
to
my
handicap
before
coming
to
the
point
we
read
your
post
about
the
mansion
rehab
you
the
first
one
to
notice
it
and
we
wondered
if
you
be
interested
in
coming
by
to
find
out
a
little
more
about
our
plans
dan
winced
she
a
screamer
he
whispered
reflexively
i
tried
to
pull
up
a
hud
with
my
files
on
the
mansion
fans
we
hoped
to
recruit
of
course
nothing
happened
i
done
that
a
dozen
times
that
morning
and
there
was
no
end
in
sight
i
could
seem
to
get
lathered
up
about
it
though
nor
about
anything
else
not
even
the
hickey
just
visible
under
dan
collar
the
transdermal
on
my
bicep
was
seeing
to
that
doctor
orders
fine
fine
we
standing
by
the
pet
cemetery
two
cast
members
male
in
mansion
costumes
about
apparent
you
ca
miss
us
she
did
she
arrived
out
of
breath
and
excited
jogging
she
was
apparent
and
dressed
like
a
real
year
old
in
a
hipster
control
cowl
that
clung
to
and
released
her
limbs
which
were
long
and
all
the
rage
among
the
younger
set
including
the
girl
who
shot
me
but
the
resemblance
to
my
killer
ended
with
her
dress
and
body
she
was
wearing
a
designer
face
rather
one
that
had
enough
imperfections
to
be
the
one
she
was
born
with
eyes
set
close
and
nose
wide
and
slightly
squashed
i
admired
the
way
she
moved
through
the
crowd
fast
and
low
but
without
jostling
anyone
kim
i
called
as
she
drew
near
over
here
she
gave
a
happy
shriek
and
made
a
beeline
for
us
even
charging
bore
she
was
good
enough
at
navigating
the
crowd
that
she
did
brush
against
a
single
soul
when
she
reached
us
she
came
up
short
and
bounced
a
little
hi
i
kim
she
said
pumping
my
arm
with
the
peculiar
violence
of
the
julius
i
said
then
waited
while
she
repeated
the
process
with
dan
so
she
said
what
the
deal
i
took
her
hand
kim
we
got
a
job
for
you
if
you
interested
she
squeezed
my
hand
hard
and
her
eyes
shone
i
take
it
she
said
i
laughed
and
so
did
dan
it
was
a
polite
castmembery
sort
of
laugh
but
underneath
it
was
relief
i
think
i
better
explain
it
to
you
first
i
said
explain
away
she
said
and
gave
my
hand
another
squeeze
i
let
go
of
her
hand
and
ran
down
an
abbreviated
version
of
the
rehab
plans
leaving
out
anything
about
debra
and
her
kim
drank
it
all
in
greedily
she
cocked
her
head
at
me
as
i
ran
it
down
eyes
wide
it
was
disconcerting
and
i
finally
asked
are
you
recording
this
kim
blushed
i
hope
that
okay
i
starting
a
new
mansion
scrapbook
i
have
one
for
every
ride
in
the
park
but
this
one
gon
na
be
a
beater
here
was
something
i
had
thought
about
publishing
business
was
tabu
inside
park
so
much
so
that
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
the
new
castmembers
we
brought
in
would
want
to
record
every
little
detail
and
push
it
out
over
the
net
as
a
big
old
whuffie
collector
i
can
switch
it
off
kim
said
she
looked
worried
and
i
really
started
to
grasp
how
important
the
mansion
was
to
the
people
we
were
recruiting
how
much
of
a
privilege
we
were
offering
them
leave
it
rolling
i
said
let
show
the
world
how
it
done
we
led
kim
into
a
utilidor
and
down
to
costuming
she
was
by
the
time
we
got
there
literally
tearing
off
her
clothes
in
anticipation
of
getting
into
character
sonya
a
liberty
square
that
stashed
at
costuming
already
had
clothes
waiting
for
her
a
rotting
maid
uniform
with
an
oversized
toolbelt
we
left
kim
on
the
scaffolding
energetically
troweling
a
cement
substitute
onto
the
wall
scraping
it
off
and
moving
to
a
new
spot
it
looked
boring
to
me
but
i
could
believe
that
we
have
to
tear
her
away
when
the
time
came
we
went
back
to
trawling
the
net
for
the
next
candidate
by
lunchtime
there
were
ten
drilling
hammering
troweling
new
castmembers
around
the
scaffolding
pushing
black
wheelbarrows
singing
grim
grinning
ghosts
and
generally
having
a
high
old
time
this
do
i
said
to
dan
i
was
exhausted
and
soaked
with
sweat
and
the
transdermal
under
my
costume
itched
despite
the
in
my
bloodstream
a
streak
of
uncastmemberly
crankiness
was
shot
through
my
mood
i
needed
to
get
offstage
dan
helped
me
hobble
away
and
as
we
hit
the
utilidor
he
whispered
in
my
ear
this
was
a
great
idea
julius
really
we
jumped
a
tram
over
to
imagineering
my
chest
swollen
with
pride
suneep
had
three
of
his
assistants
working
on
the
first
generation
of
mobile
telepresence
robots
for
the
exterior
and
had
promised
a
prototype
for
that
afternoon
the
robots
were
easy
enough
just
stuff
really
but
the
costumes
and
kinematics
routines
were
something
else
thinking
about
what
he
and
suneep
gang
of
hypercreative
would
come
up
with
cheered
me
up
a
little
as
did
being
out
of
the
public
eye
suneep
lab
looked
like
it
had
been
hit
by
a
tornado
imagineer
packs
rolled
in
and
out
with
arcane
gizmos
or
formed
tight
argumentative
knots
in
the
corners
as
they
shouted
over
whatever
their
huds
were
displaying
in
the
middle
of
it
all
was
suneep
who
looked
like
he
was
barely
restraining
an
urge
to
shout
yippee
he
was
clearly
in
his
element
he
threw
his
arms
open
when
he
caught
sight
of
dan
and
me
threw
them
wide
enough
to
embrace
the
whole
mad
gibbering
chaos
what
wonderful
flumgubbery
he
shouted
over
the
noise
sure
is
i
agreed
how
the
prototype
coming
suneep
waved
absently
his
short
fingers
describing
trivialities
in
the
air
in
due
time
in
due
time
i
put
that
team
onto
something
else
a
kinematics
routine
for
a
class
of
flying
spooks
that
use
gasbags
to
stay
aloft
silent
and
scary
it
old
and
the
coming
tremendously
take
a
look
he
pointed
a
finger
at
me
and
presumably
squirted
some
data
my
way
i
offline
i
reminded
him
gently
he
slapped
his
forehead
took
a
moment
to
push
his
hair
off
his
face
and
gave
me
an
apologetic
wave
of
course
of
course
here
he
unrolled
an
lcd
and
handed
it
to
me
a
flock
of
spooks
danced
on
the
screen
rendered
against
the
ballroom
scene
they
were
thematically
consistent
with
the
existing
mansion
ghosts
more
funny
than
scary
and
their
faces
were
familiar
i
looked
around
the
lab
and
realized
that
they
caricatured
various
imagineers
ah
you
noticed
suneep
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
a
very
good
joke
yes
this
is
terrific
i
said
carefully
but
i
really
need
some
robots
up
and
running
by
tomorrow
night
suneep
we
discussed
this
remember
without
telepresence
robots
my
recruiting
would
be
limited
to
fans
like
kim
who
lived
in
the
area
i
had
broader
designs
than
that
suneep
looked
disappointed
of
course
we
discussed
it
i
do
like
to
stop
my
people
when
they
have
good
ideas
but
there
a
time
and
a
place
i
put
them
on
it
right
away
leave
it
to
me
dan
turned
to
greet
someone
and
i
looked
to
see
who
it
was
lil
of
course
she
was
with
fatigue
and
she
reached
out
for
hand
saw
me
and
changed
her
mind
hi
guys
she
said
with
studied
casualness
oh
hello
said
suneep
he
fired
his
finger
at
her
the
flying
ghosts
i
imagined
lil
eyes
rolled
up
for
a
moment
then
she
nodded
exhaustedly
at
him
very
good
she
said
i
just
heard
from
lisa
she
says
the
indoor
crews
are
they
got
most
of
the
animatronics
dismantled
and
they
taking
down
the
glass
in
the
ballroom
now
the
ballroom
ghost
effects
were
accomplished
by
means
of
a
giant
pane
of
polished
glass
that
laterally
bisected
the
room
the
mansion
had
been
built
around
it
it
was
too
big
to
take
out
in
one
piece
they
say
it
be
a
couple
days
before
they
got
it
cut
up
and
ready
to
remove
a
pocket
of
uncomfortable
silence
descended
on
us
the
roar
of
the
imagineers
rushing
in
to
fill
it
you
must
be
exhausted
dan
said
at
length
goddamn
right
i
said
at
the
same
moment
that
lil
said
i
guess
i
am
we
both
smiled
wanly
suneep
put
his
arms
around
lil
and
my
shoulders
and
squeezed
he
smelled
of
an
exotic
cocktail
of
industrial
lubricant
ozone
and
fatigue
poisons
you
two
should
go
home
and
give
each
other
a
massage
he
said
earned
some
rest
dan
met
my
eye
and
shook
his
head
apologetically
i
squirmed
out
from
under
suneep
arm
and
thanked
him
quietly
then
slunk
off
to
the
contemporary
for
a
hot
tub
and
a
couple
hours
of
sleep
i
came
back
to
the
mansion
at
sundown
it
was
cool
enough
that
i
took
a
surface
route
costume
rolled
in
a
shoulderbag
instead
of
riding
through
the
clattering
comfort
of
the
utilidors
as
a
freshening
breeze
blew
across
me
i
suddenly
had
a
craving
for
weather
the
kind
of
climate
i
grown
up
with
in
toronto
it
was
october
for
chrissakes
and
a
lifetime
of
conditioning
told
me
that
it
was
may
i
stopped
and
leaned
on
a
bench
for
a
moment
and
closed
my
eyes
unbidden
and
with
the
clarity
of
a
hud
i
saw
high
park
in
toronto
clothed
in
its
autumn
colors
fiery
reds
and
oranges
shades
of
evergreen
and
earthy
brown
god
i
needed
a
vacation
i
opened
my
eyes
and
realized
that
i
was
standing
in
front
of
the
hall
of
presidents
and
that
there
was
a
queue
ahead
of
me
for
it
one
that
stretched
back
and
back
i
did
a
quick
sum
in
my
head
and
sucked
air
between
my
teeth
they
had
enough
people
for
five
or
six
full
houses
waiting
here
easily
an
hour
wait
the
hall
drew
crowds
like
this
debra
was
working
the
turnstiles
in
betsy
ross
gingham
and
she
caught
my
eye
and
snapped
a
nod
at
me
i
stalked
off
to
the
mansion
a
choir
of
new
recruits
had
formed
up
in
front
of
the
gate
and
were
groaning
their
way
through
grim
grinning
ghosts
with
a
new
structure
a
small
audience
participated
urged
on
by
the
recruits
on
the
scaffolding
well
at
least
that
going
right
i
muttered
to
myself
and
it
was
except
that
i
could
see
members
of
the
looking
on
from
the
sidelines
and
the
looks
were
kindly
totally
obsessive
fans
are
a
good
measure
of
a
ride
popularity
but
they
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
too
they
lipsynch
the
soundtrack
cadge
souvenirs
and
pester
you
with
smarmy
questions
after
a
while
even
the
cheeriest
castmember
starts
to
lose
patience
develop
an
automatic
distaste
for
them
the
liberty
square
who
were
working
on
the
mansion
had
been
railroaded
into
approving
a
rehab
into
working
on
it
and
were
now
forced
to
endure
the
company
of
these
grandstanding
megafans
if
i
been
there
when
it
all
started
instead
of
sleeping
i
may
been
able
to
massage
their
bruised
egos
but
now
i
wondered
if
it
was
too
late
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
it
i
ducked
into
a
utilidor
changed
into
my
costume
and
went
back
onstage
i
joined
the
enthusiastically
walking
around
to
the
and
getting
them
to
join
in
reluctantly
or
otherwise
by
the
time
the
choir
retired
sweaty
and
exhausted
a
group
of
were
ready
to
take
their
place
and
i
escorted
my
recruits
to
an
offstage
suneep
did
deliver
the
robot
prototypes
for
a
week
and
told
me
that
it
would
be
another
week
before
i
could
have
even
five
production
units
though
he
did
say
it
i
got
the
sense
that
his
guys
were
out
of
control
so
excited
by
the
freedom
from
oversight
that
they
were
running
wild
suneep
himself
was
nearly
a
wreck
nervous
and
jumpy
i
did
press
it
besides
i
had
problems
of
my
own
the
new
recruits
were
multiplying
i
was
staying
on
top
of
the
fan
response
to
the
rehab
from
a
terminal
had
installed
in
my
hotel
room
kim
and
her
local
colleagues
were
fielding
millions
of
hits
every
day
their
whuffie
accumulating
as
envious
fans
around
the
world
logged
in
to
watch
their
progress
on
the
scaffolding
that
was
all
according
to
plan
what
was
according
to
plan
was
that
the
new
recruits
were
doing
their
own
recruiting
extending
invitations
to
their
to
come
on
down
to
florida
bunk
on
their
sofas
and
and
present
themselves
to
me
for
active
duty
the
tenth
time
it
happened
i
approached
kim
in
the
her
gorge
was
working
her
eyes
tracked
invisible
words
across
the
middle
distance
no
doubt
she
was
penning
yet
another
breathless
missive
about
the
magic
of
working
in
the
mansion
hey
there
i
said
have
you
got
a
minute
to
meet
with
me
she
held
up
a
single
finger
then
a
moment
later
gave
me
a
bright
smile
hi
julius
she
said
sure
why
do
you
change
into
civvies
we
take
a
walk
through
the
park
and
talk
kim
wore
her
costume
every
chance
she
got
i
been
quite
firm
about
her
turning
it
in
to
the
laundry
every
night
instead
of
wearing
it
home
reluctantly
she
stepped
into
a
and
switched
into
her
cowl
we
took
the
utilidor
to
the
fantasyland
exit
and
walked
through
the
rush
of
children
and
their
adults
queued
deep
and
thick
for
snow
white
dumbo
and
peter
pan
how
you
liking
it
here
i
asked
kim
gave
a
little
bounce
oh
julius
it
the
best
time
of
my
life
really
a
dream
come
true
i
meeting
so
many
interesting
people
and
i
really
feeling
creative
i
ca
wait
to
try
out
the
telepresence
rigs
too
well
i
really
pleased
with
what
you
and
your
friends
are
up
to
here
you
working
hard
putting
on
a
good
show
i
like
the
songs
been
working
up
too
she
did
one
of
those
shuffles
that
was
the
basis
of
any
number
of
action
vids
those
days
and
she
was
suddenly
standing
in
front
of
me
hand
on
my
shoulder
looking
into
my
eyes
she
looked
serious
is
there
a
problem
julius
if
there
is
i
rather
we
just
talked
about
it
instead
of
making
chitchat
i
smiled
and
took
her
hand
off
my
shoulder
how
old
are
you
kim
nineteen
she
said
what
the
problem
nineteen
jesus
no
wonder
she
was
so
volatile
my
excuse
then
it
not
a
problem
kim
it
just
something
i
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
the
people
have
been
bringing
down
to
work
for
me
all
really
great
castmembers
but
but
we
have
limited
resources
around
here
not
enough
hours
in
the
day
for
me
to
stay
on
top
of
the
new
folks
the
rehab
everything
not
to
mention
that
until
we
open
the
new
mansion
there
a
limited
number
of
extras
we
can
use
out
front
i
concerned
that
we
going
to
put
someone
on
stage
without
proper
training
or
that
we
going
to
run
out
of
uniforms
i
also
concerned
about
people
coming
all
the
way
here
and
discovering
that
there
are
any
shifts
for
them
to
take
she
gave
me
a
relieved
look
is
all
do
worry
about
it
been
talking
to
debra
over
at
the
hall
of
presidents
and
she
says
she
can
pick
up
any
people
who
ca
be
used
at
the
mansion
we
could
even
rotate
back
and
forth
she
was
clearly
proud
of
her
foresight
my
ears
buzzed
debra
one
step
ahead
of
me
all
along
the
way
she
probably
suggested
that
kim
do
some
extra
recruiting
in
the
first
place
she
take
in
the
people
who
came
down
to
work
the
mansion
convince
them
they
been
hard
done
by
the
liberty
square
crew
and
rope
them
into
her
little
whuffie
ranch
the
better
to
seize
the
mansion
the
park
the
whole
of
walt
disney
world
oh
i
do
think
it
come
to
that
i
said
carefully
i
sure
we
can
find
a
use
for
them
all
at
the
mansion
more
the
merrier
kim
cocked
quizzical
but
let
it
go
i
bit
my
tongue
the
pain
brought
me
back
to
reality
and
i
started
planning
costume
production
training
rosters
bunking
god
if
only
suneep
would
finish
the
robots
what
do
you
mean
i
said
hotly
lil
folded
her
arms
and
glared
no
julius
it
wo
fly
the
group
is
already
upset
that
all
the
glory
is
going
to
the
new
people
never
let
us
bring
more
in
they
also
wo
stop
working
on
the
rehab
to
train
them
costume
them
feed
them
and
mother
them
they
losing
whuffie
every
day
that
the
mansion
shut
up
and
they
do
want
any
more
delays
dave
already
joined
up
with
debra
and
i
sure
he
not
the
last
one
dave
the
jerk
who
pissed
all
over
the
rehab
in
the
meeting
of
course
he
gone
over
lil
and
dan
stood
side
by
side
on
the
porch
of
the
house
where
i
lived
i
driven
out
that
night
to
convince
lil
to
sell
the
on
bringing
in
more
recruits
but
it
was
going
according
to
plan
they
would
even
let
me
in
the
house
so
what
do
i
tell
kim
tell
her
whatever
you
want
lil
said
you
brought
her
in
you
manage
her
take
some
goddamn
responsibility
for
once
in
your
life
it
was
going
to
get
any
better
dan
gave
me
an
apologetic
look
lil
glared
a
moment
longer
then
went
into
the
house
debra
doing
real
well
he
said
the
net
all
over
her
biggest
thing
ever
is
taking
off
in
nightclubs
dance
mixes
with
the
dj
backup
being
shoved
in
bursts
into
the
dancers
god
i
said
i
fucked
up
dan
i
fucked
it
all
up
he
did
say
anything
and
that
was
the
same
as
agreeing
driving
back
to
the
hotel
i
decided
i
needed
to
talk
to
kim
she
was
a
problem
i
did
need
and
maybe
a
problem
i
could
solve
i
pulled
a
screeching
and
drove
the
little
runabout
to
her
place
a
tiny
condo
in
a
crumbling
complex
that
had
once
been
a
gated
village
her
place
was
easy
to
spot
all
the
lights
were
burning
faint
conversation
audible
through
the
screen
door
i
jogged
up
the
steps
two
at
a
time
and
was
about
to
knock
when
a
familiar
voice
drifted
through
the
screen
debra
saying
oh
yes
oh
yes
terrific
idea
i
never
really
thought
about
using
streetmosphere
players
to
liven
up
the
queue
area
but
you
making
a
lot
of
sense
you
people
have
just
been
doing
the
work
over
at
the
mansion
find
me
more
like
you
and
i
take
them
for
the
hall
any
day
i
heard
kim
and
her
young
friends
chatting
excitedly
proudly
the
anger
and
fear
suffused
me
from
tip
to
toe
and
i
felt
suddenly
light
and
cool
and
ready
to
do
something
terrible
i
padded
silently
down
the
steps
and
got
into
my
runabout
some
people
never
learn
i
one
of
them
apparently
i
almost
chortled
over
the
foolproof
simplicity
of
my
plan
as
i
slipped
in
through
the
cast
entrance
using
the
id
card
i
scored
when
my
systems
went
offline
and
i
was
no
longer
able
to
squirt
my
authorization
at
the
door
i
changed
clothes
in
a
bathroom
on
main
street
switching
into
a
black
cowl
that
completely
obscured
my
features
then
slunk
through
the
shadows
along
the
storefronts
until
i
came
to
the
moat
around
cinderella
castle
keeping
low
i
stepped
over
the
fence
and
walked
down
the
embankment
then
slipped
into
the
water
and
sloshed
across
to
the
adventureland
side
slipping
along
to
the
liberty
square
gateway
i
flattened
myself
in
doorways
whenever
i
heard
maintenance
crews
passing
in
the
distance
until
i
reached
the
hall
of
presidents
and
in
a
twinkling
i
was
inside
the
theater
itself
humming
the
small
world
theme
i
produced
a
short
wrecking
bar
from
my
cowl
tabbed
pocket
and
set
to
work
the
primary
broadcast
units
were
hidden
behind
a
painted
scrim
over
the
stage
and
they
were
surprisingly
well
built
for
a
first
generation
tech
i
really
worked
up
a
sweat
smashing
them
but
i
kept
at
it
until
not
a
single
component
remained
recognizable
the
work
was
slow
and
loud
in
the
silent
park
but
it
lulled
me
into
a
sleepy
reverie
an
autohypnotic
timeless
time
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
grabbed
the
storage
units
and
slipped
them
into
the
cowl
locating
their
backup
units
was
a
little
trickier
but
years
of
hanging
out
at
the
hall
of
presidents
while
lil
tinkered
with
the
animatronics
helped
me
i
methodically
investigated
every
nook
cranny
and
storage
area
until
i
located
them
in
what
had
been
a
closet
by
now
i
had
the
rhythm
of
the
thing
and
i
made
short
work
of
them
i
did
one
more
pass
wrecking
anything
that
looked
like
it
might
be
a
prototype
for
the
next
generation
or
notes
that
would
help
them
reconstruct
the
units
i
smashed
i
had
no
illusions
about
debra
preparedness
she
have
something
offsite
that
she
could
get
up
and
running
in
a
few
days
i
was
doing
anything
permanent
i
was
just
buying
myself
a
day
or
two
i
made
my
way
clean
out
of
the
park
without
being
spotted
and
sloshed
my
way
into
my
runabout
shoes
leaking
water
from
the
moat
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
i
slept
like
a
baby
of
course
i
got
caught
i
do
really
have
the
temperament
for
machiavellian
shenanigans
and
i
left
a
trail
a
mile
wide
from
the
muddy
footprints
in
the
contemporary
lobby
to
the
wrecking
bar
thoughtlessly
left
behind
with
my
cowl
and
the
storage
units
from
the
hall
forgotten
on
the
back
seat
of
my
runabout
i
whistled
my
personal
jazzy
uptempo
version
of
grim
grinning
ghosts
as
i
made
my
way
from
costuming
through
the
utilidor
out
to
liberty
square
half
an
hour
before
the
park
opened
standing
in
front
of
me
were
lil
and
debra
debra
was
holding
my
cowl
and
wrecking
bar
lil
held
the
storage
units
i
had
put
on
my
transdermals
that
morning
and
so
the
emotion
i
felt
was
unmuffled
loud
and
yammering
i
ran
i
ran
past
them
along
the
road
to
adventureland
past
the
tiki
room
where
i
been
killed
past
the
adventureland
gate
where
i
waded
through
the
moat
down
main
street
i
ran
and
ran
elbowing
early
guests
trampling
flowers
knocking
over
an
apple
cart
across
from
the
penny
arcade
i
ran
until
i
reached
the
main
gate
and
turned
thinking
i
outrun
lil
and
debra
and
all
my
problems
i
thought
wrong
they
were
both
there
a
step
behind
me
puffing
and
red
debra
held
my
wrecking
bar
like
a
weapon
and
she
brandished
it
at
me
you
a
goddamn
idiot
you
know
that
she
said
i
think
if
we
been
alone
she
would
swung
it
at
me
ca
take
it
when
someone
else
plays
rough
huh
debra
i
sneered
lil
shook
her
head
disgustedly
she
right
you
are
an
idiot
the
meeting
in
adventureland
you
coming
why
i
asked
feeling
belligerent
you
going
to
honor
me
for
all
my
hard
work
we
going
to
talk
about
the
future
julius
what
left
of
it
for
us
for
god
sake
lil
ca
you
see
what
going
on
they
me
they
did
it
and
now
we
fighting
each
other
instead
of
her
why
you
see
how
that
is
you
better
watch
those
accusations
julius
debra
said
quietly
and
intensely
almost
hissing
i
do
know
who
killed
you
or
why
but
you
the
one
who
guilty
here
you
need
help
i
barked
a
humorless
laugh
guests
were
starting
to
stream
into
the
park
and
several
of
them
were
watching
intently
as
the
three
costumed
castmembers
shouted
at
each
other
i
could
feel
my
whuffie
hemorrhaging
debra
you
are
purely
full
of
shit
and
your
work
is
trite
and
unimaginative
you
a
fucking
despoiler
and
you
do
even
have
the
guts
to
admit
it
that
julius
lil
said
her
face
hard
her
rage
barely
in
check
we
going
debra
walked
a
pace
behind
me
lil
a
pace
before
all
the
way
through
the
crowd
to
adventureland
i
saw
a
dozen
opportunities
to
slip
into
a
gap
in
the
human
ebb
and
flow
and
escape
custody
but
i
did
try
i
wanted
a
chance
to
tell
the
whole
world
what
i
done
and
why
i
done
it
debra
followed
us
in
when
we
mounted
the
steps
to
the
meeting
room
lil
turned
i
do
think
you
should
be
here
debra
she
said
in
measured
tones
debra
shook
her
head
you
ca
keep
me
out
you
know
and
you
should
want
to
we
on
the
same
side
i
snorted
derisively
and
i
think
it
decided
lil
come
on
then
she
said
it
was
sro
in
the
meeting
room
packed
to
the
gills
with
the
entire
except
for
my
new
recruits
no
work
was
being
done
on
the
rehab
then
and
the
liberty
belle
would
be
sitting
at
her
dock
even
the
restaurant
crews
were
there
liberty
square
must
been
a
ghost
town
it
gave
the
meeting
a
sense
of
urgency
the
knowledge
that
there
were
guests
in
liberty
square
wandering
aimlessly
looking
for
castmembers
to
help
them
out
of
course
debra
crew
might
been
around
the
crowd
faces
were
hard
and
bitter
leaving
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
was
in
deep
shit
even
dan
sitting
in
the
front
row
looked
angry
i
nearly
started
crying
right
then
dan
oh
dan
my
pal
my
confidant
my
patsy
my
rival
my
nemesis
dan
dan
dan
i
wanted
to
beat
him
to
death
and
hug
him
at
the
same
time
lil
took
the
podium
and
tucked
stray
hairs
behind
her
ears
all
right
then
she
said
i
stood
to
her
left
and
debra
stood
to
her
right
thanks
for
coming
out
today
i
like
to
get
this
done
quickly
we
all
have
important
work
to
get
to
i
run
down
the
facts
last
night
a
member
of
this
vandalized
the
hall
of
presidents
rendering
it
useless
it
estimated
that
it
will
take
at
least
a
week
to
get
it
back
up
and
running
i
do
have
to
tell
you
that
this
is
acceptable
this
has
never
happened
before
and
it
will
never
happen
again
we
going
to
see
to
that
i
like
to
propose
that
no
further
work
be
done
on
the
mansion
until
the
hall
of
presidents
is
fully
operational
i
will
be
volunteering
my
services
on
the
repairs
there
were
nods
in
the
audience
lil
would
be
the
only
one
working
at
the
hall
that
week
disney
world
is
a
competition
lil
said
all
the
different
work
together
and
we
do
it
to
make
the
park
as
good
as
we
can
we
lose
sight
of
that
at
our
peril
i
nearly
gagged
on
bile
i
like
to
say
something
i
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
manage
lil
shot
me
a
look
that
fine
julius
any
member
of
the
can
speak
i
took
a
deep
breath
i
did
it
all
right
i
said
my
voice
cracked
i
did
it
and
i
do
have
any
excuse
for
having
done
it
it
may
not
have
been
the
smartest
thing
i
ever
done
but
i
think
you
all
should
understand
how
i
was
driven
to
it
we
not
to
be
in
competition
with
one
another
here
but
we
all
know
that
that
just
a
polite
fiction
the
truth
is
that
real
competition
in
the
park
and
that
the
hardest
players
are
the
crew
that
rehabbed
the
hall
of
presidents
they
the
hall
from
you
they
did
it
while
you
were
distracted
they
used
to
engineer
the
distraction
they
me
i
heard
the
shriek
creeping
into
my
voice
but
i
could
do
anything
about
it
usually
the
lie
that
we
all
on
the
same
side
is
fine
it
lets
us
work
together
in
peace
but
that
changed
the
day
they
had
me
shot
if
you
keep
on
believing
it
you
going
to
lose
the
mansion
the
liberty
belle
tom
sawyer
island
all
of
it
all
the
history
we
have
with
this
place
all
the
history
that
the
billions
who
visited
it
have
it
going
to
be
destroyed
and
replaced
with
the
sterile
thoughtless
shit
that
taken
over
the
hall
once
that
happens
there
nothing
left
that
makes
this
place
special
anyone
can
get
the
same
experience
sitting
at
home
on
the
sofa
what
happens
then
huh
how
much
longer
do
you
think
this
place
will
stay
open
once
the
only
people
here
are
debra
smiled
condescendingly
are
you
finished
then
she
asked
sweetly
fine
i
know
i
not
a
member
of
this
group
but
since
it
was
my
work
that
was
destroyed
last
night
i
think
i
would
like
to
address
julius
statements
if
you
do
mind
she
paused
but
no
one
spoke
up
first
of
all
i
want
you
all
to
know
that
we
do
hold
you
responsible
for
what
happened
last
night
we
know
who
was
responsible
and
he
needs
help
i
urge
you
to
see
to
it
that
he
gets
it
next
i
like
to
say
that
as
far
as
i
concerned
we
are
on
the
same
side
the
side
of
the
park
this
is
a
special
place
and
it
exist
without
all
of
our
contributions
what
happened
to
julius
was
terrible
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
person
responsible
is
caught
and
brought
to
justice
but
that
person
was
me
or
any
of
the
people
in
my
lil
i
like
to
thank
you
for
your
generous
offer
of
assistance
and
we
take
you
up
on
it

for
all
of
you

on
by
the
hall
we
put
you
to
work
we

up
and
running
in
no
time
now
as
far
as
the
mansion
goes
let
me
say
this
once
and
for
all
neither
me
nor
my
have
any
desire
to
take
over
the
operations
of
the
mansion
it
is
a
terrific
attraction
and
it
getting
better
with
the
work
you
all
doing
if
you
been
worrying
about
it
then
you
can
stop
worrying
now
we
all
on
the
same
side
thanks
for
hearing
me
out
i
got
to
go
see
my
team
now
she
turned
and
left
a
chorus
of
applause
following
her
out
lil
waited
until
it
died
down
then
said
all
right
then
we
got
work
to
do
too
i
like
to
ask
you
all
a
favor
first
i
like
us
to
keep
the
details
of
last
night
incident
to
ourselves
letting
the
guests
and
the
world
know
about
this
ugly
business
is
good
for
anyone
can
we
all
agree
to
do
that
there
was
a
moment
pause
while
the
results
were
tabulated
on
the
huds
then
lil
gave
them
a
smile
i
knew
you
come
through
thanks
guys
let
get
to
work
i
spent
the
day
at
the
hotel
listlessly
scrolling
around
on
my
terminal
lil
had
made
it
very
clear
to
me
after
the
meeting
that
i
was
to
show
my
face
inside
the
park
until
i
gotten
help
whatever
that
meant
by
noon
the
news
was
out
it
was
hard
to
pin
down
the
exact
source
but
it
seemed
to
revolve
around
the
new
recruits
one
of
them
had
told
their
about
the
high
drama
in
liberty
square
and
mentioned
my
name
there
were
already
a
couple
of
sites
vilifying
me
and
i
expected
more
i
needed
some
kind
of
help
that
was
for
sure
i
thought
about
leaving
then
turning
my
back
on
the
whole
business
and
leaving
walt
disney
world
to
start
yet
another
new
life
and
it
would
be
so
bad
i
been
in
poor
repute
before
not
so
long
ago
that
first
time
dan
and
i
had
palled
around
back
at
the
u
of
t
been
the
center
of
a
lot
of
pretty
ambivalent
sentiment
and
poor
as
a
man
can
be
i
slept
in
a
little
coffin
perfectly
climate
controlled
it
was
cramped
and
dull
but
my
access
to
the
network
was
free
and
i
had
plenty
of
material
to
entertain
myself
while
i
could
get
a
table
in
a
restaurant
i
was
free
to
queue
up
at
any
of
the
makers
around
town
and
get
myself
whatever
i
wanted
to
eat
and
drink
whenever
i
wanted
it
compared
to
percent
of
all
the
people
who
ever
lived
i
had
a
life
of
unparalleled
luxury
even
by
the
standards
of
the
bitchun
society
i
was
hardly
a
rarity
the
number
of
individuals
at
large
was
significant
and
they
got
along
just
fine
hanging
out
in
parks
arguing
reading
staging
plays
playing
music
of
course
that
was
the
life
for
me
i
had
dan
to
pal
around
with
a
rare
individual
who
was
willing
to
fraternize
with
a
shmuck
like
me
he
stand
me
to
meals
at
sidewalk
cafes
and
concerts
at
the
skydome
and
shoot
down
any
snotty
who
sneered
at
my
whuffie
tally
being
with
dan
was
a
process
of
constantly
reevaluating
my
beliefs
in
the
bitchun
society
and
i
never
had
a
more
vibrant
time
in
all
my
life
i
could
have
left
the
park
deadheaded
to
anywhere
in
the
world
started
over
i
could
have
turned
my
back
on
dan
on
debra
on
lil
and
the
whole
mess
i
did
i
called
up
the
doc
chapter
doctor
pete
answered
on
the
third
ring
in
the
background
i
heard
a
chorus
of
crying
children
the
constant
backdrop
of
the
magic
kingdom
infirmary
hi
doc
i
said
hello
julius
what
can
i
do
for
you
under
the
veneer
of
professional
medical
and
castmember
friendliness
i
sensed
irritation
it
all
good
i
not
really
sure
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
talk
it
over
with
you
i
having
some
pretty
big
problems
i
until
five
can
it
wait
until
then
by
then
i
had
no
idea
if
i
have
the
nerve
to
see
him
i
do
think
so
i
was
hoping
we
could
meet
right
away
if
it
an
emergency
i
can
have
an
ambulance
sent
for
you
it
urgent
but
not
an
emergency
i
need
to
talk
about
it
in
person
please
he
sighed
in
undoctorly
uncastmemberly
fashion
julius
i
got
important
things
to
do
here
are
you
sure
this
ca
wait
i
bit
back
a
sob
i
sure
doc
all
right
then
when
can
you
be
here
lil
had
made
it
clear
that
she
did
want
me
in
the
park
can
you
meet
me
i
ca
really
come
to
you
i
at
the
contemporary
tower
b
room
i
do
really
make
house
calls
son
i
know
i
know
i
hated
how
pathetic
i
sounded
can
you
make
an
exception
i
do
know
who
else
to
turn
to
i
be
there
as
soon
as
i
can
i
have
to
get
someone
to
cover
for
me
let
not
make
a
habit
of
this
all
right
i
whooshed
out
my
relief
i
promise
he
disconnected
abruptly
and
i
found
myself
dialing
dan
yes
he
said
cautiously
doctor
pete
is
coming
over
dan
i
do
know
if
he
can
help
me
i
do
know
if
anyone
can
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
he
surprised
me
then
and
made
me
remember
why
he
was
still
my
friend
even
after
everything
do
you
want
me
to
come
over
that
would
be
very
nice
i
said
quietly
i
at
the
hotel
give
me
ten
minutes
he
said
and
rang
off
he
found
me
on
my
patio
looking
out
at
the
castle
and
the
peaks
of
space
mountain
to
my
left
spread
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
seven
seas
lagoon
to
my
right
the
property
stretched
away
for
mile
after
manicured
mile
the
sun
was
warm
on
my
skin
faint
strains
of
happy
laughter
drifted
with
the
wind
and
the
flowers
were
in
bloom
in
toronto
it
would
be
freezing
rain
gray
buildings
noisome
rapid
transit
a
monorail
hissed
by
and
anonymity
i
missed
it
dan
pulled
up
a
chair
next
to
mine
and
sat
without
a
word
we
both
stared
out
at
the
view
for
a
long
while
it
something
else
is
it
i
said
finally
i
suppose
so
he
said
i
want
to
say
something
before
the
doc
comes
by
julius
go
ahead
lil
and
i
are
through
it
should
never
have
happened
in
the
first
place
and
i
not
proud
of
myself
if
you
two
were
breaking
up
none
of
my
business
but
i
had
no
right
to
hurry
it
along
all
right
i
said
i
was
too
drained
for
emotion
i
taken
a
room
here
moved
my
things
how
lil
taking
it
oh
she
thinks
i
a
total
bastard
i
suppose
she
right
i
suppose
she
partly
right
i
corrected
him
he
gave
me
a
gentle
slug
in
the
shoulder
thanks
we
waited
in
companionable
silence
until
the
doc
arrived
he
bustled
in
his
smile
lines
drawn
up
into
a
sour
purse
and
waited
expectantly
i
left
dan
on
the
patio
while
i
took
a
seat
on
the
bed
i
cracking
up
or
something
i
said
i
been
acting
erratically
sometimes
violently
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
me
i
rehearsed
the
speech
but
it
still
was
easy
to
choke
out
we
both
know
what
wrong
julius
the
doc
said
impatiently
you
need
to
be
refreshed
from
your
backup
get
set
up
with
a
fresh
clone
and
retire
this
one
we
had
this
talk
i
ca
do
it
i
said
not
meeting
his
eye
i
just
ca
there
another
way
the
doc
shook
his
head
julius
i
got
limited
resources
to
allocate
there
a
perfectly
good
cure
for
what
ailing
you
and
if
you
take
it
there
not
much
i
can
do
for
you
but
what
about
meds
your
problem
is
a
chemical
imbalance
it
a
mental
defect
your
is
son
all
that
meds
will
do
is
mask
the
symptoms
while
you
get
worse
i
ca
tell
you
what
you
want
to
hear
unfortunately
now
if
you
ready
to
take
the
cure
i
can
retire
this
clone
immediately
and
get
you
restored
into
a
new
one
in
hours
is
there
another
way
please
you
have
to
help
me
i
ca
lose
all
this
i
could
admit
my
real
reasons
for
being
so
attached
to
this
singularly
miserable
chapter
in
my
life
not
even
to
myself
the
doctor
rose
to
go
look
julius
you
have
got
the
whuffie
to
make
it
worth
anyone
time
to
research
a
solution
to
this
problem
other
than
the
one
that
we
all
know
about
i
can
give
you
suppressants
but
that
not
a
permanent
solution
why
not
he
boggled
you
just
take
dope
for
the
rest
of
your
life
son
eventually
something
will
happen
to
this
body
i
see
from
your
file
that
you
and
you
going
to
get
refreshed
from
your
backup
the
longer
you
wait
the
more
traumatic
it
be
you
robbing
from
your
future
self
for
your
selfish
present
it
was
the
first
time
the
thought
had
crossed
my
mind
every
passing
day
made
it
harder
to
take
the
cure
to
lie
down
and
wake
up
friends
with
dan
to
wake
up
and
be
in
love
with
lil
again
to
wake
up
to
a
mansion
the
way
i
remembered
it
a
hall
of
presidents
where
i
could
find
lil
bent
over
with
her
head
in
a
president
guts
of
an
afternoon
to
lie
down
and
wake
without
disgrace
without
knowing
that
my
lover
and
my
best
friend
would
betray
me
betrayed
me
i
just
could
do
it
not
yet
anyway
dan
dan
was
going
to
kill
himself
soon
and
if
i
restored
myself
from
my
old
backup
i
lose
my
last
year
with
him
i
lose
last
year
let
table
that
doc
i
hear
what
you
saying
but
complications
i
guess
i
take
the
for
now
he
gave
me
a
cold
look
i
give
you
a
scrip
then
i
could
done
that
without
coming
out
here
please
do
call
me
anymore
i
was
shocked
by
his
obvious
ire
but
i
did
understand
it
until
he
was
gone
and
i
told
dan
what
had
happened
us
we
used
to
thinking
of
doctors
as
highly
trained
professionals
all
that
stuff
long
internships
anatomy
drills
truth
is
the
average
doc
today
gets
more
training
in
bedside
manner
than
bioscience
pete
is
a
technician
not
an
md
not
the
way
you
and
i
mean
it
anyone
with
the
kind
of
knowledge
you
looking
for
is
working
as
a
historical
researcher
not
a
doctor
but
that
not
the
illusion
the
doc
is
supposed
to
be
the
authority
on
medical
matters
even
though
he
only
got
one
trick
restore
from
backup
you
reminding
pete
of
that
and
he
not
happy
to
have
it
happen
i
waited
a
week
before
returning
to
the
magic
kingdom
sunning
myself
on
the
white
sand
beach
at
the
contemporary
jogging
the
walk
around
the
world
taking
a
canoe
out
to
the
wild
and
overgrown
discovery
island
and
generally
cooling
out
dan
came
by
in
the
evenings
and
it
was
like
old
times
running
down
the
pros
and
cons
of
whuffie
and
bitchunry
and
life
in
general
sitting
on
my
porch
with
a
sweating
pitcher
of
lemonade
on
the
last
night
he
presented
me
with
a
clever
little
handheld
a
museum
piece
that
i
recalled
fondly
from
the
dawning
days
of
the
bitchun
society
it
had
much
of
the
functionality
of
my
defunct
systems
in
a
package
i
could
slip
in
my
shirt
pocket
it
felt
like
part
of
a
costume
like
the
turnip
watches
the
ben
franklin
streetmosphere
players
wore
at
the
american
adventure
museum
piece
or
no
it
meant
that
i
was
once
again
qualified
to
participate
in
the
bitchun
society
albeit
more
slowly
and
less
efficiently
than
i
once
may
i
took
it
downstairs
the
next
morning
and
drove
to
the
magic
kingdom
castmember
lot
at
least
that
was
the
plan
when
i
got
down
to
the
parking
lot
my
runabout
was
gone
a
quick
check
with
the
handheld
revealed
the
worst
my
whuffie
was
low
enough
that
someone
had
just
gotten
inside
and
driven
away
realizing
that
they
could
make
more
popular
use
of
it
than
i
could
with
a
sinking
feeling
i
trudged
up
to
my
room
and
swiped
my
key
through
the
lock
it
emitted
a
soft
unsatisfied
and
lit
up
please
see
the
front
desk
my
room
had
been
reassigned
too
i
had
the
short
end
of
the
whuffie
stick
at
least
there
was
no
mandatory
whuffie
check
on
the
monorail
platform
but
the
other
people
on
the
car
were
none
too
friendly
to
me
and
no
one
offered
me
an
inch
more
personal
space
than
was
necessary
i
had
hit
bottom
i
took
the
castmember
entrance
to
the
magic
kingdom
clipping
my
name
tag
to
my
disney
operations
polo
shirt
ignoring
the
glares
of
my
fellow
castmembers
in
the
utilidors
i
used
the
handheld
to
page
dan
hey
there
he
said
brightly
i
could
tell
instantly
that
i
was
being
humored
where
are
you
i
asked
oh
up
in
the
square
by
the
liberty
tree
in
front
of
the
hall
of
presidents
i
worked
the
handheld
pinged
some
whuffie
manually
debra
was
spiked
so
high
it
seemed
she
never
come
down
as
were
tim
and
her
whole
crew
in
aggregate
they
were
drawing
from
guests
by
the
millions
and
from
castmembers
and
from
people
read
the
popular
accounts
of
their
struggle
against
the
forces
of
petty
jealousy
and
sabotage
me
i
felt
i
hurried
along
to
costuming
and
changed
into
the
heavy
green
mansion
costume
then
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
square
i
found
dan
sipping
a
coffee
and
sitting
on
a
bench
under
the
giant
liberty
tree
he
had
a
second
cup
waiting
for
me
and
patted
the
bench
next
to
him
i
sat
with
him
and
sipped
waiting
for
him
to
spill
whatever
bit
of
rotten
news
he
had
for
me
this
morning
i
could
feel
it
hovering
like
storm
clouds
he
would
talk
though
not
until
we
finished
the
coffee
then
he
stood
and
strolled
over
to
the
mansion
it
was
yet
and
there
were
any
guests
in
the
park
which
was
all
for
the
better
given
what
was
coming
next
have
you
taken
a
look
at
debra
whuffie
lately
he
asked
finally
as
we
stood
by
the
pet
cemetery
considering
the
empty
scaffolding
i
started
to
pull
out
the
handheld
but
he
put
a
hand
on
my
arm
bother
he
said
morosely
suffice
it
to
say
debra
gang
is
number
one
with
a
bullet
ever
since
word
got
out
about
what
happened
to
the
hall
they
been
stacking
it
deep
they
can
do
just
about
anything
jules
and
get
away
with
it
my
stomach
tightened
and
i
found
myself
grinding
my
molars
so
what
is
it
they
done
dan
i
asked
already
knowing
the
answer
dan
did
have
to
respond
because
at
that
moment
tim
emerged
from
the
mansion
wearing
a
light
cotton
he
had
a
thoughtful
expression
and
when
he
saw
us
he
beamed
his
elfin
grin
and
came
over
hey
guys
he
said
hi
tim
dan
said
i
nodded
not
trusting
myself
to
speak
pretty
exciting
stuff
huh
he
said
i
have
told
him
yet
dan
said
with
forced
lightness
why
you
run
it
down
well
it
pretty
radical
i
have
to
admit
we
learned
some
stuff
from
the
hall
that
we
wanted
to
apply
and
at
the
same
time
we
wanted
to
capture
some
of
the
historical
character
of
the
ghost
story
i
opened
my
mouth
to
object
but
dan
put
a
hand
on
my
forearm
really
he
asked
innocently
how
do
you
plan
on
doing
that
well
we
keeping
the
telepresence
robots
that
a
honey
of
an
idea
julius
but
we
giving
each
one
an
uplink
so
that
it
can
we
got
some
horror
writers
pulling
together
a
series
of
narratives
about
the
lives
of
each
ghost
how
they
met
their
tragic
ends
what
they
done
since
you
know
the
way
we
storyboarded
it
the
guests
stream
through
the
ride
pretty
much
the
way
they
do
now
walking
through
the
preshow
and
then
getting
into
the
the
doom
buggies
but
here
the
big
change
we
it
all
we
trade
off
throughput
for
intensity
make
it
more
of
a
premium
product
so
you
a
guest
from
the
queue
to
the
unload
zone
you
being
chased
by
these
ghosts
these
telepresence
robots
and
they
really
scary
i
got
suneep
concept
artists
going
back
to
the
drawing
board
hitting
basic
research
on
stuff
that
just
scare
the
guests
silly
when
a
ghost
catches
you
lays
its
hands
on
you
wham
bake
you
get
its
whole
grisly
story
in
three
seconds
across
your
frontal
lobe
by
the
time
you
left
you
had
ten
or
more
contacts
and
the
next
time
you
come
back
it
all
new
ghosts
with
all
new
stories
the
way
that
the
hall
drawing
we
bound
to
be
a
hit
he
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
rocked
on
his
heels
clearly
proud
of
himself
when
epcot
center
first
opened
long
long
ago
there
been
an
ugly
decade
or
so
in
ride
design
imagineering
found
a
winning
formula
for
spaceship
earth
the
flagship
ride
in
the
big
golf
ball
and
in
their
drive
to
establish
thematic
continuity
they
turned
the
formula
into
a
stamping
out
half
a
dozen
clones
for
each
of
the
themed
areas
in
the
future
showcase
it
went
like
this
first
we
were
cavemen
then
there
was
ancient
greece
then
rome
burned
cue
fx
then
there
was
the
great
depression
and
finally
we
reached
the
modern
age
who
knows
what
the
future
holds
we
do
we
all
have
videophones
and
be
living
on
the
ocean
floor
once
was
cute
compelling
and
inspirational
even
but
six
times
was
embarrassing
like
everyone
once
imagineering
got
themselves
a
good
hammer
everything
started
to
resemble
a
nail
even
now
the
epcot
were
repeating
the
sins
of
their
forebears
closing
every
ride
with
a
scene
of
bitchun
utopia
and
debra
was
repeating
the
classic
mistake
tearing
her
way
through
the
magic
kingdom
with
her
blaster
set
to
tim
i
said
hearing
the
tremble
in
my
voice
i
thought
you
said
that
you
had
no
designs
on
the
mansion
that
you
and
debra
would
be
trying
to
take
it
away
from
us
did
you
say
that
tim
rocked
back
as
if
i
slapped
him
and
the
blood
drained
from
his
face
but
we
not
taking
it
away
he
said
you
us
to
help
i
shook
my
head
confused
we
did
i
said
sure
he
said
yes
dan
said
kim
and
some
of
the
other
rehab
cast
went
to
debra
yesterday
and
asked
her
to
do
a
design
review
of
the
current
rehab
and
suggest
any
changes
she
was
good
enough
to
agree
and
they
come
up
with
some
great
ideas
i
read
between
the
lines
the
newbies
you
invited
in
have
gone
over
to
the
other
side
and
we
going
to
lose
everything
because
of
them
i
felt
like
shit
well
i
stand
corrected
i
said
carefully
tim
grin
came
back
and
he
clapped
his
hands
together
really
loves
the
i
thought
could
have
been
on
our
side
if
we
had
only
played
it
all
dan
and
i
took
to
the
utilidors
and
grabbed
a
pair
of
bicycles
and
sped
towards
suneep
lab
jangling
our
bells
at
the
rushing
castmembers
they
do
have
the
authority
to
invite
debra
in
i
panted
as
we
pedaled
says
who
dan
said
it
was
part
of
the
deal
they
knew
that
they
were
probationary
members
right
from
the
start
they
were
even
allowed
into
the
design
meetings
looks
like
they
took
themselves
off
probation
he
said
suneep
gave
us
both
a
chilly
look
when
we
entered
his
lab
he
had
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
and
his
hands
shook
with
exhaustion
he
seemed
to
be
holding
himself
erect
with
nothing
more
than
raw
anger
so
much
for
building
without
interference
he
said
we
agreed
that
this
project
would
change
midway
through
now
it
has
and
i
got
other
commitments
that
i
going
to
have
to
cancel
because
this
is
going
i
made
soothing
apologetic
gestures
with
my
hands
suneep
believe
me
i
just
as
upset
about
this
as
you
are
we
do
like
this
one
little
bit
he
harrumphed
we
had
a
deal
julius
he
said
hotly
i
would
do
the
rehab
for
you
and
you
would
keep
the
off
my
back
i
been
holding
up
my
end
of
the
bargain
but
where
the
hell
have
you
been
if
they
replan
the
rehab
now
i
to
go
along
with
them
i
just
leave
the
mansion
they
murder
me
the
kernel
of
a
plan
formed
in
my
mind
suneep
we
do
like
the
new
rehab
plan
and
we
going
to
stop
it
you
can
help
just
stonewall
them
tell
them
they
have
to
find
other
imagineering
support
if
they
want
to
go
through
with
it
that
you
booked
solid
dan
gave
me
one
of
his
long
considering
looks
then
nodded
a
minute
approval
yeah
he
drawled
that
help
all
right
just
tell
that
they
welcome
to
make
any
changes
they
want
to
the
plan
they
can
find
someone
else
to
execute
them
suneep
looked
unhappy
fine
so
then
they
go
and
find
someone
else
to
do
it
and
that
person
gets
all
the
credit
for
the
work
my
team
done
so
far
i
just
flush
my
time
down
the
toilet
it
wo
come
to
that
i
said
quickly
if
you
can
just
keep
saying
no
for
a
couple
days
we
do
the
rest
suneep
looked
doubtful
i
promise
i
said
suneep
ran
his
stubby
fingers
through
his
already
crazed
hair
all
right
he
said
morosely
dan
slapped
him
on
the
back
good
man
he
said
it
should
have
worked
it
almost
did
i
sat
in
the
back
of
the
adventureland
conference
room
while
dan
exhorted
look
you
do
have
to
roll
over
for
debra
and
her
people
this
is
garden
and
you
tended
it
responsibly
for
years
she
got
no
right
to
move
in
on
you
you
got
all
the
whuffie
you
need
to
defend
the
place
if
you
all
work
together
no
castmember
likes
confrontation
and
the
liberty
square
bunch
were
tough
to
rouse
to
action
dan
had
turned
down
the
air
conditioning
an
hour
before
the
meeting
and
closed
up
all
the
windows
so
that
the
room
was
a
kiln
for
irritation
into
rage
i
stood
meekly
in
the
back
as
far
as
possible
from
dan
he
was
working
his
magic
on
my
behalf
and
i
was
content
to
let
him
do
his
thing
when
lil
had
arrived
she
sized
up
the
situation
with
a
sour
expression
sit
in
the
front
near
dan
or
in
the
back
near
me
chosen
the
middle
and
to
concentrate
on
dan
i
had
to
tear
my
eyes
away
from
the
sweat
glistening
on
her
long
pale
neck
dan
stalked
the
aisles
like
a
preacher
eyes
blazing
your
future
they
your
they
claim
they
got
your
support
he
lowered
his
tone
i
do
think
that
true
he
grabbed
a
castmember
by
her
hand
and
looked
into
her
eyes
is
it
true
he
said
so
low
it
was
almost
a
whisper
no
the
castmember
said
he
dropped
her
hand
and
whirled
to
face
another
castmember
is
it
true
he
demanded
raising
his
voice
slightly
no
the
castmember
said
his
voice
unnaturally
loud
after
the
whispers
a
nervous
chuckle
rippled
through
the
crowd
is
it
true
he
said
striding
to
the
podium
shouting
now
no
the
crowd
roared
no
he
shouted
back
you
do
roll
over
and
take
it
you
can
fight
back
carry
on
with
the
plan
send
them
packing
they
only
taking
over
because
you
letting
them
are
you
going
to
let
them
no
bitchun
wars
are
rare
long
before
anyone
tries
a
takeover
of
anything
they
done
the
arithmetic
and
ensured
themselves
that
the
they
displacing
does
have
a
hope
of
fighting
back
for
the
defenders
it
a
simple
decision
step
down
gracefully
and
salvage
some
reputation
out
of
the
thing
fighting
back
will
surely
burn
away
even
that
meager
reward
no
one
benefits
from
fighting
back
least
of
all
the
thing
fighting
over
for
example
it
was
the
second
year
of
my
undergrad
taking
a
in
not
making
trouble
for
my
profs
and
keeping
my
mouth
shut
it
was
the
early
days
of
bitchun
and
most
of
us
were
still
a
little
unclear
on
the
concept
not
all
of
us
though
a
group
of
campus
grad
students
in
the
sociology
department
were
on
the
bleeding
edge
of
the
revolution
and
they
knew
what
they
wanted
control
of
the
department
oustering
of
the
tyrannical
stodgy
profs
a
bully
pulpit
from
which
to
preach
the
bitchun
gospel
to
a
generation
of
impressionable
undergrads
who
were
too
cowed
by
their
workloads
to
realize
what
a
load
of
shit
they
were
being
fed
by
the
university
at
least
that
what
the
intense
heavyset
woman
who
seized
the
mic
at
my
soc
course
said
that
sleepy
morning
at
convocation
hall
nineteen
hundred
students
filled
the
hall
a
capacity
crowd
of
bleary
and
they
woke
up
in
a
hurry
when
the
woman
strident
harangue
burst
over
their
heads
i
saw
it
happen
from
the
very
start
the
prof
was
down
there
on
the
stage
a
speck
with
a
droning
over
his
slides
and
then
there
was
a
blur
as
half
a
dozen
grad
students
rushed
the
stage
they
were
dressed
in
university
wrinkled
slacks
and
tattered
sports
coats
and
five
of
them
formed
a
human
wall
in
front
of
the
prof
while
the
sixth
the
heavyset
one
with
the
dark
hair
and
the
prominent
mole
on
her
cheek
unclipped
his
mic
and
clipped
it
to
her
lapel
wakey
wakey
she
called
and
the
reality
of
the
moment
hit
home
for
me
this
was
on
the
come
on
heads
up
this
is
a
drill
the
university
of
toronto
department
of
sociology
is
under
new
management
if
you
set
your
handhelds
to
we
be
beaming
out
new
momentarily
if
you
forgotten
your
handhelds
you
can
download
the
plans
later
on
i
going
to
run
it
down
for
you
right
now
anyway
before
i
start
though
i
have
a
prepared
statement
for
you
probably
hear
this
a
couple
times
more
today
in
your
other
classes
it
worth
repeating
here
goes
we
reject
the
stodgy
tyrannical
rule
of
the
profs
at
this
department
we
demand
bully
pulpits
from
which
to
preach
the
bitchun
gospel
effective
immediately
the
university
of
toronto
sociology
department
is
we
promise
curriculum
with
an
emphasis
on
reputation
economies
social
dynamics
and
the
social
theory
of
infinite
no
more
durkheim
kids
just
deadheading
this
will
be
she
taught
the
course
like
a
pro
you
could
tell
she
been
drilling
her
lecture
for
a
while
periodically
the
human
wall
behind
her
shuddered
as
the
prof
made
a
break
for
it
and
was
restrained
at
precisely
she
dismissed
the
class
which
had
hung
on
her
every
word
instead
of
trudging
out
and
ambling
to
our
next
class
the
whole
nineteen
hundred
of
us
rose
and
as
one
started
buzzing
to
our
neighbors
a
roar
of
can
you
believe
it
that
followed
us
out
the
door
and
to
our
next
encounter
with
the
sociology
department
it
was
cool
that
day
i
had
another
soc
class
constructing
social
deviance
and
we
got
the
same
drill
there
the
same
stirring
propaganda
the
same
comical
sight
of
a
tenured
prof
battering
himself
against
a
human
wall
of
reporters
pounced
on
us
when
we
left
the
class
jabbing
at
us
with
mics
and
peppering
us
with
questions
i
gave
them
a
big
and
said
bitchun
in
classic
undergrad
eloquence
the
profs
struck
back
the
next
morning
i
got
a
from
the
newscast
as
i
brushed
my
teeth
the
dean
of
the
department
of
sociology
told
a
reporter
that
the
courses
would
not
be
credited
that
they
were
a
gang
of
thugs
who
were
totally
unqualified
to
teach
a
counterpoint
interview
from
a
spokesperson
for
the
established
that
all
of
the
new
lecturers
had
been
writing
and
lecture
notes
for
the
profs
they
replaced
for
years
and
that
they
also
written
most
of
their
journal
articles
the
profs
brought
university
security
out
to
help
them
regain
their
lecterns
only
to
be
repelled
by
security
guards
in
homemade
uniforms
university
security
got
the
message
anyone
could
be
replaced
and
stayed
away
the
profs
picketed
they
held
classes
out
front
attended
by
conscious
who
worried
that
the
classes
count
towards
their
degrees
fools
like
me
alternated
between
the
outdoor
and
indoor
classes
not
learning
much
of
anything
no
one
did
the
profs
spent
their
whoring
for
whuffie
leading
the
seminars
like
encounter
groups
instead
of
lectures
the
spent
their
time
badmouthing
the
profs
and
tearing
apart
their
coursework
at
the
end
of
the
semester
everyone
got
a
credit
and
the
university
senate
disbanded
the
sociology
program
in
favor
of
a
offering
from
concordia
in
montreal
forty
years
later
the
fight
was
settled
forever
once
you
took
the
rest
of
the
bitchunry
just
followed
a
settling
over
you
those
who
did
take
may
have
objected
but
hey
they
all
died
the
liberty
square
marched
shoulder
to
shoulder
through
the
utilidors
and
as
a
mass
took
back
the
haunted
mansion
dan
lil
and
i
were
up
front
careful
not
to
brush
against
one
another
as
we
walked
quickly
through
the
backstage
door
and
started
a
passing
out
the
materials
that
debra
people
had
stashed
there
along
a
line
that
snaked
back
to
the
front
porch
of
the
hall
of
presidents
where
they
were
unceremoniously
dumped
once
the
main
stash
was
vacated
we
split
up
and
roamed
the
ride
its
service
corridors
and
dioramas
the
and
the
secret
passages
rounding
up
every
scrap
of
debra
crap
and
passing
it
out
the
door
in
the
attic
scene
i
ran
into
kim
and
three
of
her
giggly
little
friends
their
eyes
glinting
in
the
dim
light
the
gaggle
of
transhuman
kids
made
my
guts
clench
made
me
think
of
zed
and
of
lil
and
of
my
unmediated
brain
and
i
had
a
sudden
urge
to
shred
them
verbally
no
no
that
way
lay
madness
and
war
this
was
about
taking
back
what
was
ours
not
punishing
the
interlopers
kim
i
think
you
should
leave
i
said
quietly
she
snorted
and
gave
me
a
dire
look
who
died
and
made
you
boss
she
said
her
friends
thought
it
very
brave
they
made
it
clear
with
jointed
and
glares
kim
you
can
leave
now
or
you
can
leave
later
the
longer
you
wait
the
worse
it
will
be
for
you
and
your
whuffie
you
blew
it
and
you
not
a
part
of
the
mansion
anymore
go
home
go
to
debra
do
stay
here
and
do
come
back
ever
ever
be
cast
out
of
this
thing
that
you
love
that
you
obsess
over
that
you
worked
for
now
i
said
quiet
dangerous
barely
in
control
they
sauntered
into
the
graveyard
hissing
vitriol
at
me
oh
they
had
lots
of
new
material
to
post
to
the
sites
messages
that
would
get
them
whuffie
with
people
who
thought
i
was
the
scum
of
the
earth
a
popular
view
those
days
i
got
out
of
the
mansion
and
looked
at
the
followed
it
to
the
front
of
the
hall
the
park
had
been
open
for
an
hour
and
a
herd
of
guests
watched
the
proceedings
in
confusion
the
liberty
square
passed
their
loads
around
in
clear
embarrassment
knowing
that
they
were
violating
every
principle
they
cared
about
as
i
watched
gaps
appeared
in
the
as
castmembers
slipped
away
faces
burning
scarlet
with
shame
at
the
hall
of
presidents
debra
presided
over
an
orderly
relocation
of
her
things
a
cheerful
cadre
of
her
castmembers
quickly
moving
it
all
offstage
i
did
have
to
look
at
my
handheld
to
know
what
was
happening
to
our
whuffie
by
evening
we
were
back
on
schedule
suneep
supervised
the
placement
of
his
telepresence
rigs
and
lil
went
over
every
system
in
minute
detail
bossing
a
crew
of
that
trailed
behind
her
and
checking
it
all
suneep
smiled
at
me
when
he
caught
sight
of
me
dust
in
the
parlor
congratulations
sir
he
said
and
shook
my
hand
it
was
masterfully
done
thanks
suneep
i
not
sure
how
masterful
it
was
but
we
got
the
job
done
and
that
what
counts
your
partners
they
happier
than
i
seen
them
since
this
whole
business
started
i
know
how
they
feel
my
partners
oh
yes
dan
and
lil
how
happy
were
they
i
wondered
happy
enough
to
get
back
together
my
mood
fell
even
though
a
part
of
me
said
that
dan
would
never
go
back
to
her
not
after
all
we
been
through
together
i
glad
you
glad
we
could
have
done
it
without
you
and
it
looks
like
we
be
open
for
business
in
a
week
oh
i
should
think
so
are
you
coming
to
the
party
tonight
party
probably
something
the
liberty
square
were
putting
on
i
would
almost
certainly
be
persona
non
grata
i
do
think
so
i
said
carefully
i
probably
work
late
here
he
chided
me
for
working
too
hard
but
once
he
saw
that
i
had
no
intention
of
being
dragged
to
the
party
he
left
off
and
that
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
mansion
at
the
next
morning
dozing
in
a
backstage
break
room
when
i
heard
a
commotion
from
the
parlor
festive
voices
happy
and
loud
and
i
assumed
it
was
liberty
square
coming
back
from
their
party
i
roused
myself
and
entered
the
parlor
kim
and
her
friends
were
there
pushing
of
debra
gear
i
got
ready
to
shout
something
horrible
at
them
and
that
when
debra
came
in
i
moderated
the
shout
to
a
snap
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
stopped
behind
debra
were
lil
parents
frozen
these
long
years
in
their
canopic
jars
in
kissimmee
chapter
lil
parents
went
into
their
jars
with
little
ceremony
i
saw
them
just
before
they
went
in
when
they
stopped
in
at
lil
and
my
place
to
kiss
her
goodbye
and
wish
her
well
tom
and
i
stood
awkwardly
to
the
side
while
lil
and
her
mother
held
an
achingly
chipper
and
polite
farewell
so
i
said
to
tom
deadheading
he
cocked
an
eyebrow
yup
took
the
backup
this
morning
before
coming
to
see
their
daughter
they
taken
their
backups
when
they
woke
this
event
everything
following
the
backup
would
never
have
happened
for
them
god
they
were
bastards
when
are
you
coming
back
i
asked
keeping
my
castmember
face
on
carefully
hiding
away
the
disgust
we
be
sampling
monthly
just
getting
a
digest
dumped
to
us
when
things
look
interesting
enough
we
come
on
back
he
waggled
a
finger
at
me
i
be
keeping
an
eye
on
you
and
lillian
you
treat
her
right
you
hear
we
sure
going
to
miss
you
two
around
here
i
said
he
pishtoshed
and
said
you
wo
even
notice
we
gone
this
is
your
world
now
we
just
getting
out
of
the
way
for
a
while
letting
take
a
run
at
it
we
would
be
going
down
if
we
did
have
faith
in
you
two
lil
and
her
mom
kissed
one
last
time
her
mother
was
more
affectionate
than
i
ever
seen
her
even
to
the
point
of
tearing
up
a
little
here
in
this
moment
of
vanishing
consciousness
she
could
be
whomever
she
wanted
knowing
that
it
would
matter
the
next
time
she
awoke
julius
she
said
taking
my
hands
squeezing
them
you
got
some
wonderful
times
ahead
of
you
between
lil
and
the
park
you
going
to
have
a
tremendous
experience
i
just
know
it
she
was
infinitely
serene
and
compassionate
and
i
knew
it
did
count
still
smiling
they
got
into
their
runabout
and
drove
away
to
get
the
lethal
injections
to
become
disembodied
consciousnesses
to
lose
their
last
moments
with
their
darling
daughter
they
were
not
happy
to
be
returned
from
the
dead
their
new
bodies
were
impossibly
young
pubescent
and
hormonal
and
doleful
and
kitted
out
in
the
latest
trendy
styles
in
the
company
of
kim
and
her
pals
they
made
a
solid
mass
of
irate
adolescence
just
what
the
hell
do
you
think
you
doing
rita
asked
shoving
me
hard
in
the
chest
i
stumbled
back
into
my
carefully
scattered
dust
raising
a
cloud
rita
came
after
me
but
tom
held
her
back
julius
go
away
your
actions
are
totally
indefensible
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
go
away
i
held
up
a
hand
tried
to
wave
away
his
words
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
do
say
a
word
he
said
leave
now
stay
here
and
do
come
back
kim
said
an
evil
look
on
her
face
no
i
said
no
goddamn
it
no
you
going
to
hear
me
out
and
then
i
going
to
get
lil
and
her
people
and
they
going
to
back
me
up
that
not
negotiable
we
stared
at
each
other
across
the
dim
parlor
debra
made
a
twiddling
motion
and
the
lights
came
up
full
and
harsh
the
expertly
crafted
gloom
went
away
and
it
was
just
a
dusty
room
with
a
fake
fireplace
let
him
speak
debra
said
rita
folded
her
arms
and
glared
i
did
some
really
awful
things
i
said
keeping
my
head
up
keeping
my
eyes
on
them
i
ca
excuse
them
and
i
do
ask
you
to
forgive
them
but
that
does
change
the
fact
that
we
put
our
hearts
and
souls
into
this
place
and
it
not
right
to
take
it
from
us
ca
we
have
one
constant
corner
of
the
world
one
bit
frozen
in
time
for
the
people
who
love
it
that
way
why
does
your
success
mean
our
failure
ca
you
see
that
we
carrying
on
your
work
that
we
tending
a
legacy
you
left
us
are
you
through
rita
asked
i
nodded
this
place
is
not
a
historical
preserve
julius
it
a
ride
if
you
do
understand
that
you
in
the
wrong
place
it
not
my
goddamn
fault
that
you
decided
that
your
stupidity
was
on
my
behalf
and
it
does
make
it
any
less
stupid
all
you
done
is
confirm
my
worst
fears
debra
mask
of
impartiality
slipped
you
stupid
deluded
asshole
she
said
softly
you
totter
around
pissing
and
moaning
about
your
little
murder
your
little
health
problems
yes
i
heard
your
little
fixation
on
keeping
things
the
way
they
are
you
need
some
perspective
julius
you
need
to
get
away
from
here
disney
world
is
good
for
you
and
you
sure
as
hell
not
any
good
for
disney
world
it
would
have
hurt
less
if
i
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
myself
somewhere
along
the
way
i
found
the
at
a
fort
wilderness
campsite
sitting
around
a
fire
and
singing
necking
laughing
the
victory
party
i
trudged
into
the
circle
and
hunted
for
lil
she
was
sitting
on
a
log
staring
into
the
fire
a
million
miles
away
lord
she
was
beautiful
when
she
fretted
i
stood
in
front
of
her
for
a
minute
and
she
stared
right
through
me
until
i
tapped
her
shoulder
she
gave
an
involuntary
squeak
and
then
smiled
at
herself
lil
i
said
then
stopped
parents
are
home
and
they
joined
the
other
for
the
first
time
in
an
age
she
looked
at
me
softly
smiled
even
she
patted
the
log
next
to
her
i
sat
down
felt
the
heat
of
the
fire
on
my
face
her
body
heat
on
my
side
god
how
did
i
screw
this
up
without
warning
she
put
her
arms
around
me
and
hugged
me
hard
i
hugged
her
back
nose
in
her
hair
woodsmoke
smell
and
shampoo
and
sweat
we
did
it
she
whispered
fiercely
i
held
onto
her
we
lil
i
said
again
and
pulled
away
what
she
said
her
eyes
shining
she
was
stoned
i
saw
that
now
your
parents
are
back
they
came
to
the
mansion
she
was
confused
shrinking
and
i
pressed
on
they
were
with
debra
she
reeled
back
as
if
i
slapped
her
i
told
them
i
bring
the
whole
group
back
to
talk
it
over
she
hung
her
head
and
her
shoulders
shook
and
i
tentatively
put
an
arm
around
her
she
shook
it
off
and
sat
up
she
was
crying
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
i
have
a
ferry
sent
over
she
said
i
sat
in
the
back
of
the
ferry
with
dan
away
from
the
confused
and
angry
i
answered
his
questions
with
terse
answers
and
he
gave
up
we
rode
in
silence
the
trees
on
the
edges
of
the
seven
seas
lagoon
whipping
back
and
forth
in
an
approaching
storm
the
shortcutted
through
the
west
parking
lot
and
moved
through
the
quiet
streets
of
frontierland
apprehensively
a
funeral
procession
that
stopped
the
nighttime
custodial
staff
in
their
tracks
as
we
drew
up
on
liberty
square
i
saw
that
the
were
blazing
and
a
tremendous
of
debra
were
moving
from
the
hall
to
the
mansion
undoing
our
teardown
of
their
work
working
alongside
of
them
were
tom
and
rita
lil
parents
sleeves
rolled
up
forearms
bulging
with
new
toned
muscle
the
group
stopped
in
its
tracks
and
lil
went
to
them
stumbling
on
the
wooden
sidewalk
i
expected
hugs
there
were
none
in
their
stead
parents
and
daughter
stalked
each
other
shifting
weight
and
posture
to
track
each
other
maintain
a
constant
sizing
distance
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
lil
said
finally
she
did
address
her
mother
which
surprised
me
it
did
surprise
tom
though
he
dipped
forward
the
shuffle
of
his
feet
loud
in
the
quiet
night
we
working
he
said
no
you
not
lil
said
you
destroying
stop
it
lil
mother
darted
to
her
husband
side
not

anything
just
standing

wordlessly
tom
hefted
the
box
he
was
holding
and
headed
to
the
mansion
lil
caught
his
arm
and
jerked
it
so
he
dropped
his
load

choked
sob

her
in
her
arms

i
felt
like
a
voyeur
but

bring
myself
to

her
mother
said
a
sibilant
sound
that
matched
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
on
the
liberty
tree

to
be
on
the
same
side

again
and
picked
up
her
father

it
to
the
mansion
one
at
a
time
the
rest
of

forward
and
joined
them
this

scared
i
trembled
when
i
ascended
the
stairs
to
dan
room
when
i
knocked
at
his
door
louder
and
harder
than
i
meant
a
panicked
banging
dan
answered
the
door
and
i
saw
his
eyes
go
to
his
hud
back
to
me
jesus
he
said
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
bed

bottom
in
walt
disney
world
in
a
hotel
with
the
hissing
of
the
monorail
and
the
sun
streaming
through
the
window
the
hooting
of
the
steam
engines
on
the
railroad
and
the
distant
howl
of
the
recorded
wolves
at
the
haunted
mansion
the
world
drops
away
from
you
recedes
until
you
nothing
but
a
speck
a
mote
in
blackness
i
was
hyperventilating
deliberately
i
slowed
my
breath
put
my
head
between
my
knees
until
the
dizziness
passed
take
me
to
lil
i
said
driving
together
hammering
cigarette
after
cigarette
into
my
face
i
remembered
the
night
dan

come
to
disney
world
when
i
driven
him
to
my
house
and
how
happy
i
been
then

secure
i
looked
at
dan
and
he
patted
my
hand
strange
times
he
said
it
was
enough
we
found
lil
in
an
underground
lightly
dozing
on
a
ratty
sofa
her
head
rested
on
tom
lap
her
feet
on
rita
all

snored
softly
they
had
a
long
night
dan
shook
lil
awake
she
stretched
out
and
opened
her
eyes
looked
sleepily
at
me
the
blood
drained
from
her
face

said
coldly

and
rita

that

back
we
could
let
it
go
on
the
way
it
was
we
owed
it
to
debra
and
lillian
tom
said
and
lillian
rita
said
absently
dan
pulled
up
a
chair
of
his

you
not

fair
to
him
he
said
at
least
someone

on
my
side

we
can
do
for
him
you
could
be
his
friend
dan
said
the
was
back
and
i
slumped
in
my
chair
tried
to
control
my
breathing
the
panicked
thumping
of
my
heart
you
could
try
to
understand
you
could
try
to
help
him
you
could
stick
with
him
the
way
he
stuck
with
you
you
do
have
to
toss
him
out
on
his
ass
lil
had
the
good
grace
to
look
slightly
shamed
i
get
him
a
room
she
said
for
a
month
in
kissimmee
a
motel
i
pick
up
his
network
access

that
fair
it
more
than

rita
said
why

she
hate
me
so
much
i
been
there
for
her
daughter
while
she
was
away
ah
that
might
do
it
all

do
think
it
warranted
if
you
want
to
take
care
of
him
sir
you
can
it
none
of
my
family
business
lil
eyes
blazed
let
me
handle
this
she
said
all
right
rita
stood
up
abruptly
you
do
whatever
you
want
she
said
and
stormed
out
of
the
room
why
are
you
coming
here
for
help
tom
said
ever
the
voice
of
reason
you
seem
capable
enough
i
going
to
be
taking
a
lethal
injection
at
the
end
of
the
week
dan
said
three
days
that
personal
but
you
asked
tom
shook
his
head
friends
you
got
i
could
see
him
thinking
it
that
soon
lil
asked
a
throb
in
her
voice
dan
nodded
in
a
dreamlike
buzz
i
stood
and
wandered
out
into
the
utilidor
out
through
the
western
castmember
parking
and
away
i
wandered
along
the
cobbled
disused
walk
around
the
world
each
flagstone
engraved
with
the
name
of
a
family
that
had
visited
the
park
a
century
before
the
names
whipped
past
me
like
epitaphs
the
sun
came
up
noon
high
as
i
rounded
the
bend
of
deserted
beach
between
the
grand
floridian
and
the
polynesian
lil
and
i
had
come
here
often
to
watch
the
sunset
from
a
hammock
arms
around
each
other
the
park
spread
out
before
us
like
a
lighted
toy
village
now
the
beach
was
deserted
the
wedding
pavilion
silent
i
felt
suddenly
cold
though
i
was
sweating
freely
so
cold
dreamlike
i
walked
into
the
lake
water
filling
my
shoes
logging
my
pants
warm
as
blood
warm
on
my
chest
on
my
chin
on
my
mouth
on
my
eyes
i
opened
my
mouth
and
inhaled
deeply
water
filling
my
lungs
choking
and
warm
at
first
i
sputtered
but
i
was
in
control
now
and
i
inhaled
again
the
water
shimmered
over
my
eyes
and
then
was
dark
i
woke
on
doctor
pete
cot
in
the
magic
kingdom
restraints
around
my
wrists
and
ankles
a
tube
in
my
nose
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
moment
believing
that
i
been
restored
from
a
backup
problems
solved
memories
behind
me
sorrow
knifed
through
me
as
i
realized
that
dan
was
probably
dead
by
now
my
memories
of
him
gone
forever
gradually
i
realized
that
i
was
thinking
nonsensically
the
fact
that
i
remembered
dan
meant
that
i
had
been
refreshed
from
my
backup
that
my
broken
brain
was
still
there
churning
along
in
unmediated
isolation
i
coughed
again
my
ribs
ached
and
throbbed
in
counterpoint
to
my
head
dan
took
my
hand
you
a
pain
in
the
ass
you
know
that
he
said
smiling
sorry
i
choked
you
sure
are
he
said
lucky
for
you
they
found
you
another
minute
or
two
and
i
be
burying
you
right
now
i
thought
confused
have
restored
me
from
then
it
hit
me
i
gone
on
record
refusing
restore
from
backup
after
having
it
recommended
by
a
medical
professional
no
one
would
have
restored
me
after
that
i
would
have
been
truly
and
finally
dead
i
started
to
shiver
easy
dan
said
easy
it
all
right
now
doctor
says
you
got
a
cracked
rib
or
two
from
the
cpr
but
there
no
brain
damage
no
brain
damage
doctor
pete
said
swimming
into
view
he
had
on
his
professionally
calm
bedside
face
and
it
reassured
me
despite
myself
he
shooed
dan
away
and
took
his
seat
once
dan
had
left
the
room
he
shone
lights
in
my
eyes
and
peeked
in
my
ears
then
sat
back
and
considered
me
well
julius
he
said
what
exactly
is
the
problem
we
can
get
you
a
lethal
injection
if
that
what
you
want
but
offing
yourself
in
the
seven
seas
lagoon
just
is
good
show
in
the
meantime
would
you
like
to
talk
about
it
part
of
me
wanted
to
spit
in
his
eye
i
tried
to
talk
about
it
and
he
told
me
to
go
to
hell
and
now
he
changes
his
mind
but
i
did
want
to
talk
i
did
want
to
die
i
said
oh
no
he
said
i
think
the
evidence
suggests
the
contrary
i
was
trying
to
die
i
protested
i
was
trying
to
what
i
was
trying
to
take
the
refresh
without
choosing
it
without
shutting
out
the
last
year
of
my
best
friend
life
rescue
myself
from
the
stinking
pit
i
sunk
into
without
flushing
dan
away
along
with
it
that
all
that
all
i
was
thinking
i
was
just
acting
it
was
an
episode
or
something
does
that
mean
i
nuts
oh
probably
doctor
pete
said
offhandedly
but
let
worry
about
one
thing
at
a
time
you
can
die
if
you
want
to
that
your
right
rather
you
lived
if
you
want
my
opinion
and
i
doubt
that
i
the
only
one
whuffie
be
damned
if
you
going
to
live
i
like
to
record
you
saying
so
just
in
case
we
have
a
backup
of
you
on
file
i
hate
to
have
to
delete
it
yes
i
said
yes
i
like
to
be
restored
if
there
no
other
option
it
was
true
i
did
want
to
die
all
right
then
doctor
pete
said
it
on
file
and
i
a
happy
man
now
are
you
nuts
probably
a
little
nothing
a
little
counseling
and
some
r
r
would
fix
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
could
find
you
somewhere
if
you
want
not
yet
i
said
i
appreciate
the
offer
but
there
something
else
i
have
to
do
first
dan
took
me
back
to
the
room
and
put
me
to
bed
with
a
transdermal
soporific
that
knocked
me
out
for
the
rest
of
the
day
when
i
woke
the
moon
was
over
the
seven
seas
lagoon
and
the
monorail
was
silent
i
stood
on
the
patio
for
a
while
thinking
about
all
the
things
this
place
had
meant
to
me
for
more
than
a
century
happiness
security
efficiency
fantasy
all
of
it
gone
it
was
time
i
left
maybe
back
to
space
find
zed
and
see
if
i
could
make
her
happy
again
anywhere
but
here
once
dan
was
dead
god
it
was
sinking
in
finally
i
could
catch
a
ride
down
to
the
cape
for
a
launch
what
on
your
mind
dan
asked
from
behind
me
startling
me
he
was
in
his
boxers
thin
and
rangy
and
hairy
thinking
about
moving
on
i
said
he
chuckled
i
been
thinking
about
doing
the
same
he
said
i
smiled
not
that
way
i
said
just
going
somewhere
else
starting
over
getting
away
from
this
going
to
take
the
refresh
he
asked
i
looked
away
no
i
said
i
do
believe
i
will
it
may
be
none
of
my
business
he
said
but
why
the
fuck
not
jesus
julius
what
you
afraid
of
you
do
want
to
know
i
said
i
be
the
judge
of
that
let
have
a
drink
first
i
said
dan
rolled
his
eyes
back
for
a
second
then
said
all
right
two
coronas
coming
up
after
the
bot
had
left
we
cracked
the
beers
and
pulled
chairs
out
onto
the
porch
you
sure
you
want
to
know
this
i
asked
he
tipped
his
bottle
at
me
sure
as
shootin
he
said
i
do
want
refresh
because
it
would
mean
losing
the
last
year
i
said
he
nodded
by
which
you
mean
last
year
he
said
right
i
nodded
and
drank
i
thought
it
might
be
like
that
julius
you
are
many
things
but
hard
to
figure
out
you
are
not
i
have
something
to
say
that
might
help
you
make
the
decision
if
you
want
to
hear
it
that
is
what
could
he
have
to
say
sure
i
said
sure
in
my
mind
i
was
on
a
shuttle
headed
for
orbit
away
from
all
of
this
i
had
you
killed
he
said
debra
asked
me
to
and
i
set
it
up
you
were
right
all
along
the
shuttle
exploded
in
silent
slow
moving
space
and
i
spun
away
from
it
i
opened
and
shut
my
mouth
it
was
dan
turn
to
look
away
debra
proposed
it
we
were
talking
about
the
people
i
met
when
i
was
doing
my
missionary
work
the
stone
crazies
who
i
have
to
chase
away
after
they
rejoined
the
bitchun
society
one
of
them
a
girl
from
cheyenne
mountain
she
followed
me
down
here
kept
leaving
me
messages
i
told
debra
and
that
when
she
got
the
idea
i
get
the
girl
to
shoot
you
and
disappear
debra
would
give
me
whuffie
piles
of
it
and
her
team
would
follow
suit
i
be
months
closer
to
my
goal
that
was
all
i
could
think
about
back
then
you
remember
i
remember
the
smell
of
rejuve
and
desperation
in
our
little
cottage
and
dan
plotting
my
death
we
planned
it
then
debra
had
herself
refreshed
from
a
backup
no
memory
of
the
event
just
the
whuffie
for
me
yes
i
said
that
would
work
plan
a
murder
kill
yourself
have
yourself
refreshed
from
a
backup
made
before
the
plan
how
many
times
had
debra
done
terrible
things
and
erased
their
memories
that
way
yes
he
agreed
we
did
it
i
ashamed
to
say
i
can
prove
it
too
i
have
my
backup
and
i
can
get
jeanine
to
tell
it
too
he
drained
his
beer
that
my
plan
tomorrow
i
tell
lil
and
her
folks
kim
and
her
people
the
whole
a
present
from
a
shitty
friend
my
throat
was
dry
and
tight
i
drank
more
beer
you
knew
all
along
i
said
you
could
have
proved
it
at
any
time
he
nodded
that
right
you
let
me
i
groped
for
the
words
you
let
me
turn
into
they
would
come
i
did
he
said
all
this
time
lil
and
he
standing
on
porch
telling
me
i
needed
help
doctor
pete
telling
me
i
needed
refresh
from
backup
me
saying
no
no
no
not
wanting
to
lose
my
last
year
with
dan
i
done
some
pretty
shitty
things
in
my
day
he
said
this
is
the
absolute
worst
you
helped
me
and
i
betrayed
you
i
sure
glad
i
believe
in
god
that
make
what
i
going
to
do
even
scarier
dan
was
going
to
kill
himself
in
two
days
time
my
friend
and
my
murderer
dan
i
croaked
i
could
make
any
sense
of
my
mind
dan
taking
care
of
me
helping
me
sticking
up
for
me
carrying
this
horrible
shame
with
him
all
along
ready
to
die
wanting
to
go
with
a
clean
conscience
you
forgiven
i
said
and
it
was
true
he
stood
where
are
you
going
i
asked
to
find
jeanine
the
one
who
pulled
the
trigger
i
meet
you
at
the
hall
of
presidents
at
nine
i
went
in
through
the
main
gate
not
a
castmember
any
longer
a
guest
with
barely
enough
whuffie
to
scrape
in
use
the
water
fountains
and
stand
in
line
if
i
were
lucky
a
castmember
might
spare
me
a
chocolate
banana
probably
not
though
i
stood
in
the
line
for
the
hall
of
presidents
other
guests
checked
my
whuffie
then
averted
their
eyes
even
the
children
a
year
before
they
have
been
striking
up
conversations
asking
me
about
my
job
here
at
the
magic
kingdom
i
sat
in
my
seat
at
the
hall
of
presidents
watching
the
short
film
with
the
rest
sitting
patiently
while
they
rocked
in
their
seats
under
the
blast
of
the
a
castmember
picked
up
the
stageside
mic
and
thanked
everyone
for
coming
the
doors
swung
open
and
the
hall
was
empty
except
for
me
the
castmember
narrowed
her
eyes
at
me
then
recognizing
me
turned
her
back
and
went
to
show
in
the
next
group
no
group
came
instead
dan
and
the
girl
i
seen
on
the
replay
entered
we
closed
it
down
for
the
morning
he
said
i
was
staring
at
the
girl
seeing
her
smirk
as
she
pulled
the
trigger
on
me
seeing
her
now
with
a
contrite
scared
expression
she
was
terrified
of
me
you
must
be
jeanine
i
said
i
stood
and
shook
her
hand
i
julius
her
hand
was
cold
and
she
took
it
back
and
wiped
it
on
her
pants
my
castmember
instincts
took
over
please
have
a
seat
do
worry
it
all
be
fine
really
no
hard
feelings
i
stopped
short
of
offering
to
get
her
a
glass
of
water
her
at
her
said
a
snotty
voice
in
my
head
make
a
better
witness
or
make
her
nervous
pathetic
that
work
too
make
debra
look
even
i
told
the
voice
to
shut
up
and
got
her
a
cup
of
water
by
the
time
i
came
back
the
whole
gang
was
there
debra
lil
her
folks
tim
debra
gang
and
lil
gang
now
one
united
team
soon
to
be
scattered
dan
took
the
stage
used
the
stageside
mic
to
broadcast
his
voice
eleven
months
ago
i
did
an
awful
thing
i
plotted
with
debra
to
have
julius
murdered
i
used
a
friend
who
was
a
little
confused
at
the
time
used
her
to
pull
the
trigger
it
was
debra
idea
that
having
julius
killed
would
cause
enough
confusion
that
she
could
take
over
the
hall
of
presidents
it
was
there
was
a
roar
of
conversation
i
looked
at
debra
saw
that
she
was
sitting
calmly
as
though
dan
had
just
accused
her
of
sneaking
an
extra
helping
of
dessert
lil
parents
to
either
side
of
her
were
less
sanguine
tom
jaw
was
set
and
angry
rita
was
speaking
angrily
to
debra
hickory
jackson
in
the
old
hall
used
to
say
will
hang
the
first
man
i
can
lay
hands
on
from
the
first
tree
i
can
debra
had
herself
refreshed
from
backup
after
we
planned
it
dan
went
on
as
though
no
one
was
talking
i
was
supposed
to
do
the
same
but
i
did
i
have
a
backup
in
my
public
directory
anyone
can
examine
it
right
now
i
like
to
bring
jeanine
up
she
got
a
few
words
like
to
say
i
helped
jeanine
take
the
stage
she
was
still
trembling
and
the
were
an
insensate
babble
of
recriminations
despite
myself
i
was
enjoying
it
hello
jeanine
said
softly
she
had
a
lovely
voice
a
lovely
face
i
wondered
if
we
could
be
friends
when
it
was
all
over
she
probably
did
care
much
about
whuffie
one
way
or
another
the
discussion
went
on
dan
took
the
mic
from
her
and
said
please
can
we
have
a
little
respect
for
our
visitor
please
people
gradually
the
din
decreased
dan
passed
the
mic
back
to
jeanine
hello
she
said
again
and
flinched
from
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
hall
my
name
is
jeanine
i
the
one
who
killed
julius
a
year
ago
dan
asked
me
to
and
i
did
it
i
did
ask
why
i
trusted
trust
him
he
told
me
that
julius
would
make
a
backup
a
few
minutes
before
i
shot
him
and
that
he
could
get
me
out
of
the
park
without
getting
caught
i
very
sorry
there
was
something
about
her
some
stilt
to
her
stance
and
words
that
let
you
know
she
was
all
there
growing
up
in
a
mountain
might
do
that
to
you
i
snuck
a
look
at
lil
whose
lips
were
pressed
together
growing
up
in
a
theme
park
might
do
that
to
you
too
thank
you
jeanine
dan
said
taking
back
the
mic
you
can
have
a
seat
now
i
said
everything
i
need
to
say
julius
and
i
have
had
our
own
discussions
in
private
if
there
anyone
else
who
like
to
speak
the
words
were
barely
out
of
his
mouth
before
the
crowd
erupted
again
in
words
and
waving
hands
beside
me
jeanine
flinched
i
took
her
hand
and
shouted
in
her
ear
have
you
ever
been
on
the
pirates
of
the
carribean
she
shook
her
head
i
stood
up
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
you
love
it
i
said
and
led
her
out
of
the
hall
chapter
i
booked
us
ringside
seats
at
the
polynesian
luau
riding
high
on
a
fresh
round
of
sympathy
whuffie
and
dan
and
i
drank
a
dozen
in
pineapples
before
giving
up
on
the
idea
of
getting
drunk
jeanine
watched
the
and
the
with
eyes
like
saucers
and
picked
daintily
at
her
spare
ribs
with
one
hand
never
averting
her
attention
from
the
floor
show
when
they
danced
the
fast
hula
her
eyes
jiggled
i
chuckled
from
where
we
sat
i
could
see
the
spot
where
i
waded
into
the
seven
seas
lagoon
and
breathed
in
the
water
i
could
see
cinderella
castle
across
the
lagoon
i
could
see
the
monorails
and
the
ferries
and
the
busses
making
their
busy
way
through
the
park
shuttling
teeming
masses
of
guests
from
place
to
place
dan
toasted
me
with
his
pineapple
and
i
toasted
him
back
drank
it
dry
and
belched
in
satisfaction
full
belly
good
friends
and
the
sunset
behind
a
troupe
of
tawny
naked
hula
dancers
who
needs
the
bitchun
society
anyway
when
it
was
over
we
watched
the
fireworks
from
the
beach
my
toes
dug
into
the
clean
white
sand
dan
slipped
his
hand
into
my
left
hand
and
jeanine
took
my
right
when
the
sky
darkened
and
the
lighted
barges
puttered
away
through
the
night
we
three
sat
in
the
hammock
i
looked
out
over
the
seven
seas
lagoon
and
realized
that
this
was
my
last
night
ever
in
walt
disney
world
it
was
time
to
reboot
again
start
afresh
that
what
the
park
was
for
only
somehow
this
visit
i
gotten
stuck
dan
had
unstuck
me
the
talk
turned
to
dan
impending
death
so
tell
me
what
you
think
of
this
he
said
hauling
away
on
a
glowing
cigarette
shoot
i
said
i
thinking
why
take
lethal
injection
i
mean
i
may
be
done
here
for
now
but
why
should
i
make
an
irreversible
decision
why
did
you
want
to
before
i
asked
oh
it
was
the
macho
thing
i
guess
the
finality
and
all
but
hell
i
do
have
to
prove
anything
right
sure
i
said
magnanimously
so
he
said
thoughtfully
the
question
i
asking
is
how
long
can
i
deadhead
for
there
are
folks
who
go
down
for
a
thousand
years
ten
thousand
right
so
you
thinking
what
a
million
i
joked
he
laughed
a
you
thinking
too
small
son
try
this
on
for
size
the
heat
death
of
the
universe
the
heat
death
of
the
universe
i
repeated
sure
he
drawled
and
i
sensed
his
grin
in
the
dark
ten
to
the
hundred
years
or
so
the
stelliferous
period
it
when
all
the
black
holes
have
run
dry
and
things
get
you
know
stupendously
dull
cold
too
so
i
thinking
why
not
leave
a
call
for
some
time
around
then
sounds
unpleasant
to
me
i
said
brrrr
not
at
all
i
figure
canopic
jar
mass
enough
to
feed
it
say
a
asteroid
and
a
lot
of
solitude
when
the
time
comes
around
i
poke
my
head
in
every
century
or
so
just
to
see
what
what
but
if
nothing
really
stupendous
crops
up
i
take
the
long
ride
out
the
final
frontier
that
pretty
cool
jeanine
said
thanks
dan
said
you
not
kidding
are
you
i
asked
nope
i
sure
ai
he
said
they
did
invite
me
back
into
the
even
after
debra
left
in
and
they
started
to
put
the
mansion
back
the
way
it
was
tim
called
me
to
say
that
with
enough
support
from
imagineering
they
thought
they
could
get
it
up
and
running
in
a
week
suneep
was
ready
to
kill
someone
i
swear
house
divided
against
itself
as
lincoln
used
to
say
at
the
hall
of
presidents
i
packed
three
changes
of
clothes
and
a
toothbrush
in
my
shoulderbag
and
checked
out
of
my
suite
at
the
polynesian
at
ten
then
met
jeanine
and
dan
at
the
valet
parking
out
front
dan
had
a
runabout
he
picked
up
with
my
whuffie
and
i
piled
in
with
jeanine
in
the
middle
we
played
old
beatles
tunes
on
the
stereo
all
the
long
way
to
cape
canaveral
our
shuttle
lifted
at
noon
the
shuttle
docked
four
hours
later
but
by
the
time
we
been
through
decontam
and
orientation
it
was
suppertime
dan
nearly
as
as
debra
after
his
confession
nevertheless
treated
us
to
a
meal
in
the
big
bubble
of
heady
booze
and
steaky
paste
and
we
watched
the
universe
get
colder
for
a
while
there
were
a
couple
guys
jamming
tethered
to
a
guitar
and
a
set
of
tubs
and
they
were
half
bad
jeanine
was
uncomfortable
hanging
there
naked
she
gone
to
space
with
her
folks
after
dan
had
left
the
mountain
but
it
was
in
a
generation
ship
she
abandoned
it
after
a
year
or
two
and
deadheaded
back
to
earth
in
a
she
get
used
to
life
in
space
after
a
while
or
she
would
well
dan
said
yup
i
said
aping
his
laconic
drawl
he
smiled
it
that
time
he
said
spheres
of
saline
tears
formed
in
jeanine
eyes
and
i
brushed
them
away
setting
them
adrift
in
the
bubble
i
developed
some
real
tender
type
feelings
for
her
since
i
watched
her
her
way
through
the
magic
kingdom
no
romance
not
for
me
thanks
but
camaraderie
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
see
you
in
ten
to
the
hundred
dan
said
and
headed
to
the
airlock
i
started
after
him
but
jeanine
caught
my
hand
he
hates
long
she
said
i
know
i
said
and
watched
him
go
the
universe
gets
older
so
do
i
so
does
my
backup
sitting
in
redundant
distributed
storage
dirtside
ready
for
the
day
that
space
or
age
or
stupidity
kills
me
it
recedes
with
the
years
and
i
write
out
my
life
longhand
a
letter
to
the
me
that
i
be
when
it
restored
into
a
clone
somewhere
somewhen
it
important
that
whoever
i
am
then
knows
about
this
year
and
it
going
to
take
a
lot
of
tries
for
me
to
get
it
right
in
the
meantime
i
working
on
another
symphony
one
with
a
little
bit
of
grim
grinning
ghosts
and
a
nod
to
it
a
small
world
after
all
and
especially
there
a
great
big
beautiful
tomorrow
jeanine
says
it
pretty
good
but
what
does
she
know
she
barely
fifty
we
both
got
a
lot
of
living
to

a
novel
by
cory
doctorow
jules
is
a
young
man
barely
a
century
old
he
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
cure
for
death
and
the
end
of
scarcity
to
learn
ten
languages
and
compose
three
symphonies
and
to
realize
his
boyhood
dream
of
taking
up
residence
in
disney
world
disney
world
the
greatest
artistic
achievement
of
the
long
ago
twentieth
century
now
in
the
care
of
a
network
of
volunteer
ad
hocs
who
keep
the
classic
attractions
running
as
they
always
have
enhanced
with
only
the
smallest
high
tech
touches
now
though
it
seems
the
ad
hocs
are
under
attack
a
new
group
has
taken
over
the
hall
of
the
presidents
and
is
replacing
its
venerable
audioanimatronics
with
new
immersive
direct
to
brain
interfaces
that
give
guests
the
illusion
of
being
washington
lincoln
and
all
the
others
for
jules
this
is
an
attack
on
the
artistic
purity
of
disney
world
itself
worse
it
appears
this
new
group
has
had
jules
killed
this
upsets
him
it
only
his
fourth
death
and
revival
after
all
now
it
war
war
for
the
soul
of
the
magic
kingdom
a
war
of
ever
shifting
reputations
technical
wizardry
and
entirely
unpredictable
outcomes
bursting
with
cutting
edge
speculation
and
human
insight
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
reads
like
neal
stephenson
meets
nick
hornby
a
coming
of
age
romantic
comedy
and
a
kick
butt
