hans
brinker
or
the
silver
skates
by
mary
mapes
dodge
to
my
father
james
mapes
this
book
is
dedicated
in
gratitude
and
love
preface
this
little
work
aims
to
combine
the
instructive
features
of
a
book
of
travels
with
the
interest
of
a
domestic
tale
throughout
its
pages
the
descriptions
of
dutch
localities
customs
and
general
characteristics
have
been
given
with
scrupulous
care
many
of
its
incidents
are
drawn
from
life
and
the
story
of
raff
brinker
is
founded
strictly
upon
fact
while
acknowledging
my
obligations
to
many
writers
on
dutch
history
literature
and
art
i
turn
with
especial
gratitude
to
those
kind
holland
friends
who
with
generous
zeal
have
taken
many
a
backward
glance
at
their
country
for
my
sake
seeing
it
as
it
looked
twenty
years
ago
when
the
brinker
home
stood
unnoticed
in
sunlight
and
shadow
should
this
simple
narrative
serve
to
give
my
young
readers
a
just
idea
of
holland
and
its
resources
or
present
true
pictures
of
its
inhabitants
and
their
life
or
free
them
from
certain
current
prejudices
concerning
that
noble
and
enterprising
people
the
leading
desire
in
writing
it
will
have
been
satisfied
should
it
cause
even
one
heart
to
feel
a
deeper
trust
in
god
s
goodness
and
love
or
aid
any
in
weaving
a
life
wherein
through
knots
and
entanglements
the
golden
thread
shall
never
be
tarnished
or
broken
the
prayer
with
which
it
was
begun
and
ended
will
have
been
answered
a
letter
from
holland
amsterdam
july
dear
boys
and
girls
at
home
if
you
all
could
be
here
with
me
today
what
fine
times
we
might
have
walking
through
this
beautiful
dutch
city
how
we
should
stare
at
the
crooked
houses
standing
with
their
gable
ends
to
the
street
at
the
little
slanting
mirrors
fastened
outside
of
the
windows
at
the
wooden
shoes
and
dogcarts
nearby
the
windmills
in
the
distance
at
the
great
warehouses
at
the
canals
doing
the
double
duty
of
streets
and
rivers
and
at
the
singular
mingling
of
trees
and
masts
to
be
seen
in
every
direction
ah
it
would
be
pleasant
indeed
but
here
i
sit
in
a
great
hotel
looking
out
upon
all
these
things
knowing
quite
well
that
not
even
the
spirit
of
the
dutch
which
seems
able
to
accomplish
anything
can
bring
you
at
this
moment
across
the
moment
there
is
one
comfort
however
in
going
through
these
wonderful
holland
towns
without
you
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
any
of
the
party
tumble
into
the
canals
and
then
these
lumbering
dutch
wagons
with
their
heavy
wheels
so
very
far
apart
what
should
i
do
if
a
few
dozen
of
you
were
to
fall
under
them
and
perhaps
one
of
the
wildest
of
my
boys
might
harm
a
stork
and
then
all
holland
would
be
against
us
no
it
is
better
as
it
is
you
will
be
coming
one
by
one
as
years
go
on
to
see
the
whole
thing
for
yourselves
holland
is
as
wonderful
today
as
it
was
when
more
than
twenty
years
ago
hans
and
gretel
skated
on
the
frozen
y
in
fact
more
wonderful
for
every
day
increases
the
marvel
of
its
not
being
washed
away
by
the
sea
its
cities
have
grown
and
some
of
its
peculiarities
have
been
washed
away
by
contact
with
other
nations
but
it
is
holland
still
and
always
will
be
full
of
oddity
courage
and
industry
the
pluckiest
little
country
on
earth
i
shall
not
tell
you
in
this
letter
of
its
customs
its
cities
its
palaces
churches
picture
galleries
and
museums
for
these
are
described
in
the
story
except
to
say
that
they
are
here
still
just
the
same
in
this
good
year
for
i
have
seen
them
nearly
all
within
a
week
today
an
american
boy
and
i
seeing
some
children
enter
an
old
house
in
the
business
part
of
amsterdam
followed
them
in
and
what
do
you
think
we
found
an
old
woman
here
in
the
middle
of
summer
selling
hot
water
and
fire
she
makes
her
living
by
it
all
day
long
she
sits
tending
her
great
fires
of
peat
and
keeping
the
shining
copper
tanks
above
them
filled
with
water
the
children
who
come
and
go
carry
away
in
a
curious
stone
pail
their
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
their
blocks
of
burning
peat
for
these
they
give
her
a
dutch
cent
which
is
worth
less
than
half
of
one
of
ours
in
this
way
persons
who
can
not
afford
to
keep
a
fire
burning
in
hot
weather
may
yet
have
their
cup
of
tea
or
coffee
and
bit
of
boiled
fish
and
potato
after
leaving
the
old
fire
woman
who
nodded
a
pleasant
to
us
and
willingly
put
our
stivers
in
her
great
outside
pocket
we
drove
through
the
streets
enjoying
the
singular
sights
of
a
public
washing
day
yes
in
certain
quarters
of
the
city
away
from
the
canals
the
streets
were
lively
with
washerwomen
hard
at
work
hundreds
of
them
in
clumsy
wooden
shoes
with
their
skirts
bare
arms
and
caps
were
bending
over
tall
wooden
tubs
that
reached
as
high
as
their
waists
gossiping
and
rubbing
rubbing
and
gossiping
with
perfect
unconcern
in
the
public
thoroughfare
and
all
washing
with
cold
water
instead
of
using
hot
as
we
do
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
be
for
our
old
fire
woman
if
boiling
water
were
suddenly
to
become
the
fashion
on
these
public
washing
days
and
now
goodbye
oh
i
must
tell
you
one
more
thing
we
found
today
in
an
amsterdam
bookstore
this
story
of
hans
brinker
told
in
dutch
it
is
a
volume
beautifully
printed
and
with
colored
pictures
but
filled
with
such
astounding
words
that
it
really
made
me
feel
sorry
for
the
little
hollanders
who
are
to
read
them
again
in
the
touching
words
of
our
dutch
translator
with
whom
i
m
sure
you
ll
heartily
agree

conclusion
hans
and
gretel
on
a
bright
december
morning
long
ago
two
thinly
clad
children
were
kneeling
upon
the
bank
of
a
frozen
canal
in
holland
the
sun
had
not
yet
appeared
but
the
gray
sky
was
parted
near
the
horizon
and
its
edges
shone
crimson
with
the
coming
day
most
of
the
good
hollanders
were
enjoying
a
placid
morning
nap
even
mynheer
von
stoppelnoze
that
worthy
old
dutchman
was
still
slumbering
in
beautiful
repose
now
and
then
some
peasant
woman
poising
a
basket
upon
her
head
came
skimming
over
the
glassy
surface
of
the
canal
or
a
lusty
boy
skating
to
his
day
s
work
in
the
town
cast
a
grimace
toward
the
shivering
pair
as
he
flew
along
meanwhile
with
many
a
vigorous
puff
and
pull
the
brother
and
sister
for
such
they
were
seemed
to
be
fastening
something
to
their
feet
not
skates
certainly
but
clumsy
pieces
of
wood
narrowed
and
smoothed
at
their
lower
edge
and
pierced
with
holes
through
which
were
threaded
strings
of
rawhide
these
affairs
had
been
made
by
the
boy
hans
his
mother
was
a
poor
peasant
woman
too
poor
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
as
buying
skates
for
her
little
ones
rough
as
these
were
they
had
afforded
the
children
many
a
happy
hour
upon
the
ice
and
now
as
with
cold
red
fingers
our
young
hollanders
tugged
at
the
strings
their
solemn
faces
bending
closely
over
their
knees
no
vision
of
impossible
iron
runners
came
to
dull
the
satisfaction
glowing
within
in
a
moment
the
boy
arose
and
with
a
pompous
swing
of
the
arms
and
a
careless
come
on
gretel
glided
easily
across
the
canal
ah
hans
called
his
sister
plaintively
this
foot
is
not
well
yet
the
strings
hurt
me
on
last
market
day
and
now
i
can
not
bear
them
tied
in
the
same
tie
them
higher
up
then
answered
hans
as
without
looking
at
her
he
performed
a
wonderful
cat
s
cradle
step
on
the
ice
how
can
i
the
string
is
too
giving
vent
to
a
dutch
whistle
the
english
of
which
was
that
girls
were
troublesome
creatures
he
steered
toward
her
you
are
foolish
to
wear
such
shoes
gretel
when
you
have
a
stout
leather
pair
your
klompen
wooden
shoes
would
be
better
than
why
hans
do
you
forget
the
father
threw
my
beautiful
new
shoes
in
the
fire
before
i
knew
what
he
had
done
they
were
all
curled
up
in
the
midst
o
the
burning
peat
i
can
skate
with
these
but
not
with
my
wooden
ones
be
careful
now
hans
had
taken
a
string
from
his
pocket
humming
a
tune
as
he
knelt
beside
her
he
proceeded
to
fasten
gretel
s
skate
with
all
the
force
of
his
strong
young
arm
oh
oh
she
cried
in
real
pain
with
an
impatient
jerk
hans
unwound
the
string
he
would
have
cast
it
on
the
ground
in
true
style
had
he
not
just
then
spied
a
tear
trickling
down
his
sister
s
cheek
i
ll
fix
it
never
fear
he
said
with
sudden
tenderness
but
we
must
be
quick
the
mother
will
need
us
then
he
glanced
inquiringly
about
him
first
at
the
ground
next
at
some
bare
willow
branches
above
his
head
and
finally
at
the
sky
now
gorgeous
with
streaks
of
blue
crimson
and
gold
finding
nothing
in
any
of
these
localities
to
meet
his
need
his
eye
suddenly
brightened
as
with
the
air
of
a
fellow
who
knew
what
he
was
about
he
took
off
his
cap
and
removing
the
tattered
lining
adjusted
it
in
a
smooth
pad
over
the
top
of
gretel
s
shoe
now
he
cried
triumphantly
at
the
same
time
arranging
the
strings
as
briskly
as
his
benumbed
fingers
would
allow
can
you
bear
some
pulling
gretel
drew
up
her
lips
as
if
to
say
hurt
away
but
made
no
further
response
in
another
moment
they
were
all
laughing
together
as
hand
in
hand
they
flew
along
the
canal
never
thinking
whether
the
ice
would
bear
them
or
not
for
in
holland
ice
is
generally
an
affair
it
settles
itself
upon
the
water
in
a
determined
kind
of
way
and
so
far
from
growing
thin
and
uncertain
every
time
the
sun
is
a
little
severe
upon
it
it
gathers
its
forces
day
by
day
and
flashes
defiance
to
every
beam
presently
squeak
squeak
sounded
something
beneath
hans
feet
next
his
strokes
grew
shorter
ending
oftimes
with
a
jerk
and
finally
he
lay
sprawling
upon
the
ice
kicking
against
the
air
with
many
a
fantastic
flourish
ha
ha
laughed
gretel
that
was
a
fine
tumble
but
a
tender
heart
was
beating
under
her
coarse
blue
jacket
and
even
as
she
laughed
she
came
with
a
graceful
sweep
close
to
her
prostrate
brother
are
you
hurt
hans
oh
you
are
laughing
catch
me
now
and
she
darted
away
shivering
no
longer
but
with
cheeks
all
aglow
and
eyes
sparkling
with
fun
hans
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
in
brisk
pursuit
but
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
catch
gretel
before
she
had
traveled
very
far
her
skates
too
began
to
squeak
believing
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
she
turned
suddenly
and
skated
into
her
pursuer
s
arms
ha
ha
i
ve
caught
you
cried
hans
ha
ha
i
caught
you
she
retorted
struggling
to
free
herself
just
then
a
clear
quick
voice
was
heard
calling
hans
gretel
it
s
the
mother
said
hans
looking
solemn
in
an
instant
by
this
time
the
canal
was
gilded
with
sunlight
the
pure
morning
air
was
very
delightful
and
skaters
were
gradually
increasing
in
numbers
it
was
hard
to
obey
the
summons
but
gretel
and
hans
were
good
children
without
a
thought
of
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
linger
they
pulled
off
their
skates
leaving
half
the
knots
still
tied
hans
with
his
great
square
shoulders
and
bushy
yellow
hair
towered
high
above
his
little
sister
as
they
trudged
homeward
he
was
fifteen
years
old
and
gretel
was
only
twelve
he
was
a
solid
boy
with
honest
eyes
and
a
brow
that
seemed
to
bear
a
sign
goodness
within
just
as
the
little
dutch
zomerhuis
summer
house
wears
a
motto
over
its
portal
gretel
was
lithe
and
quick
her
eyes
had
a
dancing
light
in
them
and
while
you
looked
at
her
cheek
the
color
paled
and
deepened
just
as
it
does
upon
a
bed
of
pink
and
white
blossoms
when
the
wind
is
blowing
as
soon
as
the
children
turned
from
the
canal
they
could
see
their
parents
cottage
their
mother
s
tall
form
arrayed
in
jacket
and
petticoat
and
cap
stood
like
a
picture
in
the
crooked
frame
of
the
doorway
had
the
cottage
been
a
mile
away
it
would
still
have
seemed
near
in
that
flat
country
every
object
stands
out
plainly
in
the
distance
the
chickens
show
as
distinctly
as
the
windmills
indeed
were
it
not
for
the
dikes
and
the
high
banks
of
the
canals
one
could
stand
almost
anywhere
in
middle
holland
without
seeing
a
mound
or
a
ridge
between
the
eye
and
the
none
had
better
cause
to
know
the
nature
of
these
same
dikes
than
dame
brinker
and
the
panting
youngsters
now
running
at
her
call
but
before
stating
why
let
me
ask
you
to
take
a
trip
with
me
to
that
far
country
where
you
may
see
perhaps
for
the
first
time
some
curious
things
that
hans
and
gretel
saw
every
day
holland
holland
is
one
of
the
queerest
countries
under
the
sun
it
should
be
called
or
for
in
nearly
everything
it
is
different
from
the
other
parts
of
the
world
in
the
first
place
a
large
portion
of
the
country
is
lower
than
the
level
of
the
sea
great
dikes
or
bulwarks
have
been
erected
at
a
heavy
cost
of
money
and
labor
to
keep
the
ocean
where
it
belongs
on
certain
parts
of
the
coast
it
sometimes
leans
with
all
its
weight
against
the
land
and
it
is
as
much
as
the
poor
country
can
do
to
stand
the
pressure
sometimes
the
dikes
give
way
or
spring
a
leak
and
the
most
disastrous
results
ensue
they
are
high
and
wide
and
the
tops
of
some
of
them
are
covered
with
buildings
and
trees
they
have
even
fine
public
roads
on
them
from
which
horses
may
look
down
upon
wayside
cottages
often
the
keels
of
floating
ships
are
higher
than
the
roofs
of
the
dwellings
the
stork
clattering
to
her
young
on
the
house
peak
may
feel
that
her
nest
is
lifted
far
out
of
danger
but
the
croaking
frog
in
neighboring
bulrushes
is
nearer
the
stars
than
she
water
bugs
dart
backward
and
forward
above
the
heads
of
the
chimney
swallows
and
willow
trees
seem
drooping
with
shame
because
they
can
not
reach
as
high
as
the
reeds
nearby
ditches
canals
ponds
rivers
and
lakes
are
everywhere
to
be
seen
high
but
not
dry
they
shine
in
the
sunlight
catching
nearly
all
the
bustle
and
the
business
quite
scorning
the
tame
fields
stretching
damply
beside
them
one
is
tempted
to
ask
which
is
holland
the
shores
or
the
water
the
very
verdure
that
should
be
confined
to
the
land
has
made
a
mistake
and
settled
upon
the
fish
ponds
in
fact
the
entire
country
is
a
kind
of
saturated
sponge
or
as
the
english
poet
butler
called
it
a
land
that
rides
at
anchor
and
is
moor
d
in
which
they
do
not
live
but
go
aboard
persons
are
born
live
and
die
and
even
have
their
gardens
on
farmhouses
with
roofs
like
great
slouched
hats
pulled
over
their
eyes
stand
on
wooden
legs
with
a
sort
of
air
as
if
to
say
we
intend
to
keep
dry
if
we
even
the
horses
wear
a
wide
stool
on
each
hoof
as
if
to
lift
them
out
of
the
mire
in
short
the
landscape
everywhere
suggests
a
paradise
for
ducks
it
is
a
glorious
country
in
summer
for
barefoot
girls
and
boys
such
wading
such
mimic
ship
sailing
such
rowing
fishing
and
swimming
only
think
of
a
chain
of
puddles
where
one
can
launch
chip
boats
all
day
long
and
never
make
a
return
trip
but
enough
a
full
recital
would
set
all
young
america
rushing
in
a
body
toward
the
zuider
zee
dutch
cities
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
a
bewildering
jungle
of
houses
bridges
churches
and
ships
sprouting
into
masts
steeples
and
trees
in
some
cities
vessels
are
hitched
like
horses
to
their
owners
doorposts
and
receive
their
freight
from
the
upper
windows
mothers
scream
to
lodewyk
and
kassy
not
to
swing
on
the
garden
gate
for
fear
they
may
be
drowned
water
roads
are
more
frequent
there
than
common
roads
and
railways
water
fences
in
the
form
of
lazy
green
ditches
enclose
farm
and
garden
sometimes
fine
green
hedges
are
seen
but
wooden
fences
such
as
we
have
in
america
are
rarely
met
with
in
holland
as
for
stone
fences
a
dutchman
would
lift
his
hands
with
astonishment
at
the
very
idea
there
is
no
stone
there
except
for
those
great
masses
of
rock
that
have
been
brought
from
other
lands
to
strengthen
and
protect
the
coast
all
the
small
stones
or
pebbles
if
there
ever
were
any
seem
to
be
imprisoned
in
pavements
or
quite
melted
away
boys
with
strong
quick
arms
may
grow
from
pinafores
to
full
beards
without
ever
finding
one
to
start
the
water
rings
or
set
the
rabbits
flying
the
water
roads
are
nothing
less
than
canals
intersecting
the
country
in
every
direction
these
are
of
all
sizes
from
the
great
north
holland
ship
canal
which
is
the
wonder
of
the
world
to
those
which
a
boy
can
leap
water
omnibuses
called
trekschuiten
canal
boats
some
of
the
first
named
are
over
thirty
feet
long
they
look
like
green
houses
lodged
on
barges
and
are
drawn
by
horses
walking
along
the
bank
of
the
canal
the
trekschuiten
are
divided
into
two
compartments
first
and
second
class
and
when
not
too
crowded
the
passengers
make
themselves
quite
at
home
in
them
the
men
smoke
the
women
knit
or
sew
while
children
play
upon
the
small
outer
deck
many
of
the
canal
boats
have
white
yellow
or
sails
this
last
color
is
caused
by
a
tanning
preparation
which
is
put
on
to
preserve
them
constantly
ply
up
and
down
these
roads
for
the
conveyance
of
passengers
and
water
drays
called
pakschuyten
are
used
for
carrying
fuel
and
merchandise
instead
of
green
country
lanes
green
canals
stretch
from
field
to
barn
and
from
barn
to
garden
and
the
farms
or
polders
as
they
are
termed
are
merely
great
lakes
pumped
dry
some
of
the
busiest
streets
are
water
while
many
of
the
country
roads
are
paved
with
brick
the
city
boats
with
their
rounded
sterns
gilded
prows
and
gaily
painted
sides
are
unlike
any
others
under
the
sun
and
a
dutch
wagon
with
its
funny
little
crooked
pole
is
a
perfect
mystery
of
mysteries
one
thing
is
clear
cries
master
brightside
the
inhabitants
need
never
be
but
no
is
true
to
itself
still
notwithstanding
the
sea
pushing
to
get
in
and
the
lakes
struggling
to
get
out
and
the
overflowing
canals
rivers
and
ditches
in
many
districts
there
is
no
water
fit
to
swallow
our
poor
hollanders
must
go
dry
or
drink
wine
and
beer
or
send
far
into
the
inland
to
utrecht
and
other
favored
localities
for
that
precious
fluid
older
than
adam
yet
younger
than
the
morning
dew
sometimes
indeed
the
inhabitants
can
swallow
a
shower
when
they
are
provided
with
any
means
of
catching
it
but
generally
they
are
like
the
sailors
in
coleridge
s
famous
poem
the
ancient
they
see
water
water
everywhere
nor
any
drop
to
drink
great
flapping
windmills
all
over
the
country
make
it
look
as
if
flocks
of
huge
sea
birds
were
just
settling
upon
it
everywhere
one
sees
the
funniest
trees
bobbed
into
fantastical
shapes
with
their
trunks
painted
a
dazzling
white
yellow
or
red
horses
are
often
yoked
three
abreast
men
women
and
children
go
clattering
about
in
wooden
shoes
with
loose
heels
peasant
girls
who
can
not
get
beaux
for
love
hire
them
for
money
to
escort
them
to
the
kermis
fair
and
husbands
and
wives
lovingly
harness
themselves
side
by
side
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
and
drag
their
pakschuyts
to
market
another
peculiar
feature
of
holland
is
the
dune
or
sand
hill
these
are
numerous
along
certain
portions
of
the
coast
before
they
were
sown
with
coarse
reed
grass
and
other
plants
to
hold
them
down
they
used
to
send
great
storms
of
sand
over
the
inland
so
to
add
to
the
oddities
the
farmers
sometimes
dig
down
under
the
surface
to
find
their
soil
and
on
windy
days
dry
showers
of
sand
often
fall
upon
fields
that
have
grown
wet
under
a
week
of
sunshine
in
short
almost
the
only
familiar
thing
we
yankees
can
meet
with
in
holland
is
a
harvest
song
which
is
quite
popular
there
though
no
linguist
could
translate
it
even
then
we
must
shut
our
eyes
and
listen
only
to
the
tune
which
i
leave
you
to
guess
yanker
didee
dudel
down
didee
dudel
lawnter
yankee
viver
voover
vown
botermelk
and
tawnter
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
oddities
of
holland
serve
only
to
prove
the
thrift
and
perseverance
of
the
people
there
is
not
a
richer
or
more
carefully
tilled
garden
spot
in
the
whole
world
than
this
leaky
springy
little
country
there
is
not
a
braver
more
heroic
race
than
its
quite
inhabitants
few
nations
have
equalled
it
in
important
discoveries
and
inventions
none
has
excelled
it
in
commerce
navigation
learning
and
science
or
set
as
noble
examples
in
the
promotion
of
education
and
public
charities
and
none
in
proportion
to
its
extent
has
expended
more
money
or
labor
upon
public
works
holland
has
its
shining
annals
of
noble
and
illustrious
men
and
women
its
grand
historic
records
of
patience
resistance
and
victory
its
religious
freedom
its
enlightened
enterprise
its
art
music
and
literature
it
has
truly
been
called
the
battlefield
of
europe
as
truly
may
we
consider
it
the
asylum
of
the
world
for
the
oppressed
of
every
nation
have
there
found
shelter
and
encouragement
if
we
americans
who
after
all
are
homeopathic
preparations
of
holland
stock
can
laugh
at
the
dutch
and
call
them
human
beavers
and
hint
that
their
country
may
float
off
any
day
at
high
tide
we
can
also
feel
proud
and
say
they
have
proved
themselves
heroes
and
that
their
country
will
not
float
off
while
there
is
a
dutchman
left
to
grapple
it
there
are
said
to
be
at
least
hundred
large
windmills
in
holland
with
sails
ranging
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
long
they
are
employed
in
sawing
timber
beating
hemp
grinding
and
many
other
kinds
of
work
but
their
principal
use
is
for
pumping
water
from
the
lowlands
into
the
canals
and
for
guarding
against
the
inland
freshets
that
so
often
deluge
the
country
their
yearly
cost
is
said
to
be
nearly
ten
million
dollars
the
large
ones
are
of
great
power
the
huge
circular
tower
rising
sometimes
from
the
midst
of
factory
buildings
is
surmounted
with
a
smaller
one
tapering
into
a
caplike
roof
this
upper
tower
is
encircled
at
its
base
with
a
balcony
high
above
which
juts
the
axis
turned
by
its
four
prodigious
sails
many
of
the
windmills
are
primitive
affairs
seeming
sadly
in
need
of
yankee
improvements
but
some
of
the
new
ones
are
admirable
they
are
constructed
so
that
by
some
ingenious
contrivance
they
present
their
fans
or
wings
to
the
wind
in
precisely
the
right
direction
to
work
with
the
requisite
power
in
other
words
the
miller
may
take
a
nap
and
feel
quite
sure
that
his
mill
will
study
the
wind
and
make
the
most
of
it
until
he
wakens
should
there
be
but
a
slight
current
of
air
every
sail
will
spread
itself
to
catch
the
faintest
breath
but
if
a
heavy
blow
should
come
they
will
shrink
at
its
touch
like
great
mimosa
leaves
and
only
give
it
half
a
chance
to
move
them
one
of
the
old
prisons
of
amsterdam
called
the
rasphouse
because
the
thieves
and
vagrants
who
were
confined
there
were
employed
in
rasping
logwood
had
a
cell
for
the
punishment
of
lazy
prisoners
in
one
corner
of
this
cell
was
a
pump
and
in
another
an
opening
through
which
a
steady
stream
of
water
was
admitted
the
prisoner
could
take
his
choice
either
to
stand
still
and
be
drowned
or
to
work
for
dear
life
at
the
pump
and
keep
the
flood
down
until
his
jailer
chose
to
relieve
him
now
it
seems
to
me
that
throughout
holland
nature
has
introduced
this
little
diversion
on
a
grand
scale
the
dutch
have
always
been
forced
to
pump
for
their
very
existence
and
probably
must
continue
to
do
so
to
the
end
of
time
every
year
millions
of
dollars
are
spent
in
repairing
dikes
and
regulating
water
levels
if
these
important
duties
were
neglected
the
country
would
be
uninhabitable
already
dreadful
consequences
as
i
have
said
have
followed
the
bursting
of
these
dikes
hundreds
of
villages
and
towns
have
from
time
to
time
been
buried
beneath
the
rush
of
waters
and
nearly
a
million
persons
have
been
destroyed
one
of
the
most
fearful
inundations
ever
known
occurred
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
terrible
floods
had
before
that
time
overwhelmed
portions
of
holland
but
this
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
the
unhappy
country
had
long
been
suffering
under
spanish
tyranny
now
it
seemed
the
crowning
point
was
given
to
its
troubles
when
we
read
motley
s
history
of
the
rise
of
the
dutch
republic
we
learn
to
revere
the
brave
people
who
have
endured
suffered
and
dared
so
much
motley
in
his
thrilling
account
of
the
great
inundation
tells
us
how
a
and
violent
gale
had
been
sweeping
the
atlantic
waters
into
the
north
sea
piling
them
against
the
coasts
of
the
dutch
provinces
how
the
dikes
taxed
beyond
their
strength
burst
in
all
directions
how
even
the
a
bulwark
formed
of
oaken
piles
braced
with
iron
moored
with
heavy
anchors
and
secured
by
gravel
and
granite
was
snapped
to
pieces
like
thread
how
fishing
boats
and
bulky
vessels
floating
up
into
the
country
became
entangled
among
the
trees
or
beat
in
the
roofs
and
walls
of
dwellings
and
how
at
last
all
friesland
was
converted
into
an
angry
sea
multitudes
of
men
women
children
of
horses
oxen
sheep
and
every
domestic
animal
were
struggling
in
the
waves
in
every
direction
every
boat
and
every
article
which
could
serve
as
a
boat
was
eagerly
seized
upon
every
house
was
inundated
even
the
graveyards
gave
up
their
dead
the
living
infant
in
his
cradle
and
the
corpse
in
his
coffin
floated
side
by
side
the
ancient
flood
seemed
about
to
be
renewed
everywhere
upon
the
tops
of
trees
upon
the
steeples
of
churches
human
beings
were
clustered
praying
to
god
for
mercy
and
to
their
fellow
men
for
assistance
as
the
storm
at
last
was
subsiding
boats
began
to
ply
in
every
direction
saving
those
who
were
struggling
in
the
water
picking
fugitives
from
roofs
and
treetops
and
collecting
the
bodies
of
those
already
no
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
human
beings
had
perished
in
a
few
hours
thousands
upon
thousands
of
dumb
creatures
lay
dead
upon
the
waters
and
the
damage
to
property
was
beyond
calculation
robles
the
spanish
governor
was
foremost
in
noble
efforts
to
save
life
and
lessen
the
horrors
of
the
catastrophe
he
had
previously
been
hated
by
the
dutch
because
of
his
spanish
or
portuguese
blood
but
by
his
goodness
and
activity
in
their
hour
of
disaster
he
won
all
hearts
to
gratitude
he
soon
introduced
an
improved
method
of
constructing
the
dikes
and
passed
a
law
that
they
should
in
future
be
kept
up
by
the
owners
of
the
soil
there
were
fewer
heavy
floods
from
this
time
though
within
less
than
three
hundred
years
six
fearful
inundations
swept
over
the
land
in
the
spring
there
is
always
great
danger
of
inland
freshets
especially
in
times
of
thaw
because
the
rivers
choked
with
blocks
of
ice
overflow
before
they
can
discharge
their
rapidly
rising
waters
into
the
ocean
adding
to
this
that
the
sea
chafes
and
presses
against
the
dikes
it
is
no
wonder
that
holland
is
often
in
a
state
of
alarm
the
greatest
care
is
taken
to
prevent
accidents
engineers
and
workmen
are
stationed
all
along
in
threatened
places
and
a
close
watch
is
kept
up
night
and
day
when
a
general
signal
of
danger
is
given
the
inhabitants
all
rush
to
the
rescue
eager
to
combine
against
their
common
foe
as
everywhere
else
straw
is
supposed
to
be
of
all
things
the
most
helpless
in
the
water
of
course
in
holland
it
must
be
rendered
the
mainstay
against
a
rushing
tide
huge
straw
mats
are
pressed
against
the
embankments
fortified
with
clay
and
heavy
stone
and
once
adjusted
the
ocean
dashes
against
them
in
vain
raff
brinker
the
father
of
gretel
and
hans
had
for
years
been
employed
upon
the
dikes
it
was
at
the
time
of
a
threatened
inundation
when
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
storm
in
darkness
and
sleet
the
men
were
laboring
at
a
weak
spot
near
the
veermyk
sluice
that
he
fell
from
the
scaffolding
and
became
insensible
from
that
hour
he
never
worked
again
though
he
lived
on
mind
and
memory
were
gone
gretel
could
not
remember
him
otherwise
than
as
the
strange
silent
man
whose
eyes
followed
her
vacantly
whichever
way
she
turned
but
hans
had
recollections
of
a
hearty
father
who
was
never
tired
of
bearing
him
upon
his
shoulder
and
whose
careless
song
still
seemed
echoing
near
when
he
lay
awake
at
night
and
listened
the
silver
skates
dame
brinker
earned
a
scant
support
for
her
family
by
raising
vegetables
spinning
and
knitting
once
she
had
worked
on
board
the
barges
plying
up
and
down
the
canal
and
had
occasionally
been
harnessed
with
other
women
to
the
towing
rope
of
a
pakschuyt
plying
between
broek
and
amsterdam
but
when
hans
had
grown
strong
and
large
he
had
insisted
on
doing
all
such
drudgery
in
her
place
besides
her
husband
had
become
so
very
helpless
of
late
that
he
required
her
constant
care
although
not
having
as
much
intelligence
as
a
little
child
he
was
yet
strong
of
arm
and
very
hearty
and
dame
brinker
had
sometimes
great
trouble
in
controlling
him
ah
children
he
was
so
good
and
steady
she
would
sometimes
say
and
as
wise
as
a
lawyer
even
the
burgomaster
would
stop
to
ask
him
a
question
and
now
alack
he
doesn
t
know
his
wife
and
little
ones
you
remember
the
father
hans
when
he
was
himself
a
great
brave
man
don
t
you
yes
indeed
mother
he
knew
everything
and
could
do
anything
under
the
sun
and
how
he
would
sing
why
you
used
to
laugh
and
say
it
was
enough
to
set
the
windmills
so
i
did
bless
me
how
the
boy
remembers
gretel
child
take
that
knitting
needle
from
your
father
quick
he
ll
get
it
in
his
eyes
maybe
and
put
the
shoe
on
him
his
poor
feet
are
like
ice
half
the
time
but
i
can
t
keep
em
covered
all
i
can
do
and
then
half
wailing
half
humming
dame
brinker
would
sit
down
and
fill
the
low
cottage
with
the
whirr
of
her
spinning
wheel
nearly
all
the
outdoor
work
as
well
as
the
household
labor
was
performed
by
hans
and
gretel
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
the
children
went
out
day
after
day
to
gather
peat
which
they
would
stow
away
in
square
bricklike
pieces
for
fuel
at
other
times
when
homework
permitted
hans
rode
the
on
the
canals
earning
a
few
stivers
a
stiver
is
worth
about
two
cents
of
our
money
a
day
and
gretel
tended
geese
for
the
neighboring
farmers
hans
was
clever
at
carving
in
wood
and
both
he
and
gretel
were
good
gardeners
gretel
could
sing
and
sew
and
run
on
great
high
homemade
stilts
better
than
any
other
girl
for
miles
around
she
could
learn
a
ballad
in
five
minutes
and
find
in
its
season
any
weed
or
flower
you
could
name
but
she
dreaded
books
and
often
the
very
sight
of
the
figuring
board
in
the
old
schoolhouse
would
set
her
eyes
swimming
hans
on
the
contrary
was
slow
and
steady
the
harder
the
task
whether
in
study
or
daily
labor
the
better
he
liked
it
boys
who
sneered
at
him
out
of
school
on
account
of
his
patched
clothes
and
scant
leather
breeches
were
forced
to
yield
him
the
post
of
honor
in
nearly
every
class
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
the
only
youngster
in
the
school
who
had
not
stood
at
least
once
in
the
corner
of
horrors
where
hung
a
dreaded
whip
and
over
it
this
motto
leer
leer
jou
luigaart
of
dit
endje
touw
zal
je
leeren
learn
learn
you
idler
or
this
rope
s
end
shall
teach
you
it
was
only
in
winter
that
gretel
and
hans
could
be
spared
to
attend
school
and
for
the
past
month
they
had
been
kept
at
home
because
their
mother
needed
their
services
raff
brinker
required
constant
attention
and
there
was
black
bread
to
be
made
and
the
house
to
be
kept
clean
and
stockings
and
other
things
to
be
knitted
and
sold
in
the
marketplace
while
they
were
busily
assisting
their
mother
on
this
cold
december
morning
a
merry
troop
of
girls
and
boys
came
skimming
down
the
canal
there
were
fine
skaters
among
them
and
as
the
bright
medley
of
costumes
flitted
by
it
looked
from
a
distance
as
though
the
ice
had
suddenly
thawed
and
some
gay
tulip
bed
were
floating
along
on
the
current
there
was
the
rich
burgomaster
s
daughter
hilda
van
gleck
with
her
costly
furs
and
velvet
sack
and
nearby
a
pretty
peasant
girl
annie
bouman
jauntily
attired
in
a
coarse
scarlet
jacket
and
a
blue
skirt
just
short
enough
to
display
the
gray
homespun
hose
to
advantage
then
there
was
the
proud
rychie
korbes
whose
father
mynheer
van
korbes
was
one
of
the
leading
men
of
amsterdam
and
flocking
closely
around
her
carl
schummel
peter
and
ludwig
van
holp
jacob
poot
and
a
very
small
boy
rejoicing
in
the
tremendous
name
of
voostenwalbert
schimmelpenninck
there
were
nearly
twenty
other
boys
and
girls
in
the
party
and
one
and
all
seemed
full
of
excitement
and
frolic
up
and
down
the
canal
within
the
space
of
a
half
mile
they
skated
exerting
their
racing
powers
to
the
utmost
often
the
swiftest
among
them
was
seen
to
dodge
from
under
the
very
nose
of
some
pompous
lawgiver
or
doctor
who
with
folded
arms
was
skating
leisurely
toward
the
town
or
a
chain
of
girls
would
suddenly
break
at
the
approach
of
a
fat
old
burgomaster
who
with
cane
poised
in
air
was
puffing
his
way
to
amsterdam
equipped
in
skates
wonderful
to
behold
with
their
superb
strappings
and
dazzling
runners
curving
over
the
instep
and
topped
with
gilt
balls
he
would
open
his
fat
eyes
a
little
if
one
of
the
maidens
chanced
to
drop
him
a
curtsy
but
would
not
dare
to
bow
in
return
for
fear
of
losing
his
balance
not
only
pleasure
seekers
and
stately
men
of
note
were
upon
the
canal
there
were
workpeople
with
weary
eyes
hastening
to
their
shops
and
factories
market
women
with
loads
upon
their
heads
peddlers
bending
with
their
packs
bargemen
with
shaggy
hair
and
bleared
faces
jostling
roughly
on
their
way
clergymen
speeding
perhaps
to
the
bedsides
of
the
dying
and
after
a
while
groups
of
children
with
satchels
slung
over
their
shoulders
whizzing
past
toward
the
distant
school
one
and
all
wore
skates
except
indeed
a
farmer
whose
queer
cart
bumped
along
on
the
margin
of
the
canal
before
long
our
merry
boys
and
girls
were
almost
lost
in
the
confusion
of
bright
colors
the
ceaseless
motion
and
the
gleaming
of
skates
flashing
back
the
sunlight
we
might
have
known
no
more
of
them
had
not
the
whole
party
suddenly
come
to
a
standstill
and
grouping
themselves
out
of
the
way
of
the
passersby
all
talked
at
once
to
a
pretty
little
maiden
whom
they
had
drawn
from
the
tide
of
people
flowing
toward
the
town
oh
katrinka
they
cried
in
one
breath
have
you
heard
of
it
the
race
we
want
you
to
join
what
race
asked
katrinka
laughing
don
t
all
talk
at
once
please
i
can
t
everyone
panted
and
looked
at
rychie
korbes
who
was
their
acknowledged
spokeswoman
why
said
rychie
we
are
to
have
a
grand
skating
match
on
the
twentieth
on
mevrouw
van
gleck
s
birthday
it
s
all
hilda
s
work
they
are
going
to
give
a
splendid
prize
to
the
best
yes
chimed
in
half
a
dozen
voices
a
beautiful
pair
of
silver
skates
perfectly
magnificent
with
oh
such
straps
and
silver
bells
and
buckles
who
said
they
had
bells
put
in
a
small
voice
of
the
boy
with
the
big
name
i
say
so
master
voost
replied
rychie
so
they
have
no
i
m
sure
they
haven
t
oh
how
can
you
say
so
it
s
an
arrow
and
mynheer
van
korbes
told
my
mother
they
had
bells
came
from
the
excited
group
but
mynheer
voostenwalbert
schimmelpenninck
essayed
to
settle
the
matter
with
a
decisive
well
you
don
t
any
of
you
know
a
single
thing
about
it
they
haven
t
a
sign
of
a
bell
on
them
they
oh
oh
and
the
chorus
of
conflicting
opinions
broke
forth
again
the
girls
pair
is
to
have
bells
interposed
hilda
quietly
but
there
is
to
be
another
pair
for
the
boys
with
an
arrow
engraved
upon
the
there
i
told
you
so
cried
nearly
all
the
youngsters
in
one
breath
katrinka
looked
at
them
with
bewildered
eyes
who
is
to
try
she
asked
all
of
us
answered
rychie
it
will
be
such
fun
and
you
must
too
katrinka
but
it
s
schooltime
now
we
will
talk
it
all
over
at
noon
oh
you
will
join
of
katrinka
without
replying
made
a
graceful
pirouette
and
laughing
out
a
coquettish
don
t
you
hear
the
last
bell
catch
me
darted
off
toward
the
schoolhouse
standing
half
a
mile
away
on
the
canal
all
started
at
this
challenge
but
they
tried
in
vain
to
catch
the
laughing
creature
who
with
golden
hair
streaming
in
the
sunlight
cast
back
many
a
sparkling
glance
of
triumph
as
she
floated
onward
beautiful
katrinka
flushed
with
youth
and
health
all
life
and
mirth
and
motion
what
wonder
thine
image
ever
floating
in
advance
sped
through
one
boy
s
dreams
that
night
what
wonder
that
it
seemed
his
darkest
hour
when
years
afterward
thy
presence
floated
away
from
him
forever
hans
and
gretel
find
a
friend
at
noon
our
young
friends
poured
forth
from
the
schoolhouse
intent
upon
having
an
hour
s
practice
upon
the
canal
they
had
skated
but
a
few
moments
when
carl
schummel
said
mockingly
to
hilda
there
s
a
pretty
pair
just
coming
upon
the
ice
the
little
ragpickers
their
skates
must
have
been
a
present
from
the
king
they
are
patient
creatures
said
hilda
gently
it
must
have
been
hard
to
learn
to
skate
upon
such
queer
affairs
they
are
very
poor
peasants
you
see
the
boy
has
probably
made
the
skates
carl
was
somewhat
abashed
patient
they
may
be
but
as
for
skating
they
start
off
pretty
well
only
to
finish
with
a
jerk
they
could
move
well
to
your
new
staccato
piece
i
hilda
laughed
pleasantly
and
left
him
after
joining
a
small
detachment
of
the
racers
and
sailing
past
every
one
of
them
she
halted
beside
gretel
who
with
eager
eyes
had
been
watching
the
sport
what
is
your
name
little
girl
gretel
my
lady
answered
the
child
somewhat
awed
by
hilda
s
rank
though
they
were
nearly
of
the
same
age
and
my
brother
is
called
hans
is
a
stout
fellow
said
hilda
cheerily
and
seems
to
have
a
warm
stove
somewhere
within
him
but
you
look
cold
you
should
wear
more
clothing
little
gretel
who
had
nothing
else
to
wear
tried
to
laugh
as
she
answered
i
am
not
so
very
little
i
am
past
twelve
years
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
you
see
i
am
nearly
fourteen
and
so
large
for
my
age
that
other
girls
seem
small
to
me
but
that
is
nothing
perhaps
you
will
shoot
up
far
above
me
yet
but
not
unless
you
dress
more
warmly
though
shivering
girls
never
hans
flushed
as
he
saw
tears
rising
in
gretel
s
eyes
my
sister
has
not
complained
of
the
cold
but
this
is
bitter
weather
they
all
and
he
looked
sadly
upon
gretel
it
is
nothing
said
gretel
i
am
often
warm
too
warm
when
i
am
skating
you
are
good
jufvrouw
miss
young
lady
pronounced
yuffrow
in
studied
or
polite
address
it
would
be
jongvrowe
pronounced
youngfrow
to
think
of
no
no
answered
hilda
quite
angry
at
herself
i
am
careless
cruel
but
i
meant
no
harm
i
wanted
to
ask
you
i
mean
if
and
here
hilda
coming
to
the
point
of
her
errand
faltered
before
the
poorly
clad
but
children
she
wished
to
serve
what
is
it
young
lady
exclaimed
hans
eagerly
if
there
is
any
service
i
can
do
any
oh
no
no
laughed
hilda
shaking
off
her
embarrassment
i
only
wished
to
speak
to
you
about
the
grand
race
why
do
you
not
join
it
you
both
can
skate
well
and
the
ranks
are
free
anyone
may
enter
for
the
gretel
looked
wistfully
at
hans
who
tugging
at
his
cap
answered
respectfully
ah
jufvrouw
even
if
we
could
enter
we
could
skate
only
a
few
strokes
with
the
rest
our
skates
are
hard
wood
you
see
holding
up
the
sole
of
his
foot
but
they
soon
become
damp
and
then
they
stick
and
trip
gretel
s
eyes
twinkled
with
fun
as
she
thought
of
hans
s
mishap
in
the
morning
but
she
blushed
as
she
faltered
out
timidly
oh
no
we
can
t
join
but
may
we
be
there
my
lady
on
the
great
day
to
look
on
certainly
answered
hilda
looking
kindly
into
the
two
earnest
faces
and
wishing
from
her
heart
that
she
had
not
spent
so
much
of
her
monthly
allowance
for
lace
and
finery
she
had
but
eight
kwartjes
a
kwartje
is
a
small
silver
coin
worth
of
a
guilder
or
ten
cents
in
american
currency
left
and
they
would
buy
but
one
pair
of
skates
at
the
furthest
looking
down
with
a
sigh
at
the
two
pairs
of
feet
so
very
different
in
size
she
asked
which
of
you
is
the
better
skater
gretel
replied
hans
promptly
hans
answered
gretel
in
the
same
breath
hilda
smiled
i
can
not
buy
you
each
a
pair
of
skates
or
even
one
good
pair
but
here
are
eight
kwartjes
decide
between
you
which
stands
the
best
chance
of
winning
the
race
and
buy
the
skates
accordingly
i
wish
i
had
enough
to
buy
better
ones
and
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
hilda
after
handing
the
money
to
the
electrified
hans
glided
swiftly
away
to
rejoin
her
companions
jufvrouw
jufvrouw
van
gleck
called
hans
in
a
loud
tone
stumbling
after
her
as
well
as
he
could
for
one
of
his
skate
strings
was
untied
hilda
turned
and
with
one
hand
raised
to
shield
her
eyes
from
the
sun
seemed
to
him
to
be
floating
through
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
we
can
not
take
this
money
panted
hans
though
we
know
your
goodness
in
giving
why
not
indeed
asked
hilda
flushing
because
replied
hans
bowing
like
a
clown
but
looking
with
the
eye
of
a
prince
at
the
queenly
girl
we
have
not
earned
hilda
was
she
had
noticed
a
pretty
wooden
chain
upon
gretel
s
neck
carve
me
a
chain
hans
like
the
one
your
sister
that
i
will
lady
with
all
my
heart
we
have
whitewood
in
the
house
fine
as
ivory
you
shall
have
one
and
hans
hastily
tried
to
return
the
money
no
no
said
hilda
decidedly
that
sum
will
be
but
a
poor
price
for
the
and
off
she
darted
outstripping
the
fleetest
among
the
skaters
hans
sent
a
long
bewildered
gaze
after
her
it
was
useless
he
felt
to
make
any
further
resistance
it
is
right
he
muttered
half
to
himself
half
to
his
faithful
shadow
gretel
i
must
work
hard
every
minute
and
sit
up
half
the
night
if
the
mother
will
let
me
burn
a
candle
but
the
chain
shall
be
finished
we
may
keep
the
money
what
a
good
little
lady
cried
gretel
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
oh
hans
was
it
for
nothing
the
stork
settled
on
our
roof
last
summer
do
you
remember
how
the
mother
said
it
would
bring
us
luck
and
how
she
cried
when
janzoon
kolp
shot
him
and
she
set
it
would
bring
him
trouble
but
the
luck
has
come
to
us
at
last
now
hans
if
the
mother
sends
us
to
town
tomorrow
you
can
buy
the
skates
in
the
hans
shook
his
head
the
young
lady
would
have
given
us
the
money
to
buy
skates
but
if
i
earn
it
gretel
it
shall
be
spent
for
wool
you
must
have
a
warm
oh
cried
gretel
in
real
dismay
not
buy
the
skates
why
i
am
not
often
cold
mother
says
the
blood
runs
up
and
down
in
poor
children
s
veins
humming
i
must
keep
em
warm
i
must
keep
em
oh
hans
she
continued
with
something
like
a
sob
don
t
say
you
won
t
buy
the
skates
it
makes
me
feel
just
like
crying
besides
i
want
to
be
cold
i
mean
i
m
real
awful
warm
so
now
hans
looked
up
hurriedly
he
had
a
true
dutch
horror
or
tears
or
emotion
of
any
kind
and
most
of
all
he
dreaded
to
see
his
sisters
blue
eyes
overflowing
now
mind
cried
gretel
seeing
her
advantage
i
ll
feel
awful
if
you
give
up
the
skates
i
don
t
want
them
i
m
not
so
stingy
as
that
but
i
want
you
to
have
them
and
then
when
i
get
bigger
they
ll
do
for
me
oh
count
the
pieces
hans
did
you
ever
see
so
many
hans
turned
the
money
thoughtfully
in
his
palm
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
longed
so
intensely
for
a
pair
of
skates
for
he
had
known
of
the
race
and
had
fairly
ached
for
a
chance
to
test
his
powers
with
the
other
children
he
felt
confident
that
with
a
good
pair
of
steel
runners
he
could
readily
outdistance
most
of
the
boys
on
the
canal
then
too
gretel
s
argument
was
plausible
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
that
she
with
her
strong
but
lithe
little
frame
needed
but
a
week
s
practice
on
good
runners
to
make
her
a
better
skater
than
rychie
korbes
or
even
katrinka
flack
as
soon
as
this
last
thought
flashed
upon
him
his
resolve
was
made
if
gretel
would
not
have
the
jacket
she
should
have
the
skates
no
gretel
he
answered
at
last
i
can
wait
someday
i
may
have
money
enough
saved
to
buy
a
fine
pair
you
shall
have
gretel
s
eyes
sparkled
but
in
another
instant
she
insisted
rather
faintly
the
young
lady
gave
the
money
to
you
hans
i
d
be
real
bad
to
take
hans
shook
his
head
resolutely
as
he
trudged
on
causing
his
sister
to
half
skip
and
half
walk
in
her
effort
to
keep
beside
him
by
this
time
they
had
taken
off
their
wooden
rockers
and
were
hastening
home
to
tell
their
mother
the
good
news
oh
i
know
cried
gretel
in
a
sprightly
tone
you
can
do
this
you
can
get
a
pair
a
little
too
small
for
you
and
too
big
for
me
and
we
can
take
turns
and
use
them
won
t
that
be
fine
gretel
clapped
her
hands
again
poor
hans
this
was
a
strong
temptation
but
he
pushed
it
away
from
him
fellow
that
he
was
nonsense
gretel
you
could
never
get
on
with
a
big
pair
you
stumbled
about
with
these
like
a
blind
chicken
before
i
curved
off
the
ends
no
you
must
have
a
pair
to
fit
exactly
and
you
must
practice
every
chance
you
can
get
until
the
twentieth
comes
my
little
gretel
shall
win
the
silver
gretel
could
not
help
laughing
with
delight
at
the
very
idea
hans
gretel
called
out
a
familiar
voice
coming
mother
they
hastened
toward
the
cottage
hans
still
shaking
the
pieces
of
silver
in
his
hand
on
the
following
day
there
was
not
a
prouder
nor
a
happier
boy
in
all
holland
than
hans
brinker
as
he
watched
his
sister
with
many
a
dexterous
sweep
flying
in
and
out
among
the
skaters
who
at
sundown
thronged
the
canal
a
warm
jacket
had
been
given
her
by
the
hilda
and
the
shoes
had
been
cobbled
into
decency
by
dame
brinker
as
the
little
creature
darted
backward
and
forward
flushed
with
enjoyment
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
many
wondering
glances
bent
upon
her
she
felt
that
the
shining
runners
beneath
her
feet
had
suddenly
turned
earth
into
fairyland
while
hans
dear
good
hans
echoed
itself
over
and
over
again
in
her
grateful
heart
by
den
donder
exclaimed
peter
van
holp
to
carl
schummel
but
that
little
one
in
the
red
jacket
and
patched
petticoat
skates
well
gunst
she
has
toes
on
her
heels
and
eyes
in
the
back
of
her
head
see
her
it
will
be
a
joke
if
she
gets
in
the
race
and
beats
katrinka
flack
after
hush
not
so
loud
returned
carl
rather
sneeringly
that
little
lady
in
rags
is
the
special
pet
of
hilda
van
gleck
those
shining
skates
are
her
gift
if
i
make
no
so
so
exclaimed
peter
with
a
radiant
smile
for
hilda
was
his
best
friend
she
has
been
at
her
good
work
there
too
and
mynheer
van
holp
after
cutting
a
double
figure
eight
on
the
ice
to
say
nothing
of
a
huge
p
then
a
jump
and
an
h
glided
onward
until
he
found
himself
beside
hilda
hand
in
hand
they
skated
together
laughingly
at
first
then
staidly
talking
in
a
low
tone
strange
to
say
peter
van
holp
soon
arrived
at
a
sudden
conviction
that
his
little
sister
needed
a
wooden
chain
just
like
hilda
s
two
days
afterwards
on
saint
nicholas
s
eve
hans
having
burned
three
candle
ends
and
cut
his
thumb
into
the
bargain
stood
in
the
marketplace
at
amsterdam
buying
another
pair
of
skates
shadows
in
the
home
good
dame
brinker
as
soon
as
the
scanty
dinner
had
been
cleared
away
that
noon
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
her
holiday
attire
in
honor
of
saint
nicholas
it
will
brighten
the
children
she
thought
to
herself
and
she
was
not
mistaken
this
festival
dress
had
been
worn
very
seldom
during
the
past
ten
years
before
that
time
it
had
done
good
service
and
had
flourished
at
many
a
dance
and
kermis
when
she
was
known
far
and
wide
as
the
pretty
meitje
klenck
the
children
had
sometimes
been
granted
rare
glimpses
of
it
as
it
lay
in
state
in
the
old
oaken
chest
faded
and
threadbare
as
it
was
it
was
gorgeous
in
their
eyes
with
its
white
linen
tucker
now
gathered
to
her
plump
throat
and
vanishing
beneath
the
trim
bodice
of
blue
homespun
and
its
skirt
bordered
with
black
the
knitted
woolen
mitts
and
the
dainty
cap
showing
her
hair
which
generally
was
hidden
made
her
seem
almost
like
a
princess
to
gretel
while
master
hans
grew
staid
and
as
he
gazed
soon
the
little
maid
while
braiding
her
own
golden
tresses
fairly
danced
around
her
mother
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
oh
mother
mother
mother
how
pretty
you
are
look
hans
isn
t
it
just
like
a
picture
just
like
a
picture
assented
hans
cheerfully
just
like
a
picture
only
i
don
t
like
those
stocking
things
on
the
not
like
the
mitts
brother
hans
why
they
re
very
important
see
they
cover
up
all
the
red
oh
mother
how
white
your
arm
is
where
the
mitt
leaves
off
whiter
than
mine
oh
ever
so
much
whiter
i
declare
mother
the
bodice
is
tight
for
you
you
re
growing
you
re
surely
growing
dame
brinker
laughed
this
was
made
long
ago
lovey
when
i
wasn
t
much
thicker
about
the
waist
than
a
churn
dasher
and
how
do
you
like
the
cap
she
asked
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
oh
ever
so
much
mother
it
s
see
the
father
is
looking
was
the
father
looking
alas
only
with
a
dull
stare
his
vrouw
turned
toward
him
with
a
start
something
like
a
blush
rising
to
her
cheeks
a
questioning
sparkle
in
her
eye
the
bright
look
died
away
in
an
instant
no
she
sighed
he
sees
nothing
come
hans
and
the
smile
crept
faintly
back
again
don
t
stand
gaping
at
me
all
day
and
the
new
skates
waiting
for
you
at
ah
mother
he
answered
you
need
so
many
things
why
should
i
buy
skates
nonsense
child
the
money
was
given
to
you
on
purpose
or
the
work
was
it
s
all
the
same
thing
go
while
the
sun
is
yes
and
hurry
back
hans
laughed
gretel
we
ll
race
on
the
canal
tonight
if
the
mother
lets
at
the
very
threshold
he
turned
to
say
your
spinning
wheel
wants
a
new
treadle
you
can
make
it
so
i
can
that
will
take
no
money
but
you
need
feathers
and
wool
and
meal
and
there
there
that
will
do
your
silver
can
not
buy
everything
ah
hans
if
our
stolen
money
would
but
come
back
on
this
bright
saint
nicholas
s
eve
how
glad
we
would
be
only
last
night
i
prayed
to
the
good
saint
mother
interrupted
hans
in
dismay
why
not
hans
shame
on
you
to
reproach
me
for
that
i
m
as
true
a
protestant
in
sooth
as
any
fine
lady
that
walks
into
church
but
it
s
no
wrong
to
turn
sometimes
to
the
good
saint
nicholas
tut
it
s
a
likely
story
if
one
can
t
do
that
without
one
s
children
flaring
up
at
it
and
he
the
boys
and
girls
own
saint
hoot
mayhap
the
colt
is
a
steadier
horse
than
the
mare
hans
knew
his
mother
too
well
to
offer
a
word
in
opposition
when
her
voice
quickened
and
sharpened
as
it
did
now
it
was
often
sharp
and
quick
when
she
spoke
of
the
missing
money
so
he
said
gently
and
what
did
you
ask
of
good
saint
nicholas
mother
why
never
to
give
the
thieves
a
wink
of
sleep
till
they
brought
it
back
to
be
sure
if
he
has
the
power
to
do
such
things
or
else
to
brighten
our
wits
that
we
might
find
it
ourselves
not
a
sight
have
i
had
of
it
since
the
day
before
the
dear
father
was
hurt
as
you
well
know
that
i
do
mother
he
answered
sadly
though
you
have
almost
pulled
down
the
cottage
in
aye
but
it
was
of
no
use
moaned
the
dame
hiders
make
best
hans
started
do
you
think
the
father
could
tell
aught
aye
indeed
said
dame
brinker
nodding
her
head
i
think
so
but
that
is
no
sign
i
never
hold
the
same
belief
in
the
matter
two
days
mayhap
the
father
paid
it
off
for
the
great
silver
watch
we
have
been
guarding
since
that
day
but
no
i
ll
never
believe
the
watch
was
not
worth
a
quarter
of
the
money
no
indeed
and
your
father
was
a
shrewd
man
up
to
the
last
moment
he
was
too
steady
and
thrifty
for
silly
where
did
the
watch
come
from
i
wonder
muttered
hans
half
to
himself
dame
brinker
shook
her
head
and
looked
sadly
toward
her
husband
who
sat
staring
blankly
at
the
floor
gretel
stood
near
him
knitting
that
we
shall
never
know
hans
i
have
shown
it
to
the
father
many
a
time
but
he
does
not
know
it
from
a
potato
when
he
came
in
that
dreadful
night
to
supper
he
handed
the
watch
to
me
and
told
me
to
take
good
care
of
it
until
he
asked
for
it
again
just
as
he
opened
his
lips
to
say
more
broom
klatterboost
came
flying
in
with
word
that
the
dike
was
in
danger
ah
the
waters
were
terrible
that
my
man
alack
caught
up
his
tools
and
ran
out
that
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
him
in
his
right
mind
he
was
brought
in
again
by
midnight
nearly
dead
with
his
poor
head
all
bruised
and
cut
the
fever
passed
off
in
time
but
never
the
dullness
that
grew
worse
every
day
we
shall
never
hans
had
heard
all
this
before
more
than
once
he
had
seen
his
mother
in
hours
of
sore
need
take
the
watch
from
its
hiding
place
half
resolved
to
sell
it
but
she
had
always
conquered
the
temptation
no
hans
she
would
say
we
must
be
nearer
starvation
than
this
before
we
turn
faithless
to
the
father
a
memory
of
some
such
scene
crossed
her
son
s
mind
now
for
after
giving
a
heavy
sigh
and
flipping
a
crumb
of
wax
at
gretel
across
the
table
he
said
aye
mother
you
have
done
bravely
to
keep
it
many
a
one
would
have
tossed
it
off
for
gold
long
and
more
shame
for
them
exclaimed
the
dame
indignantly
i
would
not
do
it
besides
the
gentry
are
so
hard
on
us
poor
folks
that
if
they
saw
such
a
thing
in
our
hands
even
if
we
told
all
they
might
suspect
the
father
of
hans
flushed
angrily
they
would
not
dare
to
say
such
a
thing
mother
if
they
did
i
d
he
clenched
his
fist
and
seemed
to
think
that
the
rest
of
his
sentence
was
too
terrible
to
utter
in
her
presence
dame
brinker
smiled
proudly
through
her
tears
at
this
interruption
ah
hans
thou
rt
a
true
brave
lad
we
will
never
part
company
with
the
watch
in
his
dying
hour
the
dear
father
might
wake
and
ask
for
might
wake
mother
echoed
hans
wake
and
know
us
aye
child
almost
whispered
his
mother
such
things
have
by
this
time
hans
had
nearly
forgotten
his
proposed
errand
to
amsterdam
his
mother
had
seldom
spoken
so
familiarly
to
him
he
felt
himself
now
to
be
not
only
her
son
but
her
friend
her
adviser
you
are
right
mother
we
must
never
give
up
the
watch
for
the
father
s
sake
we
will
guard
it
always
the
money
though
may
come
to
light
when
we
least
expect
never
cried
dame
brinker
taking
the
last
stitch
from
her
needle
with
a
jerk
and
laying
the
unfinished
knitting
heavily
upon
her
lap
there
is
no
chance
one
thousand
guilders
and
all
gone
in
a
day
one
thousand
guilders
oh
what
ever
did
become
of
them
if
they
went
in
an
evil
way
the
thief
would
have
confessed
it
on
his
dying
bed
he
would
not
dare
to
die
with
such
guilt
on
his
soul
he
may
not
be
dead
yet
said
hans
soothingly
any
day
we
may
hear
of
ah
child
she
said
in
a
changed
tone
what
thief
would
ever
have
come
here
it
was
always
neat
and
clean
thank
god
but
not
fine
for
the
father
and
i
saved
and
saved
that
we
might
have
something
laid
by
little
and
often
soon
fills
the
we
found
it
so
in
truth
besides
the
father
had
a
goodly
sum
already
for
service
done
to
the
heernocht
lands
at
the
time
of
the
great
inundation
every
week
we
had
a
guilder
left
over
sometimes
more
for
the
father
worked
extra
hours
and
could
get
high
pay
for
his
labor
every
saturday
night
we
put
something
by
except
the
time
when
you
had
the
fever
hans
and
when
gretel
came
at
last
the
pouch
grew
so
full
that
i
mended
an
old
stocking
and
commenced
again
now
that
i
look
back
it
seems
that
the
money
was
up
to
the
heel
in
a
few
sunny
weeks
there
was
great
pay
in
those
days
if
a
man
was
quick
at
engineer
work
the
stocking
went
on
filling
with
copper
and
silver
aye
and
gold
you
may
well
open
your
eyes
gretel
i
used
to
laugh
and
tell
the
father
it
was
not
for
poverty
i
wore
my
old
gown
and
the
stocking
went
on
filling
so
full
that
sometimes
when
i
woke
at
night
i
d
get
up
soft
and
quiet
and
go
feel
it
in
the
moonlight
then
on
my
knees
i
would
thank
our
lord
that
my
little
ones
could
in
time
get
good
learning
and
that
the
father
might
rest
from
labor
in
his
old
age
sometimes
at
supper
the
father
and
i
would
talk
about
a
new
chimney
and
a
good
winter
room
for
the
cow
but
my
man
had
finer
plans
even
than
that
a
big
sail
says
he
catches
the
wind
we
can
do
what
we
will
soon
and
then
we
would
sing
together
as
i
washed
my
dishes
ah
a
smooth
wind
makes
an
easy
not
a
thing
vexed
me
from
morning
till
night
every
week
the
father
would
take
out
the
stocking
and
drop
in
the
money
and
laugh
and
kiss
me
as
we
tied
it
up
together
up
with
you
hans
there
you
sit
gaping
and
the
day
added
dame
brinker
tartly
blushing
to
find
that
she
had
been
speaking
too
freely
to
her
boy
it
s
high
time
you
were
on
your
hans
had
seated
himself
and
was
looking
earnestly
into
her
face
he
arose
and
in
almost
a
whisper
asked
have
you
ever
tried
mother
she
understood
him
yes
child
often
but
the
father
only
laughs
or
he
stares
at
me
so
strange
that
i
am
glad
to
ask
no
more
when
you
and
gretel
had
the
fever
last
winter
and
our
bread
was
nearly
gone
and
i
could
earn
nothing
for
fear
you
would
die
while
my
face
was
turned
oh
i
tried
then
i
smoothed
his
hair
and
whispered
to
him
soft
as
a
kitten
about
the
money
where
it
was
who
had
it
alack
he
would
pick
at
my
sleeve
and
whisper
gibberish
till
my
blood
ran
cold
at
last
while
gretel
lay
whiter
than
snow
and
you
were
raving
on
the
bed
i
screamed
to
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
hear
me
raff
where
is
our
money
do
you
know
aught
of
the
money
raff
the
money
in
the
pouch
and
the
stocking
in
the
big
chest
but
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
a
stone
i
might
as
the
mother
s
voice
sounded
so
strange
and
her
eye
was
so
bright
that
hans
with
a
new
anxiety
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
come
mother
he
said
let
us
try
to
forget
this
money
i
am
big
and
strong
gretel
too
is
very
quick
and
willing
soon
all
will
be
prosperous
with
us
again
why
mother
gretel
and
i
would
rather
see
thee
bright
and
happy
than
to
have
all
the
silver
in
the
world
wouldn
t
we
gretel
the
mother
knows
it
said
gretel
sobbing
sunbeams
dame
brinker
was
startled
at
her
children
s
emotion
glad
too
for
it
proved
how
loving
and
true
they
were
beautiful
ladies
in
princely
homes
often
smile
suddenly
and
sweetly
gladdening
the
very
air
around
them
but
i
doubt
if
their
smile
be
more
welcome
in
god
s
sight
than
that
which
sprang
forth
to
cheer
the
roughly
clad
boy
and
girl
in
the
humble
cottage
dame
brinker
felt
that
she
had
been
selfish
blushing
and
brightening
she
hastily
wiped
her
eyes
and
looked
upon
them
as
only
a
mother
can
hoity
toity
pretty
talk
we
re
having
and
saint
nicholas
s
eve
almost
here
what
wonder
the
yarn
pricks
my
fingers
come
gretel
take
this
cent
the
dutch
cent
is
worth
less
than
half
of
an
american
cent
and
while
hans
is
trading
for
the
skates
you
can
buy
a
waffle
in
the
let
me
stay
home
with
you
mother
said
gretel
looking
up
with
eyes
that
sparkled
through
their
tears
hans
will
buy
me
the
as
you
will
child
and
hans
wait
a
moment
three
turns
of
this
needle
will
finish
this
toe
and
then
you
may
have
as
good
a
pair
of
hose
as
ever
were
knitted
owning
the
yarn
is
a
grain
too
sharp
to
sell
to
the
hosier
on
the
harengracht
a
street
in
amsterdam
that
will
give
us
three
if
you
make
good
trade
and
as
it
s
right
hungry
weather
you
may
buy
four
waffles

ll
keep
the
feast
of
saint
nicholas
after
gretel
clapped
her
hands
that
will
be
fine
annie
bouman

me
what
grand
times
they
will
have
in
the
big
houses

but

beautiful
new
skates
and
then

waffles
oh

t
break
them
brother
hans

them
well
and
button

under
your
jacket

certainly
replied
hans
quite
gruff
with
pleasure
and
importance
oh
mother
cried
gretel
in
high
glee
soon
you
will
be
busied
with
the
father
and
now
you
are
only
knitting
do
tell
us
all
about
saint
nicholas
dame
brinker
laughed
to
see
hans
hang
up
his
hat
and
prepare
to
listen
nonsense
children
she
said
i
have
told
it
to
you
tell
us
again
oh
do
tell
us
again
cried
gretel
throwing
herself
upon
the
wonderful
wooden
bench
that
her
brother
had
made
on
the
mother
s
last
birthday
hans
not
wishing
to
appear
childish
and
yet
quite
willing
to
hear
the
story
stood
carelessly
swinging
his
skates
against
the
fireplace
well
children
you
shall
hear
it
but
we
must
never
waste
the
daylight
again
in
this
way
pick
up
your
ball
gretel
and
let
your
sock
grow
as
i
talk
opening
your
ears
needn
t
shut
your
fingers
saint
nicholas
you
must
know
is
a
wonderful
saint
he
keeps
his
eye
open
for
the
good
of
sailors
but
he
cares
most
of
all
for
boys
and
girls
well
once
upon
a
time
when
he
was
living
on
the
earth
a
merchant
of
asia
sent
his
three
sons
to
a
great
city
called
athens
to
get
is
athens
in
holland
mother
asked
gretel
i
don
t
know
child
probably
it
oh
no
mother
said
hans
respectfully
i
had
that
in
my
geography
lessons
long
ago
athens
is
in
well
resumed
the
mother
what
matter
greece
may
belong
to
the
king
for
aught
we
know
anyhow
this
rich
merchant
sent
his
sons
to
athens
while
they
were
on
their
way
they
stopped
one
night
at
a
shabby
inn
meaning
to
take
up
their
journey
in
the
morning
well
they
had
very
fine
clothes
velvet
and
silk
it
may
be
such
as
rich
folks
children
all
over
the
world
think
nothing
of
wearing
and
their
belts
likewise
were
full
of
money
what
did
the
wicked
landlord
do
but
contrive
a
plan
to
kill
the
children
and
take
their
money
and
all
their
beautiful
clothes
himself
so
that
night
when
all
the
world
was
asleep
he
got
up
and
killed
the
three
young
gretel
clasped
her
hands
and
shuddered
but
hans
tried
to
look
as
if
killing
and
murder
were
everyday
matters
to
him
that
was
not
the
worst
of
it
continued
dame
brinker
knitting
slowly
and
trying
to
keep
count
of
her
stitches
as
she
talked
that
was
not
near
the
worst
of
it
the
dreadful
landlord
went
and
cut
up
the
young
gentlemen
s
bodies
into
little
pieces
and
threw
them
into
a
great
tub
of
brine
intending
to
sell
them
for
pickled
pork
oh
cried
gretel
though
she
had
often
heard
the
story
before
hans
was
still
unmoved
and
seemed
to
think
that
pickling
was
the
best
that
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances
yes
he
pickled
them
and
one
might
think
that
would
have
been
the
last
of
the
young
gentlemen
but
no
that
night
saint
nicholas
had
a
wonderful
vision
and
in
it
he
saw
the
landlord
cutting
up
the
merchant
s
children
there
was
no
need
of
his
hurrying
you
know
for
he
was
a
saint
but
in
the
morning
he
went
to
the
inn
and
charged
the
landlord
with
murder
then
the
wicked
landlord
confessed
it
from
beginning
to
end
and
fell
down
on
his
knees
begging
forgiveness
he
felt
so
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
that
he
asked
the
saint
to
bring
the
young
masters
to
and
did
the
saint
do
it
asked
gretel
delighted
well
knowing
what
the
answer
would
be
of
course
he
did
the
pickled
pieces
flew
together
in
an
instant
and
out
jumped
the
young
gentlemen
from
the
brine
tub
they
cast
themselves
at
the
feet
of
saint
nicholas
and
he
gave
them
his
blessing
and
oh
mercy
on
us
hans
it
will
be
dark
before
you
get
back
if
you
don
t
start
this
minute
by
this
time
dame
brinker
was
almost
out
of
breath
and
quite
out
of
commas
she
could
not
remember
when
she
had
seen
the
children
idle
away
an
hour
of
daylight
in
this
manner
and
the
thought
of
such
luxury
quite
appalled
her
by
way
of
compensation
she
now
flew
about
the
room
in
extreme
haste
tossing
a
block
of
peat
upon
the
fire
blowing
invisible
fire
from
the
table
and
handing
the
finished
hose
to
hans
all
in
an
instant
comes
hans
she
said
as
her
boy
lingered
by
the
door
what
keeps
thee
hans
kissed
his
mother
s
plump
cheek
rosy
and
fresh
yet
in
spite
of
all
her
troubles
my
mother
is
the
best
in
the
world
and
i
would
be
right
glad
to
have
a
pair
of
skates
but
and
as
he
buttoned
his
jacket
he
looked
in
a
troubled
way
toward
a
strange
figure
crouching
by
the
hearthstone
if
my
money
would
bring
a
meester
doctor
dokter
in
dutch
called
meester
by
the
lower
class
from
amsterdam
to
see
the
father
something
might
yet
be
a
meester
would
not
come
hans
for
twice
that
money
and
it
would
do
no
good
if
he
did
ah
how
many
guilders
i
once
spent
for
that
but
the
dear
good
father
would
not
waken
it
is
god
s
will
go
hans
and
buy
the
hans
started
with
a
heavy
heart
but
since
the
heart
was
young
and
in
a
boy
s
bosom
it
set
him
whistling
in
less
than
five
minutes
his
mother
had
said
thee
to
him
and
that
was
quite
enough
to
make
even
a
dark
day
sunny
hollanders
do
not
address
each
other
in
affectionate
intercourse
as
the
french
and
germans
do
but
dame
brinker
had
embroidered
for
a
heidelberg
family
in
her
girlhood
and
she
had
carried
its
thee
and
thou
into
her
rude
home
to
be
used
in
moments
of
extreme
love
and
tenderness
therefore
what
keeps
thee
hans
sang
an
echo
song
beneath
the
boy
s
whistling
and
made
him
feel
that
his
errand
was
blest
hans
has
his
way
broek
with
its
quiet
spotless
streets
its
frozen
rivulets
its
yellow
brick
pavements
and
bright
wooden
houses
was
nearby
it
was
a
village
where
neatness
and
show
were
in
full
blossom
but
the
inhabitants
seemed
to
be
either
asleep
or
dead
not
a
footprint
marred
the
sanded
paths
where
pebbles
and
seashells
lay
in
fanciful
designs
every
window
shutter
was
tightly
closed
as
though
air
and
sunshine
were
poison
and
the
massive
front
doors
were
never
opened
except
on
the
occasion
of
a
wedding
a
christening
or
a
funeral
serene
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
were
floating
through
hidden
corners
and
children
who
otherwise
might
have
awakened
the
place
were
studying
in
corners
or
skating
upon
the
neighboring
canal
a
few
peacocks
and
wolves
stood
in
the
gardens
but
they
had
never
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
flesh
and
blood
they
were
made
out
of
boxwood
hedges
and
seemed
to
be
guarding
the
grounds
with
a
sort
of
green
ferocity
certain
lively
automata
ducks
women
and
sportsmen
were
stowed
away
in
summer
houses
waiting
for
the
when
they
could
be
wound
up
and
rival
their
owners
in
animation
and
the
shining
tiled
roofs
mosaic
courtyards
and
polished
house
trimmings
flashed
up
a
silent
homage
to
the
sky
where
never
a
speck
of
dust
could
dwell
hans
glanced
toward
the
village
as
he
shook
his
silver
kwartjes
and
wondered
whether
it
were
really
true
as
he
had
often
heard
that
some
of
the
people
of
broek
were
so
rich
that
they
used
kitchen
utensils
of
solid
gold
he
had
seen
mevrouw
van
stoop
s
sweet
cheeses
in
market
and
he
knew
that
the
lofty
dame
earned
many
a
bright
silver
guilder
in
selling
them
but
did
she
set
the
cream
to
rise
in
golden
pans
did
she
use
a
golden
skimmer
when
her
cows
were
in
winter
quarters
were
their
tails
really
tied
up
with
ribbons
these
thoughts
ran
through
his
mind
as
he
turned
his
face
toward
amsterdam
not
five
miles
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
frozen
y
pronounced
eye
an
arm
of
the
zuider
zee
the
ice
upon
the
canal
was
perfect
but
his
wooden
runners
so
soon
to
be
cast
aside
squeaked
a
dismal
farewell
as
he
scraped
and
skimmed
along
when
crossing
the
y
whom
should
he
see
skating
toward
him
but
the
great
boekman
the
most
famous
physician
and
surgeon
in
holland
hans
had
never
met
him
before
but
he
had
seen
his
engraved
likeness
in
many
of
the
shop
windows
in
amsterdam
it
was
a
face
that
one
could
never
forget
thin
and
lank
though
a
born
dutchman
with
stern
blue
eyes
and
queer
compressed
lips
that
seemed
to
say
no
smiling
permitted
he
certainly
was
not
a
very
jolly
or
personage
nor
one
that
a
boy
would
care
to
accost
unbidden
but
hans
was
bidden
and
that
too
by
a
voice
he
seldom
disregarded
his
own
conscience
here
comes
the
greatest
doctor
in
the
world
whispered
the
voice
god
has
sent
him
you
have
no
right
to
buy
skates
when
you
might
with
the
same
money
purchase
such
aid
for
your
father
the
wooden
runners
gave
an
exultant
squeak
hundreds
of
beautiful
skates
were
gleaming
and
vanishing
in
the
air
above
him
he
felt
the
money
tingle
in
his
fingers
the
old
doctor
looked
fearfully
grim
and
forbidding
hans
s
heart
was
in
his
throat
but
he
found
voice
enough
to
cry
out
just
as
he
was
passing
mynheer
boekman
the
great
man
halted
and
sticking
out
his
thin
underlip
looked
scowling
about
him
hans
was
in
for
it
now
mynheer
he
panted
drawing
close
to
the
doctor
i
knew
you
could
be
none
other
than
the
famous
boekman
i
have
to
ask
a
great
favor
hump
muttered
the
doctor
preparing
to
skate
past
the
intruder
get
out
of
the
way
i
ve
no
money
never
give
to
i
am
no
beggar
mynheer
retorted
hans
proudly
at
the
same
time
producing
his
mite
of
silver
with
a
grand
air
i
wish
to
consult
you
about
my
father
he
is
a
living
man
but
sits
like
one
dead
he
can
not
think
his
words
mean
nothing
but
he
is
not
sick
he
fell
on
the
hey
what
cried
the
doctor
beginning
to
listen
hans
told
the
whole
story
in
an
incoherent
way
dashing
off
a
tear
once
or
twice
as
he
talked
and
finally
ending
with
an
earnest
oh
do
see
him
mynheer
his
body
is
well
it
is
only
his
mind
i
know
that
this
money
is
not
enough
but
take
it
mynheer
i
will
earn
more
i
know
i
will
oh
i
will
toil
for
you
all
my
life
if
you
will
but
cure
my
father
what
was
the
matter
with
the
old
doctor
a
brightness
like
sunlight
beamed
from
his
face
his
eyes
were
kind
and
moist
the
hand
that
had
lately
clutched
his
cane
as
if
preparing
to
strike
was
laid
gently
upon
hans
s
shoulder
put
up
your
money
boy
i
do
not
want
it
we
will
see
your
father
it
s
hopeless
i
fear
how
long
did
you
say
ten
years
mynheer
sobbed
hans
radiant
with
sudden
hope
ah
a
bad
case
but
i
shall
see
him
let
me
think
today
i
start
for
leyden
to
return
in
a
week
then
you
may
expect
me
where
is
it
a
mile
south
of
broek
mynheer
near
the
canal
it
is
only
a
poor
hut
any
of
the
children
thereabout
can
point
it
out
to
your
honor
added
hans
with
a
heavy
sigh
they
are
all
half
afraid
of
the
place
they
call
it
the
idiot
s
that
will
do
said
the
doctor
hurrying
on
with
a
bright
backward
nod
at
hans
i
shall
be
there
a
hopeless
case
he
muttered
to
himself
but
the
boy
pleases
me
his
eye
is
like
my
poor
laurens
s
confound
it
shall
i
never
forget
that
young
scoundrel
and
scowling
more
darkly
than
ever
the
doctor
pursued
his
silent
way
again
hans
was
skating
toward
amsterdam
on
the
squeaking
wooden
runners
again
his
fingers
tingled
against
the
money
in
his
pocket
again
the
boyish
whistle
rose
unconsciously
to
his
lips
shall
i
hurry
home
he
was
thinking
to
tell
the
good
news
or
shall
i
get
the
waffles
and
the
new
skates
first
whew
i
think
i
ll
go
on
and
so
hans
bought
the
skates
introducing
jacob
poot
and
his
cousin
hans
and
gretel
had
a
fine
frolic
early
on
that
saint
nicholas
s
eve
there
was
a
bright
moon
and
their
mother
though
she
believed
herself
to
be
without
any
hope
of
her
husband
s
improvement
had
been
made
so
happy
at
the
prospect
of
the
meester
s
visit
that
she
yielded
to
the
children
s
entreaties
for
an
hour
s
skating
before
bedtime
hans
was
delighted
with
his
new
skates
and
in
his
eagerness
to
show
gretel
how
perfectly
they
worked
did
many
things
upon
the
ice
that
caused
the
little
maid
to
clasp
her
hands
in
solemn
admiration
they
were
not
alone
though
they
seemed
quite
unheeded
by
the
various
groups
assembled
upon
the
canal
the
two
van
holps
and
carl
schummel
were
there
testing
their
fleetness
to
the
utmost
out
of
four
trials
peter
van
holp
had
won
three
times
consequently
carl
never
very
amiable
was
in
anything
but
a
good
humor
he
had
relieved
himself
by
taunting
young
schimmelpenninck
who
being
smaller
than
the
others
kept
meekly
near
them
without
feeling
exactly
like
one
of
the
party
but
now
a
new
thought
seized
carl
or
rather
he
seized
the
new
thought
and
made
an
onset
upon
his
friends
i
say
boys
let
s
put
a
stop
to
those
young
ragpickers
from
the
idiot
s
cottage
joining
the
race
hilda
must
be
crazy
to
think
of
it
katrinka
flack
and
rychie
korbes
are
furious
at
the
very
idea
of
racing
with
the
girl
and
for
my
part
i
don
t
blame
them
as
for
the
boy
if
we
ve
a
spark
of
manhood
in
us
we
will
scorn
the
very
idea
of
certainly
we
will
interposed
peter
van
holp
purposely
mistaking
carl
s
meaning
who
doubts
it
no
fellow
with
a
spark
of
manhood
in
him
would
refuse
to
let
in
two
good
skaters
just
because
they
were
poor
carl
wheeled
about
savagely
not
so
fast
master
and
i
d
thank
you
not
to
put
words
in
other
people
s
mouths
you
d
best
not
try
it
ha
ha
laughed
little
voostenwalbert
schimmelpenninck
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
a
fight
and
sure
that
if
it
should
come
to
blows
his
favorite
peter
could
beat
a
dozen
excitable
fellows
like
carl
something
in
peter
s
eye
made
carl
glad
to
turn
to
a
weaker
offender
he
wheeled
furiously
upon
voost
what
are
you
shrieking
about
you
little
weasel
you
skinny
herring
you
you
little
monkey
with
a
long
name
for
a
tail
half
a
dozen
bystanders
and
byskaters
set
up
an
applauding
shout
at
this
brave
witticism
and
carl
feeling
that
he
had
fairly
vanquished
his
foes
was
restored
to
partial
good
humor
he
however
prudently
resolved
to
defer
plotting
against
hans
and
gretel
until
some
time
when
peter
should
not
be
present
just
then
his
friend
jacob
poot
was
seen
approaching
they
could
not
distinguish
his
features
at
first
but
as
he
was
the
stoutest
boy
in
the
neighborhood
there
could
be
no
mistaking
his
form
hello
here
comes
fatty
exclaimed
carl
and
there
s
someone
with
him
a
slender
fellow
a
ha
ha
that
s
like
good
bacon
cried
ludwig
a
streak
of
lean
and
a
streak
of
that
s
jacob
s
english
cousin
put
in
master
voost
delighted
at
being
able
to
give
the
information
that
s
his
english
cousin
and
oh
he
s
got
such
a
funny
little
name
ben
dobbs
he
s
going
to
stay
with
him
until
after
the
grand
all
this
time
the
boys
had
been
spinning
turning
rolling
and
doing
other
feats
upon
their
skates
in
a
quiet
way
as
they
talked
but
now
they
stood
still
bracing
themselves
against
the
frosty
air
as
jacob
poot
and
his
friend
drew
near
this
is
my
cousin
boys
said
jacob
rather
out
of
breath
benjamin
dobbs
he
s
a
john
bull
and
he
s
going
to
be
in
the
all
crowded
about
the
newcomers
benjamin
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
the
hollanders
notwithstanding
their
queer
gibberish
were
a
fine
set
of
fellows
if
the
truth
must
be
told
jacob
had
announced
his
cousin
as
penchamin
dopps
and
called
his
a
shon
pull
but
as
i
translate
every
word
of
the
conversation
of
our
young
friends
it
is
no
more
than
fair
to
mend
their
little
attempts
at
english
master
dobbs
felt
at
first
decidedly
awkward
among
his
cousin
s
friends
though
most
of
them
had
studied
english
and
french
they
were
shy
about
attempting
to
speak
either
and
he
made
very
funny
blunders
when
he
tried
to
converse
in
dutch
he
had
learned
that
vrouw
meant
wife
and
ja
yes
and
spoorweg
railway
kanaals
canals
stoomboot
steamboat
ophaalbruggen
drawbridges
buiten
plasten
country
seats
mynheer
mister
tweegevegt
duel
or
two
fights
koper
copper
zadel
saddle
but
he
could
not
make
a
sentence
out
of
these
nor
use
the
long
list
of
phrases
he
had
learned
in
his
dutch
the
topics
of
the
latter
were
fine
but
were
never
alluded
to
by
the
boys
like
the
poor
fellow
who
had
learned
in
ollendorf
to
ask
in
faultless
german
have
you
seen
my
grandmother
s
red
cow
and
when
he
reached
germany
discovered
that
he
had
no
occasion
to
inquire
after
that
interesting
animal
ben
found
that
his
did
not
avail
him
as
much
as
he
had
hoped
he
acquired
a
hearty
contempt
for
jan
van
gorp
a
hollander
who
wrote
a
book
in
latin
to
prove
that
adam
and
eve
spoke
dutch
and
he
smiled
a
knowing
smile
when
his
uncle
poot
assured
him
that
dutch
had
great
likeness
mit
zinglish
but
it
vash
much
petter
languish
much
however
the
fun
of
skating
glides
over
all
barriers
of
speech
through
this
ben
soon
felt
that
he
knew
the
boys
well
and
when
jacob
with
a
sprinkling
of
french
and
english
for
ben
s
benefit
told
of
a
grand
project
they
had
planned
his
cousin
could
now
and
then
put
in
a
ja
or
a
nod
in
quite
a
familiar
way
the
project
was
a
grand
one
and
there
was
to
be
a
fine
opportunity
for
carrying
it
out
for
besides
the
allotted
holiday
of
the
festival
of
saint
nicholas
four
extra
days
were
to
be
allowed
for
a
general
cleaning
of
the
schoolhouse
jacob
and
ben
had
obtained
permission
to
go
on
a
long
skating
journey
no
less
a
one
than
from
broek
to
the
hague
the
capital
of
holland
a
distance
of
nearly
fifty
miles
throughout
this
narrative
distances
are
given
according
to
our
standard
the
english
statute
mile
of
feet
the
dutch
mile
is
more
than
four
times
as
long
as
ours
and
now
boys
added
jacob
when
he
had
told
the
plan
who
will
go
with
us
i
will
i
will
cried
the
boys
eagerly
and
so
will
i
ventured
little
voostenwalbert
ha
ha
laughed
jacob
holding
his
fat
sides
and
shaking
his
puffy
cheeks
you
go
such
a
little
fellow
as
you
why
youngster
you
haven
t
left
off
your
pads
yet
now
in
holland
very
young
children
wear
a
thin
padded
cushion
around
their
heads
surmounted
with
a
framework
of
whalebone
and
ribbon
to
protect
them
in
case
of
a
fall
and
it
is
the
dividing
line
between
babyhood
and
childhood
when
they
leave
it
off
voost
had
arrived
at
this
dignity
several
years
before
consequently
jacob
s
insult
was
rather
to
great
for
endurance
look
out
what
you
say
he
squeaked
lucky
for
you
when
you
can
leave
off
your
pads
you
re
padded
all
over
ha
ha
roared
all
the
boys
except
master
dobbs
who
could
not
understand
ha
ha
and
the
jacob
laughed
more
than
any
it
ish
my
fat
yaw
he
say
i
bees
pad
mit
fat
he
explained
to
ben
so
a
vote
was
passed
unanimously
in
favor
of
allowing
the
now
popular
voost
to
join
the
party
if
his
parents
would
consent
good
night
sang
out
the
happy
youngster
skating
homeward
with
all
his
might
good
night
we
can
stop
at
haarlem
jacob
and
show
your
cousin
the
big
organ
said
peter
van
holp
eagerly
and
at
leyden
too
where
there
s
no
end
to
the
sights
and
spend
a
day
and
night
at
the
hague
for
my
married
sister
who
lives
there
will
be
delighted
to
see
us
and
the
next
morning
we
can
start
for
all
right
responded
jacob
who
was
not
much
of
a
talker
ludwig
had
been
regarding
his
brother
with
enthusiastic
admiration
hurrah
for
you
pete
it
takes
you
to
make
plans
mother
ll
be
as
full
of
it
as
we
are
when
we
tell
her
we
can
take
her
love
direct
to
sister
van
gend
my
but
it
s
cold
he
added
cold
enough
to
take
a
fellow
s
head
off
his
shoulders
we
d
better
go
what
if
it
is
cold
old
cried
carl
who
was
busily
practicing
a
step
he
called
the
double
great
skating
we
should
have
by
this
time
if
it
was
as
warm
as
it
was
last
december
don
t
you
know
that
if
it
wasn
t
an
extra
cold
winter
and
an
early
one
into
the
bargain
we
couldn
t
go
i
know
it
s
an
extra
cold
night
anyhow
said
ludwig
whew
i
m
going
home
peter
van
holp
took
out
a
bulgy
gold
watch
and
holding
it
toward
the
moonlight
as
well
as
his
benumbed
fingers
would
permit
called
out
halloo
it
s
nearly
eight
o
clock
saint
nicholas
is
about
by
this
time
and
i
for
one
want
to
see
the
little
ones
stare
good
night
good
night
cried
one
and
all
and
off
they
started
shouting
singing
and
laughing
as
they
flew
along
where
were
gretel
and
hans
ah
how
suddenly
joy
sometimes
comes
to
an
end
they
had
skated
about
an
hour
keeping
aloof
from
the
others
quite
contented
with
each
other
and
gretel
had
exclaimed
ah
hans
how
beautiful
how
fine
to
think
that
we
both
have
skates
i
tell
you
the
stork
brought
us
good
luck
when
they
heard
something
it
was
a
scream
a
very
faint
scream
no
one
else
upon
the
canal
observed
it
but
hans
knew
its
meaning
too
well
gretel
saw
him
turn
white
in
the
moonlight
as
he
busily
tore
off
his
skates
the
father
he
cried
he
has
frightened
our
mother
and
gretel
ran
after
him
toward
the
house
as
rapidly
as
she
could
the
festival
of
saint
nicholas
we
all
know
how
before
the
christmas
tree
began
to
flourish
in
the
home
life
of
our
country
a
certain
right
jolly
old
elf
with
eight
tiny
reindeer
used
to
drive
his
of
toys
up
to
our
housetops
and
then
bounded
down
the
chimney
to
fill
the
stockings
so
hopefully
hung
by
the
fireplace
his
friends
called
his
santa
claus
and
those
who
were
most
intimate
ventured
to
say
old
it
was
said
that
he
originally
came
from
holland
doubtless
he
did
but
if
so
he
certainly
like
many
other
foreigners
changed
his
ways
very
much
after
landing
upon
our
shores
in
holland
saint
nicholas
is
a
veritable
saint
and
often
appears
in
full
costume
with
his
embroidered
robes
glittering
with
gems
and
gold
his
miter
his
crosier
and
his
jeweled
gloves
here
santa
claus
comes
rollicking
along
on
the
of
december
our
holy
christmas
morn
but
in
holland
saint
nicholas
visits
earth
on
the
fifth
a
time
especially
appropriated
to
him
early
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
he
distributes
his
candies
toys
and
treasures
then
vanishes
for
a
year
christmas
day
is
devoted
by
the
hollanders
to
church
rites
and
pleasant
family
visiting
it
is
on
saint
nicholas
s
eve
that
their
young
people
become
half
wild
with
joy
and
expectation
to
some
of
them
it
is
a
sorry
time
for
the
saint
is
very
candid
and
if
any
of
them
have
been
bad
during
the
past
year
he
is
quite
sure
to
tell
them
so
sometimes
he
gives
a
birch
rod
under
his
arm
and
advises
the
parents
to
give
them
scoldings
in
place
of
confections
and
floggings
instead
of
toys
it
was
well
that
the
boys
hastened
to
their
abodes
on
that
bright
winter
evening
for
in
less
than
an
hour
afterward
the
saint
made
his
appearance
in
half
the
homes
of
holland
he
visited
the
king
s
palace
and
in
the
selfsame
moment
appeared
in
annie
bouman
s
comfortable
home
probably
one
of
our
silver
would
have
purchased
all
that
his
saintship
left
at
the
peasant
bouman
s
but
a
s
worth
will
sometimes
do
for
the
poor
what
hundreds
of
dollars
may
fail
to
do
for
the
rich
it
makes
them
happy
and
grateful
fills
them
with
new
peace
and
love
hilda
van
gleck
s
little
brothers
and
sisters
were
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
that
night
they
had
been
admitted
into
the
grand
parlor
they
were
dressed
in
their
best
and
had
been
given
two
cakes
apiece
at
supper
hilda
was
as
joyous
as
any
why
not
saint
nicholas
would
never
cross
a
girl
of
fourteen
from
his
list
just
because
she
was
tall
and
looked
almost
like
a
woman
on
the
contrary
he
would
probably
exert
himself
to
do
honor
to
such
an
damsel
who
could
tell
so
she
sported
and
laughed
and
danced
as
gaily
as
the
youngest
and
was
the
soul
of
all
their
merry
games
her
father
mother
and
grandmother
looked
on
approvingly
so
did
her
grandfather
before
he
spread
his
large
red
handkerchief
over
his
face
leaving
only
the
top
of
his
skullcap
visible
this
kerchief
was
his
ensign
of
sleep
earlier
in
the
evening
all
had
joined
in
the
fun
in
the
general
hilarity
there
had
seemed
to
be
a
difference
only
in
bulk
between
grandfather
and
the
baby
indeed
a
shade
of
solemn
expectation
now
and
then
flitting
across
the
faces
of
the
younger
members
had
made
them
seem
rather
more
thoughtful
than
their
elders
now
the
spirit
of
fun
reigned
supreme
the
very
flames
danced
and
capered
in
the
polished
grate
a
pair
of
prim
candles
that
had
been
staring
at
the
astral
lamp
began
to
wink
at
other
candles
far
away
in
the
mirrors
there
was
a
long
bell
rope
suspended
from
the
ceiling
in
the
corner
made
of
glass
beads
netted
over
a
cord
nearly
as
thick
as
your
wrist
it
is
generally
hung
in
the
shadow
and
made
no
sign
but
tonight
it
twinkled
from
end
to
end
its
handle
of
crimson
glass
sent
reckless
dashes
of
red
at
the
papered
wall
turning
its
dainty
blue
stripes
into
purple
passersby
halted
to
catch
the
merry
laughter
floating
through
curtain
and
sash
into
the
street
then
skipped
on
their
way
with
a
startled
consciousness
that
the
village
was
at
last
matters
grew
so
uproarious
that
the
grandsire
s
red
kerchief
came
down
from
his
face
with
a
jerk
what
decent
old
gentleman
could
sleep
in
such
a
racket
mynheer
van
gleck
regarded
his
children
with
astonishment
the
baby
even
showed
symptoms
of
hysterics
it
was
high
time
to
attend
to
business
madame
suggested
that
if
they
wished
to
see
the
good
saint
nicholas
they
should
sing
the
same
loving
invitation
that
had
brought
him
the
year
before
the
baby
stared
and
thrust
his
fist
into
his
mouth
as
mynheer
put
him
down
upon
the
floor
soon
he
sat
erect
and
looked
with
a
sweet
scowl
at
the
company
with
his
lace
and
embroideries
and
his
crown
of
blue
ribbon
and
whalebone
for
he
was
not
quite
past
the
tumbling
age
he
looked
like
the
king
of
the
babies
the
other
children
each
holding
a
pretty
willow
basket
formed
a
ring
at
once
and
moved
slowly
around
the
little
fellow
lifting
their
eyes
for
the
saint
to
whom
they
were
about
to
address
themselves
was
yet
in
mysterious
quarters
madame
commenced
playing
softly
upon
the
piano
soon
the
voices
rose
gentle
youthful
voices
rendered
all
the
sweeter
for
their
tremor
welcome
friend
saint
nicholas
welcome

no
rod
for

while
our
voices

so
we
sing
so
we
sing
thou
wilt
bring
us
everything
during
the
chorus
sundry
glances
half
in
eagerness
half
in
dread
had
been
cast
toward
the
polished
folding
doors
now
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
the
circle
was
broken
in
an
instant
some
of
the
little
ones
with
a
strange
mixture
of
fear
and
delight
pressed
against
their
mother
s
knee
grandfather
bent
forward
with
his
chin
resting
upon
his
hand
grandmother
lifted
her
spectacles
mynheer
van
gleck
seated
by
the
fireplace
slowly
drew
his
meerschaum
from
his
mouth
while
hilda
and
the
other
children
settled
themselves
beside
him
in
an
expectant
group
the
knocking
was
heard
again
come
in
said
madame
softly
the
door
slowly
opened
and
saint
nicholas
in
full
array
stood
before
them
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
soon
he
spoke
what
a
mysterious
majesty
in
his
voice
what
kindliness
in
his
tones

the
haarlem
fair
last
fall
but
he
has
tried
to
atone
for
it
since
mayken
has
failed
of
late
in
her
lessons
and
too
many
sweets
and
trifles
have
gone
to
her
lips
and
too
few
stivers
to
her
charity
box
diedrich
i
trust
will
be
a
polite
manly
boy
for
the
future
and
mayken
will
endeavor
to
shine
as
a
student
let
her
remember
too
that
economy
and
thrift
are
needed
in
the
foundation
of
a
worthy
and
generous
life
little
katy
has
been
cruel
to
the
cat
more
than
once
saint
nicholas
can
hear
the
cat
cry
when
its
tail
is
pulled
i
will
forgive
her
if
she
will
remember
from
this
hour
that
the
smallest
dumb
creatures
have
feelings
and
must
not
be
as
katy
burst
into
a
frightened
cry
the
saint
graciously
remained
silent
until
she
was
soothed
master
broom
he
resumed
i
warn
thee
that
the
boys
who
are
in
the
habit
of
putting
snuff
upon
the
foot
stove
of
the
schoolmistress
may
one
day
be
discovered
and
receive
a
flogging
master
broom
colored
and
stared
in
great
astonishment
but
thou
art
such
an
excellent
scholar
i
shall
make
thee
no
further
thou
hendrick
didst
distinguish
thyself
in
the
archery
match
last
spring
and
hit
the
doel
bull
though
the
bird
was
swung
before
it
to
unsteady
thine
eye
i
give
thee
credit
for
excelling
in
manly
sport
and
exercise
though
i
must
not
unduly
countenance
thy
boat
racing
since
it
leaves
thee
little
time
for
thy
proper
studies
lucretia
and
hilda
shall
have
a
blessed
sleep
tonight
the
consciousness
of
kindness
to
the
poor
devotion
in
their
souls
and
cheerful
hearty
obedience
to
household
rule
will
render
them
happy
with
one
and
all
i
avow
myself
well
content
goodness
industry
benevolence
and
thrift
have
prevailed
in
your
midst
therefore
my
blessing
upon
you
and
may
the
new
year
find
all
treading
the
paths
of
obedience
wisdom
and
love
tomorrow
you
shall
find
more
substantial
proofs
that
i
have
been
in
your
midst
farewell
with
these
words
came
a
great
shower
of
sugarplums
upon
a
linen
sheet
spread
out
in
front
of
the
doors
a
general
scramble
followed
the
children
fairly
tumbled
over
each
other
in
their
eagerness
to
fill
their
baskets
madame
cautiously
held
the
baby
down
in
their
midst
till
the
chubby
little
fists
were
filled
then
the
bravest
of
the
youngsters
sprang
up
and
burst
open
the
closed
doors
in
vain
they
peered
into
the
mysterious
apartment
saint
nicholas
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
soon
there
was
a
general
rush
to
another
room
where
stood
a
table
covered
with
the
finest
and
whitest
of
linen
damask
each
child
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
laid
a
shoe
upon
it
the
door
was
then
carefully
locked
and
its
key
hidden
in
the
mother
s
bedroom
next
followed
goodnight
kisses
a
grand
family
procession
to
the
upper
floor
merry
farewells
at
bedroom
doors
and
silence
at
last
reigned
in
the
van
gleck
mansion
early
the
next
morning
the
door
was
solemnly
unlocked
and
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
household
when
lo
a
sight
appeared
proving
saint
nicholas
to
be
a
saint
of
his
word
every
shoe
was
filled
to
overflowing
and
beside
each
stood
many
a
colored
pile
the
table
was
heavy
with
its
load
of
presents
candies
toys
trinkets
books
and
other
articles
everyone
had
gifts
from
the
grandfather
down
to
the
baby
little
katy
clapped
her
hands
with
glee
and
vowed
inwardly
that
the
cat
should
never
know
another
moment
s
grief
hendrick
capered
about
the
room
flourishing
a
superb
bow
and
arrows
over
his
head
hilda
laughed
with
delight
as
she
opened
a
crimson
box
and
drew
forth
its
glittering
contents
the
rest
chuckled
and
said
oh
and
ah
over
their
treasures
very
much
as
we
did
here
in
america
on
last
christmas
day
with
her
glittering
necklace
in
her
hands
and
a
pile
of
books
in
her
arms
hilda
stole
towards
her
parents
and
held
up
her
beaming
face
for
a
kiss
there
was
such
an
earnest
tender
look
in
her
bright
eyes
that
her
mother
breathed
a
blessing
as
she
leaned
over
her
i
am
delighted
with
this
book
thank
you
father
she
said
touching
the
top
one
with
her
chin
i
shall
read
it
all
day
aye
sweetheart
said
mynheer
you
can
not
do
better
there
is
no
one
like
father
cats
if
my
daughter
learns
his
moral
emblems
by
heart
the
mother
and
i
may
keep
silent
the
work
you
have
there
is
the
emblems
his
best
work
you
will
find
it
enriched
with
rare
engravings
from
van
de
considering
that
the
back
of
the
book
was
turned
away
mynheer
certainly
showed
a
surprising
familiarity
with
an
unopened
volume
presented
by
saint
nicholas
it
was
strange
too
that
the
saint
should
have
found
certain
things
made
by
the
elder
children
and
had
actually
placed
them
upon
the
table
labeled
with
parents
and
grandparents
names
but
all
were
too
much
absorbed
in
happiness
to
notice
slight
inconsistencies
hilda
saw
on
her
father
s
face
the
rapt
expression
he
always
wore
when
he
spoke
of
jakob
cats
so
he
put
her
armful
of
books
upon
the
table
and
resigned
herself
to
listen
old
father
cats
my
child
was
a
great
poet
not
a
writer
of
plays
like
the
englishman
shakespeare
who
lived
in
his
time
i
have
read
them
in
the
german
and
very
good
they
are
very
very
good
but
not
like
father
cats
cats
sees
no
daggers
in
the
air
he
has
no
white
women
falling
in
love
with
dusky
moors
no
young
fools
sighing
to
be
a
lady
s
glove
no
crazy
princes
mistaking
respectable
old
gentlemen
for
rats
no
no
he
writes
only
sense
it
is
great
wisdom
in
little
bundles
a
bundle
for
every
day
of
your
life
you
can
guide
a
state
with
cats
s
poems
and
you
can
put
a
little
baby
to
sleep
with
his
pretty
songs
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
men
of
holland
when
i
take
you
to
the
hague
i
will
show
you
the
kloosterkerk
where
he
lies
buried
there
was
a
man
for
you
to
study
my
sons
he
was
good
through
and
through
what
did
he
say
o
lord
let
me
obtain
this
from
thee
to
live
with
patience
and
to
die
with
pleasure
o
heere
laat
my
daat
van
uwen
hand
verwerven
te
leven
met
gedult
en
met
vermaak
te
sterven
did
patience
mean
folding
his
hands
no
he
was
a
lawyer
statesman
ambassador
farmer
philosopher
historian
and
poet
he
was
keeper
of
the
great
seal
of
holland
he
was
a
bah
there
is
too
much
noise
here
i
can
not
and
mynheer
looking
with
great
astonishment
into
the
bowl
of
his
meerschaum
for
it
had
gone
out
nodded
to
his
vrouw
and
left
the
apartment
in
great
haste
the
fact
is
his
discourse
had
been
accompanied
throughout
with
a
subdued
chorus
of
barking
dogs
squeaking
cats
and
bleating
lambs
to
say
nothing
of
a
noisy
ivory
cricket
that
the
baby
was
whirling
with
infinite
delight
at
the
last
little
huygens
taking
advantage
of
the
increasing
loudness
of
mynheer
s
tones
had
ventured
a
blast
on
his
new
trumpet
and
wolfert
had
hastily
attempted
an
accompaniment
on
the
drum
this
had
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
and
it
was
good
for
the
little
creatures
that
it
had
the
saint
had
left
no
ticket
for
them
to
attend
a
lecture
on
jakob
cats
it
was
not
an
appointed
part
of
the
ceremonies
therefore
when
the
youngsters
saw
that
the
mother
looked
neither
frightened
nor
offended
they
gathered
new
courage
the
grand
chorus
rose
triumphant
and
frolic
and
joy
reigned
supreme
good
saint
nicholas
for
the
sake
of
the
young
hollanders
i
for
one
am
willing
to
acknowledge
him
and
defend
his
reality
against
all
unbelievers
carl
schummel
was
quite
busy
during
that
day
assuring
little
children
confidentially
that
not
saint
nicholas
but
their
own
fathers
and
mothers
had
produced
the
oracle
and
loaded
the
tables
but
we
know
better
than
that
and
yet
if
this
were
a
saint
why
did
he
not
visit
the
brinker
cottage
that
night
why
was
that
one
home
so
dark
and
sorrowful
passed
by
what
the
boys
saw
and
did
in
amsterdam
are
we
all
here
cried
peter
in
high
glee
as
the
party
assembled
upon
the
canal
early
the
next
morning
equipped
for
their
skating
journey
let
me
see

boys
it

just
eight
o
clock
glorious
weather
and
the
y
is
as
firm
as
a
rock
we
ll
be
at
amsterdam
in
thirty
minutes
one
two
three
start
true
enough
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
had
crossed
a
dike
of
solid
masonry
and
were
in
the
very
heart
of
the
great
metropolis
of
the
netherlands
a
walled
city
of
islands
and
nearly
two
hundred
bridges
although
ben
had
been
there
twice
since
his
arrival
in
holland
he
saw
much
to
excite
wonder
but
his
dutch
comrades
having
lived
nearby
all
their
lives
considered
it
the
most
place
in
the
world
everything
interested
ben
the
tall
houses
with
their
forked
chimneys
and
gable
ends
facing
the
street
the
merchants
ware
rooms
perched
high
up
under
the
roofs
of
their
dwellings
with
long
armlike
cranes
hoisting
and
lowering
goods
past
the
household
windows
the
grand
public
buildings
erected
upon
wooden
piles
driven
deep
into
the
marshy
ground
the
narrow
streets
the
canals
crossing
the
city
everywhere
the
bridges
the
locks
the
various
costumes
and
strangest
of
all
shops
and
dwellings
crouching
close
to
the
fronts
of
the
churches
sending
their
long
disproportionate
chimneys
far
upward
along
the
sacred
walls
if
he
looked
up
he
saw
tall
leaning
houses
seeming
to
pierce
the
sky
with
their
shining
roofs
if
he
looked
down
there
was
the
queer
street
without
crossing
or
curb
nothing
to
separate
the
cobblestone
pavement
from
the
footpath
of
brick
and
if
he
rested
his
eyes
halfway
he
saw
complicated
little
mirrors
spionnen
fastened
upon
the
outside
of
nearly
every
window
so
arranged
that
the
inmates
of
the
houses
could
observe
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
street
or
inspect
whoever
might
be
knocking
at
the
door
without
being
seen
themselves
sometimes
a
dogcart
heaped
with
wooden
ware
passed
him
then
a
donkey
bearing
a
pair
of
panniers
filled
with
crockery
or
glass
then
a
sled
driven
over
the
bare
cobblestones
the
runners
kept
greased
with
a
dripping
oil
rag
so
that
it
might
run
easily
and
then
perhaps
a
showy
but
clumsy
family
carriage
drawn
by
the
brownest
of
flanders
horses
swinging
the
whitest
of
snowy
tails
the
city
was
in
full
festival
array
every
shop
was
gorgeous
in
honor
of
saint
nicholas
captain
peter
was
forced
more
than
once
to
order
his
men
away
from
the
tempting
show
windows
where
everything
that
is
has
been
or
can
be
thought
of
in
the
way
of
toys
was
displayed
holland
is
famous
for
this
branch
of
manufacture
every
possible
thing
is
copied
in
miniature
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
ones
the
intricate
mechanical
toys
that
a
dutch
youngster
tumbles
about
in
stolid
unconcern
would
create
a
stir
in
our
patent
office
ben
laughed
outright
at
some
of
the
mimic
fishing
boats
they
were
so
heavy
and
stumpy
so
like
the
queer
craft
that
he
had
seen
about
rotterdam
the
tiny
trekschuiten
however
only
a
foot
or
two
long
and
fitted
out
complete
made
his
heart
ache
he
so
longed
to
buy
one
at
once
for
his
little
brother
in
england
he
had
no
money
to
spare
for
with
true
dutch
prudence
the
party
had
agreed
to
take
with
them
merely
the
sum
required
for
each
boy
s
expenses
and
to
consign
the
purse
to
peter
for
safekeeping
consequently
master
ben
concluded
to
devote
all
his
energies
to
and
to
think
as
seldom
as
possible
of
little
robby
he
made
a
hasty
call
at
the
marine
school
and
envied
the
sailor
students
their
brig
and
their
sleeping
berths
swung
over
their
trunks
or
lockers
he
peeped
into
the
jews
quarter
of
the
city
where
the
rich
diamond
cutters
and
squalid
dwell
and
wisely
resolved
to
keep
away
from
it
he
also
enjoyed
hasty
glimpses
of
the
four
principal
avenues
of
amsterdam
the
prinsengracht
keizersgracht
herengracht
and
singel
these
are
semicircular
in
form
and
the
first
three
average
more
than
two
miles
in
length
a
canal
runs
through
the
center
of
each
with
a
road
on
either
side
lined
with
stately
buildings
rows
of
naked
elms
bordering
the
canal
cast
a
network
of
shadows
over
its
frozen
surface
and
everything
was
so
clean
and
bright
that
ben
told
lambert
it
seemed
to
him
like
petrified
neatness
fortunately
the
weather
was
cold
enough
to
put
a
stop
to
the
usual
street
flooding
and
or
our
young
excursionists
might
have
been
drenched
more
than
once
sweeping
mopping
and
scrubbing
form
a
passion
with
dutch
housewives
and
to
soil
their
spotless
mansions
is
considered
scarcely
less
than
a
crime
everywhere
a
hearty
contempt
is
felt
for
those
who
neglect
to
rub
the
soles
of
their
shoes
to
a
polish
before
crossing
the
doorsill
and
in
certain
places
visitors
are
expected
to
remove
their
heavy
shoes
before
entering
sir
william
temple
in
his
memoirs
of
what
passed
in
christendom
from
to
tells
a
story
of
a
pompous
magistrate
going
to
visit
a
lady
of
amsterdam
a
stout
holland
lass
opened
the
door
and
told
him
in
a
breath
that
the
lady
was
at
home
and
that
his
shoes
were
not
very
clean
without
another
word
she
took
the
astonished
man
up
by
both
arms
threw
him
across
her
back
carried
him
through
two
rooms
set
him
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
seized
a
pair
of
slippers
that
stood
there
and
put
them
upon
his
feet
then
and
not
until
then
she
spoke
telling
him
that
his
mistress
was
on
the
floor
above
and
that
he
might
go
up
while
ben
was
skating
with
his
friends
upon
the
crowded
canals
of
the
city
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
sleepy
dutchmen
he
saw
around
him
smoking
their
pipes
so
leisurely
and
looking
as
though
their
hats
might
be
knocked
off
their
heads
without
their
making
any
resistance
were
capable
of
those
outbreaks
that
had
taken
place
in
holland
that
they
were
really
fellow
countrymen
of
the
brave
devoted
heroes
of
whom
he
had
read
in
dutch
history
as
his
party
skimmed
lightly
along
he
told
van
mounen
of
a
burial
riot
which
in
had
occurred
in
that
very
city
where
the
women
and
children
turned
out
as
well
as
the
men
and
formed
mock
funeral
processions
through
the
town
to
show
the
burgomasters
that
certain
new
regulations
with
regard
to
burying
the
dead
would
not
be
acceded
to
how
at
last
they
grew
so
unmanageable
and
threatened
so
much
damage
to
the
city
that
the
burgomasters
were
glad
to
recall
the
offensive
law
there
s
the
corner
said
jacob
pointing
to
some
large
buildings
where
about
fifteen
years
ago
the
great
corn
houses
sank
down
in
the
mud
they
were
strong
affairs
and
set
up
on
good
piles
but
they
had
over
seven
million
pounds
of
corn
in
them
and
that
was
too
it
was
a
long
story
for
jacob
to
tell
and
he
stopped
to
rest
how
do
you
know
there
were
seven
million
pounds
in
them
asked
carl
sharply
you
were
in
your
swaddling
clothes
my
father
knows
all
about
it
was
jacob
s
suggestive
reply
rousing
himself
with
an
effort
he
continued
ben
likes
pictures
show
him
all
right
said
the
captain
if
we
had
time
benjamin
said
lambert
van
mounen
in
english
i
should
like
to
take
you
to
the
city
hall
or
stadhuis
there
are
building
piles
for
you
it
is
built
on
nearly
fourteen
thousand
of
them
driven
seventy
feet
into
the
ground
but
what
i
wish
you
to
see
there
is
the
big
picture
of
van
speyk
blowing
up
his
ship
great
van
who
asked
ben
van
speyk
don
t
you
remember
he
was
in
the
height
of
an
engagement
with
the
belgians
and
when
he
found
that
they
had
the
better
of
him
and
would
capture
his
ship
he
blew
it
up
and
himself
too
rather
than
yield
to
the
wasn
t
that
van
tromp
oh
no
van
tromp
was
another
brave
fellow
they
ve
a
monument
to
him
down
at
delftshaven
the
place
where
the
pilgrims
took
ship
for
well
what
about
van
tromp
he
was
a
great
dutch
admiral
wasn
t
he
yes
he
was
in
more
than
thirty
sea
fights
he
beat
the
spanish
fleet
and
an
english
one
and
then
fastened
a
broom
to
his
masthead
to
show
that
he
had
swept
the
english
from
the
sea
takes
the
dutch
to
beat
my
boy
hold
up
cried
ben
broom
or
no
broom
the
english
conquered
him
at
last
i
remember
all
about
it
now
he
was
killed
somewhere
on
the
dutch
coast
in
an
engagement
in
which
the
english
fleet
was
victorious
too
bad
he
added
maliciously
wasn
t
it
ahem
where
are
we
exclaimed
lambert
changing
the
subject
halloo
the
others
are
way
ahead
of
us
all
but
jacob
whew
how
fat
he
is
he
ll
break
down
before
we
re
ben
of
course
enjoyed
skating
beside
lambert
who
though
a
staunch
hollander
had
been
educated
near
london
and
could
speak
english
as
fluently
as
dutch
but
he
was
not
sorry
when
captain
van
holp
called
out
skates
off
there
s
the
museum
it
was
open
and
there
was
no
charge
on
that
day
for
admission
in
they
went
shuffling
as
boys
will
when
they
have
a
chance
just
to
hear
the
sound
of
their
shoes
on
the
polished
floor
this
museum
is
in
fact
a
picture
gallery
where
some
of
the
finest
works
of
the
dutch
masters
are
to
be
seen
besides
nearly
two
hundred
portfolios
of
rare
engravings
ben
noticed
at
once
that
some
of
the
pictures
were
hung
on
panels
fastened
to
the
wall
with
hinges
these
could
be
swung
forward
like
a
window
shutter
thus
enabling
the
subject
to
be
seen
in
the
best
light
the
plan
served
them
well
in
viewing
a
small
group
by
gerard
douw
called
the
evening
school
enabling
them
to
observe
its
exquisite
finish
and
the
wonderful
way
in
which
the
picture
seemed
to
be
lit
through
its
own
windows
peter
pointed
out
the
beauties
of
another
picture
by
douw
called
the
hermit
and
he
also
told
them
some
interesting
anecdotes
of
the
artist
who
was
born
at
leyden
in
three
days
painting
a
broom
handle
echoed
carl
in
astonishment
while
the
captain
was
giving
some
instances
of
douw
s
extreme
slowness
of
execution
yes
sir
three
days
and
it
is
said
that
he
spent
five
in
finishing
one
hand
in
a
lady
s
portrait
you
see
how
very
bright
and
minute
everything
is
in
this
picture
his
unfinished
works
were
kept
carefully
covered
and
his
painting
materials
were
put
away
in
airtight
boxes
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
using
them
for
the
day
according
to
all
accounts
the
studio
itself
must
have
been
as
close
as
a
bandbox
the
artist
always
entered
it
on
tiptoe
besides
sitting
still
before
he
commenced
work
until
the
slight
dust
caused
by
his
entrance
had
settled
i
have
read
somewhere
that
his
paintings
are
improved
by
being
viewed
through
a
magnifying
glass
he
strained
his
eyes
so
badly
with
the
extra
finishing
that
he
was
forced
to
wear
spectacles
before
he
was
thirty
at
forty
he
could
scarcely
see
to
paint
and
he
couldn
t
find
a
pair
of
glasses
anywhere
that
would
help
his
sight
at
last
a
poor
old
german
woman
asked
him
to
try
hers
they
suited
him
exactly
and
enabled
him
to
go
on
painting
as
well
as
humph
exclaimed
ludwig
indignantly
that
was
high
what
did
she
do
without
them
i
wonder
oh
said
peter
laughing
likely
she
had
another
pair
at
any
rate
she
insisted
upon
his
taking
them
he
was
so
grateful
that
he
painted
a
picture
of
the
spectacles
for
her
case
and
all
and
she
sold
it
to
a
burgomaster
for
a
yearly
allowance
that
made
her
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
her
boys
called
lambert
in
a
loud
whisper
come
look
at
this
bear
it
was
a
fine
painting
by
paul
potter
a
dutch
artist
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
produced
excellent
works
before
he
was
sixteen
years
old
the
boys
admired
it
because
the
subject
pleased
them
they
passed
carelessly
by
the
masterpieces
of
rembrandt
and
van
der
helst
and
went
into
raptures
over
an
ugly
picture
by
van
der
venne
representing
a
sea
fight
between
the
dutch
and
english
they
also
stood
spellbound
before
a
painting
of
two
little
urchins
one
of
whom
was
taking
soup
and
the
other
eating
an
egg
the
principal
merit
in
this
work
was
that
the
young
had
kindly
slobbered
his
face
with
the
yolk
for
their
entertainment
an
excellent
representation
of
the
feast
of
saint
nicholas
next
had
the
honor
of
attracting
them
look
van
mounen
said
ben
to
lambert
could
anything
be
better
than
this
youngster
s
face
he
looks
as
if
he
knows
he
deserves
a
whipping
but
hopes
saint
nicholas
may
not
have
found
him
out
that
s
the
kind
of
painting
i
like
something
that
tells
a
come
boys
cried
the
captain
ten
o
clock
time
we
were
off
they
hastened
to
the
canal
skates
on
are
you
ready
one
two
halloo
where
s
poot
sure
enough
where
was
poot
a
square
opening
had
just
been
cut
in
the
ice
not
ten
yards
off
peter
observed
it
and
without
a
word
skated
rapidly
toward
it
all
the
others
followed
of
course
peter
looked
in
they
all
looked
in
then
stared
anxiously
at
each
other
poot
screamed
peter
peering
into
the
hole
again
all
was
still
the
black
water
gave
no
sign
it
was
already
glazing
on
top
van
mounen
turned
mysteriously
to
ben
didn
t
he
have
a
fit
once
my
goodness
yes
answered
ben
in
a
great
fright
then
depend
upon
it
he
s
been
taken
with
one
in
the
museum
the
boys
caught
his
meaning
every
skate
was
off
in
a
twinkling
peter
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
scoop
up
a
capful
of
water
from
the
hole
and
off
they
scampered
to
the
rescue
alas
they
did
indeed
find
poor
jacob
in
a
fit
but
it
was
a
fit
of
sleepiness
there
he
lay
in
a
recess
of
the
gallery
snoring
like
a
trooper
the
chorus
of
laughter
that
followed
this
discovery
brought
an
angry
official
to
the
spot
what
now
none
of
this
racket
here
you
beer
barrel
wake
up
and
master
jacob
received
a
very
unceremonious
shaking
as
soon
as
peter
saw
that
jacob
s
condition
was
not
serious
he
hastened
to
the
street
to
empty
his
unfortunate
cap
while
he
was
stuffing
in
his
handkerchief
to
prevent
the
already
frozen
crown
from
touching
his
head
the
rest
of
the
boys
came
down
dragging
the
bewildered
and
indignant
jacob
in
their
midst
the
order
to
start
was
again
given
master
poot
was
at
last
the
ice
was
a
little
rough
and
broken
just
there
but
every
boy
was
in
high
spirits
shall
we
go
on
by
the
canal
or
the
river
asked
peter
oh
the
river
by
all
means
said
carl
it
will
be
such
fun
they
say
it
is
perfect
skating
all
the
way
but
it
s
much
jacob
poot
instantly
became
interested
i
vote
for
the
canal
he
cried
well
the
canal
it
shall
be
responded
the
captain
if
all
are
agreed
they
echoed
in
rather
a
disappointed
tone
and
captain
peter
led
the
way
all
right
come
on
we
can
reach
haarlem
in
an
hour
big
manias
and
little
oddities
while
skating
along
at
full
speed
they
heard
the
cars
from
amsterdam
coming
close
behind
them
halloo
cried
ludwig
glancing
toward
the
rail
track
who
can
t
beat
a
locomotive
let
s
give
it
a
race
the
whistle
screamed
at
the
very
idea
so
did
the
boys
and
at
it
they
went
for
an
instant
the
boys
were
ahead
hurrahing
with
all
their
might
only
for
an
instant
but
even
that
was
something
this
excitement
over
they
began
to
travel
more
leisurely
and
indulge
in
conversation
and
frolic
sometimes
they
stopped
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
guards
who
were
stationed
at
certain
distances
along
the
canal
these
men
in
winter
attend
to
keeping
the
surface
free
from
obstruction
and
garbage
after
a
snowstorm
they
are
expected
to
sweep
the
feathery
covering
away
before
it
hardens
into
a
marble
pretty
to
look
at
but
very
unwelcome
to
skaters
now
and
then
the
boys
so
far
forgot
their
dignity
as
to
clamber
among
the
icebound
canal
boats
crowded
together
in
a
widened
harbor
off
the
canal
but
the
watchful
guards
would
soon
spy
them
out
and
order
them
down
with
a
growl
nothing
could
be
straighter
than
the
canal
upon
which
our
party
were
skating
and
nothing
straighter
than
the
long
rows
of
willow
trees
that
stood
bare
and
wispy
along
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
lifted
high
above
the
surrounding
country
lay
the
carriage
road
on
top
of
the
great
dike
built
to
keep
the
haarlem
lake
within
bounds
stretching
out
far
in
the
distance
until
it
became
lost
in
a
point
was
the
glassy
canal
with
its
many
skaters
its
iceboats
its
and
its
queer
little
sleds
light
as
cork
flying
over
the
ice
by
means
of
sticks
in
the
hands
of
the
riders
ben
was
in
ecstasy
with
the
scene
ludwig
van
holp
had
been
thinking
how
strange
it
was
that
the
english
boy
should
know
so
much
of
holland
according
to
lambert
s
account
he
knew
more
about
it
than
the
dutch
did
this
did
not
quite
please
our
young
hollander
suddenly
he
thought
of
something
that
he
believed
would
make
the
shon
pull
open
his
eyes
he
drew
near
lambert
with
a
triumphant
tell
him
about
the
tulips
ben
caught
the
word
tulpen
oh
yes
said
he
eagerly
in
english
the
tulip
mania
are
you
speaking
of
that
i
have
often
heard
it
mentioned
but
know
very
little
about
it
it
reached
its
height
in
amsterdam
didn
t
it
ludwig
moaned
the
words
were
hard
to
understand
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
enlightened
expression
on
ben
s
face
lambert
happily
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
young
countryman
s
distress
as
he
replied
yes
here
and
in
haarlem
principally
but
the
excitement
ran
high
all
over
holland
and
in
england
too
for
that
hardly
in
england
i
think
said
ben
but
i
am
not
sure
as
i
was
not
thereat
the
although
the
tulip
mania
did
not
prevail
in
england
as
in
holland
the
flower
soon
became
an
object
of
speculation
and
brought
very
large
prices
in
tulips
were
publicly
sold
on
the
exchange
of
london
even
as
late
as
a
common
price
was
fifteen
guineas
for
one
bulb
ben
did
not
know
that
in
his
own
day
a
single
tulip
plant
called
the
fanny
kemble
had
been
sold
in
london
for
more
than
seventy
guineas
mr
mackay
in
his
memoirs
of
popular
delusions
tells
a
funny
story
of
an
english
botanist
who
happened
to
see
a
tulip
bulb
lying
in
the
conservatory
of
a
wealthy
dutchman
ignorant
if
its
value
he
took
out
his
penknife
and
cutting
the
bulb
in
two
became
very
much
interested
in
his
investigations
suddenly
the
owner
appeared
and
pouncing
furiously
upon
him
asked
if
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
peeling
a
most
extraordinary
onion
replied
the
philosopher
hundert
tousant
tuyvel
shouted
the
dutchman
it
s
an
admiral
van
der
eyk
thank
you
replied
the
traveler
immediately
writing
the
name
in
his
notebook
pray
are
these
very
common
in
your
country
death
and
the
tuyvel
screamed
the
dutchman
come
before
the
syndic
and
you
shall
see
in
spite
of
his
struggles
the
poor
investigator
followed
by
an
indignant
mob
was
taken
through
the
streets
to
a
magistrate
soon
he
learned
to
his
dismay
that
he
had
destroyed
a
bulb
worth
florins
he
was
lodged
in
prison
until
securities
could
be
procured
for
the
payment
of
the
sum
ha
ha
that
s
true
unless
you
are
over
two
hundred
years
old
well
i
tell
you
sir
there
never
was
anything
like
it
before
nor
since
why
persons
were
so
crazy
after
tulip
bulbs
in
those
days
that
they
paid
their
weight
in
gold
for
what
the
weight
of
a
man
cried
ben
showing
such
astonishment
in
his
eyes
that
ludwig
fairly
capered
no
no
the
weight
of
a
bulb
the
first
tulip
was
sent
here
from
constantinople
about
the
year
it
was
so
much
admired
that
the
rich
people
of
amsterdam
sent
to
turkey
for
more
from
that
time
they
grew
to
be
the
rage
and
it
lasted
for
years
single
roots
brought
from
one
to
four
thousand
florins
and
one
bulb
the
semper
augustus
brought
that
s
more
than
four
hundred
guineas
of
our
money
interposed
ben
yes
and
i
know
i
m
right
for
i
read
it
in
a
translation
from
beckman
only
day
before
yesterday
well
sir
it
was
great
everyone
speculated
in
tulips
even
bargemen
and
rag
women
and
chimney
sweeps
the
richest
merchants
were
not
ashamed
to
share
the
excitement
people
bought
bulbs
and
sold
them
again
at
a
tremendous
profit
without
ever
seeing
them
it
grew
into
a
kind
of
gambling
some
became
rich
by
it
in
a
few
days
and
some
lost
everything
they
had
land
houses
cattle
and
even
clothing
went
for
tulips
when
people
had
no
ready
money
ladies
sold
their
jewels
and
finery
to
enable
them
to
join
in
the
fun
nothing
else
was
thought
of
at
last
the
interfered
people
began
to
see
what
dunces
they
were
making
of
themselves
and
down
went
the
price
of
tulips
old
tulip
debts
couldn
t
be
collected
creditors
went
to
law
and
the
law
turned
its
back
upon
them
debts
made
in
gambling
were
not
binding
it
said
then
there
was
a
time
thousands
of
rich
speculators
were
reduced
to
beggary
in
an
hour
as
old
beckman
says
the
bubble
was
burst
at
yes
and
a
big
bubble
it
was
said
ben
who
had
listened
with
great
interest
by
the
way
did
you
know
that
the
name
tulip
came
from
a
turkish
word
signifying
turban
i
had
forgotten
that
answered
lambert
but
it
s
a
capital
idea
just
fancy
a
party
of
turks
in
full
headgear
squatted
upon
a
lawn
perfect
tulip
bed
ha
ha
capital
idea
there
groaned
ludwig
to
himself
he
s
been
telling
lambert
something
wonderful
about
tulips
i
knew
it
the
fact
is
continued
lambert
you
can
conjure
up
quite
a
human
picture
of
a
tulip
bed
in
bloom
especially
when
it
is
nodding
and
bobbing
in
the
wind
did
you
ever
notice
it
not
i
it
strikes
me
van
mounen
that
you
hollanders
are
prodigiously
fond
of
the
flower
to
this
certainly
you
can
t
have
a
garden
without
them
prettiest
flower
that
grows
i
think
my
uncle
has
a
magnificent
bed
of
the
finest
varieties
at
his
summer
house
on
the
other
side
of
i
thought
your
uncle
lived
in
the
city
so
he
does
but
his
summer
house
or
pavilion
is
a
few
miles
off
he
has
another
one
built
out
over
the
river
we
passed
near
it
when
we
entered
the
city
everybody
in
amsterdam
has
a
pavilion
somewhere
if
he
do
they
ever
live
there
asked
ben
bless
you
no
they
are
small
affairs
suitable
only
to
spend
a
few
hours
in
on
summer
afternoons
there
are
some
beautiful
ones
on
the
southern
end
of
the
haarlem
lake
now
that
they
ve
commenced
to
drain
it
into
polders
it
will
spoil
that
fun
by
the
way
we
ve
passed
some
ones
since
we
left
home
you
noticed
them
i
suppose
with
their
little
bridges
and
ponds
and
gardens
and
their
mottoes
over
the
ben
nodded
they
make
but
little
show
now
continued
lambert
but
in
warm
weather
they
are
delightful
after
the
willows
sprout
uncle
goes
to
his
summer
house
every
afternoon
he
dozes
and
smokes
aunt
knits
with
her
feet
perched
upon
a
foot
stove
never
mind
how
hot
the
day
my
cousin
rika
and
the
other
girls
fish
in
the
lake
from
the
windows
or
chat
with
their
friends
rowing
by
and
the
youngsters
tumble
about
or
hang
upon
the
little
bridges
over
the
ditch
then
they
have
coffee
and
cakes
beside
a
great
bunch
of
water
lilies
on
the
table
it
s
very
fine
i
can
tell
you
only
between
ourselves
though
i
was
born
here
i
shall
never
fancy
the
odor
of
stagnant
water
that
hangs
about
most
of
the
summer
houses
nearly
every
one
you
see
is
built
over
a
ditch
probably
i
feel
it
more
from
having
lived
so
long
in
perhaps
i
shall
notice
it
too
said
ben
if
a
thaw
comes
the
early
winter
has
covered
up
the
fragrant
waters
for
my
benefit
much
obliged
to
it
holland
without
this
glorious
skating
wouldn
t
be
the
same
thing
at
how
very
different
you
are
from
the
poots
exclaimed
lambert
who
had
been
listening
in
a
sort
of
brown
study
and
yet
you
are
cousins
i
can
not
understand
we
are
cousins
or
rather
we
have
always
considered
ourselves
such
but
the
relationship
is
not
very
close
our
grandmothers
were
my
side
of
the
family
is
entirely
english
while
he
is
entirely
dutch
old
poot
married
twice
you
see
and
i
am
a
descendant
of
his
english
wife
i
like
jacob
though
better
than
half
of
my
english
cousins
put
together
he
is
the
boy
i
ever
knew
strange
as
you
may
think
it
my
father
became
accidentally
acquainted
with
jacob
s
father
while
on
a
business
visit
to
rotterdam
they
soon
talked
over
their
relationship
in
french
by
the
way
and
they
have
corresponded
in
the
language
ever
since
queer
things
come
about
in
this
world
my
sister
jenny
would
open
her
eyes
at
some
of
aunt
poot
s
ways
aunt
is
a
thorough
lady
but
so
different
from
mother
and
the
house
too
and
furniture
and
way
of
living
everything
is
of
course
assented
lambert
complacently
as
if
to
say
you
could
scarcely
expect
such
general
perfection
anywhere
else
than
in
holland
but
you
will
have
all
the
more
to
tell
jenny
when
you
go
yes
indeed
i
can
say
one
thing
if
cleanliness
is
as
they
claim
next
to
godliness
broek
is
safe
it
is
the
cleanest
place
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
why
my
aunt
poot
rich
as
she
is
scrubs
half
the
time
and
her
house
looks
as
if
it
were
varnished
all
over
i
wrote
to
mother
yesterday
that
i
could
see
my
double
always
with
me
feet
to
feet
in
the
polished
floor
of
the
dining
your
double
that
word
puzzles
me
what
do
you
mean
oh
my
reflection
my
apparition
ben
dobbs
number
ah
i
see
exclaimed
van
mounen
have
you
ever
been
in
your
aunt
poot
s
grand
parlor
ben
laughed
only
once
and
that
was
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
jacob
says
i
shall
have
no
chance
of
entering
it
again
until
the
time
of
his
sister
kanau
s
wedding
the
week
after
christmas
father
has
consented
that
i
shall
remain
to
witness
the
great
event
every
saturday
aunt
poot
and
her
fat
kate
go
into
that
parlor
and
sweep
and
polish
and
scrub
then
it
is
darkened
and
closed
until
saturday
comes
again
not
a
soul
enters
it
in
the
meantime
but
the
schoonmaken
as
she
calls
it
must
be
done
just
the
that
is
nothing
every
parlor
in
broek
meets
with
the
same
treatment
said
lambert
what
do
you
think
of
those
moving
figures
in
her
neighbor
s
garden
oh
they
re
well
enough
the
swans
must
seem
really
alive
gliding
about
the
pond
in
summer
but
that
nodding
mandarin
in
the
corner
under
the
chestnut
trees
is
ridiculous
only
fit
for
children
to
laugh
at
and
then
the
stiff
garden
patches
and
the
trees
all
trimmed
and
painted
excuse
me
van
mounen
but
i
shall
never
learn
to
admire
dutch
it
will
take
time
answered
lambert
condescendingly
but
you
are
sure
to
agree
with
it
at
last
i
saw
much
to
admire
in
england
and
i
hope
i
shall
be
sent
back
with
you
to
study
at
oxford
but
take
everything
together
i
like
holland
of
course
you
do
said
ben
in
a
tone
of
hearty
approval
you
wouldn
t
be
a
good
hollander
if
you
didn
t
nothing
like
loving
one
s
country
it
is
strange
though
to
have
such
a
warm
feeling
for
such
a
cold
place
if
we
were
not
exercising
all
the
time
we
should
freeze
lambert
laughed
that
s
your
english
blood
benjamin
i
m
not
cold
and
look
at
the
skaters
here
on
the
canal
they
re
red
as
roses
and
happy
as
lords
halloo
good
captain
van
holp
called
out
lambert
in
dutch
what
say
you
to
stopping
at
yonder
farmhouse
and
warming
our
toes
who
is
cold
asked
peter
turning
around
benjamin
benjamin
dobbs
shall
be
warmed
and
the
party
was
brought
to
a
halt
on
the
way
to
haarlem
on
approaching
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
the
boys
suddenly
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
lively
domestic
scene
a
burly
dutchman
came
rushing
out
closely
followed
by
his
dear
vrouw
and
she
was
beating
him
smartly
with
her
warming
pan
the
expression
on
her
face
gave
our
boys
so
little
promise
of
a
kind
reception
that
they
prudently
resolved
to
carry
their
toes
elsewhere
to
be
warmed
the
next
cottage
proved
to
be
more
inviting
its
low
roof
of
bright
red
tiles
extended
over
the
cow
stable
that
clean
as
could
be
nestled
close
to
the
main
building
a
neat
old
woman
sat
at
one
window
knitting
at
the
other
could
be
discerned
part
of
the
profile
of
a
fat
figure
that
pipe
in
mouth
sat
behind
the
shining
little
panes
and
snowy
curtain
in
answer
to
peter
s
subdued
knock
a
lass
in
holiday
attire
opened
the
upper
half
of
the
green
door
which
was
divided
across
the
middle
and
inquired
their
errand
may
we
enter
and
warm
ourselves
jufvrouw
asked
the
captain
respectfully
yes
and
welcome
was
the
reply
as
the
lower
half
of
the
door
swung
softly
toward
its
mate
every
boy
before
entering
rubbed
long
and
faithfully
upon
the
rough
mat
and
each
made
his
best
bow
to
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
at
the
window
ben
was
half
inclined
to
think
that
these
personages
were
automata
like
the
moving
figures
in
the
garden
at
broek
for
they
both
nodded
their
heads
slowly
in
precisely
the
same
way
and
both
went
on
with
their
employment
as
steadily
and
stiffly
as
though
they
worked
by
machinery
the
old
man
puffed
puffed
and
his
vrouw
clicked
her
knitting
needles
as
if
regulated
by
internal
cog
wheels
even
the
real
smoke
issuing
from
the
motionless
pipe
gave
no
convincing
proof
that
they
were
human
but
the
maiden
ah
how
she
bustled
about
how
she
gave
the
boys
polished
chairs
to
sit
upon
how
she
made
the
fire
blaze
as
if
it
were
inspired
how
she
made
jacob
poot
almost
weep
for
joy
by
bringing
forth
a
great
square
of
gingerbread
and
a
stone
jug
of
sour
wine
how
she
laughed
and
nodded
as
the
boys
ate
like
wild
animals
on
good
behavior
and
how
blank
she
looked
when
ben
politely
but
firmly
refused
to
take
any
black
bread
and
sauerkraut
how
she
pulled
off
jacob
s
mitten
which
was
torn
at
the
thumb
and
mended
it
before
his
eyes
biting
off
the
thread
with
her
whit
teeth
and
saying
now
it
will
be
warmer
as
she
bit
and
finally
how
she
shook
hands
with
every
boy
in
turn
and
throwing
a
deprecating
glance
at
the
female
automaton
insisted
upon
filling
their
pockets
with
gingerbread
all
this
time
the
knitting
needles
clicked
on
and
the
pipe
never
missed
a
puff
when
the
boys
were
fairly
on
their
way
again
they
came
in
sight
of
the
zwanenburg
castle
with
its
massive
stone
front
and
its
gateway
towers
each
surmounted
with
a
sculptured
swan
halfweg
halfway
boys
said
peter
off
with
your
you
see
explained
lambert
to
his
companions
the
y
and
the
haarlem
lake
meeting
here
make
it
rather
troublesome
the
river
is
five
feet
higher
than
the
land
so
we
must
have
everything
strong
in
the
way
of
dikes
and
sluice
gates
or
there
would
be
wet
work
at
once
the
sluice
arrangements
are
supposed
to
be
something
extra
we
will
walk
over
them
and
you
shall
see
enough
to
make
you
open
your
eyes
the
spring
water
of
the
lake
they
say
has
the
most
wonderful
bleaching
powers
of
any
in
the
world
all
the
great
haarlem
bleacheries
use
it
i
can
t
say
much
upon
that
subject
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
from
personal
what
is
that
why
the
lake
is
full
of
the
biggest
eels
you
ever
saw
i
ve
caught
them
here
often
perfectly
prodigious
i
tell
you
they
re
sometimes
a
match
for
a
fellow
they
d
almost
wriggle
your
arm
from
the
socket
if
you
were
not
on
your
guard
but
you
re
not
interested
in
eels
i
perceive
the
castle
s
a
big
affair
isn
t
it
yes
what
do
those
swans
mean
anything
asked
ben
looking
up
at
the
stone
gate
towers
the
swan
is
held
almost
in
reverence
by
us
hollanders
these
give
the
building
its
name
zwanenburg
swan
castle
that
is
all
i
know
this
is
a
very
important
spot
for
it
is
here
that
the
wise
ones
hold
council
with
regard
to
dike
matters
the
castle
was
once
the
residence
of
the
celebrated
christian
what
about
him
asked
ben
peter
could
answer
you
better
than
i
said
lambert
if
you
could
only
understand
each
other
or
were
not
such
cowards
about
leaving
your
mother
tongues
but
i
have
often
heard
my
grandfather
speak
of
brunings
he
is
never
tired
of
telling
us
of
the
great
engineer
how
good
he
was
and
how
learned
and
how
when
he
died
the
whole
country
seemed
to
mourn
as
for
a
friend
he
belonged
to
a
great
many
learned
societies
and
was
at
the
head
of
the
state
department
intrusted
with
the
care
of
the
dikes
and
other
defences
against
the
sea
there
s
no
counting
the
improvements
he
made
in
dikes
and
sluices
and
water
mills
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
we
hollanders
you
know
consider
our
great
engineers
as
the
highest
of
public
benefactors
brunings
died
years
ago
they
ve
a
monument
to
his
memory
in
the
cathedral
of
haarlem
i
have
seen
his
portrait
and
i
tell
you
ben
he
was
right
no
wonder
the
castle
looks
so
stiff
and
proud
it
is
something
to
have
given
shelter
to
such
a
man
yes
indeed
said
ben
i
wonder
van
mounen
whether
you
or
i
will
ever
give
any
old
building
a
right
to
feel
so
proud
there
s
a
great
deal
to
be
done
yet
in
this
world
and
some
of
us
who
are
boys
now
will
have
to
do
it
look
to
your
shoe
latchet
van
it
s
a
catastrophe
it
was
nearly
one
o
clock
when
captain
van
holp
and
his
command
entered
the
grand
old
city
of
haarlem
they
had
skated
nearly
seventeen
miles
since
morning
and
were
still
as
fresh
as
young
eagles
from
the
youngest
ludwig
van
holp
who
was
just
fourteen
to
the
eldest
no
less
a
personage
than
the
captain
himself
a
veteran
of
seventeen
there
was
but
one
opinion
that
this
was
the
greatest
frolic
of
their
lives
to
be
sure
jacob
poot
had
become
rather
short
of
breath
during
the
last
mile
of
two
and
perhaps
he
felt
ready
for
another
nap
but
there
was
enough
jollity
in
him
yet
for
a
dozen
even
carl
schummel
who
had
become
very
intimate
with
ludwig
during
the
excursion
forgot
to
be
as
for
peter
he
was
the
happiest
of
the
happy
and
had
sung
and
whistled
so
joyously
while
skating
that
the
staidest
passersby
had
smiled
as
they
listened
come
boys
it
s
nearly
tiffin
hour
he
said
as
they
neared
a
coffeehouse
on
the
main
street
we
must
have
something
more
solid
than
the
pretty
maiden
s
gingerbread
and
the
captain
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
as
if
to
say
there
s
money
enough
here
to
feed
an
army
halloo
cried
lambert
what
ails
the
man
peter
pale
and
staring
was
clapping
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
sides
he
looked
like
one
suddenly
becoming
deranged
he
s
sick
cried
ben
no
he
s
lost
something
said
carl
peter
could
only
gasp
the
pocketbook
with
all
our
money
in
it
it
s
gone
for
an
instant
all
were
too
much
startled
to
speak
carl
at
last
came
out
with
a
gruff
no
sense
in
letting
one
fellow
have
all
the
money
i
said
so
from
the
first
look
in
your
other
i
did
it
isn
t
open
your
peter
obeyed
mechanically
he
even
took
off
his
hat
and
looked
into
it
then
thrust
his
hand
desperately
into
every
pocket
it
s
gone
boys
he
said
at
last
in
a
hopeless
tone
no
tiffin
for
us
nor
dinner
either
what
is
to
be
done
we
can
t
get
on
without
money
if
we
were
in
amsterdam
i
could
get
as
much
as
we
want
but
there
is
not
a
man
in
haarlem
from
whom
i
can
borrow
a
stiver
doesn
t
one
of
you
know
anyone
here
who
would
lend
us
a
few
guilders
each
boy
looked
into
five
blank
faces
then
something
like
a
smile
passed
around
the
circle
but
it
got
sadly
knotted
up
when
it
reached
carl
that
wouldn
t
do
he
said
crossly
i
know
some
people
here
rich
ones
too
but
father
would
flog
me
soundly
if
i
borrowed
a
cent
from
anyone
he
has
an
honest
man
need
not
borrow
written
over
the
gateway
of
his
summer
humph
responded
peter
not
particularly
admiring
the
sentiment
just
at
that
moment
the
boys
grew
desperately
hungry
at
once
it
wash
my
fault
said
jacob
in
a
penitent
tone
to
ben
i
say
first
petter
all
de
boys
put
zair
pursh
into
van
holp
s
nonsense
jacob
you
did
it
all
for
the
ben
said
this
in
such
a
sprightly
tone
that
the
two
van
holps
and
carl
felt
sure
that
he
had
proposed
a
plan
that
would
relieve
the
party
at
once
what
what
tell
us
van
mounen
they
cried
he
says
it
is
not
jacob
s
fault
that
the
money
is
lost
that
he
did
it
for
the
best
when
he
proposed
that
van
holp
should
put
all
of
our
money
into
his
is
that
all
said
ludwig
dismally
he
need
not
have
made
such
a
fuss
in
just
saying
that
how
much
money
have
we
lost
don
t
you
remember
said
peter
we
each
put
in
exactly
ten
guilders
the
purse
had
sixty
guilders
in
it
i
am
the
stupidest
fellow
in
the
world
little
schimmelpenninck
would
have
made
you
a
better
captain
i
could
pommel
myself
for
bringing
such
a
disappointment
upon
do
it
then
growled
carl
pooh
he
added
we
all
know
that
it
was
an
accident
but
that
doesn
t
help
matters
we
must
have
money
van
holp
even
if
you
have
to
sell
your
wonderful
sell
my
mother
s
birthday
present
never
i
will
sell
my
coat
my
hat
anything
but
my
come
come
said
jacob
pleasantly
we
are
making
too
much
of
this
affair
we
can
go
home
and
start
again
in
a
day
or
you
may
be
able
to
get
another
piece
said
carl
but
the
rest
of
us
will
not
find
it
so
easy
if
we
go
home
we
stay
home
you
may
our
captain
whose
good
nature
had
not
yet
forsaken
him
for
a
moment
grew
indignant
do
you
think
that
i
will
let
you
suffer
for
my
carelessness
he
exclaimed
i
have
three
times
sixty
guilders
in
my
strong
box
at
home
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
carl
hastily
adding
in
a
surlier
tone
well
i
see
no
better
way
than
to
go
back
i
see
a
better
plan
than
that
said
the
captain
what
is
it
cried
all
the
boys
why
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
and
go
back
pleasantly
and
like
men
said
peter
looking
so
gallant
and
handsome
as
he
turned
his
frank
face
and
clear
blue
eyes
upon
them
that
they
caught
his
spirit
ho
for
the
captain
they
shouted
now
boys
we
may
as
well
make
up
our
minds
there
s
no
place
like
broek
after
all
and
that
we
mean
to
be
there
in
two
hours
is
that
agreed
to
agreed
cried
all
as
they
ran
to
the
canal
on
with
your
skates
are
you
ready
here
jacob
let
me
help
now
one
two
three
start
and
the
boyish
faces
that
left
haarlem
at
that
signal
were
nearly
as
bright
as
those
that
had
entered
it
with
captain
peter
half
an
hour
before
hans
donder
and
blixin
cried
carl
angrily
before
the
party
had
skated
twenty
yards
from
the
city
gates
if
here
isn
t
that
ragamuffin
in
the
patched
leather
breeches
that
fellow
is
everywhere
confound
him
we
ll
be
lucky
he
added
in
as
sneering
a
tone
as
he
dared
to
assume
if
our
captain
doesn
t
order
us
to
halt
and
shake
hands
with
your
captain
is
a
terrible
fellow
said
peter
pleasantly
but
this
is
a
false
alarm
carl
i
can
not
spy
your
bugbear
anywhere
among
the
skaters
ah
there
he
is
why
what
is
the
matter
with
the
lad
poor
hans
his
face
was
pale
his
lips
compressed
he
skated
like
one
under
the
effects
of
a
fearful
dream
just
as
he
was
passing
peter
hailed
him
good
day
hans
brinker
hans
s
countenance
brightened
at
once
ah
mynheer
is
that
you
it
is
well
we
meet
just
like
his
impertinence
hissed
carl
schummel
darting
scornfully
past
his
companions
who
seemed
inclined
to
linger
with
their
captain
i
am
glad
to
see
you
hans
responded
peter
cheerfully
but
you
look
troubled
can
i
serve
you
i
have
a
trouble
mynheer
answered
hans
casting
down
his
eyes
then
lifting
them
again
with
almost
a
happy
expression
he
added
but
it
is
hans
who
can
help
mynheer
van
holp
this
how
asked
peter
making
in
his
blunt
dutch
way
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
surprise
by
giving
you
this
and
hans
held
forth
the
missing
purse
hurrah
shouted
the
boys
taking
their
cold
hands
from
their
pockets
to
wave
them
joyfully
in
the
air
but
peter
said
thank
you
hans
brinker
in
a
tone
that
made
hans
feel
as
if
the
king
had
knelt
to
him
the
shout
of
the
delighted
boys
had
reached
the
muffled
ears
of
the
fine
young
gentleman
who
under
a
full
pressure
of
wrath
was
skating
toward
amsterdam
a
yankee
boy
would
have
wheeled
about
at
once
and
hastened
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
but
carl
only
halted
and
with
his
back
toward
his
party
wondered
what
on
earth
had
happened
there
he
stood
immovable
until
feeling
sure
that
nothing
but
the
prospect
of
something
to
eat
could
have
made
them
hurrah
so
heartily
he
turned
and
skated
slowly
toward
his
excited
comrades
in
the
meantime
peter
had
drawn
hans
aside
from
the
rest
how
did
you
know
it
was
my
purse
he
asked
you
paid
me
three
guilders
yesterday
mynheer
for
making
the
whitewood
chain
telling
me
that
i
must
buy
yes
i
i
saw
your
purse
then
it
was
of
yellow
and
where
did
you
find
it
today
i
left
my
home
this
morning
mynheer
in
great
trouble
and
as
i
skated
i
took
no
heed
until
i
stumbled
against
some
lumber
and
while
i
was
rubbing
my
knee
i
saw
your
purse
nearly
hidden
under
a
that
place
ah
i
remember
now
just
as
we
were
passing
it
i
pulled
my
tippet
from
my
pocket
and
probably
flipped
out
the
purse
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
been
gone
but
for
you
hans
here
pouring
out
the
contents
you
must
give
us
the
pleasure
of
dividing
the
money
with
no
mynheer
answered
hans
he
spoke
quietly
without
pretence
or
any
grace
of
manner
but
peter
somehow
felt
rebuked
and
put
the
silver
back
without
a
word
i
like
that
boy
rich
or
poor
he
thought
to
himself
then
added
aloud
may
i
ask
about
this
trouble
of
yours
hans
ah
mynheer
it
is
a
sad
case
but
i
have
waited
here
too
long
i
am
going
to
leyden
to
see
the
great
dr
boekman
exclaimed
peter
in
astonishment
yes
mynheer
and
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
good
day
stay
i
am
going
that
way
come
my
lads
shall
we
return
to
haarlem
yes
cried
the
boys
eagerly
and
off
they
started
now
said
peter
drawing
near
hans
both
skimming
the
ice
so
easily
and
lightly
as
they
skated
on
together
that
they
seemed
scarcely
conscious
of
moving
we
are
going
to
stop
at
leyden
and
if
you
are
going
there
only
with
a
message
to
boekman
can
not
i
do
the
errand
for
you
the
boys
may
be
too
tired
to
skate
so
far
today
but
i
will
promise
to
see
him
early
tomorrow
if
he
is
to
be
found
in
the
ah
mynheer
that
would
be
serving
me
indeed
it
is
not
the
distance
i
dread
but
leaving
my
mother
so
is
she
ill
no
mynheer
it
is
the
father
you
may
have
heard
it
how
he
has
been
without
wit
for
many
a
year
ever
since
the
great
schlossen
mill
was
built
but
his
body
has
been
well
and
strong
last
night
the
mother
knelt
upon
the
hearth
to
blow
the
peat
it
is
his
only
delight
to
sit
and
watch
the
live
embers
and
she
will
blow
them
into
a
blaze
every
hour
of
the
day
to
please
him
before
she
could
stir
he
sprang
upon
her
like
a
giant
and
held
her
close
to
the
fire
all
the
time
laughing
and
shaking
his
head
i
was
on
the
canal
but
i
heard
the
mother
scream
and
ran
to
her
the
father
had
never
loosened
his
hold
and
her
gown
was
smoking
i
tried
to
deaden
the
fire
but
with
one
hand
he
pushed
me
off
there
was
no
water
in
the
cottage
or
i
could
have
done
better
and
all
that
time
he
laughed
such
a
terrible
laugh
mynheer
hardly
a
sound
but
all
in
his
face
i
tried
to
pull
her
away
but
that
only
made
it
worse
then
it
was
dreadful
but
could
i
see
the
mother
burn
i
beat
him
beat
him
with
a
stool
he
tossed
me
away
the
gown
was
on
i
would
put
it
out
i
can
t
remember
well
after
that
i
found
myself
upon
the
floor
and
the
mother
was
praying
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
in
a
blaze
and
all
the
while
i
could
hear
that
laugh
gretel
flew
to
the
closet
and
filled
a
porringer
with
the
food
he
liked
and
put
it
upon
the
floor
then
mynheer
he
left
the
mother
and
crawled
to
it
like
a
little
child
she
was
not
burned
only
a
part
of
her
clothing
ah
how
kind
she
was
to
him
all
night
watching
and
tending
him
he
slept
in
a
high
fever
with
his
hands
pressed
to
his
head
the
mother
says
he
has
done
that
so
much
of
late
as
though
he
felt
pain
there
ah
mynheer
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
if
the
father
was
himself
he
would
not
harm
even
a
for
a
moment
the
two
boys
moved
on
in
silence
it
is
terrible
said
peter
at
last
how
is
he
today
very
sick
why
go
for
boekman
hans
there
are
others
in
amsterdam
who
could
help
him
perhaps
boekman
is
a
famous
man
sought
only
by
the
wealthiest
and
they
often
wait
upon
him
in
he
promised
mynheer
he
promised
me
yesterday
to
come
to
the
father
in
a
week
but
now
that
the
change
has
come
we
can
not
wait
we
think
the
poor
father
is
dying
oh
mynheer
you
can
plead
with
him
to
come
quick
he
will
not
wait
a
whole
week
and
our
father
dying
the
good
meester
is
so
so
kind
echoed
peter
in
astonishment
why
he
is
known
as
the
crossest
man
in
holland
he
looks
so
because
he
has
no
fat
and
his
head
is
busy
but
his
heart
is
kind
i
know
tell
the
meester
what
i
have
told
you
mynheer
and
he
will
i
hope
so
hans
with
all
my
heart
you
are
in
haste
to
turn
homeward
i
see
promise
me
that
should
you
need
a
friend
you
will
go
to
my
mother
in
broek
tell
her
i
bade
you
see
her
and
hans
brinker
not
as
a
reward
but
as
a
gift
take
a
few
of
these
hans
shook
his
head
resolutely
no
no
mynheer
i
can
not
take
it
if
i
could
find
work
in
broek
or
at
the
south
mill
i
would
be
glad
but
it
is
the
same
story
everywhere
wait
until
spring
it
is
well
you
speak
of
it
said
peter
eagerly
for
my
father
needs
help
at
once
your
pretty
chain
pleased
him
much
he
said
that
boy
has
a
clean
cut
he
would
be
good
at
there
is
to
be
a
carved
portal
to
our
new
summer
house
and
father
will
pay
well
for
the
god
is
good
cried
hans
in
sudden
delight
oh
mynheer
that
would
be
too
much
joy
i
have
never
tried
big
work
but
i
can
do
it
i
know
i
well
tell
my
father
you
are
the
hans
brinker
of
whom
i
spoke
he
will
be
glad
to
serve
hans
stared
in
honest
surprise
thank
you
now
captain
shouted
carl
anxious
to
appear
as
good
humored
as
possible
by
way
of
atonement
here
we
are
in
the
midst
of
haarlem
and
no
word
from
you
yet
we
await
your
orders
and
we
re
as
hungry
as
peter
made
a
cheerful
answer
and
turned
hurriedly
to
hans
come
get
something
to
eat
and
i
will
detain
you
no
what
a
quick
wistful
look
hans
threw
upon
him
peter
wondered
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
that
the
poor
boy
was
hungry
ah
mynheer
even
now
the
mother
may
need
me
the
father
may
be
worse
i
must
not
wait
may
god
care
for
and
nodding
hastily
hans
turned
his
face
homeward
and
was
gone
come
boys
sighed
peter
now
for
our
tiffin
homes
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
our
young
dutchmen
had
already
forgotten
the
great
skating
race
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
twentieth
on
the
contrary
they
had
thought
and
spoken
of
it
very
often
during
the
day
even
ben
though
he
had
felt
more
like
a
traveler
than
the
rest
had
never
once
through
all
the
lost
a
certain
vision
of
silver
skates
which
for
a
week
past
had
haunted
him
night
and
day
like
a
true
john
bull
as
jacob
had
called
him
he
never
doubted
that
his
english
fleetness
english
strength
english
everything
could
at
any
time
enable
him
on
the
ice
to
put
all
holland
to
shame
and
the
rest
of
the
world
too
for
that
matter
ben
certainly
was
a
superb
skater
he
had
enjoyed
not
half
the
opportunities
for
practicing
that
had
fallen
to
his
new
comrades
but
he
had
improved
his
share
to
the
utmost
and
was
besides
so
strong
of
frame
so
supple
of
limb
in
short
such
a
tight
trim
quick
graceful
fellow
in
every
way
that
he
had
taken
to
skating
as
naturally
as
a
chamois
to
leaping
or
an
eagle
to
soaring
only
to
the
heavy
heart
of
poor
hans
had
the
vision
of
the
silver
skates
failed
to
appear
during
that
starry
winter
night
and
the
brighter
sunlit
day
even
gretel
had
seen
them
flitting
before
her
as
she
sat
beside
her
mother
through
those
hours
of
weary
watching
not
as
prizes
to
be
won
but
as
treasures
passing
hopelessly
beyond
her
reach
rychie
hilda
and
katrinka
why
they
had
scarcely
known
any
other
thought
than
the
race
the
race
it
will
come
off
on
the
twentieth
these
three
girls
were
friends
though
of
nearly
the
same
age
talent
and
station
they
were
as
different
as
girls
could
be
hilda
van
gleck
as
you
already
know
was
a
noble
girl
of
fourteen
rychie
korbes
was
beautiful
to
look
upon
far
more
sparkling
and
pretty
than
hilda
but
not
half
so
bright
and
sunny
within
clouds
of
pride
of
discontent
and
envy
had
already
gathered
in
her
heart
and
were
growing
bigger
and
darker
every
day
of
course
these
often
relieved
themselves
very
much
after
the
manner
of
other
clouds
but
who
saw
the
storms
and
the
weeping
only
her
maid
or
her
father
mother
and
little
brother
those
who
loved
her
better
than
all
like
other
clouds
too
hers
often
took
queer
shapes
and
what
was
really
but
mist
and
vapory
fancy
assumed
the
appearance
of
monster
wrongs
and
mountains
of
difficulty
to
her
mind
the
poor
peasant
girl
gretel
was
not
a
human
being
a
creature
like
herself
she
was
only
something
that
meant
poverty
rags
and
dirt
such
as
gretel
had
no
right
to
feel
to
hope
above
all
they
should
never
cross
the
paths
of
their
betters
that
is
not
in
a
disagreeable
way
they
could
toil
and
labor
for
them
at
a
respectful
distance
even
admire
them
if
they
would
do
it
humbly
but
nothing
more
if
they
rebel
put
them
down
if
they
suffer
don
t
trouble
me
about
it
was
rychie
s
secret
motto
and
yet
how
witty
she
was
how
tastefully
she
dressed
how
charmingly
she
sang
how
much
feeling
she
displayed
for
pet
kittens
and
rabbits
and
how
completely
she
could
bewitch
sensible
lads
like
lambert
van
mounen
and
ludwig
van
holp
carl
was
too
much
like
her
within
to
be
an
earnest
admirer
and
perhaps
he
suspected
the
clouds
he
being
deep
and
surly
and
always
uncomfortably
in
earnest
of
course
preferred
the
lively
katrinka
whose
nature
was
made
of
a
hundred
tinkling
bells
she
was
a
coquette
in
her
infancy
a
coquette
in
her
childhood
and
now
a
coquette
in
her
school
days
without
a
thought
of
harm
she
coquetted
with
her
studies
her
duties
even
her
little
troubles
she
coquetted
with
her
mother
her
pet
lamb
her
baby
brother
even
with
her
own
golden
curls
tossing
them
back
as
if
she
despised
them
everyone
liked
her
but
who
could
love
her
she
was
never
in
earnest
a
pleasant
face
a
pleasant
heart
a
pleasant
manner
these
satisfy
for
an
hour
poor
happy
katrinka
she
tinkled
tinkled
so
merrily
through
their
early
days
but
life
is
so
apt
to
coquette
with
them
in
turn
to
put
all
their
sweet
bells
out
of
tune
or
to
silence
them
one
by
one
how
different
were
the
homes
of
these
three
girls
from
the
tumbling
old
cottage
where
gretel
dwelt
rychie
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
near
amsterdam
where
the
carved
sideboards
were
laden
with
services
of
silver
and
gold
and
where
silken
tapestries
hung
in
folds
from
ceiling
to
floor
hilda
s
father
owned
the
largest
mansion
in
broek
its
glittering
roof
of
polished
tiles
and
its
boarded
front
painted
in
half
a
dozen
various
colors
were
the
admiration
of
the
neighborhood
katrinka
s
home
not
a
mile
distant
was
the
finest
of
dutch
country
seats
the
garden
was
so
stiffly
laid
out
in
little
paths
and
patches
that
the
birds
might
have
mistaken
it
for
a
great
chinese
puzzle
with
all
the
pieces
spread
out
ready
for
use
but
in
summer
it
was
beautiful
the
flowers
made
the
best
of
their
stiff
quarters
and
when
the
gardener
was
not
watching
glowed
and
bent
about
each
other
in
the
prettiest
way
imaginable
such
a
tulip
bed
why
the
queen
of
the
fairies
would
never
care
for
a
grander
city
in
which
to
hold
her
court
but
katrinka
preferred
the
bed
of
pink
and
white
hyacinths
she
loved
their
freshness
and
fragrance
and
the
lighthearted
way
in
which
their
blossoms
swung
in
the
breeze
carl
was
both
right
and
wrong
when
he
said
that
katrinka
and
rychie
were
furious
at
the
very
idea
of
the
peasant
gretel
joining
in
the
race
he
had
heard
rychie
declare
that
it
was
disgraceful
shameful
too
bad
which
in
dutch
as
in
english
is
generally
the
strongest
expression
an
indignant
girl
can
use
and
he
had
seen
katrinka
nod
her
pretty
head
and
heard
her
sweetly
echo
shameful
too
bad
as
nearly
like
rychie
as
tinkling
bells
can
be
like
the
voice
of
real
anger
this
had
satisfied
him
he
never
suspected
that
had
hilda
not
rychie
first
talked
with
katrinka
upon
the
subject
the
bells
would
have
jingled
as
willing
an
echo
she
would
have
said
certainly
let
her
join
us
and
would
have
skipped
off
thinking
no
more
about
it
but
now
katrinka
with
sweet
emphasis
pronounced
it
a
shame
that
a
a
forlorn
little
creature
like
gretel
should
be
allowed
to
spoil
the
race
rychie
korbes
being
rich
and
powerful
in
a
schoolgirl
way
had
other
followers
besides
katrinka
who
were
induced
to
share
her
opinions
because
they
were
either
too
careless
or
too
cowardly
to
think
for
themselves
poor
little
gretel
her
home
was
sad
and
dark
enough
now
raff
brinker
lay
moaning
upon
his
rough
bed
and
his
vrouw
forgetting
and
forgiving
everything
bathed
his
forehead
his
lips
weeping
and
praying
that
he
might
not
die
hans
as
we
know
had
started
in
desperation
for
leyden
to
search
for
boekman
and
induce
him
if
possible
to
come
to
their
father
at
once
gretel
filled
with
a
strange
dread
had
done
the
work
as
well
as
she
could
wiped
the
rough
brick
floor
brought
peat
to
build
up
the
slow
fire
and
melted
ice
for
her
mother
s
use
this
accomplished
she
seated
herself
upon
a
low
stool
near
the
bed
and
begged
her
mother
to
try
to
sleep
awhile
you
are
so
tired
she
whispered
not
once
have
you
closed
your
eyes
since
that
dreadful
hour
last
night
see
i
have
straightened
the
willow
bed
in
the
corner
and
spread
everything
soft
upon
it
i
could
find
so
that
the
mother
might
lie
in
comfort
here
is
your
jacket
take
off
that
pretty
dress
i
ll
fold
it
away
very
carefully
and
put
it
in
the
big
chest
before
you
go
to
dame
brinker
shook
her
head
without
turning
her
eyes
from
her
husband
s
face
i
can
watch
mother
urged
gretel
and
i
ll
wake
you
every
time
the
father
stirs
you
are
so
pale
and
your
eyes
are
so
red
oh
mother
do
the
child
pleaded
in
vain
dame
brinker
would
not
leave
her
post
gretel
looked
at
her
in
troubled
silence
wondering
whether
it
were
very
wicked
to
care
more
for
one
parent
than
for
the
other
and
sure
yes
quite
sure
that
she
dreaded
her
father
while
she
clung
to
her
mother
with
a
love
that
was
almost
idolatry
hans
loves
the
father
so
well
she
thought
why
can
not
i
yet
i
could
not
help
crying
when
i
saw
his
hand
bleed
that
day
last
month
when
he
snatched
the
knife
and
now
when
he
moans
how
i
ache
ache
all
over
perhaps
i
love
him
after
all
and
god
will
see
that
i
am
not
such
a
bad
wicked
girl
as
i
thought
yes
i
love
the
poor
father
almost
as
hans
does
not
quite
for
hans
is
stronger
and
does
not
fear
him
oh
will
that
moaning
go
on
forever
and
ever
poor
mother
how
patient
she
is
she
never
pouts
as
i
do
about
the
money
that
went
away
so
strangely
if
he
only
could
for
one
instant
open
his
eyes
and
look
at
us
as
hans
does
and
tell
us
where
mother
s
guilders
went
i
would
not
care
for
the
rest
yes
i
would
care
i
don
t
want
the
poor
father
to
die
to
be
all
blue
and
cold
like
annie
bouman
s
little
sister
i
know
i
don
t
dear
god
i
don
t
want
father
to
die
her
thoughts
merged
into
a
prayer
when
it
ended
the
poor
child
scarcely
knew
soon
she
found
herself
watching
a
little
pulse
of
light
at
the
side
of
the
fire
beating
faintly
but
steadily
showing
that
somewhere
in
the
dark
pile
there
was
warmth
and
light
that
would
overspread
it
at
last
a
large
earthen
cup
filled
with
burning
peat
stood
near
the
bedside
gretel
had
placed
it
there
to
stop
the
father
s
shivering
she
said
she
watched
it
as
it
sent
a
glow
around
the
mother
s
form
tipping
her
faded
skirt
with
light
and
shedding
a
sort
of
newness
over
the
threadbare
bodice
it
was
a
relief
to
gretel
to
see
the
lines
in
that
weary
face
soften
as
the
firelight
flickered
gently
across
it
next
she
counted
the
windowpanes
broken
and
patched
as
they
were
and
finally
after
tracing
every
crack
and
seam
in
the
walls
fixed
her
gaze
upon
a
carved
shelf
made
by
hans
the
shelf
hung
as
high
as
gretel
could
reach
it
held
a
large
bible
with
brass
clasps
a
wedding
present
to
dame
brinker
from
the
family
at
heidelberg
ah
how
handy
hans
is
if
he
were
here
he
could
turn
the
father
some
way
so
the
moans
would
stop
dear
dear
if
this
sickness
lasts
we
shall
never
skate
anymore
i
must
send
my
new
skates
back
to
the
beautiful
lady
hans
and
i
will
not
see
the
race
and
gretel
s
eyes
that
had
been
dry
before
grew
full
of
tears
never
cry
child
said
her
mother
soothingly
this
sickness
may
not
be
as
bad
as
we
think
the
father
has
lain
this
way
gretel
sobbed
now
oh
mother
it
is
not
that
alone
you
do
not
know
all
i
am
very
very
bad
and
wicked
you
gretel
you
so
patient
and
good
and
a
bright
puzzled
look
beamed
for
an
instant
upon
the
child
hush
lovey
you
ll
wake
gretel
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
s
lap
and
tried
not
to
cry
her
little
hand
so
thin
and
brown
lay
in
the
coarse
palm
of
her
mother
s
creased
with
many
a
hard
day
s
work
rychie
would
have
shuddered
to
touch
either
yet
they
pressed
warmly
upon
each
other
soon
gretel
looked
up
with
that
dull
homely
look
which
they
say
poor
children
in
shanties
are
apt
to
have
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
the
father
tried
to
burn
you
he
did
i
saw
him
and
he
was
laughing
hush
child
the
mother
s
words
came
so
suddenly
and
sharply
that
raff
brinker
dead
as
he
was
to
all
that
was
passing
around
him
twitched
slightly
upon
the
bed
gretel
said
no
more
but
plucked
drearily
at
the
jagged
edge
of
a
hole
in
her
mother
s
holiday
gown
it
had
been
burned
there
well
for
dame
brinker
that
the
gown
was
woolen
haarlem
the
boys
hear
voices
refreshed
and
rested
our
boys
came
forth
from
the
coffeehouse
just
as
the
big
clock
in
the
square
after
the
manner
of
certain
holland
timekeepers
was
striking
two
with
its
bell
for
two
the
captain
was
absorbed
in
thought
at
first
for
hans
brinker
s
sad
story
still
echoed
in
his
ears
not
until
ludwig
rebuked
him
with
a
laughing
wake
up
grandfather
did
he
reassume
his
position
as
gallant
of
his
band
ahem
this
way
young
gentlemen
they
were
walking
through
the
city
not
on
a
curbed
sidewalk
for
such
a
thing
is
rarely
to
be
found
in
holland
but
on
the
brick
pavement
that
lay
on
the
borders
of
the
cobblestone
without
breaking
its
level
expanse
haarlem
like
amsterdam
was
gayer
than
usual
in
honor
of
saint
nicholas
a
strange
figure
was
approaching
them
it
was
a
small
man
dressed
in
black
with
a
short
cloak
he
wore
a
wig
and
a
cocked
hat
from
which
a
long
crepe
streamer
was
flying
who
comes
here
cried
ben
what
a
that
s
the
aanspreeker
said
lambert
someone
is
is
that
the
way
men
dress
in
mourning
in
this
country
oh
no
the
aanspreeker
attends
funerals
and
it
is
his
business
when
anyone
dies
to
notify
all
the
friends
and
what
a
strange
well
said
lambert
we
needn
t
feel
very
badly
about
this
particular
death
for
i
see
another
man
has
lately
been
born
to
the
world
to
fill
up
the
vacant
ben
stared
how
do
you
know
that
don
t
you
see
that
pretty
red
pincushion
hanging
on
yonder
door
asked
lambert
in
return
well
that
s
a
a
boy
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
here
in
haarlem
whenever
a
boy
is
born
the
parents
have
a
red
pincushion
put
out
at
the
door
if
our
young
friend
had
been
a
girl
instead
of
a
boy
the
cushion
would
have
been
white
in
some
places
they
have
much
more
fanciful
affairs
all
trimmed
with
lace
and
even
among
the
very
poorest
houses
you
will
see
a
bit
of
ribbon
or
even
a
string
tied
on
the
door
latch
look
screamed
ben
there
is
a
white
cushion
at
the
door
of
that
house
with
the
funny
i
don
t
see
any
house
with
a
funny
oh
of
course
not
said
ben
i
forgot
you
re
a
native
but
all
the
roofs
are
queer
to
me
for
that
matter
i
mean
the
house
next
to
that
green
true
enough
there
s
a
girl
i
tell
you
what
captain
called
out
lambert
slipping
easily
into
dutch
we
must
get
out
of
this
street
as
soon
as
possible
it
s
full
of
babies
they
ll
set
up
a
squall
in
a
the
captain
laughed
i
shall
take
you
to
hear
better
music
than
that
he
said
we
are
just
in
time
to
hear
the
organ
of
saint
bavon
the
church
is
open
what
the
great
haarlem
organ
asked
ben
that
will
be
a
treat
indeed
i
have
often
read
of
it
with
its
tremendous
pipes
and
its
vox
humana
an
organ
stop
which
produces
an
effect
resembling
the
human
voice
that
sounds
like
a
giant
the
same
answered
lambert
van
mounen
peter
was
right
the
church
was
open
though
not
for
religious
services
someone
was
playing
upon
the
organ
as
the
boys
entered
a
swell
of
sound
rushed
forth
to
meet
them
it
seemed
to
bear
them
one
by
one
into
the
shadows
of
the
building
louder
and
louder
it
grew
until
it
became
like
the
din
and
roar
of
some
mighty
tempest
or
like
the
ocean
surging
upon
the
shore
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
a
tinkling
bell
was
heard
another
answered
then
another
and
the
storm
paused
as
if
to
listen
the
bells
grew
bolder
they
rang
out
loud
and
clear
other
bells
joined
in
they
were
tolling
in
solemn
concert
ding
dong
ding
dong
the
storm
broke
forth
with
redoubled
fury
gathering
its
distant
thunder
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
but
did
not
speak
it
was
growing
serious
what
was
that
who
screamed
what
screamed
that
terrible
musical
scream
was
it
man
or
demon
or
was
it
some
monster
shut
up
behind
that
carved
brass
frame
behind
those
great
silver
columns
some
despairing
monster
begging
screaming
for
freedom
it
was
the
vox
humana
at
last
an
answer
came
soft
tender
loving
like
a
mother
s
song
the
storm
grew
silent
hidden
birds
sprang
forth
filling
the
air
with
glad
ecstatic
music
rising
higher
and
higher
until
the
last
faint
note
was
lost
in
the
distance
the
vox
humana
was
stilled
but
in
the
glorious
hymn
of
thanksgiving
that
now
arose
one
could
almost
hear
the
throbbing
of
a
human
heart
what
did
it
mean
that
man
s
imploring
cry
should
in
time
be
met
with
a
deep
content
that
gratitude
would
give
us
freedom
to
peter
and
ben
it
seemed
that
the
angels
were
singing
their
eyes
grew
dim
and
their
souls
dizzy
with
a
strange
joy
at
last
as
if
borne
upward
by
invisible
hands
they
were
floating
away
on
the
music
all
fatigue
forgotten
and
with
no
wish
but
to
hear
forever
those
beautiful
sounds
when
suddenly
van
holp
s
sleeve
was
pulled
impatiently
and
a
gruff
voice
beside
him
asked
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
here
captain
blinking
at
the
ceiling
like
a
sick
rabbit
it
s
high
time
we
hush
whispered
peter
only
half
aroused
come
man
let
s
go
said
carl
giving
the
sleeve
a
second
pull
peter
turned
reluctantly
he
would
not
detain
the
boys
against
their
will
all
but
ben
were
casting
rather
reproachful
glances
upon
him
well
boys
he
whispered
we
will
go
softly
that
s
the
greatest
thing
i
ve
seen
or
heard
since
i
ve
bee
in
holland
cried
ben
enthusiastically
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
open
air
it
s
glorious
ludwig
and
carl
laughed
slyly
at
the
english
boy
s
wartaal
or
gibberish
jacob
yawned
and
peter
gave
ben
a
look
that
made
him
instantly
feel
that
he
and
peter
were
not
so
very
different
after
all
though
one
hailed
from
holland
and
the
other
from
england
and
lambert
the
interpreter
responded
with
a
brisk
you
may
well
say
so
i
believe
there
are
one
or
two
organs
nowadays
that
are
said
to
be
as
fine
but
for
years
and
years
this
organ
of
saint
bavon
was
the
grandest
in
the
do
you
know
how
large
it
is
asked
ben
i
noticed
that
the
church
itself
was
prodigiously
high
and
that
the
organ
filled
the
end
of
the
great
aisle
almost
from
floor
to
that
s
true
said
lambert
and
how
superb
the
pipes
looked
just
like
grand
columns
of
silver
they
re
only
for
show
you
know
the
real
pipes
are
behind
them
some
big
enough
for
a
man
to
crawl
through
and
some
smaller
than
a
baby
s
whistle
well
sir
for
size
the
church
is
higher
than
westminster
abbey
to
begin
with
and
as
you
say
the
organ
makes
a
tremendous
show
even
then
father
told
me
last
night
that
it
is
one
hundred
and
eight
feet
high
fifty
feet
wide
and
has
over
five
thousand
pipes
it
has
stops
if
you
know
what
they
are
i
don
t
and
three
good
for
you
said
ben
you
have
a
fine
memory
my
head
is
a
perfect
colander
for
figures
they
slip
through
as
fast
as
they
re
poured
in
but
other
facts
and
historical
events
stay
behind
that
s
some
there
we
differ
returned
van
mounen
i
m
great
on
names
and
figures
but
history
take
it
altogether
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
hopeless
kind
of
meantime
carl
and
ludwig
were
having
a
discussion
concerning
some
square
wooden
monuments
they
had
observed
in
the
interior
of
the
church
ludwig
declared
that
each
bore
the
name
of
the
person
buried
beneath
and
carl
insisted
that
they
had
no
names
but
only
the
heraldic
arms
of
the
deceased
painted
on
a
black
ground
with
the
date
of
the
death
in
gilt
letters
i
ought
to
know
said
carl
for
i
walked
across
to
the
east
side
to
look
for
the
cannonball
mother
told
me
was
embedded
there
it
was
fired
into
the
church
in
the
year
fifteen
hundred
and
something
by
those
rascally
spaniards
while
the
services
were
going
on
there
it
was
in
the
wall
sure
enough
and
while
i
was
walking
back
i
noticed
the
monuments
i
tell
you
they
haven
t
the
sign
of
a
name
on
ask
peter
said
ludwig
only
half
convinced
carl
is
right
replied
peter
who
though
conversing
with
jacob
had
overheard
their
dispute
well
jacob
as
i
was
saying
handel
the
great
composer
chanced
to
visit
haarlem
and
of
course
he
at
once
hunted
up
this
famous
organ
he
gained
admittance
and
was
playing
upon
it
with
all
his
might
when
the
regular
organist
chanced
to
enter
the
building
the
man
stood
awestruck
he
was
a
good
player
himself
but
he
had
never
heard
such
music
before
who
is
there
he
cried
if
it
is
not
an
angel
or
the
devil
it
must
be
handel
when
he
discovered
that
it
was
the
great
musician
he
was
still
more
mystified
but
how
is
this
he
said
you
have
done
impossible
things
no
ten
fingers
on
earth
can
play
the
passages
you
have
given
human
fingers
couldn
t
control
all
the
keys
and
stops
i
know
it
said
handel
coolly
and
for
that
reason
i
was
forced
to
strike
some
notes
with
the
end
of
my
donder
just
think
how
the
old
organist
must
have
stared
hey
what
exclaimed
jacob
startled
when
peter
s
animated
voice
suddenly
became
silent
haven
t
you
heard
me
you
rascal
was
the
indignant
rejoinder
oh
yes
no
the
fact
is
i
heard
you
at
first
i
m
awake
now
but
i
do
believe
i
ve
been
walking
beside
you
half
asleep
stammered
jacob
with
such
a
doleful
bewildered
look
on
his
face
that
peter
could
not
help
laughing
the
man
with
four
heads
after
leaving
the
church
the
boys
stopped
nearby
in
the
open
marketplace
to
look
at
the
bronze
statue
of
laurens
janszoon
coster
who
is
believed
by
the
dutch
to
have
been
the
inventor
of
printing
this
is
disputed
by
those
who
award
the
same
honor
to
johannes
gutenberg
of
mayence
while
many
maintain
that
faustus
a
servant
of
coster
stole
his
master
s
wooden
types
on
a
christmas
eve
when
the
latter
was
at
church
and
fled
with
his
booty
and
his
secret
to
mayence
coster
was
a
native
of
haarlem
and
the
hollanders
are
naturally
anxious
to
secure
the
credit
of
the
invention
for
their
illustrious
townsman
certain
it
is
that
the
first
book
he
printed
is
kept
by
the
city
in
a
silver
case
wrapped
in
silk
and
is
shown
with
great
caution
as
a
precious
relic
it
is
said
that
he
first
conceived
the
idea
of
printing
from
cutting
his
name
upon
the
bark
of
a
tree
and
afterward
pressing
a
piece
of
paper
upon
the
characters
of
course
lambert
and
his
english
friend
fully
discussed
this
subject
they
also
had
a
rather
warm
argument
concerning
another
invention
lambert
declared
that
the
honor
of
giving
both
the
telescope
and
the
microscope
to
the
world
lay
between
metius
and
jansen
both
hollanders
while
ben
as
stoutly
insisted
that
roger
bacon
an
english
monk
of
the
thirteenth
century
wrote
out
the
whole
thing
sir
perfect
descriptions
of
microscopes
and
telescopes
too
long
before
either
of
those
other
fellows
was
on
one
subject
however
they
both
agreed
that
the
art
of
curing
and
pickling
herrings
was
discovered
by
william
beukles
of
holland
and
that
the
country
did
perfectly
right
in
honoring
him
as
a
national
benefactor
for
its
wealth
and
importance
had
been
in
a
great
measure
due
to
its
herring
trade
it
is
astonishing
said
ben
in
what
prodigious
quantities
those
fish
are
found
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
here
but
on
the
coast
of
england
off
yarmouth
the
herring
shoals
have
been
known
to
be
six
and
seven
feet
deep
with
that
is
prodigious
indeed
said
lambert
but
you
know
your
herring
is
derived
from
the
german
heer
an
army
on
account
of
a
way
the
fish
have
of
coming
in
large
soon
afterward
while
passing
a
cobbler
s
shop
ben
exclaimed
halloo
lambert
here
is
the
name
of
one
of
your
greatest
men
over
a
cobbler
s
stall
boerhaave
if
it
were
only
herman
boerhaave
instead
of
hendrick
it
would
be
lambert
knit
his
brows
reflectively
as
he
replied
boerhaave
boerhaave
the
name
is
perfectly
familiar
i
remember
too
that
he
was
born
in
but
the
rest
is
all
gone
as
usual
there
have
been
so
many
famous
hollanders
you
see
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
fellow
to
know
them
all
what
was
he
did
he
have
two
heads
or
was
he
one
of
your
great
natural
swimmers
like
marco
polo
he
had
four
heads
answered
ben
laughing
for
he
was
a
great
physician
naturalist
botanist
and
chemist
i
am
full
of
him
just
now
for
i
read
his
life
a
few
weeks
pour
out
a
little
then
said
lambert
only
walk
faster
or
we
shall
lose
sight
of
the
other
well
resumed
ben
quickening
his
pace
and
looking
with
great
interest
at
everything
going
on
in
the
crowded
street
this
boerhaave
was
a
great
a
great
what
roared
lambert
oh
i
beg
pardon
i
was
thinking
of
that
man
over
there
with
the
cocked
hat
he
s
an
anspewker
isn
t
he
yes
he
s
an
aanspreeker
if
that
is
what
you
mean
to
say
but
what
about
your
friend
with
the
four
heads
well
as
i
was
going
to
say
the
doctor
was
left
a
penniless
orphan
at
sixteen
without
education
or
friends
jolly
beginning
interposed
lambert
now
don
t
interrupt
he
was
a
poor
friendless
orphan
at
sixteen
but
he
was
so
persevering
and
industrious
so
determined
to
gain
knowledge
that
he
made
his
way
and
in
time
became
one
of
the
most
learned
men
of
europe
all
the
what
is
that
where
what
do
you
mean
why
that
paper
on
the
door
opposite
don
t
you
see
two
or
three
persons
are
reading
it
i
have
noticed
several
of
these
papers
since
i
ve
been
oh
that
s
only
a
health
bulletin
somebody
in
the
house
is
ill
and
to
prevent
a
steady
knocking
at
the
door
the
family
write
an
account
of
the
patient
s
condition
on
a
placard
and
hang
it
outside
the
door
for
the
benefit
of
inquiring
friends
a
very
sensible
custom
i
m
sure
nothing
strange
about
it
that
i
can
see
go
on
please
you
said
all
the
and
there
you
left
me
i
was
going
to
say
resumed
ben
that
all
the
all
the
how
comically
persons
do
dress
here
to
be
sure
just
look
at
those
men
and
women
with
their
sugarloaf
hats
and
see
this
woman
ahead
of
us
with
a
straw
bonnet
like
a
scoop
shovel
tapering
to
a
point
in
the
back
did
ever
you
see
anything
so
funny
and
those
tremendous
wooden
shoes
too
i
declare
she
s
a
beauty
oh
they
are
only
folk
said
lambert
rather
impatiently
you
might
as
well
let
old
boerhaave
drop
or
else
shut
your
ha
ha
well
i
was
going
to
say
all
the
big
men
of
his
day
sought
out
this
great
professor
even
peter
the
great
when
he
came
over
to
holland
from
russia
to
learn
shipbuilding
attended
his
lectures
regularly
by
that
time
boerhaave
was
professor
of
medicine
and
chemistry
and
botany
in
the
university
at
leyden
he
had
grown
to
be
very
wealthy
as
a
practicing
physician
but
he
used
to
say
that
the
poor
were
his
best
patients
because
god
would
be
their
paymaster
all
europe
learned
to
love
and
honor
him
in
short
he
became
so
famous
that
a
certain
mandarin
of
china
addressed
a
letter
to
the
illustrious
boerhaave
physician
in
europe
and
the
letter
found
its
way
to
him
without
any
my
goodness
that
is
what
i
call
being
a
public
character
the
boys
have
stopped
how
now
captain
van
holp
where
next
we
propose
to
move
on
said
van
holp
there
is
nothing
to
see
at
this
season
in
the
bosch
the
bosch
is
a
noble
wood
benjamin
a
grand
park
where
they
have
most
magnificent
trees
protected
by
law
do
you
understand
ya
nodded
ben
as
the
captain
proceeded
unless
you
all
desire
to
visit
the
museum
of
natural
history
we
may
go
on
the
grand
canal
again
if
we
had
more
time
it
would
be
pleasant
to
take
benjamin
up
the
blue
what
are
the
blue
stairs
lambert
asked
ben
they
are
the
highest
point
of
the
dunes
you
have
a
grand
view
of
the
ocean
from
there
besides
a
fine
chance
to
see
how
wonderful
these
dunes
are
one
can
hardly
believe
that
the
wind
could
ever
heap
up
sand
in
so
remarkable
a
way
but
we
have
to
go
through
bloemendal
to
get
there
not
a
very
pretty
village
and
some
distance
from
here
what
do
you
say
oh
i
am
ready
for
anything
for
my
part
i
would
rather
steer
direct
for
leyden
but
we
ll
do
as
the
captain
says
hey
jacob
ya
dat
ish
goot
said
jacob
who
felt
decidedly
more
like
taking
a
nap
than
ascending
the
blue
stairs
the
captain
was
in
favor
of
going
to
leyden
it
s
four
long
miles
from
here
full
sixteen
of
your
english
miles
benjamin
we
have
no
time
to
lose
if
you
wish
to
reach
there
before
midnight
decide
quickly
boys
blue
stairs
or
leyden
leyden
they
answered
and
were
out
of
haarlem
in
a
twinkling
admiring
the
lofty
towerlike
windmills
and
pretty
country
seats
as
they
left
the
city
behind
them
if
you
really
wish
to
see
haarlem
said
lambert
to
ben
after
they
had
skated
awhile
in
silence
you
should
visit
it
in
summer
it
is
the
greatest
place
in
the
world
for
beautiful
flowers
the
walks
around
the
city
are
superb
and
the
wood
with
its
miles
of
noble
elms
all
in
full
feather
is
something
to
remember
you
need
not
smile
old
fellow
at
my
saying
full
i
was
thinking
of
waving
plumes
and
got
my
words
mixed
up
a
little
but
a
dutch
elm
beats
everything
it
is
the
noblest
tree
on
earth
ben
if
you
except
the
english
aye
said
ben
solemnly
if
you
except
the
english
and
for
some
moments
he
could
scarcely
see
the
canal
because
robby
and
jenny
kept
bobbing
in
the
air
before
his
eyes
friends
in
need
in
the
meantime
the
other
boys
were
listening
to
peter
s
account
of
an
incident
which
had
occurred
long
ago
sir
thomas
carr
s
tour
through
holland
in
a
part
of
the
city
where
stood
an
ancient
castle
whose
lord
had
tyrannized
over
the
burghers
of
the
town
to
such
an
extent
that
they
surrounded
his
castle
and
laid
siege
to
it
just
at
the
last
extremity
when
the
haughty
lord
felt
that
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
was
prepared
to
sell
his
life
as
dearly
as
possible
his
lady
appeared
on
the
ramparts
and
offered
to
surrender
everything
provided
she
was
permitted
to
bring
out
and
retain
as
much
of
her
most
precious
household
goods
as
she
could
carry
upon
her
back
the
promise
was
given
and
the
lady
came
forth
from
the
gateway
bearing
her
husband
upon
her
shoulders
the
burghers
pledge
preserved
him
from
the
fury
of
the
troops
but
left
them
free
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
the
castle
do
you
believe
that
story
captain
peter
asked
carl
in
an
incredulous
tone
of
course
i
do
it
is
historical
why
should
i
doubt
it
simply
because
no
woman
could
do
it
and
if
she
could
she
wouldn
t
that
is
my
and
i
believe
that
there
are
many
who
would
that
is
to
save
those
they
really
cared
for
said
ludwig
jacob
who
in
spite
of
his
fat
and
sleepiness
was
of
rather
a
sentimental
turn
had
listened
with
deep
interest
that
is
right
little
fellow
he
said
nodding
his
head
approvingly
i
believe
every
word
of
it
i
shall
never
marry
a
woman
who
would
not
be
glad
to
do
as
much
for
heaven
help
her
cried
carl
turning
to
gaze
at
the
speaker
why
poot
three
men
couldn
t
do
it
perhaps
not
said
jacob
quietly
feeling
that
he
had
asked
rather
too
much
of
the
future
poot
but
she
must
be
willing
that
is
aye
responded
peter
s
cheery
voice
willing
heart
makes
nimble
foot
and
who
knows
but
it
may
make
strong
arms
pete
asked
ludwig
changing
the
subject
did
you
tell
me
last
night
that
the
painter
wouwerman
was
born
in
haarlem
yes
and
jacob
ruysdael
and
berghem
too
i
like
berghem
because
he
was
always
they
say
he
always
sang
while
he
painted
and
though
he
died
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
there
are
traditions
still
afloat
concerning
his
pleasant
laugh
he
was
a
great
painter
and
he
had
a
wife
as
cross
as
they
balanced
each
other
finely
said
ludwig
he
was
kind
and
she
was
cross
but
peter
before
i
forget
it
wasn
t
that
picture
of
saint
hubert
and
the
horse
painted
by
wouwerman
you
remember
father
showed
us
an
engraving
from
it
last
yes
indeed
there
is
a
story
connected
with
that
tell
us
cried
two
or
three
drawing
closer
to
peter
as
they
skated
on
wouwerman
began
the
captain
oratorically
was
born
in
just
four
years
before
berghem
he
was
a
master
of
his
art
and
especially
excelled
in
painting
horses
strange
as
it
may
seem
people
were
so
long
finding
out
his
merits
that
even
after
he
had
arrived
at
the
height
of
his
excellence
he
was
obliged
to
sell
his
pictures
for
very
paltry
prices
the
poor
artist
became
completely
discouraged
and
worst
of
all
was
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
one
day
he
was
talking
over
his
troubles
with
his
who
was
one
of
the
few
who
recognized
his
genius
the
priest
determined
to
assist
him
and
accordingly
lent
him
six
hundred
guilders
advising
him
at
the
same
time
to
demand
a
better
price
for
his
pictures
wouwerman
did
so
and
in
the
meantime
paid
his
debts
matters
brightened
with
him
at
once
everybody
appreciated
the
great
artist
who
painted
such
costly
pictures
he
grew
rich
the
six
hundred
guilders
were
returned
and
in
gratitude
wouwerman
sent
also
a
work
which
he
had
painted
representing
his
benefactor
as
saint
hubert
kneeling
before
his
horse
the
very
picture
ludwig
of
which
we
were
speaking
last
so
so
exclaimed
ludwig
with
deep
interest
i
must
take
another
look
at
the
engraving
as
soon
as
we
get
at
that
same
hour
while
ben
was
skating
with
his
companions
beside
the
holland
dike
robby
and
jenny
stood
in
their
pretty
english
schoolhouse
ready
to
join
in
the
duties
of
their
reading
class
commence
master
robert
dobbs
said
the
teacher
page
now
sir
mind
every
and
robby
in
a
quick
childish
voice
roared
forth
at
schoolroom
pitch
lesson
the
hero
of
haarlem
many
years
ago
there
lived
in
haarlem
one
of
the
principal
cities
of
holland
a
boy
of
gentle
disposition
his
father
was
a
sluicer
that
is
a
man
whose
business
it
was
to
open
and
close
the
sluices
or
large
oaken
gates
that
are
placed
at
regular
distances
across
the
entrances
of
the
canals
to
regulate
the
amount
of
water
that
shall
flow
into
them
the
sluicer
raises
the
gates
more
or
less
according
to
the
quantity
of
water
required
and
closes
them
carefully
at
night
in
order
to
avoid
all
possible
danger
of
an
oversupply
running
into
the
canal
or
the
water
would
soon
overflow
it
and
inundate
the
surrounding
country
as
a
great
portion
of
holland
is
lower
than
the
level
of
the
sea
the
waters
are
kept
from
flooding
the
land
only
by
means
of
strong
dikes
or
barriers
and
by
means
of
these
sluices
which
are
often
strained
to
the
utmost
by
the
pressure
of
the
rising
tides
even
the
little
children
in
holland
know
that
constant
watchfulness
is
required
to
keep
the
rivers
and
ocean
from
overwhelming
the
country
and
that
a
moment
s
neglect
of
the
sluicer
s
duty
may
bring
ruin
and
death
to
very
good
said
the
teacher
now
one
lovely
autumn
afternoon
when
the
boy
was
about
eight
years
old
he
obtained
his
parents
consent
to
carry
some
cakes
to
a
blind
man
who
lived
out
in
the
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
dike
the
little
fellow
started
on
his
errand
with
a
light
heart
and
having
spent
an
hour
with
his
grateful
old
friend
he
bade
him
farewell
and
started
on
his
homeward
walk
trudging
stoutly
along
the
canal
he
noticed
how
the
autumn
rains
had
swollen
the
waters
even
while
humming
his
careless
childish
song
he
thought
of
his
father
s
brave
old
gates
and
felt
glad
of
their
strength
for
thought
he
if
they
gave
way
where
would
father
and
mother
be
these
pretty
fields
would
all
be
covered
with
the
angry
waters
father
always
calls
them
the
angry
waters
i
suppose
he
thinks
they
are
mad
at
him
for
keeping
them
out
so
and
with
these
thoughts
just
flitting
across
his
brain
the
little
fellow
stooped
to
pick
the
pretty
flowers
that
grew
along
his
way
sometimes
he
stopped
to
throw
some
feathery
seed
ball
in
the
air
and
watch
it
as
it
floated
away
sometimes
he
listened
to
the
stealthy
rustling
of
a
rabbit
speeding
through
the
grass
but
oftener
he
smiled
as
he
recalled
the
happy
light
he
had
seen
arise
on
the
weary
listening
face
of
his
blind
old
now
henry
said
the
teacher
nodding
to
the
next
little
reader
suddenly
the
boy
looked
around
him
in
dismay
he
had
not
noticed
that
the
sun
was
setting
now
he
saw
that
his
long
shadow
on
the
grass
had
vanished
it
was
growing
dark
he
was
still
some
distance
from
home
and
in
a
lonely
ravine
where
even
the
blue
flowers
had
turned
to
gray
he
quickened
his
footsteps
and
with
a
beating
heart
recalled
many
a
nursery
tale
of
children
belated
in
dreary
forests
just
as
he
was
bracing
himself
for
a
run
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
trickling
water
whence
did
it
come
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
small
hole
in
the
dike
through
which
a
tiny
stream
was
flowing
any
child
in
holland
will
shudder
at
the
thought
of
a
leak
in
the
dike
the
boy
understood
the
danger
at
a
glance
that
little
hole
if
the
water
were
allowed
to
trickle
through
would
soon
be
a
large
one
and
a
terrible
inundation
would
be
the
result
quick
as
a
flash
he
saw
his
duty
throwing
away
his
flowers
the
boy
clambered
up
the
heights
until
he
reached
the
hole
his
chubby
little
finger
was
thrust
in
almost
before
he
knew
it
the
flowing
was
stopped
ah
he
thought
with
a
chuckle
of
boyish
delight
the
angry
waters
must
stay
back
now
haarlem
shall
not
be
drowned
while
i
am
here
this
was
all
very
well
at
first
but
the
night
was
falling
rapidly
chill
vapors
filled
the
air
our
little
hero
began
to
tremble
with
cold
and
dread
he
shouted
loudly
he
screamed
come
here
come
here
but
no
one
came
the
cold
grew
more
intense
a
numbness
commencing
in
the
tired
little
finger
crept
over
his
hand
and
arm
and
soon
his
whole
body
was
filled
with
pain
he
shouted
again
will
no
one
come
mother
mother
alas
his
mother
good
practical
soul
had
already
locked
the
doors
and
had
fully
resolved
to
scold
him
on
the
morrow
for
spending
the
night
with
blind
jansen
without
her
permission
he
tried
to
whistle
perhaps
some
straggling
boy
might
heed
the
signal
but
his
teeth
chattered
so
it
was
impossible
then
he
called
on
god
for
help
and
the
answer
came
through
a
holy
resolution
i
will
stay
here
till
now
jenny
dobbs
said
the
teacher
jenny
s
eyes
were
glistening
but
she
took
a
long
breath
and
commenced
the
midnight
moon
looked
down
upon
that
small
solitary
form
sitting
upon
a
stone
halfway
up
the
dike
his
head
was
bent
but
he
was
not
asleep
for
every
now
and
then
one
restless
hand
rubbed
feebly
the
outstretched
arm
that
seemed
fastened
to
the
dike
and
often
the
pale
tearful
face
turned
quickly
at
some
real
or
fancied
sounds
how
can
we
know
the
sufferings
of
that
long
and
fearful
watch
what
falterings
of
purpose
what
childish
terrors
came
over
the
boy
as
he
thought
of
the
warm
little
bed
at
home
of
his
parents
his
brothers
and
sisters
then
looked
into
the
cold
dreary
night
if
he
drew
away
that
tiny
finger
the
angry
waters
grown
angrier
still
would
rush
forth
and
never
stop
until
they
had
swept
over
the
town
no
he
would
hold
it
there
till
daylight
if
he
lived
he
was
not
very
sure
of
living
what
did
this
strange
buzzing
mean
and
then
the
knives
that
seemed
pricking
and
piercing
him
from
head
to
foot
he
was
not
certain
now
that
he
could
draw
his
finger
away
even
if
he
wished
to
at
daybreak
a
clergyman
returning
from
the
bedside
of
a
sick
parishioner
thought
he
heard
groans
as
he
walked
along
on
the
top
of
the
dike
bending
he
saw
far
down
on
the
side
a
child
apparently
writhing
with
pain
in
the
name
of
wonder
boy
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
there
i
am
keeping
the
water
from
running
out
was
the
simple
answer
of
the
little
hero
tell
them
to
come
it
is
needless
to
add
that
they
did
come
quickly
and
that
jenny
dobbs
said
the
teacher
rather
impatiently
if
you
can
not
control
your
feelings
so
as
to
read
distinctly
we
will
wait
until
you
recover
yes
sir
said
jenny
quite
startled
it
was
strange
but
at
that
very
moment
ben
far
over
the
sea
was
saying
to
lambert
the
noble
little
fellow
i
have
frequently
met
with
an
account
of
the
incident
but
i
never
knew
till
now
that
it
was
really
true
of
course
it
is
said
lambert
i
have
given
you
the
story
just
as
mother
told
it
to
me
years
ago
why
there
is
not
a
child
in
holland
who
does
not
know
it
and
ben
you
may
not
think
so
but
that
little
boy
represents
the
spirit
of
the
whole
country
not
a
leak
can
show
itself
anywhere
either
in
its
politics
honor
or
public
safety
that
a
million
fingers
are
not
ready
to
stop
it
at
any
whew
cried
master
ben
big
talking
that
it
s
true
talk
anyway
rejoined
lambert
so
very
quietly
that
ben
wisely
resolved
to
make
no
further
comment
on
the
canal
the
skating
season
had
commenced
unusually
early
our
boys
were
by
no
means
alone
upon
the
ice
the
afternoon
was
so
fine
that
men
women
and
children
bent
upon
enjoying
the
holiday
had
flocked
to
the
grand
canal
from
far
and
near
saint
nicholas
had
evidently
remembered
the
favorite
pastime
shining
new
skates
were
everywhere
to
be
seen
whole
families
were
skimming
their
way
to
haarlem
or
leyden
or
the
neighboring
villages
the
ice
seemed
fairly
alive
men
noticed
the
erect
easy
carriage
of
women
and
their
picturesque
variety
of
costume
there
were
the
latest
fashions
fresh
from
paris
floating
past
dingy
garments
that
had
seen
service
through
two
generations
bonnets
perched
over
freckled
faces
bright
with
holiday
smiles
stiff
muslin
caps
with
wings
at
the
sides
flapping
beside
cheeks
rosy
with
health
and
contentment
furs
too
encircling
the
whitest
of
throats
and
scanty
garments
fluttering
below
faces
ruddy
with
exercise
in
short
every
quaint
and
comical
mixture
of
dry
goods
and
flesh
that
holland
could
furnish
seemed
sent
to
enliven
the
scene
there
were
belles
from
leyden
and
fishwives
from
the
border
villages
cheese
women
from
gouda
and
prim
matrons
from
beautiful
country
seats
on
the
haarlemmer
meer
skaters
were
constantly
to
be
seen
wrinkled
old
women
with
baskets
upon
their
heads
and
plump
little
toddlers
on
skates
clutching
at
their
mothers
gowns
some
women
carried
their
babies
upon
their
backs
firmly
secured
with
a
bright
shawl
the
effect
was
pretty
and
graceful
as
they
darted
by
or
sailed
slowly
past
now
nodding
to
an
acquaintance
now
chirruping
and
throwing
soft
baby
talk
to
the
muffled
little
ones
they
carried
boys
and
girls
were
chasing
each
other
and
hiding
behind
the
sleds
that
loaded
high
with
peat
or
timber
pursued
their
cautious
way
along
the
track
marked
out
as
beautiful
queenly
women
were
there
enjoyment
sparkling
in
their
quiet
eyes
sometimes
a
long
file
of
young
men
each
grasping
the
coat
of
the
one
before
him
flew
by
with
electric
speed
and
sometimes
the
ice
squeaked
under
the
chair
of
some
gorgeous
old
dowager
or
rich
burgomaster
s
lady
who
very
red
in
the
nose
and
sharp
in
the
eyes
looked
like
a
invented
by
old
father
winter
for
the
protection
of
his
skating
grounds
the
chair
would
be
heavy
with
foot
stoves
and
cushions
to
say
nothing
of
the
old
lady
mounted
upon
shining
runners
it
slid
along
pushed
by
the
sleepiest
of
servants
who
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
bent
himself
to
his
task
while
she
cast
direful
glances
upon
the
screaming
little
rowdies
who
invariably
acted
as
bodyguard
as
for
the
men
they
were
pictures
of
placid
enjoyment
some
were
attired
in
ordinary
citizen
s
dress
but
many
looked
odd
enough
with
their
short
woolen
coats
wide
breeches
and
big
silver
buckles
these
seemed
to
ben
like
little
boys
who
had
by
a
miracle
sprung
suddenly
into
manhood
and
were
forced
to
wear
garments
that
their
astonished
mothers
had
altered
in
a
hurry
he
noticed
too
that
nearly
all
the
men
had
pipes
as
they
passed
him
whizzing
and
smoking
like
so
many
locomotives
there
was
every
variety
of
pipes
from
those
of
common
clay
to
the
most
expensive
meerschaums
mounted
in
silver
and
gold
some
were
carved
into
extraordinary
and
fantastic
shapes
representing
birds
flowers
heads
bugs
and
dozens
of
other
things
some
resembled
the
dutchman
s
pipe
that
grows
in
our
american
woods
some
were
red
and
many
were
of
a
pure
snowy
white
but
the
most
respectable
were
those
which
were
ripening
into
a
shaded
brown
the
deeper
and
richer
the
brown
of
course
the
more
honored
the
pipe
for
it
was
proof
that
the
owner
if
honestly
shading
it
was
deliberately
devoting
his
manhood
to
the
effort
what
pipe
would
not
be
proud
to
be
the
object
of
such
a
sacrifice
for
a
while
ben
skated
on
in
silence
there
was
so
much
to
engage
his
attention
that
he
almost
forgot
his
companions
part
of
the
time
he
had
been
watching
the
iceboats
as
they
flew
over
the
great
haarlemmer
meer
or
lake
the
frozen
surface
of
which
was
now
plainly
visible
from
the
canal
these
boats
had
very
large
sails
much
larger
in
proportion
than
those
of
ordinary
vessels
and
were
set
upon
a
triangular
frame
furnished
with
an
iron
runner
at
each
corner
the
widest
part
of
the
triangle
crossing
the
bow
and
its
point
stretching
beyond
the
stem
they
had
rudders
for
guiding
and
brakes
for
arresting
their
progress
and
were
of
all
sizes
and
kinds
from
small
rough
affairs
managed
by
a
boy
to
large
and
beautiful
ones
filled
with
gay
pleasure
parties
and
manned
by
competent
sailors
who
smoking
their
stumpy
pipes
reefed
and
tacked
and
steered
with
great
solemnity
and
precision
some
of
the
boats
were
painted
and
gilded
in
gaudy
style
and
flaunted
gay
pennons
from
their
mastheads
others
white
as
snow
with
every
spotless
sail
rounded
by
the
wind
looked
like
swans
borne
onward
by
a
resistless
current
it
seemed
to
ben
as
following
his
fancy
he
watched
one
of
these
in
the
distance
that
he
could
almost
hear
its
helpless
terrified
cry
but
he
soon
found
that
the
sound
arose
from
a
nearer
and
less
romantic
cause
from
an
iceboat
not
fifty
yards
from
him
using
its
brakes
to
avoid
a
collision
with
a
peat
sled
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
these
boats
to
be
upon
the
canal
and
their
appearance
generally
caused
no
little
excitement
among
skaters
especially
among
the
timid
but
today
every
iceboat
in
the
country
seemed
afloat
or
rather
aslide
and
the
canal
had
its
full
share
ben
though
delighted
at
the
sight
was
often
startled
at
the
swift
approach
of
the
resistless
things
threatening
to
dart
in
any
and
every
possible
direction
it
required
all
his
energies
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
passersby
and
to
prevent
those
screaming
little
urchins
from
upsetting
him
with
their
sleds
once
he
halted
to
watch
some
boys
who
were
making
a
hole
in
the
ice
preparatory
to
using
their
fishing
spears
just
as
he
concluded
to
start
again
he
found
himself
suddenly
bumped
into
an
old
lady
s
lap
her
had
come
upon
him
from
the
rear
the
old
lady
screamed
the
servant
who
was
propelling
her
gave
a
warning
hiss
in
another
instant
ben
found
himself
apologizing
to
empty
air
the
indignant
old
lady
was
far
ahead
this
was
a
slight
mishap
compared
with
one
that
now
threatened
him
a
huge
iceboat
under
full
sail
came
tearing
down
the
canal
almost
paralyzing
ben
with
the
thought
of
instant
destruction
it
was
close
upon
him
he
saw
its
gilded
prow
heard
the
schipper
skipper
master
of
a
small
trading
vessel
a
pleasure
boat
or
iceboat
shout
felt
the
great
boom
fairly
whiz
over
his
head
was
blind
deaf
and
dumb
all
in
an
instant
then
opened
his
eyes
to
find
himself
spinning
some
yards
behind
its
great
skatelike
rudder
it
had
passed
within
an
inch
of
his
shoulder
but
he
was
safe
safe
to
see
england
again
safe
to
kiss
the
dear
faces
that
for
an
instant
had
flashed
before
him
one
by
one
father
mother
robby
and
jenny
that
great
boom
had
dashed
their
images
into
his
very
soul
he
knew
now
how
much
he
loved
them
perhaps
this
knowledge
made
him
face
complacently
the
scowls
of
those
on
the
canal
who
seemed
to
feel
that
a
boy
in
danger
was
necessarily
a
bad
boy
needing
instant
reprimand
lambert
chided
him
roundly
i
thought
it
was
all
over
with
you
you
careless
fellow
why
don
t
you
look
where
you
are
going
not
content
with
sitting
on
all
the
old
ladies
laps
you
must
make
a
juggernaut
of
every
iceboat
that
comes
along
we
shall
have
to
hand
you
over
to
the
aanspreekers
yet
if
you
don
t
look
out
please
don
t
said
ben
with
mock
humility
then
seeing
how
pale
lambert
s
lips
were
he
added
in
a
low
tone
i
do
believe
i
thought
more
in
that
one
moment
van
mounen
than
in
all
the
rest
of
my
past
there
was
no
reply
and
for
a
while
the
two
boys
skated
on
in
silence
soon
a
faint
sound
of
distant
bells
reached
their
ears
hark
said
ben
what
is
that
the
carillons
replied
lambert
they
are
trying
the
bells
in
the
chapel
of
yonder
village
ah
ben
you
should
hear
the
chimes
of
the
new
church
at
delft
they
are
superb
nearly
five
hundred
bells
and
on
of
the
best
carillonneurs
of
holland
to
play
upon
them
hard
work
though
they
say
the
fellow
often
has
to
go
to
bed
from
positive
exhaustion
after
his
performances
you
see
the
bells
are
attached
to
a
kind
of
keyboard
something
like
they
have
on
pianofortes
there
is
also
a
set
of
pedals
for
the
feet
when
a
brisk
tune
is
going
on
the
player
looks
like
a
kicking
frog
fastened
to
his
seat
with
a
for
shame
said
ben
indignantly
peter
had
for
the
present
exhausted
his
stock
of
haarlem
anecdotes
and
now
having
nothing
to
do
but
skate
he
and
his
three
companions
were
hastening
to
catch
up
with
lambert
and
ben
that
english
lad
is
fleet
enough
said
peter
if
he
were
a
born
hollander
he
could
do
no
better
generally
these
john
bulls
make
but
a
sorry
figure
on
skates
halloo
here
you
are
van
mounen
why
we
hardly
hoped
for
the
honor
of
meeting
you
again
whom
were
you
flying
from
in

retorted
lambert
what
kept

we
have
been
talking
and
besides
we
halted
once
to
give
poot
a
chance
to
he
begins
to
look
rather
said
lambert
in
a
low
voice
just
then
a
beautiful
iceboat
with
reefed
sail
and
flying
streamers
swept
leisurely
by
its
deck
was
filled
with
children
muffled
up
to
their
chins
looking
at
them
from
the
ice
you
could
see
only
smiling
little
faces
imbedded
in
woolen
wrappings
they
were
singing
a
chorus
in
honor
of
saint
nicholas
the
music
starting
in
the
discord
of
a
hundred
childish
voices
floated
as
it
rose
into
exquisite
harmony
friend
of
sailors
and
of
children

jacob
poot
changes
the
plan
the
last
note
died
away
in
the
distance
our
boys
who
in
their
vain
efforts
to
keep
up
with
the
boat
had
felt
that
they
were
skating
backward
turned
to
look
at
one
another
how
beautiful
that
was
exclaimed
van
mounen
just
like
a
dream
jacob
drew
close
to
ben
giving
his
usual
approving
nod
as
he
spoke
dat
ish
goot
dat
ish
te
pest
vay
i
shay
petter
to
take
to
leyden
mit
a
poat
take
a
boat
exclaimed
ben
in
dismay
why
man
our
plan
was
to
skate
not
to
be
carried
like
little
tuyfels
retorted
jacob
dat
ish
no
little
no
papies
to
go
for
poat
the
boys
laughed
but
exchanged
uneasy
glances
it
would
be
great
fun
to
jump
on
an
iceboat
if
they
had
a
chance
but
to
abandon
so
shamefully
their
grand
undertaking
who
could
think
of
such
a
thing
an
animated
discussion
arose
at
once
captain
peter
brought
his
party
to
a
halt
boys
said
he
it
strikes
me
that
we
should
consult
jacob
s
wishes
in
this
matter
he
started
the
excursion
you
pooh
sneered
carl
throwing
a
contemptuous
glance
at
jacob
who
s
tired
we
can
rest
all
night
in
ludwig
and
lambert
looked
anxious
and
disappointed
it
was
no
slight
thing
to
lose
the
credit
of
having
skated
all
the
way
from
broek
to
the
hague
and
back
again
but
both
agreed
that
jacob
should
decide
the
question
tired
jacob
he
read
the
popular
sentiment
at
a
glance
oh
no
he
said
in
dutch
i
was
joking
we
will
skate
of
the
boys
gave
a
delighted
shout
and
started
on
again
with
renewed
vigor
all
but
jacob
he
tried
his
best
not
to
seem
fatigued
and
by
not
saying
a
word
saved
his
breath
and
energy
for
the
great
business
of
skating
but
in
vain
before
long
the
stout
body
grew
heavier
and
heavier
the
tottering
limbs
weaker
and
weaker
worse
than
all
the
blood
anxious
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
ice
mounted
to
the
puffy
cheeks
and
made
the
roots
of
his
thin
yellow
hair
glow
into
a
fiery
red
this
kind
of
work
is
apt
to
summon
vertigo
of
whom
good
hans
anderson
writes
the
same
who
hurls
daring
young
hunters
from
the
mountains
or
spins
them
from
the
sharpest
heights
of
the
glaciers
or
catches
them
as
they
tread
the
of
the
mountain
torrent
vertigo
came
unseen
to
jacob
after
tormenting
him
awhile
with
one
touch
sending
a
chill
from
head
to
foot
with
the
next
scorching
every
vein
with
fever
she
made
the
canal
rock
and
tremble
beneath
him
the
white
sails
bow
and
spin
as
they
passed
then
cast
him
heavily
upon
the
ice
halloo
cried
van
mounen
there
goes
poot
ben
sprang
hastily
forward
jacob
jacob
are
you
hurt
peter
and
carl
were
lifting
him
the
face
was
white
enough
now
it
seemed
like
a
dead
face
even
the
look
was
gone
a
crowd
collected
peter
unbuttoned
the
poor
boy
s
jacket
loosened
his
red
tippet
and
blew
between
the
parted
lips
stand
off
good
people
he
cried
give
him
air
lay
him
down
called
out
a
woman
from
the
crowd
stand
him
upon
his
feet
shouted
another
give
him
wine
growled
a
stout
fellow
who
was
driving
a
loaded
sled
yes
yes
give
him
wine
echoed
everybody
ludwig
and
lambert
shouted
in
concert
wine
wine
who
has
wine
a
dutchman
began
to
fumble
mysteriously
under
the
heaviest
of
blue
jackets
saying
as
he
did
so
not
so
much
noise
young
masters
not
so
much
noise
the
boy
was
a
fool
to
faint
like
a
wine
quick
cried
peter
who
with
ben
s
help
was
rubbing
jacob
from
head
to
foot
ludwig
stretched
forth
his
hand
imploringly
toward
the
dutchman
who
with
an
air
of
great
importance
was
still
fumbling
beneath
the
jacket
do
hurry
he
will
die
has
anyone
else
any
wine
he
is
dead
said
an
awful
voice
from
among
the
bystanders
this
startled
the
dutchman
have
a
care
he
said
reluctantly
drawing
forth
a
small
blue
flask
this
is
schnapps
a
little
is
a
little
was
enough
the
paleness
gave
way
to
a
faint
flush
jacob
opened
his
eyes
and
half
bewildered
half
ashamed
feebly
tried
to
free
himself
from
those
who
were
supporting
him
there
was
no
alternative
now
for
our
party
but
to
have
their
exhausted
comrade
carried
in
some
way
to
leyden
as
for
expecting
him
to
skate
anymore
that
day
the
thing
was
impossible
in
truth
by
this
time
each
boy
began
to
entertain
secret
yearnings
toward
iceboats
and
to
avow
a
spartan
resolve
not
to
desert
jacob
fortunately
a
gentle
steady
breeze
was
setting
southward
if
some
accommodating
schipper
would
but
come
along
matters
would
not
be
quite
so
bad
after
all
peter
hailed
the
first
sail
that
appeared
the
men
in
the
stern
would
not
even
look
at
him
three
drays
on
runners
came
along
but
they
were
already
loaded
to
the
utmost
then
an
iceboat
a
beautiful
tempting
little
one
whizzed
past
like
an
arrow
the
boys
had
just
time
to
stare
eagerly
at
it
when
it
was
gone
in
despair
they
resolved
to
prop
up
jacob
with
their
strong
arms
as
well
as
they
could
and
take
him
to
the
nearest
village
at
that
moment
a
very
shabby
iceboat
came
in
sight
with
but
little
hope
of
success
peter
hailed
at
it
at
the
same
time
taking
off
his
hat
and
flourishing
it
in
the
air
the
sail
was
lowered
then
came
the
scraping
sound
of
the
brake
and
a
pleasant
voice
called
from
the
deck
what
now
will
you
take
us
on
cried
peter
hurrying
with
his
companions
as
fast
as
he
could
for
the
boat
as
bringing
to
some
distance
ahead
will
you
take
us
on
we
ll
pay
for
the
ride
shouted
carl
the
man
on
board
scarcely
noticed
him
except
to
mutter
something
about
its
not
being
a
trekschuit
still
looking
toward
peter
he
asked
how
many
well
it
s
nicholas
s
day
up
with
you
young
gentleman
sick
he
nodded
toward
jacob
yes
broken
down
skated
all
the
way
from
broek
answered
peter
do
you
go
to
leyden
that
s
as
the
wind
says
it
s
blowing
that
way
now
scramble
up
poor
jacob
if
that
willing
poot
had
only
appeared
just
then
her
services
would
have
been
invaluable
it
was
as
much
as
the
boys
could
do
to
hoist
him
into
the
boat
all
were
in
at
last
the
schipper
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
let
out
the
sail
lifted
the
brake
and
sat
in
the
stern
with
folded
arms
whew
how
fast
we
go
cried
ben
this
is
something
like
feel
better
jacob
much
petter
i
tanks
oh
you
ll
be
as
good
as
new
in
ten
minutes
this
makes
a
fellow
feel
like
a
jacob
nodded
and
blinked
his
eyes
don
t
go
to
sleep
jacob
it
s
too
cold
you
might
never
wake
up
you
know
persons
often
freeze
to
death
in
that
i
no
sleep
said
jacob
confidently
and
in
two
minutes
he
was
snoring
carl
and
ludwig
laughed
we
must
wake
him
cried
ben
it
is
dangerous
i
tell
you
jacob
captain
peter
interfered
for
three
of
the
boys
were
helping
ben
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
nonsense
don
t
shake
him
let
him
alone
boys
one
never
snores
like
that
when
one
s
freezing
cover
him
up
with
something
here
this
cloak
will
do
hey
schipper
and
he
looked
toward
the
stern
for
permission
to
use
it
the
man
nodded
there
said
peter
tenderly
adjusting
the
garment
let
him
sleep
he
will
be
as
frisky
as
a
lamb
when
he
wakes
how
far
are
we
from
leyden
schipper
not
more
n
a
couple
of
pipes
replied
a
voice
rising
from
smoke
like
the
genii
in
fairy
tales
puff
puff
likely
not
more
n
one
an
a
half
puff
puff
if
this
wind
puff
puff
puff
what
is
the
man
saying
lambert
asked
ben
who
was
holding
his
mittened
hands
against
his
cheeks
to
ward
off
the
cutting
air
he
says
we
re
about
two
pipes
from
leyden
half
the
boors
here
on
the
canal
measure
distance
by
the
time
it
takes
them
to
finish
a
how
see
here
benjamin
dobbs
retorted
lambert
growing
unaccountably
indignant
at
ben
s
quiet
smile
see
here
you
ve
a
way
of
calling
every
other
thing
you
see
on
this
side
of
the
german
ocean
it
may
suit
you
this
word
but
it
doesn
t
suit
me
when
you
want
anything
ridiculous
just
remember
your
english
custom
of
making
the
lord
mayor
of
london
at
his
installation
count
the
nails
in
a
horseshoe
to
prove
his
who
told
you
we
had
any
such
custom
as
that
cried
ben
looking
grave
in
an
instant
why
i
know
it
no
use
of
anyone
telling
me
it
s
in
all
the
books
and
it
s
true
it
strikes
me
continued
lambert
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
that
you
have
been
kept
in
happy
ignorance
of
a
good
many
ridiculous
things
on
your
side
of
the
humph
exclaimed
ben
trying
not
to
smile
i
ll
inquire
into
that
lord
mayor
business
when
i
get
home
there
must
be
some
mistake
how
fast
we
re
going
this
is
glorious
it
was
a
grand
sail
or
ride
i
scarcely
know
which
to
call
it
perhaps
fly
would
be
the
best
word
for
the
boys
felt
very
much
as
sinbad
did
when
tied
to
the
roc
s
leg
he
darted
through
the
clouds
or
as
bellerophon
felt
when
he
shot
through
the
air
on
the
back
of
his
winged
horse
pegasus
sailing
riding
or
flying
whichever
it
was
everything
was
rushing
past
backward
and
before
they
had
time
to
draw
a
deep
breath
leyden
itself
with
its
high
peaked
roofs
flew
halfway
to
meet
them
when
the
city
came
in
sight
it
was
high
time
to
waken
the
sleeper
that
feat
accomplished
peter
s
prophecy
came
to
pass
master
jacob
was
quite
restored
and
in
excellent
spirits
the
schipper
made
a
feeble
remonstrance
when
peter
with
hearty
thanks
endeavored
to
slip
some
silver
pieces
into
his
tough
brown
palm
ye
see
young
master
said
he
drawing
away
his
hand
the
regular
line
o
trade
s
one
thing
and
a
favor
s
i
know
it
said
peter
but
those
boys
and
girls
of
yours
will
want
sweets
when
you
get
home
buy
them
some
in
the
name
of
saint
the
man
grinned
aye
true
enough
i
ve
young
uns
in
plenty
a
clean
boatload
of
them
you
are
a
sharp
young
master
at
this
time
the
knotty
hand
hitched
forward
again
quite
carelessly
it
seemed
but
its
palm
was
upward
peter
hastily
dropped
in
the
money
and
moved
away
the
sail
came
tumbling
down
scrape
scrape
went
the
brake
scattering
an
ice
shower
round
the
boat
schipper
shouted
the
boys
seizing
their
skates
and
leaping
from
the
deck
one
by
one
many
thanks
to
you
hold
here
stop
i
want
my
ben
was
carefully
assisting
his
cousin
over
the
side
of
the
boat
what
is
the
man
shouting
about
oh

know
you

answered
jacob
half
jumping
half
tumbling
down
upon
the

heavy
you

poot
ya

said
jacob
innocently
as
he
worked
himself
free
of
the
big
wrapper
dere
now

hands
it
mit
him
straits
way
and
tells
him
i
vos

tanks

for
an
inn
cried
peter
as
they
stepped
into
the
city
be
brisk
my
fine
fellows
mynheer
kleef
and
his
bill
of
fare
the
boys
soon
found
an
unpretending
establishment
near
the
breedstraat
broad
street
with
a
funnily
painted
lion
over
the
door
this
was
the
rood
leeuw
or
red
lion
kept
by
one
huygens
kleef
a
stout
dutchman
with
short
legs
and
a
very
long
pipe
by
this
time
they
were
in
a
ravenous
condition
the
tiffin
taken
at
haarlem
had
served
only
to
give
them
an
appetite
and
this
had
been
heightened
by
their
exercise
and
swift
sail
upon
the
canal
come
mine
host
give
us
what
you
can
cried
peter
rather
pompously
i
can
give
you
anything
everything
answered
mynheer
kleef
performing
a
difficult
bow
well
give
us
sausage
and
ah
mynheer
the
sausage
is
all
gone
there
is
no
salmagundi
then
and
plenty
of
that
is
out
also
young
eggs
and
be
winter
eggs
are
very
poor
eating
answered
the
innkeeper
puckering
his
lips
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
no
eggs
well
the
dutchman
raised
his
fat
hands
caviar
that
is
made
of
gold
who
has
caviar
to
sell
peter
had
sometimes
eaten
it
at
home
he
knew
that
it
was
made
of
the
roes
of
the
sturgeon
and
certain
other
large
fish
but
he
had
no
idea
of
its
cost
well
mine
host
what
have
you
what
have
i
everything
i
have
rye
bread
sauerkraut
potato
salad
and
the
fattest
herring
in
what
do
you
say
boys
asked
the
captain
will
that
do
yes
cried
the
famished
youths
if
he
ll
only
be
mynheer
moved
off
like
one
walking
in
his
sleep
but
soon
opened
his
eyes
wide
at
the
miraculous
manner
in
which
his
herring
were
made
to
disappear
next
came
or
rather
went
potato
salad
rye
bread
and
coffee
then
utrecht
water
flavored
with
orange
and
finally
slices
of
dry
gingerbread
this
last
delicacy
was
not
on
the
regular
bill
of
fare
but
mynheer
kleef
driven
to
extremes
solemnly
produced
it
from
his
own
private
stores
and
gave
only
a
placid
blink
when
his
voracious
young
travelers
started
up
declaring
they
had
eaten
enough
i
should
think
so
he
exclaimed
internally
but
his
smooth
face
gave
no
sign
softly
rubbing
his
hands
he
asked
will
your
worships
have
beds
will
your
worships
have
beds
mocked
carl
what
do
you
mean
do
we
look
sleepy
not
at
all
master
but
i
would
cause
them
to
be
warmed
and
aired
none
sleep
under
damp
sheets
at
the
red
ah
i
understand
shall
we
come
back
here
to
sleep
captain
peter
was
accustomed
to
finer
lodgings
but
this
was
a
frolic
why
not
he
replied
we
can
fare
excellently
your
worship
speaks
only
the
truth
said
mynheer
with
great
deference
how
fine
to
be
called
your
worship
laughed
ludwig
aside
to
lambert
while
peter
replied
well
mine
host
you
may
get
the
rooms
ready
by
i
have
one
beautiful
chamber
with
three
beds
that
will
hold
all
of
your
worships
said
mynheer
kleef
coaxingly
that
will
whew
whistled
carl
when
they
reached
the
street
ludwig
startled
what
now
nothing
only
mynheer
kleef
of
the
red
lion
little
thinks
how
we
shall
make
things
spin
in
that
same
room
tonight
we
ll
set
the
bolsters
flying
order
cried
the
captain
now
boys
i
must
seek
this
great
boekman
before
i
sleep
if
he
is
in
leyden
it
will
be
no
great
task
to
find
him
for
he
always
puts
up
at
the
golden
eagle
when
he
comes
here
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
all
go
to
bed
at
once
still
as
you
are
awake
what
say
you
to
walking
with
ben
up
by
the
museum
or
the
stadhuis
agreed
said
ludwig
and
lambert
but
jacob
preferred
to
go
with
peter
in
vain
ben
tried
to
persuade
him
to
remain
at
the
inn
and
rest
he
declared
that
he
never
felt
petter
and
wished
of
all
things
to
take
a
look
at
the
city
for
it
was
his
first
stop
mit
oh
it
will
not
harm
him
said
lambert
how
long
the
day
has
been
and
what
glorious
sport
we
have
had
it
hardly
seems
possible
that
we
left
broek
only
this
jacob
yawned
i
have
enjoyed
it
well
he
said
but
it
seems
to
me
at
least
a
week
since
we
carl
laughed
and
muttered
something
about
twenty
here
we
are
at
the
corner
remember
we
all
meet
at
the
red
lion
at
eight
said
the
captain
as
he
and
jacob
walked
away
the
red
lion
becomes
dangerous
the
boys
were
glad
to
find
a
blazing
fire
awaiting
them
upon
their
return
to
the
red
lion
carl
and
his
party
were
there
first
soon
afterward
peter
and
jacob
came
in
they
had
inquired
in
vain
concerning
boekman
all
they
could
ascertain
was
that
he
had
been
seen
in
haarlem
that
morning
as
for
his
being
in
leyden
the
landlord
of
the
golden
eagle
had
said
to
peter
the
thing
is
impossible
he
always
lodges
here
when
in
town
by
this
time
there
would
be
a
crowd
at
my
door
waiting
to
consult
him
bah
people
make
such
fools
of
themselves
he
is
called
a
great
surgeon
said
peter
yes
the
greatest
in
holland
but
what
of
that
what
of
being
the
greatest
pill
choker
and
knife
slasher
in
the
world
the
man
is
a
bear
only
last
month
on
this
very
spot
he
called
me
a
pig
before
three
customers
no
exclaimed
peter
trying
to
look
surprised
and
indignant
yes
master
a
pig
repeated
the
landlord
puffing
at
his
pipe
with
an
injured
air
bah
if
he
did
not
pay
fine
prices
and
bring
customers
to
my
house
i
would
sooner
see
him
in
the
vleit
canal
than
give
him
perhaps
mine
host
felt
that
he
was
speaking
too
openly
to
a
stranger
or
it
may
be
he
saw
a
smile
lurking
in
peter
s
face
for
he
added
sharply
come
now
what
more
do
you
wish
supper
beds
no
mynheer
i
am
but
searching
for
go
find
him
he
is
not
in
peter
was
not
to
be
put
off
so
easily
he
succeeded
in
obtaining
permission
to
leave
a
note
for
the
famous
surgeon
or
rather
he
bought
from
his
amiable
landlord
the
privilege
of
writing
it
there
and
a
promise
that
it
should
be
promptly
delivered
when
boekman
arrived
this
accomplished
peter
and
jacob
returned
to
the
red
lion
this
inn
had
once
been
a
fine
house
the
home
of
a
rich
burgher
but
having
grown
old
and
shabby
it
had
passed
through
many
hands
until
finally
it
had
fallen
into
the
possession
of
mynheer
kleef
he
was
fond
of
saying
as
he
looked
up
at
its
dingy
broken
walls
mend
it
and
paint
it
and
there
s
not
a
prettier
house
in
it
stood
six
stories
high
from
the
street
the
first
three
were
of
equal
breadth
but
of
various
heights
the
last
three
were
in
the
great
high
roof
and
grew
smaller
and
smaller
like
a
set
of
double
steps
until
the
top
one
was
lost
in
a
point
the
roof
was
built
of
short
shining
tiles
and
the
windows
with
their
little
panes
seemed
to
be
scattered
irregularly
over
the
face
of
the
building
without
the
slightest
attention
to
outward
effect
but
the
public
room
on
the
ground
floor
was
the
landlord
s
joy
and
pride
he
never
said
mend
it
and
paint
it
there
for
everything
was
in
the
highest
condition
of
dutch
neatness
and
order
if
you
will
but
open
your
mind
s
eye
you
may
look
into
the
apartment
imagine
a
large
bare
room
with
a
floor
that
seemed
to
be
made
of
squares
cut
out
of
glazed
earthen
first
a
yellow
piece
then
a
red
until
the
whole
looked
like
a
vast
checkerboard
fancy
a
dozen
wooden
chairs
standing
around
then
a
great
hollow
chimney
place
all
aglow
with
its
blazing
fire
reflected
a
hundred
times
in
the
polished
steel
firedogs
a
tiled
hearth
tiled
sides
tiled
top
with
a
dutch
sentence
upon
it
and
over
all
high
above
one
s
head
a
narrow
mantleshelf
filled
with
shining
brass
candlesticks
pipe
lighters
and
tinderboxes
then
see
in
one
end
of
the
room
three
pine
tables
in
the
other
a
closet
and
a
deal
dresser
the
latter
is
filled
with
mugs
dishes
pipes
tankards
earthen
and
glass
bottles
and
is
guarded
at
one
end
by
a
keg
standing
upon
long
legs
everything
is
dim
with
tobacco
smoke
but
otherwise
as
clean
as
soap
and
sand
can
make
it
next
picture
two
sleepy
men
in
wooden
shoes
seated
near
the
glowing
fireplace
hugging
their
knees
and
smoking
short
stumpy
pipes
mynheer
kleef
walking
softly
and
heavily
about
clad
in
leather
knee
breeches
felt
shoes
and
a
green
jacket
wider
than
it
is
long
then
throw
a
heap
of
skates
in
the
corner
and
put
six
tired
boys
in
various
attitudes
upon
the
wooden
chairs
and
you
will
see
the
coffee
room
of
the
red
lion
just
as
it
appeared
at
nine
o
clock
upon
the
evening
of
december
for
supper
gingerbread
again
slices
of
dutch
sausage
rye
bread
sprinkled
with
anise
seed
pickles
a
bottle
of
utrecht
water
and
a
pot
of
very
mysterious
coffee
the
boys
were
ravenous
enough
to
take
all
they
could
get
and
pronounce
it
excellent
ben
made
wry
faces
but
jacob
declared
he
had
never
eaten
a
better
meal
after
they
had
laughed
and
talked
awhile
and
counted
their
money
by
way
of
settling
a
discussion
that
arose
concerning
their
expenses
the
captain
marched
his
company
off
to
bed
led
on
by
a
greasy
pioneer
boy
who
carried
skates
and
a
candlestick
instead
of
an
ax
one
of
the
men
by
the
fire
had
shuffled
toward
the
dresser
and
was
ordering
a
mug
of
beer
just
as
ludwig
who
brought
up
the
rear
was
stepping
from
the
apartment
i
don
t
like
that
fellow
s
eye
he
whispered
to
carl
he
looks
like
a
pirate
or
something
of
that
looks
like
a
granny
answered
carl
in
sleepy
disdain
ludwig
laughed
uneasily
granny
or
no
granny
he
whispered
i
tell
you
he
looks
just
like
one
of
those
men
in
the
pooh
sneered
carl
i
knew
it
that
picture
was
too
much
for
you
look
sharp
now
and
see
if
yon
fellow
with
the
candle
doesn
t
look
like
the
other
no
indeed
his
face
is
as
honest
as
a
gouda
cheese
but
i
say
carl
that
really
was
a
horrid
humph
what
did
you
stare
at
it
so
long
for
i
couldn
t
help
by
this
time
the
boys
had
reached
the
beautiful
room
with
three
beds
in
a
dumpy
little
maiden
with
long
earrings
met
them
at
the
doorway
dropped
them
a
curtsy
and
passed
out
she
carried
a
thing
that
resembled
a
frying
pan
with
a
cover
i
am
glad
to
see
that
said
van
mounen
to
ben
what
why
the
warming
pan
it
s
full
of
hot
ashes
she
s
been
heating
our
oh
a
warming
pan
eh
much
obliged
to
her
i
m
sure
said
ben
too
sleepy
to
make
any
further
comment
meantime
ludwig
still
talked
of
the
picture
that
had
made
such
a
strong
impression
upon
him
he
had
seen
it
in
a
shop
window
during
their
walk
it
was
a
poorly
painted
thing
representing
two
men
tied
back
to
back
standing
on
shipboard
surrounded
by
a
group
of
seamen
who
were
preparing
to
cast
them
together
into
the
sea
this
mode
of
putting
prisoners
to
death
was
called
voetspoelen
or
feet
washing
and
was
practiced
by
the
dutch
upon
the
pirates
of
dunkirk
in
and
again
by
the
spaniards
against
the
dutch
in
the
horrible
massacre
that
followed
the
siege
of
haarlem
bad
as
the
painting
was
the
expression
upon
the
pirates
faces
was
well
given
sullen
and
despairing
as
they
seemed
they
wore
such
a
cruel
malignant
aspect
that
ludwig
had
felt
a
secret
satisfaction
in
contemplating
their
helpless
condition
he
might
have
forgotten
the
scene
by
this
time
but
for
that
man
by
the
fire
now
while
he
capered
about
boylike
and
threw
himself
with
an
antic
into
his
bed
he
inwardly
hoped
that
the
voetspoelen
would
not
haunt
his
dreams
it
was
a
cold
cheerless
room
a
fire
had
been
newly
kindled
in
the
burnished
stove
and
seemed
to
shiver
even
while
it
was
trying
to
burn
the
windows
with
their
funny
little
panes
were
bare
and
shiny
and
the
cold
waxed
floor
looked
like
a
sheet
of
yellow
ice
three
chairs
stood
stiffly
against
the
wall
alternating
with
three
narrow
wooden
bedsteads
that
made
the
room
look
like
the
deserted
ward
of
a
hospital
at
any
other
time
the
boys
would
have
found
it
quite
impossible
to
sleep
in
pairs
especially
in
such
narrow
quarters
but
tonight
they
lost
all
fear
of
being
crowded
and
longed
only
to
lay
their
weary
bodies
upon
the
feather
beds
that
lay
lightly
upon
each
cot
had
the
boys
been
in
germany
instead
of
holland
they
might
have
been
covered
also
by
a
bed
of
down
or
feathers
this
peculiar
form
of
luxury
was
at
that
time
adopted
only
by
wealthy
or
eccentric
hollanders
ludwig
as
we
have
seen
had
not
quite
lost
his
friskiness
but
the
other
boys
after
one
or
two
feeble
attempts
at
pillow
firing
composed
themselves
for
the
night
with
the
greatest
dignity
nothing
like
fatigue
for
making
boys
behave
themselves
good
night
boys
said
peter
s
voice
from
under
the
covers
good
night
called
back
everybody
but
jacob
who
already
lay
snoring
beside
the
captain
i
say
shouted
carl
after
a
moment
don
t
sneeze
anybody
ludwig
s
in
a
fright
no
such
thing
retorted
ludwig
in
a
smothered
voice
then
there
was
a
little
whispered
dispute
which
was
ended
by
carl
saying
for
my
part
i
don
t
know
what
fear
is
but
you
really
are
a
timid
fellow
ludwig
grunted
sleepily
but
made
no
further
reply
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
the
fire
had
shivered
itself
to
death
and
in
place
of
its
gleams
little
squares
of
moonlight
lay
upon
the
floor
slowly
slowly
shifting
their
way
across
the
room
something
else
was
moving
also
but
the
boys
did
not
see
it
sleeping
boys
keep
but
a
poor
lookout
during
the
early
hours
of
the
night
jacob
poot
had
been
gradually
but
surely
winding
himself
with
all
the
bed
covers
he
now
lay
like
a
monster
chrysalis
beside
the
peter
who
accordingly
was
skating
with
all
his
might
over
the
coldest
bleakest
of
dreamland
icebergs
something
else
i
say
besides
the
moonlight
was
moving
across
the
bare
polished
floor
moving
not
quite
so
slowly
but
quite
as
stealthily
wake
up
ludwig
the
voetspoelen
is
growing
real
no
ludwig
does
not
waken
but
he
moans
in
his
sleep
does
not
carl
hear
it
carl
the
brave
the
fearless
no
carl
is
dreaming
of
the
race
and
jacob
van
mounen
ben
not
they
they
too
are
dreaming
of
the
race
and
katrinka
is
singing
through
their
dreams
laughing
flitting
past
them
now
and
then
a
wave
from
the
great
organ
surges
through
their
midst
still
the
thing
moves
slowly
slowly
peter
captain
peter
there
is
danger
peter
heard
no
call
but
in
his
dream
he
slid
a
few
thousand
feet
from
one
iceberg
to
another
and
the
shock
awoke
him
whew
how
cold
he
was
he
gave
a
hopeless
desperate
tug
at
the
chrysalis
in
vain
sheet
blanket
and
spread
were
firmly
wound
around
jacob
s
inanimate
form
clear
moonlight
he
thought
we
shall
have
pleasant
weather
tomorrow
halloo
what
s
that
he
saw
the
moving
thing
or
rather
something
black
crouching
upon
the
floor
for
it
had
halted
as
peter
stirred
he
watched
in
silence
soon
it
moved
again
nearer
and
nearer
it
was
a
man
crawling
upon
hands
and
feet
the
captain
s
first
impulse
was
to
call
out
but
he
took
an
instant
to
consider
matters
the
creeper
had
a
shining
knife
in
one
hand
this
was
ugly
but
peter
was
naturally
when
the
head
turned
peter
s
eyes
were
closed
as
if
in
sleep
but
at
other
times
nothing
could
be
keener
sharper
than
the
captain
s
gaze
closer
closer
crept
the
robber
his
back
was
very
near
peter
now
the
knife
was
laid
softly
upon
the
floor
one
careful
arm
reached
forth
stealthily
to
drag
the
clothes
from
the
chair
by
the
captain
s
bed
the
robbery
was
commenced
now
was
peter
s
time
holding
his
breath
he
sprang
up
and
leaped
with
all
his
strength
upon
the
robber
s
back
stunning
the
rascal
with
the
force
of
the
blow
to
seize
the
knife
was
but
a
second
s
work
the
robber
began
to
struggle
but
peter
sat
like
a
giant
astride
the
prostrate
form
if
you
stir
said
the
brave
boy
in
as
terrible
a
voice
as
he
could
command
stir
but
one
inch
i
will
plunge
this
knife
into
your
neck
boys
boys
wake
up
he
shouted
still
pressing
down
the
black
head
and
holding
the
knife
at
pricking
distance
give
us
a
hand
i
ve
got
him
the
chrysalis
rolled
over
but
made
no
other
sign
up
boys
cried
peter
never
budging
ludwig
lambert
donder
are
you
all
dead
dead
not
they
van
mounen
and
ben
were
on
their
feet
in
an
instant
hey
what
now
they
shouted
i
ve
got
a
robber
here
said
peter
coolly
lie
still
you
scoundrel
or
i
ll
slice
your
head
off
now
boys
cut
out
your
bed
cord
plenty
of
time
he
s
a
dead
man
if
he
peter
felt
that
he
weighed
a
thousand
pounds
so
he
did
with
that
knife
in
his
hand
the
man
growled
and
swore
but
dared
not
move
ludwig
was
up
by
this
time
he
had
a
great
jackknife
the
pride
of
his
heart
in
his
breeches
pocket
it
could
do
good
service
now
they
bared
the
bedstead
in
a
moment
it
was
laced
backward
and
forward
with
a
rope
i
ll
cut
it
cried
ludwig
sawing
away
at
the
knot
hold
him
tight
peter
never
fear
answered
the
captain
giving
the
robber
a
warning
prick
the
boys
were
soon
pulling
at
the
rope
like
good
fellows
it
was
out
at
last
a
long
stout
piece
now
boys
commanded
the
captain
lift
up
his
rascally
arms
cross
his
hands
over
his
back
that
s
right
excuse
me
for
being
in
the
way
tie
them
tight
yes
and
his
feet
too
the
villain
cried
the
boys
in
great
excitement
tying
knot
after
knot
with
herculean
jerks
the
prisoner
changed
his
tone
oh
oh
he
moaned
spare
a
poor
sick
man
i
was
but
walking
in
my
ugh
grunted
lambert
still
tugging
away
at
the
rope
asleep
were
you
well
we
ll
wake
you
the
man
muttered
fierce
oaths
between
his
teeth
then
cried
in
a
piteous
voice
unbind
me
good
young
masters
i
have
five
little
children
at
home
by
saint
bavon
i
swear
to
give
you
each
a
piece
if
you
will
but
free
me
ha
ha
laughed
peter
ha
ha
laughed
the
other
boys
then
came
threats
threats
that
made
ludwig
fairly
shudder
though
he
continued
to
bind
and
tie
with
redoubled
energy
hold
up
mynheer
housebreaker
said
van
mounen
in
a
warning
voice
that
knife
is
very
near
your
throat
if
you
make
the
captain
nervous
there
is
no
telling
what
may
the
robber
took
the
hint
and
fell
into
a
sullen
silence
just
at
this
moment
the
chrysalis
upon
the
bed
stirred
and
sat
erect
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
without
opening
his
eyes
matter
echoed
ludwig
half
trembling
half
laughing
get
up
jacob
here
s
work
for
you
come
sit
on
this
fellow
s
back
while
we
get
into
our
clothes
we
re
half
what
fellow
donder
hurrah
for
poot
cried
all
the
boys
as
jacob
sliding
quickly
to
the
floor
bedclothes
and
all
took
in
the
state
of
affairs
at
a
glance
and
sat
heavily
beside
peter
on
the
robber
s
back
oh
didn
t
the
fellow
groan
then
no
use
in
holding
him
down
any
longer
boys
said
peter
rising
but
bending
as
he
did
so
to
draw
a
pistol
from
the
man
s
belt
you
see
i
ve
been
keeping
a
guard
over
this
pretty
little
weapon
for
the
last
ten
minutes
it
s
cocked
and
the
least
wriggle
might
have
set
it
off
no
danger
now
i
must
dress
myself
you
and
i
lambert
will
go
for
the
police
i
d
no
idea
it
was
so
where
is
carl
asked
one
of
the
boys
they
looked
at
one
another
carl
certainly
was
not
among
them
oh
cried
ludwig
frightened
at
last
where
is
he
perhaps
he
s
had
a
fight
with
the
robber
and
got
not
a
bit
of
it
said
peter
quietly
as
he
buttoned
his
stout
jacket
look
under
the
they
did
so
carl
was
not
there
just
then
they
heard
a
commotion
on
the
stairway
ben
hastened
to
open
the
door
the
landlord
almost
tumbled
in
he
was
armed
with
a
big
blunderbuss
two
or
three
lodgers
followed
then
the
daughter
with
an
upraised
frying
pan
in
one
hand
and
a
candle
in
the
other
and
behind
her
looking
pale
and
frightened
the
gallant
carl
there
s
your
man
mine
host
said
peter
nodding
toward
the
prisoner
mine
host
raised
his
blunderbuss
the
girl
screamed
and
jacob
more
nimble
than
usual
rolled
quickly
from
the
robber
s
back
don
t
fire
cried
peter
he
is
tied
hand
and
foot
let
s
roll
him
over
and
see
what
he
looks
carl
stepped
briskly
forward
with
a
bluster
yes
we
ll
turn
him
over
in
a
way
he
won
t
like
lucky
we
ve
caught
him
ha
ha
laughed
ludwig
where
were
you
master
carl
where
was
i
retorted
carl
angrily
why
i
went
to
give
the
alarm
to
be
sure
all
the
boys
exchanged
glances
but
they
were
too
happy
and
elated
to
say
anything
carl
certainly
was
bold
enough
now
he
took
the
lead
while
three
others
aided
him
in
turning
the
helpless
man
while
the
robber
lay
faceup
scowling
and
muttering
ludwig
took
the
candlestick
from
the
girl
s
hand
i
must
have
a
good
look
at
the
beauty
he
said
drawing
closer
but
the
words
were
no
sooner
spoken
than
he
turned
pale
and
started
so
violently
that
he
almost
dropped
the
candle
the
voetspoelen
he
cried
why
boys
it
s
the
man
who
sat
by
the
fire
of
course
it
is
answered
peter
we
counted
out
money
before
him
like
simpletons
but
what
have
we
to
do
with
voetspoelen
brother
ludwig
a
month
in
jail
is
punishment
the
landlord
s
daughter
had
left
the
room
she
now
ran
in
holding
up
a
pair
of
huge
wooden
shoes
see
father
she
cried
here
are
his
great
ugly
boats
it
s
the
man
that
we
put
in
the
next
room
after
the
young
masters
went
to
bed
ah
it
was
wrong
to
send
the
poor
young
gentlemen
up
here
so
far
out
of
sight
and
the
scoundrel
hissed
the
landlord
he
has
disgraced
my
house
i
go
for
the
police
at
once
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
two
officers
were
in
the
room
after
telling
mynheer
kleef
that
he
must
appear
early
in
the
morning
with
the
boys
and
make
his
complaint
before
a
magistrate
they
marched
off
with
their
prisoner
one
would
think
the
captain
and
his
band
could
have
slept
no
more
that
night
but
the
mooring
has
not
yet
been
found
that
can
prevent
youth
and
an
easy
conscience
from
drifting
down
the
river
of
dreams
the
boys
were
much
too
fatigued
to
let
so
slight
a
thing
as
capturing
a
robber
bind
them
to
wakefulness
they
were
soon
in
bed
again
floating
away
to
strange
scenes
made
of
familiar
things
ludwig
and
carl
had
spread
their
bedding
upon
the
floor
one
had
already
forgotten
the
voetspoelen
the
race
everything
but
carl
was
he
heard
the
carillons
ringing
out
their
solemn
nightly
music
and
the
watchman
s
noisy
clapper
putting
in
discord
at
the
quarter
hours
he
saw
the
moonshine
glide
away
from
the
window
and
the
red
morning
light
come
pouring
in
and
all
the
while
he
kept
thinking
pooh
what
a
goose
i
have
made
of
myself
carl
schummel
alone
with
none
to
look
or
to
listen
was
not
quite
so
grand
a
fellow
as
carl
schummel
strutting
about
in
his
boots
before
the
court
you
may
believe
that
the
landlord
s
daughter
bestirred
herself
to
prepare
a
good
meal
for
the
boys
next
morning
mynheer
had
a
chinese
gong
that
could
make
more
noise
than
a
dozen
breakfast
bells
its
hideous
reveille
clanging
through
the
house
generally
startled
the
drowsiest
lodgers
into
activity
but
the
maiden
would
not
allow
it
to
be
sounded
this
morning
let
the
brave
young
gentlemen
sleep
she
said
to
the
greasy
kitchen
boy
they
shall
be
warmly
fed
when
they
it
was
ten
o
clock
when
captain
peter
and
his
band
came
straggling
down
one
by
one
a
pretty
hour
said
mine
host
gruffly
it
is
high
time
we
were
before
the
court
fine
business
this
for
a
respectable
inn
you
will
testify
truly
young
masters
that
you
found
most
excellent
fare
and
lodging
at
the
red
lion
of
course
we
will
answered
carl
saucily
and
pleasant
company
too
though
they
visit
at
rather
unseasonable
a
stare
and
a
humph
was
all
the
answer
mynheer
made
to
this
but
the
daughter
was
more
communicative
shaking
her
earrings
at
carl
she
said
sharply
not
so
very
pleasant
either
master
traveler
if
you
could
judge
by
the
way
you
ran
away
from
it
impertinent
creature
hissed
carl
under
his
breath
as
he
began
busily
to
examine
his
skate
straps
meantime
the
kitchen
boy
listening
outside
at
the
crack
of
the
door
doubled
himself
with
silent
laughter
after
breakfast
the
boys
went
to
the
police
court
accompanied
by
huygens
kleef
and
his
daughter
mynheer
s
testimony
was
principally
to
the
effect
that
such
a
thing
as
a
robber
at
the
red
lion
had
been
unheard
of
until
last
night
and
as
for
the
red
lion
it
was
a
most
respectable
inn
as
respectable
as
any
house
in
leyden
each
boy
in
turn
told
all
that
he
knew
of
the
affair
and
identified
the
prisoner
in
the
box
as
the
same
man
who
entered
their
room
in
the
dead
of
night
ludwig
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
prisoner
in
the
box
was
a
man
of
ordinary
size
especially
after
he
had
described
him
under
oath
to
the
court
as
a
tremendous
fellow
with
great
square
shoulders
and
legs
of
prodigious
weight
jacob
swore
that
he
was
awakened
by
the
robber
kicking
and
thrashing
upon
the
floor
and
immediately
afterward
peter
and
the
rest
feeling
sorry
that
they
had
not
explained
the
matter
to
their
sleepy
comrade
testified
that
the
man
had
not
moved
a
muscle
from
the
moment
the
point
of
the
dagger
touched
his
throat
until
bound
from
head
to
foot
he
was
rolled
over
for
inspection
the
landlord
s
daughter
made
one
boy
blush
and
all
the
court
smile
by
declaring
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
handsome
young
gentleman
there
pointing
to
peter
they
might
have
all
been
murdered
in
their
beds
for
the
dreadful
man
had
a
great
shining
knife
most
as
long
as
your
honor
s
arm
and
she
believed
the
handsome
young
gentleman
had
struggled
hard
enough
to
get
it
away
from
him
but
he
was
too
modest
bless
him
to
say
finally
after
a
little
questioning
and
from
the
public
prosecutor
the
witnesses
were
dismissed
and
the
robber
was
handed
over
to
the
consideration
of
the
criminal
court
the
scoundrel
said
carl
savagely
when
the
boys
reached
the
street
he
ought
to
be
sent
to
jail
at
once
if
i
had
been
in
your
place
peter
i
certainly
should
have
killed
him
outright
he
was
fortunate
then
in
falling
into
gentler
hands
was
peter
s
quiet
reply
it
appears
he
has
been
arrested
before
under
a
charge
of
housebreaking
he
did
not
succeed
in
robbing
this
time
but
he
broke
the
and
that
i
believe
constitutes
a
burglary
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
was
armed
with
a
knife
too
and
that
makes
it
worse
for
him
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
mimicked
carl
one
would
think
he
was
your
brother
so
he
is
my
brother
and
yours
too
carl
schummel
for
that
matter
answered
peter
looking
into
carl
s
eye
we
can
not
say
what
we
might
have
become
under
other
circumstances
we
have
been
bolstered
up
from
evil
since
the
hour
we
were
born
a
happy
home
and
good
parents
might
have
made
that
man
a
fine
fellow
instead
of
what
he
is
god
grant
that
the
law
may
cure
and
not
crush
him
amen
to
that
said
lambert
heartily
while
ludwig
van
holp
looked
at
his
brother
in
such
a
bright
proud
way
that
jacob
poot
who
was
an
only
son
wished
from
his
heart
that
the
little
form
buried
in
the
old
church
at
home
had
lived
to
grow
up
beside
him
humph
said
carl
it
s
all
very
well
to
be
saintly
and
forgiving
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
m
naturally
hard
all
these
fine
ideas
seem
to
rattle
off
me
like
hailstones
and
it
s
nobody
s
business
either
if
they
peter
recognized
a
touch
of
good
feeling
in
this
clumsy
concession
holding
out
his
hand
he
said
in
a
frank
hearty
tone
come
lad
shake
hands
and
let
us
be
good
friends
even
if
we
don
t
exactly
agree
on
all
we
do
agree
better
than
you
think
sulked
carl
as
he
returned
peter
s
grasp
all
right
responded
peter
briskly
now
van
mounen
we
await
benjamin
s
wishes
where
would
he
like
to
go
to
the
egyptian
museum
answered
lambert
after
holding
a
brief
consultation
with
ben
that
is
on
the
breedstraat
to
the
museum
let
it
be
come
boys
the
beleaguered
cities
this
open
square
before
us
said
lambert
as
he
and
ben
walked
on
together
is
pretty
in
summer
with
its
shady
trees
they
call
it
the
ruine
years
ago
it
was
covered
with
houses
and
the
rapenburg
canal
here
ran
through
the
street
well
one
day
a
barge
loaded
with
forty
thousand
pounds
of
gunpowder
bound
for
delft
was
lying
alongside
and
the
bargemen
took
a
notion
to
cook
their
dinner
on
the
deck
and
before
anyone
knew
it
sir
the
whole
thing
blew
up
killing
lots
of
persons
and
scattering
about
three
hundred
houses
to
the
what
exclaimed
ben
did
the
explosion
destroy
three
hundred
houses
yes
sir
my
father
was
in
leyden
at
the
time
he
says
it
was
terrible
the
explosion
occurred
just
at
noon
and
it
was
like
a
volcano
all
this
part
of
the
town
was
on
fire
in
an
instant
buildings
tumbling
down
and
men
women
and
children
groaning
under
the
ruins
the
king
himself
came
to
the
city
and
acted
nobly
father
says
staying
out
in
the
streets
all
night
encouraging
the
survivors
in
their
efforts
to
arrest
the
fire
and
rescue
as
many
as
possible
from
under
the
heaps
of
stone
and
rubbish
through
his
means
a
collection
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
was
raised
throughout
the
kingdom
besides
a
hundred
thousand
guilders
paid
out
of
the
treasury
father
was
only
nineteen
years
old
then
it
was
in
i
believe
but
he
remembers
it
perfectly
a
friend
of
his
professor
luzac
was
among
the
killed
they
have
a
tablet
erected
to
his
memory
in
saint
peter
s
church
farther
on
the
queerest
thing
you
ever
saw
with
an
image
of
the
professor
carved
upon
it
representing
him
just
as
he
looked
when
he
was
found
after
the
what
a
strange
idea
isn
t
boerhaave
s
monument
in
saint
peter
s
also
i
can
not
remember
perhaps
peter
the
captain
delighted
ben
by
saying
that
the
monument
was
there
and
that
he
thought
they
might
be
able
to
see
it
during
the
day
lambert
continued
peter
ask
ben
if
he
saw
van
der
werf
s
portrait
at
the
town
hall
last
night
no
said
lambert
i
can
answer
for
him
it
was
too
late
to
go
in
i
say
boys
it
is
really
wonderful
how
much
ben
knows
why
he
has
told
me
a
volume
of
dutch
history
already
i
ll
wager
he
has
the
siege
of
leyden
at
his
tongue
s
his
tongue
must
burn
then
interposed
ludwig
for
if
bilderdyk
s
account
is
true
it
was
a
pretty
hot
ben
was
looking
at
them
with
an
inquiring
smile
we
are
speaking
of
the
siege
of
leyden
explained
lambert
oh
yes
said
ben
eagerly
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
this
was
the
very
place
let
s
give
old
van
der
werf
three
cheers
hur
van
mounen
uttered
a
hasty
hush
and
explained
that
patriotic
as
the
dutch
were
the
police
would
soon
have
something
to
say
if
a
party
of
boys
cheered
in
the
street
at
midday
what
not
cheer
van
der
werf
cried
ben
indignantly
one
of
the
greatest
chaps
in
history
only
think
didn
t
he
hold
out
against
those
murderous
spaniards
for
months
and
months
there
was
the
town
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
enemy
great
black
forts
sending
fire
and
death
into
the
very
heart
of
the
city
but
no
surrender
every
man
a
hero
women
and
children
too
brave
and
fierce
as
lions
provisions
giving
out
the
very
grass
from
between
the
paving
stones
gone
till
people
were
glad
to
eat
horses
and
cats
and
dogs
and
rats
then
came
the
plague
hundreds
dying
in
the
streets
but
no
surrender
then
when
they
could
bear
no
more
when
the
people
brave
as
they
were
crowded
about
van
der
werf
in
the
public
square
begging
him
to
give
up
what
did
the
noble
old
burgomaster
say
i
have
sworn
to
defend
this
city
and
with
god
s
help
i
mean
to
do
it
if
my
body
can
satisfy
your
hunger
take
it
and
divide
it
among
you
but
expect
no
surrender
so
long
as
i
am
hurrah
hur
ben
was
getting
uproarious
lambert
playfully
clapped
his
hand
over
his
friend
s
mouth
the
result
was
one
of
those
quick
scuffles
fearful
to
behold
but
delightful
to
human
nature
in
its
polliwog
state
vat

jacob
hurrying
forward

mit

no
no
no
i
said
he
defended
the
city
like
a
brick
that
is
very
high
praise
i
would
have
you
understand
we
english
call
even
the
duke
of
wellington
a
jacob
looked
puzzled
but
his
indignation
was
already
on
the
ebb
vell
it
ish
no
matter
i
no
tink
before
soltyer

breek
but
it
ish
no
ben
laughed
and
seeing
that
his
cousin
was
tired
of
talking
in
english
he
turned
to
his
friend
of
the
two
languages
van
mounen
they
say
the
very
carrier
pigeons
that
brought
news
of
relief
to
the
besieged
city
are
somewhere
here
in
leyden
i
really
should
like
to
see
them
just
think
of
it
at
the
very
height
of
the
trouble
if
the
wind
didn
t
turn
and
blow
in
the
waters
and
drown
hundreds
of
spaniards
and
enable
the
dutch
boats
to
sail
in
right
over
the
land
with
men
and
provisions
to
the
very
gates
of
the
city
the
pigeons
you
know
did
great
service
in
bearing
letters
to
and
fro
i
have
read
somewhere
that
they
were
reverently
cared
for
from
that
day
and
when
they
died
they
were
stuffed
and
placed
for
safekeeping
in
the
town
hall
we
must
be
sure
to
have
a
look
at
van
mounen
laughed
on
that
principle
ben
i
suppose
when
you
go
to
rome
you
ll
expect
to
see
the
identical
goose
who
saved
the
capitol
but
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
see
the
pigeons
they
are
in
the
same
building
with
van
der
werf
s
portrait
which
was
the
greater
defense
ben
the
siege
of
leyden
or
the
siege
of
haarlem
well
replied
ben
thoughtfully
van
der
werf
is
one
of
my
heroes
we
all
have
our
historical
pets
you
know
but
i
really
think
the
siege
of
haarlem
brought
out
a
braver
more
heroic
resistance
even
than
the
leyden
one
besides
they
set
the
leyden
sufferers
an
example
of
courage
and
fortitude
for
their
turn
came
i
don
t
know
much
about
the
haarlem
siege
said
lambert
except
that
it
was
in
who
beat
the
spaniards
said
ben
the
dutch
had
stood
out
for
months
not
a
man
would
yield
nor
a
woman
either
for
that
matter
they
shouldered
arms
and
fought
gallantly
beside
their
husbands
and
fathers
three
hundred
of
them
did
duty
under
kanau
hesselaer
a
great
woman
and
brave
as
joan
of
arc
all
this
time
the
city
was
surrounded
by
the
spaniards
under
frederic
of
toledo
son
of
that
beauty
the
duke
of
alva
cut
off
from
all
possible
help
from
without
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
for
the
inhabitants
but
they
shouted
defiance
over
the
city
walls
they
even
threw
bread
into
the
enemy
s
camps
to
show
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
starvation
up
to
the
last
they
held
out
bravely
waiting
for
the
help
that
never
could
come
growing
bolder
and
bolder
until
their
provisions
were
exhausted
then
it
was
terrible
in
time
hundreds
of
famished
creatures
fell
dead
in
the
streets
and
the
living
had
scarcely
strength
to
bury
them
at
last
they
made
the
desperate
resolution
that
rather
than
perish
by
lingering
torture
the
strongest
would
form
a
square
placing
the
weakest
in
the
center
and
rush
in
a
body
to
their
death
with
the
faint
chance
of
being
able
to
fight
their
way
through
the
enemy
the
spaniards
received
a
hint
of
this
and
believing
that
there
was
nothing
the
dutch
would
not
dare
to
do
they
concluded
to
offer
high
time
i
should
yes
with
falsehood
and
treachery
they
soon
obtained
an
entrance
into
the
city
promising
protection
and
forgiveness
to
all
except
those
whom
the
citizens
themselves
would
acknowledge
as
deserving
of
you
don
t
say
so
said
lambert
quite
interested
that
ended
the
business
i
not
a
bit
of
it
returned
en
for
the
duke
of
alva
had
already
given
his
son
orders
to
show
mercy
to
ah
that
was
where
the
great
haarlem
massacre
came
in
i
remember
now
you
can
t
wonder
that
the
hollanders
dislike
spain
when
you
read
of
the
way
they
were
butchered
by
alva
and
his
hosts
though
i
admit
that
our
side
sometimes
retaliated
terribly
but
as
i
have
told
you
before
i
have
a
very
indistinct
idea
of
historical
matters
everything
is
confusion
from
the
flood
to
the
battle
of
waterloo
one
thing
is
plain
however
the
duke
of
alva
was
about
the
worst
specimen
of
a
man
that
ever
that
gives
only
a
faint
idea
of
him
said
ben
but
i
hate
to
think
of
such
a
wretch
what
if
he
had
brains
and
military
skill
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
give
me
such
men
as
van
der
werf
and
what
now
why
said
van
mounen
who
was
looking
up
and
down
the
street
in
a
bewildered
way
we
ve
walked
right
past
the
museum
and
i
don
t
see
the
boys
let
us
go
leyden
the
boys
met
at
the
museum
and
were
soon
engaged
in
examining
its
extensive
collection
of
curiosities
receiving
a
new
insight
into
egyptian
life
ancient
and
modern
ben
and
lambert
had
often
visited
the
british
museum
but
that
did
not
prevent
them
from
being
surprised
at
the
richness
of
the
leyden
collection
there
were
household
utensils
wearing
apparel
weapons
musical
instruments
sarcophagi
and
mummies
of
men
women
and
cats
ibexes
and
other
creatures
they
saw
a
massive
gold
armlet
that
had
been
worn
by
an
egyptian
king
at
a
time
when
some
of
these
same
mummies
perhaps
were
nimbly
treading
the
streets
of
thebes
and
jewels
and
trinkets
such
as
pharaoh
s
daughter
wore
and
the
children
of
israel
borrowed
when
they
departed
out
of
egypt
there
were
other
interesting
relics
from
rome
and
greece
and
some
curious
roman
pottery
which
had
been
discovered
in
digging
near
the
hague
relics
of
the
days
when
the
countrymen
of
julius
caesar
had
settled
there
where
have
they
not
settled
i
for
one
would
hardly
be
astonished
if
relics
of
the
ancient
romans
should
someday
be
found
deep
under
the
grass
growing
around
the
bunker
hill
monument
when
the
boys
left
this
museum
they
went
to
another
and
saw
a
wonderful
collection
of
fossil
animals
skeletons
birds
minerals
precious
stones
and
other
natural
specimens
but
as
they
were
not
learned
men
they
could
only
walk
about
and
stare
enjoy
the
little
knowledge
of
natural
history
they
possessed
and
wish
with
all
their
hearts
they
had
acquired
more
even
the
skeleton
of
the
mouse
puzzled
jacob
what
wonder
he
was
not
used
to
seeing
the
little
creatures
running
about
in
their
bones
and
how
could
he
ever
have
imagined
their
necks
to
be
so
queer
besides
the
museum
of
natural
history
there
was
saint
peter
s
church
to
be
visited
containing
professor
luzac
s
memorial
and
boerhaave
s
monument
of
white
and
black
marble
with
its
urn
and
carved
symbols
of
the
four
ages
of
life
and
its
medallion
of
boerhaave
adorned
with
his
favorite
motto
simplex
sigillum
veri
they
also
obtained
admittance
to
a
tea
garden
which
in
summer
was
a
favorite
resort
of
the
citizens
and
passing
naked
oaks
and
fruit
trees
ascended
to
a
high
mound
which
stood
in
the
center
this
was
the
site
of
a
round
tower
now
in
ruins
said
by
some
to
have
been
built
by
hengist
the
king
and
by
others
to
have
been
the
castle
of
one
of
the
ancient
counts
of
holland
as
the
boys
walked
about
on
the
top
of
its
stone
wall
they
could
get
but
a
poor
view
of
the
surrounding
city
the
tower
stood
higher
when
more
than
two
centuries
ago
the
inhabitants
of
beleaguered
leyden
shouted
to
the
watcher
on
its
top
their
wild
despairing
cries
is
there
any
help
are
the
waters
rising
what
do
you
see
and
for
months
he
could
only
answer
no
help
i
see
around
us
nothing
but
the
ben
pushed
these
thoughts
away
and
resolutely
looking
down
into
the
bare
tea
garden
filled
it
in
imagination
with
gay
summer
groups
he
tried
to
forget
old
battle
clouds
and
picture
only
curling
wreaths
of
tobacco
smoke
rising
from
among
men
women
and
children
enjoying
their
tea
and
coffee
in
the
open
air
but
a
tragedy
came
in
spite
of
him
poot
was
bending
over
the
edge
of
the
high
wall
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
grow
dizzy
and
tumble
off
ben
turned
impatiently
away
if
the
fellow
with
his
weak
head
knew
no
better
than
to
be
venturesome
why
let
him
tumble
horror
what
mean
that
heavy
crashing
sound
ben
could
not
stir
he
could
only
gasp
jacob
jacob
cried
another
startled
voice
and
another
ready
to
faint
ben
managed
to
turn
his
head
he
saw
a
crowd
of
boys
on
the
edge
of
the
wall
opposite
but
jacob
was
not
there
good
heavens
he
cried
springing
forward
where
is
my
cousin
the
crowd
parted
it
was
only
four
boys
after
all
there
sat
jacob
in
their
midst
holding
his
sides
and
laughing
heartily
did
i
frighten
you
all
he
said
in
his
native
dutch
well
i
will
tell
you
how
it
was
there
was
a
big
stone
lying
on
the
wall
and
i
put
my
my
foot
out
just
to
push
it
a
little
you
see
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
down
went
the
stone
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
and
left
me
sitting
here
on
top
with
both
my
feet
in
the
air
if
i
had
not
thrown
myself
back
at
that
moment
i
certainly
should
have
rolled
over
after
the
stone
well
it
is
no
matter
help
me
up
you
re
hurt
said
ben
seeing
a
shade
of
seriousness
pass
over
his
cousin
s
face
as
they
lifted
him
to
his
feet
jacob
tried
to
laugh
again
oh
no
i
feels
a
little
hurt
ven
i
stant
up
but
it
ish
no
the
monument
to
van
der
werf
in
the
hooglandsche
kerk
was
not
accessible
that
day
but
the
boys
spent
a
few
pleasant
moments
in
the
stadhuis
or
town
hall
a
long
irregular
structure
somewhat
in
the
gothic
style
uncouth
in
architecture
but
picturesque
from
age
its
little
steeple
tuneful
with
bells
seemed
to
have
been
borrowed
from
some
other
building
and
hastily
clapped
on
as
a
finishing
touch
ascending
the
grand
staircase
the
boys
soon
found
themselves
in
a
rather
gloomy
apartment
containing
the
masterpiece
of
lucas
van
leyden
or
hugens
a
dutch
artist
born
three
hundred
and
seventy
years
ago
who
painted
well
when
he
was
ten
years
of
age
and
became
distinguished
in
art
when
only
fifteen
this
picture
called
the
last
judgment
considering
the
remote
age
in
which
it
was
painted
is
truly
a
remarkable
production
the
boys
however
were
less
interested
in
tracing
out
the
merits
of
the
work
than
they
were
in
the
fact
of
its
being
a
triptych
that
is
painted
on
three
divisions
the
two
outer
ones
swung
on
hinges
so
as
to
close
when
required
over
the
main
portion
the
historical
pictures
of
harel
de
moor
and
other
famous
dutch
artists
interested
them
for
a
while
and
ben
had
to
be
almost
pulled
away
from
the
dingy
old
portrait
of
van
der
werf
the
town
hall
as
well
as
the
egyptian
museum
is
on
the
breedstraat
the
longest
and
finest
street
in
leyden
it
has
no
canal
running
through
it
and
the
houses
painted
in
every
variety
of
color
have
a
picturesque
effect
as
they
stand
with
their
gable
ends
to
the
street
some
are
very
tall
with
half
their
height
in
their
roofs
others
crouch
before
the
public
edifices
and
churches
being
clean
spacious
and
adorned
with
many
elegant
mansions
it
compares
favorably
with
the
finery
portions
of
amsterdam
it
is
kept
scrupulously
neat
many
of
the
gutters
are
covered
with
boards
that
open
like
trapdoors
and
it
is
supplied
with
pumps
surmounted
with
shining
brass
ornaments
kept
scoured
and
bright
at
the
public
cost
the
city
is
intersected
by
numerous
water
roads
formed
by
the
river
rhine
there
grown
sluggish
fatigued
by
its
long
travel
but
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
stone
bridges
reunite
the
dissevered
streets
the
same
river
degraded
from
the
beautiful
rhine
serves
as
a
moat
from
the
rampart
that
surrounds
leyden
and
is
crossed
by
drawbridges
at
the
imposing
gateways
that
give
access
to
the
city
fine
broad
promenades
shaded
by
noble
trees
border
the
canals
and
add
to
the
retired
appearance
of
the
houses
behind
heightening
the
effect
of
scholastic
seclusion
that
seems
to
pervade
the
place
ben
as
he
scanned
the
buildings
on
the
rapenburg
canal
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
appearance
of
the
great
university
of
leyden
but
when
he
recalled
its
history
how
attended
with
all
the
pomp
of
a
grand
civic
display
it
had
been
founded
by
the
prince
of
orange
as
a
tribute
to
the
citizens
for
the
bravery
displayed
during
the
siege
when
he
remembered
the
great
men
in
religion
learning
and
science
who
had
once
studied
there
and
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
students
now
sharing
the
benefits
of
its
classes
and
its
valuable
scientific
museums
he
was
quite
willing
to
forego
architectural
beauty
though
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
no
amount
of
it
could
have
been
misplaced
on
such
an
institution
peter
and
jacob
regarded
the
building
with
an
even
deeper
more
practical
interest
for
they
were
to
enter
it
as
students
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
poor
don
quixote
would
have
run
a
hopeless
tilt
in
this
part
of
the
world
said
ben
after
lambert
had
been
pointing
out
some
of
the
oddities
and
beauties
of
the
suburbs
it
is
all
windmills
you
remember
his
terrific
contest
with
one
i
no
said
lambert
bluntly
well
i
don
t
either
that
is
not
definitely
but
there
was
something
of
that
kind
in
his
adventures
and
if
there
wasn
t
there
should
have
been
look
at
them
how
frantically
they
whirl
their
great
arms
just
the
thing
to
excite
the
crazy
knight
to
mortal
combat
it
bewilders
one
to
look
at
them
help
me
to
count
all
those
we
can
see
van
mounen
i
want
a
big
item
for
my
and
after
a
careful
reckoning
superintended
by
all
the
party
master
ben
wrote
in
pencil
saw
windmills
within
full
view
of
he
would
have
been
glad
to
visit
the
old
brick
mill
in
which
the
painter
rembrandt
was
born
but
he
abandoned
the
project
upon
learning
that
it
would
take
them
out
of
their
way
few
boys
as
hungry
as
ben
was
by
this
time
would
hesitate
long
between
rembrandt
s
home
a
mile
off
and
tiffin
close
by
ben
chose
the
latter
after
tiffin
they
rested
awhile
and
then
took
another
which
for
form
s
sake
they
called
dinner
after
dinner
the
boys
sat
warming
themselves
at
the
inn
all
but
peter
who
occupied
the
time
in
another
fruitless
search
for
boekman
this
over
the
party
once
more
prepared
for
skating
they
were
thirteen
miles
from
the
hague
and
not
as
fresh
as
when
they
had
left
broek
early
on
the
previous
day
but
they
were
in
good
spirits
and
the
ice
was
excellent
the
palace
in
the
wood
as
the
boys
skated
onward
they
saw
a
number
of
fine
country
seats
all
decorated
and
surrounded
according
to
the
dutchest
of
dutch
taste
but
impressive
to
look
upon
with
their
great
formal
houses
elaborate
gardens
square
hedges
and
wide
ditches
some
crossed
by
a
bridge
having
a
gate
in
the
middle
to
be
carefully
locked
at
night
these
ditches
everywhere
traversing
the
landscape
had
long
ago
lost
their
summer
film
and
now
shone
under
the
sunlight
like
trailing
ribbons
of
glass
the
boys
traveled
bravely
all
the
while
performing
the
surprising
feat
of
producing
gingerbread
from
their
pockets
and
causing
it
to
vanish
instantly
twelve
miles
were
passed
a
few
more
long
strokes
would
take
them
to
the
hague
when
van
mounen
proposed
that
they
should
vary
their
course
by
walking
into
the
city
through
the
bosch
agreed
cried
one
and
all
and
their
skates
were
off
in
a
twinkling
the
bosch
is
a
grand
park
or
wood
nearly
two
miles
long
containing
the
celebrated
house
in
the
wood
huis
in
t
bosch
sometimes
used
as
a
royal
residence
the
building
though
plain
outside
for
a
palace
is
elegantly
furnished
within
and
finely
frescoed
that
is
the
walls
and
ceiling
are
covered
with
groups
and
designs
painted
directly
upon
them
while
the
plaster
was
fresh
some
of
the
rooms
are
tapestried
with
chinese
silks
beautifully
embroidered
one
contains
a
number
of
family
portraits
among
them
a
group
of
royal
children
who
in
time
were
orphaned
by
a
certain
ax
which
figures
very
frequently
in
european
history
these
children
were
painted
many
times
by
the
dutch
artist
van
dyck
who
was
court
painter
to
their
father
charles
the
first
of
england
beautiful
children
they
were
what
a
deal
of
trouble
the
english
nation
would
have
been
spared
had
they
been
as
perfect
in
heart
and
soul
as
they
were
in
form
the
park
surrounding
the
palace
is
charming
especially
in
summer
for
flowers
and
birds
make
it
bright
as
fairyland
long
rows
of
magnificent
oaks
rear
their
proud
heads
conscious
that
no
profaning
hand
will
ever
bring
them
low
in
fact
the
wood
has
for
ages
been
held
as
an
almost
sacred
spot
children
are
never
allowed
to
meddle
with
its
smallest
twig
the
ax
of
the
woodman
has
never
resounded
there
even
war
and
riot
have
passed
it
reverently
pausing
for
a
moment
in
their
devastating
way
philip
of
spain
while
he
ordered
dutchmen
to
be
mowed
down
by
hundreds
issued
a
mandate
that
not
a
bough
of
the
beautiful
wood
should
be
touched
and
once
when
in
a
time
of
great
necessity
the
state
was
about
to
sacrifice
it
to
assist
in
filling
a
nearly
exhausted
treasury
the
people
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
nobly
contributed
the
required
amount
rather
than
that
the
bosch
should
fall
what
wonder
then
that
the
oaks
have
a
grand
fearless
air
birds
from
all
holland
have
told
them
how
elsewhere
trees
are
cropped
and
bobbed
into
shape
but
they
are
untouched
year
after
year
they
expand
in
unclipped
luxuriance
and
beauty
their
foliage
alive
with
song
casts
a
cool
shade
over
lawn
and
pathway
or
bows
to
its
image
in
the
sunny
ponds
meanwhile
as
if
to
reward
the
citizens
for
allowing
her
to
have
her
way
for
once
nature
departs
from
the
invariable
level
wearing
gracefully
the
ornaments
that
have
been
reverently
bestowed
upon
her
so
the
lawn
slopes
in
a
velvety
green
the
paths
wind
in
and
out
flower
beds
glow
and
send
forth
perfume
and
ponds
and
sky
look
at
each
other
in
mutual
admiration
even
on
that
winter
day
the
bosch
was
beautiful
its
trees
were
bare
but
beneath
them
still
lay
the
ponds
every
ripple
smoothed
into
glass
the
blue
sky
was
bright
overhead
and
as
it
looked
down
through
the
thicket
of
boughs
it
saw
another
blue
sky
not
nearly
so
bright
looking
up
from
the
dim
thicket
under
the
ice
never
had
the
sunset
appeared
more
beautiful
to
peter
than
when
he
saw
it
exchanging
farewell
glances
with
the
windows
and
shining
roofs
of
the
city
before
him
never
had
the
hague
itself
seemed
more
inviting
he
was
no
longer
peter
van
holp
going
to
visit
a
great
city
nor
a
fine
young
gentleman
bent
on
he
was
a
knight
an
adventurer
and
weary
a
grown
large
a
fortunatas
approaching
the
enchanted
castle
where
luxury
and
ease
awaited
him
for
his
own
sister
s
house
was
not
half
a
mile
away
at
last
boys
he
cried
in
high
glee
we
may
hope
for
a
royal
resting
place
good
beds
warm
rooms
and
something
fit
to
eat
i
never
realized
before
what
a
luxury
such
things
are
our
lodgings
at
the
red
lion
have
made
us
appreciate
our
own
the
merchant
prince
and
the
well
might
peter
feel
that
his
sister
s
house
was
like
an
enchanted
castle
large
and
elegant
as
it
was
a
spell
of
quiet
hung
over
it
the
very
lion
crouching
at
its
gate
seemed
to
have
been
turned
into
stone
through
magic
within
it
was
guarded
by
genii
in
the
shape
of
servants
who
sprang
silently
forth
at
the
summons
of
bell
or
knocker
there
was
a
cat
also
who
appeared
as
knowing
as
any
and
a
brass
gnome
in
the
hall
whose
business
it
was
to
stand
with
outstretched
arms
ready
to
receive
sticks
and
umbrellas
safe
within
the
walls
bloomed
a
garden
of
delight
where
the
flowers
firmly
believed
it
was
summer
and
a
sparkling
fountain
was
laughing
merrily
to
itself
because
jack
frost
could
not
find
it
there
was
a
sleeping
beauty
too
just
at
the
time
of
the
boys
arrival
but
when
peter
like
a
true
prince
flew
lightly
up
the
stairs
and
kissed
her
eyelids
the
enchantment
was
broken
the
princess
became
his
own
good
sister
and
the
fairy
castle
just
one
of
the
finest
most
comfortable
houses
of
the
hague
as
may
well
be
believed
the
boys
received
the
heartiest
of
welcomes
after
they
had
conversed
awhile
with
their
lively
hostess
one
of
the
genii
summoned
them
to
a
grand
repast
in
a
room
where
floor
and
ceiling
shone
like
polished
ivory
and
the
mirrors
suddenly
blossomed
into
boys
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
they
had
caviar
now
and
salmagundi
and
sausage
and
cheese
besides
salad
and
fruit
and
biscuit
and
cake
how
the
boys
could
partake
of
such
a
medley
was
a
mystery
to
ben
for
the
salad
was
sour
and
the
cake
was
sweet
the
fruit
was
dainty
and
the
salmagundi
heavy
with
onions
and
fish
but
while
he
was
wondering
he
made
a
hearty
meal
and
was
soon
absorbed
in
deciding
which
he
really
preferred
the
coffee
or
the
anisette
cordial
it
was
delightful
too
this
taking
one
s
food
from
dishes
of
frosted
silver
and
liqueur
glasses
from
which
titania
herself
might
have
sipped
the
young
gentleman
afterward
wrote
to
his
mother
that
pretty
and
choice
as
things
were
at
home
he
had
never
known
what
cut
glass
china
and
silver
services
were
until
he
visited
the
hague
of
course
peter
s
sister
soon
heard
all
of
the
boys
adventures
how
they
had
skated
over
forty
miles
and
seen
rare
sights
on
the
way
how
they
had
lost
their
purse
and
found
it
again
how
one
of
the
party
had
fallen
and
given
them
an
excuse
for
a
grand
sail
in
an
ice
boat
how
above
all
they
had
caught
a
robber
and
so
for
a
second
time
saved
their
slippery
purse
and
now
peter
said
the
lady
when
the
story
was
finished
you
must
write
at
once
to
tell
the
good
people
of
broek
that
your
adventures
have
reached
their
height
that
you
and
your
fellow
travelers
have
all
been
taken
the
boys
looked
startled
indeed
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
laughed
peter
we
must
leave
tomorrow
at
but
the
sister
had
already
decided
differently
and
a
holland
lady
is
not
to
be
easily
turned
from
her
purpose
in
short
she
held
forth
such
strong
temptations
and
was
so
bright
and
cheerful
and
said
so
many
coaxing
and
unanswerable
things
both
in
english
and
dutch
that
the
boys
were
all
delighted
when
it
was
settled
that
they
should
remain
at
the
hague
for
at
least
two
days
next
the
grand
skating
race
was
talked
over
mevrouw
van
gend
gladly
promised
to
be
present
on
the
occasion
i
shall
witness
your
triumph
peter
she
said
for
you
are
the
fastest
skater
i
ever
peter
blushed
and
gave
a
slight
cough
as
carl
answered
for
him
ah
mevrouw
he
is
swift
but
all
the
broek
boys
are
fine
skaters
even
the
rag
pickers
and
he
thought
bitterly
of
poor
hans
the
lady
laughed
that
will
make
the
race
all
the
more
exciting
she
said
but
i
shall
wish
each
of
you
to
be
the
at
this
moment
her
husband
mynheer
van
gend
came
in
and
the
enchantment
falling
upon
the
boys
was
complete
the
invisible
fairies
of
the
household
at
once
clustered
about
them
whispering
that
jasper
van
gend
had
a
heart
as
young
and
fresh
as
their
own
and
if
he
loved
anything
in
this
world
more
than
industry
it
was
sunshine
and
frolic
they
hinted
also
something
about
his
having
a
hearty
full
of
love
and
a
head
full
of
wisdom
and
finally
gave
the
boys
to
understand
that
when
mynheer
said
a
thing
he
meant
it
therefore
his
frank
well
now
this
is
pleasant
as
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
made
the
boys
feel
quite
at
home
and
as
happy
as
squirrels
there
were
fine
paintings
in
the
drawing
room
and
exquisite
statuary
and
portfolios
filled
with
rare
dutch
engravings
besides
many
beautiful
and
curious
things
from
china
and
japan
the
boys
felt
that
it
would
require
a
month
to
examine
all
the
treasures
of
the
apartment
ben
noticed
with
pleasure
english
books
lying
upon
the
table
he
saw
also
over
the
carved
upright
piano
portraits
of
william
of
orange
and
his
english
queen
a
sight
that
for
a
time
brought
england
and
holland
side
by
side
in
his
heart
william
and
mary
have
left
a
halo
round
the
english
throne
to
this
day
he
the
truest
patriot
that
ever
served
an
adopted
country
she
the
noblest
wife
that
ever
sat
upon
a
british
throne
up
to
the
time
of
victoria
and
albert
the
good
as
ben
looked
at
the
pictures
he
remembered
accounts
he
had
read
of
king
william
s
visit
to
the
hague
in
the
winter
of
he
who
sang
the
battle
of
ivry
had
not
yet
told
the
glowing
story
of
that
day
but
ben
knew
enough
of
it
to
fancy
that
he
could
almost
hear
the
shouts
of
the
delighted
populace
as
he
looked
from
the
portraits
to
the
street
which
at
this
moment
was
aglow
with
a
bonfire
kindled
in
a
neighboring
square
that
royal
visit
was
one
never
to
be
forgotten
for
two
years
william
of
orange
had
been
monarch
of
a
foreign
land
his
head
working
faithfully
for
england
but
his
whole
heart
yearning
for
holland
now
when
he
sought
its
shores
once
more
the
entire
nation
bade
him
welcome
multitudes
flocked
to
the
hague
to
meet
him
many
thousands
came
sliding
or
skating
along
the
frozen
canals
from
amsterdam
rotterdam
leyden
haarlem
macaulay
s
history
of
england
all
day
long
the
festivities
of
the
capital
were
kept
up
the
streets
were
gorgeous
with
banners
evergreen
arches
trophies
and
mottoes
of
welcome
and
emblems
of
industry
william
saw
the
deeds
of
his
ancestors
and
scenes
of
his
own
past
life
depicted
on
banners
and
tapestries
along
the
streets
at
night
superb
fireworks
were
displayed
upon
the
ice
its
glassy
surface
was
like
a
mirror
sparkling
fountains
of
light
sprang
up
from
below
to
meet
the
glittering
cascades
leaping
upon
it
then
a
feathery
fire
of
crimson
and
green
shook
millions
of
rubies
and
emeralds
into
the
ruddy
depths
of
the
ice
and
all
this
time
the
people
were
shouting
god
bless
william
of
orange
long
live
the
king
they
were
half
mad
with
joy
and
enthusiasm
william
their
own
prince
their
stadtholder
had
become
the
ruler
of
three
kingdoms
he
had
been
victorious
in
council
and
in
war
and
now
in
his
hour
of
greatest
triumph
had
come
as
a
simple
guest
to
visit
them
the
king
heard
their
shouts
with
a
beating
heart
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
beloved
by
one
s
country
his
english
courtiers
complimented
him
upon
his
reception
yes
said
he
but
the
shouting
is
nothing
to
what
it
would
have
been
if
mary
had
been
with
me
while
ben
was
looking
at
the
portraits
mynheer
van
gend
was
giving
the
boys
an
account
of
a
recent
visit
to
antwerp
as
it
was
the
birthplace
of
quentin
matsys
the
blacksmith
who
for
love
of
an
artist
s
daughter
studied
until
he
became
a
great
painter
the
boys
asked
their
host
if
he
had
seen
any
of
matsys
works
yes
indeed
he
replied
and
excellent
they
are
his
famous
triptych
in
a
chapel
of
the
antwerp
cathedral
with
the
descent
from
the
cross
on
the
center
panel
is
especially
fine
but
i
confess
i
was
more
interested
in
his
what
well
mynheer
asked
ludwig
one
in
the
heart
of
the
city
near
this
same
cathedral
whose
lofty
steeple
is
of
such
delicate
workmanship
that
the
french
emperor
said
it
reminded
him
of
mechlin
lace
the
well
is
covered
with
a
gothic
canopy
surmounted
by
the
figure
of
a
knight
in
full
armor
it
is
all
of
metal
and
proves
that
matsys
was
an
artist
at
the
forge
as
well
as
at
the
easel
indeed
his
great
fame
is
mainly
derived
from
his
miraculous
skill
as
an
artificer
in
next
mynheer
showed
the
boys
some
exquisite
berlin
castings
which
he
had
purchased
in
antwerp
they
were
iron
jewelry
and
very
delicate
beautiful
medallions
designed
from
rare
paintings
bordered
with
fine
tracery
and
open
work
worthy
he
said
of
being
worn
by
the
fairest
lady
of
the
land
consequently
the
necklace
was
handed
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
to
the
blushing
mevrouw
van
gend
something
in
the
lady
s
aspect
as
she
bent
her
bright
young
face
over
the
gift
caused
mynheer
to
say
earnestly
i
can
read
your
thoughts
she
looked
up
in
playful
defiance
ah
now
i
am
sure
of
them
you
were
thinking
of
those
noblehearted
women
but
for
whom
prussia
might
have
fallen
i
know
it
by
that
proud
light
in
your
the
proud
light
in
my
eye
plays
me
false
then
she
answered
i
had
no
such
grand
matter
in
my
mind
to
confess
the
simple
truth
i
was
only
thinking
how
lovely
this
necklace
would
be
with
my
blue
so
so
exclaimed
the
rather
crestfallen
spouse
but
i
can
think
of
the
other
jasper
and
it
will
add
a
deeper
value
to
your
gift
you
remember
the
incident
do
you
not
peter
how
when
the
french
were
invading
prussia
and
for
lack
of
means
the
country
was
unable
to
defend
itself
against
the
enemy
the
women
turned
the
scale
by
pouring
their
plate
and
jewels
into
the
public
treasury
aha
thought
mynheer
as
he
met
his
vrouw
s
kindling
glance
the
proud
light
is
there
now
in
earnest
peter
remarked
maliciously
that
the
women
had
still
proved
true
to
their
vanity
on
that
occasion
for
jewelry
they
would
have
if
gold
or
silver
were
wanted
by
the
kingdom
they
would
relinquish
it
and
use
iron
but
they
could
not
do
without
their
ornaments
what
of
that
said
the
vrouw
kindling
again
it
is
no
sin
to
love
beautiful
things
if
you
adapt
your
material
to
circumstances
all
i
have
to
say
is
the
women
saved
their
country
and
indirectly
introduced
a
very
important
branch
of
manufacture
is
not
that
so
jasper
of
course
it
is
sweetheart
said
mynheer
but
peter
needs
no
word
of
mine
to
convince
him
that
all
the
world
over
women
have
never
been
found
wanting
in
their
country
s
hour
of
trial
though
bowing
to
mevrouw
his
own
country
women
stand
foremost
in
the
records
of
female
patriotism
and
then
turning
to
ben
the
host
talked
with
him
in
english
of
the
fine
old
belgian
city
among
other
things
he
told
the
origin
of
its
name
ben
had
been
taught
that
antwerp
was
derived
from
ae
nt
werf
on
the
wharf
but
mynheer
van
gend
gave
him
a
far
more
interesting
derivation
it
appears
that
about
three
thousand
years
ago
a
great
giant
named
antigonus
lived
on
the
river
scheld
on
the
site
of
the
present
city
of
antwerp
this
giant
claimed
half
the
merchandise
of
all
navigators
who
passed
his
castle
of
course
some
were
inclined
to
oppose
this
simple
regulation
in
such
cases
antigonus
by
way
of
teaching
them
to
practice
better
manners
next
time
cut
off
and
threw
into
the
river
the
rights
hands
of
the
merchants
thus
handwerpen
or
changed
to
antwerp
came
to
be
the
name
of
the
place
the
escutcheon
or
arms
of
the
city
has
two
hands
upon
it
what
better
proof
than
this
could
one
have
of
the
truth
of
the
story
especially
when
one
wishes
to
believe
it
when
mynheer
van
gend
had
related
in
two
languages
this
story
of
antwerp
he
was
tempted
to
tell
other
legends
some
in
english
some
in
dutch
and
so
the
moments
borne
upon
the
swift
shoulders
of
gnomes
and
giants
glided
rapidly
away
toward
bedtime
it
was
hard
to
break
up
so
pleasant
a
party
but
the
van
gend
household
moved
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
there
was
no
lingering
at
the
threshold
when
the
cordial
good
night
was
spoken
even
while
our
boys
were
mounting
the
stairs
the
invisible
household
fairies
again
clustered
around
them
whispering
that
system
and
regularity
had
been
chief
builders
of
the
master
s
prosperity
beautiful
chambers
with
three
beds
in
them
were
not
to
be
found
in
this
mansion
some
of
the
rooms
contained
two
but
each
visitor
slept
alone
before
morning
the
motto
of
the
party
evidently
was
every
boy
his
own
chrysalis
and
peter
at
least
was
not
sorry
to
have
it
so
tired
as
he
was
ben
after
noting
a
curious
bell
rope
in
the
corner
began
to
examine
his
bedclothes
each
article
filled
him
with
astonishment
the
exquisitely
fine
pillow
spread
trimmed
with
costly
lace
and
embroidered
with
a
gorgeous
crest
and
initial
the
dekbed
cover
a
great
silk
bag
large
as
the
bed
stuffed
with
swan
s
down
and
the
pink
satin
quilts
embroidered
with
garlands
of
flowers
he
could
scarcely
sleep
for
thinking
what
a
queer
little
bed
it
was
so
comfortable
and
pretty
too
with
all
its
queerness
in
the
morning
he
examined
the
top
coverlet
with
care
for
he
wished
to
send
home
a
description
of
it
in
his
next
letter
it
was
a
beautiful
japanese
spread
marvelous
in
texture
as
well
as
in
its
variety
of
brilliant
coloring
and
worth
as
ben
afterward
learned
not
less
than
three
hundred
dollars
the
floor
was
of
polished
wooden
mosaic
nearly
covered
with
a
rich
carpet
bordered
with
thick
black
fringe
another
room
displayed
a
margin
of
satinwood
around
the
carpet
hung
with
tapestry
its
walls
of
crimson
silk
were
topped
with
a
gilded
cornice
which
shot
down
gleams
of
light
far
into
the
polished
floor
over
the
doorway
of
the
room
in
which
jacob
and
ben
slept
was
a
bronze
stork
that
with
outstretched
neck
held
a
lamp
to
light
the
guests
into
the
apartment
between
the
two
narrow
beds
of
carved
whitewood
and
ebony
stood
the
household
treasure
of
the
van
gends
a
massive
oaken
chair
upon
which
the
prince
of
orange
had
once
sat
during
a
council
meeting
opposite
stood
a
quaintly
carved
clothespress
waxed
and
polished
to
the
utmost
and
filled
with
precious
stores
of
linen
beside
it
a
table
holding
a
large
bible
whose
great
golden
clasps
looked
poor
compared
with
its
solid
ribbed
binding
made
to
outlast
six
generations
there
was
a
ship
model
on
the
mantleshelf
and
over
it
hung
an
old
portrait
of
peter
the
great
who
you
know
once
gave
the
dockyard
cats
of
holland
a
fine
chance
to
look
at
a
king
which
is
one
of
the
special
prerogatives
of
cats
peter
though
czar
of
russia
was
not
too
proud
to
work
as
a
common
shipwright
in
the
dockyards
of
saardam
and
amsterdam
that
he
might
be
able
to
introduce
among
his
countrymen
dutch
improvements
in
ship
building
it
was
this
willingness
to
be
thorough
even
in
the
smallest
beginnings
that
earned
for
him
the
title
of
peter
the
great
peter
the
little
comparatively
speaking
was
up
first
the
next
morning
knowing
the
punctual
habits
of
his
he
took
good
care
that
none
of
the
boys
should
oversleep
themselves
a
hard
task
he
found
it
to
wake
jacob
poot
but
after
pulling
that
young
gentleman
out
of
bed
and
with
ben
s
help
dragging
him
about
the
room
for
a
while
he
succeeded
in
arousing
him
while
jacob
was
dressing
and
moaning
within
him
because
the
felt
slippers
provided
him
as
a
guest
were
too
tight
for
his
swollen
feet
peter
wrote
to
inform
their
friends
at
broek
of
the
safe
arrival
of
his
party
at
the
hague
he
also
begged
his
mother
to
send
word
to
hans
brinker
that
boekman
had
not
yet
reached
leyden
but
that
a
letter
containing
hans
s
message
had
been
left
at
the
hotel
where
the
doctor
always
lodged
during
his
visits
to
the
city
tell
him
also
wrote
peter
that
i
shall
call
there
again
as
i
pass
through
leyden
the
poor
boy
seemed
to
feel
sure
that
the
meester
would
hasten
to
save
his
father
but
we
who
know
the
gruff
old
gentleman
better
may
be
confident
he
will
do
no
such
thing
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
send
a
visiting
physician
from
amsterdam
to
the
cottage
at
once
if
jufvrouw
in
holland
women
of
the
lower
grades
of
society
do
not
take
the
title
of
or
mevrouw
when
they
marry
as
with
us
they
assume
their
husbands
names
but
are
still
called
miss
jufvrouw
pronounced
yuffrow
brinker
will
consent
to
receive
any
but
the
great
king
of
the
meesters
as
boekman
certainly
is
you
know
mother
added
peter
that
i
have
always
considered
sister
van
gend
s
house
as
rather
quiet
and
lonely
but
i
assure
you
it
is
not
so
now
he
says
we
make
him
wish
that
he
had
a
houseful
of
boys
of
his
own
he
has
promised
to
let
us
ride
on
his
noble
black
horses
they
are
gentle
as
kittens
he
says
if
one
have
but
a
firm
touch
at
the
rein
ben
according
to
jacob
s
account
is
a
glorious
rider
and
your
son
peter
is
not
a
very
bad
hand
at
the
business
so
we
two
are
to
go
out
together
this
morning
mounted
like
knights
of
old
after
we
return
brother
van
gend
says
he
will
lend
jacob
his
english
pony
and
obtain
three
extra
horses
and
all
of
the
party
are
to
trot
about
the
city
in
a
grand
cavalcade
led
on
by
him
he
will
ride
the
black
horse
which
father
sent
him
from
friesland
my
sister
s
pretty
roan
with
the
long
white
tail
is
lame
and
she
will
ride
none
other
else
she
would
accompany
us
i
could
scarcely
close
my
eyes
last
night
after
sister
told
me
of
the
plan
only
the
thought
of
poor
hans
brinker
and
his
sick
father
checked
me
but
for
that
i
could
have
sung
for
joy
ludwig
has
given
us
a
name
already
the
broek
cavalry
we
flatter
ourselves
that
we
shall
make
an
imposing
appearance
especially
in
single
file
the
broek
cavalry
were
not
disappointed
mynheer
van
gend
readily
procured
good
horses
and
all
the
boys
could
ride
though
none
was
as
perfect
horsemen
or
horseboys
as
peter
and
ben
they
saw
the
hague
to
their
hearts
content
and
the
hague
saw
them
expressing
its
approbation
loudly
through
the
mouths
of
small
boys
and
cart
dogs
silently
through
bright
eyes
that
not
looking
very
deeply
into
things
shone
as
they
looked
at
the
handsome
carl
and
twinkled
with
fun
as
a
certainly
portly
youth
with
shaking
cheeks
rode
past
bumpetty
bumpetty
bump
on
their
return
the
boys
pronounced
the
great
porcelain
stove
in
the
family
sitting
room
a
decidedly
useful
piece
of
furniture
for
they
could
gather
around
it
and
get
warm
without
burning
their
noses
or
bringing
on
chilblains
it
was
so
very
large
that
though
hot
elsewhere
it
seemed
to
send
out
warmth
by
the
houseful
its
pure
white
sides
and
polished
brass
rings
made
it
a
pretty
object
to
look
upon
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
our
ungrateful
ben
while
growing
thoroughly
warm
and
comfortable
beside
it
concocted
a
satirical
sentence
for
his
next
letter
to
the
effect
that
a
stove
in
holland
must
of
course
resemble
a
great
tower
of
snow
or
it
wouldn
t
be
in
keeping
with
the
oddity
of
the
country
to
describe
all
the
boys
saw
and
did
on
that
day
and
the
next
would
render
this
little
book
a
formidable
volume
indeed
they
visited
the
brass
cannon
foundry
saw
the
liquid
fire
poured
into
molds
and
watched
the
smiths
who
half
naked
stood
in
the
shadow
like
demons
playing
with
flame
they
admired
the
grand
public
buildings
and
massive
private
houses
the
elegant
streets
and
noble
bosch
pride
of
all
hollanders
the
palace
with
its
brilliant
mosaic
floors
its
frescoed
ceilings
and
gorgeous
ornaments
filled
ben
with
delight
he
was
surprised
that
some
of
the
churches
were
so
very
plain
elaborate
sometimes
in
external
architecture
but
bare
and
bleak
within
with
their
blank
whitewashed
walls
if
there
were
no
printed
record
the
churches
of
holland
would
almost
tell
her
story
i
will
not
enter
into
the
subject
here
except
to
say
that
ben
who
had
read
of
her
struggles
and
wrongs
and
of
the
terrible
retribution
she
had
from
time
to
time
dealt
forth
could
scarcely
tread
a
holland
town
without
mentally
leaping
over
the
bloody
of
its
history
he
could
not
forget
philip
of
spain
nor
the
duke
of
alva
even
while
rejoicing
in
the
prosperity
that
followed
the
liberation
he
looked
into
the
meekest
of
dutch
eyes
for
something
of
the
fire
that
once
lit
the
haggard
faces
of
those
desperate
lawless
men
who
wearing
with
pride
the
title
of
beggars
which
their
oppressors
had
mockingly
cast
upon
them
became
the
terror
of
land
and
sea
in
haarlem
he
had
wondered
that
the
air
did
not
still
resound
with
the
cries
of
alva
s
three
thousand
victims
in
leyden
his
heart
had
swelled
in
sympathy
as
he
thought
of
the
long
procession
of
scarred
and
famished
creatures
who
after
the
siege
with
adrian
van
der
werf
at
their
head
tottered
to
the
great
church
to
sing
a
glorious
anthem
because
leyden
was
free
he
remembered
that
this
was
even
before
they
had
tasted
the
bread
brought
by
the
dutch
ships
they
would
praise
god
first
then
eat
thousands
of
trembling
voices
were
raised
in
glad
thanksgiving
for
a
moment
it
swelled
higher
and
higher
then
suddenly
changed
to
sobbing
not
one
of
all
the
multitude
could
sing
another
note
but
who
shall
say
that
anthem
even
to
its
very
end
was
not
heard
in
heaven
here
in
the
hague
other
thoughts
came
to
ben
of
how
holland
in
later
years
unwillingly
put
her
head
under
the
french
yoke
and
how
galled
and
lashed
past
endurance
she
had
resolutely
jerked
it
out
again
he
liked
her
for
that
what
nation
of
any
spirit
thought
he
could
be
expected
to
stand
such
work
paying
all
her
wealth
into
a
foreign
treasury
and
yielding
up
the
flower
of
her
youth
under
foreign
conscription
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
either
since
english
guns
had
been
heard
booming
close
by
in
the
german
ocean
well
all
the
fighting
was
over
at
last
holland
was
a
snug
little
monarchy
now
in
her
own
right
and
ben
for
one
was
glad
of
it
arrived
at
this
charitable
conclusion
he
was
prepared
to
enjoy
to
the
utmost
all
the
wonders
of
her
capital
he
quite
delighted
mynheer
van
gend
with
his
hearty
and
intelligent
interest
so
in
fact
did
all
the
boys
for
a
merrier
more
observant
party
never
went
through
the
hague
the
picture
gallery
in
the
maurits
huis
a
building
erected
by
prince
maurice
of
nassau
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world
seemed
to
have
only
flashed
by
the
boys
during
a
visit
so
much
was
there
to
admire
and
examine
as
for
the
royal
cabinet
of
curiosities
in
the
same
building
they
felt
that
they
had
but
glanced
at
it
though
they
were
there
nearly
half
a
day
it
seemed
to
them
that
japan
had
poured
all
her
treasures
within
its
walls
for
a
long
period
holland
always
foremost
in
commerce
was
the
only
nation
allowed
to
have
any
intercourse
with
japan
one
can
well
forego
a
journey
to
that
country
if
he
can
but
visit
the
museum
at
the
hague
room
after
room
is
filled
with
collections
from
the
hermit
empire
costumes
peculiar
to
various
ranks
and
pursuits
articles
of
ornament
household
utensils
weapons
armor
and
surgical
instruments
there
is
also
an
ingenious
japanese
model
of
the
island
of
desina
the
dutch
factory
in
japan
it
appears
almost
as
the
island
itself
would
if
seen
through
a
reversed
opera
glass
and
makes
one
feel
like
a
gulliver
coming
unexpectedly
upon
a
japanese
lilliput
there
you
see
hundreds
of
people
in
native
costumes
standing
kneeling
stooping
reaching
all
at
work
or
pretending
to
be
and
their
dwellings
even
their
very
furniture
spread
out
before
you
plain
as
day
in
another
room
a
huge
tortoiseshell
dollhouse
fitted
up
in
dutch
style
and
inhabited
by
dignified
dutch
dolls
stands
ready
to
tell
you
at
a
glance
how
people
live
in
holland
gretel
hilda
katrinka
even
the
proud
rychie
korbes
would
have
been
delighted
with
this
but
peter
and
his
gallant
band
passed
it
by
without
a
glance
the
war
implements
had
the
honor
of
detaining
them
for
an
hour
such
clubs
such
murderous
krits
or
daggers
such
firearms
and
above
all
such
wonderful
japanese
swords
quite
capable
of
performing
the
accredited
japanese
feat
of
cutting
a
man
in
two
at
a
single
stroke
there
were
chinese
and
other
oriental
curiosities
in
the
collection
native
historical
relics
too
upon
which
our
young
dutchmen
gazed
very
soberly
though
they
were
secretly
proud
to
show
them
to
ben
there
was
a
model
of
the
cabin
at
saardam
in
which
peter
the
great
lived
during
his
short
career
as
also
wallets
and
bowls
once
carried
by
the
beggar
confederates
who
uniting
under
the
prince
of
orange
had
freed
holland
from
the
tyranny
of
spain
the
sword
of
admiral
van
speyk
who
about
ten
years
before
had
perished
in
voluntarily
blowing
up
his
own
ship
and
van
tromp
s
armor
with
the
marks
of
bullets
upon
it
jacob
looked
around
hoping
to
see
the
broom
which
the
plucky
admiral
fastened
to
his
masthead
but
it
was
not
there
the
waistcoat
which
william
third
william
prince
of
orange
who
became
king
of
england
was
a
of
william
the
silent
prince
of
orange
who
was
murdered
by
geraerts
or
gerard
july
of
england
wore
during
the
last
days
of
his
life
possessed
great
interest
for
ben
and
one
and
all
gazed
with
a
mixture
of
reverence
and
at
the
identical
clothing
worn
by
william
the
silent
see
above
when
he
was
murdered
at
delft
by
balthazar
geraerts
a
tawny
leather
doublet
and
plain
surcoat
of
gray
cloth
a
soft
felt
hat
and
a
high
from
which
hung
one
of
the
beggars
medals
these
were
not
in
themselves
very
princely
objects
though
the
doublet
had
a
tragic
interest
from
its
dark
stains
and
bullet
holes
ben
could
readily
believe
as
he
looked
upon
the
garments
that
the
silent
prince
true
to
his
greatness
of
character
had
been
exceedingly
simple
in
his
attire
his
aristocratic
prejudices
were
however
decidedly
shocked
when
lambert
told
him
of
the
way
in
which
william
s
bride
first
entered
the
hague
the
beautiful
louisa
de
coligny
whose
father
and
former
husband
both
had
fallen
at
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
was
coming
to
be
fourth
wife
to
the
prince
and
of
course
said
lambert
we
hollanders
were
too
gallant
to
allow
the
lady
to
enter
the
town
on
foot
no
sir
we
sent
or
rather
my
ancestors
did
a
clean
open
to
meet
her
with
a
plank
across
it
for
her
to
sit
upon
very
gallant
indeed
exclaimed
ben
with
almost
a
sneer
in
his
polite
laugh
and
she
the
daughter
of
an
admiral
of
was
she
upon
my
word
i
had
nearly
forgotten
that
but
you
see
holland
had
very
plain
ways
in
the
good
old
time
in
fact
we
are
a
very
simple
frugal
people
to
this
day
the
van
gend
establishment
is
a
decided
exception
you
a
very
agreeable
exception
i
think
said
ben
certainly
certainly
but
between
you
and
me
mynheer
van
gend
though
he
has
wrought
his
own
fortunes
can
afford
to
be
magnificent
and
yet
be
exactly
so
said
ben
profoundly
at
the
same
time
stroking
his
upper
lip
and
chin
which
latterly
he
believed
had
been
showing
delightful
and
unmistakable
signs
of
coming
dignities
while
tramping
on
foot
through
the
city
ben
often
longed
for
a
good
english
sidewalk
here
as
in
the
other
towns
there
was
no
curb
no
raised
pavement
for
foot
travelers
but
the
streets
were
clean
and
even
and
all
vehicles
were
kept
scrupulously
within
a
certain
tract
strange
to
say
there
were
nearly
as
many
sleds
as
wagons
to
be
seen
though
there
was
not
a
particle
of
snow
the
sleds
went
scraping
over
the
bricks
or
cobblestones
some
provided
with
an
apparatus
in
front
for
sprinkling
water
to
diminish
the
friction
and
some
rendered
less
musical
by
means
of
a
dripping
oil
rag
which
the
driver
occasionally
applied
to
the
runners
ben
was
surprised
at
the
noiseless
way
in
which
dutch
laborers
do
their
work
even
around
the
warehouses
and
docks
there
was
no
bustle
no
shouting
from
one
to
another
a
certain
twitch
of
the
pipe
or
turn
of
the
head
or
at
most
a
raising
of
the
hand
seemed
to
be
all
the
signal
necessary
entire
loads
of
cheeses
or
herrings
are
pitched
from
cart
or
canalboat
into
the
warehouses
without
a
word
but
the
passerby
must
take
his
chance
of
being
pelted
for
a
dutchman
seldom
looks
before
or
behind
him
while
engaged
at
work
poor
jacob
poot
who
seemed
destined
to
bear
all
the
mishaps
of
the
journey
was
knocked
nearly
breathless
by
a
great
cheese
which
a
fat
dutchman
was
throwing
to
a
fellow
laborer
but
he
recovered
himself
and
passed
on
without
evincing
the
least
indignation
ben
professed
great
sympathy
upon
the
occasion
but
jacob
insisted
that
it
was
then
why
did
you
screw
your
face
so
when
it
hit
you
what
for
screw
mine
face
repeated
jacob
soberly
vy
it
vash
de

that
what
insisted
ben
maliciously

laughed
oh

yesh

said
jacob
eagerly
it

ben
that

a
good
one

dutch
boy

cheese
you
can
never
make
me
believe
that
vell
it
ish
no
matter
replied
jacob
trudging
on
beside
ben
in
perfect
good
humor
vait
till
you
hit

soon
he
added
pathetically
penchamin
i
no

no

i
bees
a
just
as
ben
was
apologizing
lambert
hailed
him
hold
up
ben
here
is
the
fish
market
there
is
not
much
to
be
seen
at
this
season
but
we
can
take
a
look
at
the
storks
if
you
ben
knew
that
storks
were
held
in
peculiar
reverence
in
holland
and
that
the
bird
figured
upon
the
arms
of
the
capital
he
had
noticed
cart
wheels
placed
upon
the
roofs
of
dutch
cottages
to
entice
storks
to
settle
upon
them
he
had
seen
their
huge
nests
too
on
many
a
thatched
gable
roof
from
broek
to
the
hague
but
it
was
winter
now
the
nests
were
empty
no
greedy
birdlings
opened
their
mouths
or
rather
their
heads
at
the
approach
of
a
great
thing
with
outstretched
neck
and
legs
bearing
a
dangling
something
for
their
breakfast
the
were
far
away
picking
up
food
on
african
shores
and
before
they
would
return
in
the
spring
ben
s
visit
to
the
land
of
dikes
would
be
over
therefore
he
pressed
eagerly
forward
as
van
mounen
led
the
way
through
the
fish
market
anxious
to
see
if
storks
in
holland
were
anything
like
the
melancholy
specimens
he
had
seen
in
the
zoological
gardens
of
london
it
was
the
same
old
story
a
tamed
bird
is
a
sad
bird
say
what
you
will
these
storks
lived
in
a
sort
of
kennel
chained
by
the
feet
like
felons
though
supposed
to
be
honored
by
being
kept
at
the
public
expense
in
summer
they
were
allowed
to
walk
about
the
market
where
the
fish
stalls
were
like
so
many
free
dining
saloons
to
them
untasted
delicacies
in
the
form
of
raw
fish
and
butcher
s
offal
lay
about
their
kennels
now
but
the
city
guests
preferred
to
stand
upon
one
leg
curving
back
their
long
necks
and
leaning
their
heads
sidewise
in
a
blinking
reverie
how
gladly
they
would
have
changed
their
petted
state
for
the
busy
life
of
some
hardworking
stork
mother
or
father
bringing
up
a
troublesome
family
on
the
roof
of
a
rickety
old
building
where
flapping
frightened
them
half
to
death
every
time
they
ventured
forth
on
a
frolic
ben
soon
made
up
his
mind
and
rightly
too
that
the
hague
with
its
fine
streets
and
public
parks
shaded
with
elms
was
a
magnificent
city
the
prevailing
costume
was
like
that
of
london
or
paris
and
his
british
ears
were
many
a
time
cheered
by
the
music
of
british
words
the
shops
were
different
in
many
respects
from
those
on
oxford
street
and
the
strand
but
they
often
were
illumined
by
a
printed
announcement
that
english
was
spoken
others
proclaimed
themselves
to
have
london
stout
for
sale
and
one
actually
promised
to
regale
its
customers
with
english
roast
beef
over
every
possible
shop
door
was
the
placard
tabak
te
koop
tobacco
to
be
sold
instead
of
colored
glass
globes
in
the
windows
or
high
jars
of
leeches
the
drugstores
had
a
gaping
turk
s
head
at
the
entrance
or
if
the
establishment
was
particularly
fine
a
wooden
mandarin
entire
indulging
in
a
full
yawn
some
of
these
queer
faces
amused
ben
exceedingly
they
seemed
to
have
just
swallowed
a
dose
of
physic
but
van
mounen
declared
he
could
not
see
anything
funny
about
them
a
druggist
showed
his
sense
by
putting
a
gaper
before
his
door
so
that
his
place
would
be
known
at
once
as
an
apotheek
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
another
thing
attracted
ben
the
milkmen
s
carts
these
were
small
affairs
filled
with
shiny
brass
kettles
or
stone
jars
and
drawn
by
dogs
the
milkman
walked
meekly
beside
his
cart
keeping
his
dog
in
order
and
delivering
the
milk
to
customers
certain
fish
dealers
had
dogcarts
also
and
when
a
herring
dog
chanced
to
meet
a
milk
dog
he
invariably
put
on
airs
and
growled
as
he
passed
him
sometimes
a
milk
dog
would
recognize
an
acquaintance
before
another
milk
cart
across
the
street
and
then
how
the
kettles
would
rattle
especially
if
they
were
empty
each
dog
would
give
a
bound
and
never
caring
for
his
master
s
whistle
insist
upon
meeting
the
other
halfway
sometimes
they
contented
themselves
with
an
inquisitive
sniff
but
generally
the
smaller
dog
made
an
affectionate
snap
snap
at
the
larger
one
s
ear
or
a
friendly
tussle
was
engaged
in
by
way
of
exercise
then
woe
to
the
milk
kettles
and
woe
to
the
dogs
the
whipping
over
each
dog
expressing
his
feelings
as
best
as
he
could
would
trot
demurely
back
to
his
work
if
some
of
these
animals
were
eccentric
in
their
ways
others
were
remarkably
well
behaved
in
fact
there
was
a
school
for
dogs
in
the
city
established
expressly
for
training
them
ben
probably
saw
some
of
its
graduates
many
a
time
he
noticed
a
span
of
barkers
trotting
along
the
street
with
all
the
dignity
of
horses
obeying
the
slightest
hint
of
the
man
walking
briskly
beside
them
sometimes
when
their
load
was
delivered
the
dealer
would
jump
in
the
cart
and
have
a
fine
drive
to
his
home
beyond
the
gates
of
the
city
and
sometimes
i
regret
to
say
a
patient
vrouw
would
trudge
beside
the
cart
with
a
fish
basket
upon
her
head
and
a
child
in
her
arms
while
her
lord
enjoyed
his
drive
carrying
no
heavier
burden
than
a
stumpy
clay
pipe
the
smoke
of
which
mounted
lovingly
into
her
face
a
day
of
rest
the
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
so
did
our
boys
visit
to
the
hague
they
had
spent
three
happy
days
and
nights
with
the
van
gends
and
strange
to
say
had
not
once
in
all
that
time
put
on
skates
the
third
day
had
indeed
been
one
of
rest
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
city
was
hushed
sweet
sunday
bells
sent
blessed
tranquil
thoughts
into
their
hearts
ben
felt
as
he
listened
to
their
familiar
music
that
the
christian
world
is
one
after
all
however
divided
by
sects
and
differences
it
may
be
as
the
clock
speaks
everyone
s
native
language
in
whatever
land
it
may
strike
the
hour
so
church
bells
are
never
foreign
if
our
hearts
but
listen
led
on
by
these
clear
voices
our
party
with
mevrouw
van
gend
and
her
husband
trod
the
quiet
but
crowded
streets
until
they
came
to
a
fine
old
church
in
the
southern
part
of
the
city
the
interior
was
large
and
notwithstanding
its
great
stained
windows
seemed
dimly
lighted
though
the
walls
were
white
and
dashes
of
red
and
purple
sunshine
lay
brightly
upon
pillar
and
pew
ben
saw
a
few
old
women
moving
softly
through
the
aisles
each
bearing
a
high
pile
of
foot
stoves
which
she
distributed
among
the
congregation
by
skillfully
slipping
out
the
under
one
until
none
were
left
it
puzzled
him
that
mynheer
should
settle
himself
with
the
boys
in
a
comfortable
side
pew
after
seating
his
vrouw
in
the
body
of
the
church
which
was
filled
with
chairs
exclusively
appropriated
to
the
women
but
ben
was
learning
only
a
common
custom
of
the
country
the
pews
of
the
nobility
and
the
dignitaries
of
the
city
were
circular
in
form
each
surrounding
a
column
elaborately
carved
they
formed
a
massive
base
to
their
great
pillars
standing
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
blank
white
walls
beyond
these
columns
lofty
and
well
proportioned
were
nicked
and
defaced
from
violence
done
to
them
long
ago
yet
it
seemed
quite
fitting
that
before
they
were
lost
in
the
deep
arches
overhead
their
softened
outlines
should
leaf
out
as
they
did
into
richness
and
beauty
soon
ben
lowered
his
gaze
to
the
marble
floor
it
was
a
pavement
of
gravestones
nearly
all
the
large
slabs
of
which
it
was
composed
marked
the
resting
places
of
the
dead
an
armorial
design
engraved
upon
each
stone
with
inscription
and
date
told
whose
form
as
sleeping
beneath
and
sometimes
three
of
a
family
were
lying
one
above
the
other
in
the
same
sepulcher
he
could
not
help
but
think
of
the
solemn
funeral
procession
winding
by
torchlight
through
those
lofty
aisles
and
bearing
its
silent
burden
toward
a
dark
opening
whence
the
slab
had
been
lifted
in
readiness
for
its
coming
it
was
something
to
think
that
his
sister
mabel
who
died
in
her
flower
was
lying
in
a
sunny
churchyard
where
a
brook
rippled
and
sparkled
in
the
daylight
and
waving
trees
whispered
together
all
night
long
where
flowers
might
nestle
close
to
the
headstone
and
moon
and
stars
shed
their
peace
upon
it
and
morning
birds
sing
sweetly
overhead
then
he
looked
up
from
the
pavement
and
rested
his
eyes
upon
the
carved
oaken
pulpit
exquisitely
beautiful
in
design
and
workmanship
he
could
not
see
the
minister
though
not
long
before
he
had
watched
him
slowly
ascending
its
winding
stair
a
man
wearing
a
ruff
about
his
neck
and
a
short
cloak
reaching
nearly
to
the
knee
meantime
the
great
church
had
been
silently
filling
its
pews
were
somber
with
men
and
its
center
radiant
with
women
in
their
fresh
sunday
attire
suddenly
a
soft
rustling
spread
through
the
pulpit
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
minister
now
appearing
above
the
pulpit
although
the
sermon
was
spoken
slowly
ben
could
understand
little
of
what
was
said
but
when
the
hymn
came
he
joined
in
with
all
his
heart
a
thousand
voices
lifted
in
love
and
praise
offered
a
grander
language
than
he
could
readily
comprehend
once
he
was
startled
during
a
pause
in
the
service
by
seeing
a
little
bag
suddenly
shaken
before
him
it
had
a
tinkling
bell
at
its
side
and
was
attached
to
a
long
stick
carried
by
one
of
the
deacons
of
the
church
not
relying
solely
upon
the
mute
appeal
of
the
poor
boxes
fastened
to
the
columns
near
the
entrance
this
more
direct
method
was
resorted
to
of
awakening
the
sympathies
of
the
charitable
fortunately
ben
had
provided
himself
with
a
few
stivers
or
the
musical
bag
must
have
tinkled
before
him
in
vain
more
than
once
a
dark
look
rose
on
our
english
boy
s
face
that
morning
he
longed
to
stand
up
and
harangue
the
people
concerning
a
peculiarity
that
filled
him
with
pain
some
of
the
men
wore
their
hats
during
the
service
or
took
them
off
whenever
the
humor
prompted
and
many
put
theirs
on
in
the
church
as
soon
as
they
arose
to
leave
no
wonder
ben
s
sense
of
propriety
was
wounded
and
yet
a
higher
sense
would
have
been
exercised
had
he
tried
to
feel
willing
that
hollanders
should
follow
the
customs
of
their
country
but
his
english
heart
said
over
and
over
again
it
is
outrageous
it
is
sinful
there
is
an
angel
called
charity
who
would
often
save
our
hearts
a
great
deal
of
trouble
if
we
would
but
let
her
in
homeward
bound
on
monday
morning
bright
and
early
our
boys
bade
farewell
to
their
kind
entertainers
and
started
on
their
homeward
journey
peter
lingered
awhile
at
the
door
for
he
and
his
sister
had
many
parting
words
to
say
as
ben
saw
them
bidding
each
other
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
kisses
as
well
as
clocks
were
wonderfully
alike
everywhere
the
english
kiss
that
his
sister
jenny
had
given
him
when
he
left
home
had
said
the
same
thing
to
him
that
the
vrouw
van
gend
s
dutch
kiss
said
to
peter
ludwig
had
taken
his
share
of
the
farewell
in
the
most
manner
possible
and
though
he
loved
his
sister
well
had
winced
a
little
at
her
making
such
a
child
of
him
as
to
put
an
extra
kiss
for
mother
upon
his
forehead
he
was
already
upon
the
canal
with
carl
and
jacob
were
they
thinking
about
sisters
or
kisses
not
a
bit
of
it
they
were
so
happy
to
be
on
skates
once
more
so
impatient
to
dart
at
once
into
the
very
heart
of
broek
that
they
spun
and
wheeled
about
like
crazy
fellows
relieving
themselves
meantime
by
muttering
something
about
peter
and
donder
not
worth
translating
even
lambert
and
ben
who
had
been
waiting
at
the
street
corner
began
to
grow
impatient
the
captain
joined
them
at
last
and
they
were
soon
on
the
canal
with
the
rest
hurry
up
peter
growled
ludwig
we
re
freezing
by
inches
there
i
knew
you
d
be
the
last
after
all
to
get
on
your
did
you
said
his
brother
looking
up
with
an
air
of
deep
interest
clever
boy
ludwig
laughed
but
tried
to
look
cross
as
he
said
i
m
in
earnest
we
must
get
home
sometime
this
now
boys
cried
peter
springing
up
as
he
fastened
the
last
buckle
there
s
a
clear
way
before
us
we
will
imagine
it
s
the
grand
race
ready
one
two
three
start
i
assure
you
that
very
little
was
said
for
the
first
half
hour
they
were
six
mercuries
skimming
the
ice
in
plain
english
they
were
lightning
no
that
is
imaginary
too
the
fact
is
one
can
not
decide
what
to
say
when
half
a
dozen
boys
are
whizzing
past
at
such
a
rate
i
can
only
tell
you
that
each
did
his
best
flying
with
bent
body
and
eager
eyes
in
and
out
among
the
placid
skates
on
the
canal
until
the
very
guard
shouted
to
them
to
hold
up
this
only
served
to
send
them
onward
with
a
power
that
startled
all
beholders
but
the
laws
of
inertia
are
stronger
even
than
canal
guards
after
a
while
jacob
slackened
his
speed
then
ludwig
then
lambert
then
carl
they
soon
halted
to
take
a
long
breath
and
finally
found
themselves
standing
in
a
group
gazing
after
peter
and
ben
who
were
still
racing
in
the
distance
as
if
their
lives
were
at
stake
it
is
very
evident
said
lambert
at
he
and
his
three
companions
started
up
again
that
neither
of
them
will
give
up
until
he
can
t
help
what
foolishness
growled
carl
to
tire
themselves
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
but
they
re
racing
in
earnest
that
s
certain
halloo
peter
s
flagging
not
so
cried
ludwig
catch
him
being
beaten
ha
ha
sneered
carl
i
tell
you
boy
benjamin
is
now
if
ludwig
disliked
anything
in
this
world
it
was
to
be
called
a
boy
probably
because
he
was
nothing
else
he
grew
indignant
at
once
humph
what
are
you
i
wonder
there
sir
now
look
and
see
if
peter
isn
t
ahead
i
think
he
is
interposed
lambert
but
i
can
t
quite
tell
at
this
i
think
he
isn
t
retorted
carl
jacob
was
growing
anxious
he
always
abhorred
an
argument
so
he
said
in
a
coaxing
tone
don
t
quarrel
don
t
quarrel
don
t
quarrel
mocked
carl
looking
back
at
jacob
as
he
skated
who
s
quarreling
poot
you
re
a
goose
i
can
t
help
that
was
jacob
s
meek
reply
see
they
are
nearing
the
turn
of
the
now
we
can
see
cried
ludwig
in
great
excitement
peter
will
make
it
first
i
he
can
t
for
ben
is
ahead
insisted
carl
gunst
that
iceboat
will
run
over
him
no
he
is
clear
they
re
a
couple
of
geese
anyhow
hurrah
they
re
at
the
turn
who
s
ahead
peter
cried
ludwig
joyfully
good
for
the
captain
shouted
lambert
and
jacob
and
carl
condescended
to
mutter
it
is
peter
after
all
i
thought
all
the
time
that
head
fellow
was
this
turn
in
the
canal
had
evidently
been
their
goal
for
the
two
racers
came
to
a
sudden
halt
after
passing
it
carl
said
something
about
being
glad
that
they
had
sense
enough
to
stop
and
rest
and
the
four
boys
skated
on
in
silence
to
overtake
their
companions
all
the
while
carl
was
secretly
wishing
that
he
had
kept
on
with
peter
and
ben
as
he
felt
sure
he
could
easily
have
come
out
winner
he
was
a
very
rapid
though
by
no
means
a
graceful
skater
ben
was
looking
at
peter
with
mingled
vexation
admiration
and
surprise
as
the
boys
drew
near
they
heard
him
saying
in
english
you
re
a
perfect
bird
on
the
ice
peter
van
holp
the
first
fellow
that
ever
beat
me
in
a
fair
race
i
can
tell
you
peter
who
understood
the
language
better
than
he
could
speak
it
returned
a
laughing
bow
at
ben
s
compliment
but
made
no
further
reply
possibly
he
was
scant
of
breath
at
the
time
now
penchamin
vat
you
do
mit
yourself
get
so
hot
as
a
fire
brick
dat
ish
no
goot
was
jacob
s
plaintive
comment
nonsense
answered
ben
this
frosty
air
will
cool
me
soon
enough
i
am
not
you
are
beaten
though
my
boy
said
lambert
in
english
and
fairly
too
how
will
it
be
i
wonder
on
the
day
of
the
grand
race
ben
flushed
and
gave
a
proud
defiant
laugh
as
if
to
say
this
was
mere
pastime
i
m
determined
to
beat
then
come
what
will
boys
and
girls
by
the
time
the
boys
reached
the
village
of
voorhout
which
stands
near
the
grand
canal
about
halfway
between
the
hague
and
haarlem
they
were
forced
to
hold
a
council
the
wind
though
moderate
at
first
had
grown
stronger
and
stronger
until
at
last
they
could
hardly
skate
against
it
the
weather
vanes
throughout
the
country
had
evidently
entered
into
a
conspiracy
no
use
trying
to
face
such
a
blow
as
this
said
ludwig
it
cuts
its
way
down
a
man
s
throat
like
a
keep
your
mouth
shut
then
grunted
the
affable
carl
who
was
as
as
a
young
ox
i
m
for
keeping
in
this
case
interposed
peter
we
must
consul
the
weakest
of
the
party
rather
than
the
the
captain
s
principle
was
all
right
but
its
application
was
not
flattering
to
master
ludwig
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
retorted
who
s
weak
not
i
for
one
but
the
wind
s
stronger
than
any
of
us
i
hope
you
ll
condescend
to
admit
that
ha
ha
laughed
van
mounen
who
could
barely
keep
his
feet
so
it
just
then
the
weather
vanes
telegraphed
to
each
other
by
a
peculiar
twitch
and
in
an
instant
the
gust
came
it
nearly
threw
the
carl
it
almost
strangled
jacob
and
quite
upset
ludwig
this
settles
the
question
shouted
peter
off
with
your
skates
we
ll
go
into
at
voorhout
they
found
a
little
inn
with
a
big
yard
the
yard
was
well
stocked
and
better
than
all
was
provided
with
a
complete
set
of
skittles
so
our
boys
soon
turned
the
detention
into
a
frolic
the
wind
was
troublesome
even
in
that
sheltered
quarter
but
they
were
on
good
standing
ground
and
did
not
mind
it
first
a
hearty
dinner
then
the
game
with
pins
as
long
as
their
arms
and
balls
as
big
as
their
heads
plenty
of
strength
left
for
rolling
and
a
clean
sweep
of
sixty
yards
for
the
strokes
no
wonder
they
were
happy
that
night
captain
peter
and
his
men
slept
soundly
no
prowling
robber
came
to
disturb
them
and
as
they
were
distributed
in
separate
rooms
they
did
not
even
have
a
bolster
battle
in
the
morning
such
a
breakfast
as
they
ate
the
landlord
looked
frightened
when
he
had
asked
them
where
they
belonged
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
broek
people
starved
their
children
it
was
a
shame
such
fine
young
gentlemen
too
fortunately
the
wind
had
tired
itself
out
and
fallen
asleep
in
the
great
sea
cradle
beyond
the
dunes
there
were
signs
of
snow
otherwise
the
weather
was
fine
it
was
mere
child
s
play
for
the
boys
to
skate
to
leyden
here
they
halted
awhile
for
peter
had
an
errand
at
the
golden
eagle
he
left
the
city
with
a
lightened
heart
boekman
had
been
at
the
hotel
read
the
note
containing
hans
s
message
and
departed
for
broek
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
your
letter
sent
him
off
so
soon
explained
the
landlord
some
rich
lady
in
broek
was
taken
bad
very
sudden
and
he
was
sent
for
in
peter
turned
pale
what
was
the
name
he
asked
indeed
it
went
in
one
ear
and
out
of
the
other
for
all
i
hindered
it
plague
on
people
who
can
t
see
a
traveler
in
comfortable
lodgings
but
they
must
whisk
him
off
before
one
can
a
lady
in
broek
did
you
say
very
gruffly
any
other
business
young
master
no
mine
host
except
that
i
and
my
comrades
here
would
like
a
bite
of
something
and
a
drink
of
hot
ah
said
the
landlord
sweetly
a
bite
you
shall
have
and
coffee
too
the
finest
in
leyden
walk
up
to
the
stove
my
masters
now
i
think
again
that
was
a
widow
lady
from
rotterdam
i
think
they
said
visiting
at
one
van
stoepel
s
if
i
mistake
ah
said
peter
greatly
relieved
they
live
in
the
white
house
by
the
schlossen
mill
now
mynheer
the
coffee
please
what
a
goose
i
was
thought
he
as
the
party
left
the
golden
eagle
to
feel
so
sure
that
it
was
my
mother
but
she
may
be
somebody
s
mother
poor
woman
for
all
that
who
can
she
be
i
wonder
there
were
not
many
upon
the
canal
that
day
between
leyden
and
haarlem
however
as
the
boys
neared
amsterdam
they
found
themselves
once
more
in
the
midst
of
a
moving
throng
the
big
ysbreeker
icebreaker
a
heavy
machine
armed
with
iron
spikes
for
breaking
the
ice
as
it
is
dragged
along
some
of
the
small
ones
are
worked
by
men
but
the
large
ones
are
drawn
by
horses
sixty
or
seventy
of
which
are
sometimes
attached
to
one
ysbreeker
had
been
at
work
for
the
first
time
that
season
but
there
was
any
amount
of
skating
ground
left
yet
three
cheers
for
home
cried
van
mounen
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
great
western
dock
westelijk
dok
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
one
and
all
hurrah
hurrah
this
trick
of
cheering
was
an
importation
among
our
party
lambert
van
mounen
had
brought
it
from
england
as
they
always
gave
it
in
english
it
was
considered
quite
an
exploit
and
when
circumstances
permitted
always
enthusiastically
performed
to
the
sore
dismay
of
their
countrymen
therefore
their
arrival
at
amsterdam
created
a
great
sensation
especially
among
the
small
boys
on
the
wharf
the
y
was
crossed
they
were
on
the
broek
canal
lambert
s
home
was
reached
first
boys
he
cried
as
he
left
them
we
ve
had
the
greatest
frolic
ever
known
in
so
we
have
van
mounen
answered
the
boys
peter
hailed
him
i
say
van
mounen
the
classes
begin
tomorrow
i
know
it
our
holiday
is
over
broek
came
in
sight
such
meetings
katrinka
was
upon
the
canal
carl
was
delighted
hilda
was
there
peter
felt
rested
in
an
instant
rychie
was
there
ludwig
and
jacob
nearly
knocked
each
other
over
in
their
eagerness
to
shake
hands
with
her
dutch
girls
are
modest
and
generally
quiet
but
they
have
very
glad
eyes
for
a
few
moments
it
was
hard
to
decide
whether
hilda
rychie
or
katrinka
felt
the
most
happy
annie
bouman
was
also
on
the
canal
looking
even
prettier
than
the
other
maidens
in
her
graceful
peasant
s
costume
but
she
did
not
mingle
with
rychie
s
party
neither
did
she
look
unusually
happy
the
one
she
liked
most
to
see
was
not
among
the
newcomers
indeed
he
was
not
upon
the
canal
at
all
she
had
not
been
near
broek
before
since
the
eve
of
saint
nicholas
for
she
was
staying
with
her
sick
grandmother
in
amsterdam
and
had
been
granted
a
brief
resting
spell
as
the
grandmother
called
it
because
she
had
been
such
a
faithful
little
nurse
night
and
day
annie
had
devoted
her
to
skating
with
all
her
might
toward
broek
and
back
again
in
the
hope
of
meeting
her
mother
on
the
canal
or
it
might
be
gretel
brinker
not
one
of
them
had
she
seen
and
she
must
hurry
back
without
even
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
mother
s
cottage
for
the
poor
helpless
grandmother
she
knew
was
by
this
time
moaning
for
someone
to
turn
her
upon
her
cot
where
can
gretel
be
thought
annie
as
she
flew
over
the
ice
she
can
almost
always
steal
a
few
moments
from
her
work
at
this
time
of
day
poor
gretel
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
must
be
to
have
a
dull
father
i
should
be
woefully
afraid
of
him
i
know
so
strong
and
yet
so
strange
annie
had
not
heard
of
his
illness
dame
brinker
and
her
affairs
received
but
little
notice
from
the
people
of
the
place
if
gretel
had
not
been
known
as
a
goose
girl
she
might
have
had
more
friends
among
the
peasantry
of
the
neighborhood
as
it
was
annie
bouman
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
feel
ashamed
to
avow
herself
by
word
and
deed
the
companion
of
gretel
and
hans
when
the
neighbors
children
laughed
at
her
for
keeping
such
poor
company
she
would
simply
flush
when
hans
was
ridiculed
or
laugh
in
a
careless
disdainful
way
but
to
hear
little
gretel
abused
always
awakened
her
wrath
goose
girl
indeed
she
would
say
i
can
tell
you
that
any
of
you
are
fitter
for
the
work
than
she
my
father
often
said
last
summer
that
it
troubled
him
to
see
such
a
patient
little
maiden
tending
geese
humph
she
would
not
harm
them
as
you
would
janzoon
kolp
and
she
would
not
tread
upon
them
as
you
might
kate
this
would
be
pretty
sure
to
start
a
laugh
at
the
clumsy
kate
s
expense
and
annie
would
walk
loftily
away
from
the
group
of
young
gossips
perhaps
some
memory
of
gretel
s
assailants
crossed
her
mind
as
she
skated
rapidly
toward
amsterdam
for
her
eyes
sparkled
ominously
and
she
more
than
once
gave
her
pretty
head
a
defiant
toss
when
that
mood
passed
such
a
bright
rosy
affectionate
look
illuminated
her
face
that
more
than
one
weary
working
man
turned
to
gaze
after
her
and
to
wish
that
he
had
a
glad
contented
lass
like
that
for
a
daughter
there
were
five
joyous
households
in
broek
that
night
the
boys
were
back
safe
and
sound
and
they
found
all
well
at
home
even
the
sick
lady
at
neighbor
van
stoepel
s
was
out
of
danger
but
the
next
morning
ah
how
stupidly
school
bells
will
when
one
is
tired
ludwig
was
sure
that
he
had
never
listened
to
anything
so
odious
even
peter
felt
pathetic
on
the
occasion
carl
said
it
was
a
shameful
thing
for
a
fellow
to
have
to
turn
out
when
his
bones
were
splitting
and
jacob
soberly
bade
ben
and
walked
off
with
his
satchel
as
if
it
weighed
a
hundred
pounds
the
crisis
while
the
boys
are
nursing
their
fatigue
we
will
take
a
peep
into
the
brinker
cottage
can
it
be
that
gretel
and
her
mother
have
not
stirred
since
we
saw
them
last
that
the
sick
man
upon
the
bed
has
not
even
turned
over
it
was
four
days
ago
and
there
is
the
sad
group
just
as
it
was
before
no
not
precisely
the
same
for
raff
brinker
is
paler
his
fever
is
gone
though
he
knows
nothing
of
what
is
passing
then
they
were
alone
in
the
bare
clean
room
now
there
is
another
group
in
an
opposite
corner
boekman
is
there
talking
in
a
low
tone
with
a
stout
young
man
who
listens
intently
the
stout
young
man
is
his
student
and
assistant
hans
is
there
also
he
stands
near
the
window
respectfully
waiting
until
he
shall
be
accosted
you
see
vollenhoven
said
boekman
it
is
a
clear
case
of
and
here
the
doctor
went
off
into
a
queer
jumble
of
latin
and
dutch
that
i
can
not
conveniently
translate
after
a
while
as
vollenhoven
looked
at
him
rather
blankly
the
learned
man
condescended
to
speak
to
him
in
simpler
phrase
it
is
probably
like
rip
donderdunck
s
case
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
mumbling
tone
he
fell
from
the
top
of
voppelploot
s
windmill
after
the
accident
the
man
was
stupid
and
finally
became
idiotic
in
time
he
lay
helpless
like
yon
fellow
on
the
bed
moaned
too
like
him
and
kept
constantly
lifting
his
hand
to
his
head
my
learned
friend
von
choppem
performed
an
operation
upon
this
donderdunck
and
discovered
under
the
skull
a
small
dark
sac
which
pressed
upon
the
brain
this
had
been
the
cause
of
the
trouble
my
friend
von
choppem
removed
it
a
splendid
operation
you
see
according
to
celsius
and
here
the
doctor
again
went
off
into
latin
did
the
man
live
asked
the
assistant
respectfully
boekman
scowled
that
is
of
no
consequence
i
believe
he
died
but
why
not
fix
your
mind
on
the
grand
features
of
the
case
consider
a
moment
how
and
he
plunged
into
latin
mysteries
more
deeply
than
ever
but
mynheer
gently
persisted
the
student
who
knew
that
the
doctor
would
not
rise
to
the
surface
for
hours
unless
pulled
at
once
from
his
favorite
depths
mynheer
you
have
other
engagements
today
three
legs
in
amsterdam
you
remember
and
an
eye
in
broek
and
that
tumor
up
the
the
tumor
can
wait
said
the
doctor
reflectively
that
is
another
beautiful
case
a
beautiful
case
the
woman
has
not
lifted
her
head
from
her
shoulder
for
two
months
magnificent
tumor
sir
the
doctor
by
this
time
was
speaking
aloud
he
had
quite
forgotten
where
he
was
vollenhoven
made
another
attempt
this
poor
fellow
on
the
bed
mynheer
do
you
think
you
can
save
him
ah
indeed
certainly
stammered
the
doctor
suddenly
perceiving
that
he
had
been
talking
rather
off
the
point
certainly
that
is
i
hope
if
anyone
in
holland
can
mynheer
murmured
the
assistant
with
honest
bluntness
it
is
the
doctor
looked
displeased
growled
out
a
tender
request
for
the
student
to
talk
less
and
beckoned
hans
to
draw
near
this
strange
man
had
a
great
horror
of
speaking
to
women
especially
on
surgical
matters
one
can
never
tell
he
said
what
moment
the
creatures
will
scream
or
therefore
he
explained
raff
brinker
s
case
to
hans
and
told
him
what
he
believed
should
be
done
to
save
the
patient
hans
listened
attentively
growing
red
and
pale
by
turns
and
throwing
quick
anxious
glances
toward
the
bed
it
may
kill
the
father
did
you
say
mynheer
he
exclaimed
at
last
in
a
trembling
whisper
it
may
my
boy
but
i
have
a
strong
belief
that
it
will
cure
and
not
kill
ah
if
boys
were
not
such
dunces
i
could
lay
the
whole
matter
before
you
but
it
would
be
of
no
hans
looked
blank
at
this
compliment
it
would
be
of
no
use
repeated
boekman
indignantly
a
great
operation
is
proposed
but
one
might
as
well
do
it
with
a
hatchet
the
only
question
asked
is
will
it
kill
the
question
is
everything
to
us
mynheer
said
hans
with
tearful
dignity
boekman
looked
at
him
in
sudden
dismay
ah
exactly
so
you
are
right
boy
i
am
a
fool
good
boy
one
does
not
wish
one
s
father
killed
of
course
i
am
a
will
he
die
mynheer
if
this
sickness
goes
on
humph
this
is
no
new
illness
the
same
thing
growing
worse
ever
instant
pressure
on
the
brain
will
take
him
off
soon
like
that
said
the
doctor
snapping
his
fingers
and
the
operation
may
save
him
pursued
hans
how
soon
mynheer
can
we
know
boekman
grew
impatient
in
a
day
perhaps
an
hour
talk
with
your
mother
boy
and
let
her
decide
my
time
is
hans
approached
his
mother
at
first
when
she
looked
up
at
him
he
could
not
utter
a
syllable
then
turning
his
eyes
away
he
said
in
a
firm
voice
i
must
speak
with
the
mother
quick
little
gretel
who
could
not
quite
understand
what
was
passing
threw
rather
an
indignant
look
at
hans
and
walked
away
come
back
gretel
and
sit
down
said
hans
sorrowfully
she
obeyed
dame
brinker
and
her
boy
stood
by
the
window
while
the
doctor
and
his
assistant
bending
over
the
bedside
conversed
together
in
a
low
tone
there
was
no
danger
of
disturbing
the
patient
he
appeared
like
one
blind
and
deaf
only
his
faint
piteous
moans
showed
him
to
be
a
living
man
hans
was
talking
earnestly
and
in
a
low
voice
for
he
did
not
wish
his
sister
to
hear
with
dry
parted
lips
dame
brinker
leaned
toward
him
searching
his
face
as
if
suspecting
a
meaning
beyond
his
words
once
she
gave
a
quick
frightened
sob
that
made
gretel
start
but
after
that
she
listened
calmly
when
hans
ceased
to
speak
his
mother
turned
gave
one
long
agonized
look
at
her
husband
lying
there
so
pale
and
unconscious
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
poor
little
gretel
what
did
all
this
mean
she
looked
with
questioning
eyes
at
hans
he
was
standing
but
his
head
was
bent
as
if
in
prayer
at
the
doctor
he
was
gently
feeling
her
father
s
head
and
looked
like
one
examining
some
curious
stone
at
the
assistant
the
man
coughed
and
turned
away
at
her
mother
ah
little
gretel
that
was
the
best
you
could
do
to
kneel
beside
her
and
twine
your
warm
young
arms
about
her
neck
to
weep
and
implore
god
to
listen
when
the
mother
arose
boekman
with
a
show
of
trouble
in
his
eyes
asked
gruffly
well
jufvrouw
shall
it
be
done
will
it
pain
him
mynheer
she
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
i
can
not
say
probably
not
shall
it
be
done
it
may
cure
him
you
said
and
mynheer
did
you
tell
my
boy
that
perhaps
perhaps
she
could
not
finish
yes
jufvrouw
i
said
the
patient
might
sink
under
the
operation
but
we
hope
it
may
prove
he
looked
at
his
watch
the
assistant
moved
impatiently
toward
the
window
come
jufvrouw
time
presses
yes
or
no
hans
wound
his
arm
about
his
mother
it
was
not
his
usual
way
he
even
leaned
his
head
against
her
shoulder
the
meester
awaits
an
answer
he
whispered
dame
brinker
had
long
been
head
of
her
house
in
every
sense
many
a
time
she
had
been
very
stern
with
hans
ruling
him
with
a
strong
hand
and
rejoicing
in
her
motherly
discipline
now
she
felt
so
weak
so
helpless
it
was
something
to
feel
that
firm
embrace
there
was
strength
even
in
the
touch
of
that
yellow
hair
she
turned
to
her
boy
imploringly
oh
hans
what
shall
i
say
say
what
god
tells
thee
mother
answered
hans
bowing
his
head
one
quick
questioning
prayer
to
heaven
rose
from
the
mother
s
heart
the
answer
came
she
turned
toward
boekman
it
is
right
mynheer
i
humph
grunted
the
doctor
as
if
to
say
you
ve
been
long
enough
about
then
he
conferred
a
moment
with
his
assistant
who
listened
with
great
outward
deference
but
was
inwardly
rejoicing
at
the
grand
joke
he
would
have
to
tell
his
fellow
students
he
had
actually
seen
a
tear
in
old
boekman
s
eye
meanwhile
gretel
looked
on
in
trembling
silence
but
when
she
saw
the
doctor
open
a
leather
case
and
take
out
one
sharp
gleaming
instrument
after
another
she
sprang
forward
oh
mother
the
poor
father
meant
no
wrong
are
they
going
to
murder
him
i
do
not
know
child
screamed
dame
brinker
looking
fiercely
at
gretel
i
do
not
this
will
not
do
jufvrouw
said
boekman
sternly
and
at
the
same
time
he
cast
a
quick
penetrating
look
at
hans
you
and
the
girl
must
leave
the
room
the
boy
may
dame
brinker
drew
herself
up
in
an
instant
her
eyes
flashed
her
whole
countenance
was
changed
she
looked
like
one
who
had
never
wept
never
felt
a
moment
s
weakness
her
voice
was
low
but
decided
i
stay
with
my
husband
boekman
looked
astonished
his
orders
were
seldom
disregarded
in
this
style
for
an
instant
his
eye
met
hers
you
may
remain
jufvrouw
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
gretel
had
already
disappeared
in
one
corner
of
the
cottage
was
a
small
closet
where
her
rough
boxlike
bed
was
fastened
against
the
wall
none
would
think
of
the
trembling
little
creature
crouching
there
in
the
dark
boekman
took
off
his
heavy
coat
filled
an
earthen
basin
with
water
and
placed
it
near
the
bed
then
turning
to
hans
he
asked
can
i
depend
upon
you
boy
you
can
i
believe
you
stand
at
the
head
here
your
mother
may
sit
at
your
right
and
he
placed
a
chair
near
the
cot
remember
jufvrouw
there
must
be
no
cries
no
dame
brinker
answered
him
with
a
look
he
was
satisfied
now
oh
that
case
with
the
terrible
instruments
the
assistant
lifted
them
gretel
who
had
been
peering
with
brimming
eyes
through
the
crack
of
the
closet
door
could
remain
silent
no
longer
she
rushed
frantically
across
the
apartment
seized
her
hood
and
ran
from
the
cottage
gretel
and
hilda
it
was
recess
hour
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
schoolhouse
bell
the
canal
seemed
to
give
a
tremendous
shout
and
grow
suddenly
alive
with
boys
and
girls
dozens
of
gaily
clad
children
were
skating
in
and
out
among
each
other
and
all
their
merriment
of
the
morning
was
relieving
itself
in
song
and
shout
and
laughter
there
was
nothing
to
check
the
flow
of
frolic
not
a
thought
of
schoolbooks
came
out
with
them
into
the
sunshine
latin
arithmetic
grammar
all
were
locked
up
for
an
hour
in
the
dingy
schoolroom
the
teacher
might
be
a
noun
if
he
wished
and
a
proper
one
at
that
but
they
meant
to
enjoy
themselves
as
long
as
the
skating
was
as
perfect
as
this
it
made
no
difference
whether
holland
were
on
the
north
pole
or
the
equator
and
as
for
philosophy
how
could
they
bother
themselves
with
inertia
and
gravitation
and
such
things
when
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
keep
from
getting
knocked
over
in
the
commotion
in
the
height
of
the
fun
one
of
the
children
called
out
what
is
that
what
where
cried
a
dozen
voices
why
don
t
you
see
that
dark
thing
over
there
by
the
idiot
s
i
don
t
see
anything
said
one
i
do
shouted
another
it
s
a
where
s
any
dog
put
in
a
squeaky
voice
that
we
have
heard
before
it
s
no
such
thing
it
s
a
heap
of
pooh
voost
retorted
another
gruffly
that
s
about
as
near
the
fact
as
you
ever
get
it
s
the
goose
girl
gretel
looking
for
well
what
of
it
squeaked
voost
isn
t
she
a
bundle
of
rags
i
d
like
to
know
ha
ha
pretty
good
for
you
voost
you

a
medal
for

yet
if

d
get
something
else
if
her
brother
hans
were
here
i
ll
warrant
you
would
said
a
little
fellow
with
a
cold
in
his
head
as
hans
was
not
there
voost
could
afford
to
scout
the
insinuation
who
cares
for
him
little
sneezer
i
d
fight
a
dozen
like
him
any
day
and
you
in
the
you
would
would
you
i
d
like
to
catch
you
all
at
it
and
by
way
of
proving
his
words
the
sneezer
skated
off
at
the
top
of
his
speed
just
then
a
general
chase
after
three
of
the
biggest
boys
of
the
school
was
proposed
and
friend
and
foe
frolicsome
as
ever
were
soon
united
in
a
common
cause
only
one
of
all
that
happy
throng
remembered
the
dark
little
form
by
the
idiot
s
cottage
poor
frightened
little
gretel
she
was
not
thinking
of
them
though
their
merry
laughter
floated
lightly
toward
her
making
her
feel
like
one
in
a
dream
how
loud
the
moans
were
behind
the
darkened
window
what
if
those
strange
men
were
really
killing
her
father
the
thought
made
her
spring
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
horror
ah
no
she
sobbed
sinking
upon
the
frozen
mound
of
earth
where
she
had
been
sitting
mother
is
there
and
hans
they
will
care
for
him
but
how
pale
they
were
and
even
hans
was
crying
why
did
the
cross
old
meester
keep
him
and
send
me
away
she
thought
i
could
have
clung
to
the
mother
and
kissed
her
that
always
makes
her
stroke
my
hair
and
speak
gently
even
after
she
has
scolded
me
how
quiet
it
is
now
oh
if
the
father
should
die
and
hans
and
the
mother
what
would
i
do
and
gretel
shivering
with
cold
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
the
poor
child
had
been
tasked
beyond
her
strength
during
the
past
four
days
through
all
she
had
been
her
mother
s
willing
little
handmaiden
soothing
helping
and
cheering
the
woman
by
day
and
watching
and
praying
beside
her
all
the
long
night
she
knew
that
something
terrible
and
mysterious
was
taking
place
at
this
moment
something
that
had
been
too
terrible
and
mysterious
for
even
kind
good
hans
to
tell
then
new
thoughts
came
why
had
not
hans
told
her
it
was
a
shame
it
was
her
father
as
well
as
his
she
was
no
baby
she
had
once
taken
a
sharp
knife
from
the
father
s
hand
she
had
even
drawn
him
away
from
the
mother
on
that
awful
night
when
hans
as
big
as
he
was
could
not
help
her
why
then
must
she
be
treated
like
one
who
could
do
nothing
oh
how
very
still
it
was
how
bitter
bitter
cold
if
annie
bouman
had
only
stayed
home
instead
of
going
to
amsterdam
it
wouldn
t
be
so
lonely
how
cold
her
feet
were
growing
was
it
the
moaning
that
made
her
feel
as
if
she
were
floating
in
the
air
this
would
not
do
the
mother
might
need
her
help
at
any
moment
rousing
herself
with
an
effort
gretel
sat
upright
rubbing
her
eyes
and
wondering
wondering
that
the
sky
was
so
bright
and
blue
wondering
at
the
stillness
in
the
cottage
more
than
all
at
the
laughter
rising
and
falling
in
the
distance
soon
she
sank
down
again
the
strange
medley
of
thought
growing
more
and
more
confused
in
her
bewildered
brain
what
a
strange
lip
the
meester
had
how
the
stork
s
nest
upon
the
roof
seemed
to
rustle
and
whisper
down
to
her
how
bright
those
knives
were
in
the
leather
case
brighter
perhaps
than
the
silver
skates
if
she
had
but
worn
her
new
jacket
she
would
not
shiver
so
the
new
jacket
was
pretty
the
only
pretty
thing
she
had
ever
worn
god
had
taken
care
of
her
father
so
long
he
would
do
it
still
if
those
two
men
would
but
go
away
ah
now
the
meesters
were
on
the
roof
they
were
clambering
to
the
top
no
it
was
her
mother
and
hans
or
the
storks
it
was
so
dark
who
could
tell
and
the
mound
rocking
swinging
in
that
strange
way
how
sweetly
the
birds
were
singing
they
must
be
winter
birds
for
the
air
was
thick
with
icicles
not
one
bird
but
twenty
oh
hear
them
mother
wake
me
mother
for
the
race
i
am
so
tired
with
crying
and
crying
a
firm
hand
was
laid
upon
her
shoulder
get
up
little
girl
cried
a
kind
voice
this
will
not
do
for
you
to
lie
here
and
gretel
slowly
raised
her
head
she
was
so
sleepy
that
it
seemed
nothing
strange
to
her
that
hilda
van
gleck
should
be
leaning
over
her
looking
with
kind
beautiful
eyes
into
her
face
she
had
often
dreamed
it
before
but
she
had
never
dreamed
that
hilda
was
shaking
her
roughly
almost
dragging
her
by
main
force
never
dreamed
that
she
heard
her
saying
gretel
gretel
brinker
you
must
wake
this
was
real
gretel
looked
up
still
the
lovely
delicate
young
lady
was
shaking
rubbing
fairly
pounding
her
it
must
be
a
dream
no
there
was
the
cottage
and
the
stork
s
nest
and
the
meester
s
coach
by
the
canal
she
could
see
them
now
quite
plainly
her
hands
were
tingling
her
feet
throbbing
hilda
was
forcing
her
to
walk
at
last
gretel
began
to
feel
like
herself
again
i
have
been
asleep
she
faltered
rubbing
her
eyes
with
both
hands
and
looking
very
much
ashamed
yes
indeed
entirely
too
much
asleep
laughed
hilda
whose
lips
were
very
pale
but
you
are
well
enough
now
lean
upon
me
gretel
there
keep
moving
you
will
soon
be
warm
enough
to
go
by
the
fire
now
let
me
take
you
into
the
oh
no
no
no
jufvrouw
not
in
there
the
meester
is
there
he
sent
me
away
hilda
was
puzzled
but
she
wisely
forebore
to
ask
at
present
for
an
explanation
very
well
gretel
try
to
walk
faster
i
saw
you
upon
the
mound
some
time
ago
but
i
thought
you
were
playing
that
is
right
keep
all
this
time
the
kindhearted
girl
had
been
forcing
gretel
to
walk
up
and
down
supporting
her
with
one
arm
and
with
the
other
striving
as
well
as
she
could
to
take
off
her
own
warm
sacque
suddenly
gretel
suspected
her
intention
oh
jufvrouw
jufvrouw
she
cried
imploringly
please
never
think
of
such
a
thing
as
that
oh
please
keep
it
on
i
am
burning
all
over
jufvrouw
i
really
am
burning
not
burning
exactly
but
pins
and
needles
pricking
all
over
me
oh
jufvrouw
don
t
the
poor
child
s
dismay
was
so
genuine
that
hilda
hastened
to
reassure
her
very
well
gretel
move
your
arms
then
so
why
your
cheeks
are
as
pink
as
roses
already
i
think
the
meester
would
let
you
in
now
he
certainly
would
is
your
father
so
very
ill
ah
jufvrouw
cried
gretel
weeping
afresh
he
is
dying
i
think
there
are
two
meesters
in
with
him
at
this
moment
and
the
mother
has
scarcely
spoken
today
can
you
hear
him
moan
jufvrouw
she
added
with
sudden
terror
the
air
buzzes
so
i
can
not
hear
he
may
be
dead
oh
i
do
wish
i
could
hear
him
hilda
listened
the
cottage
was
very
near
but
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
something
told
her
that
gretel
was
right
she
ran
to
the
window
you
can
not
see
there
my
lady
sobbed
gretel
eagerly
the
mother
has
oiled
paper
hanging
inside
but
at
the
other
one
in
the
south
end
of
the
cottage
you
can
look
in
where
the
paper
is
hilda
in
her
anxiety
ran
around
past
the
corner
where
the
low
roof
was
fringed
with
its
loosened
thatch
a
sudden
thought
checked
her
it
is
not
right
for
me
to
peep
into
another
s
house
in
this
way
she
said
to
herself
then
softly
calling
to
gretel
she
added
in
a
whisper
you
may
look
perhaps
he
is
only
gretel
tried
to
walk
briskly
toward
the
spot
but
her
limbs
were
trembling
hilda
hastened
to
her
support
you
are
sick
yourself
i
fear
she
said
kindly
no
not
sick
jufvrouw
but
my
heart
cries
all
the
time
now
even
when
my
eyes
are
as
dry
as
yours
why
jufvrouw
your
eyes
are
not
dry
are
you
crying
for
us
oh
jufvrouw
if
god
sees
you
oh
i
know
father
will
get
better
and
the
little
creature
even
while
reaching
to
look
through
the
tiny
window
kissed
hilda
s
hand
again
and
again
the
sash
was
sadly
patched
and
broken
a
torn
piece
of
paper
hung
halfway
down
across
it
gretel
s
face
was
pressed
to
the
window
can
you
see
anything
whispered
hilda
at
last
yes
the
father
lies
very
still
his
head
is
bandaged
and
all
their
eyes
are
fastened
upon
him
oh
jufvrouw
almost
screamed
gretel
as
she
started
back
and
by
a
quick
dexterous
movement
shook
off
her
heavy
wooden
shoes
i
must
go
in
to
my
mother
will
you
come
with
me
not
now
the
bell
is
ringing
i
shall
come
again
soon
gretel
scarcely
heard
the
words
she
remembered
for
many
a
day
afterward
the
bright
pitying
smile
on
hilda
s
face
as
she
turned
away
the
awakening
an
angel
could
not
have
entered
the
cottage
more
noiselessly
gretel
not
daring
to
look
at
anyone
slid
softly
to
her
mother
s
side
the
room
was
very
still
she
could
hear
the
old
doctor
breathe
she
could
almost
hear
the
sparks
as
they
fell
into
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
the
mother
s
hand
was
very
cold
but
a
burning
spot
glowed
on
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
like
a
deer
s
so
bright
so
sad
so
eager
at
last
there
was
a
movement
upon
the
bed
very
slight
but
enough
to
cause
them
all
to
start
boekman
leaned
eagerly
forward
another
movement
the
large
hands
so
white
and
soft
for
a
poor
man
s
hand
twitched
then
raised
itself
steadily
toward
the
forehead
it
felt
the
bandage
not
in
a
restless
crazy
way
but
with
a
questioning
movement
that
caused
even
boekman
to
hold
his
breath
steady
steady
said
a
voice
that
sounded
very
strange
to
gretel
shift
that
mat
higher
boys
now
throw
on
the
clay
the
waters
are
rising
fast
no
time
to
dame
brinker
sprang
forward
like
a
young
panther
she
seized
his
hands
and
leaning
over
him
cried
raff
raff
boy
speak
to
me
is
it
you
meitje
he
asked
faintly
i
have
been
asleep
hurt
i
think
where
is
little
hans
here
i
am
father
shouted
hans
half
mad
with
joy
but
the
doctor
held
him
back
he
knows
us
screamed
dame
brinker
great
god
he
knows
us
gretel
gretel
come
see
your
father
in
vain
boekman
commanded
silence
and
tried
to
force
them
from
the
bedside
he
could
not
keep
them
off
hans
and
the
mother
laughed
and
cried
together
as
they
hung
over
the
newly
awakened
man
gretel
made
no
sound
but
gazed
at
them
all
with
glad
startled
eyes
her
father
was
speaking
in
a
faint
voice
is
the
baby
asleep
meitje
the
baby
echoed
dame
brinker
oh
gretel
that
is
you
and
he
calls
hans
little
ten
years
asleep
oh
mynheer
you
have
saved
us
all
he
has
known
nothing
for
ten
years
children
why
don
t
you
thank
the
meester
the
good
woman
was
beside
herself
with
joy
boekman
said
nothing
but
as
his
eye
met
hers
he
pointed
upward
she
understood
so
did
hans
and
gretel
with
one
accord
they
knelt
by
the
cot
side
by
side
dame
brinker
felt
for
her
husband
s
hand
even
while
she
was
praying
boekman
s
head
was
bowed
the
assistant
stood
by
the
hearth
with
his
back
toward
them
why
do
you
pray
murmured
the
father
looking
feebly
from
the
bed
as
they
rose
is
it
god
s
day
it
was
not
sunday
but
his
vrouw
bowed
her
head
she
could
not
speak
then
we
should
have
a
chapter
said
raff
brinker
speaking
slowly
and
with
difficulty
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
i
am
very
very
weak
mayhap
the
minister
will
read
it
to
gretel
lifted
the
big
dutch
bible
from
its
carved
shelf
boekman
rather
dismayed
at
being
called
a
minister
coughed
and
handed
the
volume
to
his
assistant
read
he
murmured
these
people
must
be
kept
quiet
or
the
man
will
die
when
the
chapter
was
finished
dame
brinker
motioned
mysteriously
to
the
rest
by
way
of
telling
them
that
her
husband
was
asleep
now
jufvrouw
said
the
doctor
in
a
subdued
tone
as
he
drew
on
his
thick
woolen
mittens
there
must
be
perfect
quiet
you
understand
this
is
truly
a
most
remarkable
case
i
shall
come
again
tomorrow
give
the
patient
no
food
today
and
bowing
hastily
he
left
the
cottage
followed
by
his
assistant
his
grand
coach
was
not
far
away
the
driver
had
kept
the
horses
moving
slowly
up
and
down
by
the
canal
nearly
all
the
time
the
doctor
had
been
in
the
cottage
hans
went
out
also
may
god
bless
you
mynheer
he
said
blushing
and
trembling
i
can
never
repay
you
but
if
yes
you
can
interrupted
the
doctor
crossly
you
can
use
your
wits
when
the
patient
wakes
again
this
clacking
and
sniveling
is
enough
to
kill
a
well
man
let
alone
one
lying
on
the
edge
of
his
grave
if
you
want
your
father
to
get
well
keep
em
so
saying
boekman
without
another
word
stalked
off
to
meet
his
coach
leaving
hans
standing
there
with
eyes
and
mouth
wide
open
hilda
was
reprimanded
severely
that
day
for
returning
late
to
school
after
recess
and
for
imperfect
recitations
she
had
remained
near
the
cottage
until
she
heard
dame
brinker
laugh
until
she
had
heard
hans
say
here
i
am
father
and
then
she
had
gone
back
to
her
lessons
what
wonder
that
she
missed
them
how
could
she
get
a
long
string
of
latin
verbs
by
heart
when
her
heart
did
not
care
a
fig
for
them
but
would
keep
saying
to
itself
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
am
so
glad
bones
and
tongues
bones
are
strange
things
one
would
suppose
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
about
school
affairs
but
they
do
even
jacob
poot
s
bones
buried
as
they
were
in
flesh
were
sharp
in
the
matter
of
study
hours
early
on
the
morning
of
his
return
they
ached
through
and
through
giving
jacob
a
twinge
at
every
stroke
of
the
school
bell
as
if
to
say
stop
that
clapper
there
s
trouble
in
after
school
on
the
contrary
they
were
quiet
and
comfortable
in
fact
seemed
to
be
taking
a
nap
among
their
cushions
the
other
boys
bones
behaved
in
a
similar
manner
but
that
is
not
so
remarkable
being
nearer
the
daylight
than
jacob
s
they
might
be
expected
to
be
more
learned
in
the
ways
of
the
world
master
ludwig
s
especially
were
like
beauty
only
skin
deep
they
were
the
most
knowing
bones
you
ever
heard
of
just
put
before
him
ever
so
quietly
a
grammar
book
with
a
long
lessons
marked
in
it
and
immediately
the
sly
bone
over
his
eyes
would
set
up
such
an
aching
request
him
to
go
to
the
garret
for
your
foot
stove
instantly
the
bones
would
remind
him
that
he
was
too
ask
him
to
go
to
the
confectioner
s
a
mile
away
and
presto
not
a
bone
would
remember
that
it
had
ever
been
used
before
bearing
all
this
in
mind
you
will
not
wonder
when
i
tell
you
that
our
five
boys
were
among
the
happiest
of
the
happy
throng
pouring
forth
from
the
schoolhouse
that
day
peter
was
in
excellent
spirits
he
had
heard
through
hilda
of
dame
brinker
s
laugh
and
of
hans
s
joyous
words
and
he
needed
no
further
proof
that
raff
brinker
was
a
cured
man
in
fact
the
news
had
gone
forth
in
every
direction
for
miles
around
persons
who
had
never
before
cared
for
the
brinkers
or
even
mentioned
them
except
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
or
a
shrug
of
pretended
pity
now
became
singularly
familiar
with
every
point
of
their
history
there
was
no
end
to
the
number
of
ridiculous
stories
that
were
flying
about
hilda
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
had
stopped
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
doctor
s
coachman
as
he
stood
by
the
horses
pommelling
his
chest
and
clapping
his
hands
her
kind
heart
was
overflowing
she
could
not
help
pausing
to
tell
the
cold
man
that
she
thought
the
doctor
would
be
out
soon
she
even
hinted
to
him
that
she
suspected
only
suspected
that
a
wonderful
cure
had
been
performed
an
idiot
brought
to
his
senses
nay
she
was
sure
of
it
for
she
had
heard
his
widow
laugh
no
not
his
widow
of
course
but
his
wife
for
the
man
was
as
much
alive
as
anybody
and
for
all
she
knew
sitting
up
and
talking
like
a
lawyer
all
this
was
very
indiscreet
hilda
in
an
impenitent
sort
of
way
felt
it
to
be
so
but
it
is
always
so
delightful
to
impart
pleasant
or
surprising
news
she
went
tripping
along
by
the
canal
quite
resolved
to
repeat
the
sin
ad
infinitum
and
tell
nearly
every
girl
and
boy
in
the
school
meantime
janzoon
kolp
came
skating
by
of
course
in
two
seconds
he
was
striking
slippery
attitudes
and
shouting
saucy
things
to
the
coachman
who
stared
at
him
in
indolent
disdain
this
to
janzoon
was
equivalent
to
an
invitation
to
draw
nearer
the
coachman
was
now
upon
his
box
gathering
up
the
reins
and
grumbling
at
his
horses
janzoon
accosted
him
i
say
what
s
going
on
at
the
idiot
s
cottage
is
your
boss
in
there
coachman
nodded
mysteriously
whew
whistled
janzoon
drawing
closer
old
brinker
dead
the
driver
grew
big
with
importance
and
silent
in
proportion
see
here
old
pincushion
i
d
run
home
yonder
and
get
you
a
chunk
of
gingerbread
if
i
thought
you
could
open
your
old
pincushion
was
human
long
hours
of
waiting
had
made
him
ravenously
hungry
at
janzoon
s
hint
his
countenance
showed
signs
of
a
collapse
that
s
right
old
fellow
pursued
his
tempter
hurry
up
what
news
old
brinker
dead
no
cured
got
his
wits
said
the
coachman
shooting
forth
his
words
one
at
a
time
like
so
many
bullets
like
bullets
figuratively
speaking
they
hit
janzoon
kolp
he
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
goede
gunst
you
don
t
say
so
the
man
pressed
his
lips
together
and
looked
significantly
toward
master
kolp
s
shabby
residence
just
then
janzoon
saw
a
group
of
boys
in
the
distance
hailing
them
in
a
rowdy
style
common
to
boys
of
his
stamp
all
over
the
world
weather
in
africa
japan
amsterdam
or
paris
he
scampered
toward
them
forgetting
coachman
gingerbread
everything
but
the
wonderful
news
therefore
by
sundown
it
was
well
known
throughout
the
neighboring
country
that
boekman
chancing
to
stop
at
the
cottage
had
given
the
idiot
brinker
a
tremendous
dose
of
medicine
as
brown
as
gingerbread
it
had
taken
six
men
to
hold
him
while
it
was
poured
down
the
idiot
had
immediately
sprung
to
his
feet
in
full
possession
of
all
his
faculties
knocked
over
the
doctor
or
thrashed
him
there
was
admitted
to
be
a
slight
uncertainty
as
to
which
of
these
penalties
was
inflicted
then
sat
down
and
addressed
him
for
all
the
world
like
a
lawyer
after
that
he
had
turned
and
spoken
beautifully
to
his
wife
and
children
dame
brinker
had
laughed
herself
into
violent
hysterics
hans
had
said
here
i
am
father
your
own
dear
son
and
gretel
had
said
here
i
am
father
your
own
dear
gretel
and
the
doctor
had
afterward
been
seen
leaning
back
in
his
carriage
looking
just
as
white
as
a
corpse
a
new
alarm
when
boekman
called
the
next
day
at
the
brinker
cottage
he
could
not
help
noticing
the
cheerful
comfortable
aspect
of
the
place
an
atmosphere
of
happiness
breathed
upon
him
as
he
opened
the
door
dame
brinker
sat
complacently
knitting
beside
the
bed
her
husband
was
enjoying
a
tranquil
slumber
and
gretel
was
noiselessly
kneading
rye
bread
on
the
table
in
the
corner
the
doctor
did
not
remain
long
he
asked
a
few
simple
questions
appeared
satisfied
with
the
answers
and
after
feeling
his
patient
s
pulse
said
ah
very
weak
yet
jufvrouw
very
weak
indeed
he
must
have
nourishment
you
may
begin
to
feed
the
patient
ahem
not
too
much
but
what
you
do
give
him
let
it
be
strong
and
of
the
black
bread
we
have
mynheer
and
porridge
replied
dame
brinker
cheerily
they
have
always
agreed
with
him
tut
tut
said
the
doctor
frowning
nothing
of
the
kind
he
must
have
the
juice
of
fresh
meat
white
bread
dried
and
toasted
good
malaga
wine
and
ahem
the
man
looks
cold
give
him
more
covering
something
light
and
warm
where
is
the
boy
hans
mynheer
has
gone
into
broek
to
look
for
work
he
will
be
back
soon
will
the
meester
please
be
seated
whether
the
hard
polished
stool
offered
by
dame
brinker
did
not
look
particularly
tempting
or
whether
the
dame
herself
frightened
him
partly
because
she
was
a
woman
and
partly
because
an
anxious
distressed
look
had
suddenly
appeared
in
her
face
i
can
not
say
certain
it
is
that
our
eccentric
doctor
looked
hurriedly
about
him
muttered
something
about
an
extraordinary
case
bowed
and
disappeared
before
dame
brinker
had
time
to
say
another
word
strange
that
the
visit
of
their
good
benefactor
should
have
left
a
cloud
yet
so
it
was
gretel
frowned
an
anxious
childish
frown
and
kneaded
the
bread
dough
violently
without
looking
up
dame
brinker
hurried
to
her
husband
s
bedside
leaned
over
him
and
fell
into
silent
but
passionate
weeping
in
a
moment
hans
entered
why
mother
he
whispered
in
alarm
what
ails
thee
is
the
father
worse
she
turned
her
quivering
face
toward
him
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
distress
yes
he
is
starving
perishing
a
meester
said
hans
turned
pale
what
does
this
mean
mother
we
must
feed
him
at
once
here
gretel
give
me
the
nay
cried
his
mother
distractedly
yet
without
raising
her
voice
it
may
kill
him
our
poor
fare
is
too
heavy
for
him
oh
hans
he
will
die
the
father
will
die
if
we
use
him
this
way
he
must
have
meat
and
sweet
wine
and
a
dekbed
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
sobbed
wringing
her
hands
there
is
not
a
stiver
in
the
gretel
pouted
it
was
the
only
way
she
could
express
sympathy
just
then
her
tears
fell
one
by
one
into
the
dough
did
the
meester
say
he
must
have
these
things
mother
asked
hans
yes
he
well
mother
don
t
cry
he
shall
have
them
i
shall
bring
meat
and
wine
before
night
take
the
cover
from
my
bed
i
can
sleep
in
the
yes
hans
but
it
is
heavy
scant
as
it
is
the
meester
said
he
must
have
something
light
and
warm
he
will
perish
our
peat
is
giving
out
hans
the
father
has
wasted
it
sorely
throwing
it
on
when
i
was
not
looking
dear
never
mind
mother
whispered
hans
cheerfully
we
can
cut
down
the
willow
tree
and
burn
it
if
need
be
but
i
ll
bring
home
something
tonight
there
must
be
work
in
amsterdam
though
there
s
none
in
broek
never
fear
mother
the
worst
trouble
of
all
is
past
we
can
brave
anything
now
that
the
father
is
himself
aye
sobbed
dame
brinker
hastily
drying
her
eyes
that
is
true
of
course
it
is
look
at
him
mother
how
softly
he
sleeps
do
you
think
god
would
let
him
starve
just
after
giving
him
back
to
us
why
mother
i
m
as
sure
of
getting
all
the
father
needs
as
if
my
pocket
were
bursting
with
gold
there
now
don
t
and
hurriedly
kissing
her
hans
caught
up
his
skates
and
slipped
from
the
cottage
poor
hans
disappointed
in
his
morning
s
errand
half
sickened
with
this
new
trouble
he
wore
a
brave
look
and
tried
to
whistle
as
he
tramped
resolutely
off
with
the
firm
intention
of
mending
matters
want
had
never
before
pressed
so
sorely
upon
the
brinker
family
their
stock
of
peat
was
nearly
exhausted
and
all
the
flour
in
the
cottage
was
in
gretel
s
dough
they
had
scarcely
cared
to
eat
during
the
past
few
days
scarcely
realized
their
condition
dame
brinker
had
felt
so
sure
that
she
and
the
children
could
earn
money
before
the
worst
came
that
she
had
given
herself
up
to
the
joy
of
her
husband
s
recovery
she
had
not
even
told
hans
that
the
few
pieces
of
silver
in
the
old
mitten
were
quite
gone
hans
reproached
himself
now
that
he
had
not
hailed
the
doctor
when
he
saw
him
enter
his
coach
and
drive
rapidly
away
in
the
direction
of
amsterdam
perhaps
there
is
some
mistake
he
thought
the
meester
surely
would
have
known
that
meat
and
sweet
wine
were
not
at
our
command
and
yet
the
father
looks
very
weak
he
certainly
does
i
must
get
work
if
mynheer
van
holp
were
back
from
rotterdam
i
could
get
plenty
to
do
but
master
peter
told
me
to
let
him
know
if
he
could
do
aught
to
serve
us
i
shall
go
to
him
at
once
oh
if
it
were
but
summer
all
this
time
hans
was
hastening
toward
the
canal
soon
his
skates
were
on
and
he
was
skimming
rapidly
toward
the
residence
of
mynheer
van
holp
the
father
must
have
meat
and
wine
at
once
he
muttered
but
how
can
i
earn
the
money
in
time
to
buy
them
today
there
is
no
other
way
but
to
go
as
i
promised
to
master
peter
what
would
a
gift
of
meat
and
wine
be
to
him
when
the
father
is
once
fed
i
can
rush
down
to
amsterdam
and
earn
the
morrow
s
then
came
other
thoughts
thoughts
that
made
his
heart
thump
heavily
and
his
cheeks
burn
with
a
new
shame
it
is
begging
to
say
the
least
not
one
of
the
brinkers
has
ever
been
a
beggar
shall
i
be
the
first
shall
my
poor
father
just
coming
back
into
life
learn
that
his
family
has
asked
for
charity
he
always
so
wise
and
thrifty
no
cried
hans
aloud
better
a
thousand
times
to
part
with
the
i
can
at
least
borrow
money
on
it
in
amsterdam
he
thought
turning
around
that
will
be
no
disgrace
i
can
find
work
at
once
and
get
it
back
again
nay
perhaps
i
can
even
speak
to
the
father
about
it
this
last
thought
made
the
lad
dance
for
joy
why
not
indeed
speak
to
the
father
he
was
a
rational
being
now
he
may
wake
thought
hans
quite
bright
and
rested
may
tell
us
the
watch
is
of
no
consequence
to
sell
it
of
course
and
hans
almost
flew
over
the
ice
a
few
moments
more
and
the
skates
were
again
swinging
from
his
arm
he
was
running
toward
the
cottage
his
mother
met
him
at
the
door
oh
hans
she
cried
her
face
radiant
with
joy
the
young
lady
has
been
here
with
her
maid
she
brought
everything
meat
jelly
wine
and
bread
a
whole
basketful
then
the
meester
sent
a
man
from
town
with
more
wine
and
a
fine
bed
and
blankets
for
the
father
oh
he
will
get
well
now
god
bless
them
god
bless
them
echoed
hans
and
for
the
first
time
that
day
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
father
s
return
that
evening
raff
brinker
felt
so
much
better
that
he
insisted
upon
sitting
up
for
a
while
on
the
rough
chair
by
the
fire
for
a
few
moments
there
was
quite
a
commotion
in
the
little
cottage
hans
was
on
the
occasion
for
his
father
was
a
heavy
man
and
needed
something
firm
to
lean
upon
the
dame
though
none
of
your
fragile
ladies
was
in
such
a
state
of
alarm
and
excitement
at
the
bold
step
they
were
taking
in
lifting
him
without
the
meester
s
orders
that
she
came
near
pulling
her
husband
over
even
while
she
believed
herself
to
be
his
main
prop
and
support
steady
vrouw
steady
panted
raff
have
i
grown
old
and
feeble
or
is
it
the
fever
makes
me
thus
helpless
hear
the
man
dame
brinker
laughed
talking
like
any
other
christian
why
you
re
only
weak
from
the
fever
raff
here
s
the
chair
all
fixed
snug
and
warm
now
sit
thee
down
there
we
are
with
these
words
dame
brinker
let
her
half
of
the
burden
settle
slowly
into
the
chair
hans
prudently
did
the
same
meanwhile
gretel
flew
about
generally
bringing
every
possible
thing
to
her
mother
to
tuck
behind
the
father
s
back
and
spread
over
his
knees
then
she
twitched
the
carved
bench
under
his
feet
and
hans
kicked
the
fire
to
make
it
brighter
the
father
was
sitting
up
at
last
what
wonder
that
he
looked
about
him
like
one
bewildered
little
hans
had
just
been
almost
carrying
him
the
baby
was
over
four
feet
long
and
was
demurely
brushing
up
the
hearth
with
a
bundle
of
willow
wisps
meitje
the
vrouw
winsome
and
fair
as
ever
had
gained
at
least
fifty
pounds
in
what
seemed
to
him
a
few
hours
she
also
had
some
new
lines
in
her
face
that
puzzled
him
the
only
familiar
things
in
the
room
were
the
pine
table
that
he
had
made
before
he
was
married
the
bible
upon
the
shelf
and
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
ah
raff
brinker
it
was
only
natural
that
your
eyes
should
fill
with
hot
tears
even
while
looking
at
the
joyful
faces
of
your
loved
ones
ten
years
dropped
from
a
man
s
life
are
no
small
loss
ten
years
of
manhood
of
household
happiness
and
care
ten
years
of
honest
labor
of
conscious
enjoyment
of
sunshine
and
outdoor
beauty
ten
years
of
grateful
life
one
day
looking
forward
to
all
this
the
next
waking
to
find
them
passed
and
a
blank
what
wonder
the
scalding
tears
dropped
one
by
one
upon
your
cheek
tender
little
gretel
the
prayer
of
her
life
was
answered
through
those
tears
she
loved
her
father
silently
at
that
moment
hans
and
his
mother
glanced
silently
at
each
other
when
they
saw
her
spring
toward
him
and
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
father
dear
father
she
whispered
pressing
her
cheek
close
to
his
don
t
cry
we
are
all
god
bless
thee
sobbed
raff
kissing
her
again
and
again
i
had
forgotten
that
soon
he
looked
up
again
and
spoke
in
a
cheerful
voice
i
should
know
her
vrouw
he
said
holding
the
sweet
young
face
between
his
hands
and
gazing
at
it
as
though
he
were
watching
it
grow
i
should
know
her
the
same
blue
eyes
and
the
lips
and
ah
me
the
little
song
she
could
sing
almost
before
she
could
stand
but
that
was
long
ago
he
added
with
a
sigh
still
looking
at
her
dreamily
long
ago
it
s
all
gone
not
so
indeed
cried
dame
brinker
eagerly
do
you
think
i
would
let
her
forget
it
gretel
child
sing
the
old
song
thou
hast
known
so
long
raff
brinker
s
hand
fell
wearily
and
his
eyes
closed
but
it
was
something
to
see
the
smile
playing
about
his
mouth
as
gretel
s
voice
floated
about
him
like
incense
it
was
a
simple
air
she
had
never
known
the
words
with
loving
instinct
she
softened
every
note
until
raff
almost
fancied
that
his
baby
was
once
more
beside
him
as
soon
as
the
song
was
finished
hans
mounted
a
wooden
stool
and
began
to
rummage
in
the
cupboard
have
a
care
hans
said
dame
brinker
who
through
all
her
poverty
was
ever
a
tidy
housewife
have
a
care
the
wine
is
there
at
your
right
and
the
white
bread
beyond
never
fear
mother
answered
hans
reaching
far
back
on
an
upper
shelf
i
shall
do
no
jumping
down
he
walked
toward
his
father
and
placed
an
oblong
block
of
pine
wood
in
his
hands
one
of
its
ends
was
rounded
off
and
some
deep
cuts
had
been
made
on
the
top
do
you
know
what
that
is
father
asked
hans
raff
brinker
s
face
brightened
indeed
i
do
boy
it
is
the
boat
i
was
making
you
yest
alack
not
yesterday
but
years
i
have
kept
it
ever
since
father
it
can
be
finished
when
your
hand
grows
strong
yes
but
not
for
you
my
lad
i
must
wait
for
the
grandchildren
why
you
are
nearly
a
man
have
you
helped
your
mother
through
all
these
years
aye
and
bravely
put
in
dame
brinker
let
me
see
muttered
the
father
looking
in
a
puzzled
way
at
them
all
how
long
is
it
since
the
night
when
the
waters
were
coming
in
tis
the
last
i
we
have
told
thee
true
raff
it
was
ten
years
last
pinxter
ten
years
and
i
fell
then
you
say
has
the
fever
been
on
me
ever
since
dame
brinker
scarcely
knew
how
to
reply
should
she
tell
him
all
tell
him
that
he
had
been
an
idiot
almost
a
lunatic
the
doctor
had
charged
her
on
no
account
to
worry
or
excite
his
patient
hans
and
gretel
looked
astonished
like
enough
raff
she
said
nodding
her
head
and
raising
her
eyebrows
when
a
heavy
man
like
thee
falls
on
his
head
it
s
hard
to
say
what
will
come
but
thou
rt
well
now
raff
thank
the
good
lord
the
newly
awakened
man
bowed
his
head
aye
well
enough
mine
vrouw
he
said
after
a
moment
s
silence
but
my
brain
turns
somehow
like
a
spinning
wheel
it
will
not
be
right
till
i
get
on
the
dikes
again
when
shall
i
be
at
work
think
you
hear
the
man
cried
dame
brinker
delighted
yet
frightened
too
for
that
matter
we
must
get
him
on
the
bed
hans
work
indeed
they
tried
to
raise
him
from
the
chair
but
he
was
not
ready
yet
be
off
with
ye
he
said
with
something
like
his
old
smile
gretel
had
never
seen
it
before
does
a
man
want
to
be
lifted
about
like
a
log
i
tell
you
before
three
suns
i
shall
be
on
the
dikes
again
ah
there
ll
be
some
stout
fellows
to
greet
me
jan
kamphuisen
and
young
hoogsvliet
they
have
been
good
friends
to
thee
hans
i
ll
hans
looked
at
his
mother
young
hoogsvliet
had
been
dead
five
years
jan
kamphuisen
was
in
the
jail
at
amsterdam
aye
they
d
have
done
their
share
no
doubt
said
dame
brinker
parrying
the
inquiry
had
we
asked
them
but
what
with
working
and
studying
hans
has
been
busy
enough
without
seeking
working
and
studying
echoed
raff
in
a
musing
tone
can
the
youngsters
read
and
cipher
meitje
you
should
hear
them
she
answered
proudly
they
can
run
through
a
book
while
i
mop
the
floor
hans
there
is
as
happy
over
a
page
of
big
words
as
a
rabbit
in
a
cabbage
patch
as
for
ciphering
here
lad
help
a
bit
interrupted
raff
brinker
i
must
get
me
on
the
bed
the
thousand
guilders
none
seeing
the
humble
supper
eaten
in
the
brinker
cottage
that
night
would
have
dreamed
of
the
dainty
repast
hidden
away
nearby
hans
and
gretel
looked
rather
wistfully
toward
the
cupboard
as
they
drank
their
cupful
of
water
and
ate
their
scanty
share
of
black
bread
but
even
in
thought
they
did
not
rob
their
father
he
relished
his
supper
well
said
dame
brinker
nodding
sidewise
toward
the
bed
and
fell
asleep
the
next
moment
ah
the
dear
man
will
be
feeble
for
many
a
day
he
wanted
sore
to
sit
up
again
but
while
i
made
show
of
humoring
him
and
getting
ready
he
dropped
off
remember
that
my
girl
when
you
have
a
man
of
your
own
and
many
a
day
may
it
be
before
that
comes
to
pass
remember
that
you
can
never
rule
by
differing
humble
wife
is
husband
s
tut
tut
never
swallow
such
a
mouthful
as
that
again
child
why
i
could
make
a
meal
off
two
such
pieces
what
s
in
thee
hans
one
would
think
there
were
cobwebs
on
the
oh
no
mother
i
was
only
thinking
thinking
about
what
ah
no
use
asking
she
added
in
a
changed
tone
i
was
thinking
of
the
same
a
while
ago
well
it
s
no
blame
if
we
did
look
to
hear
something
by
this
time
about
the
thousand
guilders
but
not
a
word
no
it
s
plain
enough
he
knows
naught
about
hans
looked
up
anxiously
dreading
lest
his
mother
should
grow
agitated
as
usual
when
speaking
of
the
lost
money
but
she
was
silently
nibbling
her
bread
and
looking
with
a
doleful
stare
toward
the
window
thousand
guilders
echoed
a
faint
voice
from
the
bed
ah
i
am
sure
they
have
been
of
good
use
to
you
vrouw
through
the
long
years
when
your
man
was
the
poor
woman
started
up
these
words
quite
destroyed
the
hope
that
of
late
had
been
glowing
within
her
are
you
awake
raff
she
faltered
yes
meitje
and
i
feel
much
better
our
money
was
well
saved
vrouw
i
was
saying
did
it
last
through
all
those
ten
years
i
i
have
not
got
it
raff
i
she
was
going
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
when
hans
lifted
his
finger
warningly
and
whispered
remember
what
the
meester
told
us
the
father
must
not
be
speak
to
him
child
she
answered
trembling
hans
hurried
to
the
bedside
i
am
glad
you
are
feeling
better
he
said
leaning
over
his
father
another
day
will
see
you
quite
strong
aye
like
enough
how
long
did
the
money
last
hans
i
could
not
hear
your
mother
what
did
she
say
i
said
raff
stammered
dame
brinker
in
great
distress
that
it
was
all
well
well
wife
do
not
fret
at
that
one
thousand
guilders
is
not
so
very
much
for
ten
years
and
with
children
to
bring
up
but
it
has
helped
to
make
you
all
comfortable
have
you
had
much
sickness
to
bear
no
no
sobbed
dame
brinker
lifting
her
apron
to
her
eyes
tut
tut
woman
why
do
you
cry
said
raff
kindly
we
will
soon
fill
another
pouch
when
i
am
on
my
feet
again
lucky
i
told
you
all
about
it
before
i
told
me
what
man
why
that
i
buried
the
money
in
my
dream
just
now
it
seemed
that
i
had
never
said
aught
about
dame
brinker
started
forward
hans
caught
her
arm
hist
mother
he
whispered
hastily
leading
her
away
we
must
be
very
then
while
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
waiting
in
breathless
anxiety
he
once
more
approached
the
cot
trembling
with
eagerness
he
said
that
was
a
troublesome
dream
do
you
remember
when
you
buried
the
money
father
yes
my
boy
it
was
just
before
daylight
on
the
same
day
i
was
hurt
jan
kamphuisen
said
something
the
sundown
before
that
made
me
distrust
his
honesty
he
was
the
only
one
living
besides
mother
who
knew
that
we
had
saved
a
thousand
guilders
so
i
rose
up
that
night
and
buried
the
money
blockhead
that
i
was
ever
to
suspect
an
old
friend
i
ll
be
bound
father
pursued
hans
in
a
laughing
voice
motioning
to
his
mother
and
gretel
to
remain
quiet
that
you
ve
forgotten
where
you
buried
ha
ha
not
i
indeed
but
good
night
my
son
i
can
sleep
hans
would
have
walked
away
but
his
mother
s
gestures
were
not
to
be
disobeyed
so
he
said
gently
good
night
father
where
did
you
say
you
buried
the
money
i
was
only
a
little
one
close
by
the
willow
sapling
behind
the
cottage
said
raff
brinker
drowsily
ah
yes
north
side
of
the
tree
wasn
t
it
father
no
the
south
side
ah
you
know
the
spot
well
enough
you
rogue
like
enough
you
were
there
when
your
mother
lifted
it
now
son
easy
shift
this
pillow
so
good
good
night
father
said
hans
ready
to
dance
for
joy
the
moon
rose
very
late
that
night
shining
in
full
and
clear
at
the
little
window
but
its
beams
did
not
disturb
raff
brinker
he
slept
soundly
so
did
gretel
as
for
hans
and
his
mother
they
had
something
else
to
do
after
making
a
few
hurried
preparations
they
stole
forth
with
bright
expectant
faces
bearing
a
broken
spade
and
a
rusty
implement
that
had
done
many
a
day
s
service
when
raff
was
a
hale
worker
on
the
dikes
it
was
so
light
out
of
doors
that
they
could
see
the
willow
tree
distinctly
the
frozen
ground
was
hard
as
stone
but
hans
and
his
mother
were
resolute
their
only
dread
was
that
they
might
disturb
the
sleepers
in
the
cottage
this
ysbreeker
is
just
the
thing
mother
said
hans
striking
many
a
vigorous
blow
but
the
ground
has
set
so
firm
it
ll
be
a
fair
match
for
never
fear
hans
she
answered
watching
him
eagerly
here
let
me
try
they
soon
succeeded
in
making
an
impression
one
opening
and
the
rest
was
not
so
difficult
still
they
worked
on
taking
turns
and
whispering
cheerily
to
one
another
now
and
then
dame
brinker
stepped
noiselessly
over
the
threshold
and
listened
to
be
certain
that
her
husband
slept
what
grand
news
it
will
be
for
him
she
said
laughing
when
he
is
strong
enough
to
bear
it
how
i
should
like
to
put
the
pouch
and
the
stocking
just
as
we
find
them
all
full
of
money
near
him
this
blessed
night
for
the
dear
man
to
see
when
he
we
must
get
them
first
mother
panted
hans
still
tugging
away
at
his
work
there
s
no
doubt
of
that
they
can
t
slip
away
from
us
now
she
answered
shivering
with
cold
and
excitement
as
she
crouched
beside
the
opening
like
enough
we
ll
find
them
stowed
in
the
old
earthen
pot
i
lost
long
by
this
time
hans
too
began
to
tremble
but
not
with
cold
he
had
penetrated
a
foot
deep
for
quite
a
space
on
the
south
side
of
the
tree
at
any
moment
they
might
come
upon
the
treasure
meantime
the
stars
winked
and
blinked
at
each
other
as
if
to
say
queer
country
this
holland
how
much
we
do
see
to
be
sure
strange
that
the
dear
father
should
have
put
it
down
so
woeful
deep
said
dame
brinker
in
rather
a
provoked
tone
ah
the
ground
was
soft
enough
then
i
warrant
how
wise
of
him
to
mistrust
jan
kamphuisen
and
jan
in
full
credit
at
the
time
little
i
thought
that
handsome
fellow
with
his
gay
ways
would
ever
go
to
jail
now
hans
let
me
take
a
turn
it
s
lighter
work
d
ye
see
the
deeper
we
go
i
d
be
loath
to
kill
the
tree
hans
will
we
harm
it
do
you
think
i
can
not
say
he
answered
gravely
hour
after
hour
mother
and
son
worked
on
the
hole
grew
larger
and
deeper
clouds
began
to
gather
in
the
sky
throwing
elfish
shadows
as
they
passed
not
until
moon
and
stars
faded
away
and
streaks
of
daylight
began
to
appear
did
meitje
brinker
and
hans
look
hopelessly
into
each
other
s
faces
they
had
searched
the
ground
thoroughly
desperately
all
round
the
tree
south
north
east
west
the
hidden
money
was
not
there
glimpses
annie
bouman
had
a
healthy
distaste
for
janzoon
kolp
janzoon
kolp
in
his
own
rough
way
adored
annie
annie
declared
that
she
could
not
to
save
her
life
say
one
civil
word
to
that
odious
boy
janzoon
believed
her
to
be
the
sweetest
sauciest
creature
in
the
world
annie
laughed
among
her
playmates
at
the
comical
flapping
of
janzoon
s
tattered
and
dingy
jacket
he
sighed
in
solitude
over
the
floating
grace
of
her
jaunty
blue
petticoat
she
thanked
her
stars
that
her
brothers
were
not
like
the
kolps
and
he
growled
at
his
sister
because
she
was
not
like
the
boumans
his
presence
made
her
harsh
and
unfeeling
and
the
very
sight
of
her
made
him
gentle
as
a
lamb
of
course
they
were
thrown
together
very
often
it
is
thus
that
in
some
mysterious
way
we
are
convinced
of
error
and
cured
of
prejudice
in
this
case
however
the
scheme
failed
annie
detested
janzoon
more
and
more
at
each
encounter
and
janzoon
liked
her
better
and
better
every
day
he
killed
a
stork
the
wicked
old
wretch
she
would
say
to
herself
she
knows
i
am
strong
and
fearless
thought
janzoon
how
red
and
freckled
and
ugly
he
is
was
annie
s
secret
comment
when
she
looked
at
him
how
she
stares
and
stares
thought
janzoon
well
i
am
a
fine
fellow
anyway
janzoon
kolp
you
impudent
boy
go
right
away
from
me
annie
often
said
i
don
t
want
any
of
your
ha
ha
laughed
janzoon
to
himself
girls
never
say
what
they
mean
i
ll
skate
with
her
every
chance
i
can
get
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
pretty
maid
would
not
look
up
that
morning
when
skating
homeward
from
amsterdam
she
became
convinced
that
a
great
burly
boy
was
coming
down
the
canal
toward
her
humph
if
i
look
at
him
thought
annie
i
ll
good
morrow
annie
bouman
said
a
pleasant
voice
how
a
smile
brightens
a
girl
s
face
good
morrow
master
hans
i
am
right
glad
to
meet
how
a
smile
brightens
a
boy
s
face
good
morrow
again
annie
there
has
been
a
great
change
at
our
house
since
you
how
so
she
exclaimed
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
hans
who
had
been
in
a
great
hurry
and
rather
moody
grew
talkative
and
quite
at
leisure
in
annie
s
sunshine
turning
about
and
skating
slowly
with
her
toward
broek
he
told
the
good
news
of
his
father
annie
was
so
true
a
friend
that
he
told
her
even
of
their
present
distress
of
how
money
was
needed
and
how
everything
depended
upon
his
obtaining
work
and
he
could
find
nothing
to
do
in
the
neighborhood
all
this
was
not
said
as
a
complaint
but
just
because
she
was
looking
at
him
and
really
wished
to
know
he
could
not
speak
of
last
night
s
bitter
disappointment
for
that
secret
was
not
wholly
his
own
annie
he
said
at
last
the
morning
is
going
fast
and
i
must
haste
to
amsterdam
and
sell
these
skates
mother
must
have
money
at
once
before
nightfall
i
shall
certainly
find
a
job
sell
your
new
skates
hans
cried
annie
you
the
best
skater
around
broek
why
the
race
is
coming
off
in
five
days
i
know
it
he
answered
resolutely
i
shall
skate
home
again
on
the
old
wooden
such
a
bright
glance
so
different
from
janzoon
s
ugly
grin
and
hans
was
off
like
an
arrow
hans
come
back
she
called
her
voice
changed
the
arrow
into
a
top
spinning
around
he
darted
in
one
long
leaning
sweep
toward
her
then
you
really
are
going
to
sell
your
new
skates
if
you
can
find
a
customer
well
hans
if
you
are
going
to
sell
your
skates
said
annie
quite
confused
i
mean
if
you
well
i
know
somebody
who
would
like
to
buy
them
that
s
not
janzoon
kolp
asked
hans
flushing
oh
no
she
said
pouting
he
is
not
one
of
my
but
you
know
him
persisted
hans
annie
laughed
yes
i
know
him
and
it
s
all
the
worse
for
him
that
i
do
now
please
hans
don
t
ever
talk
any
more
to
me
about
janzoon
i
hate
him
hate
him
you
hate
anybody
annie
she
shook
her
head
saucily
yes
and
i
ll
hate
you
too
if
you
persist
in
calling
him
one
of
my
friends
you
boys
may
like
him
because
he
caught
the
greased
goose
at
the
kermis
last
summer
and
climbed
the
pole
with
his
great
ugly
body
tied
up
in
a
sack
but
i
don
t
care
for
such
things
i
ve
disliked
him
ever
since
i
saw
him
try
to
push
his
little
sister
out
of
the
at
amsterdam
and
it
s
no
secret
up
our
way
who
killed
the
stork
on
your
mother
s
roof
but
we
mustn
t
talk
about
such
a
bad
wicked
fellow
really
hans
i
know
somebody
who
would
be
glad
to
buy
your
skates
you
won
t
get
half
a
price
for
them
in
amsterdam
please
give
them
to
me
i
ll
take
you
the
money
this
very
if
annie
was
charming
even
when
she
said
hate
there
was
no
withstanding
her
when
she
said
please
at
least
hans
found
it
to
be
so
annie
he
said
taking
off
the
skates
and
rubbing
them
carefully
with
a
snarl
of
twine
before
handing
them
to
her
i
am
sorry
to
be
so
particular
but
if
your
friend
should
not
want
them
will
you
bring
them
back
to
me
today
i
must
buy
peat
and
meal
for
the
mother
early
tomorrow
my
friend
will
want
them
annie
laughed
nodding
gaily
and
skated
off
at
the
top
of
her
speed
as
hans
drew
forth
the
wooden
runners
from
his
capricious
pockets
and
fastened
them
on
as
best
he
could
he
did
not
hear
annie
murmur
i
wish
i
had
not
been
so
rude
poor
brave
hans
what
a
noble
boy
he
is
and
as
annie
skated
homeward
filled
with
pleasant
thoughts
she
did
not
hear
hans
say
i
grumbled
like
a
bear
but
bless
her
some
girls
are
like
angels
perhaps
it
was
all
for
the
best
one
can
not
be
expected
to
know
everything
that
is
going
on
around
the
world
looking
for
work
luxuries
unfit
us
for
returning
to
hardships
easily
endured
before
the
wooden
runners
squeaked
more
than
ever
it
was
as
much
as
hans
could
do
to
get
on
with
the
clumsy
old
things
still
he
did
not
regret
that
he
had
parted
with
his
beautiful
skates
but
resolutely
pushed
back
the
boyish
trouble
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
them
just
a
little
longer
at
least
until
after
the
race
mother
surely
will
not
be
angry
with
me
he
thought
for
selling
them
without
her
leave
she
has
had
care
enough
already
it
will
be
full
time
to
speak
of
it
when
i
take
home
the
money
hans
went
up
and
down
the
streets
of
amsterdam
that
day
looking
for
work
he
succeeded
in
earning
a
few
stivers
by
assisting
a
man
who
was
driving
a
train
of
loaded
mules
into
the
city
but
he
could
not
secure
steady
employment
anywhere
he
would
have
been
glad
to
obtain
a
situation
as
porter
or
errand
boy
but
though
he
passed
on
his
way
many
a
loitering
shuffling
urchin
laden
with
bundles
there
was
no
place
for
him
some
shopkeepers
had
just
supplied
themselves
others
needed
a
trimmer
more
lightly
built
fellow
they
meant
better
dressed
but
did
not
choose
to
say
so
others
told
him
to
call
again
in
a
month
or
two
when
the
canals
would
probably
be
broken
up
and
many
shook
their
heads
at
him
without
saying
a
word
at
the
factories
he
met
with
no
better
luck
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
those
great
buildings
turning
out
respectively
such
tremendous
quantities
of
woolen
cotton
and
linen
stuffs
such
dyes
and
paints
such
precious
diamonds
cut
from
the
rough
such
supplies
of
meal
of
bricks
of
glass
and
china
that
in
at
least
one
of
these
a
boy
able
and
eager
to
work
could
find
something
to
do
but
no
nearly
the
same
answer
met
him
everywhere
no
need
of
more
hands
just
now
if
he
had
called
before
saint
nicholas
s
day
they
might
have
given
him
a
job
as
they
were
hurried
then
but
at
present
they
had
more
boys
than
they
needed
hans
wished
they
could
see
just
for
a
moment
his
mother
and
gretel
he
did
not
know
how
the
anxiety
of
both
looked
out
from
his
eyes
and
how
more
than
once
the
gruffest
denials
were
uttered
with
an
uncomfortable
consciousness
that
the
lad
ought
not
be
turned
away
certain
fathers
when
they
went
home
that
night
spoke
more
kindly
than
usual
to
their
youngsters
from
memory
of
a
frank
young
face
saddened
at
their
words
and
before
morning
one
man
actually
resolved
that
he
would
instruct
his
head
man
blankert
to
set
the
boy
from
broek
at
something
if
he
should
come
in
again
but
hans
knew
nothing
of
all
this
toward
sundown
he
started
on
his
return
to
broek
uncertain
whether
the
strange
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
arose
from
discouragement
or
resolution
there
was
certainly
one
more
chance
mynheer
van
holp
might
have
returned
by
this
time
master
peter
it
was
reported
had
gone
to
haarlem
the
night
before
to
attend
to
something
connected
with
the
great
skating
race
still
hans
would
go
and
try
fortunately
peter
had
returned
early
that
morning
he
was
at
home
when
hans
reached
there
and
was
just
about
starting
for
the
brinker
cottage
ah
hans
he
cried
as
the
weary
boy
approached
the
door
you
are
the
very
one
i
wished
to
see
you
are
the
very
one
i
wished
to
see
come
in
and
warm
after
tugging
at
his
hat
which
always
would
stick
to
his
head
when
he
was
embarrassed
hans
knelt
down
not
by
way
of
making
a
new
style
of
oriental
salute
nor
to
worship
the
goddess
of
cleanliness
who
presided
there
but
because
his
heavy
shoes
would
have
filled
the
soul
of
a
broek
housewife
with
horror
when
their
owner
stepped
softly
into
the
house
they
were
left
outside
to
act
as
sentinels
until
his
return
hans
left
the
van
holp
mansion
with
a
lightened
heart
peter
had
brought
word
from
haarlem
that
young
brinker
was
to
commence
working
upon
the
doors
immediately
there
was
a
comfortable
workshop
on
the
place
and
it
was
to
be
at
his
service
until
the
carving
was
done
peter
did
not
tell
him
that
he
had
skated
all
the
way
to
haarlem
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
this
plan
with
mynheer
van
holp
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
the
glad
eager
look
rise
on
young
brinker
s
face
i
think
i
can
do
it
said
hans
though
i
have
never
learned
the
i
am
sure
you
can
responded
peter
heartily
you
will
find
every
tool
you
require
in
the
workshop
it
is
nearly
hidden
yonder
by
that
wall
of
twigs
in
summer
when
the
hedge
is
green
one
can
not
see
the
shop
from
here
at
all
how
is
your
father
today
better
mynheer
he
improves
every
it
is
the
most
astonishing
thing
i
ever
heard
of
that
gruff
old
doctor
is
a
great
fellow
after
ah
mynheer
said
hans
warmly
he
is
more
than
great
he
is
good
but
for
the
meester
s
kind
heart
and
great
skill
my
poor
father
would
yet
be
in
the
dark
i
think
mynheer
he
added
with
kindling
eyes
surgery
is
the
very
noblest
science
in
the
world
peter
shrugged
his
shoulders
very
noble
it
may
be
but
not
quite
to
my
taste
this
boekman
certainly
has
skill
as
for
his
heart
defend
me
from
such
hearts
as
his
why
do
you
say
so
mynheer
asked
hans
just
then
a
lady
slowly
entered
from
an
adjoining
apartment
it
was
mevrouw
van
holp
arrayed
in
the
grandest
of
caps
and
the
longest
of
satin
aprons
ruffled
with
lace
she
nodded
placidly
as
hans
stepped
back
from
the
fire
bowing
as
well
as
he
knew
how
peter
at
once
drew
a
oaken
chair
toward
the
fire
and
the
lady
seated
herself
there
was
a
block
of
cork
on
each
side
of
the
chimney
place
one
of
these
he
placed
under
his
mother
s
feet
hans
turned
to
go
wait
a
moment
if
you
please
young
man
said
the
lady
i
accidentally
overheard
you
and
my
son
speaking
i
think
of
my
friend
boekman
you
are
right
young
man
boekman
has
a
very
kind
heart
you
perceive
peter
that
we
may
be
quite
mistaken
in
judging
a
person
solely
by
his
manners
though
a
courteous
deportment
is
by
no
means
to
be
i
intended
no
disrespect
mother
said
peter
but
surely
one
has
no
right
to
go
growling
and
snarling
through
the
world
as
they
say
he
they
say
ah
peter
they
means
everybody
or
nobody
surgeon
boekman
has
had
a
great
sorrow
many
years
ago
he
lost
his
only
child
under
very
painful
circumstances
a
fine
lad
except
that
he
was
a
thought
too
hasty
and
before
then
gerard
boekman
was
one
of
the
most
agreeable
gentlemen
i
ever
so
saying
mevrouw
van
holp
looking
kindly
upon
the
two
boys
rose
and
left
the
room
with
the
same
dignity
with
which
she
had
entered
peter
only
half
convinced
muttered
something
about
the
sin
of
allowing
sorrow
to
turn
all
one
s
honey
into
gall
as
he
conducted
his
visitor
to
the
narrow
side
door
before
they
parted
he
advised
hans
to
keep
himself
in
good
skating
order
for
he
added
now
that
your
father
is
all
right
you
will
be
in
fine
spirits
for
the
race
that
will
be
the
prettiest
skating
show
ever
seen
in
this
part
of
the
world
everybody
is
talking
of
it
you
are
to
try
for
the
prize
i
shall
not
be
in
the
race
mynheer
said
hans
looking
down
not
in
the
race
why
not
indeed
and
immediately
peter
s
thoughts
swept
on
a
full
tide
of
suspicion
toward
carl
schummel
because
i
can
not
mynheer
answered
hans
as
he
bent
to
slip
his
feet
into
his
big
shoes
something
in
the
boy
s
manner
warned
peter
that
it
would
be
no
kindness
to
press
the
matter
further
he
bade
hans
and
stood
thoughtfully
watching
him
as
he
walked
away
in
a
minute
peter
called
out
hans
brinker
yes
i
ll
take
back
all
i
said
about
yes
both
were
laughing
but
peter
s
smile
changed
to
a
look
of
puzzled
surprise
when
he
saw
hans
kneel
down
by
the
canal
and
put
on
the
wooden
skates
very
queer
muttered
peter
shaking
his
head
as
he
turned
to
go
into
the
house
why
in
the
world
doesn
t
the
boy
wear
his
new
ones
the
fairy
godmother
the
sun
had
gone
down
quite
out
of
sight
when
our
hero
with
a
happy
heart
but
with
something
like
a
sneer
on
his
countenance
as
he
jerked
off
the
wooden
runners
trudged
hopefully
toward
the
tiny
hutlike
building
known
of
old
as
the
idiot
s
duller
eyes
than
his
would
have
discerned
two
slight
figures
moving
near
the
doorway
that
gray
jacket
and
the
dull
blue
skirt
covered
with
an
apron
of
still
duller
blue
that
faded
cap
and
those
quick
little
feet
in
their
great
boatlike
shoes
they
were
gretel
s
of
course
he
would
have
known
them
anywhere
that
bright
coquettish
red
jacket
with
its
pretty
skirt
bordered
with
black
that
graceful
cap
bobbing
over
the
gold
earrings
that
dainty
apron
and
those
snug
leather
shoes
that
seemed
to
have
grown
with
the
feet
why
if
the
pope
of
rome
had
sent
them
to
him
by
express
hans
could
have
sworn
they
were
annie
s
the
two
girls
were
slowly
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
cottage
their
arms
were
entwined
of
course
and
their
heads
were
nodding
and
shaking
as
emphatically
as
if
all
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
were
under
discussion
with
a
joyous
shout
hans
hastened
toward
them
huzza
girls
i
ve
found
work
this
brought
his
mother
to
the
cottage
door
she
too
had
pleasant
tidings
the
father
was
still
improving
he
had
been
sitting
up
nearly
all
day
and
was
now
sleeping
as
dame
brinker
declared
just
as
quiet
as
a
it
is
my
turn
now
hans
said
annie
drawing
him
aside
after
he
had
told
his
mother
the
good
word
from
mynheer
van
holp
your
skates
are
sold
and
here
s
the
seven
guilders
cried
hans
counting
the
pieces
in
astonishment
why
that
is
three
times
as
much
as
i
paid
for
i
can
not
help
that
said
annie
if
the
buyer
knew
no
better
that
is
not
our
hans
looked
up
quickly
oh
annie
oh
hans
she
mimicked
pursing
her
lips
and
trying
to
look
desperately
wicked
and
unprincipled
now
annie
i
know
you
would
never
mean
that
you
must
return
some
of
this
but
i
ll
not
do
any
such
thing
insisted
annie
they
re
sold
and
that
s
an
end
of
then
seeing
that
he
looked
really
pained
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
will
you
believe
me
hans
when
i
say
that
there
has
been
no
mistake
that
the
person
who
bought
your
skates
insisted
upon
paying
seven
guilders
for
them
i
will
he
answered
and
the
light
from
his
clear
blue
eyes
seemed
to
settle
and
sparkle
under
annie
s
lashes
dame
brinker
was
delighted
at
the
sight
of
so
much
silver
but
when
she
learned
that
hans
had
parted
with
his
treasures
to
obtain
it
she
sighed
and
then
exclaimed
bless
thee
child
that
will
be
a
sore
loss
for
thee
here
mother
said
the
boy
plunging
his
hands
far
into
his
pocket
here
is
more
we
shall
be
rich
if
we
keep
on
aye
indeed
she
answered
eagerly
reaching
forth
her
hand
then
lowering
her
voice
added
we
should
be
rich
but
for
that
jan
kamphuisen
he
was
at
the
willow
tree
years
ago
hans
depend
upon
it
indeed
it
seems
likely
sighed
hans
well
mother
we
must
give
up
the
money
bravely
it
is
certainly
gone
the
father
has
told
us
all
he
knows
let
us
think
no
more
about
that
s
easy
saying
hans
i
shall
try
but
it
s
hard
and
my
poor
man
wanting
so
many
comforts
bless
me
how
girls
fly
about
they
were
here
but
this
instant
where
did
they
run
to
they
slipped
behind
the
cottage
said
hans
like
enough
to
hide
from
us
hist
i
ll
catch
them
for
you
they
both
can
move
quicker
and
softer
than
yonder
rabbit
but
i
ll
give
them
a
good
start
why
there
is
a
rabbit
sure
enough
hold
hans
the
poor
thing
must
have
been
in
sore
need
to
venture
from
its
burrow
in
this
bitter
weather
i
ll
get
a
few
crumbs
for
it
so
saying
the
good
woman
bustled
into
the
cottage
she
soon
came
out
again
but
hans
had
forgotten
to
wait
and
the
rabbit
after
taking
a
cool
survey
of
the
premises
had
scampered
off
to
unknown
quarters
turning
the
corner
of
the
cottage
dame
brinker
came
upon
the
children
hans
and
gretel
were
standing
before
annie
who
was
seated
carelessly
upon
a
stump
that
is
as
good
as
a
picture
cried
dame
brinker
halting
in
admiration
of
the
group
many
a
painting
have
i
seen
at
the
grand
house
at
heidelberg
not
a
whit
prettier
my
two
are
rough
chubs
annie
but
you
look
like
a
do
i
laughed
annie
sparkling
with
animation
well
then
gretel
and
hans
imagine
i
m
your
godmother
just
paying
you
a
visit
now
i
ll
grant
you
each
a
wish
what
will
you
have
master
hans
a
shade
of
earnestness
passed
over
annie
s
face
as
she
looked
up
at
him
perhaps
it
was
because
she
wished
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
that
for
once
she
could
have
a
fairy
s
power
something
whispered
to
hans
that
for
a
moment
she
was
more
than
mortal
i
wish
said
he
solemnly
that
i
could
find
something
i
was
searching
for
last
night
gretel
laughed
merrily
dame
brinker
moaned
shame
on
you
hans
and
she
went
wearily
into
the
cottage
the
fairy
godmother
sprang
up
and
stamped
her
foot
three
times
thou
shalt
have
thy
wish
said
she
let
them
say
what
they
then
with
playful
solemnity
she
put
her
hand
in
her
apron
pocket
and
drew
forth
a
large
glass
bead
bury
this
said
she
giving
it
to
hans
where
i
have
stamped
and
ere
moonrise
thy
wish
shall
be
gretel
laughed
more
merrily
than
ever
the
godmother
pretended
great
displeasure
naughty
child
said
she
scowling
terribly
in
punishment
for
laughing
at
a
fairy
thy
wish
shall
not
be
ha
cried
gretel
in
high
glee
better
wait
till
you
re
asked
godmother
i
haven
t
made
any
wish
annie
acted
her
part
well
never
smiling
through
all
their
merry
laughter
she
stalked
away
the
embodiment
of
offended
dignity
good
night
fairy
they
cried
again
and
again
good
night
mortals
she
called
out
at
last
as
she
sprang
over
a
frozen
ditch
and
ran
quickly
homeward
oh
isn
t
she
just
like
flowers
so
sweet
and
lovely
cried
gretel
looking
after
her
in
great
admiration
and
to
think
how
many
days
she
stays
in
that
dark
room
with
her
grandmother
why
brother
hans
what
is
the
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
wait
and
see
answered
hans
as
he
plunged
into
the
cottage
and
came
out
again
all
in
an
instant
bearing
the
spade
and
ysbreeker
in
his
hands
i
m
going
to
bury
my
magic
bead
raff
brinker
still
slept
soundly
his
wife
took
a
small
block
of
peat
from
her
nearly
exhausted
store
and
put
it
upon
the
embers
then
opening
the
door
she
called
gently
come
in
mother
mother
see
here
shouted
hans
holy
saint
bavon
exclaimed
the
dame
springing
over
the
doorstep
what
ails
the
boy
come
quick
mother
he
cried
in
great
excitement
working
with
all
his
might
and
driving
in
the
ysbreeker
at
each
word
don
t
you
see
this
is
the
spot
right
here
on
the
south
side
of
the
stump
why
didn
t
we
think
of
it
last
night
the
stump
is
the
old
willow
tree
the
one
you
cut
down
last
spring
because
it
shaded
the
potatoes
that
little
tree
wasn
t
here
when
father
huzza
dame
brinker
could
not
speak
she
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
hans
just
in
time
to
see
him
drag
forth
the
old
stone
pot
he
thrust
in
his
hand
and
took
out
a
piece
of
brick
then
another
then
another
then
the
stocking
and
the
pouch
black
and
moldy
but
filled
with
the
treasure
such
a
time
such
laughing
such
crying
such
counting
after
they
went
into
the
cottage
it
was
a
wonder
that
raff
did
not
waken
his
dreams
were
pleasant
however
for
he
smiled
in
his
sleep
dame
brinker
and
her
children
had
a
fine
supper
i
can
assure
you
no
need
of
saving
the
delicacies
now
we
ll
get
father
some
nice
fresh
things
tomorrow
dame
brinker
said
as
she
brought
forth
cold
meat
wine
bread
and
jelly
and
placed
them
on
the
clean
pine
table
sit
by
children
sit
that
night
annie
fell
asleep
wondering
whether
it
was
a
knife
hans
had
lost
and
thinking
how
funny
it
would
be
if
he
should
find
it
after
all
hans
had
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
before
he
found
himself
trudging
along
a
thicket
pots
of
gold
were
lying
all
around
and
watches
and
skates
and
glittering
beads
were
swinging
from
every
branch
strange
to
say
each
tree
as
he
approached
it
changed
into
a
stump
and
on
the
stump
sat
the
prettiest
fairy
imaginable
clad
in
a
scarlet
jacket
and
a
blue
petticoat
the
mysterious
watch
something
else
than
the
missing
guilders
was
brought
to
light
on
the
day
of
the
fairy
godmother
s
visit
this
was
the
story
of
the
watch
that
for
ten
long
years
had
been
so
jealously
guarded
by
raff
s
faithful
vrouw
through
many
an
hour
of
sore
temptation
she
had
dreaded
almost
to
look
upon
it
lest
she
might
be
tempted
to
disobey
her
husband
s
request
it
had
been
hard
to
see
her
children
hungry
and
to
know
that
the
watch
if
sold
would
enable
the
roses
to
bloom
in
their
cheeks
again
but
nay
she
would
exclaim
meitje
brinker
is
not
one
to
forget
her
man
s
last
bidding
come
what
take
good
care
of
this
mine
vrouw
he
had
said
as
he
handed
it
to
her
that
was
all
no
explanation
followed
for
the
words
were
scarcely
spoken
when
one
of
his
fellow
workmen
rushed
into
the
cottage
crying
come
man
the
waters
are
rising
you
re
wanted
on
the
raff
had
started
at
once
and
that
was
the
last
dame
brinker
saw
of
him
in
his
right
mind
on
the
day
when
hans
was
in
amsterdam
looking
for
work
and
gretel
after
performing
her
household
labors
was
wandering
in
search
of
chips
twigs
anything
that
could
be
burned
dame
brinker
with
suppressed
excitement
had
laid
the
watch
in
her
husband
s
hand
it
wasn
t
in
reason
as
she
afterward
said
to
hans
to
wait
any
longer
when
a
word
from
the
father
would
settle
all
no
woman
living
but
would
want
to
know
how
he
came
by
that
raff
brinker
turned
the
bright
polished
thing
over
and
over
in
his
hand
then
he
examined
the
bit
of
smoothly
ironed
black
ribbon
fastened
to
it
he
seemed
hardly
to
recognize
it
at
last
he
said
ah
i
remember
this
why
you
ve
been
rubbing
it
vrouw
till
it
shines
like
a
new
aye
said
dame
brinker
nodding
her
head
complacently
raff
looked
at
it
again
poor
boy
he
murmured
then
fell
into
a
brown
study
this
was
too
much
for
the
dame
poor
boy
she
echoed
somewhat
tartly
what
do
you
think
i
m
standing
here
for
raff
brinker
and
my
spinning
awaiting
if
not
to
hear
more
than
that
i
told
ye
all
long
since
said
raff
positively
as
he
looked
up
in
surprise
indeed
and
you
never
did
retorted
the
vrouw
well
if
not
since
it
s
no
affair
of
ours
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
said
raff
shaking
his
head
sadly
like
enough
while
i
ve
been
dead
on
the
earth
all
this
time
the
poor
boy
s
died
and
been
in
heaven
he
looked
near
enough
to
it
poor
lad
raff
brinker
if
you
re
going
to
treat
me
this
way
and
i
nursing
you
and
bearing
with
you
since
i
was
years
old
it
s
a
shame
aye
and
a
disgrace
cried
the
vrouw
growing
quite
red
and
scant
of
breath
raff
s
voice
was
feeble
yet
treat
you
what
way
meitje
what
way
said
dame
brinker
mimicking
his
voice
and
manner
what
way
why
just
as
every
woman
in
the
world
is
treated
after
she
s
stood
by
a
man
through
the
worst
like
a
meitje
raff
was
leaning
forward
with
outstretched
arms
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
in
an
instant
dame
brinker
was
at
his
feet
clasping
his
hands
in
hers

good

and

me
four
days

own
boy

m
sorry

hard

about

waiting
ten
years
to
know
but
i
ll
ask
thee
no
more
raff
here

ll
put
the
thing
away
that

made
the
first
trouble
between
us
after
god
just
gave
thee
back
to
i
was
a
fool
to
cry
meitje
he
said
kissing
her
and
it
s
no
more
than
right
that
ye
should
know
the
truth
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
be
telling
the
secrets
of
the
dead
to
talk
about
the
is
the
man
the
lad
thou
wert
talking
of
dead
think
thee
asked
the
vrouw
hiding
the
watch
in
her
hand
but
seating
herself
expectantly
on
the
end
of
his
long
foot
bench
it
s
hard
telling
he
answered
was
he
so
sick
raff
no
not
sick
i
may
say
but
troubled
vrouw
very
had
he
done
wrong
think
ye
she
asked
lowering
her
voice
raff
nodded
murder
whispered
the
wife
not
daring
to
look
up
he
said
it
was
like
to
that
oh
raff
you
frighten
me
tell
me
more
you
speak
so
strange
and
you
tremble
i
must
know
if
i
tremble
mine
vrouw
it
must
be
from
the
fever
there
is
no
guilt
on
my
soul
thank
god
take
a
sip
of
this
wine
raff
there
now
you
are
better
it
was
like
to
a
crime
you
were
aye
meitje
like
to
murder
that
he
told
me
himself
but
i
ll
never
believe
it
a
likely
lad
fresh
and
as
our
own
youngster
but
with
something
not
so
bold
and
straight
about
aye
i
know
said
the
dame
gently
fearing
to
interrupt
the
story
he
came
upon
me
quite
suddenly
continued
raff
i
had
never
seen
his
face
before
the
palest
frightenedest
face
that
ever
was
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
you
look
like
an
honest
man
says
aye
he
was
right
in
that
interrupted
the
dame
emphatically
raff
looked
somewhat
bewildered
where
was
i
mine
vrouw
the
lad
took
hold
of
your
arm
raff
she
said
gazing
at
him
anxiously
aye
so
the
words
come
awkward
to
me
and
everything
is
like
a
dream
ye
what
wonder
poor
she
sighed
stroking
his
hand
if
ye
had
not
had
enough
for
a
dozen
the
wit
would
never
have
come
to
ye
again
well
the
lad
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
said
ye
looked
honest
well
he
might
what
then
was
it
noontime
nay
before
daylight
long
before
early
it
was
the
same
day
you
were
hurt
said
the
dame
i
know
it
seemed
that
you
went
to
your
work
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
left
off
where
he
caught
your
arm
yes
resumed
her
husband
and
i
can
see
his
face
this
minute
so
white
and
take
me
down
this
river
a
way
says
he
i
was
working
then
you
ll
remember
far
down
on
the
line
across
from
amsterdam
i
told
him
i
was
no
boatman
it
s
an
affair
of
life
and
death
says
he
take
me
on
a
few
miles
yonder
skiff
is
not
locked
but
it
may
be
a
poor
man
s
boat
and
i
d
be
loath
to
rob
him
the
words
might
differ
some
vrouw
for
it
s
all
like
a
dream
well
i
took
him
down
it
might
be
six
or
eight
miles
and
then
he
said
he
could
run
the
rest
of
the
way
on
shore
i
was
in
haste
to
get
the
boat
back
before
he
jumped
out
he
says
i
can
trust
you
i
ve
done
a
thing
god
knows
i
never
intended
it
but
the
man
is
dead
i
must
fly
from
what
was
it
did
he
say
raff
had
he
been
shooting
at
a
comrade
as
they
do
down
at
the
university
at
gottingen
i
can
t
recall
that
mayhap
he
told
me
but
it
s
all
like
a
dream
i
said
it
wasn
t
for
me
a
good
hollander
to
cheat
the
laws
of
my
country
by
helping
him
off
that
way
but
he
kept
saying
god
knows
i
am
innocent
and
he
looked
at
me
in
the
starlight
as
fair
now
and
as
our
little
hans
might
and
i
just
pulled
away
it
must
have
been
jan
kamphuisen
s
boat
remarked
dame
brinker
dryly
none
other
would
have
left
his
oars
out
that
aye
it
was
jan
s
boat
sure
enough
the
man
will
be
coming
in
to
see
me
sunday
likely
if
he
s
heard
and
young
hoogsvliet
too
where
was
i
where
were
you
why
not
very
far
forsooth
the
lad
hadn
t
yet
given
ye
the
watch
alack
i
misgive
whether
he
came
by
it
honestly
why
vrouw
exclaimed
raff
brinker
in
an
injured
tone
he
was
dressed
soft
and
fine
as
the
prince
himself
the
watch
was
his
own
clear
how
came
he
to
give
it
up
asked
the
dame
looking
uneasily
at
the
fire
for
it
needed
another
block
of
peat
i
told
ye
just
now
he
answered
with
a
puzzled
air
tell
me
again
said
dame
brinker
wisely
warding
off
another
digression
well
just
before
jumping
from
the
boat
he
says
handing
me
the
watch
i
m
flying
from
my
country
as
i
never
thought
i
could
i
ll
trust
you
because
you
look
honest
will
you
take
this
to
my
father
not
today
but
in
a
week
and
tell
him
his
unhappy
boy
sent
it
and
tell
him
if
ever
the
time
comes
that
he
wants
me
to
come
back
to
him
i
ll
brave
everything
and
come
tell
him
to
send
a
letter
to
to
there
the
rest
is
all
gone
from
me
i
can
t
remember
where
the
letter
was
to
go
poor
lad
poor
lad
resumed
raff
sorrowfully
taking
the
watch
from
his
vrouw
s
lap
as
he
spoke
and
it
s
never
been
sent
to
his
father
to
this
i
ll
take
it
raff
never
fear
the
moment
gretel
gets
back
she
will
be
in
soon
what
was
the
father
s
name
did
you
say
where
were
you
to
find
him
alack
answered
raff
speaking
very
slowly
it
s
all
slipped
me
i
can
see
the
lad
s
face
and
his
great
eyes
just
as
plain
and
i
remember
his
opening
the
watch
and
snatching
something
from
it
and
kissing
it
but
no
more
all
the
rest
whirls
past
me
there
s
a
sound
like
rushing
waters
comes
over
me
when
i
try
to
aye
that
s
plain
to
see
raff
but
i
ve
had
the
same
feeling
after
a
fever
you
re
tired
now
i
must
get
ye
straight
on
the
bed
again
where
is
the
child
i
wonder
dame
brinker
opened
the
door
and
called
gretel
gretel
stand
aside
vrouw
said
raff
feebly
as
he
leaned
forward
and
endeavored
to
look
out
upon
the
bare
landscape
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
stand
beyond
the
door
just
nay
she
laughed
i
ll
tell
the
meester
how
ye
tease
and
fidget
and
bother
to
be
let
out
in
the
air
and
if
he
says
it
i
ll
bundle
ye
warm
tomorrow
and
give
ye
a
turn
on
your
feet
but
i
m
freezing
you
with
this
door
open
i
declare
if
there
isn
t
gretel
with
her
apron
full
skating
on
the
canal
like
wild
why
man
she
continued
almost
in
a
scream
as
she
slammed
the
door
thou
rt
walking
to
the
bed
without
my
touching
thee
thou
lt
fall
the
dame
s
thee
proved
her
mingled
fear
and
delight
even
more
than
the
rush
which
she
made
toward
her
husband
soon
he
was
comfortably
settled
under
the
new
cover
declaring
as
his
vrouw
tucked
him
in
snug
and
warm
that
it
was
the
last
daylight
that
should
see
him
abed
aye
i
can
hope
it
myself
laughed
dame
brinker
now
you
have
been
frisking
about
at
that
as
raff
closed
his
eyes
the
dame
hastened
to
revive
her
fire
or
rather
to
dull
it
for
dutch
peat
is
like
a
dutchman
slow
to
kindle
but
very
good
at
a
blaze
once
started
then
putting
her
neglected
spinning
wheel
away
she
drew
forth
her
knitting
from
some
invisible
pocket
and
seated
herself
by
the
bedside
if
you
could
remember
the
man
s
name
raff
she
began
cautiously
i
might
take
the
watch
to
him
while
you
re
sleeping
gretel
can
t
but
be
in
raff
tried
to
think
but
in
vain
could
it
be
boomphoffen
suggested
the
dame
i
ve
heard
how
they
ve
had
two
sons
turn
out
bad
gerard
and
lambert
it
might
be
said
raff
look
if
there
s
letters
on
the
watch
that
ll
guide
us
bless
thee
man
cried
the
happy
dame
eagerly
lifting
the
watch
why
thou
rt
sharper
than
ever
sure
enough
here
s
letters
that
s
lambert
boomphoffen
you
may
depend
what
the
j
is
for
i
can
t
say
but
they
used
to
be
grand
kind
o
people
as
fancy
fowl
just
the
kind
to
give
their
children
all
double
names
which
isn
t
scripture
i
don
t
know
about
that
vrouw
seems
to
me
there
s
long
mixed
names
in
the
holy
book
hard
enough
to
make
out
but
you
ve
got
the
right
guess
at
a
jump
it
was
your
way
always
said
raff
closing
his
eyes
take
the
watch
to
boompkinks
and
not
boompkinks
i
know
no
such
name
it
s
aye
take
it
take
it
there
man
why
the
whole
brood
of
them
s
been
gone
to
america
these
four
years
but
go
to
sleep
raff
you
look
pale
and
out
of
strength
it
ll
al
come
to
you
what
s
best
to
do
in
the
morning
so
mistress
gretel
here
you
are
at
last
before
raff
awoke
that
evening
the
fairy
godmother
as
we
know
had
been
in
the
cottage
the
guilders
were
once
more
safely
locked
in
the
big
chest
and
dame
brinker
and
the
children
were
faring
sumptuously
on
meat
and
white
bread
and
wine
so
the
mother
in
the
joy
of
her
heart
told
them
the
story
of
the
watch
as
far
as
she
deemed
it
prudent
to
divulge
it
it
was
no
more
than
fair
she
thought
that
the
poor
things
should
know
after
keeping
the
secret
so
safe
ever
since
they
had
been
old
enough
to
know
anything
a
discovery
the
next
sun
brought
a
busy
day
to
the
brinkers
in
the
first
place
the
news
of
the
thousand
guilders
had
of
course
to
be
told
to
the
father
such
tidings
as
that
surely
could
not
harm
him
then
while
gretel
was
diligently
obeying
her
mother
s
injunction
to
clean
the
place
fresh
as
a
new
brewing
hans
and
the
dame
sallied
forth
to
revel
in
the
purchasing
of
peat
and
provisions
hans
was
careless
and
contented
the
dame
was
filled
with
delightful
anxieties
caused
by
the
unreasonable
demands
of
ten
thousand
guilders
worth
of
new
wants
that
had
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
in
a
single
night
the
happy
woman
talked
so
largely
to
hans
on
their
way
to
amsterdam
and
brought
back
such
little
bundles
after
all
that
he
scratched
his
bewildered
head
as
he
leaned
against
the
chimney
piece
wondering
whether
bigger
the
pouch
tighter
the
string
was
in
jacob
cats
and
therefore
true
or
whether
he
had
dreamed
it
when
he
lay
in
a
fever
what
thinking
on
chirruped
his
mother
half
reading
his
thoughts
as
she
bustled
about
preparing
the
dinner
what
thinking
on
why
raff
would
ye
believe
it
the
child
thought
to
carry
half
amsterdam
back
on
his
head
bless
us
he
would
have
bought
us
as
much
coffee
as
would
have
filled
this
fire
pot
no
no
my
lad
says
i
no
time
for
leaks
when
the
ship
is
rich
and
then
how
he
stared
aye
just
as
he
stares
this
minute
hoot
lad
fly
around
a
mite
ye
ll
grow
to
the
chimney
place
with
your
staring
and
wondering
now
raff
here
s
your
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
where
it
should
be
for
there
s
a
man
to
the
house
now
i
d
say
it
to
the
king
s
face
aye
that
s
the
way
lean
on
hans
there
s
a
strong
staff
for
you
growing
like
a
weed
too
and
it
seems
only
yesterday
since
he
was
toddling
sit
by
my
man
sit
can
you
call
to
mind
vrouw
said
raff
settling
himself
cautiously
in
the
big
chair
the
wonderful
music
box
that
cheered
your
working
in
the
big
house
at
heidelberg
aye
that
i
can
answered
the
dame
three
turns
of
a
brass
key
and
the
witchy
thing
would
send
the
music
fairly
running
up
and
down
one
s
back
i
remember
it
well
but
raff
growing
solemn
in
an
instant
you
would
never
throw
our
guilders
away
for
a
thing
like
that
no
no
not
i
vrouw
for
the
good
lord
has
already
given
me
a
music
box
without
all
three
cast
quick
frightened
glances
at
one
another
and
at
raff
were
his
wits
on
the
wing
again
aye
and
a
music
box
that
fifty
pouchful
would
not
buy
from
me
insisted
raff
and
it
s
set
going
by
the
turn
of
a
mop
handle
and
it
slips
and
glides
around
the
room
everywhere
in
a
flash
carrying
the
music
about
till
you
d
swear
the
birds
were
back
holy
saint
bavon
screeched
the
dame
what
s
in
the
man
comfort
and
joy
vrouw
that
s
what
s
in
him
ask
gretel
ask
my
little
music
box
gretel
if
your
man
has
lacked
comfort
and
joy
this
not
he
mother
laughed
gretel
he
s
been
my
music
box
too
we
sang
together
half
the
time
you
were
aye
so
said
the
dame
greatly
relieved
now
hans
you
ll
never
get
through
with
a
piece
like
that
but
never
mind
chick
thou
st
had
a
long
fasting
here
gretel
take
another
slice
of
the
sausage
it
ll
put
blood
in
your
oh

mother
laughed
gretel
eagerly
holding
forth
her
platter
blood
doesn
t
grow
in
girls
cheeks
you
mean
roses
isn
t
it
roses
hans
while
hans
was
hastily
swallowing
a
mammoth
mouthful
in
order
to
give
a
suitable
reply
to
this
poetic
appeal
dame
brinker
settled
the
matter
with
a
quick
well
roses
or
blood
it
s
all
one
to
me
so
the
red
finds
its
way
on
your
sunny
face
it
s
enough
for
mother
to
get
pale
and
without
hoot
vrouw
spoke
up
raff
hastily
thou
rt
fresher
and
rosier
this
minute
than
both
our
chicks
put
this
remark
though
not
bearing
very
strong
testimony
to
the
clearness
of
raff
s
newly
awakened
intellect
nevertheless
afforded
the
dame
immense
satisfaction
the
meal
accordingly
went
on
in
the
most
delightful
manner
after
dinner
the
affair
of
the
watch
was
talked
over
and
the
mysterious
initials
duly
discussed
hans
had
just
pushed
back
his
stool
intending
to
start
at
once
for
mynheer
van
holp
s
and
his
mother
had
risen
to
put
the
watch
away
in
its
old
hiding
place
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
frozen
ground
someone
knocked
at
the
door
opening
it
at
the
same
time
come
in
stammered
dame
brinker
hastily
trying
to
hide
the
watch
in
her
bosom
oh
is
it
you
mynheer
good
day
the
father
is
nearly
well
as
you
see
it
s
a
poor
place
to
greet
you
in
mynheer
and
the
dinner
not
cleared
boekman
scarcely
noticed
the
dame
s
apology
he
was
evidently
in
haste
ahem
he
exclaimed
not
needed
here
i
perceive
the
patient
is
mending
well
he
may
mynheer
cried
the
dame
for
only
last
night
we
found
a
thousand
guilders
that
s
been
lost
to
us
these
ten
boekman
opened
his
eyes
yes
mynheer
said
raff
i
bid
the
vrouw
tell
you
though
it
s
to
be
held
a
secret
among
us
for
i
see
you
can
keep
your
lips
closed
as
well
as
any
the
doctor
scowled
he
never
liked
personal
remarks
now
mynheer
continued
raff
you
can
take
your
rightful
pay
god
knows
you
have
earned
it
if
bringing
such
a
poor
tool
back
to
the
world
and
his
family
can
be
called
a
service
tell
the
vrouw
what
s
to
pay
mynheer
she
will
hand
out
the
sum
right
tut
tut
said
the
doctor
kindly
say
nothing
about
money
i
can
find
plenty
of
such
pay
any
time
but
gratitude
comes
seldom
that
boy
s
he
added
nodding
sidewise
toward
hans
was
pay
enough
for
like
enough
ye
have
a
boy
of
your
own
said
dame
brinker
quite
delighted
to
see
the
great
man
becoming
so
sociable
boekman
s
good
nature
vanished
at
once
he
gave
a
growl
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
gretel
but
made
no
actual
reply
do
not
think
the
vrouw
meddlesome
mynheer
said
raff
she
has
been
sore
touched
of
late
about
a
lad
whose
folks
have
gone
away
none
knows
where
and
i
had
a
message
for
them
from
the
young
the
name
was
boomphoffen
said
the
dame
eagerly
do
you
know
aught
of
the
family
mynheer
the
doctor
s
reply
was
brief
and
gruff
yes
a
troublesome
set
they
went
long
since
to
it
might
be
raff
persisted
dame
brinker
timidly
that
the
meester
knows
somebody
in
that
country
though
i
m
told
they
are
mostly
savages
over
there
if
he
could
get
the
watch
to
the
boomphoffens
with
the
poor
lad
s
message
it
would
be
a
most
blessed
tut
vrouw
why
pester
the
good
meester
and
dying
men
and
women
wanting
him
everywhere
how
do
ye
know
ye
have
the
true
name
i
m
sure
of
it
she
replied
they
had
a
son
lambert
and
there
s
an
l
for
lambert
and
a
b
for
boomphoffen
on
the
back
though
to
be
sure
there
s
an
odd
j
too
but
the
meester
can
look
for
so
saying
she
drew
forth
the
watch
cried
boekman
springing
toward
her
why
attempt
to
describe
the
scene
that
followed
i
need
only
say
that
the
lad
s
message
was
delivered
to
his
father
at
last
delivered
while
the
great
surgeon
was
sobbing
like
a
little
child
laurens
my
laurens
he
cried
gazing
with
yearning
eyes
at
the
watch
as
he
held
it
tenderly
in
his
palm
ah
if
i
had
but
known
sooner
laurens
a
homeless
wanderer
great
heaven
he
may
be
suffering
dying
at
this
moment
think
man
where
is
he
where
did
my
boy
say
that
the
letter
must
be
sent
raff
shook
his
head
sadly
think
implored
the
doctor
surely
the
memory
so
lately
awakened
through
his
aid
could
not
refuse
to
serve
him
in
a
moment
like
this
it
is
all
gone
mynheer
sighed
raff
hans
forgetting
distinctions
of
rank
and
station
forgetting
everything
but
that
his
good
friend
was
in
trouble
threw
his
arms
around
the
doctor
s
neck
i
can
find
your
son
mynheer
if
alive
he
is
somewhere
the
earth
is
not
so
very
large
i
will
devote
every
day
of
my
life
to
the
search
mother
can
spare
me
now
you
are
rich
mynheer
send
me
where
you
gretel
began
to
cry
it
was
right
for
hans
to
go
but
how
could
they
ever
live
without
him
boekman
made
no
reply
neither
did
he
push
hans
away
his
eyes
were
fixed
anxiously
upon
raff
brinker
suddenly
he
lifted
the
watch
and
with
trembling
eagerness
attempted
to
open
it
its
stiffened
spring
yielded
at
last
the
case
flew
open
disclosing
a
watch
paper
in
the
back
bearing
a
group
of
blue
raff
seeing
a
shade
of
intense
disappointment
pass
over
the
doctor
s
face
hastened
to
say
there
was
something
else
in
it
mynheer
but
the
young
gentleman
tore
it
out
before
he
handed
it
to
me
i
saw
him
kiss
it
as
he
put
it
it
was
his
mother
s
picture
moaned
the
doctor
she
died
when
he
was
ten
years
old
thank
god
the
boy
had
not
forgotten
both
dead
it
is
impossible
he
cried
starting
up
my
boy
is
alive
you
shall
hear
his
story
laurens
acted
as
my
assistant
by
mistake
he
portioned
out
the
wrong
medicine
for
one
of
my
patients
a
deadly
poison
but
it
was
never
administered
for
i
discovered
the
error
in
time
the
man
died
that
day
i
was
detained
with
other
bad
cases
until
the
next
evening
when
i
reached
home
my
boy
was
gone
poor
laurens
sobbed
the
doctor
breaking
down
completely
never
to
hear
from
me
through
all
these
years
his
message
disregarded
oh
what
he
must
have
suffered
dame
brinker
ventured
to
speak
anything
was
better
than
to
see
the
meester
cry
it
is
a
mercy
to
know
the
young
gentleman
was
innocent
ah
how
he
fretted
telling
you
raff
that
his
crime
was
like
unto
murder
it
was
sending
the
wrong
physic
that
he
meant
crime
indeed
why
our
own
gretel
might
have
done
that
like
enough
the
poor
young
gentleman
heard
that
the
man
was
dead
that
s
why
he
ran
mynheer
he
said
you
know
raff
that
he
never
could
come
back
to
holland
again
unless
she
hesitated
ah
your
honor
ten
years
is
a
dreary
time
to
be
waiting
to
hear
from
hist
vrouw
said
raff
sharply
waiting
to
hear
the
doctor
groaned
and
i
like
a
fool
sitting
stubbornly
at
home
thinking
that
he
had
abandoned
me
i
never
dreamed
brinker
that
the
boy
had
discovered
the
mistake
i
believed
it
was
youthful
folly
ingratitude
love
of
adventure
that
sent
him
away
my
poor
poor
laurens
but
you
know
all
now
mynheer
whispered
hans
you
know
he
was
innocent
of
wrong
that
he
loved
you
and
his
dead
mother
we
will
find
him
you
shall
see
him
again
dear
god
bless
you
said
boekman
seizing
the
boy
s
hand
it
may
be
as
you
say
i
shall
try
i
shall
try
and
brinker
if
ever
the
faintest
gleam
of
recollection
concerning
him
should
come
to
you
you
will
send
me
word
at
once
indeed
we
will
cried
all
but
hans
whose
silent
promise
would
have
satisfied
the
doctor
even
had
the
others
not
spoken
your
boy
s
eyes
he
said
turning
to
dame
brinker
are
strangely
like
my
son
s
the
first
time
i
met
him
it
seemed
that
laurens
himself
was
looking
at
aye
mynheer
replied
the
mother
proudly
i
have
marked
that
you
were
much
drawn
to
the
for
a
few
moments
the
meester
seemed
lost
in
thought
then
arousing
himself
he
spoke
in
a
new
voice
forgive
me
raff
brinker
for
this
tumult
do
not
feel
distressed
on
my
account
i
leave
your
house
today
a
happier
man
than
i
have
been
for
many
a
long
year
shall
i
take
the
watch
certainly
you
must
mynheer
it
was
your
son
s
even
so
responded
the
doctor
regarding
his
treasure
with
a
queer
frown
for
his
face
could
not
throw
off
its
bad
habits
in
an
hour
even
so
and
now
i
must
be
gone
no
medicine
is
needed
by
my
patient
only
peace
and
cheerfulness
and
both
are
here
in
plenty
heaven
bless
you
my
good
friends
i
shall
ever
be
grateful
to
may
heaven
bless
you
too
mynheer
and
may
you
soon
find
the
young
gentleman
said
dame
brinker
earnestly
after
hurriedly
wiping
her
eyes
upon
the
corner
of
her
apron
raff
uttered
a
hearty
amen
and
gretel
threw
such
a
wistful
eager
glance
at
the
doctor
that
he
patted
her
head
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
cottage
hans
went
out
also
when
i
can
serve
you
mynheer
i
am
very
well
boy
replied
boekman
with
peculiar
mildness
tell
them
within
to
say
nothing
of
what
has
just
happened
meantime
hans
when
you
are
with
his
father
watch
his
mood
you
have
tact
at
any
moment
he
may
suddenly
be
able
to
tell
us
trust
me
for
that
good
day
my
boy
cried
the
doctor
as
he
sprang
into
his
stately
coach
aha
thought
hans
as
it
rolled
away
the
meester
has
more
life
in
him
than
i
thought
the
race
the
twentieth
of
december
came
at
last
bringing
with
it
the
perfection
of
winter
weather
all
over
the
level
landscape
lay
the
warm
sunlight
it
tried
its
power
on
lake
canal
and
river
but
the
ice
flashed
defiance
and
showed
no
sign
of
melting
the
very
weathercocks
stood
still
to
enjoy
the
sight
this
gave
the
windmills
a
holiday
nearly
all
the
past
week
they
had
been
whirling
briskly
now
being
rather
out
of
breath
they
rocked
lazily
in
the
clear
still
air
catch
a
windmill
working
when
the
weathercocks
have
nothing
to
do
there
was
an
end
to
grinding
crushing
and
sawing
for
that
day
it
was
a
good
thing
for
the
millers
near
broek
long
before
noon
they
concluded
to
take
in
their
sails
and
go
to
the
race
everybody
would
be
there
already
the
north
side
of
the
frozen
y
was
bordered
with
eager
spectators
the
news
of
the
great
skating
match
had
traveled
far
and
wide
men
women
and
children
in
holiday
attire
were
flocking
toward
the
spot
some
wore
furs
and
wintry
cloaks
or
shawls
but
many
consulting
their
feelings
rather
than
the
almanac
were
dressed
as
for
an
october
day
the
site
selected
for
the
race
was
a
faultless
plain
of
ice
near
amsterdam
on
that
great
arm
of
the
zuider
zee
which
dutchmen
of
course
must
call
the
eye
the
townspeople
turned
out
in
large
numbers
strangers
to
the
city
deemed
it
a
fine
chance
to
see
what
was
to
be
seen
many
a
peasant
from
the
northward
had
wisely
chosen
the
twentieth
as
the
day
for
the
next
city
trading
it
seemed
that
everybody
young
and
old
who
had
wheels
skates
or
feet
at
command
had
hastened
to
the
scene
there
were
the
gentry
in
their
coaches
dressed
like
parisians
fresh
from
the
boulevards
amsterdam
children
in
charity
uniforms
girls
from
the
roman
catholic
orphan
house
in
sable
gowns
and
white
headbands
boys
from
the
burgher
asylum
with
their
black
tights
and
harlequin
coats
this
is
not
said
in
derision
both
the
boys
and
girls
of
this
institution
wear
garments
quartered
in
red
and
black
alternately
by
making
the
dress
thus
conspicuous
the
children
are
in
a
measure
deterred
from
wrongdoing
while
going
about
the
city
the
burgher
orphan
asylum
affords
a
comfortable
home
to
several
hundred
boys
and
girls
holland
is
famous
for
its
charitable
institutions
there
were
gentlemen
in
cocked
hats
and
velvet
knee
breeches
ladies
too
in
stiff
quilted
skirts
and
bodices
of
dazzling
brocade
these
were
accompanied
by
servants
bearing
foot
stoves
and
cloaks
there
were
the
peasant
folk
arrayed
in
every
possible
dutch
costume
shy
young
rustics
in
brazen
buckles
simple
village
maidens
concealing
their
flaxen
hair
under
fillets
of
gold
women
whose
long
narrow
aprons
were
stiff
with
embroidery
women
with
short
corkscrew
curls
hanging
over
their
foreheads
women
with
shaved
heads
and
caps
and
women
in
striped
skirts
and
windmill
bonnets
men
in
leather
in
homespun
in
velvet
and
in
broadcloth
burghers
in
model
european
attire
and
burghers
in
short
jackets
wide
trousers
and
hats
there
were
beautiful
friesland
girls
in
wooden
shoes
and
coarse
petticoats
with
solid
gold
crescents
encircling
their
heads
finished
at
each
temple
with
a
golden
rosette
and
hung
with
lace
a
century
old
some
wore
necklaces
pendants
and
earrings
of
the
purest
gold
many
were
content
with
gilt
or
even
with
brass
but
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
a
friesland
woman
to
have
all
the
family
treasure
in
her
headgear
more
than
one
rustic
lass
displayed
the
value
of
two
thousand
guilders
upon
her
head
that
day
scattered
throughout
the
crowd
were
peasants
from
the
island
or
marken
with
sabots
black
stockings
and
the
widest
of
breeches
also
women
from
marken
with
short
blue
petticoats
and
black
jackets
gaily
figured
in
front
they
wore
red
sleeves
white
aprons
and
a
cap
like
a
bishop
s
miter
over
their
golden
hair
the
children
often
were
as
quaint
and
as
their
elders
in
short
of
the
crowd
seemed
to
have
stepped
bodily
from
a
collection
of
dutch
paintings
everywhere
could
be
seen
tall
women
and
stumpy
men
girls
and
youths
whose
expression
never
changed
from
sunrise
to
sunset
there
seemed
to
be
at
least
one
specimen
from
every
known
town
in
holland
there
were
utrecht
water
bearers
gouda
cheesemakers
delft
pottery
men
schiedam
distillers
amsterdam
diamond
cutters
rotterdam
merchants
herring
packers
and
two
shepherds
from
texel
every
man
of
them
had
his
pipe
and
tobacco
pouch
some
carried
what
might
be
called
the
smoker
s
complete
outfit
a
pipe
tobacco
a
pricker
with
which
to
clean
the
tube
a
silver
net
for
protecting
the
bowl
and
a
box
of
the
strongest
brimstone
matches
a
true
dutchman
you
must
remember
is
rarely
without
his
pipe
on
any
possible
occasion
he
may
for
a
moment
neglect
to
breathe
but
when
the
pipe
is
forgotten
he
must
be
dying
indeed
there
were
no
such
sad
cases
here
wreaths
of
smoke
were
rising
from
every
possible
quarter
the
more
fantastic
the
smoke
wreath
the
more
placid
and
solemn
the
smoker
look
at
those
boys
and
girls
on
stilts
that
is
a
good
idea
they
can
see
over
the
heads
of
the
tallest
it
is
strange
to
see
those
little
bodies
high
in
the
air
carried
about
on
mysterious
legs
they
have
such
a
resolute
look
on
their
round
faces
what
wonder
that
nervous
old
gentlemen
with
tender
feet
wince
and
tremble
while
the
little
monsters
stride
past
them
you
will
read
in
certain
books
that
the
dutch
are
a
quiet
people
so
they
are
generally
but
listen
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
din
all
made
up
of
human
voices
no
the
horses
are
helping
somewhat
and
the
fiddles
are
squeaking
pitifully
how
it
must
pain
fiddles
to
be
tuned
but
the
mass
of
the
sound
comes
from
the
great
vox
humana
that
belongs
to
a
crowd
that
queer
little
dwarf
going
about
with
a
heavy
basket
winding
in
and
out
among
the
people
helps
not
a
little
you
can
hear
his
shrill
cry
above
all
the
other
sounds
pypen
en
tabac
pypen
en
tabac
another
his
big
brother
though
evidently
some
years
younger
is
selling
doughnuts
and
bonbons
he
is
calling
on
all
pretty
children
far
and
near
to
come
quickly
or
the
cakes
will
be
gone
you
know
quite
a
number
among
the
spectators
high
up
in
yonder
pavilion
erected
upon
the
border
of
the
ice
are
some
persons
whom
you
have
seen
very
lately
in
the
center
is
madame
van
gleck
it
is
her
birthday
you
remember
she
has
the
post
of
honor
there
is
mynheer
van
gleck
whose
meerschaum
has
not
really
grown
fast
to
his
lips
it
only
appears
so
there
are
grandfather
and
grandmother
whom
you
met
at
the
saint
nicholas
fete
all
the
children
are
with
them
it
is
so
mild
they
have
brought
even
the
baby
the
poor
little
creature
is
swathed
very
much
after
the
manner
of
an
egyptian
mummy
but
it
can
crow
with
delight
and
when
the
band
is
playing
open
and
shut
its
animated
mittens
in
perfect
time
to
the
music
grandfather
with
his
pipe
and
spectacles
and
fur
cap
makes
quite
a
picture
as
he
holds
baby
upon
his
knee
perched
high
upon
their
canopied
platforms
the
party
can
see
all
that
is
going
on
no
wonder
the
ladies
look
complacently
at
the
glassy
ice
with
a
stove
for
a
foot
stool
one
might
sit
cozily
beside
the
north
pole
there
is
a
gentleman
with
them
who
somewhat
resembles
saint
nicholas
as
he
appeared
to
the
young
van
glecks
on
the
fifth
of
december
but
the
saint
had
a
flowing
white
beard
and
this
face
is
as
smooth
as
a
pippin
his
saintship
was
larger
around
the
body
too
and
between
ourselves
he
had
a
pair
of
thimbles
in
his
mouth
which
this
gentleman
certain
has
not
it
can
not
be
saint
nicholas
after
all
nearby
in
the
next
pavilion
sit
the
van
holps
with
their
son
and
daughter
the
van
gends
from
the
hague
peter
s
sister
is
not
one
to
forget
her
promises
she
has
brought
bouquets
of
exquisite
hothouse
flowers
for
the
winners
these
pavilions
and
there
are
others
besides
have
all
been
erected
since
daylight
that
semicircular
one
containing
mynheer
korbes
s
family
is
very
pretty
and
proves
that
the
hollanders
are
quite
skilled
at
tentmaking
but
i
like
the
van
glecks
best
the
center
one
striped
red
and
white
and
hung
with
evergreens
the
one
with
the
blue
flags
contains
the
musicians
those
pagodalike
affairs
decked
with
seashells
and
streamers
of
every
possible
hue
are
the
judges
stands
and
those
columns
and
flagstaffs
upon
the
ice
mark
the
limit
of
the
race
course
the
two
white
columns
twined
with
green
connected
at
the
top
by
that
long
floating
strip
of
drapery
form
the
starting
point
those
flagstaffs
half
a
mile
off
stand
at
each
end
of
the
boundary
line
which
is
cut
sufficiently
deep
to
be
distinct
to
the
skaters
though
not
deep
enough
to
trip
them
when
they
turn
to
come
back
to
the
starting
point
the
air
is
so
clear
that
is
seems
scarcely
possible
that
the
columns
and
the
flagstaffs
are
so
far
apart
of
course
the
judges
stands
are
but
little
nearer
together
half
a
mile
on
the
ice
when
the
atmosphere
is
like
this
is
but
a
short
distance
after
all
especially
when
fenced
with
a
living
chain
of
spectators
the
music
has
commenced
how
melody
seems
to
enjoy
itself
in
the
open
air
the
fiddles
have
forgotten
their
agony
and
everything
is
harmonious
until
you
look
at
the
blue
tent
it
seems
that
the
music
springs
from
the
sunshine
it
is
so
boundless
so
joyous
only
when
you
see
the
musicians
do
you
realize
the
truth
where
are
the
racers
all
assembled
together
near
the
white
columns
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
forty
boys
and
girls
in
picturesque
attire
darting
with
electric
swiftness
in
and
out
among
each
other
or
sailing
in
pairs
and
triplets
beckoning
chatting
whispering
in
the
fullness
of
youthful
glee
a
few
careful
ones
are
soberly
tightening
their
straps
others
halting
on
one
leg
with
flushed
eager
faces
suddenly
cross
the
suspected
skate
over
their
knee
give
it
an
examining
shake
and
dart
off
again
one
and
all
are
possessed
with
the
spirit
of
motion
they
can
not
stand
still
their
skates
are
a
part
of
them
and
every
runner
seems
bewitched
holland
is
the
place
for
skaters
after
all
where
else
can
nearly
every
boy
and
girl
perform
feats
on
the
ice
that
would
attract
a
crowd
if
seen
in
central
park
look
at
ben
he
is
really
astonishing
the
natives
no
easy
thing
to
do
in
the
netherlands
save
your
strength
ben
you
will
need
it
soon
now
other
boys
are
trying
ben
is
surpassed
already
such
jumping
such
poising
such
spinning
such
exploits
generally
that
boy
with
a
red
cap
is
the
lion
now
his
back
is
a
watch
spring
his
body
is
cork
no
it
is
iron
or
it
would
snap
at
that
he
s
a
bird
a
top
a
rabbit
a
corkscrew
a
sprite
a
fleshball
all
in
an
instant
when
you
think
he
s
erect
he
is
down
and
when
you
think
he
is
down
he
is
up
he
drops
his
glove
on
the
ice
and
turns
a
somersault
as
he
picks
it
up
without
stopping
he
snatches
the
cap
from
jacob
poot
s
astonished
head
and
claps
it
back
again
hindside
hurrah
and
laugh
foolish
boy
it
is
arctic
weather
under
your
feet
but
more
than
temperate
over
head
big
drops
already
are
rolling
down
your
forehead
superb
skater
as
you
are
you
may
lose
the
race
a
french
traveler
standing
with
a
notebook
in
his
hand
sees
our
english
friend
ben
buy
a
doughnut
of
the
dwarf
s
brother
and
eat
it
thereupon
he
writes
in
his
notebook
that
the
dutch
take
enormous
mouthfuls
and
universally
are
fond
of
potatoes
boiled
in
molasses
there
are
some
familiar
faces
near
the
white
columns
lambert
ludwig
peter
and
carl
are
all
there
cool
and
in
good
skating
order
hans
is
not
far
off
evidently
he
is
going
to
join
in
the
race
for
his
skates
are
on
the
very
pair
that
he
sold
for
seven
guilders
he
had
soon
suspected
that
his
fairy
godmother
was
the
mysterious
friend
who
bought
them
this
settled
he
had
boldly
charged
her
with
the
deed
and
she
knowing
well
that
all
her
little
savings
had
been
spent
in
the
purchase
had
not
had
the
face
to
deny
it
through
the
fairy
godmother
too
he
had
been
rendered
amply
able
to
buy
them
back
again
therefore
hans
is
to
be
in
the
race
carl
is
more
indignant
than
ever
about
it
but
as
three
other
peasant
boys
have
entered
hans
is
not
alone
twenty
boys
and
twenty
girls
the
latter
by
this
time
are
standing
in
front
braced
for
the
start
for
they
are
to
have
the
first
hilda
rychie
and
katrinka
are
among
them
two
or
three
bend
hastily
to
give
a
last
pull
at
their
skate
straps
it
is
pretty
to
see
them
stamp
to
be
sure
that
all
is
firm
hilda
is
speaking
pleasantly
to
a
graceful
little
creature
in
a
red
jacket
and
a
new
brown
petticoat
why
it
is
gretel
what
a
difference
those
pretty
shoes
make
and
the
skirt
and
the
new
cap
annie
bouman
is
there
too
even
janzoon
kolp
s
sister
has
been
admitted
but
janzoon
himself
has
been
voted
out
by
the
directors
because
he
killed
the
stork
and
only
last
summer
was
caught
in
the
act
of
robbing
a
bird
s
nest
a
legal
offence
in
holland
this
janzoon
kolp
you
see
was
there
i
can
not
tell
the
story
just
now
the
race
is
about
to
commence
twenty
girls
are
formed
in
a
line
the
music
has
ceased
a
man
whom
we
shall
call
the
crier
stands
between
the
columns
and
the
first
judges
stand
he
reads
the
rules
in
a
loud
voice
the
girls
and
boys
are
to
race
in
turn
until
one
girl
and
one
boy
have
beaten
twice
they
are
to
start
in
a
line
from
the
united
columns
skate
to
the
flagstaff
line
turn
and
then
come
back
to
the
starting
point
thus
making
a
mile
at
each
a
flag
is
waved
from
the
judges
stand
madame
van
gleck
rises
in
her
pavilion
she
leans
forward
with
a
white
handkerchief
in
her
hand
when
she
drops
it
a
bugler
is
to
give
the
signal
for
them
to
start
the
handkerchief
is
fluttering
to
the
ground
hark
they
are
off
no
back
again
their
line
was
not
true
in
passing
the
judges
stand
the
signal
is
repeated
off
again
no
mistake
this
time
whew
how
fast
they
go
the
multitude
is
quiet
for
an
instant
absorbed
in
eager
breathless
watching
cheers
spring
up
along
the
line
of
spectators
huzza
five
girls
are
ahead
who
comes
flying
back
from
the
boundary
mark
we
can
not
tell
something
red
that
is
all
there
is
a
blue
spot
flitting
near
it
and
a
dash
of
yellow
nearer
still
spectators
at
this
end
of
the
line
strain
their
eyes
and
wish
they
had
taken
their
post
nearer
the
flagstaff
the
wave
of
cheers
is
coming
back
again
now
we
can
see
katrinka
is
ahead
she
passes
the
van
holp
pavilion
the
next
is
madame
van
gleck
s
that
leaning
figure
gazing
from
it
is
a
magnet
hilda
shoots
past
katrinka
waving
her
hand
to
her
mother
as
she
passes
two
others
are
close
now
whizzing
on
like
arrows
what
is
that
flash
of
red
and
gray
hurray
it
is
gretel
she
too
waves
her
hand
but
toward
no
gay
pavilion
the
crowd
is
cheering
but
she
hears
only
her
father
s
voice
well
done
little
gretel
soon
katrinka
with
a
quick
merry
laugh
shoots
past
hilda
the
girl
in
yellow
is
gaining
now
she
passes
them
all
all
except
gretel
the
judges
lean
forward
without
seeming
to
lift
their
eyes
from
their
watches
cheer
after
cheer
fills
the
air
the
very
columns
seem
rocking
gretel
has
passed
them
she
has
won
gretel
brinker
one
mile
shouts
the
crier
the
judges
nod
they
write
something
upon
a
tablet
which
each
holds
in
his
hand
while
the
girls
are
resting
some
crowding
eagerly
around
our
frightened
little
gretel
some
standing
aside
in
high
disdain
the
boys
form
a
line
mynheer
van
gleck
drops
the
handkerchief
this
time
the
buglers
give
a
vigorous
blast
the
boys
have
started
halfway
already
did
ever
you
see
the
like
three
hundred
legs
flashing
by
in
an
instant
but
there
are
only
twenty
boys
no
matter
there
were
hundreds
of
legs
i
am
sure
where
are
they
now
there
is
such
a
noise
one
gets
bewildered
what
are
the
people
laughing
at
oh
at
that
fat
boy
in
the
rear
see
him
go
see
him
he
ll
be
down
in
an
instant
no
he
won
t
i
wonder
if
he
knows
he
is
all
alone
the
other
boys
are
nearly
at
the
boundary
line
yes
he
knows
it
he
stops
he
wipes
his
hot
face
he
takes
off
his
cap
and
looks
about
him
better
to
give
up
with
a
good
grace
he
has
made
a
hundred
friends
by
that
hearty
astonished
laugh
good
jacob
poot
the
fine
fellow
is
already
among
the
spectators
gazing
as
eagerly
as
the
rest
a
cloud
of
feathery
ice
flies
from
the
heels
of
the
skaters
as
they
bring
to
and
turn
at
the
flagstaffs
something
black
is
coming
now
one
of
the
boys
it
is
all
we
know
he
has
touched
the
vox
humana
stop
of
the
crowd
it
fairly
roars
now
they
come
nearer
we
can
see
the
red
cap
there
s
ben
there
s
peter
there
s
hans
hans
is
ahead
young
madame
van
gend
almost
crushes
the
flowers
in
her
hand
she
had
been
quite
sure
that
peter
would
be
first
carl
schummel
is
next
then
ben
and
the
youth
with
the
red
cap
a
tall
figure
darts
from
among
them
he
passes
the
red
cap
he
passes
ben
then
carl
now
it
is
an
even
race
between
him
and
hans
madame
van
gend
catches
her
breath
it
is
peter
he
is
ahead
hans
shoots
past
him
hilda
s
eyes
fill
with
tears
peter
must
beat
annie
s
eyes
flash
proudly
gretel
gazes
with
clasped
hands
four
strokes
more
will
take
her
brother
to
the
columns
he
is
there
yes
but
so
was
young
schummel
just
a
second
before
at
the
last
instant
carl
gathering
his
powers
had
whizzed
between
them
and
passed
the
goal
carl
schummel
one
mile
shouts
the
crier
soon
madame
van
gleck
rises
again
the
falling
handkerchief
starts
the
bugle
and
the
bugle
using
its
voice
as
a
bowstring
shoots
of
twenty
girls
like
so
many
arrows
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
but
one
has
not
long
to
look
before
we
can
fairly
distinguish
them
they
are
far
in
the
distance
this
time
they
are
close
upon
one
another
it
is
hard
to
say
as
they
come
speeding
back
from
the
flagstaff
which
will
reach
the
columns
first
there
are
new
faces
among
the
foremost
eager
glowing
faces
unnoticed
before
katrinka
is
there
and
hilda
but
gretel
and
rychie
are
in
the
rear
gretel
is
wavering
but
when
rychie
passes
her
she
starts
forward
afresh
now
they
are
nearly
beside
katrinka
hilda
is
still
in
advance
she
is
almost
she
has
not
faltered
since
that
bugle
note
sent
her
flying
like
an
arrow
still
she
is
speeding
toward
the
goal
cheer
after
cheer
rises
in
the
air
peter
is
silent
but
his
eyes
shine
like
stars
huzza
huzza
the
crier
s
voice
is
heard
again
hilda
van
gleck
one
mile
a
loud
murmur
of
approval
runs
through
the
crowd
catching
the
music
in
its
course
till
all
seems
one
sound
with
a
glad
rhythmic
throbbing
in
its
depths
when
the
flag
waves
all
is
still
once
more
the
bugle
blows
a
terrific
blast
it
sends
off
the
boys
like
chaff
before
the
wind
dark
chaff
i
admit
and
in
big
pieces
it
is
whisked
around
at
the
flagstaff
driven
faster
yet
by
the
cheers
and
shouts
along
the
line
we
begin
to
see
what
is
coming
there
are
three
boys
in
advance
this
time
and
all
abreast
hans
peter
and
lambert
carl
soon
breaks
the
ranks
rushing
through
with
a
whiff
fly
hans
fly
peter
don
t
let
carl
beat
again
carl
the
bitter
carl
the
insolent
van
mounen
is
flagging
but
you
are
strong
as
ever
hans
and
peter
peter
and
hans
which
is
foremost
we
love
them
both
we
scarcely
care
which
is
the
fleeter
hilda
annie
and
gretel
seated
upon
the
long
crimson
bench
can
remain
quiet
no
longer
they
spring
to
their
feet
so
different
and
yet
one
in
eagerness
hilda
instantly
reseats
herself
none
shall
know
how
interested
she
is
none
shall
know
how
anxious
how
filled
with
one
hope
shut
your
eyes
then
hilda
hide
our
face
rippling
with
joy
peter
has
beaten
peter
van
holp
one
mile
calls
the
crier
the
same
buzz
of
excitement
as
before
while
the
judges
take
notes
the
same
throbbing
of
music
through
the
din
but
something
is
different
a
little
crowd
presses
close
about
some
object
near
the
column
carl
has
fallen
he
is
not
hurt
though
somewhat
stunned
if
he
were
less
sullen
he
would
find
more
sympathy
in
these
warm
young
hearts
as
it
is
they
forget
him
as
soon
as
he
is
fairly
on
his
feet
again
the
girls
are
to
skate
their
third
mile
how
resolute
the
little
maidens
look
as
they
stand
in
a
line
some
are
solemn
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
some
wear
a
smile
half
bashful
half
provoked
but
one
air
of
determination
pervades
them
all
this
third
mile
may
decide
the
race
still
if
neither
gretel
nor
hilda
wins
there
is
yet
a
chance
among
the
rest
for
the
silver
skates
each
girl
feels
sure
that
this
time
she
will
accomplish
the
distance
in
one
half
of
the
time
how
they
stamp
to
try
their
runners
how
nervously
they
examine
each
strap
how
erect
they
stand
at
last
every
eye
upon
madame
van
gleck
the
bugle
thrills
through
them
again
with
quivering
eagerness
they
spring
forward
bending
but
in
perfect
balance
each
flashing
stroke
seems
longer
than
the
last
now
they
are
skimming
off
in
the
distance
again
the
eager
straining
of
eyes
again
the
shouts
and
cheering
again
the
thrill
of
excitement
as
after
a
few
moments
four
or
five
in
advance
of
the
rest
come
speeding
back
nearer
nearer
to
the
white
columns
who
is
first
not
rychie
katrinka
annie
nor
hilda
nor
the
girl
in
yellow
but
gretel
gretel
the
fleetest
sprite
of
a
girl
that
ever
skated
she
was
but
playing
in
the
earlier
races
now
she
is
in
earnest
or
rather
something
within
her
has
determined
to
win
that
lithe
little
form
makes
no
effort
but
it
can
not
stop
not
until
the
goal
is
passed
in
vain
the
crier
lifts
his
voice
he
can
not
be
heard
he
has
no
news
to
tell
it
is
already
ringing
through
the
crowd
gretel
has
won
the
silver
skates
like
a
bird
she
has
flown
over
the
ice
like
a
bird
she
looks
about
her
in
a
timid
startled
way
she
longs
to
dart
to
the
sheltered
nook
where
her
father
and
mother
stand
but
hans
is
beside
her
the
girls
are
crowding
round
hilda
s
kind
joyous
voice
breathes
in
her
ear
from
that
hour
none
will
despise
her
goose
girl
or
not
gretel
stands
acknowledged
queen
of
the
skaters
with
natural
pride
hans
turns
to
see
if
peter
van
holp
is
witnessing
his
sister
s
triumph
peter
is
not
looking
toward
them
at
all

hans
cried
peter
yielding
at
last
he
sprang
to
his
post
just
as
the
white
handkerchief
fell
to
the
ground
the
bugle
sends
forth
its
blast
loud
clear
and
ringing
off
go
the
boys

a
tough
old
fellow

your

only
cheering
the

close
upon

the
white
column
it
beckons
it

reeling
before

it
huzza
huzza
peter
has
won
the
silver
skates
peter
van
holp
shouted
the
crier
but
who
heard
him
peter
van
holp
shouted
a
hundred
voices
for
he
was
the
favorite
boy
of
the
place
huzza
huzza
now
the
music
was
resolved
to
be
heard
it
struck
up
a
lively
air
then
a
tremendous
march
the
spectators
thinking
something
new
was
about
to
happen
deigned
to
listen
and
to
look
the
racers
formed
in
single
file
peter
being
tallest
stood
first
gretel
the
smallest
of
all
took
her
place
at
the
end
hans
who
had
borrowed
a
strap
from
the
cake
boy
was
near
the
head
three
gaily
twined
arches
were
placed
at
intervals
upon
the
river
facing
the
van
gleck
pavilion
skating
slowly
and
in
perfect
time
to
the
music
the
boys
and
girls
moved
forward
led
on
by
peter
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
bright
procession
glide
along
like
a
living
creature
it
curved
and
doubled
and
drew
its
graceful
length
in
and
out
among
the
arches
whichever
way
peter
the
head
went
the
body
was
sure
to
follow
sometimes
it
steered
direct
for
the
center
arch
then
as
if
seized
with
a
new
impulse
turned
away
and
curled
itself
about
the
first
one
then
unwound
slowly
and
bending
low
with
quick
snakelike
curvings
crossed
the
river
passing
at
length
through
the
furthest
arch
when
the
music
was
slow
the
procession
seemed
to
crawl
like
a
thing
afraid
it
grew
livelier
and
the
creature
darted
forward
with
a
spring
gliding
rapidly
among
the
arches
in
and
out
curling
twisting
turning
never
losing
form
until
at
the
shrill
call
of
the
bugle
rising
above
the
music
it
suddenly
resolved
itself
into
boys
and
girls
standing
in
a
double
semicircle
before
madam
van
gleck
s
pavilion
peter
and
gretel
stand
in
the
center
in
advance
of
the
others
madame
van
gleck
rises
majestically
gretel
trembles
but
feels
that
she
must
look
at
the
beautiful
lady
she
can
not
hear
what
is
said
there
is
such
a
buzzing
all
around
her
she
is
thinking
that
she
ought
to
try
and
make
a
curtsy
such
as
her
mother
makes
to
the
meester
when
suddenly
something
so
dazzling
is
placed
in
her
hand
that
she
gives
a
cry
of
joy
then
she
ventures
to
look
about
her
peter
too
has
something
in
his
hands
oh
oh
how
splendid
she
cries
and
oh
how
splendid
is
echoed
as
far
as
people
can
see
meantime
the
silver
skates
flash
in
the
sunshine
throwing
dashes
of
light
upon
those
two
happy
faces
mevrouw
van
gend
sends
a
little
messenger
with
her
bouquets
one
for
hilda
one
for
carl
and
others
for
peter
and
gretel
at
sight
of
the
flowers
the
queen
of
the
skaters
becomes
uncontrollable
with
a
bright
stare
of
gratitude
she
gathers
skates
and
bouquets
in
her
apron
hugs
them
to
her
bosom
and
darts
off
to
search
for
her
father
and
mother
in
the
scattering
crowd
joy
in
the
cottage
perhaps
you
were
surprised
to
learn
that
raff
and
his
vrouw
were
at
the
skating
race
you
would
have
been
more
so
had
you
been
with
them
on
the
evening
of
that
merry
twentieth
of
december
to
see
the
brinker
cottage
standing
sulkily
alone
on
the
frozen
marsh
with
its
bulgy
walls
and
its
slouched
hat
of
a
roof
pulled
far
over
its
eyes
one
would
never
suspect
that
a
lively
scene
was
passing
within
without
nothing
was
left
of
the
day
but
a
low
line
of
blaze
at
the
horizon
a
few
venturesome
clouds
had
already
taken
fire
and
others
with
their
edges
burning
were
lost
in
the
gathering
smoke
a
stray
gleam
of
sunshine
slipping
down
from
the
willow
stump
crept
stealthily
under
the
cottage
it
seemed
to
feel
that
the
inmates
would
give
it
welcome
if
it
could
only
get
near
them
the
room
under
which
it
hid
was
as
clean
as
clean
could
be
the
very
cracks
in
the
rafters
were
polished
delicious
odors
filled
the
air
a
huge
peat
fire
upon
the
hearth
sent
flashes
of
harmless
lightning
at
the
somber
walls
it
played
in
turn
upon
the
great
leather
bible
upon
gretel
s
the
household
things
upon
their
pegs
and
the
beautiful
silver
skates
and
the
flowers
upon
the
table
dame
brinker
s
honest
face
shone
and
twinkled
in
the
changing
light
gretel
and
hans
with
arms
entwined
were
leaning
against
the
fireplace
laughing
merrily
and
raff
brinker
was
dancing
i
do
not
mean
that
he
was
pirouetting
or
cutting
a
either
of
which
would
have
been
entirely
too
undignified
for
the
father
of
a
family
i
simply
affirm
that
while
they
were
chatting
pleasantly
together
raff
suddenly
sprang
from
his
seat
snapped
his
fingers
and
performed
two
or
three
flourishes
very
much
like
the
climax
of
a
highland
fling
next
he
caught
his
vrouw
in
his
arms
and
fairly
lifted
her
from
the
ground
in
his
delight
huzza
he
cried
i
have
it
i
have
it
it
s
thomas
higgs
that
s
the
name
it
came
upon
me
like
a
flash
write
it
down
lad
write
it
down
someone
knocked
at
the
door
it
s
the
meester
cried
the
delighted
dame
goede
gunst
how
things
come
to
pass
mother
and
children
came
in
merry
collision
as
they
rushed
to
open
the
door
it
was
not
the
doctor
after
all
but
three
boys
peter
van
holp
lambert
and
ben
good
evening
young
gentlemen
said
dame
brinker
so
happy
and
proud
that
she
would
scarcely
have
been
surprised
at
a
visit
from
the
king
himself
good
evening
jufvrouw
said
the
trio
making
magnificent
bows
dear
me
thought
dame
brinker
as
she
bobbed
up
and
down
like
a
churn
dasher
it
s
lucky
i
learned
to
curtsy
at
heidelberg
raff
was
content
to
return
the
boys
salutations
with
a
respectful
nod
pray
be
seated
young
masters
said
the
dame
as
gretel
bashfully
thrust
a
stool
at
them
there
s
a
lack
of
chairs
as
you
see
but
this
one
by
the
fire
is
at
your
service
and
if
you
don
t
mind
the
hardness
that
oak
chest
is
as
good
a
seat
as
the
best
that
s
right
hans
pull
it
by
the
time
the
boys
were
seated
to
the
dame
s
satisfaction
peter
acting
as
a
spokesman
had
explained
that
they
were
going
to
attend
a
lecture
at
amsterdam
and
had
stopped
on
the
way
to
return
hans
s
strap
oh
mynheer
cried
hans
earnestly
it
is
too
much
trouble
i
am
very
no
trouble
at
all
hans
i
could
have
waited
for
you
to
come
to
your
work
tomorrow
had
i
not
wished
to
call
and
hans
talking
of
your
work
my
father
is
much
pleased
with
it
a
carver
by
trade
could
not
have
done
it
better
he
would
like
to
have
the
south
arbor
ornamented
also
but
i
told
him
you
were
going
to
school
aye
put
in
raff
brinker
emphatically
hans
must
go
to
school
at
once
and
gretel
as
well
that
is
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
responded
peter
turning
toward
the
father
and
very
glad
to
know
that
you
are
again
a
well
yes
young
master
a
well
man
and
able
to
work
as
steady
as
ever
thank
god
here
hans
hastily
wrote
something
on
the
edge
of
a
almanac
that
hung
by
the
aye
that
s
right
lad
set
it
down
figgs
wiggs
alack
alack
added
raff
in
great
dismay
it
s
gone
again
all
right
father
said
hans
the
name
s
down
now
in
black
and
white
here
look
at
it
father
mayhap
the
rest
will
come
to
you
if
we
had
the
place
as
well
it
would
be
complete
then
turning
to
peter
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
have
an
important
errand
in
town
mynheer
and
if
wist
exclaimed
the
dame
lifting
her
hands
not
to
amsterdam
tonight
and
you
ve
owned
your
legs
were
aching
under
you
nay
nay
it
ll
be
soon
enough
to
go
at
early
daylight
indeed
echoed
raff
that
would
never
do
nay
meitje
he
must
go
this
the
vrouw
looked
for
an
instant
as
if
raff
s
recovery
was
becoming
rather
a
doubtful
benefit
her
word
was
no
longer
sole
law
in
the
house
fortunately
the
proverb
humble
wife
is
husband
s
boss
had
taken
deep
root
in
her
mind
even
as
the
dame
pondered
it
bloomed
very
well
raff
she
said
smilingly
it
is
thy
boy
as
well
as
mine
ah
i
ve
a
troublesome
house
young
just
then
peter
drew
a
long
strap
from
his
pocket
handing
it
to
hans
he
said
in
an
undertone
i
need
not
thank
you
for
lending
me
this
hans
brinker
such
boys
as
you
do
not
ask
for
thanks
but
i
must
say
you
did
me
a
great
kindness
and
i
am
proud
to
acknowledge
it
i
did
not
know
he
added
laughingly
until
fairly
in
the
race
how
anxious
i
was
to
hans
was
glad
to
join
in
peter
s
laugh
it
covered
his
embarrassment
and
gave
his
face
a
chance
to
cool
off
a
little
honest
generous
boys
like
hans
have
such
a
stupid
way
of
blushing
when
you
least
expect
it
it
was
nothing
mynheer
said
the
dame
hastening
to
her
son
s
relief
the
lad
s
whole
soul
was
in
having
you
win
the
race
i
know
it
was
this
helped
matters
beautifully
ah
mynheer
hans
hurried
to
say
from
the
first
start
i
felt
stiff
and
strange
on
my
feet
i
was
well
out
of
it
so
long
as
i
had
no
chance
of
peter
looked
rather
distressed
we
may
hold
different
opinions
here
that
part
of
the
business
troubles
me
it
is
too
late
to
mend
it
now
but
it
would
be
really
a
kindness
to
me
if
the
rest
of
peter
s
speech
was
uttered
so
confidentially
that
i
can
not
record
it
enough
to
say
hans
soon
started
back
in
dismay
and
peter
looking
very
much
ashamed
stammered
out
something
to
the
effect
that
he
would
keep
them
since
he
won
the
race
but
it
was
all
here
van
mounen
coughed
as
if
to
remind
peter
that
lecture
hour
was
approaching
fast
at
the
same
moment
ben
laid
something
upon
the
table
ah
exclaimed
peter
i
forgot
my
other
errand
your
sister
ran
off
so
quickly
today
that
madame
van
gleck
had
no
opportunity
to
give
her
the
case
for
her
said
dame
brinker
shaking
her
head
reproachfully
at
gretel
she
was
a
very
rude
girl
i
m
secretly
she
was
thinking
that
very
few
women
had
such
a
fine
little
daughter
no
indeed
peter
laughed
she
did
exactly
the
right
thing
ran
home
with
her
richly
won
treasures
who
would
not
don
t
let
us
detain
you
hans
he
continued
turning
around
as
he
spoke
but
hans
who
was
eagerly
watching
his
father
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
presence
meantime
raff
lost
in
thought
was
repeating
under
his
breath
thomas
higgs
thomas
higgs
aye
that
s
the
name
alack
if
i
could
but
remember
the
place
as
the
skate
case
was
elegantly
made
of
crimson
morocco
ornamented
with
silver
if
a
fairy
had
designed
its
delicate
tracery
they
could
not
have
been
more
daintily
beautiful
for
the
fleetest
was
written
upon
the
cover
in
sparkling
letters
it
was
lined
with
velvet
and
in
one
corner
was
stamped
the
name
and
address
of
the
maker
gretel
thanked
peter
in
her
own
simple
way
then
being
quite
delighted
and
confused
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
she
lifted
the
case
carefully
examining
it
in
every
part
it
s
made
by
mynheer
birmingham
she
said
after
a
while
still
blushing
and
holding
it
before
her
eyes
birmingham
replied
lambert
van
mounen
that
s
the
name
of
a
place
in
england
let
me
see
ha
ha
he
laughed
holding
the
open
case
toward
the
firelight
no
wonder
you
thought
so
but
it
s
a
slight
mistake
the
case
was
made
at
birmingham
but
the
maker
s
name
is
in
smaller
letters
humph
they
re
so
small
i
can
t
read
let
me
try
said
peter
leaning
over
his
shoulder
why
man
it
s
perfectly
distinct
it
s
it
s
t
well
exclaimed
lambert
triumphantly
if
you
can
read
it
so
easily
let
s
hear
it
what
oh
why
thomas
higgs
to
be
sure
replied
peter
pleased
to
be
able
to
decipher
it
at
last
then
feeling
that
they
had
been
acting
rather
unceremoniously
he
turned
to
hans
peter
turned
pale
what
was
the
matter
with
the
people
raff
and
hans
had
started
up
and
were
staring
at
him
in
glad
amazement
gretel
looked
wild
dame
brinker
with
an
unlighted
candle
in
her
hand
was
rushing
about
the
room
crying
hans
hans
where
s
your
hat
oh
the
meester
oh
the
meester
birmingham
higgs
exclaimed
hans
did
you
say
higgs

found

must
be

see
young
the
dame
was
panting
at
the
same
time
snatching
hans
s
hat
from
the
bed
you
see
we
know

our
no
he

panted
hans
radiant
with
sudden
joy
good
night

will
excuse
me
i
must
go
birmingham
higgs
higgs
and
seizing
his
hat
from
his
mother
and
his
skates
from
gretel
he
rushed
from
the
cottage
what
could
the
boys
think
but
that
the
entire
brinker
family
had
suddenly
gone
crazy
they
bade
an
embarrassed
good
evening
and
turned
to
go
but
raff
stopped
them
this
thomas
higgs
young
masters
is
a
a
ah
exclaimed
peter
quite
sure
that
raff
was
the
most
crazy
of
all
yes
a
person
a
ahem
a
friend
we
thought
him
dead
i
hope
it
is
the
same
man
in
england
did
you
say
yes
birmingham
answered
peter
it
must
be
birmingham
in
i
know
the
man
said
ben
addressing
lambert
his
factory
is
not
four
miles
from
our
place
a
queer
fellow
still
as
an
oyster
doesn
t
seem
at
all
like
an
englishman
i
ve
often
seen
him
a
chap
with
magnificent
eyes
he
made
a
beautiful
writing
case
once
for
me
to
give
jenny
on
her
birthday
makes
pocketbooks
telescope
cases
and
all
kinds
of
as
this
was
said
in
english
van
mounen
of
course
translated
it
for
the
benefit
of
all
concerned
noticing
meanwhile
that
neither
raff
nor
his
vrouw
looked
very
miserable
though
raff
was
trembling
and
the
dame
s
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
you
may
believe
that
the
doctor
heard
every
word
of
the
story
when
later
in
the
evening
he
came
driving
back
with
hans
the
three
young
gentlemen
have
been
gone
some
time
dame
brinker
said
but
like
enough
by
hurrying
it
would
be
easy
to
find
them
coming
out
from
the
lecture
wherever
that
true
said
raff
nodding
his
head
the
vrouw
always
hits
upon
the
right
thing
it
would
be
well
to
see
the
young
english
gentleman
mynheer
before
he
forgets
all
about
thomas
higgs
it
s
a
slippery
name
d
ye
see
one
can
t
hold
it
safe
a
minute
it
come
upon
me
sudden
and
strong
as
a
pile
driver
and
my
boy
writ
it
down
aye
mynheer
i
d
haste
to
talk
with
the
english
lad
he
s
seen
your
son
many
a
time
only
to
think
on
t
dame
brinker
took
up
the
thread
of
the
discourse
you
ll
pick
out
the
lad
quick
enough
mynheer
because
he
s
in
company
with
peter
van
holp
and
his
hair
curls
up
over
his
forehead
like
foreign
folk
s
and
if
you
hear
him
speak
he
talks
of
big
and
fast
only
it
s
english
but
that
wouldn
t
be
any
hindrance
to
your
the
doctor
had
already
lifted
his
hat
to
go
with
a
beaming
face
he
muttered
something
about
its
being
just
like
the
young
scamp
to
give
himself
a
rascally
english
name
called
hans
my
son
thereby
making
that
young
gentleman
as
happy
as
a
lord
and
left
the
cottage
with
very
little
ceremony
considering
what
a
great
meester
he
was
the
grumbling
coachman
comforted
himself
by
speaking
his
mind
as
he
drove
back
to
amsterdam
since
the
doctor
was
safely
stowed
away
in
the
coach
and
could
not
hear
a
word
it
was
a
fine
time
to
say
terrible
things
of
folks
who
hadn
t
no
manner
of
feeling
for
nobody
and
who
were
always
wanting
the
horses
a
dozen
times
of
a
night
mysterious
disappearance
of
thomas
higgs
higgs
s
factory
was
a
mine
of
delight
for
the
gossips
of
birmingham
it
was
a
small
building
but
quite
large
enough
to
hold
a
mystery
who
the
proprietor
was
or
where
he
came
from
none
could
tell
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
that
was
certain
though
everybody
knew
he
had
risen
from
an
apprenticeship
and
he
could
handle
his
pen
like
a
writing
master
years
ago
he
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
place
a
lad
of
eighteen
learned
his
trade
faithfully
and
risen
in
the
confidence
of
his
employer
been
taken
in
as
a
partner
soon
after
the
time
was
up
finally
when
old
willett
died
had
assumed
the
business
on
his
own
hands
this
was
all
that
was
known
of
his
affairs
it
was
a
common
remark
among
some
of
the
good
people
that
he
never
had
a
word
to
say
to
a
christian
soul
while
others
declared
that
though
he
spoke
beautifully
when
he
chose
to
there
was
something
wrong
in
his
accent
a
tidy
man
too
they
called
him
all
but
for
having
that
scandalous
green
pond
alongside
of
his
factory
which
wasn
t
deep
enough
for
an
eel
and
was
just
a
fever
nest
as
sure
as
you
his
nationality
was
a
great
puzzle
the
english
name
spoke
plain
enough
for
one
side
of
his
house
but
of
what
manner
of
nation
was
his
mother
if
she
d
been
an
american
he
d
certainly
have
had
high
cheekbones
and
reddish
skin
if
a
german
he
would
have
known
the
language
and
squire
smith
declared
that
he
didn
t
if
french
and
his
having
that
frog
pond
made
it
seem
likely
it
would
come
out
in
his
speech
no
there
was
nothing
he
could
be
but
dutch
and
strangest
of
all
though
the
man
always
pricked
up
his
ears
when
you
talked
of
holland
he
didn
t
seem
to
know
the
first
thing
about
the
country
when
you
put
him
to
the
point
anyhow
as
no
letters
ever
came
to
him
from
his
mother
s
family
in
holland
and
as
nobody
living
had
ever
seen
old
higgs
the
family
couldn
t
be
anything
much
probably
thomas
higgs
himself
was
no
better
than
he
should
be
for
all
he
pretended
to
carry
himself
so
straight
and
for
their
parts
the
gossips
declared
they
were
not
going
to
trouble
their
heads
about
him
consequently
thomas
higgs
and
his
affairs
were
subjects
of
discussion
picture
then
the
consternation
among
all
the
good
people
when
it
was
announced
by
somebody
who
was
there
and
ought
to
know
that
the
postboy
had
that
very
morning
handed
higgs
a
letter
and
the
man
had
turned
as
white
as
the
wall
rushed
to
his
factory
talked
a
bit
with
one
of
the
head
workmen
and
without
bidding
a
creature
was
off
bag
and
baggage
before
you
could
wink
ma
mistress
scrubbs
his
landlady
was
in
deep
affliction
the
dear
soul
became
quite
out
of
breath
while
speaking
of
him
to
leave
lodgin
s
in
that
suddent
way
without
never
so
much
as
a
day
s
warnin
which
was
what
every
woman
who
didn
t
wish
to
be
trodden
underfoot
which
thank
hevving
wasn
t
her
way
had
a
perfect
right
to
expect
yes
and
a
week
s
warnin
now
you
mention
it
and
without
even
so
much
as
sayin
many
thanks
mistress
scrubbs
for
all
past
kindnesses
which
was
most
numerous
though
she
said
it
who
shouldn
t
say
it
leastwise
she
wasn
t
never
no
kind
of
person
to
be
lookin
for
thanks
every
minnit
it
was
really
scanderlous
though
to
be
sure
mister
iggs
paid
up
everythin
to
the
last
farthin
and
it
fairly
brought
tears
to
my
eyes
to
see
his
dear
empty
boots
lyin
there
in
the
corner
of
his
room
which
alone
showed
trouble
of
mind
for
he
always
stood
em
up
straight
as
solgers
though
bein
twice
they
hadn
t
of
course
been
worth
takin
whereupon
her
dearest
friend
miss
scrumpkins
ran
home
to
tell
all
about
it
and
as
everybody
knew
the
scrumpkinses
a
shining
gossamer
of
news
was
soon
woven
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
an
investigating
committee
met
that
evening
at
snigham
s
sitting
in
secret
session
over
her
best
china
though
invited
only
to
a
quiet
tea
the
amount
of
judicial
business
they
transacted
on
the
occasion
was
prodigious
the
biscuits
were
actually
cold
before
the
committee
had
a
chance
to
eat
anything
there
was
so
much
to
talk
over
and
it
was
so
important
that
it
should
be
firmly
established
that
each
member
had
always
been
certain
sure
that
something
extraordinary
would
be
happening
to
that
man
yet
that
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
before
snigham
gave
anybody
a
second
cup
broad
sunshine
one
snowy
day
in
january
laurens
boekman
went
with
his
father
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
brinker
family
raff
was
resting
after
the
labors
of
the
day
gretel
having
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
was
brushing
every
speck
of
ash
from
the
hearth
the
dame
was
spinning
and
hans
perched
upon
a
stool
by
the
window
was
diligently
studying
his
lessons
it
was
a
peaceful
happy
household
whose
main
excitement
during
the
past
week
had
been
the
looking
forward
to
this
possible
visit
from
thomas
higgs
as
soon
as
the
grand
presentation
was
over
dame
brinker
insisted
upon
giving
her
guests
some
hot
tea
it
was
enough
to
freeze
anyone
she
said
to
be
out
in
such
crazy
blustering
weather
while
they
were
talking
with
her
husband
she
whispered
to
gretel
that
the
young
gentleman
s
eyes
and
her
boy
s
were
certainly
as
much
alike
as
four
beans
to
say
nothing
of
a
way
they
both
had
of
looking
as
if
they
were
stupid
and
yet
knew
as
much
as
a
body
s
grandfather
gretel
was
disappointed
she
had
looked
forward
to
a
tragic
scene
such
as
annie
bouman
had
often
described
to
her
from
storybooks
and
here
was
the
gentleman
who
came
so
near
being
a
murderer
who
for
ten
years
had
been
wandering
over
the
face
of
the
earth
who
believed
himself
deserted
and
scorned
by
his
father
the
very
young
gentleman
who
had
fled
from
his
country
in
such
magnificent
trouble
sitting
by
the
fire
just
as
pleasant
and
natural
as
could
be
to
be
sure
his
voice
had
trembled
when
he
talked
with
her
parents
and
he
had
met
his
father
s
look
with
a
bright
kind
of
smile
that
would
have
suited
a
bringing
the
waters
of
perpetual
youth
to
his
king
but
after
all
he
wasn
t
at
all
like
the
conquered
hero
in
annie
s
book
he
did
not
say
lifting
his
arm
toward
heaven
i
hereby
swear
to
be
forever
faithful
to
my
home
my
god
and
my
country
which
would
have
been
only
right
and
proper
under
the
circumstances
all
things
considered
gretel
was
disappointed
raff
however
was
perfectly
satisfied
the
message
was
delivered
boekman
had
his
son
safe
and
sound
and
the
poor
lad
had
done
nothing
sinful
after
all
except
in
thinking
that
his
father
would
have
abandoned
him
for
an
accident
to
be
sure
the
graceful
stripling
had
become
rather
a
heavy
man
raff
had
unconsciously
hoped
to
clasp
that
same
boyish
hand
again
but
all
things
were
changed
to
raff
for
that
matter
so
he
pushed
back
every
feeling
but
joy
as
he
saw
father
and
son
sitting
side
by
side
at
his
hearthstone
meantime
hans
was
wholly
occupied
in
the
thought
of
thomas
higgs
s
happiness
in
being
able
to
be
the
meester
s
assistant
again
and
dame
brinker
was
sighing
softly
to
herself
wishing
that
the
lad
s
mother
were
alive
to
see
him
such
a
fine
young
gentleman
as
he
was
and
wondering
how
boekman
could
bear
to
see
the
silver
watch
getting
so
dull
he
had
worn
it
ever
since
raff
handed
it
over
that
was
evident
what
had
he
done
with
the
gold
one
he
used
to
wear
the
light
was
shining
full
upon
boekman
s
face
how
contented
he
looked
how
much
younger
and
brighter
than
formerly
the
hard
lines
were
quite
melting
away
he
was
laughing
as
he
said
to
the
father
am
i
not
a
happy
man
raff
brinker
my
son
will
sell
out
his
factory
this
month
and
open
a
warehouse
in
amsterdam
i
shall
have
all
my
spectacle
cases
for
hans
started
from
his
reverie
a
warehouse
mynheer
and
will
thomas
higgs
i
mean
is
your
son
not
to
be
your
assistant
again
a
shade
passed
over
the
meester
s
face
but
he
brightened
with
an
effort
as
he
replied
oh
no
laurens
has
had
quite
enough
of
that
he
wishes
to
be
a
hans
appeared
so
surprised
and
disappointed
that
his
friend
asked
why
so
silent
boy
is
it
any
disgrace
to
be
a
merchant
a
disgrace
mynheer
stammered
hans
but
but
what
why
the
other
calling
is
so
much
better
answered
hans
so
much
nobler
i
think
mynheer
he
added
with
enthusiasm
that
to
be
a
surgeon
to
cure
the
sick
and
crippled
to
save
human
life
to
be
able
to
do
what
you
have
done
for
my
father
is
the
grandest
thing
on
the
doctor
was
regarding
him
sternly
hans
felt
rebuked
his
cheeks
were
flushed
hot
tears
were
gathering
under
his
lashes
it
is
an
ugly
business
boy
this
surgery
said
the
doctor
still
frowning
at
hans
it
requires
great
patience
and
i
am
sure
that
it
does
cried
hans
it
calls
for
wisdom
too
and
a
reverence
for
god
s
work
ah
mynheer
it
may
have
its
trials
and
drawbacks
but
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
it
is
great
and
noble
not
ugly
pardon
me
mynheer
it
is
not
for
me
to
speak
so
boekman
was
evidently
displeased
he
turned
his
back
on
the
boy
and
conferred
aside
with
laurens
meanwhile
the
dame
scowled
a
terrible
warning
at
hans
these
great
people
she
knew
well
enough
never
like
to
hear
poor
folk
speak
up
so
pertly
the
meester
turned
around
how
old
are
you
hans
brinker
fifteen
mynheer
was
the
startled
reply
would
you
like
to
become
a
physician
yes
mynheer
answered
hans
quivering
with
excitement
would
you
be
willing
with
your
parents
consent
to
devote
yourself
to
study
to
go
to
the
university
and
in
time
be
a
student
in
my
office
yes
you
would
not
grow
restless
think
you
and
change
your
mind
just
as
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
preparing
you
to
be
my
successor
hans
s
eyes
flashed
no
mynheer
i
would
not
you
may
believe
him
there
cried
the
dame
who
could
remain
quiet
no
longer
hans
is
like
a
rock
when
once
he
decides
and
as
for
study
mynheer
the
child
has
almost
grown
fast
to
his
books
of
late
he
can
jumble
off
latin
already
like
any
priest
the
doctor
smiled
well
hans
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
carrying
out
this
plan
if
your
father
ahem
said
raff
too
proud
of
his
boy
to
be
very
meek
the
fact
is
mynheer
i
prefer
an
active
life
myself
but
if
the
lad
s
inclined
to
study
for
a
meester
and
he
d
have
the
benefit
of
your
good
word
to
push
him
on
in
the
world
it
s
all
one
to
me
the
money
s
all
that
s
wanting
but
it
mightn
t
be
long
with
two
strong
pair
of
arms
to
earn
it
before
we
tut
tut
interrupted
the
doctor
if
i
take
your
man
away
i
must
pay
the
cost
and
glad
enough
will
i
be
to
do
it
it
will
be
like
having
two
sons
eh
laurens
one
a
merchant
and
the
other
a
surgeon
i
shall
be
the
happiest
man
in
holland
come
to
me
in
the
morning
hans
and
we
will
arrange
matters
at
hans
bowed
assent
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
and
brinker
continued
the
doctor
my
son
laurens
will
need
a
trusty
ready
man
like
you
when
he
opens
his
warehouse
in
amsterdam
someone
to
oversee
matters
and
see
that
the
lazy
clowns
round
about
the
place
do
their
duty
someone
to
why
don
t
you
tell
him
yourself
you
rascal
this
last
was
addressed
to
the
son
and
did
not
sound
half
as
fierce
as
it
looks
in
print
the
rascal
and
raff
soon
understood
each
other
perfectly
i
m
loath
to
leave
the
dikes
said
the
latter
after
they
had
talked
together
awhile
but
it
is
such
a
good
offer
mynheer
i
d
be
robbing
my
family
if
i
let
it
go
past
take
a
long
look
at
hans
as
he
sits
there
staring
gratefully
at
the
meester
for
you
shall
not
see
him
again
for
many
years
and
gretel
ah
what
a
vista
of
puzzling
work
suddenly
opens
before
her
yes
for
dear
hans
s
sake
she
will
study
now
if
he
really
is
to
be
a
meester
his
sister
must
not
shame
his
greatness
how
faithfully
those
glancing
eyes
shall
yet
seek
for
the
jewels
that
lie
hidden
in
rocky
schoolbooks
and
how
they
shall
yet
brighten
and
droop
at
the
coming
of
one
whom
she
knows
of
now
only
as
the
boy
who
wore
a
red
cap
on
that
wonderful
day
when
she
found
the
silver
skates
in
her
apron
but
the
doctor
and
laurens
are
going
dame
brinker
is
making
her
best
curtsy
raff
stands
beside
her
looking
every
inch
a
man
as
he
grasps
the
meester
s
hand
through
the
open
cottage
door
we
can
look
out
upon
the
level
dutch
landscape
all
alive
with
the
falling
snow
conclusion
our
story
is
nearly
told
time
passes
in
holland
just
as
surely
and
steadily
as
here
in
that
respect
no
country
is
odd
to
the
brinker
family
it
has
brought
great
changes
hans
has
spent
the
years
faithfully
and
profitably
conquering
obstacles
as
they
arose
and
pursuing
one
object
with
all
the
energy
of
his
nature
if
often
the
way
has
been
rugged
his
resolution
has
never
failed
sometimes
he
echoes
with
his
good
friend
the
words
said
long
ago
in
that
little
cottage
near
broek
surgery
is
an
ugly
business
but
always
in
his
heart
of
hearts
lingers
the
echo
of
those
truer
words
it
is
great
and
noble
it
awakes
a
reverence
for
god
s
work
were
you
in
amsterdam
today
you
might
see
the
famous
brinker
riding
in
his
grand
coach
to
visit
his
patients
or
it
might
be
you
would
see
him
skating
with
his
own
boys
and
girls
upon
the
frozen
canal
for
annie
bouman
the
beautiful
peasant
girl
you
would
inquire
in
vain
but
annie
brinker
the
vrouw
of
the
great
physician
is
very
like
her
only
as
hans
says
she
is
even
lovelier
wiser
more
like
a
fairy
godmother
than
ever
peter
van
holp
also
is
a
married
man
i
could
have
told
you
before
that
he
and
hilda
would
join
hands
and
glide
through
life
together
just
as
years
ago
they
skimmed
side
by
side
over
the
frozen
sunlit
river
at
one
time
i
came
near
hinting
that
katrinka
and
carl
would
join
hands
it
is
fortunate
that
the
report
was
not
started
for
katrinka
changed
her
mind
and
is
single
to
this
day
the
lady
is
not
quite
so
merry
as
formerly
and
i
grieve
to
say
some
of
the
tinkling
bells
are
out
of
tune
but
she
is
the
life
of
her
social
circle
still
i
wish
she
would
be
in
earnest
just
for
a
little
while
but
no
it
is
not
in
her
nature
her
cares
and
sorrows
do
nothing
more
than
disturb
the
tinkling
they
never
waken
any
deeper
music
rychie
s
soul
has
been
stirred
to
its
depths
during
these
long
years
her
history
would
tell
how
seed
carelessly
sown
is
sometimes
reaped
in
anguish
and
how
a
golden
harvest
may
follow
a
painful
planting
if
i
mistake
not
you
may
be
able
to
read
the
written
record
before
long
that
is
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
dutch
language
in
the
witty
but
earnest
author
whose
words
are
welcomed
to
this
day
in
thousands
of
holland
homes
few
could
recognize
the
haughty
flippant
rychie
who
scoffed
at
little
gretel
lambert
van
mounen
and
ludwig
van
holp
are
good
christian
men
and
what
is
more
easily
to
be
seen
at
a
glance
thriving
citizens
both
are
dwellers
in
amsterdam
but
one
clings
to
the
old
city
of
that
name
and
the
other
is
a
pilgrim
to
the
new
van
mounen
s
present
home
is
not
far
from
central
park
and
he
says
if
the
new
yorkers
do
their
duty
the
park
will
in
time
equal
his
beautiful
bosch
near
the
hague
he
often
thinks
of
the
katrinka
of
his
boyhood
but
he
is
glad
now
that
katrinka
the
woman
sent
him
away
though
it
seemed
at
the
time
his
darkest
hour
ben
s
sister
jenny
has
made
him
very
happy
happier
than
he
could
have
been
with
anyone
else
in
the
wide
world
carl
schummel
has
had
a
hard
life
his
father
met
with
reverses
in
business
and
as
carl
had
not
many
warm
friends
and
above
all
was
not
sustained
by
noble
principles
he
has
been
tossed
about
by
fortune
s
battledore
until
his
gayest
feathers
are
nearly
all
knocked
off
he
is
a
bookkeeper
in
the
thriving
amsterdam
house
of
boekman
and
schimmelpenninck
voostenwalbert
the
junior
partner
treats
him
kindly
and
he
in
turn
is
very
respectful
to
the
monkey
with
a
long
name
for
a
of
all
our
group
of
holland
friends
jacob
poot
is
the
only
one
who
has
passed
away
and
unselfish
to
the
last
he
is
mourned
now
as
heartily
as
he
was
loved
and
laughed
at
while
on
earth
he
grew
to
be
very
thin
before
he
died
thinner
than
benjamin
dobbs
who
is
now
portliest
among
the
portly
raff
brinker
and
his
vrouw
have
been
living
comfortably
in
amsterdam
for
many
years
a
faithful
happy
pair
as
simple
and
straightforward
in
their
good
fortune
as
they
were
patient
and
trustful
in
darker
days
they
have
a
zomerhuis
near
the
old
cottage
and
thither
they
often
repair
with
their
children
and
grandchildren
on
the
pleasant
summer
afternoons
when
the
pond
lilies
rear
their
queenly
heads
above
the
water
the
story
of
hans
brinker
would
be
but
half
told
if
we
did
not
leave
him
with
gretel
standing
near
dear
quick
patient
little
gretel
what
is
she
now
ask
old
boekman
he
will
declare
that
she
is
the
finest
singer
the
loveliest
woman
in
amsterdam
ask
hans
and
annie
they
will
assure
you
that
she
is
the
dearest
sister
ever
known
ask
her
husband
he
will
tell
you
that
she
is
the
brightest
sweetest
little
wife
in
holland
ask
dame
brinker
and
raff
their
eyes
will
glisten
with
joyous
tears
ask
the
poor
and
the
air
will
be
filled
with
blessings
but
lest
you
forget
a
tiny
form
trembling
and
sobbing
on
the
mound
before
the
brinker
cottage
ask
the
van
glecks
they
will
never
weary
of
telling
of
the
darling
little
girl
who
won
the
silver
skates
