a
note
on
the
author
of
messer
marco
polo
so
celtic
in
feeling
and
atmosphere
are
the
stories
of
donn
byrne
that
many
of
his
devotees
have
come
to
believe
that
he
never
lived
anywhere
but
in
ireland
actually
donn
byrne
was
born
in
new
york
city
shortly
after
his
birth
however
his
parents
took
him
back
to
the
land
of
his
forefathers
there
he
was
educated
and
came
to
know
the
people
of
whom
he
wrote
so
magically
at
dublin
university
his
love
for
the
irish
language
and
for
a
good
fight
won
him
many
prizes
first
as
a
writer
in
gaelic
and
second
as
the
university
lightweight
boxing
champion
after
continuing
his
studies
at
the
sorbonne
and
the
university
of
leipzig
he
returned
to
the
united
states
where
in
he
married
and
established
a
home
in
brooklyn
heights
he
earned
his
living
while
trying
to
write
short
stories
as
an
editor
of
dictionaries
soon
his
tales
began
to
attract
attention
and
he
added
to
his
collection
of
boxing
prizes
many
others
won
in
contests
when
messer
marco
polo
appeared
in
his
reputation
in
the
literary
world
was
firmly
established
thereafter
whatever
he
wrote
was
hailed
enthusiastically
by
his
public
until
when
his
tragic
death
in
an
automobile
accident
cut
short
the
career
of
one
of
america
jtable
messer
marco
polo
the
message
came
to
me
at
the
second
check
of
the
hunt
that
a
countryman
and
a
clansman
needed
me
the
ground
was
heavy
the
day
raw
and
it
was
a
drag
too
fast
for
fun
and
too
tame
for
sport
so
i
blessed
the
countryman
and
the
clansman
and
turned
my
back
on
the
field
but
when
they
told
me
his
name
i
all
but
fell
from
the
saddle
but
that
man
dead
but
he
was
dead
he
was
in
new
york
he
was
traveling
from
the
craigs
of
ulster
to
his
grandson
who
had
an
on
the
indian
river
in
florida
he
was
dead
and
i
said
to
myself
with
impatience
must
every
man
born
ninety
years
ago
be
dead
but
this
is
a
damned
thing
i
thought
to
be
saddled
with
a
man
over
ninety
years
old
to
have
to
act
as
at
my
age
why
could
he
have
stayed
and
died
at
home
sure
one
of
these
days
he
will
die
as
we
all
die
and
the
ghost
of
him
will
never
be
content
on
the
sluggish
river
by
the
mossy
trees
where
the
blue
herons
and
the
white
cranes
and
the
great
gray
pelicans
fly
it
will
be
going
back
i
know
to
the
booming
surf
and
the
and
the
barking
eagles
of
antrim
to
die
out
of
ulster
when
one
can
die
in
ulster
there
is
a
gey
foolish
thing
but
the
harsh
logic
of
ulster
left
me
and
the
soft
mood
of
ulster
came
on
me
as
i
remembered
him
and
i
going
into
the
town
on
the
train
and
the
late
winter
grass
of
westchester
spare
scrofulous
the
bungalows
the
lines
of
uncomely
linen
the
blatant
advertising
boards
all
the
unbeauty
of
it
passed
away
and
i
was
again
in
the
antrim
glens
there
was
the
soft
purple
of
the
irish
channel
and
there
the
soft
dim
outline
of
scotland
there
was
the
herring
school
silver
in
the
sun
and
i
could
see
it
from
the
crags
where
the
surf
boomed
like
a
drum
and
underfoot
was
the
springy
heather
the
belled
and
purple
heather
and
there
came
to
me
again
the
vision
of
the
old
man
thatched
farmhouse
when
the
moon
was
up
and
the
bats
were
out
and
the
winds
of
the
county
antrim
came
bellying
down
the
glens
the
turf
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
now
red
now
yellow
and
there
was
the
golden
light
of
lamps
and
malachi
of
the
long
glen
was
reciting
some
poem
of
blind
raftery
or
the
lament
of
pierre
ronsard
for
mary
queen
of

there
is
a
ribbon
from
my
only
love
in
my
pocket
deep
and
the
women
of
europe
they
could
not
cure
my
grief
alas
i
am
done
with
you
until
a
narrow
coffin
be
made
for
me
and
until
the
grass
shall
grow
after
that
up
through
my
heart
and
i
suddenly
discovered
on
the
rumbling
train
that
apart
from
the
hurling
and
the
and
the
jumping
of
horses
what
life
i
remembered
of
ulster
was
bound
up
in
malachi
campbell
of
the
long
glen
a
very
strange
old
man
hardy
as
a
blackthorn
immense
bowed
shoulders
the
face
of
some
old
hawk
of
the
mountains
hair
white
and
plentiful
as
some
old
cardinal
all
his
kinsfolk
were
dead
except
for
one
granddaughter
and
he
had
become
a
tradition
in
the
glens
it
was
said
he
had
been
an
ecclesiastical
student
abroad
in
valladolid
and
that
he
had
forsaken
that
life
and
in
france
he
had
been
a
tutor
in
the
family
of
macmahon
roi
d
irlande
and
somewhere
he
had
married
and
his
wife
had
died
and
left
him
money
and
he
had
come
back
to
antrim
he
had
been
in
the
papal
zouaves
and
fought
also
in
the
american
civil
war
a
strange
old
figure
who
knew
greek
and
latin
as
well
as
most
professors
and
who
had
never
forgotten
his
gaelic
antrim
will
ever
color
my
own
writing
my
fifth
avenue
will
have
something
in
it
of
the
heather
glen
my
people
will
have
always
a
phrase
a
thought
a
flash
of
mysticism
and
for
that
i
must
either
thank
or
blame
malachi
campbell
of
the
long
glen
the
stories
i
heard
and
i
young
were
not
of
little
rollo
and
sir
walter
scott
but
the
horrible
tale
of
the
naked
hangman
who
goes
through
the
valleys
on
midsummer
eve
of
dermot
and
granye
of
the
bright
breasts
of
the
cattle
raid
of
maeve
queen
of
connacht
of
the
old
age
of
cuchulain
in
the
island
of
skye
grisly
homely
stories
such
as
yon
of
the
ghostly
of
cushendun
whose
ball
is
a
skull
and
whose
goal
is
the
portals
of
a
ruined
graveyard
strange
religious
poems
like
the
dialogue
of
death
and
the
sinner
do
thugainn
loistin
do
gach
deoraidh
i
used
to
give
lodging
to
every
poor
wanderer
food
and
drink
to
him
i
would
see
in
want
his
proper
payment
to
the
man
requesting
reckoning
och
is
not
jesus
hard
if
he
condemns
me
all
these
stories
of
all
these
people
he
told
had
the
unreal
shimmering
quality
of
that
mirage
that
is
seen
from
portrush
cliffs
a
glittering
city
in
a
golden
desert
surrounded
by
a
strange
sea
mist
all
these
songs
all
these
words
he
spoke
were
native
had
the
same
tang
as
the
turf
smoke
the
gaelic
quality
that
is
in
dark
lakes
on
mountains
summits
in
plovers
nests
amid
the
heather
and
to
remember
them
now
in
new
york
to
see
him
fifteen
years
had
changed
him
but
little
little
more
tremor
and
slowness
in
the
walk
a
bow
to
the
great
shoulders
an
eye
that
flashed
like
a
knife
and
what
do
you
think
of
new
york
malachi
i
was
here
before
your
honor
will
remember
i
fought
at
the
wilderness
i
forbore
asking
him
what
change
he
had
found
i
saw
his
quivering
nostrils
in
a
few
days
he
would
proceed
south
when
he
had
orientated
himself
after
the
days
of
shipboard
that
night
it
seemed
every
one
chose
to
come
in
and
cluster
around
the
fire
randall
the
poet
and
the
two
blond
danish
girls
with
their
hair
like
flax
fraser
the
golfer
just
over
from
prestwick
and
a
young
writer
with
his
spurs
yet
to
win
and
this
one
and
that
one
they
all
kept
silence
as
old
malach
spoke
sportsmen
artists
men
and
women
of
the
world
a
hush
came
on
them
and
their
eyes
showed
they
were
not
before
the
crackling
fire
in
the
long
rooms
but
amazed
in
the
antrim
glens
yes
old
malachi
said
things
were
changed
over
there
and
a
greater
change
was
liable
people
whispered
that
in
the
valley
of
the
black
pig
the
boar
without
bristles
had
been
seen
at
the
close
of
the
day
and
in
templemore
there
was
a
bleeding
image
and
these
were
ominous
portents
some
folks
believed
and
some
did
and
the
great
irish
hunter
that
had
won
the
grand
national
the
greatest
horse
in
the
world
but
our
man
of
war
malachi
oh
sure
all
he
could
do
was
run
and
a
hare
or
a
greyhound
could
beat
him
at
that
but
shawn
spadah
a
great
jumper
him
as
well
as
a
runner
in
fine
a
horse
and
did
i
know
that
red
simon
mcewer
of
cushundall
had
gone
around
portrush
in
eighteen
consecutive
fours
a
rathlin
islander
had
tried
the
swim
across
to
scotland
but
did
make
it
and
there
was
great
arguing
as
to
whether
it
was
because
of
the
currents
or
of
lack
of
strength
there
were
rumblings
in
the
giants
causeway
very
strange
a
woman
in
oran
had
the
second
sight
the
most
powerful
gift
of
second
sight
in
generations
there
was
a
new
piper
in
islay
and
it
was
said
he
was
a
second
mccrimmon
and
a
new
poet
had
arisen
in
uist
and
all
over
the
highlands
they
were
reciting
his
songs
and
his
lament
for
the
bruce
was
i
still
as
keen
for
did
i
still
remember
the
poems
and
the
great
stories
the
night
is
of
great
length
i
quoted
tell
us
therefore
of
those
wondrous
deeds
if
you
remembered
your
gaidhlig
as
you
remembered
your
greek
it
a
long
time
since
you
had
a
story
of
me
twelve
long
years
and
it
a
long
time
before
you
have
another
and
i
going
away
tomorrow
old
sergeant
death
has
his
warrant
out
for
me
this
many
a
day
and
it
only
the
wisdom
of
an
old
dog
fox
that
eludes
him
but
he
lay
me
by
the
heels
one
of
these
days
then
there
be
an
end
to
the
grand
stories
so
after
this
if
you
wanting
a
story
you
must
be
writing
it
yourself
but
before
i
die
i
leave
you
the
story
of
marco
polo
been
a
power
of
books
written
about
marco
polo
the
scholars
have
pushed
up
their
spectacles
and
brushed
the
cobwebs
from
their
ears
and
they
said
all
there
is
about
marco
polo
but
the
scholars
are
a
queer
and
blind
people
brian
oge
i
heard
tell
there
a
doctor
in
spain
can
weigh
the
earth
but
he
ca
plow
a
furrow
that
is
needful
for
planting
corn
the
scholars
can
tell
how
many
are
the
feathers
in
a
bird
wing
but
it
takes
me
to
inform
the
doctors
why
the
call
comes
to
them
and
they
fly
over
oceans
without
compass
or
sextant
or
sight
of
land
did
you
ever
see
a
scholar
standing
in
front
of
a
slip
of
a
girl
in
all
his
learning
he
can
find
nothing
to
say
to
her
and
every
penny
poet
in
the
country
knows
let
you
be
listening
now
brian
oge
and
let
also
the
scholars
be
listening
but
whether
the
scholars
do
or
not
i
not
caring
a
pope
once
listened
to
me
with
great
respect
and
a
marshal
of
france
and
poets
without
number
but
the
scholars
do
be
turning
up
their
noses
and
mind
you
i
got
as
much
scholarship
as
the
next
man
as
see
from
my
story
barring
myself
is
there
no
one
in
this
house
that
takes
snuff
no
ah
well
times
do
be
changing
chapter
i
now
it
nearing
night
on
the
first
day
of
spring
and
you
could
see
how
loath
day
was
to
be
going
for
even
the
short
time
until
the
rising
of
the
sun
again
and
though
there
was
a
chill
on
the
canals
yet
there
was
great
color
to
the
sunset
the
red
of
it
on
the
water
ebbing
into
orange
and
then
to
purple
and
losing
itself
in
the
olive
pools
near
the
and
a
little
wind
came
up
from
the
greek
islands
and
now
surged
and
fluttered
the
way
you
think
a
harper
might
be
playing
you
hear
no
sound
but
the
melody
was
there
it
was
the
rhythm
of
spring
that
the
old
people
recognize
but
the
young
people
would
know
it
was
spring
too
by
token
of
the
gaiety
that
was
in
the
air
for
nothing
brings
joy
to
the
heart
like
the
coming
of
spring
the
folk
who
do
be
blind
all
the
rest
of
the
year
their
eyes
do
open
then
and
a
sunset
takes
them
and
the
wee
virgin
flowers
coming
up
between
the
stones
or
the
twitter
of
a
bird
upon
the
bough
and
young
women
do
be
preening
themselves
and
young
men
do
be
singing
even
they
that
have
the
voices
of
rooks
there
is
something
stirring
in
them
that
is
stirring
in
the
ground
with
the
bursting
of
the
seeds
and
young
marco
polo
threw
down
the
quill
in
the
counting
house
where
he
was
learning
his
trade
the
night
was
coming
on
he
was
only
a
strip
of
a
lad
and
to
lads
the
night
is
not
rest
from
work
and
the
quietness
of
sleeping
but
gaming
and
drinking
and
courting
young
women
now
there
were
two
women
he
might
have
gone
to
and
one
was
a
great
venetian
lady
with
hair
the
red
of
a
queen
cloak
and
a
great
noble
shape
to
her
and
great
dignity
but
with
her
he
would
only
be
reciting
verses
or
making
grand
stilted
compliments
the
like
of
those
you
would
hear
in
a
play
and
while
that
seemed
to
fit
in
with
winter
and
candlelight
it
was
poor
sport
for
spring
the
other
one
was
a
black
plump
little
a
pleasant
singing
little
woman
very
affectionate
and
very
proud
to
have
one
of
the
great
polos
loving
her
she
was
eager
for
kissing
and
always
asking
the
lad
to
be
careful
of
himself
to
be
putting
his
cloak
on
or
to
be
sure
and
drink
something
warm
when
he
got
home
that
night
for
the
air
from
the
canals
was
chill
the
great
lady
was
too
much
of
the
mind
and
the
little
was
too
much
of
the
body
either
of
them
to
be
pleasing
young
marco
on
the
first
night
of
spring
now
it
is
a
queer
thing
will
be
pleasing
a
young
man
on
the
first
night
of
spring
the
wandering
foot
itches
and
the
mind
and
body
are
keen
to
follow
there
is
that
inside
a
young
man
that
makes
the
hunting
dog
rise
from
the
hearth
on
a
moonlit
night
begor
myself
take
a
turn
through
the
fields
on
the
chance
of
a
bit
of
coursing
a
weasel
maybe
or
an
otter
would
be
out
the
night
or
a
hare
itself
ay
there
would
be
sport
for
you
the
hare
running
and
me
after
him
over
brake
and
dell
ay
ay
ay
a
good
hunt
a
jewel
i
take
a
stretch
along
the
road
or
there
is
in
him
what
does
be
troubling
the
birds
and
they
on
tropic
islands
they
grumble
a
grand
place
this
surely
and
very
comfortable
for
the
winter
the
are
green
but
rather
have
the
green
of
young
grass
and
the
sea
you
ken
it
becomes
monotonous
do
you
remember
the
peaches
of
champagne
wife
and
the
of
antrim
do
you
remember
the
farmer
who
was
such
a
bad
shot
and
his
wife
with
the
red
petticoat
i
feeling
fine
and
strong
in
the
wings
avourneen
what
do
you
say
let
bundle
and
go
he
wandered
out
with
the
discontent
of
the
season
on
him
the
sun
had
dropped
at
last
and
everywhere
you
see
torches
and
the

there
was
a
great
admiral

ready
to
put
to

against
genoa
there
a
big
merchantman
back
from
africa
and
along
the
canals
went
all
the
people
in
the
world
you
think
now
it
was
a
frenchman
all
silks
and
satins
and
monsieur
or
a
spaniard
with
a
pointed
beard
and
long
lean
legs
and
a
long
lean
sword
and
now
it
was
a
greek
courtesan
white
as
milk
sitting
in
her
gondola
as
on
a
throne
here
was
a
muscovite
hairy
dirty
with
fine
fur
and
fine
jewels
and
teeth
sharp
as
a
dog
and
now
an
effeminate
greek
nobleman
languid
as
a

and
here
were
moorish
captains
othello
men
great
giants
of
black
marble
and
swarthy
merchants
of
palestine
and
the
squires
of
crusaders
pretty
ringleted
boys
swearing
like
demons
and
here
and
there
were
scots
and
irish
mercenaries
kilted
sensitive
folk
one
moment
smiling
at
you
and
the
next
a
knife
in
your
gizzard
and
as
he
went
through
the
courts
there
were
whispers
and
laughter
and
occasionally
a
soft
voice
invited
him
to
enter
but
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
near
the
canal
de
mestre
which
is
close
by
the
ghetto
he
stopped
by
the
called
the
prince
of
bulgaria
and
he
could
hear
great
disputation
and
some
were
speaking
of
baldwin
ii
and
how
he
had
no
guts
to
have
let
palaeologus
take
constantinople
from
him
and
others
were
murmuring
about
genoa
mark
us
they
mean
trouble
those
dogs
better
wipe
them
off
the
face
of

now
and
a
group
were
discussing
the
chances
of
raiding
the
jewish
kingdom
of
the

they
got
temples
there
roofed
with
and
an

now
you
might
be
thinking
that
the
picture
i
drawing
is
out
of
my
own
head
let
you
not
be
thinking
of
it
as
it
is
now
a
city
of
shadows
and
ghosts
with
a
few
scant
visitors
mooning
in

were
no

as
for

oh
the
wonder
of
the

she
was
tribute
she

now
it
only
a
town
like
any
other

for
its

she
was
a
maiden

bright
and

and
sidon
carthage
ancient

and
venice
queen
of
them
all
i
am
describing
venice
to
you
for
this
reason
you
might
now
stand
where
troy
walls
once
were
and
say
to
yourself
was
this
where
helen
walked
with
her
little
son
was
this
where
the
loveliest
face
of
ages
wept
and
a
chill
of
doubt
would
come
on
you
and
you
would
think
i
been
wasting
my
sorrow
and
wasting
my
love
for
it
was
all
nothing
but
an
old
tale
made
up
in
a
minstrel
head
and
sometime
in
venice
after
your
dinner
in
a
hotel
you
go
out
for
a
while
in
a
barca
that
would
have
no
more
romance
to
it
nor
the
bark
a
gillie
would
row
and
you
on
a
cold
blustery
day
and
you
would
feel
disappointed
you
having
come
so
far
and
you
say
it
was
a
grand
story
surely
and
bravely
did
it
pass
the
winter
evening
but
was
old
malachi
of
the
long
glen
the
liar
of
the
world
i
would
have
you
saying
that
and
i
dead
in
all
i
telling
you
i
have
you
to
know
there
not
a
of
lie
chapter
iii
and
so
marco
polo
went
into
the
to
see
and
hear
the
strange
foreign
people
it
was
a
dark
long
room
very
high
full
of
shadows
between
the
flaming
torches
on
the
wall
at
one
side
of
it
was
a
great
fire
burning
for
all
it
was
the
first
night
of
spring
at
one
end
of
it
were
the
great
barrels
of
liquor
for
the
thirsty
customers
black
beer
for
the
english
and
the
irish
grand
hairy
stuff
with
great
foam
to
it
and
brown
beer
for
the
germans
and
there
was
white
wine
there
for
the
french
people
and
red
wine
for
the
italians
asquebaugh
for
the
scots
and
rum
from
the
sugar
cane
for
such
as
had
cold
in
their
bones
there
was
all
kind
of
drink
there
in
the
barrels
drink
would
make
you
mad
and
drink
would
make
you
merry
drink
would
put
heart
in
a
timid
man
and
drink
would
make
fighting
men
peaceful
as
pigeons
and
drink
that
would
make
you
forget
trouble
all
in
the
barrels
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
pleasant
fat
little
men
were
roaming
around
serving
the
varied
liquor
in
little
silver
cups
and
fine
venetian
glasses
for
the
wine
and
in
that
would
hold
more
than
a
quart
and
there
was
such
a
babel
of
language
as
was
never
heard
but
in
one
place
before
some
of
the
drinkers
were
dicing
and
shouting
as
they
won
and
grumbling
and
cursing
when
they
lost
and
some
were
singing
and
some
were
dancing
to
the
irish
pipes
and
there
was
a
knot
around
the
indian
conjurer
but
there
was
one
man
by
himself
at
a
table
and
him
being
so
silent
you
think
he
was
shouting
for
attention
he
was
so
restful
against
the
great
commotion
you
know
he
was
a
great
man
you
might
turn
your
back
on
him
and
you
know
he
was
there
though
he
never
even
whispered
nor
put
out
a
finger
a
fat
pleasant
man
he
was
in
loose
green
clothes
with
gold
brocade
on
them
and
there
were
two
big
gold
in
his
lobes
he
smoked
a
wee
pipe
with
the
bowl
up
it
the
pipe
was
silver
and
all
stem
and
the
bowl
no
bigger
than
a
piece
his
shoulders
were
very
powerful
so
you
know
he
was
a
man
you
should
be
polite
to
and
out
of
that
chest
of
his
a
great
shout
could
come
he
might
have
been
a
only
when
he
fingered
his
pipe
you
see
his
hands
were
as
well
kept
as
a
lord
lady
fine
as
silk
and
polished
to
a
degree
and
you
think
maybe
a
pleasant
poet
which
is
a
scarce
thing
until
you
looked
at
the
brown
face
of
him
and
big
gold
and
then
you
know
what
he
was
he
was
a
great
but
where
did
he
come
from
you
might
know
from
the
high
cheek
bones
and
the
eyes
that
were
on
a
slant
as
it
were
that
it
was
an
eastern
man
was
in
it
it
might
be
java
and
it
might
be
borneo
or
it
might
be
the
strange
country
of
japan
and
there
were
a
couple
of
strange
occurrences
in
the
the
indian
juggler
was
being
baited
by
the
fighting
men
as
people
will
be
after
poking
coarse
fun
at
a
foreigner
the
slim
hindu
fellow
taking
it
at
all
well
he
was
looking
with
eyes
like
gimlets
at
a
big
bullock
of
a
soldier
that
was
leading
the
tormenters
show
me
something
would
surprise
me
he
was
ordering
be
damned
to
this
old
woman
entertainment
says
he
as
a
magician
says
he
you
the
worst
i
ever
saw
if
you
a
magician
says
he
i
a
rabbit
and
there
was
a
roar
at
that
because
he
was
known
to
be
a
very
brave
man
show
me
a
magic
trick
says
he
says
the
hindu
maybe
you
wish
you
had
seen
it
be
damned
to
that
says
the
big
fellow
look
at
this
man
well
the
hindu
told
the
room
look
at
him
well
he
throws
a
handful
of
powder
in
the
fire
and
chants
in
his
foreign
language
a
cloud
of
white
smoke
arises
from
the
fire
he
makes
a
pass
before
it
and
lo
and
behold
ye
it
a
screen
against
the
wall
and
there
a
great
commotion
of
shadows
on
the
screen
and
suddenly
you
see
what
it
all
about
it
a
platform
and
a
man
kneeling
with
his
head
on
the
block
you
do
see
who
it
is
but
you
get
chilled
and
suddenly
there
a
headsman
in
a
red
cloak
and
a
red
mask
and
the
ax
swings
and
falls
the
head
pops
off
and
the
body
falls
limp
and
the
head
rolls
down
the
platform
and
stops
and
you
see
it
the
head
of
the
fellow
who
wanted
to
see
something
and
it
in
the
grisly
grin
of
death
there
your
latter
end
for
you
says
the
conjurer
you
wanted
to
see
something
i
hope
you
content
the
big
fellow
turns
white
gulps
gives
a
bellow
and
makes
a
rush
but
the
conjurer
is
there
nor
his
screen
nor
anything
everybody
in
the
room
was
white
and
shaken
all
but
the
he
just
tamps
his
pipe
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
smokes
on
he
does
even
take
a
drink
from
his
glass
and
a
little
while
later
an
irish
chieftain
walks
in
he
poor
and
ragged
and
very
thin
you
might
know
he
been
fighting
the
heathen
for
the
holy
sepulchre
and
so
entitled
to
respect
no
matter
what
his
condition
and
behind
him
are
five
clansmen
as
ragged
as
he
but
a
big
german
trooper
rolls
up
and
what
are
you
says
the
big
burly
fellow
a
gentleman
i
hope
says
the
ragged
chief
is
yourself
that
says
it
laughs
the
german
trooper
the
chieftain
snicks
the
knife
from
his
armpit
and
sticks
him
in
the
jugular
as
neat
as
be
damned
you
might
take
that
out
kevin
beg
the
irish
chief
points
to
the
killed
man
and
throw
it
in
the
canal
somebody
might
stumble
over
it
and
bark
their
shins
now
this
as
you
can
conceive
roused
a
powerful
commotion
in
the
room
they
were
all
on
their
feet
captains
and
mariners
and
cheering
or
grumbling
and
arguing
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
matter
all
but
the
who
saw
it
all
and
he
never
blinked
an
eyelid
never
even
missed
a
draw
of
the
pipe
and
then
marco
polo
knew
him
to
be
a
chinaman
because
as
all
the
world
knows
chinamen
are
never
surprised
at
anything
chapter
iv
so
marco
polo
goes
over
and
salutes
him
politely
i
wonder
if
you
mind
my
sitting
down
by
you
for
a
while
he
says
i
perceive
you
from
china
the
waves
him
politely
to
his
place
i
from
china
he
smiles
you
guessed
right
is
it
long
since
you
been
in
china
well
that
depends
upon
what
you
call
long
says
the
captain
if
you
mean
time
it
one
thing
if
you
mean
voyage
it
another
for
you
got
to
take
into
account
says
he
adverse
winds
roundabout
turns
to
avoid
currents
possible
delays
to
have
the
ship
scraped
free
from
the
parasite
life
that
does
be
attaching
itself
to
the
strakes
time
spent
in
barter
and
trade
other
matters
too
the
attacks
of
pirates
princes
who
do
want
you
to
be
leaving
their
ports
with
a
good
cargo
in
your
hold
sickness
loss
of
sails
and
masts
repairs
to
the
ship
it
was
a
short
journey
and
it
was
a
long
one
it
will
be
a
long
ways
to
china
i
thinking
i
can
tell
you
how
long
it
is
from
china
to
here
and
you
can
reverse
that
and
you
will
get
a
fair
idea
of
how
long
it
is
from
here
to
china
i
left
zeitoon
with
a
cargo
of
porcelain
for
japan
and
traded
it
for
and
from
japan
i
went
to
chamba
to
lay
in
a
store
of
chessmen
and
and
from
chamba
i
sailed
to
java
which
is
the
greatest
island
in
the
world
java
is
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
chamba
south
and
southeast
and
it
took
me
four
months
sailing
but
a
can
not
pass
java
by
for
it
is
the
chief
place
for
black
pepper
nutmegs
spikenard
galingale
cubebs
doves
and
all
the
spices
that
grow
and
i
stopped
at
various
small
islands
from
there
until
i
came
to
basma
which
is
the
island
of
the
unicorns
and
there
we
trade
in
pygmies
which
ignorant
people
think
are
human
folk
they
are
just
a
wee
monkey
with
all
the
hair
plucked
out
except
the
hair
of
the
beard
there
is
great
money
in
them
i
stopped
at
sumatra
for
cocoanuts
and
toddy
and
just
for
water
at
dragoian
dragoian
is
not
a
good
city
it
is
filled
with
sorcerers
who
have
tattooed
faces
at
lambri
i
put
in
for
the
sago
you
buy
from
the
hairy
men
with
tails
son
never
stop
at
the
isle
of
andaman
the
men
there
have
faces
like
dogs
they
are
a
cruel
generation
and
eat
every
one
they
can
catch
i
could
tell
you
a
story
but
i
would
not
spoil
this
fine
spring
night
go
rather
to
the
island
of
ceylon
and
see
the
king
ruby
which
is
the
greatest
jewel
in
the
world
i
stopped
there
and
at
coromandel
for
the
pearls
the
divers
go
down
in
the
sea
for
and
there
are
no
clothes
on
that
island
so
that
every
one
goes
naked
as
a
fish
and
there
is
the
shrine
of
saint
thomas
i
was
there
gujarat
tana
i
stopped
there
the
male
and
female
islands
i
put
into
for
ambergris
svestra
which
is
full
of
magicians
i
was
there
too
madagascar
and
zanzibar
where
they
live
on
camel
flesh
i
was
there
and
from
zanzibar
i
came
north
to
abyssinia
because
i
had
to
get
an
ostrich
there
for
the
king
of
siam
and
there
was
a
letter
and
a
parcel
for
the
sultan
of
egypt
so
i
went
to
cairo
i
had
a
month
on
my
hands
so
i
thought
i
run
over
and
see
venice
because
it
a
hobby
of
mine
you
might
say
to
see
the
world
now
let
me
reckon
four
and
three
makes
seven
and
four
more
are
eleven
and
six
are
seventeen
and
let
us
say
nine
with
that
and
you
have
and
the
month
i
forgetting
on
the
rocks
of
aden
is
and
a
week
here
and
a
week
there
for
bad
winds
and
such
like
it
would
be
safe
to
put
that
at
three
months
so
it
two
years
and
a
half
since
i
left
china
you
never
says
young
marco
met
anybody
in
china
by
the
name
of
polo
china
a
bigger
place
nor
you
would
imagine
laddie
there
half
a
hundred
million
people
there
these
were
foreigners
marco
explained
traders
they
were
at
the
court
of
the
great
khan
polo
polo
well
now
i
think
i
heard
of
them
was
one
of
them
a
big
man
with
a
great
eye
for
a
horse
and
a
great
eye
for
a
woman
that
would
be
my
uncle
matthew
for
god
sake
and
was
the
other
a
cold
dark
man
a
good
judge
of
a
jewel
and
a
grand
judge
of
a
sword
my
father
nicholas
polo
for
god
sake
you
the
son
of
one
and
the
nephew
of
the
other
did
you
know
them
ah
laddie
how
would
i
be
knowing
people
like
that
sure
great
folks
high
in
the
esteem
of
the
grand
khan
and
i
only
a
poor
sailorman
but
you
heard
of
them
i
heard
of
them
they
were
in
good
health
and
i
heard
they
were
on
their
way
home
though
they
would
travel
overland
and
not
risk
the
great
dangers
of
the
sea
i
suppose
if
they
go
back
to
china
be
going
with
them
i
do
know
says
marco
polo
you
ought
to
see
china
it
a
great
country
a
beautiful
country
it
would
have
to
be
very
great
and
beautiful
says
marco
polo
to
the
greatness
and
the
beauty
that
are
here
you
think
i
running
down
your
country
mister
says
he
but
for
greatness
where
is
the
beating
of
venice
in
this
day
what
struck
constantinople
like
a
thunderbolt
but
the
mailed
hand
of
venice
when
the
barbary
corsairs
roamed
the
seven
seas
so
that
it
was
no
more
safe
for
a
merchant
vessel
to
be
sailing
than
for
a
babe
to
be
walking
through
a
wild
jungle
it
was
venice
who
accepted
the
challenge
and
made
the
great
sea
as
peaceful
as
the
grand
canal
who
humbled
proud
genoa
and
hurled
the
saracen
from
saint
john
of
acre
walls
venice
and
as
for
magnificence
the
retinue
of
our
doge
when
he
goes
to
marry
the
sea
with
a
ring
it
makes
the
court
of
lorenzo
seem
like
a
huckster
train
it
is
a
crowning
city
and
as
for
beauty
sir
went
on
marco
polo
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
like
san
marco
and
it
ablaze
in
the
setting
sun
and
the
great
pillars
before
it
rising
in
tongues
of
flame
and
was
there
ever
in
all
time
anything
like
the
grand
canal
at
the
dusk
of
day
and
the
torches
beginning
to
show
like
fireflies
and
the
lap
of
the
water
and
stringed
music
and
the
great
barges
going
by
like
swans
now
a
captain
of
war
now
a
great
gracious
lady
and
the
moon
does
be
rising
you
sailed
all
the
way
from
china
and
seen
strange
and
beautiful
things
but
i
remember
one
summer
day
when
i
took
out
my
little
and
went
out
on
the
water
to
compose
a
poem
for
a
lady
and
the
water
was
blue
oh
as
blue
as
the
sky
self
and
the
sands
of
the
lido
were
silver
and
the
water
shuffled
gently
over
them
as
gently
as
a
child
little
feet
and
there
was
a
clump
of
there
so
green
as
to
be
black
and
there
alighted
before
it
a
great
scarlet
egyptian
bird
and
the
beauty
of
that
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
so
that
i
thought
of
nuns
in
their
cells
and
barefoot
friars
in
the
hollow
lands
and
they
striving
for
paradise
what
did
i
care
about
paradise
a
venetian
i
so
why
should
i
want
to
go
to
china
you
have
made
a
great
case
for
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
venice
says
the
it
is
lovely
surely
says
he
filling
his
pipe
but
finer
poets
nor
you
my
lad
says
he
lighting
it
have
tried
to
describe
the
grace
and
beauty
of
and
says
he
taking
a
draw
have
failed
is
a
beautiful
name
it
is
like
two
notes
plucked
on
a
harp
and
it
must
be
a
wonderful
place
surely
if
great
poets
can
not
describe
it
it
is
not
a
place
said
the
captain
it
a
girl
as
for
women
venice
venice
be
damned
said
the
not
in
venice
not
in
all
the
world
is
there
the
like
for
grace
or
beauty
of
they
call
her
golden
bells
he
says
is
she
a
marco
asked
she
is
not
a
says
the
she
is
the
daughter
of
kubla
the
great
khan
a
cold
and
beautiful
princess
says
marco
polo
she
is
not
a
cold
and
beautiful
princess
says
the
she
is
warm
as
the
sun
in
early
june
and
she
may
be
beautiful
and
a
princess
but
we
all
think
of
her
as
golden
bells
the
little
girl
in
the
chinese
garden
did
you
ever
see
her
says
marco
eagerly
tell
me
i
saw
her
before
i
left
says
the
i
was
at
the
palace
of
chagannor
says
he
seeing
of
the
chief
of
the
stewards
was
there
anything
i
could
get
for
him
and
i
in
foreign
parts
and
as
i
was
being
rowed
back
along
the
river
by
my
ten
brawny
sailormen
what
did
i
pass
but
the
garden
of
golden
bells
and
there
she
was
by
the
a
little
brown
slip
of
a
girl
in
green
coat
and
trousers
with
a
flower
in
her
dark
hair
and
i
lower
my
head
in
reverence
as
we
pass
by
but
i
hear
her
low
merry
voice
by
reason
of
which
they
call
her
golden
bells
master
of
the
vessel
she
calls
do
you
go
and
the
sailors
back
water
with
a
swish
and
i
stand
up
respectfully
for
all
she
is
only
a
slip
of
a
girl
go
to
foreign
parts
golden
bells
i
tell
her
far
and
dangerous
places
into
the
indian
ocean
to
the
island
of
unicorns
and
to
the
land
where
men
eat
men
hope
you
come
back
safe
master
of
the
vessel
she
says
hope
you
have
a
good
voyage
and
come
back
safe
it
must
be
a
dreadful
strain
on
your
people
to
think
of
you
so
far
away
all
this
wide
land
i
tell
her
is
none
to
worry
about
me
i
have
neither
chick
nor
child
bells
will
worry
about
you
then
she
said
you
in
the
hazards
of
the
sea
and
take
this
flower
for
luck
and
she
gave
me
the
flower
from
her
hair
let
it
bring
you
luck
against
the
anger
of
the
ocean
and
the
enemies
all
men
have
and
let
me
know
when
you
are
back
because
i
be
worried
about
a
man
of
china
and
him
in
danger
on
the
open
sea
and
was
that
a
wonderful
thing
from
a
daughter
of
kubla
to
me
a
poor
the
son
of
the
king
of
siam
came
to
woo
her
with
a
hundred
princes
on
a
hundred
elephants
but
she
would
have
him
do
wish
to
be
a
queen
she
told
her
father
could
i
be
a
queen
i
am
only
golden
bells
nor
would
she
have
anything
to
say
to
the
prince
of
the
land
of
darkness
who
came
to
her
with
sea
ivory
and
pale
arctic
gold
sun
of
china
is
in
my
heart
and
you
would
have
me
go
up
into
the
great
coldness
to
shiver
and
die
so
she
remains
in
her
garden
by
the
lake
of
cranes
with
li
po
the
great
poet
him
they
call
the
drinker
of
wine
to
make
songs
for
her
and
the
sanang
tung
chih
the
great
magician
to
perform
wonders
for
her
when
she
is
wearied
and
bulagan
her
nurse
to
take
her
to
her
heart
when
she
is
sad
and
sad
she
is
a
lot
of
the
time
they
tell
me
she
sits
in
her
garden
in
the
dusk
playing
her
lute
and
singing
the
song
of
the
willow
branches
which
is
the
saddest
in
the
world
and
why
she
should
be
singing
a
sad
is
a
mystery
for
her
soft
brown
beauty
is
the
flower
of
the
world
for
there
would
be
no
lack
of
suitors
for
her
nor
is
she
the
one
to
refuse
love
the
only
thing
i
make
of
it
is
that
the
right
hour
has
come
the
beauty
of
venice
jumps
to
your
eyes
but
the
beauty
of
this
pulls
at
your
heart
little
brown
golden
bells
in
her
chinese
garden
singing
the
song
of
the
willow
branches
at
the
close
of
day
is
that
not
better
nor
venice
but
he
got
no
word
out
of
marco
polo
sitting
with
his
chin
cupped
in
his
hands
and
that
was
the
finest
answer
at
all
at
all
chapter
v
the
times
went
by
and
marco
polo
busied
himself
with
his
daily
affairs
keeping
track
of
the
galleasses
with
merchandise
to
strange
ports
buying
presents
for
refractory
governors
who
care
for
foreign
trade
in
their
domains
getting
wisdom
from
the
old
clerks
and
knowledge
from
the
mariners
in
the
main
acting
as
the
son
of
a
great
house
while
the
heads
of
it
were
away
you
would
think
that
he
would
have
forgotten
what
the
of
china
told
him
about
golden
bells
what
with
work
and
sport
and
other
women
near
him
you
would
think
that
would
drop
out
of
his
memory
like
an
old
rime
but
it
stuck
there
as
an
old
rime
sometimes
sticks
and
by
dint
of
thinking
he
had
her
fast
now
in
his
mind
so
fast
so
clear
so
full
of
life
that
she
might
be
some
one
he
had
seen
an
hour
ago
or
was
going
to
see
an
hour
from
now
he
would
think
of
the
now
merry
now
sad
eyes
of
her
and
the
soft
sweet
voice
of
her
by
reason
of
which
they
called
her
golden
bells
and
the
dusky
little
face
and
the
hair
like
black
silk
and
the
splotch
of
the
red
flower
in
it
she
was
as
distinct
to
him
as
the
five
fingers
on
his
hand
it
was
only
she
was
clear
in
his
mind
eye
but
she
was
inside
of
him
closer
than
his
heart
she
was
there
when
the
sun
rose
so
he
would
be
saying
it
a
grand
day
is
in
it
surely
golden
bells
she
was
there
in
the
dim
counting
house
and
he
going
over
in
the
great
intricate
ledgers
the
clerks
do
be
posting
carefully
with
quills
of
the
gray
goose
so
that
he
would
be
saying
i
wonder
where
this
is
and
that
is
sure
i
had
my
finger
on
it
only
a
moment
ago
golden
bells
and
when
the
dusk
was
falling
and
the
bats
came
out
and
the
quiet
of
christ
was
over
everything
and
the
swallows
flew
low
on
the
great
canals
she
would
be
beside
him
and
never
a
word
would
he
say
to
her
so
near
to
him
would
she
be
and
she
wrought
strangeness
between
him
and
the
women
he
knew
the
great
grave
lady
with
the
large
pale
mouth
her
that
was
of
his
mind
and
the
little
black
with
the
eager
red
mouth
her
that
was
closer
than
mind
or
heart
to
him
so
that
the
first
found
fault
with
his
poetry
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
marco
polo
and
there
was
a
touch
of
temper
in
her
voice
but
these
poems
of
yours
show
me
you
your
mind
on
your
subject
would
you
mind
telling
me
when
i
had
bound
black
hair
she
says
and
you
say
my
bosom
is
like
two
little
russet
apples
now
a
regular
poet
once
compared
it
to
two
great
silver
cups
and
that
was
a
good
comparison
though
in
truth
she
says
he
knew
as
little
about
it
as
you
and
my
hands
are
not
like
soft
eastern
flowers
they
like
lilies
i
do
know
where
you
do
be
getting
these
eastern
comparisons
she
says
but
i
do
like
them
tell
me
pretty
boy
she
looks
suspicious
you
have
been
taking
any
of
the
strange
egyptian
drugs
the
dark
people
do
be
selling
in
the
dim
shops
on
the
quiet
canals
look
out
pretty
boy
look
out
and
the
little
grumbled
when
he
was
gone
i
do
know
what
wrong
with
him
says
she
or
maybe
it
something
wrong
with
myself
but
this
delicate
love
is
all
it
cracked
up
to
be
it
all
right
in
books
she
says
and
it
a
grand
sight
and
the
players
doing
it
but
i
like
a
hug
she
says
would
put
the
breath
out
of
you
and
a
kiss
she
says
you
could
feel
in
the
soles
of
your
feet
and
she
lay
awake
and
grumbled
let
him
be
taking
his
courting
to
those
as
favor
it
says
she
it
not
my
kind
and
she
grumbled
through
the
lonely
night
i
wonder
where
my
husband
is
now
she
said
and
was
i
the
foolish
girl
to
be
sending
him
off
sure
he
drank
like
a
fish
and
beat
me
something
cruel
but
he
was
a
rare
lover
and
the
mood
on
him
sure
a
woman
never
knows
when
she
well
off
says
she
and
marco
polo
did
miss
them
any
more
nor
you
miss
an
old
overcoat
and
the
winter
past
all
his
mind
was
on
was
the
golden
bells
of
china
and
he
thought
long
until
his
uncle
and
father
came
so
that
he
could
be
off
with
them
to
the
strange
chinese
land
but
there
no
use
to
me
going
there
says
he
i
could
marry
her
she
would
laugh
at
me
he
says
she
who
refused
the
son
of
the
king
of
siam
with
his
hundred
princes
on
a
hundred
elephants
what
use
would
she
have
for
me
who
no
better
nor
a
peddler
with
his
pack
but
it
would
be
worth
walking
the
world
barefoot
for
to
see
that
little
golden
face
to
hear
the
low
sweet
voice
they
call
golden
bells
they
came
back
in
due
time
his
uncle
matthew
the
red
hairy
man
and
his
father
the
thin
dark
man
who
knew
precious
stones
and
he
told
them
he
wanted
to
go
with
them
when
they
made
their
next
expedition
to
china
we
could
be
using
you
after
your
training
in
trade
says
the
father
but
marco
polo
would
take
no
interest
in
barter
sure
you
better
come
along
says
his
uncle
matthew
there
great
sport
to
be
had
on
the
road
kissing
and
courting
the
foreign
women
and
not
a
word
of
language
between
you
barring
a
smile
and
a
laugh
i
have
no
interest
in
the
foreign
women
uncle
matthew
then
it
the
horses
you
been
hearing
about
the
fine
arab
horses
faster
nor
the
wind
and
the
little
persian
ponies
they
do
be
playing
polo
on
and
the
grand
tatar
hunters
that
can
jump
the
heighth
of
a
man
and
they
as
a
goat
ah
the
horses
the
bonny
horses
ah
sure
uncle
matthew
is
little
i
know
of
horses
sure
i
know
all
about
boats
racing
and
trade
and
war
boats
but
a
horse
is
not
kin
to
me
then
what
the
hell
the
use
of
your
going
to
china
ah
sure
that
the
question
i
asking
myself
uncle
matthew
but
i
have
to
go
i
do
so
there
is
something
calling
me
uncle
matthew
a
bell
in
my
ear
father
brother
and
there
a
ringing
bell
in
my
heart
chapter
vi
i
shall
now
tell
you
how
it
came
about
that
marco
polo
went
to
china
with
his
uncle
and
father
though
he
had
no
eye
for
a
bargain
or
interest
in
courting
foreign
women
or
sense
of
horses
now
as
you
may
know
this
was
a
great
religious
time
the
crusaders
feeling
shame
that
the
sepulchre
of
the
lord
jesus
should
be
in
saracen
hands
had
come
with
horse
foot
and
artillery
to
palestine
to
give
tribute
of
arms
to
him
who
had
died
for
them
on
the
bitter
tree
and
great
feats
were
performed
and
grand
battles
won
and
kings
became
saints
like
louis
of
france
and
saints
became
kings
like
baldwin
of
constantinople
mighty
wonders
were
seen
and
miracles
performed
so
that
people
said
now
will
be
the
second
coming
of
christ
and
the
end
of
the
world
and
a
great
desire
came
on
the
christian
people
to
tell
the
truth
of
christ
to
the
strange
and
foreign
peoples
of
the
world
so
that
every
day
out
of
jerusalem
you
would
see
friars
hitting
the
road
some
of
them
to
confront
the
wizards
of
the
land
of
darkness
and
some
to
argue
theology
with
the
old
lamas
of
tibet
and
some
to
convert
the
sunny
southern
islands
where
the
young
women
do
be
letting
down
their
hair
and
the
men
do
be
forgetting
god
for
them
and
all
over
the
world
there
was
spreading
a
great
rumor
that
the
truth
of
all
things
was
at
last
known
even
kubla
khan
had
heard
of
it
far
off
in
china
and
he
had
charged
the
uncle
and
father
of
marco
with
a
message
to
the
pope
of
rome
let
the
pope
be
sending
some
theologians
to
his
court
and
they
argue
the
matter
out
and
if
he
was
satisfied
that
this
new
religion
was
the
true
religion
then
he
turn
christian
and
tell
his
people
to
turn
christian
too
and
let
them
be
bringing
back
some
of
the
oil
of
the
lamp
which
burns
in
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
and
is
a
cure
for
all
the
ills
in
the
world
and
when
they
came
to
the
city
of
acre
sure
the
pope
was
dead
and
they
waited
a
long
time
but
no
new
pope
was
chosen
so
they
decided
to
go
back
because
they
had
a
good
business
there
and
they
did
want
to
lose
it
and
yet
they
knew
there
be
trouble
with
the
grand
khan
if
they
did
bring
back
the
news
of
the
true
religion
and
people
to
argue
it
i
been
a
long
time
trading
says
nicolo
and
it
a
queer
thing
but
the
more
trading
you
do
the
less
religion
you
have
the
arguing
of
religion
would
not
come
easy
to
me
and
i
be
up
against
experts
i
not
the
man
for
it
says
he
how
about
you
matthew
oh
sure
they
never
listen
to
me
matthew
laughs
me
that
drank
with
them
and
deludhered
their
women
and
gambled
until
i
left
them
nothing
but
the
sweat
of
their
brows
i
be
a
great
one
to
preach
religion
to
them
why
man
they
laugh
at
me
but
i
tell
you
what
nicolas
there
a
bishop
in
negropont
and
i
know
where
he
lives
and
i
know
his
house
and
everything
what
do
you
say
nicolas
we
just
throw
a
bag
over
his
head
and
tie
him
on
a
horse
oh
sure
he
give
grand
discourses
to
the
great
khan
have
sense
matthew
have
sense
you
always
too
rough
always
ready
to
end
an
argument
with
a
knife
or
just
lift
what
you
want
have
sense
man
you
ca
kidnap
a
bishop
like
you
kidnap
a
woman
well
i
do
see
why
not
says
matthew
it
would
be
easier
too
because
a
woman
will
scratch
like
a
wildcat
but
if
you
set
against
it
i
wo
do
it
he
says
well
then
how
about
young
marco
my
sound
man
matthew
my
bully
fellow
sure
you
were
never
at
a
loss
yet
young
marco
it
is
sure
is
the
elegant
idea
there
not
a
man
born
of
woman
better
for
the
job
now
all
the
christian
world
had
gone
religious
and
young
marco
was
no
exception
is
not
only
the
old
that
are
religious
the
young
are
too
but
there
a
difference
the
religion
of
old
men
is
reason
and
translation
the
religion
of
the
young
is
just
a
burning
cloud
the
tragedy
of
the
bitter
tree
is
not
a
symbol
to
them
but
a
reality
and
their
tears
are
not
of
the
spirit
but
of
the
body
too
and
there
are
no
houses
no
compromises
in
a
young
creed
it
swallow
all
or
be
damned
to
you
it
believe
or
be
lost
and
thinking
over
the
little
girl
in
the
chinese
garden
there
had
come
into
marco
heart
a
thought
past
enduring
if
little
golden
bells
did
not
believe
then
little
golden
bells
was
lost
she
might
have
everything
in
this
world
in
this
life
an
emperor
for
a
father
kings
for
suitors
a
great
poet
for
a
minstrel
a
wizard
for
an
entertainer
but
once
the
little
blue
shadow
left
her
body
she
was
lost
forever
and
the
sight
came
to
him
of
little
golden
bells
going
down
the
dim
and
lonely
alleys
of
death
and
weeping
weeping
weeping
her
eyes
would
be
shot
with
panic
and
the
little
mouth
twisted
and
the
little
flowery
hands
twitching
at
each
other
and
it
would
be
cold
there
for
her
who
was
so
warm
and
it
would
be
dark
there
for
her
who
loved
light
and
the
golden
bells
of
her
voice
would
be
lost
in
the
whistling
and
clanging
of
the
stars
as
they
swung
by
in
their
orbits
he
to
be
in
the
great
delight
of
paradise
and
she
to
be
in
the
maze
between
the
worlds
what
tragedy
kings
might
bring
her
presents
a
husband
might
bring
her
happiness
but
if
he
could
only
bring
her
salvation
if
he
could
only
tell
her
of
the
bitter
tree
the
body
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
mattered
little
all
the
beauty
in
the
world
could
not
endure
more
than
its
appointed
span
helen
was
dust
now
and
deirdre
nothing
what
had
become
of
the
beauty
of
semiramis
alexander
darling
and
cleopatra
who
loved
the
great
proconsul
and
bathsheba
for
whom
david
of
the
psalms
fell
from
grace
and
balkis
queen
of
sheba
with
her
apes
ivory
and
peacocks
dust
and
ashes
dust
and
ashes
and
scheherazade
was
but
a
strange
sad
sound
beauty
increased
and
waned
like
the
moon
a
little
shadow
around
the
eyes
a
little
crinkle
in
the
neck
the
backs
of
the
hands
stiffening
like
parchment
dust
and
ashes
dust
and
ashes
but
the
little
blue
shadow
would
glow
like
an
easter
morning
or
it
would
be
a
poor
lonely
unlit
shadow
in
the
cold
gloom
of
the
clanging
worlds
poor
golden
bells
poor
little
weeping
golden
bells
if
he
could
only
tell
her
about
the
bitter
tree
and
then
what
happens
but
his
uncle
matthew
claps
him
on
the
back
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
china
marco
markeen
says
he
and
preach
religion
to
the
benighted
people
how
did
you
know
uncle
matthew
how
did
i
know
what
that
i
wanted
to
go
to
china
and
preach
religion
to
the
the
people
well
if
that
does
beat
banagher
says
matthew
polo
and
banagher
beats
the
devil
tell
me
did
you
ever
hear
an
old
tune
called
and
go
and
so
the
three
of
them
leave
upon
their
journey
but
at
layas
where
the
king
of
armenia
had
his
castle
they
heard
of
the
election
of
a
new
pope
so
they
came
back
to
acre
to
get
his
instructions
and
blessing
chapter
vii
the
pope
said
a
grand
mass
for
them
and
at
the
gospel
he
enters
the
pulpit
a
burly
figure
of
a
man
with
sad
eyes
the
blessing
of
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
be
with
you
and
about
you
amen
it
is
not
to
you
nicolo
polo
that
i
wish
to
speak
nor
to
you
matthew
polo
for
neither
of
you
are
my
ambassadors
to
the
great
khan
merchant
and
sportsmen
i
honor
you
and
you
have
my
blessing
but
you
have
no
hopes
of
mine
the
dirty
diversions
of
the
world
are
between
your
eyes
and
glory
said
he
it
only
myself
an
old
and
sorrowful
man
and
this
child
a
young
and
hopeful
one
can
understand
old
men
having
sight
of
visions
and
young
men
dreaming
dreams
now
in
the
matter
of
converting
the
great
khan
and
his
numerous
millions
first
let
wisdom
speak
i
have
little
hopes
he
wants
to
be
argued
into
it
you
see
religion
is
not
a
matter
of
argument
it
is
a
wisdom
that
surpasses
wisdom
it
drifts
in
men
souls
as
the
foggy
dew
comes
unbidden
to
the
trees
it
is
born
before
our
soul
as
the
horned
moon
is
born
before
our
eyes
and
now
my
child
you
might
say
is
the
use
of
sending
me
to
china
if
he
knows
i
can
not
bring
these
millions
into
the
fold
my
dear
son
there
is
the
wisdom
surpassing
wisdom
a
great
and
noble
thought
must
not
die
things
of
the
spirit
we
can
not
reckon
as
a
reckons
his
crops
there
is
a
folk
on
the
marches
of
europe
and
they
are
ever
going
into
battle
and
they
always
fall
their
results
are
nothing
but
their
name
and
their
glory
will
endure
forever
my
dear
son
god
has
put
wisdom
in
my
head
and
beauty
into
yours
wisdom
is
needed
for
the
governance
of
this
world
but
beauty
is
needed
for
its
existence
in
arid
deserts
there
is
no
life
birds
do
not
sing
in
the
dark
of
night
show
me
a
waste
country
and
i
show
you
a
brutal
people
no
faith
can
live
that
is
not
beautiful
the
beauty
god
has
put
in
your
heart
child
you
must
always
keep
how
much
i
think
of
it
i
tell
you
i
an
old
man
now
an
old
and
broken
man
and
in
a
few
years
i
stand
before
my
master
have
you
seen
on
my
earth
he
ask
me
who
followed
st
peter
lord
i
tell
him
seen
mighty
things
i
seen
the
bridegroom
leave
his
bride
and
the
king
his
kingdom
the
huckster
leave
his
booth
and
the
reaper
drop
his
hook
that
they
might
rescue
your
holy
sepulchre
from
pagan
hands
anything
else
he
ask
i
seen
a
young
man
go
out
into
the
desert
and
over
his
head
was
a
star
you
may
think
you
have
failed
child
but
remember
that
in
the
coming
times
your
name
and
fame
will
awaken
beauty
and
many
the
traveler
on
the
hard
road
will
find
his
courage
again
and
he
thinking
of
marco
polo
and
many
the
young
man
will
dream
dreams
and
many
the
old
man
will
see
visions
and
they
reading
the
book
by
the
golden
and
many
the
young
girl
will
give
you
love
and
you
dead
for
centuries
but
for
this
you
must
keep
your
dream
now
you
think
it
the
queer
pope
i
am
to
be
telling
you
things
like
this
instead
of
demanding
converts
but
the
wisdom
that
surpasses
wisdom
comes
to
you
with
the
annointing
of
the
oil
knew
a
man
in
christ
above
fourteen
years
ago
writes
saint
paul
whether
in
the
body
i
can
not
tell
or
whether
out
of
the
body
i
can
not
tell
god
knoweth
that
he
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
which
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
utter
now
you
see
there
is
a
wisdom
surpassing
wisdom
and
it
is
out
of
this
fount
of
wisdom
i
am
drawing
when
i
speak
to
you
these
words
child
i
will
not
keep
you
any
longer
only
to
say
this
and
this
is
the
chiefest
thing
never
let
your
dream
be
taken
from
you
keep
it
unspotted
from
the
world
in
darkness
and
in
tribulation
it
will
go
with
you
as
a
friend
but
in
wealth
and
power
hold
fast
to
it
for
then
is
danger
let
not
the
mists
of
the
world
the
gay
diversions
the
little
trifles
draw
you
from
glory
remember
si
oblitus
fuero
tui
jerusalem
if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
oblivioni
detur
dextera
mea
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
adhaereat
lingua
mea
faucibus
meis
si
non
meminero
tui
if
i
do
not
remember
thee
let
my
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
si
non

jerusalem
in

laetitiae
meae
if
i
prefer
not
jerusalem
above
my
chief
joy
i
shall
now
send
a
prayer
to
heaven
he
said
to
keep
you
safe
in
the
strange
foreign
ways
to
protect
you
against
wind
and
tempest
against
pestilence
and
sudden
death
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
him
who
goes
up
and
down
the
world
for
the
ruin
of
souls
and
he
turned
to
the
high
altar
again
and
now
you
hear
his
voice
loud
and
powerful
and
now
low
and
secret
and
the
bell
struck
and
the
acolyte
intoned
the
responses
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
turned
and
spread
forth
his
hands

let
you
go
now

chapter
viii
and
so
they
set
forth
with
their
great
train
of
red
snarling
camels
and
little
patient
donkeys
and
slender
nervous
horses
toward
the
rising
sun
behind
them
the
green
hills
of
palestine
died
out
as
a
rainbow
dies
out
and
now
there
was
sand
before
them
and
now
bleak
mountains
and
by
day
the
wind
was
swift
and
hot
and
by
night
it
was
black
and
cold
and
moons
were
born
and
died
and
they
passed
through
the
land
of
the
king
of
armenia
and
they
passed
ararat
the
mountain
where
noah
brought
his
ark
to
anchor
and
where
it
still
is
and
where
it
can
be
seen
still
but
can
not
be
reached
so
cold
and
high
and
terrible
is
that
mountain
and
they
passed
ruined
babel
that
was
built
of
nimrod
the
first
king
of
the
world
and
now
is
desolation
they
passed
it
on
a
waning
moon
and
out
of
the
ruins
the
dragons
came
and
hissed
at
them
and
strange
obscene
birds
flapped
their
wings
in
the
air
and
cawed
and
pecked
at
them
and
over
the
desert
the
satyr
called
unto
her
mate
and
they
passed
through
the
kingdom
of
georgia
whose
kings
are
born
with
the
mark
of
an
eagle
on
their
right
shoulder
they
passed
through
persia
where
the
magicians
worship
fire
and
they
passed
through
the
city
of
saba
where
sleep
the
three
magi
who
came
to
worship
at
bethlehem
and
their
names
were
kaspar
balthlasar
and
melchior
and
they
passed
through
camadi
where
great
ruins
are
and
robbers
roam
through
the
magical
darkness
and
they
passed
northward
of
the
perilous
valley
where
the
devil
head
is
in
black
stone
and
that
is
one
of
the
nine
entrances
to
hell
and
passed
the
valley
of
the
cockadrills
where
there
are
serpents
five
fathoms
in
length
and
passed
the
valley
of
cruel
women
who
have
precious
stones
in
place
of
eyes
and
they
went
through
the
dismal
desert
where
no
stream
sang
and
in
the
desert
they
passed
the
trees
of
the
sun
and
moon
which
speak
with
the
voices
of
men
and
it
was
from
the
speaking
tree
that
alexander
heard
of
his
death
and
it
was
near
there
that
he
and
darius
fought
and
they
passed
the
arbre
sec
the
dry
tree
which
has
a
green
bark
on
one
side
and
white
on
the
other
and
there
are
no
trees
within
a
hundred
miles
of
that
tree
and
it
is
sprung
from
the
staff
of
adam
and
they
passed
through
balkh
the
mother
of
cities
and
they
passed
through
tailian
where
the
great
salt
mountains
are
and
they
passed
through
badashan
where
the
mountains
of
the
rubies
are
and
they
passed
through
kashmir
whose
women
are
very
beautiful
and
whose
magicians
weave
the
strongest
spells
in
the
world
and
moons
were
born
and
died
and
they
came
to
alamoot
the
fortess
of
senex
de
monte
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
the
king
of
the
assassins
the
greatest
wizard
of
all
time
now
this
is
the
tale
of
the
old
man
the
mountain
whenever
within
his
dominions
there
was
a
fine
young
horseman
the
old
man
would
put
a
spell
on
him
and
draw
him
to
the
castle
of
alamoot
and
outside
of
the
castle
sleep
would
come
on
him
and
when
he
woke
up
he
would
be
inside
the
castle
in
the
wonderful
gardens
and
they
tell
him
he
was
dead
and
in
paradise
and
paradise
it
would
be
for
him
what
with
the
lovely
women
and
the
great
playing
on
the
flutes
the
birds
singing
and
the
sun
shining
the
crystal
rivers
and
the
flowers
of
the
world
and
after
a
while
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
would
call
for
him
and
tell
him
he
was
sending
him
back
on
earth
again
on
a
mission
to
punish
and
the
old
man
would
put
sleep
on
him
and
a
knife
in
his
hand
and
when
he
woke
he
would
be
outside
the
castle
of
alamoot
and
he
would
start
on
his
mission
and
when
he
came
back
he
would
be
readmitted
to
paradise
and
if
he
did
come
back
there
were
others
to
take
his
place
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
always
kept
one
hundred
and
one
assassins
and
four
hundred
and
four
women
to
tend
them
now
when
the
caravan
of
the
polos
had
come
to
rest
for
the
day
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
put
out
white
not
black
magic
and
he
drew
marco
polo
to
the
castle
as
a
magnet
draws
a
needle
and
marco
polo
galloped
up
to
the
castle
in
the
waning
moon
and
the
old
man
looked
down
on
him
from
the
battlements
and
stroked
his
long
white
beard
do
you
know
me
marco
polo
i
know
you
and
i
have
no
fear
of
you
old
man
of
the
mountain
and
why
have
you
no
fear
of
me
marco
polo
because
the
cross
of
the
lord
jesus
is
between
me
and
harm
because
it
protects
me
night
and
day
i
know
eesa
said
the
old
man
he
was
a
great
prophet
but
whether
he
would
have
protected
you
from
me
we
will
differ
about
that
i
often
thought
of
you
marco
polo
and
you
coming
this
way
i
could
have
used
you
in
my
work
of
keeping
the
kings
and
chieftains
of
the
world
in
fear
and
subjection
then
why
am
i
in
your
garden
old
man
of
the
mountain
the
four
most
beautiful
women
in
the
world
are
in
my
garden
there
is
a
tall
woman
and
she
is
fairer
and
more
adroit
than
lilith
who
was
before
eve
and
there
is
a
tall
blond
woman
and
she
is
like
a
queen
and
there
is
a
slim
woman
and
she
is
like
an
idol
in
a
shrine
and
there
is
a
little
woman
and
she
is
like
a
child
but
none
of
those
women
could
make
you
believe
you
were
in
paradise
while
there
a
face
in
your
heart
not
the
cross
of
the
lord
jesus
is
between
you
and
me
but
the
face
of
little
golden
bells
of
china
but
i
am
not
going
to
china
to
woo
golden
bells
old
man
of
the
mountain
i
am
going
to
convert
the
men
of
cathay
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
laughed
and
stroked
his
beard
you
had
a
sermon
from
gregory
before
you
came
away
did
he
tell
you
you
were
to
convert
the
men
of
cathay
he
did
not
ali
gregory
a
sound
man
he
knew
you
ca
make
saints
in
a
day
why
child
i
seen
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
i
seen
the
end
of
it
i
seen
the
beginning
in
a
crystal
glass
and
i
seen
the
end
in
a
pool
of
ink
in
a
slave
hand
i
seen
mankind
begin
lower
nor
the
gibbering
ape
and
i
seen
them
end
the
shining
sons
of
god
millions
on
millions
on
millions
of
years
multiplied
unto
dizziness
crawling
infinitesimal
work
overcoming
nature
overcoming
themselves
overcoming
the
princes
of
the
powers
of
darkness
one
of
whom
i
am
but
this
is
too
deep
for
you
marco
polo
now
you
can
go
on
your
way
without
hindrance
from
me
marco
polo
because
of
the
memory
of
an
old
time
when
the
courting
of
a
woman
was
more
to
me
than
the
killing
of
a
man
when
beauty
meant
more
nor
power
let
you
be
on
your
way
marco
polo
while
i
sit
here
a
lonely
old
man
with
wee
soft
ghosts
whispering
to
him
let
you
be
hastening
on
your
way
before
i
remember
i
am
a
prince
of
the
powers
of
darkness
and
should
do
you
harm
chapter
ix
and
so
they
went
on
eastward
ever
eastward
and
the
moons
were
born
grew
waned
and
died
they
passed
through
khotan
where
the
divers
bring
up
jade
from
the
rivers
white
jade
and
black
jade
and
green
jade
veined
with
gold
they
passed
through
carnal
the
shameful
city
whose
women
are
fair
and
wanton
whose
men
are
cuckolds
and
they
passed
through
the
province
of
chitingolos
where
are
the
mountains
of
the
salamanders
they
passed
through
the
city
of
campicha
where
there
are
more
idols
than
men
and
they
passed
through
the
great
city
of
samarkand
where
the
green
stone
is
on
which
timur
throne
was
set
and
were
born
and
died
they
passed
through
tangut
where
the
men
will
not
carry
the
dead
out
through
the
door
of
a
house
but
must
break
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
they
passed
through
kialehta
where
there
are
camels
and
they
passed
through
the
lands
of
prester
john
and
now
they
were
in
the
tatar
lands
there
passed
them
lowing
musk
oxen
there
passed
them
the
wild
asses
of
mongolia
there
passed
them
the
barbarians
with
their
great
tents
on
wheels
there
passed
them
the
savage
idolaters
there
passed
them
the
pretty
women
there
passed
them
huge
abominable
dogs
and
they
came
to
the
town
of
lob
and
a
new
moon
arose
and
they
entered
the
desert
of
the
singing
sands
chapter
x
wherever
they
went
now
was
sand
and
a
dull
haze
that
made
the
sun
look
like
a
copper
coin
and
a
great
silence
fell
on
the
caravan
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
crunch
of
the
camels
pads
and
the
tinkle
of
the
camels
bells
and
no
green
thing
was
seen
and
a
great
terror
fell
on
the
caravan
so
that
one
night
a
third
of
the
caravan
deserted
the
rest
went
on
in
silence
under
the
dull
sun
and
now
they
came
across
a
village
of
white
skeletons
grinning
in
the
silent
sand
and
at
night
there
was
nothing
heard
not
even
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
others
of
the
caravan
deserted
and
others
were
lost
and
now
they
had
come
so
far
into
the
desert
that
they
could
not
return
but
must
keep
on
their
way
and
on
the
fifth
day
they
came
to
the
hill
of
the
drum
and
all
through
the
night
they
could
not
sleep
for
the
booming
of
the
drum
and
some
of
the
caravan
went
mad
there
and
fled
screaming
into
the
waste
and
now
there
was
only
a
great
haze
about
them
and
they
looked
at
one
another
with
terror
saying
were
we
ever
any
place
where
green
was
where
birds
sang
or
there
was
sweet
water
or
maybe
we
are
dead
or
maybe
this
was
all
our
life
and
the
pleasant
towns
and
the
lamplight
in
the
villages
and
the
apricots
in
the
garden
and
our
wives
and
children
maybe
they
were
all
a
dream
that
we
woke
in
the
middle
of
let
us
lie
down
and
sleep
that
we
may
dream
again
but
marco
polo
would
not
let
them
lie
down
for
to
lie
down
was
death
but
he
drove
them
onward
and
again
they
complained
surely
god
never
saw
this
place
that
he
left
it
so
terrible
surely
he
was
never
here
he
was
never
here
and
now
that
their
minds
were
pitched
to
the
height
of
madness
the
warlocks
of
the
desert
took
shape
and
jeered
at
them
and
the
ghosts
flitted
alongside
of
them
and
the
goblins
of
the
gobi
harried
them
from
behind
and
the
sun
was
like
dull
copper
through
the
haze
and
the
moon
like
a
guttering
candle
and
stars
there
were
none
and
when
the
moon
was
at
its
full
they
came
to
the
hill
of
the
bell
and
through
the
night
the
bell
went
gongh
gongh
gongh
until
they
could
feel
it
in
every
fiber
of
their
bodies
and
their
skin
itched
with
it
they
would
stop
their
ears
but
they
would
hear
it
in
the
palms
of
their
hands
and
the
soles
of
their
feet
gongh
gongh
gongh
and
when
they
left
the
hill
of
the
bell
there
were
only
six
of
the
caravan
left
and
a
multitude
of
ghosts
and
the
caravan
plodded
onward
dully
and
now
the
warlocks
of
the
desert
played
another
cruelty
afar
off
they
would
put
a
seeming
of
a
lake
and
the
travelers
would
press
on
gladly
crying
there
is
water
water
god
lives
god
lives
but
there
was
only
sand
and
now
it
would
be
a
green
vision
and
they
would
cry
we
have
come
to
the
edge
of
the
desert
after
the
long
night
dawn
god
lives
god
lives
but
there
would
be
only
sand
sand
and
now
it
would
be
a
city
of
shining
domes
in
the
distance
and
they
would
nudge
one
another
and
croak
there
are
men
there
brother
secure
streets
and
merchants
in
their
booths
people
to
talk
with
and
water
for
our
poor
throats
but
there
would
be
only
sand
sand
sand
and
they
would
cry
like
children
god
is
dead
have
you
heard
do
you
know
god
is
dead
in
his
heaven
and
the
warlocks
are
loosed
on
the
land
and
on
the
last
day
of
the
moon
they
were
all
but
in
sight
of
the
desert
edge
though
they
did
know
and
the
goblins
and
the
warlocks
took
counsel
for
they
were
now
afraid
marco
and
his
few
people
would
escape
they
gathered
together
and
they
read
the
runes
of
the
flowing
sand
and
suddenly
the
camels
rushed
screaming
into
the
desert
with
sudden
panic
and
a
burning
wind
came
and
the
sands
rose
and
the
desert
heeled
like
a
ship
and
the
day
became
night
and
young
marco
polo
could
stand
no
more
that
was
the
end
the
end
of
him
the
end
of
the
world
the
end
of
everything
there
was
red
darkness
every
where
and
he
could
see
nobody
o
my
lord
jesus
he
cried
o
little
golden
bells
the
wind
boomed
like
an
organ
the
sand
screamed
o
my
lord
jesus
o
little
golden
bells
and
the
voices
of
his
father
and
uncle
were
like
the
tweeting
birds
the
lad
matthew
where
our
lad
mark
mark
where
have
you
got
to
lad
of
our
heart
where
are
you
but
they
could
find
each
other
the
sand
buffeted
them
like
shuttlecocks
boy
mark
the
sand
snarled
like
a
dog
the
wind
hammered
like
drums
oh
golden
bells
o
little
golden
bells
o
my
lord
jesus
must
it
end
here
and
the
fight
went
out
of
him
and
a
big
sob
broke
in
him
and
he
lay
down
to
die

in
the
garden
the
butterflies
the
red
and
black
and
golden
butterflies
flitted
from
blossom
to
blossom
and
the
bees
droned
and
on
the
banks
of
the
green
lake
the
kingfisher
tunneled
his
wee
house
and
the
wind
shook
the
blossoms
of
the

sat
on

was
very
uncomfortable
and
in

dark
bower
was

magician
brooding
like
an
owl
and
golden
bells
stood
before

it

and
the
king
of

did
to
it
what
is
always
done
to
the
learned
and
eloquent
he
took
a
cage
with
stout
bars
and
shut
up

and
was
that
the
cruel
thing
to
write
and
are
you
so
imprisoned

thinking
hard
of
you
i
thinking
hard
well
now
golden

to
tell
you
the
truth
there
was
no
excuse
for
it
but
often
times
i
do
be
feeling
sad
and
thinking
of
the
friends
of
my
youth
who
are
gone

who
might
have
been
a
better
poet
nor
me
if

and
li

ah
they
were
great
poets

they
never
sang
a
poor
song

that
they
might
wear
a
fine
coat
and
they
write
what
was
true
wee

all
the
world
to
turn
from

and
the

now
the
court

living
in
my
glory
and
dead
with
their
dreams
i
the
last
of
the
seven
minstrels
and
wee
golden
bells
i
do
be
thinking
long
and
sometimes
an
old
woman
in
the
street
or
a
man
with
gray
in
his
hair
will
lift
a
song
and
before
the
words
come
to
me
there
a
pain
in
my
heart
and
i
go
down
to
the
drinking
booths
and
the
passion
of
drinking
comes
on
me
a
fury
against
myself
and
a
fury
against
the
world
and
the
folk
do
be
following
me
to
see
will
i
let
drop
one
gem
of
verse
that
they
can
tell
their
grandchildren
they
heard
from
the
lips
of
li
po
and
when
my
heart
is
high
with
the
drinking
i
take
a
lute
from
a
traveling
poet
and
not
knowing
what
i
saying
i
compose
the
song
out
of
fallow
sorrow
bloom
the
little
songs
you
must
be
hard
on
an
old
man
wee
golden
bells
and
he
thinking
long
for
his
dead
friends
ah
poor
li
po
she

chapter
xiii
and
now
when
marco
polo
was
rested
and
had
recovered
they
brought
him
from
the
convent
of
the
red
monks
to
where
the
khan
was
in
the
city
of
chandu
now
there
were
two
palaces
in
chandu
there
was
the
winter
palace
which
was
of
marble
and
the
summer
palace
which
was
of
gilt
cane
around
these
palaces
there
was
built
a
wall
sixteen
miles
in
compass
and
inside
of
it
was
a
park
of
fountains
and
rivers
and
brooks
with
the
speckled
trout
in
them
and
meadows
with
the
lark
at
her
ease
in
the
grass
and
trees
of
all
varieties
where
the
little
birds
do
be
building
and
none
to
grudge
them
a
home
and
all
the
wild
animals
were
abundant
the
timid
hare
and
the
wild
deer
and
the
wee
croaking
frogs
colts
by
their
white
mothers
and
little
dogs
tumbling
over
themselves
with
the
sport
of
spring
brown
bees
among
the
clover
strawberries
in
profusion
trees
would
delight
your
eyes
and
brown
cows
and
black
cows
and
dappled
moilies
under
the
great
leaves
of
them
and
lambs
would
be
snowy
of
fleece
all
the
flowers
of
the
world
were
there
the
paradise
of
wild
things
it
was
the
park
of
kubla
khan
in
xanadu
did
kubla
khan
quoted
young
randall
a
stately
pleasure
dome
decree
where
alph
the
sacred
river
ran
through
caverns
measureless
to
man
down
to
a
sunless
sea
so
twice
five
miles
of
fertile
ground
with
walls
and
towers
were
girdled
round
and
there
were
gardens
bright
with
sinuous
rills
where
blossomed
many
an
tree
and
here
were
forests
ancient
as
the
hills
enfolding
sunny
spots
of
greenery
whose
poem
is
that
poem
brian
oge
it
is
a
poem
of
coleridge
malachi
i
though
it
was
maybe
a
poem
of
colquitto
dall
mccracken
of
skye
that
one
of
you
lads
had
put
english
on
it
is
a
poem
of
the
head
you
ken
and
colquitto
being
a
dark
man
could
only
see
with
the
eye
ghost
but
it
has
the
warmth
the
life
of
the
work
of
blind
colquitto
brian
oge
do
you
mind
the
poem
angus
more
campbell
of
rathlin
wrote
to
colquitto
dall
aoibhinn
duid
colquitto
dall
i
remembered
it
is
happy
for
thee
blind
colquitto
who
dost
not
see
much
of
women
if
thou
wert
to
see
what
we
see
thou
wouldst
be
tormented
even
as
i
am
my
sorrow
o
god
that
i
was
not
stricken
blind
before
i
saw
her
amber
twisted
hair
that
it
that
it
brian
oge
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
be
talking
of
poetry
there
is
no
poetry
in
this
story
i
will
now
tell
you
of
marco
polo
and
him
entering
the
presence
of
the
great
khan
chapter
xiv
and
marco
polo
was
brought
into
the
presence
and
among
all
assembled
there
you
could
hear
a
pin
drop
at
the
north
end
of
the
great
hall
sat
the
khan
himself
and
marco
polo
nearly
dropped
with
surprise
for
where
he
expected
a
great
magnificent
figure
of
a
man
with
majesty
shining
from
his
eyes
he
saw
only
a
pleasant
bearded
man
not
quarter
so
well
dressed
as
the
meanest
servant
on
the
room
and
a
fine
welcoming
smile
in
his
face
his
throne
was
elevated
so
that
his
feet
were
on
the
level
of
the
heads
of
the
kinsmen
of
the
blood
royal
beneath
him
and
they
in
silk
and
ermine
and
fine
brocades
and
jewels
and
beneath
these
were
the
barons
and
dukes
and
knights
and
beneath
these
were
the
captains
of
the
fighting
men
three
thousand
and
three
and
beneath
these
were
the
musicians
and
the
sorcerers
and
behind
kubla
khan
very
big
very
erect
stood
his
three
great
servants
the
keeper
of
the
hunting
leopards
the
keeper
of
the
speaking
drums
and
the
keeper
of
the
khan
swords
and
beside
kubla
khan
on
a
little
throne
sat
golden
bells
and
it
was
the
sight
of
her
more
than
the
sight
of
the
great
assembly
that
dumbed
the
words
in
his
mouth
and
kubla
was
smiling
at
him
and
she
was
smiling
too
and
kubla
saw
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
that
there
was
embarrassment
on
him
and
he
rose
from
his
throne
there
is
welcome
for
you
here
marco
polo
and
no
enmity
there
is
interest
in
and
eagerness
for
your
message
there
is
none
here
will
criticize
you
or
make
it
hard
for
you
let
there
be
no
shame
on
you
in
speaking
before
so
many
people
say
what
you
have
to
say
as
if
there
were
nobody
here
if
that
will
help
you
barring
myself
and
the
little
daughter
beside
me
o
emperor
the
words
came
back
to
marco
polo
and
ye
great
princes
dukes
and
marquises
counts
knights
and
burgesses
and
people
of
all
degrees
who
desire
the
light
of
the
world
grace
be
to
you
and
peace
from
god
our
father
and
from
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
message
i
have
to
give
you
i
shall
give
in
the
words
of
him
whose
perfect
message
it
is
pauperes
spiritu
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
ipsorum
est
regnum
caelorum
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mites
blessed
are
the
meek
and
marco
polo
went
on
and
quoted
for
them
the
words
that
were
spoken
on
the
mount
in
galilee
and
they
listened
to
him
with
great
civility
and
attention
and
little
golden
bells
leaned
forward
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
kubla
leaned
back
in
his
throne
with
his
eyes
half
closed
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whoever
shall
smite
thee
on
the
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
and
at
this
the
great
khan
looked
up
puzzled
and
a
movement
went
through
the
fighting
men
in
the
hall
but
wee
golden
bells
never
budged
a
minute
and
marco
polo
went
on
factum
est
cum
consummasset
jesus
verba
haec
and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
doctrine
i
shall
now
tell
you
of
the
life
and
death
of
the
lord
jesus
he
told
them
of
the
birth
in
bethlehem
and
of
the
teaching
on
the
hills
and
the
poets
nodded
their
heads
and
he
told
them
of
the
cleansing
of
the
lepers
and
of
the
casting
out
of
devils
and
the
raising
of
lazarus
from
the
dead
and
the
magicians
wondered
and
he
told
them
of
the
betrayal
by
judas
with
a
kiss
and
the
shuffled
in
their
seats
and
he
told
them
of
the
scourging
and
of
the
crowning
with
thorns
and
the
great
khan
snicked
his
dagger
in
and
out
of
the
sheath
and
a
mist
of
tears
came
into
the
eyes
of
golden
bells
and
he
told
them
of
the
crucifixion
between
two
thieves
and
a
great
oath
ripped
from
the
beard
of
kubla
khan
and
the
silver
tears
ran
from
the
eyes
of
golden
bells
on
the
third
day
he
arose
from
the
dead
and
a
great
shout
came
from
the
throat
of
kubla
khan
and
he
stood
up
he
arose
from
among
the
dead
men
i
warrant
he
showed
himself
to
the
roman
pilate
in
all
his
power
and
majesty
no
said
marco
palo
then
he
showed
himself
to
the
thousands
who
had
seen
him
die
upon
the
gallows
tree
no
said
marco
polo
who
saw
him
then
his
twelve
apostles
and
they
in
a
little
room
and
kubla
khan
sat
down
suddenly
and
said
no
more
there
was
a
moment
murmur
of
wonder
among
the
assembly
and
then
silence
and
marco
heart
fell
and
he
was
aware
of
two
things
of
the
great
politeness
of
the
chinese
people
and
of
golden
bell
pitying
eyes
chapter
xv
when
kubla
khan
dismissed
the
assembly
and
he
took
marco
polo
into
a
and
golden
bells
came
with
them
and
what
did
you
think
sir
of
what
i
said
and
can
you
not
see
sir
the
truth
that
in
me
well
now
laddie
said
the
great
khan
when
we
come
to
examine
this
sermon
you
quoted
to
us
what
is
there
in
it
but
the
rule
of
the
righteous
man
we
had
a
great
thinker
and
pious
man
of
our
own
confucius
i
not
a
reading
man
says
he
but
i
got
an
idea
says
he
that
there
is
a
thing
you
said
but
is
embraced
in
the
analects
and
if
it
is
it
be
in
the
teachings
of
the
lord
buddha
ah
but
sir
marco
polo
said
you
have
to
admit
that
he
of
whom
i
speak
was
the
true
god
made
man
now
laddie
remember
i
an
old
man
set
in
my
head
and
my
ways
and
i
been
used
to
one
belief
so
long
it
would
be
hard
changing
so
do
press
me
now
do
press
me
i
ask
you
ah
sir
pleaded
marco
polo
it
terrible
to
think
of
as
great
a
prince
as
you
to
be
in
the
black
spaces
outside
of
heaven
because
you
would
accept
the
truth
well
maybe
they
wo
be
so
hard
on
one
my
dear
lad
when
my
time
comes
and
i
rap
on
the
gate
of
your
heaven
maybe
they
say
only
old
kubla
the
soldier
is
in
it
he
knows
devil
and
all
about
religion
but
his
fights
were
fair
fights
and
he
never
hit
a
man
when
he
was
down
he
had
a
soft
heart
for
wee
children
and
he
was
easy
on
horses
sure
what
the
difference
let
him
in
and
if
they
say
no
i
tuck
the
old
nicked
claymore
under
my
arm
and
be
off
to
where
the
other
old
fighters
are
i
see
sir
that
there
was
little
success
to
my
message
i
would
say
that
said
kubla
khan
wait
a
little
until
you
perform
miracles
before
the
people
to
prove
your
truth
you
know
better
then
ah
sir
said
marco
polo
i
can
perform
no
miracles
is
only
a
saint
can
perform
miracles
and
i
could
lace
a
saint
shoes
i
have
no
miracles
oh
well
now
my
dear
boy
said
kubla
khan
i
hate
to
tell
you
but
there
no
use
going
further
sure
you
be
up
against
the
sorcerers
of
the
world
they
ask
you
for
a
sign
and
you
have
no
sign
and
they
have
signs
in
abundance
i
would
think
of
letting
you
go
against
them
fair
play
a
jewel
and
you
would
have
a
chance
there
the
red
pope
from
tibet
and
there
the
black
magician
from
korea
and
a
hundred
minor
ones
and
the
warlock
of
the
north
from
the
islands
of
ice
who
governs
the
hail
and
the
snow
child
i
let
you
get
into
the
same
ring
with
them
they
ruin
you
but
sir
was
it
a
great
miracle
of
the
lord
my
rescue
in
the
gobi
desert
a
miracle
of
the
lord
a
miracle
of
golden
bells
here
it
was
her
magician
saw
you
and
she
had
the
message
put
on
the
drums
and
the
desert
patrols
went
to
seek
you
it
was
herself
here
wee
golden
bells
and
golden
bells
mouth
gave
a
smile
of
shame
that
his
thought

and
he
told
of
the
flight
into
egypt
when
savage
herod
reigned
and
of
the
jewish
maid
and
her
child
sleeping
beneath
the
shadow
of

shades

old

looked

reverence

the
io

osiris

the
painted

in

out

sluggish
nile
came
the
strange
aquatic
population
the
torpid
crocodiles

monstrous
water
lizards

the
great
hippopotami
lumbered
to
bow
before
the
little
lord

all
things
and
he
told
her
how
satan
had
tempted
him
on
the
lonely

the
poem

is
best
known

every

eagerly
as
i
am
listening
to
your

but
you
are
not
taking
it
in

is
very
hard
to
take
in
marco

it
happened
so
long
ago
it
is
hard
to
think
of
a
tragedy
in
a
strange
country
and
we
in
this
garden
on
the
second
moon
of
spring
and
it
was
so
very
long
ago
do
you
hear
the
bees

the
bees
among

and
see
the
blue
heron
by
the
lotus
flowers
and
do
you
see
the
little
tortoise
marco

and
he
sunning
himself
on
a
leaf
if
i
throw
a
pebble

he
will
dive
and
he
is
such
a
clumsy

anything

be
coming
all
the

over

to
be
telling

a
lie

once
i
was
unhappy
marco

i
used
sit
here
and
on
my
lute
i
used
play
the
of
the
willow
branches
which
is
the
saddest
song
in
the
world
under
the
moon
i
used
be
lonely
and
the
droning
of
the
bees
meant
nothing
to
me
and
now
it
is
a
sweet
brave
song
i
can
not
play

any
more
so
alien
is
sadness
to
me
and
the
moon
smiles
i
am
very
happy

true

chapter
xviii
and
he
told
her
of
paul
who
had
seen
a
vision
and
gone
preaching
through
the
world
who
was
persecuted
who
was
shipwrecked
who
was
bitten
by
a
viper
and
who
survived
everything
that
he
might
preach
the
lord
jesus
he
was
a
fierce
ragged
man
with
burning
eyes
and
he
told
her
of
paul
instructions
to
women
you
do
not
look
at
me
when
you
speak
marco
polo
only
your
voice
comes
to
me
not
your
eyes
is
it
because
of
paul
and
marco
polo
felt
great
trouble
on
him
because
he
could
not
explain
but
golden
bells
went
on
there
is
little
in
your
faith
about
women
marco
polo
is
it
a
faith
only
for
men
then
is
it
against
women
must
the
young
men
not
look
at
the
young
women
no
golden
bells
the
young
men
must
not
look
too
much
on
the
young
women
but
that
is
very
foolish
marco
polo
is
it
wrong
to
see
the
beauty
of
the
almond
blossoms
wrong
to
taste
the
scented
wind
is
it
wrong
to
watch
the
kingfisher
seeking
his
nest
is
it
wrong
to
watch
the
moon
the
stars
all
these
are
very
beautiful
marco

so
beautiful
as
to
make

is

it

the
glory

in

beauty

li

old

wise

a
great
poet

li
po
says
there
is
beauty
in

running
horse
and
beauty
in
a
running
stream
but
there
is
no
beauty
like
the
beauty
of

she
letting
down
her

god
made
the
beauty
of

too
marco

as
well
as

beauty
of

wo
you
please
explain
to
me
marco

why
should
li

say
one
thing
and
saint
paul
another
but
golden
bells
saint
paul
is
inspired
of
god
but
li
po
is
inspired
of
god
too
marco
polo
you
must
be
thinking
little
of
li
po
he
is
fat
and
old
and
drunken
but
when
he
sings
marco

it
is
the
song
of
the
wandering
stars

why
must
not
the
young
men
look
at
the
young

why
must
they
not
look
with

it

look
at

now
marco

lift
up
your
eyes

into
my

there
evil
in

avoid

maybe

chapter

thus
far
said
malachi
of
the
long
glen
the
story
of
marco
polo
that
is
a
warm
story
malachi
of
the
glen
a
warm
and
colored
story
and
great
life
to
it
and
golden
bells
is
as
alive
to
me
as
herself
there
by
the
fire
and
i
can
see
marco
polo
as
plain
as
i
can
see
my
cousin
randall
and
he
playing
with
dogs
if
they
were
real
and
live
and
warm
what
would
a
story
be
brian
oge
but
a
jumble
of
dead
words
a
house
with
nobody
in
it
the
poorest
thing
in
the
world
but
marco
polo
came
back
to
venice
malachi
and
fought
in
the
there
more
to
tell
brian
oge
but
sometimes
i
wonder
should
the
best
part
of
the
story
be
kept
to
yourself
the
people
are
as
wise
as
they
used
to
be
brown
lad
the
end
of
a
story
now
is
a
bit
of
kissing
and
courting
and
the
kettle
boiling
to
be
making
tea
but
the
older
ones
were
wiser
brian
donn
they
knew
that
the
rhythm
of
life
is
long
and
swinging
and
that
time
does
stop
short
as
a
clock
sure
what
is
a
kiss
from
the
finest
of
women
but
a
pleasant
thing
like
a
long
putt
sunk
or
the
first
salmon
of
the
year
caught
like
a
trout
or
the
ball
through
the
goal
before
the
whistle
blows
and
there
many
a
belly
over
a
hungry
soul
but
a
story
is
how
destiny
is
interwoven
the
fine
and
gallant
and
the
tragic
points
of
life
and
you
must
look
at
them
with
the
eyes
of
the
body
but
you
must
feel
with
the
antennae
of
your
being
now
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
lord
jesus
with
physical
eyes
what
would
it
be
but
a
kindly
crazy
man
and
he
coming
to
a
hard
and
bitter
end
look
at
it
simply
and
what
was
the
story
of
troy
but
a
dirty
row
over
a
woman
but
often
times
the
stories
with
endings
that
grocer
daughters
do
not
be
liking
are
the
stories
that
are
worth
while
and
the
worth
while
stories
do
be
lasting
never
clip
a
story
because
widow
robinson
does
like
to
have
her
mind
disturbed
and
she
warming
her
breadth
at
the
fire
the
widow
robinson
may
have
a
white
coin
to
buy
a
book
with
and
think
you
the
grand
author
entirely
and
you
pleasing
her
but
lord
god
who
gave
you
the
stories
know
you
for
a
louse
i
call
to
your
mind
the
stories
of
great
english
writer
the
plays
of
the
prince
of
denmark
and
the
poor
blind
king
on
the
cliff
and
the
scottish
chieftain
and
his
terrible
wife
the
widow
robinson
will
not
like
those
stories
and
she
will
be
keeping
her
white
coin
but
those
stories
will
endure
forever
i
will
now
tell
you
of
marco
polo
and
him
leaving
china
chapter
xxi
you
must
see
him
now
as
he
was
seventeen
years
after
he
had
come
to
china
and
fourteen
years
after
his
wife
little
golden
bells
had
died
a
lean
figure
of
a
man
with
his
hair
streaked
with
gray
a
lean
hard
face
on
him
and
savage
eyes
and
all
the
body
of
him
steel
and
from
riding
on
the
great
khan
business
and
riding
fast
and
furious
so
that
he
might
sleep
and
forget
but
forgetting
never
came
to
him
you
might
think
he
was
a
harsh
man
from
his
face
and
eyes
but
he
was
the
straight
man
in
administering
justice
and
he
had
the
soft
heart
for
the
poor
the
heart
of
golden
bells
he
was
easily
moved
to
anger
but
the
fine
chinese
people
never
minded
him
knowing
he
was
a
suffering
man
though
never
a
word
of
golden
bells
came
from
his
mouth
barring
maybe
that
line
of
dante
the
saddest
line
in
the
world
and
that
he
used
to
repeat
to
himself
and
no
one
there
bella
persona
che
mi
fu
tolta
che
mi
fu
tolta
who
was
taken
from
me
taken
taken
from
me
and
oftentimes
a
look
would
come
over
his
face
as
if
he
were
listening
for
a
voice
to
speak
listening
listening
and
then
a
wee
harsh
laugh
would
come
from
him
very
heartbreaking
to
hear
and
whatever
was
in
his
hand
papers
or
a
he
would
pitch
down
and
walk
away
he
had
just
come
in
from
the
borders
of
the
arctic
lands
from
giving
the
khan
orders
to
the
squat
hairy
tribes
who
live
by
the
icy
shores
and
had
come
to
the
garden
by
the
lake
of
cranes
the
garden
where
the
golden
bells
of
singing
and
laughter
were
dumb
this
armful
of
years
and
he
was
alone
and
the
listening
look
was
on
his
face
when
there
came
kubla
and
li
po
and
the
old
magician
now
kubla
was
very
old
so
old
he
could
hardly
walk
and
very
frail
and
li
po
was
very
old
too
and
gray
in
the
face
and
sadder
in
the
eyes
than
ever
and
the
magician
white
beard
had
grown
to
his
knees
but
there
was
no
more
humor
in
his
eyes
and
marco
polo
helped
the
old
khan
to
sit
down
oh
sir
why
did
you
come
to
me
sure
i
was
going
to
you
the
moment
i
had
changed
my
sir
you
should
have
stayed
in
your
bed
there
was
something
on
my
mind
marco
and
the
old
do
be
thinking
long
to
get
things
off
their
mind
what
can
i
do
sir
marco
my
child

must
take
what
i
say
amiss
but
i
want
you
to
be
going
back

be
going
back
to
venice
sir
what
have
i
done
to
dissatisfy
you
in
all
my
embassies
have
i
been
weak
to
the
strong
or
bullying
toward
the
weak
does
an
oppressed
man
complain
of
injustice
does
a
merchant
complain
of
being
cheated
or
a
woman
say
she
was
wronged
now
marco
of
my
heart
did
i
say
not
to
be
taking
it
amiss
is
there
any
one
closer
to
me
nor
you
or
is
it
likely
i
be
listening
to
stories
brought
against
you
it
just
this
i
an
old
and
tired
man
marco
beag
and
in
a
week
or
a
moon
at
most

the
sanang
tells
me

the
dear
lad

there
not
one
man
in
all
china

a
harsh
or
an
unjust
thing
but
my
dear
son
just
the
way
of
people
there
a
power
of
hard
feeling
against
you
in
this
land
you
being
a
stranger
and
having
stood
so
high
so
when
i
dead
dear
son
there
many
would
do
you
an
injury
and
treat
you
badly
aye
in
our
family
itself
though
they
smile
on
you
now
let
you
be
going
now
marco
i
miss
you
to
close
my
eyes
for
me
but
my
heart
will
be
lighter

will
so
i
could
sleep
easy
and
you
ill
treated
in
this
land
of
mine
you
ask
him
too
li
po

marco
laughed
and
li
po
what
is

treatment
to
me
sorrow
my
blood
brother
what
i
suffered
do
you
think
i
could
suffer
more
i
know
marco
i
know
do
you
think
i
suffer
now
sir
fourteen
years
she
dead
now
the
wee
one
who
lay
by
my
side
in
sleep
and
never
a
word
and
never
a
sign
in
the
house
where
we
were
married
i
can
see
the
pool
and
the
willows
and
the
hibiscus
but
there
is
never
a
token
of
her
he
broke
out
the
leaves
of
trees
cover
the
pavilion
the
hair
of
the
musicians
is
silver
and
dust
is
on
the
blue
and
white
tiles
and
she
never
comes
to
comfort
pie
i
ca
sleep
with
waiting
the
stars
never
seem
to
wane
and
the
hoar
frost
comes
on
the
grass
and
always
waiting
christ
why
should
i
go
back
i
forgotten
venice
i
even
forgotten
my
god
for
her
sanang
says
kubla
khan
to
the
magician
could
you
do
something
for
this
poor
lad
it
was
now
dusk
in
the
garden
by
the
lake
of
cranes
i
do
need
any
damned
wizard
to
bring
my
wife
to
me
raged
marco
polo
if
she
were
to
come
she
would
come
and
i
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
the
moorfowl
calling
she
would
have
come
because
my
heart
needed
her
and
he
raged
through
the
dusk
by
the
lake
of
cranes
now
marco
dear
lad
do
be
flying
off
again
but
remember
that
there
is
science
needed
to
all
things
and
think
too
that
maybe
she
was
not
permitted
the
older
we
get
the
more
we
understand
the
destiny
that
rules
all
things
with
now
a
nudge
with
now
a
leading
finger
with
now
a
terrible
blow
over
the
heart
and
what
we
think
at
was
a
trifling
accident
at
we
know
to
have
been
the
enormous
gesture
of
god
we
are
not
asked
when
we
like
to
be
born
marco
nor
is
it
up
to
us
when
to
die
and
again
marco
consider
if
she
were
to
have
come
to
you
in
the
dark
of
the
in
the
strange
mystic
hours
when
you
can
hear
eternity
tick
like
a
clock
your
eyes
would
have
been
not
on
this
world
but
the
next
your
look
would
have
been
vacant
that
now
keen
to
discover
injustice
your
body
would
have
been
flabby
that
now
whalebone
and
steel
and
there
would
have
been
no
memory
of
you
in
china
that
now
like
sweet
honey
in
the
mouth
would
a
wee
dead
spirit
be
proud
of
a
man
marco
and
he
just
crying
crying
crying
and
letting
the
days
go
by
while
even
the
brown
bee
works
and
even
the
grass
grows
that
cattle
may
fatten
and
men
eat
she
might
be
sorry
but
would
there
be
pride
on
her
even
a
dead
woman
wants
a
strong
man
now
i
not
saying
that
the
silent
dead
should
not
have
a
voice
in
our
affairs
when
we
need
them
but
they
have
wisdom
else
what
is
the
use
of
having
died
and
if
the
sanang
can
bring
her
she
come
now
and
join
with
us
in
asking
you
now
being
the
time
she
needed
child
be
guided
by
us
three
ancient
men
i
have
lived
long
and
have
knowledge
of
the
world
li
po
has
lived
long
and
has
knowledge
of
the
heart
the
sanang
has
lived
long
and
knows
the
secrets
of
the
dead
if
to
our
three
voices
who
love
you
there
is
added
a
sign
from
golden
bells
will
you
leave
china
if
there
is
a
sign
from
her
i
leave
china
said
marco
polo
and
it
was
dusk
in
the
garden
by
the
lake
of
cranes
chapter
xxii
the
sanang
came
over
to
marco
polo
give
me
the
black
tress
that
over
your
heart
and
marco
polo
undid
his
coat
and
his
undercoat
and
his
fine
sark
and
took
out
the
perfumed
hair
and
gave
it
to
the
sanang
let
you
sing
a
little
song
li
po
the
magician
said
the
way
be
hearing
and
come
i
have
part
of
her
here
and
let
you
put
in
the
garden
the
atmosphere
she
loved
and
li
po
took
his
lute
and
plucked
gently
at
the
strings
the
swish
of
your
silken
skirt
is
discontinued
he
sang
and
the
grass
grows
through
the
broken
hearth
stone
and
your
room
that
was
so
warm
and
swept
is
cold
and
mouldy
but
he
the
beloved
of
your
heart
clings
on
a
fallen
leaf
in
the
chink
of
a
door
in
the
chink
of
a
closed
door
and
it
was
dusk
in
the
garden
and
the
voice
of
li
po
broke
and
his
lute
stilled
and
the
old
emperor
breathed
his
aged
gentle
breathing
and
the
sanang
said
his
secret
terrible
formulae
and
marco
polo
was
tense
as
a
hunting
dog
and
suddenly
at
the
end
of
the
garden
in
the
perfumed
asian
dusk
there
was
a
beam
like
moonlight
and
into
the
soft
ray
of
it
trod
little
golden
bells
with
her
wee
warm
face
and
her
wee
warm
hands
and
her
hair
dark
as
a
cloud
and
her
eyes
pleading
pleading
go
now
marco
polo
please
go
her
lips
made
the
words
but
no
sound
came
to
him
oh
golden
bells
golden
bells
he
rushed
forward
but
the
moonlight
of
no
moon
faded
and
there
was
nothing
and
he
dropped
on
his
knees
sobbing
in
the
dusk
by
the
lake
of
cranes
chapter
xxiii
and
after
a
while
he
got
up
from
his
knees
and
set
his
teeth
on
his
sobbing
and
threw
his
head
back
and
squared
his
shoulders
and
notched
his
belt
and
faced
the
three
ancient
men
well
he
said
that
that
he
went
over
and
knelt
and
kissed
the
khan
hand
you
be
seeing
her
soon
sir
you
be
telling
her
everything
yes
son
i
tell
her
then
he
patted
the
sanang
on
the
shoulder
and
thanks
said
he
simply
and
he
took
li
po
hand
in
both
his
and
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
no
words
came
to
either
well
he
says
at
length
i
be
hitting
the
road
then
i
not
say
to
any
of
you
i
be
seeing
you
all
pretty
soon
again
there
a
war
on
between
venice
and
the
genoese
and
where
hottest
you
find
me
and
the
quicker
my
end
the
better
i
be
pleased
but
it
would
be
like
my
luck
he
said
bitterly
not
to
be
killed
but
to
be
taken
prisoner
and
to
end
my
life
in
some
lousy
jail
oh
well
we
hope
for
the
best
he
laughed
so
so
long
and
the
four
of
them
looked
at
one
another
trying
to
smile
and
great
grief
on
them
china
will
miss
you
my
son
said
old
kubla
it
nothing
to
how
i
be
missing
china
said
marco
polo
venice
it
only
a
sound
to
me
i
be
an
exile
in
the
city
of
my
birth
but
what
the
use
of
complaining
if
it
go
it
go
but
it
be
funny
said
he
my
body
will
be
there
but
my
heart
and
mind
will
be
in
china
there
be
a
gray
eye
always
turning
to
china
and
it
will
never
see
china
queer
all
the
voices
and
all
the
instruments
in
saint
mark
and
in
my
ears
the
little
drums
of
china
all
the
sunlight
will
be
glinting
on
the
grand
canal
but
the
little
rain
of
china
the
little
rain
of
china
will
be
falling
in
my
heart
ah
well
if
it
go
it
go
i
better
be
hitting
the
road
so
i
say
for
the
present
and
oh
my
god
almighty
