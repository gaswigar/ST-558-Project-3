the
scottish
chiefs
by

chapter
scotland
bright
was
the
summer
of
the
war
which
had
desolated
scotland
was
then
at
an
end
ambition
seemed
satiated
and
the
vanquished
after
having
passed
under
the
yoke
of
their
enemy
concluded
they
might
wear
their
chains
in
peace
such
were
the
hopes
of
those
scottish
noblemen
who
early
in
the
preceding
spring
had
signed
the
bond
of
submission
to
a
ruthless
conqueror
purchasing
life
at
the
price
of
all
that
makes
life
and
honor
prior
to
this
act
of
vassalage
edward
king
of
england
had
entered
scotland
at
the
head
of
an
immense
army
he
seized
berwick
by
stratagem
laid
the
country
in
ashes
and
on
the
field
of
dunbar
forced
the
scottish
king
and
his
nobles
to
acknowledge
him
their
liege
lord
but
while
the
courts
of
edward
or
of
his
representatives
were
crowded
by
the
humbled
scots
the
spirit
of
one
brave
man
remained
unsubdued
disgusted
alike
at
the
facility
with
which
the
sovereign
of
a
warlike
nation
could
resign
his
people
and
his
crown
into
the
hands
of
a
treacherous
invader
and
at
the
pusillanimity
of
the
nobles
who
had
ratified
the
sacrifice
william
wallace
retired
to
the
glen
of
ellerslie
withdrawn
from
the
world
he
hoped
to
avoid
the
sight
of
oppressions
he
could
not
redress
and
the
endurance
of
injuries
beyond
his
power
to
avenge
thus
checked
at
the
opening
of
life
in
the
career
of
glory
that
was
his
in
the
bloom
of
manhood
from
the
social
haunts
of
men
he
repressed
the
eager
aspirations
of
his
mind
and
strove
to
acquire
that
resignation
to
inevitable
evils
which
alone
could
reconcile
him
to
forego
the
promises
of
his
youth
and
enable
him
to
view
with
patience
a
humiliation
of
scotland
which
blighted
her
honor
menaced
her
existence
and
consigned
her
sons
to
degradation
or
obscurity
the
latter
was
the
choice
of
wallace
too
noble
to
bend
his
spirit
to
the
usurper
too
honest
to
affect
submission
he
resigned
himself
to
the
only
way
left
of
maintaining
the
independence
of
a
true
scot
and
giving
up
the
world
at
once
all
the
ambitions
of
youth
became
extinguished
in
his
breast
since
nothing
was
preserved
in
his
country
to
sanctify
their
fires
scotland
seemed
proud
of
her
chains
not
to
share
in
such
debasement
appeared
all
that
was
now
in
his
power
and
within
the
shades
of
ellerslie
he
found
a
retreat
and
a
home
whose
sweets
beguiling
him
of
every
care
made
him
sometimes
forget
the
wrongs
of
his
country
in
the
tranquil
enjoyments
of
wedded
love
during
the
happy
mouths
of
the
preceding
autumn
while
scotland
was
yet
free
and
the
path
of
honorable
distinction
still
open
before
her
young
nobility
wallace
married
marion
braidfoot
the
beautiful
heiress
of
lammington
nearly
of
the
same
age
and
brought
up
from
childhood
together
reciprocal
affection
had
grown
with
their
growth
and
sympathy
of
tastes
and
virtues
and
mutual
tenderness
made
them
so
entirely
one
that
when
at
the
age
of
the
enraptured
lover
was
allowed
to
pledge
that
faith
publicly
at
the
altar
which
he
had
so
often
vowed
in
secret
to
his
marion
he
clasped
her
to
his
heart
and
softly
whispered
dearer
than
life
part
of
my
being
blessed
is
this
union
that
mingles
thy
soul
with
mine
now
and
forever
edward
invasion
of
scotland
broke
in
upon
their
innocent
joys
wallace
threw
aside
the
wedding
garment
for
the
cuirass
and
the
sword
but
he
was
not
permitted
long
to
use
either
scotland
submitted
to
her
enemies
and
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
bow
to
her
oppressors
or
to
become
an
exile
from
man
amid
the
deep
glens
of
his
country
the
tower
of
ellerslie
was
henceforth
the
lonely
abode
of
himself
and
his
bride
the
neighboring
nobles
avoided
him
because
the
principles
he
declared
were
a
tacit
reproach
on
their
proceedings
and
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
as
he
forbore
to
seek
them
they
even
forgot
that
he
was
in
existence
indeed
all
occasions
of
mixing
with
society
he
now
rejected
the
with
which
he
had
delighted
to
follow
the
flying
roebuck
from
glade
to
glade
the
arrows
with
which
he
used
to
bring
down
the
heavy
ptarmigan
or
the
towering
eagle
all
were
laid
aside
scottish
liberty
was
no
more
and
wallace
would
have
blushed
to
have
shown
himself
to
the
deer
of
his
native
hills
in
communion
of
sports
with
the
spoilers
of
his
country
had
he
pursued
his
once
favorite
exercises
he
must
have
mingled
with
the
english
now
garrisoned
in
every
town
and
who
passed
their
hours
of
leisure
in
the
chase
being
resigned
to
bury
his
youth
since
its
strength
could
no
longer
be
serviceable
to
his
his
harp
and
the
sweet
converse
of
his
tender
marion
became
the
occupations
of
his
days
ellerslie
was
his
hermitage
and
there
closed
from
the
world
with
an
angel
his
companion
he
might
have
forgotten
edward
was
lord
in
scotland
had
not
that
which
was
without
his
little
paradise
made
a
way
to
its
gates
and
showed
him
the
slavery
of
the
nobles
and
the
wretchedness
of
the
people
in
these
cases
his
generous
hand
gave
succor
where
it
could
not
bring
redress
those
whom
the
lawless
plunderer
had
driven
from
their
houses
or
stripped
of
their
covering
found
shelter
clothing
and
food
at
the
house
of
sir
william
wallace
ellerslie
was
the
refuge
of
the
friendless
and
the
comfort
of
the
unhappy
wherever
lady
wallace
moved
whether
looking
out
from
her
window
on
the
accidental
passenger
or
taking
her
morning
or
moonlight
walks
through
the
glen
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
husband
she
had
the
rapture
of
hearing
his
steps
greeted
and
followed
by
the
blessings
of
the
poor
destitute
and
the
prayers
of
them
who
were
ready
to
perish
it
was
then
that
this
happy
woman
would
raise
her
husband
hands
to
her
lips
and
in
silent
adoration
thank
god
for
blessing
her
with
a
being
made
so
truly
in
his
own
image
several
months
of
this
blissful
and
uninterrupted
solitude
had
elapsed
when
lady
wallace
saw
a
chieftain
at
her
gate
he
inquired
for
its
master
requested
a
private
conference
and
retired
with
him
into
a
remote
room
they
remained
together
for
an
hour
wallace
then
came
forth
and
ordering
his
horse
with
four
followers
to
be
in
readiness
said
he
meant
to
accompany
his
guest
to
douglas
castle
when
he
embraced
his
wife
at
parting
he
told
her
that
as
douglas
was
only
a
few
miles
distant
he
should
be
at
home
again
before
the
moon
rose
she
passed
the
tedious
hours
of
his
absence
with
tranquillity
till
the
appointed
signal
of
his
return
appeared
from
behind
the
summits
of
the
opposite
mountains
so
bright
were
its
beams
that
marion
did
not
need
any
other
light
to
show
her
the
stealing
sands
of
her
as
they
numbered
the
prolonged
hours
of
her
husband
stay
she
dismissed
her
servants
to
their
rest
all
excepting
halbert
the
harper
of
wallace
and
he
like
herself
was
too
unaccustomed
to
the
absence
of
his
master
to
find
sleep
visit
his
eyes
while
ellerslie
was
bereft
of
its
joy
and
its
guard
as
the
night
advanced
lady
wallace
sat
in
the
window
of
her
which
looked
toward
the
west
she
watched
the
winding
pathway
that
led
from
lanark
down
the
opposite
heights
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
waving
plumes
of
her
husband
when
he
should
emerge
from
behind
the
hill
and
pass
under
the
thicket
which
overhung
the
road
how
often
as
a
cloud
obscured
for
an
instant
the
moon
light
and
threw
a
transitory
shade
across
the
path
did
her
heart
bound
with
the
thought
that
her
watching
was
at
an
end
it
was
he
whom
she
had
seen
start
from
the
abrupt
rock
they
were
the
folds
of
his
tartan
that
darkened
the
white
cliff
but
the
moon
again
rolled
through
her
train
of
clouds
and
threw
her
light
around
where
then
was
her
wallace
alas
it
was
only
a
shadow
she
had
seen
the
hill
was
still
lonely
and
he
whom
she
sought
was
yet
far
away
overcome
with
watching
expectation
and
disappointment
unable
to
say
whence
arose
her
fears
she
sat
down
again
to
look
but
her
eyes
were
blinded
with
tears
and
in
a
voice
interrupted
by
sighs
she
exclaimed
not
yet
not
yet
ah
my
wallace
what
evil
hath
betided
thee
trembling
with
a
nameless
terror
she
knew
not
what
to
dread
she
believed
that
all
hostile
recounters
had
ceased
when
scotland
no
longer
contended
with
edward
the
nobles
without
remonstrance
had
surrendered
their
castles
into
the
hands
of
the
usurper
and
the
peasantry
following
the
example
of
their
lords
had
allowed
their
homes
to
be
ravaged
without
lifting
an
arm
in
their
defense
opposition
being
over
nothing
could
then
threaten
her
husband
from
the
enemy
and
was
not
the
person
who
had
taken
him
from
ellerslie
a
friend
before
wallace
departure
he
had
spoken
to
marion
alone
he
told
her
that
the
stranger
was
sir
john
monteith
the
youngest
son
of
the
brave
walter
lord
monteith
who
had
been
treacherously
put
to
death
by
the
english
in
the
early
part
of
the
foregoing
year
this
young
man
was
bequeathed
by
his
dying
father
to
the
particular
charge
of
his
friend
william
lord
douglas
at
that
time
governor
of
berwick
after
the
fall
of
that
place
and
the
captivity
of
its
defender
sir
jon
monteith
had
retired
to
douglas
castle
in
the
vicinity
of
lanark
and
was
now
the
sole
master
of
that
princely
residence
james
douglas
the
only
son
of
its
veteran
lord
being
still
at
paris
whither
he
had
been
dispatched
before
the
defeat
at
dunbar
to
negotiate
a
league
between
the
french
monarch
and
the
then
king
of
scots
stewart
the
father
of
sir
john
monteith
assumed
the
name
and
earldom
of
monteith
in
right
of
his
wife
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
the
preceding
earl
when
his
wife
died
he
married
an
englishwoman
of
rank
who
finding
him
ardently
attached
to
the
liberties
of
his
country
cut
him
off
by
poison
and
was
rewarded
by
the
enemies
of
scotland
for
this
murder
with
the
hand
of
a
british
informed
of
the
privacy
in
which
wallace
wished
to
live
monteith
had
never
ventured
to
disturb
it
until
this
day
but
knowing
the
steady
honor
of
his
old
he
came
to
entreat
him
by
the
respect
he
entertained
for
the
brave
douglas
and
by
his
love
for
his
country
that
he
would
not
refuse
to
accompany
him
to
the
brave
castle
i
have
a
secret
to
disclose
to
you
said
he
which
can
not
be
divulged
on
any
other
spot
unwilling
to
deny
so
small
a
favor
wallace
as
has
been
said
before
consented
and
accordingly
was
conducted
by
monteith
toward
douglas
while
descending
the
heights
which
led
to
the
castle
monteith
kept
a
profound
silence
and
when
crossing
the
drawbridge
toward
it
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
to
the
servants
for
equal
caution
this
was
explained
as
they
entered
the
gate
and
looked
around
it
was
guarded
by
english
soldiers
wallace
would
have
drawn
back
but
monteith
laid
his
hand
on
his
arm
and
whispered
for
your
country
at
these
words
a
spell
to
the
ear
of
wallace
he
proceeded
and
his
attendants
followed
into
the
courtyard
the
sun
was
just
setting
as
monteith
led
his
friend
into
the
absent
earl
room
its
glowing
reflection
on
the
distant
hills
reminded
wallace
of
the
stretch
he
had
to
retread
to
reach
his
home
before
midnight
and
thinking
of
his
anxious
marion
he
awaited
with
impatience
the
development
of
the
object
of
his
journey
monteith
closed
the
door
looked
fearfully
around
for
some
time
then
trembling
at
every
step
approached
wallace
when
drawn
quite
near
in
a
low
voice
he
said
you
must
swear
upon
the
cross
that
you
will
keep
inviolate
the
secret
i
am
going
to
reveal
wallace
put
aside
the
hilt
of
the
sword
which
monteith
presented
to
receive
his
oath
no
said
he
with
a
smile
in
these
times
i
will
not
bind
my
conscience
on
subjects
i
do
not
know
if
you
dare
trust
the
word
of
a
scotsman
and
a
friend
speak
out
and
if
the
matter
be
honest
my
honor
is
your
pledge
you
will
not
swear
no
then
i
must
not
trust
you
then
our
business
is
at
an
end
returned
wallace
rising
and
i
may
return
home
stop
cried
monteith
forgive
me
my
old
companion
that
i
have
dared
to
hesitate
these
are
indeed
times
of
such
treason
to
honor
that
i
do
not
wonder
you
should
be
careful
how
you
swear
but
the
nature
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
me
will
i
hope
convince
you
that
i
ought
not
to
share
it
rashly
of
any
one
but
you
whose
truth
stands
unsullied
amidst
the
faithlessness
of
the
best
i
would
exact
oaths
on
oaths
but
your
words
is
given
and
on
that
i
rely
await
me
here
monteith
unlocked
a
door
which
had
been
concealed
by
the
tapestry
and
after
a
short
absence
with
a
small
iron
box
he
set
it
on
the
table
near
his
friend
then
went
to
the
great
door
which
he
had
before
so
carefully
closed
tried
that
the
bolts
were
secure
and
returned
with
a
still
more
pallid
countenance
toward
the
table
wallace
surprised
at
so
much
actions
awaited
with
wonder
the
promised
explanation
monteith
sat
down
with
his
hand
on
the
box
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
it
began
i
am
going
to
mention
a
name
which
you
may
hear
with
patience
since
its
power
is
no
more
the
successful
rival
of
bruce
and
the
enemy
of
your
family
is
now
a
prisoner
in
the
tower
of
london
baliol
yes
answered
monteith
and
his
present
sufferings
will
perhaps
avenge
to
you
his
vindictive
resentment
of
the
injury
he
received
from
sir
ronald
crawford
my
grandfather
never
injured
him
nor
any
man
interrupted
wallace
sir
ronald
crawford
was
as
incapable
of
injustice
as
of
flattering
the
minions
of
his
country
enemy
but
baliol
is
fallen
and
i
forgive
him
did
you
witness
his
degradation
returned
monteith
you
would
even
pity
him
i
always
pity
the
wicked
continued
wallace
and
as
you
seem
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
enmity
against
sir
ronald
and
myself
in
justice
to
the
character
of
that
most
venerable
of
men
i
will
explain
it
i
first
saw
baliol
four
years
ago
when
i
accompanied
my
grandfather
to
witness
the
arbitration
of
the
king
of
scotland
between
the
two
contending
claimants
for
the
scottish
crown
sir
ronald
came
on
the
part
of
bruce
i
was
deemed
too
young
to
have
a
voice
in
the
council
but
i
was
old
enough
to
understand
what
was
passing
there
and
to
perceive
that
it
was
the
price
for
which
he
sold
his
country
however
as
scotland
acknowledged
him
sovereign
and
as
bruce
submitted
my
grandfather
silently
acquiesced
but
baliol
did
not
forget
former
opposition
his
behavior
to
sir
ronald
and
myself
at
the
beginning
of
this
year
when
according
to
the
privilege
of
our
birth
we
appeared
in
the
field
against
the
public
enemy
fully
demonstrated
what
was
the
injury
baliol
complains
of
and
how
unjustly
he
drove
us
from
the
standard
of
scotland
said
he
serve
under
me
who
presumed
to
declare
themselves
the
friends
of
bruce
poor
weak
man
the
purchased
vassal
of
england
yet
so
vain
of
his
ideal
throne
he
hated
all
who
had
opposed
his
elevation
even
while
his
own
treachery
sapped
its
foundation
edward
having
made
use
of
him
all
these
sacrifices
of
honor
and
of
conscience
are
insufficient
to
retain
his
favor
and
baliol
is
removed
from
his
kingdom
to
an
english
prison
can
i
feel
anything
so
honoring
as
indignation
against
a
wretch
so
abject
no
i
do
indeed
pity
him
and
now
that
i
have
cleared
my
grandfather
name
of
such
calumny
i
am
ready
to
hear
you
further
monteith
after
remarking
on
the
honor
of
sir
ronald
crawford
resumed
during
the
massacre
at
the
capture
of
berwick
lord
douglas
wounded
and
nearly
insensible
was
taken
by
a
trusty
band
of
scots
out
of
the
citadel
and
town
i
followed
him
to
dunbar
and
witnessed
with
him
that
dreadful
day
conflict
which
completed
the
triumph
of
the
english
when
the
few
nobles
who
survived
the
battle
dispersed
douglas
took
the
road
to
forfar
hoping
to
meet
king
baliol
there
and
to
concert
with
him
new
plans
of
resistance
when
we
arrived
we
found
his
majesty
in
close
conversation
with
the
earl
of
athol
who
had
persuaded
him
the
disaster
at
dunbar
was
decisive
and
that
if
he
wished
to
save
his
life
he
must
immediately
go
to
the
king
of
england
then
at
montrose
and
surrender
himself
to
his
mercy
treacherous
scot
who
persuaded
baliol
to
his
ruin
was
john
cummin
of
strathbogie
earl
of
athol
in
right
of
his
wife
the
heiress
of
that
douglas
tried
to
alter
baliol
resolution
but
without
effect
the
king
could
not
return
any
reasonable
answers
to
the
arguments
which
were
offered
to
induce
him
to
remain
but
continued
to
repeat
with
groans
and
tears
is
my
fate
athol
sat
knitting
his
black
brows
during
this
conversation
and
at
last
throwing
out
some
sullen
remarks
to
lord
douglas
on
exhorting
the
king
to
defy
his
liege
lord
he
abruptly
left
the
room
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
baliol
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
very
anxious
countenance
and
taking
my
patron
into
an
adjoining
room
they
continued
there
a
few
minutes
and
then
reentered
doublas
brought
with
him
this
iron
box
said
he
confide
this
to
your
care
putting
the
box
under
my
arm
and
concealing
it
with
my
cloak
it
continued
he
to
my
castle
in
lanarkshire
i
will
rejoin
you
there
in
hours
after
your
arrival
meanwhile
by
your
affection
for
me
and
fidelity
to
your
king
breathe
not
a
word
of
what
has
passed
on
that
and
be
faithful
said
baliol
putting
this
ruby
ring
on
my
finger
i
withdrew
with
the
haste
his
look
dictated
and
as
i
crossed
the
outward
hall
was
met
by
athol
he
eyed
me
sternly
and
inquired
whither
i
was
going
i
replied
douglas
to
prepare
for
the
coming
of
its
lord
the
hall
was
full
of
armed
men
in
colors
not
one
of
the
remnant
who
had
followed
my
patron
from
the
bloody
field
of
dunbar
was
visible
athol
looked
round
on
his
myrmidons
cried
he
that
you
speed
this
fellow
on
his
journey
we
shall
provide
lodgings
for
his
master
i
foresaw
danger
to
lord
douglas
but
i
durst
not
attempt
to
warn
him
of
it
and
to
secure
my
charge
which
a
return
to
the
room
might
have
hazarded
i
hastened
into
the
courtyard
and
being
permitted
to
mount
my
horse
set
off
at
full
speed
on
arriving
at
this
place
i
remembered
the
secret
closet
and
carefully
deposited
the
box
within
it
a
week
passed
without
any
tidings
of
lord
douglas
at
last
a
pilgrim
appeared
at
the
gate
and
requested
to
see
me
alone
fearing
nothing
from
a
man
in
so
sacred
a
habit
i
admitted
him
presenting
me
with
a
packet
which
had
been
intrusted
to
him
by
lord
douglas
he
told
me
my
patron
had
been
forcibly
carried
on
board
a
vessel
at
montrose
to
be
conveyed
with
the
unhappy
baliol
to
the
tower
of
london
douglas
on
this
outrage
sent
to
the
monastery
at
aberbrothick
and
under
the
pretense
of
making
a
religious
confession
before
he
sailed
begged
a
visit
from
the
am
that
prior
continued
the
pilgrim
having
been
born
on
the
douglas
lands
he
well
knew
the
claim
he
had
to
my
fidelity
he
gave
me
this
packet
and
conjured
me
to
lose
no
time
in
conveying
it
to
you
the
task
was
difficult
and
as
in
these
calamitous
seasons
we
hardly
know
whom
to
trust
i
determined
to
execute
it
myself
i
inquired
whether
lord
douglas
had
actually
sailed
replied
the
father
stood
on
the
beach
till
the
ship
disappeared
a
groan
burst
from
the
indignant
breast
of
wallace
it
interrupted
monteith
for
an
instant
but
without
noticing
it
he
proceeded
not
only
the
brave
douglas
was
then
wrested
from
his
country
with
our
king
but
also
that
holy
pillar
of
which
prophets
have
declared
to
be
the
palladium
of
scotland
tradition
respecting
this
stone
is
as
follows
hiber
or
iber
the
phoenician
who
came
from
the
holy
land
to
inhabit
the
coast
of
spain
brought
this
sacred
relic
along
with
him
from
spain
he
transplanted
it
with
the
colony
he
sent
to
people
the
south
of
ireland
and
from
ireland
it
was
brought
into
scotland
by
the
great
fergus
the
son
of
ferchard
he
placed
it
in
argyleshire
but
macalpine
removed
it
to
scone
and
fixed
it
in
the
royal
chair
in
which
all
the
succeeding
kings
of
scotland
were
inaugurated
edward
of
england
caused
it
to
be
carried
to
westminster
abbey
where
it
now
stands
the
tradition
is
that
empire
abides
where
it
what
inquired
wallace
with
a
yet
darker
frown
has
baliol
robbed
scotland
of
that
trophy
of
one
of
her
best
kings
is
the
sacred
gift
of
fergus
to
be
made
the
spoil
of
a
coward
baliol
is
not
the
robber
rejoined
monteith
the
halloed
pillar
was
taken
from
scone
by
the
command
of
the
king
of
england
and
with
the
sackings
of
iona
was
carried
on
board
the
same
vessel
with
the
betrayed
douglas
the
archives
of
the
kingdom
have
also
been
torn
from
their
sanctuary
and
were
thrown
by
edward
own
hands
into
the
fire
tyrant
murmured
wallace
thou
mayest
fill
the
cup
too
full
his
depredations
continued
monteith
the
good
monk
told
me
have
been
wide
as
destructive
he
has
not
left
a
parchment
either
of
public
records
or
of
private
annals
in
any
of
the
monasteries
or
castles
round
montrose
all
have
been
searched
and
plundered
and
besides
the
faithless
earl
of
march
and
lord
sculis
are
such
parricides
of
their
country
as
to
have
performed
the
like
robberies
in
his
name
from
the
eastern
shores
of
the
highlands
to
the
furthiest
of
the
western
isles
do
the
traitors
think
cried
wallace
that
by
robbing
scotland
of
her
annals
and
of
that
stone
they
really
deprive
her
of
her
palladium
scotland
history
is
in
the
memories
of
her
sons
her
palladium
is
in
their
hearts
and
edward
may
one
day
find
that
she
remembers
the
victory
of
largs
and
needs
not
talismans
to
give
her
freedom
battle
was
fought
by
alexander
iii
on
the
of
august
against
acho
king
of
norway
that
monarch
invaded
scotland
with
a
large
army
and
drew
up
his
forces
before
largs
a
town
in
ayrshire
he
met
with
a
great
defeat
and
covered
with
disgrace
retired
to
his
own
country
wallace
father
signalized
himself
on
that
alas
not
in
our
time
answered
monteith
the
spear
is
at
our
breasts
and
we
must
submit
you
see
this
castle
is
full
of
soldiers
every
house
is
a
garrison
for
england
but
more
of
this
by
and
by
i
have
yet
to
tell
you
the
contents
of
the
packet
which
the
monk
brought
it
contained
two
others
one
directed
to
sir
james
douglas
at
paris
and
the
other
to
me
i
read
as
follows
has
persuaded
baliol
to
his
ruin
and
betrayed
me
into
the
hands
of
edward
i
shall
see
scotland
no
more
send
the
inclosed
to
my
son
at
paris
it
will
inform
him
what
is
the
last
wish
of
william
douglas
for
his
country
the
iron
box
i
confided
to
you
guard
as
your
life
until
you
can
deposit
it
with
my
son
but
should
he
remain
abroad
and
you
ever
be
in
extremity
commit
the
box
in
strict
charge
to
the
worthiest
scot
you
know
and
tell
him
that
it
will
be
at
the
peril
of
his
soul
who
dares
to
open
it
till
scotland
be
again
free
when
that
hour
comes
then
let
the
man
by
whose
valor
god
restores
her
rights
receive
the
box
as
his
own
for
by
him
only
it
is
to
be
opened
douglas
monteith
finished
reading
the
letter
and
remained
silent
wallace
who
had
listened
to
it
with
increasing
indignation
against
the
enemies
of
scotland
spoke
first
tell
me
in
what
i
can
assist
you
or
how
serve
these
last
wishes
of
the
imprisoned
douglas
monteith
replied
by
reading
over
again
this
my
son
remain
abroad
and
you
ever
be
in
extremity
commit
the
box
in
strict
charge
to
the
worthiest
scot
you
know
i
am
in
that
extremity
now
edward
determined
on
desolation
when
he
placed
english
governors
throughout
our
towns
and
the
rapacious
heselrigge
his
representative
in
lanark
not
backward
to
execute
the
despot
will
has
just
issued
an
order
for
the
houses
of
all
the
absent
chiefs
to
be
searched
for
records
and
secret
correspondence
two
or
three
in
the
neighborhood
have
already
gone
through
this
ordeal
but
the
even
has
proved
that
it
was
not
papers
they
sought
but
plunder
and
an
excuse
for
dismantling
the
castles
or
occupying
them
with
english
officers
the
soldiers
you
saw
were
sent
by
daybreak
this
morning
to
guard
this
castle
until
heselrigge
could
in
person
be
present
at
the
examination
this
ceremony
is
to
take
place
and
as
lord
douglas
is
considered
a
traitor
to
edward
i
am
told
the
place
will
be
sacked
to
its
walls
in
such
an
extremity
to
you
noble
wallace
as
to
the
worthiest
scot
i
know
i
apply
to
take
charge
of
this
box
within
the
remote
cliffs
of
ellerslie
it
must
be
safe
and
when
james
douglas
arrives
from
paris
to
him
you
will
resign
it
meanwhile
as
i
can
not
resist
the
plunderers
after
delivering
the
keys
of
the
state
apartments
to
heselrigge
i
shall
submit
to
necessity
and
beg
his
permission
to
retire
to
my
lodge
on
ben
venu
wallace
made
no
difficulty
in
granting
monteith
request
and
there
being
two
iron
rings
on
each
side
of
his
charge
the
young
chief
took
off
his
leathern
belt
and
putting
it
through
them
swung
the
box
easily
under
his
left
arm
while
covering
it
with
his
plaid
monteith
eyes
now
brightened
the
paleness
left
his
cheek
and
with
a
firmer
step
as
if
suddenly
relieved
of
a
heavy
load
he
called
a
servant
to
prepare
sir
william
wallace
attendants
while
wallace
shook
him
by
the
hand
monteith
in
a
low
and
solemn
voice
exhorted
him
to
caution
respecting
the
box
remember
added
he
the
penalty
that
hangs
over
him
who
looks
into
it
be
not
afraid
answered
wallace
even
the
outside
shall
never
be
seen
by
other
eyes
than
my
own
unless
the
same
circumstance
which
now
induces
you
mortal
extremity
should
force
me
to
confide
it
to
safer
hands
beware
of
that
exclaimed
monteith
for
who
is
there
that
would
adhere
to
the
prohibition
as
i
have
done
as
you
will
do
and
besides
as
i
have
no
doubt
it
contains
holy
relics
who
knows
what
new
calamities
a
sacrilegious
look
might
bring
upon
our
already
devoted
country
relics
or
no
relics
replied
wallace
it
would
be
an
equal
sin
against
good
faith
to
invade
what
is
forbidden
but
from
the
weight
i
am
rather
inclined
to
suspect
it
contains
gold
probably
a
treasure
with
which
the
sordid
baliol
thinks
to
compensate
the
hero
who
may
free
his
country
from
all
the
miseries
a
traitor
king
and
a
treacherous
usurper
have
brought
upon
it
a
treasure
repeated
monteith
i
never
thought
of
that
is
indeed
heavy
as
we
are
responsible
for
the
contents
of
the
box
i
wish
we
were
certain
of
what
it
contains
let
us
consider
that
it
is
no
consideration
of
ours
returned
wallace
with
what
is
in
the
box
we
have
no
concern
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
preserve
the
contents
unviolated
by
even
our
own
eyes
and
to
that
as
you
have
now
transferred
the
charge
to
me
i
pledge
myself
farewell
but
why
this
haste
rejoined
monteith
indeed
i
wish
i
had
thought
stay
only
a
little
i
thank
you
returned
wallace
proceeding
to
the
courtyard
but
it
is
now
dark
and
i
promised
to
be
at
home
before
the
moon
rises
if
you
wish
me
to
serve
you
further
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
you
at
ellerslie
my
marion
will
have
pleasure
in
entertaining
for
days
or
weeks
the
friend
of
her
husband
while
wallace
spoke
he
advanced
to
his
horse
to
which
he
was
lighted
by
the
servants
of
the
castle
a
few
english
soldiers
lingered
about
in
idle
curiosity
as
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
held
the
sword
in
his
hand
which
he
had
unbuckled
from
his
side
to
leave
space
for
his
charge
monteith
whose
dread
of
detection
was
ever
awake
whispered
your
loosened
weapon
may
excite
suspicion
fear
incurred
what
it
sought
to
avoid
he
hastily
pulled
aside
wallace
plaid
to
throw
it
over
the
glittering
hilt
of
the
sword
and
thus
exposed
the
iron
box
the
light
of
the
torches
striking
upon
the
polished
rivets
displayed
it
to
all
lookers
on
but
no
remark
was
made
wallace
not
observing
what
was
done
again
shook
hands
with
monteith
and
calling
his
servants
about
him
galloped
away
a
murmur
was
heard
as
if
of
some
intention
to
follow
him
but
deeming
it
prudent
to
leave
the
open
and
direct
road
because
of
the
english
marauders
who
swarmed
there
he
was
presently
lost
amid
the
thick
shades
of
clydesdale
chapter
ii
lanark
the
darkness
was
almost
impenetrable
musing
on
what
had
passed
with
monteith
and
on
the
likelihood
of
any
hero
appearing
who
by
freeing
his
country
could
ever
claim
the
privilege
of
investigating
the
mystery
which
was
now
his
care
wallace
rode
on
till
crossing
the
bridge
of
lanark
he
saw
the
rising
moon
silver
the
tops
of
the
distant
hills
and
then
his
meditations
embraced
a
gentler
subject
this
was
the
time
he
had
promised
marion
he
should
be
returned
and
he
had
yet
five
long
miles
to
go
before
he
could
reach
the
glen
of
ellerslie
he
thought
of
her
being
alone
of
watching
with
an
anxious
heart
the
minutes
of
his
delay
scotland
and
its
wrongs
he
now
forgot
in
the
idea
of
her
whose
happiness
was
dearer
to
him
than
life
he
could
not
achieve
the
deliverance
of
the
one
but
it
was
his
bliss
to
preserve
the
peace
of
the
other
and
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
under
the
now
bright
beams
of
the
moon
he
hastened
through
the
town
abruptly
turning
an
angle
leading
to
the
mouse
river
a
cry
of
murder
arrested
his
ear
he
checked
his
horse
and
listened
the
clashing
of
arms
told
him
the
sound
had
issued
from
an
alley
to
the
left
he
alighted
in
an
instant
and
drawing
his
sword
threw
away
the
scabbard
prophetic
omen
then
leaving
his
horse
with
one
of
his
servants
hastened
with
the
other
three
to
the
spot
whence
the
noise
proceeded
on
arriving
he
discovered
two
men
in
tartans
with
their
backs
to
the
opposite
wall
furiously
assaulted
by
a
throng
of
edward
soldiers
at
this
sight
the
scots
who
accompanied
wallace
were
so
enraged
that
blowing
their
bugles
to
encourage
the
assailed
they
joined
hand
to
hand
with
their
gallant
leader
and
attacking
the
banditti
each
man
cut
his
opponent
to
the
ground
such
unexpected
assistance
reanimated
the
drooping
strength
of
one
of
the
two
with
whom
the
cry
had
issued
he
sprung
from
the
wall
with
the
vigor
of
a
tiger
but
at
the
moment
received
a
wound
in
his
back
which
would
have
thrown
him
at
the
feet
of
his
enemies
had
not
wallace
caught
him
in
his
left
arm
and
with
his
right
cleared
the
way
while
he
cried
to
his
men
who
were
fighting
near
to
the
glen
as
he
spoke
he
threw
the
now
insensible
stranger
into
their
arms
the
other
man
whose
voice
had
first
attracted
wallace
at
the
instant
sunk
covered
with
blood
on
the
pavement
two
of
the
servants
obeying
their
master
carried
their
senseless
burden
toward
the
horses
but
the
third
being
hemmed
in
by
the
furious
soldiers
could
not
move
wallace
made
a
passage
to
his
rescue
and
effected
it
but
one
base
wretch
while
the
now
wounded
scot
was
retreating
made
a
stroke
which
would
have
severed
his
head
from
his
body
had
not
the
trusty
claymore
of
wallace
struck
down
the
pending
weapon
of
the
coward
and
received
his
rushing
body
upon
its
point
he
fell
with
bitter
imprecations
calling
aloud
for
vengeance
a
dreadful
cry
was
now
raised
by
the
whole
band
of
assassins
murder
heselrigge
is
slain
the
uproar
became
general
the
windows
of
the
adjoining
houses
were
thrown
open
people
armed
and
unarmed
issued
from
their
doors
and
pressed
forward
to
inquire
the
cause
of
the
alarm
wallace
was
nearly
overpowered
a
hundred
swords
flashed
in
the
torchlight
but
at
the
moment
he
expected
they
would
be
sheathed
in
his
heart
the
earth
gave
way
under
his
feet
and
he
sunk
into
utter
darkness
he
fell
upon
a
quantity
of
gathered
broom
and
concluding
that
the
weight
of
the
thronging
multitude
had
burst
his
way
through
the
arch
of
a
cellar
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
though
he
heard
the
curses
of
several
wretches
who
had
fallen
with
him
and
fared
worse
he
made
but
one
step
to
a
door
pointed
out
to
him
by
a
gleam
from
an
inner
passage
the
men
uttered
a
shout
as
they
saw
him
darken
the
light
which
glimmered
through
it
but
they
were
incapable
of
pursuit
and
wallace
aware
of
his
danger
darting
across
the
adjoining
apartment
burst
open
a
window
and
leaped
out
to
the
foot
of
the
lanark
hills
the
oaths
of
the
soldiers
enraged
at
his
escape
echoed
in
his
ears
till
distance
sunk
them
into
hoarse
murmurs
he
pursued
his
way
over
the
craigs
through
the
valley
and
across
the
river
to
the
cliffs
which
embattle
the
garden
of
ellerslie
springing
on
the
projecting
point
of
the
nearest
he
leaped
into
a
thicket
of
honeysuckles
this
was
the
favorite
bower
of
his
marion
the
soft
perfume
as
it
saluted
his
senses
seemed
to
breathe
peace
and
safety
and
as
he
emerged
from
its
fragrant
embrace
he
walked
with
a
calmer
step
toward
the
house
he
approached
a
door
which
led
into
the
garden
it
was
open
he
beheld
his
beloved
leaning
over
a
couch
on
which
was
laid
the
person
he
had
rescued
halbert
was
dressing
his
wounds
wallace
paused
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
his
lovely
wife
in
this
more
lovely
act
of
charity
her
beautiful
hands
held
a
cup
to
the
lips
of
the
stranger
while
her
long
hair
escaped
from
its
band
fell
in
jetty
ringlets
and
mingled
with
his
silver
locks
marion
exclaimed
the
overflowing
soul
of
her
husband
she
looked
up
at
the
sound
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
rushing
forward
threw
herself
into
his
arms
her
tears
flowed
she
sobbed
she
clung
to
his
breast
it
was
the
first
time
wallace
had
been
from
her
she
had
feared
it
would
have
been
the
last
the
hour
the
conflict
the
bleeding
stranger
but
now
he
was
returned
he
was
safe
art
thou
indeed
here
exclaimed
she
blood
fell
from
his
forehead
upon
her
face
and
bosom
o
my
wallace
cried
she
in
agony
fear
not
my
love
all
is
well
since
our
wounded
countryman
is
safe
but
you
bleed
returned
she
no
tears
now
impeded
her
voice
terror
had
checked
their
joyful
currents
and
she
felt
as
if
she
expected
his
to
issue
from
the
wound
on
which
she
gazed
i
hope
my
preserver
is
not
hurt
inquired
the
stranger
oh
no
replied
wallace
putting
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
a
mere
trifle
that
the
action
had
discovered
the
gash
to
be
wider
than
he
thought
he
saw
in
the
countenance
of
his
wife
she
turned
deadly
pale
marion
said
he
to
convince
you
how
causeless
your
fears
are
you
shall
cure
me
yourself
and
with
no
other
surgery
than
your
girdle
when
lady
wallace
heard
his
gay
tone
and
saw
the
unforced
smiles
on
his
lips
she
took
courage
and
remembering
the
deep
wounds
on
the
stranger
whom
she
had
just
assisted
to
dress
without
any
alarm
for
his
life
she
began
to
hope
that
she
need
not
now
fear
for
the
object
dearest
to
her
in
existence
rising
from
her
husband
arms
with
a
languid
smile
she
unbound
the
linen
fillet
from
her
waist
and
halbert
having
poured
some
balsam
into
the
wound
she
prepared
to
apply
the
bandage
but
when
she
lifted
her
husband
hair
from
his
temple
that
hair
which
had
so
often
been
the
object
of
her
admiration
as
it
hung
in
shining
masses
over
his
arching
brows
the
clotted
blood
met
her
fingers
a
mist
seemed
to
pass
over
her
sight
she
paused
for
a
moment
but
rallying
her
strength
as
the
cheerful
sound
of
his
voice
conversing
with
his
guest
assured
her
fear
was
needless
she
tied
the
fillet
and
stealing
a
soft
kiss
on
his
cheek
when
she
had
finished
she
seated
herself
yet
trembling
by
his
side
gallant
wallace
continued
the
had
prevented
her
hearing
what
had
preceded
it
is
donald
earl
of
mar
who
owes
his
life
to
you
then
blessed
be
my
arm
exclaimed
wallace
that
has
preserved
a
life
so
precious
to
my
country
may
it
indeed
be
blessed
cried
lord
mar
for
this
night
it
has
made
the
southrons
feel
there
is
yet
one
man
in
scotland
who
does
not
fear
to
resist
oppression
and
to
punish
treachery
what
treachery
inquired
lady
wallace
her
alarmed
spirit
still
hovering
about
her
soul
far
dearer
part
is
any
meant
to
my
husband
none
to
sir
william
wallace
more
than
to
any
other
brave
scot
replied
the
earl
but
we
all
see
the
oppression
of
our
country
we
all
know
the
treachery
by
which
it
was
subjugated
and
this
night
in
my
own
person
i
have
felt
the
effects
of
both
the
english
at
lanark
dispatched
a
body
of
men
to
bothwell
castle
where
my
family
now
are
on
a
plea
that
as
its
lord
is
yet
absent
they
presume
he
is
adverse
to
edward
and
therefore
they
must
search
his
dwelling
for
documents
to
settle
the
point
considering
myself
the
representative
of
my
lord
bothwell
and
suspecting
that
this
might
be
only
a
private
marauding
party
i
refused
to
admit
the
soldiers
and
saw
them
depart
swearing
to
return
next
day
with
a
stronger
force
and
storm
the
castle
to
be
ascertained
of
their
commission
and
to
appeal
against
such
unprovoked
tyranny
should
it
be
true
i
followed
the
detachment
to
lanark
i
saw
heselrigge
the
governor
he
avowed
the
transaction
but
awed
by
the
power
which
he
thinks
i
possess
in
the
country
he
consented
to
spare
bothwell
while
i
and
my
family
remain
in
it
it
being
nearly
dark
i
took
my
leave
and
was
proceeding
toward
my
servants
in
the
courtyard
when
a
young
man
accosted
me
i
recognized
him
to
be
the
officer
who
had
commanded
the
party
i
had
driven
from
the
castle
heselrigge
having
told
me
that
he
was
his
nephew
i
made
no
hesitation
to
go
back
with
him
when
he
informed
me
that
his
uncle
had
forgotten
something
of
importance
and
begged
me
to
return
i
followed
his
steps
but
instead
of
conducting
me
to
the
room
in
which
i
had
conversed
with
heselrigge
he
led
me
along
a
dark
passage
into
a
small
apartment
where
telling
me
his
uncle
would
attend
me
he
suddenly
retreated
out
of
the
door
and
before
i
could
recollect
myself
i
heard
him
bolt
it
after
him
i
now
saw
myself
a
prisoner
and
alarmed
at
what
might
be
intended
to
my
defenseless
family
i
made
every
essay
to
force
the
door
but
it
was
in
vain
driven
to
despair
i
remained
in
a
state
of
mind
not
to
be
described
when
the
bolt
was
withdrawn
and
two
men
entered
with
manacles
in
their
hands
they
attempted
to
seize
me
telling
me
i
was
the
prisoner
of
king
edward
i
did
not
listen
further
but
wounding
one
with
my
dagger
felled
the
other
to
the
ground
and
darting
past
him
made
my
way
through
what
passages
i
can
not
tell
till
i
found
myself
in
a
street
leading
from
behind
the
governor
house
i
ran
against
some
one
as
i
rushed
from
the
portal
it
was
my
servant
neil
i
hastily
told
him
to
draw
his
sword
and
follow
me
we
then
hurried
forward
he
telling
me
he
had
stepped
out
to
observe
the
night
while
the
rest
of
my
men
were
awaiting
me
in
the
house
wondering
at
my
delay
rejoiced
at
my
escape
and
fearing
the
worst
of
consequences
from
the
treachery
of
heselrigge
i
was
hastening
onward
determined
to
pursue
my
way
on
foot
to
the
protection
of
my
family
when
at
the
turning
of
an
angle
which
leads
to
the
bothwell
road
we
were
suddenly
surrounded
by
armed
men
the
moon
shone
full
on
their
faces
and
i
discovered
they
were
southrons
and
that
young
heselrigge
was
at
their
head
he
aimed
a
blow
at
my
head
with
his
and
in
a
voice
of
triumph
exclaimed
to
his
soldiers
plunder
of
bothwell
my
lads
down
with
its
lord
all
but
the
lady
helen
shall
be
yours
in
a
moment
every
sword
was
directed
toward
me
they
wounded
me
in
several
places
but
the
thought
of
my
daughter
gave
supernatural
vigor
to
my
arm
and
i
defended
myself
till
the
cries
of
my
servant
brought
you
my
brave
deliverer
to
my
rescue
but
while
i
am
safe
perhaps
my
treacherous
pursuer
has
marched
toward
bothwell
too
sure
to
commit
the
horrid
violence
he
meditates
there
are
none
to
guard
my
child
but
a
few
domestics
the
unpracticed
sword
of
my
stripling
nephew
and
the
feeble
arms
of
my
wife
be
easy
on
that
head
interrupted
wallace
i
believe
the
infamous
leader
of
the
banditti
fell
by
my
hand
for
the
soldiers
made
an
outcry
that
arthur
heselrigge
was
killed
and
then
pressing
on
me
to
take
revenge
their
weight
broke
a
passage
into
a
vault
through
which
i
save
save
yourself
my
master
cried
a
man
rushing
in
from
the
garden
you
are
while
he
spoke
he
felt
insensible
at
wallace
feet
it
was
dugald
whom
he
had
rescued
from
the
blow
of
heselrigge
and
who
from
the
state
of
his
wound
had
been
thus
long
in
reaching
ellerslie
wallace
had
hardly
time
to
give
him
to
the
care
of
halbert
when
the
voice
of
war
assailed
his
ears
the
tumult
of
men
demanding
admittance
and
the
terrible
sound
of
spears
rattling
against
the
shields
of
their
owners
told
the
astonished
group
within
that
the
house
was
beset
by
armed
foes
blood
for
blood
cried
a
horrid
voice
which
penetrated
the
almost
palsied
senses
of
lady
marion
vengence
on
wallace
for
the
murder
of
heselrigge
fly
fly
cried
she
looking
wildly
at
her
husband
whither
answered
he
supporting
her
in
his
arms
would
this
be
a
moment
to
leave
you
and
our
wounded
guest
i
must
meet
them
not
now
cried
lord
mar
hear
you
not
how
numerous
they
are
mark
that
shout
they
thirst
for
blood
if
you
have
love
pity
for
your
wife
delay
not
a
moment
the
uproar
redoubled
and
the
room
was
instantly
filled
with
shrieking
women
in
their
the
attendants
of
lady
wallace
she
almost
expiring
on
her
husband
breast
o
my
lord
cried
the
terrified
creatures
wringing
their
hands
what
will
become
of
us
the
southrons
are
at
the
gates
and
we
shall
be
lost
forever
fear
not
replied
wallace
retire
to
your
chambers
i
am
the
person
they
seek
none
else
will
meet
with
injury
appeased
by
this
assurance
the
women
retreated
to
their
apartments
and
wallace
turning
to
the
earl
who
continued
to
enforce
the
necessity
of
his
flight
repeated
that
he
would
not
consent
to
leave
his
wife
in
such
a
tumult
leave
me
cried
she
in
an
inarticulate
voice
or
see
me
die
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
violent
crash
and
a
tremendous
burst
of
imprecations
three
of
wallace
men
ran
panting
into
the
room
two
of
the
assailants
had
climbed
to
the
hall
window
and
had
just
been
thrown
back
upon
the
cliffs
where
one
was
killed
conceal
yourself
said
the
scots
to
wallace
for
in
a
few
minutes
more
your
men
will
not
be
able
to
maintain
the
gates
yes
my
dear
lord
cried
halbert
there
is
a
dry
well
at
the
end
of
the
garden
at
the
bottom
of
that
you
will
be
safe
by
your
love
for
me
wallace
by
all
you
owe
to
the
tender
affections
of
your
grandfather
hearken
to
him
cried
lady
marion
falling
at
his
feet
and
clasping
his
knees
i
kneel
for
my
life
in
kneeling
for
yours
pity
the
gray
hairs
of
sir
ronald
whom
your
untimely
death
would
bring
to
the
grave
pity
your
unborn
child
fly
wallace
fly
if
you
would
have
me
live
she
was
pale
and
breathless
angel
of
my
life
exclaimed
wallace
straining
her
to
his
heart
i
obey
thee
but
if
the
hand
of
one
of
the
desperate
robbers
dares
to
touch
thy
hallowed
think
not
so
my
lord
interrupted
halbert
it
is
you
they
seek
not
finding
you
they
will
be
too
eager
in
pursuit
to
molest
your
lady
i
shall
be
safe
whispered
marion
only
fly
while
you
are
here
their
shouts
kill
me
but
thou
shalt
go
with
me
returned
he
the
well
will
contain
us
all
but
first
let
our
faithful
halbert
and
these
honest
fellows
lower
lord
mar
into
the
place
of
refuge
he
being
the
cause
of
the
affray
if
discovered
would
be
immediately
sacrificed
lord
mar
acquiesced
and
while
the
contention
was
so
loud
without
as
to
threaten
the
tearing
down
of
the
walls
the
earl
was
carried
into
the
garden
he
was
followed
by
sir
william
wallace
to
whose
arm
his
wife
yet
fondly
clung
at
every
cry
of
the
enemy
at
every
shock
they
gave
to
his
yet
impregnable
gates
she
breathed
the
shorter
and
was
clasped
by
the
lord
of
her
heart
still
more
closely
to
his
bosom
at
the
they
found
the
earl
bound
with
rope
that
was
to
lower
him
to
the
bottom
by
great
care
it
was
safely
done
and
the
cord
being
brought
up
again
before
it
was
tied
round
wallace
for
his
agonized
wife
insisted
he
should
descend
next
he
recollected
that
the
iron
box
at
his
side
might
hurt
the
wounded
nobleman
by
striking
him
in
his
descent
and
unbuckling
it
he
said
it
contained
matters
of
great
value
and
ordered
it
to
be
lowered
first
lord
mar
beneath
was
releasing
it
from
the
rope
when
a
shout
of
triumph
pierced
their
ears
a
party
of
the
english
having
come
round
the
heights
had
leaped
the
wall
of
the
garden
and
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
well
for
wallace
to
descend
now
was
impossible
that
tree
whispered
marion
pointing
to
an
near
which
they
stood
as
she
spoke
she
slid
from
his
arms
and
along
with
the
venerable
halbert
who
had
seized
her
hand
disappeared
amid
the
adjoining
thicket
the
two
servants
fled
also
wallace
finding
himself
alone
the
next
instant
like
one
of
his
native
eagles
was
looking
down
from
the
towering
top
of
the
wood
upon
his
enemies
they
passed
beneath
him
denouncing
vengeance
upon
the
assassin
of
arthur
heselrigge
one
who
by
the
brightness
of
his
armor
seemed
to
be
their
leader
stopped
under
the
tree
and
complained
he
had
so
sprained
his
ankle
in
leaping
the
wall
he
must
wait
a
few
minutes
to
recover
himself
several
soldiers
drew
toward
him
but
he
ordered
them
to
pursue
their
duty
search
the
house
and
bring
wallace
dead
or
alive
before
him
they
obeyed
but
others
who
had
gained
admittance
to
the
tower
through
the
now
forced
gates
soon
ran
to
him
with
information
that
the
murderer
could
nowhere
be
found
but
here
is
a
gay
ladie
cried
one
perhaps
she
can
tell
of
his
and
at
moment
marion
with
halbert
appeared
amongst
a
band
of
men
the
lighted
torches
which
the
soldiers
held
shone
full
on
her
face
though
pale
as
monumental
marble
the
exquisite
beauty
of
her
features
and
the
calm
dignity
which
commanded
from
her
eyes
awed
the
officer
into
respect
and
admiration
soldiers
stand
back
cried
he
advancing
to
lady
wallace
fear
not
madam
as
the
words
passed
his
lips
a
flight
of
arrows
flew
into
the
bosom
of
the
tree
a
piercing
shriek
from
marion
was
her
only
answer
hah
my
lady
falcon
cried
halbert
alarmed
doubly
for
the
fate
of
his
master
a
sudden
agitation
of
the
branches
having
excited
an
indefinite
suspicion
in
a
body
of
archers
who
stood
near
with
one
impulse
they
had
discharged
their
arrows
to
the
spot
halbert
ready
excuse
both
for
the
disturbance
in
the
tree
and
his
lady
shriek
was
prompted
and
warranted
true
by
the
appearance
of
a
large
bird
which
the
rushing
of
the
arrows
had
frighted
from
her
nest
she
rose
suddenly
from
amongst
the
branches
and
soared
away
far
to
the
east
with
loud
screams
all
being
again
still
marion
hoped
that
her
husband
had
escaped
any
serious
injury
from
the
arrows
and
turning
with
recovered
composure
to
the
officer
heard
him
with
a
glow
of
comfort
reprimand
his
men
for
daring
to
draw
their
bows
without
his
orders
then
addressing
her
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
said
he
both
for
the
alarm
these
men
have
occasioned
you
and
for
the
violence
they
have
committed
in
forcing
one
of
your
sex
and
beauty
before
me
had
i
expected
to
have
found
a
lady
here
i
should
have
issued
orders
to
have
prevented
this
outrage
but
i
am
sent
hither
in
quest
of
sir
william
wallace
who
by
a
mortal
attack
made
on
the
person
of
the
governor
of
lanark
nephew
has
forfeited
his
life
the
scabbard
of
his
sword
found
beside
the
murdered
heselrigge
is
an
undeniable
proof
of
his
guilt
direct
us
to
find
him
and
not
only
your
release
but
the
favor
of
the
english
monarch
will
await
your
allegiance
i
am
sir
william
wallace
wife
returned
the
gentle
marion
in
a
firm
tone
and
by
what
authority
you
seek
him
thus
and
presume
to
call
him
guilty
i
can
not
understand
by
the
authority
of
the
laws
madam
which
he
has
violated
what
laws
rejoined
she
sir
william
wallace
acknowledges
none
but
those
of
god
and
his
country
neither
of
these
has
he
transgressed
the
officer
replied
this
night
he
assassinated
arthur
heselrigge
in
the
streets
of
lanark
and
that
condemns
him
by
the
last
declaration
of
king
edward
whatever
scot
maltreats
any
one
of
the
english
soldiers
or
civil
officers
garrisoned
in
the
towns
of
scotland
shall
thereby
forfeit
his
life
as
the
penalty
of
his
crime
a
tyrant
law
sir
to
which
no
freeborn
scot
will
submit
but
even
were
it
allowed
by
my
countrymen
in
this
case
it
can
have
no
hold
on
my
husband
that
he
is
a
scot
he
glories
and
not
that
he
maltreated
any
englishman
in
the
streets
of
lanark
do
i
glory
but
because
when
he
saw
two
defenseless
men
borne
down
by
a
band
of
armed
soldiers
he
exposed
his
unshielded
breast
in
their
defense
one
of
the
two
died
covered
with
wounds
that
the
governor
nephew
also
fell
was
a
just
retribution
for
his
heading
so
unequal
a
contest
and
no
crime
in
sir
william
wallace
for
he
slew
him
to
preserve
a
feeble
old
man
who
had
a
hundred
english
swords
leveled
at
his
life
the
officer
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
ordering
his
soldiers
to
fall
further
back
when
they
were
at
a
sufficient
distance
he
offered
to
take
lady
wallace
hand
she
withstood
his
motion
with
a
reserved
air
and
said
speak
sir
what
you
would
say
or
allow
me
to
retire
i
mean
not
to
offend
you
noble
lady
continued
he
had
i
a
wife
lovely
as
yourself
and
i
in
like
circumstances
i
hope
in
the
like
manner
would
defend
my
life
and
honor
i
knew
not
the
particulars
of
the
affair
in
which
arthur
heselrigge
fell
till
i
heard
it
from
your
lips
i
can
easily
credit
them
for
i
know
his
unmanly
character
wallace
is
a
scot
and
acted
in
scotland
as
gilbert
hambledon
would
have
done
in
england
were
it
possible
for
any
vile
foreigner
to
there
put
his
foot
upon
the
neck
of
a
countryman
of
mine
wherever
you
have
concealed
your
husband
let
it
be
a
distant
asylum
at
present
no
tract
within
the
jurisdiction
of
lanark
will
be
left
unsearched
by
the
governor
indefatigable
revenge
lady
wallace
overcome
with
gratitude
at
this
generous
speech
of
the
english
officer
uttered
some
inarticulate
words
expressive
more
in
sound
than
clearness
of
her
grateful
feelings
hambledon
continued
i
will
use
my
influence
with
heselrigge
to
prevent
the
interior
of
your
house
from
being
disturbed
again
but
it
being
in
the
course
of
military
operations
i
can
not
free
you
from
the
disagreeable
ceremony
of
a
guard
being
placed
morning
round
the
domains
this
i
know
will
be
done
to
intercept
sir
william
wallace
should
he
attempt
to
return
oh
that
he
were
indeed
far
distant
thought
the
anxious
marion
the
officer
then
added
however
you
shall
be
relieved
of
my
detachment
directly
and
as
he
spoke
he
waved
his
sword
to
them
who
had
seized
the
harper
they
advanced
still
holding
their
prisoner
he
ordered
them
to
commit
the
man
to
him
and
to
sound
the
trumpeter
obeyed
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
whole
detachment
were
assembled
before
their
commander
soldiers
cried
he
sir
william
wallace
has
escaped
our
hands
mount
your
horses
that
we
may
return
to
lanark
and
search
the
other
side
of
the
town
lead
forth
and
i
will
follow
the
troops
obeyed
and
falling
back
through
the
open
gates
left
sir
gilbert
hambledon
alone
with
lady
wallace
and
the
wondering
halbert
the
brave
young
man
took
the
now
no
longer
withdrawn
hand
of
the
grateful
marion
who
had
stood
trembling
while
so
many
of
her
mortal
enemies
were
assembled
under
the
place
of
his
concealment
noble
englishman
said
she
as
the
last
body
of
soldiers
passed
from
her
sight
i
can
not
enough
thank
you
for
this
generous
conduct
but
should
you
or
yours
be
ever
in
the
like
extremity
with
my
beloved
wallace
and
in
these
tyrannous
times
what
brave
spirit
can
answer
for
its
continued
safety
may
the
ear
which
has
heard
you
this
night
at
that
hour
repay
my
gratitude
sweet
lady
answered
hambledon
i
thank
you
for
your
prayer
god
is
indeed
the
benefactor
of
a
true
soldier
and
though
i
serve
my
king
and
obey
my
commanders
yet
it
is
only
to
the
lord
of
battles
that
i
look
for
a
sure
reward
and
whether
he
pay
me
here
with
victories
and
honors
or
take
my
soul
through
a
rent
in
my
breast
to
receive
my
laurel
in
paradise
it
is
all
one
to
gilbert
hambledon
but
the
night
is
cold
i
must
see
you
safe
within
your
own
doors
and
then
lady
farewell
lady
wallace
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
his
hand
and
with
redoubled
haste
as
she
heard
another
rustling
in
the
tree
above
her
head
hambledon
did
not
notice
it
but
desiring
halbert
to
follow
in
a
few
minutes
disappeared
with
the
agitated
marion
into
the
house
wallace
whose
spirit
could
ill
brook
the
sight
of
his
domains
filled
with
hostile
troops
and
the
wife
of
his
bosom
brought
a
prisoner
before
their
commander
would
instantly
have
braved
all
dangers
and
have
leaped
down
amongst
them
but
at
the
instant
he
placed
his
foot
on
a
lower
bough
to
make
a
spring
the
courteous
address
of
hambledon
to
his
wife
had
made
him
hesitate
he
listened
to
the
replies
of
his
marion
with
exultation
and
when
the
englishman
ordered
his
men
to
withdraw
and
delivered
himself
so
generously
respecting
the
safety
of
the
man
he
came
to
seize
wallace
could
hardly
prevent
a
brave
confidence
in
such
virtue
from
compelling
him
to
come
from
his
concealment
and
thank
his
noble
enemy
on
the
spot
but
in
consideration
that
such
disclosure
would
put
the
military
duty
and
the
generous
nature
of
the
officer
at
variance
he
desisted
with
such
an
agitation
of
spirits
that
the
boughs
had
again
shaken
under
him
and
reawakened
the
alarm
of
his
trembling
wife
omnipotent
virtue
exclaimed
wallace
to
himself
if
it
were
possible
that
thy
generous
spirit
could
animate
the
breast
of
an
invading
conqueror
how
soon
would
the
vanquished
cease
to
forget
their
former
freedom
and
learn
to
love
their
vassalage
this
man
nobleness
how
soon
has
it
quenched
the
flame
of
vengeance
with
which
when
i
ascended
this
tree
i
prayed
for
the
extirpation
of
every
follower
of
edward
sir
william
my
master
cried
a
voice
in
a
suppressed
tone
as
if
still
fearful
of
being
overheard
it
was
halbert
speak
my
dear
lord
are
you
safe
in
heart
and
body
returned
wallace
sliding
from
the
tree
and
leaping
on
the
ground
one
only
of
the
arrows
touched
me
and
that
merely
striking
my
bugle
fell
back
amongst
the
leaves
i
must
now
hasten
to
the
dearest
the
noblest
of
women
halbert
begged
him
to
stay
till
they
should
hear
the
retreat
from
the
english
trumpets
till
their
troops
are
out
of
sight
added
he
i
can
not
believe
you
safe
hark
cried
wallace
the
horses
are
now
descending
the
craig
that
must
satisfy
you
honest
halbert
with
these
words
he
flew
across
the
grass
and
entering
the
house
met
the
returning
marion
who
had
just
bade
farewell
to
hambledon
she
rushed
into
his
arms
and
with
the
excess
of
a
disturbed
and
uncertain
joy
fainted
on
his
neck
her
gentle
spirit
had
been
too
powerfully
excited
by
the
preceding
scenes
unaccustomed
to
tumult
of
any
king
and
nursed
in
the
bosom
of
fondness
till
now
no
blast
had
blown
on
her
tender
form
no
harshness
had
ever
ruffled
the
blissful
serenity
of
her
mind
what
then
was
the
shock
of
this
evening
violence
her
husband
pursued
as
a
murderer
herself
exposed
to
the
midnight
air
and
dragged
by
the
hands
of
merciless
soldiers
to
betray
the
man
she
loved
all
these
scenes
were
new
to
her
and
though
a
kind
of
preternatural
strength
had
supported
her
over
when
she
fell
once
more
into
her
husband
extended
arms
she
seemed
there
to
have
found
again
her
shelter
and
the
pillow
whereon
her
harassed
soul
might
repose
my
life
my
best
treasure
preserver
of
thy
wallace
look
on
him
exclaimed
he
bless
him
with
a
smile
from
those
dear
eyes
his
voice
his
caresses
soon
restored
her
to
sensibility
and
recollection
she
wept
on
his
breast
and
with
love
own
eloquence
thanked
heaven
that
he
had
escaped
the
search
and
the
arrows
of
his
enemies
but
my
dear
lady
interrupted
halbert
remember
my
master
must
not
stay
here
you
know
the
english
commander
said
he
must
fly
far
away
nay
spies
may
even
now
be
lurking
to
betray
him
you
are
right
cried
she
my
wallace
you
must
depart
should
the
guard
arrive
soon
your
flight
may
be
prevented
you
must
go
now
but
oh
whither
not
far
distant
my
love
in
going
from
thee
i
leave
behind
all
that
makes
my
life
precious
to
me
how
then
can
i
go
far
away
no
there
are
recesses
among
the
cartlane
craigs
i
discovered
while
hunting
and
which
i
believe
have
been
visited
by
no
mortal
foot
but
my
own
there
i
will
be
my
marion
before
sunrise
and
before
it
sets
thither
you
must
send
halbert
to
tell
me
how
you
fare
three
notes
from
thine
own
sweet
strains
of
thusa
ha
measg
na
reultan
mor
blown
by
his
pipe
shall
be
a
sign
to
me
that
he
is
there
and
i
will
come
forth
to
hear
tidings
of
thee
ha
measg
na
reultan
mor
are
the
beginning
words
of
an
old
gaelic
ditty
the
english
of
which
runs
thus
thou
who
art
amid
the
stars
move
to
thy
bed
with
music
ah
my
wallace
let
me
go
with
thee
what
dearest
returned
he
to
live
amidst
rocks
and
streams
to
expose
thy
tender
self
and
thine
unborn
infant
to
all
the
accidents
of
such
a
lodging
but
are
not
you
going
to
so
rough
so
dangerous
a
lodging
asked
she
o
would
not
rocks
and
streams
be
heaven
paradise
to
me
when
blessed
by
the
presence
of
my
husband
ah
let
me
go
impossible
my
lady
cried
halbert
afraid
that
the
melting
heart
of
his
master
would
consent
you
are
safe
here
and
your
flight
would
awaken
suspicion
in
the
english
that
he
had
not
gone
far
your
ease
and
safety
are
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
life
and
most
likely
by
his
care
to
preserve
them
he
would
be
traced
and
so
fall
a
ready
sacrifice
to
the
enemy
it
is
true
my
marion
i
could
not
preserve
you
in
the
places
to
which
i
go
but
the
hardships
you
will
endure
cried
she
to
sleep
on
the
cold
stones
with
no
covering
but
the
sky
or
the
dripping
vault
of
some
dreary
cave
i
have
not
courage
to
abandon
you
alone
to
such
cruel
rigors
cease
my
beloved
interrupted
he
cease
these
groundless
alarms
neither
rocks
nor
storms
have
any
threats
to
me
it
is
only
tender
woman
cares
that
make
man
body
delicate
before
i
was
thine
my
marion
i
have
lain
whole
nights
upon
the
mountain
brow
counting
the
wintery
stars
as
i
impatiently
awaited
the
hunter
horn
that
was
to
recall
me
to
the
chase
in
glenfinlass
alike
to
wallace
is
the
couch
of
down
or
the
bed
of
heather
so
of
my
heart
grieve
not
at
hardships
which
were
once
my
sport
and
will
now
be
my
safety
then
farewell
may
good
angels
guard
thee
her
voice
failed
she
put
his
hand
to
her
lips
courage
my
marion
said
he
remember
that
wallace
lives
but
in
thee
revive
be
happy
for
my
sake
and
god
who
putteth
down
the
oppressor
will
restore
me
to
thine
arms
she
spoke
not
but
rising
from
his
breast
clasped
her
hands
together
and
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
fervent
prayer
then
smiling
through
a
shower
of
tears
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
to
depart
and
instantly
disappeared
into
her
own
chamber
wallace
gazed
at
the
closed
door
with
his
soul
in
his
eyes
to
leave
his
marion
thus
to
quit
her
who
was
the
best
part
of
his
being
who
seemed
the
very
spring
of
the
life
now
throbbing
in
his
heart
was
a
contention
with
his
fond
fond
love
almost
too
powerful
for
his
resolution
here
indeed
his
brave
spirit
gave
way
and
he
would
have
followed
her
and
perhaps
have
determined
to
await
his
face
at
her
side
had
not
halbert
reading
his
mind
in
his
countenance
taken
him
by
the
arm
and
drawn
him
toward
the
portal
wallace
soon
recovered
his
better
reason
and
obeying
the
friendly
impulse
of
his
servant
accompanied
him
through
the
garden
to
the
quarter
which
pointed
toward
the
heights
that
led
to
the
remotest
recesses
of
the
clyde
in
their
way
they
approached
the
well
where
lord
mar
lay
finding
that
the
earl
had
not
been
inquired
for
wallace
deemed
his
stay
to
be
without
peril
and
intending
to
inform
him
of
the
necessity
which
still
impelled
his
own
flight
he
called
to
him
but
no
voice
answered
he
looked
down
and
seeing
him
extended
on
the

said
he
the
earl
is
dead
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
and
you
can
collect
the
dispersed
servants
send
one
into
the
well
to
bring
him
forth
and
if
he
be
indeed
no
more
deposit
his
body
in
my
oratory
till
you
can
receive
his
widow
commands
respecting
his
remains
the
iron
box
now
in
the
well
is
of
inestimable
value
take
it
to
lady
wallace
and
tell
her
she
must
guard
it
as
she
has
done
my
life
but
not
to
look
into
it
at
the
peril
of
what
is
yet
dearer
to
her
my
honor
halbert
promised
to
adhere
to
his
master
orders
and
wallace
girding
on
his
sword
and
taking
his
with
which
the
care
of
his
venerable
domestic
had
provided
him
he
pressed
the
faithful
hand
that
presented
it
and
again
enjoining
him
to
be
watchful
of
the
tranquillity
of
his
lady
and
to
send
him
tidings
of
her
in
the
evening
to
the
cave
near
the
corie
lynn
he
climbed
the
wall
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
chapter
iii
ellerslie
halbert
returned
to
the
house
and
entering
the
room
softly
into
which
marion
had
withdrawn
beheld
her
on
her
knees
before
a
crucifix
she
was
praying
for
the
safety
of
her
husband
may
he
o
gracious
lord
cried
she
soon
return
to
his
home
but
if
i
am
to
see
him
here
no
more
oh
may
it
please
thee
to
grant
me
to
meet
him
within
thy
arms
in
heaven
hear
her
blessed
son
of
mary
ejaculated
the
old
man
she
looked
round
and
rising
from
her
knees
demanded
of
him
in
a
kind
but
anxious
voice
whether
he
had
left
her
lord
in
security
in
the
way
to
it
my
lady
answered
halbert
he
repeated
all
that
wallace
had
said
at
parting
and
then
tried
to
prevail
on
her
to
go
to
rest
sleep
can
not
visit
my
eyes
this
night
my
faithful
creature
replied
she
my
spirit
will
follow
wallace
in
his
mountain
flight
go
you
to
your
chamber
after
you
have
had
repose
that
will
be
time
enough
to
revisit
the
remains
of
the
poor
earl
and
to
bring
them
with
the
box
to
the
house
i
will
take
a
religious
charge
of
both
for
the
sake
of
the
dear
intruster
halbert
persuaded
his
aldy
to
lie
down
on
the
bed
that
her
limbs
at
least
might
rest
after
the
fatigue
of
so
harassing
a
night
and
she
little
suspecting
that
he
meant
to
do
otherwise
than
to
sleep
also
kindly
wished
him
repose
and
retired
her
maids
during
the
late
terror
had
dispersed
and
were
nowhere
to
be
found
and
the
men
too
after
their
stout
resistance
at
the
gates
had
all
disappeared
some
fled
others
were
sent
away
prisoners
to
lanark
while
the
good
hambledon
was
conversing
with
their
lady
halbert
therefore
resigned
himself
to
await
with
patience
the
rising
of
the
sun
when
he
hoped
some
of
the
scared
domestics
would
return
if
not
he
determined
to
go
to
the
cotters
who
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
glen
and
bring
some
of
them
to
supply
the
place
of
the
fugitives
and
a
few
with
stouter
hearts
to
guard
his
lady
thus
musing
he
sat
on
a
stone
bench
in
the
hall
watching
anxiously
the
appearance
of
that
orb
whose
setting
beams
he
hoped
would
light
him
back
with
tidings
of
william
wallace
to
comfort
the
lonely
heart
of
his
marion
all
seemed
at
peace
nothing
was
hear
but
the
sighing
of
the
trees
as
they
waved
before
the
western
window
which
opened
toward
the
lanark
hills
the
morning
was
yet
gray
and
the
fresh
air
blowing
in
rather
chilly
halbert
rose
to
close
the
wooden
shutter
at
that
moment
his
eyes
were
arrested
by
a
party
of
armed
men
in
quick
march
down
the
opposite
declivity
in
a
few
minutes
more
their
heavy
steps
sounded
in
his
ears
and
he
saw
the
platform
before
the
house
filled
with
english
alarmed
at
the
sight
he
was
retreating
across
the
apartment
toward
his
lady
room
when
the
great
hall
door
was
burst
open
by
a
band
of
soldiers
who
rushed
forward
and
seized
him
tell
me
dotard
cried
their
leader
a
man
of
low
stature
with
gray
locks
but
a
fierce
countenance
where
is
the
murderer
where
is
sir
william
wallace
speak
or
the
torture
shall
force
you
halbert
shuddered
but
it
was
for
his
defenseless
lady
not
for
himself
my
master
said
he
is
far
from
this
where
i
know
not
thou
shalt
be
made
to
know
thou
villian
cried
the
same
violent
interrogator
where
is
the
assassin
wife
i
will
confront
ye
seek
her
out
at
that
word
the
soldiers
parted
right
and
left
and
in
a
moment
afterward
three
of
them
appeared
with
shouts
bringing
in
the
trembling
marion
alas
my
lady
cried
halbert
struggling
to
approach
her
as
with
terrified
apprehension
she
looked
around
her
but
they
held
her
fast
and
he
saw
her
led
up
to
the
merciless
wretch
who
had
given
the
orders
to
have
her
summoned
woman
cried
he
i
am
the
governor
of
lanark
you
now
stand
before
the
representative
of
the
great
king
edward
and
on
your
allegiance
to
him
and
on
the
peril
of
your
life
i
command
you
to
answer
me
three
questions
where
is
sir
william
wallace
the
murderer
of
my
nephew
who
is
that
old
scot
for
whom
my
nephew
was
slain
he
and
his
whole
family
shall
meet
my
vengeance
and
tell
me
where
is
that
box
of
treasure
which
your
husband
stole
from
douglas
castle
answer
me
these
questions
on
your
life
lady
wallace
remained
silent
speak
woman
demanded
the
governor
if
fear
can
not
move
you
know
that
i
can
reward
as
well
as
avenge
i
will
endow
you
richly
if
you
declare
the
truth
if
you
persist
to
refuse
you
die
then
i
die
replied
she
scarcely
opening
her
eyes
as
she
leaned
fainting
and
motionless
against
the
soldier
who
held
her
what
cried
the
governor
stifling
his
rage
in
hopes
to
gain
by
persuasion
on
a
spirit
he
found
threats
could
not
intimidate
can
so
gentle
a
lady
reject
the
favor
of
england
large
grants
in
this
country
and
perhaps
a
fine
english
knight
for
a
husband
when
you
might
have
all
for
the
trifling
service
of
giving
up
a
traitor
to
his
liege
lord
and
confessing
where
his
robberies
lie
concealed
speak
fair
dame
give
me
this
information
and
the
lands
of
the
wounded
chieftain
whom
wallace
brought
here
with
the
hand
of
the
handsome
sir
gilbert
hambledon
shall
be
your
reward
rich
and
a
beauty
in
edward
court
lady
can
you
now
refuse
to
purchase
all
by
declaring
the
hiding
place
of
the
traitor
wallace
it
is
easier
to
die
fool
cried
heselrigge
driven
from
his
assumed
temper
by
her
steady
denial
what
is
it
easier
for
these
dainty
limbs
to
be
hacked
to
pieces
by
my
soldiers
axes
is
it
easier
for
that
fair
bosom
to
be
trodden
underfoot
by
my
horse
hoofs
and
for
that
beauteous
head
of
thine
to
decorate
my
lance
is
all
this
easier
than
to
tell
me
where
to
find
a
murderer
and
his
gold
lady
wallace
shuddered
she
stretched
her
hands
to
heaven
speak
once
for
all
cried
the
enraged
governor
drawing
his
sword
i
am
no
hambledon
to
be
cajoled
by
your
beauty
declare
where
wallace
is
concealed
or
dread
my
vengeance
the
horrid
steel
gleamed
across
the
eyes
of
the
unhappy
marion
unable
to
sustain
herself
she
sunk
to
the
ground
kneel
not
to
me
for
mercy
cried
the
fierce
wretch
i
grant
none
unless
you
confess
your
husband
a
momentary
strength
darted
from
the
heart
of
lady
wallace
to
her
voice
i
kneel
to
heaven
alone
and
may
it
ever
preserve
my
wallace
from
the
fangs
of
edward
and
his
tyrants
blasphemous
wretch
cried
the
infuriated
heselrigge
and
in
that
moment
he
plunged
his
sword
into
her
defenseless
breast
halbert
who
had
all
this
time
been
held
back
by
the
soldiers
could
not
believe
that
the
fierce
governor
would
perpetrate
the
horrid
deed
he
threatened
but
seeing
it
done
with
a
giant
strength
and
a
terrible
cry
he
burst
from
the
hands
that
held
him
and
had
thrown
himself
on
the
bleeding
marion
before
her
murderer
could
strike
his
second
blow
however
it
fell
and
pierced
through
the
neck
of
the
faithful
servant
before
it
reached
her
heart
she
opened
her
dying
eyes
and
seeing
who
it
was
that
would
have
shielded
her
life
just
articulated
halbert
my
wallace
to
god
and
with
that
last
unfinished
sentence
her
pure
soul
took
its
flight
to
regions
of
eternal
piece
the
good
old
man
heart
almost
burst
when
he
felt
that
before
heaving
bosom
now
motionless
and
groaning
with
grief
and
fainting
with
loss
of
blood
he
lay
senseless
on
her
body
a
terrible
stillness
was
now
in
the
hall
not
a
man
spoke
all
stood
looking
on
each
other
with
a
stern
horror
marking
each
pale
countenance
heselrigge
dropping
his
sword
on
the
ground
perceived
by
the
behavior
of
his
men
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
fearful
of
arousing
the
indignation
of
awakened
humanity
to
some
act
against
himself
he
addressed
the
soldiers
in
an
unusual
accent
of
condescension
my
friends
said
he
we
will
now
return
to
lanark
you
may
come
back
for
i
reward
your
services
of
this
night
with
the
plunder
of
ellerslie
may
a
curse
light
on
him
who
carries
a
stick
from
its
grounds
exclaimed
a
veteran
from
the
further
end
of
the
hall
amen
murmured
all
the
soldiers
with
one
consent
and
falling
back
they
disappeared
one
by
one
out
of
the
great
door
leaving
heselrigge
alone
with
the
soldier
who
stood
leaning
on
his
sword
looking
on
the
murdered
lady
grimsby
why
stand
you
there
demanded
heselrigge
follow
me
never
returned
the
soldier
what
exclaimed
the
governor
momentarily
forgetting
his
panic
dare
you
speak
thus
to
your
commander
march
on
before
me
this
instant
or
expect
to
be
treated
as
a
rebel
i
march
at
your
command
no
more
replied
the
veteran
eying
him
resolutely
the
moment
you
perpetrated
this
bloody
deed
you
became
unworthy
the
name
of
man
and
i
should
disgrace
my
own
manhood
were
i
ever
again
to
obey
the
word
of
such
a
monster
villian
cried
the
enraged
heselrigge
you
shall
die
for
this
that
may
be
answered
grimsby
by
the
hands
of
some
tyrant
like
yourself
but
no
brave
man
not
the
royal
edward
would
do
otherwise
than
acquit
his
soldier
for
refusing
obedience
to
the
murderer
of
an
innocent
woman
it
was
not
so
he
treated
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
slaughtered
saracens
when
i
followed
his
banners
over
the
fields
of
palestine
thou
canting
miscreant
cried
heselrigge
springing
on
him
suddenly
and
aiming
his
dagger
at
his
breast
but
the
soldier
arrested
the
weapon
and
at
the
same
instant
closing
upon
the
assassin
with
a
turn
of
his
foot
threw
him
to
the
ground
heselrigge
as
he
lay
prostrate
seeing
his
dagger
in
his
adversary
hand
with
the
most
dastardly
promises
implored
for
life
monster
cried
the
soldier
i
wold
not
pollute
my
honest
hands
with
such
unnatural
blood
neither
though
thy
hand
has
been
lifted
against
my
life
would
i
willingly
take
thine
it
is
not
rebellion
against
my
commander
that
actuates
me
but
hatred
of
the
vilest
of
murderers
i
go
far
from
you
or
your
power
but
if
you
forswear
your
voluntary
oath
and
attempt
to
seek
me
out
for
vengeance
remember
it
is
a
soldier
of
the
cross
you
pursue
and
a
dire
retribution
shall
be
demanded
by
heaven
at
a
moment
you
can
not
avoid
and
with
a
horror
commensurate
with
your
crimes
there
was
a
solemnity
and
determination
in
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
soldier
that
paralyzed
the
intimidated
soul
of
the
governor
he
trembled
violently
and
repeating
the
oath
of
leaving
grimsby
unmolested
at
last
obtained
his
permission
to
return
to
lanark
the
men
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
their
commander
had
mounted
their
horses
and
were
now
far
out
of
sight
charger
was
still
in
the
courtyard
he
was
hurrying
toward
it
but
the
soldier
with
a
prudent
suspicion
called
out
stop
sir
you
must
walk
to
lanark
the
cruel
are
generally
false
i
can
not
trust
your
word
should
you
have
the
power
to
break
it
leave
this
horse
here
you
may
send
for
it
i
shall
then
be
far
away
heselrigge
saw
that
remonstrance
would
be
unavailing
and
shaking
with
impotent
rage
he
turned
into
the
path
which
after
five
weary
miles
would
lead
him
once
more
to
his
citadel
for
the
moment
the
soldier
manly
spirit
had
dared
to
deliver
its
abhorrence
of
lady
wallace
murder
he
was
aware
that
his
life
would
no
longer
be
safe
within
reach
of
the
machinations
of
heselrigge
and
determined
alike
by
detestation
of
him
and
regard
for
his
own
preservation
resolved
to
take
shelter
in
the
mountains
till
he
could
have
an
opportunity
of
going
beyond
sea
to
join
his
king
troops
in
the
guienne
wars
full
of
these
thoughts
he
returned
into
the
hall
as
he
approached
the
bleeding
form
on
the
floor
he
perceived
it
to
move
hoping
that
perhaps
the
unhappy
lady
might
not
be
dead
he
drew
near
but
alas
as
he
bent
to
examine
he
touched
her
hand
and
found
it
quite
cold
the
blood
which
had
streamed
from
the
now
exhausted
heart
lay
congealed
upon
her
arms
and
bosom
grimsby
shuddered
again
he
saw
her
move
but
it
was
not
with
her
own
life
the
recovering
senses
of
her
faithful
servant
as
his
arms
clung
around
the
body
had
disturbed
the
remains
of
her
who
would
wake
no
more
on
seeing
that
existence
yet
struggled
in
one
of
these
blameless
victims
grimsby
did
his
utmost
to
revive
the
old
man
he
raised
him
from
the
ground
and
poured
some
strong
liquor
he
had
in
a
flask
into
a
mouth
halbert
breathed
freer
and
his
kind
surgeon
with
the
venerable
harper
own
plaid
bound
up
the
wound
in
his
neck
halbert
opened
his
eyes
when
he
fixed
them
on
the
rough
features
and
english
helmet
of
the
soldier
he
closed
them
again
with
a
deep
groan
my
honest
scot
said
grimsby
trust
in
me
i
am
a
man
like
yourself
and
though
a
southron
am
no
enemy
to
age
and
helplessness
the
harper
took
courage
at
these
words
he
again
looked
at
the
soldier
but
suddenly
recollecting
what
had
passed
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
body
of
his
mistress
on
which
the
beams
of
the
now
rising
sun
were
shining
he
started
up
and
staggering
toward
her
would
have
fallen
had
not
grimsby
supported
him
o
what
a
sight
is
this
cried
he
wringing
his
hands
my
lady
my
lovely
lady
see
how
low
she
lies
who
was
once
the
delight
of
all
eyes
the
comforter
of
all
hearts
the
old
man
sobs
suffocated
him
the
veteran
turned
away
his
face
a
tear
dropped
upon
his
hand
accursed
heselrigge
ejaculated
he
thy
fate
must
come
if
there
be
a
man
heart
in
all
scotland
it
is
not
far
distant
cried
halbert
my
master
lives
and
will
avenge
this
murder
you
weep
soldier
and
you
will
not
betray
what
has
now
escaped
me
i
have
fought
in
palestine
returned
he
and
a
soldier
of
the
cross
betrays
none
who
trust
him
saint
mary
preserve
your
master
and
conduct
you
safely
to
him
we
must
both
hasten
hence
heselrigge
will
surely
send
in
pursuit
of
me
he
is
too
vile
to
forgive
the
truth
i
have
spoken
to
him
and
should
i
fall
into
his
power
death
is
the
best
i
could
expect
at
his
hands
let
me
assist
you
to
put
this
poor
remains
into
some
decent
place
and
then
my
honest
scot
we
must
separate
halbert
at
these
words
threw
himself
upon
the
bosom
of
his
mistress
and
wept
with
loud
lamentations
over
her
in
vain
he
attempted
to
raise
her
in
his
feeble
arms
i
have
carried
thee
scores
of
times
in
thy
blooming
infancy
cried
he
and
now
must
i
bear
thee
to
thy
grave
i
had
hoped
that
my
eyes
would
have
been
closed
by
this
dear
hand
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
her
cold
hand
to
his
lips
with
such
convulsive
sobs
that
the
soldier
fearing
he
would
expire
in
the
agony
of
his
sorrow
took
him
almost
motionless
from
the
dead
body
and
exhorted
him
to
suppress
such
grief
for
the
sake
of
his
master
halbert
gradually
revived
and
listening
to
him
cast
a
wistful
look
on
the
lifeless
marion
there
sleeps
the
pride
and
hope
of
ellerslie
the
mother
with
her
child
o
my
master
my
widowed
master
cried
he
what
will
comfort
thee
fearing
the
ill
consequence
of
further
delay
the
soldier
again
interrupted
his
lamentations
with
arguments
for
flight
and
halbert
recollecting
the
oratory
in
which
wallace
had
ordered
the
body
of
lord
mar
to
be
deposited
named
it
for
that
of
his
dear
lady
grimsby
immediately
wrapping
the
beauteous
corpse
in
the
white
garments
which
hung
about
it
raised
it
in
his
arms
and
was
conducted
by
halbert
to
a
little
chapel
in
the
heart
of
a
neighboring
cliff
the
still
weeping
old
man
removed
the
altar
and
grimsby
laying
the
shrouded
marion
upon
its
rocky
platform
covered
her
with
the
pall
which
he
drew
from
the
holy
table
and
laid
the
crucifix
upon
her
bosom
halbert
when
his
beloved
mistress
was
thus
hidden
from
his
sight
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
in
the
vehement
language
of
grief
offered
up
a
prayer
for
her
departed
soul
hear
me
righteous
judge
of
heaven
and
earth
cried
he
as
thou
didst
avenge
the
blood
of
innocence
shed
in
bethlehem
so
let
the
gray
hairs
of
heselrigge
be
brought
down
in
blood
to
the
grave
for
the
murder
of
this
innocent
lady
halbert
kissed
the
cross
and
rising
from
his
knees
went
weeping
out
of
the
chapel
followed
by
the
soldier
having
closed
the
door
and
carefully
locked
it
absorbed
in
meditation
on
what
would
be
the
agonized
transports
of
his
master
when
he
should
tell
him
these
grievous
tidings
halbert
proceeded
in
silence
till
he
and
his
companion
in
passing
the
well
were
startled
by
a
groan
here
is
some
one
in
extremity
cried
the
soldier
is
it
possible
he
lives
exclaimed
halbert
bending
down
to
the
edge
of
the
well
with
the
same
inquiry
yes
feebly
answered
the
earl
i
still
exist
but
am
very
faint
if
all
be
safe
above
i
pray
remove
me
into
the
upward
air
halbert
replied
that
it
was
indeed
necessary
he
should
ascend
immediately
and
lowering
the
rope
told
him
to
tie
the
iron
box
to
it
and
then
himself
this
done
with
some
difficulty
and
the
assistance
of
the
wondering
soldier
who
now
expected
to
see
the
husband
of
the
unfortunate
lady
wallace
emerge
to
the
knowledge
of
his
loss
he
at
last
effected
the
earl
release
for
a
few
seconds
the
fainting
nobleman
supported
himself
on
his
countryman
shoulder
while
the
fresh
morning
breeze
gradually
revived
his
exhausted
frame
the
soldier
looked
at
his
gray
locks
and
furrowed
brow
and
marveled
how
such
proofs
of
age
could
belong
to
the
man
whose
resistless
valor
had
discomfited
the
fierce
determination
of
arthus
heselrigge
and
his
myrmidons
however
his
doubts
of
the
veteran
before
him
being
other
than
the
brave
wallace
were
soon
satisfied
by
the
earl
himself
who
asked
for
a
draught
of
the
water
which
trickled
down
the
opposite
hill
and
while
halbert
went
to
bring
it
lord
mar
raised
his
eyes
to
inquire
for
sir
william
and
lady
marion
he
started
when
he
saw
english
armor
on
the
man
he
would
have
accosted
and
rising
suddenly
from
the
stone
on
which
he
sat
demanded
in
a
stern
voice
who
art
thou
an
englishman
answered
the
soldier
one
who
does
not
like
the
monster
heselrigge
disgrace
the
name
i
would
assist
you
noble
wallace
to
fly
this
spot
after
that
i
shall
seek
refuge
abroad
and
there
on
the
fields
of
guienne
demonstrate
my
fidelity
to
my
king
mar
looked
at
him
steadily
you
mistake
i
am
not
sir
william
wallace
at
that
moment
halbert
came
up
with
the
water
the
earl
drank
it
though
now
from
the
impulse
surprise
had
given
to
his
blood
he
did
not
require
its
efficacy
and
turning
to
the
venerable
bearer
he
asked
of
him
whether
his
master
were
safe
i
trust
he
is
replied
the
old
man
but
you
my
lord
must
hasten
hence
a
foul
murder
has
been
committed
here
since
you
left
it
but
where
is
lady
wallace
asked
the
earl
if
there
be
such
danger
we
must
not
leave
her
to
meet
it
she
will
never
meet
danger
more
cried
the
old
man
clasping
his
hand
she
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
virgin
and
no
second
steel
can
reach
her
there
what
exclaimed
the
earl
hardly
articulate
with
horror
is
lady
wallace
murdered
halbert
answered
only
by
his
tears
yes
said
the
soldier
and
detestation
of
so
unmanly
an
outrage
provoked
me
to
desert
his
standard
but
no
time
must
now
be
lost
in
unavailing
lamentation
heselrigge
will
return
and
if
we
also
would
not
be
sacrificed
to
his
rage
we
must
hence
immediately
the
earl
struck
dumb
at
this
recital
gave
the
soldier
time
to
recount
the
particulars
when
he
had
finished
lord
mar
saw
the
necessity
for
instant
flight
and
ordered
horses
to
be
brought
from
the
stables
though
he
had
fainted
in
the
well
the
present
shock
gave
such
tension
to
his
nerves
that
he
found
in
spite
of
his
wound
he
could
now
ride
without
difficulty
halbert
went
as
commanded
and
returned
with
two
horses
having
amongst
rocks
and
glens
to
go
he
did
not
bring
one
for
himself
and
begging
the
good
soldier
might
attend
the
earl
to
bothwell
he
added
he
will
guard
you
and
this
box
which
sir
william
wallace
holds
as
his
life
what
it
contains
i
know
not
and
none
he
says
may
dare
to
search
into
but
you
will
take
care
of
it
for
his
sake
till
more
peaceful
times
allow
him
to
reclaim
his
own
fatal
box
cried
the
soldier
regarding
it
with
an
abhorrent
eye
that
was
the
leading
cause
which
brought
heselrigge
to
ellerslie
how
inquired
the
earl
grimsby
then
briefly
related
that
immediately
after
the
return
to
lanark
of
the
detachment
sent
to
ellerslie
under
the
english
garrison
in
douglas
and
told
the
governor
that
sir
william
wallace
had
that
evening
taken
a
quantity
of
treasure
from
the
castle
his
report
was
that
the
english
soldiers
who
stood
near
the
scottish
knight
when
he
mounted
at
the
castle
gate
saw
a
long
iron
coffer
under
his
arm
but
not
suspecting
its
having
belonged
to
douglas
they
thought
not
of
it
till
they
overheard
sir
john
monteith
as
he
passed
through
one
of
the
galleries
muttering
something
about
gold
and
a
box
to
intercept
the
robber
amongst
his
native
glens
the
soldiers
deemed
impracticable
and
therefore
their
captain
came
immediately
to
lay
the
information
before
the
governor
of
lanark
as
the
scabbard
found
in
the
affray
with
young
arthur
had
betrayed
the
victor
to
have
been
sir
william
wallace
this
intimation
of
his
having
been
also
the
instrument
of
wrestling
from
the
grasp
of
heselrigge
perhaps
the
most
valuable
spoil
in
douglas
exasperated
him
to
the
most
vindictive
excess
inflamed
with
the
double
furies
of
revenge
and
avarice
he
ordered
out
a
new
troop
and
placing
himself
at
its
head
took
the
way
to
ellerslie
one
of
the
servants
whom
some
of
hambledon
men
had
seized
for
the
sake
of
information
on
being
threatened
with
the
torture
confessed
to
heselrigge
that
not
only
sir
william
wallace
was
in
the
house
when
it
was
attacked
but
that
the
person
whom
he
had
rescued
in
the
streets
of
lanark
and
who
proved
to
be
a
wealthy
nobleman
was
there
also
this
whetted
the
eagerness
of
the
governor
to
reach
ellerslie
and
expecting
to
get
a
rich
booty
without
the
most
distant
idea
of
the
horrors
he
was
going
to
perpetrate
a
large
detachment
of
men
followed
him
to
extort
money
from
you
my
lord
continued
the
soldier
and
to
obtain
that
fatal
coffer
were
his
main
objects
but
disappointed
in
his
darling
passion
of
avarice
he
forgot
he
was
a
man
and
the
blood
of
innocence
glutted
his
barbarous
vengeance
hateful
gold
cried
lord
mar
spurning
the
box
with
his
foot
it
can
not
be
for
itself
the
noble
wallace
so
greatly
prizes
it
it
must
be
a
trust
i
believe
it
is
returned
halbert
for
he
enjoined
my
lady
to
preserve
it
for
the
sake
of
his
honor
take
care
of
it
then
my
lord
for
the
same
sacred
reason
the
englishman
made
no
objection
to
accompany
the
earl
and
by
a
suggestion
of
his
own
halbert
brought
him
a
scottish
bonnet
and
cloak
from
the
house
while
he
put
them
on
the
earl
observed
that
the
harper
held
a
drawn
and
sword
in
his
hand
on
which
he
steadfastly
gazed
whence
came
that
forried
weapon
cried
lord
mar
it
is
my
lady
blood
replied
halbert
still
looking
on
it
i
found
it
where
she
lay
in
the
hall
and
i
will
carry
it
to
my
master
was
not
every
drop
of
her
blood
dear
to
him
and
here
are
many
as
the
old
man
spoke
he
bent
his
head
on
the
sword
and
groaned
heavily
england
shall
hear
more
of
this
cried
mar
as
he
threw
himself
across
the
horse
give
me
that
fatal
box
i
will
buckle
it
to
my
inadequate
will
be
my
utmost
care
of
it
to
repay
the
vast
sorrow
its
preservation
and
mine
have
brought
upon
the
head
of
my
deliverer
the
englishman
in
silence
mounted
his
horse
and
halbert
opened
a
that
led
to
the
hills
which
lay
between
ellerslie
and
bothwell
castle
lord
mar
took
a
bugle
from
his
breast
give
this
to
your
master
and
tell
him
that
by
whatever
hands
he
sends
it
the
sight
of
it
shall
always
command
the
services
of
donald
mar
i
go
to
bothwell
in
expectation
that
he
will
join
me
there
in
making
it
his
home
he
will
render
me
happy
for
my
friendship
is
now
bound
to
him
by
bonds
which
only
death
can
sever
halbert
took
the
horn
and
promising
faithfully
to
repeat
the
message
prayed
god
to
bless
him
and
the
honest
soldier
a
rocky
promontory
soon
excluded
them
from
his
sight
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
even
the
sound
of
their
horses
hoofs
was
lost
on
the
soft
herbage
of
the
winding
dell
now
i
am
alone
in
this
once
happy
spot
not
a
voice
not
a
sound
oh
wallace
cried
he
throwing
up
his
venerable
arms
thy
house
is
left
unto
thee
desolate
and
i
am
to
be
the
fatal
messenger
with
the
last
words
he
struck
into
a
deep
ravine
which
led
to
the
remotest
solitudes
of
the
glen
and
pursued
his
way
in
dreadful
silence
no
human
face
of
scot
or
english
cheered
or
scared
him
as
he
passed
along
the
tumult
had
so
alarmed
the
poor
cottagers
that
with
one
accord
they
fled
to
their
kindred
on
the
hills
amid
those
fastnesses
of
nature
to
await
tidings
from
the
valley
of
when
all
should
be
still
and
they
might
return
in
peace
halbert
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
no
smoke
curling
its
gray
mist
from
behind
the
intersecting
rocks
reminded
him
of
the
gladsome
morning
hour
or
invited
him
to
take
a
moment
rest
from
his
grievous
journey
all
was
lonely
and
comfortless
and
sighing
bitterly
over
the
wide
devastation
he
concealed
the
fatal
sword
and
the
horn
under
his
cloak
and
with
a
staff
which
he
broke
from
a
withered
tree
took
his
way
down
the
winding
craigs
many
a
pointed
flint
pierced
his
aged
feet
while
exploring
the
almost
trackless
paths
which
by
their
direction
he
hoped
would
lead
him
at
length
to
the
deep
caves
of
corie
lynn
chapter
iv
corie
lynn
after
having
traversed
many
a
weary
rood
of
to
him
before
untrodden
ground
the
venerable
minstrel
of
the
house
of
wallace
exhausted
by
fatigue
sat
down
on
the
declivity
of
a
steep
craig
the
burning
beams
of
the
midday
sun
now
beat
upon
the
rocks
but
the
overshadowing
foliage
afforded
him
shelter
and
a
few
berries
from
the
brambles
which
knit
themselves
over
the
path
he
had
yet
to
explore
with
a
draught
of
water
from
a
friendly
burn
offered
themselves
to
revive
his
enfeebled
limbs
insufficient
as
they
appeared
he
took
them
blessing
heaven
for
sending
even
these
and
strengthened
by
half
an
hour
rest
again
he
grasped
his
staff
to
pursue
his
way
after
breaking
a
passage
through
the
entangled
shrubs
that
grew
across
the
only
possible
footing
in
this
solitary
wilderness
he
went
along
the
side
of
the
expanding
stream
which
at
every
turning
of
the
rocks
increased
in
depth
and
violence
the
rills
from
above
and
other
mountain
brooks
pouring
from
abrupt
falls
down
the
craigs
covered
him
with
spray
and
intercepted
his
passage
finding
it
impracticable
to
proceed
through
the
rushing
torrent
of
a
cataract
whose
distant
roarings
might
have
intimidated
even
a
younger
adventurer
he
turned
from
its
tumbling
waters
which
burst
upon
his
sight
and
crept
on
his
hands
and
knees
up
the
opposite
acclivity
catching
by
the
fern
and
other
weeds
to
stay
him
from
falling
back
into
the
flood
below
prodigious
craggy
heights
towered
above
his
head
as
he
ascended
while
the
rolling
clouds
which
canopied
their
summits
seemed
descending
to
wrap
him
in
their
fleecy
skirts
or
the
projecting
rocks
bending
over
the
waters
of
the
glen
left
him
only
a
narrow
shelf
in
the
cliff
along
which
he
crept
till
it
brought
him
to
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
he
must
either
enter
it
or
return
the
way
he
came
or
attempt
the
descent
of
overhanging
precipices
which
nothing
could
surmount
but
the
pinions
of
their
native
birds
above
him
was
the
mountain
retread
his
footsteps
until
he
had
seen
his
beloved
master
he
was
resolved
not
to
do
to
perish
in
these
glens
would
be
more
tolerable
to
him
for
while
he
moved
forward
hope
even
in
the
arms
of
death
would
cheer
him
with
the
whisper
that
he
was
in
the
path
of
duty
he
therefore
entered
the
cavity
and
passing
on
soon
perceived
an
aperture
through
which
emerging
on
the
other
side
he
found
himself
again
on
the
margin
of
the
river
having
attained
a
wider
bed
it
left
him
a
still
narrower
causeway
to
perform
the
remainder
of
his
journey
huge
masses
of
rock
canopied
with
a
thick
umbrage
of
firs
beech
and
closed
over
the
glen
and
almost
excluded
the
light
of
day
but
more
anxious
as
he
calculated
by
the
increased
rapidity
of
the
stream
he
must
now
be
approaching
the
great
fall
near
his
concealment
halbert
redoubled
his
speed
but
an
obstacle
baffled
his
progress
a
growing
gloom
he
had
not
observed
in
the
sky
excluded
valley
having
entirely
overspread
the
heavens
at
this
moment
suddenly
discharged
itself
amidst
peals
of
thunder
in
heavy
floods
of
rain
upon
his
head
fearful
of
being
overwhelmed
by
the
streams
which
now
on
all
sides
crossed
his
path
he
kept
upon
the
edge
of
the
river
to
be
as
far
as
possible
from
the
influence
of
their
violence
and
thus
he
proceeded
slowly
and
with
trepidation
through
numerous
defiles
and
under
the
plunge
of
many
a
till
the
augmented
storm
of
a
world
of
waters
dashing
from
side
to
side
and
boiling
up
with
the
noise
and
fury
of
the
contending
elements
above
told
him
he
was
indeed
not
far
from
the
fall
of
corie
lynn
the
spray
was
spread
in
so
thick
a
mist
over
the
glen
he
knew
not
how
to
advance
a
step
further
might
be
on
the
firm
earth
but
more
probably
illusive
and
dash
him
into
the
roaring
lynn
where
he
would
be
ingulfed
at
once
in
its
furious
whirlpool
he
paused
and
looked
around
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
thunder
still
rolled
at
a
distance
and
echoed
tremendously
from
the
surrounding
rocks
halbert
shook
his
gray
locks
streaming
with
wet
and
looked
toward
the
sun
now
gliding
with
its
last
rays
the
vast
sheets
of
falling
water
this
is
thine
hour
my
master
exclaimed
the
old
man
and
surely
i
am
too
near
the
lynn
to
be
far
from
thee
with
these
words
he
raised
the
pipe
that
hung
at
his
breast
and
blew
three
strains
of
the
appointed
air
in
former
days
it
used
to
call
from
her
bower
that
fair
star
of
evening
the
beauteous
marion
now
departed
for
ever
into
her
native
heaven
the
notes
trembled
as
his
agitated
breath
breathed
them
into
the
instrument
but
feeble
as
they
were
and
though
the
roar
of
the
cataract
might
have
prevented
their
reaching
a
less
attentive
era
than
that
of
wallace
yet
he
sprung
from
the
innermost
recess
under
the
fall
and
dashing
through
its
rushing
waters
the
next
instant
was
at
the
side
of
halbert
faithful
creature
cried
he
catching
him
in
his
arms
which
all
the
joy
of
that
moment
which
ends
the
anxious
wish
to
learn
tidings
of
what
is
dearest
in
the
world
how
fares
my
marion
i
am
weary
cried
the
old
man
take
me
within
your
sanctuary
and
i
will
tell
you
all
wallace
perceived
that
his
servant
was
indeed
exhausted
and
knowing
the
toils
and
hazards
of
the
perilous
track
he
must
have
passed
over
in
his
way
to
his
fearful
solitude
also
remembering
how
as
he
sat
in
his
shelter
he
had
himself
dreaded
the
effects
of
the
storm
upon
so
aged
a
traveler
he
no
longer
wondered
at
the
dispirited
tone
of
his
greeting
and
readily
accounted
for
the
pale
countenance
and
tremulous
step
which
at
first
had
excited
his
alarm
giving
the
old
man
his
hand
he
led
him
with
caution
to
the
brink
of
the
lynn
and
then
folding
him
in
his
arms
dashed
with
him
through
the
tumbling
water
into
the
cavern
he
had
chosen
for
his
asylum
halbert
sunk
against
the
rocky
side
and
putting
forth
his
hand
to
catch
some
of
the
water
as
it
fell
drew
a
few
drops
to
his
parched
lips
and
swallowed
them
after
this
light
refreshment
he
breathed
a
little
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
anxious
master
are
you
sufficiently
recovered
halbert
to
tell
me
how
you
left
my
dearest
marion
halbert
dreaded
to
see
the
animated
light
which
now
cheered
him
from
the
eyes
of
his
master
overclouded
with
the
cimmerian
horrors
his
story
must
unfold
he
evaded
a
direct
reply
i
saw
your
guest
in
safety
i
saw
him
and
the
iron
box
on
their
way
to
bothwell
what
inquired
wallace
were
we
mistaken
was
not
the
earl
dead
when
we
looked
into
the
well
halbert
replied
in
the
negative
and
was
proceeding
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
his
recovery
and
his
departure
when
wallace
interrupted
him
but
what
of
my
wife
halbert
why
tell
me
of
others
before
of
her
she
whose
safety
and
remembrance
are
now
my
sole
comfort
oh
my
dear
lord
cried
halbert
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
in
a
paroxysm
of
mental
agony
she
remembers
you
where
best
her
prayers
can
be
heard
she
kneels
for
her
beloved
wallace
before
the
throne
of
god
halbert
cried
sir
william
in
a
low
and
fearful
voice
what
would
you
say
my
marion
speak
tell
me
in
one
word
she
lives
in
heaven
at
this
confirmation
of
a
sudden
terror
imbibed
from
the
ambiguous
words
of
halbert
and
which
his
fond
heart
would
not
allow
him
to
acknowledge
to
himself
wallace
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
fell
with
a
deep
groan
against
the
side
of
the
cavern
the
horrid
idea
of
premature
maternal
pains
occasioned
by
anguish
for
him
of
her
consequent
death
involving
perhaps
that
of
her
infant
struck
him
to
the
soul
a
mist
seemed
passing
over
his
eyes
life
was
receding
and
gladly
did
he
believe
he
felt
his
spirit
on
the
eve
of
joining
hers
in
having
declared
that
the
idol
of
his
master
heart
no
longer
existed
for
him
in
this
world
halbert
thought
he
had
revealed
the
worst
and
he
went
on
her
latest
breath
was
sent
in
prayer
for
you
wallace
were
the
last
words
her
angel
spirit
uttered
as
it
issued
from
her
bleeding
wounds
the
cry
that
burst
from
the
heart
of
wallace
as
he
started
on
his
feet
at
this
horrible
disclosure
seemed
to
pierce
through
all
the
recessed
of
the
glen
and
with
an
instantaneous
and
dismal
return
was
from
rock
to
rock
halbert
threw
his
arms
round
his
master
knees
the
frantic
blaze
of
his
eyes
struck
him
with
affright
hear
me
my
lord
for
the
sake
of
your
wife
now
an
angel
hovering
near
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
wallace
looked
around
with
a
wild
countenance
my
marion
near
me
blessed
spirit
oh
my
murdered
wife
my
unborn
babe
who
made
those
wounds
cried
he
catching
halbert
arm
with
a
tremendous
though
unconscious
grasp
tell
me
who
had
the
heart
to
aim
a
blow
at
that
angel
life
the
governor
of
lanark
replied
halbert
how
for
what
demanded
wallace
with
the
terrific
glare
of
madness
shooting
from
his
eyes
my
wife
my
wife
what
had
she
done
he
came
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
ruffians
and
seizing
my
lady
commanded
her
on
the
peril
of
her
life
to
declare
where
you
and
the
earl
of
mar
and
the
box
of
treasure
were
concealed
my
lady
persisted
in
refusing
him
information
and
in
a
deadly
rage
he
plunged
his
sword
into
her
breast
wallace
clinched
his
hands
over
his
face
and
halbert
went
on
before
he
aimed
a
second
blow
i
had
broken
from
the
men
who
held
me
and
thrown
myself
on
her
bosom
but
all
could
not
save
her
the
villain
sword
had
penetrated
her
heart
great
god
exclaimed
wallace
dost
thou
hear
this
murder
his
hands
were
stretched
toward
heaven
then
falling
on
his
knees
with
his
eyes
fixed
give
me
power
almighty
judge
cried
he
to
assert
thy
justice
let
me
avenge
this
angel
blood
and
then
take
me
to
thy
mercy
my
gracious
master
cried
halbert
seeing
him
rise
with
a
stern
composure
here
is
the
fatal
sword
the
blood
on
it
is
sacred
and
i
brought
it
to
you
wallace
took
it
in
his
hand
he
gazed
at
it
touched
it
and
kissed
it
frantically
the
blade
was
scarcely
yet
dry
and
the
ensanguined
hue
came
off
upon
the
pressure
marion
marion
cried
he
is
it
thine
does
not
thy
blood
stain
my
lip
he
paused
for
a
moment
leaning
his
burning
forehead
against
the
fatal
blade
then
looking
up
with
a
terrific
smile
beloved
of
my
soul
never
shall
this
sword
leave
my
hand
till
it
has
drunk
the
of
thy
murderer
what
is
it
you
intend
my
lord
cried
halbert
viewing
with
increased
alarm
the
resolute
ferocity
which
now
blazing
from
every
part
of
his
countenance
seemed
to
dilate
his
figure
with
more
than
mortal
daring
what
can
you
do
your
single
i
am
not
is
with
me
i
am
his
avenger
now
tremble
tyranny
i
come
to
hurl
thee
down
at
the
word
he
sprung
from
the
cavern
mouth
and
had
already
reached
the
topmost
cliff
when
the
piteous
cries
of
halbert
penetrated
his
ear
they
recalled
him
to
recollection
and
returning
to
his
servant
he
tried
to
soothe
his
fear
and
spoke
in
a
composed
though
determined
tone
i
will
lead
you
from
this
solitude
to
the
mountains
where
the
shepherds
of
ellerslie
are
tending
their
flocks
with
them
you
will
find
a
refuge
till
you
have
strength
to
reach
bothwell
castle
lord
mar
will
protect
you
for
my
sake
halbert
now
remembered
the
bugle
and
putting
it
into
the
hand
with
its
accompanying
message
asked
for
some
testimony
in
return
that
the
earl
might
know
that
he
had
delivered
it
safely
even
a
lock
of
your
precious
hair
my
beloved
master
will
be
sufficient
thou
shalt
have
it
severed
from
my
head
by
this
accurse
steel
answered
wallace
taking
off
his
bonnet
and
letting
his
amber
locks
fall
in
tresses
on
his
shoulders
halbert
burst
into
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
for
he
remembered
how
often
it
had
been
the
delight
of
marion
to
comb
these
bright
tresses
and
to
twist
them
round
he
ivory
fingers
wallace
looked
up
as
the
old
man
sobs
became
audible
and
read
his
thoughts
it
will
never
be
again
halbert
cried
he
and
with
a
firm
grasp
of
the
sword
he
cut
off
a
large
handful
of
his
hair
marion
thy
blood
hath
marked
it
exclaimed
he
and
every
hair
on
my
head
shall
be
dyed
of
the
same
hue
before
this
sword
is
sheathed
upon
thy
murderers
here
halbert
continued
he
knotting
it
together
take
this
to
the
earl
of
mar
it
is
all
most
likely
he
will
ever
see
again
of
william
wallace
should
i
fall
tell
him
to
look
on
that
and
in
my
wrongs
read
the
future
miseries
of
scotland
and
remember
that
god
armoreth
the
patriot
hand
let
him
set
on
that
conviction
and
scotland
may
yet
be
free
halbert
placed
the
lock
in
his
bosom
but
again
repeated
his
entreaties
that
his
master
would
accompany
him
to
bothwell
castle
he
urged
the
consolation
he
would
meet
from
the
good
earl
friendship
if
he
indeed
regard
me
returned
wallace
for
my
sake
let
him
cherish
you
my
consolations
must
come
from
a
higher
hand
i
go
where
it
directs
if
i
live
you
shall
see
me
again
but
twilight
approaches
we
must
away
the
sun
must
not
rise
again
upon
heselrigge
halbert
now
followed
the
rapid
steps
of
wallace
who
assisting
the
feeble
limbs
of
his
faithful
servant
drew
him
up
the
precipitous
side
of
the
lynn
and
then
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
awaited
with
impatience
the
slower
advances
of
the
poor
old
harper
as
he
crept
round
a
circuit
of
overhanging
cliffs
to
join
him
on
the
summit
of
the
craigs
cavern
which
sheltered
sir
william
wallace
near
corie
lynn
is
yet
revered
by
the
people
together
they
struck
into
the
most
inaccessible
defiles
of
the
mountains
and
proceeded
till
on
discerning
smoke
whitening
with
its
ascending
curls
the
black
sides
of
the
impending
rocks
wallace
saw
himself
near
the
objects
of
his
search
he
sprung
on
a
high
cliff
projecting
over
this
and
blowing
his
bugle
with
a
few
notes
of
the
pibroch
of
lanarkshire
was
answered
by
the
reverberations
of
a
thousand
echoes
at
the
loved
sounds
which
had
not
dared
to
visit
their
ears
since
the
scottish
standard
was
lowered
to
edward
the
hills
seemed
teeming
with
life
men
rushed
from
their
fastnesses
and
women
with
their
babes
eagerly
followed
to
see
whence
sprung
a
summons
so
dear
to
every
scottish
heart
wallace
stood
on
the
cliff
like
the
genius
of
his
country
his
long
plaid
floated
afar
and
his
glittering
hair
streaming
on
the
blast
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
golden
fires
which
shot
from
the
heavens
wallace
raised
his
eyes
a
clash
as
of
the
tumult
of
contending
armies
filled
the
sky
and
flames
and
flashing
steel
and
the
horrid
red
of
battle
streamed
from
the
clouds
upon
the
hills
late
duke
of
gordon
exhibited
a
similar
scene
to
prince
leopold
when
his
royal
highness
visited
gordon
castle
his
hills
reeming
with
scotsmen
cried
wallace
waving
the
fatal
sword
which
blazed
in
the
glare
of
these
northern
lights
like
a
flaming
brand
behold
how
the
heavens
cry
aloud
to
you
i
come
in
the
midst
of
their
fires
to
call
you
to
vengeance
i
come
in
the
name
of
all
ye
hold
dear
of
the
wives
of
you
bosoms
and
the
children
in
their
arms
to
tell
you
the
poniard

and

before
it
with
this
sword

the

tyrant
of

break
into
my
house
and
murder
my
wife
the
shriek
of
horror
that
burst
from
every
mouth
interrupted
wallace
vengeance
vengeance
was
the
cry
of
the
men
while
tumultuous
lamentations
for
the
sweet
lady
of
ellerslie
filled
the
air
from
the
women
wallace
sprung
from
the
cliff
into
the
midst
of
his
brave
countrymen
follow
me
then
to
strike
the
mortal
blow
lead
on
cried
a
vigorous
old
man
i
drew
this
stout
claymore
last
in
the
battle
of
largs
life
and
alexander
was
then
the
word

now

lady

the
battle
of

sir
malcolm
wallace
the
father
of
wallace
fell
gloriously
fighting
against
the
death
and
lady
marion
was
echoed
with
shouts
from
mouth
to
mouth
every
sword
was
drawn
and
those
hardy
peasants
who
owned
none
seizing
the
instruments
of
pasturage
armed
themselves
with
pickaxes
forks
and
scythes
sixty
resolute
men
now
ranged
themselves
around
their
chief
wallace
whose
widowed
heart
turned
icy
cold
at
the
dreadful
slogan
of
his
marion
name
more
fiercely
grasped
his
sword
and
murmured
to
himself
from
this
day
may
scotland
date
her
liberty
or
wallace
return
no
more
my
faithful
friends
cried
he
turning
to
his
men
and
placing
his
plumed
bonnet
on
his
head
let
the
spirits
of
your
fathers
inspire
you
souls
ye
go
to
assert
that
freedom
for
which
they
died
before
the
moon
sets
the
tyrant
of
lanark
must
fall
in
blood
death
and
lady
marion
was
the
pealing
answer
that
echoed
from
the
hills
wallace
again
sprung
on
the
cliffs
his
brave
peasants
followed
him
and
taking
their
rapid
march
by
a
near
cut
through
a
hitherto
unexplored
defile
of
the
cartlane
craigs
leaping
chasms
and
climbing
perpendicular
rocks
they
suffered
no

to
impede

prey
chapter
lanark
castle
the
women
and
the
men
who
age
withheld
from
so
desperate
an
enterprise
now
thronged
around
halbert
to
ask
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
disaster
which
had
filled
all
with
so
much
horror
many
tears
followed
his
recital
not
one
of
his
auditors
was
an
indifferent
listener
all
had
individually
or
in
persons
dear
to
them
partaken
of
the
tender
marion
benevolence
their
sick
beds
had
been
comforted
by
her
charity
her
voice
had
often
administered
consolation
to
their
sorrows
her
hand
had
smoothed
their
pillows
and
placed
the
crucifix
before
their
dying
eyes
some
had
recovered
to
bless
her
and
some
had
departed
to
record
her
virtues
in
heaven
ah
is
she
gone
cried
a
young
woman
raising
her
face
covered
with
tears
from
the
bosom
of
her
infant
is
the
loveliest
lady
that
ever
the
sun
shone
upon
cold
in
the
grave
alas
for
me
she
it
was
that
gave
me
the
roof
under
which
my
baby
was
born
she
it
was
who
when
the
southron
soldiers
slew
my
father
and
drove
us
from
our
home
in
ayrshire
gave
to
my
old
mother
and
my
then
wounded
husband
our
cottage
by
the
burnside
ah
well
can
i
spare
him
now
to
avenge
her
murder
the
night
being
far
advanced
halbert
retired
at
the
invitation
of
this
young
woman
to
repose
on
the
of
her
husband
who
was
now
absent
with
wallace
the
rest
of
the
peasantry
withdrew
to
their
coverts
while
she
and
some
other
women
whose
anxieties
would
not
allow
them
to
sleep
sat
at
the
cavern
mouth
watching
the
slowly
moving
hours
the
objects
of
their
fond
and
fervent
prayers
wallace
and
his
little
army
were
rapidly
pursuing
their
march
it
was
midnight
all
was
silent
as
they
hurried
through
the
glen
as
they
ascended
with
flying
footsteps
the
steep
acclivities
that
led
to
the
cliffs
which
overhung
the
vale
of
ellerslie
wallace
must
pass
along
their
brow
beneath
was
the
tomb
of
his
sacrificed
marion
he
rushed
forward
to
snatch
one
look
even
of
the
roof
which
shrouded
her
beloved
remains
but
in
the
moment
before
he
mounted
the
intervening
height
a
soldier
in
english
armor
crossed
the
path
and
was
seized
by
his
men
one
of
them
would
have
cut
him
down
but
wallace
turned
away
the
weapon
hold
scot
cried
he
you
are
not
a
southron
to
strike
the
defenseless
the
man
has
no
sword
the
reflection
on
their
enemy
which
this
plea
of
mercy
contained
reconciled
the
impetuous
scots
to
the
clemency
of
their
leader
the
rescued
man
joyfully
recognizing
the
voice
of
wallace
exclaimed
it
is
my
lord
it
is
sir
william
wallace
that
has
saved
my
life
a
second
time
who
are
you
asked
wallace
that
helmet
can
cover
no
friend
of
mine
i
am
your
servant
dugald
returned
the
man
he
whom
your
brave
arm
saved
from
the
of
arthur
heselrigge
i
can
not
ask
you
how
you
came
by
that
armor
but
if
you
be
yet
a
scot
throw
it
off
and
follow
me
not
to
ellerslie
my
lord
cried
he
it
has
been
plundered
and
burned
to
the
ground
by
the
governor
of
lanark
then
exclaimed
wallace
striking
his
breast
are
the
remains
of
my
beloved
marion
forever
ravished
from
my
eyes
insatiate
monster
he
is
scotland
curse
cried
the
veteran
of
largs
forward
my
lord
in
mercy
to
your
country
groans
wallace
had
now
mounted
the
craig
which
overlooked
ellerslie
his
once
happy
home
had
disappeared
and
all
beneath
lay
a
heap
of
smoking
ashes
he
hastened
from
the
sight
and
directing
the
point
of
his
sword
with
a
forceful
action
toward
lanark
with
supernatural
strength
forward
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
his
little
host
flew
over
the
hills
reached
the
cliffs
which
divided
them
from
the
town
and
leaped
down
before
the
outward
trench
of
the
castle
of
lanark
in
a
moment
wallace
sprung
so
feeble
a
barrier
and
with
a
shout
of
death
in
which
the
tremendous
slogan
of
his
men
now
joined
he
rushed
upon
the
guard
that
held
the
northern
gate
here
slept
the
governor
these
opponents
being
slain
by
the
first
sweep
of
the
scottish
swords
wallace
hastened
onward
winged
with
twofold
retribution
the
noise
of
battle
was
behind
him
for
the
shouts
of
his
men
had
aroused
the
garrison
and
drawn
its
soldiers
to
the
spot
he
reached
the
door
of
the
governor
the
sentinel
who
stood
there
flew
before
the
terrible
warrior
that
presented
himself
all
the
mighty
vengeance
of
wallace
blazed
in
his
face
and
seemed
to
surround
his
figure
with
a
terrible
splendor
with
one
stroke
of
his
foot
he
drove
the
door
from
its
hinges
and
rushed
into
the
room
what
a
sight
for
the
now
awakened
and
guilty
heselrigge
it
was
the
husband
of
the
defenseless
woman
he
had
murdered
come
in
the
power
of
justice
with
uplifted
arm
and
vengeance
in
his
eyes
with
a
terrific
scream
of
despair
and
an
outcry
for
the
mercy
he
dared
not
expect
he
fell
back
into
the
bed
and
sought
an
unavailing
shield
beneath
its
folds
marion
marion
cried
wallace
as
he
threw
himself
toward
the
bed
and
buried
the
sword
yet
red
with
her
blood
through
the
coverlid
deep
into
the
heart
of
her
murderer
a
yell
from
the
slain
heselrigge
told
him
his
work
was
done
and
drawing
out
the
sword
he
took
the
streaming
blade
in
his
hand
vengeance
is
satisfied
cried
he
thus
o
god
do
i
henceforth
divide
self
from
my
heart
as
he
spoke
he
snapped
the
sword
in
twain
and
throwing
away
the
pieces
put
back
with
his
hand
the
impending
weapons
of
his
brave
companions
who
having
cleared
the
passage
of
their
assailants
had
hurried
forward
to
assist
in
ridding
their
country
of
so
detestable
a
tyrant
tis
done
cried
he
as
he
spoke
he
drew
down
the
coverlid
and
discovered
the
body
of
the
governor
weltering
in
blood
the
ghastly
countenance
on
which
the
agonies
of
hell
seemed
imprinted
glared
horrible
even
in
death
wallace
turned
away
but
the
men
exulting
in
the
sight
with
a
shout
of
triumph
exclaimed
so
fall
the
enemies
of
sir
william
wallace
rather
to
fall
the
enemies
of
scotland
cried
he
from
this
hour
wallace
has
neither
love
nor
resentment
but
for
her
heaven
has
heard
me
devote
myself
to
work
our
country
freedom
or
to
die
who
will
follow
me
in
so
just
a
cause
all
wallace
forever
the
new
clamor
which
this
resolution
excited
intimidated
a
fresh
band
of
soldiers
who
were
hastening
across
the
courtyard
to
seek
the
enemy
in
the
governor
apartments
but
on
the
noise
they
hastily
retreated
and
no
exertions
of
their
officers
could
prevail
on
them
to
advance
again
or
even
to
appear
in
sight
when
the
resolute
scots
with
wallace
at
their
head
soon
afterward
issued
from
the
great
gate
the
english
commanders
seeing
the
panic
of
their
men
and
which
they
were
less
able
to
surmount
on
account
of
the
way
to
the
gate
being
strewn
with
their
slain
comrades
fell
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
towers
where
by
the
light
of
the
moon
like
men
paralyzed
they
viewed
the
departure
of
their
enemies
over
the
trenches
chapter
vi
cartlane
craigs
the
sun
was
rising
from
the
eastern
hills
when
the
victorious
group
the
where
their
families
lay
the
cheerful
sounds
of
their
bugles
aroused
the
sleepers
from
their
caves
and
many
were
the
gratulations
and
embraces
which
welcomed
the
warriors
to
affection
and
repose
wallace
while
he
threw
himself
along
a
bed
of
purple
heath
gathered
for
him
by
many
a
busy
female
hand
listened
with
a
calmed
mind
to
the
fond
inquiries
of
halbert
who
awakened
by
the
first
blast
of
the
horn
had
started
from
his
shelter
and
hastened
to
hail
the
safe
return
of
his
master
while
his
faithful
followers
retired
each
to
the
bosom
of
his
rejoicing
family
the
fugitive
chief
of
ellerslie
remained
alone
with
the
old
man
and
recounted
to
him
the
success
of
his
enterprise
and
the
double
injuries
he
had
avenged
the
assassin
continued
he
has
paid
with
his
life
for
his
inexpiable
crime
he
is
slain
and
with
him
several
of
edward
garrison
my
vengeance
may
be
appeased
but
what
o
halbert
can
bring
redress
to
my
widowed
heart
all
is
lost
to
me
i
have
now
nothing
to
do
with
this
world
but
as
i
may
be
the
instrument
of
good
to
others
the
scottish
sword
has
now
been
redrawn
against
our
foes
and
with
the
blessing
of
heaven
i
swear
it
shall
not
be
sheathed
till
scotland
be
rid
of
the
tyranny
which
has
slain
my
happiness
this
night
my
gallant
scots
have
sworn
to
accomplish
my
vow
and
death
or
liberty
must
be
the
future
fate
of
wallace
and
his
friends
at
these
words
tears
ran
down
the
cheeks
of
the
venerable
harper
alas
my
too
brave
master
exclaimed
he
what
is
it
you
would
do
why
rush
upon
certain
destruction
for
the
sake
of
her
memory
whom
you
deplore
in
pity
to
the
worthy
earl
of
mar
who
will
arraign
himself
as
the
cause
of
all
these
calamities
and
of
your
death
should
you
fall
retract
this
desperate
vow
no
my
good
halbert
returned
wallace
i
am
neither
desperate
nor
inefficient
and
you
faithful
creature
shall
have
no
cause
to
mourn
this
night
resolution
go
to
lord
mar
and
tell
him
what
are
my
resolves
i
have
nothing
now
that
binds
me
to
life
but
my
country
and
henceforth
she
shall
be
to
me
as
mistress
wife
and
child
would
you
deprive
me
of
this
tie
halbert
would
you
by
persuading
me
to
resign
my
interest
in
her
devote
me
to
a
hermit
seclusion
amongst
these
rocks
for
i
will
never
again
appear
in
the
tracks
of
men
if
it
be
not
as
the
defender
of
her
rights
but
where
my
master
shall
we
find
you
should
the
earl
choose
to
join
you
with
his
followers
in
this
wilderness
whence
i
shall
not
remove
rashly
my
purpose
is
to
save
my
countrymen
not
to
sacrifice
them
in
needless
dangers
halbert
oppressed
with
sorrow
at
the
images
his
foreboding
heart
drew
of
the
direful
scenes
in
which
his
beloved
master
had
pledged
himself
to
become
the
leader
bowed
his
head
with
submission
and
leaving
wallace
to
his
rest
retired
to
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
to
weep
alone
it
was
noon
before
the
chief
awoke
from
the
sleep
into
which
kind
nature
had
plunged
his
senses
he
opened
his
eyes
languidly
and
when
the
sight
of
his
rocky
apartment
forced
on
him
the
recollection
of
all
his
miseries
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
that
sad
sound
so
different
from
the
jocund
voice
with
which
wallace
used
to
issue
from
his
rest
struck
on
the
heart
of
halbert
he
drew
near
his
master
to
receive
his
last
commands
for
bothwell
on
my
knees
added
he
will
i
implore
the
earl
to
send
you
succor
he
needs
not
prayers
for
that
returned
wallace
but
depart
dear
worthy
halbert
it
will
comfort
me
to
know
you
are
in
safety
and
whithersoever
you
go
you
carry
my
thanks
and
blessings
with
you
old
age
opens
the
fountains
of
tears
halbert
flowed
profusely
and
bathed
his
master
hand
could
wallace
have
wept
it
would
have
been
then
but
that
gentle
emollient
of
grief
was
denied
to
him
and
with
a
voice
of
assumed
cheerfulness
he
renewed
his
efforts
to
encourage
his
desponding
servant
half
persuaded
that
a
superior
being
did
indeed
call
his
beloved
master
to
some
extraordinary
exertions
for
scotland
halbert
bade
him
an
anxious
farewell
and
then
withdrew
to
commit
him
to
the
fidelity
of
the
companions
of
his
destiny
a
few
of
them
led
the
old
man
on
his
way
as
far
as
the
western
declivity
of
the
hills
and
then
bidding
him
good
speed
he
took
the
remainder
of
his
journey
alone
after
traversing
many
a
weary
mile
between
cartlane
craigs
and
bothwell
castle
he
reached
the
valley
in
which
that
fortress
stands
and
calling
to
the
warder
at
his
gates
that
he
came
from
sir
william
wallace
was
immediately
admitted
and
conducted
into
the
castle
halbert
was
led
by
a
servant
into
a
spacious
chamber
where
the
earl
lay
on
a
couch
a
lady
richly
habited
and
in
the
bloom
of
life
sat
at
his
head
another
much
younger
and
of
resplendent
beauty
knelt
at
his
feet
with
a
salver
of
medicinal
cordials
in
her
hand
the
lady
marion
loveliness
had
been
that
of
a
soft
moonlight
evening
but
the
face
which
now
turned
upon
halbert
as
he
entered
was
full
of
light
and
splendor
and
joy
and
the
old
man
eyes
even
though
dimmed
in
tears
were
dazzled
a
young
man
stood
near
her
on
the
entrance
of
halbert
whom
the
earl
instantly
recognized
he
raised
himself
on
his
arm
and
welcomed
him
the
young
lady
rose
and
the
young
man
stepped
eagerly
forward
the
earl
inquired
anxiously
for
sir
william
wallace
and
asked
if
he
might
expect
him
soon
at
bothwell
he
can
not
yet
come
my
lord
replied
halbert
hard
is
the
task
he
has
laid
upon
his
valiant
head
but
he
is
avenged
he
has
slain
the
governor
of
lanark
a
faint
exclamation
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
young
lady
how
demanded
the
earl
halbert
now
gave
a
particular
account
of
the
anguish
of
wallace
when
he
was
told
of
the
sanguinary
events
which
had
taken
place
at
ellerslie
as
the
honest
harper
described
in
his
own
ardent
language
the
devoted
zeal
with
which
the
shepherds
on
the
heights
took
up
arms
to
avenge
the
wrong
done
to
their
chief
the
countenance
of
the
young
lady
and
of
the
youth
glowed
through
tears
they
looked
on
each
other
and
halbert
proceeded
when
my
dear
master
and
his
valiant
troop
were
pursuing
their
way
to
lanark
he
was
met
by
dugald
the
wounded
man
who
had
rushed
into
the
room
to
apprise
us
of
the
advance
of
the
english
forces
during
the
confusion
of
that
horrible
night
and
in
the
midst
of
the
contention
in
spite
of
his
feebleness
he
crept
away
and
concealed
himself
from
the
soldiers
amongst
the
bushes
of
the
glen
when
all
was
over
he
came
from
his
and
finding
the
english
soldier
helmet
and
cloak
poor
dugald
still
fearful
of
falling
in
with
any
straggling
party
of
heselrigge
disguised
himself
in
those
southron
clothes
exhausted
with
hunger
he
was
venturing
toward
the
house
in
search
of
food
when
the
sight
of
armed
men
in
the
hall
made
him
hastily
retreat
into
his
former
place
of
refuge
his
alarm
was
soon
increased
by
a
redoubled
noise
from
the
house
oaths
and
horrid
bursts
of
merriment
seemed
to
have
turned
that
once
abode
of
honor
and
of
loveliness
into
the
clamorous
haunts
of
ribaldry
and
rapine
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
he
was
surprised
by
seeing
flames
issue
from
the
windows
soldiers
poured
from
the
doors
with
shouts
of
triumph
some
carried
off
the
booty
and
others
watched
by
the
fire
till
the
interior
of
the
building
was
consumed
and
the
rest
sunk
a
heap
of
smoking
ruins
the
work
completed
these
horrid
ministers
of
devastation
left
the
vale
to
its
own
solitude
dugald
after
waiting
a
long
time
to
ascertain
they
were
quite
gone
crawled
from
the
bushes
and
ascending
the
cliffs
he
was
speeding
to
the
mountains
when
encountering
our
armed
shepherds
they
mistook
him
for
an
english
soldier
and
seized
him
the
chief
of
ruined
ellerslie
recognized
his
servant
and
with
redoubled
indignation
his
followers
heard
the
history
of
the
moldering
ashes
before
them
brave
persecuted
wallace
exclaimed
the
earl
how
dearly
was
my
life
purchased
but
proceed
halbert
tell
me
that
he
returned
safe
from
lanark
halbert
now
recounted
the
dreadful
scenes
which
took
place
in
that
town
and
that
when
the
governor
fell
wallace
made
a
vow
never
to
mingle
with
the
world
again
till
scotland
should
be
free
alas
cried
the
earl
what
miracle
is
to
effect
that
surely
he
will
not
bury
those
noble
qualities
that
prime
of
manhood
within
the
gloom
of
a
cloister
no
my
lord
he
has
retired
to
the
fastnesses
of
cartlane
craigs
why
resumed
mar
why
did
he
not
rather
fly
to
me
this
castle
is
strong
and
while
one
stone
of
it
remains
upon
another
not
all
the
hosts
of
england
should
take
him
hence
it
was
not
your
friendship
he
doubted
returned
the
old
man
love
for
his
country
compels
him
to
reject
all
comfort
in
which
she
does
not
share
his
last
words
to
me
were
these
have
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
assert
the
liberties
of
scotland
and
to
rid
her
of
her
enemies
go
to
lord
mar
take
this
lock
of
my
hair
stained
with
the
blood
of
my
wife
it
is
all
most
likely
he
will
ever
again
see
of
william
wallace
should
i
fall
tell
him
to
look
on
that
and
in
my
wrongs
read
the
future
miseries
of
scotland
and
remember
that
god
armeth
the
patriot
tears
dropped
so
fast
from
the
young
lady
eyes
she
was
obliged
to
walk
to
a
window
to
restrain
a
more
violent
burst
of
grief
o
my
uncle
cried
the
youth
surely
the
freedom
of
scotland
is
possible
i
feel
in
my
soul
that
the
words
of
the
brave
wallace
are
prophetic
the
earl
held
the
lock
of
hair
in
his
hands
he
regarded
it
lost
in
meditation
armeth
the
patriot
he
paused
again
his
before
pallid
cheek
taking
a
thousand
animated
hues
then
raising
the
sacred
present
to
his
lips
yes
cried
he
thy
vow
shall
be
performed
and
while
donald
mar
has
an
arm
to
wield
a
sword
or
a
man
to
follow
to
the
field
thou
shalt
command
both
him
and
them
but
not
as
you
are
my
lord
cried
the
elder
lady
your
wounds
are
yet
unhealed
your
fever
is
still
raging
would
it
not
be
madness
to
expose
your
safety
at
such
a
crisis
i
shall
not
take
arms
myself
answered
he
till
i
can
bear
them
to
effect
meanwhile
all
of
my
clan
and
of
my
friends
that
i
can
raise
to
guard
the
life
of
my
deliverer
and
to
promote
the
cause
must
be
summoned
this
lock
shall
be
my
pennon
and
what
scotsman
will
look
on
that
and
shrink
from
his
colors
here
helen
my
child
cried
he
addressing
the
young
lady
before
dawn
have
this
hair
wrought
into
my
banner
it
will
be
a
patriot
standard
and
let
his
own
irresistible
words
be
the
motto
god
armeth
me
helen
advanced
with
awestruck
trepidation
having
been
told
by
the
earl
of
the
generous
valor
of
wallace
and
of
the
cruel
death
of
his
lady
she
had
conceived
a
gratitude
and
a
pity
deeper
than
language
could
express
for
the
man
who
had
lost
so
much
by
succoring
one
so
dear
to
hear
she
took
the
lock
waving
in
yellow
light
upon
her
hands
and
trembling
with
emotion
was
leaving
the
room
when
she
heard
her
cousin
throw
himself
on
his
knees
i
beseech
you
my
honored
uncle
cried
he
if
you
have
love
for
me
or
value
for
my
future
fame
allow
me
to
be
the
bearer
of
your
banner
to
sir
william
wallace
helen
stopped
at
the
threshold
to
hear
the
reply
you
could
not
my
dear
nephew
returned
the
earl
have
asked
me
any
favor
i
could
grant
with
so
much
joy
i
will
collect
the
peasantry
of
bothwell
and
with
those
and
my
own
followers
you
shall
join
wallace
the
same
night
ignorant
of
the
horrors
of
war
and
only
alive
to
the
glory
of
the
present
cause
helen
sympathized
in
the
ardor
of
her
cousin
and
with
a
thrill
of
sad
delight
hurried
to
her
apartment
to
commence
her
task
far
different
were
the
sentiments
of
the
countess
her
stepmother
as
soon
as
lord
mar
had
let
this
declaration
escape
his
lips
alarmed
at
the
effect
so
much
agitation
might
have
on
his
enfeebled
constitution
and
fearful
of
the
perilous
cause
he
ventured
thus
openly
to
espouse
she
desired
his
nephew
to
take
the
now
comforted
halbert
who
was
pouring
forth
his
gratitude
to
the
earl
for
the
promptitude
of
his
orders
and
see
that
he
was
attended
with
hospitality
when
the
room
was
left
to
the
earl
and
herself
she
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
him
upon
the
facility
with
which
he
had
become
a
party
in
so
treasonable
a
matter
consider
my
lord
continued
she
that
scotland
is
now
entirely
in
the
power
of
the
english
monarch
his
garrisons
occupy
our
towns
his
creatures
hold
every
place
of
trust
in
the
kingdom
and
is
such
a
list
of
oppressions
my
dear
lady
to
be
an
argument
for
longer
bearing
them
had
i
and
other
scottish
nobles
dared
to
resist
this
overwhelming
power
after
the
battle
of
our
liberties
kept
our
own
unsheathed
within
the
bulwarks
of
our
mountains
scotland
might
now
be
free
i
should
not
have
been
insulted
by
our
english
tyrants
in
the
streets
of
lanark
and
to
save
my
life
william
wallace
would
not
now
be
mourning
his
murdered
wife
and
without
a
home
to
shelter
him
lady
mar
paused
at
this
observation
but
resumed
that
may
be
true
but
the
die
is
cast
scotland
is
lost
forever
and
by
your
attempting
to
assist
your
friend
in
this
rash
essay
to
recover
it
you
will
only
lose
yourself
also
without
preserving
him
the
project
is
wild
and
needless
what
would
you
have
now
that
the
contention
between
the
two
kings
is
past
now
that
baliol
has
surrendered
his
crown
to
edward
is
not
scotland
at
peace
a
bloody
peace
joanna
answered
the
earl
witness
these
wounds
a
usurper
peace
is
more
destructive
than
his
open
hostilities
plunder
and
assassination
are
its
concomitants
i
have
now
seen
and
felt
enough
of
edward
jurisdiction
it
is
time
i
should
awake
and
like
wallace
determine
to
die
for
scotland
or
avenge
her
lady
mar
wept
cruel
donald
is
this
the
reward
of
all
my
love
and
duty
you
tear
yourself
from
me
you
consign
your
estates
to
sequestration
you
rob
your
children
of
their
name
nay
by
your
infectious
example
you
stimulate
our
brother
bothwell
son
to
head
the
band
that
is
to
join
this
madman
wallace
hold
joanna
cried
the
earl
what
is
it
i
hear
you
call
the
hero
who
in
saving
your
husband
life
reduced
himself
to
these
cruel
extremities
a
madman
was
he
made
because
he
prevented
the
countess
of
mar
from
being
a
widow
was
he
made
because
he
prevented
her
children
from
being
fatherless
the
countess
overcome
by
this
cutting
reproach
threw
herself
upon
her
husband
neck
alas
my
lord
cried
she
all
is
madness
to
me
that
would
plunge
you
into
danger
think
of
your
own
safety
of
my
innocent
twins
now
in
their
cradle
should
you
fall
think
of
our
feeling
when
you
send
his
only
son
to
join
one
he
perhaps
would
call
a
rebel
if
earl
bothwell
considered
himself
a
vassal
of
edward
he
would
not
now
be
with
lord
from
the
moment
that
gallant
highlander
retired
to
argyleshire
the
king
of
england
regarded
his
adherents
with
suspicion
bothwell
present
visit
to
you
see
is
sufficient
to
sanction
the
plunder
of
this
castle
by
the
peaceful
government
you
approve
you
saw
the
opening
of
those
proceedings
and
had
they
come
to
their
dreadful
issue
where
my
dear
joanna
would
now
be
your
home
your
husband
your
children
it
was
the
arm
of
the
brave
chief
of
ellerslie
which
saved
them
from
destruction
lady
mar
shuddered
i
admit
the
truth
of
what
you
say
but
oh
is
it
not
hard
to
put
my
all
to
the
hazard
to
see
the
bloody
field
on
one
side
of
my
beloved
donald
and
the
mortal
scaffold
on
the
other
hush
cried
the
earl
it
is
justice
that
beckons
me
and
victory
will
receive
me
to
her
arms
let
oh
power
above
exclaimed
he
in
the
fervor
of
enthusiasm
let
the
victorious
field
for
scotland
be
donald
mar
grave
rather
than
doom
him
to
live
a
witness
of
her
miseries
i
can
not
stay
to
hear
you
answered
the
countess
i
must
invoke
the
virgin
to
give
me
courage
to
be
a
patriot
wife
at
present
your
words
are
daggers
to
me
in
uttering
this
she
hastily
withdrew
and
left
the
earl
to
muse
on
the
past
to
concert
plans
for
the
portentous
future
chapter
vii
bothwell
castle
meanwhile
the
lady
helen
had
retired
to
her
own
apartments
lord
banner
being
brought
to
her
from
the
armory
she
sat
down
to
weave
into
its
silken
texture
the
amber
locks
of
the
scottish
chief
admiring
their
softness
and
beauty
while
her
needle
flew
she
pictured
to
herself
the
fine
countenance
they
had
once
adorned
the
duller
extremities
of
the
hair
which
a
sadder
liquid
than
that
which
now
dropped
from
her
eyes
and
rendered
stiff
and
difficult
to
entwine
with
the
warp
of
the
silk
seemed
to
adhere
to
her
fingers
helen
almost
shrunk
from
the
touch
unhappy
lady
she
sighed
to
herself
what
a
pang
must
have
rent
her
heart
when
the
stroke
of
so
cruel
a
death
tore
her
from
such
a
husband
and
how
must
he
have
loved
her
when
for
her
sake
he
thus
forswears
all
future
joys
but
those
which
camps
and
victories
may
yield
ah
what
would
i
give
to
be
my
cousin
murray
to
bear
this
pennon
at
his
side
what
would
i
give
to
reconcile
so
admirable
a
being
to
happiness
again
to
weep
his
griefs
or
smile
him
into
comfort
to
be
that
man
friend
would
be
a
higher
honor
than
to
be
edward
queen
her
heart
was
thus
discoursing
with
itself
when
a
page
opened
the
door
for
her
cousin
who
begged
admittance
she
had
just
fastened
the
flowing
charge
into
its
azure
field
and
while
embroidering
the
motto
gladly
assented
you
know
not
my
good
old
man
said
the
gallant
murray
to
halbert
as
he
conducted
him
across
the
galleries
what
a
noble
mind
is
contained
in
that
lovely
young
creature
i
was
brought
up
with
her
and
to
the
sweet
contagion
of
her
taste
do
i
owe
that
love
of
true
glory
which
carries
me
to
the
side
of
sir
william
wallace
the
virtuous
only
can
awaken
any
interest
in
her
heart
and
in
these
degenerate
days
long
might
have
been
its
sleep
had
not
the
history
which
my
uncle
recounted
of
your
brave
master
aroused
her
attention
and
filled
her
with
an
admiration
equal
to
my
own
i
know
she
rejoices
in
my
present
destination
and
to
prevent
her
hearing
from
your
own
lips
all
you
have
now
told
me
of
the
mild
as
well
as
heroic
virtues
of
my
intended
commander
all
you
have
said
of
the
heroism
of
his
wife
would
be
depriving
her
of
a
mournful
pleasure
only
to
be
appreciated
by
a
heart
such
as
hers
the
bard
of
ellerslie
who
had
ever
received
the
dearest
reward
of
his
songs
in
the
smiles
of
its
mistress
did
not
require
persuasion
to
appear
before
the
gentle
lady
of
mar
or
to
recite
in
her
ears
the
story
of
the
departed
loveliness
fairer
than
poet
ever
feigned
helen
rose
as
he
and
her
cousin
appeared
murray
approved
the
execution
of
her
work
and
halbert
with
a
full
heart
took
the
pennon
in
his
hand
ah
little
did
my
dear
lady
think
exclaimed
he
that
one
of
these
loved
locks
would
ever
be
suspended
on
a
staff
to
lead
men
to
battle
what
changes
have
a
few
days
made
she
the
gentlest
of
women
laid
in
a
bloody
grave
and
he
the
most
benevolent
of
human
beings
wielding
an
exterminating
sword
you
speak
of
her
grave
venerable
man
inquired
helen
had
you
then
an
opportunity
of
performing
the
rites
of
sepulture
to
her
remains
no
madam
replied
he
after
the
worthy
english
soldier
now
in
this
castle
assisted
me
to
place
her
precious
body
in
my
lord
oratory
i
had
no
opportunity
of
returning
to
give
her
a
more
holy
grave
alas
cried
helen
then
her
sacred
relics
have
been
consumed
in
the
burning
house
i
hope
not
rejoined
halbert
the
chapel
i
speak
of
is
at
some
distance
from
the
main
building
it
was
excavated
in
the
rock
by
sir
ronald
crawford
who
gave
the
name
of
ellerslie
to
this
estate
in
compliment
to
sir
william
place
of
birth
in
renfrewshire
and
bestowed
it
on
the
bridal
pair
since
then
the
ellerslie
of
clydesdale
has
been
as
dear
to
my
master
as
that
of
the
carth
and
well
it
might
be
for
it
was
not
only
the
home
of
all
his
wedded
joys
but
under
its
roof
his
mother
the
lady
margaret
crawford
drew
her
first
breath
ah
woe
is
me
that
happy
house
is
now
like
herself
reduced
to
cold
cold
ashes
she
married
sir
malcolm
wallace
and
he
is
gone
too
both
the
parents
of
my
honored
master
died
in
the
bloom
of
their
lives
and
a
grievous
task
will
it
be
to
whoever
is
to
tell
the
good
sir
ronald
that
the
last
sweet
flower
of
ellerslie
is
now
cut
down
that
the
noblest
branch
of
his
own
stem
is
torn
from
the
soil
to
which
he
had
transplanted
it
and
cast
far
away
into
the
waste
wilderness
ellerslie
in
renfrewshire
here
referred
to
and
which
was
the
birthplace
of
william
wallace
and
the
hereditary
property
of
his
father
sir
malcolm
wallace
was
situated
in
the
abbey
parish
of
paisley
three
miles
west
of
the
won
of
paisley
and
nine
from
glasgow
a
large
old
oak
still
called
wallace
oak
stands
close
to
the
road
from
paisley
to
leith
and
within
a
short
distance
from
it
once
stood
the
manor
of
ellerslie
the
venerable
name
is
now
corrupted
into
elderslie
and
the
estate
has
become
the
property
of
archibald
spiers
for
renfrewshire
for
this
topographical
account
i
am
indebted
to
a
renfrewshire
the
tears
of
the
venerable
harper
bore
testimony
to
his
inward
resolve
that
this
messenger
should
not
be
himself
lady
helen
who
had
fallen
into
a
reverie
during
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
now
spoke
and
with
something
of
eagerness
then
we
shall
hope
rejoined
she
that
the
oratory
has
not
only
escaped
the
flames
but
perhaps
the
access
of
the
english
soldiers
would
it
not
comfort
your
lord
to
have
that
sweet
victim
entombed
according
to
the
rites
of
the
church
surely
my
lady
but
how
can
that
be
done
he
thinks
her
remains
were
lost
in
the
conflagration
of
ellerslie
and
for
fear
of
precipitating
him
into
the
new
dangers
which
might
have
menaced
him
had
he
sought
to
bring
away
her
body
i
did
not
disprove
his
mistake
but
her
body
shall
be
brought
away
rejoined
lady
helen
it
shall
have
holy
burial
to
effect
this
command
my
services
exclaimed
murray
helen
thanked
him
for
an
assistance
which
would
render
the
completion
of
her
design
easy
the
english
soldier
as
guide
and
a
troop
from
bothwell
must
accompany
him
alas
my
young
lord
interposed
halbert
suppose
you
should
meet
some
of
the
english
still
loitering
there
and
what
of
that
my
honest
halbert
would
not
i
and
my
trusty
band
make
them
clear
the
way
is
it
not
to
give
comfort
to
the
deliverer
of
my
uncle
that
i
seek
the
glen
and
shall
anything
in
mortal
shape
make
andrew
murray
turn
his
back
no
halbert
i
was
not
born
on
andrew
day
for
naught
and
by
his
bright
cross
i
swear
either
to
lay
lady
wallace
in
the
tomb
of
my
ancestors
or
leave
my
bones
to
bleach
on
the
grave
of
hers
helen
loved
the
resolution
of
her
cousin
and
believing
that
the
now
ravaged
ellerslie
had
no
attractions
to
hold
marauders
amongst
its
ruins
she
dismissed
lord
andrew
to
make
his
preparations
and
turned
herself
to
prefer
her
suit
accordingly
to
her
father
ere
halbert
withdrew
he
respectfully
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
continued
she
ere
you
see
me
again
i
trust
the
earthly
part
of
the
angel
now
in
paradise
will
be
safe
within
these
towers
he
poured
a
thousand
blessings
on
her
head
and
almost
thought
that
he
saw
in
her
beautiful
form
one
of
heaven
inhabitants
sent
to
bear
away
his
dear
mistress
to
her
divine
abode
on
entering
her
father
apartment
lady
helen
found
him
alone
she
repeated
to
him
the
substance
of
her
conversation
with
faithful
servant
and
my
wish
is
continued
she
to
have
the
murdered
lady
remains
entombed
in
the
cemetery
of
this
castle
the
earl
approved
her
request
with
expressions
of
satisfaction
at
the
filial
affection
which
so
lively
a
gratitude
to
his
preserver
evinced
may
i
then
my
dear
father
returned
she
have
your
permission
to
pay
our
debt
of
gratitude
to
sir
william
wallace
to
the
utmost
of
our
power
you
are
at
liberty
my
noble
child
to
do
as
you
please
my
vassals
my
coffers
are
all
at
your
command
helen
kissed
his
hand
may
i
have
what
i
please
from
the
bothwell
armory
command
even
there
said
the
earl
your
uncle
bothwell
is
too
true
a
scot
to
grudge
a
sword
in
so
pious
a
cause
helen
threw
her
arms
about
her
father
neck
thanking
him
tenderly
and
with
a
beating
heart
retired
to
prosecute
her
plans
murray
who
met
her
in
the
anteroom
informed
her
that
fifty
men
the
sturdiest
in
the
glen
awaited
her
orders
while
she
telling
her
cousin
of
the
earl
approval
took
the
sacred
banner
in
her
hand
and
followed
him
to
the
gallery
in
the
hall
the
moment
she
appeared
a
shout
of
joy
bade
her
welcome
murray
waved
his
hands
in
token
of
silence
while
she
smiling
with
the
benignity
that
spoke
her
angel
errand
spoke
with
agitation
my
brave
friends
said
she
i
thank
you
for
the
ardor
with
which
by
this
night
enterprise
you
assist
me
to
pay
in
part
the
everlasting
tribute
due
to
the
man
who
preserved
to
me
the
blessing
of
a
father
with
that
spirit
then
returned
she
i
address
ye
with
greater
confidence
who
amongst
you
will
shrink
from
following
this
standard
to
the
field
for
scotland
honor
who
will
refuse
to
make
himself
the
especial
guardian
of
the
life
of
sir
william
wallace
and
who
in
the
moment
of
peril
will
not
stand
by
him
to
the
last
none
are
her
cried
a
young
man
advancing
before
his
fellows
who
would
not
gladly
die
in
his
defense
we
swear
it
burst
from
every
lip
at
once
she
bowed
her
head
and
said
return
from
ellerslie
with
the
bier
of
its
sainted
mistress
i
will
then
bestow
upon
every
man
in
this
band
a
plumed
with
my
colors
and
this
banner
shall
then
lead
you
to
the
side
of
sir
william
wallace
in
the
shock
of
battle
look
at
its
golden
ensign
and
remember
that
god
not
only
armeth
the
patriot
hand
but
shieldeth
his
heart
in
this
faith
be
ye
the
bucklers
which
heaven
sends
to
guard
the
life
of
wallace
and
so
honored
exult
in
your
station
and
expect
the
future
gratitude
of
scotland
wallace
and
lady
helen
to
death
or
liberty
was
the
animated
response
to
this
exhortation
and
smiling
and
crossing
her
hands
over
her
bosom
in
token
of
thanks
of
them
and
to
heaven
she
retired
in
the
midst
of
their
acclamations
murray
ready
armed
for
his
expedition
met
her
at
the
door
restored
to
his
usual
vivacity
by
the
emotions
which
the
present
scene
awakened
in
his
heart
he
forgot
the
horror
which
had
aroused
his
zeal
in
the
glory
of
some
anticipated
victory
and
giving
her
a
gay
salutation
led
her
back
to
her
apartments
where
the
english
soldier
awaited
her
commands
lady
helen
with
a
gentle
grace
commended
his
noble
resentment
of
heselrigge
violence
lands
in
mar
shall
be
yours
added
she
or
a
post
of
honor
in
the
little
army
the
earl
is
now
going
to
raise
speak
but
the
word
and
you
shall
find
worthy
englishman
that
neither
a
scotsman
nor
his
daughter
know
what
it
is
to
be
ungrateful
the
blood
mounted
into
the
soldier
cheek
i
thank
you
sweetest
lady
for
this
generous
offer
but
as
i
am
an
englishman
i
dare
not
accept
it
my
arms
are
due
to
my
own
country
and
whether
i
am
tied
to
it
by
lands
or
possessions
or
have
naught
but
my
english
blood
and
my
oath
to
my
king
to
bind
me
still
i
should
be
equally
unwarranted
in
breaking
these
bonds
i
left
heselrigge
because
he
dishonored
my
country
and
for
me
to
forswear
her
would
be
to
make
myself
infamous
hence
all
i
ask
is
that
after
i
have
this
night
obeyed
your
gracious
commands
in
leading
your
men
to
ellerslie
the
earl
of
mar
will
allow
me
instantly
to
depart
for
the
nearest
port
lady
helen
replied
that
she
revered
his
sentiments
too
sincerely
to
insult
them
by
any
persuasions
to
the
contrary
and
taking
a
diamond
clasp
from
her
bosom
she
put
it
into
his
hand
wear
it
in
remembrance
of
your
virtue
and
of
helen
mar
gratitude
the
man
kissed
it
respectfully
and
bowing
swore
to
preserve
so
distinguishing
a
gift
to
the
latest
hour
of
his
existence
helen
retired
to
her
chamber
to
finish
her
task
and
murray
bidding
her
repaired
to
the
earl
apartments
to
take
his
final
orders
before
he
and
his
troop
set
out
for
the
ruins
of
ellerslie
chapter
viii
bothwell
chapel
night
having
passed
over
the
sleepless
heads
of
the
inhabitants
of
bothwell
castle
as
soon
as
the
sun
arose
the
earl
of
mar
was
carried
from
his
chamber
and
laid
on
a
couch
in
the
state
apartment
his
lady
had
not
yet
left
the
room
of
his
daughter
by
whose
side
she
had
lain
the
whole
night
in
hopes
of
infecting
her
with
the
fears
which
possessed
himself
helen
replied
that
she
could
see
no
reason
for
such
direful
apprehension
if
her
father
instead
of
joining
wallace
in
person
would
when
he
had
sent
him
succors
retire
with
his
family
into
the
highlands
and
there
await
the
issue
of
the
contest
it
is
too
late
to
retreat
dear
madam
continued
she
the
first
blow
against
the
public
enemy
was
struck
in
defense
of
lord
mar
and
would
you
have
my
father
act
so
base
a
part
as
to
abandon
his
preserver
to
the
wrath
such
generous
assistance
has
provoked
alas
my
child
answered
the
countess
what
great
service
will
he
have
done
to
me
or
to
your
father
if
he
deliver
him
from
one
danger
only
to
plunge
him
into
another
edward
power
in
this
country
is
too
great
to
be
resisted
now
have
not
most
of
our
barons
sworn
fealty
to
him
and
are
not
the
potent
families
of
the
cummin
the
soulis
and
the
march
all
in
his
interest
you
may
perhaps
say
that
most
of
these
are
my
relations
and
that
i
may
turn
them
which
way
i
will
but
if
i
have
no
influence
with
a
husband
it
would
be
madness
to
expect
it
over
more
distant
kindred
how
then
with
such
a
host
against
him
can
your
infatuated
father
venture
without
despair
to
support
the
man
who
breaks
the
peace
with
england
who
can
despair
honored
lady
returned
helen
in
so
just
a
cause
let
us
rather
believe
with
our
good
king
david
that
must
hope
always
for
no
real
evil
can
befall
the
virtuous
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
were
i
a
man
the
justice
that
leads
on
the
brave
wallace
would
nerve
my
arm
with
the
strength
of
a
host
besides
look
at
our
country
god
gift
of
freedom
is
stamped
upon
it
our
mountains
are
his
seal
plains
are
the
proper
territories
of
tyranny
there
the
armies
of
a
usurper
may
extend
themselves
with
ease
leaving
no
corner
unoccupied
in
which
patriotism
might
shelter
or
treason
hide
but
mountains
glens
morasses
lakes
set
bounds
to
conquest
and
amidst
these
stands
the
impregnable
seat
of
liberty
to
such
a
fortress
to
the
deep
defiles
of
loch
katrine
or
to
the
heights
of
corryarraick
i
would
have
my
father
retire
in
safety
he
may
there
watch
the
footsteps
of
our
till
led
by
her
immortal
champion
she
plants
her
standard
again
upon
the
hills
of
scotland
the
complexion
of
the
animated
helen
shone
with
a
radiant
glow
her
heart
panted
with
a
foretaste
of
the
delight
she
would
feel
when
all
her
generous
wishes
should
be
fulfilled
and
pressing
the
now
completed
banner
to
her
breast
with
an
enthusiasm
she
believed
prophetic
her
lips
moved
though
her
voice
did
not
utter
the
inexpressible
rapture
of
her
heart
lady
mar
looked
at
her
it
is
well
romantic
girl
that
you
are
of
my
own
powerless
sex
had
it
been
otherwise
your
disobedience
might
have
made
me
rue
the
day
i
became
your
father
wife
sex
returned
helen
mildly
could
not
have
altered
my
sense
of
duty
whether
man
or
woman
i
would
obey
you
in
all
things
consistent
with
my
duty
to
a
higher
power
but
when
that
commands
then
by
the
ordinance
of
heaven
we
must
father
and
mother
and
cleave
unto
it
and
what
o
foolish
helen
do
you
call
a
higher
duty
than
that
of
a
child
to
a
parent
or
a
husband
to
his
wife
duty
of
any
kind
respectfully
answered
the
young
daughter
of
mar
can
not
be
transgressed
with
innocence
nor
would
it
be
any
relinquishing
of
duty
to
you
should
my
father
leave
you
to
take
up
arms
in
the
assertion
of
his
country
rights
her
rights
are
your
safety
and
therefore
in
defending
them
a
husband
or
a
son
best
shows
his
sense
of
domestic
as
well
as
of
public
duty
who
taught
you
this
sophistry
helen
not
your
heart
for
it
would
start
at
the
idea
of
your
father
blood
helen
turned
pale
perhaps
madam
had
not
the
preservation
of
my
father
blood
occasioned
such
malignity
from
the
english
that
nothing
but
an
armed
force
can
deliver
his
preserver
i
too
might
be
content
to
see
scotland
in
slavery
but
now
to
wish
my
father
to
shrink
behind
the
excuse
of
family
duties
and
to
abandon
sir
william
wallace
to
the
blood
hounds
who
hunt
his
life
would
be
to
devote
his
name
of
mar
to
infamy
and
deservedly
bring
a
curse
upon
his
offspring
then
it
is
to
preserve
sir
william
wallace
you
are
thus
anxious
your
spirit
of
freedom
is
now
disallowed
and
all
this
mighty
gathering
is
for
him
my
husband
his
vassals
your
cousin
and
in
short
the
sequestration
of
the
estates
of
mar
and
bothwell
are
all
to
be
put
to
the
hazard
on
account
of
a
frantic
outlaw
to
whom
since
the
loss
of
his
wife
i
should
suppose
death
would
be
preferable
to
any
gratitude
we
can
pay
him
lady
helen
at
this
ungrateful
language
inwardly
thanked
heaven
that
she
inherited
no
part
of
the
blood
which
animated
so
unfeeling
a
heart
that
he
is
an
outlaw
lady
mar
springs
from
us
that
death
is
the
preferable
comforter
of
his
sorrows
also
he
owes
to
us
for
was
it
not
for
my
father
sake
that
his
wife
fell
and
that
he
himself
was
driven
into
the
wilds
i
do
not
then
blush
for
making
his
preservation
my
first
prayer
and
that
he
may
achieve
the
freedom
of
scotland
is
my
second
we
shall
see
whose
prayers
will
be
answered
first
resumed
lady
mar
rising
coldly
from
her
seat
my
saints
are
perhaps
nearer
than
yours
and
before
the
close
of
this
day
you
will
have
reason
to
repent
such
extravagant
opinions
i
do
not
understand
them
till
now
you
never
disapproved
them
i
allowed
them
in
your
infancy
replied
the
countess
because
i
thought
they
went
no
further
than
a
minstrel
song
but
since
they
are
become
so
dangerous
i
rue
the
hour
in
which
i
complied
with
the
entreaties
of
sir
richard
maitland
and
permitted
you
and
your
sister
to
remain
at
thirlestane
to
imbibe
these
romantic
ideas
from
the
wizard
of
ercildown
had
not
sir
richard
been
your
own
father
i
would
not
have
been
so
easily
prevailed
on
and
thus
am
i
rewarded
for
my
indulgence
personages
are
so
renowned
in
tradition
as
thomas
of
ercildown
usually
called
the
rhymer
he
was
a
poet
and
a
sage
and
believed
by
his
contemporaries
to
be
a
prophet
he
was
born
at
ercildown
a
village
on
the
leeder
or
lauder
where
the
ruins
of
his
paternal
castle
called
learmont
tower
still
i
hope
honored
madam
said
helen
still
wishing
to
soften
the
displeasure
of
her
i
hope
you
will
never
be
for
that
indulgence
either
by
my
grandfather
my
sister
or
myself
isabella
in
the
quiet
of
thirlestane
has
no
chance
of
giving
you
the
offense
that
i
do
and
i
am
forced
to
offend
you
because
i
can
not
disobey
my
conscience
a
tear
stood
in
the
eye
of
lady
helen
can
not
you
dear
lady
mar
continued
she
forcing
a
smile
pardon
the
daughter
of
your
early
friend
my
mother
who
loved
you
as
a
sister
can
not
you
forgive
her
helen
for
revering
justice
even
more
than
your
favor
more
influenced
by
the
sweet
humility
of
her
than
by
the
ingenuous
eloquence
with
which
she
maintained
her
sentiments
or
with
the
appeal
to
the
memory
of
the
first
lady
mar
the
countess
relaxed
the
frigid
air
she
had
assumed
and
kissing
her
with
many
renewed
injunctions
to
bless
the
hand
that
might
put
a
final
stop
to
so
ruinous
an
enthusiasm
in
her
family
she
quitted
the
room
as
soon
as
helen
was
alone
she
forgot
the
arguments
of
the
countess
and
calling
to
recollection
the
generous
permission
with
which
her
father
had
endowed
her
the
night
before
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
mantle
and
attended
by
her
page
proceeded
to
the
armory
the
armorer
was
already
there
having
just
given
out
arms
for
three
hundred
men
who
by
the
earl
orders
were
to
assemble
by
noon
on
bothwell
moor
helen
told
the
man
she
came
for
the
best
suit
of
armor
in
his
one
of
the
most
excellent
proof
he
drew
from
an
oaken
chest
a
coat
of
black
mail
studded
with
gold
helen
admired
its
strength
and
beauty
it
is
the
richest
in
all
scotland
answered
he
and
was
worn
by
our
great
canmore
in
all
his
victories
then
it
is
worthy
its
destination
bring
it
with
its
helmet
and
sword
to
my
apartment
the
armorer
took
it
up
and
accompanied
by
the
page
carrying
the
lighter
parts
followed
her
into
the
western
tower
when
helen
was
again
alone
it
being
yet
very
early
in
the
morning
she
employed
herself
in
pluming
the
casque
and
forming
the
scarf
she
meant
should
adorn
her
present
thus
time
flew
till
the
told
her
it
was
the
eighth
hour
but
ere
she
had
finished
her
task
she
was
roused
from
the
profound
stillness
in
which
that
part
of
the
castle
lay
by
the
doleful
lament
of
the
troop
returning
from
ellerslie
she
dropped
the
scarf
from
her
hand
and
listened
without
daring
to
draw
her
breath
to
the
lamentations
she
thought
that
she
had
never
before
heard
the
dirge
of
her
country
so
piercing
so
thrillingly
awful
her
head
fell
on
the
armor
and
scarf
sweet
lady
sighed
she
to
herself
who
is
it
that
dares
thus
invade
thy
duties
but
my
gratitude
gratitude
to
the
lord
will
not
offend
thy
pure
spirit
again
the
mournful
wailings
rose
on
the
air
and
with
a
convulsion
of
feelings
she
could
not
restrain
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
leaning
her
head
on
the
helmet
wept
profusely
murray
entered
the
room
unobserved
helen
my
dear
cousin
cried
he
she
started
and
rising
apologized
for
her
tears
by
owning
the
truth
he
now
told
her
that
the
body
of
the
deceased
lady
was
deposited
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
and
that
the
priests
from
the
adjacent
priory
only
awaited
her
presence
to
consign
it
with
the
church
rites
to
its
tomb
helen
retired
for
a
few
minutes
to
recover
herself
and
then
covered
with
a
black
veil
was
led
by
her
cousin
to
the
awful
scene
the
bier
lay
before
the
altar
the
prior
of
fillan
in
his
holy
vestments
stood
at
its
head
a
band
of
monks
were
ranged
on
each
side
the
maids
of
lady
helen
in
mourning
garments
met
their
mistress
at
the
portal
they
had
wrapped
the
beautiful
corpse
in
the
shroud
prepared
for
it
and
now
having
laid
it
strewed
with
flowers
upon
the
bier
they
advanced
to
their
trembling
lady
expecting
her
to
approve
their
services
helen
drew
near
she
bowed
to
the
priests
one
of
the
women
put
her
hand
on
the
pall
to
uncover
the
once
lovely
face
of
the
murdered
marion
lady
helen
hastily
resisted
the
woman
motion
by
laying
her
hand
also
upon
the
pall
the
chill
of
death
struck
through
the
velvet
to
her
touch
she
turned
pale
and
waving
her
hand
to
the
prior
to
begin
the
bier
was
lowered
by
the
priests
into
the
tomb
beneath
as
it
descended
helen
sunk
upon
her
knees
and
the
anthem
for
departed
souls
was
raised
the
pealing
notes
as
they
rose
and
swelled
seemed
to
bear
up
the
spirit
of
the
sainted
marion
to
its
native
heaven
and
the
tears
which
now
flowed
from
the
eyes
of
helen
as
they
mingled
with
her
pious
aspirations
seemed
the
balm
of
paradise
descending
upon
her
soul
when
all
was
over
the
venerable
halbert

had
concealed
his
overwhelming
sorrow
behind
a
pillar
threw
himself
on
the
cold
stone
which
now
closed
the
last
chamber
of
his
mistress
with
faint
cries
he
gave
way
to
the
woe
that
shook
his
aged
bosom
and
called
on
death
to
lay
him
low
with
her
the
women
of
lady
helen
again
chanted
forth
their
melancholy
wailings
for
the
dead
and
unable
longer
to
bear
the
scene
she
grasped
the
arm
of
her
cousin
and
with
difficulty
walked
from

the

the

and
the
clatter
of
the
arms
he
was
dispensing
prevented
anybody
present
hearing
any
sound
of
what
was
taking
place
beyond
the
room
but
the
earl
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
the
of
the
apartment
were
abruptly
opened
and
all
eyes
were
blasted
by
the
sudden
sight
of
lord

and
a
man
in
splendid

with

cried
the

while
with
a
sudden
and
dreadful
stroke
of
his
he
laid
the
body
of
the
generous
scot
a
headless
corpse
at
his
feet
a
direful
cry
proceeded
from
his
enraged
comrades
every
sword
was
drawn
and
before
the
bewildered
and
earl
could
utter
a
word
the
furies
blew
their
most
horrible
blast
through
the
chamber
and
the
mar
beheld
his
brave
scots
at
one
moment
victorious
and
in
the
next
the
floor
strewed
with
their
dead
bodies
a
new
succession
of
had
rushed
in
at
every
door
and
before
the
exterminating
sword
was
allowed
to
rest
the
whole
of
his
faithful
troops
lay
around
him
wounded
and
dying
several
had
fallen
across
his
body
having
warded
with
their
lives
the
strokes
they
believed
leveled
at
his
in
vain
his
voice
had
called
upon
his
men
to
surrender
in
vain
he
had
implored
the
soulis
and
his
coadjutor
aymer
de
valence
to
stop
the
havoc
of
death
all
now
lay
in
blood
and
the
heat
of
the
room
thronged
by
the
victors
became
so
intolerable
that
de
valence
for
his
own
sake
ordered
the
earl
to
be
removed
into
another
apartment
meanwhile
unconscious
of
these
events
helen
had
lain
down
on
her
bed
to
seek
a
few
minutes
repose
and
having
watched
the
whole
of
the
preceding
night
was
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
murray
who
was
present
at
the
abrupt
entrance
of
the
enemy
no
sooner
heard
them
declare
that
the
castle
was
surrounded
by
a
comparatively
large
army
than
he
foresaw
all
would
be
lost
on
the
instant
and
before
the
dreadful
signal
of
carnage
was
given
in
the
fall
of
the
young
scot
he
slid
behind
the
canopy
of
his
uncle
couch
and
lifting
the
arras
by
a
back
door
which
led
to
some
private
rooms
hastily
made
way
to
the
chamber
of
his
cousin
as
he
hurried
along
he
heard
a
fearful
shout
he
paused
for
a
moment
but
thinking
it
best
whatever
might
have
happened
to
secure
the
safety
of
helen
he
flew
onward
and
entered
her
room
she
lay
upon
the
bed
in
a
deep
sleep
awake
helen
he
cried
for
your
life
awake
she
opened
her
eyes
but
without
allowing
her
time
to
speak
he
hastily
added
the
castle
is
full
of
armed
men
led
hither
by
the
english
commander
aymer
de
valence
and
the
execrable
soulis
unless
you
fly
through
the
vaulted
passage
you
will
be
their
prisoner
helen
gazed
at
him
in
terror
where
is
my
father
leave
him
i
can
not
fly
in
pity
to
your
father
oh
do
not
hesitate
what
will
be
his
anguish
should
you
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
furious
man
whose
love
you
have
rejected
when
it
will
no
longer
be
in
the
power
of
a
parent
to
preserve
your
person
from
the
outrages
of
his
eager
and
avengeful
passion
if
you
had
seen
soulis
threatening
eyes
he
was
interrupted
by
a
clamor
in
the
opposite
gallery
and
the
shrieks
of
women
helen
grasped
his
arm
alas
my
poor
damsels
i
will
go
with
you
whither
you
will
to
be
far
from
him
as
murray
threw
his
arm
about
her
waist
to
impel
her
failing
steps
his
eyes
fell
on
the
banner
and
the
suit
of
armor
all
else
must
be
left
exclaimed
he
seizing
the
banner
and
hurrying
helen
forward
he
hastened
with
her
down
the
stairs
which
led
from
the
western
to
the
vaults
beneath
the
castle
on
entering
the
first
cellar
to
which
a
dim
light
was
admitted
through
a
small
grating
near
the
top
he
looked
round
for
the
archway
that
contained
the
avenue
of
their
release
having
descried
it
and
raised
one
of
the
large
flags
which
paved
the
floor
he
assisted
his
affrighted
cousin
down
a
short
flight
of
steps
into
the
secret
passage
this
whispered
he
will
carry
us
in
a
direct
line
to
the
cell
of
the
prior
of
st
fillan
but
what
will
become
of
my
father
and
lady
mar
this
flight
while
they
are
in
danger
oh
i
fear
to
complete
it
rather
fear
the
libertine
soulis
returned
murray
he
can
only
make
them
prisoners
and
even
that
injury
shall
be
of
short
duration
i
will
soon
join
the
brave
wallace
and
then
my
sweet
cousin
liberty
and
a
happy
meeting
alas
his
venerable
harper
cried
she
suddenly
remembering
halbert
should
he
be
discovered
to
have
belonged
to
wallace
he
too
will
be
massacred
by
these
merciless
men
murray
stopped
have
you
courage
to
remain
in
this
darkness
alone
if
so
i
will
seek
him
and
he
shall
accompany
us
helen
had
courage
for
anything
but
the
dangers
murray
might
encounter
by
returning
into
the
castle
but
the
generous
youth
had
entered
too
fully
into
her
apprehensions
concerning
the
old
man
to
be
withheld
should
i
be
delayed
in
coming
back
said
he
recollecting
the
possibility
of
himself
being
attacked
and
slain
go
forward
to
the
end
of
this
passage
it
will
lead
you
to
a
flight
of
stairs
ascend
them
and
by
drawing
the
bolt
of
a
door
you
will
find
yourself
at
once
in
the
prior
cell
talk
not
of
delay
replied
helen
return
quickly
and
i
will
await
you
at
the
entrance
of
the
passage
so
saying
she
swiftly
retraced
with
him
her
steps
to
the
bottom
of
the
stone
stairs
by
which
they
had
descended
he
raised
the
flag
sprung
out
of
the
aperture
and
closing
it
down
left
her
in
solitude
and
darkness
murray
passed
through
the
first
cellar
and
was
proceeding
to
the
second
among
the
catacombs
of
which
lay
the
concealed
entrance
to
the
private
stairs
when
he
saw
the
great
gates
of
the
cellar
open
and
a
large
party
of
english
soldiers
enter
they
were
conducted
by
the
butler
of
the
castle
who
seemed
to
perform
his
office
unwillingly
while
they
crowded
in
thirsty
and
riotous
aware
how
unequal
his
single
arm
would
be
to
contend
with
such
numbers
murray
at
the
first
glance
of
these
plunderers
retreated
behind
a
heap
of
casks
in
a
remote
corner
while
the
trembling
butler
was
loading
a
dozen
of
the
men
with
flasks
for
the
refreshment
of
their
masters
above
the
rest
were
helping
themselves
from
the
adjacent
catacombs
some
left
the
cellars
with
their
booty
and
others
remained
to
drink
it
on
the
spot
glad
to
escape
the
insults
of
the
soldiers
who
lay
wallowing
in
the
wine
bothwell
old
servant
quitted
the
cellar
with
the
last
company
which
bore
flagons
to
their
comrades
above
murray
listened
anxiously
in
hopes
of
hearing
from
his
garrulous
neighbors
some
intimation
of
the
fate
of
his
uncle
and
aunt
he
hearkened
in
vain
for
nothing
was
uttered
by
these
intoxicated
banditti
but
loud
boastings
of
the
number
each
had
slain
in
the
apartment
execrations
against
the
scots
for
their
obstinate
resistance
and
a
thousand
sanguinary
wishes
that
the
nation
had
but
one
neck
to
strike
off
at
a
blow
how
often
during
this
conversation
was
murray
tempted
to
rush
out
amongst
them
and
seize
a
desperate
revenge
but
the
thought
of
his
poor
cousin
now
awaiting
his
return
and
perhaps
already
suffering
dreadful
alarms
from
such
extraordinary
uproar
restrained
him
and
unable
to
move
from
his
without
precipitating
himself
into
instant
death
he
remained
nearly
an
hour
in
the
most
painful
anxiety
watching
the
dropping
to
sleep
of
this
horrid
crew
one
by
one
when
all
seemed
hushed
not
a
voice
even
in
a
whisper
startling
his
ear
he
ventured
forth
with
a
stealing
step
toward
the
slumbering
group
like
his
brave
ancestor
gaul
the
son
of
morni
he
disdained
to
stab
a
sleeping
foe
he
must
pass
them
to
reach
the
private
stairs
he
paused
and
listened
silence
still
reigned
not
even
a
hand
moved
so
deeply
were
they
sunk
in
the
fumes
of
wine
he
took
courage
and
flew
with
the
lightness
of
air
to
the
secret
door
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
it
it
opened
from
without
and
two
persons
appeared
by
the
few
rays
which
gleamed
from
the
expiring
torches
of
the
sleepers
he
could
see
that
the
first
wore
english
armor
murray
made
a
spring
and
caught
the
man
by
the
throat
when
some
one
seizing
his
arm
exclaimed
stop
my
lord
murray
it
is
the
faithful
grimsby
murray
let
go
his
hold
glad
to
find
that
both
his
english
friend
and
the
venerable
object
of
his
solicitude
were
thus
providentially
brought
to
meet
him
but
fearing
that
the
violence
of
his
action
and
halbert
exclamation
might
have
alarmed
the
sleeping
soldiers
who
drunk
as
they
were
were
too
numerous
to
be
resisted
he
laid
his
finger
on
the
tip
of
grimsby
and
motioned
to
the
astonished
pair
to
follow
him
as
they
advanced
they
perceived
one
of
the
soldiers
move
as
if
disturbed
murray
held
his
sword
over
the
sleeping
wretch
ready
to
plunge
it
into
his
heart
should
he
attempt
to
rise
but
he
became
still
again
and
the
fugitive
having
approached
the
flag
murray
drew
it
up
and
eager
to
haven
his
double
charge
he
thrust
them
together
down
the
stairs
at
that
moment
a
shriek
from
helen
who
had
discovered
by
a
gleam
of
light
which
burst
into
the
vault
a
man
descending
in
english
armor
echoed
through
the
cellars
two
of
the
soldiers
jumped
upon
their
feet
and
rushed
upon
murray
he
had
let
the
flag
drop
behind
him
but
still
remaining
by
it
in
case
of
an
opportunity
to
escape
he
received
the
strokes
of
their
weapons
upon
his
target
and
returned
them
with
equal
rapidity
one
assailant
lay
gasping
at
his
feet
but
the
clashing
of
arms
and
the
cries
of
the
survivor
had
already
awakened
the
whole
crew
with
horrid
menaces
they
threw
themselves
toward
the
young
scot
and
would
certainly
have
cut
him
to
pieces
had
he
not
snatched
the
only
remaining
torch
out
of
the
hand
of
the
staggering
soldier
and
extinguished
it
under
his
foot
bewildered
where
to
find
their
prey
with
threats
and
imprecations
they
groped
in
darkness
slashing
the
air
with
their
swords
and
not
unfrequently
wounding
each
other
in
the
vain
search
murray
was
now
far
from
their
pursuit
he
had
no
sooner
put
out
the
light
than
he
pulled
up
the
flag
and
leaping
down
drew
it
after
him
and
found
himself
in
safety
desperate
as
was
the
contest
it
had
been
short
for
he
yet
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
helen
flying
along
the
passage
the
englishman
and
halbert
on
the
first
falling
of
the
flag
not
knowing
its
spring
had
unsuccessfully
tried
to
it
that
they
might
assist
murray
in
the
tumult
above
on
his
appearing
again
so
unexpectedly
they
declared
their
joy
but
the
young
lord
impatient
to
calm
the
apprehensions
of
his
cousin
returned
no
other
answer
than
follow
me
while
he
darted
forward
terror
had
given
her
wings
and
even
prevented
her
hearing
the
low
sounds
of
murray
voice
which
he
durst
not
raise
to
a
higher
pitch
for
fear
of
being
overheard
by
the
enemy
thus
while
she
lost
all
presence
of
mind
he
did
not
come
up
with
her
till
she
fell
breathless
against
he
stairs
at
the
extremity
of
the
vault
chapter
fillan
as
soon
as
murray
found
her
within
his
arms
he
clasped
her
insensible
form
to
his
breast
and
carrying
her
up
the
steps
drew
the
bolt
of
the
door
it
opened
to
his
pressure
and
discovered
a
large
monastic
cell
into
which
the
daylight
shone
through
one
long
narrow
window
a
straw
pallet
an
altar
and
a
marble
basin
were
the
furniture
the
cell
was
solitary
the
owner
being
then
at
mass
in
the
chapel
of
the
monastery
murray
laid
down
his
burden
on
the
monk
bed
he
then
ventured
believing
as
it
was
to
restore
so
pure
a
being
to
life
it
could
not
be
sacrilege
to
throw
some
of
the
holy
water
upon
his
cousin
face
and
by
means
of
a
little
chalice
which
stood
upon
the
altar
he
poured
some
into
her
mouth
at
last
opening
her
eyes
she
recognized
the
figure
of
her
young
kinsman
leaning
over
her
the
almost
paralyzed
halbert
stood
at
her
feet
blessed
virgin
am
i
yet
safe
and
with
my
dear
andrew
oh
i
feared
you
were
slain
cried
she
bursting
into
tears
thank
god

are
both
safe
answered
he
comfort

beloved

be
treated
with
every
respect
until
de
valence
receives
further
orders
from
king
edward
but
for
wallace
cried
she
ah
where
are
now
the
succors
that
were
to
be
sent
to
him
and
without
succors
how
can
he
or
you
dearest
andrew
rescue
my
father
from
this
tyranny
do
not
despair
replied
murray
look
but
at
the
banner
you
held
fast
even
while
insensible
your
own
hands
have
engraven
my
answer
god
armeth
the
patriot
convinced
of
that
can
you
still
fear
for
you
father
i
will
join
wallace
your
own
fifty
warriors
await
me
at
the
bottom
of
cartlane
craigs
and
if
any
treachery
should
be
meditated
against
my
uncle
that
moment
we
will
make
the
towers
of
dumbarton
shake
to
their
foundation
helen
reply
was
a
deep
sigh
she
though
it
might
be
heaven
will
that
her
father
like
the
good
lord
douglas
should
fall
a
victim
to
royal
revenge
and
so
sad
were
her
forebodings
that
she
hardly
dared
to
hope
what
the
sanguine
disposition
of
her
cousin
promised
grimsby
now
came
forward
and
unloosing
an
iron
box
from
under
his
arm
put
it
into
the
hands
of
lord
murray
this
fatal
treasure
said
he
was
committed
to
my
care
by
the
earl
your
uncle
to
deliver
to
the
prior
of
st
fillan
what
does
it
contain
demanded
murray
i
never
saw
it
before
i
know
not
its
contents
returned
the
soldier
it
belongs
to
sir
william
wallace
indeed
ejaculated
helen
if
it
be
treasure
why
was
it
not
rather
sent
to
him
but
how
honest
soldier
asked
murray
did
you
escape
with
it
and
halbert
too
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
but
by
miracle
he
replied
that
as
soon
as
the
english
and
their
scottish
partisans
under
lord
soulis
had
surprised
the
castle
he
saw
that
his
only
chance
of
safety
was
to
throw
off
the
bonnet
and
plaid
and
mix
amongst
the
numerous
soldiers
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
gates
his
armor
and
his
language
showed
he
was
their
countryman
and
they
easily
believed
that
he
had
joined
the
plunderers
as
a
volunteer
from
the
army
which
at
a
greater
distance
beleaguered
the
castle
the
story
of
his
desertion
from
the
lanark
garrison
had
not
yet
reached
those
of
glasgow
and
dumbarton
and
one
or
two
men
who
had
known
him
in
former
expeditions
readily
reported
that
he
had
been
drafted
into
the
present
one
their
recognition
warranted
his
truth
and
he
had
no
difficulty
after
the
carnage
in
the
state
apartment
to
make
his
way
to
the
where
lord
aymer
de
valence
had
ordered
lord
mar
to
be
carried
he
found
the
earl
alone
and
lost
in
grief
he
knew
not
but
that
his
nephew
and
even
his
daughter
and
wife
had
fallen
beneath
the
impetuous
swords
of
the
enemy
astonished
at
seeing
the
soldier
walking
at
large
he
expressed
his
surprise
with
some
suspicions
but
grimsby
told
him
the
strategem
he
had
used
and
assured
him
lord
andrew
had
not
been
seen
since
the
onset
this
information
inspired
the
earl
with
a
hope
that
his
nephew
might
have
escaped
and
when
the
soldier
also
said
that
he
had
seen
the
countess
led
by
lord
soulis
across
the
hall
toward
the
lady
helen
apartments
while
he
overheard
him
promising
them
every
respect
the
earl
seemed
comforted
but
how
inquired
he
of
grimsby
has
this
hard
fate
befallen
us
have
you
learned
how
de
valence
knew
that
i
meant
to
take
up
arms
for
my
country
when
the
soldier
was
relating
this
part
of
the
conference
murray
interrupted
him
with
the
same
demand
on
that
head
i
can
not
fully
satisfy
you
replied
he
i
could
only
gather
from
the
soldiers
that
a
sealed
packet
had
been
delivered
to
lor
aymer
de
valence
late
last
night
at
dumbarton
castle
soulis
was
then
there
and
he
immediately
set
off
to
glasgow
for
the
followers
he
had
left
in
that
town
early
this
morning
he
joined
de
valence
and
his
legions
on
bothwell
moor
the
consequences
there
you
know
but
they
do
not
end
at
bothwell
the
gallant
at
that
name
so
mentioned
the
heart
of
helen
grew
cold
what
of
him
exclaimed
murray
no
personal
harm
yet
happened
to
sir
william
wallace
replied
grimsby
but
at
the
same
moment
in
which
de
valence
gave
orders
for
his
troops
to
march
on
bothwell
he
sent
others
to
intercept
that
persecuted
knight
escape
from
the
cartlane
craigs
that
accursed
sealed
packet
cried
murray
has
been
the
traitor
some
villian
in
bothwell
castle
must
have
written
it
whence
else
could
have
come
the
double
information
and
if
so
added
he
with
tremendous
emphasis
may
the
blast
of
slavery
ever
pursue
him
and
his
posterity
helen
shuddered
as
the
amen
to
this
frightful
malediction
was
echoed
by
the
voices
of
halbert
and
the
soldier
the
latter
continued
when
i
informed
lord
mar
of
these
measures
against
wallace
he
expressed
a
hope
that
your
first
detachment
to
his
assistance
might
with
yourself
perhaps
at
its
head
elude
their
vigilance
and
join
his
friend
this
discourse
reminded
him
of
the
iron
box
is
in
that
closet
said
his
lordship
pointing
to
an
opposite
door
you
will
find
it
beneath
the
little
altar
before
which
i
pay
my
daily
duties
to
the
allwise
dispenser
of
the
fates
of
men
else
where
would
be
my
confidence
now
take
it
thence
and
buckle
it
to
your
side
i
obeyed
and
he
then
proceeded
are
two
passages
in
this
house
which
lead
to
the
sanctuary
the
one
nearest
to
us
is
the
safest
for
you
a
staircase
from
the
closet
you
have
just
left
will
lead
you
directly
into
the
chapel
when
there
hasten
to
the
image
of
the
virgin
and
slip
aside
the
marble
tablet
on
the
back
of
the
pedestal
it
will
admit
you
to
a
flight
of
steps
descend
them
and
at
the
bottom
you
will
find
a
door
that
will
convey
you
into
a
range
of
cellars
lift
up
the
largest
in
the
second
and
you
will
be
conducted
through
a
dark
vault
to
an
iron
door
draw
the
bolt
and
remain
in
the
cell
it
will
open
to
you
till
the
owner
enters
he
is
the
prior
of
fillan
and
a
murray
give
him
this
golden
cross
which
he
well
knows
as
a
mark
you
come
from
me
and
say
it
is
my
request
that
he
assist
you
to
gain
the
as
for
the
iron
box
tell
him
to
preserve
it
as
he
would
his
life
and
never
to
give
it
up
but
to
myself
my
children
or
to
sir
william
wallace
it
rightful
master
alas
cried
halbert
that
he
had
never
been
its
owner
that
he
had
never
brought
it
to
ellerslie
to
draw
down
misery
on
his
head
trust
whatever
it
contains
its
presence
carried
blood
and
sorrow
in
its
train
wherever
it
has
been
deposited
war
and
murder
have
followed
i
trust
my
dear
master
will
never
see
it
more
he
may
indeed
never
see
it
more
murmured
helen
in
a
low
voice
where
are
now
my
proud
anticipations
of
freedom
to
scotland
alas
andrew
said
she
taking
his
hand
and
weeping
over
it
i
have
been
too
presumptuous
my
father
is
a
prisoner
and
sir
william
wallace
is
lost
cease
my
dear
helen
cried
he
cease
to
distress
yourself
these
are
merely
the
vicissitudes
of
the
great
contention
we
are
engaged
in
we
must
expect
occasional
disappointments
or
look
for
miracles
every
day
such
disasters
are
sent
as
lessons
to
teach
us
precaution
proptitude
and
patience
these
are
the
soldier
graces
my
sweet
cousin
and
depend
on
it
i
will
pay
them
due
obedience
but
why
asked
helen
taking
comfort
from
the
unsubdued
spirits
of
her
cousin
why
my
good
soldier
did
not
my
dear
father
take
advantage
of
this
sanctuary
i
urged
the
earl
to
accompany
me
returned
grimsby
but
he
said
such
a
proceeding
would
leave
his
wife
and
babes
in
unprotected
captivity
added
he
will
await
my
fate
for
the
god
of
those
who
trust
in
him
knows
that
i
do
not
fear
having
received
such
peremptory
orders
from
the
earl
i
took
my
leave
and
entering
the
chapel
by
the
way
he
directed
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
the
worthy
halbert
whom
never
having
seen
since
the
funeral
obsequies
i
supposed
had
fallen
during
the
carnage
in
the
he
was
still
kneeling
by
the
tomb
of
his
buried
mistress
i
did
not
take
long
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
and
desired
him
to
follow
me
we
descended
together
beneath
the
holy
statue
and
were
just
emerging
into
the
cellars
when
you
sir
met
us
at
the
entrance
it
was
while
we
were
yet
in
the
chapel
that
i
heard
de
valence
and
soulis
at
high
words
in
the
courtyard
the
former
in
a
loud
voice
gave
orders
that
as
lady
helen
mar
could
nowhere
be
found
the
earl
and
countess
with
their
two
infant
children
should
not
be
separated
but
be
conveyed
as
his
prisoners
to
dumbarton
castle
that
is
a
comfort
cried
helen
my
father
will
then
be
consoled
by
the
presence
of
his
wife
but
very
different
would
have
been
the
case
madam
had
you
appeared
rejoined
the
soldier
one
of
lord
de
valence
men
told
me
that
lord
soulis
intended
to
have
taken
you
and
the
countess
to
dunglass
castle
near
glasgow
while
the
sick
earl
was
to
have
been
carried
alone
to
dumbarton
and
detained
in
solitary
confinement
lord
soulis
was
in
so
dreadful
a
rage
when
you
could
not
be
found
that
he
accused
the
english
commander
of
having
leagued
with
lady
mar
to
deceived
him
in
the
midst
of
this
contention
we
descended
into
the
vaults
helen
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
how
near
she
was
to
falling
into
the
hands
of
so
fierce
a
spirit
in
his
character
he
united
every
quality
which
could
render
power
formidable
combining
prodigious
bodily
strength
with
cruelty
dissimulation
and
treachery
he
was
feared
by
the
common
people
as
a
sorcerer
and
avoided
by
the
virtuous
of
his
own
rank
as
an
enemy
to
all
public
law
and
the
violator
of
every
private
tie
helen
mar
had
twice
refused
his
hand
first
during
the
contest
for
the
kingdom
when
his
pretended
claim
to
the
crown
was
disallowed
she
was
then
a
mere
child
hardly
more
than
fourteen
but
she
rejected
him
with
abhorrence
though
stung
to
the
quick
at
being
denied
the
objects
both
of
his
love
and
ambition
at
the
same
moment
he
did
not
hesitate
at
another
period
to
renew
his
offer
to
her
at
the
fall
of
dunbar
when
he
again
founded
his
uprise
on
the
ruins
of
his
country
as
soon
as
he
had
repeated
his
oaths
of
fidelity
to
edward
he
hastened
to
thirlestane
to
throw
himself
a
second
time
at
the
feet
of
lady
helen
her
ripened
judgment
confirmed
her
youthful
dislike
of
his
ruffian
qualities
and
again
he
was
rejected
by
the
powers
of
hell
exclaimed
he
when
the
project
of
surprising
bothwell
was
imparted
to
him
if
i
once
get
that
proud
minion
into
my
grasp
she
shall
be
mine
as
i
will
and
learn
to
beg
for
even
a
look
from
the
man
who
has
humbled
her
helen
knew
not
half
the
afflictions
with
which
his
resentful
heart
had
meditated
to
subdue
and
torture
her
and
therefore
though
she
shrunk
at
the
sound
of
a
name
so
generally
infamous
yet
not
aware
of
all
the
evils
she
had
escaped
she
replied
with
languor
though
with
gratitude
to
the
almost
rapturous
congratulations
of
her
cousin
on
her
timely
flight
at
this
period
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
and
the
prior
entered
from
the
cloisters
he
started
on
seeing
his
room
filled
with
strangers
murray
took
off
his
helmet
and
approached
him
on
recognizing
the
son
of
his
patron
the
prior
inquired
his
commands
and
expressed
some
surprise
that
such
a
company
and
above
all
a
lady
could
have
passed
the
without
his
previous
notice
murray
pointed
to
the
recess
behind
the
altar
and
then
explained
to
the
good
priest
the
necessity
which
had
compelled
them
to
thus
seek
the
protection
of
fillan
lady
helen
continued
he
must
share
your
care
until
heaven
empowers
the
earl
of
mar
to
reclaim
his
daughter
and
adequately
reward
this
holy
church
the
soldier
then
presented
the
cross
with
the
iron
box
repeating
the
message
that
confided
them
also
to
his
keeping
the
prior
listened
to
these
recitals
with
sorrowful
attention
he
had
not
heard
the
noise
of
armed
men
advancing
to
the
castle
but
knowing
that
the
earl
was
making
warlike
preparations
he
had
no
suspicion
that
these
were
other
than
the
bothwell
soldiers
he
took
the
box
and
laying
it
on
the
altar
pressed
the
cross
to
his
lips
the
earl
of
mar
shall
find
that
fidelity
here
which
his
faith
in
the
church
merits
that
mysterious
chest
to
which
you
tell
me
so
terrible
a
denunciation
is
annexed
shall
be
preserved
sacred
as
the
relics
of
st
fillan
halbert
groaned
heavily
at
these
words
but
he
did
not
speak
the
father
looked
at
him
attentively
and
then
proceeded
but
for
you
virtuous
southron
i
will
give
you
a
pilgrim
habit
travel
in
that
privileged
garb
to
montrose
and
there
a
brother
of
the
church
the
prior
of
aberbrothick
will
by
a
letter
from
me
convey
you
in
a
vessel
to
normandy
thence
you
may
safely
find
your
way
to
guienne
the
soldier
bowed
his
head
and
the
priest
turning
to
lady
helen
told
her
that
a
cell
should
be
appointed
for
her
and
some
pious
woman
brought
from
the
adjoining
hamlet
to
pay
her
due
attendance
as
for
this
venerable
man
continued
he
his
silver
hairs
already
proclaim
him
near
his
heavenly
country
he
had
best
put
on
the
cowl
of
the
holy
brotherhood
and
in
the
arms
of
religion
repose
securely
till
he
passes
through
the
sleep
of
death
to
wake
in
everlasting
life
tears
started
into
the
eyes
of
halbert
i
thank
you
reverend
father
i
have
indeed
drawn
near
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
too
old
to
serve
my
dear
master
in
fields
of
blood
and
hardship
i
will
at
least
devote
my
last
hours
to
uniting
my
prayers
with
his
and
all
good
souls
for
the
repose
of
his
sainted
lady
i
accept
your
invitation
thankfully
and
considering
it
a
call
from
heaven
to
give
me
rest
i
welcome
the
day
that
marks
the
poor
harper
of
ellerslie
with
the
sacred
tonsure
the
sound
of
approaching
trumpets
and
soon
after
the
clattering
of
horses
and
the
clang
of
armor
made
an
instantaneous
silence
in
the
cell
helen
looked
fearfully
at
her
cousin
and
grasped
his
hand
murray
clasped
his
sword
with
a
firmer
hold
i
will
protect
you
with
my
life
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
but
he
soldier
heard
him
there
is
no
cause
of
alarm
rejoined
he
lord
de
valence
is
only
marching
by
on
his
way
to
dumbarton
alas
my
poor
father
cried
helen
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
the
venerable
prior
pitying
her
affliction
knelt
down
by
her
my
daughter
be
comforted
said
he
they
dare
not
commit
any
violence
on
the
earl
king
edward
too
well
understands
his
own
interest
to
allow
even
a
long
imprisonment
to
so
popular
a
nobleman
this
assurance
assisted
by
the
consolations
of
a
firm
trust
in
god
caused
her
to
raise
her
head
with
a
meek
smile
he
continued
to
speak
of
the
impregnable
hopes
of
the
christian
who
founds
his
confidence
on
omnipotence
and
while
his
words
spread
a
serenity
through
her
soul
that
seemed
the
ministration
of
a
descended
saint
she
closed
her
hands
over
her
breast
and
silently
invoked
the
protection
of
the
almighty
jehovah
for
her
suffering
parent
the
prior
seeing
her
composed
recommended
leaving
her
to
rest
and
helen
comforted
by
holy
meditations
allowing
her
cousin
to
depart
he
led
murray
and
his
companions
into
the
convent
library

house
the
march
of
de
valence
from
the
castle
having
proved
that
no
suspicion
of
any
of
its
late
inhabitants
being
still
in
the
neighborhood
remained
with
its
usurpers
grimsby
thought
he
might
depart
in
safety
and
next
morning
he
begged
permission
of
the
prior
to
commence
his
journey
i
am
anxious
to
quit
a
land
said
he
where
my
countrymen
are
committing
violences
which
make
me
blush
at
the
name
of
englishman
murray
put
a
purse
of
gold
into
the
soldier
hand
while
the
prior
covered
his
armor
with
a
pilgrim
gown
grimsby
with
a
respectful
bow
returned
the
gift
i
can
not
take
money
from
you
my
lord
but
bestow
on
me
the
sword
at
your
side
and
that
i
will
preserve
forever
murray
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
the
soldier
let
us
exchange
my
brave
friend
said
he
give
me
yours
and
it
shall
be
a
memorial
to
me
of
having
found
virtue
in
an
englishman
grimsby
unlocked
his
rude
weapon
in
a
moment
and
as
he
put
the
iron
hilt
into
the
young
scot
hand
a
tear
stood
in
his
eye
when
you
raise
this
sword
against
my
countrymen
think
on
grimsby
a
faithful
though
humble
soldier
of
the
cross
and
spare
the
blood
of
all
who
ask
for
mercy
murray
looked
a
gracious
assent
for
the
tear
of
mercy
was
infectious
without
speaking
he
gave
the
good
soldier
hand
a
parting
grasp
and
with
regret
that
superior
claims
called
so
brave
a
man
from
his
side
he
saw
him
leave
the
monastery
the
mourner
banquets
on
memory
making
that
which
seems
the
poison
of
life
its
ailment
during
the
hours
of
regret
we
recall
the
images
of
departed
joys
and
in
weeping
over
each
tender
remembrance
tears
so
softly
shed
embalm
the
wounds
of
grief
to
be
denied
the
privilege
of
pouring
forth
our
love
and
our
lamentations
over
the
grave
of
one
who
in
life
was
our
happiness
is
to
shut
up
the
soul
of
the
survivor
in
a
solitary
tomb
where
the
bereaved
heart
pines
in
secret
till
it
breaks
with
the
fullness
of
uncommunicated
sorrow
but
listen
to
the
mourner
give
his
feelings
way
and
like
the
river
rolling
from
the
hills
into
the
valley
they
will
flow
with
a
gradually
gentler
stream
till
they
become
lost
in
time
wide
ocean
so
murray
judged
when
the
poor
old
harper
finding
himself
alone
with
him
again
gave
loose
to
his
griefs
he
wept
like
an
infant
and
recounting
the
afflictions
of
his
master
while
bewailing
the
disasters
at
bothwell
implored
murray
to
go
without
delay
to
support
the
now
almost
friendless
wallace
murray
was
consoling
him
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
set
off
for
the
mountains
that
very
evening
when
the
prior
returned
to
conduct
halbert
to
a
cell
appointed
for
his
novitiate
the
good
priest
had
placed
one
of
his
most
pious
fathers
there
to
administer
both
temporal
and
spiritual
cordials
to
the
aged
sufferer
the
sorrowing
domestic
of
wallace
being
thus
disposed
of
the
prior
and
murray
remained
together
consulting
on
the
safest
means
of
passing
to
the
cartlane
hills
a
lay
brother
whom
the
prior
had
sent
in
pursuit
of
helen
fifty
warriors
to
apprise
them
of
the
english
being
in
the
craigs
at
this
juncture
entered
the
library
he
informed
the
father
that
secure
in
his
religious
garb
he
had
penetrated
many
of
the
cartlane
defiles
but
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
of
the
party
every
glen
or
height
was
occupied
by
the
english
and
from
a
woman
of
whom
he
begged
a
draught
of
milk
he
had
learned
how
closely
the
mountains
were
invested
the
english
commander
in
his
zeal
to
prevent
provisions
being
conveyed
to
wallace
and
his
famishing
garrison
had
stopped
a
procession
of
monks
bearing
a
dead
body
to
the
sepulchral
cave
of
columba
he
would
not
allow
them
to
ascend
the
heights
until
he
had
examined
whether
the
bier
really
bore
a
corpse
or
was
a
vehicle
to
carry
food
to
the
beleaguered
scots
in
the
midst
of
this
information
the
prior
and
his
friends
were
startled
by
a
shout
and
soon
after
a
tumult
of
voices
in
which
might
be
distinguished
the
cry
of
a
gallows
for
the
traitor
our
brave
englishman
has
fallen
into
their
hands
cried
murray
hastening
toward
the
door
what
would
you
do
interrupted
the
prior
holding
him
your
single
arm
could
not
save
the
soldier
the
cross
has
more
power
i
will
seek
these
violent
men
meanwhile
stay
here
as
you
value
the
lives
of
all
in
the
convent
murray
had
now
recollected
himself
and
acquiesced
the
prior
took
the
crucifix
from
the
altar
and
ordering
the
porter
to
throw
open
the
great
doors
near
which
the
incessant
shouting
seemed
to
proceed
he
appeared
before
a
turbulent
band
of
soldiers
who
were
dragging
a
man
along
fast
bound
with
their
leathern
belts
blood
trickling
from
his
face
fell
on
the
hands
of
the
ruthless
wretches
who
with
horrid
yells
were
threatening
him
with
instant
death
the
prior
raising
the
cross
rushed
in
among
them
and
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
son
who
died
on
that
tree
bade
them
stand
the
soldiers
trembled
before
the
holy
majesty
of
his
figure
and
at
his
awful
adjuration
the
prior
looked
on
the
prisoner
but
he
did
not
see
the
dark
locks
of
the
englishman
it
was
the
yellow
hair
of
scotland
that
mingled
with
the
blood
on
his
forehead
whither
do
you
hurry
that
wounded
man
to
his
death
answered
a
surly
fellow
what
is
his
offense
he
is
a
traitor
how
has
he
proved
it
he
is
a
scot
and
he
belongs
to
the
disloyal
lord
of
mar
this
bugle
with
its
crowned
falcon
proves
it
added
the
southron
holding
up
the
very
bugle
which
the
earl
had
sent
by
halbert
to
wallace
and
which
was
ornamented
with
the
crest
of
mar
wrought
in
gold
that
this
has
been
lord
mar
replied
the
prior
there
is
no
doubt
but
may
not
this
man
have
found
it
or
may
it
not
have
been
given
to
him
by
the
earl
before
that
chief
incurred
the
displeasure
of
king
edward
which
of
you
would
think
it
just
to
be
made
to
die
because
your
friend
was
condemned
to
the
scaffold
unless
you
substantiate
your
charge
against
this
man
by
a
better
proof
than
this
bugle
his
death
would
be
a
murder
which
the
lord
of
life
will
requite
in
the
perdition
of
your
souls
as
the
father
spoke
he
again
elevated
the
cross
the
men
turned
pale
i
am
a
minister
of
christ
continued
he
and
must
be
the
friend
of
justice
release
therefore
that
wounded
man
to
me
before
the
altar
of
the
searcher
of
all
hearts
he
shall
confess
himself
and
if
i
find
that
he
is
guilty
unto
death
i
promise
you
by
the
holy
fillan
to
release
him
to
your
commanding
officer
and
so
let
justice
take
its
course
but
if
he
proves
innocent
i
am
the
soldier
of
christ
and
no
monarch
on
earth
shall
wrest
his
children
from
the
protection
of
the
church
while
he
spoke
the
men
who
held
the
prisoner
let
go
their
hold
and
the
prior
stretching
out
his
hand
gave
him
to
a
party
of
monks
to
conduct
into
the
convent
then
to
convince
the
soldiers
that
it
was
the
man
life
he
sought
to
save
and
not
the
spoil
he
returned
the
golden
bugle
and
bade
him
depart
in
peace
awed
by
the
father
address
and
satisfied
with
the
money
and
arms
of
which
they
had
rifled
the
stranger
the
marauders
retreated
determining
indeed
to
say
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
officer
in
the
castle
lest
he
should
demand
the
horn
and
elated
with
the
present
booty
they
marched
off
to
pursue
their
plundering
excursion
bursting
into
yeomen
houses
and
peasants
huts
stripping
all
of
their
substance
who
did
or
did
not
swear
fealty
to
edward
thus
robbing
the
latter
and
exacting
contributions
from
the
former
while
vain
prayers
for
mercy
and
unanswered
cries
for
redress
echoed
dolefully
through
the
vale
of
bothwell
they
sped
gayly
on
as
if
murder
were
pastime
and
rapine
honor
the
prior
on
returning
into
the
convent
ordered
the
gates
to
be
bolted
when
he
entered
the
finding
the
monks
had
already
bound
up
the
wounds
of
the
stranger
he
made
a
sign
for
the
brethren
to
withdraw
and
then
approaching
the
young
man
my
son
said
he
in
a
mild
tone
you
heard
my
declaration
to
the
men
from
whom
i
took
you
answer
me
the
truth
and
you
shall
find
that
virtue
or
repentance
have
alike
a
refuge
in
the
arms
of
the
church
as
i
am
its
servant
no
man
need
fear
to
confide
in
me
speak
with
candor
how
came
you
by
that
bugle
the
stranger
looked
steadfastly
on
his
questioner
a
minister
of
the
all
righteous
god
can
not
mean
to
deceive
you
have
saved
my
life
and
i
should
be
less
than
man
could
i
doubt
the
evidence
of
that
deed
i
received
that
bugle
from
a
brave
scot
who
dwells
amongst
the
eastern
mountains
and
who
gave
it
to
me
to
assure
the
earl
of
mar
that
i
came
from
him
the
prior
apprehended
that
it
was
of
wallace
he
spoke
you
come
to
request
a
military
aid
from
the
earl
of
mar
rejoined
the
father
willing
to
sound
him
before
he
committed
murray
by
calling
him
to
the
conference
the
stranger
replied
if
reverend
sir
you
are
in
the
confidence
of
the
good
earl
pronounce
but
the
christian
name
of
the
man
who
charged
me
with
the
bugle
and
allow
me
then
for
his
sake
to
ask
you
what
has
indeed
happened
to
the
earl
that
i
was
seized
by
foes
when
i
expected
to
meet
with
friends
only
reply
to
this
and
i
shall
speak
freely
but
at
present
though
i
would
confide
all
of
myself
to
your
sacred
character
yet
the
confidence
of
others
is
not
mine
to
bestow
the
prior
being
convinced
by
this
caution
that
he
was
indeed
speaking
with
some
messenger
from
wallace
made
no
hesitation
to
answer
your
master
is
a
knight
and
a
braver
never
drew
breath
since
the
time
of
his
royal
namesake
william
the
lion
the
man
rose
hastily
from
his
seat
and
falling
on
his
knees
before
the
prior
put
his
garment
to
his
lips
father
i
now
know
that
i
am
with
a
friend
of
my
persecuted
master
but
if
indeed
the
situation
of
lord
mar
precludes
assistance
from
him
all
hope
is
lost
the
noble
wallace
is
penned
within
the
hills
without
any
hopes
of
escape
suffer
me
then
thou
venerable
saint
to
rejoin
him
immediately
that
i
may
at
least
die
with
my
friend
hope
for
a
better
destiny
returned
the
prior
i
am
a
servant
and
not
to
be
worshiped
turn
to
that
altar
and
kneel
to
him
who
can
alone
send
the
succor
you
need
the
good
man
thinking
it
was
now
time
to
call
the
young
lord
of
bothwell
by
a
from
the
entered
the
library
where
murray
was
anxiously
awaiting
his
return
on
his
entrance
the
impatient
youth
eagerly
exclaimed
have
you
rescued
him
grimsby
i
hope
is
far
and
safely
on
his
journey
answered
the
good
priest
but
the
man
those
murderers
were
dragging
to
death
is
in
the
follow
me
and
he
will
give
you
news
of
wallace
murray
gladly
obeyed
at
sight
of
a
scottish
knight
in
armor
the
messenger
of
wallace
thought
his
prayers
were
answered
and
that
he
saw
before
him
the
leader
of
the
host
which
was
to
march
to
the
preservation
of
his
brave
commander
murray
told
him
who
he
was
and
learned
from
him
in
return
that
wallace
now
considered
himself
in
a
state
of
siege
that
the
women
children
and
old
men
with
him
had
nothing
to
feed
on
but
wild
strawberries
and
birds
eggs
which
they
found
in
the
hollows
of
the
rocks
to
relieve
them
from
such
hard
quarters
girded
by
a
barrier
of
english
soldiers
continued
the
narrator
is
his
first
wish
but
that
can
not
be
effected
by
our
small
number
however
he
would
make
the
attempt
by
a
strategem
could
we
be
at
all
supported
by
succors
from
the
earl
of
mar
my
uncle
means
replied
murray
are
for
a
time
cut
off
but
mine
shall
be
exerted
to
the
utmost
did
you
not
meet
somewhere
a
company
of
scots
to
the
number
of
fifty
i
sent
them
off
yesterday
to
seek
your
noble
chief
no
rejoined
the
young
man
i
fear
they
have
been
taken
by
the
enemy
for
in
my
way
to
sir
william
wallace
not
knowing
the
english
were
so
close
to
his
sanctuary
i
was
nearly
seized
myself
i
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
be
with
him
when
he
struck
the
first
blow
for
scotland
in
the
citadel
of
lanark
but
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
tale
of
his
wrongs
and
that
he
had
retired
in
arms
toward
the
cartlane
craigs
i
determined
to
follow
his
fate
we
had
been
companions
in
our
boyish
days
and
friends
after
he
saved
my
life
once
in
swimming
and
now
that
a
formidable
nation
menaces
his
i
seek
to
repay
the
debt
for
this
purpose
a
few
nights
ago
i
left
my
guardian
house
by
stealth
and
sought
my
way
to
my
friend
i
found
the
banks
of
the
mouse
occupied
by
the
english
but
exploring
the
most
intricate
passes
at
last
gained
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
on
the
top
of
which
wallace
is
encamped
and
as
i
lay
among
the
bushes
watching
an
opportunity
to
ascend
i
perceived
two
english
soldiers
near
me
they
were
in
discourse
and
i
overheard
them
say
that
besides
heselrigge
himself
nearly
two
hundred
of
his
garrison
had
fallen
by
the
hand
of
men
in
the
contention
at
the
castle
that
the
tidings
were
sent
to
sir
richard
arnulf
the
of
ayr
and
he
had
dispatched
a
thousand
men
to
surround
the
cartland
craigs
spies
having
given
notice
that
they
were
sir
william
strongholds
and
the
orders
were
that
he
must
be
taken
dead
or
alive
while
all
his
adherents
men
and
women
should
receive
no
quarter
such
was
the
information
i
brought
to
my
gallant
friend
when
in
the
dead
of
night
i
mounted
the
rock
and
calling
to
the
scottish
sentinel
in
gaelic
gave
him
my
name
and
was
allowed
to
enter
the
sacred
spot
wallace
welcomed
his
faithful
ker
and
soon
unfolded
his
distress
and
his
hopes
he
told
me
of
the
famine
that
threatened
his
little
garrison
of
the
constant
watching
day
and
night
necessary
to
prevent
a
surprise
but
in
his
extremity
he
observed
that
one
defile
was
thinly
guarded
by
the
enemy
probably
because
as
it
lay
at
the
bottom
of
a
perpendicular
angle
of
the
rock
they
thought
it
unattainable
by
the
scots
to
this
point
however
my
dauntless
friend
turns
his
eyes
he
would
attempt
it
could
he
procure
a
sufficient
number
of
fresh
men
to
cover
the
retreat
of
his
exhausted
few
for
this
purpose
as
i
had
so
lately
explored
the
most
hidden
paths
of
the
craigs
i
volunteered
to
visit
the
lord
mar
and
to
conduct
in
safety
any
succors
he
might
send
to
our
persecuted
leader
stem
of
this
brave
name
in
subsequent
times
became
two
great
branches
the
roxburghe
and
the
lothian
this
continued
ker
was
the
errand
on
which
i
came
to
the
earl
think
then
my
horror
when
in
my
journey
i
found
redoubled
legions
hemming
in
the
hills
and
on
advancing
toward
bothwell
castle
was
seized
with
that
nobleman
who
they
said
was
condemned
to
lose
his
head
not
so
bad
as
that
my
brave
ker
cried
murray
a
glow
of
indignation
flushing
his
cheek
many
a
bull
shall
frown
in
this
land
on
the
southron
tables
before
my
uncle
neck
gluts
their
axes
no
true
scottish
blood
i
trust
will
ever
stain
their
scaffolds
for
while
we
have
arms
to
wield
a
sword
he
must
be
a
fool
that
grounds
them
on
any
other
terms
than
freedom
or
death
we
have
cast
our
lives
on
the
die
and
wallace
camp
or
the
narrow
house
must
be
our
prize
bull
head
presented
at
a
feast
was
a
sign
that
some
one
of
the
company
was
immediately
to
be
put
to
noble
youth
exclaimed
the
prior
may
the
innocence
which
gives
animation
to
your
courage
continue
its
moving
soul
they
only
are
invincible
who
are
as
ready
to
die
as
to
live
and
no
one
can
be
firm
in
that
principle
whose
exemplary
life
is
not
a
happy
preparation
for
the
awful
change
murray
bowed
modestly
to
this
pious
encomium
and
turning
to
ker
informed
him
that
since
he
must
abandon
all
hope
of
hearing
any
more
of
the
fifty
brave
men
his
cousin
helen
had
sent
to
the
craigs
he
bethought
him
of
applying
to
his
uncle
sir
john
murray
who
dwelt
hard
by
on
his
estate
at
drumshargard
it
is
small
said
he
and
can
not
afford
many
men
but
still
he
may
spare
sufficient
to
effect
the
escape
of
our
commander
and
that
for
the
present
will
be
a
host
to
accomplish
his
design
without
delay
for
promptitude
is
the
earnest
of
success
and
to
avoid
a
surprise
from
the
english
lieutenant
at
bothwell
who
hearing
of
the
reencounter
before
the
castle
might
choose
to
demand
his
men
prisoner
murray
determined
to
take
ker
with
him
and
disguised
as
peasants
as
soon
as
darkness
should
shroud
their
movements
proceed
to
drumshargard
chapter
xii
drumshargard
while
these
transactions
occupied
the
morning
lady
helen
who
the
night
before
had
been
removed
into
the
quiet
cell
appointed
for
her
slept
long
and
sweetly
her
exhausted
frame
found
renovation
and
she
awoke
with
a
heavenly
calm
at
her
heart
a
cheering
vision
had
visited
her
sleeping
thoughts
and
a
trance
of
happy
feelings
absorbed
her
senses
while
her
hardly
disengaged
spirit
still
hovered
over
its
fading
images
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
a
young
knight
enter
her
cell
bearing
her
father
in
his
arms
he
laid
the
earl
down
before
her
but
as
she
stooped
to
embrace
him
the
knight
took
her
by
the
hand
leading
her
to
the
window
of
the
apartment
which
seemed
extended
to
an
immense
size
he
smiled
and
said
look
out
and
see
how
i
have
performed
my
vow
she
obeyed
and
saw
crowds
of
rejoicing
people
who
at
sight
of
the
young
warrior
raised
such
a
shout
that
helen
awoke
she
started
she
looked
around
she
was
still
in
the
narrow
cell
and
lone
but
the
rapture
of
beholding
her
father
yet
fluttered
in
her
breast
and
the
touch
of
the
warrior
hand
seemed
still
warm
upon
hers
angels
of
rest
cried
she
i
thank
ye
for
this
blessed
vision
the
prior
of
fillan
might
have
read
his
own
just
sentiment
in
the
heart
of
lady
helen
while
the
gentlest
of
human
beings
she
was
an
evidence
that
an
ardent
and
pious
mind
contains
the
true
principles
of
heroism
hope
in
such
a
mind
treads
down
impossibilities
and
regardless
of
impediments
or
dangers
rushes
forward
to
seize
the
prize
in
the
midst
of
hosts
it
feels
a
conqueror
power
or
when
its
strength
fails
sees
by
the
eye
of
faith
legions
of
angels
watching
to
support
the
natural
weakness
lady
helen
knew
that
the
cause
was
just
which
had
put
the
sword
into
the
hand
of
wallace
that
it
was
virtue
which
had
prompted
her
father
to
second
him
and
where
justice
is
there
are
the
wings
of
the
most
high
stretched
out
as
a
shield
this
dream
seemed
prophetic
yes
cried
she
though
thousands
of
edward
soldiers
surrounded
my
father
and
his
friend
i
should
not
despair
thy
life
o
noble
wallace
was
not
give
to
be
extinguished
in
an
hour
thy
morn
has
hardly
risen
the
perfect
day
must
come
that
is
to
develop
thy
greatness
that
is
to
prove
thee
and
oh
gracious
god
grant
my
prayer
the
glory
of
scotland
owing
to
the
fervor
of
her
apostrophe
she
did
not
observe
the
door
of
the
cell
open
till
the
prior
stood
before
her
after
expressing
his
pleasure
at
the
renovation
in
her
countenance
he
informed
her
of
the
departure
of
the
english
soldier
and
of
the
alarm
which
he
and
murray
had
sustained
for
his
safety
by
the
adventure
which
had
thrown
a
stranger
from
the
craigs
into
their
protection
at
the
mention
of
that
now
momentous
spot
she
blushed
the
warrior
of
her
dream
seemed
ready
to
rise
before
her
and
with
a
beating
heart
she
prepared
to
hear
some
true
but
miraculous
account
of
her
father
rescue
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
in
her
young
and
eager
mind
the
prior
calmly
proceeded
to
relate
all
that
ker
had
told
of
the
dangerous
extremity
to
which
wallace
was
reduced
and
then
closed
his
intelligence
by
mentioning
the
attempt
which
meditated
to
save
him
the
heightened
color
gradually
faded
from
the
face
of
helen
and
low
sighs
were
her
only
responses
to
the
observations
the
good
priest
made
on
the
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
but
when
his
pity
for
the
brave
man
engaged
in
the
cause
betrayed
him
into
expressing
his
fears
that
the
patriotic
zeal
of
wallace
would
only
make
him
and
them
a
sacrifice
helen
looked
up
there
was
inspiration
on
her
lips
and
in
her
eyes
father
said
she
hast
thou
not
taught
me
that
god
shieldeth
the
patriot
as
well
as
armeth
him
true
returned
he
with
an
answering
smile
steadily
believe
this
and
where
will
be
the
sighs
you
have
just
been
breathing
nature
will
shrink
replied
she
but
the
christian
hope
checks
her
ere
she
falls
pardon
me
then
holy
father
that
i
sometimes
weep
but
they
are
often
tears
of
trust
and
consolation
daughter
of
heaven
replied
the
good
prior
you
might
teach
devotion
to
age
and
cause
youth
to
be
enamored
of
the
graces
of
religion
be
ever
thus
and
you
may
look
with
indifference
on
the
wreck
of
worlds
helen
having
meekly
replied
to
this
burst
from
the
heart
of
the
holy
man
begged
to
see
her
cousin
before
he
set
off
on
his
expedition
the
prior
withdrew
and
within
an
hour
after
murray
entered
the
apartment
their
conversation
was
long
and
their
parting
full
of
an
interest
that
dissolved
them
both
into
tears
when
i
see
you
again
my
brave
cousin
tell
me
that
my
father
is
free
and
his
preserver
safe
your
own
life
dear
andrew
added
she
as
he
pressed
his
cheek
to
hers
must
always
be
precious
to
me
murray
hastily
withdrew
and
helen
was
again
alone
the
young
chieftain
and
ker
covered
their
armor
with
shepherd
plaids
and
having
received
a
thousand
blessings
from
the
prior
and
halbert
proceeded
under
shelter
of
the
night
through
the
obscurest
paths
of
the
wood
which
divided
bothwell
from
drumshargard
sir
john
murray
was
gone
to
rest
when
his
nephew
arrived
but
lord
andrew
voice
being
well
known
by
the
porter
he
was
admitted
into
the
house
and
leaving
his
companion
in
the
went
to
the
apartment
of
his
uncle
the
old
knight
was
soon
aroused
and
welcomed
his
nephew
with
open
arms
for
he
had
feared
from
the
accounts
brought
by
the
fugitive
tenants
of
bothwell
that
he
also
had
been
carried
away
prisoner
murray
now
unfolded
his
errand
first
to
obtain
a
band
of
sir
trustiest
people
to
assist
in
rescuing
the
preserver
of
the
earl
life
from
immediate
destruction
and
secondly
if
a
commission
for
lord
mar
release
did
not
arrive
from
king
edward
to
aid
him
to
free
his
uncle
and
the
countess
from
dumbarton
castle
sir
john
listened
with
growing
anxiety
to
his
nephew
details
when
he
heard
of
lady
helen
continuing
in
the
convent
he
highly
approved
it
that
is
well
said
he
so
bring
her
to
any
private
protection
would
only
spread
calamity
she
might
be
traced
and
her
protector
put
in
danger
none
but
the
church
with
safety
to
itself
can
grant
asylum
to
the
daughter
of
a
state
prisoner
then
i
doubly
rejoice
she
is
there
replied
murray
and
there
she
will
remain
till
your
generous
assistance
empowers
me
to
rescue
her
father
lord
mar
has
been
very
rash
nephew
returned
drumshargard
what
occasion
was
there
for
him
to
volunteer
sending
men
to
support
sir
william
wallace
and
how
durst
he
bring
ruin
on
bothwell
castle
by
collecting
unauthorized
by
my
brother
its
vassals
for
so
dangerous
an
experiment
murray
started
at
these
unexpected
observations
he
knew
his
uncle
was
timid
but
he
had
never
suspected
him
of
meanness
however
in
consideration
of
the
respect
he
owed
to
him
as
his
father
brother
he
smothered
his
disgust
and
gave
him
a
mild
answer
but
the
old
man
could
not
approve
of
a
nobleman
of
his
rank
running
himself
his
fortune
and
his
friends
into
peril
to
pay
any
debt
of
gratitude
and
as
to
patriotic
sentiments
being
a
stimulus
he
treated
the
idea
with
contempt
trust
me
andrew
said
he
nobody
profits
by
these
notions
but
thieves
and
desperate
fellows
ready
to
become
thieves
i
do
not
understand
you
sir
not
understand
me
replied
the
knight
rather
impatiently
who
suffers
in
these
contests
for
liberty
as
you
choose
to
call
them
but
such
men
as
lord
mar
and
your
father
betrayed
by
artful
declamation
they
rush
into
conspiracies
against
the
existing
government
are
detected
ruined
and
perhaps
finally
lose
their
lives
who
gains
by
rebellion
but
a
few
penniless
wretches
that
embrace
these
vaunted
principles
from
the
urgency
of
their
necessities
they
acquire
plunder
under
the
mask
of
extraordinary
disinterestedness
and
hazarding
nothing
of
themselves
but
their
worthless
lives
they
would
make
tools
of
the
first
men
in
the
realm
and
throw
the
whole
country
into
flames
that
they
may
catch
a
few
brands
from
the
fire
young
murray
felt
his
anger
rise
with
this
speech
you
do
not
speak
to
my
point
sir
i
do
not
come
here
to
dispute
the
general
evil
of
revolt
but
to
ask
your
assistance
to
snatch
two
of
the
bravest
men
in
scotland
from
the
fangs
of
the
tyrant
who
has
made
you
a
slave
nephew
cried
the
knight
starting
from
his
couch
and
darting
a
fierce
look
at
him
if
any
man
but
one
of
my
own
blood
had
uttered
that
word
this
hour
should
have
been
his
last
every
man
sir
continued
murray
who
acts
upon
your
principles
must
know
himself
to
be
a
slave
to
resent
being
called
so
is
to
affront
his
conscience
a
name
is
nothing
the
fact
ought
to
knock
upon
your
heart
and
there
arouse
the
indignation
of
a
scot
and
a
murray
see
you
not
the
villages
of
your
country
burning
around
you
the
castles
of
your
chieftains
razed
to
the
ground
did
not
the
plains
of
dunbar
reek
with
the
blood
of
your
kinsmen
and
even
now
do
you
not
see
them
led
away
in
chains
to
the
strongholds
of
the
tyrant
are
not
your
stoutest
vassals
pressed
from
your
service
and
sent
into
foreign
wars
and
yet
you
exclaim
see
no
injury
i
spurn
at
the
name
of
slave
murray
rose
from
his
seat
as
he
ended
and
walking
the
room
in
agitation
did
not
perceive
the
confusion
of
his
uncle
who
at
once
overcome
with
conviction
and
fear
again
ventured
to
speak
it
is
too
sure
you
speak
truth
andrew
but
what
am
i
or
any
other
private
individual
that
we
should
make
ourselves
a
forlorn
hope
for
the
whole
nation
will
baliol
who
was
the
first
to
bow
to
the
usurper
will
he
thank
us
for
losing
our
heads
in
resentment
of
his
indignity
bruce
himself
the
rightful
heir
of
the
crown
leaves
us
to
our
fates
and
has
become
a
courtier
in
england
for
whom
then
should
i
adventure
my
gray
hairs
and
the
quiet
of
my
home
to
seek
an
uncertain
liberty
and
to
meet
an
almost
certain
death
for
scotland
uncle
replied
he
just
laws
are
her
right
you
are
her
son
and
if
you
do
not
make
one
in
the
grand
attempt
to
rescue
her
from
the
bloodhounds
which
tear
her
vitals
the
guilt
of
parricide
will
be
on
your
soul
think
not
sir
to
preserve
your
home
or
even
your
gray
hairs
by
hugging
the
chains
by
which
you
are
bound
you
are
a
scot
and
that
is
sufficient
to
arm
the
enemy
against
your
property
and
life
remember
the
fate
of
lord
monteith
at
the
very
time
he
was
beset
by
the
parasites
of
edward
and
persuaded
by
their
flatteries
to
be
altogether
as
an
englishman
in
that
very
hour
when
he
had
taken
a
niece
of
cressingham
to
his
arms
by
her
hands
the
vengeance
of
edward
reached
fell
murray
saw
that
his
uncle
was
struck
and
that
he
trembled
but
i
am
too
insignificant
andrew
you
are
the
brother
of
lord
bothwell
answered
murray
with
all
the
dignity
of
his
father
rising
in
his
countenance
his
large
possessions
made
him
a
traitor
in
the
eyes
of
the
representatives
cressingham
as
treasurer
for
the
crew
has
already
sent
his
lieutenant
to
lord
it
in
our
paternal
castle
and
do
not
deceive
yourself
in
believing
that
some
one
of
his
officers
will
not
require
the
fertile
fields
of
drumshargard
as
a
reward
for
his
services
no
not
yourself
with
the
idea
that
the
brother
of
lord
bothwell
will
be
too
insignificant
to
share
in
the
honor
of
bearing
a
part
in
the
confiscations
of
his
country
trust
me
my
uncle
the
forbearance
of
tyrants
is
not
that
of
mercy
but
of
convenience
when
they
need
your
wealth
or
your
lands
your
submission
is
forgotten
and
a
prison
or
the
ax
ready
to
give
them
quiet
possession
sir
john
murray
though
a
timid
and
man
now
fully
comprehended
his
nephew
reasoning
and
his
fears
taking
a
different
turn
he
hastily
declared
his
determination
to
set
off
immediately
for
the
highlands
in
the
morning
by
daybreak
said
he
i
will
commence
my
journey
and
join
my
brother
at
for
i
can
not
believe
myself
safe
a
moment
while
so
near
the
garrisons
of
the
enemy
murray
approved
this
plan
and
after
obtaining
his
leave
to
take
thirty
men
from
his
vassals
he
returned
to
ker
to
inform
him
of
the
success
of
his
mission
it
was
not
necessary
neither
would
it
have
been
agreeable
to
his
pride
to
relate
the
arguments
which
had
been
required
to
obtain
this
small
assistance
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
he
brought
together
the
appointed
number
of
the
bravest
men
on
the
estate
when
equipped
he
led
them
into
the
hall
to
receive
the
last
command
from
their
feudal
lord
on
seeing
them
armed
with
every
man
his
drawn
dirk
in
his
hand
sir
john
turned
pale
murray
with
the
unfolded
banner
of
mar
in
his
grasp
and
ker
by
his
side
stood
at
their
head
young
men
said
the
old
knight
striving
to
speak
in
a
firm
tone
in
this
expedition
you
are
to
consider
yourselves
the
followers
of
my
nephew
he
is
brave
and
honourable
therefore
i
commit
you
to
his
command
but
as
you
go
on
his
earnest
petition
i
am
not
answerable
to
any
man
for
the
enterprises
to
which
he
may
lead
you
be
they
all
on
my
own
head
cried
murray
blushing
at
his
pusillanimity
and
drawing
out
his
sword
with
an
impatience
that
made
the
old
knight
start
we
now
have
your
permission
to
depart
sir
sir
john
gave
a
ready
assent
he
was
anxious
to
get
so
a
youth
out
of
his
house
and
to
collect
his
gold
and
servants
that
he
might
commence
his
own
flight
by
break
of
day
it
was
still
dark
as
midnight
when
murray
and
his
little
company
passed
the
heights
above
drumshargard
and
took
their
rapid
though
silent
march
toward
the
cliffs
which
would
conduct
them
to
the

banks
of
the
clyde
two
days
passed
drearily
away
to
helen
she
could
not
expect
tidings
from
her
cousin
in
so
short
a
time
no
more
happy
dreams
cheered
her
lonely
hours
and
anxiety
to
learn
what
might
be
the
condition
of
the
earl
and
countess
so
possessed
her
that
visions
of
affright
now
disturbed
both
her
waking
and
sleeping
senses
fancy
showed
them
in
irons
and
in
a
dungeon
and
sometimes
she
started
in
horror
thinking
that
perhaps
at
that
moment
the
assassin
steel
was
raised
against
the
life
of
her
father
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
when
she
was
chiding
herself
for
such
rebellious
despondence
her
female
attendant
entered
to
say
that
a
friar
was
come
to
conduct
her
where
she
would
see
messengers
from
lady
mar
helen
lingered
not
a
moment
but
giving
her
hand
to
the
good
father
was
led
by
him
into
the
library
where
the
prior
was
standing
between
two
men
in
military
habits
one
wore
english
armor
with
his
visor
closed
the
other
a
knight
was
in
tartans
the
scot
presented
her
with
a
signet
set
in
gold
helen
looked
on
it
and
immediately
recognized
the
same
that
her
stepmother
always
used
the
scottish
knight
was
preparing
to
address
her
when
the
prior
interrupted
him
and
taking
lady
helen
hand
made
her
seat
herself
compose
yourself
for
a
few
minutes
said
he
this
transitory
life
hourly
brings
forward
events
to
teach
us
to
be
calm
and
to
resign
our
wishes
and
our
wills
to
the
lord
of
all
things
helen
looked
fearfully
in
his
face
some
evil
tidings
are
to
be
told
me
the
blood
left
her
lips
it
seemed
leaving
her
heart
also
the
prior
full
of
compassion
hesitated
to
speak
the
scot
abruptly
answered
her
be
not
alarmed
lady
your
parents
have
fallen
into
humane
hands
i
am
sent
under
the
command
of
this
noble
southron
knight
to
conduct
you
to
them
then
my
father
lives
they
are
safe
cried
she
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
bursting
into
tears
he
yet
lives
returned
the
officer
but
his
wounds
opening
afresh
and
the
fatigues
of
his
journey
have
so
exhausted
him
that
lord
aymer
de
valence
has
granted
the
prayers
of
the
countess
and
we
come
to
take
you
to
receive
his
last
blessing
a
cry
of
anguish
burst
from
the
heart
of
lady
helen
and
falling
into
the
arms
of
the
prior
she
found
refuge
from
woe
in
a
merciful
insensibility
the
pitying
exertions
of
the
venerable
father
at
last
recalled
her
to
recollection
and
to
sorrow
she
rose
from
the
bench
on
which
he
had
laid
her
and
begged
permission
to
retire
for
a
few
minutes
tears
choked
her
further
utterance
and
being
led
out
by
the
friar
she
once
more
reentered
her
cell
lady
helen
passed
the
moments
she
had
requested
in
those
duties
which
alone
can
give
comfort
to
the
afflicted
when
all
that
is
visible
bids
us
despair
and
rising
from
her
knees
with
that
holy
fortitude
which
none
but
the
devout
can
know
she
took
her
mantle
and
veil
and
throwing
them
over
her
sent
her
attendant
to
the
prior
to
say
she
was
ready
to
set
out
on
her
journey
and
wished
to
receive
his
parting
benediction
the
venerable
father
followed
by
halbert
obeyed
her
summons
on
seeing
the
poor
old
harper
helen
heart
lost
some
of
its
composure
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
farewell
sweetest
lady
may
the
prayers
of
the
dear
saint
to
whose
remains
your
pious
care
gave
a
holy
grave
draw
down
upon
your
own
head
consolation
and
peace
the
old
man
sobbed
and
the
tears
of
lady
helen
as
he
bent
upon
her
hand
dropped
upon
his
silver
hair
may
heaven
hear
you
good
halbert
and
cease
not
venerable
man
to
pray
for
me
for
i
go
into
the
hour
of
trial
all
that
dwell
in
this
house
my
daughter
rejoined
the
prior
shall
put
up
orisons
for
your
comfort
and
for
the
soul
of
the
departing
earl
observing
that
her
grief
augmented
at
these
words
he
proceeded
in
a
yet
more
soothing
voice
regret
not
that
he
goes
before
you
for
what
is
death
but
entrance
into
life
it
is
the
narrow
gate
which
shuts
us
from
this
dark
world
to
usher
us
into
another
of
everlasting
light
and
happiness
weep
not
then
dear
child
of
the
church
that
your
earthly
parents
precede
you
to
the
heavenly
father
rather
say
with
the
virgin
saint
bride
long
o
lord
am
i
to
be
banished
thy
presence
how
long
endure
the
prison
of
my
body
before
i
am
admitted
to
the
freedom
of
paradise
to
the
bliss
of
thy
saints
above
helen
raised
her
eyes
yet
shining
in
tears
and
with
a
divine
smile
pressing
the
crucifix
to
her
breast
you
do
indeed
arm
me
my
father
this
is
my
strength
and
one
that
will
never
fail
thee
exclaimed
he
she
dropped
upon
one
knee
before
him
he
crossed
his
hands
over
her
head
he
looked
up
to
heaven
his
bosom
heaved
his
lips
moved
then
pausing
a
moment
go
said
he
and
may
the
angels
which
guard
innocence
minister
to
your
sorrows
and
lead
you
into
peace
helen
bowed
and
breathing
inwardly
a
devout
response
rose
and
followed
the
prior
out
of
the
cell
at
the
end
of
the
cloister
she
again
bade
farewell
to
halbert
before
the
great
gates
stood
the
knights
with
their
attendants
she
once
more
kissed
the
crucifix
held
by
the
prior
and
giving
her
hand
to
the
scot
was
placed
by
him
on
a
horse
richly
caparisoned
he
sprung
on
another
himself
while
the
english
officer
who
was
already
mounted
drawing
up
to
her
she
pulled
down
her
veil
and
all
bowing
to
the
holy
brotherhood
at
the
porch
rode
off
at
a
gentle
pace
a
long
stretch
of
wood
which
spread
before
the
monastery
and
screened
the
back
of
bothwell
castle
from
being
discernible
on
that
side
of
the
clyde
lay
before
them
through
this
green
labyrinth
they
pursued
their
way
till
they
crossed
the
river
time
wears
exclaimed
the
scot
to
his
companion
we
must
push
on
the
english
knight
nodded
and
set
his
spurs
into
his
steed
the
whole
troop
now
fell
into
a
rapid
trot
the
banks
of
the
avon
opened
into
a
hundred
beautiful
seclusions
which
intersecting
the
deep
sides
of
the
river
with
umbrageous
shades
and
green
hillocks
seemed
to
shut
it
from
the
world
helen
in
vain
looked
for
the
distant
towers
of
dumbarton
castle
marking
the
horizon
no
horizon
appeared
but
ranges
of
rocks
and
wooded
precipices
a
sweet
breeze
played
through
the
valley
and
revived
her
harassed
frame
she
put
aside
her
veil
to
enjoy
its
freshness
and
saw
that
the
knights
turned
their
horses
heads
into
one
of
the
obscurest
mountain
defiles
she
started
at
its
depth
and
at
the
gloom
which
involved
its
extremity
it
is
our
nearest
path
said
the
scot
helen
made
no
reply
but
turning
her
steed
also
followed
him
there
being
room
for
only
one
at
a
time
to
ride
along
the
narrow
margin
of
the
river
that
flowed
at
its
base
the
englishman
whose
voice
she
had
not
yet
heard
and
his
attendants
followed
likewise
in
file
and
with
difficulty
the
horses
could
make
their
way
through
the
thicket
which
interlaced
the
pathway
so
confined
indeed
that
it
rather
seemed
a
cleft
made
by
an
earthquake
in
the
mountain
than
a
road
for
the
use
of
man
when
they
had
been
employed
for
an
hour
in
breaking
their
way
through
this
trackless
glen
they
came
to
a
wider
space
where
other
and
broader
ravines
opened
before
them
the
scot
taking
a
pass
to
the
right
raised
his
bugle
and
blew
so
sudden
a
blast
that
the
horse
on
which
lady
helen
sat
took
fright
and
began
to
plunge
and
rear
to
the
evident
hazard
of
throwing
her
into
the
stream
some
of
the
dismounted
men
seeing
her
danger
seized
the
horse
by
the
bridle
while
the
english
knight
extricating
her
from
the
saddle
carried
her
through
some
clustering
bushes
into
a
cave
and
laid
her
at
the
feet
of
an
armed
man
terrified
at
this
extraordinary
action
she
started
up
with
a
piercing
shriek
but
was
at
that
moment
enveloped
in
the
arms
of
the
stranger
while
a
loud
shout
of
exhultation
resounded
from
the
scot
who
stood
at
the
entrance
it
was
echoed
from
without
there
was
horror
in
every
sound
blessed
virgin
protect
me
she
cried
striving
to
break
from
the
fierce
grasp
that
held
her
where
am
i
looking
wildly
at
the
two
men
who
had
brought
her
why
am
i
not
taken
to
my
father
she
received
no
answer
and
both
the
scot
and
the
englishman
left
the
place
the
stranger
still
held
her
locked
in
a
gripe
that
seemed
of
iron
in
vain
she
struggled
in
vain
she
shrieked
in
vain
she
called
on
earth
and
heaven
for
assistance
she
was
held
and
still
he
kept
silence
exhausted
with
terror
and
fruitless
attempt
for
release
she
put
her
hands
together
and
in
a
calmer
tone
exclaimed
if
you
have
honor
or
humanity
in
your
heart
release
me
i
am
an
unprotected
woman
praying
for
your
mercy
withhold
it
not
for
the
sake
of
heaven
and
your
own
soul
kneel
to
me
then
thou
siren
cried
the
warrior
with
fierceness
as
he
spoke
he
threw
the
tender
knees
of
lady
helen
upon
the
rocky
floor
his
voice
echoed
terribly
in
her
ears
but
obeying
him
free
me
cried
she
for
the
sake
of
my
dying
father
never
till
i
have
had
my
revenge
at
this
dreadful
denunciation
she
shuddered
to
the
soul
but
yet
she
spoke
surely
i
am
mistaken
for
some
one
else
oh
how
can
i
have
offended
any
man
to
incur
so
cruel
an
outrage
the
warrior
burst
into
a
satanic
laugh
and
throwing
up
his
visor
behold
me
helen
cried
he
grasping
her
clasped
hands
with
a
horrible
force
my
hour
is
come
at
the
sight
of
the
dreadful
face
of
soulis
she
comprehended
all
her
danger
and
with
supernatural
strength
wresting
her
hands
from
his
hold
she
burst
through
the
bushes
out
of
the
cave
her
betrayers
stood
at
the
entrance
and
catching
her
in
their
arms
brought
her
back
to
their
lord
but
it
was
an
insensible
form
they
now
laid
before
him
overcome
with
horror
her
senses
had
fled
short
was
this
suspension
from
misery
water
was
thrown
on
her
face
and
she
awoke
to
recollection
lying
on
the
bosom
of
her
enemy
again
she
struggled
again
her
cries
echoed
from
side
to
side
of
the
cavern
peace
cried
the
monster
you
can
not
escape
you
are
now
mine
forever
twice
you
refused
to
be
my
wife
you
dared
to
despise
my
love
and
my
power
now
you
shall
feel
my
hatred
and
my
revenge
kill
me
cried
the
distracted
helen
kill
me
and
i
will
bless
you
that
would
be
a
poor
vengeance
cried
he
you
must
be
humbled
proud
minion
you
must
learn
to
fawn
on
me
for
a
smile
to
woo
as
my
slave
for
one
of
those
caresses
you
spurned
to
receive
as
my
wife
as
he
spoke
he
strained
her
to
his
breast
with
the
contending
expressions
of
passion
and
revenge
glaring
in
his
eyes
helen
shrieked
at
the
pollution
of
his
lips
and
as
he
more
fiercely
held
her
her
hand
struck
against
the
hilt
of
his
dagger
in
a
moment
she
drew
it
and
armed
with
the
strength
of
outraged
innocence
unwitting
whether
it
gave
death
or
not
only
hoping
it
would
release
her
she
struck
it
into
his
side
all
was
the
action
of
an
instant
while
as
instantaneously
he
caught
her
wrist
and
exclaiming
damnable
traitress
dashed
her
from
him
stunned
and
motionless
to
the
ground
the
weapon
had
not
penetrated
far
but
the
sight
of
his
blood
drawn
by
the
hand
of
a
woman
incensed
the
raging
soulis
he
called
aloud
on
macgregor
the
two
men
who
yet
stood
without
the
cave
they
started
when
they
saw
a
dagger
in
his
hand
and
helen
lying
apparently
lifeless
with
blood
sprinkled
on
her
garments
macgregor
who
had
personated
the
scottish
knight
in
a
tremulous
voice
asked
why
he
had
killed
the
lady
soulis
frowned
here
cried
he
throwing
open
his
vest
this
wound
that
beautiful
fiend
you
so
piteously
look
upon
aimed
at
my
life
my
lord
said
the
other
man
who
had
heard
her
shrieks
i
expected
different
treatment
for
the
earl
of
mar
daughter
base
scot
returned
soulis
when
you
brought
a
woman
into
these
wilds
to
me
you
had
no
right
to
expect
that
i
should
use
her
otherwise
than
as
i
pleased
and
you
as
the
servile
minister
of
my
pleasures
this
language
lord
soulis
rejoined
the
man
much
agitated
but
you
mistook
me
i
meant
not
to
reproach
is
well
you
did
not
and
turning
from
him
with
contempt
he
listened
to
macgregor
who
stooping
toward
the
inanimate
helen
observed
that
her
pulse
beat
fool
returned
soulis
did
you
think
i
would
so
rashly
throw
away
what
i
have
been
at
such
pains
to
gain
call
your
wife
she
knows
how
to
teach
these
minions
submission
to
my
will
the
man
obeyed
and
while
his
companion
by
the
command
of
soulis
bound
a
fillet
round
the
bleeding
forehead
of
helen
cut
by
the
flints
the
chief
brought
two
chains
and
fastening
them
to
her
wrists
and
ankles
exclaimed
with
brutal
triumph
while
he
locked
them
on
there
my
haughty
damsel
flatter
not
thyself
that
the
arms
of
soulis
shall
be
thine
only
fetters
macgregor
wife
entered
and
promised
to
obey
all
her
injunctions
when
she
was
left
alone
with
the
breathless
body
of
helen
water
and
a
few
cordial
drops
which
she
poured
into
the
unhappy
lady
mouth
soon
recalled
her
wretched
senses
on
opening
her
eyes
the
sight
of
one
of
her
own
sex
inspired
her
with
some
hope
but
attempting
to
stretch
out
her
hands
in
supplication
she
was
at
finding
them
fastened
and
at
the
clink
of
the
chains
which
bound
her
why
am
i
thus
demanded
she
of
the
woman
but
suddenly
recollecting
having
attempted
to
pierce
soulis
with
his
own
dagger
and
now
supposing
she
had
slain
him
she
added
is
lord
soulis
killed
no
replied
the
woman
my
husband
says
he
is
but
slightly
hurt
and
surely
your
fair
face
belies
your
heart
if
you
could
intend
the
death
of
so
brave
and
loving
a
lord
you
then
belong
to
him
cried
the
wretched
helen
wringing
her
hands
what
will
be
my
unhappy
fate
virgin
of
heaven
take
me
to
thyself
heaven
forbid
cried
the
woman
that
you
should
pray
against
being
the
favorite
lady
of
our
noble
chief
many
are
the
scores
around
hermitage
castle
who
would
come
hither
on
their
hands
and
knees
to
arrive
at
that
happiness
happiness
cried
lady
helen
in
anguish
of
spirit
it
can
visit
me
no
more
till
i
am
restored
to
my
father
till
i
am
released
from
the
power
of
soulis
give
me
liberty
continued
she
wildly
grasping
the
arm
of
the
woman
assist
me
to
escape
and
half
the
wealth
of
the
earl
of
mar
shall
be
your
reward
alas
returned
the
woman
my
lord
would
burn
me
on
the
spot
and
murder
my
husband
did
he
think
i
even
listened
to
such
a
project
no
lady
you
never
will
see
your
father
more
for
none
who
enter
my
hermitage
ever
wish
to
come
out
again
the
hermitage
cried
helen
in
augmented
horror
oh
father
of
mercy
never
let
me
live
to
enter
those
accursed
walls
they
are
frightful
enough
to
be
sure
returned
the
woman
but
you
gentle
lady
will
be
princess
there
and
in
all
things
commanding
the
kingly
heart
of
its
lord
have
rather
cause
to
bless
than
to
curse
the
castle
of
soulis
himself
and
all
that
bear
his

his

creature
and
if
you
have
a
daughter
whose
honor
is

to
your
prayers
think

my
life
is
in
your

for
i
swear
before
the
throne
of
almighty
purity
that
soulis
shall
see
me
die
rather
than
dishonored
poor
young
soul
cried
the
woman
looking
at
her
frantic
gestures
with
commiseration
i
would
pity
you
if
i
durst
but
i
repeat
my
life
and
my
husband
and
my
children
who
are
now
near
hermitage
would
all
be
sacrificed
to
the
rage
of
lord
soulis
you
must
be
content
to
submit
to
his
will
helen
closed
her
hands
over
her
face
in
mute
despair
and
the
woman
went
on
and
as
for
the
matter
of
your
making
such
lamentations
about
your
father
if
he
be
as
little
your
friend
as
your
mother
is
you
have
not
much
cause
to
grieve
on
that
score
helen
started
my
mother
what
of
her
speak
tell
me
it
is
indeed
her
signet
that
betrayed
me
into
these
horrors
she
can
not
have
consented
oh
no
some
villians
speak
tell
me
what
you
would
say
of
lady
mar
regardless
of
the
terrible
emotion
which
now
shook
the
frame
of
her
auditor
the
woman
coolly
replied
she
had
heard
from
her
husband
who
was
the
confidential
servant
of
lord
soulis
that
it
was
to
lady
mar
he
owed
the
knowledge
of
helen
being
at
bothwell
the
countess
had
written
a
letter
to
her
cousin
lord
buchan
who
being
a
sworn
friend
of
england
she
intimated
with
lord
de
valence
at
dumbarton
in
this
epistle
she
intimated
her
wish
that
lord
buchan
would
devise
a
plan
to
surprise
bothwell
castle
the
ensuing
day
to
prevent
the
departure
of
its
armed
vassals
then
preparing
to
march
to
the
support
of
the
outlaw
sir
william
wallace
who
with
his
band
of
robbers
was
lurking
about
the
caverns
of
the
cartlane
craigs
when
this
letter
arrived
lord
soulis
was
at
dinner
with
the
other
lords
and
buchan
laying
it
before
de
valence
they
all
consulted
what
was
best
to
be
done
lady
mar
begged
her
cousin
not
to
appear
in
the
affair
himself
that
she
might
escape
the
suspicions
of
her
lord
who
she
strongly
declared
was
not
arming
his
vassals
from
any
disloyal
disposition
toward
the
king
of
england
but
solely
at
the
instigations
of
wallace
to
whom
he
romantically
considered
himself
bound
by
the
ties
of
gratitude
as
she
gave
this
information
she
hoped
that
no
attainder
would
fall
upon
her
husband
and
to
keep
the
transaction
as
close
as
possible
she
proposed
that
the
lord
soulis
who
she
understood
was
then
at
dumbarton
should
take
the
command
of
two
or
three
thousand
troops
and
marching
to
bothwell
next
morning
seize
the
few
hundred
armed
scots
who
were
there
ready
to
proceed
to
the
mountains
she
ended
by
saying
that
her
was
in
the
castle
which
she
hoped
would
be
an
inducement
to
soulis
to
insure
the
earl
of
mar
safety
for
the
sake
of
her
hand
as
his
reward
the
greatest
part
of
lady
mar
injunctions
could
not
be
attended
to
as
lord
de
valence
as
well
as
soulis
was
made
privy
to
the
secret
the
english
nobleman
declared
that
he
should
not
do
his
duty
to
his
king
if
he
did
not
head
the
force
that
went
to
quell
so
dangerous
a
conspiracy
and
soulis
eager
to
go
at
any
rate
joyfully
accepted
the
honor
of
being
his
companion
lord
buchan
was
easily
persuaded
to
the
seizure
of
the
earl
person
as
de
valence
flattered
him
that
the
king
would
endow
him
with
the
mar
estates
which
must
now
be
confiscated
helen
groaned
at
the
latter
part
of
the
narrative
but
the
woman
without
noticing
it
proceeded
to
relate
how
when
the
party
had
executed
their
design
at
bothwell
castle
she
was
to
have
been
taken
by
soulis
to
his
castle
near
glasgow
but
on
that
wily
scot
not
finding
her
he
conceived
the
suspicion
that
lord
de
valence
had
prevailed
on
the
countess
to
give
her
up
to
him
he
observed
that
the
woman
who
could
be
induced
to
betray
her
daughter
to
one
man
would
easily
be
bribed
to
repeat
the
crime
to
another
and
under
this
impression
he
accused
the
english
nobleman
of
treachery
de
valence
denied
it
vehemently
so
quarrel
ensued
and
soulis
departed
with
a
few
of
his
followers
giving
out
that
he
was
retiring
in
high
indignation
to
dunglass
but
the
fact
was
he
lurked
about
in
bothwell
wood
and
from
its
recesses
saw
cressingham
lieutenant
march
by
to
take
possession
of
the
castle
in
the
king
name
a
deserter
from
this
troop
fell
in
with
lord
soulis
company
and
flying
to
him
for
protection
a
long
private
conversation
took
place
between
them
at
this
period
one
of
the
spies
who
had
been
left
by
that
chief
in
quest
of
news
returned
with
a
female
tenant
of
fillan
whom
he
had
seduced
from
her
home
she
told
lord
soulis
all
he
wanted
to
know
informing
him
that
a
beautiful
young
lady
who
could
be
no
other
than
lady
helen
mar
was
concealed
in
that
convent
on
this
information
he
conversed
a
long
time
with
the
stranger
from
cressingham
detachment
and
determining
on
carrying
off
helen
immediately
to
hermitage
that
the
distance
of
teviotdale
might
render
a
rescue
less
probable
he
laid
the
plan
accordingly
in
consequence
continued
the
woman
my
husband
and
the
stranger
the
one
habited
as
a
scottish
and
the
other
as
an
english
knight
for
my
lord
being
ever
on
some
wild
prank
has
always
a
chest
of
strange
dresses
with
him
set
out
for
fillan
taking
with
them
the
signet
which
your
mother
had
sent
with
her
letter
to
the
earl
her
cousin
they
hoped
such
a
pledge
of
their
truth
would
insure
them
credit
you
know
the
tale
they
invented
and
its
success
proves
my
lord
to
be
no
bad
contriver
chapter
xiv
the
pentland
hills
helen
listened
with
astonishment
and
grief
to
this
too
probable
story
of
her
tenderness
or
cruel
treachery
and
remembering
the
threats
which
had
escaped
that
lady
in
their
last
conversation
she
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
what
so
clearly
explained
the
before
inexplicable
seizure
of
her
father
the
betraying
of
wallace
and
her
own
present
calamity
you
do
not
answer
me
rejoined
the
woman
but
if
you
think
i
say
true
lord
soulis
himself
will
assure
you
of
the
fact
alas
no
returned
helen
profoundly
sighing
i
believe
it
too
well
i
see
the
depth
of
the
misery
into
which
i
am
plunged
and
yet
cried
she
recollecting
the
imposition
the
men
had
put
upon
her
yet
i
shall
not
be
wholly
so
if
my
father
lives
and
was
not
in
the
extremity
they
told
me
of
if
that
thought
gives
you
comfort
retain
it
returned
the
woman
the
whole
story
of
the
earl
illness
was
an
invention
to
bring
you
at
so
short
notice
from
the
protection
of
the
prior
i
thank
thee
gracious
providence
for
this
comfort
exclaimed
helen
it
inspires
me
with
redoubled
trust
in
thee
margery
shook
her
head
ah
poor
victim
thought
she
how
vain
is
thy
devotion
but
she
had
not
time
to
say
so
for
her
husband
and
the
deserter
from
cressingham
the
cave
helen
afraid
that
it
was
soulis
started
up
the
stranger
proceeded
to
lift
her
in
his
arms
she
struggled
and
in
the
evidence
of
her
action
struck
his
beaver
it
opened
and
discovered
a
pale
and
stern
countenance
with
a
large
scar
across
his
jaw
this
mark
of
contest
and
the
gloomy
scowl
of
his
eyes
made
helen
rush
toward
the
woman
for
protection
the
man
hastily
closed
his
helmet
and
speaking
through
the
clasped
steel
for
the
first
time
she
heard
his
voice
it
sounded
hollow
and
decisive
he
bade
her
prepare
to
accompany
lord
soulis
in
a
journey
to
the
south
helen
looked
at
her
shackled
arms
and
despairing
of
effecting
her
escape
by
any
effort
of
her
own
she
thought
that
gaining
time
might
be
some
advantage
and
allowing
the
man
to
take
her
hand
while
macgregor
supported
her
on
the
other
side
they
led
her
out
of
the
cave
she
observed
the
latter
smiled
significantly
at
his
wife
oh
cried
she
to
what
am
i
betrayed
unhand
me
leave
me
almost
fainting
with
dread
she
leaned
against
the
arm
of
the
stranger
thunder
now
peaked
over
her
head
and
lightning
shot
across
the
mountains
she
looked
up
merciful
heaven
cried
she
in
a
voice
of
deep
horror
send
down
thy
bolt
on
me
at
that
moment
soulis
mounted
on
his
steed
approached
and
ordered
her
to
be
put
into
the
litter
incapable
of
contending
with
the
numbers
which
surrounded
her
she
allowed
them
to
execute
their
master
commands
macgregor
wife
was
set
on
a
pillion
behind
him
and
soulis
giving
the
word
they
all
marched
on
at
a
rapid
pace
in
a
few
hours
having
cleared
the
shady
valleys
of
the
clyde
they
entered
the
long
and
barren
tracts
of
the
leadhill
moors
a
dismal
hue
overspread
the
country
the
thunder
yet
roared
in
distant
peals
and
the
lightning
came
down
in
such
vast
sheets
that
the
carriers
were
often
obliged
to
set
down
their
burden
and
cover
their
eyes
to
regain
their
sight
a
shrill
wind
pierced
the
slight
covering
of
the
litter
and
blowing
it
aside
discovered
the
mist
or
the
gleaming
of
some
wandering
water
as
it
glided
away
over
the
cheerless
waste
all
is
desolation
like
myself
thought
helen
but
neither
the
cold
wind
nor
the
rain
now
drifting
into
her
vehicle
occasioned
her
any
sensation
it
is
only
when
the
mind
is
at
ease
that
the
body
is
delicate
all
within
her
was
too
expectant
of
mental
horrors
to
notice
the
casual
inconveniences
of
season
or
situation
the
cavalcade
with
difficulty
mounted
the
steps
of
a
mountainous
hill
where
the
storm
raged
so
turbulently
that
the
men
who
carried
the
litter
stopped
and
told
their
lord
it
would
be
impossible
to
proceed
in
the
approaching
darkness
they
conjured
him
to
look
at
the
perpendicular
rocks
rendered
indistinct
by
the
gathering
mist
to
observe
the
overwhelming
gusts
of
the
tempest
and
then
judge
whether
they
dare
venture
with
the
litter
on
so
dangerous
a
pathway
made
slippery
by
descending
rain
to
halt
in
such
a
spot
seemed
to
soulis
as
unsafe
as
to
proceed
we
shall
not
be
better
off
answered
he
should
we
attempt
to
return
precipices
lie
on
either
side
and
to
stand
still
would
be
equally
perilous
the
torrents
from
the
heights
increase
so
rapidly
there
is
every
chance
of
our
being
swept
away
should
we
remain
exposed
to
the
stream
helen
looked
at
these
sublime
cascades
with
a
calm
welcome
as
they
poured
from
the
hills
and
flung
their
spray
upon
the
roof
of
her
vehicle
she
hailed
her
release
in
the
death
they
menaced
and
far
from
being
intimidated
at
the
prospect
cast
a
resigned
and
even
wistful
glance
into
the
swelling
lake
beneath
under
whose
waves
she
expected
soon
to
sleep
on
the
remonstrance
of
their
master
the
men
resumed
their
pace
and
after
a
hard
contention
with
the
storm
they
gained
the
summit
of
the
west
side
of
the
mountain
and
were
descending
its
eastern
brow
when
the
shades
of
night
closed
in
upon
them
looking
down
into
the
black
chaos
on
the
brink
of
which
they
must
pass
along
they
once
more
protested
they
could
not
advance
a
foot
until
the
dawn
should
give
them
some
security
at
this
declaration
which
soulis
saw
could
not
now
be
disputed
he
ordered
the
troop
to
halt
under
the
shelter
of
a
projecting
rock
its
huge
arch
overhung
the
ledge
that
formed
the
road
while
the
deep
gulf
at
his
feet
by
the
roaring
of
its
waters
proclaimed
itself
the
receptacle
of
those
cataracts
which
rush
tremendous
from
the
pentland
hills
soulis
dismounted
the
men
set
down
the
litter
and
removed
to
a
distance
as
he
approached
he
opened
one
of
the
curtains
and
throwing
himself
beside
the
exhausted
but
watchful
helen
clasped
his
arms
roughly
about
her
and
exclaimed
sweet
minion
i
must
pillow
on
your
bosom
till
the
morn
awakes
his
brutal
lips
were
again
riveted
to
her
cheek
ten
thousand
strengths
seemed
then
to
heave
him
from
her
heart
and
struggling
with
a
power
that
amazed
even
herself
she
threw
him
from
her
and
holding
him
off
with
her
shackled
arms
her
shrieks
again
pierced
the
heavens
scream
thy
soul
away
poor
foul
exclaimed
soulis
seizing
her
fiercely
in
his
arms
for
thou
art
now
so
surely
mine
that
heaven
itself
can
not
deprive
me
at
that
moment
her
couch
was
shaken
by
a
sudden
shock
and
in
the
next
she
was
covered
with
the
blood
of
soulis
a
stroke
from
an
unseen
arm
had
reached
him
and
starting
on
his
feet
a
fearful
battle
of
swords
took
place
over
the
prostrate
helen
one
of
the
men
out
of
the
numbers
who
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
their
master
fell
dead
on
her
body
while
the
chief
himself
sorely
wounded
and
breathing
revenge
and
blasphemy
was
forced
off
by
the
survivors
where
do
you
carry
me
villians
cried
he
separate
me
not
from
the
vengeance
i
will
yet
hurl
on
that
demon
who
has
robbed
me
of
my
victim
or
ye
shall
die
a
death
more
horrible
than
hell
can
inflict
he
raved
but
more
unheeded
than
the
tempest
terrified
that
the
spirits
of
darkness
were
indeed
their
pursuers
in
spite
of
his
reiterated
threats
the
men
carried
him
to
a
distant
hollow
in
the
rock
and
laid
him
down
now
insensible
from
loss
of
blood
one
or
two
of
the
most
desperate
returned
to
see
what
was
become
of
lady
helen
well
aware
that
if
they
could
regain
her
their
master
would
be
satisfied
but
on
the
reverse
should
she
be
lost
the
whole
troop
knew
their
fate
would
be
some
merciless
punishment
macgregor
and
the
deserter
of
cressingham
were
the
first
who
reached
the
spot
where
the
lady
had
been
left
with
horror
they
found
the
litter
but
not
herself
she
was
gone
but
whether
carried
off
by
the
mysterious
arm
which
had
felled
their
lord
or
she
had
thrown
herself
into
the
foaming
gulf
beneath
they
could
not
determine
they
decided
however
the
latter
should
be
their
report
to
soulis
knowing
that
he
would
rather
believe
the
object
of
his
passions
had
perished
than
that
she
had
escaped
his
toils
almost
stupefied
with
consternation
they
returned
to
repeat
this
tale
to
their
furious
lord
who
on
having
his
wounds
staunched
had
recovered
from
his
swoon
on
hearing
that
the
beautiful
creature
he
had
so
lately
believed
his
own
beyond
the
power
of
fate
that
his
property
as
he
called
her
the
devoted
slave
of
his
will
the
mistress
of
his
destiny
was
lost
to
him
forever
swallowed
up
in
the
whelming
wave
he
became
frantic
there
was
desperation
in
every
word
he
raved
tore
up
the
earth
like
a
wild
beast
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
dashed
the
wife
of
macgregor
from
him
as
she
approached
with
a
fresh
balsam
for
his
wounds
off
scum
of
a
damned
sex
cried
he
where
is
she
whom
i
intrusted
to
thy
care
my
lord
answered
the
affrighted
woman
you
know
best
you
terrified
the
poor
young
creature
you
forced
yourself
into
a
litter
and
can
you
that
i
should
force
you
to
perdition
execrable
witch
cried
he
that
knew
no
better
how
to
prepare
a
slave
to
receive
her
lord
as
he
spoke
he
struck
her
again
but
it
was
with
his
gauntlet
hand
and
the
eyes
of
the
unfortunate
woman
opened
no
more
the
blow
fell
on
her
temple
and
a
motionless
corpse
lay
before
him
my
wife
cried
the
poor
macgregor
putting
his
trembling

oh
my
lord
how
have
i
deserved
this
you
have
slain
her
suppose
i
have
returned
the
chief
with
a
cold
scorn
she
was
old
and
ugly
and
could
you
recover
helen
you
should
cull
hermitage
for
a
substitute
for
this
prating
bedlam
macgregor
made
no
reply
but
feeling
in
his
heart
that
he
who
sows
the
wind
must
reap
the
whirlwind
that
such
were
the
rewards
from
villainy
to
its
vile
instruments
he
could
not
but
say
to
himself
i
have
deserved
it
of
my
god
but
not
of
thee
and
sobbing
over
the
remains
of
his
equally
criminal
wife
by
the
assistance
of
his
comrades
he
removed
her
from
the
now
hated
presence
of
his

the
hut
meanwhile
the
lady
helen
hardly
rational
from
the
horror
and
hope
that
agitated
her
extricated
herself
from
the
dead
body
and
in
her
eagerness
to
escape
would
certainly
have
fallen
over
the
precipice
had
not
the
same
gallant
arm
which
had
covered
her
persecutor
with
wounds
caught
her
as
she
sprung
from
the
litter
fear
not
lady
exclaimed
a
gentle
voice
you
are
under
the
protection
of
a
scottish
knight
there
was
a
kindness
in
the
sound
that
seemed
to
proclaim
the
speaker
to
be
of
her
own
kindred
she
felt
as
if
suddenly
rescued
by
a
brother
and
dropping
her
head
on
his
bosom
a
shower
of
grateful
tears
relieved
her
heart
and
prevented
her
fainting
aware
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
that
the
enemy
might
soon
be
on
him
again
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
with
the
activity
of
a
mountain
deer
crossed
two
rushing
streams
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
even
under
the
foam
of
their
flood
and
then
treading
with
a
light
and
steady
step
an
alpine
bridge
of
one
single
tree
which
arched
the
cataract
below
he
reached
the
opposite
side
where
spreading
his
plaid
upon
the
rock
he
laid
the
trembling
helen
upon
it
then
softly
breathing
his
bugle
in
a
moment
he
was
surrounded
by
a
number
of
men
whose
rough
gratulations
might
have
reawakened
the
alarm
of
helen
had
she
not
still
heard
his
voice
there
was
graciousness
and
sweetness
in
every
tone
and
she
listened
in
calm
expectation
he
directed
the
men
to
take
their
axes
and
cut
away
on
their
side
of
the
fall
the
tree
which
arched
it
it
was
probable
the
villian
he
had
just
assailed
or
his
followers
might
pursue
him
and
he
thought
it
prudent
to
demolish
the
bridge
the
men
obeyed
and
the
warrior
returned
to
his
fair
charge
it
was
raining
fast
and
fearful
of
further
exposing
her
to
the
inclemencies
of
the
night
he
proposed
leading
her
to
shelter
there
is
a
cell
on
the
northern
side
of
this
mountain
i
will
conduct
you
thither
in
the
morning
as
to
the
securest
asylum
but
meanwhile
we
must
seek
a
nearer
refuge
anywhere
sir
with
honor
my
guide
answered
helen
timidly
you
are
safe
with
me
lady
returned
he
as
in
the
arms
of
the
virgin
i
am
a
man
who
can
now
have
no
joy
in
womankind
but
when
as
a
brother
i
protect
them
whoever
you
are
confide
in
me
and
you
shall
not
be
betrayed
helen
confidently
gave
him
her
hand
and
strove
to
rise
but
at
the
first
attempt
the
shackles
piercing
her
ankles
she
sunk
again
on
the
ground
the
cold
iron
on
her
wrists
touched
the
hand
of
her
preserver
he
now
recollected
his
surprise
on
hearing
the
clank
of
chains
when
carrying
her
over
the
bridge
who
inquired
he
could
have
done
this
unmanly
deed
the
wretch
from
whom
you
rescued
me
to
prevent
my
escape
from
a
captivity
worse
than
death
while
she
spoke
he
wrenched
open
the
manacles
from
her
wrists
and
ankles
and
threw
them
over
the
precipice
as
she
heard
them
dash
into
the
torrent
an
unutterable
gratitude
filled
her
heart
and
again
giving
her
hand
to
him
to
lead
her
forward
she
said
with
earnestness
o
sir
if
you
have
a
wife
or
sister
should
they
ever
fall
into
the
like
peril
with
mine
for
in
these
terrific
times
who
is
secure
may
heaven
reward
your
bravery
by
sending
them
such
a
preserver
the
stranger
sighed
deeply
sweet
lady
returned
he
i
have
no
sister
no
wife
but
my
kindred
is
nevertheless
very
numerous
and
i
thank
thee
for
thy
prayer
the
hero
sighed
profoundly
again
and
led
her
silently
down
the
windings
of
the
declivity
having
proceeded
with
caution
they
descended
into
a
little
wooded
dell
and
soon
approached
the
remains
of
what
had
once
been
a
shepherd
hut
this
said
the
knight
as
they
entered
was
the
habitation
of
a
good
old
man
who
fed
his
flock
on
these
mountains
but
a
band
of
southron
soldiers
forced
his
only
daughter
from
him
and
plundering
his
little
abode
drove
him
out
upon
the
waste
he
perished
the
same
night
by
grief
and
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
his
son
a
brave
youth
was
left
for
dead
by
his
sister
ravishers
but
i
found
him
in
this
dreary
solitude
and
he
told
me
the
too
general
story
of
his
wounds
and
his
despair
indeed
lady
when
i
heard
your
shrieks
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
chasm
i
thought
they
might
proceed
from
this
poor
sister
and
i
flew
to
restore
them
to
each
other
helen
shuddered
as
he
related
a
tale
so
near
resembling
her
own
and
trembling
with
weakness
and
horror
of
what
might
have
been
her
fate
had
she
not
been
rescued
by
this
gallant
stranger
she
sunk
exhausted
upon
a
turf
seat
the
chief
still
held
her
hand
it
was
very
cold
and
he
called
to
his
men
to
seek
fuel
to
make
a
fire
while
his
messengers
were
exploring
the
crannies
of
the
rocks
for
dried
leaves
and
sticks
helen
totally
overcome
leaned
almost
motionless
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
finding
by
her
shortened
breath
that
she
was
fainting
the
knight
took
her
in
his
arms
and
supporting
her
on
his
breast
chafed
her
hands
and
her
forehead
his
efforts
were
in
vain
she
seemed
to
have
ceased
to
breathe
hardly
a
pulse
moved
her
heart
alarmed
at
such
signs
of
death
he
spoke
to
one
of
his
men
who
remained
in
the
hut
the
man
answered
his
master
inquiry
by
putting
a
flash
into
his
hand
the
knight
poured
some
of
its
contents
into
her
mouth
her
streaming
locks
wetted
his
cheek
poor
lady
said
he
she
will
perish
in
these
forlorn
regions
where
neither
warmth
nor
nourishment
can
be
found
to
his
glad
welcome
several
of
his
men
soon
after
entered
with
a
quantity
of
withered
boughs
which
they
had
found
in
the
fissures
of
the
rock
at
some
distance
with
these
a
fire
was
speedily
kindled
and
its
blaze
diffusing
comfort
through
the
chamber
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
a
sigh
from
the
breast
of
his
charge
her
head
still
leaned
on
his
bosom
when
she
opened
her
eyes
the
light
shone
full
on
her
face
lady
said
he
i
bless
god
you
are
revived
her
delicacy
shrunk
at
the
situation
in
which
she
found
herself
and
raising
herself
though
feebly
she
thanked
him
and
requested
a
little
water
it
was
given
to
her
she
drank
some
and
would
have
met
the
fixed
and
compassionate
gaze
of
the
knight
had
not
weakness
cast
such
a
film
before
her
eyes
that
she
scarcely
saw
anything
being
still
languid
she
leaned
her
head
on
the
turf
seat
her
face
was
pale
as
marble
and
her
long
hair
saturated
with
wet
by
its
darkness
made
her
look
of
a
more
deadly
hue
death
how
lovely
canst
thou
be
sighed
the
knight
to
himself
he
even
groaned
helen
started
and
looked
around
her
with
alarm
fear
not
said
he
i
only
dreaded
your
pale
looks
but
you
revive
and
will
yet
bless
all
that
are
dear
to
you
suffer
me
sweet
lady
to
drain
the
dangerous
wet
from
these
tresses
he
took
hold
of
them
as
he
spoke
she
saw
the
water
running
from
her
hair
over
his
hands
and
allowing
his
kind
request
he
continued
wiping
her
glossy
locks
with
his
scarf
till
exhausted
by
fatigue
she
gradually
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
dawn
had
penetrated
the
ruined
walls
of
the
hut
before
lady
helen
awoke
but
when
she
did
she
was
refreshed
and
opening
her
eyes
hardly
conscious
where
she
was
or
whether
all
that
floated
in
her
memory
were
not
the
departing
vapors
of
a
frightful
dream
she
turned
her
head
and
fixed
them
upon
the
figure
of
the
knight
who
was
seated
near
her
his
noble
air
and
the
pensive
expression
of
his
fine
features
struck
like
a
spell
upon
her
gathering
recollections
she
at
once
remembered
all
she
had
suffered
all
that
she
owed
to
him
she
moved
her
preserver
turned
his
eyes
toward
her
seeing
she
was
awake
he
rose
from
the
side
of
the
dying
embers
he
had
sedulously
kept
alive
during
her
slumber
and
expressed
his
hopes
that
she
felt
restored
she
returned
him
a
grateful
reply
in
the
affirmative
and
he
quitted
her
to
rouse
his
men
for
their
journey
to
the
hermit
cell
when
he
he
found
helen
braiding
up
the
fine
hair
which
had
so
lately
been
scattered
by
the
elements
she
would
have
risen
at
his
approach
but
he
seated
himself
on
a
stone
at
her
feet
we
shall
be
detained
here
a
few
minutes
longer
said
he
i
have
ordered
my
men
to
make
a
litter
of
crossed
branches
to
bear
you
on
their
shoulders
your
delicate
limbs
would
not
be
equal
to
the
toil
of
descending
these
heights
to
the
glen
of
stones
the
venerable
man
who
inhabits
there
will
protect
you
until
he
can
summon
your
family
or
friends
to
receive
his
charge
at
these
words
which
helen
thought
were
meant
to
reprove
her
for
not
having
revealed
herself
she
blushed
but
fearful
of
breathing
a
name
under
the
interdict
of
the
english
governors
and
which
had
already
spread
devastation
over
all
with
whom
it
had
been
connected
fearful
of
involving
her
preserver
safety
by
making
him
aware
of
the
persecuted
creature
he
had
rescued
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
with
the
color
heightening
on
her
cheeks
replied
for
your
humanity
brave
sir
shown
this
night
to
a
friendless
woman
i
must
be
ever
grateful
but
not
even
to
the
hermit
may
i
reveal
my
name
it
is
fraught
with
danger
to
every
honest
scot
who
should
know
that
he
protects
one
who
bears
it
and
therefore
least
of
all
noble
stranger
would
i
breathe
it
to
you
she
averted
her
face
to
conceal
the
emotions
she
could
not
subdue
the
knight
looked
at
her
intensely
and
profoundly
sighed
half
her
unbraided
locks
lay
upon
her
bosom
which
now
heaved
with
suppressed
feelings
and
the
tears
gliding
through
her
long
eyelashes
dropped
upon
his
hand
he
sighed
again
and
tore
his
eyes
from
her
countenance
i
ask
not
madam
to
know
what
you
think
proper
to
conceal
but
danger
has
no
alarms
for
me
when
by
incurring
it
i
serve
those
who
need
a
protector
a
sudden
thought
flashed
across
her
mind
might
it
not
be
possible
that
this
tender
guardian
of
her
safety
this
heroic
profferer
of
service
was
the
noble
wallace
but
the
vain
idea
fled
he
was
pent
up
amidst
the
beleaguered
defiles
of
cartland
craigs
sworn
to
extricate
the
helpless
families
of
his
followers
or
to
perish
with
them
this
knight
was
accompanied
by
none
but
men
and
his
kind
eyes
shone
in
too
serene
a
luster
to
be
the
mirrors
of
the
disturbed
soul
of
the
suffering
chief
of
ellerslie
ah
then
murmured
she
to
herself
are
there
two
men
in
scotland
who
will
speak
thus
she
looked
up
in
his
face
the
plumes
of
his
bonnet
shaded
his
features
but
she
saw
they
were
paler
than
on
his
entrance
and
a
strange
expression
of
distraction
agitated
their
before
composed
lines
his
eyes
were
bent
to
the
ground
as
he
proceeded
i
am
the
servant
of
my
command
me
and
my
few
faithful
followers
and
if
it
be
in
the
power
of
such
small
means
to
succor
you
or
yours
i
am
ready
to
answer
for
their
obedience
if
the
villain
from
whom
i
had
the
happiness
to
release
you
be
yet
more
deeply
implicated
in
your
sorrows
tell
me
how
they
can
be
relieved
and
i
will
attempt
it
i
shall
make
no
new
enemies
by
the
deed
for
the
southrons
and
i
are
at
eternal
enmity
helen
could
not
withdraw
her
eyes
from
his
varying
countenance
which
from
underneath
his
dark
plumes
seemed
like
a
portentous
cloud
at
intervals
to
emit
the
rays
of
the
cheering
sun
or
the
lightning
of
threatening
thunder
alas
replied
she
ill
should
i
repay
such
nobleness
were
i
to
involve
it
in
the
calamities
of
my
house
no
generous
stranger
i
must
remain
unknown
leave
me
with
the
hermit
and
from
his
cell
i
will
send
to
some
relation
to
take
me
thence
i
urge
you
no
more
gentle
lady
replied
the
knight
rising
were
i
at
the
head
of
an
army
instead
of
a
handful
of
men
i
might
then
have
a
better
argument
for
offering
my
services
but
as
it
is
i
feel
my
weakness
and
seek
to
know
no
further
helen
trembled
with
unaccountable
emotion
were
you
at
the
head
of
an
army
i
might
then
dare
to
reveal
the
full
weight
of
my
anxieties
but
heaven
has
already
been
sufficiently
gracious
to
me
by
your
hands
in
redeeming
me
from
my
cruelest
enemy
and
for
the
rest
i
put
my
trust
in
the
same
overruling
providence
at
this
moment
a
man
entered
and
told
the
knight
the
vehicle
was
finished
the
morning
fine
and
his
men
ready
to
march
he
turned
toward
helen
may
i
conduct
you
to
the
rude
carriage
we
have
prepared
helen
gathered
her
mantle
about
her
and
the
knight
throwing
his
scarf
over
her
head
it
had
no
other
covering
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
led
her
out
on
the
hut
to
the
side
of
the
bier
it
was
overlaid
with
the
men
plaids
the
knight
placed
her
on
it
and
the
carriers
raising
it
on
their
shoulders
her
deliverer
led
the
way
and
they
took
their
course
down
the
mountain
chapter
xvi
the
glen
of
stones
they
proceeded
in
silence
through
the
curvings
of
the
dell
till
it
opened
into
a
hazardous
path
along
the
top
of
a
cliff
which
overhung
and
clasped
in
the
western
side
of
a
deep
loch
as
they
mounted
the
pending
wall
of
this
immense
amphitheater
helen
watched
the
sublime
uprise
of
the
king
of
light
issuing
from
behind
the
opposite
citadel
of
rocks
and
borne
aloft
on
a
throne
of
clouds
that
swam
in
floating
gold
the
herbage
on
the
cliffs
glittered
with
liquid
emeralds
as
his
beams
kissed
their
summits
and
the
lake
beneath
sparkled
like
a
sea
of
molten
diamonds
all
nature
seemed
to
rejoice
at
the
presence
of
this
magnificent
emblem
of
the
most
high
heart
swelled
with
devotion
and
its
sacred
voice
breathed
from
her
lips
such
thought
she
o
sun
art
thou
the
resplendent
image
of
the
giver
of
all
good
thy
cheering
beams
like
his
spirit
pervade
the
soul
and
drive
thence
the
despondency
of
cold
and
darkness
but
bright
as
thou
art
how
does
the
similitude
fade
before
godlike
man
the
true
image
of
his
maker
how
far
do
his
protecting
arms
extend
over
the
desolate
how
mighty
is
the
power
of
his
benevolence
to
dispense
succor
to
administer
consolation
as
she
thus
mused
her
eyes
fell
on
the
noble
mien
of
the
knight
who
with
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
wrapped
in
his
dark
mantle
of
mingled
greens
led
the
way
with
a
graceful
but
rapid
step
along
the
shelving
declivity
turning
suddenly
to
the
left
he
struck
into
a
defile
between
two
prodigious
craggy
mountains
whose
brown
cheeks
trickling
with
ten
thousand
mountains
whose
brown
cheeks
trickling
with
ten
thousand
rills
seemed
to
weep
over
the
deep
gloom
of
the
valley
beneath
scattered
fragments
of
rock
from
the
cliffs
above
covered
with
their
huge
and
almost
impassable
masses
the
surface
of
the
ground
not
an
herb
was
to
be
seen
all
was
black
barren
and
terrific
on
entering
this
horrid
pass
helen
would
have
shuddered
had
she
not
placed
implicit
confidence
in
her
conductor
as
they
advanced
the
vale
gradually
narrowed
and
at
last
shut
them
within
an
immense
chasm
which
seemed
to
have
been
cleft
at
its
towering
summit
to
admit
a
few
beams
of
light
to
the
desert
below
a
dark
river
flowed
along
amid
which
the
bases
of
the
mountains
showed
their
union
by
the
mingling
of
many
a
rugged
cliff
projecting
upward
in
a
variety
of
strange
and
hideous
forms
the
men
who
carried
helen
with
some
difficulty
found
a
safe
footing
however
after
frequent
rests
and
unremitted
caution
they
at
last
extricated
themselves
from
the
most
intricate
path
and
more
lightly
followed
their
chief
into
a
less
gloomy
part
of
this
chaos
of
nature
the
knight
stopped
and
approaching
the
bier
told
helen
they
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
their
journey
in
the
heart
of
that
cliff
said
he
is
the
hermit
cell
a
desolate
shelter
but
a
safe
one
old
age
and
poverty
hold
no
temptations
to
the
enemies
of
scotland
as
he
spoke
the
venerable
man
who
had
heard
voices
beneath
appeared
on
the
rock
and
while
his
tall
and
majestic
figure
clad
in
gray
moved
forward
and
his
silver
beard
flowed
from
his
saintly
countenance
upon
the
air
he
seemed
the
bard
of
morven
issuing
from
his
cave
of
shells
to
bid
a
hero
welcome
to
the
young
and
warlike
oscar
bless
thee
my
son
cried
he
as
he
descended
what
good
or
evil
accident
hath
returned
thee
so
soon
to
these
solitudes
the
knight
briefly
related
the
circumstances
of
helen
rescue
and
that
he
had
brought
her
to
share
his
asylum
the
hermit
took
her
by
the
hand
and
graciously
promised
her
every
service
in
his
power
he
then
preceded
the
knight
whose
firmer
arm
supported
her
up
the
rock
to
the
outer
apartment
of
the
cell
a
sacred
awe
struck
her
as
she
entered
this
place
dedicated
wholly
to
god
she
bowed
and
crossed
herself
the
hermit
observing
her
devotion
blessed
her
and
bade
her
welcome
to
the
abode
of
peace
here
daughter
said
he
has
one
son
of
persecuted
scotland
found
a
refuge
there
is
naught
alluring
in
these
wilds
to
attract
the
spoiler
the
green
herb
is
all
the
food
they
afford
and
the
limpid
water
their
best
beverage
ah
returned
helen
with
grateful
animation
would
to
heaven
that
all
who
love
the
freedom
of
scotland
were
now
within
this
glen
the
herb
and
the
stream
would
be
luxuries
when
tasted
in
liberty
and
hope
my
father
his
she
stopped
recollecting
that
she
had
almost
betrayed
the
secrecy
she
meant
to
maintain
and
looking
down
remained
in
confused
silence
the
knight
gazed
at
her
and
much
wished
to
penetrate
what
she
concealed
but
delicacy
forbade
him
to
urge
her
again
he
spoke
not
but
the
hermit
ignorant
of
her
reluctance
to
reveal
her
family
resumed
i
do
not
wonder
gentle
lady
that
you
speak
in
terms
which
tell
me
even
your
tender
sex
feels
the
tyranny
of
edward
who
in
scotland
is
exempt
the
whole
country
groans
beneath
his
oppressions
and
the
cruelty
of
his
agents
makes
its
rivulets
run
with
blood
six
months
ago
i
was
abbot
of
scone
because
i
refused
to
betray
my
trust
and
resign
the
archives
of
the
kingdom
lodged
there
edward
the
rebel
anointed
of
the
lord
the
profaner
of
the
sanctuary
sent
his
emissaries
to
sack
the
convent
to
tear
the
holy
pillow
of
jacob
from
its
shrine
and
to
wrest
from
my
grasp
the
records
i
refused
to
deliver
all
was
done
as
the
usurper
commanded
most
of
my
brethren
were
slain
myself
and
the
remainder
were
turned
out
upon
the
waste
we
retired
to
the
monastery
of
cambuskenneth
but
there
oppression
found
us
cressingham
having
seized
on
other
religious
houses
determined
to
swell
his
hoards
with
the
plunder
of
that
also
in
the
dead
of
night
the
attack
was
made
my
brethren
fled
i
knew
not
whither
to
go
but
determined
to
fly
far
from
the
tracts
of
our
ravagers
i
took
my
course
over
the
hills
and
finding
the
valley
of
stones
fit
for
my
purpose
for
two
months
have
lived
alone
in
this
wilderness
unhappy
scotland
ejaculated
helen
her
eyes
had
followed
the
chief
who
during
this
narrative
leaned
thoughtfully
against
the
entrance
of
the
cave
his
eyes
were
cast
upward
with
an
expression
that
made
her
heart
utter
the
exclamation
which
had
escaped
her
the
knight
turned
and
approached
her
you
hear
from
the
lips
of
my
venerable
friend
said
he
a
direful
story
happy
then
am
i
gentle
lady
that
you
and
he
have
found
a
refuge
though
a
rough
one
i
must
now
tear
myself
from
this
tranquillity
to
seek
scenes
more
befitting
a
younger
son
of
the
country
he
deplores
helen
felt
unable
to
answer
but
the
abbot
spoke
and
am
i
not
to
see
you
again
that
is
as
heaven
wills
replied
he
but
as
it
is
unlikely
on
this
side
the
grave
my
best
pledge
of
friendship
is
this
lady
to
you
she
may
reveal
what
she
had
withheld
from
me
but
in
either
case
she
is
secure
in
your
goodness
rely
on
my
faith
my
son
and
may
the
almighty
shield
hang
on
your
steps
the
knight
turned
to
helen
farewell
sweet
lady
said
he
she
trembled
at
the
words
and
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
did
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
took
it
and
drew
it
toward
his
lips
but
checking
himself
he
only
pressed
it
while
in
a
mournful
voice
he
added
in
your
prayer
sometimes
remember
the
most
desolate
of
men
a
mist
seemed
to
pass
over
the
eyes
of
lady
helen
she
felt
as
if
on
the
point
of
losing
something
most
precious
to
her
my
prayers
for
my
own
preserver
and
for
my
father
cried
she
in
an
agitated
voice
shall
ever
be
mingled
and
if
ever
it
be
safe
to
remember
me
should
heaven
indeed
arm
the
patriot
hand
then
my
father
may
be
proud
to
know
and
to
thank
the
brave
deliverer
of
his
child
the
knight
paused
and
looked
with
animation
upon
her
then
your
father
is
in
arms
and
against
the
tyrant
tell
me
where
and
you
see
before
you
a
man
who
is
ready
to
join
him
and
to
lay
down
his
life
in
the
just
cause
at
this
vehement
declaration
lady
helen
full
heart
overflowed
and
she
burst
into
tears
he
drew
toward
her
and
in
a
moderated
voice
continued
my
men
though
few
are
brave
they
are
devoted
to
their
country
and
are
willing
for
her
sake
to
follow
me
to
victory
or
to
death
as
i
am
a
knight
i
am
sworn
to
defend
the
cause
of
right
and
where
shall
i
so
justly
find
it
as
on
the
side
of
bleeding
wasted
scotland
how
shall
i
so
well
pursue
my
career
as
in
the
defense
of
her
injured
sons
speak
gentle
lady
trust
me
with
your
noble
father
name
and
he
shall
not
have
cause
to
blame
the
confidence
you
repose
in
a
true
though
wandering
scot
my
father
replied
helen
weeping
afresh
is
not
where
your
generous
services
can
reach
him
two
brave
chiefs
one
a
kinsman
of
my
own
and
the
other
his
friend
are
now
colleagued
to
free
him
if
they
fail
my
whole
house
falls
in
blood
and
to
add
another
victim
to
the
destiny
which
in
that
case
will
overwhelm
me
the
thought
is
beyond
my
strength
faint
with
agitation
and
the
horrible
images
which
reawakened
her
direst
fears
she
stopped
and
then
added
in
a
suppressed
voice
farewell
not
till
you
hear
me
further
replied
he
i
repeat
i
have
now
a
scanty
number
of
followers
but
i
leave
these
mountains
to
gather
more
tell
me
then
where
i
may
join
these
chiefs
you
speak
of
give
me
a
pledge
that
i
come
from
you
and
whoever
may
be
your
father
as
he
is
a
true
scot
i
will
compass
his
release
or
perish
in
the
attempt
alas
generous
stranger
cried
she
to
what
would
you
persuade
me
you
know
not
the
peril
that
you
seek
nothing
is
perilous
to
me
replied
he
with
an
heroic
smile
that
is
to
serve
my
country
i
have
no
interest
no
joy
but
in
her
give
me
then
the
only
happiness
of
which
i
am
now
capable
and
send
me
to
serve
her
by
freeing
one
of
her
defenders
helen
hesitated
the
tumult
of
her
mind
dried
her
tears
she
looked
up
with
all
these
inward
agitations
painted
on
her
cheeks
his
beaming
eyes
were
full
of
patriotic
ardor
and
his
fine
countenance
composed
into
a
heavenly
calmness
by
the
sublime
sentiments
which
occupied
his
soul
made
him
appear
to
her
not
a
as
man
but
as
an
angel
from
the
armed
host
of
heaven
fear
not
lady
said
the
hermit
that
you
would
plunge
your
deliverer
into
any
extraordinary
danger
by
involving
him
in
what
you
might
call
rebellion
against
the
usurper
he
is
already
a
proscribed
man
proscribed
repeated
she
wretched
indeed
is
my
country
when
her
noblest
spirits
are
denied
the
right
to
live
every
step
they
take
to
regain
what
has
been
torn
from
them
only
involves
them
in
deeper
ruin
no
country
is
wretched
sweet
lady
returned
the
knight
till
by
a
dastardly
acquiescence
it
consents
to
its
own
slavery
bonds
and
death
are
the
utmost
of
our
enemy
malice
the
one
is
beyond
his
power
to
inflict
when
a
man
is
determined
to
die
or
to
live
free
and
for
the
other
which
of
us
will
think
that
ruin
which
leads
to
the
blessed
freedom
of
paradise
helen
looked
on
the
chief
as
she
used
to
look
on
her
cousin
when
expressions
of
virtuous
enthusiasm
burst
from
his
lips
but
now
it
was
rather
with
the
gaze
of
admiring
awe
than
the
exhultation
of
one
youthful
mind
sympathizing
with
another
you
would
teach
confidence
to
despair
herself
returned
she
again
i
hope
for
god
does
not
create
in
vain
you
shall
know
every
danger
with
which
that
knowledge
is
surrounded
he
is
hemmed
in
by
enemies
alas
how
closely
are
they
connected
with
him
not
the
english
only
but
the
most
powerful
of
his
countrymen
are
leagues
against
him
they
sold
my
father
to
captivity
and
perhaps
to
death
and
i
wretched
i
was
the
price
to
free
him
the
noblest
of
scottish
knights
is
now
engaged
but
such
hosts
impede
him
that
hope
hardly
dares
hover
over
his
tremendous
path
then
cried
the
stranger
let
my
arm
be
second
to
his
in
the
great
achievement
my
heart
yearns
to
meet
a
brother
in
arms
who
feels
for
scotland
what
i
do
and
with
such
a
coadjutor
i
dare
promise
your
father
liberty
and
that
the
power
of
england
shall
be
shaken
helen
heart
beat
violently
at
these
words
i
would
not
defer
the
union
of
two
such
minds
go
then
to
the
cartlane
craigs
but
alas
how
can
i
direct
you
cried
she
the
passes
are
beset
with
english
and
i
know
not
whether
at
this
moment
the
brave
wallace
survives
to
be
again
the
deliverer
of
my
father
helen
paused
the
recollection
of
all
that
wallace
had
suffered
for
the
sake
of
her
father
and
of
the
mortal
extremity
in
which
ker
had
left
him
rose
like
a
dreadful
train
of
apparitions
before
her
a
pale
horror
overspread
her
countenance
and
lost
in
these
remembrances
she
did
not
remark
the
start
and
rushing
color
of
the
knight
as
she
pronounced
the
name
of
wallace
if
wallace
ever
had
the
happiness
of
serving
any
who
belonged
to
you
returned
the
knight
he
has
at
least
one
source
of
pleasure
in
that
remembrance
tell
me
what
he
can
further
do
only
say
where
is
that
father
whom
you
say
he
once
preserved
and
i
will
hasten
to
yield
my
feeble
aid
to
repeat
the
service
alas
replied
helen
i
can
not
but
repeat
my
fears
that
the
bravest
of
men
no
longer
exists
two
days
before
i
was
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
the
traitor
from
whom
you
rescued
me
a
messenger
from
cartlane
craigs
informed
my
cousin
that
the
gallant
wallace
was
surrounded
and
if
my
father
did
not
send
forces
to
relieve
him
he
must
inevitably
perish
no
forces
could
my
father
send
he
was
then
made
a
prisoner
by
the
english
his
retainers
shared
the
same
fate
and
none
but
my
cousin
escaped
to
accompany
the
honest
scotch
back
to
his
master
my
cousin
set
forth
with
a
few
followers
to
join
him
a
few
against
thousands
they
are
in
arms
for
their
country
lady
returned
the
knight
and
a
thousand
invisible
angels
guard
them
fear
not
for
them
but
for
your
father
name
to
me
the
place
of
his
confinement
and
as
i
have
not
the
besiegers
of
cartlane
craigs
to
encounter
i
engage
with
god
help
and
the
arms
of
my
men
who
never
yet
shrunk
from
sword
or
spear
to
set
the
brave
earl
free
how
exclaimed
helen
remembering
that
she
had
not
yet
mentioned
her
father
rank
and
gazing
at
him
with
astonishment
do
you
know
his
name
is
the
misfortune
of
my
father
already
so
far
spread
rather
say
his
virtue
lady
answered
the
knight
no
man
who
watches
over
the
destiny
of
our
devoted
country
can
be
ignorant
of
her
friends
or
of
the
sufferers
who
bear
injury
for
her
sake
i
know
that
the
earl
of
mar
has
made
himself
a
generous
sacrifice
but
i
am
yet
to
learn
the
circumstances
from
you
speak
without
reserve
that
i
may
seek
the
accomplishment
of
my
vow
and
restore
to
scotland
its
best
friend
thou
brother
in
heart
to
the
generous
wallace
exclaimed
lady
helen
my
voice
is
too
feeble
to
thank
thee
the
hermit
who
had
listened
in
silent
interest
now
fearing
the
consequence
of
so
much
emotion
presented
her
with
a
cup
of
water
and
a
little
fruit
to
refresh
herself
before
she
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
the
knight
she
put
the
cup
to
her
lips
to
gratify
the
benevolence
of
her
host
but
her
anxious
spirit
was
too
much
occupied
in
the
concerns
dearest
to
her
heart
to
feel
any
wants
of
the
body
and
turning
to
the
knight
she
briefly
related
what
had
been
the
design
of
her
father
with
regard
to
sir
william
wallace
how
he
had
been
seized
at
bothwell
and
sent
with
his
family
a
prisoner
to
dumbarton
castle
proceed
then
thither
continued
she
if
heaven
have
yet
spared
the
lives
of
wallace
and
my
cousin
andrew
murray
you
will
meet
them
before
its
walls
meanwhile
i
shall
seek
the
protection
of
my
sister
and
in
her
castle
near
the
forth
abide
in
safety
but
noble
stranger
one
bond
i
must
lay
upon
you
should
you
come
up
with
my
cousin
do
not
discover
that
you
have
met
with
me
he
is
precipitate
in
resentment
and
his
hatred
is
so
hot
against
soulis
my
betrayer
that
should
he
know
the
outrage
i
have
sustained
he
would
i
fear
run
himself
and
the
general
cause
into
danger
by
seeking
an
immediate
revenge
the
stranger
readily
passed
his
word
to
helen
that
he
would
never
mention
her
name
to
any
of
her
family
until
she
herself
should
give
him
leave
but
when
your
father
is
restored
to
his
rights
continued
he
in
his
presence
i
hope
to
claim
my
acquaintance
with
his
admirable
daughter
helen
blushed
at
this
compliment
it
was
not
more
than
any
man
in
his
situation
might
have
said
but
it
confused
her
and
hardly
knowing
what
were
her
thoughts
she
his
personal
freedom
may
be
effected
and
god
grant
such
a
regard
to
your
prowess
but
his
other
rights
what
can
recover
them
his
estates
sequestrated
his
vassals
in
bonds
all
power
of
the
earl
of
mar
will
be
annihilated
and
from
some
obscure
refuge
like
this
must
he
utter
his
thanks
to
his
daughter
preserver
not
so
lady
replied
he
the
sword
is
now
raised
in
scotland
that
can
not
be
laid
down
till
it
be
broken
or
has
conquered
all
have
suffered
by
edward
the
powerful
banished
into
other
countries
that
their
wealth
might
reward
foreign
mercenaries
the
poor
driven
into
the
waste
that
the
meanest
southron
might
share
the
spoil
where
all
have
suffered
all
must
be
ready
to
avenge
and
when
a
whole
people
take
up
arms
to
regain
their
rights
what
force
can
prevent
restitution
god
is
with
them
so
i
felt
returned
helen
while
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
horrors
of
the
contest
while
my
father
commanded
in
bothwell
castle
and
was
sending
out
auxiliaries
to
the
patriot
chief
i
too
felt
nothing
but
the
inspiration
which
led
them
on
and
saw
nothing
but
the
victory
which
must
crown
so
just
a
cause
but
now
when
all
whom
my
father
commanded
are
slain
or
carried
away
by
the
enemy
when
he
is
himself
a
prisoner
and
awaiting
the
sentence
of
the
tyrant
he
opposed
when
the
gallant
wallace
instead
of
being
able
to
hasten
to
his
rescue
is
besieged
by
a
numberless
host
hope
almost
dies
within
me
and
i
fear
that
whoever
may
be
fated
to
free
scotland
my
beloved
father
and
those
belonging
to
him
are
first
to
be
made
a
sacrifice
she
turned
pale
as
she
spoke
and
the
stranger
resumed
no
lady
if
there
be
that
virtue
in
scotland
which
can
alone
deserve
freedom
it
will
be
achieved
i
am
an
inconsiderable
man
but
relying
on
the
god
of
justice
i
promise
you
your
father
liberty
and
let
his
freedom
be
a
pledge
to
you
for
that
of
your
country
i
now
go
to
rouse
a
few
brave
spirits
to
arms
remember
the
battle
is
not
to
the
strong
nor
victory
with
a
multitude
of
hosts
the
of
andrew
was
once
held
from
the
heavens
over
a
little
band
of
scots
while
they
discomfited
a
thousand
enemies
the
same
arm
leads
me
on
and
if
need
be
i
despair
not
to
see
it
again
like
the
flaming
pillar
before
the
israelites
consuming
the
enemies
of
liberty
even
in
the
fullness
of
their
might
a
time
when
achaius
king
of
scotts
and
hungus
king
of
picts
were
fiercely
driven
by
athelstan
king
of
northumberland
into
east
lothian
full
of
terrors
of
what
the
next
morning
might
bring
forth
hungus
fell
into
a
sleep
and
beheld
a
vision
which
tradition
tells
was
verified
the
ensuing
day
by
the
appearance
of
the
cross
of
andrew
held
out
to
him
from
the
heavens
and
waving
him
to
victory
under
this
banner
he
conquered
the
northumberland
forces
and
slaying
their
leader
the
scene
of
the
battle
has
henceforth
been
called
while
he
yet
spoke
the
hermit
from
the
inner
cell
supporting
a
youth
on
his
arm
at
sight
of
the
knight
who
held
out
his
hand
to
him
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
burst
into
tears
do
you
then
leave
me
cried
he
am
i
not
to
serve
my
preserver
helen
rose
in
strange
surprise
there
was
something
in
the
feelings
of
the
boy
that
was
infectious
and
while
her
own
heart
beat
violently
she
looked
first
on
his
emaciated
figure
and
then
at
the
noble
contour
of
the
knight
where
every
god
had
seemed
to
set
his
seal
his
beaming
eyes
appeared
the
very
fountains
of
consolation
his
cheek
was
bright
with
generous
emotions
and
turning
from
the
supplant
boy
to
helen
rise
said
he
to
the
youth
and
behold
in
this
lady
the
object
of
the
service
to
which
i
appoint
you
you
will
soon
i
hope
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
attend
upon
her
wishes
as
you
would
upon
mine
be
her
servant
and
her
guard
and
when
we
meet
again
as
she
will
then
be
under
the
protection
of
her
father
if
you
do
not
prefer
so
gentle
a
service
before
the
rougher
one
of
war
i
will
resume
you
to
myself
the
youth
who
had
obeyed
the
knight
and
risen
bowed
respectfully
and
helen
uttering
some
incoherent
words
of
thanks
to
hide
her
agitation
turned
away
the
hermit
exclaimed
again
my
son
i
beseech
heaven
to
bless
thee
and
may
its
guardian
care
shield
all
here
replied
the
knight
helen
looked
up
to
bid
him
a
last
farewell
but
he
was
gone
the
hermit
had
left
the
cell
with
him
and
the
youth
also
had
disappeared
into
the
inner
cave
being
left
alone
she
threw
herself
down
before
the
altar
and
giving
way
to
a
burst
of
tears
inwardly
implored
protection
for
that
brave
knight
life
and
by
his
means
to
grant
safety
to
wallace
and
freedom
to
her
father
as
she
prayed
her
emotion
subsided
and
a
holy
confidence
elevating
her
mind
she
remained
in
an
ecstasy
of
hope
till
a
solemn
voice
from
behind
her
called
her
from
this
happy
trance
blessed
are
they
which
put
their
trust
in
god
she
calmly
rose
and
perceived
the
hermit
who
on
entering
had
observed
her
devout
position
and
the
spontaneous
benediction
broke
from
his
lips
daughter
said
he
leading
her
to
a
seat
this
hero
will
prevail
for
the
power
before
whose
altar
you
have
just
knelt
has
declared
might
is
with
them
who
obey
my
laws
and
put
their
trust
in
me
you
speak
highly
of
the
young
and
valiant
sir
william
wallace
but
i
can
not
conceive
that
he
can
be
better
formed
for
great
and
heroic
deeds
than
this
chief
suppose
them
then
to
be
equal
when
they
have
met
with
two
such
leaders
what
may
not
a
few
determined
scots
perform
helen
sympathized
with
the
cheering
prognostications
of
the
hermit
and
wishing
to
learn
the
name
of
this
rival
of
a
character
she
had
regarded
as
unparalleled
she
asked
with
a
blush
by
what
title
she
must
call
the
knight
who
had
undertaken
so
hazardous
an
enterprise
for
her
chapter
xvii
the
hermit
cell
i
know
not
returned
the
hermit
i
never
saw
your
gallant
deliverer
before
yesterday
morning
broken
from
my
matins
by
a
sudden
noise
i
beheld
a
deer
rush
down
the
precipice
and
fall
headlong
as
he
lay
struggling
amongst
the
stones
at
the
entrance
of
my
cave
i
had
just
observed
an
arrow
in
his
side
when
a
shout
issued
from
the
rocks
above
and
looking
up
i
beheld
a
young
chieftain
with
a
bow
in
his
hand
leaping
from
cliff
to
cliff
till
springing
from
a
high
projection
on
the
right
he
alighted
at
once
at
the
head
of
the
wounded
deer
i
emerged
from
the
recess
that
concealed
me
and
addressed
him
with
the
benediction
of
the
morning
his
plaided
followers
immediately
appeared
and
with
a
stroke
of
their
ready
weapons
slew
the
animal
the
chief
left
them
to
dress
it
for
their
own
refreshment
and
on
my
invitation
entered
the
cell
to
share
a
hermit
fare
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
what
had
driven
me
to
this
seclusion
in
return
he
informed
me
of
a
design
he
had
conceived
to
stimulate
the
surrounding
chiefs
to
some
exertions
for
their
country
but
as
he
never
mentioned
his
name
i
concluded
he
wished
it
to
remain
unrevealed
and
therefore
i
forbore
to
inquire
it
i
imparted
to
him
my
doubts
of
the
possibility
of
any
single
individual
being
able
to
arouse
the
slumbering
courage
of
thoughts
the
arguments
he
means
to
use
are
few
and
conclusive
they
are
these
the
perfidy
of
king
edward
who
deemed
a
prince
of
high
honor
had
been
chosen
umpire
in
the
cause
of
bruce
and
baliol
he
accepted
the
task
in
the
character
of
a
friend
to
scotland
but
no
sooner
was
he
advanced
into
the
heart
of
our
kingdom
and
at
the
head
of
the
large
army
he
had
treacherously
introduced
as
a
mere
appendage
of
state
than
he
declared
the
act
of
judgement
was
his
right
as
liege
lord
of
the
realm
this
falsehood
which
our
records
disproved
at
the
outset
was
not
his
only
baseness
he
bought
the
conscience
of
baliol
and
adjudged
to
him
the
throne
the
recreant
prince
acknowledged
him
his
master
and
in
that
degrading
ceremony
of
homage
he
was
followed
by
almost
all
the
lowland
scottish
lords
but
this
vile
yielding
did
not
purchase
them
peace
edward
demanded
oppressive
services
from
the
king
and
the
castles
of
the
nobility
to
be
resigned
to
english
governors
these
requisitions
being
remonstrated
against
by
a
few
of
our
boldest
chiefs
amongst
whom
your
illustrious
father
gentle
lady
stood
the
most
conspicuous
the
tyrant
repeated
them
with
additional
demands
and
prepared
to
resent
the
appeal
on
the
whole
nation
three
months
have
hardly
elapsed
since
the
fatal
battle
of
dunbar
where
indignant
at
the
accumulated
outrages
committed
on
their
passive
monarch
our
irritated
nobles
at
last
rose
but
too
late
to
assert
their
rights
alas
one
defeat
drove
them
to
despair
baliol
was
taken
and
themselves
obliged
to
again
swear
fealty
to
their
enemy
then
came
the
seizure
of
the
treasures
of
our
monasteries
the
burning
of
the
national
records
the
sequestration
of
our
property
the
banishment
of
our
chiefs
the
violation
of
our
women
and
the
slavery
or
murder
of
the
poor
people
yoked
to
the
land
storm
of
desolation
thus
raging
over
our
country
how
cried
the
young
warrior
to
me
any
of
her
sons
shrink
from
the
glory
of
again
attempting
her
restoration
he
then
informed
me
that
earl
de
warenne
whom
edward
had
left
lord
warden
of
scotland
was
taken
ill
and
retired
to
london
leaving
aymer
de
valence
to
be
his
deputy
to
this
new
tyrant
de
warenne
has
lately
sent
a
host
of
mercenaries
to
hold
the
south
of
scotland
in
subjection
and
to
reinforce
cressingham
and
ormsby
two
noted
plunderers
who
command
northward
from
stirling
to
the
shores
of
sutherland
with
these
representations
of
the
conduct
of
our
oppressors
the
brave
knight
demonstrated
the
facility
with
which
invaders
drunk
with
power
and
gorged
with
rapine
could
be
vanquished
by
a
resolute
and
hardy
people
the
absence
of
edward
who
is
now
abroad
increases
the
probability
of
success
the
knight
design
is
to
infuse
his
own
spirit
into
the
bosoms
of
the
chiefs
in
this
part
of
the
kingdom
by
their
assistance
to
seize
the
fortresses
in
the
lowlands
and
so
form
a
chain
of
repulsion
against
the
admission
of
fresh
troops
from
england
then
while
other
chiefs
to
whom
he
means
to
apply
rise
in
the
highlands
the
southron
garrisons
there
being
unsupported
by
supplies
must
become
an
easy
prey
and
would
yield
men
of
consequence
to
be
exchanged
for
our
countrymen
now
prisoners
in
england
for
the
present
he
wishes
to
be
furnished
with
troops
merely
enough
to
take
some
castle
of
power
sufficient
to
give
confidence
to
his
friends
on
his
becoming
master
of
such
a
place
it
should
be
the
signal
for
all
to
declare
themselves
and
rising
at
once
overwhelm
edward
garrisons
in
every
part
of
scotland
this
is
the
knight
plan
and
for
your
sake
as
well
as
for
the
cause
i
hope
the
first
fortress
he
gains
may
be
that
of
dumbarton
it
has
been
always
considered
the
key
of
the
country
may
heaven
grant
it
holy
father
returned
helen
and
whoever
this
knight
may
be
i
pray
the
blessed
andrew
to
guide
his
arms
if
i
may
venture
to
guess
who
he
is
replied
the
hermit
i
would
say
that
noble
brow
was
formed
to
some
day
wear
a
crown
what
cried
helen
starting
you
think
this
knight
is
the
royal
bruce
i
am
at
a
loss
what
to
think
replied
the
hermit
he
has
a
most
princely
air
and
there
is
such
an
overflowing
of
soul
toward
his
country
when
he
speaks
of
it
that
such
love
can
spring
from
no
other
than
the
royal
heart
created
to
foster
and
to
bless
it
but
is
he
not
too
young
inquired
helen
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
bruce
lord
of
annandale
the
opponent
of
baliol
for
the
crown
was
much
his
senior
and
that
his
son
the
earl
of
carrick
must
be
now
fifty
years
of
age
this
knight
if
i
am
any
judge
of
looks
can
not
be
true
answered
the
hermit
and
yet
he
may
be
a
bruce
for
it
is
neither
of
the
two
you
have
mentioned
that
i
mean
but
the
grandson
of
the
one
and
the
son
of
the
other
you
may
see
by
this
silver
beard
lady
that
the
winter
of
my
life
is
far
spent
the
elder
bruce
robert
lord
of
annandale
was
my
contemporary
we
were
boys
together
and
educated
at
the
same
college
in
icolmkill
he
was
brave
and
passed
his
manhood
in
visiting
different
courts
at
last
marrying
a
lady
of
the
princely
house
of
clare
he
took
her
to
france
and
confided
his
only
son
to
be
brought
up
under
the
renowned
louis
this
young
robert
took
the
cross
while
quite
a
youth
and
carrying
the
banner
of
the
holy
king
of
france
to
the
plains
of
palestine
covered
himself
with
glory
in
storming
a
saracen
fortress
he
rescued
the
person
of
prince
edward
of
england
the
horrible
tyrant
who
now
tramples
on
all
laws
human
and
divine
was
then
in
the
bloom
of
youth
defending
the
cause
of
christianity
think
on
that
sweet
lady
and
marvel
at
the
changing
power
of
ambition
from
that
hour
a
strict
friendship
subsisted
between
the
two
young
crusaders
and
when
edward
mounted
the
throne
of
england
it
being
then
the
ally
of
scotland
the
old
earl
of
annandale
to
please
his
brave
son
took
up
his
residence
at
the
english
court
when
the
male
issue
of
our
king
david
failed
in
the
untimely
death
of
alexander
then
came
the
contention
between
bruce
and
baliol
for
the
vacant
crown
our
most
venerable
chiefs
the
guardians
of
our
laws
and
the
witnesses
of
the
parliamentary
settlement
made
on
the
house
of
bruce
during
the
reign
of
the
late
king
all
declared
for
lord
annandale
he
was
not
only
the
male
heir
in
propinquity
of
blood
but
his
experienced
years
and
known
virtues
excited
all
true
scots
to
place
him
on
the
throne
meanwhile
edward
forgetting
friendship
to
his
friend
and
fidelity
to
a
faithful
ally
was
undermining
the
interest
of
bruce
and
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
inferior
rivals
to
our
favorite
to
our
favorite
prince
were
soon
discountenanced
but
by
covert
ways
with
bribes
and
promises
the
king
of
england
raised
such
a
opposition
on
the
side
of
baliol
as
threatened
a
civil
war
secure
in
his
right
and
averse
to
plunging
his
country
in
blood
bruce
easily
fell
in
with
a
proposal
insidiously
hinted
to
him
by
one
of
edward
creatures
require
that
monarch
to
be
umpire
between
him
and
baliol
then
it
was
that
edward
after
soliciting
the
requisition
as
an
honor
to
be
conferred
on
him
declared
it
was
his
right
as
supreme
lord
of
scotland
the
earl
of
annandale
refused
to
acknowledge
this
assumption
baliol
bowed
to
it
and
for
such
obedience
the
unrighteous
judge
gave
him
the
crown
bruce
absolutely
refused
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
this
decision
and
so
to
avoid
the
power
of
the
king
who
had
betrayed
his
rights
and
the
jealousy
of
the
other
who
had
usurped
them
he
immediately
left
the
scene
of
action
going
over
seas
to
join
his
son
who
had
been
cajoled
away
to
paris
but
alas
he
died
on
the
road
of
a
broken
heart
when
his
son
robert
who
was
earl
of
carrick
in
right
of
his
wife
returned
to
britain
he
like
his
father
disdained
to
acknowledge
baliol
as
king
but
being
more
incensed
at
his
successful
rival
than
at
the
treachery
of
his
false
friend
edward
he
believed
his
glossing
speeches
and
by
what
infatuation
i
can
not
tell
established
his
residence
at
the
monarch
court
this
forgetfulness
of
his
royal
blood
and
of
the
independence
of
scotland
has
nearly
obliterated
him
from
every
scottish
heart
for
when
we
look
at
bruce
the
courtier
we
cease
to
remember
bruce
the
descendant
of
the
valiant
knight
of
the
cross
who
bled
for
true
liberty
before
the
walls
of
jerusalem
his
eldest
son
may
be
now
about
the
age
of
the
young
knight
who
has
just
left
us
and
when
i
look
on
his
royal
port
and
listen
to
the
patriotic
fervors
of
his
royal
soul
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
spirit
of
his
noble
grandsire
has
revived
in
his
breast
and
that
leaving
his
indolent
father
to
the
vassal
luxuries
of
edward
palace
he
is
come
hither
in
secret
to
arouse
scotland
and
to
assert
his
claim
it
is
very
likely
rejoined
helen
deeply
sighing
and
may
heaven
reward
his
virtue
with
the
crown
of
his
ancestors
to
that
end
replied
the
hermit
shall
my
hands
be
lifted
up
in
prayer
day
and
night
may
i
o
gracious
power
cried
he
looking
upward
and
pressing
the
cross
to
his
breast
live
but
to
see
that
hero
victorious
and
scotland
free
and
then
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
since
mine
eyes
will
have
seen
her
salvation
her
salvation
father
said
helen
timidly
is
not
that
too
sacred
a
word
to
apply
to
anything
however
dear
that
relates
to
earth
she
blushed
as
she
spoke
and
fearful
of
having
too
daringly
objected
looked
down
as
she
awaited
his
answer
the
hermit
observed
her
attentively
and
with
a
benign
smile
replied
earth
and
heaven
are
the
work
of
the
creator
he
careth
alike
for
angel
and
for
man
and
therefore
nothing
that
he
has
made
is
too
mean
to
be
the
object
of
his
salvation
the
word
is
comprehensive
in
one
sense
it
may
signify
our
redemption
from
sin
and
death
by
the
coming
of
the
lord
of
life
into
this
world
and
in
another
it
intimates
the
different
means
b
which
providence
decrees
the
ultimate
happiness
of
men
happiness
can
only
be
found
in
virtue
virtue
can
not
exit
without
liberty
and
the
seat
of
liberty
is
good
laws
hence
when
scotland
is
again
made
free
the
bonds
of
the
tyrant
who
corrupts
her
principles
with
temptations
or
compels
her
to
iniquity
by
threats
are
broken
again
the
honest
peasant
may
cultivate
his
lands
in
security
the
liberal
hand
feed
the
hungry
and
industry
spread
smiling
plenty
through
all
ranks
every
man
to
whom
his
maker
hath
given
talents
let
them
be
one
or
five
may
apply
them
to
their
use
and
by
eating
the
bread
of
peaceful
labor
rear
families
to
virtuous
action
and
the
worship
of
god
the
nobles
meanwhile
looking
alone
to
the
legislation
of
heaven
and
to
the
laws
of
scotland
which
alike
demand
justice
and
mercy
from
all
will
live
the
fathers
of
their
country
teaching
her
brave
sons
that
the
only
homage
which
does
not
debase
a
man
is
that
which
he
pays
to
virtue
and
to
god
this
it
is
to
be
free
this
it
is
to
be
virtuous
this
it
is
to
be
happy
this
it
is
to
live
the
life
of
righteousness
and
to
die
in
the
hope
of
immortal
glory
say
then
dear
daughter
if
in
praying
for
the
liberty
of
scotland
i
said
too
much
in
calling
it
her
salvation
forgive
me
father
cried
helen
overcome
with
shame
at
having
questioned
him
forgive
you
what
returned
he
i
love
the
holy
zeal
which
is
jealous
of
allowing
objects
dear
even
to
your
wishes
to
encroach
on
the
sanctuary
of
heaven
be
ever
thus
meek
child
of
the
church
and
no
human
idol
will
be
able
to
usurp
that
part
of
your
virgin
heart
which
belongs
to
god
helen
blushed
my
heart
reverend
father
returned
she
has
but
one
wish
the
liberty
of
scotland
and
with
that
the
safety
of
my
father
and
his
brave
deliverers
sir
william
wallace
i
never
have
seen
rejoined
the
hermit
but
when
he
was
quite
a
youth
i
heard
of
his
graceful
victories
in
the
mimic
war
of
the
jousts
at
berwick
when
edward
first
marched
into
this
country
under
the
mask
of
friendship
from
what
you
have
said
i
do
not
doubt
his
being
a
worthy
supporter
of
bruce
however
dear
daughter
as
it
is
only
a
suspicion
of
mine
that
this
knight
is
that
young
prince
for
his
safety
and
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
we
must
not
let
that
name
escape
our
lips
no
not
even
to
your
relations
when
you
rejoin
them
nor
to
the
youth
whom
his
humanity
put
under
my
protection
till
he
reveals
his
own
secret
for
us
to
divulge
it
would
be
folly
and
dishonor
helen
bowed
acquiescence
and
the
hermit
proceeded
to
inform
her
who
the
youth
was
whom
the
stranger
had
left
to
be
her
page
in
addition
to
what
the
knight
had
himself
told
her
of
walter
hay
the
unfortunate
shepherd
boy
of
the
ruined
hut
her
venerable
host
narrated
that
the
young
warrior
having
quitted
the
holy
cell
after
his
first
appearance
there
soon
returned
with
the
wounded
youth
whom
he
had
found
he
committed
him
to
the
care
of
the
hermit
promising
to
revisit
him
on
his
way
from
the
south
and
take
the
recovered
walter
under
his
own
protection
he
then
left
us
continued
the
old
man
but
soon
reappeared
with
you
showing
in
the
strongest
language
that
he
who
in
spite
of
every
danger
succors
the
sons
and
daughters
of
violated
scotland
is
proclaimed
by
the
spirit
of
heaven
to
be
her
future
deliverer
and
king
as
he
ended
speaking
he
rose
and
taking
helen
by
the
hand
led
her
into
an
inner
excavation
of
the
rock
where
a
bed
of
dried
leaves
lay
on
the
ground
here
gentle
lady
said
he
i
leave
you
to
repose
in
the
evening
i
expect
a
lay
brother
from
oran
monastery
and
he
will
be
your
messenger
to
the
friends
you
may
wish
to
rejoin
at
present
may
gentlest
seraphs
guard
your
slumbers
helen
fatigued
in
spirit
and
in

thanked
the
good
hermit
for
his

guided
by
ker
murray
led
his
followers
over
the
lanark
hills
by
the
most
untrodden
paths
and
hence
avoided
even
the
sight
of
a
southron
soldier
cheered
by
so
favourable
a
commencement
of
their
expedition
they
even
felt
no
dismay
when
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
ker
descried
a
body
of
armed
men
at
a
distance
sitting
round
a
fire
at
the
foot
of
a
beetling
rock
which
guards
the
western
entrance
to
the
cartlane
craigs
murray
ordered
his
men
to
proceed
under
covert
of
the
bushes
and
then
making
the
signal
concerted
in
case
of
such
dilemma
they
stuck
their
iron
crows
into
the
interstices
of
the
cliff
and
catching
at
the
branches
which
grew
out
of
its
precipitous
side
with
much
exertion
but
in
perfect
silence
at
last
gained
the
summit
that
effected
they
pursued
their
way
with
the
same
caution
till
after
a
long
march
and
without
encountering
a
human
being
they
reached
the
base
of
the
huge
rock
which
wallace
had
made
his
fortress
ker
who
expected
to
find
it
surrounded
by
the
english
army
was
amazed
at
the
solitude
the
place
is
deserted
cried
he
my
brave
friend
compelled
by
the
extremity
of
his
little
garrison
has
been
obliged
to
surrender
we
will
ascend
and
see
was
murray
answer
ker
led
round
the
rock
to
the
most
accessible
point
and
mounting
by
the
projecting
stones
with
some
difficulty
gained
the
top
silence
pervaded
every
part
and
the
rugged
cavities
at
the
summit
which
had
formed
the
temporary
quarters
of
his
comrades
were
lonely
on
entering
the
recess
where
wallace
used
to
seek
a
few
minutes
slumber
the
moon
which
shone
full
into
the
cave
discovered
something
bright
lying
in
a
distant
corner
ker
hastily
approached
it
recollecting
what
means
of
escape
he
would
leave
some
weapon
as
a
sign
a
dagger
if
necessity
drove
him
to
the
south
point
where
he
must
fight
his
way
through
the
valley
an
arrow
if
he
could
effect
it
without
observation
by
the
north
as
he
should
then
seek
an
asylum
for
his
exhausted
followers
in
the
wilds
of
glenfinlass
it
was
the
iron
head
of
an
arrow
which
the
moon
had
silvered
and
ker
catching
it
up
with
a
gladdened
countenance
exclaimed
he
is
safe
this
calls
us
to
glenfinlass
he
then
explained
to
murray
what
had
been
the
arrangement
of
wallace
respecting
this
sign
and
without
hesitation
the
young
lord
decided
to
follow
him
up
that
track
turning
toward
the
northern
part
of
the
cliff
they
came
to
spot
beneath
which
had
been
the
strongest
guard
of
the
enemy
but
now
like
the
rest
it
was
entirely
abandoned
a
narrow
winding
path
led
from
this
rocky
platform
to
a
fall
of
water
rearing
and
rushing
by
the
mouth
of
a
large
cavern
after
they
had
descended
the
main
craig
they
clambered
over
the
top
of
this
cave
and
entering
upon
another
sweep
of
rugged
hills
commenced
a
rapid
march
traversing
the
lower
part
of
stirlingshire
they
crossed
dike
and
pursuing
their
course
westward
left
stirling
castle
far
to
the
right
they
ascended
the
ochil
hills
and
proceeding
along
the
wooded
heights
which
overhang
the
banks
of
teith
forded
that
river
and
entered
at
once
into
the
broad
valley
which
opened
to
them
a
distant
view
of
ben
lomond
and
ben
ledi
great
wall
of
severus
which
runs
between
abercorn
and
kirkpatrick
being
attacked
by
the
scotts
at
the
time
the
romans
abandoned
britain
a
huge
breach
was
made
in
it
by
graham
or
greame
the
uncle
of
the
young
king
of
scots
by
this
achievement
he
conquered
the
whole
of
the
country
as
far
as
the
cheviots
and
the
wall
of
severus
has
since
been
called

there
exclaimed
ker
extending
his
hand
toward
the
ledi
beneath
the
shadow
of
that
mountain
we
shall
find
the
light
of
scotland
our
dear
master
in
arms
at
this
intimation
the
wearied
murrays
like
seamen
long
harassed
on
a
tempestuous
ocean
at
sight
of
a
port
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
and
hastening
forward
with
renovated
strength
met
a
foaming
river
in
their
path
despising
all
obstacles
they
rushed
in
and
buffeting
the
waves
soon
found
a
firm
footing
on
the
opposite
shore
the
sun
shone
cheerily
above
their
heads
illuminating
the
umbrageous
sides
of
the
mountains
with
a
dewy
splendor
while
ben
ledi
the
standard
of
their
hope
seemed
to
wave
them
on
as
the
white
clouds
streamed
from
its
summit
or
rolling
down
its
dark
sides
floated
in
strange
visionary
shapes
over
the
lakes
beneath
when
the
little
troop
halted
on
the
shore
of
loch
venachoir
the
mists
which
had
lingered
on
the
brow
of
ledi
slowly
descended
into
the
valley
and
covering
the
mouth
of
the
pass
that
led
from
the
loch
seemed
to
shut
them
at
once
between
the
mountain
and
that
world
of
waters
ker
who
had
never
been
in
these
tracks
before
wondered
at
their
sublimity
and
became
alarmed
lest
they
should
lose
their
way
amid
such
infinite
windings
but
murray
who
remembered
having
once
explored
them
with
his
father
led
promptly
forward
by
a
steep
rough
road
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
as
they
clung
by
the
slippery
rocks
which
overhung
the
lake
its
mists
dissolved
into
a
heavy
shower
and
by
degrees
clearing
away
discovered
the
shining
heads
of
ben
lomond
and
ben
chochan
the
party
soon
entered
a
precipitous
labyrinth
of
craigs
and
passing
onward
gradually
descended
amid
pouring
torrents
and
gaping
chasms
overlaced
with
branching
trees
till
the
augmented
roar
of
waters
intimated
to
murray
they
drew
near
the
great
fall
of
glenfinlass
the
river
though
rushing
on
its
course
with
the
noise
of
thunder
was
scarcely
discerned
through
the
thick
forest
which
groaned
over
its
waves
here
towered
a
host
of
stately
pines
and
there
the
lofty
beeches
birches
and
bending
over
the
flood
interwove
their
giant
arms
forming
an
arch
so
impenetrable
that
while
the
sun
brightened
the
tops
of
the
mountains
all
beneath
lay
in
deepest
midnight
the
awful
entrance
to
this
sublime
valley
struck
the
whole
party
with
a
feeling
that
made
them
pause
it
seemed
as
it
to
these
sacred
solitudes
hidden
in
the
very
bosom
of
scotland
no
hostile
foot
dared
intrude
murray
looked
at
ker
we
go
my
friend
to
arouse
the
genius
of
our
country
here
are
the
native
fastnesses
of
scotland
and
from
this
pass
the
spirit
will
issue
that
is
to
bid
her
enslaved
sons
and
daughters
be
free
they
entered
and
with
beating
hearts
pursued
their
way
along
the
western
border
of
loch
lubnaig
till
the
royal
heights
of
craignacoheilg
showed
their
summits
covered
with
heath
and
many
an
ivied
turret
the
forest
stretching
far
over
the
valley
lost
its
high
trees
in
the
shadows
of
the
surrounding
mountains
and
told
them
they
were
now
in
the
center
of
glenfinlass
ker
put
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
sounded
the
pibroch
of
ellerslie
a
thousand
echoes
returned
the
notes
and
after
a
pause
which
allowed
their
last
response
to
die
away
the
air
was
answered
by
a
horn
from
the
heights
of
cragnacoheilg
an
armed
man
then
appeared
on
the
rock
leaning
forward
ker
drew
near
and
taking
off
his
bonnet
called
aloud
stephen
it
is
william
ker
who
speaks
i
come
with
the
lord
andrew
murray
of

to
the
support
of
our
commander
sir
william
wallace
at
these
words
stephen
placed
his
bugle
to
his
mouth
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
rock
was
covered
with
the
members
of
its
little
garrison
women
and
children
appeared
shouting
with
joy
and
the
men
descending
the
side
near
the
glen
hastened
to
bid
their
comrade
welcome
one
advanced
toward
murray
whom
he
instantly
recognized
to
be
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
of
torthorald
the
chiefs
saluted
each
other
and
lord
andrew
pointed
to
his
men
i

he
these
few
brave
fellows
to
the
aid
of
sir
william
wallace
they
should
have
been
more
but
for
new
events
of
southron
outrage
yet
i
am
impatient
to
lead
them
to
the
presence
of
my
uncle
preserver
kirkpatrick

disappointed
the
eager
spirit
of
the
young
warrior
i
am
sorry
brave
murray
that
you
have
no
better
knight
to
receive
you
than
myself
i
and
the
gallant
chief
have
not
yet
met
but
i
am
in
arms
for
him
and
the
hour
of
retribution
for
all
our
injuries
i
trust
is
at
hand
but
where
is
sir
william
wallace
demanded
murray
gone
toward
the
forth
to
rouse
that
part
of
sleeping
scotland
if
all
he
meet
have
my
spirit
they
will
not
require
a
second
call
now
is
the
time
to
aim
the
blow
i
shall
ever
give
thanks
to
the
accident
which
brought
me
the
welcome
news
that
an
arm
is
raised
to
strike
it
home
as
he
spoke
he
led
murray
to
the
cliffs
which
crown
the
summit
of
craignacoheilg
in
the
midst
stood
a
tower
which
had
once
been
a
favorite
of
the
great
king
fergus
there
kirkpatrick
joyfully
greeted
his
guest
a
second
time
this
said
he
is

lodge
of

durstus
the
pict
and
dionethus
the
briton
spread
his
board
during
their
huntings
in
glenfinlass
and
here
eight
hundred
years
ago
did
the
same
heroic
prince
form
the
plans
which
saved
his
kingdom
from
a
foreign
yoke
on
the
same
spot
we
will
lay
ours
and
in
their
completion
rescue
scotland
from
a
tyranny
more
intolerable
than
that
which
menaced
him
yes
murray
there
is
not
a
stone
in
this
building
that
does
not
call
aloud
to
us
to
draw
the
sword
and
hold
it
unsheathed
till
our
country
be
free
and
by
the
ghost
of
that
same
fergus
i
swear
exclaimed
murray
that
my
honest
claymore
shall
never
shroud
its
head
while
an
invader
be
left
alive
in
scotland
kirkpatrick
caught
him
in
his
arms
brave
son
of
the
noble
bothwell
thou
art
after
mine
own
heart
the
blow
which
the
dastard
cressingham
durst
aim
at
a
scottish
chief
still
smarts
upon
my
cheek
and
rivers
of
his
countrymen
blood
shall
wash
out
the
stain
after
i
had
been
persuaded
by
his
serpent
eloquence
to
swear
fealty
to
edward
on
the
defeat
at
dunbar
i
vainly
thought
that
scotland
had
only
changed
a
weak
and
unfortunate
prince
for
a
wise
and
victorious
king
but
when
in
the
courts
of
stirling
i
heard
cressingham
propose
to
the
barons
north
of
the
dike
that
they
should
give
their
strongest
castles
into
english
hands
when
i
opposed
the
measure
with
all
the
indignation
of
a
scot
who
saw
himself
betrayed
he
first
tried
to
overturn
my
arguments
and
finding
that
impossible
while
i
repeated
them
with
redoubled
force
he
struck
me
of
earth
and
heaven
what
was
then
the
tempest
of
my
soul
drew
my
sword
i
would
have
laid
him
dead
at
my
feet
had
not
my
obsequious
countrymen
held
my
arm
and
dragged
me
from
the
apartment
covered
with
dishonor
by
a
blow
i
could
not
avenge
i
fled
to
my
sir
john
scott
of
loch
doine
with
him
i
buried
my
injury
from
the
world
but
it
lived
in
my
heart
it
haunted
me
day
and
night
calling
for
revenge
in
such
an
hour
how
did
i
receive
the
tidings
that
sir
william
wallace
was
in
arms
against
the
tyrant
it
was
the
voice
of
retribution
calling
me
to
peace
of
mind
even
my
bedridden
kinsman
partook
my
emotions
and
with
his
zealous
concurrence
i
led
a
band
of
his
hardiest
clansmen
to
reinforce
the
brave
men
of
lanark
on
this
rock
two
days
i
have
now
been
here
awaiting
in
anxious
impatience
the
arrival
of
wallace
yes
we
will
mingle
our
injured
souls
together
he
has
made
one
offering
i
must
make
another
we
shall
set
forth
to
stirling
and
there
in
the
very
heart
of
his
den
i
will
sacrifice
the
tiger
cressingham
to
the
vengeance
of
our
wrongs
but
what
my
brave
friend
asked
murray
are
the
forces
you
deem
sufficient
for
so
great
an
enterprise
how
many
fighting
men
may
be
counted
of
wallace
own
company
besides
your
own
we
have
here
about
a
hundred
replied
kirkpatrick
including
yours
how
inadequate
to
storm
so
formidable
a
place
as
stirling
castle
returned
murray
having
indeed
passed
the
rubicon
we
must
go
forward
but
resolution
not
rashness
should
be
the
principle
of
our
actions
and
my
opinion
is
that
a
few
minor
advantages
obtained
our
countrymen
would
flock
to
our
standard
the
enemy
would
be
intimidated
and
we
should
carry
thousands
instead
of
hundreds
before
the
walls
of
stirling
to
attempt
it
now
would
invite
defeat
and
bring
upon
us
the
ruin
of
our
entire
project
you
are
right
young
man
cried
kirkpatrick
my
gray
head
rendered
impetuous
by
insult
did
not
pause
on
the
blind
temerity
of
my
scheme
i
would
rather
for
years
watch
the
opportunity
of
taking
a
signal
revenge
than
not
accomplish
it
at
last
oh
i
would
rather
waste
all
my
life
in
these
solitary
wilds
and
know
that
at
the
close
of
it
i
should
see
the
blood
of
cressingham
on
these
hands
than
live
a
prince
and
die
unrevenged
stephen
and
ker
now
entered
the
latter
paid
his
respects
to
sir
roger
and
the
former
informed
murray
that
having
disposed
his
present
followers
with
those
who
had
arrived
before
he
was
come
to
lead
their
lord
to
some
refreshment
in
the
banqueting
room
of
the
tower
what
cried
murray
full
of
glad
amazement
is
it
possible
that
my
faithful
band
has
reached
its
destination
none
other
belonging
to
bothwell
castle
had
any
chance
of
escaping
its
jailer
hands
kirkpatrick
interrupted
stephen
reply
by
saying
that
while
their
guests
were
at
the
board
he
would
watch
the
arrival
of
certain
expresses
from
two
brave
drummonds
each
of
whom
was
to
send
him
a
hundred
men
so
my
good
lord
andrew
cried
he
striking
him
on
the
shoulder
shall
the
gather
that
is
to
fall
on
edward
to
his
destruction
murray
heartily
shared
his
zeal
and
bidding
him
a
short
adieu
followed
stephen
and
ker
into
the
hall
a
haunch
of
venison
of
glenfinlass
smoked
on
the
board
and
goblets
of
wine
from
the
bounteous
cellars
of
sir
john
scott
brightened
the
hopes
which
glowed
in
every
heart
while
the
young
chieftains
were
recruiting
their
exhausted
strength
stephen
sat
at
the
table
to
satisfy
the
anxiety
of
murray
to
know
how
the
detachment
from
bothwell
had
come
to
craignacoheilg
and
by
what
fortunate
occurrence
or
signal
act
of
bravery
wallace
could
have
escaped
with
his
whole
train
from
the
foe
surrounding
cartlane
craigs
heaven
smiled
on
us
replied
stephen
the
very
evening
of
the
day
on
which
ker
left
us
there
was
a
carousal
in
the
english
camp
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
song
and
of
riot
and
of
many
an
insult
cast
upon
our
besieged
selves
but
about
an
hour
after
sunset
the
noise
sunk
by
degrees
a
no
insufficient
hint
that
the
revelers
overcome
by
excess
had
fallen
asleep
at
this
very
time
owing
to
the
heat
of
the
day
so
great
a
vapor
had
been
exhaled
from
the
lake
beneath
that
the
whole
of
the
northern
side
of
the
fortress
cliff
was
covered
with
a
mist
so
exceedingly
thick
we
could
not
discern
each
other
at
a
distance
is
the
moment
said
our
gallant
leader
enemy
are
stupefied
with
wine
the
rock
is
clothed
in
a
veil
is
the
shield
of
god
that
is
held
before
us
under
its
shelter
let
us
pass
from
their
hands
he
called
us
together
and
making
the
proper
dispositions
commanded
the
children
and
women
on
their
lives
to
keep
silence
he
then
led
us
to
the
top
of
the
northern
cliff
it
overhung
an
obscure
cave
which
he
knew
opened
at
its
extremity
by
the
assistance
of
a
rope
held
above
by
several
men
our
resolute
chief
twisting
it
round
one
arm
to
steady
him
and
with
the
other
catching
by
the
projecting
stones
of
the
precipice
made
his
way
down
the
rock
and
was
the
first
who
descended
he
stood
at
the
bottom
enveloped
in
the
cloud
which
shrouded
the
mountain
till
all
the
men
of
the
first
division
had
cleared
the
height
he
then
marshaled
them
with
their
pikes
toward
the
foe
in
case
of
an
alarm
but
all
remained
quiet
on
that
spot
although
the
sounds
of
voices
both
in
song
and
laughter
intimated
that
the
utmost
precaution
was
still
necessary
as
a
wakeful
and
yet
reveling
part
of
the
enemy
were
not
far
distant
wallace
reascended
the
rock
half
way
and
receiving
the
children
which
their
trembling
mothers
lowered
into
this
arms
he
handed
them
to
the
old
men
who
carried
them
safely
through
the
bushes
which
obscured
the
cave
mouth
the
rest
of
our
little
garrison
soon
followed
then
our
sentinels
receiving
the
signal
that
all
were
safe
drew
silently
from
their
guard
and
closed
our
march
through
the
cavern
this
effected
we
blocked
up
its
egressing
mouth
that
should
our
escape
be
discovered
the
enemy
might
not
find
the
direct
road
we
had
taken
we
pursued
our
course
without
stop
or
stay
till
we
reached
the
hospitable
valleys
of
stirlingshire
there
some
king
shepherds
gave
the
woman
and
children
temporary
shelter
and
wallace
seeing
that
if
anything
were
to
be
done
for
scotland
he
must
swell
the
host
put
the
part
under
my
guidance
giving
me
orders
that
when
they
were
rested
i
should
march
them
to
glenfinlass
here
to
await
his
return
selecting
ten
men
with
that
small
band
he
turned
toward
the
forth
hoping
to
meet
some
valiant
friends
in
that
part
of
the
country
read
to
embrace
her
cause
he
had
hardly
been
an
hour
departed
when
dugald
observed
a
procession
of
monks
descending
the
opposite
mountain
they
drew
near
and
halted
in
the
glen
a
crowd
of
women
from
the
neighboring
hills
had
followed
the
train
and
were
now
gathering
around
a
bier
which
the
monks
set
down
i
know
not
by
what
happy
fortune
i
came
close
to
the
leader
of
the
procession
but
he
saw
something
in
my
old
rough
features
that
declared
me
an
honest
scot
whispered
he
charity
conduct
us
to
some
safe
place
where
we
may
withdraw
this
bier
from
the
sacrilegious
eye
of
curiosity
i
made
no
hesitation
but
desired
the
train
to
follow
me
into
a
byre
belonging
to
the
good
shepherd
who
was
my
host
on
this
motion
the
common
people
went
away
and
the
monks
entered
the
place
when
the
travelers
threw
up
their
hoods
which
as
mourners
they
had
worn
over
their
faces
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
for
the
glory
of
scotland
that
this
goodly
group
of
stout
young
men
rather
wear
the
cowl
than
the
helmet
asked
their
principal
who
did
not
appear
to
have
seen
thirty
years
we
not
pray
for
the
glory
of
scotland
such
is
our
weapon
replied
i
while
moses
prayed
joshua
fought
god
gives
the
means
of
glory
that
they
should
be
used
for
what
old
veteran
said
the
monk
with
a
penetrating
look
we
exchange
our
cowl
for
the
helmet
knowest
thou
anything
of
the
joshua
who
would
lead
us
to
the
field
there
was
something
in
the
young
priest
eyes
that
seemed
to
contradict
his
pacific
words
they
flashed
as
impetuous
fire
my
reply
was
short
you
a
scot
am
in
soul
and
in
arms
knowest
thou
not
the
chief
of
ellerslie
as
i
spoke
for
i
stood
close
to
the
bier
i
perceived
the
pall
shake
the
monk
answered
my
last
question
with
an
exclamation
mean
sir
william
wallace
i
replied
the
bier
shook
more
violently
at
these
words
and
with
my
hair
bristling
from
my
head
i
saw
the
pall
hastily
thrown
off
and
a
beautiful
youth
in
a
shroud
started
from
it
crying
aloud
is
our
pilgrimage
at
an
end
lead
us
to
him
the
monk
perceived
my
terror
and
hastily
exclaimed
not
he
is
alive
and
seeks
sir
william
wallace
his
pretended
death
was
a
stratagem
to
insure
our
passage
through
the
english
army
for
we
are
soldiers
like
yourself
as
he
spoke
he
opened
his
gray
habit
and
showed
me
the
mailed
tartans
beneath
what
then
interrupted
murray
these
monks
were
my
faithful
clansmen
the
same
replied
stephen
i
assured
them
that
they
might
now
resume
their
own
character
for
all
who
inhabited
the
valley
we
were
then
in
were
true
though
poor
and
aged
scots
the
young
had
long
been
drafted
by
edward
agents
to
fight
his
battles
abroad
interrupted
the
shrouded
youth
we
a
people
that
can
die
for
the
honor
of
this
usurper
and
are
we
ignorant
how
to
do
it
for
our
country
lead
us
soldier
of
wallace
cried
he
stepping
resolutely
on
the
ground
us
to
your
brave
master
and
tell
him
that
a
few
determined
men
are
come
to
shed
their
blood
for
him
and
scotland
this
astonishing
youth
for
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
fifteen
stood
before
me
in
his
robes
of
death
like
the
spirit
of
some
son
of
fingal
i
looked
on
him
with
admiration
and
explaining
our
situation
told
him
whither
wallace
was
gone
and
of
our
destination
to
await
him
in
the
forest
of
glenfinlass
while
your
brave
clansmen
were
refreshing
themselves
we
learned
from
kenneth
their
conductor
that
the
troop
left
bothwell
under
expectation
of
your
soon
following
them
they
had
well
under
expectation
of
our
soon
following
them
they
had
not
proceeded
far
before
their
scouts
perceived
the
outposts
of
the
english
which
surrounded
cartlane
craigs
and
to
avoid
this
danger
they
took
a
circuitous
path
in
hopes
of
finding
some
at
the
western
side
of
the
craigs
kenneth
knew
the
abbot
and
entering
it
under
covert
of
the
night
obtained
permission
for
his
men
to
rest
there
the
youth
now
their
companion
was
a
student
in
the
church
he
had
been
sent
thither
by
his
mother
a
pious
lady
in
the
hope
that
as
he
is
of
a
very
gentle
nature
he
would
attach
himself
to
the
sacred
tonsure
but
courage
often
springs
with
most
strength
in
the
softest
frames
the
moment
this
youth
discovered
our
errand
he
tried
every
persuasion
to
prevail
on
the
abbot
to
permit
him
to
accompany
us
but
his
entreaties
were
vain
till
wrought
up
to
vehement
anger
he
threatened
that
if
he
were
prevented
joining
sir
william
wallace
he
would
take
the
earliest
opportunity
to
escape
and
commit
himself
to
the
peril
of
the
english
pikes
seeing
him
determined
the
abbot
granted
his
wish
then
it
was
said
kenneth
the
youth
seemed
inspired
it
was
no
longer
an
enthusiastic
boy
we
saw
before
us
but
an
angel
gifted
with
wisdom
to
direct
and
enterprise
to
lead
us
it
was
he
proposed
disguising
ourselves
as
a
funeral
procession
and
while
he
painted
his
blooming
countenance
of
a
paleness
and
stretched
himself
on
this
bier
the
abbot
sent
to
the
english
army
to
request
permission
for
a
party
of
monks
to
cross
the
craigs
to
the
cave
of
colomba
in
stirlingshire
whither
they
carried
a
dead
brother
to
be
entombed
our
young
leader
hoped
we
might
thus
find
an
opportunity
to
apprise
wallace
we
were
friends
and
ready
to
swell
the
ranks
of
his
little
armament
our
entrance
into
the
passes
of
the
craigs
continued
kenneth
english
captain
there
mentioned
the
fate
of
bothwell
and
the
captivity
of
lord
mar
and
with
very
little
courtesy
to
sons
of
the
church
ordered
the
bier
to
be
opened
to
see
whether
it
did
really
contain
a
corpse
or
provisions
for
our
besieged
countrymen
we
had
certainly
expected
this
investigation
else
we
might
as
well
have
wrapped
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
the
shroud
we
carried
as
a
human
being
we
knew
that
the
superstitious
hatred
of
the
southrons
would
not
allow
them
to
touch
a
scottish
corpse
and
therefore
we
feared
no
detection
from
the
eye
examination
alone
this
ceremony
once
over
we
expected
to
have
passed
on
without
further
notice
and
in
that
case
the
youth
would
have
left
his
pall
and
performed
the
remainder
of
his
journey
in
a
similar
disguise
with
the
rest
but
the
strict
watch
of
an
english
guard
confined
him
wholly
to
the
bier
in
hopes
of
at
last
evading
this
vigilance
on
pretense
of
a
vow
of
the
deceased
that
his
bearers
should
perform
a
pilgrimage
throughout
the
craigs
we
traversed
them
in
every
direction
and
i
make
no
doubt
would
have
finally
wearied
out
our
guard
and
gained
our
point
had
not
the
circumstance
transpired
of
wallace
escape
he
had
effected
it
his
enemies
could
not
guess
not
a
man
of
the
besiegers
was
missing
from
his
post
and
not
an
avenue
appeared
by
which
they
could
trace
his
flight
but
gone
he
was
and
with
him
his
whole
train
on
this
disappointment
the
southron
captains
retired
to
glasgow
to
their
to
give
as
good
an
account
as
they
could
of
so
disgraceful
a
termination
of
their
siege
dismayed
at
this
intelligence
our
peculiar
guard
hurried
us
into
stirlingshire
and
left
us
at
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
but
even
then
we
were
not
free
to
release
our
charge
for
attracted
by
our
procession
the
country
people
followed
us
into
the
valley
yet
had
we
not
met
with
you
it
was
our
design
to
throw
off
our
disguises
in
the
first
place
and
divided
into
small
bands
have
severally
sought
sir
william
wallace
but
where
demanded
murray
who
had
listened
with
delighted
astonishment
to
this
recital
where
is
this
admirable
youth
why
if
kenneth
have
learned
i
am
arrived
does
he
not
bring
him
to
receive
my
thanks
and
friendship
it
is
my
fault
returned
stephen
that
kenneth
will
not
approach
you
till
your
repast
is
over
i
left
him
to
see
your
followers
properly
refreshed
and
for
the
youth
he
seems
timid
of
appearing
before
you
even
his
name
i
can
not
make
known
to
you
till
he
reveals
it
himself
none
know
him
here
by
any
other
name
than
that
of
edwin
he
has
however
granted
morning
for
the
interview
i
must
submit
to
his
determination
replied
murray
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
guess
why
so
brave
a
creature
should
hesitate
to
meet
me
i
can
only
suppose
he
dislikes
the
idea
of
resigning
the
troop
he
has
so
well
conducted
and
if
so
i
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
yield
its
command
to
him
indeed
he
richly
deserves
it
returned
stephen
for
the
very
soul
of
wallace
seemed
transfused
into
his
breast
as
he
cheered
us
through
our
long
march
from
the
valley
to
glenfinlass
he
played
with
the
children
heartened
up
the
women
and
when
the
men
were
weary
and
lagged
by
the
way
he
sat
down
on
the
nearest
stones
and
sung
to
us
legends
of
our
ancestors
till
every
nerve
was
braced
with
warlike
emulation
and
starting
up
we
proceeded
onward
with
resolution
and
even
gayety
when
we
arrived
at
craignacoheilg
as
the
women
were
in
great
want
i
suddenly
recollected
that
i
had
an
old
friend
in
the
neighborhood
when
a
boy
i
had
been
the
playfellow
of
sir
john
scott
of
loch
doine
and
though
i
understood
him
to
be
now
an
invalid
i
went
to
him
when
i
told
my
tale
his
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
took
fire
at
my
relation
and
declared
his
determination
to
accompany
me
to
craignacoheilg
and
when
he
joined
our
band
on
the
summit
of
this
rock
he
took
the
children
in
his
arms
and
while
he
held
their
hands
in
his
vehemently
addressed
their
mothers
not
these
hands
be
baptized
till
they
had
been
washed
in
the
blood
of
our
foe
mercy
belongs
not
to
the
enemy
now
doomed
to
fall
beneath
their
father
swords
was
a
custom
with
scottish
chiefs
when
any
feud
existed
between
their
families
to
leave
the
right
hand
of
their
children
untouched
by
the
holy
water
in
baptism
as
a
sign
that
no
law
even
of
heaven
should
prevent
them
taking
revenge
it
is
indeed
a
deadly
contest
rejoined
murray
for
evil
has
been
the
example
of
that
foe
how
many
innocent
bosoms
have
their
steel
pierced
how
many
helpless
babes
have
their
merciless
hands
dashed
against
the
stones
oh
ruthless
war
even
a
soldier
trembles
to
contemplate
thy
horrors
only
till
he
can
avenge
them
cried
a
stern
voice
entering
the
apartment
it
was
kirkpatrick
and
he
proceeded
when
vengeance
is
in
our
grasp
tell
me
brave
murray
who
will
then
tremble
dost
thou
not
feel
retribution
in
thine
own
hands
dost
thou
not
see
the
tyrant
blood
at
thy
feet
as
he
spoke
he
looked
down
with
a
horrid
exultation
in
his
eyes
and
bursting
into
a
more
horrible
laugh
struck
his
hand
several
times
on
his
heart
it
glads
me
i
shall
see
it
and
this
arm
shall
assist
to
pull
him
down
his
power
in
scotland
may
fall
returned
murray
but
edward
will
be
too
careful
of
his
life
to
come
within
reach
of
our
steel
that
may
be
rejoined
kirkpatrick
but
my
dagger
shall
yet
drink
the
blood
of
his
agents
cressingham
shall
feel
my
foot
upon
his
neck
cressingham
shall
see
that
hand
torn
from
its
wrist
which
durst
to
violate
the
unsullied
cheek
of
a
true
scotsman
murray
i
can
not
live
unrevenged
as
he
spoke
he
quitted
the
apartment
and
with
a
countenance
of
such
tremendous
fate
that
the
young
warrior
doubted
it
was
human
it
spoke
not
the
noble
resolves
of
patriotism
but
the
portentous
malignity
with
which
the
great
adversary
of
mankind
determines
the
ruin
of
nations
it
seemed
to
wither
the
grass
on
which
he
moved
and
murray
almost
thought
that
the
clouds
darkened
as
the
gloomy
knight
issued
from
the
porch
into
the
open
air
kenneth
mackenzie
joyfully
entered
the
hall
murray
received
him
with
a
warm
embrace
and
soon
after
stephen
ireland
led
the
wearied
chieftain
to
a
bed
of
heath
prepared
for
him
in
an
upper
chamber
chapter
xix
craignacoheilg
sleep
the
gentle
sister
of
that
awful
power
which
shrouds
man
in
its
cold
bosom
and
bears
him
in
still
repose
to
the
blissful
wakefulness
of
eternal
life
she
sweet
restorer
wraps
him
in
her
balmy
embraces
and
extracting
from
his
wearied
limbs
the
effects
of
every
toil
safely
relinquishes
the
refreshed
slumberer
at
morn
to
the
vigor
that
is
her
gift
to
the
gladsome
breezes
which
call
us
forth
to
labor
and
enjoyment
such
was
the
rest
of
the
youthful
murray
till
the
shrill
notes
of
a
hundred
bugles
piercing
his
ear
made
him
start
he
listened
they
sounded
again
the
morning
had
fully
broke
he
sprung
from
his
couch
hurried
on
his
armor
and
snatching
up
his
lance
and
target
issued
from
the
tower
several
women
were
flying
past
the
gate
on
seeing
him
they
exclaimed
the
lord
wallace
is
arrived
his
bugles
have
sounded
our
husbands
are
returned
murray
followed
their
eager
footsteps
and
reached
the
edge
of
the
rock
just
as
the
brave
group
were
ascending
a
stranger
was
also
there
who
from
his
extreme
youth
and
elegance
he
judged
must
be
the
young
protector
of
his
clansmen
but
he
forbore
to
address
him
until
they
should
be
presented
to
each
other
by
wallace
himself
it
was
indeed
the
same
on
hearing
the
first
blast
of
the
horn
the
youthful
chieftain
had
hastened
from
his
bed
of
heath
and
buckling
on
his
brigandine
rushed
to
the
rock
but
at
the
sight
of
the
noble
figure
which
first
gained
the
summit
the
young
hero
fell
back
an
indescribable
awe
checked
his
steps
and
he
stood
at
a
distance
while
kirkpatrick
welcomed
the
chief
and
introduced
lord
andrew
murray
wallace
received
the
latter
with
a
glad
smile
and
taking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
gallant
murray
said
he
with
such
assistance
i
hope
to
reinstate
your
brave
uncle
in
bothwell
castle
and
soon
to
cut
a
passage
to
even
a
mightier
rescue
we
must
carry
off
scotland
from
the
tyrant
arms
or
added
he
in
a
graver
tone
we
shall
only
rivet
her
chains
the
closer
i
am
but
a
poor
auxiliary
returned
murray
my
troop
is
a
scanty
one
for
it
is
my
own
gathering
it
is
not
my
father
nor
my
strength
that
i
bring
along
with
me
but
there
is
one
here
continued
he
who
has
preserved
a
party
of
men
sent
by
my
cousin
lady
helen
mar
almost
double
my
numbers
at
this
reference
to
the
youthful
warrior
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
discerned
him
at
a
distance
and
hastened
toward
him
while
murray
briefly
related
to
wallace
the
extraordinary
conduct
of
this
unknown
on
being
told
that
the
chief
waited
to
receive
him
the
youth
hastened
forward
with
a
trepidation
he
had
never
felt
before
but
it
was
a
trepidation
that
did
not
subtract
from
his
own
worth
it
was
the
timidity
of
a
noble
heart
which
believed
it
approached
one
of
the
most
perfect
among
mortals
and
while
its
anxious
pulse
beat
to
emulate
such
merit
a
generous
consciousness
of
measureless
inferiority
embarassed
him
with
a
confusion
so
amiable
that
wallace
who
perceived
his
extreme
youth
and
emotion
opened
his
arms
and
embraced
him
brave
youth
cried
he
i
trust
that
the
power
which
blesses
our
cause
will
enable
me
to
return
you
with
many
a
glory
to
the
bosom
of
your
family
edwin
was
encouraged
by
the
frank
address
of
a
hero
whom
he
expected
to
have
found
reserved
and
wrapped
in
the
deep
glooms
of
the
fate
which
had
roused
him
to
be
a
thunderbolt
of
heaven
but
when
he
saw
a
benign
though
pale
countenance
hail
him
with
smiles
he
made
a
strong
effort
to
shake
off
the
awe
with
which
the
name
and
the
dignity
of
figure
and
mein
of
wallace
had
oppressed
him
and
with
a
mantling
blush
he
replied
my
family
are
worthy
of
your
esteem
my
father
is
brave
but
my
mother
fearing
for
me
her
favorite
son
prevailed
on
him
to
put
me
into
a
monastery
dreading
the
power
of
the
english
even
there
she
allowed
none
but
the
abbot
to
know
who
i
was
and
as
he
chose
to
hide
my
name
and
i
have
burst
from
my
concealment
without
her
knowledge
till
i
do
something
worthy
of
that
name
and
deserving
her
pardon
permit
me
noble
wallace
to
follow
your
footsteps
by
the
simple
appellation
of
edwin
noble
boy
returned
the
chief
your
wish
shall
be
respected
we
urge
you
no
further
to
reveal
what
such
innate
bravery
must
shortly
proclaim
in
the
most
honorable
manner
the
whole
of
the
troop
having
ascended
while
their
wives
children
and
friends
were
rejoicing
in
their
embraces
wallace
asked
some
questions
relative
to
bothwell
and
murray
briefly
related
the
disasters
which
had
happened
there
my
father
added
he
is
still
with
the
lord
of
and
thither
i
sent
to
request
him
to
dispatch
to
the
cartlane
craigs
all
the
followers
he
took
with
him
into
argyleshire
but
as
things
are
would
it
not
be
well
to
send
a
second
messenger
to
say
that
you
have
sought
refuge
in
glenfinlass
before
he
could
arrive
returned
wallace
i
hope
we
shall
be
where
lord
bothwell
reinforcements
may
reach
us
by
water
our
present
object
must
be
the
earl
of
mar
he
is
the
first
scottish
earl
who
has
hazarded
his
estates
and
life
for
scotland
and
as
her
best
friend
his
liberation
must
be
our
first
enterprise
in
my
circuit
through
two
or
three
eastern
counties
a
promising
increase
has
been
made
to
our
little
army
the
frasers
of
oliver
castle
have
given
me
two
hundred
men
and
the
brave
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
whom
i
met
in
west
lothian
has
not
only
brought
fifty
stout
scots
to
my
command
but
as
hereditary
of
the
kingdom
has
come
himself
to
carry
the
royal
banner
of
scotland
to
glory
or
oblivion
to
glory
cried
murray
waving
his
sword
o
not
while
a
scot
survives
shall
that
again
lick
the
dust
lion
gules
in
a
field
or
is
the
arms
of
no
cried
kirkpatrick
his
eyes
flashing
fire
rather
may
every
scot
and
every
southron
fall
in
the
struggle
and
fill
one
grave
let
me
cried
he
sternly
grasping
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
looking
upward
let
me
oh
saviour
of
mankind
live
but
to
see
the
forth
and
the
clyde
so
often
reddened
with
our
blood
dye
the
eastern
and
the
western
oceans
with
the
vital
flood
of
these
our
foes
and
when
none
is
spared
then
let
me
die
in
peace
the
eyes
of
wallace
glanced
on
the
young
edwin
who
stood
gazing
on
kirkpatrick
and
turning
on
the
knight
with
a
powerful
look
of
check
that
prayer
cried
he
remember
my
brave
companion
what
the
saviour
of
mankind
was
and
then
think
whether
he
who
offered
life
to
all
the
world
will
listen
to
so
damning
an
invocation
if
we
would
be
blessed
in
the
contest
we
must
be
merciful
to
whom
exclaimed
kirkpatrick
to
the
robbers
who
tear
from
us
our
lands
to
the
ruffians
who
wrest
from
us
our
honors
but
you
are
patient
you
never
received
a
blow
yes
cried
wallace
turning
paler
a
heavy
one
on
my
heart
true
returned
kirkpatrick
your
wife
fell
dead
under
the
steel
of
a
southron
governor
and
you
slew
him
for
it
you
were
revenged
your
feelings
were
appeased
not
the
death
of
fifty
thousand
governors
replied
wallace
could
appease
my
feelings
revenge
were
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
yearnings
of
my
soul
for
a
moment
he
covered
his
agitated
features
with
his
hand
and
then
proceeded
i
slew
heselrigge
because
he
was
a
monster
under
whom
the
earth
groaned
my
sorrow
deep
as
it
was
was
but
one
of
many
which
his
rapacity
and
his
nephew
licentiousness
the
whole
nation
without
reserve
when
the
sword
of
war
is
drawn
all
who
resist
must
conquer
or
fall
but
there
are
some
noble
english
who
abhor
the
tyranny
they
are
obliged
to
exercise
over
us
and
when
they
declare
such
remorse
shall
they
not
find
mercy
at
our
hands
surely
if
not
for
humanity
for
policy
sake
we
ought
to
give
quarter
for
the
exterminating
sword
if
not
always
victorious
incurs
the
ruin
it
threatens
even
hope
that
by
or
righteous
cause
and
our
clemency
we
shall
not
only
gather
our
own
people
to
our
legions
but
turn
the
hearts
of
the
poor
welsh
and
the
misled
irish
whom
the
usurper
has
forced
into
his
armies
and
so
confront
him
with
troops
of
his
own
levying
many
of
the
english
were
too
just
to
share
in
the
subjugation
of
the
country
they
had
sworn
to
befriend
and
their
less
honorable
countrymen
when
they
see
scotsmen
no
longer
consenting
to
their
own
degradation
may
take
shame
to
themselves
for
assisting
to
betray
a
confiding
people
that
may
be
returned
kirkpatrick
but
surely
you
would
not
rank
aymer
de
valence
who
lords
it
over
dumbarton
and
cressingham
who
acts
the
tyrant
in
stirling
you
would
not
rank
them
amongst
these
conscientious
english
no
replied
wallace
the
haughty
oppression
of
the
one
and
the
wanton
cruelty
of
the
other
have
given
scotland
too
many
wounds
for
me
to
hold
a
shield
before
them
meet
them
and
i
leave
them
to
your
sword
and
by
heavens
cried
kirkpatrick
gnashing
his
teeth
with
the
fury
of
a
tiger
they
shall
know
its
point
wallace
then
informed
his
friends
he
purposed
marching
next
morning
by
daybreak
toward
dumbarton
castle
when
we
make
the
attack
said
he
it
must
be
in
the
night
for
i
propose
seizing
it
by
storm
murray
and
kirkpatrick
joyfully
acquiesced
edwin
smiled
an
enraptured
assent
and
wallace
with
many
a
gracious
look
and
speech
disengaged
himself
from
the
clinging
embraces
of
the
weaker
part
of
the
garrison
who
seeing
in
him
the
spring
of
their
husband
might
and
the
guard
of
their
own
safety
clung
to
him
as
to
a
presiding
deity
you
my
dear
countrywomen
said
he
shall
find
a
home
for
your
aged
parents
your
children
and
yourselves
with
the
venerable
sir
john
scott
of
loch
doine
you
are
to
be
conducted
thither
this
evening
and
there
await
in
comfort
the
happy
return
of
your
husbands
whom
providence
now
leads
forth
to
be
the
champions
of
your
country
filled
with
enthusiasm
the
women
uttered
a
shout
of
triumph
and
embracing
their
husbands
declared
they
were
ready
to
resign
them
wholly
to
heaven
and
sir
william
wallace
wallace
left
them
with
these
tender
relatives
from
whom
they
were
so
soon
to
part
and
retired
with
his
chieftains
to
arrange
the
plan
of
his
proposed
attack
delighted
with
the
glory
which
seemed
to
wave
to
him
from
the
pinnacles
of
dumbarton
rock
edwin
listened
in
profound
silence
to
all
that
was
said
and
then
hastened
to
his
quarters
to
prepare
his
armor
for
the
ensuing
morning
chapter
xx
the
cliffs
of
loch
lubnaig
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
while
the
young
chieftain
was
thus
employed
kenneth
entered
to
tell
him
that
sir
william
wallace
had
called
out
his
little
army
to
see
its
strength
and
numbers
soul
had
become
not
more
enamoured
of
the
panoply
of
war
than
the
gracious
smiles
of
his
admired
leader
and
at
this
intelligence
he
threw
his
plans
over
his
brigandine
and
placing
a
bonnet
on
his
brows
hastened
forth
to
meet
his
general

heights

echoed
with
thronging
footsteps
and
a
glittering
light
seemed
issuing
from
her
woods
as
the
rays
of
the
descending
sun
glanced
on
the
arms
of
her
assembling
warriors
the
thirty
followers
of
murray
appeared
just
as
the
two
hundred
frasers
entered
from
an
opening
in
the
rocks
blood
mounted
into
his
face
as
he
compared
his
inferior
numbers
and
recollected
the
obligation
they
were
to
repay
and
the
greater
one
he
was
now
going
to
incur
however
he
threw
the
standard
worked
by
helen
on
his
shoulder
and
turning
to
wallace
behold
cried
he
pointing
to
his
men
the
poor
man
mite
it
is
great
for
it
is
my
all
great
indeed
brave
murray
returned
wallace
for
it
brings
me
a
host
in
yourself
i
will
not
disgrace
my
standard
said
he
lowering
the
to
wallace
he
started
when
he
saw
the
flowing
lock
which
he
could
not
help
recognizing
this
is
my
betrothed
continued
murray
in
a
blither
tone
i
have
sworn
to
take
her
for
better
for
worse
and
i
pledge
you
my
truth
nothing
but
death
shall
part
us
wallace
grasped
his
hand
and
i
pledge
you
mine
that
the
head
whence
it
drew
shall
be
laid
low
before
i
suffer
so
generous
a
defender
to
be
separated
dead
or
alive
from
this
standard
his
eyes
glanced
at
the
empress
thou
art
right
continued
he
god
doth
goest
with
the
confidence
of
success
to
embrace
victory
as
a
bride
no
i
am
only
the
bridegroom
man
replied
murray
gayly
moving
off
i
shall
be
content
with
a
kiss
or
two
from
the
handmaids
and
leave
the
lady
for
my
general
happy
happy
youth
said
wallace
to
himself
as
his
eyes
pursued
the
agile
footsteps
of
the
young
chieftain
no
conquering
affection
has
yet
thrown
open
thy
heart
no
deadly
injury
hath
lacerated
it
with
wounds
incurable
patriotism
is
a
virgin
passion
in
thy
breast
and
innocence
and
joy
wait
upon
her
we
just
muster
five
hundred
men
observed
ker
to
wallace
but
they
are
all
stout
in
heart
as
in
condition
and
ready
even
if
you
will
it
to
commence
their
march
no
replied
wallace
we
must
not
overstrain
the
generous
spirit
let
them
rest
and
dawn
shall
light
us
through
the
forest
ker
who
acted
as
henchman
to
wallace
now
returned
to
the
ranks
to
give
the
word
and
they
marched
forward
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
with
his
golden
standard
charged
with
the
lion
of
scotland
led
the
van
wallace
raised
his
bonnet
from
his
head
as
it
drew
near
scrymgeour
lowered
the
staff
wallace
threw
up
his
outstretched
hand
at
this
action
but
the
knight
not
understanding
him
he
stepped
forward
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
cried
he
that
standard
must
now
bow
to
me
it
represents
the
royalty
of
scotland
before
which
we
fight
for
our
liberties
if
virtue
yet
dwell
in
the
house
of
the
valiant
david
some
of
his
offspring
will
hear
of
this
day
and
lead
it
forward
to
conquest
and
to
a
crown
till
such
an
hour
let
not
that
standard
bend
to
any
man
wallace
fell
back
as
he
spoke
and
scrymgeour
bowing
his
head
in
sign
of
acquiescence
marched
on
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
at
the
head
of
his
highlanders
next
advanced
his
banner
streamed
to
the
air
and
as
it
bent
to
wallace
he
saw
that
the
indignant
knight
had
adopted
the
device
of
the
hardy
king
archaius
but
with
a
fiercer
touch
and
i
pierce
king
of
scotland
took
for
his
device
the
thistle
and
the
rewe
and
for
his
motto
for
my
defense
that
man
thought
wallace
as
he
passed
along
carried
a
relentless
sword
in
his
very
eye
the
men
of
loch
doine
a
strong
tall
and
body
marched
on
and
gave
place
to
the
advancing
corps
of
bothwell
the
eye
of
wallace
felt
as
if
turning
from
gloom
and
horror
to
the
cheerful
light
of
day
when
it
fell
on
the
bright
and
indigenuous
face
of
murray
kenneth
with
his
troop
followed
and
the
youthful
edwin
like
cupid
in
arms
closed
the
procession
being
drawn
up
in
line
their
chief
fully
satisfied
advanced
toward
them
and
expressing
his
sentiments
of
the
patriotism
which
brought
them
into
the
field
informed
them
of
his
intended
march
he
then
turned
to
stephen
ireland
the
sun
has
now
set
said
he
and
before
dark
you
must
conduct
the
families
of
my
worthy
lanarkment
to
the
protection
of
sir
john
scott
it
is
time
that
age
infancy
and
female
weakness
should
cease
their
wanderings
with
us
we
bid
them
adieu
to
meet
them
again
by
the
leading
of
the
lord
of
hosts
in
freedom
and
prosperity
as
wallace
ceased
and
was
retiring
from
the
ground
several
old
men
and
young
women
with
their
babes
in
their
arms
rushed
from
behind
the
ranks
and
throwing
themselves
at
his
feet
caught
hold
of
his
hands
and
garments
we
go
said
the
venerable
fathers
to
pray
for
your
welfare
and
sure
we
are
a
crown
will
bless
our
country
benefactor
here
or
in
heaven
in
heaven
replied
wallace
shaking
the
plumes
of
his
bonnet
over
his
eyes
to
hide
the
moisture
which
suffused
them
i
can
have
no
right
to
any
other
crown
yes
cried
a
shepherd
you
free
your
country
from
tyrants
and
the
people
hearts
will
proclaim
their
deliverer
their
sovereign
may
your
rightful
monarch
worthy
patriarch
said
wallace
whether
a
bruce
of
a
baliol
meet
with
equal
zeal
from
scotland
at
large
and
tyranny
must
then
fall
before
courage
and
loyalty
the
women
wept
as
they
clung
to
his
hand
and
the
daughter
of
ireland
holding
up
her
child
in
her
arms
presented
it
to
him
look
on
my
son
cried
she
with
energy
the
first
word
he
speaks
shall
be
wallace
the
second
liberty
and
every
drop
of
milk
he
draws
from
my
bosom
shall
be
turned
into
blood
to
nerve
a
conquering
arm
or
to
flow
for
his
country
at
this
speech
all
the
women
held
up
their
children
toward
him
here
cried
they
we
devote
them
to
heaven
and
to
our
country
adopt
them
noble
wallace
to
be
thy
followers
in
arms
when
perhaps
their
fathers
are
laid
low
unable
to
speak
wallace
pressed
their
little
faces
separately
to
his
lips
then
returning
them
to
their
mothers
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
answered
in
an
agitated
voice
they
are
mine
weal
shall
be
theirs
my
woe
my
own
as
he
spoke
he
hurried
from
the
weeping
group
and
emerging
amid
the
cliffs
hid
himself
from
their
tears
and
their
blessing
he
threw
himself
on
a
shelving
rock
whose
bosom
projected
over
the
winding
waters
of
loch
lubnaig
and
having
stilled
his
own
anguished
recollections
he
turned
his
full
eyes
on
the
lake
beneath
and
while
he
contemplated
its
serene
surface
he
sighed
and
thought
how
tranquil
was
nature
till
the
rebellious
passions
of
man
wearying
of
innocent
joys
disturbed
all
by
restlessness
and
invasion
on
the
peace
and
happiness
of
others
the
mists
of
evening
hung
on
the
gigantic
tops
of
ben
ledi
and
ben
vorlich
then
sailing
forward
by
degrees
obscured
the
whole
of
the
mountains
leaving
nothing
for
the
eye
to
dwell
on
but
the
long
silent
expanse
of
the
waters
below
so
said
he
did
i
once
believe
myself
forever
shut
in
from
the
world
by
an
obscurity
that
promised
me
happiness
as
well
as
seclusion
but
the
hours
of
ellerslie
are
gone
no
tender
wife
will
now
twine
her
faithful
arms
around
my
neck
alas
the
angel
that
sunk
my
country
wrongs
to
a
dreamy
forgetfulness
in
her
arms
she
was
to
be
immolated
that
i
might
awake
my
wife
my
unborn
babe
they
must
both
bleed
for
scotland
the
sacrifice
shall
not
be
yielded
in
vain
no
blessed
god
cried
he
stretching
his
clasped
hands
toward
my
countrymen
to
liberty
and
happiness
let
me
counsel
with
thy
wisdom
let
me
conquer
with
thine
arm
and
when
all
is
finished
give
me
o
gracious
father
a
quiet
grave
beside
my
wife
and
child
tears
the
first
he
had
shed
since
the
hour
in
which
he
last
pressed
his
marion
to
his
heart
now
flowed
copiously
from
his
eyes
the
women
the
children
had
aroused
all
his
recollections
but
in
so
softened
a
train
that
they
melted
his
heart
till
he
wept
it
is
thy
just
tribute
marion
said
he
it
was
blood
you
shed
for
me
and
shall
i
check
these
poor
drops
look
on
me
sweet
saint
of
my
soul
o
hover
near
me
in
the
day
of
battle
and
thousands
of
thine
and
scotland
enemies
shall
fall
before
thy
husband
arm
the
plaintive
voice
of
the
highland
pipe
at
this
moment
broke
upon
his
ear
it
was
the
farewell
of
the
patriarch
lindsay
as
he
and
his
departing
company
descended
the
winding
paths
of
craignacoheilg
wallace
started
on
his
feet
the
separation
had
then
taken
place
between
his
trusty
followers
and
their
families
and
guessing
the
feelings
of
those
brave
men
from
what
was
passing
in
his
own
breast
he
dried
away
the
traces
of
his
tears
and
once
more
resuming
the
warrior
cheerful
look
sought
that
part
of
the
rock
where
the
lanarkmen
were
quartered
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
some
standing
on
the
cliff
and
others
leaning
over
to
catch
another
glance
of
the
departing
group
ere
it
was
lost
amid
the
shades
of
glenfinlass
are
they
quite
gone
asked
dugald
quite
answered
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
have
got
the
most
advantageous
situation
for
a
view
then
cried
he
may
andrew
keep
them
until
we
meet
again
may
a
greater
than
andrew
hear
thy
prayer
ejaculated
wallace
at
the
sound
of
this
response
from
their
chief
they
all
turned
round
my
brave
companions
said
he
i
come
to
repay
this
hour
pangs
by
telling
you
that
in
the
attack
of
dumbarton
you
shall
have
the
honor
of
first
mounting
the
walls
i
shall
be
at
your
head
to
sign
each
brave
soldier
with
a
patriot
seal
of
honor
to
follow
you
my
lord
said
dugald
is
our
duty
i
grant
it
replied
the
chief
and
as
i
am
the
leader
in
that
duty
it
is
mine
to
dispense
to
every
man
his
reward
to
prove
to
all
men
that
virtue
alone
is
true
nobility
ah
dearest
sir
exclaimed
edwin
who
had
been
assisting
the
women
to
carry
their
infants
down
the
steep
and
on
reascending
heard
the
latter
part
of
this
conversation
deprive
me
not
of
the
aim
of
my
life
these
warriors
have
had
you
long
have
distinguished
themselves
in
your
eyes
deprive
me
not
then
of
the
advantages
of
being
near
you
it
will
make
me
doubly
brave
oh
my
dear
commander
let
me
only
carry
to
the
grave
the
consciousness
that
next
to
yourself
i
was
the
first
to
mount
the
rock
of
dumbarton
and
you
will
make
me
noble
indeed
wallace
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
of
such
graciousness
that
the
youth
threw
himself
into
his
arms
you
will
grant
my
boon
i
will
noble
boy
said
he
act
up
to
your
sentiments
and
you
shall
be
my
brother
call
me
by
that
name
cried
edwin
and
i
will
dare
anything
then
be
the
first
to
follow
me
on
the
rock
said
he
and
i
will
lead
you
to
an
honor
the
highest
in
my
gift
you
shall
unloose
the
chains
of
the
earl
of
mar
and
ye
continued
he
commemorate
the
duty
of
such
sons
being
the
first
to
strike
the
blow
for
her
freedom
ye
shall
be
the
first
she
will
distinguish
i
now
speak
as
her
minister
and
as
a
badge
to
times
immemorial
i
bid
you
wear
the
scottish
lion
on
your
shields
a
shout
of
proud
joy
issued
from
every
heart
and
wallace
seeing
that
honor
had
dried
the
tears
of
regret
left
them
to
repose
he
sent
edwin
to
his
rest
and
himself
avoiding
the
other
chieftains
retired
to
his
own
chamber
in
the
tower
chapter
xxi
loch
lomond
profound
as
was
the
rest
of
wallace
yet
the
first
clarion
of
the
lark
awakened
him
the
rosy
dawn
shone
in
at
the
window
and
a
fresh
breeze
wooed
him
with
its
inspiring
breath
to
rise
and
meet
it
but
the
impulse
was
in
his
own
mind
he
needed
nothing
outward
to
call
him
to
action
rising
immediately
he
put
on
his
glittering
hauberk
and
issuing
from
the
tower
raised
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blew
so
rousing
a
blast
that
in
an
instant
the
whole
rock
was
covered
with
soldiers
wallace
placed
his
helmet
on
his
head
and
advanced
toward
them
just
as
edwin
had
joined
him
and
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
appeared
from
the
tower
blessed
be
this
morn
cried
the
old
knight
my
sword
springs
from
its
scabbard
to
meet
it
and
ere
its
good
steel
be
sheathed
again
continued
he
shaking
it
sternly
what
deaths
may
dye
its
point
wallace
shuddered
at
the
ferocity
with
which
his
colleague
contemplated
this
feature
of
war
from
which
every
humane
soldier
would
seek
to
turn
his
thoughts
that
he
might
encounter
it
with
the
steadiness
of
a
man
and
not
the
irresolution
of
a
woman
to
hail
the
field
of
blood
with
the
fierceness
of
a
hatred
eager
for
the
slaughter
of
its
victim
to
know
any
joy
in
combat
but
that
each
contest
might
render
another
less
necessary
did
not
enter
into
the
imagination
of
wallace
until
he
had
heard
and
seen
the
infuriate
kirkpatrick
he
talked
of
the
coming
battle
with
horrid
rapture
and
told
the
young
edwin
he
should
that
day
see
loch
lomond
red
with
english
blood
offended
at
such
savageness
but
without
answering
him
wallace
drew
toward
murray
and
calling
to
edwin
ordered
him
to
march
at
his
side
the
youth
seemed
glad
of
the
summons
and
wallace
was
pleased
to
observe
it
as
he
thought
that
a
longer
stay
with
one
who
so
grossly
overcharged
the
feelings
of
honest
patriotism
might
breed
disgust
in
his
innocent
mind
against
a
cause
which
had
so
furious
and
therefore
unjust
a
defender
justice
and
mercy
ever
dwell
together
said
he
to
edwin
who
now
drew
near
him
for
universal
love
is
the
parent
of
justice
as
well
as
of
mercy
but
implacable
revenge
whence
did
she
spring
but
from
the
head
of
satan
himself
though
their
cause
appeared
the
same
never
were
two
spirits
more
discordant
than
those
of
wallace
and
kirkpatrick
but
kirkpatrick
did
not
so
soon
discover
the
dissimilarity
as
it
is
easier
for
purity
to
descry
its
opposite
than
for
foulness
to
apprehend
that
anything
can
be
purer
than
itself
the
forces
being
marshaled
according
to
the
preconcerted
order
the
three
commanders
with
wallace
at
their
head
led
forward
they
passed
through
the
forest
of
glenfinlass
and
morning
and
evening
still
found
them
threading
its
unsuspected
solitudes
in
unmolested
security
night
too
watched
their
onward
march
the
sun
had
just
risen
as
the
little
band
of
patriots
the
hope
of
freedom
emerged
upon
the
eastern
bank
of
loch
lomond
the
bases
of
the
mountains
were
yet
covered
with
the
dispersing
mist
of
the
morning
and
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
which
lashed
the
shore
the
sheep
bleated
from
the
hills
and
the
umbrageous
herbage
dropping
dew
seemed
glittering
with
a
thousand
fairy
gems
where
is
the
man
who
would
not
fight
for
such
a
country
exclaimed
murray
as
he
stepped
over
a
bridge
of
interwoven
trees
which
crossed
one
of
the
mountain
streams
this
land
was
not
made
for
slaves
look
at
these
bulwarks
of
nature
every
which
forms
this
chain
of
hills
is
an
impregnable
rampart
against
invasion
if
baliol
had
possessed
but
half
a
heart
edward
might
have
returned
even
worse
than
caesar
without
a
cockle
to
decorate
his
helmet
baliol
has
found
the
oblivion
he
incurred
returned
wallace
his
son
perhaps
may
better
deserve
the
scepter
of
such
a
country
let
us
cut
the
way
and
he
who
merits
the
crown
will
soon
appear
to

it

not

edward
baliol
rejoined
scrymgeour
during
the
inconsistent
reign
of
his
father
i
once
carried
a
despatch
to
him
from
scotland
he
was
then
banqueting
in
all
the
luxuries
of
the
english
court
and
such
a
voluptuary
i
never
beheld
i
left
the
scene
of
folly
only
praying
that
so
effeminate
a
prince
might
never
disgrace
the
throne
of
our
manly
race
of
kings
if
such
be
the
tuition
of
our
lords
in
the
court
of
edward
and
wise
is
the
policy
for
his
own
views
observed
ker
what
can
we
expect
from
even
the
bruce
they
were
ever
a
nobler
race
than
the
baliol
but
bad
education
and
luxury
will
debase
the
most
princely
minds
i
saw
neither
of
the
bruce
when
i
visited
london
replied
scrymgeour
the
earl
of
carrick
was
at
his
house
in
cleveland
and
robert
bruce
his
eldest
son
with
the
english
army
in
guienne
but
they
bore
a
manly
character
particularly
young
robert
to
whom
the
troubadours
of
aquitaine
have
given
the
flattering
appellation
of
prince
of
chivalry
it
would
be
more
to
his
honor
interrupted
murray
if
he
compelled
the
english
to
acknowledge
him
as
prince
of
scotland
with
so
much
bravery
how
can
he
allow
such
a
civetcat
as
edward
baliol
to
bear
away
the
title
which
is
his
by
the
double
right
of
blood
and
virtue
perhaps
said
wallace
the
young
lion
only
sleeps
the
time
may
come
when
both
he
and
his
father
will
rise
from
their
lethargy
and
throw
themselves
at
once
into
the
arms
of
scotland
to
stimulate
the
dormant
patriotism
of
these
two
princes
by
showing
them
a
subject
leading
their
people
to
liberty
is
one
great
end
of
the
victories
i
seek
none
other
than
a
brave
king
can
bind
the
various
interests
of
this
distracted
country
into
one
and
therefore
for
fair
sake
my
heart
turns
toward
the
bruces
with
most
anxious
hopes
for
my
part
cried
murray
i
have
always
thought
the
lady
we
will
not
woo
we
have
no
right
to
pretend
to
if
the
bruces
will
not
be
at
the
pains
to
snatch
scotland
from
drowning
i
see
no
reason
for
making
them
a
present
of
what
will
cost
us
many
a
wet
jacket
before
we
tug
her
from
the
waves
he
that
wins
the
day
ought
to
wear
the
laurel
and
so
once
for
all
i
proclaim
him
king
of
good
old
albin
who
will
have
the
glory
of
driving
her
oppressors
beyond
her
dikes
was
the
ancient
name
of
scotland
wallace
did
not
hear
this
last
sentiment
of
murray
as
it
was
spoken
in
a
lowered
voice
in
the
ear
of
kirkpatrick
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
was
the
knight
reply
and
in
the
true
roman
style
may
the
death
of
every
southron
now
in
scotland
and
as
many
more
as
fate
chooses
to
yield
us
be
the
preliminary
games
of
his
coronation
wallace
who
heard
this
turned
to
kirkpatrick
with
a
mild
rebuke
in
his
eye
balaam
blessed
when
he
meant
to
curse
said
he
but
some
curse
when
they
mean
to
bless
such
prayers
are
blasphemy
for
can
we
expect
a
blessing
on
our
arms
when
all
our
invocations
are
for
vengeance
rather
than
victory
blood
for
blood
is
only
justice
returned
murray
and
how
can
you
noble
wallace
as
a
scot
and
as
a
man
imply
any
mercy
to
the
villains
who
stab
us
to
the
heart
i
plead
not
for
them
replied
wallace
but
for
the
poor
wretches
who
follow
their
leaders
by
force
to
the
field
of
scotland
i
would
not
inflict
on
them
the
cruelties
we
now
resent
it
is
not
to
aggrieve
but
to
redress
that
we
carry
arms
if
we
make
not
this
distinction
we
turn
courage
into
a
crime
and
plant
disgrace
instead
of
honor
upon
the
warrior
brow
i
do
not
understand
commiserating
the
wolves
who
have
so
long
made
havoc
in
our
country
cried
kirkpatrick
methinks
such
maidenly
mercy
is
rather
or
of
place
wallace
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
i
will
answer
you
my
valiant
friend
by
adopting
your
own
figure
it
is
that
these
southron
wolves
may
not
confound
us
with
themselves
that
i
wish
to
show
in
our
conduct
rather
the
generous
ardor
of
the
faithful
guardian
of
the
fold
than
the
rapacious
fierceness
which
equals
them
with
the
beasts
of
the
desert
as
we
are
men
and
scots
let
the
burden
of
our
prayers
be
the
preservation
of
our
country
not
the
slaughter
of
our
enemies
the
one
is
an
ambition
with
which
angels
may
sympathize
the
other
a
horrible
desire
which
speaks
the
nature
of
fiends
in
some
cases
this
may
be
replied
sir
roger
a
little
reconciled
to
the
argument
but
not
in
mine
my
injury
yet
burns
upon
my
cheek
and
as
nothing
but
the
life
blood
of
cressingham
can
quench
it
i
will
listen
no
more
to
your
doctrine
till
i
am
avenged
that
done
i
shall
not
forget
your
lesson
generous
kirkpatrick
exclaimed
wallace
nothing
that
is
really
cruel
can
dwell
with
such
manly
candor
say
what
you
will
i
can
trust
your
heart
after
this
moment
they
had
crossed
the
river
ennerie
and
were
issuing
from
between
its
narrow
ridge
of
hills
when
wallace
pointing
to
a
stupendous
rock
which
rose
in
solitary
magnificence
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
plain
exclaimed
there
is
dumbarton
castle
citadel
holds
the
fetters
of
scotland
and
if
we
break
them
there
every
minor
link
will
easily
give
way
the
men
uttered
a
shout
of
anticipated
triumph
at
this
sight
and
proceeding
soon
came
in
view
of
the
fortifications
which
helmeted
the
rock
as
they
approached
they
discovered
that
it
had
two
summits
being
in
a
manner
cleft
in
twain
the
one
side
rising
in
a
pyramidal
form
while
the
other
of
a
more
sustained
the
ponderous
buildings
of
the
fortress
it
was
dusk
when
the
little
army
arrived
in
the
rear
of
a
close
thicket
to
a
considerable
length
over
the
plain
on
this
spot
wallace
rested
his
men
and
while
they
placed
themselves
under
its
covert
till
the
appointed
time
of
attack
he
perceived
through
an
opening
in
the
wood
the
gleaming
of
soldiers
arms
on
the
ramparts
and
fires
beginning
to
light
on
a
lonely
watchtower
which
crowned
the
pinnacle
of
the
highest
rock
poor
fools
exclaimed
murray
like
the
rest
of
their
brethren
of
clay
they
look
abroad
for
evils
and
prepare
not
for
those
which
are
even
at
their
doors
that
cried
scrymgeour
shall
light
us
to
their
chambers
and
for
once
we
thank
them
for
their
providence
that
whispered
edwin
to
wallace
shall
light
me
to
honor
by
your
agreement
i
shall
call
you
brother
or
lie
dead
on
the
summit
of
those
walls
edwin
said
wallace
act
as
you
say
and
deserve
not
only
to
be
called
my
brother
but
to
be
the
first
banneret
of
freedom
in
arms
he
then
turned
toward
the
lines
and
giving
his
orders
to
each
division
directed
them
to
seek
repose
on
the
surrounding
heather
till
the
now
glowing
moon
should
have
sunk
her
telltale
light
in
the
waves
chapter
xxii
dumbarton
rock
all
obeyed
the
voice
of
their
commander
and
retired
to
rest
but
the
eyes
of
edwin
could
not
close
his
eager
spirit
was
already
on
the
walls
of
dumbarton
his
rapid
mind
anticipated
the
ascent
of
his
general
and
his
troop
but
an
imagination
no
less
just
than
ardent
suggested
the
difficulties
attending
so
small
a
force
assailing
so
formidable
a
garrison
without
some
immediate
knowledge
of
its
relative
situations
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
he
would
mount
that
rock
alone
he
would
seek
to
ascertain
the
place
of
lord
mar
confinement
that
not
one
life
in
wallace
faithful
band
might
be
lost
in
a
vague
search
ah
my
general
exclaimed
he
edwin
shall
be
the
first
to
spring
those
ramparts
he
shall
tread
that
dangerous
path
alone
and
when
he
has
thus
proved
himself
no
unworthy
of
thy
confidence
he
will
return
to
lead
thee
and
thy
soldiers
to
a
sure
victory
and
himself
to
honor
by
thy
side
this
fervant
apostrophe
breathed
to
the
night
alone
was
no
sooner
uttered
than
he
stole
from
the
thicket
into
which
he
had
cast
himself
to
respose
he
looked
toward
the
embattled
cliff
its
summit
stood
bright
in
the
moonlight
but
deep
shadows
lay
beneath
god
be
my
speed
cried
he
and
wrapping
himself
in
his
plaid
so
mixed
its
dark
hues
with
the
weeds
and
herbage
at
the
base
of
the
rock
that
he
made
its
circuit
without
having
attracted
observation
the
south
side
seemed
the
easiest
of
ascent
and
by
that
he
began
his
daring
attempt
having
gained
the
height
he
clambered
behind
a
buttress
the
shadow
of
which
cast
the
wall
into
such
black
obscurity
that
he
crept
safely
through
one
of
its
crenelles
and
dropping
gently
inward
alighted
on
his
feet
still
keeping
the
shadowed
side
of
the
battlements
he
proceeded
cautiously
along
and
so
still
was
his
motion
that
he
passed
undiscovered
even
by
the
sentinels
who
guarded
this
quarter
of
the
fortress
he
soon
arrived
at
the
open
square
before
the
citadel
it
was
yet
occupied
by
groups
of
southron
officers
gayly
walking
to
and
fro
under
the
light
of
the
moon
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
useful
information
from
their
discourse
he
concealed
himself
behind
a
chest
of
arrows
and
as
they
passed
backward
and
forward
distinctly
heard
them
jesting
each
other
about
divers
fair
dames
of
the
country
around
the
conversation
terminated
in
a
debate
whether
or
no
the
indifference
which
their
governor
de
valence
manifested
to
the
majestic
beauties
of
the
countess
of
mar
were
real
or
assumed
a
thousand
free
remarks
were
made
on
the
subject
and
edwin
gathered
sufficient
from
the
discourse
to
understand
that
the
earl
and
countess
were
treated
severely
and
confined
in
a
large
square
tower
in
the
cleft
of
the
rock
having
learned
all
that
he
could
expect
from
these
officers
he
speeded
under
the
friendly
shadow
toward
the
other
side
of
the
citadel
and
arrived
just
as
the
guard
approached
to
relieve
the
sentinels
of
the
northern
postern
he
laid
himself
close
to
the
ground
and
happily
overheard
the
word
of
the
night
as
it
was
given
to
the
new
watch
this
providential
circumstances
saved
his
life
finding
no
mode
of
egress
from
this
place
but
by
the
postern
at
which
the
sentinel
was
stationed
or
by
attempting
a
passage
through
a
small
adjoining
tower
the
door
of
which
stood
open
he
considered
a
moment
and
then
deciding
for
the
tower
stole
unobserved
into
it
fortunately
no
person
was
there
but
edwin
found
it
full
of
spare
arms
with
two
or
three
vacant
couches
in
different
corners
where
he
supposed
the
officers
on
guard
occassionally
reposed
several
lay
on
the
floor
he
readily
apprehended
the
use
he
might
make
of
this
circumstance
and
throwing
one
of
them
over
his
shoulders
climbed
to
a
large
embrasure
in
the
wall
and
forcing
himself
through
it
dropped
to
a
declivity
on
the
other
side
which
shelved
down
to
the
cliff
wherein
he
saw
the
square
tower
he
had
scarcely
alighted
on
firm
ground
when
a
sentinel
followed
by
two
others
presented
pikes
approached
him
and
demanded
the
word
montjoy
was
his
reply
why
leap
the
embrasure
said
one
why
not
enter
by
the
postern
demanded
another
the
conversation
of
the
officers
had
given
him
a
hint
on
which
he
had
formed
his
answer
love
my
brave
comrades
replied
he
seldom
chooses
even
ways
i
go
on
a
message
from
a
young
ensign
in
the
keep
to
one
of
the
scottish
damsels
in
yonder
tower
delay
me
and
his
vengeance
will
fall
upon
us
all
good
luck
to
you
my
lad
was
their
answer
and
with
a
lightened
step
he
hastened
toward
the
tower
not
deeming
it
safe
to
seek
an
interview
with
any
of
the
earl
family
he
crept
along
the
base
of
the
structure
and
across
the
works
till
he
reached
the
high
wall
that
blocks
up
egress
from
the
north
he
found
this
formidable
curtain
constructed
of
fragments
of
rock
and
for
the
convenience
of
the
guard
a
sloping
platform
from
within
led
to
the
top
of
the
wall
on
the
other
side
it
was
perpendicular
a
solitary
sentinel
stood
there
and
how
to
pass
him
was
edwin
next
device
to
attack
him
would
be
desparate
being
one
of
a
chain
of
guards
around
the
interior
of
the
fortress
his
voice
need
only
to
be
raised
in
the
least
to
call
a
regiment
to
his
assistance
and
edwin
might
be
seized
on
the
instant
aware
of
his
danger
but
not
dismayed
the
adventurous
youth
bethought
him
of
his
former
excuse
and
remembering
a
flask
of
spirits
which
ireland
had
put
into
his
pouch
on
leaving
glenfinlass
he
affected
to
be
intoxicated
and
staggering
up
to
the
man
accosted
him
in
the
character
of
a
servant
of
the
garrison
the
sentinel
did
not
doubt
the
appearance
of
the
boy
and
edwin
holding
out
the
flask
said
that
a
pretty
girl
in
the
great
tower
had
not
only
given
him
a
long
draught
of
the
same
good
liquor
but
had
filled
his
bottle
that
he
might
not
lack
amusement
while
her
companion
one
of
lady
mar
was
tying
up
a
true
lover
knot
to
send
to
his
master
in
the
garrison
the
man
believed
edwin
tale
and
the
more
readily
as
he
thrust
the
flask
into
his
hand
and
bade
him
drink
do
not
spare
it
cried
he
the
night
is
chilly
and
i
shall
get
more
where
that
came
from
the
unsuspecting
southron
returned
him
a
merry
reply
and
putting
the
flask
to
his
head
soon
drained
its
contents
they
had
the
effect
edwin
desired
the
soldier
became
flustered
and
impatient
of
his
duty
edwin
perceived
it
and
yawning
complained
of
drowsiness
i
would
go
to
the
top
of
that
wall
and
sleep
sweetly
in
the
moonbeams
said
he
if
any
goodnatured
fellow
would
meanwhile
wait
for
my
pretty
scot
the
southron
liked
no
better
sport
and
regardless
of
duty
he
promised
to
draw
nearer
the
tower
and
bring
from
the
fair
messenger
the
expected
token
having
thus
far
gained
his
point
with
an
apparently
staggering
but
really
agile
step
edwin
ascended
the
wall
a
leap
from
this
dizzy
height
was
his
only
way
to
rejoin
wallace
to
retread
his
steps
through
the
fortress
in
safety
would
hardly
be
possible
and
besides
such
a
mode
of
retreat
would
leave
him
uninformed
on
the
second
object
of
his
know
the
most
vulnerable
side
of
the
fortress
he
threw
himself
along
the
summit
of
the
wall
as
if
to
sleep
he
looked
down
and
saw
nothing
but
the
blackness
of
space
for
here
the
broad
expanse
of
shadow
rendered
rocks
and
building
of
the
same
hue
and
level
but
hope
buoyed
him
in
her
arms
and
turning
his
eyes
toward
the
sentinel
he
observed
him
to
have
arrived
within
a
few
paces
of
the
square
tower
this
was
edwin
moment
grasping
the
projecting
stone
of
the
embattlement
and
commending
himself
to
heaven
he
threw
himself
from
its
summit
and
fell
a
fearful
depth
to
the
cliffs
beneath
meanwhile
wallace
having
seen
his
brave
followers
depart
to
their
respose
reclined
himself
along
a
pile
of
moss
grown
stones
which
in
the
days
of
the
renowned
fingal
had
covered
the
body
of
some
valiant
morven
chieftain
he
fixed
his
wakeful
eyes
on
the
castle
now
illumined
in
every
part
by
the
fullness
of
the
moon
luster
and
considered
which
point
would
be
most
assailable
by
the
he
had
prepared
every
side
seemed
a
precipice
the
leven
surrounding
it
on
the
north
and
the
west
the
clyde
broad
as
a
sea
on
the
south
the
only
place
that
seemed
at
all
accessible
was
the
side
next
the
dike
behind
which
he
lay
here
the
ascent
to
the
castellated
part
of
the
rock
because
most
perpendicular
was
the
least
guarded
with
outworks
and
by
this
he
determined
to
make
the
attempt
as
soon
as
the
setting
moon
should
involve
the
garrison
in
darkness
while
he
yet
mused
on
what
might
be
the
momentous
consequences
of
the
succeeding
midnight
hours
he
thought
he
heard
a
swift
though
cautious
footstep
he
raised
himself
and
laying
his
hands
on
his
sword
saw
a
figure
advancing
toward
him
who
goes
there
demanded
wallace
a
faithful
scot
was
the
reply
wallace
recognized
the
voice
of
edwin
what
has
disturbed
you
why
do
you
not
take
rest
with
the
others
that
we
may
have
it
the
surer
replied
the
youth
i
am
just
returned
from
the
summit
of
yonder
rock
how
interrupted
wallace
have
you
scaled
it
alone
and
are
returned
in
safety
wallace
caught
him
in
his
arms
intrepid
glorious
boy
tell
me
for
what
purpose
did
you
thus
hazard
your
precious
life
i
wished
to
learn
its
most
pregnable
part
replied
edwin
his
young
heart
beating
with
triumph
at
these
encomiums
from
his
commander
and
particularly
where
the
good
earl
is
confined
that
we
might
make
our
attack
directly
to
the
point
and
have
you
been
successful
demanded
wallace
i
have
was
his
answer
lord
mar
and
his
lady
are
kept
in
a
square
tower
which
stands
in
the
cleft
between
the
two
summits
of
the
rock
it
is
not
only
surrounded
by
embattled
walls
which
flank
the
ponderous
buttresses
of
this
huge
dungeon
but
the
space
on
which
it
stands
is
bulwarked
at
each
end
by
a
stone
curtain
of
fifteen
feet
high
guarded
by
turrets
full
of
armed
men
and
yet
by
that
side
you
suppose
we
must
ascend
said
wallace
certainly
for
if
you
attempt
it
on
the
west
we
should
have
to
scale
the
cliff
and
the
ascent
could
only
be
gained
in
file
an
auxiliary
detachment
to
attack
in
flank
might
succeed
there
but
the
passage
being
so
narrow
would
be
too
tedious
for
the
whole
party
to
arrive
in
time
should
we
take
the
south
we
must
cut
through
the
whole
garrison
before
we
could
reach
the
earl
and
on
this
side
the
morass
lies
too
near
the
foot
of
the
rock
to
admit
an
approach
without
the
greatest
danger
but
on
the
north
where
i
descended
by
wading
through
part
of
the
leven
and
climbing
from
cliff
to
cliff
i
have
every
hope
you
may
succeed
edwin
recounted
the
particulars
of
his
progress
through
the
fortress
and
by
the
minuteness
of
his
topographical
descriptions
enforced
his
arguments
for
the
north
to
be
the
point
assailed
closing
his
narrative
he
explained
to
the
anxious
inquiry
of
wallace
how
he
had
escaped
accident
in
a
leap
of
so
many
feet
the
wall
was
covered
with
ivy
he
caught
by
its
branches
in
his
descent
and
at
last
happily
fell
amongst
a
thick
bed
of
furze
after
this
he
clambered
down
the
steep
and
fording
the
leven
there
only
knee
deep
now
appeared
before
his
general
elate
in
heart
and
bright
in
valor
the
intrepidity
of
this
action
returned
wallace
glowing
with
admiration
at
so
noble
a
daring
in
so
young
a
creature
merits
that
every
confidence
should
be
placed
in
the
result
of
your
observations
your
safe
return
is
a
pledge
of
our
design
being
approved
and
when
we
go
in
the
strength
of
heaven
who
can
doubt
the
issue
this
night
when
the
lord
of
battles
puts
that
fortress
into
our
hands
before
the
whole
of
our
little
army
you
shall
receive
that
knighthood
you
have
so
richly
deserved
such
my
truly
dear
brother
my
noble
edwin
shall
be
the
reward
of
your
virtue
and
your
toil
wallace
would
now
have
sent
him
to
respose
himself
but
animated
by
the
success
of
his
adventure
and
exulting
in
the
honor
which
was
so
soon
to
stamp
a
sign
of
this
exploit
upon
him
forever
he
told
his
leader
that
he
felt
no
want
of
sleep
and
would
rather
take
on
him
the
office
of
arousing
the
other
captains
to
their
stations
the

their
preconcerted
signal

approaching
its

the
fortress
kirkpatrick
murray
and
scrymgeour
hastened
to
their
commander
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
were
under
arms
wallace
briefly
explained
his
altered
plan
of
assault
and
marshaling
his
men
accordingly
led
them
in
silence
through
the
water
and
along
the
beach
which
lay
between
the
rock
and
the
leven
arriving
at
the
base
just
as
the
moon
set
they
began
to
ascend
to
do
this
in
the
dark
redoubled
the
difficulty
but
as
wallace
had
the
place
of
every
accessible
stone
accurately
described
to
him
by
edwin
he
went
confidently
forward
followed
by
his
lanarkmen
he
and
they
being
the
first
to
mount
fixed
and
held
the
tops
of
the
while
kirkpatrick
and
scrymgeour
with
their
men
gradually
ascended
and
gained
the
bottom
of
the
wall
here
planting
themselves
in
the
crannies
of
the
rock
under
the
impenetrable
darkness
of
the
night
for
the
moon
had
not
only
set
but
the
stars
were
obscured
by
clouds
they
awaited
the
signal
for
the
final
ascent
meanwhile
edwin
led
lord
andrew
with
his
followers
and
the
fraser
men
round
by
the
western
side
to
mount
the
watchtower
rock
and
seize
the
few
soldiers
who
kept
the
beacon
as
a
signal
of
having
succeeded
they
were
to
smother
the
flame
on
the
top
of
the
tower
and
thence
descend
toward
the
garrison
to
meet
wallace
before
the
prison
of
the
earl
of
mar
while
the
men
of
lanark
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
burning
beacon
in
deadly
stillness
watched
the
appointed
signal
for
the
attack
wallace
by
the
aid
of
his
dagger
which
he
struck
into
the
firm
soil
that
occupied
the
cracks
in
the
rock
drew
himself
up
almost
parallel
with
the
top
of
the
great
wall
which
clasped
the
bases
of
the
two
hills
he
listened
not
a
voice
was
to
be
heard
in
the
garrison
of
all
the
legions
he
had
so
lately
seen
glittering
on
its
battlements
it
was
an
awful
pause
now
was
the
moment
when
scotland
was
to
make
her
first
essay
for
freedom
should
it
fail
ten
thousand
bolts
of
iron
would
be
added
to
her
chains
should
it
succeed
liberty
and
happiness
were
the
almost
certain
consequences
he
looked
up
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
thought
he
saw
the
figures
of
men
pass
before
it
the
next
moment
all
was
darkness
he
sprung
on
the
walls
and
feeling
by
the
touch
of
hands
about
his
feet
that
his
brave
followers
had
already
mounted
their
ladders
he
grasped
his
sword
firmly
and
leaped
down
on
the
ground
within
in
that
moment
he
struck
against
the
sentinel
who
was
just
passing
and
by
the
violence
of
the
shock
struck
him
to
the
earth
but
the
man
as
he
fell
catching
wallace
round
the
waist
dragged
him
after
him
and
with
a
vociferous
cry
shouted
treason
several
sentinels
ran
with
leveled
pikes
to
the
spot
the
adjacent
turrets
emptied
themselves
of
their
armed
inhabitants
and
all
assaulted
wallace
just
as
he
had
extricated
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
prostrate
soldier
who
are
you
demanded
they
your
enemy
and
the
speaker
fell
at
his
feet
with
one
stroke
of
his
sword
alarm
resounded
from
the
rest
as
they
aimed
their
random
strokes
at
the
conquering
chief
but
he
was
now
assisted
by
the
vigorous
army
of
ker
and
of
several
lanarkmen
who
having
cleared
the
wall
were
dealing
about
blows
in
the
darkness
which
filled
the
air
with
groans
and
strewed
the
ground
with
the
dying
and
the
dead
one
or
two
southrons
whose
courage
was
not
equal
to
their
caution
fled
to
arouse
the
garrison
and
just
as
the
whole
of
wallace
men
leaped
the
wall
and
rallied
to
his
support
the
inner
ballium
gate
burst
open
and
a
legion
of
foes
bearing
torches
issued
to
the
contest
with
horrible
threatenings
they
came
on
and
by
a
rapid
movement
surrounded
wallace
and
his
little
company
but
his
soul
brightened
in
danger
and
his
men
warmed
with
the
same
spirit
stood
firm
with
fixed
pikes
receiving
without
injury
the
assault
their
weapons
being
longer
than
their
enemy
the
southrons
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
rushed
upon
their
points
incurring
the
death
they
meant
to
give
seeing
their
consequent
disorder
wallace
ordered
the
pikes
to
be
dropped
and
his
men
to
charge
sword
in
hand
terrible
was
now
the
havoc
for
the
desperate
scots
grapling
each
to
his
foe
with
a
fatal
hold
let
not
go
till
the
piercing
shriek
or
the
agonized
groan
convinced
him
that
death
had
seized
its
victim
wallace
fought
in
front
making
a
dreadful
passage
through
the
falling
ranks
while
the
tremendous
sweep
of
his
sword
flashing
in
the
intermitting
light
warned
the
survivors
where
the
avenging
blade
would
next
descend
a
horrid
vacuity
was
made
in
the
lately
thronged
spot
it
seemed
not
the
slaughter
of
a
mortal
arm
but
as
if
the
destroying
angel
himself
were
there
and
with
one
blast
of
his
desolating
brand
had
laid
all
in
ruin
the
platform
was
cleared
and
the
fallen
torches
some
and
other
flaming
on
the
ground
by
the
sides
of
the
dead
showed
in
their
uncertain
gleams
a
few
terrified
wretches
seeking
safely
in
flight
the
same
lurid
rays
casting
a
transitory
light
on
the
iron
gratings
of
the
great
tower
informed
wallace
that
the
heat
of
conflict
had
drawn
him
to
the
prison
of
the
earl
we
are
now
near
the
end
of
this
night
work
cried
he
let
us
press
forward
to
give
freedom
to
the
earl
of
mar
liberty
and
lord
mar
cried
kirkpatrick
rushing
onward
he
was
immediately
followed
by
his
own
men
but
not
quickly
enough
for
his
daring
the
guard
in
the
tower
hearing
the
outcry
issued
from
the
flanking
gates
and
surrounding
him
took
him
prisoner
if
there
be
might
in
your
arms
roared
he
with
the
voice
of
a
lion
men
of
loch
dione
rescue
your
leader
they
hurried
forward
with
yells
of
defiance
but
the
strength
of
the
garrison
awakened
by
the
flying
wretches
from
the
defeat
turned
out
all
its
power
and
with
de
valence
at
their
head
poured
on
kirkpatrick
men
and
would
have
overpowered
them
had
not
wallace
and
his
sixty
heroes
with
desperate
determination
cut
a
passage
to
them
through
the
closing
ranks
pikes
struck
against
corslets
swords
rang
on
helmets
and
the
ponderous
falling
with
the
weight
of
fate
cleft
the
uplifted
target
in
twain
blood
spouted
on
every
side
and
the
dripping
hands
of
kirkpatrick
as
wallace
tore
him
from
the
enemy
proclaimed
that
he
had
bathed
his
vengeance
in
the
stream
on
being
released
he
shook
his
ensanguined
arms
and
burst
into
a
horrid
laugh
the
work
speeds
now
through
the
heart
of
the
governor
even
while
he
spoke
wallace
lost
him
again
from
his
side
and
again
by
the
shouts
of
the
southrons
who
cried
no
quarter
for
the
rebel
he
learned
he
must
be
retaken
that
merciless
cry
was
the
of
their
own
doom
it
directed
wallace
to
the
spot
and
throwing
himself
and
his
brethren
of
lanark
into
the
midst
of
the
band
which
held
the
prisoner
kirkpatrick
was
again
rescued
but
thousands
seemed
now
surrounding
the
chief
himself
to
do
this
generous
deed
he
had
advanced
further
than
he
ought
and
himself
and
his
brave
followers
must
have
been
slain
had
he
not
recoiled
and
covering
their
rear
with
the
great
tower
all
who
had
the
hardihood
to
approach
fell
under
the
weight
of
the
scottish
claymore
scrymgeour
at
the
head
of
the
loch
dione
men
in
vain
attempted
to
reach
this
contending
party
and
fearful
of
losing
the
royal
standard
he
was
turning
to
make
a
valiant
retreat
when
murray
and
edwin
having
disengaged
their
followers
from
the
precipices
of
the
beacon
rock
rushed
into
the
fray
striking
their
shields
and
uttering
the
inspiring
slogan
of
wallace
and
freedom
it
was
by
every
scot
those
that
were
flying
returned
they
who
sustained
the
conflict
hailed
the
cry
with
braces
sinews
and
the
terrible
thunder
of
the
word
pealing
from
rank
to
rank
struck
a
terror
into
de
valence
men
which
made
them
pause
the
extinction
of
the
beacon
made
them
still
more
aghast
on
that
short
moment
turned
the
crisis
of
their
fate
wallace
cut
his
way
forward
through
the
dismayed
southrons
who
bearing
the
reiterated
shouts
of
the
fresh
reinforcements
knew
not
whether
its
strength
might
not
be
thousands
instead
of
hundreds
and
they
became
an
easy
prey
to
their
enemies
surrounded
mixed
with
their
assailants
they
knew
not
friends
from
foes
and
each
individual
being
bent
on
flight
they
indiscriminately
cut
to
right
and
left
wounding
as
many
of
their
own
men
as
of
the
scots
and
finally
after
slaughtering
half
their
companions
some
few
escaped
through
the
small
posterns
of
the
garrison
leaving
the
inner
ballia
entirely
in
possession
of
the
foe
the
whole
of
the
field
being
cleared
wallace
ordered
the
tower
to
be
forced
a
strong
guard
was
still
within
and
as
the
assailants
drew
near
every
means
was
used
to
render
their
assaults
abortive
as
the
scots
pressed
to
the
main
entrance
stones
and
heavy
metals
were
thrown
upon
their
heads
but
not
in
the
least
intimidated
they
stood
beneath
the
iron
shower
till
wallace
ordered
them
to
drive
a
large
felled
tree
which
lay
on
the
ground
against
the
hinges
of
the
door
it
burst
open
and
the
whole
party
rushed
into
the
hall
a
short
sanguinary
but
decisive
conflict
took
place
the
hauberk
and
plaid
of
wallace
were
dyed
from
head
to
foot
his
own
brave
blood
and
the
ferocious
stream
from
his
enemies
mingled
in
one
horrid
hue
upon
his
garments
wallace
wallace
cried
the
stentorian
lungs
of
kirkpatrick
in
a
moment
wallace
was
at
his
side
and
found
him
wrestling
with
two
men
the
light
of
a
single
lamp
suspended
from
the
rafters
fell
direct
upon
the
combatants
a
dagger
was
pointed
at
the
life
of
the
old
knight
but
wallace
laid
the
holder
of
it
dead
across
the
body
of
his
intended
victim
and
catching
the
other
assailant
by
the
throat
threw
him
prostrate
to
the
ground
spare
me
for
the
honor
of
knighthood
cried
the
conquered
for
my
honor
you
shall
die
cried
kirkpatrick
his
sword
was
already
at
the
heart
of
the
englishman
wallace
beat
it
back
kirkpatrick
he
is
my
prisoner
and
i
give
him
life
you
know
not
what
you
do
cried
the
old
knight
struggling
with
wallace
to
release
his
this
is
de
valence
quarter
reiterated
the
panting
and
earl
noble
wallace
my
life
for
i
am
wounded
sooner
take
my
own
cried
the
determined
kirkpatrick
fixing
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
the
prostrate
man
and
trying
to
wrench
his
hand
from
the
grasp
of
his
commander
shame
cried
wallace
you
must
strike
through
me
to
kill
any
wounded
man
i
hear
cry
for
quarter
release
the
earl
for
your
own
honor
our
safety
lies
in
his
destruction
cried
kirkpatrick
and
enraged
at
opposition
he
thrust
his
commander
little
expecting
such
an
action
from
off
the
body
of
the
earl
de
valence
seized
his
advantage
and
catching
kirkpatrick
by
the
limb
that
pressed
on
him
overthrew
him
and
by
a
sudden
spring
turning
quickly
on
wallace
struck
his
dagger
into
his
side
all
this
was
done
in
an
instant
wallace
did
not
fall
but
staggering
with
the
weapon
sticking
in
the
wound
he
was
so
surprised
by
the
baseness
of
the
deed
he
could
not
give
the
alarm
till
its
perpetrator
had
disappeared
the
flying
earl
took
his
course
through
a
narrow
passage
between
the
works
and
proceeding
swiftly
toward
the
south
issued
safely
at
one
of
the
outer
ballium
gates
that
part
of
the
castle
being
now
solitary
all
the
men
having
been
drawn
from
the
walls
to
the
contest
within
and
thence
he
made
his
escape
in
a
fisher
boat
across
the
clyde
meanwhile
wallace
having
recovered
himself
just
as
the
scots
brought
in
lighted
torches
from
the
lower
apartments
of
the
tower
saw
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
leaning
sternly
on
his
sword
and
the
young
edwin
coming
forward
in
garments
too
nearly
the
hue
of
his
own
andrew
murray
stood
already
by
his
side
wallace
hand
was
upon
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
which
the
ungrateful
de
valence
had
left
in
his
breast
you
are
wounded
you
are
slain
cried
murray
in
a
voice
of
consternation
edwin
stood
motionless
with
horror
that
dagger
exclaimed
scrymgeour
has
done
nothing
replied
wallace
but
let
a
little
more
blood
as
he
spoke
he
drew
it
out
and
thrusting
the
corner
of
his
scarf
into
his
bosom
staunched
the
wound
so
is
your
mercy
rewarded
exclaimed
kirkpatrick
so
am
i
true
to
a
soldier
duty
returned
wallace
though
de
valence
is
a
traitor
to
his
you
treated
him
as
a
man
replied
kirkpatrick
but
now
you
find
him
a
treacherous
fiend
your
eagerness
my
brave
friend
returned
wallace
has
lost
him
as
a
prisoner
if
not
for
humanity
or
honor
for
policy
sake
we
ought
to
have
spared
his
life
and
detained
him
as
an
hostage
for
our
countrymen
in
england
kirkpatrick
remembered
how
his
violence
had
released
the
earl
and
he
looked
down
abashed
wallace
perceiving
it
continued
but
let
us
not
abuse
our
time
discoursing
on
a
coward
he
is
gone
the
fortress
is
ours
and
our
first
measure
must
be
to
guard
if
from
surprise
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
fell
upon
edwin
who
having
recovered
from
the
shock
of
murray
exclamation
had
brought
forward
the
surgeon
of
their
little
band
a
few
minutes
bound
up
the
wounds
of
their
chief
even
while
beckoning
the
anxious
boy
towards
him
brave
youth
cried
he
you
at
the
imminent
risk
of
your
own
life
explored
these
heights
that
you
might
render
our
ascent
more
sure
you
who
have
fought
like
a
young
lion
in
this
unequal
contest
here
in
the
face
of
all
your
valiant
comrades
receive
that
knighthood
which
rather
derives
luster
from
your
virtues
than
gives
additional
consequence
to
your
name
with
a
bounding
heart
edwin
bent
his
knee
and
wallace
giving
him
the
hallowed
accolade
the
young
knight
rose
from
his
position
with
all
the
roses
of
his
springing
fame
glowing
in
his
countenance
scrymgeour
presented
him
the
knightly
girdle
which
he
unbraced
from
his
own
loins
and
while
the
happy
boy
received
the
sword
to
which
it
was
attached
he
exclaimed
with
animation
while
i
follow
the
example
before
my
eyes
i
shall
never
draw
this
in
an
unjust
cause
nor
ever
sheath
it
in
a
just
one
the
three
strokes
of
the
sword
given
in
knighting
go
then
returned
wallace
smiling
his
approval
of
this
sentiment
while
work
is
to
be
done
i
will
keep
my
knight
to
the
toil
go
and
with
twenty
men
of
lanark
guard
the
wall
by
which
we
ascended
edwin
disappeared
and
wallace
having
dispatched
detachments
to
occupy
other
parts
of
the
garrison
took
a
torch
in
his
hand
and
turning
to
murray
proposed
seeking
the
earl
of
mar
lord
andrew
was
soon
at
the
iron
door
which
led
from
the
hall
to
the
principal
stairs
we
must
have
our
friendly
here
cried
he
a
close
prisoner
do
they
indeed
keep
my
uncle
when
even
the
inner
doors
are
bolted
on
him
the
men
dragged
the
tree
forward
and
striking
it
against
the
iron
it
burst
open
with
the
noise
of
thunder
shrieks
from
within
followed
the
sound
the
women
of
lady
mar
not
knowing
what
to
suppose
during
the
uproar
of
the
conflict
now
hearing
the
door
forced
expected
nothing
less
than
that
some
new
enemies
were
advancing
and
giving
themselves
up
to
despair
they
flew
into
the
room
where
the
countess
sat
in
equal
though
less
clamorous
terror
at
the
shouts
of
the
scots
when
they
began
the
attack
the
earl
had
started
from
his
couch
that
is
not
peace
said
he
there
is
some
surprise
alas
from
whom
returned
lady
mar
who
would
venture
to
attack
a
fortress
like
this
garrisoned
with
thousands
the
cry
was
repeated
it
is
the
slogan
of
sir
william
wallace
cried
he
i
shall
be
free
o
for
a
sword
hear
hear
as
the
shouts
redoubled
and
mingled
with
the
various
clangors
of
battle
drew
nearer
the
tower
the
impatience
of
the
earl
could
not
be
restrained
hope
and
eagerness
seemed
to
have
dried
up
his
wounds
and
every
nerve
while
unarmed
as
he
was
he
rushed
from
the
apartment
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
iron
door
he
found
it
so
firmly
fastened
by
bars
and
padlocks
he
could
not
move
it
again
he
ascended
to
his
terrified
wife
who
conscious
how
little
obligation
wallace
owed
to
her
perhaps
dreaded
even
more
to
see
her
husband
hopes
realized
than
to
find
herself
yet
more
rigidly
the
prisoner
of
the
haughty
de
valence
joanna
cried
he
the
arm
of
god
is
with
us
my
prayers
are
heard
scotland
will
yet
be
free
hear
those
groans
those
shouts
victory
victory
as
he
thus
echoed
the
cry
of
triumph
uttered
by
the
scots
when
bursting
open
the
outer
gate
of
the
tower
the
foundations
of
the
building
shook
and
lady
mar
almost
insensible
with
terror
received
the
exhausted
body
of
her
husband
into
her
arms
he
fainted
from
the
transport
his
weakened
frame
was
unable
to
hear
soon
after
this
the
was
forced
and
the
women
ran
shrieking
into
the
room
to
their
mistress
the
countess
could
not
speak
but
sat
pale
and
motionless
supporting
his
head
on
her
bosom
guided
by
the
noise
lord
andrew
flew
into
the
room
and
rushing
toward
his
uncle
fell
at
his
feet
liberty
liberty
was
all
he
could
say
his
words
pierced
the
ear
of
the
earl
like
a
voice
from
heaven
and
looking
up
without
a
word
he
threw
his
arms
round
the
neck
of
his
nephew
tears
relieved
the
contending
feelings
of
the
countess
and
the
women
recognizing
the
young
lord
of
bothwell
retired
into
a
distant
corner
well
assured
they
had
now
no
cause
for
fear
the
earl
rested
but
a
moment
on
the
panting
breast
of
his
nephew
when
gazing
round
to
seek
the
mighty
leader
of
the
band
he
saw
wallace
enter
with
the
step
of
security
and
triumph
in
his
eyes
ever
my
deliverer
cried
the
venerable
mar
stretching
forth
his
arms
the
next
instant
he
held
wallace
to
his
breast
and
remembering
all
that
he
had
lost
for
his
sake
since
they
parted
a
soldier
heart
melted
and
he
burst
into
tears
wallace
my
preserver
thou
victim
for
scotland
and
for
me
or
rather
thou
chosen
of
heaven
who
by
the
sacrifice
of
all
thou
didst
hold
dear
on
earth
art
made
a
blessing
to
thy
country
my
thanks
and
my
heart
wallace
felt
all
in
his
soul
which
the
earl
meant
to
imply
but
recovered
the
calmed
tone
of
his
mind
before
he
was
released
from
the
embrace
of
his
friend
and
when
he
raised
him
self
and
replied
to
the
acknowledgments
of
the
countess
it
was
with
a
serene
though
glowing
countenance
she
when
she
had
glanced
from
the
eager
entrance
and
action
of
her
nephew
to
the
advancing
hero
looked
as
venus
did
when
she
beheld
the
god
of
war
rise
from
a
field
of
blood
she
started
at
the
appearance
of
wallace
but
it
was
not
his
garments
dropping
gore
nor
the
falchion
in
his
hand
that
caused
the
new
sensation
it
was
the
figure
breathing
youth
and
manhood
it
was
the
face
where
every
noble
passion
of
the
heart
had
stamped
themselves
on
his
perfect
features
it
was
his
air
where
majesty
and
sweet
entrancing
grace
mingled
in
manly
union
they
were
all
these
that
struck
at
once
upon
the
sight
of
lady
mar
and
made
her
exclaim
within
herself
this
is
a
wonder
of
man
this
is
the
hero
that
is
to
humble
edward
bless
whom
was
her
thought
oh
no
woman
let
him
be
a
creature
enshrined
and
holy
for
no
female
heart
to
dare
to
love
this
passed
through
the
mind
of
the
countess
in
less
time
than
it
has
been
repeated
and
when
she
saw
him
clasped
in
her
husband
arms
she
exclaimed
to
herself
helen
thou
wert
right
thy
gratitude
was
prophetic
of
a
matchless
object
while
i
wretch
that
i
was
even
whispered
the
wish
to
my
traitorous
heart
while
i
gave
information
against
my
husband
that
this
man
the
cause
of
all
might
be
secured
or
slain
just
as
the
last
idea
struck
her
wallace
rose
from
the
embrace
of
his
venerable
friend
and
met
the
riveted
eye
of
the
countess
she
stammered
forth
a
few
expressions
of
obligation
he
attributed
her
confusion
to
the
surprise
of
the
moment
and
replying
to
her
respectfully
turned
again
to
the
earl
the
joy
of
the
venerable
chief
was
unbounded
when
he
found
that
a
handful
of
scots
had
put
two
thousand
southrons
to
flight
and
gained
entire
possession
of
the
castle
wallace
having
satisfied
the
anxious
questions
of
his
noble
auditor
gladly
perceived
the
morning
light
he
rose
from
his
seat
i
shall
take
a
temporary
leave
of
you
my
lord
said
he
to
the
earl
i
must
now
visit
my
brave
comrades
at
their
posts
and
see
the
colors
of
scotland
planted
on
the
citadel
chapter
xxiv
the
great
tower
when
wallace
withdrew
lady
mar
who
had
detained
murray
whispered
to
him
while
a
blush
stained
her
cheek
that
she
should
like
to
be
present
at
the
planting
of
the
standard
lord
mar
declared
his
willingness
to
accompany
her
to
the
spot
and
added
i
can
be
supported
thither
by
the
arm
of
andrew
murray
hesitated
it
will
be
impossible
for
my
aunt
to
go
the
hall
below
and
the
ground
before
the
tower
are
covered
with
slain
let
them
be
cleared
away
cried
she
for
i
can
not
consent
to
be
deprived
of
a
spectacle
so
honorable
to
my
country
murray
regarded
the
pitiless
indifference
with
which
she
gave
this
order
with
amazement
to
do
that
madam
said
he
is
beyond
my
power
the
whole
ceremony
of
the
colors
would
be
completed
long
before
i
could
clear
the
earth
of
half
its
bleeding
load
i
will
seek
a
passage
for
you
by
some
other
way
before
the
earl
could
make
a
remark
murray
had
disappeared
and
after
exploring
the
lower
part
of
the
tower
in
unavailing
search
for
a
way
he
met
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
issuing
from
a
small
door
which
being
in
shadow
he
had
hitherto
overlooked
it
led
through
the
ballium
to
the
platform
before
the
citadel
lord
andrew
returned
to
his
uncle
and
aunt
and
informing
them
of
this
discovery
gave
his
arm
to
lord
mar
while
kirkpatrick
led
forward
the
agitated
countess
at
this
moment
the
sun
rose
behind
the
purple
summit
of
ben
lomond
when
they
approached
the
citadel
wallace
and
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
had
just
gained
its
summit
the
standard
of
edward
was
yet
flying
wallace
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
then
laying
his
hand
on
the
staff
down
thou
red
dragon
cried
he
and
learn
to
bow
before
the
giver
of
all
victory
even
while
speaking
he
rent
it
from
the
roof
and
casting
it
over
the
battlements
planted
the
lion
of
scotland
in
its
stead
as
its
vast
evolvements
floated
on
the
air
the
cry
of
triumph
the
loud
clarion
of
honest
triumph
burst
from
every
heart
horn
and
trumpet
below
it
was
a
shout
that
pierced
the
skies
and
entered
the
soul
of
wallace
with
a
bliss
which
seemed
a
promise
of
immortality
o
god
cried
he
still
grasping
the
staff
and
looking
up
to
heaven
we
got
not
this
in
possession
through
our
own
might
but
thy
right
hand
and
the
light
of
thy
countenance
overthrew
the
enemy
thine
the
conquest
thine
the
glory
thus
we
consecrate
the
day
to
thee
power
of
heaven
rejoined
scrymgeour
and
let
this
standard
be
thine
own
and
whithersoever
we
bear
it
may
we
ever
find
it
as
the
ark
of
our
god
wallace
feeling
as
if
no
eye
looked
on
them
but
that
of
heaven
dropped
on
his
knee
and
rising
again
took
sir
alexander
by
the
hand
my
brave
friend
said
he
we
have
here
planted
the
tree
of
freedom
in
scotland
should
i
die
in
its
defense
swear
to
bury
me
under
its
branches
swear
that
no
enslaved
grounds
shall
cover
my
remains
i
swear
cried
scrymgeour
laying
his
crossed
hands
upon
the
arm
of
wallace
i
swear
with
a
double
vow
by
the
blood
of
my
brave
ancestors
whose
valor
gave
me
the
name
i
bear
by
the
cross
of
andrew
and
by
your
valiant
self
never
to
sheath
my
sword
while
i
have
life
in
my
body
until
scotland
be
entirely
free
the
colors
fixed
wallace
and
his
brave
colleague
descended
the
tower
and
perceiving
the
earl
and
countess
who
sat
on
a
stone
bench
at
the
end
of
the
platform
approached
them
the
countess
rose
as
the
chiefs
drew
near
lord
mar
took
his
friend
by
the
hand
with
a
gratulation
in
his
eyes
that
was
unutterable
his
lady
spoke
hardly
conscious
of
what
she
said
and
wallace
after
a
few
minutes
discourse
proposed
to
the
earl
to
retire
with
lady
mar
into
the
citadel
where
she
would
be
more
suitably
lodged
than
in
their
late
prison
lord
mar
was
obeying
this
movement
when
suddenly
stopping
he
exclaimed
but
where
is
that
wondrous
boy
your
pilot
over
these
perilous
rocks
let
me
give
him
a
soldier
thanks
happy
at
so
grateful
a
demand
wallace
beckoned
edwin
who
just
relieved
from
his
guard
was
standing
at
some
distance
here
said
he
is
my
knight
of
fifteen
for
last
night
he
proved
himself
more
worthy
of
his
spurs
than
many
a
man
who
has
received
them
from
a
king
he
shall
wear
those
of
a
king
rejoined
the
lord
mar
unbuckling
from
his
feet
a
pair
of
golden
spurs
these
were
fastened
on
my
heels
by
our
great
king
alexander
at
the
battle
of
largs
i
had
intended
them
for
my
only
son
but
the
first
knight
in
the
cause
of
rescued
scotland
is
the
son
of
my
heart
and
soul
as
he
spoke
he
would
have
pressed
the
young
hero
to
his
breast
but
edwin
trembling
with
emotion
slid
down
upon
his
knees
and
clasping
the
earl
hand
said
in
a
hardly
audible
voice
receive
and
pardon
the
truant
son
of
your
sister
ruthven
what
exclaimed
the
veteran
is
it
edwin
ruthven
that
has
brought
me
this
weight
of
honor
come
to
my
arms
thou
dearest
child
of
my
dearest
janet
the
uncle
and
nephew
were
folded
in
each
other
embrace
lady
mar
wept
and
wallace
unable
to
bear
the
remembrance
which
such
a
scene
pressed
upon
his
heart
turned
away
toward
the
battlements
edwin
murmured
a
short
explanation
in
the
ear
of
his
uncle
and
then
rising
from
his
arms
with
his
beautiful
face
glittering
like
an
april
day
in
tears
allowed
his
gay
cousin
murray
to
buckle
the
royal
spurs
on
his
feet
the
rite
over
he
kissed
lord
andrew
hand
in
token
of
acknowledgment
and
called
on
sir
william
wallace
to
bless
the
new
honors
conferred
on
his
knight
wallace
turned
toward
edwin
with
a
smile
which
partook
more
of
heaven
than
of
earth
have
we
not
performed
our
mutual
promises
said
he
i
brought
you
to
the
spot
where
you
were
to
reveal
your
name
and
you
have
declared
it
to
me
by
the
voice
of
glory
come
then
my
brother
let
us
leave
your
uncle
awhile
to
seek
his
repose
as
he
spoke
he
bowed
to
the
countess
and
edwin
joyfully
receiving
his
arm
they
walked
together
toward
the
eastern
postern
agitated
with
the
delightful
surprise
of
thus
meeting
his
favorite
sister
son
whom
he
had
never
seen
since
his
infancy
and
exhausted
by
the
variety
of
his
late
emotions
the
earl
speedily
acquiesced
in
a
proposal
for
rest
and
leaning
on
lord
andrew
proceeded
to
the
citadel
the
countess
had
other
attractions
lingering
at
the
side
of
the
rough
knight
of
torthorald
she
looked
back
and
when
she
saw
the
object
of
her
gaze
disappear
through
the
gates
she
sighed
and
turning
to
her
conductor
walked
by
him
in
silence
till
they
joined
her
husband
in
the
hall
of
the
keep
murray
led
the
way
into
the
apartments
lately
occupied
by
de
valence
they
were
furnished
with
all
the
luxury
of
a
southron
nobleman
lady
mar
cast
her
eyes
around
the
splendid
chamber
and
seated
herself
on
one
of
its
tapestried
couches
the
earl
not
marking
whether
it
were
silk
or
rushes
placed
himself
beside
her
murray
drew
a
stool
toward
them
while
kirkpatrick
tired
of
his
gallant
duty
abruptly
took
his
leave
my
dear
andrew
said
the
earl
in
the
midst
of
this
proud
rejoicing
there
is
yet
a
canker
at
my
heart
tell
me
that
when
my
beloved
helen
disappeared
in
the
tumult
at
bothwell
she
was
under
your
protection
she
was
replied
murray
and
i
thank
the
holy
fillan
she
is
now
in
the
sanctuary
of
his
church
murray
then
recounted
to
his
relieved
uncle
every
event
from
the
moment
of
his
withdrawing
behind
the
arras
to
that
of
his
confiding
the
english
soldier
with
the
iron
box
to
the
care
of
the
prior
lord
mar
sighed
heavily
when
he
spoke
of
that
mysterious
casket
whatever
it
contained
said
he
it
has
drawn
after
it
much
evil
and
much
good
the
domestic
peace
of
wallace
was
ruined
by
it
and
the
spirit
which
now
restores
scotland
to
herself
was
raised
by
his
wrongs
but
tell
me
added
he
do
you
think
my
daughter
safe
so
near
a
garrison
of
the
enemy
surely
my
lord
cried
the
countess
too
well
remembering
the
enthusiasm
with
which
helen
had
regarded
even
the
unknown
wallace
surely
you
would
not
bring
that
tender
child
into
a
scene
like
this
rather
send
a
messenger
to
convey
her
secretly
to
thirlestan
at
that
distance
she
will
be
safe
and
under
the
powerful
protection
of
her
grandfather
the
earl
acquiesced
in
her
opinion
and
saying
he
would
consult
with
wallace
about
the
securest
mode
of
travel
for
his
daughter
again
turned
to
lord
andrew
to
learn
further
of
their
late
proceedings
but
the
countess
still
uneasy
once
more
interrupted
him
alas
my
lord
what
would
you
do
his
generous
zeal
will
offer
to
go
in
person
for
your
daughter
we
know
not
what
dangers
he
might
then
incur
and
surely
the
champion
of
scotland
is
not
to
be
thrown
into
peril
for
any
domestic
concern
if
you
really
feel
the
weight
of
the
evils
into
which
you
have
plunged
sir
william
wallace
do
not
increase
it
by
even
hinting
to
him
the
present
subject
of
your
anxiety
my
aunt
is
an
oracle
resumed
murray
allow
me
to
be
the
happy
knight
that
is
to
bear
the
surrender
of
dumbarton
to
my
sweet
cousin
prevail
on
wallace
to
remain
in
this
garrison
till
i
return
and
then
full
tilt
for
the
walls
of
old
sterling
and
the
downfall
of
hughie
cressingham
both
the
countess
and
the
earl
were
pleased
with
this
arrangement
the
latter
by
the
persuasions
of
his
nephew
retired
into
an
inner
chamber
to
repose
and
the
former
desired
lord
andrew
to
inform
wallace
that
she
should
expect
to
be
honored
with
his
presence
at
noon
to
partake
of
such
fare
as
the
garrison
afforded
on
murray
coming
from
the
citadel
he
learned
that
wallace
was
gone
toward
the
great
tower
he
followed
him
thither
and
on
issuing
from
the
postern
which
led
to
that
part
of
the
rock
saw
the
chief
standing
with
his
helmet
off
in
the
midst
of
the
slain
this
is
a
sorry
sight
said
he
to
murray
as
he
approached
but
it
shall
not
long
lie
thus
exposed
i
have
just
ordered
that
these
sad
wrecks
of
human
strife
may
be
lowered
into
the
clyde
its
rushing
stream
will
soon
carry
them
to
a
quiet
grave
beneath
yon
peaceful
sea
his
own
dead
amounting
to
no
more
than
fifteen
were
to
be
buried
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
a
prisoner
in
the
castle
having
described
steps
in
the
cliff
by
which
the
solemnity
could
easily
be
performed
but
why
my
dear
commander
cried
lord
andrew
why
do
you
take
any
thought
about
our
enemies
leave
them
where
they
are
and
the
eagles
of
our
mountains
will
soon
find
them
graves
for
shame
murray
was
the
reply
of
wallace
they
are
dead
and
our
enemies
no
more
they
are
men
like
ourselves
and
shall
we
deny
them
a
place
in
that
earth
whence
we
all
sprung
we
war
not
with
human
nature
are
we
not
rather
the
asserters
of
her
rights
i
know
replied
lord
andrew
blushing
that
i
am
often
the
asserter
of
my
own
folly
and
i
do
not
know
how
you
will
forgive
my
inconsiderate
impertinence
because
it
was
inconsiderate
replied
wallace
inhumanity
is
too
stern
a
guest
to
live
in
such
a
breast
as
yours
if
i
ever
give
her
quarters
replied
murray
i
should
most
wofully
disgrace
the
companion
she
must
meet
there
next
to
the
honor
of
fair
scotland
my
cousin
helen
is
the
goddess
of
my
idolatry
and
she
would
forswear
my
love
and
kindred
could
she
believe
me
capable
of
feeling
otherwise
than
in
unison
with
sir
william
wallace
wallace
looked
toward
him
with
a
benign
pleasure
in
his
countenance
your
fair
cousin
does
me
honor
ah
my
noble
friend
cried
murray
lowering
his
gay
tone
to
one
of
softer
expression
if
you
knew
all
the
goodness
all
the
nobleness
that
dwells
in
her
gentle
heart
you
would
indeed
esteem
her
you
would
love
her
as
i
do
the
blood
fled
from
the
cheek
of
wallace
not
as
you
do
murray
i
can
no
more
love
a
woman
as
you
love
her
such
scenes
as
these
cried
he
turning
to
the
mangled
bodies
which
the
men
were
now
carrying
away
to
the
precipice
of
the
clyde
have
divorced
woman
love
from
my
heart
i
am
all
my
country
or
i
am
nothing
nothing
reiterated
murray
laying
his
hand
upon
that
of
wallace
as
it
rested
upon
the
hilt
of
the
sword
on
which
he
leaned
is
the
friend
of
mankind
the
champion
of
scotland
the
beloved
of
a
thousand
valuable
hearts
nothing
nay
art
thou
not
the
agent
of
heaven
to
be
the
scourge
of
a
tyrant
art
thou
not
the
deliverer
of
thy
country
wallace
turned
his
bright
eye
upon
murray
with
an
expression
of
mingled
feelings
may
i
be
all
this
my
friend
and
wallace
must
yet
be
happy
but
speak
not
to
me
of
love
and
woman
tell
me
not
of
those
endearing
qualities
i
have
prized
too
tenderly
and
which
are
now
buried
to
me
forever
beneath
the
ashes
of
ellerslie
not
under
the
ashes
of
ellerslie
cried
murray
sleep
the
remains
of
your
lovely
wife
wallace
penetrating
eye
turned
quick
upon
him
murray
continued
my
cousin
pitying
soul
stretched
itself
toward
them
by
her
directions
they
were
brought
from
your
oratory
in
the
rock
and
deposited
with
all
holy
rites
in
the
cemetery
at
bothwell
the
glow
that
now
animated
the
before
chilled
heart
of
wallace
overspread
his
face
his
eyes
spoke
volumes
of
gratitude
his
lips
moved
but
his
feelings
were
too
big
for
utterance
and
fervently
pressing
the
hand
of
murray
to
conceal
emotions
ready
to
shake
his
manhood
he
turned
away
and
walked
toward
the
cliff
when
all
the
slain
were
lowered
to
their
last
beds
a
young
priest
who
came
in
the
company
of
scrymgeour
gave
the
funeral
benediction
both
to
the
departed
in
the
waves
and
those
whom
the
shore
had
received
the
rites
over
murray
again
drew
near
to
wallace
and
delivered
his
message
i
shall
obey
her
commands
returned
he
but
first
we
must
visit
our
wounded
prisoners
in
the
tower
above
three
hundred
of
them
had
been
discovered
amongst
the
dead
murray
gladly
obeyed
the
impulse
of
his
leader
arm
and
followed
by
the
chieftains
returned
from
the
late
solemn
duty
they
entered
the
tower
ireland
welcomed
wallace
with
the
intelligence
that
he
hoped
he
had
succored
friends
instead
of
foes
for
that
most
of
the
prisoners
were
poor
welsh
peasants
whom
edward
had
torn
from
their
mountains
to
serve
in
his
legions
and
a
few
irish
who
in
the
heat
of
blood
and
eagerness
for
adventure
had
enlisted
in
his
ranks
i
have
shown
to
them
continued
ireland
what
fools
they
are
to
injure
themselves
in
us
i
told
the
welsh
they
were
clinching
their
own
chains
by
assisting
to
extend
the
dominion
of
their
conqueror
and
i
have
convinced
the
irish
they
were
forging
fetters
for
themselves
by
lending
their
help
to
enslave
their
brother
nation
the
scots
they
only
require
your
presence
my
lord
to
forswear
their
former
leaders
and
to
enlist
under
scottish
banners
thou
art
an
able
orator
my
good
stephen
returned
wallace
and
whatever
promises
thou
hast
made
to
honest
men
in
the
name
of
scotland
we
are
ready
to
ratify
them
is
it
not
so
added
he
turning
to
kirkpatrick
and
scrymgeour
all
as
you
will
replied
they
in
one
voice
yes
added
kirkpatrick
you
were
the
first
to
rise
for
scotland
and
who
but
you
has
a
right
to
command
for
her
ireland
threw
open
the
door
which
led
into
the
hall
and
there
on
the
ground
on
pallets
of
straw
lay
most
of
the
wounded
southrons
some
of
their
dimmed
eyes
had
discerned
their
preserver
when
he
discovered
them
expiring
on
the
rock
and
on
sight
of
him
now
they
uttered
such
a
piercing
cry
of
gratitude
that
surprised
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
that
moment
five
or
six
of
the
poor
wounded
wretches
crawled
to
his
feet
our
friend
our
preserver
burst
from
their
lips
as
they
kissed
the
edge
of
his
plaid
not
to
me
not
to
me
exclaimed
wallace
i
am
a
soldier
like
yourselves
i
have
only
acted
a
soldier
part
but
i
am
a
soldier
of
freedom
you
of
a
tyrant
who
seeks
to
enslave
the
world
this
makes
the
difference
between
us
this
lays
you
at
my
feet
when
i
would
more
willingly
receive
you
into
my
arms
as
brothers
in
one
generous
cause
we
are
yours
was
the
answering
exclamation
of
those
who
knelt
and
of
those
who
raised
their
feebler
voices
from
their
beds
of
straw
a
few
only
remained
silent
with
many
kind
expressions
of
acceptance
wallace
disengaged
himself
from
those
who
clung
around
him
and
then
moved
toward
the
sick
who
seemed
too
ill
to
speak
while
repeating
the
same
consolatory
language
to
them
he
particularly
observed
an
old
man
who
was
lying
between
two
young
ones
and
still
kept
a
profound
silence
his
rough
features
were
marked
with
many
a
scar
but
there
was
a
meek
resignation
in
her
face
that
powerfully
struck
wallace
when
the
chief
drew
near
the
veteran
raised
himself
on
his
arm
and
bowed
his
head
with
a
respectful
air
wallace
stopped
you
are
an
englishman
i
am
sir
and
have
no
services
to
offer
you
these
two
young
men
on
each
side
of
me
are
my
sons
there
brother
i
lost
last
night
in
the
conflict
by
your
mercy
not
only
my
life
is
preserved
but
my
two
remaining
children
also
yet
i
am
an
englishman
and
i
can
not
be
grateful
at
the
expense
of
my
allegiance
nor
would
i
require
it
of
you
returned
wallace
these
brave
welsh
and
irish
were
brought
hither
by
the
invader
who
subjugates
their
countries
they
owe
him
no
duty
but
you
are
a
free
subject
of
england
he
that
is
a
tyrant
over
others
can
only
be
a
king
to
you
he
must
be
the
guardian
of
your
laws
the
defender
of
your
liberties
or
his
scepter
falls
having
sworn
to
follow
a
sovereign
so
plighted
i
am
not
severe
enough
to
condemn
you
because
misled
by
that
phantom
which
he
calls
glory
you
have
suffered
him
to
betray
you
into
unjust
conquests
once
i
have
been
so
misled
returned
the
old
man
but
i
never
will
again
fifty
years
i
have
fought
under
the
british
standard
in
normandy
and
in
palestine
and
now
in
my
old
age
with
four
sons
i
followed
the
armies
of
my
sovereign
into
scotland
my
eldest
i
lost
on
the
plains
of
dunbar
my
second
fell
last
night
and
my
two
youngest
are
now
by
my
side
you
have
saved
them
and
me
what
can
i
do
not
as
your
noble
self
says
forswear
my
country
but
this
i
swear
and
in
the
oath
do
you
my
sons
join
as
he
spoke
they
laid
their
crossed
hands
upon
his
in
token
of
assent
never
to
lift
an
arm
against
sir
william
wallace
or
the
cause
of
injured
scotland
to
this
we
also
subjoin
cried
several
other
men
who
comprised
the
whole
of
the
english
prisoners
noble
people
cried
wallace
why
have
you
not
a
king
worthy
of
you
and
yet
observed
kirkpatrick
in
a
surly
tone
heselrigge
was
one
of
these
people
wallace
turned
upon
him
with
a
look
of
so
tremendous
a
meaning
that
awed
by
an
expression
too
mighty
for
him
to
comprehend
he
fell
back
a
few
paces
muttering
curses
but
on
whom
could
not
be
heard
that
man
would
arouse
the
tiger
in
our
chief
whispered
scrymgeour
to
murray
ay
returned
lord
andrew
but
the
royal
spirit
keeps
the
beast
in
awe
see
how
coweringly
that
bold
spirit
now
bows
before
it
wallace
marked
the
impression
his
glance
had
made
but
where
he
had
struck
being
unqilling
to
pierce
also
he
dispelled
the
thunder
from
his
countenance
and
once
more
looking
on
sir
roger
with
a
frank
serenity
come
said
he
my
good
knight
you
must
not
be
more
tenacious
for
william
wallace
than
he
is
for
himself
while
he
possesses
such
a
zealous
friend
as
kirkpatrick
of
torthorald
he
need
not
now
fear
the
arms
of
a
thousand
heselrigges
no
nor
of
edwards
either
cried
kirkpatrick
once
more
looking
boldly
up
and
shaking
his
broad
claymore
my
thistle
has
a
point
to
sting
all
to
death
who
would
pass
between
this
arm
and
my
breast
may
heaven
long
preserve
the
valiant
wallace
was
the
prayer
of
every
feeble
voice
as
he
left
the
hall
to
visit
his
own
wounded
in
an
upper
chamber
the
interview
was
short
and
satisfactory
ah
sir
cried
one
of
them
i
can
not
tell
how
it
is
but
when
i
see
you
i
feel
as
if
i
beheld
the
very
soul
of
my
country
or
its
guardian
angel
standing
before
me
a
something
i
can
not
describe
but
it
fills
me
with
courage
and
comfort
you
see
an
honest
scot
standing
before
you
my
good
duncan
replied
wallace
and
that
is
no
mean
personage
for
it
is
one
who
knows
no
use
of
his
life
but
as
it
fulfills
his
duty
to
his
country
oh
that
the
sound
of
that
voice
could
penetrate
to
every
ear
in
scotland
rejoined
the
soldier
it
would
be
more
than
the
call
of
the
trumpet
to
bring
them
to
the
field
and
from
the
summit
of
this
rock
many
have
already
heard
it
and
more
shall
be
so
aroused
cried
murray
returning
from
the
door
to
which
one
of
his
men
had
beckoned
him
here
is
a
man
come
to
announce
that
malcolm
earl
of
lennox
passing
by
the
foot
of
this
rock
saw
the
scottish
standard
flying
from
its
citadel
and
as
overjoyed
as
amazed
at
the
sight
he
sends
to
request
the
confidence
of
being
admitted
let
me
bring
him
hither
interrupted
kirkpatrick
he
is
brave
as
the
day
and
will

a
noble

true
scot
must
be
welcome

these
walls
returned
wallace
kirkpatrick
hastened
from
the
tower
to
the
northern
side
of
the
rock
at
the
foot
of
which
stood
the
earl
and
his
train
with
all
the
pride
of
a
freeman
and
a
victor
sir
roger
descended
the
height
lennox
advanced
to
meet
him
what
is

roger
kirkpatrick
master
of
this
citadel
and
our

flying
from

where
the

are
the
dawn
to
a
blessed
day
for

no
replied
kirkpatrick
i
am
but
a
follower
of
the
man
who
has
struck
the
blow
sir
william
wallace
of
ellerslie
is
our
chief
and
with
the
power
of
his
virtues
he
subdues
not
only
friends
but
enemies
to
his
command
he
then
exultingly
narrated
the
happy
events
of
the
last
four
and
twenty
hours
the
earl
listened
with
wonder
and
joy
what
cried
he
so
noble
a
plan
for
scotland
and
i
ignorant
of
it
that
have
not
waked
day
or
night
for
many
a
month
without
thinking
or
dreaming
of
some
enterprise
to
free
my
country
and
behold
it
is
achieved
in
a
moment
i
see
the
stroke
as
a
bolt
from
heaven
and
i
pray
heaven
it
may
light
the
sacrifice
throughout
the
nation
lead
me
worthy
knight
lead
me
to
your
chief
for
he
shall
be
mine
too
he
shall
command
malcolm
lennox
and
all
his
clan
kirkpatrick
gladly
turned
to
obey
him
and
they
mounted
the
ascent
together
within
the
barbican
gate
stood
wallace
with
scrymgeour
and
murray
the
earl
knew
scrymgeour
well
having
often
seen
him
in
the
field
as
hereditary
of
the
kingdom
of
the
persons
of
the
others
he
was
ignorant
there
is
wallace
exclaimed
kirkpatrick
not
one
of
those
very
young
men
interrogated
the
earl
even
so
was
the
answer
of
the
knight
but
his
is
the
youth
of
the
brave
son
of
ammon
gray
beards
are
glad
to
bow
before
his
golden
locks
for
beneath
them
is
wisdom
as
he
spoke
they
entered
the
barbican
and
wallace
whom
the
penetrating
eye
of
lennox
had
already
singled
out
for
the
chief
advanced
to
meet
his
guest
earl
said
he
you
are
welcome
to
dumbarton
castle
bravest
of
my
countrymen
returned
lennox
clasping
him
in
his
arms
receive
a
soldier
embrace
receive
the
gratitude
of
a
loyal
heart
accept
my
service
my
arms
my
men
my
all
i
devote
to
scotland
and
the
great
cause
wallace
for
a
moment
did
not
answer
but
warmly
straining
the
earl
to
his
breast
said
as
he
released
him
such
support
will
give
sinews
to
our
power
a
few
months
and
with
the
blessing
of
that
arm
which
has
already
mowed
down
the
ranks
which
opposed
us
we
shall
see
scotland
at
liberty
and
may
heaven
brave
wallace
exclaimed
lennox
grant
us
thine
arm
to
wield
its
scythe
but
how
have
you
accomplished
this
how
have
your
few
overthrown
this
english
host
he
strikes
home
when
right
points
his
sword
replied
wallace
the
injuries
of
scotland
were
my
guide
and
justice
my
companion
we
feared
nothing
for
god
was
with
us
we
feared
nothing
and
in
his
might
we
conquered
and
shall
yet
conquer
cried
lennox
kindling
with
the
enthusiasm
that
blazed
from
the
eyes
of
wallace
i
feel
the
strength
of
our
cause
and
from
this
hour
i
devote
myself
to
assert
it
or
to
die
not
to
die
my
noble
lord
said
murray
we
have
yet
many
an
eve
to
dance
over
the
buried
fetters
of
scotland
and
as
a
beginning
of
our
jollities
i
must
remind
our
leader
that
my
aunt
board
awaits
him
lord
lennox
understood
from
this
address
it
was
the
brave
murray
who
spoke
to
him
for
he
had
heard
sufficient
from
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
to
explain
how
the
countess
of
mar
and
her
patriot
husband
came
within
those
walls
the
countess
having
arrayed
herself
with
all
her
powers
to
receive
her
deliverer
awaited
the
hour
of
his
arrival
with
an
emotion
at
her
heart
which
made
it
bound
against
her
bosom
when
she
saw
the
object
of
her
splendid
toil
advancing
along
the
courtyard
all
others
were
lost
to
her
impatient
eyes
and
hastily
rising
from
the
window
as
the
chiefs
entered
the
porch
she
crossed
the
room
to
meet
them
at
the
door
the
earl
of
lennox
stood
amazed
at
sight
of
so
much
beauty
and
splendor
in
such
a
scene
lady
mar
had
hardly
attained
her
year
but
from
the
graces
of
her
person
and
the
address
with
which
she
set
forth
all
her
charms
the
enchanted
gazer
found
it
impossible
to
suppose
her
more
than
three
or
four
and
twenty
thus
happily
formed
by
nature
and
habited
in
a
suit
of
velvet
overlaid
with
of
gold
blazing
with
jewels
about
her
head
and
her
feet
clad
in
sandals
lennox
thought
she
looked
more
like
some
triumphant
queen
than
a
wife
who
had
so
lately
shared
captivity
with
an
outlawed
husband
murray
started
at
such
unexpected
magnificence
in
his
aunt
but
wallace
scarcely
observed
it
was
anything
unusual
and
bowing
to
her
presented
the
earl
of
lennox
she
smiled
and
saying
a
few
words
of
welcome
to
the
earl
gave
her
hand
to
wallace
to
lead
her
back
into
the
chamber
is
the
style
for
state
dress
worn
by
noble
ladies
in
the
thirteenth
century
lord
mar
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
leaning
on
his
sword
for
his
warlike
arm
refused
any
other
staff
stood
up
on
their
entrance
at
sight
of
lord
lennox
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
glad
surprise
lennox
embraced
him
i
too
am
come
to
enlist
under
the
banners
of
this
young
leonidas
god
armeth
the
patriot
was
all
the
reply
that
mar
made
while
the
big
tears
rolled
over
his
cheek
and
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
i
have
four
hundred
stout
lennox
men
continued
the
earl
who
by
eve
shall
be
ready
to
follow
our
leader
to
the
very
borders
not
so
soon
interrupted
the
countess
our
deliverer
needs
repose
i
thank
your
benevolence
lady
mar
returned
wallace
but
the
issue
of
last
night
and
the
sight
of
lord
lennox
this
day
with
the
promise
of
so
great
a
support
are
such
aliments
that
we
must
go
forward
ay
to
be
sure
joined
kirkpatrick
dumbarton
was
not
taken
during
our
sleep
and
if
we
stay
loitering
here
the
devil
that
holds
stirling
castle
may
follow
the
scent
of
de
valence
and
so
i
lose
my
prey
what
cried
the
countess
and
is
my
lord
to
be
left
again
to
his
enemies
sir
william
wallace
i
should
have
everything
madam
rejoined
he
that
is
demonstrative
of
my
devotion
to
your
venerable
lord
but
with
a
brave
garrison
i
hope
you
will
consider
him
safe
here
until
a
wider
range
of
security
be
won
to
enable
you
to
retire
to
braemar
as
the
apostrophe
to
wallace
in
the
latter
part
of
the
speech
had
been
addressed
to
himself
in
rather
a
low
voice
his
reply
was
made
in
a
similar
tone
so
that
lord
mar
did
not
hear
any
part
of
the
answer
except
the
concluding
words
but
then
he
exclaimed
nay
my
joanna
art
thou
making
objections
to
keeping
garrison
here
i
confess
replied
wallace
that
an
armed
citadel
is
not
the
most
pleasant
abode
for
a
lady
but
at
present
excepting
perhaps
the
church
it
is
the
safest
and
i
would
not
advise
your
lady
to
remove
hence
until
the
plain
be
made
as
free
as
this
mountain
the
sewer
now
announced
the
board
in
the
hall
and
the
countess
leading
the
way
reluctantly
gave
her
hand
to
the
earl
of
lennox
lord
mar
leaned
on
the
arm
of
wallace
who
was
followed
by
edwin
and
the
other
chieftains
chapter
xxv
the
citadel
during
the
repast
the
countess
often
fixed
her
unrestrained
gaze
on
the
manly
yet
youthful
countenance
of
the
heroic
wallace
his
plumed
helmet
was
now
laid
aside
and
the
heavy
corselet
unbuckled
from
his
breast
disclosing
the
symmetry
of
his
fine
form
left
its
graceful
movements
to
be
displayed
with
advantage
by
the
flexible
folds
of
his
simple
tartan
vest
was
it
the
formidable
wallace
she
looked
on
bathed
in
the
blood
of
heselrigge
and
breathing
vengeance
against
the
adherents
of
the
tyrant
edward
it
was
then
the
enemy
of
her
kinsmen
of
the
house
of
cummin
it
was
the
man
for
whom
her
husband
had
embraced
so
many
dangers
it
was
the
man
whom
she
had
denounced
to
one
of
those
kinsmen
and
whom
she
had
betrayed
to
the
hazard
of
an
ignominious
death
but
where
now
was
the
fierce
rebel
the
ruiner
of
her
peace
the
outlaw
whom
she
had
wished
in
his
grave
the
last
idea
was
distraction
she
could
have
fallen
at
his
feet
and
bathing
them
with
her
tears
have
implored
his
pity
and
forgiveness
even
as
the
wish
sprung
in
her
mind
she
asked
did
he
know
all
could
he
pardon
such
a
weight
of
injuries
she
cast
her
eyes
with
a
wild
expression
upon
his
face
the
mildness
of
heaven
was
there
and
the
peace
too
she
might
have
thought
had
not
his
eye
carried
a
chastened
sadness
in
its
look
which
told
that
something
dire
and
sorrowful
was
buried
deep
within
it
was
a
look
that
dissolved
the
soul
which
gazed
on
it
the
countess
felt
her
heart
throb
violently
at
that
moment
wallace
addressed
a
few
words
to
her
but
she
knew
not
what
they
were
her
soul
was
in
tumults
and
a
mist
passed
over
her
sight
which
for
a
moment
seemed
to
wrap
all
her
senses
in
a
trance
the
unconscious
object
of
these
emotions
bowed
to
her
inarticulate
reply
supposing
that
the
mingling
voices
of
others
had
made
him
hear
hers
indistinctly
lady
mar
found
her
situation
so
strange
and
her
agitation
so
inexplicable
that
feeling
it
impossible
to
remain
longer
without
giving
way
to
a
burst
of
tears
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
forcing
a
smile
with
her
courtesy
to
the
company
left
the
room
on
gaining
the
upper
apartment
she
threw
herself
upon
the
nearest
couch
and
striking
her
breast
exclaimed
what
is
this
within
me
how
does
my
soul
seem
to
pour
itself
out
to
this
man
oh
how
does
it
extend
itself
as
if
it
would
absorb
his
even
at
my
eyes
only
twelve
hours
hardly
twelve
hours
have
i
seen
this
william
wallace
and
yet
my
very
being
is
now
lost
in
his
while
thus
speaking
she
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
but
no
tears
now
started
to
be
wiped
away
the
fire
in
her
veins
dried
the
source
and
with
burning
blushes
she
rose
from
her
seat
fatal
fatal
hour
why
didst
thou
come
here
too
infatuating
wallace
to
rob
me
of
my
peace
oh
why
did
i
ever
look
on
that
face
rather
blessed
saints
cried
she
clasping
her
hands
in
wild
passion
why
did
i
ever
shackle
this
hand
did
i
ever
render
such
a
sacrifice
necessary
wallace
is
now
free
had
i
been
free
but
wretch
wretch
wretch
i
could
tear
out
this
betrayed
heart
i
could
trample
on
that
of
the
infatuated
husband
that
made
me
such
a
slave
she
gasped
for
breath
and
again
seating
herself
reclined
her
beating
temples
against
the
couch
she
was
now
silent
but
thoughts
not
less
intense
not
less
fraught
with
and
anguish
occupied
her
mind
should
this
god
of
her
idolatry
ever
discover
that
it
was
her
information
which
had
sent
earl
de
valence
men
to
surround
him
in
the
mountains
should
he
ever
learn
that
at
bothwell
she
had
betrayed
the
cause
on
which
he
had
set
his
life
she
felt
that
moment
would
be
her
last
for
now
to
sate
her
eyes
with
gazing
on
him
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
voice
to
receive
his
smiles
seemed
to
her
a
joy
she
could
only
surrender
with
her
existence
what
then
was
the
prospect
of
so
soon
losing
him
even
to
crown
himself
with
honor
but
to
her
a
living
death
to
defer
his
departure
was
all
her
study
all
her
hope
and
fearful
that
his
restless
valor
might
urge
him
to
accompany
murray
in
his
intended
convoy
of
helen
to
the
tweed
she
determined
to
persuade
her
nephew
to
set
off
without
the
knowledge
of
his
general
she
did
not
allow
that
it
was
the
youthful
beauty
and
more
lovely
mind
of
her
which
she
feared
even
to
herself
she
cloaked
her
alarm
under
the
plausible
excuse
of
care
for
the
chieftain
safety
composed
by
this
mental
arrangement
her
disturbed
features
became
smooth
and
with
even
a
sedate
air
she
received
her
lord
and
his
brave
friends
when
they
soon
after
entered
the
chamber
but
the
object
of
her
wishes
did
not
appear
wallace
had
taken
lord
lennox
to
view
the
dispositions
of
the
fortress
ill
satisfied
as
she
was
with
his
prolonged
absence
she
did
not
fail
to
turn
it
to
advantage
and
while
her
lord
and
his
friends
were
examining
a
draft
of
scotland
which
wallace
had
sketched
after
she
left
the
she
took
lord
andrew
aside
to
converse
with
him
on
the
subject
now
nearest
to
her
heart
it
certainly
belongs
to
me
alone
her
kinsman
and
friend
to
protect
helen
to
the
tweed
if
there
she
must
go
returned
murray
but
my
good
lady
i
can
not
comprehend
why
i
am
to
lead
my
fair
cousin
such
a
pilgrimage
she
is
not
afraid
of
heroes
you
are
safe
in
dumbarton
and
why
not
bring
her
here
also
not
for
worlds
exclaimed
the
countess
thrown
off
her
guard
murray
looked
at
her
with
surprise
it
recalled
her
to
and
she
resumed
so
lovely
a
creature
in
this
castle
would
be
a
dangerous
magnet
you
must
have
known
that
it
was
the
hope
of
obtaining
her
which
attracted
the
lord
soulis
and
earl
de
valence
to
bothwell
the
whole
castle
rung
with
the
quarrel
of
these
two
lords
upon
her
account
when
you
so
fortunately
effected
her
escape
should
it
be
known
that
she
is
here
the
same
fierce
desire
of
obtaining
her
would
give
double
incitement
to
de
valence
to
recover
the
place
and
the
consequences
who
can
answer
for
by
this
argument
murray
was
persuaded
to
relinquish
the
idea
of
conveying
helen
to
dumbarton
but
remembering
what
wallace
had
said
respecting
the
safety
of
a
religious
sanctuary
he
advised
that
she
should
be
left
at
fillan
till
the
cause
of
scotland
might
be
more
firmly
established
send
a
messenger
to
inform
her
of
the
rescue
of
dumbarton
and
of
your
and
my
uncle
health
continued
he
and
that
will
be
sufficient
to
make
her
happy
that
she
was
not
to
be
thrown
in
wallace
way
satisfied
lady
mar
and
indifferent
whether
helen
seclusion
were
under
the
elidon
tree
or
the
holyrood
she
approved
murray
decision
relieved
from
apprehension
her
face
became
again
dressed
in
smiles
and
with
a
bounding
step
she
rose
to
welcome
the
of
wallace
with
the
earl
of
lennox
absorbed
in
one
thought
every
charm
she
possessed
was
directed
to
the
same
point
she
played
finely
on
the
lute
and
sung
with
all
the
grace
of
her
country
what
gentle
heart
was
not
to
be
affected
by
music
she
determined
it
should
be
once
of
the
spells
by
which
she
meant
to
attract
wallace
she
took
up
one
of
the
lutes
which
with
other
musical
instruments
decorated
the
apartments
of
the
luxurious
de
valence
and
touching
it
with
exquisite
delicacy
breathed
the
most
pathetic
air
her
memory
could
dictate
if
on
the
heath
she
moved
her
breast
was
whiter
than
the
down
of
cana
if
on
the
shore
than
the
foam
of
the
rolling
ocean
her
eyes
were
two
stars
of
light
her
face
was
heaven
bow
in
showers
her
dark
hair
flowed
around
it
like
the
streaming
clouds
thou
wert
the
dweller
of
souls
strinadona
wallace
rose
from
his
chair
which
had
been
placed
near
her
she
had
deigned
that
these
tender
words
of
the
bard
of
morven
should
suggest
to
her
hearer
the
observation
of
her
own
resembling
beauties
but
he
saw
in
them
only
the
lovely
dweller
of
his
own
soul
and
walking
toward
a
window
stood
there
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
descending
sun
so
hath
set
all
my
joys
so
is
life
to
me
a
world
without
a
cold
and
charmless
the
countess
vainly
believed
that
some
sensibility
advantageous
to
her
new
passion
had
caused
the
agitation
with
which
she
saw
him
depart
from
her
side
and
intoxicated
with
the
idea
she
ran
through
many
a
melodious
descant
till
toughing
on
the
first
strains
of
thusa
ha
measg
na
reultan
mor
she
saw
wallace
start
from
his
contemplative
position
and
with
a
pale
countenance
leave
the
room
there
was
something
in
this
abruptness
which
excited
the
alarm
of
the
earl
of
lennox
who
had
also
been
listening
to
the
songs
he
rose
instantly
and
overtaking
the
chief
at
the
threshold
inquired
what
was
the
matter
nothing
answered
wallace
forcing
a
smile
in
which
the
agony
of
his
mind
was
too
truly
imprinted
but
music
displeased
me
with
this
reply
he
disappeared
the
excuse
seemed
strange
but
it
was
true
for
she
whose
notes
were
to
him
sweeter
than
the
thrush
whose
angel
strains
used
to
greet
his
morning
and
evening
hours
was
silent
in
the
grave
he
should
no
more
see
her
white
hand
upon
the
lute
he
should
no
more
behold
that
bosom
brighter
than
foam
upon
the
wave
to
him
a
soulless
sound
or
a
direful
knell
to
recall
the
remembrance
of
all
he
had
lost
such
were
his
thoughts
when
the
words
of
thusa
ha
measg
rung
from
lady
mar
voice
those
were
the
strains
which
halbert
used
to
breathe
from
his
heart
to
call
marion
to
her
nightly
slumbers
those
were
the
strains
with
which
that
faithful
servant
had
announced
that
she
slept
to
wake
no
more
what
wonder
then
that
wallace
fled
from
the
apartment
and
buried
himself
and
his
aroused
grief
amid
the
distant
solitudes
of
the
while
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
his
uncle
on
the
station
which
stirling
held
amid
the
ochil
hills
edwin
had
at
intervals
cast
a
glance
upon
the
changing
complexion
of
his
commander
and
no
sooner
did
he
see
him
hurry
from
the
room
than
fearful
of
some
disaster
having
befallen
the
garrison
which
wallace
did
not
choose
immediately
to
mention
he
also
stole
out
of
the
apartment
after
seeking
the
object
of
his
anxiety
for
a
long
time
without
avail
he
was
returning
on
his
steps
when
attracted
by
the
splendor
of
the
moon
silvering
the
he
ascended
to
once
at
least
tread
that
acclivity
in
light
which
he
had
so
miraculously
passed
in
darkness
scarce
a
zephyr
fanned
the
sleeping
air
he
moved
on
with
a
flying
step
till
a
deep
sigh
arrested
him
he
stopped
and
listened
it
was
repeated
again
and
again
he
gently
drew
near
and
saw
a
human
figure
reclining
on
the
ground
the
head
of
the
apparent
mourner
was
unbonneted
and
the
brightness
of
the
moon
shone
on
his
polished
forehead
edwin
thought
the
sound
of
those
sighs
was
the
same
he
had
often
heard
from
the
object
of
his
search
he
walked
forward
again
the
figure
sighed
but
with
a
depth
so
full
of
piercing
woe
that
edwin
hesitated
a
cloud
had
passed
over
the
moon
but
sailing
off
again
displayed
to
the
anxious
boy
that
he
had
indeed
drawn
very
near
his
friend
who
goes
there
exclaimed
wallace
starting
on
his
feet
your
edwin
returned
the
youth
i
feared
something
wrong
had
happened
when
i
saw
you
look
so
sad
and
leave
the
room
abruptly
wallace
pressed
his
hand
in
silence
then
some
evil
has
befallen
you
inquired
edwin
in
an
agitated
voice
you
do
not
speak
wallace
seated
himself
on
a
stone
and
leaned
his
head
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
no
new
evil
has
befallen
me
edwin
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
remembrance
that
stabs
deeper
than
the
dagger
point
what
remembrance
can
wound
you
my
general
the
abbott
of
colomba
has
often
told
me
that
memory
is
a
balm
to
every
ill
with
the
good
and
have
not
you
been
good
to
all
the
benefactor
the
preserver
of
thousands
surely
if
man
can
be
happy
it
must
be
sir
william
wallace
and
so
i
am
my
edwin
when
i
contemplate
the
end
but
in
the
interval
with
all
thy
sweet
philosophy
is
it
not
written
here
man
was
made
to
mourn
he
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
then
after
a
short
pause
resumed
doubly
i
mourn
doubly
am
i
bereaved
for
had
it
not
been
for
an
enemy
more
fell
than
he
who
beguiled
adam
of
paradise
i
might
have
been
a
father
i
might
have
lived
to
have
gloried
in
a
son
like
thee
i
might
have
seen
my
wedded
angel
clasp
such
a
blessing
to
her
bosom
but
now
both
are
cold
in
clay
these
are
the
recollections
which
sometimes
draw
tears
down
thy
cheeks
and
do
not
believe
brother
of
my
soul
said
he
pressing
the
now
weeping
edwin
to
his
breast
that
they
disgrace
his
manhood
the
son
of
god
wept
over
the
tomb
of
his
friend
and
shall
i
deny
a
few
tears
dropped
in
stealth
over
the
grave
of
my
wife
and
child
edwin
sobbed
aloud
no
son
could
love
you
dearer
than
i
do
ah
let
my
duty
my
affection
teach
you
to
forget
you
have
lost
a
child
i
will
replace
all
to
you
but
your
marion
and
her
the
pitying
son
of
mary
will
restore
to
you
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
wallace
looked
steadfastly
at
the
young
preacher
of
the
mouths
of
babes
we
shall
hear
wisdom
thine
dear
edwin
i
will
lay
to
heart
thou
shalt
comfort
me
when
my
shuts
out
all
the
world
besides
then
i
am
indeed
your
brother
cried
the
happy
youth
admit
me
but
to
your
heart
and
no
fraternal
no
filial
tie
shall
be
more
strongly
linked
than
mine
what
tender
affections
i
can
spare
from
those
resplendent
regions
answered
wallace
pointing
to
the
skies
are
thine
the
fervors
of
my
once
ardent
soul
are
scotland
or
i
die
but
thou
art
too
young
my
brother
added
he
interrupting
himself
to
understand
all
his
feelings
all
the
seeming
contradictions
of
my
contending
heart
not
so
answered
edwin
with
a
modest
blush
what
was
lady
marion
you
now
devote
to
scotland
the
blaze
of
those
affections
which
were
hers
would
consume
your
being
did
you
not
pour
it
forth
on
your
country
were
you
not
a
patriot
grief
would
prey
upon
your
life
you
have
read
me
edwin
replied
wallace
and
that
you
may
never
love
to
idolatry
learn
this
also
though
scotland
lay
in
ruins
i
was
happy
i
felt
no
captivity
while
in
marion
arms
even
oppression
was
forgotten
when
she
made
the
sufferer
tears
cease
to
flow
she
absorbed
my
thoughts
my
wishes
my
life
she
was
wrested
from
me
that
i
might
feel
myself
a
slave
that
the
iron
might
enter
into
my
soul
with
which
i
was
to
pull
down
tyranny
and
free
my
country
mark
the
sacrifice
young
man
cried
wallace
starting
on
his
feet
it
now
even
smokes
and
the
flames
are
here
inextinguishable
he
struck
his
hand
upon
his
breast
never
love
as
i
have
loved
and
you
will
be
a
patriot
without
needing
to
taste
my
bitter
cup
edwin
trembled
his
tears
were
checked
i
can
love
no
one
better
than
i
do
you
my
general
and
is
there
any
crime
in
that
wallace
in
a
moment
recovered
from
the
transient
wildness
which
had
possessed
him
none
my
edwin
replied
he
the
affections
are
never
criminal
but
when
by
their
excess
they
blind
us
to
other
duties
the
offense
of
mine
is
judged
and
i
bow
to
the
penalty
when
that
is
paid
then
may
my
ashes
sleep
in
rescued
scotland
then
may
the
god
of
victory
and
of
mercy
grant
that
the
seraph
spirits
of
my
wife
and
infant
may
meet
my
pardoned
soul
in
paradise
edwin
wept
afresh
cease
dear
boy
said
he
these
presages
are
very
comforting
they
whisper
that
the
path
of
glory
leads
thy
brother
to
his
home
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
arm
of
the
silent
edwin
whose
sensibility
locked
up
the
powers
of
speech
and
putting
it
through
his
they
descended
the
hill
together
on
the
open
ground
before
the
great
tower
they
were
met
by
murray
i
come
to
seek
you
cried
he
we
have
had
woe
on
woe
in
the
citadel
since
you
left
it
nothing
very
calamitous
returned
wallace
if
we
may
guess
by
the
merry
aspect
of
the
messenger
only
a
little
whirlwind
of
my
aunt
in
which
we
have
had
airs
and
showers
enough
to
wet
us
through
and
blow
us
dry
again
the
conduct
of
the
lady
had
been
even
more
extravagant
than
her
nephew
chose
to
describe
after
the
knight
departure
when
the
chiefs
entered
into
conversation
respecting
his
future
plans
and
lennox
mentioned
that
when
his
men
should
arrive
for
whom
he
had
that
evening
dispatched
ker
it
was
wallace
intention
to
march
immediately
for
stirling
whither
it
could
hardly
be
doubted
aymer
de
valence
had
fled
i
shall
be
left
here
continued
the
earl
to
assist
you
lord
mar
in
the
severer
duties
attendant
on
being
governor
of
this
place
no
sooner
did
these
words
reach
the
ears
of
the
countess
than
struck
with
despair
she
hastened
toward
her
husband
and
earnestly
exclaimed
you
will
not
suffer
this
no
returned
the
earl
mistaking
her
meaning
not
being
able
to
perform
the
duties
attendant
on
the
responsibilities
station
with
which
wallace
would
honor
me
i
shall
relinquish
it
altogether
to
lord
lennox
and
be
amply
satisfied
in
finding
myself
under
his
protection
ah
where
is
protection
without
sir
william
wallace
cried
she
if
he
go
our
enemies
will
return
who
then
will
repel
them
from
these
walls
who
will
defend
your
wife
and
only
son
from
falling
again
into
the
hands
of
our
doubly
incensed
foes
mar
observed
lord
lennox
color
at
this
imputation
on
his
bravery
and
shocked
at
the
affront
which
his
unreflecting
wife
seemed
to
give
so
gallant
a
chief
he
hastily
replied
though
this
wounded
arm
can
not
boast
yet
the
earl
of
lennox
is
an
able
representative
of
our
commander
i
will
die
madam
interrupted
lennox
before
anything
hostile
approaches
you
or
your
children
she
attended
slightly
to
this
pledge
and
again
addressed
her
lord
with
fresh
arguments
for
the
detention
of
wallace
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
impatient
under
all
this
foolery
as
he
justly
deemed
it
abruptly
said
be
assured
fair
lady
israel
samson
was
not
brought
into
the
world
his
duty
better
than
allow
himself
to
be
tied
to
any
nursery
girdle
in
christendom
the
brave
old
earl
was
offended
with
this
roughness
but
ere
he
could
so
express
himself
the
object
darted
her
own
severe
retort
on
kirkpatrick
and
then
turning
to
her
husband
with
an
hysterical
sob
exclaimed
it
is
well
seen
what
will
be
my
fate
when
wallace
is
gone
would
he
have
stood
by
and
beheld
me
thus
insulted
distressed
with
shame
at
her
conduct
and
anxious
to
remove
her
fears
lord
mar
softly
whispered
her
and
threw
his
arm
about
her
waist
she
thrust
him
from
her
you
care
not
what
may
become
of
me
and
my
heart
disdains
your
blandishments
lennox
rose
in
silence
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
chamber
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
followed
him
muttering
pretty
audibly
his
thanks
to
andrew
that
he
had
never
been
yoked
with
a
wife
scrymgeour
and
murray
tried
to
allay
the
storm
in
her
bosom
by
circumstantially
detailing
how
the
fortress
must
be
equally
safe
under
the
care
of
lennox
as
of
wallace
but
they
discoursed
in
vain
she
was
obstinate
and
at
last
left
the
room
in
a
passion
of
tears
on
the
return
of
wallace
lord
lennox
advanced
to
meet
him
what
shall
we
do
said
he
without
you
have
the
witchcraft
of
hercules
and
can
be
in
two
places
at
once
i
fear
we
must
either
leave
the
rest
of
scotland
to
fight
for
itself
or
never
restore
peace
to
this
castle
wallace
smiled
but
before
he
could
answer
lady
mar
having
heard
his
voice
ascending
the
stairs
suddenly
entered
the
room
she
held
her
infant
in
her
arms
her
air
was
composed
but
her
eyes
yet
shone
in
tears
at
this
sight
lord
lennox
sufficiently
disgusted
with
the
lady
taking
murray
by
the
arm
withdrew
with
him
from
the
apartment
she
approached
wallace
you
are
come
my
deliverer
to
speak
comfort
to
the
mother
of
this
poor
babe
my
cruel
lord
here
and
the
earl
of
lennox
say
you
mean
to
abandon
us
in
this
castle
it
can
not
be
abandoned
returned
the
chief
while
they
are
in
it
but
if
so
warlike
a
scene
alarms
you
would
not
a
religious
not
for
worlds
cried
she
interrupting
him
what
altar
is
held
sacred
by
the
enemies
of
our
country
o
wonder
not
then
added
she
putting
her
face
to
that
of
her
child
that
i
should
wish
this
innocent
babe
never
to
be
from
under
the
wing
of
such
a
protector
but
that
is
impossible
joanna
rejoined
the
earl
sir
william
wallace
has
duties
to
perform
superior
to
that
of
keeping
watch
over
any
private
family
his
presence
is
wanted
in
the
field
and
we
should
be
traitors
to
the
cause
did
we
detain
him
unfeeling
mar
cried
she
bursting
into
tears
thus
to
echo
the
words
of
the
barbarian
kirkpatrick
thus
to
condemn
us
to
die
you
will
see
another
tragedy
your
own
wife
and
child
seized
by
the
returning
southrons
and
laid
bleeding
at
your
feet
wallace
walked
from
her
much
agitated
rather
inhuman
joanna
whispered
lord
mar
to
her
in
an
angry
voice
to
make
such
a
reference
to
the
presence
of
our
protector
i
can
not
stay
to
listen
to
a
pertinacity
as
insulting
to
the
rest
of
our
brave
leaders
as
it
is
oppressive
to
sir
william
wallace
edwin
you
will
come
for
me
when
your
aunt
consents
to
be
guided
by
right
reason
while
yet
speaking
he
entered
the
passage
that
led
to
his
own
apartment
lady
mar
sat
a
few
minutes
silent
she
was
not
to
be
warned
from
her
determination
by
the
displeasure
of
a
husband
whom
she
now
regarded
with
the
impatience
of
a
bondwoman
toward
her
taskmaster
and
only
solicitous
to
compass
the
detention
of
sir
william
wallace
she
resolved
if
he
would
not
remain
at
the
castle
to
persuade
him
to
conduct
her
himself
to
her
husband
territories
in
the
isle
of
bute
she
could
contrive
to
make
the
journey
occupy
more
than
one
day
and
for
holding
him
longer
she
would
trust
to
chance
and
her
own
inventions
with
these
resolutions
she
looked
up
edwin
was
speaking
to
wallace
what
does
he
tell
you
said
she
that
my
lord
has
left
me
in
displeasure
alas
he
comprehends
not
a
mother
anxiety
for
her
sole
remaining
child
one
of
my
sweet
twins
my
dear
daughter
died
on
my
being
brought
a
prisoner
to
this
horrid
fortress
and
to
lose
this
also
would
be
more
than
i
could
bear
look
at
this
babe
cried
she
holding
it
up
to
him
let
it
plead
to
you
for
its
life
guard
it
noble
wallace
whatever
may
become
of
me
the
appeal
of
a
mother
made
instant
way
to
sir
william
heart
even
her
weaknesses
did
they
point
to
anxiety
respecting
her
offspring
were
sacred
with
him
what
would
you
have
me
do
madam
if
you
fear
to
remain
here
tell
me
where
you
think
you
would
be
safer
and
i
will
be
your
conductor
she
paused
to
repress
the
triumph
with
which
this
proposal
filled
her
and
then
with
downcast
eyes
replied
in
the
seagirt
bute
stands
rothsay
a
rude
but
strong
castle
of
my
lord
it
possesses
nothing
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
enemy
and
there
i
might
remain
in
perfect
safety
lord
mar
may
keep
his
station
here
until
a
general
victory
sends
you
noble
wallace
to
restore
my
child
to
its
father
wallace
bowed
his
assent
to
her
proposal
and
edwin
remembering
the
earl
injunction
inquired
if
he
might
inform
him
of
what
was
decided
when
he
left
the
room
lady
mar
rose
and
suddenly
putting
her
son
into
the
arms
of
wallace
rose
and
said
let
his
sweet
caresses
thank
you
wallace
trembled
as
he
pressed
its
little
mouth
to
his
and
mistranslating
this
emotion
she
dropped
her
face
upon
the
infant
and
in
affecting
to
kiss
it
rested
her
head
upon
the
bosom
of
the
chief
there
was
something
in
this
action
more
than
maternal
it
surprised
and
disconcerted
wallace
madam
said
he
drawing
back
and
relinquishing
the
child
i
do
not
require
any
thanks
for
serving
the
wife
and
son
of
lord
mar
at
that
moment
the
earl
entered
lady
mar
flattered
herself
that
the
repelling
action
of
wallace
and
his
cold
answer
had
arisen
from
the
expectation
of
this
entrance
yet
blushing
with
something
like
disappointment
she
hastily
uttered
a
few
agitated
words
to
inform
her
husband
that
bute
was
to
be
her
future
sanctuary
lord
mar
approved
it
and
declared
his
determination
to
accompany
her
in
my
state
i
can
be
of
little
use
here
said
he
my
family
will
require
protection
even
in
that
seclusion
and
therefore
leaving
lord
lennox
sole
governor
of
dumbarton
i
shall
unquestionably
attend
them
to
rothsay
myself
this
arrangement
would
break
in
upon
the
lonely
conversations
she
had
meditated
to
have
with
wallace
and
therefore
the
countess
objected
to
the
proposal
but
none
of
her
arguments
being
admitted
by
her
lord
and
as
wallace
did
not
support
them
by
a
word
she
was
obliged
to
make
a
merit
of
necessity
and
consent
to
her
husband
being
their
companion
chapter

renfrewshire
toward
evening
the
next
day
ker
not
only
returned
with
the
earl
of
lennox
men
but
brought
with
them
sir
eustace
maxwell
of
carlaveroch
that
brave
knight
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
the
very
same
night
in
which
de
valence
fled
before
the
arms
of
wallace
across
the
clyde
and
he
no
sooner
saw
the
scottish
colors
on
the
walls
of
dumbarton
than
finding
out
who
was
their
planter
his
soul
took
fire
and
stung
with
a
generous
ambition
of
equaling
in
glory
his
equal
in
years
he
determined
to
assist
while
he
emulated
the
victor
to
this
end
he
traversed
the
adjoining
country
striving
to
enlighten
the
understandings
of
the
stupidly
satisfied
and
to
excite
the
discontented
to
revolt
with
most
he
failed
some
took
upon
them
to
lecture
him
on
fishing
in
troubled
waters
and
warned
him
if
he
would
keep
his
head
on
his
shoulders
to
wear
his
yoke
in
peace
others
thought
the
project
too
arduous
for
men
of
small
means
they
wished
well
to
the
arms
of
sir
william
wallace
and
should
he
continue
successful
would
watch
the
moment
to
aid
him
with
all
their
little
power
those
who
had
much
property
feared
to
risk
its
loss
by
embracing
a
doubtful
struggle
some
were
too
great
cowards
to
fight
for
the
rights
they
would
gladly
regain
by
the
exertions
of
others
and
others
again
who
had
families
shrunk
from
taking
part
in
a
cause
which
should
it
fail
would
not
only
put
their
lives
in
danger
but
expose
their
offspring
to
the
revenge
of
a
resentful
enemy
this
was
the
best
apology
of
any
that
had
been
offered
natural
affection
was
the
pleader
and
though
blinded
to
its
true
interest
such
weakness
had
an
amiable
source
and
so
was
pardoned
but
the
other
pleas
were
so
basely
selfish
so
undeserving
of
anything
but
scorn
that
sir
eustace
maxwell
could
not
forbear
expressing
it
when
sir
william
wallace
is
entering
full
sail
you
will
send
your
hirelings
to
tow
him
in
but
if
a
plank
could
save
him
now
you
would
not
throw
it
to
him
i
understand
you
sirs
and
shall
trouble
your
patriotism
no
more
in
short
none
but
about
a
hundred
poor
fellows
whom
outrages
had
rendered
desperate
and
a
few
brave
spirits
who
would
put
all
to
the
hazard
for
so
good
a
cause
could
be
prevailed
on
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
obey
sir
eustace
when
he
should
see
the
moment
to
conduct
them
to
sir
william
wallace
he
was
trying
his
eloquence
among
the
clan
at
lennox
when
ker
arriving
stamped
his
persuasions
with
truth
and
above
five
hundred
men
arranged
themselves
under
their
standard
maxwell
gladly
explained
himself
to
wallace
lieutenant
and
summoning
his
little
reserve
they
marched
with
flying
pennons
through
the
town
of
dumbarton
at
sight
of
so
much
larger
a
power
than
they
expected
would
venture
to
appear
in
arms
and
sanctioned
by
the
example
of
the
earl
of
lennox
whose
name
held
a
great
influence
in
those
parts
several
who
before
had
held
back
from
doubting
their
own
judgment
now
came
forward
and
nearly
eight
hundred
men
marched
into
the
fortress
so
large
a
reinforcement
was
gratefully
received
by
wallace
and
he
welcomed
maxwell
with
a
cordiality
which
inspired
that
young
knight
with
an
affection
equal
to
his
zeal
a
council
being
held
respecting
the
disposal
of
the
new
troops
it
was
decided
that
the
lennox
men
must
remain
with
their
earl
in
garrison
while
those
brought
by
maxwell
and
under
his
command
should
follow
wallace
in
the
prosecution
of
his
conquests
along
with
his
own
especial
people
these
preliminaries
being
arranged
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
dedicated
to
more
mature
deliberations
to
the
unfolding
of
the
plan
of
warfare
which
wallace
had
conceived
as
he
first
sketched
the
general
outline
of
his
design
and
then
proceeded
to
the
particulars
of
each
military
movement
he
displayed
such
comprehensiveness
of
mind
such
depths
of
penetration
clearness
of
apprehension
facility
in
expedients
promptitude
in
perceiving
and
fixing
on
the
most
favorable
points
of
attack
explaining
their
bearings
upon
the
power
of
the
enemy
and
where
the
possession
of
such
a
castle
would
compel
the
neighboring
ones
to
surrender
and
where
occupying
the
hills
with
bands
of
resolute
scots
would
be
a
more
efficient
bulwark
than
a
thousand
towers
that
maxwell
gazed
on
him
with
admiration
and
lennox
with
wonder
mar
had
seen
the
power
of
his
arms
murray
had
already
drunk
the
experience
of
a
veteran
from
his
genius
hence
they
were
not
surprised
on
hearing
that
which
filled
strangers
with
amazement
lennox
gazed
on
his
leader
youthful
countenance
doubting
whether
he
really
were
listening
to
military
plans
great
as
general
ever
formed
or
were
visited
in
vision
by
some
heroic
shade
who
offered
to
his
sleeping
fancy
designs
far
vaster
than
his
waking
faculties
could
have
conceived
he
had
thought
that
the
young
wallace
might
have
won
dumbarton
by
a
bold
stroke
and
that
when
his
invincible
courage
should
be
steered
by
stroke
and
that
when
his
invincible
courage
should
be
steered
by
graver
heads
every
success
might
be
expected
from
his
arms
and
saw
that
when
turned
to
any
cause
of
policy
the
gordian
knot
of
it
he
did
unloose
familiar
as
his
garter
he
marveled
and
said
within
himself
surely
this
man
is
born
to
be
a
sovereign
maxwell
though
equally
astonished
was
not
so
rapt
you
have
made
arms
the
study
of
your
life
inquired
he
it
was
the
study
of
my
earliest
days
returned
wallace
but
when
scotland
lost
her
freedom
as
the
sword
was
not
drawn
in
her
defense
i
looked
not
where
it
lay
i
then
studied
the
arts
of
peace
that
is
over
and
now
the
passion
of
my
soul
revives
when
the
mind
is
bent
on
one
object
only
all
becomes
clear
that
leads
to
it
zeal
in
such
cases
is
almost
genius
soon
after
these
observations
it
was
admitted
that
wallace
might
attend
lord
mar
and
his
family
on
the
morrow
to
the
isle
of
bute
when
the
dawn
broke
he
arose
from
his
heather
bed
in
the
great
tower
and
having
called
forth
twenty
of
the
bothwell
men
to
escort
their
lord
he
told
ireland
he
should
expect
to
have
a
cheering
account
of
the
wounded
on
his
return
but
to
assure
the
poor
fellows
rejoined
the
honest
soldier
that
something
of
yourself
still
keeps
watch
over
them
i
pray
you
leave
me
the
sturdy
sword
with
which
you
won
dumbarton
it
shall
be
hung
up
in
their
sight
and
a
good
soldier
wound
will
heal
by
looking
on
it
tower
within
the
fortress
of
dumbarton
is
still
called
wallace
tower
and
a
sword
is
shown
there
as
the
one
that
belonged
to
wallace
wallace
smiled
were
it
our
holy
king
david
we
might
expect
such
a
miracle
but
you
are
welcome
to
it
and
here
let
it
remain
till
i
take
it
hence
meanwhile
lend
me
yours
stephen
for
a
truer
never
fought
for
scotland
a
glow
of
conscious
valor
flushed
the
cheek
of
the
veteran
there
my
dear
lord
said
he
presenting
it
it
will
not
dishonor
your
hand
for
it
cut
down
many
a
proud
norwegian
on
the
field
of
largs
wallace
took
the
sword
and
turned
to
meet
murray
with
edwin
in
the
portal
when
they
reached
the
citadel
lennox
and
all
the
officers
in
the
garrison
were
assembled
to
bid
their
chief
a
short
adieu
wallace
spoke
to
each
separately
and
then
approaching
the
countess
led
her
down
the
rock
to
the
horses
which
were
to
convey
them
tot
he
frith
of
clyde
lord
mar
between
murray
and
edwin
followed
and
the
servants
and
guard
completed
the
suit
being
well
mounted
they
pleasantly
pursued
their
way
avoiding
all
inhabited
places
and
resting
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
hills
lord
mar
proposed
traveling
all
night
but
at
the
close
of
the
evening
his
countess
complained
of
fatigue
declaring
she
could
not
advance
further
than
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
cart
no
shelter
appeared
in
sight
excepting
a
thick
and
extensive
wood
of
hazels
but
the
air
being
mild
and
the
lady
declaring
her
inability
of
moving
on
lord
mar
at
last
became
reconciled
to
his
wife
and
son
passing
the
night
with
no
other
canopy
than
the
trees
wallace
ordered
cloaks
to
be
spread
on
the
ground
for
the
countess
and
her
women
and
seeing
them
laid
to
rest
planted
his
men
to
keep
guard
around
the
circle
the
moon
had
sunk
in
the
west
before
the
whole
of
his
little
camp
were
asleep
but
when
all
seemed
composed
he
wandered
forth
by
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
to
view
the
surrounding
country
a
country
he
had
so
often
traversed
in
his
boyish
days
a
little
onward
in
green
renfrewshire
lay
the
lands
of
his
father
but
that
ellerslie
of
his
ancestors
like
his
own
ellerslie
of
clydesdale
his
country
enemies
had
leveled
with
the
ground
he
turned
in
anguish
of
heart
toward
the
south
for
there
less
racking
remembrances
hovered
over
the
distant
hills
leaning
on
the
shattered
stump
of
an
old
tree
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
plain
which
alone
seemed
to
divide
him
from
the
venerable
sir
ronald
crawford
and
his
youthful
haunts
at
ayr
full
of
thoughts
of
her
who
used
to
share
those
happy
scenes
he
heard
a
sigh
behind
him
he
turned
round
and
beheld
a
female
figure
disappear
among
the
trees
he
stood
motionless
again
it
met
his
view
it
seemed
to
approach
a
strange
emotion
stirred
within
him
when
he
last
passed
these
borders
he
was
bringing
his
bride
from
ayr
what
then
was
this
ethereal
visitant
the
silver
light
of
the
stars
was
not
brighter
than
its
airy
robes
which
floated
in
the
wind
his
heart
paused
it
beat
violently
still
the
figure
advanced
lost
in
the
wilderness
of
his
imagination
he
exclaimed
marion
and
darted
forward
as
if
to
rush
into
her
embrace
but
it
fled
and
again
vanished
he
dropped
upon
the
ground
in
speechless
disappointment
is
false
cried
he
recovering
from
his
first
expectation
is
a
phantom
of
my
own
creating
the
pure
spirit
of
marion
would
never
fly
from
me
i
loved
her
too
well
she
would
not
thus
redouble
my
grief
but
i
shall
go
to
thee
wife
of
my
soul
cried
he
and
that
is
comfort
balm
indeed
is
the
christian
hope
such
were
his
words
such
were
his
thoughts
till
the
coldness
of
the
hour
and
the
exhaustion
of
nature
putting
a
friendly
seal
upon
his
senses
he
sunk
upon
the
bank
and
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
when
he
awoke
the
lark
was
caroling
above
his
head
and
to
his
surprise
he
found
a
plaid
was
laid
over
him
he
threw
it
off
and
beheld
edwin
seated
at
his
feet
this
has
been
your
doing
my
kind
brother
said
he
but
how
came
you
to
discover
me
i
missed
you
when
the
dawn
broke
and
at
last
found
you
here
sleeping
under
the
dew
and
has
none
else
been
astir
inquired
wallace
thinking
of
the
figure
he
had
seen
none
that
i
know
of
all
were
fast
asleep
when
i
left
the
party
wallace
began
to
fancy
that
he
had
been
laboring
under
the
impressions
of
some
powerful
dream
and
saying
no
more
he
returned
to
the
wood
finding
everybody
ready
he
took
his
station
and
setting
forth
all
proceeded
cheerfully
though
slowly
through
the
delightful
valleys
of
barochan
by
sunset
they
arrived
at
the
point
of
embarkation
the
journey
ought
to
have
been
performed
in
half
the
time
but
the
countess
petitioned
for
long
rests
a
compliance
with
which
the
younger
part
of
the
cavalcade
conceded

reluctance

for

with

as

the

for
himself
and

to
follow
with
a

of
the
men
it
was
a
fine
evening
and
they
embarked
with
everything
in
their
favor
the
boatmen
calculated
on
reaching
bute
in
a
few
hours
but
ere
they
had
been
half
an
hour
at
sea
the
wind
veering
about
obliged
them
to
woo
its
breezes
by
a
traversing
motion
which
though
it
lengthened
their
voyage
increased
its
pleasantness
by
carrying
them
often
within
near

of
the
shores
sailing
under
a
they
beheld
the
huge
irregular
rocks
of
dunoon
overhanging
the

while
from
their
projecting
brows
hung
every

which
can

whispered

keep
her

observe
how
magnificently
those
arching
cliffs
overhang
the
hollows
and
how
richly
they
are
studded
with
shells
and
no
flower
of
the
field
or
of
the
ocean
that
came
within
the
ken
of
wallace
wasted
its
sweetness
unadmired
he
assented
to
the
remarks
of
lady
mar
who
continued
to
expatiate
on
the
beauties
of
the
shores
which
they
passed
and
thus
the
hours
flew
pleasantly
away
till
turning
the
southern
point
of
the
cowal
mountains
the
scene
suddenly
changed
the
wind
which
had
gradually
been
rising
blew
a
violent
gale
from
that
part
of
the
coast
and
the
sea
being
pent
between
the
rocks
which
skirt
the
continent
and
the
northern
side
of
bute
became
so
boisterous
that
the
boatmen
began
to
think
they
should
be
driven
upon
the
rocks
of
the
island
instead
of
reaching
its
bay
wallace
tore
down
the
sails
and
laying
his
nervous
arms
to
the
oar
assisted
to
keep
the
vessel
off
the
breakers
against
which
the
waves
were
driving
her
the
sky
collected
into
a
gloom
and
while
the
teeming
clouds
seemed
descending
even
to
rest
upon
the
cracking
masts
the
swelling
of
the
ocean
threatened
to
heave
her
up
into
their
very
bosoms
lady
mar
looked
with
affright
at
the
gathering
tempest
and
with
difficulty
was
persuaded
to
retire
under
the
shelter
of
a
little
awning
the
earl
forgot
his
debility
in
the
general
terror
and
tried
to
reassure
the
boatmen
but
a
tremendous
sweep
of
the
gale
driving
the
vessel
far
across
the
head
of
bute
shot
her
past
the
mouth
of
loch
fyne
toward
the
perilous
rocks
of
arran
here
our
destruction
is
certain
cried
the
master
of
the
bark
at
the
same
time
confessing
his
ignorance
of
the
navigation
on
this
side
of
the
island
lord
mar
seizing
the
helm
from
the
stupefied
master
called
to
wallace
while
you
keep
the
men
to
their
duty
cried
he
i
will
steer
the
earl
being
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
coast
wallace
gladly
saw
the
helm
in
his
hand
but
he
had
scarcely
stepped
forward
himself
to
give
some
necessary
directions
when
a
heavy
sea
breaking
over
the
deck
carried
two
of
the
poor
mariners
overboard
wallace
instantly
threw
out
a
couple
of
ropes
then
amidst
a
spray
so
blinding
that
the
vessel
appeared
in
a
cloud
and
while
buffeted
on
each
side
by
the
raging
of
waves
which
seemed
contending
to
tear
her
to
pieces
she
lay
to
for
a
few
minutes
to
rescue
the
men
from
the
yawning
gulf
one
caught
a
rope
and
was
saved
but
the
other
was
seen
no
more
again
the
bark
was
set
loose
to
the
current
wallace
now
with
two
rowers
only
applied
his
whole
strength
to
their
aid
the
master
and
the
third
man
were
employed
in
the
unceasing
toil
of
laying
out
the
accumulating
water
while
the
anxious
chief
tugged
at
the
oar
and
watched
the
thousand
embattled
cliffs
which
threatened
destruction
his
eye
looked
for
the
vessel
that
contained
his
friends
but
the
liquid
mountains
which
rolled
around
him
prevented
all
view
and
with
hardly
a
hope
of
seeing
them
again
he
pursued
his
attempt
to
preserve
the
lives
of
those
committed
to
his
care
all
this
while
lady
mar
lay
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
having
fainted
at
the
first
alarm
of
danger
she
had
fallen
from
swoon
to
swoon
and
now
remained
almost
insensible
upon
the
bosoms
of
her
maids
in
a
moment
the
vessel
struck
with
a
great
shock
and
the
next
instant
it
seemed
to
move
with
a
velocity
incredible
the
whirpool
the
whirlpool
resounded
from
every
lip
but
again
the
rapid
motion
was
suddenly
checked
and
the
women
fancying
they
had
struck
on
the
vrekin
rock
shrieked
aloud
the
cry
and
the
terrified
words
which
accompanied
it
aroused
lady
mar
she
started
from
her
trance
and
while
the
confusion
redoubled
rushed
toward
the
dreadful
scene
the
mountainous
waves
and
lowering
clouds
borne
forward
by
the
blast
anticipated
the
dreariness
of
night
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
had
long
passed
away
and
the
deep
shadows
of
the
driving
heavens
cast
the
whole
into
a
gloom
even
more
terrific
than
absolute
darkness
while
the
high
and
beetling
rocks
towering
aloft
in
precipitous
walls
mocked
the
hopes
of
the
mariner
should
he
even
buffet
the
waters
to
reach
their
base
and
the
jagged
shingles
deeply
shelving
beneath
the
waves
or
projecting
their
pointed
summits
upward
showed
the
crew
where
the
rugged
death
would
meet
them
a
little
onward
a
thousand
massy
fragments
rent
by
former
tempests
from
their
parent
cliffs
lay
at
the
foundations
of
the
immense
acclivities
which
faced
the
cause
of
their
present
alarm
a
whirlpool
almost
as
terrific
as
that
of
scarba
the
moment
the
powerful
blast
drove
the
vessel
within
the
influence
of
the
outward
edge
of
the
first
circle
of
the
vortex
wallace
leaped
from
the
deck
on
the
rocks
and
with
the
same
rope
in
his
hand
with
which
he
had
saved
the
life
of
the
seaman
he
called
to
the
two
men
to
follow
him
who
yet
held
similar
ropes
fastened
like
his
own
to
the
prow
of
the
vessel
and
being
obeyed
they
strove
by
towing
it
along
to
stem
the
suction
of
the
current
it
was
at
this
instant
that
lady
mar
rushed
forward
upon
deck
in
for
your
life
joanna
exclaimed
the
earl
she
answered
him
not
but
looked
wildly
around
her
nowhere
could
she
see
wallace
have
i
drowned
him
cried
she
in
a
voice
of
frenzy
and
striking
the
women
from
her
who
would
have
held
her
back
let
me
clasp
him
even
in
the
deep
waters
happily
the
earl
lost
the
last
sentence
in
the
roaring
of
the
storm
wallace
wallace
cried
she
wringing
her
hands
and
still
struggling
with
her
women
at
that
moment
a
huge
wave
sinking
before
her
discovered
the
object
of
her
fears
straining
along
the
surface
of
a
rock
and
followed
by
the
men
in
the
same
laborious
task
tugging
forward
the
ropes
to
which
the
bark
was
attached
she
gazed
at
them
with
wonder
and
affright
for
notwithstanding
the
beating
of
the
elements
which
seeming
to
find
their
breasts
of
iron
and
their
feet
armed
with
some
preternatural
adhesion
to
the
cliff
they
continued
to
bear
resolutely
onward
fortunately
they
did
not
now
labor
against
the
wind
sometimes
they
pressed
forward
on
the
level
edge
of
the
rock
then
a
yawning
chasm
forced
them
to
leap
from
cliff
to
cliff
or
to
spring
on
some
more
elevated
projection
thus
contending
with
the
vortex
and
the
storm
they
at
last
arrived
at
the
doubling
of
cuthonrock
the
point
that
was
to
clear
them
of
this
minor
corie
vrekin
but
at
that
crisis
the
rope
which
wallace
held
broke
and
with
the
shock
he
fell
backward
into
the
sea
the
foremost
man
uttered
a
dreadful
cry
but
ere
it
could
be
echoed
by
his
fellows
wallace
had
risen
above
the
waves
and
beating
their
whelming
waters
with
his
invincible
arm
soon
gained
the
vessel
and
jumped
upon
the
deck
the
point
was
doubled
but
the
next
moment
the
vessel
struck
and
in
a
manner
that
left
no
hope
of
getting
her
off
all
must
take
to
the
water
or
perish
for
the
second
shock
would
scatter
her
piecemeal
means
the
mournful
sound
of
waves
again
lady
mar
appeared
at
sight
of
wallace
she
forgot
everything
but
him
and
perhaps
would
have
thrown
herself
into
his
arms
had
not
the
anxious
earl
caught
her
in
his
own
are
we
to
die
cried
she
to
wallace
in
a
voice
of
horror
i
trust
that
god
has
decreed
otherwise
was
his
reply
compose
yourself
all
may
yet
be
well
lord
mar
from
his
yet
unhealed
wounds
could
not
swim
wallace
therefore
tore
up
the
benches
of
the
rowers
and
binding
them
into
the
form
of
a
small
raft
made
it
the
vehicle
for
the
earl
and
countess
with
her
two
maids
and
the
child
while
the
men
were
towing
it
and
buffeting
with
it
through
the
breakers
he
too
threw
himself
into
the
sea
to
swim
by
its
side
and
be
in
readiness
in
case
of
accident
having
gained
the
shore
or
rather
the
broken
rocks
that
lie
at
the
foot
of
the
stupendous
craigs
which
surround
the
isle
of
arran
wallace
and
his
sturdy
assistants
conveyed
the
countess
and
her
terrified
women
up
their
acclivities
fortunately
for
the
shipwrecked
voyagers
though
the
wind
raged
its
violence
was
of
some
advantage
for
it
nearly
cleared
the
heavens
of
clouds
and
allowed
the
moon
to
send
forth
her
guiding
light
by
her
lamp
one
of
the
men
discovered
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
where
wallace
gladly
sheltered
his
dripping
charges
the
child
whom
he
had
guarded
in
his
own
arms
during
the
difficult
ascent
he
now
laid
on
the
bosom
of
its
mother
lady
mar
kissed
the
hand
that
relinquished
it
and
gave
way
to
a
flood
of
grateful
tears
the
earl
as
he
sunk
almost
powerless
against
the
side
of
the
cave
yet
had
strength
enough
to
press
wallace
to
his
heart
ever
preserver
of
me
and
mine
cried
he
how
must
i
bless
thee
wife
my
have
been
saved
to
you
my
friend
interrupted
wallace
by
the
presiding
care
of
him
who
walked
the
waves
without
his
especial
arm
we
must
all
have
perished
in
this
awful
night
therefore
let
our
thanksgivings
be
directed
to
him
alone
so
be
it
returned
the
earl
and
dropping
on
his
knees
he
breathed
forth
so
pathetic
and
sublime
a
prayer
of
thanks
that
the
countess
trembled
and
bent
her
head
upon
the
bosom
of
her
child
she
could
not
utter
the
solemn
amen
that
was
repeated
by
every
voice
in
the
cave
her
unhappy
infatuation
saw
no
higher
power
in
this
great
preservation
than
the
hand
of
the
man
she
adored
she
felt
that
guilt
was
cherished
in
her
heart
and
she
could
not
lift
her
eyes
to
join
with
those
who
with
the
boldness
of
innocence
called
on
heaven
to
attest
the
sanctity
of
their
vows
sleep
soon
sealed
every
weary
eye
excepting
those
of
wallace
a
racking
anxiety
respecting
the
fate
of
the
other
vessel
in
which
were
the
brave
men
of
bothwell
and
his
two
dear
friends
filled
his
mind
with
dreadful
forebodings
that
they
had
not
outlived
the
storm
sometimes
when
wearied
nature
for
a
few
minutes
sunk
into
slumber
he
would
start
from
the
body
of
edwin
floating
on
the
briny
flood
and
as
he
awoke
a
cold
despondence
would
tell
him
that
his
dream
was
perhaps
too
true
oh
i
love
thee
edwin
exclaimed
he
to
himself
and
if
my
devoted
heart
was
to
be
separated
from
all
but
a
patriot
love
did
i
think
of
loving
thee
thou
too
die
that
scotland
may
have
no
rival
that
wallace
may
feel
himself
quite
alone
thus
he
sat
musing
and
listening
with
many
a
sigh
to
the
yelling
gusts
of
wind
and
louder
roaring
of
the
water
at
last
the
former
gradually
subsided
and
the
latter
obeying
the
retreating
ride
rolled
away
in
hoarse
murmurs
morning
began
to
dawn
and
spreading
upon
the
mountains
of
the
opposite
shore
shed
a
soft
light
over
their
misty
sides
all
was
tranquil
and
full
of
beauty
that
element
which
so
lately
in
its
rage
had
threatened
to
ingulf
them
all
now
flowed
by
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
cave
in
gentle
undulations
and
where
the
spiral
cliffs
gave
a
little
resistance
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
striking
on
the
bursting
waves
turned
their
vapory
showers
into
dropping
gems
while
his
companions
were
still
wrapped
in
sleep
wallace
stole
away
to
seek
some
knowledge
respecting
the
part
of
the
isle
of
arran
on
which
they
were
cast
close
by
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
discovered
a
cleft
in
the
rock
into
which
he
turned
and
finding
the
upward
footing
sufficiently
secure
clambered
to
the
summit
looking
around
he
found
himself
at
the
skirt
of
a
chain
of
high
hills
which
seemed
to
stretch
from
side
to
side
over
the
island
while
their
tops
in
alpine
succession
rose
in
a
thousand
grotesque
and
pinnacled
forms
the
ptarmigan
and
capercailzie
were
screaming
from
those
upper
regions
and
the
nimble
roes
with
their
fawns
bounding
through
the
green
defiles
below
no
trace
of
human
habitation
appeared
but
from
the
size
and
known
population
of
the
island
he
knew
he
could
not
be
far
from
inhabitants
and
thinking
it
best
to
send
the
boatmen
in
search
of
them
he
retraced
his
steps
the
morning
vapors
were
fast
rolling
their
snowy
wreaths
down
the
opposite
mountains
whose
heads
shining
in
resplendent
purple
seemed
to
view
themselves
in
the
bright
reflections
of
the
now
smooth
sea
nature
like
a
proud
conqueror
appeared
to
have
put
on
a
triumphal
garb
in
exultation
of
the
devastation
she
had
committed
the
night
before
wallace
shuddered
as
the
parallel
occurred
to
his
mind
and
turned
from
the
scene
on
the
cave
he
dispatched
the
seamen
and
disposed
himself
to
watch
by
the
sides
of
his
still
sleeping
friends
an
hour
hardly
had
elapsed
before
the
men
returned
bringing
with
them
a
large
boat
and
its
proprietor
but
alas
no
tidings
of
murray
and
edwin
whom
he
had
hoped
might
have
been
driven
somewhere
on
the
island
in
bringing
the
boat
round
to
the
creek
under
the
rock
the
men
discovered
that
the
sea
had
driven
their
wreck
between
two
projecting
rocks
where
it
now
lay
wedged
though
ruined
as
a
vessel
sufficient
held
together
to
warrant
their
exertions
to
save
the
property
accordingly
they
entered
it
and
drew
thence
most
of
the
valuables
which
belonged
to
lord
mar
while
this
was
doing
wallace
reascended
to
the
cave
and
finding
the
earl
awake
told
him
a
boat
was
ready
for
their
but
where
my
friend
are
my
nephews
inquired
he
alas
has
this
fatal
expedition
robbed
me
of
them
wallace
tried
to
inspire
him
with
a
hope
he
scarcely
dare
credit
himself
that
they
had
been
saved
on
some
more
distant
shore
the
voices
of
the
chiefs
awakened
the
women
but
the
countess
still
slept
aware
that
she
would
resist
trusting
herself
to
the
waves
again
lord
mar
desired
that
she
might
be
moved
on
board
without
disturbing
her
this
was
readily
done
the
men
having
only
to
take
up
the
extremities
of
the
plaid
on
to
the
boat
the
earl
received
her
head
on
his
bosom
all
were
then
on
board
the
rowers
struck
their
oars
and
once
more
the
little
party
found
themselves
launched
upon
the
sea
while
they
were
yet
midway
between
the
isles
with
a
bright
sun
playing
its
sparkling
beams
upon
the
gently
rippling
waves
the
countess
heaving
a
deep
sigh
slowly
opened
her
eyes
all
around
glared
with
the
light
of
day
she
felt
the
motion
of
the
boat
and
raising
her
head
saw
that
she
was
again
embarked
on
the
treacherous
element
on
which
she
had
lately
experienced
so
many
terrors
she
grew
deadly
pale
and
grasped
her
husband
hand
my
dear
joanna
cried
he
be
not
alarmed
we
are
all
safe
and
sir
william
wallace
has
left
us
demanded
she
no
madam
answered
a
voice
from
the
steerage
not
till
this
party
is
safe
at
bute
do
i
quit
it
she
looked
round
with
a
grateful
smile
ever
generous
how
could
i
for
a
moment
doubt
our
preserver
wallace
bowed
but
remained
silent
and
they
passed
calmly
along
till
the
vessel
came
in
sight
of
a
birling
which
bounding
over
the
waves
was
presently
so
near
the
earl
that
the
figures
in
each
could
be
distinctly
seen
in
it
the
chiefs
to
their
rapturous
surprise
beheld
murray
and
edwin
the
latter
with
a
cry
of
joy
leaped
into
the
sea
the
next
instant
he
was
over
the
boat
side
and
clasped
in
the
arms
of
wallace
real
transport
true
happiness
now
dilated
the
heart
of
the
before
desponding
chief
he
pressed
the
dear
boy
again
and
again
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
his
white
forehead
with
all
the
rapture
of
the
fondest
brother
thank
god
thank
god
was
all
that
edwin
could
say
while
at
every
effort
to
tear
himself
from
wallace
to
congratulate
his
uncle
on
his
safety
his
heart
overflowing
toward
his
friend
opened
afresh
and
he
clung
the
closer
to
his
breast
till
at
last
exhausted
with
happiness
the
little
hero
of
dumbarton
gave
way
to
the
sensibility
of
his
tender
age
and
the
chief
felt
his
bosom
wet
with
the
joy
drawn
tears
of
his
youthful
banneret
while
this
was
passing
the
birling
had
drawn
close
to
the
boat
and
murray
shaking
hands
with
his
uncle
and
aunt
exclaimed
to
wallace
that
urchin
is
such
a
monopolizer
i
see
you
have
not
a
greeting
for
any
one
else
on
this
edwin
raised
his
face
and
turned
to
the
affectionate
welcomes
of
lord
mar
wallace
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
lord
andrew
and
inviting
him
into
the
boat
soon
learned
that
on
the
portentous
beginning
of
the
storm
company
made
direct
to
the
nearest
creek
in
bute
being
better
seamen
than
wallace
helmsman
who
until
danger
stopped
him
had
foolishly
continued
to
aim
for
rothsay
by
this
prudence
without
having
been
in
much
peril
or
sustained
any
fatigue
murray
party
had
landed
safely
the
night
came
on
dark
and
tremendous
but
not
doubting
that
the
earl
rowers
had
carried
him
into
a
similar
haven
the
young
chief
and
his
companion
kept
themselves
very
easy
in
a
fisher
hut
till
morning
at
an
early
hour
they
then
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
bothwell
men
and
expecting
they
should
come
up
with
wallace
and
his
party
at
rothsay
walked
over
to
the
castle
their
consternation
was
unutterable
when
they
found
that
lord
mar
was
not
there
threw
themselves
into
a
birling
to
seek
their
friends
upon
the
seas
and
when
they
did
espy
them
the
joy
of
edwin
was
so
great
that
not
even
the
unfathomable
gulf
could
stop
him
from
flying
to
the
embrace
of
his
friend
is
a
small
boat
generally
used
by
fishers
while
mutual
felicitations
passed
the
boats
now
nearly
side
by
side
reached
the
shore
and
the
seamen
jumping
on
the
rocks
moored
their
vessels
under
the
projecting
towers
of
rothsay
the
old
steward
hastened
to
receive
a
master
who
had
not
blessed
his
aged
eyes
for
many
a
year
a
master
who
had
the
infant
in
his
arms
that
was
to
be
the
future
representative
of
the
house
of
mar
he
wept
aloud
the
earl
spoke
to
him
affectionately
and
then
walked
on
with
edwin
whom
he
called
to
support
him
up
the
bank
murray
led
the
countess
out
of
the
boat
while
the
bothwell
men
so
thronged
about
wallace
congratulating
themselves
on
his
safety
that
she
saw
there
was
no
hope
of
his
arm
being
then
offered
to
her
having
entered
the
castle
the
steward
led
them
into
a
room
in
which
he
had
spread
a
plentiful
repast
here
murray
having
recounted
the
adventures
of
his
voyage
called
for
a
history
of
what
had
befallen
his
friends
the
earl
gladly
took
up
the
tale
and
with
many
a
glance
of
gratitude
to
wallace
narrated
the
perilous
events
of
their
shipwreck
and
providential
preservation
on
the
isle
of
arran
happiness
now
seemed
to
have
shed
her
heavenly
influence
over
every
bosom
all
hearts
owned
the
grateful
effects
of
the
late
rescue
the
rapturous
joy
of
edwin
burst
into
a
thousand
sallies
of
ardent
and
luxurious
imagination
the
high
spirits
of
murray
turned
every
transient
subject
into
a
jest
the
veteran
earl
seemed
restored
to
health
and
to
youth
and
wallace
felt
the
sun
of
consolation
expanding
in
his
bosom
he
had
met
a
heart
though
a
young
one
on
which
his
soul
might
repose
that
dear
selected
brother
of
his
affection
was
saved
from
the
whelming
waves
and
all
his
superstitious
dreams
of
a
mysterious
doom
vanished
before
this
manifestation
of
heavenly
goodness
his
friend
too
the
gallant
murray
was
spared
how
many
subjects
had
he
for
unmurmuring
gratitude
and
with
an
unclouded
brow
and
a
happy
spirit
he
yielded
to
the
impulse
of
the
scene
he
smiled
and
with
an
endearing
graciousness
listened
to
every
fond
speaker
while
his
own
ingenuous
replies
bespoke
the
treasures
of
love
which
sorrow
in
her
cruelest
aspect
had
locked
within
his
heart
the
complacency
with
which
he
regarded
every
one
the
pouring
out
of
his
beneficent
spirit
which
seemed
to
embrace
all
like
his
dearest
kindred
turned
every
eye
and
heart
toward
him
as
to
the
source
of
every
bliss
as
to
a
being
who
seemed
made
to
love
and
be
beloved
by
every
one
lady
mar
looked
at
him
listened
to
him
with
her
rapt
soul
seated
in
her
eyes
in
his
presence
all
was
transport
but
when
he
withdrew
for
the
night
what
was
then
the
state
of
her
feelings
the
overflowing
of
heart
he
felt
for
all
she
appropriated
solely
for
herself
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
the
unutterable
expression
of
his
countenance
while
as
he
spoke
he
veiled
his
eyes
under
their
long
brown
lashes
had
raised
such
vague
hopes
in
her
bosom
that
he
being
gone
she
hastened
her
adieus
to
the
rest
eager
to
retire
to
bed
and
there
uninterruptedly
muse
on
the
happiness
of
having
at
last
touched
the
heart
of
a
man
for
whom
she
would
resign

chapter
xxviii
isle
of
bute
the
morning
would
have
brought
annihilation
to
the
hopes
had
not
murray
been
the
first
to
meet
her
as
she
came
from
her
chamber
while
walking
on
the
cliffs
at
some
distance
from
the
castle
to
observe
the
weather
he
met
wallace
and
edwin
they
had
already
been
across
the
valley
to
the
haven
and
ordered
a
boat
round
to
convey
them
back
to
gourock
postpone
your
flight
for
pity
sake
cried
murray
if
you
would
not
by
discourtesy
destroy
what
your
gallantry
has
preserved
he
then
told
them
that
lady
mar
was
preparing
a
feast
in
the
glen
behind
the
castle
and
if
you
do
not
stay
to
partake
it
added
he
we
may
expect
all
the
witches
in
the
isle
will
be
bribed
to
sink
us
before
we
reach
the
shore
after
this
the
general
meeting
of
the
morning
was
not
less
cordial
than
the
separation
of
the
night
before
and
when
lady
mar
withdrew
to
give
orders
for
her
rural
banquet
that
time
was
seized
by
the
earl
for
the
arrangement
of
matters
of
more
consequence
in
a
private
conversation
with
murray
the
preceding
evening
he
had
learned
that
just
before
the
party
left
dumbarton
a
letter
had
been
sent
to
helen
at
filan
informing
her
of
the
taking
of
the
castle
and
of
the
safety
of
her
friends
this
having
satisfied
the
earl
he
did
not
advert
to
her
at
all
in
his
present
discourse
with
wallace
but
rather
avoided
encumbering
his
occupied
mind
with
anything
but
the
one
great
theme
while
the
earl
and
his
friends
were
marshaling
armies
taking
towns
and
storming
castles
the
countess
intent
on
other
conquests
was
meaning
to
beguile
and
destroy
that
manly
spirit
by
soft
delights
which
a
continuance
in
war
rugged
scenes
she
thought
was
too
likely
to
render
invulnerable
when
her
lord
and
his
guests
were
summoned
to
the
feast
she
met
them
at
the
mouth
of
the
glen
having
tried
the
effect
of
splendor
she
now
left
all
to
the
power
of
her
natural
charms
and
appeared
simply
clad
in
her
favorite
green
moraig
the
pretty
grandchild
of
the
steward
walked
beside
her
like
the
fairy
queen
of
the
scene
so
gayly
was
she
decorated
in
all
the
flowers
of
spring
here
is
the
lady
of
my
elfin
revels
holding
her
little
king
in
her
arms
as
the
countess
spoke
moraig
held
up
the
infant
to
lady
mar
dressed
like
herself
in
a
tissue
gathered
from
the
field
the
sweet
babe
laughed
and
crowed
and
made
a
spring
to
leap
into
wallace
arms
the
chief
took
him
and
with
an
affectionate
smile
pressed
his
little
cheek
to
his
though
he
had
felt
the
repugnance
of
a
delicate
mind
and
the
shuddering
of
a
man
who
held
his
person
consecrated
to
the
memory
of
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
though
he
had
felt
these
sentiments
mingle
into
an
abhorrence
of
the
countess
when
she
allowed
her
head
to
drop
on
his
breast
in
the
citadel
and
though
while
he
remained
at
dumbarton
without
absolutely
charging
her
to
himself
with
anything
designedly
immodest
he
had
certainly
avoided
her
yet
since
the
wreck
the
danger
she
had
escaped
the
general
joy
of
all
meeting
again
had
wiped
away
even
the
remembrance
of
his
former
cause
of
dislike
and
he
now
sat
by
her
as
by
a
sister
fondling
her
child
although
at
every
sweet
caress
it
reminded
him
of
what
might
have
been
his
of
hopes
lost
to
him
forever
the
repast
over
the
piper
of
the
adjacent
cottages
appeared
and
placing
himself
on
a
projecting
rock
at
the
carol
of
his
merry
instrument
the
young
peasants
of
both
sexes
jocundly
came
forward
and
began
to
dance
at
this
sight
edwin
seized
the
little
hand
of
moraig
while
lord
andrew
called
a
pretty
lass
from
amongst
the
rustics
and
joined
the
group
the
happy
earl
with
many
a
hearty
laugh
enjoyed
the
jollity
of
his
people
and
while
the
steward
stood
at
his
back
describing
whose
sons
and
daughters
passed
before
him
in
the
reel
mar
remembered
their
parents
their
fathers
once
his
companions
in
the
chase
or
on
the
wave
and
their
mothers
the
pretty
maidens
he
used
to
pursue
over
the
hills
in
the
merry
time
of
shealing
lady
mar
watched
the
countenance
of
wallace
as
he
looked
upon
the
joyous
group
it
was
placid
and
a
soft
complacency
illumined
his
eye
how
different
was
the
expression
in
hers
had
he
marked
it
all
within
her
was
in
tumult
and
the
characters
were
but
too
legibly
imprinted
on
her
face
but
he
did
not
look
on
her
for
the
child
whom
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
overpowered
began
to
cry
he
rose
and
having
resigned
it
to
the
nurse
turned
into
a
narrow
vista
of
trees
where
he
walked
slowly
on
unconscious
whither
he
went
lady
mar
with
an
eager
though
almost
aimless
haste
followed
him
with
a
light
step
till
she
saw
him
turn
out
of
the
vista
and
then
she
lost
sight
of
him
to
walk
with
him
undisturbed
in
so
deep
a
seclusion
to
improve
the
impression
which
she
was
sure
she
had
made
upon
his
heart
to
teach
him
which
she
was
sure
she
had
made
upon
his
heart
to
teach
him
to
forget
his
marion
in
the
hope
of
one
day
possessing
her
all
these
thoughts
ran
in
this
vain
woman
head
and
inwardly
rejoicing
that
the
shattered
health
of
her
husband
promised
her
a
ready
freedom
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
to
whom
she
would
gladly
belong
in
honor
or
in
dishonor
she
hastened
forward
as
if
the
accomplishment
of
her
wishes
depended
on
this
meeting
peeping
through
the
trees
she
saw
him
standing
with
folded
arms
looking
intently
into
the
bosom
of
a
large
lake
but
the
place
was
so
thickly
surrounded
with
willows
she
could
only
perceive
him
at
intervals
when
the
wind
tossed
aside
the
branches
having
stood
for
some
time
he
walked
on
several
times
she
essayed
to
emerge
and
join
him
but
a
sudden
awe
of
him
a
conviction
of
that
saintly
purity
which
would
shrink
from
the
guilty
vows
she
was
meditating
to
pour
into
his
ear
a
recollection
of
the
ejaculation
with
which
he
had
accosted
her
before
hovering
figure
when
she
haunted
his
footsteps
on
the
banks
of
the
cart
these
thoughts
made
her
pause
he
might
again
mistake
her
for
the
same
dear
object
this
image
it
was
not
her
interest
to
recall
and
to
approach
near
him
to
unveil
her
heat
to
him
and
to
be
repulsed
there
was
madness
in
the
idea
and
she
retreated
she
had
no
sooner
returned
to
the
scene
of
festivity
than
she
repented
of
having
allowed
what
she
deemed
an
idle
alarm
of
overstrained
delicacy
to
drive
her
from
the
lake
she
would
have
hastened
back
had
not
two
or
three
aged
female
peasants
almost
instantly
engaged
her
in
spite
of
her
struggles
for
extrication
to
listen
to
long
stories
respecting
her
lord
youth
she
remained
thus
an
unwilling
auditor
and
by
the
side
of
the
dancers
for
nearly
an
hour
before
wallace
reappeared
but
then
she
sprung
toward
him
as
if
a
spell
were
broken
where
truant
have
you
been
in
a
beautiful
solitude
returned
he
amongst
a
luxuriant
grove
of
willows
ah
cried
she
it
is
called
glenshealeach
and
a
sad
scene
was
acted
there
about
ten
years
ago
a
lady
of
this
island
drowned
herself
in
the
lake
they
hang
over
because
the
man
she
loved
despised
her
unhappy
woman
observed
wallace
then
you
would
have
pitied
her
rejoined
lady
mar
he
can
not
be
a
man
that
would
not
pity
a
woman
under
such
circumstances
then
you
would
not
have
consigned
her
to
such
a
fate
wallace
was
startled
by
the
peculiar
tone
in
which
this
simple
question
was
asked
it
recalled
the
action
in
the
citadel
and
unconsciously
turning
a
penetrating
look
on
her
his
eyes
met
hers
he
need
not
have
heard
further
to
have
learned
more
she
hastily
looked
down
and
colored
and
he
wishing
to
misunderstand
a
language
so
disgraceful
to
herself
so
dishonoring
to
her
husband
gave
some
trifling
answer
then
making
a
slight
observation
about
the
earl
he
advanced
to
him
lord
mar
was
become
tired
with
so
gala
a
scene
and
taking
the
arm
of
wallace
they
returned
together
into
the
house
edwin
soon
followed
with
murray
gladly
arriving
in
time
enough
to
see
their
little
pinnacle
draw
up
under
the
castle
and
throw
out
her
moorings
the
countess
too
descried
its
streamers
and
hastening
into
the
room
where
she
knew
the
chiefs
were
yet
assembled
though
the
wearied
earl
had
retired
to
repose
inquired
the
reason
of
that
boat
having
drawn
so
near
the
castle
that
it
may
take
us
from
it
fair
aunt
replied
murray
the
countess
fixed
her
eyes
with
an
unequivocal
expression
upon
wallace
my
gratitude
is
ever
due
to
your
kindness
noble
lady
said
he
still
wishing
to
be
blind
to
what
he
could
not
perceive
and
that
we
may
ever
deserve
it
we
must
keep
the
enemy
from
your
doors
yes
added
murray
and
to
keep
a
more
insidious
foe
from
our
own
edwin
and
i
feel
it
rather
dangerous
to
bask
too
long
in
these
sunny
bowers
but
surely
your
chief
is
not
afraid
said
she
casting
a
soft
glance
at
wallace
yet
nevertheless
i
must
fly
returned
he
bowing
to
her
that
you
positively
shall
not
added
she
with
a
fluttering
joy
at
her
heart
thinking
she
was
about
to
succeed
you
stir
not
this
night
else
i
shall
brand
you
all
as
a
band
of
cowards
call
us
by
every
name
in
the
poltroon
calendar
cried
murray
seeing
by
the
countenance
of
wallace
that
his
resolution
was
not
to
be
moved
yet
i
must
gallop
off
from
your
judith
as
if
chased
by
the
ghost
of
holofernes
himself
so
dear
aunt
rejoined
edwin
smiling
if
you
do
not
mean
to
play
circe
to
our
ulysses
give
us
leave
to
go
lady
mar
started
confused
she
knew
not
how
as
he
innocently
uttered
these
words
the
animated
boy
snatched
a
kiss
from
her
hand
when
he
ceased
speaking
and
darted
after
murray
who
had
disappeared
to
give
some
speeding
directions
respecting
the
boat
left
thus
alone
with
the
object
of
her
every
wish
in
the
moment
when
she
thought
she
was
going
to
lose
him
perhaps
forever
she
forgot
all
prudence
all
reserve
and
laying
her
hand
on
her
arm
as
with
a
respectful
bow
he
was
also
moving
away
she
arrested
his
steps
she
held
him
fast
but
her
agitation
prevented
her
speaking
she
trembled
violently
and
weeping
dropped
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
he
was
motionless
her
tears
redoubled
he
felt
the
embarrassment
of
his
situation
and
at
last
extricating
his
tongue
which
surprise
and
shame
for
her
had
chained
in
a
gentle
voice
he
inquired
the
cause
of
her
uneasiness
if
for
the
safety
of
your
no
no
cried
she
interrupting
him
read
my
fate
in
that
of
the
lady
of
glenshealeach
again
he
was
silent
astonished
fearful
of
too
promptly
understanding
so
disgraceful
a
truth
he
found
no
words
in
which
to
answer
her
and
her
emotions
became
so
uncontrolled
that
he
expected
she
would
swoon
in
his
arms
cruel
cruel
wallace
at
last
cried
she
clinging
to
him
for
he
had
once
or
twice
attempted
to
disengage
himself
and
reseat
her
on
the
bench
your
heart
is
steeled
or
it
would
understand
mine
it
would
at
least
pity
the
wretchedness
it
has
created
but
i
am
despised
and
i
can
yet
find
the
watery
grave
from
which
you
rescued
me
to
dissemble
longer
would
have
been
folly
wallace
now
resolutely
seating
her
though
with
gentleness
addressed
her
your
husband
lady
mar
is
my
friend
had
i
even
a
heart
to
give
a
woman
not
one
sigh
should
arise
in
it
to
his
dishonor
but
i
am
lost
to
all
warmer
affections
than
that
of
friendship
i
may
regard
man
as
my
brother
woman
as
my
sister
but
never
more
can
i
look
on
female
form
with
love
lady
mar
tears
now
flowed
in
a
more
tempered
current
but
were
it
otherwise
cried
she
only
tell
me
that
had
i
not
been
bound
with
chains
which
my
kinsmen
forced
upon
me
had
i
not
been
made
the
property
of
a
man
who
however
estimable
was
of
too
paternal
years
for
me
to
love
ah
tell
me
if
these
tears
should
now
flow
in
vain
wallace
seemed
to
hesitate
what
to
answer
wrought
up
to
agony
she
threw
herself
on
his
breast
exclaiming
answer
but
drive
me
not
to
despair
i
never
loved
man
before
and
now
to
be
scorned
oh
kill
me
too
dear
wallace
but
tell
me
not
that
you
never
could
have
loved
me
wallace
was
alarmed
at
her
vehemence
lady
mar
returned
he
i
am
incapable
of
saying
anything
to
you
that
is
inimical
to
your
duty
to
the
best
of
men
i
will
even
forget
this
distressing
conversation
and
continue
through
life
to
revere
equal
with
himself
the
wife
of
my
friend
and
i
am
to
be
stabbed
with
this
she
replied
in
a
voice
of
indignant
anguish
you
are
to
be
healed
with
it
lady
mar
returned
he
for
it
is
not
a
man
like
the
rest
of
his
sex
that
now
addresses
you
but
a
being
whose
heart
is
petrified
to
marble
i
could
feel
no
throb
of
yours
i
should
be
insensible
to
all
your
charms
were
i
even
vile
enough
to
see
no
evil
in
trampling
upon
your
husband
rights
yes
were
virtue
lost
to
me
still
memory
would
speak
still
would
she
urge
that
the
chaste
and
last
kiss
imprinted
by
my
wife
on
these
lips
should
live
there
in
unblemished
sanctity
till
i
again
meet
her
angel
embraces
in
the
world
to
come
the
countess
awed
by
his
solemnity
but
not
put
from
her
suit
exclaimed
what
she
was
i
would
be
to
thee
thy
consoler
thine
adorer
time
may
set
me
free
oh
till
then
only
give
me
leave
to
love
thee
and
i
shall
be
happy
you
dishonor
yourself
lady
returned
he
by
these
petitions
and
for
what
you
plunge
your
soul
in
guilty
wishes
you
sacrifice
your
peace
and
your
to
a
phantom
for
i
repeat
i
am
dead
to
woman
and
the
voice
of
love
sounds
like
the
funeral
knell
of
her
who
will
never
breathe
it
to
me
again
he
arose
as
he
spoke
and
the
countess
pierced
to
the
heart
and
almost
despairing
of
now
retaining
any
part
in
its
esteem
was
devising
what
next
to
say
when
murray
came
into
the
room
wallace
instantly
observed
that
his
countenance
was
troubled
what
has
happened
inquired
he
a
messenger
from
the
mainland
with
bad
news
from
ayr
of
private
or
public
import
asked
wallace
of
both
there
has
been
a
horrid
massacre
in
which
the
heads
of
many
noble
families
have
fallen
as
he
spoke
the
paleness
of
his
countenance
revealed
to
his
friend
that
part
of
the
information
he
had
found
himself
unable
to
communicate
i
comprehend
my
loss
cried
wallace
sir
ronald
crawford
is
sacrificed
bring
the
messenger
in
murray
withdrew
and
wallace
seating
himself
remained
with
a
fixed
and
stern
countenance
gazing
on
the
ground
lady
mar
durst
not
breathe
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
horrid
stillness
which
seemed
to
lock
up
his
grief
and
indignation
lord
andrew
with
a
stranger
wallace
rose
to
meet
him
and
seeing
lady
countess
said
he
these
bloody
recitals
are
not
for
your
ears
and
waving
her
to
withdraw
she
left
the
room
this
gallant
stranger
said
murray
is
sir
john
graham
he
has
just
left
that
new
theater
of
southron
perfidy
i
have
hastened
hither
cried
the
knight
to
call
your
victorious
arm
to
take
a
signal
vengeance
on
the
murderers
of
your
grandfather
he
and
eighteen
other
scottish
chiefs
have
been
treacherously
put
to
death
in
the
barns
of
ayr
graham
then
gave
a
brief
narration
of
the
direful
circumstance
he
and
his
father
lord
dundaff
having
crossed
the
south
coast
of
scotland
on
their
way
homeward
stopped
to
rest
at
ayr
they
arrived
there
the
very
day
that
lord
aymer
de
valence
had
entered
it
a
fugitive
from
dumbarton
castle
much
as
that
earl
wished
to
keep
the
success
of
wallace
a
secret
from
the
inhabitants
of
ayr
he
found
it
impossible
two
or
three
fugitive
soldiers
whispered
the
hard
fighting
they
had
endured
and
in
half
an
hour
after
the
arrival
of
the
english
earl
every
one
knew
that
the
recovery
of
scotland
was
begun
elated
with
this
intelligence
the
scots
went
under
night
from
house
to
house
congratulating
each
other
on
so
miraculous
an
interference
in
their
favor
and
many
stole
to
sir
ronald
crawford
to
felicitate
the
venerable
knight
on
his
glorious
grandson
the
good
old
man
listened
with
meek
joy
to
their
animated
eulogiums
on
wallace
and
when
lord
dundaff
in
offering
his
congratulations
with
the
rest
said
but
while
all
scotland
lay
in
vassalage
where
did
he
imbibe
this
spirit
to
tread
down
tyrants
the
venerable
patriarch
replied
he
was
always
a
noble
boy
in
infancy
he
became
the
defender
of
every
child
he
saw
oppressed
by
boys
of
greater
power
he
was
even
the
champion
of
the
brute
creation
and
no
poor
animal
was
ever
attempted
to
be
tortured
near
him
the
old
looked
on
him
for
comfort
the
young
for
protection
from
infancy
to
manhood
he
has
been
a
benefactor
and
though
the
cruelty
of
our
enemies
have
widowed
his
youthful
years
though
he
should
go
childless
to
the
grave
the
brightness
of
his
virtues
will
now
spread
more
glories
around
the
name
of
wallace
than
a
thousand
posterities
other
ears
than
those
of
dandaff
heard
this
honest
exultation
the
next
morning
this
venerable
old
man
and
other
chiefs
of
similar
consequence
were
summoned
by
sir
richard
arnuf
the
governor
to
his
palace
there
to
deliver
in
a
schedule
of
their
estates
that
quiet
possession
the
governor
said
might
be
granted
to
them
under
the
great
seal
of
lord
aymer
de
valence
the
of
scotland
the
knight
not
being
so
active
as
his
compeers
of
more
juvenile
years
happened
to
be
the
last
who
went
to
this
tiger
den
wrapped
in
his
plaid
his
silver
hair
covered
with
a
blue
bonnet
and
leaning
on
his
staff
he
was
walking
along
attended
by
two
domestics
when
sir
john
graham
met
him
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
he
smiled
on
him
as
he
passed
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
my
wallace
makes
even
the
forms
of
vassalage
unnecessary
and
then
these
failing
limbs
may
sit
undisturbed
at
home
under
the
and
vine
of
his
planting
god
grant
it
returned
graham
and
he
saw
sir
ronald
admitted
within
the
interior
gate
the
servants
were
ordered
to
remain
without
sir
john
walked
there
some
time
expecting
the
reappearance
of
the
knight
whom
he
intended
to
assist
in
leading
home
but
after
an
hour
finding
no
signs
of
egress
from
the
palace
and
thinking
his
father
might
be
wondering
at
his
delay
he
turned
his
steps
toward
his
own
lodgings
while
passing
along
he
met
several
southron
detachments
hurrying
across
the
streets
in
the
midst
of
some
of
these
companies
he
saw
one
or
two
scottish
men
of
rank
strangers
to
him
but
who
by
certain
indications
seemed
to
be
prisoners
he
did
not
go
far
before
he
met
a
chieftain
in
these
painful
circumstances
whom
he
knew
but
as
he
was
hastening
toward
him
the
noble
scot
raised
his
manacled
hand
and
turned
away
his
head
this
was
a
warning
to
the
young
knight
who
darted
into
an
obscure
alley
which
led
to
the
gardens
of
his
lodgings
and
was
hurrying
forward
when
he
met
one
of
his
own
servants
running
in
quest
of
him
panting
with
haste
he
informed
his
master
that
a
party
of
armed
men
had
come
under
de
valence
warrant
to
seize
lord
dundaff
and
bear
him
to
prison
to
lie
there
with
others
who
were
charged
with
having
taken
part
in
a
conspiracy
with
the
grandfather
of
the
insurgent
wallace
the
officer
of
the
band
who
took
lord
dundaff
told
him
in
the
most
insulting
language
that
sir
ronald
his
ringleader
with
eighteen
nobles
his
accomplices
had
already
suffered
the
punishment
of
their
crime
and
were
lying
headless
trunks
in
the
judgment
hall
haste
therefore
repeated
the
man
my
lord
bids
you
haste
to
sir
william
wallace
and
require
his
hand
to
avenge
his
kinsman
blood
and
to
free
his
countrymen
from
prison
these
are
your
commands
he
directed
me
to
seek
you
and
give
them
to
you
alarmed
for
the
life
of
his
father
graham
hesitated
how
to
act
on
the
moment
to
leave
him
seemed
to
abandon
him
to
the
death
the
others
had
received
and
yet
only
by
obeying
him
could
he
have
any
hopes
of
averting
his
threatened
fate
once
seeing
the
path
he
ought
to
pursue
he
struck
immediately
into
it
and
giving
his
signet
to
the
servant
to
assure
lord
dundaff
of
his
obedience
he
mounted
a
horse
which
had
been
brought
to
the
town
end
for
that
purpose
and
setting
off
full
speed
allowed
nothing
to
stay
him
till
he
reached
dumbarton
castle
there
hearing
that
wallace
had
gone
to
bute
he
threw
himself
into
a
boat
and
plying
every
oar
reached
that
island
in
a
shorter
space
of
time
than
the
voyage
had
ever
before
been
completed
being
now
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
chief
he
narrated
his
dismal
tale
with
a
simplicity
and
pathos
which
would
have
instantly
drawn
the
retributive
sword
of
wallace
had
he
had
no
kinsman
to
avenge
no
friend
to
release
from
the
southron
dungeons
but
as
the
case
stood
his
bleeding
grandfather
lay
before
his
eyes
and
the
ax
hung
over
the
heads
of
the
most
virtuous
nobles
of
his
country
he
heard
the
chieftain
to
an
end
without
speaking
or
altering
the
stern
attention
of
his
countenance
but
at
the
close
with
an
augmented
suffusion
of
blood
in
his
face
and
his
brows
denouncing
some
tremendous
fate
he
rose
sir
john
graham
said
he
i
attend
you
whither
demanded
murray
to
ayr
answered
wallace
this
moment
i
will
set
out
for
dumbarton
to
bring
away
the
sinews
of
my
strength
god
will
be
our
speed
and
then
this
arm
shall
show
how
i
loved
that
good
old
man
your
men
interrupted
graham
are
already
awaiting
you
on
the
opposite
shore
i
presumed
to
command
for
you
for
on
entering
dumbarton
and
finding
you
were
absent
after
having
briefly
recounted
my
errand
to
lord
lennox
i
dared
to
interpret
your
mind
and
to
order
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
and
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
with
all
your
own
force
to
follow
me
to
the
coast
of
renfrew
thank
you
my
friend
cried
wallace
grasping
his
hand
may
i
ever
have
such
interpreters
i
can
not
stay
to
bid
your
uncle
farewell
said
he
to
lord
andrew
remain
to
tell
him
to
bless
me
with
his
prayers
and
then
dear
murray
follow
me
to
ayr
ignorant
of
what
the
stranger
had
imparted
at
the
sight
of
the
chiefs
approaching
from
the
castle
gate
edward
hastened
with
the
news
that
all
was
ready
for
embarkation
he
was
hurrying
out
his
information
when
the
altered
countenance
of
his
general
checked
him
he
looked
at
the
stranger
his
features
were
agitated
and
severe
he
turned
toward
his
cousin
all
there
was
grave
and
distressed
again
he
glanced
at
wallace
no
word
was
spoken
but
every
look
threatened
and
edwin
saw
him
leap
into
the
boat
followed
by
the
stranger
the
astonished
boy
though
unnoticed
would
not
be
left
behind
and
stepping
in
also
sat
down
beside
his
chief
i
shall
follow
you
in
a
hour
exclaimed
murray
the
seamen
pushed
off
then
giving
loose
to
their
swelling
sail
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
light
vessel
was
wafted
out
of
the
little
harbor
and
turning
a
point
those
in
the
castle
saw
it
no
more
chapter
xxix
the
barns
of
ayr
while
the
little
bark
bounded
over
the
waves
toward
the
main
land
the
poor
pilgrims
of
earth
who
were
its
freightage
with
heavy
hearts
bent
toward
each
other
intent
on
the
further
information
they
were
to
receive
here
is
a
list
of
the
murdered
chiefs
and
of
those
who
are
in
the
dungeons
expecting
the
like
treatment
continued
graham
holding
out
a
parchment
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
faithful
servant
wallace
took
it
but
seeing
his
grandfather
name
at
the
top
he
could
look
no
further
closing
the
scroll
gallant
graham
said
he
i
want
no
stimulus
to
urge
me
to
the
extirpation
i
meditate
if
the
sword
of
heaven
be
with
us
not
one
perpetrator
of
this
horrid
massacre
shall
be
alive
to
repeat
the
deed
what
massacre
edwin
ventured
to
inquire
wallace
put
the
parchment
into
his
hand
a
list
of
the
scottish
chiefs
murdered
on
the
of
june
in
the
judgment
hall
of
the
english
barons
at
ayr
his
cheek
paled
by
the
suspense
of
his
mind
now
reddened
with
the
hue
of
indignation
but
when
the
venerated
name
of
his
general
grandfather
met
his
sight
his
horror
struck
eye
sought
the
face
of
wallace
it
was
dark
as
before
and
he
was
now
in
earnest
discourse
with
graham
forbearing
to
interrupt
him
edwin
continued
to
read
over
the
names
in
turning
the
page
his
eye
glanced
to
the
opposite
side
and
he
saw
at
the
head
of
a
list
of
prisoners
in
the
dungeons
of
ayr
the
name
of
lord
dundaff
and
immediately
after
it
that
of
lord
ruthven
he
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
extending
his
arms
to
wallace
who
turned
round
at
so
unusual
a
sound
the
boy
exclaimed
my
father
is
in
their
hands
oh
if
you
are
indeed
my
brother
fly
to
ayr
and
save
him
wallace
took
up
the
open
list
which
edwin
had
dropped
he
saw
the
name
of
lord
ruthven
amongst
the
prisoners
and
folding
his
arms
round
this
affectionate
son
compose
yourself
said
he
it
is
to
ayr
i
am
going
and
if
the
god
of
justice
be
our
speed
your
father
and
lord
dundaff
shall
not
see
another
day
in
prison
edwin
threw
himself
on
the
neck
of
his
friend
my
benefactor
was
all
he
could
utter
wallace
pressed
him
silently
to
his
bosom
who
is
this
youth
inquired
graham
to
which
of
the
noble
companions
of
my
captive
father
is
he
son
to
william
ruthven
answered
wallace
the
valiant
lord
of
the
carse
of
gowry
and
it
is
a
noble
scion
from
that
glorious
root
he
it
was
that
enabled
me
to
win
dumbarton
look
up
my
brother
cried
wallace
trying
to
regain
so
tender
a
mind
from
the
paralyzing
terrors
which
had
seized
it
look
up
and
hear
me
recount
the
first
fruits
of
your
maiden
arms
to
our
gallant
friend
covered
with
blushes
arising
from
anxious
emotion
as
well
as
from
a
happy
consciousness
of
having
wont
he
praises
of
his
general
edwin
rose
from
his
breast
and
bowing
to
sir
john
still
leaned
his
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
wallace
that
amiable
being
who
when
seeking
to
wipe
the
tear
of
affliction
from
the
cheek
of
others
minded
not
the
drops
of
blood
which
were
distilling
in
secret
from
his
own
heart
began
the
recital
of
his
first
acquaintance
with
his
young
sir
edwin
he
enumerated
every
particular
his
bringing
the
detachment
from
bothwell
through
the
mountains
to
glenfinlass
his
scaling
the
walls
of
dumbarton
to
make
the
way
smooth
for
the
scots
to
ascend
and
his
after
prowess
in
that
fortress
as
wallace
proceeded
the
wonder
of
graham
was
raised
to
a
pitch
only
to
be
equaled
by
his
admiration
and
taking
the
hand
of
edwin
receive
me
brave
youth
said
he
as
your
second
brother
sir
william
wallace
is
your
first
but
this
night
we
shall
fight
side
by
side
for
our
fathers
and
let
that
be
our
bond
of
kindred
edwin
pressed
the
young
chief
cheek
with
his
innocent
lips
let
us
together
free
them
cried
he
and
then
we
shall
be
born
twins
in
happiness
so
be
it
cried
graham
and
sir
william
wallace
be
the
sponser
of
that
hour
wallace
smiled
on
them
and
turning
his
head
toward
the
shore
when
the
vessel
doubled
a
certain
point
he
saw
the
beach
covered
with
armed
men
to
be
sure
they
were
his
own
he
drew
his
sword
and
waved
it
in
the
air
at
that
moment
a
hundred
falchions
flashed
in
the
sunbeams
and
the
shouts
of
wallace
came
loudly
on
the
breeze
graham
and
edwin
started
on
their
feet
the
seamen
piled
their
oars
the
boat
dashed
into
the
breakers
and
wallace
leaping
on
shore
was
received
with
acclamations
by
his
eager
soldiers
he
no
sooner
landed
than
he
commenced
his
march
murray
joined
him
on
the
banks
of
the
irwin
and
as
ayr
was
no
very
great
distance
from
that
river
at
two
hours
before
midnight
the
little
army
entered
laglane
wood
where
they
halted
while
wallace
with
his
chieftains
proceeded
to
reconnoiter
the
town
the
wind
swept
in
gusts
through
the
trees
and
seemed
by
its
dismal
yellings
to
utter
warnings
of
the
dreadful
retributions
he
was
about
to
inflict
he
had
already
declared
his
plan
of
destruction
and
graham
as
a
first
measure
went
to
the
spot
he
had
fixed
on
with
macdougal
his
servant
as
a
place
of
rendezvous
he
returned
with
the
man
who
informed
wallace
that
in
honor
of
the
sequestrated
lands
of
the
murdered
chiefs
having
been
that
day
partitioned
by
de
valance
amongst
certain
southron
lords
a
grand
feast
was
going
on
in
the
governor
palace
under
the
very
roof
where
they
had
shed
the
blood
of
the
trusting
scots
they
were
now
keeping
this
carousal
now
then
is
our
time
to
strike
cried
wallace
and
ordering
detachments
of
his
men
to
take
possession
of
the
avenues
to
the
town
he
set
forth
with
others
to
reach
the
front
of
the
castle
gates
by
a
less
frequented
path
than
the
main
street
the
darkness
being
so
great
that
no
object
could
be
distinctly
seen
they
had
not
gone
far
before
macdougal
who
had
undertaken
to
be
their
guide
discovered
by
the
projection
of
a
hill
on
the
right
that
he
had
lost
the
road
our
swords
will
find
one
exclaimed
kirkpatrick
unwilling
to
miss
any
advantage
in
a
situation
where
so
much
was
at
stake
wallace
gladly
hailed
a
twinkling
light
which
gleamed
from
what
he
supposed
the
window
of
a
distant
cottage
kirkpatrick
with
macdougal
offered
to
go
forward
and
explore
what
it
might
be
in
a
few
minutes
they
arrived
at
a
thatched
building
from
which
to
their
surprise
issued
the
wailing
strains
of
the
coronach
kirkpatrick
paused
its
melancholy
notes
were
sung
by
female
voices
hence
there
being
no
danger
in
applying
to
such
harmless
inhabitants
to
learn
the
way
to
the
citadel
he
proceeded
to
the
door
when
intending
to
knock
the
weight
of
his
mailed
arm
burst
open
its
slender
latch
and
discovered
two
poor
women
in
an
inner
apartment
wringing
their
hands
over
a
shrouded
corpse
while
the
chief
entered
his
friends
came
up
murray
and
graham
struck
with
sounds
never
breathed
over
the
vulgar
dead
lingered
at
the
porch
wondering
what
noble
scot
could
be
the
subject
of
lamentation
in
so
lowly
an
abode
the
stopping
of
these
two
chieftains
impeded
the
steps
of
wallace
who
was
pressing
forward
without
eye
or
ear
for
anything
but
the
object
of
his
search
kirkpatrick
at
that
moment
appeared
on
the
threshold
and
without
a
word
putting
forth
his
hand
seized
the
arm
of
his
commander
and
pulled
him
into
the
cottage
before
wallace
could
ask
the
reason
of
this
he
saw
a
woman
run
forward
with
a
light
in
her
hand
the
beams
of
which
falling
on
the
face
of
the
knight
of
ellerslie
with
a
shriek
of
joy
she
rushed
toward
him
and
threw
herself
upon
his
neck
he
instantly
recognized
elspa
his
nurse
the
faithful
attendant
on
his
grandfather
declining
years
the
happy
matron
who
had
decked
the
bridal
bed
of
his
marion
and
with
an
anguish
of
recollections
that
almost
unmanned
him
he
returned
her
affectionate
embrace
here
he
lies
cried
the
old
woman
drawing
him
toward
the
rushy
bier
and
before
he
had
time
to
demand
who
she
pulled
down
the
shroud
and
disclosed
the
body
of
sir
ronald
crawford
wallace
gazed
on
it
with
a
look
of
such
dreadful
import
that
edwin
whose
anxious
eyes
then
sought
his
countenance
trembled
with
a
nameless
horror
oh
thought
he
to
what
is
this
noble
soul
reserved
is
he
alone
doomed
to
extirpate
the
enemies
of
scotland
that
every
ill
falls
direct
upon
his
head
sorry
sorry
bier
for
the
good
lord
ronald
cried
the
old
woman
a
poor
wake
to
mourn
the
loss
of
him
who
was
the
benefactor
of
all
the
country
round
but
had
i
not
brought
him
here
the
salt
sea
must
have
been
his
grave
here
sobs
prevented
her
utterance
but
after
a
short
pause
with
many
vehement
lamentations
over
the
virtues
of
the
dead
and
imprecations
on
his
murderers
she
related
that
as
soon
as
the
woful
tidings
were
brought
to
monktown
kirk
and
brought
too
by
the
southron
who
was
to
take
it
in
possession
she
and
the
who
would
not
swear
fidelity
to
the
new
lord
were
driven
from
the
house
she
hastened
to
the
bloody
theater
of
massacre
and
there
beheld
the
bodies
of
the
murdered
chiefs
drawn
on
sledges
to
the
seashore
elspa
knew
that
of
her
master
by
the
scar
on
his
breast
which
he
had
received
in
the
battle
of
largs
when
she
saw
corpse
after
corpse
thrown
with
a
careless
hand
into
the
waves
and
the
man
approached
who
was
to
cast
the
honored
chief
of
monktown
to
the
same
unhallowed
burial
she
threw
herself
frantically
on
the
body
and
so
moved
the
man
compassion
that
taking
advantage
of
the
time
when
his
comrades
were
out
of
sight
he
permitted
her
to
wrap
the
dead
sir
ronald
in
her
plaid
and
so
carry
him
away
between
her
sister
and
herself
but
ere
she
had
raised
her
sacred
burden
the
man
directed
her
to
seek
the
venerable
head
from
amongst
the
others
which
lay
mingled
in
a
sack
drawing
it
forth
she
placed
it
beside
the
body
and
then
hastily
retired
with
both
to
the
hovel
where
wallace
had
found
her
it
was
a
shepherd
hut
from
which
the
desolation
of
the
times
having
long
ago
driven
away
its
former
inhabitant
she
had
hoped
that
in
so
lonely
an
obscurity
she
might
have
performed
without
notice
a
chieftain
rites
to
the
remains
of
the
murdered
lord
of
the
very
lands
on
which
she
wept
him
these
over
she
meant
he
should
be
interred
in
secret
by
the
fathers
of
a
neighboring
church
which
he
had
once
richly
endowed
with
these
intentions
she
and
her
sister
were
chanting
over
him
the
sad
dirge
of
their
country
when
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
burst
open
the
door
ah
cried
she
as
she
closed
the
dismal
narrative
though
two
lonely
women
were
all
they
had
left
of
the
lately
thronged
household
of
sir
ronald
crawford
to
raise
the
last
lament
over
his
revered
body
yet
in
that
and
midnight
hour
our
earthly
voices
were
not
alone
the
wakeful
spirits
of
his
daughters
hovered
in
the
air
and
joined
the
deep
coronach
wallace
sighed
heavily
as
he
looked
on
the
animated
face
of
the
aged
mourner
attachment
to
the
venerable
dead
seemed
to
have
inspired
her
with
thoughts
beyond
her
station
but
the
heart
is
an
able
teacher
and
he
saw
that
true
affection
speaks
but
one
language
as
her
ardent
eyes
withdrew
from
their
heavenward
gaze
they
fell
upon
the
shrouded
face
of
her
master
a
napkin
concealed
the
wound
of
decapitation
chiefs
cried
she
in
a
burst
of
recollection
ye
have
not
seen
all
the
cruelty
of
these
murderers
at
these
words
she
suddenly
withdrew
the
linen
and
lifting
up
the
pale
head
held
it
wofully
toward
wallace
here
cried
she
once
more
kiss
these
lips
they
have
often
kissed
yours
when
you
were
a
babe
and
as
insensible
to
his
love
as
he
is
now
to
your
sorrow
wallace
received
the
head
in
his
arms
the
long
silver
beard
thick
with
gouts
of
blood
hung
over
his
hands
he
gazed
on
it
intently
for
some
minutes
an
awful
silence
pervaded
the
room
every
eye
was
riveted
upon
him
looking
round
on
his
friends
with
a
countenance
whose
deadly
hue
gave
a
sepulchral
fire
to
the
gloomy
denunciation
of
his
eyes
was
it
necessary
said
he
to
turn
my
heart
to
iron
that
i
was
brought
to
see
this
sight
all
the
tremendous
purpose
of
his
soul
was
read
in
his
face
while
he
laid
the
head
back
upon
the
bier
his
lips
again
moved
but
none
heard
what
he
said
he
rushed
from
the
hut
and
with
rapid
strides
proceeded
in
profound
silence
toward
the
palace
he
well
knew
that
no
honest
scot
could
be
under
that
roof
the
building
though
magnificent
was
altogether
a
structure
of
wood
to
fire
it
then
was
his
determination
to
destroy
all
at
once
in
the
theater
of
their
cruelty
to
make
an
execution
not
engage
in
a
warfare
of
man
to
man
was
his
resolution
for
they
were
not
soldiers
hew
as
seeking
but
assassins
and
to
pitch
his
brave
scots
in
the
open
field
against
such
unmanly
wretches
would
be
to
dishonor
his
men
to
give
criminals
a
chance
for
the
lives
they
had
forfeited
all
being
quiet
in
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
and
having
set
strong
bodies
of
men
at
the
mouth
of
every
sallyport
of
the
citadel
he
made
a
bold
attack
upon
the
guard
at
the
and
ere
they
could
give
the
alarm
all
being
slain
he
and
his
chosen
troop
entered
the
portal
and
made
direct
to
the
palace
the
lights
which
blazed
through
the
windows
of
the
banqueting
hall
showed
him
to
the
spot
and
having
detached
graham
and
edwin
to
storm
the
keep
where
their
fathers
were
confined
he
took
the
sentinels
at
the
by
surprise
and
striking
them
into
a
sleep
from
which
they
would
wake
no
more
he
fastened
the
doors
upon
the
assassins
his
men
surrounded
the
building
with
hurdles
filled
with
combustibles
which
they
had
prepared
according
to
his
directions
and
when
all
was
ready
wallace
with
the
mighty
spirit
of
retribution
nerving
every
limb
mounted
to
the
roof
and
tearing
off
the
shingles
with
a
flaming
brand
in
his
hand
showed
himself
to
the
affrighted
revelers
beneath
and
as
he
threw
it
blazing
among
them
he
cried
aloud
the
blood
of
the
murdered
calls
for
vengeance
and
it
comes
at
that
instant
the
matches
were
put
to
the
fagots
which
surrounded
the
building
and
the
party
within
springing
from
their
seats
hastened
toward
the
doors
all
were
fastened
on
them
and
retreating
into
the
midst
of
the
room
they
fearfully
looked
toward
the
tremendous
figure
above
which
like
a
supernatural
being
seemed
indeed
come
to
rain
fire
upon
their
guilty
heads
some
shook
with
superstitious
dread
others
driven
to
atheistical
despair
with
horrible
execrations
again
strove
to
force
a
passage
through
the
doors
a
second
glance
told
de
valence
whose
was
the
hand
which
had
launched
the
thunderbolt
at
his
feet
and
turning
to
sir
richard
arnuf
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
horror
my
is
there
thick
smoke
rising
from
within
and
without
the
building
now
obscured
his
terrific
form
the
shouts
of
the
scots
as
the
fire
covered
its
walls
and
the
streaming
flames
licking
the
windows
and
pouring
into
every
opening
of
the
building
raised
such
a
terror
in
the
breasts
of
the
wretches
within
that
with
the
most
horrible
cries
they
again
and
again
flew
to
the
doors
to
escape
not
an
avenue
appeared
almost
suffocated
with
smoke
and
scorched
by
the
blazing
rafters
which
fell
from
the
burning
roof
they
at
last
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
break
a
passage
through
the
great
portal
arnuf
was
at
their
head
and
sunk
to
abjectness
by
his
despair
in
a
voice
which
terror
rendered
piercing
he
called
aloud
for
mercy
the
words
reached
the
ear
of
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
who
stood
neared
to
the
door
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
replied
that
ye
gave
ye
shall
receive
where
was
mercy
when
our
fathers
and
our
brothers
fell
beneath
your
murderous
axes
aymer
de
valence
came
up
at
this
moment
with
a
wooden
pillar
which
he
and
his
strongest
men
in
the
company
had
torn
from
under
the
gallery
that
surrounded
the
room
and
with
all
their
strength
dashing
it
against
the
great
door
they
at
last
drove
it
from
its
bolts
but
now
a
wall
of
men
opposed
them
desperate
at
the
sight
and
with
a
burning
furnace
in
their
rear
it
was
not
the
might
of
man
that
could
prevent
their
escape
and
with
the
determination
of
despair
rushing
forward
the
foremost
rank
of
scots
fell
but
ere
the
exulting
southrons
could
press
out
into
the
open
space
wallace
himself
had
closed
upon
them
and
arnuf
the
merciless
arnuf
whose
voice
had
pronounced
the
sentence
of
death
upon
sir
ronald
crawford
died
beneath
his
hand
wallace
was
not
aware
that
he
had
killed
the
governor
of
ayr
till
the
exclamations
of
his
enemies
informed
him
that
the
ruthless
instigator
of
the
massacre
was
slain
this
event
was
welcome
news
to
the
scots
and
hoping
that
the
next
death
would
be
that
of
de
valence
they
pressed
on
with
redoubled
energy
aroused
by
so
extraordinary
a
noise
and
alarmed
by
the
flames
of
the
palace
the
soldiers
quartered
near
hastened
half
armed
to
the
spot
but
their
presence
rather
added
to
the
confusion
than
gave
assistance
to
the
besieged
they
were
without
leaders
and
not
daring
to
put
themselves
to
action
for
fear
of
being
afterward
punished
in
the
case
of
a
mischance
for
having
presumed
to
move
without
their
officers
they
stood
dismayed
and
irresolute
while
those
very
officers
who
had
been
all
at
the
banquet
were
falling
in
heaps
under
the
swords
of
the
exterminating
scots
meanwhile
the
men
who
guarded
the
prisoners
in
the
keep
having
their
commanders
with
them
made
a
stout
resistance
there
and
one
of
the
officers
seeing
a
possible
advantage
stole
out
and
gathering
a
company
of
the
scattered
garrison
suddenly
taking
graham
in
flank
made
no
inconsiderable
havoc
amongst
that
part
of
his
division
edwin
blew
the
signal
for
assistance
wallace
heard
the
blast
and
seeing
the
day
was
won
at
the
palace
he
left
the
finishing
of
the
affair
to
kirkpatrick
and
murray
and
drawing
off
a
small
party
to
reinforce
graham
he
took
the
southron
officer
by
surprise
the
enemy
ranks
fell
around
him
like
corn
beneath
the
sickle
and
grasping
a
huge
battering
ram
which
his
men
had
found
he
burst
open
the
door
of
the
keep
graham
and
edwin
rushed
in
and
wallace
sounding
his
own
bugle
with
the
notes
of
victory
his
reserves
whom
he
had
placed
at
the
ends
of
the
streets
entered
in
every
direction
and
received
the
flying
soldiers
of
de
valence
upon
their
pikes
dreadful
was
now
the
carnage
for
the
southrons
forgetting
all
discipline
fought
every
man
for
his
life
which
the
furious
scots
driving
them
into
the
flames
what
escaped
the
sword
would
have
perished
in
the
fire
had
not
the
relenting
heart
of
wallace
pleaded
for
bleeding
humanity
and
he
ordered
the
trumpet
to
sound
a
parley
he
was
obeyed
and
standing
on
an
adjacent
mound
in
an
awful
voice
he
proclaimed
that
whoever
had
not
been
accomplices
in
the
horrible
massacre
of
the
scottish
chiefs
if
they
would
ground
their
arms
and
take
an
oath
never
to
serve
again
against
scotland
their
lives
should
be
spared
hundreds
of
swords
fell
to
the
ground
and
their
late
holders
kneeling
at
his
feet
took
the
oath
perscribed
at
the
head
of
those
who
surrendered
appeared
the
captain
who
had
commanded
at
the
prison
he
was
the
only
officer
of
all
the
late
garrison
who
survived
all
else
had
fallen
in
the
conflict
or
perished
in
the
flames
and
when
he
saw
that
not
one
of
his
late
numerous
companions
existed
to
go
through
the
same
humiliating
ceremony
with
an
aghast
countenance
he
said
to
wallace
as
he
presented
his
sword
then
i
must
believe
that
with
this
weapon
i
am
surrendering
to
sir
william
wallace
the
possession
of
this
castle
and
the
government
of
ayr
i
see
not
one
of
my
late
commanders
all
must
be
slain
and
for
me
to
hold
out
longer
would
be
to
sacrifice
my
men
not
to
redeem
that
which
has
been
so
completely
wrested
from
us
but
i
serve
severe
exactors
and
i
hope
that
your
testimony
my
conqueror
will
assure
my
king
that
i
fought
as
became
his
standard
wallace
gave
him
a
gracious
answer
and
committing
him
to
the
generous
care
of
murray
he
turned
to
give
orders
to
ker
respecting
the
surrendered
and
the
slain
during
these
momentous
events
graham
had
deemed
it
prudent
that
exhausted
by
anxiety
and
privations
the
noble
captives
should
not
come
forth
to
join
in
the
battle
and
not
until
the
sound
of
victory
echoed
through
the
arches
of
their
dungeons
would
he
suffer
the
eager
dundaff
to
see
and
thank
his
deliverer
meanwhile
the
young
edwin
appeared
before
the
eyes
of
his
father
like
the
angel
who
opened
the
prison
gates
to
peter
after
embracing
him
with
all
a
son
fondness
in
which
for
the
moment
he
lost
the
repressing
idea
that
he
might
have
offended
by
his
truancy
after
recounting
in
a
few
hasty
sentences
the
events
which
had
brought
him
to
be
a
companion
of
sir
william
wallace
and
to
avenge
the
injuries
of
scotland
in
ayr
he
knocked
off
the
chains
of
his
amazed
father
eager
to
perform
the
like
service
to
all
who
had
suffered
in
like
manner
and
accompanied
by
the
happy
lord
ruthven
who
gazed
with
delight
on
his
son
treading
so
early
the
path
of
glory
he
hastened
around
to
the
other
dungeons
and
gladly
proclaimed
to
the
astonished
inmates
freedom
and
safety
having
rid
them
of
their
shackles
he
had
just
entered
with
his
noble
company
into
the
vaulted
chamber
which
contained
the
released
lord
dundaff
when
the
peaceful
clarion
sounded
at
the
joyful
tidings
graham
started
on
his
feet
now
my
father
you
shall
see
the
bravest
of
men
chapter
xxx
the
barns
of
ayr
morning
was
spreading
in
pale
light
over
the
heavens
and
condensing
with
its
cold
breath
the
lurid
smoke
which
still
ascended
in
volumes
from
the
burning
ruins
when
wallace
turning
round
at
the
glad
voice
of
edwin
beheld
the
released
nobles
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
the
lords
dundaff
and
ruthven
but
several
of
the
others
he
remembered
having
met
at
the
fatal
decision
of
the
crown
and
while
welcoming
to
his
friendship
those
to
whom
his
valor
had
given
freedom
how
great
was
his
surprise
to
see
in
the
person
of
a
prisoner
suddenly
brought
before
him
sir
john
monteith
the
young
chieftain
whom
he
had
parted
with
a
few
months
ago
at
douglas
and
from
whose
fatal
invitation
to
that
castle
he
might
date
the
ruin
of
his
dearest
happiness
and
all
the
succeeding
catastrophe
we
found
sir
john
monteith
amongst
the
slain
before
the
palace
said
ker
he
of
the
whole
party
alone
breathed
i
knew
him
instantly
how
he
came
there
i
know
not
but
i
have
brought
him
hither
to
explain
it
himself
ker
withdrew
to
finish
the
interment
of
the
dead
monteith
still
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
soldier
grasped
hand
my
brave
friend
cried
he
to
owe
my
liberty
to
you
is
a
twofold
pleasure
for
added
he
in
a
lowered
voice
i
see
before
me
the
man
who
is
to
verify
the
words
of
baliol
and
be
not
only
the
guardian
but
the
possessor
of
the
treasure
he
committed
to
our
care
wallace
who
had
never
thought
on
the
coffer
since
he
knew
it
was
under
the
protection
of
fillan
shook
his
head
a
far
different
need
do
i
seek
my
friend
said
he
to
behold
these
happy
countenances
of
my
liberated
countrymen
is
greater
reward
to
me
than
would
be
the
development
of
all
the
splendid
mysteries
which
the
head
of
baliol
could
devise
ay
cried
dundaff
who
overheard
this
part
of
the
conversation
we
invited
the
usurpation
of
a
tyrant
by
the
docility
with
which
we
submitted
to
his
minion
had
we
rejected
baliol
we
had
never
been
ridden
by
edward
but
the
rowel
has
gored
the
flanks
of
us
all
and
who
amongst
us
will
not
lay
himself
and
fortune
at
the
foot
of
him
who
plucks
away
the
tyrant
heel
it
all
held
our
cause
in
the
light
that
you
do
returned
wallace
the
blood
which
these
southrons
have
sown
would
rise
up
in
ten
thousand
legions
to
overwhelm
the
murderers
but
how
inquired
he
turning
to
monteith
did
you
happen
to
be
in
ayr
at
this
period
and
how
above
all
amongst
the
slaughtered
southrons
at
the
palace
sir
john
monteith
readily
replied
my
adverse
fate
accounts
for
all
he
then
proceeded
to
inform
wallace
that
on
the
very
night
in
which
they
parted
at
douglas
sir
arthur
heselrigge
was
told
the
story
of
the
box
and
accordingly
sent
to
have
monteith
brought
prisoner
to
lanark
he
lay
in
the
dungeons
of
its
citadel
at
the
very
time
wallace
entered
that
town
and
destroyed
the
governor
though
the
scots
did
not
pursue
the
advantage
offered
by
the
transient
panic
into
which
the
retribution
threw
their
enemies
care
was
immediately
taken
by
the
english
lieutenant
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
same
disasters
and
in
consequence
every
suspected
person
was
seized
and
those
already
in
confinement
loaded
with
chains
monteith
being
known
as
a
friend
of
wallace
was
sent
under
a
strong
guard
toward
stirling
there
to
stand
his
trial
before
cressingham
and
the
english
justiciary
ormsby
by
a
lucky
chance
said
he
i
made
my
escape
but
i
was
soon
retaken
by
another
party
and
conveyed
to
ayr
where
the
arnuf
discovering
my
talents
for
music
compelled
me
to
sing
at
his
entertainments
for
this
purpose
he
last
night
confined
me
in
the
at
the
palace
and
thus
when
the
flames
surrounded
that
building
i
found
myself
exposed
to
die
the
death
of
a
traitor
though
then
as
much
oppressed
as
any
other
scot
snatching
up
a
sword
and
striving
to
join
my
brave
countrymen
the
southrons
impeded
my
passage
and
i
fell
under
their
arms
happy
to
have
rescued
his
old
acquaintance
from
further
indignities
wallace
committed
him
to
edwin
to
lead
into
the
citadel
then
taking
the
colors
of
edward
from
the
ground
where
the
southron
officer
had
laid
them
he
gave
them
to
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
with
orders
to
fill
their
former
station
on
the
citadel
with
the
standard
of
scotland
this
action
he
considered
as
the
seal
of
each
victory
as
the
beacon
which
seen
from
afar
would
show
the
desolate
scots
where
to
find
a
protector
and
from
what
ground
to
start
when
courage
should
prompt
them
to
assert
their
rights
the
standard
was
no
sooner
raised
than
the
proud
clarion
of
triumph
was
blown
from
every
warlike
instrument
in
the
garrison
and
the
southron
captain
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
disarmed
troops
under
the
escort
of
murray
marched
out
of
the
castle
he
announced
his
design
to
proceed
immediately
to
newcastle
and
thence
embark
with
his
men
to
join
their
king
at
flanders
not
more
than
two
hundred
followed
their
officer
in
this
expedition
for
not
more
were
english
the
rest
to
nearly
double
that
number
being
like
the
garrison
of
dumbarton
irish
and
welsh
were
glad
to
escape
enforced
servitude
some
parted
off
in
divisions
to
return
to
their
respective
countries
while
a
few
whose
energetic
spirits
preferred
a
life
of
warfare
in
the
cause
of
a
country
struggling
for
freedom
before
returning
to
submit
to
the
oppressors
of
their
own
enlisted
under
the
banners
of
wallace
some
other
necessary
regulations
being
then
made
he
dismissed
his
gallant
scots
to
find
refreshment
in
the
barracks
of
the
dispersed
southrons
and
retired
himself
to
join
his
friends
in
the
citadel
chapter
xxxi
berwick
and
the
tweed
in
the
course
of
an
hour
murray
returned
from
having
seen
the
departing
southrons
beyond
the
barriers
of
the
township
but
he
did
not
come
alone
he
was
accompanied
by
lord
auchinleck
the
son
of
one
of
the
betrayed
barons
who
had
fallen
in
the
palace
of
ayr
this
young
chieftain
at
the
head
of
his
vassals
hastened
to
support
the
man
whose
dauntless
hand
had
thus
satisfied
his
revenge
and
when
he
met
murray
at
the
north
gate
of
the
town
and
recognized
in
his
flying
banners
a
friend
of
scotland
he
was
happy
to
make
himself
known
to
an
officer
of
wallace
and
to
be
conducted
to
that
chief
while
lord
andrew
and
his
new
colleague
were
making
the
range
of
the
suburbs
the
glad
progress
of
the
victor
scots
had
turned
the
whole
aspect
of
that
gloomy
city
doors
and
windows
so
recently
closed
in
deep
mourning
for
the
sanguinary
deeds
done
in
the
palace
now
opened
teeming
with
smiling
inhabitants
the
general
joy
penetrated
to
the
most
remote
recesses
mothers
now
threw
their
fond
arms
around
the
necks
of
the
children
whom
just
before
they
had
regarded
with
the
averted
eyes
of
despair
in
the
one
sex
they
then
beheld
the
victims
of
perhaps
the
next
requisition
for
blood
and
in
the
other
the
hapless
prey
of
passions
more
felt
than
the
horrid
rage
of
the
beast
of
the
field
but
now
all
was
secure
again
these
terrific
tyrants
were
driven
hence
and
the
happy
parent
embracing
her
offspring
as
if
restored
from
the
grave
implored
a
thousand
blessings
on
the
head
of
wallace
the
gifted
agent
of
all
this
good
sons
who
in
secret
had
lamented
the
treacherous
death
of
their
fathers
and
brothers
of
their
brothers
now
opened
their
gates
and
joined
the
valiant
troops
in
the
streets
widowed
wives
and
fatherless
daughters
almost
forgot
they
had
been
bereaved
of
their
natural
protectors
when
they
saw
scotland
rescued
from
her
enemies
and
her
armed
sons
once
more
walking
in
the
broad
day
masters
of
themselves
and
of
their
country
liberties
thus
then
with
every
heart
rejoicing
every
house
teeming
with
numbers
to
swell
the
ranks
of
wallace
did
he
the
day
after
he
had
entered
ayr
see
all
arranged
for
its
peaceful
establishment
but
ere
he
bade
that
town
adieu
in
which
he
had
been
educated
and
where
almost
every
man
remembering
its
preserver
boyish
years
thronged
round
him
with
recollections
of
former
days
one
duty
yet
demanded
his
stay
to
pay
funeral
honors
to
the
remains
of
his
beloved
grandfather
accordingly
the
time
was
fixed
and
with
every
solemnity
due
to
his
virtues
and
his
rank
sir
ronald
crawford
was
buried
in
the
chapel
of
the
citadel
it
was
not
a
scene
of
mere
ceremonious
mourning
as
he
had
been
the
father
of
the
fatherless
he
was
followed
to
the
grave
by
many
an
orphan
tears
and
as
he
had
been
the
protector
of
the
distressed
of
every
degree
a
procession
long
and
full
of
lamentation
conducted
his
shrouded
corpse
to
its
earthly
rest
the
mourning
families
of
the
chiefs
who
had
fallen
in
the
same
bloody
theater
with
himself
closed
the
sad
retinue
and
while
the
holy
rites
committed
his
body
to
the
ground
the
sacred
mass
was
extended
to
those
who
had
been
plunged
into
the
weltering
element
while
wallace
confided
the
aged
elspa
and
her
sister
to
the
care
of
sir
reginald
crawford
to
whom
he
also
resigned
the
lands
of
his
grandfather
cousin
said
he
you
are
a
valiant
and
a
humane
man
i
leave
you
to
be
the
representative
of
your
venerable
uncle
to
cherish
these
poor
women
whom
he
loved
to
be
the
protector
of
his
people
and
the
defender
of
the
town
the
citadel
is
under
the
command
of
the
baron
of
auchinleck
he
with
his
brave
followers
being
the
first
to
hail
the
burning
of
the
accursed
barns
of
ayr
after
this
solemnity
and
these
dispositions
wallace
called
a
review
of
his
troops
and
found
that
he
could
leave
five
hundred
men
at
ayr
and
march
an
army
of
at
least
two
thousand
out
of
it
his
present
design
was
to
take
his
course
to
berwick
and
by
seizing
every
castle
of
strength
in
his
way
form
a
chain
of
works
across
the
country
which
would
not
only
bulwark
scotland
against
any
further
inroads
from
its
enemies
but
render
the
subjugation
of
the
interior
southron
garrisons
more
certain
and
easy
on
the
third
morning
after
the
conflagration
of
the
palace
wallace
quitted
ayr
and
marching
over
its
hills
manned
every
on
their
summits
for
now
whithersoever
he
moved
he
found
his
victories
had
preceded
him
and
all
from
hall
to
hovel
turned
out
to
greet
and
offer
him
their
services
thus
heralded
by
fame
the
southron
governors
fled
at
the
distant
view
of
his
standards
the
flames
of
ayr
seemed
to
menace
them
all
and
castle
and
fortalice
from
muirkirk
to
the
walls
of
berwick
opened
their
gates
before
him
arrived
under
those
towers
which
had
so
often
been
the
objects
of
dispute
between
the
powers
of
england
and
of
scotland
he
prepared
for
their
immediate
attack
berwick
being
a
valuable
fortress
to
the
enemy
not
only
as
a
key
to
the
invaded
kingdom
but
a
point
whence
by
their
ships
they
commanded
the
whole
of
the
eastern
coast
of
scotland
wallace
expected
that
a
desperate
stand
would
be
made
here
to
stop
the
progress
of
his
arms
but
being
aware
that
the
most
expeditious
mode
of
warfare
was
the
best
adapted
to
promote
his
cause
he
first
took
the
town
by
assault
and
then
having
driven
the
garrison
into
the
citadel
assailed
it
by
a
vigorous
seige
after
ten
days
hard
duty
before
the
walls
wallace
devised
a
plan
to
obtain
possession
of
the
english
ships
which
commanded
the
harbor
he
found
among
his
own
troops
many
men
who
had
been
used
to
a
seafaring
life
these
he
disguised
as
fugitive
southrons
from
the
late
defeats
and
sent
in
boats
to
the
enemy
vessels
which
lay
in
the
roads
the
feint
took
and
by
these
means
getting
possession
of
those
nearest
the
town
he
manned
them
with
his
own
people
and
going
out
with
them
himself
in
three
days
made
himself
master
of
every
ship
on
the
coast
by
this
maneuver
the
situation
of
the
beseiged
was
rendered
so
hopeless
that
no
mode
of
escape
was
left
but
by
desperate
sallies
they
made
them
but
without
other
effect
than
weakening
their
strength
and
increasing
their
miseries
wallace
was
for
them
to
do
in
their
situation
he
needed
no
better
spy
over
their
actions
than
his
own
judgment
foiled
in
every
attempt
as
their
opponent
guessing
their
intentions
was
prepared
at
every
point
to
meet
their
different
essays
and
losing
men
at
every
rencounter
their
governor
stood
without
resource
without
provisions
without
aid
of
any
kind
for
his
wounded
men
and
hourly
annoyed
by
the
victorious
scots
who
continued
day
and
night
to
throw
showers
of
arrows
and
other
missile
weapons
from
the
towers
and
springalls
with
which
they
had
overtopped
the
walls
the
unhappy
earl
of
gloucester
seemed
ready
to
rush
on
death
to
avoid
the
disgrace
of
surrendering
the
fortress
every
soul
in
the
garrison
was
reduced
to
similar
despair
wallace
even
found
means
to
dam
up
the
spring
which
had
supplied
the
citadel
with
water
the
common
men
famished
with
hunger
smarting
with
wounds
and
now
perishing
with
inextinguishable
thirst
threw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
their
officers
imploring
them
to
represent
to
their
royal
governor
that
if
he
held
out
longer
he
must
defend
the
place
alone
for
they
could
not
exist
another
day
under
their
present
sufferings
the
earl
indeed
repented
the
rashness
with
which
he
had
thrown
himself
unprovisioned
into
the
citadel
he
now
saw
that
expectation
was
no
apology
for
want
of
precaution
when
his
first
division
had
been
overpowered
in
the
assault
on
the
town
his
evil
genius
then
suggested
that
it
was
best
to
take
the
second
unbroken
into
the
citadel
and
there
await
the
arrival
of
a
reinforcement
by
sea
but
he
thence
beheld
the
ships
which
had
defended
the
harbor
seized
by
wallace
before
his
eyes
hope
was
then
crushed
and
nothing
but
death
or
dishonor
seemed
to
be
his
alternatives
cut
to
the
soul
at
the
consequences
of
his
want
of
judgment
he
determined
to
retrieve
his
fame
by
washing
out
that
error
with
his
blood
to
fall
under
the
ruins
of
berwick
castle
was
his
resolution
such
was
the
state
of
his
mind
when
his
officers
appeared
with
the
petition
from
his
men
in
proportion
as
they
felt
the
extremities
into
which
they
were
driven
the
offense
he
had
committed
glared
with
tenfold
enormity
in
his
eyes
and
in
a
wild
despair
he
told
them
they
might
do
as
they
would
but
for
his
part
the
moment
they
opened
the
gates
to
the
enemy
that
moment
should
be
the
last
of
his
life
he
that
was
the
of
king
edward
would
never
yield
his
sword
to
a
scottish
rebel
terrified
at
these
threats
on
himself
the
soldiers
who
loved
their
general
declared
themselves
willing
to
die
with
him
and
as
a
last
effort
proposed
making
a
mine
under
the
principal
tower
of
the
scots
and
by
setting
fire
to
it
at
least
destroy
the
means
by
which
they
feared
their
enemies
might
storm
the
citadel
as
wallace
gave
his
orders
from
this
commanding
station
he
observed
the
besieged
passing
in
numbers
behind
a
mound
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
where
he
stood
he
concluded
what
was
their
design
and
ordering
a
countermine
to
be
made
what
he
anticipated
happened
and
murray
at
the
head
of
his
miners
encountered
those
of
the
castle
at
the
very
moment
they
would
have
set
fire
to
the
combustibles
laid
to
consume
the
tower
the
instant
struggle
was
violent
but
short
for
the
impetuous
scots
drove
their
amazed
and
enfeebled
adversaries
through
the
aperture
back
into
the
citadel
at
this
crisis
wallace
with
a
band
of
resolute
men
sprung
from
the
tower
upon
the
wall
and
it
being
almost
deserted
by
its
late
guards
who
had
quitted
their
post
to
assist
in
repelling
the
foe
below
he
leaped
into
the
midst
of
the
conflict
and
the
battle
became
general
it
was
decisive
for
beholding
the
undaunted
resolution
with
which
the
weakened
and
dying
were
supporting
the
cause
their
governor
was
determined
to
defend
to
the
last
wallace
found
his
admiration
and
his
pity
alike
excited
and
even
while
his
followers
seemed
to
have
each
his
foe
life
in
his
hands
when
one
instant
more
would
make
him
the
undisputed
master
of
the
castle
for
not
a
southron
would
then
breathe
to
dispute
it
he
resolved
to
stop
the
carnage
at
the
moment
when
a
gallant
officer
who
having
assaulted
him
with
the
vehemence
of
despair
now
lay
disarmed
under
him
at
that
moment
when
the
discomfited
knight
exclaimed
in
mercy
strike
and
redeem
the
honor
of
ralph
de
monthermer
wallace
raised
his
bugle
and
sounded
the
note
of
peace
every
sword
was
arrested
and
the
universal
clangor
of
battle
was
hushed
in
expecting
silence
de
monthermer
a
noble
knight
who
married
jane
of
acre
the
daughter
of
king
edward
i
he
was
created
earl
of
gloucester
on
his
marriage
with
that
rise
brave
earl
cried
wallace
to
the
governor
i
revere
virtue
too
sincerely
to
take
an
unworthy
advantage
of
my
fortune
the
valor
of
this
garrison
commands
my
respect
and
as
a
proof
of
my
sincerity
i
grant
to
it
what
i
have
never
yet
done
to
any
that
yourself
and
these
dauntless
men
march
out
with
the
honors
of
war
and
without
any
bonds
on
your
future
conduct
toward
us
we
leave
it
to
your
own
hearts
to
decide
whether
you
will
ever
be
again
made
instruments
to
enchain
a
free
and
brave
people
while
he
was
speaking
de
monthermer
leaned
gloomily
on
the
sword
he
had
returned
to
him
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
men
they
answered
his
glance
with
looks
that
said
they
understood
him
and
passing
a
few
words
in
whispers
to
each
other
one
at
last
spoke
aloud
decide
for
us
earl
we
are
as
ready
to
die
as
to
live
so
that
in
neither
we
may
be
divided
from
you
at
this
generous
declaration
the
proud
despair
of
de
monthermer
gave
way
to
nobler
feelings
and
while
a
big
tear
stood
in
each
eye
he
turned
to
wallace
and
stretching
out
his
hand
to
him
noble
scot
said
he
your
unexampled
generosity
and
the
invincible
fidelity
of
these
heroic
men
have
compelled
me
to
accept
the
life
i
had
resolved
to
lose
under
these
walls
rather
than
resign
them
but
virtue
is
resistless
and
to
it
do
i
surrender
that
pride
of
soul
which
made
existence
insufferable
under
the
consciousness
of
having
erred
when
i
became
the
husband
of
king
edward
daughter
i
believed
myself
pledged
to
victories
or
to
death
but
there
is
a
conquest
and
i
feel
it
greater
than
over
hosts
in
the
field
and
here
taught
to
make
it
the
husband
of
the
princess
of
england
the
proud
earl
of
gloucester
consents
to
live
to
be
a
monument
of
scottish
nobleness
and
of
the
inflexible
fidelity
of
english
soldiers
you
live
illustrious
and
virtuous
englishmen
returned
wallace
to
redeem
that
honor
of
which
too
many
rapacious
sons
of
england
have
robbed
their
country
go
forth
therefore
as
my
conqueror
for
you
have
on
this
spot
extinguished
that
burning
antipathy
with
which
the
outraged
heart
of
william
wallace
had
vowed
to
extirpate
every
southron
from
off
this
ravaged
land
honor
brave
earl
makes
all
men
brethren
and
as
a
brother
i
open
these
gates
for
you
to
repass
into
your
country
when
there
if
you
ever
remember
william
wallace
let
it
be
as
a
man
who
fights
not
for
conquest
or
renown
but
to
restore
scotland
to
her
rights
and
then
resign
his
sword
to
peace
i
shall
remember
you
sir
william
wallace
returned
de
monthermer
and
as
a
pledge
of
it
you
shall
never
see
me
again
in
this
country
till
i
come
an
embassador
of
that
peace
for
which
you
fight
but
meanwhile
in
the
moment
of
hot
contention
for
the
rights
which
you
believe
wrested
from
you
do
you
remember
that
they
have
not
been
so
much
the
spoil
of
my
royal
father
ambition
as
the
traffic
of
your
own
venal
nobles
had
i
not
believed
that
scotland
was
unworthy
of
freedom
i
should
never
have
appeared
upon
her
borders
but
now
that
i
see
that
she
has
brave
hearts
within
her
who
not
only
resist
oppression
but
know
how
to
wield
power
i
detest
the
zeal
with
which
i
volunteered
to
rivet
her
chains
and
i
repeat
that
never
again
shall
my
hostile
foot
impress
this
land
these
sentiments
were
answered
in
the
same
spirit
by
his
soldiers
and
the
scots
following
the
example
of
their
leader
treated
them
with
every
kindness
after
dispensing
amongst
them
provisions
and
appointing
means
to
convey
the
wounded
in
comfort
wallace
bade
a
cordial
farewell
to
the
earl
of
gloucester
and
his
men
conducted
their
reconciled
enemies
over
the
tweed
there
they
parted
the
english
bent
their
course
toward
london
and
the
scots
returned
to
their
victorious
general
chapter
xxxii
stirling
the
happy
effects
of
these
rapid
conquests
were
soon
apparent
the
fall
of
berwick
excited
such
a
confidence
in
the
minds
of
the
neighboring
chieftains
that
every
hour
brought
fresh
recruits
to
wallace
every
mouth
was
full
of
the
praises
of
the
young
conqueror
every
eye
was
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
person
and
while
the
men
were
emulous
to
share
his
glory
the
women
in
their
secret
bowers
put
up
prayers
for
the
preservation
of
one
so
handsome
and
so
brave
amongst
the
many
of
every
rank
and
age
who
hastened
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
deliverer
of
berwick
was
sir
richard
maitland
of
thirlestane
the
stawlart
knight
of
lauderdale
richard
maitland
of
the
castle
of
thirlestane
on
the
leeder
is
noted
in
scottish
tradition
for
his
bravery
his
valiant
defense
of
his
castle
against
the
english
in
his
extreme
old
age
is
still
the
subject
of
enthusiasm
amongst
the
people
of
lauderdale
wallace
was
no
sooner
told
of
the
approach
of
the
venerable
chief
than
he
set
forth
to
bid
him
welcome
at
sight
of
the
champion
of
scotland
sir
richard
threw
himself
off
his
horse
with
a
military
grace
that
might
have
become
even
youthful
years
and
hastening
toward
wallace
clasped
him
in
his
arms
let
me
look
on
thee
cried
the
old
knight
let
me
feast
my
eyes
on
the
true
scot
who
again
raises
this
hoary
head
so
long
bent
in
shame
for
its
dishonored
country
while
he
spoke
he
viewed
wallace
from
head
to
foot
i
knew
sir
ronald
crawford
and
thy
valiant
father
continued
he
o
had
they
lived
to
see
this
day
but
the
base
murder
of
the
one
thou
hast
nobly
avenged
and
the
honorable
grave
of
the
other
on
loudon
hill
thou
wilt
cover
with
a
monument
of
thine
own
glories
low
are
laid
my
own
children
in
this
land
of
strife
but
in
thee
i
see
a
son
of
scotland
that
is
to
dry
all
our
tears
malcolm
wallace
the
father
of
sir
william
wallace
was
killed
in
the
year
on
loudon
hill
in
a
battle
with
the
english
he
embraced
wallace
again
and
again
and
as
the
veteran
overflowing
heart
rendered
him
garrulous
he
expatiated
on
the
energy
with
which
the
young
victor
had
pursued
his
conquests
and
paralleled
them
with
the
brilliant
actions
he
had
seen
in
his
youth
while
he
thus
discoursed
wallace
drew
him
toward
the
castle
and
there
presented
to
him
the
two
nephews
of
the
earl
of
may
he
paid
some
warm
compliments
to
edwin
on
his
early
success
in
the
career
of
glory
and
then
turning
to
murray
ay
said
he
it
is
joy
to
me
to
see
the
valiant
house
of
bothwell
in
the
third
generation
thy
grandfather
and
myself
were
boys
together
at
the
coronation
of
alexander
the
second
and
that
is
eighty
years
ago
since
then
what
have
i
not
seen
the
death
of
two
noble
scottish
kings
our
blooming
princes
ravished
from
us
by
untimely
fates
the
throne
sold
to
a
coward
and
at
last
seized
by
a
foreign
power
then
in
my
own
person
i
have
been
the
father
of
as
brave
and
beauteous
a
family
as
ever
blessed
a
parent
eye
but
they
are
all
torn
from
me
two
of
my
sons
sleep
on
the
plains
of
dunbar
my
third
my
dauntless
william
since
that
fatal
day
has
been
kept
a
prisoner
in
england
and
my
daughters
the
tender
blossoms
of
my
aged
years
they
grew
around
me
the
fairest
lilies
of
the
land
but
they
too
are
passed
away
the
one
scorning
the
mere
charms
of
youth
and
preferring
a
union
with
a
soul
that
had
long
conversed
with
superior
regions
loved
the
sage
of
ercildown
but
my
friend
lost
this
rose
of
his
bosom
and
i
the
child
of
my
heart
ere
she
had
been
a
year
his
wife
then
was
my
last
and
only
daughter
married
to
the
lord
mar
and
in
giving
birth
to
my
dear
isabella
she
too
died
ah
my
good
young
knight
were
it
not
for
that
sweet
child
the
living
image
of
her
mother
who
in
the
very
spring
of
youth
was
cropped
and
fell
i
should
be
alone
my
hoary
head
would
descend
to
the
grave
unwept
unregretted
the
joy
of
the
old
man
having
recalled
such
melancholy
remembrances
he
wept
upon
the
shoulder
of
edwin
who
had
drawn
so
near
that
the
story
was
begun
to
murray
was
ended
to
him
to
give
the
mourning
father
time
to
recover
himself
wallace
was
moving
away
when
he
was
met
by
ker
bringing
information
that
a
youth
had
just
arrived
in
breathless
haste
from
stirling
with
a
sealed
packet
which
he
would
not
deliver
into
any
hands
but
those
of
sir
william
wallace
wallace
requested
his
friends
to
show
every
attention
to
the
lord
of
thirlestane
and
then
withdrew
to
meet
the
messenger
on
his
entering
the
the
youth
sprung
forward
but
suddenly
checking
himself
he
stood
as
if
irresolute
whom
to
address
this
is
sir
william
wallace
young
man
said
ker
deliver
your
embassy
at
these
words
the
youth
pulled
a
packet
from
his
bosom
and
putting
it
into
the
chief
hand
retired
in
confusion
wallace
gave
orders
to
ker
to
take
care
of
him
and
then
turned
to
inspect
its
contents
he
wondered
from
whom
it
would
come
aware
of
no
scot
in
stirling
who
would
dare
to
write
to
him
while
that
town
was
possessed
by
the
enemy
but
not
losing
a
moment
in
conjecture
he
broke
the
seal
how
was
he
startled
at
the
first
words
and
how
was
every
energy
of
his
heart
roused
to
redoubled
action
when
he
turned
to
the
signature
the
first
words
in
the
letter
were
these
a
daughter
trembling
for
the
life
of
her
father
presumes
to
address
sir
william
wallace
the
signature
was
helen
mar
he
began
the
letter
again
a
daughter
trembling
for
the
life
of
her
father
presumes
to
address
sir
william
wallace
alas
it
will
be
a
long
letter
for
it
is
to
tell
of
our
countless
distresses
you
have
been
his
deliverer
from
the
sword
from
chains
and
from
the
waves
refuse
not
to
save
him
again
to
whom
you
have
so
often
given
life
and
hasten
brave
wallace
to
preserve
the
earl
of
mar
from
the
scaffold
a
cruel
deception
brought
him
from
the
isle
of
bute
where
you
imagined
you
had
left
him
in
security
lord
aymer
de
valence
escaping
a
second
time
from
your
sword
fled
under
rapacious
robber
of
all
our
castles
found
in
him
an
apt
coadjutor
they
concerted
how
to
avenge
your
late
successes
and
cressingham
eager
to
enrich
himself
while
he
flattered
the
resentments
of
his
commander
suggested
that
you
sir
william
wallace
our
deliverer
and
our
enemy
scourge
would
most
easily
be
made
to
feel
through
the
bosoms
of
your
friends
these
cruel
men
have
therefore
determined
by
a
mock
trial
to
condemn
my
father
to
death
and
thus
while
they
distress
you
put
themselves
in
possession
of
his
lands
with
the
semblance
of
justice
the
substance
of
this
most
unrighteous
debate
was
communicated
to
me
by
de
valence
himself
thinking
to
excuse
his
part
in
the
affair
by
proving
to
me
how
insensible
he
is
to
the
principles
which
move
alike
a
patriot
and
a
man
of
honor
having
learned
from
some
too
spy
that
lord
mar
had
retired
in
peaceful
obscurity
to
bute
these
to
our
country
sent
a
body
of
men
disguised
as
scots
to
gourock
there
they
dispatched
a
messenger
into
the
island
to
inform
lord
mar
that
sir
william
wallace
was
on
the
banks
of
the
frith
waiting
to
converse
with
him
my
noble
father
unsuspicious
of
treachery
hurried
to
the
summons
lady
mar
accompanied
him
and
so
both
fell
into
the
snare
they
were
brought
prisoners
to
stirling
where
another
affliction
awaited
him
was
to
see
his
daughter
and
his
sister
in
captivity
after
i
had
been
betrayed
from
fillian
monastery
by
the
falsehoods
of
one
scottish
knight
and
were
rescued
from
his
power
by
the
gallantry
of
another
i
sought
the
protection
of
my
aunt
lady
ruthven
who
then
dwelt
at
alloa
on
the
banks
of
the
forth
her
husband
had
been
invited
to
ayr
by
some
treacherous
requisition
of
the
governor
arnuf
and
with
many
other
lords
was
thrown
into
prison
report
says
bravest
of
men
that
you
have
given
freedom
to
my
betrayed
uncle
the
moment
lord
ruthven
person
was
secured
his
estates
were
seized
and
my
aunt
and
myself
being
found
at
alloa
we
were
carried
prisoners
to
this
city
alas
we
had
then
no
valiant
arm
to
preserve
us
from
our
enemies
lady
ruthven
first
born
son
was
slain
in
the
fatal
day
of
dunbar
and
in
terror
of
the
like
fate
she
placed
her
eldest
surviving
boy
in
a
convent
some
days
after
our
arrival
my
dear
father
was
brought
to
stirling
though
a
captive
in
the
town
i
was
not
then
confined
to
any
closer
durance
than
the
walls
while
he
was
yet
passing
through
the
streets
rumor
told
my
aunt
that
the
scottish
lord
then
leading
to
prison
was
her
beloved
brother
she
flew
to
me
in
agony
to
tell
me
the
dreadful
tidings
i
heard
no
more
saw
no
more
till
having
rushed
into
the
streets
and
bursting
through
every
obstacle
of
crowd
and
soldiers
i
found
myself
clasped
in
my
father
arms
in
his
shackled
arms
what
a
moment
was
that
where
was
sir
william
wallace
in
that
hour
where
the
brave
unknown
knight
who
had
sworn
to
me
to
seek
my
father
and
defend
him
with
his
life
both
were
absent
and
he
was
in
chains
my
grief
and
distraction
baffled
the
attempts
of
the
guards
to
part
us
and
what
became
of
me
i
know
not
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
couch
attended
by
many
women
and
supported
by
my
aunt
when
i
had
recovered
to
lamentation
and
to
tears
my
aunt
told
me
i
was
in
the
apartments
of
the
deputy
warden
he
with
cressingham
having
gone
out
to
meet
the
man
they
had
so
basely
drawn
into
their
toils
de
valence
himself
saw
the
struggles
of
paternal
affection
contending
against
the
men
who
would
have
torn
a
senseless
daughter
from
his
arms
and
yet
merciless
man
he
separated
us
and
sent
me
with
my
aunt
a
prisoner
to
his
house
the
next
day
a
packet
was
put
into
my
aunt
hands
containing
a
few
precious
lines
from
my
father
to
me
also
a
letter
from
the
countess
to
lady
ruthven
full
of
your
goodness
to
her
and
to
my
father
and
narrating
the
cruel
manner
in
which
they
had
been
ravished
from
the
asylum
in
which
you
had
placed
them
she
then
said
that
could
she
find
means
of
apprising
you
of
the
danger
to
which
she
and
her
husband
are
now
involved
she
would
be
sure
of
a
second
rescue
whether
she
has
blessedly
found
these
means
i
know
not
for
all
communication
between
us
since
the
delivery
of
that
letter
has
been
rendered
impracticable
the
messenger
that
brought
the
packet
was
a
good
southron
who
had
been
won
by
lady
mar
entreaties
but
on
his
quitting
our
apartments
he
was
seized
by
a
servant
of
de
valence
and
on
the
same
day
put
publicly
to
death
to
intimidate
all
others
from
the
like
compassion
to
the
sufferings
of
unhappy
scotland
oh
sir
william
wallace
will
not
your
sword
reach
these
men
of
blood
earl
de
valence
compelled
my
aunt
to
yield
the
packet
to
him
we
had
already
read
it
therefore
did
not
regret
it
on
that
head
but
feared
the
information
it
might
give
relative
to
you
in
consequence
of
this
circumstance
i
was
made
a
closer
prisoner
but
captivity
could
have
no
terrors
for
me
did
it
not
divide
me
from
my
father
and
grief
on
grief
what
words
have
i
to
write
it
they
have
condemned
him
to
die
that
fatal
letter
of
my
was
brought
out
against
him
and
as
your
adherent
sir
william
wallace
they
have
sentenced
him
to
lose
his
head
i
have
knelt
to
earl
de
valence
i
have
implored
my
father
life
at
his
hands
but
to
no
purpose
he
tells
me
that
cressingham
at
his
side
and
ormsby
by
letters
from
scone
declare
it
necessary
that
an
execution
of
consequence
should
be
made
to
appall
the
discontented
scots
and
that
as
no
lord
is
more
esteemed
in
scotland
than
the
earl
of
mar
he
must
be
the
sacrifice
hasten
then
my
father
preserver
and
friend
hasten
to
save
him
oh
fly
for
the
sake
of
the
country
he
loves
for
the
sake
of
the
hapless
beings
dependent
on
his
protection
i
shall
be
on
my
knees
till
i
hear
your
trumpet
before
the
walls
for
in
you
and
heaven
now
rest
all
the
hopes
of
helen
mar
a
cold
dew
stood
on
the
limbs
of
wallace
as
he
closed
the
letter
it
might
be
too
late
the
sentence
was
passed
on
the
earl
and
his
executioners
were
prompt
as
cruel
the
ax
might
already
have
fallen
he
called
to
ker
for
the
messenger
to
be
brought
in
he
entered
wallace
inquired
how
long
he
had
been
from
stirling
only
hours
replied
the
youth
adding
that
he
had
traveled
night
and
day
for
fear
the
news
of
the
risings
in
annandale
and
the
taking
of
berwick
should
precipitate
the
earl
death
i
accompany
you
this
instant
cried
wallace
ker
see
that
the
troops
get
under
arms
as
he
spoke
he
turned
into
the
room
where
he
had
left
the
knight
of
thirlestane
sir
richard
maitland
said
he
willing
to
avoid
exciting
his
alarm
there
is
more
work
for
us
at
stirling
lord
aymer
de
valence
has
again
escaped
the
death
we
thought
had
overtaken
him
and
is
now
in
that
citadel
i
have
just
received
a
summons
thither
which
i
must
obey
at
these
words
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
gave
a
shout
and
rushed
from
the
apartment
wallace
looked
after
him
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
follow
us
with
your
prayers
sir
richard
and
i
shall
not
despair
of
sending
blessed
tidings
to
the
banks
of
the
lauder
what
has
happened
inquired
murray
who
saw
that
something
more
than
the
escape
of
de
valence
had
been
imparted
to
his
general
we
must
spare
this
good
old
man
returned
he
and
have
him
conducted
to
his
home
before
i
declare
it
publicly
but
the
earl
of
mar
is
again
a
prisoner
and
in
stirling
murray
who
instantly
comprehended
his
uncle
danger
speeded
the
departure
of
sir
richard
and
as
wallace
held
his
stirrup
the
chief
laid
his
hand
on
his
head
and
blessed
him
the
seer
of
ercildown
is
too
ill
to
bring
his
benediction
himself
but
i
breathe
it
over
this
heroic
brow
wallace
bowed
his
head
in
silence
and
the
bridle
being
in
the
hand
of
lord
andrew
he
led
the
horse
out
of
the
eastern
gate
of
the
town
where
taking
leave
of
the
veteran
knight
he
soon
rejoined
his
commander
whom
he
found
in
the
midst
of
his
chieftains
he
had
informed
them
of
the
earl
of
mar
danger
and
the
policy
as
well
as
justice
of
rescuing
so
powerful
and
patriotic
a
nobleman
from
the
threatened
execution
lord
ruthven
needed
no
arguments
to
precipitate
him
to
the
assistance
of
his
brother
and
his
wife
and
the
anxieties
of
the
affectionate
edwin
were
all
awake
when
he
knew
that
his
mother
was
a
prisoner
lord
andrew
smiled
proudly
when
he
returned
his
cousin
letter
to
wallace
we
shall
have
the
rogue
on
the
nail
yet
cried
he
my
uncle
brave
head
is
not
ordained
to
fall
by
the
stroke
of
such
a
coward
so
i
believe
replied
wallace
and
then
turning
to
lord
my
lord
said
he
i
leave
you
governor
of
berwick
the
veteran
warrior
grasped
wallace
hand
to
be
your
representative
in
this
fortress
is
the
proudest
station
this
warworn
frame
hath
ever
filled
my
son
must
be
my
representative
with
you
in
the
field
he
waved
sir
john
graham
toward
him
the
young
knight
advanced
and
lord
dundaff
placing
his
son
hands
upon
his
target
continued
swear
that
as
this
defends
the
body
you
will
ever
strive
to
cover
scotland
from
her
enemies
and
that
from
this
hour
you
will
be
the
faithful
friend
and
follower
of
sir
william
wallace
i
swear
returned
graham
kissing
the
shield
wallace
pressed
his
hand
i
have
brothers
around
me
rather
than
what
the
world
calls
friends
and
with
such
valor
such
fidelity
to
aid
me
can
i
be
otherwise
than
a
victor
heaven
anointed
sword
is
with
such
fellowship
edwin
who
stood
near
this
rite
of
generous
enthusiasm
softly
whispered
to
wallace
as
he
turned
toward
his
troops
but
amongst
all
these
brothers
cease
not
to
remember
edwin
the
youngest
and
the
least
ah
my
beloved
general
what
jonathan
was
to
david
i
would
be
to
thee
wallace
looked
on
him
with
penetrating
tenderness
his
heart
was
suddenly
wrung
by
a
recollection
which
the
words
of
edwin
had
recalled
but
thy
love
edwin
passes
not
the
love
of
woman
but
it
equals
it
replied
he
what
has
been
done
for
thee
i
would
do
only
love
me
as
david
did
jonathan
and
i
shall
be
the
happiest
of
the
happy
be
happy
then
dear
boy
answered
wallace
for
all
that
ever
beat
in
human
breast
for
friend
or
brother
lives
in
my
heart
for
thee
at
that
moment
sir
john
graham
rejoined
them
and
some
other
captains
coming
up
wallace
made
the
proper
military
dispositions
and
every
man
took
his
station
at
the
head
of
his
division
until
the
men
had
marched
far
beyond
the
chance
of
rumors
reaching
thirlestane
they
were
not
informed
of
the
earl
of
mar
danger
they
conceived
their
present
errand
was
the
recapture
of
de
valence
but
at
a
proper
moment
said
wallace
they
shall
know
the
whole
truth
for
added
he
as
it
is
a
law
of
equity
that
what
concerns
all
should
be
approved
by
all
and
that
common
dangers
should
be
repelled
by
united
efforts
the
people
who
follow
our
standards
not
as
hirelings
but
with
willing
spirits
ought
to
know
our
reasons
for
requiring
their
services
they
who
follow
you
said
graham
have
too
much
confidence
in
their
leader
to
require
any
reasons
for
his
movements
it
is
to
place
that
confidence
on
a
sure
foundation
my
brave
friends
returned
wallace
that
i
explain
what
there
is
no
just
reason
to
conceal
should
policy
ever
compel
me
to
strike
a
blow
without
previously
telling
my
agents
wherefore
i
should
then
draw
upon
their
faith
and
expect
that
confidence
in
my
honor
and
arms
which
i
now
place
on
their
discretion
and
fidelity
exordiums
were
not
requisite
to
nerve
every
limb
and
to
strengthen
every
heart
in
the
toilsome
journey
mountains
were
climbed
vast
plains
traversed
rivers
forded
and
precipices
crossed
without
one
man
in
the
ranks
lingering
on
its
steps
or
dropping
his
head
upon
his
pike
to
catch
a
moment
slumber
those
who
had
fought
with
wallace
longed
to
redouble
their
fame
under
his
command
and
they
who
had
recently
embraced
his
standard
panted
with
a
virtuous
ambition
to
rival
those
in
arms
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
had
been
the
first
to
fly
to
arms
on
the
march
to
stirling
being
mentioned
and
when
wallace
stood
forward
to
declare
that
rest
should
be
dispensed
with
till
stirling
fell
full
of
a
fierce
joy
the
ardent
knight
darted
over
every
obstacle
to
reach
his
aim
he
flew
to
the
van
of
his
troops
and
hailing
them
forward
come
on
cried
he
and
in
the
blood
of
cressingham
let
us
forever
sink
king
edward
scottish
crown
the
shouts
of
the
men
who
seemed
to
drink
in
the
spirit
that
blazed
from
kirkpatrick
eyes
made
the
echoes
of
lammermuir
ring
with
a
noise
it
was
the
voice
of
liberty
leaping
every
bound
the
eager
van
led
the
way
and
with
prodigious
perseverance
dragging
their
in
the
rear
the
rest
pressed
on
till
they
reached
the
carron
side
at
the
moment
the
foaming
steed
of
wallace
smoking
with
the
labors
of
a
long
and
rapid
march
was
plunging
into
the
stream
to
take
the
form
ker
snatched
the
bridle
of
the
horse
my
lord
cried
he
a
man
on
full
speed
from
douglas
castle
has
brought
this
packet
in
his
march
to
ayr
wallace
had
left
sir
eustace
maxwell
governor
of
that
castle
and
monteith
as
his
lieutenant
wallace
opened
the
packet
and
read
as
follows
the
patriots
in
annandale
have
been
beaten
by
lord
de
warenne
sir
john
monteith
who
volunteered
to
head
them
is
taken
prisoner
with
twelve
hundred
men
earl
de
warenne
comes
to
resume
his
arrogant
title
of
lord
warden
of
scotland
and
thereby
to
relieve
his
deputy
aymer
de
valence
who
is
recalled
to
take
possession
of
the
lordship
of
pembroke
in
pursuance
of
his
usurping
commission
the
earl
is
now
marching
rapidly
toward
the
lothians
in
the
hope
of
intercepting
you
in
your
progress
thanks
to
the
constant
information
you
send
us
of
your
movements
for
being
able
to
surprise
you
of
this
danger
i
should
have
attempted
to
have
checked
the
southron
by
annoying
his
flanks
had
not
his
numbers
rendered
such
an
enterprise
on
my
part
hopeless
but
his
aim
being
to
come
up
with
you
if
you
meet
him
in
the
van
we
shall
have
him
in
the
rear
and
so
surrounded
he
must
be
cut
to
pieces
surely
the
tree
you
planted
in
dumbarton
is
not
now
to
be
blasted
ever
your
general
and
scotland
true
servant
eustace
maxwell
what
answer
inquired
ker
wallace
hastily
engraved
with
his
dagger
point
upon
his
gauntlet
reviresco
our
sun
is
above
and
desiring
it
to
be
given
to
the
messenger
to
carry
to
sir
eustace
maxwell
he
refixed
himself
in
his
saddle
and
spurred
over
the
carron
means
i
bud
again
this
encouraging
word
is
now
the
reuto
of
the
maxwell
arms
the
moon
was
near
her
meridian
as
the
wearied
troops
halted
on
the
deep
shadows
of
the
carse
of
stirling
all
around
them
was
desolation
the
sword
and
the
fire
had
been
there
not
in
open
declared
warfare
but
under
the
darkness
of
midnight
and
impelled
by
rapacity
and
wantonness
hence
from
the
base
of
the
rock
even
to
the
foot
of
the
clackmannan
hills
all
lay
a
smoking
wilderness
an
hour
rest
was
sufficient
to
restore
every
exhausted
power
to
the
limbs
of
the
determined
followers
of
wallace
and
as
the
morning
dawned
the
sentinels
on
the
ramparts
of
the
town
were
not
only
surprised
to
see
a
host
below
but
that
by
the
most
indefatigable
labor
and
a
silence
like
death
had
not
merely
passed
the
ditch
but
having
gained
the
counterscarp
had
fixed
their
movable
towers
and
were
at
that
instant
overlooking
the
highest
bastions
the
mangonels
and
petraries
and
other
implements
for
battering
walls
and
the
ballista
with
every
efficient
means
of
throwing
missive
weapons
were
ready
to
discharge
their
artillery
upon
the
heads
of
the
beseiged
at
a
sight
so
unexpected
which
seemed
to
have
arisen
out
of
the
earth
like
an
exhalation
with
such
muteness
and
expedition
had
the
scottish
operations
been
carried
on
the
southrons
struck
with
dread
fled
a
moment
from
the
walls
but
immediately
recovering
their
presence
of
mind
they
returned
and
discharged
a
cloud
of
arrows
upon
their
assailants
a
messenger
meanwhile
was
sent
into
the
citadel
to
apprise
de
valence
and
the
governor
cressingham
of
the
assault
the
interior
gates
now
sent
forth
thousands
to
the
walls
but
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
which
approached
the
greater
was
the
harvest
of
death
prepared
for
the
terrible
arm
of
wallace
whose
tremendous
war
wolves
throwing
prodigious
stones
and
lighter
springalls
casting
forth
brazen
darts
swept
away
file
after
file
of
the
reinforcements
it
grieved
the
noble
heart
of
the
scottish
commander
to
see
so
many
valiant
men
urged
to
inevitable
destruction
but
still
they
advanced
and
that
his
own
might
be
preserved
they
must
fall
to
shorten
the
bloody
contest
his
direful
weapons
were
worked
with
redoubled
energy
and
so
mortal
a
shower
fell
that
the
heavens
seemed
to
rain
iron
the
crushed
and
stricken
enemy
shrinking
under
the
mighty
tempest
forsook
their
ground
the
ramparts
deserted
wallace
sprung
from
his
tower
upon
the
walls
at
that
moment
de
valence
opened
one
of
the
gates
and
at
the
head
of
a
formidable
body
charged
the
nearest
scots
a
good
soldier
is
never
taken
unawares
and
murray
and
graham
were
prepared
to
receive
him
furiously
driving
him
to
a
retrograde
motion
they
forced
him
back
into
the
town
but
there
all
was
confusion
wallace
with
his
resolute
followers
had
already
put
cressingham
and
his
legions
to
flight
and
closely
pursued
by
kirkpatrick
they
threw
themselves
into
the
castle
meanwhile
the
victorious
wallace
surrounded
the
amazed
de
valence
who
caught
in
double
toils
called
to
his
men
to
fight
for
their
king
and
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
the
brave
fellows
too
strictly
obeyed
and
while
they
fell
on
all
sides
he
supported
them
with
a
courage
which
horror
of
vengeance
for
his
grandfather
death
and
the
attempt
on
his
own
life
in
the
hall
at
dumbarton
rendered
desperate
at
last
he
encountered
the
conquering
chief
arm
to
arm
great
was
the
dismay
of
de
valence
at
this
meeting
but
as
death
was
now
all
he
saw
before
him
he
resolved
if
he
must
die
that
the
soul
of
his
enemy
should
attend
him
to
the
other
world
he
fought
not
with
the
steady
valor
of
a
warrior
determined
to
vanquish
or
die
but
with
the
fury
of
despair
with
the
violence
of
a
hyena
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
his
opponent
drunk
with
rage
he
made
a
desperate
plunge
at
the
heart
of
wallace
a
plunge
armed
with
execrations
and
all
his
strength
but
his
sword
missed
its
aim
and
entered
the
side
of
a
youth
who
at
that
moment
had
thrown
himself
before
his
general
wallace
saw
where
the
deadly
blow
fell
and
instantly
closing
on
the
earl
with
a
vengeance
in
his
eyes
which
reminded
his
now
determined
victim
of
the
horrid
vision
he
had
seen
in
the
burning
barns
of
ayr
with
one
grasp
of
his
arm
the
incensed
chief
hurled
him
to
the
ground
and
setting
his
foot
upon
his
breast
would
have
buried
his
dagger
there
had
not
de
valence
dropped
his
uplifted
sword
and
with
horror
in
every
feature
raised
his
clasped
hands
in
speechless
supplication
wallace
suspended
the
blow
and
de
valence
exclaimed
my
life
this
once
again
gallant
wallace
by
your
hopes
of
heaven
grant
me
mercy
wallace
looked
on
the
trembling
recreant
with
a
glare
which
had
he
possessed
the
soul
of
a
man
would
have
made
him
grasp
at
death
rather
than
deserve
a
second
and
hast
thou
escaped
me
again
cried
wallace
then
turning
his
indignant
eyes
from
the
abject
earl
to
his
bleeding
i
yield
him
his
life
edwin
and
you
perhaps
are
slain
forget
not
our
own
bright
principle
to
avenge
me
said
edwin
as
brightly
smiling
he
has
only
wounded
me
but
you
are
safe
and
i
hardly
feel
a
smart
wallace
replaced
his
dagger
in
his
girdle
rise
lord
de
valence
it
is
my
honor
not
my
will
that
grants
your
life
you
threw
away
your
arms
i
can
not
strike
even
a
murderer
who
bares
his
breast
i
give
you
that
mercy
you
denied
to
nineteen
unoffending
defenseless
old
men
whose
hoary
heads
your
ruthless
ax
brought
with
blood
to
the
ground
let
memory
be
the
sword
i
have
withheld
while
he
spoke
de
valence
had
risen
and
stood
before
the
majestic
mien
of
wallace
there
was
something
in
this
denunciation
that
sounded
like
the
irreversible
decree
of
a
divinity
and
the
condemned
wretch
quaked
beneath
the
threat
while
he
panted
for
revenge
the
whole
of
the
survivors
in
de
valence
train
having
surrendered
themselves
when
their
leader
fell
in
a
few
minutes
wallace
was
surrounded
by
his
chieftains
bringing
in
the
colors
and
the
swords
of
their
prisoners
sir
alexander
ramsay
said
he
to
a
brave
and
courteous
knight
who
with
his
kinsman
william
blair
had
joined
him
in
the
lothians
i
confide
earl
de
valence
to
your
care
see
that
he
is
strongly
guarded
and
has
every
respect
according
to
the
honor
of
him
to
whom
i
commit
this
charge
the
town
was
now
in
possession
of
the
scots
and
wallace
having
sent
off
the
rest
of
his
prisoners
to
safe
quarters
reiterated
his
persuasions
to
edwin
to
have
the
ground
and
submit
his
wounds
to
the
surgeon
no
no
replied
he
the
same
hand
that
gave
me
this
inflicted
a
worse
on
my
general
at
dumbarton
he
kept
the
field
then
and
shall
i
retire
now
and
disgrace
my
example
no
my
brother
you
would
not
have
me
so
disprove
my
kindred
do
as
you
will
answered
wallace
with
a
grateful
smile
so
that
you
preserve
a
life
that
must
never
again
be
risked
to
save
mine
while
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
live
my
almighty
captain
will
shield
me
but
when
his
word
goes
forth
that
i
shall
be
recalled
it
will
not
be
in
the
power
of
friendship
nor
of
hosts
to
turn
the
steel
from
my
breast
therefore
dearest
edwin
thrown
not
yourself
away
in
defending
what
is
in
the
hands
of
heaven
to
be
lent
or
to
be
withdrawn
at
will
edwin
bowed
his
modest
head
and
having
suffered
a
balsam
to
be
poured
into
his
wound
braced
his
brigandine
over
his
breast
and
was
again
at
the
side
of
his
friend
just
as
he
had
joined
kirkpatrick
before
the
citadel
the
gates
were
firmly
closed
and
the
dismayed
cressingham
was
panting
behind
its
walls
as
wallace
commanded
the
parley
to
be
sounded
afraid
of
trusting
himself
within
of
an
enemy
who
he
believed
conquered
by
witchcraft
the
terrified
governor
sent
his
lieutenant
up
on
the
walls
to
answer
the
summons
the
herald
of
the
scots
demanded
the
immediate
surrender
of
the
place
cressingham
was
at
that
instant
informed
by
a
messenger
who
had
arrived
too
late
the
preceding
night
to
be
allowed
to
disturb
his
slumbers
that
de
warenne
was
approaching
with
an
immense
army
inflated
with
new
confidence
he
mounted
the
wall
himself
and
in
haughty
language
returned
for
answer
that
he
would
fall
under
the
towers
of
the
citadel
before
he
would
surrender
to
a
scottish
rebel
and
as
an
example
of
the
fate
which
such
a
delinquent
merits
continued
he
i
will
change
the
milder
sentence
passed
on
lord
mar
and
immediately
hang
him
and
all
his
family
on
these
ramparts
in
sight
of
your
insurgent
army
then
cried
the
herald
thus
says
sir
william
wallace
if
even
one
hair
on
the
heads
of
the
earl
of
mar
and
his
family
falls
with
violence
to
the
ground
every
southron
soul
who
has
this
day
surrendered
to
the
scottish
arms
shall
lose
his
head
by
the
ax
we
are
used
to
the
blood
of
traitors
cried
cressingham
and
mind
not
its
scent
but
the
army
of
earl
de
warenne
is
at
hand
and
it
is
at
the
peril
of
all
your
necks
for
the
rebel
your
master
to
put
his
threat
in
execution
withdraw
or
you
shall
see
the
dead
bodies
of
donald
mar
and
his
family
fringing
these
battlements
for
no
terms
do
we
keep
with
man
woman
or
child
who
is
linked
with
treason
at
these
words
an
arrow
winged
from
a
hand
behind
cressingham
flew
directly
to
the
unvisored
face
of
wallace
but
it
struck
too
high
and
ringing
against
his
helmet
fell
to
the
ground
treachery
resounded
from
every
scottish
lip
while
indignant
at
so
villainous
a
rupture
of
the
parley
every
bow
was
drawn
to
the
head
and
a
flight
of
arrows
armed
with
retribution
flew
toward
the
battlements
all
hands
were
now
at
work
to
bring
the
towers
to
the
wall
and
mounting
on
them
while
the
archers
by
their
rapid
showers
drove
the
men
from
the
ramparts
soldiers
below
with
pickaxes
dug
into
the
wall
to
make
a
breach
cressingham
began
to
fear
that
his
boasted
auxiliaries
might
arrive
too
late
but
determining
to
gain
time
at
least
he
shot
flights
of
darts
and
large
stones
from
a
thousand
engines
also
discharged
burning
combustibles
over
the
ramparts
in
hopes
of
setting
fire
to
the
attacking
machines
but
all
his
promptitude
proved
of
no
effect
the
walls
were
giving
way
in
parts
and
wallace
was
mounting
by
and
clasping
the
parapets
with
bridges
from
his
towers
driven
to
extremity
cressingham
resolved
to
try
the
attachment
of
the
scots
for
lord
mar
and
even
at
the
moment
when
their
chief
had
seized
the
barbican
and
outer
ballium
this
sanguinary
politician
ordered
the
imprisoned
earl
to
be
brought
out
upon
the
wall
of
the
inner
ballia
a
rope
was
round
his
neck
which
was
instantly
run
through
a
groove
that
projected
from
the
nearest
tower
at
this
sight
horror
froze
the
ardent
blood
of
wallace
but
the
intrepid
earl
descrying
his
friend
on
the
ladder
which
might
soon
carry
him
to
the
summit
of
the
battlement
exclaimed
forward
let
not
my
span
of
life
stand
between
my
country
and
this
glorious
day
for
scotland
freedom
execute
the
sentence
cried
the
infuriate
cressingham
at
these
words
murray
and
edwin
precipitated
themselves
upon
the
ramparts
and
mowed
down
all
before
them
in
a
direction
toward
their
uncle
the
lieutenant
who
held
the
cord
aware
of
the
impolicy
of
the
cruel
mandate
hesitated
to
fulfill
it
and
now
fearing
a
rescue
from
the
impetuous
scots
hurried
his
victim
off
the
works
back
to
his
prison
meanwhile
cressingham
perceiving
that
all
would
be
lost
should
he
suffer
the
enemy
to
gain
this
wall
also
sent
such
numbers
upon
the
brave
scots
who
had
followed
the
cousins
that
overcoming
some
and
repelling
others
they
threw
murray
with
a
sudden
shock
over
the
ramparts
edwin
was
surrounded
and
his
successful
adversaries
were
bearing
him
off
struggling
and
bleeding
when
wallace
springing
like
a
lioness
on
hunters
carrying
away
her
young
rushed
in
singly
amongst
them
he
seized
edwin
and
while
his
falchion
flashed
terrible
threatenings
in
their
eyes
with
a
backward
step
he
fought
his
passage
to
one
of
the
wooden
towers
he
had
fastened
to
the
wall
cressingham
being
wounded
in
the
head
commanded
a
parley
to
be
sounded
we
have
already
taken
lord
de
valence
and
his
host
prisoners
returned
wallace
and
we
grant
you
no
cessation
of
hostilities
till
you
deliver
up
the
earl
of
mar
and
his
family
and
surrender
the
castle
into
our
hands
think
not
proud
boaster
cried
the
herald
of
cressingham
that
we
ask
a
parley
to
conciliate
it
was
to
tell
you
that
if
you
do
not
draw
off
directly
not
only
the
earl
of
mar
and
his
family
but
every
scottish
prisoner
within
these
walls
shall
perish
in
your
sight
while
he
yet
spoke
the
southrons
uttered
a
great
shout
and
the
scots
looking
up
beheld
several
high
poles
erected
on
the
roof
of
the
keep
and
the
earl
of
mar
as
before
was
led
forward
but
he
seemed
no
longer
the
bold
and
tranquil
patriot
he
was
surrounded
by
shrieking
female
forms
clinging
to
his
knees
and
his
trembling
hands
were
lifted
to
heaven
as
if
imploring
its
pity
stop
cried
wallace
in
a
voice
whose
thundering
mandate
rung
from
tower
to
tower
the
instant
he
dies
lord
aymer
de
valence
shall
perish
he
had
only
to
make
the
sign
and
in
a
few
minutes
that
nobleman
appeared
between
ramsay
and
kirkpatrick
earl
exclaimed
wallace
though
i
granted
your
life
in
the
field
with
reluctance
yet
here
i
am
ashamed
to
put
it
in
danger
but
your
own
people
compel
me
look
at
that
spectacle
a
venerable
father
in
the
midst
of
his
family
he
and
they
doomed
to
an
ignominious
and
instant
death
unless
i
betray
my
country
and
abandon
these
walls
were
i
weak
enough
to
purchase
their
lives
at
such
an
expense
they
could
not
survive
that
disgrace
but
that
they
shall
not
die
while
i
have
the
power
to
preserve
them
is
my
resolve
and
my
duty
life
then
for
life
yours
for
this
family
wallace
directing
his
voice
toward
the
keep
the
moment
cried
he
in
which
that
vile
cord
presses
too
closely
on
the
neck
of
the
earl
of
mar
or
any
of
his
blood
the
ax
shall
sever
the
head
of
lord
de
valence
from
his
body
de
valence
was
now
seen
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
besieging
towers
he
was
pale
as
death
he
trembled
but
not
with
dismay
only
ten
thousand
varying
emotions
tore
his
breast
to
be
thus
set
up
as
a
monument
of
his
own
defeat
to
be
threatened
with
execution
by
an
enemy
he
had
contemned
to
be
exposed
to
such
indignities
by
the
unthinking
ferocity
of
his
colleague
filled
him
with
such
contending
passions
of
revenge
against
friends
and
foes
that
he
forgot
the
present
fear
of
death
in
turbulent
wishes
to
deprive
of
life
all
by
whom
he
suffered
cressingham
became
alarmed
on
seeing
the
retaliating
menace
of
wallace
brought
so
directly
before
his
view
and
dreading
the
vengeance
of
de
valence
powerful
family
he
ordered
a
herald
to
say
that
if
wallace
would
draw
off
his
troops
to
the
outer
ballium
and
the
english
chief
along
with
them
the
lord
mar
and
his
family
should
be
taken
from
their
perilous
situation
and
he
would
consider
on
terms
of
surrender
aware
that
cressingham
only
wanted
to
gain
time
until
de
warenne
should
arrive
wallace
determined
to
foil
him
with
his
own
weapons
and
make
the
gaining
of
the
castle
the
consequence
of
vanquishing
the
earl
he
told
the
now
perplexed
governor
that
he
should
consider
lord
de
valence
as
the
hostage
of
safety
for
lord
mar
and
his
family
and
therefore
he
consented
to
withdraw
his
men
from
the
inner
ballium
till
the
setting
of
the
sun
at
which
hour
he
should
expect
a
herald
with
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
thinking
that
he
had
caught
the
scottish
chief
in
a
snare
and
that
the
lord
warden
army
would
be
upon
him
long
before
the
expiration
of
the
armistice
cressingham
congratulated
himself
upon
this
maneuver
and
resolving
that
the
moment
earl
de
warenne
should
appear
lord
mar
should
be
secretly
destroyed
in
the
dungeons
he
ordered
them
to
their
security
again
wallace
fully
comprehended
what
were
his
enemy
views
and
what
ought
to
be
his
own
measures
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
unhappy
group
disappear
from
the
battlements
of
the
keep
he
then
recalled
his
men
from
the
inner
ballium
wall
and
stationing
several
detachments
along
the
ramparts
and
in
the
towers
of
the
outer
wall
committed
de
valence
to
the
stronghold
of
the
barbican
under
the
especial
charge
of
lord
ruthven
who
was
indeed
eager
to
hold
the
means
in
his
own
hand
that
were
to
check
the
threatened
danger
of
relatives
so
dear
to
him
as
were
the
prisoners
in
the
castle
chapter
xxxiii
having
secured
the
advantages
he
had
gained
in
the
town
and
on
the
works
of
the
castle
by
manning
all
the
strong
places
wallace
set
forward
with
his
chosen
troops
to
intercept
de
warenne
he
took
his
position
on
a
commanding
ground
about
half
a
mile
from
stirling
near
to
the
abbey
of
the
forth
lay
before
him
crossed
by
a
wooden
bridge
over
which
the
enemy
must
pass
to
reach
him
the
river
not
being
fordable
in
that
part
he
ordered
the
timbers
which
supported
the
bridge
to
be
sawed
at
the
bottom
but
not
displaced
in
the
least
that
they
might
stand
perfectly
firm
for
as
long
as
he
should
deem
it
necessary
to
these
timbers
were
fastened
strong
cords
all
of
which
he
intrusted
to
the
sturdiest
of
his
lanark
men
who
were
to
lie
concealed
amongst
the
flags
these
preparations
being
made
he
drew
up
his
troops
in
order
of
battle
kirkpatrick
and
murray
commanded
the
flanks
in
the
center
stood
wallace
himself
with
ramsay
on
one
side
of
him
and
edwin
with
scrymgeour
on
the
other
awaiting
with
steady
expectation
the
approach
of
the
enemy
who
by
this
time
could
not
be
far
distant
cressingham
was
not
less
of
the
advance
of
de
warenne
and
burning
with
revenge
against
wallace
and
earnest
to
redeem
the
favor
of
de
valence
by
some
act
in
his
behalf
he
first
gave
secret
orders
to
his
lieutenant
then
set
forth
alone
to
seek
an
avenue
of
escape
never
divulged
to
any
but
to
the
commanders
of
the
fortress
he
soon
discovered
it
and
by
the
light
of
a
torch
making
his
way
through
a
passage
bored
in
the
rock
emerged
at
its
western
base
screened
from
sight
by
the
surrounding
bushes
he
had
disguised
himself
in
a
shepherd
bonnet
and
plaid
in
case
of
being
observed
by
the
enemy
but
fortune
favored
him
and
unseen
he
crept
along
through
the
thickets
till
he
descried
the
advance
of
de
warenne
army
on
the
skirts
of
tor
wood
having
missed
wallace
in
west
lothian
de
warenne
divided
his
army
into
three
divisions
to
enter
stirlingshire
by
different
routes
and
so
he
hoped
certainly
to
intercept
him
in
one
of
them
the
earl
of
montgomery
led
the
first
of
twenty
thousand
men
the
barons
hilton
and
blenkinsopp
the
second
of
ten
thousand
and
de
warenne
himself
the
third
of
thirty
thousand
it
was
the
first
of
these
divisions
that
cressingham
encountered
in
tor
wood
and
revealing
himself
to
montgomery
he
recounted
how
rapidly
wallace
had
gained
the
town
and
in
what
jeopardy
the
citadel
would
be
if
he
were
not
instantly
attacked
the
earl
advised
waiting
for
a
junction
with
hilton
or
the
lord
warden
which
said
he
must
happen
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
returned
cressingham
you
will
have
no
stirling
castle
to
defend
the
enemy
will
seize
it
at
sunset
in
pursuance
of
the
very
agreement
by
which
i
warded
him
off
to
give
us
time
to
annihilate
him
before
that
hour
therefore
no
hesitation
if
we
would
not
see
him
lock
the
gates
of
the
north
of
scotland
upon
us
even
when
we
have
the
power
to
hurl
him
to
perdition
by
arguments
such
as
these
the
young
earl
was
induced
to
give
up
his
judgment
and
accompanied
by
cressingham
whose
courage
revived
amid
such
a
host
he
proceeded
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
forth
the
bands
of
wallace
were
drawn
up
on
the
opposite
shore
hardly
five
thousand
strong
but
so
disposed
the
enemy
could
not
calculate
their
numbers
though
the
narrowness
of
their
front
suggested
to
cressingham
that
they
could
not
be
numerous
and
he
recollected
that
many
must
have
been
left
to
occupy
the
outworks
of
the
town
and
the
citadel
it
will
be
easy
to
surround
the
rebel
cried
he
and
that
we
may
effect
our
enterprise
before
the
arrival
of
the
warden
robs
us
of
the
honor
let
us
about
it
directly
and
cross
the
bridge
montgomery
proposed
a
herald
being
sent
to
inform
wallace
that
besides
the
long
line
of
troops
he
saw
de
warenne
was
advancing
with
double
hosts
and
if
he
would
now
surrender
a
pardon
should
be
granted
to
him
and
his
in
the
king
name
for
all
their
late
rebellions
cressingham
was
vehement
against
this
measure
but
montgomery
being
resolute
the
messenger
was
dispatched
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
and
repeated
to
the
southron
commanders
the
words
of
wallace
go
said
he
tell
your
masters
we
came
not
here
to
treat
for
a
pardon
of
what
we
shall
never
allow
to
be
an
offense
we
came
to
assert
our
rights
to
set
scotland
free
till
that
is
effected
all
negotiation
is
vain
let
them
advance
they
will
find
us
prepared
then
onward
cried
montgomery
and
spurring
his
steed
he
led
the
way
to
the
bridge
his
eager
soldiers
followed
and
the
whole
of
his
center
ranks
passed
over
the
flanks
advanced
and
the
bridge
from
end
to
end
was
filled
with
archers
cavalry
and
cressingham
in
the
midst
was
hallooing
in
proud
triumph
to
those
who
occupied
the
rear
of
the
straining
beams
when
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
sounded
from
the
till
now
silent
and
immovable
scottish
phalanx
it
was
by
shouts
from
behind
the
passing
enemy
and
in
that
moment
the
supporting
piers
of
the
were
pulled
away
and
the
whole
of
its
mailed
throng
was
precipitated
into
the
stream
historical
fact
relating
to
the
bridge
is
yet
exultantly
repeated
on
the
spot
and
the
number
of
the
southrons
who
fell
beneath
the
arms
of
so
small
a
band
of
scots
is
not
less
the
theme
of
the
cries
of
the
maimed
and
the
drowning
were
joined
by
the
terrific
slogan
of
two
bands
of
scots
the
one
with
wallace
toward
the
head
of
the
river
while
the
other
under
the
command
of
sir
john
graham
rushed
from
its
ambuscade
on
the
opposite
bank
upon
the
rear
of
the
dismayed
troops
and
both
divisions
sweeping
all
before
them
drove
those
who
fought
on
land
into
the
river
and
those
who
had
just
escaped
the
flood
to
meet
its
waves
again
a
bleeding
host
in
the
midst
of
this
conflict
which
rather
seemed
a
carnage
than
a
battle
kirkpatrick
having
heard
the
proud
shouts
of
cressingham
on
the
bridge
now
sought
him
amidst
its
shattered
timbers
with
the
ferocity
of
a
tiger
hunting
its
prey
he
ran
from
man
to
man
and
as
the
struggling
wretches
emerged
from
the
water
he
plucked
them
from
the
surge
but
even
while
his
glaring
and
uplifted
ax
threatened
destruction
he
only
looked
on
them
and
with
imprecations
of
disapointment
rushed
forward
on
his
chase
almost
in
despair
that
the
waves
had
cheated
his
revenge
he
was
hurrying
on
in
another
direction
when
he
perceived
a
body
moving
through
a
hollow
on
his
right
he
turned
and
saw
the
object
of
his
search
crawling
amongst
the
mud
and
sedges
ha
cried
kirkpatrick
with
a
triumphant
yell
art
thou
yet
mine
damned
damned
villain
cried
he
springing
upon
his
breast
behold
the
man
you
dishonored
the
hot
cheek
your
dastard
hand
defiled
thy
blood
shall
obliterate
the
stain
and
then
kirkpatrick
may
again
front
the
proudest
in
scotland
for
mercy
cried
the
cressingham
struggling
with
preternatural
strength
to
extricate
himself
hell
would
be
my
portion
did
i
grant
any
to
thee
cried
kirkpatrick
and
with
one
stroke
of
the
ax
he
severed
the
head
from
its
body
i
am
a
man
again
shouted
he
as
he
held
its
bleeding
veins
in
his
hand
and
placed
it
on
the
point
of
his
sword
thou
ruthless
priest
of
moloch
and
of
mammon
thou
shalt
have
thine
own
blood
to
drink
while
i
show
my
general
how
proudly
i
am
avenged
as
he
spoke
he
dashed
amongst
the
victorious
ranks
and
reached
wallace
at
the
very
moment
he
was
freeing
himself
from
his
fallen
horse
which
a
random
arrow
had
shot
under
him
murray
at
the
same
instant
was
bringing
up
the
wounded
montgomery
who
came
to
surrender
his
sword
and
to
beg
quarter
for
his
men
the
earl
turned
deadly
pale
for
the
first
object
that
struck
his
sight
was
the
fierce
knight
of
torthorald
walking
under
the
stream
of
blood
which
continued
to
flow
from
the
ghastly
head
of
cressingham
as
he
held
it
exultingly
in
the
air
if
that
be
your
chief
cried
montgomery
i
have
mistaken
him
much
i
can
not
yield
my
sword
to
him
murray
understood
him
if
cruelty
be
an
evil
spirit
returned
he
it
has
fled
every
breast
in
this
army
to
shelter
with
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
and
its
name
is
legion
that
is
my
chief
added
he
pointing
to
wallace
with
an
evident
consciousness
of
deriving
honor
from
his
command
the
chief
rose
from
the
ground
dyed
in
the
same
ensanguined
hue
which
had
excited
the
abhorrence
of
montgomery
though
it
had
been
drawn
from
his
own
veins
and
those
of
his
horse
all
indeed
of
blood
about
him
seemed
to
be
on
his
garment
none
was
in
his
eyes
none
in
his
heart
but
what
warmed
it
to
mercy
and
to
benevolence
for
all
mankind
his
eyes
momentarily
fell
on
the
approaching
figure
of
kirkpatrick
who
waving
the
head
in
the
air
blew
from
his
bugle
the
triumphal
notes
of
the
pryse
and
then
cried
to
his
chief
i
have
slain
the
wolf
of
scotland
my
brave
clansmen
are
now
casing
my
target
with
his
skin
which
when
i
strike
its
bossy
sides
will
cry
aloud
so
perishes
thy
dishonor
so
perish
all
the
enemies
of
scotland
is
recorded
that
the
memory
of
cressingham
was
so
odious
to
the
scots
they
did
indeed
flay
his
dead
body
and
made
saddles
and
girths
and
other
things
of
his
and
with
the
extinction
of
that
breath
kirkpatrick
cried
wallace
looking
serenely
from
the
head
to
him
let
your
fell
revenge
perish
also
for
your
own
honor
commit
no
indignities
on
the
body
you
have
slain
is
for
you
to
conquer
like
a
god
cried
kirkpatrick
i
have
felt
as
a
man
and
like
a
man
i
revenge
this
head
shall
destroy
in
death
it
shall
vanquish
its
friends
for
me
for
i
will
wear
it
like
a
gorgon
on
my
sword
to
turn
to
stone
every
southron
who
looks
on
it
while
speaking
he
disappeared
amongst
the
thickening
ranks
and
as
the
victorious
scots
hailed
him
in
passing
montgomery
thinking
of
his
perishing
men
suffered
murray
to
lead
him
to
the
scene
of
his
humility
the
eye
of
wallace
perceived
him
as
he
advanced
and
guessing
by
his
armor
and
dignified
demeanor
who
he
was
with
a
noble
grace
he
raised
his
helmed
bonnet
from
his
head
when
the
earl
approached
him
montgomery
looked
on
him
he
felt
his
soul
even
more
than
his
arms
subdued
but
still
there
was
something
about
a
heart
that
shrunk
from
yielding
his
power
of
resistance
the
blood
mounted
into
his
before
pale
cheeks
he
held
out
his
sword
in
silence
to
the
victor
for
he
could
not
bring
his
tongue
to
pronounce
the
word
surrender
wallace
understood
the
sign
and
holding
up
his
hand
to
a
herald
the
trumpet
of
peace
was
raised
it
sounded
and
where
the
moment
before
were
the
horrid
clashing
of
arms
the
yell
of
savage
conquest
and
direful
cries
for
mercy
all
was
hushed
as
death
not
that
death
which
had
passed
but
that
which
is
none
spoke
not
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
low
groans
of
the
dying
who
lay
overwhelmed
and
perishing
beneath
the
bodies
of
the
slain
and
the
feet
of
the
living
the
voice
of
wallace
rose
from
this
awful
pause
its
sound
was
ever
the
harbinger
of
glory
or
of
good
will
to
men
soldiers
cried
he
god
has
given
victory
let
us
show
our
gratitude
by
moderation
and
mercy
gather
the
wounded
into
quarters
and
bury
the
dead
wallace
then
turned
to
the
extended
sword
of
the
earl
he
put
it
gently
back
with
his
hand
ever
wear
what
you
honor
said
he
but
gallant
montgomery
when
you
draw
it
next
let
it
be
in
a
better
cause
learn
brave
earl
to
discriminate
between
a
warrior
glory
and
his
shame
between
the
defender
of
his
country
and
the
unprovoked
ravager
of
other
lands
montgomery
blushed
scarlet
at
these
words
but
it
was
not
with
resentment
he
looked
down
for
a
moment
ah
thought
he
perhaps
i
ought
never
to
have
drawn
it
here
then
raising
his
eyes
to
wallace
he
said
were
you
not
the
enemy
of
my
king
who
though
a
conqueror
sanctions
none
of
the
cruelties
that
have
been
committed
in
his
name
i
would
give
you
my
hand
before
the
remnant
of
his
brave
troops
whose
lives
you
grant
but
you
have
my
heart
a
heart
that
knows
no
difference
between
friend
or
foe
when
the
bonds
of
virtue
would
unite
what
only
civil
dissensions
hold
separate
had
your
king
possessed
the
virtues
you
believe
he
does
replied
wallace
my
sword
might
have
now
been
a
but
that
is
past
we
are
in
arms
for
injuries
received
and
to
drive
out
a
tyrant
for
believe
me
noble
montgomery
that
monarch
has
little
pretensions
to
virtue
who
suffers
the
oppressors
of
his
people
or
of
his
conquests
to
go
unpunished
to
connive
at
cruelty
is
to
practice
it
and
has
edward
ever
frowned
on
one
of
those
despots
who
in
his
name
have
for
these
two
years
past
laid
scotland
in
blood
and
ashes
the
appeal
was
too
strong
for
montgomery
to
answer
he
felt
its
truth
and
bowed
with
an
expression
in
his
face
that
told
more
than
as
a
subject
of
england
he
dared
declare
the
late
respectful
silence
was
turned
into
the
clamorous
activity
of
eager
obedience
the
prisoners
were
conducted
to
the
rear
of
stirling
while
the
major
part
of
the
scots
leaving
a
detachment
to
unburden
the
earth
of
its
bleeding
load
returned
in
front
to
the
gates
just
as
de
warenne
division
appeared
on
the
horizon
like
a
moving
cloud
gilded
by
the
now
setting
sun
at
this
sight
wallace
sent
edwin
into
the
town
with
lord
montgomery
and
marshaling
his
line
prepared
to
bear
down
upon
the
approaching
earl
but
the
lord
warden
had
received
information
which
fought
better
for
the
scots
than
a
host
of
swords
when
advanced
a
very
little
onward
on
the
carse
of
stirling
one
of
his
scouts
brought
intelligence
that
having
approached
the
south
side
of
the
forth
he
had
seen
that
river
floating
with
dead
bodies
and
soon
after
met
southron
horns
blowing
the
notes
of
victory
from
what
he
learned
from
the
fugitives
he
also
informed
his
lord
that
not
only
the
town
and
citadel
of
stirling
were
in
the
possession
of
sir
william
wallace
but
the
two
detachments
under
montgomery
and
hilton
had
both
been
discomfited
and
their
leaders
slain
or
taken
at
this
intelligence
earl
de
warenne
stood
aghast
and
while
he
was
still
doubting
that
such
disgrace
to
king
edward
arms
could
be
possible
two
or
three
fugitives
came
up
and
witnessed
to
its
truth
one
had
seen
kirkpatrick
with
the
bloody
head
of
the
governor
of
stirling
on
his
sword
another
had
been
near
cressingham
in
the
wood
when
he
told
montgomery
of
the
capture
of
de
valence
and
concluding
that
he
meant
the
leader
of
the
third
division
he
corroborated
the
scout
information
of
the
two
defeats
adding
for
terror
magnified
the
objects
of
fear
that
the
scots
army
was
incalculable
but
was
so
disposed
by
sir
william
wallace
as
to
appear
inconsiderable
that
he
might
ensnare
his
enemies
by
filling
them
with
hopes
of
an
easy
conquest
these
accounts
persuaded
de
warenne
to
make
a
retreat
and
intimidated
by
the
exaggerated
representations
of
those
who
had
fled
his
men
with
no
little
precipitation
turned
to
obey
wallace
perceived
the
retrograde
motion
of
his
enemy
lines
and
while
a
stream
of
arrows
from
his
archers
poured
upon
them
like
hail
he
bore
down
upon
the
with
his
cavalry
and
and
sent
graham
round
by
the
wood
to
surprise
the
flanks
all
was
executed
with
promptitude
and
the
tremendous
slogan
sounding
from
side
to
side
the
terrified
southrons
before
in
confusion
now
threw
away
their
arms
to
lighten
themselves
for
escape
sensible
that
it
was
not
the
number
of
the
dead
but
the
terror
of
the
living
which
gives
the
finishing
stroke
to
conquest
de
warenne
saw
the
effects
of
this
panic
in
the
total
disregard
of
his
orders
and
dreadful
would
have
been
the
carnage
of
his
troops
had
he
not
sounded
a
parley
the
bugle
of
wallace
instantly
answered
it
de
warenne
sent
forward
his
herald
he
offered
to
lay
down
his
arms
provided
he
might
be
exempted
from
relinquishing
the
royal
standard
and
that
he
and
his
men
might
be
permitted
to
return
without
delay
to
england
wallace
accepted
the
first
article
granted
the
second
but
with
regard
to
the
third
it
must
be
on
condition
that
he
the
lord
de
warenne
and
the
officers
taken
in
his
army
or
in
other
engagements
lately
fought
in
scotland
should
be
immediately
exchanged
for
the
like
number
of
noble
scots
wallace
should
name
who
were
prisoners
in
england
and
that
the
common
men
of
the
army
now
about
to
surrender
their
arms
should
take
an
oath
never
to
serve
again
against
scotland
these
preliminaries
being
agreed
to
their
very
boldness
arguing
the
conscious
advantage
which
seemed
to
compel
the
assent
the
lord
warden
advanced
at
the
head
of
his
thirty
thousand
troops
and
first
laying
down
his
sword
which
wallace
immediately
returned
to
him
the
officers
and
soldiers
marched
by
with
their
heads
uncovered
throwing
down
their
weapons
as
they
approached
their
conqueror
wallace
extended
his
line
while
the
procession
moved
for
he
had
too
much
policy
to
show
his
enemies
that
thirty
thousand
men
had
yielded
almost
without
a
blow
to
scarce
five
thousand
the
oath
was
afterward
administered
to
each
regiment
by
heralds
sent
for
that
purpose
into
the
strath
of
monteith
whither
wallace
had
directed
the
captured
legions
to
assemble
and
refresh
themselves
previous
to
their
departure
next
morning
for
england
the
privates
thus
disposed
of
to
release
himself
from
the
commanders
also
wallace
told
de
warenne
that
duty
called
him
away
but
every
respect
would
be
paid
to
them
by
the
scottish
officers
he
then
gave
directions
to
sir
alexander
ramsay
to
escort
de
warenne
and
the
rest
of
the
noble
prisoners
to
stirling
wallace
himself
turned
with
his
veteran
band
to
give
a
conqueror
greeting
to
the
baron
of
hilton
and
so
ended
the
famous
battles
of
and
the
carse
of
stirling
chapter
xxxiv
stirling
castle
the
prisoners
who
had
been
taken
with
montgomery
were
lodged
behind
the
town
and
the
wounded
carried
into
the
abbey
of
but
when
edwin
came
to
move
that
earl
himself
he
found
him
too
faint
with
loss
of
blood
to
sit
a
horse
to
snawdoun
he
therefore
ordered
a
litter
and
so
conveyed
his
brave
prisoner
to
that
palace
of
the
kings
of
scotland
in
stirling
the
priests
in
wallace
army
not
only
exercised
the
levitical
but
the
good
samaritan
functions
and
they
soon
obeyed
the
young
summons
to
dress
the
wounds
of
montgomery
messengers
meanwhile
arrived
from
wallace
acquainting
his
chieftains
in
stirling
with
the
surrender
of
de
warenne
army
hence
no
surprise
was
created
in
the
breast
of
the
wounded
earl
when
he
saw
his
commander
enter
the
palace
as
the
prisoner
of
the
illustrious
scot
montgomery
held
out
his
hand
to
the
lord
warden
in
silence
and
with
a
flushed
cheek
blush
not
my
noble
friend
cried
de
warenne
these
wounds
speak
more
eloquently
than
a
thousand
tongues
the
gallantry
with
which
you
maintained
the
sword
that
fate
compelled
you
to
surrender
but
i
without
a
scratch
how
can
i
meet
the
unconquered
edward
and
yet
it
was
not
for
myself
i
feared
my
brave
and
confiding
soldiers
were
in
all
my
thoughts
for
i
saw
it
was
not
to
meet
an
army
i
led
them
but
against
a
whirlwind
a
storm
of
war
with
which
no
strength
that
i
commanded
could
contend
while
the
english
generals
thus
conversed
edwin
impatient
heart
yearned
to
be
again
at
the
side
of
wallace
and
gladly
resigning
the
charge
of
his
noble
prisoner
to
sir
alexander
ramsay
as
soon
as
he
observed
a
cessation
in
the
conversation
of
the
two
earls
he
drew
near
montgomery
to
take
his
leave
farewell
till
we
meet
again
said
the
young
earl
pressing
his
hand
you
have
been
a
young
brother
rather
than
an
enemy
to
me
because
returned
edwin
i
follow
the
example
of
my
general
who
would
willingly
be
the
friend
of
all
mankind
warenne
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
who
are
you
who
in
that
stripling
form
utters
gallant
sentiments
which
might
grace
the
maturest
years
with
a
sweet
dignity
edwin
replied
i
am
edwin
ruthven
the
adopted
brother
of
sir
william
wallace
and
the
son
of
him
asked
de
warenne
who
with
sir
william
wallace
was
the
first
to
mount
dumbarton
walls
at
these
words
the
cheeks
of
edwin
were
suffused
with
a
more
animated
bloom
at
the
moment
when
his
courage
was
distinguished
on
the
heights
of
dumbarton
by
the
vowed
friendship
of
wallace
he
had
found
himself
beloved
by
the
bravest
and
most
amiable
of
beings
and
in
his
light
he
felt
both
warmth
and
brightness
but
this
question
of
de
warenne
conveyed
to
him
that
he
had
found
fame
himself
that
he
was
there
publicly
acknowledged
to
be
an
object
not
unworthy
of
being
called
the
brother
of
sir
william
wallace
casting
down
his
eyes
beaming
with
exultation
from
the
fixed
gaze
of
de
warenne
he
answered
i
am
that
happy
ruthven
who
had
the
honor
to
mount
dumbarton
rock
by
the
side
of
my
general
and
from
his
hand
there
received
the
stroke
of
knighthood
de
warenne
rose
much
agitated
if
such
be
the
boys
of
scotland
need
we
wonder
when
the
spirit
of
resistance
is
roused
in
the
nation
that
our
strength
should
wither
before
its
men
at
least
said
montgomery
whose
admiration
of
what
passed
seemed
to
reanimate
his
languid
faculties
it
deprives
defeat
of
its
sting
when
we
are
conscious
we
yielded
to
power
that
was
irresistible
but
my
lord
added
he
if
the
courage
of
this
youth
amazes
you
what
will
you
say
ought
to
be
the
fate
of
this
country
what
to
be
the
crown
of
sir
william
wallace
career
when
you
know
the
chain
of
brave
hearts
by
which
he
is
surrounded
even
tender
woman
loses
the
weakness
of
her
sex
when
she
belongs
to
him
earl
de
warenne
surprised
at
the
energy
with
which
he
spoke
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
that
told
him
so
yes
continued
he
i
witnessed
the
heroism
of
lady
wallace
when
she
defended
the
character
of
her
husband
in
the
midst
of
an
armed
host
and
preserved
the
secret
of
his
retreat
inviolate
i
saw
that
loveliest
of
women
whom
the
dastard
heselrigge
slew
disgrace
to
knighthood
cried
edwin
with
indignant
vehemence
if
you
were
a
spectator
of
that
bloody
deed
retire
from
this
house
go
to
anywhere
but
leave
this
city
before
the
injured
wallace
arrives
blast
not
his
eyes
with
a
second
sight
of
one
who
could
have
beheld
his
wife
murdered
every
eye
was
now
fixed
on
the
commanding
figure
of
the
young
edwin
who
stood
with
the
determination
of
being
obeyed
breathing
in
every
look
de
warenne
then
at
once
saw
the
possibility
of
so
gentle
a
creature
being
transformed
into
the
soul
of
enterprise
into
the
fearless
and
effective
soldier
lord
montgomery
held
out
his
hand
to
edwin
by
this
right
arm
i
swear
noble
youth
that
had
i
been
on
the
spot
when
heselrigge
lifted
his
sword
against
the
breast
of
lady
wallace
i
would
have
sheathed
my
sword
in
his
it
was
before
then
that
i
saw
that
matchless
woman
and
offended
with
my
want
of
severity
in
the
scrutiny
i
had
made
at
ellerslie
for
its
chief
heselrigge
sent
me
back
to
ayr
arnuf
quarreled
with
me
there
on
the
same
subject
and
i
immediately
retired
in
disgust
to
england
then
how
you
ought
to
be
sir
gilbert
hambledon
replied
edwin
but
whoever
you
are
as
you
were
kind
to
the
lady
marion
i
can
not
but
regret
my
late
hasty
charge
and
for
which
i
beseech
your
pardon
montgomery
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
generous
ruthven
your
warmth
is
too
honorable
to
need
forgiveness
i
am
that
sir
gilbert
hambledon
and
had
i
remained
so
i
should
not
now
be
in
scotland
but
in
my
first
interview
with
the
prince
of
wales
after
my
accession
to
the
earldom
of
montgomery
his
highness
told
me
it
had
been
rumored
from
scotland
that
i
was
disloyal
in
my
heart
to
my
king
to
prove
the
falsehood
of
such
calumniators
continued
the
prince
appoint
you
second
in
command
there
to
the
earl
de
warenne
to
have
refused
to
fight
against
sir
william
wallace
would
have
been
to
have
accused
myself
of
treason
and
while
i
respected
the
husband
of
the
murdered
lady
marion
i
yet
condemned
him
as
an
insurgent
and
with
the
same
spirit
you
follow
him
in
the
field
i
obeyed
the
commands
of
my
sovereign
lord
montgomery
returned
edwin
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
one
who
proves
to
me
what
my
general
wronged
as
he
has
been
yet
always
inculcates
that
all
the
southrons
are
not
base
and
cruel
when
he
knows
who
is
indeed
his
prisoner
what
recollections
will
it
awaken
but
till
you
and
he
again
meet
i
shall
not
intimate
to
him
the
melancholy
satisfaction
he
is
to
enjoy
for
with
the
remembrances
it
will
arouse
your
presence
must
bring
the
antidote
the
brave
youth
then
telling
ramsay
in
what
parts
of
the
palace
the
rest
of
the
lords
were
to
be
lodged
with
recovered
composure
descended
to
the
courtyard
to
take
horse
for
tor
wood
he
was
galloping
along
under
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
when
he
heard
a
squadron
on
full
speed
approaching
and
presently
murray
appeared
at
its
head
hurrah
edwin
cried
he
well
met
we
are
come
to
demand
the
instant
surrender
of
the
citadel
hilton
division
has
surrendered
the
two
barons
had
indeed
come
up
about
half
an
hour
after
earl
de
warenne
division
was
discomfited
sir
william
wallace
had
sent
forward
to
the
advancing
enemy
two
heralds
bearing
the
colors
de
valence
and
montgomery
with
the
captive
banner
of
de
warenne
and
requiring
the
present
division
to
lay
down
its
army
also
the
sight
of
these
standards
was
sufficient
to
assure
hilton
there
was
no
deceit
in
the
embassy
the
nature
of
his
position
precluded
retreat
and
not
seeing
any
reason
for
ten
thousand
men
disputing
the
day
with
a
power
to
whom
fifty
thousand
had
just
surrendered
he
and
his
compeer
with
the
reluctance
of
veterans
embraced
the
terms
of
surrender
the
instant
hilton
put
his
argent
into
the
victor
hand
wallace
knew
that
the
castle
must
now
be
his
he
had
discomfited
all
who
could
have
maintained
it
against
him
impatient
to
apprise
lord
mar
and
his
family
of
their
safety
he
dispatched
murray
with
a
considerable
escort
to
demand
its
surrender

the

of
the
patrimonial
castles
of
these
two
ancient
barons
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
north
of
england
the
revered
mother
was
a
descendant
from
the
latter
venerable
name
united
with
that
of
the
brave
and
erudite
race
of
adamson
of
further
north
murray
gladly
obeyed
and
now
accompanied
by
edwin
with
the
standards
of
cressingham
and
de
warenne
trailing
in
the
dust
he
arrived
before
the
castle
and
summoned
the
lieutenant
to
the
walls
but
that
officer
well
aware
of
what
was
going
to
happen
feared
to
appear
from
the
battlements
of
the
keep
he
had
seen
the
dreadful
conflict
on
the
banks
of
the
forth
he
had
seen
the
thousands
of
de
warenne
pass
before
the
conqueror
to
punish
his
treachery
in
not
only
having
suffered
cressingham
to
steal
out
under
the
armistice
but
upholding
also
the
breaking
of
his
word
to
surrender
at
sunset
the
terrified
officer
believed
that
wallace
was
now
come
to
put
the
whole
garrison
to
the
sword
at
the
first
sight
of
murray
approaching
squadron
the
lieutenant
hurried
to
lord
mar
to
offer
him
immediate
liberty
if
he
would
go
forth
to
wallace
and
treat
with
him
to
spare
the
lives
of
the
garrison
closed
up
in
a
solitary
dungeon
the
earl
knew
naught
of
what
was
occurring
without
and
when
the
southron
entered
he
expected
it
was
to
lead
him
again
to
the
death
which
had
been
twice
averted
but
the
pale
and
trembling
lieutenant
had
no
sooner
spoken
the
first
word
than
mar
discerned
it
was
a
suppliant
not
an
executioner
he
saw
before
him
and
he
was
even
promising
that
clemency
from
wallace
which
he
knew
dwelt
in
his
heart
when
murray
trumpet
sounded
the
lieutenant
started
it
is
now
too
late
we
have
not
made
the
first
overture
and
there
sounds
the
of
this
garrison
i
saved
your
life
earl
cried
he
imploringly
to
lord
mar
when
the
enraged
cressingham
commanded
me
to
pull
the
cord
which
would
have
launched
you
into
eternity
i
disobeyed
him
for
my
sake
then
preserve
this
garrison
and
accompany
me
to
the
ramparts
the
chains
were
immediately
knocked
off
the
limbs
of
lord
mar
and
the
lieutenant
presenting
him
with
a
sword
they
appeared
together
on
the
battlements
as
the
declining
moon
shone
on
their
backs
murray
did
not
discern
that
it
was
his
uncle
who
mounted
the
walls
but
calling
to
him
in
a
voice
which
declared
there
was
no
appeal
pointed
to
the
humbled
colors
of
edward
and
demanded
the
instant
surrender
of
the
citadel
let
it
be
then
with
the
pledge
of
sir
william
wallace
mercy
cried
the
venerable
earl
with
every
pledge
lord
mar
returned
murray
now
joyfully
recognizing
his
uncle
which
you
think
safe
to
give
then
the
keys
of
the
citadel
are
yours
cried
the
lieutenant
i
only
ask
the
lives
of
my
garrison
this
was
granted
and
immediately
preparations
were
made
for
the
admission
of
the
scots
as
the
enraptured
edwin
heard
the
heavy
chains
of
the
portcullis
drawn
up
and
the
massy
bolts
of
the
huge
doors
grating
in
their
guards
he
thought
of
his
mother
liberty
of
his
father
joy
in
pressing
her
again
in
his
arms
and
hastening
to
the
tower
where
lord
ruthven
held
watch
over
the
now
sleeping
de
valance
he
told
him
all
that
had
happened
go
my
father
added
he
enter
with
murray
and
be
the
first
to
open
the
prison
doors
of
my
mother
lord
ruthven
embraced
his
son
my
dear
edwin
this
sacrifice
to
my
feelings
is
worthy
of
you
but
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
superior
even
to
the
tenderest
private
ones
i
am
planted
hereby
my
commander
and
shall
i
quit
my
station
for
any
gratification
till
he
gives
me
leave
no
my
son
be
you
my
representative
to
your
mother
and
while
my
example
teaches
you
above
all
earthly
considerations
to
obey
your
honor
those
tender
embraces
will
show
her
what
i
sacrifice
to
duty
edwin
no
longer
urged
his
father
and
leaving
his
apartment
flew
to
the
gate
of
the
inner
ballium
it
was
open
and
murray
already
stood
on
the
platform
before
the
keep
receiving
the
keys
to
the
garrison
blessed
sight
cried
the
earl
to
his
nephew
when
i
put
the
banner
of
mar
into
your
unpracticed
hand
little
could
i
expect
that
in
the
course
of
four
months
i
should
see
my
brave
andrew
receive
the
keys
of
proud
stirling
from
its
commander
murray
smiled
while
his
plumed
head
bowed
gratefully
to
his
uncle
and
turning
to
the
lieutenant
now
said
he
lead
me
to
the
ladies
mar
and
ruthven
that
i
may
assure
them
they
are
free
the
gates
of
the
keep
were
now
unclosed
and
the
lieutenant
conducted
his
victors
along
a
gloomy
passage
to
a
low
door
studded
with
knobs
of
iron
as
he
drew
the
bolt
he
whispered
to
lord
mar
these
severities
are
the
hard
policy
of
governor
cressingham
he
pushed
the
door
slowly
open
and
discovered
a
small
miserable
cell
its
walls
of
rugged
stone
having
no
other
covering
than
the
incrustations
which
time
and
many
a
dripping
winter
had
strewn
over
their
vaulted
service
on
the
ground
on
a
pallet
of
straw
lay
a
female
figure
in
a
profound
sleep
but
the
light
which
the
lieutenant
held
streaming
full
upon
the
uncurtained
slumberer
she
started
and
with
a
shriek
of
terror
at
the
sight
of
so
many
armed
men
discovered
the
pallid
features
of
the
countess
of
mar
with
an
anguish
which
hardly
the
freedom
he
was
going
to
bestow
could
ameliorate
the
earl
rushed
forward
and
throwing
himself
beside
her
caught
her
in
his
arms
are
we
then
to
die
cried
she
in
a
voice
of
horror
has
wallace
abandoned
us
are
we
to
perish
man
overcome
by
his
emotions
the
earl
could
only
strain
her
to
his
breast
in
speechless
agitation
edwin
saw
a
picture
of
his
sufferings
in
the
present
distraction
of
the
countess
and
he
felt
his
powers
of
utterance
locked
up
but
lord
andrew
whose
heart
was
gay
the
moment
he
was
no
longer
unhappy
jocosely
answered
my
fair
aunt
there
are
many
hearts
to
die
by
your
eyes
before
that
day
and
meanwhile
i
come
from
sir
william
wallace
to
set
you
free
the
name
of
wallace
and
the
intimation
that
he
had
sent
to
set
her
free
drove
every
former
thought
of
death
and
misery
from
her
mind
again
the
ambrosial
gales
of
love
seemed
to
breathe
around
her
she
saw
not
her
prison
walls
she
felt
herself
again
in
his
presence
and
in
a
blissful
trance
rather
endured
than
participated
in
the
warm
congratulations
of
her
husband
on
their
mutual
safety
edwin
and
murray
turned
to
follow
the
lieutenant
who
preceding
them
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
here
said
he
is
lady
habitation
and
alas
not
better
than
the
countess
while
he
spoke
he
threw
open
the
door
and
discovered
its
sad
inmate
also
asleep
but
when
the
glad
voice
of
her
son
pierced
her
ear
when
his
fond
embraces
clung
to
her
bosom
her
surprise
and
emotions
were
almost
insupportable
hardly
crediting
her
senses
that
he
whom
she
had
believed
was
safe
in
the
cloisters
of
colomba
could
be
within
the
dangerous
walls
of
stirling
that
it
was
his
mailed
breast
that
pressed
against
her
bosom
that
it
was
his
voice
she
heard
exclaiming
mother
we
come
to
give
you
freedom
all
appeared
to
her
like
a
dream
of
madness
she
listened
she
felt
him
she
found
her
cheek
wet
with
his
rapturous
tears
am
i
in
my
right
mind
cried
she
looking
at
him
with
a
fearful
yet
overjoyed
countenance
am
i
not
mad
oh
tell
me
cried
she
turning
to
murray
and
the
lieutenant
is
this
my
son
that
i
see
or
has
terror
turned
my
brain
it
is
indeed
your
son
your
edwin
my
very
self
returned
he
alarmed
at
the
expression
of
her
voice
and
countenance
murray
gently
advanced
and
kneeling
down
by
her
respectfully
took
her
hand
he
speaks
truth
my
dear
madam
it
is
your
son
edwin
he
left
his
convent
to
be
a
volunteer
with
sir
william
wallace
he
has
covered
himself
with
honor
on
the
walls
of
dumbarton
and
here
also
a
sharer
in
his
leader
victories
he
is
come
to
set
you
free
at
this
explanation
which
being
given
in
the
sober
language
of
reason
lady
ruthven
believed
she
gave
way
to
the
full
happiness
of
her
soul
and
falling
on
the
neck
of
her
son
embraced
him
with
a
flood
of
tears
and
thy
father
edwin
where
is
he
did
not
the
noble
wallace
rescue
him
from
ayr
he
did
and
he
is
here
edwin
then
repeated
to
his
mother
the
affectionate
message
of
his
father
and
the
particulars
of
his
release
perceiving
how
happily
they
were
engaged
murray
now
with
a
flutter
in
his
own
bosom
rose
from
his
knees
and
requested
the
lieutenant
to
conduct
him
to
lady
helen
mar
his
guide
led
the
way
by
a
winding
staircase
into
a
stone
gallery
where
letting
lord
andrew
into
a
spacious
apartment
divided
in
the
midst
by
a
vast
screen
of
carved
he
pointed
to
a
curtained
entrance
in
that
chamber
said
he
lodges
the
lady
helen
ah
my
poor
cousin
exclaimed
murray
though
she
seems
not
to
have
tasted
the
hardships
of
her
parents
she
has
shared
their
misery
i
do
not
doubt
while
he
spoke
the
lieutenant
bowed
in
silence
and
murray
entered
alone
the
chamber
was
magnificent
and
illumined
by
a
lamp
which
hung
from
the
ceiling
he
cautiously
approached
the
bed
fearing
too
hastily
to
disturb
her
and
gently
pulling
aside
the
curtains
beheld
vacancy
an
exclamation
of
alarm
had
almost
escaped
him
when
observing
a
door
at
the
other
side
of
the
apartment
he
drew
toward
it
and
there
beheld
his
cousin
with
her
back
to
him
kneeling
before
a
crucifix
she
spoke
not
but
the
fervor
of
her
action
manifested
how
earnestly
she
prayed
he
moved
behind
her
but
she
heard
him
not
her
whole
soul
was
absorbed
in
the
success
of
her
petition
and
at
last
raising
her
clasped
hands
in
a
paroxysm
of
emotion
she
exclaimed
if
that
trumpet
sounded
the
victory
of
the
scots
then
power
of
goodness
receive
thy
servant
thanks
but
if
de
warenne
have
conquered
where
de
valence
has
failed
if
all
whom
i
love
be
lost
to
me
here
take
me
then
to
thyself
and
let
my
freed
spirit
fly
to
their
embraces
in
heaven
ay
and
on
earth
too
thou
blessed
angel
cried
murray
throwing
himself
toward
her
she
started
from
her
knees
and
with
such
a
cry
as
the
widow
of
sarepta
uttered
when
she
embraced
her
son
from
the
dead
helen
threw
herself
on
the
bosom
of
her
cousin
and
closed
her
eyes
in
a
blissful
swoon
for
even
while
every
outward
sense
seemed
fled
the
impression
of
joy
played
about
her
heart
and
the
animated
throbbings
of
murray
breast
while
he
pressed
her
in
his
arms
at
last
aroused
her
to
recollection
her
glistening
and
uplifted
eyes
told
all
the
happiness
all
the
gratitude
of
her
soul
my
father
all
are
safe
demanded
she
all
my
best
beloved
answered
murray
forgetting
in
his
powerful
emotions
of
his
heart
that
what
he
felt
and
what
he
uttered
were
beyond
even
a
cousin
limits
my
uncle
the
countess
lord
and
lady
ruthven
all
are
safe
and
sir
william
wallace
cried
she
you
do
not
mention
him
i
hope
no
he
is
conqueror
here
interrupted
murray
he
has
subdued
every
obstacle
between
berwick
and
stirling
and
he
has
sent
me
hither
to
set
you
and
the
rest
of
the
dear
prisoners
free
helen
heart
throbbed
with
a
new
tumult
as
he
spoke
she
longed
to
ask
whether
the
unknown
knight
from
whom
she
had
parted
in
the
cell
had
ever
joined
sir
william
wallace
she
yearned
to
know
that
he
yet
lived
at
the
thought
of
the
probability
of
his
having
fallen
in
some
of
these
desperate
conflicts
her
soul
seemed
to
gasp
for
existence
and
dropping
her
head
on
her
cousin
shoulder
tell
me
andrew
said
she
and
there
she
paused
with
an
emotion
for
which
she
could
not
account
to
herself
of
what
would
my
sweet
cousin
inquire
asked
murray
partaking
her
agitation
nothing
particular
said
she
covered
with
blushes
but
did
you
fight
alone
in
these
battles
did
no
other
knight
but
sir
william
wallace
many
dearest
helen
returned
murray
enraptured
at
a
solicitude
which
he
appropriated
to
himself
many
knights
joined
our
arms
all
fought
in
a
manner
worthy
of
their
leader
and
thanks
to
heaven
none
have
fallen
thanks
indeed
cried
helen
and
with
a
hope
she
dared
hardly
whisper
to
herself
of
seeing
the
unknown
knight
in
the
gallant
train
of
the
conqueror
she
falteringly
said
now
andrew
lead
me
to
my
father
murray
would
perhaps
have
required
a
second
bidding
had
not
lord
mar
impatient
to
see
his
daughter
appeared
with
the
countess
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
hastening
toward
them
she
fell
on
the
bosom
of
her
father
and
while
she
bathed
his
face
and
hands
with
her
glad
tears
he
too
wept
and
mingled
blessings
with
his
caresses
no
coldness
here
met
his
paternal
heart
no
distracting
confusions
tore
her
from
his
arms
no
averted
looks
by
turns
alarmed
and
chilled
the
bosom
of
tenderness
all
was
innocence
and
duty
in
helen
breast
and
every
ingenuous
action
showed
its
affection
and
its
joy
the
estranged
heart
of
lady
mar
had
closed
against
him
and
though
he
suspected
not
its
wanderings
he
felt
the
unutterable
difference
between
the
warm
transports
of
his
daughter
and
the
frigid
gratulations
forced
from
the
lips
of
his
wife
lady
mar
gazed
with
a
weird
frown
on
the
lovely
form
of
helen
as
she
wound
her
exquisitely
turned
arms
round
the
earl
in
filial
tenderness
her
bosom
heaving
in
the
snowy
whiteness
of
virgin
purity
her
face
radiant
with
the
softest
blooms
of
youth
all
seemed
to
frame
an
object
which
malignant
fiends
had
conjured
up
to
blast
her
stepdame
hope
wallace
will
behold
these
charms
cried
her
distracted
spirit
to
herself
and
then
where
am
i
while
her
thoughts
thus
followed
each
other
she
unconsciously
darted
looks
on
helen
which
if
an
evil
eye
had
any
bewitching
power
would
have
withered
all
her
beauties
at
one
of
these
portentous
moments
the
glad
eyes
of
helen
met
her
glance
she
started
with
horror
it
made
her
remember
how
she
had
been
betrayed
and
all
that
she
had
suffered
from
soulis
but
she
could
not
forget
that
she
had
also
been
rescued
and
with
that
blessed
recollection
the
image
of
her
preserver
rose
before
her
at
this
gentle
idea
her
alarmed
countenance
took
a
softer
expression
and
tenderly
sighing
she
turned
to
her
question
of
how
she
came
to
be
with
lady
ruthven
when
he
had
been
taught
by
lord
andrew
to
believe
her
safe
at
st
fillan
yes
cried
murray
throwing
herself
on
a
seat
beside
her
i
found
in
your
letter
to
sir
william
wallace
that
you
had
been
betrayed
from
your
asylum
by
some
traitor
scot
and
but
for
the
fullness
of
my
joy
at
our
present
meeting
i
should
have
inquired
the
name
of
the
villian
lady
mar
felt
a
deadly
sickness
at
her
heart
on
hearing
that
sir
william
wallace
was
already
so
far
acquainted
with
her
daughter
as
to
have
received
a
letter
from
her
and
in
amazed
despair
she
prepared
to
listen
to
what
she
expected
would
bring
a
to
her
hopes
they
had
met
but
how
where
they
wrote
to
each
other
then
far
indeed
had
proceeded
that
communication
of
hearts
which
was
now
the
aim
of
her
life
and
she
was
undone
helen
glanced
at
the
face
of
lady
mar
and
observing
its
changes
regarded
them
as
corroborations
of
her
having
been
the
betrayer
if
conscience
disturbs
you
thus
thought
helen
let
it
rend
your
heart
and
perhaps
remorse
may
follow
as
the
tide
of
success
seemed
so
full
for
the
patriot
scots
helen
no
longer
feared
that
her
cousin
would
rashly
seek
a
precarious
vengeance
on
the
traitor
soulis
when
he
might
probably
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
making
it
certain
at
the
head
of
an
army
she
therefore
commenced
her
narrative
from
the
time
of
murray
leaving
her
at
the
priory
and
continued
it
to
the
hour
in
which
she
had
met
her
father
a
prisoner
in
the
streets
of
stirling
as
she
proceeded
the
indignation
of
the
earl
and
of
murray
against
soulis
became
vehement
the
nephew
was
full
of
immediate
personal
revenge
but
the
father
with
arguments
similar
to
those
which
had
suggested
themselves
to
his
daughter
calmed
the
lover
rage
for
murray
now
felt
that
fire
as
well
as
a
kinsman
and
reseated
himself
with
repressed
though
burning
resentment
to
listen
to
the
remainder
of
her
relation
the
quaking
conscience
of
lady
mar
did
indeed
vary
her
cheeks
with
a
thousand
dyes
when
as
helen
repeated
part
of
her
conversation
with
macgregor
wife
murray
abruptly
said
surely
that
woman
could
name
the
traitor
who
betrayed
us
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
did
she
not
hint
it
helen
cast
down
her
eyes
that
even
a
glance
might
not
overwhelm
with
insupportable
shame
the
already
trembling
countess
lady
mar
saw
that
she
was
acquainted
with
her
guilt
and
expecting
no
more
mercy
than
she
knew
she
would
show
to
helen
in
the
like
circumstances
she
hastily
rose
from
her
chair
internally
vowing
vengeance
against
her
triumphant
daughter
and
hatred
of
all
mankind
but
helen
thought
she
might
have
so
erred
from
a
wife
alarm
for
the
safety
of
the
husband
she
professed
to
doat
on
and
this
dutiful
daughter
determined
never
to
accuse
her
while
all
the
furies
raged
in
the
breast
of
the
guilty
woman
helen
simply
answered
lord
soulis
would
be
weak
as
he
is
vile
to
trust
a
secret
of
that
kind
with
a
servant
then
hurried
on
to
the
relation
of
subsequent
events
the
countess
breathed
again
and
almost
deceiving
herself
with
the
idea
that
helen
was
indeed
ignorant
of
her
treachery
listened
with
emotions
of
another
kind
when
she
heard
of
the
rescue
of
her
she
saw
wallace
in
that
brave
act
but
as
helen
undesignedly
to
herself
passed
over
the
parts
in
their
conversation
which
had
most
interested
her
and
never
named
the
graces
of
his
person
lady
mar
thought
that
to
have
viewed
wallace
with
so
little
notice
would
have
been
impossible
and
therefore
was
glad
of
such
a
double
conviction
that
he
and
her
daughter
had
never
met
which
seemed
verified
when
helen
said
that
the
unknown
chief
had
promised
to
join
his
arms
with
those
of
wallace
murray
had
observed
helen
while
she
spoke
with
an
impression
at
his
heart
that
made
it
pause
something
in
this
interview
had
whispered
to
him
what
he
had
never
dreamed
before
that
she
was
dearer
to
him
than
fifty
thousand
cousins
and
while
the
blood
flushed
and
retreated
in
the
complexion
of
helen
and
her
downcast
eyes
refused
to
show
what
was
passing
there
while
she
hastily
ran
over
the
circumstances
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
stranger
knight
murray
own
emotions
declared
the
secret
of
hers
and
with
a
lip
as
pale
as
her
own
he
said
but
where
is
this
brave
man
he
can
not
have
yet
joined
us
for
surely
he
would
have
told
wallace
or
myself
that
he
came
from
you
i
warned
him
not
to
do
so
replied
she
for
fear
that
your
indignation
against
my
enemies
my
dear
cousin
might
have
precipitated
you
into
dangers
to
be
incurred
for
our
country
only
then
if
he
had
joined
us
replied
murray
rising
from
his
seat
you
will
probably
soon
known
who
he
is
morning
sir
william
wallace
will
enter
the
citadel
attended
by
his
principal
knights
and
in
that
gallant
company
you
must
doubtless
discover
the
man
who
had
laid
such
obligations
on
us
all
by
your
preservation
murray
feelings
told
him
that
glad
should
he
be
if
the
utterance
of
that
obligation
would
repay
it
helen
herself
knew
not
how
to
account
for
the
agitation
which
shook
her
whenever
she
adverted
to
her
unknown
preserver
at
the
time
of
the
hermit
friend
the
good
lay
brother
having
brought
her
to
alloa
when
she
explained
to
lady
ruthven
the
cause
of
her
strange
arrival
she
had
then
told
her
story
with
composure
till
she
mentioned
her
deliverer
but
in
that
moment
for
the
first
time
she
felt
a
confusion
which
disordered
the
animation
with
which
she
described
his
patriotism
and
his
bravery
but
it
was
natural
she
thought
that
gratitude
for
a
recent
benefit
should
make
her
heart
beat
high
it
was
something
like
the
enthusiasm
she
had
felt
for
wallace
on
the
rescue
of
her
father
and
she
was
satisfied
but
a
few
days
of
quiet
at
alloa
had
recovered
her
health
from
the
shock
it
had
received
in
the
recent
scenes
and
she
proposed
to
her
aunt
to
send
some
trusty
messenger
to
inform
the
imprisoned
earl
at
dumbarton
of
her
happy
refuge
and
lady
ruthven
in
return
had
urged
the
probability
that
the
messenger
would
be
intercepted
and
so
her
asylum
be
discovered
saying
let
it
alone
till
this
knight
of
yours
by
performing
his
word
calls
you
to
declare
his
honorable
deeds
till
then
lord
mar
ignorant
of
your
danger
needs
no
assurance
of
your
safety
this
casual
reference
to
the
knight
had
then
made
the
tranquilized
heart
of
helen
renew
its
throbbings
and
turning
from
her
aunt
with
an
acquiescing
reply
she
retired
to
her
own
apartment
to
quell
the
unusual
and
painful
blushes
she
felt
burning
on
her
cheeks
why
she
should
feel
thus
she
could
not
account
unless
said
she
to
herself
i
fear
that
my
suspicion
may
be
guessed
at
and
should
my
words
or
looks
betray
the
royal
bruce
to
any
harm
that
moment
of
undesigned
ingratitude
would
be
the
last
of
my
life
this
explanation
seemed
ample
to
herself
and
henceforth
avoiding
all
mention
of
her
preserver
in
her
conversations
with
lady
ruthven
she
had
confined
the
subject
to
her
own
breast
and
thinking
that
she
thought
of
him
more
by
her
intention
to
speak
of
him
less
she
wondered
not
that
whenever
she
was
alone
his
image
immediately
rose
in
her
mind
his
voice
seemed
to
sound
in
her
ears
and
even
as
the
summer
air
wafted
its
soft
fragrance
over
her
cheek
she
would
turn
as
if
she
felt
that
breath
which
had
so
gently
brushed
her
to
repose
she
would
then
start
and
sigh
and
repeat
his
words
to
herself
but
all
was
serene
in
her
bosom
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
contemplation
of
so
much
loveliness
of
soul
in
so
noble
a
form
soothed
instead
of
agitated
her
heart
what
a
king
will
he
be
thought
she
with
what
transport
would
the
virtuous
wallace
set
the
scottish
crown
on
so
noble
a
brow
such
were
her
meditations
and
feelings
when
she
was
brought
a
prisoner
to
stirling
and
when
she
heard
of
the
victories
of
wallace
she
could
not
but
think
that
the
brave
arm
of
her
knight
was
there
and
that
he
with
the
renowned
champion
of
scotland
would
fly
on
the
receipt
of
her
letter
to
stirling
there
to
repeat
the
valiant
deeds
of
dumbarton
the
first
blast
of
the
scottish
trumpet
under
the
walls
found
her
as
she
had
said
upon
her
knees
and
kept
her
there
for
hardly
with
any
intermission
with
fast
and
prayer
did
she
kneel
before
the
altar
of
heaven
till
the
voice
of
andrew
murray
at
midnight
called
her
to
freedom
and
to
happiness
wallace
and
perhaps
her
nameless
hero
with
him
had
again
conquered
his
idea
dwelt
in
her
heart
and
faltered
on
her
tongue
and
yet
in
reciting
the
narrative
of
her
late
sufferings
to
her
father
when
she
came
to
the
mentioning
of
the
stranger
conduct
to
her
with
an
apprehensive
embarrassment
she
felt
her
growing
emotions
as
she
drew
near
the
subject
and
hurrying
over
the
event
she
could
only
excuse
herself
for
such
new
perturbations
by
supposing
that
the
former
treason
of
lady
mar
now
excited
her
alarm
with
fear
she
should
fix
it
on
a
new
object
turning
cold
at
an
idea
so
pregnant
with
horror
she
hastily
passed
from
the
agitating
theme
to
speak
of
de
valence
and
the
respect
with
which
he
had
treated
her
during
her
imprisonment
his
courtesy
had
professed
to
deny
nothing
to
her
wishes
except
her
personal
liberty
and
any
conference
with
her
parents
or
aunt
her
father
life
he
declared
it
was
altogether
out
of
his
power
to
grant
he
might
suspend
the
sentence
but
he
could
not
abrogate
it
yes
cried
the
earl
though
false
and
inflexible
i
must
not
accuse
him
of
having
been
so
barbarous
in
his
tyranny
as
cressingham
for
it
was
not
until
de
valence
was
taken
prisoner
that
joanna
and
i
were
divided
till
then
we
were
lodged
in
decent
apartments
but
on
that
event
cressingham
tore
us
from
each
other
and
threw
us
into
different
dungeons
my
sister
janet
i
never
saw
since
the
hour
we
were
separated
in
the
street
of
stirling
until
the
awful
moment
in
which
we
met
on
the
roof
of
this
castle
the
moment
when
i
expected
to
behold
her
and
my
wife
die
before
my
eyes
helen
now
learned
for
the
first
time
the
base
cruelties
which
had
been
exercised
on
her
father
and
his
family
since
the
capture
of
de
valence
she
had
been
exempted
from
sharing
them
by
the
fears
of
cressingham
who
knowing
that
the
english
earl
had
particular
views
with
regard
to
her
durst
not
risk
offending
him
by
outraging
one
whom
he
had
declared
himself
determined
to
protect
during
part
of
this
conversation
murray
withdrew
to
bring
lady
ruthven
and
her
son
to
share
the
general
joy
of
full
domestic
reunion
the
happy
edwin
and
his
mother
having
embraced
these
dear
relatives
with
yet
more
tender
affections
yearning
in
their
bosoms
accompanied
murray
to
the
door
of
the
barbican
which
contained
lord
ruthven
they
entered
on
the
wings
of
conjugal
and
filial
love
but
the
for
once
pensive
lord
andrew
with
a
slow
and
musing
step
returned
into
the
castle
to
see
that
all
was
safely
disposed
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
chapter
xxxv
stirling
citadel
at
noon
next
day
murray
received
a
message
from
wallace
desiring
him
to
acquaint
the
earl
of
mar
that
he
was
coming
to
the
citadel
to
offer
the
palace
of
snawdoun
to
the
ladies
of
mar
and
to
request
the
earl
to
take
charge
of
the
illustrous
prisoners
he
was
bringing
to
the
castle
each
member
of
the
family
hastened
to
prepare
for
an
interview
which
excited
different
expectations
in
each
different
breast
lady
mar
well
satisfied
that
helen
and
wallace
had
never
met
and
clinging
to
the
vague
words
of
murray
that
he
had
sent
to
give
her
liberty
called
forth
every
art
of
the
tiringroom
to
embellish
her
still
fine
person
lady
ruthven
with
the
respectable
eagerness
of
a
chaste
matron
in
prospect
of
seeing
the
man
who
had
so
often
been
the
preserver
of
her
brother
and
who
had
so
lately
delivered
her
husband
from
a
loathsome
dungeon
was
the
first
who
joined
the
earl
in
the
great
gallery
lady
mar
soon
after
entered
like
juno
in
all
her
plumage
of
majesty
and
beauty
but
the
trumpet
of
wallace
had
sounded
in
the
gates
before
the
trembling
helen
could
leave
her
apartment
it
was
the
herald
of
his
approach
and
she
sunk
breathless
into
a
seat
she
was
now
going
to
see
for
the
first
time
the
man
for
whose
woes
she
had
so
often
wept
the
man
who
had
incurred
them
all
for
objects
dear
to
her
he
whom
she
had
mourned
as
one
stricken
in
sorrows
and
feared
for
as
an
outlaw
doomed
to
suffering
and
to
death
was
now
to
appear
before
her
not
in
the
garb
of
woe
which
excuses
the
sympathy
its
wearer
excites
but
arrayed
as
a
conqueror
as
the
champion
of
scotland
giving
laws
to
her
oppressors
and
entering
in
triumph
over
fields
of
their
slain
awful
as
this
picture
was
to
the
timidity
of
her
gentle
nature
it
alone
did
not
occasion
that
inexpressible
sensation
which
seemed
to
check
the
pulses
of
her
heart
was
she
or
was
she
not
to
recognize
in
his
train
the
young
and
noble
bruce
was
she
to
be
assured
that
he
still
existed
or
by
seeking
him
everywhere
in
vain
ascertain
that
he
who
could
not
break
his
word
had
perished
lonely
and
unknown
while
these
ideas
thronged
into
her
mind
the
platform
below
was
filling
with
the
triumphant
scots
and
her
door
suddenly
opening
edwin
entered
in
delighted
haste
come
cousin
cried
he
sir
william
wallace
has
almost
finished
his
business
in
the
great
hall
he
has
made
my
uncle
governor
of
this
place
and
has
committed
nearly
a
thousand
prisoners
of
rank
to
his
care
if
you
be
not
expeditious
you
will
allow
him
to
enter
the
gallery
before
you
hardly
observing
her
face
from
the
happy
emotions
which
dazzled
his
own
eyes
he
seized
her
hand
and
hurried
her
to
the
gallery
only
her
aunt
and
were
yet
there
lady
ruthven
sat
composedly
on
a
tapestried
bench
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
company
but
lady
mar
was
near
the
door
listening
impatiently
to
the
voices
beneath
at
sight
of
helen
she
drew
back
but
she
smiled
exultingly
when
she
saw
that
all
the
splendour
of
beauty
she
had
so
lately
beheld
and
dreaded
was
flown
her
unadorned
garments
gave
no
particular
attraction
to
the
simple
lines
of
her
form
the
effulgence
of
her
complexion
was
gone
her
cheek
was
pale
and
the
tremulous
motion
of
her
step
deprived
her
of
the
elastic
grace
which
was
usually
the
charm
of
her
figure
triumph
now
sat
in
the
eyes
of
the
countess
and
with
an
air
of
authority
she
waved
helen
to
take
a
seat
beside
lady
ruthven
but
helen
fearful
of
what
might
be
her
emotion
when
the
train
should
enter
had
just
placed
herself
behind
her
aunt
when
the
steps
of
many
a
mailed
foot
sounded
upon
the
oaken
floor
of
the
outward
gallery
the
next
moment
the
great
doors
of
the
huge
screen
opened
and
a
crowd
of
knights
in
armor
flashed
upon
her
eyes
a
strange
dimness
overspread
her
faculties
and
nothing
appeared
to
her
but
an
indistinct
throng
approaching
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
have
been
removed
from
the
spot
but
was
unable
to
stir
and
on
recovering
her
senses
she
beheld
lady
mar
who
exclaiming
ever
my
preserver
had
hastened
forward
now
leaning
on
the
bosom
of
one
of
the
chiefs
his
head
was
bent
as
if
answering
her
in
a
low
voice
by
the
golden
locks
which
hung
down
upon
the
jeweled
tresses
of
the
countess
and
obscured
his
face
she
judged
it
must
indeed
be
the
deliverer
of
her
father
the
knight
of
her
dream
but
where
was
he
who
had
delivered
herself
from
a
worse
fate
than
death
where
was
the
dweller
of
her
daily
thoughts
the
bright
apparition
of
her
unslumbering
pillow
helen
sight
now
clearing
to
as
keen
a
vision
as
before
it
had
been
dulled
and
indistinct
with
a
timid
and
anxious
gaze
glanced
from
face
to
face
of
the
chieftains
around
but
all
were
strange
then
withdrawing
her
eyes
with
a
sad
conviction
that
their
search
was
indeed
in
vain
in
the
very
moment
of
that
despair
they
were
arrested
by
a
glimpse
of
the
features
of
wallace
he
had
raised
his
head
he
shook
back
his
clustering
hair
and
her
secret
was
revealed
in
that
countenance
she
recognized
the
object
of
her
devoted
wishes
and
with
a
gasp
of
overwhelming
surprise
she
must
have
fallen
from
her
seat
had
not
lady
ruthven
hearing
a
sound
like
the
sigh
of
death
turned
round
and
caught
her
in
her
arms
the
cry
of
her
aunt
drew
every
eye
to
the
spot
wallace
immediately
relinquished
the
countess
to
her
husband
and
moved
toward
the
beautiful
and
senseless
form
that
lay
on
the
bosom
of
lady
ruthven
the
earl
and
his
agitated
wife
followed
what
ails
my
helen
asked
the
affectionate
father
i
know
not
replied
his
sister
she
sat
behind
me
and
i
knew
nothing
of
her
disorder
till
she
fell
as
you
see
murray
instantly
supposed
that
she
had
discovered
the
unknown
knight
and
looking
from
countenance
to
countenance
amongst
the
train
to
try
if
he
could
discern
the
envied
cause
of
such
emotions
he
read
in
no
face
an
answering
feeling
with
that
of
helen
and
turning
away
from
his
unavailing
scrutiny
on
hearing
her
draw
a
deep
sigh
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
her
as
if
they
would
have
read
her
soul
wallace
who
in
the
pale
form
before
him
saw
not
only
the
woman
whom
he
had
preserved
with
a
brother
care
but
the
compassionate
saint
who
had
given
a
hallowed
grave
to
the
remains
of
an
angel
pure
as
herself
now
hung
over
her
with
anxiety
so
eloquent
in
every
feature
that
the
countess
would
willingly
at
that
moment
have
stabbed
her
in
every
vein
lady
ruthven
had
sprinkled
her
niece
with
water
and
as
she
began
to
revive
wallace
motioned
to
his
chieftains
to
withdraw
her
eyes
opened
slowly
but
recollection
returning
with
every
reawakened
sense
she
dimly
perceived
a
press
of
people
around
her
and
fearful
of
again
encountering
that
face
which
declared
the
bruce
of
her
secret
meditations
and
the
wallace
of
her
declared
veneration
were
one
she
buried
her
blushes
in
the
bosom
of
her
father
in
that
short
point
of
time
images
of
past
present
and
to
come
rushed
before
her
and
without
confessing
to
herself
why
she
thought
it
necessary
to
make
the
vow
her
soul
seemed
to
swear
on
the
sacred
altar
of
a
parent
heart
never
more
to
think
on
either
idea
separate
it
was
sweet
to
muse
on
her
own
deliverer
it
was
delightful
to
dwell
on
the
virtues
of
her
father
preserver
but
when
she
saw
both
characters
blended
in
one
her
feelings
seemed
sacrilege
and
she
wished
even
to
bury
her
gratitude
where
no
eye
but
heaven
could
see
its
depth
and
fervor
trembling
at
what
might
be
the
consequences
of
this
scene
lady
mar
determined
to
hint
to
wallace
that
helen
loved
some
unknown
knight
and
bending
to
her
daughter
said
in
a
low
voice
yet
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
retire
my
child
you
will
be
better
in
your
own
room
whether
pleasure
or
disappointment
about
the
person
you
wished
to
discover
in
sir
william
train
have
occasioned
these
emotions
helen
recovered
herself
at
this
indelicate
remark
and
raising
her
head
with
that
modest
dignity
which
only
belongs
to
the
purest
mind
gently
but
firmly
said
i
obey
you
madam
and
he
whom
i
have
seen
will
be
too
generous
not
to
pardon
the
effects
of
so
unexpected
a
weight
of
gratitude
as
she
spoke
her
turning
eye
met
the
fixed
gaze
of
wallace
his
countenance
became
agitated
and
dropping
on
his
knee
beside
her
gracious
lady
cried
he
mine
is
the
right
of
gratitude
but
it
is
dear
land
precious
to
me
a
debt
that
my
life
will
not
be
able
to
repay
i
was
ignorant
of
all
your
goodness
when
we
parted
in
the
hermit
cave
but
the
spirit
of
an
angel
like
yourself
lady
helen
will
whisper
to
you
all
her
widowed
husband
thanks
he
pressed
her
hand
fervently
between
his
and
rising
left
the
room
helen
looked
on
with
an
immovable
eye
in
which
the
heroic
vow
of
her
soul
spoke
in
every
beam
but
as
he
arose
even
then
she
felt
its
frailty
for
her
spirit
seemed
leaving
her
and
as
he
disappeared
from
the
door
her
world
seemed
shut
from
her
eyes
not
to
think
of
him
was
impossible
how
to
think
of
him
was
in
her
own
power
her
heart
felt
as
if
suddenly
made
a
desert
but
heroism
was
there
she
had
looked
upon
the
wallace
on
the
widowed
mourner
of
marion
the
saint
and
the
hero
the
being
of
another
world
and
as
such
she
would
regard
him
till
in
the
realms
of
purity
she
might
acknowledge
the
brother
of
her
soul
a
sacred
inspiration
seemed
to
illuminate
her
features
and
to
brace
with
the
vigor
of
immortality
those
limbs
which
before
had
sunk
under
her
she
forgot
she
was
still
of
earth
while
a
holy
love
like
that
of
the
dove
in
paradise
sat
brooding
on
her
heart
lady
mar
gazed
on
her
without
understanding
the
ethereal
meaning
of
those
looks
judging
from
her
own
impassioned
feelings
she
could
only
resolve
the
resplendent
beauty
which
shone
from
the
now
animated
face
and
form
of
helen
into
the
rapture
of
finding
herself
beloved
had
she
not
heard
wallace
declare
himself
to
be
the
unknown
knight
who
had
rescued
helen
she
had
heard
him
devote
his
life
to
her
and
was
not
his
heart
included
in
that
dedication
she
had
then
heard
that
love
vowed
to
another
which
she
would
have
sacrificed
her
soul
to
win
murray
too
was
confounded
but
his
reflections
were
far
different
from
those
of
lady
mar
he
saw
his
newly
passion
smothered
in
its
first
breath
at
the
moment
in
which
he
found
that
he
loved
his
cousin
above
all
of
women
mold
an
unappealable
voice
in
his
bosom
made
him
crush
every
fond
desire
that
heart
which
with
the
chaste
transports
of
a
sister
had
throbbed
so
entrancingly
against
his
was
then
another
was
become
the
captive
of
wallace
virtues
of
the
only
man
who
his
judgment
would
have
said
deserves
helen
mar
but
when
he
clasped
her
glowing
beauties
in
his
arms
only
the
night
before
his
enraptured
soul
then
believed
that
the
tender
smile
he
saw
on
her
lips
was
meant
as
the
sweet
earnest
of
the
happier
moment
when
he
might
hold
her
there
forever
that
dream
was
now
past
well
be
it
so
said
he
to
himself
if
this
too
daring
passion
must
be
clipped
on
the
wing
i
have
at
least
the
consolation
that
it
soared
like
the
bird
of
jove
but
loveliest
of
created
beings
thought
he
looking
on
helen
with
an
expression
which
had
she
met
it
would
have
told
her
all
that
was
passing
in
his
soul
if
i
am
not
to
be
thy
love
i
will
be
thy
friend
and
live
for
thee
and
wallace
believing
that
she
had
read
her
sentence
in
what
she
thought
the
triumphant
glances
of
a
happy
passion
lady
mar
turned
from
her
with
such
a
hatred
kindling
in
her
heart
she
durst
not
trust
her
eyes
to
the
inspection
of
the
bystanders
but
her
tongue
could
not
be
restrained
beyond
the
moment
in
which
the
object
of
her
jealousy
left
the
room
as
the
door
closed
upon
helen
who
retired
leaning
on
the
arms
of
her
aunt
and
edwin
the
countess
turned
to
her
lord
his
eyes
were
looking
with
doting
fondness
toward
the
point
where
she
withdrew
this
sight
augmented
the
angry
tumults
in
the
breast
of
his
wife
and
with
a
bitter
smile
she
said
so
my
lord
you
find
the
icy
bosom
of
your
helen
can
be
thawed
how
do
you
mean
joanna
returned
the
earl
doubting
her
words
and
looks
you
surely
can
not
blame
our
daughter
for
being
sensible
of
gratitude
i
blame
all
young
women
replied
she
who
give
themselves
airs
of
unnatural
coldness
and
then
when
the
proof
comes
behave
in
a
manner
so
extraordinary
so
indelicately
i
must
say
my
lady
mar
ejaculated
the
earl
with
an
amazed
look
what
am
i
to
think
of
you
from
this
how
has
my
daughter
behaved
indelicately
she
did
not
lay
her
head
on
sir
william
wallace
bosom
and
weep
there
till
he
replaced
her
on
her
natural
pillow
mine
have
a
care
madam
that
i
do
not
see
more
in
this
spleen
than
would
be
honorable
to
you
for
me
to
discover
fearing
nothing
so
much
as
that
her
husband
should
really
suspect
the
passion
which
possessed
her
and
so
remove
her
from
the
side
of
wallace
she
presently
recalled
her
former
duplicity
and
with
a
surprised
and
uncomprehending
air
replied
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
donald
then
turning
to
lord
ruthven
who
stood
uneasily
viewing
this
scene
how
cried
she
can
my
lord
discover
spleen
in
my
maternal
anxiety
respecting
the
daughter
of
the
husband
i
love
and
honor
above
all
the
earth
but
men
do
not
properly
estimate
female
reserve
any
woman
would
say
with
me
that
to
faint
at
the
sight
of
sir
william
wallace
was
declaring
an
emotion
not
to
be
revealed
before
so
large
a
company
a
something
from
which
men
might
not
draw
the
most
agreeable
inferences
it
only
declared
surprise
madam
cried
murray
the
surprise
of
a
modest
and
ingenuous
mind
that
did
not
expect
to
recognize
its
mountain
friend
in
the
person
of
the
protector
of
scotland
lady
mar
put
up
her
lip
and
turning
to
the
still
silent
lord
ruthven
again
addressed
him
stepmothers
my
lord
said
she
have
hard
duties
to
perform
and
when
we
think
we
fulfill
them
best
our
suspicious
husband
comes
with
a
magician
wand
and
turns
all
our
good
to
evil
array
your
good
in
a
less
equivocal
garb
my
dear
joanna
answered
the
earl
of
mar
rather
ashamed
of
the
hasty
words
which
indeed
the
suspicion
of
a
moment
had
drawn
from
his
lips
judge
my
child
by
her
usual
conduct
not
by
an
accidental
appearance
of
inconsistency
and
i
shall
ever
be
grateful
for
your
solicitude
but
in
this
instance
though
she
might
betray
the
weakness
of
an
enfeebled
constitution
it
was
certainly
not
the
frailty
of
a
heart
judge
me
by
your
own
rule
dear
donald
cried
his
wife
blandishly
kissing
his
forehead
and
you
will
not
again
wither
the
mother
of
your
boy
with
such
a
look
as
i
just
now
received
glad
to
see
this
reconciliation
lord
ruthven
made
a
sign
to
murray
and
they
withdrew
together
meanwhile
the
honest
earl
surrendering
his
whole
heart
to
the
wiles
of
his
wife
poured
into
her
not
inattentive
ear
all
his
wishes
for
helen
all
the
hopes
to
which
her
late
meeting
with
wallace
and
their
present
recognition
had
given
birth
i
had
rather
have
that
man
my
son
said
he
than
see
my
beloved
daughter
placed
on
an
imperial
throne
i
do
not
doubt
it
thought
lady
mar
for
there
are
many
emperors
but
only
one
william
wallace
however
her
sentiments
she
confined
to
herself
neither
assenting
nor
dissenting
but
answering
so
as
to
secure
the
confidence
by
which
she
hoped
to
traverse
his
designs
according
to
the
inconsistency
of
the
wild
passion
that
possessed
her
one
moment
she
saw
nothing
but
despair
before
her
and
in
the
next
it
seemed
impossible
that
wallace
should
in
heart
be
proof
against
her
tenderness
and
charms
she
remembered
murray
words
that
he
was
sent
to
set
her
free
and
that
recollection
reawakened
every
hope
sir
william
had
placed
lord
mar
in
a
post
as
dangerous
as
honorable
should
the
southrons
return
in
any
force
into
scotland
stirling
must
be
one
of
the
first
places
they
would
attack
the
earl
was
brave
but
his
wounds
had
robbed
him
of
much
of
his
martial
vigor
might
she
not
then
be
indeed
set
free
and
might
not
wallace
on
such
an
event
mean
to
repay
her
for
all
those
sighs
he
now
sought
to
repress
from
ideas
of
a
virtue
which
she
could
admire
but
had
not
the
courage
to
imitate
these
wicked
meditations
passed
even
at
the
side
of
her
husband
and
with
a
view
to
further
every
wish
of
her
intoxicated
imagination
she
determined
to
spare
no
exertion
to
secure
the
support
of
her
own
family
which
when
agreeing
in
one
point
was
the
most
powerful
of
any
in
the
kingdom
her
father
the
earl
of
strathearn
was
now
a
misanthrope
recluse
in
the
orkneys
she
therefore
did
not
calculate
on
his
assistance
but
she
resolved
on
requesting
wallace
to
put
the
names
of
her
cousins
athol
and
badenoch
into
the
exchange
of
prisoners
for
by
their
means
she
expected
to
accomplish
all
she
hoped
on
probable
speedy
death
she
so
long
thought
that
she
regarded
it
as
a
certainty
and
so
pressed
forward
to
the
fulfillment
of
her
love
and
ambition
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
he
were
already
in
his
grave
she
recollected
that
wallace
had
not
this
time
thrown
her
from
his
bosom
when
in
the
transports
of
her
joy
she
cast
herself
upon
it
he
only
gently
whispered
beware
lady
there
are
those
present
who
may
think
my
services
too
richly
paid
with
these
words
he
had
relinquished
her
to
her
husband
but
in
them
she
saw
nothing
inimical
to
her
wishes
it
was
a
caution
not
a
reproof
and
had
not
his
warmer
address
to
helen
conjured
up
all
the
fiends
of
jealousy
she
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
these
grounds
of
though
they
were
like
the
sands
of
the
sea
eager
therefore
to
break
away
from
lord
mar
projects
relating
to
his
daughter
at
the
first
decent
opportunity
she
said
we
will
consider
more
of
this
donald
i
now
resign
you
to
the
duties
of
your
office
and
shall
pay
mine
to
her
whose
interest
is
our
own
lord
mar
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
they
parted
prior
to
wallace
visit
to
the
citadel
which
was
to
be
at
an
early
hour
the
same
morning
a
list
of
the
noble
prisoners
was
put
into
his
hand
edwin
pointed
to
the
name
of
lord
montgomery
that
said
he
is
the
name
of
the
person
you
already
esteem
but
how
will
you
regard
him
when
i
tell
you
who
he
was
wallace
turned
on
him
an
inquiring
look
you
have
often
spoken
to
me
of
sir
gilbert
and
this
be
he
interrupted
wallace
edwin
recounted
the
manner
of
the
earl
discovering
himself
and
how
he
came
to
bear
that
title
wallace
listened
in
silence
and
when
his
young
friend
ended
sighed
heavily
i
will
thank
him
was
all
he
said
and
rising
he
proceeded
to
the
chamber
of
montgomery
even
at
that
early
hour
it
was
filled
with
his
officers
come
to
inquire
after
their
late
commander
health
wallace
advanced
to
the
couch
and
the
southrons
drew
back
the
expression
of
his
countenance
told
the
earl
that
he
now
knew
him
noblest
of
englishmen
cried
wallace
in
a
low
voice
i
come
to
express
a
gratitude
to
you
as
lasting
as
the
memory
of
the
action
which
gave
it
birth
your
generous
conduct
to
all
that
was
dearest
to
me
on
earth
was
that
night
in
the
garden
of
ellerslie
witnessed
by
myself
i
was
in
the
tree
above
your
head
and
nothing
but
a
conviction
that
i
should
embarrass
the
honor
of
my
wife
protector
could
at
that
moment
have
prevented
my
springing
from
my
covert
and
declaring
my
gratitude
on
the
spot
receive
my
thanks
now
inadequate
as
they
are
to
express
what
i
feel
but
you
offered
me
your
heart
on
the
field
of
i
will
take
that
as
a
generous
intimation
how
i
may
best
acknowledge
my
debt
receive
then
my
friendship
the
eternal
gratitude
of
my
immortal
spirit
the
answer
of
montgomery
could
not
but
refer
to
the
same
subject
and
by
presenting
the
tender
form
of
his
wife
and
her
devoted
love
almost
visibly
again
before
her
widowed
husband
nearly
forced
open
the
fountain
of
tears
which
he
had
buried
deep
in
his
heart
and
rising
suddenly
for
fear
his
emotions
might
betray
themselves
he
warmly
pressed
the
hand
of
his
english
friend
and
left
the
room
in
the
course
of
the
same
day
the
southron
nobles
were
transported
into
the
citadel
and
the
family
of
mar
removed
from
the
fortress
to
take
up
their
residence
in
the
palace
of
snawdoun
chapter
xxxvi
the
carse
of
stirling
the
fame
of
these
victories
the
seizure
of
stirling
the
conquest
of
above
sixty
thousand
men
and
the
lord
warden
with
his
late
deputy
taken
prisoners
all
spread
through
the
country
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
messengers
were
dispatched
by
wallace
not
only
to
the
nobles
who
had
already
declared
for
the
cause
by
sending
him
their
armed
followers
but
to
the
clans
who
yet
stood
irresolute
to
the
chiefs
who
had
taken
the
side
of
edward
he
sent
no
exhortation
and
when
lord
ruthven
advised
him
to
do
so
no
my
lord
said
he
we
must
not
spread
a
snare
under
our
country
and
as
they
had
the
power
to
befriend
her
they
would
not
have
colleagued
with
her
enemies
they
remember
her
happiness
under
the
rule
of
our
alexanders
they
see
her
sufferings
beneath
the
sway
of
a
usurper
and
if
they
can
know
these
things
and
require
arguments
to
bring
them
to
their
duty
should
they
then
come
to
it
it
would
not
be
to
fulfill
but
to
betray
ours
my
dear
lord
ruthven
is
a
commission
from
heaven
the
truth
of
our
cause
is
own
signet
and
is
so
clear
that
it
need
only
be
seen
to
be
acknowledged
all
honest
minds
will
come
to
us
of
themselves
and
those
who
are
not
so
had
better
be
avoided
than
shown
the
way
by
which
treachery
may
effect
what
open
violence
can
not
accomplish
this
reasoning
drawn
from
the
experience
of
nature
neither
encumbered
by
the
subtleties
of
policy
nor
the
sophistry
of
the
schools
was
evident
to
every
honest
understanding
and
decided
the
question
lady
mar
unknown
to
any
one
again
applied
to
her
fatal
pen
but
with
other
views
than
for
the
ruin
of
the
cause
or
the
destruction
of
wallace
it
was
to
strengthen
his
hands
with
the
power
of
all
her
kinsmen
and
finally
by
the
crown
which
they
should
place
on
his
head
exalt
her
to
the
dignity
of
a
queen
she
wrote
first
to
john
cummin
earl
of
buchan
enforcing
a
thousand
reasons
why
he
should
now
leave
a
sinking
cause
and
join
the
rising
fortunes
of
his
country
you
see
said
she
that
the
happy
star
of
edward
is
setting
the
king
of
france
not
only
maintains
possession
of
that
territory
at
guienne
but
he
holds
him
in
check
on
the
shores
of
flanders
baffled
abroad
an
insurrection
awaits
him
at
home
the
priesthood
whom
he
has
insulted
trample
name
with
anathemas
the
nobles
whom
he
has
insulted
trample
on
his
prerogative
and
the
people
whose
privileges
he
has
invaded
call
aloud
for
redress
the
proud
barons
of
england
are
ready
to
revolt
and
the
lords
hereford
and
norfolk
those
two
earls
whom
after
madly
threatening
to
hang
he
sought
to
bribe
to
their
allegiance
by
leaving
them
in
the
full
powers
of
constable
and
marshal
of
england
they
are
now
conducting
themselves
with
such
domineering
consequence
that
even
the
prince
of
wales
submits
to
their
directions
and
the
throne
of
the
absent
tyrant
is
shaken
to
its
center
intended
to
send
out
forces
to
guienne
under
the
command
of
humphrey
earl
of
hereford
the
constable
and
roger
earl
of
norfolk
the
marshal
of
england
when
these
two
powerful
nobles
refused
to
execute
his
commands
a
violent
altercation
ensued
and
the
king
in
the
height
of
his
passion
exclaimed
to
the
constable
sir
earl
by
you
shall
either
go
or
hang
by
sir
king
replied
hereford
i
will
neither
go
nor
hang
and
he
immediately
departed
with
the
marshal
and
their
respective
trains
sir
william
wallace
has
rescued
scotland
from
his
yoke
the
country
now
calls
for
her
ancient
lords
those
who
made
her
kings
and
supported
them
come
then
my
cousin
espouse
the
cause
of
right
the
cause
that
is
in
power
the
cause
that
may
aggrandize
the
house
of
cummin
with
still
higher
dignities
than
any
with
which
it
has
hitherto
been
blazoned
with
these
arguments
and
with
others
more
adapted
to
his
belial
mind
she
tried
to
bring
him
to
her
purpose
to
awaken
what
ambition
he
possessed
and
to
entice
his
baser
passions
by
offering
security
in
a
rescued
country
to
the
indulgence
of
senses
to
which
he
had
already
sacrificed
the
best
properties
of
man
she
dispatched
her
letter
by
a
messenger
whom
she
bribed
to
secrecy
and
added
in
her
postscript
that
the
answer
she
should
hope
to
receive
would
be
an
offer
of
his
services
to
sir
william
wallace
while
the
countess
of
mar
was
devising
her
plans
for
the
gaining
of
lord
buchan
was
only
a
preliminary
measure
the
dispatches
of
wallace
had
taken
effect
their
simple
details
and
the
voice
of
fame
had
roused
a
general
spirit
throughout
the
land
and
in
the
course
of
a
very
short
time
after
the
different
messengers
had
left
stirling
the
plain
around
the
city
was
covered
with
a
mixed
multitude
all
scotland
seemed
pressing
to
throw
itself
at
the
feet
of
its
preserver
a
large
body
of
men
brought
from
mar
by
murray
according
to
his
uncle
orders
were
amongst
the
first
encamped
on
the
carse
and
that
part
of
wallace
own
particular
band
which
he
had
left
at
dumbarton
to
recover
their
wounds
now
under
the
command
of
stephen
ireland
rejoined
their
lord
at
stirling
neil
campbell
the
brave
lord
of
and
lord
bothwell
the
father
of
lord
andrew
murray
with
a
strong
reinforcement
arrived
from
argyleshire
the
chiefs
of
ross
dundas
gordon
lockhart
logan
elphinstone
scott
erskine
lindsay
cameron
and
of
almost
every
noble
family
in
scotland
sent
their
sons
at
the
heads
of
detachments
from
their
clans
to
swell
the
ranks
of
sir
william
wallace
when
this
patriotic
host
assembled
on
the
carse
of
stirling
every
inmate
of
the
city
who
had
not
duty
to
confine
him
within
the
walls
turned
out
to
view
the
glorious
sight
mounted
within
the
walls
turned
out
to
view
the
glorious
sight
mounted
on
a
rising
ground
they
saw
each
little
army
and
the
emblazoned
banners
of
all
the
chivalry
of
scotland
floating
afar
over
the
lengthened
ranks
at
this
moment
the
lines
which
guarded
the
outworks
of
stirling
opened
from
right
to
left
and
discovered
wallace
advancing
on
a
white
charger
when
the
conqueror
of
edward
hosts
appeared
the
deliverer
of
scotland
a
mighty
shout
from
the
thousands
around
rent
the
skies
and
shook
the
earth
on
which
they
stood
wallace
raised
his
helmet
from
his
brow
as
by
an
instinctive
motion
every
hand
bent
the
sword
or
banner
it
contained
he
comes
in
the
strength
of
david
cried
the
venerable
bishop
of
dunkeld
who
appeared
at
the
head
of
his
church
tenantry
scots
behold
the
lord
anointed
the
exclamation
which
burst
like
inspiration
from
the
lips
of
the
bishop
struck
to
every
heart
long
live
our
william
the
lion
our
scottish
king
was
echoed
with
transport
by
every
follower
on
the
ground
and
while
the
reverberating
heavens
seemed
to
ratify
the
voice
of
the
people
the
lords
themselves
believing
that
he
who
won
had
the
best
right
to
enjoy
joined
in
the
glorious
cry
galloping
up
from
the
front
of
their
ranks
they
threw
themselves
from
their
steeds
and
before
wallace
could
recover
from
the
surprise
into
which
this
unexpected
salutation
had
thrown
him
lord
bothwell
and
lord
followed
by
the
rest
had
bent
their
knees
and
acknowledged
him
to
be
their
sovereign
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
at
the
same
moment
drawing
from
his
breast
a
silver
dove
of
sacred
oil
poured
it
upon
the
unbonneted
head
of
wallace
thus
o
king
cried
he
do
i
consecrate
on
earth
what
has
already
received
the
unction
of
heaven
wallace
at
this
action
was
and
raising
his
eyes
to
that
heaven
his
soul
in
silence
breathed
its
unutterable
devotion
then
looking
on
the
bishop
holy
father
said
he
this
unction
may
have
prepared
my
brows
for
a
crown
but
it
is
not
of
this
world
and
divine
mercy
must
bestow
it
rise
lords
and
as
he
spoke
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
and
taking
lord
bothwell
by
the
hand
as
the
eldest
of
the
band
kneel
not
to
me
cried
he
i
am
to
you
what
gideon
was
to
the
israelites
your
i
can
not
assume
the
scepter
you
would
bestow
for
he
who
rules
us
all
has
yet
preserved
to
you
a
lawful
monarch
bruce
lives
and
were
he
extinct
the
blood
royal
flows
in
too
many
noble
veins
in
scotland
for
me
to
usurp
its
rights
the
rights
of
the
crown
lie
with
the
only
man
in
scotland
who
knows
how
to
defend
them
else
reason
is
blind
or
the
nation
abandons
its
own
prerogative
what
we
have
this
moment
vowed
is
not
to
be
forsworn
baliol
has
abdicated
our
throne
the
bruce
deserted
it
all
our
nobles
slept
till
you
awoke
and
shall
we
bow
to
men
who
may
follow
but
will
not
lead
no
bravest
wallace
from
the
moment
you
drew
the
first
sword
for
scotland
you
made
yourself
her
lawful
king
wallace
turned
to
the
veteran
lord
of
who
uttered
this
with
a
blunt
determination
that
meant
to
say
the
election
which
had
passed
should
not
be
recalled
i
made
myself
her
champion
to
fight
for
her
freedom
not
my
own
aggrandizement
were
i
to
accept
the
honor
with
which
this
too
grateful
nation
would
repay
my
service
i
should
not
bring
it
that
peace
for
which
i
contend
struggling
for
liberty
the
toils
of
my
brave
countrymen
would
be
redoubled
for
they
would
have
to
maintain
the
tights
of
an
unallied
king
against
a
host
of
enemies
the
circumstances
of
a
man
from
the
private
stations
of
life
being
elevated
to
such
a
dignity
would
be
felt
as
an
insult
by
every
royal
house
and
foes
and
friends
would
arm
against
us
on
these
grounds
of
policy
alone
even
were
my
heart
not
loyal
to
the
vows
of
my
ancestors
i
should
repel
the
mischief
you
would
bring
upon
yourselves
by
making
me
your
king
as
it
is
my
conscience
as
well
as
my
judgment
compels
me
reject
it
as
your
general
i
may
serve
you
gloriously
as
your
monarch
in
spite
of
myself
i
should
incur
your
ultimate
destruction
from
whom
noblest
of
scots
asked
the
lord
of
bothwell
from
yourselves
my
friends
answered
wallace
with
a
gentle
smile
could
i
take
advantage
of
the
generous
enthusiasm
of
a
grateful
nation
could
i
forget
the
duty
i
owe
to
the
blood
of
our
alexanders
and
leap
into
the
throne
there
are
many
who
would
soon
revolt
against
their
own
election
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
there
are
natures
who
would
endure
no
rule
did
it
not
come
by
the
right
of
inheritance
a
right
by
dispute
lest
they
teach
their
inferiors
the
same
refractory
lesson
but
to
bend
with
voluntary
subjection
to
long
obey
a
power
raised
by
themselves
would
be
a
sacrifice
abhorrent
to
their
pride
after
having
displayed
their
efficiency
in
making
a
king
they
would
prove
their
independence
by
striving
to
pull
him
down
the
moment
he
made
them
feel
his
specter
such
would
be
the
fate
of
this
election
jealousies
and
rebellions
would
mark
my
reign
till
even
my
closest
adherents
seeing
the
miseries
of
civil
war
would
fall
from
my
side
and
leave
the
country
again
open
to
the
inroads
of
her
enemies
these
my
friends
and
countrymen
would
be
my
reasons
for
rejecting
the
crown
did
my
ambition
point
that
way
but
as
i
have
no
joy
in
titles
no
pleasure
in
any
power
that
does
not
spring
hourly
from
the
heart
let
my
reign
be
in
your
bosoms
and
with
the
appellation
of
your
your
friend
i
will
fight
for
you
i
will
conquer
for
you
i
will
live
or
die
this
man
whispered
lord
buchan
who
having
arrived
in
the
rear
of
the
troops
on
the
appearance
of
wallace
advanced
within
hearing
of
what
he
this
man
shows
more
cunning
in
repulsing
a
crown
than
most
are
capable
of
exerting
to
obtain
one
ay
but
let
us
see
returned
the
earl
of
march
who
accompanied
him
whether
it
be
not
caesar
coyness
he
thrice
refused
the
purple
and
yet
he
died
emperor
of
the
romans
he
that
offers
me
a
crown
returned
buchan
shall
never
catch
me
playing
the
coquette
with
its
charms
i
warrant
you
i
would
embrace
the
lovely
mischief
in
the
first
presentation
a
shout
rent
the
air
what
is
that
cried
he
interrupting
himself
he
has
followed
your
advice
answered
march
with
a
satirical
smile
it
is
the
preliminary
trumpet
to
long
live
king
william
the
great
lord
buchan
spurred
forward
to
scrymgeour
whom
he
knew
and
inquired
where
the
new
king
was
to
be
crowned
we
have
not
yet
to
thank
him
for
the
possession
of
scone
true
cried
sir
alexander
comprehending
the
sarcasm
but
did
sir
william
wallace
accept
the
prayers
of
scotland
neither
scone
nor
any
other
spot
in
the
kingdom
would
refuse
the
place
of
his
coronation
not
accept
them
replied
buchan
then
why
the
shout
do
the
changelings
rejoice
in
being
refused
when
we
can
not
gain
the
altitude
of
our
desires
returned
the
knight
it
is
yet
subject
for
thankfulness
when
we
reach
a
step
toward
it
sir
william
wallace
has
consented
to
be
considered
as
the
protector
of
the
kingdom
to
hold
it
for
the
rightful
sovereign
under
the
name
of
regent
ay
cried
march
he
has
only
taken
a
mistress
instead
of
a
wife
and
trust
me
when
once
he
has
got
her
into
his
arms
it
will
not
be
all
the
gray
beards
in
scotland
that
can
wrest
her
thence
again
i
marvel
to
see
how
men
can
be
cajoled
and
call
the
visor
virtue
scrymgeour
had
not
waited
for
this
reply
of
the
insolent
earl
and
buchan
answered
him
i
care
not
said
he
whoever
keeps
my
castle
over
my
head
and
my
cellars
full
is
welcome
to
reign
over
john
of
buchan
so
onward
my
gallant
cospatrick
to
make
our
bow
to
royalty
in
masquerade
when
these
scorners
approached
they
found
wallace
standing
uncovered
in
the
midst
of
his
happy
nobles
there
was
not
a
man
present
to
whom
he
had
not
given
proofs
of
his
divine
commission
each
individual
was
snatched
from
a
state
of
oppression
and
disgrace
and
placed
in
security
and
honor
with
overflowing
gratitude
they
all
thronged
around
him
and
the
young
the
isolated
wallace
found
a
nation
waiting
on
his
nod
the
hearts
of
half
a
million
of
people
offered
to
his
hand
to
turn
and
wind
them
as
he
pleased
no
crown
sat
on
his
brows
but
the
bright
halo
of
true
glory
beamed
from
his
godlike
countenance
it
even
checked
the
arrogant
smiles
with
which
the
haughty
march
and
the
voluptuous
buchan
came
forward
to
mock
him
with
their
homage
as
the
near
relations
of
lady
mar
he
received
them
with
courtesy
but
one
glance
of
his
eye
penetrated
to
the
hollowness
of
both
and
then
remounting
his
steed
the
stirrups
of
which
were
held
by
edwin
and
ker
he
touched
the
head
of
the
former
with
his
hand
follow
me
my
friend
i
now
go
to
pay
my
duty
to
your
mother
for
you
my
lords
said
he
turning
to
the
nobles
around
i
shall
hope
to
meet
you
at
noon
in
the
citadel
where
we
must
consult
together
on
further
prompt
movements
nothing
with
us
can
be
considered
as
won
till
all
is
gained
the
chieftains
with
bows
acquiesced
in
his
mandate
and
fell
back
toward
their
troops
but
the
foremost
ranks
of
those
brave
fellows
having
heard
much
of
what
had
passed
were
so
inflamed
with
admiration
of
their
regent
that
they
rushed
forward
and
collecting
in
crowds
around
his
horse
and
in
his
path
some
pressed
to
kiss
his
hand
and
others
his
way
shouting
and
calling
down
blessings
upon
him
till
he
stopped
at
the
gate
of
snawdoun
chapter
xxxvii
snawdoun
palace
owing
to
the
multiplicity
of
affairs
which
engaged
wallace
attention
after
the
capture
of
stirling
the
ladies
of
mar
had
not
seen
him
since
his
first
visit
to
the
citadel
the
countess
passed
this
time
in
writing
her
dispatches
to
the
numerous
lords
of
her
house
both
in
scotland
and
in
england
and
by
her
subtle
arguments
she
completely
persuaded
her
husband
of
the
cogency
of
putting
the
names
of
lord
athol
and
lord
badenoch
into
the
list
of
noble
prisoners
he
should
request
when
this
was
proposed
to
wallace
he
recollected
the
conduct
of
athol
at
montrose
and
being
alone
with
lord
mar
he
made
some
objections
against
inviting
him
back
into
the
country
but
the
earl
who
was
prepared
by
his
wife
to
overcome
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
her
kinsman
return
answered
that
he
believed
from
the
representations
he
had
received
of
the
private
opinions
both
of
badenoch
and
athol
that
their
treason
was
more
against
baliol
than
the
kingdom
and
that
now
that
prince
was
irretrievably
removed
he
understood
they
would
be
glad
to
take
a
part
in
its
recovery
that
may
be
the
case
with
the
earl
of
badenoch
replied
wallace
but
something
less
friendly
to
scotland
must
be
in
the
breast
of
the
man
who
could
betray
lord
douglas
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
so
i
should
have
thought
replied
the
earl
had
not
the
earnestness
with
which
my
wife
pleads
his
cause
convinced
me
she
knows
more
of
his
mind
than
she
chooses
to
intrust
me
with
and
therefore
i
suppose
his
conduct
to
douglas
arose
from
personal
pique
though
these
explanations
did
not
at
all
raise
the
absent
lords
in
his
esteem
yet
to
appear
hostile
to
the
return
of
lady
mar
relations
would
be
a
violence
to
her
which
in
proportion
as
wallace
shrunk
from
the
guilty
affection
she
was
so
eager
to
lavish
upon
him
he
was
averse
to
committing
wishing
by
showing
her
every
proper
consideration
to
lead
her
to
apprehend
the
turpitude
of
her
conduct
by
convincing
her
that
his
abhorrence
of
her
advances
had
its
origin
in
principle
rather
than
from
personal
repugnance
to
herself
and
so
she
might
see
the
foulness
of
her
crime
and
be
recalled
to
virtue
he
was
therefore
not
displeased
to
have
this
opportunity
of
obliging
her
and
as
he
hoped
that
amongst
so
many
warm
friends
a
few
cool
ones
could
not
do
much
injury
he
gave
in
the
names
of
badenoch
and
athol
with
those
of
lord
douglas
sir
william
maitland
the
only
son
of
the
venerable
knight
of
thirlestane
sir
john
monteith
and
many
other
brave
scots
for
these
the
earls
de
warenne
de
valence
and
montgomery
the
barons
hilton
and
blenkinsopp
and
others
of
note
were
to
exchanged
those
of
lesser
consequence
man
for
man
were
to
be
returned
for
scots
of
the
same
degree
in
arranging
preliminaries
to
effect
the
speedy
return
of
the
scots
from
england
who
must
be
known
to
have
arrived
on
the
borders
before
the
english
would
be
permitted
to
cross
them
in
writing
dispatches
on
this
subject
and
on
others
of
equal
moment
had
passed
the
time
between
the
surrender
of
stirling
and
the
hour
when
wallace
was
called
to
the
plain
to
receive
the
offered
homage
of
his
grateful
country
impatient
to
behold
again
the
object
of
her
fond
machinations
lady
mar
hastened
to
the
window
of
her
apartment
when
the
shouts
in
the
streets
informed
her
of
the
approach
of
wallace
the
loud
huzzas
accompanied
by
the
acclamations
of
our
protector
and
prince
seemed
already
to
bind
her
brows
with
her
anticipated
diadem
and
for
a
moment
vanity
lost
the
image
of
love
in
the
purple
with
which
she
enveloped
it
her
ambitious
vision
was
disturbed
by
the
crowd
rushing
forward
the
gates
were
thronged
with
people
of
every
age
and
sex
and
wallace
himself
appeared
on
his
white
charger
with
his
helmet
off
bowing
and
smiling
upon
the
populace
there
was
a
mild
effulgence
in
his
eye
a
divine
benevolence
in
his
countenance
as
his
parted
lips
showed
the
brightness
of
his
smile
which
seemed
to
speak
of
happiness
within
of
joy
to
all
around
she
hastily
snatched
a
chaplet
of
flowers
form
her
head
and
threw
it
from
the
window
wallace
looked
up
his
brow
and
his
smile
were
then
directed
to
her
but
they
were
altered
the
moment
he
met
the
congratulation
of
her
eager
eyes
he
remembered
what
would
have
been
the
soft
welcome
of
his
marion
under
the
like
circumstance
but
that
tender
eye
was
closed
that
ear
was
shut
to
whom
he
would
have
wished
these
plaudits
to
have
given
rapture
and
they
were
now
as
nothing
to
him
the
countess
saw
not
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
but
kissing
her
hand
to
him
disappeared
from
the
window
when
he
entered
the
palace
another
eye
beside
lady
mar
had
witnessed
the
triumphant
entry
of
wallace
triumphant
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
for
he
came
a
victor
over
the
hearts
of
men
he
came
not
attended
by
his
captives
won
in
the
war
but
by
the
people
he
had
blessed
by
throngs
calling
him
preserver
father
friend
and
prince
by
every
title
which
can
inspire
the
soul
of
man
with
the
happy
consciousness
of
fulfilling
his
embassy
here
below
helen
was
this
witness
she
had
passed
the
long
interval
since
she
had
seen
wallace
in
the
state
of
one
in
a
dream
the
glance
had
been
so
transient
that
every
succeeding
hour
seemed
to
lessen
the
evidence
of
her
senses
that
she
had
really
beheld
him
it
appeared
impossible
to
her
that
the
man
whom
her
thoughts
had
hitherto
dwelt
on
as
the
widowed
husband
of
marion
as
the
hero
whom
sorrow
had
wholly
dedicated
to
patriotism
and
to
heaven
should
ever
awaken
in
her
breast
feelings
which
would
seem
to
break
like
a
sacrilegious
host
upon
the
holy
consecration
of
his
once
she
had
contemplated
this
idea
with
the
pensive
impressions
of
one
leaning
over
the
grave
of
a
hero
and
she
could
then
turn
as
if
emerging
from
the
glooms
of
sepulchral
monuments
to
upper
day
to
the
image
of
her
unknown
knight
she
could
then
blamelessly
recollect
the
matchless
graces
of
his
figure
the
noble
soul
that
breathed
from
his
every
word
and
action
the
sweet
though
thoughtful
serenity
that
sat
on
his
brow
there
whispered
she
to
herself
are
the
lofty
meditations
of
a
royal
mind
devising
the
freedom
of
his
people
when
that
is
effected
how
will
the
perfect
sunshine
break
out
from
that
face
ah
how
blest
must
scotland
be
under
his
reign
when
all
will
be
light
virtue
and
joy
bliss
hovered
like
an
angel
over
the
image
of
this
imaginary
bruce
while
sorrow
in
mourning
weeds
seemed
ever
dropping
tears
when
any
circumstance
recalled
that
of
the
real
wallace
such
was
the
state
of
helen
thoughts
when
in
the
moment
beholding
the
chief
ellerslie
in
the
citadel
she
recognized
in
his
expected
melancholy
form
the
resplendent
countenance
of
him
whom
she
supposed
the
prince
of
scotland
that
two
images
so
opposite
should
at
once
unite
that
in
one
bosom
should
be
mingled
all
the
virtues
she
had
believed
peculiar
to
each
struck
her
with
overwhelming
amazement
but
when
she
recovered
from
her
short
swoon
and
found
wallace
at
her
feet
when
she
felt
that
all
the
devotion
her
heart
had
hitherto
paid
to
the
simple
idea
of
virtue
alone
would
now
be
attracted
to
that
glorious
mortal
in
whom
all
human
excellence
appeared
summed
up
she
trembled
under
an
emotion
that
seemed
to
rob
her
of
herself
and
place
a
new
principle
of
being
within
her
all
was
so
extraordinary
so
unlooked
for
so
bewildering
that
from
the
moment
in
which
she
had
retired
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
feelings
from
her
first
interview
in
the
gallery
with
him
she
became
altogether
like
a
person
in
a
trance
and
hardly
answering
her
aunt
when
she
then
led
her
up
the
stairs
only
complained
she
was
ill
and
threw
herself
upon
a
couch
at
the
very
time
that
her
heart
told
her
in
a
language
she
could
not
misunderstand
that
she
irrevocably
loved
this
too
glorious
too
amiable
wallace
it
as
powerfully
denounced
to
her
that
she
had
devoted
herself
to
one
who
must
ever
be
to
her
as
a
being
of
air
no
word
of
sympathy
would
ever
whisper
felicity
to
her
heart
no
the
flame
that
was
within
her
which
she
found
would
be
immortal
as
the
vestal
fires
which
resemble
its
purity
must
burn
there
unknown
hidden
but
not
smothered
were
this
a
canonized
saint
cried
she
as
she
laid
her
throbbing
head
upon
her
pillow
how
gladly
should
i
feel
these
emotions
for
could
i
not
fall
down
and
worship
him
could
i
not
think
it
a
world
of
bliss
to
live
forever
within
the
influence
of
his
virtues
looking
at
him
listening
to
him
rejoicing
in
his
praises
happy
in
his
happiness
yes
though
i
were
a
peasant
girl
and
he
not
know
that
helen
mar
even
existed
and
i
may
live
thus
said
she
and
i
may
steal
some
portion
of
the
rare
lot
that
was
lady
die
for
such
a
man
ah
could
i
be
in
edwin
place
and
wait
upon
his
smiles
but
that
may
not
be
i
am
a
woman
and
formed
to
suffer
in
silence
and
seclusion
but
even
at
a
distance
brave
wallace
my
spirit
shall
watch
over
you
in
the
form
of
this
edwin
i
will
teach
him
a
double
care
of
the
light
of
scotland
and
my
prayers
also
shall
follow
you
so
that
when
we
meet
in
heaven
the
blessed
virgin
shall
say
with
what
hosts
of
angels
her
intercessions
through
my
vigils
have
surrounded
thee
chapter
xxxviii
the
bower
or
ladies
apartment
thus
did
lady
helen
commune
with
her
own
heart
sometimes
doubting
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
then
convinced
of
their
fidelity
striving
to
allay
the
tumults
in
her
mind
she
seldom
appeared
from
her
own
rooms
and
such
retirement
was
not
questioned
her
father
being
altogether
engaged
at
the
citadel
the
countess
absorbed
in
her
own
speculations
and
lady
ruthven
alone
interrupted
the
solitude
of
her
niece
by
frequent
visits
little
suspecting
the
cause
of
helen
prolonged
indisposition
she
generally
selected
wallace
for
the
subject
of
conversation
she
descanted
with
enthusiasm
on
the
rare
perfection
of
his
character
told
her
all
that
edwin
had
related
of
his
actions
from
the
taking
of
dumbarton
to
the
present
moment
and
then
bade
helen
remark
the
miracle
of
such
wisdom
valor
and
goodness
being
found
in
one
so
young
and
handsome
so
my
child
added
she
depend
on
it
before
he
was
lady
husband
he
must
have
heard
sighs
enough
from
the
fairest
in
our
land
to
have
turned
the
wits
of
half
the
male
world
there
is
something
in
his
very
look
did
you
meet
him
on
the
heath
without
better
barg
than
a
shepherd
plaid
sufficient
to
declare
him
the
noblest
of
men
and
methinks
would
excuse
the
gentlest
lady
in
the
land
for
leaving
hall
and
bower
to
share
his
but
alas
and
then
the
playful
expression
of
her
countenance
altered
he
is
now
for
none
on
earth
with
these
words
she
turned
the
subject
to
the
confidential
hours
he
passed
with
the
young
adopted
brother
of
his
heart
every
fond
emotion
seemed
then
centered
in
his
wife
and
child
when
lady
ruthven
repeated
his
pathetic
words
to
edwin
she
wept
she
even
sobbed
and
paused
to
recover
while
the
deep
and
silent
tears
which
flowed
from
the
heart
to
the
eyes
of
lady
helen
bathed
the
side
of
the
couch
on
which
she
leaned
alas
cried
lady
ruthven
that
a
man
so
formed
to
grace
every
relation
in
life
so
noble
a
creature
in
all
respects
so
fond
of
a
husband
so
full
of
parental
tenderness
that
he
should
be
deprived
of
the
wife
on
whom
he
doted
that
he
should
be
cut
off
from
all
hope
of
posterity
that
when
he
shall
die
nothing
will
be
left
of
william
wallace
breaks
my
heart
ah
my
aunt
cried
helen
raising
her
head
with
animation
will
he
not
leave
behind
him
the
liberty
of
scotland
that
is
an
offspring
worthy
of
his
soul
true
my
dear
helen
but
had
you
ever
been
a
parent
you
would
know
that
no
achievements
however
great
can
heal
the
wound
made
in
a
father
heart
by
the
loss
of
a
beloved
child
and
though
sir
william
wallace
never
saw
the
infant
ready
to
bless
his
arms
yet
it
perished
in
the
bosom
of
its
mother
and
that
circumstance
must
redouble
his
affliction
horribly
does
it
enhance
the
cruelty
of
the
deed
he
has
in
all
things
been
a
direful
sacrifice
returned
helen
and
with
god
alone
dwells
the
power
to
wipe
the
tears
from
his
heart
they
flow
not
from
his
eyes
answered
her
aunt
but
deep
deep
is
the
grief
that
my
edwin
says
is
settled
there
while
lady
ruthven
was
uttering
these
words
shouts
in
the
street
made
her
pause
and
soon
recognizing
the
name
of
wallace
sounding
from
the
lips
of
the
rejoicing
multitude
she
turned
to
helen
here
comes
our
deliverer
cried
she
taking
her
by
the
hand
we
have
not
seen
him
since
the
first
day
of
our
liberty
it
will
do
you
good
as
it
will
me
to
look
on
his
beneficent
face
she
obeyed
the
impulse
of
her
aunt
arm
and
reached
the
window
just
as
he
passed
into
the
courtyard
helen
soul
seemed
rushing
from
her
eyes
ah
it
is
indeed
he
thought
she
no
dream
no
illusion
but
his
very
self
he
looked
up
but
not
on
her
side
of
the
building
it
was
to
the
window
of
lady
mar
and
as
he
bowed
he
smiled
all
the
charms
of
that
smile
struck
upon
the
soul
of
helen
and
hastily
retreating
she
sunk
breathless
into
a
seat
o
no
that
man
can
not
be
born
for
the
isolated
state
i
have
just
lamented
he
is
not
to
be
forever
cut
off
from
communicating
that
happiness
to
which
he
would
give
so
much
enchantment
lady
ruthven
ejaculated
this
with
fervor
her
matron
cheeks
flushing
with
a
sudden
and
more
forcible
admiration
of
the
person
and
mien
of
wallace
there
was
something
in
that
smile
helen
which
tells
me
all
is
not
chilled
within
and
indeed
how
should
it
be
otherwise
that
generous
interest
in
the
happiness
of
all
which
seems
to
flow
in
a
tide
of
universal
love
can
not
spring
from
a
source
incapable
of
dispensing
the
softer
screams
of
it
again
helen
whose
soul
was
not
affected
by
the
agitation
of
her
body
agitation
she
was
determined
to
conquer
calmly
answered
such
a
hope
little
agrees
with
all
you
have
been
telling
me
of
his
conversation
with
edwin
sir
william
wallace
will
never
love
woman
more
and
even
to
name
the
idea
seems
an
offense
against
the
sacredness
of
his
sorrow
blame
me
not
helen
returned
lady
ruthven
that
i
forgot
probability
in
grasping
at
possibility
which
might
give
me
such
a
nephew
as
sir
william
wallace
and
you
a
husband
worthy
of
your
merits
i
had
always
in
my
own
mind
fixed
on
the
unknown
knight
for
your
future
lord
and
now
that
i
find
that
he
and
the
deliverer
of
scotland
are
one
i
am
not
to
be
looked
grave
at
for
wishing
to
reward
him
with
the
most
precious
heart
that
ever
beat
in
a
female
breast
no
more
of
this
if
you
love
me
my
dear
aunt
returned
helen
it
neither
can
nor
ought
to
be
i
revere
the
memory
of
lady
marion
too
much
not
to
be
agitated
by
the
subject
so
no
more
was
agitated
but
at
that
instant
edwin
throwing
open
the
door
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
he
came
to
apprise
his
mother
that
sir
william
wallace
was
in
the
state
apartments
come
purposely
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
not
having
even
been
introduced
to
her
when
the
sudden
illness
of
her
niece
in
the
castle
had
made
them
part
so
abruptly
i
will
not
interrupt
his
introduction
now
said
helen
with
a
faint
smile
a
few
days
retirement
will
strengthen
me
and
then
i
shall
see
our
protector
as
i
ought
i
will
stay
with
you
cried
edwin
and
i
dare
say
sir
william
wallace
will
have
no
objection
to
be
speedily
joined
by
my
mother
for
as
i
came
along
i
met
my
aunt
mar
hastening
through
the
gallery
and
between
ourselves
my
sweet
coz
i
do
not
think
my
noble
friend
quite
likes
a
private
conference
with
your
fair
stepmother
lady
ruthven
had
withdrawn
before
he
made
this
observation
why
edwin
she
would
not
do
anything
ungracious
to
one
to
whom
she
owes
so
great
a
weight
of
obligations
when
helen
asked
this
she
remembered
the
spleen
lady
mar
once
cherished
against
wallace
and
she
feared
it
might
now
be
revived
ungracious
o
no
the
reverse
of
that
but
her
gratitude
is
full
of
absurdity
i
will
not
repeat
the
fooleries
with
which
she
sought
to
detain
him
at
bute
and
that
some
new
fancy
respecting
him
is
now
about
to
menace
his
patience
i
am
convinced
for
on
my
way
hither
i
met
her
hurrying
along
and
as
she
passed
me
she
exclaimed
lord
buchan
arrived
i
answered
then
he
proclaimed
him
king
cried
she
and
into
the
great
gallery
she
darted
you
do
not
mean
to
say
demanded
helen
turning
her
eyes
with
an
expression
which
seemed
confident
of
his
answer
that
sir
william
wallace
has
accepted
the
crown
of
scotland
certainly
not
replied
edwin
but
as
certainly
it
has
been
offered
to
him
and
he
has
refused
it
i
could
have
sworn
it
returned
helen
rising
from
her
chair
all
is
loyal
all
is
great
and
consistent
there
edwin
he
is
indeed
the
perfect
exemplar
of
all
nobleness
rejoined
the
youth
and
i
believe
i
shall
even
love
you
better
my
dear
cousin
because
you
seem
to
have
so
clear
an
apprehension
of
his
real
character
he
then
proceeded
with
all
the
animation
of
the
most
zealous
affection
to
narrate
to
helen
the
particulars
of
the
late
scene
on
the
carse
of
stirling
and
while
he
deepened
still
more
the
profound
impression
the
virtues
of
wallace
had
made
on
her
heart
he
reopened
its
more
tender
sympathies
by
repeating
with
even
minuter
accuracy
than
he
had
done
to
his
mother
details
of
those
hours
which
he
passed
with
him
in
retirement
he
spoke
of
the
of
moonlight
walks
in
the
camp
when
all
but
the
sentinels
and
his
general
and
himself
were
sunk
in
sleep
these
were
the
seasons
when
the
suppressed
feelings
of
wallace
would
by
fits
break
from
his
lips
and
at
last
pour
themselves
out
unrestrainedly
to
the
ear
of
sympathy
as
the
young
narrator
described
all
the
endearing
qualities
of
his
friend
the
cheerful
heroism
with
which
he
quelled
every
tender
remembrance
to
do
his
duty
in
the
for
it
is
only
in
the
night
said
edwin
that
my
general
remembers
ellerslie
helen
tears
again
stole
silently
down
her
cheeks
edwin
perceived
them
and
throwing
his
arms
gently
around
her
weep
not
my
sweet
cousin
said
he
for
with
all
his
sorrow
i
never
saw
true
happiness
till
i
beheld
it
in
the
eyes
and
heard
it
in
the
voice
of
sir
william
wallace
he
has
talked
to
me
of
the
joy
he
should
experience
in
giving
liberty
to
scotland
and
establishing
her
peace
till
his
enthusiastic
soul
grasping
hope
as
if
it
were
possession
he
has
looked
on
me
with
a
consciousness
of
enjoyment
which
seemed
to
say
that
all
bliss
was
summed
up
in
a
patriot
breast
and
at
other
times
when
after
a
conversation
on
his
beloved
marion
a
few
natural
regrets
would
pass
his
lips
and
my
tears
tell
how
deep
was
my
sympathy
then
he
would
turn
to
comfort
me
then
he
would
show
me
the
world
beyond
this
that
world
which
is
the
aim
of
all
his
deeds
the
end
of
all
his
travails
and
lost
in
the
rapturous
idea
of
meeting
his
marion
there
a
foretaste
of
all
would
seem
to
seize
his
soul
and
were
i
then
called
upon
to
point
out
the
most
enviable
felicity
on
earth
i
should
say
it
is
that
of
sir
william
wallace
it
is
this
enthusiasm
in
all
he
believes
and
feels
that
makes
him
what
he
is
it
is
this
eternal
spirit
of
hope
infused
into
him
by
heaven
itself
that
makes
him
rise
from
sorrow
like
the
sun
from
a
cloud
brighter
and
with
more
ardent
beams
it
is
this
that
bathes
his
lips
in
the
smiles
of
paradise
that
throws
a
divine
luster
over
his
eyes
and
makes
all
dream
of
love
and
happiness
that
look
upon
him
edwin
paused
is
it
not
so
my
cousin
helen
raised
her
thoughtful
face
he
is
not
a
being
of
this
earth
edwin
we
must
learn
to
imitate
him
as
well
as
she
hesitated
then
added
as
well
as
to
revere
him
i
do
before
the
altars
of
the
saints
but
not
to
worship
said
she
interrupting
herself
that
would
be
a
crime
to
look
on
him
as
a
glorious
example
of
patient
suffering
of
invincible
courage
in
the
behalf
of
truth
and
mercy
this
is
the
end
of
my
reverence
for
him
and
this
sentiment
my
dear
edwin
you
partake
it
possesses
me
wholly
cried
the
energetic
youth
i
have
no
thought
no
wish
nor
ever
move
or
speak
but
with
the
intent
to
be
like
him
he
calls
me
his
brother
and
i
will
be
so
in
soul
though
i
can
not
in
blood
and
then
my
dear
helen
you
shall
have
two
sir
william
wallaces
to
love
sweetest
sweetest
boy
cried
helen
putting
her
quivering
lips
to
his
forehead
you
will
then
always
remember
that
helen
so
dearly
loves
scotland
as
to
be
jealous
above
all
earthly
things
for
the
lord
regent
safety
be
his
guardian
angel
beware
of
treason
in
man
and
woman
friend
and
kindred
it
lurks
my
cousin
under
the
most
specious
forms
and
as
one
mark
lord
buchan
in
short
have
a
care
of
all
whom
any
of
the
house
of
cummin
may
introduce
watch
over
your
general
life
in
the
private
hour
it
is
not
the
public
field
i
fear
for
him
his
valiant
arm
will
there
be
his
own
guard
but
in
the
unreserved
day
of
confidence
envy
will
point
its
dagger
and
then
be
as
eyes
to
his
too
trusting
soul
as
a
shield
to
his
too
confidently
exposed
breast
as
she
spoke
she
strove
to
conceal
her
too
eloquent
face
in
the
silken
ringlets
of
her
hair
i
will
be
all
this
cried
edwin
who
saw
nothing
in
her
tender
solicitude
but
the
ingenuous
affection
which
glowed
in
his
own
heart
and
i
will
be
your
eyes
too
my
cousin
for
when
i
am
absent
with
sir
william
wallace
i
shall
consider
myself
your
representative
and
so
will
send
you
regular
dispatches
of
all
that
happens
to
him
thanks
would
have
been
a
poor
means
of
imparting
what
she
felt
at
this
assurance
and
rising
from
her
seat
with
some
of
wallace
own
resigned
and
enthusiastic
expression
in
her
face
she
pressed
hand
to
her
heart
then
bowing
her
head
to
him
in
token
of
gratitude
withdrew
into
an
inner
apartment
chapter
xxxix
stirling
castle
and
council
hall
the
countess
chivalric
tribute
from
the
window
gave
wallace
reason
to
anticipate
her
company
in
his
visit
to
lady
ruthven
and
on
finding
the
room
vacant
he
dispatched
edwin
for
his
mother
that
he
might
not
be
distressed
by
the
unchecked
advances
of
a
woman
whom
as
the
wife
of
lord
mar
he
was
obliged
to
see
and
whose
weakness
he
pitied
as
she
belonged
to
a
sex
for
which
in
consideration
of
the
felicity
once
bestowed
on
him
by
woman
he
felt
a
peculiar
tenderness
respect
the
countess
he
could
not
nor
indeed
could
he
feel
any
gratitude
for
a
preference
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
no
foundations
in
the
only
true
basis
of
love
the
virtues
of
the
object
for
as
she
acted
against
every
moral
law
against
his
declared
sentiments
it
was
evident
that
she
placed
little
value
on
his
esteem
and
therefore
he
despised
while
he
pitied
a
human
creature
ungovernably
yielding
herself
to
the
sway
of
her
passions
in
the
midst
of
thoughts
so
little
to
her
advantage
lady
mar
entered
the
room
wallace
turned
to
meet
her
while
she
hastening
toward
him
and
dropping
on
one
knee
exclaimed
let
me
be
the
first
woman
in
scotland
to
acknowledge
its
king
wallace
put
forth
both
his
hands
to
raise
her
and
smiling
replied
lady
mar
you
would
do
me
an
honor
i
can
never
claim
how
cried
she
starting
up
what
then
was
that
cry
i
heard
did
they
not
call
you
and
did
not
my
lord
confused
disappointed
overpowered
she
left
the
sentence
unfinished
sunk
on
a
seat
and
burst
into
tears
at
that
moment
she
saw
her
anticipated
crown
fall
from
her
head
and
having
united
the
gaining
of
wallace
with
his
acquisition
of
this
dignity
all
her
hopes
seemed
again
the
sport
of
winds
she
felt
as
if
wallace
had
eluded
her
power
for
it
was
by
the
acts
of
her
kinsman
that
she
had
meant
to
bind
him
to
her
love
and
now
all
was
rejected
and
she
wept
in
despair
he
gazed
at
her
with
amazement
what
these
emotions
and
his
elevation
had
to
do
with
each
other
he
could
not
guess
but
recollecting
her
manner
of
mentioning
lord
buchan
name
he
answered
lord
buchan
i
have
just
seen
he
and
lord
march
came
upon
the
carse
at
the
time
i
went
thither
to
meet
my
gallant
countrymen
and
these
two
noblemen
though
so
lately
the
friends
of
edward
united
with
the
rest
in
proclaiming
me
regent
this
word
dried
the
tears
of
lady
mar
she
saw
the
shadow
of
royalty
behind
it
and
summoning
artifice
to
conceal
the
joy
of
her
heart
she
calmly
said
do
not
too
severely
condemn
this
weakness
it
is
not
that
of
vain
wishes
for
your
aggrandizement
you
are
the
same
to
joanna
mar
whether
as
a
monarch
or
a
private
man
so
long
as
you
possess
that
supremacy
in
all
excellence
which
first
gained
her
esteem
it
is
for
scotland
sake
alone
that
i
wish
you
to
be
her
king
you
have
taught
me
to
forget
all
selfish
desires
to
respect
myself
cried
she
and
from
this
hour
i
conjure
you
to
wipe
from
your
memory
all
my
folly
all
my
with
the
last
word
her
bosom
heaved
tumultuously
and
she
rose
in
agitation
wallace
now
gazed
on
her
with
redoubled
wonder
she
saw
it
and
hearing
a
foot
in
the
passage
turned
and
grasping
his
hand
said
in
a
soft
and
hurried
tone
forgive
that
which
is
entwined
with
my
heart
should
cost
me
some
pangs
to
wrest
thence
again
only
respect
me
and
i
am
comforted
wallace
in
silence
pressed
her
hand
and
the
door
opened
lady
ruthven
entered
the
countess
whose
present
aim
was
to
throw
the
virtue
of
wallace
off
its
guard
and
to
take
that
by
sap
which
she
found
resisted
open
attack
with
a
penitential
air
disappeared
by
another
passage
edwin
gentle
mother
was
followed
by
the
same
youth
who
had
brought
helen
packet
to
berwick
it
was
walter
hay
anxious
to
be
recognized
by
his
benefactor
to
whom
his
recovered
health
had
rendered
his
person
strange
wallace
received
him
with
kindness
and
told
him
to
bear
his
grateful
respects
to
his
lady
for
her
care
of
her
charge
lord
ruthven
with
others
soon
entered
and
at
the
appointed
hour
they
attended
their
chief
to
the
citadel
the
was
already
filled
with
the
lords
who
had
brought
their
clans
to
the
scottish
standard
on
the
entrance
of
wallace
they
rose
and
mar
coming
forward
followed
by
the
heralds
and
other
officers
of
ceremony
saluted
him
with
the
due
forms
of
regent
and
led
him
to
the
throne
wallace
ascended
but
it
was
only
to
take
thence
a
packet
which
had
been
deposited
for
him
on
its
cushion
and
coming
down
again
he
laid
the
parchment
on
the
i
can
do
all
things
best
said
he
when
i
am
upon
a
level
with
my
friends
he
then
broke
the
seal
of
the
packet
it
was
from
the
prince
of
wales
agreeing
to
wallace
proposed
exchange
of
prisoners
but
denouncing
him
as
the
instigator
of
the
rebellion
and
threatening
him
with
a
future
judgment
from
his
incensed
king
for
the
mischief
he
had
wrought
in
the
realm
of
scotland
the
letter
was
finished
with
a
demand
that
the
town
and
citadel
of
berwick
should
be
surrendered
to
england
as
a
gauge
for
the
quiet
of
the
borders
till
edward
should
return
kirkpatrick
scoffed
at
the
audacious
menace
of
the
young
prince
he
should
come
amongst
us
like
a
man
cried
he
and
we
would
soon
show
him
who
it
is
that
works
mischief
in
scotland
ay
even
on
his
back
we
would
write
the
chastisement
due
to
the
offender
be
not
angry
with
him
my
friend
returned
wallace
these
threats
are
words
of
course
from
the
son
of
edward
did
he
not
fear
both
our
rights
and
our
arms
he
would
not
so
readily
accord
with
our
propositions
you
see
every
scottish
prisoner
is
to
be
on
the
borders
by
a
certain
day
and
to
satisfy
that
impatient
valor
which
i
your
friend
would
never
check
but
when
it
loses
itself
in
a
furor
too
nearly
resembling
that
of
our
enemies
i
intend
to
make
your
prowess
once
again
the
theme
of
their
discourse
you
will
retake
your
castles
in
annandale
give
me
but
the
means
to
recover
those
stout
gates
of
our
country
cried
kirkpatrick
and
i
will
warrant
you
to
keep
the
keys
in
my
hand
till
doomsday
wallace
resumed
three
thousand
men
are
at
your
command
when
the
prisoners
pass
each
other
on
the
cheviots
the
armistice
will
terminate
you
may
then
fall
back
upon
annandale
and
that
night
light
your
own
fires
in
torthorald
send
the
expelled
garrison
into
northumberland
and
show
this
haughty
prince
that
we
know
how
to
replenish
his
depopulated
towns
but
first
i
will
set
my
mark
on
them
cried
kirkpatrick
with
one
of
those
laughs
which
ever
preluded
some
savage
proposal
i
can
guess
it
would
be
no
gentle
one
returned
wallace
why
brave
knight
will
you
ever
sully
the
fair
field
of
your
fame
with
an
ensanguined
tide
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
times
replied
kirkpatrick
roughly
you
only
my
victorious
general
who
perhaps
had
most
cause
to
go
with
the
stream
have
chosen
a
path
of
your
own
but
look
around
see
our
burns
which
the
southrons
made
run
with
scottish
blood
our
hillocks
swollen
with
the
cairns
of
our
slain
the
highways
blocked
up
with
the
graves
of
the
murdered
our
lands
filled
with
maimed
clansmen
who
purchased
life
of
our
ruthless
tyrants
by
the
loss
of
eyes
and
limbs
and
shall
we
talk
of
gentle
methods
with
the
perpetrators
of
these
horrors
sir
william
wallace
you
would
make
women
of
us
shame
shame
kirkpatrick
resounded
from
every
voice
you
insult
the
regent
kirkpatrick
stood
proudly
frowning
with
his
left
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
wallace
by
a
motion
hushed
the
tumult
and
spoke
no
true
chief
of
scotland
can
offer
me
greater
respect
than
frankly
to
trust
me
with
his
sentiments
though
we
disagree
in
some
points
cried
kirkpatrick
i
am
ready
to
die
for
him
at
any
time
for
i
believe
a
trustier
scot
treads
not
the
earth
but
i
repeat
why
by
this
mincing
mercy
seek
to
turn
our
soldiers
into
women
i
seek
to
make
them
men
replied
wallace
to
be
aware
that
they
fight
with
with
whom
they
may
one
day
be
friends
and
not
like
the
furious
savages
of
old
scandinavia
drink
the
blood
of
eternal
enmity
i
would
neither
have
my
chieftains
set
examples
of
cruelty
nor
degrade
themselves
by
imitating
the
barbarities
of
our
enemies
that
scotland
bleeds
every
pore
is
true
but
let
peace
be
our
aim
and
we
shall
heal
all
her
wounds
then
i
am
not
to
cut
off
the
ears
of
the
freebooters
in
annandale
cried
kirkpatrick
with
a
smile
have
it
as
you
will
my
general
only
you
must
new
christen
me
to
wash
the
from
my
hand
the
rite
of
my
infancy
was
performed
as
became
a
soldier
son
my
fount

and
the
first
pap
i
sucked
lay
on
the
point
of
his
sword
you
have
not
shamed
your
nurse
cried
murray
nor
will
i
answered
kirkpatrick
while
the
arm
that
slew
cressingham
remains
unwithered
while
he
spoke
ker
entered
to
ask
permission
to
introduce
a
messenger
from
earl
de
warenne
wallace
gave
consent
it
was
sir
hugh
le
de
spencer
a
near
kinsman
of
the
earl
of
hereford
the
tumultory
constable
of
england
he
was
the
envoy
who
had
brought
the
prince
of
wales
dispatches
to
stirling
wallace
was
standing
when
he
entered
and
so
were
the
chieftains
but
at
his
appearance
they
sat
down
wallace
retained
his
position
i
come
cried
the
southron
knight
from
the
lord
warden
of
scotland
who
like
my
prince
too
greatly
condescends
to
do
otherwise
than
command
where
now
he
treats
i
come
to
the
leader
of
this
rebellion
william
wallace
to
receive
an
answer
to
the
terms
granted
by
the
clemency
of
my
master
the
son
of
his
liege
lord
to
this
misled
kingdom
sir
knight
replied
sir
william
wallace
when
the
southron
lords
delegate
a
messenger
to
me
who
knows
how
to
respect
the
representative
of
the
nation
to
which
he
is
sent
and
the
agents
of
his
own
country
i
shall
give
them
my
reply
you
may
withdraw
the
southron
stood
resolute
to
remain
where
he
was
do
you
know
proud
scot
cried
he
to
whom
you
dare
address
this
imperious
language
i
am
the
nephew
of
the
lord
high
constable
of
england
it
is
a
pity
cried
murray
looking
coolly
up
from
the
table
that
he
is
not
here
to
take
his
kinsman
into
custody
le
de
spencer
fiercely
half
drew
his
sword
sir
this
must
be
put
up
with
cried
wallace
interrupting
him
and
motioning
edwin
to
lay
his
hand
on
the
sword
you
have
insulted
the
nation
to
which
you
were
sent
on
a
peaceful
errand
and
having
thus
invited
the
resentment
of
every
chief
here
present
you
can
not
justly
complain
against
their
indignation
but
in
consideration
of
your
youth
and
probable
ignorance
of
what
becomes
the
character
of
an
embassador
i
grant
you
the
protection
your
behavior
has
forfeited
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
said
he
turning
to
him
you
will
guard
sir
hugh
le
de
spencer
to
the
earl
de
warenne
and
tell
that
nobleman
i
am
ready
to
answer
any
proper
messenger
the
young
southron
frowning
followed
scrymgeour
from
the
hall
and
wallace
turning
to
murray
my
friend
said
he
it
is
not
well
to
stimulate
insolence
by
repartee
this
young
man
speech
though
an
insult
to
the
nation
was
directed
to
me
and
by
me
only
it
ought
to
have
been
answered
and
that
seriously
the
haughty
spirit
of
this
man
should
have
been
quelled
not
incensed
and
had
you
proceeded
one
word
further
you
would
have
given
him
an
apparently
just
cause
of
complaint
against
you
and
of
that
my
friend
i
am
most
sensibly
jealous
it
is
not
policy
nor
virtue
to
be
rigorous
to
the
extent
of
justice
i
know
returned
murray
blushing
that
my
wits
are
too
many
for
me
ever
throwing
me
like
phaeton
horses
into
the
midst
of
some
fiery
mischief
but
pardon
me
now
and
i
promise
to
rein
them
close
when
next
i
see
this
prancing
knight
bravo
my
lord
andrew
cried
kirkpatrick
in
an
affected
whisper
i
am
not
always
to
be
bird
alone
under
the
whip
of
our
regent
you
have
had
a
few
stripes
and
now
look
a
little
of
my
feather
like
as
a
swan
to
a
vulture
good
roger
answered
murray
wallace
attended
not
to
this
tilting
of
humor
between
the
chieftains
but
engaged
himself
in
close
discourse
with
the
elder
nobles
at
the
higher
end
of
the
hall
in
half
an
hour
scrymgeour
returned
and
with
him
baron
hilton
he
brought
an
apology
from
de
warenne
for
the
behavior
of
his
embassador
and
added
his
persuasions
to
the
demands
of
england
that
the
regent
would
surrender
berwick
not
only
as
a
pledge
for
the
scots
keeping
the
truce
on
the
borders
but
as
a
proof
of
his
confidence
in
prince
edward
wallace
answered
that
he
had
no
reason
to
show
extraordinary
confidence
in
one
who
manifested
by
such
a
requisition
that
he
had
no
faith
in
scotland
and
therefore
neither
as
a
proof
of
confidence
nor
as
a
gauge
of
her
word
should
scotland
a
victorious
power
surrender
the
eastern
door
of
her
kingdom
in
the
vanquished
wallace
declared
himself
ready
to
dismiss
the
english
prisoners
to
the
frontiers
and
to
maintain
the
armistice
till
they
had
reached
the
south
side
of
the
cheviots
but
added
he
my
word
must
be
my
bond
for
by
the
honor
of
scotland
i
will
give
no
other
then
answered
baron
hilton
with
an
honest
flush
passing
over
his
cheek
as
if
ashamed
of
what
he
had
next
to
say
i
am
constrained
to
lay
before
you
the
last
instructions
of
the
prince
of
wales
to
earl
de
warenne
he
took
a
royally
sealed
roll
of
vellum
from
his
breast
and
read
aloud
thus
saith
edward
prince
of
wales
to
earl
de
warenne
lord
warden
of
scotland
if
that
william
wallace
who
now
assumeth
to
himself
the
rule
of
all
our
royal
father
hereditary
dominions
north
of
the
cheviots
refuseth
to
give
unto
us
the
whole
possession
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
as
a
pledge
of
his
faith
to
keep
the
armistice
on
the
borders
from
sea
to
sea
we
command
you
to
tell
him
that
we
shall
detain
under
the
ward
of
our
good
lieutenant
of
the
tower
in
london
the
person
of
william
the
lord
douglas
as
a
close
captive
until
our
prisoners
now
in
scotland
arrive
safely
at
this
mark
of
supremacy
over
a
rebellious
people
we
owe
as
a
pledge
of
their
homage
to
our
royal
father
and
as
a
tribute
of
our
gratitude
to
him
for
having
allowed
us
to
treat
at
all
with
so
undutiful
a
part
of
his
dominions
signed
edward
baron
cried
wallace
it
would
be
beneath
the
dignity
of
scotland
to
retaliate
this
act
with
the
like
conduct
the
exchange
of
prisoners
shall
yet
be
made
and
the
armistice
held
sacred
on
the
borders
but
as
i
hold
the
door
of
war
open
in
the
interior
of
the
country
before
the
earl
de
warenne
leaves
this
citadel
and
it
shall
be
on
the
day
assigned
please
the
almighty
lord
of
justice
the
southron
usurpers
of
all
our
castles
on
the
eastern
shore
shall
be
our
hostages
for
the
safety
of
lord
douglas
and
this
is
my
answer
noble
wallace
it
is
and
you
see
no
more
of
me
till
that
which
i
have
said
is
done
baron
hilton
withdrew
and
wallace
turning
to
his
peers
rapidly
made
dispositions
for
a
sweeping
march
from
frith
to
frith
and
having
sent
those
who
were
to
accompany
him
to
prepare
for
departure
next
day
at
dawn
he
retired
with
the
lords
mar
and
bothwell
to
arrange
affairs
relative
to
the
prisoners
chapter
xl
the
governor
apartments
the
sun
rose
on
wallace
and
his
brave
legions
as
they
traversed
the
once
romantic
glades
of
strathmore
but
now
the
scene
was
changed
the
villages
were
abandoned
and
the
land
lay
around
in
uncultivated
wastes
sheep
without
a
shepherd
fled
wild
from
the
approach
of
man
and
wolves
issued
howling
from
the
cloisters
of
depopulated
monasteries
the
army
approached
dumblane
but
it
was
without
inhabitant
grass
grew
in
the
streets
and
the
birds
which
roosted
in
the
desert
dwellings
flew
scared
from
the
windows
as
the
trumpet
of
wallace
sounded
through
the
town
loud
echoes
repeated
the
summons
from
its
hollow
walls
but
no
other
voice
was
heard
no
human
face
appeared
for
the
ravening
hand
of
cressingham
had
been
there
wallace
sighed
as
he
looked
around
him
rather
smile
cried
graham
that
heaven
hath
given
you
the
power
to
say
to
the
tyrants
who
have
done
this
shall
your
proud
waves
be
stayed
they
proceeded
over
many
a
hill
and
plain
and
found
that
the
same
withering
touch
of
desolation
had
burned
up
and
overwhelmed
the
country
wallace
saw
that
his
troops
were
faint
for
want
of
food
cheering
them
he
promised
that
ormsby
should
provide
them
a
feast
in
perth
and
with
reawakened
spirits
they
took
the
river
tay
at
its
fords
and
were
soon
before
the
walls
of
that
city
but
it
was
governed
by
a
coward
and
ormsby
fled
to
dundee
at
the
first
sight
of
the
scottish
army
his
flight
might
have
warranted
the
garrison
to
surrender
without
a
blow
but
a
braver
man
being
his
lieutenant
sharp
was
the
conflict
before
wallace
could
compel
that
officer
to
abandon
the
ramparts
and
to
sue
for
the
very
terms
he
had
at
first
rejected
after
the
fall
of
perth
the
young
regent
made
a
rapid
progress
through
that
part
of
the
country
driving
the
southron
garrisons
out
of
scone
and
all
the
embattled
towns
expelling
them
from
the
castles
of
kincain
elcho
kinfauns
and
doune
and
then
proceeding
to
the
marine
fortresses
those
avenues
by
which
the
ships
of
england
had
poured
its
legions
on
the
eastern
coast
he
compelled
dundee
cupar
glamis
montrose
and
aberdeen
all
to
acknowledge
the
power
of
his
arms
he
seized
most
of
the
english
ships
in
those
ports
and
manning
them
with
scots
soon
cleared
the
seas
of
the
vessels
which
had
escaped
taking
some
and
putting
others
to
flight
and
one
of
the
latter
was
the
fugitive
ormsby
this
enterprise
achieved
wallace
with
a
host
of
prisoners
turned
his
steps
toward
the
forth
but
ere
he
left
the
banks
of
the
tay
and
dee
he
detached
three
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
lord
ruthven
giving
him
a
commission
to
range
the
country
from
the
carse
of
gowrie
to
remotest
sutherland
and
in
all
that
tract
reduce
every
town
and
castle
which
had
admitted
a
southron
garrison
wallace
took
leave
of
lord
ruthven
at
huntingtower
and
that
worthy
nobleman
when
he
assumed
with
the
government
of
perth
this
extensive
command
said
as
he
grasped
the
regent
hand
i
say
not
bravest
of
scots
what
is
my
gratitude
for
thus
making
me
an
arm
of
my
country
but
deeds
will
show
he
then
bade
a
father
adieu
to
his
son
counseling
him
to
regard
wallace
as
the
light
in
his
path
and
embracing
him
they
parted
a
rapid
march
round
by
fifeshire
through
which
victory
followed
their
steps
brought
the
conqueror
and
his
troops
again
within
sight
of
the
towers
of
stirling
it
was
on
the
eve
of
the
day
on
which
he
had
promised
earl
de
warenne
should
see
the
english
prisoners
depart
for
the
borders
no
doubt
of
his
arriving
at
the
appointed
time
was
entertained
by
the
scots
or
by
the
southrons
in
the
castle
the
one
knew
the
sacredness
of
his
word
and
the
other
having
felt
his
prowess
would
not
so
far
disparage
their
own
as
to
suppose
that
any
could
withstand
him
by
whom
they
were
beaten
de
warenne
as
he
stood
on
the
battlements
of
the
keep
beheld
from
afar
the
long
line
of
scottish
soldiers
as
they
descended
the
ochil
hills
when
he
pointed
it
out
to
de
valence
that
nobleman
who
in
proportion
as
he
wished
to
check
the
arms
of
wallace
had
flattered
himself
that
it
might
happen
against
the
evidence
of
his
eyesight
contradicted
the
observation
of
the
veteran
earl
your
sight
deceives
you
said
he
it
is
only
the
sunbeams
playing
on
the
cliffs
then
those
cliffs
are
moving
ones
cried
de
warenne
which
i
fear
have
ground
our
countrymen
on
the
coast
to
powder
we
shall
find
wallace
here
by
sunset
to
show
us
how
he
has
resented
the
affront
our
prince
cast
on
his
jealous
honor
his
honor
returned
de
valence
is
like
that
of
his
countrymen
an
enemy
alike
to
his
own
interest
and
to
that
of
others
had
it
allowed
him
to
accept
the
crown
of
scotland
and
so
have
fought
edward
with
the
concentrating
arm
of
a
king
or
would
he
even
now
offer
peace
to
our
sovereign
granting
his
prerogative
as
liege
lord
of
the
country
all
might
go
well
but
as
the
honor
you
speak
of
prevents
his
using
these
means
of
ending
the
contest
destruction
must
close
his
career
and
what
quarrel
demanded
de
warenne
can
you
my
lord
de
valence
have
against
this
nice
honor
of
sir
william
wallace
since
you
allow
it
secures
the
final
success
of
our
cause
his
honor
and
himself
are
hateful
to
me
impatiently
answered
de
valence
he
crosses
me
in
my
wishes
public
and
private
and
for
the
sake
of
my
king
and
myself
i
might
almost
be
he
turned
pale
as
he
spoke
and
met
the
penetrating
glance
of
de
warenne
he
paused
tempted
to
what
asked
de
warenne
to
a
brutus
mode
of
ridding
the
state
of
an
enemy
that
might
be
noble
in
a
roman
citizen
returned
de
warenne
which
would
be
villainous
in
an
english
lord
treated
as
you
have
been
by
a
generous
victor
not
the
usurper
of
any
country
liberties
but
rather
a
brutus
in
defense
of
his
own
which
man
of
us
all
from
the
general
to
the
meanest
follower
in
our
camps
has
he
injured
lord
aymer
frowned
did
he
not
expose
me
threaten
me
with
an
ignominious
death
on
the
walls
of
stirling
but
was
it
before
he
saw
the
earl
of
mar
with
his
hapless
family
brought
with
halters
on
their
necks
to
be
suspended
from
this
very
tower
ah
what
a
tale
has
the
lovely
countess
told
me
of
that
direful
scene
what
he
then
did
was
to
check
the
sanguinary
cressingham
from
imbruiting
his
hands
in
the
blood
of
female
and
infant
innocence
i
care
not
cried
de
valence
what
are
or
are
not
the
offenses
of
this
domineering
wallace
but
i
hate
him
and
my
respect
for
his
advocates
can
not
but
correspond
with
that
feeling
as
he
spoke
that
he
might
not
be
further
molested
by
the
arguments
of
de
warenne
he
abruptly
turned
away
and
left
the
battlements
pride
would
not
allow
the
enraged
earl
to
confess
his
private
reasons
for
this
vehement
enmity
against
the
scottish
chief
a
conference
which
he
had
held
the
preceding
evening
with
lord
mar
was
the
cause
of
this
augmented
hatred
and
from
that
moment
the
haughty
southron
vowed
the
destruction
of
wallace
by
open
attack
or
secret
treachery
ambition
and
the
base
counterfeit
of
love
those
two
master
passions
in
untempered
minds
were
the
springs
of
this
antipathy
the
instant
in
which
he
knew
that
the
young
creature
whom
at
a
distance
he
discerned
clinging
around
the
earl
of
mar
neck
in
the
streets
of
stirling
was
the
same
lady
helen
on
whose
account
lord
soulis
had
poured
on
him
such
undeserved
invectives
in
bothwell
castle
curious
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
one
whose
transcendent
beauty
he
had
often
heard
celebrated
by
others
he
ordered
her
to
be
immediately
conveyed
to
his
apartments
in
the
citadel
on
their
first
interview
he
was
more
struck
by
her
personal
charms
than
he
had
ever
been
with
any
woman
although
few
were
so
noted
for
gallantry
in
the
english
court
as
himself
he
could
hardly
understand
the
nature
of
his
feelings
while
discoursing
with
her
to
all
others
of
her
sex
he
had
declared
his
enamored
wishes
with
as
much
ease
as
vivacity
but
when
he
looked
on
helen
the
admiration
her
loveliness
inspired
was
checked
by
an
indescribable
awe
no
word
of
passion
escaped
his
lips
he
sought
to
win
her
by
a
deportment
consonant
with
her
own
dignity
of
manner
and
obeyed
all
her
wishes
excepting
when
they
pointed
to
any
communication
with
her
parents
he
feared
the
wary
eyes
of
the
earl
of
mar
but
nothing
of
this
reverence
of
helen
was
grounded
on
any
principle
within
the
heart
of
de
valence
his
idea
of
virtue
was
so
erroneous
that
he
believed
by
the
short
assumption
of
its
semblance
he
might
so
steal
on
the
confidence
of
his
victim
as
to
induce
her
to
forget
all
the
world
nay
heaven
itself
in
his
sophistry
and
blandishments
to
facilitate
this
end
he
at
first
designed
to
precipitate
the
condemnation
of
the
earl
that
he
might
be
rid
of
a
father
existence
holding
in
dread
of
his
censure
the
perhaps
otherwise
yielding
heart
of
his
lovely
intended
mistress
the
unprincipled
and
impure
can
have
no
idea
what
virtue
or
delicacy
are
other
than
vestments
of
disguise
or
of
ornament
to
be
thrown
off
at
will
and
therefore
to
reason
with
such
minds
is
to
talk
to
the
winds
to
tell
a
man
who
is
born
blind
to
decide
between
two
colors
in
short
a
libertine
heart
is
the
same
in
all
ages
of
the
world
de
valence
therefore
seeing
the
anguish
of
her
fears
for
her
father
and
hearing
the
fervor
with
which
she
implored
for
his
life
adopted
the
plan
of
granting
the
earl
reprieves
from
day
to
day
and
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
cressingham
he
intended
after
having
worked
upon
the
terrors
of
helen
to
grant
to
her
her
father
release
on
condition
of
her
yielding
herself
to
be
his
he
had
even
meditated
that
the
accomplishment
of
this
device
should
have
taken
place
the
very
night
in
which
wallace
first
appearance
before
stirling
had
called
its
garrison
to
arms
impelled
by
vengeance
against
the
man
who
had
driven
him
from
dumbarton
and
from
ayr
and
irritated
at
being
delayed
in
the
moment
when
his
passion
was
to
seize
its
object
de
valence
thought
to
end
all
by
a
coup
de
main
and
rushing
out
of
the
gates
was
taken
prisoner
such
was
the
situation
of
things
when
wallace
first
became
master
of
the
place
now
when
the
whole
of
the
english
army
were
in
the
same
captivity
with
himself
when
he
saw
the
lately
proscribed
lord
mar
governor
of
stirling
and
that
the
scottish
cause
seemed
triumphant
on
every
side
de
valence
changed
his
former
illicit
views
on
helen
and
bethought
him
of
making
her
his
wife
ambition
as
well
as
love
impelled
him
to
this
resolution
and
he
foresaw
that
the
vast
influence
which
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
mar
must
give
him
in
the
country
would
be
a
decisive
argument
with
the
king
of
england
to
this
purpose
not
doubting
the
scottish
earl
acceptance
of
such
a
on
the
very
day
that
wallace
marched
toward
the
coast
de
valence
sent
to
request
an
hour
private
audience
of
lord
mar
he
could
not
then
grant
it
but
at
noon
next
day
they
met
in
the
governor
apartments
the
southron
without
much
preface
opened
his
wishes
and
proffered
his
hand
for
the
lady
helen
i
make
her
the
proudest
lady
in
great
britain
continued
he
for
she
shall
have
a
court
in
my
welsh
province
little
inferior
to
that
of
edward
queen
pomp
would
have
no
sway
with
my
daughter
replied
the
earl
it
is
the
princely
mind
she
values
not
its
pagentry
whomsoever
she
prefers
the
tribute
will
be
paid
to
the
merit
of
the
object
not
to
his
rank
and
therefore
earl
should
it
be
you
the
greater
will
be
your
pledge
of
happiness
i
shall
repeat
to
her
what
you
have
said
and
deliver
her
answer
not
deeming
it
possible
that
it
should
be
otherwise
than
favorable
de
valence
allowed
his
imagination
to
roam
over
every
anticipated
delight
he
exulted
in
the
pride
with
which
he
would
show
this
perfection
of
northern
beauty
to
the
fair
of
england
how
would
the
simple
graces
of
her
seraphic
form
which
looked
more
like
a
being
of
air
than
of
earth
put
to
shame
the
labored
beauties
of
the
court
and
then
it
was
not
only
the
artless
charms
of
a
he
would
present
to
the
wondering
throng
but
a
being
whose
majesty
of
soul
proclaimed
her
high
descent
and
peerless
virtues
how
did
he
congratulate
himself
in
contemplating
this
unsullied
temple
of
virgin
innocence
that
he
had
never
by
even
the
vapor
of
one
impassioned
sigh
contaminated
her
pure
ear
or
broken
the
magic
spell
which
seemed
fated
to
crown
him
with
happiness
unknown
with
honor
unexampled
to
be
so
blessed
so
distinguished
so
envied
was
to
him
a
dream
of
triumph
that
wafted
away
all
remembrance
of
his
late
defeat
and
he
believed
in
taking
helen
from
scotland
he
should
bear
away
a
richer
prize
than
any
he
could
leave
behind
full
of
these
anticipations
he
attended
the
governor
of
stirling
the
next
day
to
hear
his
daughter
answer
but
unwilling
to
give
the
earl
that
advantage
over
him
which
a
knowledge
of
his
views
in
the
matter
might
occasion
he
affected
a
composure
he
did
not
feel
and
with
a
lofty
air
entered
the
room
as
if
he
were
come
rather
to
confer
than
to
beg
a
favor
this
deportment
did
not
lessen
the
satisfaction
with
which
the
brave
scot
opened
his
mission
my
lord
i
have
just
seen
my
daughter
she
duly
appreciates
the
honor
you
would
confer
on
her
she
is
grateful
for
all
your
courtesies
whilst
she
was
your
prisoner
but
beyond
that
sentiment
her
heart
attached
to
her
native
land
can
not
sympathize
with
your
wishes
de
valence
started
he
did
not
expect
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
denial
but
supposing
that
perhaps
a
little
of
his
own
art
was
tried
by
the
father
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
daughter
yielding
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
affecting
chagrin
at
a
disappointment
which
he
did
not
believe
was
seriously
intended
exclaimed
with
vehemence
surely
lord
mar
this
is
not
meant
as
a
refusal
i
can
not
receive
it
as
such
for
i
know
lady
helen
gentleness
i
know
the
sweet
tenderness
of
her
nature
would
plead
for
me
were
she
to
see
me
at
her
feet
and
hear
me
pour
forth
the
most
ardent
passion
that
ever
burned
in
a
human
breast
oh
my
gracious
lord
if
it
be
her
attachment
to
scotland
which
alone
militates
against
me
i
will
promise
that
her
time
shall
be
passed
between
the
two
countries
her
marriage
with
me
may
facilitate
that
peace
with
england
which
must
be
the
wish
of
us
all
and
perhaps
the
lord
wardenship
which
de
warenne
now
holds
may
be
transferred
to
me
i
have
reasons
for
expecting
that
it
will
be
so
and
then
she
as
a
queen
in
scotland
and
you
as
her
father
may
claim
every
distinction
from
her
fond
husband
every
indulgence
for
the
scots
which
your
patriot
heart
can
dictate
this
would
be
a
certain
benefit
to
scotland
while
the
ignis
fatuus
you
are
now
following
however
brilliant
may
be
its
career
during
edward
absence
must
on
his
return
be
extinguished
in
disaster
and
infamy
the
silence
of
the
earl
of
mar
who
willing
to
hear
all
that
was
in
the
mind
of
de
valence
had
let
him
proceed
uninterrupted
encouraged
the
southron
lord
to
say
more
than
he
had
at
first
intended
to
reveal
but
when
he
made
a
pause
and
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
the
earl
spoke
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
honor
you
would
bestow
upon
my
daughter
and
myself
by
your
alliance
but
as
i
have
said
before
her
heart
is
too
devoted
to
scotland
to
marry
any
man
whose
birth
does
not
make
it
his
duty
to
prefer
the
liberty
of
her
native
land
even
before
his
love
for
her
that
hope
to
see
our
country
freed
from
a
yoke
unjustly
laid
upon
her
that
hope
which
you
not
considering
our
rights
or
weighing
the
power
that
lies
in
a
just
cause
denominate
an
ignis
fatuus
is
the
only
passion
i
believe
that
lives
in
the
gentle
bosom
of
my
helen
and
therefore
noble
earl
not
even
your
offers
can
equal
the
measure
of
her
wishes
at
this
speech
de
valence
bit
his
lip
with
real
disappointment
and
starting
from
his
chair
now
in
unaffected
disorder
i
am
not
to
be
deceived
lord
mar
cried
he
i
am
not
to
be
cajoled
by
the
pretended
patriotism
of
your
daughter
i
know
the
sex
too
well
to
be
cheated
with
these
excuses
the
ignis
fatuus
that
leads
your
daughter
from
my
arms
is
not
the
freedom
of
scotland
but
the
handsome
rebel
who
conquers
in
its
name
he
is
now
fortune
minion
but
he
will
fall
lord
mar
and
then
what
will
be
the
fate
of
his
mad
adherents
earl
de
valence
replied
the
veteran
sixty
winters
have
checked
the
tides
of
passion
in
my
veins
but
the
indignation
of
my
soul
against
any
insult
offered
to
my
daughter
delicacy
or
to
the
name
of
the
lord
regent
of
scotland
is
not
less
powerful
in
my
breast
you
are
my
prisoner
and
i
pardon
what
i
could
so
easily
avenge
i
will
even
answer
you
and
say
that
i
do
not
know
of
any
exclusive
affection
subsisting
between
my
daughter
and
sir
william
wallace
but
this
i
am
assured
of
that
were
it
the
case
she
would
be
more
ennobled
in
being
the
wife
of
so
true
a
patriot
and
so
virtuous
a
man
than
were
she
advanced
to
the
bosom
of
an
emperor
and
for
myself
were
he
hurled
by
a
mysterious
providence
from
his
present
elevation
i
should
glory
in
my
son
were
he
such
and
would
think
him
as
great
on
a
scaffold
as
on
a
throne
it
is
well
that
is
your
opinion
replied
de
valence
stopping
in
his
wrathful
strides
and
turning
on
mar
with
vengeful
irony
cherish
these
heroics
for
you
will
assuredly
see
him
so
exalted
then
where
will
be
his
triumphs
over
edward
arms
and
pembroke
heart
where
your
daughter
patriot
husband
you
glorious
son
start
not
old
man
for
by
all
the
powers
of
hell
i
swear
that
some
eyes
which
now
look
proudly
on
the
southron
host
shall
close
in
blood
i
announce
a
fact
if
you
do
replied
mar
shuddering
at
the
demoniac
fire
that
lightened
from
the
countenance
of
de
valence
it
must
be
by
the
agency
of
devils
and
their
minister
vindictive
earl
will
meet
the
vengeance
of
the
eternal
arm
these
dreams
cried
de
valence
can
not
terrify
me
you
are
neither
a
seer
nor
i
a
fool
to
be
taken
by
such
prophecies
but
were
you
wise
enough
to
embrace
the
advantage
i
offer
you
might
be
a
prophet
of
good
greater
than
he
of
ercildown
to
your
nation
for
all
that
you
could
promise
i
would
take
care
should
be
fulfilled
but
you
cast
from
you
your
peace
and
safety
my
vengeance
shall
therefore
take
its
course
i
rely
not
on
oracles
of
heaven
or
hell
but
i
have
pronounced
the
doom
of
my
enemies
and
though
you
now
see
me
a
prisoner
tremble
haughty
scot
at
the
resentment
which
lies
in
this
head
and
heart
this
arm
perhaps
needs
not
the
armies
of
edward
to
pierce
you
in
your
boast
he
left
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
lord
mar
shaking
his
venerable
head
as
he
disappeared
said
to
himself
impotent
rage
of
passion
and
of
youth
i
pity
and
forgive
you
it
was
not
therefore
so
extraordinary
that
de
valence
when
he
saw
wallace
descending
the
ochil
hills
with
the
flying
banners
of
new
victories
should
break
into
curses
of
his
fortune
and
swear
inwardly
the
most
determined
revenge
fuel
was
added
to
this
fire
at
sunset
when
the
almost
measureless
defiles
of
prisoners
marshaled
before
the
ramparts
of
stirling
and
taking
the
usual
oath
to
wallace
met
his
view
we
quit
these
dishonoring
wall
cried
he
to
himself
but
ere
i
leave
them
if
there
be
power
in
gold
or
strength
in
my
arm
he
shall
die

into
the
citadel

on
the
evening
preceding
the
day
he
had
promised
should
see
the
english
lords
depart
for
their
country
de

as
a
mark
of
respect
to
a
man
whom
he
could
not
but
regard
with
admiration
went
to

to
bid
him
welcome

appeared
and
as
the
cavalcade
of
noble
southrons
who
had
lately
commanded
beyond

followed
him
murray
glanced
his
eye
around
and
said
with
a
smile
to
de
warenne
you
see
sir
earl
how
we
scots
keep
our
word
and
then
he
added
you
leave
stirling
but
these
remain
till
lord
douglas
opens
their
i
can
not
but
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
your
determination
returned
de
warenne
and
to
comfort
these
gentlemen
under
their
captivity
i
can
only
tell
them
that
if
anything
can
reconcile
them
to
the
loss
of
liberty
it
is
being
the
prisoners
of
sir
william
wallace
after
having
transferred
his
captives
to
the
charge
of
lord
mar
wallace
went
alone
to
the
chamber
of
montgomery
to
see
whether
the
state
of
his
wounds
would
allow
him
to
march
on
the
morrow
while
he
was
yet
there
an
invitation
arrived
from
the
countess
of
mar
requesting
his
presence
at
an
entertainment
which
by
her
consent
she
meant
to
give
that
night
at
snawdoun
to
the
southron
lords
before
their
departure
for
england
i
fear
you
dare
not
expend
your
strength
on
this
party
inquired
wallace
turning
to
montgomery
certainly
not
returned
he
but
i
shall
see
you
amidst
your
noble
friends
at
some
future
period
when
the
peace
your
arms
must
win
is
established
between
the
two
nations
i
shall
then
revisit
scotland
and
openly
declare
my
friendship
for
sir
william
wallace
as
these
are
your
sentiments
replied
wallace
i
shall
hope
that
you
will
unite
your
influence
with
that
of
the
brave
earl
of
gloucester
to
persuade
your
king
to
stop
this
bloodshed
for
it
is
no
vain
boast
to
declare
that
he
may
bury
scotland
beneath
her
slaughtered
sons
but
they
never
will
again
consent
to
acknowledge
any
right
in
an
usurper
sanguinary
have
been
the
instruments
of
my
sovereign
rule
in
scotland
replied
montgomery
but
such
cruelty
is
foreign
to
his
gallant
heart
and
without
offending
that
patriotism
which
would
make
me
revere
its
possessor
were
he
the
lowliest
man
in
your
legions
allow
me
noblest
of
scots
to
plead
one
word
in
vindication
of
him
to
whom
my
allegiance
is
pledged
had
he
come
hither
conducted
by
war
alone
what
would
edward
have
been
worse
than
any
other
conqueror
but
on
the
reverse
was
not
his
right
to
the
supremacy
of
scotland
acknowledged
by
the
princes
who
contended
for
the
crown
and
besides
did
not
all
the
great
lords
swear
fealty
to
england
on
the
day
he
nominated
their
king
had
you
not
been
under
these
impressions
brave
montgomery
i
believe
i
never
should
have
seen
you
in
arms
against
scotland
but
i
will
remove
them
by
a
simple
answer
all
the
princes
whom
you
speak
of
excepting
bruce
of
annandale
did
assent
to
the
newly
offered
claim
of
edward
on
scotland
but
who
amongst
them
had
any
probable
chance
for
the
throne
but
bruce
or
baliol
such
ready
acquiescence
was
meant
to
create
them
one
bruce
conscious
of
his
inherent
rights
rejected
the
iniquitous
demand
of
edward
baliol
accorded
with
it
and
was
made
king
all
our
chiefs
who
were
base
enough
to
worship
the
rising
sun
and
i
may
say
condemn
the
god
of
truth
swore
to
the
falsehood
others
remained
gloomily
silent
and
the
bravest
of
them
retired
to
the
highlands
where
they
dwell
amongst
their
mountains
till
the
cries
of
scotland
called
them
again
to
fight
her
battles
thus
did
edward
establish
himself
as
the
liege
lord
of
this
kingdom
and
whether
the
oppresion
which
followed
were
his
or
his
immediate
acts
it
matters
not
for
he
made
them
his
own
by
his
when
remonstrances
were
sent
to
london
he
neither
punished
nor
reprimanded
the
delinquents
but
marched
an
armed
force
into
our
country
to
compel
us
to
be
trampled
on
it
was
not
an
alexander
nor
a
charlemagne
coming
in
his
strength
to
subdue
ancient
enemies
or
to
aggrandize
his
name
by
vanquishing
nations
far
remote
with
whom
he
could
have
no
affinity
terrible
as
such
ambition
was
it
is
innocence
to
what
edward
has
done
he
came
in
the
first
instance
to
scotland
as
a
friend
the
nation
committed
its
dearest
interests
to
his
virtue
they
put
their
hands
into
his
and
he
bound
them
in
shackles
was
this
honor
was
this
the
right
of
conquest
the
cheek
of
alexander
would
have
blushed
deep
as
his
tyrian
robe
and
the
face
of
charlemagne
turned
pale
as
the
lilies
at
the
bare
suspicion
of
being
capable
of
such
a
deed
no
lord
montgomery
it
is
not
our
conqueror
we
are
opposing
it
is
a
traitor
who
under
the
mask
of
friendship
has
attempted
to
usurp
our
rights
destroy
our
liberties
and
make
a
desert
of
our
once
happy
country
this
is
the
true
statement
of
the
case
and
though
i
wish
not
to
make
a
subject
outrage
his
sovereign
yet
truth
demands
of
you
to
say
to
edward
that
to
withdraw
his
pretensions
from
this
exhausted
country
is
the
restitution
we
may
justly
claim
is
all
that
we
wish
let
him
leave
us
in
peace
and
we
shall
no
longer
make
war
upon
him
but
if
he
persist
which
the
ambassadors
from
the
prince
of
wales
announce
even
as
samson
drew
the
temple
upon
himself
to
destroy
his
enemies
scotland
will
discharge
itself
upon
the
valleys
of
england
and
there
compel
them
to
share
the
fate
in
which
we
may
be
doomed
to
perish
i
will
think
of
this
discourse
returned
montgomery
when
i
am
far
distant
and
rely
on
it
noble
wallace
that
i
will
assert
the
privilege
of
my
birth
and
counsel
my
king
as
becomes
an
honest
man
highly
would
he
estimate
such
counsel
cried
wallace
had
he
virtue
to
feel
that
he
who
will
be
just
to
his
sovereign
enemies
must
be
of
an
honor
that
will
bind
him
with
double
fidelity
to
his
king
such
proof
give
your
sovereign
and
if
he
have
one
spark
of
that
greatness
of
mind
which
you
say
he
possesses
though
he
may
not
adopt
your
advice
he
must
respect
the
adviser
as
wallace
pressed
the
hand
of
his
new
friend
to
leave
him
to
repose
a
messenger
entered
from
lord
mar
to
request
the
regent
presence
in
his
closet
he
found
him
with
lord
de
warenne
the
latter
presented
him
with
another
dispatch
from
the
prince
of
wales
it
was
to
say
that
news
had
reached
him
of
wallace
design
to
attack
the
castles
garrisoned
by
england
on
the
eastern
coast
should
this
information
prove
true
he
the
prince
declared
that
as
a
punishment
for
such
increasing
audacity
he
would
put
lord
douglas
into
closer
confinement
and
while
the
southron
fleets
would
inevitably
baffle
attempts
the
moment
the
exchange
of
prisoners
was
completed
on
the
borders
an
army
from
england
should
enter
scotland
and
ravage
it
with
fire
and
sword
when
wallace
had
heard
this
dispatch
he
smile
and
said
the
deed
is
done
my
lord
de
warenne
both
the
castles
and
the
fleets
are
taken
and
what
punishment
must
we
now
expect
from
this
terrible
threatener
little
from
him
or
his
headlong
counselors
replied
de
warenne
but
thomas
earl
of
lancaster
the
king
nephew
is
come
from
abroad
with
a
numerous
army
he
is
to
conduct
the
scottish
prisoners
to
the
borders
and
then
to
fall
upon
scotland
with
all
his
strength
unless
you
previously
surrender
not
only
berwick
but
stirling
and
the
whole
of
the
district
between
the
forth
and
the
tweed
into
his
hands
my
lord
de
warenne
replied
wallace
you
can
expect
but
one
return
to
these
absurd
demands
i
shall
accompany
you
myself
to
the
scottish
borders
and
there
made
my
reply
de
warenne
who
did
indeed
look
for
this
answer
replied
i
anticipated
that
such
would
be
your
determination
and
i
have
to
regret
that
the
wild
counsels
which
surround
my
prince
precipitate
him
into
conduct
which
must
draw
much
blood
on
both
sides
before
his
royal
father
presence
can
regain
what
he
has
lost
ah
my
lord
replied
wallace
is
it
to
be
nothing
but
war
have
you
now
a
stronghold
of
any
force
in
all
the
highlands
is
not
the
greater
part
of
the
lowlands
free
and
before
this
day
month
not
a
rood
of
land
in
scotland
is
likely
to
hold
a
southron
soldier
we
conquer
but
it
is
for
our
own
why
then
this
unreceding
determination
to
invade
us
not
a
blade
of
grass
would
i
disturb
on
the
other
side
of
the
cheviot
if
we
might
have
peace
let
edward
yield
to
that
and
though
he
has
pierced
us
with
many
wounds
we
will
yet
forgive
him
de
warenne
shook
his
head
i
know
my
king
too
well
to
expect
pacific
measures
he
may
die
with
the
sword
in
his
hand
but
he
will
never
grant
an
hour
repose
to
this
country
till
it
submits
to
his
scepter
then
replied
wallace
the
sword
must
be
the
portion
of
him
and
his
ruthless
tyrant
if
the
blood
of
abel
called
for
vengeance
on
his
murderer
what
must
be
the
vials
of
wrath
which
are
reserved
for
thee
a
flush
overspread
the
face
of
de
warenne
at
this
apostrophe
and
forcing
a
smile
the
strict
notion
of
right
said
he
is
very
well
in
declamation
but
how
would
it
crop
the
wings
of
conquerors
and
shorten
the
warrior
arm
did
they
measure
by
this
rule
how
would
it
indeed
replied
wallace
and
that
they
should
is
most
devoutly
to
be
wished
all
warfare
that
is
not
defensive
is
criminal
and
he
who
draws
his
sword
to
oppress
or
merely
to
aggrandize
is
a
murderer
and
a
robber
this
is
the
plain
truth
lord
de
warenne
i
have
never
considered
it
in
that
light
returned
the
earl
nor
shall
i
turn
philosopher
now
i
revere
your
principle
sir
william
wallace
but
it
is
too
sublime
to
be
mine
nay
nor
would
it
be
politic
for
one
who
holds
his
possessions
in
england
by
the
right
of
conquest
to
question
the
virtue
of
the
deed
by
the
sword
my
ancestors
gained
their
estates
and
with
the
sword
i
have
no
objection
to
extend
my
territories
wallace
now
saw
that
de
warenne
though
a
man
of
honor
was
not
one
of
virtue
though
his
amiable
nature
made
him
gracious
in
the
midst
of
hostility
and
his
good
dispositions
would
not
allow
him
to
act
disgracefull
in
any
concern
yet
duty
to
god
seemed
a
poet
flight
to
him
educated
in
the
forms
of
religion
without
knowing
its
spirit
he
despised
them
and
believing
the
deity
too
wise
to
be
affected
by
mere
virtuous
shows
of
any
kind
his
ignorance
of
the
sublime
benevolence
which
disdains
not
to
provide
food
even
for
the
sparrow
ere
it
falls
made
him
think
the
creator
of
all
too
great
to
care
about
the
actions
of
men
hence
being
without
the
true
principles
of
as
virtue
was
nonsense
to
earl
de
warenne
wallace
did
not
answer
his
remark
and
the
conference
soon
closed
chapter
xlii
chapel
in
snawdoun
though
burning
with
stifled
passions
earl
de
valence
accepted
the
invitation
of
lady
mar
he
hoped
to
see
helen
to
gain
her
ear
for
a
few
minutes
and
above
all
to
find
some
opportunity
during
the
entertainment
of
taking
his
meditated
revenge
on
wallace
the
dagger
seemed
the
surest
way
for
could
he
render
the
blow
effectual
he
should
not
only
destroy
the
rival
of
his
wishes
but
by
ridding
his
monarch
of
a
powerful
foe
deserve
every
honor
at
the
royal
hands
love
and
ambition
again
swelled
his
breast
and
with
recovered
spirits
and
a
glow
on
his
countenance
which
reawakened
hope
had
planted
there
he
accompanied
de
warenne
to
the
palace
the
hall
for
the
feast
was
arrayed
with
feudal
grandeur
the
seats
at
the
table
spread
for
the
knights
of
both
countries
were
covered
with
stuffs
while
the
emblazoned
banners
and
other
armorial
trophies
of
the
nobles
being
hung
aloft
according
to
the
degree
of
the
owner
each
knight
saw
his
precedence
and
where
to
take
his
place
the
most
costly
means
with
the
royally
attired
peacock

up
in

and
gold
dishes
and
wine
of
the
rarest
quality
sparkled
on
the
board
during
the
repast
two
choice
minstrels
were
seated
in
the
gallery
above
to
sing
the
friendship
of
king
alfred
of
england
with
gregory
the
great
of
caledonia
the
squires
and
other
military
attendants
of
the
nobles
present
were
placed
at
tables
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
and
served
with
courteous
hospitality
resentful
alike
at
his
captivity
and
thwarted
passion
de
valence
had
hitherto
refused
to
show
himself
beyond
the
ramparts
of
the
citadel
he
was
therefore
surprised
on
entering
the
hall
of
snawdoun
with
de
warenne
to
see
such
regal
pomp
and
at
the
command
of
the
woman
who
had
so
lately
been
his
prisoner
at
dumbarton
and
whom
because
she
resembled
an
english
lady
who
had
rejected
him
he
had
treated
with
the
most
rigorous
contempt
forgetting
these
indignities
in
the
pride
of
displaying
her
present
consequence
lady
mar
came
forward
to
receive
her
illustrious
guests
her
dress
corresponded
with
the
magnificence
of
the
banquet
a
robe
of
cloth
of
baudkins
enriched
while
it
displayed
the
beauties
of
her
person
her
wimple
blazed
with
jewels
and
a
superb
carkanet
emitted
its
various
rays
from
her
bosom
of
baudkins
was
one
of
the
richest
stuffs
worn
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
said
to
have
been
composed
of
silk
interwoven
with
gold
the
carkanet
was
a
large
broad
necklace
of
precious
stones
of
all
colors
set
in
various
shapes
and
fastened
by
gold
links
into
each
other
de
warenne
followed
her
with
his
eyes
as
she
moved
from
him
with
an
unconscious
sigh
he
whispered
to
de
valence
what
a
land
is
this
where
all
the
women
are
fair
and
the
men
all
brave
i
wish
that
it
and
all
its
men
and
women
were
in
perdition
returned
de
valence
in
a
fierce
tone
lady
ruthven
entering
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
neighboring
chieftains
checked
the
further
expression
of
his
wrath
and
his
eyes
sought
amongst
them
but
in
vain
for
helen
the
chieftains
of
the
scottish
army
with
the
lords
buchan
and
march
were
assembled
around
the
countess
at
the
moment
a
shout
from
the
populace
without
announced
the
arrival
of
the
regent
his
noble
figure
was
now
disencumbered
of
armor
and
with
no
more
sumptuous
garb
than
the
simple
plaid
of
his
country
he
appeared
effulgent
in
manly
beauty
and
the
glory
of
his
recent
deeds
de
valence
frowned
heavily
as
he
looked
on
him
and
thanked
his
fortunate
stars
that
helen
was
absent
from
sharing
the
admiration
which
seemed
to
animate
every
breast
the
eyes
of
lady
mar
at
once
told
the
impassioned
de
valence
too
well
read
in
the
like
expressions
what
were
her
sentiments
toward
the
young
regent
and
the
blushes
and
eager
civilities
of
the
ladies
around
displayed
how
much
they
were
struck
with
the
now
fully
discerned
and
unequaled
graces
of
his
person
lady
mar
forgot
all
in
him
and
indeed
so
much
did
he
seem
the
idol
of
every
heart
that
from
the
two
venerable
lords
of
and
bothwell
to
the
youngest
man
in
company
all
ears
hung
on
his
words
all
eyes
upon
his
countenance
the
entertainment
was
conducted
with
every
regard
to
that
chivalric
courtesy
which
a
noble
conqueror
always
pays
to
the
vanquished
indeed
from
the
wit
and
pleasantry
which
passed
from
the
opposite
sides
of
the
tables
and
in
which
the
murray
was
the
leader
it
rather
appeared
a
convivial
meeting
of
friends
than
an
assemblage
of
mortal
foes
during
the
banquet
the
bards
sung
legends
of
the
scottish
worthies
who
had
brought
honor
to
their
nation
in
days
of
old
and
as
the
board
was
cleared
they
struck
at
once
into
a
full
chorus
wallace
caught
the
sound
of
his
own
name
accompanied
with
epithets
of
extravagant
praise
he
rose
hastily
from
his
chair
and
with
his
hand
motioned
them
to
cease
they
obeyed
but
lady
mar
remonstrating
with
him
he
smilingly
said
it
was
an
ill
omen
to
sing
a
warrior
actions
till
he
were
incapable
of
performing
more
and
therefore
he
begged
she
would
excuse
him
from
hearkening
to
his
then
let
us
change
their
strains
to
a
dance
replied
the
countess
a
hall
a
hall
cried
murray
springing
from
his
seat
delighted
with
the
proposal
i
have
no
objection
answered
wallace
and
putting
the
hand
she
presented
to
him
into
that
of
lord
de
warenne
he
added
i
am
not
of
a
sufficiently
gay
temperament
to
grace
the
change
but
this
earl
may
not
have
the
same
reason
for
declining
so
fair
a
challenge
lady
mar
colored
with
mortification
for
she
had
thought
that
wallace
would
not
venture
to
refuse
before
so
many
but
following
the
impulse
of
de
warenne
arm
she
proceeded
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
where
by
murray
quick
arrangement
the
younger
lords
of
both
countries
had
already
singled
out
ladies
and
were
marshaled
for
the
dance
as
the
hours
moved
on
the
spirits
of
wallace
subsided
from
their
usual
cheering
tone
into
a
sadness
which
he
thought
might
be
noticed
and
wishing
to
escape
observation
for
he
could
not
explain
to
those
gay
ones
why
scenes
like
these
ever
made
him
sorrowful
and
whispering
to
mar
that
he
would
go
for
an
hour
to
visit
montgomery
he
withdrew
unnoticed
by
all
but
his
watchful
enemy
de
valence
who
hovered
about
his
steps
had
heard
him
inquire
of
lady
ruthven
why
helen
was
not
present
he
was
within
hearing
of
this
whisper
also
and
with
a
satanic
joy
the
dagger
shook
in
his
hand
he
knew
that
wallace
had
many
a
solitary
place
to
pass
between
snawdoun
and
the
citadel
and
the
company
being
too
pleasantly
absorbed
to
mark
who
entered
or
disappeared
he
took
an
opportunity
and
stole
out
after
him
but
for
once
the
impetuous
fury
of
hatred
met
a
temporary
disappointment
while
de
valence
was
cowering
like
a
thief
under
the
eaves
of
the
houses
and
prowling
along
the
lonely
paths
to
the
citadel
while
he
started
at
every
noise
as
if
it
came
to
apprehend
him
for
his
meditated
deed
or
rushed
forward
at
the
sight
of
any
solitary
passenger
whom
his
eager
vengeance
almost
mistook
for
wallace
wallace
himself
had
taken
a
different
track
as
he
walked
through
the
illuminated
archways
which
led
from
the
hall
he
perceived
a
darkened
passage
hoping
by
that
avenue
to
quit
the
palace
unobserved
he
immediately
struck
into
it
for
he
was
aware
that
should
he
go
the
usual
way
the
crowd
at
the
gate
would
recognize
him
and
he
could
not
escape
their
acclamations
he
followed
the
passage
for
a
considerable
time
and
at
last
was
stopped
by
a
door
it
yielded
to
his
hand
and
he
found
himself
at
the
entrance
of
a
large
building
he
advanced
and
passing
a
high
screen
of
carved
oak
by
a
dim
light
which
gleamed
from
waxen
tapers
on
the
altar
he
perceived
it
to
be
the
chapel
a
happy
transition
said
he
to
himself
from
the
jubilant
scene
i
have
now
left
from
the
grievous
scenes
i
have
lately
shared
here
gracious
god
thought
he
may
i
unseen
by
any
other
eye
pour
out
my
heart
to
thee
and
here
before
thy
footstool
will
i
declare
thanksgiving
for
thy
mercies
and
with
my
tears
wash
from
my
soul
the
blood
i
have
been
compelled
to
shed
while
advancing
toward
the
altar
he
was
startled
by
a
voice
proceeding
from
the
quarter
whither
he
was
going
and
with
low
and
fervor
uttering
these
words
defend
him
heavenly
father
defend
him
day
and
night
from
the
devices
of
this
wicked
man
and
above
all
during
these
hours
of
revelry
and
confidence
guard
his
unshielded
breast
from
treachery
and
death
the
voice
faltered
and
added
with
greater
agitation
ah
unhappy
me
that
i
should
pluck
peril
on
the
head
of
william
wallace
a
figure
which
had
been
hidden
by
the
rails
of
the
altar
with
these
words
rose
and
stretching
forth
her
clasped
hands
exclaimed
but
thou
who
knowest
i
had
no
blame
in
this
wilt
not
afflict
me
by
his
danger
thou
wilt
deliver
him
o
god
out
of
the
hand
of
this
cruel
foe
wallace
was
not
more
astonished
at
hearing
that
some
one
in
whom
he
trusted
was
his
secret
enemy
than
at
seeing
lady
helen
in
that
place
at
that
hour
and
addressing
heaven
for
him
there
was
something
so
celestial
in
the
maid
as
she
stood
in
her
white
robes
true
emblems
of
her
own
innocence
before
the
divine
footstool
that
although
her
prayers
were
delivered
with
a
pathos
which
told
they
sprung
from
a
heart
more
than
commonly
interested
in
their
object
yet
every
word
and
look
breathed
so
eloquently
the
virgin
purity
of
her
soul
the
hallowed
purpose
of
her
petitions
that
wallace
drawn
by
the
sympathy
with
which
kindred
virtues
ever
attract
spirit
to
spirit
did
not
hesitate
to
discover
himself
he
stepped
from
the
shadow
which
involved
him
the
pale
light
of
the
tapers
shone
upon
his
advancing
figure
eyes
fell
upon
him
as
she
turned
round
she
was
transfixed
and
silent
he
moved
forward
lady
helen
said
he
in
a
respectful
and
even
tender
voice
at
the
sound
a
fearful
rushing
of
shame
seemed
to
overwhelm
her
faculties
for
she
knew
not
how
long
he
might
have
been
in
the
church
and
that
he
had
not
heard
her
beseech
heaven
to
make
him
less
the
object
of
her
thoughts
she
sunk
on
her
knees
beside
the
altar
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
the
action
the
confusion
might
have
betrayed
her
secret
to
wallace
but
he
only
thought
of
her
pious
invocations
for
his
safety
he
only
remembered
that
it
was
she
who
had
given
a
holy
grave
to
the
only
woman
he
could
ever
love
and
full
of
gratitude
as
a
pilgrim
would
approach
a
saint
he
drew
near
to
her
holiest
of
earthly
maids
said
he
kneeling
down
beside
her
in
this
lonely
hour
in
the
sacred
presence
of
almighty
purity
receive
my
soul
thanks
for
the
prayers
i
have
this
moment
heard
you
breathe
for
me
they
are
more
precious
to
me
lady
helen
than
the
generous
plaudits
of
my
country
they
are
a
greater
reward
to
me
than
would
have
been
the
crown
with
which
scotland
sought
to
endow
me
for
do
they
not
give
me
what
all
the
world
can
not
the
protection
of
heaven
i
would
pray
for
it
softly
answered
helen
but
not
venturing
to
look
up
the
prayer
of
meek
goodness
we
know
much
continue
then
to
offer
up
that
incense
for
me
added
he
and
i
shall
march
forth
with
redoubled
strength
for
i
shall
think
holy
maid
that
i
have
yet
a
marion
to
pray
for
me
on
earth
as
well
as
one
in
heaven
lady
helen
heart
beat
at
these
words
but
it
was
with
no
unhallowed
emotion
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
her
face
and
clasping
them
looked
up
marion
will
indeed
echo
all
my
prayers
and
he
who
reads
my
heart
will
i
trust
grant
them
they
are
for
your
life
sir
william
wallace
added
she
turning
to
him
with
agitation
for
it
is
menaced
i
will
inquire
by
whom
answered
he
when
i
have
first
paid
my
duty
at
this
altar
for
guarding
it
so
long
and
dare
i
daughter
of
goodness
to
ask
you
to
unite
the
voice
of
your
daughter
of
goodness
to
ask
you
to
unite
the
voice
of
your
gentle
spirit
with
the
secret
one
of
mine
i
would
beseech
heaven
for
pardon
on
my
own
transgressions
i
would
ask
of
its
mercy
to
establish
the
liberty
of
scotland
pray
with
me
lady
helen
and
the
invocations
our
souls
utter
will
meet
the
promise
of
him
who
said
two
or
three
are
joined
together
in
prayer
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
them
helen
looked
on
him
with
a
holy
smile
and
pressing
the
crucifix
which
she
held
to
her
lips
bowed
her
head
on
it
in
mute
assent
wallace
threw
himself
prostrate
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
and
the
fervor
of
his
sighs
alone
breathed
to
his
companion
the
deep
devotion
of
his
soul
how
the
time
passed
he
knew
not
so
was
he
absorbed
in
the
communion
which
his
spirit
held
in
heaven
with
the
most
gracious
of
beings
but
the
bell
of
the
palace
striking
the
matin
hour
reminded
him
he
was
yet
on
earth
and
looking
up
his
eyes
met
those
of
helen
his
devotional
rosary
hung
on
his
arm
he
kissed
it
wear
this
holy
maid
said
he
in
remembrance
of
this
hour
she
bowed
her
fair
neck
and
he
put
the
consecrated
chain
over
it
let
it
bear
witness
to
a
friendship
added
he
clasping
her
hands
in
his
which
will
be
cemented
by
eternal
ties
in
heaven
helen
bent
her
face
upon
his
hands
he
felt
the
sacred
tears
of
so
pure
a
compact
upon
them
and
while
he
looked
up
as
if
he
thought
the
spirit
of
his
marion
hovered
near
to
bless
a
communion
so
remote
from
all
infringement
of
the
sentiment
he
had
dedicated
forever
to
her
helen
raised
her
head
and
with
a
terrible
shriek
throwing
her
arms
around
the
body
of
wallace
he
that
moment
felt
an
assassin
steel
in
his
back
and
she
fell
senseless
on
his
breast
he
started
on
his
feet
a
dagger
fell
from
his
wound
to
the
ground
but
the
hand
which
had
struck
the
blow
he
could
nowhere
see
to
search
further
was
then
impossible
for
helen
lay
on
his
bosom
like
dead
not
doubting
that
she
had
seen
his
assailant
and
fainted
from
alarm
he
was
laying
her
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
that
he
might
bring
some
water
from
the
basin
of
the
chapel
to
recover
her
when
he
saw
that
her
arm
was
not
only
stained
with
his
blood
but
streaming
with
her
own
the
dagger
had
gashed
it
in
reaching
him
execrable
villain
cried
he
turning
cold
at
the
sight
and
instantly
comprehending
that
it
was
to
defend
him
she
had
thrown
her
arms
around
him
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
agony
are
two
of
the
most
matchless
women
the
earth
ever
saw
to
die
for
me
trembling
with
alarm
and
with
renewed
grief
for
the
terrible
scene
of
ellerslie
was
now
brought
in
all
its
horrors
before
him
he
tore
off
her
veil
to
staunch
the
blood
but
the
cut
was
too
wide
for
his
surgery
and
losing
every
other
consideration
in
fears
for
her
life
he
again
took
her
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
out
of
the
chapel
he
hastened
through
the
dark
passage
and
almost
flying
along
the
lighted
galleries
entered
the
hall
the
noisy
fright
of
the
servants
as
he
broke
through
their
ranks
at
the
door
alarmed
the
revelers
and
turning
round
what
was
their
astonishment
to
behold
the
regent
pale
and
streaming
with
blood
bearing
in
his
arms
a
lady
apparently
lifeless
and
covered
with
the
same
dreadful
hue
mar
instantly
recognized
his
daughter
and
rushed
toward
her
with
a
cry
of
horror
wallace
sunk
with
his
breathless
load
upon
the
nearest
bench
and
while
her
head
rested
on
his
bosom
ordered
surgery
to
be
brought
lady
mar
gazed
on
the
spectacle
with
a
benumbed
dismay
none
present
durst
ask
a
question
till
a
priest
drawing
near
unwrapped
the
arm
of
helen
and
discovered
its
deep
wound
who
has
done
this
cried
her
father
to
wallace
with
all
the
anguish
of
a
parent
in
his
countenance
i
know
not
replied
he
but
i
believe
some
villain
who
aimed
at
my
life
where
is
lord
de
valence
exclaimed
mar
suddenly
recollecting
his
menaces
against
wallace
i
am
here
replied
he
in
a
composed
voice
would
you
have
me
seek
the
assassin
no
no
cried
the
earl
ashamed
of
his
suspicion
but
here
has
been
some
foul
work
and
my
daughter
is
slain
oh
not
so
cried
murray
who
had
hurried
toward
the
dreadful
group
and
knelt
at
her
side
she
will
not
die
so
much
excellence
can
not
die
a
stifled
groan
from
wallace
accompanied
by
a
look
told
murray
that
he
had
known
the
death
of
similar
excellence
with
this
unanswerable
appeal
the
young
chieftain
dropped
his
head
on
the
other
hand
of
helen
and
could
any
one
have
seen
his
face
buried
as
it
was
in
her
robes
they
would
have
beheld
tears
of
agony
drawn
from
that
heart
the
wound
was
closed
by
the
aid
of
another
surgical
priest
who
had
followed
the
former
into
the
hall
and
helen
sighed
convulsively
at
this
intimation
of
recovery
the
priest
made
all
excepting
those
who
supported
her
stand
back
but
as
lady
mar
lingered
near
wallace
she
saw
the
paleness
of
his
countenance
turn
to
a
deadly
hue
and
his
eyes
closing
he
sunk
back
on
the
bench
her
shrieks
now
resounded
through
the
hall
and
falling
into
hysterics
she
was
taken
into
the
gallery
while
the
more
collected
lady
ruthven
remained
to
attend
the
victims
before
her
at
the
instant
wallace
fell
de
valence
losing
all
caught
hold
of
de
warenne
arm
and
whispering
i
thought
it
was
sure
long
live
king
edward
rushed
out
of
the
hall
these
words
revealed
to
de
warenne
who
was
the
assassin
and
though
struck
to
the
soul
with
the
turpitude
of
the
deed
he
thought
the
honor
of
england
would
not
allow
him
to
accuse
the
perpetrator
and
he
remained
silent
the
inanimate
form
of
wallace
was
now
drawn
from
under
that
of
helen
and
in
the
act
discovered
the
clotted
with
blood
and
the
regent
back
bathed
in
the
same
vital
stream
having
found
his
wound
the
priests
laid
him
on
the
ground
and
were
administering
their
balsams
when
helen
opened
her
eyes
her
mind
was
too
strongly
possessed
with
the
horror
which
had
entered
it
before
she
became
insensible
to
lose
the
consciousness
of
her
fears
and
immediately
looking
around
with
an
aghast
countenance
her
sight
met
the
outstretched
body
of
wallace
oh
is
it
so
cried
she
throwing
herself
into
the
bosom
of
her
father
he
understood
what
she
meant
he
lives
my
child
but
he
is
wounded
like
yourself
have
courage
revive
for
his
sake
and
for
mine
helen
helen
dear
helen
cried
murray
clinging
to
her
hand
while
you
live
what
that
loves
you
can
die
while
these
acclamations
surrounded
her
couch
edwin
in
speechless
apprehension
supported
the
insensible
head
of
wallace
and
de
warenne
inwardly
execrating
the
perfidy
of
de
valence
knelt
down
to
assist
the
good
friars
in
their
office
a
few
minutes
longer
and
the
staunched
blood
refluxing
to
the
chieftain
heart
he
too
opened
his
eyes
and
instantly
turning
on
his
what
has
happened
to
me
where
is
lady
helen
demanded
he
at
his
voice
which
aroused
helen
who
believing
that
he
was
indeed
dead
was
relapsing
into
her
former
state
she
could
only
press
her
father
hand
to
her
lips
as
if
he
had
given
the
life
she
so
valued
and
bursting
into
a
shower
of
relieving
tears
breathed
out
her
rapturous
thanks
to
god
her
low
murmurs
reached
the
ears
of
wallace
the
dimness
having
left
his
eyes
and
the
blood
the
extreme
loss
of
which
from
his
great
agitation
had
alone
caused
him
to
swoon
being
stopped
by
an
embalmed
bandage
he
seemed
to
feel
no
impediment
from
his
wound
and
rising
hastened
to
the
side
of
helen
lord
mar
softly
whispered
his
sir
william
wallace
is
at
your
feet
my
dearest
child
look
on
him
and
tell
him
that
you
live
i
am
well
my
father
returned
she
in
a
faltering
voice
and
may
it
indeed
please
the
almighty
to
preserve
him
i
too
am
alive
and
well
answered
wallace
but
thanks
to
god
and
to
you
blessed
lady
that
i
am
so
had
not
that
lovely
arm
received
the
greater
part
of
the
dagger
it
must
have
reached
my
heart
an
exclamation
of
horror
at
what
might
have
been
burst
from
the
lips
of
edwin
helen
could
have
it
but
she
now
held
her
feelings
under
too
severe
a
rein
to
allow
them
so
to
speak
thanks
to
the
protector
of
the
just
cried
she
for
your
preservation
who
raised
my
eyes
to
see
the
assassin
his
cloak
was
held
before
his
face
and
i
could
not
discern
it
but
i
saw
a
dagger
aimed
at
the
bank
of
sir
william
wallace
how
i
caught
it
i
can
not
tell
for
i
seemed
to
die
on
the
instant
lady
mar
having
recovered
the
hall
just
as
wallace
had
knelt
down
beside
helen
maddened
with
the
sight
of
the
man
on
whom
her
soul
doted
in
such
a
position
before
her
rival
she
advanced
hastily
and
in
a
voice
which
she
vainly
attempted
to
render
composed
and
gentle
sternly
addressed
her
alarmed
as
i
have
been
by
your
apparent
danger
i
can
not
but
be
uneasy
at
the
attendant
circumstances
tell
me
therefore
and
satisfy
this
anxious
company
how
it
happened
that
you
should
be
with
the
regent
when
we
supposed
you
an
invalid
in
your
room
and
were
told
he
was
gone
to
the
citadel
a
crimson
blush
overspread
the
cheeks
of
helen
at
this
question
for
it
was
delivered
in
a
tone
which
insinuated
that
something
more
than
accident
had
occasioned
their
meeting
but
as
innocence
dictated
she
answered
i
was
in
the
chapel
at
prayers
sir
william
wallace
entered
with
the
same
design
and
at
the
moment
he
desired
me
to
mingle
mine
with
his
this
assassin
appeared
and
she
repeated
i
saw
his
dagger
raised
against
our
protector
and
i
saw
no
more
there
was
not
a
heart
present
that
did
not
give
credence
to
this
account
but
the
polluted
one
of
lady
mar
jealousy
almost
laid
it
bare
she
smiled
incredulously
and
turning
to
the
company
our
noble
friends
will
accept
my
apology
if
in
so
delicate
an
investigation
i
should
beg
that
my
family
alone
may
be
present
wallace
perceived
the
tendency
of
her
words
and
not
doubting
the
impression
they
might
make
on
the
minds
of
men
ignorant
of
the
virtues
of
lady
helen
he
instantly
rose
for
once
cried
he
i
must
counteract
a
lady
orders
it
is
my
wish
lords
that
you
will
not
leave
this
place
till
i
explain
how
i
came
to
disturb
the
devotions
of
lady
helen
wearied
with
festivities
in
which
my
alienated
heart
can
so
little
share
i
thought
to
pass
an
hour
with
lord
montgomery
in
the
citadel
and
in
seeking
to
avoid
the
crowded
avenues
of
the
palace
i
entered
the
chapel
to
my
surprise
i
found
lady
helen
there
i
heard
her
pray
for
the
happiness
of
scotland
for
the
safety
of
her
defenders
and
my
mind
being
in
a
frame
to
join
in
such
petitions
i
apologized
for
my
unintentional
intrusion
and
begged
permission
to
mingle
my
devotions
with
hers
nay
impressed
and
privileged
by
the
sacredness
of
the
place
i
presumed
still
further
and
before
the
altar
of
purity
poured
forth
my
gratitude
for
the
duties
she
had
paid
to
the
remains
of
my
murdered
wife
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
assassin
appeared
i
heard
lady
helen
scream
i
felt
her
fall
on
my
breast
and
at
that
instant
the
dagger
entered
my
back
this
is
the
history
of
our
meeting
and
the
assassin
whomsoever
he
may
be
and
how
long
soever
he
was
in
the
church
before
he
sought
to
perpetrate
the
deed
were
he
to
speak
and
capable
of
uttering
truth
could
declare
no
other
but
where
is
he
to
be
found
intemperately
and
suspiciously
demanded
lady
mar
if
his
testimony
be
necessary
to
validate
mine
returned
wallace
with
dignity
i
believe
the
lady
helen
can
point
to
his
name
name
him
helen
name
him
my
dear
cousin
cried
murray
that
i
may
have
some
link
with
thee
o
let
me
avenge
this
deed
tell
me
his
name
and
so
yield
to
me
all
that
thou
canst
now
bestow
on
andrew
murray
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
murray
voice
that
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
helen
i
can
not
name
him
whom
i
suspect
to
any
but
sir
william
wallace
and
i
would
not
do
it
to
him
replied
she
were
it
not
to
warn
him
against
future
danger
i
did
not
see
the
face
therefore
how
dare
i
set
you
to
take
vengeance
on
one
who
perchance
may
be
innocent
i
forgive
him
my
blood
since
heaven
has
spared
to
scotland
its
protector
if
he
be
a
southron
cried
baron
hilton
coming
forward
name
him
gracious
lady
and
i
will
answer
for
it
that
were
he
the
son
of
a
king
he
would
meet
death
from
our
monarch
for
this
unknightly
outrage
i
thank
your
zeal
brave
chief
replied
she
but
i
would
not
abandon
to
certain
death
even
a
wicked
man
may
he
repent
i
will
name
him
to
sir
william
wallace
alone
and
when
he
knows
his
secret
enemy
the
vigilance
of
his
own
honor
i
trust
will
be
his
guard
meanwhile
my
father
i
would
withdraw
then
whispering
to
him
she
was
lifted
in
his
arms
and
murray
and
carried
from
the
hall
as
she
moved
away
her
eyes
met
those
of
wallace
he
arose
but
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
with
an
expression
in
her
countenance
of
an
adieu
so
firm
yet
so
tender
that
feeling
as
if
he
were
parting
from
a
beloved
sister
who
had
just
risked
her
life
for
him
and
whom
he
might
never
see
again
he
uttered
not
a
word
to
any
that
were
present
but
leaning
on
edwin
left
the
hall
by
an
opposite
door
chapter
xliii
the
carse
of
stirling
daybreak
gleamed
over
the
sky
before
the
wondering
spectators
of
the
late
extraordinary
scene
had
dispersed
to
their
quarters
de
warenne
was
so
well
convinced
by
what
had
dropped
from
de
valence
of
his
having
been
the
assassin
that
when
they
met
at
sunrise
to
take
horse
for
the
borders
he
made
him
no
other
salutation
than
an
exclamation
of
surprise
not
to
find
him
under
an
arrest
for
the
last
night
work
the
wily
scot
knew
better
replied
de
valence
than
so
to
expose
the
reputation
of
the
lady
he
knew
that
she
received
the
wound
in
his
arms
and
he
durst
not
seize
me
for
fear
i
should
proclaim
it
he
can
not
fear
that
replied
de
warenne
for
he
has
proclaimed
it
himself
he
has
told
every
particular
of
his
meeting
with
lady
helen
in
the
chapel
even
her
sheltering
him
with
her
arms
so
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
declare
but
your
own
infamy
for
infamous
i
must
call
it
lord
aymer
and
nothing
but
the
respect
i
owe
my
country
prevents
me
pointing
the
eyes
of
the
indignant
scots
to
you
nothing
but
the
stigma
your
exposure
would
bring
upon
the
english
name

at
this
speech
of
de
warenne
why
my
lord
warden
said
he
have
you
been
taking
lessons
of
this
doughty
scot
that
you
talk
thus
it
was
not
with
such
sentiments
you
overthrew
the
princes
of
wales
and
made
the
kings
of
ireland
fly
before
you
you
would
tell
another
story
were
your

and
i
can
tell
you
that
any
vengeance
is
not
satisfied
i
will
yet
see
the
brightness
of
those
eyes
on
which
the
proud
daughter
of
mar
hangs
so
fondly
extinguished
in
death
maid
or

be
torn
from

and
if
i
can
not
make
her
a

she
shall
at

be
mine
as
his
widow
for
i
swear
not
to
be

shame
de
valence
i
should
blush
to
owe
my
courage
to
rivalry
or
my
perseverance
in
the
field
to
a
licentious
passion
you
know
what
you
have
confessed
to
me
were
once
your
designs
on
helen
mar
every
man
according
to
his
nature
returned
de
valence
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
mounted
his
horse
the
cavalcade
of
southrons
now
appeared
they
were
met
on
the
carse
by
the
regent
who
not
regarding
the
smart
of
a
closing
wound
advanced
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
men
to
see
his
prisoners
over
the
borders
by
helen
desire
lord
mar
had
informed
wallace
what
had
been
the
threats
of
de
valence
and
that
she
suspected
him
to
be
the
assassin
but
this
suspicion
was
put
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
evidence
of
the
dagger
which
edwin
had
found
in
the
chapel
its
hilt
was
enameled
with
the
martlets
of
de
valence
at
sight
of
it
a
general
indignation
filled
the
scottish
chiefs
and
assembling
round
their
regent
with
one
breath
they
demanded
that
the
false
earl
should
be
detained
and
punished
as
became
the
honor
of
nations
for
so
execrable
a
breach
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
wallace
replied
that
he
believed
the
attack
to
have
been
instigated
by
a
personal
motive
and
therefore
as
he
was
the
object
not
the
state
of
scotland
he
should
merely
acquaint
the
earl
that
his
villainy
was
known
and
let
the
shame
of
disgrace
be
his
punishment
ah
observed
lord
bothwell
men
who
trample
on
conscience
soon
get
over
shame
true
replied
wallace
but
i
suit
my
actions
to
my
mind
not
to
my
enemy
and
if
he
can
not
feel
dishonor
i
will
not
so
far
disparage
myself
as
to
think
one
so
base
worthy
my
resentment
while
he
was
quieting
the
reawakened
indignation
of
his
nobles
whose
blood
began
to
boil
afresh
at
sight
of
the
assassin
the
southron
lords
conducted
by
lord
mar
approached
when
that
nobleman
drew
near
wallace
first
inquiry
was
for
lady
helen
the
earl
informed
him
he
had
received
intelligence
of
her
having
slept
without
fever
and
that
she
was
not
awake
when
the
messenger
came
off
with
his
good
tidings
that
all
was
likely
to
be
well
with
her
was
comfort
to
wallace
and
with
an
unruffled
brow
riding
up
to
the
squadron
of
southrons
which
was
headed
by
de
warenne
and
de
valence
he
immediately
approached
the
latter
and
drawing
out
the
dagger
held
it
toward
him
the
next
time
sir
earl
said
he
that
you
draw
this
dagger
let
it
be
with
a
more
knightly
aim
than
assassination
de
valence
surprised
took
it
in
confusion
and
without
answer
but
his
countenance
told
the
state
of
his
mind
he
was
humbled
by
the
man
he
hated
and
while
a
sense
of
the
disgrace
he
had
incurred
tore
his
proud
soul
he
had
not
dignity
enough
to
acknowledge
the
generosity
of
his
enemy
in
again
giving
him
a
life
which
his
treachery
had
so
often
forfeited
having
taken
the
dagger
he
wreaked
the
exasperated
vengeance
of
his
malice
upon
the
senseless
steel
and
breaking
it
asunder
threw
the
pieces
into
the
air
while
turning
from
wallace
with
an
affected
disdain
he
exclaimed
to
the
shivered
weapon
you
shall
not
betray
me
again
nor
you
betray
our
honors
lord
de
valence
exclaimed
earl
de
warenne
and
therefore
though
the
nobleness
of
the
william
wallace
leaves
you
at
large
after
this
outrage
on
his
person
we
will
assent
our
innocence
of
connivance
with
the
deed
and
as
lord
warden
of
this
realm
i
order
you
under
arrest
till
we
pass
the
scottish
lines
is
well
cried
hilton
that
such
is
your
determination
my
lord
else
no
honest
man
could
have
continued
in
the
same
company
with
one
who
has
so
tarnished
the
english
name
no
cried
his
brother
baron
venerable
blenkinsopp
reining
up
his
steed
i
would
forfeit
house
and
lands
first
de
valence
with
an
ironical
smile
looked
toward
the
squadron
which
approached
to
obey
de
warenne
and
haughtily
answered
though
it
be
dishonor
to
march
with
me
out
of
scotland
the
proudest
of
you
all
will
deem
it
an
honor
to
be
allowed
to
return
with
me
hither
i
have
an
eye
on
those
who
stand
with
cap
in
hand
to
rebellion
and
for
you
sir
william
wallace
added
he
turning
to
him
who
was
also
curbing
his
impatient
charger
i
hold
no
terms
with
a
rebel
and
deem
all
honor
that
would
rid
my
sovereign
and
the
earth
of
such
arrogance
before
wallace
could
answer
he
saw
de
valence
struck
from
his
horse
by
the
lochaberax
of
edwin
indignant
at
the
insult
offered
to
his
beloved
commander
he
had
suddenly
raised
his
arm
and
aiming
a
blow
with
all
his
strength
the
earl
was
immediately
stunned
and
precipitated
to
the
ground
at
sight
of
the
fall
of
the
southron
chief
the
scottish
troops
aware
of
there
being
some
misunderstanding
between
their
regent
and
the
english
lords
uttered
a
shout
wallace
to
prevent
accidents
sent
instantly
to
the
lines
to
appease
the
tumult
and
throwing
himself
off
his
horse
hastened
to
the
prostrate
earl
a
fearful
pause
reigned
throughout
the
southron
ranks
they
did
not
know
but
that
the
enraged
scots
would
now
fall
on
them
and
in
spite
of
their
regent
exterminate
them
on
the
spot
the
troops
were
running
forward
when
wallace
messengers
arrived
and
checked
them
and
himself
calling
to
edwin
stopped
his
further
chastisement
of
the
recovering
earl
edwin
you
have
done
wrong
cried
he
give
me
that
weapon
which
you
have
sullied
by
raising
it
against
a
prisoner
totally
in
our
power
with
a
vivid
blush
the
noble
boy
resigned
the
weapon
to
his
general
yet
with
an
unappeased
glance
on
the
prostrate
de
valence
he
exclaimed
but
have
you
not
granted
life
twice
to
this
prisoner
and
has
he
not
in
return
raised
his
hand
against
his
life
and
lady
helen
you
pardon
him
again
and
in
the
moment
of
your
clemency
he
insults
the
lord
regent
of
scotland
in
the
face
of
both
nations
i
could
not
hear
this
and
live
without
making
him
feel
that
you
have
those
about
you
who
will
not
forgive
such
crimes
edwin
returned
wallace
had
not
the
lord
regent
power
to
punish
and
if
he
see
right
to
hold
his
hand
those
who
strike
for
him
invade
his
dignity
i
should
be
unworthy
the
honor
of
protecting
a
brave
nation
did
i
stoop
to
tread
on
every
reptile
that
stings
me
in
my
path
leave
lord
de
valence
to
the
sentence
his
commander
has
pronounced
and
as
an
expiation
for
your
having
offended
both
military
and
moral
law
this
day
you
must
remain
at
stirling
till
i
return
into
scotland
de
valence
hardly
awake
from
the
stupor
which
the
blow
of
the
had
occasioned
for
indignation
had
given
to
the
young
warrior
the
strength
of
manhood
was
raised
from
the
ground
and
soon
after
coming
to
himself
and
being
made
sensible
of
what
had
happened
he
was
taken
foaming
with
rage
and
mortification
into
the
center
of
the
southron
lines
alarmed
at
the
confusion
he
saw
at
a
distance
lord
montgomery
ordered
his
litter
round
from
the
rear
to
the
front
and
hearing
all
that
had
passed
joined
with
de
warenne
in
pleading
for
the
abashed
edwin
his
youth
and
zeal
cried
montgomery
are
sufficient
to
excuse
the
intemperance
of
the
deed
no
interrupted
edwin
i
have
offended
and
i
will
explate
only
my
honored
lord
said
he
approaching
wallace
while
he
checked
the
emotion
which
would
have
flowed
from
his
eyes
when
i
am
absent
sometimes
remember
that
it
was
edwin
love
which
hurried
him
to
this
disgrace
my
dear
edwin
returned
wallace
there
are
many
impetuous
spirits
in
scotland
who
need
the
lesson
i
now
enforce
upon
you
and
they
will
be
brought
to
maintain
the
law
of
honor
when
they
see
that
their
regent
spares
not
its
slightest
violation
even
when
committed
by
his
best
beloved
friend
farewell
till
we
meet
again
edwin
kissed
wallace
hand
in
silence
it
was
not
wet
with
his
tears
and
drawing
his
bonnet
hastily
over
his
eyes
he
retired
into
the
rear
of
lord
mar
party
that
nobleman
soon
after
took
leave
of
the
regent
who
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
legions
the
trumpets
blew
the
signal
of
march
edwin
at
the
sound
which
a
few
minutes
before
he
would
have
greeted
with
so
much
joy
felt
his
heart
give
way
he
sobbed
aloud
and
striking
his
heel
on
the
side
of
his
horse
galloped
to
a
distance
to
bide
from
all
eyes
the
violence
of
his
regrets
the
trampling
of
the
departing
troops
rolled
over
the
ground
like
receding
thunder
edwin
at
last
stole
a
look
toward
the
plain
he
beheld
a
vast
cloud
of
dust
but
no
more
the
squadrons
of
his
friend
chapter
xliv
the
cheviots
as
wallace
pursued
his
march
along
the
once
fertile
and
valleys
of
clydesdale
their
present
appearance
affected
him
like
the
sight
of
a
friend
whom
he
had
seen
depart
in
all
the
graces
of
youth
and
prosperity
but
met
again
overcome
with
disease
and
wretchedness
the
pastures
of
carstairs
on
the
east
of
the
river
which
used
at
this
season
to
be
whitened
with
sheep
and
sending
forth
the
lowings
of
abundant
cattle
and
the
vales
which
had
teemed
with
reapers
rejoicing
in
the
harvest
were
now
laid
waste
and
silent
the
plain
presented
one
wide
flat
of
desolation
where
once
was
the
enameled
meadow
a
dreary
swamp
extended
its
vapory
surface
and
the
road
which
a
happy
peasantry
no
longer
trod
lay
choked
up
with
thistles
and
rank
grass
while
birds
and
animals
of
chase
would
spring
from
its
thickets
on
the
lonely
traveler
to
tell
him
by
their
wild
astonishment
that
he
was
distant
from
even
the
haunts
of
men
the
remains
of
villages
were
visible
but
the
blackness
of
ashes
marked
the
walls
of
the
ruined
dwellings
wallace
felt
that
he
was
passing
through
the
country
in
which
his
marion
had
been
rifled
of
her
life
and
as
he
moved
along
nature
all
around
seemed
to
have
partaken
of
her
death
as
he
rode
over
the
moors
which
led
toward
the
district
of
crawford
lammington
those
hills
amidst
which
the
beloved
of
his
soul
first
drew
breath
he
became
totally
silent
time
rolled
back
he
was
no
longer
the
regent
of
scotland
but
the
fond
lover
of
marion
braidfoot
his
heart
beat
as
it
was
wont
to
do
in
turning
his
horse
down
the
defile
which
led
direct
to
lammington
but
the
scene
was
completely
changed
the
groves
in
which
he
had
so
often
wandered
with
her
were
gone
they
had
been
cut
down
for
the
very
purpose
of
destroying
that
place
which
had
once
been
the
abode
of
beauty
and
innocence
and
of
all
the
tender
charities
one
shattered
tower
alone
remained
of
the
house
of
lammington
the
scathing
of
fire
embrowned
its
sides
and
the
uprooted
garden
marked
where
the
ravager
had
been
while
his
army
marched
before
him
along
the
heights
of
crawford
wallace
slowly
moved
forward
musing
on
the
scene
in
turning
the
angle
of
a
shattered
wall
his
horse
started
and
the
next
moment
he
perceived
an
aged
figure
with
a
beard
white
as
snow
and
wrapped
in
a
dark
plaid
emerging
from
the
ground
at
sight
of
the
apparition
murray
who
accompanied
his
friend
and
had
hitherto
kept
silent
suddenly
exclaimed
i
conjure
you
honest
scot
ghost
or
man
give
us
a
subject
for
conversation
and
as
a
beginning
pray
tell
me
to
whom
this
ruined
tower
belonged
the
sight
of
two
warriors
in
the
scottish
garb
encouraged
the
old
man
and
stepping
out
on
the
ground
he
drew
near
to
murray
ruined
indeed
sir
replied
he
and
its
story
is
very
sad
when
the
southrons
who
hold
annandale
heard
of
the
brave
acts
of
sir
william
wallace
they
sent
an
army
to
destroy
this
castle
and
domains
which
are
his
in
right
of
the
lady
marion
of
lammington
sweet
creature
i
hear
they
foully
murdered
her
in
lanark
murray
was
smitten
speechless
at
this
information
for
had
he
suspected
there
was
any
private
reason
with
wallace
for
his
silent
lingering
about
this
desolate
spot
he
would
rather
have
drawn
him
away
than
have
stopped
to
ask
questions
and
did
you
know
lady
marion
venerable
old
man
inquired
wallace
in
a
voice
so
descriptive
of
what
was
passing
in
his
heart
that
the
old
man
turned
toward
him
and
struck
with
his
noble
mien
he
pulled
off
his
bonnet
and
bowing
answered
did
i
know
her
she
was
nursed
on
these
knees
and
my
wife
who
cherished
her
sweet
infancy
is
now
within
yon
brae
it
is
our
only
home
for
the
southrons
burnt
us
out
of
the
castle
where
our
young
lady
left
us
when
she
went
to
be
married
to
the
brave
young
wallace
he
was
as
handsome
a
youth
as
ever
the
sun
shone
upon
and
he
loved
my
lady
from
a
boy
i
never
shall
forget
the
day
when
she
stood
on
the
top
of
that
rock
and
let
a
garland
he
had
made
for
her
fall
into
the
clyde
without
more
ado
never
caring
because
it
is
the
deepest
here
of
any
part
of
the
river
he
jumps
in
after
it
and
i
after
him
and
well
i
did
for
when
i
caught
him
by
his
bonny
golden
locks
he
was
insensible
his
head
had
struck
against
a
stone
in
the
plunge
and
a
great
cut
was
over
his
forehead
god
bless
him
a
sorry
scar
it
left
but
many
i
warrant
have
the
southrons
now
made
on
his
comely
countenance
i
have
never
seen
him
since
he
grew
a
man
gregory
the
honest
steward
of
lammington
was
now
recognized
in
this
old
man
narration
but
time
and
hardship
had
so
altered
his
appearance
that
wallace
could
not
have
otherwise
recollected
the
ruddy
face
and
active
figure
of
his
companion
in
the
shaking
limbs
and
pallid
visage
of
the
hoary
speaker
when
he
ended
the
chief
threw
himself
from
his
horse
he
approached
the
old
man
with
one
hand
he
took
off
his
helmet
and
with
the
other
putting
back
the
same
golden
locks
he
said
was
the
scar
you
speak
of
anything
like
this
his
face
was
now
close
to
the
eye
of
gregory
who
in
the
action
the
words
and
the
mark
immediately
recognizing
the
young
playmate
of
his
happiest
days
with
an
almost
shriek
of
joy
threw
himself
on
his
neck
and
wept
then
looking
up
with
tears
rolling
over
his
cheeks
he
exclaimed
o
power
of
mercy
take
me
to
thyself
since
my
eyes
have
seen
the
deliverer
of
scotland
not
so
my
venerable
friend
returned
wallace
you
must
make
these
desolated
regions
bloom
anew
decorate
them
gregory
as
you
would
do
the
tomb
of
your
mistress
i
give
them
to
you
and
yours
marion
and
i
have
no
posterity
let
her
if
he
still
live
let
him
be
now
the
laird
of
lammington
he
does
live
replied
the
old
man
but
the
shadow
of
what
he
was
in
attempting
with
a
few
resolute
lads
to
defend
these
domains
he
was
severely
wounded
his
companions
were
slain
and
i
found
him
on
the
other
side
of
my
lady
garden
left
for
dead
we
fled
with
him
to
the
woods
and
there
remained
till
all
about
here
was
laid
in
ashes
finding
the
cruel
southrons
had
made
a
general
waste
yet
fearful
of
fresh
incursions
we
and
others
who
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
dug
us
subterraneous
dwellings
and
ever
since
have
lived
like
fairies
in
the
green
hillside
my
son
and
his
young
wife
and
babes
are
now
in
our
cavern
but
reduced
by
sickness
and
want
for
famine
is
here
alas
the
southrons
in
conquering
scotland
have
not
gained
a
kingdom
but
made
a
desert
and
there
is
a
god
who
marks
returned
wallace
i
go
to
reap
the
harvests
of
northumberland
what
our
enemies
have
ravished
hence
in
part
they
shall
refund
a
few
days
and
your
granaries
shall
overflow
meanwhile
i
leave
you
with
my
friend
said
he
pointing
to
murray
at
the
head
of
five
hundred
men
he
may
commence
the
reduction
of
every
english
fortress
that
yet
casts
a
shade
on
the
stream
of
our
native
clyde
for
when
the
sun
next
rises
the
southrons
will
have
passed
the
scottish
borders
and
then
the
truce
expires
gregory
fell
at
his
feet
and
begged
that
he
be
allowed
to
bring
his
nannie
to
see
the
husband
of
her
once
dear
child
not
now
replied
wallace
i
could
not
bear
the
interview
she
shall
see
me
when
i
return
he
then
spoke
apart
to
murray
who
cheerfully
acquiesced
in
a
commission
that
promised
him
not
only
the
glory
of
being
a
conqueror
but
the
private
satisfaction
he
hoped
of
driving
the
southron
garrison
out
of
his
own
paternal
castle
to
send
such
news
to
his
noble
father
at
stirling
would
indeed
be
a
wreath
of
honor
to
his
aged
and
yet
warlike
brow
it
was
then
arranged
between
the
young
chief
and
his
commander
that
watchtowers
should
be
thrown
up
on
every
conspicuous
eminence
which
skirted
the
scottish
borders
whence
concerted
signals
of
victories
or
other
information
might
be
severally
interchanged
these
preliminaries
adjusted
the
regent
bugle
brought
ker
and
sir
john
graham
to
his
side
the
appointed
number
of
men
was
left
with
murray
and
wallace
joining
his
other
chieftains
bade
his
friend
and
honest
servant
adieu
he
now
awakened
to
a
sense
of
the
present
scene
and
speeded
his
legions
over
his
and
dale
till
they
entered
on
the
once
luxuriant
banks
of
the
annan
this
territory
of
some
of
the
noblest
in
scotland
till
bruce
their
chief
deserted
them
it
lay
in
more
terrific
ruin
than
even
the
tracts
he
had
left
there
reigned
the
silence
of
the
tomb
there
existed
the
expiring
agonies
of
men
left
to
perish
recent
marks
of
devastation
smoked
from
the
earth
and
in
the
midst
of
a
barren
waste
a
few
houseless
wretches
rushed
forward
at
the
sight
of
the
regent
threw
themselves
before
his
horse
and
begged
a
morsel
of
food
for
their
famishing
selves
and
dying
infants
look
cried
an
almost
frantic
mother
holding
toward
him
the
living
skeleton
of
a
child
my
husband
was
slain
by
the
southrons
who
hold
lochmaben
castle
my
subsistence
was
carried
away
and
myself
turned
forth
to
give
birth
to
this
child
on
the
rocks
we
have
fed
till
this
hour
on
the
wild
berries
but
i
die
and
my
child
expires
before
me
a
second
group
with
shrieks
of
despair
cried
aloud
here
are
our
young
ones
exposed
to
equal
miseries
give
us
bread
regent
of
scotland
or
we
perish
wallace
turned
to
his
troops
fast
for
a
day
my
brave
friends
cried
he
lay
the
provisions
you
have
brought
with
you
before
these
hapless
people
you
shall
feed
largely
on
southron
tables
he
was
instantly
obeyed
as
his
men
marched
on
they
threw
their
loaded
wallets
amongst
the
famishing
groups
and
followed
by
their
blessings
descended
with
augmented
speed
the
ravaged
hills
of
annandale
dawn
was
brightening
the
dark
head
of
brunswark
as
they
advanced
toward
the
scottish
boundary
at
a
distance
like
a
wreath
of
white
vapors
lay
the
english
camp
along
the
southern
bank
of
the
esk
at
this
sight
wallace
ordered
his
bugles
to
sound
they
were
immediately
answered
by
those
of
the
opposite
host
the
heralds
of
both
armies
advanced
and
the
sun
rising
from
behind
the
eastern
hills
shone
full
upon
the
legions
of
scotland
winding
down
the
romantic
precipices
of
wauchope
two
hours
arranged
every
preliminary
to
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
when
the
clarion
of
the
trumpet
announced
that
each
party
was
to
pass
over
the
river
to
the
side
of
its
respective
country
wallace
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
chieftains
to
receive
the
last
adieus
of
his
illustrious
captives
when
de
warenne
approached
the
regent
took
off
his
helmet
the
southron
had
already
his
in
his
hand
farewell
gallant
scot
said
he
if
aught
could
imbitter
this
moment
of
recovered
freedom
it
is
that
i
leave
a
man
i
so
revere
still
confident
in
a
finally
hopeless
cause
it
would
not
be
the
less
just
were
it
indeed
desparate
replied
wallace
but
had
not
heaven
shown
on
which
side
it
fought
i
should
not
now
have
the
honor
of
thus
bidding
the
brave
de
warenne
farewell
the
earl
passed
on
and
the
other
lords
with
grateful
and
respectful
looks
paid
their
obeisance
the
litter
of
montgomery
drew
near
the
curtains
were
thrown
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
the
prayers
of
sainted
innocence
are
thine
never
more
shall
her
angel
spirit
behold
me
here
as
you
now
behold
me
returned
montgomery
i
must
be
a
traitor
to
virtue
before
i
ever
again
bear
arms
against
sir
william
wallace
wallace
pressed
his
hand
and
they
parted
the
escort
which
guarded
de
valence
advanced
and
the
proud
earl
seeing
where
his
enemy
stood
took
off
his
gauntlet
and
throwing
it
fiercely
toward
him
exclaimed
carry
that
to
your
minion
ruthven
and
tell
him
the
hand
that
wore
it
will
yet
be
tremendously
revenged
as
the
southron
ranks
filed
off
toward
carlisle
those
of
the
returning
scottish
prisoners
approached
their
deliverer
now
it
was
that
the
full
clangor
of
joy
burst
from
every
breast
and
instrument
in
the
scottish
legions
now
it
was
that
the
echoes
rung
with
loud
huzzas
of
long
live
the
valiant
wallace
who
brings
our
nobles
out
of
captivity
long
live
our
matchless
regent
as
these
shouts
rent
the
air
the
lords
badenoch
and
athol
drew
near
the
princely
head
of
the
former
bent
with
proud
acknowledgement
to
the
mild
dignity
of
wallace
badenoch
penetrating
eye
saw
that
it
was
indeed
the
patriotic
guardian
of
his
country
to
whom
he
bowed
and
not
the
vain
affector
of
regal
power
at
his
approach
wallace
alighted
form
his
horse
and
received
his
offered
hand
and
thanks
with
every
grace
inherent
in
his
noble
nature
i
am
happy
returned
he
to
have
been
the
instrument
of
recalling
to
my
country
one
of
the
princes
of
her
royal
blood
and
while
one
drop
of
it
exists
in
scotland
replied
badenoch
its
possessors
must
acknowledge
the
bravest
of
our
defenders
in
sir
william
wallace
athol
next
advanced
but
his
gloomy
countenance
contradicted
his
words
when
he
attempted
to
utter
a
similar
sense
of
obligation
sir
john
monteith
was
eloquent
in
his
thanks
and
sir
william
maitland
was
not
less
sincere
in
his
gratitude
than
wallace
was
in
joy
at
having
given
liberty
to
so
near
a
relation
of
helen
mar
the
rest
of
the
captive
scots
to
the
number
of
several
hundred
were
ready
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
man
who
thus
restored
them
to
their
honors
their
country
and
their
friends
and
wallace
bowed
his
happy
head
under
a
shower
of
blessings
which
poured
on
him
from
a
thousand
grateful
hearts
in
pity
to
the
wearied
travelers
he
ordered
tents
to
be
pitched
and
for
the
sake
of
their
distant
friends
he
dispatched
a
detachment
to
the
top
of
langholm
hill
to
send
forth
a
smoke
in
token
to
the
clydesdale
watch
of
the
armistice
being
ended
he
had
hardly
seen
it
ascend
the
mountain
when
graham
arrived
from
reconnoitering
and
told
him
that
an
english
army
of
great
strength
was
approaching
by
the
foot
of
the
more
southern
hills
to
take
the
reposing
scots
by
surprise
they
shall
find
us
ready
to
receive
them
was
the
prompt
reply
of
wallace
and
his
actions
were
ever
the
companions
of
his
words
leaving
the
scots
to
rest
on
the
banks
of
the
esk
he
put
himself
at
the
head
of
five
thousand
men
and
dispatching
a
thousand
more
with
sir
john
graham
to
pass
the
cheviots
and
be
in
ambush
to
attack
the
southrons
when
he
should
give
the
signal
he
marched
swiftly
forward
and
soon
fell
in
with
some
advanced
squadrons
of
the
enemy
amongst
the
recesses
of
those
hills
little
expecting
such
a
rencounter
they
were
marching
in
defiles
upon
the
lower
ridgy
craigs
to
avoid
the
swamps
which
occupied
the
broader
way
at
sight
of
the
scots
lord
percy
the
southron
commander
ordered
a
party
of
his
archers
to
discharge
their
arrows
the
artillery
of
war
being
thus
opened
afresh
wallace
drew
his
bright
sword
and
waving
it
before
him
just
as
the
sun
set
called
aloud
to
his
followers
his
inspiring
voice
echoed
from
hill
to
hill
and
the
higher
detachments
of
the
scots
pouring
downward
with
the
resistless
impetuosity
of
their
own
mountain
streams
precipitated
their
enemies
into
the
valley
while
wallace
with
his
pikemen
charging
the
horses
in
those
slippery
paths
drove
the
terrified
animals
into
the
morasses
where
some
sunk
at
once
and
others
plunging
threw
their
riders
to
perish
in
the
swamp
desperate
at
the
confusion
which
now
ensued
as
his
archers
fell
headlong
from
the
rocks
and
his
cavalry
lay
drowning
before
him
lord
percy
called
up
his
infantry
they
appeared
but
though
ten
thousand
strong
the
determined
scots
met
their
first
ranks
breast
to
breast
and
leveling
them
with
their
companions
rushed
on
the
rest
with
the
force
of
a
it
was
at
this
period
that
the
signal
was
given
from
the
horn
of
wallace
and
the
division
of
graham
meeting
the
retreating
southrons
as
they
attempted
to
form
behind
the
hill
completed
their
defeat
the
slaughter
became
dreadful
the
victory
decisive
sir
ralph
lattimer
the
second
in
command
was
killed
in
the
first
onset
and
lord
percy
himself
after
fighting
as
became
his
brave
house
fled
covered
with
wounds
toward
alnwick
chapter
xlv
lochmaben
castle
this
being
the
seasons
of
harvest
in
the
northern
counties
of
england
wallace
carried
his
reapers
not
to
lay
their
sickle
to
the
field
but
with
their
swords
to
open
themselves
a
way
into
the
southron
granaries
the
careful
victor
meanwhile
provided
for
the
wants
of
his
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
esk
the
plunder
of
percy
camp
was
dispatched
to
them
which
being
abundant
in
all
kinds
of
provisions
was
more
than
sufficient
to
keep
them
in
ample
store
till
they
could
reach
stirling
from
that
point
the
released
chiefs
had
promised
their
regent
they
would
disperse
to
their
separate
estates
collect
recruits
and
reduce
the
distracted
state
of
the
country
into
some
composed
order
wallace
had
disclosed
his
wish
and
mode
of
effecting
this
renovation
of
public
happiness
before
he
left
stirling
it
contained
a
plan
of
military
organization
by
which
each
youth
able
to
bear
arms
should
not
only
be
instructed
in
the
dexterous
use
of
the
weapons
of
war
but
in
the
duties
of
subordination
and
above
all
have
the
nature
of
the
rights
for
which
he
was
to
contend
explained
to
him
they
only
require
to
be
thoroughly
known
to
be
regarded
as
inestimable
added
he
but
while
we
raise
around
us
the
best
bulwark
of
any
nation
a
brave
and
people
while
we
teach
them
to
defend
their
liberties
let
us
see
that
they
deserve
them
let
them
be
men
contending
for
virtuous
independence
not
savages
fighting
for
licentious
unrestraint
we
must
have
our
youth
of
both
sexes
in
towns
and
villages
from
the
castle
to
the
cot
taught
the
saving
truths
of
christianity
from
that
root
will
branch
all
that
is
needful
to
make
them
useful
members
of
the
and
happy
and
while
war
is
in
our
hands
let
us
in
all
things
prepare
for
peace
that
the
sword
may
gently
bend
into
the
sickle
the
dirk
to
the
there
was
an
expansive
providence
in
all
this
a
concentrating
plan
of
public
weal
which
few
of
the
nobles
had
ever
even
glanced
at
as
a
design
conceivable
for
scotland
there
were
many
of
these
warrior
chiefs
who
could
not
even
understand
it
ah
my
lords
replied
he
to
their
warlike
objections
deceive
not
yourselves
with
the
belief
that
by
the
mere
force
of
arms
a
nation
can
render
itself
great
and
secure
industry
temperance
and
discipline
amongst
the
people
with
moderation
and
justice
in
the
higher
orders
are
the
only
aliments
of
independence
they
bring
you
riches
and
power
which
make
it
the
interest
of
those
who
might
have
been
your
enemies
to
court
your
friendship
the
graver
council
at
stirling
had
received
his
plan
with
enthusiasm
and
when
on
the
day
of
his
parting
with
the
released
chiefs
on
the
banks
of
the
esk
with
all
the
generous
modesty
of
his
nature
he
submitted
his
design
to
them
rather
to
obtain
their
approbation
as
friends
than
to
enforce
it
with
the
authority
of
a
regent
when
they
saw
him
thus
coming
down
from
the
dictatorship
to
which
his
unrivaled
talents
had
raised
him
to
equal
himself
still
with
them
all
were
struck
with
admiration
and
lord
badenoch
could
not
but
mentally
exclaim
the
royal
qualities
of
this
man
can
well
afford
this
expense
of
humility
bend
as
he
will
he
has
only
to
speak
to
show
his
superiority
over
all
and
to
be
sovereign
again
there
was
a
power
in
the
unostentatious
virtues
of
wallace
which
declaring
themselves
rather
in
their
effects
than
by
display
subdued
the
princely
spirit
of
badenoch
and
while
the
proud
chief
recollected
how
he
had
contemned
the
pretensions
of
bruce
and
could
not
brook
the
elevation
of
baliol
how
his
soul
was
in
arms
when
after
he
had
been
persuaded
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
edward
the
throne
was
given
to
one
of
his
rivals
he
wondered
at
himself
to
find
that
his
very
heart
bowed
before
the
gentle
and
comprehensive
wisdom
of
an
untitled
regent
athol
alone
of
the
group
seemed
insensible
to
the
benefits
his
country
was
deriving
from
its
resistless
protector
but
he
expressed
his
dissent
from
the
general
sentiment
with
no
more
visible
sign
than
a
cold
silence
when
the
messenger
from
wallace
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
esk
with
so
large
a
booty
and
the
news
of
his
complete
victory
over
the
gallant
percy
the
exultation
of
the
scottish
nobles
knew
no
bounds
on
badenoch
opening
the
regent
dispatches
he
found
they
repeated
his
wish
for
his
brave
coadjutors
to
proceed
to
the
execution
of
the
plan
they
had
sanctioned
with
their
approbation
they
were
to
march
directly
for
stirling
and
on
their
way
dispense
the
superabundance
of
the
plunder
amongst
the
perishing
inhabitants
of
the
land
he
then
informed
the
earl
that
while
the
guard
he
had
left
him
with
would
escort
the
liberated
scots
beyond
the
forth
the
remainder
of
the
troops
should
be
thus
disposed
lord
andrew
murray
was
to
remain
chief
in
command
in
clydesdale
sir
eustace
maxwell
to
give
up
the
wardship
of
douglas
to
sir
john
monteith
and
then
advance
into
annandale
to
assist
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
who
must
now
have
begun
the
reduction
of
the
castles
in
the
west
of
that
province
at
the
close
of
this
account
wallace
added
that
himself
with
his
brave
band
were
going
to
traverse
the
english
counties
to
the
tees
mouth
and
should
heaven
bless
his
arms
he
would
send
the
produce
round
by
the
berwick
fleet
to
replenish
the
exhausted
stores
of
the
highlands
next
year
continued
he
i
trust
they
will
have
ample
harvests
of
their
own
and
what
wallace
said
he
hoped
to
do
he
did
the
southrons
country
was
at
the
defeat
of
percy
his
beaten
army
flying
in
all
directions
before
the
conquering
legions
gave
such
dreadful
and
hyperbolical
accounts
of
their
might
and
of
the
giant
prowess
of
their
leader
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
scottish
spears
were
seen
rising
the
summit
of
any
hill
or
even
gleaming
along
the
horizon
every
village
was
deserted
every
cot
left
without
inhabitant
and
corn
and
cattle
and
every
kind
of
property
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
scots
lord
precy
lay
immovable
with
wounds
in
his
castle
at
alnwick
and
his
hopeless
state
by
intimidating
his
followers
contradicted
the
orders
he
gave
to
face
the
marauding
enemy
several
times
they
attempted
to
obey
but
as
often
showed
their
inability
they
collected
under
arms
but
the
moment
their
foe
appeared
they
fled
within
the
castle
walls
or
buried
themselves
in
deep
obscurities
amongst
the
surrounding
hills
not
a
sheaf
in
the
fields
of
northumberland
did
the
scots
leave
to
knead
into
bread
for
its
earl
not
a
head
of
cattle
to
smoke
upon
his
board
the
country
was
sacked
from
sea
to
sea
but
far
different
was
its
appearance
from
that
of
the
trampled
valleys
of
scotland
there
fire
had
burned
up
the
soil
the
hand
of
violence
had
leveled
the
husbandman
cottage
had
buried
his
implements
in
the
ruins
had
sacrificed
himself
on
its
smoking
ashes
there
the
fatherless
babe
wept
its
unavailing
wants
and
at
its
side
sat
the
distracted
widow
wringing
her
hands
in
speechless
misery
for
there
lay
her
murdered
husband
here
her
perishing
child
famous
castle
of
so
many
heroic
generations
is
still
the
princely
residence
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
percy
with
such
sights
the
heart
of
wallace
had
been
pierced
when
he
passed
through
the
lowland
counties
of
his
country
nay
as
he
scoured
the
highland
districts
of
the
grampians
even
there
had
he
met
the
foot
of
barbarian
man
and
cruel
desolation
for
thus
it
was
that
the
southron
garrisons
had
provisional
themselves
by
robbing
the
poor
of
their
bread
and
when
they
resisted
firing
their
dwellings
and
punishing
the
refractory
with
death
but
not
so
the
generous
enmity
of
sir
william
wallace
his
commission
was
not
to
destroy
but
to
save
and
though
he
carried
his
victorious
army
to
feed
on
the
southron
plains
and
sent
the
harvests
of
england
to
restore
the
wasted
fields
of
scotland
yet
he
did
no
more
no
fire
blasted
his
path
no
innocent
blood
cried
against
him
from
the
ground
when
the
impetuous
zeal
of
his
soldiers
flushed
with
victory
and
in
the
heat
of
vengeance
would
have
laid
several
hamlets
in
ashes
he
seized
the
brand
from
the
destroying
party
and
throwing
it
into
an
adjoining
brook
show
yourselves
worthy
the
advantages
you
have
gained
cried
he
by
the
moderation
with
which
you
use
them
consider
yourselves
as
the
soldiers
of
the
all
powerful
god
who
alone
has
conducted
you
to
victory
for
with
a
few
has
he
not
enabled
us
to
subdue
a
host
behave
as
becomes
your
high
destiny
and
debase
not
yourselves
by
imitating
the
hirelings
of
ambition
who
receive
as
the
wages
of
their
valor
the
base
privilege
to
ravage
and
to
murder
i
wish
you
to
distinguish
between
a
spirit
of
reprisal
in
what
i
do
and
that
of
retaliation
which
actuates
your
present
violence
what
our
enemies
had
robbed
us
of
as
far
as
they
can
restore
i
take
again
their
bread
shall
feed
our
famishing
country
their
wool
clothe
its
nakedness
but
blood
for
blood
unless
the
murderer
could
be
made
to
bleed
is
a
doctrine
abhorrent
to
god
and
to
humanity
what
justice
is
there
in
destroying
the
habitations
and
lives
of
a
set
of
harmless
people
because
the
like
cruelty
has
been
committed
by
a
lawless
army
of
their
countrymen
upon
our
unoffending
brethren
your
hearts
may
make
the
answer
but
if
they
are
hardened
against
the
pleadings
of
humanity
let
prudence
show
your
interest
in
leaving
those
men
alive
and
with
their
means
unimpaired
who
will
produce
other
harvests
if
need
be
to
fill
our
scantier
granaries
thus
i
reason
with
you
and
i
hope
many
are
convinced
but
they
who
are
insensible
to
argument
must
fear
authority
and
i
declare
that
every
man
who
inflicts
injury
on
the
houses
or
on
the
persons
of
the
quietest
peasantry
of
this
land
shall
be
punished
as
a
traitor
to
the
state
according
to
the
different
dispositions
of
men
this
reasoning
prevailed
and
from
the
end
of
september
the
time
when
wallace
first
entered
northumberland
to
the
month
of
november
when
having
scoured
the
counties
of
england
even
to
the
gates
of
york
he
returned
to
scotland
not
an
offense
was
committed
which
could
occasion
his
merciful
spirit
regret
it
was
on
all
saints
day
when
he
again
approached
the
esk
and
so
great
was
his
spoil
that
his
return
seemed
more
like
some
vast
caravan
moving
the
merchandise
of
half
the
world
than
the
march
of
an
army
which
had
so
lately
passed
that
river
a
famishing
though
valourous
host
the
outposts
of
carlaveroch
soon
informed
maxwell
the
lord
regent
was
in
sight
at
the
joyful
intelligence
a
double
smoke
streamed
from
every
in
annandale
and
sir
eustace
had
hardly
appeared
on
the
solway
bank
to
meet
his
triumphant
chief
when
the
eager
speed
of
the
rough
knight
of
torthorald
brought
him
there
also
wallace
as
his
proud
charger
plunged
into
the
ford
and
the
heavy
wagons
groaned
after
him
was
welcomed
to
the
shore
by
the
shouts
not
only
of
the
soldiers
which
had
followed
maxwell
and
kirkpatrick
but
by
the
people
who
came
in
crowds
to
hail
their
preserver
the
squalid
hue
of
famine
had
left
every
face
and
each
smiling
countenance
beaming
with
health
security
and
gratitude
told
wallace
more
emphatically
than
a
thousand
tongues
the
wisdom
of
the
means
he
had
used
to
regenerate
his
country
maxwell
had
prepared
the
fortress
of
lochmaben
once
the
residence
of
bruce
for
the
reception
of
the
regent
and
thither
wallace
was
conducted
in
prouder
triumph
than
ever
followed
the
of
caesar
blessings
were
the
clarions
that
preceeded
him
and
hosts
of
people
whom
he
had
saved
when
ready
to
perish
were
voluntary
actors
in
his
pageant
when
he
arrived
in
sight
of
the
two
capacious
lochs
which
spread
like
lucid
wings
on
each
side
of
the
castle
he
turned
to
graham
what
pity
said
he
that
the
rightful
owner
of
his
truly
regal
dwelling
does
not
act
as
becomes
his
blood
he
might
now
be
entering
its
gates
as
king
and
scotland
find
rest
under
its
lawful
monarch
but
he
prefers
being
a
parasite
in
the
court
of
a
tyrant
replied
sir
john
and
from
such
a
school
scotland
would
reject
its
king
but
he
has
a
son
replied
wallace
a
brave
and
generous
son
i
am
told
by
lord
montgomery
who
knew
him
in
guienne
that
a
nobler
spirit
does
not
exist
on
his
brows
my
dear
graham
we
must
hope
one
day
to
see
the
crown
then
only
as
your
heir
my
lord
regent
interrupted
maxwell
for
while
you
live
i
can
answer
for
it
that
no
scot
will
acknowledge
any
other
ruler
i
will
first
eat
my
own
sword
cried
kirkpatrick
at
this
moment
the
portcullis
of
the
gate
was
raised
and
maxwell
falling
back
to
make
way
for
the
regent
wallace
had
not
time
to
answer
a
sentiment
now
so
familiar
to
him
by
hearing
it
from
every
grateful
heart
that
he
hardly
remarked
its
tendency
a
fact
the
more
easily
to
be
believed
from
the
ambition
of
such
reward
never
receiving
acceptance
in
his
mind
ever
pressing
toward
establishing
the
happiness
of
his
country
he
hastened
over
the
splendid
repast
that
was
prepared
for
him
and
dispensing
with
the
ceremonials
with
which
the
zeal
of
maxwell
sought
to
display
his
respect
for
the
virtues
and
station
of
his
commander
he
retired
with
graham
to
write
dispatches
and
to
apportion
shares
of
the
spoil
to
the
necessities
of
the
provinces
in
these
duties
his
wakeful
eye
was
kept
open
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
they
for
whom
he
labored
slept
securely
that
thought
was
rest
to
him
but
they
closed
not
their
eyes
without
praying
for
the
sweet
repose
of
their
benefactor
and
he
found
it
not
in
sleep
but
in
that
peace
of
heart
which
the
world
can
not
give
chapter
xlvi
lammington
day
succeeded
day
in
the
execution
of
these
beneficial
designs
when
fulfilled
the
royal
halls
of
lochmaben
did
not
long
detain
him
who
knew
no
satisfaction
but
when
going
about
doing
good
while
he
was
thus
employed
raising
with
the
quickness
of
magic
by
the
hands
of
his
soldiers
the
lately
ruined
hamlets
into
villages
while
the
gray
smoke
curled
from
a
thousand
russet
cottages
which
now
spotted
the
sides
of
the
hills
while
all
the
lowlands
whithersoever
he
directed
his
steps
breathed
of
comfort
and
abundance
he
felt
like
the
father
of
a
large
family
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
and
vast
home
where
every
eye
turned
on
him
with
reverence
every
lip
with
gratitude
he
had
hardly
gone
the
circuit
of
these
now
cheerful
valleys
when
an
embassy
from
england
which
had
first
touched
at
lochmaben
overtook
him
at
the
tower
of
lammington
the
ambassadors
were
edmund
earl
of
arundel
a
nobleman
who
had
married
the
only
sister
of
de
warenne
and
anthony
beck
bishop
of
durham
at
the
moment
their
splendid
cavalcade
escorted
by
a
party
from
sir
eustace
maxwell
entered
the
gate
of
lammington
wallace
was
in
the
hourly
expectation
of
edwin
and
hearing
the
trampling
of
horses
he
hastened
into
the
courtyard
attended
by
gregory
grandchildren
one
was
in
his
arms
two
others
held
by
his
plaid
and
a
third
played
with
the
sword
he
had
unbuckled
from
his
side
it
was
a
clear
frosty
day
and
the
keenness
of
the
air
brightened
the
complexion
of
wallace
while
it
deepened
the
roses
of
his
infant
companions
the
leader
of
the
scottish
escort
immediately
proclaimed
to
the
embassadors
that
this
was
the
regent
at
the
sight
of
so
uncourtly
a
scene
the
haughty
prelate
of
durham
drew
back
this
man
will
not
understand
his
own
interest
said
he
in
a
disdainful
whisper
to
lord
arundel
i
am
inclined
to
think
his
estimation
of
it
will
be
beyond
ours
as
the
earl
made
this
reply
the
officer
of
maxwell
informed
wallace
of
the
names
and
errand
of
the
illustrious
strangers
at
the
mention
of
a
southron
the
elder
children
ran
screaming
into
the
house
leaving
the
youngest
who
continued
on
the
breast
of
wallace
the
bishop
drew
near
we
come
sir
william
wallace
cried
the
prelate
in
a
tone
whose
lordly
pitch
lowered
when
his
surprised
eye
saw
the
princely
dignity
which
shone
over
the
countenance
of
the
man
whose
domestic
appearance
when
descried
at
a
distance
had
excited
his
contempt
we
come
from
the
king
of
england
with
a
message
for
your
private
ear
and
i
hope
gallant
chief
joined
lord
arundel
what
we
have
to
impart
will
give
peace
to
both
nations
and
establish
in
honor
the
most
generous
as
well
as
the
bravest
of
enemies
wallace
bowed
to
the
earl
compliment
he
knew
by
his
title
that
he
must
be
the
brother
of
de
warenne
and
resigning
the
child
into
the
arms
of
graham
with
a
graceful
welcome
he
conducted
the
southron
lords
into
the
hall
lord
arundel
looking
around
said
are
we
alone
sir
william
perfectly
he
replied
and
i
am
ready
to
receive
any
proposals
for
peace
which
the
rights
of
scotland
will
allow
her
to
accept
the
earl
drew
from
his
bosom
a
gold
casket
and
laying
it
on
a
table
before
him
addressed
the
regent
sir
william
wallace
i
come
to
you
not
with
the
denunciation
of
an
implacable
liege
lord
whom
a
rash
vassal
has
offended
but
in
the
grace
of
the
most
generous
of
monarchs
anxious
to
convert
a
brave
insurgent
into
the
loyal
friend
my
lord
the
king
having
heard
by
letters
from
my
the
earl
de
warenne
of
the
honorable
manner
with
which
you
treated
the
english
whom
the
fate
of
battle
threw
into
your
power
his
majesty
instead
of
sending
over
from
flanders
a
mighty
army
to
overwhelm
this
rebellious
kingdom
has
deputed
me
even
as
an
embassador
to
reason
with
the
rashness
he
is
ready
to
pardon
also
with
this
diadem
continued
the
earl
drawing
a
circlet
of
jewels
from
the
casket
which
my
brave
sovereign
tore
from
the
brows
of
a
saracen
prince
on
the
ramparts
of
acre
he
sends
the
assurance
of
his
regard
for
the
heroic
virtues
of
his
enemy
and
to
these
jewels
he
will
add
a
more
efficient
crown
if
sir
william
wallace
will
awake
from
this
trance
of
false
enthusiasm
and
acknowledge
as
he
is
in
duty
bound
to
do
the
supremacy
of
england
over
this
country
speak
but
the
word
noblest
of
scots
added
the
earl
and
the
bishop
of
durham
has
orders
from
the
generous
edward
immediately
to
anoint
you
king
of
scotland
that
done
my
royal
master
will
support
you
in
your
throne
against
every
man
who
may
dare
in
dispute
your
authority
at
these
words
wallace
rose
from
his
seat
my
lord
said
he
since
i
took
up
arms
for
injured
scotland
i
have
been
used
to
look
into
the
hearts
of
men
i
therefore
estimate
with
every
due
respect
the
compliment
which
this
message
of
your
king
pays
to
my
virtues
had
he
thought
that
i
deserved
the
confidence
of
scotland
he
would
not
have
insulted
me
with
offering
a
price
for
my
allegiance
to
be
even
a
crowned
vassal
of
king
edward
is
far
beneath
my
ambition
take
back
the
saracen
diadem
it
shall
never
dishonor
the
brows
of
him
who
has
sworn
by
the
cross
to
maintain
the
independence
of
scotland
or
to
lay
down
his
life
in
the
struggle
weigh
well
brave
sir
resumed
the
earl
the
consequences
of
this
answer
edward
will
soon
be
in
england
he
will
march
hither
himself
not
at
the
head
of
such
armies
as
you
have
discomfited
but
with
countless
legions
and
when
he
falls
upon
any
country
in
indignation
the
places
of
its
cities
are
known
no
more
better
for
a
brave
people
so
to
perish
replied
wallace
than
to
exist
in
dishonor
what
dishonor
noble
scot
can
accrue
from
acknowledging
the
supremacy
of
your
liege
lord
or
to
what
can
the
proudest
ambition
in
scotland
extend
beyond
that
of
possessing
its
throne
i
am
not
such
a
slave
cried
wallace
as
to
prefer
what
men
might
call
aggrandizement
before
the
higher
destiny
of
preserving
to
my
country
its
birthright
independence
to
be
the
guardian
of
her
laws
and
of
the
individual
right
of
every
man
born
on
scottish
ground
is
my
ambition
ill
should
i
perform
the
one
duty
were
i
to
wrong
the
posterity
of
alexander
by
invading
their
throne
and
horrible
would
be
my
treason
against
the
other
could
i
sell
my
confiding
country
for
a
name
and
a
bauble
into
the
grasp
of
a
usurper
brand
not
with
so
unjust
an
epithet
the
munificent
edward
interrupted
lord
arundel
let
your
own
noble
nature
be
a
witness
of
his
put
from
you
all
the
prejudice
which
the
ill
conduct
of
his
officers
have
excited
and
you
must
perceive
that
in
accepting
his
terms
you
will
best
repay
your
country
confidence
by
giving
it
peace
so
great
would
be
my
damning
sin
in
such
an
acceptance
cried
wallace
that
i
should
be
abhorred
by
god
and
man
you
talk
of
noble
minds
earl
look
into
your
own
and
will
it
not
tell
you
that
in
the
moment
a
people
bring
themselves
to
put
the
command
of
their
actions
and
with
that
their
consciences
into
the
hands
of
a
usurper
and
that
edward
is
one
in
scotland
our
annals
and
his
tyrannies
declare
they
sell
their
birthright
and
become
unworthy
the
name
of
men
in
that
deed
they
abjure
the
gift
with
which
god
had
intrusted
them
and
justly
the
angels
of
his
host
depart
from
them
you
know
the
sacred
axiom
virtue
is
better
than
life
by
that
we
are
commanded
to
preserve
the
one
at
the
expense
of
the
other
and
we
are
ready
to
obey
neither
the
threats
nor
the
blandishments
of
edward
have
power
to
shake
the
resolves
of
those
who
draw
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
rebellious
man
exclaimed
beck
who
had
listened
impatiently
and
whose
haughty
spirit
could
ill
brook
such
towering
language
being
directed
to
his
sovereign
since
you
dare
quote
scripture
to
sanction
crime
hear
my
embassage
to
meet
the
possibility
of
this
flagitious
obstinacy
i
came
armed
with
the
thunder
of
the
church
and
the
indignation
of
a
justly
incensed
monarch
accept
his
most
gracious
offers
delivered
to
you
by
the
earl
of
arundel
here
is
the
cross
to
receive
your
oath
of
fealty
cried
he
stretching
it
forth
as
if
he
thought
his
commands
were
irrestible
but
beware
keep
it
with
a
truer
faith
than
did
the
traitor
baliol
or
expect
the
malediction
of
heaven
the
exterminating
vengeance
of
your
liege
lord
wallace
was
not
discomposed
by
this
attack
from
the
stormy
prelate
my
lord
of
durham
replied
he
with
his
usual
tranquil
air
had
your
sovereign
sent
me
such
proposals
as
became
a
just
king
and
were
possible
for
an
honest
scot
to
admit
he
should
have
found
me
ready
to
have
treated
him
with
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
and
honor
but
when
he
demands
the
sacrifice
of
my
integrity
when
he
asks
me
to
sign
a
deed
that
would
again
spread
this
renovated
land
with
devastation
were
i
to
consider
the
glozing
language
of
his
embassy
as
grace
and
nobleness
i
should
belie
my
own
truth
which
tramples
alike
on
his
menaces
and
his
pretended
claims
and
i
ask
you
priest
of
heaven
is
he
a
god
greater
than
jehovah
that
i
should
fear
him
and
durst
thou
presume
audacious
rebel
exclaimed
beck
that
the
light
of
israel
deign
to
shine
on
a
barbarian
nation
in
arms
against
a
hero
of
the
cross
reprobate
that
thou
art
answer
to
thine
own
condemnation
does
not
the
church
declare
the
claims
of
edward
to
be
just
and
who
dare
gainsay
her
decrees
the
voice
of
him
you
pretend
to
serve
he
is
no
respecter
of
persons
he
raises
the
poor
from
the
dust
and
by
his
arm
the
tyrant
and
his
host
are
plunged
into
the
whelming
waves
bishop
i
know
in
whom
i
trust
is
the
minister
greater
than
his
lord
that
i
should
believe
the
word
of
a
synod
against
the
declared
will
of
god
neither
anathema
nor
armed
thousands
shall
make
me
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
edward
he
may
conquer
the
body
but
the
soul
of
a
patriot
he
can
never
subdue
then
cried
beck
suddenly
rising
black
with
choler
and
stretching
his
crosier
over
the
head
of
wallace
as
the
rod
of
moses
shed
plagues
miseries
and
death
over
the
land
of
egypt
i
invoke
the
like
judgments
to
fall
on
this
rebellious
land
on
its
blasphemous
leader
and
thus
i
leave
it
my
curse
wallace
smiled
as
the
terrific
words
fell
from
the
lips
of
this
demon
in
sacred
guise
lord
arundel
observed
him
you
despise
this
malediction
sir
william
wallace
i
thought
more
piety
had
dwelt
with
so
much
military
nobleness
i
should
not
regard
the
curses
of
a
congregated
world
replied
wallace
when
my
conscience
as
loudly
proclaims
that
god
is
on
my
side
and
is
he
not
omniscient
that
he
should
be
swayed
by
the
prejudices
of
men
does
he
not
read
the
heart
is
he
not
master
of
all
causes
and
shall
i
shrink
when
i
know
that
i
hold
his
commission
shall
i
not
regard
those
anathemas
even
as
the
artillery
with
which
the
adversary
would
drive
me
from
my
post
but
did
the
clouds
rain
fire
and
the
earth
open
beneath
me
i
would
not
stir
for
i
know
who
planted
me
here
and
as
long
as
he
wills
me
to
stand
neither
men
nor
devils
can
move
me
hence
thou
art
incorrigible
cried
beck
i
would
say
firm
rejoined
arundel
overawed
by
the
majesty
of
virtue
could
i
regard
as
he
does
the
cause
he
has
espoused
but
as
it
is
noble
wallace
continued
he
i
must
regret
your
infatuation
and
instead
of
the
peace
i
thought
to
leave
with
you
hurl
war
extirpating
war
upon
the
head
of
this
devoted
nation
as
he
spoke
he
threw
his
against
the
opposite
wall
in
which
it
stuck
and
stood
shivering
then
taking
up
the
casket
with
its
splendid
contents
he
replaced
it
in
his
bosom
throw
a
spear
was
an
ancient
mode
of
denouncing
war
beck
had
turned
away
in
wrath
from
the
table
and
advancing
with
a
magisterial
step
to
the
door
he
threw
it
open
as
if
he
thought
that
longer
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
the
person
he
had
excommunicated
would
infect
him
with
his
own
curses
on
opening
the
door
a
group
of
scots
who
waited
in
the
antechamber
hastened
forward
at
the
sight
of
the
prelate
they
raised
their
bonnets
and
hesitated
to
pass
he
stood
on
the
threshold
proudly
neglectful
of
their
respect
in
the
next
minute
wallace
appeared
with
lord
arundel
brave
knight
said
the
earl
the
adieus
of
a
man
as
sensible
of
your
private
worth
as
he
regrets
the
errors
of
your
public
opinion
abide
with
you
were
edward
sensible
to
virtue
like
his
brave
subjects
replied
the
chief
i
should
not
fear
that
another
drop
of
blood
need
be
shed
in
scotland
to
convince
him
of
his
present
injustice
farewell
noble
earl
the
generous
candor
of
yourself
and
of
your
will
ever
live
in
the
remembrance
of
william
wallace
while
he
yet
spoke
a
youth
broke
from
the
group
before
them
and
rushing
toward
the
regent
threw
himself
with
a
cry
of
joy
at
his
feet
my
edwin
my
brother
exclaimed
wallace
and
immediately
raising
him
clasped
him
in
his
arms
the
throng
of
scots
who
had
accompanied
their
young
leader
from
stirling
now
crowded
about
the
chief
some
kneeling
and
kissing
his
garments
others
ejaculating
with
uplifting
hands
their
thanks
at
seeing
their
protector
in
safety
and
with
redoubled
glory
you
forgive
me
my
master
and
friend
cried
edwin
forgetting
in
the
happy
agitation
of
his
mind
the
presence
of
the
english
embassadors
it
was
only
as
a
master
i
condemned
you
my
brother
returned
wallace
every
proof
of
your
affection
must
render
you
dearer
to
me
and
had
it
been
exerted
against
an
offender
not
so
totally
in
my
power
you
would
not
have
met
my
reprimand
but
ever
remember
that
the
persons
of
prisoners
are
inviolable
for
they
lie
on
the
bosom
of
mercy
and
who
that
has
honor
would
take
them
thence
lord
arundel
who
had
lingered
to
observe
this
short
but
animated
scene
now
ventured
to
interrupt
it
may
i
ask
noble
wallace
said
he
if
this
interesting
youth
be
the
brave
young
ruthven
who
distinguished
himself
at
dumbarton
and
who
de
warenne
told
me
incurred
a
severe
though
just
sentence
from
you
in
consequence
of
his
attack
upon
one
whom
as
a
soldier
i
blush
to
name
it
is
the
same
replied
wallace
the
valor
and
fidelity
of
such
as
he
are
as
sinews
to
my
arms
and
bring
a
more
grateful
empire
to
my
heart
than
all
the
crowns
which
may
be
in
the
power
of
edward
to
bestow
i
have
often
seen
the
homage
of
the
body
said
the
earl
but
here
i
see
that
of
the
soul
and
were
i
a
king
i
should
envy
sir
william
wallace
this
speech
is
that
of
a
courtier
or
a
traitor
suddenly
exclaimed
beck
turning
with
a
threatening
brow
on
lord
arundel
beware
earl
for
what
has
now
been
said
must
be
repeated
to
the
royal
edward
and
he
will
judge
whether
flattery
to
this
proud
rebel
be
consistent
with
your
allegiance
every
word
that
has
been
uttered
in
this
i
will
myself
deliver
to
king
edward
replied
lord
arundel
he
shall
know
the
man
on
whom
he
may
be
forced
by
justice
to
denounce
the
sentence
of
rebellion
and
when
the
pruissance
of
his
royal
arm
lays
this
kingdom
at
his
feet
the
virtues
of
sir
william
wallace
may
then
find
the
clemency
he
now
contemns
beck
did
not
condescend
to
listen
to
the
latter
part
of
this
explanation
but
proceeding
to
the
had
mounted
his
horse
before
his
worthier
colleague
appeared
from
the
hall
taking
a
gracious
leave
of
sir
john
graham
who
attended
him
to
the
door
the
earl
exclaimed
what
miracle
is
before
me
not
the
mighty
mover
only
of
this
wide
insurrection
is
in
the
bloom
of
manhood
but
all
his
general
that
i
have
seen
appear
in
the
very
morning
of
youth
and
you
conquer
our
veterans
by
long
experience
and
hairs
grown
gray
in
camps
and
battles
then
by
our
morning
judge
what
our
day
may
be
replied
graham
and
show
your
monarch
that
as
surely
as
the
night
of
death
will
in
some
hour
close
upon
prince
and
peasant
this
land
shall
never
again
be
overshadowed
by
his
darkness
listen
not
to
their
bold
treasons
cried
beck
and
setting
spurs
to
his
horse
in
no
very
clerical
style
he
galloped
out
of
the
gates
arundel
made
some
courteous
reply
to
graham
then
bowing
to
the
rest
of
the
scottish
officers
who
stood
around
turned
his
steed
and
followed
by
his
escort
pursued
the
steps
of
the
bishop
along
the
banks
of
the
clyde
chapter
xlvii
lammington
when
wallace
was
left
alone
with
edwin
the
happy
youth
after
expressing
delight
that
murray
then
held
his
headquarters
in
bothwell
castle
took
from
his
bosom
two
packets
one
from
lord
mar
the
other
from
the
countess
my
dear
cousin
said
he
has
sent
you
many
blessings
but
i
could
not
persuade
her
to
register
even
one
on
paper
while
my
aunt
wrote
all
this
almost
ever
since
her
own
recovery
helen
has
confined
herself
to
my
uncle
sick
chamber
now
totally
deserted
by
the
fair
countess
who
seems
to
have
forgotten
all
duties
in
the
adulation
of
the
wallace
remarked
on
the
indisposition
of
mar
and
the
attention
of
his
daughter
with
tenderness
and
edwin
with
the
unrestrained
vivacity
of
happy
friendship
proceeded
sportively
to
describe
the
regal
style
which
the
countess
had
affected
and
the
absurd
group
with
which
she
had
welcomed
the
earls
badenoch
and
athol
to
their
native
country
indeed
continued
he
i
can
not
guess
what
vain
idea
has
taken
possession
of
her
but
when
i
went
to
snawdoun
to
receive
her
commands
for
you
i
found
her
seated
on
a
kind
of
throne
with
ladies
standing
in
her
presence
and
our
younger
chieftains
thronging
the
gallery
as
if
she
were
the
regent
himself
helen
entered
for
a
moment
but
amazed
started
back
never
before
having
witnessed
the
morning
courts
of
stepmother
but
edwin
did
not
relate
to
his
friend
all
that
had
passed
in
the
succeeding
conference
between
him
and
his
gentle
cousin
blushing
for
her
father
wife
helen
would
have
retired
immediately
to
her
own
apartments
but
edwin
drew
her
into
one
of
lady
mar
rooms
and
seating
her
beside
him
began
to
speak
of
his
anticipated
meeting
with
wallace
he
held
her
hand
in
his
my
dearest
cousin
said
he
will
not
this
tender
hand
which
has
suffered
so
much
for
our
brave
friend
write
him
one
word
of
kind
remembrance
our
queen
here
will
send
him
volumes
then
he
would
hardly
have
time
to
attend
to
one
of
mine
replied
helen
with
a
smile
besides
he
requires
no
new
assurance
to
convince
him
that
helen
mar
can
never
cease
to
remember
her
benefactor
with
the
most
grateful
thoughts
and
is
this
all
i
am
to
say
to
him
helen
all
my
edwin
what
not
one
word
of
the
life
you
have
led
since
he
quitted
stirling
shall
i
not
tell
him
that
when
this
lovely
arm
no
longer
wore
the
livery
of
its
heroism
in
his
behalf
instead
of
your
appearing
at
the
gay
assemblies
of
the
countess
you
remained
immured
within
your
oratory
shall
i
not
tell
him
that
since
the
sickness
of
my
uncle
you
have
sat
days
and
nights
by
his
listening
to
the
dispatches
from
the
borders
subscribing
with
smiles
and
tears
to
his
praises
of
our
matchless
regent
shall
i
not
tell
him
of
the
sweet
maid
who
lives
here
the
life
of
a
nun
for
him
or
must
i
entertain
him
with
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
my
most
unsaintly
aunt
helen
had
in
vain
attempted
to
stop
him
while
with
an
arch
glance
at
her
mantling
blushes
he
half
whispered
these
insidious
questions
ah
my
sweet
cousin
there
is
something
more
at
the
bottom
of
that
beating
heart
than
you
will
allow
your
faithful
edwin
to
peep
into
helen
heart
did
beat
violently
both
before
and
after
this
remark
but
conscious
whatever
might
be
there
of
the
determined
purpose
of
her
soul
she
turned
on
him
a
steady
look
edwin
said
she
there
is
nothing
in
my
heart
that
you
may
not
see
that
it
reveres
sir
william
wallace
beyond
all
other
men
i
do
not
deny
but
class
not
my
deep
veneration
with
a
sentiment
which
may
be
jested
on
he
has
spoken
to
me
the
language
of
friendship
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
his
friend
and
having
tasted
of
heaven
i
can
not
stoop
to
earth
what
pleasure
can
i
find
in
pageants
interest
in
the
admiration
of
men
is
not
his
esteem
of
a
value
that
puts
to
naught
the
homages
of
all
else
in
the
world
do
me
then
justice
my
edwin
believe
me
i
am
no
gloomy
no
sighing
recluse
i
am
happy
with
my
thoughts
and
thrice
happy
at
the
side
of
my
father
couch
for
there
i
meet
the
image
of
the
most
exemplary
of
human
beings
and
there
i
perform
the
duties
of
a
child
to
a
parent
deserving
all
my
love
and
honor
ah
helen
helen
cried
edwin
dare
i
speak
the
wish
of
my
heart
but
you
and
sir
william
wallace
would
frown
on
me
and
i
may
not
then
never
utter
it
exclaimed
helen
turning
pale
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
too
well
guessing
by
the
generous
glow
in
his
countenance
what
would
have
been
that
wish
at
this
instant
the
door
opened
and
lady
mar
appeared
both
rose
at
her
entrance
she
bowed
her
head
coldly
to
helen
to
edwin
she
graciously
extended
her
hand
why
my
dear
nephew
did
you
not
come
into
the
edwin
answered
smiling
that
as
he
did
not
know
the
governor
of
stirling
lady
lived
in
the
state
of
a
queen
he
hoped
he
should
be
excused
for
mistaking
lords
and
ladies
in
waiting
for
company
and
for
that
reason
having
retired
till
he
could
bid
her
adieu
in
a
less
public
scene
lady
mar
with
much
stateliness
replied
perhaps
it
is
necessary
to
remind
you
edwin
that
i
am
more
than
lord
mar
wife
i
am
not
only
heiress
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
northern
isles
but
like
badenoch
am
of
the
blood
of
the
scottish
kings
to
conceal
an
irrepressible
laugh
at
this
proud
folly
in
a
woman
otherwise
of
shrewd
understanding
edwin
turned
toward
the
window
but
not
before
the
countess
had
observed
the
ridicule
which
played
on
his
lips
vexed
but
afraid
to
reprimand
one
who
might
so
soon
resent
it
by
speaking
of
her
disparagingly
to
wallace
she
unburdened
the
swelling
of
her
anger
upon
the
unoffending
helen
not
doubting
that
she
felt
as
edwin
did
and
fancying
that
she
saw
the
same
expression
in
her
countenance
lady
helen
cried
she
i
request
an
explanation
of
that
look
of
derision
which
i
now
see
on
your
face
i
wish
to
know
whether
the
intoxication
of
your
vanity
dare
impel
you
to
despise
claims
which
may
one
day
be
established
to
your
confusion
this
attack
surprised
helen
who
absorbed
in
other
meditations
had
scarcely
heard
her
mother
words
to
edwin
i
neither
deride
you
lady
mar
nor
despise
the
claims
of
your
kinsman
badenoch
but
since
you
have
condescended
to
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
i
must
out
of
respect
to
yourself
and
duty
to
my
father
frankly
say
that
the
assumption
of
honors
not
legally
in
your
possession
may
excite
ridicule
on
him
and
even
trouble
to
our
cause
provoked
at
the
just
reasoning
of
this
reply
and
at
being
misapprehended
with
regard
to
the
object
with
whom
she
hoped
to
share
all
the
reflected
splendors
of
a
throne
lady
mar
answered
rather
inconsiderately
your
father
is
an
old
man
and
has
outlived
every
noble
emulation
he
neither
understands
my
actions
nor
shall
he
control
them
struck
dumb
by
this
unexpected
declaration
helen
suffered
her
to
proceed
and
as
to
lord
badenoch
giving
me
the
rank
to
which
my
birth
entitled
me
that
is
a
foolish
dream
i
look
to
a
greater
hand
what
inquired
edwin
with
a
playful
bow
does
my
highness
aunt
expect
my
uncle
to
die
and
that
bruce
will
come
hither
to
lay
the
crown
of
scotland
at
her
feet
i
expect
nothing
of
bruce
nor
of
your
uncle
returned
she
with
a
haughty
rearing
of
her
head
but
i
look
for
respect
from
the
daughter
of
lord
mar
and
from
the
friend
of
sir
william
wallace
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
presenting
edwin
with
a
packet
for
wallace
told
helen
she
might
retire
to
her
own
room
to
my
father
i
will
madam
returned
she
lady
mar
colored
at
this
reproof
and
turning
to
edwin
more
gently
said
you
know
that
the
dignity
of
his
situation
must
be
maintained
and
while
others
attend
his
couch
i
must
his
reputation
i
have
often
heard
that
is
better
than
life
replied
edwin
still
smiling
and
i
thank
lady
mar
for
showing
me
how
differently
people
may
translate
the
same
lesson
adieu
dear
helen
said
he
touching
her
mantling
cheek
with
his
lips
farewell
returned
she
may
good
angels
guard
you
the
substance
of
the
latter
part
of
this
scene
edwin
did
relate
to
wallace
he
smiled
at
the
vain
follies
of
the
countess
and
broke
the
seal
of
her
letter
it
was
in
the
same
style
with
her
conversation
at
one
moment
declaring
herself
his
disinterested
friend
in
the
next
uttering
wild
professions
of
attachment
she
deplored
the
sacrifice
which
had
been
made
of
her
when
quite
a
child
to
the
doting
passion
of
lord
mar
and
complained
of
his
want
of
sympathy
with
any
of
her
feelings
then
picturing
the
happiness
which
must
result
from
the
reciprocal
love
of
congenial
hearts
she
ventured
to
show
how
truly
hers
would
unite
with
wallace
the
conclusion
of
this
strange
epistle
told
him
that
the
devoted
gratitude
of
all
her
relations
of
the
house
of
cummin
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
relinquish
their
claims
on
the
crown
to
place
it
on
brows
so
worthy
to
wear
it
the
words
of
this
letter
were
so
artfully
and
so
persuasively
penned
that
had
not
edwin
described
the
inebriated
vanity
of
lady
mar
wallace
might
have
believed
that
she
was
ambitious
only
for
him
and
that
could
she
share
his
heart
his
throne
would
be
a
secondary
object
to
establish
this
deception
in
his
mind
she
added
i
live
here
as
at
the
head
of
a
court
and
fools
around
me
think
i
take
pleasure
in
it
but
did
they
look
into
my
actions
they
would
see
that
i
serve
while
i
seem
to
reign
i
am
working
in
the
hearts
of
men
for
your
advancement
but
whether
this
were
her
real
motive
or
not
it
was
the
same
to
wallace
he
felt
that
she
would
always
be
were
she
even
free
not
merely
the
last
object
in
his
thoughts
but
the
first
in
his
aversion
therefore
hastily
running
over
her
letter
he
recurred
to
a
second
perusal
of
lord
mar
in
this
he
found
satisfactory
details
of
the
success
of
his
dispositions
lord
lochawe
had
possessed
himself
of
the
western
coast
of
scotland
from
the
mull
of
kintyre
to
the
furthest
mountains
of
glenmore
there
the
victorious
lord
ruthven
had
met
him
having
completed
the
recovery
of
the
highlands
by
a
range
of
conquests
from
the
spey
to
the
murray
frith
and
lord
bothwell
also
as
his
colleague
had
brought
from
the
shore
of
ross
and
the
hills
of
caithness
every
southron
banner
which
had
disgraced
their
embattled
towers
graham
was
sent
for
by
wallace
to
hear
these
pleasant
tidings
ah
cried
edwin
in
triumph
not
a
spot
north
of
the
forth
now
remains
that
does
not
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
scottish
lion
nor
south
of
it
either
returned
graham
from
the
mull
of
galloway
to
my
gallant
father
government
on
the
tweed
from
the
cheviots
to
the
northern
ocean
all
now
is
our
own
the
door
is
locked
against
england
and
scotland
must
prove
unfaithful
to
herself
before
the
southrons
can
again
set
feet
on
her
borders
the
more
private
accounts
were
not
less
gratifying
to
wallace
for
he
found
that
his
plans
for
disciplining
and
bringing
the
people
into
order
were
everywhere
adopted
and
that
in
consequence
alarm
and
penury
had
given
way
to
peace
and
abundance
to
witness
the
success
of
his
comprehensive
designs
and
to
settle
a
dispute
between
lord
ruthven
and
the
earl
of
athol
relative
to
the
government
of
perth
lord
mar
strongly
urged
him
since
he
had
driven
the
enemy
so
many
hundred
miles
into
their
own
country
to
repair
immediately
to
the
scene
of
controversy
go
added
the
earl
through
the
lothians
and
across
the
queens
ferry
directly
into
perthshire
i
would
not
have
you
come
to
stirling
lest
it
should
be
supposed
that
you
are
influenced
in
your
judgment
either
my
myself
or
my
wife
but
i
think
there
can
not
be
a
question
that
lord
ruthven
services
to
the
great
cause
invest
him
with
a
claim
which
his
opponent
does
not
possess
lord
athol
has
none
beyond
that
of
superior
rank
but
being
the
near
relation
of
my
wife
i
believe
she
is
anxious
for
his
elevation
therefore
come
not
near
us
if
you
would
avoid
female
importunity
and
spare
me
the
pain
of
hearing
what
i
must
condemn
wallace
now
recollected
a
passage
in
lady
mar
letter
which
though
not
speaking
out
insinuated
how
she
expected
he
would
decide
she
said
as
your
interest
is
mine
my
noble
friend
all
that
belongs
to
me
is
yours
my
kindred
are
not
withheld
in
the
gift
my
devoted
heart
bestows
on
you
use
them
as
your
own
make
them
bulwarks
around
your
power
the
creatures
of
your
will
the
instruments
of
your
benevolence
the
defenders
of
your
rights
well
pleased
to
avoid
another
rencounter
with
this
lady
love
and
ambition
wallace
sent
off
the
substance
of
these
dispatches
to
murray
and
next
morning
taking
a
tender
leave
of
the
venerable
gregory
and
his
family
with
edwin
and
sir
john
graham
he
set
off
for
the
frith
of
forth
chapter
xlviii
loch
awe
it
was
on
the
eve
of
nicholas
that
the
boat
which
contained
wallace
drew
near
to
the
coast
of
fife
a
little
of
the
right
towered
the
tremendous
precipice
of
kinghorn
behold
edwin
said
he
the
cause
of
all
our
woe
from
those
horrible
cliffs
fell
the
best
of
kings
the
good
alexander
my
father
accompanied
him
in
that
fatal
ride
and
was
one
of
the
unhappy
group
who
had
the
evil
hap
to
find
his
mangled
body
among
the
rocks
below
i
have
heard
observed
graham
that
the
sage
of
ercildown
prophesied
this
dreadful
calamity
to
scotland
he
did
prognosticate
replied
wallace
that
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
a
storm
should
burst
over
this
land
which
would
lay
the
country
in
ruins
fear
seized
the
farmers
but
his
prophecy
regarded
a
nobler
object
than
their
harvests
the
day
came
rose
unclouded
and
continued
perfectly
serene
lord
march
to
whom
the
seer
had
presaged
the
event
at
noon
reproached
him
with
the
unlikeliness
of
its
completion
but
even
at
the
moment
he
was
ridiculing
the
sage
a
man
on
a
foaming
steed
arrived
at
the
gate
with
tidings
that
the
king
had
accidentally
fallen
from
the
precipice
of
kinghorn
and
was
killed
said
the
lord
of
ercildown
the
scathing
wind
and
dreadful
tempest
which
shall
long
blow
calamity
and
trouble
on
the
realm
of
scotland
and
surely
his
words
have
been
verified
for
still
the
storm
rages
around
our
borders
and
will
not
cease
i
fear
till
the
present
dragon
of
england
be
laid
as
low
as
our
noble
lion
was
by
that
mysterious
blast
iii
was
killed
in
this
manner
on
the
of
april
just
seven
years
before
the
consequent
calamities
of
his
country
made
it
necessary
for
wallace
to
rise
in
its
defense
the
like
discourse
held
the
friends
till
they
landed
at
roseyth
castle
where
they
lodged
for
the
night
and
next
morning
recommencing
their
journey
at
daybreak
they
crossed
the
lomonds
under
a
wintery
sun
and
entered
perth
in
the
midst
of
a
the
regent
arrival
soon
spread
throughout
the
province
and
the
hall
of
the
castle
was
speedily
crowded
with
chieftains
come
to
pay
their
respects
to
their
benefactor
while
an
army
of
grateful
peasantry
from
the
hills
filled
the
suburbs
of
the
town
begging
for
one
glance
only
of
their
beloved
lord
to
oblige
them
wallace
mounted
his
horse
and
between
the
lords
ruthven
and
athol
with
his
bonnet
off
rode
from
the
castle
to
the
plain
which
lay
to
the
west
of
the
city
he
gratified
their
affectionate
eagerness
by
this
condescension
and
received
in
return
the
sincere
homage
of
a
thousand
grateful
hearts
the
grampians
echoed
with
the
proud
acclamations
of
our
deliverer
our
prince
the
champion
of
scotland
the
glorious
william
wallace
and
the
shores
of
the
tay
resounded
with
similar
rejoicings
at
sight
of
him
who
made
the
scottish
seamen
lords
of
the
northern
ocean
ruthven
beheld
this
eloquence
of
nature
with
sympathetic
feelings
his
just
sense
of
the
unequaled
merits
of
the
regent
had
long
internally
acknowledged
him
as
his
sovereign
and
he
smiled
with
approbation
at
every
breathing
amongst
the
people
which
intimated
what
would
at
last
be
their
general
shout
wallace
had
proved
himself
not
only
a
warrior
but
a
legislator
in
the
midst
of
war
he
had
planted
the
fruits
of
peace
and
now
the
olive
and
the
vine
waved
abundant
on
every
hill
different
were
the
thoughts
of
the
gloomy
athol
as
he
rode
by
the
side
of
the
regent
could
he
by
a
look
have
blasted
those
valiant
arms
have
palsied
that
youthful
head
whose
judgment
shamed
the
hoariest
temples
gladly
would
he
have
made
scotland
the
sacrifice
so
that
he
might
never
again
find
himself
in
the
triumphant
train
of
one
whom
he
deemed
a
boy
and
an
upstart
thus
did
he
muse
and
thus
did
envy
open
a
way
into
his
soul
for
those
demons
to
enter
which
were
so
soon
to
possess
it
with
the
fellest
designs
the
issue
of
ruthven
claims
did
not
lessen
lord
athol
hatred
of
the
regent
wallace
simply
stated
the
case
to
him
only
changing
the
situations
of
the
opponents
he
supposed
athol
to
be
in
the
place
of
ruthven
and
then
asked
the
frowning
earl
if
ruthven
had
demanded
a
government
which
athol
had
bravely
won
and
nobly
secured
whether
he
should
deem
it
just
to
be
sentenced
to
relinquish
it
into
the
hands
of
his
rival
by
this
question
he
was
forced
to
decide
against
himself
but
while
wallace
generously
hoped
that
by
having
made
him
his
own
judge
he
had
found
an
expedient
both
to
soften
the
pain
of
disappointment
and
to
lessen
the
humiliation
of
defeat
he
had
only
redoubled
the
hatred
of
athol
who
thought
he
had
thus
been
cajoled
out
of
even
the
privilege
of
complaint
he
however
affected
to
be
reconciled
to
the
issue
of
the
affair
and
taking
a
friendly
leave
of
the
regent
retired
to
blair
and
there
amongst
the
numerous
fortresses
which
owned
his
power
amongst
the
stupendous
strongholds
of
nature
the
cloud
invested
mountains
and
the
labyrinthine
winding
of
his
lochs
and
streams
he
determined
to
pass
his
days
and
nights
in
devising
the
sure
fall
of
this
proud
usurper
for
so
the
bitterness
of
an
envy
he
durst
not
yet
breathe
to
any
impelled
him
internally
to
designate
the
unpretending
wallace
meanwhile
the
unconscious
object
of
this
hatred
oppressed
by
the
overwhelming
crowds
constantly
assembling
at
perth
to
do
him
homage
retired
to
huntingtower
a
castle
of
lord
ruthven
at
some
distance
from
the
town
secluded
from
the
throng
he
there
arranged
with
the
chiefs
of
several
clans
matters
of
consequence
to
the
internal
repose
of
the
country
but
receiving
applications
for
similar
regulations
from
the
counties
further
north
he
decided
on
going
thither
himself
severe
as
the
weather
was
at
that
season
he
bade
adieu
to
the
warm
hospitalities
of
huntingtower
and
accompanied
by
graham
and
his
young
friend
edwin
with
a
small
but
faithful
train
he
commenced
a
journey
which
he
intended
should
comprehend
the
circuit
of
the
highlands
with
the
chieftain
of
almost
every
castle
in
his
progress
he
passed
a
day
and
according
to
the
interest
which
the
situation
of
the
surrounding
peasantry
created
in
his
mind
he
lengthened
his
sojourn
everywhere
he
was
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
and
his
glad
eye
beheld
the
festivities
of
christmas
with
a
delight
which
recalled
past
emotions
till
they
wrung
his
heart
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
he
spent
with
lord
in
kichurn
castle
and
after
a
bounteous
feast
in
which
lord
and
vassal
joined
sat
up
the
night
to
hail
the
coming
in
of
the
new
season
wallace
had
passed
that
hour
twelve
months
ago
alone
with
his
marion
they
sat
together
in
the
window
of
the
eastern
tower
of
ellerslie
and
while
he
listened
to
the
cheerful
lilts
to
which
their
servants
were
dancing
the
hand
of
his
lovely
bride
was
clasped
in
his
marion
smiled
and
talked
of
the
happiness
which
should
await
them
in
the
year
to
come
ay
my
beloved
answered
he
more
than
thy
beauteous
self
will
then
fill
these
happy
arms
thy
babe
my
wife
will
then
hand
at
thy
bosom
to
bless
with
a
parent
joys
thy
grateful
husband
that
time
was
now
come
round
and
where
was
marion
in
the
grave
where
that
smiling
babe
murderer
steel
had
reached
it
ere
it
saw
the
light
wallace
groaned
at
these
recollections
he
struck
his
hand
forcibly
on
his
bursting
heart
and
fled
from
the
room
the
noise
of
the
harps
the
laughing
of
the
dancers
prevented
his
emotions
from
being
observed
and
rushing
far
from
the
joyous
tumult
till
its
sounds
died
in
the
breeze
or
were
only
brought
to
his
ear
by
fitful
gusts
he
speeded
along
the
margin
of
the
lake
as
if
he
would
have
flown
even
from
himself
but
memory
racking
memory
followed
him
throwing
himself
on
a
bank
over
which
the
ice
hung
in
pointed
masses
he
felt
not
the
roughness
of
the
ground
for
all
within
him
was
disturbed
and
at
war
why
cried
he
o
why
was
i
selected
for
this
cruel
sacrifice
why
was
this
heart
to
whom
the
acclaim
of
multitudes
could
bring
no
selfish
joy
why
was
it
to
be
bereft
of
all
that
ever
made
it
beat
with
transport
companion
of
my
days
partner
of
my
soul
my
lost
lost
marion
and
are
thine
eyes
forever
closed
on
me
shall
i
never
more
clasp
that
hand
which
ever
thrilled
my
frame
with
every
sense
of
rapture
gone
gone
forever
and
i
am
alone
long
and
agonizing
was
the
pause
which
succeeded
to
this
fearful
tempest
of
feeling
in
that
hour
of
grief
renewed
in
all
its
former
violence
he
forgot
country
friends
and
all
on
earth
the
recollection
of
his
fame
was
mockery
to
him
for
where
was
she
to
whom
the
sound
of
his
praises
would
have
given
so
much
joy
ah
said
he
it
was
indeed
happiness
to
be
brightened
in
those
eyes
when
the
gratitude
of
our
poor
retainers
met
thine
ear
how
didst
thou
lay
thy
soft
cheek
to
mine
and
shoot
its
gentle
warmth
into
my
heart
at
that
moment
he
turned
his
face
on
the
gelid
bank
starting
with
wild
horror
he
exclaimed
is
it
now
so
cold
my
marion
my
murdered
wife
and
rushing
from
the
spot
he
again
hastened
along
the
margin
of
the
loch
but
there
he
still
heard
the
distant
sound
of
the
pipes
from
the
castle
he
could
not
bear
their
gay
notes
and
darting
up
the
hill
which
overhung
domain
he
ascended
with
swift
and
reckless
steps
the
rocky
sides
of
ben
cruachan
full
of
distracting
thoughts
and
impelled
by
a
wild
despair
he
hurried
from
steep
to
steep
and
was
rapidly
descending
the
western
side
of
the
mountain
regardless
of
the
piercing
sleet
when
his
course
was
suddenly
checked
by
coming
with
a
violent
shock
against
another
human
being
who
running
as
hastily
through
the
storm
had
driven
impetuously
against
wallace
but
being
the
weaker
of
the
two
was
struck
to
the
ground
the
accident
rallied
the
scattered
senses
of
the
chief
he
now
felt
that
he
was
out
in
the
midst
of
a
furious
winter
tempest
had
wandered
he
knew
not
whither
and
probably
had
materially
injured
some
poor
traveler
by
his
intemperate
motion
he
raised
the
fallen
man
and
asked
whether
he
were
hurt
the
traveler
perceiving
by
the
kind
tone
of
the
inquirer
that
no
harm
had
been
intended
answered
not
much
only
a
little
lamed
and
all
the
recompense
i
ask
for
this
unlucky
upset
is
to
give
me
a
helping
hand
to
my
father
cot
it
is
just
by
i
have
been
out
at
a
neighbor
to
dance
in
the
new
year
with
a
bonny
lass
who
however
may
not
thank
you
for
my
broken
shins
as
the
honest
lad
went
on
telling
his
tale
with
a
great
many
particulars
dear
to
his
simple
wishes
wallace
helped
him
along
and
carefully
conducting
him
through
the
gathering
snow
descended
the
declivity
which
led
to
the
shepherd
cottage
when
within
a
few
yards
of
it
wallace
heard
the
sound
of
singing
but
it
was
not
the
gay
caroling
of
mirth
the
solemn
chant
of
more
serious
music
mingled
with
the
roaring
blast
i
am
not
too
late
yet
cried
the
communicative
lad
i
should
not
have
run
so
fast
had
i
not
wanted
to
get
home
in
time
enough
to
make
one
in
the
hymn
they
had
now
arrived
at
the
little
door
and
the
youth
without
the
ceremony
of
knocking
opened
the
latch
as
he
did
so
he
turned
and
said
to
his
companion
we
have
no
occasion
for
bolts
since
the
brave
lord
wallace
has
cleared
the
country
of
our
southron
robbers
he
pushed
the
door
as
he
spoke
and
displayed
to
the
eyes
of
the
chief
a
venerable
old
man
on
his
knees
before
a
crucifix
around
him
knelt
a
family
of
young
people
and
an
aged
dame
all
joining
in
the
sacred
thanksgiving
the
youth
without
a
word
dropped
on
his
knees
near
the
door
and
making
a
sign
to
his
companion
to
do
the
same
wallace
obeyed
and
as
the
anthems
rose
in
succession
on
the
ear
to
which
the
low
breathings
of
the
lightly
touched
harp
echoed
its
heavenly
strains
he
felt
the
tumult
of
his
bosom
gradually
subside
and
when
the
venerable
sire
laid
down
the
instrument
and
clasped
his
hands
in
prayer
the
natural
pathos
of
his
invocations
and
the
grateful
devotions
with
which
the
young
people
gave
their
response
all
tended
to
tranquilize
his
mind
into
a
holy
calm
at
the
termination
of
the
concluding
prayer
how
sweet
were
the
emotions
of
wallace
when
he
heard
these
words
uttered
with
augmented
fervor
by
the
aged
petitioner
while
we
thus
thank
thee
o
gracious
god
for
the
mercies
bestowed
upon
us
we
humbly
implore
thee
to
hold
in
thine
almighty
protection
him
by
whose
arm
thou
has
wrought
the
deliverance
of
scotland
let
our
preserver
be
saved
from
his
sins
by
the
blood
of
christ
let
our
benefactor
be
blessed
in
mind
body
and
estate
and
all
prosper
with
him
that
he
takes
in
hand
may
the
good
he
has
dispensed
to
his
country
be
returned
into
his
bosom
and
may
he
live
to
see
a
race
of
his
own
reaping
the
harvest
of
his
virtues
and
adding
fresh
honors
to
the
stalwart
name
of
wallace
every
mouth
echoed
a
fervent
amen
to
this
prayer
and
wallace
himself
inwardly
breathed
and
have
i
not
even
now
sinned
god
in
the
distraction
of
this
night
remembrance
i
mourned
i
would
not
be
comforted
but
in
thy
mercy
thou
hast
led
me
hither
to
see
the
happy
fruits
of
my
labors
and
i
am
resigned
and
thankful
the
sacred
rites
over
two
girls
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
between
them
brought
forward
a
rough
table
covered
with
dishes
and
bread
while
the
mother
taking
off
a
large
pot
emptied
its
smoking
contents
into
the
different
vessels
meanwhile
the
young
man
introducing
the
stranger
to
his
father
related
the
accident
of
the
meeting
and
the
good
old
shepherd
bidding
him
a
hearty
welcome
desired
him
to
draw
near
the
fire
and
partake
of
their
breakfast
we
need
the
fire
i
assure
you
cried
the
lad
for
we
are
dripping
wallace
now
advanced
from
the
shadowed
part
of
the
room
where
he
had
knelt
and
drawing
toward
the
light
certainly
displayed
to
his
host
the
truth
of
his
son
observation
he
had
left
the
castle
without
his
bonnet
and
hurrying
on
regardless
of
the
whelming
storm
his
hair
became
saturated
with
wet
and
now
streamed
in
water
over
his
shoulders
the
good
old
wife
seeing
the
stranger
situation
was
worse
than
her
son
snatched
away
the
bottle
out
of
which
he
was
swallowing
a
heavy
cordial
and
poured
it
over
the
exposed
head
of
her
guest
then
ordering
one
of
her
daughters
to
rub
it
dry
she
took
off
his
plaid
and
wringing
it
hung
it
to
the
fire
during
these
various
operations
for
the
whole
family
seemed
eager
to
show
their
hospitality
the
old
man
discovered
not
so
much
by
the
costliness
of
his
garments
as
by
the
noble
mien
and
gentle
manners
of
the
stranger
that
he
was
some
chieftain
from
the
castle
your
honor
said
he
must
pardon
the
uncourtliness
of
our
ways
but
we
give
you
the
best
we
have
and
the
worthy
lord
can
not
do
more
wallace
gave
smiling
answers
to
all
their
remarks
and
offers
of
service
he
partook
of
their
broth
praised
the
good
wife
cakes
and
sat
discoursing
with
the
family
with
all
the
gayety
and
frankness
of
one
of
themselves
his
unreserved
manners
opened
every
heart
around
him
and
with
confidential
freedom
the
venerable
shepherd
related
his
domestic
history
dwelling
particularly
on
the
projected
marriages
of
his
children
which
he
said
should
now
take
place
since
the
good
sir
william
wallace
had
brought
peace
to
the
land
wallace
gratified
the
worthy
father
he
appearing
to
take
an
interest
in
all
his
narratives
and
then
allowing
the
happy
spirits
of
the
young
people
to
break
in
upon
these
graver
discussions
he
smiled
with
them
or
looked
serious
with
the
garrulous
matron
who
turned
the
discourse
to
tales
of
other
times
he
listened
with
complacency
to
every
legend
of
witch
fairy
and
ghost
and
his
enlightened
remarks
sometimes
pointed
out
natural
causes
for
the
extraordinary
appearances
she
described
or
at
better
attested
and
less
equivocal
accounts
of
supernatural
apparitions
he
acknowledged
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
philosophy
morning
dawned
before
the
tranquilized
nay
happy
wallace
happy
in
the
cheerful
innocence
of
the
scene
discovered
that
the
night
was
past
as
the
gray
light
gleamed
through
the
wooden
shutters
he
arose
my
friends
i
must
leave
you
said
he
there
are
those
not
far
off
who
may
be
alarmed
at
my
disappearance
for
none
knew
when
i
walked
abroad
and
unwittingly
i
have
been
charmed
all
these
hours
to
remain
enjoying
the
happiness
of
your
circle
forgetful
of
the
anxiety
i
have
perhaps
occasioned
in
my
own
the
old
man
declared
his
intention
of
seeing
him
over
the
hill
wallace
declined
giving
him
that
trouble
saying
that
as
it
was
daylight
and
the
snow
had
ceased
he
could
easily
retrace
his
steps
to
the
castle
no
no
returned
the
shepherd
and
besides
said
he
as
i
hear
the
good
lord
regent
is
keeping
the
new
year
with
our
noble
earl
who
knows
but
i
may
get
a
glimpse
of
his
noble
countenance
and
that
will
be
a
sight
to
tell
of
till
i
die
god
blessing
on
his
sweet
face
cried
the
old
woman
but
i
would
give
all
the
yarn
in
my
muckle
chest
to
catch
one
look
of
his
lucky
eye
i
warrant
you
witch
nor
fairy
could
never
harm
me
more
ah
father
cried
the
eldest
of
the
girls
blushing
if
you
go
near
enough
to
him
do
you
know
madgie
grant
told
me
if
i
could
but
get
even
the
least
bit
of
sir
william
wallace
hair
and
give
it
to
donal
cameron
to
wear
in
a
true
lover
know
on
his
breast
no
southron
will
be
able
to
do
him
harm
as
long
as
he
lives
and
do
you
believe
it
would
protect
your
lover
my
pretty
jeannie
inquired
wallace
with
a
sweet
smile
surely
she
replied
for
madgie
is
a
wise
woman
and
has
the
second
sight
well
then
returned
he
you
shall
be
gratified
for
though
i
must
for
once
contradict
the
testimony
of
a
wise
woman
and
tell
you
that
nothing
can
render
a
man
absolutely
safe
but
the
protection
of
heaven
yet
if
a
hair
from
the
head
of
sir
william
wallace
would
please
you
and
a
glance
from
his
eye
gratify
your
mother
both
shall
be
satisfied
and
lifting
up
the
old
woman
shears
which
lay
on
a
before
him
he
cut
off
a
golden
lock
from
the
middle
of
his
head
and
put
it
into
the
hand
of
jeannie
at
this
action
which
was
performed
with
such
noble
grace
that
not
one
of
the
family
now
doubted
who
had
been
their
guest
the
good
dame
fell
on
her
knees
and
jeannie
with
a
cry
of
joy
putting
the
beautiful
lock
into
her
bosom
followed
the
example
and
in
a
woman
all
were
clinging
around
him
the
old
man
grasped
his
hand
bravest
of
men
cried
he
the
lord
has
indeed
blessed
this
house
since
he
has
honored
it
with
the
presence
of
the
deliverer
of
scotland
my
prayers
and
the
benedictions
of
all
good
men
friend
or
foe
must
ever
follow
your
footsteps
tears
of
pleasure
started
into
the
eyes
of
wallace
he
raised
the
family
one
by
one
from
the
ground
and
putting
his
purse
into
the
hand
of
the
dame
there
my
kind
hostess
said
he
let
that
fill
the
chests
of
your
daughters
on
their
bridal
day
they
must
receive
it
as
a
brother
portion
to
his
sisters
for
it
is
with
fraternal
affection
that
william
wallace
regards
the
sons
and
daughters
of
scotland
the
happy
sobs
of
the
old
woman
stopped
the
expressions
of
her
gratitude
but
her
son
fearing
his
freedom
of
the
night
before
might
have
offended
stood
abashed
at
a
distance
wallace
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
my
good
archibald
cried
he
do
not
hold
back
from
one
who
will
always
be
your
friend
i
shall
send
from
the
castle
this
day
sufficient
to
fill
your
bridal
coffers
also
archibald
now
petitioned
to
be
allowed
to
follow
him
in
his
army
no
my
brave
youth
replied
the
chief
lord
lochawe
will
lead
you
forth
whenever
there
is
occasion
and
meanwhile
your
duty
is
to
imitate
the
domestic
duties
of
your
worthy
father
make
the
neighboring
valley
smile
with
the
fruits
of
your
industry
and
raise
a
family
to
bless
you
as
you
now
bless
him
wallace
having
wrapped
himself
in
his
plaid
now
withdrew
amidst
the
benedictions
of
the
whole
group
and
swiftly
recrossing
the
mountain
heights
was
soon
on
the
western
brow
of
ben
cruachan
in
ten
minutes
afterward
he
entered
the
hall
of
kilchurn
castle
a
few
servants
only
were
astir
the
rest
of
the
family
were
still
asleep
about
an
hour
after
their
friend
departure
the
earl
and
graham
had
missed
him
but
supposing
that
whithersoever
he
was
gone
he
would
soon
return
they
made
no
inquiries
and
when
the
tempest
began
on
edwin
expressing
his
anxiety
to
know
where
he
was
one
of
the
servants
said
he
was
gone
to
his
chamber
this
answer
satisfied
every
one
and
they
continued
to
enjoy
the
festal
scene
until
the
countess
of
made
the
signal
for
repose
next
morning
when
the
family
met
at
the
they
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
wallace
recount
the
adventure
of
the
night
and
while
promised
every
kindness
to
the
shepherd
and
a
messenger
was
dispatched
with
a
purse
to
archibald
edwin
learned
from
the
earl
servant
that
his
reason
for
supposing
the
regent
was
gone
to
his
room
arose
from
the
sight
of
his
bonnet
in
the
outer
hall
wallace
was
glad
that
such
an
evidence
had
prevented
his
friends
being
alarmed
and
retiring
with
lord
with
his
usual
equanimity
of
mind
resumed
the
graver
errand
of
his
tour
the
hospitable
rites
of
the
season
being
over
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
earl
accompanied
his
illustrious
guest
to
make
the
circuit
of
argyleshire
at
castle
urguhart
they
parted
and
wallace
proceeding
with
his
two
friends
performed
his
legislative
visits
from
sea
to
sea
having
traversed
with
perfect
satisfaction
the
whole
of
the
northern
part
of
the
kingdom
he
returned
to
huntingtower
on
the
very
morning
that
a
messenger
had
reached
it
from
murray
that
vigilant
chieftain
informed
the
regent
of
king
edward

from
flanders
and
that
he
was
preparing
a
large
army
to
march
into

must
meet
him
cried
wallace
on
his
own
shores
and
so
let

horrors

of

full
on
the
country
whose
king
would
bring

chapter
xlix
stanmore
the
gathering
word
was
dispatched
from
chief
to
chief
to
call
the
clans
of
the
highlands
to
meet
their
regent
by
a
certain
day
in
clydesdale
wallace
himself
set
forward
to
summon
the
strength
of
the
lowlands
but
at
kinclavin
castle
on
the
coast
of
fife
he
was
surprised
with
another
embassy
from
edward
a
herald
accompanied
by
that
sir
hugh
le
de
spencer
who
had
conducted
himself
so
insolently
on
his
first
embrassage
on
his
entering
the
chamber
where
the
regent
sat
with
the
chiefs
who
had
accompanied
him
from
perthsire
the
two
english
men
walked
forward
but
before
the
herald
could
pay
the
customary
respects
le
de
spencer
advanced
to
wallace
and
to
the
price
of
a
little
mind
elated
at
being
empowered
to
insult
with
impunity
he
broke
forth
sir
william
wallace
the
contumely
with
which
the
embassadors
of
prince
edward
were
treated
is
so
resented
by
the
king
of
england
that
he
invests
his
own
majesty
in
my
person
to
tell
you
that
your
treasons
have
filled
up
their
measure
that
now
in
the
plenitude
of
his
continental
victories
he
descends
upon
scotland
to
annihilate
this
rebellious
nation
stop
sir
hugh
le
de
spencer
cried
the
herald
touching
him
with
his
scepter
whatever
may
be
the
denunciations
with
which
our
sovereign
has
intrusted
you
you
must
allow
me
to
perform
my
duty
before
you
declare
them
and
thus
i
utter
the
gracious
message
with
which
his
majesty
has
honored
my
mouth
he
then
addressed
wallace
and
in
the
king
name
accusing
him
of
rebellion
and
of
unfair
and
cruel
devastations
made
in
scotland
and
in
england
promised
him
pardon
for
all
if
he
would
immediately
disband
his
followers
and
acknowledge
his
offense
wallace
motioned
with
his
hand
for
his
friends
to
keep
silence
for
he
perceived
that
two
or
three
of
the
most
violent
were
ready
to
break
forth
in
fierce
defiance
of
king
edward
and
being
obeyed
he
calmly
replied
to
the
herald
when
we
were
desolate
your
king
came
to
us
as
a
comforter
and
he
put
us
in
chains
while
he
was
absent
i
invaded
his
country
as
an
open
enemy
i
rifled
your
barns
but
it
was
to
feed
a
people
whom
his
robberies
had
left
to
perish
i
marched
through
your
lands
i
made
your
soldiers
fly
before
me
but
what
spot
in
all
your
shores
have
i
made
black
with
the
smoke
of
ruin
i
leave
the
people
of
northumberland
to
judge
between
me
and
your
monarch
and
that
he
never
shall
be
mine
or
scotland
with
god
blessing
on
the
right
our
deeds
shall
further
prove
vain
and
ruinous
determination
exclaimed
le
de
spencer
king
edward
comes
against
you
with
an
army
that
will
reach
from
sea
to
sea
wherever
the
hoofs
of
his
strike
there
grass
never
grows
again
the
sword
and
the
fire
shall
make
a
desert
of
this
devoted
land
and
your
arrogant
head
proud
scot
shall
bleed
upon
the
scaffold
he
shall
first
see
my
fires
and
meet
my
sword
in
his
own
fields
returned
wallace
and
if
god
continues
my
life
i
will
keep
my
easter
in
england
in
despite
of
king
edward
and
of
all
who
bear
armor
in
his
country
as
he
spoke
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
bowing
his
head
to
the
herald
the
scottish
marshals
conducted
the
embassadors
from
his
presence
le
de
spencer
twice
attempted
to
speak
but
the
marshals
would
not
allow
him
they
said
that
the
business
of
the
embassy
was
now
over
and
should
he
presume
further
to
insult
their
regent
the
privilege
of
his
official
character
should
not
protect
him
from
the
wrath
of
the
scots
intimidated
by
the
frowning
brows
and
nervous
arms
of
all
around
he
held
his
peace
and
the
doors
were
shut
on
him
wallace
foresaw
the
heavy
tempest
to
scotland
threatened
by
these
repeated
embassies
he
perceived
that
edward
by
sending
overtures
which
he
knew
could
not
be
accepted
by
making
a
show
of
pacific
intentions
meant
to
throw
the
blame
of
the
continuation
of
hostilities
upon
the
scots
and
so
overcome
the
reluctance
of
his
more
equitable
nobility
to
further
persecute
a
people
whom
he
had
made
suffer
so
unjustly
the
same
insidious
policy
was
likewise
meant
to
change
the
aspect
of
the
scottish
cause
in
the
eyes
of
philip
of
france
who
had
lately
sent
congratulations
to
the
regent
on
the
victory
of
and
by
that
means
deprive
him
of
a
powerful
ally
and
zealous
negotiator
for
an
honorable
peace
to
prevent
this
last
injury
wallace
dispatched
a
vessel
with
sir
alexander
ramsay
to
inform
king
philip
of
the
particulars
of
edward
proposals
and
of
the
consequent
continued
warfare
on
the
of
february
sir
william
wallace
joined
lord
andrew
murray
on
bothwell
moor
where
he
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
his
brave
friend
again
lord
of
the
domains
he
had
so
lately
lost
in
the
scottish
cause
wallace
did
not
visit
the
castle
at
such
a
crisis
he
forbore
to
unnerve
his
mind
by
awakening
the
griefs
which
lay
slumbering
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
halbert
came
from
his
convent
once
more
to
look
upon
the
face
of
his
beloved
master
the
meeting
cost
wallace
many
agonizing
pangs
but
he
smiled
on
his
faithful
servant
he
pressed
the
venerable
form
in
his
manly
arms
and
promised
him
news
of
his
life
and
safety
may
i
die
cried
the
old
man
ere
i
hear
it
is
otherwise
but
youth
is
no
warrant
for
life
the
vigor
of
those
arms
can
not
always
assure
themselves
of
victory
and
should
you
fall
where
would
be
our
country
with
a
better
than
i
returned
the
chief
in
the
arms
of
god
he
will
fight
for
scotland
when
wallace
is
laid
low
halbert
wept
but
the
trumpet
sounded
for
the
field
he
blessed
his
lord
and
they
parted
forever
a
strong
force
from
the
highlands
joined
the
troops
from
stirling
and
wallace
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
before
him
thirty
thousand
men
eager
for
the
fight
with
all
scotland
pressing
on
his
heart
his
eye
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
distant
towers
of
bothwell
but
not
delaying
a
moment
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
legions
and
set
forth
through
a
country
now
budding
with
all
the
charms
of
the
cultivation
he
had
spread
over
it
in
the
midst
of
a
fine
glen
of
renovated
corn
fields
he
was
met
by
a
courier
from
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
with
information
that
the
northumbrians
being
apprised
of
king
edward
approach
were
assembling
in
immense
bodies
and
having
crossed
the
debatable
land
in
the
night
had
driven
sir
eustace
maxwell
with
great
loss
into
carlaveroch
and
though
harassed
by
kirkpatrick
himself
were
ravaging
the
country
as
far
as
dumfries
the
letter
of
the
brave
knight
added
these
southron
thieves
blow
the
name
of
edward
before
them
and
with
its
sound
have
the
courage
of
every
soul
i
meet
come
then
valiant
wallace
and
conjure
it
down
again
else
i
shall
not
be
surprised
if
the
men
of
annandale
bind
me
hand
and
foot
and
deliver
me
up
to
algernon
percy
the
leader
of
this
inroad
to
purchase
mercy
to
their
cowardice
wallace
made
no
reply
to
this
message
and
proclaiming
to
his
men
that
the
enemy
were
in
dumfriesshire
every
foot
was
put
to
the
speed
and
in
a
short
time
they
arrived
on
the
ridgy
summits
of
the
eastern
mountains
of
clydesdale
his
troops
halted
for
rest
near
the
village
of
biggar
and
it
being
night
he
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
highest
craig
and
lighted
a
fire
whose
light
he
hoped
would
send
the
news
of
his
approach
to
annandale
the
air
being
calm
and
clear
the
signal
rose
in
such
a
long
pyramid
of
flame
that
distant
shouts
of
rejoicing
were
heard
breaking
the
deep
silence
of
the
hour
a
moment
after
a
hundred
answering
beacons
burned
along
the
horizon
torthorald
saw
the
propitious
blaze
he
showed
it
to
his
terrified
followers
behold
that
hill
of
fire
cried
he
and
cease
to
despair
wallace
comes
was
their
response
and
we
will
do
or
die
mountain
from
which
this
beacon
sent
its
rays
has
from
that
hour
been
called
tinto
or
tintoc
which
signifies
the
hill
of
fire
and
is
yet
regarded
by
the
country
people
with
a
devotion
almost
idolatrous
its
height
is
about
feet
from
the
sea
day
broke
upon
wallace
as
he
crossed
the
heights
of
drumlaurig
and
pouring
his
thousands
over
the
almost
deserted
valleys
of
annandale
like
a
torrent
he
swept
the
invaders
back
upon
their
steps
he
took
young
percy
prisoner
and
leaving
him
shut
up
in
lochmaben
drove
his
flying
vassals
far
beyond
the
borders
annandale
again
free
he
went
into
its
various
quarters
and
summoning
the
people
who
now
crept
from
their
caves
and
woods
to
shelter
under
his
shield
he
reproved
them
for
their
cowardice
and
showed
them
that
unless
every
man
possesses
a
courage
equal
to
his
general
he
must
expect
to
fall
under
the
yoke
of
the
enemy
faith
in
a
leader
is
good
said
he
but
not
such
a
faith
as
leaves
him
to
act
without
yourselves
rendering
that
assistance
to
your
own
preservation
which
heaven
itself
commands
when
absent
from
you
in
person
i
left
my
spirit
with
you
in
the
brave
knights
of
carlaveroch
and
torthorald
and
yet
you
fled
had
i
been
here
and
you
done
the
same
the
like
must
have
been
the
consequence
what
think
you
is
in
my
arm
that
i
should
alone
stem
your
enemies
the
expectation
is
extravagant
and
false
i
am
but
the
head
of
the
battle
you
are
the
aims
if
you
shrink
i
fall
and
the
cause
is
ruined
you
follow
my
call
to
the
field
you
fight
valiantly
and
i
win
the
day
respect
then
yourselves
and
believe
that
you
are
the
sinews
the
nerves
the
strength
of
sir
william
wallace
some
looked
manfully
up
at
this
exhortation
but
most
hung
their
heads
in
remembered
shame
while
he
continued
dishonor
not
your
fathers
and
your
trust
in
god
by
relying
on
any
one
human
arm
or
doubting
that
from
heaven
be
confident
that
while
the
standard
of
true
liberty
is
before
you
you
fight
under
god
banner
see
how
i
in
that
faith
drove
these
conquering
northumbrians
before
me
like
frighted
roes
you
might
and
must
do
the
same
or
the
sword
of
wallace
is
drawn
in
vain
partake
my
spirit
brethren
of
annandale
fight
as
stoutly
over
my
grave
as
by
my
side
or
before
the
year
expires
you
will
again
be
the
slaves
of
edward
such
language
while
it
covered
the
fugitives
with
confusion
of
face
awoke
emulation
in
all
to
efface
with
honorable
deeds
the
memory
of
their
disgrace
with
augmented
forces
he
therefore
marched
into
cumberland
and
having
drawn
up
his
array
between
a
river
and
a
high
ground
which
he
covered
with
archers
he
stood
prepared
to
meet
the
approach
of
king
edward
but
edward
did
not
appear
till
late
in
the
next
day
and
then
the
scots
descried
his
legions
advancing
from
the
horizon
to
pitch
their
vanguard
on
the
plain
of
stanmore
wallace
knew
that
for
the
first
time
he
was
now
going
to
pit
his
soldiership
against
that
of
the
greatest
general
in
christendom
but
he
did
not
shrink
from
measuring
him
arm
to
arm
and
mind
to
mind
for
the
assurance
of
his
cause
was
in
both
his
present
aim
was
to
draw
the
english
toward
the
scottish
lines
where
at
certain
distances
he
had
dug
deep
pits
and
having
covered
them
lightly
with
twigs
and
loose
grass
left
them
as
traps
for
the
southron
cavalry
for
in
cavalry
he
was
told
by
his
spies
would
consist
the
chief
strength
of
edward
army
the
waste
in
which
wallace
had
laid
the
adjoining
counties
rendered
the
provisioning
of
so
large
a
host
difficult
and
besides
as
it
was
composed
of
a
mixed
multitude
from
every
land
on
which
the
king
of
england
had
set
his
invading
foot
harmony
could
not
be
expected
to
continue
amongst
its
leaders
delay
was
therefore
an
advantage
to
the
scottish
regent
and
observing
that
his
enemy
held
back
as
if
he
wished
to
draw
him
from
his
position
he
determined
not
to
stir
although
he
might
seem
to
be
struck
with
awe
of
so
great
an
adversary
to
this
end
he
offered
him
peace
hoping
either
to
obtain
what
he
asked
which
he
did
not
deem
probable
or
by
filling
edward
with
an
idea
of
his
fear
urge
him
to
precipitate
himself
forward
to
avoid
the
danger
of
a
prolonged
sojourn
in
so
barren
a
country
and
to
take
wallace
as
he
might
think
in
his
panic
instructing
his
heralds
what
to
say
he
sent
them
on
to
roycross
near
which
the
tent
of
the
king
of
england
was
pitched
supposing
that
his
enemy
was
now
at
his
feet
and
ready
to
beg
the
terms
he
had
before
objected
edward
admitted
the
embassadors
and
bade
them
deliver
their
message
without
further
parley
the
herald
spoke
thus
saith
sir
william
wallace
were
it
not
that
the
kings
and
nobles
of
the
realm
of
scotland
have
ever
asked
redress
of
injuries
before
they
sought
revenge
you
king
of
england
and
invader
of
our
country
should
not
now
behold
orators
in
your
camp
persuading
concord
but
an
army
in
battle
array
advancing
to
the
onset
our
lord
regent
being
of
the
ancient
opinion
of
his
renowned
predecessors
that
the
greatest
victories
are
never
of
such
advantage
to
a
conqueror
as
an
honorable
and
bloodless
peace
sends
to
offer
this
peace
to
you
at
the
price
of
restitution
the
lives
you
have
rifled
from
us
you
can
not
restore
but
the
noble
lord
douglas
whom
you
now
unjustly
detain
a
prisoner
we
demand
and
that
you
retract
those
claims
on
our
monarchy
which
never
had
existence
till
ambition
begot
them
on
the
basest
treachery
grant
these
just
requisitions
and
we
lay
down
our
arms
but
continue
to
deny
them
and
our
nations
is
ready
to
rise
to
a
man
and
with
heart
and
hand
avenge
the
injuries
we
have
sustained
you
have
wasted
our
lands
burned
our
towns
and
imprisoned
our
nobility
without
consideration
of
age
or
condition
women
children
and
feeble
old
men
have
unresisting
fallen
by
your
sword
and
why
was
all
this
did
our
confidence
in
your
honor
offend
you
that
you
put
our
chieftains
in
durance
and
deprived
our
yeomanry
of
their
lives
did
the
benedictions
with
which
our
prelates
hailed
you
as
the
arbitrator
between
our
princes
raise
your
ire
that
you
burned
their
churches
and
slew
them
on
the
altars
these
o
king
were
thy
deeds
and
for
these
william
wallace
is
in
arms
but
yield
us
the
peace
we
ask
withdraw
from
our
quarters
relinquish
your
unjust
pretensions
and
we
shall
once
more
consider
edward
of
england
as
the
kinsman
of
alexander
the
third
and
his
subjects
the
friends
and
allies
of
our
realm
not
in
the
least
moved
by
this
address
edward
contemptuously
answered
intoxicated
by
a
transitory
success
your
leader
is
vain
enough
to
suppose
that
he
can
discomfort
the
king
of
england
as
he
has
done
his
unworthy
officers
by
fierce
and
insolent
words
but
we
are
not
so
weak
as
to
be
overthrown
by
a
breath
nor
so
base
as
to
bear
argument
from
a
rebel
i
come
to
claim
my
own
to
assert
my
supremacy
over
scotland
and
it
shall
acknowledge
its
liege
lord
or
be
left
a
desert
without
a
living
creature
to
say
was
a
kingdom
depart
this
is
my
answer
to
you
your
leader
shall
receive
his
at
the
point
of
my
lance
wallace
who
did
not
expect
a
more
favorable
reply
ere
his
embassadors
returned
had
marshaled
his
lines
for
the
onset
lord
bothwell
with
murray
his
valiant
son
took
the
lead
on
the
left
wing
sir
eustace
maxwell
and
kirkpatrick
commanded
on
the
right
graham
in
whose
quick
observation
and
promptitude
to
bring
it
to
effect
wallace
placed
the
first
confidence
held
the
reserve
behind
the
woods
and
the
regent
himself
with
edwin
and
his
brave
occupied
the
center
having
heard
the
report
of
his
messengers
he
repeated
to
his
troops
the
lines
he
exhorted
them
to
remember
that
on
that
day
the
eyes
of
all
scotland
would
be
upon
them
they
were
the
first
of
their
country
who
had
gone
forth
to
meet
the
tyrant
in
a
pitched
battle
and
in
proportion
to
the
danger
they
confronted
would
be
their
meed
of
glory
but
it
is
not
for
renown
merely
that
you
are
called
upon
to
fight
this
day
said
he
your
rights
your
homes
are
at
stake
you
have
no
hope
of
security
for
your
lives
but
in
an
unswerving
determination
to
keep
the
field
and
let
the
world
see
how
much
more
might
lies
in

and

trust
him
who
blesses

your

though
affecting
to
despise
his
young
opponent
edward
was
too
good
a
general
really
to
condemn
an
enemy
who
had
so
often
proved
himself
worthy
of
respect
and
therefore
by
declaring
his
determination
to
put
all
the
scottish
chieftains
to
death
and
to
transfer
their
estates
to
his
conquering
officers
he
stimulated
their
avarice
as
well
as
love
of
fame
and
with
every
passion
in
arms
they
pushed
to
the
combat
wallace
stood
unmoved
not
a
bow
was
drawn
till
the
impetuous
squadrons
in
full
charge
toward
the
flanks
of
the
scots
fell
into
the
pits
then
it
was
that
the
highland
archers
on
the
hill
launched
their
arrows
the
plunging
horses
were
instantly
overwhelmed
by
others
who
could
not
be
checked
in
their
career
new
showers
of
darts
rained
upon
them
and
sticking
into
their
flesh
made
them
rear
and
roll
upon
their
riders
while
others
who
were
wounded
but
had
escaped
the
pits
flew
back
in
rage
of
pain
upon
the
advancing
infantry
a
confusion
ensued
so
perilous
that
the
king
thought
it
necessary
to
precipitate
himself
forward
and
in
person
attack
the
main
body
of
his
adversary
which
yet
stood
inactive
giving
the
spur
to
his
charger
he
ordered
his
troops
to
press
on
over
the
struggling
heaps
before
them
and
being
obeyed
with
much
difficulty
and
great
loss
he
passed
the
first
range
of
pits
but
a
second
and
wider
awaited
him
and
there
seeing
his
men
sink
into
them
by
squadrons
he
beheld
the
whole
army
of
wallace
close
in
upon
them
terrific
was
now
the
havoc
the
very
numbers
of
the
southrons
and
the
mixed
discipline
of
their
army
proved
its
bane
in
the
tumult
they
hardly
understood
the
orders
which
were
given
and
some
mistaking
them
acted
so
contrary
to
the
intended
movements
that
edward
galloping
from
one
end
of
the
field
to
the
other
appeared
like
a
frantic
man
regardless
of
every
personal
danger
so
that
he
could
but
fix
others
to
front
the
same
tempest
of
death
with
himself
his
officers
trembled
at
every
step
he
took
for
fear
that
some
of
the
secret
pits
should
ingulf
him
however
the
unshrinking
courage
of
their
monarch
rallied
a
part
of
the
distracted
army
which
with
all
the
force
of
desperation
he
drove
against
the
center
of
the
scots
but
at
this
juncture
the
reserve
under
graham
having
turned
the
royal
position
charged
him
in
the
rear
and
the
archers
redoubling
their
discharge
of
artillery
the
flanderkins
who
were
in
the
van
of
edward
suddenly
giving
way
with
cries
of
terror
the
amazed
king
found
himself
obliged
to
retreat
or
run
the
risk
of
being
taken
he
gave
a
signal
the
first
of
the
kind
he
had
ever
sounded
in
his
drawing
his
english
troops
around
him
after
much
hard
fighting
fell
back
in
tolerable
order
beyond
the
confines
of
his
camp
the
scots
were
eager
to
pursue
him
but
wallace
checked
the
motion
let
us
not
hunt
the
lion
till
he
stand
at
bay
cried
he
he
will
retire
far
enough
from
the
scottish
borders
without
our
leaving
this
vantage
ground
to
drive
him
what
wallace
said
came
to
pass
soon
no
vestige
of
a
southron
soldier
but
the
dead
which
strewed
the
road
was
to
be
seen
from
side
to
side
of
the
wide
horizon
the
royal
camp
was
immediately
seized
by
the
triumphant
scots
and
the
tent
of
king
edward
with
its
costly
furniture
was
sent
to
stirling
as
a
trophy
of
the
victory
chapter
stirling
many
chieftains
from
the
north
had
come
to
stirling
to
be
near
intelligence
from
the
borders
they
were
aware
that
this
meeting
between
wallace
and
edward
must
be
the
crisis
of
their
fate
the
few
who
remained
in
the
citadel
of
those
who
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
opening
of
this
glorious
revolution
for
their
country
were
full
of
sanguine
expectations
they
had
seen
the
prowess
of
their
leader
they
had
shared
the
glory
of
his
destiny
and
they
feared
not
that
edward
would
deprive
him
of
one
ray
but
they
who
at
their
utmost
wilds
of
highlands
had
only
heard
his
fame
though
they
had
afterward
seen
him
amongst
themselves
transforming
the
into
a
civilized
man
and
disciplined
soldier
though
they
had
felt
the
effects
of
his
military
successes
yet
they
doubted
how
his
fortunes
might
stand
the
shock
of
edward
happy
star
the
lords
whom
he
had
released
from
the
southron
prisons
were
all
of
the
same
apprehensive
opinion
for
they
knew
what
numbers
edward
could
bring
against
the
scottish
power
and
how
hitherto
unrivaled
was
his
skill
in
the
field
now
thought
lord
badenoch
will
this
brave
scot
find
the
difference
between
fighting
with
the
officers
of
a
king
and
a
king
himself
contending
for
what
he
determines
shall
be
a
part
of
his
dominions
full
of
this
idea
and
resolving
never
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
edward
again
for
the
conduct
of
wallace
had
made
the
earl
ashamed
of
his
long
submission
to
the
usurpation
of
rights
to
which
he
had
a
claim
he
kept
a
vessel
in
readiness
at
the
mouth
of
the
forth
to
take
him
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
regent
defeat
should
arrive
far
from
the
sad
consequences
to
a
quiet
asylum
in
france
the
meditations
of
athol
buchan
and
march
were
of
a
different
tendency
it
was
their
design
on
the
earliest
intimation
of
such
intelligence
to
set
forth
and
be
the
first
to
throw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
edward
and
acknowledge
him
their
sovereign
thus
with
various
projects
in
their
heads
which
none
but
the
three
last
breathed
to
each
other
were
several
hundred
expecting
chiefs
assembled
round
the
earl
of
mar
when
edwin
ruthven
glowing
with
all
the
effulgence
of
his
general
glory
and
his
own
rushed
into
the
hall
and
throwing
the
royal
standard
of
england
on
the
ground
exclaimed
there
lies
the
supremacy
of
king
edward
every
man
started
to
his
feet
you
do
not
mean
cried
athol
that
king
edward
has
been
beaten
he
has
been
beaten
and
driven
off
the
field
returned
edwin
these
dispatches
added
he
laying
them
on
the
table
before
his
uncle
will
relate
every
particular
a
hard
battle
our
regent
fought
for
our
enemies
were
numberless
but
a
thousand
good
angels
were
his
allies
and
edward
himself
fled
i
saw
the
king
after
he
had
thrice
rallied
his
troops
and
brought
them
to
the
charge
at
last
turn
and
fly
it
was
at
that
moment
i
wounded
his
and
seized
this
dragon
thou
art
worthy
of
thy
general
brave
ruthven
cried
badenoch
to
edwin
james
added
he
addressing
his
eldest
son
who
had
just
arrived
from
france
what
is
left
to
us
to
show
ourselves
also
of
scottish
blood
heaven
has
given
him
all
lord
mar
who
had
stood
in
speechless
gratitude
opened
the
dispatches
and
finding
a
circumstantial
narrative
of
the
battle
with
accounts
of
the
previous
embassies
he
read
them
aloud
their
contents
excited
a
variety
of
emotions
when
the
nobles
heard
that
edward
had
offered
wallace
the
crown
when
they
found
that
by
vanquishing
that
powerful
monarch
he
had
subdued
even
the
soul
of
the
man
who
had
hitherto
held
them
all
in
awe
though
in
the
same
breath
they
read
that
their
regent
had
refused
royalty
and
was
now
as
a
servant
of
the
people
preparing
to
strengthen
their
borders
yet
the
most
extravagant
suspicions
awoke
in
almost
every
breast
the
eagle
flight
of
his
glory
seemed
to
have
raised
him
so
far
above
their
heads
so
beyond
their
power
to
restrain
or
to
elevate
him
that
an
envy
dark
as
erebus
a
jealousy
which
at
once
annihilated
every
grateful
sentiment
every
personal
regard
passed
like
electricity
from
heart
to
heart
the
eye
turning
from
one
to
the
other
explained
what
no
lip
dared
utter
a
dead
silence
reigned
while
the
demon
of
hatred
was
taking
possession
of
almost
every
beast
and
none
but
the
lords
mar
badenoch
and
escaped
the
black
contagion
when
the
meeting
broke
up
lord
mar
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
officers
of
the
garrison
and
with
a
herald
holding
the
banner
of
edward
beneath
the
colors
of
scotland
rode
forth
to
proclaim
to
the
country
the
decisive
victory
of
its
regent
badenoch
and
left
the
hall
to
hasten
with
the
tidings
to
snawdoun
the
rest
of
the
chiefs
dispersed
but
as
if
actuated
by
one
spirit
they
were
seen
wandering
about
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
they
soon
drew
together
in
groups
and
whispered
among
themselves
these
and
similar
statements
he
refused
the
crown
offered
to
him
in
the
field
by
the
people
he
rejected
it
from
edward
because
he
would
reign
uncontrolled
he
will
now
seize
it
as
a
conqueror
and
we
shall
have
an
upstart
foot
upon
our
necks
if
we
are
to
be
slaves
let
us
have
a
tyrant
of
our
own
choosing
as
the
trumpets
before
lord
mar
blew
the
loud
acclaim
of
triumph
athol
said
to
buchan
cousin
that
is
but
the
forerunner
of
what
we
shall
hear
to
announce
the
usurpation
of
this
wallace
and
shall
we
sit
tamely
by
and
have
our
birthright
wrested
from
us
by
a
man
of
yesterday
no
if
the
race
of
alexander
be
not
to
occupy
the
throne
let
us
not
hesitate
between
the
monarch
of
a
mighty
nation
and
a
tyrant
between
him
who
will
at
least
gild
our
chains
with
chivalric
honors
and
an
upstart
whose
domination
must
be
as
stern
as
debasing
murmurings
such
as
these
passing
from
chief
to
chief
descended
to
the
minor
chieftains
who
held
lands
in
fee
of
those
more
sovereign
lords
petty
interests
extinguished
gratitude
for
general
benefits
and
by
secret
meetings
at
the
heads
of
which
were
athol
buchan
and
march
a
conspiracy
was
formed
to
overset
the
power
of
wallace
they
were
to
invite
edward
once
more
to
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
and
meanwhile
to
accomplish
this
with
certainty
each
chief
was
to
assume
a
zeal
for
the
regent
march
was
to
persuade
wallace
to
send
him
to
dunbar
as
governor
of
the
lothiaus
to
hold
the
refractory
soulis
in
check
and
to
divide
the
public
cares
of
lord
dundaff
who
indeed
found
berwick
a
sufficient
charge
for
his
age
and
comparative
inactivity
then
cried
the
false
cospatrick
when
i
am
fixed
at
dunbar
edward
may
come
round
from
newcastle
to
that
port
and
by
your
management
he
must
march
unmolested
to
stirling
and
seize
the
usurper
on
his
throne
name
by
which
patrick
dunbar
earl
of
march
was
familiarly
called
such
suggestions
met
with
full
approval
from
these
dark
incendiaries
and
as
their
meetings
were
usually
held
at
night
they
walked
forth
in
the
day
with
cheerful
countenances
and
joined
the
general
rejoicing
they
feared
to
hint
even
a
word
of
their
intentions
to
lord
badenoch
for
on
buchan
having
expressed
some
discontent
to
him
at
the
homage
that
was
paid
to
a
man
so
much
their
inferior
his
answer
was
had
we
acted
worthy
of
our
birth
sir
william
wallace
never
could
have
had
the
opportunity
to
rise
upon
our
disgrace
but
as
it
is
we
must
submit
or
bow
to
treachery
instead
of
virtue
this
reply
determined
them
to
keep
their
proceedings
secret
from
him
and
also
from
lady
mar
for
both
lord
buchan
and
lord
athol
had
at
different
times
listened
to
the
fond
dreams
of
her
love
and
ambition
they
had
flattered
her
with
entering
into
her
designs
athol
gloomily
affected
acquiescence
that
he
might
render
himself
master
of
all
that
was
in
her
mind
and
perhaps
in
that
of
her
lover
for
he
did
not
doubt
that
wallace
was
as
guilty
as
her
wishes
would
have
made
him
and
buchan
ever
ready
to
yield
to
the
persuasions
of
woman
was
not
likely
to
refuse
when
his
fair
cousin
promised
to
reward
him
with
all
the
pleasures
of
the
gayest
court
in
europe
for
indeed
both
lords
had
conceived
from
the
evident
failing
state
of
her
veteran
husband
in
consequence
of
the
unhealing
condition
of
one
of
his
wounds
that
it
might
not
be
long
before
this
visionary
game
would
be
thrown
into
her
hands
thus
were
they
situated
when
the
news
of
wallace
decisive
victory
distancing
all
their
means
to
raise
him
who
was
now
at
the
pinnacle
of
power
determined
the
dubious
to
become
at
once
his
mortal
enemies
lord
badenoch
had
listened
with
a
different
temper
to
the
first
breathings
of
lady
mar
on
her
favorite
subject
he
told
her
if
the
nation
chose
to
make
their
benefactor
king
he
should
not
oppose
it
because
he
thought
that
none
of
the
blood
royal
deserved
to
wear
the
crown
which
they
had
all
consented
to
hold
in
fee
of
edward
yet
he
would
never
promote
by
intrigue
an
election
which
must
rob
his
own
posterity
of
their
inheritance
but
when
she
gave
hints
of
her
becoming
one
day
the
wife
of
wallace
he
turned
on
her
with
a
frown
cousin
said
he
beware
how
you
allow
so
guilty
an
idea
to
take
possession
of
your
heart
it
is
the
parent
of
dishonor
and
death
and
did
i
think
that
sir
william
wallace
were
capable
of
sharing
your
wishes
i
would
be
the
first
to
abandon
his
standard
but
i
believe
him
too
virtuous
to
look
on
a
married
woman
with
the
eyes
of
passion
and
that
he
holds
the
houses
of
mar
and
cummin
in
too
high
a
respect
to
breathe
an
illicit
sigh
in
the
ear
of
my
kinswoman
despairing
of
making
the
impression
she
desired
on
the
mind
of
this
severe
relative
lady
mar
spoke
to
him
no
more
on
the
subject
and
lord
badenoch
ignorant
that
she
had
imparted
her
criminal
project
to
his
brother
and
cousin
believed
that
his
reproof
had
performed
her
cure
thus
flattering
himself
he
made
no
hesitations
to
be
the
first
who
should
go
to
snawdoun
to
communicate
to
her
the
brilliant
dispatches
of
the
regent
and
to
declare
the
freedom
of
scotland
to
be
now
almost
secured
he
and
lord
set
forth
but
they
had
been
some
time
preceded
by
edwin
the
moment
the
countess
heard
the
name
of
her
nephew
announced
she
made
a
sign
for
her
ladies
to
withdraw
and
starting
forward
at
his
entrance
speak
cried
she
tell
me
edwin
is
the
regent
still
a
conqueror
where
are
my
mother
and
helen
replied
he
to
share
my
tidings
then
they
are
good
exclaimed
lady
mar
with
one
of
her
bewitching
smiles
ah
you
sly
one
like
your
chief
you
know
your
power
and
like
him
i
exercise
it
replied
he
gayly
therefore
to
keep
your
ladyship
no
longer
in
suspense
here
is
a
letter
from
the
regent
himself
he
presented
it
as
he
spoke
and
she
catching
it
from
him
turned
round
and
pressing
it
rapturously
to
her
lips
it
being
the
first
she
had
ever
received
from
him
eagerly
ran
over
its
brief
contents
while
reperusing
it
for
she
could
not
tear
her
eyes
from
the
beloved
characters
lady
ruthven
and
helen
entered
the
room
the
former
hastened
forward
the
latter
trembled
as
she
moved
for
she
did
not
yet
know
the
information
which
her
cousin
brought
but
the
first
glance
of
his
face
told
her
all
was
safe
and
as
he
broke
from
his
mother
embrace
to
clasp
helen
in
his
arms
she
fell
upon
his
neck
and
with
a
shower
of
tears
whispered
wallace
lives
is
well
as
you
would
wish
him
rewhispered
he
and
with
edward
at
his
feet
thank
god
thank
god
while
she
spoke
lady
ruthven
exclaimed
but
how
is
our
regent
speak
edwin
how
is
the
delight
of
all
hearts
still
the
lord
of
scotland
answered
he
the
invincible
dictator
of
her
enemies
the
puissant
edward
has
acknowledged
the
power
of
sir
william
wallace
and
after
being
beaten
on
the
plain
of
stanmore
is
now
making
the
best
of
his
way
toward
his
own
capital
lady
mar
again
and
again
pressed
the
cold
letter
of
wallace
to
her
burning
bosom
the
regent
does
not
mention
these
matters
in
his
letter
to
me
said
she
casting
an
exulting
glance
over
the
glowing
face
of
helen
but
helen
did
not
notice
it
she
was
listening
to
edwin
who
with
joyous
animation
related
every
particular
that
had
befallen
wallace
from
the
time
of
his
rejoining
him
to
that
very
moment
the
countess
heard
all
with
complacency
till
he
mentioned
the
issue
of
the
conference
with
edward
first
embassadors
fool
exclaimed
she
to
herself
to
throw
away
the
golden
opportunity
that
may
never
return
not
observing
her
disturbance
edwin
went
on
with
his
narrative
every
word
of
which
spread
the
eloquent
countenance
of
helen
with
admiration
and
joy
since
her
heroic
heart
had
wrung
from
it
all
selfish
wishes
with
regard
to
wallace
she
allowed
herself
to
openly
rejoice
in
his
success
and
to
look
up
unabashed
when
the
resplendent
glories
of
his
character
were
brought
before
her
none
but
edwin
made
her
feel
her
exclusion
from
her
soul
only
home
by
dwelling
on
his
gentle
virtues
by
portraying
the
exquisite
tenderness
of
his
nature
which
seemed
to
enfold
the
objects
of
his
love
in
his
heart
of
hearts
when
helen
thought
on
these
discourses
she
would
sigh
but
it
was
a
sigh
of
resignation
and
she
loved
to
meditate
on
the
words
which
edwin
had
carelessly
spoken
that
she
made
herself
a
nun
for
wallace
and
so
i
will
said
she
to
herself
and
that
resolution
stills
every
wild
emotion
all
is
innocence
in
heaven
wallace
you
will
there
read
my
soul
and
love
me
as
a
sister
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
did
she
listen
to
the
relation
of
edwin
did
her
animated
eye
welcome
the
entrance
of
badenoch
and
and
their
enthusiastic
encomiums
on
the
lord
of
her
heart
then
sounded
the
trumpet
and
the
herald
voice
in
the
streets
proclaimed
the
victory
of
the
regent
lady
mar
rushed
to
the
window
as
if
there
she
would
see
himself
lady
ruthven
followed
and
as
the
acclamations
of
the
people
echoed
through
the
air
helen
pressed
the
precious
cross
of
wallace
to
her
bosom
and
hastily
left
the
room
to
enjoy
the
rapture
of
her
thoughts
in
the
blessed
retirement
of
her
own
oratory
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
after
the
promulgation
of
all
this
happy
intelligence
it
was
announced
that
the
regent
was
on
his
return
to
stirling
lady
mar
was
not
so
inebriated
with
her
vain
hopes
as
to
forget
that
helen
might
traverse
the
dearest
of
them
should
she
again
present
herself
to
its
object
she
therefore
hastened
to
her
when
the
time
of
his
expected
arrival
drew
near
and
putting
on
all
the
matron
affected
to
give
her
the
counsel
of
a
mother
as
all
the
noble
families
around
stirling
would
assemble
to
hail
the
victor
return
the
countess
said
she
came
to
advise
her
in
consideration
of
what
had
passed
in
the
chapel
before
the
departure
not
to
submit
herself
to
the
observation
of
so
many
eyes
not
suspecting
the
occult
devices
which
worked
in
her
heart
helen
meekly
acquiesced
with
the
reply
i
shall
obey
but
she
inwardly
thought
i
who
know
the
heroism
of
his
soul
need
not
pageants
nor
acclamations
of
the
multitude
to
tell
me
what
he
is
he
is
already
too
bring
for
my
senses
to
support
and
with
his
image
pressing
on
my
heart
it
is
mercy
to
let
me
shrink
from
his
glorious
presence
the
obey
was
sufficient
for
lady
mar
she
had
gained
her
point
for
though
she
did
not
seriously
think
what
she
had
affected
to
believe
that
anything
more
had
passed
between
wallace
and
helen
than
what
they
had
openly
declared
yet
she
could
not
but
discern
the
harmony
of
their
minds
and
she
feared
that
frequent
intercourse
might
draw
such
sympathy
to
something
dearer
she
had
understanding
to
perceive
his
virtues
but
they
found
no
answering
qualities
in
her
breast
the
matchless
beauty
of
his
person
the
penetrating
tenderness
of
his
manner
the
splendor
of
his
fame
the
magnitude
of
his
power
all
united
to
set
her
impassioned
and
ambitious
soul
in
a
blaze
each
opposing
duty
seemed
only
a
vapor
through
which
she
could
easily
pass
to
the
goal
of
her
desire
hence
art
of
every
kind
appeared
to
her
to
be
no
more
than
a
means
of
acquiring
the
object
most
valuable
to
her
in
life
education
had
not
given
her
any
principle
by
which
she
might
have
checked
the
headlong
impulse
of
her
now
aroused
passions
brought
up
as
a
worshiped
object
in
the
little
court
of
her
parents
at
kirkwall
in
the
orkneys
her
father
the
earl
of
strathern
in
scotland
and
her
mother
being
a
princess
of
norway
whose
dowry
brought
him
the
sovereignty
of
those
isles
their
daughter
never
knew
any
law
but
her
own
will
from
her
doting
mother
and
on
the
fearful
loss
of
that
mother
in
a
marine
excursion
of
pleasure
by
an
accident
oversetting
the
boat
she
was
in
the
bereaved
daughter
fell
into
such
a
despair
on
her
first
pang
of
grief
of
any
kind
that
her
similarly
distracted
father
whose
little
dominions
happened
then
to
be
menaced
by
a
descent
of
the
danes
sought
a
safe
and
cheering
home
for
his
only
child
at
the
interesting
age
of
seventeen
by
sending
her
over
sea
to
the
protecting
care
of
his
friend
the
earl
of
mar
and
to
his
lovely
countess
then
an
only
three
years
wife
with
one
infant
daughter
though
fond
of
admiration
the
young
joanna
of
orkney
had
held
herself
at
too
high
a
price
to
bestow
a
thought
on
the
crowd
of
rough
sons
of
the
surge
chiefs
of
the
surrounding
isles
who
owned
her
father
as
lord
who
daily
adulated
her
charms
with
all
the
costliest
trophies
from
their
she
trod
past
them
and
by
all
the
female
beauties
in
her
isle
with
the
step
of
an
undisputed
right
to
receive
and
to
despise
but
when
she
crossed
to
the
mainland
and
found
herself
by
the
side
of
a
woman
almost
as
young
as
herself
and
equally
beautiful
though
of
a
different
mold
soft
and
retreating
while
hers
commanded
and
compelled
and
that
the
husband
of
that
woman
whose
tender
adoration
hovered
over
her
with
a
perpetual
eye
that
he
though
of
comparative
veteran
years
was
handsomer
than
any
man
she
had
ever
seen
and
fraught
with
every
noble
grace
to
delight
the
female
heart
she
felt
what
she
had
never
done
before
that
she
had
met
a
rival
and
an
object
worthy
to
subdue
what
joanna
began
in
mere
excited
vanity
jealous
pride
and
ambition
of
conquest
ended
in
a
fatal
attachment
to
the
husband
of
her
innocent
and
too
confiding
protectress
and
he
alas
betrayed
first
by
her
insidious
wiles
and
then
by
her
overpowering
and
apparently
restrainless
demonstrations
of
devoted
love
was
so
far
won
from
the
propriety
of
his
noble
heart
as
to
regard
with
a
grateful
admiration
as
well
as
a
manly
pity
the
beautiful
victim
of
a
passion
he
had
so
unwittingly
raised
in
the
midst
of
these
scenes
too
often
acted
for
his
peace
though
not
for
his
honor
and
fidelity
to
his
marriage
vow
his
beloved
isabella
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
till
then
the
joy
of
his
life
died
in
the
pangs
of
a
premature
confinement
breathing
her
last
sigh
in
the
birth
of
a
daughter
scarcely
was
the
countess
consigned
to
her
bed
of
earth
and
even
in
the
hour
after
the
last
duties
were
paid
to
her
whose
closed
tomb
seemed
to
have
left
unto
him
his
house
desolate
when
the
joanna
rushed
into
the
weeping
husband
presence
fearful
of
being
now
restrainingly
reclaimed
by
her
father
who
had
only
a
short
while
before
intimated
his
intention
to
relieve
his
friends
of
a
guardianship
they
had
so
partially
fulfilled
and
to
send
a
vessel
for
his
daughter
to
bring
her
back
to
kirkwall
there
to
be
united
in
marriage
to
the
brave
native
chieftain
whose
singular
prowess
had
preserved
the
island
from
a
danish
yoke
dreading
this
event
even
while
her
siren
tears
mingled
with
those
of
the
widowed
mar
she
wrought
on
him
by
lavish
protestations
of
a
devoted
love
for
his
two
infant
orphans
helen
then
a
child
of
hardly
two
years
and
the
poor
babe
whose
existence
had
just
cost
its
mother
her
life
also
of
a
dedication
of
herself
to
that
mother
memory
and
to
the
tenderest
consolations
of
his
own
mourning
spirit
she
wrought
upon
him
to
rescue
her
from
her
abhorrent
fate
even
to
give
her
his
vow
to
wed
her
himself
in
the
weakness
of
an
almost
prostrated
mind
under
the
load
of
conflicting
anguish
which
then
lay
upon
him
for
now
feeling
his
own
culpable
infirmity
in
having
suffered
this
dangerously
flattering
preference
of
him
to
have
ever
showed
itself
to
him
without
his
having
down
his
positive
duty
by
sending
her
home
at
once
to
her
proper
protector
in
a
sudden
agony
of
he
assented
to
her
supplication
that
as
soon
as
propriety
would
permit
she
should
become
his
wife
the
earl
of
strathern
arrived
himself
within
the
week
to
condole
with
his
friend
and
to
take
back
his
daughter
but
the
scene
he
met
changed
his
ultimate
purpose
joanna
declared
that
were
she
to
be
carried
away
to
marry
any
man
save
that
friend
whose
protection
during
the
last
six
months
had
been
to
her
as
that
of
all
relatives
in
one
she
should
expire
on
the
threshold
of
castle
braemer
for
she
never
would
cross
it
alive
and
as
the
melancholy
widower
but
grateful
lover
verified
his
vow
to
her
by
repeating
it
to
her
father
within
four
months
from
that
day
the
earl
of
mar
rejoined
the
lady
joanna
at
kirkwall
and
brought
her
away
as
his
bride
but
to
avoid
exciting
any
invidious
remarks
by
immediately
appearing
in
scotland
after
such
prompt
nuptials
the
new
countess
wary
in
her
triumph
easily
persuaded
her
husband
to
take
her
for
awhile
to
france
where
assuming
a
cold
and
majestic
demeanor
which
she
thought
becoming
her
royal
descent
she
resided
several
years
thus
changed
she
returned
to
scotland
she
found
the
suspicion
of
any
former
indiscretion
faded
from
all
minds
and
passing
her
time
in
the
stately
hospitalities
of
her
lord
castles
conducted
herself
with
a
matronly
dignity
that
made
him
the
envy
of
all
the
married
chieftains
in
his
neighborhood
soon
after
her
arrival
at
kildrumy
on
the
river
dee
her
then
most
favorite
residence
she
took
the
lady
helen
the
supplanted
isabella
daughter
from
her
grandfather
at
thirlestance
where
both
children
had
been
left
on
the
departure
of
their
father
and
his
bride
for
france
though
hardly
past
the
period
of
absolute
childhood
the
lord
soulis
at
this
time
offered
the
young
heiress
of
mar
his
hand
the
countess
had
then
no
interest
in
wishing
the
union
having
not
yet
any
children
of
her
own
to
make
her
jealous
for
their
father
love
she
permitted
her
to
decide
as
she
pleased
a
second
time
he
presented
himself
and
lady
mar
still
indifferent
allowed
helen
a
second
time
to
refuse
him
years
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
pair
but
while
they
whitened
the
raven
locks
of
the
earl
and
withered
his
manly
brow
the
beauty
of
his
countess
blew
into
fuller
luxuriance
yet
it
was
her
mirror
aloe
that
told
her
she
was
fairer
than
all
the
ladies
around
for
none
durst
invade
the
serene
decorum
of
her
manners
with
so
light
a
whisper
such
was
her
state
when
she
first
heard
of
the
rise
of
sir
william
wallace
and
when
she
thought
that
her
husband
might
not
only
lose
his
life
but
risk
the
forfeiture
of
his
family
honors
by
joining
him
for
her
own
sake
and
for
her
children
having
recently
become
the
mother
of
twins
she
had
then
determined
if
it
were
necessary
to
make
the
outlawed
chief
a
sacrifice
to
this
end
she
became
willing
to
bribe
soulis
participation
by
the
hand
of
helen
she
knew
that
her
abhorred
his
character
but
love
indifference
or
hatred
she
now
thought
of
little
consequence
in
a
marriage
which
brought
sufficient
antidotes
in
rank
and
wealth
she
had
never
felt
what
real
love
was
and
her
personal
vanity
being
no
longer
agitated
by
the
raptures
of
a
frantic
rivalry
she
now
lived
tranquilly
with
lord
mar
what
then
was
her
astonishment
what
the
wild
distraction
of
her
heart
when
she
first
beheld
sir
william
wallace
and
found
in
her
breast
for
him
all
which
in
the
moment
of
the
most
unreflecting
intoxication
she
had
ever
felt
for
her
lord
with
the
addition
of
feelings
and
sentiments
the
existence
of
which
she
had
never
believed
but
now
knew
in
all
their
force
love
for
the
first
time
penetrated
through
every
nerve
of
her
body
and
possessed
her
whole
mind
taught
a
theory
of
virtue
by
her
husband
she
was
startled
at
wishes
which
militated
against
his
honor
but
no
principles
being
grounded
in
her
mind
they
soon
disappeared
before
the
furious
charge
of
his
passions
and
after
a
short
struggle
she
surrendered
herself
to
the
lawless
power
of
a
guilty
and
ambitious
love
wishes
hopes
and
designs
which
two
years
before
she
would
have
shuddered
at
as
not
only
sinful
but
derogatory
to
female
delicacy
she
now
embraced
with
ardor
and
naught
seemed
dreadful
to
her
but
disappointment
the
prolonged
life
of
lord
mar
cost
her
many
tears
for
the
of
her
nature
which
she
had
laid
asleep

violence

the
most

and
she

he

great
and
her
ambition
blazed
into
an
unextinguishable
flame
these
two
strong
passions
meeting
in
a
breast
weakened
by
the
besetting
sin
of
her
youth
their
rule
was
absolute
and
neither
virtue
honor
nor
humanity
could
stand
before
them
her
husband
was
abhorred
her
infant
son
forgotten
and
nothing
but
wallace
and
a
crown
could
find
a
place

her
thoughts

of
wallace
a
few
months
ago
a
despised
outlaw
at
this
moment
the
idol
of
the
nation
and
then
turned
to
herself
the
wooed
of
many
a
gallant
heart
and
now
devoted
to
one
whom
like
the
sun
she
must
ever
contemplate
with
admiration
while
he
should
pass
on
above
her
sphere
unconscious
of
the
devotion
which
filled
her
soul
the
distant
murmur
of
the
populace
thronging
out
of
the
streets
toward
the
carse
gradually
subsided
and
at
last
she
was
left
in
profound
silence
he
must
be
near
thought
she
he
whose
smile
is
more
precious
to
me
than
the
adulation
of
all
the
world
besides
now
smiles
upon
every
one
all
look
upon
him
all
hear
him
but
i
and
i
ah
wallace
did
marion
love
thee
dearer
as
her
devoted
heart
demanded
this
question
her
tender
and
delicate
soul
shrunk
within
herself
and
deeply
blushing
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
a
pause
of
a
few
minutes
and
a
sound
as
if
the
skies
were
rent
tore
the
air
a
noise
like
the
distant
roar
of
the
sea
succeeded
and
soon
after
the
shouts
of
an
approaching
multitude
shook
the
palace
to
its
foundations
helen
started
on
her
feet
the
tumult
of
voices
augmented
the
sound
of
coming
squadrons
thundered
over
the
ground
at
this
instant
every
bell
in
the
city
began
its
peals
and
the
door
of
helen
room
suddenly
opened
lady
ruthven
hurried
in
helen
cried
she
i
would
not
disturb
you
before
but
as
you
were
to
be
absent
i
would
not
make
one
in
lady
mar
train
and
i
come
to
enjoy
with
you
the
return
of
our
beloved
regent
helen
did
not
speak
but
her
eloquent
countenance
amply
told
her
aunt
what
were
the
emotions
of
her
heart
and
lady
ruthven
taking
her
hand
attempted
to
draw
her
toward
an
oriel
window
which
opened
to
a
view
of
the
high
street
but
helen
shrinking
from
the
movement
begged
to
be
excused
i
hear
enough
said
she
my
dear
aunt
sights
like
these
overcome
me
let
me
remain
where
i
am
lady
ruthven
was
going
to
remonstrate
when
the
loud
huzzas
of
the
people
and
soldiers
accompanied
by
acclamations
of
long
live
victorious
wallace
our
prince
and
king
struck
helen
back
into
her
seat
and
lady
ruthven
darting
toward
the
window
cried
aloud
he
comes
helen
he
comes
his
bonnet
off
his
noble
brow
oh
how
princely
does
he
look
and
now
he
bows
ah
they
shower
flowers
upon
him
from
the
houses
on
each
side
of
the
street
how
sweetly
he
smiles
and
bows
to
the
ladies
as
they
lean
from
their
windows
come
helen
come
if
you
would
see
the
perfection
of
majesty
and
modesty
united
in
one
helen
did
not
move
but
lady
ruthven
stretching
out
her
arm
in
a
moment
had
drawn
her
within
view
of
wallace
she
saw
him
attended
as
a
conqueror
and
a
king
but
with
the
eyes
of
a
benefactor
and
a
brother
he
looked
on
all
around
the
very
memory
of
war
seemed
to
vanish
before
his
presence
for
all
there
was
love
and
gentleness
helen
drew
a
quick
sigh
and
closing
her
eyes
dropped
against
the
arras
she
now
heard
the
buzz
of
many
voices
the
rolling
peal
of
acclamations
but
she
distinguished
nothing
her
senses
were
in
tumults
and
had
not
lady
ruthven
seen
her
disorder
she
would
have
fallen
motionless
to
the
floor
the
good
matron
was
not
so
forgetful
of
the
feelings
of
a
virtuous
youthful
heart
not
to
have
discovered
something
of
what
was
passing
in
that
of
her
niece
from
the
moment
in
which
she
had
suspected
that
wallace
had
made
a
serious
impression
there
she
dropped
all
trifling
with
his
name
and
now
that
she
saw
the
distressing
effects
of
that
impression
with
revulsed
feelings
she
took
the
fainting
helen
in
her
arms
and
laying
her
on
a
couch
by
the
aid
of
volatiles
restored
her
to
recollection
seeing
she
recovered
she
made
no
observation
on
this
emotion
and
helen
leaned
her
head
and
wept
upon
the
bosom
of
her
aunt
lady
ruthven
tears
silently
mingled
with
hers
but
she
said
within
herself
wallace
can
not
be
always
insensible
to
so
much
excellence
as
the
acclaiming
populace
passed
the
palace
on
their
way
to
the
citadel
whither
they
were
escorting
their
regent
helen
remained
quiet
in
her
leaning
position
but
when
the
noise
died
away
into
hoarse
murmurs
she
raised
her
head
and
glancing
on
the
face
of
her
affectionate
aunt
said
with
a
forced
smile
my
more
than
mother
fear
me
not
i
am
grateful
to
sir
william
wallace
i
venerate
him
as
the
southrons
do
their
george
but
i
need
not
your
tender
pity
as
she
spoke
her
beautiful
lip
quivered
but
her
voice
was
steady
my
sweetest
helen
replied
lady
ruthven
how
can
i
pity
her
for
whom
i
hope
everything
hope
nothing
for
me
returned
helen
understanding
by
her
looks
what
her
tongue
had
left
unsaid
but
to
see
me
a
vestal
here
and
a
saint
in
heaven
what
can
my
helen
mean
replied
lady
ruthven
who
would
talk
of
being
a
vestal
with
such
a
heart
in
view
as
that
of
the
regent
of
scotland
and
that
it
will
be
yours
does
not
his
eloquent
gratitude
declare
no
my
aunt
answered
helen
casting
down
her
eyes
gratitude
is
eloquent
where
love
would
be
silent
i
am
not
so
sacrilegious
as
to
wish
that
sir
william
wallace
should
transfer
that
heart
to
me
which
the
blood
of
marion
forever
purchased
no
should
these
people
compel
him
to
be
their
king
i
will
retire
to
some
monastery
and
forever
devote
myself
to
god
and
to
prayers
for
my
country
the
holy
composure
which
spread
over
the
countenance
and
figure
of
helen
as
she
uttered
this
seemed
to
extend
itself
to
the
before
eager
mind
of
lady
ruthven
she
pressed
her
tenderly
in
her
arms
and
kissing
her
gentlest
of
human
beings
cried
she
whatever
be
thy
lot
it
must
be
happy
whatever
it
be
answered
helen
i
know
that
there
is
an
almighty
reason
for
it
i
shall
understand
it
in
the
world
to
come
and
i
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
this
oh
that
the
ears
of
wallace
could
hear
thee
cried
lady
ruthven
they
will
some
time
my
gracious
aunt
answered
she
with
an
angelic
smile
when
where
dearest
asked
lady
ruthven
hoping
that
she
began
to
have
fairer
anticipations
for
herself
helen
answered
not
but
pointing
to
the
sky
rose
from
her
seat
with
an
air
as
if
she
were
really
going
to
ascend
to
those
regions
which
seemed
best
fitted
to
receive
her
pure
spirit
lady
ruthven
gazed
on
her
in
speechless
admiration
and
without
a
word
or
an
impeding
motion
felt
helen
softly
kiss
her
hand
and
with
another
seraphic
smile
glide
gently
from
her
into
her
closet
and
close
the
door
far
different
were
the
emotions
which
agitated
the
bosoms
of
every
person
present
at
the
entry
of
sir
william
wallace
all
but
himself
regarded
it
as
the
triumph
of
the
king
of
scotland
and
while
some
of
the
nobles
exulted
in
their
future
monarch
the
major
part
felt
the
demon
of
envy
so
possess
their
souls
that
they
who
before
his
arrival
were
ready
to
worship
his
name
now
looked
on
the
empire
to
which
he
seemed
borne
on
the
hearts
of
the
people
with
a
rancorous
jealousy
which
from
that
moment
vowed
his
humiliation
or
the
fall
of
scotland
the
very
tongues
which
in
general
acclaim
called
loudest
long
live
our
king
belonged
to
those
who
in
the
secret
recesses
of
their
souls
swore
to
work
his
ruin
and
to
make
these
honors
the
means
of
his
destruction
he
had
in
vain
tried
to
check
what
his
moderate
desires
deemed
the
extravagant
gratitude
of
the
people
but
finding
his
efforts
only
excited
still
louder
demonstrations
of
their
love
and
knowing
himself
immovable
in
his
resolution
to
remain
a
subject
of
the
crown
he
rode
on
composedly
toward
the
citadel
those
ladies
who
had
not
retired
from
the
cavalcade
to
hail
their
regent
a
second
time
from
their
windows
preceded
him
in
lady
train
to
the
hall
where
she
had
caused
a
sumptuous
feast
to
be
spread
to
greet
his
arrival
two
seats
were
placed
under
a
canopy
of
cloth
of
gold
at
the
head
of
the
board
the
countess
stood
there
in
all
the
splendor
of
her
ideal
rank
and
would
have
seated
wallace
in
the
royal
chair
on
her
right
hand
but
he
drew
back
i
am
only
a
guest
in
this
citadel
returned
he
and
it
would
ill
become
me
to
take
the
place
of
the
master
of
the
banquet
as
he
spoke
he
looked
on
lord
mar
who
understanding
the
language
of
his
eyes
which
never
said
the
thing
he
would
not
without
a
word
took
the
kingly
seat
and
so
disappointed
the
countess
by
this
refusal
she
still
found
herself
as
no
more
than
the
governor
of
stirling
wife
when
she
had
hoped
a
compliance
with
her
cunning
arrangement
would
have
hinted
to
all
that
she
was
to
be
the
future
queen
of
their
acknowledged
sovereign
they
knew
wallace
saw
his
unshaken
resolution
in
this
apparently
slight
action
but
others
who
read
his
design
in
their
own
ambition
translated
it
differently
and
deemed
it
only
an
artful
rejection
of
the
appendages
of
royalty
to
excite
the
impatience
of
the
people
to
crown
him
in
reality
as
the
ladies
took
their
seats
at
the
board
edwin
who
stood
by
the
chair
of
his
beloved
lord
whispered
our
helen
is
not
here
lady
mar
overheard
the
name
of
helen
but
she
could
not
distinguish
wallace
reply
and
fearing
that
some
second
assignation
of
more
happy
termination
than
that
of
the
chapel
might
be
designed
she
determined
that
if
edwin
were
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
secret
correspondence
between
the
man
she
loved
and
the
daughter
she
hated
to
deprive
them
speedily
of
so
ready
an
assistant
chapter
lii
banks
of
the
forth
in
the
collected
council
of
the
following
day
the
earl
of
march
made
his
treacherous
request
and
wallace
trusting
his
vehement
oaths
of
fidelity
because
he
thought
the
versatile
earl
had
now
discovered
his
true
interest
granted
him
charge
of
the
lothians
the
lords
athol
and
buchan
were
not
backward
in
offering
their
services
to
the
regent
and
the
rest
of
the
discontented
nobles
following
the
base
example
with
equal
deceit
bade
him
command
their
lives
and
fortunes
while
asseverations
of
loyalty
filled
the
walls
of
the
and
the
lauding
rejoicings
of
the
people
still
sounded
from
without
all
spoke
of
security
and
confidence
to
wallace
and
never
perhaps
did
he
think
himself
so
absolute
in
the
heart
of
scotland
as
at
the
very
moment
when
of
its
nobility
were
plotting
his
destruction
lord
knew
his
own
influence
in
the
minds
of
the
bravest
chieftains
from
the
extent
of
his
territories
and
his
tried
valor
he
might
well
have
assumed
the
title
of
his
great
ancestor
and
been
called
king
of
woody
morven
but
he
was
content
with
a
patriarch
sway
over
so
many
valiant
clans
and
previous
to
the
regent
appearance
in
the
he
opened
his
intentions
to
the
assembled
lords
some
assented
with
real
satisfaction
the
rest
readily
acquiesced
in
what
they
had
laid
so
sure
a
plan
to
circumvent
wallace
soon
after
entered
rising
stood
forth
before
him
and
in
a
long
and
persuasive
speech
once
more
declared
the
wishes
of
the
nation
that
he
would
strike
the
decisive
blow
on
the
pretensions
of
edward
by
himself
accepting
the
crown
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
with
al
the
eloquence
of
learning
and
the
most
animated
devotion
to
the
interest
of
scotland
seconded
the
petition
mar
and
bothwell
enforced
it
the
disaffected
lords
thought
proper
to
throw
in
their
conjurations
also
and
every
voice
but
that
of
badenoch
poured
forth
fervent
entreaties
that
he
their
liberator
would
grant
the
supplication
of
the
nation
wallace
rose
and
every
tongue
was
mute
my
gratitude
to
scotland
increases
with
my
life
but
my
answer
must
still
be
the
same
i
can
not
be
its
king
at
these
words
the
venerable
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
him
in
my
person
cried
he
see
scotland
at
your
feet
still
bleeding
with
the
effects
of
former
struggles
for
empire
she
would
throw
off
all
claims
but
those
of
virtue
and
receive
as
her
anointed
sovereign
her
father
and
deliverer
she
has
no
more
arguments
to
utter
these
are
her
prayers
and
thus
i
offer
them
kneel
not
to
me
brave
cried
wallace
nor
believe
the
might
of
these
victories
lies
so
thoroughly
on
this
arm
that
i
dare
outrage
its
maker
were
i
to
comply
with
your
wishes
i
should
disobey
him
who
has
hitherto
made
me
his
happy
agent
and
how
could
i
guard
my
kingdom
from
his
vengeance
your
rightful
king
yet
lives
he
is
an
alien
from
his
country
but
heaven
may
return
him
to
your
prayers
meanwhile
as
his
representative
as
your
soldier
and
protector
i
shall
be
blessed
in
wearing
out
my
life
my
ancestors
were
ever
faithful
to
the
blood
of
alexander
and
in
the
same
fidelity
i
will
die
the
firmness
with
which
he
spoke
and
the
determined
expression
of
his
noble
countenance
convinced
that
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
and
rising
from
his
knee
he
bowed
in
silence
march
whispered
to
buchan
behold
the
hypocrite
but
we
shall
unmask
him
he
thinks
to
blind
us
to
his
towering
ambition
by
this
affected
moderation
he
will
not
be
called
a
king
because
with
our
own
crown
certain
limitations
are
laid
on
the
prerogative
but
he
will
be
our
regent
that
he
may
be
our
dictator
and
every
day
demand
gratitude
for
voluntary
services
which
performed
as
a
king
could
only
be
considered
as
his
duty
when
the
council
broke
up
these
sentiments
were
actively
disseminated
among
the
disaffected
throng
and
each
gloomy
recess
in
the
woods
murmured
with
seditious
meetings
but
every
lip
in
the
country
at
large
breathed
the
name
of
wallace
as
they
would
have
done
a
god
while
the
land
that
he
had
blessed
bloomed
on
every
hill
and
valley
like
a
garden
stirling
now
exhibited
a
constant
carnival
peace
was
in
every
heart
and
joy
its
companion
as
wallace
had
commanded
in
the
field
he
decided
in
the
and
while
all
his
behests
were
obeyed
with
a
promptitude
which
kept
the
machine
of
state
constantly
moving
in
the
most
beautiful
order
his
bitterest
enemies
could
not
but
secretly
acknowledge
the
perfection
they
were
determined
to
destroy
his
munificent
hand
stretched
itself
far
and
near
that
all
who
had
shared
the
sufferings
of
scotland
might
drink
largely
of
her
prosperity
the
good
abbot
of
scone
was
invited
from
his
hermitage
and
when
he
heard
from
the
embassadors
sent
to
him
that
the
brave
young
warrior
whom
he
had
entertained
was
the
resistless
wallace
he
no
longer
thought
of
the
distant
and
supine
bruce
but
centered
every
wish
for
his
country
in
the
authority
of
her
deliverer
a
few
days
brought
him
to
stirling
and
wishing
to
remain
near
the
most
constant
residence
of
his
noble
friend
he
requested
that
instead
of
being
restored
to
scone
he
might
be
installed
in
the
vacant
monastery
of
wallace
gladly
acquiesced
and
the
venerable
abbot
being
told
that
his
late
charge
the
lady
helen
was
in
the
palace
went
to
visit
her
and
as
he
communicated
his
exultation
and
happiness
she
rejoiced
in
the
benedictions
which
his
grateful
spirit
invoked
on
the
head
of
her
almost
worshiped
sovereign
her
heart
gave
him
his
title
which
she
believed
the
affection
of
the
people
would
at
last
force
him
to
accept
the
wives
and
families
of
the
lanark
veterans
were
brought
from
loch
doine
and
again
planted
in
their
native
valleys
thus
naught
in
the
kingdom
appeared
different
from
its
most
prosperous
days
but
the
widowed
heart
of
the
dispenser
of
all
this
good
and
yet
so
fully
did
he
engage
himself
in
the
creation
of
these
benefits
that
no
time
seemed
left
to
him
for
regrets
but
they
haunted
him
like
persecuting
spirits
invisible
to
all
but
himself
during
the
performance
of
these
things
the
countess
of
mar
though
apparently
lost
to
all
other
pursuits
than
the
peaceable
enjoyment
of
her
reflected
dignities
was
absorbed
in
the
one
great
object
of
her
passion
eager
to
be
rid
of
so
dangerous
a
spy
and
adversary
as
she
deemed
edwin
to
be
she
was
laboring
day
and
night
to
effect
by
clandestine
schemes
his
banishment
when
an
unforeseen
circumstance
carried
him
far
away
lord
ruthven
while
on
an
embassy
to
the
hebrides
fell
as
his
disorder
was
attended
with
extreme
danger
he
sent
for
his
wife
and
edwin
impelled
by
love
for
his
father
and
anxiety
to
soothe
the
terrified
suspense
of
his
mother
readily
left
the
side
of
his
friend
to
accompany
her
to
the
isles
lady
mar
had
now
no
scrutinizing
eye
to
fear
her
nephew
murray
was
still
on
duty
in
clydesdale
the
earl
her
husband
trusted
her
too
implicitly
even
to
turn
on
her
a
suspicious
look
and
helen
she
contrived
should
be
as
little
in
her
presence
as
possible
busy
then
as
this
lady
was
the
enemies
of
the
regent
were
not
less
active
in
the
prosecution
of
their
plans
the
earl
of
march
had
arrived
at
dunbar
and
having
dispatched
his
treasonable
proposals
to
edward
had
received
letters
from
that
monarch
by
sea
accepting
his
services
and
promising
every
reward
that
could
satisfy
his
ambition
and
the
cupidity
of
those
whom
he
could
draw
over
to
his
cause
the
wary
king
then
told
the
earl
that
if
he
would
send
his
wife
and
family
to
london
as
hostages
for
his
faith
he
was
ready
to
bring
a
mighty
army
to
dunbar
and
by
that
gate
once
more
enter
scotland
these
negotiations
backward
and
forward
from
london
to
dunbar
and
from
dunbar
to
the
treacherous
lords
at
stirling
occupied
much
time
and
the
more
as
great
precaution
was
necessary
to
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
wallace
which
seemed
to
be
present
in
every
part
of
the
kingdom
at
once
so
careful
was
he
in
overlooking
by
his
officers
civil
and
military
every
transaction
that
the
slightest
dereliction
from
the
straight
order
of
things
was
immediately
seen
and
examined
into
many
of
these
trusty
magistrates
having
been
placed
in
the
lothians
before
march
took
the
government
he
could
not
now
remove
them
without
exciting
suspicion
and
therefore
as
they
remained
great
circumspection
was
used
to
elude
their
watchfulness
from
the
time
that
edward
had
again
entered
into
terms
with
the
scottish
chiefs
lord
march
sent
regular
tidings
to
lord
soulis
of
the
progress
of
their
negotiations
he
knew
that
nobleman
would
gladly
welcome
the
recall
of
the
king
of
england
for
ever
since
the
revolution
in
favor
of
scotland
he
had
remained
obstinately
shut
up
within
his
castle
of
hermitage
chagrin
at
having
lost
helen
was
not
the
least
of
his
mortifications
and
the
wounds
he
had
received
from
the
invisible
hand
which
had
released
her
having
been
given
with
all
the
might
of
the
valiant
arm
which
directed
the
blow
were
not
even
now
healed
his
passions
kept
them
still
inflamed
and
their
smart
made
his
vengeance
burn
the
fiercer
against
wallace
who
he
now
learned
was
the
mysterious
agent
of
her
rescue
while
treason
secretly
prepared
to
spring
its
mine
beneath
the
feet
of
the
regent
he
unsuspicious
that
any
could
be
discontented
where
all
were
free
and
prosperous
thought
of
no
enemy
to
the
tranquil
fulfillment
of
his
duties
but
the
minor
persecutions
of
lady
mar
no
day
escaped
without
bringing
him
letters
either
to
invite
him
to
snawdoun
or
to
lead
her
to
the
citadel
where
he
resided
in
every
one
of
these
epistles
she
declared
that
it
was
no
longer
the
wildness
of
passion
which
impelled
her
to
seek
his
society
but
the
moderated
regard
of
a
friend
and
though
perfectly
aware
of
all
that
was
behind
these
asseverations
for
she
had
deceived
him
once
into
a
belief
of
this
please
and
had
made
him
feel
its
falseness
he
found
himself
forced
at
times
out
of
the
civility
due
to
her
sex
to
comply
with
her
invitations
indeed
her
conduct
never
gave
him
reason
to
hold
her
in
any
higher
respect
for
whenever
they
happened
to
be
left
alone
she
made
pretensions
the
frequency
of
these
scenes
at
last
made
him
never
go
to
snawdoun
unaccompanied
for
she
rarely
allowed
him
to
have
even
a
glimpse
of
helen
and
by
this
precaution
he
avoided
much
of
her
solicitations
but
strange
to
say
even
at
the
time
that
this
conduct
by
driving
her
to
despair
might
have
excited
her
to
some
desperate
act
her
wayward
heart
threw
the
blame
of
his
coldness
upon
her
trammels
with
lord
mar
and
flattering
herself
that
were
he
dead
all
would
happen
as
she
wished
she
panted
for
that
hour
with
an
impatience
which
often
tempted
her
to
precipitate
the
event
things
were
in
this
situation
when
wallace
one
night
received
a
hasty
summons
from
his
pillow
by
a
page
of
lord
mar
requesting
him
to
immediately
repair
to
his
chamber
concluding
that
something
alarming
must
have
happened
he
threw
on
his
brigandine
and
plaid
and
entered
the
apartments
of
the
governor
mar
met
him
with
a
countenance
the
herald
of
a
dreadful
matter
what
has
happened
inquired
wallace
treason
answered
mar
but
from
what
point
i
can
not
guess
my
daughter
has
braved
a
dark
and
lonely
walk
from
snawdoun
to
bring
the
proofs
while
speaking
he
lead
the
chief
into
the
room
where
helen
sat
like
some
fairy
specter
of
the
night
her
long
hair
disordered
by
the
winds
of
a
nocturnal
storm
mingling
with
the
gray
folds
of
the
mantle
which
enveloped
her
wallace
hastened
forward
she
now
no
longer
flitted
away
scared
from
his
approach
by
the
frowning
glances
of
her
he
had
once
attempted
to
express
his
grateful
regrets
for
what
she
had
suffered
in
her
lovely
person
for
his
sake
but
the
countess
had
then
interrupted
him
and
helen
disappeared
now
he
beheld
her
in
a
presence
where
he
could
declare
all
his
gratitude
without
subjecting
its
gentle
object
to
one
harsh
word
in
consequence
and
almost
forgetting
his
errand
to
the
governor
and
the
tidings
he
had
just
heard
he
remembered
only
the
manner
in
which
she
had
shielded
his
life
with
her
arms
and
he
bent
his
knee
respectfully
before
her
as
she
rose
to
his
approach
blushing
and
silent
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
to
rise
he
pressed
it
warmly
sweet
excellence
said
he
i
am
happy
in
this
opportunity
however
gained
to
again
pour
out
my
acknowledgments
to
you
and
though
i
have
been
denied
that
pleasure
until
now
yet
the
memory
of
your
generous
interest
in
the
friend
of
your
father
is
one
of
the
most
cherished
sentiments
of
my
heart
it
is
my
happiness
as
well
as
my
duty
sit
william
wallace
replied
she
to
regard
you
and
my
country
as
one
and
that
i
hope
will
excuse
the
perhaps
rash
action
of
this
night
as
she
spoke
he
rose
and
looked
at
lord
mar
for
explanation
the
earl
held
a
roll
of
vellum
toward
him
this
writing
said
he
was
found
this
evening
by
my
daughter
she
was
enjoying
with
my
wife
and
other
ladies
a
moonlight
walk
on
the
shores
of
the
forth
behind
the
palace
when
having
strayed
at
some
distance
from
her
friends
she
saw
this
packet
lying
in
the
path
before
her
as
if
it
had
just
been
dropped
it
bore
no
direction
she
therefore
opened
it
and
part
of
the
contents
soon
told
her
she
must
conceal
the
whole
till
she
could
reveal
them
to
me
not
even
to
my
wife
did
she
intrust
the
dangerous
secret
nor
would
she
run
any
risk
by
sending
it
by
a
messenger
as
soon
as
the
family
were
gone
to
rest
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
plaid
and
finding
a
passage
through
one
of
the
low
embrasures
of
snawdoun
with
a
fleet
step
made
her
way
to
the
citadel
and
to
me
she
gave
me
the
packet
read
it
my
friend
and
judge
if
we
do
not
owe
ourselves
to
heaven
for
so
critical
a
discovery
wallace
took
the
scroll
and
read
as
follows
our
trusty
fellows
will
bring
you
this
and
deliver
copies
of
the
same
to
the
rest
we
shall
be
with
you
in
hours
after
it
arrives
the
army
of
our
liege
lord
is
now
in
the
lothians
passing
through
them
under
the
appellation
of
succors
for
the
regent
from
the
hebrides
keep
all
safe
and
neither
himself
nor
any
of
his
adherents
shall
have
a
head
on
their
shoulders
by
this
day
week
neither
superscription
name
nor
date
was
to
this
letter
but
wallace
immediately
knew
the
handwriting
to
be
that
of
lord
march
then
we
must
have
traitors
even
within
these
walls
exclaimed
mar
none
but
the
most
powerful
chiefs
would
the
proud
cospatrick
admit
into
his
conspiracies
and
what
are
we
to
do
for
by
evening
the
army
this
traitor
has
let
into
the
heart
of
this
country
will
be
at
our
gates
no
cried
wallace
thanks
to
god
and
this
guardian
angel
fervently
clasping
helen
hand
as
he
spoke
we
must
not
be
intimidated
by
treachery
let
us
be
faithful
to
ourselves
my
veteran
friend
and
all
will
go
well
it
matters
not
who
the
other
traitors
are
they
must
soon
discover
themselves
and
shall
find
us
prepared
to
counteract
their
machinations
sound
your
bugles
my
lord
to
summon
the
heads
of
our
council
at
this
command
helen
arose
but
replaced
herself
in
her
chair
on
wallace
exclaiming
stay
lady
helen
let
the
sight
of
such
virgin
delicacy
braving
the
terrors
of
the
night
to
warn
betrayed
scotland
nerve
every
heart
with
redoubled
courage
to
breast
this
insidious
foe
helen
did
indeed
feel
her
soul
awake
to
all
its
ancient
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
thus
with
a
countenance
pale
but
resplendent
with
the
light
of
her
thoughts
she
sat
the
angel
of
her
heroic
inspiration
wallace
often
turned
to
look
on
her
while
her
eyes
unconscious
of
the
adoring
admiration
which
spoke
in
their
beams
followed
his
godlike
figure
as
it
moved
through
the
room
with
a
step
that
declared
the
undisturbed
determination
of
his
soul
the
lords
bothwell
and
badenoch
were
the
first
that
obeyed
the
call
they
started
at
sight
of
helen
but
wallace
in
a
few
words
related
the
cause
of
her
appearance
and
the
portentous
letter
was
laid
before
them
all
were
acquainted
with
the
handwriting
of
lord
march
and
all
agreed
in
attributing
to
its
real
motive
his
late
solicitude
to
obtain
the
command
of
the
lothians
what
cried
bothwell
but
to
open
his
castle
gates
to
the
enemy
and
to
repel
him
before
he
reaches
ours
my
brave
chiefs
replied
wallace
i
have
summoned
you
edward
will
not
make
this
attempt
without
tremendous
powers
he
knows
what
he
risks
his
men
his
life
and
his
honor
we
must
therefore
expect
a
resolution
in
him
adequate
to
such
an
enterprise
lose
not
then
a
moment
even
this
instant
and
go
out
and
bring
in
your
followers
i
will
call
up
mine
from
the
banks
of
the
clyde
and
be
ready
to
meet
him
ere
he
crosses
the
carrou
while
he
gave
these
orders
other
nobles
thronged
in
and
helen
being
severally
thanked
by
them
all
became
so
agitated
that
stretching
out
her
hand
to
wallace
who
was
nearest
to
her
she
softly
whispered
take
me
hence
he
read
in
her
blushing
face
the
oppression
her
modesty
sustained
in
such
a
scene
and
with
her
faltering
steps
she
leaned
upon
his
arm
as
he
conducted
her
to
an
interior
chamber
overcome
by
her
former
fears
and
the
emotions
of
the
last
hour
she
sunk
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
wallace
stood
near
her
and
as
he
looked
on
her
he
thought
if
aught
on
earth
ever
resembled
the
beloved
of
my
soul
it
is
helen
mar
and
all
the
tenderness
which
memory
gave
to
his
almost
adored
wife
and
all
the
grateful
complacency
with
which
he
regarded
helen
beamed
at
once
from
his
eyes
she
raised
her
head
she
felt
that
look
it
thrilled
to
her
soul
for
a
moment
every
former
thought
seemed
lost
in
the
one
perception
that
he
then
gazed
on
her
as
he
had
never
looked
on
any
woman
since
his
marion
was
she
then
beloved
the
impression
was
evanescent
no
no
said
she
to
herself
and
waving
her
hand
gently
to
him
with
her
head
bent
down
leave
me
sir
william
wallace
forgive
me
but
i
am
exhausted
my
frame
is
weaker
than
my
mind
she
spoke
this
at
intervals
and
wallace
respectfully
touching
the
hand
she
extended
pressed
it
to
his
breast
i
obey
you
dear
lady
helen
and
when
next
we
meet
it
will
i
hope
be
to
dispel
every
fear
in
that
gentle
bosom
she
bowed
her
head
without
looking
up
and
wallace
left
the
room
chapter
liii
falkirk
before
the
sun
rose
every
brave
scot
within
a
few
hours
march
of
stirling
was
on
the
carse
and
lord
andrew
murray
and
his
veteran
clydesdale
men
were
already
resting
on
their
arms
in
view
of
the
city
walls
the
messengers
of
wallace
had
hastened
with
the
speed
of
the
winds
east
and
west
and
the
noon
of
the
day
saw
him
at
the
head
of
thirty
thousand
men
determined
to
fight
or
to
die
for
their
country
the
surrounding
landscape
shone
in
the
brightness
of
midsummer
for
it
was
the
eve
of
magdalen
and
sky
and
earth
bore
witness
to
the
luxuriant
month
of
july
the
heavens
were
clear
the
waters
of
the
forth
danced
in
the
sunbeams
and
the
green
of
the
extended
plain
stretched
its
beautiful
borders
to
the
deepening
woods
all
nature
smiled
all
seemed
in
harmony
and
peace
but
the
breast
of
man
he
who
was
made
lord
of
this
paradise
awoke
to
disturb
its
repose
to
disfigure
its
loveliness
as
the
thronging
legions
poured
upon
the
plain
the
sheep
which
had
been
feeding
there
fled
scared
to
the
hills
the
plover
and
which
nestled
in
the
brakes
rose
affrighted
from
their
infant
broods
and
flew
in
screaming
multitudes
far
over
the
receding
valleys
the
peace
of
scotland
was
again
broken
and
its
flocks
and
herds
were
to
share
its
misery
when
the
conspiring
lords
appeared
on
the
carse
and
mar
communicated
to
them
the
lately
discovered
treason
they
so
well
affected
surprise
at
the
contents
of
the
scroll
that
wallace
might
not
have
suspected
their
connection
with
it
had
not
lord
athol
declared
it
altogether
a
forgery
of
some
wanton
persons
and
then
added
with
bitterness
to
gather
an
army
on
such
authority
is
ridiculous
while
he
spoke
wallace
regarded
him
with
a
look
which
pierced
him
to
the
center
and
the
blood
rushing
into
his
guilty
heart
for
once
in
his
life
he
trembled
before
the
eye
of
man
whoever
be
the
degenerate
scot
to
whom
this
writing
is
addressed
said
wallace
his
baseness
can
not
betray
us
further
the
troops
of
scotland
are
ready
to
meet
the
enemy
and
woe
to
the
man
who
that
day
deserts
his
country
amen
cried
lord
mar
amen
sounded
from
every
lip
for
when
the
conscience
embraces
treason
against
its
earthly
rulers
allegiance
to
its
heavenly
king
is
abandoned
with
ease
and
the
words
and
oaths
of
the
traitor
are
equally
unstable
badenoch
eye
followed
that
of
wallace
and
his
suspicions
fixed
where
the
regent
fell
for
the
honor
of
his
blood
he
forbore
to
accuse
the
earl
but
for
the
same
reason
he
determined
to
watch
his
proceedings
however
the
hypocrisy
of
athol
baffled
even
the
penetration
of
his
brother
and
on
his
retiring
from
the
ground
to
call
forth
his
men
for
the
expedition
in
an
affected
chafe
he
complained
to
badenoch
of
the
stigma
cast
upon
their
house
by
the
regent
implied
charge
but
said
he
he
shall
see
the
honor
of
the
cummin
emblazoned
in
blood
on
the
sands
of
the
forth
his
towering
pride
heeds
not
where
it
strikes
and
this
comes
of
raising
men
of
low
estate
to
rule
over
princes
his
birth
is
noble
if
not
royal
replied
badenoch
and
before
this
the
posterity
of
kings
have
not
disdained
to
recover
their
rights
by
the
sword
of
a
brave
subject
true
answered
athol
but
is
it
customary
for
princes
to
allow
that
subject
to
sit
on
their
throne
it
is
nonsense
to
talk
of
wallace
having
refused
a
coronation
he
laughs
at
the
name
but
see
you
not
that
he
openly
affects
supreme
power
that
he
rules
the
nobles
of
the
land
like
a
despot
his
word
his
nod
is
sufficient
go
here
go
there
as
if
he
were
absolute
and
there
was
no
voice
in
scotland
but
his
own
look
at
the
brave
mack
callan
more
the
lord
of
the
west
of
scotland
from
sea
to
sea
he
stands
unbonneted
before
this
mighty
wallace
with
a
more
abject
homage
than
ever
he
paid
to
the
house
of
alexander
can
you
behold
this
lord
badenoch
and
not
find
the
royal
blood
of
your
descent
boil
in
your
veins
does
not
every
look
of
your
wife
the
sister
of
a
king
and
your
own
right
stamped
upon
your
soul
reproach
you
he
is
greater
by
your
strength
humble
him
my
brother
be
faithful
to
scotland
but
humble
its
proud
dictator
lord
badenoch
replied
to
this
rough
exhortation
with
the
tranquillity
belonging
to
his
nature
i
see
not
the
least
foundations
for
any
of
your
charges
against
sir
william
wallace
he
has
delivered
scotland
and
the
people
are
grateful
the
nation
with
one
voice
made
him
their
regent
and
he
fulfills
the
duties
of
his
office
but
with
a
modesty
lord
athol
which
i
must
affirm
i
never
saw
equaled
i
dissent
from
you
in
all
that
you
have
said
and
i
confess
i
did
fear
the
blandishing
arguments
of
the
faithless
cospatrick
had
persuaded
you
to
embrace
his
pernicious
treason
you
deny
it
that
is
well
prove
your
innocence
at
this
juncture
in
the
field
against
scotland
enemies
and
john
of
badenoch
will
then
see
no
impending
cloud
to
darken
the
honor
of
the
name
of
cummin
the
brothers
immediately
separated
and
athol
calling
his
cousin
buchan
arranged
a
new
device
to
counteract
the
vigilance
of
the
regent
one
of
their
means
was
to
baffle
his
measures
by
stimulating
the
less
treasonable
but
yet
discontented
chiefs
to
thwart
him
in
every
motion
at
the
head
of
this
last
class
was
john
stewart
earl
of
bute
during
the
whole
of
the
preceding
year
he
had
been
in
norway
and
the
first
object
he
met
on
his
return
to
scotland
was
the
triumphal
entry
of
wallace
into
stirling
aware
of
the
consequence
stewart
name
would
attach
to
any
cause
athol
had
gained
his
ear
before
he
was
introduced
to
the
regent
and
then
so
poisoned
his
mind
against
wallace
that
all
that
was
well
in
him
he
deemed
ill
and
ever
spoke
of
his
bravery
with
coldness
and
of
his
patriotism
with
disgust
he
believed
him
a
hypocrite
and
as
such
despised
and
abhorred
him
while
athol
marshaled
his
rebellious
ranks
some
to
follow
his
broad
treason
in
the
face
of
day
and
others
to
lurk
behind
and
delude
the
intrusted
council
left
in
stirling
wallace
led
forth
his
loyal
chiefs
to
take
their
stations
at
the
heads
of
their
different
clans
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
with
the
proudest
expectations
for
scotland
unfurled
his
golden
standard
to
the
sun
the
lords
and
bothwell
with
others
rode
on
the
right
of
the
regent
lord
andrew
murray
with
the
brave
sir
john
graham
and
a
bevy
of
young
knights
kept
the
ground
on
his
left
wallace
looked
around
edwin
was
far
away
and
he
felt
but
half
appointed
when
wanting
his
youthful
swordbearer
that
faithful
friend
did
not
even
know
of
the
threatened
hostility
for
to
have
intimated
to
lord
ruthven
a
danger
he
could
not
assist
to
repel
would
have
inflamed
his
disorder
by
anxiety
and
perhaps
hurried
him
to
dissolution
as
the
regent
moved
forward
with
these
private
affections
checkering
his
public
cares
his
heralds
blew
the
trumpets
of
his
approach
and
a
hundred
embattled
clans
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
awaiting
their
valiant
leaders
each
chief
advanced
to
the
head
of
his
line
and
stood
to
hear
the
charge
of
wallace
brave
scots
cried
he
treachery
has
admitted
the
enemy
whom
resolute
patriotism
had
driven
from
our
borders
be
steady
in
your
fidelity
to
scotland
and
he
who
hath
hitherto
protected
the
just
cause
will
nerve
your
arms
to
lay
invasion
and
its
base
coadjutors
again
in
the
dust
the
cheers
of
anticipated
victory
burst
from
the
soldiers
mingled
with
the
clangor
of
their
striking
shields
at
the
inspiring
voice
of
their
leader
wallace
waved
his
truncheon
round
which
the
plan
of
his
array
was
wrapped
to
the
chiefs
to
fall
back
toward
their
legions
and
while
some
appeared
to
linger
athol
armed
and
spurring
his
roan
into
the
area
before
the
regent
demanded
in
a
haughty
tone
which
of
the
chiefs
now
in
the
field
is
to
lead
the
vanguard
the
regent
of
scotland
replied
wallace
for
once
asserting
the
majesty
of
his
station
and
you
lord
athol
with
the
lord
buchan
are
to
defend
your
country
under
the
command
of
the
brave
head
of
your
house
the
princely
badenoch
i
stir
not
from
this
spot
returned
athol
fiercely
striking
his
lance
into
its
rest
till
i
see
the
honor
of
my
country
established
in
the
eye
of
the
world
by
a
leader
worthy
of
her
rank
being
placed
in
her
vanguard
what
he
says
cried
buchan
i
second
and
in
the
same
spirit
chieftain
of
ellerslie
exclaimed
lord
bute
do
i
offer
to
scotland
myself
and
my
people
another
must
lead
the
van
or
i
retire
from
her
standard
speak
on
cried
wallace
more
surprised
than
confounded
by
this
extraordinary
attack
what
these
illustrious
chiefs
have
uttered
is
the
voice
of
us
all
was
the
general
exclamation
from
a
band
of
warriors
who
now
thronged
around
the
incendiary
nobles
your
reign
is
over
proud
chieftain
rejoined
athol
the
scottish
ranks
are
no
longer
to
be
cajoled
by
your
affected
moderation
we
see
the
tyrant
in
your
insidious
smile
we
feel
him
in
the
despotism
of
your
decrees
to
be
thus
ridden
by
a
man
of
vulgar
blood
to
present
him
as
the
head
of
our
nation
to
the
king
of
england
is
beneath
the
dignity
of
our
country
is
an
insult
to
our
nobles
and
therefore
in
the
power
of
her
consequence
i
speak
and
again
demand
of
you
to
yield
the
vanguard
to
one
more
worthy
of
the
station
before
god
and
magdalen
i
swear
added
he
holding
up
his
sword
to
the
heavens
i
will
not
stir
an
inch
this
day
toward
the
enemy
unless
a
cummin
or
a
stewart
lead
our
army
and
is
this
your
resolution
also
lord
bute
said
wallace
looking
on
stewart
it
is
was
the
reply
a
foe
like
edward
ought
to
be
met
as
becomes
a
great
and
independent
kingdom
we
go
in
the
array
of
an
unanimous
nation
to
repel
him
not
as
a
band
of
insurgents
headed
by
a
general
who
however
brave
was
yet
drawn
from
the
common
ranks
of
the
people
i
therefore
demand
to
follow
a
more
illustrious
leader
to
the
field
the
eagles
have
long
enough
followed
their
owl
in
peacock
feathers
cried
buchan
and
being
tired
of
the
game
i
like
the
rest
soar
upward
again
resign
that
baton
cried
athol
give
peace
to
a
more
honorable
leader
repeated
he
supposed
that
he
had
intimidated
wallace
but
wallace
raising
the
visor
of
his
helmet
which
he
had
closed
on
his
last
commands
to
his
generals
looked
on
athol
with
all
the
majesty
of
his
truly
royal
soul
in
his
eyes
earl
said
he
the
voices
of
the
three
estates
of
scotland
declared
me
their
regent
and
god
ratified
the
election
by
the
victories
with
which
he
crowned
me
if
in
aught
i
have
betrayed
my
trust
led
the
powers
which
raised
me
be
my
accusers
four
pitched
battles
have
i
fought
and
gained
for
this
country
twice
i
beat
the
representatives
of
king
edward
on
the
plains
of
scotland
and
a
few
months
ago
i
made
him
fly
before
me
over
the
fields
of
northumberland
what
then
has
befallen
me
that
my
arm
is
to
be
too
short
to
meet
this
man
has
the
oil
of
the
lord
with
which
the
saint
of
dunkeld
anointed
my
brows
lost
its
virtue
that
i
should
shrink
before
any
king
in
christendom
i
neither
tremble
at
the
name
of
edward
nor
will
i
so
disgrace
my
own
which
never
man
who
bore
it
ever
degraded
by
swearing
fealty
to
a
foreign
prince
as
to
abandon
at
such
a
crisis
the
power
with
which
scotland
has
invested
me
whoever
chooses
to
leave
the
cause
of
their
country
let
them
go
and
so
manifest
themselves
of
noble
blood
i
remain
and
i
lead
the
vanguard
scotsmen
to
your
duty
as
he
spoke
with
a
voice
of
unanswerable
command
several
chiefs
fell
back
into
their
ranks
but
some
made
a
retrograde
motion
toward
the
town
lord
bute
hardly
knew
what
to
think
so
was
he
startled
by
the
appeal
of
the
accused
regent
and
the
noble
frankness
with
which
he
maintained
his
rights
he
stood
frowning
as
wallace
turned
to
him
and
said
do
you
my
lord
adhere
to
these
violent
men
or
am
i
to
consider
a
chief
who
though
hostile
to
me
was
generous
in
his
ire
still
faithful
to
scotland
in
spite
of
his
prejudice
against
her
leader
will
you
fight
her
battles
i
shall
never
desert
them
replied
stewart
is
truth
i
seek
therefore
be
it
to
you
wallace
this
day
according
to
your
conscience
wallace
bowed
his
head
and
presented
him
the
truncheon
around
which
his
line
of
battle
was
wrapped
on
opening
it
he
found
that
he
was
appointed
to
command
the
third
division
badenoch
and
bothwell
to
the
first
and
second
and
wallace
himself
to
the
vanguard
when
the
scouts
arrived
they
informed
the
regent
that
the
english
army
had
advanced
near
to
the
boundary
of
linlithgow
and
from
the
rapidity
of
their
march
must
be
on
the
carron
the
same
evening
on
this
intelligence
wallace
put
his
troops
to
their
speed
and
before
the
sun
had
declined
far
toward
the
west
he
was
within
view
of
falkirk
but
just
as
he
had
crossed
the
carron
and
the
southron
banners
appeared
in
sight
lord
athol
at
the
head
of
his
rebellious
colleagues
rode
up
to
him
stewart
kept
his
appointed
station
and
badenoch
doing
the
same
ashamed
of
his
brother
disorder
called
after
him
to
keep
his
line
regardless
of
all
check
the
obstinate
chief
galloped
on
and
extending
his
bold
accomplices
across
the
path
of
the
regent
demanded
of
him
on
the
penalty
of
his
life
that
moment
to
relinquish
his
pretensions
to
the
vanguard
i
am
not
come
here
replied
wallace
indignantly
to
betray
my
country
i
know
you
lord
athol
and
your
conduct
and
mine
will
this
day
prove
who
is
most
worthy
the
confidence
of
scotland
this
day
cried
athol
shall
see
you
lay
down
the
power
you
have
usurped
it
shall
see
me
maintain
it
to
your
confusion
replied
wallace
and
were
you
not
surrounded
by
scots
of
too
tried
a
worth
for
me
to
suspect
their
being
influenced
by
your
rebellious
example
i
would
this
moment
make
you
feel
the
arm
of
justice
but
the
foe
is
in
sight
do
your
duty
now
sir
earl
and
for
the
sake
of
the
house
to
which
you
belong
even
this
intemperate
conduct
shall
be
forgotten
at
this
instant
sir
john
graham
hastening
forward
exclaimed
the
southrons
are
bearing
down
upon
us
athol
glanced
at
their
distant
host
and
turning
on
wallace
with
a
sarcastic
smile
my
actions
cried
he
shall
indeed
decide
the
day
and
striking
his
spurs
furiously
into
his
horse
he
rejoined
lord
badenoch
legion
edward
did
indeed
advance
in
a
most
terrible
array
above
a
hundred
thousand
men
swelled
his
numerous
ranks
and
with
these
were
united
all
from
the
lothians
and
teviotdale
whom
the
influence
of
the
faithless
march
and
the
vindictive
soulis
could
bring
into
the
field
with
this
augmented
host
and
a
determination
to
conquer
or
to
die
the
southrons
marched
rapidly
forward
wallace
had
drawn
himself
up
on
the
ascent
of
the
hill
of
falkirk
and
advantageously
planted
his
archers
on
a
covering
eminence
flanked
by
the
legions
of
badenoch
lord
athol
who
knew
the
integrity
of
his
brother
and
who
cared
not
in
so
great
a
cause
for
such
his
ambition
termed
it
how
he
removed
an
adversary
from
edward
and
a
censor
from
himself
gave
a
ridding
order
to
one
of
his
emissaries
accordingly
in
the
moment
when
the
trumpet
of
wallace
sounded
the
charge
and
the
arrows
from
the
hill
darkened
the
air
the
virtuous
badenoch
was
stabbed
through
the
back
to
the
very
heart
athol
had
placed
himself
near
to
watch
his
purpose
but
in
the
instant
the
deed
was
done
he
threw
himself
on
the
perpetrator
and
wounding
him
in
the
same
vital
part
exclaimed
holding
up
his
dagger
behold
the
weapon
that
has
slain
the
assassin
hired
by
sir
william
wallace
thus
it
is
that
his
ambition
would
rob
scotland
of
her
native
princes
let
us
fly
from
his
steel
to
the
shield
of
a
king
and
a
hero
the
men
had
seen
their
leader
fall
they
doubted
not
the
words
of
his
brother
and
with
a
shout
exclaiming
whither
you
lead
we
follow
all
at
once
turned
toward
him
seize
the
traitor
artillery
at
this
command
they
mounted
the
hill
and
the
archers
little
expecting
an
assault
from
their
countrymen
were
either
instantly
cut
down
or
hurried
away
prisoners
by
athol
and
buchan
who
now
at
the
head
of
the
whole
division
of
the
cummins
galloped
toward
the
southrons
and
with
loud
cries
of
long
live
king
edward
threw
themselves
en
masse
into
their
arms
the
squadrons
which
followed
stewart
not
knowing
but
they
might
be
hurried
into
similar
desertion
hesitated
in
the
charge
he
had
commanded
them
to
make
and
while
thus
undecisive
some
obeyed
in
broken
ranks
and
others
lingered
the
enemy
advanced
briskly
up
surrounded
the
division
and
on
their
first
onset
slew
its
leader
his
faithful
brandanes
seeing
their
beloved
commander
trampled
to
the
earth
by
an
overwhelming
foe
fell
into
confusion
and
communicating
their
dismay
to
their
comrades
the
whole
division
sunk
under
the
shock
of
the
southrons
as
if
touched
by
a
spell
was
the
distinguished
appellation
of
the
military
followers
of
the
chiefs
of
bute
meanwhile
bothwell
and
his
legions
were
fiercely
engaged
with
the
earl
of
lincoln
amid
the
swamps
of
a
deep
morass
but
being
involved
by
reciprocal
impetuousity
equal
peril
engulfed
them
both
the
firm
battalion
of
the
vanguard
alone
remaining
unbroken
stood
before
the
pressing
and
now
victorious
thousands
of
edward
without
receding
a
step
the
archers
being
lost
by
the
treachery
of
the
cummins
all
hope
lay
on
the
strength
of
the
spear
and
sword
and
wallace
standing
immovable
as
the
rock
of
stirling
saw
rank
after
rank
of
his
dauntless
infantry
mowed
down
by
the
southron
arrows
while
fast
as
they
fell
their
comrades
closed
over
them
and
still
presented
the
same
impenetrable
front
of
steady
valor
against
the
heavy
charges
of
the
enemy
horse
the
king
of
england
indignant
at
this
pause
in
his
conquering
onset
accompanied
by
his
natural
brother

valiant
frere
de
briagny
and
a
squadron
of
resolute
knights
in
fury
threw
themselves
toward
the
scottish
pikesmen
wallace
descried
the
jeweled
crest
of
edward
amidst
the
cloud
of
battle
there
and
rushing
forward
hand
to
hand
engaged
the
king
edward
knew
his
adversary
not
so
much
by
his
snow
white
plume
as
by
the
prowess
of
his
arm
twice
did
the
heavy
claymore
of
wallace
strike
fire
from
the
steely
helmet
of
the
monarch
but
at
the
third
stroke
the
glittering
diadem
fell
in
shivers
to
the
ground
and
the
royal
blood
of
edward
followed
the
blow
he
reeled
and
another
stroke
would
have
settled
the
freedom
of
scotland
forever
had
not
the
strong
arm
of
frere
de
briagny
passed
between
wallace
and
the
king
the
combat
thickened
blow
followed
blow
blood
gushed
at
each
fall
of
the
sword
and
the
hacked
armor
showed
in
every
aperture
a
grisly
wound
a
hundred
weapons
seemed
directed
against
the
breast
of
the
regent
of
scotland
when
raising
his
sword
with
a
determined
stroke
it
cleft
the
visor
and
vest
of
de
briagny
who
fell
lifeless
to
the
ground
the
cry
that
issued
from
the
southron
troops
at
this
sight
again
nerved
the
vengeful
edward
and
ordering
the
signal
for
his
reserve
to
advance
he
renewed
the
attack
and
assaulting
wallace
with
all
the
fury
of
his
heart
in
his
eyes
and
arms
he
tore
the
earth
with
the
trampling
of
disappointed
vengeance
when
he
found
the
invincible
phalanx
still
stood
firm
i
will
reach
him
yet
cried
he
and
turning
to
de
valence
he
commanded
that
the
new
artillery
should
be
called
into
action
on
this
order
a
blast
of
trumpets
in
the
southron
army
blew
and
the
answering
it
had
summoned
sent
forth
showers
of
stones
into
the
midst
of
the
scottish
battalions
at
the
same
moment
the
english
reserve
charging
round
the
hill
attacked
them
in
the
flank
and
accomplished
what
the
fiery
torrent
had
begun
the
field
was
heaped
with
dead
the
brooks
which
flowed
down
the
heights
ran
with
blood
but
no
confusion
was
there
no
not
even
in
the
mind
of
wallace
though
with
amazement
and
horror
he
beheld
the
saltire
of
annandale
the
banner
of
bruce
leading
onward
the
last
exterminating
division
scot
now
contended
with
scot
brother
with
brother
those
valiant
spirits
who
had
left
their
country
twenty
years
before
to
accompany
their
chief
to
the
holy
land
now
scotland
to
wound
her
in
her
vital
part
to
wrest
from
her
her
liberties
to
make
her
mourn
in
ashes
that
she
had
been
the
mother
of
such
matricides
a
horrid
mingling
of
tartans
with
tartans
in
the
direful
grasp
of
reciprocal
death
a
tremendous
rushing
of
the
flaming
artillery
which
swept
the
scottish
ranks
like
blasting
lightning
for
a
moment
seemed
to
make
the
reason
of
their
leader
stagger
arrows
winged
with
fire
flashed
through
the
air
and
sticking
in
men
and
beasts
drove
them
against
each
other
in
maddening
pain
twice
was
the
horse
of
wallace
shot
under
him
and
on
every
side
were
his
closest
friends
wounded
and
dispersed
but
his
terrific
horror
at
the
scene
passed
away
the
moment
of
its
perception
and
though
the
southron
and
the
bruce
pressed
on
him
in
overwhelming
numbers
his
few
remaining
ranks
obeyed
his
call
and
with
a
presence
of
mind
and
military
skill
that
was
exhaustless
he
maintained
the
fight
till
darkness
parted
the
combatants
when
edward
gave
command
for
his
troops
to
rest
till
morning
wallace
with
the
remnant
of
his
faithful
band
slowly
recrossed
the
carron
that
they
also
might
repose
till
dawn
should
renew
the
conflict
lonely
was
the
sound
of
his
bugle
as
sitting
on
a
fragment
of
the
druidical
ruins
of
dunipacis
he
blew
its
melancholy
blast
to
summon
his
chiefs
around
him
its
penetrating
voice
pierced
the
hills
but
no
answering
note
came
upon
his
ear
a
direful
conviction
seized
upon
his
heart
but
they
might
have
fled
far
distant
he
blushed
as
the
thought
crossed
him
and
hopeless
again
dropped
the
horn
which
he
had
raised
to
blow
a
second
summons
at
this
instant
he
saw
a
shadow
darken
the
moonlight
ruins
and
scrymgeour
who
had
gladly
heard
his
bugle
hastened
forward
what
has
been
the
fate
of
this
dismal
day
asked
wallace
looking
onward
as
if
he
expected
others
to
come
up
where
are
my
friends
where
graham
badenoch
and
bothwell
where
all
brave
scrymgeour
that
i
do
not
know
see
he
rose
from
his
seat
at
sight
of
an
advancing
group
it
approached
near
and
laid
the
dead
body
of
a
warrior
down
before
him
thus
cried
one
of
the
supporters
in
stifled
sounds
has
my
father
proved
his
love
for
scotland
it
was
murray
who
spoke
it
was
the
earl
of
bothwell
that
lay
a
breathless
corpse
at
his
feet
grievous
has
been
the
havoc
of
scot
on
scot
cried
the
intrepid
graham
who
had
seconded
the
arm
of
murray
in
the
contest
for
his
father
body
your
steadiness
sir
william
wallace
would
have
retrieved
the
day
but
for
the
murderer
of
his
country
that
bruce
for
whom
you
refused
to
be
our
king
thus
destroys
her
bravest
sons
their
blood
be
on
his
head
continued
the
young
chief
extending
his
martial
arms
toward
heaven
power
of
justice
hear
and
let
his
days
be
troubled
and
his
death
covered
with
dishonor
my
brave
friend
replied
wallace
his
deeds
will
avenge
themselves
he
needs
not
further
malediction
let
us
rather
bless
the
remains
of
him
who
is
gone
before
us
thus
in
glory
to
his
heavenly
rest
ah
better
is
it
thus
to
be
laid
in
the
bed
of
honor
than
by
surviving
witness
the
calamities
which
the
double
treason
of
this
day
will
bring
upon
our
martyred
country
murray
my
friend
cried
he
to
lord
andrew
we
must
not
let
the
brave
dead
perish
in
vain
their
monument
shall
yet
be
scotland
liberties
fear
not
that
we
are
forsaken
because
of
these
traitors
but
remember
our
time
is
in
the
hand
of
the
god
of
justice
and
mercy
tears
were
coursing
each
other
in
mute
woe
down
the
cheeks
of
the
affectionate
son
he
could
not
for
some
time
answer
wallace
but
he
grasped
his
hand
and
at
last
rapidly
articulated
others
may
have
fallen
but
not
mortally
like
him
life
may
yet
be
preserved
in
some
of
our
brave
companions
leave
me
then
to
mourn
my
dead
alone
and
seek
ye
them
wallace
saw
that
filial
tenderness
yearned
for
the
moment
when
it
might
unburden
its
grief
unchecked
by
observation
he
arose
and
making
a
sign
to
his
friends
withdrew
toward
his
men
having
sent
a
detachment
to
guard
the
sacred
inclosure
of
dunipacis
he
dispatched
graham
on
the
dangerous
duty
of
gathering
a
reinforcement
for
the
morning
then
sending
scrymgeour
with
a
resolute
band
across
the
carron
to
bring
in
the
wounded
for
edward
had
encamped
his
army
about
a
mile
south
of
the
field
of
action
he
took
his
lonely
course
along
the
northern
bank
toward
a
shallow
ford
near
which
he
supposed
the
squadrons
of
lord
must
have
fought
and
where
he
hoped
to
gain
accounts
of
him
from
some
straggling
survivor
of
his
clan
when
he
arrived
at
a
point
where
the
river
is
narrowest
and
winds
its
dark
stream
beneath
impending
heights
he
blew
the
campbell
pibroch
the
notes
reverberated
from
rock
to
rock
but
unanswered
died
away
in
distant
echoes
still
he
could
not
relinquish
hope
and
pursuing
the
path
emerged
upon
an
open
glade
the
unobstructed
rays
of
the
moon
illumined
every
object
across
the
river
at
some
distance
from
the
bank
a
division
of
the
southron
tents
whitened
the
deep
shadows
of
the
bordering
woods
and
before
them
on
the
plain
he
thought
he
descried
a
solitary
warrior
wallace
stopped
the
man
approached
the
margin
of
the
stream
and
looked
toward
the
scottish
chief
the
visor
of
wallace
being
up
discovered
his
heroic
countenance
bright
in
the
moonbeams
and
the
majesty
of
his
mien
seemed
to
declare
him
to
the
southron
knight
to
be
no
other
than
the
regent
of
scotland
who
art
thou
cried
the
warrior
with
a
voice
of
command
that
better
became
his
lips
than
it
was
adapted
to
the
man
whom
he
addressed
the
enemy
of
england
cried
the
chief
thou
art
wallace
was
the
immediate
reply
none
else
dare
answer
the
lord
of
carrick
and
of
annandale
with
such
haughty
boldness
every
scot
in
this
land
returned
wallace
inflamed
with
an
indignation
he
did
not
attempt
to
repress
would
thus
answer
bruce
not
only
in
reference
to
england
but
to
himself
to
that
bruce
who
not
satisfied
with
having
abandoned
his
people
to
their
enemies
has
stolen
a
base
fratricide
to
slay
his
brethren
in
their
home
to
have
met
them
on
the
plain
of
stanmore
would
have
been
a
deed
his
posterity
might
have
bewailed
but
what
horror
what
shame
will
be
theirs
when
they
know
that
he
came
to
ruin
his
own
rights
to
stab
his
people
in
the
very
bosom
of
his
country
i
come
from
gazing
on
the
murdered
body
of
the
virtuous
earl
of
bothwell
the
lords
bute
and
fyfe
and
perhaps
have
fallen
beneath
the
southron
sword
and
your
unnatural
arm
and
yet
do
you
demand
what
scot
would
dare
to
tell
you
that
he
holds
the
earl
of
carrick
and
his
coadjutors
as
his
most
mortal
foes
ambitious
man
dost
thou
flatter
thyself
with
belief
that
i
am
to
be
deceived
by
thy
pompous
declamation
i
know
the
motive
of
all
this
pretended
patriotism
i
am
well
informed
of
the
aim
of
all
this
vaunted
prowess
and
i
came
not
to
fight
the
battles
of
king
edward
but
to
punish
the
proud
usurper
of
the
rights
of
bruce
i
have
gained
my
point
my
brave
followers
slew
the
lord
of
bothwell
my
brave
followers
made
the
hitherto
invincible
sir
william
wallace
retreat
i
came
in
the
power
of
my
birthright
and
as
your
lawful
king
i
command
you
this
hour
to
lay
your
rebel
sword
at
my
feet
obey
proud
knight
or
puts
you
into
edward
hand
and
without
appeal
you
die
the
death
of
a
traitor
unhappy
prince
cried
wallace
now
suspecting
that
bruce
had
been
deceived
is
it
over
the
necks
of
your
most
loyal
subjects
that
you
would
mount
your
throne
how
have
you
been
mistaken
how
have
you
strengthened
the
hands
of
your
enemy
and
weakened
your
own
by
this
day
action
the
cause
is
now
probably
lost
forever
and
from
whom
are
we
to
date
its
ruin
but
from
him
to
whom
the
nation
looked
as
to
its
appointed
deliverer
from
him
whose
once
honored
name
will
now
be
regarded
with
exaggeration
burden
not
my
name
rash
young
man
replied
bruce
with
the
charges
belonging
to
your
own
mad
ambition
who
disturbed
the
peace
in
which
scotland
reposed
after
the
battle
of
dunbar
but
william
wallace
who
raised
the
country
in
arms
but
william
wallace
who
stole
from
me
my
birthright
and
fastened
the
people
love
on
himself
but
william
wallace
who
affected
to
repel
a
crown
that
he
might
the
more
certainly
fix
it
on
his
head
but
william
wallace
and
who
dares
now
taunt
me
with
his
errors
and
mishaps
but
the
same
traitor
to
his
lawful
sovereign
shall
i
answer
thee
lord
of
carrick
replied
wallace
with
a
similar
appeal
who
when
the
southron
tyrant
preferred
a
false
claim
to
the
supremacy
of
this
realm
subscribed
to
the
falsehood
and
by
that
action
did
all
in
his
power
to
make
a
free
people
slaves
who
when
the
brand
of
cruelty
swept
this
kingdom
from
shore
to
shore
lay
indolent
in
the
usurper
court
and
heard
of
these
oppressions
without
a
sigh
who
horror
on
horror
brought
an
army
into
his
own
inheritance
to
slay
his
brethren
and
to
lay
it
desolate
before
his
mortal
foe
thy
heart
will
tell
thee
bruce
who
is
this
man
and
if
honor
yet
remain
in
that
iron
region
thou
wilt
not
disbelieve
the
asseverations
of
an
honest
scot
who
proclaims
that
it
was
to
save
them
whom
thou
didst
abandon
that
he
appeared
in
the
armies
of
scotland
it
was
to
supply
the
place
of
thy
desertion
that
he
assumed
the
rule
with
which
a
grateful
people
rescued
from
bondage
invested
him
bold
chieftain
exclaimed
bruce
is
it
thus
you
continue
to
brave
your
offended
prince
but
in
pity
to
your
youth
in
admiration
of
a
prowess
which
would
have
been
godlike
had
it
been
exerted
for
your
sovereign
and
not
used
as
a
bait
to
satisfy
an
ambition
wild
as
it
is
towering
i
would
expostulate
with
you
i
would
even
deign
to
tell
you
that
in
granting
the
supremacy
of
edward
the
royal
bruce
submits
not
to
the
mere
wish
of
a
despot
but
to
the
necessity
of
the
times
this
is
not
an
area
of
so
great
loyalty
that
any
sovereign
may
venture
to
contend
against
such
an
imperial
arm
as
edward
and
would
you
a
boy
in
years
a
novice
in
politics
and
though
brave
and
till
this
day
successful
would
you
pretend
to
prolong
a
war
with
the
dictator
of
kingdoms
can
rational
discrimination
be
united
with
the
valor
you
possess
and
you
not
perceive
the
unequal
contest
between
a
weak
state
deprived
of
its
head
and
agitated
by
intestine
commotions
and
a
mighty
nation
conducted
by
the
ablest
and
most
martial
monarch
of
his
age
a
man
who
is
not
only
determined
to
maintain
his
pretensions
to
scotland
but
is
master
of
every
resourse
either
for
protracting
war
or
pushing
it
with
vigor
if
the
love
of
your
country
be
indeed
your
motive
for
perseverance
your
obstinacy
tends
only
to
lengthen
her
misery
but
if
as
i
believe
is
the
case
you
carry
your
views
to
private
aggrandizement
reflect
on
their
probable
issue
should
edward
by
a
miracle
withdraw
his
armies
and
an
intoxicated
people
elevate
their
minion
to
the
throne
the
lords
of
scotland
would
reject
the
bold
invasion
and
with
the
noble
vengeance
of
insulted
greatness
hurl
from
his
height
the
proud
usurper
of
their
rights
and
mine
to
usurp
any
man
rights
and
least
of
all
my
king
replied
wallace
never
came
within
the
range
of
my
thoughts
though
lowly
born
lord
carrick
i
am
not
so
base
as
to
require
assumption
to
give
me
dignity
i
saw
my
country
made
a
garrison
of
edward
i
beheld
its
people
outraged
in
every
relation
that
is
dear
to
man
who
heard
their
cry
where
was
bruce
where
the
nobles
of
scotland
that
none
arose
to
extinguish
her
burning
villages
to
shelter
the
mother
and
the
child
to
rescue
purity
from
violation
to
defend
the
bleeding
father
and
his
son
the
shrieks
of
despair
resounded
through
the
land
and
none
appeared
the
hand
of
violence
fell
on
my
own
house
the
wife
of
my
bosom
was
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
a
magistrate
of
the
usurper
i
then
drew
the
sword
i
took
pity
on
those
who
suffered
as
i
had
suffered
i
espoused
their
cause
and
never
will
i
forsake
it
till
life
forsakes
me
therefore
that
i
became
champion
of
scotland
lord
of
carrick
blame
not
my
ambition
but
rather
the
supineness
of
the
nobility
and
chiefly
yourself
you
who
uniting
personal
merit
to
dignity
of
descent
had
deserted
to
occupy
had
the
scots
from
the
time
of
baliol
abdication
possessed
such
a
leader
as
yourself
for
what
is
the
necessity
of
the
times
but
the
pusillanimity
of
those
who
ought
to
contend
with
edward
by
your
valor
and
their
union
you
must
have
surmounted
every
difficulty
under
which
we
struggle
and
have
closed
the
contest
with
success
and
honor
if
you
now
start
from
your
guilty
delusion
it
may
not
be
too
late
to
rescue
scotland
from
the
perils
which
surround
her
listen
then
to
my
voice
prince
of
the
blood
of
alexander
forswear
the
tyrant
who
has
cajoled
you
to
this
abandonment
of
your
country
and
resolve
to
be
her
deliverer
the
bravest
of
the
scots
are
ready
to
acknowledge
you
their
lord
to
reign
as
your
forefathers
did
untrammeled
by
any
foreign
yoke
exchange
then
a
base
vassalage
for
freedom
and
a
throne
awake
to
yourself
noble
bruce
and
behold
what
it
is
i
propose
heaven
itself
can
not
set
a
more
glorious
prize
before
the
eyes
of
virtue
or
ambition
than
to
join
in
one
object
the
acquisition
of
royalty
with
the
maintenance
of
national
independence
such
is
my
last
appeal
to
you
for
myself
as
i
am
well
convinced
that
the
real
welfare
of
my
country
can
never
subsist
with
the
sacrifice
of
her
liberties
i
am
determined
as
far
as
in
me
lies
to
prolong
not
her
miseries
but
her
integrity
by
preserving
her
from
the
contamination
of
slavery
but
should
mysterious
fate
decree
her
fall
may
that
power
which
knows
the
vice
and
horrors
which
accompany
a
tyrant
reign
terminate
the
existence
of
a
people
who
can
no
longer
preserve
their
lives
but
by
receiving
laws
from
usurpation
the
truth
and
gallantry
of
these
sentiments
struck
the
awakened
mind
of
bruce
with
the
force
of
conviction
another
auditor
was
nigh
who
also
lost
not
a
syllable
and
the
flame
was
conveyed
from
the
breast
of
one
hero
to
that
of
the
other
lord
carrick
secretly
repented
of
all
that
he
had
done
but
being
too
proud
to
acknowledge
so
much
he
briefly
answered
wallace
your
words
have
made
an
impression
on
me
that
may
one
day
still
more
brighten
the
glory
of
your
fame
be
silent
respecting
this
conference
be
faithful
to
the
principles
you
have
declared
and
ere
long
you
shall
hear
royally
of
bruce
as
he
spoke
he
turned
away
and
was
lost
among
the
trees
wallace
stood
for
some
minutes
musing
on
what
had
passed
when
hearing
a
footstep
behind
him
he
turned
round
and
beheld
approaching
him
a
young
and
graceful
form
habited
in
a
white
hacqueton
wrought
in
gold
with
golden
spurs
on
his
feet
and
a
helmet
of
the
same
costly
metal
on
his
head
crested
with
white
feathers
had
the
scene
been
in
palestine
he
might
have
mistaken
him
for
the
host
guardian
angel
in
arms
but
the
moment
the
eyes
of
wallace
fell
on
him
the
stranger
hastened
forward
and
threw
himself
on
one
knee
before
him
with
so
noble
a
grace
that
the
chief
was
lost
in
wonder
what
this
beautiful
apparition
could
mean
the
youth
after
an
agitated
pause
bowing
his
head
exclaimed
pardon
this
intrusion
bravest
of
men
i
come
to
offer
you
my
heart
my
life
to
wash
out
by
your
side
in
the
blood
of
the
enemies
of
scotland
the
stigma
which
now
dishonors
the
name
of
bruce
and
who
are
you
noble
youth
cried
wallace
raising
him
from
the
ground
surely
my
prayers
are
at
last
answered
and
i
hear
these
sentiments
from
one
of
alexander
race
i
am
indeed
of
his
blood
replied
he
and
it
must
now
be
my
study
to
prove
my
descent
by
deeds
worthy
of
my
ancestor
i
am
robert
bruce
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
carrick
and
annandale
grieving
over
the
slaughter
that
his
valor
had
made
of
his
own
people
although
till
you
taught
him
otherwise
he
believed
they
fought
to
maintain
the
usurpation
of
an
ambitious
subject
he
walked
out
in
melancholy
i
followed
at
a
distance
and
i
heard
unseen
all
that
has
passed
between
you
and
him
he
has
retired
to
his
tent
and
unknown
to
him
i
hastened
across
the
carron
to
avow
my
loyalty
to
virtue
to
declare
my
determination
to
live
for
scotland
or
to
die
for
her
and
to
follow
the
arms
of
sir
william
wallace
till
he
plants
my
father
in
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
i
take
you
at
your
word
brave
prince
replied
the
regent
and
this
night
shall
give
you
an
opportunity
to
redeem
to
scotland
what
your
father
sword
has
this
day
wrested
from
her
what
i
mean
to
do
must
be
effected
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
that
done
it
will
be
prudent
for
you
to
return
to
the
carrick
camp
and
there
take
the
most
effectual
means
to
persuade
your
father
to
throw
himself
at
once
into
the
arms
of
scotland
the
whole
nation
will
then
rally
round
their
king
and
as
his
weapon
of
war
i
shall
rejoice
to
fulfill
the
commission
with
which
god
has
intrusted
me
he
then
briefly
unfolded
to
the
eagerly
listening
bruce
whose
aspiring
spirit
inflamed
by
the
fervor
of
youth
and
winged
by
natural
courage
saw
the
glory
alone
of
the
enterprise
an
attack
which
he
meant
to
make
on
the
camp
of
edward
while
his
victorious
troops
slept
in
fancied
security
he
had
sent
sir
john
graham
to
stirling
to
call
out
its
garrison
ker
he
had
dispatched
on
a
similar
errand
and
expecting
that
by
this
time
some
of
the
troops
would
be
arrived
on
the
southern
extremity
of
the
carse
he
threw
his
plaid
over
the
prince
splendid
garb
to
conceal
him
from
notice
then
returning
to
the
few
who
lay
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
he
asked
one
of
the
young
gordons
to
lend
him
his
armor
saying
he
had
use
for
it
and
to
seek
another
suit
in
the
heap
that
had
been
collected
from
the
buried
dead
the
brave
scot
cheerfully
acquiesced
and
wallace
retiring
amongst
the
trees
with
his
royal
companion
bruce
soon
covered
his
gay
hacqueton
with
this
rough
mail
and
placing
the
scottish
bonnet
on
his
head
put
a
large
stone
into
the
golden
helmet
and
sunk
it
in
the
waters
of
the
carron
being
thus
completely
armed
like
one
of
the
youthful
clansmen
in
the
ranks
and
such
disguise
was
necessary
wallace
put
the
trusty
claymore
of
his
country
into
its
prince
hand
and
clasping
him
with
a
hero
warmth
to
his
heart
now
it
is
cried
he
that
william
wallace
lives
anew
since
he
has
seen
this
hour
on
from
the
wood
they
met
sir
john
graham
who
had
just
arrived
with
five
hundred
fugitives
from
lord
bute
slaughtered
division
whom
he
had
rallied
on
the
carse
he
informed
his
friend
that
the
earl
of
mar
was
within
half
a
mile
of
the
carron
with
three
thousand
more
and
that
he
would
soon
be
joined
by
other
to
a
similar
amount
while
graham
yet
spoke
a
squadron
of
armed
men
approached
from
the
forth
side
wallace
advancing
toward
them
beheld
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
in
his
sacerdotal
robes
at
their
head
but
with
a
corselet
on
his
breast
and
instead
of
his
crosier
he
carried
a
drawn
sword
we
come
to
you
champion
of
scotland
cried
the
prelate
with
the
prayers
and
the
arms
of
the
church
the
sword
of
the
levites
of
old
smote
the
enemies
of
israel
and
in
the
same
faith
that
the
god
of
justice
will
go
before
us
this
night
we
come
to
fight
for
scotland
liberties
his
followers
were
the
younger
brethren
of
the
monastery
of
and
others
from
the
neighboring
convents
altogether
making
a
stout
and
legion
with
this
handful
cried
wallace
heaven
may
find
a
david
who
shall
yet
strike
yon
goliath
on
the
forehead
lord
mar
and
lord
lennox
now
came
up
and
wallace
marshaling
his
train
found
that
he
had
nearly
ten
thousand
men
he
gave
to
each
leader
his
plan
of
attack
and
having
placed
bruce
with
graham
in
the
van
before
he
took
his
station
at
its
head
he
retired
to
the
ruins
near
dunipacis
to
visit
the
mourning
solitude
of
murray
he
found
the
pious
son
sitting
silent
and
motionless
by
the
side
of
his
dead
parent
without
rousing
the
violence
of
grief
by
any
reference
to
the
sight
before
him
wallace
briefly
communicated
his
project
lord
andrew
started
to
his
feet
i
will
share
all
the
peril
with
you
i
shall
again
grapple
with
the
foe
that
has
thus
bereaved
me
this
dark
mantle
cried
he
turning
toward
the
breathless
corpse
and
throwing
his
plaid
over
it
will
shroud
thy
hallowed
remains
till
i
return
i
go
where
thou
wouldst
direct
me
oh
my
father
exclaimed
he
in
a
burst
of
grief
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
thou
wilt
not
hear
but
i
go
to
take
vengeance
for
thy
blood
so
saying
he
sprung
from
the
place
and
accompanying
wallace
to
the
plain
took
his
station
in
the
silent
but
swiftly
moving
army
chapter
liv
carron
banks
the
troops
of
king
edward
lay
overpowered
with
wine
elated
with
victory
they
had
drunk
largely
the
royal
pavilion
setting
them
the
example
for
though
edward
was
temperate
yet
to
flatter
his
recovered
friends
the
inordinate
buchan
and
soulis
he
had
allowed
a
greater
excess
that
night
than
he
was
accustomed
to
sanction
the
banquet
over
every
knight
retired
to
his
tent
every
soldier
to
his
pallet
and
a
deep
sleep
lay
upon
every
man
the
king
himself
whose
many
thoughts
had
long
kept
him
waking
now
fell
into
a
slumber
guards
had
been
placed
around
the
camp
more
from
military
ceremony
than
an
idea
of
their
necessity
the
strength
of
wallace
they
believed
broken
and
that
they
should
have
nothing
to
do
next
morning
but
to
chase
him
into
stirling
and
take
him
there
but
the
spirit
of
the
regent
was
not
so
easily
subdued
he
ever
thought
it
shameful
to
despair
while
it
was
possible
to
make
a
stand
and
now
leading
his
determined
followers
through
the
lower
grounds
of
cumbernaul
he
detached
half
his
force
under
mar
to
take
the
southron
camp
in
the
rear
while
he
should
attack
the
front
and
pierce
his
way
to
the
royal
pavilion
with
soundless
caution
the
battalion
of
mar
wound
round
the
banks
of
the
forth
to
reach
the
point
of
its
destination
and
wallace
proceeding
with
as
noiseless
a
step
gained
the
hill
which
overlooked
his
sleeping
enemies
his
front
ranks
shrouded
by
branches
they
had
torn
from
the
trees
in
tor
wood
now
stood
still
without
this
precaution
had
any
eye
looked
from
the
southron
line
they
must
have
been
perceived
but
now
should
a
hundred
gaze
on
them
their
figures
were
so
blended
with
the
adjoining
thickets
they
might
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
part
of
them
as
the
moon
sunk
in
the
horizon
they
moved
gently
down
the
hill
and
scarcely
drawing
breath
were
within
a
few
paces
of
the
first
outpost
when
one
of
the
sentinels
starting
from
his
reclining
position
suddenly
exclaimed
what
sound
is
that
only
the
wind
amongst
the
trees
returned
his
comrade
i
see
their
branches
waving
let
me
sleep
for
wallace
yet
lives
and
we
may
have
hot
work
wallace
did
live
and
the
man
slept
to
wake
no
more
for
the
next
instant
a
scottish
brand
was
through
every
southron
heart
on
the
outpost
that
done
wallace
threw
away
his
bough
leaped
the
narrow
dike
which
lay
in
front
of
the
camp
and
with
bruce
and
graham
at
the
head
of
a
chosen
band
of
brave
men
cautiously
proceeded
onward
to
reach
the
pavilion
at
the
moment
he
should
blow
his
bugle
the
divisions
he
had
left
with
lennox
and
murray
and
the
lord
mar
were
to
press
forward
to
the
same
point
still
all
lay
in
profound
repose
and
guided
by
the
lamps
which
burned
around
the
royal
quarters
the
dauntless
scots
reached
the
tent
wallace
had
already
laid
his
hand
upon
the
curtain
that
was
its
entrance
when
an
armed
man
with
a
presented
pike
demanded
who
comes
here
the
regent
answer
laid
the
interrogator
head
at
his
feet
but
the
voice
had
awakened
the
ever
watchful
king
perceiving
his
own
danger
in
the
fall
of
the
sentinel
he
snatched
his
sword
and
calling
aloud
on
his
sleeping
train
sprung
from
his
couch
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
half
a
score
of
knights
who
started
on
their
feet
before
wallace
could
reach
the
spot
short
however
would
have
been
their
protection
they
fell
before
his
arm
and
that
of
graham
and
left
a
vacant
place
for
edward
had
disappeared
foreseeing
from
the
first
prowess
of
these
midnight
invaders
the
fate
of
his
guards
he
had
made
a
timely
escape
by
cutting
a
passage
for
himself
through
the
canvas
of
his
tent
wallace
perceived
that
his
prize
had
eluded
his
grasp
but
hoping
to
at
least
drive
him
from
the
field
he
blew
the
appointed
signal
to
mar
and
lennox
caught
one
of
the
lamps
from
the
table
and
setting
fire
to
the
adjoining
drapery
rushed
from
its
blazing
volumes
to
meet
his
brave
colleagues
amongst
the
disordered
lines
graham
and
his
followers
with
firebrands
in
their
hands
threw
conflagration
into
all
parts
of
the
camp
and
with
the
fearful
of
their
country
seemed
to
assail
the
terrified
enemy
from
every
direction
men
and
unarmed
rushed
from
their
tents
upon
the
pikes
of
their
enemies
hundreds
fell
without
striking
a
blow
and
they
who
were
stationed
nearest
the
outposts
betook
themselves
to
flight
scattering
themselves
in
scared
throngs
over
the
amazed
plains
of
linlithgow
the
king
in
vain
sought
to
rally
his
men
to
remind
them
of
their
late
victory
his
english
alone
hearkened
to
his
call
superstition
had
laid
her
petrifying
hand
on
all
the
rest
the
irish
saw
a
terrible
judgment
in
this
scene
believing
it
had
fallen
upon
them
for
having
taken
arms
against
their
sister
people
the
welsh
as
they
descried
the
warlike
bishop
of
dunkeld
issuing
from
the
mists
of
the
river
and
charging
his
foaming
steed
through
their
flying
defiles
could
not
persuade
themselves
that
merlin
had
not
arisen
to
chastise
their
obedience
to
the
ravager
of
their
country
every
superstition
every
panic
created
by
fear
took
possession
of
the
stupid
wretches
and
falling
in
bloody
and
unresisting
heaps
all
around
it
was
rather
a
slaughter
than
a
battle
opposition
seemed
everywhere
abandoned
excepting
on
the
spot
still
maintained
by
the
king
of
england
and
his
brave
countrymen
the
faithless
scots
who
had
followed
the
cummins
to
the
field
also
stood
there
and
fought
with
desperation
wallace
opposed
the
despair
and
valor
of
his
adversaries
with
the
steadiness
of
his
men
and
graham
having
seized
some
of
the
discharged
a
shower
of
blazing
arrows
upon
the
southron
phalanx
the
camp
was
now
on
fire
in
every
direction
and
putting
all
to
the
hazard
of
one
decisive
blow
edward
ordered
his
men
to
make
at
once
to
the
point
where
by
the
light
of
the
flaming
tents
he
could
perceive
the
waving
plumes
of
wallace
with
his
ponderous
mace
held
terribly
in
the
air
the
king
himself
bore
down
to
the
shock
and
breaking
through
the
intervening
combatants
assaulted
the
chief
the
might
of
ten
thousand
souls
was
then
in
the
arm
of
the
regent
of
scotland
the
puissant
edward
wondered
at
himself
as
he
shrunk
from
before
his
strokes
as
he
shuddered
at
the
heroic
fierceness
of
a
countenance
which
seemed
more
than
mortal
was
it
indeed
the
scottish
chieftain
or
some
armed
delegate
from
heaven
descended
to
flight
the
battles
of
the
oppressed
edward
trembled
his
mace
was
struck
from
his
hand
but
immediately
a
glittering
falchon
supplied
its
place
and
with
recovering
presence
of
mind
he
renewed
the
combat
meanwhile
the
young
bruce
who
in
his
humble
armor
might
have
been
passed
by
as
an
enemy
for
meaner
swords
checking
the
onward
speed
of
march
pierced
him
at
once
through
the
heart
die
thou
disgrace
to
the
name
of
scot
cried
he
and
with
thy
blood
expunge
my
stains
his
sword
now
laid
all
opposition
at
his
feet
and
while
the
tempest
of
death
blew
around
the
groans
of
the
dying
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
and
the
outcries
of
those
who
were
perishing
in
the
flames
drove
the
king
ranks
to
distraction
and
raised
so
great
a
fear
in
the
minds
of
the
cummin
clan
that
breaking
from
the
royal
line
with
yells
of
dismay
they
fled
in
all
directions
after
their
already
fugitive
allies
edward
saw
the
earl
of
march
fall
and
finding
himself
wounded
in
many
places
with
a
backward
step
he
received
the
blows
of
wallace
but
that
determined
chief
following
his
advantage
made
a
stroke
at
the
king
which
threw
him
astounded
into
the
arms
of
his
followers
at
that
moment
lincoln
raised
his
arm
to
strike
his
dagger
into
the
back
of
wallace
but
graham
arrested
the
blow
and
sent
the
young
motionless
body
to
the
earth
the
southron
ranks
closed
immediately
before
their
insensible
monarch
and
a
contest
more
desperate
than
any
which
had
preceded
it
took
place
hosts
seemed
to
fall
on
both
sides
at
last
the
southrons
having
stood
their
ground
till
edward
was
carried
from
further
danger
suddenly
wheeled
about
and
fled
precipitately
toward
the
east
wallace
pursued
them
on
full
charge
driving
them
across
the
lowlands
of
linlithgow
where
he
learned
from
some
prisoners
he
took
that
the
earl
of
carrick
was
in
the
lothians
having
retreated
hither
on
the
first
tidings
that
the
scots
had
attacked
the
english
camp
now
is
your
time
said
wallace
to
bruce
to
rejoin
your
father
bring
him
to
scotland
where
a
free
crown
awaits
him
your
actions
of
this
night
must
be
a
pledge
to
your
country
of
the
virtues
which
will
support
his
throne
the
young
warrior
throwing
off
his
rugged
hauberk
in
a
retired
glen
appeared
again
as
a
prince
and
embracing
the
regent
a
messenger
from
myself
or
from
my
father
said
he
shall
meet
you
at
stirling
meanwhile
farewell
and
give
my
thanks
to
the
young
gordon
whose
sword
armed
me
for
scotland
bruce
mounted
the
horse
wallace
had
prepared
and
spurring
along
the
banks
of
the
almond
was
soon
lost
amidst
its
luxuriant
shades
wallace
still
led
the
pursuit
of
edward
and
meeting
those
auxiliaries
from
the
adjoining
counties
which
his
provident
orders
had
prepared
to
turn
out
on
the
first
appearance
of
this
martial
chase
he
poured
his
troops
through
ettrick
forest
and
drove
the
flying
host
of
england
far
into
northumberland
there
checking
his
triumphant
squadrons
he
recalled
his
stragglers
and
returned
with
abated
speed
into
his
own
country
halting
on
the
north
bank
of
the
twee
he
sent
to
their
quarters
those
hands
which
belonged
to
the
border
castles
and
then
marched
leisurely
forward
that
his
brave
soldiers
who
had
sustained
the
weight
of
the
battle
might
recover
their
exhausted
strength
at
peebles
he
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
sight
of
edwin
though
ignorant
of
the
recommenced
hostilities
of
edward
lord
ruthven
became
so
impatient
to
resume
his
duties
that
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
move
he
had
set
off
on
his
return
to
perth
on
arriving
at
huntingtower
he
was
told
of
the
treachery
of
march
also
of
his
fate
and
that
the
regent
had
beaten
the
enemy
on
the
banks
of
the
carron
and
was
pursuing
him
into
his
own
dominions
ruthven
was
inadequate
to
the
exertion
of
following
the
successful
troops
but
edwin
rejoicing
at
this
new
victory
would
not
be
detained
and
crossing
the
forth
into
had
sped
his
eager
way
until
the
happy
moment
that
brought
him
again
to
the
side
of
his
first
and
dearest
friend
as
they
continued
their
route
together
edwin
inquired
the
events
of
the
past
time
and
heard
them
related
with
wonder
horror
and
gratitude
grateful
for
the
preservation
of
wallace
grateful
for
the
rescue
of
his
country
from
the
menaced
destruction
for
some
time
he
could
only
clasp
his
friend
hand
with
strong
emotion
to
his
heart
the
death
of
his
uncle
bothwell
made
that
heart
tremble
within
him
at
the
thought
of
how
much
severer
might
have
been
his
deprivation
at
last
extricating
his
powers
of
speech
from
the
spell
of
contradictory
feelings
which
enchained
them
he
said
but
if
my
uncle
mar
and
our
brave
graham
were
in
the
last
conflict
where
are
they
that
i
do
not
see
them
share
your
victory
i
hope
returned
wallace
that
we
shall
rejoin
them
in
safety
at
stirling
our
troops
parted
in
the
pursuit
and
after
having
sent
back
the
lowland
chieftains
you
see
i
have
none
with
me
now
but
my
own
particular
followers
the
regent
expectations
that
he
should
soon
fall
in
with
some
of
the
chasing
squadrons
were
the
next
morning
gratified
crossing
the
bathgate
hills
he
met
the
returning
battalions
of
lennox
with
lord
mar
and
also
sir
john
graham
lord
lennox
was
thanked
by
wallace
for
his
good
services
and
immediately
dispatched
to
reoccupy
his
station
in
dumbarton
but
the
captains
of
mar
and
of
graham
could
give
no
other
account
of
their
leaders
than
that
they
saw
them
last
fighting
valiantly
in
the
southron
camp
and
had
since
supposed
that
during
the
pursuit
they
must
have
joined
the
regent
squadron
a
cold
dew
fell
over
the
limbs
of
wallace
at
these
tidings
he
looked
on
murray
and
on
edwin
the
expression
of
the
former
face
told
him
what
were
his
fears
but
edwin
ever
sanguine
strove
to
encourage
the
hope
that
all
might
yet
be
well
they
may
not
have
yet
returned
from
the
pursuit
or
they
may
be
gone
on
to
stirling
but
these
comfortings
were
soon
dispelled
by
the
appearance
of
lord
ruthven
who
having
been
apprised
of
the
regent
approach
came
forth
to
meet
him
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
earl
so
far
recovered
as
to
have
been
able
to
leave
huntingtower
was
checked
by
the
first
glance
of
his
face
on
which
was
deeply
characterized
some
tale
of
grief
edwin
thought
it
was
the
recent
disasters
of
scotland
he
mourned
and
with
a
cheering
voice
he
exclaimed
courage
my
father
our
regent
comes
again
a
conqueror
edward
has
once
more
recrossed
the
plains
of
northumberland
thanks
be
to
god
for
that
replied
ruthven
but
what
have
not
these
last
conflicts
cost
the
country
lord
mar
is
wounded
unto
death
and
lies
in
a
chamber
next
to
the
yet
unburied
corpses
of
lord
bute
and
the
dauntless
graham
wallace
turned
deadly
pale
a
mist
passed
over
his
eyes
and
staggering
he
breathlessly
supported
himself
on
the
arm
of
edwin
murray
looked
on
him
but
all
was
still
in
his
heart
his
own
beloved
father
had
fallen
and
in
that
stroke
fate
seemed
to
have
emptied
all
her
quiver
lead
me
to
their
chambers
cried
wallace
show
me
where
my
friends
lie
let
me
hear
the
last
prayer
for
scotland
from
the
lips
of
the
bravest
of
her
veterans
ruthven
turned
the
head
of
his
horse
and
as
he
rode
along
he
informed
the
regent
that
edwin
had
not
left
huntingtower
for
the
forth
half
an
hour
when
an
express
arrived
from
falkirk
by
it
he
learned
that
as
soon
as
the
inhabitants
of
stirling
saw
the
fire
of
the
southron
camp
they
had
hastened
thither
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
some
bolder
than
the
rest
entered
its
deserted
confines
for
the
retreating
squadrons
were
then
flying
over
the
plain
and
amidst
the
slaughtered
near
the
royal
tent
one
of
these
visitors
thought
he
distinguished
groans
whether
friend
or
foe
he
stooped
to
render
assistance
to
the
sufferer
and
soon
found
it
to
be
lord
mar
the
earl
begged
to
be
carried
to
some
shelter
that
he
might
see
his
wife
and
daughter
before
he
died
the
people
drew
him
out
from
under
his
horse
and
many
a
mangled
corpse
and
wrapping
him
in
their
plaids
conveyed
him
to
falkirk
where
they
lodged
him
in
the
convent
a
messenger
was
instantly
dispatched
to
me
continued
ruthven
and
indifferent
to
all
personal
considerations
i
set
out
immediately
i
saw
my
dying
at
his
request
that
others
might
not
suffer
what
he
had
endured
under
the
pressure
of
the
slain
the
field
had
been
sought
for
the
wounded
many
were
conveyed
into
the
neighboring
houses
while
the
dead
were
consigned
to
the
earth
deep
have
been
dug
the
graves
of
mingled
scot
and
english
on
the
banks
of
the
carron
many
of
our
fallen
nobles
amongst
whom
was
the
princely
badenoch
have
been
conveyed
to
the
cemetery
of
their
ancestors
others
are
entombed
in
the
church
of
falkirk
but
the
bodies
of
sir
john
graham
and
my
brother
bothwell
said
he
in
a
lower
tone
i
have
retained
till
your
return
you
have
done
right
replied
the
till
then
silent
wallace
and
spurring
forward
he
saw
not
the
ground
he
trod
till
ascending
the
hill
of
falkirk
the
venerable
walls
of
its
monastery
presented
themselves
to
his
view
he
threw
himself
off
his
horse
and
entered
preceded
by
lord
ruthven
he
stopped
before
the
cell
which
contained
the
dying
chief
and
desired
the
abbot
to
apprise
the
earl
of
his
arrival
the
sound
of
that
voice
whose
tones
could
be
matched
by
none
on
earth
penetrated
to
the
ear
of
his
almost
insensible
friend
mar
started
from
his
pillow
and
wallace
through
the
door
heard
him
say
let
him
come
in
joanna
all
my
mortal
hopes
now
hang
on
him
wallace
instantly
stepped
forward
and
beheld
the
veteran
stretched
on
a
couch
the
image
of
that
death
to
which
he
was
so
rapidly
approaching
he
hastened
toward
him
and
the
dying
man
stretching
forth
his
arms
exclaimed
come
to
me
wallace
my
son
the
only
hope
of
scotland
the
only
human
trust
of
this
anxious
paternal
heart
wallace
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
taking
his
hand
pressed
it
in
speechless
anguish
to
his
lips
every
present
grief
was
then
weighing
on
his
soul
and
denied
him
the
power
of
utterance
lady
mar
sat
by
the
pillow
of
her
husband
but
she
bore
no
marks
of
the
sorrow
which
convulsed
the
frame
of
wallace
she
looked
serious
but
her
cheek
wore
its
freshest
bloom
she
spoke
not
and
the
veteran
allowed
the
tears
of
enfeebled
nature
to
fall
on
the
bent
head
of
his
friend
mourn
not
for
me
cried
he
nor
think
that
these
are
regretful
drops
i
die
as
i
have
wished
in
the
field
for
scotland
time
must
have
soon
laid
my
gray
hair
ignobly
in
the
grave
and
to
enter
it
thus
covered
with
honorable
wounds
in
glory
has
long
been
my
prayer
but
dearest
most
unwearied
of
friends
still
the
tears
of
mortality
will
flow
for
i
leave
my
children
fatherless
in
this
faithless
world
and
my
helen
oh
wallace
the
angel
who
exposed
her
precious
self
through
the
dangers
of
that
midnight
walk
to
save
scotland
her
father
and
his
friends
is
lost
to
us
joanna
tell
the
rest
said
he
gasping
for
i
can
not
wallace
turned
to
lady
mar
with
an
inquiring
look
of
such
wild
horror
that
she
found
her
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
her
complexion
faded
into
the
pallidness
of
his
surely
exclaimed
he
there
is
not
to
be
a
wreck
of
all
that
is
estimable
on
earth
the
lady
helen
is
not
dead
no
rejoined
the
earl
he
could
proceed
no
further
and
lady
mar
forced
herself
to
speak
she
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
on
my
lord
being
brought
to
this
place
he
sent
for
myself
and
lady
helen
but
in
passing
by
dunipacis
an
armed
squadron
issued
from
behind
the
mound
and
putting
our
attendants
to
flight
carried
her
off
i
escaped
hither
the
reason
for
this
attack
was
explained
afterward
by
one
of
the
southrons
who
having
been
wounded
by
our
escort
was
taken
and
brought
to
falkirk
he
said
that
lord
aymer
de
valence
having
been
sent
by
his
beset
monarch
to
call
lord
carrick
to
his
assistance
found
the
bruce
camp
deserted
but
by
accident
learning
that
lady
helen
mar
was
to
be
brought
to
falkirk
he
stationed
himself
behind
dunipacis
and
springing
out
as
soon
as
our
cavalcade
was
in
view
seized
her
she
obtained
the
rest
were
allowed
to
escape
but
as
the
lord
de
valence
loves
helen
i
can
not
doubt
he
will
have
sufficient
honor
not
to
insult
the
fame
of
her
family
and
so
will
make
her
his
wife
god
forbid
ejaculated
mar
holding
up
his
trembling
hands
god
forbid
that
my
blood
should
ever
mingle
with
that
of
any
one
of
the
people
who
have
wrought
such
woe
to
scotland
swear
to
me
valiant
wallace
by
the
virtues
of
her
virgin
heart
by
your
own
immaculate
honor
that
you
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
rescue
my
helen
from
the
power
of
his
southron
lord
so
help
me
heaven
answered
wallace
looking
steadfastly
upward
a
groan
burst
from
the
lips
of
lady
mar
and
her
head
sunk
on
the
side
of
the
couch
what
who
is
that
exclaimed
mar
raising
his
head
in
alarm
from
his
pillow
believe
it
your
country
donald
replied
she
to
what
do
you
bind
its
only
defender
are
you
not
throwing
him
into
the
very
center
of
his
enemies
by
making
him
swear
to
rescue
helen
think
you
that
de
valence
will
not
foresee
a
pursuit
and
take
her
into
the
heart
of
england
and
thither
must
our
regent
follow
him
release
sir
william
wallace
from
a
vow
that
must
destroy
him
wallace
cried
the
now
earl
what
have
i
done
has
a
father
anxiety
asked
amiss
if
so
pardon
me
but
if
my
daughter
also
must
perish
for
scotland
take
her
o
god
uncontaminated
and
let
us
meet
in
heaven
wallace
i
dare
not
accept
your
vow
but
i
will
fulfill
it
cried
he
let
thy
paternal
heart
rest
in
peace
and
by
jesus
help
lady
helen
shall
again
be
in
her
own
country
as
free
from
southron
taint
as
she
is
from
all
mortal
sin
de
valence
dare
not
approach
her
heavenly
innocence
with
violence
and
her
scottish
heart
will
never
consent
to
give
him
a
lawful
claim
to
her
precious
self
edward
legions
are
far
beyond
the
borders
but
wherever
this
earl
may
be
yet
i
will
reach
him
for
there
is
a
guiding
hand
above
and
the
demands
of
the
morning
at
falkirk
are
now
to
be
answered
in
the
halls
of
stirling
lord
ruthven
followed
by
edwin
and
murray
entered
the
room
and
the
two
nephews
were
holding
each
a
hand
of
their
dying
uncle
in
theirs
when
lady
ruthven
who
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
had
retired
an
hour
before
reappeared
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
she
had
been
informed
of
the
arrival
of
the
regent
and
her
son
and
now
hastened
to
give
them
a
sorrowful
welcome
ah
my
lord
cried
she
as
wallace
pressed
her
matron
cheek
to
his
this
is
not
as
your
triumphs
are
wont
to
be
greeted
you
are
still
a
conqueror
and
yet
death
dreadful
death
lies
all
around
us
and
our
helen
too
shall
be
restored
to
you
by
the
blessed
aid
of
heaven
returned
he
what
is
yet
left
for
me
to
do
must
be
done
and
he
paused
and
added
the
time
is
not
far
distant
then
he
paused
and
added
the
time
is
not
far
distant
lady
ruthven
when
we
shall
meet
in
the
realms
to
which
so
many
of
our
bravest
and
dearest
have
just
hastened
with
swimming
eyes
edwin
drew
toward
his
master
my
uncle
would
sleep
said
he
he
is
exhausted
and
will
recall
us
when
he
wakes
from
rest
the
eyes
of
the
veteran
were
at
that
moment
closed
with
heavy
slumber
lady
ruthven
remained
with
the
countess
to
watch
by
him
and
wallace
gently
withdrawing
was
followed
by
ruthven
and
the
two
young
men
out
of
the
apartment
lord
lochawe
with
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
and
other
chiefs
lay
in
different
chambers
pierced
with
many
wounds
but
none
so
grievous
as
those
of
lord
mar
wallace
visited
them
all
and
having
gone
through
the
numerous
places
in
the
neighborhood
then
made
quarters
for
his
wounded
men
at
the
gloom
of
evening
he
returned
to
falkirk
he
sent
edwin
forward
to
inquire
after
the
repose
of
his
uncle
but
on
himself
the
monastery
he
requested
the
abbot
to
conduct
him
to
the
apartment
in
which
the
remains
of
sir
john
graham
were
deposited
the
father
obeyed
leading
him
along
a
dark
passage
he
opened
a
door
and
discovered
the
slain
hero
lying
on
a
bier
two
monks
sat
at
its
head
with
tapers
in
their
hands
wallace
waved
them
to
withdraw
they
set
down
the
lights
and
departed
he
was
then
alone
for
some
time
he
stood
with
clasped
hands
looking
intently
on
the
body
as
it
lay
extended
before
him
graham
graham
cried
he
at
last
in
a
voice
of
unutterable
grief
dost
thou
not
rise
at
thy
voice
oh
is
this
to
be
the
tidings
i
am
to
send
to
the
brave
father
who
intrusted
to
me
his
son
lost
in
the
prime
of
youth
in
the
opening
of
thy
renown
is
it
thus
that
all
which
is
good
is
to
be
martyrized
by
the
enemies
of
scotland
he
sunk
gradually
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
shall
i
not
look
once
more
on
that
face
said
he
which
ever
turned
toward
mine
with
looks
of
faith
and
love
the
shroud
was
drawn
down
by
his
hand
he
started
on
his
feet
at
the
sight
the
changing
touch
of
death
had
altered
every
feature
had
deepened
the
paleness
of
the
bloodless
corpse
into
an
ashy
hue
where
is
the
countenance
of
my
friend
cried
he
where
the
spirit
which
once
moved
in
beauty
and
animating
light
over
this
face
gone
and
all
i
see
before
me
is
a
mass
of
molded
clay
graham
graham
cried
he
looking
upward
thou
art
not
here
no
more
can
i
recognize
my
friend
in
this
deserted
habitation
of
thy
soul
thine
own
proper
self
thine
immortal
spirit
is
ascended
up
above
and
there
my
fond
remembrance
shall
ever
seek
thee
again
he
knelt
but
it
was
in
devotion
a
devotion
which
drew
the
sting
from
death
and
opened
to
his
view
the
victory
of
the
lord
of
life
over
the
king
of
terrors
edward
having
learned
from
his
father
that
lord
mar
still
slept
and
being
told
by
the
abbot
where
the
regent
was
followed
him
to
the
consecrated
chamber
on
entering
he
perceived
him
kneeling
by
the
body
of
his
friend
the
youth
drew
near
he
loved
the
brave
graham
and
he
almost
adored
wallace
the
scene
therefore
smote
upon
his
heart
he
dropped
down
by
the
side
of
the
regent
and
throwing
his
arms
around
his
neck
in
a
convulsive
voice
exclaimed
our
friend
is
gone
but
i
yet
live
and
only
in
your
smiles
my
friend
and
brother
wallace
strained
him
to
his
breast
he
was
silent
for
some
minutes
and
then
said
to
every
dispensation
of
god
i
am
resigned
my
edwin
while
i
bow
to
this
stroke
i
acknowledge
the
blessing
i
still
hold
in
you
and
murray
but
did
we
not
feel
these
visitations
from
our
maker
they
would
not
be
decreed
to
us
to
behold
the
dead
is
the
penalty
of
man
for
sin
for
it
is
more
pain
to
witness
and
to
occasion
death
than
for
ourselves
to
die
it
is
also
a
lesson
which
god
teaches
his
sons
and
in
the
moment
that
he
shows
us
death
he
convinces
us
of
immortality
look
upon
that
face
edwin
continued
he
turning
his
eyes
on
the
breathless
clay
his
youthful
auditor
awestruck
and
his
tears
checked
by
the
solemnity
of
this
address
looked
as
he
directed
him
doth
not
that
inanimate
mold
of
earth
testify
that
nothing
less
than
an
immortal
spirit
could
have
lighted
up
its
marble
substance
with
the
life
and
actions
we
have
seen
it
perform
edwin
shuddered
and
wallace
letting
the
shroud
fall
over
the
face
added
never
more
will
i
look
at
it
for
it
no
longer
wears
the
characters
of
my
friend
they
are
pictured
on
my
soul
and
himself
my
edwin
still
effulgent
in
beauty
and
glowing
with
imperishable
life
looks
down
on
us
from
heaven
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
opening
the
door
the
monks
and
placing
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
bier
chanted
the
vesper
requiem
when
it
was
ended
wallace
kissed
the
crucifix
they
laid
on
his
friend
breast
and
left
the
cell
chapter
lv
church
of
falkirk
no
eye
closed
that
night
in
the
monastery
of
falkirk
the
earl
of
mar
awaked
about
the
twelfth
hour
and
sent
to
call
lord
ruthven
sir
william
wallace
and
his
nephews
to
attend
him
as
they
approached
the
priests
who
had
just
anointed
his
dying
head
with
the
sacred
unction
drew
back
the
countess
and
lady
ruthven
supported
his
pillow
he
smiled
as
he
heard
the
advancing
steps
of
those
so
dear
to
him
i
send
for
you
said
he
to
give
you
the
blessing
of
a
true
scot
and
a
christian
may
all
who
are
here
in
thy
blessed
presence
redeemer
of
mankind
cried
he
looking
up
with
a
supernatural
brightness
in
his
eye
die
as
i
do
rather
than
survive
to
see
scotland
enslaved
but
oh
may
they
rather
long
live
under
that
liberty
perpetuated
which
wallace
has
again
given
to
his
country
peaceful
will
then
be
their
last
moments
on
earth
and
full
of
joy
their
entrance
into
heaven
his
eyes
closed
as
the
concluding
word
died
upon
his
tongue
lady
ruthven
looked
intently
on
him
she
bent
her
face
to
his
but
he
breathed
no
more
and
with
a
feeble
cry
she
fell
back
in
a
swoon
the
soul
of
the
veteran
earl
was
indeed
fled
the
countess
was
taken
shrieking
out
of
the
apartment
but
wallace
edwin
and
murray
remained
kneeling
over
the
body
and
when
they
concluded
the
priests
throwing
over
it
a
cloud
of
incense
the
mourners
withdrew
and
separated
to
their
chambers
by
daybreak
wallace
met
murray
by
appointment
in
the
cloisters
the
remains
of
his
beloved
father
had
been
brought
from
dunipacis
to
the
convent
and
murray
now
prepare
to
take
them
to
bothwell
castle
there
to
be
interred
in
the
cemetery
of
his
ancestors
wallace
who
had
approved
his
design
entered
with
him
into
the
solitary
where
the
stood
which
was
to
convey
the
deceased
earl
to
clydesdale
four
soldiers
of
his
clan
brought
the
corpse
of
their
lord
from
a
cell
and
laid
him
on
his
martial
bier
his
bed
was
the
sweet
heather
of
falkirk
spread
by
the
hands
of
his
son
as
wallace
laid
the
venerable
chief
sword
and
helmet
on
his
bier
he
covered
the
whole
with
the
flag
he
had
torn
from
the
standard
of
england
in
the
last
victory
none
other
shroud
is
worthy
of
thy
virtues
cried
he
dying
for
scotland
thus
let
the
memorial
of
her
glory
be
the
witness
of
thine
oh
my
friend
answered
murray
looking
on
his
chief
with
a
smile
which
beamed
the
fairer
shining
through
sorrow
thy
gracious
spirit
can
divest
even
death
of
its
gloom
my
father
yet
lives
in
his
fame
and
in
a
better
existence
too
gently
replied
wallace
else
the
earth
fame
were
an
empty
shroud
it
could
not
comfort
the
solemn
procession
with
murray
at
its
head
departed
toward
the
valleys
of
clydesdale
and
wallace
returned
to
his
chamber
two
hours
before
noon
he
was
summoned
by
the
tolling
of
the
chapel
bell
the
earl
of
bute
and
his
dearer
friend
were
to
be
laid
in
their
last
bed
with
a
spirit
that
did
not
murmur
he
saw
the
earth
closed
over
both
graves
but
at
graham
he
lingered
and
when
the
funeral
stone
shut
even
the
sod
that
covered
him
from
his
eyes
with
his
sword
point
he
drew
on
the
surface
these
memorable
words
mente
manuque
potens
et
walli
fidus
achates
conditus
hic
gramus
bello
interfectus
ab
anglis
lines
may
be
translated
thus
here
lies
the
powerful
in
mind
and
body
the
friend
of
wallace
graham
faithful
unto
death
slain
in
battle
by
the
english
while
he
yet
leaned
on
the
stone
which
gently
gave
way
to
the
registering
pen
of
friendship
to
be
more
deeply
engraved
afterward
a
monk
approached
him
attended
by
a
shepherd
boy
at
the
sound
of
steps
wallace
looked
up
this
young
man
said
the
father
brings
dispatches
to
the
lord
regent
wallace
rose
and
the
youth
presented
his
packet
withdrawing
to
a
little
distance
he
broke
the
seal
and
read
to
this
effect
my
father
and
myself
are
in
the
castle
of
durham
and
both
under
an
arrest
we
are
to
remain
so
till
our
arrival
in
london
renders
its
sovereign
in
his
own
opinion
more
secure
when
there
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
meanwhile
be
on
your
guard
the
gold
of
edward
has
found
its
way
into
your
councils
beware
of
them
who
with
patriotism
in
their
mouths
are
purchased
to
betray
you
and
their
country
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
truest
noblest
best
of
scots
farewell
i
must
not
write
more
explicitly
the
messenger
who
takes
this
is
a
simple
border
shepherd
he
knows
not
whence
comes
the
packet
hence
he
can
not
bring
an
answer
wallace
closed
the
letter
and
putting
gold
into
the
shepherd
hand
left
the
chapel
in
passing
through
the
cloisters
he
met
ruthven
just
returned
from
stirling
whither
he
had
gone
to
inform
the
chiefs
of
the
council
of
the
regent
arrival
when
i
summoned
them
to
the
continued
lord
ruthven
and
told
them
you
had
not
only
defeated
edward
on
the
carron
but
in
so
doing
had
gained
a
double
victory
over
a
foreign
usurper
and
domestic
traitors
of
the
usual
gratulations
on
such
a
communication
a
low
whisper
murmured
through
the
hall
and
the
young
badenoch
unworthy
of
his
patriotic
father
rising
from
his
seat
gave
utterance
to
so
many
invectives
against
you
our
country
soul
and
arm
i
should
deem
it
treason
even
to
repeat
them
suffice
it
to
say
that
out
of
five
hundred
chiefs
and
chieftains
who
were
present
not
one
of
those
parasites
who
used
to
fawn
on
you
a
week
ago
and
make
the
love
of
honest
men
seem
doubtful
now
breathes
one
word
for
sir
william
wallace
but
this
ingratitude
vile
as
it
is
i
bore
with
patience
till
badenoch
growing
in
insolency
declared
that
late
last
night
dispatches
had
arrived
from
the
king
of
france
to
the
regent
and
that
he
in
right
of
his
birth
assuming
to
himself
that
dignity
had
put
their
bearer
sir
alexander
ramsay
under
confinement
for
having
persisted
to
dispute
his
authority
to
withhold
them
from
you
wallace
who
had
listened
in
silence
drew
a
deep
sigh
as
ruthven
concluded
and
in
that
profound
breath
exclaimed
god
must
be
our
fortress
still
must
save
scotland
from
this
gangrene
in
her
heart
ramsay
shall
be
released
but
i
must
first
meet
these
violent
men
and
it
must
be
alone
my
lord
continued
he
you
and
our
coadjutors
may
wait
my
return
at
the
city
gates
but
the
sword
of
edward
if
need
be
shall
defend
me
against
his
gold
as
he
spoke
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
jeweled
weapon
which
hung
at
his
side
and
which
he
had
wrested
from
that
monarch
in
the
last
conflict
aware
that
this
treason
aimed
at
him
would
strike
his
country
unless
timely
warded
off
he
took
his
resolution
and
requesting
ruthven
not
to
communicate
to
any
one
what
had
passed
he
mounted
his
horse
and
struck
into
the
road
to
stirling
he
took
the
plume
from
his
crest
and
closing
his
visor
enveloped
himself
in
his
plaid
that
the
people
might
not
know
him
as
he
went
along
but
casting
away
his
cloak
and
unclasping
his
helmet
at
the
door
of
the
keep
he
entered
the
openly
and
abruptly
by
an
instantaneous
impulse
of
respect
which
even
the
base
pay
to
virtue
almost
every
man
arose
at
his
appearance
he
bowed
to
the
assembly
and
walked
with
a
composed
yet
severe
air
up
to
his
station
at
the
head
of
the
room
young
badenoch
stood
there
and
as
wallace
approached
he
fiercely
grasped
his
sword
proud
upstart
cried
he
betrayer
of
my
father
set
a
foot
further
toward
this
chair
and
the
chastisement
of
every
arm
in
this
council
shall
fall
on
you
for
your
presumption
it
is
not
in
the
arms
of
thousands
to
put
me
from
my
right
replied
wallace
calmly
putting
forth
his
hand
and
drawing
the
regent
chair
toward
him
will
ye
bear
this
cried
badenoch
stamping
with
his
foot
and
plucking
forth
his
sword
is
the
man
to
exist
who
thus
braves
the
assembled
lords
of
scotland
while
speaking
he
made
a
desperate
lunge
at
the
regent
breast
wallace
caught
the
blade
in
his
hand
and
wrenching
it
from
his
intemperate
adversary
broke
it
into
shivers
and
cast
the
pieces
at
his
feet
then
turning
resolutely
toward
the
chiefs
who
stood
appalled
and
looking
on
each
other
he
said
i
your
duly
elected
regent
left
you
only
a
few
days
ago
to
repel
the
enemy
whom
the
treason
of
lord
march
would
have
introduced
into
these
very
walls
many
brave
chiefs
followed
me
to
that
field
and
more
whom
i
see
now
loaded
me
as
i
passed
with
benedictions
portentous
was
the
day
of
falkirk
to
scotland
then
did
the
mighty
fall
and
the
heads
of
counsel
perish
but
treason
was
the
parricide
the
late
lord
badenoch
stood
his
ground
like
a
true
scot
but
athol
and
buchan
deserted
to
edward
while
speaking
he
turned
toward
the
furious
son
of
badenoch
who
gnashing
his
teeth
in
impotent
rage
stood
listening
to
the
inflaming
whispers
of
macdougal
of
lorn
young
chief
cried
he
from
their
treachery
date
the
fate
of
your
brave
father
and
the
whole
of
our
grievous
loss
of
that
day
but
the
wide
destruction
has
been
avenged
more
than
chief
for
chief
have
perished
in
the
southron
ranks
and
thousands
of
the
lowlier
sort
now
swell
the
banks
of
carron
edward
himself
fell
wounded
by
my
arm
and
was
born
by
his
flying
squadrons
over
the
wastes
of
northumberland
thus
have
i
returned
to
you
with
my
duties
achieved
in
a
manner
worthy
of
your
regent
what
then
means
the
arrest
of
my
embassador
what
this
silence
when
the
representative
of
your
power
is
insulted
to
your
face
they
mean
cried
badenoch
that
my
words
are
the
utterance
of
their
sentiments
they
mean
cried
lorn
that
the
prowess
of
the
haughty
boaster
whom
their
intoxicated
gratitude
raised
from
the
dust
shall
not
avail
him
against
the
indignation
of
a
nation
over
which
he
dares
to
arrogate
a
right
mean
they
what
they
will
returned
wallace
they
can
not
dispossess
me
of
the
rights
with
which
assembled
scotland
invested
me
on
the
plains
of
stirling
and
again
i
demand
by
what
authority
do
you
and
they
presume
to
imprison
my
officer
and
withhold
from
me
the
papers
sent
by
the
king
of
france
to
the
regent
of
scotland
by
the
authority
that
we
will
maintain
replied
badenoch
by
the
right
of
my
royal
blood
and
by
the
sword
of
every
brave
scot
who
spurns
at
the
name
of
wallace
and
as
a
proof
that
we
speak
not
more
than
we
act
cried
lorn
making
assign
to
the
chiefs
you
are
our
prisoner
many
weapons
were
instantly
unsheathed
and
their
bearers
hurrying
to
the
side
of
badenoch
and
lorn
attempted
to
lay
hands
on
wallace
but
he
drawing
the
sword
of
edward
with
a
sweep
of
his
valiant
arm
that
made
the
glittering
blade
seem
a
brand
of
fire
set
his
back
against
the
wall
and
exclaimed
he
that
first
makes
a
stroke
at
me
shall
find
his
death
on
this
southron
steel
this
sword
i
made
the
puissant
arm
of
the
usurper
yield
to
me
and
this
sword
shall
defend
the
regent
of
scotland
against
his
ungrateful
countrymen
the
chieftains
who
pressed
on
him
recoiled
at
these
words
but
their
leaders
badenoch
and
lorn
waved
them
forward
with
vehement
exhortations
desist
young
men
continued
he
provoke
me
not
beyond
my
bearing
with
a
single
blast
of
my
bugle
i
could
surround
this
building
with
a
band
of
warriors
who
at
sight
of
their
chief
being
thus
assaulted
would
lay
this
tumult
in
blood
let
me
pass
or
abide
the
consequence
through
my
breast
then
exclaimed
badenoch
for
with
my
consent
you
pass
not
here
but
on
your
bier
what
is
in
the
arm
of
a
single
man
cried
he
to
the
lords
that
ye
can
not
fall
on
him
at
once
and
cut
him
down
i
would
not
hurt
a
son
of
the
virtuous
badenoch
returned
wallace
but
his
life
be
on
your
hands
said
he
turning
to
the
chiefs
if
one
of
you
point
a
sword
to
impede
my
passage
and
wilt
thou
dare
it
usurper
of
my
powers
and
honors
cried
badenoch
lorn
stand
by
your
friend
all
here
who
are
true
to
the
cummin
and
macdougal
hem
in
the
tyrant
many
a
traitor
hand
now
drew
forth
its
dagger
and
the
intemperate
badenoch
drunk
with
choler
and
mad
ambition
snatching
a
sword
from
one
of
his
accomplices
made
another
violent
plunge
at
wallace
but
its
metal
flew
in
splinters
on
the
of
the
regent
and
left
badenoch
at
his
mercy
defend
me
chieftains
or
i
am
slain
cried
he
but
wallace
did
not
let
his
hand
follow
its
advantage
with
the
dignity
of
conscious
desert
he
turned
from
the
vanquished
and
casting
the
enraged
lorn
from
him
who
had
thrown
himself
in
his
way
he
exclaimed
scots
that
arm
will
wither
which
dares
to
point
its
steel
on
me
the
pressing
crowd
struck
in
astonishment
parted
before
him
as
they
could
have
done
in
the
path
of
a
thunderbolt
and
unimpeded
he
passed
to
the
door
that
their
regent
had
entered
the
keep
was
soon
rumored
through
the
city
and
when
he
appeared
from
the
gate
he
was
hailed
by
the
acclamations
of
the
people
he
found
his
empire
again
in
the
hearts
of
the
lowly
they
whom
he
had
restored
to
their
cottages
knelt
to
him
in
the
streets
and
called
for
blessings
on
his
name
while
they
oh
blasting
touch
of
envy
he
had
restored
to
castles
and
elevated
from
a
state
of
vassalage
to
the
power
of
princes
they
raised
against
him
that
very
power
to
lay
him
in
the
dust
now
it
was
that
when
surrounded
by
the
grateful
citizens
of
stirling
whom
it
would
have
been
as
easy
for
him
to
have
inflamed
to
the
massacre
of
badenoch
and
his
council
as
to
have
lifted
his
bugle
to
his
lips
that
he
blew
the
summons
for
his
captains
every
man
in
the
keep
flew
to
arms
expecting
that
wallace
was
returning
upon
them
with
the
host
he
had
threatened
in
a
few
minutes
the
lord
ruthven
with
his
brave
followers
entered
the
inner
ballium
gate
wallace
smiled
proudly
as
they
drew
near
my
lords
said
he
you
come
to
witness
the
last
act
of
my
delegated
power
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
enter
into
that
hall
which
was
once
the
seat
of
council
and
tell
the
violent
men
who
fill
it
that
for
the
peace
of
scotland
which
i
value
more
than
my
life
i
allow
them
to
stand
unpunished
of
their
offense
against
me
but
the
outrage
they
have
committed
on
the
freedom
of
one
of
her
bravest
sons
i
will
not
pardon
unless
he
be
immediately
set
at
liberty
let
them
deliver
to
you
sir
alexander
ramsay
and
then
i
permit
them
to
hear
my
final
decision
if
they
refuse
obedience
they
are
all
my
prisoners
and
but
for
my
pity
on
their
blindness
should
perish
by
the
laws
eager
to
open
the
prison
door
for
his
friend
ramsay
and
little
suspecting
to
what
he
was
calling
the
insurgents
scrymgeour
hastened
to
obey
lorn
and
badenoch
gave
him
a
very
rough
reception
uttering
such
rebellious
defiance
of
the
regent
that
the
brave
lost
all
patience
and
denounced
the
immediate
deaths
of
the
whole
refractory
assembly
the
courtyard
cried
he
is
armed
with
thousands
of
the
regent
followers
his
foot
is
on
your
necks
obey
or
this
will
be
a
more
grievous
day
for
scotland
than
even
that
of
falkirk
for
the
castle
of
stirling
will
run
with
scottish
blood
at
this
menace
badenoch
became
more
enraged
and
scrymgeour
seeing
no
chance
of
prevailing
by
argument
sent
a
messenger
to
privately
tell
wallace
the
result
the
regent
immediately
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
twenty
men
and
the
keep
went
directly
to
the
warder
whom
he
ordered
on
his
allegiance
to
the
laws
to
deliver
sir
alexander
ramsay
into
his
hands
he
was
obeyed
and
returned
with
his
recovered
chieftain
to
the
platform
when
scrymgeour
was
apprised
of
the
knight
release
he
turned
to
badenoch
with
whom
he
was
still
contending
in
furious
debate
and
demanded
will
you
or
will
you
not
attend
me
to
the
regent
he
of
you
all
added
he
addressing
the
chieftains
who
in
this
simple
duty
disobeys
shall
receive
from
him
the
severer
doom
badenoch
and
lorn
affecting
to
deride
this
menace
replied
they
would
not
for
an
empire
do
the
usurper
the
homage
of
a
moment
voluntary
attention
but
if
any
of
their
followers
chose
to
view
the
mockery
they
were
at
liberty
a
very
few
and
those
of
the
least
turbulent
spirits
went
forth
they
began
to
fear
having
embarked
in
a
desperate
cause
and
by
their
present
acquiescence
were
willing
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
wallace
while
thus
assured
of
not
exciting
the
resentment
of
badenoch
when
wallace
looked
around
him
and
saw
the
space
before
the
keep
filled
with
armed
men
and
citizens
he
ascended
an
elevated
piece
of
ground
which
rose
a
little
to
the
left
and
waving
his
hand
in
token
that
he
intended
to
speak
a
profound
silence
took
place
of
the
buzz
of
admiration
gratitude
and
discontent
he
then
addressed
the
people
brother
soldiers
friends
and
am
i
so
to
distinguish
scots
at
this
word
a
loud
cry
of
perish
all
who
are
the
enemies
of
our
glorious
regent
penetrated
to
the
inmost
chambers
of
the
citadel
believing
that
the
few
of
his
partisans
who
had
ventured
out
were
falling
under
the
vengeance
of
wallace
badenoch
with
a
brandished
weapon
and
followed
by
the
rest
sallied
toward
the
door
but
there
he
stopped
for
he
saw
his
friends
standing
unmolested
wallace
proceeded
and
with
calm
dignity
announced
the
hatred
that
was
now
poured
upon
him
by
a
large
part
of
that
nobility
who
had
been
so
eager
to
invest
him
with
the
high
office
he
then
held
though
they
have
broken
their
oaths
cried
he
i
have
fulfilled
mine
they
vowed
to
me
all
lawful
obedience
i
swore
to
free
scotland
or
to
die
every
castle
in
this
realm
is
restored
to
its
ancient
lord
every
fortress
is
filled
with
a
native
garrison
the
sea
is
covered
with
our
ships
and
the
kingdom
one
in
itself
sits
secure
behind
her
bulwarks
such
have
i
through
the
strength
of
the
almighty
arm
made
scotland
beloved
by
a
grateful
people
i
could
wield
half
her
power
to
the
destruction
of
the
rest
but
i
would
not
pluck
one
stone
out
of
the
building
i
have
raised
i
deliver
up
my
commission
since
its
design
is
accomplished
i
resign
the
regency
as
he
spoke
he
took
off
his
helmet
and
stood
uncovered
before
the
people
no
no
seemed
the
voice
from
every
lip
we
will
acknowledge
no
other
power
we
will
obey
no
other
leader
wallace
expressed
his
sense
of
their
attachment
but
repeating
to
them
that
he
had
fulfilled
the
end
of
his
office
by
setting
them
free
he
explained
that
his
retaining
it
was
no
longer
necessary
should
i
remain
your
regent
continued
he
the
country
would
be
involved
in
ruinous
dissensions
the
majority
of
your
nobles
now
find
a
vice
in
the
virtue
they
once
extolled
and
seeing
its
power
no
longer
needful
seek
to
destroy
my
upholders
with
myself
i
therefore
remove
the
cause
of
contention
i
quit
the
regency
and
i
bequeath
your
liberty
to
the
care
of
your
chiefs
but
should
it
be
again
in
danger
remember
that
while
life
breathes
in
this
heart
the
spirit
of
william
wallace
will
be
with
you
still
with
these
words
he
descended
the
mound
and
mounted
his
horse
amidst
the
cries
and
tears
of
the
populace
they
clung
to
his
garments
as
he
rode
along
and
the
women
with
their
children
throwing
themselves
on
their
knees
in
his
path
implored
him
not
to
leave
them
to
the
inroads
of
a
ravager
not
to
abandon
them
to
the
tyranny
of
their
own
lords
who
unrestrained
by
a
king
or
a
regent
like
himself
would
soon
subvert
his
good
laws
and
reign
despots
over
every
district
in
the
country
wallace
answered
their
entreaties
with
the
language
of
encouragement
adding
that
he
was
not
their
prince
to
lawfully
maintain
a
disputed
power
over
the
legitimate
chiefs
of
the
land
but
he
said
a
rightful
sovereign
may
yet
be
yielded
to
your
prayers
and
to
procure
that
blessing
daughters
of
scotland
night
and
day
invoke
the
giver
of
every
good
gift
when
wallace
and
his
weeping
train
separated
at
the
foot
of
falkirk
hill
he
was
met
by
his
veterans
of
lanark
who
having
heard
of
what
had
passed
in
the
citadel
advanced
to
him
with
one
voice
to
declare
that
they
never
would
fight
under
any
other
commander
wherever
you
are
my
faithful
friends
returned
he
you
shall
still
obey
my
word
when
he
entered
the
monastery
the
opposition
that
was
made
to
his
resignation
of
the
regency
by
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
lord
and
others
was
so
vehement
so
persuasive
that
had
not
wallace
been
steadily
principled
not
to
involve
his
country
in
domestic
war
he
must
have
yielded
to
the
affectionate
eloquence
of
their
pleading
but
showing
to
them
the
public
danger
attendant
on
his
provoking
the
wild
ambition
of
the
cummins
and
their
multitudinous
adherents
his
arguments
which
the
sober
judgment
of
his
friends
saw
conclusive
at
last
ended
the
debate
he
then
rose
saying
i
have
yet
to
perform
my
vow
to
our
lamented
mar
i
shall
seek
his
daughter
and
then
my
brave
companions
you
shall
hear
of
me
and
i
trust
see
me
again

lvi
the
monastery
it
being
lady
ruthven
wish
that
the
remains
of
her
brother
should
be
entombed
with
his
ancestors
preparations
were
made
for
the
mournful
cavalcade
to
set
forth
toward
braemar
castle
the
countess
hoping
that
wallace
might
be
induced
to
accompany
them
did
not
long
object
to
this
proposal
which
lady
ruthven
had
enforced
with
tears
had
any
one
seen
the
tow
and
been
called
upon
to
judge
by
their
deportment
of
the
relationship
in
which
each
lady
stood
to
the
deceased
he
must
have
decided
that
the
sister
was
the
widow
at
the
moment
of
her
death
lady
mar
had
felt
a
shock
she
had
long
looked
for
this
event
as
to
the
seal
of
her
happiness
it
was
the
sight
of
mortality
that
appalled
her
the
man
she
doted
on
nay
even
herself
must
one
day
lie
as
the
object
now
before
her
dead
to
all
earthly
joys
or
pains
but
awake
perhaps
fearfully
awake
to
the
judgments
of
another
world
this
conviction
caused
her
shrieks
when
she
saw
lord
mar
expire
every
obstacle
between
her
and
wallace
she
now
believed
removed
her
husband
was
dead
helen
was
carried
away
by
a
man
devotedly
enamored
of
her
and
most
probably
was
at
that
time
his
wife
the
specters
of
conscience
passed
from
her
eyes
she
no
longer
thought
of
death
and
judgment
and
under
a
pretense
that
her
feelings
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
husband
bier
she
determined
to
seclude
herself
in
her
own
chamber
till
the
freshness
of
wallace
grief
for
his
friend
should
have
passed
away
but
when
she
heard
from
the
indignant
edwin
of
the
rebellious
conduct
of
the
young
lord
badenoch
and
that
the
regent
had
abdicated
her
consternation
superseded
all
caution
i
will
soon
humble
that
proud
boy
exclaimed
she
and
let
him
know
that
in
opposing
the
elevation
of
sir
william
wallace
he
treads
down
his
own
interest
you
are
beloved
by
the
regent
edwin
cried
she
interrupting
herself
and
clasping
his
hand
with
earnestness
teach
his
enthusiastic
heart
the
true
interests
of
his
country
i
am
the
first
woman
of
the
house
of
cummin
and
is
not
that
family
the
most
in
the
kingdom
by
the
adherence
of
one
branch
to
edward
the
battle
of
falkirk
was
lost
by
the
rebellion
of
another
the
regent
of
scotland
is
obliged
to
relinquish
that
dignity
it
is
in
my
power
to
move
the
whole
race
at
my
will
and
if
wallace
would
mingle
his
blood
with
theirs
would
espouse
me
an
overture
which
the
love
i
bear
my
country
impels
me
to
make
every
nerve
would
then
be
strained
to
promote
the
elevation
of
their
nearest
kinswoman
wallace
would
reign
in
scotland
and
the
whole
land
lie
at
peace
family
of
cummin
was
so
powerful
and
numerous
that
an
incredible
number
of
chieftains
of
that
name
attended
the
first
parliament
which
robert
i
held
at
dunstaffnage
castle
the
relationship
between
the
heiress
of
stratheaarn
and
that
family
was
very
near
her
paternal
grandmother
having
been
the
daughter
of
a
lord
edwin
eyed
her
with
astonishment
while
she
spoke
all
her
late
conduct
to
his
cousin
helen
to
his
uncle
and
to
wallace
was
now
explained
and
he
saw
in
her
flushed
cheek
that
it
was
not
the
patriot
who
desired
this
match
but
the
enamored
woman
you
do
not
answer
said
she
have
you
any
apprehension
that
sir
william
wallace
would
reject
the
hand
which
would
give
him
a
crown
which
would
dispense
happiness
to
many
thousand
people
no
replied
he
i
believe
that
much
as
he
is
devoted
to
the
memory
of
her
whom
alone
he
can
ever
love
could
he
purchase
true
happiness
to
scotland
by
the
sacrifice
he
would
espouse
any
virtuous
woman
who
could
bring
him
so
blessed
a
dowry
but
in
your
case
my
honored
aunt
i
can
see
no
probability
of
such
a
consequence
in
the
first
place
i
know
that
now
the
virtuous
earl
of
badenoch
is
no
more
he
neither
respects
nor
fears
the
cummins
and
that
he
would
scorn
to
purchase
a
crown
or
even
the
people
happiness
by
baseness
in
himself
to
rise
by
their
means
who
you
have
seen
will
at
any
time
immolate
all
that
is
sacred
to
man
to
their
own
caprice
or
fancied
interests
would
be
unworthy
of
him
therefore
i
am
sure
if
you
wish
to
marry
sir
william
wallace
you
must
not
urge
the
use
he
may
make
of
the
cummins
as
an
argument
he
need
not
stoop
to
cajole
the
men
he
may
command
did
he
not
drive
the
of
their
clan
with
the
english
host
to
boot
to
seek
any
shelter
from
his
vengeance
and
for
them
in
the
citadel
had
he
chosen
to
give
the
word
they
would
now
be
all
numbered
with
the
dust
aunt
he
has
a
divine
master
whose
example
he
follows
though
in
deep
humility
he
lays
down
his
power
it
is
not
taken
from
him
earthly
crowns
are
dross
to
him
who
looks
for
a
heavenly
one
therefore
honored
lady
believe
it
no
longer
necessary
to
wound
your
delicacy
by
offering
him
a
hand
which
can
not
produce
the
good
you
meditate
the
complexion
of
the
countess
varied
a
thousand
times
during
this
answer
her
reason
assented
to
many
parts
of
it
but
the
passion
she
could
not
acknowledge
to
her
nephew
urged
her
to
persist
you
may
be
right
edwin
she
replied
but
still
as
there
is
nothing
very
repugnant
in
me
the
project
is
surely
worth
trying
at
any
rate
even
setting
the
cummins
aside
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
strathearn
by
allying
your
noble
friend
to
every
illustrious
house
in
the
kingdom
would
make
his
interest
theirs
and
all
must
unit
in
retaining
to
him
the
regency
scotland
will
be
wrecked
should
he
leave
the
helm
and
sweet
edwin
though
your
young
heart
is
yet
unacquainted
with
the
strange
inconsistencies
of
the
tenderest
passion
i
must
whisper
you
that
your
friend
will
never
be
happy
till
he
again
live
in
the
bosom
of
domestic
affection
ah
but
where
is
he
to
find
it
cried
edwin
what
will
ever
restore
his
marion
to
his
arms
i
cried
i
will
be
more
than
ever
marion
was
to
him
she
knew
not
o
she
could
not
the
boundless
love
that
fills
my
heart
for
him
edwin
blushes
at
this
wild
declaration
told
her
how
far
she
had
betrayed
herself
she
attempted
to
palliate
what
she
could
no
longer
conceal
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hand
exclaimed
you
who
love
sir
william
wallace
can
not
be
surprised
that
all
who
adore
human
excellence
should
participate
in
that
sentiment
how
could
i
see
him
the
benefactor
of
my
family
the
blessing
to
all
scotland
and
not
love
him
true
replied
edwin
but
not
as
a
wife
would
love
her
husband
you
were
married
and
was
it
possible
you
could
feel
thus
when
my
uncle
lived
so
strong
a
passion
can
not
have
grown
in
your
breast
since
he
died
for
surely
love
should
not
enter
a
widow
heart
at
the
side
of
an
unburied
husband
edwin
replied
she
you
who
never
felt
the
throbs
of
this
tyrant
judge
with
a
severity
you
will
one
day
regret
when
you
love
and
struggle
with
a
passion
that
drinks
your
very
life
you
will
pity
joanna
of
mar
and
forgive
her
i
pity
you
now
aunt
replied
he
but
you
bewilder
me
i
can
not
understand
the
possibility
of
a
virtuous
married
woman
suffering
any
passion
of
this
kind
to
get
such
domination
over
her
as
to
cause
her
one
guilty
sigh
for
guilty
must
every
wish
be
that
militates
against
the
duty
of
her
marriage
vow
surely
love
comes
not
in
a
whirlwind
to
seize
the
soul
at
once
but
grows
by
degrees
according
to
the
development
of
the
virtues
of
the
object
and
the
freedom
we
give
ourselves
in
their
contemplation
and
if
it
be
virtue
that
you
love
in
sir
william
wallace
had
you
not
virtue
in
your
noble
husband
the
countess
perceived
by
the
remarks
of
edwin
than
he
was
deeper
read
in
the
human
heart
than
she
had
suspected
that
he
was
neither
ignorant
of
the
feelings
of
the
passion
nor
of
what
ought
to
be
its
source
and
therefore
with
a
deep
blush
she
replied
think
for
a
moment
before
you
condemn
me
i
acknowledge
every
good
quality
that
your
uncle
possessed
but
oh
edwin
he
had
frailties
that
you
know
not
of
frailties
that
reduced
me
to
be
what
the
world
never
saw
the
most
unhappy
of
women
edwin
turned
pale
at
this
charge
against
his
uncle
and
while
he
forbore
to
draw
aside
the
veil
which
covered
the
sacred
dead
little
did
he
think
that
the
artful
woman
meant
a
frailty
to
which
she
had
equally
shared
and
the
consequences
of
which
dangerous
vanity
had
constrained
her
to
become
his
wife
she
proceeded
i
married
your
uncle
when
i
was
a
girl
and
knew
not
that
i
had
a
heart
i
saw
wallace
his
virtues
stole
me
from
myself
and
i
found
in
short
edwin
your
uncle
became
of
too
advanced
an
age
to
sympathize
with
my
younger
heart
how
could
i
then
defend
myself
against
the
more
congenial
soul
of
your
friend
he
was
reserved
during
mar
life
but
he
did
not
repulse
me
with
unkindness
i
therefore
hope
and
do
you
my
edwin
gently
influence
him
in
my
favor
and
i
will
forever
bless
you
aunt
answered
he
looking
at
her
attentively
can
you
without
displeasure
hear
me
speak
a
few
perhaps
ungrateful
truths
say
what
you
will
said
she
trembling
only
be
my
advocate
with
the
noblest
of
human
beings
and
i
can
take
naught
amiss
lady
mar
resumed
he
i
answer
you
with
unqualified
sincerity
because
i
love
you
and
venerate
the
memory
of
my
uncle
whose
frailties
whatever
they
might
be
were
visible
to
you
alone
i
answer
you
with
sincerity
because
i
would
spare
you
much
future
pain
and
sir
william
wallace
a
task
that
would
pierce
him
to
the
soul
you
confess
that
he
already
knows
you
love
him
that
he
has
received
such
demonstrations
with
coldness
recollect
what
it
is
you
love
him
for
and
then
judge
if
he
could
do
otherwise
could
he
approve
affections
which
a
wife
transferred
to
him
from
her
husband
and
that
husband
his
friend
ah
but
he
is
now
dead
interrupted
she
that
obstacle
is
removed
but
the
other
which
you
raised
yourself
replied
edwin
while
a
wife
you
showed
to
sir
william
wallace
that
you
could
not
only
indulge
yourself
in
wishes
hostile
to
your
nuptial
faith
but
divulge
them
to
him
ah
my
aunt
what
could
you
look
for
as
the
consequence
of
this
my
uncle
yet
lived
when
you
did
this
and
that
act
were
you
youthful
as
hebe
and
more
tender
than
ever
was
fabled
the
queen
of
love
i
am
sure
the
virtue
of
wallace
would
never
pardon
he
never
could
pledge
his
faith
to
one
whose
passions
had
so
far
silenced
her
sense
of
duty
and
did
he
even
love
you
he
would
not
for
the
empire
of
the
world
repose
his
honor
in
such
keeping
edwin
cired
she
at
last
summoning
power
to
speak
for
during
the
latter
part
of
this
address
she
had
sat
gasping
from
unutterable
disappointment
and
rage
are
you
not
afraid
to
breathe
all
this
to
me
i
have
given
you
my
confidence
and
do
you
abuse
it
do
you
stab
me
when
i
ask
you
to
heal
no
my
dear
aunt
replied
he
i
speak
the
truth
to
you
ungrateful
as
it
is
to
prevent
you
hearing
it
in
perhaps
a
more
painful
form
from
wallace
himself
oh
no
cried
she
with
contemptuous
haughtiness
he
is
a
man
and
he
knows
how
to
pardon
the
excesses
of
love
look
around
you
foolish
boy
and
see
how
many
of
our
proudest
lords
have
united
their
fates
with
women
who
not
only
loved
them
while
their
husbands
lived
but
left
their
homes
and
children
to
join
their
lovers
and
what
is
there
in
me
a
princess
of
the
crowns
of
scotland
and
of
norway
a
woman
who
has
had
the
nobles
of
both
kingdoms
at
her
feet
and
frowned
upon
them
i
should
now
be
contemned
is
the
ingrate
for
whom
alone
i
ever
felt
a
wish
of
love
is
he
to
despise
me
for
my
passion
you
mistake
edwin
you
know
not
the
heart
of
man
not
of
the
common
race
of
men
perhaps
replied
he
but
certainly
that
of
sir
william
wallace
purity
and
he
are
too
sincerely
one
for
personal
vanity
to
blind
his
eyes
to
the
deformity
of
the
passion
you
describe
and
mean
as
i
am
when
compared
with
him
i
must
aver
that
were
a
married
woman
to
love
me
and
seek
to
excuse
her
frailty
i
should
see
alone
her
contempt
of
the
principles
which
are
the
only
impregnable
bulwarks
of
innocence
and
shrink
from
her
as
i
would
from
pollution
then
you
declare
yourself
my
enemy
edwin
no
replied
he
i
speak
to
you
as
a
son
but
if
you
are
determined
to
avow
to
sir
william
wallace
what
you
have
revealed
to
me
i
shall
not
even
observe
on
what
has
passed
but
leave
you
unhappy
lady
to
the
pangs
i
would
have
spared
you
he
rose
lady
mar
wrung
her
hands
in
a
paroxysm
of
conviction
that
what
he
said
was
true
then
edwin
i
must
despair
he
looked
at
her
with
pity
could
you
abhor
the
dereliction
that
your
soul
has
thus
made
from
duty
and
leave
him
whom
your
unwidowed
wishes
now
pursue
to
seek
you
then
i
should
say
that
you
might
be
happy
for
penitence
appeases
god
and
shall
it
not
find
grace
with
man
blessed
edwin
cried
she
falling
on
his
neck
and
kissing
him
whisper
but
my
penitence
to
wallace
teach
him
to
think
i
hate
myself
oh
make
me
that
in
his
eyes
which
you
would
wish
and
i
will
adore
you
on
my
knees
the
door
opened
at
this
moment
and
lord
ruthven
entered
the
tears
she
was
profusely
shedding
on
the
bosom
of
his
son
he
attributed
to
some
conversation
she
might
be
holding
respecting
her
deceased
lord
and
taking
her
hand
he
told
her
he
came
to
propose
her
immediate
removal
from
the
scene
of
so
many
horrors
my
dear
sister
said
he
i
will
attend
you
as
far
as
perth
after
that
edwin
shall
be
your
guard
to
braemar
and
my
janet
will
stay
with
you
there
till
time
has
softened
your
griefs
lady
mar
looked
at
him
and
where
will
be
sir
william
wallace
here
answered
ruthven
some
considerations
consequent
to
his
receiving
the
french
dispatches
will
hold
him
some
time
longer
south
of
the
forth
lady
mar
shook
her
head
doubtfully
and
reminded
him
that
the
chiefs
in
the
citadel
had
withheld
the
dispatches
lord
ruthven
then
informed
her
that
unknown
to
wallace
lord
had
summoned
the
most
powerful
of
his
friends
then
near
stirling
and
attended
by
them
was
carried
on
a
littler
into
the
citadel
it
entered
the
and
from
that
bed
of
honorable
wounds
he
threatened
the
assembly
with
instant
vengeance
from
his
troops
without
unless
they
would
immediately
swear
fealty
to
wallace
and
compel
badenoch
to
give
up
the
french
dispatches
violent
tumults
were
the
consequence
but
litter
being
guarded
by
a
double
rank
of
armed
chieftains
and
the
keep
being
hemmed
round
by
his
men
prepared
to
put
to
the
sword
every
scot
hostile
to
the
proposition
of
their
lord
the
insurgents
at
last
complied
and
forced
badenoch
to
relinquish
the
royal
packet
this
effected
and
his
train
returned
to
the
monastery
wallace
refused
to
resume
the
dignity
he
had
resigned
the
reinvestment
of
which
had
been
extorted
from
the
lords
in
the
citadel
no
said
he
to
it
is
indeed
time
that
i
should
sink
into
shades
where
i
can
not
be
found
since
i
am
become
a
word
of
contention
amongst
my
countrymen
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
continued
ruthven
but
seeing
matter
in
the
french
dispatches
that
ought
to
be
answered
without
delay
he
yet
remains
a
few
days
at
falkirk
then
we
will
await
him
here
cried
the
countess
that
can
not
be
answered
ruthven
it
would
be
against
ecclesiastical
law
to
detain
the
sacred
dead
so
long
from
the
grave
wallace
will
doubtless
visit
braemar
therefore
i
advise
that
you
leave
falkirk
edwin
seconded
this
counsel
and
fearing
to
make
further
opposition
she
silently
acquiesced
but
her
spirit
was
not
so
quiescent
at
night
when
she
went
to
her
cell
her
ever
wakeful
fancy
aroused
a
thousand
images
of
alarm
she
remembered
the
vow
that
wallace
had
made
to
seek
helen
he
had
already
given
up
the
regency
an
office
which
might
have
detained
him
from
such
a
pursuit
and
might
not
a
passion
softer
than
indignation
against
the
ungrateful
chieftains
have
dictated
this
act
should
he
love
helen
what
is
there
not
to
fear
cried
she
and
should
he
meet
her
i
am
undone
racked
by
jealousy
and
goaded
by
contradicting
expectations
she
rose
from
her
bed
and
paced
the
room
in
wild
disorder
one
moment
she
strained
her
mind
to
recollect
every
gracious
look
or
word
from
him
and
then
her
imagination
glowed
with
anticipated
delight
again
she
thought
of
his
address
to
helen
of
his
vow
in
her
favor
and
she
was
driven
to
despair
all
edwin
kind
admonitions
were
forgotten
passion
alone
was
awake
and
forgetful
of
her
rank
and
sex
and
of
her
situation
she
determined
to
see
wallace
and
appeal
to
his
heart
for
the
last
time
she
knew
that
he
slept
in
an
apartment
at
the
other
end
of
the
monastery
and
that
she
might
pass
thither
unobserved
she
glided
into
an
opposite
cell
belonging
to
a
sick
monk
and
stealing
away
his
cloak
threw
it
over
her
and
hurried
along
the
cloisters
the
chapel
doors
were
open
in
passing
she
saw
the
bier
of
her
lord
awaiting
the
hour
of
its
removal
surrounded
by
priests
singing
anthems
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
no
tender
recollections
no
remorse
knocked
at
the
heart
of
lady
mar
as
she
sped
along
abandoned
all
to
thoughts
of
wallace
she
felt
not
that
she
had
a
soul
she
acknowledged
not
that
she
had
a
hope
but
what
centered
in
the
smiles
of
the
man
she
was
hastening
to
seek
his
door
was
fastened
with
a
latch
she
gently
opened
it
and
found
herself
in
his
chamber
she
trembled
she
scarcely
breathed
she
looked
around
she
approached
his
bed
but
he
was
not
there
disappointment
palsied
her
heart
and
she
sunk
upon
a
chair
am
i
betrayed
said
she
to
herself
has
that
youthful
hypocrite
warned
him
hence
and
then
again
she
thought
but
how
should
edwin
guess
that
i
should
venture
here
oh
no
my
cruel
stars
alone
are
against
me
she
now
determined
to
await
his
return
and
nearly
three
hours
she
had
passed
there
enduring
all
the
torments
of
guilt
and
misery
but
he
appeared
not
at
last
hearing
the
matinbell
she
started
up
fearful
that
her
maids
might
discover
her
absence
compelled
by
some
regard
to
reputation
with
an
unwilling
mind
she
left
the
shrine
of
her
idolatry
and
once
more
crossed
the
cloisters
while
again
drawing
toward
the
chapel
she
saw
wallace
himself
issue
from
the
door
supporting
on
his
bosom
the
fainting
head
of
lady
ruthven
edwin
followed
them
lady
mar
pulled
the
monk
cowl
over
her
face
and
withdrew
behind
a
pillar
ah
thought
she
absenting
myself
from
my
duty
i
fled
from
thee
she
listened
with
breathless
attention
to
what
might
be
said
lord
ruthven
met
them
at
that
instant
this
night
watching
by
the
bier
of
her
brother
said
wallace
has
worn
out
your
gentle
lady
we
strove
to
support
her
through
these
sad
vigils
but
at
last
she
sunk
what
ruthven
said
in
reply
when
he
took
his
wife
in
his
arms
the
countess
could
not
hear
but
wallace
answered
i
have
not
seen
her
i
left
her
late
in
the
evening
drowned
in
tears
replied
ruthven
in
a
more
elevated
tone
i
therefore
suppose
that
in
secret
she
offers
those
prayers
for
her
deceased
husband
which
my
tender
janet
pours
over
his
grave
such
tears
replied
wallace
are
heaven
own
balm
i
know
they
purify
the
heart
whence
they
flow
yes
and
the
prayers
we
breathe
for
those
we
love
unite
our
souls
the
closer
to
theirs
look
up
dear
lady
ruthven
said
he
as
she
began
to
revive
look
up
and
hear
how
you
may
while
still
on
earth
retain
the
society
of
your
beloved
brother
seek
his
spirit
at
the
footstool
of
god
is
thus
i
live
sister
of
my
most
venerated
friend
my
soul
is
ever
on
the
wing
of
heaven
whether
in
the
solitary
hour
in
joy
or
in
sorrow
for
theeere
my
treasure
lives
wallace
wallace
cried
lady
ruthven
looking
on
his
animated
countenance
with
wondering
rapture
and
art
thou
a
man
of
earth
and
of
the
sword
oh
rather
say
an
angel
lent
us
here
a
little
while
to
teach
us
to
live
and
to
die
a
glowing
blush
passed
over
the
pale
but
benign
cheek
of
wallace
i
am
a
soldier
of
him
who
was
indeed
brought
into
the
world
to
show
us
by
his
life
and
death
how
to
be
virtuous
and
happy
know
me
by
my
life
to
be
his
follower
and
david
himself
wore
not
a
more
glorious
title
lady
mar
while
she
contemplated
the
matchless
form
before
her
exclaimed
to
herself
why
is
it
animated
by
as
faultless
a
soul
oh
wallace
wert
thou
less
excellent
i
might
hope
but
hell
is
in
my
heart
and
heaven
in
thine
she
tore
her
eyes
from
a
view
which
blasted
while
it
charmed
her
and
rushed
from
the
cloisters
chapter
lvii
durham
the
sun
rose
as
the
funeral
procession
of
the
earl
of
mar
moved
from
before
the
gates
of
the
monastery
at
falkirk
lord
ruthven
and
edwin
mounted
their
horses
the
maids
of
the
two
ladies
led
them
forth
toward
the
litters
which
were
to
convey
them
so
long
a
journey
lady
ruthven
came
first
and
wallace
placed
her
tenderly
in
her
carriage
the
countess
next
appeared
clad
in
the
deep
weeds
of
widowhood
her
child
followed
in
the
arms
of
its
nurse
at
the
sight
of
the
innocent
babe
whom
he
had
so
often
seen
pressed
to
the
fond
bosom
of
the
father
it
was
now
following
to
his
grace
tears
rushed
into
the
eyes
of
wallace
lady
mar
hid
the
tumult
of
her
feelings
on
the
shoulder
of
her
maid
he
advanced
to
her
respectfully
and
handing
her
to
her
vehicle
urged
her
to
cherish
life
for
the
sake
of
her
child
she
threw
herself
with
increased
agitation
on
her
pillow
and
wallace
deeming
the
presence
of
her
babe
the
surest
comforter
laid
it
tenderly
by
her
side
at
that
moment
before
he
had
relinquished
it
she
bent
her
face
upon
his
hands
and
bathing
them
with
tears
faintly
murmured
oh
wallace
remember
me
lord
ruthven
rode
up
to
bid
adieu
to
his
friend
and
the
litters
moved
on
wallace
promised
that
both
he
and
edwin
should
hear
of
him
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
and
affectionately
grasping
the
hand
of
the
latter
bade
him
farewell
hear
of
him
they
should
but
not
see
him
for
it
was
his
determination
to
set
off
that
night
for
durham
where
he
was
informed
edward
now
lay
and
joined
by
his
young
queen
meant
to
sojourn
till
his
wounds
were
healed
believing
that
his
presence
in
scotland
could
no
longer
be
serviceable
and
would
engender
continual
intestine
divisions
wallace
did
not
hesitate
in
fixing
his
course
his
first
object
was
to
fulfill
his
vow
to
lord
mar
he
thought
it
probable
that
helen
might
have
been
carried
to
the
english
court
and
that
in
seeking
her
he
might
also
attempt
an
interview
with
young
bruce
hoping
to
learn
how
far
he
had
succeeded
in
persuading
his
father
to
leave
the
vassalage
of
edward
and
once
more
dare
resuming
the
specter
of
his
ancestors
to
effect
his
plan
without
hinderance
on
the
disappearance
of
the
funeral
cavalcade
wallace
retired
to
his
apartment
to
address
a
letter
to
lord
ruthven
in
this
epistle
he
told
the
chief
that
he
was
going
on
an
expedition
which
he
hoped
would
prove
beneficial
to
his
country
but
it
was
an
enterprise
of
rashness
he
would
not
make
any
one
his
companion
he
therefore
begged
lord
ruthven
to
teach
his
friends
to
consider
with
candor
a
flight
they
might
otherwise
deem
unkind
all
the
brother
was
in
his
letter
to
edwin
conjuring
him
to
prove
his
affection
for
his
friend
by
quietly
abiding
at
home
till
they
should
meet
again
in
scotland
he
wrote
to
andrew
murray
now
lord
bothwell
addressing
him
as
the
first
of
his
compatriots
who
had
struck
a
blow
for
scotland
and
as
his
dear
friend
and
brother
soldier
he
confided
to
his
care
the
valiant
troop
which
had
followed
him
from
lanark
tell
them
said
he
that
in
obeying
you
they
still
serve
with
me
they
perform
their
duty
to
scotland
at
home
i
abroad
our
aim
is
the
same
and
we
shall
meet
again
at
the
consummation
of
our
labors
these
letters
he
inclosed
in
one
to
scrymgeour
with
orders
to
dispatch
two
of
them
according
to
their
directions
but
that
to
murray
scrymgeour
was
himself
to
deliver
at
the
head
of
the
lanark
veterans
at
the
approach
of
twilight
wallace
quitted
the
monastery
leaving
his
packet
with
the
porter
to
present
to
scrymgeour
when
he
should
arrive
at
his
usual
hour
as
the
chief
meant
to
assume
a
garb
that
he
might
travel
the
country
unrecognized
as
its
once
adored
regent
he
took
his
way
toward
a
large
hollow
oak
in
tor
wood
where
he
had
deposited
his
means
of
disguise
when
arrive
there
he
disarmed
himself
of
all
but
his
sword
dirk
and
breastplate
he
covered
his
tartan
gambeson
with
a
minstrel
cassock
and
staining
his
bright
complexion
with
the
juice
of
a
nut
concealed
his
brighter
locks
beneath
a
close
bonnet
being
thus
equipped
he
threw
his
harp
over
his
shoulder
and
having
first
in
that
solitude
where
no
eye
beheld
no
ear
heard
but
that
of
god
invoked
a
blessing
on
his
enterprise
with
a
buoyant
spirit
rejoicing
in
the
power
in
whose
light
he
moved
he
went
forth
and
under
the
sweet
serenity
of
a
summer
night
pursued
his
way
along
the
hills
of
muiravenside
all
lay
in
profound
rest
not
a
human
creature
crossed
his
path
till
the
carol
of
the
lark
summoned
the
husbandman
to
his
toil
and
spread
the
thymy
hills
and
daisied
pastures
with
herds
and
flocks
as
the
lowing
of
cattle
descending
to
the
water
and
the
bleating
of
sheep
hailing
the
morning
beam
came
on
the
breeze
mingled
with
the
joyous
voices
of
their
herdsmen
calling
to
each
other
from
afar
as
all
met
the
ear
of
wallace
his
conscious
heart
could
not
but
whisper
i
have
been
the
happy
instrument
to
effect
this
i
have
restored
every
man
to
his
paternal
fields
i
have
filled
all
these
honest
breasts
with
gladness
he
stopped
at
a
little
cabin
on
the
beneath
craig
castle
in
and
was
hospitably
entertained
by
its
simple
inhabitants
wallace
repaid
their
kindness
with
a
few
ballads
which
he
sung
accompanied
by
his
harp
as
he
gave
the
last
notes
of
king
arthur
death
in
glory
the
worthy
cotter
raised
his
head
from
the
spade
on
which
he
leaned
and
asked
whether
he
could
not
sing
the
glory
of
scotland
our
renowned
wallace
said
he
is
worth
king
arthur
and
all
the
stranger
knights
of
his
round
table
for
he
not
only
conquers
for
us
in
war
but
establishes
us
in
happy
peace
who
like
him
of
all
our
great
captains
ever
took
such
care
of
the
poor
as
to
give
them
not
only
the
bread
which
sustains
temporal
but
that
which
supports
eternal
life
sing
us
then
his
praises
minstrel
and
tarry
with
us
days
instead
of
hours
the
wife
and
the
children
who
clung
around
their
melodious
visitant
joined
in
this
request
wallace
rose
with
a
saddened
smile
and
replied
i
can
not
do
what
you
require
but
i
can
yield
you
an
opportunity
to
oblige
sir
william
wallace
will
you
take
a
letter
from
him
of
which
i
am
the
bearer
to
lord
dundaf
at
berwick
i
have
been
seeking
what
i
have
now
found
a
faithful
scot
with
whom
i
could
confide
this
trust
it
is
to
reveal
to
a
father
heart
the
death
of
a
son
for
whom
scotland
must
mourn
to
her
latest
generations
the
honest
shepherd
respectfully
accepted
this
mission
and
his
wife
loading
her
guest
scrip
with
her
choicest
fruits
and
cakes
accompanied
him
followed
by
the
children
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
in
this
manner
sitting
at
the
board
of
the
lowly
and
sleeping
beneath
the
thatched
roof
did
wallace
pursue
his
way
through
tweedale
and
ettrick
forest
till
he
reached
the
cheviots
from
every
lip
he
heard
his
own
praises
heard
them
with
redoubled
satisfaction
for
he
could
have
no
suspicion
of
their
sincerity
as
they
were
uttered
without
expectation
of
their
ever
reaching
the
regent
ear
it
was
the
sabbath
day
when
he
mounted
the
cheviots
he
stood
on
one
of
their
summits
and
leaning
on
his
harp
contemplated
the
fertile
dales
he
left
behind
the
gay
villagers
in
their
best
attires
were
thronging
to
their
churches
while
the
aged
too
infirm
for
the
walk
were
sitting
in
the
sun
at
their
cottage
doors
adoring
the
almighty
benefactor
in
his
sublimer
temple
of
the
universe
all
spoke
of
security
and
happiness
thus
i
leave
thee
beloved
scotland
and
on
revisiting
these
hills
may
i
still
behold
thy
sons
and
daughters
rejoicing
in
the
peace
of
their
land
having
descended
into
northumberland
his
script
was
his
provider
and
when
it
was
exhausted
he
purchased
food
from
the
peasantry
he
would
not
accept
the
hospitality
of
a
country
he
had
so
lately
trodden
as
an
enemy
here
he
heard
his
name
mentioned
with
terror
as
well
as
admiration
while
many
related
circumstances
of
misery
to
which
the
ravaging
of
their
lands
had
reduced
them
all
concurred
in
praising
the
moderation
with
which
the
scottish
leader
treated
his
conquests
late
in
the
evening
he
arrived
on
the
banks
of
the
river
that
surrounds
the
episcopal
city
of
durham
he
crossed
framlinggate
bridge
his
mistrel
garb
prevented
his
being
stopped
by
the
guard
at
the
gate
but
as
he
entered
its
porch
a
horse
that
was
going
through
started
at
his
abrupt
appearance
its
rider
suddenly
exclaimed
fool
thou
dost
not
see
sir
william
wallace
then
turning
to
the
disguised
knight
harper
cried
he
you
frighten
my
steed
draw
back
till
i
pass
not
displeased
to
find
the
terror
him
so
great
amongst
the
enemies
of
scotland
that
they
even
addressed
their
animals
as
sharers
in
the
dread
wallace
stood
out
of
the
way
and
saw
the
speaker
to
be
a
young
southron
knight
who
with
difficulty
kept
his
seat
on
the
restive
horse
rearing
and
plunging
it
would
have
thrown
its
rider
had
not
wallace
put
forth
his
hand
and
seized
the
bridle
by
his
assistance
the
animal
was
soothed
and
the
young
lord
thanking
him
for
his
service
told
him
that
as
a
reward
he
would
introduce
him
to
play
before
the
queen
who
that
day
held
a
feast
at
the
bishop
palace
wallace
thought
it
probable
he
might
see
or
hear
of
lady
helen
in
this
assembly
or
find
access
to
bruce
and
he
gladly
accepted
the
offer
the
knight
who
was
sir
piers
gaveston
ordering
him
to
follow
turned
his
horse
toward
the
city
and
conducted
wallace
through
the
gates
of
the
citadel
to
the
palace
within
its
walls
on
entering
the
he
was
placed
by
the
knight
in
the
musicians
gallery
there
to
await
his
summons
to
her
majesty
this
entertainment
being
spread
and
the
room
full
of
guests
the
queen
was
led
in
by
the
haughty
bishop
of
the
see
the
king
being
too
ill
of
his
wounds
to
allow
his
joining
so
large
a
company
the
beauty
of
the
lovely
sister
of
philip
le
bel
seemed
to
fill
the
gaze
and
hearts
of
all
bystanders
and
none
appeared
to
remember
that
edward
was
absent
wallace
hardly
glanced
on
her
youthful
charms
his
eyes
roamed
from
side
to
side
in
quest
of
a
fairer
a
dearer
object
the
captive
daughter
of
his
dead
friend
she
was
not
there
neither
was
de
valence
but
buchan
athol
and
soulis
were
near
the
royal
margaret
in
all
the
pomp
of
feudal
grandeur
in
vain
waived
the
trophied
banners
over
their
heads
they
sat
sullen
and
revengeful
for
the
defeat
on
the
carron
had
obscured
the
treacherous
victory
of
falkirk
and
instead
of
having
presented
edward
to
his
young
queen
as
the
conqueror
of
scotland
she
had
found
him
and
them
fugitives
in
the
castle
of
durham
immediately
on
the
royal
band
ceasing
to
play
gaveston
pressed
toward
the
queen
and
told
her
he
had
presumed
to
introduce
a
traveling
minstrel
into
the
gallery
hoping
that
she
would
order
him
to
perform
for
her
amusement
as
he
could
sing
legends
from
the
descent
of
the
romans
to
the
victories
of
her
royal
edward
with
all
her
eagerness
in
quest
of
novelties
she
commanded
him
to
be
brought
to
her
gaveston
having
presented
him
wallace
bowed
with
the
respect
due
to
her
sex
and
dignity
and
to
the
esteem
in
which
he
held
the
character
of
her
royal
brother
margaret
desired
him
to
place
his
harp
before
her
and
begin
to
sing
as
he
knelt
on
one
knee
and
struck
its
sounding
chords
she
stopped
him
by
the
inquiry
of
whence
he
came
from
the
north
country
was
his
reply
were
you
ever
in
scotland
asked
she
many
times
the
young
lords
crowded
round
to
hear
this
dialogue
between
majesty
and
lowliness
she
smiled
and
turned
toward
them
do
not
accuse
me
of
disloyalty
but
i
have
a
curiosity
to
ask
another
question
nothing
your
majesty
wishes
to
know
said
bishop
beck
can
be
amiss
then
tell
me
cried
she
for
you
wandering
minstrels
see
all
great
people
good
or
bad
else
how
could
you
make
songs
about
them
did
you
ever
see
sir
william
wallace
in
your
travels
often
madam
pray
tell
me
what
he
is
like
you
probably
will
be
unprejudiced
and
that
is
what
i
can
hardly
expect
in
this
case
from
any
of
these
brave
lords
wishing
to
avoid
further
questioning
on
this
subject
wallace
replied
i
have
never
seen
him
so
distinctly
as
to
be
enabled
to
prove
any
right
to
your
majesty
opinion
of
my
judgment
can
not
you
sing
me
some
ballad
about
him
inquired
she
laughing
and
if
you
are
a
little
poetical
in
your
praise
i
can
excuse
you
for
my
royal
brother
thinks
this
bold
scot
would
have
shone
brightly
in
a
fairer
cause
my
songs
are
dedicated
to
glory
set
in
the
grave
returned
wallace
therefore
sir
william
wallace
faults
or
virtues
will
not
be
sung
by
me
then
he
is
a
very
young
man
i
suppose
for
you
are
not
old
and
yet
you
speak
of
not
surviving
him
i
was
in
hopes
cried
she
addressing
beck
that
my
lord
the
king
would
have
brought
this
wallace
to
have
supped
with
me
here
but
for
once
rebellion
overcame
its
master
beck
made
some
reply
which
wallace
did
not
hear
and
the
queen
again
turning
to
him
resumed
minstrel
we
french
ladies
are
very
fond
of
a
good
mien
and
i
shall
be
a
little
reconciled
to
your
northern
realms
if
you
tell
me
that
sir
william
wallace
is
anything
like
as
handsome
as
some
of
the
gay
knights
by
whom
you
see
me
surrounded
wallace
smiled
and
replied
the
comeliness
of
sir
william
wallace
lies
in
a
strong
arm
and
a
feeling
heart
and
if
these
be
charms
in
the
eyes
of
female
goodness
he
may
hope
to
be
not
quite
an
object
of
abhorrence
to
the
sister
of
philip
le
bel
the
minstrel
bowed
as
he
spoke
and
the
young
queen
laughing
again
said
i
wish
not
to
come
within
the
influence
of
either
but
sing
me
some
scottish
legend
and
i
will
promise
wherever
i
see
the
knight
to
treat
him
with
all
courtesy
due
to
valor
wallace
again
struck
the
chords
of
his
harp
and
with
a
voice
whose
full
and
melodious
tones
rolled
round
the
vast
dome
of
the
hall
he
sung
the
triumphs
of
beuther
the
queen
fixed
her
eyes
upon
him
and
when
he
ended
she
turned
and
whispered
gavestton
if
the
voice
of
this
man
had
been
wallace
trumpet
i
should
not
now
wonder
at
the
discomfiture
of
england
he
almost
tempted
me
from
my
allegiance
as
the
warlike
animation
of
his
notes
seemed
to
charge
the
flying
southrons
commemoration
of
the
victory
which
this
ancient
scottish
prince
obtained
over
the
britons
before
the
christian
era
the
field
of
conquest
has
ever
since
been
called
rutherglen
speaking
she
rose
and
presenting
a
jeweled
ring
to
the
mistrel
left
the
apartment
the
lords
crowded
out
after
her
and
the
musicians
coming
down
from
the
gallery
seated
themselves
with
much
rude
jollity
to
regale
on
the
remnants
of
the
feast
wallace
who
had
discovered
the
senachie
of
brue
by
the
escutcheon
of
annandale
suspended
at
his
neck
gladly
saw
him
approach
he
came
to
invite
the
stranger
minstrel
to
partake
of
their
fare
wallace
did
not
appear
to
decline
it
and
as
the
court
bard
seemed
rather
devoted
to
the
pleasures
of
wine
he
found
it
not
difficult
to
draw
from
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
he
learned
that
young
bruce
was
still
in
the
castle
under
arrest
and
added
the
senachie
i
shall
feel
no
little
mortification
in
being
obliged
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
to
relinquish
these
festivities
for
the
gloomy
duties
of
his
apartment
this
was
precisely
the
point
to
which
wallace
had
wished
to
lead
him
and
pleading
disrelish
of
wine
he
offered
to
supply
his
place
in
the
earl
chamber
the
bard
accepted
the
proposition
with
eagerness
and
as
the
shades
of
nigh
had
long
closed
in
he
conducted
his
illustrious
substitute
to
the
large
round
tower
of
the
castle
informing
him
as
they
went
along
that
he
must
continue
playing
in
a
recess
adjoining
bruce
room
till
the
last
vesper
bell
from
the
abbey
in
the
neighborhood
should
give
the
signal
for
his
laying
aside
the
harp
at
that
time
the
earl
would
be
fallen
asleep
and
he
might
then
lie
down
on
a
pallet
he
would
find
in
the
recess
all
this
wallace
promised
punctually
to
obey
and
being
conducted
by
the
senachie
up
a
spiral
staircase
was
left
in
the
little
anteroom
the
chief
drew
the
cowl
of
his
minstrel
cloak
over
his
face
and
set
his
harp
before
him
in
order
to
play
he
could
see
through
its
strings
that
a
group
of
knights
were
in
earnest
conversation
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
but
they
spoke
so
low
he
could
not
distinguish
what
was
said
one
of
the
party
turned
round
and
the
light
of
a
suspended
lamp
discovered
him
to
be
the
brave
earl
gloucester
whom
wallace
had
taken
and
released
at
berwick
the
same
ray
showed
another
to
be
percy
earl
of
northumberland
wallace
found
the
strangeness
of
his
situation
he
the
conqueror
of
edward
to
have
been
singing
as
a
mendicant
in
his
halls
and
having
given
laws
to
the
two
great
men
before
him
he
now
sat
in
their
view
unobserved
and
unfeared
their
figures
concealed
that
of
bruce
but
at
last
when
all
rose
together
he
heard
gloucester
say
in
rather
an
elevated
voice
keep
up
your
spirits
this
envy
of
your
base
countrymen
must
recoil
upon
themselves
it
can
not
be
long
before
king
edward
discovers
the
motives
of
their
accusations
and
his
noble
nature
will
acquit
you
accordingly
my
acquittal
replied
bruce
in
a
firm
tone
can
not
restore
what
edward
injustice
has
rifled
from
me
i
abide
by
the
test
of
my
own
actions
and
by
it
will
open
the
door
of
my
freedom
your
king
may
depend
on
it
added
he
with
a
sarcastic
smile
that
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
influenced
against
the
right
where
i
owe
duty
i
will
pay
it
to
the
uttermost
farthing
not
apprehending
the
true
meaning
of
this
speech
percy
immediately
answered
i
believe
you
and
so
must
all
that
world
for
did
you
not
give
brave
proofs
of
it
that
fearful
night
on
the
carron
in
bearing
arms
against
the
triumphant
wallace
i
did
indeed
give
proofs
of
it
returned
bruce
which
i
hope
the
world
will
one
day
know
by
bearing
arms
against
the
usurper
of
my
country
rights
and
in
defiance
of
injustice
and
of
treason
before
men
and
angels
i
swear
cried
he
to
perform
my
duty
to
the
end
to
retrieve
to
honor
the
insulted
the
degraded
name
of
bruce
the
two
earls
fell
back
before
the
vehement
action
which
accompanied
this
burst
from
the
soul
of
bruce
and
wallace
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
youthful
form
which
stood
in
patriotic
virtue
between
the
southron
lords
his
fine
countenance
glowed
and
his
brave
spirit
seemed
to
emanate
in
light
from
every
part
of
his
body
my
prince
and
brother
exclaimed
wallace
to
himself
ready
to
rush
forward
and
throw
himself
at
his
feet
or
into
his
arms
gloucester
as
little
as
northumberland
comprehending
ambiguous
declaration
replied
let
not
your
heart
my
brave
friend
burn
too
hotly
against
the
king
for
this
arrest
he
will
be
the
more
urgent
to
obliterate
by
kindness
this
injustice
when
he
understands
the
aims
of
the
cummins
i
have
myself
felt
his
misplaced
wrath
and
who
now
is
more
favored
by
edward
than
ralph
de
monthermer
my
case
will
be
yours
good
night
bruce
may
propitious
dreams
repeat
the
augury
of
your
true
friends
percy
shook
hands
with
the
young
earl
and
the
two
english
lords
left
the
room
wallace
could
now
take
a
more
leisurely
survey
of
bruce
he
no
longer
wore
gay
embroidered
hacqueton
his
tunic
was
black
velvet
and
all
the
rest
of
his
garments
accorded
with
the
same
mourning
hue
soon
after
the
lords
had
quitted
him
the
buoyant
elasticity
of
his
figure
which
before
seemed
ready
to
rise
from
the
earth
so
was
his
soul
elevated
by
his
sublime
resolves
gave
way
to
melancholy
retrospections
and
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
his
knee
and
his
eyes
fixed
in
musing
gaze
upon
the
floor
it
was
now
that
wallace
touched
the
strings
of
his
harp
the
death
of
cathullin
wailed
from
the
sounding
notes
but
bruce
heard
as
though
he
heard
them
not
they
sooth
his
mood
without
his
perceiving
what
it
was
that
calmed
yet
deepened
the
saddening
thoughts
which
possessed
him
his
posture
remained
the
same
and
sigh
after
sigh
gave
the
only
response
to
the
strains
of
the
bard
wallace
grew
impatient
for
the
chimes
of
that
vesper
bell
which
by
assuring
bruce
attendants
that
he
was
going
to
rest
would
secure
from
interruption
the
conference
he
meditated
two
servants
entered
bruce
scarcely
looking
up
bade
them
withdraw
he
should
not
need
their
attendance
he
did
not
know
when
he
should
go
to
bed
and
he
desired
to
be
no
further
disturbed
the
men
obeyed
and
wallace
changing
the
melancholy
strain
of
his
harp
struck
the
chords
to
the
proud
triumph
he
had
played
in
the
hall
not
one
note
of
either
ballad
had
he
yet
sung
to
bruce
but
when
he
came
to
the
passage
in
the
latter
appropriated
to
these
lines
arise
glory
of
albin
from
thy
cloud
and
shine
upon
thy
own
he
could
not
forbear
giving
the
words
voice
bruce
started
from
his
seat
he
looked
toward
the
minstrel
he
walked
the
room
in
great
disorder
the
pealing
sounds
of
the
harp
and
his
own
mental
confusion
prevented
his
distinguishing
that
it
was
not
the
voice
of
his
senachie
the
words
alone
he
heard
and
they
seemed
a
call
which
his
heart
panted
to
obey
the
hand
of
wallace
paused
upon
the
instrument
he
looked
around
to
see
that
observation
was
indeed
at
a
distance
not
that
he
dreaded
harm
to
himself
for
his
magnanimous
mind
courageous
from
infancy
by
a
natural
instinct
had
never
known
personal
fear
but
anxious
not
to
precipitate
bruce
into
useless
danger
he
first
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
safe
and
then
as
the
young
earl
sat
in
a
paroxysm
of
racking
reflections
for
they
brought
or
rather
a
blame
on
his
father
which
pierced
him
to
the
heart
wallace
slowly
advanced
from
the
recess
the
agitated
bruce
accidentally
raising
his
head
beheld
a
man
in
a
minstrel
garb
much
to
tall
to
be
his
senachie
approaching
him
with
a
caution
which
he
thought
portended
treachery
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
caught
his
sword
from
the
table
but
in
that
moment
wallace
threw
off
his
cowl
bruce
stood
gazing
on
him
stiffened
with
astonishment
wallace
in
a
low
voice
exclaimed
my
prince
do
you
not
know
me
bruce
without
speaking
threw
his
arms
about
his
neck
he
was
silent
as
he
hung
on
him
but
his
tears
flowed
he
had
much
to
say
but
excess
of
emotion
rendered
it
unutterable
as
wallace
returned
the
fond
embrace
of
friendship
he
gently
said
how
is
it
that
i
not
only
see
you
a
close
prisoner
but
in
these
weeds
bruce
at
last
forced
himself
to
articulate
i
have
known
misery
in
all
its
forms
since
we
parted
but
i
have
not
power
to
name
even
my
grief
of
griefs
while
trembling
at
the
peril
to
which
you
have
exposed
yourself
by
seeking
me
the
vanquisher
of
edward
the
man
who
snatched
scotland
from
his
grasp
were
he
known
to
be
within
these
walls
would
be
a
prize
for
which
the
boiling
revenge
of
the
tyrant
would
give
half
his
kingdom
think
then
my
friend
how
i
shudder
at
this
daring
i
am
surrounded
by
spies
and
should
you
be
discovered
robert
bruce
will
then
have
the
curses
of
his
country
added
to
the
judgments
which
already
have
fallen
on
his
head
as
he
spoke
they
sat
down
together
and
he
continued
before
i
answer
your
questions
tell
me
what
immediate
cause
could
bring
you
to
seek
the
alien
bruce
in
prison
and
by
what
stratagem
you
came
in
this
disguise
into
my
apartment
tell
me
the
last
that
i
may
judge
by
the
means
of
your
present
safety
wallace
briefly
related
the
events
which
had
sent
him
from
scotland
his
reencounter
with
piers
gaveston
and
his
arrangement
with
the
senachie
to
the
first
part
of
the
narrative
bruce
listened
with
indignation
i
knew
exclaimed
he
from
the
boastings
of
athol
and
buchan
that
they
had
left
in
scotland
some
dregs
of
heir
own
refractory
spirits
but
i
could
not
have
guessed
that
envy
had
so
obliterated
gratitude
in
the
hearts
of
my
countrymen
the
wolves
have
now
driven
the
shepherd
from
the
fold
cried
he
and
the
flock
will
soon
be
devoured
fatal
was
the
hour
for
scotland
and
your
friend
when
you
yielded
to
the
voice
of
faction
and
relinquished
the
power
which
would
have
finally
given
peace
to
the
nation
wallace
recapitulated
his
reasons
for
having
refrained
from
forcing
the
obedience
of
the
young
lord
badenoch
and
his
adherents
for
abdicating
a
dignity
he
could
no
longer
maintain
without
shedding
the
blood
of
the
misguided
men
who
opposed
him
bruce
acknowledged
the
wisdom
of
this
conduct
but
could
not
restrain
his
animadversions
on
the
characters
of
the
cummins
he
told
wallace
that
he
had
met
the
two
sons
of
the
late
lord
badenoch
in
guienne
that
james
who
now
pretended
such
resentment
of
his
father
death
had
ever
been
a
rebellious
son
john
who
yet
remained
in
france
appeared
of
a
less
violent
temper
but
added
the
prince
i
have
been
taught
by
one
who
will
never
counsel
me
more
that
all
the
cummins
male
and
female
would
be
ready
at
any
time
to
sacrifice
earth
and
heaven
to
their
ambition
it
is
to
buchan
and
athol
that
i
owe
my
prolonged
confinement
and
to
them
i
may
date
the
premature
death
of
my
father
the
start
of
wallace
declared
his
shock
at
this
information
how
exclaimed
he
the
earl
of
carrick
dead
fell
fell
assassins
of
their
country
the
swelling
emotions
of
his
soul
would
not
allow
him
to
proceed
and
bruce
resumed
it
is
for
him
i
wear
these
sable
garments
poor
emblems
of
the
mournings
of
my
soul
mournings
not
so
much
for
his
loss
and
that
is
grievous
as
ever
son
bore
but
because
he
lived
not
to
let
the
world
know
what
he
really
was
he
lived
not
to
bring
into
light
his
honor
there
there
wallace
is
the
bitterness
of
this
cup
to
me
but
can
you
not
sweeten
it
my
dear
prince
cried
wallace
by
retrieving
all
that
he
was
cut
off
from
redeeming
to
open
the
way
to
you
i
come
and
i
will
enter
where
you
point
returned
bruce
but
heavy
is
my
woe
that
knowing
the
same
spirit
was
in
my
father
bosom
he
should
be
torn
from
the
opportunity
to
make
it
manifest
oh
wallace
that
he
should
be
made
to
lie
down
in
a
dishonored
grave
had
he
lived
my
friend
he
would
have
brightened
that
name
which
rumor
has
sullied
and
i
should
have
doubly
gloried
in
wearing
the
name
he
had
rendered
so
worthy
of
being
coupled
with
the
kingly
title
noble
was
he
in
soul
but
he
fell
amidst
a
race
of
men
whose
art
was
equal
to
their
venality
and
he
became
their
dupe
betrayed
by
friendship
he
sunk
into
the
snare
for
he
had
no
dishonor
in
his
own
breast
to
warn
him
of
what
might
be
the
villainy
of
others
he
believed
the
cajoling
speeches
of
edward
who
on
the
first
offense
of
baliol
had
promised
to
place
my
father
on
the
throne
month
after
month
passed
away
and
the
engagement
was
unperformed
the
disturbance
on
the
continent
seemed
to
his
confiding
nature
a
sufficient
excuse
for
these
various
delays
and
he
waited
in
quiet
expectation
till
your
name
my
friend
rose
glorious
in
scotland
my
father
and
myself
were
then
in
guienne
edward
persuaded
him
that
you
affected
the
crown
and
he
returned
with
that
deceiver
to
draw
his
sword
against
his
people
and
their
ambitious
idol
for
so
he
believed
you
to
be
and
grievous
has
been
the
expiation
of
that
fatal
hour
your
conference
with
him
on
the
banks
of
the
carron
opened
his
eyes
he
saw
what
his
credulity
had
made
scotland
suffer
what
a
wreck
he
had
made
of
his
own
fame
and
from
that
moment
he
resolved
to
follow
another
course
but
the
habit
of
trusting
the
affection
of
edward
inclined
him
rather
to
remonstrate
on
his
rights
than
immediately
to
take
up
arms
against
him
yet
resolved
not
to
strike
a
second
blow
on
his
people
when
you
assailed
the
southron
camp
he
withdrew
his
few
remaining
followers
who
had
survived
the
day
of
falkirk
into
a
remote
defile
on
quitting
you
i
came
up
with
him
in
and
never
having
missed
me
from
the
camp
he
concluded
that
i
had
appeared
thus
late
from
having
kept
in
the
rear
of
the
division
bruce
now
proceeded
to
narrate
to
wallace
the
particulars
of
his
father
meeting
with
the
king
at
durham
instead
of
that
monarch
receiving
the
earl
of
carrick
with
his
wonted
familiar
welcome
he
turned
coldly
from
him
when
he
approached
and
suffered
him
to
take
his
usual
seat
at
the
royal
table
without
deigning
him
the
slightest
notice
young
bruce
was
absent
from
the
banquet
having
determined
never
to
mingle
again
in
social
communion
with
the
man
whom
he
now
regarded
as
the
usurper
of
his
father
rights
the
absence
of
the
filial
eye
which
had
once
looked
the
insolent
buchan
into
his
inherent
insignificance
now
emboldened
the
audacity
of
this
enemy
of
the
house
of
carrick
and
supported
by
athol
on
the
one
side
and
soulis
on
the
other
the
base
voluptuary
seized
a
pause
in
the
conversation
that
he
might
draw
the
attention
of
all
present
to
the
disgrace
of
the
chief
and
said
with
affected
carelessness
my
lord
of
carrick
you
dine
with
clean
hands
the
last
time
i
saw
you
at
meat
they
were
garnished
with
your
own
blood
the
earl
turned
on
him
a
look
which
asked
him
to
explain
lord
buchan
laughed
and
continued
when
we
last
met
at
table
was
it
not
in
his
majesty
tent
after
the
victory
at
falkirk
you
were
then
red
from
the
slaughter
of
those
bastardized
people
to
whom
i
understand
you
now
give
the
fond
appellation
of
sons
having
recognized
the
relationship
it
was
not
probable
we
should
again
see
your
hands
in
their
former
brave
livery
and
their
present
pallid
hue
convinces
more
than
myself
of
the
truth
of
our
information
and
me
cried
edward
rising
on
the
couch
to
which
his
wounds
confined
him
that
i
have
discovered
a
traitor
you
fled
lord
carrick
at
the
first
attack
which
the
scots
made
on
my
camp
and
you
drew
thousands
after
you
i
know
you
too
well
to
believe
that
cowardice
impelled
the
motion
it
was
treachery
accursed
treachery
to
your
friend
and
king
and
you
shall
feel
the
weight
of
his
resentment
to
this
hour
kind
edward
replied
the
earl
starting
from
his
chair
i
have
been
more
faithful
to
you
than
to
my
country
or
my
god
i
heard
saw
and
believed
only
what
you
determined
and
i
became
your
slave
your
vile
oppressed
slave
the
victim
of
your
artifice
how
often
have
you
pledged
yourself
that
you
fought
in
scotland
only
for
my
advantage
i
gave
my
faith
and
my
power
to
you
and
how
often
have
you
promised
after
the
next
successful
battle
to
restore
me
to
the
crown
of
my
ancestors
i
still
believed
you
and
i
still
engaged
all
who
yet
acknowledged
the
influence
of
bruce
to
support
your
name
in
scotland
was
not
such
the
reiterated
promise
by
which
you
allured
me
to
the
field
of
falkirk
and
when
i
had
covered
myself
as
lord
buchan
too
truly
says
with
the
blood
of
my
children
when
i
asked
my
friend
for
the
crown
i
had
served
for
what
was
his
answer
i
naught
to
do
but
to
win
kingdoms
to
make
gifts
of
thus
then
did
a
king
a
friend
break
his
word
what
wonder
then
that
i
should
feel
the
indignation
of
a
prince
and
a
friend
and
leave
the
false
alas
the
perjured
to
defenders
whom
he
seemed
more
highly
to
approve
but
of
treachery
what
have
i
shown
rather
confidence
king
edward
and
the
confidence
that
was
awakened
in
the
fields
of
palestine
brought
me
hither
to
remonstrate
with
you
on
my
rights
when
by
throwing
myself
into
the
arms
of
my
people
i
might
have
demanded
them
at
the
head
of
a
victorious
army
edward
who
had
prepared
by
the
cummins
to
discredit
all
that
carrick
might
say
in
his
defense
turned
with
a
look
of
contempt
toward
him
and
said
you
have
persuaded
to
act
like
a
madman
and
as
maniacs
both
yourself
and
your
son
shall
be
guarded
till
i
have
leisure
to
consider
any
rational
evidence
you
may
in
future
offer
in
your
vindication
and
is
this
the
manner
king
edward
that
you
treat
your
friend
once
your
preserver
the
vassal
replied
edward
who
presumes
upon
the
condescension
of
his
prince
and
acts
as
if
he
were
really
his
equal
ought
to
meet
the
punishment
due
to
such
arrogance
you
saved
my
life
on
the
walls
of
acre
but
you
owed
that
duty
to
the
son
of
your
liege
lord
in
the
fervor
of
youth
i
inconsiderately
rewarded
you
with
my
friendship
and
the
return
is
treason
as
he
concluded
he
turned
from
lord
carrick
and
the
marshals
immediately
seizing
the
earl
took
him
to
the
keep
of
the
castle
speeches
are
historically
true
as
is
also
of
the
earl
of
carrick
his
son
who
had
been
sought
in
the
carrick
quarters
and
laid
under
an
arrest
met
his
father
in
the
carrick
could
not
speak
but
motioning
to
be
conducted
to
the
place
appointed
for
his
prison
the
men
with
equal
silence
led
him
through
a
range
of
apartments
which
occupied
the
middle
story
and
stopping
in
the
furthest
left
him
there
with
his
son
bruce
was
not
surprised
at
his
own
arrest
but
at
that
of
his
father
he
stood
in
speechless
astonishment
until
the
guards
withdrew
then
seeing
lord
carrick
with
a
changing
countenance
throw
himself
on
the
bed
for
it
was
in
his
sleeping
room
they
had
left
him
he
exclaimed
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
my
father
has
any
charge
against
me
brought
suspicion
on
you
no
robert
no
replied
the
earl
it
is
i
who
have
brought
you
into
this
prison
and
into
disgrace
disgrace
with
all
the
world
for
having
tacitly
surrendered
my
inheritance
to
the
invader
of
my
country
honest
men
abhor
villains
treat
me
with
contumely
and
he
for
whom
i
incurred
all
this
because
i
would
not
when
my
eyes
were
open
to
my
sin
again
imbrue
my
hands
in
the
blood
of
my
country
now
thrusts
me
from
him
you
are
implicated
in
my
crime
and
for
not
joining
the
southrons
to
repel
the
scots
from
the
royal
camp
we
are
both
prisoners
then
replied
bruce
he
shall
feel
that
you
have
a
son
who
has
virtue
to
be
what
he
suspects
and
from
this
hour
i
proclaim
eternal
enmity
to
the
betrayer
of
my
father
to
the
ingrate
who
embraced
you
to
destroy
the
indignation
of
the
youthful
prince
wrought
him
to
so
vehement
a
declaration
of
resolute
and
immediate
hostility
that
lord
carrick
was
obliged
to
give
his
transports
way
but
when
he
saw
that
his
denunciations
were
exhausted
though
not
the
determined
purpose
of
his
soul
for
he
trod
the
room
with
a
step
which
seemed
to
shake
its
foundations
with
the
power
of
his
mighty
mind
carrick
gazed
on
him
with
pride
yet
grief
and
sighing
heavily
called
him
to
approach
him
come
to
me
my
robert
said
he
hear
and
abide
by
the
last
injunctions
of
your
father
for
from
this
bed
i
may
never
rise
more
a
too
late
sense
of
the
injuries
my
sanction
has
doubled
on
the
people
i
was
born
to
protect
and
the
ingratitude
of
him
for
whom
i
have
offended
my
god
and
wronged
my
country
have
broken
my
heart
i
shall
die
robert
but
you
will
avenge
me
may
god
so
prosper
me
cried
bruce
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
carrick
resumed
attend
to
me
my
dear
and
brave
son
and
do
not
mistake
the
nature
of
my
last
wish
do
not
allow
the
perhaps
too
forcible
word
i
have
used
to
hurry
you
into
any
personal
revenge
on
edward
let
him
live
to
feel
and
to
regret
the
outrages
he
has
committed
on
the
peace
and
honor
of
his
too
faithful
friend
pierce
him
on
the
side
of
his
ambition
there
he
is
vulnerable
and
there
you
will
heal
while
you
wound
this
would
be
my
revenge
dear
robert
that
you
should
one
day
have
his
life
in
your
power
and
in
memory
of
what
i
now
say
spare
it
when
i
am
gone
think
not
of
private
resentment
let
your
aim
be
the
recovery
of
the
kingdom
which
edward
rifled
from
your
fathers
join
the
virtuous
and
triumphant
wallace
tell
him
of
my
remorse
of
my
fate
and
be
guided
wholly
by
his
counsels
to
insure
the
success
of
this
enterprise
my
son
a
success
to
which
i
look
as
to
the
only
means
of
redeeming
the
name
i
have
lost
and
of
inspiring
my
separated
spirit
with
courage
to
meet
the
freeborn
souls
of
my
ancestors
urge
not
your
own
destruction
by
any
premature
disclosure
of
your
resolutions
for
my
sake
and
for
your
country
suppress
your
resentment
threaten
not
the
king
of
england
provoke
not
the
unworthy
scottish
lords
who
have
gained
his
ear
but
bury
all
in
your
own
bosom
till
you
can
join
wallace
then
by
his
arm
and
your
own
seat
yourself
firmly
on
the
throne
of
your
fathers
that
moment
will
sufficiently
avenge
me
on
edward
and
in
that
moment
robert
or
at
least
as
soon
as
circumstances
can
allow
let
the
english
ground
which
will
then
hold
my
body
give
up
its
dead
remove
me
to
a
scottish
grave
and
standing
over
my
ashes
proclaim
to
them
who
might
have
been
my
people
that
for
every
evil
i
suffered
to
fall
on
scotland
i
have
since
felt
answering
pangs
and
that
dying
i
beg
their
forgiveness
and
bequeath
them
my
best
blessing
my
virtuous
son
to
reign
in
my
stead
these
injunctions
to
assert
his
own
honor
and
that
of
his
father
were
readily
sworn
to
by
bruce
but
he
could
not
so
easily
be
made
to
quell
the
imperious
indignation
which
was
precipitating
him
to
an
immediate
and
loud
revenge
the
dying
earl
trembled
before
the
overwhelming
passion
of
his
son
wrath
and
grief
treated
with
outrage
and
contumely
he
saw
his
father
stricken
to
the
earth
before
him
and
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
any
temporizing
with
his
murderers
but
all
this
tempest
of
the
soul
the
arguments
of
the
earl
at
last
becalmed
but
could
not
subdue
he
convinced
his
son
reason
by
showing
him
that
caution
would
insure
the
blow
and
that
his
aim
could
only
be
effected
by
remaining
silent
till
he
could
publish
his
honor
evidenced
by
his
own
heroism
do
this
added
carrick
and
i
shall
live
fair
in
the
memories
of
men
but
be
violent
threaten
edward
from
these
walls
menace
the
wretches
who
have
trodden
on
the
gray
hairs
of
their
prince
and
your
voice
will
be
heard
no
more
this
ground
will
drink
your
blood
and
blindly
judging
infamy
will
forever
after
point
to
our
obscure
graves
such
persuasives
at
last
prevailed
with
bruce
and
next
day
writing
the
hasty
lines
which
wallace
received
at
falkirk
he
intrusted
them
to
his
senachie
who
conveyed
them
to
scotland
by
means
of
the
shepherd
youth
shortly
after
the
dispatch
of
this
letter
the
presage
of
lord
carrick
was
verified
he
was
seized
in
the
night
with
spasms
and
died
in
the
arms
of
his
son
when
bruce
related
these
particulars
his
grief
and
indignation
became
so
violent
that
wallace
was
obliged
to
enforce
the
dying
injunctions
of
the
father
he
thus
vehemently
deplored
to
moderate
the
delirium
of
his
soul
ah
exclaimed
the
young
earl
i
have
indeed
needed
some
friend
to
save
me
from
myself
some
one
to
reconcile
me
to
the
robert
bruce
who
had
so
long
slept
in
the
fatal
delusions
which
poisoned
his
father
and
laid
him
low
oh
wallace
at
times
i
am
mad
i
know
not
whether
this
forbearance
be
not
cowardice
i
doubt
whether
my
father
meant
what
he
spoke
that
he
did
not
yet
seek
to
preserve
the
life
of
his
son
at
the
expense
of
his
honor
and
i
have
been
ready
to
precipitate
myself
on
the
steel
of
edward
so
that
he
should
but
meet
the
point
of
mine
bruce
then
added
that
in
his
more
rational
meditations
he
had
resolved
to
attempt
an
escape
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
understood
that
a
deputation
of
english
barons
seeking
a
ratification
of
their
charter
were
soon
to
arrive
in
durham
the
bustle
attendant
on
their
business
would
he
hoped
draw
attention
from
him
and
afford
him
the
opportunity
he
sought
in
that
case
continued
he
i
should
have
made
directly
to
stirling
and
had
not
providence
conducted
you
to
me
i
might
have
unconsciously
thrown
myself
into
the
midst
of
enemies
james
cummin
is
too
ambitious
to
have
allowed
my
life
to
pass
unattempted
whilst
he
was
yet
speaking
the
door
of
the
chamber
burst
open
and
bruce
two
attendants
rushed
into
the
room
with
looks
aghast
bruce
and
wallace
started
on
their
feet
and
laid
their
hands
on
their
swords
but
instead
of
anything
hostile
appearing
behind
the
servants
the
inebriated
figure
of
the
senachie
staggered
forward
the
men
hardly
awake
stood
staring
and
trembling
and
looking
from
the
senachie
to
wallace
at
last
one
extricating
his
tongue
and
falling
on
his
knees
exclaimed
blessed
andrew
here
is
the
senachie
and
his
wraith
bruce
perceived
the
mistake
of
his
servants
and
explaining
to
them
that
a
traveling
minstrel
had
obliged
the
senachie
by
performing
his
duty
he
bade
them
retire
to
rest
and
think
no
more
of
their
alarm
the
intoxicated
bard
threw
himself
without
ceremony
on
his
pallet
in
the
recess
and
the
servants
though
convinced
still
shaking
with
superstitious
fright
entreated
permission
to
bring
their
heather
beds
into
their
lord
chamber
to
deny
them
was
impossible
and
all
further
converse
with
wallace
that
night
being
put
an
end
to
a
couch
was
laid
for
him
in
an
interior
apartment
and
with
a
grateful
pressure
of
the
hands
in
which
their
hearts
silently
embraced
the
chiefs
separated
to
repose
chapter
lviii
the
bishop
palace
the
second
matin
bell
sounded
from
the
abbey
before
the
eyes
of
wallace
opened
from
the
deep
sleep
which
had
sealed
them
a
bath
refreshed
him
from
every
toil
then
renewing
the
stain
on
his
face
and
hands
with
the
juice
of
a
nut
which
he
carried
about
him
and
once
more
covering
his
martial
figure
and
golden
hair
with
the
minstrel
cassock
and
cowl
he
rejoined
his
friend
bruce
had
previously
affected
to
consider
the
senachie
as
still
disordered
by
his
last
night
excess
and
ordering
him
from
his
presence
for
at
least
a
day
commanded
that
the
traveling
minstrel
should
be
summoned
to
supply
his
place
the
table
was
spread
when
wallace
entered
and
several
servants
were
in
attendance
bruce
hastily
rose
and
would
have
embraced
him
so
did
his
comforted
heart
spring
to
meet
his
friend
but
before
these
people
it
would
have
been
more
than
imprudent
and
hailing
him
with
only
one
of
his
looks
he
made
a
sign
to
him
to
take
his
place
at
a
board
near
his
own
to
prevent
suspicioin
in
the
attendants
some
of
whom
might
be
spies
of
edward
during
the
repast
he
discoursed
with
wallace
on
subjects
relative
to
northern
literature
repeating
many
passages
apposite
to
his
own
heroic
sentiments
from
ossian
and
other
scottish
bards
the
meal
finished
wallace
to
maintain
his
assumed
character
while
the
servants
were
removing
the
table
was
tuning
his
harp
when
the
earl
of
gloucester
entered
the
room
the
earl
told
bruce
the
king
had
required
the
attendance
of
the
border
minstrel
and
that
after
searching
over
the
castle
the
royal
seneschal
had
at
last
discovered
he
was
in
the
keep
with
him
on
this
being
intimated
to
gloucester
he
chose
rather
to
come
himself
to
demand
the
harper
from
his
friend
than
to
subject
him
to
the
insolence
of
the
royal
servants
the
king
desired
to
hear
the
triumph
with
which
the
minstrel
had
so
much
pleased
the
queen
bruce
turned
pale
at
this
message
and
was
opening
his
mouth
to
utter
a
denial
when
wallace
who
read
in
his
countenance
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
aware
of
the
consequences
immediately
spoke
if
my
lord
bruce
will
grant
permission
i
should
wish
to
comply
with
the
king
of
england
request
minstrel
replied
bruce
casting
on
him
a
powerful
expression
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
you
know
not
perhaps
that
the
king
of
england
is
at
enmity
with
me
and
can
not
mean
well
to
any
one
who
has
been
my
guest
or
servant
the
earl
of
gloucester
will
excuse
your
attendance
in
the
presence
not
for
my
life
or
the
minstrel
replied
the
earl
the
king
would
suspect
some
mystery
and
this
innocent
man
might
fall
into
peril
but
as
it
is
his
majesty
merely
wishes
to
hear
him
play
and
sing
and
i
pledge
myself
he
shall
return
in
safety
further
opposition
would
only
have
courted
danger
and
with
as
good
a
grace
as
he
could
assume
bruce
gave
his
consent
a
page
who
followed
gloucester
took
up
the
harp
and
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
which
spoke
the
fearless
mind
with
which
he
ventured
into
the
power
of
his
enemy
wallace
accompanied
gloucester
out
of
the
room
the
earl
moved
swiftly
forward
and
leading
him
through
a
double
line
of
guards
the
of
the
royal
apartment
were
thrown
open
by
two
knights
in
waiting
and
wallace
found
himself
in
the
royal
presence
perforated
with
wounds
which
the
chief
own
hand
had
given
him
the
king
lay
upon
a
couch
overhung
with
a
canopy
with
long
golden
fringes
which
swept
the
floor
his
crown
stood
on
a
cushion
at
his
head
and
his
queen
the
blooming
margaret
of
france
sat
full
of
smiles
at
his
feet
the
young
countess
of
gloucester
occupied
a
seat
by
her
side
the
countess
who
from
indisposition
had
not
been
at
court
the
preceding
day
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
minstrel
as
he
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
where
the
page
by
gloucester
orders
planted
the
harp
she
observed
the
manner
of
his
obeisance
to
the
king
and
queen
and
to
herself
and
the
queen
whispering
her
with
a
smile
said
while
he
was
taking
his
station
at
the
harp
have
your
british
troubadours
usually
such
an
air
as
that
am
i
right
or
am
i
wrong
quite
right
replied
the
countess
in
as
low
a
voice
i
suppose
he
has
sung
of
kings
and
heroes
till
he
can
not
help
assuming
their
step
and
demeanor
but
how
did
he
come
by
those
eyes
answered
the
queen
if
singing
of
reuther
gaze
have
so
richly
endowed
his
own
by
getting
him
to
teach
me
his
art
i
may
warble
myself
into
a
complexion
as
fair
as
any
northern
beauty
but
then
his
must
not
be
the
subject
of
your
song
whispered
the
countess
with
a
laugh
for
methinks
it
is
rather
of
the
ethiop
hue
during
this
short
dialogue
which
was
heard
by
none
but
the
two
ladies
edward
was
speaking
with
gloucester
and
wallace
leaned
upon
his
harp
that
is
enough
said
the
king
to
his
now
let
me
hear
him
play
the
earl
gave
the
word
and
wallace
striking
the
chords
with
the
master
hand
of
genius
called
forth
such
strains
and
uttered
such
tones
from
his
full
and
voice
that
the
king
listened
with
wonder
and
the
queen
and
countess
scarcely
allowed
themselves
to
breathe
he
sung
the
parting
of
reuther
and
his
bride
and
their
souls
seemed
to
pant
upon
his
notes
he
changed
his
measure
and
their
bosoms
heaved
with
the
enthusiasm
which
spoke
from
his
lips
and
hand
for
he
urged
the
hero
to
battle
he
described
the
conflict
he
mourned
the
slain
he
sung
the
glorious
triumph
as
the
last
sweep
of
the
harp
rolled
its
lofty
diapason
on
the
ear
of
the
king
the
monarch
deigned
to
pronounce
him
unequaled
in
his
art
excess
of
delight
so
agitated
the
more
delicate
frames
of
the
ladies
that
while
they
poured
their
encomiums
on
the
minstrel
they
wiped
the
glistening
tears
form
their
cheeks
the
queen
approached
him
laid
her
hand
upon
the
harp
and
touching
the
strings
with
a
light
finger
said
with
a
sweet
smile
you
must
remain
with
the
king
musicians
and
teach
me
how
to
charm
as
you
do
wallace
replied
to
this
innocent
speech
with
a
smile
sweet
as
her
own
and
bowed
the
countess
drew
near
though
not
much
older
than
the
youthful
queen
she
had
been
married
twice
and
being
therefore
more
acquainted
with
the
proprieties
of
life
her
compliments
were
uttered
in
a
form
more
befitting
her
rank
and
the
supposed
quality
of
the
man
to
whom
the
queen
continued
to
pour
forth
her
less
considerate
praises
edward
desired
gloucester
to
bring
the
minstrel
closer
to
him
wallace
approached
the
royal
couch
edward
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
before
he
spoke
wallace
bore
his
eagle
gaze
with
an
undisturbed
countenance
he
neither
withdrew
his
eye
from
the
king
nor
did
he
allow
a
conqueror
fire
to
emit
from
its
glance
who
are
you
at
length
demanded
edward
who
surprised
at
the
noble
mien
and
unabashed
carriage
of
the
minstrel
conceived
some
suspicions
of
his
quality
wallace
saw
what
was
passing
in
the
king
mind
and
determining
by
a
frank
reply
to
uproot
his
doubts
mildly
but
fearlessly
answered
a
scot
indeed
said
the
king
satisfied
that
no
incendiary
would
dare
thus
to
proclaim
himself
and
how
durst
you
being
of
that
outlawed
nation
venture
into
my
court
feared
you
not
to
fall
a
sacrifice
to
my
indignation
against
the
mad
leader
of
your
rebellious
countrymen
i
fear
nothing
on
earth
replied
wallace
this
garb
is
privileged
none
who
respect
that
sacred
law
dare
commit
violence
on
a
minstrel
and
against
them
who
regard
no
law
but
that
of
their
own
wills
i
have
this
weapon
to
defend
me
as
wallace
spoke
he
pointed
to
a
dirk
stuck
in
his
girdle
you
are
a
bold
man
and
an
honest
man
i
believe
replied
the
king
and
as
my
queen
desires
it
i
order
your
enrollment
in
my
traveling
train
of
musicians
you
may
leave
the
presence
then
follow
me
to
my
apartment
cried
the
queen
countess
you
will
accompany
me
to
see
me
take
my
first
lesson
a
page
took
up
the
harp
and
wallace
bowing
his
head
to
the
king
was
conducted
by
gloucester
to
the
anteroom
of
the
queen
apartments
the
earl
there
told
him
that
when
dismissed
by
the
queen
a
page
he
would
leave
would
show
him
the
way
back
to
lord
carrick
the
royal
margaret
herself
opened
the
door
so
eager
was
she
to
admit
her
teacher
and
placing
herself
at
the
harp
she
attempted
a
passage
of
the
triumph
which
had
particularly
struck
her
but
she
played
wrong
wallace
was
asked
to
set
her
right
he
obeyed
she
was
quick
he
clear
in
his
explanations
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
made
her
execute
the
whole
movement
in
a
manner
that
delighted
her
why
minstrel
cried
she
looking
up
in
his
face
either
your
harp
is
enchanted
or
you
are
a
magician
i
have
studied
three
long
years
to
play
the
lute
and
could
never
bring
forth
any
tone
that
did
not
make
me
ready
to
stop
my
own
ears
and
now
countess
cried
she
again
touching
a
few
chords
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
enchanting
i
suppose
returned
the
countess
all
your
former
instructors
have
been
novices
and
this
scot
alone
knows
the
art
to
which
they
pretended
do
you
hear
what
the
countess
says
exclaimed
the
queen
affecting
to
whisper
to
him
she
will
not
allow
of
any
spiritual
agency
in
my
talent
if
you
can
contradict
her
do
for
i
want
very
much
to
believe
in
fairies
magicians
and
all
the
enchanting
world
wallace
with
a
respectful
smile
answered
i
know
of
now
spirit
that
has
interposed
in
your
majesty
favor
but
that
of
your
own
genius
and
it
is
more
efficient
than
the
agency
of
all
the
queen
looked
at
him
very
gravely
and
said
if
you
really
think
there
are
no
such
things
as
fairies
and
enchantments
for
so
your
words
would
imply
then
everybody
in
your
country
must
have
genius
for
they
seem
to
be
excellent
in
everything
your
warriors
are
so
peerlessly
brave
all
excepting
these
scottish
lords
who
are
such
favorites
with
the
king
i
wonder
what
he
can
see
in
their
uncouth
faces
or
find
in
their
rough
indelicate
conversation
to
admire
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
besetting
my
gracious
edward
i
am
sure
he
never
would
have
suspected
ill
of
the
noble
bruce
queen
margaret
cried
the
countess
of
gloucester
giving
her
a
look
of
respectful
reprehension
had
not
the
minstrel
better
retire
the
queen
blushed
and
recollected
that
she
was
giving
too
free
a
vent
to
her
sentiments
but
she
could
not
suffer
wallace
to
withdraw
i
have
yet
to
ask
you
resumed
she
the
warriors
of
scotland
being
so
resistless
and
their
minstrels
so
perfect
in
their
art
whether
all
the
ladies
can
be
so
beautiful
as
the
lady
helen
mar
the
eagerness
with
which
wallace
grasped
at
any
tidings
of
her
who
was
so
prime
an
object
of
his
enterprise
at
once
disturbed
the
composure
of
his
air
and
had
the
penetrating
eyes
of
the
countess
been
then
directed
toward
him
she
might
have
drawn
some
dangerous
conclusions
from
the
start
he
gave
at
the
mention
of
her
name
and
from
the
heightened
color
which
in
spite
of
his
exertions
to
suppress
all
evident
emotion
maintained
its
station
on
his
cheek
but
perhaps
you
have
never
seen
her
added
the
queen
wallace
replied
neither
denying
nor
affirming
her
question
i
have
heard
many
praise
her
beauty
but
more
her
virtues
well
i
am
sorry
continued
her
majesty
since
you
sing
so
sweetly
of
female
charms
that
you
have
not
seen
this
wonder
of
scottish
ladies
you
have
now
little
chance
of
that
good
fortune
for
earl
de
valence
has
taken
her
abroad
intending
to
marry
her
amidst
all
the
state
with
which
my
lord
has
invested
him
is
it
to
guienne
he
has
taken
her
inquired
wallace
yes
replied
the
queen
rather
pleased
than
offended
at
the
minstrel
ignorance
of
court
ceremony
in
thus
familiarly
presuming
to
put
a
question
to
her
she
continued
to
answer
while
so
near
scotland
he
could
not
win
her
to
forget
her
native
country
and
her
father
danger
who
it
seems
was
dying
when
de
valence
carried
her
away
and
to
prevent
bloodshed
between
the
earl
and
soulis
who
is
also
madly
in
love
with
her
my
edward
gave
the
english
lord
a
high
post
in
guienne
and
thither
they
are
gone
before
wallace
could
reply
to
some
remark
which
the
queen
laughingly
added
to
her
information
the
countess
thought
it
proper
to
give
her
gay
a
more
decisive
reminder
of
decorum
and
rising
she
whispered
something
which
covered
the
youthful
margaret
in
blushes
her
majesty
rose
directly
and
pushing
away
the
harp
hurryingly
said
you
may
leave
the
room
and
turning
her
back
to
wallace
walked
away
through
an
opposite
door
chapter
lix
the
round
tower
wallace
was
yet
recounting
the
particulars
of
his
royal
visit
to
bruce
who
had
anxiously
watched
his
return
when
one
of
the
attendants
appeared
and
presenting
him
with
a
silk
handkerchief
curiously
coiled
up
said
that
he
brought
it
from
her
majesty
who
supposed
it
must
be
his
as
she
found
it
in
the
room
where
he
had
been
playing
the
harp
wallace
was
going
to
say
that
it
did
not
belong
to
him
when
bruce
gave
him
a
look
which
directed
him
to
take
the
handkerchief
he
obeyed
without
a
word
and
the
boy
withdrew
bruce
smiled
there
is
more
in
that
handkerchief
than
silk
my
friend
queens
send
not
these
embassies
on
trifling
errands
while
bruce
spoke
wallace
unwrapped
it
i
told
you
so
cried
the
prince
with
a
frank
archness
playing
over
his
before
pensive
features
and
pointing
to
a
slip
of
emblazoned
vellum
which
became
unfolded
shall
i
look
aside
while
you
peruse
it
look
on
it
my
dear
prince
replied
wallace
for
in
trifles
as
well
as
in
things
of
moment
i
would
hold
no
reserves
with
you
the
vellum
was
then
opened
and
these
words
presented
themselves
presume
not
on
condescension
this
injunction
may
be
necessary
for
the
noble
lady
who
was
present
at
our
interview
tells
me
the
men
of
this
island
are
very
presuming
redeem
the
character
of
your
countrymen
and
transgress
not
on
a
courtesy
that
only
means
to
say
i
did
not
leave
you
this
morning
so
abruptly
out
of
unkindness
i
write
this
because
having
the
countess
ever
with
me
i
shall
not
even
dare
to
whisper
it
in
her
presence
be
always
faithful
and
respectful
minstrel
and
you
shall
ever
find
an
indulgent
mistress
a
page
will
call
you
when
your
attendance
is
desired
wallace
and
bruce
looked
on
each
other
bruce
first
spoke
had
you
vanity
my
friend
this
letter
from
so
lovely
and
innocent
a
creature
might
be
a
gratification
but
in
your
case
the
sentiment
it
breathes
is
full
of
danger
she
knows
not
the
secret
power
that
impelled
her
to
write
this
but
we
do
and
i
fear
it
will
point
an
attention
to
you
which
may
produce
effects
ruinous
to
our
projects
then
answered
wallace
our
alternative
is
to
escape
it
by
getting
away
this
very
night
and
as
you
persevere
in
your
resolution
not
to
enter
scotland
unaccompanied
by
me
and
will
share
my
attempt
to
rescue
lady
helen
mar
we
must
direct
our
course
immediately
to
the
continent
yes
instantly
and
securely
too
under
the
disguise
of
priests
returned
bruce
i
have
in
my
possession
the
wardrobe
of
the
confessor
who
followed
my
father
fortunes
and
who
on
his
death
retired
into
the
abbey
which
contains
his
remains
it
was
then
settled
between
the
friends
that
when
it
became
dark
they
should
dress
themselves
in
the
confessor
robes
and
by
means
of
the
queen
signet
which
she
had
given
to
wallace
at
the
banquet
pass
the
guard
as
priests
who
had
entered
by
some
other
gate
and
were
returned
from
shriving
her
majesty
once
without
the
city
they
could
make
a
swift
progress
southward
to
the
nearest
seaport
and
there
safely
embark
for
france
for
they
were
well
aware
that
the
moment
they
were
missed
suspicion
would
direct
pursuit
toward
the
scottish
border
in
these
arrangements
and
planning
their
future
movements
relative
to
the
rescue
of
lady
helen
they
passed
several
hours
and
were
only
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
lute
from
the
queen
for
her
minstrel
to
tune
wallace
obeyed
and
returning
it
by
the
page
who
brought
it
congratulated
himself
that
it
was
not
accompanied
by
any
new
summons
then
continuing
his
discourse
with
bruce
on
the
past
present
and
to
come
their
souls
grew
more
closely
entwined
as
they
more
intimately
recognized
their
kindred
natures
and
time
moved
on
unmarked
till
the
shadows
of
evening
deepened
into
night
now
is
our
hour
cried
bruce
starting
on
his
feet
go
you
into
that
room
and
array
yourself
in
the
confessor
robes
while
i
call
my
servants
to
dispense
with
their
usual
nightly
attendance
with
determination
and
hope
wallace
gladly
obeyed
in
that
very
same
instant
the
earl
of
gloucester
suddenly
entered
and
looking
round
the
room
with
a
disturbed
countenance
abruptly
said
where
is
the
minstrel
why
answered
bruce
with
an
alarm
which
he
vainly
tried
to
prevent
appearing
on
his
face
gloucester
advanced
close
to
him
is
any
one
within
hearing
no
one
then
replied
the
earl
his
life
is
in
danger
he
is
suspected
to
be
not
what
he
seems
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
to
stand
in
favor
with
the
queen
of
a
nature
to
incur
his
mortal
punishment
bruce
was
so
confounded
with
this
stoppage
of
all
their
plans
and
at
the
imminent
peril
of
wallace
that
he
could
not
speak
gloucester
proceeded
my
dear
bruce
from
the
circumstance
of
his
being
with
you
i
can
not
but
suppose
that
you
know
more
than
you
think
proper
to
disclose
whoever
he
may
be
whether
he
came
from
france
or
really
from
scotland
as
he
says
his
life
is
now
forfeited
and
that
by
attempting
to
screen
him
you
may
not
seem
to
share
his
imputed
guilt
i
come
to
warn
you
of
this
discovery
a
double
guard
is
set
around
the
keep
so
no
visible
means
are
left
for
his
escape
then
what
will
become
of
him
exclaimed
bruce
forgetting
all
caution
in
dismay
for
his
friend
am
i
to
see
the
bravest
of
men
the
savior
of
my
country
butchered
before
my
eyes
by
a
tyrant
i
may
die
gloucester
in
his
defense
but
i
will
never
surrender
him
to
his
enemy
gloucester
stood
aghast
at
this
disclosure
he
came
to
accuse
the
friend
of
bruce
that
bruce
might
be
prepared
to
clear
himself
of
connivance
with
so
treasonable
a
crime
but
now
that
he
found
this
friend
to
be
wallace
the
preserver
of
his
own
life
the
restorer
of
his
honor
at
berwick
he
immediately
resolved
to
give
him
freedom
bruce
cried
he
when
i
recollect
the
figure
and
deportment
of
this
minstrel
i
am
surprised
that
in
despite
of
his
disguise
i
did
not
recognize
the
invincible
regent
of
scotland
but
now
i
know
him
he
shall
find
that
generosity
is
not
confined
to
his
own
breast
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
not
stimulate
suspicion
by
remonstrating
with
edward
against
your
own
arrest
till
the
court
leaves
durham
and
i
will
instantly
find
a
way
to
conduct
your
friend
in
safety
from
the
castle
i
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
cried
bruce
release
but
him
and
if
you
demand
it
of
me
i
would
die
in
chains
he
saved
me
at
berwick
replied
gloucester
and
i
am
anxious
to
repay
the
debt
if
he
be
near
explain
what
has
happened
in
as
few
words
as
possible
for
we
must
not
delay
a
moment
i
left
a
council
with
the
enraged
king
settling
what
horrible
death
was
to
be
his
punishment
when
he
is
safe
answered
bruce
i
will
attest
his
innocence
to
you
meanwhile
rely
on
my
faith
that
you
are
giving
liberty
to
a
guiltless
man
bruce
hastened
to
wallace
who
had
just
completed
his
disguise
he
briefly
related
what
had
passed
and
received
for
answer
that
he
would
not
leave
his
prince
to
the
revenge
of
the
tyrant
but
bruce
urging
that
the
escape
of
the
one
could
alone
secure
that
of
the
other
implored
him
not
to
persist
in
refusing
his
offered
safety
but
to
make
direct
for
normandy
i
will
join
you
at
rouen
and
thence
we
can
proceed
to
guienne
added
he
the
hour
the
court
leaves
durham
is
that
of
my
escape
and
when
free
what
shall
divide
me
from
you
and
our
enterprise
wallace
had
hardly
assented
when
a
tumultuous
noise
broke
the
silence
of
the
courtyard
the
great
iron
doors
of
the
keep
were
thrown
back
on
their
hinges
and
the
clangor
of
arms
with
many
voices
resounded
in
the
hall
thinking
all
was
lost
with
a
cry
of
despair
bruce
drew
his
sword
and
threw
himself
before
his
friend
at
that
instant
gloucester
entered
the
room
they
are
quicker
than
i
thought
cried
he
but
follow
me
bruce
remain
where
you
are
sheathe
your
sword
be
bold
deny
you
know
anything
of
the
minstrel
and
all
will
be
well
as
he
spoke
the
feet
of
them
who
were
come
to
seize
wallace
already
sounded
in
the
adjoining
apartment
gloucester
grasped
the
scottish
hero
by
the
hand
turned
into
a
short
gallery
and
plucking
the
broad
shaft
of
a
cedar
pilaster
from
under
its
capital
let
himself
and
his
companion
into
a
passage
within
the
wall
of
the
building
the
ponderous
beam
closed
after
them
into
its
former
situation
and
the
silent
pair
descended
by
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
to
a
square
dungeon
without
any
visible
outlet
but
the
earl
found
one
by
raising
a
flat
stone
marked
by
an
elevated
cross
and
again
they
penetrated
lower
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
by
a
gradually
declining
path
till
they
stopped
on
a
subterranean
level
ground
this
vaulted
passage
said
gloucester
reaches
in
a
direct
line
to
fincklay
abbey
a
particular
circumstance
constrained
my
uncle
the
then
abbot
of
that
monastery
to
discover
it
to
me
ten
years
ago
he
told
me
that
to
none
but
the
bishops
of
durham
and
the
abbots
of
fincklay
was
the
secret
of
its
existence
revealed
since
my
coming
hither
this
time
which
was
to
escort
the
young
queen
not
to
bear
arms
against
scotland
i
one
day
took
it
into
my
head
to
revisit
this
recess
and
happily
for
the
gratitude
i
owe
to
you
i
found
all
as
i
had
left
it
in
my
lifetime
but
for
the
sake
of
my
honor
with
edward
whose
wrath
would
fall
upon
me
in
most
fearful
shapes
should
he
ever
know
that
i
delivered
his
vanquisher
out
of
his
hands
i
must
enjoin
you
to
secrecy
though
the
enemy
of
my
king
ambition
you
are
the
friend
of
mankind
you
were
my
benefactor
noble
wallace
and
i
should
deserve
the
rack
could
i
suffer
one
hair
of
your
head
to
fall
with
violence
to
the
ground
remains
of
this
curious
subterranean
passage
are
yet
to
be
seen
but
parts
of
them
are
now
broken
in
upon
by
water
and
therefore
the
communication
between
durham
and
fincklay
is
now
cut
off
with
answering
frankness
wallace
declared
his
sense
of
the
generosity
and
earnestly
commended
the
young
bruce
to
his
watchful
friendship
the
brave
impetuosity
of
his
mind
continued
he
at
times
may
overthrow
his
prudence
and
leave
him
exposed
to
dangers
which
a
little
virtuous
caution
might
avoid
dissimulation
is
a
baseness
i
should
shudder
at
seeing
him
practice
but
when
the
flood
of
indignation
swells
his
bosom
then
tell
him
that
i
conjure
him
on
the
life
of
his
dearest
wishes
to
be
silent
the
storm
which
threatens
must
blow
over
and
the
power
which
guides
through
perils
those
who
trust
in
it
will
ordain
that
we
shall
meet
again
gloucester
replied
what
you
say
i
will
repeat
to
bruce
i
am
too
sensible
that
my
royal
has
trampled
on
his
rights
and
should
i
ever
see
him
restored
to
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
hand
of
heaven
in
the
event
far
would
it
have
been
from
me
to
have
bound
him
to
remain
a
prisoner
during
sojourn
at
durham
had
i
not
been
certain
that
your
escape
and
his
together
would
now
give
birth
to
a
plausible
argument
in
the
minds
of
my
enemies
and
grounding
their
suspicions
on
my
acknowledged
attachment
to
bruce
the
king
might
have
been
persuaded
to
believe
me
unfaithful
to
his
interests
the
result
would
be
my
disgrace
and
a
broken
heart
to
her
who
has
raised
me
by
her
generous
love
from
the
humbler
ranks
of
nobility
to
that
of
a
prince
and
her
husband
gloucester
then
informed
wallace
that
about
two
hours
before
he
came
to
alarm
bruce
for
his
safety
on
this
occasion
he
was
summoned
by
edward
to
attend
him
immediately
when
he
obeyed
he
found
soulis
standing
by
the
royal
couch
and
his
majesty
talking
with
vehemence
at
sight
of
gloucester
he
beckoned
him
to
advance
and
striking
his
hand
fiercely
on
a
letter
he
held
he
exclaimed
here
my
son
behold
the
record
of
your
father
shame
of
a
king
of
england
dishonored
by
a
slave
as
he
spoke
he
dashed
it
from
him
soulis
answered
smiling
not
a
slave
my
lord
and
king
can
you
not
see
through
the
ill
adapted
disguise
the
figure
and
mien
of
nobility
he
is
some
foreign
lover
of
your
bride
come
enough
interrupted
the
king
i
know
i
am
dishonored
but
the
villain
shall
die
read
the
letter
gloucester
and
say
what
tortures
shall
stamp
my
vengeance
gloucester
opened
the
vellum
and
read
in
the
queen
hand
gentle
minstrel
my
lady
countess
tells
me
i
must
not
see
you
again
were
you
old
or
ugly
as
most
bards
are
i
might
she
says
but
being
young
it
is
not
for
a
queen
to
smile
upon
one
of
your
calling
she
bade
me
remember
that
when
i
smiled
you
smiled
too
and
that
you
asked
me
questions
unbecoming
your
degree
pray
do
not
do
this
any
more
though
i
see
no
harm
in
it
alas
i
used
to
smile
as
i
liked
when
i
was
in
france
oh
if
it
were
not
for
those
i
love
best
who
are
now
in
england
i
wish
i
were
there
again
and
you
would
go
with
me
gentle
minstrel
would
you
not
and
you
would
teach
me
to
sing
so
sweetly
i
would
then
never
talk
with
you
but
would
always
speak
in
song
how
pretty
that
would
be
and
then
we
should
be
from
under
the
eyes
of
this
harsh
countess
my
ladies
in
france
would
let
you
come
in
and
stay
as
long
with
me
as
i
pleased
but
as
i
can
not
go
back
again
i
will
make
myself
happy
here
in
spite
of
the
countess
who
rules
me
more
as
if
she
were
my
stepmother
than
i
hers
but
then
to
be
sure
she
is
a
few
years
older
i
will
see
you
this
evening
and
your
sweet
harp
shall
sing
all
my
to
sleep
my
french
lady
of
honor
will
conduct
you
secretly
to
my
apartments
i
am
sure
you
are
too
honest
even
to
guess
at
what
the
countess
thinks
you
might
fancy
when
i
smile
on
you
but
gentle
minstrel
presume
not
and
you
shall
ever
find
an
indulgent
mistress
in
m
at
the
last
vespers
my
page
shall
come
for
you
gloucester
knew
the
queen
handwriting
and
not
being
able
to
contradict
that
this
letter
was
hers
he
inquired
how
it
came
into
his
majesty
hands
i
found
it
replied
soulis
in
crossing
the
courtyard
it
lay
on
the
ground
where
doubtless
it
had
been
accidentally
dropped
by
the
queen
messenger
gloucester
wishing
to
extenuate
for
the
queen
sake
whose
youth
and
inexperience
he
pitied
affirmed
that
from
the
simplicity
with
which
the
note
was
written
from
her
innocent
references
to
the
profession
he
could
not
suppose
that
she
addressed
him
in
any
other
character
if
he
be
only
a
base
itinerant
harper
replied
the
king
the
deeper
is
my
disgrace
for
if
a
passion
of
another
king
than
music
be
not
portrayed
in
every
word
of
this
artful
letter
i
never
read
a
heart
the
king
continued
to
comment
on
the
fatal
scroll
with
the
of
jealousy
loading
her
name
with
every
opprobrium
gloucester
inwardly
thanked
heaven
that
none
other
than
soulis
and
himself
were
present
to
hear
edward
fasten
such
foul
dishonor
on
his
queen
the
generous
earl
could
not
find
other
arguments
to
assuage
the
mountain
ire
of
her
husband
she
might
be
innocent
of
actual
guilt
or
indeed
of
being
aware
of
more
than
a
queen
usual
interest
in
a
poor
wandering
minstrel
was
as
the
king
said
in
every
line
gloucester
remaining
silent
edward
believed
him
convinced
of
the
queen
crime
and
being
too
wrathful
to
think
of
caution
he
sent
for
the
bishop
and
others
of
his
lords
and
when
they
entered
vented
to
them
also
his
injury
and
indignation
many
were
not
inclined
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
with
their
sovereign
some
thought
with
gloucester
others
deemed
the
letter
altogether
a
forgery
and
a
few
adopted
the
severer
inferences
of
her
husband
but
all
united
even
those
determined
to
spare
the
queen
in
recommending
an
immediate
apprehension
and
private
execution
of
the
minstrel
it
is
not
fit
cried
soulis
that
a
man
who
has
ever
been
suspected
of
invading
our
monarch
honor
should
live
another
hour
this
sanguinary
sentence
was
acceded
to
and
with
as
little
remorse
by
the
whole
assembly
as
if
they
had
merely
condemned
a
tree
to
the
ax
such
is
the
carelessness
with
which
the
generality
of
arbitrary
assemblies
decide
on
the
fate
of
a
fellow
mortal
earl
percy
who
gave
his
vote
for
the
death
of
the
minstrel
more
from
this
culpable
inconsideration
than
that
thirst
of
blood
which
stimulated
the
voices
of
soulis
and
the
cummins
proposed
as
he
believed
the
queen
innocent
that
honor
should
be
examined
relative
to
the
circumstances
mentioned
in
the
letter
the
king
immediately
ordered
their
attendance
the
royal
jane
of
acre
appeared
at
the
first
summons
and
spoke
with
an
air
of
truth
and
freedom
from
alarm
which
convinced
every
candid
ear
of
the
innocence
of
the
queen
her
testimony
was
that
she
believed
the
minstrel
to
be
other
than
he
seemed
but
she
was
certain
from
the
conversations
which
the
queen
had
held
with
her
after
the
feast
that
it
was
at
this
very
feast
she
had
first
seen
him
and
that
she
was
ignorant
of
his
real
rank
on
being
questioned
by
the
bishop
the
countess
acknowledged
that
her
majesty
had
praised
his
figure
as
well
as
his
singing
yet
not
more
added
she
than
she
afterward
did
to
the
king
when
she
awakened
his
curiosity
to
send
for
him
her
highness
continued
to
reply
to
the
interrogatories
put
to
her
by
saying
that
it
was
in
the
king
presence
she
herself
first
saw
the
minstrel
and
then
she
thought
his
demeanor
much
above
his
situation
but
when
he
accompanied
the
queen
and
herself
into
her
apartments
she
had
then
an
opportunity
to
observe
him
narrowly
as
the
queen
engaged
him
in
conversation
and
by
his
answers
questions
and
easy
yet
respectful
deportment
she
became
convinced
he
was
not
what
he
appeared
and
why
jane
asked
the
king
did
you
not
impart
these
suspicions
to
your
husband
or
to
me
because
replied
she
remembering
that
my
interference
on
a
certain
public
occasion
brought
my
late
husband
clare
under
your
displeasure
on
my
marriage
with
monthermer
i
made
a
solemn
vow
before
my
confessor
never
to
offend
in
the
like
manner
and
besides
the
countenance
of
this
stranger
was
so
ingenious
and
his
sentiments
so
natural
and
honorable
i
could
not
suspect
he
came
on
any
disloyal
errand
lady
observed
one
of
the
elder
lords
if
you
thought
so
well
of
the
queen
and
of
this
man
why
did
you
caution
her
against
his
smiles
and
deem
it
necessary
to
persuade
her
not
to
see
him
again
the
countess
blushed
at
this
question
but
replied
because
i
saw
the
minstrel
was
a
gentleman
he
possessed
a
noble
figure
and
a
handsome
face
in
spite
of
his
egyptian
skin
like
most
young
gentlemen
he
might
be
conscious
of
these
advantages
and
attribute
the
artless
approbation
the
innocent
smiles
of
my
gracious
queen
to
a
source
more
flattering
to
his
vanity
i
have
known
many
lords
not
far
from
your
majesty
make
similar
mistakes
on
as
little
grounds
added
she
looking
disdainfully
toward
some
of
the
younger
nobles
and
therefore
to
prevent
such
insolence
i
desired
his
final
dismission
thank
you
my
dear
jane
replied
the
king
you
almost
persuade
me
of
margaret
innocence
believe
it
sire
cried
she
with
animation
whatever
romantic
thoughtlessness
her
youth
and
inexperience
may
have
led
her
into
i
pledge
my
life
on
her
purity
first
let
us
hear
what
that
french
woman
has
to
say
to
the
assignation
exclaimed
soulis
whose
polluted
heart
could
not
suppose
the
existence
of
true
purity
and
whose
cruel
disposition
exulted
in
torturing
and
death
question
her
and
then
her
majesty
may
have
full
acquittal
again
the
brow
of
edward
was
overcast
the
fiends
of
jealously
once
more
tugged
at
his
heart
and
ordering
the
countess
of
gloucester
to
withdraw
he
commanded
the
baroness
de
pontoise
to
be
brought
into
his
presence
when
she
saw
the
king
threatening
looks
and
beheld
the
fearful
expression
which
shot
from
every
surrounding
countenance
she
shrunk
with
terror
long
backneyed
in
secret
gallantries
the
same
inward
whisper
which
had
proclaimed
to
soulis
that
the
queen
was
guilty
induced
her
to
believe
that
she
had
been
the
confidante
of
an
illicit
passion
and
therefore
though
she
knew
nothing
really
bad
of
her
unhappy
mistress
yet
fancying
that
she
did
she
stood
before
the
royal
tribunal
with
the
air
and
aspect
of
a
culprit
repeat
to
me
demanded
the
king
or
answer
it
with
your
head
all
that
you
know
of
queen
margaret
intimacy
with
the
man
who
calls
himself
a
minstrel
at
these
words
which
were
delivered
in
a
tone
that
seemed
the
sentence
of
death
the
french
woman
fell
on
her
knees
and
in
a
burst
of
terror
exclaimed
sire
i
will
reveal
all
if
your
majesty
will
grant
me
pardon
for
having
too
faithfully
served
my
mistress
speak
speak
cried
the
king
with
desperate
impatience
i
swear
to
pardon
you
even
if
you
have
joined
in
a
conspiracy
against
my
life
but
speak
the
truth
and
all
the
truth
that
judgment
without
mercy
may
fall
on
the
guilty
heads
then
i
obey
answered
the
baroness
foul
betrayer
gloucester
turning
disappointed
away
o
what
it
is
to
be
vile
and
to
trust
the
vile
but
virtue
will
not
be
auxiliary
to
vice
and
so
wickedness
falls
by
its
own
agents
the
baroness
raised
from
her
kneeling
position
by
soulis
began
the
only
time
i
ever
heard
of
or
saw
this
man
to
my
knowledge
was
when
he
was
brought
to
play
before
my
lady
at
the
bishop
banquet
i
did
not
much
observe
him
being
engaged
in
conversation
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
so
i
can
not
say
whether
i
might
not
have
seen
him
in
france
for
many
noble
lords
adored
the
princess
margaret
though
she
appeared
to
frown
upon
them
all
but
i
must
confess
when
i
attended
her
majesty
disrobing
after
the
feast
she
put
to
me
so
many
questions
about
what
i
thought
of
the
minstrel
who
had
sung
so
divinely
that
i
began
to
think
her
admiration
too
great
to
have
been
awakened
by
a
mere
song
and
then
she
asked
me
if
a
king
could
have
a
nobler
air
than
he
had
and
she
laughed
and
said
she
would
send
your
majesty
to
school
to
learn
of
him
damnable
traitress
exclaimed
the
king
the
baroness
paused
and
retreated
before
the
sudden
fury
which
flashed
from
his
eyes
go
on
cried
he
hide
neither
word
nor
circumstance
that
my
vengeance
may
lose
nothing
of
its
aim
she
proceeded
her
majesty
then
talked
of
his
beautiful
eyes
so
blue
she
said
so
tender
yet
proud
in
their
looks
and
only
a
minstrel
pontoise
added
she
you
explain
that
i
being
rather
perhaps
too
well
learned
in
the
idle
tales
of
our
troubadours
heedlessly
answered
he
is
some
king
in
disguise
just
come
to
look
at
your
majesty
charms
and
go
away
again
she
laughed
much
at
this
conceit
said
he
must
be
one
of
pharaoh
race
then
and
that
had
he
not
such
white
teeth
his
complexion
would
be
intolerable
being
pleased
to
see
her
majesty
in
such
spirits
and
thinking
no
ill
i
sportively
answered
read
once
of
a
certain
spanish
lover
who
went
to
the
court
of
tunis
to
carry
off
the
king
daughter
and
he
had
so
black
a
face
that
none
suspected
him
to
be
other
than
the
moorish
prince
of
granada
when
lo
one
day
in
a
on
the
sea
he
fell
overboard
and
came
up
with
the
fairest
face
in
the
world
and
presently
acknowledged
himself
to
be
the
christian
king
of
castile
the
queen
laughed
at
this
story
but
not
answering
me
went
to
bed
next
morning
when
i
entered
her
chamber
she
received
me
with
even
more
gayety
and
putting
aside
my
coiffure
said
me
see
if
i
can
find
the
devil
mark
here
do
you
mean
i
asked
your
majesty
take
me
for
a
witch
so
she
replied
a
little
sprite
told
me
last
night
that
all
you
told
me
was
true
and
then
she
began
to
tell
me
with
many
smiles
that
she
had
dreamed
the
minstrel
was
the
very
prince
of
portugal
whom
unseen
she
had
refused
for
the
king
of
england
and
that
he
gave
her
a
harp
set
with
jewels
she
then
went
to
your
majesty
and
i
saw
no
more
of
her
till
she
sent
for
me
late
in
the
evening
she
seemed
very
angry
are
faithful
said
she
to
me
you
know
me
de
pontoise
you
know
me
too
proud
to
degrade
myself
and
too
highminded
to
submit
to
tyranny
the
countess
of
gloucester
with
persuasions
too
like
commands
will
not
allow
me
to
see
the
minstrel
any
more
she
then
declared
her
determination
that
she
would
see
him
that
she
would
feign
herself
sick
and
he
should
come
and
sing
to
her
when
she
was
alone
and
that
she
was
sure
he
was
too
modest
to
presume
on
her
condescension
i
said
something
to
dissuade
her
but
she
overruled
me
and
shame
to
myself
i
consented
to
assist
her
she
embraced
me
and
gave
me
a
letter
to
convey
to
him
which
i
did
by
slipping
it
beneath
the
ornaments
of
the
handle
of
her
lute
which
i
sent
as
an
excuse
for
the
minstrel
to
tune
it
was
to
acquaint
him
with
her
intentions
and
this
night
he
was
to
have
visited
her
apartment
during
this
recital
the
king
sat
with
compressed
lips
listening
but
with
a
countenance
proclaiming
the
collecting
tempest
within
changing
to
livid
paleness
or
portentous
fire
at
almost
every
sentence
on
mentioning
the
letter
he
clinched
his
hand
as
if
then
he
grasped
the
thunderbolt
the
lords
immediately
apprehended
that
this
was
the
letter
which
soulis
found
and
is
this
all
you
know
of
the
affair
inquired
percy
seeing
that
she
made
a
pause
and
enough
too
cried
soulis
to
blast
the
most
vaunted
chastity
in
christendom
take
the
woman
hence
cried
the
king
in
a
burst
of
wrath
that
gave
his
voice
a
preternatural
force
which
yet
resounded
from
the
vaulted
roof
while
he
added
never
let
me
see
her
traitor
face
again
the
baroness
withdrew
in
terror
and
edward
calling
sir
piers
gaveston
commanded
him
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
a
double
guard
and
go
in
person
to
bring
the
object
of
his
officious
introduction
to
meet
the
punishment
due
to
his
crime
for
cried
the
king
be
he
prince
or
peasant
i
will
see
him
hanged
before
my
eyes
and
then
return
his
wanton
paramour
branded
with
infamy
to
her
disgraced
family
soulis
now
suggested
that
as
the
delinquent
was
to
be
found
with
bruce
most
likely
that
young
nobleman
was
privy
to
his
designs
we
shall
see
to
him
hereafter
replied
the
king
meanwhile
look
that
i
am
obeyed
the
moment
this
order
passed
the
king
lips
gloucester
now
not
doubting
the
queen
guilt
hastened
to
warn
bruce
of
what
had
occurred
that
he
might
separate
himself
from
the
crime
of
a
man
who
appeared
to
have
been
under
his
protection
but
when
he
found
that
the
accused
was
no
other
than
the
universally
feared
universally
beloved
and
generous
wallace
all
other
considerations
were
lost
in
the
desire
of
delivering
him
from
the
impending
danger
he
knew
the
means
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
employ
them
during
the
recital
of
this
narrative
gloucester
narrowly
observed
the
auditor
and
the
ingenuous
bursts
of
his
indignation
and
the
horror
he
evinced
at
the
crime
he
was
suspected
of
having
committed
the
earl
while
more
fully
convinced
of
his
innocence
easily
conceived
how
the
queen
sentiments
for
him
might
have
gone
no
further
than
a
childish
admiration
very
pardonable
in
a
guileless
creature
hardly
more
than
sixteen
see
cried
wallace
the
power
which
lies
with
the
describer
of
actions
the
chaste
mind
of
your
countess
saw
nothing
in
the
conduct
of
the
queen
but
thoughtless
simplicity
the
contaminated
heart
of
the
baroness
de
pontoise
descried
passion
in
every
word
wantonness
in
every
movement
and
judging
of
her
mistress
by
herself
she
has
wrought
this
mighty
ruin
how
then
does
it
behove
virtue
to
admit
the
virtuous
only
to
her
intimacy
association
with
the
vicious
makes
her
to
be
seen
in
their
colors
impress
your
king
with
this
conclusion
and
were
it
not
for
endangering
the
safety
of
bruce
the
hope
of
my
country
i
myself
would
return
and
stake
my
life
on
proving
the
innocence
of
the
queen
of
england
but
if
a
letter
with
my
word
of
honor
could
convince
the
king
i
accept
the
offer
interrupted
gloucester
i
am
too
warmly
the
friend
of
bruce
too
truly
grateful
to
you
to
betray
either
into
danger
but
from
sunderland
whither
i
recommend
you
to
go
and
there
embark
for
france
write
the
declaration
you
mention
and
inclose
it
to
me
i
can
contrive
that
the
king
shall
have
your
letter
without
suspecting
by
what
channel
and
then
i
trust
all
will
be
well
during
this
discourse
they
passed
on
through
the
vaulted
passage
till
arriving
at
a
wooden
crucifix
which
marked
the
boundary
of
the
domain
of
durham
gloucester
stopped
i
must
not
go
further
should
i
prolong
my
stay
from
the
castle
during
the
search
for
you
suspicion
may
be
awakened
you
must
therefore
proceed
alone
go
straight
forward
and
at
the
extremity
of
the
vault
you
will
find
a
flag
stone
surmounted
like
the
one
by
which
we
descended
raise
it
and
it
will
let
you
into
the
cemetery
of
the
abbey
of
fincklay
one
end
of
that
is
always
open
to
the
east
thence
you
will
emerge
to
the
open
world
and
may
it
in
future
noble
wallace
ever
treat
you
according
to
your
unequaled
merits
farewell
the
earl
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
and
wallace
pursued
his
way
through
the
rayless
darkness
toward
the
fincklay
extremity
of
the
vault
chapter
lx
gallic
seas
wallace
having
issued
from
his
subterranean
journey
made
direct
to
sunderland
where
he
arrived
about
sunrise
a
vessel
belonging
to
france
which
since
the
marriage
of
margaret
with
edward
had
been
in
amity
with
england
as
well
as
scotland
rode
there
waiting
a
favorable
wind
wallace
secured
a
passage
in
her
and
going
on
board
wrote
his
promised
letter
to
edward
it
ran
thus
this
testament
is
to
assure
edward
king
of
england
upon
the
word
of
a
knight
that
queen
margaret
his
wife
is
in
every
respect
guiltless
of
the
crimes
alleged
against
her
by
the
lord
soulis
and
sworn
to
by
the
baroness
de
pontoise
i
came
to
the
court
of
durham
on
an
errand
connected
with
my
country
and
that
i
might
be
unknown
i
assumed
the
disguise
of
a
minstrel
by
accident
i
encountered
sir
piers
gaveston
and
ignorant
that
i
was
other
than
i
seemed
he
introduced
me
at
the
royal
banquet
it
was
there
i
first
saw
her
majesty
and
i
never
had
that
honor
but
three
times
and
the
third
and
last
in
her
apartments
to
which
your
majesty
self
saw
me
withdraw
the
countess
of
gloucester
was
present
the
whole
time
and
to
her
highness
i
appeal
the
queen
saw
in
me
only
a
minstrel
on
my
art
alone
as
a
musician
was
her
favor
bestowed
and
by
expressing
it
with
an
ingenuous
warmth
which
none
other
than
an
innocent
heart
would
have
dared
to
display
she
has
thus
exposed
herself
to
the
animadversions
of
libertinism
and
to
the
false
representations
of
a
because
worthless
friend
i
have
escaped
the
snare
which
the
queen
enemies
laid
for
me
and
for
her
sake
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
your
own
peace
king
edward
i
declare
before
the
searcher
of
all
hearts
and
before
the
world
in
whose
esteem
i
hope
to
live
and
die
that
your
wife
is
innocent
and
should
i
ever
meet
the
man
who
after
this
declaration
dares
to
unite
her
name
with
mine
in
a
tale
of
infamy
by
the
power
of
truth
i
swear
that
i
will
make
him
write
a
recantation
with
his
blood
pure
as
a
virgin
chastity
is
and
shall
ever
be
the
honor
of
william
wallace
this
letter
was
inclosed
in
one
to
the
earl
of
gloucester
and
having
dispatched
his
packet
to
durham
the
scottish
chief
gladly
saw
a
brisk
wind
blow
up
from
the
the
ship
weighed
anchor
cleared
the
harbor
and
under
a
fair
sky
swiftly
cut
the
waves
toward
the
gallic
shores
but
ere
she
reached
them
the
warlike
star
of
wallace
directed
to
his
little
bark
the
terrific
sails
of
the
red
reaver
a
formidable
pirate
who
then
infested
the
gallic
seas
swept
their
commerce
and
insulted
their
navy
he
attacked
the
french
vessel
but
it
carried
a
greater
than
caesar
and
his
fortunes
wallace
and
his
destiny
were
there
and
the
enemy
struck
to
the
scottish
chief
the
red
reaver
so
surnamed
because
of
his
red
sails
and
sanguinary
deeds
was
killed
in
the
action
but
his
younger
brother
thomas
de
longueville
was
found
alive
with
in
the
captive
ship
and
a
yet
greater
prize
prince
louis
of
france
who
having
been
out
the
day
before
on
a
had
been
descried
and
seized
as
an
invaluable
booty
by
the
red
reaver
adverse
winds
for
some
time
prevented
wallace
from
reaching
port
with
his
capture
but
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
victory
he
cast
anchor
in
the
harbor
of
havre
the
indisposition
of
the
prince
from
a
wound
he
had
received
in
his
own
conflict
with
the
reaver
made
it
necessary
to
apprise
king
philip
of
the
accident
in
answer
to
wallace
dispatches
on
this
subject
the
grateful
monarch
added
to
the
proffers
of
personal
friendship
which
had
been
the
substance
of
his
majesty
embassy
to
scotland
a
pressing
invitation
that
the
scottish
chief
would
accompany
the
prince
to
paris
and
there
receive
a
public
mark
of
royal
gratitude
which
with
due
honor
should
record
this
service
done
to
france
to
future
ages
meanwhile
philip
sent
the
chief
a
suit
of
armor
with
a
request
that
he
would
wear
it
in
remembrance
of
france
and
his
own
heroism
but
nothing
could
tempt
wallace
to
turn
aside
from
his
duty
impatient
to
pursue
his
journey
toward
the
spot
where
he
hoped
to
meet
bruce
he
wrote
a
respectful
excuse
to
the
king
but
arraying
himself
in
the
monarch
martial
present
to
assure
his
majesty
by
the
evidence
of
his
son
that
his
royal
wish
had
been
so
far
obeyed
he
went
to
the
prince
to
bid
him
farewell
louis
was
preparing
for
their
departure
all
three
together
with
young
de
longueville
whose
pardon
wallace
had
obtained
from
the
king
on
account
of
the
youth
abhorrence
of
the
service
which
his
brother
had
compelled
him
to
adopt
and
the
two
young
men
from
different
feelings
expressed
their
disappointment
when
they
found
that
their
benefactor
was
going
to
leave
them
wallace
gave
his
highness
a
packet
for
the
king
containing
a
brief
statement
of
his
vow
to
lord
mar
and
a
promise
that
when
he
had
fulfilled
it
philip
should
see
him
at
paris
the
royal
cavalcade
then
separated
from
the
deliverer
of
its
prince
and
wallace
mounting
a
arabian
which
had
accompanied
his
splendid
armor
took
the
road
to
rouen
meanwhile
events
not
less
momentous
took
place
at
durham
the
instant
wallace
had
followed
the
earl
of
gloucester
from
the
apartment
in
the
castle
it
was
entered
by
sir
piers
gaveston
he
demanded
the
minstrel
bruce
replied
he
knew
not
where
he
was
gaveston
eager
to
convince
the
king
that
he
was
no
accomplice
with
the
suspected
person
put
the
question
a
second
time
and
in
a
tone
which
he
meant
should
intimidate
the
scottish
prince
where
is
the
minstrel
i
know
not
replied
bruce
and
will
you
dare
to
tell
me
earl
asked
his
interrogator
that
within
this
quarter
of
an
hour
he
has
not
been
in
this
tower
nay
in
this
very
room
the
guards
in
your
antechamber
have
told
me
that
he
was
and
can
lord
carrick
stoop
to
utter
a
falsehood
to
screen
an
wandering
beggar
while
he
was
speaking
bruce
stood
eying
him
with
increasing
scorn
gaveston
paused
you
expect
me
to
answer
you
said
the
prince
out
of
respect
to
myself
i
will
for
such
is
the
unsullied
honor
of
robert
bruce
that
even
the
air
shall
not
be
tainted
with
slander
against
his
truth
without
being
repurified
by
its
confutation
gaveston
you
have
known
me
five
years
two
of
them
we
passed
together
in
the
jousts
of
flanders
and
yet
you
believe
me
capable
of
falsehood
know
then
unworthy
of
the
esteem
i
have
bestowed
on
you
that
neither
to
save
mean
or
great
would
i
deviate
from
the
strict
line
of
truth
the
man
you
seek
may
have
been
in
this
tower
in
this
room
as
you
present
are
and
as
little
am
i
bound
to
know
where
he
now
is
as
whither
you
go
when
you
relieve
me
from
an
inquisition
which
i
hold
myself
accountable
to
no
man
to
answer
is
well
cried
gaveston
and
i
am
to
carry
this
haughty
message
to
the
king
if
you
deliver
it
as
a
message
answered
bruce
you
will
prove
that
they
who
are
ready
to
suspect
falsehood
find
its
utterance
easy
my
reply
is
to
you
when
king
edward
speaks
to
me
i
shall
find
the
answer
that
is
due
to
him
these
attempts
to
provoke
me
into
a
private
quarrel
cried
gaveston
will
not
succeed
i
am
not
to
be
so
foiled
in
my
duty
i
must
seek
the
man
through
your
apartments
by
whose
authority
demanded
bruce
by
my
own
as
the
loyal
subject
of
my
outraged
monarch
he
bade
me
bring
the
traitor
before
him
and
thus
i
obey
while
speaking
gaveston
beckoned
to
his
attendants
to
follow
him
to
the
door
whence
wallace
had
disappeared
bruce
threw
himself
before
it
i
must
forget
the
duty
i
owe
to
myself
before
i
allow
you
or
any
other
man
to
invade
my
privacy
i
have
already
given
you
the
answer
that
becomes
robert
bruce
and
in
respect
to
your
knighthood
instead
of
compelling
i
request
you
to
withdraw
gaveston
hesitated
but
he
knew
the
determined
character
of
his
opponent
and
therefore
with
no
very
good
grace
muttering
that
he
should
hear
of
it
from
a
more
powerful
quarter
he
left
the
room
and
certainly
his
threats
were
not
in
this
instance
vain
for
prompt
was
the
arrival
of
a
marshal
and
his
officers
to
force
bruce
before
the
king
robert
bruce
earl
of
cleveland
carrick
and
annandale
i
come
to
summon
you
into
the
presence
of
your
liege
lord
edward
of
england
the
earl
of
cleveland
obeys
replied
bruce
and
with
a
fearless
step
he
walked
out
before
the
marshal
when
he
entered
the
sir
piers
gaveston
stood
beside
the
royal
couch
as
if
prepared
to
be
his
accuser
the
king
sat
supported
by
pillows
paler
with
the
mortifications
of
jealousy
and
baffled
authority
than
from
the
effects
of
his
wounds
robert
bruce
cried
he
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
on
him
but
the
sight
of
his
mourning
habit
made
a
stroke
upon
his
heart
that
sent
out
evidence
of
remorse
in
large
globules
on
his
forehead
he
paused
wiped
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
resumed
are
you
not
afraid
presumptuous
young
man
thus
to
provoke
your
sovereign
are
you
not
afraid
that
i
shall
make
that
audacious
head
answer
for
the
man
whom
you
thus
dare
to
screen
from
my
just
revenge
bruce
felt
all
the
injuries
he
had
suffered
from
this
proud
king
rush
at
once
upon
his
memory
and
without
changing
his
position
or
lowering
the
lofty
expression
of
his
looks
he
firmly
answered
the
judgment
of
a
just
king
i
can
not
fear
the
sentence
of
an
unjust
one
i
despise
this
to
his
majesty
face
exclaimed
soulis
insolence
rebellion
chastisement
even
death
were
the
words
which
murmured
round
the
room
at
the
honest
reply
edward
had
too
much
good
sense
to
echo
any
one
of
them
but
turning
to
bruce
with
a
sensation
of
shame
he
would
gladly
have
repressed
he
said
that
in
consideration
of
his
youth
he
would
pardon
him
what
had
passed
and
reinstate
him
in
all
the
late
earl
of
carrick
honors
if
he
would
immediately
declare
where
he
had
hidden
the
offending
minstrel
i
have
not
hidden
him
cried
bruce
nor
do
i
know
where
he
is
but
had
that
been
confided
to
me
as
i
know
him
to
be
an
innocent
man
no
power
on
earth
should
have
wrenched
him
from
me
boy
exclaimed
earl
buchan
with
a
laugh
of
contempt
do
you
flatter
yourself
that
he
would
trust
such
a
novice
as
you
are
with
secrets
of
this
nature
bruce
turned
on
him
an
eye
of
fire
buchan
replied
he
i
will
answer
you
on
other
ground
meanwhile
remember
that
the
secrets
of
good
men
are
open
to
every
virtuous
heart
those
of
the
wicked
they
would
be
glad
to
conceal
from
themselves
robert
bruce
cried
the
king
before
i
came
this
northern
journey
i
ever
found
you
one
of
the
most
devoted
of
my
servants
the
gentlest
youth
in
my
court
and
how
do
i
see
you
at
this
moment
braving
my
nobles
to
my
face
how
is
it
that
until
now
this
spirit
never
broke
forth
because
answered
the
prince
until
now
i
have
never
seen
the
virtuous
friend
whom
you
call
upon
me
to
betray
then
you
confess
cried
the
king
that
he
was
an
instigator
to
rebellion
i
avow
answered
bruce
that
i
never
knew
what
true
loyalty
was
till
he
taught
it
me
i
never
knew
the
nature
of
real
chastity
till
he
explained
it
to
me
nor
comprehended
what
virtue
might
be
till
he
allowed
me
to
see
in
himself
incorruptible
fidelity
bravery
undaunted
and
a
purity
of
heart
not
to
be
contaminated
and
this
is
the
man
on
whom
these
lords
would
fasten
a
charge
of
treason
and
adultery
but
out
of
the
filthy
depths
of
their
own
breast
arise
the
streams
from
which
they
would
blacked
his
fairness
your
vindication
cried
the
king
confirms
his
guilt
you
admit
that
he
is
not
a
minstrel
in
reality
wherefore
then
did
he
steal
in
ambuscade
into
my
palace
but
to
betray
either
my
honor
or
my
life
perhaps
both
his
errand
here
was
to
see
me
rash
boy
cried
edward
then
you
acknowledge
yourself
a
premeditated
conspirator
against
me
soulis
now
whispered
in
the
king
ear
but
so
low
that
bruce
did
not
hear
him
penetrate
further
my
liege
this
may
be
only
a
false
confession
to
shield
the
queen
character
she
who
has
once
betrayed
her
duty
finds
it
easy
to
reward
such
handsome
advocates
the
scarlet
of
inextinguishable
wrath
now
burned
on
the
face
of
edward
i
will
confront
them
returned
he
surprise
them
into
betraying
each
other
by
his
immediate
orders
the
queen
was
brought
in
she
leaned
on
the
countess
of
gloucester
jane
cried
the
king
leave
that
woman
let
her
impudence
sustain
her
rather
her
innocence
my
lord
said
the
countess
bowing
and
hesitating
to
go
leave
her
to
that
returned
the
incensed
husband
and
she
would
grovel
on
the
earth
like
her
own
base
passions
but
stand
before
me
she
shall
and
without
other
support
than
the
devils
within
her
for
pity
cried
the
queen
extending
her
clasped
hands
toward
edward
and
bursting
into
tears
have
mercy
on
me
for
i
am
innocent
prove
it
then
cried
the
king
by
agreeing
with
this
confidant
of
your
minstrel
and
at
once
tell
me
by
what
name
you
addressed
him
when
you
allured
him
to
my
court
is
he
french
spanish
or
english
by
the
virgin
holy
purity
i
swear
cried
the
queen
sinking
on
her
knees
that
i
never
allured
him
to
this
court
i
never
beheld
him
till
i
saw
him
at
the
bishop
banquet
and
for
his
name
i
know
it
not
oh
vilest
of
the
vile
cried
the
king
fiercely
grasping
his
couch
and
didst
thou
become
a
wanton
at
a
glance
from
my
sight
this
moment
or
i
shall
blast
thee
the
queen
dropped
senseless
into
the
arms
of
the
earl
of
gloucester
who
at
that
moment
entered
from
seeing
wallace
through
the
cavern
at
sight
of
him
bruce
knew
that
his
friend
was
safe
and
fearless
for
himself
when
the
cause
of
outraged
innocence
was
at
stake
he
suddenly
exclaimed
by
one
word
king
edward
i
will
confirm
the
blamelessness
of
this
injured
queen
listen
to
me
not
as
a
monarch
and
an
enemy
but
with
the
unbiased
judgment
of
man
with
man
and
then
ask
your
own
brave
heart
if
it
would
be
possible
for
sir
william
wallace
to
be
a
seducer
every
mouth
was
dumb
at
the
enunciation
of
that
name
none
dared
open
a
lip
in
accusation
and
the
king
himself
thunderstruck
alike
with
the
boldness
of
the
conqueror
venturing
within
the
grasp
of
his
revenge
and
at
the
daringness
of
bruce
in
thus
declaring
his
connection
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
knew
not
what
to
answer
only
he
had
received
conviction
of
his
wife
innocence
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
history
and
uniform
conduct
of
wallace
to
doubt
his
honor
in
this
transaction
and
though
a
transient
fancy
of
the
queen
might
have
had
existence
yet
he
had
now
no
suspicion
of
her
actions
bruce
said
he
your
honesty
has
saved
the
queen
of
england
though
wallace
is
my
enemy
i
know
him
to
be
of
an
integrity
which
neither
man
nor
woman
can
shake
and
therefore
added
he
turning
to
the
lords
i
declare
before
all
who
have
heard
me
so
fiercely
arraign
my
injured
wife
that
i
believe
her
innocent
of
every
offense
against
me
and
whoever
after
this
mentions
one
word
of
what
has
passed
in
these
investigations
or
even
whispers
that
they
have
been
held
shall
be
punished
as
guilty
of
high
treason
bruce
was
then
ordered
to
be
reconducted
to
the
and
the
rest
of
the
lords
withdrawing
by
command
the
king
was
left
with
gloucester
his
daughter
jane
and
the
now
reviving
queen
to
make
his
peace
with
her
even
on
his
knees
burce
was
more
closely
immured
than
ever
not
even
his
senachie
was
allowed
to
approach
him
and
double
guards
were
kept
constantly
around
his
prison
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
seclusion
an
extra
row
of
iron
bars
was
put
across
his
windows
he
asked
the
captain
of
the
party
the
reason
for
this
new
rivet
on
his
captivity
but
he
received
no
answer
his
own
recollection
however
solved
the
doubt
for
he
could
not
but
see
that
his
own
declaration
respecting
his
friendship
with
wallace
had
increased
the
alarm
of
edward
respecting
their
political
views
one
of
the
warders
on
having
the
same
inquiry
put
to
him
which
bruce
had
addressed
to
his
superior
in
a
rough
tone
replied
he
had
best
not
ask
questions
lest
he
should
hear
that
his
majesty
had
determined
to
keep
him
under
bishop
beck
padlock
for
life
bruce
was
not
to
be
deprived
of
hope
by
a
single
evidence
and
smiling
said
there
are
more
ways
of
getting
out
of
a
tyrant
prison
than
by
the
doors
and
windows
why
you
would
not
eat
through
the
walls
cried
the
man
certainly
replied
bruce
if
i
have
no
other
way
and
through
the
guards
too
we
see
to
that
answered
the
man
and
feel
it
too
my
sturdy
jailer
returned
the
prince
so
look
to
yourself
bruce
threw
himself
recklessly
into
a
chair
as
he
spoke
while
the
man
eying
him
askance
and
remembering
how
strangely
the
minstrel
had
disappeared
began
to
think
that
some
people
born
in
scotland
inherited
from
nature
a
necromantic
power
of
executing
whatever
they
determined
though
careless
in
his
manner
of
treating
the
warder
information
bruce
thought
of
it
with
anxiety
and
lost
in
reflections
checkered
with
hope
and
doubt
of
his
ever
effecting
an
escape
he
remained
immovable
on
the
spot
where
the
man
had
left
him
till
another
sentinel
brought
in
a
lamp
he
set
it
down
in
silence
and
withdrew
bruce
then
heard
the
bolts
on
the
outside
of
his
chamber
pushed
into
their
guards
there
they
go
said
he
to
himself
and
those
are
to
be
the
morning
and
evening
sounds
to
which
i
am
to
listen
all
my
days
at
least
edward
would
have
it
so
such
is
the
gratitude
he
shows
to
the
man
who
restored
to
him
his
wife
who
restored
to
him
the
consciousness
of
possessing
that
honor
unsullied
which
is
so
dear
to
every
married
man
well
edward
kindness
might
bind
generous
minds
even
to
forget
their
rights
but
thanks
to
you
neither
in
my
own
person
nor
for
any
of
my
name
do
i
owe
you
aught
but
to
behold
me
king
of
scotland
and
please
god
that
you
shall
if
the
prayers
of
faith
may
burst
these
gates
and
set
me
free
while
invocations
to
the
power
in
which
he
confided
and
resolutions
respecting
the
consequences
of
his
liberty
by
turns
occupied
his
mind
he
heard
the
tread
of
a
foot
in
the
adjoining
passage
he
listened
breathless
for
no
living
creature
he
thought
could
be
in
that
quarter
of
the
building
as
he
had
suffered
none
to
enter
it
since
wallace
had
disappeared
by
that
way
he
half
rose
from
his
couch
as
the
door
at
which
he
had
seen
him
last
gently
opened
he
started
up
and
gloucester
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
stood
before
him
the
earl
put
his
finger
on
his
lip
and
taking
bruce
by
the
hand
led
him
as
he
had
done
wallace
down
into
the
vault
which
leads
to
fincklay
abbey
when
safe
in
that
subterraneous
cloister
the
earl
replied
to
the
impatient
gratitude
of
bruce
who
saw
that
the
generous
gloucester
meant
he
should
follow
the
steps
of
his
friend
by
giving
him
a
succinct
account
of
his
motives
for
changing
his
first
determination
and
now
giving
him
liberty
he
had
not
visited
bruce
since
the
escape
of
wallace
that
he
might
not
excite
any
new
suspicion
in
edward
and
the
tower
being
fast
locked
at
every
usual
avenue
he
had
now
entered
it
from
the
fincklay
side
he
then
proceeded
to
inform
bruce
that
after
his
magnanimous
forgetfulness
of
his
own
safety
to
insure
that
of
the
queen
had
produced
a
reconciliation
between
her
and
her
husband
buchan
soulis
and
athol
with
one
or
two
english
lords
joined
the
next
day
to
persuade
the
king
that
bruce
avowal
respecting
wallace
had
been
merely
an
invention
of
his
own
to
screen
some
baser
friend
and
royal
mistress
they
succeeded
in
reawakening
doubts
in
edward
who
sending
for
gloucester
said
to
him
unless
i
could
hear
from
wallace
own
lips
and
in
my
case
the
thing
is
impossible
that
he
has
been
here
and
that
my
wife
is
guiltless
of
this
foul
stain
i
must
ever
remain
in
horrible
suspense
these
base
scots
ever
fertile
in
maddening
suggestions
have
made
me
even
more
suspect
that
bruce
had
other
reasons
for
his
apparently
generous
risk
of
himself
than
a
love
of
justice
while
these
ideas
floated
in
the
mind
of
edward
bruce
had
been
more
closely
immured
and
gloucester
having
received
the
promised
letter
from
wallace
determined
to
lay
it
before
the
king
accordingly
one
morning
the
earl
gliding
unobserved
into
the
before
edward
was
brought
in
laid
the
letter
under
his
majesty
cushion
as
gloucester
expected
the
moment
the
king
saw
the
superscription
he
knew
the
hand
and
hastily
breaking
the
seal
read
the
letter
twice
over
to
himself
without
speaking
a
word
but
the
clouds
which
had
hung
on
his
countenance
all
passed
away
and
with
a
smile
reaching
the
packet
to
gloucester
he
commanded
him
to
read
aloud
that
silencer
of
all
doubts
respecting
the
honor
of
margaret
of
france
and
england
gloucester
obeyed
and
the
astonished
nobles
looking
on
each
other
one
and
all
assented
to
the
credit
that
ought
to
be
given
to
word
and
deeply
regretted
having
ever
joined
in
a
suspicion
against
her
majesty
thus
then
all
appeared
amicably
settled
but
the
embers
of
discord
still
glowed
the
three
scottish
lords
afraid
lest
bruce
might
be
again
taken
into
favor
labored
to
show
that
his
friendship
with
wallace
pointed
to
his
throwing
off
the
english
yoke
and
independently
assuming
the
scottish
crown
edward
required
no
arguments
to
convince
him
of
the
probability
of
this
and
he
readily
complied
with
bishop
beck
request
to
allow
him
to
hold
the
royal
youth
his
prisoner
but
when
the
cummins
won
this
victory
over
bruce
they
gained
nothing
for
themselves
during
the
king
vain
inquiries
respecting
the
manner
in
which
wallace
letter
had
been
conveyed
to
the
apartment
they
had
ventured
to
throw
hints
of
bruce
having
been
the
agent
by
some
secret
means
and
that
however
innocent
the
queen
might
be
he
certainly
evinced
by
such
solicitude
for
her
exculpation
a
more
than
usual
interest
in
her
person
these
latter
innuendoes
the
king
crushed
in
the
first
whisper
i
have
done
enough
with
robert
bruce
said
he
he
is
condemned
a
prisoner
for
life
and
a
mere
suspicion
shall
never
provoke
me
to
give
sentence
for
his
death
irritated
by
this
reply
and
the
contemptuous
glance
with
which
it
was
accompanied
the
vindictive
triumvirate
turned
from
the
king
to
the
court
and
having
failed
in
accomplishing
the
destruction
of
bruce
and
his
more
renowned
friend
they
determined
at
least
to
make
a
wreck
of
their
moral
fame
the
guilt
of
wallace
and
the
queen
and
the
participation
of
bruce
was
now
whispered
through
every
circle
and
credited

to
the

of

the
stories

these
lords
so
basely
circulated
and
sending
for
them
he
gave
them
so
severe
a
reprimand
that
retiring
from

presence
with
stifled
wrath
they
agreed

morning
edward
was
informed
they
had
secretly
left

fearing
that
bruce
might
also
make
his
escape
a
consultation
was
held
between
the

a
complexion
that
gloucester
no

hesitated
to

rapid
course
across

country
toward
rouen
on
the
second
evening
of
his
traveling
having
pursued
his
route
without
sleep
he
felt
himself
so
overcome
with
fatigue
that
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
and
dreary
plain
he
found
it
necessary
to
stop
for
rest
at
the
first
habitation

might
find
it
happened
to
be
the
abode
of

of

poor

pious
matrons

attaching
themselves
to

live
alone

chapter
lxi
normandy
wallace
having
separated
from
the
prince
royal
of
france
pursued
his
solitary
way
toward
the
capital
of
normandy
till
night
overtook
him
ere
he
was
aware
clouds
so
obscured
the
sky
that
not
a
star
was
visible
and
his
horse
terrified
at
the
impenetrable
darkness
and
the
difficulties
of
the
path
which
lay
over
a
barren
and
stony
moor
suddenly
stopped
this
aroused
wallace
from
a
long
fit
of
musing
to
look
around
him
but
on
which
side
lay
the
road
to
rouen
he
could
form
no
guess
to
pass
the
night
in
so
exposed
a
spot
might
be
dangerous
and
spurring
the
animal
he
determined
to
push
onward
he
had
ridden
nearly
another
hour
when
the
dead
silence
of
the
scene
was
broken
by
the
roll
of
distant
thunder
then
forked
lightning
shooting
from
the
horizon
showed
a
line
of
country
unmarked
by
any
vestige
of
human
habitation
still
he
proceeded
the
storm
approached
till
breaking
in
peals
over
his
head
it
discharged
such
sheets
of
livid
fire
at
his
feet
that
the
horse
reared
and
plunging
amidst
the
blaze
flashed
the
light
of
his
rider
armor
on
the
eyes
of
a
troop
of
horsemen
who
also
stood
under
the
tempest
gazing
with
affright
at
the
scene
wallace
by
the
same
transitory
illumination
saw
the
travelers
as
they
seemed
to
start
back
at
his
appearance
and
mistaking
their
apprehension
he
called
to
them
that
his
though
terrified
steed
would
do
theirs
no
harm
one
of
them
advanced
and
respectfully
inquired
of
him
the
way
to
rouen
wallace
replied
that
he
was
a
stranger
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
was
also
seeking
that
city
while
he
was
yet
speaking
the
thunder
became
more
tremendous
and
the
lightning
rolled
in
volumes
along
the
ground
the
horses
of
the
troop
became
restive
and
one
of
them
threw
its
rider
cries
of
lamentation
mingling
with
the
groans
of
the
fallen
person
excited
the
compassion
of
wallace
he
rode
toward
the
spot
from
when
the
latter
proceeded
and
asked
the
nearest
bystander
for
several
had
alighted
whether
the
unfortunate
man
was
much
hurt
the
answer
returned
was
full
of
alarm
for
the
sufferer
and
anxiety
to
obtain
some
place
of
shelter
for
rain
began
to
fall
in
a
few
minutes
it
increased
to
torrents
and
the
lightning
ceasing
deepened
the
horrors
of
the
scene
by
preventing
the
likelihood
of
discovering
any
human
abode
the
men
gathered
round
their
fallen
companion
bewailing
the
prospect
of
his
perishing
under
these
inclemencies
but
wallace
cheered
them
by
saying
he
would
seek
a
shelter
for
their
friend
and
blow
his
bugle
when
he
had
found
one
with
the
word
he
turned
his
horse
and
as
he
galloped
along
called
aloud
on
any
christian
man
who
might
live
near
to
open
his
doors
to
a
dying
traveler
after
riding
about
in
all
directions
he
saw
a
glimmering
light
for
a
moment
and
then
all
was
darkness
but
again
he
called
aloud
for
charity
and
a
shrill
female
voice
answered
i
am
a
lone
woman
with
already
one
poor
traveler
in
my
house
but
for
the
virgin
sake
i
will
open
my
door
to
you
whatever
you
may
be
the
good
woman
relighted
her
lamp
which
the
rain
had
extinguished
and
on
her
unlatching
the
door
wallace
briefly
related
what
had
happened
entreating
her
permission
to
bring
the
unfortunate
person
into
the
cottage
she
readily
consented
and
giving
him
a
lantern
to
guide
his
way
he
blew
his
bugle
which
was
instantly
answered
by
so
glad
and
loud
a
shout
that
it
assured
him
his
companions
could
not
be
far
distant
and
that
he
must
have
made
many
a
useless
circuit
before
he
had
stopped
at
this
charitable
door
the
men
directed
him
through
the
darkness
by
their
voices
for
the
lantern
threw
its
beams
but
a
very
little
way
and
arriving
at
their
side
by
his
assistance
the
bruised
traveler
was
brought
to
the
cottage
it
was
a
poor
hovel
but
the
good
woman
had
spread
a
clean
wooden
coverlet
over
her
own
bed
in
the
inner
chamber
and
thither
wallace
carried
the
invalid
he
seemed
in
great
pain
but
his
kind
conductor
answered
their
hostess
inquiries
respecting
him
with
a
belief
that
no
bones
were
broken
but
yet
cried
she
sad
may
be
the
effects
of
internal
bruises
on
so
emaciated
a
frame
i
will
venture
to
disturb
my
other
guest
who
sleeps
in
the
loft
and
bring
down
a
decoction
that
i
keep
there
it
is
made
from
simple
herbs
and
i
am
sure
will
be
of
service
the
old
woman
having
shown
to
the
attendants
where
they
might
put
their
horses
under
shelter
of
a
shed
which
projected
from
the
cottage
ascended
a
few
steps
to
the
chamber
above
meanwhile
the
scottish
chief
assisted
by
one
of
the
men
disengaged
the
sufferer
from
his
wet
garments
and
covered
him
with
the
blankets
of
the
bed
recovered
to
recollection
by
the
comparative
comfort
of
his
bodily
feelings
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
he
fixed
them
on
wallace
then
looked
around
and
turned
to
wallace
again
generous
knight
cried
he
i
have
nothing
but
thanks
to
offer
for
this
kindness
you
seem
to
be
of
the
highest
rank
and
yet
have
succored
one
who
the
world
abjures
the
knight
returned
a
courteous
answer
and
the
invalid
in
a
paroxysm
of
emotion
added
can
it
be
possible
that
a
prince
of
france
has
dared
to
act
contrary
to
his
peers
wallace
not
apprehending
what
had
given
rise
to
this
question
supposed
the
stranger
wits
were
disordered
and
looked
with
that
inquiry
toward
the
attendant
just
at
that
moment
a
step
more
active
than
that
of
their
aged
hostess
sounded
above
and
an
exclamation
of
surprise
followed
it
in
a
voice
that
startled
wallace
he
turned
hastily
round
and
a
young
man
sprung
from
the
cottage
stairs
into
the
apartment
joy
danced
in
every
feature
and
the
ejaculation
wallace
bruce
burst
at
once
from
the
hearts
of
the
two
friends
as
they
rushed
into
each
other
arms
all
else
present
was
lost
to
them
in
the
delight
of
meeting
after
so
perilous
a
separation
a
delight
not
confined
for
its
object
to
their
individual
selves
each
saw
in
the
other
the
hope
of
scotland
and
when
they
embraced
it
was
not
merely
with
the
ardor
of
friendship
but
with
that
of
patriotism
rejoicing
in
the
preservation
of
its
chief
dependence
while
the
chiefs
spoke
freely
in
their
native
tongue
before
a
people
who
could
not
be
supposed
to
understand
them
the
aged
stranger
on
the
bed
reiterated
his
moans
wallace
in
a
few
words
telling
bruce
the
manner
of
his
reencounter
with
the
sick
man
and
his
belief
that
he
was
disordered
in
his
mind
drew
toward
the
bed
and
offered
him
some
of
the
decoction
which
the
woman
now
brought
the
invalid
drank
it
and
gazed
earnestly
first
on
wallace
and
then
on
bruce
pierre
withdraw
cried
he
to
his
personal
attendant
the
man
obeyed
sit
down
by
me
noble
friends
said
he
to
the
scottish
chiefs
and
read
a
lesson
which
i
pray
ye
lay
to
your
hearts
bruce
glanced
a
look
at
wallace
that
declared
he
was
of
his
opinion
wallace
drew
a
stool
while
his
friend
seated
himself
on
the
bed
the
old
woman
perceiving
something
extraordinary
in
the
countenance
of
the
bruised
stranger
thought
he
was
going
to
reveal
some
secret
heavy
on
his
mind
and
also
withdrew
you
think
my
intellects
are
injured
returned
he
turning
to
wallace
because
i
addressed
you
as
one
of
the
house
of
philip
those
jeweled
lilies
round
your
helmet
led
me
into
the
error
i
never
before
saw
them
granted
to
other
than
a
prince
of
the
blood
but
think
not
brave
man
i
respect
you
less
since
i
have
discovered
that
you
are
not
of
the
race
of
philip
that
you
are
other
than
a
prince
look
on
me
at
this
emaciated
form
and
behold
the
reverses
of
all
earthly
grandeur
this
palsied
hand
once
held
a
scepter
these
hollow
temples
were
once
bound
with
a
crown
he
that
used
to
be
followed
as
the
source
of
honor
as
the
fountain
of
prosperity
with
suppliants
at
his
feet
and
flatterers
at
his
side
would
now
be
left
to
solitude
were
it
not
for
these
few
faithful
servants
who
in
spite
of
all
changes
have
preserved
their
allegiance
to
the
end
look
on
me
chiefs
and
behold
him
who
was
the
king
of
scots
at
this
declaration
both
wallace
and
bruce
struck
with
surprise
and
compassion
at
meeting
their
ancient
enemy
reduced
to
such
abject
misery
with
one
impulse
bowed
their
heads
to
him
with
an
air
of
reverence
the
action
penetrated
the
heart
of
baliol
for
when
at
the
meeting
and
mutual
exclamation
of
the
two
friends
he
recognized
in
whose
presence
he
lay
he
fearfully
remembered
that
by
his
base
submissions
turning
the
scale
of
judgment
in
his
favor
he
had
defrauded
the
grandsire
of
the
very
bruce
now
before
him
of
a
fair
decision
on
his
rights
to
the
crown
and
when
he
looked
on
wallace
who
had
preserved
him
from
the
effects
of
his
accident
and
brought
him
to
a
shelter
from
the
raging
terrors
of
the
night
his
conscience
doubly
smote
him
for
from
the
hour
of
his
elevation
to
that
of
his
downfall
he
had
ever
persecuted
the
family
of
wallace
and
at
the
hour
which
was
the
crisis
of
her
fate
had
denied
them
the
right
of
drawing
their
swords
in
defense
of
scotland
he
her
king
had
resigned
her
into
the
hands
of
an
usurper
but
wallace
the
injured
wallace
had
arisen
like
a
star
of
light
on
the
deep
darkness
of
her
captivity
and
scotland
was
once
more
free
in
the
tempest
the
exiled
monarch
had
started
at
the
blaze
of
the
unknown
knight
jeweled
panoply
at
the
declaration
of
his
name
he
shrunk
before
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
falling
back
on
the
bed
he
groaned
aloud
to
these
young
men
so
strangely
brought
before
him
and
both
of
whom
he
had
wronged
he
determined
immediately
to
reveal
himself
and
see
whether
they
were
equally
resentful
of
injuries
as
those
he
had
served
had
proved
ungrateful
for
benefits
received
he
spoke
and
when
instead
of
seeing
the
pair
rise
in
indignation
on
his
pronouncing
his
name
they
bowed
their
heads
and
sat
in
respectful
silence
his
desolate
heart
expanded
at
once
to
admit
the
emotion
and
he
burst
into
tears
he
caught
the
hand
of
bruce
who
sat
nearest
to
him
and
stretching
out
the
other
to
wallace
exclaimed
i
have
not
deserved
this
goodness
from
either
of
you
perhaps
you
two
are
the
only
men
now
living
whom
i
ever
greatly
injured
and
you
excepting
my
four
poor
attendants
are
perhaps
the
only
men
living
who
would
compassionate
my
misfortunes
these
are
lessons
king
returned
wallace
with
reverence
to
fit
you
for
a
better
crown
and
never
in
my
eyes
did
the
descendant
of
alexander
seem
so
worthy
of
his
blood
the
grateful
monarch
pressed
his
hand
bruce
continued
to
gaze
on
him
with
a
thousand
awful
thoughts
occupying
his
mind
baliol
read
in
his
expressive
countenance
the
reflections
which
chained
his
tongue
behold
how
low
is
laid
the
proud
rival
of
your
grandfather
exclaimed
he
turning
to
bruce
i
compassed
a
throne
i
could
not
fill
i
mistook
the
robes
the
homage
for
the
kingly
dignity
i
bartered
the
liberties
of
my
country
for
a
crown
i
knew
not
how
to
wear
and
the
insidious
trafficker
not
only
reclaimed
it
but
repaid
me
with
a
prison
there
i
expiated
my
crime
against
the
upright
bruce
not
one
of
all
the
scottish
lords
who
crowded
edward
court
came
to
beguile
a
moment
of
sorrow
from
their
captive
monarch
lonely
i
lived
for
the
tyrant
even
deprived
me
of
the
comfort
of
seeing
my
lord
douglas
he
whom
attachment
to
my
true
interests
had
betrayed
to
an
english
prison
i
never
saw
him
after
the
day
of
his
being
put
into
the
tower
until
that
of
his
death
wallace
interrupted
the
afflicted
baliol
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
yes
added
he
i
myself
closed
his
eyes
at
that
awful
hour
he
had
petitioned
to
see
me
and
the
boon
was
granted
i
went
to
him
and
then
with
his
dying
breath
he
spoke
truths
to
me
which
were
indeed
messengers
from
heaven
they
taught
me
what
i
was
and
what
i
might
be
he
died
edward
was
then
in
flanders
and
you
brave
wallace
being
triumphant
in
scotland
and
laying
such
a
stress
in
your
negotiations
for
the
return
of
douglas
the
southron
cabinet
agreed
to
conceal
his
death
and
by
making
his
name
an
instrument
to
excite
your
hopes
and
fears
turn
your
anxiety
for
him
to
their
own
advantage
a
deep
scarlet
kindled
over
the
face
of
bruce
with
what
a
race
have
i
been
so
long
connected
what
mean
subterfuges
what
dastardly
deceits
for
the
leaders
of
a
great
nation
to
adopt
oh
king
exclaimed
he
turning
to
baliol
if
you
have
errors
to
atone
for
what
then
must
be
the
penalty
of
my
sin
for
holding
so
long
with
an
enemy
as
vile
as
he
is
ambitious
scotland
scotland
i
must
weep
tears
of
blood
for
this
he
rose
in
agitation
baliol
followed
him
with
his
eyes
amiable
bruce
you
too
severely
arraign
a
fault
that
was
venial
in
you
your
father
gave
himself
to
edward
and
his
son
accompanied
the
tribute
bruce
vehemently
answered
if
king
edward
ever
said
that
he
uttered
a
falsehood
my
father
loved
him
confided
in
him
and
the
ingrate
betrayed
him
his
fidelity
was
no
gift
of
himself
in
acknowledgment
of
inferiority
it
was
the
pledge
of
a
friendship
exchanged
on
equal
terms
on
the
fields
of
palestine
and
well
did
king
edward
know
that
he
had
no
right
over
either
my
father
or
me
for
in
the
moment
he
doubted
our
attachment
he
was
aware
of
having
forfeited
it
he
knew
he
had
no
legal
claim
on
us
and
forgetting
every
law
human
and
divine
he
made
us
prisoners
but
my
father
found
liberty
in
the
grave
and
i
am
ready
to
take
a
sure
revenge
in
he
would
have
added
scotland
but
he
forbore
to
give
the
last
blow
to
the
unhappy
baliol
by
showing
him
that
his
kingdom
had
indeed
passed
from
him
and
that
the
man
was
before
him
who
might
be
destined
to
wield
his
scepter
bruce
paused
and
sat
down
in
generous
confusion
hesitate
not
said
baliol
to
say
where
you
will
take
your
revenge
i
know
that
the
brave
wallace
has
laid
open
the
way
had
i
possessed
such
a
leader
of
my
troops
i
should
not
now
be
a
mendicant
in
this
hovel
i
should
not
be
a
creature
to
be
pitied
and
despised
wear
him
bruce
wear
him
in
your
heart
core
he
gives
the
throne
he
might
have
filled
make
not
that
a
subject
of
praise
cried
wallace
which
if
i
had
left
undone
would
have
stamped
me
a
traitor
i
have
only
performed
my
duty
and
may
the
holy
anointer
of
the
hearts
of
kings
guide
bruce
to
his
kingdom
and
keep
him
there
in
peace
and
honor
baliol
rose
in
his
bed
at
these
words
bruce
said
he
approach
me
near
he
obeyed
the
feeble
monarch
turned
to
wallace
you
have
supported
what
was
my
kingdom
through
its
last
struggles
for
liberty
put
forth
your
hand
and
support
its
exiled
sovereign
in
his
last
legal
act
wallace
raised
the
king
so
as
to
enable
him
to
assume
a
kneeling
posture
dizzy
with
the
exertion
for
a
moment
he
rested
on
the
shoulder
of
the
chief
and
then
looking
up
he
met
the
eyes
of
bruce
gazing
on
him
with
compassionate
interest
the
unhappy
monarch
stretched
out
his
arms
to
heaven
may
god
pardon
the
injuries
which
my
fatal
ambition
did
to
you
and
yours
the
miseries
i
brought
upon
my
country
and
let
your
reign
redeem
my
errors
may
the
spirit
of
wisdom
bless
you
my
son
his
hands
were
now
laid
with
pious
fervor
on
the
head
of
bruce
who
sunk
on
his
knees
before
him
whatever
rights
i
had
to
the
crown
of
scotland
by
the
worthlessness
of
my
reign
they
are
forfeited
and
i
resign
all
unto
you
even
to
the
participation
of
the
mere
title
of
king
it
has
been
as
the
ghost
of
my
former
self
as
an
accusing
spirit
to
me
but
i
trust
an
angel
of
light
to
you
it
will
conduct
your
people
into
all
happiness
exhausted
by
his
feelings
he
sunk
back
into
the
arms
of
wallace
bruce
rising
from
his
knees
poured
a
little
of
the
into
the
king
mouth
and
he
revived
as
wallace
laid
him
back
on
his
pillows
he
gazed
wistfully
at
him
and
grasping
his
hand
said
in
a
low
voice
how
did
i
throw
a
blessing
from
me
but
in
those
days
when
i
rejected
your
services
at
dunbar
i
knew
not
the
almighty
arm
which
brought
the
boy
of
ellerslie
to
save
his
country
i
scorned
the
patriot
flame
that
spoke
your
mission
and
the
mercy
of
heaven
departed
from
me
renunciation
of
baliol
in
favor
of
bruce
is
an
historical
fact
and
it
was
made
in
france
memory
was
now
busy
with
the
thoughts
of
bruce
he
remembered
his
father
weak
if
not
criminal
devotion
at
that
time
to
the
interests
of
edward
he
remembered
his
death
and
looking
at
the
desolate
old
age
of
another
of
edward
victims
his
brave
soul
melted
to
pity
and
regret
and
he
retired
into
a
distant
part
of
the
room
to
shed
unobserved
the
tears
he
could
not
restrain
wallace
soon
after
saw
the
eyes
of
the
exhausted
king
close
in
sleep
and
cautious
of
awakening
him
he
did
not
stir
but
leaning
against
the
thick
oaken
frame
of
the
bed
was
soon
lost
in
as
deep
a
repose
after
some
time
of
complete
stillness
for
the
old
dame
and
the
attendants
were
at
rest
in
the
outer
chamber
bruce
whose
low
sighs
were
echoed
by
the
wind
alone
which
swept
in
gusts
by
the
little
casement
looked
toward
the
abdicated
monarch
couch
he
slept
profoundly
yet
frequently
started
as
if
disturbed
by
troubled
dreams
wallace
moved
not
on
his
hard
pillow
and
the
serenity
of
perfect
peace
rested
upon
all
his
features
how
tranquil
is
the
sleep
of
the
virtuous
thought
bruce
as
he
contemplated
the
difference
between
his
state
and
that
of
baliol
there
lies
an
accusing
conscience
here
rests
one
of
the
most
faultless
of
created
beings
it
is
it
is
the
sleep
of
innocence
come
ye
slanderers
continued
he
mentally
calling
on
those
he
had
left
at
edward
court
and
tell
me
if
an
adulterer
could
look
thus
when
he
sleeps
is
there
one
trace
of
irregular
passion
about
that
placid
mouth
does
one
of
those
features
bear
testimony
to
emotions
which
leave
marks
even
when
subdued
no
virtue
has
set
up
her
throne
in
that
breast
and
well
may
kings
come
to
bow
to
it
chapter
lxii
the
widow
cell
the
entrance
of
the
old
woman
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
awakened
wallace
but
baliol
continued
to
sleep
on
the
chief
opening
his
eyes
bruce
with
a
smile
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
wallace
rose
and
whispering
the
widow
to
abide
by
her
guest
till
they
should
return
the
twain
went
forth
to
enjoy
the
mutual
confidence
of
friendship
a
wood
opened
its
umbrageous
arms
at
a
little
distance
and
thither
over
the
grass
they
bent
their
way
the
birds
sung
from
tree
to
tree
and
wallace
seating
himself
under
an
overhanging
beech
which
canopied
a
narrow
winding
of
the
river
seine
listened
with
mingled
pain
and
satisfaction
to
the
communications
which
bruce
had
to
impart
relative
to
the
recent
scenes
at
durham
so
rapid
had
been
the
events
observed
the
scottish
prince
when
he
concluded
his
narrative
that
all
appears
to
me
a
troubled
vision
and
blessed
indeed
was
the
awaking
of
last
night
when
your
voice
sounding
from
the
room
below
that
in
which
i
slept
called
me
to
embrace
my
best
friend
as
became
the
son
of
my
ancestors
free
and
ready
to
renew
the
brightness
of
their
name
the
discourse
next
turned
to
their
future
plans
wallace
narrating
his
adventure
with
the
red
reaver
proposed
that
the
favor
he
should
ask
in
return
the
king
of
france
being
earnest
to
bestow
on
him
some
especial
mark
of
gratitude
should
be
his
interference
with
edward
to
grant
the
scots
a
peaceable
retention
of
their
rights
in
that
case
my
prince
said
he
you
will
take
possession
of
your
kingdom
with
the
in
your
hand
bruce
smiled
but
shook
his
head
and
what
then
will
robert
bruce
be
a
king
to
be
sure
but
a
king
without
a
name
who
won
me
my
kingdom
who
accomplished
this
peace
was
it
not
william
wallace
can
i
then
consent
to
mount
the
throne
of
my
ancestors
so
poor
so
inconsiderable
a
creature
i
am
not
jealous
of
your
fame
wallace
i
glory
in
it
for
you
are
more
to
me
than
the
light
to
my
eyes
but
i
would
prove
my
right
to
the
crown
by
deeds
worthy
of
a
sovereign
till
i
have
shown
myself
in
the
field
against
scotland
enemies
i
can
not
consent
to
be
restored
to
my
inheritance
even
by
you
and
is
it
in
war
alone
returned
wallace
that
you
can
show
deeds
worthy
of
a
sovereign
think
a
moment
my
honored
prince
and
then
scorn
your
objection
look
on
the
annals
of
history
nay
on
the
daily
occurrences
of
the
world
and
see
how
many
are
brave
and
complete
generals
how
few
wise
legislators
how
few
such
efficient
rulers
as
to
procure
obedience
to
the
laws
and
so
give
happiness
to
their
people
this
is
the
commission
of
a
king
to
be
the
representative
on
earth
of
the
father
who
is
in
heaven
here
is
exercise
for
courage
for
enterprise
for
fortitude
for
every
virtue
which
elevates
the
character
of
a
man
this
is
the
godlike
jurisdiction
of
a
sovereign
to
go
to
the
field
to
lead
his
people
to
scenes
of
carnage
is
often
a
duty
in
kings
but
it
is
one
of
those
necessities
which
more
than
the
trifling
circumstances
of
sustaining
nature
by
sleep
and
food
reminds
the
conqueror
of
the
degraded
state
of
mortality
the
one
shows
the
weakness
of
the
body
the
other
the
corruption
of
the
soul
for
how
far
must
man
have
fallen
beneath
his
former
heavenly
nature
before
he
can
delight
in
the
destruction
of
his
lament
not
then
brave
and
virtuous
prince
that
i
have
kept
your
hands
from
the
stains
of
blood
show
yourself
beyond
the
vulgar
apprehension
of
what
is
fame
and
conscious
of
the
powers
with
which
the
creator
has
endowed
you
assume
your
throne
with
the
dignity
that
is
their
due
whether
it
be
to
the
cabinet
or
to
the
field
that
he
calls
you
to
act
obey
and
rely
on
it
a
name
greater
than
that
of
the
hero
of
macedon
will
await
robert
king
of
scots
the
great
one
day
said
to
his
friend
hephaestion
that
the
business
of
eating
and
drinking
compelled
him
to
remember
and
with
a
sense
of
abasement
his
mortal
nature
although
he
was
the
son
of
ammon
you
almost
persuade
me
returned
bruce
but
let
us
see
philip
and
then
i
will
decide
as
morning
was
now
advanced
the
friends
turned
toward
the
cottage
intending
to
see
baliol
safe
and
then
proceed
together
to
guienne
to
the
rescue
of
lady
helen
that
accomplished
they
would
visit
paris
and
hear
its
monarch
determination
on
entering
the
humble
mansion
they
found
baliol
awake
and
anxiously
inquiring
of
the
widow
what
was
become
of
the
two
knights
at
sight
of
them
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
both
and
said
he
should
be
able
to
travel
in
a
few
hours
wallace
proposed
sending
to
rouen
for
a
litter
to
carry
him
the
more
easily
thither
no
cried
baliol
with
a
frown
rouen
shall
never
see
me
again
within
its
walls
it
was
coming
from
thence
that
i
lost
my
way
last
night
and
though
my
poor
servants
would
gladly
have
returned
with
me
sooner
than
see
me
perish
in
the
storm
yet
rather
would
i
have
been
found
dead
on
the
road
a
reproach
to
the
kings
who
have
betrayed
me
than
have
taken
an
hour
shelter
in
that
inhospitable
city
while
the
friends
took
the
simple
breakfast
prepared
for
them
by
the
widow
baliol
related
that
in
consequence
of
the
interference
of
philip
le
bel
with
edward
he
had
been
released
from
the
tower
of
london
and
sent
to
france
but
under
an
oath
never
to
leave
that
country
philip
gave
the
exiled
king
the
castle
of
galliard
for
a
residence
where
for
some
time
he
enjoyed
the
shadow
of
royalty
having
still
a
sort
of
court
composed
of
his
own
noble
followers
some
of
whom
were
now
with
him
and
the
barons
of
the
neighborhood
philip
allowed
him
guards
and
a
splendid
table
but
on
the
peace
being
signed
between
france
and
england
in
order
that
edward
might
give
up
his
ally
the
earl
of
flanders
to
his
offended
liege
lord
the
french
monarch
consented
to
relinquish
the
cause
of
baliol
and
though
he
should
continue
to
grant
him
a
shelter
in
his
dominions
he
removed
from
him
all
the
appendages
of
a
king
accordingly
continued
baliol
the
guard
was
taken
from
my
gates
my
establishment
reduced
to
that
of
a
private
nobleman
and
no
longer
having
it
in
my
power
to
gratify
the
avidity
or
to
flatter
the
ambition
of
those
who
came
about
me
i
was
soon
left
nearly
alone
all
but
the
poor
old
lieges
whom
you
see
and
who
had
been
faithful
to
me
through
every
change
of
my
life
instantly
deserted
the
forlorn
baliol
in
vain
i
remonstrated
with
philip
either
my
letters
never
reached
him
or
he
disdained
to
answer
the
man
whose
claims
he
had
abandoned
things
were
in
this
state
when
the
other
day
and
english
lord
found
it
convenient
to
bring
his
suit
to
my
castle
i
received
him
with
hospitality
but
soon
found
that
what
i
gave
in
courtesy
he
seized
as
a
right
in
the
true
spirit
of
his
master
edward
he
treated
me
more
like
the
keeper
of
an
hostel
than
a
generous
host
and
on
my
attempting
to
plead
with
him
for
a
scottish
lady
whom
his
turbulent
passions
have
forced
from
her
country
and
reduced
to
a
pitiable
state
of
illness
he
derided
my
arguments
sarcastically
telling
me
that
had
i
taken
care
of
my
kingdom
the
door
would
not
have
been
left
open
for
him
to
steal
its
fairest
prize
wallace
interrupted
him
heaven
grant
you
may
be
speaking
of
lord
de
valence
and
lady
helen
mar
i
am
replied
baliol
they
are
now
at
galliard
and
as
her
illness
seems
a
lingering
one
de
valence
declared
to
me
his
intentions
of
continuing
there
he
seized
upon
the
best
apartments
and
carried
himself
with
so
much
haughtiness
that
provoked
beyond
endurance
i
ordered
my
horse
and
accompanied
by
my
honest
courtiers
rode
to
rouen
to
obtain
redress
from
the
governor
but
the
unworthy
frenchman
advised
me
to
go
back
and
by
flattering
de
valence
try
to
regain
the
favor
of
edward
i
retired
in
indignation
determined
to
assert
my
own
rights
in
my
own
castle
but
the
storm
overtook
me
and
being
forsaken
by
false
friends
i
am
saved
by
generous
enemies
wallace
explained
his
errand
respecting
lady
helen
and
anxiously
inquired
of
baliol
whether
he
meant
to
return
to
galliard
immediately
replied
he
go
with
me
and
if
the
lady
consents
which
i
do
not
doubt
for
she
scorns
his
prayers
for
her
hand
and
passes
night
and
day
in
tears
i
engage
to
assist
in
her
escape
baliol
then
advised
they
should
not
all
return
to
the
castle
together
the
sight
of
two
knights
of
their
appearance
accompanying
his
host
being
likely
to
alarm
de
valence
the
quietest
way
continued
the
deposed
king
is
the
surest
follow
me
at
a
short
distance
and
toward
the
shadows
of
evening
knock
at
the
gates
and
request
a
night
entertainment
i
will
grant
it
and
then
your
happy
destiny
ever
fortunate
wallace
must
do
the
rest
this
scheme
being
approved
a
litter
of
hurdles
was
formed
for
the
invalid
monarch
and
the
old
woman
pallet
spread
upon
it
i
will
return
it
to
you
my
good
widow
said
baliol
and
with
proofs
of
my
gratitude
the
two
friends
assisted
the
king
to
rise
when
he
set
his
food
on
the
floor
he
felt
so
surprisingly
better
that
he
though
he
could
ride
the
journey
wallace
overruled
this
wish
and
with
bruce
supported
his
emaciated
figure
toward
the
door
the
widow
stood
to
see
her
guests
depart
as
baliol
mounted
the
litter
he
slid
a
piece
of
gold
into
her
hand
wallace
saw
not
what
the
king
had
given
and
gave
a
purse
as
his
reward
bruce
had
naught
to
bestow
he
had
left
durham
with
little
and
that
little
was
expended
my
good
widow
said
he
i
am
poor
in
everything
but
gratitude
in
lieu
of
gold
you
must
accept
my
prayers
may
they
sweet
youth
replied
she
return
on
your
own
head
giving
you
bread
from
the
barren
land
and
water
out
of
sterile
rock
and
have
you
no
blessing
for
me
mother
asked
wallace
turning
round
and
regarding
her
with
an
impressive
look
some
spirit
you
wist
not
of
speaks
in
your
words
then
it
must
be
a
good
spirit
answered
she
for
all
around
me
betokens
gladness
the
scripture
saith
kind
to
the
wayfaring
man
for
many
have
so
entertained
angels
unawares
yesterday
at
this
time
i
was
the
poorest
of
all
the
daughters
of
charity
last
night
i
opened
my
doors
in
the
storm
you
enter
and
give
me
riches
he
follows
and
endows
me
with
his
prayers
am
i
not
then
greatly
favored
by
him
who
dispenseth
to
all
who
trust
in
him
his
mercy
and
your
goodness
shall
not
be
hidden
for
from
this
day
forth
i
will
light
a
fire
each
night
in
a
part
of
my
house
whence
it
may
be
seen
on
every
side
from
a
great
distance
like
you
princely
knight
whose
gold
will
make
it
burn
it
shall
shine
afar
and
give
light
and
comfort
to
all
who
approach
it
and
when
you
look
on
it
said
wallace
tell
your
beads
for
me
i
am
a
son
of
war
and
it
may
blaze
when
my
vital
spark
is
expiring
the
widow
paused
gazed
on
him
steadily
and
then
burst
into
tears
is
it
possible
cried
she
that
beautiful
face
may
be
laid
in
dust
that
youthful
form
lay
cold
in
clay
and
these
aged
limbs
survive
to
light
a
beacon
to
your
memory
and
it
shall
arise
it
shall
burn
like
a
holy
flame
an
incense
to
heaven
for
the
soul
of
him
who
has
succored
the
feeble
and
made
the
widow
heart
to
sing
for
joy
wallace
pressed
the
old
woman
withered
hand
bruce
did
the
same
she
saw
them
mount
their
horses
and
when
they
disappeared
from
her
eyes
she
returned
into
her
cottage
and
wept
chapter
lxiii
chateau
galliard
when
baliol
arrived
within
a
few
miles
of
chateau
galliard
he
pointed
to
a
wooded
part
of
the
forest
and
told
the
friends
that
under
its
groves
they
had
best
shelter
themselves
till
the
sun
set
soon
after
which
he
should
expect
them
at
the
castle
long
indeed
seemed
the
interval
it
usually
happens
that
in
contemplating
a
project
while
the
period
of
its
execution
appears
distant
we
think
on
it
with
composure
but
when
the
time
of
action
is
near
when
we
only
wait
the
approach
of
an
auxiliary
or
the
lapse
of
an
hour
every
passing
moment
seems
an
age
and
the
impatient
soul
is
ready
to
break
every
bound
to
grasp
the
completion
of
its
enterprise
so
wallace
now
felt
felt
as
he
had
never
done
before
for
in
all
his
warlike
exploits
each
achievement
had
immediately
followed
the
moment
of
resolve
but
here
he
was
delayed
to
grow
in
ardor
as
he
contemplated
an
essay
in
which
every
generous
principle
of
man
was
summoned
into
action
he
was
going
to
rescue
a
helpless
woman
from
the
hands
of
a
man
of
violence
she
was
also
the
daughter
of
his
first
ally
in
the
great
struggle
for
scotland
and
who
had
fallen
in
the
cause
glad
was
he
then
to
see
the
sun
sink
behind
the
distant
hills
at
that
moment
he
and
his
friend
closed
their
visors
mounted
their
horses
and
set
off
at
full
speed
toward
the
chateau
when
they
came
in
view
of
the
antique
towers
of
galliard
they
slackened
their
pace
and
leisurely
advanced
to
the
gates
the
bugle
of
wallace
demanded
admittance
a
courteous
assent
was
brought
by
the
warder
the
gates
unfolded
the
friends
entered
and
in
the
next
instant
they
were
conducted
into
a
room
where
baliol
sat
de
valence
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
a
great
chafe
he
started
at
sight
of
the
princely
armor
of
wallace
for
he
as
baliol
had
done
now
conceived
from
the
lilied
diadem
that
the
stranger
must
be
of
the
royal
house
of
france
and
composing
his
turbulent
spirit
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
supposed
prince
wallace
returned
the
salutation
and
baliol
rising
accosted
him
with
a
dignified
welcome
he
saw
the
mistake
of
de
valence
and
perceived
how
greatly
it
might
facilitate
the
execution
of
their
project
on
his
host
return
to
the
chateau
de
valence
had
received
him
with
more
than
his
former
insolence
for
the
governor
of
rouen
had
sent
him
information
of
the
despised
monarch
discontent
and
when
the
despotic
lord
hear
a
bugle
at
the
gate
and
learned
that
it
was
answered
by
the
admission
of
two
traveling
knights
he
flew
to
baliol
in
displeasure
commanding
him
to
recall
his
granted
leave
at
the
moment
of
his
wrath
wallace
entered
and
covered
him
with
confusion
struck
at
seeing
a
french
prince
in
one
of
the
persons
he
was
going
to
treat
with
such
indignity
he
shrunk
into
himself
and
bowed
before
him
with
all
the
cowering
meanness
of
a
base
and
haughty
soul
wallace
feeling
his
real
bent
his
head
in
acknowledgment
with
a
majesty
which
convinced
the
earl
that
he
was
not
mistaken
baliol
welcomed
his
guest
in
a
manner
not
to
dispel
the
illusion
happy
am
i
cried
he
that
the
hospitality
which
john
baliol
intended
to
show
to
a
mere
traveler
confers
on
him
the
distinction
of
serving
one
of
a
race
whose
favor
confers
protection
and
its
friendship
honor
wallace
returned
a
gracious
reply
to
this
speech
and
turning
to
bruce
said
this
knight
is
my
friend
and
though
from
peculiar
circumstances
neither
of
us
chooses
to
disclose
his
name
during
our
journey
yet
whatever
they
may
be
i
trust
you
will
confide
in
the
word
of
one
whom
you
have
honored
by
the
address
you
have
now
made
and
believe
that
his
friend
is
not
unworthy
the
hospitalities
of
him
who
was
once
king
of
scots
de
valence
now
approached
and
announcing
who
he
was
assured
the
knights
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
england
whom
he
was
going
to
represent
in
guienne
of
every
respect
from
himself
assistance
from
his
retinue
to
bring
them
properly
on
their
way
i
return
you
the
thanks
due
to
your
courtesy
replied
wallace
and
shall
certainly
remain
a
burden
on
king
baliol
but
in
the
morning
we
must
depart
as
we
came
having
a
vow
to
perform
which
excludes
the
service
of
attendants
a
splendid
supper
was
served
at
the
board
of
which
de
valence
sat
as
well
as
baliol
from
the
moment
that
the
strangers
entered
the
english
earl
never
withdrew
so
cautious
was
he
to
prevent
baliol
informing
his
illustrious
guests
of
the
captivity
of
lady
helen
mar
wallace
ate
nothing
he
sat
with
his
visor
still
closed
and
almost
in
profound
silence
never
speaking
but
when
spoken
to
and
then
only
answering
in
as
few
words
as
possible
de
valence
supposed
that
this
taciturnity
was
connected
with
his
vow
and
did
not
further
remark
it
but
bruce
who
at
caen
had
furnished
himself
with
a
complete
suit
of
black
armor
appeared
though
equally
invisible
under
his
visor
infinitely
more
accessible
the
humbler
fashion
of
his
martial
accouterment
did
not
announce
the
prince
but
his
carriage
was
so
noble
his
conversation
bespoke
so
accomplished
a
mind
and
brave
a
spirit
that
de
valence
did
not
doubt
that
both
men
before
him
were
of
the
royal
family
he
had
never
seen
charles
de
valois
and
believing
that
he
now
saw
him
in
wallace
he
directed
all
that
discourse
to
bruce
which
he
meant
should
reach
the
ear
of
de
valois
and
from
him
pass
to
that
of
the
king
of
france
bruce
guessed
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
with
as
much
amusement
as
design
led
forward
the
mistake
but
rather
by
allowing
him
to
deceive
himself
than
by
any
actual
means
on
his
side
to
increase
the
deception
de
valence
threw
out
hints
respecting
a
frontier
town
in
guienne
which
he
said
he
thought
his
royal
master
could
be
persuaded
to
yield
to
the
french
monarch
as
naturally
belonging
to
gascony
but
then
the
affair
must
be
properly
represented
he
added
and
had
he
motive
enough
to
investigate
some
parchments
in
his
possession
he
believed
he
could
place
the
affair
in
a
true
light
and
convince
edward
of
the
superior
claims
of
the
french
king
then
casting
out
hints
of
the
claim
he
had
by
right
of
his
ancestors
to
the
seigniory
of
valence
in
dauphiny
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
if
philip
would
invest
him
with
the
revenues
of
valence
on
the
rhone
he
would
engage
that
the
other
town
in
question
should
be
delivered
to
france
notwithstanding
baliol
resolution
to
keep
awake
and
assist
his
friends
in
their
enterprise
he
was
so
overcome
by
fatigue
that
he
fell
asleep
soon
after
supper
and
so
gave
de
valence
full
opportunity
to
unveil
his
mind
to
the
scottish
chiefs
wallace
now
saw
that
the
execution
of
his
project
must
depend
wholly
upon
himself
and
how
to
inform
helen
that
he
was
in
the
castle
and
of
his
plan
to
get
her
out
of
it
hardly
occupied
him
more
than
what
to
devise
to
detain
de
valence
in
the
while
he
went
forth
to
prosecute
his
design
as
these
thoughts
absorbed
him
by
an
unconscious
movement
he
turned
toward
the
english
earl
de
valence
paused
and
looked
at
him
supposing
he
was
going
to
speak
but
finding
him
still
silent
the
earl
addressed
him
though
with
some
hesitation
feeling
an
inexplicable
awe
of
directly
saying
to
him
what
he
had
so
easily
uttered
to
his
more
approachable
companion
i
seek
not
illustrious
stranger
said
he
to
inquire
the
name
you
have
already
intimated
must
be
concealed
but
i
have
sufficient
faith
in
that
brilliant
circlet
around
your
brows
to
be
convinced
as
none
other
than
the
royal
hand
of
philip
could
bestow
it
that
it
distinguishes
a
man
of
the
first
honor
you
now
know
my
sentiments
prince
and
for
the
advantage
of
both
kings
i
confide
them
to
your
services
wallace
rose
whether
i
am
prince
or
vassal
replied
he
my
services
shall
ever
be
given
in
the
cause
of
justice
and
of
that
earl
de
valence
you
will
be
convinced
when
next
you
hear
of
me
my
friend
cried
he
turning
to
bruce
you
will
remain
with
our
host
i
go
to
perform
the
vigils
of
my
vow
bruce
understood
him
it
was
not
merely
with
their
host
he
was
to
remain
but
to
detain
de
valence
and
opening
at
once
the
versatile
powers
of
his
abundant
mind
his
vivacity
charmed
the
earl
while
the
magnificence
of
his
views
in
policy
corroborated
to
de
valence
the
idea
that
he
was
conversing
with
one
whose
birth
had
placed
him
beyond
even
the
temptations
of
those
ambitions
which
were
at
that
moment
subjecting
his
auditor
soul
to
every
species
of
flattery
meanness
and
in
fact
disloyalty
bruce
in
his
turn
listened
with
much
apparent
interest
to
all
de
valence
dreams
of
aggrandizement
and
recollecting
his
reputation
for
a
love
of
wine
he
replenished
the
earl
goblet
so
often
that
the
fumes
made
him
forget
all
reserve
and
after
pouring
forth
the
whole
history
of
his
attachments
to
helen
and
his
resolution
to
subdue
her
abhorrence
by
love
and
grandeur
he
gradually
lowered
his
key
and
at
last
fell
fast
asleep
meanwhile
wallace
wrapped
himself
in
baliol
blue
cloak
which
lay
in
the
anteroom
and
enveloping
even
his
helmet
in
the
friendly
mantle
he
moved
swiftly
along
the
gallery
toward
the
chamber
of
helen
to
be
prepared
for
obstacles
he
had
obtained
from
baliol
a
particular
description
of
the
situation
of
every
apartment
leading
to
it
it
was
now
within
an
hour
of
midnight
he
passed
through
several
large
vacant
rooms
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
important
door
it
opened
into
a
small
chamber
in
which
two
female
attendants
lay
asleep
he
gently
raised
the
latch
and
with
caution
taking
the
lamp
which
burned
on
the
table
glided
softly
through
the
curtains
which
filled
the
cedar
arch
that
led
into
the
apartment
of
helen
he
approached
the
bed
covering
the
light
with
his
hand
while
he
observed
her
she
was
in
a
profound
sleep
but
pale
as
the
sheet
which
enveloped
her
her
countenance
seemed
troubled
her
brows
frequently
knit
themselves
and
she
started
as
she
dreamed
as
if
in
apprehension
once
he
heard
her
lips
faintly
murmur
save
me
my
father
on
you
alone
there
she
stopped
his
heart
bled
at
this
appeal
thy
father
friend
comes
to
save
thee
he
would
have
cried
but
he
checked
the
exclamation
his
hand
dropped
at
the
same
instant
from
before
the
lamp
and
the
blaze
striking
full
on
her
eyes
waked
her
she
looked
up
and
she
believed
her
dream
realized
de
valence
leaning
over
the
bed
and
herself
wholly
in
his
power
a
shriek
of
horror
as
bursting
from
her
lips
when
wallace
hastily
raised
his
visor
at
the
moment
when
despair
was
in
her
orphan
heart
and
her
whole
soul
turned
with
abhorrence
from
the
supposed
de
valence
she
met
the
eyes
of
the
dearest
to
her
on
earth
those
of
indeed
her
father
friend
stretching
forth
her
arms
for
an
instant
she
seemed
flying
to
the
protection
of
him
to
whose
honor
she
had
been
bequeathed
but
falling
back
again
on
her
bed
the
glad
surprise
of
seeing
him
who
in
her
estimation
was
her
only
earthly
security
now
that
her
father
was
no
more
shook
her
with
such
emotion
that
wallace
feared
to
see
her
delicate
frame
sink
into
some
deadly
swoon
alarmed
for
her
life
or
the
accomplishment
of
her
deliverance
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
softly
whispered
be
composed
for
the
love
of
heaven
and
your
own
safety
be
collected
and
firm
and
you
shall
fly
this
place
with
me
hardly
conscious
of
the
action
helen
grasped
the
hand
that
held
hers
and
would
have
replied
but
her
voice
failing
she
fainted
on
his
arm
wallace
now
saw
no
alternative
but
to
remove
her
hence
even
in
this
insensible
state
and
raising
her
gently
in
his
arms
enveloped
in
the
silk
coverlet
with
cautious
steps
he
bore
her
through
the
curtained
entrance
and
passed
the
sleeping
damsels
into
the
anterooms
to
meet
any
of
de
valence
men
while
in
this
situation
would
betray
ll
to
avoid
this
he
hastened
through
the
illuminated
passages
and
turning
into
the
apartment
appointed
for
himself
laid
the
now
reviving
helen
upon
a
couch
water
said
she
and
i
shall
soon
be
myself
again
he
gave
her
some
and
at
the
same
time
laying
a
page
suit
of
clothes
which
baliol
had
provided
beside
her
dress
yourself
in
these
lady
helen
said
he
i
shall
withdraw
meanwhile
into
the
passage
but
your
safety
depends
on
expedition
before
she
could
answer
he
had
disappeared
helen
instantly
threw
herself
on
her
knees
to
thank
a
higher
power
for
this
commencement
of
her
deliverance
and
to
beseech
his
blessing
on
its
consummation
she
rose
strengthened
and
obeying
wallace
the
moment
she
was
equipped
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
latch
but
the
watchful
ear
of
her
friend
heard
her
and
he
immediately
opened
the
door
the
lamps
of
the
gallery
shone
full
upon
the
light
grace
of
her
figure
as
shrinking
with
blushing
modesty
and
yet
eager
to
be
with
her
preserver
she
stood
hesitating
before
him
he
threw
his
cloak
over
her
and
putting
her
arm
through
his
in
the
unobscured
blaze
of
his
princely
armor
he
descended
to
the
lower
hall
of
the
castle
one
man
only
was
there
wallace
ordered
him
to
open
the
great
door
it
is
a
fine
night
said
he
and
i
shall
ride
some
miles
before
i
sleep
the
man
asked
if
he
were
to
saddle
the
horses
he
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
the
gate
being
immediately
unbarred
wallace
led
his
precious
charge
into
the
freedom
of
the
open
air
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
outside
of
those
towers
which
she
had
entered
as
the
worst
of
all
prisoners
her
heart
so
overflowed
with
gratitude
to
her
deliverer
that
sinking
by
his
side
upon
her
knees
she
could
only
grasp
his
hand
and
bathe
it
with
the
pure
tears
of
rescued
innocence
her
manner
penetrated
his
soul
and
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
but
she
dreading
that
she
had
perhaps
done
too
much
convulsively
articulated
my
father
his
blessing
was
a
rich
endowment
lady
helen
returned
wallace
and
you
shall
ever
find
me
deserving
of
it
her
head
leaned
on
his
breast
but
how
different
was
the
lambent
flame
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
either
heart
as
they
now
beat
against
each
other
from
the
destructive
fire
which
shot
from
the
burning
veins
of
lady
mar
when
she
would
have
polluted
with
her
unchaste
lips
this
shrine
of
a
beloved
wife
this
bosom
consecrated
to
her
sacred
image
wallace
had
shrunk
from
her
as
from
the
touch
of
some
hideous
contagion
but
with
lady
helen
it
was
soul
meeting
soul
it
was
innocence
resting
on
the
bosom
of
virtue
no
thought
that
saints
would
not
have
approved
was
there
no
emotion
which
angels
might
not
have
shared
glowed
in
their
grateful
bosoms
she
grateful
to
him
both
grateful
to
god
the
man
brought
the
horses
from
the
stable
he
knew
that
two
strangers
had
arrived
at
the
castle
and
not
noticing
helen
stature
supposed
they
were
both
before
him
he
had
been
informed
by
the
servants
that
the
taller
of
the
two
was
the
count
de
valois
and
he
now
held
the
stirrup
for
him
to
mount
but
wallace
placed
helen
on
bruce
horse
and
then
vaulting
on
his
own
put
a
piece
of
gold
into
the
hand
you
will
return
noble
prince
inquired
the
man
why
should
you
doubt
it
answered
wallace
because
replied
the
servant
i
wish
the
brother
of
the
king
of
france
to
know
the
foul
deeds
which
are
doing
in
his
dominions
by
whom
asked
wallace
surprised
at
this
address
by
the
earl
de
valence
prince
answered
he
he
has
now
in
this
castle
a
beautiful
lady
whom
he
brought
from
a
foreign
land
and
treats
in
a
manner
unbecoming
a
knight
or
a
man
and
what
would
you
have
me
do
said
wallace
willing
to
judge
whether
this
applicant
were
honest
in
his
appeal
come
in
the
power
of
your
royal
brother
answered
he
and
demand
the
lady
helen
mar
of
lord
de
valence
helen
who
had
listened
with
trepidation
to
this
dialogue
drew
nearer
wallace
and
whispered
in
an
agitated
voice
ah
let
us
hasten
away
the
man
was
close
enough
to
hear
her
hah
cried
he
in
a
burst
of
doubtful
joy
is
it
so
is
she
here
say
so
noble
knight
and
joppa
grimsby
will
serve
ye
both
forever
grimsby
cried
helen
recollecting
his
voice
the
moment
he
had
declared
his
name
what
the
honest
english
soldier
i
and
my
preserver
will
indeed
value
so
trusty
a
follower
the
name
of
grimsby
was
too
familiar
to
the
memory
of
wallace
too
closely
associated
with
his
most
cherished
meditations
for
him
not
to
recognize
it
with
melancholy
pleasure
he
had
never
seen
grimsby
but
he
knew
him
well
worthy
of
his
confidence
and
ordered
him
if
he
really
desired
to
follow
lady
helen
to
bring
two
more
horses
from
the
stables
when
they
were
brought
wallace
made
the
joyful
signal
concerted
with
bruce
and
baliol
to
sound
the
scottish
pryse
as
soon
as
he
and
his
fair
charge
were
out
of
the
castle
the
happy
tidings
met
the
ear
of
the
prince
while
anxiously
watching
the
sleeping
of
de
valence
for
fear
he
should
awake
and
leaving
the
room
interrupt
wallace
in
his
enterprise
what
then
was
his
transport
when
the
first
note
of
the
horn
burst
upon
the
silence
around
him
he
sprung
on
his
feet
the
impetuosity
of
the
action
roused
baliol
who
had
been
lying
all
the
while
sound
asleep
in
his
chair
bruce
made
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
and
pressing
his
hand
with
energy
forgot
the
former
baliol
in
the
present
and
for
a
moment
bending
his
knee
kissed
the
hand
he
held
then
rising
disappeared
in
an
instant
he
flew
through
the
open
gates
wallace
perceiving
him
rode
out
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
shone
on
his
sparkling
crest
that
was
sufficient
for
bruce
and
wallace
falling
back
again
into
the
shade
was
joined
the
next
moment
by
his
friend
who
this
friend
was
for
whom
her
deliverer
had
told
helen
he
waited
she
did
not
ask
for
she
dreaded
while
so
near
danger
to
breathe
a
word
but
she
guessed
that
it
must
either
be
murray
or
edwin
de
valence
had
barbarously
told
her
that
not
only
her
father
was
no
more
but
that
her
uncles
the
lords
bothwell
and
ruthven
had
both
been
killed
in
the
last
battle
hence
with
a
saddened
joy
one
of
her
two
bereaved
cousins
she
now
prepared
to
see
and
every
filial
recollection
pressing
on
her
heart
her
tears
flowed
silently
and
in
abundance
as
bruce
approached
his
black
mantle
so
wrapped
him
she
could
not
distinguish
his
figure
wallace
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
him
in
silence
he
grasped
it
with
the
warm
but
mute
congratulation
of
friendship
and
throwing
himself
on
his
horse
triumphantly
exclaimed
now
for
paris
helen
recognized
none
she
knew
in
that
voice
and
drawing
close
to
the
white
courser
of
wallace
with
something
like
disappointment
mingling
with
her
happier
thoughts
she
made
her
horse
keep
pace
with
the
fleetness
of
her
companions
chapter
lxiv
forest
of
vincennes
avoiding
the
frequented
track
to
paris
wallace
to
whom
grimsby
was
now
a
valuable
auxiliary
he
being
well
acquainted
with
the
country
took
a
sequestered
path
by
the
banks
of
the
marne
and
entered
the
forest
of
vincennes
just
as
the
moon
set
having
ridden
far
and
without
cessation
the
old
soldier
proposed
their
alighting
to
allow
the
lady
an
opportunity
of
reposing
awhile
under
the
trees
helen
was
indeed
nearly
exhausted
though
the
idea
of
her
happy
flight
by
inspiring
her
with
a
strength
which
surprised
even
herself
for
a
long
time
had
kept
her
insensible
to
fatigue
while
her
friends
pressed
on
with
a
speed
which
allowed
no
more
conversation
than
occasional
inquiries
of
how
she
bore
the
journey
the
swiftness
of
the
motion
and
the
rapidity
of
the
events
which
had
brought
her
from
the
most
frightful
of
situations
into
one
the
dearest
to
her
secret
and
wishes
so
bewildered
her
faculties
that
hse
almost
feared
she
was
only
enjoying
one
of
those
dreams
which
since
her
captivity
had
often
mocked
her
with
the
image
of
wallace
and
her
release
and
every
moment
she
dreaded
to
awake
and
find
herself
still
a
prisoner
to
de
valence
i
want
no
rest
replied
she
to
the
observation
of
grimsby
i
could
feel
none
till
we
are
beyond
the
possibility
of
being
overtaken
by
my
enemy
you
are
as
safe
in
this
wood
lady
returned
the
soldier
as
you
can
be
in
any
place
betwixt
galliard
and
paris
it
is
many
miles
from
the
chateau
and
lies
in
so
remote
a
direction
that
were
the
earl
to
pursue
us
i
am
sure
he
would
never
choose
this
path
and
did
he
even
come
up
with
us
dear
lady
helen
said
wallace
could
you
fear
when
with
your
father
friend
it
is
for
my
father
friend
i
fear
gently
answered
she
i
can
have
no
dread
for
myself
while
under
such
protection
a
very
little
more
persuaded
helen
and
grimsby
having
spread
his
cloak
on
the
grass
wallace
lifted
her
from
her
horse
as
soon
as
she
put
her
foot
to
the
ground
her
head
grew
giddy
and
she
must
have
fallen
but
for
the
supporting
arm
of
her
watchful
friend
he
carried
her
to
the
couch
prepared
by
the
good
soldier
and
laid
her
on
it
grimsby
had
been
more
provident
than
they
could
have
expected
for
after
saddling
the
second
pair
of
horses
he
had
returned
into
the
hall
for
his
cloak
and
taking
an
undrawn
flask
of
wine
from
the
put
it
into
his
vest
this
he
now
produced
and
wallace
made
helen
drink
some
of
it
the
cordial
soon
revived
her
and
sinking
on
her
pillow
of
leaves
she
soon
found
the
repose
her
wearied
frame
demanded
and
induced
for
fear
of
disturbing
her
not
a
word
was
spoken
wallace
watched
at
her
head
and
bruce
sat
at
her
feet
while
grimsby
remained
with
the
horses
as
a
kind
of
outpost
sweet
was
her
sleep
for
the
thoughts
with
which
she
sunk
into
slumber
occupied
her
dreams
still
she
was
riding
by
the
side
of
wallace
listening
to
his
voice
cheering
her
through
the
lengthening
way
but
some
wild
animal
in
its
nightly
prowl
crossing
before
the
horses
they
began
to
snort
and
plunge
and
though
the
no
less
terrified
alarmer
fled
far
away
it
was
with
difficulty
the
voice
and
management
of
grimsby
could
quiet
them
the
noise
suddenly
awoke
helen
and
her
scattered
faculties
not
immediately
recollecting
themselves
she
felt
an
instant
impression
that
all
had
indeed
been
a
dream
and
starting
in
affright
she
exclaimed
where
am
i
wallace
where
art
thou
here
cried
he
pressing
her
hand
with
fraternal
tenderness
i
am
here
you
are
safe
with
your
friend
and
brother
her
heart
beat
with
a
terror
which
this
assurance
could
hardly
subdue
at
last
she
said
in
an
agitated
voice
forgive
me
if
my
senses
are
a
little
strayed
i
have
suffered
so
much
and
this
release
seems
so
miraculous
that
at
moments
i
hardly
believe
it
real
i
wish
daylight
were
come
that
i
might
be
convinced
when
she
had
uttered
these
words
she
suddenly
stopped
and
then
added
but
i
am
very
weak
to
talk
thus
i
believe
my
late
terrors
have
disordered
my
head
what
you
feel
lady
is
only
natural
observed
bruce
i
experienced
the
same
when
i
first
regained
my
liberty
and
found
myself
on
the
road
to
join
sir
william
wallace
dear
indeed
is
liberty
but
dearer
is
the
friend
whose
virtues
make
our
recovered
freedom
sure
who
speaks
to
me
said
helen
in
a
low
voice
to
wallace
and
raising
her
head
from
that
now
supporting
arm
on
which
she
felt
she
did
but
too
much
delight
to
lean
one
answered
wallace
in
the
same
tone
who
is
not
to
be
publicly
known
until
occasion
demands
it
one
who
i
trust
in
god
will
one
day
seal
the
happiness
of
scotland
robert
bruce
that
name
which
when
in
her
idea
it
belonged
to
wallace
used
to
raise
such
emotions
in
her
breast
she
now
heard
with
an
indifference
that
surprised
her
but
who
could
be
more
to
scotland
than
wallace
had
been
all
that
was
in
the
power
of
patriot
or
of
king
to
do
for
his
country
he
had
done
and
what
then
was
bruce
in
her
estimation
one
who
basking
in
pleasures
while
his
country
suffered
allowed
a
brave
subject
to
breast
to
overthrow
every
danger
before
he
put
himself
forward
and
now
he
appeared
to
assume
a
throne
which
though
his
right
by
birth
he
had
most
justly
forfeited
by
neglecting
the
duties
indispensable
in
the
heir
of
so
great
and
oppressed
a
kingdom
these
would
have
been
her
thoughts
of
him
but
wallace
called
this
bruce
his
friend
and
the
few
words
she
had
heard
him
speak
being
full
of
gratitude
to
her
deliverer
that
engaged
her
esteem
the
answer
however
which
she
made
to
the
reply
of
wallace
was
spontaneous
and
it
struck
upon
the
heart
of
bruce
how
long
said
she
have
you
promised
scotland
that
it
should
see
that
day
long
to
my
grief
lady
helen
rejoined
bruce
i
would
say
to
my
shame
had
i
ever
intentionally
erred
toward
my
country
but
ignorance
of
her
state
and
of
the
depth
of
edward
treachery
was
my
crime
i
only
required
to
be
shown
the
right
path
to
pursue
it
and
sir
william
wallace
came
to
point
the
way
my
soul
lady
is
not
unworthy
the
destiny
to
which
he
calls
me
had
there
been
light
she
would
have
seen
the
flush
of
conscious
virtue
that
overspread
his
fine
countenance
while
he
spoke
but
the
words
were
sufficient
to
impress
her
with
that
respect
he
deserved
and
which
her
answer
showed
my
father
taught
me
to
consider
the
bruce
the
rightful
heirs
of
scotland
and
now
that
i
see
the
day
which
he
so
often
wished
to
hail
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
the
termination
of
scotland
woes
oh
had
it
been
before
perhaps
here
she
paused
for
tears
stopped
her
utterance
you
think
rejoined
bruce
that
much
bloodshed
might
have
been
spared
but
dear
lady
poison
not
the
comfort
of
your
life
by
that
belief
no
man
exists
who
could
have
effected
so
much
for
scotland
in
so
short
a
time
and
with
so
little
loss
as
our
wallace
has
done
who
like
him
makes
mercy
the
companion
of
war
and
compels
even
his
enemies
to
emulate
the
clemency
he
shows
fewer
have
been
slain
on
the
scottish
side
during
the
whole
of
his
struggle
with
edward
than
were
lost
by
baliol
on
the
fatal
day
of
dunbar
then
no
quarter
was
given
and
too
many
of
the
wounded
were
left
to
perish
on
the
field
but
with
wallace
life
was
granted
to
all
who
asked
the
wounded
enemy
and
the
friend
were
alike
succored
by
him
this
conduct
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
southron
generals
not
to
be
surpassed
in
generosity
and
thus
comparatively
few
have
been
lost
but
if
in
that
number
some
of
our
noblest
chiefs
we
must
be
resigned
to
yield
to
god
what
is
his
own
may
we
must
be
grateful
daughter
of
the
gallant
mar
for
the
manner
in
which
they
were
taken
they
fell
in
the
arms
of
true
glory
like
parents
defending
their
offspring
while
others
my
grandfather
and
father
perished
with
broken
hearts
in
unavailing
lamentations
that
they
could
not
share
the
fate
of
those
who
died
for
scotland
but
you
dear
bruce
returned
wallace
will
live
for
her
will
teach
those
whose
hearts
have
bled
in
her
cause
to
find
a
balm
for
every
wound
in
her
prosperity
helen
smiled
through
her
tears
at
those
words
they
spoke
the
heavenly
consolation
which
had
descended
on
her
mourning
spirit
if
scotland
be
to
rest
under
the
happy
reign
of
robert
bruce
then
envy
can
not
again
assail
sir
william
wallace
and
my
father
has
not
shed
his
blood
in
vain
his
beautified
spirit
with
those
of
my
uncles
bothwell
and
ruthven
will
rejoice
in
such
a
peace
and
i
shall
enjoy
it
to
felicity
in
so
sacred
a
participation
surprised
at
her
associating
the
name
of
lord
ruthven
with
those
who
had
fallen
wallace
interrupted
her
with
the
assurance
of
her
uncle
safety
the
scottish
chiefs
easily
understood
that
de
valence
had
given
her
the
opposite
intelligence
to
impress
her
with
an
idea
that
she
was
friendless
and
so
precipitate
her
into
the
determination
of
becoming
his
wife
but
she
did
not
repeat
to
her
brave
auditors
all
the
arguments
he
had
used
to
shake
her
impregnable
heart
impregnable
because
a
principle
kept
guard
there
which
neither
flattery
nor
ambition
could
dispossess
he
had
told
her
that
the
very
day
in
which
she
would
give
him
her
hand
king
edward
would
send
him
viceroy
into
scotland
where
she
should
reign
with
all
the
power
and
magnificence
of
a
queen
he
was
handsome
accomplished
and
adored
her
but
helen
could
not
love
him
whom
she
could
not
esteem
for
she
knew
he
was
libertine
base
and
cruel
that
he
loved
her
affected
her
not
she
could
only
be
sensible
to
an
affection
placed
on
worthy
foundations
and
he
who
trampled
on
all
virtues
in
his
own
actions
could
not
desire
them
when
seen
in
her
he
therefore
must
love
her
for
the
fairness
of
her
form
alone
and
to
place
any
value
on
such
affection
was
to
grasp
the
wind
personal
flatteries
having
made
no
impression
on
helen
ambitious
projects
were
attempted
with
equal
failure
had
de
valence
been
lord
of
the
eastern
and
western
empires
could
he
have
made
her
the
envy
and
admiration
of
a
congregated
world
all
would
have
been
in
vain
she
had
seen
and
known
the
virtues
of
sir
william
wallace
and
from
that
hour
all
that
was
excellent
in
man
and
all
that
was
desirable
on
earth
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
him
summed
up
on
the
barren
heath
said
she
to
herself
in
some
desert
island
with
only
thee
and
thy
virtues
how
happy
could
be
helen
mar
how
great
for
to
share
thy
heart
thy
noble
glorious
heart
would
be
a
bliss
a
seal
of
honor
from
heaven
with
which
no
terrestrial
elevation
could
compare
then
would
she
sigh
capable
of
appreciating
and
loving
above
all
earthly
things
the
matchless
virtues
of
sir
william
wallace
on
the
very
evening
of
the
night
in
question
in
which
he
had
so
unexpectedly
appeared
to
release
her
her
thoughts
had
been
engaged
in
this
train
yes
cried
she
to
herself
even
in
loving
thy
perfections
there
is
such
enjoyment
that
i
would
rather
be
as
i
am
what
others
might
call
the
hopeless
helen
than
the
loving
and
beloved
of
any
other
man
on
earth
in
thee
i
love
virtue
and
the
imperishable
sentiment
will
bless
me
in
the
world
to
come
with
these
thoughts
she
had
fallen
asleep
she
dreamed
that
she
called
on
her
father
on
wallace
to
save
her
and
on
opening
her
eyes
she
had
found
him
indeed
near
every
word
which
this
almost
adored
friend
now
said
to
comfort
her
with
regard
to
her
own
immediate
losses
to
assure
her
of
the
peace
of
scotland
should
heaven
bless
the
return
of
bruce
took
root
in
her
soul
and
sprung
up
into
resignation
and
happiness
she
listened
to
the
plans
of
wallace
and
of
bruce
to
effect
their
great
enterprise
and
the
hours
of
the
night
passed
to
her
not
only
in
repose
but
in
enjoyment
wallace
though
pleased
with
the
interest
she
took
in
even
the
minutest
details
of
their
design
became
fearful
of
overtasking
her
weakened
frame
he
whispered
bruce
to
gradually
drop
the
conversation
and
as
it
died
away
slumber
again
stole
over
her
eyelids
the
dawn
had
spread
far
over
the
sky
while
she
yet
slept
wallace
sat
contemplating
her
and
the
now
sleeping
bruce
who
had
also
imperceptibly
sunk
to
rest
various
and
anxious
were
his
meditations
he
had
hardly
seen
years
yet
so
had
he
been
tried
in
the
vicissitudes
of
life
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
lived
a
century
and
instead
of
looking
on
the
lovely
helen
as
on
one
whose
charms
might
claim
a
lover
lovely
helen
as
on
one
whose
charms
might
claim
a
lover
wishes
in
his
breast
he
regarded
her
with
sentiments
more
like
parental
tenderness
that
indeed
seemed
the
affection
which
now
reigned
in
his
bosom
he
felt
as
a
father
toward
scotland
for
every
son
and
daughter
of
that
harassed
country
he
was
ready
to
lay
down
his
life
edwin
he
cherished
in
his
heart
as
he
would
have
done
the
dearest
of
his
own
offspring
it
was
as
a
parent
to
whom
a
beloved
and
prodigal
son
had
returned
that
he
looked
on
bruce
but
helen
of
all
scotland
daughters
she
was
the
most
precious
in
his
eyes
set
love
aside
and
no
object
without
the
touch
of
that
passion
could
he
regard
with
more
endearing
tenderness
than
he
did
helen
mar
the
shades
of
night
vanished
before
the
bright
uprise
of
the
king
of
day
and
with
them
her
slumbers
she
stirred
she
awoke
the
lark
was
then
soaring
with
shrill
cadence
over
her
head
its
notes
pierced
the
ear
of
bruce
and
he
started
on
his
feet
you
have
allowed
me
to
sleep
wallace
and
why
not
replied
he
here
it
was
safe
for
all
to
have
slept
yet
had
there
been
danger
i
was
at
my
post
to
have
called
you
he
gently
smiled
as
he
spoke
whence
my
friend
cried
bruce
with
a
respondent
beam
on
his
countenance
did
you
draw
the
ethereal
essence
that
animates
your
frame
you
toil
for
us
watch
for
us
and
yet
you
never
seem
fatigued
never
discomposed
how
is
this
what
does
it
mean
that
the
soul
is
immortal
answered
wallace
that
it
has
a
godlike
power
given
to
it
by
the
giver
of
all
good
even
while
on
earth
to
subdue
the
wants
of
this
mortal
frame
the
circumstances
in
which
heaven
has
cast
me
have
disciplined
my
circumstances
in
which
heaven
has
cast
me
have
disciplined
my
body
to
obey
my
mind
in
all
things
and
therefore
when
the
motives
for
exertion
are
strong
within
me
it
is
long
very
long
before
i
feel
hunger
thirst
or
drowsiness
indeed
while
thus
occupied
i
have
often
thought
it
possible
for
the
activity
of
the
soul
so
to
wear
the
body
that
some
day
she
might
find
it
suddenly
fall
away
from
about
her
spiritual
substance
and
leave
her
unencumbered
without
having
felt
the
touch
of
death
and
yet
that
change
continued
wallace
following
up
on
his
own
thought
could
not
be
till
heaven
sees
the
appointed
time
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
neither
by
sleep
nor
any
species
of
refreshment
his
spirit
alone
who
created
all
things
can
give
us
a
rest
while
we
keep
the
strictest
vigils
his
power
can
sustain
the
wasting
frame
even
in
a
barren
wilderness
true
replied
helen
looking
timidly
up
but
because
heaven
is
so
gracious
as
sometimes
to
work
miracles
in
our
favor
surely
we
are
not
authorized
to
neglect
the
natural
means
of
obtaining
the
same
end
certainly
not
returned
wallace
it
is
not
for
man
to
tempt
god
at
any
time
sufficient
for
us
it
is
to
abide
by
his
dispensations
when
we
are
in
circumstances
that
allow
the
usual
means
of
life
it
is
demanded
of
us
to
use
them
but
when
we
are
brought
into
situations
where
watching
fasting
and
uncommon
toils
are
not
to
be
avoided
then
it
is
an
essential
part
of
our
obedience
to
perform
our
duties
to
the
end
without
any
regard
to
the
wants
which
may
impede
our
way
it
is
in
such
an
hour
when
the
soul
of
man
resolved
to
obey
looks
down
on
human
nature
and
looks
up
to
god
that
he
receives
both
the
manna
and
the
waters
of
heaven
by
this
faith
and
perseverance
the
uplifted
hands
of
moses
prevailed
over
amalek
in
rephidim
and
by
the
same
did
the
lengthened
race
of
the
sun
light
joshua
to
a
double
victory
in
gibeon
the
morning
vapors
having
dispersed
from
the
opposite
plain
and
helen
being
refreshed
by
her
long
repose
wallace
seated
her
on
horseback
and
they
recommenced
their
journey
the
helmets
of
both
chiefs
were
now
open
grimsby
looked
at
one
and
the
other
the
countenances
of
both
assured
him
that
he
should
find
a
protector
in
either
he
drew
toward
helen
she
noticed
his
manner
and
observing
to
wallace
that
she
believed
the
soldier
wished
to
speak
with
her
checked
her
horse
at
this
action
grimsby
presumed
to
ride
up
and
bowing
respectfully
said
that
before
he
followed
her
to
paris
it
would
be
right
for
the
count
de
valois
to
know
whom
he
had
taken
into
his
train
one
madam
who
has
been
degraded
by
king
edward
degraded
added
he
but
not
debased
that
last
disgrace
depends
on
myself
and
i
should
shrink
from
your
protection
rather
than
court
it
were
i
indeed
vile
you
have
too
well
proved
your
integrity
grimsby
replied
helen
to
doubt
it
now
but
what
has
the
count
de
valois
to
do
with
your
being
under
my
protection
it
is
not
to
him
we
go
but
to
the
french
king
and
is
not
that
knight
with
the
diadem
inquired
grimsby
the
count
de
valois
the
servants
at
chateau
galliard
told
me
he
was
so
surprised
at
this
helen
said
the
knight
should
answer
for
himself
and
quickening
the
step
of
her
horse
followed
by
grimsby
rejoined
his
side
when
she
informed
wallace
of
what
had
passed
he
called
the
soldier
to
approach
grimsby
said
he
you
have
claims
upon
me
which
should
insure
you
my
protection
were
i
even
insensible
to
the
honorable
principles
you
have
just
declared
to
lady
helen
but
i
repeat
i
am
already
your
friend
you
have
only
to
speak
and
all
in
my
power
to
serve
you
shall
be
done
then
sir
returned
he
as
mine
is
rather
a
melancholy
story
and
parts
of
it
have
already
drawn
tears
from
lady
helen
if
you
will
honor
me
with
your
attention
apart
from
her
i
would
relate
how
i
fell
into
disgrace
with
my
sovereign
wallace
fell
a
little
back
with
grimsby
and
while
bruce
and
helen
rode
briskly
forward
he
at
a
slower
pace
prepared
to
listen
to
the
recapitulation
of
scenes
in
which
he
was
only
too
deeply
interested
the
soldier
began
by
narrating
the
fatal
events
at
ellerslie
which
had
compelled
him
to
leave
the
army
in
scotland
he
related
that
after
quitting
the
priory
of
fillan
he
reached
guienne
and
there
served
under
the
earl
of
lincoln
until
the
marriage
of
edward
with
king
philip
sister
gave
the
english
monarch
quiet
possession
of
that
province
grimsby
then
marched
with
the
rest
of
the
troops
to
join
their
sovereign
in
flanders
there
he
was
recognized
and
brought
to
judgment
by
one
of
heselrigge
captains
one
who
had
been
a
particular
favorite
with
the
tyrant
from
their
similarity
of
disposition
and
to
whom
he
had
told
the
mutiny
and
desertion
as
he
called
it
of
grimsby
but
on
the
presentation
of
the
earl
of
lincoln
his
punishment
was
mitigated
from
death
to
the
infliction
of
a
certain
number
of
lashes
this
sentence
which
the
honest
officer
regarded
as
worse
than
the
loss
of
life
was
executed
on
stripping
him
at
the
halberts
lady
gift
the
diamond
clasp
was
found
hanging
round
his
neck
this
was
seized
as
a
proof
of
some
new
crime
his
general
now
gave
him
up
and
so
inconsistent
were
his
judges
that
while
they
allowed
this
treason
for
so
they
stigmatized
his
manly
resentment
of
heselrigge
cruelty
to
prejudice
them
in
this
second
charge
they
would
not
believe
what
was
so
probable
that
this
very
jewel
had
been
given
to
him
by
a
friend
of
sir
william
wallace
in
reward
for
his
behavior
on
that
occasion
he
appealed
to
edward
but
he
appealed
in
vain
and
on
the
following
day
he
was
adjudged
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
for
the
supposed
robbery
every
heart
was
callous
to
his
sufferings
but
that
of
the
wife
of
his
jailer
who
fancying
him
like
a
brother
of
hers
who
had
been
killed
ten
years
before
in
italy
at
the
dead
of
the
night
she
opened
his
prison
doors
he
fled
into
normandy
and
without
a
home
outlawed
branded
as
a
traitor
and
a
thief
he
was
wandering
one
stormy
night
on
the
banks
of
the
marne
when
a
cry
of
distress
attracted
his
attention
it
issued
from
the
suit
of
de
valence
on
his
way
to
guienne
scared
at
the
tempest
the
female
attendants
of
lady
helen
had
abandoned
themselves
to
shrieks
of
despair
but
she
insensible
to
anything
but
grief
lay
in
perfect
stillness
in
the
litter
that
conveyed
her
as
grimsby
approached
the
travelers
de
valence
demanded
his
assistance
to
conduct
them
to
a
place
of
shelter
chateau
galliard
was
the
nearest
residence
fit
to
receive
the
earl
and
his
train
thither
the
soldier
led
them
and
heard
from
the
servants
that
the
lady
in
the
vehicle
was
their
lord
wife
and
a
lunatic
grimsby
remained
in
the
chateau
because
he
had
nowhere
else
to
go
and
by
accidental
speeches
from
the
lady
attendants
soon
found
that
she
was
not
married
to
the
earl
and
was
not
only
perfectly
sane
but
often
most
cruelly
treated
her
name
he
had
never
learned
until
the
last
evening
when
carrying
some
wine
into
the
he
heard
de
valence
mention
it
to
the
other
stranger
knight
he
then
retired
full
of
horror
resolving
to
essay
her
rescue
himself
but
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
two
knights
in
the
hall
determined
him
to
reveal
the
case
to
them
this
added
grimsby
is
my
story
and
whoever
you
are
noble
lord
if
you
think
me
not
unworthy
your
protection
grant
it
and
you
shall
find
me
faithful
unto
death
i
owe
you
that
and
more
replied
the
chief
i
am
that
wallace
on
whose
account
you
fled
your
country
and
if
you
be
willing
to
share
the
fortunes
of
one
who
may
live
and
die
in
camps
i
pledge
you
that
my
best
destiny
shall
be
yours
could
grimsby
in
his
joyful
surprise
have
thrown
himself
at
the
feet
of
wallace
he
would
have
done
so
but
taking
hold
of
the
end
of
his
scarf
he
pressed
it
enthusiastically
to
his
lips
and
exclaimed
bravest
of
the
brave
this
is
beyond
my
prayers
to
meet
here
the
triumphant
lord
of
scotland
i
fell
innocently
into
disgrace
ah
how
am
i
now
exalted
unto
honor
my
country
would
have
deprived
me
of
life
i
am
therefore
dead
to
it
and
live
only
to
gratitude
and
you
then
replied
wallace
as
the
first
proof
of
the
confidence
i
repose
in
you
know
that
the
young
chief
who
is
riding
forward
with
lady
helen
is
robert
bruce
the
prince
of
scotland
our
next
enterprise
is
to
place
him
upon
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
meanwhile
till
we
license
you
to
do
otherwise
keep
our
names
a
secret
and
call
us
by
those
we
may
hereafter
think
fit
to
assume
grimsby
once
more
reinstated
in
the
station
he
deserved
that
of
trust
and
respect
no
longer
hung
his
head
in
abject
despondency
but
looking
erect
as
one
born
again
from
disgrace
he
became
the
active
cheerful
and
faithful
servant
of
wallace
during
wallace
conversation
with
the
soldier
helen
was
listening
with
delight
to
the
encomiums
which
bruce
passed
upon
his
friend
and
champion
as
his
eloquent
tongue
described
the
merits
of
wallace
and
expressed
an
ardent
gratitude
for
his
having
so
gloriously
supplied
his
place
to
scotland
helen
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
prince
before
she
had
scarcely
remarked
that
he
was
more
than
young
and
handsome
but
now
while
she
contemplated
the
noble
confidence
which
breathed
in
every
feature
she
said
to
herself
this
man
is
worthy
to
be
the
friend
of
wallace
his
soul
is
a
mirror
to
reflect
all
the
brightness
of
wallace
ay
like
as
with
the
sun
rays
to
kindle
with
fire
all
on
whom
it
turns
bruce
remarked
the
unusual
animation
of
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
you
feel
all
i
say
of
wallace
said
he
and
it
was
not
a
charge
at
which
she
need
blush
it
was
addressed
to
that
perception
of
exalted
worth
which
regards
neither
sex
nor
age
helen
did
not
misapprehend
him
the
amiable
frankness
of
his
manner
seemed
to
open
to
him
her
heart
wallace
she
adored
almost
as
a
god
bruce
she
could
love
as
a
brother
it
requires
not
time
nor
proof
to
make
virtuous
hearts
coalesce
there
is
a
language
without
sounds
a
recognition
independent
of
the
visual
organ
which
acknowledges
the
kindred
of
congenial
souls
almost
in
the
moment
they
meet
the
virtuous
mind
knoweth
its
brother
in
the
dark
this
was
said
by
the
man
whose
soul
sympathized
in
every
noble
purpose
with
that
of
wallace
while
helen
impelled
by
the
same
principle
and
blushing
with
an
emotion
untainted
by
any
sensation
of
shame
replied
i
am
too
grateful
to
heaven
for
having
allowed
me
to
witness
the
goodness
to
share
the
esteem
of
such
a
being
a
man
whose
like
i
have
never
seen
he
is
one
of
the
few
lady
helen
replied
bruce
who
is
worthy
of
so
august
a
title
and
he
brightly
shows
the
image
in
which
he
was
made
so
humble
so
dignified
so
great
so
lowly
so
in
all
accomplishments
of
mind
and
body
wise
brave
and
invincible
yet
forbearing
gentle
and
unassuming
formed
to
be
beloved
yet
without
a
touch
of
vanity
loving
all
who
approach
him
without
the
least
alloy
of
passion
ah
lady
helen
he
is
a
model
after
which
i
will
fashion
my
life
for
he
has
written
the
character
of
the
son
of
god
in
his
heart
and
it
shall
be
my
study
to
transcribe
the
blessed
copy
into
mine
tears
of
gratitude
glittered
in
the
eye
and
on
the
smile
of
helen
to
answer
bruce
she
found
to
be
impossible
but
that
her
smile
and
look
were
appreciated
by
him
his
own
told
her
and
stretching
out
his
hand
to
her
as
she
put
hers
into
his
he
said
we
are
united
in
his
heart
my
sweet
friend
at
this
moment
wallace
joined
them
he
saw
the
action
and
the
animation
on
each
countenance
and
looked
at
bruce
with
a
glance
of
inquiry
but
bruce
perceived
nothing
of
a
lover
jealousy
in
the
look
it
carried
the
wish
of
a
friend
to
share
what
had
impressed
them
with
such
happy
traits
we
have
been
talking
of
you
returned
the
prince
and
if
to
be
beloved
is
a
source
of
joy
you
must
be
peculiarly
blessed
the
affections
of
lady
helen
and
myself
have
met
and
made
your
heart
the
altar
on
which
we
have
pledged
our
fraternal
love
wallace
regarded
each
with
a
look
of
tenderness
it
is
my
joy
to
love
you
both
like
a
brother
but
lady
helen
must
consider
me
as
even
more
than
that
to
her
i
am
her
father
representative
i
am
the
voice
of
grateful
scotland
thanking
her
for
the
preservation
her
generous
exertions
yielded
and
to
you
my
prince
i
am
your
friend
your
subject
all
that
is
devoted
and
true
thus
enjoying
the
dear
communion
of
hearts
the
interchange
of
mind
and
mingling
soul
with
soul
did
these
three
friends
journey
toward
the
gates
of
paris
every
hour
seemed
an
age
of
blessedness
to
helen
so
gratefully
did
she
enjoy
each
passing
moment
of
a
happiness
that
seemed
to
speak
of
paradise
nature
never
before
appeared
so
beautiful
in
her
eyes
the
sky
was
more
serene
the
birds
sung
with
sweeter
notes
the
landscape
shone
in
brighter
charms
the
fragrances
of
the
flowers
bathed
her
senses
in
the
softest
balm
and
the
very
air
as
it
breathed
around
her
seemed
fraught
with
life
and
joy
but
wallace
animated
the
scene
and
while
she
fancied
that
she
inhaled
his
breath
in
every
respiration
she
moved
as
if
on
enchanted
ground
oh
she
could
have
lingered
there
forever
and
hardly
did
she
know
what
it
was
to
draw
any
but
sighs
of
bliss
till
she
saw
the
towers
of
paris
embattling
the
horizon
they
reminded
her
that
she
was
now
going
to
be
occasionally
divided
from
him
that
when
entered
within
those
walls
it
would
no
longer
be
decorous
for
her
to
pass
days
and
nights
in
listening
to
his
voice
in
losing
all
of
woman
love
in
the
beautified
affection
of
an
angel
this
passion
of
the
soul
if
such
it
may
be
called
which
has
its
rise
in
virtue
and
its
aim
the
same
would
be
most
unjustly
degraded
were
it
classed
with
what
the
herd
generally
entitle
love
the
love
which
men
stigmatize
deride
and
yet
encourage
is
a
fancy
an
infatuation
awakened
by
personal
attraction
by
the
lover
knows
not
what
sometimes
by
gratified
vanity
sometimes
by
idleness
and
often
by
the
most
debasing
propensities
of
human
nature
earthly
it
is
and
unto
earth
it
shall
return
but
love
true
love
that
pure
affection
which
unites
congenial
spirits
here
and
with
which
the
creator
will
hereafter
connect
in
one
blessed
fraternity
the
whole
kindred
of
mankind
has
but
one
cause
the
universal
unchangeableness
and
immortality
a
something
so
excellent
that
the
simple
wish
to
partake
its
essence
in
the
union
of
affection
to
facilitate
and
to
share
its
attainment
of
true
and
lasting
happiness
invigorates
our
virtue
and
inspires
our
souls
these
are
the
aims
and
joys
of
real
love
it
has
nothing
selfish
in
every
desire
it
soars
above
this
earth
and
anticipates
as
the
ultimatum
of
its
joy
the
moment
when
it
shall
meet
its
partner
before
the
throne
of
god
such
was
the
sentiment
of
helen
toward
wallace
so
unlike
what
she
had
seen
in
others
of
the
universal
passion
she
would
hardly
have
acknowledged
to
herself
that
what
she
felt
was
love
had
not
the
anticipation
of
even
an
hour
separation
from
him
whispered
the
secret
to
her
heart
chapter
lxv
paris
when
they
were
arrived
within
a
short
distance
from
paris
wallace
wrote
a
few
lines
to
king
philip
informing
him
who
were
the
companions
of
his
journey
and
that
he
would
rest
near
the
abbey
of
genevieve
until
he
should
receive
his
majesty
greetings
to
bruce
also
the
queen
granted
protection
for
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
mar
grimsby
was
the
bearer
of
this
letter
he
soon
returned
with
an
escort
of
honor
accompanied
by
prince
louis
himself
at
sight
of
wallace
he
flew
into
his
arms
and
after
embracing
him
again
and
again
with
all
the
unchecked
ardor
of
youthful
gratitude
he
presented
to
him
a
packet
from
the
king
it
expressed
the
satisfaction
of
philip
at
the
near
prospect
of
his
seeing
the
man
whom
he
had
so
long
admired
and
whose
valor
had
wrought
him
such
service
as
the
preservation
of
his
son
he
then
added
that
he
had
other
matters
to
thank
him
for
when
they
should
meet
and
subjects
to
discuss
which
would
be
much
elucidated
by
the
presence
of
bruce
according
to
your
request
continued
he
the
name
of
neither
shall
be
made
public
at
my
court
my
own
family
only
know
who
are
to
be
my
illustrious
guests
the
queen
is
impatient
to
bid
them
welcome
and
no
less
eager
to
greet
the
lady
helen
mar
with
her
friendship
and
protection
a
beautiful
palfrey
superbly
caparisoned
and
tossing
its
fair
neck
amid
the
pride
of
its
gorgeous
chamfraine
was
led
forward
by
a
page
two
ladies
also
bearing
rich
apparel
for
helen
appeared
in
the
train
when
their
errand
was
made
known
to
wallace
he
communicated
it
to
helen
her
delicacy
indeed
wished
to
lay
aside
her
page
apparel
before
she
was
presented
to
the
queen
but
she
had
been
so
happy
while
she
wore
it
days
have
passed
with
me
in
these
garments
said
she
to
herself
which
may
never
occur
again
the
laddies
were
conducted
to
her
they
delivered
a
gracious
message
from
their
royal
mistress
and
opened
the
caskets
helen
sighed
she
could
urge
nothing
in
opposition
to
their
embassy
and
reluctantly
assented
to
the
change
they
were
to
make
in
her
appearance
she
stood
mute
while
they
disarrayed
her
of
her
humble
guise
and
clothed
her
in
the
robes
of
france
during
their
attendance
in
the
adulatory
strains
of
the
court
they
broke
out
in
encomiums
on
the
graces
of
her
person
but
to
all
this
she
turned
an
inattentive
ear
her
mind
was
absorbed
in
what
she
had
enjoyed
in
the
splendid
penance
she
might
now
undergo
one
of
the
women
was
throwing
the
page
clothes
carelessly
into
a
bag
when
helen
perceiving
her
with
eagerness
cried
take
care
of
that
suit
it
is
more
precious
to
me
than
gold
or
jewels
indeed
answered
the
attendant
more
respectfully
folding
it
it
does
not
seem
of
very
rich
silk
probably
not
returned
helen
but
it
is
valuable
to
me
and
wherever
i
lodge
i
will
thank
you
to
put
it
into
my
apartment
a
mirror
was
now
presented
that
she
might
see
herself
she
started
at
the
load
of
jewels
with
which
they
had
adorned
her
and
while
tears
filled
her
eyes
she
mildly
said
i
am
a
mourner
and
these
ornaments
must
not
be
worn
by
me
the
ladies
obeyed
her
wish
to
have
them
taken
off
and
with
thoughts
divided
between
her
father
and
her
father
friend
she
was
conducted
toward
the
palfrey
wallace
approached
her
and
bruce
flew
forward
with
his
usual
haste
to
assist
her
but
it
was
no
longer
the
beautiful
little
page
that
met
his
view
the
confidential
and
frank
glance
of
a
youthful
brother
it
was
a
lovely
woman
arrayed
in
all
the
charms
of
female
apparel
trembling
and
blushing
as
she
again
appeared
as
a
woman
before
the
eyes
of
the
man
she
loved
wallace
sighed
as
he
touched
her
hand
for
there
was
something
in
her
air
which
seemed
to
say
i
am
not
what
i
was
a
few
minutes
ago
it
was
the
aspect
of
the
world
austerity
the
decorum
of
rank
and
situation
but
not
of
the
heart
that
had
never
been
absent
from
the
conduct
of
helen
had
she
been
in
the
wilds
of
africa
with
no
other
companion
than
wallace
still
would
those
chaste
reserves
which
lived
in
her
soul
have
been
there
the
guardian
of
her
actions
for
modesty
was
as
much
the
attribute
of
her
person
as
magnanimity
the
character
of
her
mind
her
more
distant
air
at
this
time
was
the
effect
of
reflections
while
in
the
abbey
where
he
had
lodged
her
she
saw
that
the
frank
intercourse
between
them
was
to
be
interrupted
by
the
forms
of
a
court
and
her
manner
insensibly
assumed
the
demeanor
she
was
so
soon
to
wear
bruce
looked
at
her
with
delighted
wonder
he
had
before
admired
her
as
beautiful
he
now
gazed
on
her
as
transcendently
so
he
checked
himself
in
his
swift
step
he
paused
to
look
on
her
and
wallace
and
contemplating
them
with
sentiments
of
unmingled
admiration
this
exclamation
unconsciously
escaped
him
how
lovely
he
could
not
but
wish
to
see
two
such
perfectly
amiable
and
perfectly
beautiful
beings
united
as
closely
by
the
bonds
of
the
altar
as
he
believed
they
were
in
heart
and
he
longed
for
the
hour
when
he
might
endow
them
with
those
proofs
of
his
fraternal
love
which
should
class
them
with
the
first
of
scottish
princes
but
how
thought
he
can
i
ever
sufficiently
reward
thee
wallace
for
what
thou
hast
done
for
me
and
mine
thy
services
are
beyond
all
price
thy
soul
is
above
even
empires
then
how
can
i
show
thee
all
that
is
in
my
heart
for
thee
while
he
thus
apostrophized
his
friend
wallace
and
helen
advanced
toward
him
bruce
held
out
his
hand
to
her
with
a
cordial
smile
lady
helen
we
are
still
to
be
the
same
robes
of
no
kind
must
ever
separate
the
affections
born
in
our
pilgrimage
she
put
her
hand
into
his
with
a
glow
of
delight
while
sir
william
wallace
allows
me
to
call
him
brother
answered
she
that
will
ever
be
a
sanction
to
our
friendship
but
courts
are
formal
places
and
i
now
go
to
one
and
i
will
soon
remove
you
to
another
replied
he
where
he
hesitated
looked
at
wallace
and
then
resumed
where
every
wish
of
my
sister
helen
heart
shall
be
gratified
or
i
be
no
king
helen
blushed
deeply
and
hastened
toward
the
palfrey
wallace
placed
her
on
the
embroidered
saddle
and
prince
louis
preceding
the
cavalcade
it
moved
on
as
bruce
vaulted
into
his
seat
he
said
something
to
his
friend
of
the
perfectly
feminine
beauty
of
helen
but
her
soul
is
fairer
returned
wallace
the
prince
of
scotland
with
a
gay
but
tender
smile
softly
whispered
fair
doubly
fair
to
you
wallace
drew
a
deep
sigh
i
never
knew
but
one
woman
who
resembled
her
and
she
did
indeed
excel
all
of
created
mold
from
infancy
to
manhood
i
read
every
thought
of
her
angelic
heart
i
became
the
purer
by
the
study
and
i
loved
my
model
with
an
idolatrous
adoration
there
was
my
error
but
those
sympathies
those
hours
are
past
my
heart
will
never
throb
as
it
has
throbbed
never
rejoice
as
it
has
rejoiced
for
she
who
lived
but
for
me
who
doubled
all
my
joys
is
gone
oh
my
prince
though
blessed
with
friendship
there
are
times
when
i
feel
that
i
am
solitary
bruce
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
solitary
wallace
can
you
ever
be
solitary
and
near
helen
of
mar
perhaps
more
so
then
than
at
any
other
time
for
her
beauties
her
excellences
remind
me
of
what
were
once
mine
and
recall
every
regret
oh
bruce
thou
canst
not
comprehend
my
loss
to
mingle
thought
with
thought
and
soul
with
soul
for
years
and
then
after
blending
our
very
beings
and
feeling
as
if
indeed
made
one
to
be
separated
and
by
a
stroke
of
violence
this
was
a
trial
of
the
spirit
which
but
for
heaven
mercy
would
have
crushed
me
i
live
but
still
my
heart
will
mourn
mourn
her
i
have
lost
and
mourn
that
my
rebellious
nature
will
not
be
more
resigned
to
the
judgments
of
its
god
and
is
love
so
constant
so
tenacious
exclaimed
bruce
is
it
to
consume
your
youth
wallace
is
it
to
wed
such
a
heart
as
yours
to
the
tomb
ah
am
i
not
to
hope
that
the
throne
of
my
children
may
be
upheld
by
a
race
of
thine
wallace
shook
his
head
but
with
a
placid
firmness
replied
your
throne
and
your
children
if
they
follow
your
example
will
be
upheld
by
heaven
but
should
they
pervert
themselves
a
host
of
mortal
supports
would
not
be
sufficient
to
stay
their
downfall
in
discourse
like
this
the
youthful
prince
of
scotland
caught
a
clearer
view
of
the
inmost
thoughts
of
his
friend
than
he
had
been
able
to
discern
before
for
war
or
bruce
own
interests
having
particularly
engaged
them
in
all
their
former
conversations
wallace
had
never
been
induced
to
glance
at
the
private
circumstances
of
his
history
while
bruce
sighed
in
tender
pity
for
the
captivated
heart
of
helen
he
the
more
deeply
revered
more
intensely
loved
his
suffering
and
heroic
friend
a
few
hours
brought
the
royal
escort
to
the
louvre
and
through
a
train
of
nobles
helen
was
led
by
prince
louis
into
the
regal
saloon
the
scottish
chiefs
followed
the
queen
and
the
count
received
bruce
and
helen
while
de
valois
conducted
wallace
to
the
king
who
had
retired
for
the
purpose
of
this
conference
to
his
closet
at
sight
of
the
armor
which
he
had
sent
to
the
preserver
of
his
son
philip
instantly
recognized
the
scottish
hero
and
rising
from
his
seat
hastened
forward
and
clasped
him
in
his
arms
wonder
not
august
chief
exclaimed
he
at
the
weakness
exhibited
in
these
eyes
it
is
the
tribute
of
nature
to
a
virtue
which
loads
even
kings
with
benefits
you
have
saved
my
son
life
you
have
preserved
from
taint
the
honor
of
my
sister
philip
then
proceeded
to
inform
his
auditor
that
he
had
heard
from
a
confessor
of
queen
margaret
just
arrived
from
england
all
that
had
lately
happened
at
edward
court
and
of
wallace
letter
to
clear
the
innocence
of
that
injured
princess
she
is
perfectly
reinstated
in
the
king
confidence
added
philip
but
i
can
never
pardon
the
infamy
with
which
he
would
have
overwhelmed
her
nay
it
has
already
dishonored
her
for
the
blasting
effects
of
slander
no
time
nor
labor
can
erase
i
yield
to
the
prayers
of
my
too
gentle
sister
not
to
openly
resent
this
wrong
but
in
private
he
shall
feel
a
brother
indignation
i
do
not
declare
war
against
him
but
ask
what
you
will
bravest
of
men
and
were
it
to
place
the
crown
of
scotland
on
your
head
demand
it
of
me
and
by
my
concealed
agency
it
shall
be
effected
the
reply
of
wallace
was
simple
he
claimed
no
merit
in
the
justice
he
had
done
the
queen
of
england
neither
in
his
rescue
of
prince
louis
but
as
a
proof
of
king
philip
friendship
he
gladly
embraced
his
offered
services
with
regard
to
scotland
not
added
he
to
send
troops
into
that
country
against
england
scotland
is
now
free
of
its
southron
invaders
all
i
require
is
that
you
will
use
your
royal
influence
with
edward
to
allow
it
to
remain
so
pledge
your
faith
most
gracious
monarch
with
my
master
the
royally
descended
bruce
who
is
now
in
your
palace
he
will
soon
assume
the
crown
that
is
his
right
and
with
such
an
ally
as
france
to
hold
the
ambition
of
edward
in
check
we
may
certainly
hope
that
the
bloody
feuds
between
scotland
and
england
may
at
last
be
laid
to
rest
wallace
explained
to
philip
the
dispositions
of
the
scots
the
nature
of
bruce
claims
and
the
transcendent
virtues
of
his
youthful
character
the
monarch
took
fire
at
the
speaker
enthusiasm
and
giving
him
his
hand
exclaimed
wallace
i
know
not
what
manner
of
man
you
are
you
seem
born
to
dictate
to
kings
while
you
put
aside
as
things
of
no
moment
the
crowns
offered
to
yourself
you
are
young
and
marveling
i
would
say
without
ambition
did
i
not
know
that
your
deeds
and
your
virtues
have
set
you
above
all
earthly
titles
but
to
convince
me
that
you
do
not
disdain
the
gratitude
we
pay
at
least
accept
a
name
in
my
country
and
know
that
the
armor
you
wear
the
coronet
around
your
helmet
invest
you
with
the
rank
of
a
prince
of
france
and
the
title
of
count
of
gascony
to
have
refused
this
mark
of
the
monarch
esteem
would
have
been
an
act
of
churlish
pride
foreign
from
the
character
of
wallace
he
graciously
accepted
the
offered
distinction
and
bowing
his
head
allowed
the
king
to
throw
the
brilliant
collar
of
gascony
over
his
neck
this
act
was
performed
by
philip
with
all
the
emotions
of
disinterested
esteem
but
when
he
had
proposed
it
to
his
brother
as
the
only
way
he
could
devise
of
rewarding
wallace
for
the
preservation
of
his
son
and
the
honor
of
their
sister
he
was
obliged
to
urge
in
support
of
his
wish
the
desire
he
had
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
being
revenged
on
edward
by
the
reseizure
of
guienne
to
have
sir
william
wallace
lord
of
gascony
would
then
be
of
the
greatest
advantage
as
no
doubt
could
be
entertained
of
his
arms
soon
restoring
the
sister
province
to
the
french
monarchy
in
such
a
case
philip
promised
to
bestow
guienne
on
his
brother
to
attach
this
new
count
to
france
was
now
all
the
wish
of
philip
and
he
closed
the
conference
with
every
expression
of
friendship
which
man
could
deliver
to
man
wallace
lost
not
the
opportunity
of
pleading
for
the
abdicated
king
of
scots
and
philip
eager
as
well
to
evince
his
resentment
to
edward
as
to
oblige
wallace
promised
to
send
immediate
orders
to
normandy
that
de
valence
should
leave
chateau
galliard
and
baliol
be
attended
with
his
former
state
the
king
then
led
his
guest
into
the
royal
saloon
where
they
found
the
queen
seated
between
bruce
and
helen
at
sight
of
the
scottish
chief
her
majesty
rose
philip
led
him
up
to
her
and
wallace
bending
his
knee
put
the
fair
hand
extended
to
his
lips
welcome
said
she
bravest
of
knights
receive
a
mother
thanks
tears
of
gratitude
stood
in
her
eyes
she
clasped
the
hand
of
her
son
and
his
together
and
added
louis
wherever
our
count
of
gascony
advises
you
to
pledge
this
hand
give
it
then
it
will
follow
mine
cried
the
king
putting
his
into
that
of
bruce
you
are
wallace
acknowledged
sovereign
young
prince
and
you
shall
ever
find
brothers
in
me
and
my
son
sweet
lady
added
he
turning
to
the
glowing
helen
thanks
to
your
charms
for
having
drawn
this
friend
of
mankind
to
bless
our
shores
the
court
knew
wallace
merely
as
count
of
gascony
and
to
preserve
an
equal
concealment
bruce
assumed
the
name
of
the
young
de
longueville
whom
prince
louis
had
in
fact
allowed
to
leave
him
on
the
road
to
paris
to
retire
to
chartres
there
to
pass
a
year
of
mourning
within
its
penitential
monastery
only
two
persons
ever
came
to
the
louvre
who
could
recognize
bruce
to
be
other
than
he
seemed
and
they
were
john
cummin
the
elder
twin
brother
of
the
present
regent
of
scotland
and
james
lord
douglas
the
former
had
remained
in
france
out
of
dislike
to
his
brother
proceedings
and
as
bruce
knew
him
in
guienne
and
believed
him
to
be
a
blunt
young
man
he
saw
no
danger
in
trusting
him
the
brave
son
of
william
douglas
was
altogether
of
a
nobler
mettle
and
both
wallace
and
his
prince
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
receiving
him
to
their
friendship
philip
opened
the
affair
to
the
two
lords
and
having
declared
his
designs
in
favor
of
bruce
conducted
them
into
t
he
queen
room
and
pointing
where
he
stood
there
cried
he
is
the
king
of
scotland
douglas
and
cummin
would
have
bent
their
knees
to
their
young
monarch
but
bruce
hastily
caught
their
hands
and
prevented
them
my
friends
said
he
regard
me
as
your
only
till
you
see
me
on
the
throne
of
my
fathers
till
then
that
is
our
prince
added
he
looking
on
wallace
he
is
my
leader
my
counselor
my
example
and
if
you
love
me
he
must
be
yours
douglas
and
cummin
turned
toward
wallace
at
these
words
royalty
did
indeed
sit
on
his
brow
but
with
a
tempered
majesty
which
spoke
only
in
love
and
honor
from
the
resplendent
countenance
of
bruce
it
smiled
and
threatened
for
the
blaze
of
his
impassioned
nature
was
not
yet
subdued
the
queen
looked
from
one
to
the
other
the
divinely
composed
air
of
wallace
seemed
to
her
the
celestial
port
of
some
being
lent
awhile
to
earth
to
guide
the
steps
of
the
prince
of
scotland
she
had
read
in
homer
song
of
the
deity
of
wisdom
assuming
the
form
of
mentor
to
protect
the
son
of
ulysses
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
youth
of
the
scottish
chief
she
would
have
said
here
is
the
realization
of
the
tale
helen
had
eyes
for
none
but
wallace
nobles
princes
kings
were
all
involved
in
one
uninteresting
mass
to
her
when
he
was
present
yet
she
smiled
on
douglas
when
she
heard
him
express
his
gratitude
to
the
champion
of
scotland
for
the
services
he
had
done
a
country
for
which
his
own
father
had
died
cummin
when
he
paid
his
respects
to
wallace
told
him
that
he
did
so
with
double
pleasure
since
he
had
two
unquestionable
evidences
of
his
unequaled
merit
the
confidence
of
his
father
the
lord
badenoch
and
the
hatred
of
his
brother
the
present
usurper
of
that
title
the
king
soon
after
led
his
guests
to
the
where
a
secret
cabinet
was
to
be
held
to
settle
the
future
bonds
between
the
two
kingdoms
and
helen
looking
long
after
the
departing
figure
of
wallace
with
a
pensive
step
followed
the
queen
to
her
apartment
chapter
lxvi
the
louvre
these
preliminaries
of
lasting
friendship
being
arranged
and
sworn
to
by
philip
wallace
dispatched
a
messenger
to
scotland
to
lord
ruthven
at
huntingtower
informing
him
of
the
present
happy
dispositions
with
regard
to
scotland
he
made
particular
inquiries
respecting
the
state
of
the
public
mind
and
declared
his
intention
not
to
introduce
bruce
amongst
the
cabals
of
his
chieftains
until
he
knew
exactly
how
they
were
all
disposed
some
weeks
passed
before
a
reply
to
this
letter
arrived
during
the
time
the
health
of
helen
which
had
been
much
impaired
by
the
sufferings
inflicted
on
her
by
de
valence
gradually
recovered
and
her
beauty
became
as
much
the
admiration
of
the
french
nobles
as
her
meek
dignity
was
of
their
respect
a
new
scene
of
royalty
presented
itself
in
this
gay
court
to
wallace
for
all
was
pageant
and
chivalric
gallantry
but
it
had
no
other
effect
on
him
than
that
of
exciting
those
benevolent
affections
which
rejoiced
in
the
innocent
gayeties
of
his
his
gravity
was
not
that
of
a
cynic
though
hilarity
never
awakened
his
mind
to
buoyant
mirth
yet
he
loved
to
see
it
in
others
and
smiled
when
others
laughed
with
a
natural
superiority
which
looked
over
these
court
pastimes
to
objects
of
greater
moment
bruce
merely
endured
them
but
it
was
with
an
urbanity
congenial
with
his
friend
and
while
the
princes
of
france
were
treading
the
giddy
mazes
of
the
dance
or
tilting
at
each
other
in
the
mimic
war
of
the
tournament
the
prince
of
scotland
who
excelled
in
all
these
exercises
left
the
field
of
gallantry
undisputed
and
moved
an
uninterested
spectator
in
the
splendid
scene
talking
with
wallace
or
with
helen
on
events
which
yet
lay
in
fate
and
whose
theater
would
be
the
field
of
his
native
land
so
accustomed
had
the
friends
now
been
to
share
their
thoughts
with
lady
helen
that
they
imparted
to
her
their
plans
and
listened
with
pleasure
to
her
timid
yet
judicious
remarks
her
soul
was
inspired
with
the
same
zeal
for
scotland
which
animated
their
own
breasts
like
bruce
it
was
ardent
but
like
wallace
it
was
tempered
with
a
moderation
which
giving
her
foresight
freed
her
opinion
from
the
hazard
of
rashness
what
he
possessed
by
the
suggestions
of
genius
or
had
acquired
by
experience
she
learned
from
love
it
taught
her
to
be
careful
for
the
safety
of
wallace
and
while
she
saw
that
his
life
must
often
be
put
in
peril
for
scotland
her
watchful
spirit
with
an
eagle
ken
perceived
and
gave
warning
where
his
exposure
might
incur
danger
without
adequate
advantage
the
winds
of
this
season
of
the
year
being
violent
and
often
adverse
wallace
messenger
did
not
arrive
at
his
destined
port
in
scotland
till
the
middle
of
november
and
the
january
of
had
commenced
before
his
returning
bark
entered
the
mouth
of
the
seine
wallace
was
alone
with
grimsby
opening
the
door
announced
sir
edwin
ruthven
in
a
moment
the
friends
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
edwin
straining
wallace
to
his
heart
reproached
him
in
affectionate
terms
for
having
left
him
behind
but
while
he
spoke
joy
shone
through
the
tears
which
hung
on
his
eyelids
and
with
the
smiles
of
fraternal
love
again
and
again
he
kissed
his
friend
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
bosom
wallace
answered
his
glad
emotions
with
similar
demonstrations
of
affection
and
when
the
agitations
of
their
meeting
were
subdued
he
learned
from
edwin
that
he
had
left
the
messenger
at
some
distance
on
the
road
so
impatient
was
he
to
embrace
his
friend
again
and
to
congratulate
his
dear
cousin
on
her
escape
edwin
answered
the
anxious
inquiries
of
wallace
respecting
his
country
by
informing
him
that
badenoch
having
arrogated
to
himself
the
supreme
power
in
scotland
had
determined
to
take
every
advantage
of
the
last
victory
gained
over
king
edward
in
this
resolution
he
was
supported
by
the
lords
athol
buchan
and
soulis
who
were
returned
full
of
indignation
from
the
court
of
durham
edward
removed
to
london
and
badenoch
soon
hearing
that
he
was
preparing
other
armies
for
the
subjugation
of
scotland
sent
embassadors
to
the
vatican
to
solicit
the
pope
interference
flattered
by
this
appeal
boniface
wrote
a
letter
to
edward
exhorting
him
to
refrain
from
further
oppressing
a
country
over
which
he
had
no
lawful
power
edward
answer
was
full
of
artifice
and
falsehood
every
good
principle
and
declaring
his
determination
to
consolidate
great
britain
into
one
kingdom
or
to
make
the
northern
part
one
universal
grave
wallace
sighed
as
he
listened
these
curious
letters
are
extant
in
hollingshed
ah
my
dear
edwin
said
he
how
just
is
the
observation
that
the
almost
total
neglect
of
truth
and
justice
which
the
generality
of
statesmen
discover
in
their
transactions
with
each
other
is
an
unaccountable
to
reason
as
it
is
dishonorable
and
ruinous
it
is
one
source
of
the
misery
of
the
human
race
a
misery
in
which
millions
are
involved
without
any
compensation
for
it
seldom
happens
that
this
dishonesty
contributes
ultimately
even
to
the
interests
of
the
princes
who
thus
basely
sacrifice
their
integrity
to
their
ambition
but
proceed
my
friend
the
speedy
consequence
of
this
correspondence
edwin
continued
was
a
renewal
of
hostilities
against
scotland
badenoch
took
sir
simon
fraser
as
his
colleague
in
military
duty
and
a
stout
resistance
for
a
little
while
was
made
on
the
borders
but
berwick
soon
became
the
prey
of
lord
percy
and
the
brave
lord
dundaff
was
killed
defending
the
citadel
many
other
places
fell
and
battles
were
fought
in
which
the
english
were
everywhere
victorious
for
added
edwin
none
of
your
generals
would
draw
a
sword
under
the
command
of
badenoch
and
alarmed
at
these
disasters
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
is
gone
to
rome
to
entreat
the
pope
to
order
your
return
the
southrons
are
advancing
into
scotland
in
every
direction
they
have
landed
again
on
the
eastern
coast
they
have
possessed
themselves
of
all
the
border
counties
and
without
your
arm
to
avert
the
blow
our
country
must
be
irretrievably
lost
edwin
had
brought
letters
from
ruthven
and
the
young
earl
of
bothwell
which
none
particularly
narrated
these
ruinous
events
to
enforce
every
argument
to
wallace
for
his
return
they
gave
it
as
their
opinion
however
that
he
must
revisit
scotland
under
an
assumed
name
did
he
come
openly
the
jealousy
of
the
scottish
lords
would
be
reawakened
and
the
worst
of
them
might
put
a
finishing
stroke
to
their
country
by
taking
him
off
by
assassination
or
poison
ruthven
and
bothwell
therefore
entreated
that
as
it
was
his
wisdom
as
well
as
his
valor
their
country
required
he
would
hasten
to
scotland
and
condescend
to
serve
her
unrecognized
till
bruce
should
be
established
on
the
throne
while
edwin
was
conducted
to
the
apartments
of
lady
helen
wallace
took
these
letters
to
his
prince
on
bruce
being
informed
of
the
circumstances
in
which
his
country
lay
and
of
the
wishes
of
its
most
virtuous
chiefs
for
his
accession
to
the
crown
he
assented
to
the
prudence
of
their
advice
with
regard
to
wallace
but
added
he
our
fortunes
must
be
in
every
respect
as
far
as
we
can
mold
them
the
same
while
you
are
to
serve
scotland
under
a
cloud
so
will
i
at
the
moment
bruce
is
proclaimed
king
of
scotland
wallace
shall
be
declared
its
bravest
friend
we
will
go
together
as
brothers
if
you
will
continued
he
i
am
already
considered
by
the
french
nobility
as
thomas
de
longueville
you
may
personate
the
red
reaver
scotland
does
not
yet
know
that
he
was
slain
and
the
reputation
of
his
valor
and
a
certain
nobleness
in
his
wild
warfare
having
placed
him
in
the
estimation
of
our
shores
rather
in
the
light
of
one
of
their
own
island
than
in
that
of
his
real
character
a
gallant
though
fierce
pirate
the
aid
of
his
name
would
bring
no
evil
odor
to
our
joint
appearance
but
were
you
to
wear
the
title
you
bear
here
a
quarrel
might
ensue
between
philip
and
edward
which
i
perceive
the
former
is
not
willing
should
occur
openly
edward
must
deem
it
a
breach
of
their
amity
did
his
permit
a
french
prince
to
appear
in
arms
against
him
in
scotland
but
the
reaver
being
considered
in
england
as
outlawed
by
france
no
surprise
can
be
excited
that
he
and
his
brother
should
fight
against
philip
ally
we
will
then
assume
their
characters
and
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
serving
for
scotland
before
i
claim
her
as
my
own
when
we
again
drive
edward
over
the
boarders
on
that
day
we
will
throw
off
our
visors
and
sir
william
wallace
shall
place
the
crown
on
my
head
wallace
could
not
but
approve
the
dignity
of
mind
which
these
sentiments
displayed
in
the
same
situation
they
would
have
been
his
own
and
he
sought
not
from
any
motive
of
policy
to
dissuade
bruce
from
a
delicacy
of
conduct
which
drew
him
closer
to
his
heart
sympathy
of
tastes
is
a
pleasant
attraction
but
congeniality
of
principles
is
the
cement
of
souls
this
wallace
felt
in
his
friendship
with
bruce
and
though
his
regard
for
him
had
none
of
that
fostering
tenderness
with
which
he
loved
to
contemplate
the
blooming
virtues
of
the
youthful
edwin
yet
it
breathed
every
endearment
arising
from
a
perfect
equality
in
heart
and
mind
it
was
the
true
fraternal
tie
and
while
he
talked
with
him
on
the
fulfillment
of
their
enterprise
he
inwardly
thanked
heaven
for
blessing
him
so
abundantly
he
had
found
a
son
in
edwin
a
brother
and
a
tender
sister
in
the
noble
bruce
and
lovely
helen
bruce
received
edwin
with
a
welcome
which
convinced
the
before
anxious
youth
that
he
met
a
friend
rather
than
a
rival
in
the
heart
of
wallace
and
every
preliminary
being
settled
by
the
three
friends
respecting
their
immediate
return
to
scotland
they
repaired
to
philip
to
inform
him
of
lord
ruthven
dispatches
and
their
consequent
resolutions
the
king
liked
all
they
said
excepting
their
request
to
be
permitted
to
take
an
early
leave
of
his
court
he
urged
them
to
wait
the
return
of
a
second
embassador
he
had
sent
to
england
immediately
on
wallace
arrival
philip
had
dispatched
a
request
to
the
english
king
that
he
would
grant
the
scots
the
peace
which
was
their
right
not
receiving
any
answer
he
sent
another
messenger
with
a
more
categorical
demand
the
persevered
hostilities
of
edward
against
scotland
explained
the
delay
but
the
king
yet
hoped
for
a
favorable
reply
and
made
such
entreaties
to
bruce
and
his
friend
to
remain
in
paris
till
it
should
arrive
that
they
at
last
granted
a
reluctant
consent
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
embassador
returned
with
a
conciliatory
letter
to
philip
but
affirming
edward
right
to
scotland
declared
his
determination
never
to
lay
down
his
arms
till
he
had
again
brought
the
whole
realm
under
his
scepter
wallace
and
his
royal
friend
now
saw
no
reason
for
lingering
in
france
and
having
visited
the
young
de
longueville
at
chartres
they
apprised
him
of
their
intention
to
still
further
borrow
his
name
we
will
not
disgrace
it
cried
bruce
i
promised
to
return
it
to
you
a
theme
for
your
country
minstrels
when
the
friends
rose
to
depart
the
brave
and
youthful
penitent
grasped
their
hands
you
go
valiant
scots
to
cover
with
a
double
glory
in
the
field
of
honor
a
name
which
my
unhappy
brother
guy
dyed
deep
in
his
own
country
blood
the
tears
i
weep
before
this
cross
for
his
and
my
transgressions
have
obtained
me
mercy
and
your
design
is
an
earnest
to
me
from
him
who
hung
on
this
sacred
tree
that
my
brother
also
is
forgiven
at
an
early
hour
next
day
wallace
and
bruce
took
leave
of
the
french
king
the
queen
kissed
helen
affectionately
and
whispered
while
she
tied
a
jeweled
collar
round
her
neck
that
when
she
returned
she
hoped
to
add
to
it
the
coronet
of
gascony
helen
only
reply
was
a
sigh
and
her
eyes
turned
unconsciously
on
wallace
he
was
clad
in
a
plain
suit
of
black
armor
with
a
red
plume
in
his
helmet
the
ensign
of
the
reaver
whose
name
he
had
assumed
all
of
his
former
habit
that
he
now
wore
about
him
was
the
sword
which
he
had
taken
from
edward
at
the
moment
helen
looked
toward
wallace
prince
louis
was
placing
a
dagger
in
his
girdle
my
deliverer
said
he
wear
this
for
the
sake
of
the
descendant
of
louis
it
accompanied
that
holy
king
through
all
his
wars
in
palestine
it
twice
saved
him
from
the
assassin
steel
and
i
pray
heaven
it
may
prove
as
faithful
to
you
author
was
shown
the
dagger
of
wallace
by
a
friend
it
was
of
very
strong
but
simple
workmanship
and
could
be
used
as
a
knife
as
well
as
a
weapon
soon
after
this
douglas
and
cummin
entered
to
pay
their
parting
respects
to
the
king
and
that
over
wallace
taking
helen
by
the
hand
led
her
forth
followed
by
bruce
and
his
friends
at
havre
they
embarked
for
the
frith
of
tay
and
a
favorable
gate
driving
them
through
the
straits
of
calais
they
launched
out
into
the
wide
ocean
chapter
lxvii
scotland
the
eighth
morning
from
the
day
in
which
the
red
reaver
ship
was
relaunched
from
the
norman
harbor
wallace
now
the
representative
of
that
once
formidable
pirate
bearing
the
white
flag
of
good
faith
entered
between
the
castled
shores
of
the
frith
of
tay
and
cast
anchor
under
the
towers
of
dundee
when
bruce
leaped
upon
the
beach
he
turned
to
wallace
and
said
with
exultation
though
in
a
low
voice
scotland
now
receives
her
king
this
earth
shall
cover
me
or
support
my
throne
it
shall
support
your
throne
and
bless
it
too
replied
wallace
you
are
come
in
the
power
of
justice
and
that
is
the
power
of
god
i
know
him
in
whom
i
bid
you
confide
for
he
has
been
my
shield
and
sword
and
never
yet
have
i
turned
my
back
upon
my
enemies
trust
my
dear
prince
where
i
have
trusted
and
while
virtue
is
your
incense
you
need
not
doubt
the
issue
of
your
prayers
had
wallace
seen
the
face
of
bruce
at
that
moment
but
the
visor
concealed
it
he
would
have
beheld
an
answer
in
his
eloquent
eyes
which
required
not
words
to
explain
he
grasped
the
hand
of
wallace
with
fervor
and
briefly
replied
your
trust
shall
be
my
trust
the
chiefs
did
not
stay
longer
at
dundee
than
was
requisite
to
furnish
them
with
horses
to
convey
them
to
perth
where
ruthven
still
bore
sway
when
they
arrived
he
was
at
huntingtower
and
thither
they
went
the
meeting
was
fraught
with
many
mingled
feelings
helen
had
not
seen
her
uncle
since
the
death
of
her
father
and
as
soon
as
the
first
gratulations
were
over
she
retired
to
an
apartment
to
weep
alone
on
cummin
being
presented
to
lord
ruthven
the
earl
told
him
he
must
now
salute
him
as
lord
badenoch
his
brother
having
been
killed
a
few
days
before
in
a
skirmish
on
the
skirts
of
ettrick
forest
ruthven
then
turned
to
welcome
the
entrance
of
bruce
who
raising
his
visor
received
from
the
loyal
chief
the
homage
due
to
his
sovereign
dignity
wallace
and
the
prince
soon
engaged
him
in
a
discourse
immediately
connected
with
the
design
of
their
return
and
learned
that
scotland
did
indeed
require
the
royal
arm
and
the
counsel
of
its
best
and
lately
almost
banished
friend
much
of
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
was
again
in
possession
of
edward
generals
they
had
seized
on
every
castle
in
the
lowlands
none
having
been
considered
too
insignificant
to
escape
their
hands
nor
could
the
quiet
of
reposing
age
elude
the
general
devastation
and
after
a
dauntless
defense
of
his
castle
the
veteran
knight
of
thirlestane
had
fallen
and
with
him
his
only
son
on
hearing
this
disaster
the
sage
of
ercildown
having
meanwhile
protected
lady
isabella
mar
at
learmont
conveyed
her
northward
but
falling
sick
at
roslyn
he
had
stopped
there
and
the
messenger
he
dispatched
to
huntingtower
with
these
calamitous
tidings
who
happened
to
be
that
brave
young
gordon
whose
borrowed
breastplate
had
been
that
of
bruce
in
his
first
battle
for
scotland
bore
also
information
that
besides
several
parties
of
the
enemy
which
were
hovering
on
the
heights
near
roslyn
an
immense
army
was
approaching
from
northumberland
ercildown
said
he
understood
sir
simon
fraser
was
hastening
forward
with
a
small
body
to
attempt
cutting
off
these
advanced
squadrons
but
he
added
while
the
contentions
continued
between
athol
and
soulis
for
the
vacant
regency
no
man
could
have
hope
of
any
steady
stand
against
england
at
this
communication
cummin
bluntly
proposed
himself
as
the
terminator
of
this
dispute
if
the
regency
were
allowed
to
my
brother
as
head
of
the
house
of
cummin
that
dignity
now
rests
with
me
give
the
word
my
sovereign
said
he
addressing
bruce
and
none
there
shall
dare
oppose
my
rights
ruthven
approved
this
proposal
and
wallace
deeming
it
not
only
the
best
way
of
silencing
the
pretensions
of
those
old
disturbers
of
the
public
tranquility
but
a
happy
opportunity
of
putting
the
chief
magistracy
into
the
hands
of
a
confidant
of
their
design
seconded
the
advice
of
ruthven
thus
john
cummin
lord
badenoch
was
invested
with
the
regency
and
immediately
dispatched
to
the
army
to
assume
it
as
if
in
right
of
his
being
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
in
default
of
the
bruce
wallace
sent
lord
douglas
privately
into
clydesdale
to
inform
earl
bothwell
of
his
arrival
and
to
request
his
instant
presence
with
the
lanark
division
and
his
own
troops
on
the
banks
of
the
eske
ruthven
ascended
the
grampians
to
call
out
the
numerous
clans
of
perthshire
and
wallace
with
his
prince
prepared
themselves
for
meeting
the
auxiliaries
before
the
towers
of
roslyn
meanwhile
as
huntingtower
would
be
an
insecure
asylum
for
helen
when
it
must
be
left
to
domestics
alone
wallace
proposed
to
edwin
that
he
should
escort
his
cousin
to
braemar
and
place
her
under
the
care
of
his
mother
and
the
widowed
countess
thither
continued
he
we
will
send
lady
isabella
also
should
heaven
bless
our
arms
at
roslyn
edwin
acquiesced
as
he
was
to
return
with
all
speed
to
join
his
friend
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
forth
and
helen
aware
that
scenes
of
blood
were
no
scenes
for
her
while
her
heart
was
wrung
to
agony
at
the
thought
of
relinquishing
wallace
to
new
dangers
yielded
a
reluctant
assent
not
merely
to
go
but
to
take
that
look
of
him
which
might
be
the
last
the
sight
of
her
uncle
and
the
objects
around
had
so
recalled
the
image
of
her
father
that
ever
since
her
arrival
a
foreboding
sadness
had
hung
over
her
spirits
she
remembered
that
a
few
months
ago
she
had
seen
that
beloved
parent
go
out
to
battle
whence
he
never
returned
should
the
same
doom
await
her
with
regard
to
wallace
the
idea
shook
her
frame
with
an
agitation
that
sunk
her
in
spite
of
herself
on
the
bosom
of
this
trust
of
friends
when
edwin
approached
to
lead
her
to
her
horse
her
emotions
penetrated
the
heart
against
which
she
leaned
my
gentle
sister
said
wallace
do
not
despair
of
our
final
success
of
the
safety
of
all
whom
you
regard
ah
wallace
faltered
she
in
a
voice
rendered
hardly
audible
by
tears
but
did
i
not
lose
my
father
sweet
helen
returned
he
tenderly
grasping
her
trembling
hand
you
lost
him
but
he
gained
by
the
exchange
and
should
the
peace
of
scotland
be
purchased
by
the
lives
of
your
friends
if
bruce
survives
you
must
still
think
your
prayers
blessed
were
i
to
fall
my
sister
my
sorrows
would
be
over
and
from
the
region
of
universal
blessedness
i
should
enjoy
the
sight
of
scotland
happiness
were
we
all
to
enter
those
regions
at
one
time
faintly
replied
helen
there
would
be
comfort
in
such
thoughts
but
as
it
is
here
she
paused
tears
stopped
her
utterance
a
few
years
is
a
short
separation
returned
wallace
when
we
are
hereafter
to
be
united
to
all
eternity
this
is
my
consolation
when
i
think
of
marion
when
memory
dwells
with
the
friends
lost
in
these
dreadful
conflicts
and
whatever
may
be
the
fate
of
those
who
now
survive
call
to
remembrance
my
words
dear
helen
and
the
god
who
was
my
instructor
will
send
you
comfort
then
farewell
my
friend
my
brother
cried
she
forcibly
tearing
herself
away
and
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of
edwin
leave
me
now
and
the
angel
of
the
just
will
bring
you
in
glory
here
or
hereafter
to
your
sister
helen
wallace
fervently
kissed
the
hand
she
again
extended
to
him
and
with
an
emotion
which
he
had
thought
he
would
never
feel
again
for
mortal
woman
left
the
apartment
chapter
lxviii
roslyn
the
day
after
the
departure
of
helen
bruce
became
impatient
to
take
the
field
and
to
indulge
this
laudable
eagerness
wallace
set
forth
with
him
to
meet
the
returning
steps
of
ruthven
and
his
gathered
legions
having
passed
along
the
borders
of
invermay
the
friends
descended
toward
the
precipitous
banks
of
the
earn
at
the
foot
of
the
grampians
in
these
green
labyrinths
they
wound
their
way
till
bruce
who
had
never
before
been
in
such
mountain
wilds
expressed
a
fear
that
wallace
had
mistaken
the
track
for
this
seemed
far
from
any
human
footstep
wallace
replied
with
a
smile
the
path
is
familiar
to
me
as
the
garden
of
huntingtower
the
day
which
had
been
cloudy
suddenly
turned
to
wind
and
rain
which
certainly
spread
an
air
of
desolation
over
the
scene
very
dreary
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
the
fertile
plains
and
azure
skies
of
the
south
the
whole
of
the
road
was
rough
dangerous
and
dreadful
the
steep
and
black
rocks
towering
above
their
heads
seemed
to
threaten
the
precipitation
of
their
impending
masses
into
the
path
below
but
wallace
had
told
bruce
they
were
in
the
right
track
and
he
gaily
breasted
both
the
storm
and
the
perils
of
the
road
they
ascended
a
mountain
whose
enormous
piles
of
granite
torn
by
many
a
winter
tempest
projected
their
barren
summits
from
a
surface
of
moorland
on
which
lay
a
deep
incrustation
of
snow
the
blast
now
blew
a
tempest
and
the
rain
and
sleet
beat
so
hard
that
bruce
laughing
declared
he
believed
the
witches
of
his
country
were
in
league
with
edward
and
hid
in
shrouds
of
mist
were
all
assembled
here
to
drive
their
lawful
prince
into
the
roaring
cataracts
beneath
thus
enveloped
in
a
sea
of
vapors
with
torrents
of
water
pouring
down
the
sides
of
their
armor
did
the
friends
descend
the
western
brow
of
this
part
of
the
grampians
until
they
approached
loch
earn
they
had
hardly
arrived
there
before
the
rain
ceased
and
the
clouds
rolling
away
from
the
sides
of
the
mountains
discovered
the
vast
and
precipitous
ben
vorlich
its
base
was
covered
with
huge
masses
of
cliffs
scattered
in
fragments
like
the
wreck
of
some
rocky
world
and
spread
abroad
in
wide
and
horrid
desolation
the
mountain
itself
the
highest
in
this
chain
of
the
grampians
was
in
every
part
marked
by
deep
and
black
ravines
made
by
the
rushing
waters
in
the
time
of
floods
but
where
its
blue
head
mingled
with
the
clouds
a
stream
of
brightness
issued
that
seemed
to
promise
the
dispersion
of
its
vapors
and
consequently
a
more
secure
path
for
wallace
to
lead
his
friend
over
its
perilous
heights

of

sir
porter
into
armenia
and
persia
on
her
reperusing
it
now
while
revising
these

reminds
her
strongly
of
his
account
of
the
appearance
of
mount
arafat
as
he
saw
it
under
a
storm
and
which
he
describes
with
so
much
she
must
be
allowed
to
say
sacred
interest
in
his
travels
through
those
this
appearance
did
not
deceive
the
whole
mantle
of
clouds
with
which
the
tops
of
all
the
mountains
had
been
obscured
rolled
away
toward
the
west
and
discovered
to
the
eye
of
wallace
that
this
line
of
light
which
he
had
discerned
through
the
mist
was
the
host
of
ruthven
descending
ben
vorlich
in
defiles
from
the
nature
of
the
path
they
were
obliged
to
move
in
a
winding
direction
and
as
the
sun
now
shone
full
upon
their
arms
and
their
lengthened
lines
gradually
extended
from
the
summit
of
the
mountain
to
its
base
no
sight
could
contain
more
of
the
sublime
none
of
truer
grandeur
to
the
enraptured
mind
of
bruce
he
forgot
his
horror
of
the
wastes
he
had
passed
over
in
the
joy
of
beholding
so
noble
an
army
of
his
countrymen
thus
approaching
to
place
him
upon
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
wallace
cried
he
these
brave
hearts
deserve
a
more
cheerful
home
my
scepter
must
turn
this
scotia
desrta
into
scotia
felix
and
so
shall
i
reward
the
service
they
this
day
bring
me
they
are
happy
in
these
wilds
returned
wallace
their
flocks
browse
the
hills
their
herds
the
valleys
the
soil
yields
sufficient
to
support
its
sons
and
their
luxuries
are
a
minstrel
song
and
the
lip
of
their
brides
their
ambition
is
satisfied
with
following
their
chief
to
the
field
and
their
honor
lies
in
serving
their
god
and
maintaining
the
freedom

beware
then
my
dear
prince
of
changing
the
simple
habits
of
those
virtuous
mountaineers
introduce
the
luxurious
cultivation
of
france
into
these
tracts
you
will
infect
them
with
artificial
wants
and
with
every
want
you
put
a
link
to
a
chain
which
will
fasten
them
to
bondage
whenever
a
tyrant
chooses
to
grasp
it
leave
them
then
their
rocks
as
you
find
them
and
you
will
ever
have
a
hardy
race
ready
to
perish
in
their
defense
or
to
meet
death
for
the
royal
guardian
of
their
liberties
lord
ruthven
no
sooner
reached
the
banks
of
loch
earn
than
he
espied
the
prince
and
wallace
he
joined
them
then
marshaling
his
men
in
a
wide
tract
of
land
at
the
head
of
that
vast
body
of
water
placed
himself
with
the
two
supposed
de
longuevilles
in
the
van
and
in
this
array
marched
through
the
valleys
of
strathmore
and
strathallen
into
stirlingshire
the
young
earl
of
fife
held
the
government
of
the
castle
and
town
of
stirling
and
as
he
had
been
a
zealous
supporter
of
the
rebellious
lord
badenoch
bruce
negatized
ruthven
proposal
to
send
in
a
messenger
for
the
earl
division
of
the
troops
no
my
lord
said
he
like
my
friend
wallace
i
will
have
no
divided
spirits
near
me
all
must
be
earnest
in
my
cause
or
entirely
out
of
the
contest
i
am
content
with
the
brave
men
around
me
after
rapid
marchings
and
short
haltings
they
arrived
safe
at
linlithgow
where
wallace
proposed
staying
a
night
to
refresh
the
troops
who
were
now
joined
by
sir
alexander
ramsay
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
of
his
clan
while
the
men
took
rest
the
chiefs
waked
to
think
for
them
and
wallace
with
bruce
and
ruthven
and
the
brave
ramsay
to
whom
wallace
had
revealed
himself
but
still
kept
bruce
unknown
were
in
deep
consultation
when
grimsby
entered
to
inform
his
master
that
a
young
knight
desired
to
speak
with
sir
guy
de
longueville
his
name
demanded
wallace
he
refused
to
tell
it
replied
grimsby
and
wears
his
beaver
shut
wallace
looked
around
with
a
glance
that
inquired
whether
the
stranger
should
be
admitted
certainly
said
bruce
but
first
put
on
your
mask
wallace
closed
his
visor
and
the
moment
after
grimsby
reentered
with
a
knight
of
elegant
mien
habited
in
a
suit
of
green
armor
linked
with
gold
he
wore
a
close
helmet
from
which
streamed
a
long
feather
of
the
same
hue
wallace
rose
at
his
entrance
the
stranger
advanced
to
him
you
are
he
whom
i
seek
i
am
a
scot
and
a
man
of
few
words
accept
my
services
allow
me
to
attend
you
in
this
war
and
i
will
serve
you
faithfully
wallace
replied
and
who
is
the
brave
knight
to
whom
sir
guy
de
longueville
must
owe
so
great
an
obligation
my
name
answered
the
stranger
shall
not
be
revealed
till
he
who
now
wears
that
of
the
reaver
proclaims
his
own
in
the
day
of
victory
i
know
you
sir
but
your
secret
is
as
safe
with
me
as
in
your
own
breast
place
me
to
fight
by
your
side
and
i
am
yours
forever
wallace
was
surprised
but
not
confounded
by
this
speech
i
have
only
one
question
to
ask
you
noble
stranger
replied
he
before
i
confide
a
cause
dearer
to
me
than
life
in
your
integrity
how
did
you
become
master
of
a
secret
which
i
believed
out
of
the
power
of
treachery
to
betray
no
one
betrayed
your
secret
to
me
i
came
by
my
information
in
an
honorable
manner
but
the
means
i
shall
not
reveal
till
i
see
the
time
to
declare
my
name
and
that
perhaps
may
be
in
the
moment
when
the
assumed
brother
of
yon
young
frenchman
added
the
stranger
turning
to
bruce
and
lowering
his
voice
again
appears
publicly
in
scotland
as
sir
william
wallace
i
am
satisfied
replied
he
well
pleased
that
whoever
this
knight
might
be
bruce
yet
remained
undiscovered
i
grant
your
request
yon
brave
youth
whose
name
i
share
forgives
me
the
success
of
my
sword
i
slew
the
red
reaver
and
therefore
would
restore
a
brother
to
thomas
de
longueville
in
myself
he
fights
on
my
right
hand
you
shall
be
stationed
at
my
left
on
the
side
next
your
heart
exclaimed
the
stranger
let
that
ever
be
my
post
there
to
guard
the
bulwark
of
scotland
the
life
of
the
bravest
of
men
this
enthusiasm
did
not
surprise
any
present
it
was
the
usual
language
of
all
who
approached
sir
william
wallace
and
bruce
particularly
pleased
with
the
heartfelt
energy
with
which
it
was
uttered
forgot
his
disguise
in
the
amiable
fervor
of
approbation
and
half
arose
to
welcome
him
to
his
cause
but
a
look
from
wallace
who
on
being
known
had
uncovered
his
face
arrested
his
intention
and
the
prince
sat
down
again
thankful
for
so
timely
a
check
on
his
precipitancy
in
passing
the
pentland
hills
into
the
chiefs
were
met
by
edwin
who
had
crossed
from
the
north
by
the
frith
of
forth
and
having
heard
no
tidings
of
the
scottish
army
in
the
neighborhood
of
edinburgh
he
had
turned
to
meet
it
on
the
most
probably
road
wallace
introduced
him
to
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
for
that
was
the
appellation
by
which
the
stranger
desired
to
be
known
and
then
made
inquiries
how
lady
helen
had
borne
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
to
braemar
pretty
well
there
replied
he
but
much
better
back
again
he
then
explained
that
on
his
arrival
with
her
neither
lady
mar
nor
his
mother
would
consent
to
remain
so
far
from
the
spot
where
wallace
was
to
contend
again
for
the
safety
of
their
country
helen
did
not
say
anything
in
opposition
to
their
wishes
and
at
last
edwin
yielded
to
the
entreaties
and
tears
of
his
mother
and
aunt
to
bring
them
to
where
they
might
at
least
not
long
endure
the
misery
of
suspense
having
consented
without
an
hour
delay
he
set
forth
with
the
ladies
to
retrace
his
steps
to
huntingtower
and
there
he
left
them
under
a
guard
of
three
hundred
men
whom
he
brought
from
braemar
for
that
purpose
bruce
whose
real
name
had
not
been
revealed
to
the
other
ladies
of
ruthven
family
in
a
lowered
tone
asked
edwin
some
questions
relative
to
the
spirits
in
which
helen
had
parted
with
him
in
losing
her
added
he
my
friend
and
i
feel
but
as
part
of
what
we
were
her
presence
seemed
to
ameliorate
the
fierceness
of
our
and
ever
reminded
me
of
the
angelic
guard
by
whom
heaven
points
our
way
i
left
her
with
looks
like
the
angel
you
speak
of
answered
edwin
but
she
bade
me
farewell
upon
the
platform
of
the
eastern
tower
of
the
castle
when
i
gave
her
the
parting
embrace
she
raised
herself
from
my
breast
and
stretching
her
arms
to
heave
with
her
pure
soul
in
her
eyes
she
exclaimed
him
gracious
god
bless
him
and
his
noble
commander
may
they
ever
with
the
prince
they
love
be
thine
especial
care
i
knelt
by
her
as
she
uttered
this
and
touching
the
hem
of
her
garments
as
some
holy
thing
hurried
from
the
spot
her
prayers
cried
bruce
will
fight
for
us
they
are
arms
well
befitting
the
virgins
of
scotland
to
use
against
its
foes
and
without
such
unction
rejoined
wallace
looking
to
that
heaven
she
had
invoked
the
warrior
may
draw
his
steel
in
vain
on
edwin
introduction
the
stranger
knight
engaged
himself
in
conversation
with
ramsay
but
lord
ruthven
interrupted
the
discourse
by
asking
ramsay
some
questions
relative
to
the
military
positions
on
the
banks
of
the
eske
sir
alexander
being
the
grandson
of
the
lord
of
roslyn
and
having
passed
his
youth
in
its
neighborhood
was
well
qualified
to
answer
these
questions
in
such
discourses
the
scottish
leaders
marched
along
till
passing
before
the
lofty
ridge
of
the
corstophine
hills
they
were
met
by
groups
of
flying
peasantry
at
sight
of
the
scottish
banners
they
stopped
and
informed
their
armed
countrymen
that
the
new
regent
john
of
badenoch
having
rashly
attacked
the
southron
army
in
its
vantage
ground
near
borthwick
castle
had
suffered
defeat
and
was
in
full
and
disordered
retreat
toward
edinburgh
while
the
country
people
fled
on
all
sides
before
the
victors
these
reporters
magnified
the
number
of
the
enemy
to
an
incredible
amount
wallace
was
at
no
loss
in
comprehending
how
much
to
believe
in
this
panic
but
determining
whether
great
or
small
the
power
of
his
adversary
to
intercept
him
at
roslyn
he
sent
to
cummin
and
to
fraser
the
two
commanders
in
the
beaten
and
dispersed
armies
to
rendezvous
on
the
banks
of
the
eske
the
brave
troops
which
he
led
though
ignorant
of
their
real
leader
obeyed
his
direction
under
an
idea
they
were
lord
ruthven
who
was
their
ostensible
general
and
steadily
pursued
their
march
every
village
and
solitary
cot
seemed
recently
deserted
and
through
an
awful
solitude
they
took
their
rapid
way
till
the
towers
of
roslyn
castle
hailed
them
as
a
beacon
from
amidst
the
wooded
heights
of
the
northern
eske
there
cried
ramsay
pointing
to
the
embattled
rock
stands
the
fortress
of
my
forefathers
it
must
this
day
be
made
famous
by
the
actions
performed
before
its
walls
wallace
whose
knowledge
of
this
part
of
the
country
was
not
quite
so
familiar
as
that
of
ramsay
learned
sufficient
from
him
to
decide
at
once
which
would
be
the
most
favourable
position
for
a
small
and
resolute
band
to
assume
against
a
large
and
conquering
army
and
accordingly
disposing
his
troops
which
did
not
amount
to
more
than
eight
thousand
men
he
dispatched
one
thousand
under
the
command
of
ramsay
to
occupy
the
numerous
caves
in
the
southern
banks
of
the
eske
where
they
were
to
issue
in
various
divisions
and
with
shouts
on
the
first
appearance
of
advantage
either
on
his
side
or
on
the
enemy
ruthven
meanwhile
went
for
a
few
minutes
into
the
castle
to
embrace
his
niece
and
to
assure
the
venerable
lord
of
roslyn
that
assistance
approached
his
beleaguered
walls
edwin
who
with
grimsby
had
volunteered
the
dangerous
service
of
reconnoitering
the
enemy
returned
within
an
hour
bringing
in
a
straggler
from
the
english
camp
his
life
was
promised
him
on
condition
of
his
revealing
the
strength
of
the
advancing
army
the
terrified
wretch
did
not
hesitate
and
from
him
they
learned
that
it
was
commanded
by
sir
john
segrave
and
ralph
confrey
who
deeming
the
country
subdued
by
the
two
last
battles
gained
over
the
black
and
red
cummins
were
preparing
for
a
general
plundering
and
to
sweep
the
land
at
once
segrave
had
divided
his
army
into
three
divisions
to
scatter
themselves
over
the
country
and
everywhere
gather
in
the
spoil
to
be
assured
of
this
being
the
truth
while
grimsby
remained
to
guard
the
prisoner
edwin
went
alone
into
the
track
he
was
told
the
southrons
would
take
and
from
a
height
he
discerned
about
ten
thousand
of
them
winding
along
the
valley
with
this
confirmation
of
the
account
he
brought
him
to
the
scottish
lines
and
wallace
who
well
knew
how
to
reap
advantage
from
the
errors
of
his
enemies
being
joined
by
fraser
and
the
discomfited
regent
made
the
concerted
signal
to
ruthven
that
nobleman
immediately
pointed
out
to
his
men
the
waving
colors
of
the
southron
host
as
it
approached
beneath
the
overhanging
woods
of
hawthorndean
he
exhorted
them
by
their
fathers
wives
and
children
to
breast
the
enemy
at
this
spot
to
grapple
with
him
till
he
fell
scotland
cried
he
is
lost
or
won
this
day
you
are
freemen
or
slaves
your
families
are
your
own
or
the
property
of
tyrants
fight
stoutly
and
god
will
yield
you
an
invisible
support
red
cummin
was
an
attributive
appellation
of
john
the
last
regent
before
the
accession
of
bruce
his
father
the
princely
earl
of
badenoch
was
called
the
black
cummin
the
scots
answered
their
general
by
a
shout
and
calling
on
him
to
lead
them
forward
ruthven
placed
himself
with
the
regent
and
fraser
in
the
van
and
led
the
charge
little
expecting
an
assault
from
an
adversary
they
had
so
lately
driven
off
the
field
the
southrons
were
taken
by
surprise
but
they
fought
well
and
resolutely
stood
their
ground
till
wallace
and
bruce
who
commanded
the
flanking
divisions
closed
in
upon
them
with
an
impetuosity
that
drove
confrey
division
into
the
river
then
the
ambuscade
of
ramsay
poured
from
his
caves
the
earth
seemed
teeming
with
mailed
warriors
and
the
southrons
seeing
the
surrounding
heights
and
the
deep
defiles
filled
with
the
same
terrific
appearances
fled
with
precipitation
toward
their
second
division
which
lay
a
few
miles
southward
thither
the
conquering
squadrons
of
the
scots
followed
them
the
fugitives
leaping
the
trenches
of
the
encampment
called
out
to
their
comrades
arm
arm
hell
is
in
league
against
us
segrave
was
soon
at
the
head
of
his
legions
and
a
battle
more
desperate
than
the
first
blazed
over
the
field
the
flying
troops
of
the
slain
confrey
rallying
around
the
standard
of
their
fought
with
the
spirit
of
revenge
and
being
now
a
body
of
nearly
men
against
scots
the
conflict
became
tremendous
in
several
points
the
southrons
gained
so
greatly
the
advantage
that
wallace
and
bruce
threw
themselves
successively
into
those
parts
where
the
enemy
most
prevailed
and
by
exhortations
example
and
prowess
they
a
thousand
times
turned
the
fate
of
the
day
appearing
as
they
shot
from
rank
to
rank
to
be
two
comets
of
fire
sent
before
the
scottish
troops
to
consume
all
who
opposed
them
segrave
was
taken
and
forty
english
knights
besides
the
green
borders
of
the
eske
were
dyed
red
with
southron
blood
and
the
enemy
on
all
sides
were
calling
for
quarter
when
of
a
sudden
the
cry
of
havoc
and
st
george
issued
from
the
adjoining
hill
at
the
same
moment
a
posse
of
country
people
who
for
the
sake
of
plunder
had
stolen
into
the
height
seeing
the
advancing
troops
of
a
third
division
of
the
enemy
like
guilty
cowards
rushed
down
amongst
their
brave
defenders
echoing
the
of
england
and
exclaiming
we
are
lost
a
host
reaching
to
the
horizon
is
upon
us
terror
struck
to
many
a
scottish
heart
the
southrons
who
were
just
about
giving
up
their
arms
leaped
upon
their
feet
the
fight
recommenced
with
redoubled
fury
sir
robert
neville
at
the
head
of
the
new
reinforcement
charged
into
the
center
of
the
scottish
legions
bruce
and
edwin
threw
themselves
into
the
breach
which
this
impetuous
onset
had
made
in
that
part
of
their
line
and
fighting
man
to
man
would
have
taken
neville
had
not
a
follower
of
that
nobleman
wielding
a
ponderous
mace
struck
bruce
so
terrible
a
blow
as
to
fracture
his
helmet
and
cast
him
from
his
horse
to
the
ground
the
fall
of
so
active
a
leader
excited
as
much
dismay
in
the
surrounding
scots
as
it
encouraged
the
reviving
spirits
of
the
enemy
edwin
exerted
himself
to
preserve
his
prince
from
being
trampled
on
and
while
he
fought
for
that
purpose
and
afterward
sent
his
senseless
body
off
the
field
under
charge
of
young
gordon
who
had
been
chosen
by
the
disguised
bruce
as
his
especial
aid
to
roslyn
castle
neville
rescued
segrave
and
his
knights
lord
ruthven
now
contended
with
a
feeble
arm
fatigued
with
the
two
preceding
conflicts
covered
with
wounds
and
perceiving
indeed
a
host
pouring
upon
them
on
all
sides
for
the
whole
of
segrave
original
army
of
men
excepting
those
who
had
fallen
in
the
preceding
engagements
were
now
restored
to
the
assault
the
scots
in
despair
gave
ground
some
threw
away
their
arms
to
fly
the
faster
and
by
thus
exposing
themselves
to
the
swords
of
their
enemies
redoubled
the
confusion
indeed
so
great
was
the
havoc
that
the
day
must
have
ended
in
the
universal
destruction
of
every
scot
on
the
field
had
not
wallace
felt
the
crisis
and
that
as
guy
de
longueville
he
shed
his
blood
in
vain
in
vain
his
terrified
countrymen
saw
him
rush
into
the
thickest
of
the
carnage
in
vain
he
called
to
them
by
all
that
was
sacred
to
man
to
stand
to
the
last
he
was
a
foreigner
and
they
had
no
confidence
in
his
exhortations
death
was
before
them
and
they
turned
to
fly
the
fate
of
his
country
was
hung
on
an
instant
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
shone
full
on
the
rocky
promontory
of
the
hill
which
projected
over
the
field
of
combat
he
took
his
resolution
and
spurring
his
steed
up
the
steep
ascent
stood
on
the
summit
where
he
could
be
seen
by
the
whole
army
then
taking
off
his
helmet
he
waved
it
in
the
air
with
a
shout
and
having
drawn
all
eyes
upon
him
suddenly
exclaimed
scots
you
have
this
day
vanquished
the
southrons
twice
if
you
be
men
remember
and
follow
william
wallace
to
a
third
victory
the
cry
which
issued
from
the
amazed
troops
was
that
of
a
people
who
beheld
the
angel
of
their
deliverance
wallace
was
the
chargeword
of
every
heart
the
hero
courage
seemed
instantaneously
diffused
through
every
breast
and
with
braced
arms
and
determined
spirits
forming
at
once
into
the
phalanx
his
thundering
voice
dictated
the
southrons
again
felt
the
weight
of
the
scottish
steel
and
a
battle
ensued
which
made
the
bright
eske
run
purple
to
the
sea
and
covered
the
pastoral
glades
of
hawthorndean
with
the
bodies
of
its
invaders
sir
john
segrave
and
neville
were
both
taken
and
ere
night
closed
in
upon
the
carnage
wallace
granted
quarter
to
those
who
sued
for
it
and
receiving
their
arms
left
them
to
repose
in
their
before
depopulated
camp
chapter
lxix
roslyn
castle
wallace
having
planted
an
adequate
force
in
charge
of
the
prisoners
went
to
the
two
southron
commanders
to
pay
them
the
courtesy
he
thought
due
to
their
bravery
and
rank
before
he
retired
with
his
victorious
followers
toward
roslyn
castle
he
entered
their
tent
alone
at
sight
of
the
warrior
who
had
given
them
so
signal
a
defeat
the
generals
rose
neville
who
had
received
a
slight
wound
in
one
of
his
arms
stretched
out
the
other
to
wallace
sir
william
wallace
said
he
that
you
were
obliged
to
declare
a
name
so
deservedly
renowned
before
the
troops
i
led
could
be
made
to
relinquish
one
step
of
their
advantage
was
an
acknowledgment
in
their
favor
almost
equivalent
to
a
victory
sir
john
segrave
who
stood
leaning
on
his
sword
with
a
disturbed
countenance
interrupted
him
the
fate
of
this
day
can
not
be
attributed
to
any
earthly
name
or
hand
i
believe
my
sovereign
will
allow
the
zeal
with
which
i
have
served
him
and
yet
thirty
thousand
as
brave
men
as
ever
crossed
the
marshes
have
fallen
before
a
handful
of
scots
three
victories
won
over
edward
troops
in
one
day
are
not
events
of
a
commonplace
nature
god
alone
has
been
our
vanquisher
i
acknowledge
it
cried
wallace
and
that
he
is
on
the
side
of
justice
let
the
return
of
matthias
day
ever
remind
your
countrymen
when
segrave
gave
the
victory
to
the
lord
of
hosts
he
did
it
more
from
jealousy
of
what
might
be
edward
opinion
of
his
conduct
when
compared
with
neville
than
from
any
intention
to
imply
that
the
cause
of
scotland
was
justly
such
are
the
impious
inconsistencies
of
unprincipled
men
he
frowned
at
the
reply
of
wallace
and
turned
gloomily
away
neville
returned
a
respectful
answer
and
their
conqueror
soon
after
left
them
edwin
with
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
who
had
indeed
approved
his
valor
by
many
a
brave
deed
performed
at
his
commander
side
awaited
wallace
return
from
his
prisoners
tent
ruthven
came
up
with
wallace
before
he
joined
them
and
told
him
that
bruce
was
safe
under
the
care
of
the
sage
of
ercildown
and
that
the
regent
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
beginning
of
the
day
was
also
in
roslyn
castle
wallace
then
called
edwin
to
him
giving
him
orders
that
all
of
the
survivors
who
had
suffered
in
these
three
desperate
battles
should
be
collected
from
amongst
the
slain
and
carried
into
the
neighboring
castles
of
hawthorndean
brunston
and
dalkeith
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
were
commanded
to
take
their
refreshment
still
under
arms
these
duties
performed
wallace
turned
with
the
eagerness
of
friendship
and
loyalty
to
see
how
bruce
fared
the
moon
shone
brightly
as
his
party
rode
forward
wallace
ascended
the
steep
acclivity
on
which
roslyn
castle
stands
in
crossing
the
drawbridge
which
divides
its
rocky
peninsula
from
the
main
land
he
looked
around
and
sighed
the
scene
reminded
him
of
ellerslie
a
deep
shadow
lay
on
the
woods
beneath
and
the
pensile
branches
of
the
now
leafless
trees
bending
to
meet
the
flood
seemed
mourning
the
deaths
which
now
polluted
its
stream
the
water
lay
in
profound
repose
at
the
base
of
these
beautiful
craigs
as
if
peace
longed
to
become
an
inhabitant
of
so
lovely
a
scene
at
the
gate
of
the
castle
its
aged
master
the
lord
sinclair
met
wallace
to
bid
him
welcome
blessed
be
the
saint
of
this
day
exclaimed
he
for
thus
bringing
our
best
defender
even
as
by
a
miracle
to
snatch
us
as
a
brand
from
the
fire
my
gates
like
my
heart
open
to
receive
the
true
regent
of
scotland
i
have
only
done
a
scotchman
duty
venerable
sinclair
replied
wallace
and
must
not
arrogate
a
title
which
scotland
has
transferred
to
other
hands
not
scotland
but
rebellion
replied
the
old
chief
it
was
rebellion
against
the
just
gratitude
of
the
nation
that
invested
the
black
cummin
with
the
regency
and
only
some
similar
infatuation
has
bestowed
the
same
title
on
his
brother
what
did
he
not
lose
till
you
scotland
true
champion
have
reappeared
to
rescue
her
again
from
bondage
the
present
lord
badenoch
is
an
honest
and
a
brave
man
replied
wallace
and
as
i
obey
the
power
which
gave
him
his
authority
i
am
ready
by
fidelity
to
him
to
serve
scotland
with
as
vigorous
a
zeal
as
ever
so
noble
sinclair
when
our
rulers
cast
not
trammels
on
our
virtue
we
must
obey
them
as
the
vicegerents
of
heaven
wallace
then
asked
to
be
conducted
to
his
wounded
friend
sir
thomas
de
longueville
for
sinclair
was
ignorant
of
the
real
rank
of
his
guest
eager
to
oblige
him
his
noble
host
immediately
led
the
way
through
a
gallery
and
opening
the
door
of
an
apartment
discovered
to
him
bruce
lying
on
a
couch
and
a
venerable
figure
whose
silver
beard
and
sweeping
robes
announced
him
to
be
the
sage
of
ercildown
was
bathing
the
wounded
chief
temples
with
balsams
a
young
creature
beautiful
as
a
ministering
seraph
also
hung
over
the
prostrate
chief
she
held
a
golden
casket
in
her
hand
out
of
which
the
sage
drew
the
unctions
he
applied
at
the
sound
of
wallace
voice
who
spoke
in
a
suppressed
tone
to
ruthven
while
entering
the
chamber
the
wounded
prince
started
on
his
arm
to
greet
his
friend
but
he
as
instantly
fell
back
wallace
hastened
forward
when
bruce
recovered
from
the
swoon
into
which
the
suddenness
of
his
attempt
to
rise
had
thrown
him
he
felt
a
hand
grasping
his
he
guessed
to
whom
it
belonged
and
gently
pressed
it
smiled
a
moment
afterward
he
opened
his
eyes
and
in
a
low
voice
articulated
from
his
wounded
lips
my
dear
wallace
you
are
victorious
completely
so
my
prince
and
king
returned
he
in
the
same
tone
all
is
now
plain
before
you
speak
but
the
word
and
render
scotland
happy
not
yet
oh
not
yet
whispered
he
my
more
than
brother
allow
bruce
to
be
himself
again
before
he
is
known
in
the
land
of
his
fathers
this
cruel
wound
in
my
head
must
heal
first
and
then
i
may
again
share
your
dangers
and
your
glory
oh
wallace
not
a
southron
must
taint
our
native
lands
when
my
name
is
proclaimed
in
scotland
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
when
the
body
of
bruce
was
discovered
a
few
years
ago
in
the
abbey
of
dunfermline
his
head
retained
all
its
teeth
excepting
two
in
front
evidently
originally
injured
by
a
stroke
of
violence
beside
this
the
evidence
remained
in
the
bone
of
the
chest
of
the
fact
of
its
having
been
cut
open
after
his
death
for
the
heart
to
be
taken
out
according
to
his
dying
command
to
be
sent
to
the
holy
land
wallace
saw
that
his
prince
was
not
in
a
state
to
bear
argument
and
as
all
had
retired
far
from
the
couch
when
he
approached
it
in
gratitude
for
this
propriety
for
it
had
left
him
and
his
friend
free
to
converse
unobserved
he
turned
toward
the
other
inmates
of
the
chamber
the
sage
advanced
to
him
and
recognizing
in
wallace
now
manly
form
the
fine
youth
he
had
seen
with
sir
ronald
crawford
at
the
claiming
of
the
crown
he
saluted
him
with
a
paternal
affection
tempering
the
sublime
feelings
with
which
even
he
approached
the
resistless
champion
of
his
country
and
then
beckoning
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
so
compassionately
hung
over
the
couch
of
bruce
she
drew
near
the
sage
he
took
her
hand
sir
william
wallace
said
he
this
sweet
child
is
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
brave
mar
who
died
in
the
field
of
glory
on
the
carron
her
grandfather
the
stalwart
knight
of
thirlestane
fell
a
few
weeks
ago
defending
his
castle
and
i
am
almost
all
that
is
left
to
her
though
she
has
or
had
a
sister
of
whom
we
can
learn
no
tidings
isabella
for
it
was
she
covered
her
face
to
conceal
her
emotions
dear
lady
said
wallace
these
venerable
heroes
were
both
known
to
and
beloved
by
me
and
now
that
heaven
has
resumed
them
to
itself
as
the
last
act
of
friendship
that
i
perhaps
may
be
fated
to
pay
to
their
offspring
i
shall
convey
you
to
that
sister
whose
matchless
heart
yearns
to
receive
so
dear
a
consolation
to
disengage
isabella
thoughts
from
the
afflicting
remembrances
now
bathing
her
fair
cheeks
with
tears
ercildown
put
a
cup
of
the
mingled
juice
of
herbs
into
her
hand
and
commissioned
her
to
give
it
to
their
invalid
wallace
now
learned
that
his
friend
wound
was
not
only
in
the
head
accompanied
by
a
severe
concussion
but
that
it
must
be
many
days
before
he
could
remove
him
from
his
bed
without
danger
anxious
to
release
him
from
even
the
scarcely
breathed
whispers
of
his
martial
companions
who
stood
at
some
distance
from
his
couch
wallace
immediately
proposed
leaving
him
to
rest
and
beckoning
the
chiefs
they
followed
him
out
of
the
apartment
on
the
following
morning
he
was
aroused
at
daybreak
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
andrew
lord
bothwell
into
his
tent
the
sounds
of
his
voice
made
wallace
start
from
his
pillow
and
extend
his
arms
to
receive
him
murray
my
brave
invaluable
murray
cried
he
thou
art
welcome
once
more
to
the
side
of
thy
brother
in
arms
thee
and
thine
must
ever
be
first
in
my
heart
the
young
lord
bothwell
returned
his
warm
embrace
in
silent
eloquence
but
sitting
down
by
wallace
couch
he
grasped
his
hand
and
pressing
it
to
his
breast
said
i
feel
a
happiness
here
which
i
have
never
known
since
the
day
of
falkirk
you
quitted
us
wallace
and
all
good
seemed
gone
with
you
or
buried
in
my
father
grave
but
you
return
you
bring
conquest
and
peace
with
you
you
restore
our
helen
to
her
family
you
bless
us
with
yourself
and
shall
you
not
see
again
the
gay
andrew
murray
it
must
be
so
my
friend
melancholy
is
not
my
climate
and
i
shall
now
live
in
your
beams
dear
murray
returned
wallace
this
generous
enthusiasm
can
only
be
equaled
by
my
joy
in
all
that
makes
you
and
scotland
happy
he
then
proceeded
to
confide
to
him
all
that
related
to
bruce
and
to
describe
the
minutiae
of
those
plans
for
his
establishment
which
had
only
been
hinted
in
his
letters
from
france
bothwell
entered
with
ardor
into
these
designs
and
regretted
that
the
difficulty
he
found
in
persuading
the
veterans
of
lanark
to
follow
him
to
any
field
where
they
did
not
expect
to
find
their
beloved
wallace
had
deprived
him
of
the
participation
of
the
late
danger
and
new
glory
of
his
friend
to
compensate
for
that
privation
replied
wallace
while
our
prince
is
disabled
from
pursuing
victory
in
his
own
person
we
must
not
allow
our
present
advantages
to
lose
their
expected
effects
you
shall
accompany
me
through
the
lowlands
where
we
must
recover
the
places
which
the
of
james
cummin
has
lost
murray
gladly
embraced
this
opportunity
of
again
sharing
the
field
with
wallace
and
the
chiefs
joined
bruce
bothwell
was
presented
to
his
young
sovereign
and
douglas
entering
the
discourse
turned
on
their
different
posts
of
duty
wallace
suggested
to
his
royal
friend
that
as
his
restoration
to
health
could
not
be
so
speedy
as
the
cause
required
it
would
be
necessary
not
to
await
that
event
but
begin
the
recovery
of
the
border
counties
before
edward
could
reinforce
their
garrisons
bruce
sighed
but
with
a
generous
glow
suffusing
his
pale
face
said
go
my
friend
bless
scotland
which
way
you
will
and
let
my
ready
acquiescence
convince
future
ages
that
i
love
my
country
beyond
my
own
fame
for
her
sake
i
relinquish
to
you
the
whole
glory
of
delivering
her
out
of
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
who
has
so
long
usurped
my
rights
men
may
say
when
they
hear
this
that
i
do
not
merit
the
crown
you
will
put
upon
my
head
that
i
have
lain
on
a
couch
while
you
fought
for
me
but
i
will
bear
all
obloquy
rather
than
deserve
its
slightest
charge
by
withholding
you
an
hour
from
the
great
work
of
scotland
peace
it
is
not
for
the
breath
of
men
my
dear
prince
returned
wallace
that
either
you
or
i
act
it
is
sufficient
for
us
that
we
effect
their
good
and
whether
the
agent
be
one
or
the
other
the
end
is
the
same
our
deeds
and
intentions
have
one
great
judge
and
he
will
award
the
only
true
glory
such
were
the
principles
which
filled
the
hearts
of
these
two
friends
worthy
of
each
other
and
alike
honorable
to
the
country
that
gave
them
birth
gordon
had
won
their
confidence
and
watched
by
his
pillow
though
the
wounded
john
cummin
remained
possessed
of
the
title
of
regent
wallace
was
virtually
endowed
with
the
authority
whatever
he
suggested
was
acted
upon
as
by
a
decree
all
eyes
looked
to
him
as
to
the
cynosure
by
which
every
order
of
men
in
scotland
were
to
shape
their
course
the
jealousies
which
had
driven
him
from
his
former
supreme
seat
seemed
to
have
died
with
their
prime
instigator
the
late
regent
and
no
chief
of
any
consequence
excepting
soulis
and
athol
who
had
retired
in
disgust
to
their
castles
breathed
a
word
of
opposition
to
the
general
gratitude
wallace
having
dictated
his
terms
and
sent
his
prisoners
to
england
commenced
the
march
that
was
to
clear
the
lowlands
of
the
foe
his
own
valiant
band
headed
by
scrymgeour
and
lockhart
of
lee
rushed
toward
his
standard
with
a
zeal
that
rendered
each
individual
a
host
in
himself
the
fame
of
his
new
victories
seconded
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
and
the
determination
of
the
troops
soon
made
him
master
of
all
the
lately
lost
fortresses
crusading
ancestor
of
this
lockhart
was
the
bringer
of
the
famous
lee
penny
from
the
holy
land
and
from
his
sprung

three
brave
branches
of
the

hardly
four
weeks
were
consumed
in
these
conquests
and
not
a
rood
of
land
remained
south
of
the
tay
in
the
possession
of
england
excepting
berwick
before
that
stronghold
wallace
drew
up
his
forces
to
commence
a
regular
siege
the
governor
intimidated
by
the
powerful
works
which
he
saw
the
scottish
chief
forming
against
the
town
dispatched
a
messenger
to
edward
with
the
tidings
not
only
praying
for
succors
but
to
inform
him
that
if
he
continued
to
refuse
the
peace
for
which
the
scots
fought
he
would
find
it
necessary
to
begin
the
conquest
of

chapter

berwick
while
wallace
accompanied
by
his
brave
friends
was
thus
carrying
all
before
him
from
the
grampian
to
the
cheviot
hills
bruce
was
rapidly
recovering
his
eager
wishes
seemed
to
heal
his
wounds
and
on
the
tenth
day
after
the
departure
of
wallace
he
left
the
couch
which
had
been
beguiled
of
its
irksomeness
by
the
smiling
attentions
of
the
tender
isabella
the
ensuing
sabbath
beheld
him
still
more
restored
and
having
imparted
his
intentions
to
the
lords
ruthven
and
douglas
who
were
both
with
him
the
next
morning
he
joyfully
buckled
on
his
armor
isabella
when
she
saw
him
thus
clad
started
and
the
roses
left
her
cheek
i
am
armed
to
be
your
guide
to
huntingtower
said
he
with
a
look
that
showed
her
he
read
her
thoughts
he
then
called
for
pen
and
ink
to
write
to
wallace
the
reassured
isabella
rejoicing
in
the
glad
beams
of
his
brightening
eyes
held
the
standish
as
he
dipped
his
pen
he
looked
at
her
with
a
grateful
tenderness
that
thrilled
her
soul
and
made
her
bend
her
blushing
face
to
hide
emotions
which
whispered
bliss
in
every
beat
of
her
happy
heart
thus
with
a
spirit
wrapped
in
felicity
for
victory
hailed
him
from
without
and
love
seemed
to
woo
him
to
the
dearest
transports
within
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
wallace
i
am
now
well
my
best
friend
this
day
i
attend
my
lovely
nurse
with
her
venerable
guardian
to
huntingtower
eastward
of
perth
almost
every
castle
of
consequence
is
yet
filled
by
the
southrons
whom
the
folly
of
james
cummin
allowed
to
reoccupy
the
places
whence
you
had
so
lately
driven
them
i
go
to
root
them
out
to
emulate
in
the
north
what
you
are
now
doing
in
the
south
you
shall
see
me
again
when
the
banks
of
the
spey
are
as
free
as
you
have
made
the
forth
in
all
this
i
am
yet
thomas
de
longueville
isabella
the
sweet
soother
of
my
hours
knows
me
as
no
other
for
would
she
not
despise
the
unfamed
bruce
to
deserve
and
win
her
love
as
de
longueville
and
to
marry
her
as
king
of
scotland
is
the
fond
hope
of
your
friend
and
brother
robert
god
speed
me
and
i
shall
send
you
dispatches
of
my
proceedings
wallace
had
just
made
a
successful
attack
upon
the
outworks
of
berwick
when
this
letter
was
put
into
his
hand
he
was
surrounded
by
his
chieftains
and
having
read
it
he
informed
them
that
sir
thomas
de
longueville
was
going
to
the
spey
to
rid
its
castles
of
the
enemy
the
hopes
of
his
enterprising
spirit
continued
wallace
are
so
seconded
by
his
determination
i
doubt
not
that
what
he
promises
god
and
the
justice
of
our
cause
will
perform
and
we
may
soon
expect
to
hear
scotland
has
no
enemies
in
her
highlands
but
in
this
hope
wallace
was
disappointed
day
after
day
passed
and
no
tidings
from
the
north
he
became
anxious
bothwell
and
edwin
too
began
to
share
his
uneasiness
continued
successes
against
berwick
had
assured
them
a
speedy
surrender
when
unexpected
succors
being
thrown
in
by
sea
the
confidence
of
the
garrison
became
and
the
ramparts
appeared
doubly
manned
wallace
saw
that
the
only
alternative
was
to
surprise
and
take
possession
of
the
ships
and
turn
the
siege
into
a
blockade
still
trusting
that
bruce
would
be
prosperous
in
the
highlands
he
calculated
on
full
leisure
to
await
the
fall
of
berwick
on
this
plan
and
so
much
blood
might
be
spared
intent
and
execution
were
in
the
breast
of
wallace
by
a
masterly
stroke
he
effected
his
design
on
the
shipping
and
having
closed
the
southrons
within
their
walls
he
dispatched
lord
bothwell
to
huntingtower
to
learn
the
state
of
military
operations
there
and
above
all
to
bring
back
tidings
of
the
prince
health
on
the
evening
of
the
very
day
in
which
murray
left
berwick
a
desperate
sully
was
made
by
the
garrison
but
they
were
beaten
back
with
such
effect
that
wallace
gained
possession
of
one
of
their
most
commanding
towers
the
contest
did
not
end
till
night
and
after
passing
a
brief
while
in
the
listening
to
the
suggestions
of
his
friends
relative
to
the
use
that
might
be
made
of
the
new
acquisition
he
retired
to
his
own
quarters
at
a
late
hour
at
these
momentous
periods
he
never
seemed
to
need
sleep
and
sitting
at
his
table
setting
the
dispositions
for
the
succeeding
day
he
marked
not
the
time
till
the
flame
of
his
exhausted
lamp
expired
in
the
socket
he
replenished
it
and
had
again
resumed
his
military
labors
when
the
curtain
which
covered
the
door
of
his
tent
was
drawn
aside
and
an
armed
man
entered
wallace
looked
up
and
seeing
that
it
was
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
asked
if
anything
had
occurred
from
the
town
nothing
replied
the
knight
in
an
agitated
voice
and
seating
himself
beside
wallace
any
evil
tidings
from
perthshire
demanded
wallace
who
now
hardly
doubted
that
ill
news
had
arrived
of
bruce
none
was
the
knight
reply
but
i
am
come
to
fulfill
my
promise
to
you
to
unite
myself
forever
heart
and
soul
to
your
destiny
or
you
behold
me
this
night
for
the
last
time
surprised
at
this
address
and
the
emotion
which
shook
the
frame
of
the
unknown
warrior
wallace
answered
him
with
expressions
of
esteem
and
added
if
it
depend
on
me
to
unite
so
brave
a
man
to
my
friendship
forever
only
speak
the
word
declare
your
name
and
i
am
ready
to
seal
the
compact
my
name
declared
the
knight
will
indeed
put
these
protestations
to
the
proof
i
have
fought
by
your
side
sir
william
wallace
i
would
have
died
at
any
moment
to
have
spared
that
breast
a
wound
and
yet
i
dread
to
raise
my
visor
to
show
you
who
i
am
a
look
will
make
me
live
or
blast
me
your
language
confounds
me
noble
knight
replied
wallace
i
know
of
no
man
living
save
the
base
violators
of
lady
helen
mar
liberty
who
need
tremble
before
my
eyes
it
is
not
possible
that
either
of
these
men
is
before
me
and
whoever
you
are
whatever
you
may
have
been
brave
chief
your
deeds
have
proved
you
worthy
of
a
friendship
and
i
pledge
you
mine
the
knight
was
silent
he
took
wallace
hand
he
grasped
it
the
arms
that
held
it
did
indeed
tremble
wallace
again
spoke
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
have
a
power
to
benefit
but
none
to
injure
to
benefit
and
to
injure
cried
the
knight
in
a
transport
of
emotion
you
have
my
life
in
your
hands
oh
grant
it
as
you
value
your
own
happiness
and
honor
look
on
me
and
say
whether
i
am
to
live
or
die
as
the
warrior
spoke
he
cast
himself
impetuously
on
his
knees
and
threw
open
his
visor
wallace
saw
a
fine
but
flushed
face
it
was
much
overshadowed
by
the
helmet
my
friend
said
he
attempting
to
raise
him
by
the
hand
which
clasped
his
your
words
are
mysteries
to
me
and
so
little
right
can
i
have
to
the
power
you
ascribe
to
me
that
although
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
seen
your
features
before
yet
you
forget
me
cried
the
knight
starting
on
his
feet
and
throwing
off
his
helmet
to
the
ground
again
look
on
this
face
and
stab
me
at
once
by
a
second
declaration
that
i
am
remembered
no
more
the
countenance
of
wallace
now
showed
that
he
too
well
remembered
it
he
was
pale
and
aghast
lady
mar
cried
he
not
expecting
to
see
you
under
a
casque
you
will
pardon
me
that
when
so
appareled
i
should
not
immediately
recognize
the
widow
of
my
friend
she
gasped
for
articulation
and
it
is
thus
cried
she
you
answer
the
sacrifices
i
have
made
for
you
for
you
i
have
committed
an
outrage
on
my
nature
i
have
put
on
me
this
abhorrent
steel
i
have
braved
the
dangers
of
many
a
day
and
all
to
guard
your
life
to
convince
you
of
a
love
unexampled
in
woman
and
thus
you
recognize
her
who
has
risked
honor
and
life
for
you
with
coldness
and
reproach
with
neither
lady
mar
returned
he
i
am
grateful
for
the
generous
motives
of
your
conduct
but
for
the
sake
of
the
fair
fame
you
confess
you
have
endangered
in
respect
to
the
memory
of
him
whose
name
you
bear
i
can
not
but
wish
that
so
hazardous
an
instance
of
interest
in
me
had
been
left
undone
if
that
is
all
returned
she
drawing
toward
him
it
is
in
your
power
to
ward
from
me
every
stigma
who
will
dare
to
cast
one
reflection
on
my
fair
fame
when
you
bear
testimony
to
my
purity
who
will
asperse
the
name
of
mar
when
you
displace
it
with
that
of
wallace
make
me
yours
dearest
of
men
cried
she
clasping
his
hands
and
you
will
receive
one
to
your
heart
who
never
knew
how
to
love
before
who
will
be
to
you
what
your
heart
who
never
knew
how
to
love
before
who
will
be
to
you
what
woman
never
yet
was
and
who
will
endow
you
with
territories
nearly
equal
to
those
of
the
king
of
scotland
my
father
is
no
more
and
now
as
countess
of
strathearn
and
princess
of
the
orkneys
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
earn
and
princess
of
the
orkneys
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
bring
a
sovereignty
to
your
head
and
the
fondest
of
wives
to
your
bosom
as
she
vehemently
spoke
and
clung
to
wallace
as
if
she
had
already
a
right
to
seek
comfort
within
his
arms
her
tears
and
violent
agitations
so
disconcerted
him
that
for
a
few
moments
he
could
not
find
a
reply
this
short
endurance
of
her
passion
aroused
her
almost
drooping
hopes
and
intoxicated
with
so
rapturous
an
illusion
she
threw
off
the
little
restraint
in
which
the
awe
of
wallace
coldness
had
confined
her
and
flinging
herself
on
his
breast
poured
forth
all
her
love
and
fond
ambitions
for
him
in
vain
he
attempted
to
interrupt
her
to
raise
her
with
gentleness
from
her
indecorous
situation
she
had
no
perception
but
the
idea
which
had
now
taken
possession
of
her
heart
and
whispering
to
him
softly
said
be
but
my
husband
wallace
and
all
rights
shall
perish
before
my
love
and
your
aggrandizement
in
these
arms
you
shall
bless
the
day
you
first
saw
joanna
of
strathearn
the
prowess
of
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
the
respect
he
owed
to
the
widow
of
the
earl
of
mar
the
tenderness
he
ever
felt
for
all
of
womankind
were
all
forgotten
in
the
disgusting
blandishments
of
this
disgrace
to
her
sex
she
wooed
to
be
his
wife
but
not
with
the
chaste
appeal
of
the
widow
of
mahlon
let
me
find
favor
in
thy
sight
for
thou
hast
comforted
me
spread
thy
garment
over
me
and
let
me
be
thy
wife
said
the
fair
moabitess
who
in
a
strange
land
cast
herself
at
the
feet
of
her
deceased
husband
friend
she
was
answered
i
will
do
all
that
thou
requirest
for
thou
art
a
virtuous
woman
but
neither
the
actions
nor
the
words
of
lady
mar
bore
witness
that
she
deserved
this
appellation
the
were
the
dictates
of
a
passion
impure
as
it
was
intemperate
blinded
by
its
fumes
she
forgot
the
nature
of
the
heart
she
sought
to
pervert
to
sympathy
with
hers
she
saw
not
that
every
look
and
movement
on
her
part
filled
wallace
with
aversion
and
not
until
he
forcibly
broke
from
her
did
she
doubt
the
success
of
her
fond
caresses
lady
mar
said
he
i
must
repeat
that
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
the
proofs
of
regard
you
have
bestowed
on
me
but
such
excess
of
attachment
is
lavished
upon
a
man
that
is
a
bankrupt
in
love
i
am
cold
as
monumental
marble
to
every
touch
of
that
passion
to
which
i
was
once
but
too
entirely
devoted
bereaved
of
the
object
i
am
punished
thus
is
my
heart
doomed
to
solitude
on
earth
for
having
made
an
idol
of
the
angel
that
was
sent
to
cheer
my
path
to
heaven
wallace
said
even
more
than
this
he
remonstrated
with
her
on
the
shipwreck
she
was
making
of
her
own
happiness
in
adhering
thus
tenaciously
to
a
man
who
could
only
regard
her
with
the
general
sentiment
of
esteem
he
urged
her
beauty
and
yet
youthful
years
and
how
many
would
be
eager
to
win
her
love
and
to
marry
her
with
honor
while
he
continued
to
speak
to
her
with
the
tender
consideration
of
a
brother
she
who
knew
no
gradations
in
the
affections
of
the
heart
doubted
his
words
and
believed
that
a
latent
fire
glowed
in
his
breast
which
her
art
might
yet
blow
into
a
flame
she
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
she
wept
she
implored
his
pity
she
wound
her
arms
around
his
and
bathed
his
hands
with
her
tears
but
still
he
continued
to
urge
her
by
every
argument
of
female
delicacy
to
relinquish
her
love
to
return
to
her
domains
before
her
absence
could
be
generally
known
she
looked
up
to
read
his
countenance
a
friend
anxiety
nay
authority
was
there
but
no
glow
of
passion
all
was
calm
and
determined
her
beauty
then
had
been
shown
to
a
man
without
eyes
her
tender
eloquence
poured
on
an
ear
that
was
deaf
her
blandishments
lavished
on
a
block
of
marble
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
she
dashed
the
hand
she
held
far
from
her
and
standing
proudly
on
her
feet
hear
me
thou
man
of
stone
cried
she
and
answer
me
on
your
life
and
honor
for
both
depend
on
your
reply
is
joanna
of
strathearn
to
be
your
wife
cease
to
urge
me
unhappy
lady
returned
wallace
you
already
know
the
decision
of
this
heart
lady
mar
looked
steadfastly
at
him
then
receive
my
last
determination
and
drawing
near
him
with
a
desperate
and
portentous
countenance
as
if
she
meant
to
whisper
in
his
ear
she
suddenly
plucked
louis
dagger
from
his
girdle
and
struck
it
into
his
breast
he
caught
the
hand
which
grasped
the
hilt
her
eyes
glared
with
the
fury
of
a
maniac
and
with
a
horrid
laugh
she
exclaimed
i
have
slain
thee
insolent
triumpher
in
my
love
and
agonies
thou
shalt
not
now
deride
me
in
the
arms
of
thy
minion
for
i
know
that
it
is
not
for
the
dead
marion
you
have
trampled
on
my
heart
but
for
the
living
helen
as
she
spoke
he
moved
her
hold
from
the
dagger
and
drew
the
weapon
from
the
wound
a
torrent
of
blood
flowed
over
his
vest
and
stained
the
hand
that
grasped
hers
she
turned
of
a
deadly
paleness
but
a
demoniac
joy
still
gleamed
in
her
eyes
lady
mar
cried
he
while
he
thrust
the
thickness
of
his
scarf
into
the
wound
i
pardon
this
outrage
go
in
peace
i
shall
never
breathe
to
man
nor
woman
the
occurrences
of
this
night
only
remember
that
with
regard
to
lady
helen
my
wishes
are
as
pure
as
her
own
innocence
so
they
may
be
now
vainly
boasting
immaculate

she
with
bitter
derision

are
saints
when
their
passions
are
satisfied
think
not
to
impose
on
her
who
knows
how
this
vestal
helen
followed
you
in
page
attire
and
without
one
stigma
being
cast
upon
her
maiden
delicacy
i
am
not
to
learn
the
days
and
nights
she
passed
alone
with
you
in
the
woods
of
normandy
did
you
not
follow
her
to
france
did
you
not
tear
her
from
the
arms
of
lord
aymer
de
valence
and
now
relinquishing
her
yourself
you
leave
a
dishonored
bride
to
cheat
the
vows
of
some
honester
man
wallace
i
know
you
and
as
i
have
been
fool
enough
to
love
you
beyond
all
woman
love
i
swear
by
the
powers
of
heaven
and
hell
to
make
you
feel
the
weight
of
hatred
her
denunciation
had
no
effect
on
wallace
but
her
slander
against
her
unoffending
agitated
him
with
an
indignation
that
almost
dispossessed
him
of
himself
in
hurried
and
vehement
words
he
denied
all
that
she
had
alleged
against
helen
and
appealed
to
the
whole
court
of
france
to
witness
her
spotless
innocence
lady
mar
exulted
in
this
emotion
though
every
sentence
by
the
interest
it
displayed
in
its
object
seemed
to
establish
the
truth
of
a
suspicion
which
she
at
first
only
uttered
from
the
vague
workings
of
her
revenge
triumphing
in
the
belief
that
he
had
found
another
as
frail
as
herself
and
yet
maddened
that
another
should
have
been
preferred
before
her
her
jealous
pride
blazed
into
redoubled
flame
swear
cried
she
till
i
see
the
blood
of
that
false
heart
forced
to
my
feet
and
still
i
shall
believe
the
base
daughter
of
mar
a
wanton
i
go
not
to
proclaim
her
dishonor
to
the
world
but
to
deprive
her
of
her
lover
to
yield
the
rebel
wallace
into
the
hands
of
justice
when
on
the
scaffold
proud
exulter
in
those
by
me
now
detested
beauties
remember
that
it
was
joanna
strathearn
who
laid
thy
matchless
head
upon
the
block
who
consigned
those
limbs
of
heaven
own
statuary
to
decorate
the
spires
of
scotland
remember
that
my
curse
pursues
you
here
and
hereafter
a
livid
fire
seemed
to
dart
from
her
scornful
eyes
her
countenance
was
torn
as
by
some
internal
fiend
and
with
the
last
malediction
thundering
from
her
tongue
she
darted
from
his
sight
chapter
lxxi
the
camp
next
morning
wallace
was
recalled
from
the
confusion
into
which
his
nocturnal
visitor
had
thrown
his
mind
by
the
entrance
of
ker
who
came
as
usual
with
the
reports
of
the
night
in
the
course
of
the
communication
he
mentioned
that
about
three
hours
before
sunrise
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
had
left
the
camp
with
his
dispatches
for
sterling
wallace
was
scarcely
surprised
at
this
ready
falsehood
of
lady
mar
and
not
intending
to
betray
her
he
merely
said
long
ere
be
appears
again
i
hope
we
shall
have
good
tidings
from
our
friend
in
the
north
but
day
succeeded
day
and
notwithstanding
bothweil
embassy
no
accounts
arrived
the
countess
had
left
an
emissary
in
the
scottish
camp
who
did
as
she
had
done
before
intercepted
all
messengers
from
perthshire
indeed
from
the
first
of
her
flight
to
wallace
to
the
hour
of
her
qoitting
him
she
had
never
halted
in
her
purpose
from
any
regard
to
honor
previous
to
her
stealing
from
huntingtower
she
had
bribed
the
senesehal
to
say
that
on
the
morning
of
her
disappearance
he
had
met
a
knight
near
saint
concal
well
coming
to
the
castle
who
told
him
that
the
countess
of
mar
was
gone
on
a
secret
mission
to
norway
and
she
therefore
had
commanded
him
by
that
knight
to
enjoin
her
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
most
dear
to
them
all
not
to
acquaint
lord
ruthven
or
any
of
their
friends
with
her
departure
till
she
should
return
with
happy
news
for
scotland
the
man
added
that
after
declaring
this
the
knight
rode
hastily
away
but
this
precaution
which
did
indeed
impose
on
the
innocent
credulty
of
her
husband
sister
and
his
daughter
failed
to
satisfy
the
countess
herself
fearful
that
helen
might
communicate
her
flight
to
wallace
and
so
excite
his
suspicion
of
her
not
being
far
from
him
from
the
moment
of
her
joining
him
at
linlithgow
she
intercepted
every
letter
from
huntingtower
and
when
bruce
went
to
that
castle
she
continued
the
practice
with
double
vigilance
being
jealous
of
what
might
be
said
of
helen
by
this
sir
thomas
de
longueville
in
whom
the
master
of
her
fate
seemed
so
unreservedly
to
confide
to
this
end
even
after
she
left
the
camp
all
packets
from
perthshire
were
conveyed
to
her
by
the
spy
she
had
stationed
near
wallace
while
all
which
were
sent
from
him
to
huntingtower
were
stopped
by
the
treacherous
seneschal
and
thrown
into
the
flames
no
letters
however
ever
came
from
helen
a
few
bore
lord
ruthven
superscription
and
all
the
rest
were
addressed
by
sir
thomas
de
longueville
to
wallace
she
broke
the
seals
of
this
correspondence
but
she
looked
in
vain
on
their
contents
bruce
and
his
friend
as
well
as
ruthven
wrote
in
a
cipher
and
only
one
passage
which
the
former
had
by
chance
written
in
the
common
character
could
she
ever
make
out
it
ran
thus
i
have
just
returned
to
huntingtower
after
the
capture
of
kinfouns
lady
helen
sits
by
me
on
one
side
isabella
on
the
other
isabella
smiles
on
me
like
the
spirit
of
happiness
helen
look
is
not
less
gracious
for
i
tell
her
i
am
writing
to
sir
william
wallace
she
smiles
hut
it
is
with
such
a
smile
as
that
with
which
a
saint
would
relinquish
to
heaven
the
dearest
object
of
its
love
said
i
shall
i
say
from
you
to
our
friend
i
pray
for
him
you
think
of
him
i
pray
for
him
repeated
she
more
emphatically
is
the
way
i
always
think
of
my
preserver
her
manner
checked
me
my
dear
wallace
but
i
would
give
worlds
that
you
could
bring
your
heart
to
make
this
sweet
vestal
smile
as
i
do
her
sister
lady
mar
crushed
the
registered
wish
in
her
hand
and
though
she
was
never
able
to
decipher
a
word
or
more
of
bruce
numerous
letters
many
of
which
could
she
have
read
them
contained
complaints
of
that
silence
she
had
so
cruelly
occasioned
she
took
and
destroyed
them
all
she
had
ever
shunned
the
penetrating
eyes
of
young
lord
bothwell
and
to
have
him
on
the
spot
when
she
should
discover
herself
to
wallace
she
thought
would
only
invite
discomfiture
affecting
to
share
the
general
anxiety
respecting
the
failure
of
communications
from
the
north
she
it
was
who
suggested
the
propriety
of
sending
some
one
of
peculiar
trust
to
make
inquiries
by
covert
insinuations
she
easily
induced
ker
to
propose
bothwell
to
wallace
and
on
the
very
night
that
her
machinations
had
prevailed
to
dispatch
him
on
this
embassy
impatient
yet
doubting
and
agitated
she
went
to
declare
herself
to
the
man
for
whom
she
had
thus
sunk
herself
in
shame
and
falsehood
though
wallace
heard
the
denunciation
with
which
she
left
his
presence
yet
he
did
not
conceive
it
was
more
than
the
evanescent
rage
of
disappointed
passion
and
anticipating
persecutions
rather
from
her
love
than
her
revenge
he
was
relieved
and
not
alarmed
by
the
intelligence
that
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
had
really
taken
his
departure
more
delicate
of
lady
mar
honor
than
she
was
of
her
own
when
he
met
edwin
at
the
works
he
silently
acquiesced
in
his
belief
also
that
their
late
companion
was
gone
with
dispatches
to
the
regent
who
was
now
removed
to
stirling
after
frequent
sallies
from
the
garrison
in
which
the
southrons
were
always
beaten
back
with
great
loss
the
lines
of
circumvallation
were
at
last
finished
and
wallace
hourly
anticipated
the
surrender
of
the
enemy
reduced
for
want
of
provisions
and
seeing
all
succors
cut
off
by
the
seizure
of
the
fleet
the
inhabitants
detesting
their
new
rulers
collected
in
bands
and
lying
in
wait
for
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
murdered
them
secretly
and
in
great
numbers
but
here
the
evil
did
not
end
for
by
the
punishments
which
the
governor
thought
proper
to
inflict
by
lots
on
the
guilty
or
the
guiltless
he
not
being
able
to
discover
who
were
actually
the
assassins
the
distress
of
the
town
was
augmented
to
a
horrible
degree
such
a
state
of
things
could
not
be
long
maintained
aware
that
should
he
continue
in
the
fortress
his
troops
must
assuredly
perish
either
by
insurrection
within
or
from
the
enemy
without
the
southron
commander
determined
no
longer
to
wait
the
appearance
of
a
relief
which
might
never
arrive
and
to
stop
the
internal
confusion
he
sent
a
flag
of
truce
to
wallace
accepting
and
signing
his
offered
terms
of
capitulation
by
this
deed
he
engaged
to
open
the
gates
at
sunset
but
begged
the
interval
between
noon
and
that
hour
to
allow
him
time
to
settle
the
animosity
between
his
men
and
the
people
before
he
should
surrender
his
brave
followers
entirely
into
the
hands
of
the
scots
having
dispatched
his
assent
to
this
request
of
the
governor
wallace
retired
to
his
own
tent
that
he
had
effected
his
purpose
without
the
carnage
which
must
have
ensued
had
he
again
stormed
the
place
gratified
his
humanity
and
congratulating
himself
on
such
a
termination
of
the
siege
he
turned
with
more
than
usual
cheerfulness
toward
a
herald
who
brought
him
a
packet
from
the
north
the
man
withdrew
and
wallace
broke
the
seal
but
what
was
his
astonishment
to
find
it
a
citation
for
himself
to
repair
immediately
to
stirling
to
answer
it
said
certain
charges
brought
against
him
by
an
authority
too
illustrious
to
be
set
aside
without
examination
he
had
hardly
read
this
extraordinary
mandate
when
sir
simon
fraser
his
second
in
command
entered
and
with
consternation
in
his
looks
put
an
open
letter
into
his
hand
it
ran
as
follows
sir
simon
fraser
allegations
of
treason
against
the
liberties
of
scotland
having
been
preferred
against
sir
william
wallace
until
he
clears
himself
of
these
charges
to
the
thanes
of
scotland
here
assembled
you
sir
simon
fraser
are
directed
to
assume
in
his
stead
the
command
of
the
forces
which
form
the
blockade
of
berwick
and
as
the
first
act
of
your
duty
you
are
ordered
to
send
the
accused
toward
stirling
under
a
strong
guard
within
an
hour
after
you
receive
this
dispatch
signed
john
cummin
earl
of
badenoch
lord
regent
of
scotland
stirling
castle
wallace
returned
the
letter
to
fraser
with
an
undisturbed
countenance
i
have
received
a
similar
order
from
the
regent
said
he
and
though
i
can
not
guess
the
source
whence
these
accusations
spring
i
fear
not
to
meet
them
and
shall
require
no
guard
to
speed
me
forward
to
the
scene
of
my
defense
i
am
ready
to
go
my
friend
and
happy
to
resign
the
brave
garrison
that
has
just
surrendered
to
your
honor
and
lenity
fraser
answered
that
he
should
be
emulous
to
follow
his
example
in
all
things
and
to
abide
by
his
agreements
with
the
southron
governor
he
then
retired
to
prepare
the
army
for
the
departure
of
their
commander
and
much
against
his
feelings
to
call
out
the
escort
that
was
to
attend
the
calumniated
chief
stirling
when
the
marshal
of
the
army
read
to
the
officers
and
men
the
orders
of
the
regent
a
speechless
consternation
seized
on
one
part
of
the
troops
and
as
violent
an
indignation
agitated
the
other
to
tumult
the
veterans
who
had
followed
the
chief
of
ellerslie
from
the
first
hour
of
his
appearing
as
a
patriot
in
arms
could
not
brook
this
aspersion
upon
their
leader
honor
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
vehement
exhortations
of
the
no
less
incensed
though
more
moderate
scrymgeour
and
lockhart
they
would
have
risen
in
instant
revolt
though
persuaded
to
sheathe
their
swords
they
could
not
be
withheld
from
immediately
quitting
the
field
and
marching
directly
to
wallace
tent
he
was
conversing
with
edwin
when
they
arrived
and
in
some
measure
he
had
broken
the
shock
to
him
of
so
dishonoring
a
charge
on
his
friend
by
his
being
the
first
to
communicate
it
while
edwin
strove
to
guess
who
could
be
the
inventor
of
so
dire
a
falsehood
against
the
truest
of
scots
he
awakened
an
alarm
in
wallace
for
bruce
which
could
not
be
excited
for
himself
by
suggesting
that
perhaps
some
intimation
had
been
given
to
the
most
ambitious
of
the
thanes
respecting
the
arrival
of
their
rightful
prince
and
yet
returned
wallace
i
can
not
altogether
suppose
that
for
even
their
desires
of
could
not
torture
my
share
in
bruce
restoration
to
his
country
into
anything
like
treason
our
friend
rights
are
too
undisputed
for
that
and
all
i
should
dread
by
a
premature
discovery
of
his
being
in
scotland
would
be
secret
machinations
against
his
life
there
are
men
in
this
land
who
might
attempt
it
and
it
is
our
duty
my
dear
edwin
to
suffer
death
upon
the
rack
rather
than
betray
our
knowledge
of
him
but
added
he
with
a
smile
we
need
not
disturb
ourselves
with
such
thoughts
the
regent
is
in
our
prince
confidence
and
did
this
accusation
relate
to
him
he
would
not
on
such
a
plea
have
arraigned
me
as
a
traitor
edwin
again
revolved
in
his
mind
the
nature
of
the
charge
and
who
the
villain
could
be
who
had
made
it
and
at
last
suddenly
recollecting
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
he
asked
if
it
were
not
possible
that
he
a
stranger
who
had
so
sedulously
kept
himself
from
being
known
might
be
the
traitor
i
must
confess
to
you
continued
edwin
that
this
knight
who
ever
appeared
to
dislike
your
closest
friends
seems
to
me
the
most
probable
instigator
of
this
mischief
and
is
perhaps
the
author
of
the
strange
failure
of
communication
between
you
and
bruce
accounts
have
not
arrived
ever
since
bothwell
went
and
that
is
more
than
natural
though
brave
in
his
deeds
this
unknown
way
prove
only
the
more
subtle
spy
and
agent
of
our
enemies
wallace
changed
color
at
these
suggestions
but
merely
replied
a
few
hours
will
decide
your
suspicion
for
i
shall
lose
no
time
in
confronting
my
accuser
i
go
with
you
said
edwin
never
while
i
live
will
i
consent
to
lose
sight
of
you
again
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
tumultuous
approach
of
the
lanark
veterans
was
heard
from
without
the
whole
band
rushed
into
the
tent
and
stephen
ireland
who
was
foremost
raising
his
voice
above
the
rest
exclaimed
they
are
the
traitors
my
lord
who
accuse
you
it
is
determined
by
our
corrupted
thanes
that
scotland
shall
be
sacrificed
and
you
are
to
be
made
the
first
victim
think
they
then
that
we
will
obey
such
parricides
lead
us
on
thou
only
worthy
of
the
name
of
regent
and
we
will
hurl
these
usurpers
from
their
thrones
this
demand
was
reiterated
by
every
man
present
was
echoed
by
hundreds
who
surrounded
the
tent
the
bothwell
men
and
ramsay
followers
joined
the
men
of
lanark
and
the
mutiny
against
the
orders
of
the
regent
became
general
wallace
walked
out
into
the
open
field
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
forth
amongst
them
at
sight
of
him
the
air
resounded
with
acclamations
unceasingly
proclaiming
him
their
only
leader
but
stretching
out
his
arm
to
them
in
token
of
silence
they
became
profoundly
still
my
friends
and
brother
soldiers
cried
he
as
you
value
the
honor
of
william
wallace
as
you
have
hitherto
done
this
moment
yield
him
implicit
obedience
forever
shouted
the
bothwell
men
we
never
will
obey
any
other
rejoined
his
faithful
lanark
followers
and
with
an
increased
uproar
they
demanded
to
be
led
to
stirling
his
extended
hand
again
stilled
the
storm
and
he
resumed
you
shall
go
with
me
to
stirling
but

i
am

with
treason
it
is
his
duty
to
try
me
by
the
laws
of
my
country
it
is
mine
to
submit
to
the
inquisition
i
fear

not

i
invite
you
to
accompany
me
not
to
brand
me
with
infamy
by
passing
between
my
now
darkened
honor
and
the
light
of
justice
not
to
avenge
an
iniquitous
sentence
denounced
on
a
guiltless
man
but
to
witness
my
acquittal
and
in
that
my
triumph
over
them
who
through
my
breast
would
strike
at
what
is
greater
than
i
at
this
mild

every
upraised

dropped
before

wallace
turning
his
horse
into
the
path
which
led
toward

with
a
silent
determination
to
share
the
fate
of
their
master
fell
into
regular
marching

and
followed

edwin
rode
by
his
side
equally
wondering
at
the
unaffected
composure
with
which
he
sustained
such
a
weight
of
insult
and
at
the
men
who
could
be
so
unjust
as
to
lay
it
upon
him
at
the
west
of
the
camp
the
detachment
appointed
to
guard
wallace
in
his
arrest
came
up
with
him
it
was
with
difficulty
that
fraser
could
find
an
officer
who
would
command
it
and
he
who
did
at
last
consent
appeared
before
his
prisoner
with
downcast
eyes
seeming
rather
the
culprit
than
the
guard
wallace
observing
his
confusion
said
a
few
gracious
words
to
him
and
the
officer
more
overcome
by
this
than
he
could
have
been
with
reproaches
burst
into
tears
and
retired
into

chapter
lxxii
stirling
castle
wallace
entered
on
the
carse
of
stirling
that
scene
of
his
many
victories
and
beheld
its
northern
horizon
white
with
tents
officers
appointed
for
the
purpose
had
apprised
the
thanes
of
wallace
having
left
berwick
and
knowing
by
the
same
means
all
his
movements
an
armed
cavalcade
met
him
near
the
carron
to
hold
his
followers
in
awe
and
to
conduct
him
without
opposition
to
stirling
in
case
it
should
be
insufficient
to
quail
their
spirit
or
to
intimidate
him
who
had
never
yet
been
made
to
fear
by
mortal
man
the
regent
had
summoned
all
the
vassals
of
the
various
seigniories
of
cummin
and
planted
them
in
battle
array
before
the
walls
of
stirling
but
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
was
equally
indifferent
to
wallace
for
strong
in
integrity
he
went
serenely
forward
to
his
trial
and
though
inwardly
marveling
at
such
a
panoply
of
war
being
called
out
to
induce
him
to
comply
with
so
simple
an
act
of
obedience
to
the
laws
he
met
the
heralds
of
the
regent
with
as
much
ease
as
if
they
had
been
coming
to
congratulate
him
on
the
capitulation
of
berwick
the
ratification
of
which
he
brought
in
his
hand
by
his
order
his
faithful
followers
who
took
a
pride
in
obeying
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactness
the
injunctions
of
their
now
deposed
commander
encamped
under
sir
alexander
scrymgeour
to
the
northwest
of
the
castle
near
ballockgeich
it
was
then
night
in
the
morning
at
an
early
hour
wallace
was
summoned
before
the
council
in
the
citadel
on
his
into
that
room
which
he
had
left
the
dictator
of
the
kingdom
when
every
knee
bent
and
every
head
bowed
to
his
supreme
mandate
he
found
not
one
who
even
greeted
his
appearance
with
the
commonest
ceremony
of
courtesy
badenoch
the
regent
sat
upon
the
throne
with
evident
symptoms
of
being
yet
an
invalid
the
lords
athol
and
buchan
and
the
numerous
chiefs
of
the
clans
of
cummin
were
seated
on
his
right
on
his
left
were
arranged
the
earls
of
fife
and
lorn
lord
soulis
and
every
scottish
baron
of
power
who
at
any
time
bad
shown
himself
hostile
to
wallace
others
who
were
of
easy
faith
to
a
tale
of
malice
sat
with
them
and
the
rest
of
the
assembly
was
filled
up
with
men
of
better
families
than
personal
fame
and
whose
names
swelled
a
list
without
adding
any
true
importance
to
the
side
on
which
they
appeared
a
few
and
those
a
very
few
who
still
respected
wallace
were
present
not
because
they
were
sent
for
great
care
having
been
taken
not
to
summon
his
friends
but
in
consequence
of
a
rumor
of
the
charge
having
reached
them
and
these
were
the
lords
lennox
and
with
kirkpatrick
and
two
or
three
chieftains
from
the
western
highlands
none
of
them
had
arrived
till
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
council
being
opened
and
wallace
was
entering
at
one
door
as
they
appeared
at
the
other
at
sight
of
him
a
low
whisper
buzzed
through
the
hail
and
a
marshal
took
the
plumed
bonnet
from
his
hand
which
out
of
respect
to
the
nobility
of
scotland
he
had
raised
from
his
head
at
his
entrance
a
herald
meanwhile
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
sir
william
wallace
you
are
charged
with
treason
and
by
an
ordinance
of
fergus
the
first
you
must
stand
covered
before
the
representative
of
the
majesty
of
scotland
until
that
loyalty
be
proved
which
would
again
restore
you
to
a
seat
amongst
her
faithful
barons
wallace
with
the
same
equanimity
as
that
with
which
he
would
have
mounted
the
regal
chair
bowed
his
head
to
marshal
in
token
of
acquiescence
but
edwin
whose
indignation
was
reawakened
at
this
exclusion
of
his
friend
from
the
privilege
of
his
birth
said
something
so
warm
to
the
marshal
that
wallace
in
a
low
voice
was
obliged
to
check
his
vehemence
by
a
declaration
that
however
obsolete
the
custom
and
revived
in
his
case
only
it
was
his
determination
to
submit
himself
in
every
respect
to
whatever
was
exacted
of
him
by
the
laws
of
his
country
on
and
lennox
observing
him
stand
thus
before
the
bonneted
and
seated
chiefs
a
stretch
of
magisterial
prerogative
which
had
not
been
exercised
on
a
scottish
knight
for
many
a
century
they
took
off
their
caps
and
bowing
to
wallace
refused
to
occupy
their
places
on
the
benches
while
the
defender
of
scotland
stood
kirkpatrick
drew
eagerly
toward
him
and
throwing
down
his
casque
and
sword
at
his
feet
cried
in
a
loud
voice
lie
there
till
the
only
true
man
in
all
this
land
commands
me
to
take
ye
up
in
his
defense
he
alone
had
courage
to
look
the
southrons
in
the
face
and
to
drive
their
king
over
the
borders
while
his
present
accusers
skulked
in
their
chains
wallace
regarded
this
ebullition
from
the
heart
of
the
honest
veteran
with
a
look
that
was
eloquent
to
all
he
would
have
animatedly
praised
such
an
instance
of
fearless
gratitude
expressed
to
another
and
when
it
was
directed
to
himself
his
ingenuous
soul
showed
approbation
in
every
feature
of
his
beaming
countenance
is
it
thus
presumptuous
knight
of
ellerslie
cried
soulis
that
by
your
looks
you
dare
encourage
contumely
to
the
lord
regent
and
his
peers
wallace
did
not
deign
him
an
answer
but
turning
calmly
toward
the
throne
representative
of
my
king
said
he
in
duty
to
the
power
whose
authority
you
wear
i
have
obeyed
your
summons
and
i
here
await
the
appearance
of
the
accuser
who
has
had
the
hardihood
to
brand
the
name
of
william
wallace
with
disloyalty
to
prince
or
people
the
regent
was
embarrassed
he
did
not
suffer
his
eyes
to
meet
those
of
wallace
but
looked
down
in
manifest
confusion
during
this
address
and
then
without
reply
turned
to
lord
athol
and
called
on
him
to
open
the
charge
athol
required
not
a
second
summons
he
rose
immediately
and
in
a
bold
and
positive
manner
accused
wallace
of
having
been
won
over
by
philip
of
france
to
sell
those
rights
of
supremacy
to
him
which
with
a
feigned
patriotism
his
sword
had
wrested
from
the
grasp
of
england
for
this
treachery
philip
was
to
endow
him
with
the
sovereignty
of
scotland
and
as
a
pledge
of
the
compact
he
had
invested
him
with
the
principality
of
gascony
in
france
this
is
the
groundwork
of
his
treason
continued
athol
but
the
superstructure
is
to
be
cemented
with
our
blood
i
have
seen
a
list
in
his
own
handwriting
of
those
chiefs
whose
lives
are
to
pave
his
way
to
the
throne
at
this
point
of
the
charge
edwin
sprung
forward
but
wallace
perceiving
the
intent
of
his
movement
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
by
a
look
reminded
him
of
his
recently
repeated
engagement
to
keep
silent
produce
the
list
cried
lord
lennox
no
evidence
that
does
not
bring
proof
to
our
eyes
ought
to
have
any
weight
with
us
against
the
man
who
had
bled
in
every
vein
for
scotland
it
shall
be
brought
to
your
eyes
returned
athol
that
and
other
damning
proofs
shall
convince
this
credulous
country
of
its
abused
confidence
i
see
these
damning
proofs
now
cried
kirkpatrick
who
had
frowningly
listened
to
athol
the
abusers
of
my
country
confidence
betray
themselves
at
this
moment
by
their
eagerness
to
impeach
her
friends
and
i
pray
heaven
that
before
they
mislead
others
into
so
black
a
conspiracy
the
lie
in
their
throats
may
choke
its
inventors
we
all
know
cried
athol
turning
on
kirkpatrick
to
whom
you
belong
you
were
brought
with
this
shameless
grant
to
mangle
the
body
of
the
slain
cressingham
a
deed
which
brought
a
stigma
on
the
scottish
name
never
to
be
erased
by
the
disgrace
of
its
perpetrators
for
this
savage
triumph
did
you
sell
yourself
to
sir
william
wallace
and
a
bloody
champion
you
are
always
ready
for
your
secretly
murderous
master
hear
you
this
and
bear
it
cried
kirkpatrick
and
edwin
in
one
breath
and
grasping
their
daggers
edwin
flashed
in
his
hand
seize
them
cried
athol
my
life
is
threatened
by
his
myrmidons
marshals
instantly
approached
but
wallace
who
had
hitherto
stood
in
silent
dignity
turned
to
them
with
that
tone
of
justice
which
had
ever
commanded
from
his
lips
and
bade
them
forbear
touch
these
knights
at
your
peril
marshals
said
he
no
man
in
this
chamber
is
above
the
laws
and
they
protect
every
scot
who
resents
unjust
aspersions
upon
his
own
character
or
irrelevant
and
prejudicing
attacks
on
that
of
an
arraigned
friend
it
is
before
the
majesty
of
the
laws
that
i
now
stand
but
were
injury
to
usurp
its
place
not
all
the
lords
in
scotland
should
detain
me
a
moment
in
a
scene
so
unworthy
of
my
country
the
marshals
retreated
for
they
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
with
implicit
deference
the
opinion
of
sir
william
wallace
on
the
laws
and
though
he
now
stood
in
the
light
of
their
violator
yet
memory
bore
testimony
that
he
had
always
read
them
aright
and
to
this
hour
had
ever
appeared
to
make
them
the
guide
of
his
actions
athol
saw
that
none
in
the
assembly
had
courage
to
enforce
this
act
of
violence
and
blazing
with
fury
he
poured
his
whole
wrath
upon
wallace
imperious
arrogant
traitor
cried
he
this
presumption
only
deepens
our
impression
of
your
guilt
demean
yourself
with
more
reverence
to
this
august
court
or
expect
to
be
sentenced
on
the
proof
which
such
insolence
amply
gives
we
require
no
other
to
proclaim
your
domineering
spirit
and
at
once
to
condemn
you
as
the
premeditated
tyrant
of
land
lord
athol
replied
wallace
what
is
just
i
would
say
in
the
face
of
all
the
courts
in
christendom
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
man
to
make
me
silent
when
i
see
the
laws
of
country
outraged
and
my
countrymen
oppressed
though
i
may
submit
my
own
cheek
to
the
blow
i
will
not
permit
theirs
to
share
the
stroke
i
have
answered
you
earl
to
this
point
and
am
ready
to
hear
you
to
the
end
athol
resumed
i
am
not
your
only
accuser
man
you
shall
see
one
whose
truth
can
not
be
doubted
and
whose
first
glance
will
bow
that
haughty
spirit
and
cover
that
bold
front
with
the
livery
of
shame
my
lord
cried
he
turning
to
the
regent
i
shall
bring
a
most
illustrious
witness
before
you
one
who
will
prove
on
oath
that
it
was
the
intention
of
this
this
angler
for
hearts
this
perverter
of
men
understandings
before
another
moon
to
bury
deep
in
blood
the
very
people
whom
he
now
insidiously
affects
to
protect
but
to
open
your
and
the
nation
eyes
at
once
to
overwhelm
him
with
his
fate
i
now
call
forth
the
evidence
the
marshals
opened
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
hall
and
led
a
lady
forward
habited
in
regal
splendor
and
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
a
veil
of
so
transparent
a
texture
that
her
costly
apparel
and
majestic
contour
were
distinctly
seen
through
it
she
was
conducted
to
a
chair
on
an
elevated
platform
a
few
paces
from
where
wallace
stood
on
her
being
seated
the
regent
rose
and
in
a
tremulous
voice
addressed
her
joanna
countess
of
strathearn
and
mar
princess
of
the
orkneys
we
adjure
thee
by
thy
princely
dignity
and
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
kings
to
bear
a
just
witness
to
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
charges
of
treason
and
conspiracy
now
brought
against
sir
william
wallace
the
name
of
his
accuser
made
wallace
start
and
the
sight
of
her
unblushing
face
for
she
threw
aside
her
veil
the
moment
she
was
addressed
overspread
his
cheek
with
a
tinge
of
that
shame
for
her
which
she
was
now
too
hardened
in
determined
crime
to
feel
herself
edwin
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
horror
while
she
casting
a
glance
at
wallace
in
which
the
full
purpose
of
her
soul
was
declared
turned
with
a
softened
though
majestic
air
to
the
regent
and
spoke
my
lord
said
she
you
see
before
you
a
woman
who
never
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
a
pang
till
an
evil
hour
brought
her
to
receive
an
obligation
from
that
insidious
treacherous
man
but
as
my
first
passion
has
ever
been
the
love
of
my
country
i
will
prove
it
to
this
good
assembly
by
making
a
confession
of
what
was
once
my
weakness
and
by
that
candor
i
trust
they
will
fully
honor
the
rest
of
my
narrative
a
clamor
of
approbation
resounded
through
the
hall
lennox
and
looked
on
each
other
with
amazement
kirkpatrick
recollecting
the
scenes
at
dumbarton
exclaimed
jezebel
but
the
ejaculation
was
lost
in
the
general
burst
of
applause
and
the
countess
opening
a
folded
paper
which
she
held
in
her
hand
in
a
calm
collected
voice
but
with
a
flushing
cheek
resumed
i
shall
read
my
further
deposition
i
have
written
it
that
my
memory
might
not
err
and
that
my
country
may
be
unquestionably
satisfied
of
the
accuracy
of
every
syllable
i
utter
she
paused
an
instant
drew
a
quick
breath
and
proceeded
reading
from
the
paper
thus
but
as
occasion
occurred
for
particularly
pointing
its
contents
she
turned
her
tutored
eye
upon
the
object
to
look
a
signet
on
her
mischief
i
am
not
to
tell
you
my
lord
that
sir
william
wallace
twice
released
the
late
earl
of
mar
and
myself
from
southron
captivity
our
deliverer
was
what
you
see
him
fraught
with
attractions
which
he
too
successfully
directed
against
the
peace
of
a
young
woman
married
to
a
man
of
paternal
years
while
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
he
seemed
to
consecrate
himself
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
to
me
alone
he
unveiled
his
straying
heart
i
revered
my
nuptial
vow
too
sincerely
to
listen
to
him
with
the
complacency
he
wished
but
i
blush
to
own
that
his
tears
his
agonies
of
love
his
manly
graces
and
the
virtues
i
believed
he
possessed
for
well
he
knows
to
feign
cooperating
with
my
gratitude
at
last
wrought
such
a
change
in
my
breast
that
i
became
wretched
no
guilty
wish
was
there
but
an
admiration
of
him
a
pity
which
undermined
my
health
and
left
me
miserable
i
forbade
him
to
approach
me
i
tried
to
wrest
him
from
my
memory
and
nearly
had
succeeded
when
i
was
informed
by
my
late
husband
nephew
the
youth
who
now
stands
beside
sir
william
wallace
that
he
was
returned
under
an
assumed
name
from
france
then
i
feared
that
all
my
inward
struggles
were
to
recommence
i
had
once
conquered
myself
for
abhorring
the
estrangement
of
my
thoughts
from
my
wedded
lord
when
he
died
i
only
yearned
to
appease
my
conscience
and
in
penance
for
my
involuntary
crime
i
refused
sir
william
wallace
my
hand
his
return
to
scotland
filled
me
with
tumults
which
only
they
who
would
sacrifice
all
they
prize
to
a
sense
of
duty
can
know
edwin
ruthven
left
me
at
huntingtower
and
that
very
evening
while
walking
alone
in
the
garden
i
was
surprised
by
the
sudden
approach
of
an
armed
man
he
threw
a
scarf
over
my
head
to
prevent
my
screams
but
i
fainted
with
terror
he
then
took
me
from
the
garden
by
the
way
he
had
entered
and
placing
me
on
a
horse
before
him
carried
me
whither
i
know
not
but
on
my
recovery
i
found
myself
in
a
chamber
with
a
woman
standing
beside
me
and
the
same
warrior
his
visor
was
so
closed
that
i
could
not
see
his
face
on
my
expressing
alarm
at
my
situation
he
addressed
me
in
french
telling
me
he
had
provided
a
man
to
carry
an
excuse
to
huntingtower
to
prevent
pursuit
and
then
he
put
a
letter
into
my
hand
which
he
said
he
brought
from
sir
william
wallace
anxious
to
know
the
purpose
of
this
act
and
believing
that
a
man
who
had
sworn
to
me
devoted
love
could
not
premeditate
a
more
serious
outrage
i
broke
the
seal
and
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
read
to
this
effect
that
his
passion
was
so
imperious
he
had
determined
to
make
me
his
in
spite
of
those
sentiments
of
female
delicacy
which
while
they
tortured
him
rendered
me
dearer
in
his
eyes
he
told
me
that
as
he
had
often
read
in
my
blushes
the
sympathy
which
my
too
severe
virtue
made
me
conceal
he
would
now
wrest
me
from
my
cheerless
widowhood
and
having
nothing
in
reality
to
reproach
myself
with
compel
me
to
be
happy
his
friend
the
only
confidant
of
his
love
had
brought
me
to
a
spot
whence
i
could
not
fly
there
i
should
remain
till
he
wallace
could
leave
the
army
for
a
few
days
and
throwing
himself
on
my
compassion
and
tenderness
he
received
as
the
most
faithful
of
lovers
the
fondest
of
husbands
this
letter
continued
the
countess
was
followed
by
many
others
and
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
latent
affection
in
my
heart
and
his
subduing
love
were
too
powerful
in
his
cause
how
his
letters
were
conveyed
i
know
not
but
they
were
duly
presented
to
me
by
the
woman
who
attended
me
at
last
the
knight
who
had
brought
me
to
the
place
and
who
wore
green
armor
and
a
green
plume
reappeared
prodigious
villain
broke
from
the
lips
of
edwin
the
countess
turned
her
eye
on
him
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
he
was
the
warrior
who
had
borne
me
from
huntingtower
and
from
that
hour
until
the
period
i
now
speak
of
i
had
never
seen
him
he
put
another
packet
into
my
hand
desiring
me
to
peruse
it
with
attention
and
return
sir
william
wallace
a
verbal
answer
by
him
yes
was
all
he
required
i
retired
to
open
it
and
what
was
my
horror
when
i
read
a
perfect
development
of
the
treasons
for
which
he
is
now
brought
to
account
by
some
mistake
of
my
character
he
had
conceived
me
to
be
ambitious
and
knowing
himself
to
be
the
master
of
my
heart
he
fancied
himself
lord
of
my
conscience
also
he
wrote
that
until
he
saw
me
he
had
no
other
end
in
his
exertions
for
scotland
than
her
rescue
from
a
foreign
yoke
added
he
the
moment
in
which
i
first
beheld
my
adored
joanna
i
aspired
to
place
a
crown
on
her
brow
be
then
told
me
that
he
did
not
deem
the
time
of
its
presentation
to
him
on
the
carse
of
stirling
a
safe
juncture
for
its
acceptance
neither
was
he
tempted
to
run
the
risk
of
maintaining
an
unsteady
throne
when
i
was
not
free
to
partake
it
but
since
the
death
of
lord
mar
every
wish
every
hope
was
and
then
he
determined
to
become
a
king
philip
of
france
had
made
secret
articles
with
him
to
that
end
he
was
to
hold
scotland
of
him
while
to
make
the
surrender
of
his
independence
sure
to
philip
and
its
scepter
to
himself
and
his
posterity
he
attempted
to
persuade
me
there
would
be
no
crime
in
destroying
the
chiefs
whose
names
he
enrolled
in
this
list
the
pope
he
added
would
absolve
me
from
a
transgression
dictated
by
connubial
duty
and
on
our
bridal
day
he
proposed
the
deed
should
be
done
he
would
invite
all
the
lords
to
a
feast
and
poison
or
dagger
should
lay
them
at
his
feet
so
impious
a
proposal
restored
me
to
myself
my
love
at
once
turned
to
the
most
decided
abhorrence
and
hastening
to
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
i
told
him
to
carry
my
resolution
to
his
master
that
i
would
never
see
him
more
till
i
should
appear
as
his
accuser
before
the
tribunal
of
his
country
the
knight
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
my
purpose
but
in
vain
and
at
last
becoming
alarmed
at
the
punishment
which
might
overtake
himself
as
the
agent
of
such
treason
he
confessed
to
me
that
the
scene
of
his
first
appearance
at
linlithgow
was
devised
by
wallace
who
unknown
to
all
others
had
brought
him
from
france
to
assist
him
in
the
scheme
he
durst
not
confide
to
scotland
friends
if
i
would
guarantee
his
life
he
offered
to
take
me
from
the
place
where
i
was
then
confined
and
convey
me
safe
to
stirling
all
else
that
he
asked
was
that
i
would
allow
him
to
be
the
bearer
of
the
casket
which
contained
sir
william
wallace
letters
and
suffer
my
eyes
to
be
blindfolded
during
the
first
part
of
our
journey
this
i
consented
to
but
the
murderous
list
i
had
undesignedly
put
into
my
bosom
my
bead
was
again
wrapped
in
a
thick
veil
and
we
set
out
it
was
very
dark
and
we
traveled
long
and
swiftly
till
we
came
to
a
wood
there
was
neither
moon
nor
stars
to
point
out
any
habitation
but
being
overcome
with
fatigue
my
conductor
persuaded
me
to
dismount
and
take
rest
i
slept
beneath
the
trees
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
i
in
vain
looked
round
for
the
knight
and
called
him
he
was
gone
and
i
saw
him
no
more
i
then
explored
my
way
to
stirling
to
warn
my
country
of
its
danger
to
unmask
to
the
world
the
direst
hypocrite
that
ever
prostituted
the
name
of
virtue
the
countess
ceased
and
a
hundred
voices
broke
out
at
once
pouring
invectives
on
the
traitorous
ambition
of
sir
william
wallace
and
invoking
the
regent
to
pass
some
signal
condemnation
on
so
monstrous
a
crime
in
vain
kirkpatrick
thundered
forth
his
indignant
soul
he
was
unheard
in
the
tumult
but
going
up
to
the
countess
he
accused
her
to
her
face
of
falsehood
and
charged
her
with
a
design
from
some
really
treasonable
motive
to
destroy
the
only
sure
hope
of
her
country
and
will
you
not
speak
cried
edwin
in
agony
of
spirit
grasping
wallace
arm
will
you
not
speak
before
these
ungrateful
men
shall
dare
to
brand
your
name
with
infamy
make
yourself
be
heard
my
noblest
friend
confute
that
wicked
woman
who
too
surely
has
proved
what
i
suspected
that
this
knight
came
to
be
a
traitor
i
will
speak
my
edwin
returned
wallace
at
the
proper
moment
but
not
in
this
tumult
of
my
enemies
rely
on
it
your
friend
will
submit
to
no
unjust
decree
where
is
this
knight
of
the
green
plume
cried
lennox
almost
startled
in
his
opinion
of
wallace
by
the
consistency
of
the
narrative
no
mark
of
dishonor
shall
be
passed
on
sir
william
wallace
without
the
strictest
scrutiny
let
the
mysterious
stranger
be
found
and
confronted
with
lady
strathearn
notwithstanding
the
earl
insisting
on
impartial
justice
she
perceived
the
doubt
in
his
countenance
and
eager
to
maintain
her
advantage
replied
the
knight
i
fear
has
fled
beyond
our
search
but
that
i
may
not
want
a
witness
to
corroborate
the
love
i
once
bore
this
and
consequently
the
sacrifice
i
make
to
loyalty
in
thus
unveiling
him
to
the
world
i
call
upon
you
lord
lennox
to
say
whether
you
did
not
observe
at
dumbarton
castle
the
state
of
my
too
grateful
heart
lennox
who
well
remembered
her
conduct
in
the
citadel
of
that
fortress
hesitated
to
answer
aware
that
his
reply
might
substantiate
a
guilt
which
he
now
feared
would
be
but
too
strongly
manifest
every
ear
hung
on
his
answer
wallace
saw
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
and
determined
to
all
men
to
show
what
was
in
their
hearts
toward
the
earl
and
said
do
not
hesitate
my
lord
speak
all
that
you
know
or
think
of
me
could
the
deeds
of
my
life
be
written
on
yon
blue
vault
added
he
pointing
to
the
heavens
and
my
breast
be
laid
open
for
men
to
scan
i
should
be
content
for
then
scotland
would
know
me
as
my
creator
knows
me
and
the
evidence
which
now
makes
even
friendship
doubt
would
meet
the
reception
due
to
calumny
lord
lennox
felt
the
last
remark
and
stung
with
remorse
for
having
for
a
moment
credited
anything
against
the
frank
spirit
which
gave
him
this
permission
he
replied
to
lady
strathearn
questions
i
must
answer
that
at
dumbarton
i
did
perceive
her
preference
to
sir
william
wallace
but
i
never
saw
anything
in
him
to
warrant
the
idea
that
it
was
reciprocal
and
yet
were
it
even
so
that
bears
nothing
to
the
point
of
the
countess
accusation
and
notwithstanding
her
princely
rank
and
the
deference
all
would
pay
to
the
widow
of
lord
mar
as
true
scots
we
can
not
relinquish
to
a
single
witness
our
faith
in
a
man
who
has
so
eminently
served
his
country
no
cried
if
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
be
above
ground
he
shall
be
brought
before
this
tribunal
he
alone
can
be
the
traitor
and
to
destroy
us
by
exciting
suspicions
against
our
best
defender
he
has
wrought
with
his
own
false
pen
this
device
to
deceive
the
patriotic
widow
of
the
earl
of
mar
no
no
interrupted
she
i
read
the
whole
in
his
own
to
me
too
well
known
handwriting
and
this
list
of
the
chiefs
condemned
by
you
indeed
traitor
to
die
shall
fully
evince
his
guilt
even
your
name
too
generous
earl
is
in
the
horrid
catalogue
while
she
spoke
she
rose
eagerly
to
hand
to
him
the
scroll
let
me
now
speak
or
stab
me
to
the
heart
hastily
whispered
edwin
to
his
friend
wallace
did
not
withhold
him
for
he
guessed
what
would
be
the
remark
of
his
ardent
soul
hear
that
woman
cried
the
vehement
youth
to
the
regent
and
say
whether
she
now
speaks
the
language
of
one
who
had
ever
loved
the
virtues
of
sir
william
wallace
were
she
innocent
of
malice
toward
the
deliverer
of
scotland
would
she
not
have
rejoiced
in
suggestion
that
the
green
knight
is
the
traitor
or
if
that
scroll
she
has
now
given
into
the
regent
hand
be
too
nicely
forged
for
her
to
detect
its
not
being
indeed
the
handwriting
of
the
noblest
of
men
would
she
not
have
shown
some
sorrow
at
the
guilt
of
one
she
professes
once
to
have
loved
of
one
who
saved
herself
her
husband
and
her
child
from
perishing
but
here
her
malice
has
overstepped
her
art
and
after
having
promoted
the
success
of
her
tale
by
so
mingling
insignificant
truths
with
falsehoods
of
capital
import
that
in
acknowledging
the
one
we
seem
to
grant
the
other
she
falls
into
her
own
snare
even
a
beardless
boy
can
now
discern
that
however
vile
the
green
knight
may
be
she
shares
his
wickedness
while
edwin
spoke
lady
stathearn
countenance
underwent
a
thousand
changes
twice
she
attempted
to
rise
and
interrupt
him
but
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
having
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
with
a
menacing
determination
to
prevent
her
she
found
herself
obliged
to
remain
quiescent
full
of
a
fear
that
wallace
had
confided
to
her
nephew
the
last
scene
in
his
tent
she
started
up
as
he
seemed
to
pause
and
with
assumed
mildness
again
addressing
the
regent
said
that
before
this
apparently
ingenuous
defense
could
mislead
impartial
minds
she
thought
it
just
to
inform
the
council
of
the
infatuated
attachment
of
edwin
ruthven
to
the
accused
for
she
had
ample
cause
to
assert
that
the
boy
was
so
bewitched
by
his
commander
who
had
flattered
his
youthful
vanity
by
loading
him
with
distinctions
only
due
to
approved
valor
in
manhood
that
he
was
ready
at
any
time
to
sacrifice
every
consideration
of
truth
reason
and
duty
to
please
sir
william
wallace
such
may
be
in
a
boy
observed
lord
interrupting
her
but
as
i
know
no
occasion
in
which
it
is
possible
for
sir
william
wallace
to
falsify
the
truth
i
call
upon
him
in
justice
to
himself
and
to
his
country
to
reply
to
three
questions
wallace
bowed
to
the
venerable
earl
and
he
proceeded
sir
william
wallace
are
you
guilty
of
the
charge
brought
against
you
of
a
design
to
mount
the
throne
of
scotland
by
means
of
the
king
of
france
wallace
replied
i
never
designed
to
mount
the
throne
of
scotland
either
by
my
own
means
or
by
any
other
man
proceeded
was
this
scroll
containing
the
names
of
certain
scottish
chiefs
noted
down
for
assassination
written
by
you
or
under
your
connivance
i
never
saw
the
scroll
nor
heard
of
the
scroll
until
this
hour
and
harder
than
death
is
the
pang
at
my
heart
when
a
scottish
chief
finds
it
necessary
to
ask
me
such
a
question
regarding
a
people
to
save
even
the
least
of
whom
he
has
often
seen
me
risk
my
life
another
question
replied
and
then
bravest
of
men
if
your
country
acquits
you
not
in
thought
and
deed
campbell
of
sits
no
more
amongst
its
judges
what
is
your
knowledge
of
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
that
in
preference
to
any
scottish
friend
you
should
intrust
him
with
your
wishes
respecting
the
countess
of
strathearn
wallace
answer
was
brief
i
never
had
any
wishes
respecting
the
wife
or
the
widow
of
my
friend
the
earl
of
mar
that
i
did
not
impart
to
every
chief
in
the
camp
and
those
wishes
went
no
further
than
for
her
safety
as
to
love
that
is
a
passion
i
shall
know
no
more
and
lady
strathearn
alone
can
say
what
is
the
end
she
aims
at
by
attributing
feelings
to
me
with
regard
to
her
which
i
never
conceived
and
words
which
i
never
uttered
like
this
passion
with
which
she
says
she
inspired
me
added
he
turning
his
eyes
steadfastly
on
her
face
was
the
knight
of
the
green
plume
you
are
all
acquainted
with
the
manner
of
his
introduction
to
me
at
linlithgow
by
the
account
that
he
then
gave
of
himself
you
all
know
as
much
of
him
as
i
did
till
on
the
night
that
he
left
me
at
berwick
and
then
i
found
him
like
this
story
of
lady
strathearn
all
a
fable
what
is
his
proper
title
name
him
on
your
knighthood
exclaimed
buchan
for
he
shall
yet
be
dragged
forth
to
support
the
veracity
of
my
illustrious
kinswoman
and
to
fully
unmask
his
insidious
accomplice
your
kinswoman
earl
buchan
replied
wallace
can
best
answer
your
question
lord
athol
approached
the
regent
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
this
unworthy
representative
of
the
generous
bruce
immediate
rose
from
his
seat
sir
william
wallace
said
he
you
have
replied
to
the
questions
of
lord
but
where
are
your
witnesses
to
prove
that
what
you
have
spoken
is
the
truth
wallace
was
struck
with
surprise
at
this
address
from
a
man
who
whatever
might
be
demanded
of
him
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
office
he
believed
could
not
be
otherwise
than
his
friend
because
from
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
both
by
bruce
and
himself
he
must
be
fully
aware
of
the
impossibility
of
these
allegations
being
true
but
wallace
astonishment
was
only
for
a
moment
he
now
saw
with
an
eye
that
pierced
through
the
souls
of
the
whole
assembly
and
with
collected
firmness
he
replied
my
witnesses
are
in
the
bosom
of
every
scotsman
i
can
not
find
them
in
mine
interrupted
athol
nor
in
mine
was
echoed
from
various
parts
of
the
hall
invalidate
the
facts
brought
against
you
by
legal
evidence
not
a
mere
rhetorical
appeal
sir
william
wallace
added
the
regent
else
the
sentence
of
the
law
must
be
passed
on
so
tacit
an
acknowledgment
of
guilt
acknowledgment
of
guilt
cried
wallace
with
a
flush
of
indignation
suffusing
his
noble
brow
if
any
one
of
the
chiefs
who
have
just
spoken
knew
the
beat
of
an
honest
heart
they
would
not
have
declared
that
they
heard
no
voice
proclaim
the
integrity
of
william
wallace
let
them
look
out
on
yon
carse
where
they
saw
me
refuse
that
crown
offered
by
themselves
which
my
accuser
alleges
i
would
yet
obtain
by
their
blood
let
them
remember
the
banks
of
the
clyde
where
i
rejected
the
scottish
throne
offered
me
by
edward
let
these
facts
bear
witness
for
me
and
if
they
be
insufficient
look
on
scotland
now
for
the
third
time
rescued
by
my
arm
from
the
grasp
of
a
usurper
that
scroll
locks
the
door
of
the
kingdom
upon
her
enemies
as
he
spoke
he
threw
the
capitulation
of
berwick
on
the
table
it
struck
a
pause
into
the
minds
of
the
lords
they
gazed
with
pallid
countenances
and
without
a
word
on
the
parchment
where
it
lay
while
he
proceeded
if
my
actions
that
you
see
do
not
convince
you
of
my
integrity
then
believe
the
unsupported
evidence
of
words
the
tale
of
a
woman
whose
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
memory
of
the
honorable
man
whose
name
she
once
bore
i
would
publicly
unravel
believe
her
and
leave
wallace
naught
of
his
country
to
remember
but
that
he
has
served
it
and
that
it
is
unjust
noblest
of
scots
cried
coming
toward
him
did
your
accuser
come
in
the
shape
of
an
angel
of
light
still
we
believe
your
life
in
preference
to
her
testimony
for
god
himself
speaks
on
your
side
servants
he
declares
be
known
by
their
fruits
and
have
not
yours
been
peace
to
scotland
and
to
men
they
are
the
of
his
hypocrisy
cried
athol
alarmed
at
the
looks
of
the
assembly
they
are
the
baits
by
which
he
cheats
fools
soulis
they
are
snares
which
shall
catch
us
no
more
was
now
the
general
acclamation
and
in
proportion
to
the
transitory
respect
which
had
made
them
bow
but
for
a
moment
to
virtue
they
now
vociferated
their
center
both
of
wallace
and
this
his
last
achievement
inflamed
with
rage
at
the
manifest
determination
to
misjudge
his
commander
and
maddened
at
the
contumely
with
which
their
envy
affected
to
treat
him
kirkpatrick
threw
off
all
restraint
and
with
the
bitterness
of
his
reproaches
still
more
incensed
the
jealousy
of
the
nobles
and
augmented
the
tumult
lennox
vainly
attempting
to
make
himself
heard
drew
toward
wallace
hoping
by
that
movement
to
at
least
show
on
whose
side
he
thought
justice
lay
at
this
moment
while
the
uproar
raged
with
redoubled
clamor
the
one
party
denouncing
the
cummins
as
the
source
of
this
conspiracy
against
the
life
of
wallace
the
other
demanding
that
sentence
should
instantly
be
passed
upon
him
as
a
traitor
the
door
burst
open
and
bothwell
covered
with
dust
and
followed
by
a
throng
of
armed
knights
rushed
into
the
center
of
the
hall
who
is
it
ye
arraign
cried
the
young
chief
looking
indignantly
around
him
is
it
not
your
deliverer
you
would
destroy
the
romans
could
not
accuse
the
guilty
manlius
in
sight
of
the
capitol
he
had
preserved
but
you
worse
than
heathens
bring
your
benefactor
to
the
scene
of
his
victories
and
there
condemn
him
for
serving
you
too
well
has
he
not
plucked
you
this
third
time
out
of
the
furnace
that
would
have
consumed
you
and
yet
in
this
hour
you
would
sacrifice
him
to
the
disappointed
passions
of
a
woman
falsest
of
thy
sex
cried
he
turning
to
the
countess
who
shrunk
before
the
penetrating
eyes
of
andrew
murray
do
i
not
know
thee
have
i
not
read
thine
unfeminine
thy
vindictive
heart
you
would
destroy
the
man
you
could
not
seduce
wallace
cried
he
speak
would
not
this
woman
have
persuaded
you
to
disgrace
the
name
of
mar
when
my
uncle
died
did
she
not
urge
you
to
intrigue
for
that
crown
which
she
knew
you
had
so
loyally
declined
my
errand
here
answered
wallace
is
to
defend
myself
not
to
accuse
others
i
have
shown
that
i
am
innocent
and
my
judges
will
not
look
on
the
proofs
they
obey
not
the
laws
in
their
judgment
and
whatever
may
be
the
decree
i
shall
not
acknowledge
its
authority
as
he
spoke
he
turned
away
and
walked
with
a
firm
step
out
of
the
hall
his
disappearance
gave
the
signal
for
a
tumult
more
threatening
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
than
if
the
armies
of
edward
had
been
in
the
midst
of
them
it
was
brother
against
brother
friend
against
friend
the
lords
lennox
bothwell
and
were
vehement
against
the
unfairness
with
which
sir
william
wallace
bad
been
treated
kirkpatrick
declared
that
no
arguments
could
be
used
with
men
so
devoid
of
reason
and
words
of
reproach
and
reviling
passing
on
all
sides
swords
were
fiercely
drawn
the
countess
of
strathearn
seeing
herself
neglected
by
even
her
friends
in
the
strife
and
fearful
that
the
party
of
wallace
might
at
last
gain
the
ascendancy
and
that
herself
then
without
her
traitor
corslet
on
her
breast
might
meet
their
hasty
vengeance
rose
abruptly
and
giving
her
hand
to
a
herald
hurried
out
of
the
assembly
chapter
lxxiii
ballochgeich
the
marshals
with
difficulty
interrupted
the
mortal
attack
which
the
enemies
and
friends
of
wallace
made
on
each
other
several
of
the
cummins
were
maimed
lord
athol
himself
was
severely
wounded
by
kirkpatrick
but
the
teacherous
regent
gladly
saw
that
none
on
his
side
were
hurt
unto
death
with
horrid
menaces
the
two
parties
separated
the
one
to
the
regent
apartments
the
other
to
the
camp
of
wallace
lord
bothwell
found
him
encircled
by
his
veterans
in
whose
breasts
he
was
trying
to
allay
the
storm
raging
there
against
the
injustice
of
the
regent
and
the
ingratitude
of
the
scottish
lords
at
sight
of
the
young
and
ardent
bothwell
their
clamor
to
be
led
instantly
to
revenge
the
indignity
offered
to
their
general
redoubled
and
murray
not
less
incensed
turning
to
them
exclaimed
yes
my
friends
keep
quiet
for
a
few
hours
and
then
what
honor
commands
we
will
do
at
this
assurance
they
retired
to
their
quarters
and
bothwell
turned
with
wallace
into
his
tent
before
you
utter
a
word
concerning
the
present
scenes
cried
wallace
tell
me
how
is
the
hope
of
scotland
the
only
earthly
stiller
of
these
horrid
tumults
alas
replied
bothwell
after
regaining
by
a
valor
worthy
of
his
destiny
every
fortress
north
of
the
forth
his
last
and
greatest
achievement
was
making
himself
master
of
scone
but
in
storming
its
walls
a
fragment
of
stone
falling
heavily
terribly
rent
the
muscles
of
his
breast
and
now
woe
to
scotland
he
lies
at
huntingtower
reduced
to
infant
weakness
all
this
you
would
have
known
had
you
received
his
letters
but
villainy
must
have
been
widely
at
work
for
none
of
yours
have
reached
his
hands
this
intelligence
respecting
bruce
was
a
more
mortal
blow
to
wallace
than
all
he
had
just
sustained
in
his
own
person
he
remained
silent
but
his
mind
was
thronged
with
thoughts
was
scotland
to
be
indeed
lost
was
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
achieved
to
have
been
done
in
vain
and
should
he
be
fated
to
behold
her
again
made
a
sacrifice
to
the
jealous
rivalry
of
her
selfish
and
contending
nobles
bothwell
continued
to
speak
of
the
prince
and
added
that
it
was
with
reluctance
he
had
left
him
even
to
share
the
anticipated
success
at
berwick
but
bruce
impatient
to
learn
the
issue
of
the
siege
as
still
no
letters
arrived
from
that
quarter
had
dispatched
him
back
to
the
borders
at
dunfermline
he
was
stricken
with
horror
by
the
information
that
treason
had
been
alleged
against
wallace
and
turning
his
steps
westward
he
flew
to
give
that
support
to
his
innocence
which
the
malignity
of
his
enemies
might
render
needful
the
moment
i
heard
how
you
were
beset
continued
bothwell
i
dispatched
a
messenger
to
lord
ruthven
warning
him
not
to
alarm
bruce
with
such
tidings
but
to
send
hither
all
the
spare
forces
in
perthshire
to
maintain
you
in
your
rights
no
force
my
dear
bothwell
must
be
used
so
hold
me
in
a
power
which
now
would
only
keep
alive
a
spirit
of
discord
in
my
country
if
i
dare
apply
the
words
of
my
divine
master
i
would
say
i
came
not
to
bring
a
sword
but
peace
to
the
people
of
scotland
then
if
they
are
weary
of
me
let
me
go
bruce
will
recover
they
will
rally
round
his
standard
and
all
be
well
oh
wallace
wallace
cried
bothwell
the
scene
i
have
this
day
witnessed
is
enough
to
make
a
traitor
of
me
i
could
forswear
my
insensible
country
i
could
immolate
its
ungrateful
chieftains
on
those
very
lands
which
your
generous
arm
restored
to
these
worthless
men
he
threw
himself
into
a
seat
and
leaned
his
burning
forehead
against
his
hand
cousin
you
declare
my
sentiments
rejoined
edwin
my
soul
can
never
again
associate
with
these
sons
of
envy
i
can
not
recognize
a
countryman
in
any
one
of
them
and
should
sir
william
wallace
quit
a
land
so
unworthy
of
his
virtues
where
he
goes
i
will
go
his
asylum
shall
be
my
country
and
edwin
ruthven
will
forget
that
he
ever
was
a
scot
never
cried
wallace
turning
on
him
one
of
those
looks
which
struck
conviction
into
the
heart
is
man
more
just
than
god
though
a
thousand
of
your
countrymen
offend
you
by
their
crimes
yet
while
there
remains
one
honest
scot
for
his
sake
and
his
posterity
it
is
your
duty
to
be
a
patriot
a
nation
is
one
great
family
and
every
individual
in
it
is
as
much
bound
to
promote
the
general
good
as
a
brother
or
a
father
to
maintain
the
welfare
of
his
nearest
kindred
and
it
the
transgression
of
one
son
be
no
arouse
for
the
omission
of
another
in
like
manner
the
ruin
these
turbulent
lords
would
bring
upon
scotland
is
no
excuse
for
your
desertion
of
your
interest
i
would
not
leave
the
helm
of
my
country
did
she
not
thrust
me
from
it
but
though
cast
by
her
into
the
waves
would
you
not
blush
for
your
friend
should
he
wish
her
other
than
a
peaceful
haven
edwin
spoke
not
but
putting
the
hand
of
wallace
to
his
lips
left
the
tent
oh
cried
bothwell
looking
after
him
that
the
breast
of
woman
had
but
half
that
boy
tenderness
and
yet
all
of
that
dangerous
sex
are
not
like
this
lady
strathearn
tell
me
try
friend
did
she
not
when
she
disappeared
so
strangely
from
huntingtower
fly
to
you
i
now
suspect
from
certain
remembrances
that
she
and
the
green
knight
are
one
aid
the
same
person
acknowledge
it
and
i
will
unmask
her
at
once
to
the
court
she
has
deceived
she
has
deceived
no
one
replied
wallace
before
she
spoke
the
members
of
that
court
were
determined
to
brand
me
with
guilt
and
her
charge
merely
supplied
the
place
of
others
which
they
would
have
devised
against
me
whatever
she
may
be
my
dear
bothwell
for
the
sake
of
whose
name
she
once
bore
let
us
not
expose
her
to
open
shame
her
love
or
her
hatred
are
alike
indifferent
to
me
now
for
i
neither
of
them
do
i
owe
that
innate
malice
of
my
countrymen
which
has
only
made
her
calumny
the
occasion
of
manifesting
their
resolution
to
make
me
infamous
but
that
my
friend
is
beyond
her
compass
i
have
done
my
duty
to
scotland
and
that
conviction
must
live
in
every
honest
heart
ay
and
with
dishonest
too
for
did
they
not
fear
my
integrity
they
would
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
deprive
me
of
power
heaven
shield
our
prince
i
dread
that
badenoch
next
shaft
may
be
at
him
no
cried
bothwell
all
is
leveled
at
his
best
friend
in
a
low
voice
i
taxed
the
regent
with
disloyalty
for
permitting
this
outrage
on
you
and
his
basely
envious
answer
was
removal
is
bruce
security
who
will
acknowledge
him
when
they
know
that
this
man
is
his
dictator
wallace
sighed
at
this
reply
which
only
confirmed
him
in
his
resolution
and
he
told
bothwell
that
he
saw
no
alternative
if
he
wished
to
still
the
agitations
of
his
country
and
preserve
its
prince
from
premature
discovery
but
to
indeed
remove
the
subject
of
all
these
contentions
from
their
sight
attempt
it
not
exclaimed
bothwell
propose
but
a
step
toward
that
end
and
you
will
determine
me
to
avenge
my
country
at
the
peril
of
my
own
life
on
all
in
that
accursed
assembly
who
have
menaced
yours
in
short
the
young
earl
denunciations
were
so
earnest
against
the
lords
in
stirling
that
wallace
thinking
it
dangerous
to
exasperate
him
further
consented
to
remain
in
his
camp
till
the
arrival
of
ruthven
should
bring
him
the
advantage
of
his
counsel
the
issue
showed
that
bothwell
was
not
mistaken
the
majority
of
the
scottish
nobles
envied
wallace
his
glory
and
hated
him
for
that
virtue
which
drew
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
compare
him
with
their
selfish
courses
the
regent
hoping
to
become
the
first
in
bruce
favor
was
not
less
urgent
to
ruin
the
man
who
so
deservedly
stood
the
highest
in
that
prince
esteem
he
had
therefore
entered
warmly
into
the
project
of
lady
strathearn
but
when
during
a
select
conference
between
them
previous
to
her
open
charge
of
wallace
she
named
sir
thomas
de
longueville
as
one
of
his
foreign
emissaries
cummin
observed
if
you
would
have
your
accusation
succeed
do
not
mention
that
knight
at
all
he
is
my
friend
he
is
now
ill
near
perth
and
must
know
nothing
of
this
affair
till
it
be
over
should
he
live
he
will
nobly
thank
you
for
your
forbearance
should
he
die
i
will
repay
you
as
becomes
your
nearest
kinsman
all
were
thus
united
in
one
determined
effort
to
hurl
wallace
from
his
station
in
the
state
but
when
they
believed
that
done
they
quarreled
amongst
themselves
in
deciding
who
was
to
fill
the
great
military
office
which
his
prowess
had
now
rendered
a
post
rather
of
honor
than
of
danger
in
the
midst
of
these
feuds
sir
simon
fraser
abruptly
appeared
in
the
his
countenance
proclaimed
his
tidings
lennox
and
who
had
duly
attended
in
hopes
of
bringing
over
some
of
the
more
pliable
chiefs
to
embrace
the
cause
of
justice
listened
with
something
like
exultation
to
his
suddenly
disastrous
information
when
the
english
governor
at
berwick
learned
the
removal
of
wallace

out

attacking

gave
them
a
total
defeat

before
a
messenger
from
tiviotdale
arrived
to
inform
the

that
king
edward
was
himself
within
a

miles
of

were
already
there
they
had
arrived
early
in
the
morning
but
with
unpromising
tidings
of
bruce
the
state
of
his
wound
had
induced
a
constant
delirium
but
still
wallace
clung
to
the
hope
that
his
country
was
not
doomed
to
perish
that
its
prince
recovery
was
only
protracted
in
the
midst
of
this
anxiety
lennox
entered
and
relating
what
he
had
just
heard

the
whole

wallace
started
from
his
seat
his
hand
mechanically
caught
up
his
sword
which
lay
upon
the
table
lennox
gazed
at
him
with
animated
veneration
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
citadel
cried
he
who
does
not
appear
at
his
end
and
incapable
of
facing
this
foe
will
you
wallace
again
condescend
to
save
a
country
that
has
treated
you
so
ungratefully
i
would
die
in
its
trenches
cried
the
chief
with
a
generous
forgiveness
of
all
his
injuries
suffusing
his
magnanimous
heart
lord
soon
after
appeared
and
corroborating
the
testimony
of
lennox
added
that
on
the
regent
sending
word
to
the
troops
on
the
south
of
stirling
that
in
consequence
of
the
treason
of
sir
william
wallace
the
supreme
command
was
taken
from
him
and
they
must
immediately
march
out
under
the
orders
of
sir
simon
fraser
to
face
a
new
incursion
of
the
enemy
they
began
to
murmur
among
themselves
saying
that
since
wallace
was
found
to
be
a
traitor
they
knew
not
whom
to
trust
but
certainly
it
should
not
be
a
beaten
general
with
these
whisperings
they
slid
away
from
their
standards
and
when
left
them
they
were
dispersed
on

the

a
large

alleging
that

locking

stern
assent
to
the
only

turned
ashy
pale
while
his
silence
granted
to
lord
the
necessity
of
imploring
sir
william
wallace
to
again
stretch
out
his
arm
in
their
behalf
with
this
embassy
the
venerable
chief
had
returned
exultingly
to
ballochgeich
and
the
so
lately
branded
wallace
branded
as
the
intended
betrayer
of
scotland
was
solicited
by
his
very
accusers
to
assume
the
trust
of

sole
defense

is
the
triumph
of
virtue
whispered
edwin
to
his
friend
as
he
vaulted
on

horse
a
luminous
smile

wallace
acknowledged
that
he
felt
the
tribute
and
looking
up
to
heaven
ere
he
placed
his
helmet
on
his
head
he
said
thence
comes
my
power
and
the
satisfaction
it
brings
whether
attended
by
man

can
not

crown
it
with
victory
and
forever
after
bind
the
brows
of
our
rightful
sovereign
with
peace
while
wallace
pursued
his
march
the
regent
was
quite
at
a
stand
confounded
at
the
turn
which
events
had
taken
and
hardly
knowing
whether
to
make
another
essay
to
collect
forces
for
the
support
of
their
former
leader
or
to
follow
the
refractory
counsels
of
his
lords
and
await
in
inactivity
the
issue
of
the
expected
battle
he
knew
not
bow
to
act
but
a
letter
from
lady
strathearn
decided
him
though
partly
triumphant
in
her
charges
yet
the
accusations
of
bothwell
had
disconcerted
her
and
though
the
restoration
of
wallace
to
his
undisputed
authority
in
the
state
seemed
to
her
next
to
impossible
still
she
resolved
to
take
another
step
to
confirm
her
influence
over
the
discontented
of
her
country
and
most
likely
to
insure
the
vengeance
she
panted
to
bring
upon
her
victim
head
to
this
end
on
the
very
evening
that
she
retreated
in
terror
from
the
council
hall
she
set
forward
to
the
borders
and
easily
passing
thence
to
the
english
camp
then
pitched
at
alnwick
was
soon
admitted
to
the
castle
where
de
warenne
lodged
she
was
too
well
taught
in
the
school
of
vanity
not
to
have
remarked
the
admiration
with
which
that
earl
had
regarded
her
while
he
was
a
prisoner
in
stirling
and
hoping
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
persuasion
of
her
charms
she
opened
her
mission
with
no
less
art
than
effect
de
warren
was
made
to
believe
that
on
the
strength
of
a
passion
wallace
had
conceived
for
her
and
which
she
treated
with
disdain
he
had
repented
of
his
former
refusal
of
the
crown
of
scotland
and
misled
by
a
hope
that
she
would
not
repeat
her
rejection
of
his
hand
could
it
present
her
a
scepter
he
was
now
attempting
to
compass
that
dignity
by
the
most
complicated
intrigues
she
then
related
how
at
her
instigation
the
regent
had
deposed
him
from
his
military
command
and
she
ended
with
saying
that
impelled
by
loyalty
to
edward
whom
her
better
reason
now
recognized
as
the
lawful
sovereign
of
her
country
she
had
come
to
exhort
that
monarch
to
renew
his
invasion
of
the
kingdom
intoxicated
with
her
beauty
and
enraptured
by
a
manner
which
seemed
to
tell
him
that
a
softer
sentiment
than
usual
had
made
her
select
him
as
the
embassador
to
the
king
de
warenne
greedily
drank
in
all
her
words
and
ere
he
allowed
this
to
him
romantic
conference
to
break
up
he
had
thrown
himself
at
her
feet
and
implored
her
by
every
impassioned
argument
to
grant
him
the
privilege
of
presenting
her
to
edward
as
his
intended
bride
de
warenne
was
in
the
meridian
of
life
and
being
fraught
with
a
power
at
court
beyond
most
of
his
peers
she
determined
to
accept
his
hand
and
wield
its
high
influence
to
the
destruction
of
wallace
even
should
she
be
compelled
in
the
act
to
precipitate
her
country
in
his
fall
de
warenne
drew
from
her
a
consent
and
while
he
poured
forth
the
transports
of
a
happy
lover
he
was
not
so
much
enamored
of
the
fine
person
of
lady
strathearn
as
to
be
altogether
insensible
to
the
advantages
which
his
alliance
with
her
would
give
to
edward
in
his
scottish
pretensions
and
as
it
would
consequently
increase
his
own
importance
with
that
monarch
he
lost
no
time
in
communicating
the
circumstances
to
him
edward
suspected
something
in
this
sudden
attachment
of
the
countess
which
should
it
transpire
might
cool
the
ardor
of
his
officer
for
uniting
so
useful
an
agent
to
his
cause
therefore
having
highly
approved
de
warenne
conduct
in
affair
to
hasten
the
nuptials
he
proposed
being
present
at
their
solemnization
that
very
evening
the
solemn
vows
which
lady
strathearn
then
pledged
at
the
altar
to
be
pronounced
by
her
with
no
holy
awe
of
the
marriage
contract
but
rather
as
those
alone
by
which
she
swore
to
complete
her
revenge
on
wallace
and
by
depriving
him
of
life
prevent
the
climax
to
her
misery
of
seeing
him
what
she
believed
he
intended
to
become
the
husband
of
helen
mar
the
day
after
she
became
de
warenne
wife
she
accompanied
him
by
sea
to
berwick
and
from
that
place
she
dispatched
messengers
to
the
regent
and
to
other
nobles
her
kinsmen
fraught
with
promises
which
edward
in
the
event
of
success
had
solemnly
pledged
himself
to
ratify
her
embassador
arrived
at
stirling
the
day
succeeding
that
in
which
wallace
and
his
troops
had
marched
from
ballochgeich
the
letters
brought
were
eagerly
opened
by
badenoch
and
his
chieftains
and
they
found
their
contents
to
this
effect
she
announced
to
them
her
marriage
with
the
lord
warden
who
was
returned
into
scotland
with
every
power
for
the
final
subjugation
of
the
country
and
therefore
she
besought
the
regent
and
his
council
not
to
raise
a
hostile
arm
against
him
if
they
would
not
merely
escape
the
indignation
of
a
great
king
but
insure
his
favor
she
cast
out
hints
to
badenoch
as
if
edward
meant
to
reward
his
acquiescence
with
the
crown
of
scotland
and
with
similar
baits
proportioned
to
the
views
of
all
her
other
kinsmen
she
smoothed
their
anger
against
that
monarch
former
insults
persuading
them
to
at
least
remain
inactive
during
the
last
struggle
of
their
country
meanwhile
wallace
taking
his
course
along
the
banks
of
the
forth
when
the
night
drew
near
encamped
his
little
army
at
the
base
of
the
craigs
east
of
edinburgh
castle
his
march
having
been
long
and
rapid
the
men
were
much
fatigued
and
hardly
were
laid
upon
their
heather
beds
before
they
fell
asleep
wallace
had
learned
from
his
scouts
that
the
main
body
of
the
southrons
had
approached
within
a
few
miles
of
dalkeith
thither
he
hoped
to
go
next
morning
and
there
he
trusted
strike
the
conclusive
blow
for
scotland
by
the
destruction
of
a
division
which
he
understood
comprised
the
flower
of
the
english
army
with
these
expectations
he
gladly
saw
his
troops
lying
in
that
repose
which
would
rebrace
their
strength
for
the
combat
and
as
the
hours
of
night
stole
on
while
his
possessed
mind
waked
for
all
around
he
was
pleased
to
see
his
edwin
sink
down
in
a
profound
sleep
it
was
wallace
custom
once
at
least
in
the
night
to
go
himself
the
rounds
of
his
posts
to
see
that
all
was
safe
the
air
was
serene
and
he
walked
out
on
this
duty
he
passed
from
line
to
line
from
station
to
station
and
all
was
in
order
one
post
alone
remained
to
be
visited
and
that
was
a
point
of
observation
on
the
craigs
near
arthur
seat
as
he
proceeded
along
a
lonely
defile
between
the
rocks
which
overhang
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
he
was
startled
by
the
indistinct
sight
of
a
figure
amongst
the
rolling
vapors
of
the
night
seated
on
a
towering
cliff
directly
in
the
way
he
was
to
go
the
broad
light
of
the
moon
breaking
from
behind
the
clouds
shone
full
upon
the
spot
and
discovered
a
majestic
form
in
gray
robes
leaning
on
a
harp
while
his
face
mournfully
gazing
upward
was
rendered
venerable
by
a
long
white
beard
that
mingled
with
the
floating
mist
wallace
paused
and
stopping
some
distance
from
this
extraordinary
apparition
looked
on
it
in
silence
the
strings
of
the
harp
seemed
softly
touched
but
it
was
only
the
sighing
of
a
transitory
breeze
passing
over
them
the
vibration
ceased
but
in
the
next
moment
the
hand
of
the
master
indeed
struck
the
chords
and
with
so
full
and
melancholy
a
sound
that
wallace
for
a
few
minutes
was
riveted
to
the
ground
then
moving
forward
with
a
breathless
caution
not
to
disturb
the
nocturnal
bard
he
gently
approached
he
was
however
descried
the
venerable
figure
clasped
his
hands
and
in
a
voice
of
mournful
solemnity
exclaimed
art
thou
come
doomed
of
heaven
to
hear
thy
sad
coronach
wallace
started
at
this
salutation
the
bard
with
the

emotion
continued

the
awful
pause
thus
addresses

whom

other
warrior

saw
the
misty
rocks
alone
and
was
left
in
awful
solitude
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
in
profound
silence
his
very
soul
seemed
deprived
of
power
to
answer
so
terrible
a
denunciation
with
even
a
questioning
thought
he
had
heard
the
destruction
of
scotland
declared
and
himself
sentenced
to
perish
if
he
did
not

ruin

did
not

had
heard

recovering
from
the
first
shock
of
such
a
doom
and
remembering
that
it
still
left
the
choice
to
himself
between
dishonored
life
or
glorious
death
he
resolved
to
show
his
respect
to
the
oracle
by
manifesting
a
persevering
obedience
to
the
eternal
voice
which
gave
those
agents
utterance
and
while
he
bowed
to
the
warning
he
vowed
to
be
the
last
who
should
fall
from
the
side
of
his
devoted
country

devoted

he

army
in
order
for
the
new
battle
near
a
convent
of
cistercian
monks
on
the
narrow
plain
of
dalkeith
the
two
rivers
eske
flowing
on
each
side
of
the
little
phalanx
formed
a
temporary
barrier
between
it
and
the
pressing
legions
of
de
warenne
the
earl
troops
seemed
countless
while
the
southron
lords
who
led
them
on
being
elated
by
the
representations
which
the
countess
of
strathearn
had
given
to
them
of
the
disunited
state
of
the
scottish
army
and
the
consequent
dismay
which
had
seized
their
hitherto
commander
bore
down
upon
the
scots
with
an
impetuosity
which
threatened
their
universal
destruction
deceived
by
the
blandishing
falsehoods
of
his
bride
de
warenne
had
entirely
changed
his
former
opinion
of
his
brave
opponent
and
by
her
sophistries
having
brought
his
mind
to
adopt
stratagems
of
intimidation
unworthy
of
his
nobleness
so
contagious
is
baseness
in
too
fond
a
contact
with
the
unprincipled
he
placed
himself
on
an
adjoining
height
intending
from
that
commanding
post
to
dispense
his
orders
and
behold
his
victory
soldiers
cried
he
the
rebel
hour
is
come
the
sentence
of
heaven
is
gone
forth
against
him
charge
resolutely
and
he
and
his
host
are
yours
the
sky
was
obscured
an
awful
stillness
reigned
through
the
air
and
the
spirits
of
the
mighty
dead
seemed
leaning
from
the
clouds
to
witness
this
last
struggle
of
their
sons
fate
did
indeed
hover
over
the
opposing
armies
she
descended
on
the
head
of
wallace
and
dictated
from
amidst
his
waving
plumes
she
pointed
his
spear
she
wielded
his
flaming
sword
she
charged
with
him
in
the
dreadful
shock
of
battle
de
warenne
saw
his
foremost
thousands
fall
he
heard
the
shouts
of
the
scots
the
cries
of
his
men
and
the
plains
of
stirling
rose
to
his
remembrance
he
hastily
ordered
the
knights
around
him
to
bear
his
wife
from
the
field
and
descending
the
field
to
lead
forward
himself
was
met
and
almost
overwhelmed
by
his
flying
troops
horses
without
riders
men
without
shield
or
sword
but
all
in
dismay
rushed
past
him
he
called
to
them
he
waved
the
royal
standard
he
urged
he
reproached
he
rallied
and
led
them
back
again
the
fight
recommenced
long
and
bloody
was
the
conflict
de
warenne
fought
for
conquest
and
to
recover
a
lost
reputation
wallace
contended
for
his
country
and
to
show
himself
always
worthy
of
her
latest
blessing
before
he
should
go
hence
and
be
no
more
seen
the
issue
declared
for
scotland
but
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
slain
and
wallace
chased
a
wounded
foe
with
troops
which
dropped
as
they
pursued
at
sight
of
the
melancholy
state
of
his
intrepid
soldiers
he
tried
to
check
their
ardor
but
in
vain
it
is
for
wallace
that
we
conquer
cried
they
and
we
die
or
prove
him
the
only
captain
in
this
ungrateful
country
night
compelled
them
to
halt
and
while
they
rested
on
their
arms
wallace
was
satisfied
that
he
had
destroyed
the
power
of
de
warenne
as
he
leaned
on
his
sword
and
stood
with
edwin
near
the
over
which
that
youthful
hero
kept
a
guard
he
contemplated
with
generous
forbearance
the
terrified
southrons
as
they
fled
precipitately
by
the
foot
of
the
hill
toward
the
tweed
wallace
now
told
his
friend
the
history
of
his
adventure
with
the
seer
of
the
craigs
and
finding
within
himself
how
much
the
brightness
of
true
religion
excludes
the
glooms
of
superstition
he
added
the
proof
of
the
divine
spirit
in
prophecy
is
its
completion
hence
let
the
false
seer
i
met
last
night
warn
you
my
edwin
by
my
example
how
you
give
credit
to
any
prediction
that
might
slacken
the
sinews
of
duty
god
can
speak
but
one
language
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
repent
neither
a
mortal
that
he
should
change
his
purpose
this
prophet
of
baal
beguiled
me
into
a
credence
of
his
denunciation
but
not
to
adopt
the
conduct
his
offered
alternative
would
have
persuaded
me
to
pursue
i
now
see
that
he
was
a
traitor
in
both
and
henceforth
shall
read
my
fate
in
the
oracles
of
god
alone
obeying
them
my
edwin
we
need
not
fear
the
curses
of
our
enemy
nor
the
lying
of
suborned
soothsayers
the
splendor
of
this
victory
struck
to
the
souls
of
the
council
at
stirling
but
with
no
touch
of
remorse
scotland
being
again
rescued
from
the
vengeance
of
her
implacable
foe
the
disaffected
lords
in
the
citadel
affected
to
spurn
at
her
preservation
declaring
to
the
regent
that
they
would
rather
bear
the
yoke
of
the
veriest
tyrant
in
the
world
than
owe
a
moment
of
freedom
to
the
man
who
they
pretended
to
believe
had
conspired
against
their
lives
and
they
had
a
weighty
reason
for
this
decision
though
de
warenne
was
beaten
his
wife
was
a
victor
she
had
made
edward
triumphant
in
the
venal
hearts
of
her
kinsmen
gold
and
her
persuasions
with
promises
of
future
honors
from
the
king
of
england
had
sealed
them
entirely
his
all
but
the
regent
was
ready
to
commit
everything
into
the
hands
of
edward
the
rising
favor
of
these
other
lords
with
the
court
of
england
induced
him
to
recollect
that
he
might
rule
as
the
unrivaled
friend
of
bruce
should
that
prince
live
or
in
case
of
his
death
he
might
have
it
in
his
own
power
to
assume
the
scottish
throne
untrammeled
these
thoughts
made
him
fluctuate
and
his
country
found
him
as
undetermined
in
treason
as
unstable
in
fidelity
immediately
on
the
victory
at
dalkeith
kirkpatrick
eager
to
be
the
first
communicator
of
such
welcome
news
to
lennox
who
had
planted
himself
as
a
watch
at
stirling
withdrew
secretly
from
wallace
camp
and
hoping
to
move
the
gratitude
of
the
refractory
lords
entered
full
of
honest
joy
into
the
midst
of
their
council
he
proclaimed
the
success
of
his
commander
his
answer
was
accusations
and
insults
all
that
had
been
charged
against
the
wallace
was
with
added
acrimony
treachery
to
the
state
hypocrisy
in
morals
fanaticism
in
religion
no
stigma
was
too
extravagant
too
contradictory
to
be
affixed
to
his
name
they
who
had
been
hurt
in
the
fray
in
the
hall
pointed
to
their
still
smarting
wounds
and
called
upon
lennox
to
say
if
they
did
not
plead
against
so
dangerous
a
man
dangerous
to
your
crimes
and
ruinous
to
your
ambition
cried
kirkpatrick
for
so
help
me
god
i
believe
that
an
honester
man
than
william
wallace
lives
not
in
scotland
and
that
ye
know
and
his
virtues
overtopping
your
littleness
ye
would
uproot
the
greatness
which
ye
can
not
equal
this
speech
which
a
burst
of
indignation
had
wrested
from
him
brought
down
the
wrath
of
the
whole
party
upon
himself
lord
athol
yet
stung
with
his
old
wound
furiously
struck
him
kirkpatrick
drew
his
sword
and
the
two
chiefs
commenced
a
furious
combat
each
determined
on
the
extirpation
of
the
other
gasping
with
almost
the
last
breathings
of
life
neither
could
be
torn
from
their
desperate
revenge
till
many
were
hurt
in
attempting
to
separate
them
and
then
the
two
were
carried
off
insensible
and
covered
with
wounds
when
this
sad
news
was
transmitted
to
sir
william
wallace
it
found
him
on
the
banks
of
the
eske
just
returned
from
the
citadel
of
berwick
where
once
more
master
of
that
fortress
he
had
dictated
the
terms
of
a
conqueror
and
a
patriot
in
the
scene
of
his
former
victories
the
romantic
shades
of
hawthorndean
he
now
pitched
his
triumphant
camp
and
from
its
verdant
bounds
dispatched
the
requisite
orders
to
the
garrisoned
castles
on
the
borders
while
employed
in
this
duty
his
heart
was
wrung
by
an
account
of
the
storm
in
the
citadel
of
stirling
but
as
some
equivalent
the
chieftains
of
poured
in
on
him
on
every
side
and
acknowledging
him
their
protector
he
again
found
himself
the
idol
of
gratitude
and
the
almost
deified
object
of
trust
at
such
a
moment
when
the
one
voice
they
were
disclaiming
all
participation
in
the
insurgent
proceedings
at
stirling
another
messenger
arrived
from
lord
lennox
to
conjure
him
if
he
would
avoid
open
violence
or
secret
treachery
to
march
his
victorious
troops
immediately
to
that
city
and
seize
the
assembled
at
once
as
traitors
to
their
country
resume
the
regency
added
he
which
you
only
know
how
to
conduct
and
crush
a
treason
which
increasing
hourly
now
walks
openly
in
the
day
threatening
all
that
is
virtuous
or
faithful
to
you
which
means
the
great
lords
was
a
title
of
given
to
the
higher
order
of
chiefs
he
did
not
hesitate
to
decide
against
this
counsel
for
in
following
it
it
could
not
be
one
adversary
he
must
strike
but
thousands
i
am
only
a
brother
to
my
countrymen
said
he
to
himself
and
have
no
right
to
force
them
to
their
duty
when
their
king
appears
then
these
rebellious
heads
may
be
made
to
bow
while
he
mused
upon
the
letter
of
lennox
ruthven
entered
the
recess
of
the
tent
whither
he
had
retired
to
read
it
i
bring
you
better
news
of
our
friends
at
huntingtower
cried
the
good
lord
here
is
a
packet
from
douglas
and
another
from
my
wife
wallace
gladly
read
them
and
found
that
bruce
was
relieved
from
his
delirium
but
so
weak
that
his
friends
dared
not
hazard
a
relapse
by
imparting
to
him
any
idea
of
the
proceedings
at
stirling
all
he
knew
was
that
wallace
was
victorious
in
arms
and
panting
for
his
recovery
to
render
such
success
really
beneficial
to
his
country
helen
and
isabella
with
the
sage
of
ercildown
were
the
prince
unwearied
attendants
and
though
his
life
was
yet
in
extreme
peril
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
their
attentions
and
his
own
constitution
would
finally
cure
the
wound
and
conquer
its
attendant
fever
comforted
with
these
tidings
wallace
declared
his
intentions
of
visiting
his
suffering
friend
as
soon
as
he
could
establish
any
principle
in
the
minds
of
his
followers
to
induce
them
to
bear
even
for
a
little
time
with
the
insolence
of
the
abthanes
i
will
then
said
he
watch
by
the
side
of
our
beloved
bruce
till
his
recovered
health
allows
him
to
proclaim
himself
king
and
with
that
act
i
trust
all
these
feuds
will
be
forever
laid
to
sleep
ruthven
participated
in
these
hopes
and
the
friends
returned
into
the
but
all
there
was
changed
most
of
the
lothian
chieftains
had
also
received
messages
from
their
friends
in
stirling
allegations
against
wallace
arguments
to
prove
the
policy
of
submitting
themselves
and
their
properties
to
the
protection
of
a
great
and
generous
king
though
a
foreigner
rather
than
to
risk
all
by
attaching
themselves
to
the
fortunes
of
a
private
person
who
made
their
services
the
ladder
of
his
ambition
were
the
contents
of
their
packets
and
they
had
been
sufficient
to
shake
the
easy
faith
to
which
they
were
addressed
on
the
reentrance
of
wallace
the
chieftains
stole
suspicious
glances
at
each
other
and
without
a
word
glided
severally
out
of
the
tent
chapter
lxxvi
hawthorndean
next
morning
instead
of
coming
as
usual
directly
to
their
acknowledged
protector
the
lothian
chieftains
were
seen
at
different
parts
of
the
camp
closely
conversing
in
groups
and
when
any
of
wallace
officers
approached
they
separated
or
withdrew
to
a
greater
distance
this
strange
conduct
wallace
attributed
to
its
right
source
and
thought
of
bruce
with
a
sigh
when
he
contemplated
the
variable
substance
of
these
men
minds
however
he
was
so
convinced
that
nothing
but
the
proclamation
of
bruce
and
that
prince
personal
exertions
could
preserve
his
country
from
falling
again
into
the
snare
from
which
he
had
just
snatched
it
that
he
was
preparing
to
set
out
for
perthshire
with
such
persuasions
when
ker
hastily
entered
his
tent
he
was
followed
by
the
lord
soulis
lord
buchan
and
several
other
chiefs
of
equally
hostile
intentions
soulis
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
his
errand
we
come
sir
william
wallace
by
the
command
of
the
regent
and
the
assembled
abthanes
of
scotland
to
take
these
brave
troops
which
have
performed
such
good
service
to
their
country
from
the
power
of
a
man
who
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
means
to
turn
their
arms
against
the
liberties
of
the
realm
without
a
pardon
from
the
state
without
the
signature
of
the
regent
in
contempt
of
court
which
having
found
you
guilty
of
high
treason
had
in
mercy
delayed
to
pronounce
the
sentence
on
your
crime
you
have
presumed
to
place
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
national
troops
and
to
take
to
yourself
the
merit
of
a
victory
won
by
their
prowess
alone
your
designs
are
known
and
the
authority
you
have
despised
is
now
roused
to
punish
you
are
to
accompany
us
this
day
to
stirling
we
have
brought
a
guard
of
four
thousand
men
to
compel
your
obedience
before
the
indignant
spirit
of
wallace
could
utter
the
answer
his
wrongs
dictated
bothwell
who
at
sight
of
the
regent
troops
had
hastened
to
his
general
tent
entered
followed
by
his
chieftains
were
your
guard
forty
thousand
instead
of
four
cried
he
they
should
not
force
our
commander
from
us
they
should
not
extinguish
the
glory
of
scotland
beneath
the
traitorous
devices
of
envy
and
murderous
cowardice
soulis
turned
on
him
with
eyes
of
fire
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
ay
cowardice
reiterated
bothwell
the
midnight
ravisher
the
slanderer
of
virtue
the
betrayer
of
his
country
knows
in
his
heart
that
he
fears
to
draw
aught
but
the
assassin
steel
he
dreads
the
scepter
of
honor
wallace
must
fall
that
vice
and
her
votaries
may
reign
in
scotland
a
thousand
brave
scots
lie
under
these
sods
and
a
thousand
yet
survive
who
may
share
their
graves
but
they
never
will
relinquish
their
invincible
leader
into
the
hands
of
traitors
the
clamors
of
the
citadel
of
stirling
now
resounded
through
the
tent
of
wallace
invectives
accusations
threatenings
reproaches
and
revilings
joined
in
one
turbulent
uproar
again
swords
were
drawn
and
wallace
in
attempting
to
beat
down
the
weapons
of
soulis
and
buchan
aimed
at
bothwell
heart
must
have
received
the
point
of
soulis
in
his
own
body
had
he
not
grasped
the
blade
and
wrenching
it
out
of
the
chief
hand
broke
it
into
shivers
such
be
the
fate
of
every
sword
which
scot
draws
against
scot
cried
he
put
up
your
weapons
my
friends
the
arm
of
wallace
is
not
shrunk
that
he
could
not
defend
himself
did
he
think
that
violence
were
necessary
hear
my
determination
once
and
forever
added
he
i
acknowledge
no
authority
in
scotland
but
the
laws
the
present
regent
and
his
abthanes
outrage
them
in
every
ordinance
and
i
should
indeed
be
a
traitor
to
my
country
did
i
submit
to
such
men
behests
i
shall
not
obey
their
summons
to
stirling
neither
will
i
permit
a
hostile
arm
to
be
raised
in
this
camp
against
their
delegates
unless
the
violence
begins
with
them
this
is
my
answer
uttering
these
words
he
motioned
bothwell
to
follow
him
and
left
the
tent
crossing
a
rude
which
then
lay
over
the
eske
he
met
lord
ruthven
accompanied
by
edwin
and
lord
sinclair
the
latter
came
to
inform
wallace
that
embassadors
from
edward
awaited
his
presence
at
roslyn
they
came
to
offer
peace
to
our
distracted
country
cried
sinclair
then
answered
wallace
i
shall
not
delay
going
where
i
may
hear
the
terms
horses
were
brought
and
during
their
short
ride
to
prevent
the
impassioned
representations
of
the
still
raging
bothwell
wallace
communicated
to
his
not
less
indignant
friends
the
particulars
of
the
scene
he
had
left
these
contentions
must
be
terminated
added
he
and
with
god
blessing
a
few
days
and
they
shall
be
so
heaven
grant
it
returned
sinclair
thinking
he
referred
to
the
proposed
negotiation
if
edward
offers
be
at
all
reasonable
i
would
urge
you
to
accept
them
otherwise
invasion
from
without
and
civil
commotion
within
will
probably
make
a
desert
of
poor
scotland
ruthven
interrupted
him
despair
not
my
lord
whatever
be
the
fate
of
this
embassy
let
us
remember
that
it
is
our
steadiest
friend
who
decides
and
that
his
arm
is
still
with
us
to
repel
invasion
to
chastise
treason
edwin
eyes
turned
with
a
direful
expression
upon
wallace
while
he
lowly
murmured
treason
hydra
treason
wallace
understood
him
and
answered
grievous
are
the
alternatives
my
friends
which
your
love
for
me
would
persuade
you
even
to
welcome
but
that
which
i
shall
choose
will
i
trust
indeed
lay
the
land
at
peace
or
point
its
hostilities
to
the
only
aim
against
which
a
true
scot
ought
to
direct
his
sword
at
this
crisis
being
arrived
at
the
gate
of
roslyn
wallace
regardless
of
those
ceremonials
which
often
delay
the
business
they
pretend
to
dignify
entered
at
once
into
the
hall
where
the
embassadors
sat
baron
hilton
was
one
and
le
de
spencer
father
of
the
young
and
violent
envoy
of
that
name
was
the
other
at
sight
of
the
scottish
chief
they
rose
and
the
good
baron
believing
he
came
on
a
propitious
errand
smiling
said
sir
william
wallace
it
is
your
private
ear
i
am
commanded
to
seek
while
speaking
he
looked
on
sinclair
and
the
other
lords
these
chiefs
are
as
myself
replied
wallace
but
i
will
not
impede
your
embassy
by
crossing
the
wishes
of
your
master
in
a
trifle
he
then
turned
to
his
friends
indulge
the
monarch
of
england
in
making
me
the
first
acquainted
with
that
which
can
only
be
a
message
to
the
whole
nation
the
chiefs
withdrew
and
hilton
without
further
parley
opened
the
mission
he
said
that
king
edward
more
than
ever
impressed
with
the
wondrous
military
talents
of
sir
william
wallace
and
solicitous
to
make
a
friend
of
so
heroic
an
enemy
had
sent
him
an
offer
of
grace
which
if
he
contemned
must
be
the
last
he
offered
him
a
theater
whereon
he
might
display
his
peerless
endowments
to
the
admiration
of
the
world
the
kingdom
of
ireland
with
its
yet
unreaped
fields
of
glory
and
all
the
ample
riches
of
its
abundant
provinces
should
be
his
edward
only
required
in
return
for
this
royal
gift
that
he
should
abandon
the
cause
of
scotland
swear
fealty
to
him
for
ireland
and
resign
into
his
hands
one
whom
he
had
proscribed
as
the
most
ungrateful
of
traitors
in
double
acknowledgment
for
the
latter
sacrifice
wallace
need
only
send
to
england
a
list
of
those
scottish
lords
against
whom
he
bore
resentment
and
their
fates
should
be
ordered
according
to
his
dictates
edward
concluded
his
offers
by
inviting
him
immediately
to
london
to
be
invested
with
his
new
sovereignty
and
hilton
ended
his
address
by
showing
him
the
madness
of
abiding
in
a
country
where
almost
every
chief
secretly
or
openly
carried
a
dagger
against
his
life
and
therefore
he
exhorted
him
no
longer
to
contend
for
a
nation
so
unworthy
of
freedom
that
it
bore
with
impatience
the
only
man
who
had
the
courage
to
maintain
its
independence
by
virtue
alone
wallace
replied
calmly
and
without
hesitation
to
this
message
an
honest
man
can
make
but
one
reply
as
well
might
your
sovereign
exact
of
me
to
dethrone
the
angels
of
heaven
as
to
require
me
to
subscribe
to
his
proposals
they
do
but
mock
me
and
aware
of
my
rejection
they
are
thus
delivered
to
throw
the
whole
blame
of
this
war
upon
me
edward
knows
that
as
a
knight
a
true
scot
and
a
man
i
should
dishonor
myself
to
accept
even
life
ay
or
the
lives
of
all
my
kindred
upon
these
terms
hilton
interrupted
him
by
declaring
the
sincerity
of
edward
and
contrasting
it
with
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
whom
he
had
served
he
conjured
him
with
every
persuasive
of
rhetoric
every
entreaty
dictated
by
a
mind
that
revered
the
very
firmness
he
strove
to
shake
to
relinquish
his
faithless
country
and
become
the
friend
of
a
king
ready
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
wallace
shook
his
head
and
with
an
incredulous
smile
which
spoke
his
thoughts
of
edward
while
his
eyes
beamed
kindness
upon
hilton
he
answered
can
the
man
who
would
bribe
me
to
betray
a
friend
be
faithful
in
friendship
but
that
is
not
the
weight
with
me
i
was
not
brought
up
in
those
schools
my
good
baron
which
teach
that
sound
policy
or
true
can
be
separated
from
virtue
when
i
was
a
boy
my
father
often
repeated
to
me
this
proverb
dico
tibi
verum
honestas
optima
rerum
nunquam
servili
sub
nexu
vivitur
fili
this
saying
of
the
parental
teacher
of
wallace
is
recorded
it
means
know
of
a
certainty
that
virtue
the
best
of
possessions
never
can
exist
under
the
bond
of
servility
i
learned
it
then
i
have
since
made
it
the
standard
of
my
actions
and
i
answer
your
monarch
in
a
word
were
all
my
countrymen
to
resign
their
claims
to
the
liberty
which
is
their
right
i
alone
would
declare
the
independence
of
my
country
and
by
god
assistance
while
i
live
acknowledge
no
other
master
than
the
laws
of
david
and
the
legitimate
heir
of
his
blood
the
glow
of
resolute
patriotism
which
overspread
his
countenance
while
he
spoke
was
reflected
by
a
fluctuating
color
on
that
of
hilton
noble
chief
cried
he
i
admire
while
i
regret
i
revere
the
virtue
which
i
am
even
now
constrained
to
denounce
these
principles
bravest
of
men
might
have
suited
the
simple
ages
of
greece
and
rome
a
phocion
or
a
fabricius
might
have
uttered
the
like
and
compelled
the
homage
of
their
enemies
but
in
these
days
such
magnanimity
is
considered
frenzy
and
ruin
is
its
consequence
and
shall
a
christian
cried
wallace
reddening
with
the
flush
of
honest
shame
deem
the
virtue
which
even
heathens
practiced
with
veneration
of
too
pure
a
nature
to
be
exercised
by
men
taught
by
christ
himself
there
is
blasphemy
in
the
idea
and
i
can
hear
no
more
hilton
in
confusion
excused
his
argument
by
declaring
that
it
proceeded
from
his
observations
on
the
conduct
of
men
and
shall
we
replied
wallace
follow
a
multitude
to
do
evil
i
act
to
one
being
alone
edward
must
acknowledge
his
supremacy
and
by
that
know
that
my
soul
is
above
all
price
am
i
answered
said
hilton
and
then
hastily
interrupting
himself
he
added
in
a
voice
even
of
supplication
your
fate
rests
on
your
reply
oh
noblest
of
warriors
consider
only
for
the
day
not
for
a
moment
said
wallace
i
am
sensible
of
your
kindness
but
my
answer
to
edward
has
been
pronounced
baron
hilton
turned
sorrowfully
away
and
le
de
spencer
rose
sir
william
wallace
my
part
of
the
embassy
must
be
delivered
to
you
in
the
assembly
of
your
chieftains
in
the
congregation
of
my
camp
returned
he
and
opening
the
door
of
the
in
which
his
friends
stood
he
sent
edwin
to
summon
his
chiefs
to
the
platform
before
the
council
tent
chapter
lxxvii
wallace
tent
when
wallace
approached
his
tent
he
found
not
only
the
captains
of
his
own
army
but
the
followers
of
soulis
and
the
chieftains
of
lothian
he
looked
on
this
range
of
his
enemies
with
a
fearless
eye
and
passing
through
the
crowd
took
his
station
beside
the
embassadors
on
the
platform
of
the
tent
the
venerable
hilton
turned
away
with
tears
on
his
veteran
cheeks
as
the
chief
advanced
and
le
de
spencer
came
forward
to
speak
wallace
with
a
dignified
action
requested
his
leave
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
addressing
the
congregated
warriors
unfolded
to
them
the
offer
of
edward
to
him
and
his
reply
and
now
added
he
the
embassador
of
england
is
at
liberty
to
declare
his
master
alternative
le
de
spencer
again
advanced
but
the
acclamations
with
which
the
followers
of
wallace
acknowledged
the
nobleness
of
his
answer
excited
such
an
opposite
clamor
on
the
side
of
the
soulis
party
that
le
de
spencer
was
obliged
to
mount
a
war
carriage
which
stood
near
and
to
vociferate
long
and
loudly
for
silence
before
he
could
be
heard
but
the
first
words
which
caught
the
ears
of
his
audience
acted
like
a
spell
and
seemed
to
hold
them
in
breathless
attention
since
sir
william
wallace
rejects
the
grace
of
his
liege
lord
edward
king
of
england
offered
to
him
this
once
and
never
to
be
again
repeated
thus
saith
the
king
in
his
clemency
to
the
earls
barons
knights
and
commonalty
of
scotland
to
every
one
of
them
chief
and
vassal
excepting
the
aforesaid
incorrigible
rebel
he
the
royal
edward
grants
an
amnesty
of
all
their
past
treasons
against
his
sacred
person
and
rule
provided
that
within
hours
after
they
hear
the
words
of
this
proclamation
they
acknowledge
their
disloyalty
with
repentance
and
laying
down
their
arms
swear
eternal
fealty
to
their
only
lawful
ruler
edward
the
lord
of
the
whole
island
from
sea
to
sea
le
de
spencer
then
proclaimed
the
king
of
england
to
be
now
on
the
borders
with
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
ready
to
march
with
fire
and
sword
into
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
and
put
to
the
rack
all
of
every
sex
age
and
condition
who
should
venture
to
dispute
his
rights
yield
added
he
while
you
may
yet
not
only
grasp
the
mercy
extended
to
you
but
the
rewards
and
the
honors
he
is
ready
to
bestow
adhere
to
that
unhappy
man
and
by
sunset
your
offended
king
will
be
on
these
hills
and
mercy
shall
be
no
more
death
is
the
doom
of
sir
william
wallace
and
a
similar
fate
to
every
scot
who
after
this
hour
dares
to
give
him
food
shelter
or
succor
he
is
the
prisoner
of
king
edward
and
thus
i
demand
him
at
your
hands
wallace
spoke
not
but
with
an
unmoved
countenance
looked
around
upon
the
assembly
edwin
precipitated
himself
into
his
arms
full
soul
then
forced
utterance
from
his
laboring
breast
tell
your
sovereign
cried
he
that
he
mistakes
we
are
the
conquerors
who
ought
to
dictate
terms
of
peace
wallace
is
our
invincible
leader
our
redeemer
from
slavery
the
earthly
hope
in
whom
we
trust
and
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
men
nor
devils
to
bribe
us
to
betray
our
benefactor
away
to
your
king
and
tell
him
that
andrew
murray
and
every
honest
scot
is
ready
to
live
or
to
die
by
the
side
of
sir
william
wallace
and
by
this
good
sword
i
swear
the
same
cried
ruthven
and
so
do
i
rejoined
scrymgeour
or
may
the
standard
of
scotland
be
my
or
may
the
clyde
swallow
us
up
quick
exclaimed
lockhart
of
lee
shaking
his
mailed
hand
at
the
embassadors
but
not
another
chief
spoke
for
wallace
even
sinclair
was
intimidated
and
like
others
who
wished
him
well
he
feared
to
utter
his
sentiments
but
most
oh
shame
to
scotland
and
to
man
cast
up
their
bonnets
and
cried
aloud
long
live
kind
edward
the
only
legitimate
lord
of
scotland
at
this
outcry
which
was
echoed
even
by
some
in
whom
he
had
confided
while
it
pealed
around
him
like
a
burst
of
thunder
wallace
threw
out
his
arms
as
if
he
would
yet
protect
scotland
from
herself
oh
desolate
people
exclaimed
he
in
a
voice
of
piercing
woe
too
credulous
of
fair
speeches
and
not
aware
of
the
calamities
which
are
coming
upon
you
call
to
remembrance
the
miseries
you
have
suffered
and
start
before
it
be
too
late
from
this
last
snare
of
your
oppressor
have
i
yet
to
tell
ye
that
his
embrace
is
death
oh
look
yet
to
heaven
and
ye
shall
find
a
rescue
bruce
seemed
to
rise
at
that
moment
in
pale
but
gallant
apparition
before
his
soul
speech
is
almost
verbatim
from
one
of
our
old
historians
seize
that
rebellious
man
cried
soulis
to
his
marshals
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
england
i
command
you
and
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
kings
i
denounce
death
on
him
who
attempts
it
exclaimed
bothwell
throwing
himself
between
wallace
and
the
men
put
forth
a
hostile
hand
toward
him
and
this
bugle
shall
call
a
thousand
resolute
swords
to
lay
this
platform
in
blood
soulis
followed
by
his
knights
pressed
forward
to
execute
his
treason
himself
scrymgeour
ruthven
lockhart
and
ker
rushed
before
their
friend
edwin
starting
forward
drew
his
sword
and
the
clash
of
steel
was
heard
bothwell
and
soulis
grappled
together
the
falchion
of
ruthven
gleamed
amidst
a
hundred
swords
and
blood
flowed
around
the
voice
the
arm
of
wallace
in
vain
sought
to
enforce
peace
he
was
not
heard
he
was
not
felt
in
the
dreadful
warfare
ker
fell
with
a
gasp
at
his
feet
and
breathed
no
more
at
such
a
sight
the
wallace
wrung
his
hands
and
exclaimed
in
bitter
anguish
oh
my
country
was
it
for
these
horrors
that
my
marion
died
that
i
became
a
homeless
wretch
and
passed
my
days
and
nights
in
fields
of
carnage
venerable
mar
dear
and
valiant
graham
is
this
the
consummation
for
which
you
fell
at
that
moment
bothwell
having
disabled
soulis
would
have
blown
his
bugle
to
call
up
his
men
to
a
general
conflict
but
wallace
snatched
the
horn
from
his
hand
and
springing
upon
the
very
which
le
de
spencer
had
proclaimed
edward
embassy
he
drew
forth
his
sword
and
stretching
the
mighty
arm
that
held
it
over
the
throng
with
more
than
mortal
energy
he
exclaimed
peace
men
of
scotland
and
for
the
last
time
hear
the
voice
of
william
wallace
a
dead
silence
immediately
ensued
and
he
proceeded
if
you
have
aught
of
nobleness
within
ye
if
a
delusion
more
fell
than
witchcraft
have
not
blinded
your
senses
look
beyond
this
field
of
horror
and
behold
your
country
free
edward
in
these
apparent
demands
sues
for
peace
did
we
not
drive
his
armies
into
the
sea
and
were
we
resolved
he
never
could
cross
our
borders
more
what
is
it
then
you
do
when
you
again
put
your
necks
under
his
yoke
did
he
not
seek
to
bribe
me
to
betray
you
and
yet
when
i
refuse
to
purchase
life
and
the
world
rewards
in
such
baseness
you
you
forget
that
you
are
scots
that
you
are
the
victors
and
he
the
vanquished
and
you
give
not
sell
your
birthright
to
the
demands
of
a
tyrant
you
yield
yourselves
to
his
extortions
his
oppressions
his
revenge
think
not
he
will
spare
the
people
he
would
have
sold
to
purchase
his
bitterest
enemy
or
allow
them
to
live
unmanacled
who
possess
the
power
of
resistance
on
the
day
in
which
you
are
in
his
hands
you
will
feel
that
you
have
exchanged
honor
for
disgrace
liberty
for
bondage
life
for
death
me
you
abhor
and
may
god
in
your
extremest
hour
forget
that
injustice
and
pardon
the
faithful
blood
you
have
shed
this
day
i
draw
this
sword
for
you
no
more
but
there
yet
lives
a
prince
a
descendant
of
the
royal
heroes
of
scotland
whom
providence
may
conduct
to
be
your
preserver
reject
the
proposals
of
edward
dare
to
defend
the
freedom
you
now
possess
and
that
prince
will
soon
appear
to
crown
your
patriotism
with
glory
and
happiness
we
acknowledge
no
prince
but
king
edward
of
england
cried
buchan
his
countenance
our
glory
his
presence
our
happiness
the
exclamation
was
reiterated
by
a
most
disgraceful
majority
on
the
ground
wallace
was
transfixed
then
cried
le
de
spencer
in
the
first
pause
of
the
tumult
to
every
man
woman
and
child
throughout
the
realm
of
scotland
excepting
sir
william
wallace
i
proclaim
in
the
name
of
king
edward
pardon
and
peace
at
these
words
several
hundred
scottish
chieftains
dropped
on
their
knees
before
le
de
spencer
and
murmured
their
vows
of
fealty
indignant
grieved
wallace
took
his
helmet
from
his
head
and
throwing
his
sword
into
the
hand

leaping
from

took
his
course
with
a
fearless
and
dignified
step
through
the
parting
ranks
of

enemies

in

by

they
would
have
made

not

as
he

had
adopted
this
manner
of
leaving
the
ground
in
hopes
if
it
were
possible
to
awaken
the
least
spark
of
honor
in
the
breasts
of
his
persecutors
to
prevent
the
bloodshed
which
must
ensue
between
his
friends
and
them
should
they
attempt
to
seize
him
edwin
and
bothwell
immediately
followed
him
but
lockhart
and
scrymgeour
remained
to
take
charge
of
the
remains
of
the
faithful
ker
and
to
observe
the
tendency
of
the
tumult
which
began
to
murmur
amongst
the
lower
orders
of
the
bystanders
chapter
lxxviii
banks
of
the
eske
a
vague
suspicion
of
the
regent
and
his
thanes
and
yet
a
pusillanimity
which
shrunk
from
supporting
that
wallace
whom
those
thanes
chose
to
abandon
carried
the
spirit
of
slavery
from
the
platform
before
the
council
tent
to
the
chieftains
who
thronged
the
ranks
of
ruthven
and
even
to
the
perversion
of
some
few
who
had
followed
the
standard
of
bothwell
the
brave
troops
of
lanark
which
the
desperate
battle
of
dalkeith
reduced
to
not
more
than
sixty
men
alone
remained
unmoved
so
catching
is
the
quailing
spirit
of
doubt
abjectness
and
fearful
submission
in
the
moment
when
the
indignant
ruthven
saw
his
perthshire
legions
rolling
off
toward
the
trumpet
of
le
de
spencer
scrymgeour
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
men
of
lanark
unfurling
the
banner
of
scotland
he
marched
with
a
steady
step
to
the
tent
of
bothwell
whither
he
did
not
doubt
that
wallace
had
retired
he
found
him
assuaging
the
impassioned
grief
of
edwin
and
striving
to
moderate
the
vehement
wrath
of
the
faithful
murray
pour
not
out
the
energy
of
your
soul
upon
these
worthless
men
said
he
leave
them
to
the
fates
they
seek
the
fates
they
have
incurred
by
the
innocent
blood
shed
this
day
the
few
brave
hearts
who
yet
remain
loyal
to
this
country
are
insufficient
to
stem
at
this
spot
the
torrent
of
corruption
retire
beyond
the
forth
my
friend
rally
all
true
scots
around
huntingtower
let
the
royal
inmate
proclaim
himself
and
at
the
foot
of
the
grampians
lock
the
gates
of
the
highlands
upon
our
enemies
from
those
bulwarks
he
will
issue
in
strength
and
scotland
may
again
be
free
free
but
never
more
honored
cried
edwin
never
more
beloved
by
me
ungrateful
treacherous
base
land
added
he
starting
on
his
feet
and
raising
his
clasped
hands
with
the
vehement
abjuration
of
an
indignant
spirit
oh
that
the
salt
sea
would
ingulf
thee
at
once
that
thy
name
and
thy
ingratitude
could
be
no
more
remembered
i
will
never
wear
a
sword
for
her
again
edwin
ejaculated
wallace
in
a
reproachful
yet
tender
tone
exhort
me
not
to
forgive
my
country
returned
he
tell
me
to
take
my
deadliest
foe
to
my
breast
to
pardon
the
assassin
who
strikes
his
steel
into
my
heart
and
i
will
obey
you
but
to
pardon
scotland
for
the
injury
she
has
done
to
you
for
the
disgrace
with
which
her
stains
this
cheek
i
never
never
can
i
abhor
these
sons
of
lucifer
think
not
noblest
of
masters
dearest
of
friends
cried
he
throwing
himself
at
wallace
feet
that
i
will
ever
shine
in
the
light
of
those
envious
stars
which
have
displayed
the
sun
no
tibi
soli
shall
henceforth
be
the
impress
on
my
shield
to
thee
alone
will
i
ever
turn
and
till
your
beams
restore
your
country
and
revive
me
the
springing
laurels
of
edwin
ruthven
shall
whither
where
they
grew
wallace
folded
him
to
his
heart
a
tear
stood
in
his
eyes
while
he
said
in
a
low
voice
if
thou
art
mine
thou
art
scotland
me
she
rejects
mysterious
heaven
wills
that
i
should
quit
my
post
but
for
thee
edwin
as
a
relic
of
the
fond
love
i
yet
bear
this
wretched
country
abide
by
her
bear
with
her
cherish
her
defend
her
for
my
sake
and
if
bruce
lives
he
will
be
to
thee
a
second
wallace
a
friend
a
brother
edwin
listened
wept
and
sobbed
but
his
heart
was
fixed
unable
to
speak
he
broke
from
his
friend
arms
and
hurried
into
an
interior
apartment
to
subdue
his
emotions
by
pouring
them
forth
to
god
ruthven
joined
in
determined
opinion
with
bothwell
that
if
ever
a
civil
war
could
be
sanctified
this
was
the
time
and
in
spite
of
all
that
wallace
could
urge
against
the
madness
of
contending
for
his
supremacy
over
a
nation
which
would
not
yield
him
obedience
still
they
remained
firm
in
their
resolution
bruce
they
hardly
dared
hope
could
recover
and
to
relinquish
the
guiding
hand
of
their
best
approved
leader
at
this
crisis
was
a
sacrifice
they
said
no
earthly
power
should
compel
them
to
make
so
far
from
it
cried
lord
bothwell
dropping
on
his
knees
and
grasping
the
cross
hilt
of
his
sword
in
both
hands
i
swear
by
the
blood
of
the
crucified
lord
of
this
ungrateful
world
that
should
bruce
die
i
will
obey
no
other
king
of
scotland
than
william
wallace
wallace
turned
ashy
pale
as
he
listened
to
this
vow
at
that
moment
scrymgeour
entered
followed
by
the
lanark
veterans
and
all
kneeling
down
repeated
the
oath
of
bothwell
then
starting
up
called
on
the
outraged
chief
by
the
unburied
corpse
of
his
murdered
ker
to
lead
them
forth
and
avenge
them
of
his
enemies
when
the
agitation
of
his
soul
would
allow
him
to
speak
to
this
faithful
group
wallace
stretched
his
hands
over
them
and
with
such
tears
as
a
father
would
shed
who
looks
on
the
children
he
is
to
behold
no
more
he
said
in
a
subdued
and
faltering
voice
god
will
avenge
our
murdered
friend
my
sword
is
sheathed
forever
may
that
holy
being
who
is
the
true
and
best
king
of
the
virtuous
always
be
present
with
you
i
feel
your
love
and
i
appreciate
it
but
bothwell
ruthven
lockhart
scrymgeour
my
faithful
lanark
followers
leave
me
awhile
to
compose
my
scattered
thoughts
let
me
pass
this
night
alone
and
you
shall
know
the
resolution
of
your
grateful
wallace
the
shades
of
evening
were
closing
in
and
the
men
of
lanark
first
obtaining
his
permission
to
keep
guard
before
the
wood
which
skirted
the
tent
respectfully
kissing
his
hand
withdrew
ruthven
called
edwin
from
the
recess
whither
he
had
retired
to
unburden
his
grief
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
it
was
the
resolution
of
his
friends
to
preserve
the
authority
of
wallace
or
to
perish
in
the
contest
the
gloom
passed
from
his
fair
brow
a
smile
of
triumph
parted
his
lips
and
he
exclaimed
all
will
be
well
again
we
shall
force
this
deluded
nation
to
recognize
her
safety
and
her
honor
while
the
determined
chiefs
held
discourse
so
congenial
with
the
wishes
of
the
youthful
knight
wallace
sat
almost
silent
he
seemed
revolving
some
momentous
idea
he
frequently
turned
his
eyes
on
the
speakers
with
a
fixed
regard
which
appeared
rather
full
of
a
grave
sorrow
than
demonstrative
of
any
sympathy
on
the
subjects
of
their
discussion
on
edwin
he
at
times
looked
with
penetrating
tenderness
and
when
the
bell
from
the
neighboring
convent
sounded
the
hour
of
rest
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
with
a
smile
which
he
wished
should
speak
of
comfort
as
well
as
of
affection
but
the
soul
spoke
more
eloquently
than
he
had
intended
his
smile
was
mournful
and
the
attempt
to
render
it
otherwise
like
a
transient
light
over
a
dark
sepulcher
only
the
more
distinctly
showed
the
gloom
and
melancholy
within
and
am
i
too
to
leave
you
said
edwin
yes
my
brother
replied
wallace
i
have
much
to
do
with
my
own
thoughts
this
night
we
separate
now
to
meet
more
gladly
hereafter
i
must
have
solitude
to
arrange
my
plans
you
shall
know
them
meanwhile
farewell
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
the
affectionate
youth
to
his
breast
and
warmly
grasping
the
hands
of
his
three
other
friends
bade
them
an
earnest
adieu
bothwell
lingered
a
moment
at
the
and
looking
back
let
your
first
plan
be
that
you
lead
us
to
lord
quarters
to
teach
the
traitor
what
it
is
to
be
a
scot
and
a
man
my
plans
shall
be
deserving
of
my
brave
colleagues
replied
wallace
and
whether
they
be
executed
on
this
or
the
other
side
of
the
forth
you
shall
find
my
bothwell
that
scotland
peace
and
the
honor
of
her
best
sons
are
the
dearest
considerations
of
your
friend
when
the
door
closed
and
wallace
was
left
alone
he
stood
for
awhile
in
the
midst
of
the
tent
listening
to
the
departing
steps
of
his
friends
when
the
last
sound
died
on
his
ear
i
shall
hear
them
no
more
cried
he
and
throwing
himself
into
a
seat
he
remained
for
an
hour
in
a
trance
of
grievous
thoughts
melancholy
remembrances
and
prospects
dire
for
scotland
pressed
upon
his
surcharged
heart
it
is
to
god
alone
i
must
confide
my
country
cried
he
his
mercy
will
pity
its
madness
and
forgive
its
deep
transgressions
my
duty
is
to
remove
the
object
of
ruin
far
from
the
power
of
any
longer
exciting
jealousy
or
awakening
zeal
with
these
words
he
took
a
pen
in
his
hand
to
write
to
bruce
he
briefly
narrated
the
events
which
compelled
him
if
he
would
avoid
the
grief
of
having
occasioned
a
civil
war
to
quit
his
country
forever
the
general
hostility
of
the
nobles
the
unresisting
acquiescence
of
the
people
in
measures
which
menaced
his
life
and
sacrificed
the
freedom
for
which
he
had
so
long
fought
convinced
him
he
said
that
his
warlike
commission
was
now
closed
he
was
summoned
by
heaven
to
exchange
the
field
for
the
cloister
and
to
the
monastery
at
chartres
he
was
now
hastening
to
dedicate
the
remainder
of
his
days
to
the
peace
of
a
future
world
he
then
exhorted
bruce
to
confide
in
the
lords
ruthven
and
bothwell
as
his
soul
would
commune
with
his
spirit
for
he
would
find
them
true
unto
death
he
counseled
him
as
the
leading
measure
to
circumvent
the
treason
of
scotland
enemies
to
go
immediately
to
kilchurn
castle
where
he
knew
resources
would
be
for
who
retired
thither
on
the
last
approach
of
de
warenne
meaning
to
call
out
his
vassals
for
that
emergency
needed
it
not
then
for
the
battle
of
dalkeith
was
fought
and
gained
before
they
could
leave
their
heights
and
the
victor
did
not
want
them
afterward
to
use
those
brave
and
men
for
his
establishment
on
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
wallace
advised
bruce
and
so
amidst
the
natural
fortresses
of
the
highlands
he
might
recover
his
health
collect
his
friends
and
openly
proclaim
himself
then
added
he
when
scotland
is
your
oqn
let
its
bulwarks
be
its
mountains
and
its
people
arms
dismantle
and
raze
to
the
ground
the
castles
of
those
base
chiefs
who
have
only
embattled
them
to
betray
and
enslave
their
country
though
intent
on
these
political
suggestions
he
ceased
not
to
remember
his
own
brave
engines
of
war
and
he
earnestly
conjured
his
prince
that
he
would
wear
the
valiant
kirkpatrick
as
a
buckler
on
his
heart
that
he
would
place
scrymgeour
with
his
lanark
veterans
and
the
faithful
grimsby
next
him
as
his
and
that
he
would
love
and
cherish
the
brave
and
tender
edwin
for
his
sake
when
my
prince
and
friend
receives
this
added
he
wallace
shall
have
bidden
an
eternal
farewell
to
scotland
but
his
heart
will
be
amidst
its
hills
my
king
and
the
friends
most
dear
to
me
will
still
be
there
the
earthly
part
of
my
beloved
wife
rests
within
its
bosom
but
i
go
to
rejoin
her
soul
to
meet
it
in
the
vigils
of
days
consecrated
wholly
to
the
blessed
being
in
whose
presence
she
rejoices
forever
this
is
no
sad
destiny
my
dear
bruce
our
almighty
captain
recalls
me
from
dividing
with
you
the
glory
of
maintaining
the
liberty
of
scotland
but
he
brings
me
closer
to
himself
i
leave
the
plains
of
gilgal
to
tread
with
his
angel
the
courts
of
my
god
mourn
not
then
my
absence
for
my
prayers
will
be
with
you
till
we
are
again
united
in
the
only
place
where
you
can
fully
know
me
as
i
am
thine
and
scotland
friend
start
not
at
the
bold
epithet
my
body
may
sink
into
the
grave
but
the
affections
of
my
immortal
spirit
are
eternal
as
its
essence
and
in
earth
or
in
heaven
i
am
ever
yours
should
the
endearing
helen
my
heart
sister
be
near
your
couch
when
you
read
this
tell
her
that
wallace
in
idea
presses
her
virgin
cheek
with
a
brother
farewell
and
from
his
inmost
soul
he
blesses
her
messages
of
respectful
adieus
he
sent
to
isabella
lady
ruthven
and
the
sage
of
ercildown
and
then
kneeling
down
in
that
posture
he
wrote
his
last
invocations
for
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
bruce
this
letter
finished
with
a
more
tranquil
mind
he
addressed
lord
ruthven
detailing
to
him
his
reasons
for
leaving
such
faithful
friends
so
clandestinely
and
after
mentioning
his
purpose
of
proceeding
to
france
he
ended
with
those
expressions
of
gratitude
which
the
worthy
chief
so
well
deserved
and
exhorting
him
to
transfer
his
public
zeal
for
him
to
the
maguanimous
and
royal
bruce
closed
the
letter
with
begging
him
for
the
sake
of
his
friend
his
king
and
his
country
to
return
immediately
with
all
his
followers
to
huntingtower
and
there
to
rally
round
their
prince
his
letter
to
scrymgeour
spoke
nearly
the
same
language
but
when
he
began
to
write
to
bothwell
to
bid
him
that
farewell
which
his
heart
foreboded
would
be
forever
in
this
world
to
part
from
this
his
steady
companion
in
arms
his
dauntless
champion
he
lost
some
of
his
composure
and
his
handwriting
testified
the
emotion
of
his
mind
how
then
was
he
shaken
when
he
addressed
the
young
and
devoted
edwin
the
brother
of
his
soul
he
dropped
the
pen
from
his
hand
at
that
moment
he
felt
all
he
was
going
to
relinquish
and
he
exclaimed
oh
scotland
my
ungrateful
country
what
is
it
you
do
is
it
thus
that
you
repay
your
most
faithful
servants
is
it
not
enough
that
the
wife
of
my
bosom
the
companion
of
my
youth
should
be
torn
from
me
by
your
enemies
but
your
hand
must
wrest
from
my
bereaved
heart
its
every
other
solace
you
snatch
from
me
my
friends
you
would
deprive
me
of
my
life
to
preserve
you
from
that
crime
i
imbitter
the
cup
of
death
i
go
far
from
the
tombs
of
my
fathers
from
the
grave
of
my
marion
where
i
have
fondly
hoped
to
rest
his
head
sunk
on
his
arm
his
heart
gave
way
under
the
pressure
of
accumulated
regrets
and
floods
of
tears
poured
from
his
eyes
deep
and
frequent
were
his
sighs
but
none
answered
him
friendship
was
far
distant
and
where
was
that
gentle
being
who
would
have
soothed
his
sorrow
on
her
bosom
she
it
was
he
lamented
dreary
dreary
solitude
cried
he
looking
around
him
with
an
aghast
perception
of
all
that
he
had
lost
how
have
i
been
mocked
for
these
three
long
years
what
is
renown
what
the
loud
acclaim
of
admiring
throngs
what
the
loud
acclaim
of
admiring
throngs
what
the
bended
knees
of
worshiping
gratefulness
but
breath
and
vapor
it
seems
to
shelter
the
mountain
top
the
blast
comes
it
rolls
from
its
sides
and
the
lonely
hill
is
left
to
all
the
storm
so
stand
i
my
marion
when
bereft
of
thee
in
weal
or
woe
thy
smiles
thy
warm
embrace
were
mine
my
head
reclined
on
that
faithful
breast
and
still
i
found
my
home
my
heaven
but
now
desolate
and
alone
ruin
is
around
me
destruction
waits
on
all
who
would
steal
one
pang
from
the
racked
heart
of
william
wallace
even
pity
is
no
more
for
me
take
me
then
o
power
of
mercy
cried
he
stretching
forth
his
hands
take
me
to
thyself
at
these
words
a
peal
of
thunder
burst
on
his
ear
and
seemed
to
roll
over
his
tent
till
passing
off
toward
the
west
it
died
away
in
long
and
solemn
reverberation
wallace
rose
from
his
knee
on
which
he
had
sunk
at
this
awful
response
to
his
adjuration
thou
callest
me
my
father
cried
he
with
a
holy
confidence
dilating
his
soul
i
go
from
the
world
to
thee
i
come
and
before
thy
altars
know
no
human
weakness
in
a
paroxysm
of
sacred
enthusiasm
he
rushed
from
the
tent
and
reckless
whither
he
went
struck
into
the
depths
of
roslyn
woods
with
the
steps
of
the
wind
he
pierced
their
remotest
thickets
he
reached
their
boundary
it
was
traversed
by
a
rapid
stream
but
that
did
not
stop
his
course
he
sprung
over
it
and
ascending
its
moonlight
bank
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
his
name
grimsby
attended
by
a
youth
stood
before
him
the
veteran
expressed
amazement
at
meeting
his
master
alone
at
this
hour
unhelmeted
and
unarmed
and
in
so
dangerous
a
direction
the
road
said
he
between
this
and
stirling
is
beset
with
your
enemies
instead
of
noticing
this
information
wallace
inquired
what
news
he
brought
from
huntingtower
the
worst
said
he
by
this
time
the
royal
bruce
is
no
more
wallace
gasped
convulsively
and
fell
against
a
tree
grimsby
paused
in
a
few
minutes
the
chief
was
able
to
speak
listen
not
to
my
groans
for
unhappy
scotland
cried
he
show
me
all
that
is
in
this
last
vial
of
wrath
grimsby
informed
him
that
bruce
being
so
far
recovered
as
to
have
left
his
sick
chamber
for
the
family
apartment
while
he
was
sitting
with
the
ladies
a
letter
was
brought
to
lady
helen
she
opened
it
read
a
few
lines
and
fell
senseless
into
the
arms
of
her
sister
bruce
snatched
the
packet
but
not
a
word
did
he
speak
till
he
had
perused
it
to
the
end
it
was
from
the
countess
strathearn
written
in
the
triumph
of
revenge
cruelly
exulting
in
what
she
termed
the
demonstration
of
wallace
guilt
congratulating
herself
on
having
been
the
primary
means
of
discovering
it
and
boasting
that
his
once
adored
scotland
now
held
him
in
such
detestation
as
to
have
doomed
him
to
die
it
was
this
denunciation
which
had
struck
to
the
soul
of
helen
and
while
the
anxious
lady
ruthven
removed
her
inanimate
form
into
another
room
bruce
read
the
barbarous
triumphs
of
this
disappointed
woman
no
power
on
earth
can
save
him
now
continued
she
your
doting
heart
must
yield
him
helen
to
another
rest
than
your
bridal
chamber
his
iron
breast
has
met
with
others
as
adamantine
as
his
own
a
hypcrite
he
feels
not
pity
he
knows
no
beat
of
human
sympathies
and
like
a
rock
he
falls
unpitied
undeplored
undeplored
by
all
but
you
lost
girl
my
noble
lord
the
princely
de
warenne
informs
me
that
william
wallace
would
be
burned
as
a
double
traitor
in
england
and
a
price
is
now
set
upon
his
head
in
scotland
hence
there
is
safety
for
him
no
more
those
his
heart
has
outraged
shall
be
avenged
and
his
cries
for
mercy
who
will
answer
no
voice
on
earth
none
dare
support
the
man
whom
friends
and
enemies
abandon
to
destruction
yes
cried
bruce
starting
from
his
seat
i
will
support
him
thou
damned
traitress
bruce
will
declare
himself
bruce
will
throw
himself
before
his
friend
and
in
his
breast
receive
every
arrow
meant
for
that
godlike
heart
yes
cried
he
glancing
on
the
terrified
looks
of
isabella
who
believed
that
his
delirium
was
returned
i
would
snatch
him
in
these
arms
from
their
murderous
flames
did
all
the
fiends
of
hell
guard
their
infernal
fire
not
a
word
more
did
he
utter
but
darting
from
the
apartment
was
soon
seen
before
the
armed
from
head
to
foot
grimsby
stood
there
to
whom
he
called
to
bring
him
a
horse
for
that
the
light
of
scotland
was
in
danger
grimsby
who
understood
by
that
term
his
beloved
master
was
in
peril
instantly
obeyed
and
bruce
as
instantly
mourning
struck
his
rowels
into
the
horse
and
was
out
of
sight
ere
grimsby
could
reach
his
stirrup
to
follow
but
that
faithful
soldier
speeded
after
him
like
the
win
and
came
in
view
of
bruce
just
as
he
was
leaping
a
chasm
in
the
mountain
path
the
horse
struck
his
heel
against
a
loose
stone
and
it
giving
way
he
fell
headlong
into
the
deep
ravine
at
the
moment
of
his
disappearance
grimsby
rushed
toward
the
spot
and
saw
the
animal
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
at
the
bottom
bruce
lay
insensible
amongst
some
bushes
which
grew
nearer
the
top
with
difficulty
the
honest
englishman
got
him
dragged
to
the
surface
of
the
hill
and
finding
all
attempts
to
recover
him
ineffectual
he
laid
him
on
his
own
beast
and
so
carried
him
slowly
back
to
the
castle
the
assiduities
of
the
sage
of
ercildown
restored
him
to
life
but
not
to
recollection
the
fever
returned
on
him
with
a
delirium
so
hopeless
of
recovery
continued
grimsby
that
the
lady
helen
who
again
seems
like
an
inspired
angel
amongst
us
has
sent
me
with
this
youth
to
implore
you
to
come
to
huntingtower
and
there
embattle
yourself
against
your
own
and
your
prince
enemies
send
me
cried
walter
hay
grasping
wallace
hand
send
me
back
to
lady
helen
and
let
me
tell
her
that
our
benefactor
the
best
guardian
of
our
country
will
not
abandon
us
should
you
depart
genius
will
go
with
you
again
she
must
sink
again
she
will
be
in
ruins
de
valence
will
regain
possession
of
my
dear
lady
and
you
will
not
be
near
to
save
her
grimsby
walter
my
friends
cried
wallace
in
an
agitated
voice
i
do
not
abandon
scotland
she
drives
me
from
her
would
she
have
allowed
me
i
would
have
borne
her
in
my
arms
until
my
latest
gasp
but
it
must
not
be
so
i
resign
her
into
the
almighty
hands
to
which
i
commit
myself
they
will
also
preserve
the
lady
helen
from
violence
i
can
not
forego
my
trust
for
the
bruce
also
if
he
live
he
will
protect
her
for
my
sake
and
should
he
died
bothwell
and
ruthven
will
cherish
her
for
their
own
but
you
will
return
with
us
to
huntingtower
cried
grimsby
disguised
in
these
peasant
garments
which
we
have
brought
for
the
purpose
you
may
pass
through
the
legions
of
the
regent
with
perfect
security
let
me
implore
you
if
not
for
your
own
sake
for
ours
pity
our
desolation
and
save
yourself
for
them
who
can
know
no
safety
when
you
are
gone
walter
clung
to
his
arm
while
uttering
this
supplication
wallace
looked
tenderly
upon
him
i
would
save
myself
and
i
will
please
god
said
he
but
by
no
means
unworthy
of
myself
i
go
but
not
under
any
disguise
openly
have
i
defended
scotland
and
openly
will
i
pass
through
her
lands
the
chalice
of
heaven
consecrated
me
the
champion
of
my
country
and
no
scot
dare
lift
a
hostile
hand
against
this
anointed
head
the
soul
of
wallace
swelled
high
but
devoutly
while
uttering
this
whither
you
go
cried
grimsby
let
me
follow
you
in
joy
or
in
sorrow
and
me
too
my
benefactor
rejoined
walter
and
when
you
look
on
us
think
not
that
scotland
is
altogether
ungrateful
my
faithful
friend
returned
he
whither
i
go
i
must
go
alone
and
as
a
proof
of
your
love
grant
me
your
obedience
this
once
rest
amongst
these
thickets
till
morning
at
sunrise
repair
to
our
camp
there
you
will
know
my
destination
but
till
bruce
proclaims
himself
at
the
head
of
the
country
armies
for
my
sake
never
reveal
to
mortal
man
that
he
who
lies
debilitated
by
sickness
at
huntingtower
is
other
than
sir
thomas
de
longueville
rest
we
can
not
replied
grimsby
but
still
we
will
obey
our
master
you
command
me
to
adhere
to
bruce
to
serve
him
till
the
hour
of
his
death
i
will
but
should
he
die
then
i
may
seek
you
and
be
again
your
faithful
servant
you
will
find
me
before
the
cross
of
christ
returned
wallace
with
saints
my
and
god
my
only
king
till
then
grimsby
farewell
walter
carry
my
fidelity
to
your
mistress
she
will
share
my
thoughts
with
the
blessed
virgin
of
heaven
for
in
all
my
prayers
shall
her
name
be
remembered
grimsby
and
walter
struck
by
the
holy
solemnity
of
his
manner
fell
on
their
knees
before
him
wallace
raised
his
hands
bless
o
father
of
light
cried
he
bless
this
unhappy
land
when
wallace
is
no
more
let
his
memory
be
lost
in
the
virtues
and
prosperity
of
robert
bruce
grimsby
sunk
on
the
earth
and
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
manly
sorrow
walter
hid
his
weeping
face
in
the
folds
of
his
master
mantle
which
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
to
the
ground
lost
in
grief
no
thought
seemed
to
exist
in
the
young
man
heart
but
the
resolution
to
live
only
for
his
persecuted
benefactor
and
to
express
this
vow
with
all
the
energy
of
determined
devotedness
he
looked
up
to
seek
the
face
of
wallace
but
wallace
had
disappeared
and
all
that
remained
to
the
breaking
hearts
of
his
faithful
servants
was
the
tartan
plaid
which
they
had
clasped
in
their
arms
chapter
lxxix
lumloch
wallace
having
turned
abruptly
away
from
his
lamenting
servants
struck
into
the
deep
defiles
of
the
pentland
hills
they
pointed
to
different
tracks
aware
that
the
determined
affection
of
some
of
his
friends
might
urge
them
to
dare
the
perils
attendant
on
his
fellowship
he
hesitated
a
moment
which
path
to
take
certainly
not
toward
huntingtower
to
bring
immediate
destruction
on
its
royal
inhabitant
nor
to
any
chieftain
of
the
highlands
to
give
rise
to
a
spirit
of
civil
warfare
neither
would
he
pursue
the
eastern
track
for
in
that
direction
as
pointing
to
france
his
friends
would
most
likely
seek
him
he
therefore
turned
his
steps
toward
the
ports
of
ayr
the
road
was
circuitous
but
it
would
soon
enough
take
him
from
the
land
of
his
fathers
from
the
country
he
must
never
see
again
as
morning
dispelled
the
shades
of
night
it
discovered
still
more
dreary
glooms
a
heavy
mist
hung
over
the
hills
and
rolled
before
him
along
the
valley
still
he
pursued
his
way
although
the
day
advanced
the
vapors
collected
into
thicker
blackness
and
floating
down
the
heights
at
last
burst
into
a
deluge
of
rain
all
around
was
darkened
by
the
descending
water
and
the
accumulating
floods
dashing
from
the
projecting
craigs
above
swelled
the
burn
in
his
path
to
a
roaring
river
wallace
stood
in
the
torrent
with
its
wild
waves
breaking
against
his
sides
the
rain
fell
on
his
uncovered
head
and
the
chilling
blast
sighed
in
his
streaming
hair
looking
around
him
he
paused
amidst
this
tumult
of
nature
must
there
be
strife
even
amongst
the
elements
to
show
that
this
is
no
longer
a
land
for
me
spirits
of
these
hills
cried
he
pour
not
thus
your
rage
on
a
banished
man
a
man
without
a
friend
without
a
home
he
started
and
smiled
at
his
own
adjuration
the
spirits
of
heaven
launch
not
this
tempest
on
a
defenseless
head
is
chance
but
affliction
shapes
all
things
to
its
own
likeness
thou
oh
my
father
would
not
suffer
any
demon
of
the
air
to
bend
thy
broken
reed
therefore
rain
on
ye
torrents
ye
are
welcome
to
william
wallace
he
can
well
breast
the
mountain
storm
who
has
stemmed
the
ingratitude
of
his
country
hills
rivers
and
vales
were
measured
by
his
solitary
steps
till
entering
on
the
heights
of
clydesdale
the
broad
river
of
his
native
glen
spread
its
endeared
waters
before
him
not
a
wave
passed
along
that
had
not
kissed
the
feet
of
some
scene
consecrated
to
his
memory
over
the
western
hills
lay
the
lands
of
his
forefathers
there
he
had
first
drawn
his
breath
there
he
imbibed
from
the
lips
of
his
revered
grandfather
now
no
more
those
lessons
of
virtue
by
which
he
had
lived
and
for
which
he
was
now
ready
to
die
far
to
the
left
stretched
the
wide
domains
of
lammington
there
his
youthful
heart
first
knew
the
pulse
of
love
there
all
nature
smiled
upon
him
for
marion
was
near
and
hope
hailed
him
from
every
sunlit
brow
onward
in
the
depths
of
the
cliffs
lay
ellerslie
the
home
of
his
heart
where
he
had
tasted
the
joys
of
paradise
but
all
there
like
that
once
blessed
place
now
lay
in
one
wide
ruin
shall
i
visit
thee
again
said
he
as
he
hurried
along
the
beetling
craigs
ellerslie
ellerslie
cried
he
is
no
hero
no
triumphant
warrior
that
approaches
receive
shelter
thy
deserted
widowed
master
i
come
my
marion
to
mourn
thee
in
thine
own
domains
he
flew
forward
he
ascended
the
cliffs
he
rushed
down
the
pathway
but
it
was
no
longer
smooth
thistles
and
underwood
obstructed
his
steps
breaking
through
them
all
he
turned
the
angle
of
the
rock
the
last
screen
between
him
and
the
view
of
his
once
beloved
home
on
this
spot
he
used
to
stand
on
moonlight
evenings
watching
the
graceful
form
of
his
marion
as
she
passed
to
and
fro
within
her
chamber
his
eyes
now
turned
instinctively
to
the
point
but
it
gazed
on
vacancy
his
home
had
disappeared
one
solitary
tower
alone
remained
standing
like
a
hermit
the
last
of
his
race
to
mourn
over
the
desolation
of
all
by
which
it
had
once
been
surrounded
not
a
human
being
now
moved
on
the
spot
which
three
years
before
was
thronged
with
his
grateful
vassals
not
a
voice
was
now
heard
where
then
sounded
the
harp
of
halbert
where
breathed
the
song
of
his
beloved
marion
death
cried
he
striking
his
breast
how
many
ways
hast
thou
to
bereave
poor
mortality
all
all
gone
my
marion
sleeps
in
bothwell
the
faithful
halbert
at
her
feet
and
my
peasantry
of
lanark
how
many
of
you
have
found
untimely
graves
in
the
bosom
of
your
vainly
rescued
country
a
few
steps
forward
and
he
stood
on
a
mound
of
moldering
fragments
heaped
over
the
pavement
of
what
had
been
the
hall
my
wife
blood
marks
the
stones
beneath
cried
he
he
flung
himself
on
the
ruins
and
a
groan
burst
from
his
heart
it
echoed
mournfully
from
the
opposite
rock
he
started
and
gazed
around
solitude
cried
he
with
a
faint
smile
naught
is
here
but
wallace
and
his
sorrow
marion
i
call
and
even
thou
dost
not
answer
me
thou
who
didst
ever
fly
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
look
on
me
love
exclaimed
he
stretching
his
arms
toward
the
sky
look
on
me
and
for
once
till
ever
cheer
thy
lonely
wallace
tears
choked
his
further
utterance
and
once
more
laying
his
head
upon
the
stones
he
wept
in
silence
till
exhausted
natured
found
repose
in
sleep
the
sun
was
gilding
the
gray
summits
of
the
ruined
tower
under
whose
shadow
he
lay
when
wallace
slowly
opened
his
eyes
looking
around
him
he
smote
his
breast
and
with
a
heavy
groan
sunk
back
upon
the
stones
in
the
silence
which
succeeded
this
burst
of
memory
he
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
near
him
and
a
sigh
he
listened
breathless
the
sigh
was
repeated
he
gently
raised
himself
on
his
hand
and
with
an
expectation
he
dared
hardly
whisper
to
himself
turned
toward
the
spot
whence
the
sound
proceeded
the
branches
of
a
that
had
been
planted
by
his
marion
shook
and
scattered
the
leaves
of
its
ungathered
flowers
upon
the
brambles
which
grew
beneath
wallace
rose
in
agitation
the
skirts
of
a
human
figure
appeared
retreating
behind
the
ruins
he
advanced
toward
it
and
beheld
edwin
ruthven
the
moment
their
eyes
met
edwin
precipitated
himself
at
his
feet
and
clinging
to
him
exclaimed
pardon
me
this
pursuit
but
we
meet
to
part
no
more
wallace
raised
him
and
strained
him
to
his
breast
in
silence
edwin
in
hardly
articulate
accents
continued
some
kind
power
checked
your
hand
when
writing
to
your
edwin
you
could
not
command
him
not
to
follow
you
you
left
the
letter
unfinished
and
thus
i
come
to
bless
you
for
not
condemning
me
to
die
of
a
broken
heart
i
did
not
write
farewell
to
thee
cried
wallace
looking
mournfully
on
him
but
i
meant
it
for
i
must
part
from
all
i
love
in
scotland
it
is
my
doom
the
country
needs
me
not
and
i
have
need
of
heaven
i
go
into
its
outcourts
at
chartres
follow
me
there
dear
boy
when
thou
hast
accomplished
thy
noble
career
on
earth
and
then
our
gray
hairs
shall
mingle
together
over
the
altar
of
the
god
of
peace
but
now
receive
the
farewell
of
thy
friend
return
to
bruce
and
be
to
him
the
dearest
representative
of
william
wallace
never
cried
edwin
thou
alone
art
my
prince
my
friend
my
brother
my
all
in
this
world
my
parents
dear
as
they
are
would
have
buried
my
youth
in
a
cloister
but
your
name
called
me
to
honor
and
to
you
in
life
or
in
death
i
dedicate
my
being
then
returned
wallace
that
honor
summons
you
to
the
side
of
the
dying
bruce
he
is
now
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
and
where
art
thou
interrupted
edwin
who
drove
thee
hence
but
enemies
who
line
these
roads
but
wretches
sent
to
betray
their
benefactor
no
my
friend
thy
fate
shall
be
my
fate
thy
woe
my
woe
we
live
or
we
die
together
the
field
the
cloister
or
the
tomb
all
shall
be
welcomed
by
edwin
ruthven
if
they
separate
him
not
from
thee
seeing
that
wallace
was
going
to
speak
and
fearful
that
it
was
to
repeat
his
commands
to
be
left
alone
he
suddenly
exclaimed
with
vehemence
father
of
men
and
angels
grant
me
thy
favor
only
as
i
am
true
to
the
vow
i
have
sworn
never
more
to
leave
the
side
of
sir
william
wallace
to
urge
the
dangers
in
which
such
a
resolution
would
expose
this
too
faithful
friend
wallace
knew
would
be
in
vain
he
read
an
invincible
determination
in
the
eye
and
gesture
of
edwin
and
therefore
yielding
to
the
demands
of
friendship
he
threw
himself
upon
his
neck
for
thy
sake
edwin
i
will
endure
yet
awhile
mankind
at
large
thy
bloom
of
honor
shall
not
be
cropped
by
my
hand
we
will
go
together
to
france
and
while
i
seek
a
probationary
quiet
in
some
of
its
remote
cities
thou
mayest
bear
the
standard
of
scotland
in
the
land
of
our
ally
against
the
proud
enemies
of
bruce
make
of
me
what
you
will
returned
edwin
only
do
not
divide
me
from
yourself
wallace
explained
to
his
friend
his
design
of
crossing
the
hills
to
ayrshire
in
some
port
of
which
he
did
not
doubt
finding
some
vessel
bound
for
france
edwin
overturned
this
plan
by
telling
him
that
in
the
moment
the
abthanes
repledged
their
secret
faith
to
england
they
sent
orders
into
ayrshire
to
watch
the
movements
of
relations
and
to
prevent
their
either
hearing
of
or
marching
to
the
assistance
of
their
wronged
kinsman
and
besides
this
no
sooner
was
it
discovered
by
the
insurgent
lords
at
roslyn
that
he
had
disappeared
from
the
camp
than
supposing
he
meant
to
appeal
to
philip
they
dispatched
expresses
all
along
the
western
and
eastern
coasts
from
the
friths
of
forth
and
clyde
to
those
of
solway
and
to
intercept
him
on
hearing
this
and
that
all
avenues
from
the
southern
parts
of
his
country
were
closed
upon
him
wallace
determined
to
try
the
north
some
bay
in
the
western
highlands
might
open
its
yet
not
ungrateful
arms
to
set
its
benefactor
free
if
not
by
a
ship
continued
edwin
a
fisher
boat
will
launch
us
from
a
country
no
longer
worthy
of
you
their
course
was
then
taken
along
the
cartlane
craigs
at
a
distance
from
villages
and
mountain
cots
which
leaning
from
their
verdant
heights
seemed
to
invite
the
traveler
to
refreshment
and
repose
though
the
sword
of
wallace
had
won
them
this
quiet
though
his
wisdom
like
the
hand
of
creation
had
spread
the
lately
barren
hills
with
beauteous
harvest
yet
had
an
ear
of
corn
been
asked
in
his
name
it
would
have
been
denied
a
price
was
set
upon
his
head
and
the
lives
of
all
who
should
succor
him
would
be
forfeited
he
who
had
given
bread
and
homes
to
thousands
was
left
to
perish
had
no
where
to
shelter
his
head
edwin
looked
anxiously
on
him
as
at
times
they
sped
silently
along
ah
thought
he
this
heroic
endurance
of
evil
is
the
true
cross
of
our
celestial
captain
let
who
will
carry
his
insignia
to
the
holy
land
here
is
the
man
who
bears
the
real
substance
that
walks
undismayed
in
the
path
of
his
sacrificed
lord
the
black
plumage
of
a
common
highland
bonnet
which
edwin
had
purchased
at
one
of
the
cottages
to
which
he
had
gone
alone
to
buy
a
few
oaten
cakes
hung
over
the
face
of
his
friend
that
face
no
longer
blazed
with
the
fire
of
generous
valor
it
was
pale
and
sad
but
whenever
he
turned
his
eyes
on
edwin
the
shades
which
seemed
to
envelop
it
disappeared
a
bright
smile
spoke
the
peaceful
consciousness
within
a
look
of
grateful
affection
expressed
his
comfort
at
having
found
in
defiance
of
every
danger
he
was
not
yet
wholly
forsaken
edwin
youthful
happy
spirit
rejoiced
in
every
glad
beam
which
shone
on
the
face
of
him
he
loved
it
awoke
felicity
in
his
breast
to
be
occasionally
near
wallace
to
share
his
confidence
with
others
had
always
filled
him
with
joy
but
now
to
be
the
only
one
on
whom
his
noble
heart
leaned
for
consolation
was
bliss
unutterable
he
trod
on
air
and
even
chid
his
beating
heart
for
a
delight
which
seemed
to
exult
when
his
friend
suffered
but
not
so
ejaculated
he
internally
to
be
with
thee
is
the
delight
in
life
or
in
death
thy
presence
is
the
sunshine
of
my
soul
when
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
high
towers
of
bothwell
castle
wallace
stopped
we
must
not
go
thither
said
edwin
replying
to
the
sentiment
which
spoke
from
the
eyes
of
his
friend
the
servants
of
my
cousin
andrew
may
not
be
as
faithful
as
their
lord
i
will
not
try
them
returned
wallace
with
a
resigned
smile
my
presence
in
bothwell
chapel
shall
not
pluck
danger
on
the
head
of
my
dauntless
murray
she
wakes
in
heaven
for
me
whose
body
sleeps
there
and
knowing
where
to
find
the
jewel
my
friend
shall
i
linger
over
the
vacated
casket
while
he
yet
spoke
a
chieftain
on
horseback
suddenly
emerged
from
the
trees
which
led
to
the
castle
and
drew
to
their
side
edwin
was
wrapped
in
his
plaid
and
cautiously
concealing
his
face
that
no
chance
of
his
recognition
might
betray
his
companion
he
walked
briskly
on
without
once
looking
at
the
stranger
but
wallace
being
without
any
shade
over
the
noble
contour
of
a
form
which
for
majesty
and
grace
was
unequaled
in
scotland
could
not
be
mistaken
he
too
moved
swiftly
forward
the
horseman
spurred
after
him
perceiving
himself
pursued
and
therefore
known
and
aware
that
he
must
be
overtaken
he
suddenly
stopped
edwin
drew
his
sword
and
would
have
given
it
into
the
hand
of
his
friend
but
wallace
putting
it
back
rapidly
answered
leave
my
defense
to
this
unweaponed
arm
i
would
not
use
steel
against
my
countrymen
but
none
shall
take
me
while
i
have
a
sinew
to
resist
the
chieftain
now
checked
his
horse
in
front
of
wallace
and
respectfully
raising
his
visor
discovered
sir
john
monteith
at
sight
of
him
edwin
dropped
the
point
of
his
yet
unlifted
sword
and
wallace
stepping
back
monteith
said
he
i
am
sorry
for
this
rencounter
if
you
would
be
safe
from
the
destiny
which
pursues
me
you
must
retire
immediately
and
forget
that
we
have
met
never
cried
monteith
i
know
the
ingratitude
of
an
envious
country
drives
the
bravest
of
her
champions
from
our
borders
but
i
also
know
what
belongs
to
myself
to
serve
you
at
all
hazards
and
by
conjuring
you
to
become
my
guest
in
my
castle
on
the
frith
of
clyde
i
would
demonstrate
my
grateful
sense
of
the
dangers
you
once
incurred
for
me
and
i
therefore
thank
fortune
for
this
rencounter
in
vain
wallace
expressed
his
determination
not
to
bring
peril
on
any
of
his
countrymen
by
sojourning
under
any
roof
till
he
were
far
away
from
scotland
in
vain
he
urged
to
monteith
the
outlawry
which
would
await
him
should
the
infuriated
abthanes
discover
that
he
had
given
shelter
to
the
man
whom
they
had
chosen
to
suppose
a
traitor
and
denounce
as
one
monteith
after
equally
unsuccessful
persuasion
on
his
side
at
last
said
that
he
knew
a
vessel
was
lying
at
newark
near
his
castle
in
which
wallace
might
immediately
embark
and
he
implored
him
by
past
friendship
to
allow
him
to
be
his
guide
to
its
anchorage
to
enforce
this
supplication
he
threw
himself
off
his
horse
and
with
protestations
of
a
fidelity
that
trampled
on
all
comfort
he
should
ever
know
in
his
now
degraded
country
once
i
saw
scotland
steady
champion
the
brave
douglas
rifled
from
her
shores
do
not
then
doom
me
to
a
second
grief
bitterer
than
the
first
do
not
you
yourself
drive
me
from
the
side
of
her
last
hero
ah
let
me
behold
you
companion
of
my
friend
leader
benefactor
till
the
sea
wrests
you
forever
from
my
eyes
exhausted
and
affected
wallace
gave
his
hand
to
monteith
the
tear
of
gratitude
stood
in
his
eye
he
looked
affectionately
from
monteith
to
edwin
from
edwin
to
monteith
wallace
shall
yet
live
in
the
memory
of
the
trusty
of
this
land
you
my
friend
prove
it
i
go
richly
forth
for
the
hearts
of
good
men
are
my
companions
as
they
journeyed
along
the
devious
windings
of
the
clyde
and
saw
at
a
distance
the
aspiring
turrets
of
rutherglen
edwin
pointed
to
them
and
said
from
that
church
a
few
months
ago
did
you
dictate
a
terms
to
england
and
now
that
very
england
makes
me
a
fugitive
returned
wallace
oh
not
england
interrupted
edwin
you
bow
not
to
her
it
is
blind
mad
scotland
who
thus
thrusts
her
benefactor
from
her
ah
then
my
edwin
rejoined
he
read
in
me
this
history
of
thousands
so
various
is
the
fate
of
a
people
idol
he
is
worshiped
as
a
god
cast
into
the
fire
monteith
turned
pale
at
this
conversation
and
quickening
his
steps
hurried
in
silence
past
the
opening
of
the
valley
which
presented
the
view
of
rutherglen
night
overtook
the
travelers
near
the
little
village
of
lumloch
about
two
hours
journey
from
glasgow
here
a
storm
coming
on
monteith
advised
his
friends
to
take
shelter
and
rest
as
you
object
to
implicate
others
said
he
you
may
sleep
secure
in
an
old
barn
which
at
present
has
no
ostensible
owner
i
remarked
it
while
passing
this
way
from
newark
but
i
rather
wish
you
would
forget
this
too
chary
regard
for
others
and
lodge
with
me
in
the
neighboring
cottage
wallace
was
insensible
to
the
pelting
of
the
elements
his
unsubdued
spirit
wanted
rest
for
neither
mind
nor
body
but
the
broken
voice
and
lingering
step
of
the
young
edwin
who
had
severely
sprained
his
foot
in
the
dark
penetrated
his
heart
and
notwithstanding
that
the
resolute
boy
suddenly
rallying
himself
declared
that
he
was
neither
weary
nor
in
pain
wallace
seeing
he
was
both
yielded
a
sad
consent
to
be
conducted
from
the
storm
but
not
said
he
to
the
house
we
will
go
into
the
barn
and
there
on
the
dry
earth
my
edwin
we
may
gratefully
repose
monteith
did
not
oppose
him
further
and
pushing
open
the
door
wallace
and
edwin
entered
their
conductor
soon
after
followed
with
a
light
from
the
cottage
and
pulling
down
some
heaped
straw
strewed
it
on
the
ground
for
a
bed
here
i
shall
sleep
like
a
prince
cried
edwin
throwing
himself
along
the
scattered
truss
but
not
returned
monteith
till
i
have
disengaged
you
from
your
wet
garments
and
preserved
your
arms
and
brigandine
from
the
rust
of
this
night
edwin
sunk
in
weariness
said
little
in
opposition
and
having
suffered
monteith
to
take
away
his
sword
and
to
unbrace
his
plated
vest
dropped
at
once
on
the
straw
in
a
profound
sleep
wallace
that
he
might
not
disturb
him
by
debate
yielded
to
the
request
of
monteith
and
having
resigned
his
armor
also
waved
him
a
monteith
nodded
the
same
and
closed
the
door
upon
his
victims
well
known
to
the
generals
of
king
edward
as
one
who
estimated
his
honor
as
a
mere
counter
of
traffic
sir
john
monteith
was
considered
by
them
all
as
a
hireling
fit
for
any
purpose
though
de
warenne
had
been
persuaded
to
use
unworthy
means
to
intimidate
his
great
opponent
he
would
have
shrunk
from
being
a
coadjutor
of
treachery
his
removal
from
the
of
scotland
in
consequence
of
the
wounds
he
had
received
at
dalkeith
opened
a
path
to
the
elevation
of
aymer
de
valence
and
when
he
was
named
viceroy
in
the
stead
of
de
warenne
he
told
edward
that
if
he
would
authorize
him
to
offer
an
earldom
with
adequate
estates
to
sir
john
monteith
the
old
friend
of
wallace
he
was
sure
so
rapacious
a
chieftain
would
traverse
sea
and
land
to
put
that
formidable
scot
in
the
hands
of
england
to
incline
edward
to
the
proffer
of
so
large
a
bribe
de
valence
instanced
monteith
having
volunteered
while
he
commanded
with
sir
eustace
maxwell
on
the
borders
to
betray
the
forces
under
him
to
the
english
general
the
treachery
was
accepted
and
for
its
execution
he
received
a
casket
of
uncounted
gold
some
other
proofs
of
his
devotion
to
england
were
mentioned
by
de
valence
you
mean
his
devotion
to
money
replied
the
king
and
if
that
will
make
him
ours
at
this
crisis
give
him
overflowing
coffers
but
no
earldom
though
i
must
have
the
head
of
wallace
i
would
not
have
one
of
my
peers
show
a
title
written
in
his
blood
ill
deeds
must
sometimes
be
done
but
we
do
not
emblazon
their
perpetrators
de
valence
having
received
his
credentials
sent
haliburton
a
scottish
prisoner
who
bought
his
liberty
too
dear
by
such
an
embassage
to
impart
to
sir
john
monteith
the
king
of
england
approval
monteith
was
then
castellan
of
newark
where
he
had
immured
himself
for
many
months
under
a
pretense
of
the
reopening
of
old
wounds
but
the
fact
was
his
treasons
were
connected
with
so
many
accomplices
that
he
feared
some
disgraceful
disclosure
and
therefore
kept
out
of
the
way
of
exciting
public
attention
avarice
was
his
master
passion
and
the
sudden
idea
that
there
might
be
treasure
in
the
iron
box
which
unwitting
of
such
a
thought
at
the
time
he
had
consigned
to
wallace
first
bound
him
a
sordid
slave
his
murmurs
for
having
allowed
the
box
to
leave
his
possession
gave
the
alarm
which
caused
the
disasters
at
ellerslie
and
his
own
immediate
arrest
he
was
then
sent
a
prisoner
to
cressingham
at
stirling
but
in
his
way
thither
he
made
his
escape
though
only
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
soulis
that
inhuman
chief
threatened
to
return
him
to
his
dungeons
and
to
avoid
such
a
misfortune
monteith
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
to
bring
lady
helen
from
the
priory
to
the
arms
of
this
monster
on
her
escape
soulis
would
have
wreaked
his
vengeance
on
his
vile
emissary
but
monteith
aware
of
his
design
fled
and
fled
even
into
the
danger
he
would
have
avoided
he
fell
in
with
a
party
of
roaming
southrons
who
conveyed
him
to
ayr
once
having
immolated
his
honor
he
kept
no
terms
with
conscience
arnulf
soon
understood
what
manner
of
man
was
in
his
custody
and
by
sharing
with
him
the
pleasures
of
his
table
soon
drew
from
him
every
information
respecting
the
strength
and
resources
of
his
country
his
after
history
was
a
series
of
secret
treacheries
to
scotland
and
in
return
for
them
an
accumulation
of
wealth
from
england
the
comtemplation
of
which
seemed
to
be
his
sole
enjoyment
this
new
offer
from
de
valence
was
therefore
greedily
embraced
he
happened
to
be
at
rutherglen
when
haliburton
brought
the
proposal
and
in
the
cloisters
of
its
was
its
fell
agreement
signed
he
transmitted
an
oath
to
de
valence
that
he
would
die
or
win
his
hire
and
immediately
dispatching
spies
to
the
camp
at
roslyn
as
soon
as
he
was
informed
of
wallace
disappearance
he
judged
from
the
knowledge
of
that
chief
retentive
affections
that
whithersoever
he
intended
finally
to
go
he
would
first
visit
ellerslie
and
the
tomb
of
his
wife
according
to
this
opinion
he
planted
his
emissaries
in
favorable
situations
on
the
road
and
then
proceeded
himself
to
intercept
his
victim
at
the
most
probable
places
not
finding
him
at
bothwell
he
was
issuing
forth
to
take
the
way
to
ellerslie
when
the
object
of
his
search
presented
himself
at
the
opening
of
the
wood
the
evil
plan
too
well
succeeded
triumphant
in
his
deceit
this
master
of
hypocrisy
left
the
barn
in
which
he
had
seen
wallace
and
his
young
friend
lie
down
on
that
ground
from
which
he
had
determined
they
should
never
more
rise
aware
that
the
unconquerable
soul
of
wallace
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
taken
alive
he
had
stipulated
with
de
valence
that
the
delivery
of
his
head
should
entitle
him
to
a
full
reward
from
rutherglen
to
lumloch
no
place
had
presented
itself
in
which
he
thought
he
could
so
judiciously
plant
an
ambuscade
to
surprise
the
unsuspecting
wallace
and
in
this
village
he
had
stationed
so
large
a
force
of
ruthless
savages
brought
for
the
occasion
by
haliburton
from
the
irish
island
of
rathlin
that
their
employer
had
hardly
a
doubt
of
this
night
being
the
last
of
his
friend
existence
these
rathliners
neither
knew
of
wallace
nor
his
exploits
but
the
lower
order
of
scots
however
they
might
fear
to
succor
his
distress
loved
his
person
and
felt
so
bound
to
him
by
his
actions
that
monteith
durst
not
apply
to
any
one
of
them
to
second
his
villainy
events
of
wallace
having
dictated
terms
of
peace
with
england
and
monteith
pledging
himself
to
that
country
emissary
to
betray
wallace
having
taken
place
in
this
church
are
traditionary
facts
the
hour
of
midnight
passed
and
yet
he
could
not
summon
courage
to
lead
his
men
to
their
nefarious
attack
twice
they
urged
him
before
he
arose
from
his
affected
sleep
for
sleep
he
could
not
guilt
had
murdered
sleep
and
he
lay
awake
restless
and
longing
for
the
dawn
and
yet
ere
that
dawn
the
deed
must
be
accomplished
a
cock
crew
from
the
neighboring
farm
that
is
the
sign
of
morning
and
we
have
yet
done
nothing
exclaimed
a
surly
ruffian
who
leaned
on
his
in
an
ssopposite
corner
of
the
apartment
no
it
is
the
signal
of
our
enemy
captivity
cried
monteith
follow
me
but
gently
if
ye
speak
a
word
or
a
single
target
rattle
before
ye
all
fall
upon
him
we
are
lost
it
is
a
being
of
supernatural
might
not
a
mere
man
whom
ye
go
to
encounter
he
that
first
disables
him
shall
have
a
double
reward
depend
upon
us
returned
the
sturdiest
ruffian
and
stealing
cautiously
out
of
the
cottage
the
party
advanced
with
noiseless
steps
toward
the
barn
monteith
paused
at
the
door
making
a
sign
to
his
men
to
halt
while
he
listened
he
put
his
ear
to
a
crevice
not
a
murmur
was
within
he
gently
raised
the
latch
and
setting
the
door
wide
open
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
beckoned
his
followers
without
venturing
to
draw
a
breath
they
approached
the
threshold
the
meridian
moon
shone
full
into
the
hovel
and
shed
a
broad
light
upon
their
victims
the
innocent
face
of
edwin
rested
on
the
bosom
of
his
friend
and
the
arm
of
wallace
lay
on
the
spread
straw
with
which
he
had
covered
the
tender
body
of
his
companion
so
fair
a
picture
of
mortal
friendship
was
never
before
beheld
but
the
hearts
were
blind
which
looked
on
it
and
monteith
gave
the
signal
he
retreated
out
of
the
door
while
his
men
threw
themselves
forward
to
bind
wallace
where
he
lay
but
the
first
man
in
his
eagerness
striking
his
head
against
a
joist
in
the
roof
uttered
a
fierce
oath
the
noise
roused
wallace
whose
wakeful
senses
had
rather
slumbered
than
slept
and
opening
his
eyes
he
sprung
on
his
feet
a
moment
told
him
enemies
were
around
seeing
him
rise
they
rushed
on
him
with
imprecations
his
eyes
blazed
like
two
terrible
meteors
and
with
a
sudden
motion
of
his
arm
he
seemed
to
hold
the
men
at
a
distance
while
his
figure
stood
a
tower
in
collected
might
they
paused
but
it
was
only
for
an
instant
the
sight
of
edwin
now
starting
from
his
sleep
his
aghast
countenance
while
he
felt
for
his
weapons
his
cry
when
he
recollected
they
were
gone
inspired
the
assassins
with
fresh
courage
swords
and
rattling
chains
now
flashed
before
the
eyes
of
wallace
the
pointed
steel
in
many
places
entered
his
body
while
with
part
of
a
broken
bench
which
chanced
to
lie
near
him
he
defended
himself
and
edwin
from
this
merciless
host
edwin
seeing
naught
but
the
death
of
his
friend
before
his
sight
regardless
of
himself
made
a
spring
from
his
side
and
snatched
a
dagger
from
the
belt
of
one
of
the
murderers
the
ruffian
instantly
caught
the
intrepid
boy
by
the
throat
and
in
that
horrible
clutch
would
certainly
have
deprived
him
of
life
had
not
the
lion
grasp
of
wallace
seized
the
man
in
his
arms
and
with
a
pressure
that
made
his
mouth
and
nostrils
burst
with
blood
compelled
him
to
forego
his
hold
edwin
released
wallace
dropped
his
assailant
who
staggering
a
few
paces
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
and
instantly
expired
the
conflict
now
became
doubly
desperate
edwin
dagger
twice
defended
the
breast
of
his
friend
two
of
his
assassins
he
stabbed
to
the
heart
murder
that
urchin
cried
monteith
who
seeing
from
without
the
carnage
of
his
men
feared
that
wallace
might
yet
make
his
escape
hah
cried
wallace
at
the
sound
of
monteith
voice
giving
such
an
order
then
we
are
betrayed
but
not
by
heaven
strike
one
of
you
that
angel
youth
cried
he
and
you
will
incur
damnation
he
spoke
to
the
winds
they
poured
toward
edwin
wallace
with
a
giant
strength
dispersed
them
as
they
advanced
the
beam
of
wood
fell
on
the
heads
the
breasts
of
his
assailants
himself
bleeding
at
every
pore
he
felt
not
a
smart
while
yet
he
defended
edwin
but
a
shout
was
heard
from
the
door
a
faint
cry
was
heard
at
his
side
he
looked
around
edwin
lay
extended
on
the
ground
with
an
arrow
quivering
in
his
breast
his
closing
eyes
still
looking
upward
to
his
friend
the
beam
fell
from
the
hands
of
wallace
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
him
the
dying
boy
pressed
his
hand
to
his
heart
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
bosom
wallace
moved
not
spoke
not
his
hand
was
bathed
in
the
blood
of
his
friend
but
not
a
pulse
beat
beneath
it
no
breath
warmed
the
paralyzed
chill
of
his
face
as
it
hung
over
the
motionless
lips
of
edwin
the
men
were
more
terrified
at
this
unresisting
stillness
than
at
the
invincible
prowess
of
his
arm
and
stood
gazing
on
him
in
mute
wonder
but
monteith
in
whom
the
fell
appetite
of
avarice
had
destroyed
every
perception
of
humanity
sent
in
other
ruffians
with
new
orders
to
bind
wallace
they
approached
him
with
terror
two
of
the
strongest
stealing
behind
him
and
taking
advantage
of
his
face
being
bent
upon
that
of
his
murdered
edwin
each
in
the
same
moment
seized
his
hands
as
they
griped
them
fast
the
others
advanced
eagerly
to
fasten
the
bands
he
looked
calmly
up
but
it
was
a
dreadful
calm
it
spoke
of
despair
of
the
full
completion
of
all
woe
bring
chains
cried
one
of
the
men
he
will
burst
these
thongs
you
may
bind
me
with
a
hair
said
he
i
contend
no
more
the
bonds
were
fastened
on
his
wrists
and
then
turning
toward
the
lifeless
body
of
edwin
he
raised
it
gently
in
his
arms
the
rosy
red
of
youth
yet
tinged
his
cold
cheek
his
parted
lips
still
beamed
with
the
same
but
the
breath
that
had
so
sweetly
informed
them
was
flown
oh
my
best
brother
that
ever
i
had
cried
wallace
in
a
sudden
transport
and
kissing
his
pale
forehead
my
sincerest
friend
in
my
greatest
need
in
thee
was
truth
manhood
and
nobleness
in
thee
was
all
fidelity
with
woman
tenderness
my
friend
my
brother
oh
would
to
god
i
had
died
for
thee
chapter
lxxx
huntingtower
lord
ruthven
was
yet
musing
in
fearful
anxiety
on
wallace
solemn
adieu
and
the
confirmation
which
the
recitals
of
grimsby
and
hay
had
brought
of
his
determined
exile
when
he
was
struck
with
a
new
consternation
by
the
flight
of
his
son
a
billet
which
edwin
had
left
with
scrymgeour
who
guessed
not
its
contents
told
his
father
that
he
was
gone
to
seek
their
friend
and
to
unite
himself
forever
to
his
fortunes
bothwell
not
less
eager
to
preserve
wallace
to
the
world
with
an
intent
to
persuade
him
to
at
least
abandon
his
monastic
project
set
off
direct
for
france
hoping
to
arrive
before
his
friend
and
engage
the
french
monarch
to
assist
in
preventing
so
grievous
a
sacrifice
ruthven
meanwhile
fearful
that
the
unarmed
wallace
and
the
edwin
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
venal
wretches
now
widely
dispersed
to
seize
the
chief
and
his
adherents
sent
out
the
veterans
in
divers
disguises
to
pursue
the
roads
it
was
probable
he
might
take
and
finding
him
guard
him
safely
to
the
coast
till
ruthven
should
receive
accounts
of
their
success
he
forbore
to
forward
the
letter
which
wallace
had
left
for
bruce
or
to
increase
the
solicitude
of
the
already
anxious
inhabitants
of
huntingtower
with
any
intimation
of
what
had
happened
but
on
the
fourth
day
scrymgeour
and
his
party
returned
with
the
horrible
narrative
of
lumloch
after
the
murder
of
his
youthful
friend
wallace
had
been
loaded
with
irons
and
conveyed
so
unresistingly
that
he
seemed
in
a
stupor
on
board
a
vessel
to
be
carried
without
loss
of
time
to
the
tower
of
london
sir
john
monteith
though
he
never
ventured
into
his
sight
attended
as
the
accuser
who
to
put
a
visor
on
cruelty
was
to
swear
away
his
victim
life
the
horror
and
grief
of
ruthven
at
these
tidings
were
unutterable
and
scrymgeour
to
turn
the
tide
of
the
bereaved
father
thoughts
to
the
inspiring
recollection
of
the
early
glory
of
his
son
proceeded
to
narrate
that
he
found
the
beauteous
remains
in
the
hovel
but
bedecked
with
flowers
by
the
village
girls
they
were
weeping
over
it
and
lamenting
the
pitiless
heart
which
could
slay
such
youth
and
loveliness
to
bury
him
in
so
obscure
a
spot
scrymgeour
would
not
allow
and
he
had
sent
stephen
ireland
with
the
sacred
corpse
to
dumbarton
with
orders
to
see
him
entombed
in
the
chapel
of
that
fortress
it
is
done
continued
the
worthy
knight
and
those
towers
he
so
bravely
scaled
with
stand
forever
the
monument
of
edwin

scrymgeour
said
the
stricken
father
the
shafts
fall
thick
upon
us

we
must
fulfill
our
duty
cautious
of
inflicting
too
heavy
a
blow
on
the
fortitude
of
his
wife
and
of
helen
he
commanded
grimsby
and
hay
to
withhold
from
everybody
at
huntingtower
the
tidings
of
its
young
lord
fate
but
he
believed
it
his
duty
not
to
delay
the
letter
of
wallace
to
bruce
and
the
dreadful
information
to
him
of
monteith
treachery
ruthven
ended
his
short
epistle
to

saying
he
should
soon
follow

on
grimsby
arrival
at

he
was
conducted
immediately
to
bruce
some
cheering
symptoms
having
appeared
that
morning
he
had
just
exchanged
his
bed
for
a
couch
when
grimsby
entered
the
room
the
countenance
of
the
honest
southron
was
the
harbinger
of
his
news
lady
helen
started
from
her
seat
and
bruce
stretching
out
his
arms
eagerly
caught
the
packets
the
soldier
presented
isabella
inquired
if
all
were
well
with
sir
william
wallace
but
ere
he
could
make
an
answer
lady
ruthven
ran
breathless
into
the
room
holding
out
the
open
letter
brought
by
hay
to
her
bruce
had
just
read
the
first
line
of
his
which
announced
the
captivity
of
wallace
and
with
a
groan
that
pierced
through
the
souls
of
every
one
present
he
made
an
attempt
to
spring
from
the
couch
but
in
the
act
he
reeled
and
fell
back
in
a
fearful
but
mute
mental
agony
the
apprehensive
heart
of
helen
guessed
some
direful
explanation
she
looked
with
speechless
inquiry
upon
her
aunt
and
grimsby
isabella
and
ercildown
hastened
to
bruce
and
lady
ruthven
being
too
much
appalled
in

to
think
for
a
moment
on
the
aghast
helen
hurriedly
read
to
her
from

letter
the
brief
but
decisive
account
of
wallace
dangerous
situation
his
seizure
and
conveyance
to
the
tower
of
england
helen
listened
without
a
word
her
heart
seemed
locked
within
her
her
brain
was
on
fire
and
gazing
fixedly
on
the
floor
while
she
listened
all
else
that
was
transacted
around
her
passed
unnoticed
the
pangs
of
a
convulsion
fit
did
not
long
shackle
the
determined
bruce
the
energy
of
his
spirit
struggling
to
gain
the
side
of
wallace
in
this
his
extreme
need
for
he
well
knew
edward
implacable
soul
roused
him
from
his
worse
than
swoon
with
his
extended
arms
dashing
away
the
restoratives
with
which
both

him
down

me
not

this
is
not

my

is
in
the
fangs
of
the
tyrant
and
shall
i
lie
here
no

for
all
the
empires
in
the
globe
will
i
be
detained
another
hour
isabella
affrighted
at
the
furies
which
raged
in
his
eyes
but
yet
more
terrified
at
the
perils
attendant
on
his
desperate
resolution
threw
herself
at
his
feet
and
implored
him
to
stay
for
her
sake
no
cried
bruce
not
for
thy
life
isabella
which
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
not
to
save
this
ungrateful
country
from
the
doom
it
merits
would
i
linger
one
moment
from
the
side
of
him
who
has
fought
bled
and
suffered
for
me
and
mine
who
is
now
treated
with
ignominy
and
sentenced
to
die
for
my
delinquency
had
i
consented
to
proclaim
myself
on
my
landing
secure
with
bruce
the
king
envy
would
have
feared
to
strike
but
i
must
first
win
a
fame
like
his
and
while
i
lay
here
they
tore
him
from
the
vain
and
impotent
bruce
but
almighty
pardoner
of
my
sins
cried
he
with
vehemence
grant
me
strength
to
wrest
him
from
their
grip
and
i
will
go
barefoot
to
palestine
to
utter
all
my
gratitude
isabella
sunk
weeping
into
the
arms
of
her
aunt
and
the
venerable
ercildown
wishing
to
curb
an
impetuosity
which
could
only
involve
its
generous
agent
in
a
ruin
deeper
than
that
it
sought
to
revenge
with
more
zeal
than
judgment
urged
to
the
prince
the
danger
into
which
such
boundless
resentment
would
precipitate
his
own
person
at
this
intimation
the
impassioned
bruce
stung
to
the
soul
that
such
an
argument
could
be
expected
to
have
weight
with
him
solemnly
bent
his
knees
and
clasping
his
sword
vowed
before
heaven
either
to
release
wallace
or
to
share
his
fate
he
would
have
added
but
isabella
watchful
of
his
words
suddenly
interrupted
him
by
throwing
herself
wildly
on
his
neck
and
exclaiming
oh
say
not
so
rather
swear
to
pluck
the
tyrant
from
his
throne
that
the
scepter
of
my
bruce
may
bless
england
as
it
will
yet
do
this
unhappy
land
she
says
right
ejaculated
ercildown
in
a
prophetic
transport
and
the
scepter
of
bruce
in
the
hands
of
his
offspring
shall
bless
the
united
countries
to
the
latest
generations
the
walls
of
separation
shall
then
be
thrown
down
and
england
and
scotland
be
one
people
bruce
looked
steadfastly
on
the

then
if
thy

utter

gazed
intently
on

while

she
smiled
when

she
did

there
was
a

vacancy
in
the
smile
that
seemed
to

she
knew
not
what
had
been

and
that
her

were
far
away
without

regarding

she
arose
and
left
the

at
this
moment

fearful
abstraction
her

the
approach
of
night
favored
her
design
hurrying
to
her
chamber
she
dismissed
her
maids
with
the
prompt
excuse
that
she
was
ill
and
desired
not
to
be
disturbed
until
morning
then
bolting
the
door
she
quickly
habited
herself
as
the
dear
memorial
of
her
happy
days
in
france
and
dropping
from
her
window
into
the
pleasance
beneath
ran
swiftly
through
its
woody
precincts
toward
dundee
before
she
arrived
at
the
suburbs
of
ferth
her
tender
feet
became
so
blistered
she
found
the
necessity
of
stopping
at
the
first
cottage
but
her
perturbed
spirits
rendered
it
impossible
for
her
to
take
rest
and
she
answered
the
hospitable
offer
of
its
humble
owner
with
a
request
that
he
would
go
into
the
town
and
immediately
purchase
a
horse
to
carry
her
that
night
to
dundee
she
put
her
purse
into
the
man
hand
who
without
further
discussion
obeyed
when
the
animal
was
brought
and
the
honest
scot
returned
her
the
purse
with
its
remaining
contents
she
divided
them
with
him
and
turning
from
his
thanks
mounted
the
horse
and
rode
away
about
an
hour
before
dawn
she
arrived
within
view
of
the
ships
lying
in
the
harbor
at
dundee
at
this
sight
she
threw
herself
off
the
panting
animal
and
leaving
it
to
rest
and
liberty
hastened
to
the
beach
a
gentle
breeze
blew
freshly
from
the
northwest
and
several
vessels
were
heaving
their
anchors
to
get
under
weigh
are
any
demanded
she
bound
for
the
tower
of
london
none
were
the
replies
despair
was
now
in
her
heart
and
gesture
but
suddenly
recollecting
that
in
dressing
herself
for
flight
she
had
not
taken
off
the
jewels
she
usually
wore
she
exclaimed
with
renovated
hope
will
not
gold
tempt
some
one
to
carry
me
thither
a
rough
norwegian
sailor
jumped
from
the
side
of
the
nearest
vessel
and
readily
answered
in
the
affirmative
my
life
rejoined
she
or
a
necklace
of
pearls
shall
be
yours
in
the
moment
you
land
me
at
the
tower
of
london
the
man
seeing
the
youth
and
agitation
of
the
seeming
boy
doubted
his
power
to
perform
so
magnificent
a
promise
and
was
half
inclined
to
retract
his
assent
but
helen
pointing
to
a
jewel
on
her
finger
as
a
proof
that
she
did
not
speak
of
things
beyond
her
read
he
no
longer
hesitated
and
pledging
his
word
that
wind
and
tide
in
his
favor
he
would
land
her
at
the
tower
stairs
she
as
if
all
happiness
must
meet
her
at
that
point
sprung
into
his
vessel
the
sails
were
unfurled
the
voices
of
the
men
chanted
forth
their
cheering
responses
on
clearing
the
harbor
and
helen
throwing
herself
along
the
floor
of
her
little
cabin
in
that
prostration
of
body
and
soul
silently
breathed
her
thanks
to
god
for
being
indeed
launched
on
the
ocean
whose
waves
she
trusted
would
soon
convey
her
to
wallace
to
sooth
to
serve
to
die
or
to
compass
the
release
of
him
who
had
sacrificed
more
than
his
life
for
her
father
preservation
for
him
who
had
saved
herself
from
worse
than
death
chapter
lxxxi
the
thames
on
the
evening
of
the
fourteenth
day
from
the
one
in
which
helen
had
embarked
the
little
ship
of
dundee
entered
on
the
bright
bosom
of
the
nore
while
she
sat
on
the
deck
watching
the
progress
of
the
vessel
with
an
eager
spirit
which
would
gladly
have
taken
wings
to
have
flown
to
the
object
of
her
voyage
she
first
saw
the
majestic
waters
of
the
thames
but
it
was
a
tyrannous
flood
to
her
and
she
marked
not
the
diverging
shores
crowned
with
palaces
her
eyes
looked
over
every
stately
dome
to
seek
the
black
summits
of
the
tower
at
a
certain
point
the
captain
of
the
vessel
spoke
through
his
trumpet
to
summon
a
pilot
from
the
land
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
obeyed
the
englishman
took
the
helm
helen
was
reclined
on
a
coil
of
ropes
near
him
he
entered
into
conversation
with
the
norwegian
and
she
listened
in
speechless
attention
to
a
recital
which
bound
up
her
every
sense
in
that
hearing
the
captain
had
made
some
unprincipled
jest
on
the
present
troubles
of
scotland
now
his
adopted
country
from
his
commercial
interests
and
he
added
with
a
laugh
that
he
though
any
ruler
the
right
one
who
gave
him
a
free
course
in
traffic
in
answer
to
this
remark
and
with
an
observation
not
very
flattering
to
the
norwegian
estimation
of
right
and
wrong
the
englishman
mentioned
the
capture
of
the
once
renowned
champion
of
scotland
even
the
enemy
who
recounted
the
particulars
showed
a
truth
in
the
recital
which
shamed
the
man
who
had
benefited
by
the
patriotism
he
affected
to
despise
and
for
which
sir
william
wallace
was
now
likely
to
shed
his
blood
i
was
present
continued
the
pilot
when
the
brave
scot
was
put
on
the
raft
which
carried
him
through
the
traitor
gate
into
the
tower
his
hands
and
feet
were
bound
with
iron
but
his
head
owing
to
faintness
from
the
wounds
he
had
received
at
lumloch
was
so
bent
down
on
his
breast
as
he
reclined
on
the
float
that
i
could
not
then
see
his
face
there
was
a
great
pause
for
none
of
us
when
he
did
appear
in
sight
could
shout
over
the
downfall
of
so
merciful
a
conqueror
many
were
spectators
of
this
scene
whose
lives
he
had
spared
on
the
fields
of
scotland
and
my
brother
was
amongst
them
however
that
i
might
have
a
distinct
view
of
the
man
who
has
so
long
held
our
warlike
monarch
in
dread
i
went
to
westminster
hall
on
the
day
appointed
for
his
trial
the
great
judges
of
the
land
and
almost
all
the
lords
besides
were
there
and
a
very
grand
spectacle
they
made
but
when
the
was
opened
and
the
dauntless
prisoner
appeared
then
it
was
that
i
saw
true
majesty
king
edward
on
his
throne
never
looked
with
such
a
royal
air
his
very
chains
seemed
given
to
be
graced
by
him
as
he
moved
through
the
parting
crowd
with
the
step
of
one
who
had
been
used
to
have
all
his
accusers
at
his
feet
though
pale
with
loss
of
blood
and
his
countenance
bore
traces
of
the
suffering
occasioned
by
the
state
of
his
yet
unhealed
wounds
his
head
was
now
erect
and
he
looked
with
undisturbed
dignity
on
all
around
the
earl
of
gloucester
whose
life
and
liberty
he
had
granted
at
berwick
sat
on
the
right
of
the
lord
chancellor
bishop
beck
the
lords
de
valence
and
soulis
with
one
monteith
who
it
seems
was
the
man
that
betrayed
him
into
our
hands
charged
him
with
high
treason
against
the
life
of
king
edward
and
the
peace
of
his
majesty
realms
of
england
and
scotland
grievous
were
the
accusations
brought
against
him
and
bitter
the
revilings
with
which
he
was
denounced
as
a
traitor
too
mischievous
to
deserve
any
show
of
mercy
the
earl
of
gloucester
at
last
rose
indignantly
and
in
energetic
and
respectful
terms
called
on
sir
william
wallace
by
the
reverence
in
which
he
held
the
tribunal
of
future
ages
to
answer
for
himself
this
adjuration
brave
earl
replied
he
will
speak
o
men
of
scotland
what
a
voice
was
that
in
it
was
all
honesty
and
nobleness
and
a
murmur
arose
from
some
who
feared
its
power
which
gloucester
was
obliged
to
check
by
exclaiming
aloud
with
a
stern
voice
while
sir
william
wallace
answers
he
who
disobeys
take
into
custody
a
pause
succeeded
and
the
chieftain
with
majesty
of
truth
denied
the
possibility
of
being
a
traitor
where
he
never
had
owed
allegiance
but
with
a
matchless
fearlessness
he
avowed
the
facts
alleged
against
him
which
told
the
havoc
he
had
made
of
the
english
on
the
scottish
plains
and
the
devastations
he
had
afterward
wrought
in
the
lands
of
england
was
a
son
cried
he
the
orphans
of
his
father
from
the
steel
and
rapine
of
a
treacherous
friend
it
was
the
sword
of
restitution
gathering
on
that
false
friend
fields
the
harvests
he
had
ravaged
from
theirs
he
spoke
more
and
nobly
too
nobly
for
them
who
heard
him
they
rose
to
a
man
to
silence
what
they
could
not
confute
and
the
sentence
of
death
was
pronounced
on
him
the
cruel
death
of
a
traitor
the
earl
of
gloucester
turned
pale
on
his
seat
but
the
countenance
of
wallace
was
unmoved
as
he
was
led
forth
i
followed
and
of
wallace
was
unmoved
as
he
was
led
forth
i
followed
and
saw
the
young
le
de
spencer
with
several
other
reprobate
gallants
of
our
court
ready
to
receive
him
with
shameful
mockery
they
flew
laurels
on
his
head
and
with
torrents
of
derision
told
him
it
was
meet
they
should
so
salute
the
champion
of
scotland
wallace
glanced
on
them
a
look
which
spoke
pity
rather
than
contempt
and
with
a
serene
countenance
he
followed
the
warden
toward
the
tower
the
hirelings
of
his
accusers
loaded
him
with
invectives
as
he
passed
along
but
the
populace
who
beheld
his
noble
mien
with
those
individuals
who
had
heard
of
while
many
had
felt
his
generous
virtues
deplored
and
wept
his
sentence
at
sunrise
he
dies
helen
face
being
overshadowed
by
the
low
brim
of
her
hat
the
agony
of
her
mind
could
not
have
been
read
in
her
countenance
had
the
good
southron
been
sufficiently
uninterested
in
his
story
to
regard
the
sympathy
of
others
but
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
the
last
dreadful
words
at
sunrise
he
dies
she
started
from
her
seat
her
senses
apprehended
nothing
further
and
turning
to
the
norwegian
captain
cried
she
i
must
reach
the
tower
this
night
impossible
was
the
reply
the
tide
will
not
take
us
up
till
at
noon
then
the
waves
shall
cried
she
and
frantically
rushing
toward
the
ship
side
she
would
have
thrown
herself
into
the
water
had
not
the
pilot
caught
her
arm
boy
said
he
are
you
mad
your
action
your
looks
no
interrupted
she
wringing
her
hands
but
in
the
tower
i
must
be
this
night
or
oh
god
of
mercy
end
my
misery
the
unutterable
anguish
of
her
voice
countenance
and
gesture
excited
a
suspicion
in
the
englishman
that
this
youth
was
connected
with
the
scottish
chief
and
not
choosing
to
hint
his
surmise
to
the
unfeeling
norwegian
in
a
different
tone
he
exhorted
helen
to
composure
and
offered
her
his
own
boat
which
was
then
towed
at
the
side
of
the
vessel
to
take
her
to
the
tower
helen
grasped
the
pilot
rough
hand
and
in
a
paroxysm
of
gratitude
pressed
it
to
her
lips
then
forgetful
of
her
engagements
with
the
insensible
man
who
stood
unmoved
by
his
side
sprung
into
the
boat
the
norwegian
followed
her
and
in
a
threatening
tone
demanded
his
hire
she
now
recollected
it
and
putting
her
hand
into
her
vest
gave
him
the
string
of
pearls
which
had
been
her
necklace
he
was
satisfied
and
the
boat
pushed
off
the
cross
the
cherished
memorial
of
her
hallowed
meeting
with
wallace
in
the
chapel
of
snawdoun
and
which
always
hung
suspended
on
her
bosom
was
now
in
her
hand
and
pressed
close
to
her
heart
the
rowers
plied
their
oars
and
her
eyes
with
a
gaze
as
if
they
would
pierce
the
horizon
looked
intently
onward
while
the
men
labored
through
the
tide
even
to
see
the
walls
which
contained
wallace
seemed
to
promise
her
a
degree
of
comfort
she
dared
hardly
hope
herself
to
enjoy
at
last
the
awful
battlements
of
england
state
prison
rose
before
her
she
could
not
mistake
them
that
is
the
tower
said
one
of
the
rowers
a
shriek
escaped
her
and
instantly
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
tried
to
shut
from
her
sight
those
very
walls
she
had
so
long
sought
amongst
the
clouds
they
imprisoned
wallace
he
groaned
within
their
confines
and
their
presence
paralyzed
her
heart
shall
i
die
before
i
reach
thee
wallace
was
the
question
her
almost
flitting
soul
uttered
as
she
trembling
yet
with
swift
steps
ascended
the
stone
stairs
which
led
from
the
water
edge
to
the
entrance
to
the
tower
she
flew
through
the
different
courts
to
the
one
in
which
stood
the
prison
of
wallace
one
of
the
boatmen
being
bargeman
to
the
governor
of
the
tower
as
a
privileged
person
conducted
her
unmolested
through
every
ward
till
she
reached
the
place
of
her
destination
there
she
dismissed
him
with
a
ring
from
her
finger
as
his
reward
and
passing
a
body
of
soldiers
who
kept
guard
before
a
large
porch
that
led
to
the
dungeons
she
entered
and
found
herself
in
an
immense
paved
room
a
single
sentinel
stood
at
the
end
near
to
an
iron
grating
or
small
portcullis
there
then
was
wallace
forgetting
her
disguise
and
situation
in
the
frantic
eagerness
of
her
pursuit
she
hastily
advanced
to
the
man
let
me
pass
to
sir
william
wallace
cried
she
and
treasures
shall
be
your
reward
whose
treasures
my
pretty
page
demanded
the
soldier
i
dare
not
were
it
at
the
suit
of
the
countess
of
gloucester
herself
oh
cried
helen
for
the
sake
of
a
greater
than
any
countess
in
the
land
take
this
jeweled
bracelet
and
let
me
pass
the
man
misapprehending
the
words
of
this
adjuration
at
sight
of
the
diamonds
supposing
the
page
must
come
from
the
good
queen
no
longer
demurred
putting
the
bracelet
into
his
bosom
he
whispered
helen
that
as
he
granted
this
permission
at
the
risk
of
his
life
she
must
conceal
herself
in
the
interior
chamber
of
the
prisoner
dungeon
should
any
person
from
the
warden
visit
him
during
their
interview
she
readily
promised
this
and
he
informed
her
that
when
through
this
door
she
must
cross
two
other
apartments
the
bolts
to
the
entrances
of
which
she
must
undraw
and
then
at
the
extremity
of
a
long
passage
a
door
fastened
by
a
latch
would
admit
her
to
sir
william
wallace
with
these
words
the
soldier
removed
the
massy
bars
and
helen
entered
chapter
lxxxii
the
tower
of
london
helen
fleet
steps
carried
her
in
a
few
minutes
through
the
intervening
dungeons
to
the
door
which
would
restore
to
her
eyes
the
being
with
whose
life
her
existence
seemed
blended
the
bolts
had
yielded
to
her
hands
the
iron
latch
now
gave
way
and
the
ponderous
oak
grating
dismally
on
its
hinges
she
looked
forward
and
beheld
the
object
of
all
her
solicitude
leaning
along
a
couch
a
stone
table
was
before
him
at
which
he
seemed
writing
he
raised
his
head
at
the
sound
the
peace
of
virtue
was
in
his
eyes
and
a
smile
on
his
lips
as
if
he
had
expected
some
angel
visitant
the
first
glance
at
his
pale
but
heavenly
countenance
struck
to
the
heart
of
helen
veneration
anguish
shame
all
rushed
on
her
at
once
she
was
in
his
presence
but
how
might
he
turn
from
consolations
he
had
not
sought
the
intemperate
passion
of
her
now
glared
before
her
his
contempt
of
the
countess
unsolicited
advances
appeared
ready
to
be
extended
to
her
rash
and
with
an
irrepressible
cry
which
seemed
to
breathe
out
her
life
helen
would
have
fled
but
her
failing
limbs
bent
under
her
and
she
fell
senseless
into
the
dungeon
wallace
started
from
his
reclining
position
he
thought
his
senses
must
deceive
him
and
yet
the
shriek
was
lady
helen
he
had
heard
the
same
cry
on
the
pentland
hills
in
the
chamber
of
chateau
galliard
he
rose
agitated
he
approached
the
prostrate
youth
and
bending
to
the
inanimate
form
took
off
the
norman
hat
he
parted
the
heavy
locks
which
fell
over
her
brow
and
recognized
the
features
of
her
who
alone
had
ever
shared
his
meditations
with
his
marion
he
sprinkled
water
on
her
face
and
hands
he
touched
her
cheek
it
was
ashy
cold
and
the
chill
struck
to
his
heart
helen
exclaimed
he
helen
awake
speak
to
thy
friend
still
she
was
motionless
dead
cried
he
with
increased
emotion
his
eye
and
his
heart
in
a
moment
discerned
and
understood
the
rapid
emaciation
of
those
lovely
features
now
fearing
the
worst
gone
so
soon
repeated
he
gone
to
tell
my
marion
that
her
wallace
comes
blessed
angel
cried
he
clasping
her
to
his
breast
with
an
energy
of
which
he
was
not
aware
take
me
take
me
with
thee
the
pressure
the
voice
roused
the
dormant
life
of
helen
with
a
torturing
sigh
she
unsealed
her
eyes
from
the
load
that
oppressed
them
and
found
herself
in
the
arms
of
wallace
all
her
wandering
senses
which
from
the
first
promulgation
of
his
danger
had
been
kept
in
a
bewildered
state
now
rallied
and
in
recovered
sanity
smote
her
to
the
soul
though
still
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
the
fate
which
threatened
to
tear
him
from
her
and
life
she
now
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
so
trampled
on
the
retreating
modesty
of
her
nature
as
to
have
brought
herself
thus
into
his
presence
and
in
a
voice
of
horror
of
despair
believing
that
she
had
forever
destroyed
herself
in
his
opinion
she
exclaimed
o
wallace
how
came
i
here
i
am
lost
and
innocently
but
god
the
pure
god
can
read
the
soul
she
lay
in
hopeless
misery
on
his
breast
with
her
eyes
again
closed
almost
unconscious
of
the
support
on
which
she
leaned
lady
helen
returned
he
was
it
other
than
wallace
you
sought
in
these
dungeons
i
dared
to
think
that
the
parent
we
both
adore
had
sent
you
hither
to
be
his
harbinger
of
consolation
recalled
to
by
the
kindness
of
these
words
helen
turned
her
head
on
his
bosom
and
in
a
burst
of
grateful
tears
hardly
articulated
and
will
you
not
abhor
me
for
this
act
of
madness
but
i
was
not
myself
and
yet
where
should
i
live
but
at
the
feet
of
my
benefactor
the
steadfast
soul
of
wallace
was
subdued
by
this
language
and
the
manner
of
its
utterance
it
was
the
disinterested
dictates
of
a
pure
though
agitated
spirit
which
he
now
was
convinced
did
most
exclusively
love
him
but
with
the
passion
of
an
angel
and
the
tears
of
a
sympathy
which
spoke
their
kindred
natures
stole
from
his
eyes
as
he
bent
his
cheek
on
her
head
she
felt
them
and
rejoicing
in
such
an
assurance
that
she
yet
possessed
his
esteem
a
blessed
calm
diffused
itself
over
her
mind
and
raising
herself
with
a
look
of
virtuous
confidence
she
exclaimed
then
you
do
understand
me
wallace
you
pardon
me
this
apparent
forgetfulness
of
my
sex
and
you
recognize
a
true
sister
in
helen
mar
i
may
administer
to
that
noble
heart
till
she
paused
turning
deathly
pale
and
then
clasping
his
hand
in
both
hers
in
bitter
agony
added
till
we
meet
in
heaven
and
blissful
dearest
saint
will
be
our
union
there
replied
he
where
soul
meets
soul
unencumbered
of
these
earthly
fetters
and
mingles
with
each
other
even
as
thy
tender
teardrops
now
glide
into
mine
but
there
my
helen
we
shall
never
weep
no
heart
will
be
left
unsatisfied
no
spirit
will
mourn
in
unrequited
love
for
that
happy
region
is
the
abode
of
love
of
love
without
the
defilements
or
the
disquietudes
of
mortality
for
there
it
is
an
everlasting
pure
enjoyment
it
is
a
full
diffusive
tenderness
which
penetrating
all
hearts
unites
the
whole
in
one
spirit
of
boundless
love
in
the
bosom
of
our
god
who
the
source
of
all
love
as
john
the
beloved
disciple
saith
loved
a
lost
world
that
he
sent
his
only
son
to
redeem
it
from
its
sins
and
to
bring
it
to
eternal
blessedness
ah
cried
helen
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
in
holy
enthusiasm
join
then
your
prayers
with
mine
most
revered
of
friends
that
i
may
be
admitted
into
such
blessedness
petition
our
god
to
forgive
me
and
do
you
forgive
me
that
i
have
sometimes
envied
the
love
you
bear
your
marion
but
now
i
love
her
so
entirely
that
to
be
her
and
your
ministering
spirit
in
paradise
would
amply
satisfy
my
soul
o
helen
cried
wallace
grasping
her
uplifted
hands
in
his
and
clasping
them
to
his
heart
thy
soul
and
marion
are
indeed
one
and
as
one
i
love
ye
this
declaration
almost
overpowered
helen
in
its
flood
of
happiness
and
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
picture
the
very
heavens
opening
before
her
she
turned
her
eyes
from
him
to
a
crucifix
which
stood
on
a
table
and
bowing
her
head
on
its
pedestal
was
lost
in
the
devotion
of
rapturous
gratitude
at
this
juncture
when
perhaps
the
purest
bliss
that
ever
descended
on
woman
heart
now
glowed
in
that
of
helen
the
earl
of
gloucester
entered
his
were
not
visits
of
consolation
for
he
knew
that
his
friend
who
had
built
his
heroism
on
the
rock
of
christianity
did
not
require
the
comfortings
of
any
mortal
hand
at
sight
of
him
wallace
pointing
to
the
kneeling
helen
beckoned
him
into
the
inner
cell
where
his
straw
pallet
lay
and
there
in
a
low
voice
declared
who
she
was
and
requested
the
earl
to
use
his
authority
to
allow
her
to
remain
with
him
to
the
last
after
that
said
he
i
rely
on
you
generous
gloucester
to
convey
safely
back
to
her
country
a
being
who
seems
to
have
nothing
of
earth
about
her
but
the
terrestrial
body
which
enshrines
her
angelic
soul
the
sound
of
a
voice
speaking
with
wallace
roused
helen
from
her
happy
trance
alarmed
that
it
might
be
the
fatal
emissaries
of
the
tyrant
come
prematurely
to
summon
him
to
his
last
hour
she
started
on
her
feet
where
are
you
wallace
cried
she
looking
distractedly
around
her
i
must
be
with
you
even
in
death
hearing
her
fearful
cry
he
hastened
into
the
dungeon
and
relieved
her
immediate
terror
by
naming
the
earl
of
gloucester
who
followed
him
the
conviction
that
wallace
was
under
mortal
sentence
which
the
impression
of
his
eternal
bliss
had
just
almost
obliterated
now
glared
upon
her
with
redoubled
horrors
this
world
again
rose
before
her
in
the
person
of
gloucester
it
reminded
her
that
she
and
wallace
were
not
yet
passed
into
the
hereafter
whose
anticipated
reunion
had
wrapt
her
in
such
sweet
elysium
he
had
yet
the
bitter
cup
of
death
to
drink
to
the
dregs
and
all
of
human
weakness
again
writhed
within
her
bosom
and
is
there
no
hope
faltered
she
looking
earnestly
on
the
disturbed
face
of
gloucester
who
had
bowed
with
a
pitying
respect
to
her
as
he
approached
her
and
then
while
he
seemed
hesitating
for
an
answer
she
more
firmly
but
imploringly
resumed
oh
let
me
seek
your
king
once
he
was
a
crusade
prince
the
cross
was
then
on
his
breast
and
the
love
of
him
who
came
to
redeem
lost
man
nay
even
his
direst
enemies
from
death
unto
life
must
have
been
then
in
your
king
heart
oh
if
once
there
it
can
not
be
wholly
extinguished
now
let
me
gracious
earl
but
recall
to
him
that
he
was
then
beloved
by
a
queen
who
to
this
day
is
the
glory
of
her
sex
on
that
spot
of
holy
contest
she
preserved
his
life
from
an
assassin
poison
by
daring
the
sacrifice
of
her
own
but
she
lived
to
bless
him
and
to
be
blessed
herself
while
sir
william
wallace
also
a
christian
knight
anointed
by
virtue
and
his
cause
hath
only
done
for
his
own
country
and
its
trampled
land
what
king
edward
then
did
for
christendom
in
palestine
and
he
was
roused
to
the
defense
by
a
deed
worse
than
ever
infidel
inflicted
the
wife
of
his
bosom
who
had
all
of
angel
about
her
but
that
of
her
mortal
body
was
stabbed
by
a
murderous
southron
governor
in
scotland
because
she
would
not
betray
her
husband
to
his
desolating
brand
i
would
relate
this
on
my
knees
to
your
royal
edward
and
call
on
the
spirit
of
his
sainted
queen
to
enforce
my
suit
by
the
memory
of
her
love
and
her
devotedness
helen
who
had
risen
in
her
energy
of
speech
and
supplication
suddenly
paused
clasped
her
hands
and
stood
with
upward
eyes
looking
as
if
she
beheld
the
beatified
object
of
her
invocation
dearest
sister
of
my
soul
cried
wallace
who
had
forborne
to
interrupt
her
taking
her
clasped
hands
in
his
thy
knees
shall
never
bend
to
any
less
than
to
the
blessed
lord
of
all
mankind
for
me
did
he
will
my
longer
pilgrimage
on
this
earth
of
which
my
spirit
is
already
weary
it
would
not
be
in
the
power
of
any
human
tyrant
to
hold
me
in
these
bonds
and
for
edward
believe
that
not
all
thy
tender
eloquence
could
make
one
impression
where
a
long
obdurate
ambition
hath
set
so
deep
a
seal
i
am
content
to
go
my
sister
and
angels
whisper
me
and
his
voice
became
subdued
though
still
calm
while
he
added
in
a
lowered
tone
like
that
angel
whisper
that
thy
bridal
bed
will
be
in
william
wallace
grave
she
spoke
not
but
at
this
assurance
turned
her
tearful
eyes
upon
him
with
a
beam
of
delight
with
such
delight
the
vestal
consigns
herself
to
the
cloister
with
such
delight
the
widowed
mourner
lays
her
head
to
rest
on
the
tomb
of
him
she
loved
but
with
such
delight
none
are
acquainted
who
know
not
what
it
is
to
be
wedded
to
the
soul
of
a
beloved
being
when
the
body
which
was
once
its
vestment
lies
moldering
in
the
earth
gloucester
contemplated
this
chaste
union
of
two
spotless
hearts
with
an
admiration
almost
amounting
to
devotion
noble
lady
said
he
the
message
that
i
came
to
impart
to
sir
william
wallace
bears
with
it
a
show
of
hope
and
i
trust
that
your
gentle
spirit
will
yet
be
as
persuasive
as
consolatory
a
deputation
has
just
arrived
from
our
headed
by
the
good
barons
de
hilton
and
de
blenkinsopp
praying
the
royal
mercy
for
their
gallant
foe
who
had
been
most
generous
to
them
they
set
forth
in
their
extremity
and
the
king
was
listening
to
them
with
what
temper
i
know
not
when
a
private
embassy
as
opportunely
made
its
appearance
from
france
on
the
same
errand
in
short
to
negotiate
with
edward
for
the
safety
of
our
friend
as
a
prince
of
that
realm
i
left
the
embassadors
continued
the
earl
turning
to
wallace
in
debate
with
his
majesty
and
he
has
at
length
granted
a
suspension
nay
has
even
promised
a
repeal
of
the
horrible
injustice
that
was
to
be
completed
if
you
can
be
brought
to
accord
with
certain
proposals
now
to
be
laid
before
you
accept
them
and
edward
will
comply
with
all
king
demands
in
your
behalf
then
you
will
accept
them
cried
helen
in
a
tumult
of
suspense
the
communication
of
gloucester
had
made
no
change
in
the
equable
pulse
of
wallace
and
he
replied
with
a
look
of
tender
pity
upon
her
animated
countenance
the
proposals
of
edward
are
too
likely
to
be
snares
for
that
honor
which
i
would
bear
with
me
uncontaminated
to
the
grave
therefore
dearest
consoler
of
my
last
hours
do
not
give
way
to
hopes
which
a
greater
king
than
edward
may
command
me
to
disappoint
helen
bowed
her
head
in
silence
the
color
again
faded
from
her
cheek
and
despair
once
more
seized
on
her
heart
gloucester
resumed
and
after
narrating
some
particulars
concerning
the
conference
between
the
king
and
the
embassadors
he
suggested
the
impracticality
of
secretly
retaining
lady
helen
for
any
length
of
time
in
the
state
dungeon
i
dare
not
continued
he
be
privy
to
her
presence
here
and
yet
conceal
it
from
the
king
i
know
not
what
messengers
he
may
send
to
impart
his
conditions
to
you
and
should
she
be
discovered
edward
doubly
incensed
would
tear
her
from
you
and
as
an
accessory
so
involve
me
in
his
displeasure
that
i
should
be
disabled
from
serving
either
of
you
further
were
i
so
to
honor
his
feelings
as
a
man
as
to
mention
it
to
him
i
do
not
believe
that
he
would
oppose
her
wishes
but
how
to
reveal
such
a
circumstance
with
any
regard
to
her
fair
fame
i
know
not
for
all
are
not
sufficiently
virtuous
to
believe
her
spotless
innocence
helen
hastily
interrupted
gloucester
and
with
firmness
said
when
i
entered
these
walls
the
world
and
i
parted
forever
the
good
or
the
evil
opinion
of
the
impure
in
heart
can
never
affect
me
they
shall
never
see
me
more
the
innocent
will
judge
me
by
themselves
and
by
the
end
of
my
race
i
came
to
minister
with
a
sister
duty
to
my
own
and
my
father
preserver
and
while
he
abides
here
i
will
never
consent
to
leave
his
feet
when
he
goes
hence
if
it
be
to
bless
mankind
again
i
shall
find
the
longest
life
too
short
to
pour
forth
all
my
gratitude
and
for
that
purpose
i
will
dedicate
myself
in
some
nunnery
of
my
native
land
but
should
he
be
taken
from
a
world
so
unworthy
of
him
soon
very
soon
i
shall
cease
to
feel
its
aspersions
in
the
grave
no
aspersions
which
i
can
avert
dearest
helen
cried
wallace
shall
ever
tarnish
the
fame
of
one
whose
purity
can
only
be
transcended
by
her
who
is
now
made
perfect
in
heaven
consent
noblest
of
women
to
wear
for
the
few
days
i
may
yet
linger
here
a
name
which
thy
sister
angel
has
sanctified
to
me
give
me
a
legal
right
to
call
you
mine
and
edward
himself
will
not
then
dare
to
divide
what
god
has
joined
together
helen
paused
even
her
heart
seemed
to
cease
its
pulsation
in
the
awful
moment
did
she
hear
aright
and
was
she
indeed
going
to
invade
the
rights
of
the
wife
she
had
so
often
vowed
to
regard
as
the
sole
object
of
wallace
dearest
wishes
oh
no
it
was
not
the
lover
that
shone
in
his
luminous
eyes
it
was
not
the
mistress
that
glowed
in
her
bosom
words
might
be
breathed
but
no
change
would
be
wrought
in
the
souls
of
them
who
were
already
separated
from
the
earth
with
these
thoughts
helen
turned
toward
wallace
she
attempted
to
answer
but
the
words
died
on
the
seraphic
smile
which
beamed
upon
her
lips
and
she
dropped
her
head
upon
his
breast
gloucester
who
saw
no
other
means
of
insuring
to
his
friend
the
comfort
of
her
society
was
rejoiced
at
this
mutual
resolution
he
had
longed
to
propose
it
but
considering
the
peculiarities
of
their
situation
knew
not
how
to
do
so
without
seeming
to
mock
their
sensibility
and
fate
it
was
now
near
midnight
and
having
read
the
consent
of
helen
in
the
tender
emotion
which
denied
her
speech
without
further
delay
he
quitted
the
apartment
to
summon
the
confessor
of
the
warden
to
unite
their
hands
on
his
he
found
helen
sitting
dissolved
in
tears
with
her
hand
clasped
in
his
friend
the
sacred
rite
was
soon
performed
which
endowed
her
with
all
the
claims
upon
wallace
which
her
devoted
heart
had
so
long
contemplated
with
resigned
hopelessness
to
be
his
helpmate
on
earth
his
partner
in
the
tomb
his
dear
companion
in
heaven
with
the
last
benediction
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
and
put
his
hand
to
her
lips
in
eloquent
silence
gloucester
with
a
look
of
kind
farewell
withdrew
with
the
priest
thou
noble
daughter
of
the
noblest
scot
said
wallace
raising
her
from
the
ground
this
bosom
is
thy
place
and
not
my
feet
long
it
will
not
be
given
me
to
hold
thee
here
but
even
in
the
hours
of
years
of
our
separation
my
spirit
will
hover
near
thee
to
bear
thine
to
our
everlasting
home
the
heart
of
helen
alternatively
beat
violently
and
stopped
as
if
the
vital
current
were
suddenly
impeded
hope
and
fear
agitated
her
by
turns
but
clinging
to
the
flattering
ideas
which
the
arrival
of
the
embassadors
had
excited
she
timidly
breathed
a
hope
that
by
the
present
interferences
of
king
philip
edward
might
not
be
found
inexorable
disturb
not
the
holy
composure
of
your
soul
by
such
an
expectation
returned
wallace
i
know
my
adversary
too
well
to
anticipate
his
relinquishing
the
object
of
his
vengeance
but
at
a
price
more
infamous
than
the
most
ignoble
death
therefore
best
beloved
of
all
on
earth
look
for
no
deliverance
for
thy
wallace
but
what
passes
through
the
grave
and
to
me
dearest
helen
its
gates
are
on
golden
hinges
turning
for
all
is
light
and
bliss
which
shines
on
me
from
within
their
courts
helen
thoughts
in
the
idea
of
his
being
torn
from
her
could
not
wrest
themselves
from
the
dire
images
of
his
execution
she
shuddered
and
in
faltering
accents
replied
ah
could
we
glide
from
sleep
into
so
blessed
a
death
i
would
hail
it
even
for
thee
but
the
threatened
horrors
should
they
fall
on
thy
sacred
head
will
in
that
hour
i
trust
also
divorce
my
soul
from
this
grievous
world
not
so
my
helen
returned
he
keep
not
thy
dear
eyes
forever
fixed
on
the
gloomy
appendages
of
death
the
scaffold
and
the
grave
have
naught
to
do
with
the
immortal
soul
it
can
not
be
wounded
by
the
one
nor
confined
by
the
other
and
is
not
the
soul
thy
full
and
perfect
wallace
it
is
that
which
now
speaks
to
thee
which
will
cherish
thy
beloved
idea
forever
lament
not
then
how
soon
this
body
its
mere
apparel
is
laid
down
in
the
dust
but
rejoice
still
in
my
existence
which
through
him
who
captivity
captive
will
never
know
a
pause
comfort
then
thy
heart
my
soul
dear
sister
and
sojourn
a
little
while
on
this
earth
to
bear
witness
for
thy
wallace
to
the
friends
he
loves
helen
who
felt
the
import
of
his
words
in
her
heart
gently
bowed
her
head
and
he
proceeded
as
the
first
who
stemmed
with
me
the
torrent
which
with
god
help
we
so
often
laid
into
a
calm
i
mention
to
you
my
faithful
men
of
lanark
many
of
them
bled
and
died
in
the
contest
and
to
their
orphans
with
the
children
of
those
who
yet
survive
i
consign
all
of
the
world
wealth
that
yet
belongs
to
william
wallace
ellerslie
and
its
estates
are
theirs
to
bruce
my
sovereign
and
my
friend
the
loved
companion
of
the
hour
in
which
i
freed
you
my
helen
from
the
arms
of
violence
to
him
i
bequeath
this
heart
knit
to
him
by
bonds
more
dear
than
even
loyalty
bear
it
to
him
and
when
he
is
summoned
to
his
heavenly
throne
then
let
his
heart
and
mine
fill
up
one
urn
to
lord
ruthven
to
bothwell
to
lockhart
to
scrymgeour
and
to
kirkpatrick
i
give
my
prayers
and
blessings
bequest
of
wallace
is
a
fact
here
wallace
paused
helen
had
listened
to
him
with
a
holy
attention
which
hardly
allowed
a
sigh
to
breathe
from
her
steadfast
heart
she
spoke
but
the
voice
was
scarcely
audible
and
what
for
him
who
loves
you
dearer
than
life
for
edwin
he
can
not
be
forgotten
wallace
started
at
this
then
she
was
ignorant
of
the
death
of
that
friend
in
a
hurrying
accent
he
replied
never
forgotten
oh
helen
i
asked
for
him
life
and
heaven
gave
him
long
life
even
forever
and
ever
helen
eyes
met
his
with
a
look
of
inquiry
that
would
mean
he
is
gone
before
you
the
countenance
of
wallace
answered
her
happy
edwin
cried
she
and
the
tears
rained
over
her
cheeks
as
she
bent
her
head
on
her
arms
wallace
continued
he
laid
down
his
life
to
preserve
mine
in
the
hovel
of
lumloch
the
false
monteith
could
get
no
scot
to
lay
hands
on
their
true
defender
and
even
the
foreign
ruffians
he
brought
to
the
task
might
have
spared
the
noble
boy
but
an
arrow
from
the
traitor
himself
pierced
his
heart
contention
was
then
no
more
and
i
resigned
myself
to
follow
him
what
a
desert
does
the
world
become
exclaimed
helen
then
turning
on
wallace
with
a
smile
she
added
i
would
hardly
now
withhold
you
you
will
bear
him
helen
love
and
tell
him
how
soon
i
shall
be
with
you
if
your
father
would
not
allow
my
heart
to
break
in
his
mercy
he
may
take
my
soul
in
the
prayers
which
i
shall
hourly
breathe
to
him
thou
hast
been
lent
to
me
as
my
sweet
consolation
here
my
helen
replied
he
and
the
almighty
dispenser
of
that
comfort
will
not
long
banish
you
from
the
object
of
your
innocent
wishes
while
they
thus
poured
into
each
other
bosoms
the
ineffable
balm
of
friendship
purest
tenderness
the
eyes
of
wallace
insensibly
closed
your
gentle
influence
gently
murmured
he
brings
that
sleep
to
my
eyelids
which
has
not
visited
them
since
i
first
entered
these
walls
like
my
marion
helen
thy
presence
brings
healing
on
its
wings
sleep
then
replied
she
and
marion

will
keep
watch

chapter
lxxxiii
the
state
dungeon
though
all
the
furies
of
the
elements
seemed
let
loose
to
rage
around
the
walls
of
the
dungeon
still
wallace
slept
in
the
loud
uproar
calm
was
within
and
the
warfare
of
the
world
could
not
disturb
the
balmy
rest
into
which
the
angel
of
peace
had
steeped
his
senses
from
this
profound
repose
he
was
awakened
by
the
entrance
of
gloucester
helen
had
just
sunk
into
a
slight
slumber
but
the
first
words
of
the
earl
aroused
her
and
rising
she
followed
her
beloved
wallace
to
his
side
gloucester
put
a
scroll
into
the
hand
of
wallace
sign
that
said
he
and
you
are
free
i
know
not
its
contents
but
the
king
commissioned
me
as
a
mark
of
his
grace
to
be
the
messenger
of
your
release
wallace
read
the
conditions
and
the
color
deepened
on
his
cheek
as
his
eye
met
each
article
he
was
to
reveal
the
asylum
of
bruce
to
forswear
scotland
forever
and
to
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
edward
the
seal
of
which
should
be
the
english
earldom
of
cleveland
wallace
closed
the
parchment
king
edward
knows
what
will
be
my
reply
i
need
not
speak
it
you
will
accept
his
terms
asked
the
earl
not
to
insure
me
a
life
of
ages
with
all
earthly
bliss
my
portion
i
have
spoken
to
these
offers
before
read
them
my
noble
friend
and
then
give
him
as
mine
the
answer
which
would
be
yours
gloucester
obeyed
and
while
his
eyes
were
bent
on
the
parchment
those
of
helen
were
fixed
on
her
almost
worshiped
husband
she
looked
through
his
beaming
countenance
into
his
very
soul
and
there
saw
the
sublime
purpose
that
consigned
his
unbending
head
to
the
scaffold
when
gloucester
had
finished
covered
with
the
burning
blush
of
shame
he
crushed
the
disgraceful
scroll
in
his
hand
and
exclaimed
with
honorable
vehemence
against
the
deep
duplicity
the
deeper
cruelty
of
his
so
to
mock
by
base
subterfuges
the
embassy
of
france
and
its
noble
object
this
is
the
morning
in
which
i
was
to
have
met
my
fate
replied
wallace
tell
this
tyrant
of
the
earth
that
i
am
even
now
ready
to
receive
the
last
stroke
of
his
injustice
in
the
peaceful
grave
my
helen
added
he
turning
to
her
who
sat
pale
and
aghast
i
shall
be
beyond
his
power
gloucester
walked
the
room
in
great
disturbance
of
mind
while
wallace
continued
in
a
lowered
tone
to
recall
some
perception
of
his
own
consolations
to
the
abstracted
and
helen
the
earl
stopped
suddenly
before
them
that
the
king
did
not
expect
your
acquiescence
without
some
hesitation
i
can
not
doubt
for
when
i
informed
him
the
lady
helen
mar
now
your
wife
was
the
sharer
of
your
prison
he
started
and
told
me
that
should
you
still
oppose
yourself
to
his
conditions
i
must
bring
her
to
him
who
might
perhaps
be
the
means
of
persuading
you
to
receive
his
mercy
never
replied
wallace
i
reject
what
he
calls
mercy
he
has
no
rights
of
judgment
over
me
and
his
pretended
mercy
is
an
assumption
which
as
a
true
scot
i
despise
he
may
rifle
me
of
my
life
but
he
shall
never
beguile
me
into
any
acknowledgment
of
an
authority
that
is
false
no
wife
nor
aught
of
mine
shall
ever
stand
before
him
as
a
suppliant
for
william
wallace
i
will
die
as
i
have
lived
the
equal
of
edward
in
all
things
but
a
crown
and
his
superior
in
being
true
to
the
glory
of
prince
or
peasant
unblemished
honor
finding
the
scottish
chief
not
to
be
shaken
in
this
determination
gloucester
humbled
to
the
soul
by
the
base
tyranny
of
his
royal
soon
after
withdrew
to
acquaint
that
haughty
monarch
with
the
ill
success
of
his
embassy
but
ere
noon
had
turned
he
reappeared
with
a
countenance
declarative
of
some
distressing
errand
he
found
helen
awakened
to
the
full
perception
of
all
her
pending
evils
that
she
was
on
the
eve
of
losing
forever
the
object
dearest
to
her
in
this
world
and
though
she
wept
not
though
she
listened
to
the
lord
of
all
her
wishes
with
smiles
of
holy
approval
her
heart
bled
within
and
with
a
welcome
which
enforced
his
consolatory
arguments
she
hailed
her
own
inwardly
foreboding
mortal
pains
i
come
said
gloucester
not
to
urge
you
to
send
lady
helen
as
a
suitor
to
king
edward
but
to
spare
her
the
misery
of
being
separated
from
you
while
life
is
yours
he
then
said
that
the
french
embassadors
were
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
conditions
which
were
offered
to
the
object
of
their
mission
and
on
being
informed
that
he
had
refused
them
they
showed
themselves
so
little
satisfied
with
the
sincerity
of
what
had
been
done
that
edward
thought
it
expedient
to
conciliate
philip
by
taking
some
pains
to
dislodge
their
suspicions
to
this
effect
he
proposed
to
the
french
lords
sending
his
final
propositions
to
sir
william
wallace
by
that
chieftain
wife
who
he
found
was
then
his
companion
in
the
tower
on
my
intimating
continued
the
earl
that
i
feared
she
would
be
unable
to
appear
before
him
his
answer
was
her
see
to
that
such
a
refusal
shall
be
answered
by
an
immediate
separation
from
her
husband
let
me
in
this
demand
cried
she
turning
with
collected
firmness
to
wallace
satisfy
the
will
of
edward
it
is
only
to
purchase
my
continuance
with
you
trust
me
noblest
of
men
i
should
be
unworthy
of
the
name
you
have
given
me
could
i
sully
it
in
my
person
by
one
debasing
word
or
action
to
the
author
of
all
our
ills
ah
my
helen
replied
he
what
is
it
you
ask
am
i
to
live
to
see
a
repetition
of
the
horrors
of
ellerslie
no
on
my
life
answered
glouceseter
in
this
instance
i
would
pledge
my
soul
for
king
edward
manhood
his
ambition
might
lead
him
to
trample
on
all
men
but
still
for
woman
he
feels
as
becomes
a
man
and
a
knight
helen
renewed
her
supplications
and
wallace
aware
that
should
he
withhold
her
attendance
his
implacable
adversary
however
he
might
spare
her
personal
injury
would
not
forbear
wounding
her

an
unwilling
consent
to
what
might
seem
a
submission
on
his
part
to
an
authority
he
had
shed
his
blood
to
oppose
helen
renewed
her
supplications
and
wallace
aware
that
should
he
withhold
her
attendance
his
implacable
adversary
however
he
might
spare
her
personal
injury
would
not
forbear
wounding
her
to
the
soul
by
tearing
her
from
him
gave
an
unwilling
consent
to

might
seem
a
submission
on
his
part
to
an
authority
he
had
shed
his
blood
to

but
not
in
these
garments
said
he
she
must
be
habited
as
becomes
her
sex
and
her
own
delicacy
anticipating
this
propriety
gloucester
had
imparted
the
circumstance
to
his
countess
and
she
had
sent
a
casket
which
the
earl
himself
now
brought
in
from
the
passage
helen
retired
to
the
inner
cell
and
hastily
arranging
herself
in
the
first
suit
that
presented
itself
reappeared
in
female
apparel
and
wrapped
in
a
long
veil
as
gloucester
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
forth
wallace
clasped
the
other
in
his
remember
my
helen
cried
he
that
on
no
terms
but
untrammeled
freedom
of
soul
will
your
wallace
accept
of
life
this
will
not
be
granted
by
the
man
to
whom
you
go
then
speak
and
act
in
his
presence
as
if
i
were
already
beyond
the
skies
had
this
faithful
friend
now
his
almost
adoring
wife
left
his
side
with
more
sanguine
hopes
how
grievously
would
they
have
been
blasted
after
an
absence
of
two
hours
she
returned
to
the
dungeon
of
wallace
and
as
her
trembling
form
was
clasped
in
his
arms
she
exclaimed
in
a
passion
of
tears
here
will
i
live
here
will
i
die
they
may
sever
my
soul
from
my
body
but
never
again
part
me
from
this
dear
bosom
never
never
my
helen
said
he
reading
her
conference
with
the
king
in
the
wild
terror
of
its
effects
her
senses
seemed
fearfully
disordered
while
she
clung
to
him
and
muttered
sentences
of
an
incoherency
that
shook
him
to
the
soul
he
cast
a
look
of
such
expressive
inquiry
upon
gloucester
that
the
earl
could
only
answer
by
hastily
putting
his
hand
on
his
face
to
hide
his
emotion
at
last
the
tears
she
shed
appeared
to
relieve
the
excess
of
her
agonies
and
she
gradually
sunk
into
an
awful
calm
then
rising
from
her
arms
she
seated
herself
on
his
stony
couch
and
said
in
a
firm
voice
earl
i
can
now
bear
to
hear
you
repeat
the
last
decision
of
the
king
of
england
though
not
absolutely
present
at
the
interview
between
his
sovereign
and
lady
helen
from
the
anteroom
gloucester
had
heard
all
that
passed
and
now
he
briefly
confessed
to
wallace
that
he
had
too
truly
appreciated
the
pretended
conciliation
of
the
king
edward
proposals
to
helen
were
as
artfully
couched
as
deceptive
in
their
design
their
issue
was
to
make
wallace
his
slave
or
to
hold
him
his
victim
in
his
conference
with
her
he
addressed
the
vanity
of
an
ambitious
woman
then
all
the
affections
of
a
devoted
heart
he
enforced
his
arguments
with
persuasions
to
allure
and
threats
to
compel
obedience
in
the
last
he
called
up
every
image
to
appall
the
soul
of
helen
but
steadfast
in
the
principles
of
her
lord
while
ready
to
sink
under
the
menaced
horrors
of
his
fate
she
summoned
all
her
strength
to
give
utterance
to
her
last
reply
mortal
distinctions
king
of
england
cried
she
can
not
bribe
the
wife
of
sir
william
wallace
to
betray
his
virtues
his
life
is
dear
to
me
but
his
immaculate
faith
to
his
god
and
his
lawful
prince
are
dearer
i
can
see
him
die
and
live
for
i
shall
join
him
triumphant
in
heaven
but
to
behold
him
dishonor
himself
to
counsel
him
so
to
do
is
beyond
my
power
i
should
expire
with
grief
in
the
shameful
moment
the
indignation
of
the
king
at
this
answer
was
too
oppressive
of
the
tender
nature
of
lady
wallace
for
gloucester
to
venture
repeating
it
to
her
husband
and
while
she
turned
deathly
pale
at
the
recollection
wallace
exulting
in
her
conduct
pressed
her
hand
silently
but
fervently
to
his
lips
the
earl
resumed
but
observing
the
reawakened
agonies
of
her
mind
in
her
too
expressive
countenance
he
strove
to
soften
the
blow
he
must
inflict
in
the
remainder
of
his
narrative
dearest
lady
said
he
rather
addressing
her
than
wallace
to
convince
your
suffering
spirit
that
no
earthly
means
have
been
left
unessayed
to
change
the
unjust
purpose
of
the
king
know
that
when
he
quitted
you
i
left
in
his
presence
the
queen
and
my
wife
both
weeping
tears
of
disappointment
on
the
moment
when
i
found
that
arguments
could
no
longer
avail
i
implored
him
by
every
consideration
of
god
and
man
to
redeem
his
honor
sacrificed
by
the
unjust
decree
pronounced
on
sir
william
wallace
my
entreaties
were
repulsed
with
anger
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
lord
athol
with
fresh
fuel
to
his
flame
so
confirmed
his
direful
resolution
that
desperate
for
my
friend
i
threw
myself
on
my
knees
the
queen
and
then
my
wife
both
prostrate
at
his
feet
enforced
my
suit
but
all
in
vain
his
heart
seemed
hardened
by
our
earnestness
and
his
answer
while
it
put
us
to
silence
granted
wallace
a
triumph
even
in
his
dungeon
cease
cried
the
king
wallace
and
i
have
now
come
to
that
issue
where
one
must
fall
i
shall
use
my
advantage
though
i
should
walk
over
the
necks
of
half
my
kindred
to
accomplish
his
fate
i
can
find
no
security
on
my
throne
no
peace
in
my
bed
until
i
know
that
he
my
direst
enemy
is
no
more
sorry
am
i
generous
gloucester
interrupted
wallace
that
for
my
life
you
have
stooped
your
knee
to
one
so
unworthy
of
your
nobleness
let
then
his
tyranny
take
its
course
but
its
shaft
will
not
reach
the
soul
his
unkingly
spirit
hopes
to
wound
the
bitterness
of
death
was
passed
when
i
quitted
scotland
and
for
this
body
he
may
dishonor
it
mangle
its
limbs
but
william
wallace
may
then
be
far
beyond
his
reach
gloucester
gazed
on
him
doubting
the
expression
of
his
countenance
it
was
calm
but
pale
even
to
a
marble
hue
surely
said
he
my
unconquered
friend
will
not
now
be
forced
to
self
violence
god
forbid
returned
wallace
suspect
me
not
of
such
base
vassalage
to
this
poor
tabernacle
of
clay
did
i
believe
it
my
father
will
that
i
should
die
at
every
pore
i
would
submit
for
so
his
immaculate
son
laid
down
his
life
for
a
rebellious
world
and
is
a
servant
greater
than
his
master
that
i
should
say
exempt
me
from
this
trial
no
i
await
his
summons
but
he
so
strengthens
my
soul
on
his
breast
that
the
cord
of
edward
shall
never
make
my
scottish
neck
feel
its
degrading
touch
his
pale
cheek
was
now
luminous
with
a
bright
smile
as
he
pressed
his
swelling
heart
with
reawakened
horror
helen
listened
to
the
words
of
wallace
which
referred
to
the
last
outrage
to
be
committed
on
his
sacred
remains
she
recalled
the
corresponding
threats
of
the
king
and
again
losing
starting
wildly
up
exclaimed
and
is
there
no
humanity
in
that
ruthless
man
oh
cried
she
tearing
her
eyes
from
the
beloved
form
on
which
it
had
been
such
bliss
to
gaze
let
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
be
offered
to
this
cruel
king
to
save
from
indignity
she
could
add
no
more
but
dropped
half
lifeless
on
the
arm
of
wallace
gloucester
understood
the
object
of
such
anguished
solicitude
and
while
wallace
again
seated
her
he
revived
her
by
a
protestation
that
the
clause
she
so
fearfully
deprecated
had
been
repealed
by
edward
but
the
good
earl
blushed
as
he
spoke
for
in
this
instance
he
said
what
was
not
the
truth
far
different
had
been
the
issue
of
all
his
attempts
at
mitigation
the
arrival
of
athol
from
scotland
with
advices
from
the
countess
of
strathearn
that
lady
helen
mar
had
fled
southward
to
raise
an
insurrection
in
favor
of
wallace
and
that
lord
bothwell
had
gone
to
france
to
move
philip
to
embrace
the
same
cause
gave
edward
so
apt
an
excuse
for
giving
full
way
to
his
hatred
against
the
scottish
chief
that
he
pronounced
an
order
for
the
immediate
and
unrestricted
execution
of
his
sentence
artifice
to
mislead
the
french
embassadors
with
an
idea
that
he
was
desirous
to
accord
with
their
royal
master
wish
had
been
the
sole
foundation
of
his
proposals
to
wallace
and
his
interview
with
lady
helen
though
so
intemperately
conducted
was
dictated
by
the
same
subtle
policy
when
gloucester
found
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
any
further
respite
from
the
murderous
decree
he
attempted
to
prevail
for
the
remission
of
the
last
clause
which
ordered
that
his
friend
noble
body
should
be
dismembered
and
his
limbs
sent
as
terrors
to
rebellion
to
the
four
capital
fortresses
of
scotland
edward
spurned
at
this
petition
with
even
more
acrimony
than
he
had
done
the
prayer
for
his
victim
life
and
gloucester
then
starting
from
his
knee
in
a
burst
of
honest
indignation
exclaimed
oh
king
remember
what
is
done
by
thee
this
day
refusing
to
give
righteous
judgment
in
favor
of
one
who
prefers
virtue
to
a
crown
and
life
as
insincere
as
secret
have
been
your
last
conditions
with
him
but
they
will
be
revealed
when
the
great
judge
that
searcheth
all
men
hearts
shall
cause
thee
to
answer
for
this
matter
at
the
dreadful
day
of
universal
doom
thou
has
now
given
sentence
on
a
patriot
and
a
prince
and
then
shall
judgment
be
given
on
thee
dangerous
indeed
is
his
rebellious
spirit
cried
edward
in
almost
speechless
wrath
since
it
affects
even
the
duty
of
my
own
house
gloucester
leave
my
presence
and
on
pain
of
your
own
death
dare
not
approach
me
till
i
send
for
you
to
see
this
rebel
head
on
london
bridge
to
disappoint
the
revengeful
monarch
of
at
least
this
object
of
his
malice
gloucester
was
now
resolved
and
imparting
his
wishes
to
the
warden
of
the
tower
who
was
his
trusty
friend
he
laid
a
plan
accordingly
helen
had
believed
his
declaration
to
her
and
bowed
her
head
in
sign
that
she
was
satisfied
with
his
zeal
the
earl
addressing
wallace
continued
could
i
have
purchased
thy
life
thou
preserver
of
mine
with
the
forfeiture
of
all
i
possess
i
should
have
rejoiced
in
the
exchange
but
as
that
may
not
be
is
there
aught
in
the
world
which
i
can
do
to
administer
to
thy
wishes
generous
gloucester
exclaimed
wallace
how
unwearied
has
been
your
friendship
but
i
shall
not
tax
it
much
further
i
was
writing
my
last
wishes
when
this
angel
entered
my
apartment
she
will
now
be
the
voice
of
william
wallace
to
his
friends
but
still
i
must
make
one
request
to
you
one
which
i
trust
will
not
be
out
of
your
power
let
this
heart
ever
faithful
to
scotland
be
at
least
buried
in
its
native
country
when
i
cease
to
breathe
give
it
to
helen
and
she
will
mingle
it
with
the
sacred
dust
of
those
i
love
for
herself
dear
gloucester
ah
guard
the
vestal
purity
and
life
of
my
best
beloved
for
there
are
those
who
when
i
am
gone
may
threaten
both
gloucester
who
knew
that
in
this
apprehension
wallace
meant
the
lords
soulis
and
de
valence
pledged
himself
for
the
performance
of
his
first
request
and
for
the
second
he
assured
him
he
would
protect
helen
as
a
sister
but
she
regardless
of
all
other
evils
than
that
of
being
severed
from
her
dearest
and
best
friend
exclaimed
in
bitter
sorrow
wherever
i
am
still
and
forever
shall
all
of
wallace
that
remains
on
earth
be
with
me
he
gave
himself
to
me
and
no
mortal
power
shall
divide
us
gloucester
could
not
reply
before
the
voice
of
the
warden
calling
to
him
that
the
hour
of
shutting
the
gates
was
arrived
compelled
him
to
bid
his
friend
farewell
he
grasped
the
hand
of
wallace
with
a
strong
emotion
for
he
knew
that
the
next
time
he
should
meet
him
would
be
on
the
scaffold
during
the
moments
of
his
parting
helen
with
her
hands
clasped
on
her
knees
and
her
eyes
bent
downward
inwardly
and
earnestly
invoked
the
almighty
to
endow
her
with
fortitude
to
bear
the
horrors
she
was
to
witness
that
she
might
not
by
her
agonies
add
to
the
tortures
of
wallace
the
cheering
voice
that
was
ever
music
to
her
ears
recalled
her
from
this
devout
abstraction
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
gazing
on
her
with
a
tender
pity
held
such
sweet
discourse
with
her
on
the
approaching
end
of
all
his
troubles
of
his
everlasting
happiness
where
all
tears
are
dried
away
that
she
listened
and
wept
and
even
smiled
yes
added
he
a
little
while
and
my
virgin
bride
shall
give
me
her
dear
embrace
in
heaven
angels
will
participate
our
joy
and
my
marion
grateful
spirit
join
the
blest
communion
she
died
to
preserve
my
life
you
suffered
a
living
death
to
maintain
my
honor
can
i
then
divide
ye
noblest
of
created
beings
in
my
soul
take
then
my
heart
kiss
dear
helen
thy
wallace
last
earthly
kiss
she
bent
toward
him
and
fixed
her
lips
to
his
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
his
parting
words
still
hung
on
them
and
an
icy
cold
ran
through
all
her
veins
she
felt
his
heart
beat
heavily
against
hers
as
he
said
i
have
not
many
hours
to
be
with
thee
and
yet
a
strange
lethargy
overpowers
my
senses
but
i
shall
speak
to
thee
again
he
looked
on
her
as
he
spoke
with
such
a
glance
of
holy
love
that
not
doubting
he
was
now
bidding
her
indeed
his
last
farewell
that
he
was
to
pass
from
this
sleep
out
of
the
power
of
man
she
pressed
his
hand
without
a
word
and
as
he
dropped
his
head
back
upon
his
straw
pillow
with
an
awed
spirit
she
saw
him
sink
to
profound
repose
chapter
lxxxiv
tower
hill
long
and
silently
had
she
watched
his
rest
so
gentle
was
his
breath
that
he
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
and
often
during
her
sad
vigils
did
she
stoop
her
cheek
to
feel
the
respiration
which
might
still
bear
witness
that
his
outraged
spirit
was
yet
fettered
to
earth
she
tremblingly
placed
her
hand
on
his
heart
and
still
its
warm
beats
spake
comfort
to
hers
the
soul
of
wallace
as
well
as
his
beloved
body
was
yet
clasped
in
her
arms
the
arms
of
a
sister
enfold
thee
murmured
she
to
herself
they
would
gladly
bear
thee
up
to
lay
thee
on
the
bosom
of
thy
martyred
wife
and
there
how
wouldst
thou
smile
upon
and
bless
me
and
shall
we
not
meet
so
before
the
throne
of
him
whose
name
is
truth
the
first
rays
of
the
dawn
shone
upon
his
peaceful
face
just
as
the
door
opened
and
a
priest
appeared
he
held
in
his
hands
the
sacred
host
and
the
golden
dove
for
performing
the
rites
of
the
dying
at
this
sight
the
harbinger
of
a
fearful
doom
the
fortitude
of
helen
forsook
her
and
throwing
her
arms
frantically
over
the
sleeping
wallace
she
exclaimed
he
is
dead
his
sacrament
is
now
with
the
lord
of
mercy
her
voice
awakened
wallace
he
started
from
his
position
and
helen
seeing
with
a
wild
sort
of
disappointment
that
he
whose
gliding
to
death
in
his
sleep
she
had
even
so
lately
deprecated
now
indeed
lived
to
mount
the
scaffold
in
unutterable
horror
fell
back
with
a
heavy
groan
wallace
accosted
the
priest
with
a
reverential
welcome
and
then
turning
to
helen
tenderly
whispered
her
my
helen
in
this
moment
of
my
last
on
earth
o

thee
in
the
kindness
of
thy
youth
in
the
love
of
thy
desolate
espousals

me
when
thou
camest
after
me
into
the
wilderness
into

land

our
lord

i
commit
thee
in
steadfast
faith
that

then
o
dearest
part
of

let
not
the
completion
of
my
fate
shake
your
dependence
on
the
only
true
and
just
rejoice
that
wallace
has
been
deemed
worthy
to
die
for
his
having
done
his
duty
and
what
is
death
my
helen
that
we
should
shun
it
even
to
rebelling
against
the
lord
of
life
is
it
not
the
door
which
opens
to
us
immortality
and
in
that
blest
moment
who
will
regret
that
he
passed
through
it
in
the
bloom
of
his
years
come
then
sister
of
my
soul
and
share
with
thy
wallace
the
last
supper
of
his
lord
the
pledge
of
the
happy
eternity
to
which
by
his
grace
i
now
ascend
helen
and
to
holy
confidence
by
the
heavenly
composure
of
his
manner
obeyed
the
impulse
of
his
hand
and
they
both
knelt
before
the
minister
of
peace
while
the
sacred
rite
proceeded
it
seemed
the
indissoluble
union
of
helen
spirit
with
that
of
wallace
my
life
will
expire
with
his
was
her
secret
response
to
the
venerable
man
exhortation
to
the
anticipated
passing
soul
and
when
he
sealed
wallace
with
the
holy
cross
under
the
last
unction
as
one
who
believed
herself
standing
on
the
brink
of
eternity
she
longed
to
share
also
that
mark
of
death
at
that
moment
the
dismal
toll
of
a
bell
sounded
from
the
top
of
the
tower
the
heart
of
helen
paused
the
warden
and
his
train
entered
i
will
follow
him
cried
she
starting
from
her
knees
into
the
grave
itself
what
was
said
what
was
done
she
knew
not
till
she
found
herself
on
the
scaffold
upheld
by
the
arm
of
gloucester
wallace
stood
before
her
with
his
hands
bound
across
and
his
noble
head
uncovered
his
eyes
were
turned
upward
with
a
martyr
confidence
in
the
power
he
served
a
silence
as
of
some
desert
waste
reigned
throughout
the
thousands
who
stood
below
the
executioner
approached
to
throw
the
rope
over
the
neck
of
his
victim
at
this
sight
helen
with
a
cry
that
was
by
the
compassionate
spectators
rushed
to
his
bosom
wallace
with
a
mighty
strength
burst
the
bands
asunder
which
confined
his
arms
and
clasping
her
to
him
with
a
force
that
seemed
to
make
her
touch
his
very
heart
his
breast
heaved
as
if
his
soul
were
breaking
from
its
outraged
tenement
and
while
his
head
sunk
on
her
neck
he
exclaimed
in
a
low
and
interrupted
voice
my
prayer
is
heard
helen
life
cord
is
cut
by
god
own
hand
may
he
preserve
my
country
and
oh
trust
from
my
youth
he
stopped
he
fell
and
with
the
shock
the
scaffold
shook
to
its
foundation
the
pause
was
dreadful
the
executioner
approached
the
prostrate
chief
helen
was
still
locked
close
in
his
arms
the
man
stooped
to
raise
his
victim
but
the
attempt
was
beyond
his
strength
in
vain
he
called
on
him
to
helen
to
separate
and
cease
from
delaying
the
execution
of
the
law
no
voice
replied
no
motion
answered
his
loud
remonstrance
gloucester
with
an
agitation
which
hardly
allowed
him
power
to
speak
or
move
remembered
the
words
of
wallace
that
the
rope
of
edward
would
never
sully
his
animate
body
and
bending
to
his
friend
he
spoke
but
all
was
silent
there
he
raised
the
chieftain
head
and
looking
on
his
face
found
indeed
the
indisputable
stamp
of
death
there
cried
he
in
a
burst
of
grief
and
letting
it
fall
again
upon
the
insensible
bosom
of
helen
there
broke
the
noblest
heart
that
ever
beat
in
the
breast
of
man
the
priests
the
executioners
crowded
round
him
at
this
declaration
but
while
giving
a
command
in
a
low
tone
to
the
warden
he
took
the
motionless
helen
in
his
arms
and
leaving
the
astonished
group
round
the
noble
dead
carried
her
from
the
scaffold
back
into
the
tower
last
words
of
wallace
were
from
the
psalm
my
trust
from
my
youth
o
lord
god
thou
art
my
hope
unto
the
end
chapter
lxxxv
the
warden
apartments
on
the
evening
of
the
fatal
day
in
which
the
sun
of
william
wallace
had
set
forever
on
his
country
the
earl
of
gloucester
was
imparting
to
the
warden
of
the
tower
his
last
directions
respecting
the
sacred
remains
when
the
door
of
the
chamber
suddenly
opened
and
a
file
of
soldiers
entered
a
man
in
armor
with
his
visor
closed
was
in
the
midst
of
them
the
captain
of
the
band
told
the
warden
that
the
person
before
him
had
behaved
in
a
most
seditious
manner
he
first
demanded
admittance
into
the
tower
then
on
the
sentinel
making
answer
that
in
consequence
of
the
recent
execution
of
the
scottish
chief
orders
had
been
given
to
allow
no
strangers
to
approach
the
gates
till
the
following
morning
he
the
prisoner
burst
into
a
passionate
emotion
uttering
such
threats
against
the
king
of
england
that
the
captain
thought
it
his
duty
to
have
him
seized
and
brought
before
the
warden
on
the
entrance
of
the
soldiers
gloucester
had
retired
into
the
shadow
of
the
room
he
turned
round
on
hearing
these
particulars
when
the
captain
ceased
speaking
the
stranger
fearlessly
threw
up
his
visor
and
exclaimed
take
me
not
to
our
warden
alone
but
to
your
king
let
me
pierce
his
conscience
with
his
infamy
would
it
were
to
stab
him
ere
i
die
in
this
frantic
adjuration
gloucester
discovered
the
gallant
bruce
and
hastening
toward
him
to
prevent
his
apparently
determined
exposure
of
himself
with
a
few
words
he
dismissed
the
officer
and
his
guard
and
then
turning
to
the
warden
sir
edward
said
he
this
stranger
is
not
less
my
friend
than
he
that
was
sir
william
wallace
then
far
be
it
from
me
earl
to
denounce
him
to
our
enraged
monarch
i
have
seen
enough
of
noble
blood
shed
already
and
though
we
the
subjects
of
king
edward
may
not
call
your
late
friend
a
martyr
yet
we
must
think
his
country
honored
in
so
steady
a
patriot
and
may
surely
wish
we
had
many
the
like
in
our
own
with
these
words
the
worthy
old
knight
bowed
and
withdrew
bruce
who
had
hardly
heard
the
observation
of
the
warden
on
his
departure
turned
upon
the
earl
and
with
a
bursting
heart
exclaimed
tell
me
is
it
true
am
i
so
lost
a
wretch
as
to
be
deprived
of
my
best
my
dearest
friend
and
is
it
true
as
i
am
told
that
every
infernal
rigor
of
the
sentence
has
been
executed
on
that
brave
and
breathless
body
answer
me
to
the
fact
that
i
may
speedily
take
my
course
alarmed
at
the
direful
expression
of
his
countenance
with
a
quivering
lip
but
in
silence
gloucester
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
bruce
too
well
understood
what
he
durst
not
speak
and
shaking
it
off
frantically
i
have
no
friend
cried
he
wallace
my
dauntless
my
only
wallace
thou
art
rifled
from
me
and
shall
i
have
fellowship
with
these
no
all
mankind
are
my
enemies
and
soon
will
i
leave
their
detested
sojourn
gloucester
attempted
to
interrupt
him
but
he
broke
out
afresh
and
with
redoubled
violence
and
you
earl
cried
he
lived
in
this
realm
and
suffered
such
a
sacrilege
on
god
most
perfect
work
ungrateful
worthless
man
fill
up
the
measure
of
your
baseness
deliver
me
to
edward
and
let
me
brave
him
to
his
face
oh
let
me
die
covered
with
the
blood
of
thy
enemies
my
murdered
wallace
my
more
than
brother
that
shall
be
the
royal
robe
thy
bruce
will
bring
to
thee
gloucester
stood
in
dignified
forbearance
under
the
invectives
and
stormy
grief
of
the
scottish
prince
but
when
exhausted
nature
seemed
to
take
rest
in
momentary
silence
he
approached
him
bruce
cast
on
him
a
lurid
glance
of
suspicion
leave
me
cried
he
i
hate
the
whole
world
and
you
the
worst
in
it
for
you
might
have
saved
him
and
you
did
not
you
might
have
preserved
his
sacred
limbs
from
being
made
the
of
traitors
and
you
did
not
away
from
me
apt
son
of
a
tyrant
lest
i
tear
you
in
piecemeal
by
the
heroic
spirit
of
him
whom
this
outrage
on
me
dishonors
hear
my
answer
bruce
and
if
not
on
this
spot
let
me
then
exculpate
myself
by
the
side
of
his
body
yet
uninvaded
by
a
sacrilegious
touch
how
interrupted
bruce
gloucester
continued
all
that
was
mortal
in
our
friend
now
lies
in
a
distant
chamber
of
this
quadrangle
when
i
could
not
prevail
on
edward
either
by
entreaty
or
reproaches
to
remit
the
last
gloomy
vengeance
of
tyrants
i
determined
to
wrest
its
object
from
his
hands
a
notorious
murderer
died
yesterday
under
the
torture
after
the
inanimate
corpse
of
our
friend
was
brought
into
this
house
to
be
conveyed
to
the
scene
of
its
last
horrors
by
the
assistance
of
the
warden
the
malefactor
body
was
conveyed
here
also
and
placed
on
the
traitor
sledge
in
the
stead
of
his
who
was
no
traitor
and
on
that
murderer
most
justly
fell
the
rigor
of
so
dreadful
a
sentence
the
whole
aspect
of
bruce
changed
during
this
explanation
which
was
followed
by
a
brief
account
from
gloucester
of
their
friend
heroic
suffering
and
death
can
you
pardon
my
reproaches
to
you
cried
the
prince
stretching
out
his
hand
forgive
generous
gloucester
the
distraction
of
a
severely
wounded
spirit
this
pardon
was
immediately
accorded
and
bruce
impetuously
added
lead
me
to
these
dear
remains
that
with
redoubled
certainty
i
may
strike
his
murderer
heart
i
came
to
succor
him
i
now
stay
to
die
but
not
unrevenged
i
will
lead
you
returned
the
earl
where
you
shall
learn
a
different
lesson
his
soul
will
speak
to
you
by
the
lips
of
his
bride
now
watching
by
those
sacred
relics
feeble
is
now
her
lamp
of
life
but
a
saint
vigilance
keeps
it
burning
till
it
may
expire
in
the
grave
with
him
she
so
chastely
loved
a
few
words
gave
bruce
to
understand
that
he
meant
lady
helen
mar
and
with
a
deepened
grief
when
he
heard
in
what
an
awful
hour
their
hands
were
plighted
he
followed
his
conductor
through
the
quadrangle
when
gloucester
gently
opened
the
door
which
contained
the
remains
of
the
bravest
and
the
best
bruce
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
lighted
by
a
solitary
taper
lay
the
body
of
wallace
on
a
bier
covered
with
a
soldier
cloak
kneeling
by
its
side
with
her
head
on
its
bosom
was
helen
her
hair
hung
disordered
over
her
shoulders
and
shrouded
with
its
dark
locks
the
marble
features
of
her
beloved
bruce
scarcely
breathed
he
attempted
to
advance
but
he
staggered
and
fell
against
the
wall
she
looked
up
at
the
noise
but
her
momentary
alarm
ceased
when
she
saw
gloucester
he
spoke
in
a
tender
voice
be
not
agitated
lady
but
here
is
the
earl
of
carrick
nothing
can
agitate
me
more
replied
she
turning
mournfully
toward
the
prince
who
raised
from
his
momentary
dizziness
beheld
her
regarding
him
with
the
look
of
one
already
an
inhabitant
of
the
grave
helen
faintly
articulated
bruce
i
come
to
share
your
sorrows
and
to
avenge
them
avenge
them
repeated
she
after
a
pause
is
there
aught
in
vengeance
that
can
awaken
life
in
these
cold
veins
again
let
the
murderers
live
in
the
world
they
have
made
a
desert
by
the
destruction
of
its
brightest
glory
and
then
our
home
will
be
his
tomb
again
she
bent
her
head
upon
wallace
cold
breast
and
seemed
to
forget
that
she
had
been
spoken
to
that
bruce
was
present
may
i
not
look
upon
him
cried
he
grasping
her
hand
oh
helen
show
me
that
heroic
face
from
whose
beams
my
heart
first
caught
the
fire
of
virtue
she
moved
and
the
features
of
all
that
was
ever
perfect
in
manly
beauty
met
his
sight
but
the
bright
eyes
were
shut
the
radiance
of
his
smile
was
dimmed
in
death
yet
still
that
smile
was
there
bruce
precipitated
his
lips
to
his
and
sinking
on
his
knees
remained
in
a
silence
only
broken
by
his
sighs
it
was
an
awful
and
pause
for
the
voice
which
in
all
scenes
of
weal
or
woe
had
ever
mingled
sweetly
with
theirs
was
silent
helen
who
had
not
wept
since
the
tremendous
hour
of
the
morning
now
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
and
the
vehemence
of
her
feelings
tearing
so
delicate
a
frame
now
rendered
weak
unto
death
by
a
consuming
sickness
which
her
late
exertions
and
present
griefs
had
made
seize
on
her
very
vitals
seemed
to
threaten
the
immediate
extinction
of
her
being
bruce
aroused
by
her
smothered
cries
as
she
lay
almost
expiring
upheld
by
gloucester
hurried
to
her
side
by
degrees
she
recovered
to
life
and
observance
but
finding
herself
removed
from
the
bier
she
sprang
wildly
toward
it
bruce
caught
her
arm
to
support
her
tottering
steps
she
looked
steadfastly
at
him
and
then
at
the
motionless
body
he
is
there
cried
she
and
yet
he
speaks
not
he
soothes
not
my
grief
i
weep
and
he
does
not
comfort
me
and
there
he
lies
o
bruce
can
this
be
possible
do
i
really
see
him
dead
and
what
is
death
added
she
grasping
the
cold
hand
of
wallace
to
her
heart
didst
thou
not
tell
me
when
this
hand
pressed
mine
and
blessed
me
that
it
was
only
a
translation
from
grief
to
joy
and
is
it
not
so
bruce
behold
how
we
mourn
and
he
is
happy
i
will
obey
thee
my
immortal
wallace
cried
she
casting
her
arms
about
him
i
will
obey
thee
and
weep
no
more
she
was
silent
and
calm
and
bruce
kneeling
on
the
opposite
side
of
his
friend
listened
without
interrupting
him
to
the
arguments
which
gloucester
adduced
to
persuade
him
to
abstain
from
discovering
himself
to
edward
or
even
uttering
resentment
against
him
till
he
could
do
both
as
became
the
man
for
whom
wallace
had
sacrificed
so
much
even
till
he
was
king
of
scotland
to
that
end
said
gloucester
did
this
gallant
chieftain
live
for
in
restoring
you
to
the
people
of
scotland
he
believed
he
was
setting
a
seal
to
their
liberties
and
their
peace
to
that
end
did
he
die
and
in
the
direful
moment
uttered
prayers
for
your
establishment
think
then
of
this
and
let
him
not
look
down
from
his
heavenly
dwelling
and
see
that
bruce
despises
the
country
for
which
he
bled
that
the
now
only
hope
of
scotland
has
sacrificed
himself
in
a
moment
of
inconsiderate
revenge
to
the
cruel
hand
which
broke
his
dauntless
heart
bruce
did
not
oppose
this
counsel
and
as
the
fumes
of
passion
passed
away
leaving
a
manly
sorrow
to
steady
his
determination
of
revenge
he
listened
with
approbation
and
finally
resolved
whatever
violence
he
might
do
his
nature
not
to
allow
edward
the
last
triumph
of
finding
him
in
his
power
the
earl
next
essay
was
with
helen
he
feared
that
a
rumor
of
the
stranger
indignation
at
the
late
execution
and
that
the
earl
of
gloucester
had
taken
him
in
charge
might
when
associated
with
the
fact
of
the
widow
of
sir
william
wallace
still
remaining
under
his
protection
awaken
some
dangerous
suspicion
and
direct
investigations
too
likely
to
discover
the
imposition
he
had
put
on
the
executioners
of
the
last
clause
in
his
royal
father
most
iniquitous
sentence
he
therefore
explained
his
new
alarm
to
helen
and
conjured
her

remains
before
her
from
any
chance
of
violence
which
her
lingering
near
them
might
induce
by
attracting
notice
to
her
movements
she
must
consent
to
immediately
leave
the
kingdom
the
valiant
and
ever
faithful
heart
of
wallace
should
be
her
companion
and
an
english

who
had
partaken
of
his
clemency
at
berwick

trusty

by

with
strict
fidelity
till
some
safe
opportunity
may
offer
for
his
bearing
to

the
sacred
corpse
that
must
ever
be
considered
the
most
precious
relic
in
his
country
as
heaven
wills
the

of
my
heart
returned
she
so
let
it
be
and
bending
her
aching
head
on
the
dear
pillow
of
her
rest
the
bosom
which
though
cold
and
deserted
by
its
heavenly
inhabitant
was
still
the
bosom
of
her
wallace
the
ravaged
temple
rendered
sacred
by
the
footsteps
of
a
god
for
had
not
virtue
and
the
soul
of
wallace
dwelt
there
and
where
virtue
is
there
abides
the
spirit
of
the
holy
one
with
these
thoughts
she
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
vigils
and
they
were
not
less
devoutly
shared
by
the
chastened
heart
of
the
prince
of
scotland
chapter
lxxxvi
highgate
the
tidings
of
the
dreadful
vengeance
which
edward
had
taken
against
the
scottish
nation
by
pouring
all
his
wrath
upon
the
head
of
wallace
struck
like
the
lightning
of
heaven
through
the
souls
of
men
none
of
either
country
but
those
in
the
confidence
of
gloucester
knew
that
heaven
had
snatched
him
from
the
dishonor
of
so
vile
a
death
the
english
turned
blushing
from
each
other
and
ventured
not
to
breathe
the
name
of
a
man
whose
virtues
seemed
to
have
found
a
sanctuary
for
his
fame
in
every
honest
heart
but
when
the
news
reached
scotland
the
indignation
was
general
all
envyings
all
strifes
were
forgotten
in
unqualified
resentment
of
the
deed
there
was
not
a
man
even
amongst
the
late
refractory
chiefs
excepting
the
cummins
and
their
coadjutors
soulis
and
monteith
who
really
had
believed
that
edward
seriously
meant
to
sentence
the
scottish
patriot
to
a
severer
fate
than
what
he
had
pronounced
against
his
rebellious
vassal
the
exiled
baliol
the
execution
of
wallace
whose
offense
could
only
be
that
of
having
served
his
country
too
faithfully
was
therefore
so
unexpected
that
on
the
first
promulgation
of
it
so
great
an
abhorrence
of
the
perpetrator
was
excited
in
every
breast
that
the
whole
country
rose
as
one
man
threatening
to
march
instantly
to
london
and
sacrifice
the
tyrant
on
his
throne
at
this
crisis
when
the
mountains
of
the
north
seemed
heaving
from
their
base
to
overwhelm
the
fields
of
england
every
heart
which
secretly
rejoiced
in
the
late
sanguinary
event
quailed
within
its
possessor
as
it
tremblingly
anticipated
the
consequences
of
the
fall
of
wallace
at
this
instant
when
the
furies
armed
every
clan
in
scotland
breathing
forth
revenge
like
a
consuming
fire
before
them
john
cummin
the
regent
stood
aghast
he
foresaw
his
own
downfall
in
this
reawakened
enthusiasm
respecting
the
man
whom
his
treachery
had
been
the
first
means
of
betraying
to
his
enemies
baffled
in
the
aim
of
his
ambition
by
the
very
means
he
had
taken
to
effect
it
cummin
saw
no
alternative
but
to
throw
himself
at
once
upon
the
bounty
of
england
and
to
this
purpose
he
bethought
him
of
the
only
chance
of
preserving
the
power
of
past
events
that
this
tempest
of
the
soul
excited
by
remorse
in
some
and
gratitude
in
others
could
only
be
maintained
to
any
conclusive
injury
to
england
by
a
royal
hand
and
that
that
hand
was
expected
to
be
bruce
he
determined
at
once
that
the
prince
to
whom
he
had
sworn
fealty
and
to
whom
he
owed
his
present
elevation
should
follow
the
fate
of
his
friend
by
the
spies
which
he
constantly
kept
round
huntingtower
he
was
apprised
that
bruce
had
set
off
toward
london
in
a
vessel
from
dundee
on
these
grounds
he
sent
a
dispatch
to
king
edward
informing
him
that
destiny
had
established
him
supreme
lord
of
scotland
for
not
its
second
and
its
last
hope
had
put
himself
into
his
hands
with
this
intelligence
he
gave
a
particular
account
of
all
bruce
proceedings
from
the
time
of
his
meeting
wallace
in
france
to
his
present
following
the
chief
to
london
he
then
craved
his
majesty
pardon
for
having
been
betrayed
into
a
union
with
such
conspirators
and
repeating
his
hope
that
the
restitution
he
now
made
in
thus
showing
the
royal
hand
where
to
find
its
last
opponent
would
give
full
conviction
of
his
penitence
and
duty
he
closed
his
letter
by
urging
the
king
to
take
instant
and
effectual
measures
to
disable
bruce
from
disturbing
the
quiet
of
scotland
or
ever
again
disputing
his
regal
claims
gloucester
happened
to
be
in
the
presence
when
this
epistle
was
delivered
in
and
read
by
his
majesty
on
the
suit
of
his
daughter
edwin
had
been
reconciled
to
his
but
when
he
showed
him
the
contents
of
cummin
letter
with
a
suspicious
smile
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
in
case
you
should
know
this
new
rebel
presume
not
to
leave
this
room
till
he
is
brought
before
me
see
to
your
obedience
ralph
or
your
head
shall
follow
wallace
the
king
instantly
withdrew
and
the
earl
aware
that
search
would
be
made
through
all
his
houses
sought
in
his
own
mind
for
some
expedient
to
apprise
bruce
of
his
danger
to
write
in
the
was
impossible
to
deliver
a
message
in
a
whisper
would
be
hazardous
for
most
of
the
surrounding
courtiers
seeing
the
frown
with
which
the
king
had
left
the
apartment
marked
the
commands
he
gave
the
marshal
be
sure
that
the
earl
of
gloucester
quits
not
this
room
till
i
return
in
the
confusion
of
his
thoughts
the
earl
turned
his
eye
on
lord
montgomery
who
had
only
arrived
that
very
morning
from
an
embassy
to
spain
he
had
heard
with
unutterable
horror
the
fate
of
wallace
and
extending
his
interest
in
him
to
those
whom
he
loved
had
arranged
with
gloucester
to
accompany
him
that
very
evening
to
pledge
his
friendship
to
bruce
to
montgomery
then
as
to
the
only
man
acquainted
with
his
secret
he
turned
and
taking
his
spurs
off
his
feet
and
pulling
out
a
purse
of
gold
he
said
aloud
and
with
as
easy
an
air
as
he
could
assume
here
my
lord
montgomery
as
you
are
going
directly
to
highgate
i
will
thank
you
to
call
at
my
lodge
put
these
spurs
and
this
purse
into
the
hands
of
the
groom
we
spoke
of
tell
him
they
do
not
fit
me
and
he
will
know
what
use
to
make
of
them
he
then
turned
negligently
on
his
heel
and
montgomery
quitted
the
apartment
the
apprehension
of
this
young
lord
was
not
less
quick
than
the
invention
of
his
friend
he
guessed
that
the
scottish
prince
was
betrayed
and
to
render
his
escape
the
less
likely
to
be
traced
the
ground
being
wet
and
liable
to
retain
impression
before
he
went
to
the
lodge
he
dismounted
in
the
adjoining
wood
and
with
his
own
hands
reversed
the
iron
on
the
feet
of
the
animal
he
had
provided
for
bruce
he
then
proceeded
to
the
house
and
found
the
object
of
his
mission
disguised
as
a
carmelite
and
in
the
chapel
paying
his
vesper
adorations
to
the
almighty
being
on
whom
his
whole
dependence
hung
uninfluenced
by
the
robes
he
wore
his
was
the
devotion
of
the
soul
and
not
unaptly
at
such
an
hour
came
one
to
deliver
him
from
a
danger
which
unknown
to
himself
was
then
within
a
few
minutes
of
seizing
its
prey
montgomery
entered
and
being
instantly
recognized
by
bruce
the
ingenuous
prince
never
doubting
a
noble
heart
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
i
take
it
returned
the
earl
only
to
give
it
a
parting
grasp
behold
these
spurs
and
purse
sent
to
you
by
gloucester
you
know
their
use
without
further
observation
follow
me
montgomery
was
thus
abrupt
because
as
he
left
the
palace
he
had
heard
the
marshal
give
orders
for
different
military
detachments
to
search
every
residence
of
gloucester
for
the
earl
of
carrick
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
party
dispatched
to
highgate
were
now
mounting
the
hill
bruce
throwing
off
his
cassock
and
cowl
again
appeared
in
his
martial
garb
and
after
bending
his
knee
for
a
moment
on
the
which
covered
the
remains
of
wallace
he
followed
his
friend
from
the
chapel
and
thence
through
a
solitary
path
to
the
park
to
the
center
of
the
wood
montgomery
pointed
to
the
horse
bruce
grasped
the
hand
of
his
faithful
conductor
i
go
montgomery
said
he
to
my
kingdom
but
its
crown
shall
never
clasp
my
brows
till
the
remains
of
wallace
return
to
their
country
and
whether
peace
or
the
sword
restore
them
to
scotland
still
shall
a
king
a
brother
friendship
unite
my
heart
to
gloucester
and
to
you
while
speaking
he
vaulted
into
his
saddle
and
receiving
the
cordial
blessings
of
montgomery
touched
his
good
steed
with
his
pointed
rowels
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
chapter
lxxxvii
scotland
dumfries
about
the
hour
of
twilight
on
the
tenth
day
after
bruce
had
cast
his
last
look
on
the
capital
of
england
that
scene
of
his
long
captivity
under
the
spell
of
delusion
that
theater
of
his
family
disgrace
of
his
own
eternal
regrets
he
crossed
the
little
stream
which
marked
the
of
the
two
kingdoms
he
there
checked
the
headlong
speed
of
his
horse
and
having
alighted
to
give
it
breath
walked
by
its
side
musing
on
the
different
feelings
with
which
he
now
entered
scotland
from
the
buoyant
emotions
with
which
he
had
sprung
on
its
shore
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
these
thoughts
as
full
of
sorrow
as
of
hope
had
not
occupied
him
long
when
he
espied
a
man
in
the
red
cummin
colors
speeding
toward
the
south
he
guessed
him
to
be
some
new
messenger
of
the
regent
to
edward
and
throwing
himself
before
the
horse
caught
it
by
the
bridle
then
coolly
commanded
its
rider
to
deliver
to
him
the
dispatches
which
he
carried
to
the
king
of
england
the
man
refused
and
striking
his
spurs
into
his
beast
tried
to
trample
down
his
assailant
but
bruce
was
not
to
be
put
from
his
aim
the
manner
of
the
scot
convinced
him
that
his
suspicions
were
right
and
putting
forth
his
nervous
arm
with
one
action
he
pulled
the
messenger
from
his
saddle
and
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
ground
again
he
demanded
the
papers
i
am
your
prince
cried
he
and
by
the
allegiance
you
owe
to
robert
bruce
i
command
you
to
deliver
them
into
my
hands
life
shall
be
your
reward
immediate
death
the
punishment
of
your
obstinacy
in
such
an
extremity
the
man
did
not
hesitate
and
taking
from
his
bosom
a
sealed
packet
immediately
resigned
it
bruce
ordered
him
to
stand
before
him
till
he
had
read
the
contents
trembling
with
terror
of
this
formidable
freebooter
for
he
placed
no
belief
in
the
declaration
that
he
was
the
prince
of
scotland
the
man
obeyed
and
bruce
breaking
his
seals
found
as
he
expected
a
long
epistle
from
the
regent
urging
the
sanguinary
aim
of
his
communications
he
reiterated
his
arguments
for
the
expediency
of
speedily
putting
robert
bruce
to
death
he
represented
the
danger
that
there
was
in
delay
lest
a
man
so
royally
descended
and
so
popular
as
he
had
become
since
it
was
now
publicly
understood
that
he
had
already
fought
his
battles
under
the
name
of
sir
thomas
de
longueville
should
find
means
of
replacing
himself
at
the
head
of
so
many
zealots
in
his
favor
these
circumstances
so
propitious
to
ambition
and
now
adding
person
revenge
to
his
former
boldness
and
policy
would
at
this
juncture
should
he
arrive
in
scotland
turn
its
growing
commotions
to
the
most
decisive
uses
against
the
english
power
the
regent
concluded
with
saying
that
the
lords
douglas
and
ruthven
were
come
down
from
the
highlands
with
a
multitudinous
army
to
drive
out
the
southron
garrisons
and
to
repossess
themselves
of
the
fortresses
of
stirling
and
edinburgh
that
lord
bothwell
had
returned
from
france
with
the
real
sir
thomas
de
longueville
a
knight
of
great
valiancy
and
that
sir
roger
kirkpatrick
after
having
massacred
half
the
english
castellans
in
the
border
counties
was
now
lying
at
torthorald
ready
to
commence
his
murderous
reprisals
through
the
coasts
of
galloway
for
himself
cummin
told
the
kind
he
had
secretly
removed
to
the
franciscan
monastery
at
dumfries
where
he
should
most
anxiously
await
his
majesty
pardon
and
commands
bruce
closed
the
packet
to
prevent
his
discovery
being
betrayed
ere
he
was
ready
to
act
he
laid
his
sword
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
man
you
are
my
prisoner
said
he
but
fear
not
i
only
mean
to
hold
you
in
safety
till
your
master
has
answered
for
his
treason
the
messenger
thought
whoever
this
imperious
stranger
might
be
that
he
saw
a
truth
in
his
eyes
which
ratified
this
assurance
and
without
opposition
he
walked
before
him
till
they
stopped
at
torthorald
night
had
closed
in
when
bruce
sounded
his
bugle
under
the
walls
kirkpatrick
answered
from
the
embrasure
over
the
with
a
demand
of
who
desired
admittance
is
the
avenger
of
sir
william
wallace
was
the
reply
the
gates
flew
open
at
the
words
and
kirkpatrick
standing
in
the
archway
amid
a
blaze
of
torches
received
his
guest
with
a
brave
welcome
bruce
spoke
no
more
till
he
entered
the
three
other
knights
were
seated
by
the
table
he
turned
to
kirkpatrick
my
valiant
friend
said
he
order
your
servants
to
take
charge
of
yon
scot
pointing
to
the
messenger
of
cummin
and
till
i
command
his
release
let
him
be
treated
with
the
lenity
which
shall
ever
belong
to
a
prisoner
of
robert
bruce
as
he
spoke
he
threw
up
his
visor
and
kirkpatrick
who
had
heard
that
the
supposed
de
longueville
was
his
rightful
prince
now
recognized
the
features
of
the
brave
foreigner
in
the
stranger
before
him
not
doubting
the
verity
of
his
words
he
bent
his
knee
with
the
homage
due
to
his
king
and
in
the
action
was
immediately
followed
by
sir
eustace
maxwell
sir
james
lindsay
and
adam
fleming
who
were
the
other
knights
present
i
come
cried
the
prince
in
the
spirit
of
my
heart
sovereign
and
friend
the
now
immortal
wallace
to
live
or
to
die
with
you
in
the
defense
of
my
country
liberties
with
such
assistance
as
yours
his
invincible
coadjutors
and
with
the
blessing
of
heaven
on
our
arms
i
hope
to
redeem
scotland
from
the
disgrace
which
her
late
horrible
submission
to
the
tyrant
has
fastened
on
her
name
the
transgressions
of
my
house
have
been
grievous
but
that
last
deadly
sin
of
my
people
called
for
an
expiation
awful
indeed
and
it
came
in
the
moment
of
guilt
in
their
crime
they
receive
punishment
they
broke
from
their
side
the
arms
which
alone
had
rescued
them
from
their
enemies
i
now
come
to
save
them
from
themselves
their
having
permitted
the
sacrifice
of
the
rights
of
my
family
was
the
first
injury
committed
on
the
constitution
and
it
prepared
a
path
for
the
ensuing
tyranny
which
seized
upon
the
kingdom
but
by
resuming
these
rights
which
is
now
my
firm
purpose
i
open
to
you
a
way
to
recover
our
hereditary
independence
the
direful
scene
just
acted
on
the
tower
hill
of
london
that
horrible
climax
of
scottish
treason
must
convince
every
reasonable
mind
that
all
the
late
misfortunes
of
our
country
have
proceeded
from
the
base
jealousies
of
its
nobles
there
then
let
them
die
and
may
the
grave
of
wallace
be
the
tomb
of
dissension
seeing
where
their
own
true
interests
point
surely
the
brave
chieftains
of
this
land
will
rally
round
their
lawful
prince
who
here
declares
he
knows
no
medium
between
death
and
victory
the
spirit
with
which
this
address
was
pronounced
the
magnanimity
it
conveyed
assisted
by
the
graces
of
his
youth
and
noble
deportment
struck
the
hearts
of
its
auditors
and
aroused
in
double
vigor
the
principles
of
resentment
to
which
the
first
tidings
of
their
heroic
countryman
fate
had
given
birth
kirkpatrick
needed
no
other
stimulus
than
his
almost
idolatrous
memory
of
wallace
and
he
listened
with
an
answering
ardor
to
bruce
exhortation
the
prince
next
disclosed
to
his
now
friends
the
particulars
of
the
red
cummin
treachery
he
now
lies
at
dumfries
cried
kirkpatrick
thither
then
let
us
go
and
confront
him
with
his
treason
when
falsehood
is
to
be
confounded
it
is
best
to
grapple
with
the
sorceress
in
the
moment
of
detection
should
we
hesitate
she
may
elude
our
grasp
dumfries
was
only
a
few
miles
distant
and
they
might
reach
its
convent
before
the
first
matins
fatigue
was
not
felt
by
bruce
when
in
pursuit
of
a
great
object
and
after
a
slight
refreshment
he
and
his
four
determined
friends
took
horse
as
they
had
anticipated
the
midnight
bell
was
ringing
for
prayers
when
the
troop
stopped
at
the
franciscan
gate
lindsay
having
been
in
the
holy
land
during
the
late
public
struggles
alleged
business
with
the
abbot
and
desired
to
see
him
on
the
father
bidding
the
party
welcome
bruce
stepped
forward
and
addressed
him
reverend
sir
i
come
from
london
i
have
an
affair
to
settle
with
lord
badenoch
and
i
know
by
his
letters
to
king
edward
that
he
is
secretly
lodged
in
this
convent
i
therefore
command
to
be
conducted
to
him
this
peremptory
requisition
with
the
superior
air
of
the
person
who
made
it
did
not
leave
the
abbot
room
to
doubt
that
he
was
some
illustrious
messenger
from
the
king
of
england
and
with
hardly
a
demur
he
left
the
other
knights
in
the
cloisters
of
the
church
while
he
led
the
noble
southron
as
he
thought
to
his
kinsman
the
treacherous
regent
had
just
retired
from
the
refectory
to
his
own
apartment
as
the
abbot
conducted
the
stranger
into
his
presence
badenoch
started
frowningly
from
his
seat
at
such
unusual
intrusion
bruce
visor
was
closed
and
the
ecclesiastic
perceiving
the
displeasure
dispersed
it
by
announcing
the
visitant
as
a
messenger
from
king
edward
then
leave
us
together
returned
he
unwilling
that
even
this
his
convenient
kinsman
should
know
the
extent
of
his
treason
against
his
country
the
abbot
had
hardly
closed
the
door
when
bruce
whose
indignant
soul
burned
to
utter
his
full
contempt
of
the
wretch
before
him
hastily
advanced
to
speak
but
the
cautious
badenoch
fearful
that
the
father
might
yet
be
within
hearing
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
bruce
paused
and
listened
gloomily
to
the
departing
steps
of
the
abbot
when
they
were
no
more
heard
with
one
hand
raising
his
visor
and
the
other
grasping
the
scroll
of
detection
thus
basest
of
the
base
race
of
cummin
exclaimed
he
you
may
for
a
moment
elude
the
universal
shame
which
awaits
your
crimes
at
sight
of
the
fate
on
hearing
the
words
of
bruce
the
unmanly
coward
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
rushed
toward
the
door
you
pass
not
here
continued
the
prince
till
i
have
laid
open
all
your
guilt
till
i
have
laid
open
all
your
guilt
till
i
have
pronounced
you
the
doom
due
to
a
treacherous
friend
and
traitorous
subject
infatuated
bruce
exclaimed
badenoch
assuming
an
air
of
insulted
friendship
not
that
he
found
escape
impossible
what
false
tongue
has
persuaded
you
to
arraign
one
who
has
ever
been
but
too
faithfully
the
adherent
of
your
desperate
fortunes
i
have
labored
in
secret
day
and
night
in
your
service
and
thus
am
i
repaid
bruce
smiled
disdainfully
at
this
poor
attempt
to
deceive
him
and
as
he
stood
with
his
back
against
the
door
he
opened
the
murderous
packet
and
read
from
it
all
its
contents
cummin
turned
pale
and
red
at
each
sentence
and
at
last
bruce
closing
it
now
then
faithful
adherent
of
robert
bruce
cried
he
say
what
the
man
deserves
who
in
these
lines
petitions
the
death
of
his
lawful
prince
oh
thou
doth
not
my
very
look
kill
thee
badenoch
his
complexion
turning
of
a
livid
hue
and
his
voice
faltering
attempted
to
deny
the
letter
having
been
his
handwriting
or
that
he
had
any
concern
in
the
former
embassy
to
edward
then
finding
that
these
falsehoods
only
irritated
bruce
to
higher
indignation
and
fearful
of
being
immediately
sacrificed
to
his
just
resentment
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
confessing
each
transaction
implored
his
life
in
pity
to
the
natural
desire
of
which
alone
had
precipitated
him
to
so
ungrateful
a
proceeding
oh
added
he
even
this
danger
i
have
incurred
upon
your
account
for
your
ultimate
advantage
did
i
bring
on
my
head
the
perils
which
now
fill
me
with
dismay
love
alone
for
you
made
me
hasten
the
execution
of
william
wallace
that
insidious
friend
who
would
have
crept
from
your
bosom
into
your
throne
and
then
fear
of
your
mistaking
the
motives
of
so
good
a
service
betrayed
me
to
throw
myself
into
the
arms
of
edward
bury
thyself
and
crimes
thou
foulest
traitor
deep
in
the
depths
of
hell
cried
the
prince
starting
away
with
a
tremendous
gesture
out
of
my
sight
forever
that
i
may
not
pollute
these
hands
with
thy
monstrous
blood
till
this
moment
bruce
was
ignorant
that
badenoch
had
been
the
instigator
in
the
murder
of
wallace
and
forgetting
all
his
own
person
wrongs
in
this
more
mighty
injury
with
tumultuous
horror
he
turned
from
the
coward
to
avoid
the
of
stabbing
an
unarmed
wretch
at
his
feet
but
at
that
moment
cummin
who
believed
his
doom
only
suspended
rose
from
his
knee
and
drawing
his
dirk
from
under
his
plaid
struck
it
into
the
back
of
the
prince
bruce
turned
on
him
with
the
quickness
of
thought
hah
exclaimed
he
seizing
him
by
the
throat
then
take
thy
fate
this
accursed
deed
hath
removed
the
only
barrier
between
vengeance
and
thee
thus
remember
william
wallace
as
the
prince
spoke
he
plunged
his
dagger
into
the
breast
of
the
traitor
cummin
uttered
a
fearful
cry
and
rolled
down
at
his
feet
murmuring
imprecations
bruce
fled
from
the
spot
it
was
the
first
time
his
arm
had
drawn
blood
except
in
the
field
of
battle
and
he
felt
as
if
the
base
tide
had
contaminated
his
hand
in
the
cloisters
he
was
encountered
by
his
friends
a
few
words
informed
them
of
what
had
happened
is
he
dead
inquired
kirkpatrick
i
can
hardly
doubt
it
answered
bruce
such
a
matter
returned
the
veteran
must
not
be
left
to
conjecture
i
will
secure
him
and
running
forward
he
found
the
wounded
regent
crawling
from
the
door
of
the
cell
throwing
himself
upon
him
without
noise
he
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
memory
of
this
circumstance
the
crest
of
the
family
of
kirkpatrick
is
a
hand
grasping
a
dagger
distilling
gouts
of
blood
the
motto
i
mak
sikkar
before
the
catastrophe
was
known
in
the
convent
bruce
and
his
friends
had
left
it
some
time
and
were
far
on
their
road
to
lochmaben
they
arrived
before
sunrise
and
once
more
an
inmate
of
his
paternal
castle
he
thence
dispatched
fleming
to
lord
ruthven
with
a
transcript
of
his
designs
in
the
same
packed
he
inclosed
a
letter
for
the
lady
isabella
it
contained
this
brave
resolution
that
in
his
present
return
to
scotland
he
did
not
consider
himself
merely
as
robert
bruce
come
to
reclaim
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
but
as
the
executor
of
the
last
dying
will
of
sir
william
wallace
which
was
that
bruce
should
confirm
the
independence
of
scotland
or
fall
as
wallace
had
done
invincible
at
his
post
till
that
freedom
is
accomplished
continued
the
virtuous
prince
i
will
never
shake
the
steadfast
purpose
of
my
soul
by
even
once
glance
at
thy
beauties
i
am
soldier
isabella
as
he
was
heaven
and
while
my
captain
looks
on
me
from
above
shall
i
not
approve
myself
worthy
his
example
i
wooed
you
as
a
knight
i
will
win
you
as
a
king
and
on
the
day
when
no
hostile
southron
breathes
in
scotland
i
will
demand
my
sweetest
reward
my
beloved
bride
of
her
noble
uncle
you
shall
come
to
me
as
the
angel
of
peace
and
in
one
hour
we
will
receive
the
nuptial
benediction
and
the
vows
of
our
people
the
purport
of
the
prince
letter
to
ruthven
was
well
adapted
to
the
strain
of
the
foregoing
he
then
announced
his
intention
of
proceeding
immediately
to
the
plain
of
stirling
and
there
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
his
loyal
scots
declare
himself
their
lawful
sovereign
and
proclaim
to
the
world
that
he
acknowledged
no
legal
superior
but
the
great
being
whose
vicegerent
he
was
from
that
center
of
his
kingdom
he
would
make
excursions
to
its
furthest
extremities
and
with
will
either
drive
his
enemies
from
the
country
or
perish
with
the
sword
in
his
hand
as
became
the
descendant
of
william
the
lion
as
became
the
friend
of
william
wallace
ruthven
lay
encamped
on
the
carse
of
gowrie
when
this
letter
was
delivered
to
him
he
read
it
aloud
to
his
assembled
chieftains
and
with
waving
bonnets
they
hailed
the
approach
of
their
valiant
prince
bothwell
alone
whose
attachment
to
wallace
could
not
be
superseded
by
any
other
affection
allowed
his
bonnet
to
remain
inactive
in
his
hand
but
with
the
ferver
of
true
loyalty
he
thanked
god
for
thus
bringing
the
sovereign
whom
his
friend
loved
to
bind
in
one
the
contending
interests
of
his
country
to
wrest
from
the
hand
of
that
friend
assassin
the
scepter
for
which
he
had
dyed
them
so
deep
in
blood
chapter
lxxxviii
stirling
the
word
of
bruce
was
as
irreversible
as
his
spirit
was
determined
no
temptation
of
indulgence
could
seduce
him
from
the
one
no
mischance
of
adversity
could
subdue
the
other
the
standard
of
liberty
had
been
raised
by
him
on
the
carse
of
gowrie
and
he
carried
it
in
his
victorious
arm
from
east
to
west
from
the
most
northern
point
of
sutherland
to
the
walls
of
stirling
but
there
the
garrison
which
the
treason
of
the
late
regent
had
admitted
into
the
citadel
gave
a
momentary
check
to
his
career
the
english
governor
hesitated
to
surrender
on
the
terms
proposed
and
while
his
first
flag
of
truce
was
yet
in
the
tent
of
the
scottish
monarch
a
second
arrived
to
break
off
the
negotiation
whatever
were
the
reasons
for
this
abrupt
determination
bruce
paid
him
not
the
compliment
of
asking
a
wherefore
but
advancing
his
troops
to
the
southron
outposts
drove
them
in
with
great
loss
and
approaching
the
lower
works
of
the
town
by
the
road
of
ballochgeich
so
alarmed
the
governor
as
to
induce
him
to
send
forth
several
squadrons
of
horse
to
stop
his
progress
vain
was
the
attempt
they
shrunk
before
the
resolute
prince
and
his
enthusiastic
followers
the
governor
dispatched
others
and
at
last
marched
himself
out
to
their
support
no
force
seemed
able
to
withstand
the
pressing
valor
of
the
scots
the
southron
saw
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
slain
and
deserted
by
half
of
his
surviving
troops
a
surrender
both
of
himself
and
his
fainting
companions
was
now
his
only
recourse
his
herald
sounded
a
parley
the
generous
victor
in
the
midst
of
triumph
listened
to
the
offered
capitulation
it
was
not
to
include
the
citadel
of
stirling
bruce
stopped
the
herald
at
this
clause
and
at
once
demanded
the
unconditional
surrender
of
both
the
town
and
citadel
the
governor
being
aware
that
in
his
present
state
there
was
no
alternative
and
knowing
the
noble
nature
of
the
prince
who
made
the
requisition
yielded
to
necessity
and
resigned
the
whole
into
his
hands
next
morning
bruce
entered
stirling
as
a
conqueror
with
the
whole
of
his
kingdom
at
his
feet
for
from
the
solway
frith
to
the
northern
ocean
no
scottish
town
or
castle
owned
a
foreign
master
the
acclamations
of
a
rescued
people
rent
the
skies
and
while
prayers
and
blessings
poured
on
him
from
above
below
and
around
he
did
indeed
feel
himself
a
king
and
that
he
had
returned
to
the
land
of
his
forefathers
while
he
sat
on
his
proud
in
front
of
the
great
gates
of
the
citadel
now
thrown
wide
asunder
to
admit
its
rightful
sovereign
his
noble
prisoners
came
forward
they
bent
their
knees
before
him
and
delivering
their
swords
received
in
return
his
gracious
assurance
of
mercy
at
this
moment
all
scottish
hearts
and
wishes
seemed
riveted
on
their
youthful
monarch
dismounting
from
his
steed
he
raised
his
helmet
from
his
head
as
the
souls
of
his
enemies
he
raised
his
helmet
from
his
head
as
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
followed
by
all
the
ecclesiastics
in
the
town
came
forward
to
wait
upon
the
triumph
of
their
king
the
beautiful
anthem
of
the
virgins
of
israel
on
the
conquests
of
david
was
chanted
forth
by
the
nuns
who
in
this
hour
like
the
spirits
of
the
blest
revisited
the
world
to
give
the
chosen
of
their
land
all
hail
the
words
the
scene
smote
the
heart
of
bothwell
he
turned
aside
and
wept
where
were
now
the
buoyant
feelings
with
which
he
had
followed
the
similar
triumph
of
wallace
into
these
gates
buried
thou
martyred
hero
in
thy
bloody
grave
new
men
and
new
services
seemed
to
have
worn
out
remembrance
of
the
past
but
in
the
memories
of
even
this
joyous
crowd
wallace
lived
though
like
a
bright
light
which
had
passed
through
their
path
and
was
gone
never
more
to
return
on
entering
the
citadel
bruce
was
informed
by
mowbray
the
english
governor
that
he
would
find
a
lady
there
in
a
frightful
state
of
mental
derangement
and
who
might
need
his
protection
a
question
or
two
from
the
victorious
monarch
told
him
that
this
was
the
countess
of
strathearn
on
the
revolted
abthanes
having
betrayed
wallace
and
his
country
to
england
the
joy
and
ambition
of
the
countess
knew
no
bounds
and
hoping
to
eventually
persuade
edward
to
adjudge
to
her
the
crown
she
made
it
apparent
to
the
english
king
how
useful
would
be
her
services
to
scotland
while
with
a
plenary
though
secret
mission
she
took
her
course
through
her
native
land
to
discover
who
were
inimical
to
the
foreign
interest
and
who
likely
to
promote
her
own
after
this
circuit
she
fixed
her
mimic
court
at
stirling
and
living
there
in
real
magnificence
exercised
the
functions
of
a
at
this
period
intelligence
arrived
which
the
governor
thought
would
fill
her
with
exultation
and
hastening
to
declare
it
he
proclaimed
to
her
that
the
king
of
england
authority
was
now
firmly
established
in
scotland
for
that
on
the
of
august
sir
william
wallace
had
been
executed
in
london
according
to
all
the
forms
of
law
upon
the
tower
hill
on
the
full
declaration
of
this
event
she
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
that
she
recovered
to
perfect
animation
and
then
her
ravings
were
horrible
and
violent
she
accused
herself
of
the
murder
of
sir
william
wallace
she
seemed
to
hear
him
upbraid
her
with
his
fate
and
her
shrieks
and
tremendous
ejaculations
so
fearfully
presented
the
scene
of
his
death
before
the
eyes
of
her
attendants
that
her
women
fled
and
none
others
of
that
sex
would
afterward
venture
to
approach
her
in
these
fearful
moments
the
dreadful
confession
of
all
her
premeditated
guilt
of
her
infuriate
and
disappointed
passion
for
wallace
and
her
vowed
revenge
were
revealed
under
circumstances
so
shocking
that
the
english
governor
declared
to
the
king
of
scots
while
he
conducted
him
toward
her
apartment
that
he
would
rather
wear
out
his
life
in
a
rayless
dungeon
then
endure
one
hour
of
her
agonies
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
her
chamber
as
they
approached
the
door
mowbray
cautiously
opened
it
and
discovered
the
object
of
their
visit
she
was
seated
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
on
the
floor
enveloped
in
a
mass
of
scarlet
velvet
she
had
drawn
off
her
bed
her
hands
clasped
her
knees
and
she
bent
forward
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
at
which
they
entered
her
once
dazzling
beauty
was
now
transformed
to
a
haggard
glare
the
terrible
lightning
which
gleamed
on
the
face
of
satan
when
he
sat
brooding
on
the
burning
marl
of
tartarus
she
remained
motionless
as
they
advanced
but
when
bruce
stopped
directly
before
her
contemplating
with
horror
the
woman
whom
he
regarded
as
one
of
the
murderers
of
his
most
beloved
friend
she
sprung
at
once
upon
him
and
clinging
to
him
with
shrieks
buried
her
head
in
his
bosom
save
me
save
me
cried
she
mar
drags
me
down
to
hell
i
burn
there
and
yet
i
die
not
then
bursting
from
bruce
with
an
imprecation
that
froze
his
blood
she
flew
to
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
crying
aloud
thou
hast
torn
out
my
heart
fiend
i
took
thee
for
wallace
but
i
murdered
him
her
agonies
her
yells
her
attempts
at
were
now
so
dreadful
that
bruce
raising
her
bleeding
from
the
hearth
on
which
she
had
furiously
dashed
her
head
put
her
into
the
arms
of
the
men
who
attended
her
and
then
with
an
awful
sense
of
divine
retribution
left
the
apartment
chapter
lxxxix
bannockburn
the
generality
of
his
prisoners
bruce
directed
should
be
kept
safe
in
the
citadel
but
to
mobray
he
gave
his
liberty
and
ordered
every
means
to
facilitate
the
commodious
journey
of
that
brave
knight
whom
he
had
requested
to
convey
the
insane
lady
strathearn
to
the
protection
of
her
husband
mowbray
accepted
his
freedom
with
gratitude
and
gladly
set
forth
with
his
unhappy
charge
to
meet
his
sovereign
expectation
of
approach
had
been
the
reason
of
his
withdrawing
his
herald
from
the
camp
of
bruce
and
though
the
king
did
not
arrive
time
enough
to
save
stirling
mowbray
yet
hoped
he
might
still
be
continuing
his
promised
march
this
anticipation
the
southron
loyalty
would
not
allow
him
to
impart
to
bruce
and
he
bade
that
generous
prince
adieu
with
the
full
belief
of
soon
returning
to
find
him
the
vanquished
of
edward
at
the
decline
of
day
bruce
returned
to
his
camp
to
pass
the
night
in
the
field
with
his
soldiers
intending
next
morning
to
give
his
last
orders
to
the
detachments
which
he
meant
to
send
out
under
the
command
of
lennox
and
douglas
to
disperse
themselves
over
the
border
counties
and
there
keep
station
till
that
peace
should
be
signed
by
england
which
he
was
determined
by
unabated
hostilities
to
compel
having
taken
these
measures
for
the
security
of
his
kingdom
and
the
establishment
of
his
own
happiness
he
had
just
returned
to
his
tent
on
the
banks
of
the
bannockburn
when
grimsby
his
now
faithful
attendant
conducted
an
armed
knight
into
his
presence
the
light
of
the
lamp
which
stood
on
the
table
streaming
full
on
the
face
of
the
stranger
discovered
to
the
king
his
english
friend
the
intrepid
montgomery
with
an
exclamation
of
glad
surprise
bruce
would
have
clasped
him
in
his
arms
but
montgomery
dropping
on
his
knee
exclaimed
receive
a
subject
as
well
as
a
friend
victorious
and
virtuous
prince
i
have
forsworn
the
vassalage
of
the
plantagenets
and
thus
without
title
or
land
with
only
a
faithful
heart
gilbert
hambledon
comes
to
vow
himself
yours
and
scotland
forever
bruce
raised
him
from
the
ground
and
welcoming
him
with
the
warm
embrace
of
friendship
inquired
the
cause
of
so
extraordinary
an
abjuration
of
his
legal
sovereign
no
light
matter
observed
the
king
could
have
so
wrought
upon
my
noble
montgomery
montgomery
no
more
replied
the
ear
with
indignant
eagerness
when
i
threw
the
insignia
of
my
earldom
at
the
feet
of
the
unjust
edward
i
told
him
that
i
would
lay
the
saw
to
the
root
of
the
nobility
i
had
derived
from
his
house
and
cut
it
through
that
i
would
sooner
leave
my
posterity
without
titles
and
without
wealth
than
deprive
them
of
real
honor
i
have
done
as
i
said
and
yet
i
come
not
without
a
treasure
for
the
sacred
corpse
of
william
wallace
is
now
in
my
bark
floating
on
the
waves
of
the
forth
event
is
perpetuated
in
the
crest
of
the
noble
family
of
hamilton
in
scotland
the
subjugation
of
england
would
hardly
have
been
so
welcome
to
bruce
as
this
intelligence
he
received
it
with
an
eloquent
though
unutterable
look
of
gratitude
hambledon
continued
on
the
tyrant
summoning
the
peers
of
england
to
follow
him
to
the
destruction
of
scotland
gloucester
got
excused
under
a
plea
of
illness
and
i
could
not
but
show
a
disinclination
to
obey
this
occasioned
some
remarks
from
edward
respecting
my
known
attachment
to
the
scottish
cause
and
they
were
so
couched
as
to
draw
from
me
this
honest
answer
my
heart
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
the
world
permit
me
to
join
in
the
projected
invasion
since
i
had
seen
the
spot
in
my
own
country
where
a
most
inordinate
ambition
had
cut
down
the
flower
of
all
knighthood
because
he
was
a
scot
who
would
not
sell
his
birthright
the
king
left
me
in
wrath
and
threatened
to
make
me
recant
my
words
i
as
proudly
declared
i
would
maintain
them
next
morning
being
in
waiting
on
the
prince
i
entered
his
chamber
and
found
john
le
de
spencer
the
coward
who
so
basely
insulted
wallace
on
the
day
of
his
condemnation
he
was
sitting
with
his
highness
on
my
offering
the
services
due
from
my
office
this
worthless
minion
turned
on
me
and
accused
me
of
having
declined
joining
the
army
for
the
sole
purpose
of
executing
some
plot
in
london
devised
between
me
and
my
scottish
partisans
for
the
subversion
of
the
english
monarchy
i
denied
the
charge
he
enforced
it
with
oaths
and
i
spurned
his
allegations
the
prince
who
believed
him
furiously
gave
me
the
lie
and
commanded
me
as
a
traitor
to
leave
his
presence
i
refused
to
stir
an
inch
till
i
made
the
base
heart
of
le
de
spencer
retract
his
falsehood
the
coward
took
courage
on
his
master
support
and
drawing
his
sword
upon
me
in
language
that
would
blister
my
tongue
to
repeat
threatened
to
compel
my
departure
he
struck
me
on
the
face
with
his
weapon
the
arms
of
his
prince
could
not
then
save
him
i
thrust
him
through
the
body
and
he
fell
edward
ran
on
me
with
his
dagger
but
i
wrested
it
from
him
then
it
was
that
i
reply
to
his
menaces
i
revoked
my
fealty
to
a
sovereign
i
abhorred
a
prince
i
despised
leaving
his
presence
before
the
fluctuations
of
so
versatile
a
mind
could
fix
upon
seizing
me
i
hastened
to
highgate
to
convey
away
the
body
of
our
friend
from
its
brief
sanctuary
the
same
night
i
embarked
it
and
myself
on
board
a
ship
of
my
own
and
am
now
at
your
feet
brave
and
just
king
no
longer
montgomery
but
a
true
scot
in
heart
and
loyalty
and
as
a
kinsman
generous
hambledon
returned
bruce
i
receive
and
will
portion
thee
my
paternal
lands
of
cadzow
on
the
clyde
shall
be
thine
forever
and
may
thy
posterity
be
as
worthy
of
the
inheritance
as
their
ancestor
is
of
all
my
love
and
confidence
hambledon
having
received
his
new
sovereign
directions
concerning
the
disembarkation
of
those
sacred
remains
which
the
young
king
declared
he
should
welcome
as
the
pledge
of
heaven
to
bless
his
victories
with
peace
returned
to
the
haven
where
wallace
rested
in
that
sleep
which
even
the
voice
of
friendship
could
not
disturb
at
the
hour
of
the
midnight
watch
the
trumpets
of
approaching
heralds
resounded
without
the
camp
bruce
hastened
to
the
to
receive
the
now
anticipated
tidings
the
communications
of
hambledon
had
given
him
reason
to
expect
another
struggle
for
his
kingdom
and
the
message
of
the
trumpets
declared
it
might
be
a
mortal
one
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
edward
had
forced
a
rapid
passage
through
the
lowlands
and
was
now
within
a
few
hours
march
of
stirling
fully
determined
to
bury
scotland
under
her
own
slain
or
by
one
decisive
blow
restore
her
to
his
empire
when
this
was
uttered
by
the
english
herald
bruce
turned
to
ruthven
with
an
heroic
smile
let
him
come
my
brave
barons
and
he
shall
find
that
bannockburn
shall
page
with
the
strength
of
the
scottish
army
did
not
amount
to
more
than
thirty
thousand
men
against
this
host
of
southrons
but
the
relics
of
wallace
were
there
his
spirit
glowed
in
the
heart
of
bruce
the
young
monarch
lost
not
the
advantage
of
choosing
his
ground
first
and
therefore
as
his
power
was
deficient
in
cavalry
he
so
took
his
field
as
to
compel
the
enemy
to
make
it
a
battle
of
infantry
alone
to
protect
his
exposed
flank
from
the
innumerable
squadrons
of
edward
he
dug
deep
and
wide
pits
near
to
bannockburn
and
having
overlaid
their
mouths
with
turf
and
brushwood
proceeded
to
marshal
his
little
phalanx
on
the
shore
of
that
brook
till
his
front
stretched
to
ninan
monastery
the
center
was
led
by
lord
ruthven
and
walter
stewart
the
right
owned
by
the
valiant
leading
of
douglas
and
ramsay
supported
by
the
brave
young
gordon
with
all
his
clan
and
the
left
was
put
in
charge
of
lennox
with
sir
thomas
randolph
a
crusade
chieftain
who
like
lindsay
and
others
had
lately
returned
from
distant
lands
and
now
zealously
embraced
the
cause
of
his
country
bruce
stationed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
reserve
with
him
were
the
veterans
and
kirkpatrick
and
lord
bothwell
with
the
true
de
longueville
and
the
men
of
lanark
all
determined
to
make
this
division
the
stay
of
their
little
army
or
the
last
sacrifice
for
scottish
liberty
and
its
martyred
champion
corpse
there
stood
the
sable
hearse
of
wallace
rather
than
yield
the
ground
which
he
had
rendered
doubly
precious
by
having
made
it
the
scene
and
the
guerdon
of
his
invincible
deeds
when
kirkpatrick
approached
the
side
of
his
dead
chief
he
burst
into
tears
and
his
sobs
alone
proclaimed
his
participation
in
the
solemnity
the
vow
spread
to
the
surrounding
legions
and
was
echoed
with
mingled
cries
and
acclamations
from
the
furthest
ranks
my
leader
in
death
as
in
life
exclaimed
bruce
clasping
his
friend
sable
shroud
to
his
heart
thy
pale
corpse
shall
again
redeem
the
country
which
cast
thee
living
amongst
devouring
lions
its
presence
shall
fight
and
conquer
for
thy
friend
and
king
before
the
chiefs
turned
to
resume
their
martial
stations
the
abbot
of
inchaffray
drew
near
with
the
mysterious
iron
box
which
douglas
had
caused
to
be
brought
from
fillan
priory
on
presenting
it
to
the
young
monarch
he
repeated
the
prohibition
which
had
been
given
with
it
and
added
since
then
these
canonized
relics
for
none
can
doubt
they
are
so
have
found
protection
under
the
no
less
holy
arm
of
fillan
he
now
delivers
them
to
your
youthful
majesty
to
penetrate
their
secrets
and
to
nerve
your
mind
with
redoubled
trust
in
the
saintly
host
the
saints
are
to
be
honored
reverend
father
and
on
that
principle
i
shall
not
invade
their
mysteries
till
the
god
in
whom
alone
i
trust
marks
me
with
more
than
the
name
of
king
till
by
a
decisive
victory
he
establishes
me
the
approved
champion
of
my
country
the
worthy
successor
of
him
before
whose
mortal
body
and
immortal
spirit
i
now
emulate
his
deeds
but
as
a
memorial
that
the
host
of
heaven
do
indeed
learn
from
the
bright
abodes
to
wish
well
to
this
day
let
these
holy
relics
repose
with
those
of
the
brave
till
the
issue
of
the
battle
bruce
having
placed
his
array
disposed
the
supernumeraries
of
his
army
the
families
of
his
soldiers
and
other
apparently
useless
followers
of
the
camp
in
the
rear
of
an
adjoining
hill
by
daybreak
the
whole
of
the
southron
army
came
in
view
the
van
consisting
of
archers
and
displayed
the
banner
of
earl
de
warenne
the
main
body
was
led
on
by
edward
himself
supported
by
a
train
of
his
most
redoubted
generals
as
they
approached
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
stood
on
the
face
of
the
opposite
hill
between
the
abbots
of
and
inchaffray
celebrating
mass
in
the
sight
of
the
opposing
armies
he
passed
along
in
front
of
the
scottish
lines
barefoot
with
the
crucifix
in
his
hand
and
in
few
but
forcible
words
exhorted
them
by
every
sacred
hope
to
fight
with
an
unreceding
step
for
their
rights
their
king
and
the
corpse
of
william
wallace
at
this
abjuration
which
seemed
the
call
of
heaven
itself
the
scots
fell
on
their
knees
to
confirm
their
resolution
with
a
vow
the
sudden
humiliation
of
their
posture
excited
an
instant
triumph
in
the
haughty
mind
of
edward
and
spurring
forward
he
shouted
aloud
they
yield
they
cry
for
mercy
they
cry
for
mercy
returned
percy
trying
to
withhold
his
majesty
but
not
from
us
on
that
ground
on
which
they
kneel
they
will
be
victorious
or
find
their
graves
the
king
contemned
this
opinion
of
the
earl
and
inwardly
believing
that
now
wallace
was
dead
he
need
fear
no
other
opponent
for
he
knew
not
that
even
his
cold
remains
were
risen
in
array
against
him
he
ordered
his
men
to
charge
the
horsemen
to
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
obeyed
and
rushing
forward
with
the
hope
of
overwhelming
the
scots
ere
they
could
rise
from
their
knees
met
a
different
destiny
they
found
destruction
amid
the
trenches
and
on
the
pikes
in
the
way
and
with
broken
ranks
and
fearful
confusion
fell
or
fled
under
the
missive
weapons
which
poured
on
them
from
a
neighboring
hill
de
valence
was
overthrown
and
severely
wounded
and
being
carried
off
the
field
filled
the
rear
ranks
with
dismay
while
the
king
division
was
struck
with
consternation
at
so
disastrous
a
commencement
of
an
action
in
which
they
had
promised
themselves
so
easy
a
victory
bruce
seized
the
moment
of
confusion
and
seeing
his
little
army
distressed
by
the
arrows
of
the
english
he
sent
bothwell
round
with
a
resolute
body
of
men
to
drive
those
destroying
archers
from
the
heights
which
they
occupied
this
was
effected
and
bruce
coming
up
with
his
reserve
the
battle
in
the
center
became
close
obstinate
and
decisive
many
fell
before
the
determined
arm
of
the
youthful
king
but
it
was
the
fortune
of
bothwell
to
encounter
the
false
monteith
in
the
train
of
edward
the
scottish
earl
was
then
at
the
head
of
his
intrepid
lanarkmen
fiend
of
the
most
damned
treason
cried
he
vengeance
is
come
and
with
an
iron
grasp
throwing
the
traitor
into
the
midst
of
the
faithful
clan
they
dragged
him
to
the
hearse
of
their
chief
and
there
on
the
skirts
of
its
pall
the
wretched
villain
breathed
out
his
treacherous
breath
under
the
strokes
of
a
hundred
swords
so
cried
the
veteran
ireland
perish
the
murderers
of
william
wallace
so
shouted
the
rest
perish
the
enemies
of
the
bravest
the
most
loyal
of
scots
the
benefactor
of
his
country
at
this
crisis
the
women
and
followers
of
the
scottish
camp
hearing
such
triumphant
exclamations
from
their
friends
impatiently
quitted
their
station
behind
the
hill
and
ran
to
the
summit
waving
their
scarfs
and
plaids
in
exultation
of
the
supposed
victory
the
english
mistaking
these
people
for
a
new
army
had
not
the
power
to
recover
from
the
increasing
confusion
which
had
seized
them
on
king
edward
himself
receiving
a
wound
and
with
the
sight
of
their
generals
falling
around
them
they
flung
down
their
arms
and
fled
the
king
narrowly
escaped
but
being
mounted
on
a
stout
and
fleet
horse
he
put
him
to
the
speed
and
reached
dunbar
whence
the
young
earl
of
march
being
as
much
attached
to
the
cause
of
england
as
his
father
had
been
instantly
gave
him
a
passage
to
england
the
southron
camp
with
all
its
riches
fell
into
the
hands
of
bruce
but
while
his
chieftains
pursued
their
gallant
chase
he
turned
his
steps
from
warlike
triumph
to
pay
his
heart
honors
to
the
remains
of
the
hero
whose
blood
had
so
often
bathed
scotland
fields
of
victory
his
vigils
were
again
beneath
that
sacred
pall
for
so
long
had
been
the
conflict
that
night
closed
in
before
the
last
squadrons
left
the
banks
of
bannockburn
at
the
dewy
hour
of
morn
bruce
reappeared
upon
the
field
his
helmet
was
royally
plumed
and
the
golden
lion
of
scotland
gleamed
from
under
his
sable
surcoat
bothwell
rode
at
his
side
the
troops
he
had
retained
from
the
pursuit
were
drawn
out
in
array
in
a
brief
address
he
unfolded
to
them
the
solemn
duty
to
which
he
had
called
them
to
see
the
bosom
of
their
native
land
receive
the
remains
of
sir
william
wallace
he
gave
to
you
your
homes
and
your
liberty
grant
then
a
grave
the
peace
of
the
tomb
to
him
whom
some
amongst
you
repaid
with
treachery
and
death
at
these
words
a
cry
as
if
they
beheld
their
betrayed
chief
slain
before
them
issued
from
every
heart
the
news
had
spread
to
the
town
and
with
tears
and
lamentations
a
vast
crowd
collected
round
the
royal
troop
bruce
ordered
his
bards
to
raise
the
sad
coronach
and
the
march
commenced
toward
the
open
tent
that
canopied
the
sacred
remains
the
whole
train
followed
the
speechless
woe
as
if
each
individual
had
lost
his
dearest
relative
having
passed
the
wood
they
came
in
view
of
the
black
hearse
which
contained
all
that
now
remained
of
him
who
had
so
lately
crossed
these
precincts
in
all
the
panoply
of
triumphant
war
in
all
the
graciousness
of
peace
and
love
to
man
the
soldiers
the
people
rushed
forward
and
precipitating
themselves
before
the
bier
implored
a
pardon
for
their
ungrateful
country
they
adjured
him
by
every
tender
name
of
father
benefactor
and
friend
and
in
such
a
sacred
presence
forgetting
that
their
king
was
by
gave
way
to
a
grief
which
most
eloquently
told
the
young
monarch
that
he
who
would
be
respected
after
william
wallace
must
not
only
possess
his
power
and
valor
but
imitate
his
virtues
scrymgeour
who
had
well
remembered
his
promise
to
wallace
on
the
battlements
of
dumbarton
with
a
holy
reference
to
that
vow
now
laid
the
standard
of
scotland
upon
the
pall
hambledon
placed
on
it
the
sword
and
helmet
of
the
sacrificed
hero
bruce
observed
all
in
silence
the
sacred
burden
was
raised
uncovering
his
royal
head
with
his
kingly
purple
sweeping
in
the
dust
he
walked
before
the
bier
shedding
tears
more
precious
in
the
eyes
of
his
subjects
than
the
oil
which
was
soon
to
pour
upon
his
brow
as
he
thus
moved
on
he
heard
acclamations
mingle
with
the
voice
of
sorrow
this
is
our
king
worthy
to
have
been
the
friend
of
wallace
worthy
to
succeed
him
in
the
kingdom
of
our
hearts
at
the
gates
of
the
venerable
abbot
appeared
at
the
head
of
his
religious
brethren
but
without
uttering
the
grief
that
shook
his
aged
frame
he
raised
the
golden
crucifix
over
the
head
of
the
bier
and
after
leaning
his
face
for
a
few
minutes
on
it
preceded
the
procession
into
the
church
none
but
the
soldiers
entered
the
people
remained
without
and
as
the
doors
closed
they
fell
on
the
pavement
weeping
as
if
the
living
wallace
had
again
been
torn
from
them
on
the
steps
of
the
altar
the
bier
rested
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
in
his
pontifical
robes
received
the
sacred
deposit
with
a
cloud
of
incense
and
the
pealing
organ
answered
by
the
voices
of
the
choristers
breathed
the
solemn
requiem
of
the
dead
the
wreathing
frankincense
parted
its
vapor
and
a
wan
but
beautiful
form
clasping
an
urn
to
her
breast
appeared
stretched
on
a
litter
and
was
borne
toward
the
spot
it
was
helen
brought
from
the
adjoining
nunnery
where
since
her
return
to
these
once
dear
shores
now
made
a
desert
to
her
she
had
languished
in
the
gradual
decay
of
the
fragile
bonds
which
alone
fettered
her
mourning
spirit
eager
for
release
all
night
had
isabella
watched
by
her
couch
expecting
that
each
succeeding
breath
would
be
the
last
her
beloved
sister
would
draw
in
this
calamitous
world
but
as
her
tears
fell
in
silence
from
her
cheek
upon
the
cold
forehead
of
helen
the
gentle
saint
understood
their
expression
and
looking
up
my
isabella
said
she
fear
not
my
wallace
is
returned
god
will
grant
me
life
to
clasp
his
blessed
remains
full
of
this
hope
she
was
borne
almost
a
passing
spirit
into
the
chancel
of
her
veil
was
open
and
discovered
her
face
like
one
just
awakened
from
the
dead
it
was
ashy
pale
but
it
bore
a
celestial
brightness
which
like
the
silver
luster
of
the
moon
declared
its
approach
to
the
fountain
of
its
glory
her
eye
fell
on
the
bier
and
with
a
momentary
strength
she
sprung
from
the
couch
on
which
she
had
leaned
in
dying
feebleness
and
threw
herself
upon
the
coffin
there
was
an
awful
pause
while
helen
seemed
to
weep
but
so
was
not
her
sorrow
to
be
shed
it
was
locked
within
the
of
her
heart
in
that
suspension
of
the
soul
when
bothwell
knelt
on
one
side
of
the
bier
and
ruthven
bent
his
knee
on
the
other
bruce
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
weeping
isabella
come
hither
my
youthful
bride
and
let
thy
first
duty
be
paid
to
the
shrine
of
thy
benefactor
and
mine
so
may
we
live
sweet
excellence
and
so
may
we
die
if
the
like
may
be
our
meed
of
heavenly
glory
isabella
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
wept
aloud
helen
slowly
raising
her
head
at
these
words
regarded
her
sister
with
a
look
of
awful
tenderness
then
turning
her
eyes
back
upon
the
coffin
gazed
on
it
as
if
they
would
have
pierced
its
confines
and
clasping
the
urn
earnestly
to
her
heart
she
exclaimed
is
come
the
promise
thy
bridal
bed
shall
be
william
wallace
grave
bruce
and
isabella
not
aware
that
she
repeated
words
which
wallace
had
said
to
her
turned
to
her
with
portentous
emotion
she
understood
the
terrified
glance
of
her
sister
and
with
a
smile
which
bespoke
her
kindred
to
the
soul
she
was
panting
to
rejoin
she
answered
i
speak
of
my
own
espousals
but
ere
that
moment
is
and
i
feel
it
near
let
my
wallace
hallowed
presence
bless
your
nuptials
thou
wilt
breathe
thy
benediction
through
my
lips
added
she
laying
her
hand
on
the
coffin
and
looking
down
on
it
as
if
she
were
conversing
with
its
inhabitant
o
no
no
returned
isabella
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
the
almost
unembodied
aspect
of
her
sister
let
me
ever
be
the
sharer
of
your
cell
or
take
me
with
you
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
is
thy
sister
spirit
that
speaks
cried
dunkeld
observing
the
awe
which
not
only
shook
the
tender
frame
of
isabella
but
had
communicated
itself
to
bruce
who
stood
in
veneration
before
the
yet
unascended
angel
holy
inspiration
continued
the
bishop
beams
from
her
eyes
and
as
ye
hope
for
further
blessings
obey
its
dictates
isabella
bowed
her
head
in
acquiescence
as
bruce
approached
to
take
his
part
in
the
sacred
rite
he
raised
the
hand
which
lay
on
the
pall
to
his
lips
the
ceremony
began
was
finished
as
the
bridal
notes
resounded
from
the
organ
and
the
royal
pair
rose
from
their
knees
helen
held
her
trembling
hands
over
them
she
gasped
for
breath
and
would
have
sunk
without
a
word
had
not
bothwell
supported
her
shadowy
form
upon
his
breast
she
looked
round
on
him
with
a
grateful
though
languid
smile
and
with
a
strong
effort
spoke
be
you
blessed
in
all
things
as
wallace
would
have
blessed
you
from
his
side
i
pour
out
my
soul
upon
you
my
sister
my
being
and
with
its
prayers
to
the
giver
of
all
good
for
your
eternal
happiness
i
turn
in
holy
faith
to
my
long
rest
bruce
and
isabella
wept
in
each
other
arms
helen
slid
gently
from
the
boom
of
bothwell
prostrate
on
the
coffin
and
uttering
in
a
low
tone
i
waited
only
for
this
we
have
met
i
unite
thy
noble
heart
to
thee
again
i
claim
my
brother
at
our
father
hands
in
mercy
in
love
by
his
son
her
voice
gradually
faded
away
as
she
murmured
these
broken
sentences
which
none
but
the
close
and
attentive
ear
of
bothwell
heard
but
he
caught
not
the
triumphant
exclamation
of
her
soul
which
spoke
though
her
lips
ceased
to
move
and
cried
to
the
attending
angels
death
where
is
thy
sting
grave
where
is
thy
victory
in
this
awful
moment
the
abbot
of
inchaffray
believing
the
dying
saint
was
prostrate
in
prayer
laid
his
hand
on
the
iron
box
which
stood
at
the
foot
of
wallace
bier
before
the
sacred
remains
of
the
once
champion
of
scotland
and
in
the
presence
of
his
royal
successor
exclaimed
the
abbot
let
this
mysterious
coffer
of
fillan
be
opened
to
reward
the
deliverer
of
scotland
according
to
its
intent
if
it
were
to
contain
the
relics
of
fillan
himself
returned
the
king
they
could
not
meet
a
holier
bosom
than
this
and
resting
the
box
on
the
coffin
he
unclasped
the
lock
and
the
regalia
of
scotland
was
discovered
at
this
sight
bruce
exclaimed
in
an
agony
of
grateful
emotion
thus
did
this
truest
of
human
beings
protect
my
rights
even
while
the
people
i
had
deserted
and
whom
he
had
saved
knelt
to
him
to
wear
them
all
and
thus
wallace
crowns
thee
said
dunkeld
taking
the
diadem
from
its
coffer
and
setting
it
on
bruce
head
my
husband
and
my
king
gently
exclaimed
isabella
sinking
on
her
knee
before
him
and
clasping
his
hand
to
her
lips
hearest
thou
that
my
beloved
helen
cried
bothwell
touching
the
clasped
hands
which
rested
on
the
coffin
he
turned
pale
and
looked
on
bruce
bruce
in
the
glad
moment
of
his
joy
at
this
happy
consummation
of
so
many
years
of
blood
observed
not
his
glance
but
in
exulting
accents
exclaimed
look
up
my
sister
and
let
thy
soul
discoursing
with
our
wallace
tell
him
that
scotland
is
free
and
bruce
king
indeed
she
spoke
not
she
moved
not
bothwell
raised
her
face
that
soul
has
fled
my
lord
said
he
but
from
yon
eternal
sphere
they
now
together
look
upon
your
joys
here
let
their
bodies
rest
for
loved
in
their
lives
and
in
their
deaths
they
shall
not
be
divided
before
the
renewing
of
the
moon
whose
waning
light
witnessed
their
solemn
obsequies
the
aim
of
wallace
life
the
object
of
prayers
was
accomplished
peace
reigned
in
scotland
the
discomfited
king
edward
died
of
chagrin
in
carlisle
and
his
humbled
son
and
successor
sent
to
offer
such
honorable
terms
of
pacification
that
bruce
gave
them
acceptance
and
a
lasting
tranquility
spread
prosperity
and
happiness
throughout
the
land
appendix
note
respecting
the
personal
conformation
of
sir
william
wallace
and
king
robert
bruce
the
extraordinary
bodily
as
well
as
mental
superiority
which
wallace
and
bruce
possessed
over
their
contemporaries
is
thus
recorded
by
hector
boetius
about
the
latter
end
of
the
year
king
james
i
of
scotland
on
returning
to
perth
from
andrews
found
his
curiosity
excited
to
visit
a
very
old
lady
of
the
house
of
erskine
who
resided
in
the
castle
of
kinnoul
in
consequence
of
her
extreme
old
age
she
had
lost
her
sight
but
all
her
other
senses
were
entire
and
her
body
was
yet
firm
and
active
she
had
seen
william
wallace
and
robert
bruce
in
her
earliest
youth
and
frequently
told
particulars
of
them
the
king
who
entertained
a
love
and
veneration
for
great
men
resolved
to
visit
the
old
lady
that
he
might
hear
her
describe
the
manners
and
strength
of
the
two
heroes
he
therefore
sent
a
message
acquainting
her
that
he
would
come
to
her
the
next
day
when
she
was
told
that
the
king
was
approaching
she
went
down
into
the
hall
of
her
castle
attended
by
a
train
of
matrons
many
of
whom
were
her
own
descendants
she
advanced
to
meet
his
majesty
so
easily
and
gracefully
that
he
doubted
her
being
blind
at
his
desire
she
embraced
and
kissed
him
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
made
her
sit
down
on
the
seat
next
to
him
and
then
in
a
long
conference
he
interrogated
her
on
ancient
matters
among
others
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
what
sort
of
a
man
william
wallace
was
what
was
his
personal
figure
what
his
bearing
and
with
what
degree
of
strength
he
was
endowed
he
put
the
same
comparing
question
to
her
concerning
robert
bruce
said
she
a
man
beautiful
and
of
fine
appearance
his
strength
was
so
great
that
he
could
easily
have
overcome
any
mortal
man
of
his
time
save
one
sir
william
wallace
but
in
so
far
as
he
excelled
other
men
he
was
excelled
by
wallace
both
in
stature
and
in
bodily
strength
for
in
wrestling
wallace
could
have
overthrown
two
such
men
as
robert
and
he
was
comely
as
well
as
strong
and
full
of
the
beauty
of
wisdom
i
might
have
thought
had
i
known
the
above
record
in
my
young
days
when
i
heard
my
old
friend
luckie
forbes
describe
the
scottish
heroes
that
she
must
have
been
one
of
those
matrons
of
honor
to
lady
kinnoul
and
had
seen
baith
the
stalwarth
chiefs
in
her
also
venerable
life
but
the
description
of
my
humble
historiographer
was
the
work
of
her
own
heart
suggested
there
by
tradition
and
a
holy
reverence
of
even
the
name
of
william
wallace
to
help
it
out
and
so
my
pen
moved
by
the
same
impulse
has
attempted
to
copy
the
picture
she
presented
note
concerning
joanna
of
mar
and
strathearn
this
unhappy
and
wicked
woman
descendance
as
daughter
of
a
princess
of
the
orkneys
and
her
husband
mellis
earl
of
strathearn
is
given
in
all
the
old
scottish
genealogical
words
and
her
marriage
with
earl
de
warenne
followed
up
by
her
most
unnatural
treasons
against
her
native
country
are
not
less
faithfully
recorded
but
it
is
something
curious
that
while
revising
this
volume
a
few
years
ago
i
met
a
paragraph
in
the
morning
post
newspaper
relative
to
this
very
lady
now
dead
upward
of
five
hundred
years
and
dated
august
almost
the
very
of
sir
william
wallace
death
it
was
an
extract
from
the
perth
courier
and
runs
thus
in
preparing
the
foundation
of
the
classical
monument
which
lady
baird
is
about
to
erect
on
to
the
memory
of
sir
david
the
workmen
discovered
the
remains
of
an
extensive
edifice
intermixed
with
a
blackish
mold
in
which
human
bones
frequently
occur
with
stirrups
buckles
and
other
decayed
fragments
of
ancient
armor
in
an
excavation
were
found
a
quantity
of
black
earth
the
debris
of
animal
matter
some
human
bones
a
bracelet
and
a
considerable
portion
of
charcoal
from
which
it
may
be
concluded
that
the
individuals
whose
remains
were
discovered
had
perished
during
a
conflagration
of
the
castle
the
tradition
of
the
country
is
that
three
ladies
had
been
there
burned
to
death
and
as
it
is
known
that
the
lady
of
strathearn
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
orkney
involved
herself
in
the
quarrels
between
bruce
and
baliol
and
was
after
the
ascendency
of
the
former
in
a
parliament
held
at
scone
in
doomed
to
perpetual
imprisonment
for
the
crime
of
laesoe
majestatis
it
is
no
violent
stretch
of
conjecture
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
very
lady
may
have
been
one
of
the
unhappy
victims
whose
remains
have
been
thus
accidentally
brought
to
light
the
excavation
undoubtedly
being
the
most
probably
supposition
was
that
usually
found
in
the
base
of
the
of
the
castle
on
the
summit
of
which
sir
david
monument
is
to
be
placed
overlooks
the
whole
strath
and
is
even
visible
from
dundee
so
far
the
note
from
the
perth
newspaper
which
was
first
appended
to
this
almost
veritable
romance
biography
of
sir
william
wallace
in
the
edition
of
and
on
comparing
the
circumstances
and
dates
of
the
period
referred
to
it
does
not
seem
improbable
that
such
might
have
been
the
fearful
end
of
that
ambitious
and
cruelly
impassioned
woman
earl
de
warenne
was
not
a
man
to
burden
himself
with
cares
for
such
a
partner
after
her
treasons
had
become
abortive
in
the
secret
continuance
of
which
most
likely
she
had
been
discovered
in
some
of
her
territorial
permitted
visits
to
her
inherited
lands
in
scotland
and
the
relics
of
the
other
two
female
forms
found
in
the
ashes
may
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
been
those
of
her
personal
attendants
sharing
her
captivity
the
above
coincidence
of
recollections
between
the
far
past
and
the
present
nearly
but
passing
events
may
be
regarded
as
rather
remarkable
for
the
hill
of
may
now
be
looked
upon
as
an
object
recalling
to
memory
of
two
heroes
one
scotland
noblest
son
of
full
five
hundred
ages
gone
the
other
her
boast
on
the
plains
of
india
within
our
own
remembrance
while
the
same
summit
brings
two
of
her
daughters
likewise
to
eminent
recollection
one
that
disgraced
her
sex
in
every
relation
of
life
the
other
who
honors
it
in
all
the
hand
of
the
first
would
have
destroyed
her
country
greatest
hero
the
hand
of
the
second
raised
a
tumulus
to
maintain
the
memory
and
the
example
of
such
true
sons
of
her
country
in
a
perpetual
existence
the
scarf
of
james
the
fifth
of
scotland
in
the
possession
of
jefferson
of
west
lodge
clapham
this
scarf
belonged
to
and
was
worn
by
the
truly
royal
but
something
romantically
adventurous
king
of
scotland
james
the
fifth
he
was
fond
of
roaming
about
in
his
dominions
like
the
celebrated
haroun
al
rashid
in
various
disguises
to
see
and
to
observe
and
to
make
acquaintance
with
his
people
of
all
degrees
without
being
known
by
them
in
one
of
these
incognito
wanderings
about
the
year
he
was
hospitably
entertained
for
a
night
by
an
ancestor
of
jefferson
lady
a
man
of
liberal
name
in
the
country
and
who
unwittingly
had
given
most
courteous
bed
and
board
to
his
sovereign
then
personally
unknown
to
him
when
he
thought
he
was
entertaining
a
person
not
much
above
the
rank
of
the
commonest
degree
it
being
the
monarch
humor
generally
to
assume
the
most
ordinary
garb
outwardly
and
it
therefore
depended
on
the
tact
of
the
entertainer
from
his
own
inherent
nobleness
to
discern
the
real
quality
of
the
mind
and
manners
of
his
transitory
guest
the
host
in
question
did
not
discern
that
it
was
his
sovereign
he
was
then
treating
like
a
prince
but
he
felt
it
was
a
visitant
be
he
whom
he
may
that
was
worthy
his
utmost
respect
and
the
monarch
highly
pleased
with
his
night
lodging
and
previous
gracious
welcome
on
his
departure
next
morning
presented
to
the
lady
of
the
mansion
a
grateful
tribute
to
her
good
care
in
the
form
of
a
small
parcel
rolled
up
which
when
opened
they
found
to
be
a
splendid
scarf
indorsed
to
herself
and
lord
in
the
name
of
the
gudemon
ballangeich
all
then
knew
it
was
the
generous
and
pleasant
king
of
scotland
who
had
been
their
guest
the
scottish
chief
on
whom
this
beautiful
memorial
of
received
hospitality
had
been
bestowed
was
john
baird
of
burntisland
in
fifeshire
from
whom
the
writer
of
this
note
literally
traces
the
present
inheritance
of
the
scarf
john
burgh
had
an
only
daughter
who
married
john
balfour
who
also
had
an
only
daughter
and
she
married
gilbert
blair
brother
to
blair
of
their
only
son
james
blair
married
jane
morrison
daughter
of
morrison
and
an
heiress
of
the
brave
house
of
ramsay
by
which
marriage
the
ancient
and
honorable
families
of
burgh
blair
and
ramsay
were
woven
into
one
branch
and
from
this
branch
indeed
from
the
first
of
its
united
stem
was
born
of
this
marriage
margaret
blair
who
dying
in
the
year
bequeathed
the
scarf
to
jefferson
the
worthy
husband
of
her
beloved
kinswoman
direct
in
the
line
of
john
burgh
to
whom
it
had
originally
been
given
the
scarf
was
composed
of
a
rich
and
brilliant
tissue
of
gold
and
silver
threads
interwoven
with
flowers
in
their
natural
colors
they
are
chiefly
pansies
the
emblems
of
remembrance
thistles
the
old
insignia
of
scotland
and
the
field
daisy
the
favorite
symbol
of
king
james
mother
the
beautiful
queen
margaret
the
flowers
entwined
together
run
in
stripes
down
the
splendid
web
of
the
scarf
which
terminates
at
each
end
with
what
has
been
a
magnificent
fringe
of
similar
hues
and
brightness
the
scarf
is
seven
feet
in
length
by
one
foot
nine
inches
in
width
this
interesting
bequest
was
still
further
enriched
to
jefferson
by
the
addition
of
a
cap
and
gloves
which
tradition
says
the
worthy
chief
of
burntisland
wore
on
his
nuptial
day
there
was
also
a
smaller
pair
of
gloves
of
a
more
delicate
size
and
texture
appropriated
by
the
same
testimony
to
the
fair
bride
but
these
articles
are
supposed
to
have
been
of
earlier
fabric
than
that
of
the
scarf
probably
the
year
and
they
are
of
less
exquisite
manufacture
the
former
appearing
to
be
from
the
fine
looms
of
france
and
the
latter
wrought
in
the
less
practiced
machinery
of
our
then
ruder
northern
isle
the
cap
is
of
a
pale
red
silk
with
gold
cord
and
embroidery
down
the
seams
it
being
formed
to
fit
the
head
and
therefore
in
compartments
broad
where
they
are
inserted
into
the
rich
round
the
head
and
narrowing
to
the
top
it
looked
something
like
an
albanian
cap
the
gloves
which
are
said
to
have
been
those
of
the
chief
were
of
a
brownish
fine
leather
with
embroidered
gauntlet
tops
the
lady
are
of
a
lighter
hue
still
softer
leather
with
gay
fringe
of
silk
and
gold
and
tassels
at
the
wrists
both
these
pairs
of
gloves
were
well
shaped
and
most
neatly
sewed
on
these
relics
of
antiquity
and
of
ancestorial
memorials
devolving
on
jefferson
he
sought
for
a
place
of
deposit
for
them
suitable
to
their
dignity
their
character
and
their
times
he
had
in
his
possession
a
curious
old
table
of
the
era
of
henry
the
eighth
which
he
soon
adapted
to
the
purpose
its
large
oaken
slab
was
of
sufficient
dimensions
to
admit
of
the
royal
gift
being
spread
in
graceful
folds
over
the
dark
surface
of
the
wood
which
the
better
displayed
the
tissue
interchanging
tints
and
also
gave
room
for
the
disposal
of
the
cap
and
gloves
which
were
placed
in
a
kind
of
armorial
crest
between
its
gauntlets
at
the
head
of
the
scarf
and
at
its
foot
was
added
a
beautifully
written
inscription
in
old
emblazoned
characters
historic
of
the
interesting
relics
above
the
whole
is
secured
from
dust
or
other
injury
by
a
covering
of
extending
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
table
which
having
a
raised
carved
oak
of
about
four
inches
high
along
all
its
sides
forms
a
sort
of
castellated
sanctuary
that
completely
defends
from
accident
the
glass
and
the
treasure
beneath
it
which
is
distinctly
seen
through
the
lucid
medium
the
shape
of
the
table
is
like
that
we
call
a
but
very
long
being
five
feet
by
two
and
a
half
the
depth
of
its
frieze
altogether
is
eight
inches
for
it
extends
four
inches
below
the
parapet
above
and
this
lower
portion
is
worked
into
a
foliage
enwreathing
the
sides
the
whole
height
of
the
table
from
the
feet
of
its
pedestal
is
three
feet
two
inches
this
pedestal
or
rather
branching
stem
of
polished
oak
being
of
the
sturdy
contour
of
its
original
growth
with
its
superb
ramifications
supporting
the
precious
slab
above
shows
an
elaborate
design
in
its
carvings
far
beyond
my
power
to
describe
so
luxuriant
so
various
so
intricate
one
might
almost
suppose
that
the
matchless
tool
of
the
famous
benevanta
cellini
had
traced
its
wild
and
graceful
grotesque
the
four
claws
which
are
like
roots
from
the
stem
of
the
pedestal
partake
of
the
same
rich
arabesque
in
their
design
and
terminate
in
the
form
of
lion
paws
the
end
