preface
the
two
portuguese
chronicles
a
translation
of
which
into
english
is
now
for
the
first
time
offered
to
the
public
are
contained
in
a
folio
volume
in
the
bibliotheque
nationale
in
paris
amongst
the
manuscripts
of
which
institution
it
bears
the
designation
port
no
the
volume
in
question
consists
of
copies
of
four
original
documents
the
first
two
written
by
fernao
nuniz
and
domingo
paes
being
those
translated
below
the
last
two
at
the
end
of
the
letters
written
from
china
about
the
year
these
will
probably
be
published
in
translation
by
donald
ferguson
in
the
pages
of
the
indian
antiquary
the
first
pair
of
original
papers
was
sent
with
a
covering
letter
by
some
one
at
goa
to
some
one
in
europe
the
names
are
not
given
but
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
that
the
recipient
was
the
historian
barros
in
lisbon
both
these
papers
are
in
the
same
handwriting
which
fact
since
they
were
written
by
separate
portuguese
merchants
or
travellers
at
vijayanagar
in
different
years
one
i
believe
shortly
subsequent
to
the
latter
not
later
than
about
or
conclusively
proves
them
to
be
copies
of
the
originals
and
not
the
originals
themselves
i
have
inserted
a
facsimile
of
two
pages
of
the
text
so
that
no
doubt
may
remain
on
this
point
the
first
portion
consists
of
the
conclusion
of
the
text
of
fernao
nuniz
the
second
of
the
covering
letter
written
by
the
person
who
sent
the
originals
to
europe
the
third
of
the
beginning
of
the
text
of
domingo
paes
paes
being
the
earlier
in
date
about
i
have
given
his
account
of
personal
experiences
first
and
afterwards
the
historical
summary
composed
by
nuniz
about
the
year
or
i
have
stated
that
the
person
to
whom
the
documents
were
sent
from
goa
was
probably
the
celebrated
historian
barros
he
is
alluded
to
in
the
covering
letter
in
the
words
it
seemed
necessary
to
do
what
your
honour
desired
of
me
i
send
both
the
summaries
because
your
honour
can
gather
what
is
useful
to
you
from
both
and
at
the
end
of
the
long
note
on
togao
mamede
king
of
delhi
quoted
in
my
introduction
i
kiss
your
honour
hand
since
the
first
decada
of
barros
was
published
in
this
argument
is
not
unreasonable
while
a
comparison
between
the
accounts
given
by
nuniz
and
barros
of
the
siege
and
battle
of
raichur
sufficiently
proves
that
one
was
taken
from
the
other
but
we
have
fortunately
more
direct
evidence
for
the
discovery
of
which
we
have
to
thank
ferguson
i
have
mentioned
above
that
at
the
end
of
the
volume
are
copies
of
two
letters
concerning
china
these
were
written
subsequent
to
the
year
by
vasco
calvo
and
christovao
vieyra
ferguson
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
in
the
third
decada
liv
iv
caps
after
quoting
some
passages
almost
verbatim
from
this
chronicle
of
nuniz
regarding
vijayanagar
barros
writes
according
to
two
letters
which
our
people
had
two
or
three
years
afterwards
from
these
two
men
vasco
calvo
brother
of
diogo
calvo
and
christovao
vieyra
who
were
prisoners
in
canton
etc
he
also
mentions
these
letters
in
two
subsequent
passages
and
quotes
from
them
this
renders
it
certain
that
barros
saw
those
letters
and
since
they
are
copied
into
the
same
volume
which
contains
the
chronicles
of
nuniz
and
paes
we
may
be
sure
that
barros
had
the
whole
before
him
it
is
of
little
importance
to
settle
the
question
whether
the
chronicles
of
nuniz
and
paes
were
sent
direct
to
barros
whether
that
is
barros
himself
is
the
addressee
of
the
covering
letter
or
to
some
other
official
the
our
people
of
the
passage
from
barros
last
quoted
but
that
barros
saw
them
seems
certain
and
it
is
therefore
most
probable
that
the
paris
was
a
volume
of
copies
prepared
for
him
from
the
originals
these
documents
possess
peculiar
and
unique
value
that
of
paes
because
it
gives
us
a
vivid
and
graphic
account
of
his
personal
experiences
at
the
great
hindu
capital
at
the
period
of
its
highest
grandeur
and
magnificence
things
which
i
saw
and
came
to
know
he
tells
us
and
that
of
nuniz
because
it
contains
the
traditional
history
of
the
country
gathered
on
the
spot
and
a
narrative
of
local
and
current
events
of
the
highest
importance
known
to
him
either
because
he
himself
was
present
or
because
he
received
the
information
from
those
who
were
so
the
summaries
of
the
historians
already
alluded
to
though
founded
as
i
believe
partly
on
these
very
chronicles
have
taken
all
the
life
out
of
them
by
eliminating
the
personal
factor
the
presence
of
which
in
the
originals
gives
them
their
greatest
charm
senhor
lopes
who
has
published
these
documents
in
the
original
portuguese
in
a
recent
work
writes
in
his
introduction
nothing
that
we
know
of
in
any
language
can
compare
with
them
whether
for
their
historical
importance
or
for
the
description
given
of
the
country
and
especially
of
the
capital
its
products
customs
and
the
like
the
italian
travellers
who
visited
and
wrote
about
this
country
nicolo
di
conti
varthema
and
federici
are
much
less
minute
in
the
matter
of
the
geography
and
customs
of
the
land
and
not
one
of
them
has
left
us
a
chronicle
they
are
indeed
invaluable
and
throw
an
extraordinary
light
on
the
condition
of
vijayanagar
as
well
as
on
several
doubtful
points
of
history
thus
for
instance
we
have
in
nuniz
for
the
first
time
a
definite
account
of
the
events
that
led
to
the
fall
of
the
first
dynasty
and
the
establishment
of
the
second
by
the
usurpation
of
narasimha
previous
to
the
publication
of
these
chronicles
by
senhor
lopes
we
had
nothing
to
guide
us
in
this
matter
save
a
few
vague
and
unsatisfactory
lines
in
the
chronicle
of
the
historian
firishtah
now
all
is
made
clear
and
though
as
yet
the
truth
can
not
be
definitely
determined
at
least
we
have
an
explicit
and
exceedingly
interesting
story
paes
too
as
well
as
nuniz
conclusively
proves
to
us
that
krishna
deva
raya
was
really
the
greatest
of
all
the
kings
of
vijayanagar
and
not
the
mere
puppet
that
firishtah
appears
to
consider
him
firishtah
does
not
mention
him
by
name
for
paes
saw
him
on
several
occasions
and
speaks
of
him
in
warm
and
glowing
terms
while
nuniz
whose
narrative
was
evidently
firsthand
never
so
much
as
hints
that
his
armies
were
led
to
victory
by
any
other
general
but
the
king
himself
nuniz
also
gives
us
a
graphic
description
from
personal
knowledge
of
the
character
of
krishna
degenerate
successor
achyuta
whose
feebleness
selfishness
cowardice
and
cruelty
paved
the
way
for
the
final
destruction
of
the
great
empire
by
the
side
of
these
two
chronicles
the
writings
of
the
great
european
historians
seem
cold
and
lifeless
i
have
mentioned
the
publication
of
senhor
lopes
it
is
to
that
distinguished
arabic
scholar
that
we
owe
the
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
these
precious
documents
he
it
was
who
brought
them
to
light
in
the
first
instance
and
to
him
personally
i
owe
the
fact
of
my
being
able
to
translate
and
publish
them
his
introduction
to
the
dos
reis
de
bisnaga
is
full
of
valuable
matter
india
owes
him
a
debt
of
gratitude
for
his
services
and
for
myself
i
desire
to
record
here
my
sincere
thanks
for
the
disinterested
and
generous
help
he
has
so
constantly
accorded
to
me
during
the
last
two
years
my
thanks
are
also
due
to
donald
ferguson
for
his
careful
revision
of
the
whole
of
my
translations
i
desire
further
to
express
my
appreciation
of
a
particular
kindness
done
to
me
by
colonel
temple
and
lastly
to
acknowledge
gratefully
the
liberality
of
the
governor
of
madras
and
the
members
of
his
council
who
by
subsidising
this
work
have
rendered
its
publication
possible
i
trust
that
my
remarks
regarding
the
causes
of
the
downfall
of
portuguese
trade
in
the
sixteenth
century
will
not
be
misunderstood
it
is
not
in
any
spirit
of
criticism
or
comparison
that
i
have
written
those
passages
history
however
is
history
and
it
is
a
fact
that
while
the
main
cause
of
the
small
success
which
attended
the
efforts
of
the
portuguese
to
establish
a
great
and
lasting
commerce
with
india
was
no
doubt
the
loss
of
trade
after
the
destruction
of
vijayanagar
there
must
be
added
to
this
by
the
impartial
recorder
the
dislike
of
the
inhabitants
to
the
violence
and
despotism
of
the
viceroys
and
to
the
uncompromising
intolerance
of
the
jesuit
fathers
as
well
as
the
horror
engendered
in
their
minds
by
the
severities
of
the
terrible
inquisition
at
goa
a
word
as
to
my
spelling
of
names
i
have
adopted
a
medium
course
in
many
cases
between
the
crudities
of
former
generations
and
the
scientific
requirements
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
the
result
of
which
will
probably
be
my
condemnation
by
both
parties
but
to
the
highly
educated
i
would
point
out
that
this
work
is
intended
for
general
reading
and
that
i
have
therefore
thought
it
best
to
avoid
the
use
of
a
special
font
of
type
containing
the
proper
diacritical
points
while
to
the
rest
i
venture
to
present
the
plea
that
the
time
has
passed
when
vijayanagar
needs
to
be
spelt
beejanuggur
or
kondavidu
condbeer
thus
i
have
been
bold
enough
to
drop
the
final
and
essential
a
of
the
name
of
the
great
city
and
spell
the
word
vijayanagar
as
it
is
usually
pronounced
by
the
english
the
name
is
composed
of
two
words
vijaya
victory
and
nagara
city
all
the
a
to
be
pronounced
short
like
the
u
in
sun
or
the
a
in
organ
narasimha
ought
no
doubt
to
be
spelt
nrisimha
but
that
in
such
case
the
ri
ought
to
have
a
dot
under
the
r
as
the
syllable
is
really
a
vowel
and
i
have
preferred
the
common
spelling
of
modern
days
here
again
all
three
a
are
short
as
with
the
final
a
in
vijayanagara
so
with
the
final
u
in
such
names
as
kondavidu
it
has
been
dropped
in
order
to
avoid
an
appearance
of
pedantry
and
i
have
preferred
the
more
common
rajahmundry
to
the
more
correct
rajamahendri
trichinopoly
to
tiruchhinapalle
and
so
on
this
system
may
not
be
very
scientific
but
i
trust
it
will
prove
not
unacceptable
the
name
of
the
capital
is
spelt
in
many
different
ways
by
the
chroniclers
and
travellers
the
usual
portuguese
spelling
was
bisnaga
but
we
have
also
the
forms
bicheneger
nikitin
bidjanagar
abdur
razzak
bizenegalia

muhammad

of

his
career
and
character
in
the
year
during
the
reign
of
edward
iii
of
england
there
occurred
in
india
an
event
which
almost
instantaneously
changed
the
political
condition
of
the
entire
south
with
that
date
the
volume
of
ancient
history
in
that
tract
closes
and
the
modern
begins
it
is
the
epoch
of
transition
from
the
old
to
the
new
this
event
was
the
foundation
of
the
city
and
kingdom
of
vijayanagar
prior
to
all
southern
india
had
lain
under
the
domination
of
the
ancient
hindu
kingdoms
kingdoms
so
old
that
their
origin
has
never
been
traced
but
which
are
mentioned
in
buddhist
edicts
sixteen
centuries
earlier
the
pandiyans
at
madura
the
cholas
at
tanjore
and
others
when
vijayanagar
sprang
into
existence
the
past
was
done
with
for
ever
and
the
monarchs
of
the
new
state
became
lords
or
overlords
of
the
territories
lying
between
the
dakhan
and
ceylon
there
was
no
miracle
in
this
it
was
the
natural
result
of
the
persistent
efforts
made
by
the
muhammadans
to
conquer
all
india
when
these
dreaded
invaders
reached
the
krishna
river
the
hindus
to
their
south
stricken
with
terror
combined
and
gathered
in
haste
to
the
new
standard
which
alone
seemed
to
offer
some
hope
of
protection
the
decayed
old
states
crumbled
away
into
nothingness
and
the
fighting
kings
of
vijayanagar
became
the
saviours
of
the
south
for
two
and
a
half
centuries
and
yet
in
the
present
day
the
very
existence
of
this
kingdom
is
hardly
remembered
in
india
while
its
once
magnificent
capital
planted
on
the
extreme
northern
border
of
its
dominions
and
bearing
the
proud
title
of
the
city
of
victory
has
entirely
disappeared
save
for
a
few
scattered
ruins
of
buildings
that
were
once
temples
or
palaces
and
for
the
long
lines
of
massive
walls
that
constituted
its
defences
even
the
name
has
died
out
of
men
minds
and
memories
and
the
remains
that
mark
its
site
are
known
only
as
the
ruins
lying
near
the
little
village
of
hampe
its
rulers
however
in
their
day
swayed
the
destinies
of
an
empire
far
larger
than
austria
and
the
city
is
declared
by
a
succession
of
european
visitors
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
to
have
been
marvellous
for
size
and
prosperity
a
city
with
which
for
richness
and
magnificence
no
known
western
capital
could
compare
its
importance
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
almost
all
the
struggles
of
the
portuguese
on
the
western
coast
were
carried
on
for
the
purpose
of
securing
its
maritime
trade
and
that
when
the
empire
fell
in
the
prosperity
of
portuguese
goa
fell
with
it
never
to
rise
again
our
very
scanty
knowledge
of
the
events
that
succeeded
one
another
in
the
large
area
dominated
by
the
kings
of
vijayanagar
has
been
hitherto
derived
partly
from
the
scattered
remarks
of
european
travellers
and
the
desultory
references
in
their
writings
to
the
politics
of
the
inhabitants
of
india
partly
from
the
summaries
compiled
by
careful
mediaeval
historians
such
as
barros
couto
and
correa
who
though
to
a
certain
degree
interested
in
the
general
condition
of
the
country
yet
confined
themselves
mostly
to
recording
the
deeds
of
the
european
colonisers
for
the
enlightenment
of
their
european
readers
partly
from
the
chronicles
of
a
few
muhammadan
writers
of
the
period
who
often
wrote
in
fear
of
the
displeasure
of
their
own
lords
and
partly
from
hindu
inscriptions
recording
grants
of
lands
to
temples
and
religious
institutions
which
documents
when
viewed
as
state
papers
seldom
yield
us
more
than
a
few
names
and
dates
the
two
chronicles
however
translated
and
printed
at
the
end
of
this
volume
will
be
seen
to
throw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
condition
of
the
city
of
vijayanagar
early
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
upon
the
history
of
its
successive
dynasties
and
for
the
rest
i
have
attempted
as
an
introduction
to
these
chronicles
to
collect
all
available
materials
from
the
different
authorities
alluded
to
and
to
weld
them
into
a
consecutive
whole
so
as
to
form
a
foundation
upon
which
may
hereafter
be
constructed
a
regular
history
of
the
vijayanagar
empire
the
result
will
perhaps
seem
disjointed
crude
and
uninteresting
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
it
is
only
a
first
attempt
i
have
little
doubt
that
before
very
long
the
whole
history
of
southern
india
will
be
compiled
by
some
writer
gifted
with
the
power
of
making
the
dry
bones
live
but
meanwhile
the
bones
themselves
must
be
collected
and
pieced
together
and
my
duty
has
been
to
try
and
construct
at
least
the
main
portions
of
the
skeleton
before
proceeding
to
details
we
must
shortly
glance
at
the
political
condition
of
india
in
the
first
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
remembering
that
up
to
that
time
the
peninsula
had
been
held
by
a
number
of
distinct
hindu
kingdoms
those
of
the
pandiyans
at
madura
and
of
the
cholas
at
tanjore
being
the
most
important
the
year
saw
the
first
inroad
into
india
of
the
muhammadans
from
over
the
border
under
their

in
no

did
he
make

his

were

and
nothing
more

followed
in

and
after

of

the

from
that

northern

thus
the

opens
about
the
year
found
the
whole
of
northern

down
to
the

mountains
firmly
under
moslem
rule
while
the
followers
of
that
faith
had
overrun
the

and
were
threatening
the
south
with
the
same
fate
south
of
the
krishna
the
whole
country
was
still
under
hindu
domination
but
the
supremacy
of
the
old
dynasties
was
shaken
to
its
base
by
the
rapidly
advancing
terror
from
the
north
with
the
accession
in
of
muhammad
taghlaq
of
delhi
things
became
worse
still
marvellous
stories
of
his
extraordinary
proceedings
circulated
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
the
peninsula
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
bound
to
his
intolerance
ambition
and
ferocity
everything
therefore
seemed
to
be
leading
up
to
but
one
inevitable
end
the
ruin
and
devastation
of
the
hindu
provinces
the
annihilation
of
their
old
royal
houses
the
destruction
of
their
religion
their
temples
their
cities
all
that
the
dwellers
in
the
south
held
most
dear
seemed
tottering
to
its
fall
suddenly
about
the
year
there
was
a
check
to
this
wave
of
foreign
invasion
a
stop
a
halt
then
a
solid
wall
of
opposition
and
for
years
southern
india
was
saved
the
check
was
caused
by
a
combination
of
small
hindu
states
two
of
them
already
defeated
warangal
and
dvarasamudra
defeated
and
therefore
in
all
probability
not
the
third
the
tiny

the
solid

consisted
of
anegundi
grown
into
the
great

of

vijayanagar
to
the
kings
of
this
house
all
the
nations
of
the
south
submitted
if
a
straight
line
be
drawn
on
the
map
of
india
from
bombay
to
madras
about
across
will
be
found
the
river
tungabhadra
which
itself
a
combination
of
two
streams
running
northwards
from
maisur
flows
in
a
wide
circuit
north
and
east
to
join
the
krishna
not
far
from
kurnool
in
the
middle
of
its
course
the
tungabhadra
cuts
through
a
wild
rocky
country
lying
about
forty
miles
of
bellary
and
north
of
the
railway
line
which
runs
from
that
place
to
dharwar
at
this
point
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
there
existed
about
the
year
a
fortified
town
called
anegundi
the
nagundym
of
our
chronicles
which
was
the
residence
of
a
family
of
chiefs
owning
a
small
state
in
the
neighbourhood
they
had
in
former
years
taken
advantage
of
the
lofty
hills
of
granite
which
cover
that
tract
to
construct
a
strong
citadel
having
its
base
on
the
stream
fordable
at
no
point
within
many
miles
the
river
was
full
of
running
water
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
in
flood
times
formed
in
its
confined
bed
a
turbulent
rushing
torrent
with
dangerous
falls
in
several
places
of
the
anegundi
chiefs
we
know
little
but
they
were
probably
feudatories
of
the
hoysala
ballalas
firishtah
declares
that
they
had
existed
as
a
ruling
family
for
seven
hundred
years
prior
to
the
year
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
gives
a
definite
account
of
how
the
sovereigns
of
vijayanagar
first
began
to
acquire
the
power
which
afterwards
became
so
extensive
this
account
may
or
may
not
be
accurate
in
all
details
but
it
at
least
tallies
fairly
with
the
epigraphical
and
other
records
of
the
time
according
to
him
muhammad
taghlaq
of
delhi
having
reduced
gujarat
marched
southwards
through
the
dakhan
balaghat
or
high
lands
above
the
western
ghats
and
a
little
previous
to
the
year
seized
the
town
and
fortress
of
anegundi
its
chief
was
slain
with
all
the
members
of
his
family
after
a
futile
attempt
to
govern
this
territory
by
means
of
a
deputy
muhammad
raised
to
the
dignity
of
chief
of
the
state
its
late
minister
a
man
whom
nuniz
calls
deorao
for
deva
raya
or
harihara
deva
i
the
new
chief
founded
the
city
of
vijayanagar
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
opposite
anegundi
and
made
his
residence
there
with
the
aid
of
the
great
religious
teacher
madhava
wisely
holding
that
to
place
the
river
between
him
and
the
moslems
was
to
establish
himself
and
his
people
in
a
condition
of
greater
security
than
before
he
was
succeeded
by
one
called
bucarao
bukka
who
reigned
years
and
the
next
king
was
the
latter
son
pureoyre
deo
harihara
deva
we
know
from
other
sources
that
part
at
least
of
this
story
is
correct
harihara
and
bukka
were
the
first
two
kings
and
were
brothers
while
the
third
king
harihara
was
certainly
the
son
of
bukka
the
success
of
the
early
kings
was
phenomenal
ibn
batuta
who
was
in
india
from
to
states
that
even
in
his
day
a
muhammadan
chief
on
the
western
coast
was
subject
to
harihara
whom
he
calls
haraib
or
harib
from
hariyappa
another
form
of
the
name
while
a
hundred
years
later
abdur
razzak
envoy
from
persia
tells
us
that
the
king
of
vijayanagar
was
then
lord
of
all
southern
india
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
dakhan
to
cape
comorin
from
the
frontier
of
serendib
ceylon
to
the
extremities
of
the
country
of
kalbergah
his
troops
amount
in
number
to
eleven
lak
even
so
early
as
according
to
firishtah
the
raya
of
vijayanagar
was
in
power
wealth
and
extent
of
country
greatly
the
superior
of
the
bahmani
king
of
the
dakhan
the
old
southern
states
appear
we
have
little
history
to
guide
us
to
have
in
general
submitted
peaceably
to
the
rule
of
the
new
monarchy
they
were
perhaps
glad
to
submit
if
only
the
dreaded
foreigners
could
be
kept
out
of
the
country
and
thus
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
petty
state
grew
to
be
a
kingdom
and
the
kingdom
expanded
till
it
became
an
empire
civil
war
and
rebellion
amongst
the
muhammadans
helped
harihara
and
bukka
in
their
enterprise
sick
of
the
tyranny
and
excesses
of
muhammad
taghlaq
the
dakhan
revolted
in
and
the
independent
kingdom
of
the
bahmanis
was
for
a
time
firmly
established
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
opens
with
the
following
sentence
in
the
year
twelve
hundred
and
thirty
these
parts
of
india
were
ruled
by
a
greater
monarch
than
had
ever
reigned
this
was
the
king
of
dili
who
by
force
of
arms
and
soldiers
made
war
on
cambaya
for
many
years
taking
and
destroying
in
that
period
the
land
of
guzarate
which
belongs
to
cambaya
and
in
the
end
he
became
its
lord
after
this
the
king
of
delhi
advanced
against
vijayanagar
by
way
of
the
balaghat
this
date
is
a
century
too
early
as
already
pointed
out
the
sovereign
referred
to
is
stated
in
the
following
note
entered
by
nuniz
at
the
end
of
chapter
which
closes
the
historical
portion
of
his
narrative
to
have
been
called
togao
mamede
this
king
of
delhi
they
say
was
a
moor
who
was
called
togao
mamede
he
is
held
among
the
hindus
as
a
saint
they
relate
that
once
while
he
was
offering
prayer
to
god
there
came
to
him
four
arms
with
four
hands
and
that
every
time
he
prayed
roses
fell
to
him
from
out
of
heaven
he
was
a
great
conqueror
he
held
a
large
part
of
this
earth
under
his
dominion
he
subdued
blank
in
original
kings
and
slew
them
and
flayed
them
and
brought
their
skins
with
him
so
that
besides
his
own
name
he
received
the
nickname
which
means
of
skins
of
kings
he
was
chief
of
many
people
there
is
a
story
telling
how
he
fell
into
a
passion
on
account
of
being
given
eighteen
letters
of
the
alphabet
to
his
name
when
according
to
his
own
reckoning
he
was
entitled
to
there
are
tales
of
him
which
do
indeed
seem
most
marvellous
of
the
things
that
he
did
as
for
instance
how
he
made
ready
an
army
because
one
day
in
the
morning
while
standing
dressing
at
a
window
which
was
closed
a
ray
of
the
sun
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
cried
out
that
he
would
not
rest
until
he
had
killed
or
vanquished
whomsoever
had
dared
to
enter
his
apartments
while
he
was
dressing
all
his
nobles
could
not
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
even
though
they
told
him
it
was
the
sun
that
had
done
it
a
thing
without
which
they
could
not
live
that
it
was
a
celestial
thing
and
was
located
in
the
sky
and
that
he
could
never
do
any
harm
to
it
with
all
this
he
made
his
forces
ready
saying
that
he
must
go
in
search
of
his
enemy
and
as
he
was
going
along
with
large
forces
raised
in
the
country
through
which
he
began
his
march
so
much
dust
arose
that
it
obscured
the
sun
when
he
lost
sight
of
it
he
made
fresh
inquiries
as
to
what
the
thing
was
and
the
captains
told
him
that
there
was
now
no
reason
for
him
to
wait
and
that
he
might
return
home
since
he
had
put
to
flight
him
whom
he
had
come
to
seek
content
with
this
the
king
returned
by
the
road
that
he
had
taken
in
his
search
for
the
sun
saying
that
since
his
enemy
had
fled
he
was
satisfied
other
extravagances
are
told
of
him
which
make
him
out
a
great
lord
as
for
instance
that
being
in
the
charamaodel
country
he
was
told
that
certain
leagues
distant
in
the
sea
there
was
a
very
great
island
and
its
land
was
gold
and
the
stones
of
its
houses
and
those
which
were
produced
in
the
ground
were
rubies
and
diamonds
in
which
island
there
was
a
pagoda
whither
came
the
angels
from
heaven
to
play
music
and
dance
being
covetous
of
being
the
lord
of
this
land
he
determined
to
go
there
but
not
in
ships
because
he
had
not
enough
for
so
many
people
so
he
began
to
cart
a
great
quantity
of
stones
and
earth
and
to
throw
it
into
the
sea
in
order
to
fill
it
up
so
that
he
might
reach
the
island
and
putting
this
in
hand
with
great
labour
he
did
so
much
that
he
crossed
over
to
the
island
of
ceyllao
which
is
twelve
or
fifteen
leagues
off
this
causeway
that
he
made
was
it
is
said
in
course
of
time
eaten
away
by
the
sea
and
its
remains
now
cause
the
shoals
of
chillao
melliquiniby
his
seeing
how
much
labour
was
being
spent
in
a
thing
so
impossible
made
ready
two
ships
in
a
port
of
charamaodell
which
he
loaded
with
much
gold
and
precious
stones
and
forged
some
despatches
as
of
an
embassy
sent
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
island
in
which
he
professed
his
obedience
and
sent
presents
and
after
this
the
king
did
not
proceed
any
further
with
his
causeway
in
memory
of
this
work
he
made
a
very
large
pagoda
which
is
still
there
it
is
a
great
place
of
pilgrimage
there
are
two
thousand
of
these
and
similar
stories
with
which
i
hope
at
some
time
to
trouble
your
honour
and
with
other
better
ones
if
god
gives
me
life
i
kiss
your
honour
hand
to
conclusively
establish
the
fact
that
this
account
can
only
refer
to
muhammad
taghlaq
of
delhi
who
reigned
from
to
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
look
into
the
known
character
of
that
monarch
and
the
events
of
his
reign
nuniz
states
that
his
togao
mamede
conquered
gujarat
was
at
war
with
bengal
and
had
trouble
with
the
turkomans
on
the
borders
of
sheik
ismail
persia
to
take
these
in
reverse
order
early
in
the
reign
of
muhammad
taghlaq
vast
hordes
of
moghuls
invaded
the
panjab
and
advanced
almost
unopposed
to
delhi
where
the
king
bought
them
off
by
payment
of
immense
sums
of
money
next
as
to
bengal
prior
to
his
reign
that
province
had
been
subdued
had
given
trouble
and
had
again
been
reduced
in
his
reign
it
was
crushed
under
the
iron
hand
of
a
viceroy
from
delhi
bahadur
bura
who
before
long
attempted
to
render
himself
independent
he
styled
himself
bahadur
shah
and
issued
his
own
coinage
in
the
legends
on
his
coins
acknowledge
the
overlordship
of
delhi
but
two
years
later
they
describe
him
as
independent
king
of
bengal
in
muhammad
issued
his
own
coinage
for
bengal
and
proceeded
against
the
rebel
he
defeated
him
captured
him
flayed
him
alive
and
causing
his
skin
to
be
stuffed
with
straw
ordered
it
to
be
paraded
through
the
provinces
of
the
empire
as
a
warning
to
ambitious
governors
with
reference
to
gujarat
nuniz
has
been
led
into
a
slight
error
muhammad
taghlaq
certainly
did
go
there
but
only
in
what
he
did
do
was
to
conquer
the
dakhan
firishtah
mentions
among
his
conquests
dvarasamudra
malabar
anegundi
under
the
name
kampila
for
a
reason
that
will
presently
be
explained
warangal
c
and
these
places
were
as
effectually
incorporated
with
his
empire
as
the
villages
in
the
vicinity
of
delhi
he
also
held
gujarat
firmly
if
therefore
we
venture
to
correct
nuniz
in
this
respect
and
say
that
togao
mamede
made
war
on
the
dakhan
instead
of
on
gujarat
and
then
advanced
against
anegundi
wrongly
called
vijayanagar
which
place
was
not
as
yet
founded
we
shall
probably
be
not
far
from
the
truth
the
history
of
togao
mamede
so
far
is
the
history
of
muhammad
taghlaq
then
as
to
the
extraordinary
stories
told
of
him
true
or
not
they
apply
to
that
sovereign
muhammad
is
described
by
contemporary
writers
as
having
been
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
age
he
was
very
liberal
especially
to
those
learned
in
the
arts
he
established
hospitals
for
the
sick
and
for
widows
and
orphans
he
was
the
most
eloquent
and
accomplished
prince
of
his
time
he
was
skilled
in
many
sciences
such
as
physic
logic
astronomy
and
mathematics
he
studied
the
philosophies
and
metaphysics
of
greece
and
was
very
strict
in
religious
observances
but
continues
firishtah
from
whom
the
above
summary
is
taken
with
all
these
admirable
qualities
he
was
wholly
devoid
of
mercy
or
consideration
for
his
people
the
punishments
he
inflicted
were
not
only
rigid
and
cruel
but
frequently
unjust
so
little
did
he
hesitate
to
spill
the
blood
of
god
creatures
that
when
anything
occurred
which
excited
him
to
proceed
to
that
horrid
extremity
one
might
have
supposed
his
object
was
to
exterminate
the
human
species
altogether
no
single
week
passed
without
his
having
put
to
death
one
or
more
of
the
learned
and
holy
men
who
surrounded
him
or
some
of
the
secretaries
who
attended
him
the
slightest
opposition
to
his
will
drove
him
into
almost
insane
fury
and
in
these
fits
he
allowed
his
natural
ferocity
full
play
his
whole
life
was
spent
in
visionary
schemes
pursued
by
means
equally
irrational
he
began
by
distributing
enormous
sums
of
money
amongst
his
nobles
spending
so
it
is
said
in
one
day
as
much
as
pound
sterling
he
bought
off
the
invading
moghuls
by
immense
payments
instead
of
repelling
them
by
force
of
arms
shortly
after
this
he
raised
a
huge
army
for
the
conquest
of
persia
his
cavalry
according
to
firishtah
numbering
men
but
nothing
came
of
it
except
that
the
troops
not
receiving
their
pay
dispersed
and
pillaged
the
country
then
he
decided
to
try
and
conquer
china
and
sent
men
into
the
himalayas
where
almost
all
of
them
miserably
perished
and
when
the
survivors
returned
in
despair
the
king
put
them
all
to
death
he
tried
to
introduce
a
depreciated
currency
into
his
territories
as
a
means
to
wealth
issuing
copper
tokens
for
gold
which
resulted
in
entire
loss
of
credit
and
a
standstill
of
trade
this
failing
to
fill
the
treasury
he
next
destroyed
agriculture
by
intolerable
exactions
the
husbandmen
abandoned
their
fields
and
took
to
robbery
as
a
trade
and
whole
tracts
became
depopulated
the
survivors
living
in
the
utmost
starvation
and
misery
and
being
despoiled
of
all
that
they
possessed
muhammad
exterminated
whole
tribes
as
if
they
had
been
vermin
incensed
at
the
refusal
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
certain
harassed
tract
to
pay
the
inordinate
demands
of
his
subordinates
he
ordered
out
his
army
as
if
for
a
hunt
surrounded
an
extensive
tract
of
country
closed
the
circle
towards
the
centre
and
slaughtered
every
living
soul
found
therein
this
amusement
was
repeated
more
than
once
and
on
a
subsequent
occasion
he
ordered
a
general
massacre
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
hindu
city
of
kanauj
these
horrors
led
of
course
to
famine
and
the
miseries
of
the
hindus
exceeded
all
power
of
description
on
his
return
from
devagiri
on
one
occasion
he
caused
a
tooth
which
he
had
lost
to
be
interred
in
a
magnificent
stone
mausoleum
which
is
still
in
existence
at
bhir
but
perhaps
the
best
known
of
his
inhuman
eccentricities
was
his
treatment
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
great
city
of
delhi
muhammad
determined
to
transfer
his
capital
thence
to
devagiri
whose
name
he
changed
to
doulatabad
the
two
places
are
six
hundred
miles
apart
the
king
gave
a
general
order
to
every
inhabitant
of
delhi
to
proceed
forthwith
to
devagiri
and
prior
to
the
issue
of
this
order
he
had
the
entire
road
lined
with
trees
transplanted
for
the
purpose
the
unfortunate
people
were
compelled
to
obey
and
thousands
including
women
children
and
aged
persons
died
by
the
way
ibn
batuta
who
was
an
of
the
scenes
of
horror
to
which
this
gave
rise
has
left
us
the
following
description
the
sultan
ordered
all
the
inhabitants
to
quit
the
place
delhi
and
upon
some
delay
being
evinced
he
made
a
proclamation
stating
that
what
person
soever
being
an
inhabitant
of
that
city
should
be
found
in
any
of
its
houses
or
streets
should
receive
condign
punishment
upon
this
they
all
went
out
but
his
servants
finding
a
blind
man
in
one
of
the
houses
and
a
bedridden
one
in
the
other
the
emperor
commanded
the
bedridden
man
to
be
projected
from
a
balista
and
the
blind
one
to
be
dragged
by
his
feet
to
daulatabad
which
is
at
the
distance
of
ten
days
and
he
was
so
dragged
but
his
limbs
dropping
off
by
the
way
only
one
of
his
legs
was
brought
to
the
place
intended
and
was
then
thrown
into
it
for
the
order
had
been
that
they
should
go
to
this
place
when
i
entered
delhi
it
was
almost
a
desert
it
is
characteristic
of
muhammad
whimsical
despotism
that
shortly
afterwards
he
ordered
the
inhabitants
of
different
districts
to
go
and
repeople
delhi
which
they
attempted
to
do
but
with
little
success
batuta
relates
that
during
the
interval
of
desolation
the
king
mounted
on
the
roof
of
his
palace
and
seeing
the
city
empty
and
without
fire
or
smoke
said
now
my
heart
is
satisfied
and
my
feelings
are
appeased
ibn
batuta
was
a
member
of
this
king
court
and
had
every
opportunity
of
forming
a
just
conclusion
he
sums
up
his
qualities
thus
muhammad
more
than
all
men
loves
to
bestow
gifts
and
to
shed
blood
at
his
gate
one
sees
always
some
fakir
who
has
become
rich
or
some
living
being
who
is
put
to
death
his
traits
of
generosity
and
valour
and
his
examples
of
cruelty
and
violence
towards
criminals
have
obtained
celebrity
among
the
people
but
apart
from
this
he
is
the
most
humble
of
men
and
the
one
who
displays
the
most
equity
the
ceremonies
of
religion
are
observed
at
his
court
he
is
very
severe
in
all
that
concerns
prayer
and
the
punishment
that
follows
omission
of
it
his
dominating
quality
is
generosity
it
rarely
happened
that
the
corpse
of
some
one
who
had
been
killed
was
not
to
be
seen
at
the
gate
of
his
palace
i
have
often
seen
men
killed
and
their
bodies
left
there
one
day
i
went
to
his
palace
and
my
horse
shied
i
looked
before
me
and
i
saw
a
white
heap
on
the
ground
and
when
i
asked
what
it
was
one
of
my
companions
said
it
was
the
trunk
of
a
man
cut
into
three
pieces
every
day
hundreds
of
individuals
were
brought
chained
into
his
hall
of
audience
their
hands
tied
to
their
necks
and
their
feet
bound
together
some
were
killed
and
others
were
tortured
or
well
beaten
a
man
of
these
seemingly
opposite
qualities
charity
generosity
and
religious
fervour
linked
to
unbridled
lust
for
blood
and
an
apparently
overmastering
desire
to
take
life
possesses
a
character
so
bizarre
so
totally
opposed
to
hindu
ideals
that
he
would
almost
of
necessity
be
accounted
as
something
superhuman
monstrous
a
saint
with
the
heart
of
a
devil
or
a
fiend
with
the
soul
of
a
saint
hence
muhammad
in
the
course
of
years
gathered
round
his
memory
centuries
after
his
death
all
the
quaint
tales
and
curious
legends
which
an
oriental
imagination
could
devise
and
whenever
his
name
is
mentioned
by
the
old
chroniclers
it
is
always
with
some
extraordinary
story
attached
to
it
nuniz
therefore
though
accurate
in
the
main
was
a
century
too
early
in
his
opening
sentence
his
togao
mamede
can
be
none
other
than
muhammad
taghlaq
henceforward
this
will
be
assumed
chapter
origin
of
the
empire
muhammad
capture
of
kampli
and
anegundi
death
of
his
nephew
malik
naib
made
governor
of
anegundi
disturbances
harihara
deva
raya
raised
to
be
king
of
anegundi
madhavacharya
vidyaranya
the
city
of
vijayanagar
founded
legends
as
to
the
origin
of
the
new
kingdom
the
city
of
vijayanagar
is
as
already
stated
generally
supposed
to
have
been
founded
in
the
year
and
that
that
date
is
not
far
from
the
truth
may
be
gathered
from
two
facts
firstly
there
is
extant
an
inscription
of
the
earliest
real
king
harihara
or
hariyappa
the
haraib
of
ibn
batuta
dated
in
secondly
the
account
given
by
that
writer
of
a
raid
southwards
by
muhammad
taghlaq
tallies
at
almost
all
points
with
the
story
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
and
this
raid
took
place
in
for
if
a
comparison
is
made
between
the
narrative
of
batuta
and
the
traditional
account
given
by
nuniz
as
to
the
events
that
preceded
and
led
to
the
foundation
of
vijayanagar
little
doubt
will
remain
in
the
mind
that
both
relate
to
the
same
event
according
to
ibn
batuta
sultan
muhammad
marched
southwards
against
his
rebel
nephew
gushtasp
who
had
fled
to
the
protection
of
the
rai
of
kambila
or
kampila
as
firishtah
calls
the
place
in
his
stronghold
amongst
the
mountains
the
title
rai
unmistakably
points
to
the
kanarese
country
where
the
form
raya
is
used
for
rajah
while
in
kambila
or
kampila
we
recognise
the
old
town
of
kampli
a
fortified
place
about
eight
miles
east
of
anegundi
which
was
the
citadel
of
the
predecessors
of
the
kings
of
vijayanagar
though
not
itself
actually
amongst
the
mountains
kampli
is
backed
by
the
mass
of
rocky
hills
in
the
centre
of
which
the
great
city
was
afterwards
situated
it
is
highly
natural
to
suppose
that
the
rai
when
attacked
by
the
sultan
would
have
quitted
kampli
and
taken
refuge
in
the
fortified
heights
of
anegundi
where
he
could
defend
himself
with
far
greater
chance
of
success
than
at
the
former
place
and
this
would
account
for
the
difference
in
the
names
given
by
the
two
chroniclers
ibn
batuta
goes
on
to
say
that
the
raya
sent
his
guest
safely
away
to
a
neighbouring
chief
probably
the
hoysala
ballala
king
of
dvarasamudra
in
maisur
then
residing
at
tanur
he
caused
a
huge
fire
to
be
lit
on
which
his
wives
and
the
wives
of
his
nobles
ministers
and
principal
men
immolated
themselves
and
this
done
he
sallied
forth
with
his
followers
to
meet
the
invaders
and
was
slain
the
town
was
taken
and
eleven
sons
of
the
rai
were
made
prisoners
and
carried
to
the
sultan
who
made
them
all
mussalmans
after
the
fall
of
the
place
the
sultan
treated
the
king
sons
with
great
honour
as
much
for
their
illustrious
birth
as
for
his
admiration
of
the
conduct
of
their
father
and
batuta
adds
that
he
himself
became
intimately
acquainted
with
one
of
these
we
were
companions
and
friends
there
are
only
two
substantial
points
of
difference
between
this
story
and
the
traditional
hindu
account
given
by
nuniz
one
of
these
concerns
the
reason
for
the
sultan
attack
according
to
the
hindus
it
was
a
war
undertaken
from
pure
greed
of
conquest
according
to
muhammadan
story
it
was
a
campaign
against
a
rebel
the
second
is
that
while
the
hindus
declare
that
none
of
the
blood
royal
escaped
batuta
distinctly
mentions
the
survival
of
eleven
sons
and
proves
his
point
incontestably
but
this
does
not
vitiate
the
general
resemblance
of
the
two
accounts
while
the
synchronism
of
the
dates
renders
it
impossible
to
believe
that
they
can
refer
to
two
separate
events
we
may
suppose
that
since
the
eleven
sons
became
followers
of
islam
they
were
for
ever
blotted
out
of
account
to
the
orthodox
hindu
after
the
capture
of
the
fortress
the
sultan
according
to
ibn
batuta
pursued
southwards
and
arrived
near
the
city
of
the
prince
with
whom
he
had
taken
refuge
the
chief
abandoned
his
guest
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
tyrant
by
whom
he
was
condemned
to
a
death
of
fiendish
barbarity
the
sultan
ordered
the
prisoner
to
be
taken
to
the
women
his
relations
and
these
insulted
him
and
spat
upon
him
then
he
ordered
him
to
be
skinned
alive
and
as
his
skin
was
torn
off
his
flesh
was
cooked
with
rice
some
was
sent
to
his
children
and
his
wife
and
the
remainder
was
put
into
a
great
dish
and
given
to
the
elephants
to
eat
but
they
would
not
touch
it
the
sultan
ordered
his
skin
to
be
stuffed
with
straw
to
be
placed
along
with
the
remains
of
bahadur
bura
and
to
be
exhibited
through
the
country
to
continue
briefly
the
story
given
by
nuniz
after
the
capture
of
anegundi
in
the
sultan
left
malik
naib
whom
nuniz
calls
enybiquymelly
in
his
second
chapter
and
mileque
neby
meliquy
niby
and
melinebiquy
in
the
third
as
his
local
governor
and
retired
northwards
the
country
rose
against
the
usurpers
and
after
a
time
the
sultan
restored
the
principality
to
the
hindus
but
made
a
new
departure
by
raising
to
be
raya
the
former
chief
minister
deva
raya
called
deorao
or
dehorao
by
nuniz
he
reigned
seven
years
during
his
reign
this
chief
was
one
day
hunting
amongst
the
mountains
south
of
the
river
when
a
hare
instead
of
fleeing
from
his
dogs
flew
at
them
and
bit
them
the
king
astonished
at
this
marvel
was
returning
homewards
lost
in
meditation
when
he
met
on
the
the
sage
madhavacharya
surnamed
vidyaranya
or
forest
of
learning
for
so
we
learn
from
other
sources
to
name
the
anchorite
alluded
to
who
advised
the
chief
to
found
a
city
on
the
spot
and
so
the
king
did
and
on
that
very
day
began
work
on
his
houses
and
he
enclosed
the
city
round
about
and
that
done
he
left
nagumdym
and
soon
filled
the
new
city
with
people
and
he
gave
it
the
name
vydiajuna
for
so
the
hermit
called
himself
who
had
bidden
him
construct
it
thus
in
or
about
the
year
sprung
into
existence
the
great
city
which
afterwards
became
so
magnificent
and
of
such
fame
the
chronicle
continues
by
saying
that
the
king
constructed
in
the
city
of
vijayanagar
a
magnificent
temple
in
honour
of
the
sage
this
temple
i
take
to
be
the
great
temple
near
the
river
still
in
use
and
known
as
the
temple
of
hampi
or
hampe
having
a
small
village
clustering
about
it
on
the
rocks
above
it
close
to
a
group
of
more
modern
jain
temples
is
to
be
seen
a
small
shrine
built
entirely
roof
as
well
as
walls
of
stone
everything
about
this
little
relic
proves
it
to
be
of
greater
antiquity
than
any
other
structure
in
the
whole
circuit
of
the
hills
but
its
exact
age
is
doubtful
it
looks
like
a
building
of
the
seventh
century
rea
superintendent
of
the
madras
archaeological
survey
in
an
article
published
in
the
madras
christian
college
magazine
for
december
points
out
that
the
fact
of
mortar
having
been
used
in
its
construction
throws
a
doubt
upon
its
being
as
old
as
its
type
of
architecture
would
otherwise
make
it
appear
it
is
quite
possible
however
that
the
shrine
may
have
been
used
by
a
succession
of
recluses
the
last
of
whom
was
the
great
teacher
madhava
if
we
stand
on
that
rock
and
imagine
all
the
great
ruins
of
the
city
visible
from
thence
the
palaces
and
temples
the
statues
and
towers
and
walls
to
be
swept
out
of
existence
we
have
around
us
nothing
but
nature
in
one
of
her
wildest
moods
lofty
hills
near
and
far
formed
almost
entirely
of
huge
tumbled
boulders
of
granite
but
with
trees
and
grass
on
all
the
low
ground
it
was
a
lonely
spot
separated
by
the
river
from
the
mere
inhabited
country
on
the
farther
side
where
dwelt
the
chiefs
of
anegundi
and
was
just
such
as
would
have
been
chosen
for
their
abode
by
the
ascetics
of
former
days
who
loved
to
dwell
in
solitude
and
isolation
amid
scenes
of
grandeur
and
beauty
we
shall
however
in
all
probability
never
know
whether
this
hermit
whose
actual
existence
at
the
time
is
attested
by
every
tradition
regarding
the
origin
of
vijayanagar
was
really
the
great
madhava
or
another
less
celebrated
sage
on
whom
by
a
confusion
of
ideas
his
name
has
been
foisted
some
say
that
madhavacharya
lived
entirely
at
sringeri
there
are
a
number
of
other
traditions
relating
to
the
birth
of
the
city
and
empire
of
vijayanagar
one
has
it
that
two
brothers
named
bukka
and
harihara
who
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
warangal
at
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
that
kingdom
by
the
muhammadans
in
escaped
with
a
small
body
of
horse
to
the
hill
country
about
anegundi
being
accompanied
in
their
flight
by
the
brahman
madhava
or
madhavacharya
vidyaranya
and
by
some
means
not
stated
became
lords
of
that
tract
afterwards
founding
the
city
of
vijayanagar
another
states
that
the
two
brothers
were
officers
in
the
service
of
the
muhammadan
governor
of
warangal
subsequent
to
its
first
capture
in
they
were
despatched
against
the
hoysala
ballala
sovereign
in
the
expedition
under
the
command
of
malik
kafur
in
which
resulted
in
the
capture
of
the
hindu
capital
dvarasamudra
but
the
portion
of
the
force
to
which
the
brothers
belonged
suffered
a
defeat
and
they
fled
to
the
mountainous
tract
near
anegundi
here
they
met
the
holy
madhava
who
was
living
the
life
of
a
recluse
and
by
his
aid
they
established
the
kingdom
and
capital
city
a
variant
of
this
relates
that
the
two
brothers
for
some
reason
fled
direct
from
warangal
to
anegundi
this
account
redounds
more
to
their
honour
as
hindus
though
compelled
first
to
accept
service
under
their
conquerors
their
patriotism
triumphed
in
the
end
and
they
abandoned
the
flesh
pots
of
egypt
to
throw
in
their
luck
with
their
a
fourth
story
avers
that
the
hermit
madhava
himself
founded
the
city
after
the
discovery
of
a
hidden
treasure
ruled
over
it
himself
and
left
it
after
his
death
to
a
kuruba
family
who
established
the
first
regular
dynasty
a
fifth
mentioned
by
couto
who
fixes
the
date
as
states
that
while
madhava
was
living
his
ascetic
life
amongst
the
mountains
he
was
supported
by
meals
brought
to
him
by
a
poor
shepherd
called
bukka
and
one
day
the
brahman
said
to
him
shalt
be
king
and
emperor
of
all
industan
the
other
shepherds
learned
this
and
began
to
treat
this
shepherd
with
veneration
and
made
him
their
head
and
he
acquired
the
name
of
and
began
to
conquer
his
neighbours
who
were
five
in
number
canara
taligas
canguivarao
negapatao
and
he
of
the
badagas
and
he
at
last
became
lord
of
all
and
called
himself
boca
rao
he
was
attacked
by
the
king
of
delhi
but
the
latter
was
defeated
and
retired
whereupon
bukka
established
a
city
and
called
it
visaja
nagar
which
we
corruptly
call
bisnaga
and
we
call
all
the
kingdom
by
that
name
but
the
natives
amongst
themselves
always
call
it
the
of
canara
couto
narrative
seems
to
be
a
mixture
of
several
stories
his
wrong
date
points
to
his
having
partly
depended
upon
the
original
chronicle
of
nuniz
or
the
summary
of
it
published
by
barros
while
the
rest
of
the
tale
savours
more
of
hindu
romance
than
of
historical
accuracy
he
retains
however
the
tradition
of
an
attack
by
the
king
of
delhi
and
the
subsequent
retirement
another
authority
suggests
that
bukka
and
harihara
may
have
been
feudatories
of
the
hoysala
ballalas
nikitin
the
russian
traveller
who
was
in
india
in
seems
to
favour
the
view
that
they
belonged
to
the
old
royal
house
of
the
kadambas
of
banavasi
since
he
speaks
of
the
hindoo
sultan
kadam
who
resided
at
bichenegher
here
we
have
a
whole
bundle
of
tales
and
traditions
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
great
kingdom
and
can
take
our
choice
there
are
many
others
also
perhaps
the
most
reasonable
account
would
be
one
culled
from
the
general
drift
of
the
hindu
legends
combined
with
the
certainties
of
historical
fact
and
from
this
point
of
view
we
may
for
the
present
suppose
that
two
brothers
hindus
of
the
kuruba
caste
who
were
men
of
strong
religious
feeling
serving
in
the
treasury
of
the
king
of
warangal
fled
from
that
place
on
its
sack
and
destruction
in
and
took
service
under
the
petty
rajah
of
anegundi
both
they
and
their
chiefs
were
filled
with
horror
and
disgust
at
the
conduct
of
the
marauding
moslems
and
pledged
themselves
to
the
cause
of
their
country
and
their
religion
the
brothers
rose
to
be
minister
and
treasurer
respectively
at
anegundi
in
the
chief
gave
shelter
to
nephew
of
muhammad
of
delhi
and
was
attacked
by
the
sultan
anegundi
fell
as
narrated
by
batuta
and
the
sultan
retired
leaving
mallik
as
his
deputy
to
rule
the
state
mallik
found
the
people
too
strong
for
him
and
eventually
the
sultan
restored
the
country
to
the
hindus
raising
to
be
rajah
and
minister
respectively
the
two
brothers
who
had
formerly
been
minister
and
treasurer
these
were
harihara
i
hukka
and
bukka
i
the
first
vijayanagar
dynasty
the
following
shows
the
pedigree
of
this
dynasty
as
given
in
the
epigraphia
indica
iii
inscriptions
not
yet
satisfactorily
examined
will
probably
add
to
the
information
given

and

the
advancing
muhammadans
the
first
rulers
of
vijayanagar
however
did
not
dare
to
call
themselves
kings
nor
did
even
the
brahmans
do
so
who
composed
the
text
of
their
early
inscriptions
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
spoken
of
harihara
and
bukka
as
chiefs
the
inscription
referred
to
of
harihara
in
calls
him
hariyappa
vodeya
the
former
name
being
less
honourable
than
harihara
and
the
latter
definitely
entitling
him
to
rank
only
as
a
chieftain
moreover
the
sanskrit
title
given
him
is
mahamandalesvara
which
may
be
translated
great
lord
not
king
and
the
same
is
the
case
with
his
successor
bukka
in
two
inscriptions
one
of
which
is
dated
in
already
in
harihara
is
said
to
have
been
possessed
of
very
large
territories
and
he
was
the
acknowledged
overlord
of
villages
as
far
north
as
the
kaladgi
district
north
of
the
malprabha
a
country
that
had
been
overrun
by
muhammad
taghlaq
that
this
was
not
a
mere
empty
boast
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
fort
was
built
in
that
year
at
badami
by
permission
of
harihara
and
thus
we
see
the
first
chief
of
vijayanagar
quietly
and
perhaps
peacefully
acquiring
great
influence
and
extensive
possessions
these
so
rapidly
increased
that
bukka
successor
harihara
styles
himself
rajadhiraja
king
of
kings
or
emperor
but
to
revert
to
the
first
king
harihara
or
as
nuniz
calls
him
dehorao
for
deva
raya
he
reigned
according
to
our
chronicle
seven
years
and
did
nothing
therein
but
pacify
the
kingdom
which
he
left
in
complete
tranquillity
his
death
if
this
be
so
would
have
taken
place
about
the
year
nuniz
relates
that
he
founded
a
temple
in
honour
of
the
brahman
hermit
his
protector
this
was
the
great
temple
at
hampe
close
to
the
river
which
is
still
in
full
preservation
and
is
the
only
one
among
the
massive
shrines
erected
at
the
capital
in
which
worship
is
still
carried
on
the
others
were
remorselessly
wrecked
and
destroyed
by
the
muhammadans
in
as
already
stated
the
traveller
ibn
batuta
refers
to
this
king
under
the
name
of
haraib
or
harib
in
or
about
the
year
if
the
traditions
collated
by
nuniz
according
to
which
harihara
lived
at
peace
during
the
seven
years
of
his
reign
be
true
his
death
must
have
occurred
before
because
in
that
year
as
we
learn
from
other
sources
krishna
son
of
pratapa
rudra
of
warangal
took
refuge
at
vijayanagar
and
in
concert
with
its
king
and
with
the
surviving
ballala
princes
of
dvarasamudra
drove
back
the
muhammadans
rescued
for
a
time
part
of
the
southern
dakhan
country
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
overthrow
of
the
sovereignty
of
delhi
south
of
the
vindhyas
i
take
it
therefore
that
harihara
died
in
or
about
the
year
as
to
his
having
reigned
quietly
i
know
of
only
one
statement
to
the
contrary
an
inscription
of
samgama
ii
recording
a
grant
in
and
referred
to
below
states
that
harihara
i
defeated
the
sultan
but
perhaps
this
only
alludes
to
the
fact
that
muhammad
taghlaq
had
to
abandon
his
hold
on
the
country
the
next
king
was
harihara
brother
bukka
i
bucarao
and
according
to
nuniz
he
reigned
years
conquering
in
that
time
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
south
even
including
orissa
orya
without
laying
too
much
stress
on
conquests
by
force
of
arms
it
seems
certain
that
most
if
not
all
southern
india
submitted
to
his
rule
probably
only
too
anxious
to
secure
a
continuance
of
hindu
domination
in
preference
to
the
despotism
of
the
hated
followers
of
islam
according
to
the
chronicle
therefore
the
death
of
bukka
as
we
must
call
him
took
place
about
the
year
as
to
inscriptions
of
his
reign
hultzsch
mentions
that
they
cover
the
period
from
about
to
while
the
first
inscription
of
his
successor
harihara
is
dated
in
if
then
we
assume
that
bukka
reigned
till
we
find
the
chronicle
so
far
accurate
that
bukka
did
in
fact
reign
years
though
not
to
but
meanwhile
we
have
another
story
from
an
inscription
on
which
is
to
be
seen
preserved
in
the
collector
office
at
nellore
it
has
been
carefully
edited
by
krishna
sastri
according
to
this
it
would
appear
that
bukka
who
undoubtedly
was
a
man
of
war
usurped
the
throne
it
asserts
that
the
father
of
harihara
who
was
named
samgama
had
five
sons
the
eldest
was
harihara
himself
the
second
kampa
and
the
third
bukka
we
want
to
know
who
succeeded
harihara
there
is
extant
an
inscription
of
bukka
dated
in
and
there
is
this
nellore
inscription
dated
in
the
latter
comes
from
a
country
near
the
eastern
coast
and
it
relates
that
kampa
succeeded
harihara
and
that
samgama
son
of
kampa
succeeded
his
father
and
granted
a
village
in
the
nellore
district
to
the
brahmans
on
a
date
which
corresponds
to
may
it
implies
that
samgama
had
succeeded
his
father
kampa
exactly
a
year
previous
to
the
grant
thus
it
claims
that
kampa
was
king
from
to
we
know
nothing
more
of
this
and
there
is
only
one
other
document
at
present
known
to
exist
which
was
executed
in
the
reign
either
of
kampa
or
of
samgama
this
is
alluded
to
by
krishna
sastri
who
refers
us
to
the
colophon
of
the
madhaviya
dhatuvritti
according
to
which
its
author
sayanacharya
uterine
brother
of
the
great
madhavacharya
was
minister
to
king
samgama
son
of
kampa
the
only
possible
inference
is
that
the
succession
to
harihara
was
disputed
and
that
somehow
bukka
got
the
upper
hand
and
at
least
as
early
as
declared
himself
king
afterwards
claiming
to
have
immediately
succeeded
harihara
it
will
be
seen
farther
on
that
in
almost
every
case
the
kingdom
was
racked
with
dissension
on
the
demise
of
the
sovereign
and
that
year
after
year
the
members
of
the
reigning
family
were
subjected
to
violence
and
murder
in
order
that
one
or
other
of
them
might
establish
himself
as
head
of
the
state
on
the
assumption
therefore
that
the
reign
of
bukka
lasted
from
to
we
turn
to
firishtah
to
learn
what
were
this
relations
with
the
followers
of
islam
now
supreme
on
the
north
of
the
krishna
just
after
his
accession
as
it
would
appear
occurred
the
successful
campaign
alluded
to
above
in
which
a
combination
of
hindus
from
different
states
drove
back
the
invaders
here
is
account
of
what
took
place
he
is
speaking
of
the
year
which
lasted
from
may
to
may
and
he
says
that
krishna
naik
son
of
rudra
deva
of
warangal
went
privately
to
ballala
deva
and
urged
him
to
join
a
combination
of
hindus
with
the
view
of
driving
out
the
muhammadans
from
the
dakhan
the
ballala
prince
consented
and
krishna
naik
promised
when
the
preparations
were
complete
to
raise
all
the
hindus
of
telingana
and
place
himself
at
their
head
ballala
deva
then
built
the
city
of
vijayanagar
raised
an
army
and
the
war
began
warangal
then
in
the
hands
of
the
muhammadans
was
reduced
and
its
governor
retreated
to
daulatabad
or
devagiri
the
two
chiefs
then
induced
other
rajahs
of
the
malabar
and
kanara
countries
to
join
them
and
the
joint
forces
seized
the
whole
of
the
dakhan
and
expelled
the
muhammadans
there
so
that
within
a
few
months
muhammad
taghlak
had
no
possessions
in
that
quarter
except
daulatabad
so
far
the
muhammadan
historian
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
this
success
of
the
hindus
was
only
temporary
for
their
enemies
still
swarmed
in
the
dakhan
and
immediately
after
this
contest
the
hindus
appear
to
have
retired
south
of
the
krishna
leaving
the
distracted
country
a
prey
to
temporary
anarchy
this
however
was
of
short
duration
for
though
the
domination
of
the
sultan
of
delhi
in
that
tract
was
completely
destroyed
yet
three
years
later
viz
on
friday
the
according
to
firishtah
a
date
which
corresponds
to
friday
august
bahmani
was
crowned
sovereign
of
the
dakhan
at
kulbarga
establishing
a
new
dynasty
which
lasted
for
about
years
a
few
years
after
this
there
was
a
successful
invasion
of
the
carnatic
country
by
but
though
the
army
returned
with
some
booty
firishtah
does
not
claim
for
him
a
decisive
victory
he
does
however
claim
that
the
new
sultan
extended
his
territory
as
far
south
as
the
river
tungabhadra
the
vicinity
of
the
fortress
of
adoni
died
at
the
age
of
on
sunday
february
and
was
succeeded
by
muhammad
shah
the
raya
of
vijayanagar
had
presented
with
a
ruby
of
inestimable
price
and
this
set
in
a
bird
of
paradise
composed
of
precious
stones
the
sultan
placed
in
the
canopy
over
his
throne
but
some
say
that
this
was
done
by
muhammad
and
that
the
ruby
was
placed
above
his
umbrella
of
state
early
in
the
reign
of
muhammad
it
was
discovered
that
the
gold
and
silver
coins
of
the
bahrami
sultans
were
being
melted
down
in
large
quantities
by
the
hindus
of
vijayanagar
and
warangal
and
numbers
of
the
merchants
were
put
to
death
at
the
same
time
bukka
supported
by
his
friend
at
warangal
demanded
the
restoration
of
certain
territories
and
as
the
sultan
was
not
ready
for
war
he
during
a
year
and
a
half
kept
the
ambassadors
of
the
raies
at
his
court
and
sent
his
own
to
beejanugger
to
amuse
his
enemies
finally
he
resolved
on
war
and
made
extravagant
on
the
hindus
bukka
joined
forces
with
warangal
and
muhammad
waged
war
on
the
latter
state
plundering
the
country
up
to
the
capital
and
retiring
only
on
receipt
of
a
large
indemnity
firishtah
does
not
relate
that
any
further
campaign
was
at
that
time
initiated
and
we
are
therefore
free
to
suppose
that
the
muhammadans
were
unable
to
press
their
advantage
warangal
was
not
long
left
in
peace
and
it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
its
subsequent
history
before
returning
to
the
events
of
the
reign
of
bukka
at
vijayanagar
after
an
interval
enraged
at
an
insult
offered
or
supposed
to
have
been
offered
by
the
rajah
of
warangal
muhammad
made
a
rapid
advance
to
the
former
city
of
vellunputtun
as
it
is
spelt
by
firishtah
or
filampatan
according
to
the
author
of
the
he
seized
it
slaughtered
the
inhabitants
without
mercy
and
captured
the
unfortunate
prince
vinayaka
deva
the
sultan
commanded
a
pile
of
wood
to
be
lighted
before
the
citadel
and
putting
nagdeo
in
an
engine
catapult
had
him
shot
from
the
walls
into
the
flames
in
which
he
was
consumed
after
a
few
days
rest
the
sultan
retired
but
was
followed
and
harassed
by
large
bodies
of
hindus
and
completely
routed
only
men
returned
to
kulbarga
and
the
sultan
himself
received
a
severe
wound
in
his
arm
this
was
followed
by
a
joint
embassy
from
bukka
of
vijayanagar
and
the
prince
of
warangal
to
the
sultan
of
delhi
in
which
they
offered
to
act
in
conjunction
with
him
should
an
army
be
sent
southwards
by
that
monarch
in
order
to
regain
his
lost
power
in
the
dakhan
but
feroze
shah
being
too
much
employed
with
domestic
commotions
to
assist
them
did
not
attend
to
their
representations
thus
encouraged
muhammad
assembled
fresh
forces
and
despatched
them
in
two
divisions
against
warangal
and
golkonda
the
expedition
was
successful
and
the
rajah
submitted
the
sultan
receiving
golkonda
an
immense
treasure
and
a
magnificent
throne
as
the
price
of
peace
the
throne
was
set
with
precious
stones
of
great
value
and
being
still
further
enriched
by
subsequent
sovereigns
was
at
one
time
valued
at
four
millions
sterling
warangal
finally
fell
in
and
was
annexed
to
the
bahmani
kingdom
thus
bringing
the
muhammadans
down
to
the
river
krishna
all
along
its
length
except
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
east
coast
now
for
the
principal
events
of
bukka
reign
and
the
affairs
of
vijayanagar
the
story
deepens
in
interest
from
about
the
year
and
for
two
centuries
we
can
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
hindu
kingdom
without
much
difficulty
early
in
the
sultan
opened
his
first
regular
campaign
against
vijayanagar
originating
in
an
jest
it
ended
only
after
such
slaughter
that
firishtah
computes
the
victims
on
the
hindu
side
alone
as
numbering
no
less
than
half
a
million
the
story
is
told
us
by
an
one
mullah
daud
of
bidar
who
was
to
sultan
muhammad
one
evening
when
the
spring
of
the
garden
of
mirth
had
infused
the
cheek
of
mahummud
shaw
with
the
rosy
tinge
of
delight
a
band
of
musicians
sung
two
verses
of
ameer
khoossroo
in
praise
of
kings
festivity
and
music
the
sultan
was
delighted
beyond
measure
and
commanded
mallek
syef
ad
dien
ghoree
to
give
the
three
hundred
performers
a
draft
for
a
gratuity
on
the
treasury
of
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
the
minister
though
he
judged
the
order
the
effect
of
wine
in
compliance
with
the
humour
of
the
sultan
wrote
it
but
did
not
despatch
it
however
mahummud
shaw
penetrated
his
thoughts
the
next
day
he
inquired
if
the
draft
had
been
sent
to
the
roy
and
being
answered
not
exclaimed
you
a
word
without
meaning
could
escape
my
lips
i
did
not
give
the
order
in
intoxication
but
serious
design
mallek
syef
ad
dien
upon
this
affixed
the
royal
seal
to
the
draft
and
despatched
it
by
express
messenger
to
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
the
roy
haughty
and
proud
of
his
independence
placed
the
presenter
of
the
draft
on
an
ass
back
and
parading
him
through
all
the
quarters
of
beejanuggur
sent
him
back
with
every
mark
of
contempt
and
derision
he
also
gave
immediate
orders
for
assembling
his
troops
and
prepared
to
attack
the
dominions
of
the
house
of
bhamenee
with
this
intent
he
marched
with
thirty
thousand
horse
three
thousand
elephants
and
one
hundred
thousand
foot
to
the
vicinity
of
the
fortress
of
oodnee
from
whence
he
sent
detachments
to
destroy
and
lay
waste
the
country
of
the
faithful
the
raya
in
spite
of
the
season
being
that
of
the
rains
pressed
forward
to
mudkal
an
important
city
in
the
raichur
doab
or
the
large
triangle
of
country
lying
west
of
the
junction
of
the
krishna
and
tungabhadra
rivers
a
territory
which
was
ever
a
debatable
ground
between
the
hindus
and
mussulmans
and
the
scene
of
constant
warfare
for
the
next
years
mudkal
was
captured
and
all
the
inhabitants
men
women
and
children
put
to
the
sword
one
man
only
escaped
and
carried
the
news
to
kulbarga
mahummud
shaw
on
hearing
it
was
seized
with
a
transport
of
grief
and
rage
in
which
he
commanded
the
unfortunate
messenger
to
be
instantly
put
to
death
exclaiming
that
he
could
never
bear
in
his
presence
a
wretch
who
could
survive
the
sight
of
the
slaughter
of
so
many
brave
companions
the
same
day
on
a
day
in
in
the
month
of
which
lasted
from
january
to
february
the
sultan
marched
southwards
taking
a
solemn
oath
that
till
he
should
have
put
to
death
one
hundred
thousand
infidels
as
an
expiation
for
the
massacre
of
the
faithful
he
would
never
sheathe
the
sword
of
holy
war
nor
refrain
from
slaughter
when
he
reached
the
banks
of
the
kistna
he
swore
by
the
power
who
had
created
and
exalted
him
to
dominion
that
eating
or
sleep
should
be
unlawful
for
him
till
he
had
crossed
that
river
in
face
of
the
enemy
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
routed
their
army
and
gladdened
the
souls
of
the
martyrs
of
mudkul
with
the
blood
of
their
murderers
he
then
appointed
his
son
mujahid
shaw
to
succeed
him
and
mallek
syef
ad
dien
regent
of
his
kingdom
he
resigned
all
his
elephants
except
twenty
to
the
prince
gave
him
his
advice
and
sent
him
back
to
kulbarga
he
then
crossed
the
river
with
nine
thousand
chosen
horse
without
delay
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
notwithstanding
his
vast
army
was
so
alarmed
that
he
sent
off
all
his
treasure
valuable
baggage
and
elephants
towards
his
capital
intending
to
engage
the
next
morning
or
retreat
as
he
should
find
it
adviseable
the
night
being
stormy
and
heavy
rain
falling
the
elephants
and
other
beasts
of
burden
stuck
frequently
in
the
mud
and
were
not
able
to
advance
above
four
miles
from
the
camp
mahummud
shaw
heard
of
the
enemy
movement
during
the
night
and
immediately
marched
towards
them
leaving
his
encampment
standing
towards
the
dawn
he
arrived
at
the
roy
camp
and
the
alarm
being
given
so
great
was
the
confusion
that
the
infidels
fled
with
the
utmost
precipitation
towards
the
fortress
of
oodnee
leaving
everything
behind
them
mahummud
shaw
entered
the
camp
of
their
market
and
baggage
putting
all
to
death
without
any
distinction
and
it
is
said
that
the
slaughter
amounted
to
seventy
thousand
men
women
and
children
muhammad
passed
the
hot
weather
and
the
season
of
the
early
rains
that
year
near
mudkal
and
after
being
reinforced
marched
against
adoni
in
the
plains
of
which
on
the
banks
of
the
tummedra
tungabhadra
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
had
taken
up
his
station
in
his
own
territories
having
given
the
command
of
oodnee
to
his
sister
son
here
he
had
collected
a
great
army
and
brought
elephants
and
all
the
splendid
insignia
of
empire
from
beejanuggur
the
sultan
had
with
him
a
train
of
artillery
and
in
a
short
time
crossed
the
tungabhadra
and
entered
the
domains
of
beejanuggur
which
were
now
for
the
first
time
invaded
by
a
muhammadan
sovereign
in
person
this
remark
of
firishtah
is
historically
correct
for
the
delhi
sultan
attack
on
anegundi
took
place
on
the
north
bank
of
that
river
before
continuing
the
story
i
must
note
that
firishtah
calls
the
king
of
vijayanagar
kishen
roy
otherwise
krishna
raya
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
real
name
was
bukka
the
historian
collected
his
information
more
than
two
hundred
years
after
these
events
and
often
misnamed
the
hindu
kings
of
whom
he
writes
muhammad
then
crossed
the
tungabhadra
and
only
about
miles
intervened
between
him
and
the
great
fortress
of
adoni
which
is
situated
on
a
precipitous
range
of
hills
about
that
distance
from
the
river
the
tungabhadra
at
this
portion
of
its
course
may
be
considered
as
forming
the
arc
west
to
north
of
a
quarter
circle
having
adoni
for
its
centre
the
radius
roughly
measuring
about
miles
the
river
is
fordable
at
most
seasons
of
the
year
lying
as
it
does
in
a
shallow
rocky
bed
with
low
banks
it
is
difficult
to
locate
with
any
certainty
the
scenes
of
this
campaign
but
i
gather
generally
that
finding
the
muhammadans
aiming
at
the
reduction
of
adoni
bukka
marched
out
with
a
very
large
force
to
intercept
this
move
and
placed
himself
on
the
south
bank
of
the
tungabhadra
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
threatened
fortress
the
sultan
crossed
somewhere
near
the
present
town
of
siruguppa
and
the
great
battle
that
ensued
took
place
in
the
open
perhaps
near
kavutal
kowtall
on
the
ordnance
map
here
is
firishtah
account
roy
kishen
roy
bukka
on
receiving
the
intelligence
that
muhammad
had
crossed
called
together
all
the
first
nobles
of
his
court
and
consulted
on
the
best
mode
of
opposing
the
mussulmauns
it
was
agreed
that
hoje
mul
a
maternal
relation
to
the
roy
and
commander
of
his
armies
should
have
the
conduct
of
the
war
hoje
mul
vain
to
excess
on
receiving
his
command
asked
the
roy
if
he
should
bring
the
prince
of
the
mussulmauns
alive
a
prisoner
into
his
presence
or
present
him
only
his
head
upon
a
spear
kishen
roy
replied
that
a
living
enemy
in
any
situation
was
not
agreeable
therefore
he
had
better
put
him
to
death
as
soon
as
he
should
take
him
hoje
mul
having
received
his
dismission
marched
to
oppose
mahummud
shaw
with
forty
thousand
horse
and
five
hundred
thousand
foot
he
commanded
the
bramins
to
deliver
every
day
to
the
troops
discourses
on
the
meritoriousness
of
slaughtering
the
mahummedans
in
order
to
excite
zeal
for
expelling
them
he
ordered
them
to
describe
the
butchery
of
cows
the
insults
to
sacred
images
and
destroying
of
temples
practised
by
the
true
believers
mahummud
shaw
when
the
enemy
arrived
within
fifteen
coss
of
his
camp

from

in
the
afternoon
like
the
waves
of

they
continued
in
warm
conflict
with
each
other
and
great
numbers
were
slain
on
both
sides

and
eeseh
khan
who
commanded
the
right
and
left

of

drank
the
sherbet
of
martyrdom
and
their
troops
broke
which
misfortune
had
nearly
given
a
blow
to
the
army
of
islaam
at
this
instant
mahummud
shaw
appeared
with
three
thousand
fresh
horse
this
restored
the
spirits
of

as
also
of
the
disordered

rallied

advancing
with

not
wanting
in
execution

disordering
the

he
asked
leave
to
charge
and
complete
the
rout
khan
mahummud
upon
this
detached
a
number
of
the
nobility
to
support
him
and
permitted
him
to
advance
which
he
did
with
such
rapidity
that
the
infidels
had
not
time
to
use
fireworks
cannon
but
cane
to
short
weapons
such
as
swords
and
daggers
at
this
time
an
elephant
named
sheer
shikar
belonging
to
khan
mahummud
refused
the
guidance
of
his
driver
and
rushed
into
the
center
of
the
enemy
line
where
he
was
stopped
by
the
elephants
of
hoje
mul
roy
and
his
driver
was
killed
khan

with
five
hundred
horse
followed
and
the

becoming

turned
upon
the

throwing
their
ranks
into
confusion
hoje

after
receiving
a
mortal
wound
fled
and
his
followers
no
longer
made
resistance
the
infidels
seeing
their
center
broke
fled
on
all
sides
the
scymetars
of
the
faithful
were
not
yet
sheathed
from
slaughter
when
the
royal
umbrella
appeared
the
sultan
gave
orders
to
renew
the
massacre
of
the
unbelievers
they
were
executed
with
such
strictness
that
pregnant
women
and
even
children
at
the
breast
did
not
escape
the
sword
mahummud
shaw
halted
a
week
on
the
field
and
dispatched
accounts
of
his
victory
to
his
own
dominions
in
performance
of
his
vow
of
massacre
he
next
marched
towards
the
camp
of
kishen
roy
who
thinking
himself
unable
to
oppose
notwithstanding
his
numerous
force
fled
to
the
woods
and
mountains
for
shelter
the
sultan
followed
him
from
place
to
place
for
three
months
putting
to
death
all
who
came
in
his
way
without
distinction
at
length
kishen
roy
took
the
road
of
beejanuggur
his
capital
the
sultan
pursuing
soon
arrived
with
his
army
near
the
city
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
sultan
besieged
vijayanagar
in
vain
for
a
month
and
then
retreated
across
the
tungabhadra
harassed
at
every
step
by
masses
of
the
hindus
from
the
city
he
halted
at
last
in
an
open
plain
and
the
king
also
pitched
his
camp
at
no
great
distance
muhammad
retreat
had
been
deliberately
carried
out
in
order
to
draw
on
his
enemy
and
cause
him
by
to
neglect
proper
precautions
the
ruse
was
successful
the
muhammadans
made
a
sudden
and
unexpected
bukka
called
as
before
kishen
was
off
his
guard
having
indulged
in
wine
and
the
amusements
provided
by
a
band
of
the
slaughter
was
terrible
and
the
raya
fled
to
vijayanagar
ten
thousand
of
his
troops
being
slain
but
this
did
not
satisfy
the
rage
of
the
sultan
who
commanded
the
inhabitants
of
every
place
round
beejanuggur
to
be
massacred
without
mercy
then
bukka
tried
to
make
peace
but
the
sultan
refused
at
this
time
a
favourite
remarked
to
the
sultan
that
he
had
only
sworn
to
slaughter
one
hundred
thousand
hindoos
and
not
totally
to
destroy
their
race
the
sultan
replied
that
though
twice
the
number
of
his
vow
might
have
been
slain
yet
till
the
roy
should
submit
and
satisfy
the
musicians
he
would
not
pardon
him
or
spare
the
lives
of
his
subjects
to
this
the
ambassadors
who
had
full
powers
agreed
and
the
money
was
paid
at
the
instant
mahummud
shaw
then
said
be
to
god
that
what
i
ordered
has
been
performed
i
would
not
let
a
light
word
be
recorded
of
me
in
the
pages
of
time
the
ambassadors
then
pleaded
that
no
religion
ordained
that
the
innocent
and
particularly
helpless
women
and
children
should
suffer
for
the
guilty
if
kishen
roy
had
been
faulty
the
poor
and
wretched
had
not
been
partakers
in
his
crimes
mahummud
shaw
replied
that
the
decrees
of
providence
had
so
ordered
and
that
he
had
no
power
to
alter
them
the
ambassadors
finally
urged
that
as
the
two
nations
were
neighbours
it
were
surely
best
to
avoid
unnecessary
cruelty
which
would
only
embitter
their
relations
with
one
another
and
this
argument
had
effect
mahummud
shaw
was
struck
by
their
remarks
and
took
an
oath
that
he
would
not
in
future
put
to
death
a
single
enemy
after
victory
and
would
bind
his
successors
to
observe
the
same
lenity
for
some
years
no
doubt
the
promise
was
fulfilled
but
we
read
of
wholesale
massacres
perpetrated
by
sovereigns
of
later
date
as
to
muhammad
firishtah
glories
in
the
statement
that
he
had
slaughtered
hindus
and
so
wasted
the
districts
of
the
carnatic
that
for
several
decades
they
did
not
recover
their
natural
population
thus
ended
the
war
and
for
some
years
there
was
peace
between
vijayanagar
and
kulbarga
muhammad
shah
died
on
april
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
mujahid
then
nineteen
years
old
shortly
after
his
accession
mujahid
wrote
to
bukka
raya
still
called
kishen
roy
by
firishtah
that
as
some
forts
and
districts
between
the
kistnah
and
tummedra
tungabhadra
rivers
were
held
by
them
in
participation
which
occasioned
constant
disagreements
he
must
for
the
future
limit
his
confines
to
the
tummedra
and
give
up
all
on
the
eastern
side
to
him
with
the
fort
of
beekapore
and
some
other
places
this
beekapore
is
the
important
fortress
of
bankapur
south
of
dharwar
the
dakhani
sovereigns
always
looked
on
it
with
covetous
eyes
as
it
lay
on
the
direct
route
from
vijayanagar
to
the
sea
and
its
possession
would
paralyse
hindu
trade
the
raya
replied
by
a
that
the
sultan
should
evacuate
the
whole
of
the
doab
since
raichur
and
mudkal
had
always
belonged
to
the
anegundi
family
bukka
declared
the
krishna
river
to
be
the
true
boundary
and
asked
that
the
elephants
taken
by
sultan
muhammad
should
be
restored
the
sultan
answer
was
a
declaration
of
war
he
advanced
in
person
crossed
both
the
rivers
and
arrived
before
adoni
on
hearing
that
the
raya
was
encamped
on
the
bank
of
the
tungabhadra
he
left
one
force
to
besiege
the
fortress
sent
another
to
advance
towards
vijayanagar
and
himself
marched
probably
in
a
direction
towards
the
river
by
slow
marches
and
with
great
caution
the
hindu
prince
at
first
prepared
to
receive
his
attack
but
for
some
reason
lost
heart
and
retired
to
the
forests
on
the
hills
of
sandur
south
of
his
capital
firishtah
here
pays
a
tribute
to
the
interest
felt
by
the
inhabitants
of
this
part
of
india
in
the
new
city
then
only
forty
years
old
but
evidently
growing
in
grandeur
year
by
year
mujahid
shaw
having
heard
great
praises
of
the
beauty
of
the
city
advanced
to
beejanuggur
but
thinking
it
too
strong
to
besiege
at
present
he
moved
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
in
the
field
now
follows
a
passage
on
which
it
is
difficult
to
place
full
reliance
but
which
only
echoes
common
tradition
it
runs
to
the
effect
that
on
the
advance
of
the
sultan
the
raya
fled
through
the
woods
and
hills
towards
seet
bunder
ramessar
followed
by
the
sultan
who
cut
passages
for
his
cavalry
through
forests
before
inaccessible
in
this
manner
the
roy
fled
from
place
to
place
for
six
months
but
never
dared
to
appear
without
the
woods
it
was
in
vain
that
the
favourites
of
the
sultan
represented
the
pursuit
as
fruitless
and
destructive
to
the
troops
he
would
not
desist
at
last
his
good
fortune
prevailed
the
health
of
kishen
roy
and
his
family
became
affected
by
the
noxious
air
of
the
woods
and
they
were
warned
to
quit
them
by
the
physicians
driven
by
necessity
he
retired
by
secret
paths
to
his
capital
of
beejanuggur
the
sultan
despatched
an
army
after
him
while
he
himself
with
the
ameer
al
amra
bahadur
khan
and
five
thousand
men
went
to
amuse
himself
with
the
sight
of
seet
bunda
ramessar
the
sultan
at
this
place
repaired
a
mosque
which
had
been
built
by
the
officers
of
sultan
alla
ad
dien
khiljee
he
broke
down
many
temples
of
the
idolaters
and
laid
waste
their
country
after
which
he
hastened
with
all
expedition
to
beejanuggur
it
is
a
fact
that
a
mosque
is
declared
to
have
been
erected
by
malik
kafur
on
the
in
but
apparently
not
at
ramesvaram
which
lies
in
the
extreme
south
of
india
on
the
eastern
coast
opposite
the
island
of
ceylon
moreover
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
a
muhammadan
sovereign
could
in
the
fourteenth
century
have
penetrated
so
far
south
with
such
a
handful
of
men
they
would
have
been
harassed
at
every
step
by
myriads
of
hindus
who
though
doubtless
trembling
at
the
sight
of
a
muhammadan
would
we
may
be
sure
never
have
permitted
men
to
traverse
in
peace
miles
of
forest
and
mountain
for
ramesvaram
is
fully
miles
from
vijayanagar
malik
kafur
expedition
is
said
to
have
taken
place
after
the
conquest
by
him
of
the
ballala
rajah
of
dvarasamudra
in
maisur
when
he
erected
a
mosque
on
the
of
malabar
and
therefore
nowhere
near
ramesvaram
colonel
briggs
has
observed
this
difficulty
and
thinks
that
the
place
alluded
to
must
be
sadasivaghur
on
the
western
coast
south
of
goa
adding
the
spot
is
called
cape
ramas
on
our
maps
he
believes
however
that
the
remains
of
an
old
mosque
do
exist
at
ramesvaram
and
its
date
should
be
settled
leaving
it
to
others
better
informed
to
throw
light
on
this
point
i
return
to
bukka
raya
and
his
doings
firishtah
says
that
there
were
two
roads
to
vijayanagar
one
fit
for
the
passage
of
armies
the
other
narrow
and
difficult
as
the
former
was
lined
with
ambushes
he
chose
the
latter
through
which
he
marched
with
a
of
troops
and
appeared
suddenly
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
if
mujahid
came
up
from
the
malabar
coast
the
former
of
these
two
roads
would
perhaps
be
the
usual
route
adopted
by
travellers
which
leads
through
open
undulating
plains
avoiding
this
route
the
sultan
may
have
turned
the
sandur
hills
by
a
flank
movement
to
his
right
and
approached
either
along
the
valley
of
sandur
or
along
the
valley
which
now
carries
the
main
road
from
bellary
to
vijayanagar
between
the
sandur
hills
and
the
hills
that
surround
the
latter
city
kishen
roy
was
astonished
at
his
boldness
and
sent
myriads
of
his
people
to
defend
the
streets
the
sultan
drove
them
before
him
and
gained
the
bank
of
a
piece
of
water
which
alone
now
divided
him
from
the
citadel
in
which
kishen
roy
resided
near
this
was
an
eminence
upon
which
stood
a
temple
covered
with
plates
of
gold
and
silver
set
with
jewels
much
venerated
by
the
hindoos
and
called
in
the
language
of
the
country
puttuk
the
sultan
esteeming
the
destruction
of
it
as
a
religious
obligation
ascended
the
hill
and
having
razed
the
temple
possessed
himself
of
the
precious
metals
and
jewels
the
piece
of
water
alluded
to
may
have
been
the
picturesque
lake
at
kamalapuram
but
which
was
the
temple
that
mujahid
destroyed
it
seems
useless
to
speculate
considering
that
the
historian
only
wrote
from
tradition
after
a
lapse
of
two
centuries
there
are
many
temples
on
hills
to
choose
from
and
several
pieces
of
water
but
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
is
that
we
are
not
told
how
the
sultan
succeeded
in
penetrating
the
outer
lines
of
works
and
in
reaching
a
spot
which
divided
him
only
from
the
inner
citadel
or
palace
enclosure
it
must
however
be
remembered
that
though
in
abdur
razzak
saw
seven
lines
of
walls
we
are
not
certain
how
many
there
were
in
the
days
of
bukka
raya
at
this
point
mujahid
was
attacked
and
nearly
lost
his
life
the
idolaters
upon
seeing
their
object
of
veneration
destroyed
raised
their
shrieks
and
lamentations
to
the
sky
they
obliged
kishen
roy
to
head
them
and
advanced
resolutely
in
astonishing
numbers
upon
which
the
sultan
formed
his
disposition
he
laid
aside
his
umbrella
and
with
one
of
his
an
afghaun
named
mhamood
crossed
a
small
rivulet
to
observe
the
numbers
and
motions
of
the
infidels
a
hindoo
who
knew
the
sultan
from
the
horse
he
rode
resolved
by
revenging
the
destruction
of
his
gods
and
country
to
gain
immortal
reputation
for
himself
he
moved
unperceived
through
the
hollows
and
broken
ground
along
the
bank
of
the
rivulet
had
gained
the
plain
and
was
charging
towards
the
sultan
at
full
speed
when
mujahid
shaw
at
a
lucky
instant
perceiving
him
made
a
sign
to
mhamood
afghaun
who
without
delay
charged
the
hindoo
mhamood
horse
rearing
he
fell
to
the
ground
his
antagonist
having
every
advantage
was
on
the
point
of
putting
him
to
death
when
sultan
mujahid
shaw
advanced
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
the
hindoo
changing
his
object
aimed
a
heavy
stroke
at
the
sultan
giving
at
the
same
instant
a
shout
of
triumph
which
made
the
spectators
believe
his
blow
was
effectual
luckily
a
helmet
of
iron
saved
the
head
of
the
sultan
who
now
inflicted
such
a
wound
on
his
enemy
that
he
was
divided
from
the
shoulder
to
the
navel
and
fell
dead
from
his
horse
upon
which
the
sultan
remounted
mhamood
and
joined
his
army
on
the
other
side
of
the
rivulet
a
battle
ensued
in
which
the
hindus
were
defeated
but
while
the
invading
force
had
hardly
recovered
from
their
fatigue
the
raya
brother
arrived
at
the
city
from
his
government
with
a
reinforcement
of
twenty
thousand
horse
and
a
vast
army
of
foot
the
fighting
then
became
furious
in
the
middle
of
the
battle
the
sultan
uncle
daud
khan
fearful
for
the
safety
of
his
sovereign
quitted
his
post
at
dhunna
sodra
and
joined
in
the
engagement
with
distinguished
gallantry
the
muhammadans
were
again
victorious
but
the
enemy
having
taken
advantage
of
daud
khan
movement
had
captured
the
abandoned
position
and
thus
seriously
threatened
the
sultan
retreat
he
therefore
left
the
field
and
by
skilful
manoeuvring
enabled
the
whole
of
his
force
to
extricate
themselves
in
safety
from
the
hills
with
between
sixty
and
seventy
thousand
prisoners
mostly
women
he
retreated
from
vijayanagar
and
sat
down
before
adoni
but
after
a
siege
lasting
nine
months
the
attempt
was
abandoned
and
the
sultan
retired
to
his
own
territories
thus
ended
the
campaign
firishtah
gives
a
short
account
of
the
kingdom
of
vijayanagar
at
this
period
about
from
which
the
following
extracts
are
taken
the
princes
of
the
house
of
bahmanee
maintained
themselves
by
superior
valour
only
for
in
power
wealth
and
extent
of
country
the
roles
of
beejanuggur
were
greatly
their
superiors
and
he
implies
that
at
this
time
as
certainly
in
after
years
all
southern
india
had
submitted
to
the
sway
of
the
raya
the
seaport
of
goa
the
fortress
of
malgaon
belonged
to
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
and
many
districts
of
tulghaut
were
in
his
possession
his
country
was
well
peopled
and
his
subjects
submissive
to
his
authority
the
roles
of
malabar
ceylon
and
other
islands
and
other
countries
kept
ambassadors
at
his
court
and
sent
annually
rich
presents
we
must
revert
for
a
moment
to
the
sultan
uncle
and
his
behaviour
before
vijayanagar
it
will
be
remembered
that
filled
with
the
best
intentions
he
had
quitted
his
post
to
defend
his
king
the
sultan
on
seeing
the
standard
of
daood
khan
was
enraged
but
stifled
his
displeasure
till
the
gale
of
victory
had
waved
over
the
standards
of
the
faithful
he
then
called
daood
khan
before
him
and
gave
him
a
harsh
reprimand
for
quitting
a
station
so
important
that
should
the
enemy
gain
possession
not
a
mussulmaun
could
make
his
escape
from
the
city
daud
treasured
up
his
resentment
at
this
treatment
and
being
joined
by
other
disaffected
nobles
secretly
plotted
the
assassination
of
the
sultan
the
conspirators
waited
till
mujahid
was
on
his
way
from
adoni
towards
kulbarga
and
then
one
night
that
of
friday
april
while
the
sultan
was
asleep
in
his
tent
daud
accompanied
by
three
other
men
rushed
in
and
stabbed
him
there
was
a
struggle
and
the
unfortunate
monarch
was
despatched
by
the
blow
of
a
sabre
daud
at
once
proclaimed
himself
sultan
as
nearest
of
kin
mujahid
having
no
children
and
being
acknowledged
proceeded
to
kulbarga
where
he
was
proclaimed
the
assassination
of
his
nephew
availed
daud
but
little
as
the
country
was
at
once
divided
into
two
opposing
factions
and
on
may
after
a
reign
of
only
one
month
the
murderer
was
himself
assassinated
while
at
prayer
in
the
great
mosque
of
the
capital
meanwhile
bukka
raya
overrun
the
doab
advanced
as
far
as
the
river

and
invested
the
fortress
of
raichur
daud
was
succeeded
by
youngest
son
mahmud
i
sister
ruh
parvar
agah
having
blinded
daud
son
then
a
boy
of
eight
years
in
order
to
prevent
dissension
mahmud
was
apparently
welcome
to
all
parties
for
even
the
raya
raised
the
siege
of
raichur
and
agreed
to
pay
him
the
tribute
exacted
by
muhammad
shah
so
at
least
says
firishtah
and
during
the
whole
of
his
reign
of
nearly
twenty
years
there
was
peace
and
tranquillity
at
home
and
abroad
he
died
on
the
april
the
decease
of
bukka
of
vijayanagar
must
apparently
for
reasons
shown
be
placed
at
about
chapter
growth
of
the

nuniz
calls
the

pureoyre
deorao
and
pureoyre
seems
to
be
a
rough
portuguese
version
of
the
name
harihara
h
and
p
representing
the
same
sound
in
the
kanarese
and
telugu
languages
according
to
the
inscriptions
harihara
ii
reigned
at
least
twenty
years
and
he
was
the
first
king
who
gave
himself
imperial
titles
under
the
style
of
maharajadhiraja
he
gave
many
grants
to
the
temples
and
consolidated
the
supremacy
of
his
dynasty
over
all
southern
india
sayana
brother
of
madhavacharya
appears
to
have
been
his
chief
minister
as
he
was
to
king
samgama
ii
mudda
is
mentioned
in
two
inscriptions
of
and
as
the
king
general
another
of
his
generals
was
called
iruga
he
was
son
of
chaicha
minister
of
bukka
ii
his
name
appears
on
a
pillar
in
a
jain
temple
near
kamalapura
at
vijayanagar
in
an
inscription
bearing
date
which
proves
that
the
king
was
tolerant
in
religious
matters
there
seems
also
to
have
been
a
general
named
gunda
living
in
his
reign
but
his
date
is
uncertain
according
to
another
inscription
king
harihara
early
in
his
reign
expelled
the
muhammadans
from
goa
and
the
last
inscription
of
his
reign
at
present
discovered
mentions
that
one
bachanna
udaiyar
was
then
governor
of
that
place
the
king
wife
or
one
of
his
principal
wives
was
malladevi
or
mallambika
the
extent
of
his
domination
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
inscriptions
of
his
reign
are
found
in
mysore
dharwar
conjeeveram
chingleput
and
trichinopoly
he
was
a
worshipper
of
siva
under
the
form
virupaksha
but
appears
to
have
been
singularly
tolerant
of
other
religions
the
latest
actual
date
of
the
reign
afforded
by
inscriptions
is
october
a
boy
of
seventeen
eldest
son
of
the
late
sultan
mahmud
had
succeeded
his
father
on
the
throne
of
kulbarga
but
on
june
he
was
treacherously
blinded
during
an
entertainment
by
an
ambitious
slave
after
a
reign
of
only
one
month
and
twenty
days
his
younger
brother
was
then
placed
on
the
throne
but
after
a
reign
of
five
months
was
blinded
and
deposed
by
his
cousin
firuz
second
son
of
the
late
sultan
daud
firuz
was
by
birth
undoubtedly
of
the
elder
branch
and
he
became
one
of
the
most
celebrated
monarchs
of
his
line
ascending
the
throne
on
november
he
must
have
then
been
well
advanced
in
years
as
firishtah
says
he
was
old
in
the
date
of
the
last
inscription
of
harihara
ii
as
yet
brought
to
light
is
as
before
stated
october
there
are
two
inscriptions
extant
of
bukka
his
eldest
son
both
dated
in
and
several
of
the
latter
successor
the
younger
brother
of
bukka
whose
name
was
devaraya
and
whose
reign
lasted
till
at
least
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
first
king
of
vijayanagar
harihara
was
an
old
man
nuniz
says
very
old
and
reigned
seven
years
his
successor
bukka
his
brother
reigned
years
according
to
nuniz
and
perhaps
therefore
it
would
be
best
not
to
assume
too
great
an
age
for
harihara
i
however
this
may
be
it
would
appear
that
when
the
peaceful
monarch
harihara
son
of
bukka
came
to
the
throne
his
father
must
have
died
at
a
very
advanced
age
and
he
himself
must
have
been
by
no
means
young
he
reigned
at
least
twenty
years
as
before
stated
and
we
are
therefore
justified
in
assuming
that
at
the
close
of
his
reign
in
he
was
quite
an
old
man
with
this
in
our
minds
let
us
turn
to
firishtah
narrative
of
the
reign
of
firuz
shah
bahmani
beginning
with
his
accession
in
november
he
tells
us
that
in
the
hijra
year
september
to
september
month
not
given
dewal
roy
of
beejanuggur
with
thirty
thousand
horse
and
a
vast
army
of
foot
invaded
the
royal
territories
between
the
rivers
with
a
design
to
reduce
the
forts
of
mudkul
and
roijore
raichur
and
in
a
later
passage
we
are
told
that
the
campaign
was
at
an
end
a
few
months
before
the
end
of
hijra
a
few
months
before
the
end
of
august
the
first
movement
of
the
hindu
army
must
therefore
have
taken
place
at
the
beginning
of
the
cold
season
of
probably
not
earlier
than
december
in
that
year
when
the
great
cotton
plains
across
which
the
troops
had
to
march
were
passable
it
can
hardly
be
supposed
that
king
harihara
then
quite
old
and
always
a
lover
of
peace
would
without
motive
have
waged
this
sudden
war
and
himself
led
his
armies
into
the
field
and
it
seems
more
likely
that
the
invasion
was
a
bold
dash
made
by
his
son
with
the
king
permission
the
muhammadan
historians
admit
an
unbroken
peace
of
twenty
years
previous
to
this
date
it
seems
therefore
that
the
chronicles
of
nuniz
the
writings
of
firishtah
and
the
extant
inscriptions
all
agree
together
and
that
we
must
place
the
death
of
harihara
ii
at
the
close
of
the
year
little
more
can
be
said
about
the
events
of
his
reign
the
new
king
his
eldest
son
bukka
must
have
been
a
man
of
middle
age
as
he
had
a
son
old
enough
to
take
the
field
with
him
before
he
himself
came
to
the
throne
this
king
says
nuniz
had
a
son
who
by
his
death
inherited
the
kingdom
who
was
called
ajarao
and
he
reigned
years
in
which
time
he
was
always
at
war
with
the
moors
i
can
give
no
explanation
as
to
why
nuniz
calls
the
successor
of
harihara
ii
ajarao
nor
as
to
his
estimate
of
years
for
his
reign
the
names
and
lengths
of
reigns
given
to
ajarao
successors
by
our
chronicler
prove
that
by
ajarao
he
means
two
kings
bukka
ii
and
his
successor
deva
raya
and
the
period
covered
by
their
combined
reigns
was
only
fourteen
years
not
nuniz
states
that
the
successor
of
harihara
ii
greatly
improved
the
city
of
vijayanagar
raising
fresh
walls
and
towers
increasing
its
extent
and
building
further
lines
of
fortification
but
his
great
work
was
the
construction
of
a
huge
dam
in
the
tungabhadra
river
and
the
formation
of
an
aqueduct
fifteen
miles
long
from
the
river
into
the
city
if
this
be
the
same
channel
that
to
the
present
day
supplies
the
fields
which
occupy
so
much
of
the
site
of
the
old
city
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
work
for
several
miles
this
channel
is
cut
out
of
the
solid
rock
at
the
base
of
the
hills
and
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
irrigation
works
to
be
seen
in
india
no
details
are
given
of
the
wars
he
engaged
in
except
that
besides
his
campaigns
against
the
moors
he
took
goa
chaul
and
dabull
and
reduced
the
choromandel
side
of
the
peninsula
to
loyalty
and
obedience
to
his
rule
we
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
the
doings
of
bukka
ii
and
deva
raya
from
firishtah
than
from
nuniz
and
i
make
no
apology
for
quoting
copiously
from
the
former
author
whose
writings
throw
much
light
on
the
period
bukka
first
war
began
with
the
invasion
already
alluded
to
it
took
place
during
his
father
harihara
reign
apparently
about
the
month
of
december
rather
later
than
earlier
the
wide
cotton
plains
of
that
tract
are
only
passable
during
prolonged
dry
weather
and
the
prince
would
certainly
not
have
risked
an
advance
while
there
was
any
likelihood
of
rain
falling
bukka
son
accompanied
his
father
and
the
objective
was
the
country
of
the
doab
and
particularly
the
fortresses
of
mudkal
and
raichur
then
in
the
hands
of
the
bahmani
sultan
sultan
firuz
moved
to
meet
him
slaughtering
on
the
way
a
hindu
chief
or
zamindar
and
seven
or
eight
thousand
of
his
followers
who
had
always
been
very
troublesome
and
refractory
the
raya
had
advanced
to
the
northern
frontier
of
the
debatable
land
and
was
encamped
on
the
river
krishna
then
in
full
flood
having
large
bodies
of
troops
posted
to
oppose
the
passage
of
the
muhammadans
sultan
feroze
shaw
on
his
arrival
near
the
river
held
a
council
of
war
with
his
chief
officers
but
received
no
advice
that
to
him
appeared
satisfactory
while
the
sultan
was
debating
in
his
own
mind
how
to
act
cauzi
serauje
seeing
his
concern
offered
if
the
sultan
would
permit
him
to
cross
the
river
with
a
few
of
his
friends
whom
he
would
select
for
that
purpose
to
assassinate
dewal
roy
or
his
son
as
he
found
most
convenient
the
sultan
approving
the
measure
some
hundreds
of
hurdles
covered
with
leather
were
prepared
expeditiously
for
the
troops
to
cross
cauzi
serauje
with
seven
of
his
friends
disguised
as
holy
mendicants
proceeded
to
the
roy
camp
and
repaired
to
the
quarter
where
the
resided
here
the
cauzi
pretended
to
be
enraptured
with
a
courtesan
and
was
guilty
of
a
thousand
extravagances
to
support
his
character
in
the
evening
the
girl
having
adorned
herself
in
her
richest
ornaments
prepared
to
go
out
on
which
the
cauzi
like
a
jealous
and
distracted
lover
falling
at
her
feet
entreated
her
to
stay
or
let
him
attend
her
and
not
rend
his
heart
by
her
absence
the
woman
upon
this
informed
him
that
she
was
ordered
to
attend
an
entertainment
by
the
roy
son
and
durst
not
disobey
nor
could
she
take
him
with
her
as
only
musicians
and
dancers
would
be
admitted
the
cauzi
upon
this
replied
that
he
played
on
the
same
instrument
as
herself
and
had
besides
some
curious
accomplishments
that
would
highly
please
the
roy
son
the
thinking
him
in
jest
out
of
contempt
gave
him
her
mundal
and
desired
him
to
play
which
he
did
in
so
masterly
a
manner
that
she
was
delighted
saying
that
his
company
would
give
her
superiority
over
her
fellows
and
do
her
honour
with
the
roy
son
accordingly
he
with
his
companions
attended
the
girl
to
the
tents
of
the
young
roy
as
is
the
custom
of
dekkan
many
sets
of
loolies
and
were
ordered
to
perform
at
the
same
time
and
having
finished
their
parts
the
roy
son
called
for
the
players
and
mummers
the
now
obtained
leave
for
the
cauzi
and
one
of
his
companions
to
show
their
feats
having
assumed
the
dress
of
women
they
entered
ogling
and
smiling
and
so
well
imitated
the
mummers
in
playing
on
the
mundal
dancing
and
mimicry
that
the
roy
son
was
charmed
with
their
performances
at
length
they
each
drew
a
dagger
and
like
the
dancers
of
dekkan
continued
to
flourish
them
for
some
time
making
a
thousand
antic
postures
in
advancing
retreating
and
turning
round
at
last
suddenly
rushing
upon
the
roy
son
they
plunged
both
the
daggers
into
his
breast
afterwards
attacking
his
companions
their
remaining
friends
who
were
watching
without
the
tent
on
hearing
an
alarm
ripped
up
the
curtain
and
entered
to
assist
them
many
of
the
company
being
much
intoxicated
were
easily
put
to
death
the
cauzi
with
his
friends
extinguished
all
the
lights
and
making
their
escape
through
the
rent
mingled
with
the
crowd
the
outcry
soon
became
general
round
the
tents
great
confusion
ensued
and
various
reports
and
alarms
took
place
some
said
that
the
sultan
had
crossed
the
river
and
surprised
the
camp
others
that
one
of
his
chiefs
with
twelve
thousand
men
had
cut
off
both
the
roy
and
his
son
the
night
was
uncommonly
dark
and
the
camp
extended
near
ten
miles
so
that
circumstances
were
variously
reported
and
the
different
chiefs
ignorant
of
the
real
cause
of
the
alarm
contended
themselves
with
waiting
in
their
several
quarters
under
arms
about
four
thousand
of
the
sultan
troops
in
this
interim
crossed
the
river
in
boats
and
rafts
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
purpose
the
enemy
foot
stationed
to
oppose
the
passage
terrified
by
the
alarm
in
camp
and
the
approach
of
the
sultan
forces
fled
in
confusion
without
waiting
to
be
attacked
before
the
morning
feroze
shaw
had
crossed
the
river
with
his
whole
army
and
at
dawn
assaulted
the
enemy
camp
with
great
fury
dewul
roy
grieved
by
the
death
of
his
son
and
panic
struck
at
the
bravery
of
the
assailants
made
but
a
faint
resistance
before
sunrise
having
taken
up
his
son
corpse
he
fled
with
his
army
the
sultan
gained
immense
plunder
in
the
camp
and
pursued
him
to
the
vicinity
of
beejanuggur
several
actions
happened
on
the
way
all
of
which
were
fortunate
to
the
sultan
and
the
roads
were
heaped
up
with
the
bodies
of
the
slaughtered
hindoos
bukka
reached
vijayanagar
in
safety
and
took
refuge
behind
its
fortifications
while
the
sultan
sent
his
brother
ahmad
afterwards
sultan
whom
he
had
honoured
with
the
title
of
khankhanan
to
ravage
the
rich
districts
south
of
the
city
ahmad
fulfilled
his
instructions
and
returned
with
numberless
prisoners
and
amongst
them
many
brahmans
the
relatives
of
these
in
the
city
begged
the
aged
raya
harihara
still
alive
to
offer
ransom
and
after
much
negotiation
the
sultan
accepted
ten
lakhs
of
oons
and
agreed
to
the
execution
of
a
treaty
according
to
this
treaty
which
was
entered
into
a
few
months
before
the
close
of
the
hijra
year
a
few
months
before
september
the
boundaries
of
the
two
kingdoms
were
to
be
the
same
as
before
the
war
and
each
party
agreed
to
refrain
from
molesting
the
subjects
of
the
other
this
does
not
look
as
though
the
sultan
had
gained
any
very
material
advantage
in
the
campaign
since
the
true
boundary
was
always
a
subject
of
dispute
i
obtain
the
date
above
given
from
firishtah
sentence
in
a
few
months
after
the
conclusion
of
this
campaign
and
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
sultan
marched
to
punish
nersing
a
chief
who
had
raised
disturbances
on
the
borders
of
berar
the
maasir
passes
over
this
war
with
great
brevity
it
states
that
the
sultan
began
it
and
that
at
its
close
he
accepted
a
large
indemnity
and
promise
of
payment
of
annual
tribute
the
date
given
is
identical
not
long
after
this
war
but
certainly
not
before
october
harihara
ii
died
and
was
succeeded
by
bukka
his
son
we
have
little
to
guide
us
as
to
the
events
of
bukka
reign
but
firishtah
states
that
he
ceased
to
pay
tribute
to
firuz
shah
partly
owing
to
instigation
from
gujarat
malwa
and
khandeish
in
hijra
june
to
june
four
years
tribute
was
owing
but
the
sultan
took
no
notice
and
waited
for
a
more
convenient
time
bukka
was
followed
on
the
throne
of
vijayanagar
by
his

deva

the
date
of

coronation
is
fixed

towards
the

year
in
which
the
principal
actor
was
the

this

have

successor
his

the
story
relates
to
a
mad
adventure
of
the
raya
which
he
undertook
in
order
to
secure
for
himself
the
person
of
a
beautiful
girl
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
in
mudkal
his
desire
to
possess
her
attained
such
a
pitch
that
he
made
an
expedition
into
the
debatable
land
north
of
the
tungabhadra
for
the
sole
purpose
of
capturing
the
girl
and
adding
her
to
his
harem
i
have
already
shown
reasons
for
supposing
that
bukka
ii
was
a
man
at
his
accession
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
this
monarch
was
his
younger
brother
who
began
to
reign
in
november
his
escapade
must
be
narrated
in
full
as
told
by
firishtah
since
it
led
to
very
important
consequences
there
resided
in
the
town
of
mudkul
a
farmer
who
was
blessed
with
a
daughter
of
such
exquisite
beauty
that
the
creator
seemed
to
have
united
all
his
powers
in
making
her
perfect
this
attractive
person
was
educated
by
an
old
brahman
whose
admiration
of
her
led
him
to
think
that
she
would
prove
a
desirable
member
of
the
raya
household
he
proceeded
to
beejanuggur
and
being
introduced
to
the
roy
spoke
in
such
praise
of
the
beauty
and
accomplishments
of
the
young
maid
that
he
was
fired
with
the
desire
of
possessing
her
and
entreated
the
bramin
to
procure
her
for
him
of
her
parents
in
marriage
this
request
was
what
the
bramin
earnestly
wished
and
he
immediately
agreed
to
satisfy
him
upon
which
the
roy
despatched
him
with
rich
gifts
and
great
promises
of
favours
to
the
parents
and
the
title
of
ranee
or
princess
for
their
beautiful
daughter
the
bramin
lost
no
time
in
his
journey
and
upon
his
arrival
at
the
farmer
house
delivered
to
him
and
his
wife
the
roy
orders
that
they
should
repair
to
beejanuggur
with
their
daughter
the
parents
were
overjoyed
at
such
unexpected
good
fortune
and
calling
for
the
young
maid
laid
before
her
the
rich
gifts
of
the
roy
congratulated
her
on
being
soon
to
be
united
to
a
great
prince
and
attempted
to
throw
upon
her
neck
a
golden
collar
set
with
jewels
as
a
token
of
immediate
espousals
and
which
if
done
could
not
have
been
broken
off
the
beautiful
virgin
to
their
great
astonishment
drawing
her
neck
from
compliance
refused
to
receive
the
collar
and
observed
that
whoever
entered
the
harem
of
beejanuggur
was
afterwards
not
permitted
to
see
even
her
nearest
relations
and
friends
and
though
they
might
be
happy
to
sell
her
for
worldly
riches
yet
she
was
too
fond
of
her
parents
to
submit
to
eternal
absence
from
them
even
for
all
the
splendour
of
the
palace
of
beejanuggur
this
declaration
was
accompanied
with
affectionate
tears
which
melted
her
parents
who
rather
than
use
force
dismissed
the
bramin
with
all
his
gifts
and
he
returned
chagrined
and
disappointed
to
beejanuggur
when
the
bramin
arrived
at
beejanuggur
and
related
to
the
roy
the
failure
of
his
scheme
the
prince
love
became
outrageous
and
he
resolved
to
gratify
it
by
force
though
the
object
resided
in
the
heart
of
feroze
shaw
dominions
for
this
purpose
he
quitted
beejanuggur
with
a
great
army
on
pretence
of
going
the
tour
of
his
countries
and
upon
his
arrival
on
the
banks
of
the
river
tummedra
having
selected
five
thousand
of
his
best
horse
and
giving
the
reins
of
his
conduct
to
love
commanded
them
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
friends
to
march
night
and
day
with
all
expedition
to
mudkul
and
surrounding
the
village
where
pertal
lived
to
bring
her
prisoner
to
him
with
her
whole
family
without
injury
the
unexpected
however
happened
the
king
neglected
to
send
the
brahman
to
warn
pertal
family
and
on
the
arrival
of
news
at
mudkal
that
a
large
force
of
the
raya
troops
was
approaching
the
inhabitants
fled
and
amongst
them
the
girl
and
her
relatives
the
troops
therefore
resumed
but
on
the
way
looted
the
country
they
were
attacked
by
superior
forces
and
of
them
were
slain
this
led
to
a
war
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
the
year
the
winter
of
he
the
sultan
moved
in
great
force
and
arrived
near
beejanuggur
in
which
dewul
roy
had
shut
himself
up
an
assault
was
made
upon
the
city
and
the
sultan
got
possession
of
some
streets
which
however
he
was
obliged
to
quit
his
army
being
repulsed
by
the
carnatickehs
dewul
roy
encouraged
by
his
success
now
ventured
to
encamp
his
army
under
protection
of
the
walls
and
to
molest
the
royal
camp
as
the
mussulmauns
could
not
make
proper
use
of
their
cavalry
in
the
rocky
unevenness
of
ground
round
beejanuggur
they
were
somewhat
dispirited
during
this
sultan
feroze
shaw
was
wounded
by
an
arrow
in
the
hand
but
he
would
not
dismount
and
drawing
out
the
arrow
bound
up
the
wound
with
a
cloth
the
enemy
were
at
last
driven
off
by
the
valour
and
activity
of
ahmed
khan
and
khankhanan
and
the
sultan
moved
farther
from
the
city

a
convenient
plain
where
he
halted
till
his
wounded
men
were
recovered
he
halted
here
for
four
months
holding
the
raya
a
prisoner
in
his
own
capital
while
bodies
of
troops
harassed
and
wasted
the
country
south
of
vijayanagar
and
attacked
the
fortress
of
bankapur
the
convenient
plain
was
probably
in
the
open
and
rich
valley
near
the
town
of
hospett
south
of
the
city
for
the
sultan
could
not
have
ravaged
the
country
to
the
south
unless
he
had
been
master
of
the
whole
of
this
valley
for
many
miles
bankapur
was
taken
and
the
detached
forces
returned
bringing
with
them
hindu
prisoners
on
which
the
sultan
left
khankhanan
to
hold
vijayanagar
while
he
himself
attempted
to
reduce
the
fortress
of
adoni
the
strongest
in
possession
of
the
enemy
deva
raya
then
began
to
treat
for
peace
and
was
compelled
to
submit
to
conditions
to
the
last
degree
humiliating
he
agreed
to
give
the
sultan
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
indemnify
him
with
an
immense
treasure
and
to
cede
for
ever
the
fort
of
bankapur
though
the
roies
of
carnatic
had
never
yet
married
their
daughters
but
to
persons
of
their
own
cast
and
giving
them
to
strangers
was
highly
disgraceful
yet
dewul
roy
out
of
necessity
complied
and
preparations
for
celebrating
the
nuptials
were
made
by
both
parties
for
forty
days
communication
was
open
between
the
city
and
the
sultan
camp
both
sides
of
the
road
were
lined
with
shops
and
booths
in
which
the
jugglers
drolls
dancers
and
mimics
of
carnatic
displayed
their
feats
and
skill
to
amuse
passengers
khankhanan
and

with
the
customary
presents
of
a
bridegroom
went
to
beejanuggur
from
whence
at
the
expiration
of
seven
days
they
brought
the
bride
with
a
rich
portion
and
offerings
from
the
roy
to
the
sultan
camp
dewul
roy
having
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
see
the
sultan
feroze
shaw
with
great
gallantry
agreed
to
visit
him
with
his
bride
as
his
a
day
being
fixed
he
with
his
bride
proceeded
to
beejanuggur
leaving
the
camp
in
charge
of
khankhanan
on
the
way
he
was
met
by
dewul
roy
in
great
pomp
from
the
gate
of
the
city
to
the
palace
being
a
distance
of
six
miles
the
road
was
spread
with
cloth
of
gold
velvet
satin
and
other
rich
stuffs
the
two
princes
rode
on
horseback
together
between
ranks
of
beautiful
boys
and
girls
who
waved
plates
of
gold
and
silver
flowers
over
their
heads
as
they
advanced
and
then
threw
them
to
be
gathered
by
the
populace
after
this
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
made
offerings
both
men
and
women
according
to
their
rank
after
passing
through
a
square
directly
in
the
centre
of
the
city
the
relations
of
dewul
roy
who
had
lined
the
streets
in
crowds
made
their
obeisance
and
offerings
and
joined
the
cavalcade
on
foot
marching
before
the
princes
upon
their
arrival
at
the
palace
gate
the
sultan
and
roy
dismounted
from
their
horses
and
ascended
a
splendid
palanquin
set
with
valuable
jewels
in
which
they
were
carried
together
to
the
apartments
prepared
for
the
reception
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
when
dewul
roy
took
his
leave
and
retired
to
his
own
palace
the
sultan
after
being
treated
with
royal
magnificence
for
three
days
took
his
leave
of
the
roy
who
pressed
upon
him
richer
presents
than
before
given
and
attended
him
four
miles
on
his
way
when
he
returned
to
the
city
sultan
feroze
shaw
was
enraged
at
his
not
going
with
him
to
his
camp
and
said
to
meer
fuzzul
oollah
that
he
would
one
day
have
his
revenge
for
the
affront
offered
him
by
such
neglect
this
declaration
being
told
to
dewul
roy
he
made
some
insolent
remarks
so
that
notwithstanding
the
connection
of
family
their
hatred
was
not
calmed
firuz
returned
after
this
to
his
capital
and
sent
for
the
lovely
pertal
and
on
her
arrival
finding
that
her
beauty
surpassed
all
report
he
gave
her
in
marriage
to
his
eldest
son
hasan
khan
when
the
knot
was
tied
amid
great
rejoicings
and
princely
magnificence
the
lady
husband
is
described
by
firishtah
as
being
a
weak
and
dissipated
prince
he
was
heir
to
the
throne
but
was
easily
ousted
by
the
valiant
ahmad
khankhanan
and
lived
privately
at
firuzabad
entirely
devoted
to
redolence
and
pleasure
the
last
we
hear
of
him
is
that
his
usurping
uncle
ahmad
shah
treated
him
kindly
gave
him
the
palace
of
firozeabad
for
his
residence
with
an
ample
jaghire
estate
and
permission
to
hunt
or
take
his
pleasure
within
eight
miles
round
his
palace
without
restriction
to
time
or
form
hasan
was
more
satisfied
with
this
power
of
indulging
his
appetites
than
with
the
charge
of
empire
while
his
uncle
lived
he
enjoyed
his
ease
and
no
difference
ever
happened
between
them
but
he
was
afterwards
blinded
and
kept
confined
to
the
palace
of
firozeabad
this
must
have
been
after
deva
raya
lived
till
at
least
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
whom
nuniz
calls
visaya
and
who
he
says
reigned
six
years
the
last
extant
inscription
of
deva
raya
is
dated
in
the
first
of
his
successor
vijaya
in
vijaya
last
known
inscription
is
one
of
and
the
first
yet
known
of
his
successor
his
eldest
son
deva
raya
is
dated
monday
june
nuniz
gives
deva
raya
ii
a
reign
of
years
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
deva
raya
ii
began
to
reign
in
for
the
following
reason
the
informants
of
nuniz
stated
that
during
vijaya
reign
he
did
nothing
worth
relating
and
the
chronicle
records
that
during
the
reign
which
followed
namely
that
of
deva
raya
there
was
constant
warfare
now
we
have
it
from
firishtah
that
in
firuz
sultan
of
kulbarga
commenced
a
war
of
aggression
against
the
hindus
of
telingana
he
besieged
the
fortress
of
pangul
seventy
miles
of
adoni
for
a
period
of
two
years
but
the
attempt
to
reduce
it
ended
in
failure
owing
to
a
pestilence
breaking
out
amongst
both
men
and
horses
many
of
the
first
nobility
deserted
the
camp
and
tied
with
their
followers
to
their
jaghires
at
this
crisis
dewul
roy
collected
his
army
and
having
obtained
aid
from
the
surrounding
princes
even
to
the
raja
of
telingana
warangal
marched
against
the
sultan
with
a
vast
host
of
horse
and
foot
this
then
took
place
in
and
since
this
energetic
action
was
not
consonant
with
the
character
of
vijaya
the
faineant
sovereign
who
did
nothing
worth
recording
in
all
his
career
we
must
suppose
that
it
took
place
as
soon
as
deva
raya
his
successor
was
crowned
when
the
nobles
surrounding
him
he
was
i
believe
quite
young
when
he
began
to
reign
filled
with
zeal
and
ambition
roused
the
hindu
troops
and
in
the
king
name
plunged
into
war
against
their
country
hereditary
foe
if
this
be
correct
the
reign
of
deva
raya
granting
that
it
lasted
as
stated
by
nuniz
for
years
ended
in
now
the
chronicle
tells
us
a
story
of
how
this
deva
raya
son
and
successor
pina
rao
was
attacked
by
his
nephew
with
a
poisoned
dagger
and
died
from
the
effects
of
his
wounds
after
a
lapse
of
six
months
abdur
razzak
more
reliable
because
he
was
not
only
a
contemporary
but
was
at
vijayanagar
at
the
time
relates
the
same
anecdote
of
deva
raya
ii
himself
making
the
assassin
the
king
brother
and
definitely
fixing
the
date
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
event
occurred
on
some
day
between
november
and
april
the
outside
limits
of
razzak
visit
to
calicut
during
his
stay
at
which
place
he
says
it
happened
abdur
razzak
does
not
mention
the
king
death
and
this
therefore
had
not
supervened
up
to
the
time
of
the
traveller
leaving
the
capital
in
december
on
the
assumption
that
we
need
not
be
too
particular
about
nuniz
six
months
we
may
conclude
that
the
attack
was
made
about
the
month
of
april
and
that
deva
raya
ii
died
early
in
there
is
still
however
a
difficulty
as
will
be
noticed
below
inscriptions
giving
us
the
name
of
a
deva
raya
as
late
as
but
it
is
just
possible
that
this
was
another
king
of
the
same
name
putting
together
the
facts
given
above
we
find
that
the
years
of
the
reign
of
deva
raya
ii
lay
between
and
chapter
deva
raya
ii
to
or
a
fresh

the

in

on

fortress
pangul
and
the
troops
of
vijayanagar
marched
against
him
with
horse
foot
and
elephants
firuz
shah
gave
battle
forthwith
though
he
judged
his
forces
to
be
inferior
firishtah
does
not
mention
where
the
fight
took
place
meer
fuzzul
oollah
who
commanded
the
troops
of
islaam
charged
the
infidels
with
heroic
vigour
and
routing
their
center
proceeded
to
attack
their
right
wing
he
was
on
the
point
of
gathering
the
flowers
of
victory
when
one
of
his
own
attendants
bribed
for
the
purpose
by
dewul
roy
gave
him
a
mortal
wound
on
the
head
and
he
instantly
quaffed
the
sherbet
of
martyrdom
this
fatal
event
changed
the
fortune
of
the
day
the
sultan
was
defeated
and
with
the
utmost
difficulty
by
the
most
surprising
and
gallant
efforts
made
his
escape
from
the
field
the
hindoos
made
a
general
massacre
of
the
mussulmauns
and
erected
a
platform
with
their
heads
on
the
field
of
battle
they
followed
the
sultan
into
his
own
country
which
they
wasted
with
fire
and
sword
took
many
places
broke
down
many
mosques
and
holy
places
slaughtered
the
people
without

by
their
actions
seeming
to
discharge
the
treasured
malice
and
resentment
of
ages
sultan
firoze
shaw
in
the
exigence
of
distress
requested
aid
of
the
sultan
of
guzarat
who
having
but
just
acceded
to
the
throne
could
afford
none
at
last
fortune
took
a
turn
favourable
to
his
affairs
and
the
enemy
after
repeated
battles
were
expelled
from
his
dominions
by
the
sultan
brother
khankhanan
but
these
misfortunes
dwelt
on
the
mind
of
firoze
shaw
now
old
and
he
fell
into
a
lingering
disorder
and
lowness
of
spirits
the
sultan
desired
the
throne
for
his
son
hasan
husband
of
the
beautiful
pertal
but
on
ahmad
khankhanan
taking
up
arms
to
support
his
intended
usurpation
and
advancing
supported
by
most
of
the
nobles
to
the
capital
firuz
gave
way
and
nominated
him
sultan
in
his
stead
firuz
died
on
september
and
khankhanan
became
sultan
of
kulbarga
under
the
title
of
ahmad
shah
i
the
first
act
of
the
new
monarch
after
impressing
the
minds
of
his
people
with
affection
to
his
government
probably
that
is
after
an
interval
of
a
few
months
was
to
strengthen
his
army
in
order
to
take
revenge
for
the
invasions
of
the
raya
and
having
made
all
preparations
he
advanced
to
the
attack
deva
raya
generals
collected
their
troops
sent
for
aid
to
warangal
and
marched
to
the
tungabhadra
where
they
encamped
from
this
it
appears
that
they
had
retired
from
the
doab
after
their
successful
raid
the
sultan
arrived
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
opposite
the
hindu
camp
and
laagered
if
we
may
use
the
term
now
in
fashion
firishtah
says
that
he
surrounded
his
camp
with
carriages
carts
and
waggons
after
the
usage
of
room
turkey
in
europe
to
prevent
the
foot
from
making
here
he
halted
for
forty
days
we
are
now
therefore
probably
in
the
dry
season
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
for
if
the
river
had
been
in
flood
there
would
have
been
no
fear
of
the
enemy
crossing
it
in
the
early
months
of
the
christian
year
that
river
is
usually
shallow
in
the
open
country
east
of
the
hindu
capital
and
away
from
the
hills
that
surround
it
having
only
thin
streams
running
in
its
rocky
bed
indeed
firishtah
himself
tells
us
that
the
river
was
at
that
time
fordable
then
ensued
a
dramatic
episode
the
muhammadan
cavalry
had
crossed
the
river
and
devastated
the
country
of
the
raya
who
remained
inactive
and
the
sultan
determined
on
a
direct
frontal
attack
the
troops
of
warangal
deserted
the
raya
and
withdrew
early
in
the
morning
lodi
khan
aulum
khan
and
dillawer
khan
who
had
marched
during
the
night
and
forded
the
river
at
distance
reached
the
environs
of
the
enemy
camp
it
happened
that
the
roy
was
sleeping
attended
by
only
a
few
persons
in
a
garden
close
to
which
was
a
thick
plantation
of
a
body
of
the
mussulmauns
entered
the
garden
for
plunder
and
dewul
roy
being
alarmed
fled
almost
naked
into
the
plantation
here
he
was
found
by
the
soldiers
who
thought
him
only
a
common
person
and
having
loaded
him
with
a
bundle
of
canes
obliged
him
to
run
with
it
before
them
dewul
roy
rejoiced
at
his
being
undiscovered
held
his
peace
and
took
up
the
burden
readily
hoping
that
he
should
be
discharged
as
a
poor
person
or
be
able
to
make
his
escape
they
had
not
gone
far
when
the
alarm
of
sultan
ahmed
shaw
having
crossed
the
river
and
the
loss
of
the
roy
filled
the
camp
and
the
hindoos
began
to
disperse
the
sultan
entered
the
camp
and
dewul
masters
hoping
now
for
more
valuable
plunder
than
hastened
to
join
their
own
fronds
leaving
him
to
shift
for
himself
dewul
roy
ran
with
his
own
troops
and
about
noon
came
up
with
some
of
his
nobles
by
whom
he
was
recognised
and
received
with
great
joy
his
safety
being
made
known
his
army
rallied
into
some
order
but
as
he
regarded
the
late
accident
as
an
ill
omen
he
laid
aside
all
thoughts
of
engaging
in
the
field
and
fled
to
beejanuggur
ahmad
shaw
not
stopping
to
besiege
the
city
overran
the
open
country
and
wherever
he
came
put
to
death
men
women
and
children
without
mercy
contrary
to
the
compact
made
by
his
ancestor
mahummud
shaw
with
the
roies
of
beejanuggur
laying
aside
all
humanity
whenever
the
number
of
the
slain
amounted
to
twenty
thousand
he
halted
three
days
and
made
a
festival
in
celebration
of
the
bloody
work
he
broke
down
the
idol
temples
and
destroyed
the
colleges
of
the
bramins
during
these
operations
a
body
of
five
thousand
hindoos
enraged
to
desperation
at
the
destruction
of
their
country
and
the
insults
of
their
gods
united
in
taking
an
oath
to
sacrifice
their
lives
in
attempting
to
kill
the
sultan
as
the
grand
author
of
all
their
sufferings
for
this
purpose
they
employed
spies
to
observe
his
motions
that
they
might
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
action
it
happened
that
the
sultan
going
to
hunt
in
the
eagerness
of
chase
separated
from
the
body
of
his
attendants
and
advanced
near
twelve
miles
from
his
camp
the
devoted
infidels
informed
of
the
circumstance
immediately
hastened
to
intercept
him
and
arrived
in
sight
when
even
his
personal
attendants
about
two
hundred
moguls
were
at
some
distance
from
him
the
sultan
alarmed
galloped
on
in
hopes
of
gaining
a
small
mud
enclosure
which
stood
on
the
plain
as
a
fold
for
cattle
but
was
so
hotly
pursued
that
some
broken
ground
falling
in
his
way
he
was
not
able
to
cross
it
before
his
pursuers
came
up
luckily
some
archers
at
this
instant
arrived
to
his
aid
so
that
the
enemy
were
delayed
sufficiently
to
give
the
sultan
time
to
reach
the
enclosure
with
his
friends
the
infidels
attempted
to
enter
and
a
sharp
conflict
took
place
all
the
faithful
repeating
the
creed
of
testimony
and
swearing
to
die
rather
than
submit
their
little
troop
being
mostly
killed
and
wounded
the
assailants
advanced
close
to
the
wall
which
they
began
to
throw
down
with
pickaxes
and
hatchets
so
that
the
sultan
was
reduced
to
the
extremity
of
distress
at
this
critical
juncture
arrived
first
to
the
sultan
and
a
body
of
troops
with
whom
fearful
of
some
accident
having
happened
to
occasion
his
absence
he
had
left
the
camp
in
search
of
his
master
the
infidels
had
completed
a
wide
breach
and
were
preparing
to
enter
when
they
found
their
rear
suddenly
attacked
the
sultan
with
his
remaining
friends
joined
in
attacking
the
enemy
who
after
a
long
struggle
were
driven
off
the
field
with
a
loss
of
a
thousand
men
and
about
five
hundred
of
the
mussulmauns
attained
martyrdom
thus
the
sultan
by
the
almost
inspired
caution
of
acceded
as
it
were
a
second
time
from
the
depths
of
danger
to
the
enjoyment
of
empire
it
deserves
place
among
the
records
of
time
as
a
remarkable
event
that
two
sovereigns
at
the
head
of
armies
should
fall
into
such
danger
for
want
of
numbers
and
both
escape
uninjured
after
this
event
ahmed
shaw
having
laid
waste
the
whole
country
marched
to
beejanuggur
which
he
kept
so
closely
blocked
up
that
the
inhabitants
were
reduced
to
the
greatest
distress
when
dewul
roy
to
spare
his
people
sent
ambassadors
to
the
sultan
entreating
peace
to
which
he
consented
on
condition
that
he
would
send
the
tribute
of
as
many
years
as
he
had
neglected
to
pay
laden
on
his
best
elephants
and
conducted
by
his
son
with
his
drums
trumpets
and
all
the
other
insignia
of
state
to
his
camp
dewul
roy
unable
to
refuse
compliance
agreed
to
the
demands
and
sent
his
son
with
thirty
favourite
elephants
loaded
with
treasure
and
valuable
effects
the
sultan
sent
some
noblemen
to
meet
him
and
after
being
led
in
ceremony
through
the
market
and
great
streets
of
the
camp
he
was
brought
to
the
presence
the
sultan
after
embracing
permitted
him
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
his
throne
and
putting
on
his
shoulders
a
magnificent
robe
and
girding
him
with
a
sabre
set
with
jewels
gave
him
twenty
beautiful
horses
of
various
countries
a
male
elephant
dogs
for
the
chase
and
three
hawks
which
the
carnatickehs
were
till
then
strangers
to
the
use
of
he
then
marched
from
the
environs
of
beejanuggur
and
on
his
arrival
on
the
bank
of
the
kistnah
dismissed
the
roy
son
and
returned
to
koolburga
to
form
some
idea
of
the
date
of
this
cessation
of
hostilities
we
must
see
what
follows
in
firishtah
narrative
the
historian
states
that
during
the
year
of
the
sultan
return
to
kulbarga
there
was
a
grievous
famine
in
the
dakhan
and
the
next
year
also
no
rain
appearing
the
people
became
seditious
these
two
years
were
probably
extending
from
december
to
november
he
continues
in
the
year
the
sultan
marched
against
warangal
the
last
campaign
began
about
december
and
since
we
must
allow
some
months
for
ahmad
blockade
of
vijayanagar
which
resulted
in
his
reducing
the
inhabitants
to
a
state
of
starvation
so
that
the
raya
was
compelled
to
capitulate
the
date
for
the
end
of
the
war
can
not
be
safely
placed
earlier
than
the
winter
of
the
year
during
these
twelve
months
however
there
was
a
famine
and
failure
of
rain
so
that
the
sultan
may
have
been
able
to
traverse
the
cotton
plains
lying
between
vijayanagar
and
kulbarga
plains
quite
impassable
for
troops
in
wet
weather
somewhat
earlier
than
would
otherwise
have
been
the
case
the
sultan
next
war
took
place
in
when
he
advanced
against
warangal
over
the
undulating
plains
of
the
dakhan
then
rich
in
crop
and
was
completely
successful
the
hindu
kingdom
was
completely
and
for
ever
destroyed
the
english
date
usually
given
for
this
event
is
but
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
mistake
has
been
made
owing
to
the
use
of
imperfect
chronological
tables
by
those
who
have
written
on
the
subject
and
that
ahmad
shah
capture
of
warangal
may
have
taken
place
in
briggs
for
instance
calls
but
the
year
only
began
on
november
the
campaign
however
was
very
short
and
may
have
been
concluded
before
the
end
of
december
of
that
year
we
hear
nothing
more
from
firishtah
regarding
the
affairs
of
vijayanagar
till
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
ahmad
son
and
successor
which
began
on
sunday
february
the
day
of
sultan
ahmad
death
first
act
was
to
despatch
his
brother
muhammad
khan
with
a
powerful
army
against
deva
raya
of
vijayanagar
who
had
withheld
his
tribute
for
five
years
and
refused
to
pay
the
arrears
they
laid
waste
the
country
in
such
a
manner
that
the
roy
in
a
short
time
was
glad
to
procure
peace
by
giving
twenty
elephants
a
great
sum
of
money
and
two
hundred
female
slaves
skilled
in
music
and
dancing
besides
a
valuable
present
to
mahummud
khan
flushed
with
this
victory
and
in
command
of
a
large
force
prince
muhammad
rebelled
against
his
brother
and
firishtah
states
that
in
doing
so
he
obtained
aid
from
deva
raya
the
prince
took
mudkal
raichur
sholapur
bijapur
and
naldirak
from
the
sultan
governors
but
in
a
pitched
battle
with
the
royal
forces
was
completely
defeated
and
fled
shortly
afterwards
however
he
was
forgiven
by
his
generous
sovereign
and
the
fortress
and
territories
of
raichur
were
conferred
on
him
about
the
year
deva
raya
began
to
consider
more
seriously
his
situation
in
relation
to
his
powerful
neighbour
at
kulbarga
he
called
a
general
council
of
his
nobility
and
principal
bramins
observing
to
them
that
as
his
country
of
carnatic
in
extent
population
and
revenue
far
exceeded
the
territories
of
the
house
of
bahmenee
land
in
like
manner
his
army
was
far
more
numerous
wished
therefore
to
explore
the
cause
of
the
mussulmauns
successes
and
his
being
reduced
to
pay
them
tribute
some
said
that
the
superiority
of
the
mussulmauns
arose
from
two
circumstances
one
all
their
horses
being
strong
and
able
to
bear
more
fatigue
than
the
weak
lean
animals
of
carnatic
the
other
a
great
body
of
excellent
archers
always
kept
up
by
the
sultans
of
the
house
of
bahmenee
of
whom
the
roy
had
but
few
in
his
army
deo
roy
upon
this
gave
orders
for
the
entertainment
of
mussulmauns
in
his
service
allotted
them
jaghires
erected
a
mosque
for
their
use
in
the
city
of
beejanuggur
and
commanded
that
no
one
should
molest
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
religion
he
also
ordered
a
koraun
to
be
placed
before
his
throne
on
a
rich
desk
that
the
mussulmauns
might
perform
the
ceremony
of
obeisance
in
his
presence
without
sinning
against
their
laws
he
also
made
all
the
hindoo
soldiers
learn
the
discipline
of
the
bow
in
which
he
and
his
officers
used
such
exertions
that
he
had
at
length
two
thousand
mussulmauns
and
sixty
thousand
hindoos
well
skilled
in
archery
besides
eighty
thousand
horse
and
two
hundred
thousand
foot
armed
in
the
usual
manner
with
pikes
and
lances
on
a
day
which
must
have
been
between
november
and
april
a
desperate
attempt
was
made
on
the
life
of
king
deva
raya
by
one
of
his
closest
relatives
a
brother
according
to
abdur
razzak
a
nephew
according
to
nuniz
abdur
razzak
story
is
without
doubt
the
more
reliable
of
the
two
since
he
is
a
contemporary
witness
the
story
as
told
by
nuniz
is
given
in
the
chronicle
at
the
end
of
this
volume
abdur
razzak
was
ambassador
from
persia
to
calicut
and
vijayanagar
and
his
account
is
particularly
important
as
it
definitely
fixes
the
date
during
the
time
that
the
author
of
this
narrative
was
still
sojourning
at
calicut
november
to
april
there
happened
in
the
city
of
bidjanagar
an
extraordinary
and
most
singular
occurrence
the
king
brother
who
had
had
a
new
house
built
for
himself
invited
thither
the
monarch
and
the
principal
personages
of
the
empire
now
it
is
an
established
usage
of
the
infidels
never
to
eat
in
presence
of
each
other
the
men
who
were
invited
were
assembled
together
in
one
grand
hall
at
short
intervals
the
prince
either
came
in
person
or
sent
some
messenger
to
say
that
such
or
such
great
personage
should
come
and
eat
his
part
of
the
banquet
care
had
been
taken
to
bring
together
all
the
drums
kettledrums
trumpets
and
flutes
that
could
be
found
in
the
city
and
these
instruments
playing
all
at
the
same
time
made
a
tremendous
uproar
as
soon
as
the
individual
who
had
been
sent
for
entered
the
house
two
assassins
placed
in
ambush
sprang
out
upon
him
pierced
him
with
a
poignard
and
cut
him
in
pieces
after
having
removed
his
limbs
or
rather
the
fragments
of
his
body
they
sent
for
another
guest
who
once
having
entered
this
place
of
carnage
disappeared
in
consequence
of
the
noise
of
the
drums
the
clamour
and
the
tumult
no
one
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
this
manner
all
those
who
had
any
name
or
rank
in
the
state
were
slaughtered
the
prince
leaving
his
house
all
reeking
with
the
blood
of
his
victims
betook
himself
to
the
king
palace
and
addressing
himself
to
the
guards
who
were
stationed
in
that
royal
residence
invited
them
with
flattering
words
to
go
to
his
house
and
caused
them
to
follow
the
steps
of
the
so
that
the
palace
was
thus
deprived
of
all
its
defenders
this
villain
then
entered
into
the
king
presence
holding
in
his
hand
a
dish
covered
with
under
which
was
concealed
a
brilliant
poignard
he
said
to
the
monarch
hall
is
ready
and
they
only
wait
your
august
presence
the
king
following
the
maxim
which
declares
that
eminent
men
receive
an
inspiration
from
heaven
said
to
him
am
not
in
good
health
this
unnatural
brother
thus
losing
the
hope
of
enticing
the
king
to
his
house
drew
his
poignard
and
struck
him
therewith
several
violent
blows
so
that
the
prince
fell
at
the
back
of
his
throne
the
traitor
thus
believing
that
the
king
was
dead
left
there
one
of
his
confidants
to
cut
off
the
monarch
head
then
going
out
of
the
hall
he
ascended
the
portico
of
the
palace
and
thus
addressed
the
people
have
slain
the
king
his
brothers
and
such
and
such
emirs
brahmins
and
viziers
now
i
am
king
meanwhile
his
emissary
had
approached
the
throne
with
the
intention
of
cutting
off
the
king
head
but
that
prince
seizing
the
seat
behind
which
he
had
fallen
struck
the
wretch
with
it
with
so
much
violence
on
the
chest
that
he
fell
upon
his
back
the
king
then
with
the
help
of
one
of
his
guards
who
at
the
sight
of
this
horrible
transaction
had
hidden
himself
in
a
corner
slew
this
assassin
and
went
out
of
the
palace
by
way
of
the
harem
his
brother
still
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hall
of
council
invited
the
multitude
to
recognise
him
as
their
king
at
that
moment
the
monarch
cried
out
am
alive
i
am
well
and
safe
seize
that
wretch
the
whole
crowd
assembled
together
threw
themselves
upon
the
guilty
prince
and
put
him
to
death
the
only
one
who
escaped
was
danaik
the
vizier
who
previously
to
this
sad
event
had
gone
on
a
voyage
to
the
frontier
of
ceylon
the
king
sent
a
courier
to
him
to
invite
him
to
return
and
informed
him
of
what
had
just
occurred
all
those
who
had
in
any
way
aided
in
the
conspiracy
were
put
to
death
men
in
great
numbers
were
slain
flayed
burnt
alive
and
their
families
entirely
exterminated
the
man
who
had
brought
the
letters
of
invitation
was
put
to
the
last
degree
of
torture
nuniz
states
that
the
king
died
six
months
later
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
but
abdur
razzak
declares
that
he
was
presented
in
person
to
deva
raya
about
the
month
of
december
the
name
of
deva
son
is
not
given
by
nuniz
nor
yet
the
length
of
his
reign
he
only
states
that
he
did
nothing
worth
relating
except
to
give
enormous
charities
to
temples
this
king
again
was
succeeded
by
a
son
called
verupaca
rao
who
must
be
identical
with
virupaksha
and
nuniz
dates
from
his
reign
the
commencement
of
the
troubles
that
led
to
the
usurpation
of
narasimha
and
the
downfall
of
the
first
dynasty
but
before
putting
together
the
confusing
records
of
this
period
i
must
revert
to
the
events
of
the
year
at
this
period
says
abdur
razzak
referring
to
the
second
half
of
the
year
danaik
the
vizier
set
out
on
an
expedition
into
the
kingdom
of
kalbarga
the
reasons
which
had
led
to
this
invasion
were
as
follows
sultan
had
heard
of
the
treacherous
attempt
to
kill
the
king
of
vijayanagar
and
the
murder
of
the
nobles
and
principal
people
and
he
had
sent
a
message
to
the
king
demanding
payment
of
seven
lakhs
of
varahas
as
he
thought
the
moment
auspicious
for
an
attempt
to
crush
the
kingdom
the
king
of
bidjanagar
was
equally
troubled
and
irritated
by
the
receipt
of
such
a
message
but
he
sent
a
brave
answer
and
prepared
for
war
troops
were
sent
out
on
both
sides
which
made
great
ravages
on
the
frontiers
of
the
two
kingdoms
danaik
after
having
nit
de
an
invasion
upon
the
frontiers
of
the
country
of
kalbarga
and
taken
several
unfortunate
prisoners

retraced

was
killed
by
a

was
accepted
a
treaty
was
executed
and
the
prisoners
returned
with
the
tribute
and
added
presents
and
till
the
end
of
deva
raya
reign
both
parties
observed
their
agreement
from
the
terms
of
the
agreement
we
gather
that
though
firishtah
does
not
expressly
mention
it
tribute
had
been
demanded
by
the
sultan
and
this
confirms
the
account
given
by
abdur
razzak
it
also
shows
why
the
danaik
in
abdur
razzak
narrative
had
not
returned
covered
with
glory
but
merely
having
taken
several
unfortunate
prisoners
had
retraced
his
steps
the
campaign
must
have
been
of
short
duration
since
while
it
began
in
may
to
april
according
to
firishtah
it
was
over
before
december
when
abdur
razzak
left
vijayanagar
the
narrative
being
thus
brought
down
to
the
close
of
the
year
let
us
before
passing
on
turn
to
other
records
and
see
what
they
tell
us
about
the
reign
of
deva
raya
ii
i
have
already
stated
that
he
appears
to
have
been
very
young
at
his
accession
in
in
he
had
already
reigned
years
now
the
hakluyt
translation
of
abdur
razzak
chronicle
states
that
razzak
saw
king
deva
raya
ii
in
and
the
india
office
copy
contains
the
additional
information
that
the
king
was
then
exceedingly
young
i
am
not
aware
which
version
is
the
more
accurate
but
even
if
these
added
words
be
accepted
as
part
of
the
original
the
difficulty
is
capable
of
being
explained
away
by
the
supposition
that
perhaps
the
ambassador
was
presented
to
one
of
the
princes
and
not
to
the
king
himself
the
king
appears
to
have
been
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
traveller
was
not
an
impostor
in
representing
himself
as
an
envoy
from
persia
and
may
have
refrained
from
granting
a
personal
interview
several
inscriptions
of
the
reign
are
extant
one
records
a
proclamation
made
in
the
king
name
in
according
to
another
bearing
a
date
corresponding
to
wednesday
october
in
the
same
year
he
caused
a
jain
temple
to
be
erected
in
the
capital
in
a
street
called
the
pan
supari
bazaar
this
temple
is
situated
of
the
temple
marked
as
no
on
the
government
map
it
is
within
the
enclosure
of
the
royal
palace
and
close
to
the
rear
of
the
elephant
stables
still
standing
the
king
is
honoured
in
this
inscription
with
the
full
imperial
title
of
maharajadhiraja
rajaparamesvara
the
site
of
this
bazaar
is
thus
definitely
established
it
lay
on
either
side
of
the
road
which
ran
along
the
level
dry
ground
direct
from
the
palace
gate
near
the
temple
of
hazara
ramasvami
in
a
direction
to
join
the
road
which
now
runs
to
the
tungabhadra
ferry
through
the
fortified
gate
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
immediately
opposite
anegundi
it
passed
along
the
north
side
of
the
kallamma
and
rangasvami
temples
leaving
the
imperial
office
enclosure
with
its
lofty
walls
and
and
the
elephant
stables
on
the
left
skirted
the
jain
temple
and
the
temple
numbered
on
the
plan
and
passed
along
under
the
rocky
hills
that
bound
this
plain
on
the
north
till
it
debouched
on
the
main
road
above
mentioned
this
street
would
be
the
direct
approach
from
the
old
city
of
anegundi
to
the
king
palace
in
the
king
made
a
grant
to
a
temple
far
in
the
south
in
the
tanjore
district
there
are
two
inscriptions
of
his
reign
dated
respectively
in
and
at
padavedu
in
north
arcot
if
as
stated
by
nuniz
king
deva
raya
ii
died
a
few
months
after
his
attempted
assassination
and
if
abdur
razzak
saw
him
in
december
we
are
led
to
the
belief
that
he
died
early
in
definite
proof
is
however
wanting
other
inscriptions
must
be
carefully
examined
before
we
can
arrive
at
any
certain
conclusion
thus
an
inscription
at
sravana
belgola
of
date
corresponding
to
tuesday
may
published
by
professor
kielhorn
relates
to
the
death
on
that
day
of
pratapa
deva
raya
and
as
it
is
couched
in
very
curious
and
interesting
terms
i
give
the
translation
in
full
in
the
evil
year
kshaya
in
the
wretched
month
second
vaisakha
on
a
miserable
tuesday
in
a
fortnight
which
was
the
reverse
of
bright
on
the
fourteenth
day
the
unequalled
store
of
valour
pratapa
deva
raya
alas
met
with
death
but
since
royal
titles
are
not
given
to
the
deceased
he
may
have
been
only
a
prince
of
the
blood
an
inscription
at
tanjore
also
dated
in
mentions
the
name
deva
raya
but
gives
no
further
royal
titles
than
the
biruda
lord
of
the
four
oceans
an
inscription
bearing
date
corresponding
to
saturday
august
at
conjeeveram
records
a
grant
by
a
king
called
vira
pratapa
raya
to
whom
full
royal
titles
are
given
it
is
provoking
that
nuniz
omits
the
name
of
the
successor
of
deva
raya
as
known
to
tradition
in
the
sixteenth
century
for
this
might
have
helped
us
to
a
decision
at
present
it
looks
as
though
there
had
been
a
deva
raya
iii
reigning
from
to
but
this
point
can
not
as
yet
be
settled
rice
has
shown
that
one
of
the

of

was

be

to

narrative
for
a
time
in
order
to
acquire
some
idea
of
the
appearance
and
condition
of
the
great
city
of
vijayanagar
in
these
days
we
have
already
noticed
that
as
early
as
sultan
mujahid
of
kulbarga
had
heard
so
much
of
the
beauty
of
this
capital
that
he
desired
to
see
it
and
it
had
grown
in
importance
and
grandeur
during
the
succeeding
about
the
year
or
there
visited
vijayanagar
one
nicolo
an
italian
commonly
called
nicolo
conti
or
nicolo
dei
conti
and
if
he
was
not
the
earliest
european
visitor
he
was
at
least
the
earliest
that
we
know
of
whose
description
of
the
place
has
survived
to
this
day
his
visit
must
have
taken
place
shortly
after
the
accession
of
deva
raya
ii
nicolo
never
apparently
wrote
anything
himself
his
stories
were
recorded
in
latin
by
poggio
bracciolini
the
secretary
for
his
master
information
translated
into
portuguese
they
were
from
the
portuguese
into
italian
by
ramusio
who
searched
for
but
failed
to
obtain
a
copy
of
the
original
in
latin
this
original
was
first
published
in
by
the
abbe
oliva
of
paris
under
the
title
bracciolini
de
varietate
fortunae
liber
quatuor
nicolo
on
reaching
india
visited
first
the
city
of
cambaya
in
gujarat
after
twenty
days
sojourn
there
he
passed
down
the
coast
to
pacamuria
probably
barkur
and
helly
which
is
the
mount
or
cabo
of
later
writers
thence
he
travelled
inland
and
reached
the
raya
capital
vijayanagar
which
he
calls
bizenegalia
he
begins
his
description
thus
the
great
city
of
bizenegalia
is
situated
near
very
steep
mountains
the
circumference
of
the
city
is
sixty
miles
its
walls
are
carried
up
to
the
mountains
and
enclose
the
valleys
at
their
foot
so
that
its
extent
is
thereby
increased
in
this
city
there
are
estimated
to
be
ninety
thousand
men
fit
to
bear
arms
i
must
here
interpose
a
correction
there
were
no
mountains
properly
so
called
at
vijayanagar
only
a
confused
and
tumbled
mass
of
rocky
hills
some
rising
to
considerable
altitude
the
extent
of
its
lines
of
defences
was
extraordinary
lofty
and
massive
stone
walls
everywhere
crossed
the
valleys
and
led
up
to
and
mounted
over
the
hillsides
the
outer
lines
stretched
unbroken
across
the
level
country
for
several
miles
the
hollows
and
valleys
between
the
heights
were
filled
with
habitations
poor
and
squalid
doubtless
in
most
instances
but
interspersed
with
the
dwellings
of
the
nobles
merchants
and
upper
classes
of
the
vast
community
except
where
the
elaborately
constructed
of
the
rayas
enabled
the
land
to
be
irrigated
and
in
these
parts
rich
gardens
and
woods
and
luxurious
crops
of
rice
and
abounded
here
and
there
were
wonderfully
carved
temples
and
fanes
to
hindu
deities
with
brahmanical
colleges
and
schools
attached
to
the
more
important
amongst
their
number
as
to
the
appearance
of
the
scenery
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
the
description
given
in
by
a
distinguished
geologist
lieutenant
newbold
the
whole
of
the
extensive
site
occupied
by
the
ruins
of
bijanugger
on
the
south
bank
of
the
tumbuddra
and
of
its
suburb
annegundi
on
the
northern
bank
is
occupied
by
great
bare
piles
and
bosses
of
granite
and
granitoidal
gneiss
separated
by
rocky
defiles
and
narrow
rugged
valleys
encumbered
by
precipitated
masses
of
rock
some
of
the
larger
valleys
are
irrigated
by
aqueducts
from
the
river
the
peaks
tors
and
of
bijanugger
and
annegundi
indent
the
horizon
in
picturesque
confusion
and
are
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
more
artificial
ruins
of
the
ancient
metropolis
of
the
deccan
which
are
usually
constructed
with
blocks
quarried
from
their
sides
and
vie
in
grotesqueness
of
outline
and
massiveness
of
character
with
the
alternate
airiness
and
solidity
exhibited
by
nature
in
the
logging
stones
and
columnar
piles
and
in
the
walls
of
prodigious
cuboidal
blocks
of
granite
which
often
crest
and
top
her
massive
domes
and
ridges
in
natural
cyclopean
masonry
the
remains
of
palaces
temples
walls
and
gateways
are
still
to
be
seen
and
these
abound
not
only
on
the
site
of
vijayanagar
proper
but
also
on
the
north
side
of
the
swiftly
rushing
river
where
stood
the
stately
citadel
of
anegundi
the
mother
of
the
the
population
of
this
double
city
was
immense
and
the
area
occupied
by
it
very
extensive
from
the
last
fortification
to
the
south
beyond
the
present
town
of
hospett
to
the
extreme
point
of
the
defences
of
anegundi
on
the
north
the
distance
is
about
twelve
miles
from
the
extreme
western
line
of
walls
in
the
plain
to
the
last
of
the
eastern
works
amongst
the
hills
lying
in
the
direction
of
daroji
and
kampli
the
interval
measures
about
ten
miles
within
this
area
we
find
the
remains
of
the
structures
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
hovels
have
disappeared
and
the
debris
lies
many
feet
thick
over
the
old
but
the
channels
are
still
in
working
order
and
wherever
they
exist
will
be
found
rich
crops
tall
and
stately
trees
and
a
tangle
of
luxuriant
vegetation
on
the
rocks
above
are
the
ruins
of
buildings
and
temples
and
walls
and
in
many
places
small
shrines
stand
out
built
on
the
jutting
edges
of
great
boulders
or
on
the
pinnacles
of
lofty
crags
in
places
that
would
seem
inaccessible
to
anything
but
monkeys
and
birds
in
the
central
enclosure
are
the
remains
of
great
structures
that
must
once
have
been
remarkable
for
their
grandeur
and
dignity
these
immediately
surrounded
the
king
palace
but
in
the
muhammadans
worked
their
savage
will
upon
them
with
such
effect
that
only
the
crumbling
ruins
of
the
more
massive
edifices
amongst
them
still
stand
the
site
of
the
palace
itself
is
marked
by
a
large
area
of
ground
covered
with
heaps
of
broken
blocks
crushed
masonry
and
fragments
of
sculpture
not
one
stone
being
left
upon
another
in
its
original
position
to
return
to
nicolo
he
continues
the
inhabitants
of
this
region
marry
as
many
wives
as
they
please
who
are
burnt
with
their
dead
husbands
their
king
is
more
powerful
than
all
the
other
kings
of
india
he
takes
to
himself
wives
of
whom
follow
him
on
foot
wherever
he
may
go
and
are
employed
solely
in
the
service
of
the
kitchen
a
like
number
more
handsomely
equipped
ride
on
horseback
the
remainder
are
carried
by
men
in
litters
of
whom
or
are
selected
as
his
wives
on
condition
that
at
his
death
they
should
voluntarily
burn
themselves
with
him
which
is
considered
to
be
a
great
honour
for
them
at
a
certain
time
of
the
year
their
idol
is
carried
through
the
city
placed
between
two
chariots
in
which
are
young
women
richly
adorned
who
sing
hymns
to
the
god
and
accompanied
by
a
great
concourse
of
people
many
carried
away
by
the
fervour
of
their
faith
cast
themselves
on
the
ground
before
the
wheels
in
order
that
they
may
be
crushed
to
death
a
mode
of
death
which
they
say
is
very
acceptable
to
their
god
others
making
an
incision
in
their
side
and
inserting
a
rope
thus
through
their
body
hang
themselves
to
the
chariot
by
nay
of
ornament
and
thus
suspended
and
accompany
their
idol
this
kind
of
sacrifice
they
consider
the
best
and
most
acceptable
of
all
thrice
in
the
year
they
keep
festivals
of
especial
solemnity
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
males
and
females
of
all
ages
having
bathed
in
the
rivers
or
the
sea
clothe
themselves
in
new
garments
and
spend
three
entire
days
in
singing
dancing
and
feasting
on
another
of
these
festivals
they
fix
up
within
their
temples
and
on
the
outside
on
the
roofs
an
innumerable
number
of
lamps
of
oil
of
susimanni
which
are
kept
burning
day
and
night
on
the
third
which
lasts
nine
days
they
set
up
in
all
the
highways
large
beams
like
the
masts
of
small
ships
to
the
upper
part
of
which
are
attached
pieces
of
very
beautiful
cloth
of
various
kinds
interwoven
with
gold
on
the
summit
of
each
of
these
beams
is
each
day
placed
a
man
of
pious
aspect
dedicated
to
religion
capable
of
enduring
all
things
with
equanimity
who
is
to
pray
for
the
favour
of
god
these
men
are
assailed
by
the
people
who
pelt
them
with
oranges
lemons
and
other
odoriferous
fruits
all
which
they
bear
most
patiently
there
are
also
three
other
festival
days
during
which
they
sprinkle
all
even
the
king
and
queen
themselves
with
saffron
water
placed
for
that
purpose
by
the
wayside
this
is
received
by
all
with
much
laughter
the
first
of
these
festivals
may
be
the
kanarese
new
year
day
which
domingo

in
his

asserts
to
have

they
themselves
have
two
eyes
and
that
we
have
but
one
because
they
consider
that
they
excel
all

in
prudence
the
inhabitants
of
cambay
alone
use

all

write
on
the

of

they

a
vast

consist
of

and
upwards
abdur
razzak
also
visited
the
city
during
the
reign
of
deva
raya
but
about
twenty
years
later
than
conti
he
was
entrusted
with
an
embassy
from
persia
and
set
out
on
his
mission
on
january
at
the
beginning
of
november
that
year
he
arrived
at
calicut
where
he
resided
till
the
beginning
of
april
being
there
he
was
summoned
to
vijayanagar
travelled
thither
and
was
in
the
great
city
from
the
end
of
april
till
the
december
of
the
same
year
the
following
passage
explains
why
he
left
calicut
on
a
sudden
a
man
arrived
who
brought
me
the
intelligence
that
the
king
of
bidjanagar
who
holds
a
powerful
empire
and
a
mighty
dominion
under
his
sway
had
sent
him
to
the
sameri
as
delegate
charged
with
a
letter
in
which
he
desired
that
he
would
send
on
to
him
the
ambassador
of
his
majesty
the
happy
khakhan
the
king
of
persia
although
the
sameri
is
not
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
king
of
bidjanagar
he
nevertheless
pays
him
respect
and
stands
extremely
in
fear
of
him
since
if
what
is
said
is
true
this
latter
prince
has
in
his
dominions
three
hundred
ports
each
of
which
is
equal
to
calicut
and
on
terra
firma
his
territories
comprise
a
space
of
three
months
journey
in
obedience
to
this
request
abdur
razzak
left
calicut
by
sea
and
went
to
mangalore
which
forms
the
frontier
of
the
kingdom
of
bidjanagar
he
stayed
there
two
or
three
days
and
then
journeyed
inland
passing
many
towns
and
amongst
them
a
place
where
he
saw
a
small
but
wonderful
temple
made
of
bronze
at
length
i
came
to
a
mountain
whose
summit
reached
the
skies
having
left
this
mountain
and
this
forest
behind
me
i
reached
a
town
called
belour
the
houses
of
which
were
like
palaces
here
he
saw
a
temple
with
exquisite
sculpture
at
the
end
of
the
month
of
we
arrived
at
the
city
of
bidjanagar
the
king
sent
a
numerous
cortege
to
meet
us
and
appointed
us
a
very
handsome
house
for
our
residence
his
dominion
extends
from
the
frontier
of
serendib
to
the
extremities
of
the
country
of
kalbergah
from
the
krishna
river
to
cape
comorin
one
sees
there
more
than
a
thousand
elephants
in
their
size
resembling
mountains
and
in
their
form
resembling
devils
the
troops
amount
in
number
to
eleven
lak
one
might
seek
in
vain
throughout
the
whole
of
hindustan
to
find
a
more
absolute
rai
for
the
monarchs
of
this
country
bear
the
title
of
rai
the
city
of
bidjanagar
is
such
that
the
pupil
of
the
eye
has
never
seen
a
place
like
it
and
the
ear
of
intelligence
has
never
been
informed
that
there
existed
anything
to
equal
it
in
the
world
it
is
built
in
such
a
manner
that
seven
citadels
and
the
same
number
of
walls
enclose
each
other
around
the
first
citadel
are
stones
of
the
height
of
a
man
one
half
of
which
is
sunk
in
the
ground
while
the
other
half
rises
above
it
these
are
fixed
one
beside
the
other
in
such
a
manner
that
no
horse
or
foot
soldier
could
boldly
or
with
ease
approach
the
citadel
the
position
of
these
seven
walls
and
gates
have
long
been
a
puzzle
to
me
but
i
hazard
the
following
explanation
the
traveller
approached
from
the
southwest
and
the
first
line
of
wall
that
he
saw
must
have
been
that
on
the
neck
between
the
two
hills
of
hospett
paes
also
describes
this
outer
as
that
seen
by
all
travellers
on
their
first
arrival
from
the
coast
after
being
received
at
this
razzak
must
have
passed
down
the
slope
through
cultivated
fields
houses
and
gardens
to
the
entrance
of
hospett
where
the
second
line
of
fortification
barred
the
way
and
since
that
town
was
not
then
thickly
populated
the
same
features
would
meet
his
eye
till
he
passed
a
third
line
of
wall
on
the
north
side
of
that
town
from
this
point
the
houses
became
thicker
probably
forming
a
long
street
with
shops
on
either
side
of
the
road
leading
thence
to
the
capital
the
fourth
line
of
wall
with
a
strong
gateway
is
to
be
seen
on
the
south
of
the
present
village
of
malpanagudi
where
several
remains
of
old
buildings
exist
and
notably
a
handsome
stone
well
once
probably
belonging
to
the
of
some
noble
or
chief
officer
the
fifth
line
is
on
the
north
of
malpanagudi
and
here
the
great
gateway
still
stands
though
the
wall
is
much
damaged
and
destroyed
the
sixth
line
is
passed
just
to
the
south
of
the
kamalapur
tank
the
seventh
or
inner
line
is
the
great
wall
still
to
be
seen
in
fairly
good
repair
north
of
that
village
this
last
surrounded
the
palace
and
the
government
buildings
the
space
enclosed
measuring
roughly
a
mile
from
north
to
south
and
two
miles
and
a
quarter
from
east
to
west
the
remains
of
the
upright
stones
alluded
to
by
razzak
were
seen
by
domingo
paes
in
i
believe
that
they
have
now
disappeared
razzak
describes
the
outer
citadel
as
a
fortress
of
round
shape
built
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
and
constructed
of
stones
and
lime
it
has
very
solid
gates
the
guards
of
which
are
constantly
at
their
post
and
examine
everything
with
severe
inspection
this
passage
must
refer
to
the
outer
line
of
wall
since
razzak
seventh
fortress
is
the
innermost
of
all
the
guards
at
the
gates
were
doubtless
the
officers
entrusted
with
the
collection
of
the
octroi
duties
sir
henry
elliot
translation
iv
adds
to
the
passage
as
quoted
the
words
they
collect
the
jizyat
or
taxes
this
system
of
collecting
octroi
dues
at
the
gates
of
principal
towns
lasted
till
recent
days
having
only
been
abolished
by
the
british
government
the
seventh
fortress
is
to
the
north
and
is
the
palace
of
the
king
the
distance
between
the
opposite
gates
of
the
outer
fortress
north
and
south
is
two
parasangs
and
the
same
east
to
west
the
space
which
separates
the
first
fortress
from
the
second
and
up
to
the
third
fortress
is
filled
with
cultivated
fields
and
with
houses
and
gardens
in
the
space
from
the
third
to
the
seventh
one
meets
a
numberless
crowd
of
people
many
shops
and
a
bazaar
by
the
king
palace
are
four
bazaars
placed
opposite
each
other
on
the
north
is
the
portico
of
the
palace
of
the
rai
above
each
bazaar
is
a
lofty
arcade
with
a
magnificent
gallery
but
the
of
the
king
palace
is
elevated
above
all
the
rest
the
bazaars
are
extremely
long
and
broad
roses
are
sold
everywhere
these
people
could
not
live
without
roses
and
they
look
upon
them
as
quite
as
necessary
as
food
each
class
of
men
belonging
to
each
profession
has
shops
contiguous
the
one
to
the
other
the
jewellers
sell
publicly
in
the
bazaars
pearls
rubies
emeralds
and
diamonds
in
this
agreeable
locality
as
well
as
in

sees
numerous
running
streams
and
canals
formed
of
chiselled
stone
polished
and
smooth
on
the
left
of
the
sultan
portico
rises
the
dewan

is
extremely
large

behind

palace
are
the

to

of
the
said

is
the

this
empire
contains
so
great
a
population
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
an
idea
of
it
without
entering
into
extensive
details
in
the
king
palace
are
several
cells
like
basins
filled
with
bullion
forming
one
mass
opposite
the
he
continues
is
the
house
of
the
elephants
each
elephant
has
a
separate
compartment
the
walls
of
which
are
extremely
solid
and
the
roof
composed
of
strong
pieces
of
wood
opposite
the

is
the
house
of
the

where
are
stationed
twelve
thousand

of
bazaar

is
more
than
three
hundred

the
author
took
up
his
abode
in
a
lofty
house
which
had
been
allotted
to
him
on
the
muharram
may
one
day
some
messengers
sent
from
the
palace
of
the
king
came
to
see
me
and
at
the
close
of
the
same
day
i
presented
myself
at
court
the
prince
was
seated
in
a
hall
surrounded
by
the
most
imposing
attributes
of
state
right
and
left
of
him
stood
a
numerous
crowd
of
men
arranged
in
a
circle
the
king
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
green
satin
around
his
neck
he
wore
a
collar
composed
of
pearls
of
beautiful
water
and
other
splendid
gems
he
had
an
olive
complexion
his
frame
was
thin
and
he
was
rather
tall
on
his
cheeks
might
be
seen
a
slight
down
hut
there
was
no
beard
on
his
chin
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
extremely
pleasing
if
report
speaks
truly
the
number
of
the
princesses
and
concubines
amounts
to
seven
hundred
abdur
razzak
gives
a
glowing
account
of
the
brilliancy
of
a
great
festival
of
which
he
was
a
spectator
while
in
the
capital
he
calls
it
the
mahanavami
festival
but
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
he
was
not
mistaken
since
he
declares
that
it
took
place
in
the
month
rajab
october
to
november
the
hindus
celebrate
the
mahanavami
by
a
nine
days
festival
beginning
on
asvina
sukla
in
native
reckoning
that
is
on
the
day
following
the
new
moon
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
month
asvina
while
the
new
day
at
that
period
was
the
first
day
of
the
following
month
karttika
if
the
year
began
as
it
certainly
did
at
vijayanagar
in
the
time
of
paes
eighty
years
later
on
karttika
but
the
new
moon
of
rajab
in
corresponded
to
the
new
moon
of
karttika
not
to
that
of
asvina
either
therefore
the
festival
which
he
witnessed
was
the
new
year
day
festival
or
the
traveller
was
in
error
in
giving
the
month
rajab
it
seems
most
probable
that
the
former
was
the
case
because
he
apparently
makes
the
festival
one
of
only
three
days
duration
whereas
the
mahanavami
as
its
name
implies
was
a
nine
days
feast
but
there
is
also
another
difficulty
the
mahanavami
celebrations
began
with
the
new
moon
whereas
razzak
says
that
the
festival
he
saw
began
with
the
full
moon
this
however
may
have
been
due
to
a
slip
of
the
pen
however
that
may
be
he
certainly
was
a
spectator
of
a
brilliant
scene
and
i
append
his
account
of
it
in
pursuance
of
orders
issued
by
the
king
of
bidjanagar
the
generals
and
principal
personages
from
all
parts
of
his
empire
presented
themselves
at
the
palace
they
brought
with
them
a
thousand
elephants
which
were
covered
with
brilliant
armour
and
with
castles
magnificently
adorned
during
three
consecutive
days
in
the
month
of
redjeb
the
vast
space
of
land
magnificently
decorated
in
which
the
enormous
elephants
were
congregated
together
presented
the
appearance
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
or
of
that
compact
mass
which
will
be
assembled
together
at
the
day
of
the
resurrection
over
this
magnificent
space
were
erected
numerous
pavilions
to
the
height
of
three
four
or
even
five
storeys
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
figures
in
relief
some
of
these
pavilions
were
arranged
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
turn
rapidly
round
and
present
a
new
face
at
each
moment
a
new
chamber
or
a
new
hall
presented
itself
to
the
view
in
the
front
of
this
place
rose
a
palace
with
nine
pavilions
magnificently
ornamented
in
the
ninth
the
king
throne
was
set
up
in
the
seventh
was
allotted
a
place
to
the
humble
author
of
this
narrative
between
the
palace
and
the
pavilions
were
musicians
and
storytellers
girls
were
there
in
magnificent
dresses
dancing
behind
a
pretty
curtain
opposite
the
king
there
were
numberless
performances
given
by
jugglers
who
displayed
elephants
marvellously
trained
during
three
consecutive
days
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
royal
festival
was
prolonged
in
a
style
of
the
greatest
magnificence
fireworks
games
and
amusements
went
on
on
the
third
day
the
writer
was
presented
to
the
king
the
throne
which
was
of
extraordinary
size
was
made
of
gold
and
enriched
with
precious
stones
of
extreme
value
before
the
throne
was
a
square
cushion
on
the
edges
of
which
were
sown
three
rows
of
pearls
during
the
three
days
the
king
remained
seated
on
this
cushion
when
the
fete
of
mahanawi
was
ended
at
the
hour
of
evening
prayer
i
was
introduced
into
the
middle
of
four
estrades
which
were
about
ten
ghez
both
in
length
and
breadth
the
roof
and
the
walls
were
entirely
formed
of
plates
of
gold
enriched
with
precious
stones
each
of
these
plates
was
as
thick
as
the
blade
of
a
sword
and
was
fastened
with
golden
nails
upon
the
estrade
in
the
front
is
placed
the
throne
of
the
king
and
the
throne
itself
is
of
very
great
size
the
descriptions
given
by
these
travellers
give
us
a
good
idea
of
the
splendours
of
this
great
hindu
capital
in
the
first
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
with
this
in
our
minds
we
return
to
the
history
of
the

seizes
the
throne
i
have
already
stated
that
the
period
following
the
reign
of
deva
raya
ii
is
one
very
difficult
to
fill
up
satisfactorily
from
any
source
it
was
a
period
of
confusion
in
vijayanagar
a
fact
that
is
clearly
brought
out
by
nuniz
in
his
chronicle
is
the
last
date
in
any
known
inscription
containing
mention
of
a
deva
raya
and
hultzsch
allots
this
to
deva
raya
ii
it
may
be
as
already
suggested
that
there
was
a
deva
raya
iii
on
the
throne
between
and
but
this
remains
to
be
proved
two
sons
of
deva
raya
according
to
the
inscriptions
were
named
mallikarjuna
and
virupaksha
respectively
there
are
inscriptions
of
the
former
dated
in
and
and
one
of
the
latter
in
mallikarjuna
appears
to
have
had
two
sons
rajasekhara
of
whom
we
have
inscriptions
in
the
years
and
and
virupaksha
mentioned
in
an
inscription
dated
three
years
earlier
than
the
last
of
rajasekhara
hultzsch
in
the
third
volume
of
the
epigraphia
indica
gives
these
dates
but
in
the
fourth
volume
of
the
same
work
he
notes
that
an
inscription
of
rajasekhara
exists
at
ambur
in
north
arcot
which
is
dated
in
the
year
corresponding
to
i
have
also
been
told
of
an
inscription
on
stone
to
be
seen
at
the
village
of
parnapalle
or
paranapalle
in
the
cuddapah
district
of
which
a
copy
on
is
said
to
be
in
the
possession
of
one
narayana
reddi
of
goddamari
in
the
tadpatri
taluq
of
the
anantapur
district
this
is
reported
to
bear
the
date
saka
and
to
mention
as
sovereign
praudha
deva
raya
of
vijayanagar
rajasekhara
second
inscription
must
have
been
engraved
very
shortly
before
the
final
fall
of
the
old
royal
house
for
the
first
certain
date
of
the
usurper
narasimha
is
amid
this
confusion
of
overlapping
dates
we
turn
for
help
to
nuniz
but
though
his
story
gathered
from
tradition
about
the
year
is
clear
and
consecutive
it
clashes
somewhat
with
the
other
records
according
to
him
deva
raya
ii
had
a
son
pina
raya
who
died
six
months
after
his
attempted
assassination
but
we
have
shown
that
abdur
razzak
conclusively
establishes
that
this
unfortunate
monarch
was
deva
raya
ii
himself
and
that
the
crime
was
committed
before
the
month
of
april
pina
raya
left
a
son
unnamed
who
did
nothing
in
particular
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
verupaca
by
which
name
virupaksha
is
clearly
meant
virupaksha
was
murdered
by
his
eldest
son
who
in
turn
was
slain
by
his
younger
brother
padea
rao
and
this
prince
lost
the
kingdom
to
the
usurper
narasimha
the
period
was
without
doubt
a
troublous
one
and
all
that
can
be
definitely
and
safely
stated
at
present
is
that
for
about
forty
years
prior
to
the
usurpation
of
narasimha
the
kingdom
passed
from
one
hand
to
the
other
in
the
midst
of
much
political
agitation
discontent
and
widespread
antagonism
to
the
representatives
of
the
old
royal
family
several
of
whom
appear
to
have
met
with
violent
deaths
the
usurpation
took
place
at
some
period
between
and
leaving
the
hindu
and
portuguese
records
we
must
turn
to
the
muhammadan
historians
in
order
to
see
what
were
the
political
relations
existing
at
this
time
between
vijayanagar
and
its
hereditary
enemies
to
the
north
firishtah
tells
us
of
no
event
occurring
between
the
year
and
to
disturb
the
peaceful
conditions
then
existing
kulbarga
was
itself
in
too
troubled
a
condition
to
venture
on
further
national
complications
internal
disputes
and
civil
war
raged
in
the
dakhan
and
the
country
was
divided
against
itself
the
trouble
had
begun
which
ended
only
with
the
extinction
of
the
bahmani
monarchy
and
the
establishment
of
five
rival
muhammadan
kingdoms
in
the
place
of
one
died
february
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
humayun
a
prince
of
cruel
and
sanguinary
temper
in
the
following
year
humayun
waged
war
against
the
country
of
the
telugus
and
besieged
devarakonda
which
made
so
stout
a
resistance
that
the
dakhani
armies
were
baffled
and
retired
he
died
on
the
september
to
the
great
relief
of
all
his
subjects
mallikarjuna
appears
to
have
been
then
king
of
vijayanagar
nizam
shah
succeeded
to
the
throne
being
then
only
eight
years
old
but
his
reign
was
of
short
duration
he
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
muhammad
on
july
a
in
the
middle
of
the
year
while
either
rajasekhara
or
virupaksha
was
the
king
of
vijayanagar
mahmud
gawan
muhammad
minister
marched
towards
the
west
and
after
a
fairly
successful
campaign
attacked
goa
then
in
the
possession
of
the
raya
of
vijayanagar
both
by
sea
and
land
he
was
completely
victorious
and
captured
the
place
the
war
was
probably
undertaken
in
revenge
for
a
cruel
massacre
of
muhammadans
which
took
place
in
this
year
according
to
barros
at
this
period
the
coast
trade
was
altogether
in
the
hands
of
the
muhammadans
and
they
used
to
import
large
numbers
of
horses
principally
for
the
use
of
the
great
contending
armies
in
the
dakhan
and
vijayanagar
the
hindu
king
depended
on
this
supply
to
a
large
extent
in
the
moors
at
batecala
bhatkal
having
sold
horses
to
the
moors
of
decan
the
king
of
vijayanagar
ordered
his
vassal
at
onor
honawar
to
kill
all
those
moors
as
far
as
possible
and
frighten
the
rest
away
the
result
of
this
was
a
terrible
massacre
in
which
musulmans
lost
their
lives
the
survivors
fled
and
settled
themselves
at
goa
thus
founding
the
city
that
afterwards
became
the
capital
of
portuguese
india
nuniz
alludes
to
the
loss
of
goa
chaull
and
dabull
by
vijayanagar
in
the
reign
of
verupaca
purchas
states
that
the
massacre
took
place
in
shortly
afterwards
there
arose
to
power
under
the
sultan
muhammad
one
yusuf
adil
khan
a
slave
who
before
long
grew
to
such
power
that
he
overthrew
the
bahmani
dynasty
and
became
himself
the
first
independent
sovereign
of
bijapur
the
first
adil
shah
in
says
the
maasir
the
sultan
took
rajahmundry
and
kondavid
from
the
king
of
orissa
an
inscription
at
kondapalle
a
fine
beautifully
situated
on
a
range
of
hills
gives
the
date
as
or
my
copy
is
imperfect
firishtah
tells
us
that
in
the
year
perkna
roy
of
the
fortress
of
balgoan
at
the
instigation
of
the
prince
of
beejanuggur
marched
to
retake
the
island
of
goa
mahummud
shaw
immediately
upon
intelligence
of
this
irruption
collected
his
forces
and
moved
against
balgoan
a
fortress
of
great
strength
having
round
it
a
deep
wet
ditch
and
near
it
a
pass
the
only
approach
defended
by
redoubts
the
attack
ended
in
the
reduction
of
the
place
when
the
sultan
returned
to
kulbarga
the
maasir
calls
the
chief
of
belgaum
parkatapah
and
major
king
the
translator
of
the
work
gives
a
large
variety
of
spellings
of
the
name
viz
birkanah
parkatabtah
parkatiyah
parkitah
barkabtah
briggs
gives
it
as
birkana
it
has
been
supposed
that
the
real
name
was
vikrama
about
the
year
there
was
a
terrible
famine
in
the
dakhan
and
the
country
of
the
telugus
which
lasted
for
two
years
at
its
close
the
hindu
population
of
kondapalle
revolted
murdered
the
muhammadan
governor
and
invited
aid
from
the
king
of
orissa
this
monarch
accordingly
advanced
and
laid
siege
to
rajahmundry
which
was
then
the
governorship
of
but
on
the
shah
marching
in
person
to
the
relief
of
the
place
the
army
of
orissa
retired
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
which
corresponds
to
march
muhammad
penetrated
to
the
capital
of
orissa
and
used
no
mercy
in
slaughtering
the
inhabitants
and
laying
waste
the
country
of
the
enemy
the
rajah
submitted
and
purchased
his
immunity
from
further
interference
on
the
part
of
the
sultan
by
a
present
of
some
valuable
elephants
firishtah
and
the
maasir
differ
considerably
as
to
what
followed
the
former
states
that
after
his
raid
into
orissa
muhammad
shah
reduced
kondapalle
where
he
destroyed
a
temple
slew
the
brahman
priests
attached
to
it
and
ordered
a
mosque
to
be
erected
on
its
site
he
remained
nearly
three
years
at
rajahmundry
secured
the
telingana
country
expelled
some
refractory
zamindars
and
resolved
on
the
conquest
of
nursing
raya
nursing
says
firishtah
was
a
powerful
raja
possessing
the
country
between
carnatic
and
telingana
extending
along
the
to
matchiliputtum
and
had
added
much
of
the
beejanuggur
territory
to
his
own
by
conquest
with
several
strong
forts
this
was
probably
the
powerful
chief
narasimha
raya
a
relation
of
the
king
of
vijayanagar
who
intrusted
with
the
government
of
large
tracts
was
rising
rapidly
to
independence
under
the
weak
and
feeble
monarch
whom
he
finally
supplanted
the
sultan
went
to
kondapalle
and
there
was
told
that
at
a
distance
of
ten
days
journey
was
the
temple
of
kunchy
the
walls
and
roof
of
which
were
plated
with
gold
ornamented
with
precious
stones
upon
receipt
of
which
intelligence
the
sultan
is
said
to
have
made
a
forced
march
thither
taking
with
him
only
cavalry
and
to
have
sacked
the
place
the
account
given
by
the
maasir
as
to
muhammad
proceedings
at
this
period
is
that
on
going
to
rajahmundry
he
found
there
narasimha
raya
with
cursed
infantry
and
elephants
like
mountains
of
iron
who
in
spite
of
all
his
pomp
and
power
fled
like
a
craven
on
the
approach
of
the
army
of
islam
the
sultan
then
reduced
rajahmundry
which
had
been
held
by
a
hindu
force
not
muhammadan
as
firishtah
declares
in
november
he
marched
from
rajahmundry
to
kondavid
going
towards
the
kingdom
of
vijayanagar
after
reducing
that
fortress
he
proceeded
after
a
while
to
malur
which
belonged
to
narasimha
who
owing
to
his
numerous
army
and
the
extent
of
his
dominions
was
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
of
all
the
rulers
of
telingana
and
vijayanagar
and
who
had
established
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
countries
of
kanara
and
telingana
and
taken
possession
of
most
of
the
districts
of
the
coast
and
interior
of
vijayanagar
while
at
malur
the
sultan
was
informed
that
at
a
distance
of
fifty
farsakhas
from
his
camp
was
a
city
called
ganji
containing
temples
to
which
he
promptly
marched
arriving
before
the
place
on
march
he
sacked
the
city
and
returned
after
this
the
sultan
went
to
masulipatam
which
he
reduced
and
thence
returned
to
kondapalle
this
was
his
last
success
his
murder
of
the
celebrated
mahmud
gawan
his
loyal
and
faithful
servant
in
so
disgusted
the
nobles
that
in
a
short
time
the
kingdom
was
dismembered
the
chiefs
revolted
the
dynasty
was
overthrown
and
five
independent
kingdoms
were
raised
on
its
ruins
muhammad
shah
died
on
march
shortly
before
his
death
he
planned
an
expedition
to
relieve
goa
from
a
vijayanagar
army
which
sewaroy
prince
of
beejanuggur
had
sent
there
firishtah
but
the
sultan
death
put
a
stop
to
this
maasir
we
have
some
further
information
on
the
affairs
of
kulbarga
during
the
reign
of
muhammad
shah
in
the
writings
of
the
russian
traveller
athanasius
nikitin
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
fix
the
exact
date
of
his
sojourn
there
nikitin
was
a
native
of
twer
and
set
out
on
his
wanderings
by
permission
of
the
grand
duke
michael
borissovitch
and
his
own
bishop
gennadius
this
fixes
the
time
of
his
start
so
far
that
it
must
have
taken
place
subsequent
to
and
the
author
of
the
bombay
gazetteer
re
poonah
assigns
the
period
to
as
that
of
nikitin
stay
in
india
nikitin
first
went
to
chaul
and
thence
travelled
by
land
to
junir
here
resides
asat
khan
of
indian
jooneer
a
tributary
of
meliktuchar
he
has
been
fighting
the
kofars
for
twenty
years
being
sometimes
beaten
but
mostly
beating
them
by
meliktuchar
is
probably
meant
the
celebrated
minister
mahmud
gawan
who
in
received
the
title
a
title
which
was
borne
by
the
chief
amongst
the
nobility
at
the
bahmani
court
it
meant
literally
chief
of
the
merchants
the
kofars
are
of
course
the
kaffirs
or
hindus
firishtah
tells
us
of
fighting
having
taken
place
in
between
the
and
the
roles
of
songeer
khalneh
and
rebels
in
kokun
when
the
troops
of
junir
were
under
the
mallik
command
during
the
war
he
captured
goa
as
already
stated
there
were
campaigns
also
against
the
hindus
of
rajahmundry
vinukonda
and
other
places
and
in
one
against
belgaum
which
has
been
already
described
firishtah
tells
us
that
the
daulatabad
and
junir
troops
were
sent
against
the
powerful
hindu
raja
narasimha
on
the
east
coast
as
to
kulbarga
and
his
experiences
there
nikitin
writes
as
follows
the
hindus
are
all
naked
and
they
carry
a
shield
in
one
hand
and
a
sword
in
the
other
some
of
the
servants
are
armed
with
straight
bows
and
arrows
elephants
are
greatly
used
in
battle
large
scythes
are
attached
to
the
trunks
and
tusks
of
the
elephants
and
the
animals
are
clad
in
ornamental
plates
of
steel
they
carry
a
citadel
and
in
the
citadel
twelve
men
in
armour
with
guns
and
arrows
the
land
is
overstocked
with
people
but
those
in
the
country
are
very
miserable
whilst
the
nobles
are
extremely
opulent
and
delight
in
luxury
they
are
wont
to
be
carried
on
their
silver
beds
preceded
by
some
twenty

caparisoned
in

and
followed
by
three
hundred

the

then
gives
details
as
to
the

was
not
successful
for
they
took
only

and
that
at
the
loss
of
many
people
and

the
hindu
sultan
kadam
is
a
very
powerful
prince
he
possesses
a
numerous
army
and
resides
on
a
mountain
at
bichenegher
this
vast
city
is
surrounded
by
three
forts
and
intersected
by
a
river
bordering
on
one
side
on
a
dreadful
jungle
and
on
the
other
on

dale
a
wonderful
place
and
to
any
purpose
convenient
on

side
it
is
quite
inaccessible
a
road
gives
right
through
the
town
and
as
the
mountain
rises
high
with
a
ravine
below
the
town
is
impregnable
the
enemy
besieged
it
for
a
month
and
lost
many
people
owing
to
the
walls
of
water
and
food
plenty
of
water
was
in
sight
but
could
not
be
got
at

indian
stronghold
was
ultimately
taken
by

who
stormed
it
and
fought
day
and
night
to
reduce
it
the
army
that
made
the
siege
with
heavy
guns
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
for
twenty

he
lost
of
his
best
soldiers
on
the
capture
of
the

inhabitants
men

had
their
heads
cut
off
young
and
old
were
made
prisoners
and
sold
the
treasury
however
having
been
found
empty
the
town
was
abandoned
it
is
impossible
to
decide
to
what
this
refers
as
we
have
no

statement
i
observe
however
that
bishop

in

fixes
the
date
of
the
beginning
of
narasimha
reign
as
we
have
yet
to
learn
the
history
of
his
acquiring
the
sovereignty
of
vijayanagar
and
ousting
the
older
dynasty
nothing
has
since
transpired
to
throw
light
on
this
subject
and
the
whole
matter
has
remained
up
to
the
present
in
its
primeval
darkness
but
this
chronicle
of
nuniz
gives
us
the
entire
story
in
most
interesting
form
though
i
can
by
no
means
vouch
for
its
accuracy
it
is
nevertheless
a
resume
of
the
traditional
history
of
the
early
sixteenth
century
written
within
fifty
or
sixty
years
of
the
events
with
which
it
deals
he
tells
us
that
virupaksha
raya
verupacarao
was
a
weak
and
unworthy
sovereign
in
whose
days
large
tracts
of
land
were
lost
to
the
muhammadans
including
goa
chaul
and
dabhol
and
this
statement
at
least
is
historically
accurate
virupaksha
was
despotic
cruel
and
sensuous
caring
for
nothing
but
women
and
to
fuddle
himself
with
drink
so
that
the
whole
country
was
roused
to
indignation
and
rebellion
eventually
he
was
murdered
by
his
eldest
son
who
in
his
turn
was
slain
by
his
brother
padearao
in
whom
the
nation
merely
found
repeated
the
crimes
and
follies
of
his
dead
sire
disgusted
with
this
line
of
sovereigns
the
nobles
rose
deposed
their
king
and
placed
on
the
throne
one
of
their
own
number
narasimha
narsymgua
who
was
in
some
manner
akin
to
him
nuniz
gives
us
a
graphic
account
of
the
last
scenes
how
captain
arrived
at
the
city
gates
and
found
them
undefended
how
he
penetrated
the
palace
and
found
no
one
to
oppose
him
how
he
even
went
as
far
as
the
harem
slaying
some
of
the
women
and
how
at
last
the
craven
king
fled
after
that
narasymgua
was
raised
to
be
king
and
as
he
had
much
power
and
was
beloved
by
the
people
this
kingdom
of
bisnaga
was
called
the
kingdom
of
narsymga
the
problem
of
narasimha
relationship
to
the
old
royal
line
has
never
yet
been
satisfactorily
solved
he
belonged
to
a
family
called
saluva
and
we
constantly
hear
in
the
inscriptions
and
literary
works
of
the
time
of
powerful
lords
who
were
relations
or
descendants
of
his
thus
our
chronicle
has
much
to
say
about
the
saluva
timma
whom
nuniz
calls
salvatinea
who
was
minister
to
king
krishna
deva
raya
an
inscription
of
the
saka
year
which
corresponds
to
speaks
of
narasimha
as
a
great
lord
but
a
great
lord
only
and
so
does
another
of
in
one
of
however
he
is
called
or
the
king
but
although
the
exact
date
of
the
usurpation
and
the
exact
relationship
of
the
usurper
to
the
deposed
king
may
be
difficult
to
ascertain
the
fact
remains
that
narasimha
actually
became
sovereign
about
this
time
that
muhammadan
aggression
was
stayed
by
his
power
and
the
force
of
his
arms
and
that
the
empire
of
vijayanagar
was
under
him
once
more
consolidated
the
account
of
this
period
as
given
by
firishtah
differs
altogether
from
that
of
nuniz
and
gives
rise
to
much
confusion
and
difficulty
and
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
succeeding
sovereigns
narasa
vira
narasimha
krishna
deva
raya
achyuta
and
sadasiva
the
native
inscriptions
themselves
are
totally
at
variance
with
one
another
some
few
points
however
in
the
general
scheme
of
history
of
the
second
dynasty
are
quite
certain
and
these
may
be
shortly
summarised
the
last
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
were
recognised
down
to
about
the
year
narasimha
and
vira
narasimha
ruled
till
the
accession
of
krishna
deva
raya
in
achyuta
succeeded
krishna
in
and
sadasiva
succeeded
achyuta
in
the
latter
was
virtually
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
rama
raya
the
eldest
of
three
brothers
at
first
nominally
his
minister
but
afterwards
independent
the
names
of
the
other
brothers
were
tirumala
and
venkatadri
these
three
men
held
the
government
of
the
kingdom
till
when
the
empire
was
utterly
overthrown
by
a
confederation
of
the
five
muhammadan
kings
of
the
dakhan
already
mentioned
at
the
battle
of
talikota
and
the
magnificent
capital
was
almost
wiped
out
of
existence
with
these
few
facts
to
guide
us
we
turn
to
the
chronicles
of
nuniz
and
firishtah
trying
in
vain
to
obtain
some
points
of
contact
between
them
as
to
the
origin
of
the
second
dynasty
some
clue
which
will
enable
us
to
reconcile
differences
and
arrive
at
the
real
truth
if
we
are
to
be
guided
purely
by
probabilities
it
would
seem
that
the
history
given
by
nuniz
is
likely
to
be
the
more
accurate
of
the
two
his
chronicle
was
written
about
the
year
during
the
reign
of
achyuta
he
lived
at
the
hindu
capital
itself
and
he
gained
his
information
from
hindu
sources
not
long
subsequent
to
the
events
related
firishtah
did
not
write
till
about
was
not
in
any
sense
a
contemporary
recorder
and
did
not
live
amongst
the
hindus
but
at
the
court
of
nizam
shah
at
ahmadnagar
the
lengths
of
reigns
however
as
given
by
nuniz
do
not
tally
with
the
dates
which
we
obtain
from
sources
undoubtedly
reliable
nuniz
has
it
that
virupaksha
son
padearao
the
last
of
the
old
line
fled
from
the
capital
when
the
usurper
narasimha
seized
the
throne
that
the
latter
reigned
years
and
died
leaving
two
sons
these
youths
being
too
young
to
govern
the
dying
king
intrusted
the
kingdom
to
his
minister
narasa
naik
and
both
the
princes
were
murdered
narasa
seized
the
throne
and
held
it
till
his
death
the
length
of
his
reign
is
not
given
his
son
busbalrao
basava
raya
succeeded
and
reigned
six
years
being
succeeded
by
his
brother
the
great
krishna
deva
raya
now
we
know
that
krishna
deva
raya
began
to
reign
in
this
gives
for
the
date
of
the
accession
of
his
predecessor
busbal
if
we
allow
five
years
for
the
reign
of
narasa
a
pure
guess
we
have
his
accession
in
and
the
years
of
narasimha
would
begin
in
but
this
would
apparently
coincide
with
the
reign
of
mallikarjuna
son
of
deva
raya
ii
it
is
perhaps
possible
that
in
after
years
the
usurper
narasimha
reign
was
measured
by
the
hindus
from
the
time
when
he
began
to
attain
power
as
minister
or
as
a
great
noble
and
not
from
the
date
when
he
actually
became
king
but
this
is
pure
conjecture
firishtah
mentions
a
certain
sewaroy
as
being
raya
of
vijayanagar
in
shortly
before
the
death
of
muhammad
shah
bahmani
speaking
of
the
new
sovereign
of
bijapur
the
first
of
the
adil
shahs
in
the
historian
tells
us
that
the
adil
rival
kasim
barid
asked
the
then
minister
of
vijayanagar
for
aid
against
the
rising
power
of
his
enemy
and
that
the
roy
being
a
child
his
minister
heemraaje
sent
an
army
and
seized
the
country
as
far
as
mudkal
and
raichur
this
occurred
in
which
embraces
the
period
from
november
to
november
heemraaje
therefore
is
probably
for
simha
or
narasimha
raja
or
perhaps
for
narasa
otherwise
called
vira
narasimha
firishtah
also
gives
another
account
of
the
same
event
according
to
this
the
adil
shah
hearing
of
dissensions
in
the
hindu
capital
marched
apparently
in
against
raichur
when
heemraaje
having
settled
these
dissensions
advanced
with
the
young
raya
to
that
city
a
battle
ensued
in
which
heemraaje
was
defeated
and
the
young
king
being
mortally
wounded
and
dying
before
he
reached
home
heemraaje
seized
the
government
and
the
country
there
are
furthermore
two
other
passages
in
firishtah
dealing
with
the
overthrow
of
the
old
dynasty
and
the
accession
of
heemraaje
one
runs
as
follows
heemraaje
was
the
first
usurper
he
had
poisoned
the
young
raja
of
beejanuggur
son
of
sheoroy
and
made
his
infant
brother
a
tool
to
his
designs
by
degrees
overthrowing
the
ancient
nobility
and
at
length
establishing
his
own
absolute
authority
over
the
kingdom
the
other
states
the
government
of
beejanuggur
had
remained
in
one
family
in
uninterrupted
succession
for
seven
hundred
years
when
seoroy
dying
was
succeeded
by
his
son
a
minor
who
did
not
live
long
after
him
and
left
the
throne
to
a
younger
brother
he
also
had
not
long
gathered
the
flowers
of
enjoyment
from
the
garden
of
royalty
before
the
cruel
skies
proving
their
inconstancy
the
earth
of
his
existence
with
the
blasting
wind
of
annihilation
being
succeeded
by
an
infant
only
three
months
old
heemraaje
one
of
the
principal
ministers
of
the
family
celebrated
for
great
wisdom
and
experience
became
sole
regent
and
was
cheerfully
obeyed
by
all
the
nobility
and
vassals
of
the
kingdom
for
forty
years
though
on
the
arrival
of
the
young
king
at
manhood
he
had
poisoned
him
and
put
an
infant
of
the
family
on
the
throne
in
order
to
have
a
pretence
for
keeping
the
regency
in
his
own
hands
heemraaje
at
his
death
was
succeeded
in
office
by
his
son
ramraaje
who
having
married
a
daughter
of
the
son
of
seoroy
by
that
alliance
greatly
added
to
his
influence
and
power
he
then
proceeds
to
describe
an
event
that
took
place
in
or
thereabouts
which
will
be
considered
in
its
place
writing
of
the
events
of
the
year
we
find
firishtah
stating
that
the
affairs
of
vijayanagar
were
then
in
confusion
owing
to
the
death
of
heemraaje
who
was
newly
succeeded
by
his
son
ramraaje
and
this
passage
helps
us
definitely
to
the
conclusion
that
his
heemraaje
or
timma
raja
was
the
muhammadan
name
for
the
ruler
of
the
state
during
the
reigns
of
narasimha
narasa
or
vira
narasimha
and
krishna
deva
raya
the
latter
of
whom
died
in
firishtah
seems
to
have
confused
narasa
and
krishna
deva
raya
powerful
minister
saluva
timma
with
narasimha
and
narasa
and
made
all
three
one
person
ramraaje
is
mentioned
as
king
by
firishtah
from
the
accession
of
achyuta
in
down
to
the
year
though
names
and
details
differ
it
will
be
observed
that
there
is
evidently
a
common
basis
of
truth
in
the
accounts
given
by
firishtah
and
nuniz
both
relate
the
deaths
of
two
young
princes
brothers
the
subsequent
murder
of
two
other
heirs
to
the
kingdom
and
the
usurpation
of
the
throne
by
a
minister
with
these
remarks
we
turn
to
the
more
reliable
portion
of
narrative
yusuf
adil
khan
proclaimed
himself
independent
king
of
bijapur
in
shortly
afterwards
his
rival
kasim
barid
who
ultimately
became
sovereign
of
the
territories
of
ahmadabad
in
a
fit
of
jealousy
called
in
the
aid
of
vijayanagar
against
bijapur
promising
for
reward
the
cession
of
mudkal
and
raichur
or
the
country
between
the
two
rivers
narasimha
collected
the
forces
of
the
hindus
crossed
the
tungabhadra
with
a
large
army
and
after
laying
waste
the
country
seized
the
two
cities
mudkal
and
raichur
which
thus
once
more
passed
into
the
possession
of
vijayanagar
shortly
after
this
probably
about
the
year
sultan
yusuf
adil
again
marched
to
recover
the
lost
territory
and
advanced
to
the
krishna
but
falling
ill
he
halted
for
two
months
and
firishtah
gives
us
the
following
account
of
what
occurred
this
has
been
already
alluded
to
but
is
now
given
in
full
in
this
interval
heemraaje
having
settled
his
dissensions
advanced
with
the
young
roy
at
the
head
of
a
great
army
to
roijore
which
struck
terror
into
the
army
of
adil
shaw
for
whose
recovery
earnest
prayers
were
offered
up
by
his
subjects
the
prayers
were
answered
and
the
sultan
recovered
intelligence
arriving
that
heemraaje
had
crossed
the
tummedra
and
was
advancing
by
hasty
marches
eusuff
adil
shaw
ordered
a
general
review
of
his
army
and
advanced
entrenching
his
camp
a
short
distance
from
the
hindus
several
days
passed
inactively
till
on
saturday
in
regib
both
armies
drew
out
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
action
near
five
hundred
of
adil
shaw
troops
being
slain
the
rest
were
disordered
and
fell
back
but
were
rallied
again
by
the
sultan
one
of
the
officers
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
made
his
escape
observed
that
the
enemy
were
busily
employed
in
plunder
and
might
be
attacked
with
advantage
the
sultan
relished
this
advice
and
proceeded
when
heemraaje
not
having
time
to
collect
his
whole
army
drew
out
with
seven
thousand
horse
and
a
considerable
number
of
foot
also
three
hundred
elephants
adil
shaw
charged
his
center
with
such
fury
that
heemraaje
was
unable
to
stand
the
shock
victory
waved
the
royal
standard
and
the
infidels
fled
leaving
two
hundred
elephants
a
thousand
horses
and
sixty
lacs
of
oons
with
many
jewels
and
effects
to
the
conquerors
heemraaje
and
the
young
roy
fled
to
beejanuggur
but
the
latter
died
on
the
road
of
a
wound
he
had
received
by
an
arrow
in
the
action
heemraaje
seized
the
government
of
the
country
but
some
of
the
principal
nobility
opposing
his
usurpation
dissensions
broke
out
which
gave
adil
shaw
relief
from
war
for
some
time
from
that
quarter
the
disputed
territory
between
the
two
rivers
once
more
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
muhammadans
goa
also
remained
in
the
bijapur
sultan
possession
the
last
historical
event
in
the
reign
of
yusuf
adil
shah
of
bijapur
as
narrated
by
firishtah
is
as
follows
in
the
year
the
christians
surprised
the
town
of
goa
and
put
to
death
the
governor
with
many
mussulmauns
upon
intelligence
of
which
adil
shaw
with
three
thousand
chosen
men
dekkanees
and
foreigners
marched
with
such
expedition
that
he
came
upon
the
europeans
unawares
retook
the
fort
and
put
many
to
death
but
some
made
their
escape
in
their
ships
out
to
sea
these
christians
were
the
portuguese
under
albuquerque
and
the
date
of
their
entry
into
goa
was
march
at
this
period
there
was
a
complete
change
in
the
personnel
of
the
chief
actors
on
our
indian
stage
ahmad
nizam
shah
who
had
declared
himself
independent
at
ahmadnagar
in
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
a
boy
of
seven
years
of
age
named
burhan
with
whom
the
traveller
garcia
da
orta
afterwards
became
very
friendly
da
orta
calls
him
my
friend
yusuf
adil
shah
died
in
and
his
successor
on
the
throne
of
bijapur
was
his
son
ismail
krishna
deva
raya
became
raya
of
vijayanagar
in
the
two
monarchs
were
frequently
in
contact
with
one
another
and
in
the
end
according
to
our
chronicles
the
hindu
king
was
completely
victorious
even
firishtah
admits
that
he
dealt
ismail
a
crushing
blow
at
the
great
battle
of
raichur
a
full
description
of
which
is
given
by
nuniz
but
before
dealing
with
the
history
of
the
reign
of
krishna
deva
raya
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
learn
how
it
came
about
that
these
portuguese
christians
who
seized
goa
came
to
be
living
in
india
and
some
of
them
even
resident
at
the
hindu
capital
the
portuguese
arrive
in
india
king
john
of
portugal
had
acquired
some
knowledge
of
india
in
and
after
causing
inquiries
to
be
made
as
to
the
possibility
of
discovering
the
rich
and
interesting
country
in
the
far
east
had
begun
to
fit
out
three
ships
but
he
died
before
they
were
ready
his
successor
dom
manuel
took
up
the
matter
warmly
and
sent
these
ships
out
under
vasco
da
gama
and
his
brother
paulo
with
orders
to
try
and
double
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
full
account
of
the
extraordinary
voyage
made
by
them
is
given
in
the
three
voyages
of
vasco
da

translated
and
published
in
the
hakluyt
edition

a
translation
of
certain
portions
of
correa

india
da
gama
sailed
on
july
and
arrived
close
to
calicut
on
august
the
samuri
or
king
of
calicut
was
at
first
friendly
but
there
were
misunderstandings
on
the
part
of
the
portuguese
and
they
made
little
or
no
progress
either
in
trade
or
in
establishing
amicable
relations
with
the
hindus
da
gama
returned
shortly
after
to
portugal
early
in
cabral
took
out
another
and
larger
fleet
and
arrived
at
calicut
on
september
he
at
once
quarrelled
with
the
samuri
and
instead
of
peaceful
commerce
we
read
of
attacks
and
conducted
in
such
sort
by
the
portuguese
as
irretrievably
to
alienate
the
natives
of
the
country
a
few
europeans
however
settled
in
that
tract
and
amongst
them
duarte
barbosa
the
celebrated
chronicler
of
the
time
da
gama
returned
to
india
in
proclaiming
the
king
of
portugal
lord
of
the
seas
and
wantonly
destroying
with
all
hands
a
large
vessel
having
several
hundred
people
on
board
near
the
indian
coast
he
reached
calicut
on
october
and
immediately
bombarded
the
city
seizing
the
inoffensive
native
fishermen
in
the
port
eight
hundred
of
whom
he
massacred
in
cold
blood
under
circumstances
of
brutal
atrocity
in
he
again
left
for
europe
after
establishing
a
factory
at
cochin
in
consequence
of
his
violence
a
war
ensued
between
cochin
and
calicut
in
lopo
soares
came
out
with
a
fleet
of
fourteen
caravels
and
proclaimed
a
blockade
of
the
port
of
cochin
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
rajah
of
that
place
had
always
shown
great
kindness
and
hospitality
to
the
portuguese
the
next
year
almeida
was
appointed
viceroy
of
the
king
of
portugal
on
the
indian
coast
and
took
out
with
him
a
large
fleet
and
soldiers
after
some
preliminary
fighting
at
honawar
almeida
began
for
the
first
time
to
perceive
that
the
true
interests
of
the
portuguese
lay
in
peaceful
commerce
and
not
in
sanguinary
and
costly
attacks
on
the
natives
and
he
also
learned
from
an
influential
native
of
the
existence
of
the
great
kingdom
of
vijayanagar
and
the
power
of
its
king
narasimha
or
narasa
at
cannanore
the
viceroy
son
lourenco
in
received
further
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
country
from
the
italian
traveller
varthema
and
in
consequence
of
this
almeida
asked
king
narasa
to
allow
him
to
erect
a
fortress
at
bhatkal
but
no
answer
was
returned
varthema
has
left
behind
him
a
valuable
account
of
his
experiences
at
this
period
he
speaks
of
goa
as
being
then
under
the
savain
which
is
this
writer
form
of
expressing
the
ruler
known
to
the
portuguese
as
the
sabayo
who
was
the
governor
of
the
place
under
the
adil
shah
of
bijapur
the
sabayo
was
then
at
war
with
narasimha
of
vijayanagar
he
describes
vijayanagar
as
a
great
city
very
large
and
strongly
walled
it
is
situated
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
is
seven
miles
in
circumference
it
has
a
triple
circlet
of
walls
it
was
very
wealthy
and
well
supplied
situated
on
a
beautiful
site
and
enjoying
an
excellent
climate
the
king
keeps
up
constantly
horsemen
and
elephants
the
elephants
each
carry
six
men
and
have
long
swords
fastened
to
their
trunks
in
battle
a
description
which
agrees
with
that
of
nikitin
and
paes
the
common
people
go
quite
naked
with
the
exception
of
a
piece
of
cloth
about
their
middle
the
king
wears
a
cap
of
gold
brocade
two
spans
long
his
horse
is
worth
more
than
some
of
our
cities
on
account
of
the
ornaments
which
it
wears
calicut
he
says
was
ruined
in
consequence
of
its
wars
with
the
portuguese
varthema
saw
portuguese
traders
massacred
at
calicut
by
the
moors
and
in
consequence
of
the
dangerous
state
of
things
existing
there
he
left
the
city
and
pursued
his
journey
southwards
round
the
coast
here
we
may
leave
him
in
march
a
portuguese
fleet
destroyed
with
immense
loss
of
life
a
large
flotilla
of
small
boats
belonging
to
the
rajah
of
calicut
in
the
next
year
an
outrage
committed
by
the
portuguese
led
to
a
siege
of
their
factory
at
cannanore
but
the
timely
arrival
of
tristan
da
cunha
with
a
new
fleet
from
home
relieved
the
beleaguered
garrison
at
the
end
of
almeida
and
da

joined
forces
and
again
attacked
calicut
with
some
measure
of
success
afonso
was
now
in
the
persian

fighting
with
all
the
moors
he
could
meet
at
the

of
he
became

diogo

receiving
the
governorship
under

of

east
of
cape
comorin
from
the
accession
of
krishna
deva

to
the
throne
of
vijayanagar
in
we
once
more
enter
a
period
when
the
history
of
the
country
becomes
less
confused
and
we
are
able
to
trace
the
sequence
of
events
without
serious
difficulty
this
was
the
period
of
greatest
successes
when
its
armies
were
everywhere
victorious
and
the
city
was
most
prosperous
chapter

wars
of
the
qutb
shah
of

in

an
inscription
in
the
pampapati
temple
at
hampe
states
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
coronation
of
krishna
deva
raya
the
king
built
a
hall
of
assembly
and
a
gopura
or
tower
there
and
the
date
is
given
as
the
of
the
first
half
of
the
lunar
month
magha
in
the
expired
saka
year
the
year
of
the
cycle
being
sukla
it
so
happens
that
the
cyclic
year
sukla
does
not
correspond
to
saka
expired
but
to
saka
expired
and
this
unfortunate
error
leaves
us
in
doubt
as
to
the
true
date
of
that
important
event
if
we
conceive
the
mistake
as
having
occurred
not
in
the
name
of
the
year
which
was
perhaps
in
constant
daily
use
but
in
the
number
of
the
saka
year
then
the
date
corresponds
to
or
january
but
if
the
number
of
the
saka
year
was
correct
and
the
name
wrong
then
the
day
must
have
been
february
the
cyclic
year
being
properly
vibhava
even
then
it
is
not
certain
whether
this
festival
took
place
on
the
coronation
day
itself
or
on
an
anniversary
of
that
event
and
a
considerable
interval
may
have
elapsed
between
the
king
accession
and
coronation
probably
we
shall
not
be
wrong
if
we
consider
that
the
new
king
succeeded
to
the
throne
in
krishna
raya
seems
to
have
possessed
a
very
striking
personality
to
judge
from
the
glowing
description
given
us
by
paes
who
saw
him
about
the
year
the
account
given
by
him
is
all
the
more
interesting
and
valuable
because
without
it
the
world
would
have
remained
justly
in
doubt
as
to
whether
this
king
really
reigned
at
all
in
the
usual
acceptation
of
the
word
whether
he
was
not
a
mere
puppet
entirely
in
the
hands
of
his
minister
perhaps
even
an
actual
prisoner
for
firishtah
never
mentions
him
by
name
and
the
inscriptions
which
relate
his
conquests
prove
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
they
took
place
during
a
reign
which
for
all
we
know
might
have
been
a
reign
only
in
name
the
real
power
being
in
the
hands
of
the
nobles
but
with
the
description
of
paes
in
our
hands
there
can
be
no
longer
a
shadow
of
doubt
krishna
deva
was
not
only
monarch
de
jure
but
was
in
very
practical
fact
an
absolute
sovereign
of
extensive
power
and
strong
personal
influence
he
was
the
real
ruler
he
was
physically
strong
in
his
best
days
and
kept
his
strength
up
to
the
highest
pitch
by
hard
bodily
exercise
he
rose
early
and
developed
all
his
muscles
by
the
use
of
indian
clubs
and
the
use
of
the
sword
he
was
a
fine
rider
and
was
blessed
with
a
noble
presence
which
favourably
impressed
all
who
came
in
contact
with
him
he
commanded
his
immense
armies
in
person
was
able
brave
and
statesmanlike
and
was
withal
a
man
of
much
gentleness
and
generosity
of
character
he
was
beloved
by
all
and
respected
by
all
paes
writes
of
him
that
he
was
gallant
and
perfect
in
all
things
the
only
blot
on
his
scutcheon
is
that
after
his
great
success
over
the
muhammadan
king
he
grew
to
be
haughty
and
insolent
in
his
demands
no
monarch
such
as
the
adil
shah
could
brook
for
a
moment
such
a
humiliation
as
was
implied
by
a
peace
the
condition
of
which
was
that
he
should
kiss
his
triumphant
enemy
foot
and
it
was
beyond
all
doubt
this
and
similar
contemptuous
arrogance
on
the
part
of
successive
hindu
rulers
that
finally
led
forty
years
later
to
the
downfall
of
the
hindu
empire
all
southern
india
was
under
krishna
deva
sway
and
several
chiefs
were
his
vassals
these
were
according
to
nuniz
the
chief
of
seringapatam
and
those
of
bankapur
garsopa
calicut
bhatkal
and
barkur
the
portuguese
treated
these
lesser
chiefs
as
if
they
were
kings
called
them
so
and
sent
embassies
to
them
no
doubt
much
to
their
satisfaction
the
present
head
of
the
brahmanical
establishment
at
the
hampe
temple
informed
me
that
krishna
deva
raya
celebrated
his
accession
by
erecting
the
great
tower
at
the
entrance
of
the
temple
and
the
next
largest
tower
shortly
afterwards
nuniz
tells
us
that
immediately
on
attaining
power
the
king
making
saluva
timma
his
minister
sent
his
nephew
the
son
of
the
last
sovereign
and
his
own
three
brothers
to
the
fortress
of
chandragiri
miles
to
the
for
his
greater
security
and
himself
remained
for
some
time
at
the
capital
this
accords
well
with
the
writings
of
the
other
portuguese
who
relate
that
at
least
on
two
occasions
when
missions
were
sent
from
calicut
and
goa
those
of
fr
luis
and
chanoca
the
envoys
saw
the
king
in
person
at
vijayanagar
at
the
beginning
of
krishna
reign
almeida
as
stated
above
was
viceroy
of
the
portuguese
settlements
on
the
coast
but
at
the
end
of
the
year
albuquerque
succeeded
him
under
the
title
of
governor
the
latter
suffered
a
severe
reverse
at
calicut
and
from
thence
despatched
fr
luis
of
the
order
of
francis
as
ambassador
to
vijayanagar
begging
the
raya
to
come
by
land
and
reduce
the
samuri
of
calicut
promising
himself
to
assault
simultaneously
by
sea
the
governor
declared
that
he
had
orders
from
his
master
the
king
of
portugal
to
war
against
the
moors
but
not
against
the
hindus
that
calicut
had
been
destroyed
by
the
governor
and
its
king
had
fled
into
the
interior
that
he
the
governor
offered
his
fleet
to
assist
the
king
of
vijayanagar
in
his
conquest
of
the
place
that
as
soon
as
calicut
was
captured
the
moors
would
be
driven
therefrom
and
that
afterwards
the
portuguese
would
assist
the
king
of
vijayanagar
against
his
enemies
the
moors
of
the
dakhan
he
promised
in
future
to
supply
vijayanagar
alone
with
arab
and
persian
horses
and
not
to
send
any
to
bijapur
no
answer
was
returned
albuquerque
next
attacked
goa
then
under
the
adil
shah
and
captured
the
place
making
his
triumphal
entry
into
it
on
march
immediately
afterwards
he
despatched
gaspar
chanoca
on
a
mission
to
vijayanagar
renewing
almeida
request
for
a
fort
at
bhatkal
for
the
protection
of
portuguese
trade
barros
states
that
chanoca
reported
that
though
he
was
received
solemnly
krishna
deva
raya
only
made
a
general
answer
in
courteous
terms
and
did
not
specifically
grant
the
governor
request
the
reason
being
that
the
king
had
then
made
peace
with
the
adil
shah
presumably
this
peace
was
made
in
order
to
enable
the
adil
shah
to
retake
goa
upon
this
a
message
was
sent
from
vijayanagar
to
albuquerque
congratulating
the
portuguese
on
their
conquest
of
goa
and
promising
to
aid
them
against
the
adil
shah
this
aid
however
does
not
appear
to
have
been
given
the
muhammadan
troops
attacked
goa
in
may
and
after
a
severe
struggle
were
successful
albuquerque
evacuating
the
place
after
decapitating
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
principal
muhammadans
there
and
slaughtering
their
wives
and
children
in
november
of
the
same
year
ismail
adil
attention
being
called
off
by
internal
dissension
at
bijapur
albuquerque
attacked
rasul
khan
ismail
deputy
at
goa
and
the
eight
thousand
men
under
his
command
defeated
them
retook
the
place
on
december
and
slew
six
thousand
men
women
and
children
of
the
muhammadans
firishtah
states
that
the
young
adil
shah
minister
kummal
khan
after
this
made
peace
with
the
europeans
and
left
them
securely
established
at
goa
this
however
is
not
quite
correct
for
rasul
khan
made
a
desperate
attempt
in
to
retake
the
place
but
failed
after
severe
fighting
as
soon
as
the
news
reached
vijayanagar
of
albuquerque
success
in
december
krishna
deva
raya
sent
ambassadors
to
goa
and
by
them
fr
luis
sent
letters
to
albuquerque
detailing
the
result
of
his
mission
he
had
been
well
received
by
all
except
the
king
but
the
king
had
nevertheless
granted
permission
for
the
portuguese
to
build
a
fort
at
bhatkal
poor
fr
luis
never
returned
from
his
embassy
history
is
silent
as
to
what
happened
or
what
led
to
the
tragedy
but
he
was
one
day
murdered
in
the
city
of
vijayanagar
his
despatch
is
interesting
as
containing
information
regarding
vijayanagar
and
the
sultan
of
bijapur
part
of
which
is
certainly
accurate
while
part
tells
us
of
krishna
deva
raya
proceedings
at
this
period
regarding
which
we
know
nothing
from
any
other
source
fr
luis
wrote
to
albuquerque
that
the
adil
shah
had
attacked
bijapur
and
had
taken
it
after
a
siege
of
two
months
while
four
lords
had
risen
against
him
since
the
latter
had
carried
off
the
king
of
decan
as
a
prisoner
this
king
was
the
bahmani
king
while
the
adil
shah
and
the
four
lords
were
the
revolting
muhammadan
princes
he
added
that
the
people
of
belgaum
had
revolted
from
the
adil
shah
and
submitted
to
the
hindu
sovereign
as
to
vijayanagar
he
said
that
the
king
was
getting
ready
a
small
expedition
of
seven
thousand
men
to
send
against
one
of
his
vassals
who
had
risen
up
in
rebellion
and
seized
the
city
of
pergunda
pennakonda
saying
that
it
belonged
to
himself
by
right
and
that
after
he
had
taken
the
rebel
the
king
would
proceed
to
certain
places
on
the
fr
luis
professed
himself
unable
to
understand
the
drift
of
this
latter
design
but
warned
albuquerque
to
be
careful
he
advised
him
to
keep
up
friendly
communications
with
the
king
and
by
no
means
to
place
any
reliance
on
the
man
on
whom
of
all
others
the
portuguese
had
pinned
their
faith
one
timoja
a
hindu
who
had
befriended
the
the
priest
declared
that
timoja
was
a
traitor
to
them
and
had
in
conjunction
with
the
king
of
garsopa
promised
krishna
deva
raya
that
he
would
deliver
goa
to
him
before
the
portuguese
could
fortify
their
possessions
therein
if
he
should
send
a
fully
equipped
army
to
seize
the
place
after
albuquerque
second
capture
of
goa
the
chief
of
bankapur
also
sent
messages
of
congratulation
to
the
portuguese
and
asked
for
permission
to
import
three
hundred
horses
a
year
the
request
was
granted
as
the
place
was
on
the
road
to
vijayanagar
and
it
was
important
that
its
chief
should
be
on
friendly
terms
with
the
europeans
moreover
bankapur
contained
a
number
of
superior
saddlers
krishna
deva
anxiety
was
to
secure
horses
he
must
have
thought
little
of
this
foreign
settlement
on
the
coast
as
a
political
power
but
what
he
wanted
was
horses
and
again
horses
for
his
perpetual
wars
against
the
adil
shah
and
albuquerque
after
toying
a
little
with
the
muhammadan
gratified
the
hindu
by
sending
him
a
message
in
which
he
declared
that
he
would
prefer
to
send
cavalry
mounts
to
him
rather
than
to
supply
them
to
the
sultan
of
bijapur
about
the
year
krishna
deva
raya
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
times
to
invade
the
sultan
dominions
attacked
the
fortress
of
raichur
which
at
last
was
given
up
to
him
by
the
garrison
ismail
adil
being
too
much
employed
in
attending
to
the
internal
affairs
of
his
government
to
afford
it
timely
relief
so
says
firishtah
this
event
is
not
noticed
by
nuniz
who
writes
as
if
the
raya
first
campaign
against
the
adil
shah
took
place
in
when
he
advanced
to
attack
raichur
it
being
then
in
the
shah
possession
and
here
we
see
a
difference
between
the
story
of
nuniz
and
the
story
of
firishtah
for
the
latter
writing
of
the
same
event
the
campaign
of
states
that
ismail
adil
shaw
made
preparations
for
marching
to
recover
mudkal
and
roijore
from
the
roy
of
beejanuggar
he
having
taken
these
cities
about
as
narrated
which
account
is
correct
i
can
not
say
it
appears
that
in
krishna
deva
offered
albuquerque
pound
sterling
for
the
exclusive
right
to
trade
in
horses
but
the
portuguese
governor
with
a
keen
eye
to
business
refused
a
little
later
the
hindu
king
renewed
his
proposal
declaring
his
intention
of
making
war
against
the
adil
shah
and
the
adil
shah
hearing
of
this
message
himself
sent
an
embassy
to
goa
albuquerque
was
now
placed
in
a
position
of
some
political
importance
and
he
wrote
first
to
vijayanagar
saying
that
he
would
give
the
raya
the
refusal
of
all
his
horses
if
he
would
pay
him
cruzados
per
annum
for
the
supply
and
send
his
own
servants
to
goa
to
fetch
away
the
animals
and
also
that
he
would
aid
the
king
in
his
war
if
he
was
paid
the
expense
of
the
troops
and
he
wrote
afterwards
to
bijapur
promising
the
sultan
the
refusal
of
all
horses
that
came
to
goa
if
he
would
surrender
to
the
king
of
portugal
a
certain
portion
of
the
mainland
opposite
the
island
before
this
matter
was
settled
however
albuquerque
died
we
learn
from
this
narrative
the
krishna
deva
raya
was
meditating
a
grand
attack
on
the
muhammadans
at
least
five
years
before
his
advance
to
raichur
a
year
even
before
his
expedition
against
udayagiri
and
the
fortresses
on
the
east
the
story
of
which
campaign
is
given
in
our
chronicle
we
have
an
account
of
what
vijayanagar
was
like
in
in
the
narrative
of
duarte
barbosa
a
cousin
of
magellan
who
visited
the
city
during
that
period
speaking
of
the
kingdom
of
narsinga
by
which
name
the
vijayanagar
territories
were
always
known
to
the
portuguese
barbosa
writes
it
is
very
rich
and
well
supplied
with
provisions
and
is
very
full
of
cities
and
large
townships
he
describes
the
large
trade
of
the
seaport
of
bhatkal
on
its
western
coast
the
exports
from
which
consisted
of
iron
spices
drugs
myrabolans
and
the
imports
of
horses
and
pearls
but
as
regards
he
last
two
items
he
says
they
now
go
to
goa
on
account
of
the
portuguese
the
governor
of
bhatkal
was
a
nephew
of
king
krishna
deva
he
lives
in
great
state
and
calls
himself
king
but
is
in
obedience
to
the
king
his
uncle
leaving
the
and
going
inland
barbosa
passed
upwards
through
the
ghats
leagues
from
these
mountains
there
is
a
very
large
city
which
is
called
bijanaguer
very
populous
and
surrounded
on
one
side
by
a
very
good
wall
and
on
another
by
a
river
and
on
the
other
by
a
mountain
this
city
is
on
level
ground
the
king
of
narsinga
always
resides
in
it
he
is
a
gentile
and
is
called
raheni
he
has
in
this
place
very
large
and
handsome
palaces
with
numerous
courts
there
are
also
in
this
city
many
other
palaces
of
great
lords
who
live
there
and
all
the
other
houses
of
the
place
are
covered
with
thatch
and
the
streets
and
squares
are
very
wide
they
are
constantly
filled
with
an
innumerable
crowd
of
all
nations
and
creeds
there
is
an
infinite
trade
in
this
city
in
this
city
there
are
many
jewels
which
are
brought
from
pegu
and
celani
ceylon
and
in
the
country
itself
many
diamonds
are
found
because
there
is
a
mine
of
them
in
the
kingdom
of
narsinga
and
another
in
the
kingdom
of
decani
there
are
also
many
pearls
and
to
be
found
there
which
are
brought
from
ormuz
and
cael
also
scarlet
cloth
and
coral
the
king
constantly
resides
in
the
palaces
and
very
seldom
goes
out
of
them
all
the
attendance
on
the
king
is
done
by
women
who
wait
upon
him
within
doors
and
amongst
them
are
all
the
employments
of
the
household
and
all
these
women
live
and
find
room
within
these
palaces
which
contain
apartments
for
all
this
king
has
a
house
in
which
he
meets
with
the
governors
and
his
officers
in
council
upon
the
affairs
of
the
realm
they
come
in
very
rich
litters
on
men
shoulders
many
litters
and
many
horsemen
always
stand
at
the
door
of
this
palace
and
the
king
keeps
at
all
times
nine
hundred
elephants
and
more
than
twenty
thousand
horses
all
which
elephants
and
horses
are
bought
with
his
own
money
this
king
has
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
men
both
horse
and
foot
to
whom
he
gives
pay
when
the
king
dies
four
or
five
hundred
women
burn
themselves
with
him
the
king
of
narsinga
is
frequently
at
war
with
the
king
of
dacani
who
has
taken
from
him
much
of
his
land
and
with
another
gentile
king
of
the
country
of
otira
apparently
orissa
which
is
the
country
in
the
interior
barbosa
mentions
that
the
lord
of
goa
before
the
portuguese
attack
on
the
place
was
sabaym
delcani
meaning
the
king
of
the
dakhan
and
he
alludes
to
its
first
capture
by
albuquerque
on
february
and
the
second
on
november
of
the
same
year
we
learn
from
other
sources
that
about
this
time
krishna
deva
raya
was
engaged
with
a
refractory
vassal
in
the
maisur
country
the
ganga
rajah
of
ummatur
and
was
completely
successful
he
captured
the
strong
fortress
of
sivasamudra
and
the
fortress
of
srirangapattana
or
seringapatam
reducing
the
whole
country
to
obedience
in
he
marched
against
udayagiri
in
the
present
district
of
nellore
an
exceedingly
strong
then
under
the
king
of
orissa
and
after
the
successful
termination
of
the
war
he
brought
with
him
from
a
temple
on
the
hill
a
statue
of
the
god
krishna
which
he
set
up
at
vijayanagar
and
endowed
with
a
grant
of
lands
this
is
commemorated
by
a
long
inscription
still
in
existence
at
the
capital
it
was
then
that
the
great
temple
of
krishnasvami
was
built
which
though
now
in
ruins
is
still
one
of
the
most
interesting
objects
in
the
city
this
is
also
attested
by
a
long
inscription
on
stone
still
in
its
place
the
king
further
built
the
temple
of
hazara
ramasvami
near
or
in
his
palace
enclosure
at
the
same
time
nuniz
relates
that
at
udayagiri
krishna
raya
captured
an
aunt
of
the
king
of
orissa
and
took
her
prisoner
to
vijayanagar
he
next
proceeded
against
kondavid
another
very
strong
also
in
possession
of
the
king
of
orissa
where
he
met
and
defeated
the
king
in
person
in
a
pitched
battle
and
captured
the
citadel
after
a
two
siege
he
left
saluva
timma
here
as
a
governor
of
the
conquered
provinces
and
went
in
pursuit
of
his
enemy
northwards
nuniz
says
that
saluva
timma
appointed
his
own
brother
captain
of
kondavid
but
an
inscription
at
that
place
gives
us
the
name
of
this
man
as
nadendla
gopamantri
and
calls
him
a
nephew
of
timma
kondavid
seems
to
have
been
under
the
kings
of
orissa
since
its
capture
by
krishna
deva
took
place
in
to
confirm
our
account
of
the
king
northward
journey
i
find
that
there
is
at
the
town
of
meduru
miles
of
bezvada
on
the
krishna
an
inscription
which
states
that
in
a
battle
took
place
there
between
krishna
deva
and
some
enemy
whose
name
is
obliterated
in
which
the
former
was
victorious
the
king
advanced
to
kondapalle
took
the
place
after
a
three
siege
and
captured
therein
a
wife
and
son
of
the
king
of
orissa
the
unhappy
fate
of
the
latter
is
told
in
the
chronicle
thence
he
marched
to
rajahmundry
and
halted
six
months
peace
was
made
shortly
after
and
krishna
deva
married
a
daughter
of
the
orissan
king
after
this
marriage
king
krishna
made
an
expedition
against
a
place
in
the
east
which
nuniz
calls
catuir
on
the
coromandel
side
and
took
it
i
have
been
unable
to
locate
this
place
by
these
conquests
the
whole
of
his
eastern
dominions
were
brought
into
entire
subjection
to
the
sovereign
nuniz
writes
as
though
the
attack
on
raichur
immediately
followed
the
campaign
against
udayagiri
kondavid
and
catuir
but
according
to
the
evidence
afforded
by
inscriptions
these
expeditions
were
at
an
end
in
and
the
battle
of
raichur
did
not
take
place
for
at
least
five
years
later
a
long
account
of
wars
in
the
dakhan
country
between
sultan
quli
qutb
shah
of
golkonda
and
his
neighbours
both
mussulman
and
hindu
is
given
in
the
third
volume
of
colonel
firishtah
translated
from
a
muhammadan
historian
not
firishtah
himself
and
as
this
certainly
covers
the
period
of
at
least
a
portion
of
krishna
deva
reign
it
is
well
to
give
a
summary
of
it
i
can
not
however
as
yet
determine
the
exact
dates
referred
to
and
the
story
differs
from
that
acquired
from
hindu
and
portuguese
accounts
the
dates
of
which
are
confirmed
by
epigraphical
records
sultan
quli
proclaimed
himself
an
independent
sovereign
in
the
historian
referred
to
states
that
shortly
after
this
quli
attacked
and
took
razukonda
and
devarakonda
fortresses
respectively
and
of
hyderabad
in
telingana
after
the
second
of
these
places
had
fallen
krishna
raya
of
vijayanagar
marched
against
the
sultan
with
an
immense
army
and
invaded
his
dominions
this
must
i
think
refer
to
about
the
year
the
hindu
army
encamped
at
pangul
in
the
angle
of
the
krishna
river
almost
due
east
of
raichur
and
here
a
battle
took
place
in
which
the
qutb
shah
was
victorious
the
place
was
then
besieged
it
capitulated
and
the
muhammadans
proceeded
to
ghanpura
twenty
miles
to
the
north
this
fort
was
captured
after
heavy
loss
and
the
sultan
led
his
army
to
kovilkonda
twenty
miles
to
the
on
the
borders
of
the
country
of
bidar
the
territory
of
imad
shah
this
place
also
fell
a
war
with
the
imad
shah
followed
in
which
sultan
quli
was
again
victorious
shortly
afterwards
there
were
disturbances
on
the
east
of
the
golkonda
territories
sitapati
rajah
of
kambampeta
on
the
muniyer
river
who
possessed
extensive
territories
including
warangal
and
bellamkonda
a
fortress
south
of
the
krishna
rose
against
the
muhammadans
and
the
sultan
marched
against
bellamkonda
which
after
a
long
siege
he
captured
sitapati
then
fought
a
pitched
battle
was
defeated
and
fled
quli
returning
to
golkonda
the
rajah
then
stirred
up
a
number
of
neighbouring
chiefs
and
assembled
large
forces
at
kambampeta
hearing
of
this
the
golkonda
forces
marched
to
attack
them
and
met
with
complete
success
sitapati
flying
to
the
protection
of
ramchunder
dew
the
son
of
gujputty
who
held
his
court
at
condapilly
and
was
king
of
orissa
the
sultan
advanced
and
attacked
kambampeta
where
after
his
capture
of
the
place
he
slew
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
city
seizing
the
females
of
sitapati
household
for
his
own
seraglio
meanwhile
an
immense
hindu
host
from
all
the
countries
about
under
command
of
the
king
of
orissa
prepared
to
do
battle
for
their
country
and
a
decisive
action
took
place
near
the
river
at
palinchinur
in
which
the
hindus
were
completely
defeated
quli
then
seized
kondapalle
ellore
and
rajahmundry
and
a
treaty
was
made
between
him
and
orissa
fixing
the
godavari
river
as
the
eastern
boundary
of
golkonda
by
this
the
sultan
added
the
districts
of
ellore
and
bezvada
to
his
own
dominions
krishna
raya
then
advanced
to
the
rescue
and
the
sultan
marched
to
kondavid
he
invested
the
place
but
was
forced
to
retreat
owing
to
attacks
made
on
him
from
bellamkonda
and
vinukonda
the
first
of
which
fortresses
he
succeeded
in
reducing
after
heavy
loss
after
this
he
retired
towards
kondapalle
krishna
raya
now
arrived
and
attacked
the
muhammadan
garrison
in
bellamkonda
upon
which
the
sultan
and
suddenly
appeared
in
rear
of
the
hindu
army
in
the
battle
which
ensued
he
was
victorious
and
the
siege
was
raised
after
which
he
returned
to
kondavid
and
took
it
on
learning
of
the
fall
of
kondavid
krishna
raya
detached
his
general
and
seeva
ray
with
foot
and
horse
to
march
against
the
muhammadans
the
sultan
retreated
and
encamped
on
the
banks
of
the
krishna
leaving
kondavid
to
the
hindus
after
settling
the
place
the
vijayanagar
forces
proceeded
in
pursuit
of
the
sultan
were
attacked
by
him
defeated
and
retired
to
kondavid
which
was
a
second
time
invested
by
the
army
of
golkonda
the
hindus
then
submitted
and
agreed
to
become
tributary
on
his
return
towards
his
capital
the
sultan
learned
that
ismail
adil
shah
of
bijapur
was
besieging
kovilkonda
at
the
instance
of
the
raja
of
beejanuggur
he
marched
against
him
and
a
series
of
actions
ensued
the
campaign
lasting
eleven
months
at
the
end
of
which
ismail
died
of
a
fever
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son

was
wounded
severely
by
a
sabre
in
the
face
and
disfigured
for
life
i
have
given
the
whole
of
this
story
in
this
place
because
it
runs
as
a
consecutive
series
of
events
in
the
original
muhammadan
account
but
it
really
covers
a
period
of
at
least
years
for
the
narrative
begins
shortly
after
the
beginning
of
quli
reign
and
ends
with
ismail
death
we
are
left
therefore
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
the
exact
years
referred
to
but
there
are
some
points
of
agreement
between
our
authorities
it
is
certain
that
krishna
deva
took
kondavid
in
and
fought
battles
in
the
neighbourhood
in
the
following
year
and
though
nuniz
asserts
that
he
took
kondavid
from
the
king
of
orissa
he
also
alludes
to
the
presence
of
armed
bodies
of
muhammadans
in
that
tract
opposed
to
the
hindus
with
these
remarks
we
return
to
vijayanagar
history
from
to
we
have
no
records
from
hindu
sources
to
guide
us
as
to
events
at
the
capital
the
portuguese
traded
on
the
coast
and
there
were
some
fights
with
the
neighbouring
hindu
chiefs
but
they
seem
to
have
affected
the
capital
but
little
the
foreigners
were
generally
on
friendly
terms
with
the
suzerain
at
vijayanagar
and
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
were
welcome
to
consolidate
their
commerce
since
he
benefited
largely
by
the
import
of
horses
and
other
requisites
the
rest
of
his
dominions
were
tranquil
and
the
inhabitants
obedient
to
his
rule
the
whole
country
was
divided
out
so
nuniz
tells
us
and
his
account
is
confirmed
by
other
evidence
into
governorships
each
chief
was
allowed
entire
independence
in
the
territory
allotted
to
him
so
long
as
he
maintained
the
quota
of
horse
foot
and
elephants
the
maintenance
of
which
was
the
price
of
his
possession
in
perfect
readiness
for
immediate
action
and
paid
his
annual
tribute
to
the
sovereign
failing
these
he
was
liable
to
instant
ejection
as
the
king
was
lord
of
all
and
the
nobles
held
only
by
his
goodwill
but
during
this
period
of
peace
the
king
made
extensive
preparations
for
a
grand
attack
on
the
territory
between
the
rivers
the
land
which
for
nearly
two
centuries
had
been
the
subject
of
dispute
between
his
predecessors
and
their
northern
neighbours
his
objective
was
the
city
of
raichur
then
under
the
muhammadans
and
when
all
was
ready
he
marched
to
the
attack
with
an
immense
force
this
event
requires

chapter

i
shall
ask
my
readers
to
turn
for
an
account
of
the
great
battle
and
siege
of
raichur
to
the
narrative
of
nuniz
whose
description
is
so
full
and
so
vivid
that
it
may
well
be
allowed
to
stand
by
itself
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
add
a
few
notes
the
following
is
a
short
summary
of
the
story
krishna
deva
raya
having
determine
to
attack
the
adil
shah
and
once
for
all
to
capture
the
disputed
fortress
of
raichur
collected
all
his
forces
and
marched
with
an
immense
host
from
vijayanagar
in
a
direction
it
was
the
dry
season
and
he
probably
set
out
in
february
or
march
the
weather
must
have
been
intensely
hot
during
his
advance
and
still
more
so
during
the
campaign
but
the
cotton
plains
that
lay
on
his
route
out
and
home
were
then
in
the
best
condition
for
the
passage
of
his
troops
guns
and
baggage
his
enormous
army
consisted
of
about
a
million
of
men
if
the
be
included
for
the
fighting
men
alone
according
to
nuniz
numbered
about
with
elephants
the
troops
advanced
in
eleven
great
divisions
or
army
corps
and
other
troops
joined
him
before
raichur
he
pitched
his
camp
on
the
eastern
side
of
that
citadel
invested
the
place
and
began
a
regular
siege
after
an
interval
he
received
intelligence
of
the
arrival
of
the
adil
shah
from
bijapur
on
the
north
side
of
the
krishna
with
an
army
of
horse
and
foot
to
oppose
him
having
for
a
few
days
rested
his
troops
the
sultan
crossed
the
river
advanced
according
to
nuniz
to
within
nine
miles
of
raichur
and
there
entrenched
himself
leaving
the
river
about
five
miles
in
his
rear
firishtah
however
differs
and
says
that
the
muhammadan
forces
crossed
directly
in
face
of
the
hindu
army
encamped
on
the
opposite
bank
on
saturday
morning
may
in
the
year
according
to
my
deductions
the
forces
became
engaged
and
a
decisive
pitched
battle
was
fought
krishna
deva
making
no
attempt
to
outflank
his
adversary
ordered
an
advance
to
his
immediate
front
of
his
two
forward
divisions
their
attack
was
so
far
successful
that
they
drove
the
muhammadans
back
to
their
trenches
the
sultan
had
apparently
deployed
his
force
over
too
wide
an
area
expecting
that
the
raya
would
do
the
same
but
finding
himself
weak
in
the
centre
he
opened
fire
from
the
guns
that
he
had
previously
held
in
reserve
and
by
this
means
caused
great
loss
in
the
close
ranks
of
the
hindus
the
troops
fell
back
in
face
of
this
formidable
bombardment
and
at
once
their
enemies
charged
them
the
retreat
was
changed
to
a
rout
and
for
a
mile
and
a
half
to
their
direct
front
the
mussulman
cavalry
chased
the
flying
forces
belonging
to
krishna
deva
first
line
the
king
himself
who
commanded
the
second
line
began
to
despair
of
victory
but
rallied
his
troops
collected
about
him
a
number
of
his
nobles
and
determined
to
face
death
with
the
bravery
that
had
always
characterised
him
mounting
his
horse
he
ordered
a
forward
movement
of
the
whole
of
his
remaining
divisions
and
charged
the
now
disordered
ranks
of
the
mussulmans
this
resulted
in
complete
success
for
the
enemy
scattered
and
unable
to
form
fled
before
his
impetuous
onslaught
he
drove
them
the
whole
way
back
to
and
into
the
river
where
terrific
slaughter
took
place
and
their
entire
army
was
put
to
flight
the
raya
then
crossed
the
river
and
seized
the
shah
camp
while
the
shah
himself
by
the
counsel
and
help
of
asada
khan
a
man
who
afterwards
became
very
famous
escaped
only
with
his
life
and
fled
from
the
field
on
an
elephant
while
being
driven
back
towards
the
river
salabat
khan
the
general
made
a
valiant
attempt
to
retrieve
the
fortunes
of
the
day
he
had
for
his
bodyguard
portuguese
renegades
and
with
him
these
men
threw
themselves
into
the
advancing
ranks
of
the
hindus
where
they
did
such
wonderful
deeds
that
ever
after
they
were
remembered
they
penetrated
the
king
host
and
cut
their
way
forwards
till
they
almost
reached
his
person
here
salabat
khan
lost
his
horse
but
at
once
mounted
another
and
pressed
on
the
little
force
was
however
surrounded
and
annihilated
and
the
general
being
a
second
time
overthrown
horse
and
all
was
made
prisoner
the
spoil
was
great
and
the
result
decisive
for
years
afterwards
the
moors
cherished
a
wholesome
dread
of
krishna
raya
and
his
valiant
troops
and
the
sultan
never
again
during
his
lifetime
ventured
to
attack
the
dominions
of
vijayanagar
krishna
deva
flushed
with
victory
returned
at
once
to
the
attack
of
raichur
and
the
fortress
was
after
a
short
time
captured
its
fall
was
due
in
great
measure
to
the
assistance
rendered
by
some
portuguese
headed
by
christovao
de
figueiredo
who
with
their
arquebusses
picked
off
the
defenders
from
the
walls
and
thus
enabled
the
besiegers
to
approach
close
to
the
lines
of
fortification
and
pull
down
the
stones
of
which
they
were
formed
driven
to
desperation
and
their
governor
being
slain
the
garrison
surrendered
date
of
the
battle
now
as
to
the
date
of
this
battle
i
am
bold
enough
to
believe
and
defend
my
belief
that
when
nuniz
fixed
the
day
of
the
great
fight
as
the
new
moon
day
of
the
month
of
may
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
year
and
should
have
written
the
chronicler
states
that
krishna
deva
was
prepared
to
give
battle
on
a
friday
but
was
persuaded
by
his
councillors
to
postpone
his
attack
till
the
following
day
friday
being
unlucky
the
battle
accordingly
took
place
on
the
saturday
which
was
the
new
moon
day
before
proceeding
to
examine
the
month
and
day
let
us
consider
the
year
of
the
battle
paes
describes
two
grand
festivals
at
the
capital
of
which
he
was
an
and
at
which
christovao
de
figueiredo
was
present
he
fixes
definitely
the
days
on
which
these
occurred
the
first
was
the
mahanavami
festival
and
the
second
was
the
festival
of
the
new
year
day
paes
states
that
on
the
occasion
when
he
was
present
the
mahanavami
began
on
september
estas

a

de

e

and
the

began

com

e
elles
nao
contao
o
mes
se

de

a

previously
to
this
when
writing
about
raichur
paes
has
described
that
place
as
a
city
that
formerly
belonged
to
the
king
of
narsymga
vijayanagar
there
has
been
much
war
over
it
and
this
king
took
it
from
the
ydallcao
adil
shah
the
chronicler
therefore
was
present
at
these
feasts
on
an
occasion
subsequent
to
the
date
of
krishna
deva
conquest
of
raichur
now
the
mahanavami
festival
begins
in
these
tracts
on
the
of
the
month
of
asvina
and
the
new
year
day
in
the
time
of
paes
was
evidently
celebrated
on
the
of
the
month
karttika
as
was
often
the
case
in
former
years
both
days
being
the
days
following
the
moment
of
new
moon
in
what
year
then
during
the
reign
of
krishna
deva
raya
did
the
of
asvina
and
the
of
karttika
fall
respectively
on
september
and
on
october
i
have
worked
these
dates
out
for
all
the
years
of
the
reign
and
i
find
that
in
no
year
except
did
this
occur
in
the
mahanavami
fell
on
september
and
the
new
year
day
on
october
in
the
former
fell
on
september
and
the
latter
on
october
this
shows
that
paes
assisted
at
the
festivals
of
and
that
therefore
the
battle
and
capture
of
raichur
must
have
taken
place
before
the
month
of
september
in
that
year
this
again
throws
fresh
light
on
the
magnificent
reception
accorded
to
christovao
de
figueiredo
by
the
king
and
the
latter
exceptional
kindness
to
the
portuguese
at
the
time
of
these
feasts
krishna
raya
cherished
an
especial
fondness
for
christovao
on
account
of
his
invaluable
aid
at
the
siege
of
the
city
and
for
the
fact
that
but
for
him
the
war
might
have
lasted
much
longer
let
us
now
turn
to
the
other
portuguese
writers
and
see
whether
they
confirm
our
date
for
the
fall
of
raichur
the
decision
of
this
question
turns
mainly
on
the
date
when
the
portuguese
obtained
the
mainlands
opposite
the
island
of
goa
consisting
of
the
tracts
called
salsette
ponda
and
bardes
it
seems
certain
that
this
capture
of
the
mainlands
took
place
by
krishna
connivance
shortly
after
the
fall
of
raichur
at
a
time
when
diogo
lopes
de
sequeira
the
was
away
at
the
red
sea
and
when
ruy
de
mello
was
governor
of
goa
now
sequeira
left
goa
for
the
red
sea
on
february
and
arrived
again
before
diu
in
india
on
february
castanheda
tells
us
and
he
is
a
good
authority
since
he
was
in
india
in
that
while
sequeira
was
absent
at
the
red
sea
war
broke
out
between
the
king
of
vijayanagar
and
the
adil
shah
at
the
close
of
which
the
latter
was
defeated
and
put
to
flight
while
the
hindus
took
raichur
and
other
places
so
that
many
of
the
tanadaris
near
goa
on
the
mainland
were
left
undefended
and
since
the
king
of
narsinga
was
very
rich
and
had
no
need
of
these
lands
and
wanted
that
all
the
horses
that
came
to
goa
should
come
to
him
and
none
to
the
hidalcao
he
sent
to
say
to
ruy
de
mello
captain
of
goa
that
he
had
taken
belgaum
by
force
of
arms
from
the
hidalcao
with
all
the
land
appertaining
to
it
as
far
as
the
sea
in
which
were
tanadaris
yielding
more
than
gold
pardaos
of
which
he
desired
to
make
a
present
to
the
king
of
portugal
and
that
he
wanted
all
the
horses
that
came
to
goa
he
therefore
said
that
the
captain
of
goa
could
enter
and
take
possession
of
the
tanadaris
this
was
immediately
done
and
ruy
de
mello
took
possession
of
the
mainland
of
goa
including
salsette
in
ten
days
correa
who
was
in
india
at
the
time
having
gone
thither
in
or
mentions
that
de
sequeira
left
goa
for
the
red
sea
in
january
and
that
at
that
time
neste
tempo
the
expression
is
unfortunately
vague
war
broke
out
between
vijayanagar
and
bijapur
after
its
close
the
hindu
king
sent
a
message
to
ruy
de
mello
captain
of
goa
in
the
absence
of
the
regarding
the
mainlands
of
goa
correa
does
not
mention
distinctly
the
year
in
which
this
occurred
but
the
edition
of
at
the
head
of
the
page
has
the
date
this
however
must
be
an
error
on
the
part
of
the
editor
for
in
may
sequeira
was
not
absent
and
therefore
the
year
referred
to
can
not
be
while
in
may
dom
duarte
de
menezes
and
not
sequeira
was
sequeira
sailed
for
portugal
january
barros
relates
the
departure
of
de
sequeira
from
india
for
the
red
sea
on
february
and
states
that
in
his
absence
ruy
de
mello
was
governor
of
goa
under
sequeira
lieutenant
aleixo
de
menezes
ruy
de
mello
seized
the
mainland
of
goa
after
the
battle
of
raichur
and
at
that
time
de
sequeira
was
absent
at
the
red
sea
his
description
of
the
siege
of
raichur
and
the
great
battle
in
the
vicinity
clearly
seems
to
have
been
taken
from
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
it
follows
the
latter
blindly
even
in
the
misspelling
of
names
and
therefore
is
really
of
no
greater
value
when
however
barros
comes
to
deal
with
the
acquisition
of
the
mainlands
of
goa
he
is
dependent
on
other
information
and
gives
a
much
more
detailed
account
the
time
is
clearly
fixed
after
the
battle
and
flight
of
the
adil
shah
the
feeling
between
the
two
adversaries
was
naturally
highly
strained
and
this
enabled
ruy
de
mello
captain
of
goa
to
take
the
mainlands
of
goa
sequeira
was
at
the
red
sea
and
menezes
at
cochin
a
very
important
passage
for
my
present
purpose
occurs
a
little
later
on
in
barros
work
diogo
lopes
de
sequeira
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
goa
from
the
red
sea
all
necessary
arrangements
having
been
made
for
the
government
of
the
city
and
principally
of
the
mainlands
which
he
found
that
ruy
de
mello
had
taken
went
to
cochin
and
thence
to
diu
where
he
arrived
on
february
another
passage
farther
on
in
the
narrative
of
barros
also
establishes
the
fact
that
ruy
de
mello
took
the
lands
during
sequeira
absence
at
the
red
sea
faria
y
souza
a
spanish
writer
whose
work
was
first
published
a
century
after
these
events
confirms
the
period
february
to
february
as
that
of
sequeira
absence
at
the
red
sea
and
he
writes
while
the
governor
was
in
the
red
sea
the
king
crisnao
rao
of
bisnaga
covered
the
plains
and
hills
and
stopped
the
flow
of
the
rivers
with
an
army
of
thousand
horse
seven
hundred
and
thousand
foot
and
five
hundred
and
elephants
carrying
castles
with
four
men
in
each
and
twelve
thousand
watermen
and
baggage
in
such
quantities
that
the
courtesans
alone
numbered
more
than
twenty
thousand
souza
also
states
as
does
nuniz
that
after
the
defeat
of
the
adil
shah
krishna
deva
raya
demanded
that
as
the
price
of
peace
the
former
should
visit
him
and
kiss
his
foot
and
that
taking
advantage
of
the
adil
shah
difficulties
ruy
de
mello
seized
the
mainlands
of
goa
it
is
clear
therefore
that
both
authors
are
writing
of
the
same
event
osorio
a
later
writer
confirms
the
story
in
most
of
its
details
stating
that
after
the
defeat
of
the
adil
shah
krishna
raya
sent
to
ruy
de
mello
roderigo
melos
captain
of
goa
offering
the
mainlands
and
promising
after
the
return
of
sequeira
to
send
a
regular
embassy
to
conclude
a
solemn
treaty
de
mello
accordingly
took
the
mainlands
lafitau
also
states
that
the
war
took
place
during
absence
at
the
red
sea
and
that
the
mainlands
were
taken
after
the
adil
shah
defeat
turning
to
firishtah
i
find
a
difference
he
states
that
the
battle
of
raichur
took
place
in
hijra
december
to
december
which
if
it
was
fought
in
may
as
nuniz
declares
makes
the
date
may
that
he
is
speaking
of
the
same
affair
is
obvious
from
the
details
given
he
mentions
for
instance
the
vast
host
constituting
the
hindu
army
the
shah
force
advancing
to
the
river
krishna
the
too
hasty
crossing
of
the
river
the
gallant
fight
of
the
muhammadans
their
defeat
and
rout
the
fact
of
the
adil
forces
being
driven
to
the
river
and
perishing
in
large
numbers
while
attempting
to
it
the
shah
narrow
escape
and
his
dependence
on
asada
khan
all
this
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
the
only
difference
is
that
whereas
we
learn
from
the
other
authorities
that
the
fortress
of
raichur
was
in
the
hands
of
the
muhammadans
firishtah
states
that
the
war
arose
because
the
adil
shah
made
preparations
for
marching
to
recover
mudkul
and
roijore
from
the
roy
of
beejanuggur
as
if
the
latter
were
then
in
possession
of
those
places
as
to
firishtah
date
i
believe
it
to
be
wrong
by
one
year
for
the
reasons
given
above
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
wrote
many
years
after
the
event
having
thus
i
hope
satisfactorily
established
the
fact
that
the
date
given
by
nuniz
for
the
battle
of
raichur
is
wrong
by
two
years
and
should
be
i
turn
to
examine
the
day
and
month
it
was
the
new
moon
day
of
may
according
to
nuniz
and
a
saturday
krishna
deva
raya
was
ready
for
battle
on
the
friday
but
postponed
his
attack
to
the
next
day
since
friday
was
considered
an
unlucky
day
the
moment
of
the
occurrence
of
new
moon
in
may
was
on
the
morning
of
thursday
may
we
do
not
know
whether
nuniz
ascertained
his
facts
from
native
almanacks
or
the
calculations
of
the
astrologers
or
whether
he
spoke
from
observations
made
by
himself
or
by
some
one
who
was
present
but
nuniz
was
an
ordinary
person
not
a
skilled
astronomer
so
far
as
we
can
tell
and
he
may
well
have
called
the
day
on
which
the
crescent
of
the
new
moon
first
made
its
appearance
just
after
sunset
the
new
moon
day
this
first
appearance
actually
took
place
on
the
saturday
following
the
first
day
of
the
muhammadan
month
jamada
l
akhir
corresponding
to
the
heliacal
rising
of
the
moon
on
that
occasion
was
saturday
may
i
therefore
believe
that
this
great
battle
took
place
on
saturday
may
a
date
almost
synchronous
with
the
of
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
the
number
of
troops
engaged
when
we
total
up
the
list
given
by
nuniz
of
the
columns
that
marched
from
vijayanagar
for
the
campaign
the
amount
is
so
huge
that
we
pause
in
natural
doubt
as
to
whether
the
story
could
by
any
possibility
be
true
foot
horse
and
elephants
besides
the
camp
followers
merchants
and
an
infinitude
of
people
who
joined
him
at
a
place
close
to
raichur
it
certainly
demands
a
large
strain
on
our
credulity
let
every
one
form
his
own
opinion
i
can
only
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
large
armies
seem
to
have
always
been
the
rule
in
india
and
that
certainly
krishna
raya
had
the
power
to
raise
immense
numbers
of
troops
though
whether
so
many
as
is
stated
is
another
question
his
power
to
do
so
lay
in
his
mode
of
government
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
this
and
nuniz
gives
us
interesting
details
the
whole
empire
was
divided
into
provinces
and
estates
held
by
chiefs
bound
to
keep
up
masses
of
troops
fit
for
immediate
service
it
is
of
course
natural
to
suppose
that
in
this
great
war
the
king
would
have
put
forth
all
his
strength
to
prove
that
immense
armies
were
often
employed
by
indian
kings
we
have
only
to
refer
to
a
succession
of
writers
barros
notes
the
great
power
of
the
sovereign
of
vijayanagar
and
his
almost
incredible
richness
and
is
at
pains
to
give
an
account
of
how
these
enormous
forces
were
raised
lest
his
tale
should
not
be
believed
in
the
second
volume
of
scott
history
of
the
dekhan
a
translation
is
given
of
a
journal
kept
by
a
bondela
officer
in
the
reign
of
aurangzib
an
officer
who
served
under
dulput
roy
in
writing
about
vijayanagar
in
former
days
at
the
height
of
its
grandeur
and
importance
he
says
they
kept
an
army
of
horse
a
million
of
infantry
and
their
wealth
was
beyond
enumeration
conti
who
was
in
india
about
a
century
earlier
than
the
war
in
question
told
bracciolini
that
the
vijayanagar
army
consisted
of
a
million
of
men
and
upwards
abdur
razzak
tells
the
same
story
putting
the
number
at
with
elephants
twenty
years
later
nikitin
states
that
the
kulbarga
forces
marching
to
attack
the
hindus
amounted
to
foot
horse
and
elephants
the
sultan
himself
independently
of
his
nobles
took
the
field
with
men
and
even
when
he
only
went
out
on
a
hunting
expedition
he
took
with
him
a
train
of
horse
foot
and
elephants
he
states
that
the
malik
ul
tujar
alone
had
an
army
of
employed
in
the
siege
of
one
city
the
hindus
fought
almost
nude
and
were
armed
with
shield
and
sword
even
so
far
back
as
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
about
the
army
of
magadha
was
computed
by
the
greeks
as
consisting
of
foot
cavalry
and
elephants
though
quintus
curtius
makes
a
much
more
modest
estimate
lord
egerton
of
tatton
states
that
an
army
of
hindu
confederated
states
mustered
for
the
defence
of
northern
indict
against
the
muhammadan
invasion
in
amounted
according
to
the
most
moderate
estimate
to
horse
elephants
and
a
great
number
of
infantry
in
a
mogul
embassy
was
received
at
delhi
by
an
escort
of
horse
and
was
led
past
lines
of
infantry
numbering
as
many
as
in
their
ranks
it
will
be
remembered
how
muhammad
taghlaq
of
delhi
raised
according
to
firishtah
an
army
of
men
for
the
conquest
of
persia
and
when
he
wanted
to
destroy
the
inhabitants
of
a
certain
tract
of
country
he
ordered
out
his
army
as
if
he
were
going
hunting
surrounded
the
tract
and
then
pressing
inwards
towards
the
centre
slaughtered
all
the
inhabitants
therein
this
implies
that
he
took
when
merely
hunting
immense
numbers
of
men
with
him
indeed
declared
that
muhammad
taghlaq
had
an
army
of
horse
and
nuniz
on
the
opening
page
of
his
chronicle
says
that
this
sultan
invaded
the
balaghat
with
horse
this
estimate
was
of
course
only
according
to
the
tradition
extant
in
faria
y
souza
writing
in
the
seventeenth
century
estimated
the
forces
of
bahadur
king
of
cambay
in
as
horse
foot
and
elephants
as
late
as
the
mahrattas
are
said
to
have
had
an
army
of
horse
nuniz
gives
details
of
the
provincial
forces
of
vijayanagar
compulsorily
maintained
by
eleven
out
of
a
total
of
two
hundred
nobles
amongst
whom
the
empire
was
divided
and
the
total
of
the
forces
of
these
eleven
amounts
to
horse
foot
and
elephants
castanheda
confirms
other
writers
in
this
matter
stating
that
the
infantry
of
vijayanagar
were
countless
the
country
being
of
large
extent
and
thickly
populated
so
that
the
king
could
call
upon
a
million
or
even
two
millions
of
men
at
will
this
writer
visited
india
just
at
the
close
of
the
reign
of
krishna
deva
raya
he
states
that
the
king
kept
up
at
his
own
cost
an
establishment
of
horses
and
elephants
as
to
all
this
i
repeat
that
every
one
is
at
liberty
to
form
his
own
opinion
but
at
least
it
seems
certain
that
all
the
chroniclers
believed
that
the
king
of
vijayanagar
could
if
he
so
desired
put
into
the
field
immense
masses
of
armed
men
they
were
probably
not
all
well
armed
or
well
trained
or
well
disciplined
but
as
to
large
numbers
there
can
be
little
reasonable
doubt
a
relic
of
this
may
be
seen
every
year
at
modern
haidarabad
the
capital
city
of
the
nizam
where
at
the
annual
festival
known
as
the
langar
armed
irregulars
in
very
large
numbers
file
through
the
principal
streets
they
are
for
the
most
part
a
mere
mob
of
men
with
weapons
and
are
not
maintained
as
state
troops
but
they
are
brought
up
by
the
various
nobles
in
separate
bodies
each
chief
mustering
for
the
occasion
all
his
hereditary
retainers
and
forming
them
into
rough
regiments
and
brigades
as
to
the
description
given
by
nuniz
of
the
offensive
armour
of
the
elephants
which
are
stated
to
have
gone
into
battle
with
long
swords
like
scythes
attached
to
their
trunks
the
story
is
confirmed
by
many
other
writers
firishtah
narrative
firishtah
account
of
the
battle
of
raichur
is
interesting
as
it
gives
a
description
of
the
affair
from
the
enemy
point
of
view
ismail
adil
shah
marched
to
recover
mudkul
and
roijore
from
the
roy
of
beejanugger
who
gaining
early
intelligence
of
his
designs
moved
with
a
great
force
and
stationed
his
camp
on
the
bank
of
the
kistnah
where
he
was
joined
by
many
of
his
tributaries
so
that
the
army
amounted
at
least
to
horse
besides
a
vast
host
of
foot
the
sultan
would
now
have
delayed
his
expedition
as
the
enemy
possessed
all
the
ferries
of
the
kistnah
but
that
his
tents
were
pitched
and
it
would
have
been
disgraceful
to
retract
from
his
declarations
he
therefore
marched
with
horse
all
foreign
and
encamped
on
the
bank
of
the
river
opposite
to
the
enemy
waiting
to
prepare
floats
to
cross
and
attack
them
some
days
after
his
arrival
as
he
was
reposing
in
his
tent
he
heard
one
of
the
courtiers
without
the
skreens
reciting
this
verse
and
fill
the
golden
goblet
with
the
wine
of
mirth
before
the
cup
itself
shall
be
laid
in
dust
the
sultan
inspired
by
the
verse
called
his
favourites
before
him
and
spreading
the
carpet
of
pleasure
amused
himself
with
music
and
wine
when
the
banquet
had
lasted
longer
than
was
reasonable
and
the
fumes
of
the
wine
had
exercised
their
power
a
fancy
seized
the
sultan
to
pass
the
river
and
attack
the
enemy
warm
with
wine
he
resolved
to
cross
immediately
and
mounting
his
elephant
without
making
his
intentions
known
proceeded
to
the
river
as
if
to
reconnoitre
but
suddenly
gave
orders
for
as
many
of
his
troops
as
could
to
go
upon
the
rafts
and
others
to
follow
him
on
elephants
through
the
river
the
officers
represented
the
folly
and
danger
of
precipitation
but
the
sultan
without
reply
plunged
his
own
elephant
into
the
stream
and
was
followed
involuntarily
by
the
amras
and
their
followers
on
about
elephants
by
great
good
fortune
all
reached
the
opposite
shore
in
safety
and
as
many
troops
as
could
cross
on
the
floats
at
two
embarkations
had
time
to
arrive
when
the
enemy
advanced
to
battle
in
so
great
force
as
excluded
every
probable
hope
of
escape
to
the
sultan
who
had
not
more
than
men
ready
to
oppose
the
heroes
of
islaam
animated
with
one
soul
made
so
gallant
a
resistance
that
about
a
thousand
of
the
infidels
fell
among
whom
was
sunjeet
roy
the
chief
general
of
beejanuggur
but
at
last
harassed
beyond
all
power
of
opposition
by
musquetry
and
rockets
which
destroyed
near
half
their
numbers
the
survivors
threw
themselves
into
the
river
in
hopes
of
escaping
and
nursoo
bahadur
and
ibrahim
bey
who
rode
on
the
same
elephant
with
ismaeel
adil
shaw
drove
the
animal
across
the
stream
but
so
great
was
the
current
that
except
the
royal
elephant
and
seven
soldiers
all
the
rest
were
drowned
the
sultan
rashness
was
heavily
punished
by
so
great
a
loss
he
took
a
solemn
vow
never
to
indulge
in
wine
till
he
had
revenged
his
defeat
and
then
throwing
away
despair
busied
his
mind
in
repairing
this
unfortunate
miscarriage
as
mirza
jehangeer
had
fallen
in
the
action
the
sultan
consulted
with
assud
khan
on
what
measures
would
be
best
to
take
in
the
present
crisis
of
his
affairs
assud
khan
replied
that
as
his
loss
was
great
and
the
troops
dispirited
it
would
be
better
for
the
present
to
retreat
to
beejapore
the
sultan
approving
the
advice
marched
from
the
kistnah
to
beejapore
and
conferring
the
dignity
of
sippeh
sallar
on
assud
khan
added
several
districts
to
his
jaghire
and
made
him
his
principal
adviser
in
all
important
affairs
comparison
of
accounts
comparing
this
account
with
that
given
by
nuniz
there
can
i
think
be
little
doubt
that
both
stories
refer
to
the
same
event
though
there
are
of
course
several
discrepancies
the
origin
of
the
war
is
related
differently
firishtah
states
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
sultan
at
the
he
found
the
hindu
army
encamped
on
the
opposite
side
he
crossed
after
a
few
days
delay
with
a
small
force
and
was
driven
into
the
river
nuniz
says
that
krishna
deva
raya
heard
of
ismail
adil
arrival
on
the
while
he
himself
was
in
camp
at
raichur
fifteen
miles
away
and
that
he
advanced
and
gave
battle
nine
miles
from
the
river
in
the
end
driving
the
enemy
across
but
taking
the
two
narratives
as
a
whole
there
are
too
many
points
of
coincidence
to
leave
any
doubt
in
the
mind
that
each
chronicler
is
writing
of
the
same
event
as
to
which
of
the
two
is
more
accurate
it
is
impossible
now
to
decide
but
considering
that
nuniz
wrote
only
fifteen
years
afterwards
and
that
there
were
portuguese
present
at
the
battle
some
of
whom
nuniz
may
have
personally
consulted
as
to
what
took
place
it
would
seem
more
reasonable
to
trust
in
him
rather
than
in
a
muhammadan
historian
who
did
not
compile
his
work
till
after
an
interval
of
sixty
years
moreover
there
are
some
inherent
improbabilities
in
firishtah
narrative
it
is
worthy
of
notice
too
that
throughout
the
story
of
nuniz
at
this
part
of
his
chronicle
there
is
much
that
impels
the
belief
that
either
himself
or
his
informant
was
present
at
the
hindu
camp
while
these
events
were
taking
place
the
narrative
of
the
campaign
in
complete
contrast
to
that
of
the
remainder
of
the
history
reads
like
the
account
of
an
especially
in
the
passages
describing
the
fortress
of
raichur
and
the
camp
where
the
supplies
were
so
great
that
you
could
find
everything
that
you
wanted
where
you
saw
the
goldsmiths
and
artisans
at
work
as
if
in
a
city
where
you
will
find
all
kinds
of
precious
stones
offered
for
sale
and
where
no
one
who
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
would
ever
dream
that
a
war
was
going
on
but
would
think
that
he
was
in
a
prosperous
city
note
also
the
description
given
of
the
extraordinary
noise
made
by
the
drums
trumpets
and
shouts
of
the
men
so
that
even
the
birds
fell
down
into
the
soldiers
hands
stricken
with
terror
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
sky
would
fall
to
the
earth
and
if
you
asked
anything
you
could
not
hear
yourself
speak
and
you
had
to
ask
by
signs
many
such
instances
might
be
given
but
not
to
be
tedious
i
will
invite
attention
to
only
three
more
the
account
given
by
nuniz
of
how
when
receiving
the
men
of
the
city
after
its
surrender
the
king
casting
his
eye
on
christovao
de
figueiredo
nodded
his
head
and
turned
to
the
people
telling
them
to
observe
what
great
things
could
be
effected
by
one
good
man
his
description
of
the
behaviour
of
the
defeated
citizens
when
krishna
deva
made
his
triumphant
entry
into
the
city
and
his
narrative
of
the
ambassador
reception
at
vijayanagar
by
the
king
after
the
conclusion
of
the
campaign
it
may
be
remembered
that
our
other
chronicler
domingo
paes
was
at
vijayanagar
with
christovao
de
figueiredo
some
months
after
the
battle
even
if
he
were
not
personally
present
in
the
fighting
at
raichur
the
great
interest
of
nuniz
narrative
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
detailed
account
extant
barros
related
the
events
in
historical
fashion
taking
his
facts
from
this
very
chronicle
but
he
was
never
in
india
and
his
brief
summary
is
altogether
wanting
in
the
power
and
force
contained
in
the
graphic
story
of
nuniz
the
other
portuguese
writers
pass
over
the
war
very
lightly
it
appears
as
if
it
hardly
concerned
then
further
than
that
at
its
close
ruy
de
mello
seized
the
mainlands
near
goa
political
effects
of
the
battle
and
yet
it
had
effects
the
hindu
victory
so
weakened
the
power
and
prestige
of
the
adil
shah
that
he
ceased
altogether
to
dream
of
any
present
conquest
in
the
south
and
turned
his
attention
to
cementing
alliances
with
the
other
muhammadan
sovereigns
his
neighbours
the
victory
also
caused
all
the
other
muhammadan
powers
in
the
dakhan
seriously
to
consider
the
political
condition
of
the
country
and
this
eventually
led
to
a
combination
without
which
nothing
was
possible
but
by
the
aid
of
which
the
vijayanagar
empire
was
finally
overthrown
and
the
way
to
the
south
opened
it
furthermore
greatly
affected
the
hindus
by
raising
in
them
a
spirit
of
pride
and
arrogance
which
added
fuel
to
the
fire
caused
them
to
become
positively
intolerable
to
their
neighbours
and
accelerated
their
own
downfall
it
equally
affected
the
fortunes
of
the
portuguese
on
the
coast
goa
rose
and
fell
simultaneously
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
second
vijayanagar
dynasty
and
necessarily
so
considering
that
its
entire
trade
depended
on
hindu
support
for
the
king
of
portugal
was
never
well
disposed
towards
his
hereditary
enemies
the
moors
this
is
a
point
frequently
left
unnoticed
by
writers
on
portuguese
colonial
history
the
two
most
recent
authors
of
works
on
the
subject
danvers
the
portuguese
in
india
and
whiteway
the
rise
of
portuguese
power
in
india
pay
very
little
attention
to
the
internal
politics
of
the
great
country
on
the
fringe
alone
of
which
the
portuguese
settled
and
on
the
coast
of
which
their
vessels
came
and
went
danvers
devotes
one
short
paragraph
to
the
battle
of
raichur
and
another
to
the
destruction
of
vijayanagar
whiteway
does
not
even
allude
to
the
former
event
and
concludes
his
history
before
arriving
at
the
date
of
the
latter
yet
surely
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
success
or
failure
of
maritime
trade
on
any
given
coast
must
depend
on
the
conditions
prevailing
in
the
empire
for
the
supply
of
which
that
trade
was
established
when
vijayanagar
with
its
grandeur
luxury
and
love
of
display
its
great
wealth
and
its
enormous
armies
was
at
the
height
of
its
power
the
foreign
traders
were
eminently
successful
when
vijayanagar
fell
and
the
city
became
desolate
and
depopulated
the
foreign
traders
had
no
market
for
their
goods
and
trade
decayed
so
that
this
great
hindu
victory
at
raichur
deserved
a
better
fate
than
to
be
passed
over
by
the
historians
as
if
it
had
been
an
event
of
small
importance
the
events
that
followed
the
battle
nuniz
gives
us
in
detail
an
account
of
the
events
that
followed
the
victory
of
krishna
deva
raya
and
considering
that
he
wrote
only
about
fifteen
years
after
their
occurrence
we
should
do
well
to
receive
his
account
as
probably
true
in
the
main
firishtah
perhaps
naturally
preserves
a
complete
silence
on
the
subject
nuniz
tells
us
that
when
the
city
of
raichur
surrendered
the
hindu
king
made
a
triumphal
entry
into
it
and
treated
the
garrison
with
kindness
and
consideration
while
the
other
muhammadan
kings
sent
envoys
to
krishna
deva
raya
on
hearing
of
his
success
and
received
a
haughty
and
irritating
reply
krishna
deva
then
returned
to
vijayanagar
and
held
high
festival
shortly
afterwards
an
ambassador
arrived
from
the
defeated
shah
and
was
treated
with
scant
courtesy
for
more
than
a
month
after
which
he
was
received
in
audience
when
the
king
sent
answer
by
him
to
his
enemy
that
if
the
adil
shah
would
come
to
him
do
obeisance
and
kiss
his
foot
his
lands
and
fortresses
should
be
restored
to
him
no
attention
being
paid
to
this
the
raya
set
out
to
search
for
the
shah
hoping
that
he
would
be
induced
to
do
homage
in
the
manner
demanded
and
appearing
to
ignore
altogether
the
effect
which
would
necessarily
be
produced
on
the
minds
of
the
other
kings
of
the
dakhan
by
this
contemplated
supreme
humiliation
of
one
of
their
number
the
submission
never
took
place
krishna
led
his
army
as
far
north
as
bijapur
the
adil
shah
capital
which
for
a
time
he
occupied
and
left
sadly
injured
then
asada
khan
the
shah
wily
courtier
successfully
brought
about
the
death
of
his
personal
enemy
salabat
khan
by
inducing
the
raya
to
order
his
execution
an
act
to
which
the
king
was
led
by
the
machinations
of
the
who
subordinated
his
chief
interests
to
his
own
selfish
ends
king
krishna
had
in
the
city
of
bijapur
taken
prisoner
three
sons
of
a
former
king
of
the
bahmani
dynasty
who
had
been
held
captive
by
the
adil
shahs
and
he
proclaimed
the
eldest
as
king
of
the
dakhan
this
abortive
attempt
to
subvert
the
rule
of
the
five
kings
who
had
established
themselves
on
the
ruins
of
the
single
dakhan
sovereignty
naturally
fell
flat
and
only
resulted
in
stiffening
the
hostility
which
these
sovereigns
felt
towards
their
common
foe
a
little
later
krishna
raya
son
a
young
prince
on
whom
he
desired
to
confer
his
crown
and
in
whose
favour
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
openly
to
abdicate
died
suddenly
of
poison
and
the
king
then
himself
in
a
dying
condition
arrested
and
imprisoned
his
own
minister
saluva
timma
and
his
family
in
this
he
was
aided
by
some
portuguese
who
happened
to
be
present
at
the
durbar
on
saluva
timma
son
escaping
to
a
mountain
range
perhaps
sandur
on
the
south
of
the
capital
where
there
are
still
to
be
seen
the
remains
of
a
strong
fortress
built
of
cyclopean
masonry
on
the
summit
of
the
highest
hill
now
known
as
ramandrug
the
king
summoned
timma
and
his
brother
and
son
and
had
their
eyes
put
out
about
this
time
the
adil
shah
advanced
again
to
retrieve
his
broken
fortunes
but
fled
incontinently
on
hearing
the
news
that
krishna
deva
was
advancing
in
person
to
meet
him
that
the
king
though
sorely
ill
did
indeed
move
in
the
manner
stated
seems
to
be
confirmed
by
the
statement
of
nuniz
that
on
the
way
he
bought
six
hundred
horses
from
the
portuguese
krishna
began
to
make
preparations
for
an
attack
on
belgaum
then
in
the
adil
shah
possession
and
sent
an
envoy
to
invite
the
assistance
in
this
enterprise
of
the
portuguese
at
goa
but
he
fell
too
seriously
ill
to
carry
out
his
project
and
died
shortly
afterwards
at
the
age
of
from
to
years
it
was
then
the
year
he
was
succeeded
by
achyuta
so
far
nuniz
we
learn
something
more
from
other
writers
barros
states
that
about
the
year
saluva
timma
the
king
minister
invaded
the
mainlands
near
goa
which
had
been
recently
acquired
by
the
portuguese
under
ruy
de
mello
that
he
advanced
towards
ponda
with
a
small
force
but
that
he
was
attacked
and
driven
back
shortly
after
this
in
april
the
muhammadans
of
bijapur
attacked
these
same
mainlands
with
success
during
the
viceroyalty
of
dom
duarte
de
menezes
on
october
of
that
year
the
chamber
of
goa
wrote
a
report
to
the
king
of
portugal
in
which
occurs
the
following
passage
the
mainland
which
ruy
de
mello
who
was
captain
of
this
city
conquered
was
entered
by
the
moors
who
used
to
possess
it
in
the
month
of
april
of
five
hundred
and
and
they
hold
it
as
theirs
and
the
first
thanadar
district
which
they
took
was
that
of
perna
which
is
by
the
seaside
there
they
captured
two
portuguese
and
one
of
them
was
the
thanadar
these
are
prisoners
in
the
fortress
of
bylgan
belgaum
of
which
the
suffilarim
is
captain
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
moors
were
successful
and
yet
it
is
curious
that
very
little
mention
is
made
of
this
circumstance
by
other
historians
firishtah
does
not
mention
it
and
it
may
therefore
be
reasonably
inferred
that
the
moors
in
question
were
not
the
royal
troops
acting
under
the
orders
of
the
sultan
but
belonged
to
the
local
levies
of
asada
khan
then
chief
of
belgaum
according
to
firishtah
the
defeat
at
raichur
was
followed
by
ismail
adil
shah
marrying
his
sister
to
burhan
nizam
shah
of
ahmadnagar
quarrelling
and
fighting
with
him
again
fighting
with
him
marrying
another
sister
to
ummad
of
birar
and
fighting
with
and
entirely
defeating
sultan
amir
barid
of
bidar
then
an
old
man
whom
he
captured
on
the
death
of
krishna
deva
ismail
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
of
the
hindus
to
retake
possession
of
mudkal
and
raichur
firishtah
gives
no
dates
for
the
two
last
of
the
event
above
noted
but
the
submission
of
amir
barid
to
the
adil
shah
apparently
did
not
take
place
till
for
barros
implies
that
it
occurred
after
an
event
which
can
not
have
happened
earlier
than
namely
an
attack
on
ponda
by
three
hindu
chiefs
which
led
to
the
inhabitants
appealing
for
help
to
the
then
governor
of
goa
nuno
da
cunha
da
cunha
was
not
governor
till
at
this
time
writes
the
historian
melique
verido
submitted
to
the
hidalchan
by
advice
of
madre
maluco
and
cota
maluco
and
came
to
his
camp
in
poor
clothes
and
flung
himself
at
his
feet
this
evidently
refers
to
what
occurred
after
the
barid
capture
by
the
adil
shah
if
firishtah
story
is
true
let
it
be
remembered
though
the
fact
has
no
bearing
on
the
history
of
vijayanagar
at
this
date
that
in
the
emperor
babar
captured
delhi
and
established
himself
as
the
first
monarch
of
the
great
moghul
dynasty
he
was
succeeded
in
by
humayun
and
on
the
latter
death
in
the
great
akbar
attained
the
throne
chapter
the
buildings
works
and
inscriptions
of
krishna
deva
temples
irrigation
works
statue
of
narasimha
kamalapuram
inscriptions
were
it
not
that
the
description
given
us
by
nuniz
and
paes
of
the
condition
of
the
great
city
of
vijayanagar
at
this
period
is
so
graphic
so
picturesque
and
so
detailed
as
positively
to
require
no
addition
i
should
have
deemed
it
my
duty
to
attempt
to
supply
the
want
but
with
their
narrative
before
us
in
all
its
original
freshness
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
anything
further
both
of
these
writers
were
on
the
spot
at
the
time
of
the
city
greatest
grandeur
and
prosperity
though
in
the
time
of
nuniz
the
period
of
its
political
decay
had
set
in
with
their
descriptions
i
shall
not
venture
to
interfere
i
can
not
however
pass
on
to
the
reign
of
achyuta
without
calling
attention
to
some
of
the
works
carried
out
at
the
capital
by
krishna
deva
and
to
a
few
of
the
inscribed
records
of
his
reign
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
krishna
built
a
gopura
or
tower
and
repaired
another
at
the
hampe
temple
which
had
been
built
by
the
first
kings
in
honour
of
madhavacharya
the
founder
of
the
fortunes
of
vijayanagar
the
great
krishnasvami
temple
was
built
by
him
in
after
his
return
from
the
successful
campaign
in
the
east
in
the
same
year
he
commenced
the
temple
of
hazara
ramasvami
at
the
palace
the
architecture
of
which
leads
rea
to
think
that
it
was
not
finished
till
a
later
period
later
in
his
reign
the
king
busied
himself
in
improving
the
irrigation
of
the
dry
lands
about
vijayanagar
he
constructed
in
the
great
dam
and
channel
at
korragal
and
the
basavanna
channel
both
of
which
are
still
in
use
and
of
great
value
to
the
country
another
great
work
of
his
was
the
construction
of
an
enormous
tank
or
lake
at
the
capital
which
he
carried
out
with
the
aid
of
joao
de
la
ponte
a
portuguese
engineer
whose
services
were
lent
to
him
by
the
of
goa
both
paes
and
nuniz
mention
this
lake
and
as
the
former
actually
saw
it
under
construction
it
may
have
been
begun
in
i
think
that
this
is
the
large
lake
now
dry
to
be
seen
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
entering
into
the
sandur
hills
of
hospett
the
huge
bank
of
which
has
been
utilised
for
the
conveyance
of
the
highroad
from
hospett
to
the
southern
taluqs
if
so
the
fact
of
its
original
failure
is
interesting
to
us
because
for
many
years
past
this
vast
work
has
been
entirely
useless
the
description
given
by
nuniz
accords
with
the
position
of
this
tank
which
was
doubtless
intended
partly
for
irrigation
purposes
and
partly
for
the
supply
of
water
to
the
new
city
nagalapura
the
king
favourite
residence
now
known
as
hospett
the
chronicler
mentions
the
existence
of
lofty
ridges
on
each
side
strong
gates
and
towers
guarding
the
entrance
and
states
that
this
was
the
principal
approach
to
the
capital
from
the
south
all
which
data
coincide
with
the
position
of
the
tank
and
road
in
question
it
is
through
these
gates
that
the
portuguese
travellers
entered
vijayanagar
this
view
is
supported
by
the
account
given
by
paes
writing
of
the
approach
to
vijayanagar
from
the
western
coast
and
describing
the
first
range
the
first
that
is
seen
on
passing
upwards
from
the
plains
he
states
that
in
these
hills
was
the
principal
entrance
from
that
side
he
alludes
to
the
gates
and
wall
and
the
city
nagalapur
constructed
by
king
krishna
then
he
writes
the
king
made
a
tank
there
close
to
hospett
at
the
mouth
of
two
hills
and
in
order
to
this
end
broke
down
a
hill
he
saw
innumerable
people
at
work
on
the
tank
he
confirms
the
story
of
nuniz
as
to
the
sixty
human
beings
offered
in
sacrifice
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
dam
both
writers
are
therefore
describing
the
same
tank
and
taking
the
chronicles
together
i
can
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
soundness
of
my
identification
prior
to
krishna
deva
built
the
outlying
town
of
nagalapur
to
which
allusion
has
just
been
made
it
was
constructed
in
honour
of
his
favourite
wife
the
quondam
courtesan
nagala
devi
and
the
king
made
it
his
favourite
residence
he
also
appears
to
have
begun
the
construction
of
the
temple
of
vitthalasvami
on
the
the
most
ornate
of
an
the
religious
edifices
of
the
kingdom
it
shows
writes
rea
in
the
article
already
referred
to
the
extreme
limit
in
florid
magnificence
to
which
the
style
advanced
the
work
was
continued
during
the
reign
of
krishna
deva
successors

lay
near

angle
of

krishnasvami
temple
and
the
king
bestowed
a
grant
of
lands

maintenance
though
it
has
been
grievously
injured
probably
by
the
iconoclastic
muhammadans

after

is
still
a
most
striking
object
i

already
alluded
to
the
grants
made
by

the

achyuta
according

authorities
was
a
brother
of
the
late
king
and
in
company
with
two
other
brothers
and
a
nephew
had
been
confined
by
krishna
deva
in
the
fortress
of
chandragiri
in
order
to
prevent
dissensions
in
the
kingdom
the
new
monarch
is
said
by
nuniz
to
have
been
specially
selected
by
krishna
deva
if
so
the
choice
was
singularly
unfortunate
for
achyuta
was
a
craven
and
under
him
the
hindu
empire
began
to
fall
to
pieces
his
minister

of
the
powerful

also
had
belonged
timma
the
minister
of

krishna
nuniz
calls
him
salvanay
the
earliest
known
date
of
achyuta
reign
is
gathered
from
an
inscription
bearing
a
date
corresponding
to
monday
august
the
beginning
of
his
reign
was
ominously
signalised
by
the
loss
of
the
frontier
fortresses
mudkal
and
raichur
firishtah
states
that
the
adil
shah
had
some
time
before
the
death
of
krishna
deva
made
preparations
to
recover
possession
of
these
cities
and
proceeds
the
sultan
put
his
army
in
motion
attended
by
ummad
shaw
and
ameer
bereed
with
their
forces
and
the
affairs
of
beejanuggur
being
in
confusion
owing
to
the
death
of
heemraaje
who
was
newly
succeeded
by
his
son
ramraaje
against
whom
rebellions
had
arisen
by
several
roles
met
with
no
interruptions
to
his
arms
roijore
and
mudkul
were
taken
after
a
siege
of
three
months
by
capitulation
after
they
had
been
in
possession
of
the
infidels
for
seventeen
years
the
relief
and
delight
of
the
adil
shah
at
these
successes
and
at
the
death
of
his
mortal
enemy
krishna
must
have
been
great
and
firishtah
relates
that
the
sultan
who
had
vowed
to
refrain
from
wine
till
the
reduction
of
these
fortresses
at
the
request
of
his
nobility
now
made
a
splendid
festival
at
which
he
drank
wine
and
gave
a
full
loose
to
mirth
and
pleasure
raichur
and
mudkal
were
never
again
subject
to
hindu
princes
those
who
desire
to
obtain
an
insight
into
the
character
of
the
new
king
of
vijayanagar
should
turn
to
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
it
will
suffice
here
to
say
that
he
alienated
his
best
friends
by
his
violent
despotism
and
at
the
same
time
proved
to
the
whole
empire
that
he
was
a
coward
his
conduct
and
mode
of
government
ruined
the
hindu
cause
in
southern
india
and
opened
the
whole
country
to
the
invader
though
he
himself
did
not
live
to
see
the
end
after
the
fall
of
raichur
and
the
doab
ismail
adil
had
another
fight
with
his
rival
at
ahmadnagar
and
defeated
him
after
which
the
two
consolidated
a
strong
alliance
three
years
later
ismail
died
having
contracted
a
fever
while
besieging
a
fortress
belonging
to
the
qutb
shah
of
golkonda
his
death
occurred
on
thursday
august
and
he
was
succeeded
by
his
son
malu
asada
khan
was
appointed
regent
of
bijapur
but
immediately
on
his
accession
the
new
sovereign
so
offended
his
powerful
subject
that
he
retired
to
belgaum
and
sultan
malu
giving
himself
up
to
all
kinds
of
excesses
was
deposed
after
a
reign
of
only
six
months
malu
was
blinded
by
the
orders
of
his
own
grandmother
and
ibrahim
adil
his
younger
brother
was
raised
to
the
throne
it
was
now
da
cunha
the
portuguese
governor
of
goa
took
advantage
of
these
events
to
erect
a
fortress
at
diu
and
early
in
to
seize
again
the
mainlands
of
goa
which
had
been
for
ten
years
in
the
possession
of
asada
khan
the
khan
sent
a
force
to
recapture
these
lands
and
in
february
an
engagement
took
place
in
which
the
portuguese
were
victorious
a
second
attack
by
the
moslems
was
similarly
repulsed
a
third
fight
took
place
in
july
and
again
the
muhammadans
were
beaten
but
asada
khan
then
assembled
a
larger
army
and
the
foreigners
were
compelled
to
retire
after
blowing
up
their
fortress
about
this
time
quli
qutb
shah
is
said
to
have
attacked
kondavid
on
account
of
its
withholding
payment
of
tribute
to
have
taken
it
and
built
a
tower
in
the
middle
of
the
fort
in
commemoration
of
its
reduction
two
inscriptions
at
conjeeveram
dated
respectively
in
and
imply
that
at
that
period
king
achyuta
reduced
the
country
about
tinnevelly
but
apparently
he
was
not
present
in
person
and
nothing
further
is
known
regarding
this
expedition
we
now
enter
upon
a
period
very
difficult
to
deal
with
satisfactorily
owing
to
the
conflict
of
evidence
in
the
works
of
the
various
writers
a
year
after
his
accession
writes
firishtah
ibrahim
adil
led
his
army
to
beejanuggur
on
the
requisition
of
the
roy
this
would
be
the
year
but
what
led
to
such
an
extraordinary
complication
of
affairs
can
it
be
true
that
king
achyuta
was
so
humiliated
and
hard
pressed
as
to
be
compelled
to
summon
to
his
aid
the
hereditary
enemies
of
his
country
nuniz
is
silent
as
to
the
cause
though
he
admits
the
fact
it
is
quite
possible
that
firishtah
is
correct
that
the
public
were
not
taken
into
confidence
by
their
despotic
rulers
and
that
the
troops
of
bijapur
marched
to
the
hindu
capital
at
the
request
of
king
achyuta
that
they
actually
came
there
seems
quite
certain
and
it
is
probable
that
nuniz
was
in
vijayanagar
at
the
time
but
there
is
a
lacuna
in
his
story
which
can
only
be
filled
up
by
reference
to
firishtah
accepting
firishtah
we
can
readily
understand
why
king
achyuta
received
the
sultan
and
his
army
without
open
opposition
as
nuniz
declares
that
he
did
and
why
the
muhammadan
king
received
splendid
presents
before
he
retired
to
nuniz
however
this
conduct
was
inexplicable
except
on
the
basis
of
achyuta
craven
spirit
and
utter
unworthiness
as
to
the
assertion
of
nuniz
that
the
sultan
entered
nagalapur
or
hospett
and
razed
it
to
the
ground
we
may
remember
the
treatment
of
the
city
of
bijapur
by
krishna
deva
raya
and
surmise
that
the
houses
of
the
vijayanagar
suburbs
may
have
been
pulled
to
pieces
by
the
mussalman
soldiery
in
search
for
firewood
however
all
this
may
be
my
readers
have
before
them
the
story
as
given
by
nuniz
in
chapter
xx
of
his
chronicle
and
the
following
is
firishtah
account
of
the
event
heem
rajah
or
as
briggs
renders
the
name
tim
rajah
representing
timma
and
referring
doubtless
to
saluva
timma
the
great
minister
of
krishna
deva
had
forty
years
earlier
become
de
facto
ruler
of
vijayanagar
on
the
death
of
the
two
sons
of
a
former
king
seo
raya
he
had
poisoned
the
infant
son
of
the
younger
of
these
sons
and
had
thus
succeeded
in
becoming
head
of
the
state
during
these
forty
years
he
had
been
obeyed
by
all
on
his
death
his
son
rama
rajah
became
ruler
rama
marriage
to
a
daughter
of
the
son
of
seo
raya
had
greatly
added
to
his
dignity
and
power
and
he
now
tried
to
secure
the
throne
for
himself
and
his
family
he
was
however
compelled
by
the
nobles
to
recognise
as
king
an
infant
of
the
female
line
whose
person
he
committed
to
the
care
of
the
child
uncle
hoje
tirumala
raya
a
man
of
weak
intellect
if
not
absolutely
insane
in
five
or
six
years
rama
cut
off
by
treachery
most
of
the
chiefs
who
opposed
him
he
then
marched
on
an
expedition
into
malabar
and
afterwards
moved
against
a
powerful
zamindar
to
the
south
of
vijayanagar
who
held
out
for
six
months
and
in
the
end
beat
off
the
troops
of
rama
raya
vijayanagar
was
at
that
time
governed
by
a
slave
whom
rama
had
raised
to
high
rank
and
this
man
on
being
applied
to
by
the
minister
to
send
supplies
from
the
capital
was
so
amazed
at
the
wealth
which
he
saw
in
the
royal
treasury
that
he
resolved
to
attempt
to
gain
possession
of
it
he
therefore
released
the
obtained
the
of
hoje
tirumala
assumed
the
office
of
minister
and
began
to
raise
troops
several
tributary
roies
who
were
disgusted
with
ramraaje
flew
with
speed
to
beejanuggur
to
obey
their
lawful
king
and
in
a
short
time
thirty
thousand
horse
and
vast
hosts
of
foot
were
assembled
under
his
standard
at
the
city
tirumala
then
had
the
assassinated
rama
rajah
at
once
returned
to
the
capital
but
was
unable
at
that
juncture
to
assert
his
authority
finding
himself
deserted
by
many
of
the
nobles
he
concluded
a
treaty
with
his
lawful
sovereign
and
retired
to
his
own
province
which
by
agreement
he
was
allowed
to
retain
as
his
own
independent
state
tirumala
shortly
afterwards
strangled
the
king
and
seized
the
throne
the
nobles
submitted
since
he
was
of
royal
blood
and
better
in
their
opinion
than
rama
rajah
but
when
afterwards
they
found
themselves
unable
to
endure
his
tyranny
and
oppression
they
rebelled
and
invited
rama
rajah
to
return
tirumala
then
found
himself
in
great
straits
and
sent
ambassadors
with
large
presents
to
ibrahim
adil
shah
begging
him
to
march
to
his
assistance
and
promising
that
the
vijayanagar
kingdom
should
be
declared
tributary
to
bijapur
ibrahim
delighted
beyond
measure
after
consulting
asada
khan
accepted
the
terms
moved
from
his
capital
and
arrived
before
vijayanagar
in
the
year
which
corresponds
to
the
period
from
july
to
june
he
was
conducted
into
the
city
by
hoje
termul
roy
who
seated
him
on
the
musnud
of
the
raaje
and
made
rejoicings
for
seven
days
this
conduct
led
to
a
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
rama
rajah
and
his
supporters
they
entreated
tirumala
for
the
sake
of
the
country
to
procure
the
retreat
of
the
sultan
to
his
own
dominions
promising
submission
and
obedience
if
this
should
be
done
and
tirumala
thinking
that
now
he
had
no
further
use
for
his
allies
requested
the
sultan
to
return
home
he
paid
over
the
subsidy
agreed
upon
which
was
assessed
at
something
approaching
two
millions
sterling
and
made
many
other
gifts
the
story
then
ends
with
a
tragedy
ibrahim
adil
shaw
had
not
yet
recrossed
the
kistnah
when
ramraaje
and
the
confederates
who
had
bribed
many
of
the
troops
in
the
city
broke
their
newly
made
vows
and
hastened
towards
beejanuggur
resolved
to
put
the
roy
to
death
on
pretence
of
revenging
the
murder
of
his
predecessor
hoje
termul
roy
seeing
he
was
betrayed
shut
himself
up
in
the
palace
and
becoming
mad
from
despair
blinded
all
the
royal
elephants
and
horses
also
cutting
off
their
tails
that
they
might
be
of
no
use
to
his
enemy
all
the
diamonds
rubies
emeralds
other
precious
stones
and
pearls
which
had
been
collected
in
a
course
of
many
ages
he
crushed
to
powder
between
heavy
millstones
and
scattered
them
on
the
ground
he
then
fixed
a
into
a
pillar
of
his
apartment
and
ran
his
breast
upon
it
with
such
force
that
it
pierced
through
and
came
out
at
the
back
thus
putting
an
end
to
his
existence
just
as
the
gates
of
the
palace
were
opened
to
his
enemies
ramraaje
now
became
roy
of
beejanuggur
without
a
rival
after
this
point
in
firishtah
narrative
we
hear
of
no
more
young
roies
or
imprisoned
sovereigns
of
the
second
dynasty
ramraaje
alone
is
spoken
of
as
king
and
kings
achyuta
and
sadasiva
the
latter
of
whom
was
undoubtedly
recognised
as
king
for
some
years
though
he
was
kept
in
custody
are
not
so
much
as
mentioned
thus
firishtah
and
nuniz
both
agree
that
ibrahim
adil
advanced
as
far
as
the
city
of
vijayanagar
and
retired
after
payment
of
immense
sums
of
money
and
the
gift
of
many
valuable
presents
the
date
was
with
this
date
ends
the
historical
portion
of
the
chronicle
of
nuniz
we
continue
the
narrative
of
events
in
achyuta
reign
as
gathered
from
firishtah
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
death
of
hoje
tirumala
and
the
seizure
of
the
throne
by
ramraaje
ibrahim
adil
shah
sent
asada
khan
to
reduce
the
important
fortress
of
adoni
which
was
undisputedly
in
vijayanagar
territory
rama
rajah
despatched
his
younger
brother
venkatadri
to
its
relief
and
the
latter
hastened
thither
with
a
large
force
assud
khan
upon
his
approach
raised
the
siege
and
moved
towards
him
a
sharp
engagement
ensued
and
assud
khan
finding
that
he
was
likely
to
have
the
worst
of
the
action
from
the
vast
superiority
in
numbers
of
the
enemy
retreated
in
good
order
but
was
followed
fourteen
miles
by
the
victors
when
he
encamped
and
venkatadry
in
order
to
be
ready
to
harass
the
retreat
the
next
day
halted
in
full
security
at
a
distance
of
only
two
miles
from
him
assud
khan
who
had
ardently
wished
for
such
an
event
towards
the
dawn
of
day
with
four
thousand
chosen
horse
surprized
the
camp
of
venkatadry
whose
had
left
him
wholly
off
his
guard
against
such
a
manoeuvre
assud
khan
penetrated
to
his
tents
before
he
received
the
alarm
and
he
had
scarce
time
to
make
his
escape
leaving
his
treasures
family
and
elephants
to
the
mercy
of
the
victors
when
the
day
had
fully
cleared
up
venkatadry
collected
his
scattered
troops
and
drew
up
as
if
to
engage
but
seeing
assud
khan
resolute
to
maintain
his
advantage
and
fearing
for
the
personal
safety
of
his
wife
and
children
he
declined
hazarding
a
battle
and
retiring
some
miles
off
fixed
his
camp
from
whence
he
wrote
ramraaje
an
account
of
his
disaster
and
requested
reinforcements
to
enable
him
to
repair
it
ramraaje
immediately
sent
supplies
of
men
and
money
openly
declaring
his
intentions
of
carrying
on
the
war
but
privately
informed
his
brother
that
he
had
reason
to
imagine
that
ibrahim
adil
shaw
had
not
been
led
merely
of
his
own
will
to
besiege
oodnee
that
he
suspected
the
zemindars
of
that
quarter
had
invited
him
to
make
war
and
that
many
of
the
nobility
with
him
were
secretly
in
his
interest
therefore
he
thought
he
would
act
prudently
by
making
peace
with
the
mussulmauns

of

which
were
fomented
against

and
disturbances
however
arose
in

lasted
during

whole
of

course
of

year
king
achyuta
died
and
was
succeeded
nominally
by
sadasiva

reign
vijayanagar
was
practically
in
the
hands
of
rama

of

tirumala
and
venkatadri
firishtah
was
a
great
admirer
of
asada
khan
and
supported
him
in
all
that
he
did
asada
was
a
turk
who
beginning
life
under
the
simple
name
of
khusru
in
the
service
of
ismail
adil
shah
distinguished
himself
in
his
sovereign
defence
during
the
attack
on
bijapur
in
a
defence
celebrated
on
account
of
the
heroic
conduct
of
the
sultan
aunt
dilshad
agha
khusru
was
rewarded
by
ismail
with
the
title
of
asada
khan
a
name
which
he
bore
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
a
grant
of
the
jaghir
of
belgaum
he
rose
to
be
chief
minister
and
of
the
army
of
his
master
and
died
full
of
years
and
honours
in
the
portuguese
at
goa
had
a
very
low
opinion
of
asada
character
they
held
him
to
be
an
inveterate
intriguer
ready
at
every
moment
to
betray
his
best
friends
even
his
sovereign
if
only
by
so
doing
he
could
advance
his
own
personal
and
selfish
interests
and
in
this
owing
to
his
consummate
skill
and
tortuous
ways
he
invariably
succeeded
if
space
permitted
many
interesting
stories
could
be
narrated
of
him
culled
from
the
various
writings
of
the
day
barros
calls
him
sufo
larij
a
name
which
some
writers
have
derived
from
yusuf
of
lar
castanheda
spells
the
name
cufolarim
asada
khan
is
entitled
to
a
chapter
to
himself
but
to
avoid
prolixity
i
will
only
give
one
extract
from
the
asia
of
barros
allusion
has
been
made
above
to
an
attack
on
the
mainlands
of
goa
by
three
hindu
chiefs
when
ponda
was
besieged
the
inhabitants
appealed
to
nuno
da
cunha
the
who
hesitated
to
interfere
for
fear
of
bringing
on
a
war
with
the
adil
shah
the
principal
danger
was
the
lord
of
belgaum
asada
khan
acadachan
like
one
who
in
a
safe
and
lofty
place
watches
some
great
fire
spreading
over
the
plains
below
watched
from
his
city
of
belgaum
the
events
that
were
passing
but
did
nothing
till
the
adil
shah
wrote
desiring
him
to
return
to
bijapur
which
he
had
temporarily
left
owing
to
a
disagreement
and
to
assist
him
in
the
government
of
the
kingdom
asada
khan
replied
craftily
that
he
had
done
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
and
proposed
to
go
and
die
at
mecca
at
this
ismail
flew
into
a
passion
and
vowed
revenge
against
his
powerful
subject
who
to
save
himself
wrote
to
da
cunha
professing
his
unalloyed
friendship
for
the
portuguese
and
inviting
them
to
take
possession
of
certain
tracts
on
the
mainland
declaring
that
his
master
the
sultan
was
powerless
to
defend
himself
against
the
armies
of
vijayanagar
this
was
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
long
after
the
hindu
victory
at
raichur
da
cunha
sent
christovao
de
figueiredo
krishna
deva
valiant
friend
to
bear
his
reply
since
the
latter
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
lord
of
belgaum
a
conversation
took
place
in
which
asada
khan
said
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
master
who
was
of
variable
and
inconstant
character
and
that
he
desired
of
all
things
to
preserve
friendship
with
the
portuguese
he
therefore
begged
to
be
allowed
to
visit
goa
and
cement
an
alliance
with
the
to
whom
he
faithfully
promised
that
the
lands
in
question
should
become
for
ever
the
property
of
the
king
of
portugal
accordingly
the
lands
were
seized
by
da
cunha
immediately
afterwards
asada
began
to
intrigue
with
the
king
of
vijayanagar
and
being
invited
to
visit
that
city
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
the
great
mahanavami
festivals
left
belgaum
with
men
and
elephants
before
starting
he
wrote
to
da
cunha
asking
that
figueiredo
might
be
sent
to
accompany
him
and
promising
to
obtain
for
the
portuguese
a
definite
cession
of
the
lands
from
the
raya
since
these
had
formerly
been
the
latter
possession
accordingly
figueiredo
left
for
vijayanagar
but
learned
that
the
khan
had
already
arrived
there
and
had
joined
the
king
the
raya
received
asada
favourably
and
as
a
present
gave
him
two
towns
tunge
and
turugel
since
he
hoped
for
his
aid
against
the
sultan
when
the
sultan
heard
of
asada
khan
defection
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
but
assembled
an
army
and
advanced
to
within
twelve
leagues
of
the
king
camp
where
asada
khan
had
pitched
his
tents
at
some
distance
from
those
of
the
hindu
lords
the
sultan
thence
wrote
to
the
raya
demanding
the
delivery
to
him
of
his
recalcitrant
slave
and
the
raya
sent
on
the
letter
to
asada
khan
who
told
the
king
that
he
would
never
join
the
muhammadans
but
would
remain
faithful
to
vijayanagar
a
short
pause
ensued
during
which
the
raya
learned
that
constant
messages
were
passing
between
the
camps
of
the
sultan
and
asada
khan
both
armies
then
marched
towards
raichur
the
raya
to
retake
the
place
from
the
sultan
the
sultan
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
attack
the
raya
on
the
third
day
asada
khan
started
with
his
forces
two
hours
in
advance
of
the
royal
troops
crossed
the
river
first
and
hastened
to
join
the
sultan
adil
shah
received
him
with
great
apparent
cordiality
and
at
length
freely
forgave
him
on
the
khan
protestations
that
his
intrigues
with
vijayanagar
and
the
portuguese
were
only
so
many
moves
in
a
game
undertaken
for
the
advancement
of
the
interests
previous
to
this
move
the
khan
had
held
a
conversation
with
figueiredo
in
which
he
succeeded
in
totally
deceiving
him
as
to
his
intentions
and
reiterated
his
promises
to
obtain
the
cession
of
the
mainlands
from
the
raya
for
whom
he
professed
the
greatest
friendship
in
the
end
says
barros
the
adil
shah
secretly
fearful
of
asada
khan
duplicity
made
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
raya
by
which
the
muhammadans
retained
raichur
but
gave
up
some
other
territory
though
this
story
differs
from
firishtah
at
almost
every
point
it
is
permissible
to
think
that
it
may
refer
to
the
events
of
when
the
sultan
visited
vijayanagar
for
in
continuing
his
narrative
barros
a
little
later
mentions
the
year
it
seems
hopeless
to
try
and
reconcile
the
conflicting
stories
of
nuniz
barros
and
firishtah
but
enough
has
been
said
to
afford
insight
into
the
character
of
asada
khan
nuniz
echoes
the
general
sentiment
when
he
writes
of
the
rescue
of
the
adil
shah
after
his
defeat
at
raichur
in
as
being
effected
by
cunning
for
his
own
purposes
and
when
he
describes
how
by
a
series
of
lies
asada
contrived
the
execution
of
salabat
khan
at
the
hands
of
krishna
raya
during
this
reign
the
portuguese
were
busy
establishing
themselves
at
various
places
on
the
coast
and
they
built
several
forts
there
for
the
protection
of
their
trade
they
had
been
constantly
at
war
with
the
samuri
of
calicut
and
other
feudatories
of
vijayanagar
but
with
the
raya
himself
they
were
on
terms
of
friendship
and
in
they
ratified
a
treaty
of
peace
with
the
sovereigns
of
bijapur
and
ahmadnagar
as
well
as
with
the
samuri
throughout
the
whole
of
their
dealings
with
the
portuguese
i
find
not
a
single
instance
where
the
hindu
kings
broke
faith
with
the
intruders
but
as
much
can
not
i
fear
be
said
on
the
other
side
the
europeans
seemed
to
think
that
they
had
a
divine
right
to
the
pillage
robbery
and
massacre
of
the
natives
of
india
not
to
mince
matters
their
whole
record
is
one
of
a
series
of
atrocities
it
is
sad
to
turn
from
the
description
given
us
by
paes
of
the
friendship
felt
for
the
portuguese
and
especially
for
christovao
de
figueiredo
by
the
gallant
and
perfect
king
krishna
deva
and
then
to
read
of
the
treachery
of
the
viceroy
towards
the
great
hindu
government
with
which
the
portuguese
had
made
alliances
and
treaties
and
for
which
they
openly
professed
friendship
thus
to
take
one
instance
only
in
the
governor
of
goa
made
ready
a
large
fleet
and
a
force
of
men
but
kept
all
his
preparations
secret
for
very
good
reason
his
object
was
to
sail
round
the
coast
to
san
thome
near
madras
land
his
troops
march
inland
and
sack
the
great
temple
of
tirumala
or
tirupati
purely
for
lust
of
gain
luckily
a
severe
storm
prevented
him
from
setting
said
but
he
plundered
and
destroyed
some
rich
temples
on
the
western
coast
and
enriched
himself
with
the
spoil
this
was
a
mere
wanton
attack
on
property
belonging
to
feudatories
of
the
vijayanagar
empire
for
there
has
never
been
any
pretence
that
the
brahmans
attached
to
these
temples
had
in
any
way
offended
or
interfered
with
the
portuguese
in
the
time
of
achyuta
a
large
number
of
grants
were
made
by
the
nobles
to
temples
throughout
southern
india
and
numerous
inscriptions
on
stone
and
copperplates
are
extant
relating
to
these
charitable
and
religious
donations
one
of
the
most
important
has
been
published
by
professor
kielhorn
it
relates
that
the
king
being
on
the
banks
of
the
tungabhadra
on
the
october
at
the
temple
of
vitthalasvami
or
vitthalesvara
the
splendidly
sculptured
pavilions
of
which
remain
to
this
day
even
in
their
ruin
and
decay
an
object
of
astonishment
and
admiration
to
all
beholders
gave
a
grant
of
a
village
not
far
from
madras
to
the
brahmans
learned
in
the
vedas
the
last
date
of
achyuta
known
to
epigraphists
at
present
is
found
in
an
inscription
bearing
a
date
corresponding
to
january
and
the
earliest
date
similarly
available
of
his
successor
sadasiva

of
rama

and
his
two
brothers
tirumala
and
venkatadri
that
sadasiva
was
recognised
by
every
one
as
the
real
sovereign
is
shown
by
a
large
number
of
inscriptions
ranging
from
to
most
of
which
however
have
not
yet
been
properly
examined
a
careful
study
has
been
made
by
hultzsch
of
one
of
these
dated
in
a
year
or
so
after
the
great
defeat
of
the
hindus
at
talikota
and
the
destruction
of
the
capital
and
this
is
especially
interesting
as
it
bears
out
my
assertion
that
even
the
three
brothers
themselves
recognised
sadasiva
as
king
though
he
had
no
power
and
was
kept
under
constraint
in
this
document
rama
rajah
brother
tirumala
is
the
important
personage
but
he
submits
to
the
minor
title
mahamandalesvara
while
sadasiva
is
mentioned
as
sovereign
the
inscription
states
that
a
certain
person
presented
a
petition
to
the
mahamandalesvara
rama
raja
tirumala
raja
who
after
obtaining
sanction
at
the
feet
of
maharaya
granted
a
village
to
the
great
temple
at
vellore
rama
rajah
and
venkatadri
were
both
at
that
time
dead
and
tirumala
was
king
de
facto
couto
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
three
brothers
went
on
one
day
every
year
and
prostrated
themselves
before
their
lawful
sovereign
in
token
of
his
rights
over
them
but
as
to
the
read
relationship
of
achyuta
to
krishna
and
sadasiva
to
both
we
are
still
completely
in
doubt
we
saw
that
according
to
nuniz
krishna
deva
immediately
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
imprisoned
his
three
brothers
and
a
nephew
then
eight
years
old
son
of
the
late
king
busbalrao
this
was
in
the
year
and
krishna
was
then
over
twenty
years
old
we
hear
of
no
king
of
the
name
of
busbalrao
or
anything
like
it
from
other
sources
nor
are
the
names
of
krishna
three
brothers
as
given
by
nuniz
at
all
like
those
of
the
two
mentioned
in
some
of
the
inscriptions
more
than
one
epigraphical
record
contains
the
following
genealogy
here
we
have
two
of
krishna
deva
named
ranga
and
achyuta
the
latter
being
chosen
king
and
a
nephew
sadasiva
two
inscriptions
noted
in
my
sketch
of
the
dynasties
of
southern
india
state
that
achyuta
was
the
son
of
krishna
deva
while
a
telugu
work
the
manucharitram
makes
him
son
of
the
second
narasimha
couto
says
that
he
was
nephew
of
krishna
raya
as
to
sadasiva
some
authorities
make
him
as
stated
above
nephew
of
krishna
deva
and
son
of
ranga
while
another
says
that
he
was
the
son
of
achyuta
an
inscription
at
conjeeveram
states
that
achyuta
had
a
wife
named
varada
devi
who
bore
him
a
son
venkata
venkata
was
actually
raised
to
the
throne
but
lived
only
a
short
time
and
then
young
sadasiva
was
crowned
king
if
it
is
necessary
to
make
any
choice
amid
all
this
confusion
i
recommend
my
readers
to
accept
provisionally
the
pedigree
given
in
the
above
table
leaving
it
for
future
research
to
finally
settle
the
question
as
to
rama
raya
several
inscriptions
state
that
he
and
his
two
brothers
were
sons
of
one
ranga
raya
whose
pedigree
is
given
and
professor
kielhorn
considers
it
established
that
rama
married
krishna
deva
daughter
she
was
probably
a
child
at
her
marriage
she
had
a
brother
eighteen
months
old
at
the
time
of
krishna
deva
death
so
nuniz
says
but
we
hear
nothing
more
about
him
or
what
became
of
him
another
daughter
of
krishna
deva
raya
is
said
to
have
been
married
to
rama
raya
brother
tirumala
some
authorities
state
that
rama
wife
was
sadasiva
sister
that
there
were
disturbances
at
the
capital
on
the
death
of
achyuta
in
seems
clear
and
indeed
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
for
he
appears
to
have
dislocated
the
whole
empire
alienated
the
nobles
upon
whom
the
defence
of
the
country
rested
and
aroused
in
them
a
spirit
of
rebellion
to
the
crown
gaspar
correa
has
left
us
an
account
of
what
took
place
at
vijayanagar
at
that
time
and
i
repeat
his
story
for
what
it
is
worth
though
it
certainly
seems
as
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
brought
down
to
this
year
the
affairs
of
the
story
of
which
has
already
been
told
for
he
alludes
to
a
visit
of
the
adil
shah
to
vijayanagar
and
unless
there
were
two
such
visits
correa
would
seem
to
be
in
error
since
firishtah
date
is
confirmed
by
nuniz
in
whose
time
king
achyuta
was
alive
correa
states
that
in
achyuta
king
of
vijayanagar
died
leaving
a
young
son
in
the
power
of
his
uncle
brother
of
the
dead
king
who
had
been
king
contrary
to
right
the
nobles
wished
to
keep
the
boy
at
liberty
nominating
two
ministers
to
carry
on
the
government
but
the
uncle
disagreed
since
in
this
way
he
would
lose
all
power
and
he
contrived
to
gain
over
some
partisans
to
his
side
the
nobles
in
disgust
separated
returned
to
their
estates
and
in
despair
of
good
government
began
to
assume
independence
each
in
his
own
province
the
queen
mother
of
the
boy
begged
the
adil
shah
to
come
to
her
aid
and
secure
the
kingdom
for
her
son
promising
him
in
return
for
this
favour
immense
riches
the
sultan
set
out
for
this
purpose
intending
to
visit
vijayanagar
but
on
the
road
he
was
met
by
emissaries
from
the
minister
and
bought
off
with
lavish
gifts
the
king
by
real
right
probably
the
uncle
ranga
who
had
been
detained
in
a
fortress
was
then
liberated
and
he
also
sought
aid
from
the
sultan
of
bijapur
the
sultan
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
set
out
afresh
nominally
to
aid
the
true
king
but
really
to
acquire
the
kingdom
for
himself
the
hindus
in
fear
for
their
safety
placed
on
the
throne
the
brother
of
the
dead
king
and
succeeded
in
defeating
the
adil
shah
close
to
vijayanagar
the
new
king
in
order
to
strengthen
his
position
for
the
future
caused
the
boy
his
rival
to
be
assassinated
as
also
two
of
the
uncles
and
a
nephew
of
the
dead
king
achyuta
then
in
dread
of
the
power
of
the
principal
nobles
he
summoned
them
to
court
and
put
out
the
eyes
of
those
who
arrived
first
so
that
the
rest
returned
in
great
anger
to
their
homes
and
began
to
intrigue
with
the
sultan
they
urged
him
to
depose
the
tyrant
promising
their
aid
and
offering
him
the
kingdom
for
himself
if
only
the
country
could
be
freed
from
this
monster
the
adil
shah
therefore
advanced
entered
the
kingdom
of
vijayanagar
and
was
received
as
sovereign
by
many
but
he
also
assumed
such
intolerant
and
haughty
airs
that
he
aroused
the
hatred
of
all
around
him
and
in
the
end
was
obliged
in
fear
for
his
own
safety
to
retire
to
bijapur
meanwhile
a
new
king
had
seized
the
throne
of
vijayanagar
a
great
lord
from
paleacate
married
to
a
sister
of
the
king
that
preceded
the
dead
king
and
in
the
end
he
secured
the
kingdom
it
seems
impossible
as
senhor
lopes
justly
observes
to
get
at
the
truth
of
all
this
at
present
and
i
think
it
best
to
abandon
the
subject
and
pass
on
to
consider
the
events
of
the
reign
of
sadasiva
which
lasted
from
to
it
is
pretty
evident
that
each
chronicler
acquired
his
knowledge
from
stories
transmitted
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
disfigured
in
the
process
in
burhan
nizam
shah
made
an
alliance
with
rama
rajah
and
jamshid
qutb
shah
sultan
of
golkonda
and
attacked
the
adil
shah
whereupon
rama
rajah
taking
advantage
of
the
latter
troubles
sent
venkatadri
to
reduce
raichur
and
the
doab
so
that
beejapore
attacked
at
the
same
time
by
three
powerful
princes
in
three
separate
quarters
was
full
of
danger
and
disorder
true
to
the
traditions
of
his
predecessors
the
new
sultan
of
bijapur
called
assud
khan
from
balgoan
to
his
presence
and
demanded
his
advice
on
the
alarming
state
of
affairs
with
the
result
that
he
patched
up
a
peace
with
burhan
making
over
to
him
the
rich
districts
surrounding
sholapur
and
sent
ambassadors
to
arrange
terms
with
vijayanagar
this
done
and
the
allies
having
retired
asada
khan
marched
against
the
qutb
shah
of
golkonda
defeated
him
under
the
walls
of
his
capital
and
in
a
personal
encounter
grievously
wounded
him
in
the
face
with
his
sabre
the
portuguese
at
this
period
had
been
very
active
and
amongst
other
more
or
less
successful
enterprises
the
governor
affonso
de
sousa
attacked
the
territory
of
the
rani
of
bhatkal
on
the
pretext
that
she
had
withheld
tribute
due
to
the
king
of
portugal
and
wasted
her
country
with
fire
and
sword
her
city
was
burnt
the
hindus
were
slain
in
large
numbers
and
the
rani
reduced
to
submission
about
the
year
the
date
is
somewhat
uncertain
sultan
burhan
again
attacked
ibrahim
adil
at
the
instigation
of
rama
rajah
but
was
completely
defeated
the
sultan
ibrahim
after
this
victory
growing
haughty
and
imperious
treated
the
ambassadors
of
nizam
shah
in
a
contemptuous
manner
and
behaved
tyrannically
to
his
own
subjects
putting
to
death
many
and
severely
punishing
others
of
his
principal
nobility
for
slight
offences
which
occasioned
disaffection
to
his
government
on
burhan
again
invading
bijapur
territories
a
party
was
formed
to
depose
ibrahim
and
raise
to
the
throne
his
brother
abdullah
this
prince
finding
that
the
conspiracy
had
been
discovered
fled
for
safety
to
goa
where
he
was
well
received
but
when
ibrahim
promised
certain
provinces
to
the
portuguese
if
they
would
send
abdullah
away
to
a
place
where
he
could
no
longer
disturb
the
peace
of
the
bijapur
territories
de
sousa
accepted
the
conditions
receiving
the
gift
of
salsette
and
bardes
for
the
crown
of
portugal
and
the
whole
of
the
vast
treasures
accumulated
by
asada
khan
at
belgaum
as
a
personal
present
for
himself
having
pocketed
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
bribe
however
he
only
took
abdullah
as
far
as
cannanore
and
then
brought
him
back
to
goa
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
next
year
de
castro
succeeded
de
sousa
as
governor
the
former
refused
to
surrender
the
rebel
prince
this
duplicity
placed
the
sultan
in
great
difficulty
and
in
february
he
executed
a
treaty
of
peace
one
of
the
terms
of
which
was
that
no
person
belonging
either
to
the
dakhan
or
to
the
territories
of
the
nizam
shah
or
to
those
of
the
king
of
vijayanagar
with
certain
others
specially
mentioned
should
be
permitted
to
have
any
communication
with
abdullah
or
his
family
until
the
reply
of
the
king
of
portugal
was
received
to
an
embassy
which
the
adil
shah
proposed
to
send
to
him
there
were
other
terms
also
and
these
not
being
acted
up
to
by
the
portuguese
the
sultan
in
sent
some
troops
into
the
provinces
of
salsette
and
bardes
which
were
driven
out
by
the
viceroy
after
a
stubborn
fight
de
castro
then
concluded
treaties
with
vijayanagar
on
the
september
and
with
ahmadnagar
on
the
october
of
the
same
year
by
the
former
of
which
the
hindu
king
was
secured
in
the
monopoly
of
the
goa
horse
trade
and
by
the
latter
a
defensive
alliance
was
cemented
between
the
portuguese
and
the
nizam
shah
this
constituted
a
tripartite
league
against
bijapur
shortly
afterwards
a
still
more
determined
attack
was
made
by
the
bijapur
troops
against
the
mainlands
of
goa
and
in
the
battle
which
ensued
one
of
the
adil
shah
principal
generals
was
slain
in
the
viceroy
concluded
a
more
favourable
arrangement
with
bijapur
and
also
with
the
rani
of
bhatkal
the
portuguese
historians
say
that
de
sousa
and
asada
khan
both
joined
the
ranks
of
the
supporters
of
abdullah
and
that
asada
khan
promised
to
give
the
king
of
portugal
all
the
territories
of
the
konkan
on
the
downfall
of
ibrahim
but
the
viceroy
changed
his
mind
and
withdrew
while
asada
khans
death
put
a
stop
to
all
intrigues
in
that
quarter
firishtah
account
however
of
the
conduct
of
asada
at
this
period
totally
differs
as
do
his
dates
he
states
that
although
the
khan
was
much
distressed
at
his
master
neglect
his
coldness
towards
him
and
his
attitude
of
suspicion
yet
he
himself
was
consistently
loyal
in
his
actions
and
did
his
utmost
to
crush
the
conspiracy
as
to
the
portuguese
this
historian
avers
that
so
far
from
abjuring
the
cause
of
abdullah
they
actually
marched
with
that
prince
from
goa
towards
bijapur
supported
by
the
nizam
shah
and
even
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
belgaum
but
when
it
became
evident
that
asada
could
not
be
corrupted
the
nobles
of
bijapur
returned
to
their
allegiance
to
their
sovereign
and
the
alliance
broke
up
sultan
ibrahim
advanced
to
belgaum
in
february
but
on
the
road
heard
that
asada
had
died
firishtah
account
of
the
bijapur
sultan
conduct
when
he
arrived
at
belgaum
is
too
suggestive
to
be
omitted
the
king
he
says
comforted
his
asada
khan
mourning
family
with
khelauts
and
assurances
of
royal
favour
but
all
his
estates
and
treasures
he
took
for
his
own
use
though
these
treasures
were
the
accumulated
property
of
a
man
whom
the
historian
declares
to
have
been
during
the
whole
of
his
long
life
the
most
faithful
courageous
and
devoted
adherent
of
his
royal
master
whom
on
many
occasions
he
had
personally
rescued
from
difficulties
which
appeared
almost
insurmountable
the
portuguese
account
as
to
the
fate
of
the
treasures
accumulated
by
asada
khan
is
given
by
danvers
who
treating
the
khan
as
an
unprincipled
rebel
writes
in
addition
to
making
over
salsette
and
bardes
to
the
crown
of
portugal
the
adil
khan
had
also
given
martim
affonso
de
sousa
the
viceroy
the
vast
treasure
which
acede
khan
had
collected
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
his
rebellion
and
which
is
said
to
have
amounted
to
ten
millions
of
ducats
of
which
however
only
one
million
came
into
the
hands
of
martim
affonso
some
accounts
state
that
he
sent
about
half
of
this
amount
to
portugal
for
his
own
use
but
others
aver
that
he
employed
a
great
part
of
it
in
the
public
service
in
india
besides
sending
some
home
for
the
king
use
in
portugal
it
will
be
seen
that
the
two
accounts
differ
widely
in
details
at
this
time
ibrahim
qutb
shah
younger
brother
of
jamshid
and
heir
presumptive
to
the
throne
of
golkonda
was
at
vijayanagar
whither
he
had
fled
in
fear
of
jamshid
despotic
and
violent
temper
firishtah
relates
a
story
of
him
which
is
worth
repeating
here
partly
because
the
event
occurred
in
the
hindu
capital
partly
because
it
illustrates
the
practice
of
duelling
which
as
nuniz
tells
us
largely
obtained
at
that
time
and
partly
because
it
confirms
the
assertions
of
nuniz
that
the
king
of
vijayanagar
was
in
the
habit
of
disposing
at
will
with
the
revenues
of
his
provinces
rama
raya
had
despotically
turned
out
of
his
estate
an
abyssinian
officer
in
his
employ
named
ambur
khan
and
conferred
the
same
on
prince
ibrahim
for
his
support
ambur
khan
enraged
at
the
alienation
of
his
estate
and
meeting
ibrahim
kootb
shah
in
the
streets
of
beejanuggur
accused
him
of
depriving
him
of
it
the
latter
replied
that
monarchs
were
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
their
own
property
and
that
the
king
of
beejanuggur
had
chosen
to
give
him
the
estate
ibrahim
kootb
shah
proceeded
on
his
way
but
the
abyssinian
called
him
coward
in
refusing
to
dispute
his
title
with
the
sword
ibrahim
warned
him
of
his
imprudence
but
the
prince
mildness
only
added
fury
to
the
abyssinian
anger
who
proceeded
to
abuse
him
in
grosser
language
on
this
the
prince
dismounted
and
drew
the
abyssinian
rushed
upon
him
but
the
temper
giving
him
the
advantage
he
killed
his
antagonist
whose
brother
standing
by
insisted
on
taking
up
the
cause
and
he
also
fell
a
victim
to
his
temerity
prince
ibrahim
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
golkonda
in
in
the
previous
year
says
firishtah
an
alliance
was
cemented
between
sultan
ibrahim
of
bijapur
and
the
new
sovereign
of
bidar
ali
barid
son
of
amir
barid
rama
rajah
having
at
this
period
accepted
the
presents
and
professions
of
regard
sent
to
him
by
the
nizam
shah
with
an
embassy
sultan
ibrahim
roused
to
indignation
treated
the
vijayanagar
ambassadors
at
bijapur
with
such
indignity
that
they
fled
in
fear
of
their
lives
and
rama
rajah
offended
in
his
turn
induced
burhan
nizam
to
attack
ibrahim
he
did
so
successfully
and
captured
the
fortress
of
kallian
and
on
ibrahim
retaliating
by
seizing
one
of
the
ahmadnagar
forts
an
open
alliance
was
entered
into
between
burhan
and
rama
the
two
kings
met
near
raichur
in
laid
siege
to
the
place
and
took
it
mudkul
also
capitulated
and
the
doab
was
thus
once
more
restored
to
the
hindu
sovereign
about
this
time
so
we
are
told
by
a
muhammadan
historian
rama
raya
two
brothers
rebelled
against
his
authority
during
his
absence
from
the
capital
and
seized
the
fortress
of
adoni
upon
which
rama
begged
aid
from
the
qutb
shah
ibrahim
and
this
being
granted
rama
besieged
adoni
for
six
months
the
place
eventually
capitulated
and
the
brothers
were
then
pardoned
in
burhan
died
and
once
more
the
two
leading
muhammadan
states
became
friendly
for
a
short
time
but
the
air
was
too
full
of
intrigue
and
jealousy
for
this
to
last
long
sultan
ibrahim
negotiated
an
understanding
with
vijayanagar
and
this
led
to
a
renewal
of
the
war
in
the
course
of
which
a
battle
took
place
at
sholapur
where
ibrahim
was
worsted
but
the
most
serious
reverse
which
he
suffered
was
at
the
hands
of
a
chief
named
whom
by
ingratitude
and
he
had
driven
into
open
rebellion
at
the
end
of
a
short
campaign
against
this
person
the
royal
troops
were
completely
beaten
and
the
sultan
was
driven
to
take
refuge
at
bijapur
in
a
state
of
desperation
he
called
on
the
raya
of
vijayanagar
for
aid
and
rama
as
usual
representing
the
puppet
sovereign
sent
his
brother
venkatadri
with
a
large
force
to
expel
the
enemy
from
the
sultan
dominions
the
story
of
the
rebel
discomfiture
at
the
hands
of
venkatadri
is
thus
told
by
firishtah
syef
ein
al
moolkh
imitating
assud
khan
resolved
to
surprize
the
infidels
but
venkatadry
having
intelligence
of
his
designs
ordered
his
troops
to
be
on
their
guard
and
having
procured
long
faggots
with
cloth
steeped
in
oil
bound
round
one
end
of
each
commanded
his
followers
upon
the
alarm
being
given
to
light
them
and
holding
them
up
as
high
as
possible
give
the
troops
a
full
sight
of
the
enemy
ein
al
moolk
agreeably
to
his
intentions
having
one
night
chosen
two
thousand
men
for
the
purpose
marched
with
sullabut
khan
to
the
enemy
camp
which
he
was
allowed
to
enter
unmolested
but
upon
a
signal
given
all
the
brands
were
instantly
lighted
up
and
venkatadry
who
was
prepared
with
his
troops
rushed
upon
the
surprizers
who
expected
no
resistance
with
such
success
that
above
five
hundred
of
them
were
killed
before
the
detachment
could
clear
the
camp
ein
al

and
sullabut
with
the
greatest
difficulty
made
their
escape
but
losing
the
road
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
report
spread
in
his
camp
on
the
return
of
some
of
the
fugitives
that
he
was
killed
and
his
troops
being
immediately
struck
with
a
panic
separated
and
fled
to
different
quarters
ein
al

and
sullabut
khan
with
two
hundred
horse
about
daylight
arriving
at
their
ground
and
seeing
it
deserted
fled
in
confusion
by
the
route
of
maan
to
the
dominions
of
nizam
shaw
where
they
sought
protection
but
were
basely
assassinated
by
his
treachery
in
an
attempt

made
by
the
portuguese
under
their
new
viceroy
pedro
de
mascarenhas
to
place
prince
abdullah
on
the
throne
of
bijapur
the
foreigners
being
dazzled
by
the
magnificent
offers
made
to
them
should
the
joint
efforts
of
the
conspirators
be
crowned
with
success
abdullah
was
established
at
ponda
and
proclamation
made
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
on
the
death
of
de
mascarenhas
in
francisco
barreto
succeeded
him
with
the
title
of
governor
and
having
installed
the
prince
at
ponda
he
proceeded
to
collect
the
revenues
of
the
country
he
was
however
opposed
by
an
officer
of
ibrahim
adil
who
was
backed
by
seven
thousand
troops
and
several
fights
took
place
meanwhile
ibrahim
himself
had
not
been
idle
and
aided
by
fifteen
thousand
of
sadasiva
troops
from
vijayanagar
he
dethroned
and
captured
the
ambitious
prince
following
this
up
by
several
attacks
on
the
portuguese
forces
the
war
lasted
during
the
whole
winter

with
no
very
decisive
results
next
year
a
fresh
relay
of
troops
from
bijapur
attacked
salsette
and
bardes
but
were
beaten
by
a
small
force
of
portuguese
near
ponda
and
hostilities
were
suspended
for
a
time
shortly
after
this
in
sultan
ibrahim
died
during
his
illness
he
put
to
death
several
physicians
who
had
failed
in
cure
beheading
some
and
causing
others
to
be
trodden
to
death
by
elephants
so
that
all
the
surviving
medical
practitioners
alarmed
fled
from
his
dominions
he
was
succeeded
by
his
eldest
son
ali
adil
the
new
sultan
immediately
on
his
accession
cemented
his
alliance
with
sadasiva
and
rama
rajah
by
the
execution
of
a
new
treaty
and
sent
ambassadors
on
a
similar
errand
to
husain
nizam
shah
the
successor
of
burhan
at
ahmadnagar
these
however
were
badly
received
and
sultan
ali
whose
envoys
at
the
hindu
capital
had
been
warmly
welcomed
and
hospitably
treated
determined
to
establish
if
possible
a
real
and
lasting
friendship
with
vijayanagar
to
this
end
he
adopted
a
most
unusual
course
the
account
of
which
will
be
best
given
in
firishtah
own
words
ali
adil
shaw
who
was
intent
on
extricating
his
dominions
from
the
losses
of
his
father
by
alliance
with
ramraaje
on
the
death
of
a
son
of
that
monarch
with
uncommon
prudence
and
resolution
went
attended
by
one
hundred
horse
to
beejanuggur
to
offer
his
condolence
on
the
melancholy
occasion
ramraaje
received
him
with
the
greatest
respect
and
the
sultan
with
the
kindest
persuasions
prevailed
upon
him
to
lay
aside
his
mourning
the
wife
of
ramraaje
adopted
the
sultan
as
her
son
and
at
the
end
of
three
days
which
were
spent
in
interchanges
of
friendly
professions
he
took
his
leave
but
as
ramraaje
did
not
attend
him
out
of
the
city
he
was
disgusted
and
treasured
up
the
affront
in
his
mind
though
too
prudent
to
show
any
signs
of
displeasure
for
the
present
the
incident
thus
entirely
failed
in
its
intended
effect
it
produced
a
lasting
irritation
in
the
mind
of
the
sultan
and
a
haughty
arrogance
on
the
part
of
rama
raya
who
conceived
that
the
fortunes
of
his
hereditary
enemy
must
be
at
a
very
low
ebb
when
he
could
condescend
so
far
to
humble
himself
in
the
next
year
according
to
couto
rama
raya
made
an
expedition
to
meliapor
or
mailapur
near
madras
where
was
an
important
establishment
of
roman
catholic
monks
and
the
church
of
thomas
i
quote
the
passage
from
the
summary
given
by
senhor
lopes
in
his
introduction
to
the
chronica
dos
reis
de
bisnaga
p
the
poor
fathers
of
the
glorious
order
of
francis
having
seized
all
the
coast
from
negapatam
to
san
thome
they
being
the
first
who
had
begun
to
preach
there
the
light
of
the
holy
gospel
and
having
throughout
that
tract
thrown
down
many
temples
and
destroyed
many
pagodas
a
thing
which
grieved
excessively
all
the
brahmans
these
latter
reported
the
facts
to
rama
raya
king
of
bisnaga
whose
vassals
they
were
and
begged
him
that
he
would
hasten
to
their
assistance
for
the
honour
of
their
gods
they
succeeded
in
persuading
him
that
the
newcomers
were
possessed
of
enormous
riches
and
he
proceeded
against
the
place
but
afterwards
finding
that
this
was
not
true
and
that
the
inhabitants
were
loyal
to
him
he
spared
them
and
left
them
in
peace
on
his
return
to
bijapur
ali
adil
peremptorily
demanded
from
hussain
nizam
shah
the
restoration
of
the
fortresses
of
kallian
and
sholapur
and
on
the
latter
contemptuous
refusal
he
sent
back
a
reply
so
indecent
in
expression
as
to
be
unfit
to
relate
says
firishtah
another
war
broke
out
in
the
year
october
to
october
ali
adil
shaw
having
called
ramraaje
to
his
assistance
they
in
concert
divided
the
dominions
of
houssein
nizam
shaw
and
laid
them
waste
in
such
a
manner
that
from
porundeh
to
khiber
and
from
ahmednuggur
to
dowlutabad
not
a
mark
of
population
was
to
be
seen
the
infidels
of
beejanuggur
who
for
many
years
had
been
wishing
for
such
an
event
left
no
cruelty
unpractised
they
insulted
the
honour
of
the
mussulmaun
women
destroyed
the
mosques
and
did
not
even
respect
the
sacred
koraun
this
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
hindus
so
incensed
the
followers
of
islam
not
only
the
hostile
subjects
of
golkonda
but
even
the
allied
troops
and
inhabitants
of
the
bijapur
territories
that
it
laid
the
foundation
for
the
final
downfall
and
destruction
of
vijayanagar
in
dom
constantine
de
braganza
became
viceroy
of
goa
and
his
period
of
government
was
signalised
by
every
kind
of
violence
and
aggression
in
luiz

mello
carried
fire
and
sword
into
the
towns
along
the
malabar
coast
he
attacked
mangalore
set
fire
to
the
town
and
put
all
the
inhabitants
to
death
later
in
the
year
he
destroyed
in
similar
manner
a
number
of
towns
and
villages
on
the
same
coast
and
desolated
the
whole

the
inhabitants
of
goa
and
its
dependencies
were
now
forced
to
embrace
christianity
and
on
refusal
or
contumacy
were
imprisoned
and
tortured
in
this
year
also
and
those
following
the
predatory
excursions
of
the
portuguese

in

case
of
hundreds
of
others
sewed
them
up
in
sails
and
threw
them
overboard
in
these
ways
he
massacred
men
this
resulted
in
a
serious
war
in
malabar
as
the
wretched
inhabitants
of
the
country
driven
to
desperation
determined
at
all
hazards
to
destroy

ruthless

of

meanwhile
affairs
were
advancing
rapidly
in
the
interior
after
the
nizam
shah
dominions
had
been
wasted
as
already
described
by
the
adil
shah
and
rama
raya
peace
was
made
by
the
restoration
of
kallian
to
bijapur
but
as
soon
as
the
allies
had
retired
hussain
entered
into
an
alliance
with
ibrahim
qutb
shah
and
again
marched
to
attack

called
in
the
aid

and

marched
to
his
aid

with

and
an
immense
force
of
infantry
the
opposing
forces
met
at
kallian
when
the
qutb
shah
deserted
to
ali
adil
and
hussain
was
compelled
to
withdraw
to
ahmadnagar
attacked
in
his
own
capital
he
retreated
the
three
sovereigns
laid
siege
to
ahmednuggur
and
despatched
detachments
various
ways
to
lay
waste
the
country
round
the
hindoos
of
beejanuggur
committed
the
most
outrageous
devastations
burning
and
razing
the
buildings
putting
up
their
horses
in
the
mosques
and
performing
their
idolatrous
worship
in
the
holy
places
but
notwithstanding
the
siege
was
pushed
with
the
greatest
vigour
the
garrison
held
out
with
resolution
hoping
that
at
the
approach
of
the
rainy
season
the
enemy
would
be
necessitated
to
raise
the
siege
when
the
rains
had
set
in
from
the
floods
damp
and
want
of
provisions
distress
began
to
prevail
in
the
camp
of
the
allies
and
kootub
shaw
also
secretly
corresponded
with
the
besieged
to
whom
he
privately
sent
in
grain
the
siege
was
raised
therefore
and
before
long
the
allies
separated
and
the
hindu
army
returned
home
in
the
first
expedition
on
which
ali
adil
shaw
pressed
by
the
behaviour
of
houssein
nizam
shaw
had
called
ramraaje
to
his
assistance
the
hindoos
at
ahmednuggur
committed
great
outrages
and
omitted
no
mark
of
disrespect
to
the
holy
religion
of
the
faithful
singing
and
performing
their
superstitious
worship
in
the
mosques
the
sultan
was
much
hurt
at
this
insult
to
the
faith
but
as
he
had
not
the
ability
to
prevent
it
he
did
not
seem
to
observe
it
ramraaje
also
at
the
conclusion
of
this
expedition
looking
on
the
islaam
sultans
as
of
little
consequence
refused
proper
honours
to
their
ambassadors
when
he
admitted
them
to
his
presence
he
did
not
suffer
them
to
sit
and
treated
them
with
the
most
contemptuous
reserve
and
haughtiness
he
made
them
attend
when
in
publick
in
his
train
on
foot
not
allowing
them
to
mount
till
he
gave
orders
on
the
return
from
the
last
expedition
to
nuldirruk
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
his
army
in
general
treated
the
mussulmauns
with
insolence
scoffing
and
contemptuous
language
and
ramraaje
after
taking
leave
casting
an
eye
of
avidity
on
the
countries
of
koottub
shaw
and
adil
shaw
dispatched
armies
to
the
frontiers
of
each
both
the
great
shahs
therefore
abandoned
certain
territories
to
the
hindus
and
from
golkonda
rama
obtained
ghanpura
and
pangul
it
was
the
last
hindu
success
ramraaje
daily
continuing
to
encroach
on
the
dominions
of
the
mussulmauns
adil
shaw
at
length
resolved
if
possible
to
punish
his
insolence
and
curtail
his
power
by
a
general
league
of
the
faithful
against
him
for
which
purpose
he
convened
an
assembly
of
his
friends
and
confidential
advisers
some
of
these
urged
that
the
raya
was
too
wealthy
and
powerful
by
reason
of
his
immense
revenues
which
were
collected
from
no
less
than
sixty
seaports
in
addition
to
very
large
territories
and
dependencies
and
the
number
of
his
forces
was
too
vast
for
any
single
muhammadan
monarch
to
cope
with
him
they
therefore
pressed
the
sultan
to
form
a
federation
of
all
the
kings
of
the
dakhan
and
wage
a
joint
war
ali
adil
heartily
concurred
in
their
opinion
and
began
by
despatching
a
secret
embassy
to
ibrahim
qutb
shah
ibrahim
eagerly
accepted
and
offered
his
services
as
mediator
between
ali
adil
and
his
great
rival
at
ahmadnagar
an
envoy
was
sent
to
the
latter
capital
and
the
sovereign
hussain
shah
warned
beforehand
of
the
important
proposals
to
be
made
received
him
in
private
audience
the
ambassador
then
laid
before
the
king
all
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
bijapur
plan
he
represented
to
him
that
during
the
times
of
the
bhamenee
princes
when
the
whole
strength
of
the
mussulmaun
power
was
in
one
hand
the
balance
between
it
and
the
force
of
the
roles
of
beejanuggur
was
nearly
equal
that
now
the
mussulmaun
authority
was
divided
policy
demanded
that
all
the
faithful
princes
should
unite
as
one
and
observe
the
strictest
friendship
that
they
might
continue
secure
from
the
attacks
of
their
powerful
common
enemy
and
the
authority
of
the
roles
of
beejanuggur
who
had
reduced
all
the
rajas
of
carnatic
to
their
yoke
be
diminished
and
removed
far
from
the
countries
of
islaam
that
the
people
of
their
several
dominions
who
ought
to
be
considered
the
charge
of
the
almighty
committed
to
their
care
might
repose
free
from
the
oppressions
of
the
unbelievers
and
their
mosques
and
holy
places
be
made
no
longer
the
dwellings
of
infidels
these
arguments
had
their
full
weight
and
it
was
arranged
that
hussain
nizam
shah
should
give
his
daughter
chand
bibi
in
marriage
to
ali
adil
with
the
fortress
of
sholapur
as
her
dot
and
that
his
eldest
son
murtiza
should
espouse
ali
sister
the
two
kingdoms
coalescing
for
the
conquest
and
destruction
of
vijayanagar
the
marriages
were
celebrated
in
due
course
and
the
sultans
began
their
preparations
for
the
holy
war
ali
adil
shaw
preparatory
to
the
war
and
to
afford
himself
a
pretence
for
breaking
with
his
ally
dispatched
an
ambassador
to
ramraaje
demanding
restitution
of
some
districts
that
had
been
wrested
from
him
as
he
expected
ramraaje
expelled
the
ambassador
in
a
very
disgraceful
manner
from
his
court
and
the
united
sultans
now
hastened
the
preparations
to
crush
the
common
enemy
of
the
islaam
faith
ibrahim
qutb
shah
had
also
joined
the
coalition
and
the
four
princes
met
on
the
plains
of
bijapur
with
their
respective
armies
their
march
towards
the
south
began
on
monday
december
traversing
the
now
dry
plains
of
the
dakhan
country
where
the
cavalry
numbering
many
thousands
could
graze
their
horses
on
the
young
crops
the
allied
armies
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
the
krishna
near
the
small
fortress
and
town
of
talikota
a
name
destined
to
be
for
ever
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
south
india
it
is
situated
on
the
river
don
about
sixteen
miles
above
its
junction
with
the
krishna
and
miles
west
of
the
point
where
the
present
railway
between
bombay
and
madras
crosses
the
great
river
the
country
at
that
time
of
the
year
was
admirably
adapted
for
the
passage
of
large
bodies
of
troops
and
the
season
was
one
of
bright
sunny
days
coupled
with
cool
refreshing
breezes
here
ali
adil
as
lord
of
that
country
entertained
his
allies
in
royal
fashion
and
they
halted
for
several
days
attending
to
the
transport
and
commissariat
arrangements
of
the
armies
and
sending
out
scouts
to
report
on
the
best
locality
for
forcing
the
passage
of
the
river
at
vijayanagar
there
was
the
utmost
confidence
remembering
how
often
the
moslems
had
vainly
attempted
to
injure
the
great
capital
and
how
for
over
two
centuries
they
had
never
succeeded
in
penetrating
to
the
south
the
inhabitants
pursued
their
daily
avocations
with
no
shadow
of
dread
or
sense
of
danger
the
strings
of
laden
with
all
kinds
of
merchandise
wended
their
dusty
way
to
and
from
the
several
seaports
as
if
no
sword
of
damocles
was
hanging
over
the
doomed
city
sadasiva
the
king
lived
his
profitless
life
in
inglorious
seclusion
and
rama
raya
king
de
facto
never
for
a
moment
relaxed
his
attitude
of
haughty
indifference
to
the
movements
of
his
enemies
he
treated
their
ambassadors
says
firishtah
with
scornful
language
and
regarded
their
enmity
as
of
little
moment
nevertheless
he
did
not
neglect
common
precautions
his
first
action
was
to
send
his
youngest
brother
tirumala
the
yeltumraj
or
eeltumraaje
of
firishtah
to
the
front
with
horse
foot
and
elephants
to
block
the
passage
of
the
krishna
at
all
points
next
he
despatched
his
second
brother
venkatadri
with
another
large
army
and
finally
marched
in
person
towards
the
point
of
attack
with
the
whole
power
of
the
vijayanagar
empire
the
forces
were
made
up
of
large
drafts
from
all
the
provinces
canarese
and
telugus
of
the
frontier
mysoreans
and
malabarese
from
the
west
and
centre
mixed
with
the
tamils
from
the
remoter
districts
to
the
south
each
detachment
under
its
own
local
leaders
and
forming
part
of
the
levies
of
the
temporary
provincial
chieftain
appointed
by
the
crown
according
to
couto
they
numbered
foot
and
horse
his
adversaries
had
about
half
that
number
as
to
their
appearance
and
armament
we
may
turn
for
information
to
the
description
given
us
by
paes
of
the
great
review
of
which
he
was
an
years
earlier
at
vijayanagar
remembering
always
that
the
splendid
troops
between
whose
lines
he
then
passed
in
the
king
procession
were
probably
the
elite
of
the
army
and
that
the
common
soldiers
were
clad
in
the
lightest
of
working
clothes
many
perhaps
with
hardly
any
clothes
at
all
and
armed
only
with
spear
or
dagger
the
allies
had
perhaps
halted
too
long
at
any
rate
their
scouts
returned
to
their
sovereigns
with
the
news
that
all
the
passages
of
the
river
were
defended
and
that
their
only
course
was
to
force
the
ford
immediately
in
their
front
this
was
in
possession
of
the
hindus
who
had
fortified
the
banks
on
the
south
side
had
thrown
up
earthworks
and
had
stationed
a
number
of
cannon
to
dispute
the
crossing
the
defenders
of
the
ford
anxiously
awaited
intelligence
of
their
enemy
movements
and
learning
that
he
had
struck
his
camp
and
marched
along
the
course
of
the
river
they
quitted
their
post
and
followed
keeping
always
to
the
south
bank
in
readiness
to
repel
any
attempt
to
cross
directly
in
their
front
this
manoeuvre
a
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
mussulmans
was
repeated
on
three
successive
days
on
the
third
night
the
sultans
hastily
left
their
camp
returned
to
the
ford
and
finding
it
deserted
crossed
with
a
large
force
this
movement
covered
the
transit
of
the
whole
of
their
army
and
enabled
them
to
march
southwards
to
the
attack
of
rama
raya
main
body
rama
raya
though
surprised
was
not
alarmed
and
took
all
possible
measures
for
defence
in
the
morning
the
enemy
was
within
ten
miles
of
his
camp
and
venkatadri
and
tirumala
succeeded
in
effecting
a
junction
with
their
brother
on
the
following
day
tuesday
january
both
sides
having
made
their
dispositions
a
pitched
battle
took
place
in
which
all
the
available
forces
of
both
sides
were
engaged
in
one
of
his
descriptions
firishtah
estimates
the
vijayanagar
army
alone
as
amounting
to
infantry
cavalry
and
elephants
besides
auxiliaries
but
he
himself
varies
so
greatly
in
the
numbers
he
gives
in
different
parts
of
his
narrative
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
accept
these
figures
as
accurate
there
can
be
little
doubt
however
that
the
numbers
were
very
large
the
hindu
left
on
the
west
was
entrusted
to
the
command
of
tirumala
rama
raya
in

was
in
the
centre
and
the
right
was
composed
of
the
troops
of
venkatadri
opposed
to
tirumala
were
the
forces
of
bijapur
under
their
sultan
ali
adil
the
mussalman
centre
was
under
the
command
of
hussain
nizam
shah
and
the
left
of
the
allied
army
in
front
consisted
of
the
forces
brought
from
ahmadabad
and
golkonda
by
the
two
sultans
ali
barid
and
ibrahim
qutb
the
allied
forces
drew
up
in
a
long
line
with
their
artillery
in
the
centre
and
awaited
the
enemy
attack
each
division
with
the
standards
of
the
twelve
imams
waving
in
the
van
the
nizam
shah
front
was
covered
by
six
hundred
pieces
of
ordnance
disposed
in
three
lines
in
the
first
of
which
were
heavy
guns
then
the
smaller
ones
with
light
swivel
guns
in
the
rear
in
order
to
mask
this
disposition
two
thousand
foreign
archers
were
thrown
out
in
front
who
kept
up
a
heavy
discharge
as
the
enemy
line
came
on
the
archers
fell
back
as
the
hindus
of
division
approached
and
the
batteries
opened
with
such
murderous
effect
that
the
assailants
retreated
in
confusion
and
with
great
loss
rama
rajah
was
now
a
very
old
man
couto
says
he
was
years
old
but
as
brave
as
a
man
of
thirty
and
against
the
entreaties
of
his
officers
he
preferred
to
superintend
operations
from
a
litter
rather
than
remain
for
a
long
time
mounted
a
dangerous
proceeding
since
in
case
of
a
reverse
a
rapid
retreat
was
rendered
impossible
but
he
could
not
be
induced
to
change
his
mind
remarking
that
in
spite
of
their
brave
show
the
enemy
were
children
and
would
soon
be
put
to
flight
so
confident
was
he
of
victory
that
it
is
said
he
had
ordered
his
men
to
bring
him
the
head
of
hussain
nizam
but
to
capture
the
adil
shah
and
ibrahim
of
golkonda
alive
that
he
might
keep
them
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
iron
cages
the
battle
becoming
more
general
the
hindus
opened
a
desolating
fire
from
a
number
of
and
the
left
and
right
of
the
muhammadan
line
were
pressed
back
after
destructive
fighting
many
falling
on
both
sides
at
this
juncture
rama
raya
thinking
to
encourage
his
men
descended
from
his
litter
and
seated
himself
on
a
rich
throne
set
with
jewels
under
a
canopy
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
and
adorned
with
fringes
of
pearls
ordering
his
treasurer
to
place
heaps
of
money
all
round
him
so
that
he
might
confer
rewards
on
such
of
his
followers
as
deserved
his
attention
there
were
also
ornaments
of
gold
and
jewels
placed
for
the
same
purpose
a
second
attack
by
the
hindus
on
the
guns
in
the
centre
seemed
likely
to
complete
the
overthrow
of
the
whole
muhammadan
line
when
the
front
rank
of
pieces
was
fired
at
close
quarters
charged
with
bags
of
copper
money
and
this
proved
so
destructive
that
hindus
were
left
dead
on
the
field
in
front
of
the
batteries
this
vigorous
policy
threw
the
hindu
centre
into
confusion
upon
which
muhammadan
cavalry
charged
through
the
intervals
of
the
guns
and
cut
their
way
into
the
midst
of
the
disorganised
masses
towards
the
spot
where
the
raya
had
taken
post
he
had
again
changed
his
position
and
ascended
his
litter
but
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
an
elephant
belonging
to
the
nizam
shah
wild
with
the
excitement
of
the
battle
dashed
forward
towards
him
and
the
let
fall
their
precious
burden
in
terror
at
the
animal
approach
before
he
had
time
to
recover
himself
and
mount
a
horse
a
body
of
the
allies
was
upon
him
and
he
was
seized
and
taken
prisoner
this
event
threw
the
hindus
into
a
panic
and
they
began
to
give
way
rama

was
conducted
by
the
officer
who
commanded
the
artillery
of
hussain
nizam
to
his
sultan
who
immediately
ordered
his
captive
to
be
decapitated
and
the
head
to
be
elevated
on
a
long
spear
so
that
it
might
be
visible
to
the
hindu
troops
on
seeing
that
their
chief
was
dead
the
vijayanagar
forces
broke
and
fled
they
were
pursued
by
the
allies
with
such
successful
slaughter
that
the
river
which
ran
near
the
field
was
dyed
red
with
their
blood
it
is
computed
on
the
best
authorities
that
above
one
hundred
thousand
infidels
were
slain
in
fight
and
during
the
pursuit
the
mussulmans
were
thus
completely
victorious
and
the
hindus
fled
towards
the
capital
but
so
great
was
the
confusion
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
made
to
take
up
a
new
and
defensive
position
amongst
the
hills
surrounding
the
city
or
even
to
defend
the
walls
or
the
approaches
the
rout
was
complete
the
plunder
was
so
great
that
every
private
man
in
the
allied
army
became
rich
in
gold
jewels
effects
tents
arms
horses
and

greatly
distressed
at

death
the
story
of
this
terrible
disaster
travelled
apace
to
the
city
of
vijayanagar
the
inhabitants
unconscious
of
danger
were
living
in
utter
ignorance
that
any
serious
reverse
had
taken
place
for
their
leaders
had
marched
out
with
countless
numbers
in
their
train
and
had
been
full
of
confidence
as
to
the
result
suddenly
however
came
the
bad
news
the
army
was
defeated
the
chiefs
slain
the
troops
in
retreat
but
still
they
did
not
grasp
the
magnitude
of
the
reverse
on

previous
occasions
the
enemy
had
been
either
driven
back
or
bought
off
with
presents
from
the
overstocked
treasury
of
the
kings
there
was
little
fear
therefore
for
the
city
itself
that
surely
was
safe
but
now
came
the
dejected
soldiers
hurrying
back
from
the
fight
and
amongst
the
foremost
the
princes
of
the
royal
house
within

hastily
left

this
was
not

it
was
a
cataclysm

my
sketch
of
vijayanagar
history
might
well
end
but
i
have
thought
it
advisable
to
add
a
few
notes
on
succeeding
events
tirumala
took
up
his
abode
at
penukonda
and
shortly
afterwards
sent
word
to
the
portuguese
traders
at
goa
that
he
was
in
need
of
horses
a
large
number
were
accordingly
delivered
when
the
despotic
ruler
dismissed
the
men
to
return
to
goa
as
best
they
could
without
payment
he
licensed
the
merchants
to
depart
writes
federici
without
giving
them
anything
for
their
horses
which
when
the
poore
men
saw
they
were
desperate
and
as
it
were
mad
with
sorrow
and
griefe
there
was
no
authority
left
in
the
land
and
the
traveller
had
to
stay
in
vijayanagar
seven
months
for
it
was
necessarie
to
rest
there
until
the
wayes
were
clear
of
theeves
which
at
that
time
ranged
up
and
downe
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
his
way
to
goa
at
all
for
he
and
his
companions
were
constantly
seized
by
sets
of
marauders
and
made
to
pay
heavy
ransom
for
their
liberty
and
on
one
occasion
they
were
attacked
by
dacoits
and
robbed
tirumala
being
now
with
king
sadasiva
in
penukonda
the
nobles
of
the
empire
began
to
throw
off
their
allegiance
and
one
after
another
to
proclaim
their
independence
the
country
was
in
a
state
of
anarchy
the
empire
just
now
so
solid
and
compact
became
disintegrated
and
from
this
time
forward
it
fell
rapidly
to
decay
to
the
portuguese
the
change
was
of
vital
importance
federici
has
left
us
the
following
note
on
their
trade
with
vijayanagar
which
i
extract
from
purchas
pilgrims
the
merchandize
that
went
every
yeere
from
goa
to
bezeneger
were
arabian
horses
velvets
damaskes
and
sattens
armesine
of
portugall
and
pieces
of
china
saffron
and
scarletts
and
from
bezeneger
they
had
in
turkie
for
their
commodities
jewels
and
pagodas
which
be
ducats
of
gold
the
apparell
that
they
use
in
bezeneger
is
velvet
satten
damaske
scarlet
or
white
bumbast
cloth
according
to
the
estate
of
the
person
with
long
hats
on
their
heads
called
colae
sassetti
who
was
in
india
from
to
confirms
the
others
as
to
portuguese
loss
of
trade
on
the
ruin
of
the
city
the
traffic
was
so
large
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
it
the
place
was
immensely
large
and
it
was
inhabited
by
people
rich
not
with
richness
like
ours
but
with
richness
like
that
of
the
crassi
and
the
others
of
those
old
days
and
such
merchandise
diamonds
rubies
pearls
and
besides
all
that
the
horse
trade
that
alone
produced
a
revenue
in
the
city
goa
of
to
thousand
ducats
which
now
reaches
only
thousand
couto
tells
the
same
story
by
this
destruction
of
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
india
and
our
state
were
much
shaken
for
the
bulk
of
the
trade
undertaken
by
all
was
for
this
kingdom
to
which
they
carried
horses
velvets
satins
and
other
sorts
of
merchandize
by
which
they
made
great
profits
and
the
custom
house
of
goa
suffered
much
in
its
revenue
so
that
from
that
day
till
now
the
inhabitants
of
goa
began
to
live
less
well
for
paizes
and
fine
cloths
were
a
trade
of
great
importance
for
persia
and
portugal
and
it
then
languished
and
the
gold
pagodas
of
which
every
year
more
than
were
laden
in
the
ships
of
the
kingdom
were
then
worth
tangas
and
to
day
are
worth
and
similarly
every
kind
of
coin
sassetti
gives
another
reason
however
for
the
decay
of
portuguese
trade
and
influence
at
goa
which
can
not
be
passed
over
without
notice
this
was
the
terrible
inquisition
the
fathers
of
the
church
forbade
the
hindus
under
terrible
penalties
the
use
of
their
own
sacred
books
and
prevented
them
from
all
exercise
of
their
religion
they
destroyed
their
temples
and
mosques
and
so
harassed
and
interfered
with
the
people
that
they
abandoned
the
city
in
large
numbers
refusing
to
remain
any
longer
in
a
place
where
they
had
no
liberty
and
were
liable
to
imprisonment
torture
and
death
if
they
worshipped
after
their
own
fashion
the
gods
of
their
fathers
about
this
period
therefore
the
political
condition
of
southern
india
may
be
thus
summed
up
the
muhammadans
of
the
dakhan
were
triumphant
though
still
divided
in
interest
and
their
country
was
broken
up
into
states
each
bitterly
hostile
to
the
other
the
great
empire
of
the
south
was
sorely
stricken
and
its
capital
was
for
ever
destroyed
the
royal
family
were
refugees
at
pennakonda
king
sadasiva
was
still
a
prisoner
and
tirumala
the
only
survivor
of
the
three
brethren
which
were
tyrants
was
governing
the
kingdom
as
well
as
he
could
the
nobles
were
angry
and
despondent
each
one
seeking
to
be
free
and
the
portuguese
on
the
coast
were
languishing
with
their
trade
irretrievably
injured
firishtah
summarises
the
events
immediately
succeeding
the
great
battle
in
the
following
words
the
sultans
a
few
days
after
the
battle
marched
onwards
into
the
country
of
ramraaje
as
far
as
anicondeh
and
the
advanced
troops
penetrated
to
beejanuggur
which
they
plundered
razed
the
chief
buildings
and
committed
all
manner
of
excess
when
the
depredations
of
the
allies
had
destroyed
all
the
country
round
venkatadri
who
had
escaped
from
the
battle
to
a
distant
fortress
sent
humble
entreaties
of
peace
to
the
sultans
to
whom
he
gave
up
all
the
places
which
his
brothers
had
wrested
from
them
and
the
victors
being
satisfied
took
leave
of
each
other
at
roijore
raichur
and
returned
to
their
several
dominions
the
raaje
of
beejanuggur
since
this
battle
has
never
recovered
its
ancient
splendour
and
the
city
itself
has
been
so
destroyed
that
it
is
now
totally
in
ruins
and
uninhabited
while
the
country
has
been
seized
by
the
zemindars
petty
chiefs
each
of
whom
hath
assumed
an
independent
power
in
his
own
district
in
so
it
is
said
tirumala
murdered
his
sovereign
sadasiva
and
seized
the
throne
for
himself
but
up
to
that
time
he
seems
to
have
recognised
the
unfortunate
prince
as
his
liege
lord
as
we
know
from
four
inscriptions
at
vellore
bearing
a
date
corresponding
to
february
and
thus
began
the
third
dynasty

dynasty
it
can
be
appropriately
called

subsequent
history
in
brief
the
following
is
the
genealogy
of
this
third
family
they
came
apparently
of
the
old
royal
stock
but
their
exact
relationship
to
it
has
never
been
conclusively
settled
the
dates
appended
are
the
dates
of
inscriptions
not
necessarily
the
dates
of
reigns
the
present
rajah
of
anegundi
whose
family
name
is
pampapati
and
who
resides
on
the
old
family
estate
as
a
zamindar
under
the
nizam
of
haidarabad
has
favoured
me
with
a
continuation
of
the
family
tree
to
the
present
day
ranga
or
as
he
is
generally
styled
sri
ranga
is
said
to
have
been
the
youngest
of
three
brothers
sons
of
chinna
venkata
vira
venkatapati
raya
being
the
eldest
gopala
a
junior
member
of
the
family
succeeded
to
the
throne
and
adopted
ranga
who
was
thus
a
junior
member
of
the
eldest
branch
the
eldest
brother
of
ranga
vi
was
ousted
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
whether
this
information
is
correct
but
the
succession
of
the
eldest
is
given
on
the
following
page
pampapati
rajah
is
recognised
by
his
government
as
head
of
the
family
for
two
reasons
first
and
foremost
because
the
elder
line
is
extinct
and
he
was
adopted
by
his
sister
kuppamma
wife
of
krishna
deva
of
the
elder
line
secondly
because
his
two
elder
brothers
are
said
to
have
resigned
their
claims
in
his
favour
the
title
of
the
present
chief
is
sri
ranga
deva
raya
whether
or
no
he
has
better
title
than
his
nephew
kumara
raghava
need
not
here
be
discussed
the
interest
to
the
readers
of
this
history
lies
in
the
fact
that
these
two
are
the
only
surviving
male
descendants
of
the
ancient
royal
house
to
revert
to
the
history
which
need
only
be
shortly
summarised
since
we
have
seen
vijayanagar
destroyed
and
its
territories
in
a
state
of
political
confusion
and
disturbance
i
omit
altogether
the
alternate
political
combinations
and
dissolutions
the
treacheries
quarrels
and
fights
of
the
various
muhammadan
states
after
as
unnecessary
for
our
purpose
and
in
order
to
avoid
prolixity
summarising
only
a
few
matters
which
more
particularly
concern
the
territories
formerly
under
the
great
hindu
empire
according
to
golkonda
accounts
a
year
after
the
great
battle
which
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
vijayanagar
a
general
of
the
qutb
shah
raffat
khan
lari
alias
malik
naib
marched
against
rajahmundry
which
was
finally
captured
from
the
hindus
in
shortly
after
his
return
to
bijapur
so
says
firishtah
ali
adil
shah
moved
again
with
an
army
towards
vijayanagar
but
retired
on
the
ahmadnagar
sultan
advancing
to
oppose
him
and
not
long
afterwards
he
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
reduce
goa
retiring
from
the
coast
he
marched
to
attack
adoni
then
under
one
of
the
vassal
chiefs
of
vijayanagar
who
had
made
himself
independent
in
that
tract
the
place
was
taken
and
the
nizam
shah
agreed
with
the
king
of
bijapur
that
he
would
not
interfere
with
the
latter
attempts
to
annex
the
territories
south
of
the
krishna
if
he
on
his
part
were
left
free
to
conquer
berar
in
therefore
ali
adil
moved
against
dharwar
and
bankapur
the
siege
of
the
latter
place
under
its
chief
velappa
naik
now
independent
lasted
for
a
year
and
six
months
when
the
garrison
reduced
to
great
straits
surrendered
firishtah
states
that
the
adil
shah
destroyed
a
superb
temple
there
and
himself
laid
the
first
stone
of
a
mosque
which
was
built
on
its
foundation
more
successes
followed
in
the
konkan
three
years
later
bellamkonda
was
similarly
attacked
and
the
raya
in
terror
retired
from
penukonda
to
chandragiri
this
campaign
however
resulted
in
failure
apparently
owing
to
the
shah
of
golkonda
assisting
the
hindus
in
the
king
of
golkonda
in
breach
of
his
contract
attacked
and
reduced
the
fortresses
of
vinukonda
and
kondavid
as
well
as
kacharlakota
and
kammam
thus
occupying
large
tracts
south
of
the
krishna
in
ali
adil
was
murdered
firishtah
in
his
history
of
the
qutb
shahs
gives
the
date
as
thursday
safar
but
the
true
day
appears
to
have
been
monday
safar
corresponding
to
monday
april
this
at
least
is
the
date
given
by
an
one
shirazi
who
held
an
important
position
at
the
court
at
the
time
the
question
is
discussed
by
major
king
in
the
indian
antiquary
vol
xvii
p
ibrahim
qutb
shah
of
golkonda
also
died
in
and
was
succeeded
by
muhammad
quli
his
third
son
who
in
founded
the
city
of
haidarabad
originally
carted
bhagnagar
he
carried
on
successful
wars
in
the
present
kurnool
and
cuddapah
districts
capturing
kurnool
nandial
dole
and
gandikota
following
up
these
successes
by
inroads
into
the
eastern
districts
of
nellore
king
tirumala
of
vijayanagar
was
in
followed
apparently
by
his
second
son
ranga
whose
successor
was
his
brother
venkata
i
the
latter
reigned
for
at
least
years
and
died
an
old
man
in
at
his
death
there
were
widespread
revolts
disturbances
and
civil
warfare
as
we
shall
presently
see
from
the
account
of
barradas
given
in
the
next
chapter
an
important
inscription
of
his
reign
dated
in
and
recorded
on
has
been
published
by
dr
hultzsch
in
the
bijapur
sultan
ibrahim
adil
invaded
mysore
which
then
belonged
to
the
raya
and
reduced
the
place
after
a
three
siege
in
the
same
year
this
sultan
brother
ismail
who
had
been
kept
prisoner
at
belgaum
rose
against
his
sovereign
and
declared
himself
independent
king
of
the
place
he
was
besieged
there
by
the
royal
troops
but
owing
to
treachery
in
the
camp
they
failed
to
take
the
place
and
the
territories
in
the
neighbourhood
were
for
some
time
a
prey
to
insurrections
and
disturbances
eventually
they
were
reduced
to
submission
and
the
rebel
was
killed
contemporaneously
with
these
events
the
hindus
again
tried
to
obtain
possession
of
adoni
but
without
success
and
a
war
broke
out
between
the
rival
kingdoms
of
bijapur
and
ahmadnagar
with
this
period
ends
abruptly
the
narrative
of
firishtah
relating
to
the
sultans
of
bijapur
the
golkonda
history
appears
to
differ
widely
from
it
but
i
have
not
thought
it
necessary
here
to
compare
the
two
stories
the
history
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
southern
india
is
one
of
confusion
and
disturbance
the
different
governors
became
independent
the
kings
of
the
decadent
empire
wasted
their
wealth
and
lost
their
territories
so
that
at
length
they
held
a
mere
nominal
sovereignty
and
nothing
remained
but
the
shadow
of
the
once
great
name
the
prestige
of
family
and
yet
even
so
late
as
the
years
and
i
find
a
loyal
reddi
in
the
south
in
recording
on
some
grants
of
land
to
temples
declaring
that
he
did
so
by
permission
of
venkatapati
maharaya
of
vijayanagar
while
i
know
of
eight
other
grants
similarly
recognising
the
old
hindu
royal
family
which
were
engraved
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
ikkeri
or
bednur
chiefs
styled
themselves
of
vijayanagar
till
a
vijayanagar
viceroy
ruled
over
mysore
till
after
which
the
descendants
of
the
former
viceroys
became
rajahs
in
their
own
right
in
madura
and
tanjore
the
nayakkas
became
independent
in
all
the
muhammadan
dynasties
in
the
dakhan
fell
under
the
power
of
the
mogul
emperors
of
delhi
towards
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
whole
of
the
south
of
india
soon
became
practically
theirs
but
meanwhile
another
great
power
had
arisen
and
at
one
time
threatened
to
conquer
all
india
this
was
the
sovereignty
of
the
mahrattas
sivaji
conquered
all
the
konkan
country
by
and
four
years
later
he
had
overthrown
the
last
shreds
of
vijayanagar
authority
in
kurnool
gingi
and
vellore
while
his
brother
ekoji
had
already
in
captured
tanjore
and
established
a
dynasty
there
which
lasted
for
a
century
but
with
this
exception
the
mahrattas
established
no
real
domination
in
the
extreme
south
mysore
remained
independent

its
line
of
hindu
kings

the
throne
was
usurped
by

together

forty
years

the

note
of
occurrences
which
took
place
at
chandragiri
in
on
the
death
of
king
venkata
will
be
found
of
singular
interest
as
it
relates
to
events
of
which
we
in
england
have
hitherto
i
think
been
in
complete
ignorance
in
consists
of
an
extract
from
a
letter
written
at
cochin
on
december
by
manuel
barradas
and
recently
found
by
senhor
lopes
amongst
a
quantity
of
letters
preserved
in
the
national
archives
at
lisbon
he
copied
it
from
the
original
and
kindly
sent
it
to
me
the
translation
is
my
own
i
will
now
tell
you
about
the
death
of
the
old
king
of
bisnaga
called
vencattapatti
rayalu
and
of
his
selection
as
his
successor
of
a
nephew
by
name
chica
rayalu
setting
aside
another
who
was
commonly
held
to
be
his
son
but
who
in
reality
was
not
so
the
true
fact
was
this
the
king
was
married
to
a
daughter
of
jaga
raya
by
name
bayama
and
though
she
eagerly
longed
for
a
son
she
had
none
in
spite
of
the
means
legitimate
or
illegitimate
that
she
employed
for
that
purpose
a
brahman
woman
of
the
household
of
the
queen
father
knowing
how
strong
was
the
queen
desire
to
have
a
son
and
seeing
that
god
had
not
granted
her
one
told
her
that
she
herself
was
pregnant
for
a
month
and
she
advised
her
to
tell
the
king
and
to
publish
it
abroad
that
she
the
queen
had
been
pregnant
for
a
month
and
to
feign
to
be
in
that
state
and
said
that
after
she
the
brahman
woman
had
been
delivered
she
would
secretly
send
the
child
to
the
palace
by
some
confidant
upon
which
the
queen
could
announce
that
this
boy
was
her
own
son
the
advice
seemed
good
to
the
queen
and
she
pretended
that
she
was
pregnant
and
no
sooner
was
the
brahman
woman
delivered
of
a
son
than
she
sent
it
to
the
palace
and
the
news
was
spread
abroad
that
queen
bayama
had
brought
forth
a
son
the
king
knowing
all
this
yet
for
the
love
he
bore
the
queen
and
so
that
the
matter
should
not
come
to
light
dissembled
and
made
feasts
giving
the
name
raya
to
the
boy
which
is
the
name
always
given
to
the
heir
to
the
throne
yet
he
never
treated
him
as
a
son
but
on
the
contrary
kept
him
always
shut
up
in
the
palace
of
chandigri
nor
ever
allowed
him
to
go
out
of
it
without
his
especial
permission
which
indeed
he
never
granted
except
when
in
company
of
the
queen
withal
the
boy
arriving
at
the
age
of
fourteen
years
he
married
him
to
a
niece
of
his
doing
him
much
honour
so
as
to
satisfy
obo
raya
his
three
days
before
his
death
the
king
leaving
aside
as
i
say
this
putative
son
called
for
his
nephew
chica
raya
in
presence
of
several
of
the
nobles
of
the
kingdom
and
extended
towards
him
his
right
hand
on
which
was
the
ring
of
state
and
put
it
close
to
him
so
that
he
should
take
it
and
should
become
his
successor
in
the
kingdom
with
this
the
nephew
bursting
into
tears
begged
the
king
to
give
it
to
whom
he
would
and
that
for
himself
he
did
not
desire
to
be
king
and
he
bent
low
weeping
at
the
feet
of
the
old
man
the
king
made
a
sign
to
those
around
him
that
they
should
raise
the
prince
up
and
they
did
so
and
they
then
placed
him
on
the
king
right
hand
and
the
king
extended
his
own
hand
so
that
he
might
take
the
ring
but
the
prince
lifted
his
hands
above
his
head
as
if
he
already
had
divined
how
much
ill
fortune
the
ring
would
bring
him
and
begged
the
king
to
pardon
him
if
he
wished
not
to
take
it
the
old
man
then
took
the
ring
and
held
it
on
the
point
of
his
finger
offering
it
the
second
time
to
chica
raya
who
by
the
advice
of
the
captains
present
took
it
and
placed
it
on
his
head
and
then
on
his
finger
shedding
many
tears
then
the
king
sent
for
his
robe
valued
at
cruzados
the
great
diamond
which
was
in
his
ear
which
was
worth
more
than
cruzados
his
earrings
valued
at
more
than
and
his
great
pearls
which
are
of
the
highest
price
all
these
royal
insignia
he
gave
to
his
nephew
chica
raya
as
being
his
successor
and
as
such
he
was
at
once
proclaimed
while
some
rejoiced
others
were
displeased
three
days
later
the
king
died
at
the
age
of
years
his
body
was
burned
in
his
own
garden
with
woods
sandal
aloes
and
such
like
and
immediately
afterwards
three
queens
burned
themselves
one
of
whom
was
of
the
same
age
as
the
king
and
the
other
two
aged
years
they
showed
great
courage
they
went
forth
richly
dressed
with
many
jewels
and
gold
ornaments
and
precious
stones
and
arriving
at
the
funeral
pyre
they
divided
these
giving
some
to
their
relatives
some
to
the
brahmans
to
offer
prayers
for
them
and
throwing
some
to
be
scrambled
for
by
the
people
then
they
took
leave
of
all
mounted
on
to
a
lofty
place
and
threw
themselves
into
the
middle
of
the
fire
which
was
very
great
thus
they
passed
into
eternity
then
the
new
king
began
to
rule
compelling
some
of
the
captains
to
leave
the
fortress
but
keeping
others
by
his
side
and
all
came
to
him
to
offer
their
allegiance
except
three
these
were
jaga
raya
who
has
six
hundred
thousand
cruzados
of
revenue
and
puts
twenty
thousand
men
into
the
field
tima
naique
who
has
four
hundred
thousand
cruzados
of
revenue
and
keeps
up
an
army
of
twelve
thousand
men
and
maca
raya
who
has
a
revenue
of
two
hundred
thousand
cruzados
and
musters
six
thousand
men
they
swore
never
to
do
homage
to
the
new
king
but
on
the
contrary
to
raise
in
his
place
the
putative
son
of
the
dead
king
the
nephew
of
jaga
raya
who
was
the
chief
of
this
conspiracy
in
a
few
days
there
occurred
the
following
opportunity
the
new
king
displeased
three
of
his
nobles
the
first
the
dalavay
who
is
the
commander
of
the
army
and
pays
a
tribute
of
five
hundred
thousand
cruzados
because
he
desired
him
to
give
up
three
fortresses
which
the
king
wished
to
confer
on
two
of
his
own
sons
the
second
his
minister
whom
he
asked
to
pay
a
hundred
thousand
cruzados
alleging
that
he
had
stolen
them
from
the
old
king
his
uncle
the
third
narpa
raya
since
he
demanded
the
jewels
which
his
sister
the
wife
of
the
old
king
had
given
to
marpa
all
these
three
answered
the
king
that
they
would
obey
his
commands
within
two
days
but
they
secretly
plotted
with
jaga
raya
to
raise
up
the
latter
nephew
to
be
king
and
this
they
did
in
manner
following
jaga
raya
sent
to
tell
the
king
that
he
wished
to
do
homage
to
him
and
so
also
did
tima
maique
and
maca
raya
the
poor
king
allowed
them
to
enter
jaga
raya
selected
five
thousand
men
and
leaving
the
rest
outside
the
city
he
entered
the
fortress
with
these
chosen
followers
the
two
other
conspirators
did
the
same
each
of
them
bringing
with
them
two
thousand
selected
men
the
fortress
has
two
walls
arrived
at
these
jaga
raya
left
at
the
first
gate
a
thousand
men
and
at
the
second
a
thousand
the
dalavay
seized
two
other
gates
of
the
fortress
on
the
other
side
there
being
some
tumult
and
a
cry
of
treason
being
raised
the
king
ordered
the
palace
gates
to
be
closed
but
the
conspirators
as
soon
as
they
reached
them
began
to
break
them
down
maca
raya
was
the
first
to
succeed
crying
out
that
he
would
deliver
up
the
king
to
them
and
he
did
so
seeding
the
king
a
message
that
if
he
surrendered
he
would
pledge
his
word
to
do
him
no
ill
but
that
the
nephew
of
jaga
raya
must
be
king
he
being
the
son
of
the
late
king
the
poor
surrounded
king
seeing
himself
without
followers
and
without
any
remedy
accepted
the
promise
and
with
his
wife
and
sons
left
the
tower
in
which
he
was
staying
he
passed
through
the
midst
of
the
soldiers
with
a
face
grave
and
severe
and
with
eyes
downcast
there
was
none
to
do
him
reverence
with
hands
as
is
the
custom
joined
over
the
head
nor
did
he
salute
any
one
the
king
having
left
jaga
raya
called
his
nephew
and
crowned
him
causing
all
the
nobles
present
to
do
him
homage
and
he
finding
himself
now
crowned
king
entered
the
palace
and
took
possession
of
it
and
of
all
the
riches
and
precious
stones
that
he
found
there
if
report
says
truly
he
found
in
diamonds
alone
three
large
chests
full
of
fine
stones
after
this
jaga
raya
placed
the
deposed
king
under
the
strictest
guard
and
he
was
deserted
by
all
save
by
one
captain
alone
whose
name
was
echama
naique
who
stopped
outside
the
fortress
with
eight
thousand
men
and
refused
to
join
jaga
raya
indeed
hearing
of
the
treason
he
struck
his
camp
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
fortress
and
began
to
collect
more
troops
jaga
raya
sent
a
message
to
this
man
bidding
him
come
and
do
homage
to
his
nephew
and
saying
that
if
he
refused
he
would
destroy
him
echama
naique
made
answer
that
he
was
not
the
man
to
do
reverence
to
a
boy
who
was
the
son
of
no
one
knew
whom
nor
even
what
his
caste
was
and
so
far
as
destroying
him
went
would
jaga
raya
come
out
and
meet
him
if
so
he
would
wait
for
him
with
such
troops
as
he
possessed
when
this
reply
was
received
jaga
raya
made
use
of
a
thousand
gentle
expressions
and
promised
honours
and
revenues
but
nothing
could
turn
him
nay
echama
took
the
field
with
his
forces
and
offered
battle
to
jaga
raya
saying
that
since
the
latter
had
all
the
captains
on
his
side
let
him
come
and
fight
and
beat
him
if
he
could
and
then
the
nephew
would
become
king
unopposed
in
the
end
jaga
raya
despaired
of
securing
echama
naique
allegiance
but
he
won
over
many
other
nobles
by
gifts
and
promises
while
jaga
raya
was
so
engaged
echama
naique
was
attempting
to
obtain
access
to
the
imprisoned
king
by
some
way
or
other
but
finding
this
not
possible
he
sought
for
a
means
of
at
least
getting
possession
of
one
of
his
sons
and
he
did
so
in
this
manner
he
sent
and
summoned
the
washerman
who
washed
the
imprisoned
king
clothes
and
promised
him
great
things
if
he
would
bring
him
the
king
middle
son
the
washerman
gave
his
word
that
he
would
so
do
if
the
matter
were
kept
secret
when
the
day
arrived
on
which
it
was
the
custom
for
him
to
take
the
clean
clothes
to
the
king
he
carried
them
into
the
prison
and
with
them
a
letter
from
echama
naique
who
earnestly
begged
the
king
to
send
him
one
at
least
of
the
three
sons
whom
he
had
with
him
assuring
him
that
the
washerman
could
effect
his
escape
the
king
did
so
giving
up
his
second
son
aged
twelve
years
for
the
washerman
did
not
dare
take
the
eldest
who
was
eighteen
years
old
he
handed
over
the
boy
and
put
him
in
amongst
the
dirty
clothes
warning
him
to
have
no
fear
and
not
to
cry
out
even
if
he
felt
any
pain
in
order
more
safely
to
pass
the
guards
the
washerman
placed
on
top
of
all
some
very
foul
clothes
such
as
every
one
would
avoid
and
went
out
crying
talla
which
means
at
a
distance
keep
at
a
distance
all
therefore
gave
place
to
him
and
he
went
out
of
the
fortress
to
his
own
house
here
he
kept
the
prince
in
hiding
for
three
days
and
at
the
end
of
them
delivered
him
up
to
echama
naique
whose
camp
was
a
league
distant
from
the
city
and
the
boy
was
received
by
that
chief
and
by
all
his
army
with
great
rejoicing
the
news
then
spread
abroad
and
came
to
the
ears
of
jaga
raya
who
commanded
the
palace
to
be
searched
and
found
that
it
was
true
he
was
so
greatly
affected
that
he
kept
to
his
house
for
several
days
but
he
doubled
the
guards
on
the
king
his
prisoner
closed
the
gates
and
commanded
that
no
one
should
give
aught
to
the
king
to
eat
but
rice
and
coarse
vegetables
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
echama
naique
had
possession
of
the
king
son
there
went
over
to
him
four
of
jaga
raya
captains
with
eight
thousand
men
so
that
he
had
in
all
sixteen
thousand
and
now
had
good
hope
of
defending
the
rightful
king
he
took
therefore
measures
for
effecting
the
latter
escape
he
selected
from
amongst
all
his
soldiers
twenty
men
who
promised
to
attempt
to
dig
an
underground
passage
which
should
reach
to
where
the
king
lay
in
prison
in
pursuance
of
this
resolve
they
went
to
the
fortress
offered
themselves
to
the
dalavay
as
entering
into
his
service
received
pay
and
after
some
days
began
to
dig
the
passage
so
as
to
gain
entrance
to
the
king
prison
the
king
seeing
soldiers
enter
thus
into
his
apartment
was
amazed
and
even
more
so
when
he
saw
them
prostrate
themselves
on
the
ground
and
deliver
him
a
letter
from
echama
naique
in
which
he
begged
the
king
to
trust
himself
to
these
men
as
they
would
escort
him
out
of
the
fortress
the
king
consented
he
took
off
his
robes
hastily
and
covered
himself
with
a
single
cloth
and
bidding
farewell
to
his
wife
his
sons
and
his
daughters
told
them
to
have
no
fear
for
that
he
when
free
would
save
them
all
but
it
so
happened
that
at
this
very
moment
one
of
the
soldiers
who
were
guarding
the
palace
by
night
with
torches
fell
into
a
hole
and
at
his
cries
the
rest
ran
up
and
on
digging
they
discovered
the
underground
passage
they
entered
it
and
got
as
far
as
the
palace
arriving
there
just
when
the
unhappy
king
was
descending
into
it
in
order
to
escape
he
was
seized
and
the
alarm
given
to
jaga
raya
who
sent
the
king
to
another
place
more
confined
and
narrower
and
with
more
guards
so
that
the
poor
prisoner
despaired
of
ever
escaping
echama
naique
seeing
that
this
stratagem
had
failed
bribed
heavily
a
captain
of
five
hundred
men
who
were
in
the
fortress
to
slay
the
guards
as
soon
as
some
good
occasion
offered
and
to
rescue
the
king
this
man
who
was
called
iteobleza
finding
one
day
that
jaga
raya
was
leaving
the
palace
with
all
his
men
in
order
to
receive
a
certain
chief
who
had
proffered
his
submission
and
that
there
only
remained
in
the
fortress
about
five
thousand
men
in
less
than
an
hour
slew
the
guards
seized
three
gates
and
sent
a
message
to
echama
naique
telling
him
to
come
at
once
and
seize
the
fortress
but
jaga
raya
was
the
more
expeditious
he
returned
with
all
his
forces
entered
by
a
postern
gate
of
the
existence
of
which
iteobleza
had
not
been
warned
and
put
to
death
the
captain
and
his
five
hundred
followers
enraged
at
this
attempt
jaga
raya
to
strengthen
the
party
of
his
nephew
resolved
to
slay
the
king
and
all
his
family
he
entrusted
this
business
to
a
brother
of
his
named
chinaobraya
ordering
him
to
go
to
the
palace
and
tell
the
poor
king
that
he
must
slay
himself
and
that
if
he
would
not
he
himself
would
kill
him
with
stabs
of
his
dagger
the
prisoner
attempted
to
excuse
himself
saying
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
attempted
revolt
but
seeing
the
determination
of
chinaobraya
who
told
him
that
he
must
necessarily
die
either
by
his
own
hand
or
by
that
of
another
a
most
pitiful
case
and
one
that
i
relate
full
of
sorrow
the
poor
king
called
his
wife
and
after
he
had
spoken
to
her
awhile
he
beheaded
her
then
he
sent
for
his
youngest
son
and
did
the
same
to
him
he
put
to
death
similarly
his
little
daughter
afterwards
he
sent
for
his
eldest
son
who
was
already
married
and
commanded
him
to
slay
his
wife
which
he
did
by
beheading
her
this
done
the
king
took
a
long
sword
of
four
breadth
and
throwing
himself
upon
it
breathed
his
last
and
his
son
heir
to
the
throne
did
the
same
to
himself
in
imitation
of
his
father
there
remained
only
a
little
daughter
whom
the
king
could
not
bring
himself
to
slay
but
chinaobraya
killed
her
so
that
none
of
the
family
should
remain
alive
of
the
blood
royal
and
the
throne
should
be
secured
for
his
nephew
some
of
the
chiefs
were
struck
with
horror
at
this
dreadful
deed
and
were
so
enraged
at
its
cruelty
that
they
went
over
to
echama
naique
resolved
to
defend
the
prince
who
had
been
rescued
by
the
washerman
and
who
alone
remained
of
all
the
royal
family
echama
naique
furious
at
this
shameful
barbarity
and
confident
in
the
justice
of
his
cause
selected
ten
thousand
of
his
best
soldiers
and
with
them
offered
battle
to
jaga
raya
who
had
more
than
sixty
thousand
men
and
a
number
of
elephants
and
horses
echama
sent
him
a
message
in
this
form
that
thou
hast
murdered
thy
king
and
all
his
family
and
there
alone
remains
this
boy
whom
i
rescued
from
thee
and
have
in
my
keeping
come
out
and
take
the
field
with
all
thy
troops
kill
him
and
me
and
then
thy
nephew
will
be
secure
on
the
throne
jaga
raya
tried
to
evade
this
for
some
time
but
finding
that
echama
naique
insisted
he
decided
to
fight
him
trusting
that
with
so
great
a
number
of
men
he
would
easily
not
only
be
victorious
but
would
be
able
to
capture
both
echama
naique
and
the
prince
he
took
the
field
therefore
with
all
his
troops
echama
naique
entrusted
the
prince
to
a
force
of
ten
thousand
men
who
remained
a
league
away
and
with
the
other
ten
thousand
he
not
only
offered
battle
but
was
the
first
to
attack
and
that
with
such
fury
and
violence
that
jaga
raya
with
all
the
people
surrounding
his
nephew
was
driven
to
one
side
leaving
gaps
open
to
the
enemy
and
many
met
their
deaths
in
the
fight
echama
naique
entered
in
triumph
the
tents
of
jaga
raya
finding
in
them
all
the
royal
insignia
belonging
to
the
old
king
and
these
he
delivered
to
the
young
prince
the
son
of
chica
raya
proclaiming
him
rightful
heir
and
king
of
all
the
empire
of
bisnaga
the
spoil
which
he
took
was
very
large
for
in
precious
stones
alone
they
say
that
he
found
two
millions
worth
after
this
victory
many
of
the
nobles
joined
themselves
to
echama
naique
so
much
so
that
in
a
short
time
he
had
with
him
fifty
thousand
fighting
men
in
his
camp
while
jaga
raya
with
only
fifteen
thousand
fled
to
the
jungles
here
however
he
was
joined
by
more
people
so
that
the
war
has
continued
these
two
years
fortune
favouring
now
one
side
now
the
other
but
the
party
of
the
young
prince
has
always
been
gaining
strength
the
more
so
because
although
the
great
naique
of
madura
a
page
of
the
betel
to
the
king
of
bisnaga
who
pays
a
revenue
every
year
of
some
say
pagodas
and
has
under
him
many
kings
and
nobles
as
vassals
such
as
he
of
travancor
took
the
side
of
jaga
raya
and
sustained
him
against
the
naique
of
tanjaor
yet
the
latter
though
not
so
powerful
is
with
the
aid
of
the
young
king
gradually
getting
the
upper
hand
indeed
there
are
now
assembled
in
the
field
in
the
large
open
plains
of
trinchenepali
not
only
the
hundred
thousand
men
that
each
party
has
but
as
many
as
a
million
of
soldiers
taking
advantage
of
these
civil
wars
the
city
of
san
thome
which
up
to
now
belonged
to
the
king
of
bisnaga
paying
him
revenues
and
customs
which
he
used
to
make
over
to
certain
chiefs
by
whom
the
portuguese
were
often
greatly
troubled
determined
to
liberate
itself
and
become
in
everything
and
for
everything
the
property
of
the
king
of
portugal
to
this
end
she
begged
the
viceroy
to
send
and
take
possession
of
her
in
the
name
of
his
majesty
which
he
did
as
i
shall
afterwards
tell
you
meanwhile
the
captain
who
governed
the
town
by
name
manuel
de
frias
seeing
that
there
was
close
to
the
town
a
fortress
that
commanded
it
determined
to
seize
it
by
force
seeing
that
its
captain
declined
to
surrender
it
so
he
laid
siege
to
it
surrounding
it
so
closely
that
no
one
could
get
out
in
the
end
the
portuguese
were
successful
the
fortress
was
taken
its
garrison
of
men
capitulated
and
a
fleet
came
round
by
sea
to
complete
the
conquest
the
foregoing
story
relates
to
events
never
before
i
think
made
known
to
english
readers
and
so
far
is
of
the
highest
interest
let
us
for
the
moment
grant
its
accuracy
and
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
genealogical
table
already
given
king
venkata
i
had
a
sister
who
was
married
to
a
chief
whom
barradas
calls
obo
perhaps
obala
raya
so
far
as
we
know
his
only
nephews
were
tirumala
ii
and
ranga
sons
of
his
brother
rama
iii
since
tirumala
ii
appears
to
have
had
no
sons
and
ranga
iii
had
a
son
rama
iv
who
is
asserted
in
the
inscriptions
to
have
been
one
of
several
brothers
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
nephew
mentioned
by
barradas
who
was
raised
to
be
king
on
the
death
of
the
old
king
venkata
in
and
who
had
three
sons
was
ranga
called
chikka
raya
or
in
the
text
he
then
succeeded
in
but
was
afterwards
deposed
imprisoned
and
compelled
to
take
his
own
life
his
eldest
son
at
the
same
time
followed
his
example
and
his
youngest
son
was
slain
by
his
father
the
middle
son
escaped
and
was
raised
to
the
throne
by
a
friendly
chief
named
echama
naik
this
second
son
was
probably
ranga
iv
two
of
king
venkata
wives
were
bayama
daughter
of
jaga
raya
and
a
lady
unnamed
sister
of
narpa
raya
a
niece
of
venkata
had
been
given
in
marriage
to
a
brahman
boy
who
had
been
surreptitiously
introduced
into
the
palace
by
bayama
and
educated
in
the
pretence
that
he
was
son
of
king
venkata
the
plot
to
raise
him
to
the
throne
was
temporarily
successful
and
ranga
iii
and
all
the
royal
family
were
killed
saving
only
ranga
who
afterwards
came
to
the
throne
how
much
of
the
story
told
is
true
we
can
not
as
yet
decide
but
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
the
whole
is
a
pure
invention
and
we
may
for
the
present
accept
it
fixing
the
date
of
these
occurrences
as
certainly
between
the
years
and
the
date
of
barradas
letter
being
december
in
the
latter
year
it
will
be
observed
that
the
inscriptions
upon
which
the
genealogical
table
given
above
from
the
epigraphia
indica
is
founded
do
not
yield
any
date
between
and
when
pedda
venkata
ii
is
named
as
king
in
i
published
a
list
of
vijayanagar
names
derived
from
reports
of
inscriptions
which
had
then
reached
me
i
am
by
no
means
certain
of
their
accuracy
and
it
is
clear
that
they
must
all
be
hereafter
carefully
examined
but
so
far
as
it
goes
the
list
runs
thus
ranga
rama
ranga
venkata
rama
venkata
the
name
and
date
are
apparently
correct
in
the
portuguese
encouraged
by
the
vijayanagar
king
still
at
chandragiri
attempted
to
eject
the
dutch
from
paleacate
or
pulicat
an
arrangement
was
made
by
which
the
portuguese
were
to
attack
by
sea
and
the
rajah
by
land
but
while
the
viceroy
sent
his
twelve
ships
as
agreed
on
the
rajah
failed
to
attack
alleging
in
explanation
that
he
was
compelled
to
use
his
army
to
put
down
internal
disturbances
in
the
kingdom
a
second
expedition
met
with
no
better
success
the
plans
of
the
portuguese
being
again
upset
by
the
non
fulfilment
of
the
king
part
of
the
bargain
on
the
departure
of
the
fleet
the
king
did
attack
the
dutch
settlement
but
was
bought
off
by
a
large
payment
and
the
hollanders
remained
subsequently
undisturbed
senhor
lopes
tells
me
that
he
has
found
in
the
national
archives
in
the
torre
do
tombo
amongst
the
livros
das
moncoes
a
number
of
papers
bearing
on
this
subject
the
most
interesting
are
those
contained
in
volume
xxxiv
fol
these
were
written
by
the
of
meliapor
thome
by
padre
pero
mexia
of
the
company
of
jesus
and
by
the
bishop
and
amongst
the
other
documents
are
to
be
seen
translations
of
two
letters
written
by
the
king
of
vijayanagar
then
at
vellore
it
appears
from
these
that
the
king
was
devoid
of
energy
and
that
one
timma
raya
had
revolted
against
him
we
know
that
in
the
king
of
vijayanagar
was
named
ranga
or
and
that
he
was
at
that
time
residing
at
chandragiri
because
in
that
year
day
the
head
of
the
english
trading
station
a
madras
obtained
from
the
king
a
grant
of
land
at
that
place
one
mile
broad
by
five
miles
long
on
which
fort
george
was
afterwards
constructed
the
country
about
madras
was
then
ruled
over
by
a
governor
or
naik
and
so
little
heed
did
he
pay
to
the
wishes
or
commands
of
his
titular
sovereign
that
although
the
raya
had
directed
that
the
name
of
the
new
town
should
be
srirangarayalapatnam
city
of
sri
ranga
raya
the
naik
christened
it
after
the
name
of
his
own
father
chenna
and
called
it
chennapatnam
by
which
appellation
it
has
ever
since
been
known
to
the
hindus
such
at
least
is
the
local
tradition
this
king
was
probably
the
ranga
vi
of
the
epigraphia
list
mentioned
as
living
in
after
this
date
my
doubtful
and
unexamined
inscriptions
yield
the
following
names
and
dates
ranga
venkata
ranga
venkata
ranga
mahadeva
ranga
venkata
rama
venkata
venkata
from
sir
thomas
munro
papers
i
gather
that
the
territory
about
the
old
family
estate
of
anegundi
was
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
held
by
the
rayas
from
the
mogul
emperor
of
delhi
as
a
tributary
state
in
it
was
seized
by
the
mahrattas
and
in
it
was
reduced
by
haidar
ali
of
mysore
but
continued
to
exist
as
a
tributary
state
till
the
time
of
tipu
tippoo
sultan
tipu
who
never
suffered
from
an
excess
of
compunction
or
compassion
when
his
own
interests
were
at
stake
annexed
the
estate
bodily
to
his
dominions
in
thirteen
years
later
he
was
killed
at
seringapatam
and
in
the
settlement
that
followed
the
little
territory
was
made
over
to
the
nizam
of
haidarabad
the
english
government
retaining
all
lands
on
their
side
of
the
tungabhadra
partly
in
compensation
for
this
loss
of
land
the
government
has
till
very
recently
paid
an
annual
pension
to
the
head
of
the
anegundi
family
this
has
now
been
abolished
chronicles
of
paes
and
nuniz
letter
to
the
historian
barros
which
accompanied
the
chronicles
when
sent
from
india
to
portugal
about
the
year
since
i
have
lived
till
now
in
this
city
goa
it
seemed
necessary
to
do
what
your
honour
desired
of
me
namely
to
search
for
men
who
had
formerly
been
in
bisnaga
for
i
know
that
no
one
goes
there
without
bringing
away
his
quire
of
paper
written
about
its
affairs
thus
i
obtained
this
summary
from
one
domingos
paes
who
goes
there
and
who
was
at
bisnaga
in
the
time
of
crisnarao
when
cristovao
de
figueiredo
was
there
i
obtained
another
from
fernao
nuniz
who
was
there
three
years
trading
in
horses
which
did
not
prove
remunerative
since
one
man
can
not
tell
everything
one
relating
some
things
which
another
does
not
i
send
both
the
summaries
made
by
them
namely
one
in
the
time
of
crisnarao
as
i
have
said
and
the
other
sent
from
there
six
months
since
i
desire
to
do
this
because
your
honour
can
gather
what
is
useful
to
you
from
both
and
because
you
will
thus
give
the
more
credit
to
some
things
in
the
chronicle
of
the
kings
of
bisnaga
since
they
conform
one
to
the
other
the
copy
of
the
summary
which
he
began
to
make
when
he
first
went
to
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
is
as
follows
narrative
of
domingos
paes
written
probably
of
the
things
which
i
saw
and
contrived
to
learn
concerning
the
kingdom
of
narsimga
etc
on
leaving
india
to
travel
towards
the
kingdom
of
narsymga
from
the
you
have
first
to
pass
a
range
of
hills
serra
the
boundary
of
the
said
kingdom
and
of
those
territories
which
are
by
the
sea
this
serra
runs
along
the
whole
of
the
coast
of
india
and
has
passes
by
which
people
enter
the
interior
for
all
the
rest
of
the
range
is
very
rocky
and
is
filled
with
thick
forest
the
said
kingdom
has
many
places
on
the
coast
of
india
they
are
seaports
with
which
we
are
at
peace
and
in
some
of
them
we
have
factories
namely
amcola
mirgeo
honor
batecalla
mamgalor
bracalor
and
bacanor
and
as
soon
as
we
are
above
this
serra
we
have
a
plain
country
in
which
there
are
no
more
ranges
of
hills
but
only
a
few
mountains
and
these
small
ones
for
all
the
rest
is
like
the
plains
of
ssantarem
only
on
the
road
from
batecala
to
a
town
called
zambuja
there
are
some
ranges
with
forests
nevertheless
the
road
is
very
even
from
batecala
to
this
town
of
zambur
is
forty
leagues
the
road
has
many
streams
of
water
by
its
side
and
because
of
this
so
much
merchandise
flows
to
batecala
that
every
year
there
come
five
or
six
thousand
now
to
tell
of
the
aforesaid
kingdom
it
is
a
country
sparsely
wooded
except
along
this
serra
on
the
east
but
in
places
you
walk
for
two
or
three
leagues
under
groves
of
trees
and
behind
cities
and
towns
and
villages
they
have
plantations
of
mangoes
and
trees
and
tamarinds
and
other
very
large
trees
which
form
where
merchants
halt
with
their
merchandise
i
saw
in
the
city
of
recalem
a
tree
under
which
we
lodged
three
hundred
and
twenty
horses
standing
in
order
as
in
their
stables
and
all
over
the
country
you
may
see
many
small
trees
these
dominions
are
very
well
cultivated
and
very
fertile
and
are
provided
with
quantities
of
cattle
such
as
cows
buffaloes
and
sheep
also
of
birds
both
those
belonging
to
the
hills
and
those
reared
at
home
and
this
in
greater
abundance
than
in
our
tracts
the
land
has
plenty
of
rice
and
grains
beans
and
other
kind
of
crops
which
are
not
sown
in
our
parts
also
an
infinity
of
cotton
of
the
grains
there
is
a
great
quantity
because
besides
being
used
as
food
for
men
it
is
also
used
for
horses
since
there
is
no
other
kind
of
barley
and
this
country
has
also
much
wheat
and
that
good
the
whole
country
is
thickly
populated
with
cities
and
towns
and
villages
the
king
allows
them
to
be
surrounded
only
with
earthen
walls
for
fear
of
their
becoming
too
strong
but
if
a
city
is
situated
at
the
extremity
of
his
territory
he
gives
his
consent
to
its
having
stone
walls
but
never
the
towns
so
that
they
may
make
fortresses
of
the
cities
but
not
of
the
towns
and
because
this
country
is
all
flat
the
winds
blow
here
more
than
in
other
parts
the
oil
which
it
produces
comes
from
seeds
sown
and
afterwards
reaped
and
they
obtain
it
by
means
of
machines
which
they
make
this
country
wants
water
because
it
is
very
great
and
has
few
streams
they
make
lakes
in
which
water
collects
when
it
rains
and
thereby
they
maintain
themselves
they
maintain
themselves
by
means
of
some
in
which
there
are
springs
better
than
by
others
that
have
only
the
water
from
rain
for
we
find
many
quite
dry
so
that
people
go
about
walking
in
their
beds
and
dig
holes
to
try
and
find
enough
water
even
a
little
for
their
maintenance
the
failure
of
the
water
is
because
they
have
no
winter
as
in
our
parts
and
in
portuguese
india
but
only
that
are
greater
in
one
year
than
in
another
the
water
in
these
lakes
is
for
the
most
part
muddy
especially
in
those
where
there
are
no
springs
and
the
reason
why
it
is
so
muddy
is
because
of
the
strong
wind
and
the
dust
that
is
in
this
country
which
never
allows
the
water
to
be
clear
and
also
because
of
the
numbers
of
cattle
buffaloes
cows
oxen
and
other
small
cattle
that
drink
in
them
for
you
must
know
that
in
this
land
they
do
not
slaughter
oxen
or
cows
the
oxen
are
beasts
of
burden
and
are
like
these
carry
all
their
goods
they
worship
the
cows
and
have
them
in
their
pagodas
made
in
stone
and
also
bulls
they
have
many
bulls
that
they
present
to
these
pagodas
and
these
bulls
go
about
the
city
without
any
one
causing
them
any
harm
or
loss
further
there
are
asses
in
this
country
but
they
are
small
and
they
use
them
only
for
little
things
those
that
wash
clothes
lay
the
cloths
on
them
and
use
them
for
this
more
than
for
anything
else
you
must
know
that
this
kingdom
of
narsymga
has
three
hundred
graos
of
coast
each
grao
being
a
league
along
the
serra
of
which
i
have
spoken
until
you
arrive
at
ballagate
and
charamaodel
which
belong
to
this
kingdom
and
in
breadth
it
is
one
hundred
and
graos
each
large
grao
measures
two
of
our
leagues
so
that
it
has
six
hundred
leagues
of
coast
and
across
it
three
hundred
and
leagues
across
from
batacalla
to
the
kingdom
of
orya
and
this
kingdom
marches
with
all
the
territory
of
bengal
and
on
the
other
side
with
the
kingdom
of
orya
which
is
to
the
east
and
on
the
other
side
to
the
north
with
the
kingdom
of
dakhan
belonging
to
which
are
the
lands
which
the
ydallcao
has
and
ozemelluco
goa
is
at
war
with
this
ydallcao
because
that
city
was
his
and
we
have
taken
it
from
him
and
this
kingdom
of
orya
of
which
i
have
spoken
above
is
said
to
be
much
larger
than
the
kingdom
of
narsymga
since
it
marches
with
all
bengal
and
is
at
war
with
her
and
it
marches
with
all
the
kingdom
of
pegu
and
with
the
mallaca
sea
it
reaches
to
the
kingdom
of
cambaya
and
to
the
kingdom
of
dakhan
and
they
told
me
with
positive
certainty
that
it
extends
as
far
as
persia
the
population
thereof
is
light
coloured
and
the
men
are
of
good
physique
its
king
has
much
treasure
and
many
soldiers
and
many
elephants
for
there
are
numbers
of
these
in
this
country
my
informants
know
this
well
and
they
say
that
there
is
no
ruler
greater
than
he
he
is
a
heathen
coming
back
to
our
subject
i
say
that
i
will
not
mention
here
the
situation
of
the
cities
and
towns
and
villages
in
this
kingdom
of
narsymga
to
avoid
prolixity
only
i
shall
speak
of
the
city
of
darcha
which
has
a
monument
such
as
can
seldom
be
seen
elsewhere
this
city
of
darcha
is
very
well
fortified
by
a
wall
though
not
of
stone
for
the
reason
that
i
have
already
stated
on
the
western
side
which
is
towards
portuguese
india
it
is
surrounded
by
a
very
beautiful
river
and
on
the
other
eastern
side
the
interior
of
the
country
is
all
one
plain
and
along
the
wall
is
its
moat
this
darcha
has
a
pagoda
which
is
the
monument
i
speak
of
so
beautiful
that
another
as
good
of
its
kind
could
not
be
found
within
a
great
distance
you
must
know
that
it
is
a
round
temple
made
of
a
single
stone
the
gateway
all
in
the
manner
of
joiners
work
with
every
art
of
perspective
there
are
many
figures
of
the
said
work
standing
out
as
much
as
a
cubit
from
the
stone
so
that
you
see
on
every
side
of
them
so
well
carved
that
they
could
not
be
better
done
the
faces
as
well
as
all
the
rest
and
each
one
in
its
place
stands
as
if
embowered
in
leaves
and
above
it
is
in
the
romanesque
style
so
well
made
that
it
could
not
be
better
besides
this
it
has
a
sort
of
lesser
porch
upon
pillars
all
of
stone
and
the
pillars
with
their
pedestals
so
well
executed
that
they
appear
as
if
made
in
italy
all
the
cross
pieces
and
beams
are
of
the
same
stone
without
any
planks
or
timber
being
used
in
it
and
in
the
same
way
all
the
ground
is
laid
with
the
same
stone
outside
as
well
as
in
and
all
this
pagoda
as
far
round
as
the
temple
goes
is
enclosed
by
a
trellis
made
of
the
same
stone
and
this
again
is
completely
surrounded
by
a
very
strong
wall
better
even
than
the
city
has
since
it
is
all
of
solid
masonry
it
has
three
entrance
gates
which
gates
are
very
large
and
beautiful
and
the
entrance
from
one
of
these
sides
being
towards
the
east
and
facing
the
door
of
the
pagoda
has
some
structures
like
verandahs
small
and
low
where
sit
some
jogis
and
inside
this
enclosure
which
has
other
little
pagodas
of
a
reddish
colour
there
is
a
stone
like
the
mast
of
a
ship
with
its
pedestal
and
from
thence
to
the
top
standing
in
the
open
air
i
was
not
astonished
at
it
because
i
have
seen
the
needle
of
peters
at
rome
which
is
as
high
or
more
these
pagodas
are
buildings
in
which
they
pray
and
have
their
idols
the
idols
are
of
many
sorts
namely
figures
of
men
and
women
of
bulls
and
apes
while
others
have
nothing
but
a
round
stone
which
they
worship
in
this
temple
of
darcha
is
an
idol
in
the
figure
of
a
man
as
to
his
body
and
the
face
is
that
of
an
elephant
with
trunk
and
tusks
and
with
three
arms
on
each
side
and
six
hands
of
which
arms
they
say
that
already
four
are
gone
and
when
all
fall
then
the
world
will
be
destroyed
they
are
full
of
belief
that
this
will
be
and
hold
it
as
a
prophecy
they
feed
the
idol
every
day
for
they
say
that
he
eats
and
when
he
eats
women
dance
before
him
who
belong
to
that
pagoda
and
they
give
him
food
and
all
that
is
necessary
and
all
girls
born
of
these
women
belong
to
the
temple
these
women
are
of
loose
character
and
live
in
the
best
streets
that
there
are
in
the
city
it
is
the
same
in
all
their
cities
their
streets
have
the
best
rows
of
houses
they
are
very
much
esteemed
and
are
classed
amongst
those
honoured
ones
who
are
the
mistresses
of
the
captains
any
respectable
man
may
go
to
their
houses
without
any
blame
attaching
thereto
these
women
are
allowed
even
to
enter
the
presence
of
the
wives
of
the
king
and
they
stay
with
them
and
eat
betel
with
them
a
thing
which
no
other
person
may
do
no
matter
what
his
rank
may
be
this
betel
is
a
herb
which
has
a
leaf
like
the
leaf
of
the
pepper
or
the
ivy
of
our
country
they
always
eat
this
leaf
and
carry
it
in
their
mouths
with
another
fruit
called
areca
this
is
something
like
a
medlar
but
it
is
very
hard
and
it
is
very
good
for
the
breath
and
has
many
other
virtues
it
is
the
best
provision
for
those
who
do
not
eat
as
we
do
some
of
them
eat
flesh
they
eat
all
kinds
except
beef
and
pork
and
yet
nevertheless
they
cease
not
to
eat
this
betel
all
day
afterwards
going
from
this
city
of
darcha
towards
the
city
of
bisnaga
which
is
eighteen
leagues
distant
and
is
the
capital
of
all
the
kingdom
of
narsymga
where
the
king
always
resides
you
have
many
cities
and
walled
villages
and
two
leagues
before
you
arrive
at
the
city
of
bisnaga
you
have
a
very
lofty
serra
which
has
passes
by
which
you
enter
the
city
these
are
called
gates
portas
you
must
enter
by
these
for
you
will
have
no
means
of
entrance
except
by
them
this
range
of
hills
surrounds
the
city
with
a
circle
of
leagues
and
within
this
range
there
are
others
that
encircle
it
closely
wherever
these
ranges
have
any
level
ground
they
cross
it
with
a
very
strong
wall
in
such
a
way
that
the
hills
remain
all
closed
except
in
the
places
where
the
roads
come
through
from
the
gates
in
the
first
range
which
are
the
entrance
ways
to
the
city
in
such
places
there
are
some
small
pits
or
caves
which
could
be
defended
by
a
few
people
these
serras
continue
as
far
as
the
interior
of
the
city
between
all
these
enclosures
are
plains
and
valleys
where
rice
is
grown
and
there
are
gardens
with
many
limes
citrons
and
radishes
rabaos
and
other
kinds
of
garden
produce
as
in
portugal
only
not
lettuces
or
cabbages
between
these
are
many
lakes
by
which
they
irrigate
the
crops
mentioned
and
amongst
all
these
ranges
there
are
no
forests
or
patches
of
brushwood
except
very
small
ones
nor
anything
that
is
green
for
these
hills
are
the
strangest
ever
seen
they
are
of
a
white
stone
piled
one
block
over
another
in
manner
most
singular
so
that
it
seems
as
if
they
stood
in
the
air
and
were
not
connected
one
with
another
and
the
city
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
these
hills
and
is
entirely
surrounded
by
them
the
serras
reach
as
far
as
the
kingdom
of
daquem
and
border
upon
the
territories
belonging
to
the
ydallcao
and
upon
a
city
called
rachol
that
formerly
belonged
to
the
king
of
narsymga
there
has
been
much
war
over
it
and
this
king
took
it
from
the
ydallcao
so
that
these
ranges
are
in
a
way
the
cause
of
the
two
kingdoms
never
uniting
and
always
being
at
war
and
even
on
the
side
of
orya
also
there
are
ranges
but
they
are
different
from
these
since
like
ours
they
have
scrub
and
small
patches
of
brushwood
these
ranges
are
low
and
between
them
are
great
plains
on
the
extreme
east
of
these
two
kingdoms
you
must
know
that
the
country
is
all
covered
with
scrub
the
densest
possible
to
be
seen
in
which
there
are
great
beasts
and
this
forms
so
strong
a
fortress
for
it
that
it
protects
both
sides
it
has
its
entrances
by
which
they
pass
from
one
kingdom
to
the
other
in
these
passes
on
the
frontier
the
king
of
narsymga
has
a
captain
with
a
quantity
of
troops
but
on
the
side
of
portuguese
india
he
has
none
except
as
i
have
said
now
turning
to
the
gates
of
the
first
range
i
say
that
at
the
entrance
of
the
gate
where
those
pass
who
come
from
goa
which
is
the
principal
entrance
on
the
western
side
this
king
has
made
within
it
a
very
strong
city
fortified
with
walls
and
towers
and
the
gates
at
the
entrances
very
strong
with
towers
at
the
gates
these
walls
are
not
like
those
of
other
cities
but
are
made
of
very
strong
masonry
such
as
would
be
found
in
few
other
parts
and
inside
very
beautiful
rows
of
buildings
made
after
their
manner
with
flat
roofs
there
live
in
this
many
merchants
and
it
is
filled
with
a
large
population
because
the
king
induces
many
honourable
merchants
to
go
there
from
his
cities
and
there
is
much
water
in
it
besides
this
the
king
made
a
tank
there
which
as
it
seems
to
me
has
the
width
of
a
and
it
is
at
the
mouth
of
two
hills
so
that
all
the
water
which
comes
from
either
one
side
or
the
other
collects
there
and
besides
this
water
comes
to
it
from
more
than
three
leagues
by
pipes
which
run
along
the
lower
parts
of
the
range
outside
this
water
is
brought
from
a
lake
which
itself
overflows
into
a
little
river
the
tank
has
three
large
pillars
handsomely
carved
with
figures
these
connect
above
with
certain
pipes
by
which
they
get
water
when
they
have
to
irrigate
their
gardens
and
in
order
to
make
this
tank
the
said
king
broke
down
a
hill
which
enclosed
the
ground
occupied
by
the
said
tank
in
the
tank
i
saw
so
many
people
at
work
that
there
must
have
been
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
men
looking
like
ants
so
that
you
could
not
see
the
ground
on
which
they
walked
so
many
there
were
this
tank
the
king
portioned
out
amongst
his
captains
each
of
whom
had
the
duty
of
seeing
that
the
people
placed
under
him
did
their
work
and
that
the
tank
was
finished
and
brought
to
completion
the
tank
burst
two
or
three
times
and
the
king
asked
his
brahmans
to
consult
their
idol
as
to
the
reason
why
it
burst
so
often
and
the
brahmans
said
that
the
idol
was
displeased
and
desired
that
they
should
make
a
sacrifice
and
should
give
him
the
blood
of
men
and
horses
and
buffaloes
and
as
soon
as
the
king
heard
this
he
forthwith
commanded
that
at
the
gate
of
the
pagoda
the
heads
of
sixty
men
should
be
cut
off
and
of
certain
horses
and
buffaloes
which
was
at
once
done
these
brahmans
are
like
friars
with
us
and
they
count
them
as
holy
men
i
speak
of
the
brahman
priests
and
the
lettered
men
of
the
pagodas
because
although
the
king
has
many
brahmans
they
are
officers
of
the
towns
and
cities
and
belong
to
the
government
of
them
others
are
merchants
and
others
live
by
their
own
property
and
cultivation
and
the
fruits
which
grow
in
their
inherited
grounds
those
who
have
charge
of
the
temples
are
learned
men
and
eat
nothing
which
suffers
death
neither
flesh
nor
fish
nor
anything
which
makes
broth
red
for
they
say
that
it
is
blood
some
of
the
other
brahmans
whom
i
mentioned
who
seek
to
serve
god
and
to
do
penance
and
to
live
a
life
like
that
of
the
priests
do
not
eat
flesh
or
fish
or
any
other
thing
that
suffers
death
but
only
vegetables
and
butter
and
other
things
which
they
make
of
fruit
with
their
rice
they
are
all
married
and
have
very
beautiful
wives
the
wives
are
very
retiring
and
very
seldom
leave
the
house
the
women
are
of
light
colour
and
in
the
caste
of
these
brahmans
are
the
fairest
men
and
women
that
there
are
in
the
land
for
though
there
are
men
in
other
castes
commonly
of
light
complexion
yet
these
are
few
there
are
many
in
this
country
who
call
themselves
brahmans
but
they
lead
a
life
very
different
from
those
of
whom
i
have
spoken
for
these
last
are
men
to
whom
the
king
pays
much
honour
and
he
holds
them
in
great
favour
this
new
city
that
the
king
made
bears
the
name
of
his
wife
for
love
of
whom
he
made
it
and
the
said
city
stands
in
a
plain
and
round
it
the
inhabitants
make
their
gardens
as
the
ground
suits
each
one
being
separate
in
this
city
the
king
made
a
temple
with
many
images
it
is
a
thing
very
well
made
and
it
has
some
wells
very
well
made
after
their
fashion
its
houses
are
not
built
with
stories
like
ours
but
are
of
only
one
floor
with
flat
roofs
and
towers
different
from
ours
for
theirs
go
from
storey
to
storey
they
have
pillars
and
are
all
open
with
verandahs
inside
and
out
where
they
can
easily
put
people
if
they
desire
so
that
they
seem
like
houses
belonging
to
a
king
these
palaces
have
an
enclosing
wall
which
surrounds
them
all
and
inside
are
many
rows
of
houses
before
you
enter
the
place
where
the
king
is
there
are
two
gates
with
many
guards
who
prevent
any
one
from
entering
except
the
captains
and
men
who
have
business
there
and
between
these
two
gates
is
a
very
large
court
with
its
verandahs
round
it
where
these
captains
and
other
honoured
people
wait
till
the
king
summons
them
to
his
presence
this
king
is
of
medium
height
and
of
fair
complexion
and
good
figure
rather
fat
than
thin
he
has
on
his
face
signs
of
he
is
the
most
feared
and
perfect
king
that
could
possibly
be
cheerful
of
disposition
and
very
merry
he
is
one
that
seeks
to
honour
foreigners
and
receives
them
kindly
asking
about
all
their
affairs
whatever
their
condition
may
be
he
is
a
great
ruler
and
a
man
of
much
justice
but
subject
to
sudden
fits
of
rage
and
this
is
his
title
crisnarao
macacao
king
of
kings
lord
of
the
greater
lords
of
india
lord
of
the
three
seas
and
of
the
land
he
has
this
title
because
he
is
by
rank
a
greater
lord
than
any
by
reason
of
what
he
possesses
in
armies
and
territories
but
it
seems
that
he
has
in
fact
nothing
compared
to
what
a
man
like
him
ought
to
have
so
gallant
and
perfect
is
he
in
all
things
this
king
was
constantly
at
war
with
the
king
of
orya
and
entered
his
kingdom
taking
and
destroying
many
cities
and
towns
he
put
to
rout
numbers
of
his
soldiers
and
elephants
and
took
captive
his
son
whom
he
kept
for
a
long
time
in
this
city
of
bisnaga
where
he
died
and
in
order
to
make
a
treaty
and
preserve
peace
the
king
of
orya
gave
him
a
daughter
whom
the
king
of
bisnaga
married
and
has
as
his
wife
this
king
has
twelve
lawful
wives
of
whom
there
are
three
principal
ones
the
sons
of
each
of
these
three
being
heirs
of
the
kingdom
but
not
these
of
the
others
this
is
the
case
when
there
are
sons
to
all
of
them
but
when
there
is
only
one
son
whosesoever
he
may
be
he
is
heir
one
of
these
principal
wives
is
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
orya
and
others
daughters
of
a
king
his
vassal
who
is
king
of
serimgapatao
another
wife
is
a
courtezan
whom
in
his
youth
he
had
for
mistress
before
he
became
king
and
she
made
him
promise
that
if
he
came
to
be
king
he
would
take
her
to
wife
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
this
courtezan
became
his
wife
for
love
of
her
he
built
this
new
city
and
its
name
was
sic
in
orig
each
one
of
these
wives
has
her
house
to
herself
with
her
maidens
and
women
of
the
chamber
and
women
guards
and
all
other
women
servants
necessary
all
these
are
women
and
no
man
enters
where
they
are
save
only
the
eunuchs
who
guard
them
these
women
are
never
seen
by
any
man
except
perhaps
by
some
old
man
of
high
rank
by
favour
of
the
king
when
they
wish
to
go
out
they
are
carried
in
litters
shut
up
and
closed
so
that
they
can
not
be
seen
and
all
the
eunuchs
with
them
fully
three
or
four
hundred
and
all
other
people
keep
a
long
distance
from
them
they
told
us
that
each
of
these
queens
has
a
very
large
sum
of
money
and
treasure
and
personal
ornaments
namely
armlets
bracelets
pearls
and
diamonds
and
that
in
great
quantity
and
they
also
say
that
each
of
them
has
sixty
maidens
adorned
as
richly
as
could
possibly
be
with
many
jewels
and
rubies
and
diamonds
and
pearls
and
these
we
afterwards
saw
and
stood
astonished
we
saw
them
at
certain
festivals
which
i
will
afterwards
speak
of
and
of
the
manner
in
which
they
came
within
with
these
maidens
they
say
that
there
are
twelve
thousand
women
for
you
must
know
that
there
are
women
who
handle
sword
and
shield
and
others
who
wrestle
and
others
who
blow
trumpets
and
others
pipes
and
others
instruments
which
are
different
from
ours
and
in
the
same
way
they
have
women
as
bearers
boois
and
and
for
other
offices
inside
their
gates
just
as
the
king
has
the
officers
of
his
household
these
three
principal
wives
have
each
the
same
one
as
much
as
the
other
so
that
there
may
never
be
any
discord
or
ill
feeling
between
them
all
of
them
are
great
friends
and
each
one
lives
by
herself
it
may
be
gathered
from
this
what
a
large
enclosure
there
must
be
for
these
houses
where
so
many
people
live
and
what
streets
and
lanes
they
must
have
the
king
lives
by
himself
inside
the
palace
and
when
he
wishes
to
have
with
him
one
of
his
wives
he
orders
a
eunuch
to
go
and
call
her
the
eunuch
does
not
enter
where
she
is
but
tells
it
to
the
female
guards
who
make
known
to
the
queen
that
there
is
a
message
from
the
king
and
then
comes
one
of
her
maidens
or
and
learns
what
is
wanted
and
then
the
queen
goes
where
the
king
is
or
the
king
comes
where
she
is
and
so
passes
the
time
as
it
seems
good
to
him
without
any
of
the
others
knowing
amongst
these
eunuchs
the
king
has
some
who
are
great
favourites
and
who
sleep
where
he
sleeps
they
receive
a
large
salary
this
king
is
accustomed
every
day
to
drink
quartilho
pint
of
oil
of
gingelly
before
daylight
and
anoints
himself
all
over
with
the
said
oil
he
covers
his
loins
with
a
small
cloth
and
takes
in
his
arms
great
weights
made
of
earthenware
and
then
taking
a
sword
he
exercises
himself
with
it
till
he
has
sweated
out
all
the
oil
and
then
he
wrestles
with
one
of
his
wrestlers
after
this
labour
he
mounts
a
horse
and
gallops
about
the
plain
in
one
direction
and
another
till
dawn
for
he
does
all
this
before
daybreak
then
he
goes
to
wash
himself
and
a
brahman
washes
him
whom
he
holds
sacred
and
who
is
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
is
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
after
he
is
washed
he
goes
to
where
his
pagoda
is
inside
the
palace
and
makes
his
orisons
and
ceremonies
according
to
custom
thence
he
goes
to
a
building
made
in
the
shape
of
a
porch
without
walls
which
has
many
pillars
hung
with
cloths
right
up
to
the
top
and
with
the
walls
handsomely
painted
it
has
on
each
side
two
figures
of
women
very
well
made
in
such
a
building
he
despatches
his
work
with
those
men
who
bear
office
in
his
kingdom
and
govern
his
cities
and
his
favourites
talk
with
them
the
greatest
favourite
is
an
old
man
called
temersea
he
commands
the
whole
household
and
to
him
all
the
great
lords
act
as
to
the
king
after
the
king
has
talked
with
these
men
on
subjects
pleasing
to
him
he
bids
enter
the
lords
and
captains
who
wait
at
the
gate
and
these
at
once
enter
to
make
their
salaam
to
him
as
soon
as
they
appear
they
make
their
salaam
to
him
and
place
themselves
along
the
walls
far
off
from
him
they
do
not
speak
one
to
another
nor
do
they
chew
betel
before
him
but
they
place
their
hands
in
the
sleeves
of
their
tunics
cabayas
and
cast
their
eyes
on
the
ground
and
if
the
king
desires
to
speak
to
any
one
it
is
done
through
a
second
person
and
then
he
to
whom
the
king
desires
to
speak
raises
his
eyes
and
replies
to
him
who
questions
him
and
then
returns
to
his
former
position
so
they
remain
till
the
king
bids
them
go
and
then
they
all
turn
to
make
the
salaam
to
him
and
go
out
the
salaam
which
is
the
greatest
courtesy
that
exists
among
them
is
that
they
put
their
hands
joined
above
their
head
as
high
as
they
can
every
day
they
go
to
make
the
salaam
to
the
king
when
we
came
to
this
country
the
king
was
in
this
new
town
and
there
went
to
see
him
christovao
de
figueiredo
with
all
of
us
portuguese
that
came
with
him
and
all
very
handsomely
dressed
after
our
manner
with
much
finery
the
king
received
him
very
well
and
was
very
complacent
to
him
the
king
was
as
much
pleased
with
him
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
his
own
people
so
much
attention
did
he
evince
towards
him
and
also
towards
those
amongst
us
who
went
with
him
he
showed
much
kindness
we
were
so
close
to
the
king
that
he
touched
us
all
and
could
not
have
enough
of
looking
at
us
then
christovao
de
figueiredo
gave
him
the
letters
from
the
and
the
things
he
had
brought
for
him
with
which
he
was
greatly
delighted
principally
with
certain
organs
that
the
said
christovao
de
figueiredo
brought
him
with
many
other
things
pecas
the
king
was
clothed
in
certain
white
cloths
embroidered
with
many
roses
in
gold
and
with
a
pateca
of
diamonds
on
his
neck
of
very
great
value
and
on
his
head
he
had
a
cap
of
brocade
in
fashion
like
a
galician
helmet
covered
with
a
piece
of
fine
stuff
all
of
fine
silk
and
he
was
barefooted
for
no
one
ever
enters
where
the
king
is
unless
he
has
bare
feet
and
the
majority
of
the
people
or
almost
all
go
about
the
country
barefooted
the
shoes
have
pointed
ends
in
the
ancient
manner
and
there
are
other
shoes
that
have
nothing
but
soles
but
on
top
are
some
straps
which
help
to
keep
them
on
the
feet
they
are
made
like
those
which
of
old
the
romans
were
wont
to
wear
as
you
will
find
on
figures
in
some
papers
or
antiquities
which
come
from
italy
the
king
gave
to
christovao
de
figueiredo
on
dismissing
him
a
cabaya
tunic
of
brocade
with
a
cap
of
the
same
fashion
as
the
king
wore
and
to
each
one
of
the
portuguese
he
gave
a
cloth
embroidered
with
many
pretty
figures
and
this
the
king
gives
because
it
is
customary
he
gives
it
in
token
of
friendship
and
love
when
christovao
de
figueiredo
had
been
dismissed
by
the
king
we
came
to
the
city
of
bisnaga
which
is
a
league
from
this
new
city
and
here
he
commanded
us
to
be
lodged
in
some
very
good
houses
and
figueiredo
was
visited
by
many
lords
and
captains
and
other
persons
who
came
on
behalf
of
the
king
and
the
king
sent
him
many
sheep
and
fowls
and
many
vessels
caloees
full
of
butter
and
honey
and
many
other
things
to
eat
which
he
at
once
distributed
amongst
all
the
and
people
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
the
king
said
many
kind
and
pleasant
things
to
him
and
asked
him
concerning
the
kind
of
state
which
the
king
of
portugal
kept
up
and
having
been
told
about
it
all
he
seemed
much
pleased
returning
then
to
the
city
of
bisnaga
you
must
know
that
from
it
to
the
new
city
goes
a
street
as
wide
as
a
place
of
tourney
with
both
sides
lined
throughout
with
rows
of
houses
and
shops
where
they
sell
everything
and
all
along
this
road
are
many
trees
that
the
king
commanded
to
be
planted
so
as
to
afford
shade
to
those
that
pass
along
on
this
road
he
commanded
to
be
erected
a
very
beautiful
temple
of
stone
and
there
are
other
pagodas
that
the
captains
and
great
lords
caused
to
be
erected
so
that
returning
to
the
city
of
bisnaga
you
must
know
that
before
you
arrive
at
the
city
gates
there
is
a
gate
with
a
wall
that
encloses
all
the
other
enclosures
of
the
city
and
this
wall
is
a
very
strong
one
and
of
massive
stonework
but
at
the
present
time
it
is
injured
in
some
places
they
do
not
fail
to
have
citadels
in
it
this
wall
has
a
moat
of
water
in
some
places
and
in
the
parts
where
it
was
constructed
on
low
ground
and
there
is
separate
from
it
yet
another
defence
made
in
the
following
manner
certain
pointed
stones
of
great
height
are
fixed
in
the
ground
as
high
as
a
man
breast
they
are
in
breadth
a
and
a
half
with
the
same
distance
between
them
and
the
great
wall
this
wall
rises
in
all
the
low
ground
till
it
reaches
some
hill
or
rocky
land
from
this
first
circuit
until
you
enter
the
city
there
is
a
great
distance
in
which
are
fields
in
which
they
sow
rice
and
have
many
gardens
and
much
water
which
water
comes
from
two
lakes
the
water
passes
through
this
first
line
of
wall
and
there
is
much
water
in
the
lakes
because
of
springs
and
here
there
are
orchards
and
a
little
grove
of
palms
and
many
houses
returning
then
to
the
first
gate
of
the
city
before
you
arrive
at
it
you
pass
a
little
piece
of
water
and
then
you
arrive
at
the
wall
which
is
very
strong
all
of
stonework
and
it
makes
a
bend
before
you
arrive
at
the
gate
and
at
the
entrance
of
this
gate
are
two
towers
one
on
each
side
which
makes
it
very
strong
it
is
large
and
beautiful
as
soon
as
you
pass
inside
there
are
two
little
temples
one
of
them
has
an
enclosing
wall
with
many
trees
while
the
whole
of
the
other
consists
of
buildings
and
this
wall
of
the
first
gate
encircles
the
whole
city
then
going
forward
you
have
another
gate
with
another
line
of
wall
and
it
also
encircles
the
city
inside
the
first
and
from
here
to
the
king
palace
is
all
streets
and
rows
of
houses
very
beautiful
and
houses
of
captains
and
other
rich
and
honourable
men
you
will
see
rows
of
houses
with
many
figures
and
decorations
pleasing
to
look
at
going
along
the
principal
street
you
have
one
of
the
chief
gateways
which
issues
from
a
great
open
space
in
front
of
the
king
palace
opposite
this
is
another
which
passes
along
to
the
other
side
of
the
city
and
across
this
open
space
pass
all
the
carts
and
conveyances
carrying
stores
and
everything
else
and
because
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
city
it
can
not
but
be
useful
this
palace
of
the
king
is
surrounded
by
a
very
strong
wall
like
some
of
the
others
and
encloses
a
greater
space
teraa
moor
cerca
than
all
the
castle
of
lisbon
still
going
forward
passing
to
the
other
gate
you
see
two
temples
connected
with
it
one
on
each
side
and
at
the
door
of
one
of
these
they
kill
every
day
many
sheep
for
in
all
the
city
they
do
not
kill
any
sheep
for
the
use
of
the
heathen
hindus
or
for
sale
in
the
markets
except
at
the
gate
of
this
pagoda
of
their
blood
they
make
sacrifices
to
the
idol
that
is
in
the
temple
they
leave
the
heads
to
him
and
for
each
sheep
they
give
a
saco
chakram
which
is
a
coin
like
a
cartilha
quartilha
a
farthing
there
is
present
at
the
slaughter
of
these
beasts
a
jogi
priest
who
has
charge
of
the
temple
and
as
soon
as
they
cut
off
the
head
of
the
sheep
or
goat
this
jogi
blows
a
horn
as
a
sign
that
the
idol
receives
that
sacrifice
hereafter
i
shall
tell
of
these
jogis
what
sort
of
men
they
are
close
to
these
pagodas
is
a
triumphal
car
covered
with
carved
work
and
images
and
on
one
day
in
each
year
during
a
festival
they
drag
this
through
the
city
in
such
streets
as
it
can
traverse
it
is
large
and
can
not
turn
corners
going
forward
you
have
a
broad
and
beautiful
street
full
of
rows
of
fine
houses
and
streets
of
the
sort
i
have
described
and
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
houses
belong
to
men
rich
enough
to
afford
such
in
this
street
live
many
merchants
and
there
you
will
find
all
sorts
of
rubies
and
diamonds
and
emeralds
and
pearls
and
and
cloths
and
every
other
sort
of
thing
there
is
on
earth
and
that
you
may
wish
to
buy
then
you
have
there
every
evening
a
fair
where
they
sell
many
common
horses
and
nags
rocis
e
semdeiros
and
also
many
citrons
and
limes
and
oranges
and
grapes
and
every
other
kind
of
garden
stuff
and
wood
you
have
all
in
this
street
at
the
end
of
it
you
have
another
gate
with
its
wall
which
wall
goes
to
meet
the
wall
of
the
second
gate
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
such
sort
that
this
city
has
three
fortresses
with
another
which
is
the
king
palace
then
when
this
gate
is
passed
you
have
another
street
where
there
are
many
craftsmen
and
they
sell
many
things
and
in
this
street
there
are
two
small
temples
there
are
temples
in
every
street
for
these
appertain
to
institutions
like
the
confraternities
you
know
of
in
our
parts
of
all
the
craftsmen
and
merchants
but
the
principal
and
greatest
pagodas
are
outside
the
city
in
this
street
lodged
christovao
de
figueiredo
on
every
friday
you
have
a
fair
there
with
many
pigs
and
fowls
and
dried
fish
from
the
sea
and
other
things
the
produce
of
the
country
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
name
and
in
like
manner
a
fair
is
held
every
day
in
different
parts
of
the
city
at
the
end
of
this
street
is
the
moorish
quarter
which
is
at
the
very
end
of
the
city
and
of
these
moors
there
are
many
who
are
natives
of
the
country
and
who
are
paid
by
the
king
and
belong
to
his
guard
in
this
city
you
will
find
men
belonging
to
every
nation
and
people
because
of
the
great
trade
which
it
has
and
the
many
precious
stones
there
principally
diamonds
the
size
of
this
city
i
do
not
write
here
because
it
can
not
all
be
seen
from
any
one
spot
but
i
climbed
a
hill
whence
i
could
see
a
great
part
of
it
i
could
not
see
it
all
because
it
lies
between
several
ranges
of
hills
what
i
saw
from
thence
seemed
to
me
as
large
as
rome
and
very
beautiful
to
the
sight
there
are
many
groves
of
trees
within
it
in
the
gardens
of
the
houses
and
many
conduits
of
water
which
flow
into
the
midst
of
it
and
in
places
there
are
lakes
tamques
and
the
king
has
close
to
his
palace
a
and
other
below
the
moorish
quarter
is
a
little
river
and
on
this
side
are
many
orchards
and
gardens
with
many
for
the
most
part
mangoes
and
and
and
also
many
lime
and
orange
trees
growing
so
closely
one
to
another
that
it
appears
like
a
thick
forest
and
there
are
also
white
grapes
all
the
water
which
is
in
the
city
comes
from
the
two
tanks
of
which
i
have
spoken
outside
the
first
enclosing
wall
the
people
in
this
city
are
countless
in
number
so
much
so
that
i
do
not
wish
to
write
it
down
for
fear
it
should
be
thought
fabulous
but
i
declare
that
no
troops
horse
or
foot
could
break
their
way
through
any
street
or
lane
so
great
are
the
numbers
of
the
people
and
elephants
this
is
the
best
provided
city
in
the
world
and
is
stocked
with
provisions
such
as
rice
wheat
grains
and
a
certain
amount
of
barley
and
beans
moong
pulses
and
many
other
seeds
which
grow
in
this
country
which
are
the
food
of
the
people
and
there
is
large
store
of
these
and
very
cheap
but
wheat
is
not
so
common
as
the
other
grains
since
no
one
eats
it
except
the
moors
but
you
will
find
what
i
have
mentioned
the
streets
and
markets
are
full
of
laden
oxen
without
count
so
that
you
can
not
get
along
for
them
and
in
many
streets
you
come
upon
so
many
of
them
that
you
have
to
wait
for
them
to
pass
or
else
have
to
go
by
another
way
there
is
much
poultry
they
give
three
fowls
in
the
city
for
a
coin
worth
a
vintem
which
coins
are
called
favaos
outside
the
city
they
give
four
fowls
for
a
vintem
in
this
country
there
are
many
partridges
but
they
are
not
of
the
same
sort
or
quality
as
ours
they
are
like
the
estarnas
of
italy
there
are
three
sorts
of
these
one
class
has
only
a
small
spur
such
as
those
of
portugal
have
another
class
has
on
each
foot
two
very
sharp
spurs
almost
as
long
and
thick
as
one
finger
the
other
class
is
painted
and
of
these
you
will
find
the
markets
full
as
also
of
quails
and
hares
and
all
kinds
of
wild
fowl
and
other
birds
which
live
in
the
lakes
and
which
look
like
geese
all
these
birds
and
game
animals
they
sell
alive
and
they
are
very
cheap
for
they
give
six
or
eight
partridges
for
a
vintem
and
of
hares
they
give
two
and
sometimes
one
of
other
birds
they
give
more
than
you
can
count
for
even
of
the
large
ones
they
give
so
many
that
you
would
hardly
pay
any
attention
to
the
little
ones
they
give
you
such
as
doves
and
pigeons
and
the
common
birds
of
the
country
the
doves
are
of
two
kinds
some
are
like
those
in
portugal
others
are
as
large
as
thrushes
of
the
doves
they
give
twelve
or
fourteen
for
a
favao
the
pigeons
are
the
same
price
as
the
other
birds
then
the
sheep
that
they
kill
every
day
are
countless
one
could
not
number
them
for
in
every
street
there
are
men
who
will
sell
you
mutton
so
clean
and
so
fat
that
it
looks
like
pork
and
you
also
have
pigs
in
some
streets
of
butchers
houses
so
white
and
clean
that
you
could
never
see
better
in
any
country
a
pig
is
worth
four
or
five
fanams
then
to
see
the
many
loads
of
limes
that
come
each
day
such
that
those
of
povos
are
of
no
account
and
also
loads
of
sweet
and
sour
oranges
and
wild
brinjals
and
other
garden
stuff
in
such
abundance
as
to
stupefy
one
for
the
state
of
this
city
is
not
like
that
of
other
cities
which
often
fail
of
supplies
and
provisions
for
in
this
one
everything
abounds
and
also
the
quantity
of
butter
and
oil
and
milk
sold
every
day
that
is
a
thing
i
can
not
refrain
from
mentioning
and
as
for
the
rearing
of
cows
and
buffaloes
which
goes
on
in
the
city
there
is
so
much
that
you
will
go
very
far
before
you
find
another
like
it
there
are
many
pomegranates
also
grapes
are
sold
at
three
bunches
a
fanam
and
pomegranates
ten
for
a
fanam
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
is
a
very
great
river
with
much
water
in
which
are
many
fish
which
fish
are
very
unwholesome
and
in
this
river
there
is
that
which
passes
for
sic
in
orig
other
streams
flow
into
it
which
make
it
very
large
now
as
to
the
places
on
the
bank
of
this
river
there
is
a
city
built
there
which
they
call
senagumdym
and
they
say
that
of
old
it
was
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
but
there
now
live
in
it
few
people
it
still
has
good
walls
and
is
very
strong
and
it
lies
between
two
which
have
only
two
entrances
a
captain
lives
in
this
city
for
the
king
people
cross
to
this
place
by
boats
which
are
round
like
baskets
inside
they
are
made
of
cane
and
outside
are
covered
with
leather
they
are
able
to
carry
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
and
even
horses
and
oxen
can
cross
in
them
if
necessary
but
for
the
most
part
these
animals
swim
across
men
row
them
with
a
sort
of
paddle
and
the
boats
are
always
turning
round
as
they
can
not
go
straight
like
others
in
all
the
kingdom
where
there
are
streams
there
are
no
other
boats
but
these
there
are
also
in
this
city
places
where
they
sell
live
sheep
you
will
see
the
fields
round
the
city
full
of
them
and
also
of
cows
and
buffaloes
it
is
a
very
pretty
sight
to
see
and
also
the
many
and
kids
and
the
so
large
that
they
are
bridled
and
saddled
many
sheep
are
like
that
also
and
boys
ride
them
outside
the
city
walls
on
the
north
there
are
three
very
beautiful
pagodas
one
of
which
is
called
vitella
and
it
stands
over
against
this
city
of
nagumdym
the
other
is
called
aoperadianar
and
this
is
the
one
which
they
hold
in
most
veneration
and
to
which
they
make
great
pilgrimages
in
this
pagoda
opposite
to
its
principal
gate
which
is
to
the
east
there
is
a
very
beautiful
street
of
very
beautiful
houses
with
balconies
and
arcades
in
which
are
sheltered
the
pilgrims
that
come
to
it
and
there
are
also
houses
for
the
lodging
of
the
upper
classes
the
king
has
a
palace
in
the
same
street
in
which
he
resides
when
he
visits
this
pagoda
there
is
a
pomegranate
tree
above
this
first
gate
the
gate
has
a
very
lofty
tower
all
covered
with
rows
of
men
and
women
and
hunting
scenes
and
many
other
representations
and
as
the
tower
goes
narrowing
towards
the
top
so
the
images
diminish
in
size
passing
this
first
gate
you
come
at
once
into
a
large
courtyard
with
another
gate
of
the
same
sort
as
the
first
except
that
it
is
rather
smaller
throughout
and
passing
this
second
gate
there
is
a
large
court
with
verandahs
all
round
on
pillars
of
stone
and
in
the
middle
of
this
court
is
the
house
of
the
idol
opposite
the
principal
gate
stand
four
columns
two
gilded
and
the
other
two
copper
from
which
owing
to
their
great
age
as
it
seems
to
me
the
gold
has
worn
off
and
the
other
two
are
also
of
copper
for
all
are
of
copper
that
which
stands
nearest
the
gate
of
the
temple
was
given
by
this
king
crisnarao
who
now
reigns
here
and
the
others
by
his
predecessors
all
the
outer
side
of
the
gate
of
the
temple
up
to
the
roof
is
covered
with
copper
and
gilded
and
on
each
side
of
the
roof
on
the
top
are
certain
great
animals
that
look
like
tigers
all
gilt
as
soon
as
you
enter
this
you
perceive
from
pillar
to
pillar
on
which
it
is
supported
many
little
holes
in
which
stand
oil
lamps
which
burn
so
they
tell
me
every
night
and
they
will
be
in
number
two
thousand
five
hundred
or
three
thousand
lights
as
soon
as
you
pass
this
shrine
you
enter
another
small
one
like
the
crypt
cinzeyro
of
some
church
it
has
two
doors
at
the
sides
and
thence
onward
this
building
is
like
a
chapel
where
stands
the
idol
which
they
adore
before
you
get
to
it
there
are
three
doors
the
shrine
is
vaulted
and
dark
without
any
light
from
the
sky
it
is
always
lit
with
candles
at
the
first
gate
are
doorkeepers
who
never
allow
any
one
to
enter
except
the
brahmans
that
have
charge
of
it
and
i
because
i
gave
something
to
them
was
allowed
to
enter
between
gate
and
gate
are
images
of
little
idols
the
principal
idol
is
a
round
stone
without
any
shape
they
have
great
devotion
for
it
this
building
outside
is
all
covered
with
copper
gilt
at
the
back
of
the
temple
outside
close
to
the
verandahs
of
which
i
have
spoken
there
is
a
small
idol
of
white
alabaster
with
six
arms
in
one
it
has
a
and
in
the
other
a
sword
and
in
the
others
sacred
emblems
armas
de
casa
and
it
has
below
its
feet
a
buffalo
and
a
large
animal
which
is
helping
to
kill
that
buffalo
in
this
pagoda
there
burns
continually
a
lamp
of
ghee
and
around
are
other
small
temples
for
houses
of
devotion
the
other
temples
aforesaid
are
made
in
the
same
manner
but
this
one
is
the
principal
one
and
the
oldest
they
all
have
many
buildings
and
gardens
with
many
trees
in
which
the
brahmans
cultivate
their
vegetables
and
the
other
herbs
that
they
eat
whenever
the
festival
of
any
of
these
temples
occurs
they
drag
along
certain
triumphal
cars
which
run
on
wheels
and
with
it
go
and
other
women
with
music
to
the
temple
conducting
the
idol
along
the
said
street
with
much
pomp
i
do
not
relate
the
manner
in
which
these
cars
are
taken
because
in
all
the
time
that
i
was
in
this
city
none
were
taken
round
there
are
many
other
temples
in
the
city
of
which
i
do
not
here
speak
to
avoid
prolixity
you
should
know
that
among
these
heathen
there
are
days
when
they
celebrate
their
feasts
as
with
us
and
they
have
their
days
of
fasting
when
all
day
they
eat
nothing
and
eat
only
at
midnight
when
the
time
of
the
principal
festival
arrives
the
king
comes
from
the
new
city
to
this
city
of
bisnaga
since
it
is
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
and
it
is
the
custom
there
to
make
their
feasts
and
to
assemble
for
these
feasts
are
summoned
all
the
of
the
kingdom
in
order
that
they
should
be
present
and
also
the
captains
and
kings
and
great
lords
with
all
their
retinues
except
only
those
whom
the
king
may
have
sent
to
make
war
or
those
who
are
in
other
parts
or
at
the
far
end
of
the
kingdom
on
the
side
where
an
attack
is
feared
such
as
the
kingdom
of
oria
and
the
territories
of
the
ydallcao
and
even
if
such
captains
are
absent
in
such
places
there
appear
for
them
at
the
feasts
those
whom
i
shall
hereafter
mention
these
feasts
begin
on
the
of
september
and
they
last
nine
days
and
take
place
at
the
king
palace
the
palace
is
on
this
fashion
it
has
a
gate
opening
on
to
the
open
space
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
over
this
gate
is
a
tower
of
some
height
made
like
the
others
with
its
verandahs
outside
these
gates
begins
the
wall
which
i
said
encircled
the
palace
at
the
gate
are
many
doorkeepers
with
leather
scourges
in
their
hands
and
sticks
and
they
let
no
one
enter
but
the
captains
and
chief
people
and
those
about
whom
they
receive
orders
from
the
chief
of
the
guard
passing
this
gate
you
have
an
open
space
and
then
you
have
another
gate
like
the
first
also
with
its
doorkeepers
and
guards
and
as
soon
as
you
enter
inside
this
you
have
a
large
open
space
and
on
one
side
and
the
other
are
low
verandahs
where
are
seated
the
captains
and
chief
people
in
order
to
witness
the
feasts
and
on
the
left
side
of
the
north
of
this
open
space
is
a
great
building
terrea
all
the
rest
are
like
it
this
building
stands
on
pillars
shaped
like
elephants
and
with
other
figures
and
all
open
in
front
and
they
go
up
to
it
by
staircases
of
stone
around
it
underneath
is
a
terrace
corredor
paved
with
very
good
flagstones
where
stand
some
of
the
people
looking
at
the
feast
this
house
is
called
the
house
of
victory
as
it
was
made
when
the
king
came
back
from
the
war
against
orya
as
i
have
already
told
you
on
the
right
side
of
the
open
space
were
some
narrow
scaffoldings
made
of
wood
and
so
lofty
that
they
could
be
seen
over
the
top
of
the
wall
they
were
covered
at
the
top
with
crimson
and
green
velvet
and
other
handsome
cloths
and
adorned
from
top
to
bottom
let
no
one
fancy
that
these
cloths
were
of
wool
because
there
are
none
such
in
the
country
but
they
are
of
very
fine
cotton
these
scaffoldings
are
not
always
kept
at
that
place
but
they
are
specially
made
for
these
feasts
there
are
eleven
of
them
against
the
gates
there
were
two
circles
in
which
were
the
richly
arrayed
with
many
jewels
of
gold
and
diamonds
and
many
pearls
opposite
the
gate
which
is
on
the
east
side
of
the
front
of
the
open
space
and
in
the
middle
of
it
there
are
two
buildings
of
the
same
sort
as
the
house
of
victory
of
which
i
have
spoken
these
buildings
are
served
by
a
kind
of
staircase
of
stone
beautifully
wrought
one
is
in
the
middle
and
the
other
at
the
end
this
building
was
all
hung
with
rich
cloths
both
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
as
well
as
the
supports
and
the
cloths
of
the
walls
were
adorned
with
figures
in
the
manner
of
embroidery
these
buildings
have
two
platforms
one
above
the
other
beautifully
sculptured
with
their
sides
well
made
and
worked
to
which
platforms
the
sons
of
the
king

the
feasts
and
sometimes
his
eunuchs

the
streets
that
are
in
the
palace
i
here
mention
them

must
know
that
inside
the
palace
that
i
have
spoken
of
is
the
dwelling
of
the
king
and
of
his
wives
and
of
the
other
women
who
serve
them
as
i
have
already
said
who
are
twelve
thousand
in
number
and
they
have
an
entrance
to
these
rows
of
houses
so
that
they
can
go
inside
between
this
palace
and
the
house
of
victory
is
a
gate
which
serves
as
passage
to
it
inside
there
are
streets
returning
to
the
feasts

that
in
this
house
of
victory
the

a

in
the
other
in

of
the
building
is

brahmans
and
he
performs
his
prayers
and
ceremonies
outside
the
house
are
some
of
his
favourites
and
on
the
square
are
many
dancing
in
their
verandahs
round
the
square
are
many
captains
and
chief
people
who
come
there
in
order
to
see
and
on
the
ground
near
the
platform
of
the
house
are
eleven
horses
with
handsome
and
trappings
and
behind
them
are
four
beautiful
elephants
with
many
adornments
after
the
king
has
entered
inside
he
comes
out
and
with
him
a
brahman
who
takes
in
his
hand
a
basket
full
of
white
roses
and
approaches
the
king
on
the
platform
and
the
king
taking
three
handfuls
of
these
roses
throws
them
to
the
horses
and
after
he
has
thrown
them
he
takes
a
basket
of
perfumes
and
acts
towards
them
as
though
he
would
cense
them
and
when
he
has
finished
doing
this
he
reaches
towards
the
elephants
and
does
the
same
to
them
and
when
the
king
has
finished
this
the
brahman
takes
the
basket
and
descends
to
the
platform
and
from
thence
puts
those
roses
and
other
flowers
on
the
heads
of
all
the
horses
and
this
done
returns
to
the
king
then
the
king
goes
again
to
where
the
idol
is
and
as
soon
as
he
is
inside
they
lift
the
curtains
of
the
room
which
are
made
like
the
purdahs
of
a
tent
and
the
king
seats
himself
there
where
these
are
and
they
lift
them
all
thence
he
witnesses
the
slaughter
of
buffaloes
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
sheep
with
which
a
sacrifice
is
made
to
that
idol
you
must
know
that
they
cut
off
the
heads
of
these
buffaloes
and
sheep
at
one
blow
with
certain
large
sickles
which
are
wielded
by
a
man
who
has
charge
of
this
slaughter
they
are
so
sure
of
hand
that
no
blow
misses
when
they
have
finished
the
slaughter
of
these
cattle
the
king
goes
out
and
goes
to
the
other
large
buildings
on
the
platforms
of
which
is
a
crowd
of
brahmans
and
as
soon
as
the
king
ascends
to
where
they
stand
they
throw
to
the
king
ten
or
twelve
roses
those
that
is
who
are
nearest
to
him
then
he
passes
all
along
the
top
of
the
buildings
and
as
soon
as
he
is
at
the
end
he
takes
the
cap
from
his
head
and
after
placing
it
on
the
ground
turns
back
to
the
place
where
the
idol
is
here
he
lies
extended
on
the
ground
when
he
has
arisen
he
betakes
himself
to
the
interior
of
the
building
and
enters
a
garden
or
walled
enclosure
quyntal
where
they
say
that
a
little
fire
has
been
made
and
he
throws
into
the
fire
a
powder
made
up
of
many
things
namely
rubies
and
pearls
and
all
other
kinds
of
precious
stones
and
aloes
and
other
things
this
done
he
returns
to
the
pagoda
and
goes
inside
and
stays
a
little
at
which
time
enter
by
the
other
door
some
of
his
favourites
who
are
in
the
building
and
they
make
their
salaam
then
he
goes
back
to
the
place
whence
he
threw
the
flowers
to
the
horses
and
as
soon
as
he
is
here
all
the
captains
and
chief
people
come
and
make
their
salaam
to
him
and
some
if
they
so
desire
present
some
gifts
to
him
then
as
they
came
so
they
retire
and
each
one
betakes
himself
to
his
own
dwelling
and
the
king
withdraws
to
the
interior
of
his
palace
by
that
gate
which
i
have
already
mentioned
that
which
stands
between
the
two
buildings
that
are
in
the
arena
terreyro
the
courtesans
and
bayaderes
remain
dancing
in
front
of
the
temple
and
idol
for
a
long
time
this
is
what
is
done
during
the
morning
of
each
day
of
these
nine
days
with
the
ceremonies
i
have
mentioned
and
each
day
more
splendid
than
the
last
now
returning
to
the
feasts
at
three
in
the
afternoon
every
one
comes
to
the
palace
they
do
not
admit
every
one
at
once
they
allowed
us
to
go
into
the
open
part
that
is
between
the
gates
but
there
go
inside
only
the
wrestlers
and
and
the
elephants
which
go
with
their
trappings
and
decorations
those
that
sit
on
them
being
armed
with
shields
and
javelins
and
wearing
quilted
tunics
as
soon
as
these
are
inside
they
range
themselves
round
the
arena
each
one
in
his
place
and
the
wrestlers
go
close
to
the
staircase
which
is
in
the
middle
of
that
building
where
has
been
prepared
a
large
space
of
ground
for
the
to
wrestle
many
other
people
are
then
at
the
opposite
to
the
building
namely
brahmans
and
the
sons
of
the
king
favourites
and
their
relations
all
these
are
noble
youths
who
serve
before
the
king
the
officers
of
the
household
go
about
keeping
order
amongst
all
the
people
and
keep
each
one
in
his
own
place
the
different
pavilions
are
separated
by
doors
so
that
no
one
may
enter
unless
he
is
invited
salvatinica
who
is
the
principal
person
that
enters
the
building
supervises
the
whole
for
he
brought
up
the
king
and
made
him
king
and
so
the
king
looks
on
him
like
a
father
whenever
the
king
calls
to
him
he
addresses
him
as
lord
senhor
salvatinica
and
all
the
captains
and
nobles
of
the
realm
make
salaam
to
him
this
salvatinica
stands
inside
the
arena
where
the
festivals
go
on
near
one
of
the
doors
and
from
there
gives
the
word
for
the
admission
of
all
the
things
necessary
for
the
festival
after
all
this
is
done
and
arranged
the
king
goes
forth
and
seats
himself
on
the
dais
i
have
mentioned
where
is
the
throne
and
the
other
things
and
all
those
that
are
inside
make
their
salaam
to
him
as
soon
as
they
have
done
this
the
wrestlers
seat
themselves
on
the
ground
for
these
are
allowed
to
remain
seated
but
no
other
howsoever
great
a
lord
he
be
except
the
king
so
commands
and
these
also
eat
betel
though
none
else
may
eat
it
in
his
presence
except
the
who
may
always
eat
it
before
him
as
soon
as
the
king
is
seated
in
his
place
he
bids
to
sit
with
him
three
or
four
men
who
belong
to
his
race
and
who
are
themselves
kings
and
the
fathers
of
his
wives
the
principal
of
these
is
the
king
of
syrimgapatao
and
of
all
the
territory
bordering
on
malabar
and
this
king
is
called
cumarvirya
and
he
seats
himself
as
far
in
front
as
the
king
on
the
other
side
of
the
dais
the
rest
are
behind
there
the
king
sits
dressed
in
white
clothes
all
covered
with
embroidery
of
golden
roses
and
wearing
his
jewels
he
wears
a
quantity
of
these
white
garments
and
i
always
saw
him
so
dressed
and
around
him
stand
his
pages
with
his
betel
and
his
sword
and
the
other
things
which
are
his
insignia
of
state
many
brahmans
stand
round
the
throne
on
which
rests
the
idol
fanning
it
with
horsetail
plumes
coloured
the
handles
of
which
are
all
overlaid
with
gold
these
plumes
are
tokens
of
the
highest
dignity
they
also
fan
the
king
with
them
as
soon
as
the
king
is
seated
the
captains
who
waited
without
make
their
entrance
each
one
by
himself
attended
by
his
chief
people
and
so
on
all
in
order
they
approach
and
make
their
salaams
to
the
king
and
then
take
their
places
in
the
pavilions
veramdas
which
i
have
previously
described
as
soon
as
these
nobles
have
finished
entering
the
captains
of
the
troops
approach
with
shields
and
spears
and
afterwards
the
captains
of
the
archers
these
officers
are
all
stationed
on
the
ground
around
the
arena
in
front
of
the
elephants
and
they
constitute
the
king
guard
for
into
such
a
place
no
man
may
enter
bearing
arms
nor
near
to
where
the
king
is
as
soon
as
these
soldiers
have
all
taken
their
places
the
women
begin
to
dance
while
some
of
them
place
themselves
in
the
circular
galleries
that
i
have
said
were
erected
at
their
gate
of
entrance
who
can
fitly
describe
to
you
the
great
riches
these
women
carry
on
their
persons
collars
of
gold
with
so
many
diamonds
and
rubies
and
pearls
bracelets
also
on
their
arms
and
on
their
upper
arms
girdles
below
and
of
necessity
anklets
on
the
feet
the
marvel
should
be
otherwise
namely
that
women
of
such
a
profession
should
obtain
such
wealth
but
there
are
women
among
them
who
have
lands
that
have
been
given
to
them
and
litters
and
so
many
that
one
can
not
number
all
their
things
there
is
a
woman
in
this
city
who
is
said
to
have
a
hundred
thousand
pardaos
and
i
believe
this
from
what
i
have
seen
of
them
then
the
wrestlers
begin
their
play
their
wrestling
does
not
seem
like
ours
but
there
are
blows
given
so
severe
as
to
break
teeth
and
put
out
eyes
and
disfigure
faces
so
much
so
that
here
and
there
men
are
carried
off
speechless
by
their
friends
they
give
one
another
fine
falls
too
they
have
their
captains
and
judges
who
are
there
to
put
each
one
on
an
equal
footing
in
the
field
and
also
to
adjust
the
honours
to
him
who
wins
in
all
this
portion
of
the
day
nothing
more
is
done
than
this
wrestling
and
the
dancing
of
the
women
but
as
soon
as
ever
the
sun
is
down
many
torches
are
lit
and
some
great
flambeaux
made
of
cloth
and
these
are
placed
about
the
arena
in
such
a
way
that
the
whole
is
as
light
as
day
and
even
along
the
top
of
the
walls
for
on
all
the
battlements
are
lighted
lamps
and
the
place
where
the
king
sits
is
all
full
of
torches
as
soon
as
these
are
all
lit
up
there
are
introduced
many
very
graceful
plays
and
contrivances
but
these
do
not
stop
long
they
only
approach
where
the
king
is
and
then
go
out
then
there
enter
others
in
other
fashion
with
battles
of
people
on
horseback
these
horses
are
like
the
made
in
portugal
for
the
feast
of
the
corpo
de
dios
others
come
with
fishing
and
capturing
the
men
that
are
in
the
arena
when
these
amusements
are
ended
they
begin
to
throw
up
many
rockets
and
many
different
sorts
of
fires
also
castles
that
burn
and
fling
out
from
themselves
many
bombs
tiros
and
rockets
when
these
fireworks
are
finished
there
enter
many
triumphal
cars
which
belong
to
the
captains
some
of
them
sent
by
those
captains
who
are
waging
war
in
foreign
parts
and
they
enter
thus
the
first
belongs
to
salvatinica
and
they
come
in
one
after
the
other
some
of
the
cars
appear
covered
with
many
rich
cloths
having
on
them
many
devices
of
and
other
human
figures
there
are
other
cars
having
tiers
one
on
top
of
another
and
others
all
of
one
kind
and
so
in
their
order
they
pass
to
where
the
king
is
when
the
cars
have
gone
out
they
are
immediately
followed
by
many
horses
covered
with
trappings
and
cloths
of
very
fine
stuff
of
the
king
colours
and
with
many
roses
and
flowers
on
their
heads
and
necks
and
with
their
bridles
all
gilded
and
in
front
of
these
horses
goes
a
horse
with
two
of
the
king
and
with
grander
decorations
than
the
others
and
one
of
the
lesser
equerries
leads
it
by
the
bridle
in
front
of
this
horse
goes
another
caracoling
and
prancing
as
do
all
horses
here
being
trained
in
that
art
you
must
know
that
this
horse
that
is
conducted
with
all
this
state
is
a
horse
that
the
king
keeps
on
which
they
are
sworn
and
received
as
kings
and
on
it
must
be
sworn
all
those
that
shall
come
after
them
and
in
case
such
a
horse
dies
they
put
another
in
its
place
if
any
king
does
not
wish
to
be
sworn
on
horseback
they
swear
him
on
an
elephant
which
they
keep
and
treat
with
equal
dignity
these
horses
then
going
in
the
way
i
have
stated
pass
twice
round
the
arena
and
place
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
in
five
or
six
lines
one
before
the
other
and
the
king
horse
in
front
of
them
all
facing
the
king
they
stand
in
such
a
way
that
between
them
and
the
men
there
is
an
open
space
all
round
as
soon
as
they
are
arranged
in
this
way
and
are
all
quiet
there
goes
out
from
the
inside
of
the
palace
a
brahman
the
highest
in
rank
of
those
about
the
king
and
two
others
with
him
and
this
chief
brahman
carries
in
his
hands
a
bowl
with
a
cocoanut
and
some
rice
and
flowers
while
others
carry
a
pot
of
water
and
they
pass
round
by
the
back
of
the
horses
which
all
stand
facing
the
king
and
after
performing
his
ceremonies
there
he
returns
to
the
palace
after
this
is
over
you
will
see
issuing
from
inside
or
thirty
female
doorkeepers
with
canes
in
their
hands
and
whips
on
their
shoulders
and
then
close
to
these
come
many
eunuchs
and
after
these
eunuchs
come
many
women
playing
many
trumpets
and
drums
and
pipes
but
not
like
ours
and
viols
and
many
other
kinds
of
music
and
behind
these
women
will
come
some
twenty
with
canes
in
their
hands
all
covered
with
silver
and
close
to
them
come
women
clothed
in
the
following
manner
they
have
very
rich
and
fine
silk
cloths
on
the
head
they
wear
high
caps
which
they
call
collaes
and
on
these
caps
they
wear
flowers
made
of
large
pearls
collars
on
the
neck
with
jewels
of
gold
very
richly
set
with
many
emeralds
and
diamonds
and
rubies
and
pearls
and
besides
this
many
strings
of
pearls
and
others
for
on
the
lower
part
of
the
arms
many
bracelets
with
half
of
the
upper
arm
all
bare
having
armlets
in
the
same
way
all
of
precious
stones
on
the
waist
many
girdles
of
gold
and
of
precious
stones
which
girdles
hang
in
order
one
below
the
other
almost
as
far
down
as
half
the
thigh
besides
these
belts
they
have
other
jewels
and
many
strings
of
pearls
round
the
ankles
for
they
wear
very
rich
anklets
even
of
greater
value
than
the
rest
they
carry
in
their
hands
vessels
of
gold
each
as
large
as
a
small
cask
of
water
inside
these
are
some
loops
made
of
pearls
fastened
with
wax
and
inside
all
this
a
lighted
lamp
they
come
in
regular
order
one
before
the
other
in
all
perhaps
sixty
women
fair
and
young
from
sixteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
who
is
he
that
could
tell
of
the
costliness
and
the
value
of
what
each
of
these
women
carries
on
her
person
so
great
is
the
weight
of
the
bracelets
and
gold
and
jewels
carried
by
them
that
many
of
them
can
not
support
them
and
women
accompany
them
assisting
them
by
supporting
their
arms
in
this
manner
and
in
this
array
they
proceed
three
times
round
the
horses
and
at
the
end
retire
into
the
palace
these
women
are
maids
of
honour
to
the
queens
and
so
are
the
others
that
go
with
them
on
each
day
of
these
nine
days
of
the
feast
one
of
the
queens
sends
each
on
her
own
day
her
ladies
with
the
others
the
officials
in
honour
of
the
feast
have
the
days
divided
between
them
in
accordance
with
their
custom
as
already
arranged
by
the
king
and
these
women
come
every
day
most
richly
attired
taking
pleasure
in
strewing
themselves
in
such
things
and
in
making
a
display
each
one
of
what
she
possesses
when
these
women
retire
the
horses
also
go
and
then
come
the
elephants
and
after
making
their
salaam
they
too
retire
as
soon
as
they
are
gone
the
king
retires
by
a
small
door
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
building
then
the
brahmans
go
and
take
an
idol
and
carry
it
to
the
house
of
victory
where
is
the
room
of
cloth
that
i
have
spoken
of
and
the
king
at
once
comes
from
within
and
goes
to
where
the
idol
is
and
offers
his
prayers
and
performs
his
ceremonies
then
they
bring
there
more
buffaloes
and
sheep
and
kill
them
in
the
same
way
as
before
and
then
come
the
professional
women
to
dance
as
soon
as
the
slaughter
of
the
buffaloes
and
sheep
is
over
the
king
retires
and
goes
to
his
supper
for
he
fasts
all
these
nine
days
and
each
day
they
eat
nothing
until
all
is
finished
and
their
hour
for
food
is
midnight
the
bayaderes
remain
dancing
before
the
idol
a
long
time
after
all
this
is
done
in
this
way
are
celebrated
these
festivals
of
nine
days
on
the
last
day
there
are
slaughtered
two
hundred
and
fifty
buffaloes
and
four
thousand
five
hundred
sheep
when
these
days
of
festival
are
past
the
king
holds
a
review
of
all
his
forces
and
the
review
is
thus
arranged
the
king
commands
to
pitch
his
tent
of
mecca
velvet
a
full
league
from
the
city
at
a
place
already
fixed
for
that
purpose
and
in
this
tent
they
place
the
idol
in
honour
of
which
all
these
festivals
are
celebrated
from
this
tent
to
the
king
palace
the
captains
range
themselves
with
their
troops
and
array
each
one
in
his
place
according
to
his
rank
in
the
king
household
thus
the
soldiers
stand
in
line
but
it
does
not
appear
to
you
to
be
only
one
line
but
in
some
places
two
or
three
one
behind
the
other
where
there
was
a
lake
it
was
surrounded
with
troops
and
where
the
road
was
narrow
they
were
drawn
up
on
the
plain
and
so
on
the
slope
of
the
hills
and
eminences
in
such
a
way
that
you
could
see
neither
plain
nor
hill
that
was
not
entirely
covered
with
troops
those
on
foot
stood
in
front
of
those
on
horses
and
the
elephants
behind
the
horses
in
this
array
was
each
captain
with
his
troops
the
captains
who
had
their
stations
inside
the
city
since
the
soldiers
could
not
be
drawn
up
on
the
flat
roofs
of
the
houses
put
up
scaffoldings
across
the
mouths
of
the
streets
to
hold
the
troops
in
such
a
way
that
all
were
full
both
outside
and
in
now
i
should
like
to
describe
to
you
how
they
were
armed
and
their
decorations
the
cavalry
were
mounted
on
horses
fully
caparisoned
and
on
their
foreheads
plates
some
of
silver
but
most
of
them
gilded
with
fringes
of
twisted
silk
of
all
colours
and
reins
of
the
same
others
had
trappings
of
mecca
velvet
which
is
velvet
of
many
colours
with
fringes
and
ornaments
others
had
them
of
other
silks
such
as
satins
and
damask
and
others
of
brocade
from
china
and
persia
some
of
the
men
with
the
gilded
plates
had
them
set
with
many
large
precious
stones
and
on
the
borders
of
small
stones
some
of
these
horses
had
on
their
foreheads
heads
of
serpents
and
of
other
large
animals
of
various
kinds
made
in
such
a
strange
manner
that
they
were
a
sight
to
see
for
the
perfection
of
their
make
the
horsemen
were
dressed
in
quilted
tunics
also
of
brocade
and
velvet
and
every
kind
of
silk
these
tunics
are
made
of
layers
of
very
strong
raw
leather
and
furnished
with
other
iron
plates
that
make
them
strong
some
have
these
plates
gilded
both
inside
and
out
and
some
are
made
of
silver
their
headpieces
are
in
the
manner
of
helmets
with
borders
covering
the
neck
and
each
has
its
piece
to
protect
the
face
they
are
of
the
same
fashion
as
the
tunics
they
wear
on
the
neck
gorgets
cofos
all
gilded
others
made
of
silk
with
plates
of
gold
and
silver
others
of
steel
as
bright
as
a
mirror
at
the
waists
they
have
swords
and
small
and
in
their
hands
javelins
with
the
shafts
covered
with
gold
and
silver
all
have
their
umbrellas
of
state
made
of
embroidered
velvet
and
damask
with
many
coloured
silks
on
the
horses
they
wave
many
standards
with
white
and
coloured
tails
and
hold
them
in
much
esteem
which
tails
are
horses
tails
the
elephants
in
the
same
way
are
covered
with
caparison
of
velvet
and
gold
with
fringes
and
rich
cloths
of
many
colours
and
with
bells
so
that
the
earth
resounds
and
on
their
heads
are
painted
faces
of
giants
and
other
kinds
of
great
beasts
on
the
back
of
each
one
of
them
are
three
or
four
men
dressed
in
their
quilted
tunics
and
armed
with
shields
and
javelins
and
they
are
arrayed
as
if
for
a
foray
then
turning
to
the
troops
on
foot
there
are
so
many
that
they
surround
all
the
valleys
and
hills
in
a
way
with
which
nothing
in
the
world
can
compare
you
will
see
amongst
them
dresses
of
such
rich
cloths
that
i
do
not
know
where
they
came
from
nor
could
any
one
tell
how
many
colours
they
have
with
their
shields
with
many
flowers
of
gold
and
silver
on
them
others
with
figures
of
tigers
and
other
great
beasts
others
all
covered
with
silver
beautifully
wrought
others
with
painted
colours
others
black
and
so
polished
that
you
can
see
into
them
as
into
a
mirror
and
their
swords
so
richly
ornamented
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
more
so
of
the
archers
i
must
tell
you
that
they
have
bows
plated
with
gold
and
silver
and
others
have
them
polished
and
their
arrows
very
neat
and
so
feathered
that
they
could
not
be
better
daggers
at
their
waists
and
with
the
shafts
and
ends
of
gold
and
silver
then
you
see
musqueteers
with
their
musquets
and
blunderbusses
and
their
thick
tunics
all
in
their
order
with
their
in
all
their
bravery
it
was
indeed
a
thing
to
see
then
the
moors
one
must
not
forget
them
for
they
were
there
also
in
the
review
with
their
shields
javelins
and
turkish
bows
with
many
bombs
and
spears
and
and
i
was
much
astonished
to
find
amongst
them
men
who
knew
so
well
how
to
work
these
weapons
the
king
leaves
his
palace
riding
on
the
horse
of
which
i
have
already
told
you
clothed
in
the
many
rich
white
cloths
i
have
mentioned
with
two
umbrellas
of
state
all
gilded
and
covered
with
crimson
velvet
and
with
the
jewels
and
adornments
which
they
keep
for
the
purpose
of
wearing
at
such
times
he
who
ever
wears
such
jewels
can
understand
the
sort
of
things
so
great
a
lord
would
wear
then
to
see
the
grandeur
of
the
nobles
and
men
of
rank
i
can
not
possibly
describe
it
all
nor
should
i
be
believed
if
i
tried
to
do
so
then
to
see
the
horses
and
the
armour
that
they
wear
you
would
see
them
so
covered
with
metal
plates
that
i
have
no
words
to
express
what
i
saw
and
some
hid
from
me
the
sight
of
others
and
to
try
and
tell
of
all
i
saw
is
hopeless
for
i
went
along
with
my
head
so
often
turned
from
one
side
to
the
other
that
i
was
almost
falling
backwards
off
my
horse
with
my
senses
lost
the
cost
of
it
all
is
not
so
much
to
be
wondered
at
as
there
is
so
much
money
in
the
land
and
the
chiefs
are
so
wealthy
there
went
in
front
of
the
king
many
elephants
with
their
coverings
and
ornaments
as
i
have
said
the
king
had
before
him
some
twenty
horses
fully
caparisoned
and
saddled
with
embroideries
of
gold
and
precious
stones
that
showed
off
well
the
grandeur
and
state
of
their
lord
close
to
the
king
went
a
cage
such
as
is
seen
at
lisbon
on
the
day
of
the
corpo
de
dios
festival
and
it
was
gilded
and
very
large
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
made
of
copper
or
silver
it
was
carried
by
sixteen
men
eight
on
each
side
besides
others
who
took
their
turns
and
in
it
is
carried
the
idol
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
thus
accompanied
the
king
passed
along
gazing
at
his
soldiers
who
gave
great
shouts
and
cries
and
struck
their
shields
the
horses
neighed
the
elephants
screamed
so
that
it
seemed
as
it
the
city
would
be
overturned
the
hills
and
valleys
and
all
the
ground
trembled
with
the
discharges
of
arms
and
musquets
and
to
see
the
bombs
and
over
the
plains
this
was
indeed
wonderful
truly
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
were
collected
there
in
this
way
it
went
on
till
the
king
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
tent
was
that
i
have
already
mentioned
and
he
entered
his
and
performed
his
usual
ceremonies
and
prayers
you
must
not
think
that
when
the
king
passed
the
troops
moved
from
their
positions
on
the
contrary
they
stood
motionless
in
their
places
till
the
king
returned
as
soon
as
the
king
had
finished
his
ceremonies
he
again
took
horse
and
returned
to
the
city
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
come
the
troops
never
wearying
of
their
shouting
as
soon
as
he
passed
by
them
they
began
to
march
then
to
see
those
who
were
on
the
hills
and
slopes
and
the
descent
of
them
with
their
shouts
and
beating
of
shields
and
shaking
of
arrows
and
bows
that
were
without
count
truly
i
was
so
carried
out
with
myself
that
it
seemed
as
if
what
i
saw
was
a
vision
and
that
i
was
in
a
dream
then
the
troops
began
to
march
to
their
tents
and
pavilions
in
the
plains
which
were
in
great
number
and
all
the
captains
accompanied
the
king
as
far
as
the
palace
and
thence
departed
to
rest
themselves
from
their
labour
now
i
desire
you
to
know
that
this
king
has
continually
a
million
fighting
troops
in
which
are
included
cavalry
in
armour
all
these
are
in
his
pay
and
he
has
these
troops
always
together
and
ready
to
be
despatched
to
any
quarter
whenever
such
may
be
necessary
i
saw
being
in
this
city
of
bisnaga
the
king
despatch
a
force
against
a
place
one
of
those
which
he
has
by
the
and
he
sent
fifty
captains
with
soldiers
amongst
whom
were
many
cavalry
he
has
many
elephants
and
when
the
king
wishes
to
show
the
strength
of
his
power
to
any
of
his
adversaries
amongst
the
three
kings
bordering
on
his
kingdom
they
say
that
he
puts
into
the
field
two
million
soldiers
in
consequence
of
which
he
is
the
most
feared
king
of
any
in
these
parts
and
although
he
takes
away
so
many
men
from
his
kingdom
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
kingdom
remains
devoid
of
men
it
is
so
full
that
it
would
seem
to
you
as
if
he
had
never
taken
away
a
man
and
this
by
reason
of
the
many
and
great
merchants
that
are
in
it
there
are
working
people
and
all
other
kinds
of
men
who
are
employed
in
business
besides
those
who
are
obliged
to
go
into
the
field
there
are
also
a
great
number
of
brahmans
in
all
the
land
of
the
heathen
there
are
these
brahmans
they
are
men
who
do
not
eat
anything
that
suffers
death
they
have
little
stomach
for
the
use
of
arms
should
any
one
ask
what
revenues
this
king
possesses
and
what
his
treasure
is
that
enables
him
to
pay
so
many
troops
since
he
has
so
many
and
such
great
lords
in
his
kingdom
who
the
greater
part
of
them
have
themselves
revenues
i
answer
thus
these
captains
whom
he
has
over
these
troops
of
his
are
the
nobles
of
his
kingdom
they
are
lords
and
they
hold
the
city
and
the
towns
and
villages
of
the
kingdom
there
are
captains
amongst
them
who
have
a
revenue
of
a
million
and
a
million
a
half
of
pardaos
others
a
hundred
thousand
pardaos
others
two
hundred
three
hundred
or
five
hundred
thousand
pardaos
and
as
each
one
has
revenue
so
the
king
fixes
for
him
the
number
of
troops
he
must
maintain
in
foot
horse
and
elephants
these
troops
are
always
ready
for
duty
whenever
they
may
be
called
out
and
wherever
they
may
have
to
go
and
in
this
way
he
has
this
million
of
fighting
men
always
ready
each
of
these
captains
labours
to
turn
out
the
best
troops
he
can
get
because
he
pays
them
their
salaries
and
in
this
review
there
were
the
finest
young
men
possible
to
be
seen
or
that
ever
could
be
seen
for
in
all
this
array
i
did
not
see
a
man
that
would
act
the
coward
besides
maintaining
these
troops
each
captain
has
to
make
his
annual
payments
to
the
king
and
the
king
has
his
own
salaried
troops
to
whom
he
gives
pay
he
has
eight
hundred
elephants
attached
to
his
person
and
five
hundred
horses
always
in
his
stables
and
for
the
expenses
of
these
horses
and
elephants
he
has
devoted
the
revenues
that
he
receives
from
this
city
of
bisnaga
you
may
well
imagine
how
great
these
expenses
may
be
and
besides
these
that
of
the
servants
who
have
the
care
of
the
horses
and
elephants
and
by
this
you
will
be
able
to
judge
what
will
be
the
revenue
of
this
city
this
king
of
bisnaga
has
five
kings
his
subjects
and
vassals
besides
other
captains
and
lords
having
large
territories
and
great
revenues
whenever
a
son
happens
to
be
born
to
this
king
or
a
daughter
all
the
nobles
of
the
kingdom
offer
him
great
presents
of
money
and
jewels
of
price
and
so
they
do
to
him
every
year
on
the
day
of
his
birth
you
must
know
that
when
these
feasts
of
which
i
have
spoken
are
ended
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
october
when
eleven
of
its
days
are
past
they
make
great
feasts
during
which
every
one
puts
on
new
and
rich
and
handsome
cloths
each
one
according
to
his
liking
and
all
the
captains
give
their
men
handsome
cloths
of
many
colours
each
one
having
his
own
colour
and
device
on
the
same
day
they
give
great
gifts
of
money
to
the
king
it
is
even
said
that
they
give
on
that
day
to
the
king
in
money
a
million
and
five
hundred
thousand
gold
pardaos
and
each
pardao
is
worth
three
hundred
and
sixty
reis
and
from
this
you
will
be
able
to
know
how
many
reis
there
will
be
i
wish
you
to
know
that
on
this
day
begins
their
year
it
is
their
new
year
day
and
for
this
they
make
the
feast
and
give
the
gifts
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
we
also
do
the
same
on
new
year
day
they
begin
the
year
in
this
month
with
the
new
moon
and
they
count
the
months
always
from
moon
to
moon
and
now
i
wish
you
to
know
that
the
previous
kings
of
this
place
for
many
years
past
have
held
it
a
custom
to
maintain
a
treasury
which
treasury
after
the
death
of
each
is
kept
locked
and
sealed
in
such
a
way
that
it
can
not
be
seen
by
any
one
nor
opened
nor
do
the
kings
who
succeed
to
the
kingdom
open
them
or
know
what
is
in
them
they
are
not
opened
except
when
the
kings
have
great
need
and
thus
the
kingdom
has
great
supplies
to
meet
its
needs
this
king
has
made
his
treasury
different
from
those
of
the
previous
kings
and
he
puts
in
it
every
year
ten
million
pardaos
without
taking
from
them
one
pardao
more
than
for
the
expenses
of
his
house
the
rest
remains
for
him
over
and
above
these
expenses
and
of
the
expenses
in
the
houses
of
his
wives
of
whom
i
have
already
told
you
that
he
keeps
near
him
twelve
thousand
women
from
this
you
will
be
able
to
judge
how
great
is
the
richness
of
this
kingdom
and
how
great
the
treasure
that
this
king
has
amassed
and
if
any
one
does
not
know
what
a
pardao
is
let
him
know
that
it
is
a
round
gold
coin
which
coin
is
not
struck
anywhere
in
india
except
in
this
kingdom
it
bears
impressed
on
it
on
one
side
two
images
and
on
the
other
the
name
of
the
king
who
commanded
it
to
be
struck
those
which
this
king
ordered
to
be
struck
have
only
one
image
this
coin
is
current
all
over
india
each
pardao
as
already
said
is
worth
three
hundred
and
sixty
reis
after
all
these
things
feasts
had
passed
the
king
betook
himself
to
the
new
city
of
which
i
have
already
told
you
that
he
delights
in
it
much
because
it
was
made
and
peopled
by
him
of
which
i
have
already
told
you
in
two
years
the
king
built
this
city
the
king
was
received
by
the
citizens
with
great
feasts
and
the
streets
were
hung
with
rich
cloths
and
with
many
triumphal
arches
under
which
he
passed
in
this
city
the
king
held
another
review
of
the
troops
of
his
guard
and
he
distributed
pay
to
all
because
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
it
is
their
custom
to
pay
salaries
year
by
year
an
inspection
is
held
by
the
officers
of
his
house
and
they
write
down
the
name
of
each
one
and
the
marks
that
he
has
on
his
face
or
body
there
are
men
of
the
guard
who
have
a
thousand
pardaos
pay
and
others
eight
hundred
others
six
hundred
and
more
and
a
little
more
or
less
there
is
a
difference
and
also
a
difference
in
the
persons
some
men
of
them
who
are
of
higher
rank
than
others
have
two
horses
or
three
and
others
have
no
more
than
one
these
troops
have
their
captains
and
each
captain
goes
with
his
guard
to
mount
guard
at
the
palace
according
to
order
and
custom
the
king
has
in
his
guard
five
hundred
horse
and
these
watch
outside
the
palace
armed
with
their
weapons
there
are
two
watches
inside
and
people
with
swords
and
shields
the
king
then
being
in
his
new
city
as
i
have
said
christovao
de
figueiredo
begged
him
of
his
kindness
that
he
would
permit
him
to
be
shown
the
palace
of
the
city
of
bisnaga
forasmuch
as
there
had
come
with
him
many
portuguese
who
had
never
been
in
bisnaga
and
they
would
rejoice
to
see
it
in
order
to
have
somewhat
to
tell
of
on
their
return
to
their
own
lands
whenever
god
should
take
them
there
the
king
at
once
commanded
that
they
should
be
shown
certain
of
his
residences
for
that
of
his
wives
no
one
ever
sees
as
soon
as
we
had
returned
to
the
city
of
bisnaga
the
governor
of
that
place
who
is
called
gamdarajo
and
is
brother
of
salvatinica
showed
us
the
palace
you
must
know
that
on
entering
that
gate
of
which
i
have
spoken
by
which
the
ladies
serving
the
king
wives
make
their
exit
when
they
come
to
the
feast
opposite
to
it
there
is
another
of
the
same
kind
here
they
bade
us
stand
still
and
they
counted
us
how
many
we
were
and
as
they
counted
they
admitted
us
one
by
one
to
a
small
courtyard
with
a
smoothly
plastered
floor
and
with
very
white
walls
around
it
at
the
end
of
this
courtyard
opposite
this
gate
by
which
we
entered
is
another
close
to
it
on
the
left
hand
and
another
which
was
closed
the
door
opposite
belongs
to
the
king
residence
at
the
entrance
of
this
door
outside
are
two
images
painted
like
life
and
drawn
in
their
manner
which
are
these
the
one
on
the
right
hand
is
of
the
father
of
this
king
and
the
one
on
the
left
is
of
this
king
the
father
was
dark
and
a
gentleman
of
fine
form
stouter
than
the
son
is
they
stand
with
all
their
apparel
and
such
raiment
as
they
wear
or
used
to
wear
when
alive
afterwards
wishing
to
pass
in
at
this
door
they
again
counted
us
and
after
they
had
finished
counting
us
we
entered
a
little
house
which
contained
what
i
shall
now
relate
as
soon
as
you
are
inside
on
the
left
hand
are
two
chambers
one
above
the
other
which
are
in
this
manner
the
lower
one
is
below
the
level
of
the
ground
with
two
little
steps
which
are
covered
with
copper
gilded
and
from
there
to
the
top
is
all
lined
with
gold
i
do
not
say
gilded
but
lined
inside
and
outside
it
is
it
has
a
porch
made
of
over
which
is
a
work
of
rubies
and
diamonds
and
all
other
kinds
of
precious
stones
and
pearls
and
above
the
porch
are
two
pendants
of
gold
all
the
precious
stonework
is
in
and
interweaved
between
one
and
another
is
a
twist
of
thick
work
on
the
dome
are
pendants
of
the
same
in
this
chamber
was
a
bed
which
had
feet
similar
to
the
porch
the
covered
with
gold
and
there
was
on
it
a
mattress
of
black
satin
it
had
all
round
it
a
railing
of
pearls
a
span
wide
on
it
were
two
cushions
and
no
other
covering
of
the
chamber
above
it
i
shall
not
say
if
it
held
anything
because
i
did
not
see
it
but
only
the
one
below
on
the
right
side
in
this
house
there
is
a
room
with
pillars
of
carved
stone
this
room
is
all
of
ivory
as
well
the
chamber
as
the
walls
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
pillars
of
the
at
the
top
had
roses
and
flowers
of
lotuses
all
of
ivory
and
all
well
executed
so
that
there
could
not
be
better
it
is
so
rich
and
beautiful
that
you
would
hardly
find
anywhere
another
such
on
this
same
side
is
designed
in
painting
all
the
ways
of
life
of
the
men
who
have
been
here
even
down
to
the
portuguese
from
which
the
king
wives
can
understand
the
manner
in
which
each
one
lives
in
his
own
country
even
to
the
blind
and
the
beggars
in
this
house
are
two
thrones
covered
with
gold
and
a
cot
of
silver
with
its
curtains
here
i
saw
a
little
slab
of
green
jasper
which
is
held
for
a
great
thing
in
this
house
close
to
where
this
jasper
is
underneath
some
arches
where
is
the
entrance
into
the
palace
there
is
a
little
door
closed
with
some
padlocks
they
told
us
that
inside
it
there
was
a
treasury
of
one
of
the
former
kings
as
soon
as
we
left
this
house
we
entered
a
courtyard
as
large
as
an
arena
for
very
well
plastered
and
almost
in
the
middle
are
some
pillars
of
wood
with
a
cross
beam
at
the
top
all
covered
with
copper
gilt
and
in
the
middle
four
chains
of
silver
links
with
hooks
which
are
caught
one
into
the
other
this
serves
for
a
swing
for
the
wives
of
the
king
at
the
entrance
of
this
courtyard
on
the
right
hand
we
mounted
four
or
five
steps
and
entered
some
beautiful
houses
made
in
the
way
i
have
already
told
you
for
their
houses
are
houses
with
flat
roofs
on
top
although
on
top
there
may
be
other
houses
the
plan
is
good
and
they
are
like
terraces
there
is
a
building
there
built
on
many
pillars
which
are
of
and
so
also
is
all
the
work
of
the
roof
with
all
the
rest
of
wood
maneria
and
all
the
pillars
with
all
the
other
work
are
gilded
so
that
they
seem
as
if
covered
with
gold
then
at
the
entrance
of
this
building
in
the
middle
nave
there
is
standing
on
four
pillars
a
canopy
covered
with
many
figures
of
besides
other
small
figures
which
are
placed
in
the
all
this
is
also
gilded
and
has
some
red
colour
on
the
of
the
leaves
which
stand
out
from
the
sculpture
you
must
know
that
they
make
no
use
of
this
building
because
it
belongs
to
their
idol
and
to
the
temple
at
the
end
of
this
is
a
little
closed
door
where
the
idol
is
whenever
they
celebrate
any
festival
of
this
idol
they
carry
it
on
a
golden
throne
and
put
it
underneath
that
canopy
which
is
made
for
that
purpose
and
then
come
the
brahmans
to
perform
their
ceremonies
there
and
the
come
to
dance
descending
from
this
building
we
passed
on
the
left
side
of
the
courtyard
and
we
entered
a
corridor
which
runs
the
whole
length
of
it
in
which
we
saw
some
things
on
entering
the
corridor
was
a
cot
suspended
in
the
air
by
silver
chains
the
cot
had
feet
made
of
bars
of
gold
so
well
made
that
they
could
not
be
better
and
the
of
the
cot
were
covered
with
gold
in
front
of
this
cot
was
a
chamber
where
was
another
cot
suspended
in
the
air
by
chains
of
gold
this
cot
had
feet
of
gold
with
much
setting
of
precious
stones
and
the
were
covered
with
gold
above
this
chamber
was
another
smaller
and
with
nothing
in
it
save
only
that
it
was
gilt
and
painted
passing
this
chamber
along
the
same
corridor
in
front
was
a
chamber
which
this
king
commanded
to
be
made
on
the
outside
were
figures
of
women
with
bows
and
arrows
like
amazons
they
had
begun
to
paint
this
chamber
and
they
told
us
that
it
had
to
be
finer
than
the
others
and
that
it
was
to
be
all
plated
with
gold
as
well
the
ground
below
as
all
the
rest
passing
this
corridor
and
mounting
up
into
another
which
is
higher
we
saw
at
one
end
three
caldrons
of
gold
so
large
that
in
each
one
they
could
cook
half
a
cow
and
with
them
were
others
very
large
ones
of
silver
and
also
little
pots
of
gold
and
some
large
ones
thence
we
went
up
by
a
little
staircase
and
entered
by
a
little
door
into
a
building
which
is
in
this
manner
this
hall
is
where
the
king
sends
his
women
to
be
taught
to
dance
it
is
a
long
hall
and
not
very
wide
all
of
stone
sculpture
on
pillars
which
are
at
a
distance
of
quite
an
arm
length
from
the
wall
between
one
and
another
is
an
arm
length
and
a
half
perhaps
a
little
more
these
pillars
stand
in
that
manner
all
around
the
building
they
are
made
with
other
hollows
all
gilt
in
the
supports
or
pedestals
on
the
top
are
many
great
beasts
like
elephants
and
of
other
shapes
it
is
open
so
that
the
interior
is
seen
and
there
are
on
the
inner
side
of
these
beasts
other
images
each
placed
according
to
its
character
there
are
also
figures
of
men
turned
back
to
back
and
other
beasts
of
different
sorts
in
each
case
from
pillar
to
pillar
is
a
the
architrave
which
is
like
a
panel
and
from
pillar
to
pillar
are
many
such
panels
there
are
images
of
old
men
too
gilded
and
of
the
size
of
a
cubit
each
of
the
panels
has
one
placed
in
this
way
these
images
are
over
all
the
building
and
on
the
pillars
are
other
images
smaller
with
other
images
yet
more
subordinate
and
other
figures
again
in
such
a
way
that
i
saw
this
work
gradually
diminishing
in
size
on
these
pillars
with
their
designs
from
pillar
to
pillar
and
each
time
smaller
by
the
size
of
a
span
as
it
went
on
becoming
lost
so
it
went
dwindling
gradually
away
till
there
remained
of
all
the
sculptured
work
only
the
dome
the
most
beautiful
i
ever
saw
between
these
images
and
pillars
runs
a
design
of
foliage
like
plates
a
maneyra
de
lamines
all
gilt
with
the
reverses
of
the
leaves
in
red
and
blue
the
images
that
are
on
the
pillars
are
stags
and
other
animals
they
are
painted
in
colours
with
the
pink
on
their
faces
but
the
other
images
seated
on
the
elephants
as
well
as
those
on
the
panels
are
all
dancing
women
having
tattle
drums
the
designs
of
these
panels
show
the
positions
at
the
ends
of
dances
in
such
a
way
that
on
each
panel
there
is
a
dancer
in
the
proper
position
at
the
end
of
the
dance
this
is
to
teach
the
women
so
that
if
they
forget
the
position
in
which
they
have
to
remain
when
the
dance
is
done
they
may
look
at
one
of
the
panels
where
is
the
end
of
that
dance
by
that
they
keep
in
mind
what
they
have
to
do
at
the
end
of
this
house
on
the
left
hand
is
a
painted
recess
where
the
women
cling
on
with
their
hands
in
order
better
to
stretch
and
loosen
their
bodies
and
legs
there
they
teach
them
to
make
the
whole
body
supple
in
order
to
make
their
dancing
more
graceful
at
the
other
end
on
the
right
in
the
place
where
the
king
places
himself
to
watch
them
dancing
all
the
floors
and
walls
where
he
sits
are
covered
with
gold
and
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
is
a
golden
image
of
a
woman
of
the
size
of
a
girl
of
twelve
years
with
her
arms
in
the
position
which
she
occupies
in
the
end
of
a
dance
they
did
not
show
us
more
than
this
the
residence
of
the
women
no
one
may
see
except
the
eunuchs
of
whom
i
have
already
told
you
from
here
we
returned
by
the
way
we
had
entered
to
the
second
gate
and
there
they
again
counted
us
of
the
city
of
bisnaga
they
say
that
there
are
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
in
it
all
and
to
each
of
which
there
is
a
low
surrounding
wall
and
in
this
city
the
king
lives
most
of
the
time
on
the
north
side
are
rocky
hills
a
river
runs
between
them
and
the
wall
runs
along
the
top
of
them
and
on
the
farther
side
is
a
city
called
nagumdym
and
it
has
only
three
gates
namely
one
by
the
river
which
they
cross
in
boats
embarking
just
at
this
gate
one
on
the
other
side
which
is
to
the
north
this
is
a
stronger
gate
and
one
on
the
side
a
little
gate
between
two
very
high
ridges
and
it
is
such
a
bad
road
that
only
one
horseman
can
pass
out
a
time
and
on
the
side
of
bisnaga
is
another
city
called
crisnapor
connected
with
bisnaga
in
which
are
all
their
pagodas
those
in
which
they
most
worship
and
all
the
revenue
of
this
city
is
granted
to
them
and
they
say
that
they
have
a
revenue
of
a
hundred
thousand
pardaos
of
gold
the
pagodas
are
high
and
have
great
buildings
with
many
figures
of
men
and
women
all
in
lascivious
attitudes
on
the
south
side
is
the
other
city
called
nagalapor
in
a
plain
in
it
the
ydalcao
stopped
with
all
his
forces
when
he
besieged
bisnaga
and
he
razed
it
to
the
ground
but
already
it
is
again
rebuilt
and
this
is
a
league
from
bisnaga
on
the
east
side
is
another
city
called
ardegema
which
is
the
name
of
the
principal
wife
of
this
king
and
it
is
new
and
he
built
it
for
love
of
her
chronicle
of
fernao
nuniz
written
probably
chapter
copy
and
summary
of
a
chronicle
of
the
kings
of
bisnaga
who
reigned
orig
were
from
the
era
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirty
which
was
after
the
general
destruction
of
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
in
the
year
twelve
hundred
and
thirty
these
parts
of
india
were
ruled
by
a
greater
monarch
than
had
ever
reigned
this
was
the
king
of
dili
who
by
force
of
arms
and
soldiers
made
war
on
cambaya
for
many
years
taking
and
destroying
in
that
period
the
land
of
guzarate
which
belongs
to
cambaya
and
in
the
end
he
became
its
lord
and
this
taken
not
being
content
with
the
victory
which
he
had
already
gained
he
made
ready
a
large
army
of
foot
and
horse
and
determined
to
make
war
on
the
king
of
bisnaga
leaving
his
captains
in
his
lands
and
fortresses
to
defend
themselves
against
his
enemies
of
whom
there
were
many
for
this
king
was
at
that
time
at
war
with
bemgalla
and
with
the
turkomans
on
the
confines
of
the
country
of
sheikh
ismael
these
men
are
fair
and
large
of
body
in
their
lands
are
many
horses
with
which
this
king
of
delly
made
war
on
cambaya
and
laid
it
waste
and
after
the
country
was
taken
and
he
lord
of
it
there
still
remained
to
him
as
many
as
eight
hundred
thousand
horsemen
with
whom
he
passed
on
to
bisnaga
of
the
number
of
people
on
foot
nothing
is
said
here
because
no
one
counted
them
and
determining
to
make
war
on
the
king
of
bisnaga
and
to
reduce
him
under
his
rule
he
passed
out
of
the
lands
which
he
had
newly
gained
entering
into
those
of
the
king
of
bisnaga
which
at
that
time
were
many
and
quitting
the
kingdom
of
cambaya
he
began
to
invade
and
make
war
on
the
ballagate
whose
lands
now
belong
to
the
idalcao
taking
and
destroying
many
towns
and
places
in
such
a
way
that
the
people
of
the
country
surrendered
to
him
their
persons
and
property
though
he
left
to
them
their
weapons
which
he
could
not
prevent
their
carrying
and
after
he
had
become
lord
of
all
the
country
of
the
ballagate
he
passed
the
river
of
duree
which
forms
the
boundary
of
the
territories
of
the
ballagate
and
of
those
of
the
king
of
bisnaga
which
river
he
passed
in
without
finding
any
one
to
oppose
the
passage
up
to
that
time
in
all
that
was
afterwards
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
no
place
was
populated
save
only
the
city
of
nagumdym
in
which
the
king
of
bisnaga
then
was
awaiting
his
destruction
since
it
was
strong
and
because
he
possessed
no
other
citadel
but
that
which
was
his
lisbon
and
from
the
river
which
that
king
of
delly
passed
in
to
that
city
was
leagues
all
being
open
country
campos
and
in
them
it
seemed
good
to
him
to
pitch
his
camp
so
that
his
people
might
drink
of
the
water
in
the
plain
campos
along
the
length
of
the
river
at
that
time
there
was
great
drought
by
reason
of
the
summer
season
and
the
waters
of
the
few
little
lakes
that
were
in
the
plain
would
not
suffice
for
ten
days
for
his
troops
horses
and
elephants
without
drying
up
and
for
that
reason
he
halted
some
days
by
the
banks
of
that
river
till
rain
fell
in
the
fields
and
lakes
enough
for
such
a
large
army
as
he
had
brought
with
him
and
when
the
time
came
he
raised
his
camp
and
brought
his
array
to
a
halt
in
sight
of
that
city
of
nagundy
and
the
king
of
bisnaga
seeing
his
great
power
and
how
many
troops
he
had
brought
with
him
determined
to
abandon
the
city
which
was
very
difficult
to
enter
close
to
which
was
and
now
is
a
river
which
is
called
nagundy
whence
the
city
is
called
nagundy
and
they
say
the
city
had
its
name
because
of
it
and
he
fled
for
shelter
to
a
fortress
called
crynamata
which
was
by
the
bank
of
the
river
and
which
contained
much
provision
and
water
but
not
enough
for
the
sustenance
of
so
many
people
as
he
had
with
him
as
many
as
fifty
thousand
men
therefore
the
king
chose
five
thousand
men
with
their
property
and
took
refuge
in
the
fortress
and
for
the
rest
he
bade
them
betake
themselves
to
another
fortress
of
his
in
another
part
of
his
kingdom
and
being
sheltered
in
the
fortress
after
he
had
taken
order
about
his
provisions
he
was
beset
on
all
sides
by
the
king
of
the
people
of
dely
who
had
already
up
to
this
time
been
at
war
with
him
for
twelve
years
over
which
siege
little
time
was
spent
because
the
people
that
were
inside
the
fortress
were
numerous
and
in
a
little
space
had
consumed
their
provisions
then
the
king
of
bisnaga
seeing
the
determination
of
the
soldiers
of
the
king
of
delly
that
they
would
never
leave
the
place
without
making
an
end
of
those
whom
he
had
with
him
in
the
fortress
made
a
speech
to
them
all
laying
before
them
the
destruction
that
the
king
of
the
troops
of
dely
had
caused
in
his
own
kingdoms
and
how
not
content
with
that
he
had
besieged
this
fortress
so
that
now
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
look
to
but
death
since
already
there
was
no
water
in
the
fortress
nor
anything
left
to
eat
and
he
said
that
of
the
fifty
thousand
men
who
had
been
in
the
city
of
nagundy
he
had
chosen
them
alone
as
his
companions
and
true
friends
and
he
begged
of
them
that
they
would
hold
fast
in
death
to
the
loyalty
which
they
had
borne
him
in
their
lives
for
he
hoped
that
day
to
give
battle
to
the
king
of
delly
then
he
said
that
already
there
remained
to
him
of
his
kingdom
and
lordship
nothing
but
that
fortress
and
the
people
that
were
in
it
and
so
he
asked
them
to
arm
themselves
and
die
with
him
in
battle
giving
their
lives
to
the
enemy
who
had
deprived
them
of
all
their
lands
all
of
them
were
very
content
and
glad
at
this
and
in
a
short
space
were
all
armed
and
after
they
were
so
the
king
made
them
another
speech
saying
before
we
join
battle
we
have
to
wage
another
war
with
our
sons
and
daughters
and
wives
for
it
will
not
be
good
that
we
should
allow
them
to
be
taken
for
the
use
of
our
enemies
and
the
king
said
i
will
be
the
first
to
deal
with
my
wife
and
sons
at
this
time
they
were
all
standing
in
a
large
open
space
which
was
before
the
citadel
and
there
by
the
hand
of
the
king
were
slain
over
fifty
of
his
wives
and
some
sons
and
little
daughters
and
the
same
was
done
with
their
own
hands
by
all
who
had
wives
and
sons
that
could
not
fight
when
these
nuptial
feasts
so
abhorred
of
all
were
fulfilled
they
opened
the
gates
of
the
fortress
and
their
enemies
forthwith
entered
and
slew
all
of
them
except
six
old
men
who
withdrew
to
a
house
these
were
made
captive
and
were
taken
before
the
king
of
delhi
and
the
king
asked
them
who
they
were
and
how
they
had
escaped
and
they
told
them
who
they
were
at
which
the
king
greatly
rejoiced
because
one
of
them
was
the
minister
of
the
kingdom
and
another
the
treasurer
and
the
others
were
leading
officers
in
it
they
were
questioned
by
the
king
concerning
the
treasures
of
the
king
of
bisnaga
and
such
riches
as
were
buried
in
the
vaults
of
the
fortress
were
delivered
up
to
him
they
also
gave
him
an
account
of
the
revenues
of
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
at
that
time
when
all
was
known
to
the
king
he
delivered
them
to
one
of
his
captains
and
commanded
to
make
over
the
bodies
of
the
dead
to
another
captain
and
gave
orders
that
the
bodies
should
be
burned
and
the
body
of
the
king
at
the
request
of
those
six
men
was
conveyed
very
honourably
to
the
city
of
nagundy
from
that
time
forward
that
place
became
a
of
the
kings
amongst
themselves
they
still
worship
this
king
as
a
saint

did

he
had

entirely
overthrown

and
seized
his
lands
for
himself
none
being
left
to
defend
them
as
soon
as
the
king
had
thus
fulfilled
all
his
desires
he
bade
his
captains
destroy
some
villages
and

which
had
risen
against
him
and
give
security
to
those
who
sought
it
of
him
after

he
stayed
in

fortress
two
years
having
already
for
twelve
waged

on
the

he
was
far
from
his
home
which
was
more
than
five
hundred
leagues
distant
and
his
forces
being
all
scattered
news
came
to
him
how
that
all
the
land
which
was
first
gained
by
him
had
rebelled
as
soon
as
this
was
known
to
the
king
he
sent
to
collect
his
people
leaving
in
this
fortress
which
was
the
strongest
in
the
kingdom
abundant
provisions
for
its
defence
in
all
circumstances
and
he
left
for
captain
and
governor
of
the
kingdom

a

and
with
him
he
left
many
troops
showing
much
kindness
to
each
one
of
them

giving
to
each
lavish
gifts
and
lands
in
such

were

how
the
king
of
dily
departed
with
his
troops
and
took
to
his
kingdom
the
six
captives
that
he
had
taken
in
the
fortress
the
king
having
departed
to
his
own
kingdom
in
consequence
of
the
news
that
had
been
brought
to
him
leaving
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
in
the
power
of
meliquy
niby
when
it
was
known
throughout
the
country
how
he
was
out
of
it
those
who
had
escaped
to
the
mountains
with
others
who
against
their
will
and
through
fear
had
taken
oaths
of
fealty
for
their
towns
and
villages
rose
against
the
captain
mileque
neby
and
came
to
besiege
him
in
the
fortress
allowing
no
provisions
to
go
in
to
him
nor
paying
him
the
taxes
that
had
been
forced
on
them
and
meliquy
niby
seeing
how
little
profit
he
could
get
in
this
country
and
how
badly
he
was
obeyed
and
how
far
off
was
the
succour
sent
by
his
lord
the
king
sent
quickly
to
him
to
tell
him
how
all
the
land
was
risen
against
him
and
how
every
one
was
lord
of
what
he
pleased
and
no
one
was
on
his
side
and
that
his
highness
should
decide
what
he
thought
best
to
be
done
in
such
case
and
when
the
king
heard
this
news
he
took
counsel
telling
the
great
people
of
the
realm
of
the
letter
and
message
which
he
had
from
melinebiquy
his
captain
and
governor
of
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
and
how
badly
the
lords
of
the
land
obeyed
him
so
that
each
one
was
king
and
lord
over
whomsoever
he
pleased
as
soon
as
he
acquired
any
power
there
being
no
justice
amongst
them
nor
any
one
whom
they
wished
to
obey
what
was
it
seemed
best
to
them
he
asked
and
what
in
such
case
ought
they
and
could
they
do
so
that
he
should
not
lose
so
fair
a
territory
and
one
so
rich
the
seizure
of
which
had
cost
such
labour
so
much
money
and
the
lives
of
so
many
of
their
fellows
all
the
councillors
decided
that
the
king
should
command
the
presence
of
the
six
men
whom
he
held
captive
and
that
he
should
learn
from
them
who
was
at
that
time
the
nearest
of
kin
or
in
any
way
related
to
the
kings
of
bisnaga
and
this
questioning
done
no
one
was
found
to
whom
by
right
the
kingdom
could
come
save
to
one
of
the
six
whom
he
held
captive
and
this
one
he
who
at
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
bisnaga
had
been
minister
of
the
kingdom
he
was
not
related
by
blood
to
the
kings
but
only
was
the
principal
judge
but
it
seemed
good
that
his
highness
should
give
the
kingdom
to
that
one
and
this
advice
pleased
the
king
and
them
all
at
once
the
six
captives
were
released
and
set
at
liberty
and
many
kindnesses
and
honours
were
done
them
and
the
governor
was
raised
to
be
king
and
the
treasurer
to
be
governor
and
he
took
from
them
oaths
and
pledges
of
their
fealty
as
vassals
and
they
were
at
once
despatched
and
sent
to
their
lands
with
a
large
following
to
defend
them
from
any
one
who
should
desire
to
do
them
an
injury
and
when
these
six
men
had
thus
finished
their
journey
to
the
city
of
nagundy
they
found
only
the
ruined
basements
of
the
houses
and
places
peopled
by
a
few
poor
folk
in
a
short
time
the
arrival
of
deorao
for
so
he
was
called
was
known
in
all
the
country
and
now
he
had
been
exalted
to
be
king
with
which
the
people
were
well
content
as
men
who
had
felt
so
deeply
their
subjection
to
a
lord
not
of
their
own
faith
and
from
this
man
have
descended
all
those
who
have
reigned
up
to
now
and
they
made
great
feasts
for
him
and
delivered
up
to
him
the
lands
taken
by
former
kings
and
lost
to
them
and
he
was
obeyed
as
king
and
when
the
captain
meliquy
niby
became
aware
of
this
he
was
very
pleased
and
contented
and
delivered
up
to
him
the
fortress
and
kingdom
as
the
king
his
lord
had
commanded
and
making
himself
ready
with
all
speed
he
departed
leaving
the
land
to
its
proper
owner
and
after
he
had
gone
king
deorao
entering
on
his
rule
strove
to
pacify
the
people
and
those
who
had
revolted
and
to
make
them
safe
and
he
did
them
many
kindnesses
so
as
to
secure
their
and
travelled
about
their
fortresses
and
towns
he
abandoned
the
lost
lands
since
he
knew
that
he
could
not
regain
them
having
no
army
or
forces
for
such
a
work
nor
any
cause
for
which
he
could
make
war
and
also
because
he
was
very
old
chapter
how
the
city
of
bisnaga
was
built
by
that
king
dehorao
the
king
going
one
day
as
was
often
his
wont
to
a
mountain
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
nagumdym
where
now
is
the
city
of
bisnaga
which
at
that
time
was
a
desert
place
in
which
much
hunting
took
place
and
which
the
king
had
reserved
for
his
own
amusement
being
in
it
with
his
dogs
and
appurtenances
of
the
chase
a
hare
rose
up
before
him
which
instead
of
fleeing
from
the
dogs
ran
towards
them
and
bit
them
all
so
that
none
of
them
dared
go
near
it
for
the
harm
that
it
did
them
and
seeing
this
the
king
astonished
at
so
feeble
a
thing
biting
dogs
which
had
already
caught
for
him
a
tiger
and
a
lion
judged
it
to
be
not
really
a
hare
but
more
likely
some
prodigy
and
he
at
once
turned
back
to
the
city
of
nagumdym
and
arriving
at
the
river
he
met
a
hermit
who
was
walking
along
the
bank
a
man
holy
among
them
to
whom
he
told
what
had
happened
concerning
the
hare
and
the
hermit
wondering
at
it
said
to
the
king
that
he
should
turn
back
with
him
and
shew
him
the
place
where
so
marvellous
a
thing
had
happened
and
being
there
the
hermit
said
that
the
king
ought
in
that
place
to
erect
houses
in
which
he
could
dwell
and
build
a
city
for
the
prodigy
meant
that
this
would
be
the
strongest
city
in
the
world
and
that
it
would
never
be
captured
by
his
enemies
and
would
be
the
chief
city
in
the
kingdom
and
so
the
king
did
and
on
that
very
day
began
work
on
his
houses
and
he
enclosed
the
city
round
about
and
that
done
he
left
nagumdym
and
soon
filled
the
new
city
with
people
and
he
gave
it
the
name
vydiajuna
for
so
the
hermit
called
himself
who
had
bidden
him
construct
it
but
in
course
of
time
this
name
has
become
corrupted
and
it
is
now
called
bisnaga
and
after
that
hermit
was
dead
the
king
raised
a
very
grand
temple
in
honour
of
him
and
gave
much
revenue
to
it
and
ever
since
in
his
memory
the
kings
of
bisnaga
on
the
day
when
they
are
raised
to
be
kings
have
in
honour
of
the
hermit
to
enter
this
house
before
they
enter
their
own
and
they
offer
many
prayers
in
it
and
celebrate
many
feasts
there
every
year
this
king
dehorao
reigned
seven
years
and
did
nothing
therein
but
pacify
the
kingdom
which
he
left
in
complete
tranquillity
by
his
death
one
called
bucarao
inherited
the
kingdom
and
he
conquered
many
lands
which
at
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
that
kingdom
remained
rebellious
and
by
him
they
were
taken
and
turned
to
his
power
and
lordship
and
he
took
the
kingdom
of
orya
which
is
very
great
it
touches
on
bemgalla
he
reigned
years
being
not
less
feared
than
esteemed
and
obeyed
by
all
in
his
kingdom
on
the
death
of
that
king
bucarao
there
came
to
the
throne
his
son
called
pureoyre
deorao
which
in
canara
means
powerful
lord
and
he
coined
a
money
of
pardaos
which
even
now
they
call
puroure
deorao
and
from
that
time
forward
it
has
become
a
custom
to
call
coins
by
the
names
of
the
kings
that
made
them
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
there
are
so
many
names
of
pardaos
in
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
and
this
king
in
his
time
did
nothing
more
than
leave
at
his
death
as
much
conquered
country
as
his
father
had
done
this
king
had
a
son
who
by
his
death
inherited
the
kingdom
who
was
called
ajarao
and
he
reigned
years
in
which
time
he
was
always
at
war
with
the
moors
and
he
took
goa
and
chaul
and
dabull
and
ceillao
and
all
the
country
of
charamamdell
which
had
also
rebelled
after
the
first
destruction
of
this
kingdom
and
he
did
many
other
things
which
are
not
recorded
here
this
king
made
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
many
walls
and
towers
and
enclosed
it
anew
now
the
city
at
that
time
was
of
no
use
there
being
no
water
in
it
by
which
could
be
raised
gardens
and
orchards
except
the
water
of
the
nagumdym
which
was
far
from
it
for
what
water
there
was
in
the
country
was
all
brackish
and
allowed
nothing
to
grow
and
the
king
desiring
to
increase
that
city
and
make
it
the
best
in
the
kingdom
determined
to
bring
to
it
a
very
large
river
which
was
at
a
distance
of
five
leagues
away
believing
that
it
would
cause
much
profit
if
brought
inside
the
city
and
so
he
did
damming
the
river
itself
with
great
boulders
and
according
to
story
he
threw
in
a
stone
so
great
that
it
alone
made
the
river
follow
the
king
will
it
was
dragged
thither
by
a
number
of
elephants
of
which
there
are
many
in
the
kingdom
and
the
water
so
brought
he
carried
through
such
parts
of
the
city
as
he
pleased
this
water
proved
of
such
use
to
the
city
that
it
increased
his
revenue
by
more
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pardaos
by
means
of
this
water
they
made
round
about
the
city
a
quantity
of
gardens
and
orchards
and
great
groves
of
trees
and
vineyards
of
which
this
country
has
many
and
many
plantations
of
lemons
and
oranges
and
roses
and
other
trees
which
in
this
country
bear
very
good
fruit
but
on
this
turning
of
the
river
they
say
the
king
spent
all
the
treasure
that
had
come
to
him
from
the
king
his
father
which
was
a
very
great
sum
of
money
this
king
left
a
son
at
his
death
called
visarao
who
inherited
the
kingdom
on
the
death
of
his
father
and
he
lived
six
years
and
during
this
time
did
nothing
worth
relating
at
his
death
he
left
a
son
called
deorao
who
reigned
years
he
determined
to
collect
great
treasures
but
owing
to
constant
warfare
he
could
not
gain
more
than
eight
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
gold
not
counting
precious
stones
this
was
no
great
sum
seeing
that
in
his
time
the
king
of
coullao
and
ceyllao
and
paleacate
and
peguu
and
tanacary
and
many
other
countries
paid
tribute
to
him
at
his
death
this
king
left
a
son
who
inherited
the
kingdom
who
was
called
pinarao
he
reigned
twelve
years
and
was
a
great
astrologer
he
was
given
much
to
letters
and
made
many
books
and
promulgated
ordinances
in
his
land
and
kingdom
as
long
as
he
reigned
he
had
twenty
ministers
which
is
an
office
that
amongst
these
people
is
generally
held
only
by
one
person
this
king
was
very
wise
he
was
well
versed
in
all
his
duties
and
possessed
such
good
talents
and
qualities
that
they
called
him
pinarao
which
amongst
them
in
the
language
of
canara
means
a
very
wise
man
this
king
was
killed
by
treason
by
the
hand
of
a
nephew
whom
he
had
brought
up
in
his
house
like
a
son
who
thus
caused
the
death
of
the
king
the
nephew
resolved
to
marry
and
for
the
feasts
at
his
wedding
he
prayed
the
king
his
uncle
that
he
would
command
that
he
should
be
attended
and
honoured
at
his
wedding
by
the
king
own
son
and
the
king
for
the
love
that
he
bore
him
and
the
pleasure
that
he
had
in
honouring
him
bade
his
son
make
ready
with
his
following
and
sent
him
with
the
ministers
and
captains
of
his
court
to
attend
and
honour
the
wedding
of
his
nephew
and
he
making
all
ready
as
soon
as
they
were
in
his
house
being
at
table
they
were
all
slain
by
daggers
thrust
by
men
kept
in
readiness
for
that
deed
this
was
done
without
any
one
suspecting
it
because
the
custom
there
is
to
place
on
the
table
all
that
there
is
to
eat
and
drink
no
man
being
present
to
serve
those
who
are
seated
nor
being
kept
outside
but
only
those
who
are
going
to
eat
and
because
of
their
thus
being
alone
at
table
nothing
of
what
passed
could
be
known
to
the
people
they
had
brought
with
them
and
after
he
had
killed
the
king
son
with
all
the
captains
the
minister
set
out
to
ride
as
if
he
were
going
to
bear
a
present
to
the
king
and
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
he
sent
a
message
to
the
king
saying
that
he
was
there
and
had
brought
him
a
present
according
to
custom
and
the
king
being
at
that
time
at
leisure
and
amusing
himself
with
his
wives
bade
him
enter
and
as
soon
as
he
was
come
to
where
he
stood
he
presented
to
the
king
a
golden
bowl
in
which
he
had
placed
a
dagger
steeped
in
poison
with
which
he
wounded
him
in
many
places
but
the
king
as
he
was
a
man
who
knew
how
to
use
both
sword
and
dagger
better
than
any
one
in
his
kingdom
avoided
by
twists
and
turns
of
his
body
the
thrusts
aimed
at
him
freed
himself
from
him
and
slew
him
with
a
short
sword
that
he
had
and
this
done
he
ordered
a
horse
to
be
saddled
and
mounted
it
and
rode
holding
his
nephew
head
in
his
hand
and
he
took
the
road
to
the
latter
house
apprehending
that
treason
might
have
been
wrought
and
fearing
that
his
son
might
be
dead
and
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
beheld
the
treason
in
very
deed
and
how
wicked
a
deed
his
nephew
had
done
seeing
that
his
son
and
his
principal
captains
were
dead
and
that
the
traitor
might
have
prevailed
against
himself
had
he
had
the
power
in
great
wrath
the
king
commanded
his
men
to
inflict
dreadful
punishments
on
all
found
guilty
of
this
treason
and
indeed
many
who
were
not
so
he
himself
remained
grievously
wounded
with
the
poisoned
wounds
and
he
lasted
only
six
months
and
these
ended
died
of
the
poison
carried
on
the
dagger
after
his
death
a
son
remained
to
him
who
inherited
the
kingdom
and
was
called
and
this
king
as
soon
as
he
began
to
reign
sent
to
call
his
treasurers
and
the
minister
and
the
scribes
of
his
household
and
inquired
of
them
the
revenue
of
his
kingdom
and
learned
how
much
revenue
came
in
yearly
and
his
highness
had
every
year
thirteen
millions
of
gold
this
king
granted
to
the
pagodas
a
fifth
part
of
the
revenue
of
his
kingdom
no
law
is
possible
in
the
country
where
these
pagodas
are
save
only
the
law
of
the
brahmans
which
is
that
of
the
priests
and
so
the
people
suffer
on
the
death
of
this
king
succeeded
a
son
named
verupacarao
as
long
as
he
reigned
he
was
given
over
to
vice
caring
for
nothing
but
women
and
to
fuddle
himself
with
drink
and
amuse
himself
and
never
showed
himself
either
to
his
captains
or
to
his
people
so
that
in
a
short
time
he
lost
that
which
his
forefathers
had
won
and
left
to
him
and
the
nobles
of
the
kingdom
seeing
the
habits
and
life
of
this
king
rebelled
every
one
of
them
each
holding
to
what
he
possessed
so
that
in
his
time
the
king
lost
goa
and
chaull
and
dabull
and
the
other
chief
lands
of
the
realm
this
king
in
mere
sottishness
slew
many
of
his
captains
because
he
dreamed
one
night
that
one
of
his
captains
entered
his
chamber
on
the
next
day
he
had
him
called
telling
him
that
he
had
dreamed
that
night
that
the
captain
had
entered
his
room
to
kill
him
and
for
that
alone
he
had
him
put
to
death
this
king
had
two
sons
already
grown
up
who
seeing
the
wickedness
of
their
father
and
how
he
had
lost
his
kingdom
determined
to
kill
him
as
in
fact
was
done
by
one
of
them
the
elder
who
was
his
heir
and
after
he
had
killed
him
when
they
besought
him
to
be
king
he
said
although
this
kingdom
may
be
mine
by
right
i
do
not
want
it
because
i
killed
my
father
and
did
therein
that
which
i
ought
not
to
have
done
and
have
committed
a
mortal
sin
and
for
that
reason
it
is
not
well
that
such
an
unworthy
son
should
inherit
the
kingdom
take
my
brother
and
let
him
govern
it
since
he
did
not
stain
his
hands
with
his
father
blood
which
was
done
and
the
younger
brother
was
raised
to
the
throne
and
when
they
had
entrusted
the
kingdom
to
him
he
was
advised
by
his
minister
and
captains
that
he
should
slay
his
brother
because
as
the
latter
had
killed
his
father
so
he
would
kill
him
if
desirous
of
so
doing
and
as
it
appeared
to
the
king
that
such
a
thing
might
well
be
he
determined
to
kill
him
and
this
was
at
once
carried
out
and
he
slew
him
with
his
own
hand
so
that
this
man
truly
met
the
end
that
those
meet
with
who
do
such
ill
deeds
this
king
was
called
padearao
and
after
this
was
done
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
habits
of
his
father
and
abandoning
himself
to
his
women
and
not
seeking
to
know
ought
regarding
his
realm
save
only
the
vices
in
which
he
delighted
he
remained
for
the
most
part
in
the
city
one
of
his
captains
who
was
called
narsymgua
who
was
in
some
manner
akin
to
him
seeing
his
mode
of
life
and
knowing
how
ill
it
was
for
the
kingdom
that
he
should
live
and
reign
though
all
was
not
yet
lost
determined
to
attack
him
and
seize
on
his
lands
which
scheme
he
at
once
put
into
force
he
wrote
therefore
and
addressed
the
captains
and
chiefs
of
the
kingdom
saying
how
bad
it
was
for
them
not
to
have
a
king
over
them
who
could
govern
properly
and
how
it
would
be
no
wonder
seeing
the
manner
of
his
life
if
the
king
soon
lost
by
his
bad
government
even
more
than
his
father
had
done
he
made
great
presents
to
all
of
them
so
as
to
gain
their
goodwill
and
when
he
had
thus
attached
many
people
to
himself
he
made
ready
to
attack
bisnaga
where
the
king
dwelt
when
the
king
was
told
of
the
uprising
of
this
captain
narsymgua
how
he
was
approaching
and
seizing
his
lands
and
how
many
people
were
joining
him
he
seemed
unmindful
of
the
loss
he
had
suffered
he
gave
no
heed
to
it
nor
made
ready
but
instead
he
only
him
who
had
brought
the
news
so
that
a
captain
of
the
army
of
this
narsymgua
arrived
at
the
gates
of
bisnaga
and
there
was
not
a
single
man
defending
the
place
and
when
the
king
was
told
of
his
arrival
he
only
said
that
it
could
not
be
then
the
captain
entered
the
city
and
the
king
only
said
that
it
could
not
be
then
he
even
entered
his
palace
and
came
as
far
as
the
doors
of
his
chamber
slaying
some
of
the
women
at
last
the
king
believed
and
seeing
now
how
great
was
the
danger
he
resolved
to
flee
by
the
gates
on
the
other
side
and
so
he
left
his
city
and
palaces
and
fled
when
it
was
known
by
the
captain
that
the
king
had
fled
he
did
not
trouble
to
go
after
him
but
took
possession
of
the
city
and
of
the
treasures
which
he
found
there
and
he
sent
to
acquaint
his
lord
narsymgua
and
after
that
narsymgua
was
raised
to
be
king
and
as
he
had
much
power
and
was
beloved
by
the
people
thenceforward
this
kingdom
of
bisnaga
was
called
the
kingdom
of
narsymga
after
he
was
raised
to
be
king
and
was
obeyed
he
came
to
bisnaga
where
he
did
many
acts
of
justice
and
he
took
the
territories
from
whomsoever
had
contrary
to
right
taken
them
from
the
king
this
king
reigned
years
and
at
his
death
left
all
the
kingdom
in
peace
and
he
regained
all
the
lands
which
the
kings
his
predecessors
had
lost
he
caused
horses
to
be
brought
from
oromuz
and
adeem
into
his
kingdom
and
thereby
gave
great
profit
to
the
merchants
paying
them
for
the
horses
just
as
they
asked
he
took
them
dead
or
alive
at
three
for
a
thousand
pardaos
and
of
those
that
died
at
sea
they
brought
him
the
tail
only
and
he
paid
for
it
just
as
if
it
had
been
alive
at
the
death
of
that
king
there
remained
three
fortresses
which
had
revolted
from
his
rule
and
which
he
was
never
able
to
take
which
were
these
rachol
and
odegary
and
conadolgi
which
have
large
and
rich
territories
and
are
the
principal
forts
in
the
kingdom
at
his
death
he
left
two
sons
and
the
governor
of
the
kingdom
was
nasenaque
who
was
father
of
the
king
that
afterwards
was
king
of
bisnaga
and
this
king
narsymgua
before
he
died
sent
to
call
narsenaque
his
minister
and
held
converse
with
him
telling
him
that
at
his
death
he
would
by
testament
leave
him
to
govern
the
kingdom
until
the
princes
should
be
of
an
age
to
rule
also
he
said
that
all
the
royal
treasures
were
his
alone
and
he
reminded
him
that
he
had
won
this
kingdom
of
narsymgua
at
the
point
of
the
sword
adding
that
now
there
remained
only
three
fortresses
to
be
taken
but
that
for
him
the
time
for
their
capture
was
passed
and
the
king
begged
him
to
keep
good
guard
over
the
kingdom
and
to
deliver
it
up
to
the
princes
to
whichever
of
them
should
prove
himself
most
fitted
for
it
and
after
the
king
death
this
narsenaque
remained
as
governor
and
soon
he
raised
up
the
prince
to
be
king
retaining
in
his
own
hands
the
treasures
and
revenues
and
the
government
of
the
country
at
that
time
a
captain
who
wished
him
ill
determined
to
kill
the
prince
with
a
view
afterwards
to
say
that
narsenaque
had
bidden
him
commit
the
murder
he
being
the
minister
to
whom
the
government
of
the
kingdom
had
been
entrusted
and
he
thought
that
for
this
act
of
treason
narsenaque
would
be
put
to
death
and
he
soon
so
arranged
it
that
the
prince
was
killed
one
night
by
one
of
his
pages
who
had
been
bribed
for
that
purpose
and
who
slew
the
prince
with
a
sword
as
soon
as
narsenaque
heard
that
he
was
dead
and
learned
that
he
himself
was
supposed
to
have
sent
to
kill
him
he
raised
up
another
brother
of
the
late
king
to
be
king
not
being
able
further
to
punish
this
captain
because
he
had
many
relations
until
after
he
had
raised
this
younger
brother
to
be
king
who
was
called
tamarao
he
narsenaque
went
out
one
day
from
the
city
of
bisnaga
towards
nagumdym
saying
that
he
was
going
hunting
leaving
all
his
household
in
the
city
and
after
he
had
arrived
at
this
city
of
nagumdym
he
betook
himself
to
another
called
penagumdim
which
is
leagues
from
that
place
where
he
at
once
made
ready
large
forces
and
many
horses
and
elephants
and
then
sent
to
tell
the
king
tamarao
of
the
cause
of
his
going
relating
to
him
the
treason
that
that
captain
by
name
tymarsaa
had
carried
out
slaying
his
brother
the
king
and
by
whose
death
he
the
prince
had
inherited
the
kingdom
he
told
him
how
that
the
kingdom
had
been
entrusted
to
him
by
his
father
as
well
as
the
care
of
himself
and
his
brother
that
as
this
man
had
killed
his
brother
so
he
would
do
to
him
in
the
same
way
for
he
was
a
traitor
and
he
urged
that
for
that
reason
it
was
necessary
to
punish
him
but
the
king
at
that
time
was
very
fond
of
that
captain
since
by
reason
of
him
he
had
become
king
and
in
place
of
punishing
him
he
bestowed
favour
on
him
and
took
his
part
against
the
minister
and
seeing
this
narsenaque
went
against
him
with
large
forces
and
besieged
him
threatening
him
for
four
or
five
days
until
the
king
seeing
his
determination
commanded
timarsaa
to
be
put
to
death
after
which
he
the
king
sent
the
traitor
head
to
be
shown
to
the
minister
who
greatly
rejoiced
narsenaque
sent
away
all
the
troops
and
entered
the
city
where
he
was
very
well
received
by
all
the
people
by
whom
he
was
much
loved
as
being
a
man
of
much
justice
and
after
some
days
and
years
had
passed
narsenaque
seeing
the
age
of
the
king
how
young
he
was
determined
to
keep
him
in
the
city
of
penagumdy
with
large
guards
to
make
safe
his
person
and
to
give
him
cruzados
of
gold
every
year
for
his
food
and
expenses
and
himself
to
govern
the
kingdom
for
it
had
been
entrusted
to
him
by
the
king
his
lord
so
to
do
after
this
had
been
done
he
told
the
king
that
he
desired
to
go
to
bisnaga
to
do
certain
things
that
would
tend
to
the
benefit
of
the
kingdom
and
the
king
pleased
at
that
told
him
that
so
it
should
be
thinking
that
now
he
himself
would
be
more
his
own
master
and
not
be
so
liable
to
be
checked
by
him
and
after
he
had
departed
and
arrived
at
bisnaga
narsenaque
sent
the
king
men
for
his
guard
as
he
had
arranged
and
he
sent
as
their
captain
timapanarque
a
man
in
whom
he
much
confided
commanding
him
that
he
should
not
allow
the
king
to
leave
the
city
and
that
he
should
carefully
guard
his
person
against
treachery
and
after
this
was
done
narsenaque
began
to
make
war
on
several
places
taking
them
and
demolishing
them
because
they
had
revolted
at
that
time
it
was
proposed
by
some
captains
that
they
should
kill
the
king
as
he
was
not
a
man
fitted
to
govern
but
to
this
narsenaque
would
answer
nothing
after
some
days
had
passed
however
narsenaque
pondering
on
the
treason
about
which
they
had
spoken
to
him
how
it
would
increase
his
greatness
and
more
easily
make
him
lord
of
the
kingdom
of
which
he
was
only
minister
called
one
day
those
same
captains
who
had
often
proposed
it
to
him
and
asked
them
by
what
means
the
king
could
be
slain
without
its
being
known
that
he
had
had
a
hand
in
his
death
then
one
man
told
him
that
a
very
good
way
would
be
that
he
the
minister
should
appear
to
be
annoyed
with
him
and
should
send
to
command
his
presence
which
mandate
he
would
not
obey
and
on
account
of
this
act
of
disrespect
he
the
minister
should
ordain
that
some
punishment
be
inflicted
and
at
this
aggravation
he
would
leave
the
city
and
fly
to
penagundy
to
stir
up
the
king
against
the
minister
he
said
that
after
he
had
gained
the
goodwill
of
the
king
he
would
so
plot
against
him
that
he
would
render
him
disobedient
and
that
to
give
the
king
greater
encouragement
he
would
forge
letters
as
if
from
captains
which
should
contain
the
same
counsel
namely
that
he
should
leave
that
city
where
he
was
more
prisoner
than
free
and
would
point
out
to
him
that
he
alone
was
king
and
lord
and
yet
that
the
land
was
under
the
power
of
narasenaque
his
vassal
who
had
made
himself
very
strong
and
powerful
in
the
kingdom
and
held
him
the
king
prisoner
and
had
rebelled
he
would
urge
the
king
to
secretly
quit
the
city
and
betake
himself
to
a
fortress
belonging
to
the
captain
who
had
sent
him
that
letter
and
that
there
he
should
prepare
himself
getting
together
a
large
following
and
he
would
tell
him
that
when
the
lords
and
captains
came
to
know
of
his
wish
and
determination
they
would
act
according
to
it
and
would
help
him
and
would
come
with
him
to
fall
upon
narsenayque
and
would
bestow
upon
him
narsenaque
the
prison
in
which
he
the
king
was
now
kept
so
he
would
be
king
the
captain
further
said
that
after
he
had
persuaded
the
king
to
this
he
would
cause
him
to
leave
the
city
and
while
going
out
he
would
kill
him
and
that
in
this
way
narsenaque
should
become
king
narsenayque
was
well
pleased
to
listen
to
this
treason
and
to
hear
of
the
evil
deed
which
this
captain
planned
and
he
showed
him
much
favour
the
captain
disappeared
after
some
days
from
where
narsenayque
was
feigning
to
have
fled
and
he
came
to
penagumdy
where
in
a
few
days
his
arrival
was
known
and
he
set
about
and
put
in
hand
all
those
things
that
had
been
arranged
every
day
he
showed
the
king
a
letter
one
day
from
a
captain
of
one
fortress
the
next
day
another
from
another
captain
and
the
king
understanding
the
plots
contained
in
the
letters
so
shown
replied
that
the
counsel
and
advice
seemed
good
and
yet
how
could
he
resist
the
power
of
narsenayque
who
besides
being
minister
of
the
kingdom
had
possession
of
all
the
horses
and
elephants
and
treasure
so
that
he
could
at
once
make
war
against
him
true
it
is
sire
that
which
thou
sayest
answered
the
traitor
and
yet
he
is
much
misliked
by
all
the
captains
who
raised
thee
to
be
king
and
as
soon
as
they
shall
see
thee
in
chaodagary
which
was
a
fortress
whither
he
had
advised
him
to
flee
being
one
which
up
to
that
time
was
independent
all
will
flock
to
thine
aid
since
they
esteem
it
a
just
cause
said
the
king
since
this
is
so
how
dost
thou
propose
that
i
should
leave
this
place
so
that
my
going
should
not
be
known
to
the
guards
and
to
the
men
who
surround
me
in
this
city
sire
he
replied
i
will
disclose
to
thee
a
very
good
plan
thou
and
i
will
go
forth
by
this
thy
garden
and
from
thence
by
a
postern
gate
which
is
in
the
city
wall
and
which
i
know
well
and
the
guards
seeing
thee
alone
without
any
following
will
not
know
that
it
is
thou
the
king
and
thus
we
shall
pass
to
the
outside
of
the
city
where
i
will
have
horses
ready
that
will
take
us
whithersoever
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
all
this
pleased
the
king
well
and
he
placed
everything
in
his
hands
and
seeing
fulfilled
all
his
desire
the
captain
spoke
with
those
men
who
guarded
that
part
of
the
garden
by
which
he
wished
that
the
king
should
fly
and
which
was
near
the
king
own
houses
for
into
this
garden
the
king
often
went
to
amuse
himself
with
his
wives
which
garden
was
at
that
part
guarded
by
a
matter
of
armed
men
and
to
these
men
he
spoke
thus
saying
to
them
if
ye
shall
happen
to
see
me
pass
by
here
on
such
a
night
and
at
such
an
hour
and
if
ye
shall
see
a
man
coming
with
me
slay
him
for
he
well
deserves
it
of
me
and
i
will
reward
ye
and
they
all
said
that
that
would
be
a
very
small
service
to
do
for
him
when
that
day
had
passed
the
traitor
went
to
the
king
and
said
to
him
sire
do
not
put
off
till
that
which
thou
hast
to
do
for
i
have
the
horses
ready
for
thy
escape
and
have
planned
so
to
escort
thee
forth
that
even
thy
ladies
shall
not
be
aware
of
thy
departure
nor
any
other
person
come
sire
to
the
garden
where
i
will
await
thee
the
king
replied
that
his
words
were
good
and
so
he
would
do
and
as
soon
as
night
was
come
and
the
hour
arrived
the
king
went
carefully
out
and
still
more
careful
was
he
who
for
some
time
had
awaited
him
and
he
gave
signal
to
the
armed
men
and
as
soon
as
he
was
come
to
the
garden
he
passed
between
two
of
them
who
were
the
guards
and
they
threw
themselves
on
the
king
and
slew
him
and
forthwith
buried
him
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
the
same
garden
and
this
being
accomplished
without
their
knowing
whom
they
had
slain
the
traitor
gave
them
his
thanks
and
returned
to
his
inn
to
make
ready
to
leave
the
city
and
also
so
as
not
to
give
cause
for
talk
therein
and
the
next
morning
it
was
found
that
the
king
was
missing
and
though
searched
for
throughout
all
the
city
no
news
of
him
could
be
heard
all
the
people
thinking
that
he
had
fled
somewhere
whence
he
would
make
war
on
narsenayque
and
to
narsenayque
the
news
was
straightway
brought
and
he
feigning
much
sorrow
at
it
yet
made
ready
all
his
horses
and
elephants
in
case
the
kingdom
should
be
plunged
into
some
revolution
by
the
death
of
the
king
although
as
yet
he
knew
not
for
certain
how
the
matter
stood
save
that
the
king
had
disappeared
and
afterwards
the
man
came
who
had
killed
the
king
and
told
him
how
it
had
been
done
and
how
secretly
he
had
been
slain
so
that
even
the
very
men
who
had
killed
him
knew
not
who
it
was
and
narsenayque
bestowed
upon
him
rich
reward
and
since
there
was
no
news
of
the
king
and
he
holding
everything
now
under
his
hand
he
was
raised
to
be
king
over
all
the
land
of
narsymga
and
this
king
left
at
his
death
five
sons
one
was
called
busbalrao
and
another
crismarao
and
another
tetarao
and
another
ramygupa
and
another
ouamysyuaya
and
this
busbalrao
inherited
the
kingdom
at
the
death
of
his
father
narsenayque
and
reigned
six
years
during
which
he
was
always
at
war
for
as
soon
as
his
father
was
dead
the
whole
land
revolted
under
its
captains
who
in
a
short
time
were
destroyed
by
that
king
and
their
lands
taken
and
reduced
under
his
rule
during
these
six
years
the
king
spent
in
restoring
the
country
to
its
former
condition
eight
million
gold
pardaos
this
king
died
of
his
sickness
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
and
before
he
died
he
sent
for
salvatimya
his
minister
and
commanded
to
be
brought
to
him
his
the
king
son
eight
years
old
and
said
to
sallvatina
that
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
he
must
raise
up
this
son
to
be
king
though
he
was
not
of
an
age
for
that
and
though
the
kingdom
ought
perhaps
to
belong
to
his
brother
crisnarao
and
that
he
must
put
out
the
eyes
of
the
latter
and
must
bring
them
to
show
him
in
order
that
after
his
death
there
should
be
no
differences
in
the
kingdom
salvatina
said
that
he
would
do
so
and
departed
and
sent
to
call
for
crisnarao
and
took
him
aside
to
a
stable
and
told
him
how
his
brother
had
bade
him
put
out
his
eyes
and
make
his
son
king
when
he
heard
this
crisnarao
said
that
he
did
not
seek
to
be
king
nor
to
be
anything
in
the
kingdom
even
though
it
should
come
to
him
by
right
that
his
desire
was
to
pass
through
this
world
as
a
jogi
ascetic
recluse
and
that
he
should
not
put
his
eyes
out
seeing
that
he
had
not
deserved
that
of
his
brother
sallvatina
hearing
this
and
seeing
that
crisnarao
was
a
man
of
over
twenty
years
and
therefore
more
fit
to
be
king
as
you
will
see
farther
on
than
the
son
of
busbalrao
who
was
only
eight
years
old
commanded
to
bring
a
and
he
put
out
its
eyes
and
took
them
to
show
the
king
for
already
he
was
at
the
last
hour
of
his
life
and
he
presented
them
to
him
and
as
soon
as
the
king
was
dead
his
brother
crisnarao
was
raised
to
be
king
whose
eyes
the
late
king
had
ordered
to
be
torn
out
chapter
of
the
things
done
by
king
crisnarao
after
he
was
raised
to
the
throne
as
soon
as
crisnarao
was
raised
to
be
king
and
was
obeyed
throughout
all
his
kingdom
salvatine
being
his
minister
who
had
been
the
same
for
his
brother
busbalrao
he
without
delay
sent
his
nephew
son
of
busbalrao
his
brother
together
with
his
own
three
brothers
to
a
fortress
called
chaodegary
the
nephew
remained
there
till
he
died
and
after
the
king
had
done
this
for
his
own
safety
he
stayed
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
for
a
year
and
a
half
without
going
outside
of
it
learning
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
and
looking
at
the
testaments
of
past
kings
amongst
these
he
found
one
of
king
narsymga
whose
minister
his
father
narsenayque
had
been
in
which
that
king
desired
that
his
sons
or
whoever
should
inherit
this
kingdom
of
narsymga
which
he
had
gained
by
force
of
arms
should
capture
three
fortresses
that
at
his
death
remained
in
revolt
against
him
the
which
he
had
not
himself
taken
because
time
failed
him
one
of
them
was
called
rracholl
and
another
medegulla
crisnarao
seeing
this
testament
and
seeing
how
badly
the
kings
his
predecessors
had
acted
in
what
had
been
enjoined
on
them
determined
at
once
to
prepare
armies
and
to
go
against
these
places
and
one
of
these
fortresses
was
called
odigair
and
it
belonged
to
the
king
of
orya
and
determining
to
go
first
against
this
he
collected
an
army
of
thousand
foot
and
eight
hundred
elephants
and
arrived
with
this
force
at
the
city
of
digary
in
which
there
were
ten
thousand
foot
soldiers
and
four
hundred
horse
for
the
fortress
had
no
necessity
for
more
by
reason
of
its
great
strength
because
it
could
not
be
taken
except
by
being
starved
out
and
the
king
laid
siege
to
it
for
a
year
and
a
half
in
which
time
he
made
many
paths
across
rocky
hills
breaking
up
many
great
boulders
in
order
to
make
a
road
for
his
soldiers
to
approach
the
towers
of
the
fortress
the
place
at
this
time
was
so
strong
that
they
could
not
approach
it
except
by
one
way
which
was
so
narrow
that
men
could
only
pass
along
it
one
at
a
time
and
in
this
place
he
made
a
broad
road
and
many
others
also
so
that
he
could
come
close
to
the
fortress
and
he
took
it
by
force
of
arms
and
in
it
captured
an
aunt
of
the
king
of
orya
who
was
taken
captive
and
carried
off
with
all
the
courtesy
that
he
could
show
her
having
her
liberty
and
he
took
her
along
with
himself
and
after
this
was
done
he
called
salvatinya
and
bade
him
see
how
well
he
had
performed
that
which
king
narsymga
had
by
his
testament
enjoined
on
him
and
yet
he
said
he
was
not
content
with
such
a
trivial
victory
for
he
desired
to
go
forward
a
hundred
leagues
into
the
kingdom
of
orya
and
he
ordered
him
to
make
ready
provisions
and
pay
fully
the
salaries
of
the
forces
and
after
this
fortress
was
taken
he
departed
and
went
against
comdovy
which
was
one
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
kingdom
of
orya
and
besieged
it
and
learning
this
the
king
of
orya
came
against
him
to
defend
his
territories
and
brought
with
him
one
thousand
three
hundred
elephants
and
twenty
thousand
horsemen
and
he
brought
five
hundred
thousand
crisnarao
being
aware
of
the
approach
of
the
king
of
orya
left
the
city
without
assaulting
it
saying
that
he
preferred
to
fight
the
king
in
person
and
his
army
rather
than
to
attack
the
city
and
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
afterwards
to
take
it
and
he
went
forward
four
leagues
from
it
leaving
a
force
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
people
from
the
city
if
they
should
seek
to
flee
to
the
coast
and
he
arrived
at
a
large
river
of
salt
water
crossed
by
a
ford
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
the
king
of
orya
with
his
army
king
crisnarao
halted
his
army
on
this
side
of
the
river
and
sent
the
king
a
message
that
if
he
desired
to
fight
with
him
he
would
retire
from
the
river
two
leagues
so
that
he
the
king
of
orya
might
pass
the
river
unmolested
and
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
he
would
join
battle
to
which
message
the
king
of
orya
gave
no
reply
but
on
the
contrary
made
ready
to
give
battle
and
king
crisnarao
seeing
his
determination
crossed
the
river
with
all
his
forces
and
elephants
and
in
the
crossing
of
the
river
there
were
heavy
encounters
on
both
sides
and
many
were
slain
notwithstanding
this
king
crisnarao
crossed
the
river
and
on
the
bank
fought
so
bravely
that
he
defeated
the
king
of
oria
and
put
him
to
flight
in
which
defeat
he
took
many
horses
and
elephants
and
after
the
king
had
done
this
he
told
salvatinea
his
minister
that
he
purposed
to
turn
back
to
the
fortress
which
had
not
yet
experienced
his
strength
and
he
went
against
it
and
stopped
there
two
months
besieging
it
and
he
took
it
and
he
gave
the
command
of
it
to
salvatinea
who
left
in
it
from
his
army
for
captain
one
of
his
brothers
in
order
that
he
himself
might
go
forward
with
the
king
through
the
kingdom
of
orya
and
the
king
passing
the
river
once
more
in
pursuit
of
the
king
of
orya
and
taking
and
ravaging
all
the
country
which
had
no
reason
for
expecting
him
arrived
at
a
city
called
comdepallyr
where
were
all
the
chiefs
of
the
kingdom
it
being
the
chief
city
in
that
kingdom
and
he
laid
siege
to
it
and
remained
there
three
months
without
being
able
to
capture
it
and
in
the
end
he
took
it
more
by
reason
of
his
numbers
than
by
force
of
arms
in
which
fortress
he
found
many
people
of
high
rank
whom
he
made
captive
amongst
whom
was
a
wife
of
the
king
and
one
of
his
sons
who
was
a
prince
and
seven
principal
captains
of
the
kingdom
all
of
whom
he
sent
by
road
to
bysnaga
and
he
went
forward
a
hundred
leagues
into
the
kingdom
finding
no
one
to
bar
his
progress
till
he
got
to
symamdary
which
was
a
very
large
city
in
which
he
halted
for
six
months
waiting
for
the
king
of
orya
he
sent
many
messages
to
say
that
he
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
field
but
he
never
came
and
in
this
city
he
did
many
works
and
gave
alms
to
the
temples
and
erected
therein
a
very
grand
temple
to
which
he
gave
much
revenue
and
he
commanded
to
engrave
on
it
an
inscription
which
says
perhaps
when
these
letters
are
decayed
the
king
of
orya
will
give
battle
to
the
king
of
bisnaga
if
the
king
of
orya
erases
them
his
wife
shall
be
given
to
the
smiths
who
shoe
the
horses
of
the
king
of
bisnaga
and
after
this
was
done
he
returned
leaving
the
greater
part
of
those
lands
to
the
temples
and
came
to
bisnaga
where
he
rested
some
days
and
he
sent
to
call
the
son
of
the
king
of
orya
who
was
taken
captive
in
the
first
fortress
and
told
him
that
as
people
said
that
he
was
a
very
active
man
and
was
very
dexterous
with
both
sword
and
dagger
he
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
fence
the
young
man
said
that
since
his
highness
summoned
him
he
would
do
what
he
could
and
asked
that
this
might
be
put
off
till
next
day
and
when
the
next
day
came
the
king
sent
to
call
him
and
also
sent
for
one
of
his
own
men
who
at
that
time
was
very
expert
in
the
art
that
he
should
fence
with
him
and
when
the
son
of
the
king
of
orya
saw
him
being
offended
with
the
king
for
sending
a
man
to
fight
with
him
who
was
not
the
son
of
a
king
but
only
a
man
of
humble
birth
he
cried
out
to
the
king
god
forbid
that
i
should
soil
my
hands
by
touching
a
man
not
of
the
blood
royal
and
saying
this
he
slew
himself
and
his
father
hearing
how
his
son
was
dead
wrote
to
salvatinea
asking
by
what
means
he
could
ransom
his
wife
who
remained
in
the
power
of
the
king
since
his
son
was
dead
to
which
he
made
answer
that
he
should
arrange
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
with
the
king
and
that
afterwards
the
king
would
restore
him
his
wife
and
lands
or
would
take
only
his
lands
this
counsel
he
accepted
and
he
sent
ambassadors
to
bisnaga
to
arrange
a
marriage
with
his
daughter
with
which
king
crisnarao
was
well
content
and
when
the
king
of
orya
knew
his
will
in
the
matter
he
sent
him
his
daughter
and
with
the
coming
of
her
they
were
friends
and
crisnarao
restored
the
lands
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
kept
those
on
the
hither
side
for
himself
chapter
how
crisnarao
after
he
had
made
peace
with
the
king
of
oria
determined
to
go
against
the
land
of
catuir
after
crisnarao
had
made
peace
and
had
married
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
oria
and
had
restored
to
him
his
wife
and
the
lands
beyond
the
river
as
has
been
narrated
above
he
made
ready
a
large
army
and
prepared
to
attack
catuir
which
is
the
land
of
a
lord
who
had
been
in
revolt
for
fifty
years
this
land
is
on
the
charamaodel
side
and
he
went
against
it
and
laid
siege
to
one
of
the
principal
cities
where
the
lord
of
the
land
was
and
it
is
called
and
is
surrounded
with
water
now
at
the
time
when
crisnarao
attacked
this
city
it
was
winter
for
which
cause
the
river
that
surrounded
it
was
so
swollen
and
carried
down
so
much
water
that
the
king
could
do
no
harm
to
the
place
and
king
crisnarao
seeing
this
and
seeing
that
time
was
passing
away
without
his
attaining
his
desire
commanded
his
men
to
cut
many
new
channels
in
order
to
be
able
to
attack
that
principal
river
which
had
opposed
itself
to
the
fulfilment
of
his
wishes
and
this
was
done
in
a
short
time
since
he
had
many
soldiers
and
after
the
new
watercourses
were
finished
and
brought
to
where
the
water
should
go
he
opened
mouths
in
the
river
the
water
of
which
very
soon
flowed
out
so
that
the
bottom
could
be
seen
and
it
was
left
so
shallow
that
it
enabled
him
to
reach
the
walls
of
the
city
and
the
river
was
thus
diverted
into
fifty
different
beds
inside
the
city
were
one
hundred
thousand
and
three
thousand
cavalry
who
defended
themselves
and
fought
very
bravely
but
this
availed
little
to
prevent
crisnarao
from
entering
in
a
few
days
and
slaughtering
all
of
them
he
found
large
treasures
in
this
city
amongst
others
in
ready
money
a
million
and
six
hundred
thousand
golden
pardaos
besides
jewels
and
horses
which
were
numerous
and
elephants
and
after
he
had
finished
the
capture
of
this
land
crisnarao
divided
it
amongst
many
of
his
captains
giving
to
each
one
what
was
necessary
for
him
and
the
chief
who
lived
in
the
city
and
who
was
lord
of
the
land
was
taken
away
captive
and
carried
to
bisnaga
where
he
died
in
the
king
prison
and
after
the
king
had
settled
the
country
he
came
to
bisnaga
whence
he
sent
salvatinea
to
the
city
of
comdovy
since
he
was
chief
of
it
by
whom
his
brother
was
placed
in
it
so
as
to
see
directly
to
the
land
and
ifs
government
for
after
the
king
returned
from
orya
he
never
went
again
thither
and
salvatinea
having
departed
on
his
journey
to
comdovy
before
he
arrived
there
met
opposing
his
path
a
muhammadan
named
madarmeluquo
who
was
a
captain
of
the
king
on
this
side
and
who
was
awaiting
him
with
sixty
thousand
men
salvatinea
had
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
had
very
little
fear
of
him
and
with
these
he
went
against
him
and
took
and
defeated
him
and
took
prisoners
himself
and
his
wife
and
son
and
horses
and
elephants
and
much
money
and
store
of
jewels
and
sent
them
all
to
king
crisnarao
the
king
commanded
to
put
the
captives
in
prison
and
there
they
died
and
sallvatinea
went
to
his
territories
and
after
he
had
stayed
there
some
months
and
seen
to
its
government
and
decided
matters
in
dispute
he
returned
to
the
king
at
bisnaga
by
whom
he
was
well
received
as
being
the
principal
person
in
the
kingdom
chapter
how
crisnarao
on
the
arrival
of
salvatinia
determined
to
attack
rachol
a
city
of
the
ydalcao
and
to
break
the
peace
that
had
lasted
so
long
and
the
reason
why
after
salvatinia
had
arrived
and
had
been
well
received
by
the
king
and
after
the
lapse
of
some
days
the
king
told
him
that
he
desired
to
fulfil
all
the
wishes
expressed
in
the
testament
of
king
narsynga
one
of
which
was
to
capture
rachol
which
was
a
very
strong
city
and
amongst
the
principal
ones
of
the
ydallcao
who
had
taken
it
from
the
kings
his
ancestors
and
because
there
was
now
peace
between
both
parties
and
had
been
so
for
forty
years
he
knew
not
how
he
could
manage
to
break
it
but
salvatinia
said
that
since
the
peace
had
been
made
under
certain
conditions
one
of
which
was
that
if
on
either
one
side
or
the
other
any
captains
in
revolt
or
other
should
be
harboured
and
their
surrender
should
be
demanded
they
should
forthwith
be
given
up
there
was
now
great
reason
for
breaking
the
peace
since
many
and
debtors
to
his
highness
had
tied
into
the
kingdom
of
the
ydallcao
he
counselled
therefore
that
the
king
should
send
to
demand
the
surrender
of
these
men
and
that
on
refusal
to
give
them
up
there
would
be
good
ground
for
breaking
the
peace
many
however
disagreed
with
this
advice
now
it
happened
at
this
time
that
the
king
of
bisnaga
sent
cide
mercar
with
forty
thousand
pardaos
to
goa
to
buy
horses
which
cide
mercar
was
a
moor
in
whom
the
king
of
bisnaga
confided
on
account
of
various
affairs
with
which
he
had
already
been
entrusted
and
this
man
when
he
arrived
at
a
place
where
the
moors
lived
which
was
called
pomdaa
and
is
two
leagues
from
goa
fled
from
that
place
pomdaa
to
the
ydallcao
carrying
with
him
all
the
treasure
some
say
that
the
ydallcao
wrote
to
him
a
letter
as
soon
as
he
got
there
as
soon
as
they
gave
to
the
king
this
news
of
the
flight
of
cide
and
how
he
had
carried
off
all
the
money
he
said
that
he
would
write
to
the
ydallcao
to
send
the
man
back
to
him
with
all
the
money
since
he
was
his
friend
then
the
king
caused
a
letter
to
be
written
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
friendship
that
had
existed
for
so
many
years
so
that
nothing
could
shake
it
and
that
he
hoped
that
a
traitor
would
not
be
the
cause
of
breaking
a
peace
of
such
long
standing
as
had
been
between
them
and
he
begged
that
he
would
send
cide
back
at
once
as
soon
as
the
letter
was
read
to
the
ydallcao
he
sent
to
summon
his
kazis
and
the
men
of
his
council
and
he
bade
them
read
the
letter
which
had
come
from
the
king
as
to
which
letter
there
were
many
suggestions
made
at
the
end
of
all
they
agreed
that
he
should
not
send
him
cide
to
him
the
king
of
bisnaga
for
they
said
that
he
cide
was
one
learned
in
the
law
and
related
to
mafumdo
and
the
ydallcao
as
a
cloak
to
his
action
gave
dabull
to
that
cide
by
way
of
showing
that
he
was
not
near
his
person
nor
knew
he
aught
of
him
from
which
town
of
dabull
cide
fled
nor
had
they
any
further
news
of
him
when
those
who
had
come
from
the
king
returned
bearing
the
ydallcao
answer
the
king
showed
great
indignation
at
it
and
held
that
the
peace
was
broken
he
at
once
ordered
to
appear
before
him
the
great
lords
of
his
council
and
had
the
letter
read
aloud
so
that
all
might
hear
as
soon
as
it
was
read
he
said
that
without
more
ado
they
should
make
ready
since
he
was
determined
to
take
full
vengeance
but
the
councillors
advised
the
king
saying
that
for
such
a
small
sum
of
money
as
this
it
was
not
well
so
to
act
that
he
should
think
of
what
would
be
said
and
talked
of
throughout
the
world
and
that
if
he
was
bent
on
breaking
so
prolonged
a
peace
for
such
a
trifling
cause
he
should
call
to
mind
that
there
never
was
any
honesty
in
a
moor
that
others
were
to
blame
in
that
which
cide
had
done
and
that
if
cide
should
dare
to
come
to
that
war
which
was
waged
in
order
to
take
vengeance
on
him
then
it
would
be
well
that
those
who
accompanied
him
should
die
but
that
they
knew
that
cide
would
keep
well
away
from
the
army
the
councillors
however
saw
that
the
king
remained
unmoved
from
his
determination
to
make
war
and
they
then
counselled
him
saying
sire
do
not
go
to
war
by
that
route
dabull
but
go
against
rachol
which
now
belongs
to
the
ydallcao
but
of
old
was
part
of
this
kingdom
then
the
ydallcao
will
be
forced
to
come
to
defend
it
and
thus
thou
wilt
take
vengeance
jointly
both
on
one
and
the
other
the
king
held
this
advice
to
be
good
and
prepared
for
his
departure
sending
letters
to
madre
maluco
and
demellyno
and
desturvirido
and
other
superior
lords
giving
them
an
account
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
matter
of
the
ydallcao
and
how
he
had
determined
to
make
war
on
him
from
which
lords
he
received
answer
that
he
was
doing
rightly
and
that
they
would
assist
him
as
far
as
they
were
able
as
to
the
zemelluco
at
the
time
when
the
messengers
returned
this
answer
he
could
find
no
excuse
for
not
sending
some
troops
to
the
aid
of
his
sister
who
was
wedded
to
the
ydallcao
the
king
had
sent
the
letters
to
those
lords
out
of
his
great
craftiness
for
he
told
them
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
in
order
to
seduce
them
to
his
side
so
far
at
least
as
concerned
their
goodwill
seeing
that
in
the
matter
of
troops
he
had
no
need
of
them
because
if
they
had
joined
the
ydallcao
he
the
king
would
never
have
conquered
as
he
did
but
because
the
ydallcao
was
hated
by
them
all
as
being
a
more
powerful
chief
than
they
for
there
is
little
faith
amongst
the
moors
and
they
bite
one
another
like
dogs
and
like
to
see
one
after
the
other
destroyed
he
was
conquered
as
you
will
see
hereafter
in
the
month
of
may
on
the
new
moon
day
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
after
the
king
had
made
his
offerings
and
performed
sacrifices
to
his
idols
he
left
the
city
of
bisnaga
with
all
his
troops
and
they
marched
in
the
following
order
the
chief
of
the
guard
o
porteiro
moor
led
the
advance
with
thirty
thousand
infantry
archers
men
with
shields
and
musqueteers
and
spearmen
and
a
thousand
horse
and
his
elephants
after
him
went

with
fifty
thousand

and
two
thousand

and
twenty
elephants
after
him
went

he
had
with

and
after
him
went
adapanayque
with

and
fifty

after
him
came
comdamara
and
he
had
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand

six
thousand
horse
and
sixty
elephants
after
him
went
comara
and
he
had
eighty
thousand
foot
and
of
horse
two
thousand
five
hundred
and
forty
elephants
after
him
the
forces
of
ogemdraho
the
governor
of
the
city
of
bisnaga
with
one
of
his
captains
who
had
one
thousand
horse
and
thirty
thousand
foot
and
ten
elephants
after
him
went
three
eunuchs
favourites
of
the
king
who
had
forty
thousand
foot
and
one
thousand
horse
and
fifteen
elephants
the
page
who
served
the
king
with
betel
had
fifteen
thousand
foot
and
two
hundred
horse
but
he
had
no
elephants
comarberca
had
eight
thousand
foot
and
four
hundred
horse
and
twenty
elephants
the
people
of
the
chief
of
bengapor
went
by
another
route
with
the
people
of
domar
who
were
very
numerous
and
in
the
same
way
went
other
captains
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
men
of
whom
i
make
no
mention
not
knowing
their
names
the
king
took
of
his
guard
six
thousand
horse
and
forty
thousand
foot
the
pick
of
all
his
kingdom
men
with
shields
archers
and
three
hundred
elephants
all
were
equally
well
armed
each
after
his
own
fashion
the
archers
and
musqueteers
with
their
quilted
tunics
and
the
shieldmen
with
their
swords
and
poignards
in
their
girdles
the
shields
are
so
large
that
there
is
no
need
for
armour
to
protect
the
body
which
is
completely
covered
the
horses
in
full
clothing
and
the
men
with
doublets
and
weapons
in
their
hands
and
on
their
heads
headpieces
after
the
manner
of
their
doublets
quilted
with
cotton
the
go
with
their
howdahs
castellos
from
which
four
men
fight
on
each
side
of
them
and
the
elephants
are
completely
clothed
and
on
their
tusks
they
have
knives
fastened
much
ground
and
sharpened
with
which
they
do
great
harm
several
cannon
were
also
taken
i
do
not
speak
here
of
the
washermen
who
are
numberless
here
they
wash
clothes
nor
of
the
public
women
who
accompanied
the
army
there
were
twenty
thousand
of
them
with
the
king
during
his
journey
any
one
can
imagine
the
amount
of
baggage
that
such
a
large
number
of
people
would
take
in
the
rear
with
the
king
but
always
on
the
road
in
front
of
him
some
ten
or
twelve
thousand
men
with
who
go
seeking
water
and
place
themselves
along
the
road
to
give
water
to
those
who
have
no
one
to
bring
it
to
them
this
is
done
so
that
none
of
the
people
should
die
of
thirst
three
or
four
leagues
in
front
of
all
this
multitude
go
some
fifty
thousand
men
who
are
like
scouts
they
have
to
spy
out
the
country
in
front
and
always
keep
that
distance
and
on
their
flanks
there
are
two
thousand
horse
of
the
cavalry
of
that
country
these
are
all
bowmen
and
they
always
advance
on
the
flanks
of
the
scouts
in
this
order
as
i
have
stated
they
left
the
city
of
bisnaga
and
with
them
a
great
number
of
merchants
besides
many
others
who
were
already
in
advance
with
all
supplies
so
that
wherever
you
may
be
you
will
at
once
find
all
you
want
every
captain
has
his
merchants
who
are
compelled
to
give
him
all
supplies
requisite
for
all
his
people
and
in
the
same
way
they
carry
all
other
necessaries
according
to
the
king
custom
when
he
wishes
to
lie
down
and
sleep
they
make
for
him
a
hedge
of
and
of
thorns
behind
which
his
tent
is
pitched
which
was
done
for
him
all
along
this
route
on
which
route
was
seen
a
wonderful
thing
namely
that
on
passing
a
river
which
when
they
reached
it
came
up
to
the
knee
before
half
the
people
had
passed
it
was
totally
dry
without
a
drop
of
water
and
they
went
about
in
the
sand
of
it
making
pits
to
find
some
water
in
this
order
the
king
proceeded
till
he
arrived
at
the
town
of
mollabamdym
which
is
a
league
from
the
city
of
rachol
where
he
pitched
his
camp
so
as
to
give
a
rest
to
the
people
after
the
fatigues
of
the
march
and
the
king
being
in
the
city
of
mollabamdyn
settling
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
siege
of
rachol
there
came
to
him
people
of
the
king
of
bisnaga
and
the
people
of
domaar
and
also
many
other
captains
with
an
infinitude
of
people
as
soon
as
they
had
joined
and
everything
was
put
in
order
and
after
his
brahmans
had
finished
their
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
they
told
the
king
that
it
was
now
time
that
the
pagodas
had
given
sign
of
conquest
and
that
he
should
advance
then
he
sent
the
moors
in
the
royal
service
to
lead
the
van
and
camanayque
the
chief
of
the
guard
pitched
the
camp
very
near
the
ditches
of
the
city
of
rachol
and
every
captain
halted
his
people
according
to
the
commands
given
the
people
of
the
city
received
them
with
many
shots
from
heavy
cannon
that
they
had
and
from
many
firelocks
and
many
arrows
and
so
that
those
of
the
besiegers
who
arrived
close
to
the
ditches
suffered
heavily
and
wanted
to
retreat
but
the
king
would
not
permit
this
saying
that
he
would
not
have
sent
them
there
were
it
not
that
he
would
soon
effect
an
entry
into
the
city
and
if
not
that
they
should
all
die
wherefore
his
men
were
compelled
to
attack
the
city
and
did
so
in
many
brave
and
severe
fights
in
these
many
of
them
lost
their
lives
since
those
of
the
city
were
in
very
strong
position
and
well
acquainted
with
everything
that
was
necessary
for
their
defence
while
the
king
troops
never
ceased
their
attacks
on
the
city
the
captains
seeing
how
badly
the
attack
was
going
in
consequence
of
the
number
of
soldiers
killed
had
recourse
to
lavish
gifts
and
stratagems
as
thus
they
began
to
buy
from
the
soldiers
the
stones
which
they
took
from
the
walls
and
towers
and
they
paid
them
according
to
the
value
of
the
stone
so
that
the
stones
were
worth
ten
twenty
thirty
forty
and
fifty
fanams
by
this
device
they
contrived
to
dismantle
the
wall
in
many
places
and
laid
the
city
open
but
since
the
city
was
in
itself
so
strong
and
the
soldiers
who
were
in
it
were
such
chosen
men
and
so
used
to
warfare
they
killed
many
of
the
king
people
yet
not
for
that
did
they
cease
fighting
but
every
day
and
at
every
attack
they
became
bolder
in
consequence
of
their
greed
for
what
the
captains
gave
them
for
the
money
had
the
power
of
taking
from
them
the
terror
of
death
which
had
inspired
them
before
they
also
gave
them
something
for
dragging
away
a
dead
man
from
the
foot
of
the
wall
so
the
fight
dragged
on
for
a
space
of
three
months
till
the
ydallcao
came
up
with
reinforcements
now
i
wish
you
to
know
more
of
the
situation
and
of
the
city
and
the
people
which
it
held
this
city
of
rachol
lies
between
two
great
rivers
and
in
the
midst
of
a
great
plain
where
there
are
no
trees
except
very
small
ones
and
there
are
great
boulders
there
from
each
river
to
the
city
is
three
leagues
one
of
these
rivers
is
the
northern
boundary
and
beyond
it
the
country
belongs
to
the
ydallcao
and
the
other
is
the
boundary
to
the
south
which
is
the
boundary
of
narsymga
this
plain
lies
in
the
middle
of
these
two
rivers
and
there
are
large
lakes
therein
and
wells
and
some
little
streams
where
the
city
is
situated
and
a
hill
which
looks
like
a
woman
breast
and
is
of
natural
formation
the
city
has
three
lines
of
strong
walls
of
heavy
masonry
made
without
lime
the
walls
are
packed
with
earth
inside
and
it
has
on
the
highest
point
a
fortress
like
a
tower
very
high
and
strong
at
the
top
where
the
fortress
stands
is
a
spring
of
water
which
runs
all
the
year
round
it
is
held
to
be
a
holy
and
mysterious
thing
that
a
spring
which
is
in
a
lofty
situation
should
in
some
way
never
be
without
water
besides
this
spring
there
are
several
tanks
of
water
and
wells
so
that
the
citizens
had
no
fear
of
being
ever
taken
for
lack
of
water
and
there
were
in
the
city
supplies
for
five
years
there
were
eight
thousand
men
as
garrison
and
four
hundred
horse
and
twenty
elephants
and
thirty
catapults
trabucos
which
hurled
heavy
stones
and
did
great
damage
the
towers
which
are
on
the
walls
are
so
close
together
that
one
can
hear
words
spoken
from
one
to
the
other
between
these
and
all
around
they
posted
their
artillery
which
consisted
of
two
hundred
heavy
pieces
not
to
mention
small
ones
as
soon
as
the
people
of
the
city
knew
of
the
arrival
of
the
king
troops
and
after
they
had
received
a
captain
of
the
ydallcao
who
came
with
some
soldiers
to
the
city
they
closed
the
gates
with
stone
and
mortar
the
chief
fight
which
takes
place
is
on
the
east
side
because
on
the
north
and
south
sides
it
stands
on
huge
rocks
which
make
it
very
strong
and
the
city
being
besieged
on
all
sides
the
camp
of
the
king
was
on
the
east
side
and
so
was
the
strength
of
the
attack
chapter
of
the
manner
in
which
the
king
had
his
camp
the
tent
of
the
king
was
surrounded
by
a
great
hedge
of
thorns
with
only
one
entrance
and
with
a
gate
at
which
stood
his
guards
inside
this
hedge
lodged
the
brahman
who
washes
him
and
has
charge
of
the
idol
that
he
always
carries
about
with
him
and
also
other
persons
who
hold
offices
about
the
king
person
and
eunuchs
who
are
always
to
be
found
in
his
chamber
and
outside
this
circle
all
around
are
his
guards
who
watch
all
night
at
fixed
spots
with
this
guard
are
quartered
the
officers
of
the
household
and
from
thence
to
the
front
were
all
the
other
captains
in
their
appointed
posts
according
as
each
one
was
entrusted
and
ordered
outside
of
all
these
people
in
a
camp
by
themselves
were
the
scouts
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
whose
duty
it
is
to
patrol
all
night
through
the
camp
and
watch
to
see
if
they
can
catch
any
spies
on
the
other
side
the
washermen
who
are
those
that
wash
clothes
were
in
a
camp
by
themselves
and
they
were
near
to
the
place
where
they
could
best
wash
clothes
all
the
camp
was
divided
into
regular
streets
each
captain
division
has
its
market
where
you
found
all
kinds
of
meat
such
as
sheep
goats
pigs
fowls
hares
partridges
and
other
birds
and
this
in
great
abundance
so
much
so
that
it
would
seem
as
if
you
were
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
and
you
found
many
endless
kinds
of
rice
grains
vetches
minguo
and
other
seeds
that
they
eat
besides
these
things
which
are
necessaries
they
had
another
market
where
you
could
find
in
great
abundance
everything
that
you
wanted
for
in
these
markets
they
sell
things
that
in
our
parts
are
sold
by
professional
hucksters
there
were
craftsmen
also
working
in
their
streets
so
that
you
saw
made
there
golden
jewels
and
gewgaws
and
you
will
find
all
kinds
of
rubies
and
diamonds
and
pearls
with
every
other
kind
of
precious
stone
for
sale
there
also
were
to
be
seen
sellers
of
cloths
and
these
were
without
number
as
that
is
a
thing
so
many
want
they
being
of
cotton
there
were
also
to
be
seen
grass
and
straw
in
infinite
abundance
i
do
not
know
who
could
describe
it
so
as
to
be
believed
so
barren
a
country
is
this
rachol
and
so
sandy
it
is
a
mystery
how
there
should
be
an
abundance
of
everything
therein
any
one
can
imagine
what
grass
and
straw
would
be
required
each
day
for
the
consumption
of
thousand
four
hundred
horses
and
five
hundred
and
elephants
to
say
nothing
of
the
and
asses
and
the
great
numbers
of
oxen
which
carry
all
the
supplies
and
many
other
burdens
such
as
tents
and
other
things
indeed
no
one
who
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
he
saw
would
ever
dream
that
a
war
was
going
on
but
would
think
that
he
was
in
a
prosperous
city
then
to
see
the
numbers
of
drums
and
trumpets
and
other
musical
instruments
that
they
use
when
they
strike
up
their
music
as
sign
that
they
are
about
to
give
battle
it
would
seem
as
if
the
heavens
must
fall
and
if
it
happened
that
a
bird
came
flying
along
at
the
time
when
they
made
such
a
terrific
noise
it
used
to
come
down
through
terror
of
not
being
able
to
get
clear
of
the
camp
and
so
they
would
catch
it
in
their
hands
principally
kites
of
which
they
caught
many
but
i
cease
to
speak
more
of
this
because
i
should
never
finish
and
so
i
turn
to
tell
of
the
battle
chapter
how
the
king
attacked
the
city
of
rachol
the
king
being
as
i
have
said
at
the
siege
of
the
city
of
rachol
there
came
to
him
sure
news
that
the
ydallcao
had
arrived
at
the
river
on
the
northern
side
and
that
there
he
had
pitched
his
camp
the
king
therefore
sent
his
spies
to
keep
watch
over
the
foe
to
see
what
he
was
doing
and
to
send
word
of
his
every
movement
with
the
coming
of
this
news
a
tumult
broke
out
in
the
camp
principally
among
the
common
soldiers
in
whose
minds
suspicion
was
never
wanting
and
they
still
suffered
under
the
terror
inspired
from
old
time
by
the
moors
there
the
ydallcao
halted
some
days
so
as
to
see
what
the
king
was
doing
and
whether
he
would
march
to
attack
him
there
in
his
camp
for
it
was
thought
by
him
and
by
his
people
that
as
soon
as
the
king
should
learn
of
his
arrival
he
would
at
once
march
to
meet
him
and
they
decided
that
he
could
defend
himself
from
the
king
in
the
place
where
he
was
better
than
in
any
other
by
help
of
the
river
for
there
was
no
other
ford
than
the
one
close
at
hand
and
this
they
proposed
to
guard
so
well
that
none
should
take
it
least
of
all
they
thought
men
who
in
their
eyes
were
only
blacks
although
the
king
heard
that
the
enemy
was
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
he
yet
made
no
move
nor
did
he
do
anything
and
the
ydallcao
seeing
that
he
made
no
advance
took
counsel
with
his
officers
and
at
this
council
the
advice
given
greatly
differed
as
each
had
his
own
opinion
regarding
the
of
the
king
many
said
that
this
was
because
the
king
held
his
foe
to
be
of
little
account
and
wished
to
show
his
people
how
great
was
his
power
and
they
said
that
he
was
only
waiting
for
them
to
cross
the
river
to
at
once
fall
upon
them
the
principal
person
who
said
this
was
amcostam
who
was
captain
of
pomdaa
at
the
time
that
dom
guterre
was
captain
of
goa
others
said
no
but
that
the
king
was
afraid
thinking
of
times
past
and
the
many
conquests
that
the
moors
had
gained
over
the
hindus
and
that
he
had
brought
with
him
some
veteran
soldiers
that
had
taken
part
in
those
wars
the
advice
of
these
was
to
push
forward
and
pass
the
river
it
was
not
well
they
said
for
the
ydallcao
to
show
weakness
and
the
longer
he
stayed
where
he
was
the
less
would
he
benefit
himself
and
harm
the
enemy
and
although
they
were
not
so
many
in
number
as
the
hindus
yet
they
had
the
advantage
in
the
remembrance
of
the
former
battles
that
had
been
fought
between
them
in
the
end
the
ydallcao
ordered
that
they
should
muster
the
forces
and
said
that
after
this
was
ended
he
would
decide
what
was
best
to
be
done
when
the
muster
was
made
he
found
that
he
had
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
on
foot
archers
and
musqueteers
and
men
with
shields
and
spearmen
and
eighteen
thousand
cavalry
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
elephants
and
when
the
muster
was
over
and
he
had
seen
his
forces
for
himself
seeing
also
the
great
strength
of
artillery
that
he
had
he
said
that
with
his
artillery
he
would
seek
to
defeat
the
rao
of
narsymga
he
therefore
ordered
them
to
make
ready
since
he
desired
to
cross
the
river
at
once
and
advance
to
the
attack
for
the
ydallcao
believed
that
his
best
course
was
to
halt
on
the
farther
side
and
thence
send
his
troops
to
charge
the
camp
of
the
king
and
that
in
so
doing
he
would
not
be
beaten
and
would
not
lose
rachol
in
this
greedy
resolve
he
passed
the
ford
and
advanced
to
within
three
leagues
of
the
king
camp
and
he
caused
his
own
camp
to
be
strengthened
by
large
trenches
and
commanded
all
his
artillery
to
take
post
in
front
and
he
arranged
the
order
of
his
positions
and
the
manner
in
which
they
should
behave
if
they
were
attacked
by
the
enemy
his
camp
extended
along
the
length
of
the
river
for
the
sake
of
the
water
that
he
might
not
be
cut
off
from
it
by
the
enemy
as
soon
as
they
brought
news
to
the
king
that
the
ydallcao
had
passed
the
river
he
commanded
all
to
make
ready
but
that
no
movement
should
take
place
in
his
army
till
he
should
see
how
the
enemy
acted
and
when
they
brought
him
further
news
that
the
enemy
had
pitched
his
camp
and
strengthened
his
position
he
ordered
a
general
advance
of
all
his
forces
he
divided
his
army
into
seven
wings
comarberya
begged
from
him
the
command
of
the
van
he
being
the
king
and
a
great
lord
he
is
king
of
serigapatao
and
lord
of
a
large
state
he
brought
with
him
thirty
sons
the
king
bade
him
pitch
his
camp
a
league
from
the
ydallcao
and
ordered
all
to
arm
themselves
at
dawn
as
he
intended
then
to
give
battle
to
the
enemy
but
the
men
of
the
council
said
that
that
day
was
an
unlucky
day
and
begged
him
not
to
attack
as
it
was
a
friday
and
they
asked
him
not
to
attack
till
saturday
which
they
hold
for
a
lucky
day
when
the
king
had
left
rachol
those
inside
opened
a
gate
and
one
of
the
captains
who
was
inside
a
eunuch
made
a
sally
with
two
hundred
horse
certain
and
elephants
he
kept
entirely
along
the
on
the
king
flank
the
object
of
this
no
one
could
guess
each
one
having
his
own
opinion
as
soon
as
the
king
halted
he
also
did
the
same
keeping
always
his
spies
in
the
king
camp
to
see
what
passed
and
what
would
be
the
end
of
the
battle
since
both
armies
were
so
close
each
to
his
foe
they
never
put
aside
their
weapons
but
watched
all
the
night
through
seeing
that
the
dawn
of
saturday
was
now
breaking
the
drums
and
trumpets
and
other
music
in
the
king
camp
began
to
sound
and
the
men
to
shout
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
sky
would
fall
to
the
earth
then
the
neighing
and
excitement
of
the
horses
and
the
trumpeting
of
the
elephants
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
describe
how
it
was
but
even
if
told
in
simple
truth
it
would
hardly
be
believed
the
great
fear
and
terror
that
struck
those
who
heard
it
so
that
even
those
very
men
that
caused
the
noise
were
themselves
frightened
at
it
and
the
enemy
on
their
part
made
no
less
noise
so
that
if
you
asked
anything
you
could
not
hear
yourself
speak
and
you
had
to
ask
by
signs
since
in
no
other
manner
could
you
make
yourself
understood
when
all
in
the
camp
had
gone
to
the
front
it
was
already
two
hours
after
sunrise
and
the
king
ordered
an
advance
of
his
two
forward
divisions
with
command
so
to
strike
home
that
they
should
leave
not
one
of
the
enemy
alive
and
this
was
forthwith
done
they
attacked
the
enemy
so
hotly
that
many
of
the
king
troops
found
themselves
on
the
tops
of
the
trenches
that
the
moors
had
constructed
in
the
fields
the
moors
were
disposed
as
if
they
expected
that
the
king
would
engage
them
all
at
once
with
all
his
forces
and
so
it
appeared
to
the
ydallcao
and
to
his
officers
and
for
that
reason
he
held
ready
all
his
artillery
waiting
for
the
time
when
owing
to
the
adventurousness
of
their
main
body
his
men
must
of
necessity
cause
much
slaughter
in
their
ranks
then
he
intended
to
bring
up
his
artillery
and
destroy
them
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
manner
of
their
attack
the
ydallcao
had
to
abandon
the
plan
that
had
seemed
to
him
best
for
their
safety
and
he
commended
the
whole
of
the
artillery
at
once
to
open
fire
which
discharge
as
it
was
very
great
did
much
damage
to
the
enemy
killing
many
of
the
horse
and
foot
and
many
elephants
and
it
compelled
the
troops
to
retire
as
soon
as
the
moors
saw
their
enemies
beginning
to
leave
the
field
they
charged
all
amongst
them
so
that
there
did
not
remain
one
man
in
the
saddle
nor
one
who
kept
his
face
to
the
foe
but
all
the
king
troops
began
to
fly
and
the
moors
after
them
slaughtering
them
for
about
half
a
league
when
the
king
saw
the
way
in
which
his
troops
fled
he
began
to
cry
out
that
they
were
traitors
and
that
he
would
see
who
was
his
side
and
that
since
they
all
had
to
die
they
should
meet
their
fate
boldly
according
to
custom
who
ranges
himself
with
me
he
cried
immediately
there
thronged
about
him
all
those
lords
and
captains
that
were
ready
to
side
with
him
and
the
king
said
that
the
day
had
arrived
in
which
the
ydallcao
would
boast
that
he
had
slain
in
it
the
greatest
lord
in
the
world
but
that
he
should
never
boast
that
he
had
vanquished
him
then
he
took
a
ring
from
his
finger
and
gave
it
to
one
of
his
pages
so
that
he
might
show
it
to
his
queens
in
token
of
his
death
that
they
might
burn
themselves
according
to
custom
then
he
mounted
a
horse
and
moved
forward
with
all
his
commanding
to
slay
without
mercy
every
man
of
those
who
had
fled
as
soon
as
these
last
saw
what
a
reception
they
received
at
the
hand
of
their
fellows
they
felt
compelled
to
turn
and
charge
the
enemy
and
their
attack
was
such
that
not
one
amongst
the
moors
was
found
to
face
them
for
the
moors
met
them
as
men
engaged
in
a
pursuit
all
in
great
disorder
the
confusion
was
so
great
amongst
the
moors
and
such
havoc
was
wrought
in
their
ranks
that
they
did
not
even
try
to
defend
the
camp
they
had
made
so
strong
and
enclosed
so
well
but
like
lost
men
they
leaped
into
the
river
to
save
themselves
then
after
them
came
large
numbers
of
the
king
troops
and
elephants
which
latter
worked
amongst
them
mischief
without
end
for
they
seized
men
with
their
trunks
and
tore
them
into
small
pieces
whilst
those
who
rode
in
the
castles
howdahs
killed
countless
numbers
the
troops
advanced
thus
pursuing
the
foe
till
the
king
reached
the
river
where
seeing
the
death
of
so
many
for
here
you
would
see
women
and
boys
who
had
left
the
camp
there
horses
and
men
who
through
clinging
one
to
another
could
not
escape
as
there
was
so
much
water
in
the
river
and
the
king
troops
stood
on
the
bank
so
that
whenever
a
man
appeared
he
was
killed
and
the
horses
that
tried
to
clamber
up
by
the
bank
of
the
river
unable
to
do
so
fell
back
on
the
men
so
that
neither
one
nor
the
other
escaped
and
the
elephants
went
into
the
stream
and
those
that
they
could
seize
were
cruelly
killed
by
them
seeing
what
passed
i
say
the
king
out
of
compassion
commanded
the
troops
to
retire
saying
that
numbers
had
died
who
did
not
deserve
death
nor
were
at
all
in
fault
which
order
was
at
once
obeyed
by
all
the
captains
so
that
each
one
withdrew
all
his
forces
the
king
then
advanced
to
the
camp
of
the
ydallcao
and
rested
himself
in
his
tent
but
many
of
the
captains
spoke
against
his
action
in
thus
taking
repose
saying
that
he
ought
rather
to
complete
the
destruction
of
all
his
enemies
and
they
would
secure
this
for
him
and
that
if
he
did
not
wish
himself
to
do
this
he
should
at
least
command
some
of
them
to
do
it
and
that
it
was
not
wise
to
cease
from
pursuit
so
long
as
daylight
should
last
to
whom
the
king
answered
that
many
had
died
who
were
not
to
blame
that
if
the
ydallcao
had
done
him
wrong
he
had
already
suffered
enough
and
moreover
that
it
did
not
seem
to
him
good
since
rachol
remained
behind
them
to
be
taken
that
they
should
go
forward
but
rather
they
should
make
themselves
ready
for
its
capture
for
that
the
siege
had
to
be
conducted
henceforth
in
a
new
and
better
manner
for
the
king
was
persuaded
throughout
that
since
the
ydallcao
had
lost
so
many
men
and
so
much
honour
and
had
lost
indeed
all
his
power
he
would
not
wish
to
live
any
longer
and
that
he
must
be
dead
on
the
field
which
however
was
not
so
seeing
that
the
ydallcao
had
not
even
entered
into
the
fight
but
had
all
the
time
remained
under
guard
of
sefallarym
he
who
now
calls
himself
acadacao
and
is
lord
of
belgaum
who
fearing
the
event
contrived
by
cunning
that
the
ydallcao
should
select
him
for
his
guard
with
all
his
troops
among
whom
he
had
four
hundred
cavalry
and
when
he
saw
how
the
soldiers
fled
and
how
completely
they
had
been
defeated
he
said
to
the
ydallcao
sire
if
thou
seekest
to
live
follow
me
and
the
ydallcao
took
refuge
on
an
elephant
and
followed
him
leaving
his
camp
and
all
that
he
possessed
and
as
acadacao
wished
him
to
travel
by
land
he
took
no
care
to
search
for
the
ford
but
skirting
the
range
of
hills
on
the
south
he
went
by
that
way
as
it
may
be
asked
what
became
of
the
captain
who
sallied
out
of
rachol
with
the
two
hundred
horsemen
and
elephants
and
i
say
that
he
ever
kept
himself
advised
of
what
passed
in
the
field
and
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
ydallcao
was
defeated
he
turned
back
to
take
refuge
again
in
the
citadel
but
those
within
were
not
of
a
mind
to
receive
him
there
being
a
quarrel
between
him
and
another
captain
who
was
in
the
city
and
he
seeing
that
they
would
not
admit
him
was
forced
to
think
how
he
could
save
himself
and
he
did
so
by
passing
the
river
by
another
ford
farther
down
and
so
saved
himself
the
belief
of
many
was
that
he
who
was
inside
thought
that
he
would
now
possess
the
city
for
his
own
and
that
he
would
thereby
become
rich
and
for
that
reason
refused
to
receive
the
captain
chapter
of
the
spoil
taken
from
the
moors
of
how
the
king
burned
all
the
dead
and
of
what
christovao
de
figueiredo
did
the
king
being
thus
in
the
camp
he
commanded
the
spoil
that
remained
of
the
moors
to
be
collected
and
there
were
found
five
captains
who
were
taken
prisoners
those
of
highest
rank
were
found
amongst
the
dead
the
chiefest
of
them
was
salabatacao
who
was
of
all
the
troops
of
the
ydallcao
he
had
taken
for
his
guard
in
the
battle
five
hundred
portuguese
of
the
renegades
who
were
with
the
moors
and
as
soon
as
this
salabatacao
saw
that
his
army
was
defeated
he
strove
to
collect
and
form
a
body
of
men
but
could
not
do
it
because
there
was
not
one
amongst
them
who
thought
of
aught
but
to
save
himself
and
thinking
it
worse
to
be
conquered
than
to
die
he
threw
himself
amongst
the
king
troops
slaughtering
them
and
doing
such
wonderful
deeds
that
ever
after
he
and
his
portuguese
were
remembered
so
much
were
their
terrible
strokes
feared
and
the
deeds
they
did
so
that
they
let
them
pass
on
and
they
penetrated
so
far
amongst
the
troops
that
they
found
themselves
close
to
the
king
bodyguard
there
the
horse
of
salabatacao
was
killed
in
order
to
succour
him
the
portuguese
did
great
deeds
and
killed
so
many
men
that
they
left
a
broad
road
behind
them
which
no
one
dared
to
enter
and
they
fought
so
well
that
they
got
another
horse
for
salabatacao
as
soon
as
he
was
on
its
back
he
seemed
like
nothing
but
a
furious
wolf
amongst
sheep
but
since
already
they
were
all
so
exhausted
so
wounded
all
over
and
so
encircled
by
the
enemy
for
they
were
attacked
at
every
point
salabatacao
was
at
length
overthrown
and
his
horse
with
him
and
as
the
portuguese
who
tried
to
succour
him
were
all
killed
not
one
escaping
and
he
himself
was
wounded
in
many
places
he
was
taken
prisoner
the
spoil
was
four
thousand
horses
of
ormuz
and
a
hundred
elephants
and
four
hundred
heavy
cannon
besides
small
ones
the
number
of
for
them
was
nine
hundred
and
there
were
many
tents
and
pavilions
i
take
no
account
of
the
and
oxen
and
other
beasts
for
they
were
numberless
nor
of
the
numbers
of
men
and
boys
nor
yet
of
some
women
whom
the
king
ordered
to
be
released
here
the
king
stayed
till
all
the
dead
had
been
burned
and
the
customary
honours
had
been
paid
to
them
and
here
he
gave
much
alms
for
the
souls
of
those
who
had
been
killed
in
battle
on
his
side
these
numbered
sixteen
thousand
and
odd
these
things
done
he
turned
again
upon
rachol
and
pitched
his
camp
as
he
had
done
before
during
this
return
of
the
king
there
came
to
meet
him
christovao
de
figueiredo
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
with
horses
and
he
took
with
him
twenty
portuguese
musqueteers
he
also
himself
having
his
musquet
the
king
took
much
pleasure
in
his
company
glad
that
he
should
see
the
war
and
his
great
power
and
he
ordered
some
tents
to
be
given
to
him
of
those
taken
from
the
ydallcao
and
commanded
that
he
should
be
lodged
close
to
his
own
quarters
one
day
christovao
de
figueiredo
told
the
king
that
he
wanted
to
go
and
see
the
city
but
the
king
said
that
he
should
not
set
his
heart
upon
that
because
he
did
not
want
any
disaster
to
befall
him
but
christovao
de
figueiredo
replied
that
the
whole
business
of
the
portuguese
was
war
and
that
this
would
be
the
greatest
favour
that
he
could
do
him
namely
that
his
highness
should
permit
him
to
go
and
see
the
moors
so
the
king
gave
him
leave
and
sent
some
people
with
him
christovao
de
figueiredo
went
close
to
the
trench
before
the
walls
keeping
himself
as
much
concealed
as
possible
and
seeing
how
fearlessly
the
moors
exposed
themselves
on
the
wall
began
with
the
musqueteers
whom
he
had
brought
to
open
fire
on
them
in
such
a
way
that
he
slew
many
the
moors
being
careless
and
free
from
fear
as
men
who
up
to
then
had
never
seen
men
killed
with
firearms
nor
with
other
such
weapons
so
they
began
to
forsake
the
wall
at
this
point
and
the
king
troops
found
an
opportunity
of
coming
in
safety
to
it
and
they
began
to
destroy
much
of
the
masonry
and
so
many
people
collected
on
this
side
that
all
the
camp
was
put
in
commotion
saying
that
christovao
de
figueiredo
had
entered
the
city
with
his
portuguese
this
was
told
to
the
king
those
in
the
city
could
not
understand
what
was
going
on
nor
how
these
people
came
to
be
in
the
king
service
until
they
recollected
how
on
the
day
of
the
other
fight
the
portuguese
had
come
and
then
they
considered
themselves
lost
for
by
the
aid
of
those
men
the
king
people
came
without
fear
to
the
wall
where
already
it
was
damaged
in
many
places
because
the
city
had
its
cannon
so
high
up
that
these
could
do
no
injury
to
the
men
who
were
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
the
wall
also
was
filled
up
inside
with
earth
and
there
were
no
cannon
in
the
breaches
the
people
of
the
city
whom
up
to
that
time
they
had
killed
had
been
supplied
with
stones
which
they
had
flung
on
the
besiegers
from
the
top
of
the
wall
and
with
musquets
and
arrows
so
that
even
if
the
king
men
were
able
to
reach
the
wall
at
all
they
were
at
least
wounded
but
as
christovao
de
figueiredo
with
the
portuguese
prevented
the
enemy
from
appearing
at
all
on
the
wall
the
hindus
were
enabled
to
reach
it
at
their
ease
here
you
would
have
seen
how
the
king
captains
begged
christovao
de
figueiredo
to
permit
them
one
day
to
attack
the
moors
in
his
company
and
he
in
order
to
content
the
more
honourable
of
them
went
with
them
on
those
days
one
day
he
divided
his
musqueteers
into
three
companies
and
began
to
kill
several
amongst
the
moors
who
showed
themselves
insomuch
that
none
durst
be
seen
and
then
the
king
troops
began
in
these
three
divisions
to
attack
the
wall
with
many
pickaxes
and
crowbars
and
he
sent
to
tell
the
rest
that
they
should
attack
on
their
own
account
and
such
was
the
result
that
the
defenders
of
the
city
began
to
abandon
the
first
line
of
fortification
and
the
women
and
children
took
refuge
in
the
citadel
the
captain
of
the
city
seeing
the
dismay
that
had
spread
amongst
his
people
began
to
turn
them
back
with
encouraging
words
and
with
some
of
them
betook
himself
to
that
part
of
the
wall
which
he
saw
was
most
severely
pressed
begging
them
that
they
would
come
back
to
the
wall
and
not
be
afraid
he
was
answered
by
some
that
at
that
point
were
those
franks
who
were
helping
and
that
as
soon
as
any
one
showed
himself
he
was
a
dead
man
and
he
wishing
to
see
for
himself
where
the
portuguese
were
reached
over
with
his
body
in
front
one
of
the
embrasures
and
was
killed
with
a
that
struck
him
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
it
was
said
by
the
moors
that
christovao
de
figueyredo
had
killed
him
and
they
took
notice
of
him
derao
sygnaes
d
elle
as
soon
as
the
captain
was
thus
killed
there
was
great
lamentation
in
the
city
and
soon
the
wall
was
deserted
so
that
the
men
from
the
king
camp
were
left
to
do
as
they
pleased
with
it
and
they
noticed
the
outcry
that
arose
within
and
saw
that
there
was
no
one
defending
the
wall
they
therefore
retired
to
see
what
should
happen
and
left
off
fighting
for
that
day
chapter
how
those
in
the
city
asked
for
terms
and
the
king
granted
them
quarter
next
day
which
was
twenty
days
since
the
battle
had
taken
place
in
which
the
ydallcao
had
been
defeated
the
men
of
the
city
opened
a
gate
and
with
a
white
flag
carried
in
front
of
them
went
the
way
of
the
king
camp
with
their
hands
uplifted
begging
the
king
mercy
when
the
king
was
advised
of
their
coming
he
commanded
solestema
his
minister
to
receive
them
and
when
they
saw
that
he
came
out
to
receive
them
they
began
to
hope
that
they
should
experience
kindness
at
the
king
hands
thus
they
came
to
the
place
where
he
was
and
there
they
prostrated
themselves
on
the
ground
with
much
groaning
and
tears
and
besought
his
pity
and
benevolence
the
king
commanded
them
to
rise
saying
that
he
would
save
all
their
persons
and
property
and
that
they
need
have
no
fear
but
should
return
to
the
city
and
that
on
the
next
day
he
would
enter
it
and
he
bade
a
captain
take
possession
of
the
city
whilst
the
moors
were
thus
in
presence
of
the
king
the
soldiers
looking
on
they
saw
christovao
de
figueiredo
and
told
the
king
that
the
conquest
and
capture
of
the
city
was
due
to
that
foreigner
that
he
had
slain
their
captain
and
with
his
people
had
killed
many
moors
which
caused
the
city
destruction
the
king
casting
his
eyes
on
christovao
de
figueiredo
nodded
his
head
and
turned
to
the
people
telling
them
to
observe
what
great
things
could
be
effected
by
one
good
man
he
then
retired
to
his
tent
and
the
men
of
the
city
to
the
city
and
the
king
troops
made
great
feasting
and
rejoicing
chapter
how
the
king
entered
the
city
and
of
the
feast
that
was
made
for
him
and
of
the
regulations
and
arrangements
he
made
there
as
soon
as
the
next
day
dawned
the
king
after
he
had
performed
both
his
customary
prayers
and
others
which
it
is
their
wont
to
offer
after
victories
giving
thanks
to
god
for
indeed
the
principal
thing
they
pray
for
is
a
conquest
such
as
this
rode
in
company
with
the
other
great
lords
and
his
captains
and
with
his
guard
took
the
way
to
the
city
there
the
citizens
were
standing
awaiting
his
arrival
with
more
cheerful
countenances
than
their
real
feelings
warranted
yet
striving
to
take
courage
and
they
followed
him
with
much
loud
shouting
crying
god
be
praised
who
has
sent
to
save
us
after
so
many
years
and
with
these
and
other
such
words
they
begged
him
to
spare
them
and
have
pity
on
them
so
he
proceeded
till
he
arrived
close
to
the
citadel
when
he
sent
to
call
the
most
honoured
men
in
the
city
and
to
these
the
king
said
that
he
would
spare
all
their
property
that
they
might
freely
act
as
they
wished
regarding
both
that
and
their
persons
and
those
who
wished
to
stay
in
the
city
might
remain
in
their
old
state
as
before
and
as
for
those
who
wished
to
depart
they
might
do
so
at
once
with
all
that
they
possessed
they
all
raised
their
hands
to
heaven
and
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
in
thankfulness
for
such
gentle
treatment
while
the
king
was
thus
engaged
there
came
men
to
tell
him
that
his
troops
were
robbing
the
city
and
he
at
once
tool
measures
to
prevent
this
and
everything
was
returned
to
its
owner
but
as
in
such
cases
as
these
the
conquered
are
content
merely
with
their
own
liberty
laying
little
store
by
anything
they
may
get
back
great
robberies
took
place
and
some
of
these
afterwards
came
to
the
ears
of
the
king
and
those
who
had
done
it
were
soundly
chastised
in
a
short
time
the
defeat
of
the
ydallcao
was
known
all
over
india
and
also
in
other
regions
of
the
interior
he
being
a
great
lord
in
these
parts
and
as
soon
as
the
news
was
carried
to
zemelluco
and
madremalluco
and
destuy
and
virido
and
also
to
other
lords
who
were
like
slaves
to
the
king
daquym
although
in
some
measure
they
rejoiced
since
they
wished
him
ill
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
began
to
be
fearful
for
their
own
safety
so
they
all
took
measures
to
send
their
envoys
and
these
found
the
king
still
inside
the
city
of
rachol
astonished
though
they
were
to
see
that
the
king
had
captured
so
strong
a
city
they
were
much
more
surprised
to
see
how
great
was
his
power
and
how
numerous
his
troops
having
arrived
where
he
was
they
gave
him
the
letters
they
had
brought
and
these
were
forthwith
read
in
these
the
chiefs
told
the
king
that
he
ought
to
content
himself
with
having
defeated
the
ydallcao
as
he
had
done
and
ought
not
to
wage
further
war
they
begged
him
of
his
goodness
to
return
to
the
ydallcao
that
which
he
had
so
taken
from
him
and
that
if
he
did
so
they
would
always
obey
whatever
he
commanded
but
if
he
was
not
of
a
mind
to
this
then
he
must
know
for
certain
that
they
would
be
compelled
to
turn
against
him
and
forthwith
join
the
ydallcao
for
whom
they
would
speedily
recover
that
which
he
had
now
lost
the
king
seeing
what
was
contained
in
the
letters
answered
them
in
the
following
manner
by
one
single
letter
to
them
all
honoured
madremalluco
and
zemelluco
descar
and
veride
and
all
others
of
the
kingdom
of
daquym
i
have
seen
your
letters
and
thank
you
much
for
what
you
have
sent
to
say
as
regards
the
ydallcao
what
i
have
done
to
him
and
taken
from
him
he
has
richly
deserved
as
regards
returning
it
to
him
that
does
not
seem
to
me
reasonable
nor
am
i
going
to
do
it
and
as
for
your
further
statement
that
ye
will
all
turn
against
me
in
aid
of
him
if
i
do
not
do
as
ye
ask
i
pray
you
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
come
hither
for
i
will
myself
go
to
seek
ye
if
ye
dare
to
await
me
in
your
lands
and
this
i
send
you
for
answer
and
he
commanded
to
give
many
gifts
to
the
messengers
and
giving
his
letter
to
them
sent
them
away
chapter
how
a
number
of
people
left
the
city
and
the
king
did
much
kindness
to
them
many
people
left
the
city
and
to
many
who
had
nothing
wherewith
to
depart
the
king
commanded
to
give
all
that
was
required
for
their
journey
here
the
king
stayed
some
days
after
having
made
all
the
arrangements
that
were
necessary
for
the
government
of
the
city
and
after
repairing
the
walls
he
left
behind
him
sufficient
troops
to
guard
the
place
and
took
the
road
to
the
city
of
bisnaga
where
he
was
received
with
great
triumphs
and
great
feasts
were
made
and
he
bestowed
bountiful
rewards
on
his
troops
as
soon
as
the
festivals
were
ended
he
went
to
the
new
city
and
being
there
they
told
him
how
there
was
entered
an
ambassador
of
the
ydallcao
already
he
knew
that
an
ambassador
had
come
but
he
pretended
that
he
did
not
know
since
it
is
not
customary
for
the
king
to
send
out
to
receive
any
ambassador
on
his
arrival
since
this
ambassador
was
in
the
city
of
bisnaga
knowing
that
the
king
was
in
the
new
city
which
is
two
leagues
from
bisnaga
he
betook
himself
thither
and
close
to
the
city
bade
the
people
pitch
his
tent
which
was
the
best
and
most
beautiful
and
rich
that
up
to
that
time
had
ever
been
seen
in
those
parts
this
ambassador
was
called
matucotam
he
brought
with
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
horse
and
much
people
to
serve
him
and
many
pack
animals
among
which
were
certain
camels
he
brought
also
two
of
the
scribes
of
the
chamber
of
the
ydallcao
so
that
indeed
you
would
believe
that
he
had
brought
all
the
power
of
the
ydallcao
pera
segumdo
elle
ficou
desbaratado
as
soon
as
he
had
thus
settled
himself
the
ambassador
sent
to
inform
the
king
of
his
arrival
and
begged
that
his
highness
would
grant
him
an
audience
and
despatch
him
without
delay
the
king
replied
that
he
would
see
him
but
told
him
that
he
should
not
be
impatient
since
he
himself
had
but
now
arrived
and
that
he
would
give
him
leave
to
depart
as
soon
as
the
time
had
arrived
and
with
this
the
ambassador
stayed
there
a
month
without
the
king
having
sought
to
see
him
nor
having
asked
to
know
why
he
had
come
he
went
every
day
to
the
palace
and
seeing
the
way
in
which
the
king
acted
towards
him
he
determined
to
speak
no
more
but
to
wait
till
the
king
summoned
him
still
he
never
ceased
to
go
every
day
to
the
palace
and
to
speak
with
the
nobles
one
day
the
king
sent
to
tell
the
ambassador
that
the
following
day
was
an
auspicious
day
and
that
he
wished
to
hear
him
and
learn
wherefore
he
had
come
and
the
ambassador
made
ready
as
it
behoved
him
to
present
himself
before
so
great
a
lord
as
was
fitting
considering
his
mission
and
the
request
he
had
to
make
he
was
accompanied
by
many
moors
whom
the
city
contained
and
had
with
him
all
his
people
with
their
trumpets
and
drums
as
was
customary
and
so
he
went
to
the
palace
where
he
was
received
very
honourably
by
the
nobles
and
officers
of
the
household
they
seated
themselves
inside
the
first
gate
awaiting
there
a
message
from
the
king
giving
permission
to
enter
where
he
was
and
there
was
no
long
delay
before
the
command
to
admit
him
was
given
his
obeisance
to
the
king
having
been
made
according
to
his
mode
and
custom
the
men
of
the
council
standing
by
the
king
side
he
was
bidden
to
announce
the
terms
of
his
embassy
the
king
being
ready
graciously
to
listen
and
the
ambassador
seeing
that
the
king
so
commanded
delivered
himself
of
his
message
in
manner
following
with
the
awed
demeanour
assumed
by
such
envoys
when
they
find
themselves
in
presence
of
such
great
kings

he
begs
thee
that
thou
wouldest
be
pleased
to
do
justice
he
bids
me
say
that
he
bears
very
good
will
towards
thee
as
towards
the
most
true
and
powerful
prince
in
all
the
world
and
one
possessed
of
most
justice
and
truth
that
thou
without
reason
hast
broken
the
friendship
and
peace
which
thou
hast
had
towards
him
and
not
only
so
but
a
peace
which
was
made
so
many
years
ago
and
maintained
by
all
the
kings
so
truthfully
that
he
does
not
know
why
thou
hast
left
thy
kingdom
and
made
such
war
on
him
that
he
was
without
suspicion
when
they
brought
him
the
news
how
thou
hadst
besieged
the
city
of
rachol
and
hadst
robbed
and
destroyed
the
country
round
about
which
news
caused
him
to
move
and
come
to
its
rescue
that
then
all
the
members
of
his
court
were
slain
by
thee
and
his
camp
all
plundered
and
destroyed
thou
thyself
being
good
witness
of
what
was
done
and
that
he
begs
thee
to
make
amends
therefor
and
to
send
back
to
him
his
artillery
and
tents
his
horses
and
elephants
with
the
rest
that
was
taken
from
him
and
also
to
restore
his
city
of
rachol
that
if
thou
wilt
give
him
the
satisfaction
for
which
he
prays
as
to
this
property
and
all
other
things
thou
wilt
have
him
always
for
a
loyal
friend
but
if
not
thy
action
will
be
evil
even
though
pleasing
to
thyself
thus
he
ended
without
saying
more
the
king
said
that
he
might
retire
and
repose
and
that
next
day
he
would
give
him
leave
to
depart
and
the
king
gave
him
a
robe
of
silk
and
the
cloths
that
are
customary
chapter
how
the
king
sent
to
call
the
ambassador
and
of
the
answer
which
he
gave
to
him
next
day
the
king
sent
to
call
the
ambassador
and
after
other
things
had
been
spoken
of
between
them
the
king
said
that
he
would
be
content
to
restore
everything
to
the
ydallcao
according
to
his
wish
and
would
be
pleased
at
once
to
release
satabetacao
provided
the
ydallcao
would
come
and
kiss
his
foot
when
the
ambassador
heard
the
king
answer
he
took
leave
of
him
and
went
to
his
tent
and
he
wrote
to
the
ydallcao
and
told
him
what
had
passed
sending
to
him
one
of
the
scribes
that
had
come
with
him
and
much
time
had
not
passed
when
the
ydallcao
sent
him
a
reply
saying
how
could
it
be
possible
for
him
to
meet
the
king
seeing
that
he
could
not
go
to
bisnaga
and
yet
that
he
was
of
full
mind
joyfully
to
do
that
which
the
king
wished
with
this
answer
the
ambassador
went
to
the
king
and
since
the
king
would
have
set
higher
value
on
the
ydallcao
coming
to
kiss
his
feet
than
on
all
that
he
had
taken
from
him
he
said
to
the
ambassador
do
thou
cause
the
ydallcao
to
come
to
the
confines
of
my
kingdom
for
i
shall
be
soon
there
agreeing
to
this
the
ambassador
departed
so
as
to
persuade
the
ydallcao
to
come
to
the
boundary
the
king
on
his
part
went
forthwith
to
a
city
called
mudugal
which
is
close
to
the
boundary
and
there
he
waited
until
they
told
him
that
the
ydallcao
was
coming
and
was
already
near
at
hand
forthwith
the
king
set
out
to
meet
him
and
entered
the
kingdom
of
daquem
so
desirous
was
he
to
meet
the
ydallcao
but
the
ydallcao
after
all
dared
not
meet
the
king
and
the
king
journeyed
so
far
whilst
they
kept
saying
to
him
lo
he
is
here
close
at
hand
that
he
even
went
as
far
as
bizapor
which
is
the
best
city
in
all
the
kingdom
of
daquem
it
has
numbers
of
beautiful
houses
built
according
to
our
own
fashion
with
many
gardens
and
bowers
made
of
and
pomegranates
and
oranges
and
lemons
and
all
other
kinds
of
garden
produce
hither
went
the
king
for
it
seemed
well
for
him
to
await
the
coming
of
the
ydallcao
in
so
goodly
a
city
and
he
formed
the
determination
that
if
he
got
him
here
he
would
seize
him
or
command
him
to
be
put
to
death
to
avenge
the
affront
that
had
been
put
upon
him
and
seeing
that
his
enemy
did
not
dare
to
come
he
remained
in
the
city
several
days
then
he
turned
away
because
water
failed
him
for
since
this
city
lies
in
a
plain
and
has
no
water
save
that
which
it
receives
from
rainfall
into
two
lakes
of
which
there
are
two
large
ones
the
moors
had
opened
these
in
order
to
drain
them
so
that
the
king
should
not
be
able
to
stay
in
their
country
for
this
reason
it
behoved
the
king
to
depart
but
the
city
was
left
almost
in
ruins
not
that
the
king
had
commanded
it
to
be
destroyed
but
that
his
troops
in
order
to
make
fires
for
cooking
had
torn
down
so
many
houses
that
it
was
a
great
grief
to
see
and
this
was
occasioned
by
there
being
in
the
country
a
dearth
of
firewood
which
comes
to
them
from
a
great
distance
the
ydallcao
sent
to
ask
the
king
what
wrong
the
houses
of
his
captains
had
done
that
he
had
commanded
to
destroy
them
for
there
remained
no
other
houses
standing
save
only
the
palaces
of
the
ydallcao
the
king
himself
being
therein
the
king
sent
answer
that
it
was
not
he
who
had
done
it
but
that
he
could
not
control
his
people
when
the
king
went
to
the
town
of
modogal
the
ydallcao
returned
to
bigapor
where
seeing
the
great
havoc
that
had
been
wrought
in
it
he
took
to
himself
the
blame
for
such
damage
having
been
done
saying
that
if
he
had
gone
to
the
king
such
destruction
would
not
have
taken
place
and
that
at
least
he
could
do
this
in
future
he
said
that
he
had
been
badly
advised
since
for
his
own
part
he
had
been
prepared
to
do
it
thus
he
took
counsel
with
his
advisers
putting
before
them
how
secure
his
position
was
if
he
had
the
friendship
of
the
king
that
if
allied
to
him
he
might
be
able
to
still
further
increase
the
greatness
of
his
state
and
that
with
the
king
favour
he
would
be
able
to
carry
out
all
his
wishes
concerning
these
things
and
others
similar
to
these
he
continued
constantly
speaking
with
his
advisers
wherefore
acadacao
the
lord
of
bilgao
he
who
had
fled
with
him
in
the
battle
and
who
was
a
man
sagacious
and
cunning
in
such
matters
addressed
the
ydallcao
begging
permission
to
go
himself
to
the
king
and
saying
that
he
would
remedy
everything
and
would
cause
everything
to
take
place
just
as
his
lord
wished
and
the
ydallcao
listened
to
him
readily
now
acadacao
did
not
trouble
himself
to
make
this
journey
because
he
desired
to
serve
the
ydallcao
for
another
would
have
done
it
as
well
but
he
did
it
with
a
villainous
motive
and
from
the
he
bore
to
salebatacao
whom
the
king
held
in
prison
at
bisnaga
and
the
reason
that
he
had
this
wicked
motive
was
because
salebatacao
knew
that
acadacao
was
the
man
that
had
caused
the
ydallcao
to
flee
and
that
the
cowardice
of
such
an
act
was
enough
to
destroy
an
army
salebatacao
had
spoken
angrily
about
this
to
all
those
who
went
to
see
him
or
who
were
sent
to
visit
him
and
he
always
said
that
he
did
not
desire
to
be
released
from
his
captivity
save
for
one
reason
only
namely
that
he
might
ruin
acadacao
and
war
against
him
as
against
a
mortal
enemy
these
things
were
all
known
to
acadacao
and
he
knew
that
if
they
released
him
it
would
come
to
pass
as
he
had
said
and
therefore
he
determined
to
prevent
this
by
contriving
his
death
as
will
be
mentioned
in
its
place
it
was
for
this
reason
that
acadacao
asked
to
be
sent
as
ambassador
to
the
king
and
this
was
done
chapter
how
acadacao
went
as
ambassador
for
his
king
and
compassed
the
death
of
sallabatecao
acadacao
being
despatched
by
the
ydallcao
accompanied
by
certain
horsemen
with
some
servants
took
the
road
to
the
city
of
mudogal
where
the
king
was
and
the
ydallcao
went
with
him
as
far
as
the
river
when
acadacao
had
arrived
being
allowed
inside
the
city
by
command
of
the
king
he
remained
several
days
without
seeing
the
king
until
he
was
summoned
by
his
order
then
he
was
admitted
and
spoke
with
the
king
giving
him
with
the
manner
of
one
who
in
such
negotiations
is
both
wise
and
bold
an
excuse
for
the
mistake
which
the
ydallcao
had
committed
he
knew
how
to
speak
to
the
king
so
well
that
he
removed
all
the
king
wrath
and
fury
against
the
ydallcao
and
he
told
the
king
that
the
principal
cause
why
the
ydallcao
did
not
meet
him
was
the
conduct
of
salebatacao
whom
he
had
captured
and
that
this
man
had
written
to
the
ydallcao
telling
him
not
to
do
so
and
giving
for
reason
that
the
king
desired
to
slay
him
by
these
and
other
similar
sayings
he
sought
to
set
the
king
mind
against
salebatacao
even
to
the
death
and
the
king
seeing
what
acadacao
wanted
and
believing
that
a
man
of
such
great
fame
would
not
be
guilty
of
saying
anything
that
was
not
perfectly
true
angrily
commanded
that
salebatacao
who
was
then
in
bisnaga
should
be
beheaded
and
this
was
at
once
done
as
soon
as
the
message
arrived
as
soon
as
acadacao
had
accomplished
this
business
he
thought
himself
unsafe
and
at
once
asked
leave
of
the
king
saying
that
he
wished
to
go
and
get
the
ydallcao
to
come
to
the
river
so
that
when
his
highness
arrived
he
might
meet
him
there
but
the
king
told
him
not
to
be
impatient
but
to
amuse
himself
there
some
days
and
added
that
he
wished
to
show
him
some
things
and
that
he
had
somewhat
about
which
to
speak
to
him
acadacao
however
being
afraid
that
his
treason
would
be
discovered
did
not
feel
safe
and
behaved
in
such
a
manner
that
what
he
had
done
concerning
salebatacao
was
found
out
wherefore
the
king
sent
to
seize
him
but
when
they
went
to
look
for
him
he
was
already
gone
for
he
fled
one
night
and
betook
himself
to
the
ydalcao
telling
him
that
the
king
had
commanded
salebatacao
to
be
put
to
death
and
that
he
wanted
to
do
the
same
to
him
and
so
he
had
escaped
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
the
ydalcao
ought
not
to
trust
the
king
who
after
all
was
nothing
but
a
black
after
he
had
spoken
in
this
way
he
went
to
bilgao
where
he
strengthened
his
position
and
when
the
ydallcao
sent
afterwards
to
summon
him
he
never
obeyed
because
he
knew
that
the
wickedness
that
he
had
done
had
been
found
out
chapter
how
the
king
went
to
the
extremity
of
his
territory
to
meet
the
ydalcao
and
what
he
did
on
not
finding
him
the
king
did
not
fail
to
go
to
the
extremity
of
his
territory
and
since
he
did
not
find
the
ydalcao
there
nor
his
mother
as
acadacao
had
told
him
he
at
once
perceived
that
this
was
due
to
trickery
on
the
part
of
acadacao
and
that
he
had
done
it
all
in
order
to
compass
the
death
of
salebatacao
full
of
fury
at
this
he
entered
the
kingdom
of
daquem
and
marched
against
the
city
of
culbergura
and
destroyed
it
and
razed
the
fortress
to
the
ground
and
the
same
with
many
other
places
thence
he
wanted
to
press
forward
but
his
councillors
did
not
agree
to
this
saying
that
water
would
fail
him
by
that
road
and
that
it
did
not
seem
to
them
that
those
moorish
lords
whom
they
counted
as
friends
would
be
otherwise
than
afraid
that
the
king
would
take
their
lands
as
he
had
taken
those
of
the
others
since
they
all
served
one
sovereign
and
that
for
this
reason
these
lords
would
probably
make
friends
with
the
ydalcao
and
together
they
would
come
against
the
king
and
although
there
was
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
them
yet
the
king
must
needs
fear
the
want
of
water
of
which
they
had
none
and
the
king
agreed
that
this
counsel
was
good
in
this
city
of
calbergara
in
the
fortress
belonging
to
it
the
king
took
three
sons
of
the
king
of
daquem
he
made
the
eldest
king
of
the
kingdom
of
daquem
his
father
being
dead
though
the
ydallcao
wanted
to
make
king
one
of
his
who
was
a
bastard
son
of
the
king
of
daquem
and
had
married
one
of
the
ydallcao
sisters
for
this
reason
he
had
kept
these
three
brothers
prisoners
in
that
fortress
he
whom
he
thus
made
king
was
received
by
all
the
realm
as
such
and
obeyed
by
all
the
great
lords
and
even
by
the
ydallcao
owing
to
his
fear
of
the
king
the
other
two
brothers
he
took
with
him
and
gave
them
each
one
an
allowance
to
each
one
every
year
fifty
thousand
gold
pardaos
and
he
holds
them
and
treats
them
as
princes
and
great
lords
as
indeed
they
are
after
the
return
of
the
king
to
bisnaga
which
took
place
in
the
same
year
in
which
he
had
left
nothing
more
passed
between
him
and
the
ydalcao
worthy
of
record
relating
either
to
peace
or
war
chapter
how
this
king
during
his
own
lifetime
raised
to
be
king
his
son
being
of
the
age
of
six
years
after
the
king
had
made
an
end
of
this
and
had
obtained
so
great
a
victory
over
his
enemies
perceiving
that
he
was
already
advanced
in
years
desiring
to
rest
in
his
old
age
and
wishing
his
son
to
become
king
when
he
died
he
determined
to
make
him
king
during
his
lifetime
the
boy
being
six
years
old
and
the
king
not
knowing
what
would
happen
after
his
death
wherefore
he
abdicated
his
throne
and
all
his
power
and
name
and
gave
it
all
to
his
son
and
himself
became
his
minister
and
salvatinica
who
had
held
that
office
became
his
counsellor
and
he
made
one
of
the
latter
sons
a
great
lord
among
them
and
so
far
did
king
crisnarao
go
that
after
he
had
given
the
kingdom
to
his
son
he
himself
did
obeisance
to
him
with
these
changes
the
king
made
great
festivals
which
lasted
eight
months
during
which
time
the
son
of
the
king
fell
sick
of
a
disease
of
which
he
died
after
his
death
crisnarao
learned
that
his
son
had
died
by
poison
given
him
by
the
son
of
sallvatinica
and
in
his
anger
being
certain
that
this
was
so
he
sent
to
call
salvatinica
and
his
son
and
guandaja
brother
of
ssallvatinica
and
many
other
captains
relatives
of
ssallvatinica
and
made
them
a
speech
at
the
time
of
the
salaam
there
being
present
many
chiefs
and
principal
persons
of
the
kingdom
and
relations
of
ssallvatinica
he
addressed
him
thus
i
held
thee
always
as
my
great
friend
and
now
for
these
forty
years
thou
hast
been
governor
in
this
kingdom
which
thou
gavest
me
yet
i
am
under
no
obligation
to
thee
for
that
because
in
doing
so
thou
didst
act
in
a
way
contrary
to
thy
duty
thou
wert
bound
since
thy
lord
the
king
my
brother
commanded
so
to
put
out
mine
eyes
yet
thou
didst
not
carry
out
his
will
nor
obey
him
but
instead
thou
didst
cheat
him
and
the
eyes
of
a
goat
were
put
out
wherefore
since
thou
didst
not
fulfil
his
command
thou
wert
a
traitor
and
thy
sons
with
thee
for
whom
i
have
done
so
much
now
i
have
learnt
that
my
son
died
of
poison
given
to
him
by
thee
and
thy
sons
and
for
that
ye
are
all
here
made
prisoners
with
these
words
he
arose
and
laid
hands
on
them
and
seized
them
and
in
doing
so
called
for
aid
from
many
portuguese
who
were
then
in
the
country
with
horses
asking
them
to
come
to
his
aid
and
after
he
had
seized
the
men
father
and
sons
they
remained
three
years
in
prison
and
he
made
minister
a
son
of
codemerade
the
same
who
had
killed
the
son
of
king
narsymga
in
the
city
of
penagundy
in
the
garden
by
treachery
by
command
of
the
king
his
father
as
has
already
been
told
in
this
history
and
soon
afterwards
danayque
son
of
salvatinica
escaped
from
prison
and
betook
himself
to
a
mountain
range
in
which
dwelt
nobody
but
robbers
and
highwaymen
and
in
this
there
was
a
fortress
where
dwelt
a
captain
his
relative
who
received
him
and
helped
him
in
all
that
he
could
and
from
there
he
made
such
war
on
the
king
crisnarao
that
he
was
driven
to
send
against
him
much
people
and
as
captain
of
the
army
he
sent
his
minister
ajaboissa
who
invested
the
place
on
all
sides
and
took
him
therein
and
brought
him
prisoner
to
the
king
after
he
had
so
come
the
king
commanded
him
to
be
brought
before
him
with
sallvatinica
his
father
and
another
brother
of
his
who
was
kept
in
the
prison
and
he
sent
them
to
the
place
of
executions
and
there
had
their
eyes
put
out
for
in
this
country
they
do
not
put
brahmans
to
death
but
only
inflict
some
punishment
so
that
they
remain
alive
so
he
put
them
in
prison
again
and
there
timadanayque
died
and
salvatinica
his
father
remained
in
the
prison
with
his
other
son

chapter
how
the
ydallcao
came
against
rachol
and
did
not
dare
to
await
the
king
and
fled
at
this
time
the
ydallcao
collected
his
army
and
formed
afresh
his
forces
of
cavalry
and
elephants
and
marched
upon
rachol
which
remained
under
the
king
of
bisnaga
hearing
this
news
crisnarao
without
even
telling
any
one
ordered
to
saddle
a
horse
and
he
rode
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
rachol
where
already
the
ydallcao
was
but
as
soon
as
his
enemy
was
aware
of
the
coming
of
the
king
he
fled
on
the
road
king
crisnarao
bought
six
hundred
horses
from
the
portuguese
at
the
rate
of
for
pardaos
and
from
rachol
he
sent
a
message
to
the
ydallcao
saying
that
he
had
already
twice
broken
his
oath
and
his
word
and
that
as
he
had
not
fulfilled
the
promise
he
had
made
he
would
make
war
on
him
in
such
fashion
as
that
by
force
he
should
become
his
vassal
and
that
he
would
not
let
him
alone
till
he
had
taken
from
him
billgao
as
the
winter
had
now
begun
the
king
could
not
then
go
forward
and
so
he
went
to
bisnaga
to
make
ready
for
this
war
and
he
commanded
to
prepare
a
large
force
of
artillery
and
sent
an
ambassador
to
goa
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
governor
he
promised
him
that
after
taking
billgao
he
would
give
him
the
mainland
for
this
city
of
billgao
is
fifteen
leagues
from
goa
and
its
captain
is
lord
of
the
mainland
of
goa
goa
is
the
frontier
or
boundary
of
his
city
of
billgao
and
there
is
one
of
his
captains
at
a
fortress
called
pomda
which
is
three
leagues
from
goa
by
the
mainland
who
also
receives
the
revenues
and
has
command
over
several
villages
and
in
like
manner
these
and
others
have
captains
appointed
by
the
ydalcao
who
is
lord
of
the
whole
land
while
crisnarao
was
thus
making
ready
he
presently
fell
sick
of
the
same
illness
of
which
all
his
ancestors
had
died
with
pains
in
the
groin
of
which
die
all
the
kings
of
bisnaga
now
this
king
crisnarao
when
he
was
young
and
growing
up
in
this
city
of
bisnaga
had
an
intrigue
with
a
courtezan
for
whom
he
had
much
affection
and
who
was
called
chinadevidy
and
for
the
great
love
he
bore
her
he
promised
many
times
that
if
ever
he
became
king
he
would
marry
her
and
though
he
said
this
in
jest
it
afterwards
became
true
so
the
history
records
for
when
raised
to
the
throne
and
taken
away
from
the
things
he
had
done
when
a
young
man
he
still
did
not
forget
the
affection
he
felt
for
this
woman
but
used
secretly
to
leave
his
palace
and
go
to
her
house
and
this
was
discovered
one
night
by
his
minister
sallvatinica
who
watched
him
until
he
had
got
into
the
woman
house
and
he
rebuked
him
much
for
it
and
brought
him
back
to
the
palace
then
the
king
told
him
how
well
he
loved
her
and
that
he
had
promised
to
marry
this
woman
and
was
determined
to
do
so
in
any
case
and
the
minister
seeing
how
he
was
bent
on
it
gave
way
to
his
wish
saying
that
he
would
accomplish
it
in
such
a
way
that
his
highness
would
not
be
blamed
for
it
in
order
to
do
this
he
sought
for
him
a
very
beautiful
woman
of
the
family
of
the
kings
of
narsymga
and
after
he
had
married
him
to
her
at
the
end
of
the
wedding
ceremonies
he
put
this
woman
and
the
other
in
a
house
to
which
he
had
added
a
tower
very
lofty
and
large
and
in
which
he
lodged
her
afterwards
the
king
married
many
other
wives
for
these
kings
hold
it
as
a
very
honourable
thing
to
have
many
wives
and
this
king
crisnarao
married
four
and
yet
he
loved
this
one
better
than
any
of
the
others
this
king
built
a
city
in
honour
of
this
woman
for
the
love
he
bore
her
and
called
its
name
nagallapor
and
surrounded
it
with
a
new
wall
which
is
one
of
the
best
works
that
he
has
in
his
kingdom
and
he
made
in
it
a
street
very
long
and
large
with
houses
all
of
masonry
in
order
to
people
this
town
he
ordered
all
the
chiefs
of
his
kingdom
to
build
themselves
palaces
therein
and
so
they
did
this
town
has
one
principal
street
of
length
four
thousand
and
seven
hundred
paces
and
of
breadth
forty
which
is
certainly
the
most
beautiful
street
it
is
possible
to
see
and
he
made
and
finished
this
town
without
stinting
any
expense
on
it
it
now
yields
thousand
pardaos
of
duties
for
things
which
enter
into
it
the
duties
in
this
land
being
very
great
since
nothing
comes
through
the
gates
that
does
not
pay
duty
even
men
and
women
as
well
as
and
all
merchandise
this
king
also
made
in
his
time
a
lake
for
water
which
lies
between
two
very
lofty
serras
but
since
he
had
no
means
in
the
country
for
making
it
nor
any
one
who
could
do
it
he
sent
to
goa
to
ask
the
governor
to
send
some
portuguese
masons
and
the
governor
sent
him
joao
della
ponte
a
great
worker
in
stone
to
whom
the
king
told
how
he
wanted
the
tank
built
though
it
seemed
to
this
man
mestre
modern
maistry
impossible
to
be
made
nevertheless
he
told
the
king
he
would
do
it
and
asked
him
to
have
lime
prepared
at
which
the
king
laughed
much
for
in
his
country
when
they
build
a
house
they
do
not
understand
how
to
use
lime
the
king
commanded
to
throw
down
quantities
of
stone
and
cast
down
many
great
rocks
into
the
valley
but
everything
fell
to
pieces
so
that
all
the
work
done
in
the
day
was
destroyed
each
night
and
the
king
amazed
at
this
sent
to
call
his
wise
men
and
sorcerers
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
of
this
thing
they
told
him
that
his
idols
were
not
pleased
with
this
work
it
being
so
great
and
he
giving
them
nothing
and
that
unless
he
spilled
there
the
blood
of
men
or
women
or
buffaloes
that
work
would
never
be
finished
so
the
king
sent
to
bring
hither
all
the
men
who
were
his
prisoners
and
who
deserved
death
and
ordered
them
there
to
be
beheaded
and
with
this
the
work
advanced
he
made
a
bank
across
the
middle
of
the
valley
so
lofty
and
wide
that
it
was
a
in
breadth
and
length
and
had
large
openings
and
below
it
he
put
pipes
by
which
the
water
escaped
and
when
they
wish
so
to
do
they
close
these
by
means
of
this
water
they
made
many
improvements
in
the
city
and
many
channels
by
which
they
irrigated
and
gardens
and
in
order
that
they
might
improve
their
lands
he
gave
the
people
the
lands
which
are
irrigated
by
this
water
free
for
nine
years
until
they
had
made
their
improvements
so
that
the
revenue
already
amounts
to
pardaos
above
this
tank
is
a
very
large
ridge
all
enclosed
and
in
the
middle
some
very
strong
gates
with
two
towers
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
and
within
are
always
posted
men
on
guard
for
through
this
gate
all
things
must
enter
that
come
into
the
two
cities
since
in
order
to
enter
the
city
of
bisnaga
there
is
no
other
road
but
this
all
other
roads
meeting
there
this
gate
is
rented
out
for
pardaos
each
year
and
no
man
can
enter
it
without
paying
just
what
the
renters
ask
country
folk
as
well
as
strangers
in
both
these
cities
there
is
no
provision
or
merchandise
whatever
for
all
comes
from
outside
on
since
in
this
country
they
always
use
beasts
for
burdens
and
every
day
there
enter
by
these
gates
oxen
and
every
one
of
these

chapter
how
on
the
death
of
crisnarao
his
brother
achetarao
was
raised
to
be
king
before
the
death
of
king
crisnarao
from
his
disease
as
has
been
before
recounted
being
sick
and
already
despairing
of
his
life
he
made
a
will
saying
that
of
his
three
brothers
whom
at
the
time
when
they
raised
him
to
be
king
he
had
sent
to
be
confined
in
the
fortress
of
chamdegary
with
his
nephew
son
of
the
king
busbalrao
they
should
make
king
his
brother
achetarao
who
now
reigns
for
the
latter
seemed
to
him
to
be
better
fitted
for
that
than
any
of
the
others
for
the
reason
that
he
himself
had
no
son
of
fit
age
for
the
throne
but
only
one
of
the
age
of
eighteen
months
after
his
death
salvanay
became
minister
of
the
kingdom
and
governed
it
till
the
coming
of
king
achitarao
from
the
fortress
of
chamdegary
where
he
was
detained
and
he
further
left
in
his
will
that
he
should
take
billgao
and
should
make
war
on
the
ydallcao
which
king
chytarao
after
he
ascended
the
throne
gave
himself
over
to
vice
and
tyranny
he
is
a
man
of
very
little
honesty
and
on
account
of
this
the
people
and
the
captains
are
much
discontented
with
his
evil
life
and
inclinations
for
he
has
never
done
anything
except
those
things
that
are
desired
by
his
two
who
are
men
very
evilly
disposed
and
great
jews
by
reason
of
this
the
ydalcao
learning
of
how
little
weight
he
was
determined
to
make
war
on
him
believing
that
he
would
easily
succeed
since
the
king
was
not
inclined
to
war
so
he
made
his
forces
ready
and
began
to
invade
the
territory
and
arrived
within
a
league
of
the
city
of
bisnaga
chetarao
was
in
the
city
with
such
great
forces
and
power
that
he
could
easily
have
captured
him
if
his
heart
had
allowed
him
to
take
action
since
the
ydallcao
had
with
him
only
foot
and
horse
yet
with
this
small
force
the
ydallcao
entered
nagallapor
a
league
from
bisnaga
and
razed
it
to
the
ground
the
king
never
tried
to
go
out
against
him
nor
had
he
the
stomach
for
a
fight
and
there
were
only
small
skirmishes
by
some
captains
good
horsemen
these
spoke
to
the
king
asking
that
his
highness
would
give
them
leave
to
attack
and
saying
that
his
own
presence
was
unnecessary
for
so
slight
an
affair
but
the
king
was
terrified
and
by
the
advice
of
his
of
which
they
gave
not
a
little
decided
to
send
and
make
peace
with
the
ydallcao
the
ydallcao
was
very
glad
and
made
a
peace
with
him
which
was
to
last
for
a
hundred
years
on
condition
that
the
king
should
give
him
ten
lakhs
of
gold
pardaos
each
lakh
being
pardaos
and
further
should
yield
up
to
him
the
city
of
rachol
which
the
king
crisnarao
had
taken
from
him
and
which
had
a
revenue
with
its
lands
of
pardaos
as
well
as
jewels
which
could
easily
be
valued
at
a
lakh
the
king
accepted
these
terms
and
the
ydallcao
departed
well
pleased
with
this
money
and
after
all
was
done
the
king
sent
to
him
a
diamond
stone
weighing
mangellinis
with
fifteen
other
similar
ones
worth
fully
a
lakh
this
money
he
soon
afterwards
recovered
and
put
in
his
treasury
exacting
payments
from
his
captains
and
people
so
ruthlessly
that
they
say
that
in
six
months
he
had
recovered
and
put
the
whole
in
his
treasury
wherefore
the
captains
and
troops
both
because
he
made
this
peace
and
because
he
exacted
this
sum
of
money
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
them
all
have
lived
greatly
discontented
and
have
held
that
if
this
kingdom
should
ever
be
brought
to
destruction
it
must
take
place
in
the
lifetime
of
king
chitarao
for
he
had
destroyed
the
principal
people
of
his
kingdom
and
killed
their
sons
and
taken
their
goods
all
owing
to
the
bad
counsel
of
his
by
whom
he
was
dominated
i
will
tell
you
of
one
who
was
called
crisnaranarque
whom
he
seized
one
night
and
who
before
he
surrendered
himself
killed
all
his
wives
in
number
two
hundred
and
then
killed
himself
with
poison
in
presence
of
the
king
this
was
because
the
king
wanted
to
kill
his
son
in
his
presence
by
sale
of
the
captain
arms
namely
daggers
swords
spears
and
other
things
which
were
all
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
the
king
realised
more
than
pardaos
in
this
way
the
kingdom
has
been
deprived
of
its
principal
men
and
of
those
who
sustain
it
wherefore
the
ydalcao
holds
it
in
so
little
esteem
that
he
puts
upon
it
every
day
a
thousand
affronts
and
requisitions
of
this
king
there
is
nothing
more
so
far
to
recount
save
that
he
is
a
man
that
they
hold
to
be
of
little
force
of
character
and
very
negligent
of
the
things
which
most
concern
the
welfare
of
his
kingdom

has
four
pillows
of
the
same
pattern
for
the
feet
and
has
no
other
sheet
than
a
silk
cloth
on
top
he
always
carries
with
him
a
mosquito
curtain
with
a
frame
of
silver
and
he
has
a
house
made
of
pieces
of
iron
in
which
is
contained
a
very
large
bed
which
is
intended
for
such
time
as
he
takes
the
field
he
has
five
hundred
wives
and
as
many
less
or
more
as
he
wants
with
whom
he
sleeps
and
all
of
these
burn
themselves
at
his
death
when
he
journeys
to
any
place
he
takes
or
thirty
of
his
most
favourite
wives
who
go
with
him
each
one
in
her
palanqueen
with
poles
the
palanqueen
of
the
principal
wife
is
an
covered
with
scarlet
cloth
tasselled
with
large
and
heavy
work
in
and
pearls
and
the
pole
itself
is
ornamented
with
gold
the
palanqueens
of
the
other
wives
are
ornamented
only
with
silver
but
another
palanqueen
which
is
for
his
own
person
always
goes
on
the
right
side
and
is
in
the
same
way
decorated
with
gold
for
a
son
or
a
daughter
if
such
an
one
goes
with
him
he
takes
another
bedstead
of
ivory
inlaid
with
gold
and
when
he
takes
the
field
wherever
he
pitches
his
camp
there
they
make
for
him
houses
of
stone
and
clay
for
he
does
not
stay
in
a
tent
and
he
always
has
these
decorated
with
cloths
in
his
palace
within
the
gates
he
is
served
by
women
and
eunuchs
and
servants
numbering
fully
five
or
six
hundred
and
these
wives
of
the
king
all
have
their
own
officials
for
their
service
each
for
herself
just
as
the
king
has
within
the
gates
but
these
are
all
women
the
palaces
of
the
king
are
large
and
with
large
rooms
they
have
cloisters
like
monasteries
with
cells
and
in
each
one
is
one
of
his
wives
and
with
each
of
these
ladies
is
her
and
when
the
king
retires
to
rest
he
passes
through
these
cloisters
and
his
wives
stand
at
the
doors
and
call
him
in
but
these
are
not
the
principal
wives
they
are
the
daughters
of
captains
and
nobles
of
the
country
inside
the
gates
of
the
palace
they
say
that
there
are
over
two
hundred
from
the
milk
of
which
they
make
butter
for
these
ladies
to
eat
the
king
has
no
expense
in
connection
with
his
food
because
the
nobles
send
it
to
him
every
day
to
his
house
namely
rice
and
wheat
and
meat
and
fowls
with
all

are
also
captains
of
soldiers
these
porters
do
not
go
further
inside
than
through
four
or
five
doors
because
inside
of
these
are
none
but
eunuchs
and
women
when
the
king
rides
out
there
go
with
him
usually
two
hundred
horsemen
of
his
guard
whom
he
pays
and
a
hundred
elephants
and
this
in

to
the
captains
forty

alcaid
with
about
thirty
horsemen
having
canes
in
their

a
great

carried
by
men
at
the
sides
and
they
go
now
and
then
striking
it

sound
of

is
heard
a
long
distance
off

they
open
to

your

makes
salaam
to
you
the
kings
of
bisnaga
have
always
liked
for
show
to
have
many
horses
in
their
stables
and
they
always
had
eight
or
nine
hundred
horses
and
four
or
five
hundred
elephants
on
account
of
which
and
on
account
of
the
people
that
looked
after
them
they
were
put
to
great
expense
and
this
king
that
now
is
achyuta

has
in
his
stable
seven
hundred
and
odd
horses
and
four
hundred
elephants
he
spends
on

of
them

he
gives

two
thousand
gold
pardaos

those
who

some

who
have
less
pay
receive
not
less
than
a
hundred
of
these
six
thousand
two
hundred
are
obliged
to
ride
with
the
king
the
kings
of
this
country
are
able
to
assemble
as
many
soldiers
as
they
want
as
they
have
them
there
in
their
kingdom
and
have
much
wealth
wherewith
to
pay
them
this
king
chitarao
has
paid
by
his
nobles
and
they
are
obliged
to
maintain
six
lakhs
of
soldiers
that
is
six
hundred
thousand
men
and
thousand
horse
which
the
same
nobles
are
obliged
to
have
these
nobles
are
like
renters
who
hold
all
the
land
from
the
king
and
besides
keeping
all
these
people
they
have
to
pay
their
cost
they
also
pay
to
him
every
year
sixty
lakhs
of
rents
as
royal
dues
the
lands
they
say
yield
a
hundred
and
twenty
lakhs
of
which
they
must
pay
sixty
to
the
king
and
the
rest
they
retain
for
the
pay
of
the
soldiers
and
the
expenses
of
the
elephants
which
they
are
obliged
to
maintain
for
this
reason
the
common
people
suffer
much
hardship
those
who
hold
the
lands
being
so
tyrannical
of
these
sixty
lakhs
that
the
king
has
of
revenue
every
year
he
does
not
enjoy
a
larger
sum
than
lakhs
for
the
rest
is
spent
on
his
horses
and
elephants
and
and
cavalry
whose
cost
he
defrays
during
his
feasts
and
the
almsgiving
to
his
temples
all
these
captains
who
are
thus
like
renters
must
always
attend
the
court
and
of
those
whom
this
king
always
has
about
him
and
by
whom
he
is
accompanied
in
his
court
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
these
are
obliged
always
to
be
present
with
the
king
and
must
always
maintain
the
full
number
of
soldiers
according
to
their
obligations
for
if
he
finds
that
they
have
a
less
number
they
are
severely
punished
and
their
estates
confiscated
these
nobles
are
never
suffered
to
settle
themselves
in
cities
or
towns
because
they
would
there
be
beyond
reach
of
his
hand
they
only
go
thither
sometimes
but
a
concession
is
granted
to
the
kings
that
are
subject
to
him
namely
they
do
not
go
to
court
unless
they
are
summoned
and
from
their
own
cities
they
send
to
him
their
rents
or
tributes
yet
the
king
of
bengapor
is
obliged
to
be
always
in
camp
and
he
goes
to
court
twice
in
the
year
the
kings
who
are
subject
are
these
besides
this
king
of
bengapor
namely
the
king
of
gasopa
and
the
king
of
bacanor
and
the
king
of
calecu
and
he
of
batecala
and
these
when
they
come
to
the
court
of
bisnaga
are
not
held
in
higher
esteem
than
any
other
captains
either
by
the
king
or
by
the
other
nobles
the
captains
and
lords
of
this
kingdom
of
bisnaga
as
well
those
who
are
at
court
as
those
who
are
away
from
it
have
each
one
his
secretary
who
goes
to
the
palace
in
order
to
write
to
him
and
let
him
know
what
the
king
is
doing
and
they
manage
so
that
nothing
takes
place
of
which
they
do
not
soon
know
and
day
and
night
they
are
always
in
the
palace
and
the
king
also
when
he
leaves
the
palace
takes
with
him
on
his
own
account
secretaries
who
write
what
the
king
says
and
the
favours
he
bestows
and
with
whom
he
spoke
and
upon
what
subject
and
what
his
determination
was
and
to
these
men
is
given
a
credit
equal
to
that
of
the
evangelists
because
they
say
that
whenever
the
king
speaks
there
must
be
something
worthy
to
be
recorded
and
also
that
such
a
record
is
necessary
for
their
remembrance
thus
no
written
orders
are
ever
issued
nor
any
charters
granted
for
the
favours
he
bestows
or
the
commands
he
gives
but
when
he
confers
a
favour
on
any
one
it
remains
written
in
the
registers
of
these
secretaries
the
king
however
gives
to
the
recipient
of
the
favour
a
seal
impressed
in
wax
from
one
of
his
rings
which
his
minister
keeps
and
these
seals
serve
for
letters
patent
these
kings
of
bisnaga
eat
all
sorts
of
things
but
not
the
flesh
of
oxen
or
cows
which
they
never
kill
in
all
the
country
of
the
heathen
because
they
worship
them
they
eat
mutton
pork
venison
partridges
hares
doves
quail
and
all
kinds
of
birds
even
sparrows
and
rats
and
cats
and
lizards
all
of
which
are
sold
in
the
market
of
the
city
of
bisnaga
everything
has
to
be
sold
alive
so
that
each
one
may
know
what
he
buys
this
at
least
so
far
as
concerns
game
and
there
are
fish
from
the
rivers
in
large
quantities
the
markets
are
always
overflowing
with
abundance
of
fruits
grapes
oranges
limes
pomegranates
and
mangoes
and
all
very
cheap
it
is
said
that
in
the
markets
they
give
twelve
live
sheep
for
a
pardao
and
in
the
hills
they
give
fourteen
or
fifteen
for
a
pardao
the
king
drinks
water
which
they
bring
from
a
spring
which
is
kept
enclosed
under
the
hand
of
a
man
in
whom
the
king
has
great
confidence
and
the
vessels
in
which
they
draw
the
water
come
covered
and
sealed
thus
they
deliver
it
to
the
women
who
wait
on
him
and
they
take
it
inside
to
the
other
women
the
king
wives
the
greatest
mark
of
honour
that
this
king
of
bisnaga
confers
on
a
noble
consists
of
two
fans
ornamented
with
gold
and
precious
stones
made
of
the
white
tails
of
certain
cows
he
gives
them
bracelets
also
everything
which
the
noble
receives
is
placed
on
the
ground
the
king
confers
very
high
honour
too
if
he
permits
a
certain
one
to
kiss
his
feet
for
he
never
gives
his
hands
to
be
kissed
by
any
one
when
he
wishes
to
please
his
captains
or
persons
from
whom
he
has
received
or
wishes
to
receive
good
service
he
gives
them
scarves
of
honour
for
their
personal
use
which
is
a
great
honour
and
this
he
does
each
year
to
the
captains
at
the
time
that
they
pay
him
their
this
takes
place
in
the
month
of
september
when
for
nine
days
they
make
great
feasts
some
say
that
they
do
this
in
honour
of
the
nine
months
during
which
our
lady
bore
her
son
in
the
womb
others
say
that
it
is
only
done
because
at
this
time
the
captains
come
to
pay
their
rents
to
the
king
which
feasts
are
conducted
in
the
following
manner
the
first
day
they
put
nine
castles
in
a
piece
of
ground
which
is
in
front
of
the
palace
which
castles
are
made
by
the
nine
principal
captains
in
the
kingdom
they
are
very
lofty
and
are
hung
with
rich
cloths
and
in
them
are
many
and
also
many
kinds
of
contrivances
besides
these
nine
every
captain
is
obliged
to
make
each
one
his
castle
and
they
come
to
show
these
to
the
king
each
one
has
his
separate
device
and
they
all
come
like
this
during
the
nine
days
of
the
feast
the
officers
of
the
city
are
bound
to
come
with
their
devices
each
day
at
night
just
as
in
our
festivals
and
in
these
nine
days
they
slaughter
animals
and
make
sacrifice
the
first
day
they
kill
nine
male
buffaloes
and
nine
sheep
and
nine
goats
and
thenceforward
they
kill
each
day
more
always
doubling
the
number
and
when
they
have
finished
slaying
these
beasts
there
come
nine
horses
and
nine
elephants
of
the
king
and
these
come
before
the
king
covered
with
flowers
roses
and
with
rich
trappings
before
them
goes
the
chief
master
of
the
horse
with
many
attendants
and
they
make
salaam
to
the
king
and
when
these
have
finished
making
their
salaam
there
come
from
within
priests
and
they
bring
rice
and
other
cooked
edibles
and
water
and
fire
and
many
kinds
of
scents
and
they
offer
prayers
and
throw
the
water
over
the
horses
and
elephants
just
as
our
priests
do
with
holy
water
and
they
put
chaplets
of
roses
on
them
this
is
done
in
the
presence
of
the
king
who
remains
seated
on
a
throne
of
gold
and
precious
stones
he
never
sits
on
this
except
only
this
once
in
the
year
and
this
king
that
now
reigns
does
not
sit
on
it
for
they
say
that
whoever
sits
on
it
must
be
a
very
truthful
man
one
who
speaks
the
whole
truth
and
this
king
never
does
so
whilst
this
is
going
on
there
pass
by
the
king
fully
a
thousand
women
dancing
and
posturing
before
him
after
all
the
devices
that
have
been
prepared
have
been
witnessed
all
the
horses
of
the
king
pass
by
covered
with
their
silken
trappings
and
with
much
adornment
of
gold
and
precious
stones
on
their
heads
and
then
all
the
elephants
and
yokes
of
oxen
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
in
front
of
the
palace
after
these
have
been
seen
there
come
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
king
wives
covered
with
gold
and
pearls
and
much
work
of
and
in
the
hands
of
each
a
vessel
of
gold
with
a
lamp
of
oil
burning
in
it
and
with
these
women
come
all
the
female
servants
and
the
other
wives
of
the
king
with
canes
in
their
hands
tipped
with
gold
and
with
torches
burning
and
these
then
retire
inside
with
the
king
these
women
are
so
richly
bedecked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
that
they
are
hardly
able
to
move
in
this
way
during
these
nine
days
they
are
compelled
to
search
for
all
things
which
will
give
pleasure
to
the
king
the
king
has
a
thousand
wrestlers
for
these
feasts
who
wrestle
before
the
king
but
not
in
our
manner
for
they
strike
and
wound
each
other
with
two
circlets
with
points
which
they
carry
in
their
hands
to
strike
with
and
the
one
most
wounded
goes
and
takes
his
reward
in
the
shape
of
a
silk
cloth
such
as
the
king
gives
to
these
wrestlers
they
have
a
captain
over
them
and
they
do
not
perform
any
other
service
in
the
kingdom
and
after
these
nine
days
are
finished
the
rao
rides
out
and
goes
to
hold
a
review
of
the
troops
of
his
captains
and
he
goes
a
length
of
two
leagues
between
the
armed
men
at
the
end
he
dismounts
and
takes
a
bow
in
his
hand
and
shoots
three
arrows
namely
one
for
the
ydallcao
and
another
for
the
king
of
cotamuloco
and
yet
another
for
the
portuguese
it
was
his
custom
to
make
war
on
the
kingdom
lying
in
the
direction
where
the
arrow
reached
furthest
after
this
is
done
the
king
returns
home
and
on
that
day
he
fasts
and
with
him
all
the
people
of
the
land
and
on
the
next
day
he
goes
to
the
river
to
bathe
with
all
his
people
within
these
nine
days
the
king
is
paid
all
the
rents
that
he
receives
from
his
kingdom
for
as
already
said
all
the
land
belongs
to
the
king
and
from
his
hand
the
captains
hold
it
they
make
it
over
to
the
husbandmen
who
pay
to
their
lord
and
they
have
no
land
of
their
own
for
the
kingdom
belongs
entirely
to
the
king
only
the
captains
are
put
to
charges
on
account
of
the
troops
for
whom
the
king
makes
them
responsible
and
whom
they
are
obliged
to
provide
in
the
way
of
service
every
saturday
the
are
obliged
to
go
to
the
palace
to
dance
and
posture
before
the
king
idol
which
is
in
the
interior
of
his
palace
the
people
of
this
country
always
fast
on
saturdays
and
do
not
eat
all
day
nor
even
at
night
nor
do
they
drink
water
only
they
may
chew
a
few
cloves
to
sweeten
the
breath
the
king
always
gives
large
sums
in
charity
in
the
palace
there
are
always
two
or
three
thousand
brahmans
who
are
his
priests
and
to
whom
the
king
commands
to
give
alms
these
brahman
priests
are
very
despicable
men
they
always
have
much
money
and
are
so
insolent
that
even
by
using
blows
the
guards
of
the
door
can
not
hold
them
in
check
the
captains
and
principal
people
use
at
night
torches
of
oil
from
four
to
twelve
torches
according
to
rank
those
of
highest
rank
having
twelve
at
most
the
king
however
must
have
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
torches
there
is
much
wax
in
the
country
but
they
do
not
know
how
to
work
it
every
merchant
who
brings
merchandise
in
horses
and
other
things
which
he
may
have
brought
to
sell
to
the
king
if
he
desires
an
audience
has
to
offer
him
a
present
of
a
piece
of
goods
or
a
horse
of
the
best
that
he
has
brought
in
order
that
he
may
obtain
an
audience
and
transact
his
business
and
this
not
only
to
the
king
you
must
perforce
pay
bribes
to
all
the
several
officers
with
whom
you
have
to
deal
they
will
do
nothing
without
some
profit
to
themselves
when
any
one
suffers
wrong
and
wishes
to
represent
his
case
to
the
king
he
shows
how
great
is
his
suffering
by
lying
flat
on
his
face
on
the
ground
till
they
ask
him
what
it
is
he
wants
if
perchance
he
wishes
to
speak
to
the
king
while
he
is
riding
he
takes
the
shaft
of
a
spear
and
ties
a
branch
to
it
and
thus
goes
along
calling
out
then
they
make
room
for
him
and
he
makes
his
complaint
to
the
king
and
it
is
there
and
then
settled
without
more
ado
and
the
king
orders
a
captain
one
of
those
who
go
with
him
to
do
at
once
what
the
supplicant
asks
if
he
complains
that
he
was
robbed
in
such
and
such
a
province
and
in
such
and
such
a
road
the
king
sends
immediately
for
the
captain
of
that
province
even
though
he
be
at
court
and
the
captain
may
be
seized
and
his
property
taken
if
he
does
not
catch
the
thief
in
the
same
way
the
chief
bailiff
is
obliged
to
give
an
account
of
the
robberies
in
the
capital
and
in
consequence
very
few
thefts
take
place
and
even
if
some
are
committed
you
give
some
little
present
and
a
description
of
the
man
who
stole
from
you
and
they
will
soon
know
by
the
agency
of
the
wizards
whether
the
thief
be
in
the
city
or
not
for
there
are
very
powerful
wizards
in
this
country
thus
there
are
very
few
thieves
in
the
land
this
king
has
continually
fifty
thousand
paid
soldiers
amongst
whom
are
six
thousand
horsemen
who
belong
to
the
palace
guard
to
which
six
thousand
belong
the
two
hundred
who
are
obliged
to
ride
with
him
he
has
also
twenty
thousand
spearmen
and
and
three
thousand
men
to
look
after
the
elephants
in
the
stables
he
has
sixteen
hundred
grooms
who
attend
to
the
horses
and
has
also
three
hundred
horse
trainers
and
two
thousand
artificers
namely
blacksmiths
masons
and
carpenters
and
washermen
who
wash
clothes
these
are
the
people
he
has
and
pays
every
day
he
gives
them
their
allowance
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
to
the
six
thousand
horsemen
the
king
gives
horses
free
and
gives
provision
for
them
every
month
and
all
these
horses
are
marked
with
the
king
mark
when
they
die
they
are
obliged
to
take
the
piece
of
skin
containing
the
mark
to
madanarque
the
chief
master
of
the
horse
so
that
he
may
give
them
another
and
these
horses
which
he
gives
are
mostly
which
the
king
buys
twelve
or
fifteen
for
a
thousand
pardaos
the
king
every
year
buys
thirteen
thousand
horses
of
ormuz
and
of
which
he
chooses
the
best
for
his
own
stables
and
he
gives
the
rest
to
his
captains
and
gains
much
money
by
them
because
after
taking
out
the
good
persian
horses
he
sells
those
which
are
and
gives
five
for
a
thousand
pardaos
and
they
are
obliged
to
pay
him
the
money
for
them
within
the
month
of
september
and
with
the
money
so
obtained
he
pays
for
the
arabs
that
he
buys
of
the
portuguese
in
such
a
way
that
his
captains
pay
the
cost
of
the
whole
without
anything
going
out
of
the
treasury
this
king
has
also
within
his
gates
more
than
four
thousand
women
all
of
whom
live
in
the
palace
some
are
and
others
are
bearers
who
carry
the
king
wives
on
their
shoulders
and
the
king
also
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
for
the
houses
are
large
and
there
are
great
intervals
between
one
house
and
another
he
has
also
women
who
wrestle
and
others
who
are
astrologers
and
soothsayers
and
he
has
women
who
write
all
the
accounts
of
expenses
that
are
incurred
inside
the
gates
and
others
whose
duty
it
is
to
write
all
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
and
compare
their
books
with
those
of
the
writers
outside
he
has
women
also
for
music
who
play
instruments
and
sing
even
the
wives
of
the
king
are
well
versed
in
music
the
king
has
other
women
besides
he
has
ten
cooks
for
his
personal
service
and
has
others
kept
for
times
when
he
gives
banquets
and
these
ten
prepare
the
food
for
no
one
save
for
the
king
alone
he
has
a
eunuch
for
guard
at
the
gate
of
the
kitchen
who
never
allows
any
one
to
enter
for
fear
of
poison
when
the
king
wishes
to
eat
every
person
withdraws
and
then
come
some
of
the
women
whose
duty
it
is
and
they
prepare
the
table
for
him
they
place
for
him
a
stool
round
made
of
gold
and
on
it
put
the
messes
these
are
brought
in
large
vessels
of
gold
and
the
smaller
messes
in
basins
of
gold
some
of
which
are
adorned
with
precious
stones
there
is
no
cloth
on
the
table
but
one
is
brought
when
the
king
has
finished
eating
and
he
washes
his
hands
and
mouth
women
and
eunuchs
serve
him
at
table
the
wives
of
the
king
remain
each
in
her
own
chamber
and
are
waited
on
by
it
is
said
that
he
has
judges
as
well
as
bailiffs
and
watchmen
who
every
night
guard
the
palace
and
all
these
are
women
the
king
never
puts
on
any
garment
more
than
once
and
when
he
takes
it
off
he
at
once
delivers
it
to
certain
officers
who
have
charge
of
this
duty
and
they
render
an
account
and
these
garments
are
never
given
to
any
one
this
is
considered
to
show
great
state
his
clothes
are
silk
cloths
pachoiis
of
very
fine
material
and
worked
with
gold
which
are
worth
each
one
ten
pardaos
and
they
wear
at
times
bajuris
of
the
same
sort
which
are
like
shirts
with
a
skirt
and
on
the
head
they
wear
caps
of
brocade
which
they
call
culaes
and
one
of
these
is
worth
some
twenty
cruzados
when
he
lifts
it
from
his
head
he
never
again
puts
it
on
the
punishments
that
they
inflict
in
this
kingdom
are
these
for
a
thief
whatever
theft
he
commits
howsoever
little
it
be
they
forthwith
cut
off
a
foot
and
a
hand
and
if
his
theft
be
a
great
one
he
is
hanged
with
a
hook
under
his
chin
if
a
man
outrages
a
respectable
woman
or
a
virgin
he
has
the
same
punishment
and
if
he
does
any
other
such
violence
his
punishment
is
of
a
like
kind
nobles
who
become
traitors
are
sent
to
be
impaled
alive
on
a
wooden
stake
thrust
through
the
belly
and
people
of
the
lower
orders
for
whatever
crime
they
commit
he
forthwith
commands
to
cut
off
their
heads
in
the
and
the
same
for
a
murder
unless
the
death
was
the
result
of
a
duel
for
great
honour
is
done
to
those
who
fight
in
a
duel
and
they
give
the
estate
of
the
dead
man
to
the
survivor
but
no
one
fights
a
duel
without
first
asking
leave
of
the
minister
who
forthwith
grants
it
these
are
the
common
kinds
of
punishments
but
they
have
others
more
fanciful
for
when
the
king
so
desires
he
commands
a
man
to
be
thrown
to
the
elephants
and
they
tear
him
in
pieces
the
people
are
so
subject
to
him
that
if
you
told
a
man
on
the
part
of
the
king
that
he
must
stand
still
in
a
street
holding
a
stone
on
his
back
all
day
till
you
released
him
he
would
do
it
the
officers
of
the
king
who
go
about
the
kingdom
are
these
first
the
minister
regedor
of
the
kingdom
who
is
the
second
person
in

then
the

his
house
but
only
the

of

that
he
only
gets
the
balance
after
deducting
the
expenses
of
this
force

in
this
way
he
acquires
much
wealth

the
kingdom

is
divided
between
more
than
two
hundred
captains
who
are
all
heathen
and
according
to
the
lands
and
revenues
that
they
have
so
the
king
settles
for
them
the
forces
that
they
are

to
keep
up

how
much
revenue
they
have
to
pay
him
every

first
nine

never

they
do
not
pay
they
are
well
punished
and
are
ruined
and
their
property
taken
away
all
the
captains
of
this
kingdom
make
use
of
litters
and
palanqueens
these
are
like
biers
and
men
carry
them
on
their
shoulders
but
people
are
not
allowed
to
make
use
of
litters
unless
they
are
cavaliers
of
the
highest
rank
and
the
captains
and
principal
persons
use
palanqueens
there
are
always
at
the
court
where
the
king
is
twenty
thousand
litters
and
palanqueens
these
matters
concerning
the
power
and
greatness
of
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
though
it
may
seem
to
you
that
i
have
exaggerated
yet
the
people
of
this
country
assert
them
to
have
been
even
more
notable
in
times
past
and
greater
than
they
now
are
and
in
this
kingdom
of
bisnaga
there
is
a
class
of
men
natives
of
the
country
namely
brahmans
who
the
most
part
of
them
never
kill
or
eat
any
live
thing
and
these
are
the
best
that
there
are
amongst
them
they
are
honest
men
given
to
merchandise
very
acute
and
of
much
talent
very
good
at
accounts
lean
men
and
but
little
fit
for
hard
work
by
these
and
by
the
duties
they
undertake
the
kingdom
is
carried
on
they
believe
that
there
are
three
persons
and
only
one
god
and
they
call
the
persons
of
the
most
holy
trinity
tricebemca
there
is
another
class
who
are
canarese
who
have
pagodas
in
which
are
images
of
monkeys
and
cows
and
buffaloes
and
devils
to
whom
they
pay
much
honour
and
these
idols
and
monkeys
which
they
adore
they
say
that
in
former
times
this
land
belonged
all
to
the
monkeys
and
that
in
those
days
they
could
speak
they
have
books
full
of
fine
stories
of
chivalry
and
many
foolish
tales
about
their
idols
such
as
it
is
out
of
reason
for
men
to
believe
but
because
of
this
neither
in
the
kingdom
of
bisnaga
nor
in
all
the
land
of
the
heathen
are
any
monkeys
killed
and
there
are
so
many
in
this
country
that
they
cover
the
mountains
there
is
another
class
of
men
called
telumgalle
when
these
die
their
wives
are
buried
alive
with
them
the
king
of
bisnaga
is
a
brahman
every
day
he
hears
the
preaching
of
a
learned
brahman
who
never
married
nor
ever
touched
a
woman
he
urges
in
his
preaching
obedience
to
the
commandments
of
god
that
is
to
say
that
one
must
not
kill
any
living
thing
nor
take
anything
belonging
to
another
and
as
with
these
so
with
the
rest
of
the
commandments
these
people
have
such
devotion
to
cows
that
they
kiss
them
every
day
some
they
say
even
on
the
rump
a
thing
i
do
not
assert
for
their
honour
and
with
the
droppings
of
these
cows
they
absolve
themselves
from
their
sins
as
if
with
holy
water
they
have
for
a
commandment
to
confess
their
sins
to
the
brahman
priests
but
they
do
not
do
it
except
only
those
who
are
very
religious
amiguos
de
dios
they
give
in
excuse
that
they
feel
a
shame
to
confess
themselves
to
another
man
and
say
that
it
is
sufficient
to
confess
themselves
alone
after
approaching
god
for
he
who
does
not
do
so
does
not
acquire
grace
thus
they
fulfil
the
command
in
one
way
or
another
but
they
do
it
so
seldom
in
reality
that
they
may
be
said
to
neglect
this
command
to
confess
this
kingdom
of
bisnaga
is
all
heathen
the
women
have
the
custom
of
burning
themselves
when
their
husbands
die
and
hold
it
an
honour
to
do
so
when
therefore
their
husbands
die
they
mourn
with
their
relations
and
those
of
their
husbands
but
they
hold
that
the
wife
who
weeps
beyond
measure
has
no
desire
to
go
in
search
of
her
husband
and
the
mourning
finished
their
relations
speak
to
them
advising
them
to
burn
themselves
and
not
to
dishonour
their
generation
after
that
it
is
said
they
place
the
dead
man
on
a
bed
with
a
canopy
of
branches
and
covered
with
flowers
and
they
put
the
woman
on
the
back
of
a
worthless
horse
and
she
goes
after
them
with
many
jewels
on
her
and
covered
with
roses
she
carries
a
mirror
in
her
hand
and
in
the
other
a
branch
of
flowers
and
she
goes
accompanied
by
many
kinds
of
music
and
his
relations
go
with
her
with
much
pleasure
a
man
goes
also
playing
on
a
small
drum
and
he
sings
songs
to
her
telling
her
that
she
is
going
to
join
her
husband
and
she
answers
also
in
singing
that
so
she
will
do
as
soon
as
she
arrives
at
the
place
where
they
are
always
burned
she
waits
with
the
musicians
till
her
husband
is
burned
whose
body
they
place
in
a
very
large
pit
that
has
been
made
ready
for
it
covered
with
much
firewood
before
they
light
the
fire
his
mother
or
his
nearest
relative
takes
a
vessel
of
water
on
the
head
and
a
firebrand
in
the
hand
and
goes
three
times
round
the
pit
and
at
each
round
makes
a
hole
in
the
pot
and
when
these
three
rounds
are
done
breaks
the
pot
which
is
small
and
throws
the
torch
into
the
pit
then
they
apply
the
fire
and
when
the
body
is
burned
comes
the
wife
with
all
the
feasters
and
washes
her
feet
and
then
a
brahman
performs
over
her
certain
ceremonies
according
to
their
law
and
when
he
has
finished
doing
this
she
draws
off
with
her
own
hand
all
the
jewels
that
she
wears
and
divides
them
among
her
female
relatives
and
if
she
has
sons
she
commends
them
to
her
most
honoured
relatives
when
they
have
taken
off
all
she
has
on
even
her
good
clothes
they
put
on
her
some
common
yellow
cloths
and
her
relatives
take
her
hand
and
she
takes
a
branch
in
the
other
and
goes
singing
and
running
to
the
pit
where
the
fire
is
and
then
mounts
on
some
steps
which
are
made
high
up
by
the
pit
before
they
do
this
they
go
three
times
round
the
fire
and
then
she
mounts
the
steps
and
holds
in
front
of
her
a
mat
that
prevents
her
from
seeing
the
fire
they
throw
into
the
fire
a
cloth
containing
rice
and
another
in
which
they
carry
betel
leaves
and
her
comb
and
mirror
with
which
she
adorned
herself
saying
that
all
these
are
needed
to
adorn
herself
by
her
husband
side
finally
she
takes
leave
of
all
and
puts
a
pot
of
oil
on
her
head
and
casts
herself
into
the
fire
with
such
courage
that
it
is
a
thing
of
wonder
and
as
soon
as
she
throws
herself
in
the
relatives
are
ready
with
firewood
and
quickly
cover
her
with
it
and
after
this
is
done
they
all
raise
loud
lamentations
when
a
captain
dies
however
many
wives
he
has
they
all
burn
themselves
and
when
the
king
dies
they
do
the
same
this
is
the
custom
throughout
all
the
country
of
the
heathen
except
with
that
caste
of
people
called
telugas
amongst
whom
the
wives
are
buried
alive
with
their
husbands
when
they
die
these
go
with
much
pleasure
to
the
pit
inside
of
which
are
made
two
seats
of
earth
one
for
him
and
one
for
her
and
they
place
each
one
on
his
own
seat
and
cover
them
in
little
by
little
till
they
are
covered
up
and
so
the
wife
dies
with
the
husband
chapter
of
the
ceremonies
practised
at
the
death
of
brahmans
when
a
brahman
is
sick
before
he
dies
they
send
to
call
the
learned
brahmans
who
are
his
priests
so
that
they
should
come
to
pray
and
console
the
sick
man
and
they
talk
to
him
of
the
affairs
of
his
soul
and
what
he
must
do
to
save
it
bidding
him
spend
money
in
alms
after
this
ceremony
is
over
they
make
the
brahman
priests
shave
the
sick
man
head
and
after
the
shaving
they
bid
them
wash
it
and
after
the
washing
it
is
their
custom
to
bring
into
their
houses
a
cow
with
a
calf
there
are
very
few
brahmans
however
poor
they
be
who
do
not
have
one
to
live
in
their
house
which
cow
when
they
have
finished
washing
the
man
head
they
take
a
turban
and
tie
it
to
its
neck
and
put
the
end
of
the
turban
into
the
hand
of
the
sick
man
and
he
gives
it
and
the
calf
in
alms
for
his
soul
to
those
priests
who
perform
these
ceremonies
on
that
day
he
gives
alms
according
to
his
position
and
gives
to
eat
to
some
brahmans
who
are
invited
and
who
come
there
for
the
purpose
they
believe
that
when
these
ceremonies
are
made
for
the
sick
man
if
he
is
to
live
he
is
soon
cured
of
his
infirmity
and
if
not
that
he
soon
dies
after
the
death
of
the
sick
man
they
have
the
ground
washed
upon
which
he
lay
and
after
the
washing
they
take
and
spread
it
over
the
ground
and
place
the
body
on
the
top
of
this
dung
they
hold
that
a
sick
man
who
dies
on
a
cot
or
on
anything
except
only
on
the
ground
commits
a
mortal
sin
as
soon
as
the
body
is
laid
on
the
ground
they
make
for
it
a
bier
covered
with
boughs
of
the
and
before
they
place
the
body
on
the
bier
they
wash
it
well
with
pure
water
and
anoint
it
with
oil
and
they
place
by
the
body
branches
of
sweet
basil
and
cover
it
with
a
new
cloth
and
so
place
it
in
the
bier
then
one
of
his
relatives
takes
the
bier
on
one
side
and
they
call
three
other
brahmans
whosoever
they
may
be
to
aid
them
to
lift
it
and
so
they
carry
it
to
the
place
where
they
are
to
burn
it
accompanied
by
many
brahmans
who
go
singing
in
front
of
the
corpse
in
front
of
all
goes
his
son
if
he
has
one
or
next
younger
brother
or
nearest
relative
with
fire
in
the
hand
for
the
burning
as
soon
as
they
arrive
at
the
place
where
they
have
to
burn
the
body
they
scatter
money
according
to
their
ability
and
then
put
the
fire
to
it
and
they
wait
there
till
the
whole
body
is
consumed
and
then
all
go
and
wash
their
bodies
in
a
tank
and
afterwards
return
each
one
to
his
house
the
son
or
brother
or
relation
who
put
the
fire
is
obliged
to
sleep
on
the
ground
where
the
man
died
for
nine
nights
and
after
the
lapse
of
nine
days
from
the
death
come
the
priests
and
learned
men
and
they
command
to
shave
the
head
of
this
man
during
these
nine
days
they
feed
the
poor
and
they
give
them
the
dead
clothes
and
they
give
the
cot
with
its
bed
in
alms
to
the
priests
with
some
money
in
addition
if
he
is
a
rich
man
they
give
gardens
and
other
things
in
alms
to
many
brahmans
when
ten
days
are
finished
and
the
son
has
been
shaved
he
goes
to
the
place
where
they
burned
his
father
or
his
brother
and
they
perform
many
ceremonies
over
the
ashes
and
bones
that
remain
unburned
then
they
put
them
in
a
small
vessel
and
make
a
pit
in
the
ground
and
bury
them
in
it
and
keep
them
thus
guarded
and
buried
in
order
afterwards
to
send
the
bones
to
be
thrown
into
a
sacred
river
which
is
distant
from
goa
over
one
thousand
leagues
there
is
a
very
large
temple
there
the
object
of
many
pilgrimages
and
they
hold
that
every
pilgrim
who
dies
there
is
saved
and
goes
to
paradise
and
also
every
dead
man
whose
bones
are
thrown
into
that
river
in
spite
of
this
they
in
reality
take
very
few
people
there
the
heir
or
the
father
or
son
of
the
dead
man
is
obliged
from
the
day
of
the
death
for
eleven
days
to
give
food
to
brahmans
and
until
days
to
three
others
until
twelve
days
again
he
feeds
seven
brahmans
and
until
days
gives
to
eat
to
the
three
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
he
gives
food
to
three
others
and
thenceforward
until
one
year
is
finished
he
gives
meals
once
a
month
to
three
brahmans
they
do
this
in
honour
of
the
trinity
for
the
soul
of
the
deceased
when
this
year
is
over
he
gives
no
more
alms
except
that
each
year
on
the
day
on
which
the
death
happened
he
feeds
six
brahmans
namely
three
in
honour
of
the
trinity
and
three
for
the
persons
of
his
father
grandfather
and
who
thus
seemingly
eat
together
thus
he
obtains
favour
with
god
and
for
these
expenses
they
beg
alms
of
the
brahmans
if
they
are
poor
these
give
him
all
help
for
it
before
they
dine
they
wash
the
feet
of
all
six
and
during
the
meal
some
ceremonies
are
performed
by
brahman
priests
who
come
there

purpose
chapter
a
diamonds
however
much
it
may
at
first
sight
appear
that
our
chroniclers
have
exaggerated
in
their
description
of
the
wealth
of
the
hindu
sovereign
and
his
nobles
and
of
the
wonderful
display
of
jewels
made
on
days
of
high
festival
by
the
ladies
of
their
households
an
account
of
which
is
given
us
by
paes
i
for
one
see
little
reason
for
doubt
nuniz
distinctly
states
that
the
diamond
mines
in
their
day
the
richest
in
the
world
were
farmed
out
on
condition
that
all
stones
above
twenty
mangellins
in
weight
about
carats
were
sent
to
the
raya
for
his
personal
use
and
there
must
have
been
many
of
these
barradas
above
states
that
according
to
rumour
even
after
the
downfall
of
the
empire
the
king
at
chandragiri
in
had
no
less
than
three
large
chests
full
of
diamonds
in
his
possession
and
every
traveller
and
chronicler
has
something
to
say
on
the
subject
the
principal
mines
were
on
the
north
bank
of
the
krishna
river
and
in
the
kurnool
and
anantapur
countries
notably
at
vajra
karur
generically
these
are
known
as
the
mines
of
golkonda
and
the
phrase
has
passed
into
a
proverb

doth
reape
great
profitte

he
causeth
them
to
be
straightly
watched

hath

them
out
with

to

beg
to
refer
those
interested
in
the
subject
it
is
clear
that
this
hen

diamond
could
not
be
the
fame
as
sultan
babar
because
the
former
was
taken
at
vijayanagar
in
whereas
sultan
babar
was
received
by
his
son
humayun
at

in
and
could
not
have
been
forty
years
later
in

possession
of
the
hindu

has
shown
that
probably
the
is
identical
with
the

was
then
this

the

probably
not
if
we
had
been
told
that
the
hen
egg
when

been

the
proof

would
be
conclusive
since
the

certainly
uncut

there
is
no

available
on
this
point
the
hen

was
apparently
taken
by
the

fabulous
firishtah
writes
they
found
in
the
temples
prodigious
spoils
such
as
idols
of
gold
adorned
with
precious
stones
and
other
rich
effects
consecrated

worship
and
malik
presented
his
sovereign
with
elephants
horses
mans
of
gold
several
boxes
of
jewels
and
pearls
and
other
precious
effects
when
we
come
to
estimate
the
amount
of
gold
we
are
met
with
a
difficulty
as
there
are
many
varieties
of
mans
in
india
the
variation
being
as
much
as
from
lbs
in
travancore
to
lbs
in
ahmadnagar
the
madras
man
weighs
the
bombay
man
lbs
hawkins
writing
in
gives
lbs
to
the
man
middleton
in
lbs
now
firishtah
had
more
to
do
with
ahmadnagar
than
any
other
part
of
india
and
if
his
estimate
was
based
on
the
man
of
that
tract
malik
kafur
mans
of
gold
would
have
amounted
to
the
enormous
sum
of
lbs
weight
it
is
hardly
likely
that
firishtah
would
have
had
in
his
mind
the
travancore
man
even
if
he
was
thinking
of
the
madras
man
which
is
not
likely
his
estimate
of
the
weight
of
the
gold
carried
off
amounted
to
lbs
whether
we
accept
these
amounts
or
not
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
that
the
richness
of
the
temples
was
very
great
and
the
reason
is
easy
to
see
the
country
had
always
been
subject
to
hindu
kings
and
treasures
had
year
by
year
accumulated
the
brahmans
exacted
gifts
and
payments
from
the
people
on
all
occasions
kings
and
chiefs
merchants
and
landowners
vied
with
one
another
in
presenting
rich
offerings
to
their
favourite
places
of
worship
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
this
practice
had
been
going
on
from
time
immemorial
it
need
be
no
matter
for
wonder
that
the
man
who
first
violently
despoiled
the
sacred
buildings
departed
from
the

lxxxvi
firishtah
was
a
persian
of
good
family
and
was
born
about
early
in
his
life
he
was
taken
by
his
father
to
india
and
resided
all
his
life
at
the
court
of
the
nizam
shahs
of
ahmadnagar
rejoicing
in
royal
patronage
he
appears
to
have
begun
to
compile
his
historical
works
at
an
early
age
since
his
account
of
the
bijapur
kings
was
finished
in
he
appears
to
have
died
not
long
after
the
year
which
is
the
latest
date
referred
to
in
any
of
his
writings
according
to
tradition
the
wealth
carried
off
was
something
fabulous
see
appendix
b
it
is
highly
probable
that
amongst
the
hills
and
crags
about
the
upper
fortress
of
anegundi
there
may
be
found
remains
of
a
date
long
prior
to
the
fourteenth
century
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
up
to
now
no
scientific
examination
of
that
tract
which
lies
in
the
present
territories
of
haidarabad
has
been
carried
out
want
of
leisure
always
prevented
my
undertaking
any
exploration
north
of
the
river
but
from
the
heights
of
vijayanagar
on
the
south
side
i
often
looked
wistfully
at
the
long
lines
of
fortification
visible
on
the
hills
opposite
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
ere
long
the
government
of
madras
may
place
us
in
possession
of
a
complete
map
of
vijayanagar
and
its
environs

the
whole
area
enclosed
by
the
outermost
line
of
fortifications

including
the
outworks
and
suburbs
hospett

anegundi

both

the

firishtah

different

he

to

but
i
consider
the
narrative
of
ibn
batuta
to
be
far
the
most
reliable
since
he
wrote
from
personal
experience
while
firishtah
compiled

a
half

of
almost
every
kingdom
principality
or
large
zamindari
in
southern
india
the
usual
variant
being
the
discovery
of
a
hidden
treasure
i
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
derivation
though
often
given
is
erroneous
and
that
the
name
was
city
of
victory
not
city
of

vijaya

iii
while
on

to

in
was
shown
by
one
ramappa
varmika
a
sanskrit
book
in
his
possession
called
the
vidyarayana
sikka
which
relates
that
the
founders
of
vijayanagar
were
hukka
and
bukka
guards
of
the
treasury
of
pratapa

these
young

the
latter
founded
for
them
the
city
of
vijayanagar
this
was
in
and
hukka
was
made
first
king
but
this
story
entirely
leaves
out
of
account
the
most
important
point
how
could
two
brothers
flying
from
a
captured
capital
and
a
conquered
kingdom
suddenly
establish
in
a
new
country
a
great
city

this
is
in
itself
absurd
and
carries
with
it
its
own
refutation
it
would
be
manifestly
impossible
for
the
city
to
be
built
in
so
short
a
time
and
moreover
it
would
have
been
sheer
waste
of
time
for
the
prince
to
have
employed
himself
in
such
a
way
the
sentence
was
probably
introduced
merely
to
account
for
that
city
having
been
built
about
this
period
firishtah
says
on
according
to
the
but
the
author
of
the
latter
work
says
that
reigned
thirteen
years
ten
months
and
days
which
would
make
the
date
of
his
death
the
of
or
january
he
does
not
therefore
appear
to
be
very
accurate
firishtah
gives
in
words
the
length
of
his
reign
as
eleven
years
two
months
and
seven
days

published
by
rice
state

the

who
commanded

about

was

in

translation
i
briggs
ii
there
is
a
confusion
of
dates
here
in
firishtah
but
he
definitely
fixes
the
month
and
year
when
muhammad
set
out
and
we
may
accept
it
for
the
present
the
implies
that
the
war
against
vijayanagar
took
place
prior
to
the
campaign
against
warangal
firishtah
places
it

we
must
never
forget
that
the
narrative
of

is
necessarily
tinged
with
bias
in

of
the

and
that
it

remotest
degree
resembling

relates
a
story
which
is
hardly
sufficient
to
account
for
bukka
he
says
that

went
one
day

on

a
tiger
of
great
ferocity
and
shot
it
with
a
single
arrow
through

the
idolaters
upon
hearing
of
this
exploit
were
struck
with
dread
at
the
present
day
at
least
there
are
no
tigers
in
the
country
between
adoni
and

are

and
means
little
or

see
the
tale
told

of
the

is
very
common
in

was
generally
applied
to
the
crown
prince
shawwal
firishtah
scott
gives
the
length
of
the
reign
and
his
figures
yield
this
result
the
therefore
probably
close
to
one
of
the
old
irrigation
channels
supplied
by
dams
constructed
across
this
river
under
the
rayas
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
this
story
with
the
fact
of
the
raya
tender
age
at
this
date
for
i
think
it
is
certain
that
he
was
then
quite
a
boy
is
it
possible
that
the
muhammadan
chroniclers
from
whom
firishtah
obtained
the
narrative
mistook
for
the
king
an
adult
member
of
the
family
who
commanded
the
army
such
mistakes
were
certainly
made
in
later
years
the
chroniclers
seem
to
have
taken
little
pains
to
ascertain
the
actual
names
of
the
hindu
kings
it
must
however
be
noted
that
a
little
later
on
firishtah
speaks
of
deva
raya
son
there
is
no
clue
as
to
where
this
event
took
place
except
that
it
was
not
very
close
to
vijayanagar
the
sultan
must
have
been
near
some
hills
with
a
plain
below
because
he
met
with
open
ground
difficult
for
a
horse
to
cross
in
his
eagerness
to
reach
a
mud
enclosure
in
a
plain
the
description
is
applicable
to
numberless
places
in
the
vicinity
and
it
is
useless
to
speculate
as
he
was
on
horseback
it
is
possible
that
he
was
riding
down
antelope
before
ahmad
accession
his
brother
the
late
sultan
firuz
had
designed
in
order
to
secure
the
throne
for
his
own
son
hasan
that
ahmad
should
be
blinded
ahmad
was
warned
of
this
and
left
kulbarga
in
time
to
secure
his
safety
this
is
the
muhammadan
version
nothing
is
said
regarding
this
tribute
by
firishtah
in
describing
the
terms
of
the
peace
of
it
is
possible
however
that
tribute
was
really
paid
it
had
apparently
been
exacted
by
muhammad
shaw
bahmani
and
agreed
to
by
bukka
raya
who
confirmed
the
arrangement
on
the
accession
of
daud
shah
brother
muhammad
see
above
p
this
looks
as
if
he
was
really
paraded
with
ignominy
as
a
vanquished
inferior
and
so
displayed
to
the
muhammadan
troops
if
he
had
desired
to
do
him
honour
the
sultan
himself
would
have
met
the
prince
and
personally
escorted
him
as
representing
his
father
moreover
the
prince
was
only
permitted
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
and
was
taken
almost
as
a
prisoner
for
many

along

this

this

refers
to
the
highly
decorated
building
in

i
believe
to
have
been
the

offices
surrounded

there

exactly
confirming
this
whole
story
it
relates
that
the

captured

other
places
then
bezvada

kondapalle
and
finally

to

only
about

but
we
must
not
forget
the
hindu
custom
of
the
marriages
of
girls
while
infants
if
this
refers
to
krishna
raya
capture
of
that
place
in
it
is
to
be
noted
here
that
nuniz
asserts
that
it
was
taken
not
from
the
muhammadans
but
from
the
king
of
orissa
firishtah
account
of
this
is
that
ismail
adil
joined
with
amir
barid
in
an
attack
on
telingana
and
laid
siege
to
kovilkonda
vijayanagar
had
no
part
in
the
causes
of
the
campaign
firishtah
tells
this
story
of
jamshid
qutb
shah
successor
so
says
nuniz
but
as
before
stated
firishtah
differs
in
my
opinion
we
must
accept
the
former
as
correct
for
his
account
is
so
graphic
and
detailed
that
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
he
could
have
been
mistaken
firishtah
did
not
write
for
many
years
later
and
was
much
more
liable
to
en
on
several
portuguese
were
present
at
the
siege
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
either
nuniz
was
there
himself
or
obtained
his
information
from
those
who
were
so
the
story
bears
all
the
marks
of
a
personal
narrative
pp
to
below
on
the
ordnance
map
i
observe
on
the
thirteen
miles
of
raichur
a
plan
of
what
appears
to
be
a
large
fortified
camp
with
its
base
on
the
river
the
average
of
its
west
south
and
east
faces
being
about
a

each
it
lies
just

krishna
rivers

two
miles
west
of
the

railway
station
on
the

what
this
may
be
i
know
not

it
looks

the
remains

an

erected

some

desired
to
make

that

that

him

hussain

straits

went
to

rose
on

entering

he
did

kissed

the

called

it

a

of
the

the

from
the

this

if

be

the

this
would
accurately
describe
it
it

was

the
word
used
is
romeyra

may
mean
either
a

the

as
i

equally
well
to

technical

venture
to
think
that

so

he
states
that
the

wrote

so
that
the
affair
might
become
widely
known
to
all
cide
mercar
either
tempted
by
the
large
sum
of
money
in
his
charge
or
swayed
by
a
letter
which
they
say
was
sent
to
him
by
the
hidalcao
when
he
arrived
at
a
tanadaria
called
ponda
three
leagues
from
goa
fled
to
the
hidalcao
from
there
the
hidalcao
as
soon
as
he
arrived
sent
him
to
chaul
saying
hat
he
bestowed
on
him
this
tanadaria
as
he
was
an
honourable
man
of
the
family
of
mahamed
but
in
a
few
days
he
disappeared
from
there

they
say
that
the

ordered
his
murder

he
had
taken
from

however
there
has

the

in

possible
that

of

in

distinguished
himself
by
the
construction
of

at

true

think
that
the
meaning
is
as
given
it
will
be
observed
below
that
the
kingdom
was
divided
into
provinces
or
estates
each
one
entrusted
to
a
noble
who
farmed
the
revenue
to
his
own
advantage
paying
a
fixed
sum
every
year
to
the
king
in
the
case
of
narvara
the
treasurer
of
the
jewels
his
estate
is
described
as
bordering
on
the
country
of
bisnaga
and
as
this
expression
can
not
refer
to
the
entire
country
ruled
by
the
king
it
must
be
taken
in
a
limited
sense
as
applying
to
the
king
own
personal
lands
his
home
farm
so
to
speak
the
system
is
well
known
in
india
where
a
prince
holds
what
are
called
khas
lands
lands
held
privately
for
his
own
personal
use
and
benefit
as
distinct
from
the
lands
held
under
him
by
others
the
revenue
of
which
last
ought
to
go
to
the
public
purse
note
that
madura
is
not
mentioned
in
these
lists
and
yet
it
would
appear
that
a
nayakka
or
subordinate
chief
of
vijayanagar
had
been
ruling
at
that
place
since
nelson
in

he
ruled

from

seems
to
have
been

first

muttu
virappa
is
stated
in
the
narrative
of
the
portuguese
writer
barradas
above
to
have
paid

tribute

to
the
vijayanagar
king
at
chandragiri
of

he
had
several
vassal

is
possible
that
in
the
time
of

not
one
of
the
greater

that
it
became
