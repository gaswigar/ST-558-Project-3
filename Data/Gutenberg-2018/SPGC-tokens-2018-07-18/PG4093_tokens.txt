introduction
by
william
archer
introduction
from
munich
on
june
ibsen
wrote
to
the
swedish
poet
count
carl
soilsky
our
intention
has
all
along
been
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
tyrol
again
but
circumstances
are
against
our
doing
so
i
am
at
present
engaged
upon
a
new
dramatic
work
which
for
several
reasons
has
made
very
slow
progress
and
i
do
not
leave
munich
until
i
can
take
with
me
the
completed
first
draft
there
is
little
or
no
prospect
of
my
being
able
to
complete
it
in
july
ibsen
did
not
leave
munich
at
all
that
season
on
october
he
wrote
at
present
i
am
utterly
engrossed
in
a
new
play
not
one
leisure
hour
have
i
had
for
several
months
three
weeks
later
november
he
wrote
to
his
french
translator
count
prozor
my
new
play
is
finished
the
manuscript
went
off
to
copenhagen
the
day
before
yesterday
it
produces
a
curious
feeling
of
emptiness
to
be
thus
suddenly
separated
from
a
work
which
has
occupied
one
time
and
thoughts
for
several
months
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
but
it
is
a
good
thing
too
to
have
done
with
it
the
constant
intercourse
with
the
fictitious
personages
was
beginning
to
make
me
quite
nervous
to
the
same
correspondent
he
wrote
on
december
the
title
of
the
play
is
my
intention
in
giving
it
this
name
was
to
indicate
that
hedda
as
a
personality
is
to
be
regarded
rather
as
her
daughter
than
as
her
husband
wife
it
was
not
my
desire
to
deal
in
this
play
with
problems
what
i
principally
wanted
to
do
was
to
depict
human
beings
human
emotions
and
human
destinies
upon
a
groundwork
of
certain
of
the
social
conditions
and
principles
of
the
present
day
so
far
we
read
the
history
of
the
play
in
the
official
correspondence
some
interesting
glimpses
into
the
poet
moods
during
the
period
between
the
completion
of
lady
from
the
and
the
publication
of
are
to
be
found
in
the
series
of
letters
to
fraulein
emilie
bardach
of
vienna
published
by
george
brandes
this
young
lady
ibsen
met
at
gossensass
in
the
tyrol
in
the
autumn
of
the
record
of
their
brief
friendship
belongs
to
the
history
of
master
rather
than
to
that
of
but
the
allusions
to
his
work
in
his
letters
to
her
during
the
winter
of
demand
some
examination
so
early
as
october
he
writes
to
her
a
new
poem
begins
to
dawn
in
me
i
will
execute
it
this
winter
and
try
to
transfer
to
it
the
bright
atmosphere
of
the
summer
but
i
feel
that
it
will
end
in
sadness
such
is
my
nature
was
this
dawning
poem
or
was
it
rather
master
that
was
germinating
in
his
mind
who
shall
say
the
latter
hypothesis
seems
the
more
probable
for
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
at
any
stage
in
the
incubation
of
he
can
have
conceived
it
as
even
beginning
in
gaiety
a
week
later
however
he
appears
to
have
made
up
his
mind
that
the
time
had
not
come
for
the
poetic
utilisation
of
his
recent
experiences
he
writes
on
october
here
i
sit
as
usual
at
my
now
i
would
fain
work
but
am
unable
to
my
fancy
indeed
is
very
active
but
it
always
wanders
away
ours
i
can
not
repress
my
summer
memories
nor
do
i
wish
to
i
live
through
my
experience
again
and
again
and
yet
again
to
transmute
it
all
into
a
poem
i
find
in
the
meantime
impossible
clearly
then
he
felt
that
his
imagination
ought
to
have
been
engaged
on
some
theme
having
no
relation
to
his
summer
experiences
the
theme
no
doubt
of
in
his
next
letter
dated
october
he
writes
do
not
be
troubled
because
i
can
not
in
the
meantime
create
in
reality
i
am
for
ever
creating
or
at
any
rate
dreaming
of
something
which
when
in
the
fulness
of
time
it
ripens
will
reveal
itself
as
a
creation
on
november
he
says
i
am
very
busily
occupied
with
preparations
for
my
new
poem
i
sit
almost
the
whole
day
at
my
go
out
only
in
the
evening
for
a
little
while
the
five
following
letters
contain
no
allusion
to
the
play
but
on
september
he
wrote
my
wife
and
son
are
at
present
at
riva
on
the
lake
of
garda
and
will
probably
remain
there
until
the
middle
of
october
or
even
longer
thus
i
am
quite
alone
here
and
can
not
get
away
the
new
play
on
which
i
am
at
present
engaged
will
probably
not
be
ready
until
november
though
i
sit
at
my
daily
and
almost
the
whole
day
long
here
ends
the
history
of
so
far
as
the
letters
carry
us
its
hard
clear
outlines
and
perhaps
somewhat
bleak
atmosphere
seem
to
have
resulted
from
a
sort
of
reaction
against
the
sentimental
dreamery
begotten
of
his
gossensass
experiences
he
sought
refuge
in
the
chill
materialism
of
hedda
from
the
ardent
transcendentalism
of
hilda
whom
he
already
heard
knocking
at
the
door
he
was
not
yet
in
the
mood
to
deal
with
her
on
the
plane
of
poetry
was
published
in
copenhagen
on
december
this
was
the
first
of
ibsen
plays
to
be
translated
from
and
published
in
england
and
america
almost
simultaneously
with
its
first
appearance
in
scandinavia
the
earliest
theatrical
performance
took
place
at
the
residenz
theater
munich
on
the
last
day
of
january
in
the
presence
of
the
poet
frau
playing
the
the
lessing
theater
berlin
followed
suit
on
february
not
till
february
was
the
play
seen
in
copenhagen
with
fru
hennings
as
hedda
on
the
following
night
it
was
given
for
the
first
time
in
christiania
the
norwegian
hedda
being
froken
constance
bruun
it
was
this
production
which
the
poet
saw
when
he
visited
the
christiania
theater
for
the
first
time
after
his
return
to
norway
august
it
would
take
pages
to
give
even
the
baldest
list
of
the
productions
and
revivals
of
in
scandinavia
and
germany
where
it
has
always
ranked
among
ibsen
most
popular
works
the
admirable
production
of
the
play
by
miss
elizabeth
robins
and
miss
marion
lea
at
the
vaudeville
theatre
london
april
may
rank
as
the
second
great
step
towards
the
popularisation
of
ibsen
in
england
the
first
being
the
production
of
doll
in
miss
robins
afterwards
repeated
her
fine
performance
of
hedda
many
times
in
london
in
the
english
provinces
and
in
new
york
the
character
has
also
been
acted
in
london
by
eleonora
duse
and
as
i
write
march
by
patrick
campbell
at
the
court
theatre
in
australia
and
america
hedda
has
frequently
been
acted
by
miss
nance
and
other
actresses
quite
recently
by
a
russian
actress
madame
alla
nazimova
who
playing
in
english
seems
to
have
made
a
notable
success
both
in
this
part
and
in
nora
the
first
french
hedda
gabler
was
mlle
marthe
brandes
who
played
the
part
at
the
vaudeville
theatre
paris
on
december
the
performance
being
introduced
by
a
lecture
by
jules
lemaitre
in
holland
in
italy
in
russia
the
play
has
been
acted
times
without
number
in
short
as
might
easily
have
been
foretold
it
has
rivalled
doll
in
popularity
it
has
been
suggested
i
think
without
sufficient
ground
that
ibsen
deliberately
conceived
as
an
international
play
and
that
the
scene
is
really
the
west
end
of
any
european
city
to
me
it
seems
quite
clear
that
ibsen
had
christiania
in
mind
and
the
christiania
of
a
somewhat
earlier
period
than
the
the
electric
cars
telephones
and
other
conspicuous
factors
in
the
life
of
a
modern
capital
are
notably
absent
from
the
play
there
is
no
electric
light
in
secretary
falk
villa
it
is
still
the
habit
for
ladies
to
return
on
foot
from
evening
parties
with
gallant
swains
escorting
them
this
suburbanism
which
so
distressed
the
london
critics
of
was
characteristic
of
the
christiania
ibsen
himself
had
known
in
the
the
christiania
of
rather
than
of
the
greatly
extended
and
modernised
city
of
the
end
of
the
century
moreover
lovborg
allusions
to
the
fiord
and
the
suggested
picture
of
sheriff
elvsted
his
family
and
his
avocations
are
all
distinctively
norwegian
the
truth
seems
to
be
very
simple
the
environment
and
the
subsidiary
personages
are
all
thoroughly
national
but
hedda
herself
is
an
international
type
a
product
of
civilisation
by
no
means
peculiar
to
norway
we
can
not
point
to
any
individual
model
or
models
who
sat
to
ibsen
for
the
character
of
hedda
the
late
grant
allen
declared
that
hedda
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
girl
we
take
down
to
dinner
in
london
nineteen
times
out
of
twenty
in
which
case
ibsen
must
have
suffered
from
a
superfluidity
of
models
rather
than
from
any
difficulty
in
finding
one
but
the
fact
is
that
in
this
as
in
all
other
instances
the
word
model
must
be
taken
in
a
very
different
sense
from
that
in
which
it
is
commonly
used
in
painting
ibsen
undoubtedly
used
models
for
this
trait
and
that
but
never
for
a
whole
figure
if
his
characters
can
be
called
portraits
at
all
they
are
composite
portraits
even
when
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
the
initial
impulse
towards
the
creation
of
a
particular
character
came
from
some
individual
the
original
figure
is
entirely
transmuted
in
the
process
of
harmonisation
with
the
dramatic
scheme
we
need
not
therefore
look
for
a
definite
prototype
of
hedda
but
brandes
shows
that
two
of
that
lady
exploits
were
probably
suggested
by
the
anecdotic
history
of
the
day
ibsen
had
no
doubt
heard
how
the
wife
of
a
norwegian
composer
in
a
fit
of
raging
jealousy
excited
by
her
husband
prolonged
absence
from
home
burnt
the
manuscript
of
a
symphony
which
he
had
just
finished
the
circumstances
under
which
hedda
burns
lovborg
manuscript
are
of
course
entirely
different
and
infinitely
more
dramatic
but
here
we
have
merely
another
instance
of
the
dramatisation
or
poetisation
of
the
raw
material
of
life
again
a
still
more
painful
incident
probably
came
to
his
knowledge
about
the
same
time
a
beautiful
and
very
intellectual
woman
was
married
to
a
man
who
had
been
addicted
to
drink
but
had
entirely
conquered
the
vice
one
day
a
mad
whim
seized
her
to
put
his
and
her
power
over
him
to
the
test
as
it
happened
to
be
his
birthday
she
rolled
into
his
study
a
small
keg
of
brandy
and
then
withdrew
she
returned
some
time
after
wards
to
find
that
he
had
broached
the
keg
and
lay
insensible
on
the
floor
in
this
anecdote
we
can
not
but
recognise
the
germ
not
only
of
hedda
temptation
of
lovborg
but
of
a
large
part
of
her
character
thus
says
brandes
out
of
small
and
scattered
traits
of
reality
ibsen
fashioned
his
and
profoundly
works
of
art
for
the
character
of
eilert
lovborg
again
ibsen
seem
unquestionably
to
have
borrowed
several
traits
from
a
definite
original
a
young
danish
man
of
letters
whom
brandes
calls
holm
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
ibsen
and
came
to
be
on
very
friendly
terms
with
him
one
day
ibsen
was
astonished
to
receive
in
munich
a
parcel
addressed
from
berlin
by
this
young
man
containing
without
a
word
of
explanation
a
packet
of
his
ibsen
letters
and
a
photograph
which
he
had
presented
to
holm
ibsen
brooded
and
brooded
over
the
incident
and
at
last
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
young
man
had
intended
to
return
her
letters
and
photograph
to
a
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
known
to
be
attached
and
had
in
a
fit
of
aberration
mixed
up
the
two
objects
of
his
worship
some
time
after
holm
appeared
at
ibsen
rooms
he
talked
quite
rationally
but
professed
to
have
no
knowledge
whatever
of
the
though
he
admitted
the
truth
of
ibsen
conjecture
that
the
belle
dame
sans
merci
had
demanded
the
return
of
her
letters
and
portrait
ibsen
was
determined
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
mystery
and
a
little
inquiry
into
his
young
friend
habits
revealed
the
fact
that
he
broke
his
fast
on
a
bottle
of
port
wine
consumed
a
bottle
of
rhine
wine
at
lunch
of
burgundy
at
dinner
and
finished
off
the
evening
with
one
or
two
more
bottles
of
port
then
he
heard
too
how
in
the
course
of
a
carouse
holm
had
lost
the
manuscript
of
a
book
and
in
these
traits
he
saw
the
outline
of
the
figure
of
eilert
lovborg
some
time
elapsed
and
again
ibsen
received
a
postal
packet
from
holm
this
one
contained
his
will
in
which
ibsen
figured
as
his
residuary
legatee
but
many
other
legatees
were
mentioned
in
the
instrument
all
of
them
ladies
such
as
fraulein
alma
rothbart
of
bremen
and
fraulein
elise
kraushaar
of
berlin
the
bequests
to
these
meritorious
spinsters
were
so
generous
that
their
sum
considerably
exceeded
the
amount
of
the
testator
property
ibsen
gently
but
firmly
declined
the
proffered
inheritance
but
holm
will
no
doubt
suggested
to
him
the
figure
of
that
mademoiselle
diana
who
is
heard
of
but
not
seen
in
and
enabled
him
to
add
some
further
traits
to
the
portraiture
of
lovborg
when
the
play
appeared
holm
recognised
himself
with
glee
in
the
character
of
the
bibulous
man
of
letters
and
thereafter
adopted
eilert
lovborg
as
his
pseudonym
i
do
not
therefore
see
why
brandes
should
suppress
his
real
name
but
i
willingly
imitate
him
in
erring
on
the
side
of
discretion
the
poor
fellow
died
several
years
ago
some
critics
have
been
greatly
troubled
as
to
the
precise
meaning
of
hedda
fantastic
vision
of
lovborg
with
in
his
hair
surely
this
is
a
very
obvious
image
or
symbol
of
the
beautiful
the
ideal
aspect
of
bacchic
elation
and
revelry
antique
art
or
i
am
much
mistaken
shows
us
many
figures
of
dionysus
himself
and
his
followers
with
entwined
their
hair
to
ibsen
mind
at
any
rate
the
image
had
long
been
familiar
in
act
iv
sc
when
peer
having
carried
off
anitra
finds
himself
in
a
particularly
festive
mood
he
cries
were
there
around
i
would
garland
my
brow
again
in
and
pt
ii
act
where
julian
in
the
procession
of
dionysus
impersonates
the
god
himself
it
is
directed
that
he
shall
wear
a
wreath
of
professor
dietrichson
relates
that
among
the
young
artists
whose
society
ibsen
frequented
during
his
first
years
in
rome
it
was
customary
at
their
little
festivals
for
the
revellers
to
deck
themselves
in
this
fashion
but
the
image
is
so
obvious
that
there
is
no
need
to
trace
it
to
any
personal
experience
the
attempt
to
place
hedda
among
obscurities
is
an
example
of
the
firm
resolution
not
to
understand
which
animated
the
criticism
of
the
brandes
has
dealt
very
severely
with
the
character
of
eilert
lovborg
alleging
that
we
can
not
believe
in
the
genius
attributed
to
him
but
where
is
he
described
as
a
genius
the
poet
represents
him
as
a
very
able
student
of
sociology
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
attributing
to
him
such
genius
as
must
necessarily
shine
forth
in
every
word
he
utters
brandes
indeed
declines
to
believe
even
in
his
ability
as
a
sociologist
on
the
ground
that
it
is
idle
to
write
about
the
social
development
of
the
future
to
our
prosaic
minds
he
says
it
may
seem
as
if
the
most
sensible
utterance
on
the
subject
is
that
of
the
fool
of
the
play
future
good
heavens
we
know
nothing
of
the
future
the
best
retort
to
this
criticism
is
that
which
eilert
himself
makes
there
a
thing
or
two
to
be
said
about
it
all
the
same
the
intelligent
forecasting
of
the
future
as
wells
has
shown
is
not
only
clearly
distinguishable
from
fantastic
utopianism
but
is
indispensable
to
any
large
statesmanship
or
enlightened
social
activity
with
very
real
and
very
great
respect
for
brandes
i
can
not
think
that
he
has
been
fortunate
in
his
treatment
of
lovborg
character
it
has
been
represented
as
an
absurdity
that
he
would
think
of
reading
abstracts
from
his
new
book
to
a
man
like
tesman
whom
he
despises
but
though
tesman
is
a
ninny
he
is
as
hedda
says
a
specialist
he
is
a
competent
plodding
student
of
his
subject
lovborg
may
quite
naturally
wish
to
see
how
his
new
method
or
his
excursion
into
a
new
field
strikes
the
average
scholar
of
the
tesman
type
he
is
in
fact
trying
it
on
the
dog
neither
an
unreasonable
nor
an
unusual
proceeding
there
is
no
doubt
a
certain
improbability
in
the
way
in
which
lovborg
is
represented
as
carrying
his
manuscript
around
and
especially
in
elvsted
production
of
his
rough
draft
from
her
pocket
but
these
are
mechanical
trifles
on
which
only
a
niggling
criticism
would
dream
of
laying
stress
of
all
ibsen
works
is
the
most
detached
the
most
objective
a
pure
and
simple
it
is
impossible
or
so
it
seems
to
me
to
extract
any
sort
of
general
idea
from
it
one
can
not
even
call
it
a
satire
unless
one
is
prepared
to
apply
that
term
to
the
record
of
a
case
in
a
work
of
criminology
reverting
to
dumas
dictum
that
a
play
should
contain
a
painting
a
judgment
an
ideal
we
may
say
the
fulfils
only
the
first
of
these
requirements
the
poet
does
not
even
pass
judgment
on
his
heroine
he
simply
paints
her
portrait
with
scientific
impassivity
but
what
a
portrait
how
searching
in
insight
how
brilliant
in
colouring
how
rich
in
detail
grant
allen
remark
above
quoted
was
of
course
a
whimsical
exaggeration
the
hedda
type
is
not
so
common
as
all
that
else
the
world
would
quickly
come
to
an
end
but
particular
traits
and
tendencies
of
the
hedda
type
are
very
common
in
modern
life
and
not
only
among
women
hyperaesthesia
lies
at
the
root
of
her
tragedy
with
a
keenly
critical
relentlessly
solvent
intelligence
she
combines
a
morbid
shrinking
from
all
the
gross
and
prosaic
detail
of
the
sensual
life
she
has
nothing
to
take
her
out
of
herself
not
a
single
intellectual
interest
or
moral
enthusiasm
she
cherishes
in
a
languid
way
a
petty
social
ambition
and
even
that
she
finds
obstructed
and
baffled
at
the
same
time
she
learns
that
another
woman
has
had
the
courage
to
love
and
venture
all
where
she
in
her
cowardice
only
hankered
and
refrained
her
malign
egoism
rises
up
uncontrolled
and
calls
to
its
aid
her
quick
and
subtle
intellect
she
ruins
the
other
woman
happiness
but
in
doing
so
incurs
a
danger
from
which
her
sense
of
personal
dignity
revolts
life
has
no
such
charm
for
her
that
she
cares
to
purchase
it
at
the
cost
of
squalid
humiliation
and
the
good
and
the
bad
in
her
alike
impel
her
to
have
done
with
it
all
and
a
ends
what
is
surely
one
of
the
most
poignant
in
literature
ibsen
brain
never
worked
at
higher
pressure
than
in
the
conception
and
adjustment
of
those
crowded
hours
in
which
hedda
tangled
in
the
web
of
will
and
circumstance
struggles
on
till
she
is
too
weary
to
struggle
any
more
it
may
not
be
superfluous
to
note
that
the
a
in
gabler
should
be
sounded
long
and
full
like
the
a
in
garden
not
like
the
a
in
gable
or
in
gabble
footnotes

makes
the
curious
assertion
that
the
character
of
thea
elvsted
was
in

borrowed
from
this

it
is
hard
to

and

softly
upon

word
i
do
believe
they
are
stirring

told
you

how
late

when

got

lot

beside

loss
what
to
do
with
the
bouquet
in

hand
i
declare
there

bit
of
room

down

places
it
on
the
piano
miss
tesman
so
you
got
a
new
mistress
now
my
dear
berta
heaven
knows
it
was
a
wrench
to
me
to
part
with
you
berta
on
the
point
of
weeping
and
do
you
think
it
was
hard
for
me
too
miss
after
all
the
blessed
years
i
been
with
you
and
miss
rina
miss
tesman
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
berta
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
george
ca
do
without
you
you
absolutely
ca
he
has
had
you
to
look
after
him
ever
since
he
was
a
little
boy
berta
ah
but
miss
julia
i
ca
help
thinking
of
miss
rina
lying
helpless
at
home
there
poor
thing
and
with
only
that
new
girl
too
she
never
learn
to
take
proper
care
of
an
invalid
miss
tesman
oh
i
shall
manage
to
train
her
and
of
course
you
know
i
shall
take
most
of
it
upon
myself
you
need
be
uneasy
about
my
poor
sister
my
dear
berta
berta
well
but
there
another
thing
miss
i
so
mortally
afraid
i
be
able
to
suit
the
young
mistress
miss
tesman
oh
well
just
at
first
there
may
be
one
or
two
things
berta
most
like
she
be
terrible
grand
in
her
ways
miss
tesman
well
you
ca
wonder
at
that
general
gabler
daughter
think
of
the
sort
of
life
she
was
accustomed
to
in
her
father
time
do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
see
her
riding
down
the
road
along
with
the
general
in
that
long
black
habit
and
with
feathers
in
her
hat
berta
yes
indeed
i
remember
well
enough
but
good
lord
i
should
never
have
dreamt
in
those
days
that
she
and
master
george
would
make
a
match
of
it
miss
tesman
nor
but
berta
while
i
think
of
it
in
future
you
must
say
master
george
you
must
say
tesman
berta
yes
the
young
mistress
spoke
of
that
too
last
night
the
moment
they
set
foot
in
the
house
is
it
true
then
miss
miss
tesman
yes
indeed
it
is
only
think
berta
some
foreign
university
has
made
him
a
doctor
while
he
has
been
abroad
you
understand
i
had
heard
a
word
about
it
until
he
told
me
himself
upon
the
pier
berta
well
well
he
clever
enough
for
anything
he
is
but
i
did
think
he
have
gone
in
for
doctoring
people
miss
tesman
no
no
it
not
that
sort
of
doctor
he
is
nods
significantly
but
let
me
tell
you
we
may
have
to
call
him
something
still
grander
before
long
berta
you
do
say
so
what
can
that
be
miss
miss
tesman
smiling
h
would
you
like
to
know
with
emotion
ah
dear
dear
if
my
poor
brother
could
only
look
up
from
his
grave
now
and
see
what
his
little
boy
has
grown
into
looks
around
but
bless
me
berta
why
have
you
done
this
taken
the
chintz
covers
off
all
the
furniture
berta
the
mistress
told
me
to
she
ca
abide
covers
on
the
chairs
she
says
miss
tesman
are
they
going
to
make
this
their
everyday
then
berta
yes

what
i
understood
from
the
mistress
master
george

doctor

said
nothing

the
right
into
the
inner
room
humming
to
himself

an
unstrapped
empty
portmanteau

a
man
of
rather
stout
with
a
round
open
cheerful
face
fair
hair
and
beard

wears
spectacles
and

somewhat
carelessly
dressed
in
comfortable
indoor
clothes

had
the
whole
of
that
portmanteau
chock
full
of
copies
of
the
documents
you
would
believe
how
much
i
have
picked
up
from
all
the
archives
i
have
been
examining
curious
old
details
that
no
one
has
had
any
idea
of
miss
tesman
yes
you
do
seem
to
have
wasted
your
time
on
your
wedding
trip

that
i
have
but
do
take
off
your
bonnet
auntie

here

me
untie
the
strings
eh
miss
tesman
while

does
so
well

is
just
as
if
you
were
still
at
home
with
us
tesman
with
the
bonnet
in
his
hand
looks
at
it
from
all
sides

investing
in
miss
tesman
i
bought
it
on
hedda
account
tesman

hedda
account

miss
tesman
yes
so
that
hedda
need
be
ashamed
of
me
if
we
happened
to
go
out
together
tesman
patting
her
cheek
you
always
think
of
everything
aunt
julia
lays
the
bonnet
on
a
chair
beside
the
table
and
now
look
here
suppose
we
sit
comfortably
on
the
sofa
and
have
a
little
chat
till
hedda
comes
they
seat
themselves
she
places
her
parasol
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
miss
tesman
takes
both
his
hands
and
looks
at
him
what
a
delight
it
is
to
have
you
again
as
large
as
life
before
my
very
eyes
george
my
george
my
poor
brother
own
boy
tesman
and
it
a
delight
for
me
too
to
see
you
again
aunt
julia
you
who
have
been
father
and
mother
in
one
to
me
miss
tesman
oh
yes
i
know
you
will
always
keep
a
place
in
your
heart
for
your
old
aunts
tesman
and
what
about
aunt
rina
no
improvement
eh
miss
tesman
oh
no
we
can
scarcely
look
for
any
improvement
in
her
case
poor
thing
there
she
lies
helpless
as
she
has
lain
for
all
these
years
but
heaven
grant
i
may
not
lose
her
yet
awhile
for
if
i
did
i
know
what
i
should
make
of
my
life
george
especially
now
that
i
have
you
to
look
after
any
more
tesman
patting
her
back
there
there
there
miss
tesman
suddenly
changing
her
tone
and
to
think
that
here
are
you
a
married
man
george
and
that
you
should
be
the
one
to
carry
off
hedda
gabler
the
beautiful
hedda
gabler
only
think
of
it
she
that
was
so
beset
with
admirers
tesman
hums
a
little
and
smiles
complacently
yes
i
fancy
i
have
several
good
friends
about
town
who
would
like
to
stand
in
my
shoes
eh
miss
tesman
and
then
this
fine
long
you
have
had
more
than
five
nearly
six
months
tesman
well
for
me
it
has
been
a
sort
of
tour
of
research
as
well
i
have
had
to
do
so
much
grubbing
among
old
records
and
to
read
no
end
of
books
too
auntie
miss
tesman
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
more
confidentially
and
lowering
her
voice
a
little
but
listen
now
george
have
you
nothing
nothing
special
to
tell
me
tesman
as
to
our
journey
miss
tesman
yes
tesman
no
i
do
know
of
anything
except
what
i
have
told
you
in
my
letters
i
had
a
doctor
degree
conferred
on
me
but
that
i
told
you
yesterday
miss
tesman
yes
yes
you
did
but
what
i
mean
is
have
you
any
any
expectations
tesman
expectations
miss
tesman
why
you
know
george
i
your
old
auntie
tesman
why
of
course
i
have
expectations
miss
tesman
ah
tesman
i
have
every
expectation
of
being
a
professor
one
of
these
days
miss
tesman
oh
yes
a
professor
tesman
indeed
i
may
say
i
am
certain
of
it
but
my
dear
auntie
you
know
all
about
that
already
miss
tesman
laughing
to
herself
yes
of
course
i
do
you
are
quite
right
there
changing
the
subject
but
we
were
talking
about
your
journey

must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
george
tesman
well
you
see
my
handsome
went
a
good
way
miss
tesman
but
i
ca
understand
how
you
can
have
made
it
go
far
enough
for
two
tesman
no
that
not
easy
to
understand
eh
miss
tesman
and
especially
travelling
with
a
lady
they
tell
me
that
makes
it
ever
so
much
more
expensive
tesman
yes
of
course
it
makes
it
a
little
more
expensive
but
hedda
had
to
have
this
trip
auntie
she
really
had
to
nothing
else
would
have
done
miss
tesman
no
no
i
suppose
not
a
seems
to
be
quite
indispensable
but
tell
me
now
have
you
gone
thoroughly
over
the
house
yet
tesman
yes
you
may
be
sure
i
have
i
have
been
afoot
ever
since
daylight
miss
tesman
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
tesman
i
delighted
quite
delighted
only
i
ca
think
what
we
are
to
do
with
the
two
empty
rooms
between
this
inner
parlour
and
hedda
bedroom
miss
tesman
laughing
oh
my
dear
george
i
daresay
you
may
find
some
use
for
them
in
the
course
of
time
tesman
why
of
course
you
are
quite
right
aunt
julia
you
mean
as
my
library
increases
eh
miss
tesman
yes
quite
so
my
dear
boy
it
was
your
library
i
was
thinking
of
tesman
i
am
specially
pleased
on
hedda
account
often
and
often
before
we
were
engaged
she
said
that
she
would
never
care
to
live
anywhere
but
in
secretary
falk
villa
miss
tesman
yes
it
was
lucky
that
this
very
house
should
come
into
the
market
just
after
you
had
started
tesman
yes
aunt
julia
the
luck
was
on
our
side
was
it
eh
miss
tesman
but
the
expense
my
dear
george
you
will
find
it
very
expensive
all
this
tesman
looks
at
her
a
little
cast
down
yes
i
suppose
i
shall
aunt
miss
tesman
oh
frightfully
tesman
how
much
do
you
think
in
round
numbers
eh
miss
tesman
oh
i
ca
even
guess
until
all
the
accounts
come
in
tesman
well
fortunately
judge
brack
has
secured
the
most
favourable
terms
for
me
so
he
said
in
a
letter
to
hedda
miss
tesman
yes
do
be
uneasy
my
dear
besides
i
have
given
security
for
the
furniture
and
all
the
carpets
tesman
security
you
my
dear
aunt
julia
what
sort
of
security
could
you
give
miss
tesman
i
have
given
a
mortgage
on
our
annuity
tesman
jumps
up
what
on
your
and
aunt
rina
annuity
miss
tesman
yes
i
knew
of
no
other
plan
you
see
tesman
placing
himself
before
her
have
you
gone
out
of
your
senses
auntie
your
annuity
it
all
that
you
and
aunt
rina
have
to
live
upon
miss
tesman
well
well
do
get
so
excited
about
it
it
only
a
matter
of
form
you
know
judge
brack
assured
me
of
that
it
was
he
that
was
kind
enough
to
arrange
the
whole
affair
for
me
a
mere
matter
of
form
he
said
tesman
yes
that
may
be
all
very
well
but
nevertheless
miss
tesman
you
will
have
your
own
salary
to
depend
upon
now
and
good
heavens
even
if
we
did
have
to
pay
up
a
little
to
eke
things
out
a
bit
at
the
start
why
it
would
be
nothing
but
a
pleasure
to
us
tesman
oh
auntie
will
you
never
be
tired
of
making
sacrifices
for
me
miss
tesman
rises
and
lays
her
hand
on
his
shoulders
have
i
any
other
happiness
in
this
world
except
to
smooth
your
way
for
you
my
dear
boy
you
who
have
had
neither
father
nor
mother
to
depend
on
and
now
we
have
reached
the
goal
george
things
have
looked
black
enough
for
us
sometimes
but
thank
heaven
now
you
have
nothing
to
fear
tesman
yes
it
is
really
marvellous
how
every
thing
has
turned
out
for
the
best
miss
tesman
and
the
people
who
opposed
you
who
wanted
to
bar
the
way
for
you
now
you
have
them
at
your
feet
they
have
fallen
george
your
most
dangerous
rival
his
fall
was
the
and
now
he
has
to
lie
on
the
bed
he
has
made
for
himself
poor
misguided
creature
tesman
have
you
heard
anything
of
eilert
since
i
went
away
i
mean
miss
tesman
only
that
he
is
said
to
have
published
a
new
book
tesman
what
eilert
lovborg
recently
eh
miss
tesman
yes
so
they
say
heaven
knows
whether
it
can
be
worth
anything
ah
when
your
new
book
appears
that
will
be
another
story
george
what
is
it
to
be
about
tesman
it
will
deal
with
the
domestic
industries
of
brabant
during
the
middle
ages
miss
tesman
fancy
to
be
able
to
write
on
such
a
subject
as
that
tesman
however
it
may
be
some
time
before
the
book
is
ready

all
these
collections
to

me
miss
tesman
of

not
for
hedda
george
tesman

tesman
why

splendid
condition
she
is
in
how
she
has
filled
out
on
the
journey
hedda
crossing
the
room
oh
do
be
quiet
miss
tesman
who

stopped
and

it
so
much
now
that
she
has
that
dress
on
but
i
who

see
hedda
at
the
glass
door
impatiently
oh

anything
tesman
it
must
be
the
mountain

in
the
tyrol
hedda
curtly
interrupting
i
am
exactly
as

was
when

started
tesman
so

quite
certain

you
auntie
eh
miss
tesman
she
goes
out
by
the
hall
door

accompanies
her
the
door
remains
half
open
tesman
can
be
heard
repeating
his
message
to
aunt
rina
and
his
thanks
for
the
slippers
in
the
meantime
hedda
walks
about
the
room
raising
her
arms
and
clenching
her
hands
as
if
in
desperation
then
she
flings
back
the
curtains
from
the
glass
door
and
stands
there
looking
out
presently
tesman
returns
and
closes
the
door
behind
him
tesman
picks
up
the
slippers
from
the
floor
what
are
you
looking
at
hedda
hedda
once
more
calm
and
mistress
of
herself
i
am
only
looking
at
the
leaves
they
are
so
yellow
so
withered
tesman
wraps
up
the
slippers
and
lays
them
on
the
table
well
you
see
we
are
well
into
september
now
hedda
again
restless
yes
to
think
of
it
already
in
in
september
tesman
do
you
think
aunt
julia
manner
was
strange
dear
almost
solemn
can
you
imagine
what
was
the
matter
with
her
eh
hedda
i
scarcely
know
her
you
see
is
she
not
often
like
that
tesman
no
not
as
she
was
hedda
leaving
the
glass
door
do
you
think
she
was
annoyed
about
the
bonnet
tesman
oh
scarcely
at
all
perhaps
a
little
just
at
the
moment
hedda
but
what
an
idea
to
pitch
her
bonnet
about
in
the
no
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
tesman
well
you
may
be
sure
aunt
julia
wo
do
it
again
hedda
in
any
case
i
shall
manage
to
make
my
peace
with
her
tesman
yes
my
dear
good
hedda
if
you
only
would
hedda
when
you
call
this
afternoon
you
might
invite
her
to
spend
the
evening
here
tesman
yes
that
i
will
and
there
one
thing
more
you
could
do
that
would
delight
her
heart
hedda
what
is
it
tesman
if
you
could
only
prevail
on
yourself
to
say
to
her
for
my
sake
hedda
eh
hedda
no
no
tesman
you
really
must
ask
that
of
me
i
have
told
you
so
already
i
shall
try
to
call
her
aunt
and
you
must
be
satisfied
with
that
tesman
well
well
only
i
think
now
that
you
belong
to
the
family
you
hedda
h
i
ca
in
the
least
see
why
she
goes
up
towards
the
middle
doorway
tesman
after
a
pause
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
hedda
eh
hedda
i
only
looking
at
my
old
piano
it
does
go
at
all
well
with
all
the
other
things
tesman
the
first
time
i
draw
my
salary
we
see
about
exchanging
it
hedda
no
no
no
exchanging
i
do
want
to
part
with
it
suppose
we
put
it
there
in
the
inner
room
and
then
get
another
here
in
its
place
when
it
convenient
i
mean
tesman
a
little
taken
aback
yes
of
course
we
could
do
that
hedda
takes
up
the
bouquet
from
the
piano
these
flowers
were
not
here
last
night
when
we
arrived
tesman
aunt
julia
must
have
brought
them
for
you
hedda
examining
the
bouquet
a
takes
it
out
and
reads

in
the
day
can
you
guess
whose
card
it
is

told
tesman
laughing

last
long

since
we
left

tesman
i
have

an
way
hole

regular
enough
in
his
habits
to
be
fit
for
the
post
eh
elvsted
for
the
last
two
years
his
conduct
has
been
irreproachable

hedda
i
hear
it
elvsted
perfectly
irreproachable

all
the

here
in

great
town
and
with
a
large
sum
of
money
in
his
hands
i
ca
help
being
in
mortal
fear
for
him
tesman
why
did
he
not
remain
where
he
was
with
you
and
your
husband
eh
elvsted
after
his
book
was
published

was
too
restless
and
unsettled
to
remain
with
us

aunt
julia
told
me
he
had
published
a
new
book
elvsted
yes
a
big
book
dealing
with
the
march
of
civilisation
in
broad
outline
as
it
were
it
came
out
about
a
fortnight
ago
and
since
it
has
sold
so
well
and
been
so
much
read
and
made
such
a
sensation
tesman
has
it
indeed
it
must
be
something
he
has
had
lying
by
since
his
better
days
elvsted
long
ago
you
mean
tesman
yes
elvsted
no
he
has
written

all
since

have
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
finding
out
his
address
but
this
morning
i
discovered
it
at
last
hedda
looks
searchingly
at
her
do
you
know
it
seems
to
me
a
little
odd
of
your
husband
h
elvsted
starting
nervously
of
my
husband
what
hedda
that
he
should
send
you
to
town
on
such
an
errand
that
he
does
not
come
himself
and
look
after
his
friend
elvsted
oh
no
no
my
husband
has
no
time
and
besides
i
i
had
some
shopping
to
do
hedda
with
a
slight
smile
ah
that
is
a
different
matter
elvsted
rising
quickly
and
uneasily
and
now
i
beg
and
implore
you
tesman

eilert
lovborg
kindly

he
comes
to
you
and
that
he
is
sure
to
do
you

great
friends
in
the
old
days

are
interested
in
the
same
studies
the
same
branch
of
science
so
far
as
i
can
understand
tesman
we
used
to
be
at
any
rate
elvsted
that
is

he
may
not
care
to
come
to
you
of
his

accord

be
the
right
thing

inner
room

up
to

smiles
and
says
in
a
low
voice
there
we
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
elvsted
what
do
you

hedda
could
you
not

the
letter
hedda
and
that
i
might
speak
to
you
alone
elvsted
confused
about
the
same
thing
hedda
precisely
elvsted
apprehensively
but
there
is
nothing
more
tesman
absolutely
nothing
hedda
oh
yes
but
there
is
there
is
a
great
deal
more
i
can
see
that
sit
here
and
we
have
a
cosy
confidential
chat
she
forces
elvsted
to
sit
in
the
beside
the
stove
and
seats
herself
on
one
of
the
footstools
elvsted
anxiously
looking
at
her
watch
but
my
dear
tesman
i
was
really
on
the
point
of
going
hedda
oh
you
ca
be
in
such
a
well
now
tell
me
something
about
your
life
at
home
elvsted
oh
that
is
just
what
i
care
least
to
speak
about
hedda
but
to
me
dear
why
were
we
schoolfellows
elvsted
yes
but
you
were
in
the
class
above
me
oh
how
dreadfully
afraid
of
you
i
was
then
hedda
afraid
of
me
elvsted
yes
dreadfully
for
when
we
met
on
the
stairs
you
used
always
to
pull
my
hair
hedda
did
i
really
elvsted
yes
and
once
you
said
you
would
burn
it
off
my
head
hedda
oh
that
was
all
nonsense
of
course
elvsted
yes
but
i
was
so
silly
in
those
and
since
then
too
we
have
drifted
so
far
far
apart
from
each
other
our
circles
have
been
so
entirely
different
hedda
well
then
we
must
try
to
drift
together
again
now
listen
at
school
we
said
to
each
other
and
we
called
each
other
by
our
christian
names
elvsted
no
i
am
sure
you
must
be
mistaken
hedda
no
not
at
all
i
can
remember
quite
distinctly
so
now
we
are
going
to
renew
our
old
friendship
draws
the
footstool
closer
to
mrs
elvsted
there
now
kisses
her
cheek
you
must
say
to
me
and
call
me
hedda
elvsted
presses
and
pats
her
hands
oh
how
good
and
kind
you
are
i
am
not
used
to
such
kindness
hedda
there
there
there
and
i
shall
say
to
you
as
in
the
old
days
and
call
you
my
dear
thora
elvsted
my
name
is
thea
hedda
why
of
course
i
meant
thea
looks
at
her
compassionately
so
you
are
not
accustomed
to
goodness
and
kindness
thea
not
in
your
own
home
elvsted
oh
if
i
only
had
a
home
but
i
have
any
i
have
never
had
a
home
hedda
looks
at
her
for
a
moment
i
almost
suspected
as
much
elvsted
gazing
helplessly
before
her
yes
yes
yes
hedda
i
do
quite
remember
was
it
not
as
housekeeper
that
you
first
went
to
elvsted
elvsted
i
really
went
as
governess
but
his
wife
his
late
wife
was
an
invalid
and
rarely
left
her
room
so
i
had
to
look
after
the
housekeeping
as
well
hedda
and
then
at
last
you
became
mistress
of
the
house
elvsted
sadly
yes
i
did
hedda
let
me
see
about
how
long
ago
was
that
elvsted
my
marriage
hedda
yes
elvsted
five
years
ago
hedda
to
be
sure
it
must
be
that
elvsted
oh
those
five
years
or
at
all
events
the
last
two
or
three
of
them
oh
if
you
could
only
imagine
hedda
giving
her
a
little
slap
on
the
hand
de
fie
thea
elvsted
yes
yes
i
will
try
well
if
you
could
only
imagine
and
understand
hedda
lightly
eilert
lovborg
has
been
in
your
neighbourhood
about
three
years
has
he
elvsted
looks
at
here
doubtfully
eilert
lovborg
yes
he
has
hedda
had
you
known
him
before
in
town
here
elvsted
scarcely
at
all
i
mean
i
knew
him
by
name
of
course
hedda
but
you
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
in
the
country
elvsted
yes
he
came
to
us
every
day
you
see
he
gave
the
children
lessons
for
in
the
long
run
i
could
manage
it
all
myself
hedda
no
that
and
your
husband
i
suppose
he
is
often
away
from
home
elvsted
yes
being
sheriff
you
know
he
has
to
travel
about
a
good
deal
in
his
district
hedda
leaning
against
the
arm
of
the
chair
thea
my
poor
sweet
thea
now
you
must
tell
me
everything
exactly
as
it
stands
elvsted
well
then
you
must
question
me
hedda
what
sort
of
a
man
is
your
husband
thea
i
mean
you
know
in
everyday
life
is
he
kind
to
you
elvsted
evasively
i
am
sure
he
means
well
in
everything
hedda
i
should
think
he
must
be
altogether
too
old
for
you
there
is
at
least
twenty
years
difference
between
you
is
there
not
elvsted
irritably
yes
that
is
true
too
everything
about
him
is
repellent
to
me
we
have
not
a
thought
in
common
we
have
no
single
point
of
sympathy
he
and
hedda
but
is
he
not
fond
of
you
all
the
same
in
his
own
way
elvsted
oh
i
really
do
know
i
think
he
regards
me
simply
as
a
useful
property
and
then
it
does
cost
much
to
keep
me
i
am
not
expensive
hedda
that
is
stupid
of
you
elvsted
shakes
her
head
it
can
not
be
otherwise
not
with
him
i
do
think
he
really
cares
for
any
one
but
himself
and
perhaps
a
little
for
the
children
hedda
and
for
eilert
lovborg
thea
elvsted
looking
at
her
for
eilert
lovborg
what
puts
that
into
your
head
hedda
well
my
dear
i
should
say
when
he
sends
you
after
him
all
the
way
to
town
smiling
almost
imperceptibly
and
besides
you
said
so
yourself
to
tesman
elvsted
with
a
little
nervous
twitch
did
i
yes
i
suppose
i
did
vehemently
but
not
loudly
no
i
may
just
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
at
once
for
it
must
all
come
out
in
any
case
hedda
why
my
dear
thea
elvsted
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
my
husband
did
not
know
that
i
was
coming
hedda
what
your
husband
did
know
it
elvsted
no
of
course
not
for
that
matter
he
was
away
from
home
himself
he
was
travelling
oh
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
hedda
i
indeed
so
utterly
alone
as
i
should
have
been
in
future
hedda
well
and
then
elvsted
so
i
put
together
some
of
my
things
what
i
needed
most
as
quietly
as
possible
and
then
i
left
the
house
hedda
without
a
word
elvsted
yes
and
took
the
train
to
town
hedda
why
my
dear
good
thea
to
think
of
you
daring
to
do
it
elvsted
rises
and
moves
about
the
room
what
else
could
i
possibly
do
hedda
but
what
do
you
think
your
husband
will
say
when
you
go
home
again
elvsted
at
the
table
looks
at
her
back
to
him
hedda
of
course
elvsted
i
shall
never
go
back
to
him
again
hedda
rising
and
going
towards
her
then
you
have
left
your
home
for
good
and
all
elvsted
yes
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
hedda
but
then
to
take
flight
so
openly
elvsted
oh
it
impossible
to
keep
things
of
that
sort
secret
hedda
but
what
do
you
think
people
will
say
of
you
thea
elvsted
they
may
say
what
they
like
for
aught
care
seats
herself
wearily
and
sadly
on
the
sofa
i
have
done
nothing
but
what
i
had
to
do
hedda
after
a
short
silence
and
what
are
your
plans
now
what
do
you
think
of
doing
elvsted
i
do
know
yet
i
only
know
this
that
i
must
live
here
where
eilert
lovborg
is
if
i
am
to
live
at
all
hedda
takes
a
chair
from
the
table
seats
herself
beside
her
and
strokes
her
hands
my
dear
thea
how
did
this
this
friendship
between
you
and
eilert
lovborg
come
about
elvsted
oh
it
grew
up
gradually
i
gained
a
sort
of
influence
over
him
hedda
indeed
elvsted
he
gave
up
his
old
habits
not
because
i
asked
him
to
for
i
never
dared
do
that
but
of
course
he
saw
how
repulsive
they
were
to
me
and
so
he
dropped
them
hedda
concealing
an
involuntary
smile
of
scorn
then
you
have
reclaimed
him
as
the
saying
goes
my
little
thea
elvsted
so
he
says
himself
at
any
rate
and
he
on
his
side
has
made
a
real
human
being
of
me
taught
me
to
think
and
to
understand
so
many
things
hedda
did
he
give
you
lessons
too
then
elvsted
no
not
exactly
lessons
but
he
talked
to
me
talked
about
such
an
infinity
of
things
and
then
came
the
lovely
happy
time
when
i
began
to
share
in
his
work
when
he
allowed
me
to
help
him
hedda
oh
he
did
did
he
elvsted
yes
he
never
wrote
anything
without
my
assistance
hedda
you
were
two
good
comrades
in
fact
elvsted
eagerly
comrades
yes
fancy
hedda
that
is
the
very
word
he
used
oh
i
ought
to
feel
perfectly
happy
and
yet
i
can
not
for
i
do
know
how
long
it
will
last
hedda
are
you
no
surer
of
him
than
that
elvsted
gloomily
a
woman
shadow
stands
between
eilert
lovborg
and
me
hedda
looks
at
her
anxiously
who
can
that
be
elvsted
i
do
know
some
one
he
knew
in
his
in
his
past
some
one
he
has
never
been
able
wholly
to
forget
hedda
what
has
he
told
you
about
this
elvsted
he
has
only
once
quite
vaguely
alluded
to
it
hedda
well
and
what
did
he
say
elvsted
he
said
that
when
they
parted
she
threatened
to
shoot
him
with
a
pistol
hedda
with
cold
composure
oh
nonsense
no
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
here
elvsted
no
and
that
is
why
i
think
it
must
have
been
that
whom
he
once
hedda
yes
very
likely
elvsted
for
i
remember
they
used
to
say
of
her
that
she
carried
loaded
firearms
hedda
oh
then
of
course
it
must
have
been
she
elvsted
wringing
her
hands
and
now
just
fancy
hedda
i
hear
that
this
that
she
is
in
town
again
oh
i
do
know
what
to
do
hedda
glancing
towards
the
inner
room
hush
here
comes
tesman
rises
and
whispers
thea
all
this
must
remain
between
you
and
me
elvsted
springing
up
oh
yes
yes
for
heaven
sake
george
tesman

salutations
elvsted

out
by
the

your

tolerably
satisfied
tesman
yes
we
ca
thank
you
sufficiently
of
course
she
talks
of
a
little
here
and
there
and
one
or
two
things
are
still
wanting
we
shall
have
to
buy
some
additional
trifles
brack
indeed
tesman
but
we
wo
trouble
you
about
these
things
hedda
say
she
herself
will
look
after
what
is
sha
we
sit
down
eh
brack
thanks
for
a
moment
seats
himself
beside
the
table
there
is
something
i
wanted
to
speak
to
about
my
dear
tesman
tesman
indeed
ah
i
understand
seating
himself
i
suppose
it
the
serious
part
of
the
frolic
that
is
coming
now
eh
brack
oh
the
money
question
is
not
so
very
pressing
though
for
that
matter
i
wish
we
had
gone
a
little
more
economically
to
work
tesman
but
that
would
never
have
done
you
know
think
of
hedda
my
dear
fellow
you
who
know
her
so
well
i
could
possibly
ask
her
to
put
up
with
a
shabby
style
of
living
brack
no
no
that
is
just
the
difficulty
tesman
and
then
fortunately
it
ca
be
long
before
i
receive
my
appointment
brack
well
you
see
such
things
are
often
apt
to
hang
fire
for
a
long
time
tesman
have
you
heard
anything
definite
eh
brack
nothing
exactly
definite
interrupting
himself
but
i
have
one
piece
of
news
for
you
tesman
well
brack
your
old
friend
eilert
lovborg
has
returned
to
town
tesman
i
know
that
already
brack
indeed
how
did
you
learn
it
tesman
from
that
lady
who
went
out
with
hedda
brack
really
what
was
her
name
i
did
quite
catch
it
tesman
elvsted
brack
aha
sheriff
elvsted
wife
of
course
he
has
been
living
up
in
their
regions
tesman
and
fancy
i
delighted
to
hear
that
he
is
quite
a
reformed
character
brack
so
they
say
tesman
and
then
he
has
published
a
new
book
eh
brack
yes
indeed
he
has
tesman
and
i
hear
it
has
made
some
sensation
brack
quite
an
unusual
sensation
tesman
fancy
is
that
good
news
a
man
of
such
extraordinary
talents
i
felt
so
grieved
to
think
that
he
had
gone
irretrievably
to
ruin
brack
that
was
what
everybody
thought
tesman
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
he
will
take
to
now
how
in
the
world
will
he
be
able
to
make
his
living
eh
during
the
last
words
hedda
has
entered
by
the
hall
door
hedda
to
brack
laughing
with
a
touch
of
scorn
tesman
is
for
ever
worrying
about
how
people
are
to
make
their
living
tesman
well
you
see
dear
we
were
talking
about
poor
eilert
lovborg
hedda
glancing
at
him
rapidly
oh
indeed
sets
herself
in
the
beside
the
stove
and
asks
indifferently
what
is
the
matter
with
him
tesman
well
no
doubt
he
has
run
through
all
his
property
long
ago
and
he
can
scarcely
write
a
new
book
every
year
eh
so
i
really
ca
see
what
is
to
become
of
him
brack
perhaps
i
can
give
you
some
information
on
that
point
tesman
indeed
brack
you
must
remember
that
his
relations
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
tesman
oh
his
relations
unfortunately
have
entirely
washed
their
hands
of
him
brack
at
one
time
they
called
him
the
hope
of
the
family
tesman
at
one
time
yes
but
he
has
put
an
end
to
all
that
hedda
who
knows
with
a
slight
smile
i
hear
they
have
reclaimed
him
up
at
sheriff
elvsted
brack
and
then
this
book
that
he
has
published
tesman
well
well
i
hope
to
goodness
they
may
find
something
for
him
to
do
i
have
just
written
to
him
i
asked
him
to
come
and
see
us
this
evening
hedda
dear
brack
but
my
dear
fellow
you
are
booked
for
my
bachelor
party
this
evening
you
promised
on
the
pier
last
night
hedda
had
you
forgotten
tesman
tesman
yes
i
had
utterly
forgotten
brack
but
it
does
matter
for
you
may
be
sure
he
wo
come
tesman
what
makes
you
think
that
eh
brack
with
a
little
hesitation
rising
and
resting
his
hands
on
the
back
of
his
chair
my
dear
tesman
and
you
too
tesman
i
think
i
ought
not
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
about
something
that
that
tesman
that
concerns
eilert
brack
both
you
and
him
tesman
well
my
dear
judge
out
with
it
brack
you
must
be
prepared
to
find
your
appointment
deferred
longer
than
you
desired
or
expected
tesman
jumping
up
uneasily
is
there
some
hitch
about
it
eh
brack
the
nomination
may
perhaps
be
made
conditional
on
the
result
of
a
competition
tesman
competition
think
of
that
hedda
hedda
leans
further
back
in
the
chair
aha
aha
tesman
but
who
can
my
competitor
be
surely
not
brack
yes
precisely
eilert
lovborg
tesman
clasping
his
hands
no
no
it
quite
impossible
eh
brack
h
that
is
what
it
may
come
to
all
the
same
tesman
well
but
judge
brack
it
would
show
the
most
incredible
lack
of
consideration
for
me
gesticulates
with
his
arms
for
just
think
a
married
man
we
have
married
on
the
strength
of
these
prospects
hedda
and
i
and
run
deep
into
debt
and
borrowed
money
from
aunt
julia
too
good
heavens
they
had
as
good
as
promised
me
the
appointment
eh
brack
well
well
well
no
doubt
you
will
get
it
in
the
end
only
after
a
contest
hedda
immovable
in
her
fancy
tesman
there
will
be
a
sort
of
sporting
interest
in
that
tesman
why
my
dearest
hedda
how
can
you
be
so
indifferent
about
it
hedda
as
before
i
am
not
at
all
indifferent
i
am
most
eager
to
see
who
wins
brack
in
any
case
tesman
it
is
best
that
you
should
know
how
matters
stand
i
mean
before
you
set
about
the
little
purchases
i
hear
you
are
threatening
hedda
this
can
make
no
difference
brack
indeed
then
i
have
no
more
to
say
to
tesman
i
shall
look
in
on
my
way
back
from
my
afternoon
walk
and
take
you
home
with
me
tesman
oh
yes
yes
your
news
has
quite
upset
me
hedda
reclining
holds
out
her
hand
judge
and
be
sure
you
call
in
the
afternoon
brack
many
thanks
tesman
accompanying
him
to
the
door
my
dear
judge
you
must
really
excuse
me
judge
brack
goes
out
by
the
hall
door
tesman
crosses
the
room
oh
hedda
one
should
never
rush
into
adventures
eh
hedda
looks
at
him
smiling
do
you
do
that
tesman
yes
dear
there
is
no
denying
it
was
adventurous
to
go
and
marry
and
set
up
house
upon
mere
expectations
hedda
perhaps
you
are
right
there
tesman
well
at
all
events
we
have
our
delightful
home
hedda
fancy
the
home
we
both
dreamed
of
the
home
we
were
in
love
with
i
may
almost
say
eh
hedda
rising
slowly
and
wearily
it
was
part
of
our
compact
that
we
were
to
go
into
society
to
keep
open
house
tesman
yes
if
you
only
knew
how
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
fancy
to
see
you
as
hostess
in
a
select
circle
eh
well
well
well
for
the
present
we
shall
have
to
get
on
without
society
hedda
only
to
invite
aunt
julia
now
and
oh
i
intended
you
to
lead
such
an
utterly
different
life
dear
hedda
of
course
i
can
not
have
my
man
in
livery
just
yet
tesman
oh
no
unfortunately
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
for
us
to
keep
a
footman
you
know
hedda
and
the
i
was
to
have
had
tesman
aghast
the
hedda
i
suppose
i
must
not
think
of
that
now
tesman
good
heavens
no
that
as
clear
as
daylight
hedda
goes
up
the
room
well
i
shall
have
one
thing
at
least
to
kill
time
with
in
the
meanwhile
tesman
beaming
oh
thank
heaven
for
that
what
is
it
hedda
eh

she

because
if

had
thought
of
it
i

have
found

you
for
i
have
been
in
my
room
changing
my
dress
ever
since
lunch
brack
and

sort
of
little
chink
that
we
could
hold
a
parley
through
hedda
you
have
forgotten
to
arrange
one
brack
that
was
another
piece
of
stupidity
hedda
well
we
must
just
settle
down
here
and
wait
tesman
is
not
likely
to
be
back
for
some
time
yet
brack
never
mind
i
shall
not
be
impatient
hedda
seats
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
brack
lays
his
overcoat
over
the
back
of
the
nearest
chair
and
sits
down
but
keeps
his
hat
in
his
hand
a
short
silence
they
look
at
each
other
hedda
well
brack
in
the
same
tone
well
hedda
i
spoke
first
brack
bending
a
little
forward
come
let
us
have
a
cosy
little
chat
mrs
hedda
hedda
leaning
further
back
in
the
sofa
does
it
not
seem
like
a
whole
eternity
since
our
last
talk
of
course
i
do
count
those
few
words
yesterday
evening
and
this
morning
brack
you
mean
since
out
last
confidential
talk
our
last
hedda
well
yes
since
you
put
it
so
brack
not
a
day
passed
but
i
have
wished
that
you
were
home
again
hedda
and
i
have
done
nothing
but
wish
the
same
thing
brack
you
really
hedda
and
i
thought
you
had
been
enjoying
your
tour
so
much
hedda
oh
yes
you
may
be
sure
of
that
brack
but
tesman
letters
spoke
of
nothing
but
happiness
hedda
oh
tesman
you
see
he
thinks
nothing
is
so
delightful
as
grubbing
in
libraries
and
making
copies
of
old
parchments
or
whatever
you
call
them
brack
with
a
smile
of
malice
well
that
is
his
vocation
in
life
or
part
of
it
at
any
rate
hedda
yes
of
course
and
no
doubt
when
it
your
vocation
but
oh
my
dear
brack
how
mortally
bored
i
have
been
brack
sympathetically
do
you
really
say
so
in
downright
earnest
hedda
yes
you
can
surely
understand
it
to
go
for
six
whole
months
without
meeting
a
soul
that
knew
anything
of
our
circle
or
could
talk
about
things
we
were
interested
in
brack
yes
yes
i
too
should
feel
that
a
deprivation
hedda
and
then
what
i
found
most
intolerable
of
all
brack
well
hedda
was
being
everlastingly
in
the
company
of
one
and
the
same
person
brack
with
a
nod
of
assent
morning
noon
and
night
yes
at
all
possible
times
and
seasons
hedda
i
said
everlastingly
brack
just
so
but
i
should
have
thought
with
our
excellent
tesman
one
could
hedda
tesman
is
a
specialist
my
dear
judge
brack
undeniable
hedda
and
specialists
are
not
at
all
amusing
to
travel
with
not
in
the
long
run
at
any
rate
brack
not
even
the
specialist
one
happens
to
love
hedda
faugh
do
use
that
sickening
word
brack
taken
aback
what
do
you
say
hedda
hedda
half
laughing
half
irritated
you
should
just
try
it
to
hear
of
nothing
but
the
history
of
civilisation
morning
noon
and
night
brack
everlastingly
hedda
yes
yes
yes
and
then
all
this
about
the
domestic
industry
of
the
middle
ages
that
the
most
disgusting
part
of
it
brack
looks
searchingly
at
her
but
tell
me
in
that
case
how
am
i
to
understand
your
h
hedda
my
accepting
george
tesman
you
mean
brack
well
let
us
put
it
so
hedda
good
heavens
do
you
see
anything
so
wonderful
in
that
brack
yes
and
no
hedda
hedda
i
had
positively
danced
myself
tired
my
dear
judge
my
day
was
done
with
a
slight
shudder
oh
no
i
wo
say
that
nor
think
it
either
brack
you
have
assuredly
no
reason
to
hedda
oh
reasons
watching
him
closely
and
george
tesman
after
all
you
must
admit
that
he
is
correctness
itself
brack
his
correctness
and
respectability
are
beyond
all
question
hedda
and
i
do
see
anything
absolutely
ridiculous
about
do
you
brack
ridiculous
n
no
i
should
exactly
say
so
hedda
well
and
his
powers
of
research
at
all
events
are
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
one
day
come
to
the
front
after
all
brack
looks
at
her
hesitatingly
i
thought
that
you
like
every
one
else
expected
him
to
attain
the
highest
distinction
hedda
with
an
expression
of
fatigue
yes
so
i
and
then
since
he
was
bent
at
all
hazards
on
being
allowed
to
provide
for
me
i
really
know
why
i
should
not
have
accepted
his
offer
brack
no
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
hedda
it
was
more
than
my
other
adorers
were
prepared
to
do
for
me
my
dear
judge
brack
laughing
well
i
ca
answer
for
all
the
rest
but
as
for
myself
you
know
quite
well
that
i
have
always
entertained
a
a
certain
respect
for
the
marriage
tie
for
marriage
as
an
institution
hedda
hedda
jestingly
oh
i
assure
you
i
have
never
cherished
any
hopes
with
respect
to
you
brack
all
i
require
is
a
pleasant
and
intimate
interior
where
i
can
make
myself
useful
in
every
way
and
am
free
to
come
and
go
as
as
a
trusted
friend
hedda
of
the
master
of
the
house
do
you
mean
brack
bowing
frankly
of
the
mistress
first
of
all
but
of
course
of
the
master
too
in
the
second
place
such
a
triangular
friendship
if
i
may
call
it
so
is
really
a
great
convenience
for
all
the
parties
let
me
tell
you
hedda
yes
i
have
many
a
time
longed
for
some
one
to
make
a
third
on
our
travels
oh
those
brack
fortunately
your
wedding
journey
is
over
now
hedda
shaking
her
head
not
by
a
long
long
way
i
have
only
arrived
at
a
station
on
the
line
brack
well
then
the
passengers
jump
out
and
move
about
a
little
hedda
hedda
i
never
jump
out
brack
really
hedda
no
because
there
is
always
some
one
standing
by
to
brack
laughing
to
look
at
your
ankles
do
you
mean
hedda
precisely
brack
well
but
dear
me
hedda
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
i
wo
have
it
i
would
rather
keep
my
seat
where
i
happen
to
be
and
continue
the
brack
but
suppose
a
third
person
were
to
jump
in
and
join
the
couple
hedda
ah
that
is
quite
another
matter
brack
a
trusted
sympathetic
friend
hedda
with
a
fund
of
conversation
on
all
sorts
of
lively
topics
brack
and
not
the
least
bit
of
a
specialist
hedda
with
an
audible
sigh
yes
that
would
be
a
relief
indeed
brack
hears
the
front
door
open
and
glances
in
that
direction
the
triangle
is
completed
hedda
half
aloud
and
on
goes
the
train
george
tesman
in
a
grey
with
a
soft
felt
hat
enters
from
the
hall
he
has
a
number
of
unbound
books
under
his
arm
and
in
his
pockets
tesman
goes
up
to
the
table
beside
the
corner
settee
ouf
what
a
load
for
a
warm
day
all
these
books
lays
them
on
the
table
i
positively
perspiring
hedda
hallo
are
you
there
already
my
dear
judge
eh
berta
did
tell
me
brack
rising
i
came
in
through
the
garden
hedda
what
books
have
you
got
there
tesman
stands
looking
them
through
some
new
books
on
my
special
subjects
quite
indispensable
to
me
hedda
your
special
subjects
brack
yes
books
on
his
special
subjects
tesman
brack
and
hedda
exchange
a
confidential
smile
hedda
do
you
need
still
more
books
on
your
special
subjects
tesman
yes
my
dear
hedda
one
can
never
have
too
many
of
them
of
course
one
must
keep
up
with
all
that
is
written
and
published
hedda
yes
i
suppose
one
must
tesman
searching
among
his
books
and
look
here
i
have
got
hold
of
eilert
lovborg
new
book
too
offering
it
to
her
perhaps
you
would
like
to
glance
through
it
hedda
eh
hedda
no
thank
you
or
rather
afterwards
perhaps
tesman
i
looked
into
it
a
little
on
the
way
home
brack
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
as
a
specialist
tesman
i
think
it
shows
quite
remarkable
soundness
of
judgment
he
never
wrote
like
that
before
putting
the
books
together
now
i
shall
take
all
these
into
my
study
i
longing
to
cut
the
leaves
and
then
i
must
change
my
clothes
to
brack
i
suppose
we
need
start
just
yet
eh
brack
oh
dear
no
there
is
not
the
slightest
hurry
tesman
well
then
i
will
take
my
time
is
going
with
his
books
but
stops
in
the
doorway
and
turns
hedda
aunt
julia
is
not
coming
this
evening
hedda
not
coming
is
it
that
affair
of
the
bonnet
that
keeps
her
away
tesman
oh
not
at
all
how
could
you
think
such
a
thing
of
aunt
julia
just
fancy
the
fact
is
aunt
rina
is
very
hedda
she
always
is
tesman
yes
but
she
is
much
worse
than
usual
poor
dear
hedda
oh
then
it
only
natural
that
her
sister
should
remain
with
her
i
must
bear
my
disappointment
tesman
and
you
ca
imagine
dear
how
delighted
aunt
julia
seemed
to
be
because
you
had
come
home
looking
so
flourishing
hedda
half
aloud
rising
oh
those
everlasting
aunts
tesman
what
hedda
going
to
the
glass
door
nothing
tesman
oh
all
right
he
goes
through
the
inner
room
out
to
the
right
brack
what
bonnet
were
you
talking
about
hedda
oh
it
was
a
little
episode
with
miss
tesman
this
morning
she
had
laid
down
her
bonnet
on
the
chair
there
looks
at
him
and
smiles
and
i
pretended
to
think
it
was
the
servant
brack
shaking
his
head
now
my
dear
hedda
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
to
the
excellent
old
lady
too
hedda
nervously
crossing
the
room
well
you
see
these
impulses
come
over
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
i
can
not
resist
them
throws
herself
down
in
the
by
the
stove
oh
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
brack
behind
the
you
are
not
really
happy
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
hedda
looking
straight
before
her
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
be
happy
perhaps
you
can
give
me
one
brack
other
things
because
you
have
got
exactly
the
home
you
had
set
your
heart
on
hedda
looks
up
at
him
and
laughs
do
you
too
believe
in
that
legend
brack
is
there
nothing
in
it
then
hedda
oh
yes
there
is
something
in
it
brack
well
hedda
there
is
this
in
it
that
i
made
use
of
tesman
to
see
me
home
from
evening
parties
last
summer
brack
i
unfortunately
had
to
go
quite
a
different
way
hedda
that
true
i
know
you
were
going
a
different
way
last
summer
brack
laughing
oh
fie
hedda
well
then
you
and
tesman
hedda
well
we
happened
to
pass
here
one
evening
tesman
poor
fellow
was
writhing
in
the
agony
of
having
to
find
conversation
so
i
took
pity
on
the
learned
man
brack
smiles
doubtfully
you
took
pity
h
hedda
yes
i
really
did
and
so
to
help
him
out
of
his
torment
i
happened
to
say
in
pure
thoughtlessness
that
i
should
like
to
live
in
this
villa
brack
no
more
than
that
hedda
not
that
evening
brack
but
afterwards
hedda
yes
my
thoughtlessness
had
consequences
my
dear
judge
brack
unfortunately
that
too
often
happens
hedda
hedda
thanks
so
you
see
it
was
this
enthusiasm
for
secretary
falk
villa
that
first
constituted
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
george
tesman
and
me
from
that
came
our
engagement
and
our
marriage
and
our
wedding
journey
and
all
the
rest
of
it
well
well
my
dear
judge
as
you
make
your
bed
so
you
must
lie
i
could
almost
say
brack
this
is
exquisite
and
you
really
cared
not
a
rap
about
it
all
the
time
hedda
no
heaven
knows
i
did
brack
but
now
now
that
we
have
made
it
so
homelike
for
you
hedda
uh
the
rooms
all
seem
to
smell
of
lavender
and
dried
but
perhaps
it
aunt
julia
that
has
brought
that
scent
with
her
brack
laughing
no
i
think
it
must
be
a
legacy
from
the
late
secretary
falk
hedda
yes
there
is
an
odour
of
mortality
about
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
bouquet
the
day
after
the
ball
clasps
her
hands
behind
her
head
leans
back
in
her
chair
and
looks
at
him
oh
my
dear
judge
you
can
not
imagine
how
horribly
i
shall
bore
myself
here
brack
why
should
not
you
too
find
some
sort
of
vocation
in
life
hedda
hedda
a
vocation
that
should
attract
me
brack
if
possible
of
course
hedda
heaven
knows
what
sort
of
a
vocation
that
could
be
i
often
wonder
whether
breaking
off
but
that
would
never
do
either
brack
who
can
tell
let
me
hear
what
it
is
hedda
whether
i
might
not
get
tesman
to
go
into
politics
i
mean
brack
laughing
tesman
no
really
now
political
life
is
not
the
thing
for
him
not
at
all
in
his
line
hedda
no
i
daresay
but
if
i
could
get
him
into
it
all
the
same
brack
why
what
satisfaction
could
you
find
in
that
if
he
is
not
fitted
for
that
sort
of
thing
why
should
you
want
to
drive
him
into
it
hedda
because
i
am
bored
i
tell
you
after
a
pause
so
you
think
it
quite
out
of
the
question
that
tesman
should
ever
get
into
the
ministry
brack
h
you
see
my
dear
hedda
to
get
into
the
ministry
he
would
have
to
be
a
tolerably
rich
man
hedda
rising
impatiently
yes
there
we
have
it
it
is
this
genteel
poverty
i
have
managed
to
drop
into
crosses
the
room
that
is
what
makes
life
so
pitiable
so
utterly
ludicrous
for
that
what
it
is
brack
now
should
say
the
fault
lay
elsewhere
hedda
where
then
brack
you
have
never
gone
through
any
really
stimulating
experience
hedda
anything
serious
you
mean
brack
yes
you
may
call
it
so
but
now
you
may
perhaps
have
one
in
store
hedda
tossing
her
head
oh
you
thinking
of
the
annoyances
about
this
wretched
professorship
but
that
must
be
tesman
own
affair
i
assure
you
i
shall
not
waste
a
thought
upon
it
brack
no
no
i
daresay
not
but
suppose
now
that
what
people
call
in
elegant
language
a
solemn
responsibility
were
to
come
upon
you
smiling
a
new
responsibility
hedda
hedda
angrily
be
quiet
nothing
of
that
sort
will
ever
happen
brack
warily
we
will
speak
of
this
again
a
year
hence
at
the
very
outside
hedda
curtly
i
have
no
turn
for
anything
of
the
sort
judge
brack
no
responsibilities
for
me
brack
are
you
so
unlike
the
generality
of
women
as
to
have
no
turn
for
duties
which
hedda
beside
the
glass
door
oh
be
quiet
i
tell
you
i
often
think
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
i
have
any
turn
for
brack
drawing
near
to
her
and
what
is
that
if
i
may
ask
hedda
stands
looking
out
boring
myself
to
death
now
you
know
it
turns
looks
towards
the
inner
room
and
laughs
yes
as
i
thought
here
comes
the
professor
brack
softly
in
a
tone
of
warning
come
come
come
hedda
george
tesman
dressed
for
the
party
with
his
gloves
and
hat
in
his
hand
enters
from
the
right
through
the
inner
room
tesman
hedda
has
no
message
come
from
eilert
lovborg
eh
hedda
no
tesman
then
you
see
he
be
here
presently
brack
do
you
really
think
he
will
come
tesman
yes
i
am
almost
sure
of
it
for
what
you
were
telling
us
this
morning
must
have
been
a
mere
floating
rumour
brack
you
think
so
tesman
at
any
rate
aunt
julia
said
she
did
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
would
ever
stand
in
my
way
again
fancy
that
brack
well
then
that
all
right
tesman
placing
his
hat
and
gloves
on
a
chair
on
the
right
yes
but
you
must
really
let
me
wait
for
him
as
long
as
possible
brack
we
have
plenty
of
time
yet
none
of
my
guests
will
arrive
before
seven
or
tesman
then
meanwhile
we
can
keep
hedda
company
and
see
what
happens
eh
hedda
placing
brack
hat
and
overcoat
upon
the
corner
settee
and
at
the
worst
lovborg
can
remain
here
with
me
brack
offering
to
take
his
things
oh
allow
me
mrs
tesman
what
do
you
mean
by
at
the
worst
hedda
if
he
wo
go
with
you
and
tesman
tesman
looks
dubiously
at
her
but
hedda
dear
do
you
think
it
would
quite
do
for
him
to
remain
here
with
you
eh
remember
aunt
julia
ca
come
hedda
no
but
elvsted
is
coming
we
three
can
have
a
cup
of
tea
together
tesman
oh
yes
that
will
be
all
right
brack
smiling
and
that
would
perhaps
be
the
safest
plan
for
him
hedda
why
so
brack
well
you
know
tesman
how
you
used
to
gird
at
my
little
bachelor
parties
you
declared
they
were
adapted
only
for
men
of
the
strictest
principles
hedda
but
no
doubt
lovborg
principles
are
strict
enough
now
a
converted
sinner
berta
appears
at
the
hall
door
berta
there
a
gentleman
asking
if
you
are
at
home
hedda
well
show
him
in
tesman
softly
i
sure
it
is
he
fancy
that
eilert
lovborg
enters
from
the
hall
he
is
slim
and
lean
of
the
same
age
as
tesman
but
looks
older
and
somewhat
his
hair
and
beard
are
of
a
blackish
brown
his
face
long
and
pale
but
with
patches
of
colour
on
the
cheeks
he
is
dressed
in
a
black
visiting
suit
quite
new
he
has
dark
gloves
and
a
silk
hat
he
stops
near
the
door
and
makes
a
rapid
bow
seeming
somewhat
embarrassed
tesman
goes
up
to
him
and
shakes
him
warmly
by
the
hand
well
my
dear
eilert
so
at
last
we
meet
again
eilert
lovborg
speaks
in
a
subdued
voice
thanks
for
your
letter
tesman
approaching
hedda
will
you
too
shake
hands
with
me
tesman
hedda
taking
his
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
you
lovborg
with
a
motion
of
her
hand
i
do
know
whether
you
two
gentlemen
lovborg
bowing
slightly
judge
brack
i
think
brack
doing
likewise
oh
yes
in
the
old
days
tesman
to
lovborg
with
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
now
you
must
make
yourself
entirely
at
home
eilert
must
he
hedda
for
i
hear
you
are
going
to
settle
in
town
again
eh
lovborg
yes
i
am
tesman
quite
right
quite
right
let
me
tell
you
i
have
got
hold
of
your
new
book
but
i
have
had
time
to
read
it
yet
lovborg
you
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
tesman
why
so
lovborg
because
there
is
very
little
in
it
tesman
just
fancy
how
can
you
say
so
brack
but
it
has
been
very
much
praised
i
hear
lovborg
that
was
what
i
wanted
so
i
put
nothing
into
the
book
but
what
every
one
would
agree
with
brack
very
wise
of
you
tesman
well
but
my
dear
eilert
lovborg
for
now
i
mean
to
win
myself
a
position
again
to
make
a
fresh
start
tesman
a
little
embarrassed
ah
that
is
what
you
wish
to
do
eh
lovborg
smiling
lays
down
his
hat
and
draws
a
packet
wrapped
in
paper
from
his
coat
pocket
but
when
this
one
appears
george
tesman
you
will
have
to
read
it
for
this
is
the
real
book
the
book
i
have
put
my
true
self
into
tesman
indeed
and
what
is
it
lovborg
it
is
the
continuation
tesman
the
continuation
of
what
lovborg
of
the
book
tesman
of
the
new
book
lovborg
of
course
tesman
why
my
dear
eilert
does
it
not
come
down
to
our
own
days
lovborg
yes
it
does
and
this
one
deals
with
the
future
tesman
with
the
future
but
good
heavens
we
know
nothing
of
the
future
lovborg
no
but
there
is
a
thing
or
two
to
be
said
about
it
all
the
same
opens
the
packet
look
here
tesman
why
that
not
your
handwriting
lovborg
i
dictated
it
turning
over
the
pages
it
falls
into
two
sections
the
first
deals
with
the
civilising
forces
of
the
future
and
here
is
the
second
running
through
the
pages
towards
the
end
forecasting
the
probable
line
of
development
tesman
how
odd
now
i
should
never
have
thought
of
writing
anything
of
that
sort
hedda
at
the
glass
door
drumming
on
the
pane
h
i
daresay
not
lovborg
replacing
the
manuscript
in
its
paper
and
laying
the
packet
on
the
table
i
brought
it
thinking
i
might
read
you
a
little
of
it
this
evening
tesman
that
was
very
good
of
you
eilert
but
this
evening
looking
back
at
brack
i
do
see
how
we
can
manage
it
lovborg
well
then
some
other
time
there
is
no
hurry
brack
i
must
tell
you
lovborg
there
is
a
little
gathering
at
my
house
this
evening
mainly
in
honour
of
tesman
you
know
lovborg
looking
for
his
hat
oh
then
i
wo
detain
you
brack
no
but
listen
will
you
not
do
me
the
favour
of
joining
us
lovborg
curtly
and
decidedly
no
i
ca
thank
you
very
much
brack
oh
nonsense
do
we
shall
be
quite
a
select
little
circle
and
i
assure
you
we
shall
have
a
lively
time
as
hed
as
tesman
says
lovborg
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
nevertheless
brack
and
then
you
might
bring
your
manuscript
with
you
and
read
it
to
tesman
at
my
house
i
could
give
you
a
room
to
yourselves
tesman
yes
think
of
that
eilert
why
should
you
eh
hedda
interposing
but
tesman
if
lovborg
would
really
rather
not
i
am
sure
lovborg
is
much
more
inclined
to
remain
here
and
have
supper
with
me
lovborg
looking
at
her
with
you
tesman
hedda
and
with
elvsted
lovborg
ah
lightly
i
saw
her
for
a
moment
this
morning
hedda
did
you
well
she
is
coming
this
evening
so
you
see
you
are
almost
bound
to
remain
lovborg
or
she
will
have
no
one
to
see
her
home
lovborg
that
true
many
thanks
tesman
in
that
case
i
will
remain
hedda
then
i
have
one
or
two
orders
to
give
the
servant
she
goes
to
the
hall
door
and
rings
berta
enters
hedda
talks
to
her
in
a
whisper
and
points
towards
the
inner
room
berta
nods
and
goes
out
again
tesman
at
the
same
time
to
lovborg
tell
me
eilert
is
it
this
new
subject
the
future
that
you
are
going
to
lecture
about
lovborg
yes
tesman
they
told
me
at
the
bookseller
that
you
are
going
to
deliver
a
course
of
lectures
this
autumn
lovborg
that
is
my
intention
i
hope
you
wo
take
it
ill
tesman
tesman
oh
no
not
in
the
least
but
lovborg
i
can
quite
understand
that
it
must
be
very
disagreeable
to
you
tesman
cast
down
oh
i
ca
expect
you
out
of
consideration
for
me
to
lovborg
but
i
shall
wait
till
you
have
received
your
appointment
tesman
will
you
wait
yes
but
yes
but
are
you
not
going
to
compete
with
me
eh
lovborg
no
it
is
only
the
moral
victory
i
care
for
tesman
why
bless
me
then
aunt
julia
was
right
after
all
oh
yes
i
knew
it
hedda
just
fancy
eilert
lovborg
is
not
going
to
stand
in
our
way
hedda
curtly
our
way
pray
leave
me
out
of
the
question
she
goes
up
towards
the
inner
room
where
berta
is
placing
a
tray
with
decanters
and
glasses
on
the
table
hedda
nods
approval
and
comes
forward
again
berta
goes
out
tesman
at
the
same
time
and
you
judge
brack
what
do
you
say
to
this
eh
brack
well
i
say
that
a
moral
victory
h
may
be
all
very
fine
tesman
yes
certainly
but
all
the
same
hedda
looking
at
tesman
with
a
cold
smile
you
stand
there
looking
as
if
you
were
thunderstruck
tesman
yes
so
i
am
i
almost
think
brack
do
you
see
tesman
a
thunderstorm
has
just
passed
over
hedda
pointing
towards
the
room
will
you
not
take
a
glass
of
cold
punch
gentlemen
brack
looking
at
his
watch
a
yes
it
would
come
amiss
tesman
a
capital
idea
hedda
just
the
thing
now
that
the
weight
has
been
taken
off
my
mind
hedda
will
you
not
join
them
lovborg
lovborg
with
a
gesture
of
refusal
no
thank
you
nothing
for
me
brack
why
bless
me
cold
punch
is
surely
not
poison
lovborg
perhaps
not
for
everyone
hedda
i
will
keep
lovborg
company
in
the
meantime
tesman
yes
yes
hedda
dear
do
he
and
brack
go
into
the
inner
room
seat
themselves
drink
punch
smoke
cigarettes
and
carry
on
a
lively
conversation
during
what
follows
eilert
lovborg
remains
standing
beside
the
stove
hedda
goes
to
the
hedda
raising
he
voice
a
little
do
you
care
to
look
at
some
photographs
lovborg
you
know
tesman
and
i
made
a
tour
in
the
tyrol
on
our
way
home
she
takes
up
an
album
and
places
it
on
the
table
beside
the
sofa
in
the
further
corner
of
which
she
seats
herself
eilert
lovborg
approaches
stops
and
looks
at
her
then
he
takes
a
chair
and
seats
himself
to
her
left
hedda
opening
the
album
do
you
see
this
range
of
mountains
lovborg
it
the
ortler
group
tesman
has
written
the
name
underneath
here
it
is
the
ortler
group
near
meran
lovborg
who
has
never
taken
his
eyes
off
her
says
softly
and
slowly
hedda
gabler
hedda
glancing
hastily
at
him
ah
hush
lovborg
repeats
softly
hedda
gabler
hedda
looking
at
the
album
that
was
my
name
in
the
old
days
when
we
two
knew
each
other
lovborg
and
i
must
teach
myself
never
to
say
hedda
gabler
again
never
as
long
as
i
live
hedda
still
turning
over
the
pages
yes
you
must
and
i
think
you
ought
to
practise
in
time
the
sooner
the
better
i
should
say
lovborg
in
a
tone
of
indignation
hedda
gabler
married
and
married
to
george
tesman
hedda
yes
so
the
world
goes
lovborg
oh
hedda
hedda
how
could
you
throw
yourself
away
hedda
looks
sharply
at
him
what
i
ca
allow
this
lovborg
what
do
you
mean
tesman
comes
into
the
room
and
goes
towards
the
sofa
hedda
hears
him
coming
and
says
in
an
indifferent
tone
and
this
is
a
view
from
the
val
lovborg
just
look
at
these
peaks
looks
affectionately
up
at
tesman
what
the
name
of
these
curious
peaks
dear
tesman
let
me
see
oh
those
are
the
dolomites
hedda
yes
that
it
those
are
the
dolomites
lovborg
tesman
hedda
dear
i
only
wanted
to
ask
whether
i
should
bring
you
a
little
punch
after
all
for
yourself
at
any
rate
eh
hedda
yes
do
please
and
perhaps
a
few
biscuits
tesman
no
cigarettes
hedda
no
tesman
very
well
he
goes
into
the
inner
room
and
out
to
the
right
brack
sits
in
the
inner
room
and
keeps
an
eye
from
time
to
time
on
hedda
and
lovborg
lovborg
softly
as
before
answer
me
hedda
how
could
you
go
and
do
this
hedda
apparently
absorbed
in
the
album
if
you
continue
to
say
to
me
i
wo
talk
to
you
lovborg
may
i
not
say
even
when
we
are
alone
hedda
no
you
may
think
it
but
you
must
say
it
lovborg
ah
i
understand
it
is
an
offence
against
george
tesman
whom
you
love
hedda
glances
at
him
and
smiles
love
what
an
idea
lovborg
you
do
love
him
then
hedda
but
i
wo
hear
of
any
sort
of
unfaithfulness
remember
that
lovborg
hedda
answer
me
one
thing
hedda
hush
tesman
enters
with
a
small
tray
from
the
inner
room
tesman
here
you
are
is
this
tempting
he
puts
the
tray
on
the
table
hedda
why
do
you
bring
it
yourself
tesman
filling
the
glasses
because
i
think
it
such
fun
to
wait
upon
you
hedda
hedda
but
you
have
poured
out
two
glasses
lovborg
said
he
would
have
any
tesman
no
but
elvsted
will
soon
be
here
wo
she
hedda
yes
elvsted
tesman
had
you
forgotten
her
eh
hedda
we
were
so
absorbed
in
these
photographs
shows
him
a
picture
do
you
remember
this
little
village
tesman
oh
it
that
one
just
below
the
brenner
pass
it
was
there
we
passed
the
night
hedda
and
met
that
lively
party
of
tourists
tesman
yes
that
was
the
place
fancy
if
we
could
only
have
had
you
with
us
eilert
eh
he
returns
to
the
inner
room
and
sits
beside
brack
lovborg
answer
me
one
thing
hedda
hedda
well
lovborg
was
there
no
love
in
your
friendship
for
me
either
not
a
spark
not
a
tinge
of
love
in
it
hedda
i
wonder
if
there
was
to
me
it
seems
as
though
we
were
two
good
comrades
two
thoroughly
intimate
friends
smilingly
you
especially
were
frankness
itself
lovborg
it
was
you
that
made
me
so
hedda
as
i
look
back
upon
it
all
i
think
there
was
really
something
beautiful
something
fascinating
something
daring
in
in
that
secret
intimacy
that
comradeship
which
no
living
creature
so
much
as
dreamed
of
lovborg
yes
yes
hedda
was
there
not
when
i
used
to
come
to
your
in
the
afternoon
and
the
general
sat
over
at
the
window
reading
his
papers
with
his
back
towards
us
hedda
and
we
two
on
the
corner
sofa
lovborg
always
with
the
same
illustrated
paper
before
us
hedda
for
want
of
an
album
yes
lovborg
yes
hedda
and
when
i
made
my
confessions
to
you
told
you
about
myself
things
that
at
that
time
no
one
else
knew
there
i
would
sit
and
tell
you
of
my
escapades
my
days
and
nights
of
devilment
oh
hedda
what
was
the
power
in
you
that
forced
me
to
confess
these
things
hedda
do
you
think
it
was
any
power
in
me
lovborg
how
else
can
i
explain
it
and
all
those
those
roundabout
questions
you
used
to
put
to
me
hedda
which
you
understood
so
particularly
well
lovborg
how
could
you
sit
and
question
me
like
that
question
me
quite
frankly
hedda
in
roundabout
terms
please
observe
lovborg
yes
but
frankly
nevertheless
me
about
all
that
sort
of
thing
hedda
and
how
could
you
answer
lovborg
lovborg
yes
that
is
just
what
i
ca
understand
in
looking
back
upon
it
but
tell
me
now
hedda
was
there
not
love
at
the
bottom
of
our
friendship
on
your
side
did
you
not
feel
as
though
you
might
purge
my
stains
away
if
i
made
you
my
confessor
was
it
not
so
hedda
no
not
quite
lovborg
what
was
you
motive
then
hedda
do
think
it
quite
incomprehensible
that
a
young
girl
when
it
can
be
done
without
any
one
knowing
lovborg
well
hedda
should
be
glad
to
have
a
peep
now
and
then
into
a
world
which
lovborg
which
hedda
which
she
is
forbidden
to
know
anything
about
lovborg
so
that
was
it
hedda
partly
partly
i
almost
think
lovborg
comradeship
in
the
thirst
for
life
but
why
should
not
that
at
any
rate
have
continued
hedda
the
fault
was
yours
lovborg
it
was
you
that
broke
with
me
hedda
yes
when
our
friendship
threatened
to
develop
into
something
more
serious
shame
upon
you
eilert
lovborg
how
could
you
think
of
wronging
your
your
frank
comrade
lovborg
clenches
his
hands
oh
why
did
you
not
carry
out
your
threat
why
did
you
not
shoot
me
down
hedda
because
i
have
such
a
dread
of
scandal
lovborg
yes
hedda
you
are
a
coward
at
heart
hedda
a
terrible
coward
changing
her
tone
but
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
you
and
now
you
have
found
ample
consolation
at
the
elvsteds
lovborg
i
know
what
thea
has
confided
to
you
hedda
and
perhaps
you
have
confided
to
her
something
about
us
lovborg
not
a
word
she
is
too
stupid
to
understand
anything
of
that
sort
hedda
stupid
lovborg
she
is
stupid
about
matters
of
that
sort
hedda
and
i
am
cowardly
bends
over
towards
him
without
looking
him
in
the
face
and
says
more
softly
but
now
i
will
confide
something
to
you
lovborg
eagerly
well
hedda
the
fact
that
i
dared
not
shoot
you
down
lovborg
yes
hedda
that
was
not
my
arrant
cowardice
that
evening
lovborg
looks
at
her
a
moment
understands
and
whispers
passionately
oh
hedda
hedda
gabler
now
i
begin
to
see
a
hidden
reason
beneath
our
comradeship
you
and
i
after
all
then
it
was
your
craving
for
life
hedda
softly
with
a
sharp
glance
take
care
believe
nothing
of
the
sort
twilight
has
begun
to
fall
the
hall

is
opened

himself
on

lovborg
after
a
short
pause

liveable
after

with
a
sudden
change
of
tone

say
you
shall
lovborg
it
would
be
of
no
use
hedda
laughing
then
i
poor
creature
have
no
sort
of
power
over
you
lovborg
not
in
that
respect
hedda
but
seriously
i
think
you
ought
to
for
your
own
sake
elvsted
why
hedda
lovborg
how
so
hedda
or
rather
on
account
of
other
people
lovborg
indeed
hedda
otherwise
people
might
be
apt
to
suspect
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
did
not
feel
quite
secure
quite
confident
in
yourself
elvsted
softly
oh
please
hedda
lovborg
people
may
suspect
what
they
like
for
the
present
elvsted
joyfully
yes
let
them
hedda
i
saw
it
plainly
in
judge
brack
face
a
moment
ago
lovborg
what
did
you
see
hedda
his
contemptuous
smile
when
you
dared
not
go
with
them
into
the
inner
room
lovborg
dared
not
of
course
i
preferred
to
stop
here
and
talk
to
you
elvsted
what
could
be
more
natural
hedda
hedda
but
the
judge
could
not
guess
that
and
i
say
too
the
way
he
smiled
and
glanced
at
tesman
when
you
dared
not
accept
his
invitation
to
this
wretched
little
of
his
lovborg
dared
not
do
you
say
i
dared
not
hedda
do
say
so
but
that
was
how
judge
brack
understood
it
lovborg
well
let
him
hedda
then
you
are
not
going
with
them
lovborg
i
will
stay
here
with
you
and
thea
elvsted

can
you
doubt
that
hedda
smiles
and
nods
approvingly
to
lovborg

as
a
rock
faithful
to
your
principles
now
and
for
ever

and

judge
brack
tesman
have
you
been
anxious
about
me
eh
hedda
no
i

anxious
but
i
asked
if
you
had
enjoyed
yourself
tesman
oh
yes
for
once
in
a
way
especially
the
beginning
of
the
evening
for
then
eilert
read
me
part
of
his
book
we
arrived
more
than
an
hour
too
early
fancy
that
and
brack
had
all
sorts
of
arrangements
to
make
so
eilert
read
to
me
hedda
seating
herself
by
the
table
on
the
right
well
tell
me
then
tesman
sitting
on
a
footstool
near
the
stove
oh
hedda
you
ca
conceive
what
a
book
that
is
going
to
be
i
believe
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
that
have
ever
been
written
fancy
that
hedda
yes
yes
i
do
care
about
that
tesman
i
must
make
a
confession
to
you
hedda
when
he
had
finished
reading
a
horrid
feeling
came
over
me
hedda
a
horrid
feeling
tesman
i
felt
jealous
of
eilert
for
having
had
it
in
him
to
write
such
a
book
only
think
hedda
hedda
yes
yes
i
am
thinking
tesman
and
then
how
pitiful
to
think
that
he
with
all
his
gifts
should
be
irreclaimable
after
all
hedda
i
suppose
you
mean
that
he
has
more
courage
than
the
rest
tesman
no
not
at
all
i
mean
that
he
is
incapable
of
taking
his
pleasure
in
moderation
hedda
and
what
came
of
it
all
in
the
end
tesman
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
it
might
best
be
described
as
an
orgie
hedda
hedda
had
he
in
his
hair
tesman
no
i
saw
nothing
of
the
sort
but
he
made
a
long
rambling
speech
in
honour
of
the
woman
who
had
inspired
him
in
his
work
that
was
the
phrase
he
used
hedda
did
he
name
her
tesman
no
he
did
but
i
ca
help
thinking
he
meant
elvsted
you
may
be
sure
he
did
hedda
well
where
did
you
part
from
him
tesman
on
the
way
to
town
we
broke
up
the
last
of
us
at
any
rate
all
together
and
brack
came
with
us
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
then
you
see
we
agreed
to
take
eilert
home
for
he
had
had
far
more
than
was
good
for
him
hedda
i
daresay
tesman
but
now
comes
the
strange
part
of
it
hedda
or
i
should
rather
say
the
melancholy
part
of
it
i
declare
i
am
almost
ashamed
on
account
to
tell
you
hedda
oh
go
on
tesman
well
as
we
were
getting
near
town
you
see
i
happened
to
drop
a
little
behind
the
others
only
for
a
minute
or
two
fancy
that
hedda
yes
yes
yes
but
tesman
and
then
as
i
hurried
after
them
what
do
you
think
i
found
by
the
wayside
eh
hedda
oh
how
should
i
know
tesman
you
must
speak
of
it
to
a
soul
hedda
do
you
hear
promise
me
for
eilert
sake
draws
a
parcel
wrapped
in
paper
from
his
coat
pocket
fancy
dear
i
found
this
hedda
is
not
that
the
parcel
he
had
with
him
yesterday
tesman
yes
it
is
the
whole
of
his
precious
irreplaceable
manuscript
and
he
had
gone
and
lost
it
and
knew
nothing
about
it
only
fancy
hedda
so
deplorably
hedda
but
why
did
you
not
give
him
back
the
parcel
at
once
tesman
i
did
dare
to
in
the
state
he
was
then
in
hedda
did
you
not
tell
any
of
the
others
that
you
had
found
it
tesman
oh
far
from
it
you
can
surely
understand
that
for
eilert
sake
i
would
do
that
hedda
so
no
one
knows
that
eilert
lovborg
manuscript
is
in
your
possession
tesman
no
and
no
one
must
know
it
hedda
then
what
did
you
say
to
him
afterwards
tesman
i
did
talk
to
him
again
at
all
for
when
we
got
in
among
the
streets
he
and
two
or
three
of
the
others
gave
us
the
slip
and
disappeared
fancy
that
hedda
indeed
they
must
have
taken
him
home
then
tesman
yes
so
it
would
appear
and
brack
too
left
us
hedda
and
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
since
tesman
well
i
and
some
of
the
others
went
home
with
one
of
the
party
a
jolly
fellow
and
took
our
morning
coffee
with
him
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
call
it
our
night
coffee
eh
but
now
when
i
have
rested
a
little
and
given
eilert
poor
fellow
time
to
have
his
sleep
out
i
must
take
this
back
to
him
hedda
holds
out
her
hand
for
the
packet
no
do
give
it
to
him
not
in
such
a
hurry
i
mean
let
me
read
it
first
tesman
no
my
dearest
hedda
i
must
i
really
must
hedda
you
must
not
tesman
no
for
you
can
imagine
what
a
state
of
despair
he
will
be
in
when
he
wakens
and
misses
the
manuscript
he
has
no
copy
of
it
you
must
know
he
told
me
so
hedda
looking
searchingly
at
him
can
such
a
thing
not
be
reproduced
written
over
again
tesman
no
i
do
think
that
would
be
possible
for
the
inspiration
you
see
hedda
yes
yes
i
suppose
it
depends
on
that
lightly
but
here
is
a
letter
for
you
tesman
fancy
hedda
handing
it
to
him
it
came
early
this
morning
tesman
it
from
aunt
julia
what
can
it
be
he
lays
the
packet
on
the
other
footstool
opens
the
letter
runs
his
eye
through
it
and
jumps
up
oh
hedda
she
says
that
poor
aunt
rina
is
dying
hedda
well
we
were
prepared
for
that
tesman
and
that
if
i
want
to
see
her
again
i
must
make
haste
i
run
in
to
them
at
once
hedda
suppressing
a
smile
will
you
run
tesman
oh
my
dearest
hedda
if
you
could
only
make
up
your
mind
to
come
with
me
just
think
hedda
rises
and
says
wearily
repelling
the
idea
no
no
do
ask
me
i
will
not
look
upon
sickness
and
death
i
loathe
all
sorts
of
ugliness
tesman
well
well
then
bustling
around
my
hat
my
overcoat
oh
in
the
hall
i
do
hope
i
may
come
too
late
hedda
eh
hedda
oh
if
you
run
berta
appears
at
the
hall
door
berta
judge
brack
is
at
the
door
and
wishes
to
know
if
he
may
come
in
tesman
at
this
time
no
i
ca
possibly
see
him
hedda
but
i
can
to
berta
ask
judge
brack
to
come
in
berta
goes
out
hedda
quickly
whispering
the
parcel
tesman
she
snatches
it
up
from
the
stool
tesman
yes
give
it
to
me
hedda
no
no
i
will
keep
it
till
you
come
back
she
goes
to
the
and
places
it
in
the
bookcase
tesman
stands
in
a
flurry
of
haste
and
can
not
get
his
gloves
on
judge
brack
enters
from
the
hall
hedda
nodding
to
him
you
are
an
early
bird
i
must
say
brack
yes
do
you
think
so
to
tesman
are
you
on
the
move
too
tesman
yes
i
must
rush
of
to
my
aunts
fancy
the
invalid
one
is
lying
at
death
door
poor
creature
brack
dear
me
is
she
indeed
then
on
no
account
let
me
detain
you
at
such
a
critical
moment
tesman
yes
i
must
really
rush
he
hastens
out
by
the
hall
door
hedda
approaching
you
seem
to
have
made
a
particularly
lively
night
of
it
at
your
rooms
judge
brack
brack
i
assure
you
i
have
not
had
my
clothes
off
hedda
hedda
not
you
either
brack
no
as
you
may
see
but
what
has
tesman
been
telling
you
of
the
adventures
hedda
oh
some
tiresome
story
only
that
they
went
and
had
coffee
somewhere
or
other
brack
i
have
heard
about
that
already
eilert
lovborg
was
not
with
them
i
fancy
hedda
no
they
had
taken
him
home
before
that
brack
tesman
too
hedda
no
but
some
of
the
others
he
said
brack
smiling
george
tesman
is
really
an
ingenuous
creature
hedda
hedda
yes
heaven
knows
he
is
then
is
there
something
behind
all
this
brack
yes
perhaps
there
may
be
hedda
well
then
sit
down
my
dear
judge
and
tell
your
story
in
comfort
she
seats
herself
to
the
left
of
the
table
brack
sits
near
her
at
the
long
side
of
the
table
hedda
now
then
brack
i
had
special
reasons
for
keeping
track
of
my
guests
last
night
hedda
of
eilert
lovborg
among
the
rest
perhaps
brack
frankly
yes
hedda
now
you
make
me
really
curious
brack
do
you
know
where
he
and
one
or
two
of
the
others
finished
the
night
hedda
hedda
if
it
is
not
quite
unmentionable
tell
me
brack
oh
no
it
not
at
all
unmentionable
well
they
put
in
an
appearance
at
a
particularly
animated
soiree
hedda
of
the
lively
kind
brack
of
the
very
liveliest
hedda
tell
me
more
of
this
judge
brack
brack
lovborg
as
well
as
the
others
had
been
invited
in
advance
i
knew
all
about
it
but
he
had
declined
the
invitation
for
now
as
you
know
he
has
become
a
new
man
hedda
up
at
the
elvsteds
yes
but
he
went
after
all
then
brack
well
you
see
hedda
unhappily
the
spirit
moved
him
at
my
rooms
last
evening
hedda
yes
i
hear
he
found
inspiration
brack
pretty
violent
inspiration
well
i
fancy
that
altered
his
purpose
for
we
menfolk
are
unfortunately
not
always
so
firm
in
our
principles
as
we
ought
to
be
hedda
oh
i
am
sure
you
are
an
exception
judge
brack
but
as
to
lovborg
brack
to
make
a
long
story
short
he
landed
at
last
in
mademoiselle
rooms
hedda
mademoiselle
diana
brack
it
was
mademoiselle
diana
that
was
giving
the
soiree
to
a
select
circle
of
her
admirers
and
her
lady
friends
hedda
is
she
a
woman
brack
precisely
hedda
a
sort
of
a
singer
brack
oh
yes
in
her
leisure
moments
and
moreover
a
mighty
huntress
of
men
hedda
you
have
no
doubt
heard
of
her
eilert
lovborg
was
one
of
her
most
enthusiastic
protectors
in
the
days
of
his
glory
hedda
and
how
did
all
this
end
brack
far
from
amicably
it
appears
after
a
most
tender
meeting
they
seem
to
have
come
to
blows
hedda
lovborg
and
she
brack
yes
he
accused
her
or
her
friends
of
having
robbed
him
he
declared
that
his
had
disappeared
and
other
things
as
well
in
short
he
seems
to
have
made
a
furious
disturbance
hedda
and
what
came
of
it
all
brack
it
came
to
a
general
scrimmage
in
which
the
ladies
as
well
as
the
gentlemen
took
part
fortunately
the
police
at
last
appeared
on
the
scene
hedda
the
police
too
brack
yes
i
fancy
it
will
prove
a
costly
frolic
for
eilert
lovborg
crazy
being
that
he
is
hedda
how
so
brack
he
seems
to
have
made
a
violent
resistance
to
have
hit
one
of
the
constables
on
the
head
and
torn
the
coat
off
his
back
so
they
had
to
march
him
off
to
the
with
the
rest
hedda
how
have
you
learnt
all
this
brack
from
the
police
themselves
hedda
gazing
straight
before
her
so
that
is
what
happened
then
he
had
no
in
his
hair
brack
hedda
hedda
changing
her
tone
but
tell
me
now
judge
what
is
your
real
reason
for
tracking
out
eilert
lovborg
movements
so
carefully
brack
in
the
first
place
it
could
not
be
entirely
indifferent
to
me
if
it
should
appear
in
the
that
he
came
straight
from
my
house
hedda
will
the
matter
come
into
court
then
brack
of
course
however
i
should
scarcely
have
troubled
so
much
about
that
but
i
thought
that
as
a
friend
of
the
family
it
was
my
duty
to
supply
you
and
tesman
with
a
full
account
of
his
nocturnal
exploits
hedda
why
so
judge
brack
brack
why
because
i
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
he
intends
to
use
you
as
a
sort
of
blind
hedda
oh
how
can
you
think
such
a
thing
brack
good
heavens
hedda
we
have
eyes
in
our
head
mark
my
words
this
elvsted
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
town
again
hedda
well
even
if
there
should
be
anything
between
them
i
suppose
there
are
plenty
of
other
places
where
they
could
meet
brack
not
a
single
home
henceforth
as
before
every
respectable
house
will
be
closed
against
eilert
lovborg
hedda
and
so
ought
mine
to
be
you
mean
brack
yes
i
confess
it
would
be
more
than
painful
to
me
if
this
personage
were
to
be
made
free
of
your
house
how
superfluous
how
intrusive
he
would
be
if
he
were
to
force
his
way
into
hedda
into
the
triangle
brack
precisely
it
would
simply
mean
that
i
should
find
myself
homeless
hedda
looks
at
him
with
a
smile
so
you
want
to
be
the
one
cock
in
the
basket
that
is
your
aim
brack
nods
slowly
and
lowers
his
voice
yes
that
is
my
aim
and
for
that
i
will
fight
with
every
weapon
i
can
command
hedda
her
smile
vanishing
i
see
you
are
a
dangerous
person
when
it
comes
to
the
point
brack
do
you
think
so
hedda
i
am
beginning
to
think
so
and
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
think
that
you
have
no
sort
of
hold
over
me
brack
laughing
equivocally
well
well
hedda
perhaps
you
are
right
there
if
i
had
who
knows
what
i
might
be
capable
of
hedda
come
come
now
judge
brack
that
sounds
almost
like
a
threat
brack
rising
oh
not
at
all
the
triangle
you
know
ought
if
possible
to
be
spontaneously
constructed
hedda
there
i
agree
with
you
brack
well
now
i
have
said
all
i
had
to
say
and
i
had
better
be
getting
back
to
town
hedda
he
goes
towards
the
glass
door
hedda
rising
are
you
going
through
the
garden
brack
yes
it
a
short
cut
for
me
hedda
and
then
it
is
a
back
way
too
brack
quite
so
i
have
no
objection
to
back
ways
they
may
be
piquant
enough
at
times
hedda
when
there
is
ball
practice
going
on
you
mean
brack
in
the
doorway
laughing
to
her
oh
people
do
shoot
their
tame
poultry
i
fancy
hedda
also
laughing
oh
no
when
there
is
only
one
cock
in
the
basket
they
exchange
laughing
nods
of
farewell
he
goes
she
closes
the
door
behind
him
hedda
who
has
become
quite
serious
stands
for
a
moment
looking
out
presently
she
goes
and
peeps
through
the
curtain
over
the
middle
doorway
then
she
goes
to
the
takes
lovborg
packet
out
of
the
bookcase
and
is
on
the
point
of
looking
through
its
contents
berta
is
heard
speaking
loudly
in
the
hall
hedda
turns
and
listens
then
she
hastily
locks
up
the
packet
in
the
drawer
and
lays
the
key
on
the
inkstand
eilert
lovborg
with
his
greatcoat
on
and
his
hat
in
his
hand
tears
open
the
hall
door
he
looks
somewhat
confused
and
irritated
lovborg
looking
towards
the
hall
and
i
tell
you
i
must
and
will
come
in
there
he
closes
the
door
turns
sees
hedda
at
once
regains
his
control
and
bows
hedda
at
the
well
mr
lovborg
this
is
rather
a
late
hour
to
call
for
thea
lovborg
you
mean
rather
an
early
hour
to
call
on
you
pray
pardon
me
hedda
how
do
you
know
that
she
is
still
here
lovborg
they
told
me
at
her
lodgings
that
she
had
been
out
all
night
hedda
going
to
the
oval
table
did
you
notice
anything
about
the
people
of
the
house
when
they
said
that
lovborg
looks
inquiringly
at
her
notice
anything
about
them
hedda
i
mean
did
they
seem
to
think
it
odd
lovborg
suddenly
understanding
oh
yes
of
course
i
am
dragging
her
down
with
me
however
i
did
notice
i
suppose
tesman
is
not
up
yet
hedda
no
i
think
not
lovborg
when
did
he
come
home
hedda
very
late
lovborg
did
he
tell
you
anything
hedda
yes
i
gathered
that
you
had
had
an
exceedingly
jolly
evening
at
judge
brack
lovborg
nothing
more
hedda
i
do
think
so
however
i
was
so
dreadfully
sleepy
elvsted
enters
through
the
curtains
of
the
middle
doorway
elvsted
going
towards
him
ah
lovborg
at
last
lovborg
yes
at
last
and
too
late
elvsted
looks
anxiously
at
him
what
is
too
late
lovborg
everything
is
too
late
now
it
is
all
over
with
me
elvsted
oh

no
do
say
that
lovborg
you
will
say
the
same
when
you
hear
elvsted
i
wo
hear

perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
talk
to
her
alone
if
so
i
will
leave
you
lovborg
no
stay
you
too
i
beg
you
to
stay

adventures
that
i
want
to
talk
about

it
then
lovborg
i
want
to
say
that
now
our
ways
must
part

hedda
involuntarily
i
knew
it
lovborg
you
can
be
of
no
more
service
to
me
thea
elvsted
how
can
you
stand
there
and
say
that

foreboding
lovborg
what

with
the
manuscript
hedda
looks
anxiously
at
him
yes
the
manuscript
elvsted
where
is
it
lovborg
the
manuscript
well
then
i
have
torn
the
manuscript
into
a
thousand
pieces
elvsted
shrieks
oh
no
no
hedda
involuntarily
but
that
not
lovborg
looks
at
her
not
true
you
think
hedda
collecting
herself
oh
well
of
course
since
you
say
so
but
it
sounded
so
improbable
lovborg
it
is
true
all
the
same
elvsted
wringing
her
hands
oh
god
oh
god
hedda
torn
his
own
work
to
pieces
lovborg
i
have
torn
my
own
life
to
pieces
so
why
should
i
not
tear
my
too
elvsted
and
you
did
this
last
night
lovborg
yes
i
tell
you
tore
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
scattered
them
on
the
fiord
far
out
there
there
is
cool
at
any
rate
let
them
drift
upon
it
drift
with
the
current
and
the
wind
and
then
presently
they
will
sink
deeper
and
deeper
as
i
shall
thea
elvsted
do
you
know
lovborg
that
what
you
have
done
with
the
book
i
shall
think
of
it
to
my
dying
day
as
though
you
had
killed
a
little
child
lovborg
yes
you
are
right
it
is
a
sort
of
elvsted
how
could
you
then
did
not
the
child
belong
to
me
too
hedda
almost
inaudibly
ah
the
child
elvsted
breathing
heavily
it
is
all
over
then
well
well
now
i
will
go
hedda
hedda
but
you
are
not
going
away
from
town
elvsted
oh
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
i
see
nothing
but
darkness
before
me
she
goes
out
by
the
hall
door
hedda
stands
waiting
for
a
moment
so
you
are
not
going
to
see
her
home
lovborg
lovborg
i
through
the
streets
would
you
have
people
see
her
walking
with
me
hedda
of
course
i
do
know
what
else
may
have
happened
last
night
but
is
it
so
utterly
irretrievable
lovborg
it
will
not
end
with
last
night
i
know
that
perfectly
well
and
the
thing
is
that
now
i
have
no
taste
for
that
sort
of
life
either
i
begin
it
anew
she
has
broken
my
courage
and
my
power
of
braving
life
out
hedda
looking
straight
before
her
so
that
pretty
little
fool
has
had
her
fingers
in
a
man
destiny
looks
at
him
but
all
the
same
how
could
you
treat
her
so
heartlessly
lovborg
oh
do
say
that
i
was
heartless
hedda
to
go
and
destroy
what
has
filled
her
whole
soul
for
months
and
years
you
do
not
call
that
heartless
lovborg
to
you
i
can
tell
the
truth
hedda
hedda
the
truth
lovborg
first
promise
me
give
me
your
word
that
what
i
now
confide
in
you
thea
shall
never
know
hedda
i
give
you
my
word
lovborg
good
then
let
me
tell
you
that
what
i
said
just
now
was
untrue
hedda
about
the
manuscript
lovborg
yes
i
have
not
torn
it
to
pieces
nor
thrown
it
into
the
fiord
hedda
no
no
but
where
is
it
then
lovborg
i
have
destroyed
it
none
the
less
utterly
destroyed
it
hedda
hedda
i
do
understand
lovborg
thea
said
that
what
i
had
done
seemed
to
her
like
a
hedda
yes
so
she
said
lovborg
but
to
kill
his
child
that
is
not
the
worst
thing
a
father
can
do
to
it
hedda
not
the
worst
lovborg
suppose
now
hedda
that
a
man
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
came
home
to
his
child
mother
after
a
night
of
riot
and
debauchery
and
said
listen
i
have
been
here
and
there
in
this
place
and
in
that
and
i
have
taken
our
child
with
to
this
place
and
to
that
and
i
have
lost
the
child
utterly
lost
it
the
devil
knows
into
what
hands
it
may
have
fallen
who
may
have
had
their
clutches
on
it
hedda
well
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
you
know
this
was
only
a
book
lovborg
thea
pure
soul
was
in
that
book
hedda
yes
so
i
understand
lovborg
and
you
can
understand
too
that
for
her
and
me
together
no
future
is
possible
hedda
what
path
do
you
mean
to
take
then
lovborg
none
i
will
only
try
to
make
an
end
of
it
all
the
sooner
the
better
hedda
a
step
nearer
him
eilert
lovborg
listen
to
will
you
not
try
to
to
do
it
beautifully
lovborg

smiling
with
in
my
hair
as
you
used
to
dream
in
the
old
days
hedda
no
no
i
have
lost
my
faith
in

beautifully
nevertheless
for
once
in
a
way
you

go

do
not
come
here
any
more
lovborg
tesman
and
give
george
tesman
my
love
he

the
then

with
one
of

this
the
memento
hedda
nodding
slowly
do
you
recognise
it
it
was
aimed
at
you
once
lovborg
you

by
the
hanging
lamp
over
the

the
curtains
over
the
glass
door
are
drawn
close
hedda
dressed
in
black
walks
to
and
fro
in
the
dark

then
she
goes
into

disappears
for
a
moment
to

circumspectly
out

goes
up
to
the
glass

already
as
you
see
tesman
sent
me
a
card
miss
tesman
yes
he
promised
me
he
would
but
nevertheless
i
thought
that

myself
to
bring
the
tidings
of
death
hedda
that
was

kind
of
you
miss
tesman
ah
rina

not

not
the
time
for
hedda
house
to
be
a
house
of
mourning
hedda
changing
the
subject
she
died
quite
peacefully
did
she
not
miss
tesman
miss
tesman
oh
her
end
was
so
calm
so
beautiful
and
then
she
had
the
unspeakable
happiness
of
seeing
george
once
more
and
bidding
him
has
he
not
come
home
yet
hedda
no
he
wrote
that

to
her
grave
looking
her
best
hedda

not

you
in
any
way
miss
tesman
oh
you
must
not
think
of
it
hedda
tesman
must
have
no
hand
in
such
mournful
work
nor
let
her
thought
dwell
on
it
either
not
at
this
time
hedda
one
is
not
always
mistress
of
one
thoughts
miss
tesman
continuing
ah
yes

is
the
way
of
the
world
at
home
we
shall
be
sewing
a
shroud
and
here
there
will
soon
be
sewing

of
another
sort
thank
god
george
tesman
enters
by
the
hall
door
hedda
ah
you
have
come
at
last
tesman
you
here
aunt
julia
with
hedda
fancy
that
miss
tesman
i
was
just
going
my
dear
boy
well
have
you
done
all
you
promised
tesman
no
i
really
afraid
i
have
forgotten
half
of
it
i
must
come
to
you
again
my
brain
is
all
in
a
whirl
i
ca
keep
my
thoughts
together
miss
tesman
why
my
dear
george
you
must
take
it
in
this
way
tesman
must
how
do
you
mean
miss
tesman
even
in
your
sorrow
you
must
rejoice
as
i
do
rejoice
that
she
is
at
rest
tesman
oh
yes
yes
you
are
thinking
of
aunt
rina
hedda
you
will
feel
lonely
now
miss
tesman
miss
tesman
just
at
first
yes
but
that
will
not
last
very
long
i
hope
i
daresay
i
shall
soon
find
an
occupant
for
rina
little
room
tesman
indeed
who
do
you
think
will
take
it
eh
miss
tesman
oh
there
always
some
poor
invalid
or
other
in
want
of
nursing
unfortunately
hedda
would
you
really
take
such
a
burden
upon
you
again
miss
tesman
a
burden
heaven
forgive
you
child
it
has
been
no
burden
to
me
hedda
but
suppose
you
had
a
total
stranger
on
your
hands
miss
tesman
oh
one
soon
makes
friends
with
sick
folk
and
it
such
an
absolute
necessity
for
me
to
have
some
one
to
live
for
well
heaven
be
praised
there
may
soon
be
something
in
this
house
too
to
keep
an
old
aunt
busy
hedda
oh
do
trouble
about
anything
here
tesman
yes
just
fancy
what
a
nice
time
we
three
might
have
together
if
hedda
if
tesman
uneasily
oh
nothing
it
will
all
come
right
let
us
hope
so
eh
miss
tesman
well
well
i
daresay
you
two
want
to
talk
to
each
other
smiling
and
perhaps
hedda
may
have
something
to
tell
you
too
george
i
must
go
home
to
rina
turning
at
the
door
how
strange
it
is
to
think
that
now
rina
is
with
me
and
with
my
poor
brother
as
well
tesman
yes
fancy
that
aunt
julia
eh
miss
tesman
goes
out
by
the
hall
door
hedda
follows
tesman
coldly
and
searchingly
with
her
eyes
i
almost
believe
your
aunt
rina
death
affects
you
more
than
it
does
your
aunt
julia
tesman
oh
it
not
that
alone
it
eilert
i
am
so
terribly
uneasy
about
hedda
quickly
is
there
anything
new
about
him
tesman
i
looked
in
at
his
rooms
this
afternoon
intending
to
tell
him
the
manuscript
was
in
safe
keeping
hedda
well
did
you
find
him
tesman
no
he
was
at
home
but
afterwards
i
met
elvsted
and
she
told
me
that
he
had
been
here
early
this
morning
hedda
yes
directly
after
you
had
gone
tesman
and
he
said
that
he
had
torn
his
manuscript
to
pieces
eh
hedda
yes
so
he
declared
tesman
why
good
heavens
he
must
have
been
completely
out
of
his
mind
and
i
suppose
you
thought
it
best
not
to
give
it
back
to
him
hedda
hedda
no
he
did
not
get
it
tesman
but
of
course
you
told
him
that
we
had
it
hedda
no
quickly
did
you
tell
elvsted
tesman
no
i
thought
i
had
better
not
but
you
ought
to
have
told
him
fancy
if
in
desperation
he
should
go
and
do
himself
some
injury
let
me
have
the
manuscript
hedda
i
will
take
it
to
him
at
once
where
is
it
hedda
cold
and
immovable
leaning
on
the
i
have
not
got
it
tesman
have
not
got
it
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
hedda
i
have
burnt
it
every
line
of
it
tesman
with
a
violent
movement
of
terror
burnt
burnt
eilert
manuscript
hedda
do
scream
so
the
servant
might
hear
you
tesman
burnt
why
good
god
no
no
no
it
impossible
hedda
it
is
so
nevertheless
tesman
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
hedda
it
unlawful
appropriation
of
lost
property
fancy
that
just
ask
judge
brack
and
he
tell
you
what
it
is
hedda
i
advise
you
not
to
speak
of
it
either
to
judge
brack
or
to
anyone
else
tesman
but
how
could
you
do
anything
so
what
put
it
into
your
head
what
possessed
you
answer
me
that
eh
hedda
suppressing
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
i
did
it
for
your
sake
george
tesman
for
my
sake
hedda
this
morning
when
you
told
me
about
what
he
had
read
to
you
tesman
yes
yes
what
then
hedda
you
acknowledged
that
you
envied
him
his
work
tesman
oh
of
course
i
did
mean
that
literally
hedda
no
matter
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
any
one
should
throw
you
into
the
shade
tesman
in
an
outburst
of
mingled
doubt
and
joy
hedda
oh
is
this
true
but
but
i
never
knew
you
show
your
love
like
that
before
fancy
that
hedda
well
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
just
at
this
time
impatiently
breaking
off
no
no
you
can
ask
aunt
julia
she
well
tell
you
fast
enough
tesman
oh
i
almost
think
i
understand
you
hedda
clasps
his
hands
together
great
heavens
do
you
really
mean
it
eh
hedda
do
shout
so
the
servant
might
hear
tesman
laughing
in
irrepressible
glee
the
servant
why
how
absurd
you
are
hedda
it
only
my
old
berta
why
i
tell
berta
myself
hedda
clenching
her
hands
together
in
desperation
oh
it
is
killing
me
it
is
killing
me
all
this
tesman
what
is
hedda
eh
hedda
coldly
controlling
herself
all
this
absurdity
george
tesman
absurdity
do
you
see
anything
absurd
in
my
being
overjoyed
at
the
news
but
after
all
perhaps
i
had
better
not
say
anything
to
berta
hedda
oh
why
not
that
too
tesman
no
no
not
yet
but
i
must
certainly
tell
aunt
julia
and
then
that

at
my
just
as

came
in
oh
the
most
incredible
rumours
are
afloat
about
him
tesman
yes
fancy
so
i
heard
too
and
i
can
bear
witness
that
he
went
straight
home
to
bed
last
night
fancy
that
hedda
well
what
did
they
say
at
the
elvsted
oh
i
could
make
out
anything
clearly
either
they
knew
nothing
definite
or
else
they
stopped
talking
when
the
saw
me
and
i
did
not
dare
to
ask
tesman
moving
about
uneasily
we
must
hope
we
must
hope
that
you
misunderstood
them
elvsted
elvsted
no

i
am
sure
it
was
of
him
they
were
talking
and
i
heard
something
about

hospital

no
surely

can
not
be
elvsted

make
up
your
mind
to
that
thea
elvsted
what
else

suspense
no
longer

and
the
people
knew
nothing
about
him

happened
to
him

would
it
be
if

were
to
go
and
make
inquiries

up
in
this
affair
judge

his
hat
in
his
hand
enters
by
the
hall
door
which
berta
opens
and
closes
behind
him
he
looks
grave
and
bows
in
silence
tesman

heard
the
news
about

brack
yes
that
among
other
things
tesman

looks
doubtfully
at
him
has
anything
else
happened
brack
yes
hedda
in
suspense
anything
sad
judge
brack
brack
that
too
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
tesman
elvsted
unable
to
restrain
her
anxiety
oh
it
is
something
about
eilert
lovborg
brack
with
a
glance
at
her
what
makes
you
think
that
madam
perhaps
you
have
already
heard
something
elvsted
in
confusion
no
nothing
at
all
but
tesman
oh
for
heaven
sake

us
brack
shrugging
his
shoulders
well

regret
to
say

is
lying
at
the
point
of
death
elvsted
shrieks
oh
god

god
tesman
to
the
hospital
and
at
the
point
of
death
hedda
involuntarily
so
soon
then
elvsted
wailing
and
we
parted
in
anger
hedda
hedda
whispers
thea
thea
be
careful
elvsted
not
heeding
her
i
must
go
to
him
i
must
see
him
alive
brack
it
is
useless
madam
no
one
will
be
admitted
elvsted
oh
at
least
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
him
what
is
it
tesman
you
do
mean
to
say
that
he
has
himself
eh
hedda
yes
i
am
sure
he
has
brack
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
unfortunately
you
have
guessed
quite
correctly
tesman
elvsted
oh
how
horrible
tesman
himself
then
fancy
that
hedda
shot
himself
brack
rightly
guessed
again
tesman
elvsted
with
an
effort
at
when
did
it
happen
brack
brack
this
afternoon
between
three
and
four
tesman
but
good
lord
where
did
he
do
it
eh
brack
with
some
hesitation
where
well
i
suppose
at
his
lodgings
elvsted
no
that
can
not
be
for
i
was
there
between
six
and
seven
brack
well
then
somewhere
else
i
do
know
exactly
i
only
know
that
he
was
found
he
had
shot
himself
in
the
breast
elvsted
oh
how
terrible
that
he
should
die
like
that
hedda
to
brack
was
it
in
the
breast
brack
yes
as
i
told
you
hedda
not
in
the
temple
brack
in
the
breast
tesman
hedda
well
well
the
breast
is
a
good
place
too
brack
how
do
you
mean
tesman
hedda
evasively
oh
nothing
nothing
tesman
and
the
wound
is
dangerous
you
say
eh
brack
absolutely
mortal
the
end
has
probably
come
by
this
time
elvsted
yes
yes
i
feel
it
the
end
the
end
oh
hedda
tesman
but
tell
me
how
have
you
learnt
all
this
brack
curtly
through
one
of
the
police
a
man
i
had
some
business
with
hedda
in
a
clear
voice
at
last
a
deed
worth
doing
tesman
terrified
good
heavens
hedda
what
are
you
saying
hedda
i
say
there
is
beauty
in
this
brack
h
tesman
elvsted
oh
hedda
how
can
you
talk
of
beauty
in
such
an
act
hedda
eilert
lovborg
has
himself
made
up
his
account
with
life
he
has
had
the
courage
to
do
the
one
right
thing
elvsted
no
you
must
never
think
that
was
how
it
happened
it
must
have
been
in
delirium
that
he
did
it
tesman
in
despair
hedda
that
he
did
not
i
am
certain
of
that
elvsted
yes
yes
in
delirium
just
as
when
he
tore
up
our
manuscript
brack
starting
the
manuscript
has
he
torn
that
up
elvsted
yes
last
night
tesman
whispers
softly
oh
hedda
we
shall
never
get
over
this
brack
h
very
extraordinary
tesman
moving
about
the
room
to
think
of
eilert
going
out
of
the
world
in
this
way
and
not
leaving
behind
him
the
book
that
would
have
immortalised
his
name
elvsted
oh
if
only
it
could
be
put
together
again
tesman
yes
if
it
only
could
i
do
know
what
i
would
not
give
elvsted
perhaps
it
can
tesman
tesman
what
do
you
mean
elvsted
searches
in
the
pocket
of
her
dress
look
here
i
have
kept
all
the
loose
notes
he
used
to
dictate
from
hedda
a
step
forward
ah
tesman
you
have
kept
them
elvsted
eh
elvsted
yes
i
have
them
here
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
when
i
left
home
here
they
still
are
tesman
oh
do
let
me
see
them
elvsted
hands
him
a
bundle
of
papers
but
they
are
in
such
disorder
all
mixed
up
tesman
fancy
if
we
could
make
something
out
of
them
after
all
perhaps
if
we
two
put
our
heads
together
elvsted
oh
yes
at
least
let
us
try
tesman
we
will
manage
it
we
must
i
will
dedicate
my
life
to
this
task
hedda
you
george
your
life
tesman
yes
or
rather
all
the
time
i
can
spare
my
own
collections
must
wait
in
the
meantime
hedda
you
understand
eh
i
owe
this
to
eilert
memory
hedda
perhaps
tesman
and
so
my
dear
elvsted
we
will
give
our
whole
minds
to
it
there
is
no
use
in
brooding
over
what
ca
be
undone
eh
we
must
try
to
control
our
grief
as
much
as
possible
and
elvsted
yes
yes
tesman
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
tesman
well
then
come
here
i
ca
rest
until
we
have
looked
through
the
notes
where
shall
we
sit
here
no
in
there
in
the
back
room
excuse
me
my
dear
judge
come
with
me
elvsted
elvsted
oh
if
only
it
were
possible
tesman
and
elvsted
go
into
the
back
room
she
takes
off
her
hat
and
cloak
they
both
sit
at
the
table
under
the
hanging
lamp
and
are
soon
deep
in
an
eager
examination
of
the
papers
hedda
crosses
to
the
stove
and
sits
in
the
chair
presently
brack
goes
up
to
her
hedda
in
a
low
voice
oh
what
a
sense
of
freedom
it
gives
one
this
act
of
eilert
lovborg
brack
freedom
hedda
well
of
course
it
is
a
release
for
him
hedda
i
mean
for
me
it
gives
me
a
sense
of
freedom
to
know
that
a
deed
of
deliberate
courage
is
still
possible
in
this
world
a
deed
of
spontaneous
beauty
brack
smiling
h
my
dear
hedda
hedda
oh
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
for
you
are
a
kind
of
specialist
too
like
you
know
brack
looking
hard
at
her
eilert
lovborg
was
more
to
you
than
perhaps
you
are
willing
to
admit
to
yourself
am
i
wrong
hedda
i
do
answer
such
questions
i
only
know
that
eilert
lovborg
has
had
the
courage
to
live
his
life
after
his
own
fashion
and
then
the
last
great
act
with
its
beauty
ah
that
he
should
have
the
will
and
the
strength
to
turn
away
from
the
banquet
of
life
so
early
brack
i
am
sorry
hedda
but
i
fear
i
must
dispel
an
amiable
illusion
hedda
illusion
brack
which
could
not
have
lasted
long
in
any
case
hedda
what
do
you
mean
brack
eilert
lovborg
did
not
shoot
himself
voluntarily
hedda
not
voluntarily
brack
no
the
thing
did
not
happen
exactly
as
i
told
it
hedda
in
suspense
have
you
concealed
something
what
is
it
brack
for
poor
elvsted
sake
i
idealised
the
facts
a
little
hedda
what
are
the
facts
brack
first
that
he
is
already
dead
hedda
at
the
hospital
brack
yes
without
regaining
consciousness
hedda
what
more
have
you
concealed
brack
this
the
event
did
not
happen
at
his
lodgings
hedda
oh
that
can
make
no
difference
brack
perhaps
it
may
for
i
must
tell
you
eilert
lovborg
was
found
shot
in
in
mademoiselle
diana
boudoir
hedda
makes
a
motion
as
if
to
rise
but
sinks
back
again
that
is
impossible
judge
brack
he
can
not
have
been
there
again
brack
he
was
there
this
afternoon
he
went
there
he
said
to
demand
the
return
of
something
which
they
had
taken
from
him
talked
wildly
about
a
lost
child
hedda
ah
so
that
is
why
brack
i
thought
probably
he
meant
his
manuscript
but
now
i
hear
he
destroyed
that
himself
so
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
his
hedda
yes
no
doubt
and
there
there
he
was
found
brack
yes
there
with
a
pistol
in
his
discharged
the
ball
had
lodged
in
a
vital
part
hedda
in
the
breast
yes
brack
no
in
the
bowels
hedda
looks
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
loathing
that
too
oh
what
curse
is
it
that
makes
everything
i
touch
turn
ludicrous
and
mean
brack
there
is
one
point
more
hedda
another
disagreeable
feature
in
the
affair
hedda
and
what
is
that
brack
the
pistol
he
carried
hedda
breathless
well
what
of
it
brack
he
must
have
stolen
it
hedda
leaps
up
stolen
it
that
is
not
true
he
did
not
steal
it
brack
no
other
explanation
is
possible
he
must
have
stolen
it
hush
tesman
and
elvsted
have
risen
from
the
table
in
the
room
and
come
into
the
tesman
with
the
papers
in
both
his
hands
hedda
dear
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
under
that
lamp
think
of
that
hedda
yes
i
am
thinking
tesman
would
you
mind
our
sitting
at
you
eh
hedda
if
you
like
quickly
no
wait
let
me
clear
it
first
tesman
oh
you
need
trouble
hedda
there
is
plenty
of
room
hedda
no
no
let
me
clear
it
i
say
i
will
take
these
things
in
and
put
them
on
the
piano
there
she
has
drawn
out
an
object
covered
with
sheet
music
from
under
the
bookcase
places
several
other
pieces
of
music
upon
it
and
carries
the
whole
into
the
inner
room
to
the
left
tesman
lays
the
scraps
of
paper
on
the
and
moves
the
lamp
there
from
the
corner
table
he
and
elvsted
sit
down
and
proceed
with
their
work
hedda
returns
hedda
behind
elvsted
chair
gently
ruffling
her
hair
well
my
sweet
thea
how
goes
it
with
eilert
lovborg
monument
elvsted
looks
dispiritedly
up
at
her
oh
it
will
be
terribly
hard
to
put
in
order
tesman
we
must
manage
it
i
am
determined
and
arranging
other
people
papers
is
just
the
work
for
me
hedda
goes
over
to
the
stove
and
seats
herself
on
one
of
the
footstools
brack
stands
over
her
leaning
on
the
hedda
whispers
what
did
you
say
about
the
pistol
brack
softly
that
he
must
have
stolen
it
hedda
why
stolen
it
brack
because
every
other
explanation
ought
to
be
impossible
hedda
hedda
indeed
brack
glances
at
her
of
course
eilert
lovborg
was
here
this
morning
was
he
not
hedda
yes
brack
were
you
alone
with
him
hedda
part
of
the
time
brack
did
you
not
leave
the
room
whilst
he
was
here
hedda
no
brack
try
to
recollect
were
you
not
out
of
the
room
a
moment
hedda
yes
perhaps
just
a
moment
out
in
the
hall
brack
and
where
was
you
during
that
time
hedda
i
had
it
locked
up
in
brack
well
hedda
hedda
the
case
stood
there
on
the
brack
have
you
looked
since
to
see
whether
both
the
pistols
are
there
hedda
no
brack
well
you
need
not
i
saw
the
pistol
found
in
lovborg
pocket
and
i
knew
it
at
once
as
the
one
i
had
seen
yesterday
and
before
too
hedda
have
you
it
with
you
brack
no
the
police
have
it
hedda
what
will
the
police
do
with
it
brack
search
till
they
find
the
owner
hedda
do
you
think
they
will
succeed
brack
bends
over
her
and
whispers
no
hedda
gabler
not
so
long
as
i
say
nothing
hedda
looks
frightened
at
him
and
if
you
do
not
say
nothing
what
then
brack
shrugs
his
shoulders
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
pistol
was
stolen
hedda
firmly
death
rather
than
that
brack
smiling
people
say
such
things
but
they
do
do
them
hedda
without
replying
and
supposing
the
pistol
was
not
stolen
and
the
owner
is
discovered
what
then
brack
well
hedda
then
comes
the
scandal
hedda
the
scandal
brack
yes
the
scandal
of
which
you
are
so
mortally
afraid
you
will
of
course
be
brought
before
the
court
both
you
and
mademoiselle
diana
she
will
have
to
explain
how
the
thing
happened
whether
it
was
an
accidental
shot
or
murder
did
the
pistol
go
off
as
he
was
trying
to
take
it
out
of
his
pocket
to
threaten
her
with
or
did
she
tear
the
pistol
out
of
his
hand
shoot
him
and
push
it
back
into
his
pocket
that
would
be
quite
like
her
for
she
is
an
young
person
this
same
mademoiselle
diana
hedda
but
have
nothing
to
do
with
all
this
repulsive
business
brack
no
but
you
will
have
to
answer
the
question
why
did
you
give
eilert
the
pistol
and
what
conclusions
will
people
draw
from
the
fact
that
you
did
give
it
to
him
hedda
lets
her
head
sink
that
is
true
i
did
not
think
of
that
brack
well
fortunately
there
is
no

used
to
the
inevitable

hedda
goes
into
the
back
room
and
draws
the
curtains
a
short
pause
suddenly
she
is
heard
playing
a
wild
dance
on
the
piano
elvsted
starts
from
her
chair
oh
what
is
that
tesman
runs
to
the
doorway

hedda
puts
her

between
the
curtains
and
of

julia
and
of
all
the
rest
of
after
this
i
will
be
quiet

the
curtains
again
tesman
at
the
it
not
good
for
her
to
see
us
at
this
distressing
work
i
tell
you
what
elvsted
you
shall
take
the
empty
room
at
aunt
julia
and
then
i
will
come
over
in
the
evenings
and
we
can
sit
and
work
there
eh
hedda
in
the
inner
room
i
hear
what
you
are
saying
tesman
but
how
am
to
get
through
the
evenings
out
here
tesman
turning
over
the
papers
oh
i
daresay
judge
brack
will
be
so
kind
as
to
look
in
now
and
then
even
though
i
am
out
brack
in
the
calls
out
gaily
every
blessed
evening
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
tesman
we
shall
get
on
capitally
together
we
two
hedda
speaking
loud
and
clear
yes
do
you
flatter
yourself
we
will
judge
brack
now
that
you
are
the
one
cock
in
the
basket
a
shot
is
heard
within
tesman
elvsted
and
brack
leap
to
their
feet
tesman
oh
now
she
is
playing
with
those
pistols
again
he
throws
back
the
curtains
and
runs
in
followed
by
elvsted
hedda
lies
stretched
on
the
sofa
lifeless
confusion
and
cries
berta
enters
in
alarm
from
the
right
tesman
shrieks
to
brack
shot
herself
shot
herself
in
the
temple
fancy
that
brack
in
the
good
god
people
do
do
such
things
the
end
footnotes
pronounce
in
the
original
statsradinde
falks
villa
showing
that
it
had
belonged
to
the
widow
of
a
cabinet
minister
equals
thou
tesman
means
if
you
could
persuade
yourself
to
her
see
previous
note
pronounce
and
elvsted
here
uses
the
formal
pronoun
whereupon
hedda
rebukes
her
in
her
next
speech
elvsted
says
bagveje
means
both
back
ways
and
underhand
courses
as
this
form
of
address
is
contrary
to
english
usage
and
as
the
note
of
familiarity
would
be
lacking
in
tesman
brack
may
in
stage
representation
say
miss
hedda
thus
ignoring
her
marriage
and
reverting
to
the
form
of
address
no
doubt
customary
between
them
of
old
he
uses
the
familiar
from
this
point
onward
lovborg
use
the
formal
in
this
speech
he
once
more
says
hedda
addresses
him
throughout
as
enest
hane
i
kurven
a
proverbial
saying
literally
that
you
burn
for
me
