preface
as
the
invaluable
present
i
am
making
to
the
world
may
not
please
all
tastes
from
the
gravity
of
the
matter
the
solidity
of
the
reasoning
and
the
deep
learning
contained
in
the
ensuing
sheets
it
is
necessary
to
make
some
apology
for
producing
this
work
in
so
trifling
an
age
when
nothing
will
go
down
but
temporary
politics
personal
satire
and
idle
romances
the
true
reason
then
for
my
surmounting
all
these
objections
was
singly
this
i
was
apprehensive
lest
the
work
should
be
lost
to
posterity
and
though
it
may
be
condemned
at
present
i
can
have
no
doubt
but
it
will
be
treated
with
due
reverence
some
hundred
ages
hence
when
wisdom
and
learning
shall
have
gained
their
proper
ascendant
over
mankind
and
when
men
shall
only
read
for
instruction
and
improvement
of
their
minds
as
i
shall
print
an
hundred
thousand
copies
some
it
may
be
hoped
will
escape
the
havoc
that
is
made
of
moral
works
and
then
this
jewel
will
shine
forth
in
its
genuine
lustre
i
was
in
the
greater
hurry
to
consign
this
work
to
the
press
as
i
foresee
that
the
art
of
printing
will
ere
long
be
totally
lost
like
other
useful
discoveries
well
known
to
the
ancients
such
were
the
art
of
dissolving
rocks
with
hot
vinegar
of
teaching
elephants
to
dance
on
the
slack
rope
of
making
malleable
glass
of
writing
epic
poems
that
any
body
would
read
after
they
had
been
published
a
month
and
the
stupendous
invention
of
new
religions
a
secret
of
which
illiterate
mahomet
was
the
last
person
possessed
notwithstanding
this
my
zeal
for
good
letters
and
the
ardour
of
my
universal
citizenship
for
i
declare
i
design
this
present
for
all
nations
there
are
some
small
difficulties
in
the
way
that
prevent
my
conferring
this
my
great
benefaction
on
the
world
compleatly
and
all
at
once
i
am
obliged
to
produce
it
in
small
portions
and
therefore
beg
the
prayers
of
all
good
and
wise
men
that
my
life
may
be
prolonged
to
me
till
i
shall
be
able
to
publish
the
whole
work
no
man
else
being
capable
of
executing
the
charge
so
well
as
myself
for
reasons
that
my
modesty
will
not
permit
me
to
specify
in
the
mean
time
as
it
is
the
duty
of
an
editor
to
acquaint
the
world
with
what
relates
to
himself
as
well
as
his
author
i
think
it
right
to
mention
the
causes
that
compel
me
to
publish
this
work
in
numbers
the
common
reason
of
such
proceeding
is
to
make
a
book
dearer
for
the
ease
of
the
purchasers
it
being
supposed
that
most
people
had
rather
give
twenty
shillings
by
sixpence
a
fortnight
than
pay
ten
shillings
once
for
all
public
spirited
as
this
proceeding
is
i
must
confess
my
reasons
are
more
and
merely
personal
as
my
circumstances
are
very
moderate
and
barely
sufficient
to
maintain
decently
a
gentleman
of
my
abilities
and
learning
i
can
not
afford
to
print
at
once
an
hundred
thousand
copies
of
two
volumes
in
folio
for
that
will
be
the
whole
mass
of
hieroglyphic
tales
when
the
work
is
perfected
in
the
next
place
being
very
asthmatic
and
requiring
a
free
communication
of
air
i
lodge
in
the
uppermost
story
of
a
house
in
an
alley
not
far
from
mary
axe
and
as
a
great
deal
of
good
company
lodges
in
the
same
mansion
it
was
by
a
considerable
favour
that
i
could
obtain
a
single
chamber
to
myself
which
chamber
is
by
no
means
large
enough
to
contain
the
whole
impression
for
i
design
to
vend
the
copies
myself
and
according
to
the
practice
of
other
great
men
shall
sign
the
first
sheet
my
self
with
my
own
hand
desirous
as
i
am
of
acquainting
the
world
with
many
more
circumstances
relative
to
myself
some
private
considerations
prevent
my
indulging
their
curiosity
any
farther
at
present
but
i
shall
take
care
to
leave
so
minute
an
account
of
myself
to
some
public
library
that
the
future
commentators
and
editors
of
this
work
shall
not
be
deprived
of
all
necessary
lights
in
the
mean
time
i
beg
the
reader
to
accept
the
temporary
compensation
of
an
account
of
the
author
whose
work
i
am
publishing
the
hieroglyphic
tales
were
undoubtedly
written
a
little
before
the
creation
of
the
world
and
have
ever
since
been
preserved
by
oral
tradition
in
the
mountains
of
crampcraggiri
an
uninhabited
island
not
yet
discovered
of
these
few
facts
we
could
have
the
most
authentic
attestations
of
several
clergymen
who
remember
to
have
heard
them
repeated
by
old
men
long
before
they
the
said
clergymen
were
born
we
do
not
trouble
the
reader
with
these
attestations
as
we
are
sure
every
body
will
believe
them
as
much
as
if
they
had
seen
them
it
is
more
difficult
to
ascertain
the
true
author
we
might
ascribe
them
with
great
probability
to
kemanrlegorpikos
son
of
quat
but
besides
that
we
are
not
certain
that
any
such
person
ever
existed
it
is
not
clear
that
he
ever
wrote
any
thing
but
a
book
of
cookery
and
that
in
heroic
verse
others
give
them
to
quat
nurse
and
a
few
to
hermes
trismegistus
though
there
is
a
passage
in
the
latter
treatise
on
the
harpsichord
which
directly
contradicts
the
account
of
the
first
volcano
in
the
of
the
hieroglyphic
tales
as
trismegistus
work
is
lost
it
is
impossible
to
decide
now
whether
the
discordance
mentioned
is
so
positive
as
has
been
asserted
by
many
learned
men
who
only
guess
at
the
opinion
of
hermes
from
other
passages
in
his
writings
and
who
indeed
are
not
sure
whether
he
was
speaking
of
volcanoes
or
cheesecakes
for
he
drew
so
ill
that
his
hieroglyphics
may
often
be
taken
for
the
most
opposite
things
in
nature
and
as
there
is
no
subject
which
he
has
not
treated
it
is
not
precisely
known
what
he
was
discussing
in
any
one
of
them
this
is
the
nearest
we
can
come
to
any
certainty
with
regard
to
the
author
but
whether
he
wrote
the
tales
six
thousand
years
ago
as
we
believe
or
whether
they
were
written
for
him
within
these
ten
years
they
are
incontestably
the
most
ancient
work
in
the
world
and
though
there
is
little
imagination
and
still
less
invention
in
them
yet
there
are
so
many
passages
in
them
exactly
resembling
homer
that
any
man
living
would
conclude
they
were
imitated
from
that
great
poet
if
it
was
not
certain
that
homer
borrowed
from
them
which
i
shall
prove
two
ways
first
by
giving
homer
parallel
passages
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
secondly
by
translating
homer
himself
into
prose
which
shall
make
him
so
unlike
himself
that
nobody
will
think
he
could
be
an
original
writer
and
when
he
is
become
totally
lifeless
and
insipid
it
will
be
impossible
but
these
tales
should
be
preferred
to
the
iliad
especially
as
i
design
to
put
them
into
a
kind
of
style
that
shall
be
neither
verse
nor
prose
a
diction
lately
much
used
in
tragedies
and
heroic
poems
the
former
of
which
are
really
heroic
poems
from
want
of
probability
as
an
epic
poem
is
in
fact
a
meer
tragedy
having
little
or
no
change
of
scene
no
incidents
but
a
ghost
and
a
storm
and
no
events
but
the
deaths
of
the
principal
actors
i
will
not
detain
the
reader
longer
from
the
perusal
of
this
invaluable
work
but
i
must
beseech
the
public
to
be
expeditious
in
taking
off
the
whole
impression
as
fast
as
i
can
get
it
printed
because
i
must
inform
them
that
i
have
a
more
precious
work
in
contemplation
namely
a
new
roman
history
in
which
i
mean
to
ridicule
detect
and
expose
all
ancient
virtue
and
patriotism
and
shew
from
original
papers
which
i
am
going
to
write
and
which
i
shall
afterwards
bury
in
the
ruins
of
carthage
and
then
dig
up
that
it
appears
by
the
letters
of
hanno
the
punic
embassador
at
rome
that
scipio
was
in
the
pay
of
hannibal
and
that
the
dilatoriness
of
fabius
proceeded
from
his
being
a
pensioner
of
the
same
general
i
own
this
discovery
will
pierce
my
heart
but
as
morality
is
best
taught
by
shewing
how
little
effect
it
had
on
the
best
of
men
i
will
sacrifice
the
most
virtuous
names
for
the
instruction
of
the
present
wicked
generation
and
i
can
not
doubt
but
when
once
they
have
learnt
to
detest
the
favourite
heroes
of
antiquity
they
will
become
good
subjects
of
the
most
pious
king
that
ever
lived
since
david
who
expelled
the
established
royal
family
and
then
sung
psalms
to
the
memory
of
jonathan
to
whose
prejudice
he
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
tale
new
arabian
night
at
the
foot
of
the
great
mountain
hirgonqúu
was
anciently
situated
the
kingdom
of
larbidel
geographers
who
are
not
apt
to
make
such
just
comparisons
said
it
resembled
a
football
just
going
to
be
kicked
away
and
so
it
happened
for
the
mountain
kicked
the
kingdom
into
the
ocean
and
it
has
never
been
heard
of
since
one
day
a
young
princess
had
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
gather
goat
eggs
the
whites
of
which
are
excellent
for
taking
off
goat
eggs
yes
naturalists
hold
that
all
beings
are
conceived
in
an
egg
the
goats
of
hirgonqúu
might
be
oviparous
and
lay
their
eggs
to
be
hatched
by
the
sun
this
is
my
supposition
no
matter
whether
i
believe
it
myself
or
not
i
will
write
against
and
abuse
any
man
that
opposes
my
hypothesis
it
would
be
fine
indeed
if
learned
men
were
obliged
to
believe
what
they
assert
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
was
inhabited
by
a
nation
of
whom
the
larbidellians
knew
no
more
than
the
french
nobility
do
of
great
britain
which
they
think
is
an
island
that
some
how
or
other
may
be
approached
by
land
the
princess
had
strayed
into
the
confines
of
cucurucu
when
she
suddenly
found
herself
seized
by
the
guards
of
the
prince
that
reigned
in
that
country
they
told
her
in
few
words
that
she
must
be
conveyed
to
the
capital
and
married
to
the
giant
their
lord
and
emperor
the
giant
it
seems
was
fond
of
having
a
new
wife
every
night
who
was
to
tell
him
a
story
that
would
last
till
morning
and
then
have
her
head
cut
off
such
odd
ways
have
some
folks
of
passing
their
the
princess
modestly
asked
why
their
master
loved
such
long
stories
the
captain
of
the
guard
replied
his
majesty
did
not
sleep
well
well
said
she
and
if
he
does
not
not
but
i
believe
i
can
tell
as
long
stories
as
any
princess
in
asia
nay
i
can
repeat
leonidas
by
heart
and
your
emperor
must
be
wakeful
indeed
if
he
can
hold
out
against
that
by
this
time
they
were
arrived
at
the
palace
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
princess
the
emperor
so
far
from
being
a
giant
was
but
five
feet
one
inch
in
height
but
being
two
inches
taller
than
any
of
his
predecessors
the
flattery
of
his
courtiers
had
bestowed
the
name
of
on
him
and
he
affected
to
look
down
upon
any
man
above
his
own
stature
the
princess
was
immediately
undressed
and
put
to
bed
his
majesty
being
impatient
to
hear
a
new
story
light
of
my
eyes
said
the
emperor
what
is
your
name
i
call
myself
the
princess
gronovia
replied
she
but
my
real
appellation
is
the
frow
gronow
and
what
is
the
use
of
a
name
said
his
majesty
but
to
be
called
by
it
and
why
do
you
pretend
to
be
a
princess
if
you
are
not
my
turn
is
romantic
answered
she
and
i
have
ever
had
an
ambition
of
being
the
heroine
of
a
novel
now
there
are
but
two
conditions
that
entitle
one
to
that
rank
one
must
be
a
shepherdess
or
a
princess
well
content
yourself
said
the
giant
you
will
die
an
empress
without
being
either
the
one
or
the
other
but
what
sublime
reason
had
you
for
lengthening
your
name
so
unaccountably
it
is
a
custom
in
my
family
said
she
all
my
ancestors
were
learned
men
who
wrote
about
the
romans
it
sounded
more
classic
and
gave
a
higher
opinion
of
their
literature
to
put
a
latin
termination
to
their
names
all
this
is
japonese
to
me
said
the
emperor
but
your
ancestors
seem
to
have
been
a
parcel
of
mountebanks
does
one
understand
any
thing
the
better
for
corrupting
one
name
oh
said
the
princess
but
it
shewed
taste
too
there
was
a
time
when
in
italy
the
learned
carried
this
still
farther
and
a
man
with
a
large
forehead
who
was
born
on
the
fifth
of
january
called
himself
quintus
januarius
fronto
more
and
more
absurd
said
the
emperor
you
seem
to
have
a
great
deal
of
impertinent
knowledge
about
a
great
many
impertinent
people
but
proceed
in
your
story
whence
came
you
mynheer
said
she
i
was
born
in
holland
the
deuce
you
was
said
the
emperor
and
where
is
that
it
was
no
where
replied
the
princess
spritelily
till
my
countrymen
gained
it
from
the
sea
indeed
moppet
said
his
majesty
and
pray
who
were
your
countrymen
before
you
had
any
country
your
majesty
asks
a
vey
shrewd
question
said
she
which
i
can
not
resolve
on
a
sudden
but
i
will
step
home
to
my
library
and
consult
five
or
six
thousand
volumes
of
modern
history
an
hundred
or
two
dictionaries
and
an
abridgment
of
geography
in
forty
volumes
in
folio
and
be
back
in
an
instant
not
so
fast
my
life
said
the
emperor
you
must
not
rise
till
you
go
to
execution
it
is
now
one
in
the
morning
and
you
have
not
begun
your
story
my
great
grandfather
continued
the
princess
was
a
dutch
merchant
who
passed
many
years
in
japan
on
what
account
said
the
emperor
he
went
thither
to
abjure
his
religion
said
she
that
he
might
get
money
enough
to
return
and
defend
it
against
philip
you
are
a
pleasant
family
said
the
emperor
but
though
i
love
fables
i
hate
genealogies
i
know
in
all
families
by
their
own
account
there
never
was
any
thing
but
good
and
great
men
from
father
to
son
a
sort
of
fiction
that
does
not
at
all
amuse
me
in
my
dominions
there
is
no
nobility
but
flattery
whoever
flatters
me
best
is
created
a
great
lord
and
the
titles
i
confer
are
synonimous
to
their
merits
there
is
my
favourite
lord
treasurer
head
of
the
law
and
whoever
speaks
truth
corrupts
his
blood
and
is
ipso
facto
degraded
in
europe
you
allow
a
man
to
be
noble
because
one
of
his
ancestors
was
a
flatterer
but
every
thing
degenerates
the
farther
it
is
removed
from
its
source
i
will
not
hear
a
word
of
any
of
your
race
before
your
father
what
was
he
it
was
in
the
height
of
the
contests
about
the
bull
unigenitus
i
tell
you
interrupted
the
emperor
i
will
not
be
plagued
with
any
more
of
those
people
with
latin
names
they
were
a
parcel
of
coxcombs
and
seem
to
have
infected
you
with
their
folly
i
am
sorry
replied
gronovia
that
your
sublime
highness
is
so
little
acquainted
with
the
state
of
europe
as
to
take
a
papal
ordinance
for
a
person
unigenitus
is
latin
for
the
jesuits
and
who
the
devil
are
the
jesuits
said
the
giant
you
explain
one
nonsensical
term
by
another
and
wonder
i
am
never
the
wiser
sir
said
the
princess
if
you
will
permit
me
to
give
you
a
short
account
of
the
troubles
that
have
agitated
europe
for
these
last
two
hundred
years
on
the
doctrines
of
grace
predestination
reprobation
justification
you
will
be
more
entertained
and
will
believe
less
than
if
i
told
your
majesty
a
long
story
of
fairies
and
goblins
you
are
an
eternal
prater
said
the
emperor
and
very
but
talk
your
fill
and
upon
what
subject
you
like
till
tomorrow
morning
but
i
swear
by
the
soul
of
the
holy
jirigi
who
rode
to
heaven
on
the
tail
of
a
magpie
as
soon
as
the
clock
strikes
eight
you
are
a
dead
woman
well
who
was
the
jesuit
unigenitus
the
novel
doctrines
that
had
sprung
up
in
germany
said
gronovia
made
it
necessary
for
the
church
to
look
about
her
the
disciples
of
loyola
of
whom
said
the
emperor
yawning
ignatius
loyola
the
founder
of
the
jesuits
replied
gronovia
was
a
writer
of
roman
history
i
suppose
interrupted
the
emperor
what
the
devil
were
the
romans
to
you
that
you
trouble
your
head
so
much
about
them
the
empire
of
rome
and
the
church
of
rome
are
two
distinct
things
said
the
princess
and
yet
as
one
may
say
the
one
depends
upon
the
other
as
the
new
testament
does
on
the
old
one
destroyed
the
other
and
yet
pretends
a
right
to
its
inheritance
the
temporalities
of
the
church
what
said
the
emperor
to
the
chief
eunuch
it
can
not
sure
be
far
from
eight
this
woman
has
gossipped
at
least
seven
hours
do
you
hear
my
wife
shall
be
dumb
cut
her
tongue
out
before
you
bring
her
to
our
bed
madam
said
the
eunuch
his
sublime
highness
whose
erudition
passes
the
lands
of
the
sea
is
too
well
acquainted
with
all
human
sciences
to
require
information
it
is
therefore
that
his
exalted
wisdom
prefers
accounts
of
what
never
happened
to
any
relation
either
in
history
or
divinity
you
lie
said
the
emperor
when
i
exclude
truth
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
forbid
divinity
how
many
divinities
have
you
in

woman
the
council
of
trent
replied
gronovia
has
decided
the
emperor
began
to
snore
i
mean
continued
gronovia
that
notwithstanding
all
father
paul
has
asserted
cardinal
palavicini
affirms
that
in
the
three
first
sessions
of
that
council
the
emperor
was
now
fast
asleep
which
the
princess
and
the
chief
eunuch
perceiving
clapped
several
pillows
upon
his
face
and
held
them
there
till
he
expired
as
soon
as
they
were
convinced
he
was
dead
the
princess
putting
on
every
mark
of
despair
and
concern
issued
to
the
divan
where
she
was
immediately
proclaimed
empress
the
emperor
it
was
given
out
had
died
of
an
hermorrhoidal
cholic
but
to
shew
her
regard
for
his
memory
her
imperial
majesty
declared
she
would
strictly
adhere
to
the
maxims
by
which
he
had
governed
accordingly
she
espoused
a
new
husband
every
night
but
dispensed
with
their
telling
her
stories
and
was
graciously
pleased
also
upon
their
good
behaviour
to
remit
the
subsequent
execution
she
sent
presents
to
all
the
learned
men
in
asia
and
they
in
return
did
not
fail
to
cry
her
up
as
a
pattern
of
clemency
wisdom
and
virtue
and
though
the
panegyrics
of
the
learned
are
generally
as
clumsy
as
they
are
fulsome
they
ventured
to
allure
her
that
their
writings
would
be
as
durable
as
brass
and
that
the
memory
of
her
glorious
reign
would
reach
to
the
latest
posterity
tale
ii
king
and
his
three
there
was
formerly
a
king
who
had
three
daughters
that
is
he
would
have
had
three
if
he
had
had
one
more
but
some
how
or
other
the
eldest
never
was
born
she
was
extremely
handsome
had
a
great
deal
of
wit
and
spoke
french
in
perfection
as
all
the
authors
of
that
age
affirm
and
yet
none
of
them
pretend
that
she
ever
existed
it
is
very
certain
that
the
two
other
princesses
were
far
from
beauties
the
second
had
a
strong
yorkshire
dialect
and
the
youngest
had
bad
teeth
and
but
one
leg
which
occasioned
her
dancing
very
as
it
was
not
probable
that
his
majesty
would
have
any
more
children
being
years
two
months
and
thirteen
days
old
when
his
queen
died
the
states
of
the
kingdom
were
very
anxious
to
have
the
princesses
married
but
there
was
one
great
obstacle
to
this
settlement
though
so
important
to
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
the
king
insisted
that
his
eldest
daughter
should
be
married
first
and
as
there
was
no
such
person
it
was
very
difficult
to
fix
upon
a
proper
husband
for
her
the
courtiers
all
approved
his
majesty
resolution
but
as
under
the
best
princes
there
will
always
be
a
number
of
discontented
the
nation
was
torn
into
different
factions
the
grumblers
or
patriots
insisting
that
the
second
princess
was
the
eldest
and
ought
to
be
declared
heiress
apparent
to
the
crown
many
pamphlets
were
written
pro
and
con
but
the
ministerial
party
pretended
that
the
chancellor
argument
was
unanswerable
who
affirmed
that
the
second
princess
could
not
be
the
eldest
as
no
ever
had
a
yorkshire
accent
a
few
persons
who
were
attached
to
the
youngest
princess
took
advantage
of
this
plea
for
whispering
that
royal
highness
pretensions
to
the
crown
were
the
best
of
all
for
as
there
was
no
eldest
princess
and
as
the
second
must
be
the
first
if
there
was
no
first
and
as
she
could
not
be
the
second
if
she
was
the
first
and
as
the
chancellor
had
proved
that
she
could
not
be
the
first
it
followed
plainly
by
every
idea
of
law
that
she
could
be
nobody
at
all
and
then
the
consequence
followed
of
course
that
the
youngest
must
be
the
eldest
if
she
had
no
elder
sister
it
is
inconceivable
what
animosities
and
mischiefs
arose
from
these
different
titles
and
each
faction
endeavoured
to
strengthen
itself
by
foreign
alliances
the
court
party
having
no
real
object
for
their
attachment
were
the
most
attached
of
all
and
made
up
by
warmth
for
the
want
of
foundation
in
their
principles
the
clergy
in
general
were
devoted
to
this
which
was
styled
first
the
physicians
embraced
the
second
and
the
lawyers
declared
for
the
third
or
the
faction
of
the
youngest
princess
because
it
seemed
best
calculated
to
admit
of
doubts
and
endless
litigation
while
the
nation
was
in
this
distracted
situation
there
arrived
the
prince
of
quifferiquimini
who
would
have
been
the
most
accomplished
hero
of
the
age
if
he
had
not
been
dead
and
had
spoken
any
language
but
the
egyptian
and
had
not
had
three
legs
notwithstanding
these
blemishes
the
eyes
of
the
whole
nation
were
immediately
turned
upon
him
and
each
party
wished
to
see
him
married
to
the
princess
whose
cause
they
espoused
the
old
king
received
him
with
the
most
distinguished
honours
the
senate
made
the
most
fulsome
addresses
to
him
the
princesses
were
so
taken
with
him
that
they
grew
more
bitter
enemies
than
ever
and
the
court
ladies
and
invented
a
thousand
new
fashions
upon
his
account
every
thing
was
to
be
ŕ
la
quifferiquimini
both
men
and
women
of
fashion
left
off
rouge
to
look
the
more
cadaverous
their
cloaths
were
embroidered
with
hieroglyphics
and
all
the
ugly
characters
they
could
gather
from
egyptian
antiquities
with
which
they
were
forced
to
be
contented
it
being
impossible
to
learn
a
language
that
is
lost
and
all
tables
chairs
stools
cabinets
and
couches
were
made
with
only
three
legs
the
last
howver
soon
went
out
of
fashion
as
being
very
inconvenient
the
prince
who
ever
since
his
death
had
had
but
a
weakly
constitution
was
a
little
fatigued
with
this
excess
of
attentions
and
would
often
wish
himself
at
home
in
his
coffin
but
his
greatest
difficulty
of
all
was
to
get
rid
of
the
youngest
princess
who
kept
hopping
after
him
wherever
he
went
and
was
so
full
of
admiration
of
his
three
legs
and
so
modest
about
having
but
one
herself
and
so
inquisitive
to
know
how
his
three
legs
were
set
on
that
being
the
best
natured
man
in
the
world
it
went
to
his
heart
whenever
in
a
fit
of
peevishness
he
happened
to
drop
an
impatient
word
which
never
failed
to
throw
her
into
an
agony
of
tears
and
then
she
looked
so
ugly
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
tolerably
civil
to
her
he
was
not
much
more
inclined
to
the
second
princess
in
truth
it
was
the
eldest
who
made
the
conquest
of
his
affections
and
so
violently
did
his
passion
encrease
one
tuesday
morning
that
breaking
through
all
prudential
considerations
for
there
were
many
reasons
which
ought
to
have
determined
his
choice
in
favour
of
either
of
the
other
sisters
he
hurried
to
the
old
king
acquainted
him
with
his
love
and
demanded
the
eldest
princess
in
marriage
nothing
could
equal
the
joy
of
the
good
old
monarch
who
wished
for
nothing
but
to
live
to
see
the
consummation
of
this
match
throwing
his
arms
about
the
neck
and
watering
his
hollow
cheeks
with
warm
tears
he
granted
his
request
and
added
that
he
would
immediately
resign
his
crown
to
him
and
his
favourite
daughter
i
am
forced
for
want
of
room
to
pass
over
many
circumstances
that
would
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
of
this
history
and
am
sorry
i
must
dash
the
reader
impatience
by
acquainting
him
that
notwithstanding
the
eagerness
of
the
old
king
and
youthful
ardour
of
the
prince
the
nuptials
were
obliged
to
be
postponed
the
archbishop
declaring
that
it
was
essentially
necessary
to
have
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
the
parties
being
related
within
the
forbidden
degrees
a
woman
that
never
was
and
a
man
that
had
been
being
deemed
first
cousins
in
the
eye
of
the
canon
law
hence
arose
a
new
difficulty
the
religion
of
the
quifferiquiminians
was
totally
opposite
to
that
of
the
papists
the
former
believed
in
nothing
but
grace
and
they
had
a
of
their
own
who
pretended
that
he
was
master
of
the
whole
of
grace
and
by
that
possession
could
cause
every
thing
to
have
been
that
never
had
been
and
could
prevent
every
thing
that
had
been
from
ever
having
been
we
have
nothing
to
do
said
the
prince
to
the
king
but
to
send
a
solemn
embassy
to
the
of
grace
with
a
present
of
a
hundred
thousand
million
of
ingots
and
he
will
cause
your
charming
to
have
been
and
will
prevent
my
having
died
and
then
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
a
dispensation
from
your
old
fool
at
how
thou
impious
atheistical
bag
of
drybones
cried
the
old
king
dost
thou
profane
our
holy
religion
thou
shalt
have
no
daughter
of
mine
thou
skeleton
go
and
be
buried
and
be
damned
as
thou
must
be
for
as
thou
art
dead
thou
art
past
repentance
i
would
sooner
give
my
child
to
a
baboon
who
has
one
leg
more
than
thou
hast
than
bestow
her
on
such
a
reprobate
corpse
you
had
better
give
your
infanta
to
the
baboon
said
the
prince
they
are
fitter
for
one
another
as
much
a
corpse
as
i
am
i
am
preferable
to
nobody
and
who
the
devil
would
have
married
your
but
a
dead
body
for
my
religion
i
lived
and
died
in
it
and
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
change
it
now
if
i
would
but
for
your
part
a
great
shout
interrupted
this
dialogue
and
the
captain
of
the
guard
rushing
into
the
royal
closet
acquainted
his
majesty
that
the
second
princess
in
revenge
of
the
prince
neglect
had
given
her
hand
to
a
drysalter
who
was
a
and
that
the
city
in
consideration
of
the
match
had
proclaimed
them
king
and
queen
allowing
his
majesty
to
retain
the
title
for
his
life
which
they
had
fixed
for
the
term
of
six
months
and
ordering
in
respect
of
his
royal
birth
that
the
prince
should
immediately
lie
in
state
and
have
a
pompous
funeral
this
revolution
was
so
sudden
and
so
universal
that
all
parties
approved
or
were
forced
to
seem
to
approve
it
the
old
king
died
the
next
day
as
the
courtiers
said
for
joy
the
prince
of
quifferiquimini
was
buried
in
spite
of
his
appeal
to
the
law
of
nations
and
the
youngest
princess
went
distracted
and
was
shut
up
in
a
madhouse
calling
out
day
and
night
for
a
husband
with
three
legs
tale
iii
a
fairy
from
the
french
translation
of
the
countess
daunois
for
the
entertainment
of
miss
caroline
daughter
of
lord
william
campbell
she
lived
with
her
aunt
the
countess
of
there
was
a
merchant
of
damascus
named
aboulcasem
who
had
an
only
daughter
called
pissimissi
which
signifies
waters
of
because
a
fairy
foretold
at
her
birth
that
she
would
be
one
of
concubines
azaziel
the
angel
of
death
having
transported
aboulcasem
to
the
regions
of
bliss
he
had
no
fortune
to
bequeath
to
his
beloved
child
but
the
shell
of
a
drawn
by
an
elephant
and
a
ladybird
pissimissi
who
was
but
nine
years
old
and
who
had
been
been
kept
in
great
confinement
was
impatient
to
see
the
world
and
no
sooner
was
the
breath
out
of
her
father
body
than
she
got
into
the
car
and
whipping
her
elephant
and
ladybird
drove
out
of
the
yard
as
fast
as
possible
without
knowing
whither
she
was
going
her
coursers
never
stopped
till
they
came
to
the
foot
of
a
brazen
tower
that
had
neither
doors
nor
windows
in
which
lived
an
old
enchantress
who
had
locked
herself
up
there
with
seventeen
thousand
husbands
it
had
but
one
single
vent
for
air
which
was
a
small
chimney
grated
over
through
which
it
was
scarce
possible
to
put
one
hand
pissimissi
who
was
very
impatient
ordered
her
coursers
to
fly
with
her
up
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
which
as
they
were
the
most
docile
creatures
in
the
world
they
immediately
did
but
unluckily
the
fore
paw
of
the
elephant
lighting
on
the
top
of
the
chimney
broke
down
the
grate
by
its
weight
but
at
the
same
time
stopped
up
the
passage
so
entirely
that
all
the
enchantress
husbands
were
stifled
for
want
of
air
as
it
was
a
collection
she
had
made
with
great
care
and
cost
it
is
easy
to
imagine
her
vexation
and
rage
she
raised
a
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
that
lasted
eight
hundred
and
four
years
and
having
conjured
up
an
army
of
two
thousand
devils
she
ordered
them
to
flay
the
elephant
alive
and
dress
it
for
her
supper
with
anchovy
sauce
nothing
could
have
saved
the
poor
beast
if
struggling
to
get
loose
from
the
chimney
he
had
not
happily
broken
wind
which
it
seems
is
a
great
preservative
against
devils
they
all
flew
a
thousand
ways
and
in
their
hurry
carried
away
half
the
brazen
tower
by
which
means
the
elephant
the
car
the
ladybird
and
pissimissi
got
loose
but
in
their
fall
tumbled
through
the
roof
of
an
apothecary
shop
and
broke
all
his
bottles
of
physic
the
elephant
who
was
very
dry
with
his
fatigue
and
who
had
not
much
taste
immediately
sucked
up
all
the
medicines
with
his
proboscis
which
occasioned
such
a
variety
of
effects
in
his
bowels
that
it
was
well
he
had
such
a
strong
constitution
or
he
must
have
died
of
it
his
evacuations
were
so
plentiful
that
he
not
only
drowned
the
tower
of
babel
near
which
the
apothecary
shop
stood
but
the
current
ran
fourscore
leagues
till
it
came
to
the
sea
and
there
poisoned
so
many
whales
and
leviathans
that
a
pestilence
ensued
and
lasted
three
years
nine
months
and
sixteen
days
as
the
elephant
was
extremely
weakened
by
what
had
happened
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
draw
the
car
for
eighteen
months
which
was
a
cruel
delay
to
pissimissi
impatience
who
during
all
that
time
could
not
travel
above
a
hundred
miles
a
day
for
as
she
carried
the
sick
animal
in
her
lap
the
poor
ladybird
could
not
make
longer
stages
with
no
assistance
besides
pissimissi
bought
every
thing
she
saw
wherever
she
came
and
all
was
crouded
into
the
car
and
stuffed
into
the
seat
she
had

they
were
jogging
on
with
all
this
cargo
over
mount
caucasus
when
an
immense
who
had
been
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
ladybird
wings
that
i
had
forgot
to
say
were
of
ruby
spotted
with
black
pearls
sousing
down
at

upon

swallowed

pissimissi
the
elephant
and
all
their
commodities
it
happened
that
the
belonged
to
solomon
he
let
it
out
of
its
cage
every
morning
after
breakfast
and
it
constantly
came
home
by
the
time
the
council
broke
up
nothing
could
equal
the
surprise
of
his
majesty
and
the
courtiers
when
the
dear
little
creature
arrived
with
the
elephant
proboscis
hanging
out
of
its
divine
little
bill
however
after
the
first
astonishment
was
over
his
majesty
who
to
be
sure
was
wisdom
itself
and
who
understood
natural
philosophy
that
it
was
a
charm
to
hear
him
discourse
of
those
matters
and
who
was
actually
making
a
collection
of
dried
beasts
and
birds
in
twelve
thousand
volumes
of
the
best
paper
immediately
perceived
what
had
happened
and
taking
out
of
the
of
his
breeches
a
diamond
of
his
own
turning
with
the
toothpick
made
of
the
only
unicorn
horn
he
ever
saw
he
stuck
it
into
the
elephant
snout
and
began
to
draw
it
out
but
all
his
philosophy
was
confounded
when
jammed
between
the
elephant
legs
he
perceived
the
head
of
a
beautiful
girl
and
between
her
legs
a
which
with
the
wings
extended
thirty
feet
out
of
the
windows
of
which
rained
a
torrent
of
that
had
been
placed
there
to
make
room
then
followed
the
bear
who
had
been
pressed
to
the
bales
of
gingerbread
and
was
covered
all
over
with
it
and
looked
but
uncouthly
and
the
monkey
with
a
doll
in
every
paw
and
his
pouches
so
crammed
with
that
they
hung
on
each
side
of
him
and
trailed
on
the
ground
behind
like
the
duchess
of
beautiful
breasts
solomon
however
gave
small
attention
to
this
procession
being
caught
with
the
charms
of
the
lovely
pissimissi
he
immediately
began
the
song
of
songs
extempore
and
what
he
had
seen
i
mean
all
that
came
out
of
the
throat
had
made
such
a
jumble
in
his
ideas
that
there
was
nothing
so
unlike
to
which
he
did
not
compare
all
pissimissi
beauties
as
he
sung
his
canticles
too
to
no
tune
and
god
knows
had
but
a
bad
voice
they
were
far
from
comforting
pissimissi
the
elephant
had
torn
her
best
bib
and
apron
and
she
cried
and
roared
and
kept
such
a
squalling
that
though
solomon
carried
her
in
his
arms
and
showed
her
all
the
fine
things
in
the
temple
there
was
no
pacifying
her
the
queen
of
sheba
who
was
playing
at
backgammon
with
the
and
who
came
every
october
to
converse
with
solomon
though
she
did
not
understand
a
word
of
hebrew
hearing
the
noise
came
running
out
of
her
and
seeing
the
king
with
a
squalling
child
in
his
arms
asked
him
peevishly
if
it
became
his
reputed
wisdom
to
expose
himself
with
his
bastards
to
all
the
court
solomon
instead
of
replying
kept
singing
we
have
a
little
sister
and
she
has
no
breasts
which
so
provoked
the
sheban
princess
that
happening
to
have
one
of
the
in
her
hand
she
without
any
ceremony
threw
it
at
his
head
the
enchantress
whom
i
mentioned
before
and
who
though
invisible
had
followed
pissimissi
and
drawn
her
into
her
train
of
misfortunes
turned
the
aside
and
directed
it
to
pissimissi
nose
which
being
something
flat
like
madame
de
it
stuck
there
and
being
of
ivory
solomon
ever
after
compared
his
beloved
nose
to
the
tower
that
leads
to
damascus
the
queen
though
ashamed
of
her
behaviour
was
not
in
her
heart
sorry
for
the
accident
but
when
she
found
that
it
only
encreased
the
passion
her
contempt
redoubled
and
calling
him
a
thousand
old
fools
to
herself
she
ordered
her
and
drove
away
in
a
fury
without
leaving
sixpence
for
the
servants
and
nobody
knows
what
became
of
her
or
her
kingdom

has
never
been
heard

felt

majesty

in

of
sense

in

she
lisped
with
inimitable

she
assured

that

applauded
this

choice
with

greater
encomiums

and

royal

a
arose
from
the

pushing

pressing
and
squeezing
and
punching
one
another
to
endeavour
to
be
the
first
blinded

in
the
scuffle
her
majesty
was
thrown
down
and
got
a
bump
on
her
forehead
as
big
as
a
pigeon
egg
which
set
her
a
squalling
that
you
might
have
heard
her
to

the
old
king
flew
into
a
rage
and
snatching
up
the
mace
knocked
out
the
chancellor
brains
who
at
that
time
happened
not
to
have
any
and
the
who
sat
in
a
tribune
above
to
see
the
ceremony
fell
into
a
fit
and
miscarried
of
twins
who
were
killed
by

majesty
fright
but
the
earl
of
bullaboo
great
butler
of
the
crown
happening
to
stand
next
to
the
queen
catched
up
one
of
the
dead
children
and
perceiving
it
was
a
boy
ran
down
to
the
king
and
wished
him
joy
of
the
birth
of
a
son
and
heir
the
king
who
had
now
recovered
his
sweet
temper
called
him
a
fool
and
blunderer
upon
which
phelim
a
zealous
courtier
started
up
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
accused
the
earl
of
bullaboo
of
high
treason
for
having
asserted
that
his
late
majesty
had
had
any
other
heir
than
their
present
most
lawful
and
most
religious
sovereign
queen
grata
an
impeachment
was
voted
by
a
large
majority
though
not
without
warm
opposition
particularly
from
a
celebrated
kilkennian
orator
whose
name
is
unfortunately
not
come
down
to
us
it
being
erased
out
of
the
journals
afterwards
as
the
irish
author
whom
i
copy
says
when
he
became
first
lord
of
the
treasury
as
he
was
during
the
whole
reign
of
queen
successor
the
argument
of
this
killmorackill
says
my
author
whose
name
is
lost
was
that
her
majesty
the
having
conceived
a
son
before
the
king
resignation
that
son
was
indubitably
heir
to
the
crown
and
consequently
the
resignation
void
it
not
signifying
an
iota
whether
the
child
was
born
alive
or
dead
it
was
alive
said
he
when
it
was
conceived
here
he
was
called
to
order
by
the
and
member
for
the
borough
of
corbelly
who
entered
into
a
learned
dissertation
on
embrios
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
young
queen
crying
for
her
supper
the
previous
question
for
which
was
carried
without
a
negative
and
then
the
house
being
resumed
the
debate
was
cut
short
by
the
impatience
of
the
majority
to
go
and
drink
her
majesty
health
this
seeming
violence
gave
occasion
to
a
very
long
protest
drawn
up
by
sir
archee
mac
sarcasm
in
which
he
contrived
to
state
the
claim
of
the
departed
foetus
so
artfully
that
it
produced
a
civil
war
and
gave
rise
to
those
bloody
ravages
and
massacres
which
so
long
laid
waste
the
ancient
kingdom
of
kilkenny

which
were
at
last
terminated
by
a
lucky
accident
well
known

my

to
every
body

which
he
thinks
it
his
duty
to
relate
for
the
sake
of
those
who
never
may
have
heard

these
are
his
words

his
grace
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
the
cholic
which
made
him
make
such
wry
faces
that
the
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
ran
out
of
the
room
to
send
for
a
physician
for
she
was
a
pattern
of
goodness
and
void
of
pride
while
she
was
stepped
into
the
servant
hall
to
call
somebody
according
to
the
simplicity
of
those
times
the
archbishop
pains
encreased
when
perceiving
something
on
the
which
he
took
for
a
peach

he
gulped
it
all
down
at
once
without
saying

him
and

mi

chinese
fairy
mi
li
prince
of
china
was
brought
up
by
his
godmother
the
fairy
hih
who
was
famous
for
telling
fortunes
with
a
from
that
unerring
oracle
she
assured
him
that
he
would
be
the
most
unhappy
man
alive
unless
he
married
a
princess
whose
name
was
the
same
with
her
dominions
as
in
all
probability
there
could
not
be
above
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
that
accident
had
happened
the
prince
thought
there
would
be
nothing
so
easy
as
to
learn
who
his
destined
bride
was
he
had
been
too
well
educated
to
put
the
question
to
his
godmother
for
he
knew
when
she
uttered
an
oracle
that
it
was
with
intention
to
perplex
not
to
inform
which
has
made
people
so
fond
of
consulting
all
those
who
do
not
give
an
explicit
answer
such
as
prophets
lawyers
and
any
body
you
meet
on
the
road
who
if
you
ask
the
way
reply
by
desiring
to
know
whence
you
came
mi
li
was
no
sooner
returned
to
his
palace
than
he
sent
for
his
governor
who
was
deaf
and
dumb
qualities
for
which
the
fairy
had
selected
him
that
he
might
not
instil
any
bad
principles
into
his
pupil
however
in
recompence
he
could
talk
upon
his
fingers
like
an
angel
mi
li
asked
him
directly
who
the
princess
was
whose
name
was
the
same
with
her
father
kingdom
this
was
a
little
exaggeration
in
the
prince
but
nobody
ever
repeats
any
thing
just
as
they
heard
it
besides
it
was
excusable
in
the
heir
of
a
great
monarchy
who
of
all
things
had
not
been
taught
to
speak
truth
and
perhaps
had
never
heard
what
it
was
still
it
was
not
the
mistake
of
for
that
puzzled
the
governor
it
never
helped
him
to
understand
any
thing
the
better
for
its
being
rightly
stated
however
as
he
had
great
presence
of
mind
which
consisted
in
never
giving
a
direct
answer
and
in
looking
as
if
he
could
he
replied
it
was
a
question
of
too
great
importance
to
be
resolved
on
a
sudden
how
came
you
to
know
that
said
the
prince
this
youthful
impetuosity
told
the
governor
that
there
was
something
more
in
the
question
than
he
had
apprehended
and
though
he
could
be
very
solemn
about
nothing
he
was
ten
times
more
so
when
there
was
something
he
did
not
comprehend
yet
that
unknown
something
occasioning
a
conflict
between
his
cunning
and
his
ignorance
and
the
latter
being
the
greater
always
betrayed
itself
for
nothing
looks
so
silly
as
a
fool
acting
wisdom
the
prince
repeated
his
question
the
governor
demanded
why
he
asked
the
prince
had
not
patience
to
spell
the
question
over
again
on
his
fingers
but
bawled
it
as
loud
as
he
could
to
no
purpose
the
courtiers
ran
in
and
catching
up
the
prince
words
and
repeating
them
imperfectly
it
soon
flew
all
over
pekin
and
thence
into
the
provinces
and
thence
into
tartary
and
thence
to
muscovy
and
so
on
that
the
prince
wanted
to
know
who
the
princess
was
whose
name
was
the
same
as
her
father
as
the
chinese
have
not
the
blessing
for
aught
i
know
of
having
family
surnames
as
we
have
and
as
what
would
be
their
if
they
were
so
happy
as
to
be
christians
are
quite
different
for
men
and
women
the
chinese
who
think
that
must
be
a
rule
all
over
the
world
because
it
is
theirs
decided
that
there
could
not
exist
upon
the
square
face
of
the
earth
a
woman
whose
name
was
the
same
as
her
father
they
repeated
this
so
often
and
with
so
much
deference
and
so
much
obstinacy
that
the
prince
totally
forgetting
the
original
oracle
believed
that
he
wanted
to
know
who
the
woman
was
who
had
the
same
name
as
her
father
however
remembring
there
was
something
in
the
question
that
he
had
taken
for
royal
he
always
said
king
her
the
prime
minister
consulted
the
red
book
or
which
was
oracle
and
could
find
no
such
princess
all
the
ministers
at
foreign
courts
were
instructed
to
inform
themselves
if
there
was
any
such
lady
but
as
it
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time
to
put
these
instructions
into
cypher
the
prince
impatience
could
not
wait
for
the
couriers
setting
out
but
he
determined
to
go
himself
in
search
of
the
princess
the
old
king
who
is
had
left
the
whole
management
of
affairs
to
his
son
the
moment
he
was
fourteen
was
charmed
with
the
prince
resolution
of
seeing
the
world
which
he
thought
could
be
done
in
a
few
days
the
facility
of
which
makes
so
many
monarchs
never
stir
out
of
their
own
palaces
till
it
is
too
late
and
his
majesty
declared
that
he
should
approve
of
his
son
choice
be
the
lady
who
she
would
provided
she
answered
to
the
divine
designation
of
having
the
same
name
as
her
father
the
prince
rode
post
to
canton
intending
to
embark
there
on
board
an
english
man
of
war
with
what
infinite
transport
did
he
hear
the
evening
before
he
was
to
embark
that
a
sailor
knew
the
identic
lady
in
question
the
prince
scalded
his
mouth
with
the
tea
he
was
drinking
broke
the
old
china
cup
it
was
in
and
which
the
queen
his
mother
had
given
him
at
his
departure
from
pekin
and
which
had
been
given
to
her
great
great
great
great
grandmother
queen
fi
by
confucius
himself
and
ran
down
to
the
vessel
and
asked
for
the
man
who
knew
his
bride
it
was
honest
tom
an
irish
sailor
who
by
his
interpreter
james
hall
the
supercargo
informed
his
highness
that
bob
oliver
of
sligo
had
a
daughter
christened
of
both
his
names
the
fair
miss
bob
oliver
the
prince
by
the
plenitude
of
his
power
declared
tom
a
mandarin
of
the
first
class
and
at
tom
desire
promised
to
speak
to
his
brother
the
king
of
great
ireland
france
and
britain
to
have
him
made
a
peer
in
his
own
country
tom
saying
he
should
be
ashamed
to
appear
there
without
being
a
lord
as
well
as
all
his
acquaintance
the
prince
passion
which
was
greatly
inflamed
by
tom
description
of
her
highness
bob
charms
would
not
let
him
stay
for
a
proper
set
of
ladies
from
pekin
to
carry
to
wait
on
his
bride
so
he
took
a
dozen
of
the
wives
of
the
first
merchants
in
canton
and
two
dozen
virgins
as
maids
of
honour
who
however
were
disqualified
for
their
employments
before
his
highness
got
to
helena
tom
himself
married
one
of
them
but
was
so
great
a
favourite
with
the
prince
that
she
still
was
appointed
maid
of
honour
and
with
tom
consent
was
afterwards
married
to
an
english
duke
nothing
can
paint
the
agonies
of
our
royal
lover
when
on
his
landing
at
dublin
he
was
informed
that
princess
bob
had
quitted
ireland
and
was
married
to
nobody
knew
whom
it
was
well
for
tom
that
he
was
on
irish
ground
he
would
have
been
chopped
as
small
as
rice
for
it
is
death
in
china
to
mislead
the
heir
of
the
crown
through
ignorance
to
do
it
knowingly
is
no
crime
any
more
than
in
other
countries
as
a
prince
of
china
can
not
marry
a
woman
that
has
been
married
before
it
was
necessary
for
mi
li
to
search
the
world
for
another
lady
equally
qualified
with
miss
bob
whom
he
forgot
the
moment
he
was
told
he
must
marry
somebody
else
and
fell
equally
in
love
with
somebody
else
though
be
knew
not
with
whom
in
this
suspence
he
dreamt
he
would
find
his
destined
spouse
whose
father
had
lost
the
dominions
which
never
had
been
his
dominions
in
a
place
where
there
was
a
bridge
over
no
water
a
tomb
where
nobody
ever
was
buried
nor
ever
would
be
buried
ruins
that
were
more
than
they
had
ever
been
a
subterraneous
passage
in
which
there
were
dogs
with
eyes
of
rubies
and
emeralds
and
a
more
beautiful
menagerie
of
chinese
pheasants
than
any
in
his
father
extensive
this
oracle
seemed
so
impossible
to
be
accomplished
that
he
believed
it
more
than
he
had
done
the
first
which
shewed
his
great
piety
he
determined
to
begin
his
second
search
and
being
told
by
the
lord
lieutenant
that
there
was
in
england
a
banks
who
was
going
all
over
the
world
in
search
of

did
not
know
what
his
highness
thought
he
could
not
have
a
better
conductor
and
sailed
for
england
there
he
learnt
that
the
sage
banks
was
at
oxford
hunting
in
the
bodleian
library
for
a
voyage
of
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
moon
which
banks
thought
must
have
been
in
the
western
ocean
where
the
moon
sets
and
which
planet
if
he
could
discover
once
more
he
would
take
possession
of
in
his
majesty
name
upon
condition
that
it
should
never
be
taxed
and
so
be
lost
again
to
this
country
like
the
rest
of
his
majesty
dominions
in
that
part
of
the

mi

took
a
hired
for
oxford
but
as
it
was
a
little
rotten
it
broke
on
the
new
road
down
to
henley
a
beggar
advised
him
to
walk
into
general
conway
who
was
the
most
courteous
person
alive
and
would
certainly
lend
him
his
own
chaise
the
prince
travelled
incog
he
took
the
beggar
advice
but
going
up
to
the
house
was
told
the
family
were
in
the
grounds
but
he
should
be
conducted
to
them
he
was
led
through
a
venerable
wood
of
beeches
to
a
menagerie
commanding
a
more
glorious
prospect
than
any
in
his
father
dominions
and
full
of
chinese
pheasants
the
prince
cried
out
in
extasy
oh
potent
hih
my
dream
begins
to
be
accomplished
the
gardiner
who
knew
no
chinese
but
the
names
of
a
few
plants
was
struck
with
the
similitude
of
the
sounds
but
discreetly
said
not
a
word
not
finding
his
lady
there
as
he
expected
he
turned
back
and
plunging
suddenly
into
the
thickest
gloom
of
the
wood
he
descended
into
a
cavern
totally
dark
the
intrepid
prince
following
him
boldly
after
advancing
a
great
way
into
this
subterraneous
vault
at
last
they
perceived
light
when
on
a
sudden
they
were
pursued
by
several
small
spaniels
and
turning
to
look
at
them
the
prince
perceived
their
eyes
shone
like
emeralds
and
rubies
instead
of
being
amazed
as
the
founder
of
his
race
would
have
been
the
prince
renewed
his
exclamations
and
cried
i
advance
i
advance
i
shall
find
my
bride
great
hih
thou
art
infallible
emerging
into
light
the
imperturbed
gardiner
conducted
his
highness
to
a
heap
of
artificial
ruins
beneath
which
they
found
a
spacious
gallery
or
arcade
where
his
highness
was
asked
if
he
would
not
repose
himself
but
instead
of
answering
he
capered
like
one
frantic
crying
out
i
advance
i
advance
great
hih
i
advance
the
gardiner
was
amazed
and
doubted
whether
he
was
not
conducting
a
madman
to
his
master
and
lady
and
hesitated
whether
he
should
proceed
but
as
he
understood
nothing
the
prince
said
and
perceiving
he
must
be
a
foreigner
he
concluded
he
was
a
frenchman
by
his
dancing
as
the
stranger
too
was
so
nimble
and
not
at
all
tired
with
his
walk
the
sage
gardiner
proceeded
down
a
sloping
valley
between
two
mountains
cloathed
to
their
summits
with
cedars
firs
and
pines
which
he
took
care
to
tell
the
prince
were
all
of
his
honour
the
general
own
planting
but
though
the
prince
had
learnt
more
english
in
three
days
in
ireland
than
all
the
french
in
the
world
ever
learnt
in
three
years
he
took
no
notice
of
the
information
to
the
great
offence
of
the
gardiner
but
kept
running
on
and
increased
his
gambols
and
exclamations
when
he
perceived
the
vale
was
terminated
by
a
stupendous
bridge
that
seemed
composed
of
the
rocks
which
the
giants
threw
at
jupiter
head
and
had
not
a
drop
of
water
beneath
it
where
is
my
bride
my
bride
cried
mi
li
i
must
be
near
her
the
prince
shouts
and
cries
drew
a
matron
from
a
cottage
that
stood
on
a
precipice
near
the
bridge
and
hung
over
the
river
my
lady
is
down
at
cried
the
good
woman
who
was
a
little
deaf
concluding
they
had
called
to
her
to
know
the
gardiner
knew
it
was
in
vain
to
explain
his
distress
to
her
and
thought
that
if
the
poor
gentleman
was
really
mad
his
master
the
general
would
be
the
properest
person
to
know
how
to
manage
him
accordingly
turning
to
the
left
he
led
the
prince
along
the
banks
of
the
river
which
glittered
through
the
opening
fallows
while
on
the
other
hand
a
wilderness
of
shrubs
climbed
up
the
pendent
cliffs
of
chalk
and
contrasted
with
the
verdant
meads
and
fields
of
corn
beyond
the
stream
the
prince
insensible
to
such
enchanting
scenes
galloped
wildly
along
keeping
the
poor
gardiner
on
a
round
trot
till
they
were
stopped
by
a
lonely
tomb
surrounded
by
cypress
yews
and
willows
that
seemed
the
monument
of
some
adventurous
youth
who
had
been
lost
in
tempting
the
current
and
might
have
suited
the
gallant
and
daring
leander
here
mi

first
had
presence
of
mind
to
recollect
the
little
english
he
knew
and
eagerly
asked
the
gardiner
whose
tomb
he
beheld
before
him
it
is
nobody
before
he
could
proceed
the
prince
interrupted
him
and
will
it
never
be
any
body
oh
thought
the
gardiner
now
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
of
his
phrenzy
and
perceiving
his
master
and
the
family
approaching
towards
them
he
endeavoured
to
get
the
start
but
the
prince
much
younger
and
borne
too
on
the
wings
of
love
set
out
full
speed
the
moment
he
saw
the
company
and
particularly
a
young
damsel
with
them
running
almost
breathless
up
to
lady

and
seizing
miss

cried

is
it
necessary
to
say
that

reigned

in

soul
of
orondates

that
in

city
like

a
form
like
that
of

met
with

the
cyprian
queen
not
content
with
the
numerous
oblations
of

on

altars
was
not
satisfied
while
his
heart
remained
unengaged
across

overagainst
the

of

stood
a
convent
of
carmelite
nuns
the
abbess
of
which
had
a
young
african
slave
of
the
most
exquisite
beauty
called
azora
a
year
younger
than
orondates
jet
and
japan
were
tawny
and
without
lustre
when
compared
to
the
hue
of
azora
afric
never
produced
a
female
so
perfect
as
azora
as
europe
could
boast
but
of
one
orondates
the
signora
grimaldi
though
no
bigot
was
pretty
regular
at
her
devotions
but
as
lansquenet
was
more
to
her
taste
than
praying
she
hurried
over
her
masses
as
fast
as
she
could
to
allot
more
of
her
precious
time
to
cards
this
made
her
prefer
the
church
of
the
carmelites
separated
only
by
a
small
bridge
though
the
abbess
was
of
a
contrary
faction
however
as
both
ladies
were
of
equal
quality
and
had
had
no
altercations
that
could
countenance
incivility
reciprocal
curtsies
always
passed
between
them
the
coldness
of
which
each
pretended
to
lay
on
their
attention
to
their
devotions
though
the
signora
grimaldi
attended
but
little
to
the
priest
and
the
abbess
was
chiefly
employed
in
watching
and
criticising
the
inattention
of
the
signora
not
so
orondates
and
azora
both
constantly
accompanied
their
mistresses
to
mass
and
the
first
moment
they
saw
each
other
was
decisive
in
both
breasts
venice
ceased
to
have
more
than
one
fair
in
the
eyes
of
orondates
and
azora
had
not
remarked
till
then
that
there
could
be
more
beautiful
beings
in
the
world
than
some
of
the
carmelite
nuns
the
seclusion
of
the
abbess
and
the
aversion
between
the
two
ladies
which
was
very
cordial
on
the
side
of
the
holy
one
cut
off
all
hopes
from
the
lovers
azora
grew
grave
and
pensive
and
melancholy
orondates
surly
and
intractable
even
his
attachment
to
his
kind
patroness
relaxed
he
attended
her
reluctantly
but
at
the
hours
of
prayer
often
did
she
find
him
on
the
steps
of
the
church
ere
the
doors
were
opened
the
signora
grimaldi
was
not
apt
to
make
observations
she
was
content
with
indulging
her
own
passions
seldom
restrained
those
of
others
and
though
good
offices
rarely
presented
themselves
to
her
imagination
she
was
ready
to
exert
them
when
applied
to
and
always
talked
charitably
of
the
unhappy
at
her
cards
if
it
was
not
a
very
unlucky
deal
still
it
is
probable
that
she
never
would
have
discovered
the
passion
of
orondates
had
not
her
woman
who
was
jealous
of
his
favour
given
her
a
hint
at
the
same
time
remarking
under
affectation
of
good
will
how
well
the
circumstances
of
the
lovers
were
suited
and
that
as
her
ladyship
was
in
years
and
would
certainly
not
think
of
providing
for
a
creature
she
had
bought
in
the
public
market
it
would
be
charitable
to
marry
the
fond
couple
and
settle
them
on
her
farm
in
the
country
fortunately
madame
grimaldi
always
was
open
to
good
impressions
and
rarely
to
bad
without
perceiving
the
malice
of
her
woman
she
was
struck
with
the
idea
of
a
marriage
she
loved
the
cause
and
always
promoted
it
when
it
was
honestly
in
her
power
she
seldom
made
difficulties
and
never
apprehended
them
without
even
examining
orondates
on
the
state
of
his
inclinations
without
recollecting
that
madame
capello
and
she
were
of
different
parties
without
taking
any
precautions
to
guard
against
a
refusal
she
instantly
wrote
to
the
abbess
to
propose
a
marriage
between
orondates
and
azora
the
latter
was
in
madame
capello
chamber
when
the
note
arrived
all
the
fury
that
authority

to
console
itself
with
for
being
under
restraint
all
the
asperity
of
a
bigot
all
the
acrimony
of

all
the
fictitious
rage
that
prudery
adopts
when
the
sensual
enjoyments
of
others
are
concerned
burst
out
on
the
helpless
azora
who
was
unable
to
divine
how
she
was
concerned
in
the
fatal
letter
she
was
made
to
endure
all
the
calumnies
that
the
abbess
would
have
been
glad
to
have
hurled
at
the
head
of
madame
grimaldi
if
her
own
character
and
the
rank
of
that
offender
would
have
allowed
it
impotent
menaces
of
revenge
were
repeated
with
emphasis

as
nobody
in

to
contradict

her
anger

endless
tautologies

strictly
locked
up

bread

were
ordered

cures

twenty
replies
to
madame
grimaldi
were
written
and
torn
as
not
sufficiently
expressive
of
a
resentment
that
was
rather
vociferous
than
eloquent
and
her
confessor
was
at
last
forced
to
write
one
in
which
he
prevailed
to
have
some
holy
cant
inserted
though
forced
to
compound
for
a
heap
of
irony
that
related
to
the
antiquity
of
her
family

for
many
unintelligible
allusions
to
vulgar
stories

the
most
lucid
part
of

epistle
pronounced
a
sentence
of
eternal
chastity
on
azora
not
without
some
sarcastic
expressions
against
the
promiscuous
amours
of
orondates
which
ought
in
common
decorum
to
have
banished
him
long
ago
from
the
mansion
of
a
widowed
matron
just
as
this
fulminatory
mandate
had
been
transcribed
and
signed
by

running
out
of

and
announced
to
the
venerable
assembly
that
azora
terrified
by
the
abbess
blows
and
threats
had
fallen
in
labour
and
miscarried

four

be
it
known

that
orondates
was
an

postscript
the
foregoing
tales
are
given
for
no
more
than
they
are
worth
they
are
mere
whimsical
trifles
written
chiefly
for
private
entertainment
and
for
private
amusement
half
a
dozen
copies
only
are
printed
they
deserve
at
most
to
be
considered
as
an
attempt
to
vary
the
stale
and
beaten
class
of
stories
and
novels
which
though
works
of
invention
are
almost
always
devoid
of
imagination
it
would
scarcely
be
credited
were
it
not
evident
from
the
bibliotheque
des
romans
which
contains
the
fictitious
adventures
that
have
been
written
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
that
there
should
have
been
so
little
fancy
so
little
variety
and
so
little
novelty
in
writings
in
which
the
imagination
is
fettered
by
no
rules
and
by
no
obligation
of
speaking
truth
there
is
infinitely
more
invention
in
history
which
has
no
merit
if
devoid
of
truth
than
in
romances
and
novelty
which
pretend
to
none
