a
note
from
the
digitizer
on
japanese
pronunciation
although
simplified
the
following
general
rules
will
help
the
reader
unfamiliar
with
japanese
to
come
close
enough
to
japanese
pronunciation
there
are
five
vowels
a
as
in
father
i
as
in
machine
u
as
in
fool
e
as
in
fellow
and
o
as
in
mole
although
certain
vowels
become
nearly
silent
in
some
environments
this
phenomenon
can
be
safely
ignored
for
the
purpose
at
hand
consonants
roughly
approximate
their
corresponding
sounds
in
english
except
for
r
which
is
actually
somewhere
between
r
and
l
this
is
why
the
japanese
have
trouble
distinguishing
between
english
r
and
l
and
f
which
is
much
closer
to
the
spelling
kwaidan
is
based
on
premodern
japanese
pronunciation
when
hearn
came
to
japan
the
orthography
reflecting
this
pronunciation
was
still
in
use
in
modern
japanese
the
word
is
pronounced
kaidan
there
are
many
ellipses
in
the
text
hearn
often
used
them
in
this
book
they
do
not
represent
omissions

introduction
the
publication
of
a
new
volume
of
lafcadio
hearn
exquisite
studies
of
japan
happens
by
a
delicate
irony
to
fall
in
the
very
month
when
the
world
is
waiting
with
tense
expectation
for
news
of
the
latest
exploits
of
japanese
battleships
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
present
struggle
between
russia
and
japan
its
significance
lies
in
the
fact
that
a
nation
of
the
east
equipped
with
western
weapons
and
girding
itself
with
western
energy
of
will
is
deliberately
measuring
strength
against
one
of
the
great
powers
of
the
occident
no
one
is
wise
enough
to
forecast
the
results
of
such
a
conflict
upon
the
civilization
of
the
world
the
best
one
can
do
is
to
estimate
as
intelligently
as
possible
the
national
characteristics
of
the
peoples
engaged
basing
one
hopes
and
fears
upon
the
psychology
of
the
two
races
rather
than
upon
purely
political
and
statistical
studies
of
the
complicated
questions
involved
in
the
present
war
the
russian
people
have
had
literary
spokesmen
who
for
more
than
a
generation
have
fascinated
the
european
audience
the
japanese
on
the
other
hand
have
possessed
no
such
national
and
universally
recognized
figures
as
turgenieff
or
tolstoy
they
need
an
interpreter
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
oriental
race
has
ever
had
an
interpreter
gifted
with
more
perfect
insight
and
sympathy
than
lafcadio
hearn
has
brought
to
the
translation
of
japan
into
our
occidental
speech
his
long
residence
in
that
country
his
flexibility
of
mind
poetic
imagination
and
wonderfully
pellucid
style
have
fitted
him
for
the
most
delicate
of
literary
tasks
he
has
seen
marvels
and
he
has
told
of
them
in
a
marvelous
way
there
is
scarcely
an
aspect
of
contemporary
japanese
life
scarcely
an
element
in
the
social
political
and
military
questions
involved
in
the
present
conflict
with
russia
which
is
not
made
clear
in
one
or
another
of
the
books
with
which
he
has
charmed
american
readers
he
characterizes
kwaidan
as
stories
and
studies
of
strange
things
a
hundred
thoughts
suggested
by
the
book
might
be
written
down
but
most
of
them
would
begin
and
end
with
this
fact
of
strangeness
to
read
the
very
names
in
the
table
of
contents
is
like
listening
to
a
buddhist
bell
struck
somewhere
far
away
some
of
his
tales
are
of
the
long
ago
and
yet
they
seem
to
illumine
the
very
souls
and
minds
of
the
little
men
who
are
at
this
hour
crowding
the
decks
of
japan
armored
cruisers
but
many
of
the
stories
are
about
women
and
children
the
lovely
materials
from
which
the
best
fairy
tales
of
the
world
have
been
woven
they
too
are
strange
these
japanese
maidens
and
wives
and
girls
and
boys
they
are
like
us
and
yet
not
like
us
and
the
sky
and
the
hills
and
the
flowers
are
all
different
from
ours
yet
by
a
magic
of
which
hearn
almost
alone
among
contemporary
writers
is
the
master
in
these
delicate
transparent
ghostly
sketches
of
a
world
unreal
to
us
there
is
a
haunting
sense
of
spiritual
reality
in
a
penetrating
and
beautiful
essay
contributed
to
the
atlantic
monthly
in
february
by
paul
elmer
more
the
secret
of
hearn
magic
is
said
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
in
his
art
is
found
the
meeting
of
three
ways
to
the
religious
instinct
of
india
buddhism
in
particular
which
history
has
engrafted
on
the
aesthetic
sense
of
japan
hearn
brings
the
interpreting
spirit
of
occidental
science
and
these
three
traditions
are
fused
by
the
peculiar
sympathies
of
his
mind
into
one
rich
and
novel
compound
a
compound
so
rare
as
to
have
introduced
into
literature
a
psychological
sensation
unknown
before
more
essay
received
the
high
praise
of
hearn
recognition
and
gratitude
and
if
it
were
possible
to
reprint
it
here
it
would
provide
a
most
suggestive
introduction
to
these
new
stories
of
old
japan
whose
substance
is
as
more
has
said
so
strangely
mingled
together
out
of
the
austere
dreams
of
india
and
the
subtle
beauty
of
japan
and
the
relentless
science
of
europe
march
most
of
the
following
kwaidan
or
weird
tales
have
been
taken
from
old
japanese
books
such
as
the
and
some
of
the
stories
may
have
had
a
chinese
origin
the
very
remarkable
dream
of
akinosuke
for
example
is
certainly
from
a
chinese
source
but
the
in
every
case
has
so
recolored
and
reshaped
his
borrowing
as
to
naturalize
it
one
queer
tale
was
told
me
by
a
farmer
of
chofu
in
musashi
province
as
a
legend
of
his
native
village
whether
it
has
ever
been
written
in
japanese
i
do
not
know
but
the
extraordinary
belief
which
it
records
used
certainly
to
exist
in
most
parts
of
japan
and
in
many
curious
forms
the
incident
of
was
a
personal
experience
and
i
wrote
it
down
almost
exactly
as
it
happened
changing
only
a
mentioned
by
the
japanese
narrator
tokyo
japan
january
kwaidan
the
story
of
more
than
seven
hundred
years
ago
at
in
the
straits
of
shimonoseki
was
fought
the
last
battle
of
the
long
contest
between
the
heike
or
taira
clan
and
the
genji
or
minamoto
clan
there
the
heike
perished
utterly
with
their
women
and
children
and
their
infant
emperor
likewise
now
remembered
as
antoku
tenno
and
that
sea
and
shore
have
been
haunted
for
seven
hundred
years
elsewhere
i
told
you
about
the
strange
crabs
found
there
called
heike
crabs
which
have
human
faces
on
their
backs
and
are
said
to
be
the
spirits
of
the
heike
warriors
but
there
are
many
strange
things
to
be
seen
and
heard
along
that
coast
on
dark
nights
thousands
of
ghostly
fires
hover
about
the
beach
or
flit
above
the
waves
pale
lights
which
the
fishermen
call
or
and
whenever
the
winds
are
up
a
sound
of
great
shouting
comes
from
that
sea
like
a
clamor
of
battle
in
former
years
the
heike
were
much
more
restless
than
they
now
are
they
would
rise
about
ships
passing
in
the
night
and
try
to
sink
them
and
at
all
times
they
would
watch
for
swimmers
to
pull
them
down
it
was
in
order
to
appease
those
dead
that
the
buddhist
temple
amidaji
was
built
at
akamagaseki
a
cemetery
also
was
made
close
by
near
the
beach
and
within
it
were
set
up
monuments
inscribed
with
the
names
of
the
drowned
emperor
and
of
his
great
vassals
and
buddhist
services
were
regularly
performed
there
on
behalf
of
the
spirits
of
them
after
the
temple
had
been
built
and
the
tombs
erected
the
heike
gave
less
trouble
than
before
but
they
continued
to
do
queer
things
at
intervals
proving
that
they
had
not
found
the
perfect
peace
some
centuries
ago
there
lived
at
akamagaseki
a
blind
man
named
hoichi
who
was
famed
for
his
skill
in
recitation
and
in
playing
upon
the
biwa
from
childhood
he
had
been
trained
to
recite
and
to
play
and
while
yet
a
lad
he
had
surpassed
his
teachers
as
a
professional
he
became
famous
chiefly
by
his
recitations
of
the
history
of
the
heike
and
the
genji
and
it
is
said
that
when
he
sang
the
song
of
the
battle
of
even
the
goblins
kijin
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
outset
of
his
career
hoichi
was
very
poor
but
he
found
a
good
friend
to
help
him
the
priest
of
the
amidaji
was
fond
of
poetry
and
music
and
he
often
invited
hoichi
to
the
temple
to
play
and
recite
afterwards
being
much
impressed
by
the
wonderful
skill
of
the
lad
the
priest
proposed
that
hoichi
should
make
the
temple
his
home
and
this
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
hoichi
was
given
a
room
in
the
and
in
return
for
food
and
lodging
he
was
required
only
to
gratify
the
priest
with
a
musical
performance
on
certain
evenings
when
otherwise
disengaged
one
summer
night
the
priest
was
called
away
to
perform
a
buddhist
service
at
the
house
of
a
dead
parishioner
and
he
went
there
with
his
acolyte
leaving
hoichi
alone
in
the
temple
it
was
a
hot
night
and
the
blind
man
sought
to
cool
himself
on
the
verandah
before
his
the
verandah
overlooked
a
small
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
amidaji
there
hoichi
waited
for
the
priest
return
and
tried
to
relieve
his
solitude
by
practicing
upon
his
biwa
midnight
passed
and
the
priest
did
not
appear
but
the
atmosphere
was
still
too
warm
for
comfort
within
doors
and
hoichi
remained
outside
at
last
he
heard
steps
approaching
from
the
back
gate
somebody
crossed
the
garden
advanced
to
the
verandah
and
halted
directly
in
front
of
him
but
it
was
not
the
priest
a
deep
voice
called
the
blind
man
name
abruptly
and
unceremoniously
in
the
manner
of
a
samurai
summoning
an
inferior
hoichi
hai
answered
the
blind
man
frightened
by
the
menace
in
the
voice
i
am
blind
i
can
not
know
who
calls
there
is
nothing
to
fear
the
stranger
exclaimed
speaking
more
gently
i
am
stopping
near
this
temple
and
have
been
sent
to
you
with
a
message
my
present
lord
a
person
of
exceedingly
high
rank
is
now
staying
in
akamagaseki
with
many
noble
attendants
he
wished
to
view
the
scene
of
the
battle
of
and
he
visited
that
place
having
heard
of
your
skill
in
reciting
the
story
of
the
battle
he
now
desires
to
hear
your
performance
so
you
will
take
your
biwa
and
come
with
me
at
once
to
the
house
where
the
august
assembly
is
waiting
in
those
times
the
order
of
a
samurai
was
not
to
be
lightly
disobeyed
hoichi
donned
his
sandals
took
his
biwa
and
went
away
with
the
stranger
who
guided
him
deftly
but
obliged
him
to
walk
very
fast
the
hand
that
guided
was
iron
and
the
clank
of
the
warrior
stride
proved
him
fully
armed
probably
some
on
duty
hoichi
first
alarm
was
over
he
began
to
imagine
himself
in
good
luck
for
remembering
the
retainer
assurance
about
a
person
of
exceedingly
high
rank
he
thought
that
the
lord
who
wished
to
hear
the
recitation
could
not
be
less
than
a
daimyo
of
the
first
class
presently
the
samurai
halted
and
hoichi
became
aware
that
they
had
arrived
at
a
large
gateway
and
he
wondered
for
he
could
not
remember
any
large
gate
in
that
part
of
the
town
except
the
main
gate
of
the
amidaji
kaimon
the
samurai
called
and
there
was
a
sound
of
unbarring
and
the
twain
passed
on
they
traversed
a
space
of
garden
and
halted
again
before
some
entrance
and
the
retainer
cried
in
a
loud
voice
within
there
i
have
brought
hoichi
then
came
sounds
of
feet
hurrying
and
screens
sliding
and
opening
and
voices
of
women
in
converse
by
the
language
of
the
women
hoichi
knew
them
to
be
domestics
in
some
noble
household
but
he
could
not
imagine
to
what
place
he
had
been
conducted
little
time
was
allowed
him
for
conjecture
after
he
had
been
helped
to
mount
several
stone
steps
upon
the
last
of
which
he
was
told
to
leave
his
sandals
a
woman
hand
guided
him
along
interminable
reaches
of
polished
planking
and
round
pillared
angles
too
many
to
remember
and
over
widths
amazing
of
matted
floor
into
the
middle
of
some
vast
apartment
there
he
thought
that
many
great
people
were
assembled
the
sound
of
the
rustling
of
silk
was
like
the
sound
of
leaves
in
a
forest
he
heard
also
a
great
humming
of
voices
talking
in
undertones
and
the
speech
was
the
speech
of
courts
hoichi
was
told
to
put
himself
at
ease
and
he
found
a
ready
for
him
after
having
taken
his
place
upon
it
and
tuned
his
instrument
the
voice
of
a
woman
whom
he
divined
to
be
the
rojo
or
matron
in
charge
of
the
female
service
addressed
him
saying
it
is
now
required
that
the
history
of
the
heike
be
recited
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
biwa
now
the
entire
recital
would
have
required
a
time
of
many
nights
therefore
hoichi
ventured
a
question
as
the
whole
of
the
story
is
not
soon
told
what
portion
is
it
augustly
desired
that
i
now
recite
the
woman
voice
made
answer
recite
the
story
of
the
battle
at
for
the
pity
of
it
is
the
most
deep
then
hoichi
lifted
up
his
voice
and
chanted
the
chant
of
the
fight
on
the
bitter
sea
wonderfully
making
his
biwa
to
sound
like
the
straining
of
oars
and
the
rushing
of
ships
the
whirr
and
the
hissing
of
arrows
the
shouting
and
trampling
of
men
the
crashing
of
steel
upon
helmets
the
plunging
of
slain
in
the
flood
and
to
left
and
right
of
him
in
the
pauses
of
his
playing
he
could
hear
voices
murmuring
praise
how
marvelous
an
artist
never
in
our
own
province
was
playing
heard
like
this
not
in
all
the
empire
is
there
another
singer
like
hoichi
then
fresh
courage
came
to
him
and
he
played
and
sang
yet
better
than
before
and
a
hush
of
wonder
deepened
about
him
but
when
at
last
he
came
to
tell
the
fate
of
the
fair
and
helpless
the
piteous
perishing
of
the
women
and
children
and
the
of
with
the
imperial
infant
in
her
arms
then
all
the
listeners
uttered
together
one
long
long
shuddering
cry
of
anguish
and
thereafter
they
wept
and
wailed
so
loudly
and
so
wildly
that
the
blind
man
was
frightened
by
the
violence
and
grief
that
he
had
made
for
much
time
the
sobbing
and
the
wailing
continued
but
gradually
the
sounds
of
lamentation
died
away
and
again
in
the
great
stillness
that
followed
hoichi
heard
the
voice
of
the
woman
whom
he
supposed
to
be
the
rojo
she
said
although
we
had
been
assured
that
you
were
a
very
skillful
player
upon
the
biwa
and
without
an
equal
in
recitative
we
did
not
know
that
any
one
could
be
so
skillful
as
you
have
proved
yourself
our
lord
has
been
pleased
to
say
that
he
intends
to
bestow
upon
you
a
fitting
reward
but
he
desires
that
you
shall
perform
before
him
once
every
night
for
the
next
six
nights
after
which
time
he
will
probably
make
his
august
night
therefore
you
are
to
come
here
at
the
same
hour
the
retainer
who
conducted
you
will
be
sent
for
you
there
is
another
matter
about
which
i
have
been
ordered
to
inform
you
it
is
required
that
you
shall
speak
to
no
one
of
your
visits
here
during
the
time
of
our
lord
august
sojourn
at
akamagaseki
as
he
is
traveling
incognito
he
commands
that
no
mention
of
these
things
be
made
you
are
now
free
to
go
back
to
your
temple
after
hoichi
had
duly
expressed
his
thanks
a
woman
hand
conducted
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
house
where
the
same
retainer
who
had
before
guided
him
was
waiting
to
take
him
home
the
retainer
led
him
to
the
verandah
at
the
rear
of
the
temple
and
there
bade
him
farewell
it
was
almost
dawn
when
hoichi
returned
but
his
absence
from
the
temple
had
not
been
observed
as
the
priest
coming
back
at
a
very
late
hour
had
supposed
him
asleep
during
the
day
hoichi
was
able
to
take
some
rest
and
he
said
nothing
about
his
strange
adventure
in
the
middle
of
the
following
night
the
samurai
again
came
for
him
and
led
him
to
the
august
assembly
where
he
gave
another
recitation
with
the
same
success
that
had
attended
his
previous
performance
but
during
this
second
visit
his
absence
from
the
temple
was
accidentally
discovered
and
after
his
return
in
the
morning
he
was
summoned
to
the
presence
of
the
priest
who
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
kindly
reproach
we
have
been
very
anxious
about
you
friend
hoichi
to
go
out
blind
and
alone
at
so
late
an
hour
is
dangerous
why
did
you
go
without
telling
us
i
could
have
ordered
a
servant
to
accompany
you
and
where
have
you
been
hoichi
answered
evasively
pardon
me
kind
friend
i
had
to
attend
to
some
private
business
and
i
could
not
arrange
the
matter
at
any
other
hour
the
priest
was
surprised
rather
than
pained
by
hoichi
reticence
he
felt
it
to
be
unnatural
and
suspected
something
wrong
he
feared
that
the
blind
lad
had
been
bewitched
or
deluded
by
some
evil
spirits
he
did
not
ask
any
more
questions
but
he
privately
instructed
the
of
the
temple
to
keep
watch
upon
hoichi
movements
and
to
follow
him
in
case
that
he
should
again
leave
the
temple
after
dark
on
the
very
next
night
hoichi
was
seen
to
leave
the
temple
and
the
servants
immediately
lighted
their
lanterns
and
followed
after
him
but
it
was
a
rainy
night
and
very
dark
and
before
the
could
get
to
the
roadway
hoichi
had
disappeared
evidently
he
had
walked
very
fast
a
strange
thing
considering
his
blindness
for
the
road
was
in
a
bad
condition
the
men
hurried
through
the
streets
making
inquiries
at
every
house
which
hoichi
was
accustomed
to
visit
but
nobody
could
give
them
any
news
of
him
at
last
as
they
were
returning
to
the
temple
by
way
of
the
shore
they
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
biwa
furiously
played
in
the
cemetery
of
the
amidaji
except
for
some
ghostly
fires
such
as
usually
flitted
there
on
dark
nights
all
was
blackness
in
that
direction
but
the
men
at
once
hastened
to
the
cemetery
and
there
by
the
help
of
their
lanterns
they
discovered
hoichi
sitting
alone
in
the
rain
before
the
memorial
tomb
of
antoku
tenno
making
his
biwa
resound
and
loudly
chanting
the
chant
of
the
battle
of
and
behind
him
and
about
him
and
everywhere
above
the
tombs
the
fires
of
the
dead
were
burning
like
candles
never
before
had
so
great
a
host
of
appeared
in
the
sight
of
mortal
man
hoichi
san
hoichi
san
the
servants
cried
you
are
bewitched
hoichi
san
but
the
blind
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
strenuously
he
made
his
biwa
to
rattle
and
ring
and
clang
more
and
more
wildly
he
chanted
the
chant
of
the
battle
of
they
caught
hold
of
him
they
shouted
into
his
ear
hoichi
san
hoichi
san
come
home
with
us
at
once
reprovingly
he
spoke
to
them
to
interrupt
me
in
such
a
manner
before
this
august
assembly
will
not
be
tolerated
whereat
in
spite
of
the
weirdness
of
the
thing
the
servants
could
not
help
laughing
sure
that
he
had
been
bewitched
they
now
seized
him
and
pulled
him
up
on
his
feet
and
by
main
force
hurried
him
back
to
the
temple
where
he
was
immediately
relieved
of
his
wet
clothes
by
order
of
the
priest
then
the
priest
insisted
upon
a
full
explanation
of
his
friend
astonishing
behavior
hoichi
long
hesitated
to
speak
but
at
last
finding
that
his
conduct
had
really
alarmed
and
angered
the
good
priest
he
decided
to
abandon
his
reserve
and
he
related
everything
that
had
happened
from
the
time
of
first
visit
of
the
samurai
the
priest
said
hoichi
my
poor
friend
you
are
now
in
great
danger
how
unfortunate
that
you
did
not
tell
me
all
this
before
your
wonderful
skill
in
music
has
indeed
brought
you
into
strange
trouble
by
this
time
you
must
be
aware
that
you
have
not
been
visiting
any
house
whatever
but
have
been
passing
your
nights
in
the
cemetery
among
the
tombs
of
the
heike
and
it
was
before
the
of
antoku
tenno
that
our
people
found
you
sitting
in
the
rain
all
that
you
have
been
imagining
was
illusion
except
the
calling
of
the
dead
by
once
obeying
them
you
have
put
yourself
in
their
power
if
you
obey
them
again
after
what
has
already
occurred
they
will
tear
you
in
pieces
but
they
would
have
destroyed
you
sooner
or
later
in
any
event
now
i
shall
not
be
able
to
remain
with
you
i
am
called
away
to
perform
another
service
but
before
i
go
it
will
be
necessary
to
protect
your
body
by
writing
holy
texts
upon
it
before
sundown
the
priest
and
his
acolyte
stripped
hoichi
then
with
their
they
traced
upon
his
breast
and
back
head
and
face
and
neck
limbs
and
hands
and
feet
even
upon
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
upon
all
parts
of
his
body
the
text
of
the
holy
sutra
called
when
this
had
been
done
the
priest
instructed
hoichi
saying
as
soon
as
i
go
away
you
must
seat
yourself
on
the
verandah
and
wait
you
will
be
called
but
whatever
may
happen
do
not
answer
and
do
not
move
say
nothing
and
sit
still
as
if
meditating
if
you
stir
or
make
any
noise
you
will
be
torn
asunder
do
not
get
frightened
and
do
not
think
of
calling
for
help
because
no
help
could
save
you
if
you
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
the
danger
will
pass
and
you
will
have
nothing
more
to
fear
after
dark
the
priest
and
the
acolyte
went
away
and
hoichi
seated
himself
on
the
verandah
according
to
the
instructions
given
him
he
laid
his
biwa
on
the
planking
beside
him
and
assuming
the
attitude
of
meditation
remained
quite
still
taking
care
not
to
cough
or
to
breathe
audibly
for
hours
he
stayed
thus
then
from
the
roadway
he
heard
the
steps
coming
they
passed
the
gate
crossed
the
garden
approached
the
verandah
stopped
directly
in
front
of
him
hoichi
the
deep
voice
called
but
the
blind
man
held
his
breath
and
sat
motionless
hoichi
grimly
called
the
voice
a
second
time
then
a
third
time
savagely
hoichi
hoichi
remained
as
still
as
a
stone
and
the
voice
grumbled
no
answer
that
wo
do
must
see
where
the
fellow
there
was
a
noise
of
heavy
feet
mounting
upon
the
verandah
the
feet
approached
deliberately
halted
beside
him
then
for
long
minutes
during
which
hoichi
felt
his
whole
body
shake
to
the
beating
of
his
heart
there
was
dead
silence
at
last
the
gruff
voice
muttered
close
to
him
here
is
the
biwa
but
of
the
i
see
only
two
ears
so
that
explains
why
he
did
not
answer
he
had
no
mouth
to
answer
with
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
ears
now
to
my
lord
those
ears
i
will
take
in
proof
that
the
august
commands
have
been
obeyed
so
far
as
was
possible
at
that
instant
hoichi
felt
his
ears
gripped
by
fingers
of
iron
and
torn
off
great
as
the
pain
was
he
gave
no
cry
the
heavy
footfalls
receded
along
the
verandah
descended
into
the
garden
passed
out
to
the
roadway
ceased
from
either
side
of
his
head
the
blind
man
felt
a
thick
warm
trickling
but
he
dared
not
lift
his
hands
before
sunrise
the
priest
came
back
he
hastened
at
once
to
the
verandah
in
the
rear
stepped
and
slipped
upon
something
clammy
and
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
for
he
saw
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
that
the
clamminess
was
blood
but
he
perceived
hoichi
sitting
there
in
the
attitude
of
meditation
with
the
blood
still
oozing
from
his
wounds
my
poor
hoichi
cried
the
startled
priest
what
is
this
you
have
been
hurt
at
the
sound
of
his
friend
voice
the
blind
man
felt
safe
he
burst
out
sobbing
and
tearfully
told
his
adventure
of
the
night
poor
poor
hoichi
the
priest
exclaimed
all
my
fault
my
very
grievous
fault
everywhere
upon
your
body
the
holy
texts
had
been
written
except
upon
your
ears
i
trusted
my
acolyte
to
do
that
part
of
the
work
and
it
was
very
very
wrong
of
me
not
to
have
made
sure
that
he
had
done
it
well
the
matter
can
not
now
be
helped
we
can
only
try
to
heal
your
hurts
as
soon
as
possible
cheer
up
friend
the
danger
is
now
well
over
you
will
never
again
be
troubled
by
those
visitors
with
the
aid
of
a
good
doctor
hoichi
soon
recovered
from
his
injuries
the
story
of
his
strange
adventure
spread
far
and
wide
and
soon
made
him
famous
many
noble
persons
went
to
akamagaseki
to
hear
him
recite
and
large
presents
of
money
were
given
to
him
so
that
he
became
a
wealthy
man
but
from
the
time
of
his
adventure
he
was
known
only
by
the
appellation
of
oshidori
there
was
a
falconer
and
hunter
named
sonjo
who
lived
in
the
district
called
of
the
province
of
mutsu
one
day
he
went
out
hunting
and
could
not
find
any
game
but
on
his
way
home
at
a
place
called
akanuma
he
perceived
a
pair
of
oshidori
swimming
together
in
a
river
that
he
was
about
to
cross
to
kill
oshidori
is
not
good
but
sonjo
happened
to
be
very
hungry
and
he
shot
at
the
pair
his
arrow
pierced
the
male
the
female
escaped
into
the
rushes
of
the
further
shore
and
disappeared
sonjo
took
the
dead
bird
home
and
cooked
it
that
night
he
dreamed
a
dreary
dream
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
beautiful
woman
came
into
his
room
and
stood
by
his
pillow
and
began
to
weep
so
bitterly
did
she
weep
that
sonjo
felt
as
if
his
heart
were
being
torn
out
while
he
listened
and
the
woman
cried
to
him
why
oh
why
did
you
kill
him
of
what
wrong
was
he
guilty
at
akanuma
we
were
so
happy
together
and
you
killed
him
what
harm
did
he
ever
do
you
do
you
even
know
what
you
have
done
oh
do
you
know
what
a
cruel
what
a
wicked
thing
you
have
done
me
too
you
have
killed
for
i
will
not
live
without
my
husband
only
to
tell
you
this
i
then
again
she
wept
aloud
so
bitterly
that
the
voice
of
her
crying
pierced
into
the
marrow
of
the
listener
bones
and
she
sobbed
out
the
words
of
this
poem
hi
kurureba
sasoeshi
mono
wo
akanuma
no
makomo
no
kure
no
zo
uki
at
the
coming
of
twilight
i
invited
him
to
return
with
me
now
to
sleep
alone
in
the
shadow
of
the
rushes
of
akanuma
ah
what
misery
unspeakable
and
after
having
uttered
these
verses
she
exclaimed
ah
you
do
not
know
you
can
not
know
what
you
have
done
but
when
you
go
to
akanuma
you
will
see
you
will
see
so
saying
and
weeping
very
piteously
she
went
away
when
sonjo
awoke
in
the
morning
this
dream
remained
so
vivid
in
his
mind
that
he
was
greatly
troubled
he
remembered
the
words
but
when
you
go
to
akanuma
you
will
see
you
will
see
and
he
resolved
to
go
there
at
once
that
he
might
learn
whether
his
dream
was
anything
more
than
a
dream
so
he
went
to
akanuma
and
there
when
he
came
to
the
he
saw
the
female
oshidori
swimming
alone
in
the
same
moment
the
bird
perceived
sonjo
but
instead
of
trying
to
escape
she
swam
straight
towards
him
looking
at
him
the
while
in
a
strange
fixed
way
then
with
her
beak
she
suddenly
tore
open
her
own
body
and
died
before
the
hunter
eyes
sonjo
shaved
his
head
and
became
a
priest
the
story
of
a
long
time
ago
in
the
town
of
niigata
in
the
province
of
echizen
there
lived
a
man
called
nagao
chosei
nagao
was
the
son
of
a
physician
and
was
educated
for
his
profession
at
an
early
age
he
had
been
betrothed
to
a
girl
called
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
father
friends
and
both
families
had
agreed
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
as
soon
as
nagao
had
finished
his
studies
but
the
health
of
proved
to
be
weak
and
in
her
fifteenth
year
she
was
attacked
by
a
fatal
consumption
when
she
became
aware
that
she
must
die
she
sent
for
nagao
to
bid
him
farewell
as
he
knelt
at
her
bedside
she
said
to
him
my
betrothed
we
were
promised
to
each
other
from
the
time
of
our
childhood
and
we
were
to
have
been
married
at
the
end
of
this
year
but
now
i
am
going
to
die
the
gods
know
what
is
best
for
us
if
i
were
able
to
live
for
some
years
longer
i
could
only
continue
to
be
a
cause
of
trouble
and
grief
for
others
with
this
frail
body
i
could
not
be
a
good
wife
and
therefore
even
to
wish
to
live
for
your
sake
would
be
a
very
selfish
wish
i
am
quite
resigned
to
die
and
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
will
not
grieve
besides
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
think
we
shall
meet
indeed
we
shall
meet
again
nagao
answered
earnestly
and
in
that
pure
land
there
will
be
no
pain
of
separation
nay
nay
she
responded
softly
i
meant
not
the
pure
land
i
believe
that
we
are
destined
to
meet
again
in
this
world
although
i
shall
be
buried
nagao
looked
at
her
wonderingly
and
saw
her
smile
at
his
wonder
she
continued
in
her
gentle
dreamy
voice
yes
i
mean
in
this
world
in
your
own
present
life
providing
indeed
that
you
wish
it
only
for
this
thing
to
happen
i
must
again
be
born
a
girl
and
grow
up
to
womanhood
so
you
would
have
to
wait
fifteen
sixteen
years
that
is
a
long
time
but
my
promised
husband
you
are
now
only
nineteen
years
eager
to
soothe
her
dying
moments
he
answered
tenderly
to
wait
for
you
my
betrothed
were
no
less
a
joy
than
a
duty
we
are
pledged
to
each
other
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
but
you
doubt
she
questioned
watching
his
face
my
dear
one
he
answered
i
doubt
whether
i
should
be
able
to
know
you
in
another
body
under
another
name
unless
you
can
tell
me
of
a
sign
or
token
that
i
can
not
do
she
said
only
the
gods
and
the
buddhas
know
how
and
where
we
shall
meet
but
i
am
sure
very
very
sure
that
if
you
be
not
unwilling
to
receive
me
i
shall
be
able
to
come
back
to
you
remember
these
words
of
she
ceased
to
speak
and
her
eyes
closed
she
was
dead
nagao
had
been
sincerely
attached
to
and
his
grief
was
deep
he
had
a
mortuary
tablet
made
inscribed
with
her
zokumyo
and
he
placed
the
tablet
in
his
butsudan
and
every
day
set
offerings
before
it
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
strange
things
that
had
said
to
him
just
before
her
death
and
in
the
hope
of
pleasing
her
spirit
he
wrote
a
solemn
promise
to
wed
her
if
she
could
ever
return
to
him
in
another
body
this
written
promise
he
sealed
with
his
seal
and
placed
in
the
butsudan
beside
the
mortuary
tablet
of
nevertheless
as
nagao
was
an
only
son
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
marry
he
soon
found
himself
obliged
to
yield
to
the
wishes
of
his
family
and
to
accept
a
wife
of
his
father
choosing
after
his
marriage
he
continued
to
set
offerings
before
the
tablet
of
and
he
never
failed
to
remember
her
with
affection
but
by
degrees
her
image
became
dim
in
his
memory
like
a
dream
that
is
hard
to
recall
and
the
years
went
by
during
those
years
many
misfortunes
came
upon
him
he
lost
his
parents
by
death
then
his
wife
and
his
only
child
so
that
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
world
he
abandoned
his
desolate
home
and
set
out
upon
a
long
journey
in
the
hope
of
forgetting
his
sorrows
one
day
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
arrived
at
ikao
a
still
famed
for
its
thermal
springs
and
for
the
beautiful
scenery
of
its
neighborhood
in
the
at
which
he
stopped
a
young
girl
came
to
wait
upon
him
and
at
the
first
sight
of
her
face
he
felt
his
heart
leap
as
it
had
never
leaped
before
so
strangely
did
she
resemble
that
he
pinched
himself
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
dreaming
as
she
went
and
came
bringing
fire
and
food
or
arranging
the
chamber
of
the
guest
her
every
attitude
and
motion
revived
in
him
some
gracious
memory
of
the
girl
to
whom
he
had
been
pledged
in
his
youth
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
responded
in
a
soft
clear
voice
of
which
the
sweetness
saddened
him
with
a
sadness
of
other
days
then
in
great
wonder
he
questioned
her
saying
elder
sister
so
much
do
you
look
like
a
person
whom
i
knew
long
ago
that
i
was
startled
when
you
first
entered
this
room
pardon
me
therefore
for
asking
what
is
your
native
place
and
what
is
your
name
immediately
and
in
the
unforgotten
voice
of
the
dead
she
thus
made
answer
my
name
is
and
you
are
nagao
chosei
of
echigo
my
promised
husband
seventeen
years
ago
i
died
in
niigata
then
you
made
in
writing
a
promise
to
marry
me
if
ever
i
could
come
back
to
this
world
in
the
body
of
a
woman
and
you
sealed
that
written
promise
with
your
seal
and
put
it
in
the
butsudan
beside
the
tablet
inscribed
with
my
name
and
therefore
i
came
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
she
fell
unconscious
nagao
married
her
and
the
marriage
was
a
happy
one
but
at
no
time
afterwards
could
she
remember
what
she
had
told
him
in
answer
to
his
question
at
ikao
neither
could
she
remember
anything
of
her
previous
existence
the
recollection
of
the
former
birth
mysteriously
kindled
in
the
moment
of
that
meeting
had
again
become
obscured
and
so
thereafter
remained
ubazakura
three
hundred
years
ago
in
the
village
called
asamimura
in
the
district
called
onsengori
in
the
province
of
iyo
there
lived
a
good
man
named
tokubei
this
tokubei
was
the
richest
person
in
the
district
and
the
muraosa
or
headman
of
the
village
in
most
matters
he
was
fortunate
but
he
reached
the
age
of
forty
without
knowing
the
happiness
of
becoming
a
father
therefore
he
and
his
wife
in
the
affliction
of
their
childlessness
addressed
many
prayers
to
the
divinity
fudo
myo
o
who
had
a
famous
temple
called
saihoji
in
asamimura
at
last
their
prayers
were
heard
the
wife
of
tokubei
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
the
child
was
very
pretty
and
she
received
the
name
of
tsuyu
as
the
mother
milk
was
deficient
a
called
was
hired
for
the
little
one
grew
up
to
be
a
very
beautiful
girl
but
at
the
age
of
fifteen
she
fell
sick
and
the
doctors
thought
that
she
was
going
to
die
in
that
time
the
nurse
who
loved
with
a
real
love
went
to
the
temple
saihoji
and
fervently
prayed
to
on
behalf
of
the
girl
every
day
for
days
she
went
to
the
temple
and
prayed
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
suddenly
and
completely
recovered
then
there
was
great
rejoicing
in
the
house
of
tokubei
and
he
gave
a
feast
to
all
his
friends
in
celebration
of
the
happy
event
but
on
the
night
of
the
feast
the
nurse
was
suddenly
taken
ill
and
on
the
following
morning
the
doctor
who
had
been
summoned
to
attend
her
announced
that
she
was
dying
then
the
family
in
great
sorrow
gathered
about
her
bed
to
bid
her
farewell
but
she
said
to
them
it
is
time
that
i
should
tell
you
something
which
you
do
not
know
my
prayer
has
been
heard
i
besought
that
i
might
be
permitted
to
die
in
the
place
of
and
this
great
favor
has
been
granted
me
therefore
you
must
not
grieve
about
my
death
but
i
have
one
request
to
make
i
promised
that
i
would
have
a
planted
in
the
garden
of
saihoji
for
a
and
a
commemoration
now
i
shall
not
be
able
myself
to
plant
the
tree
there
so
i
must
beg
that
you
will
fulfill
that
vow
for
me
dear
friends
and
remember
that
i
was
happy
to
die
for
sake
after
the
funeral
of
a
young
the
finest
that
could
be
found
was
planted
in
the
garden
of
saihoji
by
the
parents
of
the
tree
grew
and
flourished
and
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
second
month
of
the
following
year
the
anniversary
of
death
it
blossomed
in
a
wonderful
way
so
it
continued
to
blossom
for
two
hundred
and
years
always
upon
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
second
month
and
its
flowers
pink
and
white
were
like
the
nipples
of
a
woman
breasts
bedewed
with
milk
and
the
people
called
it
ubazakura
the
of
the
diplomacy
it
had
been
ordered
that
the
execution
should
take
place
in
the
garden
of
the
yashiki
so
the
man
was
taken
there
and
made
to
kneel
down
in
a
wide
sanded
space
crossed
by
a
line
of
or
such
as
you
may
still
see
in
japanese
his
arms
were
bound
behind
him
retainers
brought
water
in
buckets
and
filled
with
pebbles
and
they
packed
the
round
the
kneeling
man
so
wedging
him
in
that
he
could
not
move
the
master
came
and
observed
the
arrangements
he
found
them
satisfactory
and
made
no
remarks
suddenly
the
condemned
man
cried
out
to
him
honored
sir
the
fault
for
which
i
have
been
doomed
i
did
not
wittingly
commit
it
was
only
my
very
great
stupidity
which
caused
the
fault
having
been
born
stupid
by
reason
of
my
karma
i
could
not
always
help
making
mistakes
but
to
kill
a
man
for
being
stupid
is
wrong
and
that
wrong
will
be
repaid
so
surely
as
you
kill
me
so
surely
shall
i
be
avenged
out
of
the
resentment
that
you
provoke
will
come
the
vengeance
and
evil
will
be
rendered
for
if
any
person
be
killed
while
feeling
strong
resentment
the
ghost
of
that
person
will
be
able
to
take
vengeance
upon
the
killer
this
the
samurai
knew
he
replied
very
gently
almost
caressingly
we
shall
allow
you
to
frighten
us
as
much
as
you
please
after
you
are
dead
but
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
you
mean
what
you
say
will
you
try
to
give
us
some
sign
of
your
great
resentment
after
your
head
has
been
cut
off
assuredly
i
will
answered
the
man
very
well
said
the
samurai
drawing
his
long
sword
i
am
now
going
to
cut
off
your
head
directly
in
front
of
you
there
is
a
after
your
head
has
been
cut
off
try
to
bite
the
if
your
angry
ghost
can
help
you
to
do
that
some
of
us
may
be
frightened
will
you
try
to
bite
the
stone
i
will
bite
it
cried
the
man
in
great
anger
i
will
bite
it
i
will
bite
there
was
a
flash
a
swish
a
crunching
thud
the
bound
body
bowed
over
the
rice
sacks
two
long
pumping
from
the
shorn
neck
and
the
head
rolled
upon
the
sand
heavily
toward
the
it
rolled
then
suddenly
bounding
it
caught
the
upper
edge
of
the
stone
between
its
teeth
clung
desperately
for
a
moment
and
dropped
inert
none
spoke
but
the
retainers
stared
in
horror
at
their
master
he
seemed
to
be
quite
unconcerned
he
merely
held
out
his
sword
to
the
nearest
attendant
who
with
a
wooden
dipper
poured
water
over
the
blade
from
haft
to
point
and
then
carefully
wiped
the
steel
several
times
with
sheets
of
soft
paper
and
thus
ended
the
ceremonial
part
of
the
incident
for
months
thereafter
the
retainers
and
the
domestics
lived
in
ceaseless
fear
of
ghostly
visitation
none
of
them
doubted
that
the
promised
vengeance
would
come
and
their
constant
terror
caused
them
to
hear
and
to
see
much
that
did
not
exist
they
became
afraid
of
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
bamboos
afraid
even
of
the
stirring
of
shadows
in
the
garden
at
last
after
taking
counsel
together
they
decided
to
petition
their
master
to
have
a
performed
on
behalf
of
the
vengeful
spirit
quite
unnecessary
the
samurai
said
when
his
chief
retainer
had
uttered
the
general
wish
i
understand
that
the
desire
of
a
dying
man
for
revenge
may
be
a
cause
for
fear
but
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
to
fear
the
retainer
looked
at
his
master
beseechingly
but
hesitated
to
ask
the
reason
of
the
alarming
confidence
oh
the
reason
is
simple
enough
declared
the
samurai
divining
the
unspoken
doubt
only
the
very
last
intention
of
the
fellow
could
have
been
dangerous
and
when
i
challenged
him
to
give
me
the
sign
i
diverted
his
mind
from
the
desire
of
revenge
he
died
with
the
set
purpose
of
biting
the
and
that
purpose
he
was
able
to
accomplish
but
nothing
else
all
the
rest
he
must
have
forgotten
so
you
need
not
feel
any
further
anxiety
about
the
matter
and
indeed
the
dead
man
gave
no
more
trouble
nothing
at
all
happened
of
a
mirror
and
a
bell
eight
centuries
ago
the
priests
of
mugenyama
in
the
province
of
totomi
wanted
a
big
bell
for
their
temple
and
they
asked
the
women
of
their
parish
to
help
them
by
contributing
old
bronze
mirrors
for
even
in
the
courts
of
certain
japanese
temples
you
may
see
heaps
of
old
bronze
mirrors
contributed
for
such
a
purpose
the
largest
collection
of
this
kind
that
i
ever
saw
was
in
the
court
of
a
temple
of
the
jodo
sect
at
hakata
in
kyushu
the
mirrors
had
been
given
for
the
making
of
a
bronze
statue
of
amida
feet
high
there
was
at
that
time
a
young
woman
a
farmer
wife
living
at
mugenyama
who
presented
her
mirror
to
the
temple
to
be
used
for
but
afterwards
she
much
regretted
her
mirror
she
remembered
things
that
her
mother
had
told
her
about
it
and
she
remembered
that
it
had
belonged
not
only
to
her
mother
but
to
her
mother
mother
and
grandmother
and
she
remembered
some
happy
smiles
which
it
had
reflected
of
course
if
she
could
have
offered
the
priests
a
certain
sum
of
money
in
place
of
the
mirror
she
could
have
asked
them
to
give
back
her
heirloom
but
she
had
not
the
money
necessary
whenever
she
went
to
the
temple
she
saw
her
mirror
lying
in
the
behind
a
railing
among
hundreds
of
other
mirrors
heaped
there
together
she
knew
it
by
the
in
relief
on
the
back
of
it
those
three
fortunate
emblems
of
pine
bamboo
and
plumflower
which
delighted
her
when
her
mother
first
showed
her
the
mirror
she
longed
for
some
chance
to
steal
the
mirror
and
hide
it
that
she
might
thereafter
treasure
it
always
but
the
chance
did
not
come
and
she
became
very
unhappy
felt
as
if
she
had
foolishly
given
away
a
part
of
her
life
she
thought
about
the
old
saying
that
a
mirror
is
the
soul
of
a
woman
a
saying
mystically
expressed
by
the
chinese
character
for
soul
upon
the
backs
of
many
bronze
mirrors
and
she
feared
that
it
was
true
in
weirder
ways
than
she
had
before
imagined
but
she
could
not
dare
to
speak
of
her
pain
to
anybody
now
when
all
the
mirrors
contributed
for
the
mugenyama
bell
had
been
sent
to
the
foundry
the
discovered
that
there
was
one
mirror
among
them
which
would
not
melt
again
and
again
they
tried
to
melt
it
but
it
resisted
all
their
efforts
evidently
the
woman
who
had
given
that
mirror
to
the
temple
must
have
regretted
the
giving
she
had
not
presented
her
offering
with
all
her
heart
and
therefore
her
selfish
soul
remaining
attached
to
the
mirror
kept
it
hard
and
cold
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace
of
course
everybody
heard
of
the
matter
and
everybody
soon
knew
whose
mirror
it
was
that
would
not
melt
and
because
of
this
public
exposure
of
her
secret
fault
the
poor
woman
became
very
much
ashamed
and
very
angry
and
as
she
could
not
bear
the
shame
she
drowned
herself
after
having
written
a
farewell
letter
containing
these
words
when
i
am
dead
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
melt
the
mirror
and
to
cast
the
bell
but
to
the
person
who
breaks
that
bell
by
ringing
it
great
wealth
will
be
given
by
the
ghost
of
me
you
must
know
that
the
last
wish
or
promise
of
anybody
who
dies
in
anger
or
performs
suicide
in
anger
is
generally
supposed
to
possess
a
supernatural
force
after
the
dead
woman
mirror
had
been
melted
and
the
bell
had
been
successfully
cast
people
remembered
the
words
of
that
letter
they
felt
sure
that
the
spirit
of
the
writer
would
give
wealth
to
the
breaker
of
the
bell
and
as
soon
as
the
bell
had
been
suspended
in
the
court
of
the
temple
they
went
in
multitude
to
ring
it
with
all
their
might
and
main
they
swung
the
but
the
bell
proved
to
be
a
good
bell
and
it
bravely
withstood
their
assaults
nevertheless
the
people
were
not
easily
discouraged
day
after
day
at
all
hours
they
continued
to
ring
the
bell
furiously
caring
nothing
whatever
for
the
protests
of
the
priests
so
the
ringing
became
an
affliction
and
the
priests
could
not
endure
it
and
they
got
rid
of
the
bell
by
rolling
it
down
the
hill
into
a
swamp
the
swamp
was
deep
and
swallowed
it
up
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
bell
only
its
legend
remains
and
in
that
legend
it
is
called
the
or
bell
of
mugen
now
there
are
queer
old
japanese
beliefs
in
the
magical
efficacy
of
a
certain
mental
operation
implied
though
not
described
by
the
verb
nazoraeru
the
word
itself
can
not
be
adequately
rendered
by
any
english
word
for
it
is
used
in
relation
to
many
kinds
of
mimetic
magic
as
well
as
in
relation
to
the
performance
of
many
religious
acts
of
faith
common
meanings
of
nazoraeru
according
to
dictionaries
are
to
imitate
to
compare
to
liken
but
the
esoteric
meaning
is
to
substitute
in
imagination
one
object
or
action
for
another
so
as
to
bring
about
some
magical
or
miraculous
result
for
example
you
can
not
afford
to
build
a
buddhist
temple
but
you
can
easily
lay
a
pebble
before
the
image
of
the
buddha
with
the
same
pious
feeling
that
would
prompt
you
to
build
a
temple
if
you
were
rich
enough
to
build
one
the
merit
of
so
offering
the
pebble
becomes
equal
or
almost
equal
to
the
merit
of
erecting
a
temple
you
can
not
read
the
six
thousand
seven
hundred
and
volumes
of
the
buddhist
texts
but
you
can
make
a
revolving
library
containing
them
turn
round
by
pushing
it
like
a
windlass
and
if
you
push
with
an
earnest
wish
that
you
could
read
the
six
thousand
seven
hundred
and
volumes
you
will
acquire
the
same
merit
as
the
reading
of
them
would
enable
you
to
gain
so
much
will
perhaps
suffice
to
explain
the
religious
meanings
of
nazoraeru
the
magical
meanings
could
not
all
be
explained
without
a
great
variety
of
examples
but
for
present
purposes
the
following
will
serve
if
you
should
make
a
little
man
of
straw
for
the
same
reason
that
sister
helen
made
a
little
man
of
wax
and
nail
it
with
nails
not
less
than
five
inches
long
to
some
tree
in
a
at
the
hour
of
the
ox
and
if
the
person
imaginatively
represented
by
that
little
straw
man
should
die
thereafter
in
atrocious
agony
that
would
illustrate
one
signification
of
nazoraeru
or
let
us
suppose
that
a
robber
has
entered
your
house
during
the
night
and
carried
away
your
valuables
if
you
can
discover
the
footprints
of
that
robber
in
your
garden
and
then
promptly
burn
a
very
large
moxa
on
each
of
them
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
robber
will
become
inflamed
and
will
allow
him
no
rest
until
he
returns
of
his
own
accord
to
put
himself
at
your
mercy
that
is
another
kind
of
mimetic
magic
expressed
by
the
term
nazoraeru
and
a
third
kind
is
illustrated
by
various
legends
of
the
after
the
bell
had
been
rolled
into
the
swamp
there
was
of
course
no
more
chance
of
ringing
it
in
such
wise
as
to
break
it
but
persons
who
regretted
this
loss
of
opportunity
would
strike
and
break
objects
imaginatively
substituted
for
the
bell
thus
hoping
to
please
the
spirit
of
the
owner
of
the
mirror
that
had
made
so
much
trouble
one
of
these
persons
was
a
woman
called
umegae
famed
in
japanese
legend
because
of
her
relation
to
kajiwara
kagesue
a
warrior
of
the
heike
clan
while
the
pair
were
traveling
together
kajiwara
one
day
found
himself
in
great
straits
for
want
of
money
and
umegae
remembering
the
tradition
of
the
bell
of
mugen
took
a
basin
of
bronze
and
mentally
representing
it
to
be
the
bell
beat
upon
it
until
she
broke
it
crying
out
at
the
same
time
for
three
hundred
pieces
of
gold
a
guest
of
the
inn
where
the
pair
were
stopping
made
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
of
the
banging
and
the
crying
and
on
learning
the
story
of
the
trouble
actually
presented
umegae
with
three
hundred
ryo
in
gold
afterwards
a
song
was
made
about
umegae
basin
of
bronze
and
that
song
is
sung
by
dancing
girls
even
to
this
day
umegae
no
chozubachi
tataite
ga
deru
naraba
mina
san
wo
sore
tanomimasu
if
by
striking
upon
the
of
umegae
i
could
make
honorable
money
come
to
me
then
would
i
negotiate
for
the
freedom
of
all
my
after
this
happening
the
fame
of
the
became
great
and
many
people
followed
the
example
of
umegae
thereby
hoping
to
emulate
her
luck
among
these
folk
was
a
dissolute
farmer
who
lived
near
mugenyama
on
the
bank
of
the
oigawa
having
wasted
his
substance
in
riotous
living
this
farmer
made
for
himself
out
of
the
mud
in
his
garden
a
of
the
and
he
beat
the
and
broke
it
crying
out
the
while
for
great
wealth
then
out
of
the
ground
before
him
rose
up
the
figure
of
a
woman
with
long
hair
holding
a
covered
jar
and
the
woman
said
i
have
come
to
answer
your
fervent
prayer
as
it
deserves
to
be
answered
take
therefore
this
jar
so
saying
she
put
the
jar
into
his
hands
and
disappeared
into
his
house
the
happy
man
rushed
to
tell
his
wife
the
good
news
he
set
down
in
front
of
her
the
covered
jar
which
was
heavy
and
they
opened
it
together
and
they
found
that
it
was
filled
up
to
the
very
brim
with
but
no
i
really
can
not
tell
you
with
what
it
was
filled
jikininki
once
when
muso
kokushi
a
priest
of
the
zen
sect
was
journeying
alone
through
the
province
of
mino
he
lost
his
way
in
a
where
there
was
nobody
to
direct
him
for
a
long
time
he
wandered
about
helplessly
and
he
was
beginning
to
despair
of
finding
shelter
for
the
night
when
he
perceived
on
the
top
of
a
hill
lighted
by
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
one
of
those
little
hermitages
called
anjitsu
which
are
built
for
solitary
priests
it
seemed
to
be
in
ruinous
condition
but
he
hastened
to
it
eagerly
and
found
that
it
was
inhabited
by
an
aged
priest
from
whom
he
begged
the
favor
of
a
night
lodging
this
the
old
man
harshly
refused
but
he
directed
muso
to
a
certain
hamlet
in
the
valley
adjoining
where
lodging
and
food
could
be
obtained
muso
found
his
way
to
the
hamlet
which
consisted
of
less
than
a
dozen
and
he
was
kindly
received
at
the
dwelling
of
the
headman
forty
or
fifty
persons
were
assembled
in
the
principal
apartment
at
the
moment
of
muso
arrival
but
he
was
shown
into
a
small
separate
room
where
he
was
promptly
supplied
with
food
and
bedding
being
very
tired
he
lay
down
to
rest
at
an
early
hour
but
a
little
before
midnight
he
was
roused
from
sleep
by
a
sound
of
loud
weeping
in
the
next
apartment
presently
the
were
gently
pushed
apart
and
a
young
man
carrying
a
lighted
lantern
entered
the
room
respectfully
saluted
him
and
said
reverend
sir
it
is
my
painful
duty
to
tell
you
that
i
am
now
the
responsible
head
of
this
house
yesterday
i
was
only
the
eldest
son
but
when
you
came
here
tired
as
you
were
we
did
not
wish
that
you
should
feel
embarrassed
in
any
way
therefore
we
did
not
tell
you
that
father
had
died
only
a
few
hours
before
the
people
whom
you
saw
in
the
next
room
are
the
inhabitants
of
this
village
they
all
assembled
here
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
the
dead
and
now
they
are
going
to
another
village
about
three
miles
off
for
by
our
custom
no
one
of
us
may
remain
in
this
village
during
the
night
after
a
death
has
taken
place
we
make
the
proper
offerings
and
prayers
then
we
go
away
leaving
the
corpse
alone
strange
things
always
happen
in
the
house
where
a
corpse
has
thus
been
left
so
we
think
that
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
come
away
with
us
we
can
find
you
good
lodging
in
the
other
village
but
perhaps
as
you
are
a
priest
you
have
no
fear
of
demons
or
evil
spirits
and
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
left
alone
with
the
body
you
will
be
very
welcome
to
the
use
of
this
poor
house
however
i
must
tell
you
that
nobody
except
a
priest
would
dare
to
remain
here
tonight
muso
made
answer
for
your
kind
intention
and
your
generous
hospitality
i
and
am
deeply
grateful
but
i
am
sorry
that
you
did
not
tell
me
of
your
death
when
i
came
for
though
i
was
a
little
tired
i
certainly
was
not
so
tired
that
i
should
have
found
difficulty
in
doing
my
duty
as
a
priest
had
you
told
me
i
could
have
performed
the
service
before
your
departure
as
it
is
i
shall
perform
the
service
after
you
have
gone
away
and
i
shall
stay
by
the
body
until
morning
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
your
words
about
the
danger
of
staying
here
alone
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
ghosts
or
demons
therefore
please
to
feel
no
anxiety
on
my
account
the
young
man
appeared
to
be
rejoiced
by
these
assurances
and
expressed
his
gratitude
in
fitting
words
then
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
the
folk
assembled
in
the
adjoining
room
having
been
told
of
the
priest
kind
promises
came
to
thank
him
after
which
the
master
of
the
house
said
now
reverend
sir
much
as
we
regret
to
leave
you
alone
we
must
bid
you
farewell
by
the
rule
of
our
village
none
of
us
can
stay
here
after
midnight
we
beg
kind
sir
that
you
will
take
every
care
of
your
honorable
body
while
we
are
unable
to
attend
upon
you
and
if
you
happen
to
hear
or
see
anything
strange
during
our
absence
please
tell
us
of
the
matter
when
we
return
in
the
morning
all
then
left
the
house
except
the
priest
who
went
to
the
room
where
the
dead
body
was
lying
the
usual
offerings
had
been
set
before
the
corpse
and
a
small
buddhist
lamp
tomyo
was
burning
the
priest
recited
the
service
and
performed
the
funeral
ceremonies
after
which
he
entered
into
meditation
so
meditating
he
remained
through
several
silent
hours
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
deserted
village
but
when
the
hush
of
the
night
was
at
its
deepest
there
noiselessly
entered
a
shape
vague
and
vast
and
in
the
same
moment
muso
found
himself
without
power
to
move
or
speak
he
saw
that
shape
lift
the
corpse
as
with
hands
devour
it
more
quickly
than
a
cat
devours
a
rat
beginning
at
the
head
and
eating
everything
the
hair
and
the
bones
and
even
the
shroud
and
the
monstrous
thing
having
thus
consumed
the
body
turned
to
the
offerings
and
ate
them
also
then
it
went
away
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
come
when
the
villagers
returned
next
morning
they
found
the
priest
awaiting
them
at
the
door
of
the
headman
dwelling
all
in
turn
saluted
him
and
when
they
had
entered
and
looked
about
the
room
no
one
expressed
any
surprise
at
the
disappearance
of
the
dead
body
and
the
offerings
but
the
master
of
the
house
said
to
muso
reverent
sir
you
have
probably
seen
unpleasant
things
during
the
night
all
of
us
were
anxious
about
you
but
now
we
are
very
happy
to
find
you
alive
and
unharmed
gladly
we
would
have
stayed
with
you
if
it
had
been
possible
but
the
law
of
our
village
as
i
told
you
last
evening
obliges
us
to
quit
our
houses
after
a
death
has
taken
place
and
to
leave
the
corpse
alone
whenever
this
law
has
been
broken
heretofore
some
great
misfortune
has
followed
whenever
it
is
obeyed
we
find
that
the
corpse
and
the
offerings
disappear
during
our
absence
perhaps
you
have
seen
the
cause
then
muso
told
of
the
dim
and
awful
shape
that
had
entered
the
to
devour
the
body
and
the
offerings
no
person
seemed
to
be
surprised
by
his
narration
and
the
master
of
the
house
observed
what
you
have
told
us
reverend
sir
agrees
with
what
has
been
said
about
this
matter
from
ancient
time
muso
then
inquired
does
not
the
priest
on
the
hill
sometimes
perform
the
funeral
service
for
your
dead
what
priest
the
young
man
asked
the
priest
who
yesterday
evening
directed
me
to
this
village
answered
muso
i
called
at
his
anjitsu
on
the
hill
yonder
he
refused
me
lodging
but
told
me
the
way
here
the
listeners
looked
at
each
other
as
in
astonishment
and
after
a
moment
of
silence
the
master
of
the
house
said
reverend
sir
there
is
no
priest
and
there
is
no
anjitsu
on
the
hill
for
the
time
of
many
generations
there
has
not
been
any
in
this
neighborhood
muso
said
nothing
more
on
the
subject
for
it
was
evident
that
his
kind
hosts
supposed
him
to
have
been
deluded
by
some
goblin
but
after
having
bidden
them
farewell
and
obtained
all
necessary
information
as
to
his
road
he
determined
to
look
again
for
the
hermitage
on
the
hill
and
so
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
really
been
deceived
he
found
the
anjitsu
without
any
difficulty
and
this
time
its
aged
occupant
invited
him
to
enter
when
he
had
done
so
the
hermit
humbly
bowed
down
before
him
exclaiming
ah
i
am
ashamed
i
am
very
much
ashamed
i
am
exceedingly
ashamed
you
need
not
be
ashamed
for
having
refused
me
shelter
said
muso
you
directed
me
to
the
village
yonder
where
i
was
very
kindly
treated
and
i
thank
you
for
that
favor
i
can
give
no
man
shelter
the
recluse
made
answer
and
it
is
not
for
the
refusal
that
i
am
ashamed
i
am
ashamed
only
that
you
should
have
seen
me
in
my
real
shape
for
it
was
i
who
devoured
the
corpse
and
the
offerings
last
night
before
your
eyes
know
reverend
sir
that
i
am
a
jikininki
an
eater
of
human
flesh
have
pity
upon
me
and
suffer
me
to
confess
the
secret
fault
by
which
i
became
reduced
to
this
condition
a
long
long
time
ago
i
was
a
priest
in
this
desolate
region
there
was
no
other
priest
for
many
leagues
around
so
in
that
time
the
bodies
of
the
who
died
used
to
be
brought
here
sometimes
from
great
distances
in
order
that
i
might
repeat
over
them
the
holy
service
but
i
repeated
the
service
and
performed
the
rites
only
as
a
matter
of
business
i
thought
only
of
the
food
and
the
clothes
that
my
sacred
profession
enabled
me
to
gain
and
because
of
this
selfish
impiety
i
was
reborn
immediately
after
my
death
into
the
state
of
a
jikininki
since
then
i
have
been
obliged
to
feed
upon
the
corpses
of
the
people
who
die
in
this
district
every
one
of
them
i
must
devour
in
the
way
that
you
saw
last
night
now
reverend
sir
let
me
beseech
you
to
perform
a
for
me
help
me
by
your
prayers
i
entreat
you
so
that
i
may
be
soon
able
to
escape
from
this
horrible
state
of
existence
no
sooner
had
the
hermit
uttered
this
petition
than
he
disappeared
and
the
hermitage
also
disappeared
at
the
same
instant
and
muso
kokushi
found
himself
kneeling
alone
in
the
high
grass
beside
an
ancient
and
tomb
of
the
form
called
which
seemed
to
be
the
tomb
of
a
priest
mujina
on
the
akasaka
road
in
tokyo
there
is
a
slope
called
which
means
the
slope
of
the
province
of
kii
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
called
the
slope
of
the
province
of
kii
on
one
side
of
this
slope
you
see
an
ancient
moat
deep
and
very
wide
with
high
green
banks
rising
up
to
some
place
of
gardens
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
extend
the
long
and
lofty
walls
of
an
imperial
palace
before
the
era
of
and
jinrikishas
this
neighborhood
was
very
lonesome
after
dark
and
belated
pedestrians
would
go
miles
out
of
their
way
rather
than
mount
the
alone
after
sunset
all
because
of
a
mujina
that
used
to
walk
there
the
last
man
who
saw
the
mujina
was
an
old
merchant
of
the
kyobashi
quarter
who
died
about
thirty
years
ago
this
is
the
story
as
he
told
it
one
night
at
a
late
hour
he
was
hurrying
up
the
when
he
perceived
a
woman
crouching
by
the
moat
all
alone
and
weeping
bitterly
fearing
that
she
intended
to
drown
herself
he
stopped
to
offer
her
any
assistance
or
consolation
in
his
power
she
appeared
to
be
a
slight
and
graceful
person
handsomely
dressed
and
her
hair
was
arranged
like
that
of
a
young
girl
of
good
family
he
exclaimed
approaching
her
do
not
cry
like
that
tell
me
what
the
trouble
is
and
if
there
be
any
way
to
help
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
you
he
really
meant
what
he
said
for
he
was
a
very
kind
man
but
she
continued
to
weep
hiding
her
face
from
him
with
one
of
her
long
sleeves
he
said
again
as
gently
as
he
could
please
please
listen
to
me
this
is
no
place
for
a
young
lady
at
night
do
not
cry
i
implore
you
only
tell
me
how
i
may
be
of
some
help
to
you
slowly
she
rose
up
but
turned
her
back
to
him
and
continued
to
moan
and
sob
behind
her
sleeve
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
upon
her
shoulder
and
pleaded
listen
to
me
just
for
one
little
moment
then
that
turned
around
and
dropped
her
sleeve
and
stroked
her
face
with
her
hand
and
the
man
saw
that
she
had
no
eyes
or
nose
or
mouth
and
he
screamed
and
ran
away
up
he
ran
and
ran
and
all
was
black
and
empty
before
him
on
and
on
he
ran
never
daring
to
look
back
and
at
last
he
saw
a
lantern
so
far
away
that
it
looked
like
the
gleam
of
a
firefly
and
he
made
for
it
it
proved
to
be
only
the
lantern
of
an
itinerant
who
had
set
down
his
stand
by
the
but
any
light
and
any
human
companionship
was
good
after
that
experience
and
he
flung
himself
down
at
the
feet
of
the
crying
out
ah
aa
aa
kore
kore
roughly
exclaimed
the
here
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anybody
hurt
you
no
nobody
hurt
me
panted
the
other
only
ah
aa
only
scared
you
queried
the
peddler
unsympathetically
robbers
not
robbers
not
robbers
gasped
the
terrified
man
i
saw
i
saw
a
woman
by
the
moat
and
she
showed
me
ah
i
can
not
tell
you
what
she
showed
me
he
was
it
anything
like
this
that
she
showed
you
cried
the
stroking
his
own
face
which
therewith
became
like
unto
an
egg
and
simultaneously
the
light
went
out
nearly
five
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
samurai
named
isogai
heidazaemon
taketsura
in
the
service
of
the
lord
kikuji
of
kyushu
this
isogai
had
inherited
from
many
warlike
ancestors
a
natural
aptitude
for
military
exercises
and
extraordinary
strength
while
yet
a
boy
he
had
surpassed
his
teachers
in
the
art
of
swordsmanship
in
archery
and
in
the
use
of
the
spear
and
had
displayed
all
the
capacities
of
a
daring
and
skillful
soldier
afterwards
in
the
time
of
the
eikyo
war
he
so
distinguished
himself
that
high
honors
were
bestowed
upon
him
but
when
the
house
of
kikuji
came
to
ruin
isogai
found
himself
without
a
master
he
might
then
easily
have
obtained
service
under
another
daimyo
but
as
he
had
never
sought
distinction
for
his
own
sake
alone
and
as
his
heart
remained
true
to
his
former
lord
he
preferred
to
give
up
the
world
so
he
cut
off
his
hair
and
became
a
traveling
priest
taking
the
buddhist
name
of
kwairyo
but
always
under
the
koromo
of
the
priest
kwairyo
kept
warm
within
him
the
heart
of
the
samurai
as
in
other
years
he
had
laughed
at
peril
so
now
also
he
scorned
danger
and
in
all
weathers
and
all
seasons
he
journeyed
to
preach
the
good
law
in
places
where
no
other
priest
would
have
dared
to
go
for
that
age
was
an
age
of
violence
and
disorder
and
upon
the
highways
there
was
no
security
for
the
solitary
traveler
even
if
he
happened
to
be
a
priest
in
the
course
of
his
first
long
journey
kwairyo
had
occasion
to
visit
the
province
of
kai
one
evening
as
he
was
traveling
through
the
mountains
of
that
province
darkness
overcame
him
in
a
very
lonesome
district
leagues
away
from
any
village
so
he
resigned
himself
to
pass
the
night
under
the
stars
and
having
found
a
suitable
grassy
spot
by
the
roadside
he
lay
down
there
and
prepared
to
sleep
he
had
always
welcomed
discomfort
and
even
a
bare
rock
was
for
him
a
good
bed
when
nothing
better
could
be
found
and
the
root
of
a
an
excellent
pillow
his
body
was
iron
and
he
never
troubled
himself
about
dews
or
rain
or
frost
or
snow
scarcely
had
he
lain
down
when
a
man
came
along
the
road
carrying
an
axe
and
a
great
bundle
of
chopped
wood
this
woodcutter
halted
on
seeing
kwairyo
lying
down
and
after
a
moment
of
silent
observation
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
what
kind
of
a
man
can
you
be
good
sir
that
you
dare
to
lie
down
alone
in
such
a
place
as
this
there
are
haunters
about
here
many
of
them
are
you
not
afraid
of
hairy
things
my
friend
cheerfully
answered
kwairyo
i
am
only
a
wandering
priest
a
as
folks
call
it
and
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
hairy
things
if
you
mean
or
or
any
creatures
of
that
kind
as
for
lonesome
places
i
like
them
they
are
suitable
for
meditation
i
am
accustomed
to
sleeping
in
the
open
air
and
i
have
learned
never
to
be
anxious
about
my
life
you
must
be
indeed
a
brave
man
sir
priest
the
peasant
responded
to
lie
down
here
this
place
has
a
bad
name
a
very
bad
name
but
as
the
proverb
has
it
kunshi
ayayuki
ni
chikayorazu
superior
man
does
not
needlessly
expose
himself
to
peril
and
i
must
assure
you
sir
that
it
is
very
dangerous
to
sleep
here
therefore
although
my
house
is
only
a
wretched
thatched
hut
let
me
beg
of
you
to
come
home
with
me
at
once
in
the
way
of
food
i
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
there
is
a
roof
at
least
and
you
can
sleep
under
it
without
risk
he
spoke
earnestly
and
kwairyo
liking
the
kindly
tone
of
the
man
accepted
this
modest
offer
the
woodcutter
guided
him
along
a
narrow
path
leading
up
from
the
main
road
through
it
was
a
rough
and
dangerous
path
sometimes
skirting
precipices
sometimes
offering
nothing
but
a
network
of
slippery
roots
for
the
foot
to
rest
upon
sometimes
winding
over
or
between
masses
of
jagged
rock
but
at
last
kwairyo
found
himself
upon
a
cleared
space
at
the
top
of
a
hill
with
a
full
moon
shining
overhead
and
he
saw
before
him
a
small
thatched
cottage
cheerfully
lighted
from
within
the
woodcutter
led
him
to
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
whither
water
had
been
conducted
through
from
some
neighboring
stream
and
the
two
men
washed
their
feet
beyond
the
shed
was
a
vegetable
garden
and
a
grove
of
cedars
and
bamboos
and
beyond
the
trees
appeared
the
glimmer
of
a
cascade
pouring
from
some
loftier
height
and
swaying
in
the
moonshine
like
a
long
white
robe
as
kwairyo
entered
the
cottage
with
his
guide
he
perceived
four
persons
men
and
women
warming
their
hands
at
a
little
fire
kindled
in
the
ro
of
the
principle
apartment
they
bowed
low
to
the
priest
and
greeted
him
in
the
most
respectful
manner
kwairyo
wondered
that
persons
so
poor
and
dwelling
in
such
a
solitude
should
be
aware
of
the
polite
forms
of
greeting
these
are
good
people
he
thought
to
himself
and
they
must
have
been
taught
by
some
one
well
acquainted
with
the
rules
of
propriety
then
turning
to
his
host
the
aruji
or
as
the
others
called
him
kwairyo
said
from
the
kindness
of
your
speech
and
from
the
very
polite
welcome
given
me
by
your
household
i
imagine
that
you
have
not
always
been
a
woodcutter
perhaps
you
formerly
belonged
to
one
of
the
upper
classes
smiling
the
woodcutter
answered
sir
you
are
not
mistaken
though
now
living
as
you
find
me
i
was
once
a
person
of
some
distinction
my
story
is
the
story
of
a
ruined
life
ruined
by
my
own
fault
i
used
to
be
in
the
service
of
a
daimyo
and
my
rank
in
that
service
was
not
inconsiderable
but
i
loved
women
and
wine
too
well
and
under
the
influence
of
passion
i
acted
wickedly
my
selfishness
brought
about
the
ruin
of
our
house
and
caused
the
death
of
many
persons
retribution
followed
me
and
i
long
remained
a
fugitive
in
the
land
now
i
often
pray
that
i
may
be
able
to
make
some
atonement
for
the
evil
which
i
did
and
to
reestablish
the
ancestral
home
but
i
fear
that
i
shall
never
find
any
way
of
so
doing
nevertheless
i
try
to
overcome
the
karma
of
my
errors
by
sincere
repentance
and
by
helping
as
far
as
i
can
those
who
are
unfortunate
kwairyo
was
pleased
by
this
announcement
of
good
resolve
and
he
said
to
the
aruji
my
friend
i
have
had
occasion
to
observe
that
man
prone
to
folly
in
their
youth
may
in
after
years
become
very
earnest
in
right
living
in
the
holy
sutras
it
is
written
that
those
strongest
in
can
become
by
power
of
good
resolve
the
strongest
in
i
do
not
doubt
that
you
have
a
good
heart
and
i
hope
that
better
fortune
will
come
to
you
i
shall
recite
the
sutras
for
your
sake
and
pray
that
you
may
obtain
the
force
to
overcome
the
karma
of
any
past
errors
with
these
assurances
kwairyo
bade
the
aruji
and
his
host
showed
him
to
a
very
small
where
a
bed
had
been
made
ready
then
all
went
to
sleep
except
the
priest
who
began
to
read
the
sutras
by
the
light
of
a
paper
lantern
until
a
late
hour
he
continued
to
read
and
pray
then
he
opened
a
little
window
in
his
little
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
landscape
before
lying
down
the
night
was
beautiful
there
was
no
cloud
in
the
sky
there
was
no
wind
and
the
strong
moonlight
threw
down
sharp
black
shadows
of
foliage
and
glittered
on
the
dews
of
the
garden
shrillings
of
crickets
and
made
a
musical
tumult
and
the
sound
of
the
neighboring
cascade
deepened
with
the
night
kwairyo
felt
thirsty
as
he
listened
to
the
noise
of
the
water
and
remembering
the
bamboo
aqueduct
at
the
rear
of
the
house
he
thought
that
he
could
go
there
and
get
a
drink
without
disturbing
the
sleeping
household
very
gently
he
pushed
apart
the
that
separated
his
room
from
the
main
apartment
and
he
saw
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
five
recumbent
bodies
without
heads
for
one
instant
he
stood
bewildered
imagining
a
crime
but
in
another
moment
he
perceived
that
there
was
no
blood
and
that
the
headless
necks
did
not
look
as
if
they
had
been
cut
then
he
thought
to
himself
either
this
is
an
illusion
made
by
goblins
or
i
have
been
lured
into
the
dwelling
of
a
in
the
book
soshinki
it
is
written
that
if
one
find
the
body
of
a
without
its
head
and
remove
the
body
to
another
place
the
head
will
never
be
able
to
join
itself
again
to
the
neck
and
the
book
further
says
that
when
the
head
comes
back
and
finds
that
its
body
has
been
moved
it
will
strike
itself
upon
the
floor
three
times
bounding
like
a
ball
and
will
pant
as
in
great
fear
and
presently
die
now
if
these
be
they
mean
me
no
good
so
i
shall
be
justified
in
following
the
instructions
of
the
he
seized
the
body
of
the
aruji
by
the
feet
pulled
it
to
the
window
and
pushed
it
out
then
he
went
to
the
which
he
found
barred
and
he
surmised
that
the
heads
had
made
their
exit
through
the
in
the
roof
which
had
been
left
open
gently
unbarring
the
door
he
made
his
way
to
the
garden
and
proceeded
with
all
possible
caution
to
the
grove
beyond
it
he
heard
voices
talking
in
the
grove
and
he
went
in
the
direction
of
the
voices
stealing
from
shadow
to
shadow
until
he
reached
a
good
then
from
behind
a
trunk
he
caught
sight
of
the
heads
all
five
of
them
flitting
about
and
chatting
as
they
flitted
they
were
eating
worms
and
insects
which
they
found
on
the
ground
or
among
the
trees
presently
the
head
of
the
aruji
stopped
eating
and
said
ah
that
traveling
priest
who
came
how
fat
all
his
body
is
when
we
shall
have
eaten
him
our
bellies
will
be
well
filled
i
was
foolish
to
talk
to
him
as
i
did
it
only
set
him
to
reciting
the
sutras
on
behalf
of
my
soul
to
go
near
him
while
he
is
reciting
would
be
difficult
and
we
can
not
touch
him
so
long
as
he
is
praying
but
as
it
is
now
nearly
morning
perhaps
he
has
gone
to
sleep
some
one
of
you
go
to
the
house
and
see
what
the
fellow
is
doing
another
head
the
head
of
a
young
woman
immediately
rose
up
and
flitted
to
the
house
lightly
as
a
bat
after
a
few
minutes
it
came
back
and
cried
out
huskily
in
a
tone
of
great
alarm
that
traveling
priest
is
not
in
the
house
he
is
gone
but
that
is
not
the
worst
of
the
matter
he
has
taken
the
body
of
our
aruji
and
i
do
not
know
where
he
has
put
it
at
this
announcement
the
head
of
the
aruji
distinctly
visible
in
the
moonlight
assumed
a
frightful
aspect
its
eyes
opened
monstrously
its
hair
stood
up
bristling
and
its
teeth
gnashed
then
a
cry
burst
from
its
lips
and
weeping
tears
of
rage
it
exclaimed
since
my
body
has
been
moved
to
rejoin
it
is
not
possible
then
i
must
die
and
all
through
the
work
of
that
priest
before
i
die
i
will
get
at
that
priest
i
will
tear
him
i
will
devour
him
and
there
he
is
behind
that
tree
hiding
behind
that
tree
see
him
the
fat
coward
in
the
same
moment
the
head
of
the
aruji
followed
by
the
other
four
heads
sprang
at
kwairyo
but
the
strong
priest
had
already
armed
himself
by
plucking
up
a
young
tree
and
with
that
tree
he
struck
the
heads
as
they
came
knocking
them
from
him
with
tremendous
blows
four
of
them
fled
away
but
the
head
of
the
aruji
though
battered
again
and
again
desperately
continued
to
bound
at
the
priest
and
at
last
caught
him
by
the
left
sleeve
of
his
robe
kwairyo
however
as
quickly
gripped
the
head
by
its
topknot
and
repeatedly
struck
it
it
did
not
release
its
hold
but
it
uttered
a
long
moan
and
thereafter
ceased
to
struggle
it
was
dead
but
its
teeth
still
held
the
sleeve
and
for
all
his
great
strength
kwairyo
could
not
force
open
the
jaws
with
the
head
still
hanging
to
his
sleeve
he
went
back
to
the
house
and
there
caught
sight
of
the
other
four
squatting
together
with
their
bruised
and
bleeding
heads
reunited
to
their
bodies
but
when
they
perceived
him
at
the
all
screamed
the
priest
the
priest
and
fled
through
the
other
doorway
out
into
the
woods
eastward
the
sky
was
brightening
day
was
about
to
dawn
and
kwairyo
knew
that
the
power
of
the
goblins
was
limited
to
the
hours
of
darkness
he
looked
at
the
head
clinging
to
his
sleeve
its
face
all
fouled
with
blood
and
foam
and
clay
and
he
laughed
aloud
as
he
thought
to
himself
what
a
miyage
the
head
of
a
goblin
after
which
he
gathered
together
his
few
belongings
and
leisurely
descended
the
mountain
to
continue
his
journey
right
on
he
journeyed
until
he
came
to
suwa
in
shinano
and
into
the
main
street
of
suwa
he
solemnly
strode
with
the
head
dangling
at
his
elbow
then
woman
fainted
and
children
screamed
and
ran
away
and
there
was
a
great
crowding
and
clamoring
until
the
torite
as
the
police
in
those
days
were
called
seized
the
priest
and
took
him
to
jail
for
they
supposed
the
head
to
be
the
head
of
a
murdered
man
who
in
the
moment
of
being
killed
had
caught
the
murderer
sleeve
in
his
teeth
as
the
kwairyo
he
only
smiled
and
said
nothing
when
they
questioned
him
so
after
having
passed
a
night
in
prison
he
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
of
the
district
then
he
was
ordered
to
explain
how
he
a
priest
had
been
found
with
the
head
of
a
man
fastened
to
his
sleeve
and
why
he
had
dared
thus
shamelessly
to
parade
his
crime
in
the
sight
of
people
kwairyo
laughed
long
and
loudly
at
these
questions
and
then
he
said
sirs
i
did
not
fasten
the
head
to
my
sleeve
it
fastened
itself
there
much
against
my
will
and
i
have
not
committed
any
crime
for
this
is
not
the
head
of
a
man
it
is
the
head
of
a
goblin
and
if
i
caused
the
death
of
the
goblin
i
did
not
do
so
by
any
shedding
of
blood
but
simply
by
taking
the
precautions
necessary
to
assure
my
own
and
he
proceeded
to
relate
the
whole
of
the
adventure
bursting
into
another
hearty
laugh
as
he
told
of
his
encounter
with
the
five
heads
but
the
magistrates
did
not
laugh
they
judged
him
to
be
a
hardened
criminal
and
his
story
an
insult
to
their
intelligence
therefore
without
further
questioning
they
decided
to
order
his
immediate
execution
all
of
them
except
one
a
very
old
man
this
aged
officer
had
made
no
remark
during
the
trial
but
after
having
heard
the
opinion
of
his
colleagues
he
rose
up
and
said
let
us
first
examine
the
head
carefully
for
this
i
think
has
not
yet
been
done
if
the
priest
has
spoken
truth
the
head
itself
should
bear
witness
for
him
bring
the
head
here
so
the
head
still
holding
in
its
teeth
the
koromo
that
had
been
stripped
from
kwairyo
shoulders
was
put
before
the
judges
the
old
man
turned
it
round
and
round
carefully
examined
it
and
discovered
on
the
nape
of
its
neck
several
strange
red
characters
he
called
the
attention
of
his
colleagues
to
these
and
also
bade
them
observe
that
the
edges
of
the
neck
nowhere
presented
the
appearance
of
having
been
cut
by
any
weapon
on
the
contrary
the
line
of
leverance
was
smooth
as
the
line
at
which
a
falling
leaf
detaches
itself
from
the
stem
then
said
the
elder
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
priest
told
us
nothing
but
the
truth
this
is
the
head
of
a
in
the
book
it
is
written
that
certain
red
characters
can
always
be
found
upon
the
nape
of
the
neck
of
a
real
there
are
the
characters
you
can
see
for
yourselves
that
they
have
not
been
painted
moreover
it
is
well
known
that
such
goblins
have
been
dwelling
in
the
mountains
of
the
province
of
kai
from
very
ancient
time
but
you
sir
he
exclaimed
turning
to
kwairyo
what
sort
of
sturdy
priest
may
you
be
certainly
you
have
given
proof
of
a
courage
that
few
priests
possess
and
you
have
the
air
of
a
soldier
rather
than
a
priest
perhaps
you
once
belonged
to
the
you
have
guessed
rightly
sir
kwairyo
responded
before
becoming
a
priest
i
long
followed
the
profession
of
arms
and
in
those
days
i
never
feared
man
or
devil
my
name
then
was
isogai
heidazaemon
taketsura
of
kyushu
there
may
be
some
among
you
who
remember
it
at
the
mention
of
that
name
a
murmur
of
admiration
filled
the
for
there
were
many
present
who
remembered
it
and
kwairyo
immediately
found
himself
among
friends
instead
of
judges
friends
anxious
to
prove
their
admiration
by
fraternal
kindness
with
honor
they
escorted
him
to
the
residence
of
the
daimyo
who
welcomed
him
and
feasted
him
and
made
him
a
handsome
present
before
allowing
him
to
depart
when
kwairyo
left
suwa
he
was
as
happy
as
any
priest
is
permitted
to
be
in
this
transitory
world
as
for
the
head
he
took
it
with
him
jocosely
insisting
that
he
intended
it
for
a
miyage
and
now
it
only
remains
to
tell
what
became
of
the
head
a
day
or
two
after
leaving
suwa
kwairyo
met
with
a
robber
who
stopped
him
in
a
lonesome
place
and
bade
him
strip
kwairyo
at
once
removed
his
koromo
and
offered
it
to
the
robber
who
then
first
perceived
what
was
hanging
to
the
sleeve
though
brave
the
highwayman
was
startled
he
dropped
the
garment
and
sprang
back
then
he
cried
out
you
what
kind
of
a
priest
are
you
why
you
are
a
worse
man
than
i
am
it
is
true
that
i
have
killed
people
but
i
never
walked
about
with
anybody
head
fastened
to
my
sleeve
well
sir
priest
i
suppose
we
are
of
the
same
calling
and
i
must
say
that
i
admire
you
now
that
head
would
be
of
use
to
me
i
could
frighten
people
with
it
will
you
sell
it
you
can
have
my
robe
in
exchange
for
your
koromo
and
i
will
give
you
five
ryo
for
the
head
kwairyo
answered
i
shall
let
you
have
the
head
and
the
robe
if
you
insist
but
i
must
tell
you
that
this
is
not
the
head
of
a
man
it
is
a
goblin
head
so
if
you
buy
it
and
have
any
trouble
in
consequence
please
to
remember
that
you
were
not
deceived
by
me
what
a
nice
priest
you
are
exclaimed
the
robber
you
kill
men
and
jest
about
it
but
i
am
really
in
earnest
here
is
my
robe
and
here
is
the
money
and
let
me
have
the
head
what
is
the
use
of
joking
take
the
thing
said
kwairyo
i
was
not
joking
the
only
joke
if
there
be
any
joke
at
all
is
that
you
are
fool
enough
to
pay
good
money
for
a
goblin
head
and
kwairyo
loudly
laughing
went
upon
his
way
thus
the
robber
got
the
head
and
the
koromo
and
for
some
time
he
played
upon
the
highways
but
reaching
the
neighborhood
of
suwa
he
there
leaned
the
true
story
of
the
head
and
he
then
became
afraid
that
the
spirit
of
the
might
give
him
trouble
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
back
the
head
to
the
place
from
which
it
had
come
and
to
bury
it
with
its
body
he
found
his
way
to
the
lonely
cottage
in
the
mountains
of
kai
but
nobody
was
there
and
he
could
not
discover
the
body
therefore
he
buried
the
head
by
itself
in
the
grove
behind
the
cottage
and
he
had
a
tombstone
set
up
over
the
grave
and
he
caused
a
to
be
performed
on
behalf
of
the
spirit
of
the
and
that
tombstone
known
as
the
tombstone
of
the
may
be
seen
at
least
so
the
japanese
declares
even
unto
this
day
a
dead
secret
a
long
time
ago
in
the
province
of
tamba
there
lived
a
rich
merchant
named
inamuraya
gensuke
he
had
a
daughter
called
as
she
was
very
clever
and
pretty
he
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
let
her
grow
up
with
only
such
teaching
as
the
could
give
her
so
he
sent
her
in
care
of
some
trusty
attendants
to
kyoto
that
she
might
be
trained
in
the
polite
accomplishments
taught
to
the
ladies
of
the
capital
after
she
had
thus
been
educated
she
was
married
to
a
friend
of
her
father
family
a
merchant
named
nagaraya
and
she
lived
happily
with
him
for
nearly
four
years
they
had
one
child
a
boy
but
fell
ill
and
died
in
the
fourth
year
after
her
marriage
on
the
night
after
the
funeral
of
her
little
son
said
that
his
mamma
had
come
back
and
was
in
the
room
upstairs
she
had
smiled
at
him
but
would
not
talk
to
him
so
he
became
afraid
and
ran
away
then
some
of
the
family
went
upstairs
to
the
room
which
had
been
and
they
were
startled
to
see
by
the
light
of
a
small
lamp
which
had
been
kindled
before
a
shrine
in
that
room
the
figure
of
the
dead
mother
she
appeared
as
if
standing
in
front
of
a
tansu
or
chest
of
drawers
that
still
contained
her
ornaments
and
her
her
head
and
shoulders
could
be
very
distinctly
seen
but
from
the
waist
downwards
the
figure
thinned
into
invisibility
it
was
like
an
imperfect
reflection
of
her
and
transparent
as
a
shadow
on
water
then
the
folk
were
afraid
and
left
the
room
below
they
consulted
together
and
the
mother
of
husband
said
a
woman
is
fond
of
her
small
things
and
was
much
attached
to
her
belongings
perhaps
she
has
come
back
to
look
at
them
many
dead
persons
will
do
that
unless
the
things
be
given
to
the
if
we
present
robes
and
girdles
to
the
temple
her
spirit
will
probably
find
rest
it
was
agreed
that
this
should
be
done
as
soon
as
possible
so
on
the
following
morning
the
drawers
were
emptied
and
all
of
ornaments
and
dresses
were
taken
to
the
temple
but
she
came
back
the
next
night
and
looked
at
the
tansu
as
before
and
she
came
back
also
on
the
night
following
and
the
night
after
that
and
every
night
and
the
house
became
a
house
of
fear
the
mother
of
husband
then
went
to
the
and
told
the
chief
priest
all
that
had
happened
and
asked
for
ghostly
counsel
the
temple
was
a
zen
temple
and
the
was
a
learned
old
man
known
as
daigen
osho
he
said
there
must
be
something
about
which
she
is
anxious
in
or
near
that
tansu
but
we
emptied
all
the
drawers
replied
the
woman
there
is
nothing
in
the
tansu
well
said
daigen
osho
i
shall
go
to
your
house
and
keep
watch
in
that
room
and
see
what
can
be
done
you
must
give
orders
that
no
person
shall
enter
the
room
while
i
am
watching
unless
i
call
after
sundown
daigen
osho
went
to
the
house
and
found
the
room
made
ready
for
him
he
remained
there
alone
reading
the
sutras
and
nothing
appeared
until
after
the
hour
of
the
rat
then
the
figure
of
suddenly
outlined
itself
in
front
of
the
tansu
her
face
had
a
wistful
look
and
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tansu
the
priest
uttered
the
holy
formula
prescribed
in
such
cases
and
then
addressing
the
figure
by
the
kaimyo
of
said
i
have
come
here
in
order
to
help
you
perhaps
in
that
tansu
there
is
something
about
which
you
have
reason
to
feel
anxious
shall
i
try
to
find
it
for
you
the
shadow
appeared
to
give
assent
by
a
slight
motion
of
the
head
and
the
priest
rising
opened
the
top
drawer
it
was
empty
successively
he
opened
the
second
the
third
and
the
fourth
drawer
he
searched
carefully
behind
them
and
beneath
them
he
carefully
examined
the
interior
of
the
chest
he
found
nothing
but
the
figure
remained
gazing
as
wistfully
as
before
what
can
she
want
thought
the
priest
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
something
hidden
under
the
paper
with
which
the
drawers
were
lined
he
removed
the
lining
of
the
first
drawer
nothing
he
removed
the
lining
of
the
second
and
third
drawers
still
nothing
but
under
the
lining
of
the
lowermost
drawer
he
found
a
letter
is
this
the
thing
about
which
you
have
been
troubled
he
asked
the
shadow
of
the
woman
turned
toward
him
her
faint
gaze
fixed
upon
the
letter
shall
i
burn
it
for
you
he
asked
she
bowed
before
him
it
shall
be
burned
in
the
temple
this
very
morning
he
promised
and
no
one
shall
read
it
except
myself
the
figure
smiled
and
vanished
dawn
was
breaking
as
the
priest
descended
the
stairs
to
find
the
family
waiting
anxiously
below
do
not
be
anxious
he
said
to
them
she
will
not
appear
again
and
she
never
did
the
letter
was
burned
it
was
a
written
to
in
the
time
of
her
studies
at
kyoto
but
the
priest
alone
knew
what
was
in
it
and
the
secret
died
with
him
in
a
village
of
musashi
province
there
lived
two
woodcutters
mosaku
and
minokichi
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
mosaku
was
an
old
man
and
minokichi
his
apprentice
was
a
lad
of
eighteen
years
every
day
they
went
together
to
a
forest
situated
about
five
miles
from
their
village
on
the
way
to
that
forest
there
is
a
wide
river
to
cross
and
there
is
a
several
times
a
bridge
was
built
where
the
ferry
is
but
the
bridge
was
each
time
carried
away
by
a
flood
no
common
bridge
can
resist
the
current
there
when
the
river
rises
mosaku
and
minokichi
were
on
their
way
home
one
very
cold
evening
when
a
great
snowstorm
overtook
them
they
reached
the
ferry
and
they
found
that
the
boatman
had
gone
away
leaving
his
boat
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
it
was
no
day
for
swimming
and
the
woodcutters
took
shelter
in
the
ferryman
hut
thinking
themselves
lucky
to
find
any
shelter
at
all
there
was
no
brazier
in
the
hut
nor
any
place
in
which
to
make
a
fire
it
was
only
a
hut
with
a
single
door
but
no
window
mosaku
and
minokichi
fastened
the
door
and
lay
down
to
rest
with
their
straw
over
them
at
first
they
did
not
feel
very
cold
and
they
thought
that
the
storm
would
soon
be
over
the
old
man
almost
immediately
fell
asleep
but
the
boy
minokichi
lay
awake
a
long
time
listening
to
the
awful
wind
and
the
continual
slashing
of
the
snow
against
the
door
the
river
was
roaring
and
the
hut
swayed
and
creaked
like
a
junk
at
sea
it
was
a
terrible
storm
and
the
air
was
every
moment
becoming
colder
and
minokichi
shivered
under
his
but
at
last
in
spite
of
the
cold
he
too
fell
asleep
he
was
awakened
by
a
showering
of
snow
in
his
face
the
door
of
the
hut
had
been
forced
open
and
by
the
he
saw
a
woman
in
the
room
a
woman
all
in
white
she
was
bending
above
mosaku
and
blowing
her
breath
upon
him
and
her
breath
was
like
a
bright
white
smoke
almost
in
the
same
moment
she
turned
to
minokichi
and
stooped
over
him
he
tried
to
cry
out
but
found
that
he
could
not
utter
any
sound
the
white
woman
bent
down
over
him
lower
and
lower
until
her
face
almost
touched
him
and
he
saw
that
she
was
very
beautiful
though
her
eyes
made
him
afraid
for
a
little
time
she
continued
to
look
at
him
then
she
smiled
and
she
whispered
i
intended
to
treat
you
like
the
other
man
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
some
pity
for
you
because
you
are
so
young
you
are
a
pretty
boy
minokichi
and
i
will
not
hurt
you
now
but
if
you
ever
tell
anybody
even
your
own
mother
about
what
you
have
seen
this
night
i
shall
know
it
and
then
i
will
kill
you
remember
what
i
say
with
these
words
she
turned
from
him
and
passed
through
the
doorway
then
he
found
himself
able
to
move
and
he
sprang
up
and
looked
out
but
the
woman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
snow
was
driving
furiously
into
the
hut
minokichi
closed
the
door
and
secured
it
by
fixing
several
billets
of
wood
against
it
he
wondered
if
the
wind
had
blown
it
open
he
thought
that
he
might
have
been
only
dreaming
and
might
have
mistaken
the
gleam
of
the
in
the
doorway
for
the
figure
of
a
white
woman
but
he
could
not
be
sure
he
called
to
mosaku
and
was
frightened
because
the
old
man
did
not
answer
he
put
out
his
hand
in
the
dark
and
touched
mosaku
face
and
found
that
it
was
ice
mosaku
was
stark
and
dead
by
dawn
the
storm
was
over
and
when
the
ferryman
returned
to
his
station
a
little
after
sunrise
he
found
minokichi
lying
senseless
beside
the
frozen
body
of
mosaku
minokichi
was
promptly
cared
for
and
soon
came
to
himself
but
he
remained
a
long
time
ill
from
the
effects
of
the
cold
of
that
terrible
night
he
had
been
greatly
frightened
also
by
the
old
man
death
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
vision
of
the
woman
in
white
as
soon
as
he
got
well
again
he
returned
to
his
calling
going
alone
every
morning
to
the
forest
and
coming
back
at
nightfall
with
his
bundles
of
wood
which
his
mother
helped
him
to
sell
one
evening
in
the
winter
of
the
following
year
as
he
was
on
his
way
home
he
overtook
a
girl
who
happened
to
be
traveling
by
the
same
road
she
was
a
tall
slim
girl
very
and
she
answered
minokichi
greeting
in
a
voice
as
pleasant
to
the
ear
as
the
voice
of
a
then
he
walked
beside
her
and
they
began
to
talk
the
girl
said
that
her
name
was
that
she
had
lately
lost
both
of
her
parents
and
that
she
was
going
to
yedo
where
she
happened
to
have
some
poor
relations
who
might
help
her
to
find
a
situation
as
a
servant
minokichi
soon
felt
charmed
by
this
strange
girl
and
the
more
that
he
looked
at
her
the
handsomer
she
appeared
to
be
he
asked
her
whether
she
was
yet
betrothed
and
she
answered
laughingly
that
she
was
free
then
in
her
turn
she
asked
minokichi
whether
he
was
married
or
pledged
to
marry
and
he
told
her
that
although
he
had
only
a
widowed
mother
to
support
the
question
of
an
honorable
had
not
yet
been
considered
as
he
was
very
young
after
these
confidences
they
walked
on
for
a
long
while
without
speaking
but
as
the
proverb
declares
ki
ga
areba
me
mo
kuchi
hodo
ni
mono
wo
iu
when
the
wish
is
there
the
eyes
can
say
as
much
as
the
mouth
by
the
time
they
reached
the
village
they
had
become
very
much
pleased
with
each
other
and
then
minokichi
asked
to
rest
awhile
at
his
house
after
some
shy
hesitation
she
went
there
with
him
and
his
mother
made
her
welcome
and
prepared
a
warm
meal
for
her
behaved
so
nicely
that
minokichi
mother
took
a
sudden
fancy
to
her
and
persuaded
her
to
delay
her
journey
to
yedo
and
the
natural
end
of
the
matter
was
that
yuki
never
went
to
yedo
at
all
she
remained
in
the
house
as
an
honorable
proved
a
very
good
when
minokichi
mother
came
to
die
some
five
years
later
her
last
words
were
words
of
affection
and
praise
for
the
wife
of
her
son
and
bore
minokichi
ten
children
boys
and
girls
handsome
children
all
of
them
and
very
fair
of
skin
the
thought
a
wonderful
person
by
nature
different
from
themselves
most
of
the
age
early
but
even
after
having
become
the
mother
of
ten
children
looked
as
young
and
fresh
as
on
the
day
when
she
had
first
come
to
the
village
one
night
after
the
children
had
gone
to
sleep
was
sewing
by
the
light
of
a
paper
lamp
and
minokichi
watching
her
said
to
see
you
sewing
there
with
the
light
on
your
face
makes
me
think
of
a
strange
thing
that
happened
when
i
was
a
lad
of
eighteen
i
then
saw
somebody
as
beautiful
and
white
as
you
are
now
indeed
she
was
very
like
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
work
responded
tell
me
about
her
where
did
you
see
her
then
minokichi
told
her
about
the
terrible
night
in
the
hut
and
about
the
white
woman
that
had
stooped
above
him
smiling
and
whispering
and
about
the
silent
death
of
old
mosaku
and
he
said
asleep
or
awake
that
was
the
only
time
that
i
saw
a
being
as
beautiful
as
you
of
course
she
was
not
a
human
being
and
i
was
afraid
of
her
very
much
afraid
but
she
was
so
white
indeed
i
have
never
been
sure
whether
it
was
a
dream
that
i
saw
or
the
woman
of
the
flung
down
her
sewing
and
arose
and
bowed
above
minokichi
where
he
sat
and
shrieked
into
his
face
it
was
i
i
i
yuki
it
was
and
i
told
you
then
that
i
would
kill
you
if
you
ever
said
one
word
about
it
but
for
those
children
asleep
there
i
would
kill
you
this
moment
and
now
you
had
better
take
very
very
good
care
of
them
for
if
ever
they
have
reason
to
complain
of
you
i
will
treat
you
as
you
deserve
even
as
she
screamed
her
voice
became
thin
like
a
crying
of
wind
then
she
melted
into
a
bright
white
mist
that
spired
to
the
and
shuddered
away
through
the
never
again
was
she
seen
the
story
of
aoyagi
in
the
era
of
bummei
there
was
a
young
samurai
called
tomotada
in
the
service
of
hatakeyama
yoshimune
the
lord
of
noto
tomotada
was
a
native
of
echizen
but
at
an
early
age
he
had
been
taken
as
page
into
the
palace
of
the
daimyo
of
noto
and
had
been
educated
under
the
supervision
of
that
prince
for
the
profession
of
arms
as
he
grew
up
he
proved
himself
both
a
good
scholar
and
a
good
soldier
and
continued
to
enjoy
the
favor
of
his
prince
being
gifted
with
an
amiable
character
a
winning
address
and
a
very
handsome
person
he
was
admired
and
much
liked
by
his
when
tomotada
was
about
twenty
years
old
he
was
sent
upon
a
private
mission
to
hosokawa
masamoto
the
great
daimyo
of
kyoto
a
kinsman
of
hatakeyama
yoshimune
having
been
ordered
to
journey
through
echizen
the
youth
requested
and
obtained
permission
to
pay
a
visit
on
the
way
to
his
widowed
mother
it
was
the
coldest
period
of
the
year
when
he
started
and
though
mounted
upon
a
powerful
horse
he
found
himself
obliged
to
proceed
slowly
the
road
which
he
followed
passed
through
a
where
the
settlements
were
few
and
far
between
and
on
the
second
day
of
his
journey
after
a
weary
ride
of
hours
he
was
dismayed
to
find
that
he
could
not
reach
his
intended
until
late
in
the
night
he
had
reason
to
be
anxious
for
a
heavy
snowstorm
came
on
with
an
intensely
cold
wind
and
the
horse
showed
signs
of
exhaustion
but
in
that
trying
moment
tomotada
unexpectedly
perceived
the
thatched
room
of
a
cottage
on
the
summit
of
a
near
hill
where
were
growing
with
difficulty
he
urged
his
tired
animal
to
the
dwelling
and
he
loudly
knocked
upon
the
which
had
been
closed
against
the
wind
an
old
woman
opened
them
and
cried
out
compassionately
at
the
sight
of
the
handsome
stranger
ah
how
pitiful
a
young
gentleman
traveling
alone
in
such
weather
deign
young
master
to
enter
tomotada
dismounted
and
after
leading
his
horse
to
a
shed
in
the
rear
entered
the
cottage
where
he
saw
an
old
man
and
a
girl
warming
themselves
by
a
fire
of
bamboo
splints
they
respectfully
invited
him
to
approach
the
fire
and
the
old
folks
then
proceeded
to
warm
some
and
to
prepare
food
for
the
traveler
whom
they
ventured
to
question
in
regard
to
his
journey
meanwhile
the
young
girl
disappeared
behind
a
screen
tomotada
had
observed
with
astonishment
that
she
was
extremely
beautiful
though
her
attire
was
of
the
most
wretched
kind
and
her
long
loose
hair
in
disorder
he
wondered
that
so
handsome
a
girl
should
be
living
in
such
a
miserable
and
lonesome
place
the
old
man
said
to
him
honored
sir
the
next
village
is
far
and
the
snow
is
falling
thickly
the
wind
is
piercing
and
the
road
is
very
bad
therefore
to
proceed
further
this
night
would
probably
be
dangerous
although
this
hovel
is
unworthy
of
your
presence
and
although
we
have
not
any
comfort
to
offer
perhaps
it
were
safer
to
remain
under
this
miserable
roof
we
would
take
good
care
of
your
horse
tomotada
accepted
this
humble
proposal
secretly
glad
of
the
chance
thus
afforded
him
to
see
more
of
the
young
girl
presently
a
coarse
but
ample
meal
was
set
before
him
and
the
girl
came
from
behind
the
screen
to
serve
the
wine
she
was
now
reclad
in
a
rough
but
cleanly
robe
of
homespun
and
her
long
loose
hair
had
been
neatly
combed
and
smoothed
as
she
bent
forward
to
fill
his
cup
tomotada
was
amazed
to
perceive
that
she
was
incomparably
more
beautiful
than
any
woman
whom
he
had
ever
before
seen
and
there
was
a
grace
about
her
every
motion
that
astonished
him
but
the
elders
began
to
apologize
for
her
saying
sir
our
daughter
aoyagi
has
been
brought
up
here
in
the
mountains
almost
alone
and
she
knows
nothing
of
gentle
service
we
pray
that
you
will
pardon
her
stupidity
and
her
ignorance
tomotada
protested
that
he
deemed
himself
lucky
to
be
waited
upon
by
so
comely
a
maiden
he
could
not
turn
his
eyes
away
from
her
though
he
saw
that
his
admiring
gaze
made
her
blush
and
he
left
the
wine
and
food
untasted
before
him
the
mother
said
kind
sir
we
very
much
hope
that
you
will
try
to
eat
and
to
drink
a
little
though
our
is
of
the
worst
as
you
must
have
been
chilled
by
that
piercing
wind
then
to
please
the
old
folks
tomotada
ate
and
drank
as
he
could
but
the
charm
of
the
blushing
girl
still
grew
upon
him
he
talked
with
her
and
found
that
her
speech
was
sweet
as
her
face
brought
up
in
the
mountains
as
she
might
have
been
but
in
that
case
her
parents
must
at
some
time
been
persons
of
high
degree
for
she
spoke
and
moved
like
a
damsel
of
rank
suddenly
he
addressed
her
with
a
poem
which
was
also
a
question
inspired
by
the
delight
in
his
heart
tadzunetsuru
hana
ka
tote
koso
hi
wo
kurase
akenu
ni
otoru
akane
sasuran
being
on
my
way
to
pay
a
visit
i
found
that
which
i
took
to
be
a
flower
therefore
here
i
spend
the
day
why
in
the
time
before
dawn
the
tint
should
glow
that
indeed
i
know
not
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
answered
him
in
these
verses
izuru
hi
no
honomeku
iro
wo
waga
sode
ni
tsutsumaba
asu
mo
kimiya
tomaran
if
with
my
sleeve
i
hid
the
faint
fair
color
of
the
dawning
sun
then
perhaps
in
the
morning
my
lord
will
remain
then
tomotada
knew
that
she
accepted
his
admiration
and
he
was
scarcely
less
surprised
by
the
art
with
which
she
had
uttered
her
feelings
in
verse
than
delighted
by
the
assurance
which
the
verses
conveyed
he
was
now
certain
that
in
all
this
world
he
could
not
hope
to
meet
much
less
to
win
a
girl
more
beautiful
and
witty
than
this
rustic
maid
before
him
and
a
voice
in
his
heart
seemed
to
cry
out
urgently
take
the
luck
that
the
gods
have
put
in
your
way
in
short
he
was
bewitched
bewitched
to
such
a
degree
that
without
further
preliminary
he
asked
the
old
people
to
give
him
their
daughter
in
marriage
telling
them
at
the
same
time
his
name
and
lineage
and
his
rank
in
the
train
of
the
lord
of
noto
they
bowed
down
before
him
with
many
exclamations
of
grateful
astonishment
but
after
some
moments
of
apparent
hesitation
the
father
replied
honored
master
you
are
a
person
of
high
position
and
likely
to
rise
to
still
higher
things
too
great
is
the
favor
that
you
deign
to
offer
us
indeed
the
depth
of
our
gratitude
therefor
is
not
to
be
spoken
or
measured
but
this
girl
of
ours
being
a
stupid
of
vulgar
birth
with
no
training
or
teaching
of
any
sort
it
would
be
improper
to
let
her
become
the
wife
of
a
noble
samurai
even
to
speak
of
such
a
matter
is
not
right
but
since
you
find
the
girl
to
your
liking
and
have
condescended
to
pardon
her
and
to
overlook
her
great
rudeness
we
do
gladly
present
her
to
you
for
an
humble
handmaid
deign
therefore
to
act
hereafter
in
her
regard
according
to
your
august
pleasure
ere
morning
the
storm
had
passed
and
day
broke
through
a
cloudless
east
even
if
the
sleeve
of
aoyagi
hid
from
her
lover
eyes
the
of
that
dawn
he
could
no
longer
tarry
but
neither
could
he
resign
himself
to
part
with
the
girl
and
when
everything
had
been
prepared
for
his
journey
he
thus
addressed
her
parents
though
it
may
seem
thankless
to
ask
for
more
than
i
have
already
received
i
must
again
beg
you
to
give
me
your
daughter
for
wife
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
separate
from
her
now
and
as
she
is
willing
to
accompany
me
if
you
permit
i
can
take
her
with
me
as
she
is
if
you
will
give
her
to
me
i
shall
ever
cherish
you
as
parents
and
in
the
meantime
please
to
accept
this
poor
acknowledgment
of
your
kindest
hospitality
so
saying
he
placed
before
his
humble
host
a
purse
of
gold
ryo
but
the
old
man
after
many
prostrations
gently
pushed
back
the
gift
and
said
kind
master
the
gold
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
and
you
will
probably
have
need
of
it
during
your
long
cold
journey
here
we
buy
nothing
and
we
could
not
spend
so
much
money
upon
ourselves
even
if
we
wished
as
for
the
girl
we
have
already
bestowed
her
as
a
free
gift
she
belongs
to
you
therefore
it
is
not
necessary
to
ask
our
leave
to
take
her
away
already
she
has
told
us
that
she
hopes
to
accompany
you
and
to
remain
your
servant
for
as
long
as
you
may
be
willing
to
endure
her
presence
we
are
only
too
happy
to
know
that
you
deign
to
accept
her
and
we
pray
that
you
will
not
trouble
yourself
on
our
account
in
this
place
we
could
not
provide
her
with
proper
clothing
much
less
with
a
dowry
moreover
being
old
we
should
in
any
event
have
to
separate
from
her
before
long
therefore
it
is
very
fortunate
that
you
should
be
willing
to
take
her
with
you
now
it
was
in
vain
that
tomotada
tried
to
persuade
the
old
people
to
accept
a
present
he
found
that
they
cared
nothing
for
money
but
he
saw
that
they
were
really
anxious
to
trust
their
daughter
fate
to
his
hands
and
he
therefore
decided
to
take
her
with
him
so
he
placed
her
upon
his
horse
and
bade
the
old
folks
farewell
for
the
time
being
with
many
sincere
expressions
of
gratitude
honored
sir
the
father
made
answer
it
is
we
and
not
you
who
have
reason
for
gratitude
we
are
sure
that
you
will
be
kind
to
our
girl
and
we
have
no
fears
for
her
here
in
the
japanese
original
there
is
a
queer
break
in
the
natural
course
of
the
narration
which
therefrom
remains
curiously
inconsistent
nothing
further
is
said
about
the
mother
of
tomotada
or
about
the
parents
of
aoyagi
or
about
the
daimyo
of
noto
evidently
the
writer
wearied
of
his
work
at
this
point
and
hurried
the
story
very
carelessly
to
its
startling
end
i
am
not
able
to
supply
his
omissions
or
to
repair
his
faults
of
construction
but
i
must
venture
to
put
in
a
few
explanatory
details
without
which
the
rest
of
the
tale
would
not
hold
together
it
appears
that
tomotada
rashly
took
aoyagi
with
him
to
kyoto
and
so
got
into
trouble
but
we
are
not
informed
as
to
where
the
couple
lived
afterwards
now
a
samurai
was
not
allowed
to
marry
without
the
consent
of
his
lord
and
tomotada
could
not
expect
to
obtain
this
sanction
before
his
mission
had
been
accomplished
he
had
reason
under
such
circumstances
to
fear
that
the
beauty
of
aoyagi
might
attract
dangerous
attention
and
that
means
might
be
devised
of
taking
her
away
from
him
in
kyoto
he
therefore
tried
to
keep
her
hidden
from
curious
eyes
but
a
retainer
of
lord
hosokawa
one
day
caught
sight
of
aoyagi
discovered
her
relation
to
tomotada
and
reported
the
matter
to
the
daimyo
thereupon
the
daimyo
a
young
prince
and
fond
of
pretty
faces
gave
orders
that
the
girl
should
be
brought
to
the
place
and
she
was
taken
thither
at
once
without
ceremony
tomotada
sorrowed
unspeakably
but
he
knew
himself
powerless
he
was
only
an
humble
messenger
in
the
service
of
a
daimyo
and
for
the
time
being
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
a
much
more
powerful
daimyo
whose
wishes
were
not
to
be
questioned
moreover
tomotada
knew
that
he
had
acted
foolishly
that
he
had
brought
about
his
own
misfortune
by
entering
into
a
clandestine
relation
which
the
code
of
the
military
class
condemned
there
was
now
but
one
hope
for
him
a
desperate
hope
that
aoyagi
might
be
able
and
willing
to
escape
and
to
flee
with
him
after
long
reflection
he
resolved
to
try
to
send
her
a
letter
the
attempt
would
be
dangerous
of
course
any
writing
sent
to
her
might
find
its
way
to
the
hands
of
the
daimyo
and
to
send
a
to
any
inmate
of
the
place
was
an
unpardonable
offense
but
he
resolved
to
dare
the
risk
and
in
the
form
of
a
chinese
poem
he
composed
a
letter
which
he
endeavored
to
have
conveyed
to
her
the
poem
was
written
with
only
characters
but
with
those
characters
he
was
about
to
express
all
the
depth
of
his
passion
and
to
suggest
all
the
pain
of
his
loss

the
youthful

now
follows
after
the
maid
the
tears
of
the
fair
one
falling
have
moistened
all
her
robes
but
the
august
lord
having
once
become
enamored
of
her
the
depth
of
his
longing
is
like
the
depth
of
the
sea
therefore
it
is
only
i
that
am
left
forlorn
only
i
that
am
left
to
wander
along
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
this
poem
had
been
sent
tomotada
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
lord
hosokawa
the
youth
at
once
suspected
that
his
confidence
had
been
betrayed
and
he
could
not
hope
if
his
letter
had
been
seen
by
the
daimyo
to
escape
the
severest
penalty
now
he
will
order
my
death
thought
tomotada
but
i
do
not
care
to
live
unless
aoyagi
be
restored
to
me
besides
if
the
be
passed
i
can
at
least
try
to
kill
hosokawa
he
slipped
his
swords
into
his
girdle
and
hastened
to
the
palace
on
entering
the
he
saw
the
lord
hosokawa
seated
upon
the
dais
surrounded
by
samurai
of
high
rank
in
caps
and
robes
of
ceremony
all
were
silent
as
statues
and
while
tomotada
advanced
to
make
obeisance
the
hush
seemed
to
his
sinister
and
heavy
like
the
stillness
before
a
storm
but
hosokawa
suddenly
descended
from
the
dais
and
while
taking
the
youth
by
the
arm
began
to
repeat
the
words
of
the
poem
koshi
gojin
wo
and
tomotada
looking
up
saw
kindly
tears
in
the
prince
eyes
then
said
hosokawa
because
you
love
each
other
so
much
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
authorize
your
marriage
in
lieu
of
my
kinsman
the
lord
of
noto
and
your
wedding
shall
now
be
celebrated
before
me
the
guests
are
assembled
the
gifts
are
ready
at
a
signal
from
the
lord
the
concealing
a
further
apartment
were
pushed
open
and
tomotada
saw
there
many
dignitaries
of
the
court
assembled
for
the
ceremony
and
aoyagi
awaiting
him
in
brides
apparel
thus
was
she
given
back
to
him
and
the
wedding
was
joyous
and
splendid
and
precious
gifts
were
made
to
the
young
couple
by
the
prince
and
by
the
members
of
his
household
for
five
happy
years
after
that
wedding
tomotada
and
aoyagi
dwelt
together
but
one
morning
aoyagi
while
talking
with
her
husband
about
some
household
matter
suddenly
uttered
a
great
cry
of
pain
and
then
became
very
white
and
still
after
a
few
moments
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
pardon
me
for
thus
rudely
crying
out
but
the
pain
was
so
sudden
my
dear
husband
our
union
must
have
been
brought
about
through
some
in
a
former
state
of
existence
and
that
happy
relation
i
think
will
bring
us
again
together
in
more
than
one
life
to
come
but
for
this
present
existence
of
ours
the
relation
is
now
ended
we
are
about
to
be
separated
repeat
for
me
i
beseech
you
the
because
i
am
dying
oh
what
strange
wild
fancies
cried
the
startled
husband
you
are
only
a
little
unwell
my
dear
one
lie
down
for
a
while
and
rest
and
the
sickness
will
no
no
she
responded
i
am
dying
i
do
not
imagine
it
i
know
and
it
were
needless
now
my
dear
husband
to
hide
the
truth
from
you
any
longer
i
am
not
a
human
being
the
soul
of
a
tree
is
my
soul
the
heart
of
a
tree
is
my
heart
the
sap
of
the
willow
is
my
life
and
some
one
at
this
cruel
moment
is
cutting
down
my
tree
that
is
why
i
must
die
even
to
weep
were
now
beyond
my
strength
quickly
quickly
repeat
the
nembutsu
for
me
quickly
ah
with
another
cry
of
pain
she
turned
aside
her
beautiful
head
and
tried
to
hide
her
face
behind
her
sleeve
but
almost
in
the
same
moment
her
whole
form
appeared
to
collapse
in
the
strangest
way
and
to
sink
down
down
down
level
with
the
floor
tomotada
had
sprung
to
support
her
but
there
was
nothing
to
support
there
lay
on
the
matting
only
the
empty
robes
of
the
fair
creature
and
the
ornaments
that
she
had
worn
in
her
hair
the
body
had
ceased
to
exist
tomotada
shaved
his
head
took
the
buddhist
vows
and
became
an
itinerant
priest
he
traveled
through
all
the
provinces
of
the
empire
and
at
holy
places
which
he
visited
he
offered
up
prayers
for
the
soul
of
aoyagi
reaching
echizen
in
the
course
of
his
pilgrimage
he
sought
the
home
of
the
parents
of
his
beloved
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
lonely
place
among
the
hills
where
their
dwelling
had
been
he
found
that
the
cottage
had
disappeared
there
was
nothing
to
mark
even
the
spot
where
it
had
stood
except
the
stumps
of
three
willows
two
old
trees
and
one
young
tree
that
had
been
cut
down
long
before
his
arrival
beside
the
stumps
of
those
he
erected
a
memorial
tomb
inscribed
with
divers
holy
texts
and
he
there
performed
many
buddhist
services
on
behalf
of
the
spirits
of
aoyagi
and
of
her
parents
in
wakegori
a
district
of
the
province
of
iyo
there
is
a
very
ancient
and
famous
called
or
the
of
the
sixteenth
day
because
it
blooms
every
year
upon
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
by
the
old
lunar
calendar
and
only
upon
that
day
thus
the
time
of
its
flowering
is
the
period
of
great
cold
though
the
natural
habit
of
a
is
to
wait
for
the
spring
season
before
venturing
to
blossom
but
the
blossoms
with
a
life
that
is
not
or
at
least
that
was
not
originally
its
own
there
is
the
ghost
of
a
man
in
that
tree
he
was
a
samurai
of
iyo
and
the
tree
grew
in
his
garden
and
it
used
to
flower
at
the
usual
time
that
is
to
say
about
the
end
of
march
or
the
beginning
of
april
he
had
played
under
that
tree
when
he
was
a
child
and
his
parents
and
grandparents
and
ancestors
had
hung
to
its
blossoming
branches
season
after
season
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
bright
strips
of
colored
paper
inscribed
with
poems
of
praise
he
himself
became
very
old
outliving
all
his
children
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
left
for
him
to
live
except
that
tree
and
lo
in
the
summer
of
a
certain
year
the
tree
withered
and
died
exceedingly
the
old
man
sorrowed
for
his
tree
then
kind
neighbors
found
for
him
a
young
and
beautiful
and
planted
it
in
his
garden
hoping
thus
to
comfort
him
and
he
thanked
them
and
pretended
to
be
glad
but
really
his
heart
was
full
of
pain
for
he
had
loved
the
old
tree
so
well
that
nothing
could
have
consoled
him
for
the
loss
of
it
at
last
there
came
to
him
a
happy
thought
he
remembered
a
way
by
which
the
perishing
tree
might
be
saved
it
was
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
along
he
went
into
his
garden
and
bowed
down
before
the
withered
tree
and
spoke
to
it
saying
now
deign
i
beseech
you
once
more
to
bloom
because
i
am
going
to
die
in
your
stead
for
it
is
believed
that
one
can
really
give
away
one
life
to
another
person
or
to
a
creature
or
even
to
a
tree
by
the
favor
of
the
gods
and
thus
to
transfer
one
life
is
expressed
by
the
term
migawari
ni
tatsu
to
act
as
a
substitute
then
under
that
tree
he
spread
a
white
cloth
and
divers
coverings
and
sat
down
upon
the
coverings
and
performed
after
the
fashion
of
a
samurai
and
the
ghost
of
him
went
into
the
tree
and
made
it
blossom
in
that
same
hour
and
every
year
it
still
blooms
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
first
month
in
the
season
of
snow
the
dream
of
akinosuke
in
the
district
called
toichi
of
yamato
province
there
used
to
live
a
goshi
named
miyata
akinosuke
here
i
must
tell
you
that
in
japanese
feudal
times
there
was
a
privileged
class
of
corresponding
to
the
class
of
yeomen
in
england
and
these
were
called
goshi
in
akinosuke
garden
there
was
a
great
and
ancient
under
which
he
was
wont
to
rest
on
sultry
days
one
very
warm
afternoon
he
was
sitting
under
this
tree
with
two
of
his
friends
chatting
and
drinking
wine
when
he
felt
all
of
a
sudden
very
drowsy
so
drowsy
that
he
begged
his
friends
to
excuse
him
for
taking
a
nap
in
their
presence
then
he
lay
down
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
dreamed
this
dream
he
thought
that
as
he
was
lying
there
in
his
garden
he
saw
a
procession
like
the
train
of
some
great
daimyo
descending
a
hill
near
by
and
that
he
got
up
to
look
at
it
a
very
grand
procession
it
proved
to
be
more
imposing
than
anything
of
the
kind
which
he
had
ever
seen
before
and
it
was
advancing
toward
his
dwelling
he
observed
in
the
van
of
it
a
number
of
young
men
richly
appareled
who
were
drawing
a
great
lacquered
or
hung
with
bright
blue
silk
when
the
procession
arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
house
it
halted
and
a
richly
dressed
man
evidently
a
person
of
rank
advanced
from
it
approached
akinosuke
bowed
to
him
profoundly
and
then
said
honored
sir
you
see
before
you
a
kerai
vassal
of
the
kokuo
of
tokoyo
my
master
the
king
commands
me
to
greet
you
in
his
august
name
and
to
place
myself
wholly
at
your
disposal
he
also
bids
me
inform
you
that
he
augustly
desires
your
presence
at
the
palace
be
therefore
pleased
immediately
to
enter
this
honorable
carriage
which
he
has
sent
for
your
conveyance
upon
hearing
these
words
akinosuke
wanted
to
make
some
fitting
reply
but
he
was
too
much
astonished
and
embarrassed
for
speech
and
in
the
same
moment
his
will
seemed
to
melt
away
from
him
so
that
he
could
only
do
as
the
kerai
bade
him
he
entered
the
carriage
the
kerai
took
a
place
beside
him
and
made
a
signal
the
drawers
seizing
the
silken
ropes
turned
the
great
vehicle
southward
and
the
journey
began
in
a
very
short
time
to
akinosuke
amazement
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
a
huge
gateway
romon
of
a
chinese
style
which
he
had
never
before
seen
here
the
kerai
dismounted
saying
i
go
to
announce
the
honorable
arrival
and
he
disappeared
after
some
little
waiting
akinosuke
saw
two
men
wearing
robes
of
purple
silk
and
high
caps
of
the
form
indicating
lofty
rank
come
from
the
gateway
these
after
having
respectfully
saluted
him
helped
him
to
descend
from
the
carriage
and
led
him
through
the
great
gate
and
across
a
vast
garden
to
the
entrance
of
a
palace
whose
front
appeared
to
extend
west
and
east
to
a
distance
of
miles
akinosuke
was
then
shown
into
a
of
wonderful
size
and
splendor
his
guides
conducted
him
to
the
place
of
honor
and
respectfully
seated
themselves
apart
while
in
costume
of
ceremony
brought
refreshments
when
akinosuke
had
partaken
of
the
refreshments
the
two
attendants
bowed
low
before
him
and
addressed
him
in
the
following
words
each
speaking
alternately
according
to
the
etiquette
of
courts
it
is
now
our
honorable
duty
to
inform
you
as
to
the
reason
of
your
having
been
summoned
hither
our
master
the
king
augustly
desires
that
you
become
his
and
it
is
his
wish
and
command
that
you
shall
wed
this
very
day
the
august
princess
his
we
shall
soon
conduct
you
to
the
where
his
augustness
even
now
is
waiting
to
receive
you
but
it
will
be
necessary
that
we
first
invest
you
with
the
appropriate
garments
of
ceremony
having
thus
spoken
the
attendants
rose
together
and
proceeded
to
an
alcove
containing
a
great
chest
of
gold
lacquer
they
opened
the
chest
and
took
from
it
various
roes
and
girdles
of
rich
material
and
a
kamuri
or
regal
headdress
with
these
they
attired
akinosuke
as
befitted
a
princely
bridegroom
and
he
was
then
conducted
to
the
where
he
saw
the
kokuo
of
tokoyo
seated
upon
the
daiza
wearing
a
high
black
cap
of
state
and
robed
in
robes
of
yellow
silk
before
the
daiza
to
left
and
right
a
multitude
of
dignitaries
sat
in
rank
motionless
and
splendid
as
images
in
a
temple
and
akinosuke
advancing
into
their
midst
saluted
the
king
with
the
triple
prostration
of
usage
the
king
greeted
him
with
gracious
words
and
then
said
you
have
already
been
informed
as
to
the
reason
of
your
having
been
summoned
to
our
presence
we
have
decided
that
you
shall
become
the
adopted
husband
of
our
only
daughter
and
the
wedding
ceremony
shall
now
be
performed
as
the
king
finished
speaking
a
sound
of
joyful
music
was
heard
and
a
long
train
of
beautiful
court
ladies
advanced
from
behind
a
curtain
to
conduct
akinosuke
to
the
room
in
which
he
bride
awaited
him
the
room
was
immense
but
it
could
scarcely
contain
the
multitude
of
guests
assembled
to
witness
the
wedding
ceremony
all
bowed
down
before
akinosuke
as
he
took
his
place
facing
the
king
daughter
on
the
prepared
for
him
as
a
maiden
of
heaven
the
bride
appeared
to
be
and
her
robes
were
beautiful
as
a
summer
sky
and
the
marriage
was
performed
amid
great
rejoicing
afterwards
the
pair
were
conducted
to
a
suite
of
apartments
that
had
been
prepared
for
them
in
another
portion
of
the
palace
and
there
they
received
the
congratulations
of
many
noble
persons
and
wedding
gifts
beyond
counting
some
days
later
akinosuke
was
again
summoned
to
the
on
this
occasion
he
was
received
even
more
graciously
than
before
and
the
king
said
to
him
in
the
southwestern
part
of
our
dominion
there
is
an
island
called
raishu
we
have
now
appointed
you
governor
of
that
island
you
will
find
the
people
loyal
and
docile
but
their
laws
have
not
yet
been
brought
into
proper
accord
with
the
laws
of
tokoyo
and
their
customs
have
not
been
properly
regulated
we
entrust
you
with
the
duty
of
improving
their
social
condition
as
far
as
may
be
possible
and
we
desire
that
you
shall
rule
them
with
kindness
and
wisdom
all
preparations
necessary
for
your
journey
to
raishu
have
already
been
made
so
akinosuke
and
his
bride
departed
from
the
palace
of
tokoyo
accompanied
to
the
shore
by
a
great
escort
of
nobles
and
officials
and
they
embarked
upon
a
ship
of
state
provided
by
the
king
and
with
favoring
winds
they
safety
sailed
to
raishu
and
found
the
good
people
of
that
island
assembled
upon
the
beach
to
welcome
them
akinosuke
entered
at
once
upon
his
new
duties
and
they
did
not
prove
to
be
hard
during
the
first
three
years
of
his
governorship
he
was
occupied
chiefly
with
the
framing
and
the
enactment
of
laws
but
he
had
wise
counselors
to
help
him
and
he
never
found
the
work
unpleasant
when
it
was
all
finished
he
had
no
active
duties
to
perform
beyond
attending
the
rites
and
ceremonies
ordained
by
ancient
custom
the
country
was
so
healthy
and
so
fertile
that
sickness
and
want
were
unknown
and
the
people
were
so
good
that
no
laws
were
ever
broken
and
akinosuke
dwelt
and
ruled
in
raishu
for
twenty
years
more
making
in
all
years
of
sojourn
during
which
no
shadow
of
sorrow
traversed
his
life
but
in
the
year
of
his
governorship
a
great
misfortune
came
upon
him
for
his
wife
who
had
borne
him
seven
children
five
boys
and
two
girls
fell
sick
and
died
she
was
buried
with
high
pomp
on
the
summit
of
a
beautiful
hill
in
the
district
of
hanryoko
and
a
monument
exceedingly
splendid
was
placed
upon
her
grave
but
akinosuke
felt
such
grief
at
her
death
that
he
no
longer
cared
to
live
now
when
the
legal
period
of
mourning
was
over
there
came
to
raishu
from
the
tokoyo
palace
a
shisha
or
royal
messenger
the
shisha
delivered
to
akinosuke
a
message
of
condolence
and
then
said
to
him
these
are
the
words
which
our
august
master
the
king
of
tokoyo
commands
that
i
repeat
to
you
will
now
send
you
back
to
your
own
people
and
country
as
for
the
seven
children
they
are
the
grandsons
and
granddaughters
of
the
king
and
shall
be
fitly
cared
for
do
not
therefore
allow
your
mind
to
be
troubled
concerning
them
on
receiving
this
mandate
akinosuke
submissively
prepared
for
his
departure
when
all
his
affairs
had
been
settled
and
the
ceremony
of
bidding
farewell
to
his
counselors
and
trusted
officials
had
been
concluded
he
was
escorted
with
much
honor
to
the
port
there
he
embarked
upon
the
ship
sent
for
him
and
the
ship
sailed
out
into
the
blue
sea
under
the
blue
sky
and
the
shape
of
the
island
of
raishu
itself
turned
blue
and
then
turned
grey
and
then
vanished
forever
and
akinosuke
suddenly
awoke
under
the
in
his
own
garden
for
a
moment
he
was
stupefied
and
dazed
but
he
perceived
his
two
friends
still
seated
near
him
drinking
and
chatting
merrily
he
stared
at
them
in
a
bewildered
way
and
cried
aloud
how
strange
akinosuke
must
have
been
dreaming
one
of
them
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
what
did
you
see
akinosuke
that
was
strange
then
akinosuke
told
his
dream
that
dream
of
sojourn
in
the
realm
of
tokoyo
in
the
island
of
raishu
and
they
were
astonished
because
he
had
really
slept
for
no
more
than
a
few
minutes
one
goshi
said
indeed
you
saw
strange
things
we
also
saw
something
strange
while
you
were
napping
a
little
yellow
butterfly
was
fluttering
over
your
face
for
a
moment
or
two
and
we
watched
it
then
it
alighted
on
the
ground
beside
you
close
to
the
tree
and
almost
as
soon
as
it
alighted
there
a
big
big
ant
came
out
of
a
hole
and
seized
it
and
pulled
it
down
into
the
hole
just
before
you
woke
up
we
saw
that
very
butterfly
come
out
of
the
hole
again
and
flutter
over
your
face
as
before
and
then
it
suddenly
disappeared
we
do
not
know
where
it
went
perhaps
it
was
akinosuke
soul
the
other
goshi
said
certainly
i
thought
i
saw
it
fly
into
his
mouth
but
even
if
that
butterfly
was
akinosuke
soul
the
fact
would
not
explain
his
dream
the
ants
might
explain
it
returned
the
first
speaker
ants
are
queer
beings
possibly
goblins
anyhow
there
is
a
big
ant
nest
under
that
let
us
look
cried
akinosuke
greatly
moved
by
this
suggestion
and
he
went
for
a
spade
the
ground
about
and
beneath
the
proved
to
have
been
excavated
in
a
most
surprising
way
by
a
prodigious
colony
of
ants
the
ants
had
furthermore
built
inside
their
excavations
and
their
tiny
constructions
of
straw
clay
and
stems
bore
an
odd
resemblance
to
miniature
towns
in
the
middle
of
a
structure
considerably
larger
than
the
rest
there
was
a
marvelous
swarming
of
small
ants
around
the
body
of
one
very
big
ant
which
had
yellowish
wings
and
a
long
black
head
why
there
is
the
king
of
my
dream
cried
akinosuke
and
there
is
the
palace
of
tokoyo
how
extraordinary
raishu
ought
to
lie
somewhere
southwest
of
it
to
the
left
of
that
big
root
yes
here
it
is
how
very
strange
now
i
am
sure
that
i
can
find
the
mountain
of
hanryoko
and
the
grave
of
the
in
the
wreck
of
the
nest
he
searched
and
searched
and
at
last
discovered
a
tiny
mound
on
the
top
of
which
was
fixed
a
pebble
in
shape
resembling
a
buddhist
monument
underneath
it
he
found
embedded
in
clay
the
dead
body
of
a
female
ant
his
name
was
riki
signifying
strength
but
the
people
called
him
or
because
he
had
been
born
into
perpetual
childhood
for
the
same
reason
they
were
kind
to
him
even
when
he
set
a
house
on
fire
by
putting
a
lighted
match
to
a
and
clapped
his
hands
for
joy
to
see
the
blaze
at
sixteen
years
he
was
a
tall
strong
lad
but
in
mind
he
remained
always
at
the
happy
age
of
two
and
therefore
continued
to
play
with
very
small
children
the
bigger
children
of
the
neighborhood
from
four
to
seven
years
old
did
not
care
to
play
with
him
because
he
could
not
learn
their
songs
and
games
his
favorite
toy
was
a
broomstick
which
he
used
as
a
and
for
hours
at
a
time
he
would
ride
on
that
broomstick
up
and
down
the
slope
in
front
of
my
house
with
amazing
peals
of
laughter
but
at
last
he
became
troublesome
by
reason
of
his
noise
and
i
had
to
tell
him
that
he
must
find
another
playground
he
bowed
submissively
and
then
went
off
sorrowfully
trailing
his
broomstick
behind
him
gentle
at
all
times
and
perfectly
harmless
if
allowed
no
chance
to
play
with
fire
he
seldom
gave
anybody
cause
for
complaint
his
relation
to
the
life
of
our
street
was
scarcely
more
than
that
of
a
dog
or
a
chicken
and
when
he
finally
disappeared
i
did
not
miss
him
months
and
months
passed
by
before
anything
happened
to
remind
me
of
riki
what
has
become
of
riki
i
then
asked
the
old
woodcutter
who
supplies
our
neighborhood
with
fuel
i
remembered
that
riki
had
often
helped
him
to
carry
his
bundles
answered
the
old
man
ah
riki
is
dead
poor
fellow
yes
he
died
nearly
a
year
ago
very
suddenly
the
doctors
said
that
he
had
some
disease
of
the
brain
and
there
is
a
strange
story
now
about
that
poor
riki
when
riki
died
his
mother
wrote
his
name
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
putting
in
the
chinese
character
and
in
kana
and
she
repeated
many
prayers
for
him
prayers
that
he
might
be
reborn
into
some
more
happy
condition
now
about
three
months
ago
in
the
honorable
residence
of
in
kojimachi
a
boy
was
born
with
characters
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
and
the
characters
were
quite
plain
to
read
so
the
people
of
that
house
knew
that
the
birth
must
have
happened
in
answer
to
somebody
prayer
and
they
caused
inquiry
to
be
made
everywhere
at
last
a
brought
word
to
them
that
there
used
to
be
a
simple
lad
called
living
in
the
ushigome
quarter
and
that
he
had
died
during
the
last
autumn
and
they
sent
two
to
look
for
the
mother
of
riki
those
servants
found
the
mother
of
riki
and
told
her
what
had
happened
and
she
was
glad
exceedingly
for
that
nanigashi
house
is
a
very
rich
and
famous
house
but
the
servants
said
that
the
family
of
were
very
angry
about
the
word
on
the
hand
where
is
your
riki
buried
the
servants
asked
is
buried
in
the
cemetery
of
zendoji
she
told
them
to
give
us
some
of
the
clay
of
his
grave
they
requested
so
she
went
with
them
to
the
temple
zendoji
and
showed
them
grave
and
they
took
some
of
the
away
with
them
wrapped
up
in
a
furoshiki
they
gave
riki
mother
some
money
ten
but
what
did
they
want
with
that
clay
i
inquired
well
the
old
man
answered
you
know
that
it
would
not
do
to
let
the
child
grow
up
with
that
name
on
his
hand
and
there
is
no
other
means
of
removing
characters
that
come
in
that
way
upon
the
body
of
a
child
you
must
rub
the
skin
with
clay
taken
from
the
grave
of
the
body
of
the
former
on
the
wooded
hill
behind
the
house
robert
and
i
are
looking
for
robert
is
eight
years
old
comely
and
very
wise
i
am
a
little
more
than
seven
and
i
reverence
robert
it
is
a
glowing
glorious
august
day
and
the
warm
air
is
filled
with
sharp
sweet
scents
of
resin
we
do
not
find
any
but
we
find
a
great
many
in
the
high
grass
i
tell
robert
the
old
welsh
story
of
the
man
who
went
to
sleep
unawares
inside
a
and
so
disappeared
for
seven
years
and
would
never
eat
or
speak
after
his
friends
had
delivered
him
from
the
enchantment
they
eat
nothing
but
the
points
of
needles
you
know
says
robert
who
i
ask
goblins
robert
answers
this
revelation
leaves
me
dumb
with
astonishment
and
awe
but
robert
suddenly
cries
out
there
is
a
harper
he
is
coming
to
the
house
and
down
the
hill
we
run
to
hear
the
harper
but
what
a
harper
not
like
the
hoary
minstrels
of
the
a
swarthy
sturdy
unkempt
vagabond
with
black
bold
eyes
under
scowling
black
brows
more
like
a
bricklayer
than
a
bard
and
his
garments
are
corduroy
wonder
if
he
is
going
to
sing
in
welsh
murmurs
robert
i
feel
too
much
disappointed
to
make
any
remarks
the
harper
poses
his
harp
a
huge
instrument
upon
our
doorstep
sets
all
the
strong
ringing
with
a
sweep
of
his
grimy
fingers
clears
his
throat
with
a
sort
of
angry
growl
and
begins
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
which
i
gaze
on
so
fondly
the
accent
the
attitude
the
voice
all
fill
me
with
repulsion
unutterable
shock
me
with
a
new
sensation
of
formidable
vulgarity
i
want
to
cry
out
loud
you
have
no
right
to
sing
that
song
for
i
have
heard
it
sung
by
the
lips
of
the
dearest
and
fairest
being
in
my
little
world
and
that
this
rude
coarse
man
should
dare
to
sing
it
vexes
me
like
a
mockery
angers
me
like
an
insolence
but
only
for
a
moment
with
the
utterance
of
the
syllables
that
deep
grim
voice
suddenly
breaks
into
a
quivering
tenderness
indescribable
then
marvelously
changing
it
mellows
into
tones
sonorous
and
rich
as
the
bass
of
a
great
organ
while
a
sensation
unlike
anything
ever
felt
before
takes
me
by
the
throat
what
witchcraft
has
he
learned
what
secret
has
he
found
this
scowling
man
of
the
road
oh
is
there
anybody
else
in
the
whole
world
who
can
sing
like
that
and
the
form
of
the
singer
flickers
and
dims
and
the
house
and
the
lawn
and
all
visible
shapes
of
things
tremble
and
swim
before
me
yet
instinctively
i
fear
that
man
i
almost
hate
him
and
i
feel
myself
flushing
with
anger
and
shame
because
of
his
power
to
move
me
thus
he
made
you
cry
robert
compassionately
observes
to
my
further
confusion
as
the
harper
strides
away
richer
by
a
gift
of
sixpence
taken
without
thanks
but
i
think
he
must
be
a
gipsy
gipsies
are
bad
people
and
they
are
wizards
let
us
go
back
to
the
wood
we
climb
again
to
the
pines
and
there
squat
down
upon
the
grass
and
look
over
town
and
sea
but
we
do
not
play
as
before
the
spell
of
the
wizard
is
strong
upon
us
both
perhaps
he
is
a
goblin
i
venture
at
last
or
a
fairy
no
says
robert
only
a
gipsy
but
that
is
nearly
as
bad
they
steal
children
you
what
shall
we
do
if
he
comes
up
here
i
gasp
in
sudden
terror
at
the
lonesomeness
of
our
situation
oh
he
would
dare
answers
robert
not
by
daylight
you
only
yesterday
near
the
village
of
takata
i
noticed
a
flower
which
the
japanese
call
by
nearly
the
same
name
as
we
do
himawari
the
and
over
the
space
of
forty
years
there
thrilled
back
to
me
the
voice
of
that
wandering
harper
as
the
sunflower
turns
on
her
god
when
he
sets
the
same
look
that
she
turned
when
he
rose
again
i
saw
the
shadows
on
that
far
welsh
hill
and
robert
for
a
moment
again
stood
beside
me
with
his
girl
face
and
his
curls
of
gold
we
were
looking
for
but
all
that
existed
of
the
real
robert
must
long
ago
have
suffered
a
into
something
rich
and
strange
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friend
horai
blue
vision
of
depth
lost
in
height
sea
and
sky
interblending
through
luminous
haze
the
day
is
of
spring
and
the
hour
morning
only
sky
and
sea
one
azure
enormity
in
the
fore
ripples
are
catching
a
silvery
light
and
threads
of
foam
are
swirling
but
a
little
further
off
no
motion
is
visible
nor
anything
save
color
dim
warm
blue
of
water
widening
away
to
melt
into
blue
of
air
horizon
there
is
none
only
distance
soaring
into
space
infinite
concavity
hollowing
before
you
and
hugely
arching
above
you
the
color
deepening
with
the
height
but
far
in
the
there
hangs
a
faint
faint
vision
of
palace
towers
with
high
roofs
horned
and
curved
like
moons
some
shadowing
of
splendor
strange
and
old
illumined
by
a
sunshine
soft
as
memory
what
i
have
thus
been
trying
to
describe
is
a
kakemono
that
is
to
say
a
japanese
painting
on
silk
suspended
to
the
wall
of
my
alcove
and
the
name
of
it
is
shinkiro
which
signifies
mirage
but
the
shapes
of
the
mirage
are
unmistakable
those
are
the
glimmering
portals
of
horai
the
blest
and
those
are
the
moony
roofs
of
the
palace
of
the
and
the
fashion
of
them
though
limned
by
a
japanese
brush
of
is
the
fashion
of
things
chinese
hundred
years
ago
thus
much
is
told
of
the
place
in
the
chinese
books
of
that
time
in
horai
there
is
neither
death
nor
pain
and
there
is
no
winter
the
flowers
in
that
place
never
fade
and
the
fruits
never
fail
and
if
a
man
taste
of
those
fruits
even
but
once
he
can
never
again
feel
thirst
or
hunger
in
horai
grow
the
enchanted
plants
and
and
which
heal
all
manner
of
sickness
and
there
grows
also
the
magical
grass
that
quickens
the
dead
and
the
magical
grass
is
watered
by
a
fairy
water
of
which
a
single
drink
confers
perpetual
youth
the
people
of
horai
eat
their
rice
out
of
very
very
small
bowls
but
the
rice
never
diminishes
within
those
bowls
however
much
of
it
be
eaten
until
the
eater
desires
no
more
and
the
people
of
horai
drink
their
wine
out
of
very
very
small
cups
but
no
man
can
empty
one
of
those
cups
however
stoutly
he
may
drink
until
there
comes
upon
him
the
pleasant
drowsiness
of
intoxication
all
this
and
more
is
told
in
the
legends
of
the
time
of
the
shin
dynasty
but
that
the
people
who
wrote
down
those
legends
ever
saw
horai
even
in
a
mirage
is
not
believable
for
really
there
are
no
enchanted
fruits
which
leave
the
eater
forever
satisfied
nor
any
magical
grass
which
revives
the
dead
nor
any
fountain
of
fairy
water
nor
any
bowls
which
never
lack
rice
nor
any
cups
which
never
lack
wine
it
is
not
true
that
sorrow
and
death
never
enter
horai
neither
is
it
true
that
there
is
not
any
winter
the
winter
in
horai
is
cold
and
winds
then
bite
to
the
bone
and
the
heaping
of
snow
is
monstrous
on
the
roofs
of
the
nevertheless
there
are
wonderful
things
in
horai
and
the
most
wonderful
of
all
has
not
been
mentioned
by
any
chinese
writer
i
mean
the
atmosphere
of
horai
it
is
an
atmosphere
peculiar
to
the
place
and
because
of
it
the
sunshine
in
horai
is
whiter
than
any
other
sunshine
a
milky
light
that
never
dazzles
astonishingly
clear
but
very
soft
this
atmosphere
is
not
of
our
human
period
it
is
enormously
old
so
old
that
i
feel
afraid
when
i
try
to
think
how
old
it
is
and
it
is
not
a
mixture
of
nitrogen
and
oxygen
it
is
not
made
of
air
at
all
but
of
ghost
the
substance
of
quintillions
of
quintillions
of
generations
of
souls
blended
into
one
immense
translucency
souls
of
people
who
thought
in
ways
never
resembling
our
ways
whatever
mortal
man
inhales
that
atmosphere
he
takes
into
his
blood
the
thrilling
of
these
spirits
and
they
change
the
sense
within
him
reshaping
his
notions
of
space
and
time
so
that
he
can
see
only
as
they
used
to
see
and
feel
only
as
they
used
to
feel
and
think
only
as
they
used
to
think
soft
as
sleep
are
these
changes
of
sense
and
horai
discerned
across
them
might
thus
be
described
because
in
horai
there
is
no
knowledge
of
great
evil
the
hearts
of
the
people
never
grow
old
and
by
reason
of
being
always
young
in
heart
the
people
of
horai
smile
from
birth
until
death
except
when
the
gods
send
sorrow
among
them
and
faces
then
are
veiled
until
the
sorrow
goes
away
all
folk
in
horai
love
and
trust
each
other
as
if
all
were
members
of
a
single
household
and
the
speech
of
the
women
is
like
birdsong
because
the
hearts
of
them
are
light
as
the
souls
of
birds
and
the
swaying
of
the
sleeves
of
the
maidens
at
play
seems
a
flutter
of
wide
soft
wings
in
horai
nothing
is
hidden
but
grief
because
there
is
no
reason
for
shame
and
nothing
is
locked
away
because
there
could
not
be
any
theft
and
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
all
doors
remain
unbarred
because
there
is
no
reason
for
fear
and
because
the
people
are
fairies
though
mortal
all
things
in
horai
except
the
palace
of
the
are
small
and
quaint
and
queer
and
these
do
really
eat
their
rice
out
of
very
very
small
bowls
and
drink
their
wine
out
of
very
very
small
cups
much
of
this
seeming
would
be
due
to
the
inhalation
of
that
ghostly
atmosphere
but
not
all
for
the
spell
wrought
by
the
dead
is
only
the
charm
of
an
ideal
the
glamour
of
an
ancient
hope
and
something
of
that
hope
has
found
fulfillment
in
many
hearts
in
the
simple
beauty
of
unselfish
lives
in
the
sweetness
of
woman
evil
winds
from
the
west
are
blowing
over
horai
and
the
magical
atmosphere
alas
is
shrinking
away
before
them
it
lingers
now
in
patches
only
and
bands
like
those
long
bright
bands
of
cloud
that
train
across
the
landscapes
of
japanese
painters
under
these
shreds
of
the
elfish
vapor
you
still
can
find
horai
but
not
everywhere
remember
that
horai
is
also
called
shinkiro
which
signifies
mirage
the
vision
of
the
intangible
and
the
vision
is
fading
never
again
to
appear
save
in
pictures
and
poems
and
dreams
insect
studies
butterflies
i
would
that
i
could
hope
for
the
luck
of
that
chinese
scholar
known
to
japanese
literature
as
rosan
for
he
was
beloved
by
two
celestial
sisters
who
every
ten
days
came
to
visit
him
and
to
tell
him
stories
about
butterflies
now
there
are
marvelous
chinese
stories
about
butterflies
ghostly
stories
and
i
want
to
know
them
but
never
shall
i
be
able
to
read
chinese
nor
even
japanese
and
the
little
japanese
poetry
that
i
manage
with
exceeding
difficulty
to
translate
contains
so
many
allusions
to
chinese
stories
of
butterflies
that
i
am
tormented
with
the
torment
of
tantalus
and
of
course
no
will
even
deign
to
visit
so
skeptical
a
person
as
myself
i
want
to
know
for
example
the
whole
story
of
that
chinese
maiden
whom
the
butterflies
took
to
be
a
flower
and
followed
in
multitude
so
fragrant
and
so
fair
was
she
also
i
should
like
to
know
something
more
concerning
the
butterflies
of
the
emperor
genso
or
ming
hwang
who
made
them
choose
his
loves
for
him
he
used
to
hold
in
his
amazing
garden
and
ladies
of
exceeding
beauty
were
in
attendance
and
caged
butterflies
set
free
among
them
would
fly
to
the
fairest
and
then
upon
that
fairest
the
imperial
favor
was
bestowed
but
after
genso
kotei
had
seen
yokihi
whom
the
chinese
call
he
would
not
suffer
the
butterflies
to
choose
for
him
which
was
unlucky
as
yokihi
got
him
into
serious
trouble
again
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
the
experience
of
that
chinese
scholar
celebrated
in
japan
under
the
name
soshu
who
dreamed
that
he
was
a
butterfly
and
had
all
the
sensations
of
a
butterfly
in
that
dream
for
his
spirit
had
really
been
wandering
about
in
the
shape
of
a
butterfly
and
when
he
awoke
the
memories
and
the
feelings
of
butterfly
existence
remained
so
vivid
in
his
mind
that
he
could
not
act
like
a
human
being
finally
i
should
like
to
know
the
text
of
a
certain
chinese
official
recognition
of
sundry
butterflies
as
the
spirits
of
an
emperor
and
of
his
attendants
most
of
the
japanese
literature
about
butterflies
excepting
some
poetry
appears
to
be
of
chinese
origin
and
even
that
old
national
aesthetic
feeling
on
the
subject
which
found
such
delightful
expression
in
japanese
art
and
song
and
custom
may
have
been
first
developed
under
chinese
teaching
chinese
precedent
doubtless
explains
why
japanese
poets
and
painters
chose
so
often
for
their
geimyo
or
professional
appellations
such
names
as
chomu
icho
solitary
butterfly
etc
and
even
to
this
day
such
geimyo
as
chohana
chokichi
or
chonosuke
are
affected
by
besides
artistic
names
having
reference
to
butterflies
there
are
still
in
use
real
personal
names
yobina
of
this
kind
such
as
kocho
or
cho
meaning
butterfly
they
are
borne
by
women
only
as
a
rule
though
there
are
some
strange
exceptions
and
here
i
may
mention
that
in
the
province
of
mutsu
there
still
exists
the
curious
old
custom
of
calling
the
youngest
daughter
in
a
family
tekona
which
quaint
word
obsolete
elsewhere
signifies
in
mutsu
dialect
a
butterfly
in
classic
time
this
word
signified
also
a
beautiful
woman
it
is
possible
also
that
some
weird
japanese
beliefs
about
butterflies
are
of
chinese
derivation
but
these
beliefs
might
be
older
than
china
herself
the
most
interesting
one
i
think
is
that
the
soul
of
a
living
person
may
wander
about
in
the
form
of
a
butterfly
some
pretty
fancies
have
been
evolved
out
of
this
belief
such
as
the
notion
that
if
a
butterfly
enters
your
and
perches
behind
the
bamboo
screen
the
person
whom
you
most
love
is
coming
to
see
you
that
a
butterfly
may
be
the
spirit
of
somebody
is
not
a
reason
for
being
afraid
of
it
nevertheless
there
are
times
when
even
butterflies
can
inspire
fear
by
appearing
in
prodigious
numbers
and
japanese
history
records
such
an
event
when
was
secretly
preparing
for
his
famous
revolt
there
appeared
in
kyoto
so
vast
a
swarm
of
butterflies
that
the
people
were
frightened
thinking
the
apparition
to
be
a
portent
of
coming
evil
perhaps
those
butterflies
were
supposed
to
be
the
spirits
of
the
thousands
doomed
to
perish
in
battle
and
agitated
on
the
eve
of
war
by
some
mysterious
premonition
of
death
however
in
japanese
belief
a
butterfly
may
be
the
soul
of
a
dead
person
as
well
as
of
a
living
person
indeed
it
is
a
custom
of
souls
to
take
in
order
to
announce
the
fact
of
their
final
departure
from
the
body
and
for
this
reason
any
butterfly
which
enters
a
house
ought
to
be
kindly
treated
to
this
belief
and
to
queer
fancies
connected
with
it
there
are
many
allusions
in
popular
drama
for
example
there
is
a
play
called
or
the
flying
hairpin
of
kocho
kocho
is
a
beautiful
person
who
kills
herself
because
of
false
accusations
and
cruel
treatment
her
avenger
long
seeks
in
vain
for
the
author
of
the
wrong
but
at
last
the
dead
woman
hairpin
turns
into
a
butterfly
and
serves
as
a
guide
to
vengeance
by
hovering
above
the
place
where
the
villain
is
hiding
of
course
those
big
paper
butterflies
and
which
figure
at
weddings
must
not
be
thought
of
as
having
any
ghostly
signification
as
emblems
they
only
express
the
joy
of
living
union
and
the
hope
that
the
newly
married
couple
may
pass
through
life
together
as
a
pair
of
butterflies
flit
lightly
through
some
pleasant
garden
now
hovering
upward
now
downward
but
never
widely
separating
ii
a
small
selection
of
hokku
on
butterflies
will
help
to
illustrate
japanese
interest
in
the
aesthetic
side
of
the
subject
some
are
pictures
only
tiny
made
with
seventeen
syllables
some
are
nothing
more
than
pretty
fancies
or
graceful
suggestions
but
the
reader
will
find
variety
probably
he
will
not
care
much
for
the
verses
in
themselves
the
taste
for
japanese
poetry
of
the
epigrammatic
sort
is
a
taste
that
must
be
slowly
acquired
and
it
is
only
by
degrees
after
patient
study
that
the
possibilities
of
such
composition
can
be
fairly
estimated
hasty
criticism
has
declared
that
to
put
forward
any
serious
claim
on
behalf
of
poems
would
be
absurd
but
what
then

quite
as
wonderful
indeed
much
more
wonderful
have
been
done
not
once
or
twice
but
probably
a
thousand
times

there
is

wonderful

literary

besides
these
specimens
of
poetry
about
butterflies
i
have
one
queer
example
to
offer
of
japanese
prose
literature
on
the
same
topic
the
original
of
which
i
have
attempted
only
a
free
translation
can
be
found
in
the
curious
old
book
and
it
assumes
the
form
of
a
discourse
to
a
butterfly
but
it
is
really
a
didactic
allegory
suggesting
the
moral
significance
of
a
social
rise
and
fall
now
under
the
sun
of
spring
the
winds
are
gentle
and
flowers
pinkly
bloom
and
grasses
are
soft
and
the
hearts
of
people
are
glad
butterflies
everywhere
flutter
joyously
so
many
persons
now
compose
chinese
verses
and
japanese
verses
about
butterflies
and
this
season
o
butterfly
is
indeed
the
season
of
your
bright
prosperity
so
comely
you
now
are
that
in
the
whole
world
there
is
nothing
more
comely
for
that
reason
all
other
insects
admire
and
envy
you
there
is
not
among
them
even
one
that
does
not
envy
you
nor
do
insects
alone
regard
you
with
envy
men
also
both
envy
and
admire
you
soshu
of
china
in
a
dream
assumed
your
shape
sakoku
of
japan
after
dying
took
your
form
and
therein
made
ghostly
apparition
nor
is
the
envy
that
you
inspire
shared
only
by
insects
and
mankind
even
things
without
soul
change
their
form
into
yours
witness
the
which
turns
into
a
butterfly
and
therefore
you
are
lifted
up
with
pride
and
think
to
yourself
all
this
world
there
is
nothing
superior
to
me
ah
i
can
very
well
guess
what
is
in
your
heart
you
are
too
much
satisfied
with
your
own
person
that
is
why
you
let
yourself
be
blown
thus
lightly
about
by
every
wind
that
is
why
you
never
remain
still
always
always
thinking
the
whole
world
there
is
no
one
so
fortunate
as
i
but
now
try
to
think
a
little
about
your
own
personal
history
it
is
worth
recalling
for
there
is
a
vulgar
side
to
it
how
a
vulgar
side
well
for
a
considerable
time
after
you
were
born
you
had
no
such
reason
for
rejoicing
in
your
form
you
were
then
a
mere
a
hairy
worm
and
you
were
so
poor
that
you
could
not
afford
even
one
robe
to
cover
your
nakedness
and
your
appearance
was
altogether
disgusting
everybody
in
those
days
hated
the
sight
of
you
indeed
you
had
good
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
so
ashamed
you
were
that
you
collected
old
twigs
and
rubbish
to
hide
in
and
you
made
a
and
hung
it
to
a
branch
and
then
everybody
cried
out
to
you
insect
and
during
that
period
of
your
life
your
sins
were
grievous
among
the
tender
green
leaves
of
beautiful
you
and
your
fellows
assembled
and
there
made
ugliness
extraordinary
and
the
expectant
eyes
of
the
people
who
came
from
far
away
to
admire
the
beauty
of
those
were
hurt
by
the
sight
of
you
and
of
things
even
more
hateful
than
this
you
were
guilty
you
knew
that
poor
poor
men
and
women
had
been
cultivating
daikon
in
their
fields
toiling
under
the
hot
sun
till
their
hearts
were
filled
with
bitterness
by
reason
of
having
to
care
for
that
daikon
and
you
persuaded
your
companions
to
go
with
you
and
to
gather
upon
the
leaves
of
that
daikon
and
on
the
leaves
of
other
vegetables
planted
by
those
poor
people
out
of
your
greediness
you
ravaged
those
leaves
and
gnawed
them
into
all
shapes
of
ugliness
caring
nothing
for
the
trouble
of
those
poor
folk
yes
such
a
creature
you
were
and
such
were
your
doings
and
now
that
you
have
a
comely
form
you
despise
your
old
comrades
the
insects
and
whenever
you
happen
to
meet
any
of
them
you
pretend
not
to
know
them
literally
make
an
face
now
you
want
to
have
none
but
wealthy
and
exalted
people
for
friends
ah
you
have
forgotten
the
old
times
have
you
it
is
true
that
many
people
have
forgotten
your
past
and
are
charmed
by
the
sight
of
your
present
graceful
shape
and
white
wings
and
write
chinese
verses
and
japanese
verses
about
you
the
damsel
who
could
not
bear
even
to
look
at
you
in
your
former
shape
now
gazes
at
you
with
delight
and
wants
you
to
perch
upon
her
hairpin
and
holds
out
her
dainty
fan
in
the
hope
that
you
will
light
upon
it
but
this
reminds
me
that
there
is
an
ancient
chinese
story
about
you
which
is
not
pretty
in
the
time
of
the
emperor
genso
the
imperial
palace
contained
hundreds
and
thousands
of
beautiful
ladies
so
many
indeed
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
man
to
decide
which
among
them
was
the
loveliest
so
all
of
those
beautiful
persons
were
assembled
together
in
one
place
and
you
were
set
free
to
fly
among
them
and
it
was
decreed
that
the
damsel
upon
whose
hairpin
you
perched
should
be
augustly
summoned
to
the
imperial
chamber
in
that
time
there
could
not
be
more
than
one
empress
which
was
a
good
law
but
because
of
you
the
emperor
genso
did
great
mischief
in
the
land
for
your
mind
is
light
and
frivolous
and
although
among
so
many
beautiful
women
there
must
have
been
some
persons
of
pure
heart
you
would
look
for
nothing
but
beauty
and
so
betook
yourself
to
the
person
most
beautiful
in
outward
appearance
therefore
many
of
the
female
attendants
ceased
altogether
to
think
about
the
right
way
of
women
and
began
to
study
how
to
make
themselves
appear
splendid
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
emperor
genso
died
a
pitiful
and
painful
death
all
because
of
your
light
and
trifling
mind
indeed
your
real
character
can
easily
be
seen
from
your
conduct
in
other
matters
there
are
trees
for
example
such
as
the
and
the
pine
whose
leaves
do
not
fade
and
fall
but
remain
always
green
these
are
trees
of
firm
heart
trees
of
solid
character
but
you
say
that
they
are
stiff
and
formal
and
you
hate
the
sight
of
them
and
never
pay
them
a
visit
only
to
the
and
the
kaido
and
the
peony
and
the
yellow
rose
you
go
those
you
like
because
they
have
showy
flowers
and
you
try
only
to
please
them
such
conduct
let
me
assure
you
is
very
unbecoming
those
trees
certainly
have
handsome
flowers
but
fruits
they
have
not
and
they
are
grateful
to
those
only
who
are
fond
of
luxury
and
show
and
that
is
just
the
reason
why
they
are
pleased
by
your
fluttering
wings
and
delicate
shape
that
is
why
they
are
kind
to
you
now
in
this
spring
season
while
you
sportively
dance
through
the
gardens
of
the
wealthy
or
hover
among
the
beautiful
alleys
of
in
blossom
you
say
to
yourself
in
the
world
has
such
pleasure
as
i
or
such
excellent
friends
and
in
spite
of
all
that
people
may
say
i
most
love
the
peony
and
the
golden
yellow
rose
is
my
own
darling
and
i
will
obey
her
every
least
behest
for
that
is
my
pride
and
my
so
you
say
but
the
opulent
and
elegant
season
of
flowers
is
very
short
soon
they
will
fade
and
fall
then
in
the
time
of
summer
heat
there
will
be
green
leaves
only
and
presently
the
winds
of
autumn
will
blow
when
even
the
leaves
themselves
will
shower
down
like
rain
and
your
fate
will
then
be
as
the
fate
of
the
unlucky
in
the
proverb
tanomi
ki
no
shita
ni
ame
furu
even
through
the
tree
upon
which
i
relied
for
shelter
the
rain
leaks
down
for
you
will
seek
out
your
old
friend
the
insect
the
grub
and
beg
him
to
let
you
return
into
your
hole
but
now
having
wings
you
will
not
be
able
to
enter
the
hole
because
of
them
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
shelter
your
body
anywhere
between
heaven
and
earth
and
all
the
will
then
have
withered
and
you
will
not
have
even
one
drop
of
dew
with
which
to
moisten
your
tongue
and
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
you
to
do
but
to
lie
down
and
die
all
because
of
your
light
and
frivolous
heart
but
ah
how
lamentable
an
end
iii
most
of
the
japanese
stories
about
butterflies
appear
as
i
have
said
to
be
of
chinese
origin
but
i
have
one
which
is
probably
indigenous
and
it
seems
to
me
worth
telling
for
the
benefit
of
persons
who
believe
there
is
no
romantic
love
in
the
far
east
behind
the
cemetery
of
the
temple
of
sozanji
in
the
suburbs
of
the
capital
there
long
stood
a
solitary
cottage
occupied
by
an
old
man
named
takahama
he
was
liked
in
the
neighborhood
by
reason
of
his
amiable
ways
but
almost
everybody
supposed
him
to
be
a
little
mad
unless
a
man
take
the
buddhist
vows
he
is
expected
to
marry
and
to
bring
up
a
family
but
takahama
did
not
belong
to
the
religious
life
and
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
marry
neither
had
he
ever
been
known
to
enter
into
a
with
any
woman
for
more
than
fifty
years
he
had
lived
entirely
alone
one
summer
he
fell
sick
and
knew
that
he
had
not
long
to
live
he
then
sent
for
his
a
widow
and
for
her
only
son
a
lad
of
about
twenty
years
old
to
whom
he
was
much
attached
both
promptly
came
and
did
whatever
they
could
to
soothe
the
old
man
last
hours
one
sultry
afternoon
while
the
widow
and
her
son
were
watching
at
his
bedside
takahama
fell
asleep
at
the
same
moment
a
very
large
white
butterfly
entered
the
room
and
perched
upon
the
sick
man
pillow
the
nephew
drove
it
away
with
a
fan
but
it
returned
immediately
to
the
pillow
and
was
again
driven
away
only
to
come
back
a
third
time
then
the
nephew
chased
it
into
the
garden
and
across
the
garden
through
an
open
gate
into
the
cemetery
of
the
neighboring
temple
but
it
continued
to
flutter
before
him
as
if
unwilling
to
be
driven
further
and
acted
so
queerly
that
he
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
really
a
butterfly
or
a
ma
he
again
chased
it
and
followed
it
far
into
the
cemetery
until
he
saw
it
fly
against
a
tomb
a
tomb
there
it
unaccountably
disappeared
and
he
searched
for
it
in
vain
he
then
examined
the
monument
it
bore
the
personal
name
akiko
together
with
an
unfamiliar
family
name
and
an
inscription
stating
that
akiko
had
died
at
the
age
of
eighteen
apparently
the
tomb
had
been
erected
about
fifty
years
previously
moss
had
begun
to
gather
upon
it
but
it
had
been
well
cared
for
there
were
fresh
flowers
before
it
and
the
had
recently
been
filled
on
returning
to
the
sick
room
the
young
man
was
shocked
by
the
announcement
that
his
uncle
had
ceased
to
breathe
death
had
come
to
the
sleeper
painlessly
and
the
dead
face
smiled
the
young
man
told
his
mother
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
cemetery
ah
exclaimed
the
widow
then
it
must
have
been
akiko
but
who
was
akiko
mother
the
nephew
asked
the
widow
answered
when
your
good
uncle
was
young
he
was
betrothed
to
a
charming
girl
called
akiko
the
daughter
of
a
neighbor
akiko
died
of
consumption
only
a
little
before
the
day
appointed
for
the
wedding
and
her
promised
husband
sorrowed
greatly
after
akiko
had
been
buried
he
made
a
vow
never
to
marry
and
he
built
this
little
house
beside
the
cemetery
so
that
he
might
be
always
near
her
grave
all
this
happened
more
than
fifty
years
ago
and
every
day
of
those
fifty
years
winter
and
summer
alike
your
uncle
went
to
the
cemetery
and
prayed
at
the
grave
and
swept
the
tomb
and
set
offerings
before
it
but
he
did
not
like
to
have
any
mention
made
of
the
matter
and
he
never
spoke
of
it
so
at
last
akiko
came
for
him
the
white
butterfly
was
her
soul
iv
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
mention
an
ancient
japanese
dance
called
the
butterfly
dance
which
used
to
be
performed
in
the
imperial
palace
by
dancers
costumed
as
butterflies
whether
it
is
danced
occasionally
nowadays
i
do
not
know
it
is
said
to
be
very
difficult
to
learn
six
dancers
are
required
for
the
proper
performance
of
it
and
they
must
move
in
particular
figures
obeying
traditional
rules
for
every
step
pose
or
gesture
and
circling
about
each
other
very
slowly
to
the
sound
of
and
great
drums
small
flutes
and
great
flutes
and
pandean
pipes
of
a
form
unknown
to
western
pan
mosquitoes
with
a
view
to
i
have
been
reading
howard
book
mosquitoes
i
am
persecuted
by
mosquitoes
there
are
several
species
in
my
neighborhood
but
only
one
of
them
is
a
serious
torment
a
tiny
needly
thing
all
and
the
puncture
of
it
is
sharp
as
an
electric
burn
and
the
mere
hum
of
it
has
a
lancinating
quality
of
tone
which
foretells
the
quality
of
the
pain
about
to
come
much
in
the
same
way
that
a
particular
smell
suggests
a
particular
taste
i
find
that
this
mosquito
much
resembles
the
creature
which
howard
calls
stegomyia
fasciata
or
culex
fasciatus
and
that
its
habits
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
stegomyia
for
example
it
is
diurnal
rather
than
nocturnal
and
becomes
most
troublesome
in
the
afternoon
and
i
have
discovered
that
it
comes
from
the
buddhist
cemetery
a
very
old
cemetery
in
the
rear
of
my
garden
howard
book
declares
that
in
order
to
rid
a
neighborhood
of
mosquitoes
it
is
only
necessary
to
pour
a
little
petroleum
or
kerosene
oil
into
the
stagnant
water
where
they
breed
once
a
week
the
oil
should
be
used
at
the
rate
of
once
ounce
for
every
fifteen
square
feet
of
and
a
proportionate
quantity
for
any
less
surface
but
please
to
consider
the
conditions
in
my
neighborhood
i
have
said
that
my
tormentors
come
from
the
buddhist
cemetery
before
nearly
every
tomb
in
that
old
cemetery
there
is
a
or
cistern
called
mizutame
in
the
majority
of
cases
this
mizutame
is
simply
an
oblong
cavity
chiseled
in
the
broad
pedestal
supporting
the
monument
but
before
tombs
of
a
costly
kind
having
no
a
larger
separate
tank
is
placed
cut
out
of
a
single
block
of
stone
and
decorated
with
a
family
crest
or
with
symbolic
carvings
in
front
of
a
tomb
of
the
humblest
class
having
no
mizutame
water
is
placed
in
cups
or
other
vessels
for
the
dead
must
have
water
flowers
also
must
be
offered
to
them
and
before
every
tomb
you
will
find
a
pair
of
bamboo
cups
or
other
and
these
of
course
contain
water
there
is
a
well
in
the
cemetery
to
supply
water
for
the
graves
whenever
the
tombs
are
visited
by
relatives
and
friends
of
the
dead
fresh
water
is
poured
into
the
tanks
and
cups
but
as
an
old
cemetery
of
this
kind
contains
thousands
of
mizutame
and
tens
of
thousands
of
the
water
in
all
of
these
can
not
be
renewed
every
day
it
becomes
stagnant
and
populous
the
deeper
tanks
seldom
get
dry
the
rainfall
at
tokyo
being
heavy
enough
to
keep
them
partly
filled
during
nine
months
out
of
the
twelve
well
it
is
in
these
tanks
and
that
mine
enemies
are
born
they
rise
by
millions
from
the
water
of
the
dead
and
according
to
buddhist
doctrine
some
of
them
may
be
reincarnations
of
those
very
dead
condemned
by
the
error
of
former
lives
to
the
condition
of
or
pretas
anyhow
the
malevolence
of
the
culex
fasciatus
would
justify
the
suspicion
that
some
wicked
human
soul
had
been
compressed
into
that
wailing
speck
of
a
body
now
to
return
to
the
subject
of
you
can
exterminate
the
mosquitoes
of
any
locality
by
covering
with
a
film
of
kerosene
all
stagnant
water
surfaces
therein
the
larvae
die
on
rising
to
breathe
and
the
adult
females
perish
when
they
approach
the
water
to
launch
their
rafts
of
eggs
and
i
read
in
howard
book
that
the
actual
cost
of
freeing
from
mosquitoes
one
american
town
of
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
does
not
exceed
three
hundred
dollars
i
wonder
what
would
be
said
if
the
of
tokyo
which
is
aggressively
scientific
and
progressive
were
suddenly
to
command
that
all
in
the
buddhist
cemeteries
should
be
covered
at
regular
intervals
with
a
film
of
kerosene
oil
how
could
the
religion
which
prohibits
the
taking
of
any
life
even
of
invisible
life
yield
to
such
a
mandate
would
filial
piety
even
dream
of
consenting
to
obey
such
an
order
and
then
to
think
of
the
cost
in
labor
and
time
of
putting
kerosene
oil
every
seven
days
into
the
millions
of
mizutame
and
the
tens
of
millions
of
bamboo
in
the
tokyo
graveyards
impossible
to
free
the
city
from
mosquitoes
it
would
be
necessary
to
demolish
the
ancient
graveyards
and
that
would
signify
the
ruin
of
the
buddhist
temples
attached
to
them
and
that
would
mean
the
disparition
of
so
many
charming
gardens
with
their
and
monuments
and
humpy
bridges
and
holy
groves
and
buddhas
so
the
extermination
of
the
culex
fasciatus
would
involve
the
destruction
of
the
poetry
of
the
ancestral
cult
surely
too
great
a
price
to
pay
besides
i
should
like
when
my
time
comes
to
be
laid
away
in
some
buddhist
graveyard
of
the
ancient
kind
so
that
my
ghostly
company
should
be
ancient
caring
nothing
for
the
fashions
and
the
changes
and
the
disintegrations
of
meiji
that
old
cemetery
behind
my
garden
would
be
a
suitable
place
everything
there
is
beautiful
with
a
beauty
of
exceeding
and
startling
queerness
each
tree
and
stone
has
been
shaped
by
some
old
old
ideal
which
no
longer
exists
in
any
living
brain
even
the
shadows
are
not
of
this
time
and
sun
but
of
a
world
forgotten
that
never
knew
steam
or
electricity
or
magnetism
or
kerosene
oil
also
in
the
boom
of
the
big
bell
there
is
a
quaintness
of
tone
which
wakens
feelings
so
strangely
from
all
the
part
of
me
that
the
faint
blind
stirrings
of
them
make
me
afraid
deliciously
afraid
never
do
i
hear
that
billowing
peal
but
i
become
aware
of
a
striving
and
a
fluttering
in
the
abyssal
part
of
my
ghost
a
sensation
as
of
memories
struggling
to
reach
the
light
beyond
the
obscurations
of
a
million
million
deaths
and
births
i
hope
to
remain
within
hearing
of
that
bell
and
considering
the
possibility
of
being
doomed
to
the
state
of
a
i
want
to
have
my
chance
of
being
reborn
in
some
bamboo
or
mizutame
whence
i
might
issue
softly
singing
my
thin
and
pungent
song
to
bite
some
people
that
i
know
ants
i
this
morning
sky
after
the
night
tempest
is
a
pure
and
dazzling
blue
the
air
the
delicious
air
is
full
of
sweet
resinous
odors
shed
from
the
countless
broken
and
strewn
by
the
gale
in
the
neighboring
i
hear
the
of
the
bird
that
praises
the
sutra
of
the
lotos
and
the
land
is
very
still
by
reason
of
the
south
wind
now
the
summer
long
delayed
is
truly
with
us
butterflies
of
queer
japanese
colors
are
flickering
about
semi
are
wheezing
wasps
are
humming
gnats
are
dancing
in
the
sun
and
the
ants
are
busy
repairing
their
damaged
habitations
i
bethink
me
of
a
japanese
poem
yuku
e
naki
ari
no
sumai
ya
ame
now
the
poor
creature
has
nowhere
to
go
alas
for
the
dwellings
of
the
ants
in
this
rain
of
the
fifth
month
but
those
big
black
ants
in
my
garden
do
not
seem
to
need
any
sympathy
they
have
weathered
the
storm
in
some
unimaginable
way
while
great
trees
were
being
uprooted
and
houses
blown
to
fragments
and
roads
washed
out
of
existence
yet
before
the
typhoon
they
took
no
other
visible
precaution
than
to
block
up
the
gates
of
their
subterranean
town
and
the
spectacle
of
their
triumphant
toil
impels
me
to
attempt
an
essay
on
ants
i
should
have
liked
to
preface
my
disquisitions
with
something
from
the
old
japanese
literature
something
emotional
or
metaphysical
but
all
that
my
japanese
friends
were
able
to
find
for
me
on
the
subject
excepting
some
verses
of
little
worth
was
chinese
this
chinese
material
consisted
chiefly
of
strange
stories
and
one
of
them
seems
to
me
worth
quoting
faute
de
mieux
in
the
province
of
taishu
in
china
there
was
a
pious
man
who
every
day
during
many
years
fervently
worshiped
a
certain
goddess
one
morning
while
he
was
engaged
in
his
devotions
a
beautiful
woman
wearing
a
yellow
robe
came
into
his
chamber
and
stood
before
him
he
greatly
surprised
asked
her
what
she
wanted
and
why
she
had
entered
unannounced
she
answered
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
the
goddess
whom
you
have
so
long
and
so
faithfully
worshiped
and
i
have
now
come
to
prove
to
you
that
your
devotion
has
not
been
in
vain
are
you
acquainted
with
the
language
of
ants
the
worshiper
replied
i
am
only
a
and
ignorant
person
not
a
scholar
and
even
of
the
language
of
superior
men
i
know
nothing
at
these
words
the
goddess
smiled
and
drew
from
her
bosom
a
little
box
shaped
like
an
incense
box
she
opened
the
box
dipped
a
finger
into
it
and
took
therefrom
some
kind
of
ointment
with
which
she
anointed
the
ears
of
the
man
now
she
said
to
him
try
to
find
some
ants
and
when
you
find
any
stoop
down
and
listen
carefully
to
their
talk
you
will
be
able
to
understand
it
and
you
will
hear
of
something
to
your
advantage
only
remember
that
you
must
not
frighten
or
vex
the
ants
then
the
goddess
vanished
away
the
man
immediately
went
out
to
look
for
some
ants
he
had
scarcely
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
door
when
he
perceived
two
ants
upon
a
stone
supporting
one
of
the
he
stooped
over
them
and
listened
and
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
he
could
hear
them
talking
and
could
understand
what
they
said
let
us
try
to
find
a
warmer
place
proposed
one
of
the
ants
why
a
warmer
place
asked
the
other
what
is
the
matter
with
this
place
it
is
too
damp
and
cold
below
said
the
first
ant
there
is
a
big
treasure
buried
here
and
the
sunshine
can
not
warm
the
ground
about
it
then
the
two
ants
went
away
together
and
the
listener
ran
for
a
spade
by
digging
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pillar
he
soon
found
a
number
of
large
jars
full
of
gold
coin
the
discovery
of
this
treasure
made
him
a
very
rich
man
afterwards
he
often
tried
to
listen
to
the
conversation
of
ants
but
he
was
never
again
able
to
hear
them
speak
the
ointment
of
the
goddess
had
opened
his
ears
to
their
mysterious
language
for
only
a
single
day
now
i
like
that
chinese
devotee
must
confess
myself
a
very
ignorant
person
and
naturally
unable
to
hear
the
conversation
of
ants
but
the
fairy
of
science
sometimes
touches
my
ears
and
eyes
with
her
wand
and
then
for
a
little
time
i
am
able
to
hear
things
inaudible
and
to
perceive
things
imperceptible
ii
for
the
same
reason
that
it
is
considered
wicked
in
sundry
circles
to
speak
of
a
people
having
produced
a
civilization
ethically
superior
to
our
own
certain
persons
will
not
be
pleased
by
what
i
am
going
to
say
about
ants
but
there
are
men
incomparably
wiser
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
be
who
think
about
insects
and
civilizations
independently
of
the
blessings
of
christianity
and
i
find
encouragement
in
the
new
cambridge
natural
history
which
contains
the
following
remarks
by
professor
david
sharp
concerning
ants
observation
has
revealed
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
in
the
lives
of
these
insects
indeed
we
can
scarcely
avoid
the
conclusion
that
they
have
acquired
in
many
respects
the
art
of
living
together
in
societies
more
perfectly
than
our
own
species
has
and
that
they
have
anticipated
us
in
the
acquisition
of
some
of
the
industries
and
arts
that
greatly
facilitate
social
life
i
suppose
that
a
few
persons
will
dispute
this
plain
statement
by
a
trained
specialist
the
contemporary
man
of
science
is
not
apt
to
become
sentimental
about
ants
or
bees
but
he
will
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
that
in
regard
to
social
evolution
these
insects
appear
to
have
advanced
beyond
man
herbert
spencer
whom
nobody
will
charge
with
romantic
tendencies
goes
considerably
further
than
professor
sharp
showing
us
that
ants
are
in
a
very
real
sense
ethically
as
well
as
economically
in
advance
of
humanity
their
lives
being
entirely
devoted
to
altruistic
ends
indeed
professor
sharp
somewhat
needlessly
qualifies
his
praise
of
the
ant
with
this
cautious
observation
the
competence
of
the
ant
is
not
like
that
of
man
it
is
devoted
to
the
welfare
of
the
species
rather
than
to
that
of
the
individual
which
is
as
it
were
sacrificed
or
specialized
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
the
obvious
implication
that
any
social
state
in
which
the
improvement
of
the
individual
is
sacrificed
to
the
common
welfare
leaves
much
to
be
desired
is
probably
correct
from
the
actual
human
standpoint
for
man
is
yet
imperfectly
evolved
and
human
society
has
much
to
gain
from
his
further
individualization
but
in
regard
to
social
insects
the
implied
criticism
is
open
to
question
the
improvement
of
the
individual
says
herbert
spencer
consists
in
the
better
fitting
of
him
for
social
cooperation
and
this
being
conducive
to
social
prosperity
is
conducive
to
the
maintenance
of
the
race
in
other
words
the
value
of
the
individual
can
be
only
in
relation
to
the
society
and
this
granted
whether
the
sacrifice
of
the
individual
for
the
sake
of
that
society
be
good
or
evil
must
depend
upon
what
the
society
might
gain
or
lose
through
a
further
individualization
of
its
members
but
as
we
shall
presently
see
the
conditions
of
that
most
deserve
our
attention
are
the
ethical
conditions
and
these
are
beyond
human
criticism
since
they
realize
that
ideal
of
moral
evolution
described
by
spencer
as
a
state
in
which
egoism
and
altruism
are
so
conciliated
that
the
one
merges
into
the
other
that
is
to
say
a
state
in
which
the
only
possible
pleasure
is
the
pleasure
of
unselfish
action
or
again
to
quote
spencer
the
activities
of
the
are
activities
which
postpone
individual
so
completely
to
the
of
the
community
that
individual
life
appears
to
be
attended
to
only
just
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
make
possible
due
attention
to
social
life
the
individual
taking
only
just
such
food
and
just
such
rest
as
are
needful
to
maintain
its
vigor
iii
i
hope
my
reader
is
aware
that
ants
practise
horticulture
and
agriculture
that
they
are
skillful
in
the
cultivation
of
mushrooms
that
they
have
domesticated
according
to
present
knowledge
five
hundred
and
different
kinds
of
animals
that
they
make
tunnels
through
solid
rock
that
they
know
how
to
provide
against
atmospheric
changes
which
might
endanger
the
health
of
their
children
and
that
for
insects
their
longevity
is
exceptional
members
of
the
more
highly
evolved
species
living
for
a
considerable
number
of
years
but
it
is
not
especially
of
these
matters
that
i
wish
to
speak
what
i
want
to
talk
about
is
the
awful
propriety
the
terrible
morality
of
the
ant
our
most
appalling
ideals
of
conduct
fall
short
of
the
ethics
of
the
ant
as
progress
is
reckoned
in
time
by
nothing
less
than
millions
of
years
when
i
say
the
ant
i
mean
the
highest
type
of
ant
not
of
course
the
entire
about
two
thousand
species
of
ants
are
already
known
and
these
exhibit
in
their
social
organizations
widely
varying
degrees
of
evolution
certain
social
phenomena
of
the
greatest
biological
importance
and
of
no
less
importance
in
their
strange
relation
to
the
subject
of
ethics
can
be
studied
to
advantage
only
in
the
existence
of
the
most
highly
evolved
societies
of
ants
after
all
that
has
been
written
of
late
years
about
the
probable
value
of
relative
experience
in
the
long
life
of
the
ant
i
suppose
that
few
persons
would
venture
to
deny
individual
character
to
the
ant
the
intelligence
of
the
little
creature
in
meeting
and
overcoming
difficulties
of
a
totally
new
kind
and
in
adapting
itself
to
conditions
entirely
foreign
to
its
experience
proves
a
considerable
power
of
independent
thinking
but
this
at
least
is
certain
that
the
ant
has
no
individuality
capable
of
being
exercised
in
a
purely
selfish
direction
i
am
using
the
word
selfish
in
its
ordinary
acceptation
a
greedy
ant
a
sensual
ant
an
ant
capable
of
any
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
or
even
of
a
small
venial
sin
is
unimaginable
equally
unimaginable
of
course
a
romantic
ant
an
ideological
ant
a
poetical
ant
or
an
ant
inclined
to
metaphysical
speculations
no
human
mind
could
attain
to
the
absolute
quality
of
the
no
human
being
as
now
constituted
could
cultivate
a
mental
habit
so
impeccably
practical
as
that
of
the
ant
but
this
superlatively
practical
mind
is
incapable
of
moral
error
it
would
be
difficult
perhaps
to
prove
that
the
ant
has
no
religious
ideas
but
it
is
certain
that
such
ideas
could
not
be
of
any
use
to
it
the
being
incapable
of
moral
weakness
is
beyond
the
need
of
spiritual
guidance
only
in
a
vague
way
can
we
conceive
the
character
of
and
the
nature
of
and
to
do
even
this
we
must
try
to
imagine
some
yet
impossible
state
of
human
society
and
human
morals
let
us
then
imagine
a
world
full
of
people
incessantly
and
furiously
working
all
of
whom
seem
to
be
women
no
one
of
these
women
could
be
persuaded
or
deluded
into
taking
a
single
atom
of
food
more
than
is
needful
to
maintain
her
strength
and
no
one
of
them
ever
sleeps
a
second
longer
than
is
necessary
to
keep
her
nervous
system
in
good
and
all
of
them
are
so
peculiarly
constituted
that
the
least
unnecessary
indulgence
would
result
in
some
derangement
of
function
the
work
daily
performed
by
these
female
laborers
comprises
architectural
construction
of
numberless
kinds
horticulture
and
agriculture
the
feeding
and
sheltering
of
a
hundred
varieties
of
domestic
animals
the
manufacture
of
sundry
chemical
products
the
storage
and
conservation
of
countless
and
the
care
of
the
children
of
the
race
all
this
labor
is
done
for
the
commonwealth
no
citizen
of
which
is
capable
even
of
thinking
about
property
except
as
a
res
publica
and
the
sole
object
of
the
commonwealth
is
the
nurture
and
training
of
its
young
nearly
all
of
whom
are
girls
the
period
of
infancy
is
long
the
children
remain
for
a
great
while
not
only
helpless
but
shapeless
and
withal
so
delicate
that
they
must
be
very
carefully
guarded
against
the
least
change
of
temperature
fortunately
their
nurses
understand
the
laws
of
health
each
thoroughly
knows
all
that
she
ought
to
know
in
regard
to
ventilation
disinfection
drainage
moisture
and
the
danger
of
germs
germs
being
as
visible
perhaps
to
her
myopic
sight
as
they
become
to
our
own
eyes
under
the
microscope
indeed
all
matters
of
hygiene
are
so
well
comprehended
that
no
nurse
ever
makes
a
mistake
about
the
sanitary
conditions
of
her
neighborhood
in
spite
of
this
perpetual
labor
no
worker
remains
unkempt
each
is
scrupulously
neat
making
her
toilet
many
times
a
day
but
as
every
worker
is
born
with
the
most
beautiful
of
combs
and
brushes
attached
to
her
wrists
no
time
is
wasted
in
the
besides
keeping
themselves
strictly
clean
the
workers
must
also
keep
their
houses
and
gardens
in
faultless
order
for
the
sake
of
the
children
nothing
less
than
an
earthquake
an
eruption
an
inundation
or
a
desperate
war
is
allowed
to
interrupt
the
daily
routine
of
dusting
sweeping
scrubbing
and
disinfecting
iv
now
for
stranger
facts
this
world
of
incessant
toil
is
a
more
than
vestal
world
it
is
true
that
males
can
sometimes
be
perceived
in
it
but
they
appear
only
at
particular
seasons
and
they
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
workers
or
with
the
work
none
of
them
would
presume
to
address
a
worker
except
perhaps
under
extraordinary
circumstances
of
common
peril
and
no
worker
would
think
of
talking
to
a
male
for
males
in
this
queer
world
are
inferior
beings
equally
incapable
of
fighting
or
working
and
tolerated
only
as
necessary
evils
one
special
class
of
females
the
of
the
race
do
condescend
to
consort
with
males
during
a
very
brief
period
at
particular
seasons
but
the
do
not
work
and
they
must
accept
husbands
a
worker
could
not
even
dream
of
keeping
company
with
a
male
not
merely
because
such
association
would
signify
the
most
frivolous
waste
of
time
nor
yet
because
the
worker
necessarily
regards
all
males
with
unspeakable
contempt
but
because
the
worker
is
incapable
of
wedlock
some
workers
indeed
are
capable
of
parthenogenesis
and
give
birth
to
children
who
never
had
fathers
as
a
general
rule
however
the
worker
is
truly
feminine
by
her
moral
instincts
only
she
has
all
the
tenderness
the
patience
and
the
foresight
that
we
call
maternal
but
her
sex
has
disappeared
like
the
sex
of
the
in
the
buddhist
legend
for
defense
against
creatures
of
prey
or
enemies
of
the
state
the
workers
are
provided
with
weapons
and
they
are
furthermore
protected
by
a
large
military
force
the
warriors
are
so
much
bigger
than
the
workers
in
some
communities
at
least
that
it
is
difficult
at
first
sight
to
believe
them
of
the
same
race
soldiers
one
hundred
times
larger
than
the
workers
whom
they
guard
are
not
uncommon
but
all
these
soldiers
are
amazons
or
more
correctly
speaking
they
can
work
sturdily
but
being
built
for
fighting
and
for
heavy
pulling
chiefly
their
usefulness
is
restricted
to
those
directions
in
which
force
rather
than
skill
is
required
why
females
rather
than
males
should
have
been
evolutionally
specialized
into
soldiery
and
laborers
may
not
be
nearly
so
simple
a
question
as
it
appears
i
am
very
sure
of
not
being
able
to
answer
it
but
natural
economy
may
have
decided
the
matter
in
many
forms
of
life
the
female
greatly
exceeds
the
male
in
bulk
and
in
energy
perhaps
in
this
case
the
larger
reserve
of
possessed
originally
by
the
complete
female
could
be
more
rapidly
and
effectively
utilized
for
the
development
of
a
special
all
energies
which
in
the
fertile
female
would
be
expended
in
the
giving
of
life
seem
here
to
have
been
diverted
to
the
evolution
of
aggressive
power
or
of
the
true
females
the
there
are
very
few
indeed
and
these
are
treated
like
queens
so
constantly
and
so
reverentially
are
they
waited
upon
that
they
can
seldom
have
any
wishes
to
express
they
are
relieved
from
every
care
of
existence
except
the
duty
of
bearing
offspring
night
and
day
they
are
cared
for
in
every
possible
manner
they
alone
are
superabundantly
and
richly
fed
for
the
sake
of
the
offspring
they
must
eat
and
drink
and
repose
right
royally
and
their
physiological
specialization
allows
of
such
indulgence
ad
libitum
they
seldom
go
out
and
never
unless
attended
by
a
powerful
escort
as
they
can
not
be
permitted
to
incur
unnecessary
fatigue
or
danger
probably
they
have
no
great
desire
to
go
out
around
them
revolves
the
whole
activity
of
the
race
all
its
intelligence
and
toil
and
thrift
are
directed
solely
toward
the
of
these
mothers
and
of
their
children
but
last
and
least
of
the
race
rank
the
husbands
of
these
mothers
the
necessary
evils
the
males
they
appear
only
at
a
particular
season
as
i
have
already
observed
and
their
lives
are
very
short
some
can
not
even
boast
of
noble
descent
though
destined
to
royal
wedlock
for
they
are
not
royal
offspring
but
parthenogenetic
children
and
for
that
reason
especially
inferior
beings
the
chance
results
of
some
mysterious
atavism
but
of
any
sort
of
males
the
commonwealth
tolerates
but
few
barely
enough
to
serve
as
husbands
for
the
and
these
few
perish
almost
as
soon
as
their
duty
has
been
done
the
meaning
of
nature
law
in
this
extraordinary
world
is
identical
with
ruskin
teaching
that
life
without
effort
is
crime
and
since
the
males
are
useless
as
workers
or
fighters
their
existence
is
of
only
momentary
importance
they
are
not
indeed
sacrificed
like
the
aztec
victim
chosen
for
the
festival
of
tezcatlipoca
and
allowed
a
honeymoon
of
twenty
days
before
his
heart
was
torn
out
but
they
are
scarcely
less
unfortunate
in
their
high
fortune
imagine
youths
brought
up
in
the
knowledge
that
they
are
destined
to
become
royal
bridegrooms
for
a
single
night
that
after
their
bridal
they
will
have
no
moral
right
to
live
that
marriage
for
each
and
all
of
them
will
signify
certain
death
and
that
they
can
not
even
hope
to
be
lamented
by
their
young
widows
who
will
survive
them
for
a
time
of
many
generations
v
but
all
the
foregoing
is
no
more
than
a
proem
to
the
real
romance
of
the
by
far
the
most
startling
discovery
in
relation
to
this
astonishing
civilization
is
that
of
the
suppression
of
sex
in
certain
advanced
forms
of
sex
totally
disappears
in
the
majority
of
individuals
in
nearly
all
the
higher
appears
to
exist
only
to
the
extent
absolutely
needed
for
the
continuance
of
the
species
but
the
biological
fact
in
itself
is
much
less
startling
than
the
ethical
suggestion
which
it
offers
for
this
practical
suppression
or
regulation
of
appears
to
be
voluntary
voluntary
at
least
so
far
as
the
species
is
concerned
it
is
now
believed
that
these
wonderful
creatures
have
learned
how
to
develop
or
to
arrest
the
development
of
sex
in
their
young
by
some
particular
mode
of
nutrition
they
have
succeeded
in
placing
under
perfect
control
what
is
commonly
supposed
to
be
the
most
powerful
and
unmanageable
of
instincts
and
this
rigid
restraint
of
to
within
the
limits
necessary
to
provide
against
extinction
is
but
one
though
the
most
amazing
of
many
vital
economies
effected
by
the
race
every
capacity
for
egoistic
pleasure
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
egoistic
has
been
equally
repressed
through
physiological
modification
no
indulgence
of
any
natural
appetite
is
possible
except
to
that
degree
in
which
such
indulgence
can
directly
or
indirectly
benefit
the
species
even
the
indispensable
requirements
of
food
and
sleep
being
satisfied
only
to
the
exact
extent
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
healthy
activity
the
individual
can
exist
act
think
only
for
the
communal
good
and
the
commune
triumphantly
refuses
in
so
far
as
cosmic
law
permits
to
let
itself
be
ruled
either
by
love
or
hunger
most
of
us
have
been
brought
up
in
the
belief
that
without
some
kind
of
religious
creed
some
hope
of
future
reward
or
fear
of
future
punishment
no
civilization
could
exist
we
have
been
taught
to
think
that
in
the
absence
of
laws
based
upon
moral
ideas
and
in
the
absence
of
an
effective
police
to
enforce
such
laws
nearly
everybody
would
seek
only
his
or
her
personal
advantage
to
the
disadvantage
of
everybody
else
the
strong
would
then
destroy
the
weak
pity
and
sympathy
would
disappear
and
the
whole
social
fabric
would
fall
to
pieces
these
teachings
confess
the
existing
imperfection
of
human
nature
and
they
contain
obvious
truth
but
those
who
first
proclaimed
that
truth
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
ago
never
imagined
a
form
of
social
existence
in
which
selfishness
would
be
naturally
impossible
it
remained
for
irreligious
nature
to
furnish
us
with
proof
positive
that
there
can
exist
a
society
in
which
the
pleasure
of
active
beneficence
makes
needless
the
idea
of
duty
a
society
in
which
instinctive
morality
can
dispense
with
ethical
codes
of
every
sort
a
society
of
which
every
member
is
born
so
absolutely
unselfish
and
so
energetically
good
that
moral
training
could
signify
even
for
its
youngest
neither
more
nor
less
than
waste
of
precious
time
to
the
evolutionist
such
facts
necessarily
suggest
that
the
value
of
our
moral
idealism
is
but
temporary
and
that
something
better
than
virtue
better
than
kindness
better
than
in
the
present
human
meaning
of
those
terms
might
under
certain
conditions
eventually
replace
them
he
finds
himself
obliged
to
face
the
question
whether
a
world
without
moral
notions
might
not
be
morally
better
than
a
world
in
which
conduct
is
regulated
by
such
notions
he
must
even
ask
himself
whether
the
existence
of
religious
commandments
moral
laws
and
ethical
standards
among
ourselves
does
not
prove
us
still
in
a
very
primitive
stage
of
social
evolution
and
these
questions
naturally
lead
up
to
another
will
humanity
ever
be
able
on
this
planet
to
reach
an
ethical
condition
beyond
all
its
ideals
a
condition
in
which
everything
that
we
now
call
evil
will
have
been
atrophied
out
of
existence
and
everything
that
we
call
virtue
have
been
transmuted
into
instinct
a
state
of
altruism
in
which
ethical
concepts
and
codes
will
have
become
as
useless
as
they
would
be
even
now
in
the
societies
of
the
higher
ants
the
giants
of
modern
thought
have
given
some
attention
to
this
question
and
the
greatest
among
them
has
answered
it
partly
in
the
affirmative
herbert
spencer
has
expressed
his
belief
that
humanity
will
arrive
at
some
state
of
civilization
ethically
comparable
with
that
of
the
ant
if
we
have
in
lower
orders
of
creatures
cases
in
which
the
nature
is
constitutionally
so
modified
that
altruistic
activities
have
become
one
with
egoistic
activities
there
is
an
irresistible
implication
that
a
parallel
identification
will
under
parallel
conditions
take
place
among
human
beings
social
insects
furnish
us
with
instances
completely
to
the
point
and
instances
showing
us
indeed
to
what
a
marvelous
degree
the
life
of
the
individual
may
be
absorbed
in
subserving
the
lives
of
other
individuals
neither
the
ant
nor
the
bee
can
be
supposed
to
have
a
sense
of
duty
in
the
acceptation
we
give
to
that
word
nor
can
it
be
supposed
that
it
is
continually
undergoing
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
that
word
the
facts
show
us
that
it
is
within
the
possibilities
of
organization
to
produce
a
nature
which
shall
be
just
as
energetic
in
the
pursuit
of
altruistic
ends
as
is
in
other
cases
shown
in
the
pursuit
of
egoistic
ends
and
they
show
that
in
such
cases
these
altruistic
ends
are
pursued
in
pursuing
ends
which
on
their
other
face
are
egoistic
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
needs
of
the
organization
these
actions
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
others
must
be
carried
on
so
far
from
its
being
true
that
there
must
go
on
throughout
all
the
future
a
condition
in
which
is
to
be
continually
subjected
by
the
regard
for
others
it
will
be
the
case
that
a
regard
for
others
will
eventually
become
so
large
a
source
of
pleasure
as
to
overgrow
the
pleasure
which
is
derivable
from
direct
egoistic
gratification
eventually
then
there
will
come
also
a
state
in
which
egoism
and
altruism
are
so
conciliated
that
the
one
merges
in
the
other
vi
of
course
the
foregoing
prediction
does
not
imply
that
human
nature
will
ever
undergo
such
physiological
change
as
would
be
represented
by
structural
specializations
comparable
to
those
by
which
the
various
castes
of
insect
societies
are
differentiated
we
are
not
bidden
to
imagine
a
future
state
of
humanity
in
which
the
active
majority
would
consist
of
workers
and
amazons
toiling
for
an
inactive
minority
of
selected
mothers
even
in
his
chapter
human
population
in
the
future
spencer
has
attempted
no
detailed
statement
of
the
physical
modifications
inevitable
to
the
production
of
higher
moral
types
though
his
general
statement
in
regard
to
a
perfected
nervous
system
and
a
great
diminution
of
human
fertility
suggests
that
such
moral
evolution
would
signify
a
very
considerable
amount
of
physical
change
if
it
be
legitimate
to
believe
in
a
future
humanity
to
which
the
pleasure
of
mutual
beneficence
will
represent
the
whole
joy
of
life
would
it
not
also
be
legitimate
to
imagine
other
transformations
physical
and
moral
which
the
facts
of
have
proved
to
be
within
the
range
of
evolutional
possibility
i
do
not
know
i
most
worshipfully
reverence
herbert
spencer
as
the
greatest
philosopher
who
has
yet
appeared
in
this
world
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
write
down
anything
contrary
to
his
teaching
in
such
wise
that
the
reader
could
imagine
it
to
have
been
inspired
by
synthetic
philosophy
for
the
ensuing
reflections
i
alone
am
responsible
and
if
i
err
let
the
sin
be
upon
my
own
head
i
suppose
that
the
moral
transformations
predicted
by
spencer
could
be
effected
only
with
the
aid
of
physiological
change
and
at
a
terrible
cost
those
ethical
conditions
manifested
by
can
have
been
reached
only
through
effort
desperately
sustained
for
millions
of
years
against
the
most
atrocious
necessities
necessities
equally
merciless
may
have
to
be
met
and
mastered
eventually
by
the
human
race
spencer
has
shown
that
the
time
of
the
greatest
possible
human
suffering
is
yet
to
come
and
that
it
will
be
concomitant
with
the
period
of
the
greatest
possible
pressure
of
population
among
other
results
of
that
long
stress
i
understand
that
there
will
be
a
vast
increase
in
human
intelligence
and
sympathy
and
that
this
increase
of
intelligence
will
be
effected
at
the
cost
of
human
fertility
but
this
decline
in
reproductive
power
will
not
we
are
told
be
sufficient
to
assure
the
very
highest
of
social
conditions
it
will
only
relieve
that
pressure
of
population
which
has
been
the
main
cause
of
human
suffering
the
state
of
perfect
social
equilibrium
will
be
approached
but
never
quite
reached
by
mankind
unless
there
be
discovered
some
means
of
solving
economic
problems
just
as
social
insects
have
solved
them
by
the
suppression
of
supposing
that
such
a
discovery
were
made
and
that
the
human
race
should
decide
to
arrest
the
development
of
sex
in
the
majority
of
its
young
so
as
to
effect
a
transferrence
of
those
forces
now
demanded
by
to
the
development
of
higher
activities
might
not
the
result
be
an
eventual
state
of
polymorphism
like
that
of
ants
and
in
such
event
might
not
the
coming
race
be
indeed
represented
in
its
higher
types
through
feminine
rather
than
masculine
evolution
by
a
majority
of
beings
of
neither
sex
considering
how
many
persons
even
now
through
merely
unselfish
not
to
speak
of
religious
motives
sentence
themselves
to
celibacy
it
should
not
appear
improbable
that
a
more
highly
evolved
humanity
would
cheerfully
sacrifice
a
large
proportion
of
its
for
the
common
weal
particularly
in
view
of
certain
advantages
to
be
gained
not
the
least
of
such
advantages
always
supposing
that
mankind
were
able
to
control
after
the
natural
manner
of
the
ants
would
be
a
prodigious
increase
of
longevity
the
higher
types
of
a
humanity
superior
to
sex
might
be
able
to
realize
the
dream
of
life
for
a
thousand
years
already
we
find
lives
too
short
for
the
work
we
have
to
do
and
with
the
constantly
accelerating
progress
of
discovery
and
the
expansion
of
knowledge
we
shall
certainly
find
more
and
more
reason
to
regret
as
time
goes
on
the
brevity
of
existence
that
science
will
ever
discover
the
elixir
of
the
alchemists
hope
is
extremely
unlikely
the
cosmic
powers
will
not
allow
us
to
cheat
them
for
every
advantage
which
they
yield
us
the
full
price
must
be
paid
nothing
for
nothing
is
the
everlasting
law
perhaps
the
price
of
long
life
will
prove
to
be
the
price
that
the
ants
have
paid
for
it
perhaps
upon
some
elder
planet
that
price
has
already
been
paid
and
the
power
to
produce
offspring
restricted
to
a
caste
morphologically
differentiated
in
unimaginable
ways
from
the
rest
of
the
species
vii
but
while
the
facts
of
suggest
so
much
in
regard
to
the
future
course
of
human
evolution
do
they
not
also
suggest
something
of
largest
significance
concerning
the
relation
of
ethics
to
cosmic
law
apparently
the
highest
evolution
will
not
be
permitted
to
creatures
capable
of
what
human
moral
experience
has
in
all
areas
condemned
apparently
the
highest
possible
strength
is
the
strength
of
unselfishness
and
power
supreme
never
will
be
accorded
to
cruelty
or
to
lust
there
may
be
no
gods
but
the
forces
that
shape
and
dissolve
all
forms
of
being
would
seem
to
be
much
more
exacting
than
gods
to
prove
a
dramatic
tendency
in
the
ways
of
the
stars
is
not
possible
but
the
cosmic
process
seems
nevertheless
to
affirm
the
worth
of
every
human
system
of
ethics
fundamentally
opposed
to
human
egoism

the

see
my

an

several
of

the

would
need
considerable
space
to
explain
and
could
scarcely
interest
the
western
reader
the
meaning
which

desired
to
convey
might
be
thus
expressed
while
journeying

met

being
lovely

for
the
sake
of
that

one
wherefore
that

hour

can
it
mean
that
you
love
me
another
reading
is
possible
but
this
one
gives
the
signification
of
the
answer
intended
so
the
japanese
would
have
us
believe
although
the
verses
seem
commonplace
in
translation
i
have
tried
to
give
only
their
general
meaning

effective
literal

is
indefinite
according

circumstances
it

country

no
traveler
returns
or
that
fairyland
of

the

the
term
kokuo
means
the
ruler
of
a
country
therefore
a
king
the
original
phrase
tokoyo
no
kokuo
might
be
rendered
here
as
the
ruler
of
horai
or
the
king
of
fairyland
the
last
phrase
according
to

custom
had
to
be

the
double
value
of
the

used
by
classical
poets
both
in
the
meaning
of
fountain
and
in
that
of
the
divinity
of
a
fountain
or
spring
reminds
one
of
that
graceful
playing
with
words
which
japanese
poets
practice
more
usually
written
which
means
either
to
take
off
and
hang
up
or
to
begin
to
take
off
as
in
the
above
poem
more
loosely
but
more
effectively
the
verses
might
thus
be
rendered
like
a
woman
slipping
off
her
haori
that
is
the
appearance
of
a
butterfly
one
must
have
seen
the
japanese
garment
described
to
appreciate
the
comparison
the
haori
is
a
silk
a
kind
of
sleeved
cloak
worn
by
both
sexes
but
the
poem
suggests
a
woman
haori
which
is
usually
of
richer
color
or
material
the
sleeves
are
wide
and
the
lining
is
usually
of
silk
often
beautifully
variegated
in
taking
off
the
haori
the
brilliant
lining
is
displayed
and
at
such
an
instant
the
fluttering
splendor
might
well
be
likened
to
the
appearance
of
a
butterfly
in
motion
the
pole
is
smeared
with
and
the
verses
suggest
that
the
insect
is
preventing
the
man
from
using
his
pole
by
persistently
getting
in
the
way
of
it
as
the
birds
might
take
warning
from
seeing
the
butterfly
limed
jama
suru

to
hinder
or
prevent
even
while
it
is

wings
of
the
butterfly

be
seen
to
quiver
at
moments
as
if
the
creature
were
dreaming
of
flight
a
little
poem
by
basho
greatest
of
all
japanese
composers
of
hokku
the
verses
are
intended
to
suggest
the
joyous
feeling
of
literally
a
windless
day
but
two
negatives
in
japanese
poetry
do
not
necessarily
imply
an
affirmative
as
in
english
the
meaning
is
that
although
there
is
no
wind
the
fluttering
motion
of
the
butterflies
suggests
to
the
eyes
at
least
that
a
strong
breeze
is
playing
alluding
to
the
buddhist
proverb
rakkwa
eda
ni
kaerazu
futatabi
terasazu
the
fallen
flower
returns
not
to
the
branch
the
broken
mirror
never
again
reflects
so
says
the
proverb
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
saw
a
fallen
flower
return
to
the
branch
no
it
was
only
a
butterfly
alluding
probably
to
the
light
fluttering
motion
of
falling
that
is
to
say
the
grace
of
their
motion
makes
one
think
of
the
grace
of
young
girls
daintily
costumed
in
robes
with
long
fluttering
sleeves
and
old
japanese
proverb
declares
that
even
a
devil
is
pretty
at
eighteen
oni
mo
azami
no
hana
even
a
devil
at

or
perhaps
the
verses
might
be
more
effectively
rendered
