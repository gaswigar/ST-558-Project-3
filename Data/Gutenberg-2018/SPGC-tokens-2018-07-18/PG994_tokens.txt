riders
to
the
sea
a
play
in
one
act
by
synge
introduction
it
must
have
been
on
synge
second
visit
to
the
aran
islands
that
he
had
the
experience
out
of
which
was
wrought
what
many
believe
to
be
his
greatest
play
the
scene
of
riders
to
the
sea
is
laid
in
a
cottage
on
inishmaan
the
middle
and
most
interesting
island
of
the
aran
group
while
synge
was
on
inishmaan
the
story
came
to
him
of
a
man
whose
body
had
been
washed
up
on
the
far
away
coast
of
donegal
and
who
by
reason
of
certain
peculiarities
of
dress
was
suspected
to
be
from
the
island
in
due
course
he
was
recognised
as
a
native
of
inishmaan
in
exactly
the
manner
described
in
the
play
and
perhaps
one
of
the
most
poignantly
vivid
passages
in
synge
book
on
the
aran
islands
relates
the
incident
of
his
burial
the
other
element
in
the
story
which
synge
introduces
into
the
play
is
equally
true
many
tales
of
second
sight
are
to
be
heard
among
celtic
races
in
fact
they
are
so
common
as
to
arouse
little
or
no
wonder
in
the
minds
of
the
people
it
is
just
such
a
tale
which
there
seems
no
valid
reason
for
doubting
that
synge
heard
and
that
gave
the
title
riders
to
the
sea
to
his
play
it
is
the
dramatist
high
distinction
that
he
has
simply
taken
the
materials
which
lay
ready
to
his
hand
and
by
the
power
of
sympathy
woven
them
with
little
modification
into
a
tragedy
which
for
dramatic
irony
and
noble
pity
has
no
equal
among
its
contemporaries
great
tragedy
it
is
frequently
claimed
with
some
show
of
justice
has
perforce
departed
with
the
advance
of
modern
life
and
its
complicated
tangle
of
interests
and
creature
comforts
a
highly
developed
civilisation
with
its
attendant
specialisation
of
culture
tends
ever
to
lose
sight
of
those
elemental
forces
those
primal
emotions
naked
to
wind
and
sky
which
are
the
stuff
from
which
great
drama
is
wrought
by
the
artist
but
which
as
it
would
seem
are
rapidly
departing
from
us
it
is
only
in
the
far
places
where
solitary
communion
may
be
had
with
the
elements
that
this
dynamic
life
is
still
to
be
found
continuously
and
it
is
accordingly
thither
that
the
dramatist
who
would
deal
with
spiritual
life
disengaged
from
the
environment
of
an
intellectual
maze
must
go
for
that
experience
which
will
beget
in
him
inspiration
for
his
art
the
aran
islands
from
which
synge
gained
his
inspiration
are
rapidly
losing
that
sense
of
isolation
and
which
has
hitherto
been
their
rare
distinction
and
which
furnished
the
motivation
for
synge
masterpiece
whether
or
not
synge
finds
a
successor
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
in
english
dramatic
literature
riders
to
the
sea
has
an
historic
value
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
in
its
accomplishment
and
its
possibilities
a
writer
in
the
manchester
guardian
shortly
after
synge
death
phrased
it
rightly
when
he
wrote
that
it
is
the
tragic
masterpiece
of
our
language
in
our
time
wherever
it
has
been
played
in
europe
from
galway
to
prague
it
has
made
the
word
tragedy
mean
something
more
profoundly
stirring
and
cleansing
to
the
spirit
than
it
did
the
secret
of
the
play
power
is
its
capacity
for
standing
afar
off
and
mingling
if
we
may
say
so
sympathy
with
relentlessness
there
is
a
wonderful
beauty
of
speech
in
the
words
of
every
character
wherein
the
latent
power
of
suggestion
is
almost
unlimited
in
the
big
world
the
old
people
do
be
leaving
things
after
them
for
their
sons
and
children
but
in
this
place
it
is
the
young
men
do
be
leaving
things
behind
for
them
that
do
be
old
in
the
quavering
rhythm
of
these
words
there
is
poignantly
present
that
quality
of
strangeness
and
remoteness
in
beauty
which
as
we
are
coming
to
realise
is
the
touchstone
of
celtic
literary
art
however
the
very
asceticism
of
the
play
has
begotten
a
corresponding
power
which
lifts
synge
work
far
out
of
the
current
of
the
irish
literary
revival
and
sets
it
high
in
a
timeless
atmosphere
of
universal
action
its
characters
live
and
die
it
is
their
virtue
in
life
to
be
lonely
and
none
but
the
lonely
man
in
tragedy
may
be
great
he
dies
and
then
it
is
the
virtue
in
life
of
the
women
mothers
and
wives
and
sisters
to
be
great
in
their
loneliness
great
as
maurya
the
stricken
mother
is
great
in
her
final
word
michael
has
a
clean
burial
in
the
far
north
by
the
grace
of
the
almighty
god
bartley
will
have
a
fine
coffin
out
of
the
white
boards
and
a
deep
grave
surely
what
more
can
we
want
than
that
no
man
at
all
can
be
living
for
ever
and
we
must
be
satisfied
the
pity
and
the
terror
of
it
all
have
brought
a
great
peace
the
peace
that
passeth
understanding
and
it
is
because
the
play
holds
this
timeless
peace
after
the
storm
which
has
bowed
down
every
character
that
riders
to
the
sea
may
rightly
take
its
place
as
the
greatest
modern
tragedy

the
english
tongue

sea
and
there

a
star
up
against
the
moon
and
it
rising
in
the
night
if
it
was
a
hundred
horses
or
a
thousand
horses

had
itself
what

old
woman
with
one
thing
and
she
saying
it
over
bartley
taking
the
halter
i
must
go
now

word
in
his
ear

black
cliffs
of
the
north
cathleen
trying
to
open
the
bundle
give
me
a
knife
nora
the
string
perished
with
the
salt
water
and
there
a
black
knot
on
it
you
would
loosen
in
a
week
nora
giving
her
a
knife
i
heard
tell
it
was
a
long
way
to
donegal
cathleen
cutting
the
string
it
is
surely
there
was
a
man
in
here
a
while
ago
the
man
sold
us
that
knife
and
he
said
if
you
set
off
walking
from
the
rocks
beyond
it
would
be
seven
days
you
be
in
donegal
nora
and
what
time
would
a
man
take
and
he
floating
cathleen
opens
the
bundle
and
takes
out
a
bit
of
a
stocking
they
look
at
them
eagerly
cathleen
in
a
low
voice
the
lord
spare
us
nora
is
it
a
queer
hard
thing
to
say
if
it
his
they
are
surely
nora
i
get
his
shirt
off
the
hook
the
way
we
can
put
the
one
flannel
on
the
other
she
looks
through
some
clothes
hanging
in
the
corner
it
not
with
them
cathleen
and
where
will
it
be
cathleen
i
thinking
bartley
put
it
on
him
in
the
morning
for
his
own
shirt
was
heavy
with
the
salt
in
it
pointing
to
the
corner
there
a
bit
of
a
sleeve
was
of
the
same
stuff
give
me
that
and
it
will
do
nora
brings
it
to
her
and
they
compare
the
flannel
cathleen
it
the
same
stuff
nora
but
if
it
is
itself
are
there
great
rolls
of
it
in
the
shops
of
galway
and
is
it
many
another
man
may
have
a
shirt
of
it
as
well
as
michael
himself
nora
who
has
taken
up
the
stocking
and
counted
the
stitches
crying
out
it
michael
cathleen
it
michael
god
spare
his
soul
and
what
will
herself
say
when
she
hears
this
story
and
bartley

taking
the
stocking
it
a
plain
stocking

second
one
of
the
third
pair
i
knitted
and
i
put
up
three
score
stitches
and
i
dropped
four
of
them
cathleen
counts
the
stitches
it
that
number
is
in
it
crying
out
ah
nora
is
it
a
bitter
thing
to
think
of
him
floating
that
way
to
the
far
north
and
no
one
to
keen
him
but
the
black
hags
that
do
be
flying
on
the
sea
nora
swinging
herself
round
and
throwing
out
her
arms
on
the
clothes
and
is
it
a
pitiful
thing
when
there
is
nothing
left
of
a
man
who
was
a
great
rower
and
fisher
but
a
bit
of
an
old

little
impatiently

pauses
again
with
her
hand
stretched
out
towards

opens
softly
and
old
women
begin
to
come
in
crossing
themselves
on
the
threshold
and
kneeling
down
in

of
the
stage
with
red

he
be
here
in
this
place
maurya
there
does
be
a
power
of
young
men

round
in
the
sea
and
what
way
would
they
know
if
it
was
michael
they
had
or
another
man
like
him
for
when
a
man
is
nine
days
in

a
thing
among

track
by

in
a
whisper
to
the
women
who
have
come
in

one
of
the
women

younger
women

in
and

table
then
men
carry
in
the
body
of
bartley
laid
on
a
plank
with
a
bit
of
a
sail
over
it
and
lay
it
on
the
table
cathleen
to
the
women
as
they
are
doing
so
what
way
was
he
drowned
one
of
the
women
the
gray
pony
knocked
him
into
the
sea
and
he
was
washed
out
where
there
is
a
great
surf
on
the
white
rocks
maurya
has
gone
over
and
knelt
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
women
are
keening
softly
and
swaying
themselves
with
a
slow
movement
cathleen
and
nora
kneel
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
men
kneel
near
the
door
maurya
raising
her
head
and
speaking
as
if
she
did
not
see
the
people
around
her
they
all
gone
now
and
there
is
anything
more
the
sea
can
do
to
me
i
have
no
call
now
to
be
up
crying
and
praying
when
the
wind
breaks
from
the
south
and
you
can
hear
the
surf
is
in
the
east
and
the
surf
is
in
the
west
making
a
great
stir
with
the
two
noises
and
they
hitting
one
on
the
other
i
have
no
call
now
to
be
going
down
and
getting
holy
water
in
the
dark
nights
after
samhain
and
i
wo
care
what
way
the
sea
is
when
the
other
women
will
be
keening
to
nora
give
me
the
holy
water
nora
there
a
small
sup
still
on
the
dresser
nora
gives
it
to
her
maurya
drops
michael
clothes
across
bartley
feet
and
sprinkles
the
holy
water
over
him
it
is
that
i
have
prayed
for
you
bartley
to
the
almighty
god
it
is
that
i
have
said
prayers
in
the
dark
night
till
you
know
what
be
saying
but
it
a
great
rest
i
have
now
and
time
surely
it
a
great
rest
i
have
now
and
great
sleeping
in
the
long
nights
after
samhain
if
it
only
a
bit
of
wet
flour
we
do
have
to
eat
and
maybe
a
fish
that
would
be
stinking
she
kneels
down
again
crossing
herself
and
saying
prayers
under
her
breath
cathleen
to
an
old
man
maybe
yourself
and
eamon
would
make
a
coffin
when
the
sun
rises
we
have
fine
white
boards
herself
bought
god
help
her
thinking
michael
would
be
found
and
i
have
a
new
cake
you
can
eat
while
you
be
working
the
old
man
looking
at
the
boards
are
there
nails
with
them
cathleen
there
are
not
colum
we
did
think
of
the
nails
another
man
it
a
great
wonder
she
would
think
of
the
nails
and
all
the
coffins
she
seen
made
already
cathleen
it
getting
old
she
is
and
broken
maurya
stands
up
again
very
slowly
and
spreads
out
the
pieces
of
michael
clothes
beside
the
body
sprinkling
them
with
the
last
of
the
holy
water
nora
in
a
whisper
to
cathleen
she
quiet
now
and
easy
but
the
day
michael
was
drowned
you
could
hear
her
crying
out
from
this
to
the
spring
well
it
fonder
she
was
of
michael
and
would
any
one
have
thought
that
cathleen
slowly
and
clearly
an
old
woman
will
be
soon
tired
with
anything
she
will
do
and
is
it
nine
days
herself
is
after
crying
and
keening
and
making
great
sorrow
in
the
house
maurya
puts
the
empty
cup
mouth
downwards
on
the
table
and
lays
her
hands
together
on
bartley
feet
they
all
together
this
time
and
the
end
is
come
may
the
almighty
god
have
mercy
on
bartley
soul
and
on
michael
soul
and
on
the
souls
of
sheamus
and
patch
and
stephen
and
shawn
bending
her
head
and
may
he
have
mercy
on
my
soul
nora
and
on
the
soul
of
every
one
is
left
living
in
the
world
she
pauses
and
the
keen
rises
a
little
more
loudly
from
the
women
then
sinks
away
maurya
continuing
michael
has
a
clean
burial
in
the
far
north
by
the
grace
of
the
almighty
god
bartley
will
have
a
fine
coffin
out
of
the
white
boards
and
a
deep
grave
surely
what
more
can
we
want
than
that
no
man
at
all
can
be
living
for
ever
and
we
must
be
satisfied
she
kneels
down
again
and
the
curtain
falls
slowly
