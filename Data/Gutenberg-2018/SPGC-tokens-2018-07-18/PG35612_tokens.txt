preface
the
present
volume
is
composed
with
a
few
additions
of
six
lectures
read
at
columbia
university
in
february
and
repeated
in
april
of
the
same
year
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
these
lectures
in
turn
were
based
on
a
regular
course
which
i
had
been
giving
for
some
time
at
harvard
college
though
produced
under
such
learned
auspices
my
book
can
make
no
great
claims
to
learning
it
contains
the
impressions
of
an
amateur
the
appreciations
of
an
ordinary
reader
concerning
three
great
writers
two
of
whom
at
least
might
furnish
matter
enough
for
the
studies
of
a
lifetime
and
actually
have
academies
libraries
and
university
chairs
especially
consecrated
to
their
memory
i
am
no
specialist
in
the
study
of
lucretius
i
am
not
a
dante
scholar
nor
a
goethe
scholar
i
can
report
no
facts
and
propose
no
hypotheses
about
these
men
which
are
not
at
hand
in
their
familiar
works
or
in
commentaries
upon
them
my
excuse
for
writing
about
them
notwithstanding
is
merely
the
human
excuse
which
every
new
poet
has
for
writing
about
the
spring
they
have
attracted
me
they
have
moved
me
to
reflection
they
have
revealed
to
me
certain
aspects
of
nature
and
of
philosophy
which
i
am
prompted
by
mere
sincerity
to
express
if
anybody
seems
interested
or
willing
to
listen
what
i
can
offer
the
benevolent
reader
therefore
is
no
learned
investigation
it
is
only
a
piece
of
literary
criticism
together
with
a
first
broad
lesson
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
perhaps
in
philosophy
itself

introduction
the
sole
advantage
in
possessing
great
works
of
literature
lies
in
what
they
can
help
us
to
become
in
themselves
as
feats
performed
by
their
authors
they
would
have
forfeited
none
of
their
truth
or
greatness
if
they
had
perished
before
our
day
we
can
neither
take
away
nor
add
to
their
past
value
or
inherent
dignity
it
is
only
they
in
so
far
as
they
are
appropriate
food
and
not
poison
for
us
that
can
add
to
the
present
value
and
dignity
of
our
minds
foreign
classics
have
to
be
retranslated
and
reinterpreted
for
each
generation
to
render
their
old
naturalness
in
a
natural
way
and
keep
their
perennial
humanity
living
and
capable
of
assimilation
even
native
classics
have
to
be
reapprehended
by
every
reader
it
is
this
continual
digestion
of
the
substance
supplied
by
the
past
that
alone
renders
the
insights
of
the
past
still
potent
in
the
present
and
for
the
future
living
criticism
genuine
appreciation
is
the
interest
we
draw
from
year
to
year
on
the
unrecoverable
capital
of
human
genius
regarded
from
this
point
of
view
as
substances
to
be
digested
the
poetic
remains
of
lucretius
dante
and
goethe
though
it
is
his
only
that
i
shall
speak
of
afford
rather
a
varied
feast
in
their
doctrine
and
genius
they
may
seem
to
be
too
much
opposed
to
be
at
all
convergent
or
combinable
in
their
wisdom
some
who
know
and
care
for
one
perhaps
of
these
poets
may
be
disposed
to
doubt
whether
they
have
anything
vital
to
learn
from
the
other
two
yet
it
is
as
a
pupil
i
hope
a
discriminating
pupil
of
each
in
turn
that
i
mean
to
speak
and
i
venture
to
maintain
that
in
what
makes
them
great
they
are
compatible
that
without
any
vagueness
or
doubleness
in
one
criterion
of
taste
one
may
admire
enthusiastically
the
poetry
of
each
in
turn
and
that
one
may
accept
the
essential
philosophy
the
positive
intuition
of
each
without
lack
of
definition
or
system
in
one
own
thinking
indeed
the
diversity
of
these
three
poets
passes
if
i
may
use
the
hegelian
dialect
into
a
unity
of
a
higher
kind
each
is
typical
of
an
age
taken
together
they
sum
up
all
european
philosophy
lucretius
adopts
the
most
radical
and
the
most
correct
of
those
cosmological
systems
which
the
genius
of
early
greece
had
devised
he
sees
the
world
to
be
one
great
edifice
one
great
machine
all
its
parts
reacting
upon
one
another
and
growing
out
of
one
another
in
obedience
to
a
general
pervasive
process
or
life
his
poem
describes
the
nature
that
is
the
birth
and
composition
of
all
things
it
shows
how
they
are
compounded
out
of
elements
and
how
these
elements
which
he
thinks
are
atoms
in
perpetual
motion
are
being
constantly
redistributed
so
that
old
things
perish
and
new
things
arise
into
this
view
of
the
world
he
fits
a
view
of
human
life
as
it
ought
to
be
led
under
such
conditions
his
materialism
is
completed
by
an
aspiration
towards
freedom
and
quietness
of
spirit
allowed
to
look
once
upon
the
wonderful
spectacle
which
is
to
repeat
itself
in
the
world
for
ever
we
should
look
and
admire
for
we
die
we
should
eat
drink
and
be
merry
but
moderately
and
with
much
art
lest
we
die
miserably
and
die
this
is
one
complete
system
of
philosophy
materialism
in
natural
science
humanism
in
ethics
such
was
the
gist
of
all
greek
philosophy
before
socrates
of
that
philosophy
which
was
truly
hellenic
and
corresponded
with
the
movement
which
produced
greek
manners
greek
government
and
greek
art
a
movement
towards
simplicity
autonomy
and
reasonableness
in
everything
from
dress
to
religion
such
is
the
gist
also
of
what
may
be
called
the
philosophy
of
the
renaissance
the
reassertion
of
science
and
liberty
in
the
modern
world
by
bacon
by
spinoza
by
the
whole
contemporary
school
that
looks
to
science
for
its
view
of
the
facts
and
to
the
happiness
of
men
on
earth
for
its
ideal
this
system
is
called
naturalism
and
of
this
lucretius
is
the
unrivalled
poet
skip
a
thousand
years
and
more
and
a
contrasting
spectacle
is
before
us
all
minds
all
institutions
are
dominated
by
a
religion
that
represents
the
soul
as
a
pilgrim
upon
earth
the
world
is
fallen
and
subject
to
the
devil
pain
and
poverty
are
considered
normal
happiness
impossible
here
and
to
be
hoped
for
only
in
a
future
life
provided
the
snares
and
pleasures
of
the
present
life
have
not
entrapped
us
meantime
a
sort
of
jacob
ladder
stretches
from
the
stone
on
which
the
wayfarer
lays
his
head
into
the
heaven
he
hopes
for
and
the
angels
he
sees
ascending
and
descending
upon
it
are
beautiful
stories
wonderful
theories
and
comforting
rites
through
these
he
partakes
even
on
earth
of
what
will
be
his
heavenly
existence
he
partly
understands
his
destiny
his
own
history
and
that
of
the
world
are
transfigured
before
him
and
without
ceasing
to
be
sad
become
beautiful
the
raptures
of
a
perfect
conformity
with
the
will
of
god
and
of
union
with
him
overtake
him
in
his
prayers
this
is
supernaturalism
a
system
represented
in
christendom
chiefly
by
the
catholic
church
but
adopted
also
by
the
later
pagans
and
widespread
in
asia
from
remote
antiquity
down
to
the
present
time
little
as
the
momentary
temper
of
europe
and
america
may
now
incline
to
such
a
view
it
is
always
possible
for
the
individual
or
for
the
race
to
return
to
it
its
sources
are
in
the
solitude
of
the
spirit
and
in
the
disparity
or
the
opposition
between
what
the
spirit
feels
it
is
fitted
to
do
and
what
in
this
world
it
is
condemned
to
waste
itself
upon
the
unmatched
poet
of
this
supernaturalism
is
dante
skip
again
some
five
hundred
years
and
there
is
another
change
of
scene
the
teutonic
races
that
had
previously
conquered
europe
have
begun
to
dominate
and
understand
themselves
they
have
become
protestants
or
protesters
against
the
roman
world
an
infinite
fountain
of
life
seems
to
be
unlocked
within
their
bosom
they
turn
successively
to
the
bible
to
learning
to
patriotism
to
industry
for
new
objects
to
love
and
fresh
worlds
to
conquer
but
they
have
too
much
vitality
or
too
little
maturity
to
rest
in
any
of
these
things
a
demon
drives
them
on
and
this
demon
divine
and
immortal
in
its
apparent
waywardness
is
their
inmost
self
it
is
their
insatiable
will
their
radical
courage
nay
though
this
be
a
hard
saying
to
the
uninitiated
their
will
is
the
creator
of
all
those
objects
by
which
it
is
sometimes
amused
and
sometimes
baffled
but
never
tamed
their
will
summons
all
opportunities
and
dangers
out
of
nothing
to
feed
its
appetite
for
action
and
in
that
ideal
function
lies
their
sole
reality
once
attained
things
are
transcended
like
the
episodes
of
a
spent
dream
they
are
to
be
smiled
at
and
forgotten
the
spirit
that
feigned
and
discarded
them
remains
always
strong
and
undefiled
it
aches
for
new
conquests
over
new
fictions
this
is
romanticism
it
is
an
attitude
often
found
in
english
poetry
and
characteristic
of
german
philosophy
it
was
adopted
by
emerson
and
ought
to
be
sympathetic
to
americans
for
it
expresses
the
of
youth
and
mystical
faith
in
will
and
action
the
greatest
monument
to
this
romanticism
is
goethe
can
it
be
an
accident
that
the
most
adequate
and
probably
the
most
lasting
exposition
of
these
three
schools
of
philosophy
should
have
been
made
by
poets
are
poets
at
heart
in
search
of
a
philosophy
or
is
philosophy
in
the
end
nothing
but
poetry
let
us
consider
the
situation
if
we
think
of
philosophy
as
an
investigation
into
truth
or
as
reasoning
upon
truths
supposed
to
be
discovered
there
is
nothing
in
philosophy
akin
to
poetry
there
is
nothing
poetic
about
the
works
of
epicurus
or
thomas
aquinas
or
kant
they
are
leafless
forests
in
lucretius
and
in
dante
themselves
we
find
passages
where
nothing
is
poetical
except
the
metre
or
some
incidental
ornament
in
such
passages
the
form
of
poetry
is
thrown
over
the
substance
of
prose
as
lucretius
himself
confesses
where
he
says
as
when
physicians
would
contrive
to
administer
loathsome
wormwood
to
little
boys
they
first
moisten
the
rim
of
the
cup
round
about
with
sweet
and
golden
honey
that
the
children
unsuspecting
youth
may
be
beguiled
to
the
lips
but
no
further
while
they
drink
down
the
bitter
potion
by
deception
not
betrayed
but
rather
by
that
stratagem
made
whole
and
restored
so
i
have
willed
to
set
forth
our
doctrine
before
thee
in
pierian
song
and
to
smear
it
as
it
were
with
the
muses
honey
but
poetry
can
not
be
spread
upon
things
like
butter
it
must
play
upon
them
like
light
and
be
the
medium
through
which
we
see
them
lucretius
does
himself
an
injustice
if
his
philosophy
had
been
wormwood
to
him
he
could
not
have
said
as
he
does
just
before
this
passage
like
a
sharp
blow
of
the
thyrsus
a
great
hope
of
praise
vibrates
through
my
heart
and
fills
my
breast
with
tender
love
of
the
muses
whereby
now
instinct
with
flowering
fancy
i
traverse
pathless
haunts
of
the
pierides
by
no
man
foot
trodden
before
it
is
joy
to
reach
undefiled
fountains
and
quaff
it
is
joy
to
gather
fresh
flowers
and
weave
a
matchless
crown
for
my
head
of
those
bays
with
which
never
yet
the
muses
veiled
the
brow
of
any
man
first
in
that
i
teach
sublime
truths
and
come
to
free
the
soul
from
the
strangling
knots
of
superstition
then
in
that
on
so
dark
a
theme
i
pour
forth
so
clear
a
song
suffusing
all
with
poetic
beauty
if
haply
by
such
means
i
might
keep
thy
mind
intent
upon
my
verses
until
thine
eye
fathoms
the
whole
structure
of
nature
and
the
fixed
form
that
makes
it
beautiful
here
i
think
we
have
the
solution
to
our
doubt
the
reasonings
and
investigations
of
philosophy
are
arduous
and
if
poetry
is
to
be
linked
with
them
it
can
be
artificially
only
and
with
a
bad
grace
but
the
vision
of
philosophy
is
sublime
the
order
it
reveals
in
the
world
is
something
beautiful
tragic
sympathetic
to
the
mind
and
just
what
every
poet
on
a
small
or
on
a
large
scale
is
always
trying
to
catch
in
philosophy
itself
investigation
and
reasoning
are
only
preparatory
and
servile
parts
means
to
an
end
they
terminate
in
insight
or
what
in
the
noblest
sense
of
the
word
may
be
called
a
steady
contemplation
of
all
things
in
their
order
and
worth
such
contemplation
is
imaginative
no
one
can
reach
it
who
has
not
enlarged
his
mind
and
tamed
his
heart
a
philosopher
who
attains
it
is
for
the
moment
a
poet
and
a
poet
who
turns
his
practised
and
passionate
imagination
on
the
order
of
all
things
or
on
anything
in
the
light
of
the
whole
is
for
that
moment
a
philosopher
nevertheless
even
if
we
grant
that
the
philosopher
in
his
best
moments
is
a
poet
we
may
suspect
that
the
poet
has
his
worst
moments
when
he
tries
to
be
a
philosopher
or
rather
when
he
succeeds
in
being
one
philosophy
is
something
reasoned
and
heavy
poetry
something
winged
flashing
inspired
take
almost
any
longish
poem
and
the
parts
of
it
are
better
than
the
whole
a
poet
is
able
to
put
together
a
few
words
a
cadence
or
two
a
single
interesting
image
he
renders
in
that
way
some
moment
of
comparatively
high
tension
of
comparatively
keen
sentiment
but
at
the
next
moment
the
tension
is
relaxed
the
sentiment
has
faded
and
what
succeeds
is
usually
incongruous
with
what
went
before
or
at
least
inferior
the
thought
drifts
away
from
what
it
had
started
to
be
it
is
lost
in
the
sands
of
versification
as
man
is
now
constituted
to
be
brief
is
almost
a
condition
of
being
inspired
shall
we
say
then
and
i
now
broach
an
idea
by
which
i
set
some
store
that
poetry
is
essentially
that
what
is
poetic
is
necessarily
intermittent
in
the
writings
of
poets
that
only
the
fleeting
moment
the
mood
the
episode
can
be
rapturously
felt
or
rapturously
rendered
while
life
as
a
whole
history
character
and
destiny
are
objects
unfit
for
imagination
to
dwell
on
and
repellent
to
poetic
art
i
can
not
think
so
if
it
be
a
fact
as
it
often
is
that
we
find
little
things
pleasing
and
great
things
arid
and
formless
and
if
we
are
better
poets
in
a
line
than
in
an
epic
that
is
simply
due
to
lack
of
faculty
on
our
part
lack
of
imagination
and
memory
and
above
all
to
lack
of
discipline
this
might
be
shown
i
think
by
psychological
analysis
if
we
cared
to
rely
on
something
so
abstract
and
so
debatable
for
in
what
does
the
poet
himself
excel
the
common
unimaginative
person
who
talks
or
who
stares
is
it
that
he
thinks
even
less
rather
i
suppose
in
that
he
feels
more
in
that
his
moment
of
intuition
though
fleeting
has
a
vision
a
scope
a
symbolic
something
about
it
that
renders
it
deep
and
expressive
intensity
even
momentary
intensity
if
it
can
be
expressed
at
all
comports
fullness
and
suggestion
compressed
into
that
intense
moment
yes
everything
that
comes
to
us
at
all
must
come
to
us
at
some
time
or
other
it
is
always
the
fleeting
moment
in
which
we
live
to
this
fleeting
moment
the
philosopher
as
well
as
the
poet
is
actually
confined
each
must
enrich
it
with
his
endless
vistas
vistas
necessarily
focused
if
they
are
to
be
disclosed
at
all
in
the
eye
of
the
observer
here
and
now
what
makes
the
difference
between
a
moment
of
poetic
insight
and
a
vulgar
moment
is
that
the
passions
of
the
poetic
moment
have
more
perspective
even
the
poet
selects
his
words
so
that
they
have
a
magic
momentum
in
them
which
carries
us
we
know
not
how
to
of
intuition
is
not
the
poetic
quality
of
phrases
and
images
due
to
their
concentrating
and
liberating
the
confused
promptings
left
in
us
by
a
long
experience
when
we
feel
the
poetic
thrill
is
it
not
that
we
find
sweep
in
the
concise
and
depth
in
the
clear
as
we
might
find
all
the
lights
of
the
sea
in
the
water
of
a
jewel
and
what
is
a
philosophic
thought
but
such
an
epitome
if
a
short
passage
is
poetical
because
it
is
pregnant
with
suggestion
of
a
few
things
which
stretches
our
attention
and
makes
us
rapt
and
serious
how
much
more
poetical
ought
a
vision
to
be
which
was
pregnant
with
all
we
care
for
focus
a
little
experience
give
some
scope
and
depth
to
your
feeling
and
it
grows
imaginative
give
it
more
scope
and
more
depth
focus
all
experience
within
it
make
it
a
vision
of
the
world
and
it
will
grow
imaginative
in
a
superlative
degree
and
be
supremely
poetical
the
difficulty
after
having
the
experience
to
symbolize
lies
only
in
having
enough
imagination
to
hold
and
suspend
it
in
a
thought
and
further
to
give
this
thought
such
verbal
expression
that
others
maybe
able
to
decipher
it
and
to
be
stirred
by
it
as
by
a
wind
of
suggestion
sweeping
the
whole
forest
of
their
memories
poetry
then
is
not
poetical
for
being
or
incidental
but
on
the
contrary
for
being
comprehensive
and
having
range
if
too
much
matter
renders
it
heavy
that
is
the
fault
of
the
poet
weak
intellect
not
of
the
outstretched
world
a
quicker
eye
a
more
synthetic
imagination
might
grasp
a
larger
subject
with
the
same
ease
the
picture
that
would
render
this
larger
subject
would
not
be
flatter
and
feebler
for
its
extent
but
on
the
contrary
deeper
and
stronger
since
it
would
possess
as
much
unity
as
the
little
one
with
greater
volume
as
in
a
supreme
dramatic
crisis
all
our
life
seems
to
be
focused
in
the
present
and
used
in
colouring
our
consciousness
and
shaping
our
decisions
so
for
each
philosophic
poet
the
whole
world
of
man
is
gathered
together
and
he
is
never
so
much
a
poet
as
when
in
a
single
cry
he
summons
all
that
has
affinity
to
him
in
the
universe
and
salutes
his
ultimate
destiny
it
is
the
acme
of
life
to
understand
life
the
height
of
poetry
is
to
speak
the
language
of
the
gods
but
enough
of
psychological
analysis
and
of
reasoning
in
the
void
three
historical
illustrations
will
prove
my
point
more
clearly
and
more
conclusively

lucretius
there
is
perhaps
no
important
poem
the
antecedents
of
which
can
be
traced
so
exhaustively
as
can
those
of
the
work
of
lucretius
rerum
these
antecedents
however
do
not
lie
in
the
poet
himself
if
they
did
we
should
not
be
able
to
trace
them
since
we
know
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
about
lucretius
the
man
in
a
chronicon
compiled
by
jerome
largely
out
of
suetonius
in
which
miscellaneous
events
are
noted
which
occurred
in
each
successive
year
we
read
for
the
year
titus
lucretius
poet
is
born
after
a
had
turned
him
mad
and
he
had
written
in
the
intervals
of
his
insanity
several
books
which
cicero
revised
he
killed
himself
by
his
own
hand
in
the
year
of
his
age
the
in
this
report
sounds
apocryphal
and
the
story
of
the
madness
and
suicide
attributes
too
edifying
an
end
to
an
atheist
and
epicurean
not
to
be
suspected
if
anything
lends
colour
to
the
story
it
is
a
certain
consonance
which
we
may
feel
between
its
tragic
incidents
and
the
genius
of
the
poet
as
revealed
in
his
work
where
we
find
a
strange
scorn
of
love
a
strange
vehemence
and
a
high
melancholy
it
is
by
no
means
incredible
that
the
author
of
such
a
poem
should
have
been
at
some
time
the
slave
of
a
pathological
passion
that
his
vehemence
and
inspiration
should
have
passed
into
mania
and
that
he
should
have
taken
his
own
life
but
the
untrustworthy
authority
of
jerome
can
not
assure
us
whether
what
he
repeats
is
a
tradition
founded
on
fact
or
an
ingenious
fiction
our
ignorance
of
the
life
of
lucretius
is
not
i
think
much
to
be
regretted
his
work
preserves
that
part
of
him
which
he
himself
would
have
wished
to
preserve
perfect
conviction
ignores
itself
proclaiming
the
public
truth
to
reach
this
no
doubt
requires
a
peculiar
genius
which
is
called
intelligence
for
intelligence
is
quickness
in
seeing
things
as
they
are
but
where
intelligence
is
attained
the
rest
of
a
man
like
the
scaffolding
to
a
finished
building
becomes
irrelevant
we
do
not
wish
it
to
intercept
our
view
of
the
solid
structure
which
alone
was
intended
by
the
artist
if
he
was
building
for
others
and
was
not
a
coxcomb
it
is
his
intellectual
vision
that
the
naturalist
in
particular
wishes
to
hand
down
to
posterity
not
the
shabby
incidents
that
preceded
that
vision
in
his
own
person
these
incidents
even
if
they
were
by
chance
interesting
could
not
be
repeated
in
us
but
the
vision
into
which
the
thinker
poured
his
faculties
and
to
which
he
devoted
his
vigils
is
communicable
to
us
also
and
may
become
a
part
of
ourselves
since
lucretius
is
thus
identical
for
us
with
his
poem
and
is
lost
in
his
philosophy
the
antecedents
of
lucretius
are
simply
the
stages
by
which
his
conception
of
nature
first
shaped
itself
in
the
human
mind
to
retrace
these
stages
is
easy
some
of
them
are
only
too
familiar
yet
the
very
triteness
of
the
subject
may
blind
us
to
the
grandeur
and
audacity
of
the
intellectual
feat
involved
a
naturalistic
conception
of
things
is
a
great
work
of
imagination
greater
i
think
than
any
dramatic
or
moral
mythology
it
is
a
conception
fit
to
inspire
great
poetry
and
in
the
end
perhaps
it
will
prove
the
only
conception
able
to
inspire
it
we
are
told
of
the
old
xenophanes
that
he
looked
up
into
the
round
heaven
and
cried
the
all
is
one
what
is
logically
a
truism
may
often
be
imaginatively
a
great
discovery
because
no
one
before
may
have
thought
of
the
obvious
analogy
which
the
truism
registers
so
in
this
case
the
unity
of
all
things
is
logically
an
evident
if
barren
truth
for
the
most
disparate
and
unrelated
worlds
would
still
be
a
multitude
and
so
an
aggregate
and
so
in
some
sense
a
unity
yet
it
was
a
great
imaginative
feat
to
cast
the
eye
deliberately
round
the
entire
horizon
and
to
draw
mentally
the
sum
of
all
reality
discovering
that
reality
makes
such
a
sum
and
may
be
called
one
as
any
stone
or
animal
though
composed
of
many
parts
is
yet
called
one
in
common
parlance
it
was
doubtless
some
prehistoric
man
of
genius
long
before
xenophanes
who
first
applied
in
this
way
to
all
things
together
that
notion
of
unity
and
wholeness
which
everybody
had
gained
by
observation
of
things
singly
and
who
first
ventured
to
speak
of
the
world
to
do
so
is
to
set
the
problem
for
all
natural
philosophy
and
in
a
certain
measure
to
anticipate
the
solution
of
that
problem
for
it
is
to
ask
how
things
hang
together
and
to
assume
that
they
do
hang
together
in
one
way
or
another
to
cry
the
all
is
one
and
to
perceive
that
all
things
are
in
one
landscape
and
form
a
system
by
their
juxtaposition
is
the
rude
beginning
of
wisdom
in
natural
philosophy
but
it
is
easy
to
go
farther
and
to
see
that
things
form
a
unity
in
a
far
deeper
and
more
mysterious
way
one
of
the
first
things
for
instance
that
impresses
the
poet
the
man
of
feeling
and
reflection
is
that
these
objects
that
people
the
world
all
pass
away
and
that
the
place
knows
them
no
more
yet
when
they
vanish
nothingness
does
not
succeed
other
things
arise
in
their
stead
nature
remains
always
young
and
whole
in
spite
of
death
at
work
everywhere
and
what
takes
the
place
of
what
continually
disappears
is
often
remarkably
like
it
in
character
universal
instability
is
not
incompatible
with
a
great
monotony
in
things
so
that
while
heraclitus
lamented
that
everything
was
in
flux
ecclesiastes
who
was
also
entirely
convinced
of
that
truth
could
lament
that
there
was
nothing
new
under
the
sun
this
double
experience
of
mutation
and
recurrence
an
experience
at
once
sentimental
and
scientific
soon
brought
with
it
a
very
great
thought
perhaps
the
greatest
thought
that
mankind
has
ever
hit
upon
and
which
was
the
chief
inspiration
of
lucretius
it
is
that
all
we
observe
about
us
and
ourselves
also
may
be
so
many
passing
forms
of
a
permanent
substance
this
substance
while
remaining
the
same
in
quantity
and
in
inward
quality
is
constantly
redistributed
in
its
redistribution
it
forms
those
aggregates
which
we
call
things
and
which
we
find
constantly
disappearing
and
reappearing
all
things
are
dust
and
to
dust
they
return
a
dust
however
eternally
fertile
and
destined
to
fall
perpetually
into
new
and
doubtless
beautiful
forms
this
notion
of
substance
lends
a
much
greater
unity
to
the
outspread
world
it
persuades
us
that
all
things
pass
into
one
another
and
have
a
common
ground
from
which
they
spring
successively
and
to
which
they
return
the
spectacle
of
inexorable
change
the
triumph
of
time
or
whatever
we
may
call
it
has
always
been
a
favourite
theme
for
lyric
and
tragic
poetry
and
for
religious
meditation
to
perceive
universal
mutation
to
feel
the
vanity
of
life
has
always
been
the
beginning
of
seriousness
it
is
the
condition
for
any
beautiful
measured
or
tender
philosophy
prior
to
that
everything
is
barbarous
both
in
morals
and
in
poetry
for
until
then
mankind
has
not
learned
to
renounce
anything
has
not
outgrown
the
instinctive
egotism
and
optimism
of
the
young
animal
and
has
not
removed
the
centre
of
its
being
or
of
its
faith
from
the
will
to
the
imagination
to
discover
substance
then
is
a
great
step
in
the
life
of
reason
even
if
substance
be
conceived
quite
negatively
as
a
term
that
serves
merely
to
mark
by
contrast
the
unsubstantiality
the
vanity
of
all
particular
moments
and
things
that
is
the
way
in
which
indian
poetry
and
philosophy
conceived
substance
but
the
step
taken
by
greek
physics
and
by
the
poetry
of
lucretius
passes
beyond
lucretius
and
the
greeks
in
observing
universal
mutation
and
the
vanity
of
life
conceived
behind
appearance
a
great
intelligible
process
an
evolution
in
nature
the
reality
became
interesting
as
well
as
the
illusion
physics
became
scientific
which
had
previously
been
merely
spectacular
here
was
a
much
richer
theme
for
the
poet
and
philosopher
who
was
launched
upon
the
discovery
of
the
ground
and
secret
causes
of
this
gay
or
melancholy
flux
the
understanding
that
enabled
him
to
discover
these
causes
did
for
the
european
what
no
indian
mystic
what
no
despiser
of
understanding
anywhere
suffers
himself
to
do
namely
to
dominate
foretell
and
transform
this
changing
show
with
a
virile
practical
intelligence
the
man
who
discovers
the
secret
springs
of
appearances
opens
to
contemplation
a
second
positive
world
the
workshop
and
busy
depths
of
nature
where
a
prodigious
mechanism
is
continually
supporting
our
life
and
making
ready
for
it
from
afar
by
the
most
exquisite
adjustments
the
march
of
this
mechanism
while
it
produces
life
and
often
fosters
it
yet
as
often
makes
it
difficult
and
condemns
it
to
extinction
this
truth
which
the
conception
of
natural
substance
first
makes
intelligible
justifies
the
elegies
which
the
poets
of
illusion
and
disillusion
have
always
written
upon
human
things
it
is
a
truth
with
a
melancholy
side
but
being
a
truth
it
satisfies
and
exalts
the
rational
mind
that
craves
truth
as
truth
whether
it
be
sad
or
comforting
and
wishes
to
pursue
a
possible
not
an
impossible
happiness
so
far
greek
science
had
made
out
that
the
world
was
one
that
there
was
a
substance
that
this
was
a
physical
substance
distributed
and
moving
in
space
it
was
matter
the
question
remained
what
is
the
precise
nature
of
matter
and
how
does
it
produce
the
appearances
we
observe
the
only
answer
that
concerns
us
here
is
that
given
by
lucretius
an
answer
he
accepted
from
epicurus
his
master
in
everything
who
in
turn
had
accepted
it
from
democritus
now
democritus
had
made
a
notable
advance
over
the
systems
that
selected
one
obvious
substance
like
water
or
collected
all
the
obvious
substances
as
anaxagoras
had
done
and
tried
to
make
the
world
out
of
them
democritus
thought
that
the
substance
of
everything
ought
not
to
have
any
of
the
qualities
present
in
some
things
and
absent
in
others
it
ought
to
have
only
the
qualities
present
in
all
things
it
should
be
matter
materiality
according
to
him
consisted
of
extension
figure
and
solidity
in
the
thinnest
ether
if
we
looked
sharp
enough
we
should
find
nothing
but
particles
possessing
these
properties
all
other
qualities
of
things
were
apparent
only
and
imputed
to
them
by
a
convention
of
the
mind
the
mind
was
a
born
mythologist
and
projected
its
feelings
into
their
causes
light
colour
taste
warmth
beauty
excellence
were
such
imputed
and
conventional
qualities
only
space
and
matter
were
real
but
empty
space
was
no
less
real
than
matter
consequently
although
the
atoms
of
matter
never
changed
their
form
real
changes
could
take
place
in
nature
because
their
position
might
change
in
a
real
space
unlike
the
useless
substance
of
the
indians
the
substance
of
democritus
could
offer
a
calculable
ground
for
the
flux
of
appearances
for
this
substance
was
distributed
unequally
in
the
void
and
was
constantly
moving
every
appearance
however
fleeting
corresponded
to
a
precise
configuration
of
substance
it
arose
with
that
configuration
and
perished
with
it
this
substance
accordingly
was
physical
not
metaphysical
it
was
no
dialectical
term
but
a
scientific
anticipation
a
prophecy
as
to
what
an
observer
who
should
be
properly
equipped
would
discover
in
the
interior
of
bodies
materialism
is
not
a
system
of
metaphysics
it
is
a
speculation
in
chemistry
and
physiology
to
the
effect
that
if
analysis
could
go
deep
enough
it
would
find
that
all
substance
was
homogeneous
and
that
all
motion
was
regular
though
matter
was
homogeneous
the
forms
of
the
ultimate
particles
according
to
democritus
were
various
and
sundry
combinations
of
them
constituted
the
sundry
objects
in
nature
motion
was
not
as
the
vulgar
and
aristotle
supposed
unnatural
and
produced
magically
by
some
moral
cause
it
had
been
eternal
and
was
native
to
the
atoms
on
striking
they
rebounded
and
the
mechanical
currents
or
vortices
which
these
contacts
occasioned
formed
a
multitude
of
stellar
systems
called
worlds
with
which
infinite
space
was
studded
mechanism
as
to
motion
atomism
as
to
structure
materialism
as
to
substance
that
is
the
whole
system
of
democritus
it
is
as
wonderful
in
its
insight
in
its
sense
for
the
ideal
demands
of
method
and
understanding
as
it
is
strange
and
audacious
in
its
simplicity
only
the
most
convinced
rationalist
the
boldest
prophet
could
embrace
it
dogmatically
yet
time
has
largely
given
it
the
proof
if
democritus
could
look
down
upon
the
present
state
of
science
he
would
laugh
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
partly
at
the
confirmation
we
can
furnish
to
portions
of
his
philosophy
and
partly
at
our
stupidity
that
can
not
guess
the
rest
there
are
two
maxims
in
lucretius
that
suffice
even
to
this
day
to
distinguish
a
thinker
who
is
a
naturalist
from
one
who
is
not
nothing
he
says
arises
in
the
body
in
order
that
we
may
use
it
but
what
arises
brings
forth
its
use
this
is
that
discarding
of
final
causes
on
which
all
progress
in
science
depends
the
other
maxim
runs
one
thing
will
grow
plain
when
compared
with
another
and
blind
night
shall
not
obliterate
the
path
for
thee
before
thou
hast
thoroughly
scanned
the
ultimate
things
of
nature
so
much
will
things
throw
light
on
things
nature
is
her
own
standard
and
if
she
seems
to
us
unnatural
there
is
no
hope
for
our
minds
the
ethics
of
democritus
in
so
far
as
we
may
judge
from
scanty
evidence
were
merely
descriptive
or
satirical
he
was
an
aristocratic
observer
a
scorner
of
fools
nature
was
laughing
at
us
all
the
wise
man
considered
his
fate
and
by
knowing
it
raised
himself
in
a
measure
above
it
all
living
things
pursued
the
greatest
happiness
they
could
see
their
way
to
but
they
were
marvellously
and
the
business
of
the
philosopher
was
to
foresee
and
pursue
the
greatest
happiness
that
was
really
possible
this
in
so
rough
a
world
was
to
be
found
chiefly
in
abstention
and
retrenchment
if
you
asked
for
little
it
was
more
probable
that
the
event
would
not
disappoint
you
it
was
important
not
to
be
a
fool
but
it
was
very
hard
the
system
of
democritus
was
adopted
by
epicurus
but
not
because
epicurus
had
any
keenness
of
scientific
vision
on
the
contrary
epicurus
the
herbert
spencer
of
antiquity
was
in
his
natural
philosophy
an
encyclopaedia
of
knowledge
prolix
and
minute
vague
and
inconsistent
he
gathered
his
scientific
miscellany
with
an
eye
fixed
not
on
nature
but
on
the
exigencies
of
an
inward
faith
a
faith
accepted
on
moral
grounds
deemed
necessary
to
salvation
and
defended
at
all
costs
with
any
available
weapon
it
is
instructive
that
materialism
should
have
been
adopted
at
that
juncture
on
the
same
irrelevant
moral
grounds
on
which
it
has
usually
been
rejected
epicurus
strange
as
it
may
sound
to
those
who
have
heard
with
horror
or
envy
of
wallowing
in
his
sty
epicurus
was
a
saint
the
ways
of
the
world
filled
him
with
dismay
the
athens
of
his
time
which
some
of
us
would
give
our
eyes
to
see
retained
all
its
splendour
amid
its
political
decay
but
nothing
there
interested
or
pleased
epicurus
theatres
porches
gymnasiums
and
above
all
the
agora
reeked
to
his
sense
with
vanity
and
folly
retired
in
his
private
garden
with
a
few
friends
and
disciples
he
sought
the
ways
of
peace
he
lived
abstemiously
he
spoke
gently
he
gave
alms
to
the
poor
he
preached
against
wealth
against
ambition
against
passion
he
defended
because
he
wished
to
exercise
it
in
withdrawing
from
the
world
and
in
not
swimming
with
the
current
he
denied
the
supernatural
since
belief
in
it
would
have
a
disquieting
influence
on
the
mind
and
render
too
many
things
compulsory
and
momentous
there
was
no
future
life
the
art
of
living
wisely
must
not
be
distorted
by
such
wild
imaginings
all
things
happened
in
due
course
of
nature
the
gods
were
too
remote
and
too
happy
secluded
like
good
epicureans
to
meddle
with
earthly
things
nothing
ruffled
what
wordsworth
calls
their
voluptuous
unconcern
nevertheless
it
was
pleasant
to
frequent
their
temples
there
as
in
the
spaces
where
they
dwelt
between
the
worlds
the
gods
were
silent
and
beautiful
and
wore
the
human
form
their
statues
when
an
unhappy
man
gazed
at
them
reminded
him
of
happiness
he
was
refreshed
and
weaned
for
a
moment
from
the
senseless
tumult
of
human
affairs
from
those
groves
and
hallowed
sanctuaries
the
philosopher
returned
to
his
garden
strengthened
in
his
wisdom
happier
in
his
isolation
more
friendly
and
more
indifferent
to
all
the
world
thus
the
life
of
epicurus
as
jerome
bears
witness
was
full
of
herbs
fruits
and
abstinences
there
was
a
hush
in
it
as
of
bereavement
his
was
a
philosophy
of
the
decadence
a
philosophy
of
negation
and
of
flight
from
the
world
although
science
for
its
own
sake
could
not
interest
so
monkish
a
nature
yet
science
might
be
useful
in
buttressing
the
faith
or
in
removing
objections
to
it
epicurus
therefore
departed
from
the
reserve
of
socrates
and
looked
for
a
natural
philosophy
that
might
support
his
ethics
of
all
the
systems
extant
and
they
were
legion
he
found
that
of
democritus
the
most
helpful
and
edifying
better
than
any
other
it
would
persuade
men
to
renounce
the
madness
that
must
be
renounced
and
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
that
may
be
enjoyed
but
since
it
was
adopted
on
these
external
and
pragmatic
grounds
the
system
of
democritus
did
not
need
to
be
adopted
entire
in
fact
one
change
at
least
was
imperative
the
motion
of
the
atoms
must
not
be
wholly
regular
and
mechanical
chance
must
be
admitted
that
fate
might
be
removed
fate
was
a
terrifying
notion
it
was
spoken
of
by
the
people
with
superstitious
unction
chance
was
something
humbler
more
congenial
to
the
man
in
the
street
if
only
the
atoms
were
allowed
to
deflect
a
little
now
and
then
from
their
courses
the
future
might
remain
unpredictable
and
might
be
saved
therefore
epicurus
decreed
that
the
atoms
deflected
and
fantastic
arguments
were
added
to
show
that
this
intrusion
of
chance
would
aid
in
the
organization
of
nature
for
the
declension
of
the
atoms
as
it
is
called
would
explain
how
the
original
parallel
downpour
of
them
might
have
yielded
to
vortices
and
so
to
organized
bodies
let
us
pass
on
materialism
like
any
system
of
natural
philosophy
carries
with
it
no
commandments
and
no
advice
it
merely
describes
the
world
including
the
aspirations
and
consciences
of
mortals
and
refers
all
to
a
material
ground
the
materialist
being
a
man
will
not
fail
to
have
preferences
and
even
a
conscience
of
his
own
but
his
precepts
and
policy
will
express
not
the
logical
implications
of
his
science
but
his
human
instincts
as
inheritance
and
experience
may
have
shaped
them
any
system
of
ethics
might
accordingly
coexist
with
materialism
for
if
materialism
declares
certain
things
like
immortality
to
be
impossible
it
can
not
declare
them
to
be
undesirable
nevertheless
it
is
not
likely
that
a
man
so
constituted
as
to
embrace
materialism
will
be
so
constituted
as
to
pursue
things
which
he
considers
unattainable
there
is
therefore
a
psychological
though
no
logical
bond
between
materialism
and
a
homely
morality
the
materialist
is
primarily
an
observer
and
he
will
probably
be
such
in
ethics
also
that
is
he
will
have
no
ethics
except
the
emotion
produced
upon
him
by
the
march
of
the
world
if
he
is
an
and
really
disinterested
he
will
love
life
as
we
all
love
perfect
vitality
or
what
strikes
us
as
such
in
gulls
and
porpoises
this
i
think
is
the
ethical
sentiment
psychologically
consonant
with
a
vigorous
materialism
sympathy
with
the
movement
of
things
interest
in
the
rising
wave
delight
at
the
foam
it
bursts
into
before
it
sinks
again
nature
does
not
distinguish
the
better
from
the
worse
but
the
lover
of
nature
does
he
calls
better
what
being
analogous
to
his
own
life
enhances
his
vitality
and
probably
possesses
some
vitality
of
its
own
this
is
the
ethical
feeling
of
spinoza
the
greatest
of
modern
naturalists
in
philosophy
and
we
shall
see
how
lucretius
in
spite
of
his
fidelity
to
the
ascetic
epicurus
is
carried
by
his
poetic
ecstasy
in
the
same
direction
but
mark
the
crux
of
this
union
the
materialist
will
love
the
life
of
nature
when
he
loves
his
own
life
but
if
he
should
hate
his
own
life
how
should
the
life
of
nature
please
him
now
epicurus
for
the
most
part
hated
life
his
moral
system
called
hedonism
recommends
that
sort
of
pleasure
which
has
no
excitement
and
no
risk
about
it
this
ideal
is
modest
and
even
chaste
but
it
is
not
vital
epicurus
was
remarkable
for
his
mercy
his
friendliness
his
utter
horror
of
war
of
sacrifice
of
suffering
these
are
not
sentiments
that
a
genuine
naturalist
would
be
apt
to
share
pity
and
repentance
spinoza
said
were
vain
and
evil
what
increased
a
man
power
and
his
joy
increased
his
goodness
also
the
naturalist
will
believe
in
a
certain
hardness
as
nietzsche
did
he
will
incline
to
a
certain
scorn
as
the
laughter
of
democritus
was
scornful
he
will
not
count
too
scrupulously
the
cost
of
what
he
achieves
he
will
be
an
imperialist
rapt
in
the
joy
of
achieving
something
in
a
word
the
moral
hue
of
materialism
in
a
formative
age
or
in
an
aggressive
mind
would
be
aristocratic
and
imaginative
but
in
a
decadent
age
or
in
a
soul
that
is
renouncing
everything
it
would
be
as
in
epicurus
humanitarian
and
timidly
sensual
we
have
now
before
us
the
antecedents
and
components
of
lucretius
poem
on
nature
there
remains
the
genius
of
the
poet
himself
the
greatest
thing
about
this
genius
is
its
power
of
losing
itself
in
its
object
its
impersonality
we
seem
to
be
reading
not
the
poetry
of
a
poet
about
things
but
the
poetry
of
things
themselves
that
things
have
their
poetry
not
because
of
what
we
make
them
symbols
of
but
because
of
their
own
movement
and
life
is
what
lucretius
proves
once
for
all
to
mankind
of
course
the
poetry
we
see
in
nature
is
due
to
the
emotion
the
spectacle
produces
in
us
the
life
of
nature
might
be
as
romantic
and
sublime
as
it
chose
it
would
be
dust
and
ashes
to
us
if
there
were
nothing
sublime
and
romantic
in
ourselves
to
be
stirred
by
it
to
sympathy
but
our
emotion
may
be
ingenuous
it
may
be
concerned
with
what
nature
really
is
and
does
has
been
and
will
do
for
ever
it
need
not
arise
from
a
selfish
preoccupation
with
what
these
immense
realities
involve
for
our
own
persons
or
may
be
used
to
suggest
to
our
fancy
no
the
poetry
of
nature
may
be
discerned
merely
by
the
power
of
intuition
which
it
awakens
and
the
understanding
which
it
employs
these
faculties
more
i
should
say
than
our
moodiness
or
stuffy
dreams
draw
taut
the
strings
of
the
soul
and
bring
out
her
full
vitality
and
music
naturalism
is
a
philosophy
of
observation
and
of
an
imagination
that
extends
the
observable
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
nature
enter
into
it
and
lend
it
their
directness
pungency
and
coercive
stress
at
the
same
time
naturalism
is
an
intellectual
philosophy
it
divines
substance
behind
appearance
continuity
behind
change
law
behind
fortune
it
therefore
attaches
all
those
sights
and
sounds
to
a
hidden
background
that
connects
and
explains
them
so
understood
nature
has
depth
as
well
as
surface
force
and
necessity
as
well
as
sensuous
variety
before
the
sublimity
of
this
insight
all
forms
of
the
pathetic
fallacy
seem
cheap
and
artificial
mythology
that
to
a
childish
mind
is
the
only
possible
poetry
sounds
like
bad
rhetoric
in
comparison
the
naturalistic
poet
abandons
fairy
land
because
he
has
discovered
nature
history
the
actual
passions
of
man
his
imagination
has
reached
maturity
its
pleasure
is
to
dominate
not
to
play
poetic
dominion
over
things
as
they
are
is
seen
best
in
shakespeare
for
the
ways
of
men
and
in
lucretius
for
the
ways
of
nature
unapproachably
vivid
relentless
direct
in
detail
he
is
unflinchingly
grand
and
serious
in
his
grouping
of
the
facts
it
is
the
truth
that
absorbs
him
and
carries
him
along
he
wishes
us
to
be
convinced
and
sobered
by
the
fact
by
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
thing
after
thing
raining
down
upon
us
all
bearing
witness
with
one
voice
to
the
nature
of
the
world
suppose
however
and
it
is
a
tenable
supposition
that
lucretius
is
quite
wrong
in
his
science
and
that
there
is
no
space
no
substance
and
no
nature
his
poem
would
then
lose
its
pertinence
to
our
lives
and
personal
convictions
it
would
not
lose
its
imaginative
grandeur
we
could
still
conceive
a
world
composed
as
he
describes
fancy
what
emotions
those
who
lived
in
such
a
world
would
have
felt
on
the
day
when
a
democritus
or
a
lucretius
revealed
to
them
their
actual
situation
how
great
the
blindness
or
the
madness
dissipated
and
how
wonderful
the
vision
gained
how
clear
the
future
how
intelligible
the
past
how
marvellous
the
swarming
atoms
in
their
unintentional
perpetual
fertility
what
the
sky
is
to
our
eyes
on
a
starry
night
that
every
nook
and
cranny
of
nature
would
resemble
with
here
and
there
the
tentative
smile
of
life
playing
about
those
constellations
surely
that
universe
for
those
who
lived
in
it
would
have
had
its
poetry
it
would
have
been
the
poetry
of
naturalism
lucretius
thinking
he
lived
in
such
a
world
heard
the
music
of
it
and
wrote
it
down
and
yet
when
he
set
himself
to
make
his
poem
out
of
the
system
of
epicurus
the
greatness
of
that
task
seems
to
have
overwhelmed
him
he
was
to
unfold
for
the
first
time
in
sonorous
but
unwieldy
latin
the
birth
and
nature
of
all
things
as
greek
subtlety
had
discerned
them
he
was
to
dispel
superstition
to
refute
antagonists
to
lay
the
sure
foundations
of
science
and
of
wisdom
to
summon
mankind
compellingly
from
its
cruel
passions
and
follies
to
a
life
of
simplicity
and
peace
he
was
himself
combative
and
distracted
enough
as
it
is
often
our
troubles
more
than
our
attainments
that
determine
our
ideals
yet
in
heralding
the
advent
of
human
happiness
and
in
painting
that
of
the
gods
he
was
to
attain
his
own
soaring
upon
the
strong
wings
of
his
hexameters
into
an
ecstasy
of
contemplation
and
enthusiasm
when
it
is
so
great
an
emotion
to
read
these
verses
what
must
it
have
been
to
compose
them
yet
could
he
succeed
could
such
great
things
fall
to
his
lot
yes
they
might
if
only
the
creative
forces
of
nature
always
infinite
and
always
at
hand
could
pass
into
his
brain
and
into
his
spirit
if
only
the
seeds
of
corruption
and
madness
which
were
always
coursing
through
the
air
could
be
blown
back
for
a
moment
and
if
the
din
of
civil
conflicts
could
be
suspended
while
he
thought
and
wrote
to
a
fortunate
conjunction
of
atoms
a
child
owes
his
first
being
to
a
propitious
season
and
atmosphere
a
poet
owes
his
inspiration
and
his
success
conscious
that
his
undertaking
hangs
upon
these
chance
conjunctions
lucretius
begins
by
invoking
the
powers
he
is
about
to
describe
that
they
may
give
him
breath
and
genius
enough
to
describe
them
and
at
once
these
powers
send
him
a
happy
inspiration
perhaps
a
happy
reminiscence
of
empedocles
there
are
two
great
perspectives
which
the
moralist
may
distinguish
in
the
universal
drift
of
atoms
creative
movement
producing
what
the
moralist
values
and
a
destructive
movement
abolishing
the
same
lucretius
knows
very
well
that
this
distinction
is
moral
only
or
as
people
now
say
subjective
no
one
else
has
pointed
out
so
often
and
so
clearly
as
he
that
nothing
arises
in
this
world
not
helped
to
life
by
the
death
of
some
other
thing
so
that
the
destructive
movement
creates
and
the
creative
movement
destroys
yet
from
the
point
of
view
of
any
particular
life
or
interest
the
distinction
between
a
creative
force
and
a
destructive
force
is
real
and
to
make
it
is
not
to
deny
the
mechanical
structure
of
nature
but
only
to
show
how
this
mechanical
structure
is
fruitful
morally
how
the
outlying
parts
of
it
are
friendly
or
hostile
to
me
or
to
you
its
local
and
living
products
this
double
colouring
of
things
is
supremely
interesting
to
the
philosopher
so
much
so
that
before
his
physical
science
has
reached
the
mechanical
stage
he
will
doubtless
regard
the
double
aspect
which
things
present
to
him
as
a
dual
principle
in
these
things
themselves
so
empedocles
had
spoken
of
love
and
strife
as
two
forces
which
respectively
gathered
and
disrupted
the
elements
so
as
to
carry
on
between
them
the
penelope
labour
of
the
world
the
one
perpetually
weaving
fresh
forms
of
life
and
the
other
perpetually
undoing
them
it
needed
but
a
slight
concession
to
traditional
rhetoric
in
order
to
exchange
these
names
love
and
strife
which
designated
divine
powers
in
empedocles
into
the
names
of
venus
and
mars
which
designated
the
same
influences
in
roman
mythology
the
mars
and
venus
of
lucretius
are
not
moral
forces
incompatible
with
the
mechanism
of
atoms
they
are
this
mechanism
itself
in
so
far
as
it
now
produces
and
now
destroys
life
or
any
precious
enterprise
like
this
of
lucretius
in
composing
his
saving
poem
mars
and
venus
linked
in
each
other
arms
rule
the
universe
together
nothing
arises
save
by
the
death
of
some
other
thing
yet
when
what
arises
is
happier
in
itself
or
more
congenial
to
us
than
what
is
destroyed
the
poet
says
that
venus
prevails
that
she
woos
her
captive
lover
to
suspend
his
unprofitable
raging
at
such
times
it
is
spring
on
earth
the
storms
recede
i
paraphrase
the
opening
passage
the
fields
are
covered
with
flowers
the
sunshine
floods
the
serene
sky
and
all
the
tribes
of
animals
feel
the
mighty
impulse
of
venus
in
their
hearts
the
corn
ripens
in
the
plains
and
even
the
sea
bears
in
safety
the
fleets
that
traverse
it
not
least
however
of
these
works
of
venus
is
the
roman
people
never
was
the
formative
power
of
nature
better
illustrated
than
in
the
vitality
of
this
race
which
conquered
so
many
other
races
or
than
in
its
assimilative
power
which
civilized
and
pacified
them
legend
had
made
venus
the
mother
of
aeneas
and
aeneas
the
progenitor
of
the
romans
lucretius
seizes
on
this
happy
accident
and
identifies
the
venus
of
fable
with
the
true
venus
the
propitious
power
in
all
nature
of
which
rome
was
indeed
a
crowning
work
but
the
poet
work
also
if
it
is
to
be
accomplished
worthily
must
look
to
the
same
propitious
movement
for
its
happy
issue
and
for
its
power
to
persuade
venus
must
be
the
patron
of
his
art
and
philosophy
she
must
keep
memmius
from
the
wars
that
he
may
read
and
be
weaned
from
frivolous
ambitions
and
she
must
stop
the
tumult
of
constant
sedition
that
lucretius
may
lend
his
undivided
mind
to
the
precepts
of
epicurus
and
his
whole
heart
to
a
sublime
friendship
which
prompts
him
to
devote
to
intense
study
all
the
watches
of
the
starry
night
plotting
the
course
of
each
invisible
atom
and
mounting
almost
to
the
seat
of
the
gods
this
impersonation
in
the
figure
of
venus
of
whatever
makes
for
life
would
not
be
legitimate
it
would
really
contradict
a
mechanical
view
of
nature
if
it
were
not
balanced
by
a
figure
representing
the
opposite
tendency
the
no
less
universal
tendency
towards
death
the
mars
of
the
opening
passage
subdued
for
a
moment
by
the
blandishments
of
love
is
raging
in
all
the
rest
of
the
poem
in
his
irrepressible
fury
these
are
the
two
sides
of
every
transmutation
that
in
creating
one
thing
destroys
another
and
this
transmutation
being
perpetual
nothing
being
durable
except
the
void
the
atoms
and
their
motion
it
follows
that
the
tendency
towards
death
is
for
any
particular
thing
the
final
and
victorious
tendency
the
names
of
venus
and
mars
not
being
essential
to
the
poet
thought
are
allowed
to
drop
out
and
the
actual
processes
they
stand
for
are
described
nakedly
yet
if
the
poem
had
ever
been
finished
and
lucretius
had
wished
to
make
the
end
chime
with
the
beginning
and
represent
as
it
were
one
great
cycle
of
the
world
it
is
conceivable
that
he
might
have
placed
at
the
close
a
mythical
passage
to
match
that
at
the
beginning
and
we
might
have
seen
mars
aroused
from
his
luxurious
lethargy
reasserting
his
immortal
nature
and
rushing
firebrand
in
hand
from
the
palace
of
love
to
spread
destruction
throughout
the
universe
till
all
things
should
burn
fiercely
and
be
consumed
together
yet
not
quite
all
for
the
goddess
herself
would
remain
more
divine
and
desirable
than
ever
in
her
averted
beauty
instinctively
into
her
bosom
the
god
of
war
would
sink
again
when
weary
and
drunk
with
slaughter
and
a
new
world
would
arise
from
the
scattered
atoms
of
the
old
these
endless
revolutions
taken
in
themselves
exactly
balance
and
i
am
not
sure
that
impartially
considered
it
is
any
sadder
that
new
worlds
should
arise
than
that
this
world
should
always
continue
besides
nature
can
not
take
from
us
more
than
she
has
given
and
it
would
be
captious
and
thankless
in
us
to
think
of
her
as
destructive
only
or
destructive
essentially
after
the
unspeculative
fashion
of
modern
pessimists
she
destroys
to
create
and
creates
to
destroy
her
interest
if
we
may
express
it
so
being
not
in
particular
things
nor
in
their
continuance
but
solely
in
the
movement
that
underlies
them
in
the
flux
of
substance
beneath
life
however
belongs
to
form
and
not
to
matter
or
in
the
language
of
lucretius
life
is
an
a
redundant
ideal
product
or
incidental
aspect
involved
in
the
equilibration
of
matter
as
the
throw
of
sixes
is
an
a
redundant
ideal
product
or
incidental
aspect
occasionally
involved
in
shaking
a
yet
as
this
throw
makes
the
acme
and
best
possible
issue
of
a
game
of
dice
so
life
is
the
acme
and
best
possible
issue
of
the
dance
of
atoms
and
it
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
this
that
the
whole
process
is
viewed
by
us
and
is
judged
not
until
that
happy
chance
has
taken
place
do
we
exist
morally
or
can
we
reflect
or
judge
at
all
the
philosopher
is
at
the
top
of
the
wave
he
is
the
foam
in
the
rolling
tempest
and
as
the
wave
must
have
risen
before
he
bursts
into
being
all
that
he
lives
to
witness
is
the
fall
of
the
wave
the
decadence
of
all
he
lives
by
is
the
only
prospect
before
him
his
whole
philosophy
must
be
a
prophecy
of
death
of
the
life
that
may
come
after
when
the
atoms
come
together
again
he
can
imagine
nothing
the
life
he
knows
and
shares
all
that
is
life
to
him
is
waning
and
almost
spent
therefore
lucretius
who
is
nothing
if
not
honest
is
possessed
by
a
profound
melancholy
vigorous
and
throbbing
as
are
his
pictures
of
spring
of
love
of
ambition
of
budding
culture
of
intellectual
victory
they
pale
before
the
vivid
strokes
with
which
he
paints
the
approach
of
death
fatigue
of
the
will
lassitude
in
pleasure
corruption
and
disintegration
in
society
the
soil
exhausted
the
wild
animals
tamed
or
exterminated
poverty
pestilence
and
famine
at
hand
and
for
the
individual
almost
at
once
the
final
dissipation
of
the
atoms
of
his
soul
escaping
from
a
relaxed
body
to
mingle
and
lose
themselves
in
the
universal
flaw
nothing
comes
out
of
nothing
nothing
falls
back
into
nothing
if
we
consider
substance
but
everything
comes
from
nothing
and
falls
back
into
nothing
if
we
consider
things
the
objects
of
love
and
of
experience
time
can
make
no
impression
on
the
void
or
on
the
atoms
nay
time
is
itself
an
created
by
the
motion
of
atoms
in
the
void
but
the
triumph
of
time
is
absolute
over
persons
and
nations
and
worlds
in
treating
of
the
soul
and
of
immortality
lucretius
is
an
imperfect
psychologist
and
an
arbitrary
moralist
his
zeal
to
prove
that
the
soul
is
mortal
is
inspired
by
the
wish
to
dispel
all
fear
of
future
punishments
and
so
to
liberate
the
mind
for
the
calm
and
tepid
enjoyment
of
this
world
there
is
something
to
be
gained
in
this
direction
undoubtedly
especially
if
tales
about
divine
vengeance
to
come
are
used
to
sanction
irrational
practices
and
to
prevent
poor
people
from
improving
their
lot
at
the
same
time
it
is
hardly
fair
to
assume
that
hell
is
the
only
prospect
which
immortality
could
possibly
open
to
any
of
us
and
it
is
also
unfair
not
to
observe
that
the
punishments
which
religious
fables
threaten
the
dead
with
are
for
the
most
part
symbols
for
the
actual
degradation
which
brings
upon
the
living
so
that
the
fear
of
hell
is
not
more
deterrent
or
repressive
than
experience
of
life
would
be
if
it
were
clearly
brought
before
the
mind
there
is
another
element
in
this
polemic
against
immortality
which
while
highly
interesting
and
characteristic
of
a
decadent
age
betrays
a
very
and
at
bottom
untenable
ideal
this
element
is
the
fear
of
life
epicurus
had
been
a
pure
and
tender
moralist
but
pusillanimous
he
was
so
afraid
of
hurting
and
of
being
hurt
so
afraid
of
running
risks
or
tempting
fortune
that
he
wished
to
prove
that
human
life
was
a
brief
business
not
subject
to
any
great
transformations
nor
capable
of
any
great
achievements
he
taught
accordingly
that
the
atoms
had
produced
already
all
the
animals
they
could
produce
for
though
infinite
in
number
the
atoms
were
of
few
kinds
consequently
the
possible
sorts
of
being
were
finite
and
soon
exhausted
this
world
though
on
the
eve
of
destruction
was
of
recent
date
the
worlds
around
it
or
to
be
produced
in
future
could
not
afford
anything
essentially
different
all
the
suns
were
much
alike
and
there
was
nothing
new
under
them
we
need
not
then
fear
the
world
it
is
an
explored
and
domestic
scene
a
home
a
little
garden
six
feet
of
earth
for
a
man
to
stretch
in
if
people
rage
and
make
a
great
noise
it
is
not
because
there
is
much
to
win
or
much
to
fear
but
because
people
are
mad
let
me
not
be
mad
thought
epicurus
let
me
be
reasonable
cultivating
sentiments
appropriate
to
a
mortal
who
inhabits
a
world
morally
comfortable
and
small
and
physically
poor
in
its
infinite
monotony
the
lines
of
fitzgerald
echo
this
sentiment
perfectly
book
of
verses
underneath
the
bough
jug
of
wine
a
loaf
of
bread
and
me
singing
in
the
wilderness
wilderness
were
paradise
enow
but
what
if
the
shadow
of
incalculable
possibilities
should
fall
across
this
sunny
retreat
what
if
after
death
we
should
awake
in
a
world
to
which
the
atomic
philosophy
might
not
in
the
least
apply
observe
that
this
suggestion
is
not
in
the
least
opposed
to
any
of
the
arguments
by
which
science
might
prove
the
atomic
theory
to
be
correct
all
that
epicurus
taught
about
the
universe
now
before
us
might
be
perfectly
true
of
it
but
what
if
a
new
universe
should
have
taken
its
place
the
suggestion
is
doubtless
gratuitous
and
no
busy
man
will
be
much
troubled
by
it
yet
when
the
heart
is
empty
it
fills
itself
with
such
attenuated
dreams
the
muffled
pleasures
of
the
wise
man
as
epicurus
conceived
him
were
really
a
provocation
to
supernaturalism
they
left
a
great
void
and
before
long
supernaturalism
we
shall
see
it
in
dante
actually
rushed
in
to
quicken
the
pulses
of
life
with
fresh
hopes
and
illusions
or
at
least
what
may
seem
better
than
nothing
with
terrors
and
fanatical
zeal
with
such
tendencies
already
afoot
as
the
myths
and
dogmas
of
plato
had
betrayed
it
was
imperative
for
epicurus
to
banish
anxiously
all
thought
of
what
might
follow
death
to
this
end
are
all
his
arguments
about
the
material
nature
of
the
soul
and
her
incapacity
to
survive
the
body
to
say
that
the
soul
is
material
has
a
strange
and
barbarous
sound
to
modern
ears
we
live
after
descartes
who
taught
the
world
that
the
essence
of
the
soul
was
consciousness
and
to
call
consciousness
material
would
be
to
talk
of
the
blackness
of
white
but
ancient
usage
gave
the
word
soul
a
rather
different
meaning
the
essence
of
the
soul
was
not
so
much
to
be
conscious
as
to
govern
the
formation
of
the
body
to
warm
move
and
guide
it
and
if
we
think
of
the
soul
exclusively
in
this
light
it
will
not
seem
a
paradox
it
may
even
seem
a
truism
to
say
that
the
soul
must
be
material
for
how
are
we
to
conceive
that
preexisting
consciousness
should
govern
the
formation
of
the
body
move
warm
or
guide
it
a
spirit
capable
of
such
a
miracle
would
in
any
case
not
be
human
but
altogether
divine
the
soul
that
lucretius
calls
material
should
not
then
be
identified
with
consciousness
but
with
the
ground
of
consciousness
which
is
at
the
same
time
the
cause
of
life
in
the
body
this
he
conceives
to
be
a
swarm
of
very
small
and
volatile
atoms
a
sort
of
ether
resident
in
all
living
seeds
breathed
in
abundantly
during
life
and
breathed
out
at
death
even
if
this
theory
were
accepted
however
it
would
not
prove
the
point
which
lucretius
has
chiefly
at
heart
namely
that
an
is
impossible
the
atoms
of
the
soul
are
indestructible
like
all
atoms
and
if
consciousness
were
attached
to
the
fortunes
of
a
small
group
of
them
or
of
one
only
as
leibniz
afterwards
taught
consciousness
would
continue
to
exist
after
these
atoms
had
escaped
from
the
body
and
were
shooting
through
new
fields
of
space
indeed
they
might
be
the
more
aroused
by
that
adventure
as
a
bee
might
find
the
sky
or
the
garden
more
exciting
than
the
hive
all
that
lucretius
urges
about
the
divisibility
of
the
soul
its
diffused
bodily
seat
and
the
perils
it
would
meet
outside
fails
to
remove
the
ominous
possibility
that
troubles
him
to
convince
us
that
we
perish
at
death
he
has
to
rely
on
vulgar
experience
and
inherent
probability
what
changes
is
not
indestructible
what
begins
ends
mental
growth
health
sanity
accompany
the
fortunes
of
the
body
as
a
whole
not
demonstrably
those
of
the
the
passions
are
relevant
to
bodily
life
and
to
an
earthly
situation
we
should
not
be
ourselves
under
a
different
mask
or
in
a
new
setting
we
remember
no
previous
existence
if
we
had
one
and
so
in
a
future
existence
we
should
not
remember
this
these
reflections
are
impressive
and
they
are
enforced
by
lucretius
with
his
usual
vividness
and
smack
of
reality
nothing
is
proved
scientifically
by
such
a
deliverance
yet
it
is
good
philosophy
and
good
poetry
it
brings
much
experience
together
and
passes
a
lofty
judgment
upon
it
the
artist
has
his
eye
on
the
model
he
is
painting
death
to
the
life
if
these
considerations
succeed
in
banishing
the
dread
of
an
there
remains
the
distress
which
many
feel
at
the
idea
of
extinction
and
if
we
have
ceased
to
fear
death
like
hamlet
for
the
dreams
that
may
come
after
it
we
may
still
fear
death
instinctively
like
a
stuck
pig
against
this
instinctive
horror
of
dying
lucretius
has
many
brave
arguments
fools
he
says
to
us
why
do
you
fear
what
never
can
touch
you
while
you
still
live
death
is
absent
and
when
you
are
dead
you
are
so
dead
that
you
can
not
know
you
are
dead
nor
regret
it
you
will
be
as
much
at
ease
as
before
you
were
born
or
is
what
troubles
you
the
childish
fear
of
being
cold
in
the
earth
or
feeling
its
weight
stifling
you
but
you
will
not
be
there
the
atoms
of
your
soul
themselves
unconscious
will
be
dancing
in
some
sunbeam
far
away
and
you
yourself
will
be
nowhere
you
will
absolutely
not
exist
death
is
by
definition
a
state
that
excludes
experience
if
you
fear
it
you
fear
a
word
to
all
this
perhaps
memmius
or
some
other
recalcitrant
reader
might
retort
that
what
he
shrank
from
was
not
the
metaphysical
state
of
being
dead
but
the
very
real
agony
of
dying
dying
is
something
ghastly
as
being
born
is
something
ridiculous
and
even
if
no
pain
were
involved
in
quitting
or
entering
this
world
we
might
still
say
what
francesca
says
of
it
modo
ancor
m
i
shudder
at
the
way
of
it
lucretius
for
his
part
makes
no
attempt
to
show
that
everything
is
as
it
should
be
and
if
our
way
of
coming
into
this
life
is
ignoble
and
our
way
of
leaving
it
pitiful
that
is
no
fault
of
his
nor
of
his
philosophy
if
the
fear
of
death
were
merely
the
fear
of
dying
it
would
be
better
dealt
with
by
medicine
than
by
argument
there
is
or
there
might
be
an
art
of
dying
well
of
dying
painlessly
willingly
and
in
season
as
in
those
noble
partings
which
attic
gravestones
depict
especially
if
we
were
allowed
as
lucretius
would
allow
us
to
choose
our
own
time
but
the
radical
fear
of
death
i
venture
to
think
is
something
quite
different
it
is
the
love
of
life
epicurus
who
feared
life
seems
to
have
missed
here
the
primordial
and
colossal
force
he
was
fighting
against
had
he
perceived
that
force
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
meet
it
in
a
more
radical
way
by
an
enveloping
movement
as
it
were
and
an
attack
from
the
rear
the
love
of
life
is
not
something
rational
or
founded
on
experience
of
life
it
is
something
antecedent
and
spontaneous
it
is
that
venus
genetrix
which
covers
the
earth
with
its
flora
and
fauna
it
teaches
every
animal
to
seek
its
food
and
its
mate
and
to
protect
its
offspring
as
also
to
resist
or
fly
from
all
injury
to
the
body
and
most
of
all
from
threatened
death
it
is
the
original
impulse
by
which
good
is
discriminated
from
evil
and
hope
from
fear
nothing
could
be
more
futile
therefore
than
to
marshal
arguments
against
that
fear
of
death
which
is
merely
another
name
for
the
energy
of
life
or
the
tendency
to
arguments
involve
premises
and
these
premises
in
the
given
case
express
some
particular
form
of
the
love
of
life
whence
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
death
is
in
no
degree
evil
and
not
at
all
to
be
feared
for
what
is
most
dreaded
is
not
the
agony
of
dying
nor
yet
the
strange
impossibility
that
when
we
do
not
exist
we
should
suffer
for
not
existing
what
is
dreaded
is
the
defeat
of
a
present
will
directed
upon
life
and
its
various
undertakings
such
a
present
will
can
not
be
argued
away
but
it
may
be
weakened
by
contradictions
arising
within
it
by
the
irony
of
experience
or
by
ascetic
discipline
to
introduce
ascetic
discipline
to
bring
out
the
irony
of
experience
to
expose
the
of
the
will
would
be
the
true
means
of
mitigating
the
love
of
life
and
if
the
love
of
life
were
extinguished
the
fear
of
death
like
smoke
rising
from
that
fire
would
have
vanished
also
indeed
the
force
of
the
great
passage
against
the
fear
of
death
at
the
end
of
the
third
book
of
lucretius
comes
chiefly
from
the
picture
it
draws
of
the
madness
of
life
his
philosophy
deprecates
covetousness
ambition
love
and
religion
it
takes
a
long
step
towards
the
surrender
of
life
by
surrendering
all
in
life
that
is
ardent
on
the
ground
that
it
is
painful
in
the
end
and
ignominious
to
escape
from
it
all
is
a
great
deliverance
and
since
genius
must
be
ardent
about
something
lucretius
pours
out
his
enthusiasm
on
epicurus
who
brought
this
deliverance
and
was
the
saviour
of
mankind
yet
this
was
only
a
beginning
of
salvation
and
the
same
principles
carried
further
would
have
delivered
us
from
the
epicurean
life
and
what
it
retained
that
was
greek
and
naturalistic
science
friendship
and
the
healthy
pleasures
of
the
body
had
it
renounced
these
things
also
epicureanism
would
have
become
altogether
ascetic
a
thorough
system
of
mortification
or
the
pursuit
of
death
to
those
who
sincerely
pursue
death
death
is
no
evil
but
the
highest
good
no
need
in
that
case
of
elaborate
arguments
to
prove
that
death
should
not
be
feared
because
it
is
nothing
for
in
spite
of
being
nothing
or
rather
because
it
is
nothing
death
can
be
loved
by
a
fatigued
and
disillusioned
spirit
just
as
in
spite
of
being
nothing
or
rather
because
it
is
nothing
it
must
be
hated
and
feared
by
every
vigorous
animal
one
more
point
and
i
have
done
with
this
subject
ancient
culture
was
rhetorical
it
abounded
in
ideas
that
are
verbally
plausible
and
pass
muster
in
a
public
speech
but
that
if
we
stop
to
criticize
them
prove
at
once
to
be
inexcusably
false
one
of
these
rhetorical
fallacies
is
the
maxim
that
men
can
not
live
for
what
they
can
not
witness
what
does
it
matter
to
you
we
may
say
in
debate
what
happened
before
you
were
born
or
what
may
go
on
after
you
are
buried
and
the
orator
who
puts
such
a
challenge
may
carry
the
audience
with
him
and
raise
a
laugh
at
the
expense
of
human
sincerity
yet
the
very
men
who
applaud
are
proud
of
their
ancestors
care
for
the
future
of
their
children
and
are
very
much
interested
in
securing
legally
the
execution
of
their
last
will
and
testament
what
may
go
on
after
their
death
concerns
them
deeply
not
because
they
expect
to
watch
the
event
from
hell
or
heaven
but
because
they
are
interested
ideally
in
what
that
event
shall
be
although
they
are
never
to
witness
it
lucretius
himself
in
his
sympathy
with
nature
in
his
zeal
for
human
enlightenment
in
his
tears
for
iphigenia
long
since
dead
is
not
moved
by
the
hope
of
observing
or
the
memory
of
having
observed
what
excites
his
emotion
he
forgets
himself
he
sees
the
whole
universe
spread
out
in
its
true
movement
and
proportions
he
sees
mankind
freed
from
the
incubus
of
superstition
and
from
the
havoc
of
passion
the
vision
kindles
his
enthusiasm
exalts
his
imagination
and
swells
his
verse
into
unmistakable
earnestness
if
we
follow
lucretius
therefore
in
narrowing
the
sum
of
our
personal
fortunes
to
one
brief
and
partial
glimpse
of
earth
we
must
not
suppose
that
we
need
narrow
at
all
the
sphere
of
our
moral
interests
on
the
contrary
just
in
proportion
as
we
despise
superstitious
terrors
and
sentimental
hopes
and
as
our
imagination
becomes
we
shall
strengthen
the
direct
and
primitive
concern
which
we
feel
in
the
world
and
in
what
may
go
on
there
before
us
after
us
or
beyond
our
ken
if
like
lucretius
and
every
philosophical
poet
we
range
over
all
time
and
all
existence
we
shall
forget
our
own
persons
as
he
did
and
even
wish
them
to
be
forgotten
if
only
the
things
we
care
for
may
subsist
or
arise
he
who
truly
loves
god
says
spinoza
can
not
wish
that
god
should
love
him
in
return
one
who
lives
the
life
of
the
universe
can
not
be
much
concerned
for
his
own
after
all
the
life
of
the
universe
is
but
the
locus
and
extension
of
ours
the
atoms
that
have
once
served
to
produce
life
remain
fit
to
reproduce
it
and
although
the
body
they
might
animate
later
would
be
a
new
one
and
would
have
a
somewhat
different
career
it
would
not
according
to
lucretius
be
of
a
totally
new
species
perhaps
not
more
unlike
ourselves
than
we
are
unlike
one
another
or
than
each
of
us
is
unlike
himself
at
the
various
stages
of
his
life
the
soul
of
nature
in
the
elements
of
it
is
then
according
to
lucretius
actually
immortal
only
the
human
individuality
the
chance
composition
of
those
elements
is
transitory
so
that
if
a
man
could
care
for
what
happens
to
other
men
for
what
befell
him
when
young
or
what
may
overtake
him
when
old
he
might
perfectly
well
care
on
the
same
imaginative
principle
for
what
may
go
on
in
the
world
for
ever
the
finitude
and
injustice
of
his
personal
life
would
be
broken
down
the
illusion
of
selfishness
would
be
dissipated
and
he
might
say
to
himself
i
have
imagination
and
nothing
that
is
real
is
alien
to
me
the
word
nature
has
many
senses
but
if
we
preserve
the
one
which
etymology
justifies
and
which
is
the
most
philosophical
as
well
nature
should
mean
the
principle
of
birth
or
genesis
the
universal
mother
the
great
cause
or
system
of
causes
that
brings
phenomena
to
light
if
we
take
the
word
nature
in
this
sense
it
may
be
said
that
lucretius
more
than
any
other
man
is
the
poet
of
nature
of
course
being
an
ancient
he
is
not
particularly
a
poet
of
landscape
he
runs
deeper
than
that
he
is
a
poet
of
the
source
of
landscape
a
poet
of
matter
a
poet
of
landscape
might
try
to
suggest
by
words
the
sensations
of
light
movement
and
form
which
nature
arouses
in
us
but
in
this
attempt
he
would
encounter
the
insuperable
difficulty
which
lessing
long
ago
pointed
out
and
warned
poets
of
i
mean
the
unfitness
of
language
to
render
what
is
spatial
and
material
its
fitness
to
render
only
what
like
language
itself
is
bodiless
and
flowing
action
feeling
and
thought
it
is
noticeable
accordingly
that
poets
who
are
fascinated
by
pure
sense
and
seek
to
write
poems
about
it
are
called
not
impressionists
but
symbolists
for
in
trying
to
render
some
absolute
sensation
they
render
rather
the
field
of
association
in
which
that
sensation
lies
or
the
emotions
and
that
shoot
and
play
about
it
in
their
fancy
they
become
against
their
will
perhaps
psychological
poets
ringers
of
mental
chimes
and
listeners
for
the
chance
overtones
of
consciousness
hence
we
call
them
symbolists
mixing
perhaps
some
shade
of
disparagement
in
the
term
as
if
they
were
symbolists
of
an
empty
or
fatuous
sort
for
they
play
with
things
luxuriously
making
them
symbols
for
their
thoughts
instead
of
mending
their
thoughts
intelligently
to
render
them
symbols
for
things
a
poet
might
be
a
symbolist
in
another
sense
if
he
broke
up
nature
the
object
suggested
by
landscape
to
the
mind
and
reverted
to
the
elements
of
landscape
not
in
order
to
associate
these
sensations
lazily
together
but
in
order
to
build
out
of
them
in
fancy
a
different
nature
a
better
world
than
that
which
they
reveal
to
reason
the
elements
of
landscape
chosen
emphasized
and
recombined
for
this
purpose
would
then
be
symbols
for
the
ideal
world
they
were
made
to
suggest
and
for
the
ideal
life
that
might
be
led
in
that
paradise
shelley
is
a
symbolic
landscape
poet
in
this
sense
to
shelley
as
francis
thompson
has
said
nature
was
a
his
fancy
took
the
materials
of
the
landscape
and
wove
them
into
a
gossamer
world
a
bright
ethereal
habitation
for
irresponsible
spirits
shelley
was
the
musician
of
landscape
he
traced
out
its
unrealized
suggestions
transformed
the
things
he
saw
into
the
things
he
would
fain
have
seen
in
this
idealization
it
was
spirit
that
guided
him
the
bent
of
his
wild
and
exquisite
imagination
and
he
fancied
sometimes
that
the
grosser
landscapes
of
earth
were
likewise
the
work
of
some
stress
of
some
restlessly
dreaming
power
in
this
sense
earthly
landscape
seemed
to
him
the
symbol
of
the
earth
spirit
as
the
starlit
crystal
landscapes
of
his
verse
with
their
pensive
flowers
were
symbols
in
which
his
own
fevered
spirit
was
expressed
images
in
which
his
passion
rested
another
sort
of
landscape
poetry
is
to
be
found
in
wordsworth
for
whom
the
title
of
poet
of
nature
might
perhaps
be
claimed
to
him
the
landscape
is
an
influence
what
he
renders
beyond
such
pictorial
touches
as
language
is
capable
of
is
the
moral
inspiration
which
the
scene
brings
to
him
this
moral
inspiration
is
not
drawn
at
all
from
the
real
processes
of
nature
which
every
landscape
manifests
in
some
aspect
and
for
one
moment
such
would
have
been
the
method
of
lucretius
he
would
have
passed
imaginatively
from
the
landscape
to
the
sources
of
the
landscape
he
would
have
disclosed
the
poetry
of
matter
not
of
spirit
wordsworth
on
the
contrary
dwells
on
adventitious
human
matters
he
is
no
poet
of
genesis
evolution
and
natural
force
in
its
myriad
manifestations
only
a
part
of
the
cosmic
process
engages
his
interest
or
touches
his
soul
the
strengthening
or
chastening
of
human
purposes
by
the
influences
of
landscape
these
influences
are
very
real
for
as
food
or
wine
keeps
the
animal
heart
beating
or
quickens
it
so
large
spaces
of
calm
sky
or
mountains
or
dells
or
solitary
stretches
of
water
expand
the
breast
disperse
the
obsessions
that
cramp
a
daily
existence
and
even
if
he
be
less
contemplative
and
less
virtuous
than
wordsworth
make
him
for
the
moment
a
friend
to
all
things
and
a
friend
to
himself
yet
these
influences
are
vague
and
for
the
most
part
fleeting
wordsworth
would
hardly
have
felt
them
so
distinctly
and
so
constantly
had
he
not
found
a
further
link
to
bind
landscape
to
moral
sentiment
such
a
link
exists
the
landscape
is
the
scene
of
human
life
every
spot
every
season
is
associated
with
the
sort
of
existence
which
falls
to
men
in
that
environment
landscape
for
wordsworth
age
and
in
his
country
was
seldom
without
figures
at
least
some
visible
trace
of
man
guided
the
poet
and
set
the
key
for
his
moral
meditation
country
life
was
no
less
dear
to
wordsworth
than
landscape
was
it
fitted
into
every
picture
and
while
the
march
of
things
as
lucretius
conceived
it
was
not
present
to
wordsworth
imagination
the
revolutions
of
society
the
french
revolution
for
instance
were
constantly
in
his
thoughts
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
poet
of
human
life
wordsworth
was
truly
a
poet
of
nature
in
so
far
however
as
he
was
a
poet
of
landscape
he
was
still
fundamentally
a
poet
of
human
life
or
merely
of
his
personal
experience
when
he
talked
of
nature
he
was
generally
moralizing
and
altogether
subject
to
the
pathetic
fallacy
but
when
he
talked
of
man
or
of
himself
he
was
unfolding
a
part
of
nature
the
upright
human
heart
and
studying
it
in
its
truth
lucretius
a
poet
of
universal
nature
studied
everything
in
its
truth
even
moral
life
though
he
felt
it
much
more
narrowly
and
coldly
than
wordsworth
did
was
better
understood
and
better
sung
by
him
for
being
seen
in
its
natural
setting
it
is
a
fault
of
idealists
to
misrepresent
idealism
because
they
do
not
view
it
as
a
part
of
the
world
idealism
a
part
of
the
world
a
small
and
dependent
part
of
it
it
is
a
small
and
dependent
part
even
in
the
life
of
men
this
fact
is
nothing
against
idealism
taken
as
a
moral
energy
as
a
faculty
of
idealization
and
a
habit
of
living
in
the
familiar
presence
of
an
image
of
what
would
in
everything
be
best
but
it
is
the
ruin
of
idealism
taken
as
a
view
of
the
central
and
universal
power
in
the
world
for
this
reason
lucretius
who
sees
human
life
and
human
idealism
in
their
natural
setting
has
a
saner
and
maturer
view
of
both
than
has
wordsworth
for
all
his
greater
refinement
nature
for
the
latin
poet
is
really
nature
he
loves
and
fears
her
as
she
deserves
to
be
loved
and
feared
by
her
creatures
whether
it
be
a
wind
blowing
a
torrent
rushing
a
lamb
bleating
the
magic
of
love
genius
achieving
its
purpose
or
a
war
or
a
pestilence
lucretius
sees
everything
in
its
causes
and
in
its
total
career
one
breath
of
lavish
creation
one
iron
law
of
change
runs
through
the
whole
making
all
things
kin
in
their
inmost
elements
and
in
their
last
end
here
is
the
touch
of
nature
indeed
her
largeness
and
eternity
here
is
the
true
echo
of
the
life
of
matter
any
comprehensive
picture
of
nature
and
destiny
if
the
picture
be
credited
must
arouse
emotion
and
in
a
reflective
and
vivid
mind
must
inspire
poetry
for
what
is
poetry
but
emotion
fixing
and
colouring
the
objects
from
which
it
springs
the
sublime
poem
of
lucretius
expounding
the
least
poetical
of
philosophies
proves
this
point
beyond
a
doubt
yet
lucretius
was
far
from
exhausting
the
inspiration
which
a
poet
might
draw
from
materialism
in
the
philosophy
of
epicurus
even
which
had
but
a
sickly
hold
on
materialism
there
were
two
strains
which
lucretius
did
not
take
up
and
which
are
naturally
rich
in
poetry
the
strain
of
piety
and
the
strain
of
friendship
it
is
usual
and
in
one
sense
legitimate
to
speak
of
the
epicureans
as
atheists
since
they
denied
providence
and
any
government
of
god
in
the
world
yet
they
admitted
the
existence
of
gods
living
in
the
quiet
spaces
between
those
celestial
whirlpools
which
form
the
various
worlds
to
these
gods
they
attributed
the
human
form
and
the
serene
life
to
which
epicurus
aspired
epicurus
himself
was
so
sincere
in
this
belief
and
so
much
affected
by
it
that
he
used
to
frequent
the
temples
keep
the
feasts
of
the
gods
and
often
spend
hours
before
their
images
in
contemplation
and
prayer
in
this
as
in
much
else
epicurus
was
carrying
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
rational
and
reforming
essence
of
hellenism
in
greek
religion
as
in
all
other
religions
there
was
a
background
of
vulgar
superstition
survivals
and
revivals
of
taboo
magic
ritual
barter
and
objectified
rhetoric
are
to
be
found
in
it
to
the
very
end
yet
if
we
consider
in
greek
religion
its
characteristic
tendency
and
what
rendered
it
distinctively
greek
we
see
that
it
was
its
unprecedented
ideality
disinterestedness
and
aestheticism
to
the
greek
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
greek
religion
was
an
aspiration
to
grow
like
the
gods
by
invoking
their
companionship
rehearsing
their
story
feeling
vicariously
the
glow
of
their
splendid
prerogatives
and
placing
them
in
the
form
of
beautiful
and
very
human
statues
constantly
before
his
eyes
this
sympathetic
interest
in
the
immortals
took
the
place
in
the
typical
greek
mind
of
any
vivid
hope
of
human
immortality
perhaps
it
made
such
a
hope
seem
superfluous
and
inappropriate
mortality
belonged
to
man
as
immortality
to
the
gods
and
the
one
was
the
complement
of
the
other
imagine
a
poet
who
to
the
freedom
and
simplicity
of
homer
should
have
added
the
more
reverent
idealism
of
a
later
age
and
what
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
poetry
might
he
not
have
found
in
this
conception
of
the
immortals
leading
a
human
life
without
its
sordid
contrarieties
and
limitations
eternally
young
and
frank
and
different
hints
of
such
poetry
are
to
be
found
in
plato
myths
that
present
the
ideal
suggestions
of
human
life
in
pictures
these
he
sometimes
leaves
general
and
pale
calling
them
ideas
but
at
other
times
he
embodies
them
in
deities
or
in
detailed
imaginary
constructions
like
that
of
his
this
platonic
habit
of
mind
might
have
been
carried
further
by
some
franker
and
less
reactionary
poet
than
plato
was
or
tended
to
become
as
the
years
turned
his
wine
into
vinegar
but
the
whole
world
was
then
getting
sour
imagination
flagged
or
was
diverted
from
the
greek
into
the
hebrew
channel
nevertheless
the
hymns
of
modern
poets
to
the
ancient
gods
and
the
irrepressible
echoes
of
classic
mythology
in
our
literature
show
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
the
later
ancients
themselves
had
they
chosen
to
make
immortal
poetry
out
of
their
dying
superstitions
the
denials
of
epicurus
do
not
exclude
this
ideal
use
of
religion
on
the
contrary
by
excluding
all
the
other
uses
of
it
the
commercial
the
and
the
selfish
they
leave
the
moral
interpretative
aspect
of
religion
standing
alone
ready
to
the
poet
hand
if
any
poet
could
be
found
pure
and
fertile
enough
to
catch
and
to
render
it
rationalized
paganism
might
have
had
its
dante
a
dante
who
should
have
been
the
pupil
not
of
virgil
and
aquinas
but
of
homer
and
plato
lucretius
was
too
literal
positivistic
and
insistent
for
such
a
delicate
task
he
was
a
roman
moral
mythology
and
ideal
piety
though
his
philosophy
had
room
for
them
formed
no
part
of
his
poetry
what
the
other
neglected
theme
friendship
might
have
supplied
we
may
see
in
the
tone
of
another
epicurean
the
poet
horace
friendship
was
highly
honoured
in
all
ancient
states
and
the
epicurean
philosophy
in
banishing
so
many
traditional
forms
of
sentiment
could
only
intensify
the
emphasis
on
friendship
it
taught
men
that
they
were
an
accident
in
the
universe
comrades
afloat
on
the
same
raft
together
with
no
fate
not
common
to
them
all
and
no
possible
helpers
but
one
another
lucretius
does
speak
in
a
passage
to
which
i
have
already
referred
about
the
hope
of
sweet
friendship
that
supports
him
in
his
labours
and
elsewhere
he
repeats
the
epicurean
idyl
about
picnicking
together
on
the
green
grass
by
a
flowing
brook
but
the
little
word
together
is
all
he
vouchsafes
us
to
mark
what
must
be
the
chief
ingredient
in
such
rural
happiness
horace
usually
so
much
slighter
than
lucretius
is
less
cursory
here
not
only
does
he
strike
much
oftener
the
note
of
friendship
but
his
whole
mind
and
temper
breathe
of
friendliness
and
expected
agreement
there
is
in
the
very
charm
and
artifice
of
his
lines
a
sort
of
confidential
joy
in
tasting
with
the
kindred
few
the
sweet
or
pungent
savour
of
human
things
to
be
brief
and
gently
ironical
is
to
assume
mutual
intelligence
and
to
assume
mutual
intelligence
is
to
believe
in
friendship
in
lucretius
on
the
other
hand
zeal
is
mightier
than
sympathy
and
scorn
mightier
than
humour
perhaps
it
would
be
asking
too
much
of
his
uncompromising
fervour
that
he
should
have
unbent
now
and
then
and
shown
us
in
some
detail
what
those
pleasures
of
life
may
be
which
are
without
care
and
fear
yet
if
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
be
always
serious
and
austere
he
might
at
least
have
noted
the
melancholy
of
friendship
for
friendship
where
nature
has
made
minds
isolated
and
bodies
mortal
is
rich
also
in
melancholy
this
again
we
may
find
in
horace
where
once
or
twice
he
lets
the
something
bitter
bubble
up
from
the
heart
even
of
this
flower
when
he
feels
a
vague
need
that
survives
satiety
and
yearns
perversely
for
the
impossible
poor
epicureans
when
they
could
not
learn
like
their
master
to
be
saints
so
far
the
decadent
materialism
of
epicurus
might
have
carried
a
poet
but
a
materialist
in
our
days
might
find
many
other
poetic
themes
to
weave
into
his
system
to
the
picture
which
lucretius
sketches
of
primitive
civilization
we
might
add
the
whole
history
of
mankind
to
a
consistent
and
vigorous
materialism
all
personal
and
national
dramas
with
the
beauties
of
all
the
arts
are
no
less
natural
and
interesting
than
are
flowers
or
animal
bodies
the
moral
pageantry
of
this
world
surveyed
scientifically
is
calculated
wonderfully
to
strengthen
and
refine
the
philosophy
of
abstention
suggested
to
epicurus
by
the
flux
of
material
things
and
by
the
illusions
of
vulgar
passion
lucretius
studies
superstition
but
only
as
an
enemy
and
the
naturalistic
poet
should
be
the
enemy
of
nothing
his
animus
blinds
him
to
half
the
object
to
its
more
beautiful
half
and
makes
us
distrust
his
version
of
the
meaner
half
he
is
aware
of
seen
in
its
totality
and
surrounded
by
all
the
other
products
of
human
imagination
superstition
is
not
only
moving
in
itself
a
capital
subject
for
tragedy
and
for
comedy
but
it
reinforces
the
materialistic
way
of
thinking
and
shows
that
it
may
be
extended
to
the
most
complex
and
emotional
spheres
of
existence
at
the
same
time
a
naturalism
extended
impartially
over
moral
facts
brings
home
a
lesson
of
tolerance
scepticism
and
independence
which
without
contradicting
epicurean
principles
would
very
much
enlarge
and
transform
epicurean
sentiment
history
would
have
opened
to
the
epicurean
poet
a
new
dimension
of
nature
and
a
more
varied
spectacle
of
folly
his
imagination
would
have
been
enriched
and
his
maxims
fortified
the
emotions
which
lucretius
associated
with
his
atoms
and
void
with
his
religious
denials
and
his
abstentions
from
action
are
emotions
necessarily
involved
in
life
they
will
exist
in
any
case
though
not
necessarily
associated
with
the
doctrines
by
which
this
poet
sought
to
clarify
them
they
will
remain
standing
whatever
mechanism
we
put
in
the
place
of
that
which
he
believed
in
that
is
if
we
are
serious
and
not
trying
to
escape
from
the
facts
rather
than
to
explain
them
if
the
ideas
embodied
in
a
philosophy
represent
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
facts
and
a
mature
sentiment
in
the
presence
of
them
any
new
ideas
adopted
instead
will
have
to
acquire
the
same
values
and
nothing
will
be
changed
morally
except
the
language
or
euphony
of
the
mind
of
course
one
theory
of
the
world
must
be
true
and
the
rest
false
at
least
if
the
categories
of
any
theory
are
applicable
to
reality
but
the
true
theory
like
the
false
resides
in
imagination
and
the
truth
of
it
which
the
poet
grasps
is
its
truth
to
life
if
there
are
no
atoms
at
least
there
must
be
habits
of
nature
or
laws
of
evolution
or
dialectics
of
progress
or
decrees
of
providence
or
intrusions
of
chance
and
before
these
equally
external
and
groundless
powers
we
must
bow
as
lucretius
bowed
to
his
atoms
it
will
always
be
important
and
inevitable
to
recognize
external
something
that
generates
or
surrounds
us
and
perhaps
the
only
difference
between
materialism
and
other
systems
in
this
respect
is
that
materialism
has
studied
more
scrupulously
the
detail
and
method
of
our
dependence
similarly
even
if
lucretius
was
wrong
and
the
soul
is
immortal
it
is
nevertheless
steadily
changing
its
interests
and
its
possessions
our
lives
are
mortal
if
our
soul
is
not
and
the
sentiment
which
reconciled
lucretius
to
death
is
as
much
needed
if
we
are
to
face
many
deaths
as
if
we
are
to
face
only
one
the
gradual
losing
of
what
we
have
been
and
are
emerson
says
losing
is
true
dying
is
lordly
maris
his
slow
but
sure
reclining
by
star
his
world
the
maxim
of
lucretius
that
nothing
arises
save
by
the
death
of
something
else
meets
us
still
in
our
crawling
immortality
and
his
art
of
accepting
and
enjoying
what
the
conditions
of
our
being
afford
also
has
a
perennial
application
dante
the
poet
of
faith
will
tell
us
that
we
must
find
our
peace
in
the
will
that
gives
us
our
limited
portion
goethe
the
poet
of
romantic
experience
will
tell
us
that
we
must
renounce
renounce
perpetually
thus
wisdom
clothes
the
same
moral
truths
in
many
cosmic
parables
the
doctrines
of
philosophers
disagree
where
they
are
literal
and
arbitrary
mere
guesses
about
the
unknown
but
they
agree
or
complete
one
another
where
they
are
expressive
or
symbolic
thoughts
wrung
by
experience
from
the
hearts
of
poets
then
all
philosophies
alike
are
ways
of
meeting
and
recording
the
same
flux
of
images
the
same
vicissitudes

good
and
evil

for

the
general
subject
is
immortality
but
in
a
pause
in
the
argument
socrates
says
in
my
youth
i
heard
some
one
reading
as
he
said
from
a
book
of
anaxagoras
that
reason
was
the
disposer
and
cause
of
all
and
i
was
delighted
at
this
notion
which
appeared
quite
admirable
and
i
said
to
myself
reason
is
the
disposer
reason
will
dispose
all
for
the
best
and
put
each
particular
in
the
best
place
and
i
argued
that
if
any
desired
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
generation
or
destruction
or
existence
of
anything
he
must
find
out
what
was
best
for
that
thing
and
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
i
had
found
in
anaxagoras
a
teacher
of
the
causes
of
existence
such
as
i
desired
and
i
imagined
that
he
would
tell
me
first
whether
the
earth
is
flat
or
round
and
whichever
was
true
he
would
proceed
to
show
the
nature
of
the
best
and
show
that
this
was
best
and
if
he
said
that
the
earth
was
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
he
would
further
explain
that
this
position
was
the
best
and
i
should
be
satisfied
with
the
explanation
given
and
not
want
any
other
sort
of
cause
for
i
could
not
imagine
that
when
he
spoke
of
reason
as
the
disposer
of
things
he
would
give
any
other
account
of
their
being
except
that
this
was
best
these
hopes
i
would
not
have
sold
for
a
large
sum
of
money
and
i
seized
the
books
and
read
them
as
fast
as
i
could
in
my
eagerness
to
know
the
better
and
the
worse
what
expectations
i
had
formed
and
how
grievously
was
i
disappointed
as
i
proceeded
i
found
my
philosopher
altogether
forsaking
reason
or
any
other
principle
of
order
but
having
recourse
to
air
and
ether
and
water
and
other
eccentricities
thus
one
man
makes
a
vortex
all
round
and
steadies
the
earth
by
the
heaven
another
gives
the
air
as
a
support
to
the
earth
which
is
a
sort
of
broad
trough
any
power
which
in
arranging
them
as
they
are
arranges
them
for
the
best
never
enters
into
their
minds
and
instead
of
finding
any
superior
strength
in
it
they
rather
expect
to
discover
another
atlas
of
the
world
who
is
stronger
and
more
everlasting
and
more
containing
than
the
good
of
the
obligatory
and
containing
power
of
the
good
they
think
nothing
and
yet
this
is
the
principle
which
i
would
fain
learn
if
anyone
would
teach
me
here
we
have
the
programme
of
a
new
philosophy
things
are
to
be
understood
by
their
uses
or
purposes
not
by
their
elements
or
antecedents
as
the
fact
that
socrates
sits
in
his
prison
when
he
might
have
escaped
to
euboea
is
to
be
understood
by
his
allegiance
to
his
notion
of
what
is
best
of
his
duty
to
himself
and
to
his
country
and
not
by
the
composition
of
his
bones
and
muscles
such
reasons
as
we
give
for
our
actions
such
grounds
as
might
move
the
public
assembly
to
decree
this
or
that
are
to
be
given
in
explanation
of
the
order
of
nature
the
world
is
a
work
of
reason
it
must
be
interpreted
as
we
interpret
the
actions
of
a
man
by
its
motives
and
these
motives
we
must
guess
not
by
a
fanciful
dramatic
mythology
such
as
the
poets
of
old
had
invented
but
by
a
conscientious
study
of
the
better
and
the
worse
in
the
conduct
of
our
own
lives
for
instance
the
highest
occupation
according
to
plato
is
the
study
of
philosophy
but
this
would
not
be
possible
for
man
if
he
had
to
be
continually
feeding
like
a
grazing
animal
with
its
nose
to
the
ground
now
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
eating
all
the
time
long
intestines
are
useful
therefore
the
cause
of
long
intestines
is
the
study
of
philosophy
again
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
are
in
the
front
of
the
head
because
says
plato
the
front
is
the
nobler
side
as
if
the
back
would
not
have
been
the
nobler
side
and
the
front
side
had
the
eyes
nose
and
mouth
been
there
this
method
is
what
molière
ridicules
in
malade
when
the
chorus
sings
that
opium
puts
people
to
sleep
because
it
has
a
dormitive
virtue
the
nature
of
which
is
to
make
the
senses
slumber
all
this
is
ridiculous
physics
enough
but
plato
knew
though
he
forgot
sometimes
that
his
physics
were
playful
what
it
is
important
for
us
now
to
remember
is
rather
that
under
this
childish
or
metaphorical
physics
there
is
a
serious
morality
after
all
the
of
opium
is
that
it
is
a
narcotic
no
matter
why
physically
it
is
one
the
of
the
body
the
mind
whatever
the
origin
of
the
body
may
be
and
it
seems
to
dignify
and
vindicate
these
uses
to
say
that
they
are
the
causes
of
the
organs
that
make
them
possible
what
is
true
of
particular
organs
or
substances
is
true
of
the
whole
frame
of
nature
its
is
to
serve
the
good
to
make
life
happiness
and
virtue
possible
therefore
speaking
in
parables
plato
says
with
his
whole
school
discover
the
right
principle
of
action
and
you
will
have
discovered
the
ruling
force
in
the
universe
evoke
in
your
rapt
aspiration
the
essence
of
a
supreme
good
and
you
will
have
understood
why
the
spheres
revolve
why
the
earth
is
fertile
and
why
mankind
suffers
and
exists
observation
must
yield
to
dialectic
political
art
must
yield
to
aspiration
it
took
many
hundred
years
for
the
revolution
to
work
itself
out
plato
had
a
prophetic
genius
and
looked
away
from
what
he
was
for
he
was
a
greek
to
what
mankind
was
to
become
in
the
next
cycle
of
civilization
in
dante
the
revolution
is
complete
not
merely
intellectually
for
it
had
been
completed
intellectually
long
before
in
the
neoplatonists
and
the
fathers
of
the
church
but
complete
morally
and
poetically
in
that
all
the
habits
of
the
mind
and
all
the
sanctions
of
public
life
had
been
assimilated
to
it
there
had
been
time
to
reinterpret
everything
obliterating
the
natural
lines
of
cleavage
in
the
world
and
substituting
moral
lines
of
cleavage
for
them
nature
was
a
compound
of
ideal
purposes
and
inert
matter
life
was
a
conflict
between
sin
and
grace
the
environment
was
a
between
a
host
of
angels
and
a
legion
of
demons
the
better
and
the
worse
had
actually
become
as
socrates
desired
the
sole
principles
of
understanding
having
become
socratic
the
thinking
part
of
mankind
devoted
all
its
energies
henceforward
to
defining
good
and
evil
in
all
their
grades
and
in
their
ultimate
essence
a
task
which
dante
brings
to
a
perfect
conclusion
so
earnestly
and
exclusively
did
they
speculate
about
moral
distinctions
that
they
saw
them
in
almost
visible
shapes
as
plato
had
seen
his
ideas
they
materialized
the
terms
of
their
moral
philosophy
into
existing
objects
and
powers
the
highest
good
in
plato
still
chiefly
a
political
ideal
the
aim
of
policy
and
art
became
god
the
creator
of
the
world
the
various
stages
or
elements
of
perfection
became
persons
in
the
godhead
or
angelic
intelligences
or
aerial
demons
or
lower
types
of
the
animal
soul
evil
was
identified
with
matter
the
various
stages
of
imperfection
were
ascribed
to
the
grossness
of
various
bodies
which
weighted
and
smothered
the
spark
of
divinity
that
animated
them
this
spark
however
might
be
released
then
it
would
fly
up
again
to
its
parent
fire
and
a
soul
would
be
saved
this
philosophy
was
not
a
serious
description
of
nature
or
evolution
but
it
was
a
serious
judgement
upon
them
the
good
the
better
the
best
had
been
discerned
and
a
mythical
bevy
of
powers
symbolizing
these
degrees
of
excellence
had
been
first
talked
of
and
then
believed
in
myth
when
another
man
has
invented
it
can
pass
for
history
and
when
this
man
is
a
plato
and
has
lived
long
ago
it
can
pass
for
revelation
in
this
way
moral
values
came
to
be
regarded
as
forces
working
in
nature
but
if
they
worked
in
nature
which
was
a
compound
of
evil
matter
and
perfect
form
they
must
exist
outside
for
the
ideal
of
excellence
beckons
from
afar
it
is
what
we
pine
for
and
are
not
the
forces
that
worked
in
nature
were
accordingly
supernatural
virtues
dominations
and
powers
each
natural
thing
had
its
supernatural
incubus
a
guardian
angel
or
a
devil
that
possessed
it
the
supernatural
that
is
something
moral
or
ideal
regarded
as
a
power
and
an
existence
was
all
about
us
everything
in
the
world
was
an
effect
of
something
beyond
the
world
everything
in
life
was
a
step
to
something
beyond
life
into
this
system
christianity
fitted
easily
it
enriched
it
by
adding
miraculous
history
to
symbolic
cosmology
the
platonists
had
conceived
a
cosmos
in
which
there
were
higher
and
lower
beings
marshalled
in
concentric
circles
around
this
vile
but
pivotal
lump
of
earth
the
christians
supplied
a
dramatic
action
for
which
that
stage
seemed
admirably
fitted
a
story
in
which
the
whole
human
race
or
the
single
soul
passed
successively
through
these
higher
and
lower
stages
there
had
been
a
fall
and
there
might
be
a
salvation
in
a
sense
even
this
conception
of
descent
from
the
good
and
ascent
towards
it
again
was
platonic
according
to
the
platonists
the
good
eternally
shed
its
vital
influence
like
light
and
received
though
unawares
and
without
increase
of
excellence
to
itself
reflected
rays
that
in
the
form
of
love
and
thought
reverted
to
it
from
the
ends
of
the
universe
but
according
to
the
platonist
this
radiation
of
life
and
focusing
of
aspiration
were
both
perpetual
the
double
movement
was
eternal
the
history
of
the
world
was
monotonous
or
rather
the
world
had
no
significant
history
but
only
a
movement
like
that
of
a
fountain
playing
for
ever
or
like
the
circulation
of
water
that
is
always
falling
from
the
clouds
in
rain
and
always
rising
again
in
vapour
this
fall
or
emanation
of
the
world
from
the
deity
was
the
origin
of
evil
for
the
platonists
evil
consisted
merely
infinitude
materiality
or
otherness
from
god
if
anything
besides
god
was
to
exist
it
had
to
be
imperfect
instability
and
conflict
were
essential
to
finitude
and
to
existence
salvation
on
the
other
hand
was
the
return
current
of
aspiration
on
the
part
of
the
creature
to
revert
to
its
source
an
aspiration
which
was
expressed
in
various
types
of
being
fixed
in
the
eternal
types
which
led
up
like
the
steps
of
a
temple
to
the
ineffable
good
at
the
top
in
the
christian
system
this
cosmic
circulation
became
only
a
figure
or
symbol
expressing
the
true
creation
the
true
fall
and
the
true
salvation
all
three
being
really
episodes
in
a
historical
drama
occurring
only
once
the
material
world
was
only
a
scene
a
designed
expressly
to
be
appropriate
for
the
play
and
this
play
was
the
history
of
mankind
especially
of
israel
and
of
the
church
the
persons
and
events
of
this
history
had
a
philosophic
import
each
played
some
part
in
a
providential
plan
each
illustrated
creation
sin
and
salvation
in
some
degree
and
on
some
particular
level
the
jews
had
never
felt
uncomfortable
at
being
material
even
in
the
other
world
they
hoped
to
remain
so
and
their
immortality
was
a
resurrection
of
the
flesh
it
did
not
seem
plausible
to
them
that
this
excellent
frame
of
things
should
be
nothing
but
a
faint
troubled
and
unintended
echo
of
the
good
on
the
contrary
they
thought
this
world
so
good
intrinsically
that
they
were
sure
god
must
have
made
it
expressly
and
not
by
an
unconscious
effluence
of
his
virtue
as
the
platonists
had
believed
their
wonder
at
the
power
and
ingenuity
of
the
deity
reached
its
maximum
when
they
thought
of
him
as
the
cunning
contriver
of
nature
and
of
themselves
nevertheless
the
work
seemed
to
show
some
imperfections
indeed
its
moral
excellence
was
potential
rather
than
actual
a
suggestion
of
what
might
be
rather
than
an
accomplished
fact
and
so
to
explain
the
unexpected
flaws
in
a
creation
which
they
thought
essentially
good
they
put
back
at
the
beginning
of
things
an
experience
they
had
daily
in
the
present
namely
that
trouble
springs
from
bad
conduct
the
jews
were
intent
watchers
of
fortune
and
of
its
vicissitudes
the
careers
of
men
were
their
meditation
by
day
and
by
night
and
it
takes
little
attention
to
perceive
that
frivolity
indifference
knavery
and
debauchery
do
not
make
for
in
this
world
and
like
other
peoples
the
ancient
jews
had
a
pathetic
admiration
for
safety
and
plenty
how
little
they
must
have
known
these
things
to
think
of
them
so
rapturously
and
so
poetically
not
merely
their
personal
prudence
but
their
corporate
and
religious
zeal
made
them
abhor
that
bad
conduct
which
defeated
prosperity
it
was
not
mere
folly
but
wickedness
and
the
abomination
of
desolation
with
the
lessons
of
conduct
continually
in
mind
they
framed
the
theory
that
all
suffering
and
even
death
were
the
wages
of
sin
finally
they
went
so
far
as
to
attribute
evil
in
all
creation
to
the
casual
sin
of
a
first
man
and
to
the
taint
of
it
transmitted
to
his
descendants
thus
passing
over
the
suffering
and
death
of
all
creatures
that
are
not
human
with
an
indifference
that
would
have
astonished
the
hindoos
the
imperfection
of
things
in
the
hebraic
view
was
due
to
accidents
in
their
operation
not
as
in
the
platonic
view
to
their
essential
separation
from
their
source
and
their
end
it
is
in
harmony
with
this
that
salvation
too
should
come
by
virtue
of
some
special
act
like
the
incarnation
or
death
of
christ
just
so
the
jews
had
conceived
salvation
as
a
revival
of
their
national
existence
and
greatness
to
be
brought
about
by
the
patience
and
fidelity
of
the
elect
with
tremendous
miracles
supervening
to
reward
these
virtues
thus
their
conception
of
the
fall
and
of
the
redemption
was
historical
and
this
was
a
great
advantage
to
a
man
of
imagination
inheriting
their
system
for
the
personages
and
the
miracles
that
figured
in
their
sacred
histories
afforded
a
rich
subject
for
fancy
to
work
upon
and
for
the
arts
to
depict
the
patriarchs
from
adam
down
the
kings
and
prophets
the
creation
eden
the
deluge
the
deliverance
out
of
egypt
the
thunders
and
the
law
of
sinai
the
temple
the
exile
all
this
and
much
more
that
fills
the
bible
was
a
rich
fund
a
familiar
tradition
living
in
the
church
on
which
dante
could
draw
as
he
drew
at
the
same
time
from
the
parallel
classic
tradition
which
he
also
inherited
to
lend
all
these
biblical
persons
and
incidents
a
philosophical
dignity
he
had
only
to
fit
them
as
the
fathers
of
the
church
had
done
into
the
neoplatonic
cosmology
or
as
the
doctors
of
his
own
time
were
doing
into
the
aristotelian
ethics
so
interpreted
sacred
history
acquired
for
the
philosopher
a
new
importance
besides
that
which
it
had
seemed
to
have
to
israel
in
exile
or
to
the
christian
soul
conscious
of
sin
every
episode
became
the
symbol
for
some
moral
state
or
some
moral
principle
every
preacher
in
christendom
as
he
repeated
his
homily
on
the
gospel
of
the
day
was
invited
to
rear
a
structure
of
spiritual
interpretations
upon
the
literal
sense
of
the
narrative
which
nevertheless
he
was
always
to
hold
and
preserve
as
a
foundation
for
the
others
in
a
world
made
by
god
for
the
illustration
of
his
glory
things
and
events
though
real
must
be
also
symbolical
for
there
is
intention
and
propriety
behind
them
the
creation
the
deluge
the
incarnation
crucifixion
and
resurrection
of
christ
the
coming
of
the
holy
ghost
with
flames
of
fire
and
the
gift
of
tongues
were
all
historical
facts
the
church
was
heir
to
the
chosen
people
it
was
an
historic
and
political
institution
with
a
destiny
in
this
world
in
which
all
her
children
should
share
and
for
which
they
should
fight
at
the
same
time
all
those
facts
were
mysteries
and
sacraments
for
the
private
soul
they
were
channels
for
the
same
moral
graces
that
were
embodied
in
the
order
of
the
heavenly
spheres
and
in
the
types
of
moral
life
on
earth
thus
the
hebrew
tradition
brought
to
dante
mind
the
consciousness
of
a
providential
history
a
great
earthly
task
to
be
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
and
a
great
hope
the
greek
tradition
brought
him
natural
and
moral
philosophy
these
contributions
joined
together
had
made
christian
theology
although
this
theology
was
the
guide
to
dante
imagination
and
his
general
theme
yet
it
was
not
his
only
interest
or
rather
he
put
into
the
framework
of
orthodox
theology
theories
and
visions
of
his
own
fusing
all
into
one
moral
unity
and
one
poetical
enthusiasm
the
fusion
was
perfect
between
the
personal
and
the
traditional
elements
he
threw
politics
and
love
into
the
and
they
too
lost
their
impurities
and
were
refined
into
a
philosophic
religion
theology
became
to
his
mind
the
guardian
of
patriotism
and
in
a
strangely
literal
sense
the
angel
of
love
the
political
theory
of
dante
is
a
sublime
and
largely
original
one
it
suffers
only
from
its
extreme
ideality
which
makes
it
inapplicable
and
has
caused
it
to
be
studied
less
than
it
deserves
a
man
country
in
the
modern
sense
is
something
that
arose
yesterday
that
is
constantly
changing
its
limits
and
its
ideals
it
is
something
that
can
not
last
for
ever
it
is
the
product
of
geographical
and
historical
accidents
the
diversities
between
our
different
nations
are
irrational
each
of
them
has
the
same
right
or
want
of
right
to
its
peculiarities
a
man
who
is
just
and
reasonable
must
nowadays
so
far
as
his
imagination
permits
share
the
patriotism
of
the
rivals
and
enemies
of
his
country
a
patriotism
as
inevitable
and
pathetic
as
his
own
nationality
being
an
irrational
accident
like
sex
or
complexion
a
man
allegiance
to
his
country
must
be
conditional
at
least
if
he
is
a
philosopher
his
patriotism
has
to
be
subordinated
to
rational
allegiance
to
such
things
as
justice
and
humanity
very
different
was
the
situation
in
dante
case
for
him
the
love
of
country
could
be
something
absolute
and
at
the
same
time
something
reasonable
deliberate
and
moral
what
he
found
claiming
his
allegiance
was
a
political
body
quite
ideal
providential
and
universal
this
political
body
had
two
heads
like
the
heraldic
eagle
the
pope
and
the
emperor
both
were
by
right
universal
potentates
both
should
have
their
seat
in
rome
and
both
should
direct
their
government
to
the
same
end
although
by
different
means
and
in
different
spheres
the
pope
should
watch
over
the
faith
and
discipline
of
the
church
he
should
bear
witness
in
all
lands
and
ages
to
the
fact
that
life
on
earth
was
merely
a
preliminary
to
existence
in
the
other
world
and
should
be
a
preparation
for
that
the
emperor
on
the
other
hand
should
guard
peace
and
justice
everywhere
leaving
to
free
cities
or
princes
the
regulation
of
local
affairs
these
two
powers
had
been
established
by
god
through
special
miracles
and
commissions
an
evident
providential
design
culminating
in
them
ran
through
all
history
to
betray
or
resist
these
divine
rights
or
to
confound
them
was
accordingly
a
sin
of
the
first
magnitude
the
evils
from
which
society
suffered
were
the
consequence
of
such
transgressions
the
pope
had
acquired
temporal
power
which
was
alien
to
his
purely
spiritual
office
besides
he
had
become
a
tool
of
the
french
king
who
was
what
no
king
should
be
at
war
with
the
emperor
and
rebellious
against
the
supreme
imperial
authority
indeed
the
pope
had
actually
been
seen
to
abandon
rome
for
avignon
an
act
which
was
a
sort
of
satanic
sacrament
the
outward
sign
of
an
inward
disgrace
the
emperor
in
his
turn
had
forgotten
that
he
was
king
of
the
romans
and
caesar
and
was
fond
of
loitering
in
his
native
germany
among
its
forests
and
princelings
as
if
the
whole
world
were
not
by
right
his
country
and
the
object
of
his
solicitude
and
here
the
larger
theoretical
patriotism
of
dante
as
a
catholic
and
a
roman
passed
into
his
narrower
and
actual
patriotism
as
a
florentine
had
florence
been
true
to
its
duties
and
worthy
of
its
privileges
under
the
double
authority
of
the
church
and
the
empire
florence
was
a
roman
colony
had
it
maintained
the
purity
of
its
roman
stock
and
a
roman
simplicity
and
austerity
in
its
laws
alas
etruscan
immigrants
had
contaminated
its
blood
and
this
taint
was
responsible
dante
thought
for
the
prevalent
corruption
of
manners
all
that
has
made
florence
great
in
the
history
of
the
world
was
then
only
just
beginning
its
industry
refinements
arts
and
literature
but
to
dante
that
budding
age
seemed
one
of
decadence
and
moral
ruin
he
makes
his
ancestor
the
crusader
cacciaguida
praise
the
time
when
the
narrow
circuit
of
the
walls
held
only
of
its
later
inhabitants
then
the
city
abided
in
peace
sober
and
chaste
the
women
plied
the
distaff
or
rocked
the
cradle
and
prattled
to
their
children
of
the
heroic
legends
of
troy
fiesole
and
rome
a
woman
could
turn
from
her
glass
with
her
face
unpainted
she
wore
no
girdle
far
more
deserving
of
admiration
than
her
own
person
the
birth
of
a
daughter
did
not
frighten
a
good
burgher
her
dowry
would
not
have
to
be
excessive
nor
her
marriage
premature
no
houses
were
empty
their
masters
being
in
exile
none
were
disgraced
by
unmentionable
orgies
this
was
not
all
for
if
luxury
was
a
great
curse
to
florence
faction
was
a
greater
florence
an
imperial
city
far
from
assisting
in
the
restitution
of
the
emperors
to
their
universal
rights
had
fought
against
them
traitorously
in
alliance
with
the
french
invader
and
the
usurping
pontiff
it
had
thus
undermined
the
only
possible
foundation
of
its
own
peace
and
dignity
these
were
the
theoretical
sorrows
that
loomed
behind
the
personal
sorrows
of
dante
in
his
poverty
and
exile
they
helped
him
to
pour
forth
the
intense
bitterness
of
his
heart
with
the
breath
of
prophetic
invective
they
made
his
hatred
of
the
actual
popes
and
of
the
actual
florence
so
much
fervid
zeal
for
what
the
popes
and
florence
ought
to
have
been
his
political
passions
and
political
hopes
were
fused
with
a
sublime
political
ideal
that
fusion
sublimated
them
and
made
it
possible
for
the
expression
of
them
to
rise
into
poetry
here
is
one
iron
string
on
which
dante
played
and
which
gave
a
tragic
strength
to
his
music
he
recorded
the
villainies
of
priests
princes
and
peoples
he
upbraided
them
for
their
infidelity
to
the
tasks
assigned
to
them
by
god
tasks
which
dante
conceived
with
a
biblical
definiteness
and
simplicity
he
lamented
the
consequences
of
this
iniquity
wasted
provinces
corrupted
cities
and
the
bodies
of
heroes
rolling
unburied
down
polluted
streams
these
vigorous
details
were
exalted
by
the
immense
significance
that
dante
infused
into
them
his
definite
ideal
quickened
his
eye
for
the
ebb
and
flow
of
things
rendered
the
experience
of
them
singly
more
poignant
and
the
vision
of
them
together
more
sustained
and
cumulative
dante
read
contemporary
italy
as
the
hebrew
prophets
read
the
signs
of
their
times
and
whatever
allowance
our
critical
judgement
may
make
for
generous
illusions
on
the
part
of
either
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
their
wholeness
of
soul
and
the
prophetic
absoluteness
of
their
judgements
made
their
hold
on
particular
facts
very
strong
and
their
sense
for
impending
weal
or
woe
quite
nor
does
it
seem
that
at
bottom
dante
political
philosophy
any
more
than
that
of
the
hebrew
prophets
missed
the
great
causes
and
the
great
aims
of
human
progress
behind
mythical
and
narrow
conceptions
of
history
he
had
a
true
sense
for
the
moral
principles
that
really
condition
our
a
better
science
need
subtract
nothing
from
the
insight
he
had
into
the
difference
between
political
good
and
evil
what
in
his
day
seemed
a
dream
that
mankind
should
be
one
great
commonwealth
is
now
obvious
to
the
idealist
the
socialist
the
merchant
science
and
trade
are
giving
in
a
very
different
form
to
be
sure
a
practical
realization
to
that
idea
and
the
other
half
of
his
theory
that
of
the
catholic
church
is
maintained
literally
by
that
church
itself
to
this
day
and
the
outsider
might
see
in
that
ideal
of
a
universal
spiritual
society
a
symbol
or
premonition
of
the
right
of
the
mind
to
freedom
from
legal
compulsions
or
of
the
common
allegiance
of
honest
minds
to
science
and
to
their
common
spiritual
heritage
and
destiny
on
the
other
hand
the
sting
of
dante
private
wrongs
like
the
enthusiasm
of
his
private
loves
lent
a
wonderful
warmth
and
clearness
to
the
great
objects
of
his
imagination
we
are
too
often
kept
from
feeling
great
things
greatly
for
want
of
power
to
assimilate
them
to
the
little
things
which
we
feel
keenly
and
sincerely
dante
had
in
this
respect
the
art
of
a
platonic
lover
he
could
enlarge
the
object
of
his
passion
and
keep
the
warmth
and
ardour
of
it
undiminished
he
had
been
banished
unjustly
exul
he
liked
to
call
himself
that
injustice
rankled
but
it
did
not
fester
in
his
heart
for
his
indignation
spread
to
all
wrong
and
thundered
against
florence
europe
and
mankind
in
that
they
were
corrupt
and
perfidious
dante
had
loved
the
memory
of
that
passion
remained
also
but
it
did
not
degenerate
into
sentimentality
for
his
adoration
passed
to
a
larger
object
and
one
less
accidental
his
love
had
been
a
spark
of
that
love
which
moves
the
sun
and
the
other
stars
he
had
known
in
that
revelation
the
secret
of
the
universe
the
spheres
the
angels
the
sciences
were
henceforth
full
of
sweetness
comfort
and
light
of
this
platonic
expansion
of
emotion
till
it
suffuses
all
that
deserves
to
kindle
it
we
have
a
wonderful
version
in
dante
this
book
on
the
surface
is
an
account
of
dante
meeting
at
the
age
of
nine
with
beatrice
a
child
even
a
little
younger
of
another
meeting
with
her
at
the
age
of
eighteen
of
an
overwhelming
mystic
passion
which
the
lover
wished
to
keep
secret
so
much
so
that
he
feigned
another
attachment
as
a
blind
of
a
consequent
estrangement
and
of
the
death
of
beatrice
whereupon
the
poet
resolved
not
to
speak
publicly
of
her
again
until
he
could
praise
her
in
such
wise
as
no
woman
had
ever
been
praised
before
this
story
is
interspersed
with
poems
of
the
most
exquisite
delicacy
both
in
sentiment
and
in
versification
they
are
dreamlike
allegorical
musical
meditations
ambiguous
in
their
veiled
meanings
but
absolutely
clear
and
perfect
in
their
artful
structure
like
a
work
of
tracery
and
stained
glass
geometrical
mystical
and
tender
a
singular
limpidity
of
accent
and
image
a
singular
naïveté
is
strangely
combined
in
these
pieces
with
scholastic
distinctions
and
a
delight
in
hiding
and
hinting
as
in
a
charade
the
learned
will
dispute
for
ever
on
the
exact
basis
and
meaning
of
these
confessions
of
dante
the
learned
are
perhaps
not
those
best
fitted
to
solve
the
problem
it
is
a
matter
for
literary
tact
and
sympathetic
imagination
it
must
be
left
to
the
delicate
intelligence
of
the
reader
if
he
has
it
and
if
he
has
not
dante
does
not
wish
to
open
his
heart
to
him
his
enigmatical
manner
is
his
protection
against
the
intrusion
of
uncongenial
minds
without
passing
beyond
the
sphere
of
learned
criticism
i
think
we
may
say
this
the
various
interpretations
in
this
matter
are
not
mutually
exclusive
symbolism
and
literalness
in
dante
time
and
in
his
practice
are
simultaneous
for
instance
in
any
history
of
mediaeval
philosophy
you
may
read
that
a
great
subject
of
dispute
in
those
days
was
the
question
whether
universal
terms
or
natures
such
as
man
or
humanity
existed
before
the
particulars
in
the
particulars
or
after
the
particulars
by
abstraction
of
what
was
common
to
them
all
now
this
matter
was
undoubtedly
much
disputed
about
but
there
is
one
comprehensive
and
orthodox
solution
which
represents
the
true
mind
of
the
age
above
the
peculiar
hobbies
or
heresies
of
individuals
this
solution
is
that
universal
terms
or
natures
exist
before
the
particulars
in
the
particulars
after
the
particulars
for
god
before
he
made
the
world
knew
how
he
intended
to
make
it
and
had
eternally
in
his
mind
the
notions
of
a
perfect
man
horse
after
which
the
particulars
were
to
be
modelled
or
to
which
in
case
of
accident
they
were
to
be
restored
either
by
the
healing
and
recuperative
force
of
nature
or
by
the
ministrations
of
grace
but
universal
terms
or
natures
existed
also
the
particulars
since
the
particulars
illustrated
them
shared
in
them
and
were
what
they
were
by
virtue
of
that
participation
nevertheless
the
universals
existed
also
after
the
particulars
for
the
discursive
mind
of
man
surveying
the
variety
of
natural
things
could
not
help
noticing
and
abstracting
the
common
types
that
often
recur
in
them
and
this
idea
in
the
human
mind
is
a
universal
term
also
to
deny
any
of
the
three
theories
and
not
to
see
their
consistency
is
to
miss
the
mediaeval
point
of
view
which
in
every
sense
of
the
word
was
catholic
just
such
a
solution
seems
to
me
natural
in
the
case
of
beatrice
we
have
it
on
independent
documentary
evidence
that
in
dante
time
there
actually
lived
in
florence
a
certain
bice
portinari
and
there
are
many
incidents
in
the
and
in
the
which
hardly
admit
of
an
allegorical
interpretation
such
as
the
death
of
beatrice
and
especially
that
of
her
father
on
which
occasion
dante
writes
a
sympathetic
poem
can
see
no
reason
why
this
lady
as
easily
as
any
other
person
should
not
have
called
forth
the
dreamful
passion
of
our
poet
that
he
had
loved
some
one
is
certain
most
people
have
and
why
should
dante
in
particular
have
found
the
language
of
love
a
natural
veil
for
his
philosophy
if
the
passion
and
the
language
of
love
had
not
been
his
the
language
of
love
is
no
doubt
usual
in
the
allegories
of
mystics
and
was
current
in
the
conventional
poetry
of
dante
time
but
mystics
themselves
are
commonly
crossed
or
potential
lovers
and
the
troubadours
harped
on
the
string
of
love
simply
because
it
was
the
most
responsive
string
in
their
own
natures
and
that
which
could
most
easily
be
made
to
vibrate
in
their
hearers
dante
was
not
less
sensitive
than
the
average
man
of
his
generation
and
if
he
followed
the
fashion
of
minstrels
and
mystics
it
was
because
he
shared
their
disposition
the
beautiful
the
unapproachable
the
divine
had
passed
before
him
in
some
visible
form
it
matters
nothing
whether
this
vision
came
once
only
and
in
the
shape
of
the
actual
beatrice
or
continuously
and
in
every
shape
through
which
a
divine
influence
may
seem
to
come
to
a
poet
no
one
would
deserve
this
name
of
poet
and
who
deserves
it
more
than
dante
if
real
sights
and
sounds
never
impressed
him
and
he
would
hardly
deserve
it
either
if
they
impressed
him
only
physically
and
for
what
they
are
in
themselves
his
sensibility
creates
his
ideal
if
to
deny
the
existence
of
an
historical
beatrice
seems
violent
and
gratuitous
it
would
be
a
much
worse
misunderstanding
not
to
perceive
that
beatrice
is
a
symbol
on
one
occasion
as
we
read
in
the
dante
found
himself
in
a
church
in
the
presence
of
beatrice
his
eyes
were
inevitably
fixed
upon
her
but
as
he
wished
to
conceal
his
profound
passion
from
the
gossiping
crowd
he
chose
another
lady
who
happened
to
stand
in
the
direct
line
of
vision
between
him
and
beatrice
and
pretended
to
be
gazing
at
her
in
reality
looking
beyond
her
to
beatrice
this
intervening
lady
donna
became
the
screen
to
his
true
love
but
his
attentions
to
her
were
so
assiduous
that
they
were
misinterpreted
beatrice
herself
observed
them
and
thinking
he
was
going
too
far
and
not
with
an
honourable
purpose
showed
her
displeasure
by
refusing
to
greet
him
as
he
passed
this
sounds
real
and
earthly
enough
but
what
is
our
surprise
when
we
read
expressly
in
the
that
the
gentile
the
screen
to
dante
true
love
is
philosophy
if
the
is
philosophy
the
gentilissima
beatrice
must
be
something
of
the
same
sort
only
nobler
she
must
be
theology
and
theology
beatrice
undoubtedly
is
her
very
name
is
played
upon
if
not
selected
to
mean
that
she
is
what
renders
blessed
what
shows
the
path
of
salvation
now
the
scene
in
the
church
becomes
an
allegory
throughout
the
young
dante
we
are
given
to
understand
was
at
heart
a
religious
and
devout
soul
looking
for
the
highest
wisdom
but
intervening
between
his
human
reason
and
revealed
truth
which
he
really
was
in
love
with
and
wished
to
win
and
to
understand
he
found
philosophy
or
as
we
should
say
science
to
science
he
gave
his
preliminary
attention
so
much
so
that
the
mysteries
of
theology
were
momentarily
obscured
in
his
mind
and
his
faith
to
his
great
sorrow
refused
to
salute
him
as
he
passed
he
had
fallen
into
materialistic
errors
he
had
interpreted
the
spots
on
the
moon
as
if
they
could
be
due
to
physical
not
to
socratic
causes
and
his
religious
philosophy
had
lost
its
warmth
even
if
his
religious
faith
had
not
actually
been
endangered
it
is
certain
then
that
beatrice
besides
being
a
woman
was
also
a
symbol
but
this
is
not
the
end
if
beatrice
is
a
symbol
for
theology
theology
itself
is
it
too
is
an
avenue
an
interpretation
the
eyes
of
beatrice
reflect
a
supernal
light
it
is
the
ineffable
vision
of
god
the
beatific
vision
that
alone
can
make
us
happy
and
be
the
reason
and
the
end
of
our
loves
and
our
pilgrimages
a
supreme
ideal
of
peace
and
perfection
which
moves
the
lover
and
which
moves
the
sky
is
more
easily
named
than
understood
in
the
last
canto
of
the
where
dante
is
attempting
to
describe
the
beatific
vision
he
says
many
times
over
that
our
notion
of
this
ideal
must
be
vague
and
inadequate
the
value
of
the
notion
to
a
poet
or
a
philosopher
does
not
lie
in
what
it
contains
positively
but
in
the
attitude
which
it
causes
him
to
assume
towards
real
experience
or
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
to
have
an
ideal
does
not
mean
so
much
to
have
any
image
in
the
fancy
any
utopia
more
or
less
articulate
but
rather
to
take
a
consistent
moral
attitude
towards
all
the
things
of
this
world
to
judge
and
coordinate
our
interests
to
establish
a
hierarchy
of
goods
and
evils
and
to
value
events
and
persons
not
by
a
casual
personal
impression
or
instinct
but
according
to
their
real
nature
and
tendency
so
understood
an
ultimate
ideal
is
no
mere
vision
of
the
philosophical
dreamer
but
a
powerful
and
passionate
force
in
the
poet
and
the
orator
it
is
the
voice
of
his
love
or
hate
of
his
hope
or
sorrow
idealizing
challenging
or
condemning
the
world
it
is
here
that
the
feverish
sensibility
of
the
young
dante
stood
him
in
good
stead
it
gave
an
unprecedented
vigour
and
clearness
to
his
moral
vision
it
made
him
the
classic
poet
of
hell
and
of
heaven
at
the
same
time
it
helped
to
make
him
an
upright
judge
a
terrible
accuser
of
the
earth
everything
and
everybody
in
his
day
and
generation
became
to
him
on
account
of
his
intense
loyalty
to
his
inward
vision
an
instance
of
divine
graciousness
or
of
devilish
perversity
doubtless
this
keenness
of
soul
was
not
wholly
due
to
the
gift
of
loving
or
to
the
discipline
of
love
it
was
due
in
part
also
to
pride
to
resentment
to
theoretical
prejudices
but
figures
like
that
of
francesca
di
rimini
and
manfred
and
the
light
and
rapture
vibrating
through
the
whole
could
hardly
have
been
evoked
by
a
merely
irritated
genius
the
background
and
the
of
everything
in
dante
is
the
d
the
genius
of
love
everybody
has
heard
that
god
is
love
and
that
love
makes
the
world
go
round
and
those
who
have
traced
this
latter
notion
back
to
its
source
in
aristotle
may
have
some
notion
of
what
it
means
it
means
as
we
saw
in
the
beginning
that
we
should
not
try
to
explain
motion
and
life
by
their
natural
antecedents
for
these
run
back
we
should
explain
motion
and
life
rather
by
their
purpose
or
end
by
that
unrealized
ideal
which
moving
and
living
things
seem
to
aspire
to
and
may
be
said
to
love
what
justifies
itself
is
not
any
fact
or
law
for
why
should
these
not
have
been
different
what
justifies
itself
is
what
is
good
what
is
as
it
ought
to
be
but
things
in
motion
aristotle
conceived
declare
as
it
were
that
they
are
not
satisfied
and
ought
to
be
in
some
different
condition
they
look
to
a
fulfilment
which
is
as
yet
ideal
this
fulfilment
if
it
included
motion
and
life
could
include
them
inwardly
only
it
would
consist
in
a
sustained
activity
never
lapsing
nor
suffering
change
such
an
activity
is
the
unchanging
goal
towards
which
life
advances
and
by
which
its
different
stages
are
measured
but
since
the
purpose
of
things
and
not
their
natural
causes
is
that
which
explains
them
we
may
call
this
eventual
activity
their
reason
for
being
it
will
be
their
unmoved
mover
but
how
we
may
ask
how
can
the
unchanging
the
ideal
the
eventual
initiate
anything
or
determine
the
disposition
and
tendency
of
what
actually
lives
and
moves
the
answer
or
rather
the
impossibility
of
giving
an
answer
may
be
expressed
in
a
single
word
magic
it
is
magic
when
a
good
or
interesting
result
because
it
would
prove
good
or
interesting
is
credited
with
marshalling
the
conditions
and
evoking
the
beings
that
are
to
realize
it
it
is
natural
that
i
should
be
hungry
and
natural
that
there
should
be
things
suitable
for
me
to
eat
for
otherwise
i
should
not
be
hungry
long
but
if
my
hunger
in
case
it
is
sharp
enough
should
be
able
of
itself
to
produce
the
food
it
calls
for
that
would
be
magic
nature
would
be
evoked
by
the
incantations
of
the
will
i
do
not
forget
that
aristotle
with
dante
after
him
asserts
that
the
goal
of
life
is
a
separate
being
already
existing
namely
the
mind
of
god
eternally
realizing
what
the
world
aspires
to
the
influence
of
this
mind
however
upon
the
world
is
no
less
magical
than
would
be
that
of
a
ideal
for
its
operation
is
admittedly
not
transitive
or
physical
it
itself
does
not
change
in
working
no
virtue
leaves
it
it
does
not
according
to
aristotle
and
plotinus
even
know
that
it
works
indeed
it
works
only
because
other
things
are
disposed
to
pursue
it
as
their
ideal
let
things
keep
this
disposition
and
they
will
pursue
and
frame
their
ideal
no
less
if
it
nowhere
has
an
actual
existence
than
if
by
chance
it
exists
elsewhere
in
its
own
person
it
works
only
in
its
capacity
of
ideal
therefore
even
if
it
exists
it
works
only
by
magic
the
matter
beneath
feels
the
spell
of
its
presence
and
catches
something
of
its
image
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
might
receive
and
reflect
tremblingly
the
light
shed
by
the
moon
the
world
accordingly
is
moved
and
vivified
in
every
fibre
by
magic
by
the
magic
of
the
goal
to
which
it
aspires
but
this
magic
on
earth
bore
the
name
of
love
the
life
of
the
world
was
a
love
produced
by
the
magic
attraction
of
a
good
it
has
never
possessed
and
so
long
as
it
remains
a
world
is
incapable
of
possessing
actual
things
were
only
suggestions
of
what
the
elements
in
that
ulterior
existence
ought
to
be
they
were
mere
symbols
the
acorn
was
a
mere
prophecy
an
existing
symbol
for
the
ideal
oak
because
when
the
acorn
falls
into
good
ground
it
will
be
corrupted
but
the
idea
of
the
oak
will
arise
and
be
manifested
in
its
place
the
acorn
was
a
sort
of
reliquary
in
which
the
miraculous
power
of
the
idea
was
somehow
enshrined
in
the
vulgar
attribution
of
causes
we
like
anaxagoras
resemble
a
superstitious
who
should
forget
that
the
intercession
and
merits
of
the
saint
really
work
the
miracle
and
should
attribute
it
instead
to
the
saint
bones
and
garments
in
their
material
capacity
similarly
we
should
attribute
the
power
which
things
exerted
over
us
not
to
the
rarer
or
denser
substance
but
to
the
eternal
ideas
that
they
existed
by
expressing
and
existed
to
express
things
merely
localized
like
the
saint
relics
the
influences
which
flowed
to
us
from
above
in
the
world
of
values
they
were
mere
symbols
accidental
channels
for
divine
energy
and
since
divine
energy
by
its
magic
assimilation
of
matter
had
created
these
things
in
order
to
express
itself
they
were
symbols
altogether
not
merely
in
their
use
but
in
their
origin
and
nature
a
mind
persuaded
that
it
lives
among
things
that
like
words
are
essentially
significant
and
that
what
they
signify
is
the
magic
attraction
called
love
which
draws
all
things
after
it
is
a
mind
poetic
in
its
intuition
even
if
its
language
be
prose
the
science
and
philosophy
of
dante
did
not
have
to
be
put
into
verse
in
order
to
become
poetry
they
were
poetry
fundamentally
and
in
their
essence
when
plato
and
aristotle
following
the
momentous
precept
of
socrates
decreed
that
observation
of
nature
should
stop
and
a
moral
interpretation
of
nature
should
begin
they
launched
into
the
world
a
new
mythology
to
take
the
place
of
the
homeric
one
which
was
losing
its
authority
the
power
the
poets
had
lost
of
producing
illusion
was
possessed
by
these
philosophers
in
a
high
degree
and
no
one
was
ever
more
thoroughly
under
their
spell
than
dante
he
became
to
platonism
and
christianity
what
homer
had
been
to
paganism
and
if
platonism
and
christianity
like
paganism
should
ever
cease
to
be
defended
scientifically
dante
will
keep
the
poetry
and
wisdom
of
them
alive
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
later
generations
will
envy
more
than
they
will
despise
his
philosophy
when
the
absurd
controversies
and
factious
passions
that
in
some
measure
obscure
the
nature
of
this
system
have
completely
passed
away
no
one
will
think
of
reproaching
dante
with
his
bad
science
and
bad
history
and
minute
theology
these
will
not
seem
blemishes
in
his
poetry
but
integral
parts
of
it
a
thousand
years
after
homer
alexandrian
critics
were
expounding
his
charming
myths
as
if
they
were
a
revealed
treatise
of
physics
and
morals
a
thousand
years
after
dante
we
may
hope
that
his
conscientious
vision
of
the
universe
where
all
is
love
magic
and
symbolism
may
charm
mankind
exclusively
as
poetry
so
conceived
the
marks
high
noon
in
that
long
of
which
plato
dialogues
mark
the
beginning
a
pause
of
two
thousand
years
in
the
work
of
political
reason
during
which
the
moral
imagination
spun
out
of
itself
an
allegorical
philosophy
as
a
boy
kept
at
home
during
a
rainy
day
with
books
too
hard
and
literal
for
his
years
might
spin
his
own
romance
out
of
his
father
histories
and
might
define
with
infantile
precision
his
ideal
battles
and
kingdoms
the
middle
age
saw
the
good
in
a
vision
it
is
for
the
new
age
to
translate
those
delightful
symbols
into
the
purposes
of
manhood
in
a
letter
which
tradition
assigns
to
dante
addressed
to
his
protector
cangrande
della
scala
lord
of
verona
and
vicenza
are
these
words
about
the
the
subject
of
the
whole
work
taken
merely
in
its
literal
sense
is
the
state
of
souls
after
death
considered
simply
as
a
fact
but
if
the
work
is
understood
in
its
allegorical
intention
the
subject
of
it
is
man
according
as
by
his
deserts
and
demerits
in
the
use
of
his
he
is
justly
open
to
rewards
and
punishments
this
by
no
means
exhausts
however
the
significations
which
we
may
look
for
in
a
work
of
dante
how
many
these
may
be
is
pointed
out
to
us
in
the
same
letter
and
illustrated
by
the
beginning
of
the
one
hundred
and
fourteenth
psalm
when
israel
went
out
of
egypt
the
house
of
jacob
from
a
people
of
strange
language
judah
was
his
sanctuary
and
israel
his
dominion
here
dante
tells
us
if
we
look
to
the
only
what
is
conveyed
to
us
is
the
deliverance
of
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
in
the
time
of
moses
if
we
look
to
the
of
it
what
is
signified
is
our
redemption
accomplished
through
christ
if
we
consider
the
what
is
signified
is
the
conversion
of
the
soul
from
her
present
grief
and
wretchedness
to
a
state
of
grace
and
if
we
consider
the
that
is
the
revelation
contained
concerning
our
highest
destiny
what
is
signified
is
the
passing
of
the
sanctified
soul
from
the
bondage
of
earthly
corruption
to
the
freedom
of
everlasting
glory
when
people
brooded
so
much
over
a
simple
text
as
to
find
all
these
meanings
in
it
we
may
expect
that
their
own
works
when
meant
to
be
profound
should
have
stage
above
stage
of
allegorical
application
so
in
the
first
canto
of
the
we
find
a
lion
that
keeps
dante
from
approaching
a
delectable
mountain
and
this
lion
besides
what
he
is
in
the
landscape
of
the
poem
is
a
symbol
for
pride
or
power
in
general
for
the
king
of
france
in
particular
and
for
whatever
political
ambitions
in
dante
personal
life
may
have
robbed
him
of
happiness
or
distracted
him
from
faith
and
from
piety
thus
throughout
the
meaning
and
meaning
lurk
beneath
the
luminous
pictures
and
the
poem
besides
being
a
description
of
the
other
world
and
of
the
rewards
and
punishment
meted
out
to
souls
is
a
dramatic
view
of
human
passions
in
this
life
a
history
of
italy
and
of
the
world
a
theory
of
church
and
state
the
autobiography
of
an
exile
and
the
confessions
of
a
christian
and
of
a
lover
conscious
of
his
sins
and
of
the
miracle
of
divine
grace
that
intervenes
to
save
him
the
of
the
is
accordingly
the
moral
universe
in
all
its
levels
romantic
political
religious
to
present
these
moral
facts
in
a
graphic
way
the
poet
performed
a
double
work
of
imagination
first
he
chose
some
historical
personage
that
might
plausibly
illustrate
each
condition
of
the
soul
then
he
pictured
this
person
in
some
characteristic
and
symbolic
attitude
of
mind
and
of
body
and
in
an
appropriate
symbolic
environment
to
give
material
embodiment
to
moral
ideas
by
such
a
method
would
nowadays
be
very
artificial
and
perhaps
impossible
but
in
dante
time
everything
was
favourable
to
the
attempt
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
goods
and
evils
as
functions
of
a
natural
life
sparks
struck
out
in
the
chance
shock
of
men
with
things
or
with
one
another
for
dante
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
moral
distinctions
might
be
discerned
not
merely
as
they
arise
incidentally
in
human
experience
but
also
and
more
genuinely
as
they
are
displayed
in
the
order
of
creation
the
creator
himself
was
a
poet
producing
allegories
the
material
world
was
a
parable
which
he
had
built
out
in
space
and
ordered
to
be
enacted
history
was
a
great
charade
the
symbols
of
earthly
poets
are
words
or
images
the
symbols
of
the
divine
poet
were
natural
things
and
the
fortunes
of
men
they
had
been
devised
for
a
purpose
and
this
purpose
as
the
koran
too
declares
had
been
precisely
to
show
forth
the
great
difference
there
is
in
god
sight
between
good
and
evil
in
platonic
cosmology
the
concentric
spheres
were
bodies
formed
and
animated
by
intelligences
of
various
orders
the
nobler
an
intelligence
the
more
swift
and
outward
or
higher
was
the
sphere
it
moved
whence
the
identification
of
higher
with
better
which
survives
absurdly
to
this
day
and
while
dante
could
not
attribute
literal
truth
to
his
fancies
about
hell
purgatory
and
heaven
he
believed
that
an
actual
heaven
purgatory
and
hell
had
been
fashioned
by
god
on
purpose
to
receive
souls
of
varying
deserts
and
complexion
so
that
while
the
poet
imagination
unless
it
reechoed
divine
revelation
was
only
human
and
not
prophetic
yet
it
was
a
genuine
and
plausible
imagination
moving
on
the
lines
of
nature
and
anticipating
such
things
as
experience
might
very
well
realize
dante
objectification
of
morality
his
art
of
giving
visible
forms
and
local
habitations
to
ideal
virtues
and
vices
was
for
him
a
thoroughly
serious
and
philosophical
exercise
god
had
created
nature
and
life
on
that
very
principle
the
method
repeated
the
magic
of
genesis
his
symbolical
imagination
mirrored
this
symbolical
world
it
was
a
sincere
anticipation
of
fact
no
mere
laboured
and
wilful
allegory
this
situation
has
a
curious
consequence
probably
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
a
classification
worked
out
by
a
systematic
moralist
guided
the
vision
of
a
great
poet
aristotle
had
distinguished
named
and
classified
the
various
virtues
with
their
opposites
but
observe
if
the
other
world
was
made
on
purpose
as
it
was
to
express
and
render
palpable
those
moral
distinctions
which
were
eternal
and
to
express
and
render
them
palpable
in
great
detail
with
all
their
possible
tints
and
varieties
and
if
aristotle
had
correctly
classified
moral
qualities
as
he
had
then
it
follows
that
aristotle
without
knowing
it
must
have
supplied
the
as
it
were
of
hell
and
of
heaven
such
was
dante
thought
with
aristotle
open
before
him
with
a
supplementary
hint
here
and
there
drawn
from
the
catechism
and
with
an
ingrained
preference
pious
and
almost
philosophic
for
the
number
three
and
its
multiples
he
needed
not
to
voyage
without
a
chart
the
most
visionary
of
subjects
life
after
death
could
be
treated
with
scientific
soberness
and
deep
sincerity
this
vision
was
to
be
no
wanton
dream
it
was
to
be
a
sober
meditation
a
philosophical
prophecy
a
probable
drama
the
most
poignant
terrible
and
consoling
of
all
possible
truths
the
good
this
was
the
fundamental
thought
of
aristotle
and
of
all
greek
ethics
the
good
is
the
end
at
which
nature
aims
the
demands
of
life
can
not
be
radically
perverse
since
they
are
the
judges
of
every
excellence
no
man
as
dante
says
could
hate
his
own
soul
he
could
not
at
once
be
and
contradict
the
voice
of
his
instincts
and
emotions
nor
could
a
man
hate
god
for
if
that
man
knew
himself
he
would
see
that
god
was
by
definition
his
natural
good
the
ultimate
goal
of
his
actual
aspirations
since
it
was
impossible
according
to
his
insight
that
our
faculties
should
be
intrinsically
evil
all
evil
had
to
arise
from
the
disorder
into
which
these
faculties
fall
their
too
great
weakness
or
strength
in
relation
to
one
another
if
the
animal
part
of
man
was
too
strong
for
his
reason
he
fell
into
incontinence
that
is
into
lust
gluttony
avarice
wrath
or
pride
incontinence
came
from
an
excessive
or
pursuit
of
something
good
of
a
part
of
what
nature
aims
at
for
food
children
property
and
character
are
natural
goods
these
sins
are
accordingly
the
most
excusable
and
the
least
odious
dante
puts
those
who
have
sinned
through
love
in
the
first
circle
of
hell
nearest
to
the
sunlight
or
in
the
topmost
round
of
purgatory
nearest
to
the
earthly
paradise
below
the
lovers
in
each
case
are
the
gluttons
where
a
northern
poet
would
have
been
obliged
to
place
his
drunkards
beneath
these
again
are
the
misers
worse
because
less
open
to
the
excuse
of
a
merely
childish
lack
of
the
disorder
of
the
faculties
may
arise
however
in
another
way
the
combative
or
spirited
element
rather
than
the
senses
may
get
out
of
hand
and
lead
to
crimes
of
violence
violence
like
incontinence
is
spontaneous
enough
in
its
personal
origin
and
would
not
be
odious
if
it
did
not
inflict
and
intend
to
inflict
harm
on
others
so
that
besides
incontinence
there
is
malice
in
it
to
others
may
arise
from
pride
because
one
loves
to
be
superior
to
them
or
from
envy
because
one
abhors
that
they
should
seem
superior
to
oneself
or
through
desire
for
vengeance
because
one
smarts
under
some
injury
sins
of
these
kinds
are
more
serious
than
those
of
foolish
incontinence
they
complicate
the
moral
world
more
they
introduce
endless
opposition
of
interests
and
perpetual
crimes
they
are
hateful
dante
feels
less
pity
for
those
who
suffer
by
them
he
remembers
the
sufferings
these
malefactors
have
themselves
caused
and
he
feels
a
sort
of
joy
in
joining
the
divine
justice
and
would
gladly
lash
them
himself
worse
still
than
violence
however
is
guile
the
sin
of
those
who
in
the
service
of
their
intemperance
or
their
malice
have
abused
the
gift
of
reason
optimi
and
to
turn
reason
the
faculty
that
establishes
order
into
a
means
of
organizing
disorder
is
a
perversity
truly
satanic
it
turns
evil
into
an
art
but
even
this
perversity
has
stages
and
dante
distinguishes
ten
sorts
of
dishonesty
or
simple
fraud
as
well
as
three
sorts
of
treachery
besides
these
positive
transgressions
there
is
a
possibility
of
general
moral
sluggishness
and
indifference
this
dante
with
his
fervid
nature
particularly
hates
he
puts
the
laodiceans
in
the
fringe
of
his
hell
within
the
gate
that
they
may
be
without
hope
but
outside
of
limbo
that
they
may
have
torments
to
endure
and
be
stung
by
wasps
and
hornets
into
a
belated
activity
to
these
vices
known
to
aristotle
the
catholic
moralist
was
obliged
to
add
two
others
original
sin
of
which
spontaneous
disbelief
is
one
consequence
and
heresy
or
misbelief
after
a
revelation
has
been
given
and
accepted
original
sin
and
the
paganism
that
goes
with
it
if
they
lead
to
nothing
worse
are
a
mere
privation
of
excellence
and
involve
in
eternity
merely
a
privation
of
joy
they
are
punished
in
limbo
there
sighs
are
heard
but
no
lamentation
and
the
only
sorrow
is
to
live
in
desire
without
hope
this
fate
is
most
appropriately
imputed
to
the
noble
and
in
the
hereafter
since
it
is
so
often
their
experience
here
dante
was
never
juster
than
in
this
stroke
heresy
on
the
other
hand
is
a
kind
of
passion
when
honest
or
a
kind
of
fraud
when
politic
and
it
is
punished
as
pride
in
fiery
tombs
or
as
faction
by
perpetual
gaping
wounds
and
horrible
mutilations
so
far
with
these
slight
additions
dante
is
following
aristotle
but
here
a
great
divergence
sets
in
if
a
pagan
poet
had
conceived
the
idea
of
illustrating
the
catalogue
of
vices
and
virtues
in
poetic
scenes
he
would
have
chosen
suitable
episodes
in
human
life
and
painted
the
typical
characters
that
figured
in
them
in
their
earthly
environment
for
pagan
morality
is
a
plant
of
earth
not
so
with
dante
his
poem
describes
this
world
merely
in
retrospect
the
foreground
is
occupied
by
the
eternal
consequences
of
what
time
had
brought
forth
these
consequences
are
new
facts
not
merely
as
for
the
rationalist
the
old
facts
conceived
in
their
truth
they
often
reverse
in
their
emotional
quality
the
events
they
represent
such
a
reversal
is
made
possible
by
the
theory
that
justice
is
partly
retributive
that
virtue
is
not
its
own
sufficient
reward
nor
vice
its
own
sufficient
punishment
according
to
this
theory
this
life
contains
a
part
of
our
experience
only
yet
determines
the
rest
the
other
life
is
a
second
experience
yet
it
does
not
contain
any
novel
adventures
it
is
determined
altogether
by
what
we
have
done
on
earth
as
the
tree
falleth
so
it
lieth
and
souls
after
death
have
no
further
initiative
the
theory
dante
adopts
mediates
between
two
earlier
views
in
so
far
as
it
is
greek
it
conceives
immortality
ideally
as
something
timeless
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
hebraic
it
conceives
of
a
new
existence
and
a
second
different
taste
of
life
dante
thinks
of
a
second
experience
but
of
one
that
is
wholly
retrospective
and
changeless
it
is
an
epilogue
which
sums
up
the
play
and
is
the
last
episode
in
it
the
purpose
of
this
epilogue
is
not
to
carry
on
the
play
indefinitely
such
a
romantic
notion
of
immortality
never
entered
dante
mind
the
purpose
of
the
epilogue
is
merely
to
vindicate
in
a
more
unmistakable
fashion
than
the
play
being
ill
acted
itself
could
do
the
excellence
of
goodness
and
the
misery
of
vice
were
this
life
all
he
thinks
the
wicked
might
laugh
if
not
wholly
happy
at
least
they
might
boast
that
their
lot
was
no
worse
than
that
of
many
good
men
nothing
would
make
an
overwhelming
difference
moral
distinctions
would
be
largely
impertinent
and
remarkably
jumbled
if
i
am
a
simple
lover
of
goodness
i
may
perhaps
put
up
with
this
situation
i
may
say
of
the
excellences
i
prize
what
wordsworth
says
of
his
lucy
there
may
be
none
to
praise
and
few
to
love
them
but
they
make
all
the
difference
to
me
dante
however
was
not
merely
a
simple
lover
of
excellence
he
was
also
a
keen
hater
of
wickedness
one
that
took
the
moral
world
tragically
and
wished
to
heighten
the
distinctions
he
felt
into
something
absolute
and
infinite
now
any
man
who
is
in
his
preferences
will
probably
say
with
mohammed
tertullian
and
calvin
that
good
is
dishonoured
if
those
who
contemn
it
can
go
and
never
repent
of
their
negligence
that
the
more
horrible
the
consequences
of
the
more
tolerable
the
presence
of
is
in
the
world
and
that
the
everlasting
shrieks
and
contortions
of
the
damned
alone
will
make
it
possible
for
the
saints
to
sit
quiet
and
be
convinced
that
there
is
perfect
harmony
in
the
universe
on
this
principle
in
the
famous
inscription
which
dante
places
over
the
gate
of
hell
we
read
that
primal
love
as
well
as
justice
and
power
established
that
primal
love
that
is
of
that
good
which
by
the
extreme
punishment
of
those
who
scorn
it
is
honoured
vindicated
and
made
to
shine
like
the
sun
the
damned
are
damned
for
the
glory
of
god
this
doctrine
i
can
not
help
thinking
is
a
great
disgrace
to
human
nature
it
shows
how
desperate
at
heart
is
the
folly
of
an
egotistic
or
anthropocentric
philosophy
this
philosophy
begins
by
assuring
us
that
everything
is
obviously
created
to
serve
our
needs
it
then
maintains
that
everything
serves
our
ideals
and
in
the
end
it
reveals
that
everything
serves
our
blind
hatreds
and
superstitious
qualms
because
my
instinct
taboos
something
the
whole
universe
with
insane
intensity
shall
taboo
it
for
ever
this
infatuation
was
inherited
by
dante
and
it
was
not
uncongenial
to
his
bitter
and
intemperate
spleen
nevertheless
he
saw
beyond
it
at
times
like
many
other
christian
seers
he
betrays
here
and
there
an
esoteric
view
of
rewards
and
punishments
which
makes
them
simply
symbols
for
the
intrinsic
quality
of
good
and
evil
ways
the
punishment
he
then
seems
to
say
is
nothing
added
it
is
what
the
passion
itself
pursues
it
is
a
fulfilment
horrifying
the
soul
that
desired
it
for
instance
spirits
newly
arrived
in
hell
require
no
devil
with
his
prong
to
drive
them
to
their
punishment
they
flit
towards
it
eagerly
of
their
own
accord
similarly
the
souls
in
purgatory
are
kept
by
their
own
will
at
the
penance
they
are
doing
no
external
force
retains
them
but
until
they
are
quite
purged
they
are
not
able
because
they
are
not
willing
to
absolve
themselves
the
whole
mountain
we
are
told
trembles
and
bursts
into
psalmody
when
any
one
frees
himself
and
reaches
heaven
is
it
too
much
of
a
gloss
to
say
that
these
souls
change
their
prison
when
they
change
their
ideal
and
that
an
inferior
state
of
soul
is
its
own
purgatory
and
determines
its
own
duration
in
one
place
at
any
rate
dante
proclaims
the
intrinsic
nature
of
punishment
in
express
terms
among
the
blasphemers
is
a
certain
king
of
thebes
who
defied
the
thunderbolts
of
jupiter
he
shows
himself
indifferent
to
his
punishment
and
says
such
as
i
was
alive
such
i
am
dead
whereupon
virgil
exclaims
with
a
force
dante
had
never
found
in
his
voice
before
in
that
thy
pride
is
not
mortified
thou
art
punished
the
more
no
torture
other
than
thy
own
rage
would
be
woe
enough
to
match
thy
fury
and
indeed
dante
imagination
can
not
outdo
it
can
not
even
equal
the
horrors
which
men
have
brought
upon
themselves
in
this
world
if
we
were
to
choose
the
most
fearful
of
the
scenes
in
the
we
should
have
to
choose
the
story
of
ugolino
but
this
is
only
a
pale
recital
of
what
pisa
had
actually
witnessed
a
more
subtle
and
interesting
instance
if
a
less
obvious
one
may
be
found
in
the
punishment
of
paolo
and
francesca
di
rimini
what
makes
these
lovers
so
wretched
in
the
inferno
they
are
still
together
can
an
eternity
of
floating
on
the
wind
in
each
other
arms
be
a
punishment
for
lovers
that
is
just
what
their
passion
if
left
to
speak
for
itself
would
have
chosen
it
is
what
passion
stops
at
and
would
gladly
prolong
for
ever
divine
judgement
has
only
taken
it
at
its
word
this
fate
is
precisely
what
aucassin
in
the
tale
wishes
for
himself
and
his
sweetheart
nicolette
not
a
heaven
to
be
won
by
renunciation
but
the
possession
even
if
it
be
in
hell
of
what
he
loves
and
fancies
and
a
great
romantic
poet
alfred
de
musset
actually
upbraids
dante
for
not
seeing
that
such
an
eternal
destiny
as
he
has
assigned
to
paolo
and
francesca
would
be
not
the
ruin
of
their
love
but
the
perfect
fulfilment
of
it
this
last
seems
to
be
very
true
but
did
dante
overlook
the
truth
of
it
if
so
what
instinct
guided
him
to
choose
just
the
fate
for
these
lovers
that
they
would
have
chosen
for
themselves
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
apprentices
in
life
and
the
masters
aucassin
and
alfred
de
musset
were
among
the
apprentices
dante
was
one
of
the
masters
he
could
feel
the
fresh
promptings
of
life
as
keenly
as
any
youngster
or
any
romanticist
but
he
had
lived
these
things
through
he
knew
the
possible
and
the
impossible
issue
of
them
he
saw
their
relation
to
the
rest
of
human
nature
and
to
the
ideal
of
an
ultimate
happiness
and
peace
he
had
discovered
the
necessity
of
saying
continually
to
oneself
thou
shalt
renounce
and
for
this
reason
he
needed
no
other
furniture
for
hell
than
the
literal
ideals
and
fulfilments
of
our
absolute
little
passions
the
soul
that
is
possessed
by
any
one
of
these
passions
nevertheless
has
other
hopes
in
abeyance
love
itself
dreams
of
more
than
mere
possession
to
conceive
happiness
it
must
conceive
a
life
to
be
shared
in
a
varied
world
full
of
events
and
activities
which
shall
be
new
and
ideal
bonds
between
the
lovers
but
unlawful
love
can
not
pass
out
into
this
public
fulfilment
it
is
condemned
to
be
mere
possession
possession
in
the
dark
without
an
environment
without
a
future
it
is
love
among
the
ruins
and
it
is
precisely
this
that
is
the
torment
of
paolo
and
francesca
love
among
the
ruins
of
themselves
and
of
all
else
they
might
have
had
to
give
to
one
another
abandon
yourself
dante
would
say
to
us
abandon
yourself
altogether
to
a
love
that
is
nothing
but
love
and
you
are
in
hell
already
only
an
inspired
poet
could
be
so
subtle
a
moralist
only
a
sound
moralist
could
be
so
tragic
a
poet
the
same
tact
and
fine
feeling
that
appear
in
these
little
moral
dramas
appear
also
in
the
sympathetic
landscape
in
which
each
episode
is
set
the
poet
actually
accomplishes
the
feat
which
he
attributes
to
the
creator
he
evokes
a
material
world
to
be
the
fit
theatre
for
moral
attitudes
popular
imagination
and
the
precedents
of
homer
and
virgil
had
indeed
carried
him
halfway
in
this
symbolic
labour
as
tradition
almost
always
carries
a
poet
who
is
successful
mankind
from
remotest
antiquity
had
conceived
a
dark
subterranean
hell
inhabited
by
unhappy
ghosts
in
christian
times
these
shades
had
become
lost
souls
tormented
by
hideous
demons
but
dante
with
the
aristotelian
chart
of
the
vices
before
him
turned
those
vague
windy
caverns
into
a
symmetrical
labyrinth
seven
concentric
terraces
descended
step
by
step
towards
the
waters
of
the
styx
which
in
turn
encircled
the
brazen
walls
of
the
city
of
dis
or
pluto
within
these
walls
two
more
terraces
led
down
to
the
edge
of
a
prodigious
precipice
perhaps
a
thousand
miles
deep
which
formed
the
pit
of
hell
at
the
bottom
of
this
still
sinking
gently
towards
the
centre
were
ten
concentric
furrows
or
ditches
to
hold
ten
sorts
of
rogues
and
finally
a
last
sheer
precipice
fell
to
the
frozen
lake
of
cocytus
at
the
very
centre
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
which
lucifer
was
congealed
amongst
lesser
traitors
precision
and
horror
graphic
and
moral
truth
were
never
so
wonderfully
combined
as
in
the
description
of
this
hell
yet
the
conception
of
purgatory
is
more
original
and
perhaps
more
poetical
the
very
approach
to
the
place
is
enchanting
we
hear
of
it
first
in
the
fatal
adventure
ascribed
to
ulysses
by
dante
restless
at
ithaca
after
his
return
from
troy
the
hero
had
summoned
his
surviving
companions
for
a
last
voyage
of
discovery
he
had
sailed
with
them
past
the
pillars
of
hercules
skirting
the
african
shore
until
after
three
months
of
open
sea
he
saw
a
colossal
mountain
a
great
truncated
cone
looming
before
him
this
was
the
island
and
hill
of
purgatory
at
the
very
antipodes
of
jerusalem
yet
before
ulysses
could
land
there
a
squall
overtook
him
and
his
galley
sank
prow
foremost
in
that
untraversed
sea
within
sight
of
a
new
world
so
must
the
heathen
fail
of
salvation
though
some
oracular
impulse
bring
them
near
the
goal
how
easy
is
success
on
the
other
hand
to
the
ministers
of
grace
from
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
where
the
souls
of
christians
congregate
after
death
a
light
skiff
piloted
by
an
angel
and
propelled
only
by
his
white
wings
skims
the
sea
swiftly
towards
the
mountain
of
purgatory
there
deposits
the
spirits
it
carries
and
is
back
at
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
again
on
the
same
day
so
much
for
the
approach
to
purgatory
when
a
spirit
lands
it
finds
the
skirts
of
the
mountain
broad
and
spreading
but
the
slope
soon
becomes
hard
and
precipitous
when
he
has
passed
the
narrow
gate
of
repentance
he
must
stay
upon
each
of
the
ledges
that
encircle
the
mountain
at
various
heights
until
one
of
his
sins
is
purged
and
then
upon
the
next
ledge
above
if
he
has
been
guilty
also
of
the
sin
that
is
atoned
for
there
the
mountain
is
so
high
as
to
lift
its
head
into
the
sphere
of
the
moon
above
the
reach
of
terrestrial
tempests
the
top
which
is
a
broad
circular
plain
contains
the
garden
of
eden
watered
by
the
rivers
lethe
and
eunoe
one
to
heal
all
painful
memories
and
the
other
to
bring
all
good
thoughts
to
clearness
from
this
place
which
literally
touches
the
lowest
heaven
the
upward
flight
is
easy
from
sphere
to
sphere
the
astronomy
of
dante
day
fell
in
beautifully
with
his
poetic
task
it
described
and
measured
a
firmament
that
would
still
be
identified
with
the
posthumous
heaven
of
the
saints
the
whirling
invisible
spheres
of
that
astronomy
had
the
earth
for
their
centre
the
sublime
complexities
of
this
ptolemaic
system
were
day
and
night
before
mind
he
loves
to
tell
us
in
what
constellation
the
sun
is
rising
or
setting
and
what
portion
of
the
sky
is
then
over
the
antipodes
he
carries
in
his
mind
an
orrery
that
shows
him
at
any
given
moment
the
position
of
every
star
such
a
constant
dragging
in
of
astronomical
lore
may
seem
to
us
puerile
or
pedantic
but
for
dante
the
astronomical
situation
had
the
charm
of
a
landscape
literally
full
of
the
most
wonderful
lights
and
shadows
and
it
also
had
the
charm
of
a
discovery
that
unveiled
the
secrets
of
nature
to
think
straight
to
see
things
as
they
are
or
as
they
might
naturally
be
interested
him
more
than
to
fancy
things
impossible
and
in
this
he
shows
not
want
of
imagination
but
true
imaginative
power
and
imaginative
maturity
it
is
those
of
us
who
are
too
feeble
to
conceive
and
master
the
real
world
or
too
cowardly
to
face
it
that
run
away
from
it
to
those
cheap
fictions
that
alone
seem
to
us
fine
enough
for
poetry
or
for
religion
in
dante
the
fancy
is
not
empty
or
arbitrary
it
is
serious
fed
on
the
study
of
real
things
it
adopts
their
tendency
and
divines
their
true
destiny
his
art
is
in
the
original
greek
sense
an
imitation
or
rehearsal
of
nature
an
anticipation
of
fate
for
this
reason
curious
details
of
science
or
theology
enter
as
a
matter
of
course
into
his
verse
with
the
straightforward
faith
and
simplicity
of
his
age
he
devours
these
interesting
images
which
help
him
to
clarify
the
mysteries
of
this
world
there
is
a
kind
of
sensualism
or
aestheticism
that
has
decreed
in
our
day
that
theory
is
not
poetical
as
if
all
the
images
and
emotions
that
enter
a
cultivated
mind
were
not
saturated
with
theory
the
prevalence
of
such
a
sensualism
or
aestheticism
would
alone
suffice
to
explain
the
impotence
of
the
arts
the
life
of
theory
is
not
less
human
or
less
emotional
than
the
life
of
sense
it
is
more
typically
human
and
more
keenly
emotional
philosophy
is
a
more
intense
sort
of
experience
than
common
life
is
just
as
pure
and
subtle
music
heard
in
retirement
is
something
keener
and
more
intense
than
the
howling
of
storms
or
the
rumble
of
cities
for
this
reason
philosophy
when
a
poet
is
not
mindless
enters
inevitably
into
his
poetry
since
it
has
entered
into
his
life
or
rather
the
detail
of
things
and
the
detail
of
ideas
pass
equally
into
his
verse
when
both
alike
lie
in
the
path
that
has
led
him
to
his
ideal
to
object
to
theory
in
poetry
would
be
like
objecting
to
words
there
for
words
too
are
symbols
without
the
sensuous
character
of
the
things
they
stand
for
and
yet
it
is
only
by
the
net
of
new
connections
which
words
throw
over
things
in
recalling
them
that
poetry
arises
at
all
poetry
is
an
attenuation
a
rehandling
an
echo
of
crude
experience
it
is
itself
a
theoretic
vision
of
things
at
length
never
before
or
since
has
a
poet
lived
in
so
large
a
landscape
as
dante
for
our
infinite
times
and
distances
are
of
little
poetic
value
while
we
have
no
graphic
image
of
what
may
fill
them
dante
spaces
were
filled
they
enlarged
to
the
limits
of
human
imagination
the
habitations
and
destinies
of
mankind
although
the
saints
did
not
literally
inhabit
the
spheres
but
the
empyrean
beyond
yet
each
spirit
could
be
manifested
in
that
sphere
the
genius
of
which
was
most
akin
to
his
own
in
dante
vision
spirits
appear
as
points
of
light
from
which
voices
also
flow
sometimes
as
well
as
radiance
further
than
reporting
their
words
which
are
usually
about
the
things
of
earth
dante
tells
us
little
about
them
he
has
indeed
at
the
end
a
vision
of
a
celestial
rose
tier
upon
tier
of
saints
are
seated
as
in
an
amphitheatre
and
the
deity
overarches
them
in
the
form
of
a
triple
rainbow
with
a
semblance
of
man
in
the
midst
but
this
is
avowedly
a
mere
symbol
a
somewhat
conventional
picture
to
which
dante
has
recourse
unwillingly
for
want
of
a
better
image
to
render
his
mystical
intention
what
may
perhaps
help
us
to
divine
this
intention
is
the
fact
just
mentioned
that
according
to
him
the
celestial
spheres
are
not
the
real
seat
of
any
human
soul
that
the
pure
rise
through
them
with
increasing
ease
and
velocity
the
nearer
they
come
to
god
and
that
the
eyes
of
beatrice
the
revelation
of
god
to
man
are
only
mirrors
shedding
merely
reflected
beauty
and
light
these
hints
suggest
the
doctrine
that
the
goal
of
life
is
the
very
bosom
of
god
not
any
finite
form
of
existence
however
excellent
but
a
complete
absorption
and
disappearance
in
the
godhead
so
the
neoplatonists
had
thought
from
whom
all
this
heavenly
landscape
is
borrowed
and
the
reservations
that
christian
orthodoxy
requires
have
not
always
remained
present
to
the
minds
of
christian
mystics
and
poets
dante
broaches
this
very
point
in
the
memorable
interview
he
has
with
the
spirit
of
piccarda
in
the
third
canto
of
the
she
is
in
the
lowest
sphere
of
heaven
that
of
the
inconstant
moon
because
after
she
had
been
stolen
from
her
convent
and
forcibly
married
she
felt
no
prompting
to
renew
her
earlier
vows
dante
asks
her
if
she
never
longs
for
a
higher
station
in
paradise
one
nearer
to
god
the
natural
goal
of
all
aspiration
she
answers
that
to
share
the
will
of
god
who
has
established
many
different
mansions
in
his
house
is
to
be
truly
one
with
him
the
wish
to
be
nearer
god
would
actually
carry
the
soul
farther
away
since
it
would
oppose
the
order
he
has
established
even
in
heaven
therefore
the
christian
saint
was
to
keep
his
essential
fidelity
separation
and
lowliness
he
was
to
feel
still
helpless
and
lost
in
himself
like
tobias
and
happy
only
in
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
was
holding
him
by
the
hand
for
piccarda
to
say
that
she
accepts
the
will
of
god
means
not
that
she
shares
it
but
that
she
submits
to
it
she
would
fain
go
higher
for
her
moral
nature
demands
it
as
dante
incorrigible
platonist
perfectly
perceived
but
she
dare
not
mention
it
for
she
knows
that
god
whose
thoughts
are
not
her
thoughts
has
forbidden
it
the
inconstant
sphere
of
the
moon
does
not
afford
her
a
perfect
happiness
but
chastened
as
she
is
she
says
it
brings
her
happiness
enough
all
that
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart
has
the
courage
to
hope
for
such
are
the
conflicting
inspirations
beneath
the
lovely
harmonies
of
the
it
was
not
the
poet
soul
that
was
in
conflict
here
it
was
only
his
traditions
the
conflicts
of
his
own
spirit
had
been
left
behind
in
other
regions
on
that
of
earth
which
from
the
height
of
heaven
he
looked
back
upon
with
wonder
surprised
that
men
should
take
so
passionately
this
trouble
of
ants
which
he
judges
best
says
dante
who
thinks
least
of
it
in
this
saying
the
poet
is
perhaps
conscious
of
a
personal
fault
for
dante
was
far
from
perfect
even
as
a
poet
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
his
own
time
and
often
wrote
with
a
passion
not
clarified
into
judgement
so
much
does
the
purely
personal
and
dramatic
interest
dominate
us
as
we
read
of
a
boniface
or
an
ugolino
that
we
forget
that
these
historical
figures
are
supposed
to
have
been
transmuted
into
the
eternal
and
to
have
become
bits
in
the
mosaic
of
platonic
essences
dante
himself
almost
forgets
it
the
modern
reader
accustomed
to
insignificant
wayward
fictions
and
expecting
to
be
entertained
by
images
without
thoughts
may
not
notice
this
lack
of
perspective
or
may
rejoice
in
it
but
if
he
is
judicious
he
will
not
rejoice
in
it
long
the
bonifaces
and
the
ugolinos
are
not
the
truly
deep
the
truly
lovely
figures
of
the
they
are
in
a
relative
sense
the
vulgarities
in
it
we
feel
too
much
in
these
cases
the
heat
of
the
poet
prejudice
or
indignation
he
is
not
just
as
he
usually
is
he
does
not
stop
to
think
as
he
almost
always
does
he
forgets
that
he
is
in
the
eternal
world
and
dips
for
the
moment
into
a
brawl
in
some
italian
or
into
the
of
some
factious
the
passages
such
as
those
about
boniface
and
ugolino
which
dante
writes
in
this
mood
are
powerful
and
vehement
but
they
are
not
beautiful
they
brand
the
object
of
their
invective
more
than
they
reveal
it
they
shock
more
than
they
move
the
reader
this
lower
kind
of
success
for
it
is
still
a
success
in
rhetoric
falls
to
the
poet
because
he
has
abandoned
the
platonic
half
of
his
inspiration
and
has
become
for
the
moment
wholly
historical
wholly
hebraic
or
roman
he
would
have
been
a
far
inferior
mind
if
he
had
always
moved
on
this
level
with
the
platonic
spheres
and
the
aristotelian
ethics
taken
out
his
would
not
have
been
divine
persons
and
incidents
to
be
truly
memorable
have
to
be
rendered
significant
they
have
to
be
seen
in
their
place
in
the
moral
world
they
have
to
be
judged
and
judged
rightly
in
their
dignity
and
value
a
casual
personal
sentiment
towards
them
however
passionate
can
not
take
the
place
of
the
sympathetic
insight
that
comprehends
and
the
wide
experience
that
judges
again
what
is
fundamental
with
dante
love
as
he
feels
and
renders
it
is
not
normal
or
healthy
love
it
was
doubtless
real
enough
but
too
much
restrained
and
expressed
too
much
in
fancy
so
that
when
it
is
extended
platonically
and
identified
so
easily
with
the
grace
of
god
and
with
revealed
wisdom
we
feel
the
suspicion
that
if
the
love
in
question
had
been
natural
and
manly
it
would
have
offered
more
resistance
to
so
mystical
a
transformation
the
poet
who
wishes
to
pass
convincingly
from
love
to
philosophy
and
that
seems
a
natural
progress
for
a
poet
should
accordingly
be
a
hearty
and
complete
lover
a
lover
like
goethe
and
his
faust
rather
than
like
plato
and
dante
faust
too
passes
from
gretchen
to
helen
and
partly
back
again
and
goethe
made
even
more
passages
had
any
of
them
led
to
something
which
not
only
was
loved
but
deserved
to
be
loved
which
not
only
could
inspire
a
whole
life
but
which
ought
to
inspire
it
then
we
should
have
had
a
genuine
progress
in
the
next
place
dante
talks
too
much
about
himself
there
is
a
sense
in
which
this
egotism
is
a
merit
or
at
least
a
ground
of
interest
for
us
moderns
for
egotism
is
the
distinctive
attitude
of
modern
philosophy
and
of
romantic
sentiment
in
being
egotistical
dante
was
ahead
of
his
time
his
philosophy
would
have
lost
an
element
of
depth
and
his
poetry
an
element
of
pathos
had
he
not
placed
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
described
everything
as
his
experience
or
as
a
revelation
made
to
himself
and
made
for
the
sake
of
his
personal
salvation
but
dante
egotism
goes
rather
further
than
was
requisite
so
that
the
transcendental
insight
might
not
fail
in
his
philosophy
it
extended
so
far
that
he
cast
the
shadow
of
his
person
not
only
over
the
terraces
of
purgatory
as
he
is
careful
to
tell
us
repeatedly
but
over
the
whole
of
italy
and
of
europe
which
he
saw
and
judged
under
the
evident
influence
of
private
passions
and
resentments
moreover
the
personality
thrust
forward
so
obtrusively
is
not
in
every
respect
worthy
of
contemplation
dante
is
very
proud
and
very
bitter
at
the
same
time
he
is
curiously
timid
and
one
may
tire
sometimes
of
his
perpetual
tremblings
and
tears
of
his
fainting
fits
and
his
intricate
doubts
a
man
who
knows
he
is
under
the
special
protection
of
god
and
of
three
celestial
ladies
and
who
has
such
a
sage
and
magician
as
virgil
for
a
guide
might
have
looked
even
upon
hell
with
a
little
more
confidence
how
far
is
this
shivering
and
swooning
philosopher
from
the
laughing
courage
of
faust
who
sees
his
poodle
swell
into
a
monster
then
into
a
cloud
and
finally
change
into
mephistopheles
and
says
at
once
also
war
des
pudels
doubtless
dante
was
mediaeval
and
contrition
humility
and
fear
of
the
devil
were
great
virtues
in
those
days
but
the
conclusion
we
must
come
to
is
precisely
that
the
virtues
of
those
days
were
not
the
best
virtues
and
that
a
poet
who
represents
that
time
can
not
be
a
fair
nor
an
ultimate
spokesman
for
humanity
perhaps
we
have
now
reviewed
the
chief
objects
that
peopled
imagination
the
chief
objects
into
the
midst
of
which
his
poetry
transports
us
and
if
a
poet
genius
avails
to
transport
us
into
his
enchanted
world
the
character
of
that
world
will
determine
the
quality
and
dignity
of
his
poetry
dante
transports
us
with
unmistakable
power
first
into
the
atmosphere
of
a
visionary
love
then
into
the
history
of
his
conversion
affected
by
this
love
or
by
the
divine
grace
identified
with
it
the
supreme
ideal
to
which
his
conversion
brought
him
back
is
expressed
for
him
by
universal
nature
and
is
embodied
among
men
in
the
double
institution
of
a
revealed
religion
and
a
providential
empire
to
trace
the
fortunes
of
these
institutions
we
are
transported
next
into
the
panorama
of
history
in
its
great
crises
and
its
great
men
and
particularly
into
the
panorama
of
italy
in
the
poet
time
where
we
survey
the
crimes
the
virtues
and
the
sorrows
of
those
prominent
in
furthering
or
thwarting
the
ideal
of
christendom
these
numerous
persons
are
set
before
us
with
the
sympathy
and
brevity
of
a
dramatist
yet
it
is
no
mere
carnival
no
for
throughout
above
the
confused
strife
of
parties
and
passions
we
hear
the
steady
voice
the
implacable
sentence
of
the
prophet
that
judges
them
thus
dante
gifted
with
the
tenderest
sense
of
colour
and
the
firmest
art
of
design
has
put
his
whole
world
into
his
canvas
seen
there
that
world
becomes
complete
clear
beautiful
and
tragic
it
is
vivid
and
truthful
in
its
detail
sublime
in
its
march
and
in
its
harmony
this
is
not
poetry
where
the
parts
are
better
than
the
whole
here
as
in
some
great
symphony
everything
is
cumulative
the
movements
conspire
the
tension
grows
the
volume
redoubles
the
keen
melody
soars
higher
and
higher
and
it
all
ends
not
with
a
bang
not
with
some
casual
incident
but
in
sustained
reflection
in
the
sense
that
it
has
not
ended
but
remains
by
us
in
its
totality
a
revelation
and
a
resource
for
ever
it
has
taught
us
to
love
and
to
renounce
to
judge
and
to
what
more
could
a
poet
do
dante
poetized
all
life
and
nature
as
he
found
them
his
imagination
dominated
and
focused
the
whole
world
he
thereby
touched
the
ultimate
goal
to
which
a
poet
can
aspire
he
set
the
standard
for
all
possible
performance
and
became
the
type
of
a
supreme
poet
this
is
not
to
say
that
he
is
the
greatest
of
poets
the
relative
merit
of
poets
is
a
barren
thing
to
wrangle
about
the
question
can
always
be
opened
anew
when
a
critic
appears
with
a
fresh
temperament
or
a
new
criterion
even
less
need
we
say
that
no
greater
poet
can
ever
arise
we
may
be
confident
of
the
opposite
but
dante
gives
a
successful
example
of
the
of
poetry
his
poetry
covers
the
whole
field
from
which
poetry
may
be
fetched
and
to
which
poetry
may
be
applied
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
heart
to
the
uttermost
bounds
of
nature
and
of
destiny
if
to
give
imaginative
value
to
something
is
the
minimum
task
of
a
poet
to
give
imaginative
value
to
all
things
and
to
the
system
which
things
compose
is
evidently
his
greatest
task
dante
fulfilled
this
task
of
course
under
special
conditions
and
limitations
personal
and
social
but
he
fulfilled
it
and
he
thereby
fulfilled
the
conditions
of
supreme
poetry
even
homer
as
we
are
beginning
to
perceive
nowadays
suffered
from
a
certain
conventionality
and
there
was
much
in
the
life
and
religion
of
his
time
that
his
art
ignored
it
was
a
flattering
a
euphemistic
art
it
had
a
sort
of
pervasive
blandness
like
that
which
we
now
associate
with
a
fashionable
sermon
it
was
poetry
addressed
to
the
ruling
caste
in
the
state
to
the
conquerors
and
it
spread
an
intentional
glamour
over
their
past
brutalities
and
present
no
such
partiality
in
dante
he
paints
what
he
hates
as
frankly
as
what
he
loves
and
in
all
things
he
is
complete
and
sincere
if
any
similar
adequacy
is
attained
again
by
any
poet
it
will
not
be
presumably
by
a
poet
of
the
supernatural
henceforth
for
any
wide
and
honest
imagination
the
supernatural
must
figure
as
an
idea
in
the
human
mind
a
part
of
the
natural
to
conceive
it
otherwise
would
be
to
fall
short
of
the
insight
of
this
age
not
to
express
or
to
complete
it
dante
however
for
this
very
reason
may
be
expected
to
remain
the
supreme
poet
of
the
supernatural
the
unrivalled
exponent
after
plato
of
that
phase
of
thought
and
feeling
in
which
the
supernatural
seems
to
be
the
key
to
nature
and
to
happiness
this
is
the
hypothesis
on
which
as
yet
moral
unity
has
been
best
attained
in
this
world
here
then
we
have
the
most
complete
idealization
and
comprehension
of
things
achieved
by
mankind
hitherto

iv
goethe
faust
in
approaching
the
third
of
our
philosophical
poets
there
is
a
scruple
that
may
cross
the
mind
lucretius
was
undoubtedly
a
philosophical
poet
his
whole
poem
is
devoted
to
expounding
and
defending
a
system
of
philosophy
in
dante
the
case
is
almost
as
plain
the
is
a
moral
and
personal
fable
yet
not
only
are
many
passages
explicitly
philosophical
but
the
whole
is
inspired
and
controlled
by
the
most
definite
of
religious
systems
and
of
moral
codes
dante
too
is
unmistakably
a
philosophical
poet
but
was
goethe
a
philosopher
and
is
a
philosophical
poem
if
we
say
so
it
must
be
by
giving
a
certain
latitude
to
our
terms
goethe
was
the
wisest
of
mankind
too
wise
perhaps
to
be
a
philosopher
in
the
technical
sense
or
to
try
to
harness
this
wild
world
in
a
terminology
it
is
true
that
he
was
all
his
life
a
follower
of
spinoza
and
that
he
may
be
termed
without
hesitation
a
naturalist
in
philosophy
and
a
pantheist
his
adherence
to
the
general
attitude
of
spinoza
however
did
not
exclude
a
great
plasticity
and
freedom
in
his
own
views
even
on
the
most
fundamental
points
thus
goethe
did
not
admit
the
mechanical
interpretation
of
nature
advocated
by
spinoza
he
also
assigned
at
least
to
privileged
souls
like
his
own
a
more
personal
sort
of
immortality
than
spinoza
allowed
moreover
he
harboured
a
generous
sympathy
with
the
dramatic
explanations
of
nature
and
history
current
in
the
germany
of
his
day
yet
such
transcendental
idealism
making
the
world
the
expression
of
a
spiritual
endeavour
was
a
total
reversal
of
that
conviction
so
profound
in
spinoza
that
all
moral
energies
are
resident
in
particular
creatures
themselves
sparks
in
an
absolutely
infinite
and
purposeless
world
in
a
word
goethe
was
not
a
systematic
philosopher
his
feeling
for
the
march
of
things
and
for
the
significance
of
great
personages
and
great
ideas
was
indeed
philosophical
although
more
romantic
than
scientific
his
thoughts
upon
life
were
fresh
and
miscellaneous
they
voiced
the
genius
and
learning
of
his
age
they
did
not
express
a
firm
personal
attitude
radical
and
unified
and
transmissible
to
other
times
and
persons
for
philosophers
after
all
have
this
advantage
over
men
of
letters
that
their
minds
being
more
organic
can
more
easily
propagate
themselves
they
scatter
less
influence
but
more
seeds
if
from
goethe
we
turn
to
and
it
is
as
the
author
of
only
that
we
shall
consider
him
the
situation
is
not
less
ambiguous
in
the
play
as
the
young
goethe
first
wrote
it
philosophy
appeared
in
the
first
line
nun
ach
die
but
it
appeared
there
and
throughout
the
piece
merely
as
a
human
experience
a
passion
or
an
illusion
a
fund
of
images
or
an
ambitious
art
later
it
is
true
under
the
spell
of
fashion
and
of
schiller
goethe
surrounded
his
original
scenes
with
others
like
the
prologue
in
heaven
or
the
apotheosis
of
faust
in
which
a
philosophy
of
life
was
indicated
namely
that
he
who
strives
strays
yet
in
that
straying
finds
his
salvation
this
idea
left
standing
all
that
satirical
and
mephistophelian
wisdom
with
which
the
whole
poem
abounds
the
later
parts
no
less
than
the
earlier
frankly
it
was
a
moral
that
adorned
the
tale
without
having
been
the
seed
of
it
and
without
even
expressing
fairly
the
spirit
which
it
breathes
remained
an
essentially
romantic
poem
written
to
give
vent
to
a
pregnant
and
vivid
genius
to
touch
the
heart
to
bewilder
the
mind
with
a
carnival
of
images
to
amuse
to
thrill
to
humanize
and
if
we
must
speak
of
philosophy
there
were
many
express
maxims
in
the
poem
and
many
insights
half
betrayed
that
exceeded
in
philosophic
value
the
belated
and
official
moral
which
the
author
affixed
to
it
and
which
he
himself
warned
us
not
to
take
too
seriously
is
then
no
philosophical
poem
after
an
open
or
deliberate
fashion
and
yet
it
offers
a
solution
to
the
moral
problem
of
existence
as
truly
as
do
the
poems
of
lucretius
and
dante
heard
philosophies
are
sweet
but
those
unheard
may
be
sweeter
they
may
be
more
unmixed
and
more
profound
for
being
adopted
unconsciously
for
being
lived
rather
than
taught
this
is
not
merely
to
say
what
might
be
said
of
every
work
of
art
and
of
every
natural
object
that
it
could
be
made
the
for
a
chain
of
inferences
that
should
reveal
the
whole
universe
like
the
flower
in
the
crannied
wall
it
is
to
say
rather
that
the
vital
straining
towards
an
ideal
definite
but
latent
when
it
dominates
a
whole
life
may
express
that
ideal
more
fully
than
could
the
words
now
is
the
foam
on
the
top
of
two
great
waves
of
human
aspiration
merging
and
heaping
themselves
up
together
the
wave
of
romanticism
rising
from
the
depths
of
northern
traditions
and
genius
and
the
wave
of
a
new
paganism
coming
from
greece
over
italy
these
are
not
philosophies
to
be
read
into
by
the
critic
they
are
passions
seething
in
the
drama
it
is
the
drama
of
a
philosophical
adventure
a
rebellion
against
convention
a
flight
to
nature
to
tenderness
to
beauty
and
then
a
return
to
convention
again
with
a
feeling
that
nature
tenderness
and
beauty
unless
found
there
will
not
be
found
at
all
goethe
never
depicts
as
dante
does
the
object
his
hero
is
pursuing
he
is
satisfied
with
depicting
the
pursuit
like
lessing
in
his
famous
apologue
he
prefers
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
to
the
ideal
itself
perhaps
as
in
the
case
of
lessing
because
the
hope
of
realizing
the
ideal
and
the
interest
in
realizing
it
were
beginning
to
forsake
him
the
case
is
somewhat
as
that
of
dante
would
have
been
if
instead
of
recognizing
and
loving
beatrice
at
first
sight
and
rising
into
a
vision
of
the
eternal
world
and
perfectly
ordered
dante
had
passed
from
love
to
love
from
to
always
longing
for
the
eyes
of
beatrice
without
ever
meeting
them
the
would
then
have
been
only
human
yet
it
might
have
suggested
and
required
the
very
consummation
that
the
depicts
and
without
expressing
this
consummation
our
human
comedy
might
have
furnished
materials
and
momentum
for
it
such
that
if
ever
that
consummation
came
to
be
expressed
it
would
be
more
deeply
felt
and
more
adequately
understood
dante
gives
us
a
philosophical
goal
and
we
have
to
recall
and
retrace
the
journey
goethe
gives
us
a
philosophic
journey
and
we
have
to
divine
the
goal
goethe
is
a
romantic
poet
he
is
a
novelist
in
verse
he
is
a
philosopher
of
experience
as
it
comes
to
the
individual
the
philosopher
of
life
as
action
memory
or
soliloquy
may
put
life
before
each
of
us
in
turn
now
the
zest
of
romanticism
consists
in
taking
what
you
know
is
an
independent
and
ancient
world
as
if
it
were
material
for
your
private
emotions
the
savage
or
the
animal
who
should
not
be
aware
of
nature
or
history
at
all
could
not
be
romantic
about
them
nor
about
himself
he
would
be
blandly
idiotic
and
take
everything
quite
unsuspectingly
for
what
it
was
in
him
the
romanticist
then
should
be
a
civilized
man
so
that
his
primitiveness
and
egotism
may
have
something
paradoxical
and
conscious
about
them
and
so
that
his
life
may
contain
a
rich
experience
and
his
reflection
may
play
with
all
varieties
of
sentiment
and
thought
at
the
same
time
in
his
inmost
genius
he
should
be
a
barbarian
a
child
a
transcendentalist
so
that
his
life
may
seem
to
him
absolutely
fresh
unforeseen
and
unforeseeable
it
is
part
of
his
inspiration
to
believe
that
he
creates
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
with
each
revolution
in
his
moods
or
in
his
purposes
he
ignores
or
seeks
to
ignore
all
the
conditions
of
life
until
perhaps
by
living
he
personally
discovers
them
like
faust
he
flouts
science
and
is
minded
to
make
trial
of
magic
which
renders
a
man
will
master
of
the
universe
in
which
he
seems
to
live
he
disowns
all
authority
save
that
mysteriously
exercised
over
him
by
his
deep
faith
in
himself
he
is
always
honest
and
brave
but
he
is
always
different
and
absolves
himself
from
his
past
as
soon
as
he
has
outgrown
or
forgotten
it
he
is
inclined
to
be
wayward
and
foolhardy
justifying
himself
on
the
ground
that
all
experience
is
interesting
that
the
springs
of
it
are
inexhaustible
and
always
pure
and
that
the
future
of
his
soul
is
infinite
in
the
romantic
hero
the
civilized
man
and
the
barbarian
must
be
combined
he
should
be
the
heir
to
all
civilization
and
nevertheless
he
should
take
life
arrogantly
and
egotistically
as
if
it
were
an
absolute
personal
experiment
this
singular
combination
was
strikingly
exemplified
in
doctor
johannes
faustus
a
figure
half
historical
half
legendary
familiar
to
goethe
in
his
boyhood
in
and
chapbooks
an
adventurer
in
the
romantic
as
well
as
in
the
vulgar
sense
of
the
word
somewhat
like
paracelsus
or
giordano
bruno
doctor
faustus
had
felt
the
mystery
of
nature
had
scorned
authority
had
credited
magic
had
lived
by
imposture
and
had
fled
from
the
police
his
blasphemous
boasts
and
rascally
conduct
together
with
his
magic
arts
had
made
him
even
in
his
lifetime
a
scandalous
and
interesting
personage
he
was
scarcely
dead
when
legends
gathered
about
his
name
it
was
published
abroad
that
he
had
sold
his
soul
to
the
devil
in
exchange
for
years
of
wild
pleasures
upon
earth
this
legend
purported
to
offer
a
terrible
and
edifying
example
a
warning
to
all
christians
to
avoid
the
snares
of
science
of
pleasure
and
of
ambition
these
things
had
sent
doctor
faustus
into
his
corpse
found
face
downward
could
not
be
turned
over
upon
its
back
nevertheless
we
may
suspect
that
even
at
the
beginning
people
recognized
in
doctor
faustus
a
braver
brother
a
somewhat
enviable
reprobate
who
had
dared
to
relish
the
good
things
of
this
life
above
the
sad
joys
vaguely
promised
for
the
other
all
that
the
renaissance
valued
was
here
represented
as
in
the
devil
gift
and
the
man
in
the
street
might
well
doubt
whether
it
was
religion
or
worldly
life
that
was
thereby
made
the
more
unlovely
doubtless
the
lutheran
authors
of
the
first
chapbook
felt
and
felt
rightly
that
those
fine
things
which
tempted
faustus
were
unevangelical
pagan
and
popish
yet
they
could
not
cease
altogether
to
admire
and
even
to
covet
them
especially
when
the
first
ardours
of
the
revival
had
had
time
to
cool
marlowe
who
wrote
only
a
few
years
later
made
a
beginning
in
the
rehabilitation
of
the
hero
his
faustus
is
still
damned
but
he
is
transformed
into
the
sort
of
personage
that
aristotle
approves
of
for
the
hero
of
tragedy
essentially
human
and
noble
but
led
astray
by
some
excusable
vice
or
error
marlowe
public
would
see
in
doctor
faustus
a
man
and
a
christian
like
themselves
carried
a
bit
too
far
by
ambition
and
the
love
of
pleasure
he
is
no
radical
unbeliever
no
natural
mate
for
the
devil
conscienceless
and
heathen
like
the
typical
villain
of
the
renaissance
on
the
contrary
he
has
become
a
good
protestant
and
holds
manfully
to
all
those
parts
of
the
creed
which
express
his
spontaneous
affections
a
good
angel
is
often
overheard
whispering
in
his
ear
and
if
the
bad
angel
finally
prevails
it
is
in
spite
of
continual
remorse
and
hesitation
on
the
doctor
part
this
excellent
faustus
is
damned
by
accident
or
by
predestination
he
is
by
the
devil
and
forbidden
to
repent
when
he
has
really
repented
the
terror
of
the
conclusion
is
thereby
heightened
we
see
an
essentially
good
man
because
in
a
moment
of
infatuation
he
had
signed
away
his
soul
driven
against
his
will
to
despair
and
damnation
the
alternative
of
a
happy
solution
lies
almost
at
hand
and
it
is
only
a
lingering
taste
for
the
lurid
and
the
horrible
ingrained
in
this
sort
of
melodrama
that
sends
him
shrieking
to
hell
what
makes
marlowe
conclusion
the
more
violent
and
the
more
unphilosophical
is
the
fact
that
to
any
one
not
dominated
by
convention
the
good
angel
in
the
dialogue
seems
to
have
so
much
the
worse
of
the
argument
all
he
has
to
offer
is
sour
admonition
and
external
warnings
faustus
lay
that
damned
book
aside
gaze
not
on
it
lest
it
tempt
thy
soul
heap
god
heavy
wrath
upon
thy
read
the
scriptures
that
is
blasphemy
faustus
think
of
heaven
and
heavenly
to
which
the
evil
angel
replies
faustus
think
of
honour
and
of
and
in
another
place
forward
faustus
in
that
famous
art
all
nature
treasure
is
thou
on
earth
as
jove
is
in
the
sky
and
commander
of
these
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
devil
here
represents
the
natural
ideal
of
faustus
or
of
any
child
of
the
renaissance
he
appeals
to
the
vague
but
healthy
ambitions
of
a
young
soul
that
would
make
trial
of
the
world
in
other
words
this
devil
represents
the
true
good
and
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
honest
faustus
can
not
resist
his
suggestions
we
like
him
for
his
love
of
life
for
his
trust
in
nature
for
his
enthusiasm
for
beauty
he
speaks
for
us
all
when
he
cries
this
the
face
that
launched
a
thousand
burnt
the
topless
towers
of
ilium
even
his
irreverent
pranks
being
directed
against
the
pope
endear
him
the
more
to
an
public
and
he
appeals
to
courtiers
and
cavaliers
by
his
lofty
poetical
scorn
for
such
crabbed
professions
as
the
law
medicine
or
theology
in
a
word
marlowe
faustus
is
a
martyr
to
everything
that
the
renaissance
prized
power
curious
knowledge
enterprise
wealth
and
beauty
how
thoroughly
marlowe
and
goethe
are
on
the
way
towards
reversing
the
christian
philosophy
of
life
may
be
seen
if
we
compare
for
a
moment
as
in
other
respects
has
often
been
done
with
of
calderon
this
earlier
hero
cyprian
of
antioch
is
like
faust
in
being
a
scholar
signing
away
his
soul
to
the
devil
practising
magic
embracing
the
ghost
of
beauty
and
being
ultimately
saved
here
the
analogy
ends
cyprian
far
from
being
disgusted
with
all
theory
and
particularly
with
theology
is
a
pagan
philosopher
eagerly
seeking
god
and
working
his
way
with
full
faith
in
his
method
toward
christian
orthodoxy
he
floors
the
devil
in
scholastic
argument
about
the
unity
of
god
his
power
wisdom
and
goodness
he
falls
in
love
and
sells
his
soul
merely
in
the
hope
of
satisfying
his
passion
he
studies
magic
chiefly
for
the
same
reason
but
magic
can
not
overrule
the
of
the
christian
lady
he
loves
a
modern
and
very
spanish
one
though
supposed
to
adorn
ancient
antioch
the
devil
can
supply
only
a
false
phantasm
of
her
person
and
as
cyprian
approaches
her
and
lifts
her
veil
he
finds
a
hideous
beneath
for
god
can
work
miracles
to
cap
those
of
any
magician
and
can
beat
the
devil
at
his
own
game
thunderstruck
at
this
portent
cyprian
becomes
a
christian
ecstatic
taken
for
a
madman
he
bears
witness
loudly
and
persistently
to
the
power
wisdom
and
goodness
of
the
one
true
god
and
since
the
persecution
of
decius
is
then
going
on
he
is
hurried
away
to
martyrdom
his
lady
sentenced
also
for
the
same
cause
encourages
him
by
her
heroic
attitude
and
words
their
earthly
passion
is
dead
but
their
souls
are
united
in
death
and
in
immortality
in
this
drama
we
see
magic
checkmated
by
miracles
doubt
yielding
to
faith
purity
resisting
temptation
passion
transformed
into
zeal
and
all
the
glories
of
the
world
collapsing
before
disillusion
and
asceticism
these
glories
are
nothing
the
poet
tells
us
but
dust
ashes
smoke
and
air
the
contrast
with
goethe
could
not
be
more
complete
both
poets
take
the
greatest
liberties
with
their
chronology
yet
the
spirit
of
their
dramas
is
remarkably
true
to
the
respective
ages
in
which
they
are
supposed
to
occur
calderon
glorifies
the
movement
from
paganism
to
christianity
the
philosophy
in
which
that
movement
culminated
catholic
orthodoxy
still
dominates
the
poet
mind
not
in
a
perfunctory
way
but
so
as
to
kindle
his
imagination
and
render
his
personages
sublime
and
his
verses
rapturous
goethe
on
the
contrary
glorifies
the
return
from
christianity
to
paganism
it
shows
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
liberating
the
soul
and
bursting
the
bonds
of
traditional
faith
and
traditional
morals
this
spirit
after
manifesting
itself
brilliantly
at
the
time
of
the
historical
faust
had
seemed
to
be
smothered
in
the
great
world
during
the
seventeenth
century
characters
and
laws
had
reaffirmed
their
old
allegiance
to
christianity
and
the
renaissance
survived
only
abstractly
in
scholarship
or
the
fine
arts
to
which
it
continued
to
lend
a
certain
classic
or
elegance
in
goethe
time
however
a
second
renaissance
was
taking
place
in
the
souls
of
men
the
love
of
life
primal
and
adventurous
was
gathering
head
in
many
an
individual
in
the
romantic
movement
and
in
the
french
revolution
this
love
of
life
freed
itself
from
the
politic
compromises
and
conventions
that
had
been
stifling
it
for
two
hundred
years
goethe
hero
embodies
this
second
romantic
emancipation
of
the
mind
too
long
an
unwilling
pupil
of
christian
tradition
he
cries
for
air
for
nature
for
all
experience
cyprian
on
the
other
hand
an
unwilling
pupil
of
paganism
had
yearned
for
truth
for
solitude
and
for
heaven
such
was
the
legend
that
to
the
great
good
fortune
of
mankind
fascinated
the
young
goethe
and
took
root
in
his
fancy
around
it
gathered
the
experiences
and
insights
of
sixty
years
became
the
poetical
autobiography
and
the
philosophic
testament
of
goethe
he
stuffed
it
with
every
enthusiasm
that
diversified
his
own
life
from
the
great
alternative
of
romantic
or
classical
art
down
to
the
controversy
between
neptunism
and
vulcanism
in
geology
and
to
his
fatherly
admiration
for
lord
byron
yet
in
spite
of
the
liberties
he
took
with
the
legend
and
the
personal
turn
he
gave
it
nothing
in
its
historical
associations
escaped
him
his
life
in
frankfort
and
in
strassburg
had
made
the
mediaeval
scene
familiar
to
his
fancy
herder
had
communicated
to
him
an
imaginative
cult
for
all
that
was
national
and
characteristic
in
art
and
manners
the
spell
of
gothic
architecture
had
fallen
on
him
and
he
had
learned
to
feel
in
shakespeare
the
infinite
strength
of
suggestion
in
details
in
multitudinous
glimpses
in
lifelike
medleys
of
sadness
and
mirth
in
a
humble
realism
in
externals
amid
lyric
and
metaphysical
outpourings
of
the
passions
the
sense
for
classic
beauty
which
had
inspired
marlowe
with
immortal
lines
and
was
later
to
inspire
his
own
was
as
yet
dormant
but
instead
he
had
caught
the
humanitarian
craze
then
prevalent
for
defending
and
idealizing
the
victims
of
law
and
society
among
others
the
poor
girl
who
to
escape
disgrace
did
away
with
her
child
such
a
victim
of
a
selfish
seducer
and
a
pharisaical
public
was
to
add
a
desirable
touch
of
femininity
and
pathos
to
the
story
of
faust
gretchen
was
to
take
the
place
at
least
for
the
nonce
of
the
coveted
helen
this
gretchen
was
to
be
no
common
creature
but
one
endowed
with
all
the
innocence
sweetness
intelligence
fire
and
fortitude
which
goethe
was
finding
or
thought
he
was
finding
in
his
own
gretchens
kätchens
and
frederickes
for
the
young
goethe
though
very
learned
was
no
mere
student
of
books
to
his
human
competence
and
power
to
succeed
he
joined
the
gusts
of
feeling
the
irresponsible
raptures
the
sudden
sorrows
of
a
genuine
poet
he
was
a
true
lover
and
a
wayward
one
he
could
delve
into
magic
with
awe
in
a
spirit
of
adventure
he
could
burn
offerings
in
his
attic
to
the
rising
sun
he
could
plunge
into
christian
mysticism
and
there
could
well
up
on
occasion
from
the
deep
store
of
his
unconscious
mind
floods
of
words
of
images
and
of
tears
he
was
a
genius
if
ever
there
was
one
and
this
genius
in
all
its
freshness
was
poured
into
the
composition
of
the
most
kindred
of
themes
the
most
picturesque
and
magical
of
romances
in
goethe
first
version
of
the
poem
before
the
story
of
gretchen
we
find
the
studious
faust
as
in
marlowe
soliloquizing
on
the
vanity
of
the
sciences
they
grasp
nothing
of
the
genuine
truth
they
are
verbal
shams
they
have
not
even
brought
faust
fame
or
riches
perhaps
magic
might
do
better
the
air
was
full
of
spirits
could
they
be
summoned
to
our
aid
possibly
the
secrets
of
nature
might
be
unlocked
we
might
reach
true
science
and
through
it
power
over
the
material
world
for
nature
according
to
goethe
really
has
secrets
she
is
not
all
open
to
eventual
inspection
she
is
no
mere
mechanism
of
minute
parts
and
statable
laws
our
last
view
of
her
like
our
first
glimpse
must
be
interpreted
from
the
sum
of
her
manifestations
we
must
divine
her
soul
therefore
only
a
poetic
and
rhetorical
art
like
magic
has
any
chance
of
unveiling
her
and
of
bringing
us
face
to
face
with
the
truth
in
this
invocation
of
spirits
as
goethe
faust
makes
it
there
is
no
question
of
selling
or
even
of
risking
the
soul
this
faust
unlike
marlowe
has
no
faith
and
no
fear
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
church
he
is
damned
already
as
an
unbeliever
but
as
an
unbeliever
he
is
looking
for
salvation
in
another
quarter
like
the
bolder
spirits
of
the
renaissance
he
is
hoping
to
find
in
universal
nature
infinite
placid
an
escape
from
the
of
christian
doctrine
and
christian
law
his
magic
arts
are
the
sacrament
that
will
initiate
him
into
his
new
religion
the
religion
of
nature
he
turns
to
nature
also
in
another
sense
more
characteristic
of
the
age
of
goethe
than
of
that
of
faust
he
longs
for
grandiose
solitudes
he
feels
that
moonlight
caves
mountains
driving
clouds
would
be
his
best
medicine
and
his
best
counsellors
the
souls
of
rousseau
byron
and
shelley
are
in
this
faust
the
epitome
of
all
romantic
rebellions
they
coexist
there
with
the
souls
of
paracelsus
and
giordano
bruno
the
wild
aspects
of
nature
he
thinks
will
melt
and
renew
his
heart
while
magic
reveals
the
mysteries
of
cosmic
law
and
helps
him
to
exploit
them
full
of
these
hopes
faust
opens
his
book
of
magic
at
the
sign
of
the
macrocosm
it
shows
him
the
mechanism
of
the
world
all
forces
and
events
playing
into
one
another
and
forming
an
infinite
chain
the
spectacle
entrances
him
he
seems
to
have
attained
one
of
his
dearest
ambitions
but
here
he
comes
at
once
upon
the
other
half
or
as
hegel
would
call
it
the
other
moment
of
the
romantic
life
every
romantic
ideal
once
realized
disenchants
no
matter
what
we
attain
our
dissatisfaction
must
be
perpetual
thus
the
vision
of
the
universe
which
faust
now
has
before
him
is
he
remembers
only
a
vision
it
is
a
theory
or
conception
it
is
not
a
rendering
of
the
inner
life
of
the
world
as
shakespeare
for
instance
feels
and
renders
it
experience
as
it
comes
to
him
who
lives
and
works
is
not
given
by
that
theoretical
vision
in
science
experience
is
turned
into
so
many
reviewed
events
the
passage
of
so
much
substance
through
so
many
forms
but
faust
does
not
want
an
image
or
description
of
reality
he
yearns
to
enact
and
to
become
the
reality
itself
in
this
new
search
he
fixes
his
eye
on
the
sign
of
the
which
seems
more
propitious
to
his
present
wish
this
sign
is
the
key
to
all
experience
all
experience
tempts
faust
he
shrinks
from
nothing
that
any
mortal
may
have
endured
he
is
ready
to
undertake
everything
that
any
mortal
may
have
done
in
all
men
he
would
live
and
with
the
last
man
he
will
be
content
to
die
so
mighty
is
his
yearning
for
experience
that
the
is
softened
and
appears
at
his
bidding
in
a
red
flame
he
sees
its
monstrous
visage
and
his
enthusiasm
is
turned
to
horror
outspread
before
him
is
the
furious
indiscriminate
cataract
of
life
the
merciless
flux
the
infinite
variety
the
absolute
inconstancy
of
it
this
general
life
is
not
for
any
individual
to
rehearse
it
i
bursts
all
bounds
of
personality
each
man
may
assimilate
that
part
only
which
falls
within
his
understanding
only
that
aspect
which
things
wear
from
his
particular
angle
and
to
his
particular
interests
the
cries
to
him
gleichst
dem
geist
den
du
begreifst
nicht
this
saying
that
the
life
possible
and
good
for
man
is
the
life
of
reason
not
the
life
of
nature
is
a
hard
one
to
the
romantic
unintellectual
insatiable
faust
he
thinks
like
many
another
philosopher
of
feeling
that
since
his
is
a
part
of
the
sum
of
experience
the
whole
of
experience
should
be
akin
to
his
but
in
fact
the
opposite
is
far
nearer
the
truth
man
is
constituted
by
his
limitations
by
his
station
contrasted
with
all
other
stations
and
his
purposes
chosen
from
amongst
all
other
purposes
any
great
scope
he
can
attain
must
be
due
to
his
powers
of
representation
his
understanding
may
render
him
universal
his
life
never
can
faust
as
he
hears
this
sentence
from
the
departing
collapses
under
it
he
feels
impotent
to
gainsay
what
the
tumult
of
the
world
is
thundering
at
him
but
he
will
not
accept
on
authority
so
unwelcome
and
chastening
a
truth
all
his
long
experience
to
come
will
scarcely
suffice
to
convince
him
of
it
these
are
the
chief
philosophical
ideas
that
appear
in
the
two
earlier
versions
of
goethe
the
and
the
what
mephistopheles
says
to
the
young
student
is
only
a
clever
expansion
of
what
faust
had
said
in
his
first
monologue
about
the
vanity
of
science
and
of
the
learned
professions
mephistopheles
too
finds
theory
ashen
and
the
tree
of
life
green
and
full
of
golden
fruit
only
having
more
experience
than
faust
of
the
second
disenchanting
moment
in
the
romantic
dialectic
he
foresees
that
this
golden
fruit
also
will
turn
to
ashes
in
the
mouth
as
it
did
in
the
garden
of
eden
science
is
folly
but
life
is
no
better
for
after
all
is
not
science
a
part
of
life
when
we
turn
to
the
first
part
in
its
final
shape
or
to
the
entire
drama
we
find
many
changes
and
additions
that
seem
to
transform
the
romantic
picture
of
the
opening
scene
and
to
offer
us
a
rounded
philosophy
the
changes
however
are
more
in
expression
than
in
ultimate
substance
and
the
additions
are
chiefly
new
illustrations
of
the
ancient
theme
critics
who
study
the
of
works
of
art
help
us
to
analyze
them
more
intelligently
and
reproduce
more
accurately
what
at
various
times
may
have
been
the
intention
of
their
authors
yet
these
bits
of
information
would
be
dearly
bought
if
we
were
distracted
by
them
from
what
gives
poetic
value
and
individual
character
to
the
result
its
total
idiosyncrasy
its
place
in
the
moral
world
the
place
in
the
moral
world
of
goethe
as
a
whole
is
just
the
place
which
the
opening
scene
gave
it
in
the
beginning
it
fills
more
space
it
touches
more
historical
and
poetic
matters
but
its
centre
is
the
old
centre
and
its
result
the
old
result
it
remains
romantic
in
its
pictures
and
in
its
philosophy
the
first
addition
that
promises
to
throw
new
light
on
the
idea
of
the
drama
is
the
in
in
imitation
of
book
of
we
find
the
morning
stars
the
three
archangels
singing
together
and
then
follows
a
very
agreeable
and
humorous
conversation
between
the
lord
and
mephistopheles
the
scene
is
in
the
style
of
mediaeval
religious
plays
and
this
circumstance
might
lead
us
to
suppose
that
the
point
at
issue
was
the
salvation
of
faust
soul
but
that
in
the
literal
sense
is
far
from
being
the
case
as
in
the
question
is
what
sentiments
the
tempted
mortal
will
maintain
during
this
life
not
what
fate
will
afterwards
overtake
his
disembodied
spirit
dead
men
mephistopheles
observes
do
not
interest
him
he
is
not
a
devil
from
a
subterranean
hell
concerned
out
of
pique
or
ambition
to
increase
the
population
of
tortured
shades
in
that
fabulous
region
he
dwells
in
the
atmosphere
of
earth
he
knows
nothing
of
the
suns
or
the
worlds
the
life
of
man
is
his
element
he
remains
what
he
was
in
the
first
versions
of
the
play
a
part
of
the
one
of
its
embodiments
his
particular
office
as
we
shall
see
presently
is
to
precipitate
that
continual
destruction
which
is
involved
in
the
continual
renewal
of
life
he
finds
it
very
foolish
of
faust
to
demand
everything
and
be
satisfied
with
nothing
and
his
wager
is
that
faust
may
be
brought
to
demand
nothing
and
be
satisfied
with
what
chance
throws
in
his
way
that
he
shall
lick
the
dust
and
lick
it
with
pleasure
that
he
shall
renounce
the
dignity
of
willing
what
is
not
and
can
not
be
and
crawl
about
like
the
serpent
basking
in
the
comforts
of
the
moment
against
this
the
lord
pronounces
faust
to
be
his
servant
the
servant
that
is
of
an
ideal
and
declares
that
whoever
strives
after
an
ideal
must
needs
go
astray
yet
in
his
necessary
errors
the
good
man
never
misses
the
right
road
in
other
words
to
have
an
ideal
to
strive
for
and
like
faust
never
to
be
satisfied
is
itself
the
salvation
of
man
faust
does
not
yet
know
this
he
half
believes
there
is
some
concrete
and
ultimate
good
beyond
and
so
is
bitter
and
violent
in
his
dissatisfaction
but
in
due
season
he
will
come
to
clearness
on
this
subject
and
understand
that
only
he
deserves
freedom
and
life
who
must
daily
win
them
afresh
mephistopheles
himself
with
his
mockeries
and
seductions
helps
to
keep
the
world
moving
and
men
wide
awake
imperfection
is
all
that
is
possible
in
the
world
of
action
but
the
angels
may
gather
up
and
fix
in
thought
the
perfect
forms
approached
or
suggested
by
existence
in
the
two
earlier
versions
of
mephistopheles
appears
without
introduction
we
find
him
amusing
himself
by
giving
ambiguous
advice
to
an
innocent
scholar
and
accompanying
faust
in
his
wanderings
his
mocking
tone
and
miraculous
powers
mark
him
at
once
as
the
devil
of
the
legend
but
several
passages
prove
that
he
is
a
deputy
of
the
evoked
by
faust
in
the
beginning
that
he
should
be
both
devil
and
ought
not
to
surprise
the
learned
the
devils
of
popular
mediaeval
religion
were
not
cut
out
of
whole
cloth
they
were
simply
the
neoplatonic
demons
of
the
air
together
with
the
gods
of
olympus
and
the
more
ancient
chthonic
deities
blackened
by
sectarian
zeal
and
degraded
by
a
coarse
and
timid
imagination
many
of
these
pagan
sprites
indeed
had
been
originally
impish
and
mischievous
since
not
all
the
aspects
of
nature
are
lovely
or
propitious
nor
all
the
dreams
of
men
but
as
a
whole
they
were
without
malice
in
their
irresponsible
elemental
life
winged
powers
darting
through
space
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
they
were
not
dwellers
in
a
subterranean
hell
they
were
not
tormentors
nor
tormented
often
they
swarmed
and
sang
blithely
as
they
do
in
and
even
in
the
and
if
at
other
times
they
croaked
or
hooted
it
was
like
frogs
and
owls
less
lovely
creatures
than
but
not
less
natural
one
of
these
less
amiable
spirits
of
the
atmosphere
especially
of
its
ambient
fire
is
the
mephistopheles
of
goethe
why
he
delighted
in
evil
rather
than
in
good
he
himself
explains
in
a
profound
and
ingenious
fashion
darkness
or
nothingness
he
says
existed
alone
before
the
birth
of
light
nothingness
or
darkness
still
remains
the
fundamental
and
to
his
mind
the
better
part
of
that
mixture
of
being
and
privation
which
we
call
existence
nothing
that
exists
can
be
preserved
nor
does
it
deserve
to
be
therefore
it
would
have
been
better
if
nothing
had
ever
existed
to
deny
the
value
of
whatever
is
and
to
wish
to
destroy
it
according
to
him
is
the
only
rational
ambition
he
is
the
spirit
that
denies
continually
he
is
the
everlasting
no
this
spirit
which
we
might
compare
with
the
mars
of
lucretius
has
great
power
in
the
world
every
change
in
one
of
its
aspects
expresses
it
since
in
one
of
its
aspects
every
change
is
the
destruction
of
something
this
spirit
is
always
willing
evil
for
it
wills
death
with
all
the
folly
crime
and
despair
that
minister
to
death
but
in
willing
evil
it
is
always
accomplishing
good
for
these
evils
make
for
nothingness
and
nothingness
is
the
true
good
the
famous
couplet
teil
von
jener
stets
das
böse
will
und
stets
das
gute
schafft
is
far
from
expressing
the
hegelian
commonplace
with
which
it
is
usually
identified
it
does
not
mean
that
destruction
serves
a
good
purpose
after
all
because
it
clears
the
way
for
something
higher
mephistopheles
is
not
one
of
those
philosophers
who
think
change
and
evolution
a
good
in
themselves
he
does
not
admit
that
his
activity
while
aiming
at
evil
contributes
unintentionally
to
the
good
it
contributes
to
the
good
intentionally
because
the
evil
it
does
is
in
his
opinion
less
than
the
evil
it
cures
he
is
the
cruel
surgeon
to
the
disease
of
life
if
he
admitted
the
other
interpretation
he
would
be
converted
to
the
view
of
the
lord
in
the
his
naughtiness
would
become
in
his
own
eyes
a
needful
service
in
the
cause
of
life
a
condition
of
life
being
really
vital
and
worth
living
he
might
then
continue
his
sly
operations
and
biting
witticisms
without
one
drop
more
of
kindness
and
yet
be
sanctioned
in
everything
by
the
absolute
and
adopt
the
smile
and
halo
of
the
optimist
he
would
have
perceived
that
he
was
the
spice
of
life
the
yeast
and
red
pepper
of
the
world
necessary
to
the
perfect
savour
of
the
providential
concoction
as
it
is
mephistopheles
is
far
more
modest
he
says
that
he
wills
evil
because
what
he
wills
is
contrary
to
what
his
victims
will
he
is
the
great
contradictor
the
blaster
of
young
hopes
yet
he
does
good
because
these
young
hopes
if
let
alone
would
lead
to
misery
and
absurdity
his
contradiction
nips
the
folly
of
living
in
the
bud
to
be
sure
as
he
goes
on
to
acknowledge
the
destructive
power
never
wins
a
decisive
victory
while
everything
falls
successively
beneath
his
sickle
the
seeds
of
life
are
being
scattered
perpetually
behind
his
back
the
lucretian
venus
has
her
innings
as
well
as
the
lucretian
mars
the
eternal
the
ancient
flux
continues
without
end
and
without
abatement
thus
mephistopheles
has
a
philosophy
and
is
justified
and
consistent
in
his
own
eyes
yet
in
the
course
of
the
drama
he
wears
various
masks
and
has
various
moods
all
he
says
and
does
can
not
be
made
altogether
compatible
with
the
essence
of
his
mind
as
goethe
finally
conceived
it
the
dramatic
figure
of
mephistopheles
had
been
fixed
long
before
in
its
graphic
characteristics
mephistopheles
for
instance
is
extremely
old
he
feels
older
than
the
universe
there
is
nothing
new
for
him
he
has
no
illusions
his
feeling
for
anyone
he
sees
is
choked
as
happens
to
old
people
by
his
feelings
for
the
infinite
number
of
persons
he
remembers
he
is
heartless
because
he
is
impersonal
and
universal
he
is
altogether
inhuman
he
has
not
the
shames
nor
the
tastes
of
man
he
often
assumes
the
form
of
a
dog
it
is
his
favourite
mask
in
this
earthly
carnival
he
is
not
averse
to
the
witches
kitchen
with
its
senseless
din
and
obscenity
he
puts
up
with
the
grotesque
etiquette
of
the
observes
all
the
rules
about
signing
contracts
in
blood
knocking
thrice
and
respecting
pentagrams
why
should
he
not
dogs
and
demons
of
the
air
are
forms
of
the
as
much
as
man
man
has
no
special
dignity
that
mephistopheles
should
respect
man
morality
is
one
of
the
moralities
his
conventions
are
not
less
absurd
than
the
conventions
of
other
monkeys
mephistopheles
has
no
prejudice
against
the
snake
he
understands
and
he
despises
his
cousin
the
snake
also
he
understands
and
he
despises
himself
he
has
had
time
to
know
himself
thoroughly
his
understanding
however
is
not
impartial
because
he
is
the
advocate
of
death
he
can
not
sympathize
with
the
other
half
of
the
which
he
does
not
represent
the
creative
propulsive
enamoured
side
the
side
that
worships
the
ideal
the
love
that
makes
the
world
go
round
what
enchants
an
ingenuous
soul
can
only
amuse
mephistopheles
what
torments
it
gives
him
a
sardonic
satisfaction
thus
he
comes
to
be
in
fact
a
sour
and
mocking
devil
at
other
times
when
he
opposes
the
silliness
and
romanticism
of
faust
he
seems
to
be
the
spokesman
of
all
experience
and
reason
as
when
he
warns
faust
that
to
be
at
all
you
must
be
something
in
particular
yet
even
this
he
says
by
way
of
checking
and
denying
faust
passion
for
the
infinite
the
soberest
truth
when
unwelcome
may
seem
to
the
sentimental
as
diabolical
as
the
most
cynical
lie
so
that
in
spite
of
the
very
unequal
justness
of
his
various
sentiments
mephistopheles
retains
his
dramatic
unity
we
recognize
his
tone
and
under
whatever
mask
we
think
him
a
villain
and
find
him
delightful
such
is
the
spirit
and
such
are
the
conditions
in
which
faust
undertakes
his
adventures
he
thirsts
for
all
experience
including
all
experience
of
evil
he
fears
no
hell
and
he
hopes
for
no
happiness
he
trusts
in
magic
that
is
he
believes
or
is
willing
to
make
believe
that
apart
from
any
settled
conditions
laid
down
by
nature
or
god
personal
will
can
evoke
the
experience
it
covets
by
its
sheer
force
and
assurance
his
bond
with
mephistopheles
is
an
expression
of
this
romantic
faith
it
is
no
bargain
to
buy
pleasures
on
earth
at
the
cost
of
torments
hereafter
for
neither
goethe
nor
faust
nor
mephistopheles
believes
that
such
pleasures
are
worth
having
or
such
torments
possible
the
first
taste
faust
gets
of
the
world
is
in
auerbach
cellar
and
he
finds
it
at
once
unpalatable
his
mature
and
disdainful
mind
can
not
be
amused
by
the
sodden
merriment
he
sees
there
he
is
without
that
simplicity
and
heartiness
which
might
find
even
drunken
gaiety
attractive
to
put
up
with
such
follies
one
must
know
nothing
like
brander
or
everything
like
mephistopheles
faust
still
feels
the
pathos
of
distance
he
is
acutely
conscious
of
something
incomparably
noble
just
out
of
reach
in
the
witches
kitchen
which
he
next
visits
pleasure
is
still
more
ugly
and
shallow
here
the
din
is
even
more
nonsensical
and
the
fancy
more
obscene
yet
faust
comes
forth
with
two
points
gained
in
his
romantic
rehabilitation
he
has
taken
the
elixir
of
youth
and
he
has
seen
the
image
of
helen
in
a
mirror
he
is
henceforth
in
love
with
ideal
beauty
and
being
young
again
he
is
able
to
find
ideal
beauty
in
the
first
woman
he
sees
the
great
episode
of
gretchen
follows
and
when
he
leaves
her
after
the
duel
with
her
brother
to
view
the
wild
revels
of
the
walpurgisnacht
his
youth
for
a
moment
catches
the
contagion
of
that
orgy
his
love
of
ideal
beauty
which
remains
unsatisfied
saves
him
however
from
any
lasting
illusion
he
sees
a
little
red
mouse
running
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
nymph
he
is
pursuing
and
his
momentary
inclination
turns
to
aversion
when
he
goes
back
to
gretchen
in
her
prison
it
is
too
late
for
him
to
do
more
than
recognize
the
ruin
he
has
brought
about
gretchen
dishonoured
her
mother
poisoned
her
brother
killed
her
child
drowned
by
her
in
a
pond
and
she
herself
about
to
be
executed
gretchen
who
is
the
only
true
christian
in
this
poem
refuses
to
be
rescued
because
she
wishes
to
offer
her
voluntary
death
in
propitiation
for
her
grave
though
almost
involuntary
offences
this
is
the
end
of
faust
career
through
the
world
of
private
interests
the
little
world
and
we
may
well
ask
what
has
been
the
fruit
of
his
experiments
so
far
what
strength
or
experience
has
he
amassed
for
his
further
adventures
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
the
first
scene
of
the
second
part
where
goethe
reaches
his
highest
potency
as
a
poet
and
as
a
philosopher
we
are
transported
to
a
remote
magnificent
virgin
country
it
is
evening
and
faust
is
lying
weary
but
restless
on
a
flowering
hillside
kindly
spirits
of
nature
are
hovering
above
his
head
ariel
their
leader
bids
them
bring
solace
to
the
troubled
hero
it
is
enough
he
was
unfortunate
they
make
no
question
whether
he
was
a
saint
or
a
sinner
the
spirits
in
chorus
then
sing
four
lovely
stanzas
one
for
each
watch
of
the
night
the
first
invokes
peace
forgetfulness
surrender
to
the
healing
influence
of
sleep
pity
and
remorse
they
seem
to
say
in
the
words
of
spinoza
are
evil
and
vain
failure
is
incidental
error
is
innocent
nature
has
no
memory
forgive
yourself
and
you
are
forgiven
the
song
of
the
second
watch
merges
the
unhappy
soul
again
in
the
infinite
incorruptible
substance
of
nature
the
stars
great
or
little
twinkling
or
pure
fill
the
sky
with
their
ordered
peace
and
the
sea
with
their
trembling
reflection
in
this
universal
circulation
there
is
no
private
will
no
permanent
division
in
the
next
watch
we
find
the
plastic
stress
of
nature
beginning
to
reassert
itself
seeds
swell
sap
mounts
up
the
thawing
branches
buds
grow
full
everything
recovers
a
fresh
individuality
and
a
tender
untried
will
finally
the
song
of
the
fourth
watch
bids
the
flowers
open
their
petals
and
faust
his
eyes
forces
renewed
in
repose
should
tempt
a
new
career
nature
is
open
to
the
brave
to
the
intelligent
all
may
be
noble
who
dare
to
be
so
soothed
by
these
ministrations
faust
awakes
full
of
new
strength
and
ambition
he
watches
with
rapture
the
sunlight
touch
the
and
creep
down
gradually
into
the
valleys
when
it
reaches
him
he
turns
to
look
directly
at
the
sun
but
he
is
dazzled
he
seems
to
remember
the
that
had
once
allured
and
then
rejected
him
we
wish
he
says
to
kindle
our
torch
of
life
and
we
produce
a
conflagration
a
monstrous
medley
of
joy
and
sorrow
love
and
hate
let
us
turn
our
backs
upon
the
sun
upon
infinite
force
and
infinite
existence
fitter
for
our
eyes
the
waterfall
over
against
it
the
torrent
of
human
affairs
broken
into
a
myriad
rills
upon
the
mists
that
rise
from
it
the
sunlight
paints
a
rainbow
always
vanishing
but
always
restored
this
is
the
true
image
of
rational
human
achievement
we
have
our
life
in
the
iridescence
of
the
world
or
as
shelley
has
said
it
for
us
like
a
dome
of
glass
the
white
radiance
of
eternity
death
tramples
it
to
this
death
however
is
itself
unstable
the
lucretian
venus
by
reshaping
our
senses
and
instincts
builds
that
coloured
dome
once
more
the
rainbow
is
renewed
as
the
mists
rise
again
or
the
wind
dies
down
and
creation
is
glorious
as
on
the
first
day
this
is
goethe
theory
of
rejuvenation
and
immortality
it
is
thoroughly
naturalistic
there
is
a
life
after
death
but
only
for
such
souls
as
have
enough
scope
to
identify
themselves
with
those
forms
which
nature
in
her
uncertain
oscillations
always
tends
to
reproduce
a
deep
mind
has
deep
roots
in
nature
it
will
bloom
many
times
over
but
what
a
deep
mind
carries
over
into
its
next
incarnation
perhaps
in
some
remote
sphere
is
not
its
conventional
merits
and
demerits
its
load
of
remorse
or
its
sordid
memories
these
are
washed
away
in
its
new
baptism
what
remains
is
only
what
was
deep
in
that
deep
mind
so
deep
that
new
situations
may
again
imply
and
admit
it
when
after
the
scene
with
the
faust
thought
of
suicide
he
regarded
it
as
a
means
to
escape
from
oppressive
conditions
and
to
begin
a
fresh
life
under
conditions
wholly
different
and
unknown
it
was
as
if
a
man
in
middle
life
disgusted
with
his
profession
should
abandon
it
to
take
up
another
such
a
resolution
is
serious
it
expresses
a
great
dissatisfaction
with
things
as
they
stand
but
it
also
expresses
a
great
hope
death
for
faust
is
an
adventure
like
any
other
and
if
contrary
to
his
presumption
this
adventure
should
prove
the
last
that
too
is
a
risk
he
is
willing
to
run
accordingly
as
he
lifted
the
poison
to
his
lips
he
drank
to
the
dawn
to
a
new
springtime
of
existence
it
was
by
no
means
the
saddest
nor
the
weakest
moment
of
his
life
although
the
sound
of
an
easter
hymn
checked
him
bringing
sentimental
memories
of
a
religion
in
which
he
no
longer
believed
the
transformation
scene
he
looked
for
was
only
postponed
there
is
not
much
difference
between
dying
as
he
had
thought
to
die
and
living
as
he
was
about
to
live
venomous
essences
artificially
brewed
were
hardly
necessary
to
bring
him
to
a
new
life
the
adventures
he
was
entering
upon
were
suicidal
enough
for
he
was
to
strive
without
hope
of
attainment
and
to
proceed
by
passionate
wilfulness
or
magic
without
accepting
the
discipline
of
art
or
reason
now
at
the
close
of
the
first
part
he
has
drained
this
poisoned
life
to
the
dregs
and
the
fever
into
which
he
falls
carries
him
of
itself
into
a
new
existence
he
is
not
grown
better
or
more
reasonable
he
is
simply
starting
afresh
like
a
new
day
or
a
new
person
it
contains
however
the
fundamental
part
of
his
character
his
will
remains
wayward
but
indomitable
and
his
achievements
remain
fruitless
only
he
will
henceforth
be
romantic
on
a
broader
stage
that
of
history
and
civilization
and
his
magic
will
summon
before
him
illusions
somewhat
more
intellectual
counterfeits
of
beauty
and
of
power
his
old
loves
have
blown
over
like
the
storms
of
a
bygone
year
and
with
only
a
dreamlike
memory
of
his
past
errors
he
goes
forth
to
meet
a
new
day
among
the
allurements
which
in
the
old
legend
prompted
faust
to
sell
his
soul
to
the
devil
one
was
the
beauty
of
woman
the
poor
recluse
grown
gray
among
his
parchments
had
never
noticed
real
women
or
had
not
found
them
beautiful
pedantic
child
that
he
was
when
he
thought
of
the
beauty
of
woman
he
thought
only
of
helen
of
troy
and
helen
to
the
faust
of
the
legend
was
simply
what
venus
might
be
to
tannhäuser
a
woman
more
ravishing
than
other
ravishing
women
she
was
the
supreme
instance
of
a
vulgar
thing
the
young
goethe
however
who
was
a
poet
and
a
true
german
and
loved
with
his
soul
was
not
attracted
by
this
ideal
he
gave
his
faust
a
tenderer
love
a
love
of
the
heart
as
well
as
of
the
senses
later
also
when
goethe
took
up
the
old
legend
again
in
a
more
antiquarian
spirit
and
restored
helen
to
her
place
in
it
he
transformed
her
from
a
symbol
of
feminine
beauty
alone
into
a
symbol
for
all
beauty
and
especially
for
the
highest
beauty
that
of
hellas
the
second
love
of
faust
is
the
passion
for
classicism
this
passion
in
a
romantic
age
is
not
so
paradoxical
as
it
may
sound
winckelmann
and
the
philologians
were
restoring
something
ancient
it
was
the
romantic
passion
for
all
experience
for
the
faded
experience
of
the
ancients
also
that
made
for
them
the
poetry
and
the
charm
of
antiquity
how
dignified
everything
was
in
those
heroic
days
how
noble
serene
and
abstracted
how
pure
the
blind
eyes
of
statues
how
chaste
the
white
folds
of
the
marble
drapery
greece
was
a
remote
fascinating
vision
the
most
romantic
thing
in
the
history
of
mankind
the
sad
delicious
emotion
one
felt
before
a
ruined
temple
was
as
sentimental
as
anything
one
could
feel
before
a
ruined
castle
but
more
elegant
and
more
choice
it
was
sentimentality
in
marble
the
heroes
of
the
were
idealized
in
the
same
way
as
the
savages
of
rousseau
were
idealized
or
as
the
robbers
of
schiller
the
romantic
classicism
of
the
napoleonic
era
lies
between
the
polite
classicism
of
the
french
seventeenth
century
and
the
archaeological
classicism
of
our
present
grecians
french
classicism
had
been
quite
indifferent
to
the
picturesque
aspects
of
ancient
life
it
could
tolerate
on
the
stage
an
achilles
in
a
periwig
and
laces
what
the
french
tragedians
had
adopted
from
the
ancients
was
something
inward
a
standard
of
character
and
motive
or
a
criterion
of
taste
they
studied
harmony
and
restraint
not
because
these
had
been
greek
qualities
but
because
they
were
qualities
essentially
reasonable
and
beautiful
naturally
belonging
even
in
modern
times
to
a
cultivated
society
and
a
cultivated
poet
again
the
admiration
for
greece
which
is
common
in
our
time
among
people
of
judgement
differs
from
that
of
goethe
and
his
age
for
if
we
admire
the
artistic
expression
of
ancient
life
in
poetry
or
sculpture
we
know
that
these
manifestations
were
made
possible
by
a
long
political
and
moral
discipline
and
that
in
spite
of
that
discipline
ancient
art
remained
very
mixed
and
often
grotesque
and
impure
for
goethe
however
as
for
byron
greece
was
less
a
past
civilization
to
be
studied
scientifically
than
a
living
idea
a
summons
to
new
forms
of
art
and
of
sentiment
goethe
was
never
so
romantic
as
when
he
was
classical
his
distichs
are
like
theatrical
gestures
he
feels
the
sweep
of
his
toga
as
he
rounds
them
off
his
iphigenia
is
a
sentimental
dream
as
he
himself
came
to
feel
and
his
helena
is
an
evocation
of
magic
magical
not
merely
by
accident
and
in
the
story
but
essentially
so
in
her
ghostly
and
glassy
beauty
the
apparent
incongruities
of
the
scenes
in
which
she
appears
surrounded
by
german
knights
in
the
court
of
a
feudal
castle
are
not
real
incongruities
for
this
helen
is
not
a
thing
of
the
past
she
is
the
present
dream
and
affectation
of
things
classical
in
a
romantic
era
faust
and
his
vassals
offer
helen
the
most
chivalrous
and
exaggerated
homage
they
introduce
her
as
a
play
queen
into
their
society
faust
retires
with
her
to
arcadia
the
land
of
intentional
and
idleness
here
a
son
euphorion
is
born
to
them
a
young
genius
classic
in
aspect
but
wildly
romantic
and
ungovernable
in
temper
he
scales
the
highest
peaks
pursues
by
preference
the
nymphs
that
flee
from
him
loves
violence
and
unreason
and
finally
thinking
to
fly
falls
headlong
like
icarus
and
perishes
his
last
words
call
his
mother
after
him
and
she
follows
leaving
her
veil
and
mantle
behind
as
euphorion
had
left
his
lyre
on
the
mantle
of
helen
which
swells
into
a
cloud
faust
is
borne
back
again
to
his
native
germany
its
virtue
as
he
learns
is
to
lift
him
above
all
commonness
this
long
allegory
is
charming
enough
as
a
series
of
pictures
and
melodies
to
leave
the
reader
content
not
to
interpret
it
yet
the
intention
of
the
poet
is
clear
if
we
care
to
disentangle
it
by
going
down
into
the
bowels
of
nature
where
the
earth
goddesses
dwell
who
are
the
first
mothers
of
all
life
and
of
all
civilizations
alike
we
may
gather
intelligence
to
comprehend
even
the
most
alien
existence
greece
after
such
a
reversion
to
the
elemental
will
appear
to
us
in
her
unmatched
simplicity
and
beauty
the
vision
will
be
granted
us
although
the
object
we
see
belongs
to
a
distant
past
and
if
our
enthusiasm
like
that
of
faust
is
passionate
and
indomitable
we
may
actually
persuade
the
queen
of
the
dead
to
yield
up
helen
that
we
may
wed
her
our
scholarship
and
philosophy
our
faithful
imitation
of
greek
art
and
literature
may
actually
render
the
greek
scene
familiar
to
us
yet
the
setting
of
this
recovered
genius
will
still
be
modern
it
will
become
half
modern
itself
we
shall
have
to
teach
helen
to
rhyme
the
product
of
this
hybrid
inspiration
will
be
a
romantic
soul
in
the
garb
of
classicism
a
lovely
wild
thing
fated
to
die
young
when
this
enthusiasm
has
dashed
itself
against
the
hard
conditions
of
life
the
beauty
of
greece
that
was
its
mother
will
also
pale
before
our
eyes
we
shall
be
perforce
content
to
let
it
return
to
the
realm
of
irrevocable
past
things
only
its
garment
the
monuments
of
its
art
and
thought
will
remain
to
raise
us
if
we
have
loved
them
above
all
vulgarity
in
taste
and
in
moral
allegiance
it
is
an
evidence
of
goethe
great
wisdom
that
he
felt
that
romantic
classicism
must
be
subordinated
or
abandoned
that
helen
must
evaporate
while
faust
returned
to
germany
and
to
the
feeling
that
after
all
gretchen
was
his
true
love
at
the
same
time
the
issue
of
this
wonderful
episode
is
a
little
disappointing
at
the
beginning
the
vision
of
helen
in
a
mirror
had
inspired
faust
with
renewed
enthusiasm
the
sight
of
her
again
in
the
magic
play
had
altogether
enraptured
and
overwhelmed
him
and
this
inspiration
had
come
just
when
after
the
death
of
gretchen
he
had
resolved
to
pursue
not
all
experience
as
at
first
but
rather
the
best
experience
a
hint
that
the
transformations
of
faust
will
were
expected
somehow
to
constitute
a
real
progress
there
was
indeed
among
mortals
such
an
infinite
need
of
this
incomparable
and
symbolic
helen
that
it
could
move
the
very
guardians
of
the
dead
to
mercy
and
to
tears
when
we
remember
all
this
we
have
some
reason
to
expect
that
a
great
and
permanent
improvement
in
the
life
and
heart
of
our
hero
should
follow
on
his
obtaining
so
rare
a
boon
but
to
live
within
arcadia
helen
was
not
needed
any
phyllis
would
have
served
helen
to
be
sure
leaves
some
relics
behind
by
which
we
may
understand
that
the
influence
of
greek
history
literature
and
sculpture
may
still
avail
to
cultivate
the
mind
and
give
it
an
air
of
distinction
perhaps
in
the
commonwealth
he
is
about
to
found
faust
would
wish
to
establish
not
only
dykes
and
freedom
but
also
professorships
of
greek
and
archaeological
museums
and
the
lyre
of
euphorion
which
is
also
left
us
may
signify
that
poems
like
byron
of
urn
die
götter
of
schiller
and
goethe
own
classical
pieces
will
continue
to
enrich
european
literature
this
is
something
but
not
enough
to
lift
faust
immense
enthusiasm
for
helen
above
a
crass
illusion
that
dream
of
a
perfect
beauty
to
be
achieved
of
a
perfect
life
to
be
lived
according
to
nature
and
reason
would
have
ended
in
a
little
scholarship
and
a
little
pedantry
faust
would
have
won
helen
in
order
to
hand
her
over
to
wagner
helen
was
queen
of
sparta
and
although
of
course
the
doric
sparta
of
lycurgus
was
something
much
later
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sparta
of
homer
yet
taken
symbolically
it
is
the
happiest
accident
that
helen
the
type
of
greek
perfection
in
beauty
should
have
been
queen
of
sparta
the
type
of
greek
perfection
in
discipline
a
faust
that
had
truly
deserved
and
understood
helen
would
have
built
her
an
hellenic
city
he
would
have
become
himself
an
a
master
of
men
one
of
those
poets
in
things
those
shapers
of
generations
and
wise
laws
of
which
plato
speaks
contrasting
them
with
homer
and
other
poets
in
words
only
for
the
beauty
of
mind
and
body
that
fascinates
the
romantic
classicist
and
which
inspired
the
ancient
poets
themselves
was
not
a
product
of
idleness
and
sentimentality
nor
of
material
and
forced
activity
it
was
a
product
of
orderly
war
religion
gymnastics
and
deliberate
the
next
turn
in
faust
fortunes
actually
finds
him
a
trader
a
statesman
an
and
if
such
a
rolling
stone
could
gather
any
moss
we
should
expect
to
see
here
if
anywhere
the
fruits
of
that
aesthetic
education
of
mankind
which
helen
represented
we
should
expect
faust
who
had
lain
in
the
lap
of
absolute
beauty
to
understand
its
nature
we
should
expect
him
in
eager
search
after
perfection
to
establish
his
state
on
the
distinction
between
the
better
and
the
worse
a
distinction
never
to
be
abolished
or
obscured
for
one
who
has
loved
beauty
in
other
words
he
might
have
established
a
moral
society
founding
it
on
great
renunciations
and
on
enlightened
heroisms
so
that
the
highest
beauty
might
really
come
down
and
dwell
within
that
city
but
we
find
nothing
of
the
sort
faust
founds
his
kingdom
because
he
must
do
something
and
his
only
ideal
of
what
he
hopes
to
secure
for
his
subjects
is
that
they
shall
always
have
something
to
do
thus
the
will
to
live
in
faust
is
not
in
the
least
educated
by
his
experience
it
changes
its
objects
because
it
must
the
passions
of
youth
yield
to
those
of
age
and
among
all
the
illusions
of
his
life
the
most
fatuous
is
the
illusion
of
progress
it
is
characteristic
of
the
absolute
romantic
spirit
that
when
it
has
finished
with
something
it
must
invent
a
new
interest
it
beats
the
bush
for
fresh
game
it
is
always
on
the
verge
of
being
utterly
bored
so
now
that
helen
is
flown
mephistopheles
must
come
to
the
rescue
like
an
amiable
nurse
and
propose
all
sorts
of
pastimes
frankfort
leipzig
paris
versailles
are
described
with
the
entertainments
that
life
there
might
afford
but
faust
who
was
always
has
been
rendered
more
so
by
his
recent
splendid
adventures
however
a
new
impulse
suddenly
arises
in
his
breast
from
the
to
which
helen
mantle
has
borne
him
he
can
see
the
german
ocean
with
its
tides
daily
covering
great
stretches
of
the
flat
shore
and
rendering
them
brackish
and
uninhabitable
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
reclaim
those
wastes
to
plant
there
a
prosperous
population
after
greece
faust
has
a
vision
of
holland
this
last
ambition
of
faust
is
as
romantic
as
the
others
he
feels
the
prompting
towards
political
art
as
he
had
felt
the
prompting
towards
love
or
beauty
the
notion
of
transforming
things
by
his
will
of
leaving
for
ages
his
mark
upon
nature
and
upon
human
society
fascinates
him
but
this
passion
for
activity
and
power
which
some
commentators
dignify
with
the
name
of
altruism
and
of
living
for
others
has
no
steady
purpose
or
standard
about
it
goethe
is
especially
lavish
in
details
to
prove
this
point
magic
the
exercise
of
an
unteachable
will
is
still
faust
instrument
mephistopheles
by
various
arts
of
illusion
secures
the
triumph
of
the
emperor
in
a
desperate
war
which
he
is
carrying
on
against
a
justifiable
insurrection
as
a
reward
for
the
aid
rendered
faust
receives
the
shore
marches
in
fief
the
necessary
dykes
and
canals
are
built
by
magic
the
spirits
that
mephistopheles
commands
dig
and
build
them
with
strange
incantations
the
commerce
that
springs
up
is
also
illegitimate
piracy
is
involved
in
it
nor
is
this
all
on
some
that
diversified
the
original
beach
an
old
man
and
his
wife
philemon
and
baucis
lived
before
the
advent
of
faust
and
his
improvements
on
the
hillock
besides
their
cottage
there
stood
a
small
chapel
with
a
bell
which
disturbed
faust
in
his
newly
built
palace
partly
by
its
importunate
sound
partly
by
its
christian
suggestions
and
partly
by
reminding
him
that
he
was
not
master
of
the
country
altogether
and
that
something
existed
in
it
not
the
product
of
his
magical
will
the
old
people
would
not
sell
out
and
in
a
fit
of
impatience
faust
orders
that
they
should
be
evicted
by
force
and
transferred
to
a
better
dwelling
elsewhere
mephistopheles
and
his
minions
execute
these
orders
somewhat
roughly
the
cottage
and
chapel
are
set
on
fire
and
philemon
and
baucis
are
consumed
in
the
flames
or
buried
in
the
ruins
faust
regrets
this
accident
but
it
is
one
of
those
inevitable
developments
of
action
which
a
brave
man
must
face
and
forget
as
soon
as
possible
he
had
regretted
in
the
same
way
the
unhappiness
of
gretchen
and
presumably
the
death
of
euphorion
but
such
is
romantic
life
his
will
though
shaken
is
not
extinguished
by
such
misadventures
he
would
continue
if
life
could
last
doing
things
that
in
some
respect
he
would
be
obliged
to
regret
but
he
would
banish
that
regret
easily
in
the
pursuit
of
some
new
interest
and
on
the
whole
he
would
not
regret
having
been
obliged
to
regret
them
otherwise
he
would
not
have
shared
the
whole
experience
of
mankind
but
missed
the
important
experience
of
and
of
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
the
citizens
he
is
establishing
behind
leaky
dykes
so
that
they
may
always
have
something
to
keep
them
busy
would
have
given
him
unmixed
satisfaction
if
he
could
really
have
foreseen
their
career
in
its
concrete
details
holland
is
an
interesting
country
but
hardly
a
spectacle
which
would
long
entrance
an
idealist
like
faust
so
exacting
that
he
has
found
the
arts
and
sciences
wholly
vain
domesticity
impossible
and
kitchens
and
beneath
consideration
the
career
of
faust
himself
had
been
far
more
free
and
active
than
that
of
his
industrious
burghers
could
ever
hope
to
be
his
interest
in
establishing
them
is
a
masterful
irresponsible
interest
it
is
one
more
arbitrary
passion
one
more
selfish
illusion
as
he
had
no
conscience
in
his
love
and
sought
and
secured
happiness
so
he
has
no
conscience
in
his
ambition
and
in
his
political
architecture
but
if
only
his
will
is
done
he
does
not
ask
whether
judged
by
its
fruits
it
will
be
worth
doing
as
his
immense
dejection
at
the
beginning
when
he
was
a
doctor
in
his
laboratory
was
not
founded
on
any
real
misfortune
but
on
restlessness
and
a
vague
infinite
ambition
so
his
ultimate
satisfaction
in
his
work
is
not
founded
on
any
good
done
but
on
a
passionate
wilfulness
he
calls
the
thing
he
wants
for
others
good
because
he
now
wants
to
bestow
it
on
them
not
because
they
naturally
want
it
for
themselves
incapable
of
sympathy
he
has
a
momentary
pleasure
in
policy
and
in
the
last
and
highest
expression
of
his
will
in
his
statesmanship
and
supposed
public
spirit
he
remains
romantic
and
if
need
be
aggressive
and
criminal
meantime
his
end
is
approaching
the
smoke
from
that
poor
little
conflagration
turns
into
of
want
guilt
care
and
death
which
come
and
hover
about
him
want
is
kept
off
by
his
wealth
and
guilt
is
transcended
by
his
romantic
courage
but
care
slips
through
the
keyhole
breathes
upon
him
and
blinds
him
while
death
though
he
does
not
see
it
follows
close
upon
his
heels
nevertheless
the
old
man
faust
is
in
his
hundredth
year
is
undaunted
and
all
his
thoughts
are
intent
on
the
future
on
the
work
to
which
he
has
set
his
hand
he
orders
the
digging
to
proceed
on
the
canals
he
is
building
but
the
spirits
that
seem
to
obey
him
are
getting
out
of
hand
and
dig
his
grave
instead
when
he
feels
death
upon
him
faust
has
one
of
his
most
splendid
moments
of
he
has
stormed
through
the
world
he
says
taking
with
equal
thanks
the
buffets
and
rewards
of
fortune
and
the
last
word
of
wisdom
he
has
learned
is
that
no
man
deserves
life
or
freedom
who
does
not
daily
win
them
anew
he
will
leave
the
dykes
he
has
thrown
up
against
the
sea
to
protect
the
nation
he
has
established
a
symbol
that
their
health
and
freedom
must
consist
in
perpetual
striving
against
an
indomitable
foe
the
thought
of
many
generations
living
in
that
wholesome
danger
and
labour
fills
him
with
satisfaction
he
could
almost
say
to
this
moment
in
which
that
prospect
opens
before
his
mind
eye
stay
thou
art
so
fair
and
with
these
words
a
last
challenge
and
mock
surrender
to
mephistopheles
he
sinks
into
the
grave
open
at
his
feet
who
has
won
the
wager
faust
has
almost
though
not
quite
pronounced
the
words
which
were
to
give
mephistopheles
the
victory
but
the
sense
of
them
is
new
and
mephistopheles
has
not
succeeded
in
making
faust
surrender
his
will
to
will
his
indefinite
idealism
since
what
satisfies
faust
is
merely
the
consciousness
that
this
will
to
will
is
to
be
maintained
and
that
neither
he
nor
the
colonists
he
has
brought
into
being
will
ever
lick
the
dust
and
take
comfort
without
any
further
aspiration
in
the
chance
pleasures
of
the
moment
faust
has
maintained
his
enthusiasm
for
a
stormy
difficult
and
endless
life
he
has
been
true
to
his
romantic
philosophy
he
is
therefore
saved
in
the
sense
in
which
salvation
is
defined
in
the
in
and
presently
again
in
the
song
of
the
angels
that
receive
his
soul
when
they
say
whosoever
is
unflagging
in
his
striving
for
ever
him
we
can
redeem
this
salvation
does
not
hang
on
any
improvement
in
faust
character
he
was
sinful
to
the
end
and
had
been
god
unwitting
servant
from
the
very
beginning
nor
does
it
lie
in
any
revolution
in
his
fortunes
as
if
in
heaven
he
were
to
be
differently
employed
than
on
earth
he
is
going
to
teach
life
to
the
souls
of
young
boys
who
have
died
too
soon
to
have
had
in
their
own
persons
any
experience
of
rathskellers
gretchens
helens
and
walpurgisnachts
teaching
though
not
exactly
in
these
subjects
had
been
doctor
faustus
original
profession
and
the
weariness
of
it
was
what
had
driven
him
to
magic
and
almost
to
suicide
until
he
had
escaped
into
the
great
world
of
adventure
outside
certainly
with
his
new
pupils
he
will
not
be
more
content
his
romantic
restlessness
will
not
forsake
him
in
heaven
some
fine
day
he
will
throw
his
celestial
out
of
the
window
and
with
his
pupils
after
him
go
forth
to
taste
life
in
some
windier
region
of
the
clouds
no
faust
is
not
saved
in
the
sense
of
being
sanctified
or
brought
to
a
final
eternal
state
of
bliss
the
only
improvement
in
his
nature
has
been
that
he
has
passed
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
from
private
to
public
activities
if
at
the
end
of
this
part
he
expresses
a
wish
to
abandon
magic
and
to
live
like
a
man
among
men
in
the
bosom
of
real
nature
that
wish
remains
merely
platonic
it
is
a
thought
that
visited
goethe
often
during
his
long
career
that
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
accept
life
under
natural
conditions
rather
than
to
pretend
to
evoke
the
conditions
of
life
out
of
the
will
to
live
this
thought
were
it
held
steadfastly
would
constitute
an
advance
from
transcendentalism
to
naturalism
but
the
spirit
of
nature
is
itself
romantic
it
lives
spontaneously
bravely
without
premeditation
and
for
the
sake
of
living
rather
than
of
enjoying
or
attaining
anything
final
and
under
natural
conditions
the
vicissitudes
of
an
endless
life
would
be
many
and
there
could
be
no
question
of
an
ultimate
goal
nor
even
of
an
endless
progress
in
any
particular
direction
the
veering
of
life
is
part
of
its
vitality
it
is
essential
to
romantic
irony
and
to
romantic
pluck
the
secret
of
what
is
serious
in
the
moral
of
is
to
be
looked
for
in
spinoza
the
source
of
what
is
serious
in
the
philosophy
of
goethe
spinoza
has
an
admirable
doctrine
or
rather
insight
which
he
calls
seeing
things
under
the
form
of
eternity
this
faculty
is
fundamental
in
the
human
mind
ordinary
perception
and
memory
are
cases
of
it
therefore
when
we
use
it
to
deal
with
ultimate
issues
we
are
not
alienated
from
experience
but
on
the
contrary
endowed
with
experience
and
with
its
fruits
a
thing
is
seen
under
the
form
of
eternity
when
all
its
parts
or
stages
are
conceived
in
their
true
relations
and
thereby
conceived
together
the
complete
biography
of
caesar
is
caesar
seen
under
the
form
of
eternity
now
the
complete
biography
of
faust
faust
seen
under
the
form
of
eternity
shows
forth
his
salvation
god
and
faust
himself
in
his
last
moment
of
insight
see
that
to
have
led
such
a
life
in
such
a
spirit
to
be
saved
it
was
to
be
the
sort
of
man
a
man
should
be
the
blots
on
that
life
were
helpful
and
necessary
blots
the
passions
of
it
were
necessary
and
creative
passions
to
have
felt
such
perpetual
dissatisfaction
is
truly
satisfactory
such
desire
for
universal
experience
is
the
right
experience
you
are
saved
in
that
you
lived
well
saved
not
after
you
have
stopped
living
well
but
during
the
whole
process
your
destiny
has
been
to
be
the
servant
of
god
that
god
and
your
own
conscience
should
pronounce
this
sentence
is
your
true
salvation
your
worthiness
is
thereby
established
under
the
form
of
eternity
the
play
in
its
philosophic
development
ends
here
but
goethe
added
several
more
details
and
scenes
with
that
abundance
that
love
of
symbolic
pictures
and
poetic
epigrams
which
characterizes
the
whole
second
part
as
faust
expires
or
rather
before
he
does
so
mephistopheles
posts
one
of
his
little
demons
at
each
aperture
of
the
hero
body
lest
the
soul
should
slip
out
without
being
caught
at
the
same
time
a
bevy
of
angels
descends
scattering
the
red
roses
of
love
and
singing
its
praises
these
roses
if
they
touch
mephistopheles
and
his
demons
turn
to
balls
of
fire
and
although
fire
is
their
familiar
element
they
are
scorched
and
scared
away
the
angels
are
thus
enabled
to
catch
the
soul
of
faust
at
their
leisure
and
bear
it
away
triumphantly
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
fight
of
little
boys
over
a
fluttering
butterfly
can
not
be
what
really
determines
the
issue
of
the
wager
and
the
salvation
of
faust
but
goethe
in
his
conversations
with
eckermann
justifies
this
intervention
of
a
sort
of
mechanical
accident
by
the
analogy
of
christian
doctrine
grace
is
needed
besides
virtue
and
the
intercession
of
gretchen
and
the
virgin
mary
like
that
of
the
virgin
mary
lucia
and
beatrice
in
dante
case
and
the
stratagem
of
the
balls
of
fire
all
stand
for
this
external
condition
of
salvation
this
intervention
of
grace
is
at
bottom
only
a
new
symbol
for
the
essential
justification
under
the
form
of
eternity
of
what
is
imperfect
and
insufficient
in
time
the
chequered
and
wilful
life
of
faust
is
not
righteous
in
any
of
its
parts
yet
righteousness
is
imputed
to
it
as
a
whole
divine
love
accepts
it
as
sufficient
speculative
reason
declares
that
to
be
the
best
possible
life
which
to
humdrum
understanding
seems
a
series
of
faults
and
of
failures
if
the
foretaste
of
his
new
holland
fills
from
a
distance
the
dying
faust
with
satisfaction
how
much
more
must
the
wonderful
career
of
faust
himself
deserve
to
be
accepted
and
envied
and
proclaimed
to
be
its
own
excuse
for
being
the
faults
of
faust
in
time
are
not
counted
against
him
in
eternity
his
crimes
and
follies
were
blessings
in
disguise
did
they
not
render
his
life
interesting
and
fit
to
make
a
poem
of
was
it
not
by
falling
into
them
and
rising
out
of
them
that
faust
was
faust
at
all
this
insight
is
the
higher
reason
the
divine
love
supervening
to
save
him
what
ought
to
be
imperfect
in
time
is
i
because
of
its
very
imperfection
there
perfect
when
i
viewed
under
the
form
of
eternity
to
live
to
live
just
as
we
do
that
if
we
could
only
realize
it
is
the
purpose
and
the
crown
of
living
we
must
seek
improvement
we
must
be
dissatisfied
with
ourselves
that
is
the
appointed
attitude
the
histrionic
pose
that
is
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
but
while
we
feel
this
dissatisfaction
we
are
perfectly
satisfactory
and
while
we
play
our
game
and
constantly
lose
it
we
are
winning
the
game
for
god
even
this
scene
however
did
not
satisfy
the
prolific
fancy
of
the
poet
and
he
added
a
final
one
the
apotheosis
or
of
faust
in
the
campo
santo
at
pisa
goethe
had
seen
a
fresco
representing
various
anchorites
dwelling
on
the
flanks
of
some
sacred
mountain
sinai
carmel
or
athos
each
in
his
little
cave
or
hermitage
and
above
them
in
the
large
space
of
sky
flights
of
angels
were
seen
rising
towards
the
madonna
through
such
a
landscape
the
poet
now
shows
us
the
soul
of
faust
carried
slowly
upwards
this
scene
has
been
regarded
as
inspired
by
catholic
ideas
whereas
the
in
was
biblical
and
protestant
and
goethe
himself
says
that
his
poetic
intention
could
best
be
rendered
by
images
borrowed
from
the
tradition
of
the
mediaeval
church
but
in
truth
there
is
nothing
catholic
about
the
scene
except
the
names
or
titles
of
the
personages
what
they
say
is
all
sentimental
or
vague
mysticism
such
as
might
go
with
any
somewhat
nebulous
piety
and
much
is
actually
borrowed
from
swedenborg
what
is
swedenborgian
however
such
as
the
notion
of
heavenly
instruction
passage
from
sphere
to
sphere
and
looking
through
other
people
eyes
is
in
turn
a
mere
form
of
expression
the
poetic
intention
of
the
author
is
as
we
have
seen
altogether
spinozitic
undoubtedly
he
conceives
that
the
soul
of
faust
is
to
pass
in
another
world
through
some
new
series
of
experiences
but
that
destiny
is
not
his
salvation
it
is
the
continuance
of
his
trial
the
famous
chorus
at
the
very
end
repeats
with
an
interesting
variation
the
same
contrast
we
have
seen
before
between
the
point
of
view
of
time
and
that
of
eternity
everything
transitory
says
the
mystic
chorus
is
only
an
image
here
that
is
under
the
form
of
eternity
the
insufficient
is
turned
into
something
actual
and
complete
and
what
seemed
in
experience
an
endless
pursuit
becomes
to
speculation
a
perfect
fulfilment
the
ideal
of
something
infinitely
attractive
and
essentially
inexhaustible
the
eternal
feminine
as
goethe
calls
it
draws
life
on
from
stage
to
stage
gretchen
and
helen
had
been
symbols
of
this
ideal
goethe
green
old
age
had
felt
to
the
very
last
the
charm
of
woman
the
sweetness
and
the
sorrow
of
loving
what
he
could
not
hope
to
possess
and
what
in
its
ideal
perfection
necessarily
eludes
possession
he
had
reconciled
himself
not
without
tears
to
this
desire
without
hope
and
like
piccarda
in
the
he
had
blessed
the
hand
that
gave
the
passion
and
denied
the
happiness
thus
in
dreaming
of
one
satisfaction
and
renouncing
it
he
had
found
a
satisfaction
of
another
kind
ends
on
the
same
philosophical
level
on
which
it
began
the
level
of
romanticism
the
worth
of
life
lies
in
pursuit
not
in
attainment
therefore
everything
is
worth
pursuing
and
nothing
brings
satisfaction
save
this
endless
destiny
itself
such
is
the
official
moral
of
and
what
we
may
call
its
general
philosophy
but
as
we
saw
just
now
this
moral
is
only
an
afterthought
and
is
far
from
exhausting
the
philosophic
ideas
which
the
poem
contains
here
is
a
scheme
for
experience
but
experience
in
filling
it
out
opens
up
many
vistas
and
some
of
these
reveal
deeper
and
higher
things
than
experience
itself
the
path
of
the
pilgrim
and
the
inns
he
stops
at
are
neither
the
whole
landscape
he
sees
as
he
travels
nor
the
true
shrine
he
is
making
for
and
the
incidental
philosophy
or
philosophies
of
goethe
are
to
my
mind
often
better
than
its
ultimate
philosophy
the
first
scene
of
the
second
part
for
instance
is
better
poetically
and
philosophically
than
the
last
it
shows
a
deeper
sense
for
the
realities
of
nature
and
of
the
soul
and
it
is
more
sincere
goethe
there
is
interpreting
nature
with
spinoza
he
is
not
dreaming
with
swedenborg
nor
talking
equivocal
paradoxes
with
hegel
in
fact
the
great
merit
of
the
romantic
attitude
in
poetry
and
of
the
transcendental
method
in
philosophy
is
that
they
put
us
back
at
the
beginning
of
our
experience
they
disintegrate
convention
which
is
often
cumbrous
and
confused
and
restore
us
to
ourselves
to
immediate
perception
and
primordial
will
that
as
it
would
seem
is
the
true
and
inevitable
had
we
not
been
born
had
we
not
peeped
into
this
world
each
out
of
his
personal
eggshell
this
world
might
indeed
have
existed
without
us
as
a
thousand
undiscoverable
worlds
may
now
exist
but
for
us
it
would
not
have
existed
this
obvious
truth
would
not
need
to
be
insisted
on
but
for
two
reasons
one
that
conventional
knowledge
such
as
our
notions
of
science
and
morality
afford
is
often
asserts
and
imposes
on
us
much
more
than
our
experience
warrants
our
experience
which
is
our
only
approach
to
reality
the
other
reason
is
the
reverse
or
counterpart
of
this
for
conventional
knowledge
often
ignores
and
seems
to
suppress
parts
of
experience
no
less
actual
and
important
for
us
as
those
parts
on
which
the
conventional
knowledge
itself
is
reared
the
public
world
is
too
narrow
for
the
soul
as
well
as
too
mythical
and
fabulous
hence
the
double
critical
labour
and
reawakening
which
romantic
reflection
is
good
for
to
cut
off
the
dead
branches
and
feed
the
starving
shoots
this
philosophy
as
kant
said
is
a
cathartic
it
is
purgative
and
liberating
it
is
intended
to
make
us
start
afresh
and
start
right
it
follows
that
one
who
has
no
sympathy
with
such
a
philosophy
is
a
comparatively
conventional
person
he
has
a
mind
faust
has
a
mind
a
truly
free
sincere
courageous
soul
it
follows
also
however
that
one
who
has
no
philosophy
but
this
has
no
wisdom
he
can
say
nothing
that
is
worth
carrying
away
everything
in
him
is
attitude
and
nothing
is
achievement
faust
and
especially
mephistopheles
do
have
other
philosophies
on
top
of
their
transcendentalism
for
this
is
only
a
method
to
be
used
in
reaching
conclusions
that
shall
be
critically
safeguarded
and
empirically
grounded
such
outlooks
such
vistas
into
nature
are
scattered
liberally
through
the
pages
of
words
of
wisdom
diversify
this
career
of
folly
as
exquisite
scenes
fill
this
tortuous
and
overloaded
drama
the
mind
has
become
free
and
sincere
but
it
has
remained
bewildered
the
literary
merits
of
goethe
correspond
accurately
with
its
philosophical
excellences
in
the
prologue
in
the
theatre
goethe
himself
has
described
them
much
scenery
much
wisdom
some
folly
great
wealth
of
incident
and
characterization
and
behind
the
soul
of
a
poet
singing
with
all
sincerity
and
fervour
the
visions
of
his
life
here
is
profundity
inwardness
honesty
waywardness
here
are
the
most
touching
accents
of
nature
and
the
most
varied
assortment
of
curious
lore
and
grotesque
fancies
this
work
says
goethe
in
a
quatrain
intended
as
an
epilogue
but
not
ultimately
inserted
in
the
play
this
work
is
like
human
life
it
has
a
beginning
it
has
an
end
but
it
has
no
totality
it
is
not
one
whole
how
indeed
should
we
draw
the
sum
of
an
infinite
experience
that
is
without
conditions
to
determine
it
and
without
goals
in
which
it
terminates
evidently
all
a
poet
of
pure
experience
can
do
is
to
represent
some
snatches
of
it
more
or
less
prolonged
and
the
more
prolonged
the
experience
represented
is
the
more
it
will
be
a
collection
of
snatches
and
the
less
the
last
part
of
it
will
have
to
do
with
the
beginning
any
character
which
we
may
attribute
to
the
whole
of
what
we
have
surveyed
would
fail
to
dominate
it
if
that
whole
had
been
larger
and
if
we
had
had
memory
or
foresight
enough
to
include
other
parts
of
experience
differing
altogether
in
kind
from
the
episodes
we
happen
to
have
lived
through
to
be
miscellaneous
to
be
indefinite
to
be
unfinished
is
essential
to
the
romantic
life
may
we
not
say
that
it
is
essential
to
all
life
in
its
immediacy
and
that
only
in
reference
to
what
is
not
life
to
objects
ideals
and
unanimities
that
can
not
be
experienced
but
may
only
be
conceived
can
life
become
rational
and
truly
progressive
herein
we
may
see
the
radical
and
inalienable
excellence
of
romanticism
its
sincerity
freedom
richness
and
infinity
herein
too
we
may
see
its
limitations
in
that
it
can
not
fix
or
trust
any
of
its
ideals
and
blindly
believes
the
universe
to
be
as
wayward
as
itself
so
that
nature
and
art
are
always
slipping
through
its
fingers
it
is
obstinately
empirical
and
will
never
learn
anything

v
conclusion
it
may
be
possible
after
studying
these
three
philosophical
poets
to
establish
some
comparison
between
them
by
a
comparison
is
not
meant
a
discussion
as
to
which
of
our
poets
is
the
best
each
is
the
best
in
his
way
and
none
is
the
best
in
every
way
to
express
a
preference
is
not
so
much
a
criticism
as
a
personal
confession
if
it
were
a
question
of
the
relative
pleasure
a
man
might
get
from
each
poet
in
turn
this
pleasure
would
differ
according
to
the
man
temperament
his
period
of
life
the
language
he
knew
best
and
the
doctrine
that
was
most
familiar
to
him
by
a
comparison
is
meant
a
review
of
the
analysis
we
have
already
made
of
the
type
of
imagination
and
philosophy
embodied
in
each
of
the
poets
to
see
what
they
have
in
common
how
they
differ
or
what
order
they
will
fall
into
from
different
points
of
view
thus
we
have
just
seen
that
goethe
in
his
presents
experience
in
its
immediacy
variety
and
apparent
groundlessness
and
that
he
presents
it
as
an
episode
before
and
after
which
other
episodes
differing
from
it
more
and
more
as
you
recede
may
be
conceived
to
come
there
is
no
possible
totality
in
this
for
there
is
no
known
ground
turn
to
lucretius
and
the
difference
is
striking
lucretius
is
the
poet
of
substance
the
ground
is
what
he
sees
everywhere
and
by
seeing
the
ground
he
sees
also
the
possible
products
of
it
experience
appears
in
lucretius
not
as
each
man
comes
upon
it
in
his
own
person
but
as
the
scientific
observer
views
it
from
without
experience
for
him
is
a
natural
inevitable
monotonous
round
of
feelings
involved
in
the
operations
of
nature
the
ground
and
the
limits
of
experience
have
become
evident
together
in
dante
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
view
of
experience
also
in
its
totality
also
from
above
and
in
a
sense
from
outside
but
the
external
point
of
reference
is
moral
not
physical
and
what
interests
the
poet
is
what
experience
is
best
what
processes
lead
to
a
supreme
indestructible
sort
of
existence
goethe
is
the
poet
of
life
lucretius
the
poet
of
nature
dante
the
poet
of
salvation
goethe
gives
us
what
is
most
fundamental
the
turbid
flux
of
sense
the
cry
of
the
heart
the
first
tentative
notions
of
art
and
science
which
magic
or
shrewdness
might
hit
upon
lucretius
carries
us
one
step
farther
our
wisdom
ceases
to
be
impressionistic
and
casual
it
rests
on
understanding
of
things
so
that
what
happiness
remains
to
us
does
not
deceive
us
and
we
can
possess
it
in
dignity
and
peace
knowledge
of
what
is
possible
is
the
beginning
of
happiness
dante
however
carries
us
much
farther
than
that
he
too
has
knowledge
of
what
is
possible
and
impossible
he
has
collected
the
precepts
of
old
philosophers
and
saints
and
the
more
recent
examples
patent
in
society
around
him
and
by
their
help
has
distinguished
the
ambitions
that
may
be
wisely
indulged
in
this
life
from
those
which
it
is
madness
to
foster
the
first
being
called
virtue
and
piety
and
the
second
folly
and
sin
what
makes
such
knowledge
precious
is
not
only
that
it
sketches
in
general
the
scope
and
issue
of
life
but
that
it
paints
in
the
detail
as
well
the
detail
of
what
is
possible
no
less
than
that
more
familiar
to
tragic
poets
of
what
is
impossible
lucretius
notion
for
instance
of
what
is
positively
worth
while
or
attainable
is
very
meagre
freedom
from
superstition
with
so
much
natural
science
as
may
secure
that
freedom
friendship
and
a
few
cheap
and
healthful
animal
pleasures
no
love
no
patriotism
no
enterprise
no
religion
so
too
in
what
is
forbidden
us
lucretius
sees
only
generalities
the
folly
of
passion
the
blight
of
superstition
dante
on
the
contrary
sees
the
various
pitfalls
of
life
with
intense
distinctness
and
seeing
them
clearly
and
how
fatal
each
is
he
sees
also
why
men
fall
into
them
the
dream
that
leads
men
astray
and
the
sweetness
of
those
goods
that
are
impossible
feeling
even
in
what
we
must
ultimately
call
evil
the
soul
of
good
that
attracts
us
to
it
he
feels
in
good
all
its
loveliness
and
variety
where
except
in
dante
can
we
find
so
many
stars
that
differ
from
other
stars
in
glory
so
many
delightful
habitations
for
excellences
so
many
distinct
beauties
of
form
accent
thought
and
intention
so
many
delicacies
and
heroisms
dante
is
the
master
of
those
who
know
by
experience
what
is
worth
knowing
by
experience
he
is
the
master
of
here
then
are
our
three
poets
and
their
messages
goethe
with
human
life
in
its
immediacy
treated
romantically
lucretius
with
a
vision
of
nature
and
of
the
limits
of
human
life
dante
with
spiritual
mastery
of
that
life
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
you
may
stop
at
what
stage
you
will
according
to
your
sense
of
what
is
real
and
important
for
what
one
man
calls
higher
another
man
calls
unreal
and
what
one
man
feels
to
be
strength
smells
rank
to
another
in
the
end
we
should
not
be
satisfied
with
any
one
of
our
poets
if
we
had
to
drop
the
other
two
it
is
true
that
taken
formally
and
in
respect
to
their
type
of
philosophy
and
imagination
dante
is
on
a
higher
plane
than
lucretius
and
lucretius
on
a
higher
plane
than
goethe
but
the
plane
on
which
a
poet
dwells
is
not
everything
much
depends
on
what
he
brings
up
with
him
to
that
level
now
there
is
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
in
goethe
that
lucretius
does
not
know
of
not
knowing
of
it
lucretius
can
not
carry
this
fund
of
experience
up
to
the
intellectual
and
naturalistic
level
he
can
not
transmute
this
abundant
substance
of
goethe
by
his
higher
insight
and
clearer
faith
he
has
not
woven
so
much
into
his
poem
so
that
while
to
see
nature
as
lucretius
sees
it
is
a
greater
feat
than
merely
to
live
hard
in
a
romantic
fashion
and
produces
a
purer
and
more
exalted
poem
than
goethe
magical
medley
yet
this
medley
is
full
of
images
passions
memories
and
introspective
wisdom
that
lucretius
could
not
have
dreamed
of
the
intellect
of
lucretius
rises
but
rises
comparatively
empty
his
vision
sees
things
as
a
whole
and
in
their
right
places
but
sees
very
little
of
them
he
is
quite
deaf
to
their
intricacy
to
their
birdlike
multiform
little
souls
these
goethe
knows
admirably
with
these
he
makes
a
natural
concert
all
the
more
natural
for
being
sometimes
discordant
sometimes
overloaded
and
dull
it
is
necessary
to
revert
from
lucretius
to
goethe
to
get
at
the
volume
of
life
so
too
if
we
rise
from
lucretius
to
dante
there
is
much
left
behind
which
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
dante
may
seem
at
first
sight
to
have
a
view
of
nature
not
less
complete
and
clear
than
that
of
lucretius
a
view
even
more
efficacious
than
materialism
for
fixing
the
limits
of
human
destiny
and
marking
the
path
to
happiness
but
there
is
an
illusion
here
dante
idea
of
nature
is
not
genuine
it
is
not
sincerely
put
together
out
of
reasoned
observation
it
is
a
view
of
nature
intercepted
by
myths
and
worked
out
by
dialectic
consequently
he
has
no
true
idea
either
of
the
path
to
happiness
or
of
its
real
conditions
his
notion
of
nature
is
an
inverted
image
of
the
moral
world
cast
like
a
gigantic
shadow
upon
the
sky
it
is
a
mirage
now
while
to
know
evil
and
especially
good
in
all
their
forms
and
inward
implications
is
a
far
greater
thing
than
to
know
the
natural
conditions
of
good
and
evil
or
their
real
distribution
in
space
and
time
yet
the
higher
philosophy
is
not
safe
if
the
lower
philosophy
is
wanting
or
is
false
of
course
it
is
not
safe
practically
but
it
is
not
safe
even
poetically
there
is
an
attenuated
texture
and
imagery
in
the
the
voice
that
sings
it
from
beginning
to
end
is
a
thin
all
wonder
and
naïveté
this
art
does
not
smack
of
life
but
of
somnambulism
the
reason
is
that
the
intellect
has
been
hypnotized
by
a
legendary
and
verbal
philosophy
it
has
been
unmanned
curiously
enough
by
an
excess
of
humanism
by
the
fond
delusion
that
man
and
his
moral
nature
are
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
dante
is
always
thinking
of
the
divine
order
of
history
and
of
the
spheres
he
believes
in
controlling
and
chastening
the
individual
soul
so
that
he
seems
to
be
a
cosmic
poet
and
to
have
escaped
the
anthropocentric
conceit
of
romanticism
but
he
has
not
escaped
it
for
as
we
have
seen
this
golden
cage
in
which
his
soul
sings
is
artificial
it
is
constructed
on
purpose
to
satisfy
and
glorify
human
distinctions
and
human
preferences
the
bird
is
not
in
his
native
wilds
man
is
not
in
the
bosom
of
nature
he
is
in
a
moral
sense
still
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
his
ideal
is
the
cause
of
everything
he
is
the
appointed
lord
of
the
earth
the
darling
of
heaven
and
history
is
a
brief
and
prearranged
drama
with
judea
and
rome
for
its
chief
theatre
some
of
these
illusions
are
already
abandoned
all
are
undermined
sometimes
in
moments
when
we
are
unnerved
and
uninspired
we
may
regret
the
ease
with
which
dante
could
reconcile
himself
to
a
world
so
imagined
as
to
suit
human
fancy
and
flatter
human
will
we
may
envy
dante
his
ignorance
of
nature
which
enabled
him
to
suppose
that
he
dominated
it
as
an
infinite
and
exuberant
nature
can
not
be
dominated
by
any
of
its
parts
in
the
end
however
knowledge
is
good
for
the
imagination
dante
himself
thought
so
and
his
work
proved
that
he
was
right
by
infinitely
excelling
that
of
all
ignorant
contemporary
poets
the
illusion
of
knowledge
is
better
than
ignorance
for
a
poet
but
the
reality
of
knowledge
would
be
better
than
the
illusion
it
would
stretch
the
mind
over
a
vaster
and
more
stimulating
scene
it
would
concentrate
the
will
upon
a
more
attainable
distinct
and
congenial
happiness
the
growth
of
what
is
known
increases
the
scope
of
what
may
be
imagined
and
hoped
for
throw
open
to
the
young
poet
the
infinity
of
nature
let
him
feel
the
precariousness
of
life
the
variety
of
purposes
civilizations
and
religions
even
upon
this
little
planet
let
him
trace
the
triumphs
and
follies
of
art
and
philosophy
and
their
perpetual
resurrections
like
that
of
the
downcast
faust
if
under
the
stimulus
of
such
a
scene
he
does
not
some
day
compose
a
natural
comedy
as
much
surpassing
dante
divine
comedy
in
sublimity
and
richness
as
it
will
surpass
it
in
truth
the
fault
will
not
lie
with
the
subject
which
is
inviting
and
magnificent
but
with
the
halting
genius
that
can
not
render
that
subject
worthily
undoubtedly
the
universe
so
displayed
would
not
be
without
its
dark
shadows
and
its
perpetual
tragedies
that
is
in
the
nature
of
things
dante
cosmos
for
all
its
mythical
idealism
was
not
so
false
as
not
to
have
a
hell
in
it
those
rolling
spheres
with
all
their
lights
and
music
circled
for
ever
about
hell
perhaps
in
the
real
life
of
nature
evil
may
not
prove
to
be
so
central
as
that
it
would
seem
to
be
rather
a
sort
of
inevitable
but
incidental
friction
capable
of
being
diminished
indefinitely
as
the
world
is
better
known
and
the
will
is
better
educated
in
dante
spheres
there
could
be
no
discord
whatever
but
at
the
core
of
them
was
eternal
woe
in
the
of
our
physics
discords
are
everywhere
and
harmony
is
only
tentative
and
approximate
as
it
is
in
the
best
earthly
life
but
at
the
core
there
is
nothing
sinister
only
freedom
innocence
inexhaustible
possibilities
of
all
sorts
of
happiness
these
possibilities
may
tempt
future
poets
to
describe
them
but
meantime
if
we
wish
to
have
a
vision
of
nature
not
fundamentally
false
we
must
revert
from
dante
to
lucretius
obviously
what
would
be
desirable
what
would
constitute
a
truly
philosophical
or
comprehensive
poet
would
be
the
union
of
the
insights
and
gifts
which
our
three
poets
have
possessed
this
union
is
not
impossible
the
insights
may
be
superposed
one
on
the
other
experience
in
all
its
extent
what
goethe
represents
should
be
at
the
foundation
but
as
the
extent
of
experience
is
potentially
infinite
as
there
are
all
sorts
of
worlds
possible
and
all
sorts
of
senses
and
habits
of
thought
the
widest
survey
would
still
leave
the
poet
where
goethe
leaves
us
with
a
sense
of
an
infinity
beyond
he
would
be
at
liberty
to
summon
from
the
limbo
of
potentiality
any
form
that
interested
him
poetry
and
art
would
recover
their
early
freedom
there
would
be
no
beauties
forbidden
and
none
prescribed
for
it
is
a
very
liberating
and
sublime
thing
to
summon
up
like
faust
the
image
of
experience
unless
that
has
been
done
we
leave
the
enemy
in
our
rear
whatever
interpretations
we
offer
for
experience
will
become
impertinent
and
worthless
if
the
experience
we
work
upon
is
no
longer
at
hand
nor
will
any
construction
however
broadly
based
have
an
authority
the
indomitable
freedom
of
life
to
be
more
to
be
new
to
be
what
it
has
not
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
as
yet
to
conceive
must
always
remain
standing
with
that
freedom
goes
the
modesty
of
reason
both
in
physics
and
in
morals
that
can
lay
claim
only
to
partial
knowledge
and
to
the
ordering
of
a
particular
soul
or
city
or
civilization
poetry
and
philosophy
however
are
civilized
arts
they
are
proper
to
some
particular
genius
which
has
succeeded
in
flowering
at
a
particular
time
and
place
a
poet
who
merely
swam
out
into
the
sea
of
sensibility
and
tried
to
picture
all
possible
things
real
or
unreal
human
or
inhuman
would
bring
materials
only
to
the
workshop
of
art
he
would
not
be
an
artist
to
the
genius
of
goethe
he
must
add
that
of
lucretius
and
dante
there
are
two
directions
in
which
it
seems
fitting
that
rational
art
should
proceed
on
the
basis
which
a
limited
experience
can
give
it
art
may
come
to
buttress
a
particular
form
of
life
or
it
may
come
to
express
it
all
that
we
call
industry
science
business
morality
buttresses
our
life
it
informs
us
about
our
conditions
and
adjusts
us
to
them
it
equips
us
for
life
it
lays
out
the
ground
for
the
game
we
are
to
play
this
preliminary
labour
however
need
not
be
servile
to
do
it
is
also
to
exercise
our
faculties
and
in
that
exercise
our
faculties
may
grow
free
as
the
imagination
of
lucretius
in
tracing
the
course
of
the
atoms
dances
and
soars
most
congenially
one
extension
of
art
then
would
be
in
the
direction
of
doing
artistically
joyfully
sympathetically
whatever
we
have
to
do
literature
in
particular
which
is
involved
in
history
politics
science
affairs
might
be
throughout
a
work
of
art
it
would
become
so
not
by
being
ornate
but
by
being
appropriate
and
the
sense
of
a
great
precision
and
justness
would
come
over
us
as
we
read
or
wrote
it
would
delight
us
it
would
make
us
see
how
beautiful
how
satisfying
is
the
art
of
being
observant
economical
and
sincere
the
philosophical
or
comprehensive
poet
like
homer
like
shakespeare
would
be
a
poet
of
business
he
would
have
a
taste
for
the
world
in
which
he
lived
and
a
clean
view
of
it
there
remains
a
second
form
of
rational
art
that
of
expressing
the
ideal
towards
which
we
would
move
under
these
improved
conditions
for
as
we
react
we
manifest
an
inward
principle
expressed
in
that
reaction
we
have
a
nature
that
selects
its
own
direction
and
the
direction
in
which
practical
arts
shall
transform
the
world
the
outer
life
is
for
the
sake
of
the
inner
discipline
is
for
the
sake
of
freedom
and
conquest
for
the
sake
of
this
inner
life
is
wonderfully
redundant
there
is
namely
very
much
more
in
it
than
a
consciousness
of
those
acts
by
which
the
body
adjusts
itself
to
its
surroundings

each
sense
has
its
arbitrary
quality
each
language
its
arbitrary
euphony
and
prosody
every
game
has
its
creative
laws
every
soul
its
own
tender
reverberations
and
secret
dreams
life
has
a
margin
of
play
which
might
grow
broader
if
the
sustaining
nucleus
were
more
firmly
established
in
the
world
to
the
art
of
working
well
a
civilized
race
would
add
the
art
of
playing
well
to
play
with
nature
and
make
it
decorative
to
play
with
the
overtones
of
life
and
make
them
delightful
is
a
sort
of
art
it
is
the
ultimate
the
most
artistic
sort
of
art
but
it
will
never
be
practised
successfully
so
long
as
the
other
sort
of
art
is
in
a
backward
state
for
if
we
do
not
know
our
environment
we
shall
mistake
our
dreams
for
a
part
of
it
and
so
spoil
our
science
by
making
it
fantastic
and
our
dreams
by
making
them
obligatory
the
art
and
the
religion
of
the
past
as
we
see
conspicuously
in
dante
have
fallen
into
this
error
to
correct
it
would
be
to
establish
a
new
religion
and
a
new
art
based
on
moral
liberty
and
on
moral
courage
who
shall
be
the
poet
of
this
double
insight
he
has
never
existed
but
he
is
needed
nevertheless
it
is
time
some
genius
should
appear
to
reconstitute
the
shattered
picture
of
the
world
he
should
live
in
the
continual
presence
of
all
experience
and
respect
it
he
should
at
the
same
time
understand
nature
the
ground
of
that
experience
and
he
should
also
have
a
delicate
sense
for
the
ideal
echoes
of
his
own
passions
and
for
all
the
colours
of
his
possible
happiness
all
that
can
inspire
a
poet
is
contained
in
this
task
and
nothing
less
than
this
task
would
exhaust
a
poet
inspiration
we
may
hail
this
needed
genius
from
afar
like
the
poets
in
dante
limbo
when
virgil
returns
among
them
we
may
salute
him
saying
honour
the
most
high
poet
honour
the
highest
possible
poet
but
this
supreme
poet
is
in
limbo
still
