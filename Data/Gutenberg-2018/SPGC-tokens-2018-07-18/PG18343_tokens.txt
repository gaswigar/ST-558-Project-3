hamelin
town
in
brunswick
by
famous
hanover
city
the
river
weser
deep
and
wide
washes
its
wall
on
the
southern
side
a
pleasanter
spot
you
never
spied
but
when
begins
my
ditty
almost
five
hundred
years
ago
to
see
the
townsfolk
suffer
so
from
vermin
was
a
pity
ii
rats
they
fought
the
dogs
and
killed
the
cats
and
bit
the
babies
in
the
cradles
and
ate
the
cheeses
out
of
the
vats
and
licked
the
soup
from
the
cook
own
ladles
split
open
the
kegs
of
salted
sprats
made
nests
inside
men
sunday
hats
and
even
spoiled
the
women
chats
by
drowning
their
speaking
with
shrieking
and
squeaking
in
fifty
different
sharps
and
flats
iii
at
last
the
people
in
a
body
to
the
town
hall
came
flocking
tis
clear
cried
they
our
mayor
a
noddy
and
as
for
our
corporation
shocking
to
think
we
buy
gowns
lined
with
ermine
for
dolts
that
ca
or
wo
determine
what
best
to
rid
us
of
our
vermin
you
hope
because
you
old
and
obese
to
find
in
the
furry
civic
robe
ease
rouse
up
sirs
give
your
brains
a
racking
to
find
the
remedy
we
lacking
or
sure
as
fate
we
send
you
packing
at
this
the
mayor
and
corporation
quaked
with
a
mighty
consternation
iv
an
hour
they
sate
in
council
at
length
the
mayor
broke
silence
for
a
guilder
i
my
ermine
gown
sell
i
wish
i
were
a
mile
hence
it
easy
to
bid
one
rack
one
brain
i
sure
my
poor
head
aches
again
i
scratched
it
so
and
all
in
vain
oh
for
a
trap
a
trap
a
trap
just
as
he
said
this
what
should
hap
at
the
chamber
door
but
a
gentle
tap
bless
us
cried
the
mayor
what
that
with
the
corporation
as
he
sat
looking
little
though
wondrous
fat
nor
brighter
was
his
eye
nor
moister
than
a
oyster
save
when
at
noon
his
paunch
grew
mutinous
for
a
plate
of
turtle
green
and
glutinous
only
a
scraping
of
shoes
on
the
mat
anything
like
the
sound
of
a
rat
makes
my
heart
go
come
in
the
mayor
cried
looking
bigger
and
in
did
come
the
strangest
figure
his
queer
long
coat
from
heel
to
head
was
half
of
yellow
and
half
of
red
and
he
himself
was
tall
and
thin
with
sharp
blue
eyes
each
like
a
pin
and
light
loose
hair
yet
swarthy
skin
no
tuft
on
cheek
nor
beard
on
chin
but
lips
where
smile
went
out
and
in
there
was
no
guessing
his
kith
and
kin
and
nobody
could
enough
admire
the
tall
man
and
his
quaint
attire
quoth
one
it
as
my
starting
up
at
the
trump
of
doom
tone
had
walked
this
way
from
his
painted
tombstone
vi
he
advanced
to
the
and
please
your
honours
said
he
i
able
by
means
of
a
secret
charm
to
draw
all
creatures
living
beneath
the
sun
that
creep
or
swim
or
fly
or
run
after
me
so
as
you
never
saw
and
i
chiefly
use
my
charm
on
creatures
that
do
people
harm
the
mole
and
toad
and
newt
and
viper
and
people
call
me
the
pied
piper
and
here
they
noticed
round
his
neck
a
scarf
of
red
and
yellow
stripe
to
match
with
his
coat
of
the
cheque
and
at
the
scarf
end
hung
a
pipe
and
his
fingers
they
noticed
were
ever
straying
as
if
impatient
to
be
playing
upon
his
pipe
as
low
it
dangled
over
his
vesture
so
yet
said
he
poor
piper
as
i
am
in
tartary
i
freed
the
cham
last
june
from
his
huge
swarms
of
gnats
i
eased
in
asia
the
nizam
of
a
monstrous
brood
of
and
as
for
what
your
brain
bewilders
if
i
can
rid
your
town
of
rats
will
you
give
me
a
thousand
guilders
one
fifty
thousand
was
the
exclamation
of
the
astonished
mayor
and
corporation
vii
into
the
street
the
piper
stept
smiling
first
a
little
smile
as
if
he
knew
what
magic
slept
in
his
quiet
pipe
the
while
then
like
a
musical
adept
to
blow
the
pipe
his
lips
he
wrinkled
and
green
and
blue
his
sharp
eyes
twinkled
like
a
where
salt
is
sprinkled
and
ere
three
shrill
notes
the
pipe
uttered
you
heard
as
if
an
army
muttered
and
the
muttering
grew
to
a
grumbling
and
the
grumbling
grew
to
a
mighty
rumbling
and
out
of
the
houses
the
rats
came
tumbling
great
rats
small
rats
lean
rats
brawny
rats
brown
rats
black
rats
grey
rats
tawny
rats
grave
old
plodders
gay
young
friskers
fathers
mothers
uncles
cousins
cocking
tails
and
pricking
whiskers
families
by
tens
and
dozens
brothers
sisters
husbands
wives
followed
the
piper
for
their
lives
from
street
to
street
he
piped
advancing
and
step
for
step
they
followed
dancing
until
they
came
to
the
river
weser
wherein
all
plunged
and
perished
save
one
who
stout
as
julius
c√¶sar
swam
across
and
lived
to
carry
as
he
the
manuscript
he
cherished
to
home
his
commentary
which
was
at
the
first
shrill
notes
of
the
pipe
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
scraping
tripe
and
putting
apples
wondrous
ripe
into
a
gripe
and
a
moving
away
of
and
a
leaving
ajar
of
and
a
drawing
the
corks
of
and
a
breaking
the
hoops
of
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
voice
sweeter
far
than
by
harp
or
by
psaltery
is
breathed
called
out
rats
rejoice
the
world
is
grown
to
one
vast
drysaltery
so
munch
on
crunch
on
take
your
nuncheon
breakfast
supper
dinner
luncheon
and
just
as
a
bulky
all
ready
staved
like
a
great
sun
shone
glorious
scarce
an
inch
before
me
just
as
methought
it
said
bore
me
i
found
the
weser
rolling
me
viii
you
should
have
heard
the
hamelin
people
ringing
the
bells
till
they
rocked
the
steeple
go
cried
the
mayor
and
get
long
poles
poke
out
the
nests
and
block
up
the
holes
consult
with
carpenters
and
builders
and
leave
in
our
town
not
even
a
trace
of
the
rats
when
suddenly
up
the
face
of
the
piper
perked
in
the
with
a
first
if
you
please
my
thousand
guilders
ix
a
thousand
guilders
the
mayor
looked
blue
so
did
the
corporation
too
for
council
dinners
made
rare
havoc
with
claret
moselle
hock
and
half
the
money
would
replenish
their
cellar
biggest
butt
with
rhenish
to
pay
this
sum
to
a
wandering
fellow
with
a
gipsy
coat
of
red
and
yellow
beside
quoth
the
mayor
with
a
knowing
wink
our
business
was
done
at
the
river
brink
we
saw
with
our
eyes
the
vermin
sink
and
what
dead
ca
come
to
life
i
think
so
friend
we
not
the
folks
to
shrink
from
the
duty
of
giving
you
something
to
drink
and
a
matter
of
money
to
put
in
your
poke
but
as
for
the
guilders
what
we
spoke
of
them
as
you
very
well
know
was
in
joke
beside
our
losses
have
made
us
thrifty
a
thousand
guilders
come
take
fifty
x
the
piper
face
fell
and
he
cried
no
trifling
i
ca
wait
beside
i
promised
to
visit
by
bagdad
and
accept
the
prime
of
the
pottage
all
he
rich
in
for
having
left
in
the
caliph
kitchen
of
a
nest
of
scorpions
no
survivor
with
him
i
proved
no
with
you
do
think
i
bate
a
stiver
and
folks
who
put
me
in
a
passion
may
find
me
pipe
after
another
fashion
xi
how
cried
the
mayor
d
ye
think
i
brook
being
worse
treated
than
a
cook
insulted
by
a
lazy
ribald
with
idle
pipe
and
vesture
piebald
you
threaten
us
fellow
do
your
worst
blow
your
pipe
there
till
you
burst
xii
once
more
he
stept
into
the
street
and
to
his
lips
again
laid
his
long
pipe
of
smooth
straight
cane
and
ere
he
blew
three
notes
such
sweet
soft
notes
as
yet
musician
cunning
never
gave
the
enraptured
air
there
was
a
rustling
that
seemed
like
a
bustling
of
merry
crowds
justling
at
pitching
and
hustling
small
feet
were
pattering
wooden
shoes
clattering
little
hands
clapping
and
little
tongues
chattering
and
like
fowls
in
a
when
barley
is
scattering
out
came
the
children
running
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
with
rosy
cheeks
and
flaxen
curls
and
sparkling
eyes
and
teeth
like
pearls
tripping
and
skipping
ran
merrily
after
the
wonderful
music
with
shouting
and
laughter
xiii
the
mayor
was
dumb
and
the
council
stood
as
if
they
were
changed
into
blocks
of
wood
unable
to
move
a
step
or
cry
to
the
children
merrily
skipping
by
could
only
follow
with
the
eye
that
joyous
crowd
at
the
piper
back
but
how
the
mayor
was
on
the
rack
and
the
wretched
council
bosoms
beat
as
the
piper
turned
from
the
high
street
to
where
the
weser
rolled
its
waters
right
in
the
way
of
their
sons
and
daughters
however
he
turned
from
south
to
west
and
to
koppelberg
hill
his
steps
addressed
and
after
him
the
children
pressed
great
was
the
joy
in
every
breast
he
never
can
cross
that
mighty
top
he
forced
to
let
the
piping
drop
and
we
shall
see
our
children
stop
when
lo
as
they
reached
the
a
wondrous
portal
opened
wide
as
if
a
cavern
was
suddenly
hollowed
and
the
piper
advanced
and
the
children
followed
and
when
all
were
in
to
the
very
last
the
door
in
the
mountain
side
shut
fast
did
i
say
all
no
one
was
lame
and
could
not
dance
the
whole
of
the
way
and
in
after
years
if
you
would
blame
his
sadness
he
was
used
to
say
it
dull
in
our
town
since
my
playmates
left
i
ca
forget
that
i
bereft
of
all
the
pleasant
sights
they
see
which
the
piper
also
promised
me
for
he
led
us
he
said
to
a
joyous
land
joining
the
town
and
just
at
hand
where
waters
gushed
and
grew
and
flowers
put
forth
a
fairer
hue
and
everything
was
strange
and
new
the
sparrows
were
brighter
than
peacocks
here
and
their
dogs
outran
our
fallow
deer
and
had
lost
their
stings
and
horses
were
born
with
eagles
wings
and
just
as
i
became
assured
my
lame
foot
would
be
speedily
cured
the
music
stopped
and
i
stood
still
and
found
myself
outside
the
hill
left
alone
against
my
will
to
go
now
limping
as
before
and
never
hear
of
that
country
more
xiv
alas
alas
for
hamelin
there
came
into
many
a
burgher
pate
a
text
which
says
that
heaven
gate
opes
to
the
rich
at
as
easy
rate
as
the
needle
eye
takes
a
camel
in
the
mayor
sent
east
west
north
and
south
to
offer
the
piper
by
word
of
mouth
wherever
it
was
men
lot
to
find
him
silver
and
gold
to
his
heart
content
if
he
only
return
the
way
he
went
and
bring
the
children
behind
him
but
when
they
saw
was
a
lost
endeavour
and
piper
and
dancers
were
gone
for
ever
they
made
a
decree
that
lawyers
never
should
think
their
records
dated
duly
if
after
the
day
of
the
month
and
year
these
words
did
not
as
well
appear
and
so
long
after
what
happened
here
on
the
of
july
thirteen
hundred
and
and
the
better
in
memory
to
fix
the
place
of
the
children
last
retreat
they
called
it
the
pied
piper
street
where
any
one
playing
on
pipe
or
tabor
was
sure
for
the
future
to
lose
his
labour
nor
suffered
they
hostelry
or
tavern
to
shock
with
mirth
a
street
so
solemn
but
opposite
the
place
of
the
cavern
they
wrote
the
story
on
a
column
and
on
the
great
painted
the
same
to
make
the
world
acquainted
how
their
children
were
stolen
away
and
there
it
stands
to
this
very
day
and
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
in
transylvania
there
a
tribe
of
alien
people
that
ascribe
the
outlandish
ways
and
dress
on
which
their
neighbours
lay
such
stress
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
having
risen
out
of
some
subterraneous
prison
into
which
they
were
trepanned
long
time
ago
in
a
mighty
band
out
of
hamelin
town
in
brunswick
land
but
how
or
why
they
do
understand
xv
so
willy
let
me
and
you
be
wipers
of
scores
out
with
all
men
especially
pipers
and
whether
they
pipe
us
free
from
rats
or
from
mice
if
we
promised
them
aught
let
us
keep
our
promise
