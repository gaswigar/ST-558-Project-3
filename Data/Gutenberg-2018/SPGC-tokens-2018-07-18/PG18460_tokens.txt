and
hated
in
two
worlds
hradzka
dreamed
of
a
glory
stranded
in
the
past
with
his
knowledge
of
the
future
but
he
did
know
the
past
quite
well
enough
but
yesterday
a
whole
planet
had
shouted
hradzka
hail
the
leader
today
they
were
screaming
to
hradzka
kill
the
tyrant
the
palace
where
hradzka
surrounded
by
his
sycophants
and
guards
had
lorded
it
over
a
solar
system
was
now
an
inferno
those
who
had
been
too
closely
identified
with
the
dictator
rule
to
hope
for
forgiveness
were
fighting
to
the
last
seeking
only
a
quick
death
in
combat
one
by
one
their
isolated
points
of
resistance
were
being
wiped
out
the
corridors
and
chambers
of
the
huge
palace
were
thronged
with
rebels
loud
with
their
shouts
and
with
the
rasping
hiss
of
and
the
crash
of
blasters
reeking
with
the
stench
of
scorched
plastic
and
burned
flesh
of
hot
metal
and
charred
fabric
the
living
quarters
were
overrun
the
mob
smashed
down
walls
and
tore
up
floors
in
search
of
secret
they
found
strange
things
the
that
had
been
built
under
one
of
the
domes
in
readiness
for
flight
to
the
colonies
on
mars
or
the
asteroid
belt
for
instance
but
hradzka
himself
they
could
not
find
at
last
the
search
reached
the
new
tower
which
reared
its
head
five
thousand
feet
above
the
palace
the
highest
thing
in
the
city
they
blasted
down
the
huge
steel
doors
cut
the
power
from
the
they
landed
from
on
the
upper
levels
but
except
for
barriers
of
metal
and
concrete
and
energy
they
met
with
no
opposition
finally
they
came
to
the
spiral
stairway
which
led
up
to
the
great
metal
sphere
which
capped
the
whole
structure
general
zarvas
the
army
commander
who
had
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
revolt
stood
with
his
foot
on
the
lowest
step
his
followers
behind
him
there
was
prince
burvanny
the
leader
of
the
old
nobility
and
ghorzesko
orhm
the
merchant
and
between
them
stood
tobbh
the
chieftain
of
the
mutinous
slaves
there
were
clerks
laborers
poor
but
haughty
nobles
and
wealthy
merchants
who
had
long
been
forced
to
hide
their
riches
from
the
dictator
and
soldiers
and
spacemen
you
better
let
some
of
us
go
first
sir
general
zarvas
orderly
a
bandage
about
his
head
his
uniform
in
rags
suggested
you
do
know
what
might
be
up
there
the
general
shook
his
head
i
go
first
zarvas
pol
was
not
the
man
to
send
subordinates
into
danger
ahead
of
himself
to
tell
the
truth
i
afraid
we
wo
find
anything
at
all
up
there
you
mean
ghorzesko
orhm
began
the
zarvas
pol
replied
if
he
managed
to
get
it
finished
the
great
mind
only
knows
where
he
may
be
now
or
when
he
loosened
the
blaster
in
his
holster
and
started
up
the
long
spiral
his
followers
spread
out
below
took
position
to
cover
his
ascent
prince
burvanny
and
tobbh
the
slave
started
to
follow
him
they
hesitated
as
each
motioned
the
other
to
precede
him
then
the
nobleman
followed
the
general
his
blaster
drawn
and
the
brawny
slave
behind
him
the
door
at
the
top
was
open
and
zarvas
pol
stepped
through
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
great
spherical
room
except
a
raised
dais
some
fifty
feet
in
diameter
its
polished
metal
top
strangely
clean
and
empty
and
a
crumpled
heap
of
burned
cloth
and
charred
flesh
that
had
not
long
ago
been
a
man
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
the
star
of
the
learned
brothers
on
his
breast
advanced
to
meet
the
armed
intruders
so
he
is
gone
kradzy
zago
zarvas
pol
said
holstering
his
weapon
gone
in
the
to
hide
in
yesterday
or
tomorrow
and
you
let
him
go
the
old
one
nodded
he
had
a
blaster
and
i
had
none
he
indicated
the
body
on
the
floor
zoldy
jarv
had
no
blaster
either
but
he
tried
to
stop
hradzka
see
he
squandered
his
life
as
a
fool
squanders
his
money
getting
nothing
for
it
and
a
man
life
is
not
money
zarvas
pol
i
do
not
blame
you
kradzy
zago
general
zarvas
said
but
now
you
must
get
to
work
and
build
us
another
so
that
we
can
hunt
him
down
does
revenge
mean
so
much
to
you
then
the
soldier
made
an
impatient
gesture
revenge
is
for
fools
like
that
pack
of
screaming
beasts
below
i
do
not
kill
for
revenge
i
kill
because
dead
men
do
no
harm
hradzka
will
do
us
no
more
harm
the
old
scientist
replied
he
is
a
thing
of
yesterday
of
a
time
long
past
and
in
the
mists
of
legend
no
matter
as
long
as
he
exists
at
any
point
in
hradzka
is
still
a
threat
revenge
means
much
to
hradzka
he
will
return
for
it
when
we
least
expect
him
the
old
man
shook
his
head
no
zarvas
pol
hradzka
will
not
return
hradzka
holstered
his
blaster
threw
the
switch
that
sealed
the
put
on
the
and
started
the
unit
he
reached
out
and
set
the
for
the
century
of
the
atomic
era
that
would
land
him
in
the
ninth
age
of
chaos
following
the
war
and
the
collapse
of
the
world
theocracy
a
good
time
for
his
purpose
the
world
would
be
slipping
back
into
barbarism
and
yet
possess
the
technologies
of
former
civilizations
a
hundred
little
national
states
would
be
trying
to
regain
social
stability
competing
and
warring
with
one
another
hradzka
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
cases
of
books
pictures
and
these
people
of
the
past
would
welcome
him
and
his
science
of
the
future
would
make
him
their
leader
he
would
start
in
a
small
way
by
taking
over
the
local
feudal
or
tribal
government
would
arm
his
followers
with
weapons
of
the
future
then
he
would
impose
his
rule
upon
neighboring
tribes
or
princedoms
or
communes
or
whatever
and
build
a
strong
sovereignty
from
that
he
envisioned
a
world
empire
a
solar
system
empire
then
he
would
build
many
he
would
recruit
an
army
such
as
the
universe
had
never
seen
a
swarm
of
men
from
every
age
in
the
past
at
that
point
he
would
return
to
the
hundredth
century
of
the
atomic
era
to
wreak
vengeance
upon
those
who
had
risen
against
him
a
slow
smile
grew
on
hradzka
thin
lips
as
he
thought
of
the
tortures
with
which
he
would
put
zarvas
pol
to
death
he
glanced
up
at
the
great
disc
of
the
indicator
and
frowned
already
he
was
back
to
the
year
and
the
had
not
begun
to
slow
the
disc
was
turning
even
more
rapidly
he
gasped
slightly
then
he
had
passed
his
destination
he
was
now
in
the
fortieth
century
but
the
indicator
was
slowing
the
hairline
crossed
the
thirtieth
century
the
twentieth
the
fifteenth
the
tenth
he
wondered
what
had
gone
wrong
but
he
had
recovered
from
his
fright
by
this
time
when
this
insane
machine
stopped
as
it
must
around
the
first
century
of
the
atomic
era
he
would
investigate
make
repairs
then
shift
forward
to
his
hradzka
was
determined
upon
the
century
he
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
history
of
that
period
had
learned
the
language
spoken
then
and
he
understood
the
methods
necessary
to
gain
power
over
the
natives
of
that
time
the
came
to
a
stop
in
the
first
century
he
switched
on
the
magnifier
and
leaned
forward
to
look
he
had
emerged
into
normal
time
in
the
year
of
the
atomic
era
a
decade
after
the
first
had
gone
into
operation
and
seven
years
after
the
first
atomic
bombs
had
been
exploded
in
warfare
the
altimeter
showed
that
he
was
hovering
at
eight
thousand
feet
above
slowly
he
cut
out
the
antigrav
letting
the
time
machine
down
easily
he
knew
that
there
had
been
no
danger
of
materializing
inside
anything
the
new
tower
had
been
built
to
put
it
above
anything
that
had
occupied
that
at
any
moment
within
history
or
legend
or
even
the
geological
knowledge
of
man
what
lay
below
however
was
uncertain
it
was
night
the
showed
only
a
and
dark
shadows
below
he
snapped
another
switch
for
a
few
a
beam
of
intense
light
was
turned
on
automatically
photographing
the
landscape
under
him
a
second
later
the
developed
picture
was
projected
upon
another
screen
it
showed
only
wooded
mountains
and
a
barren
valley
the
came
to
rest
with
a
soft
jar
and
a
crashing
of
broken
bushes
that
was
audible
through
the
sound
pickup
hradzka
pulled
the
main
switch
there
was
a
click
as
the
shielding
went
out
and
the
door
opened
a
breath
of
cool
night
air
drew
into
the
hollow
sphere
then
there
was
a
loud
inside
the
mechanism
and
a
flash
of
light
which
turned
to
pinkish
flame
with
a
nasty
crackling
curls
of
smoke
began
to
rise
from
the
square
black
box
that
housed
the
mechanism
and
from
behind
the
in
a
moment
everything
was
driblets
of
aluminum
and
silver
were
running
down
from
the
instruments
then
the
whole
interior
of
the
was
afire
there
was
barely
time
for
hradzka
to
leap
through
the
open
door
the
brush
outside
impeded
him
and
he
used
his
blaster
to
clear
a
path
for
himself
away
from
the
big
sphere
which
was
now
glowing
faintly
on
the
outside
the
heat
grew
in
intensity
and
the
brush
outside
was
taking
fire
it
was
not
until
he
had
gotten
two
hundred
yards
from
the
machine
that
he
stopped
realizing
what
had
happened
the
machine
of
course
had
been
sabotaged
that
would
have
been
young
zoldy
whom
he
had
killed
or
that
old
kradzy
zago
the
latter
most
likely
he
cursed
both
of
them
for
having
marooned
him
in
this
savage
age
at
the
very
beginning
of
atomic
civilization
with
all
his
printed
and
recorded
knowledge
destroyed
oh
he
could
still
gain
mastery
over
these
barbarians
he
knew
enough
to
fashion
a
crude
blaster
or
a
gun
or
an
conversion
unit
but
without
his
books
and
records
he
could
never
build
an
antigrav
unit
and
the
secret
of
the
temporal
shift
was
lost
for
time
is
not
an
object
or
a
medium
which
can
be
travelled
along
the
was
not
a
vehicle
it
was
a
mechanical
process
of
displacement
within
the
continuum
and
those
who
constructed
it
knew
that
it
could
not
be
used
with
the
sort
of
accuracy
that
the
dials
indicated
hradzka
had
ordered
his
scientists
to
produce
a
time
machine
and
they
had
combined
the
possible
displacement
within
the
continuum
with
the
sort
of
fiction
the
dictator
demanded
for
their
own
even
had
there
been
no
sabotage
his
return
to
his
own
time
was
nearly
of
zero
probability
the
fire
spreading
from
the
was
blowing
toward
him
he
observed
the
and
hurried
around
out
of
the
path
of
the
flames
the
light
enabled
him
to
pick
his
way
through
the
brush
and
after
crossing
a
small
stream
he
found
a
rutted
road
and
followed
it
up
the
mountainside
until
he
came
to
a
place
where
he
could
rest
concealed
until
morning
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
woke
and
there
was
a
strange
throbbing
sound
hradzka
lay
motionless
under
the
brush
where
he
had
slept
his
blaster
ready
in
a
few
minutes
a
vehicle
came
into
sight
following
the
road
down
the
mountainside
it
was
a
large
thing
with
a
projection
in
front
which
probably
housed
the
engine
and
a
cab
for
the
operator
the
body
of
the
vehicle
was
simply
an
open
rectangular
box
there
were
two
men
in
the
cab
and
about
twenty
or
thirty
more
crowded
into
the
box
body
these
were
dressed
in
faded
and
nondescript
garments
of
blue
and
gray
and
brown
all
were
armed
with
crude
weapons
axes
instruments
with
serrated
edges
and
what
looked
like
spears
the
vehicle
itself
which
seemed
to
be
propelled
by
some
sort
of
engine
was
dingy
and
the
men
in
it
were
ragged
and
unshaven
hradzka
snorted
in
contempt
they
were
probably
warriors
of
the
local
tribe
going
to
the
fire
in
the
belief
that
it
had
been
started
by
raiding
enemies
when
they
found
the
wreckage
of
the
they
would
no
doubt
believe
that
it
was
the
chariot
of
some
god
and
drag
it
home
to
be
venerated
a
plan
of
action
was
taking
shape
in
his
mind
first
he
must
get
clothing
of
the
sort
worn
by
these
people
and
find
a
safe
for
his
own
things
then
pretending
to
be
a
he
would
go
among
them
to
learn
something
of
their
customs
and
pick
up
the
language
when
he
had
done
that
he
would
move
on
to
another
tribe
or
village
able
to
tell
a
credible
story
for
himself
for
a
while
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
do
menial
work
but
in
the
end
he
would
establish
himself
among
these
people
then
he
could
gather
around
him
a
faction
of
those
who
were
dissatisfied
with
whatever
conditions
existed
organize
a
conspiracy
make
arms
for
his
followers
and
start
his
program
of
the
matter
of
clothing
was
attended
to
shortly
after
he
had
crossed
the
mountain
and
descended
into
the
valley
on
the
other
side
hearing
a
clinking
sound
some
distance
from
the
road
as
of
metal
striking
stone
hradzka
stole
cautiously
through
the
woods
until
he
came
within
sight
of
a
man
who
was
digging
with
a
mattock
uprooting
small
bushes
of
a
particular
sort
with
rough
gray
bark
and
leaves
when
he
had
dug
one
up
he
would
cut
off
the
roots
and
then
slice
away
the
with
a
knife
putting
it
into
a
sack
hradzka
lip
curled
contemptuously
the
fellow
was
gathering
the
stuff
for
medicinal
use
he
had
heard
of
the
use
of
roots
and
herbs
for
such
purposes
by
the
ancient
savages
the
blaster
would
be
no
use
here
it
was
too
powerful
and
would
destroy
the
clothing
that
the
man
was
wearing
he
unfastened
a
strap
from
his
belt
and
attached
it
to
a
stone
to
form
a
then
inched
forward
behind
the
lone
when
he
was
close
enough
he
straightened
and
rushed
forward
swinging
his
improvised
weapon
the
man
heard
him
and
turned
too
late
after
undressing
his
victim
hradzka
used
the
mattock
to
finish
him
and
then
to
dig
a
grave
the
fugitive
buried
his
own
clothes
with
the
murdered
man
and
donned
the
faded
blue
shirt
rough
shoes
worn
trousers
and
jacket
the
blaster
he
concealed
under
the
jacket
and
he
kept
a
few
other
hundredth
century
gadgets
these
he
would
hide
somewhere
closer
to
his
center
of
operations
he
had
kept
among
other
things
a
small
box
of
capsules
and
in
one
pocket
of
the
newly
acquired
jacket
he
found
a
package
containing
food
it
was
rough
and
unappetizing
fare
slices
of
cold
cooked
meat
between
slices
of
some
cereal
substance
he
ate
these
before
filling
in
the
grave
and
put
the
paper
wrappings
in
with
the
dead
man
then
his
work
finished
he
threw
the
mattock
into
the
brush
and
set
out
again
grimacing
disgustedly
and
scratching
himself
the
clothing
he
had
appropriated
was
verminous
crossing
another
mountain
he
descended
into
a
second
valley
and
for
a
time
lost
his
way
among
a
tangle
of
narrow
ravines
it
was
dark
by
the
time
he
mounted
a
hill
and
found
himself
looking
down
another
valley
in
which
a
few
scattered
lights
gave
evidence
of
human
habitations
not
wishing
to
arouse
suspicion
by
approaching
these
in
the
he
found
a
place
among
some
young
evergreens
where
he
could
sleep
the
next
morning
having
breakfasted
on
a
concentrate
capsule
he
found
a
for
his
blaster
in
a
hollow
tree
it
was
in
a
sufficiently
prominent
position
so
that
he
could
easily
find
it
again
and
at
the
same
time
unlikely
to
be
discovered
by
some
native
then
he
went
down
into
the
inhabited
valley
he
was
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he
established
contact
with
the
natives
the
first
dwelling
which
he
approached
a
cluster
of
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
gave
him
shelter
there
was
a
man
clad
in
the
same
sort
of
rough
garments
hradzka
had
taken
from
the
body
of
the
and
a
woman
in
a
faded
and
shapeless
dress
the
man
was
thin
and
the
woman
short
and
heavy
both
were
past
middle
age
he
made
inarticulate
sounds
to
attract
their
attention
then
gestured
to
his
mouth
and
ears
to
indicate
his
assumed
affliction
he
rubbed
his
stomach
to
portray
hunger
looking
about
he
saw
an
ax
sticking
in
a
and
a
pile
of
wood
near
it
probably
the
fuel
used
by
these
people
he
took
the
ax
split
up
some
of
the
wood
then
repeated
the
the
man
and
the
woman
both
nodded
laughing
he
was
shown
a
pile
of
and
the
man
picked
up
a
short
billet
of
wood
and
used
it
like
a
to
indicate
that
all
the
wood
was
to
be
cut
to
that
length
hradzka
fell
to
work
and
by
he
had
all
the
wood
cut
he
had
seen
a
circular
stone
mounted
on
a
trestle
with
a
metal
axle
through
it
and
judged
it
to
be
some
sort
of
a
since
it
was
fitted
with
a
and
a
rusty
metal
can
was
set
above
it
to
spill
water
onto
the
after
chopping
the
wood
he
carefully
sharpened
the
ax
handing
it
to
the
man
for
inspection
this
seemed
to
please
the
man
he
clapped
hradzka
on
the
shoulder
making
commendatory
sounds
it
required
considerable
time
and
ingenuity
to
make
himself
a
more
or
less
permanent
member
of
the
household
hradzka
had
made
a
survey
of
the
farmyard
noting
the
sorts
of
work
that
would
normally
be
performed
on
the
farm
and
he
pantomimed
this
work
in
its
simpler
operations
he
pointed
to
the
east
where
the
sun
would
rise
and
to
the
zenith
and
to
the
west
he
made
signs
indicative
of
eating
and
of
sleeping
and
of
rising
and
of
working
at
length
he
succeeded
in
conveying
his
meaning
there
was
considerable
argument
between
the
man
and
the
woman
but
his
proposal
was
accepted
as
he
expected
that
it
would
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
work
of
the
farm
was
hard
for
this
aging
couple
now
for
a
place
to
sleep
and
a
little
food
they
were
able
to
acquire
a
strong
and
intelligent
slave
in
the
days
that
followed
he
made
himself
useful
to
the
farm
people
he
fed
the
chickens
and
the
livestock
milked
the
cow
worked
in
the
fields
he
slept
in
a
small
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
under
the
eaves
and
ate
with
the
man
and
woman
in
the
farmhouse
kitchen
it
was
not
long
before
he
picked
up
a
few
words
which
he
had
heard
his
employers
using
and
related
them
to
the
things
or
acts
spoken
of
and
he
began
to
notice
that
these
people
in
spite
of
the
crudities
of
their
own
life
enjoyed
some
of
the
advantages
of
a
fairly
complex
civilization
their
implements
were
not
products
but
showed
machine
workmanship
there
were
two
objects
hanging
on
hooks
on
the
kitchen
wall
which
he
was
sure
were
weapons
both
had
wooden
and
wooden
they
had
long
tubes
extending
to
the
front
and
triggers
like
blasters
one
had
double
tubes
mounted
and
double
triggers
the
other
had
an
octagonal
tube
mounted
over
a
round
tube
and
a
loop
extension
on
the
then
there
was
a
box
on
the
kitchen
wall
with
a
mouthpiece
and
a
cylindrical
tube
on
a
cord
sometimes
a
bell
would
ring
out
of
the
box
and
the
woman
would
go
to
this
instrument
take
down
the
tube
and
hold
it
to
her
ear
and
talk
into
the
mouthpiece
there
was
another
box
from
which
voices
would
issue
of
people
conversing
or
of
orators
or
of
singing
and
sometimes
instrumental
music
none
of
these
were
objects
made
by
savages
these
people
probably
traded
with
some
fairly
high
civilization
they
were
not
illiterate
he
found
printed
matter
indicating
the
use
of
some
phonetic
alphabet
and
paper
pamphlets
containing
printed
reproductions
of
photographs
as
well
as
verbal
text
there
was
also
a
vehicle
on
the
farm
powered
like
the
one
he
had
seen
on
the
road
by
an
engine
in
which
a
hydrocarbon
was
exploded
he
made
it
his
business
to
examine
this
minutely
and
to
study
its
construction
and
operation
until
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
it
was
not
until
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
that
the
chickens
began
to
die
in
the
morning
hradzka
found
three
of
them
dead
when
he
went
to
feed
them
the
rest
drooping
unhealthily
he
summoned
the
man
and
showed
him
what
he
had
found
the
next
morning
they
were
all
dead
and
the
cow
was
sick
she
gave
bloody
milk
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
she
lay
in
her
stall
and
would
not
get
up
the
man
and
the
woman
were
also
beginning
to
sicken
though
both
of
them
tried
to
continue
their
work
it
was
the
woman
who
first
noticed
that
the
plants
around
the
farmhouse
were
withering
and
turning
yellow
the
farmer
went
to
the
stable
with
hradzka
and
looked
at
the
cow
shaking
his
head
he
limped
back
to
the
house
and
returned
carrying
one
of
the
weapons
from
the
kitchen
the
one
with
the
single
trigger
and
the
octagonal
tube
as
he
entered
the
stable
he
jerked
down
and
up
on
the
loop
extension
of
the
then
put
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
and
pointed
it
at
the
cow
it
made
a
flash
and
roared
louder
even
than
a
and
the
cow
jerked
convulsively
and
was
dead
the
man
then
indicated
by
signs
that
hradzka
was
to
drag
the
dead
cow
out
of
the
stable
dig
a
hole
and
bury
it
this
hradzka
did
carefully
examining
the
wound
in
the
cow
head
the
weapon
he
decided
was
not
an
but
a
simple
projector
by
evening
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
were
able
to
eat
and
both
seemed
to
be
suffering
intensely
the
man
used
the
on
the
wall
probably
calling
on
his
friends
for
help
hradzka
did
what
he
could
to
make
them
comfortable
cooked
his
own
meal
washed
the
dishes
as
he
had
seen
the
woman
doing
and
tidied
up
the
kitchen
it
was
not
long
before
people
men
and
women
whom
he
had
seen
on
the
road
or
who
had
stopped
at
the
farmhouse
while
he
had
been
there
began
arriving
some
carrying
baskets
of
food
and
shortly
after
hradzka
had
eaten
a
vehicle
like
the
farmer
but
in
better
condition
and
of
better
quality
arrived
and
a
young
man
got
out
of
it
and
entered
the
house
carrying
a
leather
bag
he
was
apparently
some
sort
of
a
scientist
he
examined
the
man
and
his
wife
asked
many
questions
and
administered
drugs
he
also
took
samples
for
and
urinalysis
this
hradzka
considered
was
another
of
the
many
contradictions
he
had
encountered
among
these
people
this
man
behaved
like
an
educated
scientist
and
seemingly
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
peasant
on
the
mountainside
the
fact
was
that
hradzka
was
worried
the
strange
death
of
the
animals
the
blight
which
had
smitten
the
trees
and
vegetables
around
the
farm
and
the
sickness
of
the
farmer
and
his
woman
all
mystified
him
he
did
not
know
of
any
disease
which
would
affect
plants
and
animals
and
humans
he
wondered
if
some
poisonous
gas
might
not
be
escaping
from
the
earth
near
the
farmhouse
however
he
had
not
himself
been
affected
he
also
disliked
the
way
in
which
the
doctor
and
the
neighbors
seemed
to
be
talking
about
him
while
he
had
come
to
a
considerable
revision
of
his
original
opinion
about
the
of
these
people
it
was
not
impossible
that
they
might
suspect
him
of
having
caused
the
whole
thing
by
witchcraft
at
any
moment
they
might
fall
upon
him
and
put
him
to
death
in
any
case
there
was
no
longer
any
use
in
his
staying
here
and
it
might
be
wise
if
he
left
at
once
accordingly
he
filled
his
pockets
with
food
from
the
pantry
and
slipped
out
of
the
farmhouse
before
his
absence
was
discovered
he
was
well
on
his
way
down
the
road
that
night
hradzka
slept
under
a
bridge
across
a
fairly
wide
stream
the
next
morning
he
followed
the
road
until
he
came
to
a
town
it
was
not
a
large
place
there
were
perhaps
four
or
five
hundred
houses
and
other
buildings
in
it
most
of
these
were
dwellings
like
the
farmhouse
where
he
had
been
staying
but
some
were
much
larger
and
seemed
to
be
places
of
business
one
of
these
latter
was
a
concrete
structure
with
wide
doors
at
the
front
inside
he
could
see
men
working
on
the
vehicles
which
seemed
to
be
in
almost
universal
use
hradzka
decided
to
obtain
employment
here
it
would
be
best
he
decided
to
continue
his
pretense
of
being
a
he
did
not
know
whether
a
were
in
use
at
this
time
or
not
and
even
if
not
the
pretense
of
being
a
foreigner
unable
to
speak
the
local
dialect
might
be
dangerous
so
he
entered
the
shop
and
accosted
a
man
in
a
clean
shirt
who
seemed
to
be
issuing
instructions
to
the
workers
going
into
his
pantomime
of
the
homeless
mute
seeking
employment
the
master
of
the
merely
laughed
at
him
however
hradzka
became
more
insistent
in
his
manner
making
signs
to
indicate
his
hunger
and
willingness
to
work
the
other
men
in
the
shop
left
their
tasks
and
gathered
around
there
was
much
laughter
and
unmistakably
ribald
and
derogatory
remarks
hradzka
was
beginning
to
give
up
hope
of
getting
employment
here
when
one
of
the
workmen
approached
the
master
and
whispered
something
to
him
the
two
of
them
walked
away
conversing
in
low
voices
hradzka
thought
he
understood
the
situation
no
doubt
the
workman
thinking
to
lighten
his
own
labor
was
urging
that
the
vagrant
be
employed
for
no
other
pay
than
food
and
lodging
at
length
the
master
assented
to
his
urgings
he
returned
showed
hradzka
a
hose
and
a
bucket
and
sponges
and
cloths
and
set
him
to
work
cleaning
the
mud
from
one
of
the
vehicles
then
after
seeing
that
the
work
was
being
done
properly
he
went
away
entering
a
room
at
one
side
of
the
shop
about
twenty
minutes
later
another
man
entered
the
shop
he
was
not
dressed
like
any
of
the
other
people
whom
hradzka
had
seen
he
wore
a
gray
tunic
and
breeches
polished
black
boots
and
a
cap
with
a
visor
and
a
metal
insignia
on
it
on
a
belt
he
carried
a
holstered
weapon
like
a
blaster
after
speaking
to
one
of
the
workers
who
pointed
hradzka
out
to
him
he
approached
the
fugitive
and
said
something
hradzka
made
gestures
at
his
mouth
and
ears
and
made
gargling
sounds
the
newcomer
shrugged
and
motioned
him
to
come
with
him
at
the
same
time
producing
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
belt
and
jingling
them
suggestively
in
a
few
seconds
hradzka
tried
to
analyze
the
situation
and
estimate
its
possibilities
the
newcomer
was
a
soldier
or
more
likely
a
policeman
since
manacles
were
a
part
of
his
equipment
evidently
since
the
evening
before
a
warning
had
been
made
public
by
means
of
communicating
devices
such
as
he
had
seen
at
the
farm
advising
people
that
a
man
of
his
description
pretending
to
be
a
should
be
detained
and
the
police
notified
it
had
been
for
that
reason
that
the
workman
had
persuaded
his
master
to
employ
hradzka
no
doubt
he
would
be
accused
of
causing
the
conditions
at
the
farm
by
sorcery
hradzka
shrugged
and
nodded
then
went
to
the
to
turn
off
the
hose
he
had
been
using
he
disconnected
it
coiled
it
and
hung
it
up
and
then
picked
up
the
then
without
warning
he
hurled
the
water
into
the
policeman
face
sprang
forward
swinging
the
bucket
by
the
bale
and
hit
the
man
on
the
head
releasing
his
grip
on
the
bucket
he
tore
the
blaster
or
whatever
it
was
from
the
holster
one
of
the
workers
swung
a
hammer
as
though
to
throw
it
hradzka
aimed
the
weapon
at
him
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
thing
belched
fire
and
kicked
back
painfully
in
his
hand
and
the
man
fell
he
used
it
again
to
drop
the
policeman
then
thrust
it
into
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
and
ran
outside
the
thing
was
not
a
blaster
at
all
he
realized
only
a
like
the
big
weapons
at
the
farm
utilizing
the
force
of
some
chemical
explosive
the
policeman
vehicle
was
standing
outside
it
was
a
small
two
wheeled
affair
having
become
familiar
with
the
principles
of
these
engines
from
examination
of
the
vehicle
of
the
farm
and
accustomed
as
he
was
to
far
more
complex
mechanisms
than
this
crude
affair
hradzka
could
see
at
a
glance
how
to
operate
it
springing
onto
the
saddle
he
kicked
away
the
folding
support
and
started
the
engine
just
as
he
did
the
master
of
the
ran
outside
one
of
the
small
in
his
hand
and
fired
several
shots
they
all
missed
but
hradzka
heard
the
whining
sound
of
the
missiles
passing
uncomfortably
close
to
him
it
was
imperative
that
he
recover
the
blaster
he
had
hidden
in
the
hollow
tree
at
the
head
of
the
valley
by
this
time
there
would
be
a
concerted
search
under
way
for
him
and
he
needed
a
better
weapon
than
the
projector
he
had
taken
from
the
policeman
he
did
not
know
how
many
shots
the
thing
contained
but
if
it
propelled
solid
missiles
by
chemical
explosion
there
could
not
have
been
more
than
five
or
six
such
charges
in
the
cylindrical
part
of
the
weapon
which
he
had
assumed
to
be
the
on
the
other
hand
his
blaster
a
weapon
of
much
greater
power
contained
enough
energy
for
five
hundred
blasts
and
with
it
were
eight
extra
giving
him
a
total
of
four
thousand
five
hundred
blasts
handling
the
vehicle
was
no
particular
problem
although
he
had
never
ridden
on
anything
of
the
sort
before
it
was
child
play
compared
to
controlling
a
hundredth
century
and
hradzka
was
a
skilled
several
times
he
passed
vehicles
on
the
road
the
passenger
vehicles
with
enclosed
cabins
and
piled
high
with
farm
produce
once
he
encountered
a
large
number
of
children
gathered
in
front
of
a
big
red
building
with
a
flagstaff
in
front
from
which
a
queer
flag
with
horizontal
red
and
white
stripes
and
a
blue
device
in
the
corner
flew
they
scattered
off
the
road
in
terror
at
his
approach
fortunately
he
hit
none
of
them
for
at
the
speed
at
which
he
was
traveling
such
a
collision
would
have
wrecked
his
light
vehicle
as
he
approached
the
farm
where
he
had
spent
the
past
few
days
he
saw
two
standing
by
the
road
one
was
a
black
one
similar
to
the
one
in
which
the
physician
had
come
to
the
farm
and
the
other
was
white
with
black
trimmings
and
bore
the
same
device
he
had
seen
on
the
cap
of
the
policeman
a
policeman
was
sitting
in
the
driver
seat
of
this
vehicle
and
another
policeman
was
standing
beside
it
breathing
smoke
with
one
of
the
white
paper
cylinders
these
people
used
in
the
two
men
were
going
about
with
a
square
black
box
to
this
box
a
tube
was
connected
by
a
wire
and
they
were
passing
the
tube
about
over
the
ground
the
policeman
who
was
standing
beside
the
vehicle
saw
him
approach
and
blew
his
whistle
then
drew
the
weapon
from
his
belt
hradzka
who
had
been
expecting
some
attempt
to
halt
him
had
let
go
the
steering
handle
and
drawn
his
own
weapon
as
the
policeman
drew
he
fired
at
him
without
observing
the
effect
of
the
shot
he
sped
on
before
he
had
rounded
the
bend
above
the
farm
several
shots
were
fired
after
him
a
mile
beyond
he
came
to
the
place
where
he
had
hidden
the
blaster
he
stopped
the
vehicle
and
jumped
off
plunging
into
the
brush
and
racing
toward
the
hollow
tree
just
as
he
reached
it
he
heard
a
vehicle
approach
and
stop
and
the
door
of
the
police
vehicle
slam
fingers
found
the
belt
of
his
blaster
he
dragged
it
out
and
buckled
it
on
tossing
away
the
missile
weapon
he
had
been
carrying
then
crouching
behind
the
tree
he
waited
a
few
moments
later
he
caught
a
movement
in
the
brush
toward
the
road
he
brought
up
the
blaster
aimed
and
squeezed
the
trigger
there
was
a
faint
bluish
glow
at
the
muzzle
and
a
blast
of
energy
tore
through
the
brush
smashing
the
molecular
structure
of
everything
that
stood
in
the
way
there
was
an
involuntary
shout
of
alarm
from
the
direction
of
the
road
at
least
one
of
the
policemen
had
escaped
the
blast
hradzka
holstered
his
weapon
and
crept
away
for
some
distance
keeping
under
cover
then
turned
and
waited
for
some
sign
of
the
presence
of
his
enemies
for
some
time
nothing
happened
he
decided
to
turn
hunter
against
the
men
who
were
hunting
him
he
started
back
in
the
direction
of
the
road
making
a
wide
circle
flitting
silently
from
rock
to
bush
and
from
bush
to
tree
stopping
often
to
look
and
listen
this
finally
brought
him
upon
one
of
the
policemen
and
almost
terminated
his
flight
at
the
same
time
he
must
have
grown
and
careless
suddenly
a
weapon
roared
and
a
missile
smashed
through
the
brush
inches
from
his
face
the
shot
had
come
from
his
left
and
a
little
to
the
rear
whirling
he
blasted
four
times
in
rapid
succession
then
turned
and
fled
for
a
few
yards
dropping
and
crawling
behind
a
rock
when
he
looked
back
he
could
see
wisps
of
smoke
rising
from
the
shattered
trees
and
bushes
which
had
absorbed
the
of
his
weapon
and
he
caught
a
faint
odor
of
burned
flesh
one
of
his
pursuers
at
least
would
pursue
him
no
longer
he
slipped
away
down
into
the
tangle
of
ravines
and
hollows
in
which
he
had
wandered
the
day
before
his
arrival
at
the
farm
for
the
time
being
he
felt
safe
and
finally
confident
that
he
was
not
being
pursued
he
stopped
to
rest
the
place
where
he
stopped
seemed
familiar
and
he
looked
about
in
a
moment
he
recognized
the
little
stream
the
pool
where
he
had
bathed
his
feet
the
clump
of
seedling
pines
under
which
he
had
slept
he
even
found
the
wrapping
from
the
food
concentrate
capsule
but
there
had
been
a
change
since
the
night
when
he
had
slept
here
then
the
young
pines
had
been
green
and
alive
now
they
were
blighted
and
their
needles
had
turned
brown
hradzka
stood
for
a
long
time
looking
at
them
it
was
the
same
blight
that
had
touched
the
plants
around
the
farmhouse
and
here
among
the
pine
needles
on
the
ground
lay
a
dead
bird
it
took
some
time
for
him
to
admit
to
himself
the
implications
of
vegetation
the
chickens
the
cow
the
farmer
and
his
wife
had
all
sickened
and
died
he
had
been
in
this
place
and
now
when
he
had
returned
he
found
that
death
had
followed
him
here
too
during
the
early
centuries
of
the
atomic
era
he
knew
there
had
been
great
wars
the
stories
of
which
had
survived
even
to
the
hundredth
century
among
the
weapons
that
had
been
used
there
had
been
artificial
plagues
and
epidemics
caused
by
new
types
of
bacteria
developed
in
laboratories
against
which
the
victims
had
possessed
no
protection
those
germs
and
viruses
had
persisted
for
centuries
and
gradually
had
lost
their
power
to
harm
mankind
suppose
now
that
he
had
brought
some
of
them
back
with
him
to
a
century
before
they
had
been
developed
suppose
that
was
that
he
were
a
human
he
thought
of
the
vermin
that
had
infested
the
clothing
he
had
taken
from
the
man
he
had
killed
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
they
had
not
troubled
him
after
the
first
day
there
was
a
throbbing
mechanical
sound
somewhere
in
the
air
he
looked
about
and
finally
identified
its
source
a
small
aircraft
had
come
over
the
valley
from
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
was
circling
lazily
overhead
he
froze
shrinking
back
under
a
as
long
as
he
remained
motionless
he
would
not
be
seen
and
soon
the
thing
would
go
away
he
was
beginning
to
understand
why
the
search
for
him
was
being
pressed
so
relentlessly
as
long
as
he
remained
alive
he
was
a
menace
to
everybody
in
this
first
century
world
he
got
out
his
supply
of
food
concentrates
saw
that
he
had
only
three
capsules
left
and
put
them
away
again
for
a
long
time
he
sat
under
the
dying
tree
chewing
on
a
twig
and
thinking
there
must
be
some
way
in
which
he
could
overcome
or
even
utilize
his
inherent
deadliness
to
these
people
he
might
find
some
isolated
community
conceal
himself
near
it
invade
it
at
night
and
infect
it
and
then
when
everybody
was
dead
move
in
and
take
it
for
himself
but
was
there
any
such
isolated
community
the
farmhouse
where
he
had
worked
had
been
fairly
remote
yet
its
inhabitants
had
been
in
communication
with
the
outside
world
and
the
physician
had
come
immediately
in
response
to
their
call
for
help
the
little
aircraft
had
been
circling
overhead
directly
above
the
place
where
he
lay
hidden
for
a
while
hradzka
was
afraid
it
had
spotted
him
and
was
debating
the
advisability
of
using
his
blaster
on
it
then
it
banked
turned
and
went
away
he
watched
it
circle
over
the
valley
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
got
to
his
feet
almost
at
once
there
was
a
new
sound
a
multiple
throbbing
at
a
quick
snarling
tempo
that
hinted
at
enormous
power
growing
louder
each
second
hradzka
stiffened
and
drew
his
blaster
as
he
did
five
more
aircraft
swooped
over
the
crest
of
the
mountain
and
came
rushing
down
toward
him
not
aimlessly
but
as
though
they
knew
exactly
where
he
was
as
they
approached
the
leading
edges
of
their
wings
sparkled
with
light
branches
began
flying
from
the
trees
about
him
and
there
was
a
loud
hammering
noise
he
aimed
a
little
in
front
of
them
and
began
blasting
a
wing
flew
from
one
of
the
aircraft
and
it
plunged
downward
another
came
apart
in
the
air
a
third
burst
into
flames
the
other
two
zoomed
upward
quickly
hradzka
swung
his
blaster
after
them
blasting
again
and
again
he
hit
a
fourth
with
a
blast
of
energy
knocking
it
to
pieces
and
then
the
fifth
was
out
of
range
he
blasted
at
it
twice
but
without
effect
a
was
only
good
for
a
thousand
yards
at
the
most
holstering
his
weapon
he
hurried
away
following
the
stream
and
keeping
under
cover
of
trees
the
last
of
the
attacking
aircraft
had
gone
away
but
the
little
was
still
circling
about
well
out
of
once
or
twice
hradzka
was
compelled
to
stay
hidden
for
some
time
not
knowing
the
nature
of
the
pilot
ability
to
detect
him
it
was
during
one
of
these
waits
that
the
next
phase
of
the
attack
developed
it
began
like
the
last
one
with
a
distant
roar
that
swelled
in
volume
until
it
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
world
then
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
feet
out
of
the
new
attackers
swept
into
sight
there
must
have
been
fifty
of
them
huge
tapering
things
with
wings
flying
in
close
formation
wave
after
wave
he
stood
and
stared
at
them
amazed
he
had
never
imagined
that
such
aircraft
existed
in
the
first
century
then
a
screaming
sound
cut
through
the
roar
of
the
propellers
and
for
an
instant
he
saw
countless
small
specks
in
the
sky
falling
downward
the
first
landed
in
the
young
pines
where
he
had
fought
against
the
first
air
attack
great
gouts
of
flame
shot
upward
and
smoke
and
flying
earth
and
debris
hradzka
turned
and
started
to
run
another
salvo
fell
in
front
of
him
he
veered
to
the
left
and
plunged
on
through
the
undergrowth
now
the
bombs
were
falling
all
about
him
deafening
him
with
their
thunder
shaking
him
with
concussion
he
dodged
frightened
as
the
trunk
of
a
tree
came
crashing
down
beside
him
then
something
hit
him
across
the
back
knocking
him
flat
for
a
moment
he
lay
stunned
then
tried
to
rise
as
he
did
a
searing
light
filled
his
eyes
and
a
wave
of
intolerable
heat
swept
over
him
then
darkness
no
zarvas
pol
kradzy
zago
repeated
hradzka
will
not
return
the
was
sabotaged
so
by
you
the
soldier
asked
the
scientist
nodded
i
knew
the
purpose
for
which
he
intended
it
hradzka
was
not
content
with
having
enslaved
a
whole
solar
system
he
hungered
to
bring
tyranny
and
serfdom
to
all
the
past
and
all
the
future
as
well
he
wanted
to
be
master
not
only
of
the
present
but
of
the
centuries
that
were
and
were
to
be
as
well
i
never
took
part
in
politics
zarvas
pol
i
had
no
hand
in
this
revolt
but
i
could
not
be
party
to
such
a
crime
as
hradzka
contemplated
when
it
lay
within
my
power
to
prevent
it
the
machine
will
take
him
out
of
our
continuum
or
back
to
a
time
when
this
planet
was
a
swirling
cloud
of
flaming
gas
zarvas
pol
asked
kradzy
zago
shook
his
head
no
the
unit
is
not
powerful
enough
for
that
it
will
only
take
him
about
ten
thousand
years
into
the
past
but
then
when
it
stops
the
machine
will
destroy
itself
it
may
destroy
hradzka
with
it
or
he
may
escape
but
if
he
does
he
will
be
left
stranded
ten
thousand
years
ago
when
he
can
do
us
no
harm
actually
it
did
not
operate
as
he
imagined
and
there
is
an
infinitely
small
chance
that
he
could
have
returned
to
our
in
any
event
but
i
wanted
to
insure
against
even
so
small
a
chance
we
ca
be
sure
of
that
zarvas
pol
objected
he
may
know
more
about
the
machine
than
you
think
enough
more
to
build
another
like
it
so
you
must
build
me
a
machine
and
i
take
back
a
party
of
volunteers
and
hunt
him
down
that
would
not
be
necessary
and
you
would
only
share
his
fate
then
apparently
changing
the
subject
kradzy
zago
asked
tell
me
zarvas
pol
have
you
never
heard
the
legends
of
the
deadly
radiations
general
zarvas
smiled
who
has
not
every
cadet
at
the
college
dreams
of
them
to
use
as
a
weapon
but
nobody
ever
has
we
hear
these
tales
of
how
in
the
early
days
atomic
engines
and
piles
and
emitted
particles
which
were
utterly
deadly
which
would
make
anything
with
which
they
came
in
contact
deadly
which
would
bring
a
horrible
death
to
any
human
being
but
these
are
only
myths
all
the
ancient
experiments
have
been
duplicated
time
and
again
and
the
deadly
radiation
effect
has
never
been
observed
some
say
that
it
is
a
mere
terror
tale
some
say
that
the
deaths
were
caused
by
fear
of
atomic
energy
when
it
was
still
unfamiliar
others
contend
that
the
fundamental
nature
of
atomic
energy
has
altered
by
the
degeneration
of
the
fissionable
matter
for
my
own
part
i
not
enough
of
a
scientist
to
have
an
opinion
the
old
one
smiled
wanly
none
of
these
theories
are
correct
in
the
beginning
of
the
atomic
era
the
deadly
radiations
existed
they
still
exist
but
they
are
no
longer
deadly
because
all
life
on
this
planet
has
adapted
itself
to
such
radiations
and
all
living
things
are
now
immune
to
them
and
hradzka
has
returned
to
a
time
when
such
immunity
did
not
exist
but
would
that
not
be
to
his
advantage
remember
general
that
man
has
been
using
atomic
energy
for
ten
thousand
years
our
whole
world
has
become
drenched
with
radioactivity
the
planet
the
seas
the
atmosphere
and
every
living
thing
are
all
radioactive
now
radioactivity
is
as
natural
to
us
as
the
air
we
breathe
now
you
remember
hearing
of
the
great
wars
of
the
first
centuries
of
the
atomic
era
in
which
whole
nations
were
wiped
out
leaving
only
hundreds
of
survivors
out
of
millions
you
no
doubt
think
that
such
tales
are
products
of
ignorant
and
barbaric
imagination
but
i
assure
you
they
are
literally
true
it
was
not
the
of
a
few
bombs
which
created
such
holocausts
but
the
radiations
released
by
the
bombs
and
those
who
survived
to
carry
on
the
race
were
men
and
women
whose
systems
resisted
the
radiations
and
they
transmitted
to
their
progeny
that
power
of
resistance
in
many
cases
their
children
were
mutants
not
monsters
although
there
were
many
of
them
too
which
did
not
survive
but
humans
who
were
immune
to
radioactivity
an
interesting
theory
kradzy
zago
the
soldier
commented
and
one
which
conforms
both
to
what
we
know
of
atomic
energy
and
to
the
ancient
legends
then
you
would
say
that
those
radiations
are
still
deadly
to
the
exactly
and
hradzka
his
body
emitting
those
radiations
has
returned
to
the
first
century
of
the
atomic
era
to
a
world
without
immunity
general
zarvas
smile
vanished
man
he
cried
in
horror
you
have
loosed
a
carrier
of
death
among
those
innocent
people
of
the
past
kradzy
zago
nodded
that
is
true
i
estimate
that
hradzka
will
probably
cause
the
death
of
a
hundred
or
so
people
before
he
is
dealt
with
but
dealt
with
he
will
be
tell
me
general
if
a
man
should
appear
now
out
of
nowhere
spreading
a
strange
and
horrible
plague
wherever
he
went
what
would
you
do
why
i
hunt
him
down
and
kill
him
general
zarvas
replied
not
for
anything
he
did
but
for
the
menace
he
was
and
then
i
cover
his
body
with
a
mass
of
concrete
bigger
than
this
palace
precisely
kradzy
zago
smiled
and
the
military
commanders
and
political
leaders
of
the
first
century
were
no
less
ruthless
or
efficient
than
you
you
know
how
atomic
energy
was
first
used
there
was
an
ancient
nation
upon
the
ruins
of
whose
cities
we
have
built
our
own
which
was
famed
for
its
idealistic
humanitarianism
yet
that
nation
treacherously
attacked
created
the
first
atomic
bombs
in
self
defense
and
used
them
it
is
among
the
people
of
that
nation
that
hradzka
has
emerged
but
would
they
recognize
him
as
the
cause
of
the
calamity
he
brings
among
them
of
course
he
will
emerge
at
the
time
when
atomic
energy
is
first
being
used
they
will
have
detectors
for
the
deadly
radiations
detectors
we
know
nothing
of
today
for
a
detection
instrument
must
be
free
from
the
thing
it
is
intended
to
detect
and
today
everything
is
radioactive
it
will
be
a
day
or
so
before
they
discover
what
is
happening
to
them
and
not
a
few
will
die
in
that
time
i
fear
but
once
they
have
found
out
what
is
killing
their
people
hradzka
days
no
his
hours
will
be
numbered
a
