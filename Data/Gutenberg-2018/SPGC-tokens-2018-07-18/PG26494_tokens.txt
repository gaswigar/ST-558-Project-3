father
peter
peter
vera
my
lad
has
got
too
many
ideas
i
do
think
much
of
ideas
myself
i
got
on
well
enough
in
life
without
why
should
my
children
there
dmitri
could
have
stayed
here
and
kept
the
inn
many
a
young
lad
would
have
jumped
at
the
offer
in
these
hard
times
but
he
featherhead
of
a
boy
must
needs
go
off
to
moscow
to
study
the
law
what
does
he
want
knowing
about
the
law
let
a
man
do
his
duty
say
i
and
no
one
will
trouble
him
ay
but
father
peter
they
say
a
good
lawyer
can
break
the
law
as
often
as
he
likes
and
no
one
can
say
him
nay
peter
that
is
about
all
they
are
good
for
and
there
he
stays
and
has
not
written
a
line
to
us
for
four
months
now
a
good
son
that
eh
come
come
father
peter
dmitri
letters
must
have
gone
astray
perhaps
the
new
postman
ca
read
he
looks
stupid
enough
and
dmitri
why
he
was
the
best
fellow
in
the
village
do
you
remember
how
he
shot
the
bear
at
the
barn
in
the
great
winter
peter
ay
it
was
a
good
shot
i
never
did
a
better
myself
and
as
for
dancing
he
tired
out
three
fiddlers
christmas
come
two
years
peter
ay
ay
he
was
a
merry
lad
it
is
the
girl
that
has
the
seriousness
she
goes
about
as
solemn
as
a
priest
for
days
at
a
time
vera
is
always
thinking
of
others
peter
there
is
her
mistake
boy
let
god
and
our
little
father
look
to
the
world
it
is
none
of
my
work
to
mend
my
neighbour
thatch
why
last
winter
old
michael
was
frozen
to
death
in
his
sleigh
in
the
snowstorm
and
his
wife
and
children
starved
afterwards
when
the
hard
times
came
but
what
business
was
it
of
mine
i
did
make
the
world
let
god
and
the
czar
look
to
it
and
then
the
blight
came
and
the
black
plague
with
it
and
the
priests
could
bury
the
people
fast
enough
and
they
lay
dead
on
the
roads
men
and
women
both
but
what
business
was
it
of
mine
i
did
make
the
world
let
god
and
the
czar
look
to
it
or
two
autumns
ago
when
the
river
overflowed
on
a
sudden
and
the
children
school
was
carried
away
and
drowned
every
girl
and
boy
in
it
i
did
make
the
world
let
god
and
the
czar
look
to
it
mich
but
father
peter
peter
no
no
boy
no
man
could
live
if
he
took
his
neighbour
pack
on
his
shoulders
vera
in
peasant
well
my
girl

been
long
enough
away
where
is
the
letter
vera
there
is
none
father

but
there
will
be
one
father

curse
him
for
an
ungrateful
son
vera
oh

say
that
he
must
be
sick
peter

how
dare
you
say
that
of
him
father

know
that
is
not
true
peter
where
does
the
money
go

gave
dmitri
half
his
mother
fortune
to
bring
with
him
to
pay
the
lawyer
folk
of
moscow
he
has
only
written
three
times
and
every
time
for
more
money
he
got
it
not
at
my
wish
but
at
hers
to
and
now
for
five
months
close
on
six
almost
we
have
heard
nothing
from
him
vera
father
he
will
come
back
peter
ay
the
prodigals
always
return
but
let
him
never
darken
my
doors
again
vera
down
some
evil
has
come
on
him
he
must
be
dead
oh
michael
i
am
so
wretched
about
dmitri
will
you
never
love
any
one
but
him
vera
vera
i
do
know
there
is
so
much
else
to
do
in
the
world
but
love
mich
nothing
else
worth
doing
vera
peter
what
noise
is
that
vera
metallic
clink
is
vera
and
going
to
the
i
do
know
father
it
is
not

made
bustle
vera
bustle
i
die
a
rich
man
after
all
there
will
be
no
lack
of
good
customers

any
of

one
hears
strange
stories
about
him
they
say
he
loves
the
people

a
king
son
never
does
that
you
can
not
breed
them
like
that
pres
since
he
came
back
from
abroad
a
year

his
father
has
kept
him
in
close
prison
in
his
palace
an
excellent
training
to
make
him
a
tyrant
in
his
turn
but
is
there
any
news
i
say
pres
a
council
is
to
be
held
at
four
on
some
secret
business
the
spies
can
not
find
out
a
council
in
a
king
palace
is
sure
to
be
about
some
bloody
work
or
other
but
in
what
room
is
this
council
to
be
held
pres
from
in
the
yellow
tapestry
room
called
after
the
empress
catherine
mich
i
care
not
for
such
names
i
would
know
where
it
is
pres
i
can
not
tell
michael
i
know
more
about
the
insides
of
prisons
than
of
palaces
suddenly
to
where
is
this
room
alexis
alexis
it
is
on
the
first
floor
looking
out
on
to
the
inner
courtyard
but
why
do
you
ask
michael
mich
nothing
nothing
boy
i
merely
take
a
great
interest
in
the
czar
life
and
movements
and
i
knew
you
could
tell
me
all
about
the
palace
every
poor
student
of
medicine
in
moscow
knows
all
about
houses
it
is
their
duty
is
it
not
alexis
can
michael
suspect
me
there
is
something
strange
in
his
manner
why
does
she
come
the
whole
fire
of
revolution
seems
fallen
into
dull
ashes
when
she
is
not
here
have
you
cured
many
patients
lately
at
your
hospital
boy
alex
there
is
one
who
lies
sick
to
death
i
would
fain
cure
but
can
not
ay
and
who
is
that
alex
russia
our
mother
mich
the
curing
of
russia
is
surgeon
business
and
must
be
done
by
the
knife
i
like
not
your
method
of
medicine
pres
professor
we
have
read
the
proofs
of
your
last
article
it
is
very
good
indeed
what
is
it
about
professor
professor
the
subject
my
good
brother
is
assassination
considered
as
a
method
of
political
reform
mich
i
think
little
of
pen
and
ink
in
revolutions
one
dagger
will
do
more
than
a
hundred
epigrams
still
let
us
read
this
scholar
last
production
give
it
to
me
i
will
read
it
myself
prof
brother
you
never
mind
your
stops
let
alexis
read
it
ay
he
is
as
tripping
of
speech
as
if
he
were
some
young
aristocrat
but
for
my
own
part
i
care
not
for
the
stops
so
that
the
sense
be
plain
alex
the
past
has
belonged
to
the
tyrant
and
he
has
defiled
it
ours
is
the
future
and
we
shall
make
it
holy
ay
let
us
make
the
future
holy
let
there
be
one
revolution
at
least
which
is
not
bred
in
crime
nurtured
in
murder
mich
they
have
spoken
to
us
by
the
sword
and
by
the
sword
we
shall
answer
you
are
too
delicate
for
us
alexis
there
should
be
none
here
but
men
whose
hands
are
rough
with
labour
or
red
with
blood
pres

is
the
bravest

even
our
brothers
will
be
taken
from
their
houses
shot
in
the
streets
like
dogs
sent
away
to
die
in
the
snow
to
starve
in
the
dungeon
to
rot
in
the
mine
do
you
know
what
martial
law
means
it
means
the
strangling
of
a
whole
nation
the
streets

be
filled
with
soldiers
night
and
day
there
will
be
sentinels
at
every
door
no
man
dare
walk
abroad
now
but
the
spy
or
the
traitor
cooped
up
in
the
dens
we
hide
in
meeting
by
stealth
speaking
with
bated
breath
what
good
can
we
do
now
for
russia
pres
we
can
suffer
at
least
vera
we
have
done
that
too
much
already
the
hour
is
now
come
to
annihilate
and
to
revenge
pres
up
to
this
the
people
have
borne
everything
vera
because
they
have
understood
nothing
but
now
we
the
nihilists
have
given
them
the
tree
of
knowledge
to
eat
of
and
the
day
of
silent
suffering
is
over
for
russia
mich
martial
law
vera
this
is
fearful
tidings
you
bring
pres
it
is
the
death
warrant
of
liberty
in
russia
vera
or
the
tocsin
of
revolution
are
you
sure
it
is
true
vera
here
is
the
proclamation
i
stole
it
myself
at
the
ball
from
a
young
fool
one
of
prince
paul
secretaries
who
had
been
given
it
to
copy
it
was
that
which
made
me
so
late
hands
proclamation
to
michael
who
reads
to
ensure
the
public
safety
martial
law
by
order
of
the
czar
father
of
his
people
the
father
of
his
people
vera
ay
a
father
whose
name
shall
not
be
hallowed
whose
kingdom
shall
change
to
a
republic
whose
trespasses
shall
not
be
forgiven
him
because
he
has
robbed
us
of
our
daily
bread
with
whom
is
neither
might
nor
right
nor
glory
now
or
for
ever
pres
it
must
be
about
this
that
the
council
meet
it
has
not
yet
been
signed
alex
it
shall
not
be
while
i
have
a
tongue
to
plead
with
or
while
i
have
hands
to
smite
with
vera
martial
law
o
god
how
easy
it
is
for
a
king
to
kill
his
people
by
thousands
but
we
can
not
rid
ourselves
of
one
crowned
man
in
europe
what
is
there
of
awful
majesty
in
these
men
which
makes
the
hand
unsteady
the
dagger
treacherous
the
harmless
are
they
not
men
of
like
passions
with
ourselves
vulnerable
to
the
same
diseases
of
flesh
and
blood
not
different
from
our
own
what
made
olgiati
tremble
at
the
supreme
crisis
of
that
roman
life
and
guido
nerve
fail
him
when
he
should
have
been
of
iron
and
of
steel
a
plague
i
say
on
these
fools
of
naples
berlin
and
spain
methinks
that
if
i
stood
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
crowned
men
my
eye
would
see
more
clearly
my
aim
be
more
sure
my
whole
body
gain
a
strength
and
power
that
was
not
my
own
oh
to
think
what
stands
between
us
and
freedom
in
europe
a
few
old
men
wrinkled
feeble
tottering
dotards
whom
a
boy
could
strangle
for
a
ducat
or
a
woman
stab
in
a
and
these
are
the
things
that
keep
us
from
democracy
that
keep
us
from
liberty
but
now
methinks
the
brood
of
men
is
dead
and
the
dull
earth
grown
sick
of
else
would
no
crowned
dog
pollute
god
air
by
living
omnes
try
us
try
us
try
us
we
shall
try
thee
too
some
day

overthrow
a
dynasty

head

to
one
corner
of
the
stage

these
dull
russian
peasants
care
little
for
our
proclamations
and
less
for
our
martyrdoms
when
the
blow
is
struck
it
must
be
from
the
town

as
a
student

law
alex
i
president
ay
you
you
knew
it
none
better
such
weapons
as

a
day

you
not
tell
us
of
it
a
week
ago
there
had
been
time
to
lay
the
mine
to
raise
the
barricade
to
strike
one
blow
at
least
for
liberty
but
now
the
hour
is
past
it
is
too
late

too
late

it
a
secret
from
us
i
say
alex
now
by
the
hand
of
freedom
michael
my
brother
you
wrong

i
knew
nothing
of
this
hideous
law
by
my
soul
my
brothers
i
knew
not
of
it
how
should
i
know
because
you
are
a
traitor

you
go
when
you
left
us
the
night
of
our
last
meeting
here
alex
to
mine
own
house
michael
liar
i
was
on
your
track
you
left
here
an
hour
after
midnight
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
you
crossed
the
river
in
a
boat
a
mile
below
the
second
bridge
and
gave
the
ferryman
a
gold
piece
you
the
poor
student
of
medicine
you
doubled
back
twice
and
hid
in
an
archway
so
long
that
i
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
stab
you
at
once
only
that
i
am
fond
of
hunting
so
you
thought
that
you
had
baffled
all
pursuit
did
you
fool
i
am
a
bloodhound
that
never
loses
the
scent
i
followed
you
from
street
to
street
at
last
i
saw
you
pass
swiftly
across
the
place
isaac
whisper
to
the
guards
the
secret
password
enter
the
palace
by
a
private
door
with
your
own
key
conspirators
the
palace
vera
alexis
mich
i
waited
all
through
the
dreary
watches
of
our
long
russian
night
i
waited
that
i
might
kill
you
with
your
judas
hire
still
hot
in
your
hand
but
you
never
came
out
you
never
left
that
palace
at
all
i
saw
the
sun
rise
through
the
yellow
fog
over
the
murky
town
i
saw
a
new
day
of
oppression
dawn
on
russia
but
you
never
came
out
so
you
pass
nights
in
the
palace
do
you
you
know
the
password
for
the
guards
you
have
a
key
to
a
secret
door
oh
you
are
a
spy
you
are
a
spy
i
never
trusted
you
with
your
soft
white
hands
your
curled
hair
your
pretty
graces
you
have
no
mark
of
suffering
about
you
you

not

who

with
such
a
tripping
tongue
to
your
betters
takes
his
mask
his
imperial
highness
the
czarevitch
omnes
the
czarevitch
it

all
over
pres

up
to
the
soldiers
why
did
you
not
let
me
kill
him
come
we
must
fight
to

death
for

vera

he

not

alex
a
whim
of
mine
general
you
know
how
my
father
keeps
me
from
the
world
and
imprisons
me
in
the
palace
i
should
really
be
bored
to
death
if
i
could
not
get
out
at
night
in
disguise
sometimes
and
have
some
romantic
adventure
in
town
i
fell
in
with
these
honest
folks
a
few
hours
ago
gen
but
your
highness
alex
oh
they
are
excellent
actors
i
assure
you
if
you
had
come
in
ten
minutes
ago
you
would
have
witnessed
a
most
interesting
scene
gen
actors
are
they
prince
alex
ay
and
very
ambitious
actors
too
they
only
care
to
play
before
kings
gen
i
faith
your
highness
i
was
in
hopes
i
had
made
a
good
haul
of
nihilists
alex
nihilists
in
moscow
general
with
you
as
head
of
the
police
impossible
gen
so
i
always
tell
your
imperial
father
but
i
heard
at
the
council
that
that
woman
vera
sabouroff
the
head
of
them
had
been
seen
in
this
very
city
the
emperor
face
turned
as
white
as
the
snow
outside
i
think
i
never
saw
such
terror
in
any
man
before
alex
she
is
a
dangerous
woman
then
this
vera
sabouroff
gen
the
most
dangerous
in
all
europe
alex
did
you
ever
see
her
general
why
five
years
ago
when
i
was
a
plain
colonel
i
remember
her
your
highness
a
common
waiting
girl
in
an
inn
if
i
had
known
then
what
she
was
going
to
turn
out
i
would
have
flogged
her
to
death
on
the
roadside
she
is
not
a
woman
at
all
she
is
a
sort
of
devil
for
the
last
eighteen
months
i
have
been
hunting
her
and
caught
sight
of
her
once
last
september
outside
odessa
alex
how
did
you
let
her
go
general
gen
i
was
by
myself
and
she
shot
one
of
my
horses
just
as
i
was
gaining
on
her
if
i
see
her
again
i
sha
miss
my
chance
the
emperor
has
put
twenty
thousand
roubles
on
her
head
alex
i
hope
you
will
get
it
general
but
meanwhile
you
are
frightening
these
honest
people
out
of
their
wits
and
disturbing
the
tragedy
good
night
general
gen
yes
but
i
should
like
to
see
their
faces
your
highness
alex
no
general
you
must
not
ask
that
you
know
how
these
gipsies
hate
to
be
stared
at
gen
yes
but
your
highness
alex
general
they
are
my
friends
that
is
enough
and
general
not
a
word
of
this
little
adventure
here
you
understand
i
shall
rely
on
you
gen
i
shall
not
forget
prince
but
shall
we
not
see
you
back
to
the
palace
the
state
ball
is
almost
over
and
you
are
expected
alex
i
shall
be
there
but
i
shall
return
alone
remember
not
a
word
about
my
strolling
players
or
your
pretty
gipsy
eh
prince
your
pretty
gipsy
i
faith
i
should
like
to
see
her
before
i
go
she
has
such
fine
eyes
through
her
mask
well
good
night
your
highness
good
night
alex
good
night
general
general
and
the
vera
off
her
saved
and
by
you
alex
her
brothers
you
trust
me
now
tableau
end
of
act
i
act
ii
chamber
in
the
emperor
palace
hung
with
yellow
tapestry
table
with
chair
of
state
set
for
the
czar
window
behind
opening
on
to
a
balcony
as
the
scene
progresses
the
light
outside
gets
prince
paul
maraloffski
prince
petrovitch
count
rouvaloff
baron
raff
count
petouchof
prince
petro
so
our
young
czarevitch
has
been
forgiven
at
last
and
is
to
take
his
seat
here
again
prince
paul
yes
if
that
is
not
meant
as
an
extra
punishment
for
my
own
part
at
least
i
find
these
cabinet
councils
extremely
exhausting
prince
petro
naturally
you
are
always
speaking
prince
paul
no
i
think
it
must
be
that
i
have
to
listen
sometimes
count
still
anything
is
better
than
being
kept
in
a
sort
of
prison
like
he
was
never
allowed
to
go
out
into
the
world
prince
paul
my
dear
count
for
romantic
young
people
like
he
is
the
world
always
looks
best
at
a
distance
and
a
prison
where
one
allowed
to
order
one
own
dinner
is
not
at
all
a
bad
place
the
czarevitch
the
courtiers
ah
good
afternoon
prince
your
highness
is
looking
a
little
pale
czare
after
a
i
want
change
of
air
prince
paul
a
most
revolutionary
sentiment
your
imperial
father
would
highly
disapprove
of
any
reforms
with
the
thermometer
in
russia
czare
my
imperial
father
had
kept
me
for
six
months
in
this
dungeon
of
a
palace
this
morning
he
has
me
suddenly
woke
up
to
see
some
wretched
nihilists
hung
it
sickened
me
the
bloody
butchery
though
it
was
a
noble
thing
to
see
how
well
these
men
can
die
prince
paul
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
prince
you
will
understand
that
there
are
few
things
easier
than
to
live
badly
and
to
die
well
czare
easy
to
die
well
a
lesson
experience
can
not
have
taught
you
whatever
you
may
know
of
a
bad
life
prince
paul
his
experience
the
name
men
give
to
their
mistakes
i
never
commit
any
czare
no
crimes
are
more
in
your
line
prince
petro
the
the
emperor
was
a
good
deal
agitated
about
your
late
appearance
at
the
ball
last
night
prince
count
i
believe
he
thought
the
nihilists
had
broken
into
the
palace
and
carried
you
off
baron
raff
if
they
had
you
would
have
missed
a
charming
dance
prince
paul
and
an
excellent
supper
gringoire
really
excelled
himself
in
his
salad
ah
you
may
laugh
baron
but
to
make
a
good
salad
is
a
much
more
difficult
thing
than
cooking
accounts
to
make
a
good
salad
is
to
be
a
brilliant
diplomatist
the
problem
is
so
entirely
the
same
in
both
cases
to
know
exactly
how
much
oil
one
must
put
with
vinegar
baron
raff
a
cook
and
a
diplomatist
an
excellent
parallel
if
i
had
a
son
who
was
a
fool
i
make
him
one
or
the
other
prince
paul
i
see
your
father
did
not
hold
the
same
opinion
baron
but
believe
me
you
are
wrong
to
run
down
cookery
for
myself
the
only
immortality
i
desire
is
to
invent
a
new
sauce
i
have
never
had
time
enough
to
think
seriously
about
it
but
i
feel
it
is
in
me
i
feel
it
is
in
me
czare
you
have
certainly
missed
your
prince
paul
the
would
have
suited
you
much
better
than
the
grand
cross
of
honour
but
you
know
you
could
never
have
worn
your
white
apron
well
you
would
have
soiled
it
too
soon
your
hands
are
not
clean
enough
prince
paul
que
voulez
vous
i
manage
your
business
czare
you
mismanage
my
father
business
you
mean
evil
genius
of
his
life
that
you
are
before
you
came
there
was
some
love
left
in
him
it
is
you
who
have
embittered
his
nature
poured
into
his
ear
the
poison
of
treacherous
counsel
made
him
hated
by
the
whole
people
made
him
what
he
is
a
tyrant
courtiers
look
significantly
at
each
prince
paul
i
see
your
highness
does
want
change
of
air
but
i
have
been
an
eldest
son
myself
a
i
know
what
it
is
when
a
father
wo
die
to
please
one
czarevitch
goes
to
the
top
of
the
stage
and
leans
against
the
window
looking
prince
petro
baron
foolish
boy
he
will
be
sent
into
exile
or
worse
if
he
is
not
careful
baron
raff
yes
what
a
mistake
it
is
to
be
sincere
prince
petro
the
only
folly
you
have
never
committed
baron
baron
raff
one
has
only
one
head
you
know
prince
prince
paul
my
dear
baron
your
head
is
the
last
thing
any
one
would
wish
to
take
from
you
out
snuffbox
and
offers
it
to
prince
prince
petro
thanks
prince
thanks
prince
paul
very
delicate
is
it
i
get
it
direct
from
paris
but
under
this
vulgar
republic
everything
has
degenerated
over
there
cotelettes
√†
vanished
of
course
with
the
bourbon
and
omelettes
went
out
with
the
orleanists
la
belle
france
is
entirely
ruined
prince
through
bad
morals
and
worse
cookery
the
marquis
de
ah
marquis
i
trust
madame
la
marquise
is
well
marquis
de
you
ought
to
know
better
than
i
do
prince
paul
you
see
more
her
prince
paul
perhaps
i
see
more
her
marquis
your
wife
is
really
a
charming
woman
so
full
of
and
so
satirical
too
she
talks
continually
of
you
when
we
are
together
prince
petro
at
the
his
majesty
is
a
little
late
is
he
not
prince
paul
what
has
happened
to
you
my
dear
petrovitch
you
seem
quite
out
of
sorts
you
have
quarrelled
with
your
cook
i
hope
what
a
tragedy
that
would
be
for
you
you
would
lose
all
your
friends
prince
petro
i
fear
i
would
be
so
fortunate
as
that
you
forget
i
would
still
have
my
purse
but
you
are
wrong
for
once
my
chef
and
i
are
on
excellent
terms
prince
paul
then
your
creditors
or
mademoiselle
vera
sabouroff
have
been
writing
to
you
i
find
both
of
them
such
excellent
correspondents
but
really
you
need
be
alarmed
i
find
the
most
violent
proclamations
from
the
executive
committee
as
they
call
it
left
all
over
my
house
i
never
read
them
they
are
so
badly
spelt
as
a
rule
prince
petro
wrong
again
prince
the
nihilists
leave
me
alone
for
some
reason
or
other
prince
paul
ah
true
i
forgot
indifference
is
the
revenge
the
world
takes
on
mediocrities
prince
petro
i
am
bored
with
life
prince
since
the
opera
season
ended
i
have
been
a
perpetual
martyr
to
ennui
prince
paul
the
maladie
du
si√®cle
you
want
a
new
excitement
prince
let
me
see
you
have
been
married
twice
already
suppose
you
try
falling
in
love
for
once
baron
prince
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
lately
prince
paul
you
surprise
me
very
much
baron
baron
i
can
not
understand
your
nature
prince
paul
if
my
nature
had
been
made
to
suit
your
comprehension
rather
than
my
own
requirements
i
am
afraid
i
would
have
made
a
very
poor
figure
in
the
world
count
there
seems
to
be
nothing
in
life
about
which
you
would
not
jest
prince
paul
ah
my
dear
count
life
is
much
too
important
a
thing
ever
to
talk
seriously
about
it
czare
back
from
the
i
do
think
prince
nature
is
such
a
mystery
he
would
stab
his
best
friend
for
the
sake
of
writing
an
epigram
on
his
tombstone
or
experiencing
a
new
sensation
prince
paul
parbleu
i
would
sooner
lose
my
best
friend
than
my
worst
enemy
to
have
friends
you
know
one
need
only
be
but
when
a
man
has
no
enemy
left
there
must
be
something
mean
about
him
czare
if
to
have
enemies
is
a
measure
of
greatness
then
you
must
be
a
colossus
indeed
prince
prince
paul
yes
i
know
i
the
most
hated
man
in
russia
except
your
father
except
your
father
of
course
prince
he
does
seem
to
like
it
much
by
the
way
but
i
do
i
assure
you
i
love
to
drive
through
the
streets
and
see
how
the
canaille
scowl
at
me
from
every
corner
it
makes
me
feel
i
am
a
power
in
russia
one
man
against
a
hundred
millions
besides
i
have
no
ambition
to
be
a
popular
hero
to
be
crowned
with
laurels
one
year
and
pelted
with
stones
the
next
i
prefer
dying
peaceably
in
my
own
bed
czare
and
after
death
prince
paul
his
heaven
is
a
despotism
i
shall
be
at
home
there
czare
do
you
never
think
of
the
people
and
their
rights
prince
paul
the
people
and
their
rights
bore
me
i
am
sick
of
both
in
these
modern
days
to
be
vulgar
illiterate
common
and
vicious
seems
to
give
a
man
a
marvellous
infinity
of
rights
that
his
honest
fathers
never
dreamed
of
believe
me
prince
in
good
democracy
every
man
should
be
an
aristocrat
but
these
people
in
russia
who
seek
to
thrust
us
out
are
no
better
than
the
animals
in
one
preserves
and
made
to
be
shot
at
most
of
them
czare
if
they
are
common
illiterate
vulgar
no
better
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
who
made
them
so
his
imperial
majesty
the
emperor
paul
looks
at
the
czarevitch
and
the
czar
surrounded
by
his
czare
forward
to
meet
sire
czar
and
do
come
too
near
me
boy
do
come
too
near
me
i
say
there
is
always
something
about
an
heir
to
a
crown
unwholesome
to
his
father
who
is
that
man
over
there
i
do
know
him
what
is
he
doing
is
he
a
conspirator

they
are
good
people
in
the
province
of
archangel
honest
loyal
people
they
love
me
very
much
simple
loyal
people
give
them
a
new
saint
it
costs
nothing
well
alexis
to
the
how
many
traitors
were
hung
this
morning
czare
there
were
three
men
strangled
sire
czar
there
should
have
been
three
thousand
i
would
to
god
that
this
people
had
but
one
neck
that
i
might
strangle
them
with
one
noose
did
they
tell
anything
whom
did
they
implicate
what
did
they
confess
czare
nothing
sire
czar
they
should
have
been
tortured
then
why
were
they
tortured
must
i
always
be
fighting
in
the
dark
am
i
never
to
know
from
what
root
these
traitors
spring
czare
what
root
should
there
be
of
discontent
among
the
people
but
tyranny
and
injustice
amongst
their
rulers
czar
what
did
you
say
boy
tyranny
tyranny
am
i
a
tyrant
i
not
i
love
the
people
i
their
father
i
called
so
in
every
official
proclamation
have
a
care
boy

a
care
you
do
seem
to
be
cured
yet
of
your
foolish
tongue
over
to
prince
paul
and
puts
his
hand
on
his
prince
paul
tell
me
were
there
many
people
there
this
morning
to
see
the
nihilists
hung
prince
paul
hanging
is
of
course
a
good
deal
less
of
a
novelty
in
russia
now
sire
than
it
was
three
or
four
years
ago
and
you
know
how
easily
the
people
get
tired
even
of
their
best
amusements
but
the
square
and
the
tops
of
the
houses
were
really
quite
crowded
were
they
not
prince
the
czarevitch
who
takes
no
czar
that
right
all
loyal
citizens
should
be
there
it
shows
them
what
to
look
forward
to
did
you
arrest
any
one
in
the
crowd
prince
paul
yes
sire
a
woman
for
cursing
your
name
czarevitch
starts
she
was
the
mother
of
the
two
criminals
czar
at
she
should
have
blessed
me
for
having
rid
her
of
her
children
send
her
to
prison
czare
the
prisons
of
russia
are
too
full
already
sire
there
is
no
room
in
them
for
any
more
victims
czar
they
do
die
fast
enough
then
you
should
put
more
of
them
into
one
cell
at
once
you
do
keep
them
long
enough
in
the
mines
if
you
do
they
sure
to
die
but
you
all
too
merciful
i
too
merciful
myself
send
her
to
siberia
she
is
sure
to
die
on
the
way
an
who
that

a
letter
for
his
imperial
majesty
czar
prince
i
wo
open
it
there
may
be
something
in
it
prince
paul
it
would
be
a
very
disappointing
letter
sire
if
there
was
letter
himself
and
reads
prince
petro
count
it
must
be
some
sad
news
i
know
that
smile
too
well

paul
from
the
chief
of
the
police
at
archangel
sire
the

it
a
nest

nihilists
and
conspirators
take
away
their
saints
they
do
deserve
them
prince
paul
your
highness
would
punish
them
more
severely
by
giving
them
an
extra
one
three
governors
shot
in
two
months
to
sire
permit
me
to
recommend
your
loyal
subject

governor
of

am
unfit
for

prince
paul
marquis
you
are
too
modest
believe
me
there
is
no
man
in
russia
i
would
sooner
see

of
archangel
than
yourself
to
czar
quite
right
prince

you
are
always
right
see
that
the
marquis
letters
are
made
out
at
once
prince

really
miss

paul
i
shall
see
that
madame
la
marquise
is
not
too
lonely
while
you
are
away
so
you
need
not
be
alarmed

her
count

should
be
more
alarmed
for
myself

the

for
her
but
for
some
reason
or
other

have
warned
her

taken
i

hew
her
limb
from

shall
stretch
her

were
peace
when

with
them
to

more
calm
and
i
have
ridden
into

crimson
heart
of
war
and
borne
back
an
eagle
which
those
wild
islanders
had
taken
from

quite
right

too
many
people

too
much
money
in

prince
paul
your

no
need
for

a
very
ingenuous
young
man
he
pretends
to
be
devoted
to
the
people
and
lives
in
a
palace
preaches
socialism
and
draws
a
salary
that
would
support
a
province
he
find
out
one
day
that
the
best
cure
for
republicanism
is
the
imperial
crown
and
will
cut
up
the
bonnet
rogue
of
democracy
to
make
decorations
for
his
prime
minister
czar
you
are
right
if
he
really
loved
the
people
he
could
not
be
my
son
prince
paul
if
he
lived
with
the
people
for
a
fortnight

think
sire
you
will
approve
of
this
love

prince
paul
mon

and
destroyed

he
said
the

nothing

he
actually
disapproved
of

was
not
enough
brawling

we
must
give

in
but
messieurs
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
he
threatens
a
complete
reform
in
the
public
service
on
the
ground
that
the

are
too
heavily
taxed

what
is
the

yes
but
what
are
we
to
do
baron

what
have
we
always
done
in

when
a
czar
suggests
reforms
nothing
you
forget
we
are
diplomatists
men
of
thought
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
action
reforms
in
russia
are
very
tragic
but
they
always
end
in
a
farce
count
i
wish
prince
paul
were
here
by
the
bye
i
think
this
boy
is
rather
ungrateful
to
him
if
that
clever
old
prince
had
not
proclaimed
him
emperor
at
once
without
giving
him
time
to
think
about
it
he
would
have
given
up
his
crown
i
believe
to
the
first
cobbler
he
met
in
the
street
prince
petro
but
do
you
think
baron
that
prince
paul
is
really
going
baron
raff
he
is
exiled
prince
petro
yes
but
is
he
going
baron
raff
i
am
sure
of
it
at
least
he
told
me
he
had
sent
two
telegrams
already
to
paris
about
his
dinner
count
ah
that
settles
the
matter
czar
prince
paul
better
send
a
third
telegram
and
order
six
extra
places

the

the

would

you
who
wreck
mighty

on

our

hath
no

you
can
make
no

now
it
is
too
late
for
that
the
grave
can
not
give
back
your
dead

the

your

but
i
shall
be
more
merciful
to

i
give

your

would
lay
on

is
a
man
of
you
found
in
moscow
by
night
your
heads
will
be
off
your
shoulders
baron
raff
you
remind
us
wonderfully
sire
of
your
imperial
father
czar
i
banish
you
all
from
russia
your
estates
are
confiscated
to
the
people
you
may
carry
your
titles
with
you
reforms
in
russia
baron
always
end
in
a
farce
you
will
have
a
good
opportunity
prince
petrovitch
of
practising
that
excellent
virtue
that
excellent
virtue
so
baron
you
think
a
parliament
in
russia
would
be
merely
a
place
for
brawling
well
i
will
see
that
the
reports
of
each
session
are
sent
to
you
regularly
baron
raff
sire
you
are
adding
another
horror
to
exile
czar
but
you
will
have
such
time
for
literature
now
you
forget
you
are
diplomatists
men
of
thought
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
action
prince
petro
sire

did
but
jest
czar
then
i
banish
you

your
bad
jokes

your
lives

will
catch
the
first
train
for
paris
russia
is
well
rid
of
such
men
as
these
they
are
the
jackals
that
follow
in
the
lion
track
they
have
no
courage
themselves
except
to
pillage
and
rob
but
for
these
men
and
for
prince
paul
my
father
would
have
been
a
good
king
would
not
have
died
so
horribly
as
he
did
die
how
strange
it
is
the
most
real
parts
of
one
life
always
seem
to
be
a
dream
the
council
the
fearful
law
which
was
to
kill
the
people
the
arrest
the
cry
in
the
courtyard
the
my
father
bloody
hands
and
then
the
crown
one
can
live
for
years
sometimes
without
living
at
all
and
then
all
life
comes
crowding
into
a
single
hour
i
had
no
time
to
think
before
my
hideous
shriek
of
death
had
died
in
my
ears
i
found
this
crown
on
my
head
the
purple
robe
around
me
and
heard
myself
called
a
king
i
would
have
given
it
up
all
then
it
seemed
nothing
to
me
then
but
now
can
i
give
it
up
now
well
colonel
well
colonel
of
the
colonel
what
password
does
your
imperial
majesty
desire
should
be
given
czar
password
colonel
for
the
cordon
of
guards
sire
on
night
duty
around
the
palace
czar
you
can
dismiss
them
i
have
no
need
of
them
to
the
crown
lying
on
the
what
subtle
potency
lies
hidden
in
this
gaudy
bauble
the
crown
that
makes
one
feel
like
a
god
when
one
wears
it
to
hold
in
one
hand
this
little
fiery
coloured
world
to
reach
out
one
arm
to
earth
uttermost
limit
to
girdle
the
seas
with
one
hosts
this
is
to
wear
a
crown
to
wear
a
crown
the
meanest
serf
in
russia
who
is
loved
is
better
crowned
than
i
how
love
outweighs
the
balance
how
poor
appears
the
widest
empire
of
this
golden
world
when
matched
with
love
pent
up
in
this
palace
with
spies
dogging
every
step
i
have
heard
nothing
of
her
i
have
not
seen
her
once
since

fearful
hour

this
wide
waste
russia

i
see
her
for
a
moment
tell
her
now
the
secret
of
my
life
i
have
never
dared
utter
before

her
why
i
wear
this
crown

i
have
sworn
eternal
war
against
all
crowned
men

full
of
music
it

some
nightingale
who
wearying
of
the
south
has
come
to
sing
in
this
bleak
north
to
lovers
such
as
we
it
is
the
nightingale

thine

had
i
heard
that
nightingale
and
seen
the
morning
sun
itself
steal
from
its
sombre
east
before
its
time
for
jealousy
that
thou
art
twice
as
fair
vera
yet
would
that
thou
hadst
heard
the
nightingale
methinks
that
bird
will
never
sing
again
czar
it
is
no
nightingale
is
love
himself
singing
for
very
ecstasy
of
joy
that
