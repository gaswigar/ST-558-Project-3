chapter
i
the
new
city
when
frank
algernon
cowperwood
emerged
from
the
eastern
district
penitentiary
in
philadelphia
he
realized
that
the
old
life
he
had
lived
in
that
city
since
boyhood
was
ended
his
youth
was
gone
and
with
it
had
been
lost
the
great
business
prospects
of
his
earlier
manhood
he
must
begin
again
it
would
be
useless
to
repeat
how
a
second
panic
following
upon
a
tremendous
failure
that
of
jay
cooke
had
placed
a
second
fortune
in
his
hands
this
restored
wealth
softened
him
in
some
degree
fate
seemed
to
have
his
personal
welfare
in
charge
he
was
sick
of
the
anyhow
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
now
decided
that
he
would
leave
it
once
and
for
all
he
would
get
in
something
else
land
deals
some
of
the
boundless
opportunities
of
the
far
west
philadelphia
was
no
longer
pleasing
to
him
though
now
free
and
rich
he
was
still
a
scandal
to
the
pretenders
and
the
financial
and
social
world
was
not
prepared
to
accept
him
he
must
go
his
way
alone
unaided
or
only
secretly
so
while
his
quondam
friends
watched
his
career
from
afar
so
thinking
of
this
he
took
the
train
one
day
his
charming
mistress
now
only
coming
to
the
station
to
see
him
off
he
looked
at
her
quite
tenderly
for
she
was
the
quintessence
of
a
certain
type
of
feminine
beauty
dearie
he
smiled
as
the
signaled
the
approaching
departure
you
and
i
will
get
out
of
this
shortly
do
grieve
i
be
back
in
two
or
three
weeks
or
i
send
for
you
i
take
you
now
only
i
do
know
how
that
country
is
out
there
we
fix
on
some
place
and
then
you
watch
me
settle
this
fortune
question
we
not
live
under
a
cloud
always
i
get
a
divorce
and
we
marry
and
things
will
come
right
with
a
bang
money
will
do
that
he
looked
at
her
with
his
large
cool
penetrating
eyes
and
she
clasped
his
cheeks
between
her
hands
oh
frank
she
exclaimed
i
miss
you
so
you
all
i
have
in
two
weeks
he
smiled
as
the
train
began
to
move
i
wire
or
be
back
be
good
sweet
she
followed
him
with
adoring
eyes
a
fool
of
love
a
spoiled
child
a
family
pet
amorous
eager
affectionate
the
type
so
strong
a
man
would
naturally
like
she
tossed
her
pretty
red
gold
head
and
waved
him
a
kiss
then
she
walked
away
with
rich
sinuous
healthy
strides
the
type
that
men
turn
to
look
after
that
her
that
that
butler
girl
observed
one
railroad
clerk
to
another
gee
a
man
would
want
anything
better
than
that
would
he
it
was
the
spontaneous
tribute
that
passion
and
envy
invariably
pay
to
health
and
beauty
on
that
pivot
swings
the
world
never
in
all
his
life
until
this
trip
had
cowperwood
been
farther
west
than
pittsburg
his
amazing
commercial
adventures
brilliant
as
they
were
had
been
almost
exclusively
confined
to
the
dull
staid
world
of
philadelphia
with
its
sweet
refinement
in
sections
its
pretensions
to
american
social
supremacy
its
cool
arrogation
of
traditional
leadership
in
commercial
life
its
history
conservative
wealth
unctuous
respectability
and
all
the
tastes
and
avocations
which
these
imply
he
had
as
he
recalled
almost
mastered
that
pretty
world
and
made
its
sacred
precincts
his
own
when
the
crash
came
practically
he
had
been
admitted
now
he
was
an
ishmael
an
albeit
a
millionaire
but
wait
the
race
is
to
the
swift
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
yes
and
the
battle
is
to
the
strong
he
would
test
whether
the
world
would
trample
him
under
foot
or
no
chicago
when
it
finally
dawned
on
him
came
with
a
rush
on
the
second
morning
he
had
spent
two
nights
in
the
gaudy
pullman
then
provided
a
car
intended
to
make
up
for
some
of
the
inconveniences
of
its
arrangements
by
an
of
plush
and
tortured
glass
when
the
first
lone
outposts
of
the
prairie
metropolis
began
to
appear
the
along
the
over
which
he
was
speeding
became
more
and
more
numerous
the
more
and
more
hung
with
arms
and
strung
with
wires
in
the
far
distance
cityward
was
here
and
there
a
lone
cottage
the
home
of
some
adventurous
soul
who
had
planted
his
bare
hut
thus
far
out
in
order
to
reap
the
small
but
certain
advantage
which
the
growth
of
the
city
would
bring
the
land
was
flat
as
flat
as
a
table
with
a
waning
growth
of
brown
grass
left
over
from
the
previous
year
and
stirring
faintly
in
the
morning
breeze
underneath
were
signs
of
the
new
green
the
new
flag
of
its
disposition
for
some
reason
a
crystalline
atmosphere
enfolded
the
distant
hazy
outlines
of
the
city
holding
the
latter
like
a
fly
in
amber
and
giving
it
an
artistic
subtlety
which
touched
him
already
a
devotee
of
art
ambitious
for
connoisseurship
who
had
had
his
joy
training
and
sorrow
out
of
the
collection
he
had
made
and
lost
in
philadelphia
he
appreciated
almost
every
suggestion
of
a
delightful
picture
in
nature
the
tracks
side
by
side
were
becoming
more
and
more
numerous
were
assembled
here
by
thousands
from
all
parts
of
the
country
yellow
red
blue
green
white
chicago
he
recalled
already
had
thirty
railroads
terminating
here
as
though
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
the
little
low
one
and
two
story
houses
quite
new
as
to
wood
were
frequently
unpainted
and
already
smoky
in
places
grimy
at
where
ambling
and
wagons
and
buggies
waited
he
noted
how
flat
the
streets
were
how
unpaved
how
sidewalks
went
up
and
down
rhythmically
here
a
flight
of
steps
a
veritable
platform
before
a
house
there
a
long
stretch
of
boards
laid
flat
on
the
mud
of
the
prairie
itself
what
a
city
presently
a
branch
of
the
filthy
arrogant
little
chicago
river
came
into
view
with
its
mass
of
sputtering
tugs
its
black
oily
water
its
tall
red
brown
and
green
its
immense
black
and
here
was
life
he
saw
it
at
a
flash
here
was
a
seething
city
in
the
making
there
was
something
dynamic
in
the
very
air
which
appealed
to
his
fancy
how
different
for
some
reason
from
philadelphia
that
was
a
stirring
city
too
he
had
thought
it
wonderful
at
one
time
quite
a
world
but
this
thing
while
obviously
infinitely
worse
was
better
it
was
more
youthful
more
hopeful
in
a
flare
of
morning
sunlight
pouring
between
two
and
because
the
train
had
stopped
to
let
a
bridge
swing
and
half
a
dozen
great
grain
and
lumber
boats
go
by
a
in
either
direction
he
saw
a
group
of
irish
stevedores
idling
on
the
bank
of
a
whose
wall
skirted
the
water
healthy
men
they
were
in
blue
or
red
stout
straps
about
their
waists
short
pipes
in
their
mouths
fine
hardy
specimens
of
humanity
why
were
they
so
appealing
he
asked
himself
this
raw
dirty
town
seemed
naturally
to
compose
itself
into
stirring
artistic
pictures
why
it
fairly
sang
the
world
was
young
here
life
was
doing
something
new
perhaps
he
had
better
not
go
on
to
the
northwest
at
all
he
would
decide
that
question
later
in
the
mean
time
he
had
letters
of
introduction
to
distinguished
chicagoans
and
these
he
would
present
he
wanted
to
talk
to
some
bankers
and
grain
and
commission
men
the
of
chicago
interested
him
for
the
intricacies
of
that
business
he
knew
backward
and
forward
and
some
great
grain
transactions
had
been
made
here
the
train
finally
rolled
past
the
shabby
backs
of
houses
into
a
long
shabbily
covered
series
of
platforms
sheds
having
only
roofs
and
amidst
a
clatter
of
trucks
hauling
trunks
and
engines
belching
steam
and
passengers
hurrying
to
and
fro
he
made
his
way
out
into
canal
street
and
hailed
a
waiting
cab
one
of
a
long
line
of
vehicles
that
bespoke
a
metropolitan
spirit
he
had
fixed
on
the
grand
pacific
as
the
most
important
hotel
the
one
with
the
most
social
significance
and
thither
he
asked
to
be
driven
on
the
way
he
studied
these
streets
as
in
the
matter
of
art
he
would
have
studied
a
picture
the
little
yellow
blue
green
white
and
brown
which
he
saw
trundling
here
and
there
the
tired
bony
horses
jingling
bells
at
their
throats
touched
him
they
were
flimsy
affairs
these
cars
merely
highly
varnished
with
bits
of
polished
brass
and
glass
stuck
about
them
but
he
realized
what
fortunes
they
portended
if
the
city
grew
he
knew
were
his
natural
vocation
even
more
than
even
more
than
banking
even
more
than
he
loved
the
thought
of
and
the
vast
manipulative
life
it
suggested
chapter
ii
a
reconnoiter
the
city
of
chicago
with
whose
development
the
personality
of
frank
algernon
cowperwood
was
soon
to
be
definitely
linked
to
whom
may
the
laurels
as
laureate
of
this
florence
of
the
west
yet
fall
this
singing
flame
of
a
city
this
all
america
this
poet
in
chaps
and
buckskin
this
rude
raw
titan
this
burns
of
a
city
by
its
shimmering
lake
it
lay
a
king
of
shreds
and
patches
a
maundering
yokel
with
an
epic
in
its
mouth
a
tramp
a
hobo
among
cities
with
the
grip
of
caesar
in
its
mind
the
dramatic
force
of
euripides
in
its
soul
a
very
bard
of
a
city
this
singing
of
high
deeds
and
high
hopes
its
heavy
brogans
buried
deep
in
the
mire
of
circumstance
take
athens
oh
greece
italy
do
you
keep
rome
this
was
the
babylon
the
troy
the
nineveh
of
a
younger
day
here
came
the
gaping
west
and
the
hopeful
east
to
see
here
hungry
men
raw
from
the
shops
and
fields
idyls
and
romances
in
their
minds
builded
them
an
empire
crying
glory
in
the
mud
from
new
york
vermont
new
hampshire
maine
had
come
a
strange
company
earnest
patient
determined
unschooled
in
even
the
primer
of
refinement
hungry
for
something
the
significance
of
which
when
they
had
it
they
could
not
even
guess
anxious
to
be
called
great
determined
so
to
be
without
ever
knowing
how
here
came
the
dreamy
gentleman
of
the
south
robbed
of
his
patrimony
the
hopeful
student
of
yale
and
harvard
and
princeton
the
enfranchised
miner
of
california
and
the
rockies
his
bags
of
gold
and
silver
in
his
hands
here
was
already
the
bewildered
foreigner
an
alien
speech
confounding
him
the
hun
the
pole
the
swede
the
german
the
russian
seeking
his
homely
colonies
fearing
his
neighbor
of
another
race
here
was
the
negro
the
prostitute
the
blackleg
the
gambler
the
romantic
adventurer
par
excellence
a
city
with
but
a
handful
of
the
a
city
packed
to
the
doors
with
all
the
riffraff
of
a
thousand
towns
flaring
were
the
lights
of
the
bagnio
tinkling
the
banjos
zithers
mandolins
of
the
all
the
dreams
and
the
brutality
of
the
day
seemed
gathered
to
rejoice
and
rejoice
they
did
in
this
wonder
of
a
metropolitan
life
in
the
west
the
first
prominent
chicagoan
whom
cowperwood
sought
out
was
the
president
of
the
lake
city
national
bank
the
largest
financial
organization
in
the
city
with
deposits
of
over
fourteen
million
dollars
it
was
located
in
dearborn
street
at
munroe
but
a
block
or
two
from
his
hotel
find
out
who
that
man
is
ordered
judah
addison
the
president
of
the
bank
on
seeing
him
enter
the
president
private
addison
office
was
so
arranged
with
glass
windows
that
he
could
by
craning
his
neck
see
all
who
entered
his
before
they
saw
him
and
he
had
been
struck
by
cowperwood
face
and
force
long
familiarity
with
the
banking
world
and
with
great
affairs
generally
had
given
a
rich
finish
to
the
ease
and
force
which
the
latter
naturally
possessed
he
looked
strangely
replete
for
a
man
of
suave
steady
incisive
with
eyes
as
fine
as
those
of
a
newfoundland
or
a
collie
and
as
innocent
and
winsome
they
were
wonderful
eyes
soft
and
at
times
glowing
with
a
rich
human
understanding
which
on
the
instant
could
harden
and
flash
lightning
deceptive
eyes
unreadable
but
alluring
alike
to
men
and
to
women
in
all
walks
and
conditions
of
life
the
secretary
addressed
came
back
with
cowperwood
letter
of
introduction
and
immediately
cowperwood
followed
addison
instinctively
arose
a
thing
he
did
not
always
do
pleased
to
meet
you
cowperwood
he
said
politely
i
saw
you
come
in
just
now
you
see
how
i
keep
my
windows
here
so
as
to
spy
out
the
country
sit
down
you
would
like
an
apple
would
you
he
opened
a
drawer
producing
several
polished
red
winesaps
one
of
which
he
held
out
i
always
eat
one
about
this
time
in
the
morning
thank
you
no
replied
cowperwood
pleasantly
estimating
as
he
did
so
his
host
temperament
and
mental
caliber
i
never
eat
between
meals
but
i
appreciate
your
kindness
i
am
just
passing
through
chicago
and
i
thought
i
would
present
this
letter
now
rather
than
later
i
thought
you
might
tell
me
a
little
about
the
city
from
an
investment
point
of
view
as
cowperwood
talked
addison
a
short
heavy
rubicund
man
with
sideburns
extending
to
his
and
hard
bright
twinkling
gray
eyes
a
proud
happy
man
munched
his
apple
and
contemplated
cowperwood
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
life
he
frequently
liked
or
disliked
people
on
sight
and
he
prided
himself
on
his
judgment
of
men
almost
foolishly
for
one
so
conservative
he
was
taken
with
cowperwood
a
man
immensely
his
superior
not
because
of
the
drexel
letter
which
spoke
of
the
latter
undoubted
financial
genius
and
the
advantage
it
would
be
to
chicago
to
have
him
settle
there
but
because
of
the
swimming
wonder
of
his
eyes
cowperwood
personality
while
maintaining
an
unbroken
outward
reserve
breathed
a
tremendous
humanness
which
touched
his
both
men
were
in
their
way
walking
enigmas
the
philadelphian
far
the
subtler
of
the
two
addison
was
ostensibly
a
a
model
citizen
he
represented
a
point
of
view
to
which
cowperwood
would
never
have
stooped
both
men
were
ruthless
after
their
fashion
avid
of
a
physical
life
but
addison
was
the
weaker
in
that
he
was
still
afraid
very
much
afraid
of
what
life
might
do
to
him
the
man
before
him
had
no
sense
of
fear
addison
contributed
judiciously
to
charity
subscribed
outwardly
to
a
dull
social
routine
pretended
to
love
his
wife
of
whom
he
was
weary
and
took
his
human
pleasure
secretly
the
man
before
him
subscribed
to
nothing
refused
to
talk
save
to
intimates
whom
he
controlled
spiritually
and
did
as
he
pleased
why
i
tell
you
cowperwood
addison
replied
we
people
out
here
in
chicago
think
so
well
of
ourselves
that
sometimes
we
afraid
to
say
all
we
think
for
fear
of
appearing
a
little
extravagant
like
the
youngest
son
in
the
family
that
knows
he
can
lick
all
the
others
but
does
want
to
do
it
not
just
yet
we
not
as
handsome
as
we
might
be
did
you
ever
see
a
growing
boy
that
was
but
absolutely
sure
that
we
going
to
be
our
pants
and
shoes
and
coat
and
hat
get
too
small
for
us
every
six
months
and
so
we
do
look
very
fashionable
but
there
are
big
strong
hard
muscles
and
bones
underneath
cowperwood
as
you
discover
when
you
get
to
looking
around
then
you
wo
mind
the
clothes
so
much
addison
round
frank
eyes
narrowed
and
hardened
for
a
moment
a
kind
of
metallic
hardness
came
into
his
voice
cowperwood
could
see
that
he
was
honestly
enamoured
of
his
adopted
city
chicago
was
his
most
beloved
mistress
a
moment
later
the
flesh
about
his
eyes
crinkled
his
mouth
softened
and
he
smiled
i
be
glad
to
tell
you
anything
i
can
he
went
on
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
things
to
tell
cowperwood
beamed
back
on
him
encouragingly
he
inquired
after
the
condition
of
one
industry
and
another
one
trade
or
profession
and
another
this
was
somewhat
different
from
the
atmosphere
which
prevailed
in
philadelphia
more
breezy
and
generous
the
tendency
to
expatiate
and
make
much
of
local
advantages
was
western
he
liked
it
however
as
one
aspect
of
life
whether
he
chose
to
share
in
it
or
not
it
was
favorable
to
his
own
future
he
had
a
prison
record
to
live
down
a
wife
and
two
children
to
get
rid
of
in
the
legal
sense
at
least
he
had
no
desire
to
rid
himself
of
financial
obligation
toward
them
it
would
take
some
such
loose
enthusiastic
western
attitude
to
forgive
in
him
the
strength
and
freedom
with
which
he
ignored
and
refused
to
accept
for
himself
current
convention
i
satisfy
myself
was
his
private
law
but
so
to
do
he
must
assuage
and
control
the
prejudices
of
other
men
he
felt
that
this
banker
while
not
putty
in
his
hands
was
inclined
to
a
strong
and
useful
friendship
my
impressions
of
the
city
are
entirely
favorable
addison
he
said
after
a
time
though
he
inwardly
admitted
to
himself
that
this
was
not
entirely
true
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
could
bring
himself
ultimately
to
live
in
so
excavated
and
scaffolded
a
world
as
this
or
not
i
only
saw
a
portion
of
it
coming
in
on
the
train
i
like
the
snap
of
things
i
believe
chicago
has
a
future
you
came
over
the
fort
wayne
i
presume
replied
addison
loftily
you
saw
the
worst
section
you
must
let
me
show
you
some
of
the
best
parts
by
the
way
where
are
you
staying
at
the
grand
pacific
how
long
will
you
be
here
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
let
me
see
and
addison
drew
out
his
watch
i
suppose
you
would
mind
meeting
a
few
of
our
leading
men
and
we
have
a
little
over
at
the
union
league
club
where
we
drop
in
now
and
then
if
you
care
to
do
so
i
like
to
have
you
come
along
with
me
at
one
we
sure
to
find
a
few
of
them
some
of
our
lawyers
business
men
and
judges
that
will
be
fine
said
the
philadelphian
simply
you
more
than
generous
there
are
one
or
two
other
people
i
want
to
meet
in
between
and
he
arose
and
looked
at
his
own
watch
i
find
the
union
club
where
is
the
office
of
arneel
at
the
mention
of
the
great
who
was
one
of
the
heaviest
depositors
addison
stirred
slightly
with
approval
this
young
man
at
least
eight
years
his
junior
looked
to
him
like
a
future
grand
seigneur
of
finance
at
the
union
club
at
this
noontime
luncheon
after
talking
with
the
portly
conservative
aggressive
arneel
and
the
shrewd
director
of
the
cowperwood
met
a
varied
company
of
men
ranging
in
age
from
to
gathered
about
the
board
in
a
private
of
heavily
carved
black
walnut
with
pictures
of
elder
citizens
of
chicago
on
the
walls
and
an
attempt
at
artistry
in
stained
glass
in
the
windows
there
were
short
and
long
men
lean
and
stout
dark
and
blond
men
with
eyes
and
jaws
which
varied
from
those
of
the
tiger
lynx
and
bear
to
those
of
the
fox
the
tolerant
mastiff
and
the
surly
bulldog
there
were
no
weaklings
in
this
selected
company
arneel
and
addison
cowperwood
approved
of
highly
as
shrewd
concentrated
men
another
who
interested
him
was
anson
merrill
a
small
polite
recherche
soul
suggesting
mansions
and
footmen
and
remote
luxury
generally
who
was
pointed
out
by
addison
as
the
famous
prince
of
that
name
quite
the
leading
merchant
in
the
retail
and
wholesale
sense
in
chicago
still
another
was
a
rambaud
pioneer
railroad
man
to
whom
addison
smiling
jocosely
observed
cowperwood
is
on
from
philadelphia
rambaud
trying
to
find
out
whether
he
wants
to
lose
any
money
out
here
ca
you
sell
him
some
of
that
bad
land
you
have
up
in
the
northwest
rambaud
a
spare
pale
man
of
much
force
and
exactness
dressed
as
cowperwood
observed
in
much
better
taste
than
some
of
the
others
looked
at
cowperwood
shrewdly
but
in
a
gentlemanly
retiring
way
with
a
gracious
enigmatic
smile
he
caught
a
glance
in
return
which
he
could
not
possibly
forget
the
eyes
of
cowperwood
said
more
than
any
words
ever
could
instead
of
jesting
faintly
rambaud
decided
to
explain
some
things
about
the
northwest
perhaps
this
philadelphian
might
be
interested
to
a
man
who
has
gone
through
a
great
life
struggle
in
one
metropolis
and
tested
all
the
phases
of
human
duplicity
decency
sympathy
and
chicanery
in
the
controlling
group
of
men
that
one
invariably
finds
in
every
american
city
at
least
the
temperament
and
significance
of
another
group
in
another
city
is
not
so
much
and
yet
it
is
long
since
cowperwood
had
parted
company
with
the
idea
that
humanity
at
any
angle
or
under
any
circumstances
climatic
or
otherwise
is
in
any
way
different
to
him
the
most
noteworthy
characteristic
of
the
human
race
was
that
it
was
strangely
chemic
being
anything
or
nothing
as
the
hour
and
the
condition
afforded
in
his
leisure
moments
those
free
from
practical
calculation
which
were
not
many
he
often
speculated
as
to
what
life
really
was
if
he
had
not
been
a
great
financier
and
above
all
a
marvelous
organizer
he
might
have
become
a
highly
individualistic
philosopher
a
calling
which
if
he
had
thought
anything
about
it
at
all
at
this
time
would
have
seemed
rather
trivial
his
business
as
he
saw
it
was
with
the
material
facts
of
life
or
rather
with
those
third
and
fourth
degree
theorems
and
syllogisms
which
control
material
things
and
so
represent
wealth
he
was
here
to
deal
with
the
great
general
needs
of
the
middle
west
to
seize
upon
if
he
might
certain
of
wealth
and
power
and
rise
to
recognized
authority
in
his
morning
talks
he
had
learned
of
the
extent
and
character
of
the
enterprises
of
the
great
railroad
and
ship
interests
of
the
tremendous
rising
importance
of
real
estate
grain
speculation
the
hotel
business
the
hardware
business
he
had
learned
of
universal
manufacturing
companies
one
that
made
cars
another
elevators
another
binders
another
windmills
another
engines
apparently
any
new
industry
seemed
to
do
well
in
chicago
in
his
talk
with
the
one
director
of
the
board
of
trade
to
whom
he
had
a
letter
he
had
learned
that
few
if
any
local
stocks
were
dealt
in
on
wheat
corn
and
grains
of
all
kinds
were
principally
speculated
in
the
big
stocks
of
the
east
were
gambled
in
by
way
of
leased
wires
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
not
otherwise
as
he
looked
at
these
men
all
pleasantly
civil
all
general
in
their
remarks
each
safely
keeping
his
vast
plans
under
his
vest
cowperwood
wondered
how
he
would
fare
in
this
community
there
were
such
difficult
things
ahead
of
him
to
do
no
one
of
these
men
all
of
whom
were
in
their
way
agreeable
knew
that
he
had
only
recently
been
in
the
penitentiary
how
much
difference
would
that
make
in
their
attitude
no
one
of
them
knew
that
although
he
was
married
and
had
two
children
he
was
planning
to
divorce
his
wife
and
marry
the
girl
who
had
appropriated
to
herself
the
role
which
his
wife
had
once
played
are
you
seriously
contemplating
looking
into
the
northwest
asked
rambaud
interestedly
toward
the
close
of
the
luncheon
that
is
my
present
plan
after
i
finish
here
i
thought
i
take
a
short
run
up
there
let
me
put
you
in
touch
with
an
interesting
party
that
is
going
as
far
as
fargo
and
duluth
there
is
a
private
car
leaving
thursday
most
of
them
citizens
of
chicago
but
some
easterners
i
would
be
glad
to
have
you
join
us
i
am
going
as
far
as
minneapolis
cowperwood
thanked
him
and
accepted
a
long
conversation
followed
about
the
northwest
its
timber
wheat
land
sales
cattle
and
possible
manufacturing
plants
what
fargo
minneapolis
and
duluth
were
to
be
civically
and
financially
were
the
chief
topics
of
conversation
naturally
rambaud
having
under
his
direction
vast
railroad
lines
which
penetrated
this
region
was
confident
of
the
future
of
it
cowperwood
gathered
it
all
almost
by
instinct
gas
land
speculations
banks
wherever
located
were
his
chief
thoughts
finally
he
left
the
club
to
keep
his
other
appointments
but
something
of
his
personality
remained
behind
him
addison
and
rambaud
among
others
were
sincerely
convinced
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
men
they
had
met
in
years
and
he
scarcely
had
said
anything
at
all
just
listened
chapter
iii
a
chicago
evening
after
his
first
visit
to
the
bank
over
which
addison
presided
and
an
informal
dinner
at
the
latter
home
cowperwood
had
decided
that
he
did
not
care
to
sail
under
any
false
colors
so
far
as
addison
was
concerned
he
was
too
influential
and
well
connected
besides
cowperwood
liked
him
too
much
seeing
that
the
man
leaning
toward
him
was
strong
in
reality
a
fascination
he
made
an
early
morning
call
a
day
or
two
after
he
had
returned
from
fargo
whither
he
had
gone
at
rambaud
suggestion
on
his
way
back
to
philadelphia
determined
to
volunteer
a
smooth
presentation
of
his
earlier
misfortunes
and
trust
to
addison
interest
to
make
him
view
the
matter
in
a
kindly
light
he
told
him
the
whole
story
of
how
he
had
been
convicted
of
technical
embezzlement
in
philadelphia
and
had
served
out
his
term
in
the
eastern
penitentiary
he
also
mentioned
his
divorce
and
his
intention
of
marrying
again
addison
who
was
the
weaker
man
of
the
two
and
yet
forceful
in
his
own
way
admired
this
courageous
stand
on
cowperwood
part
it
was
a
braver
thing
than
he
himself
could
or
would
have
achieved
it
appealed
to
his
sense
of
the
dramatic
here
was
a
man
who
apparently
had
been
dragged
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
things
his
face
forced
in
the
mire
and
now
he
was
coming
up
again
strong
hopeful
urgent
the
banker
knew
many
highly
respected
men
in
chicago
whose
early
careers
as
he
was
well
aware
would
not
bear
too
close
an
inspection
but
nothing
was
thought
of
that
some
of
them
were
in
society
some
not
but
all
of
them
were
powerful
why
should
not
cowperwood
be
allowed
to
begin
all
over
he
looked
at
him
steadily
at
his
eyes
at
his
stocky
body
at
his
smooth
handsome
mustached
face
then
he
held
out
his
hand
cowperwood
he
said
finally
trying
to
shape
his
words
appropriately
i
need
say
that
i
am
pleased
with
this
interesting
confession
it
appeals
to
me
i
glad
you
have
made
it
to
me
you
need
say
any
more
at
any
time
i
decided
the
day
i
saw
you
walking
into
that
vestibule
that
you
were
an
exceptional
man
now
i
know
it
you
need
apologize
to
me
i
have
lived
in
this
world
fifty
years
and
more
without
having
my
cut
you
welcome
to
the
courtesies
of
this
bank
and
of
my
house
as
long
as
you
care
to
avail
yourself
of
them
we
cut
our
cloth
as
circumstances
dictate
in
the
future
i
like
to
see
you
come
to
chicago
solely
because
i
like
you
personally
if
you
decide
to
settle
here
i
sure
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
and
you
to
me
do
think
anything
more
about
it
i
ever
say
anything
one
way
or
another
you
have
your
own
battle
to
fight
and
i
wish
you
luck
you
get
all
the
aid
from
me
i
can
honestly
give
you
just
forget
that
you
told
me
and
when
you
get
your
matrimonial
affairs
straightened
out
bring
your
wife
out
to
see
us
with
these
things
completed
cowperwood
took
the
train
back
to
philadelphia
aileen
he
said
when
these
two
met
again
she
had
come
to
the
train
to
meet
him
i
think
the
west
is
the
answer
for
us
i
went
up
to
fargo
and
looked
around
up
there
but
i
do
believe
we
want
to
go
that
far
there
nothing
but
and
indians
out
in
that
country
how
you
like
to
live
in
a
board
shanty
aileen
he
asked
banteringly
with
nothing
but
fried
rattlesnakes
and
for
breakfast
do
you
think
you
could
stand
that
yes
she
replied
gaily
hugging
his
arm
for
they
had
entered
a
closed
carriage
i
could
stand
it
if
you
could
i
go
anywhere
with
you
frank
i
get
me
a
nice
indian
dress
with
leather
and
beads
all
over
it
and
a
feather
hat
like
they
wear
and
there
you
go
certainly
pretty
clothes
first
of
all
in
a
shack
that
the
way
you
would
love
me
long
if
i
did
put
pretty
clothes
first
she
replied
spiritedly
oh
i
so
glad
to
get
you
back
the
trouble
is
he
went
on
that
that
country
up
there
is
as
promising
as
chicago
i
think
we
destined
to
live
in
chicago
i
made
an
investment
in
fargo
and
we
have
to
go
up
there
from
time
to
time
but
we
eventually
locate
in
chicago
i
do
want
to
go
out
there
alone
again
it
is
pleasant
for
me
he
squeezed
her
hand
if
we
ca
arrange
this
thing
at
once
i
just
have
to
introduce
you
as
my
wife
for
the
present
you
have
heard
anything
more
from
mr
steger
she
put
in
she
was
thinking
of
steger
efforts
to
get
cowperwood
to
grant
him
a
divorce
not
a
word
is
it
too
bad
she
sighed
well
do
grieve
things
might
be
worse
he
was
thinking
of
his
days
in
the
penitentiary
and
so
was
she
after
commenting
on
the
character
of
chicago
he
decided
with
her
that
so
soon
as
conditions
permitted
they
would
remove
themselves
to
the
western
city
it
would
be
pointless
to
do
more
than
roughly
sketch
the
period
of
three
years
during
which
the
various
changes
which
saw
the
complete
elimination
of
cowperwood
from
philadelphia
and
his
introduction
into
chicago
took
place
for
a
time
there
were
merely
journeys
to
and
fro
at
first
more
especially
to
chicago
then
to
fargo
where
his
transported
secretary
walter
whelpley
was
managing
under
his
direction
the
construction
of
fargo
business
blocks
a
short
line
and
a
this
interesting
venture
bore
the
title
of
the
fargo
construction
and
transportation
company
of
which
frank
cowperwood
was
president
his
philadelphia
lawyer
harper
steger
was
for
the
time
being
general
master
of
contracts
for
another
short
period
he
might
have
been
found
living
at
the
tremont
in
chicago
avoiding
for
the
time
being
because
of
aileen
company
anything
more
than
a
nodding
contact
with
the
important
men
he
had
first
met
while
he
looked
quietly
into
the
matter
of
a
chicago
brokerage
arrangement
a
partnership
with
some
established
broker
who
without
too
much
personal
ambition
would
bring
him
a
knowledge
of
chicago
stock
exchange
affairs
personages
and
chicago
ventures
on
one
occasion
he
took
aileen
with
him
to
fargo
where
with
a
haughty
bored
insouciance
she
surveyed
the
state
of
the
growing
city
oh
frank
she
exclaimed
when
she
saw
the
plain
wooden
hotel
the
long
unpleasing
business
street
with
its
motley
collection
of
frame
and
brick
stores
the
gaping
stretches
of
houses
facing
in
most
directions
unpaved
streets
aileen
in
her
tailored
her
vigor
vanity
and
tendency
to
was
a
strange
contrast
to
the
rugged
and
indifference
to
personal
charm
which
characterized
most
of
the
men
and
women
of
this
new
metropolis
you
did
seriously
think
of
coming
out
here
to
live
did
you
she
was
wondering
where
her
chance
for
social
exchange
would
come
in
her
opportunity
to
shine
suppose
her
frank
were
to
be
very
rich
suppose
he
did
make
very
much
money
much
more
than
he
had
ever
had
even
in
the
past
what
good
would
it
do
her
here
in
philadelphia
before
his
failure
before
she
had
been
suspected
of
the
secret
liaison
with
him
he
had
been
beginning
at
least
to
entertain
in
a
very
pretentious
way
if
she
had
been
his
wife
then
she
might
have
stepped
smartly
into
philadelphia
society
out
here
good
gracious
she
turned
up
her
pretty
nose
in
disgust
what
an
awful
place
was
her
one
comment
at
this
most
stirring
of
western
boom
towns
when
it
came
to
chicago
however
and
its
swirling
increasing
life
aileen
was
much
interested
between
attending
to
many
financial
matters
cowperwood
saw
to
it
that
she
was
not
left
alone
he
asked
her
to
shop
in
the
local
stores
and
tell
him
about
them
and
this
she
did
driving
around
in
an
open
carriage
attractively
arrayed
a
great
brown
hat
emphasizing
her
complexion
and
hair
on
different
afternoons
of
their
stay
he
took
her
to
drive
over
the
principal
streets
when
aileen
was
permitted
for
the
first
time
to
see
the
spacious
beauty
and
richness
of
prairie
avenue
the
north
shore
drive
michigan
avenue
and
the
new
mansions
on
ashland
boulevard
set
in
their
grassy
spaces
the
spirit
aspirations
hope
tang
of
the
future
chicago
began
to
work
in
her
blood
as
it
had
in
cowperwood
all
of
these
rich
homes
were
so
very
new
the
great
people
of
chicago
were
all
newly
rich
like
themselves
she
forgot
that
as
yet
she
was
not
cowperwood
wife
she
felt
herself
truly
to
be
so
the
streets
set
in
most
instances
with
a
pleasing
flagging
lined
with
young
newly
planted
trees
the
lawns
sown
to
smooth
green
grass
the
windows
of
the
houses
trimmed
with
bright
awnings
and
hung
with
intricate
lace
blowing
in
a
june
breeze
the
roadways
a
gray
gritty
macadam
all
these
things
touched
her
fancy
on
one
drive
they
skirted
the
lake
on
the
north
shore
and
aileen
contemplating
the
chalky
waters
the
distant
sails
the
gulls
and
then
the
new
bright
homes
reflected
that
in
all
certitude
she
would
some
day
be
the
mistress
of
one
of
these
splendid
mansions
how
haughtily
she
would
carry
herself
how
she
would
dress
they
would
have
a
splendid
house
much
finer
no
doubt
than
frank
old
one
in
philadelphia
with
a
great
and
where
she
could
give
dances
and
dinners
and
where
frank
and
she
would
receive
as
the
peers
of
these
chicago
rich
people
do
you
suppose
we
will
ever
have
a
house
as
fine
as
one
of
these
frank
she
asked
him
longingly
i
tell
you
what
my
plan
is
he
said
if
you
like
this
michigan
avenue
section
we
buy
a
piece
of
property
out
here
now
and
hold
it
just
as
soon
as
i
make
the
right
connections
here
and
see
what
i
am
going
to
do
we
build
a
house
something
really
nice
do
worry
i
want
to
get
this
divorce
matter
settled
and
then
we
begin
meanwhile
if
we
have
to
come
here
we
better
live
rather
quietly
do
you
think
so
it
was
now
between
five
and
six
that
richest
portion
of
a
summer
day
it
had
been
very
warm
but
was
now
cooling
the
shade
of
the
western
shadowing
the
roadway
a
moted
air
filling
the
street
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
were
carriages
the
one
great
social
diversion
of
chicago
because
there
was
otherwise
so
little
opportunity
for
many
to
show
that
they
had
means
the
social
forces
were
not
as
yet
clear
or
harmonious
jingling
harnesses
of
nickel
silver
and
even
plated
gold
were
the
sign
manual
of
social
hope
if
not
of
achievement
here
sped
homeward
from
the
city
from
office
and
manufactory
along
this
one
exceptional
southern
highway
the
via
appia
of
the
south
side
all
the
urgent
aspirants
to
notable
fortunes
men
of
wealth
who
had
met
only
casually
in
trade
here
nodded
to
each
other
smart
daughters
sons
handsome
wives
came
in
traps
victorias
carriages
and
vehicles
of
the
latest
design
to
drive
home
their
fathers
or
brothers
relatives
or
friends
the
air
was
gay
with
a
social
hope
a
promise
of
youth
and
affection
and
that
fine
flush
of
material
life
that
recreates
itself
in
delight
lithe
handsome
animals
singly
and
in
jingling
pairs
paced
each
other
down
the
long
wide
street
its
fine
homes
agleam
with
a
rich
complaisant
materiality
oh
exclaimed
aileen
all
at
once
seeing
the
vigorous
forceful
men
the
handsome
matrons
and
young
women
and
boys
the
nodding
and
the
bowing
feeling
a
touch
of
the
romance
and
wonder
of
it
all
i
should
like
to
live
in
chicago
i
believe
it
nicer
than
philadelphia
cowperwood
who
had
fallen
so
low
there
despite
his
immense
capacity
set
his
teeth
in
two
even
rows
his
handsome
mustache
seemed
at
this
moment
to
have
an
especially
defiant
curl
the
pair
he
was
driving
was
physically
perfect
lean
and
nervous
with
spoiled
petted
faces
he
could
not
endure
poor
he
drove
as
only
a
can
his
body
bolt
upright
his
own
energy
and
temperament
animating
his
animals
aileen
sat
beside
him
very
proud
consciously
erect
is
she
beautiful
some
of
the
women
observed
as
they
passed
going
north
what
a
stunning
young
woman
thought
or
said
the
men
did
you
see
her
asked
a
young
brother
of
his
sister
never
mind
aileen
commented
cowperwood
with
that
iron
determination
that
brooks
no
defeat
we
will
be
a
part
of
this
do
fret
you
will
have
everything
you
want
in
chicago
and
more
besides
there
was
tingling
over
his
fingers
into
the
reins
into
the
horses
a
mysterious
vibrating
current
that
was
his
chemical
product
the
of
his
spirit
battery
that
made
his
hired
horses
prance
like
children
they
chafed
and
tossed
their
heads
and
snorted
aileen
was
fairly
bursting
with
hope
and
vanity
and
longing
oh
to
be
frank
algernon
cowperwood
here
in
chicago
to
have
a
splendid
mansion
to
have
her
cards
of
invitation
practically
commands
which
might
not
be
ignored
oh
dear
she
sighed
to
herself
mentally
if
only
it
were
all
true
now
it
is
thus
that
life
at
its
topmost
toss
irks
and
pains
beyond
is
ever
the
unattainable
the
lure
of
the
infinite
with
its
infinite

oh

oh

oh

oh

chapter
iv
peter
laughlin
co
the
partnership
which
cowperwood
eventually
made
with
an
board
of
trade
operator
peter
laughlin
was
eminently
to
his
satisfaction
laughlin
was
a
tall
gaunt
speculator
who
had
spent
most
of
his
living
days
in
chicago
having
come
there
as
a
boy
from
western
missouri
he
was
a
typical
chicago
board
of
trade
operator
of
the
old
school
having
an
andrew
jacksonish
countenance
and
a
henry
clay
davy
crockett
long
john
wentworth
build
of
body
cowperwood
from
his
youth
up
had
had
a
curious
interest
in
quaint
characters
and
he
was
interesting
to
them
they
took
to
him
he
could
if
he
chose
to
take
the
trouble
fit
himself
in
with
the
odd
psychology
of
almost
any
individual
in
his
early
peregrinations
in
la
salle
street
he
inquired
after
clever
traders
on
and
then
gave
them
one
small
commission
after
another
in
order
to
get
acquainted
thus
he
stumbled
one
morning
on
old
peter
laughlin
wheat
and
corn
trader
who
had
an
office
in
la
salle
street
near
madison
and
who
did
a
modest
business
gambling
for
himself
and
others
in
grain
and
eastern
railway
shares
laughlin
was
a
shrewd
canny
american
originally
perhaps
of
scotch
extraction
who
had
all
the
traditional
american
blemishes
of
uncouthness
profanity
and
other
small
vices
cowperwood
could
tell
from
looking
at
him
that
he
must
have
a
fund
of
information
concerning
every
current
chicagoan
of
importance
and
this
fact
alone
was
certain
to
be
of
value
then
the
old
man
was
direct
and
wholly
unpretentious
qualities
which
cowperwood
deemed
invaluable
once
or
twice
in
the
last
three
years
laughlin
had
lost
heavily
on
private
corners
that
he
had
attempted
to
engineer
and
the
general
feeling
was
that
he
was
now
becoming
cautious
or
in
other
words
afraid
just
the
man
cowperwood
thought
so
one
morning
he
called
upon
laughlin
intending
to
open
a
small
account
with
him
henry
he
heard
the
old
man
say
as
he
entered
laughlin
but
rather
dusty
office
to
a
young
preternaturally
clerk
a
fit
assistant
for
peter
laughlin
git
me
them
there
pittsburg
and
lake
erie
sheers
will
you
seeing
cowperwood
waiting
he
added
what
kin
i
do
for
ye
cowperwood
smiled
so
he
calls
them
does
he
he
thought
good
i
think
i
like
him
he
introduced
himself
as
coming
from
philadelphia
and
went
on
to
say
that
he
was
interested
in
various
chicago
ventures
inclined
to
invest
in
any
good
stock
which
would
rise
and
particularly
desirous
to
buy
into
some
corporation
public
utility
preferred
which
would
be
certain
to
grow
with
the
expansion
of
the
city
old
laughlin
who
was
now
all
of
sixty
years
of
age
owned
a
seat
on
the
board
and
was
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
looked
at
cowperwood
quizzically
well
now
if
you
come
along
here
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
you
might
got
in
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
lot
of
things
he
observed
there
was
these
here
gas
companies
now
that
them
otway
and
apperson
boys
got
in
on
and
then
all
these
here
why
i
the
feller
that
told
eddie
parkinson
what
a
fine
thing
he
could
make
out
of
it
if
he
would
go
and
organize
that
north
state
street
line
he
promised
me
a
bunch
of
sheers
if
he
ever
worked
it
out
but
he
never
give
to
me
i
did
expect
him
to
though
he
added
wisely
and
with
a
glint
i
too
old
a
trader
for
that
he
out
of
it
now
anyway
that
crowd
skinned
him
yep
if
you
been
here
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
you
might
got
in
on
that
no
use
about
that
though
any
more
them
sheers
is
sellin
fer
clost
onto
a
hundred
and
sixty
cowperwood
smiled
well
laughlin
he
observed
you
must
have
been
on
a
long
time
here
you
seem
to
know
a
good
deal
of
what
has
gone
on
in
the
past
yep
ever
since
replied
the
old
man
he
had
a
thick
growth
of
upstanding
hair
looking
not
unlike
a
rooster
comb
a
long
and
what
threatened
eventually
to
become
a
chin
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
high
and
hollow
cheeks
his
eyes
were
as
clear
and
sharp
as
those
of
a
lynx
to
tell
you
the
truth
laughlin
went
on
cowperwood
what
really
out
here
in
chicago
for
is
to
find
a
man
with
whom
i
can
go
into
partnership
in
the
brokerage
business
now
i
in
the
banking
and
brokerage
business
myself
in
the
east
i
have
a
firm
in
philadelphia
and
a
seat
on
both
the
new
york
and
philadelphia
exchanges
i
have
some
affairs
in
fargo
also
any
trade
agency
can
tell
you
about
me
you
have
a
board
of
trade
seat
here
and
no
doubt
you
do
some
new
york
and
philadelphia
exchange
business
the
new
firm
if
you
would
go
in
with
me
could
handle
it
all
direct
i
a
rather
strong
outside
man
myself
i
thinking
of
locating
permanently
in
chicago
what
would
you
say
now
to
going
into
business
with
me
do
you
think
we
could
get
along
in
the
same
office
space
cowperwood
had
a
way
when
he
wanted
to
be
pleasant
of
beating
the
fingers
of
his
two
hands
together
finger
for
finger
tip
for
tip
he
also
smiled
at
the
same
time
or
rather
beamed
his
eyes
glowing
with
a
warm
magnetic
seemingly
affectionate
light
as
it
happened
old
peter
laughlin
had
arrived
at
that
psychological
moment
when
he
was
wishing
that
some
such
opportunity
as
this
might
appear
and
be
available
he
was
a
lonely
man
never
having
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
trust
his
peculiar
temperament
in
the
hands
of
any
woman
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
never
understood
women
at
all
his
relations
being
confined
to
those
sad
immoralities
of
the
cheapest
character
which
only
money
grudgingly
given
at
that
could
buy
he
lived
in
three
small
rooms
in
west
harrison
street
near
throup
where
he
cooked
his
own
meals
at
times
his
one
companion
was
a
small
spaniel
simple
and
affectionate
a
she
dog
jennie
by
name
with
whom
he
slept
jennie
was
a
docile
loving
companion
waiting
for
him
patiently
by
day
in
his
office
until
he
was
ready
to
go
home
at
night
he
talked
to
this
spaniel
quite
as
he
would
to
a
human
being
even
more
intimately
perhaps
taking
the
dog
glances
and
general
movements
for
answer
in
the
morning
when
he
arose
which
was
often
as
early
as
half
past
four
or
even
four
he
was
a
brief
sleeper
he
would
begin
by
pulling
on
his
trousers
he
seldom
bathed
any
more
except
at
a
barber
shop
and
talking
to
jennie
git
up
now
jinnie
he
would
say
it
time
to
git
up
we
got
to
make
our
coffee
now
and
git
some
breakfast
i
can
see
yuh
there
pertendin
to
be
asleep
come
on
now
you
had
sleep
enough
you
been
sleepin
as
long
as
i
have
jennie
would
be
watching
him
out
of
the
corner
of
one
loving
eye
her
tail
on
the
bed
her
free
ear
going
up
and
down
when
he
was
fully
dressed
his
face
and
hands
washed
his
old
string
tie
pulled
around
into
a
loose
and
convenient
knot
his
hair
brushed
upward
jennie
would
get
up
and
jump
demonstratively
about
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
how
prompt
i
am
that
the
way
old
laughlin
would
comment
allers
last
yuh
never
git
up
first
do
yuh
jinnie
allers
let
yer
old
man
do
that
you
on
bitter
days
when
the
squeaked
and
one
ears
and
fingers
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
freezing
old
laughlin
arrayed
in
a
heavy
dusty
greatcoat
of
ancient
vintage
and
a
square
hat
would
carry
jennie
in
a
bag
along
with
some
of
his
beloved
sheers
which
he
was
meditating
on
only
then
could
he
take
jennie
in
the
cars
on
other
days
they
would
walk
for
he
liked
exercise
he
would
get
to
his
office
as
early
as
or
eight
though
business
did
not
usually
begin
until
after
nine
and
remain
until
or
five
reading
the
papers
or
calculating
during
the
hours
when
there
were
no
customers
then
he
would
take
jennie
and
go
for
a
walk
or
to
call
on
some
business
acquaintance
his
home
room
the
newspapers
the
floor
of
the
exchange
his
offices
and
the
streets
were
his
only
resources
he
cared
nothing
for
plays
books
pictures
music
and
for
women
only
in
his
mentally
impoverished
way
his
limitations
were
so
marked
that
to
a
lover
of
character
like
cowperwood
he
was
fascinating
but
cowperwood
only
used
character
he
never
idled
over
it
long
artistically
as
cowperwood
suspected
what
old
laughlin
did
not
know
about
chicago
financial
conditions
deals
opportunities
and
individuals
was
scarcely
worth
knowing
being
only
a
trader
by
instinct
neither
an
organizer
nor
an
executive
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
any
great
constructive
use
of
his
knowledge
his
gains
and
his
losses
he
took
with
reasonable
equanimity
exclaiming
over
and
over
when
he
lost
shucks
i
had
orter
have
done
that
and
snapping
his
fingers
when
he
won
heavily
or
was
winning
he
munched
tobacco
with
a
seraphic
smile
and
occasionally
in
the
midst
of
trading
would
exclaim
you
fellers
better
come
in
it
rain
some
more
he
was
not
easy
to
trap
in
any
small
gambling
game
and
only
lost
or
won
when
there
was
a
free
open
struggle
in
the
market
or
when
he
was
engineering
some
little
scheme
of
his
own
the
matter
of
this
partnership
was
not
arranged
at
once
although
it
did
not
take
long
old
peter
laughlin
wanted
to
think
it
over
although
he
had
immediately
developed
a
personal
fancy
for
cowperwood
in
a
way
he
was
the
latter
victim
and
servant
from
the
start
they
met
day
after
day
to
discuss
various
details
and
terms
finally
true
to
his
instincts
old
peter
demanded
a
full
half
interest
now
you
do
want
that
much
laughlin
cowperwood
suggested
quite
blandly
they
were
sitting
in
laughlin
private
office
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
and
laughlin
was
chewing
tobacco
with
the
sense
of
having
a
fine
interesting
problem
before
him
i
have
a
seat
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
he
went
on
and
that
worth
forty
thousand
dollars
my
seat
on
the
philadelphia
exchange
is
worth
more
than
yours
here
they
will
naturally
figure
as
the
principal
assets
of
the
firm
it
to
be
in
your
name
i
be
liberal
with
you
though
instead
of
a
third
which
would
be
fair
i
make
it
per
and
we
call
the
firm
peter
laughlin
co
i
like
you
and
i
think
you
can
be
of
a
lot
of
use
to
me
i
know
you
will
make
more
money
through
me
than
you
have
alone
i
could
go
in
with
a
lot
of
these
fellows
around
here
but
i
do
want
to
better
decide
right
now
and
let
get
to
work
old
laughlin
was
pleased
beyond
measure
that
young
cowperwood
should
want
to
go
in
with
him
he
had
become
aware
of
late
that
all
of
the
young
smug
newcomers
on
considered
him
an
old
fogy
here
was
a
strong
brave
young
easterner
twenty
years
his
junior
evidently
as
shrewd
as
himself
more
so
he
feared
who
actually
proposed
a
business
alliance
besides
cowperwood
in
his
young
healthy
aggressive
way
was
like
a
breath
of
spring
i
ai
keerin
so
much
about
the
name
rejoined
laughlin
you
can
fix
it
if
you
want
to
givin
you
per
cent
gives
you
charge
of
this
here
shebang
all
right
though
i
ai
i
guess
i
can
manage
allus
to
git
what
to
me
it
a
bargain
then
said
cowperwood
we
want
new
offices
laughlin
do
you
think
this
one
a
little
dark
fix
it
up
any
way
you
like
cowperwood
it
all
the
same
to
me
i
be
glad
to
see
how
yer
do
it
in
a
week
the
details
were
completed
and
two
weeks
later
the
sign
of
peter
laughlin
grain
and
commission
merchants
appeared
over
the
door
of
a
handsome
suite
of
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
corner
at
la
salle
and
madison
in
the
heart
of
the
chicago
financial
district
get
onto
old
laughlin
will
you
one
broker
observed
to
another
as
they
passed
the
new
pretentious
with
its
splendid
windows
and
observed
the
heavy
ornate
bronze
sign
placed
on
either
side
of
the
door
which
was
located
exactly
on
the
corner
what
struck
him
i
thought
he
was
almost
all
through
who
the
company
i
do
know
some
fellow
from
the
east
i
think
well
he
certainly
moving
up
look
at
the
plate
glass
will
you
it
was
thus
that
frank
algernon
cowperwood
chicago
financial
career
was
definitely
launched
chapter
v
concerning
a
wife
and
family
if
any
one
fancies
for
a
moment
that
this
commercial
move
on
the
part
of
cowperwood
was
either
hasty
or
they
but
little
appreciate
the
incisive
apprehensive
psychology
of
the
man
his
thoughts
as
to
life
and
control
tempered
and
hardened
by
thirteen
months
of
reflection
in
the
eastern
district
penitentiary
had
given
him
a
fixed
policy
he
could
should
and
would
rule
alone
no
man
must
ever
again
have
the
least
claim
on
him
save
that
of
a
suppliant
he
wanted
no
more
dangerous
combinations
such
as
he
had
had
with
stener
the
man
through
whom
he
had
lost
so
much
in
philadelphia
and
others
by
right
of
financial
intellect
and
courage
he
was
first
and
would
so
prove
it
men
must
swing
around
him
as
planets
around
the
sun
moreover
since
his
fall
from
grace
in
philadelphia
he
had
come
to
think
that
never
again
perhaps
could
he
hope
to
become
socially
acceptable
in
the
sense
in
which
the
best
society
of
a
city
interprets
the
phrase
and
pondering
over
this
at
odd
moments
he
realized
that
his
future
allies
in
all
probability
would
not
be
among
the
rich
and
socially
important
the
clannish
snobbish
elements
of
society
but
among
the
beginners
and
financially
strong
men
who
had
come
or
were
coming
up
from
the
bottom
and
who
had
no
social
hopes
whatsoever
there
were
many
such
if
through
luck
and
effort
he
became
sufficiently
powerful
financially
he
might
then
hope
to
dictate
to
society
individualistic
and
even
anarchistic
in
character
and
without
a
shred
of
true
democracy
yet
temperamentally
he
was
in
sympathy
with
the
mass
more
than
he
was
with
the
class
and
he
understood
the
mass
better
perhaps
this
in
a
way
will
explain
his
desire
to
connect
himself
with
a
personality
so
naive
and
strange
as
peter
laughlin
he
had
annexed
him
as
a
surgeon
selects
a
special
knife
or
instrument
for
an
operation
and
shrewd
as
old
laughlin
was
he
was
destined
to
be
no
more
than
a
tool
in
cowperwood
strong
hands
a
mere
hustling
messenger
content
to
take
orders
from
this
swiftest
of
moving
brains
for
the
present
cowperwood
was
satisfied
to
do
business
under
the
firm
name
of
peter
laughlin
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
preferred
it
for
he
could
thus
keep
himself
sufficiently
inconspicuous
to
avoid
undue
attention
and
gradually
work
out
one
or
two
coups
by
which
he
hoped
to
firmly
fix
himself
in
the
financial
future
of
chicago
as
the
most
essential
preliminary
to
the
social
as
well
as
the
financial
establishment
of
himself
and
aileen
in
chicago
harper
steger
cowperwood
lawyer
was
doing
his
best
all
this
while
to
ingratiate
himself
in
the
confidence
of
cowperwood
who
had
no
faith
in
lawyers
any
more
than
she
had
in
her
recalcitrant
husband
she
was
now
a
tall
severe
and
rather
plain
woman
but
still
bearing
the
marks
of
the
former
passive
charm
that
had
once
interested
cowperwood
notable
had
come
about
the
corners
of
her
nose
mouth
and
eyes
she
had
a
remote
censorious
subdued
and
even
injured
air
the
steger
who
had
all
the
graceful
contemplative
air
of
a
prowling
tom
was
just
the
person
to
deal
with
her
a
more
suavely
cunning
and
opportunistic
soul
never
was
his
motto
might
well
have
been
speak
softly
and
step
lightly
my
dear
cowperwood
he
argued
seated
in
her
modest
west
philadelphia
parlor
one
spring
afternoon
i
need
not
tell
you
what
a
remarkable
man
your
husband
is
nor
how
useless
it
is
to
combat
him
admitting
all
his
faults
and
we
can
agree
if
you
please
that
they
are
many
cowperwood
stirred
with
irritation
still
it
is
not
worth
while
to
attempt
to
hold
him
to
a
strict
account
you
know
and
steger
opened
his
thin
artistic
hands
in
a
deprecatory
way
what
sort
of
a
man
cowperwood
is
and
whether
he
can
be
coerced
or
not
he
is
not
an
ordinary
man
cowperwood
no
man
could
have
gone
through
what
he
has
and
be
where
he
is
and
be
an
average
man
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
let
him
go
his
way
grant
him
a
divorce
he
is
willing
even
anxious
to
make
a
definite
provision
for
you
and
your
children
he
will
i
am
sure
look
liberally
after
their
future
but
he
is
becoming
very
irritable
over
your
unwillingness
to
give
him
a
legal
separation
and
unless
you
do
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
the
whole
matter
will
be
thrown
into
the
courts
if
before
it
comes
to
that
i
could
effect
an
arrangement
agreeable
to
you
i
would
be
much
pleased
as
you
know
i
have
been
greatly
grieved
by
the
whole
course
of
your
recent
affairs
i
am
intensely
sorry
that
things
are
as
they
are
steger
lifted
his
eyes
in
a
very
pained
deprecatory
way
he
regretted
deeply
the
shifty
currents
of
this
troubled
world
cowperwood
for
perhaps
the
fifteenth
or
twentieth
time
heard
him
to
the
end
in
patience
cowperwood
would
not
return
steger
was
as
much
her
friend
as
any
other
lawyer
would
be
besides
he
was
socially
agreeable
to
her
despite
his
machiavellian
profession
she
half
believed
him
he
went
over
tactfully
a
score
of
additional
points
finally
on
the
visit
and
with
seemingly
great
distress
he
told
her
that
her
husband
had
decided
to
break
with
her
financially
to
pay
no
more
bills
and
do
nothing
until
his
responsibility
had
been
fixed
by
the
courts
and
that
he
steger
was
about
to
retire
from
the
case
cowperwood
felt
that
she
must
yield
she
named
her
ultimatum
if
he
would
fix
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
her
and
the
children
this
was
cowperwood
own
suggestion
and
later
on
do
something
commercially
for
their
only
son
frank
junior
she
would
let
him
go
she
disliked
to
do
it
she
knew
that
it
meant
the
triumph
of
aileen
butler
such
as
it
was
but
after
all
that
wretched
creature
had
been
properly
disgraced
in
philadelphia
it
was
not
likely
she
could
ever
raise
her
head
socially
anywhere
any
more
she
agreed
to
file
a
plea
which
steger
would
draw
up
for
her
and
by
that
oily
gentleman
machinations
it
was
finally
wormed
through
the
local
court
in
the
most
secret
manner
imaginable
the
merest
item
in
three
of
the
philadelphia
papers
some
six
weeks
later
reported
that
a
divorce
had
been
granted
when
cowperwood
read
it
she
wondered
greatly
that
so
little
attention
had
been
attracted
by
it
she
had
feared
a
much
more
extended
comment
she
little
knew
the
prowlings
legal
and
journalistic
of
her
husband
interesting
counsel
when
cowperwood
read
it
on
one
of
his
visits
to
chicago
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
at
last
it
was
really
true
now
he
could
make
aileen
his
wife
he
telegraphed
her
an
enigmatic
message
of
congratulation
when
aileen
read
it
she
thrilled
from
head
to
foot
now
shortly
she
would
become
the
legal
bride
of
frank
algernon
cowperwood
the
newly
enfranchised
chicago
financier
and
then
oh
she
said
in
her
philadelphia
home
when
she
read
it
is
that
splendid
now
i
be
cowperwood
oh
dear
frank
algernon
cowperwood
number
one
thinking
over
her
liaison
failure
imprisonment
pyrotechnic
operations
at
the
time
of
the
jay
cooke
failure
and
his
present
financial
ascendancy
wondered
at
the
mystery
of
life
there
must
be
a
god
the
bible
said
so
her
husband
evil
though
he
was
could
not
be
utterly
bad
for
he
had
made
ample
provision
for
her
and
the
children
liked
him
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
criminal
prosecution
he
was
no
worse
than
some
others
who
had
gone
free
yet
he
had
been
convicted
and
she
was
sorry
for
that
and
had
always
been
he
was
an
able
and
ruthless
man
she
hardly
knew
what
to
think
the
one
person
she
really
did
blame
was
the
wretched
vain
ungodly
aileen
butler
who
had
been
his
seductress
and
was
probably
now
to
be
his
wife
god
would
punish
her
no
doubt
he
must
so
she
went
to
church
on
sundays
and
tried
to
believe
come
what
might
that
all
was
for
the
best
chapter
vi
the
new
queen
of
the
home
the
day
cowperwood
and
aileen
were
married
it
was
in
an
obscure
village
called
dalston
near
pittsburg
in
western
pennsylvania
where
they
had
stopped
off
to
manage
this
matter
he
had
said
to
her
i
want
to
tell
you
dear
that
you
and
i
are
really
beginning
life
all
over
now
it
depends
on
how
well
we
play
this
game
as
to
how
well
we
succeed
if
you
will
listen
to
me
we
wo
try
to
do
anything
much
socially
in
chicago
for
the
present
of
course
we
have
to
meet
a
few
people
that
ca
be
avoided
and
addison
are
anxious
to
meet
you
and
i
delayed
too
long
in
that
matter
as
it
is
but
what
i
mean
is
that
i
do
believe
it
advisable
to
push
this
social
exchange
too
far
people
are
sure
to
begin
to
make
inquiries
if
we
do
my
plan
is
to
wait
a
little
while
and
then
build
a
really
fine
house
so
that
we
wo
need
to
rebuild
we
going
to
go
to
europe
next
spring
if
things
go
right
and
we
may
get
some
ideas
over
there
i
going
to
put
in
a
good
big
gallery
he
concluded
while
we
traveling
we
might
as
well
see
what
we
can
find
in
the
way
of
pictures
and
so
on
aileen
was
thrilling
with
anticipation
oh
frank
she
said
to
him
quite
ecstatically
you
so
wonderful
you
do
everything
you
want
do
you
not
quite
he
said
deprecatingly
but
it
is
for
not
wanting
to
chance
has
a
little
to
say
about
some
of
these
chings
aileen
she
stood
in
front
of
him
as
she
often
did
her
plump
ringed
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
into
those
steady
lucid
pools
his
eyes
another
man
less
leonine
and
with
all
his
shifting
thoughts
might
have
had
to
contend
with
the
handicap
of
a
shifty
gaze
he
fronted
the
queries
and
suspicions
of
the
world
with
a
seeming
candor
that
was
as
disarming
as
that
of
a
child
the
truth
was
he
believed
in
himself
and
himself
only
and
thence
sprang
his
courage
to
think
as
he
pleased
aileen
wondered
but
could
get
no
answer
oh
you
big
tiger
she
said
you
great
big
lion
boo
he
pinched
her
cheek
and
smiled
poor
aileen
he
thought
she
little
knew
the
unsolvable
mystery
that
he
was
even
to
himself
to
himself
most
of
all
immediately
after
their
marriage
cowperwood
and
aileen
journeyed
to
chicago
direct
and
took
the
best
rooms
that
the
tremont
provided
for
the
time
being
a
little
later
they
heard
of
a
comparatively
small
furnished
house
at
and
michigan
avenue
which
with
horses
and
carriages
thrown
in
was
to
be
had
for
a
season
or
two
on
lease
they
contracted
for
it
at
once
installing
a
butler
servants
and
the
general
service
of
a
home
here
because
he
thought
it
was
only
courteous
and
not
because
he
thought
it
was
essential
or
wise
at
this
time
to
attempt
a
social
onslaught
he
invited
the
addisons
and
one
or
two
others
whom
he
felt
sure
would
come
alexander
rambaud
president
of
the
chicago
northwestern
and
his
wife
and
taylor
lord
an
architect
whom
he
had
recently
called
into
consultation
and
whom
he
found
socially
acceptable
lord
like
the
addisons
was
in
society
but
only
as
a
minor
figure
trust
cowperwood
to
do
the
thing
as
it
should
be
done
the
place
they
had
leased
was
a
charming
little
house
with
a
neat
flight
of
granite
balustraded
steps
leading
up
to
its
door
and
a
judicious
use
of
stained
glass
to
give
its
interior
an
artistically
subdued
atmosphere
fortunately
it
was
furnished
in
good
taste
cowperwood
turned
over
the
matter
of
the
dinner
to
a
caterer
and
decorator
aileen
had
nothing
to
do
but
dress
and
wait
and
look
her
best
i
need
tell
you
he
said
in
the
morning
on
leaving
that
i
want
you
to
look
nice
pet
i
want
the
addisons
and
rambaud
to
like
you
a
hint
was
more
than
sufficient
for
aileen
though
really
it
was
not
needed
on
arriving
at
chicago
she
had
sought
and
discovered
a
french
maid
although
she
had
brought
plenty
of
dresses
from
philadelphia
she
had
been
having
additional
winter
costumes
prepared
by
the
best
and
most
expensive
mistress
of
the
art
in
chicago
theresa
donovan
only
the
day
before
she
had
welcomed
home
a
silk
under
heavy
green
lace
which
with
her
hair
and
her
white
arms
and
neck
seemed
to
constitute
an
unusual
harmony
her
boudoir
on
the
night
of
the
dinner
presented
a
veritable
riot
of
silks
satins
laces
lingerie
hair
ornaments
perfumes
jewels
anything
and
everything
which
might
contribute
to
the
feminine
art
of
being
beautiful
once
in
the
throes
of
a
toilet
composition
aileen
invariably
became
restless
and
energetic
almost
fidgety
and
her
maid
fadette
was
compelled
to
move
quickly
fresh
from
her
bath
a
smooth
ivory
venus
she
worked
quickly
through
silken
lingerie
stockings
and
shoes
to
her
hair
fadette
had
an
idea
to
suggest
for
the
hair
would
madame
let
her
try
a
new
swirl
she
had
seen
madame
would
yes
so
there
were
movings
of
her
mass
of
rich
glinting
tresses
this
way
and
that
somehow
it
would
not
do
a
braided
effect
was
then
tried
and
instantly
discarded
finally
a
double
looping
without
braids
low
over
the
forehead
caught
back
with
two
bands
crossing
like
an
x
above
the
center
of
her
forehead
and
fastened
with
a
diamond
sunburst
served
admirably
in
her
filmy
lacy
boudoir
costume
of
pink
silk
aileen
stood
up
and
surveyed
herself
in
the
mirror
yes
she
said
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
then
came
the
dress
from
donovan
rustling
and
crisping
she
slipped
into
it
wonderingly
critically
while
fadette
worked
at
the
back
the
arms
about
her
knees
doing
one
little
essential
thing
after
another
oh
madame
she
exclaimed
oh
charmant
ze
hair
it
go
weeth
it
perfect
it
ees
so
full
so
beyutiful
here
she
pointed
to
the
hips
where
the
lace
formed
a
clinging
basque
oh
tees
varee
varee
nize
aileen
glowed
but
with
scarcely
a
smile
she
was
concerned
it
was
so
much
her
toilet
which
must
be
everything
that
it
should
be
but
this
addison
who
was
so
rich
and
in
society
and
rambaud
who
was
very
powerful
frank
said
must
like
her
it
was
the
necessity
to
put
her
best
foot
forward
now
that
was
really
troubling
her
she
must
interest
these
men
mentally
perhaps
as
well
as
physically
and
with
social
graces
and
that
was
not
so
easy
for
all
her
money
and
comfort
in
philadelphia
she
had
never
been
in
society
in
its
best
aspects
had
never
done
social
entertaining
of
any
real
importance
frank
was
the
most
important
man
who
had
ever
crossed
her
path
no
doubt
rambaud
had
a
severe
wife
how
would
she
talk
to
her
and
addison
she
would
know
and
see
everything
aileen
almost
talked
out
loud
to
herself
in
a
consoling
way
as
she
dressed
so
strenuous
were
her
thoughts
but
she
went
on
adding
the
last
touches
to
her
physical
graces
when
she
finally
went
to
see
how
the
dining
and
reception
rooms
looked
and
fadette
began
putting
away
the
welter
of
discarded
garments
she
was
a
radiant
vision
a
splendid
figure
with
gorgeous
hair
smooth
soft
shapely
ivory
arms
a
splendid
neck
and
bust
and
a
swelling
form
she
felt
beautiful
and
yet
she
was
a
little
nervous
truly
frank
himself
would
be
critical
she
went
about
looking
into
the
which
by
the
caterer
art
had
been
transformed
into
a
kind
of
glowing
with
flowers
silver
gold
tinted
glass
and
the
snowy
whiteness
of
linen
it
reminded
her
of
an
opal
flashing
all
its
soft
fires
she
went
into
the
general
where
was
a
grand
piano
finished
in
pink
and
gold
upon
which
with
due
thought
to
her
one
accomplishment
her
playing
she
had
arranged
the
songs
and
instrumental
pieces
she
did
best
aileen
was
really
not
a
brilliant
musician
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
matronly
as
if
now
she
were
not
a
girl
any
more
but
a
woman
grown
with
some
serious
responsibilities
and
yet
she
was
not
really
suited
to
the
role
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
thoughts
were
always
fixed
on
the
artistic
social
and
dramatic
aspects
of
life
with
unfortunately
a
kind
of
nebulosity
of
conception
which
permitted
no
condensation
into
anything
definite
or
concrete
she
could
only
be
wildly
and
feverishly
interested
just
then
the
door
clicked
to
frank
key
it
was
nearing
six
and
in
he
came
smiling
confident
a
perfect
atmosphere
of
assurance
well
he
observed
surveying
her
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
lighted
by
wall
candles
judiciously
arranged
who
the
vision
floating
around
here
i
almost
afraid
to
touch
you
much
powder
on
those
arms
he
drew
her
into
his
arms
and
she
put
up
her
mouth
with
a
sense
of
relief
obviously
he
must
think
that
she
looked
charming
i
am
chalky
i
guess
you
just
have
to
stand
it
though
going
to
dress
anyhow
she
put
her
smooth
plump
arms
about
his
neck
and
he
felt
pleased
this
was
the
kind
of
a
woman
to
have
a
beauty
her
neck
was
resplendent
with
a
string
of
turquoise
her
fingers
too
heavily
jeweled
but
still
beautiful
she
was
faintly
redolent
of
hyacinth
or
lavender
her
hair
appealed
to
him
and
above
all
the
rich
yellow
silk
of
her
dress
flashing
fulgurously
through
the
closely
netted
green
charming
girlie
you
outdone
yourself
i
have
seen
this
dress
before
where
did
you
get
it
here
in
chicago
he
lifted
her
warm
fingers
surveying
her
train
and
turned
her
about
you
do
need
any
advice
you
ought
to
start
a
school
am
i
all
right
she
queried
smartly
but
with
a
sense
of
for
the
moment
and
all
because
of
him
you
perfect
could
be
nicer
splendid
she
took
heart
i
wish
your
friends
would
think
so
you
better
hurry
he
went
and
she
followed
looking
first
into
the
again
at
least
that
was
right
surely
frank
was
a
master
at
seven
the
plop
of
the
feet
of
was
heard
and
a
moment
later
louis
the
butler
was
opening
the
door
aileen
went
down
a
little
nervous
a
little
frigid
trying
to
think
of
many
pleasant
things
and
wondering
whether
she
would
really
succeed
in
being
entertaining
cowperwood
accompanied
her
a
very
different
person
in
so
far
as
mood
and
were
concerned
to
himself
his
own
future
was
always
secure
and
that
of
aileen
if
he
wished
to
make
it
so
the
arduous
rungs
of
the
social
ladder
that
were
troubling
her
had
no
such
significance
to
him
the
dinner
as
such
simple
things
go
was
a
success
from
what
might
be
called
a
managerial
and
pictorial
point
of
view
cowperwood
because
of
his
varied
tastes
and
interests
could
discuss
railroading
with
rambaud
in
a
very
definite
and
illuminating
way
could
talk
architecture
with
lord
as
a
student
for
instance
of
rare
promise
would
talk
with
a
master
and
with
a
woman
like
addison
or
rambaud
he
could
suggest
or
follow
appropriate
leads
aileen
unfortunately
was
not
so
much
at
home
for
her
natural
state
and
mood
were
remote
not
so
much
from
a
serious
as
from
an
accurate
conception
of
life
so
many
things
except
in
a
very
nebulous
and
suggestive
way
were
sealed
books
to
aileen
merely
faint
distant
tinklings
she
knew
nothing
of
literature
except
certain
authors
who
to
the
truly
cultured
might
seem
banal
as
for
art
it
was
merely
a
jingle
of
names
gathered
from
cowperwood
private
comments
her
one
redeeming
feature
was
that
she
was
truly
beautiful
herself
a
radiant
vibrating
objet
a
man
like
rambaud
remote
conservative
constructive
saw
the
place
of
a
woman
like
aileen
in
the
life
of
a
man
like
cowperwood
on
the
instant
she
was
such
a
woman
as
he
would
have
prized
himself
in
a
certain
capacity
sex
interest
in
all
strong
men
usually
endures
unto
the
end
governed
sometimes
by
a
stoic
resignation
the
experiment
of
such
attraction
can
as
they
well
know
be
made
over
and
over
but
to
what
end
for
many
it
becomes
too
troublesome
yet
the
presence
of
so
glittering
a
spectacle
as
aileen
on
this
night
touched
rambaud
with
an
ancient
ambition
he
looked
at
her
almost
sadly
once
he
was
much
younger
but
alas
he
had
never
attracted
the
flaming
interest
of
any
such
woman
as
he
studied
her
now
he
wished
that
he
might
have
enjoyed
such
good
fortune
in
contrast
with
aileen
orchid
glow
and
tinted
richness
rambaud
simple
gray
silk
the
collar
of
which
came
almost
to
her
ears
was
disturbing
almost
reproving
but
rambaud
ladylike
courtesy
and
generosity
made
everything
all
right
she
came
out
of
intellectual
new
england
the
phillips
school
of
philosophy
and
was
broadly
tolerant
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
liked
aileen
and
all
the
orient
richness
she
represented
such
a
sweet
little
house
this
is
she
said
smilingly
we
noticed
it
often
we
not
so
far
removed
from
you
but
what
we
might
be
called
neighbors
aileen
eyes
spoke
appreciation
although
she
could
not
fully
grasp
rambaud
she
understood
her
in
a
way
and
liked
her
she
was
probably
something
like
her
own
mother
would
have
been
if
the
latter
had
been
highly
educated
while
they
were
moving
into
the
taylor
lord
was
announced
cowperwood
took
his
hand
and
brought
him
forward
to
the
others
cowperwood
said
lord
admiringly
a
tall
rugged
thoughtful
person
let
me
be
one
of
many
to
welcome
you
to
chicago
after
philadelphia
you
will
find
some
things
to
desire
at
first
but
we
all
come
to
like
it
eventually
oh
i
sure
i
shall
smiled
aileen
i
lived
in
philadelphia
years
ago
but
only
for
a
little
while
added
lord
i
left
there
to
come
here
the
observation
gave
aileen
the
least
pause
but
she
passed
it
over
lightly
this
sort
of
accidental
reference
she
must
learn
to
expect
there
might
be
much
worse
bridges
to
cross
i
find
chicago
all
right
she
replied
briskly
there
nothing
the
matter
with
it
it
has
more
snap
than
philadelphia
ever
had
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
like
it
so
much
perhaps
because
i
find
such
interesting
things
to
do
here
he
was
admiring
the
splendor
of
her
arms
and
hair
what
need
had
beautiful
woman
to
be
intellectual
anyhow
he
was
saying
to
himself
sensing
that
aileen
might
be
deficient
in
ultimate
refinement
once
more
an
announcement
from
the
butler
and
now
and
addison
entered
addison
was
not
at
all
concerned
over
coming
here
liked
the
idea
of
it
his
own
position
and
that
of
his
wife
in
chicago
was
secure
how
are
you
cowperwood
he
beamed
laying
one
hand
on
the
latter
shoulder
this
is
fine
of
you
to
have
us
in
cowperwood
i
been
telling
your
husband
for
nearly
a
year
now
that
he
should
bring
you
out
here
did
he
tell
you
addison
had
not
as
yet
confided
to
his
wife
the
true
history
of
cowperwood
and
aileen
yes
indeed
replied
aileen
gaily
feeling
that
addison
was
charmed
by
her
beauty
i
been
wanting
to
come
too
it
his
fault
that
i
was
here
sooner
addison
looking
circumspectly
at
aileen
said
to
himself
that
she
was
certainly
a
woman
so
she
was
the
cause
of
the
first
wife
suit
no
wonder
what
a
splendid
creature
he
contrasted
her
with
addison
and
to
his
wife
disadvantage
she
had
never
been
as
striking
as
as
aileen
though
possibly
she
might
have
more
sense
jove
if
he
could
find
a
woman
like
aileen
life
would
take
on
a
new
luster
and
yet
he
had
women
very
carefully
very
subterraneously
but
he
had
them
it
such
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
addison
a
corpulent
bejeweled
lady
was
saying
to
aileen
my
husband
and
yours
have
become
the
best
of
friends
apparently
we
must
see
more
of
each
other
she
babbled
on
in
a
puffy
social
way
and
aileen
felt
as
though
she
were
getting
along
swiftly
the
butler
brought
in
a
great
tray
of
appetizers
and
cordials
and
put
them
softly
on
a
remote
table
dinner
was
served
and
the
talk
flowed
on
they
discussed
the
growth
of
the
city
a
new
church
that
lord
was
building
ten
blocks
farther
out
rambaud
told
about
some
humorous
land
swindles
it
was
quite
gay
meanwhile
aileen
did
her
best
to
become
interested
in
rambaud
and
addison
she
liked
the
latter
somewhat
better
solely
because
it
was
a
little
easier
to
talk
to
her
rambaud
aileen
knew
to
be
the
wiser
and
more
charitable
woman
but
she
frightened
her
a
little
presently
she
had
to
fall
back
on
lord
help
he
came
to
her
rescue
gallantly
talking
of
everything
that
came
into
his
mind
all
the
men
outside
of
cowperwood
were
thinking
how
splendid
aileen
was
physically
how
white
were
her
arms
how
rounded
her
neck
and
shoulders
how
rich
her
hair
chapter

chicago
gas
old
peter
laughlin
rejuvenated
by
cowperwood
electric
ideas
was
making
money
for
the
house
he
brought
many
bits
of
interesting
gossip
from
the
floor
and
such
shrewd
guesses
as
to
what
certain
groups
and
individuals
were
up
to
that
cowperwood
was
able
to
make
some
very
brilliant
deductions
by
gosh
frank
i
think
i
know
exactly
what
them
fellers
are
trying
to
do
laughlin
would
frequently
remark
of
a
morning
after
he
had
lain
in
his
lonely
harrison
street
bed
meditating
the
major
portion
of
the
night
that
there
stock
yards
gang
and
by
gang
he
meant
most
of
the
great
manipulators
like
arneel
hand
schryhart
and
others
are
after
corn
again
we
want
to
git
long
o
that
now
or
i
miss
my
guess
what
do
you
think
huh
cowperwood
schooled
by
now
in
many
western
subtleties
which
he
had
not
previously
known
and
daily
becoming
wiser
would
as
a
rule
give
an
instantaneous
decision
you
right
risk
a
hundred
thousand
bushels
i
think
new
york
central
is
going
to
drop
a
point
or
two
in
a
few
days
we
better
go
short
a
point
laughlin
could
never
figure
out
quite
how
it
was
that
cowperwood
always
seemed
to
know
and
was
ready
to
act
quite
as
quickly
in
local
matters
as
he
was
himself
he
understood
his
wisdom
concerning
eastern
shares
and
things
dealt
in
on
the
eastern
exchange
but
these
chicago
matters
whut
makes
you
think
that
he
asked
cowperwood
one
day
quite
curiously
why
peter
cowperwood
replied
quite
simply
anton
videra
one
of
the
directors
of
the
wheat
and
corn
bank
was
in
here
yesterday
while
you
were
on
and
he
was
telling
me
he
described
a
situation
which
videra
had
outlined
laughlin
knew
videra
as
a
strong
wealthy
pole
who
had
come
up
in
the
last
few
years
it
was
strange
how
cowperwood
naturally
got
in
with
these
wealthy
men
and
won
their
confidence
so
quickly
videra
would
never
have
become
so
confidential
with
him
huh
he
exclaimed
well
if
he
says
it
it
likely
so
so
laughlin
bought
and
peter
laughlin
won
but
this
grain
and
commission
business
while
it
was
yielding
a
profit
which
would
average
about
twenty
thousand
a
year
to
each
partner
was
nothing
more
to
cowperwood
than
a
source
of
information
he
wanted
to
get
in
on
something
that
was
sure
to
bring
very
great
returns
within
a
reasonable
time
and
that
would
not
leave
him
in
any
such
desperate
situation
as
he
was
at
the
time
of
the
chicago
fire
spread
out
very
thin
as
he
put
it
he
had
interested
in
his
ventures
a
small
group
of
chicago
men
who
were
watching
him
judah
addison
alexander
rambaud
millard
bailey
anton
videra
men
who
although
not
supreme
figures
by
any
means
had
free
capital
he
knew
that
he
could
go
to
them
with
any
truly
sound
proposition
the
one
thing
that
most
attracted
his
attention
was
the
chicago
gas
situation
because
there
was
a
chance
to
step
in
almost
unheralded
in
an
as
yet
unoccupied
territory
with
franchises
once
secured
the
reader
can
quite
imagine
how
he
could
present
himself
like
a
hamilcar
barca
in
the
heart
of
spain
or
a
hannibal
at
the
gates
of
rome
with
a
demand
for
surrender
and
a
division
of
spoils
there
were
at
this
time
three
gas
companies
operating
in
the
three
different
divisions
of
the
city
the
three
sections
or
sides
as
they
were
called
south
west
and
north
and
of
these
the
chicago
gas
light
and
coke
company
organized
in
to
do
business
on
the
south
side
was
the
most
flourishing
and
important
the
people
gas
light
and
coke
company
doing
business
on
the
west
side
was
a
few
years
younger
than
the
south
chicago
company
and
had
been
allowed
to
spring
into
existence
through
the
foolish
of
the
organizer
and
directors
of
the
south
side
company
who
had
fancied
that
neither
the
west
side
nor
the
north
side
was
going
to
develop
very
rapidly
for
a
number
of
years
to
come
and
had
counted
on
the
city
council
allowing
them
to
extend
their
mains
at
any
time
to
these
other
portions
of
the
city
a
third
company
the
north
chicago
gas
illuminating
company
had
been
organized
almost
simultaneously
with
the
west
side
company
by
the
same
process
through
which
the
other
companies
had
been
brought
into
life
their
avowed
intention
like
that
of
the
west
side
company
being
to
confine
their
activities
to
the
sections
from
which
the
organizers
presumably
came
cowperwood
first
project
was
to
buy
out
and
combine
the
three
old
city
companies
with
this
in
view
he
looked
up
the
holders
in
all
three
corporations
their
financial
and
social
status
it
was
his
idea
that
by
offering
them
three
for
one
or
even
four
for
one
for
every
dollar
represented
by
the
market
value
of
their
stock
he
might
buy
in
and
capitalize
the
three
companies
as
one
then
by
issuing
sufficient
stock
to
cover
all
his
obligations
he
would
reap
a
rich
harvest
and
at
the
same
time
leave
himself
in
charge
he
approached
judah
addison
first
as
the
most
available
man
to
help
float
a
scheme
of
this
kind
he
did
not
want
him
as
a
partner
so
much
as
he
wanted
him
as
an
investor
well
i
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
this
said
addison
finally
you
hit
on
a
great
idea
here
it
a
wonder
it
has
occurred
to
some
one
else
before
and
you
want
to
keep
rather
quiet
about
it
or
some
one
else
will
rush
in
and
do
it
we
have
a
lot
of
venturesome
men
out
here
but
i
like
you
and
i
with
you
now
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
go
in
on
this
personally
not
openly
anyhow
but
i
promise
to
see
that
you
get
some
of
the
money
you
want
i
like
your
idea
of
a
central
holding
company
or
pool
with
you
in
charge
as
trustee
and
i
perfectly
willing
that
you
should
manage
it
for
i
think
you
can
do
it
anyhow
that
leaves
me
out
apparently
except
as
an
investor
but
you
will
have
to
get
two
or
three
others
to
help
carry
this
guarantee
with
me
have
you
any
one
in
mind
oh
yes
replied
cowperwood
certainly
i
merely
came
to
you
first
he
mentioned
rambaud
videra
bailey
and
others
they
all
right
said
addison
if
you
can
get
them
but
i
not
sure
even
then
that
you
can
induce
these
other
fellows
to
sell
out
they
not
investors
in
the
ordinary
sense
they
people
who
look
on
this
gas
business
as
their
private
business
they
started
it
they
like
it
they
built
the
and
laid
the
mains
it
wo
be
easy
cowperwood
found
as
addison
predicted
that
it
was
not
such
an
easy
matter
to
induce
the
various
and
directors
in
the
old
companies
to
come
in
on
any
such
scheme
of
reorganization
a
closer
more
unresponsive
set
of
men
he
was
satisfied
he
had
never
met
his
offer
to
buy
outright
at
three
or
four
for
one
they
refused
absolutely
the
stock
in
each
case
was
selling
from
one
hundred
and
seventy
to
two
hundred
and
ten
and
intrinsically
was
worth
more
every
year
as
the
city
was
growing
larger
and
its
need
of
gas
greater
at
the
same
time
they
were
suspicious
one
and
all
of
any
combination
scheme
by
an
outsider
who
was
he
whom
did
he
represent
he
could
make
it
clear
that
he
had
ample
capital
but
not
who
his
backers
were
the
old
officers
and
directors
fancied
that
it
was
a
scheme
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
officers
and
directors
of
one
of
the
other
companies
to
get
control
and
oust
them
why
should
they
sell
why
be
tempted
by
greater
profits
from
their
stock
when
they
were
doing
very
well
as
it
was
because
of
his
newness
to
chicago
and
his
lack
of
connection
as
yet
with
large
affairs
cowperwood
was
eventually
compelled
to
turn
to
another
scheme
that
of
organizing
new
companies
in
the
suburbs
as
an
of
attack
upon
the
city
proper
suburbs
such
as
lake
view
and
hyde
park
having
town
or
village
councils
of
their
own
were
permitted
to
grant
franchises
to
water
gas
and
companies
duly
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
the
state
cowperwood
calculated
that
if
he
could
form
separate
and
seemingly
distinct
companies
for
each
of
the
villages
and
towns
and
one
general
company
for
the
city
later
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
dictate
terms
to
the
older
organizations
it
was
simply
a
question
of
obtaining
his
charters
and
franchises
before
his
rivals
had
awakened
to
the
situation
the
one
difficulty
was
that
he
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
the
business
of
gas
its
practical
manufacture
and
distribution
and
had
never
been
particularly
interested
init
his
favorite
form
of
municipal
and
one
upon
which
he
had
acquired
an
almost
endless
fund
of
specialized
information
offered
no
present
practical
opportunity
for
him
here
in
chicago
he
meditated
on
the
situation
did
some
reading
on
the
manufacture
of
gas
and
then
suddenly
as
was
his
luck
found
an
implement
ready
to
his
hand
it
appeared
that
in
the
course
of
the
life
and
growth
of
the
south
side
company
there
had
once
been
a
smaller
organization
founded
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
sippens
henry
de
soto
sippens
who
had
entered
and
actually
secured
by
some
a
franchise
to
manufacture
and
sell
gas
in
the
districts
but
who
had
been
annoyed
by
all
sorts
of
legal
processes
until
he
had
finally
been
driven
out
or
persuaded
to
get
out
he
was
now
in
the
business
in
lake
view
old
peter
laughlin
knew
him
he
a
smart
little
cuss
laughlin
told
cowperwood
i
thort
onct
he
make
a
go
of
it
but
they
ketched
him
where
his
hair
was
short
and
he
had
to
let
go
there
was
an
explosion
in
his
tank
over
here
near
the
river
onct
an
i
think
he
thort
them
fellers
blew
him
up
anyhow
he
got
out
i
ai
seen
ner
heard
sight
of
him
fer
years
cowperwood
sent
old
peter
to
look
up
sippens
and
find
out
what
he
was
really
doing
and
whether
he
would
be
interested
to
get
back
in
the
gas
business
enter
then
a
few
days
later
into
the
office
of
peter
laughlin
henry
de
soto
sippens
he
was
a
very
little
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
he
wore
a
high
stiff
felt
hat
with
a
short
brown
business
coat
which
in
summer
became
seersucker
and
shoes
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
country
drug
or
book
store
owner
with
perhaps
the
air
of
a
country
doctor
or
lawyer
superadded
his
cuffs
protruded
too
far
from
his
his
necktie
bulged
too
far
out
of
his
vest
and
his
high
hat
was
set
a
little
too
far
back
on
his
forehead
otherwise
he
was
acceptable
pleasant
and
interesting
he
had
short
reddish
brown
which
stuck
out
quite
defiantly
and
his
eyebrows
were
heavy
sippens
said
cowperwood
blandly
you
were
once
in
the
gas
manufacturing
and
distributing
business
here
in
chicago
were
you
i
think
i
know
as
much
about
the
manufacture
of
gas
as
any
one
replied
sippens
almost
contentiously
i
worked
at
it
for
a
number
of
years
well
now
sippens
i
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
interesting
to
start
a
little
gas
company
in
one
of
these
outlying
villages
that
are
growing
so
fast
and
see
if
we
could
make
some
money
out
of
it
not
a
practical
gas
man
myself
but
i
thought
i
might
interest
some
one
who
was
he
looked
at
sippens
in
a
friendly
estimating
way
i
have
heard
of
you
as
some
one
who
has
had
considerable
experience
in
this
field
here
in
chicago
if
i
should
get
up
a
company
of
this
kind
with
considerable
backing
do
you
think
you
might
be
willing
to
take
the
management
of
it
oh
i
know
all
about
this
gas
field
sippens
was
about
to
say
it
ca
be
done
but
he
changed
his
mind
before
opening
his
lips
if
i
were
paid
enough
he
said
cautiously
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
to
contend
with
oh
yes
cowperwood
replied
smiling
what
would
you
consider
enough
to
mean
oh
if
i
were
given
six
thousand
a
year
and
a
sufficient
interest
in
the
company
say
a
half
or
something
like
that
i
might
consider
it
replied
sippens
determined
as
he
thought
to
frighten
cowperwood
off
by
his
exorbitant
demands
he
was
making
almost
six
thousand
dollars
a
year
out
of
his
present
business
you
would
think
that
four
thousand
in
several
companies
say
up
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
an
interest
of
about
a
tenth
in
each
would
be
better
sippens
meditated
carefully
on
this
plainly
the
man
before
him
was
no
trifling
beginner
he
looked
at
cowperwood
shrewdly
and
saw
at
once
without
any
additional
explanation
of
any
kind
that
the
latter
was
preparing
a
big
fight
of
some
sort
ten
years
before
sippens
had
sensed
the
immense
possibilities
of
the
gas
business
he
had
tried
to
get
in
on
it
but
had
been
sued
waylaid
enjoined
financially
blockaded
and
finally
blown
up
he
had
always
resented
the
treatment
he
had
received
and
he
had
bitterly
regretted
his
inability
to
retaliate
he
had
thought
his
days
of
financial
effort
were
over
but
here
was
a
man
who
was
subtly
suggesting
a
stirring
fight
and
who
was
calling
him
like
a
hunter
with
horn
to
the
chase
well
cowperwood
he
replied
with
less
defiance
and
more
camaraderie
if
you
could
show
me
that
you
have
a
legitimate
proposition
in
hand
i
am
a
practical
gas
man
i
know
all
about
mains
franchise
contracts
and
i
organized
and
installed
the
plant
at
dayton
ohio
and
rochester
new
york
i
would
have
been
rich
if
i
had
got
here
a
little
earlier
the
echo
of
regret
was
in
his
voice
well
now
here
your
chance
sippens
urged
cowperwood
subtly
between
you
and
me
there
going
to
be
a
big
new
gas
company
in
the
field
we
make
these
old
fellows
step
up
and
see
us
quickly
does
that
interest
you
there
be
plenty
of
money
it
is
that
that
wanting
it
an
organizer
a
fighter
a
practical
gas
man
to
build
the
plant
lay
the
mains
and
so
on
cowperwood
rose
suddenly
straight
and
determined
a
trick
with
him
when
he
wanted
to
really
impress
any
one
he
seemed
to
radiate
force
conquest
victory
do
you
want
to
come
in
yes
i
do
mr
cowperwood
exclaimed
sippens
jumping
to
his
feet
putting
on
his
hat
and
shoving
it
far
back
on
his
head
he
looked
like
a
bantam
rooster
cowperwood
took
his
extended
hand
get
your
affairs
in
order
i
want
you
to
get
me
a
franchise
in
lake
view
shortly
and
build
me
a
plant
i
give
you
all
the
help
you
need
i
arrange
everything
to
your
satisfaction
within
a
week
or
so
we
will
want
a
good
lawyer
or
two
sippens
smiled
ecstatically
as
he
left
the
office
oh
the
wonder
of
this
and
after
ten
years
now
he
would
show
those
crooks
now
he
had
a
real
fighter
behind
him
a
man
like
himself
now
by
george
the
fur
would
begin
to
fly
who
was
this
man
anyhow
what
a
wonder
he
would
look
him
up
he
knew
that
from
now
on
he
would
do
almost
anything
cowperwood
wanted
him
to
do
chapter
viii
now
this
is
fighting
when
cowperwood
after
failing
in
his
overtures
to
the
three
city
gas
companies
confided
to
addison
his
plan
of
organizing
rival
companies
in
the
suburbs
the
banker
glared
at
him
appreciatively
you
a
smart
one
he
finally
exclaimed
you
do
i
back
you
to
win
he
went
on
to
advise
cowperwood
that
he
would
need
the
assistance
of
some
of
the
strong
men
on
the
various
village
councils
they
all
as
crooked
as
eels
teeth
he
went
on
but
there
are
one
or
two
that
are
more
crooked
than
others
and
safer
have
you
got
your
lawyer
i
have
picked
one
yet
but
i
will
i
looking
around
for
the
right
man
now
well
of
course
i
need
tell
you
how
important
that
is
there
is
one
man
old
general
van
sickle
who
has
had
considerable
training
in
these
matters
he
fairly
reliable
the
entrance
of
judson
van
sickle
threw
at
the
very
outset
a
suggestive
light
on
the
whole
situation
the
old
soldier
over
fifty
had
been
a
general
of
division
during
the
civil
war
and
had
got
his
real
start
in
life
by
filing
false
titles
to
property
in
southern
illinois
and
then
bringing
suits
to
substantiate
his
fraudulent
claims
before
friendly
associates
he
was
now
a
prosperous
requiring
heavy
retainers
and
yet
not
there
was
only
one
kind
of
business
that
came
to
the
general
this
kind
and
one
instinctively
compared
him
to
that
decoy
sheep
at
the
that
had
been
trained
to
go
forth
into
nervous
frightened
flocks
of
its
balking
at
being
driven
into
the
and
lead
them
peacefully
into
the
shambles
knowing
enough
always
to
make
his
own
way
quietly
to
the
rear
during
the
onward
progress
and
thus
escape
a
dusty
old
lawyer
this
with
heaven
knows
what
welter
of
altered
wills
broken
promises
suborned
juries
influenced
judges
bribed
councilmen
and
legislators
agreements
and
contracts
and
a
whole
world
of
shifty
legal
calculations
and
false
pretenses
floating
around
in
his
brain
among
the
politicians
judges
and
lawyers
generally
by
reason
of
past
useful
services
he
was
supposed
to
have
some
powerful
connections
he
liked
to
be
called
into
any
case
largely
because
it
meant
something
to
do
and
kept
him
from
being
bored
when
compelled
to
keep
an
appointment
in
winter
he
would
slip
on
an
old
greatcoat
of
gray
twill
that
he
had
worn
until
it
was
shabby
then
taking
down
a
soft
felt
hat
twisted
and
pulled
out
of
shape
by
use
he
would
pull
it
low
over
his
dull
gray
eyes
and
amble
forth
in
summer
his
clothes
looked
as
crinkled
as
though
he
had
slept
in
them
for
weeks
he
smoked
in
cast
of
countenance
he
was
not
wholly
unlike
general
grant
with
a
short
gray
beard
and
mustache
which
always
seemed
more
or
less
unkempt
and
hair
that
hung
down
over
his
forehead
in
a
gray
mass
the
poor
general
he
was
neither
very
happy
nor
very
unhappy
a
doubting
thomas
without
faith
or
hope
in
humanity
and
without
any
particular
affection
for
anybody
i
tell
you
how
it
is
with
these
small
councils
cowperwood
observed
van
sickle
sagely
after
the
preliminaries
of
the
first
interview
had
been
dispensed
with
they
worse
than
the
city
council
almost
and
that
about
as
bad
as
it
can
be
you
ca
do
anything
without
money
where
these
little
fellows
are
concerned
i
do
like
to
be
too
hard
on
men
but
these
fellows
he
shook
his
head
i
understand
commented
cowperwood
they
not
very
pleasing
even
after
you
make
all
allowances
most
of
them
went
on
the
general
wo
stay
put
when
you
think
you
have
them
they
sell
out
they
just
as
apt
as
not
to
run
to
this
north
side
gas
company
and
tell
them
all
about
the
whole
thing
before
you
get
well
under
way
then
you
have
to
pay
them
more
money
rival
bills
will
be
introduced
and
all
that
the
old
general
pulled
a
long
face
still
there
are
one
or
two
of
them
that
are
all
right
he
added
if
you
can
once
get
them
interested
duniway
and
mr
gerecht
i
not
so
much
concerned
with
how
it
has
to
be
done
general
suggested
cowperwood
amiably
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
it
will
be
done
quickly
and
quietly
i
do
want
to
be
bothered
with
details
can
it
be
done
without
too
much
publicity
and
about
what
do
you
think
it
is
going
to
cost
well
that
pretty
hard
to
say
until
i
look
into
the
matter
said
the
general
thoughtfully
it
might
cost
only
four
and
it
might
cost
all
of
forty
thousand
dollars
even
more
i
ca
tell
i
like
to
take
a
little
time
and
look
into
it
the
old
gentleman
was
wondering
how
much
cowperwood
was
prepared
to
spend
well
we
wo
bother
about
that
now
i
willing
to
be
as
liberal
as
necessary
i
sent
for
sippens
the
president
of
the
lake
view
gas
and
fuel
company
and
he
be
here
in
a
little
while
you
will
want
to
work
with
him
as
closely
as
you
can
the
energetic
sippens
came
after
a
few
moments
and
he
and
van
sickle
after
being
instructed
to
be
mutually
helpful
and
to
keep
cowperwood
name
out
of
all
matters
relating
to
this
work
departed
together
they
were
an
odd
pair
the
dusty
old
general
phlegmatic
disillusioned
useful
but
not
inclined
to
feel
so
and
the
smart
chipper
sippens
determined
to
wreak
a
kind
of
poetic
vengeance
on
his
enemy
the
south
side
gas
company
via
this
seemingly
remote
northside
conspiracy
in
ten
minutes
they
were
hand
in
glove
the
general
describing
to
sippens
the
penurious
and
unscrupulous
brand
of
councilman
duniway
politics
and
the
friendly
but
expensive
character
of
jacob
gerecht
such
is
life
in
the
organization
of
the
hyde
park
company
cowperwood
because
he
never
cared
to
put
all
his
eggs
in
one
basket
decided
to
secure
a
second
lawyer
and
a
second
dummy
president
although
he
proposed
to
keep
de
soto
sippens
as
general
practical
adviser
for
all
three
or
four
companies
he
was
thinking
this
matter
over
when
there
appeared
on
the
scene
a
very
much
younger
man
than
the
old
general
one
kent
barrows
mckibben
the
only
son
of
marshall
scammon
mckibben
of
the
state
supreme
court
kent
mckibben
was
years
old
tall
athletic
and
after
a
fashion
handsome
he
was
not
at
all
vague
intellectually
that
is
in
the
matter
of
the
conduct
of
his
business
but
dandified
and
at
times
remote
he
had
an
office
in
one
of
the
best
blocks
in
dearborn
street
which
he
reached
in
a
reserved
speculative
mood
every
morning
at
nine
unless
something
important
called
him
earlier
it
so
happened
that
he
had
drawn
up
the
deeds
and
agreements
for
the
company
that
sold
cowperwood
his
lots
at
street
and
michigan
avenue
and
when
they
were
ready
he
journeyed
to
the
latter
office
to
ask
if
there
were
any
additional
details
which
cowperwood
might
want
to
have
taken
into
consideration
when
he
was
ushered
in
cowperwood
turned
to
him
his
keen
analytical
eyes
and
saw
at
once
a
personality
he
liked
mckibben
was
just
remote
and
artistic
enough
to
suit
him
he
liked
his
clothes
his
agnostic
unreadableness
his
social
air
mckibben
on
his
part
caught
the
significance
of
the
superior
financial
atmosphere
at
once
he
noted
cowperwood
suit
picked
out
with
strands
of
red
his
maroon
tie
and
small
cameo
his
desk
looked
clean
and
official
the
woodwork
of
the
rooms
was
all
cherry
and
oiled
the
pictures
interesting
of
american
life
appropriately
framed
the
typewriter
at
that
time
just
introduced
was
in
evidence
and
the
also
new
was
ticking
volubly
the
prices
current
the
secretary
who
waited
on
cowperwood
was
a
young
polish
girl
named
antoinette
nowak
reserved
seemingly
astute
dark
and
very
attractive
what
sort
of
business
is
it
you
handle
mr
mckibben
asked
cowperwood
quite
casually
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
and
after
listening
to
mckibben
explanation
he
added
idly
you
might
come
and
see
me
some
time
next
week
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
have
something
in
your
line
in
another
man
mckibben
would
have
resented
this
remote
suggestion
of
future
aid
now
instead
he
was
intensely
pleased
the
man
before
him
gripped
his
imagination
his
remote
intellectuality
relaxed
when
he
came
again
and
cowperwood
indicated
the
nature
of
the
work
he
might
wish
to
have
done
mckibben
rose
to
the
bait
like
a
fish
to
a
fly
i
wish
you
would
let
me
undertake
that
cowperwood
he
said
quite
eagerly
it
something
i
never
done
but
i
satisfied
i
can
do
it
i
live
out
in
hyde
park
and
know
most
of
the
councilmen
i
can
bring
considerable
influence
to
bear
for
you
cowperwood
smiled
pleasantly
so
a
second
company
officered
by
dummies
of
mckibben
selection
was
organized
de
soto
sippens
without
old
general
van
knowledge
was
taken
in
as
practical
adviser
an
application
for
a
franchise
was
drawn
up
and
kent
barrows
mckibben
began
silent
polite
work
on
the
south
side
coming
into
the
confidence
by
degrees
of
the
various
councilmen
there
was
still
a
third
lawyer
burton
stimson
the
youngest
but
assuredly
not
the
least
able
of
the
three
a
pale
romeoish
youth
with
burning
eyes
whom
cowperwood
had
encountered
doing
some
little
work
for
laughlin
and
who
was
engaged
to
work
on
the
west
side
with
old
laughlin
as
ostensible
organizer
and
the
sprightly
de
soto
sippens
as
practical
adviser
stimson
was
no
mooning
romeo
however
but
an
eager
incisive
soul
born
very
poor
eager
to
advance
himself
cowperwood
detected
that
pliability
of
intellect
which
while
it
might
spell
disaster
to
some
spelled
success
for
him
he
wanted
the
intellectual
servants
he
was
willing
to
pay
them
handsomely
to
keep
them
busy
to
treat
them
with
almost
princely
courtesy
but
he
must
have
the
utmost
loyalty
stimson
while
maintaining
his
calm
and
reserve
could
have
kissed
the
hand
such
is
the
subtlety
of
contact
behold
then
at
once
on
the
north
side
the
south
side
the
west
side
dark
goings
to
and
fro
and
walkings
up
and
down
in

earth
in

old

conferring
with

with

both
of
whom
were
agreeable

tabulated

the
city
gas

being
divided
into
three
factions
were
in
no
way
prepared
for
what
was
now
coming
when
the
news
finally
leaked
out
that
applications
for
franchises
had
been
made
to
the
several
corporate
village
bodies
each
old
company
suspected

were
sent
one
by

company
to
the

in

involved
but
no
one
of
the
companies
had
as
yet
the
slightest
idea
who
was
back
of
it
all
or
of
the
general
plan
of
operations
before
any
one
of
them
could
reasonably
protest
before
it
could
decide
that
it
was
willing
to
pay
a
very
great
deal
to
have
the
suburb
adjacent
to
its
particular
territory
left
free
before
it
could
organize
a
legal
fight
councilmanic
ordinances
were
introduced
giving
the
applying

what
it
sought
and
after
a
single
reading
in
each
case
and
one
open
hearing
as
the
law
compelled
they
were
almost
unanimously
passed
there
were
loud
cries
of
dismay
from
minor
suburban
papers
which
had
almost
been
forgotten
in
the
arrangement
of
rewards
the
large
city
newspapers
cared
little
at
first
seeing
these
were
outlying
districts
they
merely
made
the
comment
that
the
villages
were
beginning
well
following
in
the
steps
of
the
city
council
in
its
distinguished
career
of
crime
cowperwood
smiled
as
he
saw
in
the
morning
papers
the
announcement
of
the
passage
of
each
ordinance
granting
him
a
franchise
he
listened
with
comfort
thereafter
on
many
a
day
to
accounts
by
laughlin
sippens
mckibben
and
van
sickle
of
overtures
made
to
buy
them
out
or
to
take
over
their
franchises
he
worked
on
plans
with
sippens
looking
to
the
actual
introduction
of
there
were
bond
issues
now
to
float
stock
to
be
marketed
contracts
for
supplies
to
be
awarded
actual
reservoirs
and
tanks
to
be
built
and
pipes
to
be
laid
a
public
opposition
had
to
be
smoothed
over
in
all
this
de
soto
sippens
proved
a
trump
with
van
sickle
mckibben
and
stimson
as
his
advisers
in
different
sections
of
the
city
he
would
present
tabloid
propositions
to
cowperwood
to
which
the
latter
had
merely
to
bow
his
head
in
assent
or
say
no
then
de
soto
would
buy
build
and
excavate
cowperwood
was
so
pleased
that
he
was
determined
to
keep
de
soto
with
him
permanently
de
soto
was
pleased
to
think
that
he
was
being
given
a
chance
to
pay
up
old
scores
and
to
do
large
things
he
was
really
grateful
we
not
through
with
those
sharpers
he
declared
to
cowperwood
triumphantly
one
day
they
fight
us
with
suits
they
may
join
hands
later
they
blew
up
my
they
may
blow
up
ours
let
them
blow
said
cowperwood
we
can
blow
too
and
sue
also
i
like
lawsuits
we
tie
them
up
so
that
they
beg

quarter
his
eyes
twinkled
cheerfully
chapter
ix
in
search
of
victory
in
the
mean
time
the
social
affairs
of
aileen
had
been
prospering
in
a
small
way
for
while
it
was
plain
that
they
were
not
to
be
taken
up
at
once
that
was
not
to
be
expected
it
was
also
plain
that
they
were
not
to
be
ignored
entirely
one
thing
that
helped
in
providing
a
nice
harmonious
working
atmosphere
was
the
obvious
warm
affection
of
cowperwood
for
his
wife
while
many
might
consider
aileen
a
little
brash
or
crude
still
in
the
hands
of
so
strong
and
capable
a
man
as
cowperwood
she
might
prove
available
so
thought
addison
for
instance
and
rambaud
mckibben
and
lord
felt
the
same
way
if
cowperwood
loved
her
as
he
seemed
to
do
he
would
probably
put
her
through
successfully
and
he
really
did
love
her
after
his
fashion
he
could
never
forget
how
splendid
she
had
been
to
him
in
those
old
days
when
knowing
full
well
the
circumstances
of
his
home
his
wife
his
children
the
probable
opposition
of
her
own
family
she
had
thrown
over
convention
and
sought
his
love
how
freely
she
had
given
of
hers
no
petty
squeamish
bickering
and
dickering
here
he
had
been
her
frank
from
the
start
and
he
still
felt
keenly
that
longing
in
her
to
be
with
him
to
be
his
which
had
produced
those
first
wonderful
almost
terrible
days
she
might
quarrel
fret
fuss
argue
suspect
and
accuse
him
of
flirtation
with
other
women
but
slight
variations
from
the
norm
in
his
case
did
not
trouble
her
at
least
she
argued
that
they
would
she
had
never
had
any
evidence
she
was
ready
to
forgive
him
anything
she
said
and
she
was
too
if
only
he
would
love
her
you
devil
she
used
to
say
to
him
playfully
i
know
you
i
can
see
you
looking
around
that
a
nice
stenographer
you
have
in
the
office
i
suppose
it
her
do
be
silly
aileen
he
would
reply
do
be
coarse
you
know
i
would
take
up
with
a
stenographer
an
office
is
the
place
for
that
sort
of
thing
oh
is
it
do
silly
me
i
know
you
any
old
place
is
good
enough
for
you
he
laughed
and
so
did
she
she
could
not
help
it
she
loved
him
so
there
was
no
particular
bitterness
in
her
assaults
she
loved
him
and
very
often
he
would
take
her
in
his
arms
kiss
her
tenderly
and
coo
are
you
my
fine
big
baby
are
you
my
doll
do
you
really
love
me
so
much
kiss
me
then
frankly
pagan
passion
in
these
two
ran
high
so
long
as
they
were
not
alienated
by
extraneous
things
he
could
never
hope
for
more
delicious
human
contact
there
was
no
reaction
either
to
speak
of
no
gloomy
disgust
she
was
physically
acceptable
to
him
he
could
always
talk
to
her
in
a
genial
teasing
way
even
tender
for
she
did
not
offend
his
intellectuality
with
prudish
or
conventional
notions
loving
and
foolish
as
she
was
in
some
ways
she
would
stand
blunt
reproof
or
correction
she
could
suggest
in
a
nebulous
blundering
way
things
that
would
be
good
for
them
to
do
most
of
all
at
present
their
thoughts
centered
upon
chicago
society
the
new
house
which
by
now
had
been
contracted
for
and
what
it
would
do
to
facilitate
their
introduction
and
standing
never
did
a
life
look
more
rosy
aileen
thought
it
was
almost
too
good
to
be
true
her
frank
was
so
handsome
so
loving
so
generous
there
was
not
a
small
idea
about
him
what
if
he
did
stray
from
her
at
times
he
remained
faithful
to
her
spiritually
and
she
knew
as
yet
of
no
single
instance
in
which
he
had
failed
her
she
little
knew
as
much
as
she
knew
how
blandly
he
could
lie
and
protest
in
these
matters
but
he
was
fond
of
her
just
the
same
and
he
really
had
not
strayed
to
any
extent
by
now
also
cowperwood
had
invested
about
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
his
speculations
and
he
was
jubilant
over
his
prospects
the
franchises
were
good
for
twenty
years
by
that
time
he
would
be
nearly
sixty
and
he
would
probably
have
bought
combined
with
or
sold
out
to
the
older
companies
at
a
great
profit
the
future
of
chicago
was
all
in
his
favor
he
decided
to
invest
as
much
as
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
pictures
if
he
could
find
the
right
ones
and
to
have
aileen
portrait
painted
while
she
was
still
so
beautiful
this
matter
of
art
was
again
beginning
to
interest
him
immensely
addison
had
four
or
five
good
pictures
a
rousseau
a
greuze
a
wouverman
and
one
lawrence
picked
up
heaven
knows
where
a
by
the
name
of
collard
a
and
merchant
was
said
to
have
a
very
striking
collection
addison
had
told
him
of
one
davis
trask
a
hardware
prince
who
was
now
collecting
there
were
many
homes
he
knew
where
art
was
beginning
to
be
assembled
he
must
begin
too
cowperwood
once
the
franchises
had
been
secured
had
installed
sippens
in
his
own
office
giving
him
charge
for
the
time
being
small
rented
offices
and
clerks
were
maintained
in
the
region
where
practical
was
going
on
all
sorts
of
suits
to
enjoin
annul
and
restrain
had
been
begun
by
the
various
old
companies
but
mckibben
stimson
and
old
general
van
sickle
were
fighting
these
with
trojan
vigor
and
complacency
it
was
a
pleasant
scene
still
no
one
knew
very
much
of
cowperwood
entrance
into
chicago
as
yet
he
was
a
very
minor
figure
his
name
had
not
even
appeared
in
connection
with
this
work
other
men
were
being
celebrated
daily
a
little
to
his
envy
when
would
he
begin
to
shine
soon
now
surely
so
off
they
went
in
june
comfortable
rich
gay
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
intent
upon
enjoying
to
the
full
their
first
holiday
abroad
it
was
a
wonderful
trip
addison
was
good
enough
to
telegraph
flowers
to
new
york
for
cowperwood
to
be
delivered
on
shipboard
mckibben
sent
books
of
travel
cowperwood
uncertain
whether
anybody
would
send
flowers
ordered
them
himself
two
amazing
baskets
which
with
addison
made
three
and
these
with
attached
cards
awaited
them
in
the
lobby
of
the
main
deck
several
at
the
captain
table
took
pains
to
seek
out
the
cowperwoods
they
were
invited
to
join
several
and
to
attend
informal
concerts
it
was
a
rough
passage
however
and
aileen
was
sick
it
was
hard
to
make
herself
look
just
nice
enough
and
so
she
kept
to
her
room
she
was
very
haughty
distant
to
all
but
a
few
and
to
these
careful
of
her
conversation
she
felt
herself
coming
to
be
a
very
important
person
before
leaving
she
had
almost
exhausted
the
resources
of
the
donovan
establishment
in
chicago
lingerie
boudoir
costumes
she
possessed
in
plenty
she
had
a
hidden
away
about
her
person
containing
all
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewels
her
shoes
stockings
hats
and
accessories
in
general
were
innumerable
because
of
all
this
cowperwood
was
rather
proud
of
her
she
had
such
a
capacity
for
life
his
first
wife
had
been
pale
and
rather
anemic
while
aileen
was
fairly
bursting
with
sheer
physical
vitality
she
hummed
and
jested
and
primped
and
posed
there
are
some
souls
that
just
are
without
previous
revision
or
introspection
the
earth
with
all
its
long
past
was
a
mere
suggestion
to
aileen
dimly
visualized
if
at
all
she
may
have
heard
that
there
were
once
dinosaurs
and
flying
reptiles
but
if
so
it
made
no
deep
impression
on
her
somebody
had
said
or
was
saying
that
we
were
descended
from
monkeys
which
was
quite
absurd
though
it
might
be
true
enough
on
the
sea
the
thrashing
hills
of
green
water
suggested
a
kind
of
immensity
and
terror
but
not
the
immensity
of
the
poet
heart
the
ship
was
safe
the
captain
at
table
in
brass
buttons
and
blue
uniform
eager
to
be
nice
to
her
told
her
so
her
faith
really
was
in
the
captain
and
there
with
her
always
was
cowperwood
looking
at
this
whole
moving
spectacle
of
life
with
a
suspicious
not
apprehensive
but
wary
eye
and
saying
nothing
about
it
in
london
letters
given
them
by
addison
brought
several
invitations
to
the
opera
to
dinner
to
goodwood
for
a
weekend
and
so
on
carriages
tallyhoes
cabs
for
riding
were
invoked
a
invitation
to
a
houseboat
on
the
thames
was
secured
their
english
hosts
looking
on
all
this
as
a
financial
adventure
good
financial
wisdom
were
courteous
and
civil
nothing
more
aileen
was
intensely
curious
she
noted
servants
manners
forms
immediately
she
began
to
think
that
america
was
not
good
enough
perhaps
it
wanted
so
many
things
now
aileen
you
and
i
have
to
live
in
chicago
for
years
and
years
commented
cowperwood
do
get
wild
these
people
do
care
for
americans
ca
you
see
that
they
would
accept
us
if
we
were
over
here
not
yet
anyhow
we
merely
passing
strangers
being
courteously
entertained
cowperwood
saw
it
all
aileen
was
being
spoiled
in
a
way
but
there
was
no
help
she
dressed
and
dressed
the
englishmen
used
to
look
at
her
in
hyde
park
where
she
rode
and
drove
at
claridges
where
they
stayed
in
bond
street
where
she
shopped
the
englishwomen
the
majority
of
them
remote
simple
in
their
tastes
lifted
their
eyes
cowperwood
sensed
the
situation
but
said
nothing
he
loved
aileen
and
she
was
satisfactory
to
him
at
least
for
the
present
anyhow
beautiful
if
he
could
adjust
her
station
in
chicago
that
would
be
sufficient
for
a
beginning
after
three
weeks
of
very
active
life
during
which
aileen
patronized
the
ancient
and
honorable
glories
of
england
they
went
on
to
paris
here
she
was
quickened
to
a
enthusiasm
you
know
she
said
to
cowperwood
quite
solemnly
the
second
morning
the
english
do
know
how
to
dress
i
thought
they
did
but
the
smartest
of
them
copy
the
french
take
those
men
we
saw
last
night
in
the
cafe
there
was
an
englishman
i
saw
that
compared
with
them
my
dear
your
tastes
are
exotic
replied
cowperwood
who
was
watching
her
with
pleased
interest
while
he
adjusted
his
tie
the
french
smart
crowd
are
almost
too
smart
dandified
i
think
some
of
those
young
fellows
had
on
corsets
what
of
it
replied
aileen
i
like
it
if
you
going
to
be
smart
why
not
be
very
smart
i
know
that
your
theory
my
dear
he
said
but
it
can
be
overdone
there
is
such
a
thing
as
going
too
far
you
have
to
compromise
even
if
you
do
look
as
well
as
you
might
you
ca
be
too
very
conspicuously
different
from
your
neighbors
even
in
the
right
direction
you
know
she
said
stopping
and
looking
at
him
i
believe
going
to
get
very
conservative
some
day
like
my
brothers
she
came
over
and
touched
his
tie
and
smoothed
his
hair
well
one
of
us
ought
to
be
for
the
good
of
the
family
he
commented
half
smiling
i
not
so
sure
though
that
it
will
be
you
either
it
a
charming
day
see
how
nice
those
statues
look
shall
we
go
to
the
cluny
or
versailles
or
fontainbleau
we
ought
to
see
bernhardt
at
the
francaise
aileen
was
so
gay
it
was
so
splendid
to
be
traveling
with
her
true
husband
at
last
it
was
on
this
trip
that
cowperwood
taste
for
art
and
life
and
his
determination
to
possess
them
revived
to
the
fullest
he
made
the
acquaintance
in
london
paris
and
brussels
of
the
important
art
dealers
his
conception
of
great
masters
and
the
older
schools
of
art
shaped
themselves
by
one
of
the
dealers
in
london
who
at
once
recognized
in
him
a
possible
future
patron
he
was
invited
with
aileen
to
view
certain
private
collections
and
here
and
there
was
an
artist
such
as
lord
leighton
dante
gabriel
rossetti
or
whistler
to
whom
he
was
introduced
casually
an
interested
stranger
these
men
only
saw
a
strong
polite
remote
conservative
man
he
realized
the
emotional
egotistic
and
artistic
soul
he
felt
on
the
instant
that
there
could
be
little
in
common
between
such
men
and
himself
in
so
far
as
personal
contact
was
concerned
yet
there
was
mutual
ground
on
which
they
could
meet
he
could
not
be
a
slavish
admirer
of
anything
only
a
princely
patron
so
he
walked
and
saw
wondering
how
soon
his
dreams
of
grandeur
were
to
be
realized
in
london
he
bought
a
portrait
by
raeburn
in
paris
a
plowing
scene
by
millet
a
small
jan
steen
a
battle
piece
by
meissonier
and
a
romantic
courtyard
scene
by
isabey
thus
began
the
revival
of
his
former
interest
in
art
the
nucleus
of
that
future
collection
which
was
to
mean
so
much
to
him
in
later
years
on
their
return
the
building
of
the
new
chicago
mansion
created
the
next
interesting
diversion
in
the
lives
of
aileen
and
cowperwood
because
of
some
chateaux
they
saw
in
france
that
form
or
rather
a
modification
of
it
as
suggested
by
taylor
lord
was
adopted
lord
figured
that
it
would
take
all
of
a
year
perhaps
a
year
and
a
half
to
deliver
it
in
perfect
order
but
time
was
of
no
great
importance
in
this
connection
in
the
mean
while
they
could
strengthen
their
social
connections
and
prepare
for
that
interesting
day
when
they
should
be
of
the
chicago
elite
there
were
at
this
time
several
elements
in
chicago
those
who
having
grown
suddenly
rich
from
dull
poverty
could
not
so
easily
forget
the
village
church
and
the
village
social
standards
those
who
having
inherited
wealth
or
migrated
from
the
east
where
wealth
was
old
understood
more
of
the
savoir
faire
of
the
game
and
those
who
being
newly
born
into
wealth
and
seeing
the
drift
toward
a
smarter
american
life
were
beginning
to
wish
they
might
shine
in
it
these
last
the
very
young
people
the
latter
were
just
beginning
to
dream
of
dances
at
kinsley
a
stated
kirmess
and
summer
diversions
of
the
european
kind
but
they
had
not
arrived
as
yet
the
first
class
although
by
far
the
dullest
and
most
bovine
was
still
the
most
powerful
because
they
were
the
richest
money
as
yet
providing
the
highest
standard
the
functions
which
these
people
provided
were
stupid
to
the
verge
of
distraction
really
they
were
only
the
receptions
and
calls
of
squeedunk
and
hohokus
raised
to
the
nth
power
the
purpose
of
the
whole
matter
was
to
see
and
be
seen
novelty
in
either
thought
or
action
was
decidedly
eschewed
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
customariness
of
thought
and
action
and
the
quintessence
of
convention
that
was
desired
the
idea
of
introducing
a
play
actress
for
instance
as
was
done
occasionally
in
the
east
or
in
london
never
even
a
singer
or
an
artist
was
eyed
askance
one
could
easily
go
too
far
but
if
a
european
prince
should
have
strayed
to
chicago
which
he
never
did
or
if
an
eastern
social
magnate
chanced
to
stay
over
a
train
or
two
then
the
topmost
circle
of
local
wealth
was
prepared
to
strain
itself
to
the
cowperwood
had
sensed
all
this
on
his
arrival
but
he
fancied
that
if
he
became
rich
and
powerful
enough
he
and
aileen
with
their
fine
house
to
help
them
might
well
be
the
leaven
which
would
lighten
the
whole
lump
unfortunately
aileen
was
too
obviously
on
the
qui
vive
for
those
opportunities
which
might
lead
to
social
recognition
and
equality
if
not
supremacy
like
the
savage
unorganized
for
protection
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
horrific
caprice
of
nature
she
was
almost
tremulous
at
times
with
thoughts
of
possible
failure
almost
at
once
she
had
recognized
herself
as
unsuited
temperamentally
for
association
with
certain
types
of
society
women
the
wife
of
anson
merrill
the
great
prince
whom
she
saw
in
one
of
the
stores
one
day
impressed
her
as
much
too
cold
and
remote
merrill
was
a
woman
of
superior
mood
and
education
who
found
herself
in
her
own
estimation
hard
put
to
it
for
suitable
companionship
in
chicago
she
was
and
familiar
in
an
offhand
way
with
the
superior
world
of
london
which
she
had
visited
several
times
chicago
at
its
best
was
to
her
a
sordid
commercial
mess
she
preferred
new
york
or
washington
but
she
had
to
live
here
thus
she
patronized
nearly
all
of
those
with
whom
she
condescended
to
associate
using
an
upward
tilt
of
the
head
a
tired
droop
of
the
eyelids
and
a
fine
upward
arching
of
the
brows
to
indicate
how
trite
it
all
was
it
was
a
henry
huddlestone
who
had
pointed
out
merrill
to
aileen
huddlestone
was
the
wife
of
a
soap
manufacturer
living
very
close
to
the
cowperwoods
temporary
home
and
she
and
her
husband
were
on
the
outer
fringe
of
society
she
had
heard
that
the
cowperwoods
were
people
of
wealth
that
they
were
friendly
with
the
addisons
and
that
they
were
going
to
build
a
mansion
the
value
of
houses
always
grows
in
the
telling
that
was
enough
she
had
called
being
three
doors
away
to
leave
her
card
and
aileen
willing
to
curry
favor
here
and
there
had
responded
huddlestone
was
a
little
woman
not
very
attractive
in
appearance
clever
in
a
social
way
and
eminently
practical
speaking
of
merrill
commented
huddlestone
on
this
particular
day
there
she
is
near
the
counter
she
always
carries
that
lorgnette
in
just
that
way
aileen
turned
and
examined
critically
a
tall
dark
slender
woman
of
the
high
world
of
the
west
very
remote
disdainful
superior
you
do
know
her
questioned
aileen
curiously
surveying
her
at
leisure
no
replied
huddlestone
defensively
they
live
on
the
north
side
and
the
different
sets
do
mingle
so
much
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
just
the
glory
of
the
principal
families
that
they
were
above
this
arbitrary
division
of
sides
and
could
pick
their
associates
from
all
three
divisions
oh
observed
aileen
nonchalantly
she
was
secretly
irritated
to
think
that
huddlestone
should
find
it
necessary
to
point
out
merrill
to
her
as
a
superior
person
you
know
she
darkens
her
eyebrows
a
little
i
think
suggested
huddlestone
studying
her
enviously
her
husband
they
say
is
the
most
faithful
person
in
the
world
there
another
woman
a
gladdens
that
lives
very
close
to
them
that
he
very
much
interested
in
oh
said
aileen
cautiously
after
her
own
philadelphia
experience
she
had
decided
to
be
on
her
guard
and
not
indulge
in
too
much
gossip
arrows
of
this
particular
kind
could
so
readily
fly
in
her
direction
but
her
set
is
really
much
the
smartest
complimented
companion
thereafter
it
was
aileen
ambition
to
associate
with
anson
merrill
to
be
fully
and
freely
accepted
by
her
she
did
not
know
although
she
might
have
feared
that
that
ambition
was
never
to
be
realized
but
there
were
others
who
had
called
at
the
first
cowperwood
home
or
with
whom
the
cowperwoods
managed
to
form
an
acquaintance
there
were
the
sunderland
sledds
sledd
being
general
traffic
manager
of
one
of
the
southwestern
railways
entering
the
city
and
a
gentleman
of
taste
and
culture
and
some
wealth
his
wife
an
ambitious
nobody
there
were
the
walter
rysam
cottons
cotton
being
a
wholesale
but
more
especially
a
local
social
litterateur
his
wife
a
graduate
of
vassar
there
were
the
norrie
simmses
simms
being
secretary
and
treasurer
of
the
douglas
trust
and
savings
company
and
a
power
in
another
group
of
financial
people
a
group
entirely
distinct
from
that
represented
by
addison
and
rambaud
others
included
the
stanislau
hoecksemas
wealthy
furriers
the
duane
kingslands
wholesale
flour
the
webster
israelses
packers
the
bradford
candas
jewelers
all
these
people
amounted
to
something
socially
they
all
had
substantial
homes
and
substantial
incomes
so
that
they
were
worthy
of
consideration
the
difference
between
aileen
and
most
of
the
women
involved
a
difference
between
naturalism
and
illusion
but
this
calls
for
some
explanation
to
really
know
the
state
of
the
feminine
mind
at
this
time
one
would
have
to
go
back
to
that
period
in
the
middle
ages
when
the
church
flourished
and
the
industrious
poet
half
schooled
in
the
facts
of
life
surrounded
women
with
a
mystical
halo
since
that
day
the
maiden
and
the
matron
as
well
has
been
schooled
to
believe
that
she
is
of
a
finer
clay
than
man
that
she
was
born
to
uplift
him
and
that
her
favors
are
priceless
this
mist
of
romance
having
nothing
to
do
with
personal
morality
has
brought
about
nevertheless
a
attitude
of
women
toward
men
and
even
of
women
toward
women
now
the
chicago
atmosphere
in
which
aileen
found
herself
was
composed
in
part
of
this
very
illusion
the
ladies
to
whom
she
had
been
introduced
were
of
this
high
world
of
fancy
they
conceived
themselves
to
be
perfect
even
as
they
were
represented
in
religious
art
and
in
fiction
their
husbands
must
be
models
worthy
of
their
high
ideals
and
other
women
must
have
no
blemish
of
any
kind
aileen
urgent
elemental
would
have
laughed
at
all
this
if
she
could
have
understood
not
understanding
she
felt
diffident
and
uncertain
of
herself
in
certain
presences
instance
in
this
connection
norrie
simms
who
was
a
satellite
of
anson
merrill
to
be
invited
to
the
anson
merrills
for
tea
dinner
luncheon
or
to
be
driven
by
merrill
was
paradise
to
simms
she
loved
to
recite
the
bon
mots
of
her
idol
to
discourse
upon
her
astonishing
degree
of
culture
to
narrate
how
people
refused
on
occasion
to
believe
that
she
was
the
wife
of
anson
merrill
even
though
she
herself
declared
it
those
old
chestnuts
of
the
social
world
which
must
have
had
their
origin
in
egypt
and
chaldea
simms
herself
was
of
a
nondescript
type
not
a
real
personage
clever
tasteful
a
social
climber
the
two
simms
children
little
girls
had
been
taught
all
the
social
graces
of
the
day
to
pose
smirk
genuflect
and
the
like
to
the
immense
delight
of
their
elders
the
nurse
in
charge
was
in
uniform
the
governess
was
a
much
person
simms
had
a
high
manner
eyes
for
those
above
her
only
a
serene
contempt
for
the
commonplace
world
in
which
she
had
to
dwell
during
the
first
dinner
at
which
she
entertained
the
cowperwoods
simms
attempted
to
dig
into
aileen
philadelphia
history
asking
if
she
knew
the
arthur
leighs
the
trevor
drakes
roberta
willing
or
the
martyn
walkers
simms
did
not
know
them
herself
but
she
had
heard
merrill
speak
of
them
and
that
was
enough
of
a
handle
whereby
to
swing
them
aileen
quick
on
the
defense
ready
to
lie
manfully
on
her
own
behalf
assured
her
that
she
had
known
them
as
indeed
she
had
very
casually
and
before
the
rumor
which
connected
her
with
cowperwood
had
been
voiced
abroad
this
pleased
simms
i
must
tell
nellie
she
said
referring
thus
familiarly
to
merrill
aileen
feared
that
if
this
sort
of
thing
continued
it
would
soon
be
all
over
town
that
she
had
been
a
mistress
before
she
had
been
a
wife
that
she
had
been
the
unmentioned
corespondent
in
the
divorce
suit
and
that
cowperwood
had
been
in
prison
only
his
wealth
and
her
beauty
could
save
her
and
would
they
one
night
they
had
been
to
dinner
at
the
duane
kingslands
and
bradford
canda
had
asked
her
in
what
seemed
a
very
significant
way
whether
she
had
ever
met
her
friend
schuyler
evans
of
philadelphia
this
frightened
aileen
do
you
suppose
they
must
know
some
of
them
about
us
she
asked
cowperwood
on
the
way
home
i
suppose
so
he
replied
thoughtfully
i
sure
i
do
know
i
would
worry
about
that
if
i
were
you
if
you
worry
about
it
suggest
it
to
them
i
have
made
any
secret
of
my
term
in
prison
in
philadelphia
and
i
do
intend
to
it
was
a
square
deal
and
they
had
no
right
to
put
me
there
i
know
dear
replied
aileen
it
might
not
make
so
much
difference
if
they
did
know
i
do
see
why
it
should
we
are
not
the
only
ones
that
have
had
marriage
troubles
i
sure
there
just
one
thing
about
this
either
they
accept
us
or
they
do
if
they
do
well
and
good
we
ca
help
it
we
go
on
and
finish
the
house
and
give
them
a
chance
to
be
decent
if
they
wo
be
there
are
other
cities
money
will
arrange
matters
in
new
york
that
i
know
we
can
build
a
real
place
there
and
go
in
on
equal
terms
if
we
have
money
enough
and
i
will
have
money
enough
he
added
after
a
moment
pondering
never
fear
i
make
millions
here
whether
they
want
me
to
or
not
and
after
that
well
after
that
see
what
we
see
do
worry
i
have
seen
many
troubles
in
this
world
that
money
would
cure
his
teeth
had
that
even
set
that
they
always
assumed
when
he
was
dangerously
in
earnest
he
took
aileen
hand
however
and
pressed
it
gently
do
worry
he
repeated
chicago
is
the
only
city
and
we
be
the
poorest
people
in
america
either
in
ten
years
just
keep
up
your
courage
it
will
all
come
out
right
it
certain
to
aileen
looked
out
on
the
length
of
michigan
avenue
down
which
they
were
rolling
past
many
silent
mansions
the
tops
of
all
the
lamps
were
white
and
gleamed
through
the
shadows
receding
to
a
thin
point
it
was
dark
but
fresh
and
pleasant
oh
if
only
frank
money
could
buy
them
position
and
friendship
in
this
interesting
world
if
it
only
would
she
did
not
quite
realize
how
much
on
her
own
personality
or
the
lack
of
it
this
struggle
depended
chapter
x
a
test
the
opening
of
the
house
in
michigan
avenue
occurred
late
in
november
in
the
fall
of
eighteen
when
aileen
and
cowperwood
had
been
in
chicago
about
two
years
altogether
between
people
whom
they
had
met
at
the
races
at
various
dinners
and
teas
and
at
receptions
of
the
union
and
calumet
clubs
to
which
cowperwood
through
backing
had
been
admitted
and
those
whom
mckibben
and
lord
influenced
they
were
able
to
send
invitations
to
about
three
hundred
of
whom
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
responded
up
to
this
time
owing
to
cowperwood
quiet
manipulation
of
his
affairs
there
had
been
no
comment
on
his
past
no
particular
interest
in
it
he
had
money
affable
ways
a
magnetic
personality
the
business
men
of
the
city
those
whom
he
met
socially
were
inclined
to
consider
him
fascinating
and
very
clever
aileen
being
beautiful
and
graceful
for
attention
was
accepted
at
more
or
less
her
own
value
though
the
kingly
high
world
knew
them
not
it
is
amazing
what
a
showing
the
socially
unplaced
can
make
on
occasion
where
tact
and
discrimination
are
used
there
was
a
weekly
social
paper
published
in
chicago
at
this
time
a
rather
able
publication
as
such
things
go
which
cowperwood
with
mckibben
assistance
had
pressed
into
service
not
much
can
be
done
under
any
circumstances
where
the
cause
is
not
essentially
strong
but
where
as
in
this
case
there
is
a
semblance
of
respectability
considerable
wealth
and
great
force
and
magnetism
all
things
are
possible
kent
mckibben
knew
horton
biggers
the
editor
who
was
a
rather
desolate
and
disillusioned
person
of
gray
and
a
sort
of
human
sponge
or
barnacle
who
was
only
galvanized
into
seeming
interest
and
cheerfulness
by
sheer
necessity
those
were
the
days
when
the
society
editor
was
accepted
as
a
member
of
society
de
facto
and
treated
more
as
a
guest
than
a
reporter
though
even
then
the
tendency
was
toward
elimination
working
for
cowperwood
and
liking
him
mckibben
said
to
biggers
one
evening
you
know
the
cowperwoods
do
you
biggers
no
replied
the
latter
who
devoted
himself
to
the
more
exclusive
circles
who
are
they
why
he
a
banker
over
here
in
la
salle
street
they
from
philadelphia
cowperwood
a
beautiful
woman
young
and
all
that
they
building
a
house
out
here
on
michigan
avenue
you
ought
to
know
them
they
going
to
get
in
i
think
the
addisons
like
them
if
you
were
to
be
nice
to
them
now
i
think
they
appreciate
it
later
he
rather
liberal
and
a
good
fellow
biggers
pricked
up
his
ears
this
social
journalism
was
thin
picking
at
best
and
he
had
very
few
ways
of
turning
an
honest
penny
the
would
be
and
who
expected
nice
things
said
of
them
had
to
subscribe
and
rather
liberally
to
his
paper
not
long
after
this
brief
talk
cowperwood
received
a
subscription
blank
from
the
business
office
of
the
saturday
review
and
immediately
sent
a
check
for
one
hundred
dollars
to
horton
biggers
direct
subsequently
certain
not
very
significant
personages
noticed
that
when
the
cowperwoods
dined
at
their
boards
the
function
received
comment
by
the
saturday
review
not
otherwise
it
looked
as
though
the
cowperwoods
must
be
favored
but
who
were
they
anyhow
the
danger
of
publicity
and
even
moderate
social
success
is
that
scandal
loves
a
shining
mark
when
you
begin
to
stand
out
the
least
way
in
life
as
separate
from
the
mass
the
cognoscenti
wish
to
know
who
what
and
why
the
enthusiasm
of
aileen
combined
with
the
genius
of
cowperwood
was
for
making
their
opening
entertainment
a
very
exceptional
affair
which
under
the
circumstances
and
all
things
considered
was
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
as
yet
chicago
was
exceedingly
slow
socially
its
movements
were
as
has
been
said
more
or
less
bovine
and
phlegmatic
to
rush
in
with
something
utterly
brilliant
and
pyrotechnic
was
to
take
notable
chances
the
more
cautious
members
of
chicago
society
even
if
they
did
not
attend
would
hear
and
then
would
come
ultimate
comment
and
decision
the
function
began
with
a
reception
at
four
which
lasted
until
and
this
was
followed
by
a
dance
at
nine
with
music
by
a
famous
stringed
orchestra
of
chicago
a
musical
programme
by
artists
of
considerable
importance
and
a
gorgeous
supper
from
eleven
until
one
in
a
chinese
fairyland
of
lights
at
small
tables
filling
three
of
the
rooms
as
an
added
fillip
to
the
occasion
cowperwood
had
hung
not
only
the
important
pictures
which
he
had
purchased
abroad
but
a
new
one
a
particularly
brilliant
gerome
then
in
the
heyday
of
his
exotic
popularity
a
picture
of
nude
odalisques
of
the
harem
idling
beside
the
highly
colored
stone
marquetry
of
an
oriental
bath
it
was
more
or
less
loose
art
for
chicago
shocking
to
the
uninitiated
though
harmless
enough
to
the
illuminati
but
it
gave
a
touch
of
color
to
the
which
the
latter
needed
there
was
also
newly
arrived
and
newly
hung
a
portrait
of
aileen
by
a
dutch
artist
jan
van
beers
whom
they
had
encountered
the
previous
summer
at
brussels
he
had
painted
aileen
in
nine
sittings
a
rather
brilliant
canvas
high
in
key
with
a
summery
world
behind
her
a
low
pool
the
red
corner
of
a
dutch
brick
palace
a
and
a
blue
sky
with
fleecy
clouds
aileen
was
seated
on
the
curved
arm
of
a
stone
bench
green
grass
at
her
feet
a
parasol
with
a
lacy
edge
held
idly
to
one
side
her
rounded
vigorous
figure
clad
in
the
latest
mode
of
paris
a
white
and
blue
with
a
straw
hat
airy
shading
her
lusty
animal
eyes
the
artist
had
caught
her
spirit
quite
accurately
the
dash
the
assumption
the
bravado
based
on
the
courage
of
inexperience
or
lack
of
true
subtlety
a
refreshing
thing
in
its
way
a
little
showy
as
everything
that
related
to
her
was
and
inclined
to
arouse
jealousy
in
those
not
so
liberally
endowed
by
life
but
fine
as
a
character
piece
in
the
warm
glow
of
the
guttered
she
looked
particularly
brilliant
here
pampered
idle
jaunty
the
pet
of
the
world
many
stopped
to
see
and
many
were
the
comments
private
and
otherwise
this
day
began
with
a
flurry
of
uncertainty
and
worried
anticipation
on
the
part
of
aileen
at
cowperwood
suggestion
she
had
employed
a
social
secretary
a
poor
hack
of
a
girl
who
had
sent
out
all
the
letters
tabulated
the
replies
run
errands
and
advised
on
one
detail
and
another
fadette
her
french
maid
was
in
the
throes
of
preparing
for
two
toilets
which
would
have
to
be
made
this
day
one
by
two
at
least
another
between
six
and
eight
her
mon
dieus
and
par
bleus
could
be
heard
continuously
as
she
hunted
for
some
article
of
dress
or
polished
an
ornament
buckle
or
pin
the
struggle
of
aileen
to
be
perfect
was
as
usual
severe
her
meditations
as
to
the
most
becoming
gown
to
wear
were
trying
her
portrait
was
on
the
east
wall
in
the
a
spur
to
emulation
she
felt
as
though
all
society
were
about
to
judge
her
theresa
donovan
the
local
dressmaker
had
given
some
advice
but
aileen
decided
on
a
heavy
brown
velvet
constructed
by
worth
of
paris
a
thing
of
varying
aspects
showing
her
neck
and
arms
to
perfection
and
composing
charmingly
with
her
flesh
and
hair
she
tried
amethyst
and
changed
to
topaz
she
stockinged
her
legs
in
brown
silk
and
her
feet
were
shod
in
brown
slippers
with
red
enamel
buttons
the
trouble
with
aileen
was
that
she
never
did
these
things
with
that
ease
which
is
a
sure
sign
of
the
socially
efficient
she
never
quite
so
much
dominated
a
situation
as
she
permitted
it
to
dominate
her
only
the
superior
ease
and
graciousness
of
cowperwood
carried
her
through
at
times
but
that
always
did
when
he
was
near
she
felt
quite
the
great
lady
suited
to
any
realm
when
she
was
alone
her
courage
great
as
it
was
often
trembled
in
the
balance
her
dangerous
past
was
never
quite
out
of
her
mind
at
four
kent
mckibben
smug
in
his
afternoon
frock
his
quick
receptive
eyes
approving
only
partially
of
all
this
show
and
effort
took
his
place
in
the
general
talking
to
taylor
lord
who
had
completed
his
last
observation
and
was
leaving
to
return
later
in
the
evening
if
these
two
had
been
closer
friends
quite
intimate
they
would
have
discussed
the
cowperwoods
social
prospects
but
as
it
was
they
confined
themselves
to
dull
conventionalities
at
this
moment
aileen
came
for
a
moment
radiant
kent
mckibben
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
more
beautiful
after
all
contrasted
with
some
of
the
stuffy
creatures
who
moved
about
in
society
shrewd
hard
bony
calculating
trading
on
their
assured
position
she
was
admirable
it
was
a
pity
she
did
not
have
more
poise
she
ought
to
be
a
little
harder
not
quite
so
genial
still
with
cowperwood
at
her
side
she
might
go
far
really
cowperwood
he
said
it
is
all
most
charming
i
was
just
telling
lord
here
that
i
consider
the
house
a
triumph
from
mckibben
who
was
in
society
and
with
lord
another
in
standing
by
this
was
like
wine
to
aileen
she
beamed
joyously
among
the
first
arrivals
were
webster
israels
bradford
canda
and
walter
rysam
cotton
who
were
to
assist
in
receiving
these
ladies
did
not
know
that
they
were
taking
their
future
reputations
for
sagacity
and
discrimination
in
their
hands
they
had
been
carried
away
by
the
show
of
luxury
of
aileen
the
growing
financial
repute
of
cowperwood
and
the
artistic
qualities
of
the
new
house
webster
israels
mouth
was
of
such
a
peculiar
shape
that
aileen
was
always
reminded
of
a
fish
but
she
was
not
utterly
homely
and
she
looked
brisk
and
attractive
bradford
canda
whose
old
rose
and
dress
made
up
in
part
for
an
amazing
angularity
but
who
was
charming
withal
was
the
soul
of
interest
for
she
believed
this
to
be
a
very
significant
affair
walter
rysam
cotton
a
younger
woman
than
either
of
the
others
had
the
polish
of
vassar
life
about
her
and
was
above
many
things
somehow
she
half
suspected
the
cowperwoods
might
not
do
but
they
were
making
strides
and
might
possibly
surpass
all
other
aspirants
it
behooved
her
to
be
pleasant
life
passes
from
individuality
and
separateness
at
times
to
a
sort
of
monticelliesque
mood
of
color
where
individuality
is
nothing
the
glittering
totality
all
the
new
house
with
its
charming
french
windows
on
the
ground
floor
its
heavy
bands
of
stone
flowers
and
florated
door
was
soon
crowded
with
a
moving
colorful
flow
of
people
many
whom
aileen
and
cowperwood
did
not
know
at
all
had
been
invited
by
mckibben
and
lord
they
came
and
were
now
introduced
the
adjacent
side
streets
and
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
house
were
crowded
with
champing
horses
and
smartly
veneered
carriages
all
with
whom
the
cowperwoods
had
been
the
least
intimate
came
early
and
finding
the
scene
colorful
and
interesting
they
remained
for
some
time
the
caterer
kinsley
had
supplied
a
small
army
of
trained
servants
who
were
posted
like
soldiers
and
carefully
supervised
by
the
cowperwood
butler
the
new
rich
with
a
pompeian
scheme
of
color
was
aglow
with
a
wealth
of
glass
and
an
artistic
arrangement
of
delicacies
the
afternoon
costumes
of
the
women
ranging
through
autumnal
grays
purples
browns
and
greens
blended
effectively
with
the
walls
of
the
the
deep
gray
and
gold
of
the
general
the
red
of
the
the
of
the
and
the
neutral
sepia
of
the
aileen
backed
by
the
courageous
presence
of
cowperwood
who
in
the
the
library
and
the
was
holding
a
private
levee
of
men
stood
up
in
her
vain
beauty
a
thing
to
see
almost
to
weep
over
embodying
the
vanity
of
all
seeming
things
the
mockery
of
having
and
yet
not
having
this
parading
throng
that
was
more
curious
than
interested
more
jealous
than
sympathetic
more
critical
than
kind
was
coming
almost
solely
to
observe
do
you
know
cowperwood
simms
remarked
lightly
your
house
reminds
me
of
an
art
exhibit
i
hardly
know
why
aileen
who
caught
the
implied
slur
had
no
clever
words
wherewith
to
reply
she
was
not
gifted
in
that
way
but
she
flared
with
resentment
do
you
think
so
she
replied
caustically
simms
not
all
dissatisfied
with
the
effect
she
had
produced
passed
on
with
a
gay
air
attended
by
a
young
artist
who
followed
amorously
in
her
train
aileen
saw
from
this
and
other
things
like
it
how
little
she
was
really
in
the
exclusive
set
did
not
take
either
her
or
cowperwood
seriously
as
yet
she
almost
hated
the
comparatively
dull
israels
who
had
been
standing
beside
her
at
the
time
and
who
had
heard
the
remark
and
yet
israels
was
much
better
than
nothing
simms
had
condescended
a
mild
how
do
to
the
latter
it
was
in
vain
that
the
addisons
sledds
kingslands
hoecksemas
and
others
made
their
appearance
aileen
was
not
reassured
however
after
dinner
the
younger
set
influenced
by
mckibben
came
to
dance
and
aileen
was
at
her
best
in
spite
of
her
doubts
she
was
gay
bold
attractive
kent
mckibben
a
past
master
in
the
mazes
and
mysteries
of
the
grand
march
had
the
pleasure
of
leading
her
in
that
airy
fairy
procession
followed
by
cowperwood
who
gave
his
arm
to
simms
aileen
in
white
satin
with
a
touch
of
silver
here
and
there
and
necklet
bracelet
and
of
diamonds
glittered
in
almost
an
exotic
way
she
was
positively
radiant
mckibben
almost
smitten
was
most
attentive
this
is
such
a
pleasure
he
whispered
intimately
you
are
very
beautiful
a
dream
you
would
find
me
a
very
substantial
one
returned
aileen
would
that
i
might
find
he
laughed
gaily
and
aileen
gathering
the
hidden
significance
showed
her
teeth
teasingly
simms
engrossed
by
cowperwood
could
not
hear
as
she
would
have
liked
after
the
march
aileen
surrounded
by
a
of
gay
rudely
thoughtless
young
bloods
escorted
them
all
to
see
her
portrait
the
conservative
commented
on
the
flow
of
wine
the
intensely
nude
gerome
at
one
end
of
the
gallery
and
the
sparkling
portrait
of
aileen
at
the
other
the
enthusiasm
of
some
of
the
young
men
for
her
company
rambaud
pleasant
and
kindly
remarked
to
her
husband
that
aileen
was
very
eager
for
life
she
thought
addison
astonished
at
the
material
flare
of
the
cowperwoods
quite
transcending
in
glitter
if
not
in
size
and
solidity
anything
she
and
addison
had
ever
achieved
remarked
to
her
husband
that
he
must
be
making
money
very
fast
the
man
a
born
financier
ella
addison
explained
sententiously
he
a
manipulator
and
he
sure
to
make
money
whether
they
can
get
into
society
i
do
know
he
could
if
he
were
alone
that
sure
she
beautiful
but
he
needs
another
kind
of
woman
i
afraid
almost
too
that
what
i
think
too
i
like
her
but
i
afraid
she
not
going
to
play
her
cards
right
it
too
bad
too
just
then
aileen
came
by
a
smiling
youth
on
either
side
her
own
face
glowing
with
a
warmth
of
joy
engendered
by
much
flattery
the
which
was
composed
of
the
music
and
drawing
rooms
thrown
into
one
was
now
the
objective
it
glittered
before
her
with
a
moving
throng
the
air
was
full
of
the
odor
of
flowers
and
the
sound
of
music
and
voices
cowperwood
observed
bradford
canda
to
horton
biggers
the
society
editor
is
one
of
the
prettiest
women
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
she
almost
too
pretty
how
do
you
think
she
taking
queried
the
cautious
biggers
charming
but
she
hardly
cold
enough
i
afraid
hardly
clever
enough
it
takes
a
more
serious
type
she
a
little
too
these
old
women
would
never
want
to
get
near
her
she
makes
them
look
too
old
she
do
better
if
she
were
not
so
young
and
so
pretty
that
what
i
think
exactly
said
biggers
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
think
so
at
all
he
had
no
power
of
drawing
any
such
accurate
conclusions
but
he
believed
it
now
because
bradford
canda
had
said
it
chapter
xi
the
fruits
of
daring
next
morning
over
the
breakfast
cups
at
the
norrie
simmses
and
elsewhere
the
import
of
the
cowperwoods
social
efforts
was
discussed
and
the
problem
of
their
eventual
acceptance
or
carefully
weighed
the
trouble
with
cowperwood
observed
simms
is
that
she
is
too
gauche
the
whole
thing
was
much
too
showy
the
idea
of
her
portrait
at
one
end
of
the
gallery
and
that
gerome
at
the
other
and
then
this
item
in
the
press
this
morning
why
you
really
think
they
were
in
society
simms
was
already
a
little
angry
at
having
let
herself
be
used
as
she
now
fancied
she
had
been
by
taylor
lord
and
kent
mckibben
both
friends
of
hers
what
did
you
think
of
the
crowd
asked
norrie
buttering
a
roll
why
it
was
representative
at
all
of
course
we
were
the
most
important
people
they
had
there
and
i
sorry
now
that
we
went
who
are
the
israelses
and
the
hoecksemas
anyhow
that
dreadful
woman
she
was
referring
to
mrs
hoecksema
i
never
listened
to
duller
remarks
in
my
life
i
was
talking
to
haguenin
of
the
press
in
the
afternoon
observed
norrie
he
says
that
cowperwood
failed
in
philadelphia
before
he
came
here
and
that
there
were
a
lot
of
lawsuits
did
you
ever
hear
that
no
but
she
says
she
knows
the
drakes
and
the
walkers
there
been
intending
to
ask
nellie
about
that
i
have
often
wondered
why
he
should
leave
philadelphia
if
he
was
getting
along
so
well
people
usually
do
that
simms
was
envious
already
of
the
financial
showing
cowperwood
was
making
in
chicago
besides
cowperwood
manner
bespoke
supreme
intelligence
and
courage
and
that
is
always
resented
by
all
save
the
suppliants
or
the
triumphant
masters
of
other
walks
in
life
simms
was
really
interested
at
last
to
know
something
more
about
cowperwood
something
definite
before
this
social
situation
had
time
to
adjust
itself
one
way
or
the
other
however
a
matter
arose
which
in
its
way
was
far
more
vital
though
aileen
might
not
have
thought
so
the
feeling
between
the
new
and
old
gas
companies
was
becoming
strained
the
stockholders
of
the
older
organization
were
getting
uneasy
they
were
eager
to
find
out
who
was
back
of
these
new
gas
companies
which
were
threatening
to
poach
on
their
exclusive
preserves
finally
one
of
the
lawyers
who
had
been
employed
by
the
north
chicago
gas
illuminating
company
to
fight
the
machinations
of
de
soto
sippens
and
old
general
van
sickle
finding
that
the
lake
view
council
had
finally
granted
the
franchise
to
the
new
company
and
that
the
appellate
court
was
about
to
sustain
it
hit
upon
the
idea
of
charging
conspiracy
and
wholesale
bribery
of
councilmen
considerable
evidence
had
accumulated
that
duniway
jacob
gerecht
and
others
on
the
north
side
had
been
influenced
by
cash
and
to
bring
legal
action
would
delay
final
approval
of
the
franchises
and
give
the
old
company
time
to
think
what
else
to
do
this
north
side
company
lawyer
a
man
by
the
name
of
parsons
had
been
following
up
the
movements
of
sippens
and
old
general
van
sickle
and
had
finally
concluded
that
they
were
mere
dummies
and
pawns
and
that
the
real
instigator
in
all
this
excitement
was
cowperwood
or
if
not
he
then
men
whom
he
represented
parsons
visited
cowperwood
office
one
day
in
order
to
see
him
getting
no
satisfaction
he
proceeded
to
look
up
his
record
and
connections
these
various
investigations
and
came
to
a
head
in
a
court
proceeding
filed
in
the
united
states
circuit
court
late
in
november
charging
frank
algernon
cowperwood
henry
de
soto
sippens
judson
van
sickle
and
others
with
conspiracy
this
again
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
suits
begun
by
the
west
and
south
side
companies
charging
the
same
thing
in
each
case
cowperwood
name
was
mentioned
as
the
secret
power
behind
the
new
companies
conspiring
to
force
the
old
companies
to
buy
him
out
his
philadelphia
history
was
published
but
only
in
part
a
highly
modified
account
he
had
furnished
the
newspapers
some
time
before
though
conspiracy
and
bribery
are
ugly
words
still
charges
prove
nothing
but
a
penitentiary
record
for
whatever
reason
served
coupled
with
previous
failure
divorce
and
scandal
though
the
newspapers
made
only
the
most
guarded
reference
to
all
this
served
to
whet
public
interest
and
to
fix
cowperwood
and
his
wife
in
the
public
eye
cowperwood
himself
was
solicited
for
an
interview
but
his
answer
was
that
he
was
merely
a
financial
agent
for
the
three
new
companies
not
an
investor
and
that
the
charges
in
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
were
untrue
mere
legal
trumped
up
to
make
the
situation
as
annoying
as
possible
he
threatened
to
sue
for
libel
nevertheless
although
these
suits
eventually
did
come
to
nothing
for
he
had
fixed
it
so
that
he
could
not
be
traced
save
as
a
financial
agent
in
each
case
yet
the
charges
had
been
made
and
he
was
now
revealed
as
a
shrewd
manipulative
factor
with
a
record
that
was
certainly
spectacular
i
see
said
anson
merrill
to
his
wife
one
morning
at
breakfast
that
this
man
cowperwood
is
beginning
to
get
his
name
in
the
papers
he
had
the
times
on
the
table
before
him
and
was
looking
at
a
headline
which
after
the
pyramids
then
in
vogue
read
conspiracy
charged
against
various
chicago
citizens
frank
algernon
cowperwood
judson
van
sickle
henry
de
soto
sippens
and
others
named
in
circuit
court
complaint
it
went
on
to
specify
other
facts
i
supposed
he
was
just
a
broker
i
do
know
much
about
them
replied
his
wife
except
what
bella
simms
tells
me
what
does
it
say
he
handed
her
the
paper
i
have
always
thought
they
were
merely
climbers
continued
merrill
from
what
i
hear
she
is
impossible
i
never
saw
her
he
begins
well
for
a
philadelphian
smiled
merrill
i
seen
him
at
the
calumet
he
looks
like
a
very
shrewd
man
to
me
he
going
about
his
work
in
a
brisk
spirit
anyhow
similarly
norman
schryhart
a
man
who
up
to
this
time
had
taken
no
thought
of
cowperwood
although
he
had
noted
his
appearance
about
the
halls
of
the
calumet
and
union
league
clubs
began
to
ask
seriously
who
he
was
schryhart
a
man
of
great
physical
and
mental
vigor
six
feet
tall
hale
and
stolid
as
an
ox
a
very
different
type
of
man
from
anson
merrill
met
addison
one
day
at
the
calumet
club
shortly
after
the
newspaper
talk
began
sinking
into
a
great
leather
divan
beside
him
he
observed
who
is
this
man
cowperwood
whose
name
is
in
the
papers
these
days
addison
you
know
all
these
people
did
you
introduce
him
to
me
once
i
surely
did
replied
addison
cheerfully
who
in
spite
of
the
attacks
on
cowperwood
was
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
it
was
quite
plain
from
the
concurrent
excitement
that
attended
all
this
struggle
that
cowperwood
must
be
managing
things
rather
adroitly
and
best
of
all
he
was
keeping
his
backers
names
from
view
he
a
philadelphian
by
birth
he
came
out
here
several
years
ago
and
went
into
the
grain
and
commission
business
he
a
banker
now
a
rather
shrewd
man
i
should
say
he
has
a
lot
of
money
is
it
true
as
the
papers
say
that
he
failed
for
a
million
in
philadelphia
in
in
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
well
was
he
in
the
penitentiary
down
there
i
think
so
yes
i
believe
it
was
for
nothing
really
criminal
though
there
appears
to
have
been
some
from
all
i
can
learn
and
is
he
only
forty
as
the
papers
say
about
that
i
should
judge
why
oh
this
scheme
of
his
looks
rather
pretentious
to
me
holding
up
the
old
gas
companies
here
do
you
suppose
he
manage
to
do
it
i
do
know
that
all
i
know
is
what
i
have
read
in
the
papers
replied
addison
cautiously
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
care
to
talk
about
this
business
at
all
cowperwood
was
busy
at
this
very
time
through
an
agent
attempting
to
effect
a
compromise
and
union
of
all
interests
concerned
it
was
not
going
very
well
humph
commented
schryhart
he
was
wondering
why
men
like
himself
merrill
arneel
and
others
had
not
worked
into
this
field
long
ago
or
bought
out
the
old
companies
he
went
away
interested
and
a
day
or
two
later
even
the
next
morning
had
formulated
a
scheme
not
unlike
cowperwood
he
was
a
shrewd
hard
cold
man
he
believed
in
chicago
implicitly
and
in
all
that
related
to
its
future
this
gas
situation
now
that
cowperwood
had
seen
the
point
was
very
clear
to
him
even
yet
it
might
not
be
impossible
for
a
third
party
to
step
in
and
by
intricate
manipulation
secure
the
much
coveted
rewards
perhaps
cowperwood
himself
could
be
taken
over
who
could
tell
schryhart
being
a
very
dominating
type
of
person
did
not
believe
in
minor
partnerships
or
investments
if
he
went
into
a
thing
of
this
kind
it
was
his
preference
to
rule
he
decided
to
invite
cowperwood
to
visit
the
schryhart
office
and
talk
matters
over
accordingly
he
had
his
secretary
pen
a
note
which
in
rather
lofty
phrases
invited
cowperwood
to
call
on
a
matter
of
importance
now
just
at
this
time
it
so
chanced
cowperwood
was
feeling
rather
secure
as
to
his
place
in
the
chicago
financial
world
although
he
was
still
smarting
from
the
bitterness
of
the
aspersions
recently
cast
upon
him
from
various
quarters
under
such
circumstances
it
was
his
temperament
to
evince
a
rugged
contempt
for
humanity
rich
and
poor
alike
he
was
well
aware
that
schryhart
although
introduced
had
never
previously
troubled
to
notice
him
cowperwood
begs
me
to
say
wrote
miss
antoinette
nowak
at
his
dictation
that
he
finds
himself
very
much
pressed
for
time
at
present
but
he
would
be
glad
to
see
schryhart
at
his
office
at
any
time
this
irritated
the
dominating
schryhart
a
little
but
nevertheless
he
was
satisfied
that
a
conference
could
do
no
harm
in
this
instance
was
advisable
in
fact
so
one
wednesday
afternoon
he
journeyed
to
the
office
of
cowperwood
and
was
most
hospitably
received
how
do
you
do
schryhart
observed
cowperwood
cordially
extending
his
hand
i
glad
to
see
you
again
i
believe
we
met
once
before
several
years
ago
i
think
so
myself
replied
schryhart
who
was
and
with
a
short
black
mustache
gracing
a
firm
upper
lip
he
had
hard
dark
piercing
eyes
i
see
by
the
papers
if
they
can
be
trusted
he
said
coming
direct
to
the
point
that
you
are
interesting
yourself
in
local
gas
is
that
true
i
afraid
the
papers
can
not
be
generally
relied
on
replied
cowperwood
quite
blandly
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
makes
you
interested
to
know
whether
i
am
or
not
well
to
tell
the
truth
replied
schryhart
staring
at
the
financier
i
am
interested
in
this
local
gas
situation
myself
it
offers
a
rather
profitable
field
for
investment
and
several
members
of
the
old
companies
have
come
to
me
recently
to
ask
me
to
help
them
combine
this
was
not
true
at
all
i
have
been
wondering
what
chance
you
thought
you
had
of
winning
along
the
lines
you
are
now
taking
cowperwood
smiled
i
hardly
care
to
discuss
that
he
said
unless
i
know
much
more
of
your
motives
and
connections
than
i
do
at
present
do
i
understand
that
you
have
really
been
appealed
to
by
stockholders
of
the
old
companies
to
come
in
and
help
adjust
this
matter
exactly
said
schryhart
and
you
think
you
can
get
them
to
combine
on
what
basis
oh
i
should
say
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
give
each
of
them
two
or
three
shares
of
a
new
company
for
one
in
each
of
the
old
we
could
then
elect
one
set
of
officers
have
one
set
of
offices
stop
all
these
suits
and
leave
everybody
happy
he
said
this
in
an
easy
patronizing
way
as
though
cowperwood
had
not
really
thought
it
all
out
years
before
it
amazed
the
latter
no
little
to
see
his
own
scheme
patronizingly
brought
back
to
him
and
that
too
by
a
very
powerful
man
locally
one
who
thus
far
had
chosen
to
overlook
him
utterly
on
what
basis
asked
cowperwood
cautiously
would
you
expect
these
new
companies
to
come
in
on
the
same
basis
as
the
others
if
they
are
not
too
heavily
capitalized
i
have
thought
out
all
the
details
two
or
three
for
one
according
to
investment
of
course
the
prejudices
of
these
old
companies
have
to
be
considered
cowperwood
meditated
should
or
should
he
not
entertain
this
offer
here
was
a
chance
to
realize
quickly
by
selling
out
to
the
old
companies
only
schryhart
not
himself
would
be
taking
the
big
end
in
this
manipulative
deal
whereas
if
he
waited
even
if
schryhart
managed
to
combine
the
three
old
companies
into
one
he
might
be
able
to
force
better
terms
he
was
not
sure
finally
he
asked
how
much
stock
of
the
new
company
would
be
left
in
your
hands
or
in
the
hands
of
the
organizing
group
after
each
of
the
old
and
new
companies
had
been
provided
for
on
this
basis
oh
possibly
or
forty
per
cent
of
the
whole
replied
schryhart
ingratiatingly
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
quite
so
replied
cowperwood
smiling
but
seeing
that
i
am
the
man
who
has
been
cutting
the
pole
to
knock
this
persimmon
it
seems
to
me
that
a
pretty
good
share
of
that
should
come
to
me
do
you
think
so
just
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
have
said
i
personally
have
organized
the
new
companies
which
have
made
this
proposed
combination
possible
the
plan
you
propose
is
nothing
more
than
what
i
have
been
proposing
for
some
time
the
officers
and
directors
of
the
old
companies
are
angry
at
me
merely
because
i
am
supposed
to
have
invaded
the
fields
that
belong
to
them
now
if
on
account
of
that
they
are
willing
to
operate
through
you
rather
than
through
me
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
have
a
much
larger
share
in
the
surplus
my
personal
interest
in
these
new
companies
is
not
very
large
i
am
really
more
of
a
fiscal
agent
than
anything
else
this
was
not
true
but
cowperwood
preferred
to
have
his
guest
think
so
schryhart
smiled
but
my
dear
sir
he
explained
you
forget
that
i
will
be
supplying
nearly
all
the
capital
to
do
this
you
forget
retorted
cowperwood
that
i
am
not
a
novice
i
will
guarantee
to
supply
all
the
capital
myself
and
give
you
a
good
bonus
for
your
services
if
you
want
that
the
plants
and
franchises
of
the
old
and
new
companies
are
worth
something
you
must
remember
that
chicago
is
growing
i
know
that
replied
schryhart
evasively
but
i
also
know
that
you
have
a
long
expensive
fight
ahead
of
you
as
things
are
now
you
can
not
of
yourself
expect
to
bring
these
old
companies
to
terms
they
wo
work
with
you
as
i
understand
it
it
will
require
an
outsider
like
myself
some
one
of
influence
or
perhaps
i
had
better
say
of
old
standing
in
chicago
some
one
who
knows
these
people
to
bring
about
this
combination
have
you
any
one
do
you
think
who
can
do
it
better
than
i
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
that
i
will
find
some
one
replied
cowperwood
quite
easily
i
hardly
think
so
certainly
not
as
things
are
now
the
old
companies
are
not
disposed
to
work
through
you
and
they
are
through
me
you
think
you
had
better
accept
my
terms
and
allow
me
to
go
ahead
and
close
this
matter
up
not
at
all
on
that
basis
replied
cowperwood
quite
simply
we
have
invaded
the
enemies
country
too
far
and
done
too
much
three
for
one
or
four
for
one
whatever
terms
are
given
the
stockholders
of
the
old
companies
is
the
best
i
will
do
about
the
new
shares
and
i
must
have
of
whatever
is
left
for
myself
at
that
i
will
have
to
divide
with
others
this
was
not
true
either
no
replied
schryhart
evasively
and
opposingly
shaking
his
square
head
it
ca
be
done
the
risks
are
too
great
i
might
allow
you
possibly
i
ca
tell
yet
or
nothing
said
cowperwood
definitely
schryhart
got
up
that
the
best
you
will
do
is
it
he
inquired
the
very
best
i
afraid
then
he
said
we
ca
come
to
terms
i
sorry
you
may
find
this
a
rather
long
and
expensive
fight
i
have
fully
anticipated
that
replied
the
financier
chapter
xii
a
new
retainer
cowperwood
who
had
rebuffed
schryhart
so
courteously
but
firmly
was
to
learn
that
he
who
takes
the
sword
may
well
perish
by
the
sword
his
own
watchful
attorney
on
guard
at
the
state
capitol
where
certificates
of
incorporation
were
issued
in
the
city
and
village
councils
in
the
courts
and
so
forth
was
not
long
in
learning
that
a
of
significance
was
under
way
old
general
van
sickle
was
the
first
to
report
that
something
was
in
the
wind
in
connection
with
the
north
side
company
he
came
in
late
one
afternoon
his
dusty
greatcoat
thrown
loosely
about
his
shoulders
his
small
soft
hat
low
over
his
shaggy
eyes
and
in
response
to
cowperwood
evening
general
what
can
i
do
for
you
seated
himself
portentously
i
think
you
have
to
prepare
for
real
rough
weather
in
the
future
captain
he
remarked
addressing
the
financier
with
a
courtesy
title
that
he
had
fallen
in
the
habit
of
using
what
the
trouble
now
asked
cowperwood
no
real
trouble
as
yet
but
there
may
be
some
one
i
do
know
who
is
getting
these
three
old
companies
together
in
one
there
a
certificate
of
incorporation
been
applied
for
at
springfield
for
the
united
gas
and
fuel
company
of
chicago
and
there
are
some
meetings
now
going
on
at
the
douglas
trust
company
i
got
this
from
duniway
who
seems
to
have
friends
somewhere
that
know
cowperwood
put
the
ends
of
his
fingers
together
in
his
customary
way
and
began
to
tap
them
lightly
and
rhythmically
let
me
see
the
douglas
trust
company
simms
is
president
of
that
he
is
shrewd
enough
to
organize
a
thing
of
that
kind
who
are
the
incorporators
the
general
produced
a
list
of
four
names
none
of
them
officers
or
directors
of
the
old
companies
dummies
every
one
said
cowperwood
succinctly
i
think
i
know
he
said
after
a
few
moments
reflection
who
is
behind
it
general
but
do
let
that
worry
you
they
ca
harm
us
if
they
do
unite
they
bound
to
sell
out
to
us
or
buy
us
out
eventually
still
it
irritated
him
to
think
that
schryhart
had
succeeded
in
persuading
the
old
companies
to
combine
on
any
basis
he
had
meant
to
have
addison
go
shortly
posing
as
an
outside
party
and
propose
this
very
thing
schryhart
he
was
sure
had
acted
swiftly
following
their
interview
he
hurried
to
addison
office
in
the
lake
national
have
you
heard
the
news
exclaimed
that
individual
the
moment
cowperwood
appeared
they
planning
to
combine
it
schryhart
i
was
afraid
of
that
simms
of
the
douglas
trust
is
going
to
act
as
the
fiscal
agent
i
had
the
information
not
ten
minutes
ago
so
did
i
replied
cowperwood
calmly
we
should
have
acted
a
little
sooner
still
it
is
our
fault
exactly
do
you
know
the
terms
of
agreement
they
going
to
pool
their
stock
on
a
basis
of
three
to
one
with
about
thirty
per
cent
of
the
holding
company
left
for
schryhart
to
sell
or
keep
as
he
wants
to
he
guarantees
the
interest
we
did
that
for
him
drove
the
game
right
into
his
bag
nevertheless
replied
cowperwood
he
still
has
us
to
deal
with
i
propose
now
that
we
go
into
the
city
council
and
ask
for
a
blanket
franchise
it
can
be
had
if
we
should
get
it
it
will
bring
them
to
their
knees
we
will
really
be
in
a
better
position
than
they
are
with
these
smaller
companies
as
feeders
we
can
unite
with
ourselves
that
will
take
considerable
money
wo
it
not
so
much
we
may
never
need
to
lay
a
pipe
or
build
a
plant
they
will
offer
to
sell
out
buy
or
combine
before
that
we
can
fix
the
terms
leave
it
to
me
you
do
happen
to
know
by
any
chance
this
mckenty
who
has
so
much
say
in
local
affairs
here
john
j
mckenty
cowperwood
was
referring
to
a
man
who
was
at
once
gambler
rumored
owner
or
controller
of
a
series
of
houses
of
prostitution
rumored
maker
of
mayors
and
aldermen
rumored
financial
backer
of
many
saloons
and
contracting
companies
in
short
the
patron
saint
of
the
political
and
social
underworld
of
chicago
and
who
was
naturally
to
be
reckoned
with
in
matters
which
related
to
the
city
and
state
legislative
programme
i
do
said
addison
but
i
can
get
you
a
letter
why
do
trouble
to
ask
me
that
now
get
me
as
strong
an
introduction
as
you
can
i
have
one
for
you
some
time
replied
addison
efficiently
i
send
it
over
to
you
cowperwood
went
out
while
addison
speculated
as
to
this
newest
move
trust
cowperwood
to
dig
a
pit
into
which
the
enemy
might
fall
he
marveled
sometimes
at
the
man
resourcefulness
he
never
quarreled
with
the
directness
and
incisiveness
of
cowperwood
action
the
man
mckenty
whom
cowperwood
had
in
mind
in
this
rather
disturbing
hour
was
as
interesting
and
forceful
an
individual
as
one
would
care
to
meet
anywhere
a
typical
figure
of
chicago
and
the
west
at
the
time
he
was
a
pleasant
smiling
bland
affable
person
not
unlike
cowperwood
in
magnetism
and
subtlety
but
different
by
a
degree
of
animal
coarseness
not
visible
on
the
surface
which
cowperwood
would
scarcely
have
understood
and
in
a
kind
of
temperamental
pull
drawing
to
him
that
vast
pathetic
life
of
the
underworld
in
which
his
soul
found
its
solution
there
is
a
kind
of
nature
not
artistic
not
spiritual
in
no
way
emotional
nor
yet
unduly
philosophical
that
is
nevertheless
a
sphered
content
of
life
not
crystalline
perhaps
and
yet
not
utterly
dark
an
agate
temperament
cloudy
and
strange
as
a
child
mckenty
had
been
brought
from
ireland
by
his
emigrant
parents
during
a
period
of
famine
he
had
been
raised
on
the
far
south
side
in
a
shanty
which
stood
near
a
maze
of
and
as
a
naked
baby
he
had
crawled
on
its
earthen
floor
his
father
had
been
promoted
to
a
section
boss
after
working
for
years
as
a
on
the
adjoining
railroad
and
john
junior
one
of
eight
other
children
had
been
sent
out
early
to
do
many
things
to
be
an
in
a
store
a
for
a
telegraph
company
an
emergency
sweep
about
a
saloon
and
finally
a
bartender
this
last
was
his
true
beginning
for
he
was
discovered
by
a
politician
and
encouraged
to
run
for
the
state
legislature
and
to
study
law
even
as
a
stripling
what
things
had
he
not
learned
robbery
stuffing
the
sale
of
votes
the
appointive
power
of
leaders
graft
nepotism
vice
exploitation
all
the
things
that
go
to
make
up
or
did
the
american
world
of
politics
and
financial
and
social
strife
there
is
a
strong
assumption
in
the
upper
walks
of
life
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
at
the
bottom
if
you
could
have
looked
into
the
capacious
but
balanced
temperament
of
john
mckenty
you
would
have
seen
a
strange
wisdom
there
and
stranger
memories
whole
worlds
of
brutalities
tendernesses
errors
immoralities
suffered
endured
even
rejoiced
in
the
hardy
eager
life
of
the
animal
that
has
nothing
but
its
perceptions
instincts
appetites
to
guide
it
yet
the
man
had
the
air
and
the
poise
of
a
gentleman
at
mckenty
was
an
exceedingly
important
personage
his
roomy
house
on
the
west
side
at
harrison
street
and
ashland
avenue
was
visited
at
sundry
times
by
financiers
business
men
priests
in
short
the
whole
range
and
gamut
of
active
subtle
political
life
from
mckenty
they
could
obtain
that
counsel
wisdom
surety
solution
which
all
of
them
on
occasion
were
anxious
to
have
and
which
in
one
deft
way
and
another
often
by
no
more
than
gratitude
and
an
acknowledgment
of
his
leadership
they
were
willing
to
pay
for
to
police
captains
and
officers
whose
places
he
occasionally
saved
when
they
should
justly
have
been
discharged
to
mothers
whose
erring
boys
or
girls
he
took
out
of
prison
and
sent
home
again
to
keepers
of
bawdy
houses
whom
he
protected
from
a
too
harsh
invasion
of
the
grafting
propensities
of
the
local
police
to
politicians
and
who
were
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
by
public
upheavals
of
one
kind
and
another
he
seemed
in
hours
of
stress
when
his
smooth
genial
almost
artistic
face
beamed
on
them
like
a
son
of
light
a
kind
of
western
god
perfect
on
the
other
hand
there
were
ingrates
uncompromising
or
pharasaical
religionists
and
reformers
plotting
scheming
rivals
who
found
him
deadly
to
contend
with
there
were
many
henchmen
runners
from
an
almost
imperial
throne
to
do
his
bidding
he
was
simple
in
dress
and
taste
married
and
apparently
very
happy
a
professing
though
virtually
catholic
a
suave
genial
man
powerful
and
enigmatic
when
cowperwood
and
mckenty
first
met
it
was
on
a
spring
evening
at
the
latter
home
the
windows
of
the
large
house
were
pleasantly
open
though
screened
and
the
curtains
were
blowing
faintly
in
a
light
air
along
with
a
sense
of
the
new
green
life
everywhere
came
a
breath
of
on
the
presentation
of
addison
letter
and
of
another
secured
through
van
sickle
from
a
political
judge
cowperwood
had
been
invited
to
call
on
his
arrival
he
was
offered
a
drink
a
cigar
introduced
to
mckenty
who
lacking
an
organized
social
life
of
any
kind
was
always
pleased
to
meet
these
celebrities
of
the
upper
world
if
only
for
a
moment
and
shown
eventually
into
the
library
mckenty
as
he
might
have
observed
if
he
had
had
the
eye
for
it
was
plump
and
fifty
a
sort
of
superannuated
aileen
but
still
showing
traces
of
a
former
hardy
beauty
and
concealing
pretty
well
the
evidences
that
she
had
once
been
a
prostitute
it
so
happened
that
on
this
particular
evening
mckenty
was
in
a
most
genial
frame
of
mind
there
were
no
immediate
political
troubles
bothering
him
just
now
it
was
early
in
may
outside
the
trees
were
budding
the
sparrows
and
robins
were
voicing
their
several
moods
a
delicious
haze
was
in
the
air
and
some
early
mosquitoes
were
reconnoitering
the
screens
which
protected
the
windows
and
doors
cowperwood
in
spite
of
his
various
troubles
was
in
a
complacent
state
of
mind
himself
he
liked
life
even
its
very
difficult
complications
perhaps
its
complications
best
of
all
nature
was
beautiful
tender
at
times
but
difficulties
plans
plots
schemes
to
unravel
and
make
smooth
these
things
were
what
made
existence
worth
while
well
now
cowperwood
mckenty
began
when
they
finally
entered
the
cool
pleasant
library
what
can
i
do
for
you
well
mckenty
said
cowperwood
choosing
his
words
and
bringing
the
finest
resources
of
his
temperament
into
play
it
is
so
much
and
yet
it
is
i
want
a
franchise
from
the
chicago
city
council
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
it
if
you
will
i
know
you
may
say
to
me
why
not
go
to
the
councilmen
direct
i
would
do
that
except
that
there
are
certain
other
elements
individuals
who
might
come
to
you
it
wo
offend
you
i
know
when
i
say
that
i
have
always
understood
that
you
are
a
sort
of
for
political
troubles
in
chicago
mckenty
smiled
that
flattering
he
replied
dryly
now
i
am
rather
new
myself
to
chicago
went
on
cowperwood
softly
i
have
been
here
only
a
year
or
two
i
come
from
philadelphia
i
have
been
interested
as
a
fiscal
agent
and
an
investor
in
several
gas
companies
that
have
been
organized
in
lake
view
hyde
park
and
elsewhere
outside
the
city
limits
as
you
may
possibly
have
seen
by
the
papers
lately
i
am
not
their
owner
in
the
sense
that
i
have
provided
all
or
even
a
good
part
of
the
money
invested
in
them
i
am
not
even
their
manager
except
in
a
very
general
way
i
might
better
be
called
their
promoter
and
guardian
but
i
am
that
for
other
people
and
myself
mckenty
nodded
now
mckenty
it
was
not
very
long
after
i
started
out
to
get
franchises
to
do
business
in
lake
view
and
hyde
park
before
i
found
myself
confronted
by
the
interests
which
control
the
three
old
city
gas
companies
they
were
very
much
opposed
to
our
entering
the
field
in
cook
county
anywhere
as
you
may
imagine
although
we
were
not
really
crowding
in
on
their
field
since
then
they
have
fought
me
with
lawsuits
injunctions
and
charges
of
bribery
and
conspiracy
i
know
put
in
mckenty
i
have
heard
something
of
it
quite
so
replied
cowperwood
because
of
their
opposition
i
made
them
an
offer
to
combine
these
three
companies
and
the
three
new
ones
into
one
take
out
a
new
charter
and
give
the
city
a
uniform
gas
service
they
would
not
do
that
largely
because
i
was
an
outsider
i
think
since
then
another
person
schryhart
mckenty
nodded
who
has
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
gas
business
here
has
stepped
in
and
offered
to
combine
them
his
plan
is
to
do
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
do
only
his
further
proposition
is
once
he
has
the
three
old
companies
united
to
invade
this
new
gas
field
of
ours
and
hold
us
up
or
force
us
to
sell
by
obtaining
rival
franchises
in
these
outlying
places
there
is
talk
of
combining
these
suburbs
with
chicago
as
you
know
which
would
allow
these
three
franchises
to
become
mutually
operative
with
our
own
this
makes
it
essential
for
us
to
do
one
of
several
things
as
you
may
see
either
to
sell
out
on
the
best
terms
we
can
now
or
to
continue
the
fight
at
a
rather
heavy
expense
without
making
any
attempt
to
strike
back
or
to
get
into
the
city
council
and
ask
for
a
franchise
to
do
business
in
the
section
a
general
blanket
franchise
to
sell
gas
in
chicago
alongside
of
the
old
companies
with
the
sole
intention
of
protecting
ourselves
as
one
of
my
officers
is
fond
of
saying
added
cowperwood
humorously
mckenty
smiled
again
i
see
he
said
is
that
a
rather
large
order
though
cowperwood
seeking
a
new
franchise
do
you
suppose
the
general
public
would
agree
that
the
city
needs
an
extra
gas
company
it
true
the
old
companies
have
been
any
too
generous
my
own
gas
is
of
the
best
he
smiled
vaguely
prepared
to
listen
further
now
mckenty
i
know
that
you
are
a
practical
man
went
on
cowperwood
ignoring
this
interruption
and
so
am
i
am
not
coming
to
you
with
any
vague
story
concerning
my
troubles
and
expecting
you
to
be
interested
as
a
matter
of
sympathy
i
realize
that
to
go
into
the
city
council
of
chicago
with
a
legitimate
proposition
is
one
thing
to
get
it
passed
and
approved
by
the
city
authorities
is
another
i
need
advice
and
assistance
and
i
am
not
begging
it
if
i
could
get
a
general
franchise
such
as
i
have
described
it
would
be
worth
a
very
great
deal
of
money
to
me
it
would
help
me
to
close
up
and
realize
on
these
new
companies
which
are
entirely
sound
and
needed
it
would
help
me
to
prevent
the
old
companies
from
eating
me
up
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
must
have
such
a
franchise
to
protect
my
interests
and
give
me
a
running
fighting
chance
now
i
know
that
none
of
us
are
in
politics
or
finance
for
our
health
if
i
could
get
such
a
franchise
it
would
be
worth
from
to
of
all
i
personally
would
make
out
of
it
providing
my
plan
of
combining
these
new
companies
with
the
old
ones
should
go
through
say
from
three
to
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
here
again
cowperwood
was
not
quite
frank
but
safe
it
is
needless
to
say
to
you
that
i
can
command
ample
capital
this
franchise
would
do
that
briefly
i
want
to
know
if
you
wo
give
me
your
political
support
in
this
matter
and
join
in
with
me
on
the
basis
that
i
propose
i
will
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
you
beforehand
who
my
associates
are
i
will
put
all
the
data
and
details
on
the
table
before
you
so
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
things
are
if
you
should
find
at
any
time
that
i
have
misrepresented
anything
you
are
at
full
liberty
of
course
to
withdraw
as
i
said
before
he
concluded
i
am
not
a
beggar
i
am
not
coming
here
to
conceal
any
facts
or
to
hide
anything
which
might
deceive
you
as
to
the
worth
of
all
this
to
us
i
want
you
to
know
the
facts
i
want
you
to
give
me
your
aid
on
such
terms
as
you
think
are
fair
and
equitable
really
the
only
trouble
with
me
in
this
situation
is
that
i
am
not
a
silk
stocking
if
i
were
this
gas
war
would
have
been
adjusted
long
ago
these
gentlemen
who
are
so
willing
to
reorganize
through
schryhart
are
largely
opposed
to
me
because
i
am
comparatively
a
stranger
in
chicago
and
not
in
their
set
if
i
were
he
moved
his
hand
slightly
i
suppose
i
would
be
here
this
evening
asking
for
your
favor
although
that
does
not
say
that
i
am
not
glad
to
be
here
or
that
i
would
not
be
glad
to
work
with
you
in
any
way
that
i
might
circumstances
simply
have
not
thrown
me
across
your
path
before
as
he
talked
his
eye
fixed
mckenty
steadily
almost
innocently
and
the
latter
following
him
clearly
felt
all
the
while
that
he
was
listening
to
a
strange
able
dark
and
very
forceful
man
there
was
no
beating
about
the
bush
here
no
squeamishness
of
spirit
and
yet
there
was
subtlety
the
kind
mckenty
liked
while
he
was
amused
by
casual
reference
to
the
silk
stockings
who
were
keeping
him
out
it
appealed
to
him
he
caught
the
point
of
view
as
well
as
the
intention
of
it
cowperwood
represented
a
new
and
rather
pleasing
type
of
financier
to
him
evidently
he
was
traveling
in
able
company
if
one
could
believe
the
men
who
had
introduced
him
so
warmly
mckenty
as
cowperwood
was
well
aware
had
personally
no
interest
in
the
old
companies
and
also
though
this
he
did
not
say
no
particular
sympathy
with
them
they
were
just
remote
financial
corporations
to
him
paying
political
tribute
on
demand
expecting
political
favors
in
return
every
few
weeks
now
they
were
in
council
asking
for
one
franchise
after
another
special
privileges
in
certain
streets
asking
for
better
more
profitable
asking
for
dock
privileges
in
the
river
a
lower
tax
rate
and
so
forth
and
so
on
mckenty
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
these
things
personally
he
had
a
subordinate
in
council
a
very
powerful
henchman
by
the
name
of
patrick
dowling
a
meaty
vigorous
irishman
and
a
true
of
graft
for
the
machine
who
worked
with
the
mayor
the
city
treasurer
the
city
tax
receiver
in
fact
all
the
officers
of
the
current
administration
and
saw
that
such
minor
matters
were
properly
equalized
mckenty
had
only
met
two
or
three
of
the
officers
of
the
south
side
gas
company
and
that
quite
casually
he
did
not
like
them
very
well
the
truth
was
that
the
old
companies
were
officered
by
men
who
considered
politicians
of
the
mckenty
and
dowling
stripe
as
very
evil
men
if
they
paid
them
and
did
other
such
wicked
things
it
was
because
they
were
forced
to
do
so
well
mckenty
replied
lingering
his
thin
gold
in
a
thoughtful
manner
that
an
interesting
scheme
you
have
of
course
the
old
companies
would
like
your
asking
for
a
rival
franchise
but
once
you
had
it
they
could
object
very
well
could
they
he
smiled
mckenty
spoke
with
no
suggestion
of
a
brogue
from
one
point
of
view
it
might
be
looked
upon
as
bad
business
but
not
entirely
they
would
be
sure
to
make
a
great
cry
though
they
have
been
any
too
kind
to
the
public
themselves
but
if
you
offered
to
combine
with
them
i
see
no
objection
it
certain
to
be
as
good
for
them
in
the
long
run
as
it
is
for
you
this
merely
permits
you
to
make
a
better
bargain
exactly
said
cowperwood
and
you
have
the
means
you
tell
me
to
lay
mains
in
every
part
of
the
city
and
fight
with
them
for
business
if
they
wo
give
in
i
have
the
means
said
cowperwood
or
if
i
have
i
can
get
them
mckenty
looked
at
cowperwood
very
solemnly
there
was
a
kind
of
mutual
sympathy
understanding
and
admiration
between
the
two
men
but
it
was
still
heavily
veiled
by
to
mckenty
cowperwood
was
interesting
because
he
was
one
of
the
few
business
men
he
had
met
who
were
not
ponderous
pharasaical
even
hypocritical
when
they
were
dealing
with
him
well
i
tell
you
what
i
do
cowperwood
he
said
finally
i
take
it
all
under
consideration
let
me
think
it
over
until
monday
anyhow
there
is
more
of
an
excuse
now
for
the
introduction
of
a
general
gas
ordinance
than
there
would
be
a
little
later
i
can
see
that
why
do
you
draw
up
your
proposed
franchise
and
let
me
see
it
then
we
might
find
out
what
some
of
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
city
council
think
cowperwood
almost
smiled
at
the
word
gentlemen
i
have
already
done
that
he
said
here
it
is
mckenty
took
it
surprised
and
yet
pleased
at
this
evidence
of
business
proficiency
he
liked
a
strong
manipulator
of
this
kind
the
more
since
he
was
not
one
himself
and
most
of
those
that
he
did
know
were
and
squeamish
let
me
take
this
he
said
i
see
you
next
monday
again
if
you
wish
come
monday
cowperwood
got
up
i
thought
i
come
and
talk
to
you
direct
mckenty
he
said
and
now
i
glad
that
i
did
you
will
find
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
into
this
matter
that
it
is
just
as
i
represent
it
there
is
a
very
great
deal
of
money
here
in
one
way
and
another
though
it
will
take
some
little
time
to
work
it
out
mckenty
saw
the
point
yes
he
said
sweetly
to
be
sure
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
as
they
shook
hands
i
not
sure
but
you
have
hit
upon
a
very
good
idea
here
concluded
mckenty
sympathetically
a
very
good
idea
indeed
come
and
see
me
again
next
monday
or
about
that
time
and
i
let
you
know
what
i
think
come
any
time
you
have
anything
else
you
want
of
me
i
always
be
glad
to
see
you
it
a
fine
night
is
it
he
added
looking
out
as
they
neared
the
door
a
nice
moon
that
he
added
a
sickle
moon
was
in
the
sky
good
night
chapter
xiii
the
die
is
cast
the
significance
of
this
visit
was
not
long
in
manifesting
itself
at
the
top
in
large
affairs
life
goes
off
into
almost
inexplicable
tangles
of
personalities
mckenty
now
that
the
matter
had
been
called
to
his
attention
was
interested
to
learn
about
this
gas
situation
from
all
sides
whether
it
might
not
be
more
profitable
to
deal
with
the
schryhart
end
of
the
argument
and
so
on
but
his
eventual
conclusion
was
that
cowperwood
plan
as
he
had
outlined
it
was
the
most
feasible
for
political
purposes
largely
because
the
schryhart
faction
not
being
in
a
position
where
they
needed
to
ask
the
city
council
for
anything
at
present
were
so
obtuse
as
to
forget
to
make
overtures
of
any
kind
to
the
bucaneering
forces
at
the
city
hall
when
cowperwood
next
came
to
mckenty
house
the
latter
was
in
a
receptive
frame
of
mind
well
he
said
after
a
few
genial
preliminary
remarks
i
been
learning
what
going
on
your
proposition
is
fair
enough
organize
your
company
and
arrange
your
plan
conditionally
then
introduce
your
ordinance
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
they
went
into
a
long
intimate
discussion
as
to
how
the
forthcoming
stock
should
be
divided
how
it
was
to
be
held
in
escrow
by
a
favorite
bank
of
mckenty
until
the
terms
of
the
agreement
under
the
eventual
affiliation
with
the
old
companies
or
the
new
union
company
should
be
fulfilled
and
details
of
that
sort
it
was
rather
a
complicated
arrangement
not
as
satisfactory
to
cowperwood
as
it
might
have
been
but
satisfactory
in
that
it
permitted
him
to
win
it
required
the
undivided
services
of
general
van
sickle
henry
de
soto
sippens
kent
barrows
mckibben
and
alderman
dowling
for
some
little
time
but
finally
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
coup
on
a
certain
monday
night
therefore
following
the
thursday
on
which
according
to
the
rules
of
the
city
council
an
ordinance
of
this
character
would
have
to
be
introduced
the
plan
after
being
publicly
broached
but
this
very
little
while
was
quickly
considered
by
the
city
council
and
passed
there
had
been
really
no
time
for
public
discussion
this
was
just
the
thing
of
course
that
cowperwood
and
mckenty
were
trying
to
avoid
on
the
day
following
the
particular
thursday
on
which
the
ordinance
had
been
broached
in
council
as
certain
to
be
brought
up
for
passage
schryhart
through
his
lawyers
and
the
officers
of
the
old
individual
gas
companies
had
run
to
the
newspapers
and
denounced
the
whole
thing
as
plain
robbery
but
what
were
they
to
do
there
was
so
little
time
for
agitation
true
the
newspapers
obedient
to
this
larger
financial
influence
began
to
talk
of
fair
play
to
the
old
companies
and
the
uselessness
of
two
large
rival
companies
in
the
field
when
one
would
serve
as
well
still
the
public
instructed
or
urged
by
the
mckenty
agents
to
the
contrary
were
not
prepared
to
believe
it
they
had
not
been
so
well
treated
by
the
old
companies
as
to
make
any
outcry
on
their
behalf
standing
outside
the
city
council
door
on
the
monday
evening
when
the
bill
was
finally
passed
samuel
blackman
president
of
the
south
side
gas
company
a
little
wispy
man
with
whiskers
declared
emphatically
this
is
a
scoundrelly
piece
of
business
if
the
mayor
signs
that
he
should
be
impeached
there
is
not
a
vote
in
there
that
has
not
been
purchased
not
one
this
is
a
fine
element
of
brigandage
to
introduce
into
chicago
why
people
who
have
worked
years
and
years
to
build
up
a
business
are
not
safe
it
true
every
word
of
it
complained
jordan
jules
president
of
the
north
side
company
a
short
stout
man
with
a
head
like
an
egg
lying
lengthwise
a
mere
fringe
of
hair
and
hard
blue
eyes
he
was
with
hudson
baker
tall
and
ambling
who
was
president
of
the
west
chicago
company
all
of
these
had
come
to
protest
it
that
scoundrel
from
philadelphia
he
the
cause
of
all
our
troubles
it
high
time
the
respectable
business
element
of
chicago
realized
just
what
sort
of
a
man
they
have
to
deal
with
in
him
he
ought
to
be
driven
out
of
here
look
at
his
philadelphia
record
they
sent
him
to
the
penitentiary
down
there
and
they
ought
to
do
it
here
baker
very
recently
the
guest
of
schryhart
and
his
henchman
too
was
also
properly
chagrined
the
man
is
a
charlatan
he
protested
to
blackman
he
does
play
fair
it
is
plain
that
he
does
belong
in
respectable
society
nevertheless
and
in
spite
of
this
the
ordinance
was
passed
it
was
a
bitter
lesson
for
norman
schryhart
norrie
simms
and
all
those
who
had
unfortunately
become
involved
a
committee
composed
of
all
three
of
the
old
companies
visited
the
mayor
but
the
latter
a
tool
of
mckenty
giving
his
future
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
signed
it
just
the
same
cowperwood
had
his
franchise
and
groan
as
they
might
it
was
now
necessary
in
the
language
of
a
later
day
to
step
up
and
see
the
captain
only
schryhart
felt
personally
that
his
score
with
cowperwood
was
not
settled
he
would
meet
him
on
some
other
ground
later
the
next
time
he
would
try
to
fight
fire
with
fire
but
for
the
present
shrewd
man
that
he
was
he
was
prepared
to
compromise
thereafter
dissembling
his
chagrin
as
best
he
could
he
kept
on
the
lookout
for
cowperwood
at
both
of
the
clubs
of
which
he
was
a
member
but
cowperwood
had
avoided
them
during
this
period
of
excitement
and
mahomet
would
have
to
go
to
the
mountain
so
one
drowsy
june
afternoon
schryhart
called
at
cowperwood
office
he
had
on
a
bright
new
suit
and
a
straw
hat
from
his
pocket
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
protruded
a
neat
silk
handkerchief
and
his
feet
were
immaculate
in
new
shining
oxford
ties
i
sailing
for
europe
in
a
few
days
cowperwood
he
remarked
genially
and
i
thought
i
drop
round
to
see
if
you
and
i
could
reach
some
agreement
in
regard
to
this
gas
situation
the
officers
of
the
old
companies
naturally
feel
that
they
do
not
care
to
have
a
rival
in
the
field
and
i
sure
that
you
are
not
interested
in
carrying
on
a
useless
rate
war
that
wo
leave
anybody
any
profit
i
recall
that
you
were
willing
to
compromise
on
a
basis
with
me
before
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
were
still
of
that
mind
sit
down
sit
down
schryhart
remarked
cowperwood
cheerfully
waving
the
to
a
chair
i
pleased
to
see
you
again
no
i
no
more
anxious
for
a
rate
war
than
you
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
hope
to
avoid
it
but
as
you
see
things
have
changed
somewhat
since
i
saw
you
the
gentlemen
who
have
organized
and
invested
their
money
in
this
new
city
gas
company
are
perfectly
willing
rather
anxious
in
fact
to
go
on
and
establish
a
legitimate
business
they
feel
all
the
confidence
in
the
world
that
they
can
do
this
and
i
agree
with
them
a
compromise
might
be
effected
between
the
old
and
the
new
companies
but
not
on
the
basis
on
which
i
was
willing
to
settle
some
time
ago
a
new
company
has
been
organized
since
then
stock
issued
and
a
great
deal
of
money
expended
this
was
not
true
that
stock
will
have
to
figure
in
any
new
agreement
i
think
a
general
union
of
all
the
companies
is
desirable
but
it
will
have
to
be
on
a
basis
of
one
two
three
or
four
shares
whatever
is
decided
at
par
for
all
stock
involved
schryhart
pulled
a
long
face
do
you
think
that
rather
steep
he
said
solemnly
not
at
all
not
at
all
replied
cowperwood
you
know
these
new
expenditures
were
not
undertaken
voluntarily
the
irony
of
this
did
not
escape
schryhart
but
he
said
nothing
i
admit
all
that
but
do
you
think
since
your
shares
are
worth
practically
nothing
at
present
that
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
they
were
accepted
at
par
i
ca
see
why
replied
cowperwood
our
future
prospects
are
splendid
there
must
be
an
even
adjustment
here
or
nothing
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
much
treasury
stock
you
would
expect
to
have
in
the
safe
for
the
promotion
of
this
new
organization
after
all
the
old
stockholders
have
been
satisfied
well
as
i
thought
before
from
thirty
to
forty
per
cent
of
the
total
issue
replied
schryhart
still
hopeful
of
a
profitable
adjustment
i
should
think
it
could
be
worked
on
that
basis
and
who
gets
that
why
the
organizer
said
schryhart
evasively
yourself
perhaps
and
myself
and
how
would
you
divide
it
half
and
half
as
before
i
should
think
that
would
be
fair
it
is
enough
returned
cowperwood
incisively
since
i
talked
to
you
last
i
have
been
compelled
to
shoulder
obligations
and
make
agreements
which
i
did
not
anticipate
then
the
best
i
can
do
now
is
to
accept
schryhart
straightened
up
determinedly
and
offensively
this
was
outrageous
he
thought
impossible
the
effrontery
of
it
it
can
never
be
done
cowperwood
he
replied
forcefully
you
are
trying
to
unload
too
much
worthless
stock
on
the
company
as
it
is
the
old
companies
stock
is
selling
right
now
as
you
know
for
from
to
your
stock
is
worth
nothing
if
you
are
to
be
given
two
or
three
for
one
for
that
and
of
the
remainder
in
the
treasury
i
for
one
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
deal
you
would
be
in
control
of
the
company
and
it
will
be
at
that
talk
about
getting
something
for
nothing
the
best
i
would
suggest
to
the
stockholders
of
the
old
companies
would
be
half
and
half
and
i
may
say
to
you
frankly
although
you
may
not
believe
it
that
the
old
companies
will
not
join
in
with
you
in
any
scheme
that
gives
you
control
they
are
too
much
incensed
feeling
is
running
too
high
it
will
mean
a
long
expensive
fight
and
they
will
never
compromise
now
if
you
have
anything
really
reasonable
to
offer
i
would
be
glad
to
hear
it
otherwise
i
am
afraid
these
negotiations
are
not
going
to
come
to
anything
share
and
share
alike
and
of
the
remainder
repeated
cowperwood
grimly
i
do
not
want
to
control
if
they
want
to
raise
the
money
and
buy
me
out
on
that
basis
i
am
willing
to
sell
i
want
a
decent
return
for
investments
i
have
made
and
i
am
going
to
have
it
i
can
not
speak
for
the
others
behind
me
but
as
long
as
they
deal
through
me
that
is
what
they
will
expect
schryhart
went
angrily
away
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
this
proposition
as
cowperwood
now
outlined
it
was
bucaneering
at
its
best
he
proposed
for
himself
to
withdraw
from
the
old
companies
if
necessary
to
close
out
his
holdings
and
let
the
old
companies
deal
with
cowperwood
as
best
they
could
so
long
as
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
cowperwood
should
never
gain
control
of
the
gas
situation
better
to
take
him
at
his
suggestion
raise
the
money
and
buy
him
out
even
at
an
exorbitant
figure
then
the
old
gas
companies
could
go
along
and
do
business
in
their
way
without
being
disturbed
this
bucaneer
this
upstart
what
a
shrewd
quick
forceful
move
he
had
made
it
irritated
schryhart
greatly
the
end
of
all
this
was
a
compromise
in
which
cowperwood
accepted
of
the
surplus
stock
of
the
new
general
issue
and
two
for
one
of
every
share
of
stock
for
which
his
new
companies
had
been
organized
at
the
same
time
selling
out
to
the
old
companies
clearing
out
completely
it
was
a
most
profitable
deal
and
he
was
enabled
to
provide
handsomely
not
only
for
mckenty
and
addison
but
for
all
the
others
connected
with
him
it
was
a
splendid
coup
as
mckenty
and
addison
assured
him
having
now
done
so
much
he
began
to
turn
his
eyes
elsewhere
for
other
fields
to
conquer
but
this
victory
in
one
direction
brought
with
it
corresponding
reverses
in
another
the
social
future
of
cowperwood
and
aileen
was
now
in
great
jeopardy
schryhart
who
was
a
force
socially
having
met
with
defeat
at
the
hands
of
cowperwood
was
now
bitterly
opposed
to
him
norrie
simms
naturally
sided
with
his
old
associates
but
the
worst
blow
came
through
anson
merrill
shortly
after
the
housewarming
and
when
the
gas
argument
and
the
conspiracy
charges
were
rising
to
their
heights
she
had
been
to
new
york
and
had
there
chanced
to
encounter
an
old
acquaintance
of
hers
martyn
walker
of
philadelphia
one
of
the
circle
which
cowperwood
once
upon
a
time
had
been
vainly
ambitious
to
enter
merrill
aware
of
the
interest
the
cowperwoods
had
aroused
in
simms
and
others
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
find
out
something
definite
by
the
way
did
you
ever
chance
to
hear
of
a
frank
algernon
cowperwood
or
his
wife
in
philadelphia
she
inquired
of
walker
why
my
dear
nellie
replied
her
friend
nonplussed
that
a
woman
so
smart
as
merrill
should
even
refer
to
them
have
those
people
established
themselves
in
chicago
his
career
in
philadelphia
was
to
say
the
least
spectacular
he
was
connected
with
a
city
treasurer
there
who
stole
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
they
both
went
to
the
penitentiary
that
was
the
worst
of
it
he
became
intimate
with
some
young
girl
a
miss
butler
the
sister
of
owen
butler
by
the
way
who
is
now
such
a
power
down
there
and
she
merely
lifted
her
eyes
while
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
her
father
died
and
the
family
broke
up
i
even
heard
it
rumored
that
the
old
gentleman
killed
himself
she
was
referring
to
aileen
father
edward
malia
butler
when
he
came
out
of
the
penitentiary
cowperwood
disappeared
and
i
did
hear
some
one
say
that
he
had
gone
west
and
divorced
his
wife
and
married
again
his
first
wife
is
still
living
in
philadelphia
somewhere
with
his
two
children
merrill
was
properly
astonished
but
she
did
not
show
it
quite
an
interesting
story
is
it
she
commented
distantly
thinking
how
easy
it
would
be
to
adjust
the
cowperwood
situation
and
how
pleased
she
was
that
she
had
never
shown
any
interest
in
them
did
you
ever
see
her
his
new
wife
i
think
so
but
i
forget
where
i
believe
she
used
to
ride
and
drive
a
great
deal
in
philadelphia
did
she
have
red
hair
oh
yes
she
was
a
very
striking
blonde
i
fancy
it
must
be
the
same
person
they
have
been
in
the
papers
recently
in
chicago
i
wanted
to
be
sure
merrill
was
meditating
some
fine
comments
to
be
made
in
the
future
i
suppose
now
they
trying
to
get
into
chicago
society
walker
smiled
condescendingly
and
contemptuously
as
much
at
chicago
society
as
at
the
cowperwoods
it
possible
that
they
might
attempt
something
like
that
in
the
east
and
succeed
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
merrill
caustically
resenting
the
slur
but
attempting
and
achieving
are
quite
different
things
in
chicago
the
answer
was
sufficient
it
ended
the
discussion
when
next
simms
was
rash
enough
to
mention
the
cowperwoods
or
rather
the
peculiar
publicity
in
connection
with
him
her
future
viewpoint
was
definitely
fixed
for
her
if
you
take
my
advice
commented
merrill
finally
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
these
friends
of
yours
the
better
i
know
all
about
them
you
might
have
seen
that
from
the
first
they
can
never
be
accepted
merrill
did
not
trouble
to
explain
why
but
simms
through
her
husband
soon
learned
the
whole
truth
and
she
was
righteously
indignant
and
even
terrified
who
was
to
blame
for
this
sort
of
thing
anyhow
she
thought
who
had
introduced
them
the
addisons
of
course
but
the
addisons
were
socially
unassailable
if
not
and
so
the
best
had
to
be
made
of
that
but
the
cowperwoods
could
be
dropped
from
the
lists
of
herself
and
her
friends
instantly
and
that
was
now
done
a
sudden
slump
in
their
social
significance
began
to
manifest
itself
though
not
so
swiftly
but
what
for
the
time
being
it
was
slightly
deceptive
the
first
evidence
of
change
which
aileen
observed
was
when
the
customary
cards
and
invitations
for
receptions
and
the
like
which
had
come
to
them
quite
freely
of
late
began
to
decline
sharply
in
number
and
when
the
guests
to
her
own
wednesday
afternoons
which
rather
prematurely
she
had
ventured
to
establish
became
a
mere
negligible
handful
at
first
she
could
not
understand
this
not
being
willing
to
believe
that
following
so
soon
upon
her
apparent
triumph
as
a
hostess
in
her
own
home
there
could
be
so
marked
a
decline
in
her
local
importance
of
a
possible
or
fifty
who
might
have
called
or
left
cards
within
three
weeks
after
the
housewarming
only
twenty
responded
a
week
later
it
had
declined
to
ten
and
within
five
weeks
all
told
there
was
scarcely
a
caller
it
is
true
that
a
very
few
of
the
unimportant
those
who
had
looked
to
her
for
influence
and
the
taylor
lord
and
kent
mckibben
who
were
commercially
obligated
to
cowperwood
were
still
faithful
but
they
were
really
worse
than
nothing
aileen
was
beside
herself
with
disappointment
opposition
chagrin
shame
there
are
many
natures
and
who
can
endure
almost
any
rebuff
in
the
hope
of
eventual
victory
who
are
almost
too
to
suffer
but
hers
was
not
one
of
these
already
in
spite
of
her
original
daring
in
regard
to
the
opinion
of
society
and
the
rights
of
the
former
cowperwood
she
was
sensitive
on
the
score
of
her
future
and
what
her
past
might
mean
to
her
really
her
original
actions
could
be
attributed
to
her
youthful
passion
and
the
powerful
sex
magnetism
of
cowperwood
under
more
fortunate
circumstances
she
would
have
married
safely
enough
and
without
the
scandal
which
followed
as
it
was
now
her
social
future
here
needed
to
end
satisfactorily
in
order
to
justify
herself
to
herself
and
she
thought
to
him
you
may
put
the
sandwiches
in
the
she
said
to
louis
the
butler
after
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
at
home
failures
referring
to
the
undue
supply
of
titbits
which
uneaten
honored
some
fine
sevres
with
their
presence
send
the
flowers
to
the
hospital
the
servants
may
drink
the
claret
cup
and
lemonade
keep
some
of
the
cakes
fresh
for
dinner
the
butler
nodded
his
head
yes
madame
he
said
then
by
way
of
pouring
oil
on
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
troubled
situation
he
added
eet
a
rough
day
i
suppose
zat
has
somepsing
to
do
weeth
it
aileen
was
aflame
in
a
moment
she
was
about
to
exclaim
mind
your
business
but
changed
her
mind
yes
i
presume
so
was
her
answer
as
she
ascended
to
her
room
if
a
single
poor
at
home
was
to
be
commented
on
by
servants
things
were
coming
to
a
pretty
pass
she
waited
until
the
next
week
to
see
whether
this
was
the
weather
or
a
real
change
in
public
sentiment
it
was
worse
than
the
one
before
the
singers
she
had
engaged
had
to
be
dismissed
without
performing
the
service
for
which
they
had
come
kent
mckibben
and
taylor
lord
very
well
aware
of
the
rumors
now
flying
about
called
but
in
a
remote
and
troubled
spirit
aileen
saw
that
too
an
affair
of
this
kind
with
only
these
two
and
webster
israels
and
henry
huddlestone
calling
was
a
sad
indication
of
something
wrong
she
had
to
plead
illness
and
excuse
herself
the
third
week
fearing
a
worse
defeat
than
before
aileen
pretended
to
be
she
would
see
how
many
cards
were
left
there
were
just
three
that
was
the
end
she
realized
that
her
at
homes
were
a
notable
failure
at
the
same
time
cowperwood
was
not
to
be
spared
his
share
in
the
distrust
and
social
opposition
which
was
now
rampant
his
first
inkling
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
came
in
connection
with
a
dinner
which
on
the
strength
of
an
old
invitation
they
unfortunately
attended
at
a
time
when
aileen
was
still
uncertain
it
had
been
originally
arranged
by
the
sunderland
sledds
who
were
not
so
much
socially
and
who
at
the
time
it
occurred
were
as
yet
unaware
of
the
ugly
gossip
going
about
or
at
least
of
society
new
attitude
toward
the
cowperwoods
at
this
time
it
was
understood
by
nearly
all
the
simms
candas
cottons
and
kingslands
that
a
great
mistake
had
been
made
and
that
the
cowperwoods
were
by
no
means
admissible
to
this
particular
dinner
a
number
of
people
whom
the
latter
knew
had
been
invited
uniformly
all
when
they
learned
or
recalled
that
the
cowperwoods
were
expected
sent
regrets
so
sorry
outside
the
sledds
there
was
only
one
other
couple
the
stanislau
hoecksemas
for
whom
the
cowperwoods
did
not
particularly
care
it
was
a
dull
evening
aileen
complained
of
a
headache
and
they
went
home
very
shortly
afterward
at
a
reception
given
by
their
neighbors
the
haatstaedts
to
which
they
had
long
since
been
invited
there
was
an
evident
shyness
in
regard
to
them
quite
new
in
its
aspect
although
the
hosts
themselves
were
still
friendly
enough
previous
to
this
when
strangers
of
prominence
had
been
present
at
an
affair
of
this
kind
they
were
glad
to
be
brought
over
to
the
cowperwoods
who
were
always
conspicuous
because
of
aileen
beauty
on
this
day
for
no
reason
obvious
to
aileen
or
cowperwood
although
both
suspected
introductions
were
almost
uniformly
refused
there
were
a
number
who
knew
them
and
who
talked
casually
but
the
general
tendency
on
the
part
of
all
was
to
steer
clear
of
them
cowperwood
sensed
the
difficulty
at
once
i
think
we
better
leave
early
he
remarked
to
aileen
after
a
little
while
this
is
very
interesting
they
returned
to
their
own
home
and
cowperwood
to
avoid
discussion
went
he
did
not
care
to
say
what
he
thought
of
this
as
yet
it
was
previous
to
a
reception
given
by
the
union
league
that
the
first
real
blow
was
struck
at
him
personally
and
that
in
a
roundabout
way
addison
talking
to
him
at
the
lake
national
bank
one
morning
had
said
quite
confidentially
and
out
of
a
clear
sky
i
want
to
tell
you
something
cowperwood
you
know
by
now
something
about
chicago
society
you
also
know
where
i
stand
in
regard
to
some
things
you
told
me
about
your
past
when
i
first
met
you
well
a
lot
of
talk
going
around
about
you
now
in
regard
to
all
that
and
these
two
clubs
to
which
you
and
i
belong
are
filled
with
a
lot
of
hypocrites
who
been
stirred
up
by
this
talk
of
conspiracy
in
the
papers
there
are
four
or
five
stockholders
of
the
old
companies
who
are
members
and
they
are
trying
to
drive
you
out
they
looked
up
that
story
you
told
me
and
they
talking
about
filing
charges
with
the
house
committees
at
both
places
now
nothing
can
come
of
it
in
either
case
they
been
talking
to
me
but
when
this
next
reception
comes
along
you
know
what
to
do
have
to
extend
you
an
invitation
but
they
wo
mean
it
cowperwood
understood
this
whole
thing
is
certain
to
blow
over
in
my
judgment
it
will
if
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
for
the
present
he
stared
at
cowperwood
in
a
friendly
way
the
latter
smiled
i
expected
something
like
this
judah
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
easily
i
expected
it
all
along
you
worry
about
me
i
know
all
about
this
i
seen
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
and
i
know
how
to
trim
my
sails
addison
reached
out
and
took
his
hand
but
do
resign
whatever
you
do
he
said
cautiously
that
would
be
a
confession
of
weakness
and
they
do
expect
you
to
i
would
want
you
to
stand
your
ground
this
whole
thing
will
blow
over
they
jealous
i
think
i
never
intended
to
replied
cowperwood
there
no
legitimate
charge
against
me
i
know
it
will
all
blow
over
if
i
given
time
enough
nevertheless
he
was
chagrined
to
think
that
he
should
be
subjected
to
such
a
conversation
as
this
with
any
one
similarly
in
other
ways
society
so
called
was
quite
able
to
enforce
its
mandates
and
conclusions
the
one
thing
that
cowperwood
most
resented
when
he
learned
of
it
much
later
was
a
snub
direct
given
to
aileen
at
the
door
of
the
norrie
simmses
she
called
there
only
to
be
told
that
simms
was
not
at
home
although
the
carriages
of
others
were
in
the
street
a
few
days
afterward
aileen
much
to
his
regret
and
astonishment
for
he
did
not
then
know
the
cause
actually
became
ill
if
it
had
not
been
for
cowperwood
eventual
financial
triumph
over
all
opposition
the
complete
routing
of
the
enemy
in
the
struggle
for
control
in
the
gas
situation
the
situation
would
have
been
hard
indeed
as
it
was
aileen
suffered
bitterly
she
felt
that
the
slight
was
principally
directed
at
her
and
would
remain
in
force
in
the
privacy
of
their
own
home
they
were
compelled
eventually
to
admit
the
one
to
the
other
that
their
house
of
cards
resplendent
and
forceful
looking
as
it
was
had
fallen
to
the
ground
personal
confidences
between
people
so
closely
united
are
really
the
most
trying
of
all
human
souls
are
constantly
trying
to
find
each
other
and
rarely
succeeding
you
know
he
finally
said
to
her
once
when
he
came
in
rather
unexpectedly
and
found
her
sick
in
bed
her
eyes
wet
and
her
maid
dismissed
for
the
day
i
understand
what
this
is
all
about
to
tell
you
the
truth
aileen
i
rather
expected
it
we
have
been
going
too
fast
you
and
i
we
have
been
pushing
this
matter
too
hard
now
i
do
like
to
see
you
taking
it
this
way
dear
this
battle
is
lost
why
i
thought
you
had
more
courage
than
this
let
me
tell
you
something
which
you
do
seem
to
remember
money
will
solve
all
this
sometime
i
winning
in
this
fight
right
now
and
i
win
in
others
they
are
coming
to
me
why
dearie
you
ought
to
despair
too
young
i
never
do
you
win
yet
we
can
adjust
this
matter
right
here
in
chicago
and
when
we
do
we
will
pay
up
a
lot
of
scores
at
the
same
time
we
rich
and
we
going
to
be
richer
that
will
settle
it
now
put
on
a
good
face
and
look
pleased
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
live
for
in
this
world
besides
society
get
up
now
and
dress
and
we
go
for
a
drive
and
dinner
you
have
me
yet
is
that
something
oh
yes
sighed
aileen
heavily
but
she
sank
back
again
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
cried
as
much
out
of
joy
over
the
consolation
he
offered
as
over
the
loss
she
had
endured
it
was
as
much
for
you
as
for
me
she
sighed
i
know
that
he
soothed
but
do
worry
about
it
now
you
will
come
out
all
right
we
both
will
come
get
up
nevertheless
he
was
sorry
to
see
her
yield
so
weakly
it
did
not
please
him
he
resolved
some
day
to
have
a
grim
adjustment
with
society
on
this
score
meanwhile
aileen
was
recovering
her
spirits
she
was
ashamed
of
her
weakness
when
she
saw
how
forcefully
he
faced
it
all
oh
frank
she
exclaimed
finally
you
always
so
wonderful
you
such
a
darling
never
mind
he
said
cheerfully
if
we
do
win
this
game
here
in
chicago
we
will
somewhere
he
was
thinking
of
the
brilliant
manner
in
which
he
had
adjusted
his
affairs
with
the
old
gas
companies
and
schryhart
and
how
thoroughly
he
would
handle
some
other
matters
when
the
time
came
chapter
xiv
undercurrents
it
was
during
the
year
that
followed
their
social
repudiation
and
the
next
and
the
next
that
cowperwood
achieved
a
keen
realization
of
what
it
would
mean
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
social
isolation
or
at
least
confined
in
his
sources
of
entertainment
to
a
circle
or
element
which
constantly
reminded
him
of
the
fact
that
he
was
not
identified
with
the
best
or
at
least
not
the
most
significant
however
dull
that
might
be
when
he
had
first
attempted
to
introduce
aileen
into
society
it
was
his
idea
that
however
tame
they
might
chance
to
find
it
to
begin
with
they
themselves
once
admitted
could
make
it
into
something
very
interesting
and
even
brilliant
since
the
time
the
cowperwoods
had
been
repudiated
however
they
had
found
it
necessary
if
they
wished
any
social
diversion
at
all
to
fall
back
upon
such
various
minor
elements
as
they
could
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
passing
actors
and
actresses
to
whom
occasionally
they
could
give
a
dinner
artists
and
singers
whom
they
could
invite
to
the
house
upon
gaining
an
introduction
and
of
course
a
number
of
the
socially
unimportant
such
as
the
haatstaedts
hoecksemas
videras
baileys
and
others
still
friendly
and
willing
to
come
in
a
casual
way
cowperwood
found
it
interesting
from
time
to
time
to
invite
a
business
friend
a
lover
of
pictures
or
some
young
artist
to
the
house
to
dinner
or
for
the
evening
and
on
these
occasions
aileen
was
always
present
the
addisons
called
or
invited
them
occasionally
but
it
was
a
dull
game
the
more
so
since
their
complete
defeat
was
thus
all
the
more
plainly
indicated
this
defeat
as
cowperwood
kept
reflecting
was
really
not
his
fault
at
all
he
had
been
getting
along
well
enough
personally
if
aileen
had
only
been
a
somewhat
different
type
of
woman
nevertheless
he
was
in
no
way
prepared
to
desert
or
reproach
her
she
had
clung
to
him
through
his
stormy
prison
days
she
had
encouraged
him
when
he
needed
encouragement
he
would
stand
by
her
and
see
what
could
be
done
a
little
later
but
this
ostracism
was
a
rather
dreary
thing
to
endure
besides
personally
he
appeared
to
be
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
to
men
and
to
women
the
men
friends
he
had
made
he
retained
addison
bailey
videra
mckibben
rambaud
and
others
there
were
women
in
society
a
number
of
them
who
regretted
his
disappearance
if
not
that
of
aileen
occasionally
the
experiment
would
be
tried
of
inviting
him
without
his
wife
at
first
he
refused
invariably
later
he
went
alone
occasionally
to
a
without
her
knowledge
it
was
during
this
interregnum
that
cowperwood
for
the
first
time
clearly
began
to
get
the
idea
that
there
was
a
marked
difference
between
him
and
aileen
intellectually
and
spiritually
and
that
while
he
might
be
in
accord
with
her
in
many
ways
emotionally
physically
idyllicly
there
were
nevertheless
many
things
which
he
could
do
alone
which
she
could
not
do
heights
to
which
he
could
rise
where
she
could
not
possibly
follow
chicago
society
might
be
a
negligible
quantity
but
he
was
now
to
contrast
her
sharply
with
the
best
of
what
the
old
world
had
to
offer
in
the
matter
of
femininity
for
following
their
social
expulsion
in
chicago
and
his
financial
victory
he
once
more
decided
to
go
abroad
in
rome
at
the
japanese
and
brazilian
embassies
where
because
of
his
wealth
he
gained
introduction
and
at
the
newly
established
italian
court
he
encountered
at
a
distance
charming
social
figures
of
considerable
significance
italian
countesses
english
ladies
of
high
degree
talented
american
women
of
strong
artistic
and
social
proclivities
as
a
rule
they
were
quick
to
recognize
the
charm
of
his
manner
the
incisiveness
and
grip
of
his
mind
and
to
estimate
at
all
its
worth
the
high
individuality
of
his
soul
but
he
could
also
always
see
that
aileen
was
not
so
acceptable
she
was
too
rich
in
her
entourage
too
showy
her
glowing
health
and
beauty
was
a
species
of
affront
to
the
paler
more
sublimated
souls
of
many
who
were
not
in
themselves
unattractive
is
that
the
typical
american
for
you
he
heard
a
woman
remark
at
one
of
those
large
very
general
court
receptions
to
which
so
many
are
freely
admitted
and
to
which
aileen
had
been
determined
to
go
he
was
standing
aside
talking
to
an
acquaintance
he
had
made
an
greek
banker
stopping
at
the
grand
hotel
while
aileen
promenaded
with
the
banker
wife
the
speaker
was
an
englishwoman
so
gaudy
so
and
so
naive
cowperwood
turned
to
look
it
was
aileen
and
the
lady
speaking
was
undoubtedly
well
bred
thoughtful
he
had
to
admit
that
much
that
she
said
was
true
but
how
were
you
to
gage
a
woman
like
aileen
anyhow
she
was
not
reprehensible
in
any
way
just
a
animal
glowing
with
a
love
of
life
she
was
attractive
to
him
it
was
too
bad
that
people
of
obviously
more
conservative
tendencies
were
so
opposed
to
her
why
could
they
not
see
what
he
saw
a
kind
of
childish
enthusiasm
for
luxury
and
show
which
sprang
perhaps
from
the
fact
that
in
her
youth
she
had
not
enjoyed
the
social
opportunities
which
she
needed
and
longed
for
he
felt
sorry
for
her
at
the
same
time
he
was
inclined
to
feel
that
perhaps
now
another
type
of
woman
would
be
better
for
him
socially
if
he
had
a
harder
type
one
with
keener
artistic
perceptions
and
a
penchant
for
just
the
right
social
touch
or
note
how
much
better
he
would
do
he
came
home
bringing
a
perugino
brilliant
examples
of
luini
previtali
and
pinturrichio
this
last
a
portrait
of
caesar
borgia
which
he
picked
up
in
italy
to
say
nothing
of
two
red
african
vases
of
great
size
that
he
found
in
cairo
a
tall
gilt
louis
fifteenth
standard
of
carved
wood
that
he
discovered
in
rome
two
ornate
candelabra
from
venice
for
his
walls
and
a
pair
of
italian
torcheras
from
naples
to
decorate
the
corners
of
his
library
it
was
thus
by
degrees
that
his
art
collection
was
growing
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
said
in
the
matter
of
women
and
the
sex
question
his
judgment
and
views
had
begun
to
change
tremendously
when
he
had
first
met
aileen
he
had
many
keen
intuitions
regarding
life
and
sex
and
above
all
clear
faith
that
he
had
a
right
to
do
as
he
pleased
since
he
had
been
out
of
prison
and
once
more
on
his
upward
way
there
had
been
many
a
stray
glance
cast
in
his
direction
he
had
so
often
had
it
clearly
forced
upon
him
that
he
was
fascinating
to
women
although
he
had
only
so
recently
acquired
aileen
legally
yet
she
was
years
old
to
him
as
a
mistress
and
the
first
engrossing
it
had
been
almost
enthusiasm
was
over
he
loved
her
not
only
for
her
beauty
but
for
her
faithful
enthusiasm
but
the
power
of
others
to
provoke
in
him
a
momentary
interest
and
passion
even
was
something
which
he
did
not
pretend
to
understand
explain
or
moralize
about
so
it
was
and
so
he
was
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
aileen
feelings
by
letting
her
know
that
his
impulses
thus
wantonly
strayed
to
others
but
so
it
was
not
long
after
he
had
returned
from
the
european
trip
he
stopped
one
afternoon
in
the
one
exclusive
drygoods
store
in
state
street
to
purchase
a
tie
as
he
was
entering
a
woman
crossed
the
aisle
before
him
from
one
counter
to
another
a
type
of
woman
which
he
was
coming
to
admire
but
only
from
a
rather
distant
point
of
view
seeing
them
going
here
and
there
in
the
world
she
was
a
dashing
type
essentially
smart
and
trig
with
a
neat
figure
dark
hair
and
eyes
an
olive
skin
small
mouth
quaint
nose
all
in
all
quite
a
figure
for
chicago
at
the
time
she
had
furthermore
a
curious
look
of
current
wisdom
in
her
eyes
an
air
of
saucy
insolence
which
aroused
cowperwood
sense
of
mastery
his
desire
to
dominate
to
the
look
of
provocation
and
defiance
which
she
flung
him
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
returned
a
curiously
leonine
glare
which
went
over
her
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
it
was
not
a
hard
look
however
merely
urgent
and
full
of
meaning
she
was
the
wife
of
a
prosperous
lawyer
who
was
absorbed
in
his
business
and
in
himself
she
pretended
indifference
for
a
moment
after
the
first
glance
but
paused
a
little
way
off
as
if
to
examine
some
laces
cowperwood
looked
after
her
to
catch
a
second
fleeting
attracted
look
he
was
on
his
way
to
several
engagements
which
he
did
not
wish
to
break
but
he
took
out
a
wrote
on
a
slip
of
paper
the
name
of
a
hotel
and
underneath
parlor
second
floor
tuesday
passing
by
where
she
stood
he
put
it
into
her
gloved
hand
which
was
hanging
by
her
side
the
fingers
closed
over
it
automatically
she
had
noted
his
action
on
the
day
and
hour
suggested
she
was
there
although
he
had
given
no
name
that
liaison
while
delightful
to
him
was
of
no
great
duration
the
lady
was
interesting
but
too
fanciful
similarly
at
the
henry
huddlestones
one
of
their
neighbors
at
the
first
michigan
avenue
house
they
occupied
he
encountered
one
evening
at
a
small
a
girl
of
who
interested
him
greatly
for
the
moment
her
name
was
not
very
attractive
ella
hubby
as
he
eventually
learned
but
she
was
not
unpleasing
her
principal
charm
was
a
laughing
hoydenish
countenance
and
roguish
eyes
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
commission
merchant
in
south
water
street
that
her
interest
should
have
been
aroused
by
that
of
cowperwood
in
her
was
natural
enough
she
was
young
foolish
impressionable
easily
struck
by
the
glitter
of
a
reputation
and
huddlestone
had
spoken
highly
of
cowperwood
and
his
wife
and
the
great
things
he
was
doing
or
was
going
to
do
when
ella
saw
him
and
saw
that
he
was
still
with
the
love
of
beauty
in
his
eyes
and
a
force
of
presence
which
was
not
at
all
hard
where
she
was
concerned
she
was
charmed
and
when
aileen
was
not
looking
her
glance
kept
constantly
wandering
to
his
with
a
laughing
signification
of
friendship
and
admiration
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
say
to
her
when
they
had
adjourned
to
the
that
if
she
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
office
some
day
she
might
care
to
look
in
on
him
the
look
he
gave
her
was
one
of
keen
understanding
and
brought
a
look
of
its
own
kind
warm
and
flushing
in
return
she
came
and
there
began
a
rather
short
liaison
it
was
interesting
but
not
brilliant
the
girl
did
not
have
sufficient
temperament
to
bind
him
beyond
a
period
of
rather
idle
investigation
there
was
still
for
a
little
while
another
woman
whom
he
had
known
a
josephine
ledwell
a
smart
widow
who
came
primarily
to
gamble
on
the
board
of
trade
but
who
began
to
see
at
once
on
introduction
the
charm
of
a
flirtation
with
cowperwood
she
was
a
woman
not
unlike
aileen
in
type
a
little
older
not
so
and
of
a
harder
more
subtle
commercial
type
of
mind
she
rather
interested
cowperwood
because
she
was
so
trig
and
careful
she
did
her
best
to
lure
him
on
to
a
liaison
with
her
which
finally
resulted
her
apartment
on
the
north
side
being
the
center
of
this
relationship
it
lasted
perhaps
six
weeks
through
it
all
he
was
quite
satisfied
that
he
did
not
like
her
so
very
well
any
one
who
associated
with
him
had
aileen
present
attractiveness
to
contend
with
as
well
as
the
original
charm
of
his
first
wife
it
was
no
easy
matter
it
was
during
this
period
of
social
dullness
however
which
somewhat
resembled
though
it
did
not
exactly
parallel
his
first
years
with
his
first
wife
that
cowperwood
finally
met
a
woman
who
was
destined
to
leave
a
marked
impression
on
his
life
he
could
not
soon
forget
her
her
name
was
rita
sohlberg
she
was
the
wife
of
harold
sohlberg
a
danish
violinist
who
was
then
living
in
chicago
a
very
young
man
but
she
was
not
a
dane
and
he
was
by
no
means
a
remarkable
violinist
though
he
had
unquestionably
the
musical
temperament
you
have
perhaps
seen
the
the
nearly
the
pretenders
in
every
field
interesting
people
all
devoted
with
a
kind
of
mad
enthusiasm
to
the
thing
they
wish
to
do
they
manifest
in
some
ways
all
the
externals
or
earmarks
of
their
professional
traditions
and
yet
are
as
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbals
you
would
have
had
to
know
harold
sohlberg
only
a
little
while
to
appreciate
that
he
belonged
to
this
order
of
artists
he
had
a
wild
stormy
november
eye
a
wealth
of
loose
hair
combed
upward
from
the
temples
with
one
lock
straggling
napoleonically
down
toward
the
eyes
cheeks
that
had
almost
a
babyish
tint
to
them
lips
much
too
rich
red
and
sensuous
a
nose
that
was
fine
and
large
and
full
but
only
faintly
aquiline
and
eyebrows
and
mustache
that
somehow
seemed
to
flare
quite
like
his
errant
and
foolish
soul
he
had
been
sent
away
from
denmark
copenhagen
because
he
had
been
a
up
to
and
because
he
was
constantly
falling
in
love
with
women
who
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
him
here
in
chicago
as
a
teacher
with
his
small
pension
of
forty
dollars
a
month
sent
him
by
his
mother
he
had
gained
a
few
pupils
and
by
practising
a
kind
of
erratic
economy
which
kept
him
well
dressed
or
hungry
by
turns
he
had
managed
to
make
an
interesting
showing
and
pull
himself
through
he
was
only
at
the
time
he
met
rita
greenough
of
wichita
kansas
and
at
the
time
they
met
cowperwood
harold
was
and
she
she
had
been
a
student
at
the
chicago
fine
arts
school
and
at
various
student
affairs
had
encountered
harold
when
he
seemed
to
play
divinely
and
when
life
was
all
romance
and
art
given
the
spring
the
sunshine
on
the
lake
white
sails
of
ships
a
few
walks
and
talks
on
pensive
afternoons
when
the
city
swam
in
a
golden
haze
and
the
thing
was
done
there
was
a
sudden
saturday
afternoon
marriage
a
runaway
day
to
milwaukee
a
return
to
the
studio
now
to
be
fitted
out
for
two
and
then
kisses
kisses
kisses
until
love
was
satisfied
or
eased
but
life
can
not
exist
on
that
diet
alone
and
so
by
degrees
the
difficulties
had
begun
to
manifest
themselves
fortunately
the
latter
were
not
allied
with
sharp
financial
want
rita
was
not
poor
her
father
conducted
a
small
but
profitable
grain
elevator
at
wichita
and
after
her
sudden
marriage
decided
to
continue
her
allowance
though
this
whole
idea
of
art
and
music
in
its
upper
reaches
was
to
him
a
strange
uncertain
thing
a
thin
meticulous
genial
person
interested
in
small
trade
opportunities
and
exactly
suited
to
the
rather
sparse
social
life
of
wichita
he
found
harold
as
curious
as
a
bomb
and
preferred
to
handle
him
gingerly
gradually
however
being
a
very
human
if
simple
person
he
came
to
be
very
proud
of
it
boasted
in
wichita
of
rita
and
her
artist
husband
invited
them
home
to
astound
the
neighbors
during
the
and
the
fall
brought
his
almost
wife
on
to
see
them
and
to
enjoy
trips
studio
teas
it
was
amusing
typically
american
naive
almost
impossible
from
many
points
of
view
rita
sohlberg
was
of
the
type
soft
with
a
body
that
was
going
to
be
fat
at
forty
but
which
at
present
was
deliciously
alluring
having
soft
silky
hair
the
color
of
light
dust
and
moist
eyes
with
a
fair
skin
and
even
white
teeth
she
was
flatteringly
of
her
charms
she
pretended
in
a
gay
childlike
way
to
be
unconscious
of
the
thrill
she
sent
through
many
susceptible
males
and
yet
she
knew
well
enough
all
the
while
what
she
was
doing
and
how
she
was
doing
it
it
pleased
her
so
to
do
she
was
conscious
of
the
wonder
of
her
smooth
soft
arms
and
neck
the
fullness
and
seductiveness
of
her
body
the
grace
and
perfection
of
her
clothing
or
at
least
the
individuality
and
taste
which
she
made
them
indicate
she
could
take
an
old
form
a
ribbon
a
feather
or
a
rose
and
with
an
innate
artistry
of
feeling
turn
it
into
a
bit
of
millinery
which
somehow
was
just
the
effective
thing
for
her
she
chose
naive
combinations
of
white
and
blues
pinks
and
white
browns
and
pale
yellows
which
somehow
suggested
her
own
soul
and
topped
them
with
great
sashes
of
silky
brown
or
even
red
ribbon
tied
about
her
waist
and
large
hats
she
was
a
graceful
dancer
could
sing
a
little
could
play
feelingly
sometimes
brilliantly
and
could
draw
her
art
was
a
makeshift
however
she
was
no
artist
the
most
significant
thing
about
her
was
her
moods
and
her
thoughts
which
were
uncertain
casual
anarchic
rita
sohlberg
from
the
conventional
point
of
view
was
a
dangerous
person
and
yet
from
her
own
point
of
view
at
this
time
she
was
not
so
at
all
just
dreamy
and
sweet
a
part
of
the
peculiarity
of
her
state
was
that
sohlberg
had
begun
to
disappoint
rita
sorely
truth
to
tell
he
was
suffering
from
that
most
terrible
of
all
maladies
uncertainty
of
soul
and
inability
to
truly
find
himself
at
times
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
was
cut
out
to
be
a
great
violinist
or
a
great
composer
or
merely
a
great
teacher
which
last
he
was
never
willing
really
to
admit
i
am
an
arteest
he
was
fond
of
saying
ho
how
i
suffer
from
my
temperament
and
again
these
dogs
these
cows
these
pigs
this
of
other
people
the
quality
of
his
playing
was
exceedingly
erratic
even
though
at
times
it
attained
to
a
kind
of
subtlety
tenderness
awareness
and
charm
which
brought
him
some
attention
as
a
rule
however
it
reflected
the
chaotic
state
of
his
own
brain
he
would
play
violently
feverishly
with
a
wild
passionateness
of
gesture
which
robbed
him
of
all
ability
to
control
his
own
technic
oh
harold
rita
used
to
exclaim
at
first
ecstatically
later
she
was
not
so
sure
life
and
character
must
really
get
somewhere
to
be
admirable
and
harold
really
and
truly
did
not
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
he
taught
stormed
dreamed
wept
but
he
ate
his
three
meals
a
day
rita
noticed
and
he
took
an
excited
interest
at
times
in
other
women
to
be
the
and
of
some
one
man
life
was
the
least
that
rita
could
conceive
or
concede
as
the
worth
of
her
personality
and
so
as
the
years
went
on
and
harold
began
to
be
unfaithful
first
in
moods
transports
then
in
deeds
her
mood
became
dangerous
she
counted
them
up
a
girl
music
pupil
then
an
art
student
then
the
wife
of
a
banker
at
whose
house
harold
played
socially
there
followed
strange
sullen
moods
on
the
part
of
rita
visits
home
groveling
repentances
on
the
part
of
harold
tears
violent
passionate
reunions
and
then
the
same
thing
over
again
what
would
you
rita
was
not
jealous
of
harold
any
more
she
had
lost
faith
in
his
ability
as
a
musician
but
she
was
disappointed
that
her
charms
were
not
sufficient
to
blind
him
to
all
others
that
was
the
fly
in
the
ointment
it
was
an
affront
to
her
beauty
and
she
was
still
beautiful
she
was
unctuously
not
quite
so
tall
as
aileen
not
really
as
large
but
rounder
and
plumper
softer
and
more
seductive
physically
she
was
not
well
set
up
so
vigorous
but
her
eyes
and
mouth
and
the
roving
character
of
her
mind
held
a
strange
lure
mentally
she
was
much
more
aware
than
aileen
much
more
precise
in
her
knowledge
of
art
music
literature
and
current
events
and
in
the
field
of
romance
she
was
much
more
vague
and
alluring
she
knew
many
things
about
flowers
precious
stones
insects
birds
characters
in
fiction
and
poetic
prose
and
verse
generally
at
the
time
the
cowperwoods
first
met
the
sohlbergs
the
latter
still
had
their
studio
in
the
new
arts
building
and
all
was
seemingly
as
serene
as
a
may
morning
only
harold
was
not
getting
along
very
well
he
was
drifting
the
meeting
was
at
a
tea
given
by
the
haatstaedts
with
whom
the
cowperwoods
were
still
friendly
and
harold
played
aileen
who
was
there
alone
seeing
a
chance
to
brighten
her
own
life
a
little
invited
the
sohlbergs
who
seemed
rather
above
the
average
to
her
house
to
a
musical
evening
they
came
on
this
occasion
cowperwood
took
one
look
at
sohlberg
and
placed
him
exactly
an
erratic
emotional
temperament
he
thought
probably
not
able
to
place
himself
for
want
of
consistency
and
application
but
he
liked
him
after
a
fashion
sohlberg
was
interesting
as
an
artistic
type
or
figure
quite
like
a
character
in
a
japanese
print
might
be
he
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
sohlberg
i
suppose
he
remarked
feelingly
catching
a
quick
suggestion
of
the
rhythm
and
sufficiency
and
naive
taste
that
went
with
her
she
was
in
simple
white
and
blue
small
blue
ribbons
threaded
above
lacy
flounces
in
the
skin
her
arms
and
throat
were
deliciously
soft
and
bare
her
eyes
were
quick
and
yet
soft
and
babyish
petted
eyes
you
know
she
said
to
him
with
a
peculiar
rounded
formation
of
the
mouth
which
was
a
characteristic
of
her
when
she
talked
a
pretty
pouty
mouth
i
thought
we
would
never
get
heah
at
all
there
was
a
fire
she
pronounced
it
at
twelfth
street
the
twelfth
was
twalfth
in
her
mouth
and
the
engines
were
all
about
there
oh
such
sparks
and
smoke
and
the
flames
coming
out
of
the
windows
the
flames
were
a
very
dark
red
almost
orange
and
black
they
pretty
when
they
that
way
do
you
think
so
cowperwood
was
charmed
indeed
i
do
he
said
genially
using
a
kind
of
superior
and
yet
sympathetic
air
which
he
could
easily
assume
on
occasion
he
felt
as
though
sohlberg
might
be
a
charming
daughter
to
him
she
was
so
cuddling
and
shy
and
yet
he
could
see
that
she
was
definite
and
individual
her
arms
and
face
he
told
himself
were
lovely
sohlberg
only
saw
before
her
a
smart
cold
exact
man
capable
very
she
presumed
with
brilliant
incisive
eyes
how
different
from
harold
she
thought
who
would
never
be
anything
much
not
even
famous
i
so
glad
you
brought
your
violin
aileen
was
saying
to
harold
who
was
in
another
corner
i
been
looking
forward
to
your
coming
to
play
for
us
very
nize
ov
you
i
sure
sohlberg
replied
with
his
sweety
drawl
such
a
nize
plaze
you
have
here
all
these
loafly
books
and
jade
and
glass
he
had
an
unctuous
yielding
way
which
was
charming
aileen
thought
he
should
have
a
strong
rich
woman
to
take
care
of
him
he
was
like
a
stormy
erratic
boy
after
refreshments
were
served
sohlberg
played
cowperwood
was
interested
by
his
standing
figure
his
eyes
his
hair
but
he
was
much
more
interested
in
sohlberg
to
whom
his
look
constantly
strayed
he
watched
her
hands
on
the
keys
her
fingers
the
dimples
at
her
elbows
what
an
adorable
mouth
he
thought
and
what
light
fluffy
hair
but
more
than
that
there
was
a
mood
that
invested
it
all
a
bit
of
tinted
color
of
the
mind
that
reached
him
and
made
him
sympathetic
and
even
passionate
toward
her
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
he
would
like
she
was
somewhat
like
aileen
when
she
was
six
years
younger
aileen
was
now
and
sohlberg
only
aileen
had
always
been
more
robust
more
vigorous
less
nebulous
sohlberg
he
finally
thought
it
out
for
himself
was
like
the
rich
tinted
interior
of
a
south
sea
warm
colorful
delicate
but
there
was
something
firm
there
too
nowhere
in
society
had
he
seen
any
one
like
her
she
was
rapt
sensuous
beautiful
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
until
finally
she
became
aware
that
he
was
gazing
at
her
and
then
she
looked
back
at
him
in
an
arch
smiling
way
fixing
her
mouth
in
a
potent
line
cowperwood
was
captivated
was
she
vulnerable
was
his
one
thought
did
that
faint
smile
mean
anything
more
than
mere
social
complaisance
probably
not
but
could
not
a
temperament
so
rich
and
full
be
awakened
to
feeling
by
his
own
when
she
was
through
playing
he
took
occasion
to
say
would
you
like
to
stroll
into
the
gallery
are
you
fond
of
pictures
he
gave
her
his
arm
now
you
know
said
sohlberg
quaintly
very
captivatingly
he
thought
because
she
was
so
pretty
at
one
time
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
a
great
artist
is
that
funny
i
sent
my
father
one
of
my
drawings
inscribed
whom
i
owe
it
all
you
would
have
to
see
the
drawing
to
see
how
funny
that
is
she
laughed
softly
cowperwood
responded
with
a
refreshed
interest
in
life
her
laugh
was
as
grateful
to
him
as
a
summer
wind
see
he
said
gently
as
they
entered
the
room
aglow
with
the
soft
light
produced
by
guttered
jets
here
is
a
luini
bought
last
winter
it
was
the
mystic
marriage
of
st
catharine
he
paused
while
she
surveyed
the
rapt
expression
of
the
attenuated
saint
and
here
he
went
on
is
my
greatest
find
so
far
they
were
before
the
crafty
countenance
of
caesar
borgia
painted
by
pinturrichio
what
a
strange
face
commented
sohlberg
naively
i
know
any
one
had
ever
painted
him
he
looks
somewhat
like
an
artist
himself
does
he
she
had
never
read
the
involved
and
quite
satanic
history
of
this
man
and
only
knew
the
rumor
of
his
crimes
and
machinations
he
was
in
his
way
smiled
cowperwood
who
had
had
an
outline
of
his
life
and
that
of
his
father
pope
alexander
furnished
him
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
only
so
recently
had
his
interest
in
caesar
borgia
begun
sohlberg
scarcely
gathered
the
sly
humor
of
it
oh
yes
and
here
is
cowperwood
she
commented
turning
to
the
painting
by
van
beers
it
high
in
key
is
it
she
said
loftily
but
with
an
innocent
loftiness
that
appealed
to
him
he
liked
spirit
and
some
presumption
in
a
woman
what
brilliant
colors
i
like
the
idea
of
the
garden
and
the
clouds
she
stepped
back
and
cowperwood
interested
only
in
her
surveyed
the
line
of
her
back
and
the
profile
of
her
face
such
perfection
of
line
and
color
where
every
motion
weaves
and
sings
he
might
have
commented
instead
he
said
that
was
in
brussels
the
clouds
were
an
afterthought
and
that
vase
on
the
wall
too
it
very
good
i
think
commented
sohlberg
and
moved
away
how
do
you
like
this
israels
he
asked
it
was
the
painting
called
the
frugal
meal
i
like
it
she
said
and
also
your
bastien
referring
to
the
forge
but
i
think
your
old
masters
are
much
more
interesting
if
you
get
many
more
you
ought
to
put
them
together
in
a
room
you
think
so
i
do
care
for
your
gerome
very
much
she
had
a
cute
drawl
which
he
considered
infinitely
alluring
why
not
asked
cowperwood
oh
it
rather
artificial
do
you
think
so
i
like
the
color
but
the
women
bodies
are
too
perfect
i
should
say
it
very
pretty
though
he
had
little
faith
in
the
ability
of
women
aside
from
their
value
as
objects
of
art
and
yet
now
and
then
as
in
this
instance
they
revealed
a
sweet
insight
which
sharpened
his
own
aileen
he
reflected
would
not
be
capable
of
making
a
remark
such
as
this
she
was
not
as
beautiful
now
as
this
woman
not
as
alluringly
simple
naive
delicious
nor
yet
as
wise
sohlberg
he
reflected
shrewdly
had
a
kind
of
fool
for
a
husband
would
she
take
an
interest
in
him
frank
cowperwood
would
a
woman
like
this
surrender
on
any
basis
outside
of
divorce
and
marriage
he
wondered
on
her
part
sohlberg
was
thinking
what
a
forceful
man
cowperwood
was
and
how
close
he
had
stayed
by
her
she
felt
his
interest
for
she
had
often
seen
these
symptoms
in
other
men
and
knew
what
they
meant
she
knew
the
pull
of
her
own
beauty
and
while
she
heightened
it
as
artfully
as
she
dared
yet
she
kept
aloof
too
feeling
that
she
had
never
met
any
one
as
yet
for
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
be
different
but
cowperwood
he
needed
someone
more
soulful
than
aileen
she
thought
chapter
xv
a
new
affection
the
growth
of
a
relationship
between
cowperwood
and
rita
sohlberg
was
fostered
quite
accidentally
by
aileen
who
took
a
foolishly
sentimental
interest
in
harold
which
yet
was
not
based
on
anything
of
real
meaning
she
liked
him
because
he
was
a
superlatively
gracious
flattering
emotional
man
where
women
pretty
women
were
concerned
she
had
some
idea
she
could
send
him
pupils
and
anyhow
it
was
nice
to
call
at
the
sohlberg
studio
her
social
life
was
dull
enough
as
it
was
so
she
went
and
cowperwood
mindful
of
sohlberg
came
also
shrewd
to
the
point
of
destruction
he
encouraged
aileen
in
her
interest
in
them
he
suggested
that
she
invite
them
to
dinner
that
they
give
a
musical
at
which
sohlberg
could
play
and
be
paid
there
were
boxes
at
the
theaters
tickets
for
concerts
sent
invitations
to
drive
sundays
or
other
days
the
very
chemistry
of
life
seems
to
play
into
the
hands
of
a
situation
of
this
kind
once
cowperwood
was
thinking
vividly
forcefully
of
her
rita
began
to
think
in
like
manner
of
him
hourly
he
grew
more
attractive
a
strange
gripping
man
beset
by
his
mood
she
was
having
the
devil
own
time
with
her
conscience
not
that
anything
had
been
said
as
yet
but
he
was
investing
her
gradually
beleaguering
her
sealing
up
apparently
one
avenue
after
another
of
escape
one
thursday
afternoon
when
neither
aileen
nor
he
could
attend
the
sohlberg
tea
sohlberg
received
a
magnificent
bunch
of
jacqueminot
roses
for
your
nooks
and
corners
said
a
card
she
knew
well
enough
from
whom
it
came
and
what
it
was
worth
there
were
all
of
fifty
dollars
worth
of
roses
it
gave
her
breath
of
a
world
of
money
that
she
had
never
known
daily
she
saw
the
name
of
his
banking
and
brokerage
firm
advertised
in
the
papers
once
she
met
him
in
store
at
noon
and
he
invited
her
to
lunch
but
she
felt
obliged
to
decline
always
he
looked
at
her
with
such
straight
vigorous
eyes
to
think
that
her
beauty
had
done
or
was
doing
this
her
mind
quite
beyond
herself
ran
forward
to
an
hour
when
perhaps
this
eager
magnetic
man
would
take
charge
of
her
in
a
way
never
dreamed
of
by
harold
but
she
went
on
practising
shopping
calling
reading
brooding
over
harold
inefficiency
and
stopping
oddly
sometimes
to
think
the
etherealized
grip
of
cowperwood
upon
her
those
strong
hands
of
his
how
fine
they
were
and
those
large
incisive
eyes
the
puritanism
of
wichita
modified
sometime
since
by
the
art
life
of
chicago
such
as
it
was
was
having
a
severe
struggle
with
the
manipulative
subtlety
of
the
ages
represented
in
this
man
you
know
you
are
very
elusive
he
said
to
her
one
evening
at
the
theater
when
he
sat
behind
her
during
the
and
harold
and
aileen
had
gone
to
walk
in
the
foyer
the
hubbub
of
conversation
drowned
the
sound
of
anything
that
might
be
said
sohlberg
was
particularly
pleasing
in
a
lacy
evening
gown
no
she
replied
amusedly
flattered
by
his
attention
and
acutely
conscious
of
his
physical
nearness
by
degrees
she
had
been
yielding
herself
to
his
mood
thrilling
at
his
every
word
it
seems
to
me
i
am
very
stable
she
went
on
i
certainly
substantial
enough
she
looked
at
her
full
smooth
arm
lying
on
her
lap
cowperwood
who
was
feeling
all
the
drag
of
her
substantiality
but
in
addition
the
wonder
of
her
temperament
which
was
so
much
richer
than
aileen
was
deeply
moved
those
little
blood
moods
that
no
words
ever
or
rarely
indicate
were
coming
to
him
from
her
faint
emanations
of
emotions
moods
and
fancies
in
her
mind
which
allured
him
she
was
like
aileen
in
animality
but
better
still
sweeter
more
delicate
much
richer
spiritually
or
was
he
just
tired
of
aileen
for
the
present
he
asked
himself
at
times
no
no
he
told
himself
that
could
not
be
rita
sohlberg
was
by
far
the
most
pleasing
woman
he
had
ever
known
yes
but
elusive
just
the
same
he
went
on
leaning
toward
her
you
remind
me
of
something
that
i
can
find
no
word
for
a
bit
of
color
or
a
perfume
or
tone
a
flash
of
something
i
follow
you
in
my
thoughts
all
the
time
now
your
knowledge
of
art
interests
me
i
like
your
playing
it
is
like
you
you
make
me
think
of
delightful
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
ordinary
run
of
my
life
do
you
understand
it
is
very
nice
she
said
if
i
do
she
took
a
breath
softly
dramatically
you
make
me
think
vain
things
you
know
her
mouth
was
a
delicious
o
you
paint
a
pretty
picture
she
was
warm
flushed
suffused
with
a
burst
of
her
own
temperament
you
are
like
that
he
went
on
insistently
you
make
me
feel
like
that
all
the
time
you
know
he
added
leaning
over
her
chair
i
sometimes
think
you
have
never
lived
there
is
so
much
that
would
complete
your
perfectness
i
should
like
to
send
you
abroad
or
take
you
anyhow
you
should
go
you
are
very
wonderful
to
me
do
you
find
me
at
all
interesting
to
you
yes
but
she
paused
you
know
i
am
afraid
of
all
this
and
of
you
her
mouth
had
that
same
delicious
formation
which
had
first
attracted
him
i
do
think
we
had
better
talk
like
this
do
you
harold
is
very
jealous
or
would
be
what
do
you
suppose
cowperwood
would
think
i
know
very
well
but
we
need
stop
to
consider
that
now
need
we
it
will
do
her
no
harm
to
let
me
talk
to
you
life
is
between
individuals
rita
you
and
i
have
very
much
in
common
do
you
see
that
you
are
infinitely
the
most
interesting
woman
i
have
ever
known
you
are
bringing
me
something
i
have
never
known
do
you
see
that
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
truly
look
at
me
you
are
not
happy
as
you
are
are
you
not
perfectly
happy
no
she
smoothed
her
fan
with
her
fingers
are
you
happy
at
all
i
thought
i
was
once
i
not
any
more
i
think
it
is
so
plain
why
he
commented
you
are
so
much
more
wonderful
than
your
place
gives
you
scope
for
you
are
an
individual
not
an
acolyte
to
swing
a
censer
for
another
sohlberg
is
very
interesting
but
you
ca
be
happy
that
way
it
surprises
me
you
have
seen
it
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
touch
of
weariness
but
perhaps
i
have
he
looked
at
her
keenly
and
she
thrilled
i
do
think
we
better
talk
so
here
she
replied
you
better
be
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
back
of
her
chair
almost
touching
her
shoulder
rita
he
said
using
her
given
name
again
you
wonderful
woman
oh
she
breathed
cowperwood
did
not
see
sohlberg
again
for
over
a
week
ten
days
exactly
when
one
afternoon
aileen
came
for
him
in
a
new
kind
of
trap
having
stopped
first
to
pick
up
the
sohlbergs
harold
was
up
in
front
with
her
and
she
had
left
a
place
behind
for
cowperwood
with
rita
she
did
not
in
the
vaguest
way
suspect
how
interested
he
was
his
manner
was
so
deceptive
aileen
imagined
that
she
was
the
superior
woman
of
the
two
the
the
hence
the
more
ensnaring
she
could
not
guess
what
a
lure
this
woman
temperament
had
for
cowperwood
who
was
so
brisk
dynamic
seemingly
unromantic
but
who
just
the
same
in
his
nature
concealed
under
a
very
forceful
exterior
a
deep
underlying
element
of
romance
and
fire
this
is
charming
he
said
sinking
down
beside
rita
what
a
fine
evening
and
the
nice
straw
hat
with
the
roses
and
the
nice
linen
dress
my
my
the
roses
were
red
the
dress
white
with
thin
green
ribbon
run
through
it
here
and
there
she
was
keenly
aware
of
the
reason
for
his
enthusiasm
he
was
so
different
from
harold
so
healthy
and
so
able
harold
had
been
in
tantrums
over
fate
life
his
lack
of
success
oh
i
should
complain
so
much
if
i
were
you
she
had
said
to
him
bitterly
you
might
work
harder
and
storm
less
this
had
produced
a
scene
which
she
had
escaped
by
going
for
a
walk
almost
at
the
very
moment
when
she
had
returned
aileen
had
appeared
it
was
a
way
out
she
had
cheered
up
and
accepted
dressed
so
had
sohlberg
apparently
smiling
and
happy
they
had
set
out
on
the
drive
now
as
cowperwood
spoke
she
glanced
about
her
contentedly
i
lovely
she
thought
and
he
loves
me
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
we
dared
but
she
said
aloud
i
not
so
very
nice
it
just
the
day
do
you
think
so
it
a
simple
dress
i
not
very
happy
though
either
what
the
matter
he
asked
cheeringly
the
rumble
of
the
traffic
destroying
the
of
their
voices
he
leaned
toward
her
very
anxious
to
solve
any
difficulty
which
might
confront
her
perfectly
willing
to
ensnare
her
by
kindness
is
there
something
i
can
do
we
going
now
for
a
long
ride
to
the
pavilion
in
jackson
park
and
then
after
dinner
we
come
back
by
moonlight
wo
that
be
nice
you
must
be
smiling
now
and
like
yourself
happy
you
have
no
reason
to
be
otherwise
that
i
know
of
i
will
do
anything
for
you
that
you
want
done
that
can
be
done
you
can
have
anything
you
want
that
i
can
give
you
what
is
it
you
know
how
much
i
think
of
you
if
you
leave
your
affairs
to
me
you
would
never
have
any
troubles
of
any
kind
oh
it
is
anything
you
can
do
not
now
anyhow
my
affairs
oh
yes
what
are
they
very
simple
all
she
had
that
delicious
atmosphere
of
remoteness
even
from
herself
he
was
enchanted
but
you
are
not
simple
to
me
rita
he
said
softly
nor
are
your
affairs
they
concern
me
very
much
you
are
so
important
to
me
i
have
told
you
that
do
you
see
how
true
it
is
you
are
a
strange
complexity
to
me
wonderful
i
mad
over
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
been
thinking
thinking
if
you
have
troubles
let
me
share
them
you
are
so
much
to
me
my
only
trouble
i
can
fix
your
life
join
it
with
mine
i
need
you
and
you
need
me
yes
she
said
i
know
then
she
paused
it
nothing
much
she
went
on
just
a
quarrel
what
over
over
me
really
the
mouth
was
delicious
i
ca
swing
the
censer
always
as
you
say
that
thought
of
his
had
stuck
it
all
right
now
though
is
the
day
lovely
cowperwood
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
she
was
such
a
treasure
so
inconsequential
aileen
busy
driving
and
talking
could
not
see
or
hear
she
was
interested
in
sohlberg
and
the
southward
crush
of
vehicles
on
michigan
avenue
was
distracting
her
attention
as
they
drove
swiftly
past
budding
trees
kempt
lawns
open
windows
the
whole
seductive
world
of
spring
cowperwood
felt
as
though
life
had
once
more
taken
a
fresh
start
his
magnetism
if
it
had
been
visible
would
have
enveloped
him
like
a
glittering
aura
sohlberg
felt
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
wonderful
evening
the
dinner
was
at
the
park
an
chicken
a
la
maryland
affair
with
waffles
and
champagne
to
help
out
aileen
flattered
by
sohlberg
gaiety
under
her
spell
was
having
a
delightful
time
jesting
toasting
laughing
walking
on
the
grass
sohlberg
was
making
love
to
her
in
a
foolish
inconsequential
way
as
many
men
were
inclined
to
do
but
she
was
putting
him
off
gaily
with
silly
boy
and
hush
she
was
so
sure
of
herself
that
she
was
free
to
tell
cowperwood
afterward
how
emotional
he
was
and
how
she
had
to
laugh
at
him
cowperwood
quite
certain
that
she
was
faithful
took
it
all
in
good
part
sohlberg
was
such
a
dunce
and
such
a
happy
convenience
ready
to
his
hand
he
not
a
bad
sort
he
commented
i
rather
like
him
though
i
do
think
he
so
much
of
a
violinist
after
dinner
they
drove
along
the
and
out
through
an
open
bit
of
prairie
land
the
moon
shining
in
a
clear
sky
filling
the
fields
and
topping
the
lake
with
a
silvery
effulgence
sohlberg
was
being
inoculated
with
the
virus
cowperwood
and
it
was
taking
deadly
effect
the
tendency
of
her
own
disposition
however
lethargic
it
might
seem
once
it
was
stirred
emotionally
was
to
act
she
was
essentially
dynamic
and
passionate
cowperwood
was
beginning
to
stand
out
in
her
mind
as
the
force
that
he
was
it
would
be
wonderful
to
be
loved
by
such
a
man
there
would
be
an
eager
vivid
life
between
them
it
frightened
and
drew
her
like
a
blazing
lamp
in
the
dark
to
get
control
of
herself
she
talked
of
art
people
of
paris
italy
and
he
responded
in
like
strain
but
all
the
while
he
smoothed
her
hand
and
once
under
the
shadow
of
some
trees
he
put
his
hand
to
her
hair
turned
her
face
and
put
his
mouth
softly
to
her
cheek
she
flushed
trembled
turned
pale
in
the
grip
of
this
strange
storm
but
drew
herself
together
it
was
wonderful
heaven
her
old
life
was
obviously
going
to
pieces
listen
he
said
guardedly
will
you
meet
me
at
three
just
beyond
the
rush
street
bridge
i
will
pick
you
up
promptly
you
wo
have
to
wait
a
moment
she
paused
meditating
dreaming
almost
hypnotized
by
his
strange
world
of
fancy
will
you
he
asked
eagerly
wait
she
said
softly
let
me
think
can
i
she
paused
yes
she
said
after
a
time
drawing
in
a
deep
breath
yes
as
if
she
had
arranged
something
in
her
mind
my
sweet
he
whispered
pressing
her
arm
while
he
looked
at
her
profile
in
the
moonlight
but
i
doing
a
great
deal
she
replied
softly
a
little
breathless
and
a
little
pale
chapter
xvi
a
fateful
interlude
cowperwood
was
enchanted
he
kept
the
proposed
tryst
with
eagerness
and
found
her
all
that
he
had
hoped
she
was
sweeter
more
colorful
more
elusive
than
anybody
he
had
ever
known
in
their
charming
apartment
on
the
north
side
which
he
at
once
engaged
and
where
he
sometimes
spent
mornings
evenings
afternoons
as
opportunity
afforded
he
studied
her
with
the
most
critical
eye
and
found
her
almost
flawless
she
had
that
boundless
value
which
youth
and
a
certain
insouciance
of
manner
contribute
there
was
delicious
to
relate
no
melancholy
in
her
nature
but
a
kind
of
innate
sufficiency
which
neither
looked
forward
to
nor
back
upon
troublesome
ills
she
loved
beautiful
things
but
was
not
extravagant
and
what
interested
him
and
commanded
his
respect
was
that
no
urgings
of
his
toward
prodigality
however
subtly
advanced
could
affect
her
she
knew
what
she
wanted
spent
carefully
bought
tastefully
arrayed
herself
in
ways
which
appealed
to
him
as
the
flowers
did
his
feeling
for
her
became
at
times
so
great
that
he
wished
one
might
almost
have
said
to
destroy
it
to
appease
the
urge
and
allay
the
pull
in
himself
but
it
was
useless
the
charm
of
her
endured
his
transports
would
leave
her
refreshed
apparently
prettier
more
graceful
than
ever
it
seemed
to
him
putting
back
her
ruffled
hair
with
her
hand
mouthing
at
herself
prettily
in
the
glass
thinking
of
many
remote
delicious
things
at
once
do
you
remember
that
picture
we
saw
in
the
art
store
the
other
day
algernon
she
would
drawl
calling
him
by
his
second
name
which
she
had
adopted
for
herself
as
being
more
suited
to
his
moods
when
with
her
and
more
pleasing
to
her
cowperwood
had
protested
but
she
held
to
it
do
you
remember
that
lovely
blue
of
the
old
man
coat
it
was
an
adoration
of
the
magi
was
that
she
drawled
so
sweetly
and
fixed
her
mouth
in
such
an
odd
way
that
he
was
impelled
to
kiss
her
you
clover
blossom
he
would
say
to
her
coming
over
and
taking
her
by
the
arms
you
sprig
of
cherry
bloom
you
dresden
china
dream
now
are
you
going
to
muss
my
hair
when
i
just
managed
to
fix
it
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
careless
genial
innocence
and
the
eyes
yes
i
am
minx
yes
but
you
must
smother
me
you
know
really
you
know
you
almost
hurt
me
with
your
mouth
are
you
going
to
be
nice
to
me
yes
sweet
but
i
want
to
hurt
you
too
well
then
if
you
must
but
for
all
his
transports
the
lure
was
still
there
she
was
like
a
butterfly
he
thought
yellow
and
white
or
blue
and
gold
fluttering
over
a
hedge
of
wild
rose
in
these
intimacies
it
was
that
he
came
quickly
to
understand
how
much
she
knew
of
social
movements
and
tendencies
though
she
was
just
an
individual
of
the
outer
fringe
she
caught
at
once
a
clear
understanding
of
his
social
point
of
view
his
art
ambition
his
dreams
of
something
better
for
himself
in
every
way
she
seemed
to
see
clearly
that
he
had
not
as
yet
realized
himself
that
aileen
was
not
just
the
woman
for
him
though
she
might
be
one
she
talked
of
her
own
husband
after
a
time
in
a
tolerant
way
his
foibles
defects
weaknesses
she
was
not
unsympathetic
he
thought
just
weary
of
a
state
that
was
not
properly
balanced
either
in
love
ability
or
insight
cowperwood
had
suggested
that
she
could
take
a
larger
studio
for
herself
and
harold
do
away
with
the
petty
economies
that
had
hampered
her
and
him
and
explain
it
all
on
the
grounds
of
a
larger
generosity
on
the
part
of
her
family
at
first
she
objected
but
cowperwood
was
tactful
and
finally
brought
it
about
he
again
suggested
a
little
while
later
that
she
should
persuade
harold
to
go
to
europe
there
would
be
the
same
ostensible
reason
additional
means
from
her
relatives
sohlberg
thus
urged
petted
made
over
assured
came
finally
to
accept
his
liberal
rule
to
bow
to
him
she
became
as
contented
as
a
cat
with
caution
she
accepted
of
his
largess
and
made
the
cleverest
use
of
it
she
could
for
something
over
a
year
neither
sohlberg
nor
aileen
was
aware
of
the
intimacy
which
had
sprung
up
sohlberg
easily
bamboozled
went
back
to
denmark
for
a
visit
then
to
study
in
germany
sohlberg
followed
cowperwood
to
europe
the
following
year
at
biarritz
paris
even
london
aileen
never
knew
that
there
was
an
additional
figure
in
the
background
cowperwood
was
trained
by
rita
into
a
really
finer
point
of
view
he
came
to
know
better
music
books
even
the
facts
she
encouraged
him
in
his
idea
of
a
representative
collection
of
the
old
masters
and
begged
him
to
be
cautious
in
his
selection
of
moderns
he
felt
himself
to
be
delightfully
situated
indeed
the
difficulty
with
this
situation
as
with
all
such
where
an
individual
ventures
thus
bucaneeringly
on
the
sea
of
sex
is
the
possibility
of
those
storms
which
result
from
misplaced
confidence
and
from
our
system
of
ethics
relating
to
property
in
women
to
cowperwood
however
who
was
a
law
unto
himself
who
knew
no
law
except
such
as
might
be
imposed
upon
him
by
his
lack
of
ability
to
think
this
possibility
of
entanglement
wrath
rage
pain
offered
no
particular
obstacle
it
was
not
at
all
certain
that
any
such
thing
would
follow
where
the
average
man
might
have
found
one
such
liaison
difficult
to
manage
cowperwood
as
we
have
seen
had
previously
entered
on
several
such
affairs
almost
simultaneously
and
now
he
had
ventured
on
yet
another
in
the
last
instance
with
much
greater
feeling
and
enthusiasm
the
previous
affairs
had
been
emotional
makeshifts
at
best
more
or
less
idle
philanderings
in
which
his
deeper
moods
and
feelings
were
not
concerned
in
the
case
of
sohlberg
all
this
was
changed
for
the
present
at
least
she
was
really
all
in
all
to
him
but
this
temperamental
characteristic
of
his
relating
to
his
love
of
women
his
artistic
if
not
emotional
subjection
to
their
beauty
and
the
mystery
of
their
personalities
led
him
into
still
a
further
affair
and
this
last
was
not
so
fortunate
in
its
outcome
antoinette
nowak
had
come
to
him
fresh
from
a
west
side
high
school
and
a
chicago
business
college
and
had
been
engaged
as
his
private
stenographer
and
secretary
this
girl
had
blossomed
forth
into
something
exceptional
as
american
children
of
foreign
parents
are
wont
to
do
you
would
have
scarcely
believed
that
she
with
her
fine
lithe
body
her
good
taste
in
dress
her
skill
in
stenography
bookkeeping
and
business
details
could
be
the
daughter
of
a
struggling
pole
who
had
first
worked
in
the
southwest
chicago
steel
mills
and
who
had
later
kept
a
cigar
news
and
stationery
store
in
the
polish
district
the
merchandise
of
and
a
back
room
for
idling
and
casual
gaming
being
the
principal
reasons
for
its
existence
antoinette
whose
first
name
had
not
been
antoinette
at
all
but
minka
the
antoinette
having
been
borrowed
by
her
from
an
article
in
one
of
the
chicago
sunday
papers
was
a
fine
dark
brooding
girl
ambitious
and
hopeful
who
ten
days
after
she
had
accepted
her
new
place
was
admiring
cowperwood
and
following
his
every
daring
movement
with
almost
excited
interest
to
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
she
thought
to
even
command
his
interest
let
alone
his
affection
must
be
wonderful
after
the
dull
world
she
had
known
it
seemed
dull
compared
to
the
upper
rarefied
realms
which
she
was
beginning
to
glimpse
through
him
and
after
the
average
men
in
the
office
over
the
way
where
she
had
first
worked
cowperwood
in
his
good
clothes
his
remote
mood
his
easy
commanding
manner
touched
the
most
ambitious
chords
of
her
being
one
day
she
saw
aileen
sweep
in
from
her
carriage
wearing
warm
brown
furs
smart
polished
boots
a
of
corded
brown
wool
and
a
fur
toque
sharpened
and
emphasized
by
a
long
feather
which
shot
upward
like
a
dagger
or
a
quill
pen
antoinette
hated
her
she
conceived
herself
to
be
better
or
as
good
at
least
why
was
life
divided
so
unfairly
what
sort
of
a
man
was
cowperwood
anyhow
one
night
after
she
had
written
out
a
discreet
but
truthful
history
of
himself
which
he
had
dictated
to
her
and
which
she
had
sent
to
the
chicago
newspapers
for
him
soon
after
the
opening
of
his
brokerage
office
in
chicago
she
went
home
and
dreamed
of
what
he
had
told
her
only
altered
of
course
as
in
dreams
she
thought
that
cowperwood
stood
beside
her
in
his
handsome
private
office
in
la
salle
street
and
asked
her
antoinette
what
do
you
think
of
me
antoinette
was
nonplussed
but
brave
in
her
dream
she
found
herself
intensely
interested
in
him
oh
i
do
know
what
to
think
i
so
sorry
was
her
answer
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
on
her
cheek
and
she
awoke
she
began
thinking
what
a
pity
what
a
shame
that
such
a
man
should
ever
have
been
in
prison
he
was
so
handsome
he
had
been
married
twice
perhaps
his
first
wife
was
very
homely
or
very
she
thought
of
this
and
the
next
day
went
to
work
meditatively
cowperwood
engrossed
in
his
own
plans
was
not
thinking
of
her
at
present
he
was
thinking
of
the
next
moves
in
his
interesting
gas
war
and
aileen
seeing
her
one
day
merely
considered
her
an
underling
the
woman
in
business
was
such
a
novelty
that
as
yet
she
was
declasse
aileen
really
thought
nothing
of
antoinette
at
all
somewhat
over
a
year
after
cowperwood
had
become
intimate
with
sohlberg
his
rather
practical
business
relations
with
antoinette
nowak
took
on
a
more
intimate
color
what
shall
we
say
of
this
that
he
had
already
wearied
of
sohlberg
not
in
the
least
he
was
desperately
fond
of
her
or
that
he
despised
aileen
whom
he
was
thus
grossly
deceiving
not
at
all
she
was
to
him
at
times
as
attractive
as
ever
perhaps
more
so
for
the
reason
that
her
rights
were
being
thus
roughly
infringed
upon
he
was
sorry
for
her
but
inclined
to
justify
himself
on
the
ground
that
these
other
relations
with
possibly
the
exception
of
sohlherg
were
not
enduring
if
it
had
been
possible
to
marry
sohlberg
he
might
have
done
so
and
he
did
speculate
at
times
as
to
whether
anything
would
ever
induce
aileen
to
leave
him
but
this
was
more
or
less
idle
speculation
he
rather
fancied
they
would
live
out
their
days
together
seeing
that
he
was
able
thus
easily
to
deceive
her
but
as
for
a
girl
like
antoinette
nowak
she
figured
in
that
braided
symphony
of
mere
sex
attraction
which
somehow
makes
up
that
geometric
formula
of
beauty
which
rules
the
world
she
was
charming
in
a
dark
way
beautiful
with
eyes
that
burned
with
an
unsatisfied
fire
and
cowperwood
although
at
first
only
in
the
least
moved
by
her
became
by
degrees
interested
in
her
wondering
at
the
amazing
transforming
power
of
the
american
atmosphere
are
your
parents
english
antoinette
he
asked
her
one
morning
with
that
easy
familiarity
which
he
assumed
to
all
underlings
and
minor
intellects
an
air
that
could
not
be
resented
in
him
and
which
was
usually
accepted
as
a
compliment
antoinette
clean
and
fresh
in
a
white
shirtwaist
a
black
a
ribbon
of
black
velvet
about
her
neck
and
her
long
black
hair
laid
in
a
heavy
braid
low
over
her
forehead
and
held
close
by
a
white
celluloid
comb
looked
at
him
with
pleased
and
grateful
eyes
she
had
been
used
to
such
different
types
of
men
the
earnest
fiery
excitable
sometimes
drunken
and
swearing
men
of
her
childhood
always
striking
marching
praying
in
the
catholic
churches
and
then
the
men
of
the
business
world
crazy
over
money
and
with
no
understanding
of
anything
save
some
few
facts
about
chicago
and
its
momentary
possibilities
in
cowperwood
office
taking
his
letters
and
hearing
him
talk
in
his
quick
genial
way
with
old
laughlin

and
others

had
learned
more
of
life
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
existed
he
was
like
a
vast
open
window
out
of
which
she
was
looking
upon
an
almost
illimitable
landscape
no
sir
she
replied
dropping
her
slim
firm
white
hand
holding
a
black
restfully
on
her
notebook
she
smiled
quite
innocently
because
she
was
pleased
i
thought
not
he
said
and
yet
you
american
enough
i
do
know
how
it
is
she
said
quite
solemnly
i
have
a
brother
who
is
quite
as
american
as
i
am
we
do
either
of
us
look
like
our
father
or
mother
what
does
your
brother
do
he
asked
indifferently
he
one
of
the
weighers
at
arneel
co
he
expects
to
be
a
manager
sometime
she
smiled
cowperwood
looked
at
her
speculatively
and
after
a
momentary
return
glance
she
dropped
her
eyes
slowly
in
spite
of
herself
a
telltale
flush
rose
and
mantled
her
brown
cheeks
it
always
did
when
he
looked
at
her
take
this
letter
to
general
van
sickle
he
began
on
this
occasion
quite
helpfully
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
recovered
she
could
not
be
near
cowperwood
for
long
at
a
time
however
without
being
stirred
by
a
feeling
which
was
not
of
her
own
willing
he
fascinated
and
suffused
her
with
a
dull
fire
she
sometimes
wondered
whether
a
man
so
remarkable
would
ever
be
interested
in
a
girl
like
her
the
end
of
this
essential
interest
of
course
was
the
eventual
assumption
of
antoinette
one
might
go
through
all
the
dissolving
details
of
days
in
which
she
sat
taking
dictation
receiving
instructions
going
about
her
office
duties
in
a
state
of
apparently
chill
practical
commercial
but
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
as
a
matter
of
fact
without
in
any
way
affecting
the
preciseness
and
accuracy
of
her
labor
her
thoughts
were
always
upon
the
man
in
the
inner
office
the
strange
master
who
was
then
seeing
his
men
and
in
between
so
it
seemed
a
whole
world
of
individuals
solemn
and
commercial
who
came
presented
their
cards
talked
at
times
almost
interminably
and
went
away
it
was
the
rare
individual
however
she
observed
who
had
the
long
conversation
with
cowperwood
and
that
interested
her
the
more
his
instructions
to
her
were
always
of
the
briefest
and
he
depended
on
her
native
intelligence
to
supply
much
that
he
scarcely
more
than
suggested
you
understand
do
you
was
his
customary
phrase
yes
she
would
reply
she
felt
as
though
she
were
fifty
times
as
significant
here
as
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
before
the
office
was
clean
hard
bright
like
cowperwood
himself
the
morning
sun
streaming
in
through
an
almost
solid
glass
east
front
shaded
by
roller
curtains
came
to
have
an
almost
romantic
atmosphere
for
her
cowperwood
private
office
as
in
philadelphia
was
a
solid
box
in
which
he
could
shut
himself
completely
when
the
door
was
closed
it
was
sacrosanct
he
made
it
a
rule
sensibly
to
keep
his
door
open
as
much
as
possible
even
when
he
was
dictating
sometimes
not
it
was
in
these
of
dictation
the
door
open
as
a
rule
for
he
did
not
care
for
too
much
privacy
that
he
and
miss
nowak
came
closest
after
months
and
months
and
because
he
had
been
busy
with
the
other
woman
mentioned
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
she
came
to
enter
sometimes
with
a
sense
of
suffocation
sometimes
of
maidenly
shame
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
her
to
admit
frankly
that
she
wanted
cowperwood
to
make
love
to
her
it
would
have
frightened
her
to
have
thought
of
herself
as
yielding
easily
and
yet
there
was
not
a
detail
of
his
personality
that
was
not
now
burned
in
her
brain
his
light
thick
always
smoothly
parted
hair
his
wide
clear
inscrutable
eyes
his
carefully
manicured
hands
so
full
and
firm
his
fresh
clothing
of
delicate
intricate
patterns
how
these
fascinated
her
he
seemed
always
remote
except
just
at
the
moment
of
doing
something
when
curiously
enough
he
seemed
intensely
intimate
and
near
one
day
after
many
exchanges
of
glances
in
which
her
own
always
fell
sharply
in
the
midst
of
a
letter
he
arose
and
closed
the
door
she
did
not
think
so
much
of
that
as
a
rule
it
had
happened
before
but
now
because
of
a
studied
glance
he
had
given
her
neither
tender
nor
smiling
she
felt
as
though
something
unusual
were
about
to
happen
her
own
body
was
going
hot
and
cold
by
turns
her
neck
and
hands
she
had
a
fine
figure
finer
than
she
realized
with
shapely
limbs
and
torso
her
head
had
some
of
the
sharpness
of
the
old
greek
coinage
and
her
hair
was
plaited
as
in
ancient
cut
stone
cowperwood
noted
it
he
came
back
and
without
taking
his
seat
bent
over
her
and
intimately
took
her
hand
antoinette
he
said
lifting
her
gently
she
looked
up
then
arose
for
he
slowly
drew
her
breathless
the
color
gone
much
of
the
capable
practicality
that
was
hers
completely
eliminated
she
felt
limp
inert
she
pulled
at
her
hand
faintly
and
then
lifting
her
eyes
was
fixed
by
that
hard
insatiable
gaze
of
his
her
head
swam
her
eyes
were
filled
with
a
telltale
confusion
antoinette
yes
she
murmured
you
love
me
do
you
she
tried
to
pull
herself
together
to
inject
some
of
her
native
rigidity
of
soul
into
her
air
that
rigidity
which
she
always
imagined
would
never
desert
her
but
it
was
gone
there
came
instead
to
her
a
picture
of
the
far
blue
island
avenue
neighborhood
from
which
she
emanated
its
low
brown
cottages
and
then
this
smart
hard
office
and
this
strong
man
he
came
out
of
such
a
marvelous
world
apparently
a
strange
foaming
seemed
to
be
in
her
blood
she
was
deliriously
deliciously
numb
and
happy
antoinette
oh
i
do
know
what
i
think
she
gasped
i
oh
yes
i
do
i
do
i
like
your
name
he
said
simply
antoinette
and
then
pulling
her
to
him
he
slipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
she
was
frightened
numb
and
then
suddenly
not
so
much
from
shame
as
shock
tears
rushed
to
her
eyes
she
turned
and
put
her
hand
on
the
desk
and
hung
her
head
and
sobbed
why
antoinette
he
asked
gently
bending
over
her
are
you
so
much
unused
to
the
world
i
thought
you
said
you
loved
me
do
you
want
me
to
forget
all
this
and
go
on
as
before
i
can
of
course
if
you
can
you
know
he
knew
that
she
loved
him
wanted
him
she
heard
him
plainly
enough
shaking
do
you
he
said
after
a
time
giving
her
moments
in
which
to
recover
oh
let
me
cry
she
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
say
quite
wildly
i
do
know
why
i
crying
it
just
because
i
nervous
i
suppose
please
do
mind
me
now
antoinette
he
repeated
look
at
me
will
you
stop
oh
no
not
now
my
eyes
are
so
bad
antoinette
come
look
he
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
see
not
so
terrible
oh
she
said
when
her
eyes
met
his
again
i
and
then
she
folded
her
arms
against
his
breast
while
he
petted
her
hand
and
held
her
close
i
not
so
bad
antoinette
it
you
as
much
as
it
is
me
you
do
love
me
then
yes
yes
oh
yes
and
you
do
mind
no
it
all
so
strange
her
face
was
hidden
kiss
me
then
she
put
up
her
lips
and
slipped
her
arms
about
him
he
held
her
close
he
tried
teasingly
to
make
her
say
why
she
cried
thinking
the
while
of
what
aileen
or
rita
would
think
if
they
knew
but
she
would
not
at
first
admitting
later
that
it
was
a
sense
of
evil
curiously
she
also
thought
of
aileen
and
how
on
occasion
she
had
seen
her
sweep
in
and
out
now
she
was
sharing
with
her
the
dashing
cowperwood
so
vain
and
superior
the
wonder
of
his
affection
strange
as
it
may
seem
she
looked
on
it
now
as
rather
an
honor
she
had
risen
in
her
own
estimation
her
sense
of
life
and
power
now
more
than
ever
before
she
knew
something
of
life
because
she
knew
something
of
love
and
passion
the
future
seemed
tremulous
with
promise
she
went
back
to
her
machine
after
a
while
thinking
of
this
what
would
it
all
come
to
she
wondered
wildly
you
could
not
have
told
by
her
eyes
that
she
had
been
crying
instead
a
rich
glow
in
her
brown
cheeks
heightened
her
beauty
no
disturbing
sense
of
aileen
was
involved
with
all
this
antoinette
was
of
the
newer
order
that
was
beginning
to
privately
question
ethics
and
morals
she
had
a
right
to
her
life
lead
where
it
would
and
to
what
it
would
bring
her
the
feel
of
cowperwood
lips
was
still
fresh
on
hers
what
would
the
future
reveal
to
her
now
what
chapter
xvii
an
overture
to
conflict
the
result
of
this
understanding
was
not
so
important
to
cowperwood
as
it
was
to
antoinette
in
a
vagrant
mood
he
had
unlocked
a
spirit
here
which
was
fiery
passionate
but
in
his
case
hopelessly
worshipful
however
much
she
might
be
grieved
by
him
antoinette
as
he
subsequently
learned
would
never
sin
against
his
personal
welfare
yet
she
was
unwittingly
the
means
of
first
opening
the
of
suspicion
on
aileen
thereby
establishing
in
the
latter
mind
the
fact
of
cowperwood
persistent
unfaithfulness
the
incidents
which
led
up
to
this
were
comparatively
trivial
nothing
more
indeed
at
first
than
the
sight
of
miss
nowak
and
cowperwood
talking
intimately
in
his
office
one
afternoon
when
the
others
had
gone
and
the
fact
that
she
appeared
to
be
a
little
bit
disturbed
by
arrival
later
came
the
discovery
though
of
this
aileen
could
not
be
absolutely
sure
of
cowperwood
and
antoinette
in
a
closed
carriage
one
stormy
november
afternoon
in
state
street
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
out
of
the
city
she
was
coming
out
of
merrill
store
at
the
time
and
just
happened
to
glance
at
the
passing
vehicle
which
was
running
near
the
curb
aileen
although
uncertain
was
greatly
shocked
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
not
left
town
she
journeyed
to
his
office
on
the
pretext
of
taking
old
laughlin
dog
jennie
a
pretty
collar
she
had
found
actually
to
find
if
antoinette
were
away
at
the
same
time
could
it
be
possible
she
kept
asking
herself
that
cowperwood
had
become
interested
in
his
own
stenographer
the
fact
that
the
office
assumed
that
he
was
out
of
town
and
that
antoinette
was
not
there
gave
her
pause
laughlin
quite
innocently
informed
her
that
he
thought
miss
nowak
had
gone
to
one
of
the
libraries
to
make
up
certain
reports
it
left
her
in
doubt
what
was
aileen
to
think
her
moods
and
aspirations
were
linked
so
closely
with
the
love
and
success
of
cowperwood
that
she
could
not
in
spite
of
herself
but
take
fire
at
the
least
thought
of
losing
him
he
himself
wondered
sometimes
as
he
threaded
the
paths
of
sex
what
she
would
do
once
she
discovered
his
variant
conduct
indeed
there
had
been
little
occasional
squabbles
not
sharp
but
suggestive
when
he
was
trifling
about
with
kittridge
ledwell
and
others
there
were
as
may
be
imagined
from
time
to
time
absences
brief
and
unimportant
which
he
explained
easily
passional
indifferences
which
were
not
explained
so
easily
and
the
like
but
since
his
affections
were
not
really
involved
in
any
of
those
instances
he
had
managed
to
smooth
the
matter
over
quite
nicely
why
do
you
say
that
he
would
demand
when
she
suggested
apropos
of
a
trip
or
a
day
when
she
had
not
been
with
him
that
there
might
have
been
another
you
know
there
has
if
i
am
going
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
you
learn
it
fast
enough
even
if
i
did
it
would
mean
that
i
was
unfaithful
to
you
spiritually
oh
would
it
exclaimed
aileen
resentfully
and
with
some
disturbance
of
spirit
well
you
can
keep
your
spiritual
faithfulness
i
not
going
to
be
content
with
any
sweet
thoughts
cowperwood
laughed
even
as
she
laughed
for
he
knew
she
was
right
and
he
felt
sorry
for
her
at
the
same
time
her
biting
humor
pleased
him
he
knew
that
she
did
not
really
suspect
him
of
actual
infidelity
he
was
obviously
so
fond
of
her
but
she
also
knew
that
he
was
innately
attractive
to
women
and
that
there
were
enough
of
the
philandering
type
to
want
to
lead
him
astray
and
make
her
life
a
burden
also
that
he
might
prove
a
very
willing
victim
sex
desire
and
its
fruition
being
such
an
integral
factor
in
the
marriage
and
every
other
sex
relation
the
average
woman
is
prone
to
study
the
periodic
manifestations
that
go
with
it
quite
as
one
dependent
on
the
weather
a
sailor
or
example
might
study
the
barometer
in
this
aileen
was
no
exception
she
was
so
beautiful
herself
and
had
been
so
much
to
cowperwood
physically
that
she
had
followed
the
corresponding
evidences
of
feeling
in
him
with
the
utmost
interest
accepting
the
recurring
ebullitions
of
his
physical
emotions
as
an
evidence
of
her
own
enduring
charm
as
time
went
on
however
and
that
was
long
before
sohlberg
or
any
one
else
had
appeared
the
original
flare
of
passion
had
undergone
a
form
of
subsidence
though
not
noticeable
enough
to
be
disturbing
aileen
thought
and
thought
but
she
did
not
investigate
indeed
because
of
the
precariousness
of
her
own
situation
as
a
social
failure
she
was
afraid
to
do
so
with
the
arrival
of
sohlberg
and
then
of
antoinette
nowak
as
factors
in
the
potpourri
the
situation
became
more
difficult
humanly
fond
of
aileen
as
cowperwood
was
and
because
of
his
lapses
and
her
affection
desirous
of
being
kind
yet
for
the
time
being
he
was
alienated
almost
completely
from
her
he
grew
remote
according
as
his
clandestine
affairs
were
drifting
or
blazing
without
however
losing
his
firm
grip
on
his
financial
affairs
and
aileen
noticed
it
it
worried
her
she
was
so
vain
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
cowperwood
could
long
be
indifferent
and
for
a
while
her
sentimental
interest
in
sohlberg
future
and
unhappiness
of
soul
beclouded
her
judgment
but
she
finally
began
to
feel
the
drift
of
affairs
the
pathos
of
all
this
is
that
it
so
quickly
descends
into
the
realm
of
the
unsatisfactory
the
banal
the
pseudo
intimate
aileen
noticed
it
at
once
she
tried
protestations
you
do
kiss
me
the
way
you
did
once
and
then
a
little
later
you
have
noticed
me
hardly
for
four
whole
days
what
the
matter
oh
i
do
know
replied
cowperwood
easily
i
guess
i
want
you
as
much
as
ever
i
do
see
that
i
am
any
different
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
petted
and
caressed
her
but
aileen
was
suspicious
nervous
the
psychology
of
the
human
animal
when
confronted
by
these
tangles
these
ripping
tides
of
the
heart
has
little
to
do
with
reason
or
logic
it
is
amazing
how
in
the
face
of
passion
and
the
affections
and
the
changing
face
of
life
all
plans
and
theories
by
which
we
guide
ourselves
fall
to
the
ground
here
was
aileen
talking
bravely
at
the
time
she
invaded
lillian
cowperwood
domain
of
the
necessity
of
her
frank
finding
a
woman
suitable
to
his
needs
tastes
abilities
but
now
that
the
possibility
of
another
woman
equally
or
possibly
better
suited
to
him
was
looming
in
the
offing
although
she
had
no
idea
who
it
might
be
she
could
not
reason
in
the
same
way
her
ox
god
wot
was
the
one
that
was
being
gored
what
if
he
should
find
some
one
whom
he
could
want
more
than
he
did
her
dear
heaven
how
terrible
that
would
be
what
would
she
do
she
asked
herself
thoughtfully
she
lapsed
into
the
blues
one
afternoon
almost
cried
she
could
scarcely
say
why
another
time
she
thought
of
all
the
terrible
things
she
would
do
how
difficult
she
would
make
it
for
any
other
woman
who
invaded
her
preserves
however
she
was
not
sure
would
she
declare
war
if
she
discovered
another
she
knew
she
would
eventually
and
yet
she
knew
too
that
if
she
did
and
cowperwood
were
set
in
his
passion
thoroughly
alienated
it
would
do
no
good
it
would
be
terrible
but
what
could
she
do
to
win
him
back
that
was
the
issue
once
warned
however
by
her
suspicious
questioning
cowperwood
was
more
mechanically
attentive
than
ever
he
did
his
best
to
conceal
his
altered
mood
his
enthusiasms
for
sohlberg
his
interest
in
antoinette
nowak
and
this
helped
somewhat
but
finally
there
was
a
detectable
change
aileen
noticed
it
first
after
they
had
been
back
from
europe
nearly
a
year
at
this
time
she
was
still
interested
in
sohlberg
but
in
a
harmlessly
flirtatious
way
she
thought
he
might
be
interesting
physically
but
would
he
be
as
delightful
as
cowperwood
never
when
she
felt
that
cowperwood
himself
might
be
changing
she
pulled
herself
up
at
once
and
when
antoinette
appeared
the
carriage
incident
sohlberg
lost
his
at
best
unstable
charm
she
began
to
meditate
on
what
a
terrible
thing
it
would
be
to
lose
cowperwood
seeing
that
she
had
failed
to
establish
herself
socially
perhaps
that
had
something
to
do
with
his
defection
no
doubt
it
had
yet
she
could
not
believe
after
all
his
protestations
of
affection
in
philadelphia
after
all
her
devotion
to
him
in
those
dark
days
of
his
degradation
and
punishment
that
he
would
really
turn
on
her
no
he
might
stray
momentarily
but
if
she
protested
enough
made
a
scene
perhaps
he
would
not
feel
so
free
to
injure
her
he
would
remember
and
be
loving
and
devoted
again
after
seeing
him
or
imagining
she
had
seen
him
in
the
carriage
she
thought
at
first
that
she
would
question
him
but
later
decided
that
she
would
wait
and
watch
more
closely
perhaps
he
was
beginning
to
run
around
with
other
women
there
was
safety
in
numbers
that
she
knew
her
heart
her
pride
was
hurt
but
not
broken
chapter

the
clash
the
peculiar
personality
of
rita
sohlberg
was
such
that
by
her
very
action
she
ordinarily
allayed
suspicion
or
rather
distracted
it
although
a
novice
she
had
a
strange
ease
courage
or
balance
of
soul
which
kept
her
whole
and
under
the
most
trying
of
circumstances
she
might
have
been
overtaken
in
the
most
compromising
of
positions
but
her
manner
would
always
have
indicated
ease
a
sense
of
innocence
nothing
unusual
for
she
had
no
sense
of
moral
degradation
in
this
matter
no
troublesome
emotion
as
to
what
was
to
flow
from
a
relationship
of
this
kind
no
worry
as
to
her
own
soul
sin
social
opinion
or
the
like
she
was
really
interested
in
art
and
life
a
pagan
in
fact
some
people
are
thus
hardily
equipped
it
is
the
most
notable
attribute
of
the
hardier
type
of
personalities
not
necessarily
the
most
brilliant
or
successful
you
might
have
said
that
her
soul
was
naively
unconscious
of
the
agony
of
others
in
loss
she
would
have
taken
any
loss
to
herself
with
an
amazing
equableness
some
qualms
of
course
but
not
many
because
her
vanity
and
sense
of
charm
would
have
made
her
look
forward
to
something
better
or
as
good
she
had
called
on
aileen
quite
regularly
in
the
past
with
or
without
harold
and
had
frequently
driven
with
the
cowperwoods
or
joined
them
at
the
theater
or
elsewhere
she
had
decided
after
becoming
intimate
with
cowperwood
to
study
art
again
which
was
a
charming
blind
for
it
called
for
attendance
at
afternoon
or
evening
classes
which
she
frequently
skipped
besides
since
harold
had
more
money
he
was
becoming
gayer
more
reckless
and
enthusiastic
over
women
and
cowperwood
deliberately
advised
her
to
encourage
him
in
some
liaison
which
in
case
exposure
should
subsequently
come
to
them
would
effectually
tie
his
hands
let
him
get
in
some
affair
cowperwood
told
rita
we
put
detectives
on
his
trail
and
get
evidence
he
wo
have
a
word
to
say
we
do
really
need
to
do
that
she
protested
sweetly
naively
he
been
in
enough
scrapes
as
it
is
he
given
me
some
of
the
letters
she
pronounced
it
lettahs
written
him
but
we
need
actual
witnesses
if
we
ever
need
anything
at
all
just
tell
me
when
he
in
love
again
and
i
do
the
rest
you
know
i
think
she
drawled
amusingly
that
he
is
now
i
saw
him
on
the
street
the
other
day
with
one
of
his
students
rather
a
pretty
girl
too
cowperwood
was
pleased
under
the
circumstances
he
would
almost
have
been
willing
not
quite
for
aileen
to
succumb
to
sohlberg
in
order
to
entrap
her
and
make
his
situation
secure
yet
he
really
did
not
wish
it
in
the
last
analysis
would
have
been
grieved
temporarily
if
she
had
deserted
him
however
in
the
case
of
sohlberg
detectives
were
employed
the
new
affair
with
the
flighty
pupil
was
unearthed
and
sworn
to
by
witnesses
and
this
combined
with
the
lettahs
held
by
rita
constituted
ample
material
wherewith
to
hush
up
the
musician
if
ever
he
became
unduly
obstreperous
so
cowperwood
and
rita
state
was
quite
comfortable
but
aileen
meditating
over
antoinette
nowak
was
beside
herself
with
curiosity
doubt
worry
she
did
not
want
to
injure
cowperwood
in
any
way
after
his
bitter
philadelphia
experience
and
yet
when
she
thought
of
his
deserting
her
in
this
way
she
fell
into
a
great
rage
her
vanity
as
much
as
her
love
was
hurt
what
could
she
do
to
justify
or
set
at
rest
her
suspicions
watch
him
personally
she
was
too
dignified
and
vain
to
lurk
about
or
offices
or
hotels
never
start
a
quarrel
without
additional
evidence
that
would
be
silly
he
was
too
shrewd
to
give
her
further
evidence
once
she
spoke
he
would
merely
deny
it
she
brooded
irritably
recalling
after
a
time
and
with
an
aching
heart
that
her
father
had
put
detectives
on
her
track
once
ten
years
before
and
had
actually
discovered
her
relations
with
cowperwood
and
their
rendezvous
bitter
as
that
memory
was
torturing
yet
now
the
same
means
seemed
not
too
abhorrent
to
employ
under
the
circumstances
no
harm
had
come
to
cowperwood
in
the
former
instance
she
reasoned
to
herself
no
especial
harm
from
that
discovery
this
was
not
true
and
none
would
come
to
him
now
this
also
was
not
true
but
one
must
forgive
a
fiery
passionate
soul
wounded
to
the
quick
some
errors
of
judgment
her
thought
was
that
she
would
first
be
sure
just
what
it
was
her
beloved
was
doing
and
then
decide
what
course
to
take
but
she
knew
that
she
was
treading
on
dangerous
ground
and
mentally
she
recoiled
from
the
consequences
which
might
follow
he
might
leave
her
if
she
fought
him
too
bitterly
he
might
treat
her
as
he
had
treated
his
first
wife
lillian
she
studied
her
liege
lord
curiously
these
days
wondering
if
it
were
true
that
he
had
deserted
her
already
as
he
had
deserted
his
first
wife
thirteen
years
before
wondering
if
he
could
really
take
up
with
a
girl
as
common
as
antoinette
nowak
wondering
wondering
wondering
half
afraid
and
yet
courageous
what
could
be
done
with
him
if
only
he
still
loved
her
all
would
be
well
yet
but
oh
the
detective
agency
to
which
she
finally
applied
after
weeks
of
suspense
was
one
of
those
disturbingly
human
implements
which
many
are
not
opposed
to
using
on
occasion
when
it
is
the
only
means
of
solving
a
troublous
problem
of
wounded
feelings
or
jeopardized
interests
aileen
being
obviously
rich
was
forthwith
shamefully
overcharged
but
the
services
agreed
upon
were
well
performed
to
her
amazement
chagrin
and
distress
after
a
few
weeks
of
observation
cowperwood
was
reported
to
have
affairs
not
only
with
antoinette
nowak
whom
she
did
suspect
but
also
with
sohlberg
and
these
two
affairs
at
one
and
the
same
time
for
the
moment
it
left
aileen
actually
stunned
and
breathless
the
significance
of
rita
sohlberg
to
her
in
this
hour
was
greater
than
that
of
any
woman
before
or
after
of
all
living
things
women
dread
women
most
of
all
and
of
all
women
the
clever
and
beautiful
rita
sohlberg
had
been
growing
on
aileen
as
a
personage
for
she
had
obviously
been
prospering
during
this
past
year
and
her
beauty
had
been
amazingly
enhanced
thereby
once
aileen
had
encountered
rita
in
a
light
trap
on
the
avenue
very
handsome
and
very
new
and
she
had
commented
on
it
to
cowperwood
whose
reply
had
been
her
father
must
be
making
some
money
sohlberg
could
never
earn
it
for
her
aileen
sympathized
with
harold
because
of
his
temperament
but
she
knew
that
what
cowperwood
said
was
true
another
time
at
a
at
the
theater
she
had
noted
the
rich
elaborateness
of
sohlberg
dainty
frock
the
endless
pleatings
of
pale
silk
the
startling
charm
of
the
needlework
and
the
ribbons
countless
rosetted
small
that
meant
hard
work
on
the
part
of
some
one
how
lovely
this
is
she
had
commented
yes
rita
had
replied
airily
i
thought
do
you
know
my
dressmaker
would
never
get
done
working
on
it
it
had
cost
all
told
two
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
and
cowperwood
had
gladly
paid
the
bill
aileen
went
home
at
the
time
thinking
of
rita
taste
and
of
how
well
she
had
harmonized
her
materials
to
her
personality
she
was
truly
charming
now
however
when
it
appeared
that
the
same
charm
that
had
appealed
to
her
had
appealed
to
cowperwood
she
conceived
an
angry
animal
opposition
to
it
all
rita
sohlberg
ha
a
lot
of
satisfaction
get
knowing
as
she
would
soon
that
cowperwood
was
sharing
his
affection
for
her
with
antoinette
nowak
a
mere
stenographer
and
a
lot
of
satisfaction
antoinette
would
get
the
cheap
upstart
when
she
learned
as
she
would
that
cowperwood
loved
her
so
lightly
that
he
would
take
an
apartment
for
rita
sohlberg
and
let
a
cheap
hotel
or
an
do
for
her
but
in
spite
of
this
savage
exultation
her
thoughts
kept
coming
back
to
herself
to
her
own
predicament
to
torture
and
destroy
her
cowperwood
the
liar
cowperwood
the
pretender
cowperwood
the
sneak
at
one
moment
she
conceived
a
kind
of
horror
of
the
man
because
of
all
his
protestations
to
her
at
the
next
a
rage
bitter
swelling
at
the
next
a
pathetic
realization
of
her
own
altered
position
say
what
one
will
to
take
the
love
of
a
man
like
cowperwood
away
from
a
woman
like
aileen
was
to
leave
her
high
and
dry
on
land
as
a
fish
out
of
its
native
element
to
take
all
the
wind
out
of
her
sails
almost
to
kill
her
whatever
position
she
had
once
thought
to
hold
through
him
was
now
jeopardized
whatever
joy
or
glory
she
had
had
in
being
frank
algernon
cowperwood
it
was
now
tarnished
she
sat
in
her
room
this
same
day
after
the
detectives
had
given
their
report
a
tired
look
in
her
eyes
the
first
set
lines
her
pretty
mouth
had
ever
known
showing
about
it
her
past
and
her
future
whirling
painfully
and
nebulously
in
her
brain
suddenly
she
got
up
and
seeing
cowperwood
picture
on
her
dresser
his
still
impressive
eyes
contemplating
her
she
seized
it
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
stamping
on
his
handsome
face
with
her
pretty
foot
and
raging
at
him
in
her
heart
the
dog
the
brute
her
brain
was
full
of
the
thought
of
rita
white
arms
about
him
of
his
lips
to
hers
the
spectacle
of
rita
fluffy
gowns
her
enticing
costumes
was
in
her
eyes
rita
should
not
have
him
she
should
not
have
anything
connected
with
him
nor
for
that
matter
antoinette
nowak
either
the
wretched
upstart
the
hireling
to
think
he
should
stoop
to
an
office
stenographer
once
on
that
thought
she
decided
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
woman
as
an
assistant
any
more
he
owed
it
to
her
to
love
her
after
all
she
had
done
for
him
the
coward
and
to
let
other
women
alone
her
brain
whirled
with
strange
thoughts
she
was
really
not
sane
in
her
present
state
she
was
so
wrought
up
by
her
prospective
loss
that
she
could
only
think
of
rash
impossible
destructive
things
to
do
she
dressed
swiftly
feverishly
and
calling
a
closed
carriage
from
the
ordered
herself
to
be
driven
to
the
new
arts
building
she
would
show
this
rosy
cat
of
a
woman
this
smiling
piece
of
impertinence
this
whether
she
would
lure
cowperwood
away
she
meditated
as
she
rode
she
would
not
sit
back
and
be
robbed
as
cowperwood
had
been
by
her
never
he
could
not
treat
her
that
way
she
would
die
first
she
would
kill
rita
sohlberg
and
antoinette
nowak
and
cowperwood
and
herself
first
she
would
prefer
to
die
that
way
rather
than
lose
his
love
oh
yes
a
thousand
times
fortunately
rita
sohlberg
was
not
at
the
new
arts
building
or
sohlberg
either
they
had
gone
to
a
reception
nor
was
she
at
the
apartment
on
the
north
side
where
under
the
name
of
jacobs
as
aileen
had
been
informed
by
the
detectives
she
and
cowperwood
kept
occasional
tryst
aileen
hesitated
for
a
moment
feeling
it
useless
to
wait
then
she
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
to
her
husband
office
it
was
now
nearly
five
antoinette
and
cowperwood
had
both
gone
but
she
did
not
know
it
she
changed
her
mind
however
before
she
reached
the
office
for
it
was
rita
sohlberg
she
wished
to
reach
first
and
ordered
her
coachman
to
drive
back
to
the
sohlberg
studio
but
still
they
had
not
returned
in
a
kind
of
aimless
rage
she
went
home
wondering
how
she
should
reach
rita
sohlberg
first
and
alone
then
to
her
savage
delight
the
game
walked
into
her
bag
the
sohlbergs
returning
home
at
six
from
some
reception
farther
out
michigan
avenue
had
stopped
at
the
wish
of
harold
merely
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
cowperwood
rita
was
exquisite
in
a
and
lavender
concoction
with
silver
braid
worked
in
here
and
there
her
gloves
and
shoes
were
pungent
bits
of
romance
her
hat
a
dream
of
graceful
lines
at
the
sight
of
her
aileen
who
was
still
in
the
hall
and
had
opened
the
door
herself
fairly
burned
to
seize
her
by
the
throat
and
strike
her
but
she
restrained
herself
sufficiently
to
say
come
in
she
still
had
sense
enough
and
enough
to
conceal
her
wrath
and
to
close
the
door
beside
his
wife
harold
was
standing
offensively
smug
and
inefficient
in
the
fashionable
and
silk
hat
of
the
time
a
restraining
influence
as
yet
he
was
bowing
and
smiling
oh
this
sound
was
neither
an
oh
nor
an
ah
but
a
kind
of
danish
inflected
awe
which
was
usually
not
unpleasing
to
hear
how
are
you
once
more
meeses
cowperwood
it
eez
sudge
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
awe
wo
you
two
just
go
in
the
a
moment
said
aileen
almost
hoarsely
i
be
right
in
i
want
to
get
something
then
as
an
afterthought
she
called
very
sweetly
oh
sohlberg
you
come
up
to
my
room
for
a
moment
i
have
something
i
want
to
show
you
rita
responded
promptly
she
always
felt
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
be
very
nice
to
aileen
we
have
only
a
moment
to
stay
she
replied
archly
and
sweetly
and
coming
out
in
the
hall
but
i
come
up
aileen
stayed
to
see
her
go
first
then
followed
swiftly
surely
entered
after
rita
and
closed
the
door
with
a
courage
and
rage
born
of
a
purely
animal
despair
she
turned
and
locked
it
then
she
wheeled
swiftly
her
eyes
lit
with
a
savage
fire
her
cheeks
pale
but
later
aflame
her
hands
her
fingers
working
in
a
strange
unconscious
way
so
she
said
looking
at
rita
and
coming
toward
her
quickly
and
angrily
you
steal
my
husband
will
you
you
live
in
a
secret
apartment
will
you
you
come
here
smiling
and
lying
to
me
will
you
you
beast
you
cat
you
prostitute
i
show
you
now
you
beast
i
know
you
now
for
what
you
are
i
teach
you
once
for
all
take
that
and
that
and
that
suiting
action
to
word
aileen
had
descended
upon
her
whirlwind
animal
fashion
striking
scratching
choking
tearing
her
visitor
hat
from
her
head
ripping
the
laces
from
her
neck
beating
her
in
the
face
and
clutching
violently
at
her
hair
and
throat
to
choke
and
mar
her
beauty
if
she
could
for
the
moment
she
was
really
crazy
with
rage
by
the
suddenness
of
this
onslaught
rita
sohlberg
was
taken
back
completely
it
all
came
so
swiftly
so
terribly
she
scarcely
realized
what
was
happening
before
the
storm
was
upon
her
there
was
no
time
for
arguments
pleas
anything
terrified
shamed
nonplussed
she
went
down
quite
limply
under
this
almost
lightning
attack
when
aileen
began
to
strike
her
she
attempted
in
vain
to
defend
herself
uttering
at
the
same
time
piercing
screams
which
could
be
heard
throughout
the
house
she
screamed
shrilly
strangely
like
a
wild
dying
animal
on
the
instant
all
her
fine
civilized
poise
had
deserted
her
from
the
sweetness
and
delicacy
of
the
reception
atmosphere
the
polite
cooings
posturings
and
mouthings
so
charming
to
contemplate
so
alluring
in
her
she
had
dropped
on
the
instant
to
that
native
animal
condition
that
shows
itself
in
fear
her
eyes
had
a
look
of
hunted
horror
her
lips
and
cheeks
were
pale
and
drawn
she
retreated
in
a
staggering
ungraceful
way
she
writhed
and
squirmed
screaming
in
the
strong
clutch
of
the
irate
and
vigorous
aileen
cowperwood
entered
the
hall
below
just
before
the
screams
began
he
had
followed
the
sohlbergs
almost
immediately
from
his
office
and
chancing
to
glance
in
the
he
had
observed
sohlberg
smiling
radiant
an
intangible
air
of
social
and
artistic
sycophancy
about
him
his
long
black
buttoned
smoothly
around
his
body
his
silk
hat
still
in
his
hands
awe
how
do
you
do
meezter
cowperwood
he
was
beginning
to
say
his
curly
head
shaking
in
a
friendly
manner
i
soa
glad
to
see
you
again
when
but
who
can
imitate
a
scream
of
terror
we
have
no
words
no
symbols
even
for
those
essential
sounds
of
fright
and
agony
they
filled
the
hall
the
library
the
the
distant
kitchen
even
and
basement
with
a
kind
of
vibrant
terror
cowperwood
always
the
man
of
action
as
opposed
to
nervous
cogitation
braced
up
on
the
instant
like
taut
wire
what
for
heaven
sake
could
that
be
what
a
terrible
cry
sohlberg
the
artist
responding
like
a
chameleon
to
the
various
emotional
complexions
of
life
began
to
breathe
stertorously
to
blanch
to
lose
control
of
himself
my
god
he
exclaimed
throwing
up
his
hands
that
rita
in
your
wife
room
something
must
have
happened
oh
on
the
instant
he
was
quite
beside
himself
terrified
shaking
almost
useless
cowperwood
on
the
contrary
without
a
moment
hesitation
had
thrown
his
coat
to
the
floor
dashed
up
the
stairs
followed
by
sohlberg
what
could
it
be
where
was
aileen
as
he
bounded
upward
a
clear
sense
of
something
untoward
came
over
him
it
was
sickening
terrifying
scream
scream
scream
came
the
sounds
oh
my
god
do
kill
me
help
help
scream
this
last
a
long
terrified
wail
sohlberg
was
about
to
drop
from
heart
failure
he
was
so
frightened
his
face
was
an
ashen
gray
cowperwood
seized
the
vigorously
and
finding
the
door
locked
shook
rattled
and
banged
at
it
aileen
he
called
sharply
aileen
what
the
matter
in
there
open
this
door
aileen
oh
my
god
oh
help
help
oh
mercy
it
was
the
moaning
voice
of
rita
i
show
you
you
he
heard
aileen
calling
i
teach
you
you
beast
you
cat
you
prostitute
there
there
there
aileen
he
called
hoarsely
aileen
then
getting
no
response
and
the
screams
continuing
he
turned
angrily
stand
back
he
exclaimed
to
sohlberg
who
was
moaning
helplessly
get
me
a
chair
get
me
a
table
anything
the
butler
ran
to
obey
but
before
he
could
return
cowperwood
had
found
an
implement
here
he
said
seizing
a
long
thin
heavily
carved
and
heavily
wrought
oak
chair
which
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
on
the
landing
he
whirled
it
vigorously
over
his
head
smash
the
sound
rose
louder
than
the
screams
inside
smash
the
chair
creaked
and
almost
broke
but
the
door
did
not
give
smash
the
chair
broke
and
the
door
flew
open
he
had
knocked
the
lock
loose
and
had
leaped
in
to
where
aileen
kneeling
over
rita
on
the
floor
was
choking
and
beating
her
into
insensibility
like
an
animal
he
was
upon
her
aileen
he
shouted
fiercely
in
a
hoarse
ugly
guttural
voice
you
fool
you
idiot
let
go
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
what
are
you
trying
to
do
have
you
lost
your
mind
you
crazy
idiot
he
seized
her
strong
hands
and
ripped
them
apart
he
fairly
dragged
her
back
half
twisting
and
half
throwing
her
over
his
knee
loosing
her
clutching
hold
she
was
so
insanely
furious
that
she
still
struggled
and
cried
saying
let
me
at
her
let
me
at
her
i
teach
her
do
you
try
to
hold
me
you
dog

cowperwood
firmly
to
sohlberg
and

unconscious
from
sheer
terror

began
striking
at
him
i
teach
you
how
to
run
around
with
other
women
you
dog
you
brute
cowperwood
merely
gripped
her
hands
and
shook
her
vigorously
forcefully
what
the
devil
has
got
into
you
anyway
you
fool
he
said
to
her
bitterly
as
they
carried
rita
out
what
are
you
trying
to
do
anyway
murder
her
do
you
want
the
police
to
come
in

i
shove
a
handkerchief
in
your
mouth
stop
i
tell
you
stop
do
you
hear
me
this
is
enough
you
fool
he
clapped
his
hand
over
her
mouth
pressing
it
tight
and
forcing
her
back
against
him
he
shook
her
brutally
angrily
he
was
very
strong
now
will
you
stop
he
insisted
or
do
you
want
me
to
choke
you
quiet
i
will
if
you
do
you
out
of
your
mind
stop
i
tell
you
so
this
is
the
way
you
carry
on
when
things
do
go
to
suit
you
she
was
sobbing
struggling
moaning
half
screaming
quite
beside
herself
oh
you
crazy
fool
he
said
swinging
her
round
and
with
an
effort
getting
out
a
handkerchief
which
he
forced
over
her
face
and
in
her
mouth
there
he
said
relievedly
now
will
you
shut
up
holding
her
tight
in
an
iron
grip
he
let
her
struggle
and
turn
quite
ready
to
put
an
end
to
her
breathing
if
necessary
now
that
he
had
conquered
her
he
continued
to
hold
her
tightly
stooping
beside
her
on
one
knee
listening
and
meditating
hers
was
surely
a
terrible
passion
from
some
points
of
view
he
could
not
blame
her
great
was
her
provocation
great
her
love
he
knew
her
disposition
well
enough
to
have
anticipated
something
of
this
sort
yet
the
wretchedness
shame
scandal
of
the
terrible
affair
upset
his
customary
equilibrium
to
think
any
one
should
give
way
to
such
a
storm
as
this
to
think
that
aileen
should
do
it
to
think
that
rita
should
have
been
so
mistreated
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
she
was
seriously
injured
marred
for
life
possibly
even
killed
the
horror
of
that
the
ensuing
storm
of
public
rage
a
trial
his
whole
career
gone
up
in
one
terrific
explosion
of
woe
anger
death
great
god
he
called
the
butler
to
him
by
a
nod
of
his
head
when
the
latter
who
had
gone
out
with
rita
hurried
back
how
is
she
he
asked
desperately
seriously
hurt
no
sir
i
think
not
i
believe
she
just
fainted
she
be
all
right
in
a
little
while
sir
can
i
be
of
any
service
sir
ordinarily
cowperwood
would
have
smiled
at
such
a
scene
now
he
was
cold
sober
not
now
he
replied
with
a
sigh
of
relief
still
holding
aileen
firmly
go
out
and
close
the
door
call
a
doctor
wait
in
the
hall
when
he
comes
call
me
aileen
conscious
of
things
being
done
for
rita
of
sympathy
being
extended
to
her
tried
to
get
up
to
scream
again
but
she
could
her
lord
and
master
held
her
in
an
ugly
hold
when
the
door
was
closed
he
said
again
now
aileen
will
you
hush
will
you
let
me
get
up
and
talk
to
you
or
must
we
stay
here
all
night
do
you
want
me
to
drop
you
forever
after
i
understand
all
about
this
but
i
am
in
control
now
and
i
am
going
to
stay
so
you
will
come
to
your
senses
and
be
reasonable
or
i
will
leave
you
as
sure
as
i
am
here
his
voice
rang
convincingly
now
shall
we
talk
sensibly
or
will
you
go
on
making
a
fool
of
yourself
disgracing
me
disgracing
the
house
making
yourself
and
myself
the
of
the
servants
the
neighborhood
the
city
this
is
a
fine
showing
you
made
good
god
a
fine
showing
indeed
a
brawl
in
this
house
a
fight
i
thought
you
had
better
sense
more
really
i
did
you
have
seriously
jeopardized
my
chances
here
in
chicago
you
have
seriously
injured
and
possibly
killed
a
woman
you
could
even
be
hanged
for
that
do
you
hear
me
oh
let
them
hang
me
groaned
aileen
i
want
to
die
he
took
away
his
hand
from
her
mouth
loosened
his
grip
upon
her
arms
and
let
her
get
to
her
feet
she
was
still
torrential
impetuous
ready
to
upbraid
him
but
once
standing
she
was
confronted
by
him
cold
commanding
fixing
her
with
a
fishy
eye
he
wore
a
look
now
she
had
never
seen
on
his
face
before
a
hard
wintry
dynamic
flare
which
no
one
but
his
commercial
enemies
and
only
those
occasionally
had
seen
now
stop
he
exclaimed
not
one
more
word
not
one
do
you
hear
me
she
wavered
quailed
gave
way
all
the
fury
of
her
tempestuous
soul
fell
as
the
sea
falls
under
a
lapse
of
wind
she
had
had
it
in
heart
on
her
lips
to
cry
again
you
dog
you
brute
and
a
hundred
other
terrible
useless
things
but
somehow
under
the
pressure
of
his
gaze
the
hardness
of
his
heart
the
words
on
her
lips
died
away
she
looked
at
him
uncertainly
for
a
moment
then
turning
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
near
by
clutched
her
cheeks
and
mouth
and
eyes
and
rocking
back
and
forth
in
an
agony
of
woe
she
began
to
sob
oh
my
god
my
god
my
heart
my
life
i
want
to
die
i
want
to
die
standing
there
watching
her
there
suddenly
came
to
cowperwood
a
keen
sense
of
her
soul
hurt
her
heart
hurt
and
he
was
moved
aileen
he
said
after
a
moment
or
two
coming
over
and
touching
her
quite
gently
aileen
do
cry
so
i
have
left
you
yet
your
life
is
utterly
ruined
do
cry
this
is
bad
business
but
perhaps
it
is
not
without
remedy
come
now
pull
yourself
together
aileen
for
answer
she
merely
rocked
and
moaned
uncontrolled
and
uncontrollable
being
anxious
about
conditions
elsewhere
he
turned
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
he
must
make
some
show
for
the
benefit
of
the
doctor
and
the
servants
he
must
look
after
rita
and
offer
some
sort
of
passing
explanation
to
sohlherg
here
he
called
to
a
passing
servant
shut
that
door
and
watch
it
if
cowperwood
comes
out
call
me
instantly
chapter
xix
hell
hath
no
fury
rita
was
not
dead
by
any
means
only
seriously
bruised
scratched
and
choked
her
scalp
was
cut
in
one
place
aileen
had
repeatedly
beaten
her
head
on
the
floor
and
this
might
have
resulted
seriously
if
cowperwood
had
not
entered
as
quickly
as
he
had
sohlberg
for
the
moment
for
some
little
time
in
fact
was
under
the
impression
that
aileen
had
truly
lost
her
mind
had
suddenly
gone
crazy
and
that
those
shameless
charges
he
had
heard
her
making
were
the
emanations
of
a
disordered
brain
nevertheless
the
things
she
had
said
haunted
him
he
was
in
a
bad
state
himself
almost
a
subject
for
the
doctor
his
lips
were
bluish
his
cheeks
blanched
rita
had
been
carried
into
an
adjoining
bedroom
and
laid
upon
a
bed
cold
water
ointments
a
bottle
of
arnica
had
been
procured
and
when
cowperwood
appeared
she
was
conscious
and
somewhat
better
but
she
was
still
very
weak
and
smarting
from
her
wounds
both
mental
and
physical
when
the
doctor
arrived
he
had
been
told
that
a
lady
a
guest
had
fallen
when
cowperwood
came
in
the
physician
was
dressing
her
wounds
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
cowperwood
said
to
the
maid
in
attendance
go
get
me
some
hot
water
as
the
latter
disappeared
he
bent
over
and
kissed
rita
bruised
lips
putting
his
finger
to
his
own
in
warning
sign
rita
he
asked
softly
are
you
fully
conscious
she
nodded
weakly
listen
then
he
said
bending
over
and
speaking
slowly
listen
carefully
pay
strict
attention
to
what
i
saying
you
must
understand
every
word
and
do
as
i
tell
you
you
are
not
seriously
injured
you
will
be
all
right
this
will
blow
over
i
have
sent
for
another
doctor
to
call
on
you
at
your
studio
your
husband
has
gone
for
some
fresh
clothes
he
will
come
back
in
a
little
while
my
carriage
will
take
you
home
when
you
are
a
little
stronger
you
must
worry
everything
will
be
all
right
but
you
must
deny
everything
do
you
hear
everything
in
so
far
as
you
know
cowperwood
is
insane
i
will
talk
to
your
husband
i
will
send
you
a
trained
nurse
meantime
you
must
be
careful
of
what
you
say
and
how
you
say
it
be
perfectly
calm
do
worry
you
are
perfectly
safe
here
and
you
will
be
there
cowperwood
will
not
trouble
you
any
more
i
will
see
to
that
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
love
you
i
am
near
you
all
the
while
you
must
not
let
this
make
any
difference
you
will
not
see
her
any
more
still
he
knew
that
it
would
make
a
difference
reassured
as
to
rita
condition
he
went
back
to
aileen
room
to
plead
with
her
again
to
soothe
her
if
he
could
he
found
her
up
and
dressing
a
new
thought
and
determination
in
her
mind
since
she
had
thrown
herself
on
the
bed
sobbing
and
groaning
her
mood
had
gradually
changed
she
began
to
reason
that
if
she
could
not
dominate
him
could
not
make
him
properly
sorry
she
had
better
leave
it
was
evident
she
thought
that
he
did
not
love
her
any
more
seeing
that
his
anxiety
to
protect
rita
had
been
so
great
his
brutality
in
restraining
her
so
marked
and
yet
she
did
not
want
to
believe
that
this
was
so
he
had
been
so
wonderful
to
her
in
times
past
she
had
not
given
up
all
hope
of
winning
a
victory
over
him
and
these
other
women
she
loved
him
too
much
but
only
a
separation
would
do
it
that
might
bring
him
to
his
senses
she
would
get
up
dress
and
go
to
a
hotel
he
should
not
see
her
any
more
unless
he
followed
her
she
was
satisfied
that
she
had
broken
up
the
liaison
with
rita
sohlberg
anyway
for
the
present
and
as
for
antoinette
nowak
she
would
attend
to
her
later
her
brain
and
her
heart
ached
she
was
so
full
of
woe
and
rage
alternating
that
she
could
not
cry
any
more
now
she
stood
before
her
mirror
trying
with
trembling
fingers
to
do
over
her
toilet
and
adjust
a
cowperwood
was
disturbed
nonplussed
at
this
unexpected
sight
aileen
he
said
finally
coming
up
behind
her
ca
you
and
i
talk
this
thing
over
peacefully
now
you
do
want
to
do
anything
that
you
be
sorry
for
i
do
want
you
to
i
sorry
you
really
believe
that
i
ceased
to
love
you
do
you
i
have
you
know
this
thing
is
as
bad
as
it
looks
i
should
think
you
would
have
a
little
more
sympathy
with
me
after
all
we
have
been
through
together
you
have
any
real
evidence
of
on
which
to
base
any
such
outburst
as
this
oh
have
i
she
exclaimed
turning
from
the
mirror
where
sorrowfully
and
bitterly
she
was
smoothing
her
hair
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
red
just
now
she
seemed
as
remarkable
to
him
as
she
had
seemed
that
first
day
years
ago
when
in
a
red
cape
he
had
seen
her
a
girl
of
sixteen
running
up
the
steps
of
her
father
house
in
philadelphia
she
was
so
wonderful
then
it
mellowed
his
mood
toward
her
that
all
you
know
about
it
you
liar
she
declared
it
little
you
know
what
i
know
i
have
had
detectives
on
your
trail
for
weeks
for
nothing
you
sneak
you
like
to
smooth
around
now
and
find
out
what
i
know
well
i
know
enough
let
me
tell
you
that
you
fool
me
any
longer
with
your
rita
sohlbergs
and
your
antoinette
nowaks
and
your
apartments
and
your
houses
of
assignation
i
know
what
you
are
you
brute
and
after
all
your
protestations
of
love
for
me
ugh
she
turned
fiercely
to
her
task
while
cowperwood
stared
at
her
touched
by
her
passion
moved
by
her
force
it
was
fine
to
see
what
a
dramatic
animal
she
was
really
worthy
of
him
in
many
ways
aileen
he
said
softly
hoping
still
to
ingratiate
himself
by
degrees
please
do
be
so
bitter
toward
me
have
you
any
understanding
of
how
life
works
any
sympathy
with
it
i
thought
you
were
more
generous
more
tender
i
not
so
bad
he
eyed
her
thoughtfully
tenderly
hoping
to
move
her
through
her
love
for
him
sympathy
sympathy
she
turned
on
him
blazing
a
lot
you
know
about
sympathy
i
suppose
i
did
give
you
any
sympathy
when
you
were
in
the
penitentiary
in
philadelphia
did
i
a
lot
of
good
it
did
me
it
sympathy
bah
to
have
you
come
out
here
to
chicago
and
take
up
with
a
lot
of
prostitutes
cheap
stenographers
and
wives
of
musicians
you
have
given
me
a
lot
of
sympathy
have
you
with
that
woman
lying
in
the
next
room
to
prove
it
she
smoothed
her
lithe
waist
and
shook
her
shoulders
preparatory
to
putting
on
a
hat
and
adjusting
her
wrap
she
proposed
to
go
just
as
she
was
and
send
fadette
back
for
all
her
belongings
aileen
he
pleaded
determined
to
have
his
way
i
think
you
very
foolish
really
i
do
there
is
no
occasion
for
all
this
none
in
the
world
here
you
are
talking
at
the
top
of
your
voice
scandalizing
the
whole
neighborhood
fighting
leaving
the
house
it
abominable
i
do
want
you
to
do
it
you
love
me
yet
do
you
you
know
you
do
i
know
you
do
mean
all
you
say
you
ca
you
really
do
believe
that
i
have
ceased
to
love
you
do
you
aileen
love
fired
aileen
a
lot
you
know
about
love
a
lot
you
have
ever
loved
anybody
you
brute
i
know
how
you
love
i
thought
you
loved
me
once
humph
i
see
how
you
loved
me
just
as
you
loved
fifty
other
women
as
you
love
that
snippy
little
rita
sohlberg
in
the
next
room
the
cat
the
dirty
little
beast
the
way
you
love
antoinette
nowak
a
cheap
stenographer
bah
you
do
know
what
the
word
means
and
yet
her
voice
trailed
off
into
a
kind
of
sob
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
hot
angry
aching
cowperwood
saw
them
and
came
over
hoping
in
some
way
to
take
advantage
of
them
he
was
truly
sorry
now
anxious
to
make
her
feel
tender
toward
him
once
more
aileen
he
pleaded
please
do
be
so
bitter
you
should
be
so
hard
on
me
i
not
so
bad
are
you
going
to
be
reasonable
he
put
out
a
smoothing
hand
but
she
jumped
away
do
you
touch
me
you
brute
she
exclaimed
angrily
do
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
i
do
want
you
to
come
near
me
i
not
live
with
you
i
not
stay
in
the
same
house
with
you
and
your
mistresses
go
and
live
with
your
dear
darling
rita
on
the
north
side
if
you
want
to
i
do
care
i
suppose
you
been
in
the
next
room
comforting
her
the
beast
i
wish
i
had
killed
her
oh
god
she
tore
at
her
throat
in
a
violent
rage
trying
to
adjust
a
button
cowperwood
was
literally
astonished
never
had
he
seen
such
an
outburst
as
this
he
had
not
believed
aileen
to
be
capable
of
it
he
could
not
help
admiring
her
nevertheless
he
resented
the
brutality
of
her
assault
on
rita
and
on
his
own
promiscuous
tendency
and
this
feeling
vented
itself
in
one
last
unfortunate
remark
i
would
be
so
hard
on
mistresses
if
i
were
you
aileen
he
ventured
pleadingly
i
should
have
thought
your
own
experience
would
have
he
paused
for
he
saw
on
the
instant
that
he
was
making
a
grave
mistake
this
reference
to
her
past
as
a
mistress
was
crucial
on
the
instant
she
straightened
up
and
her
eyes
filled
with
a
great
pain
so
that
the
way
you
talk
to
me
is
it
she
asked
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
would
come
she
turned
to
a
tall
chest
of
drawers
as
high
as
her
breasts
laden
with
silverware
brushes
and
combs
and
putting
her
arms
down
she
laid
her
head
upon
them
and
began
to
cry
this
was
the
last
straw
he
was
throwing
up
her
lawless
girlhood
love
to
her
as
an
offense
oh
she
sobbed
and
shook
in
a
hopeless
wretched
paroxysm
cowperwood
came
over
quickly
he
was
distressed
pained
i
mean
that
aileen
he
explained
i
did
mean
it
in
that
way
not
at
all
you
rather
drew
that
out
of
me
but
i
did
mean
it
as
a
reproach
you
were
my
mistress
but
good
lord
i
never
loved
you
any
the
less
for
that
rather
more
you
know
i
did
i
want
you
to
believe
that
it
true
these
other
matters
have
been
so
important
to
me
they
really
have
he
looked
at
her
helplessly
as
she
moved
away
to
avoid
him
he
was
distressed
nonplussed
immensely
sorry
as
he
walked
to
the
center
of
the
room
again
she
suddenly
suffered
a
great
revulsion
of
feeling
but
only
in
the
direction
of
more
wrath
this
was
too
much
so
this
is
the
way
you
talk
to
me
she
exclaimed
after
all
i
have
done
for
you
you
say
that
to
me
after
i
waited
for
you
and
cried
over
you
when
you
were
in
prison
for
nearly
two
years
your
mistress
my
reward
is
it
oh
suddenly
she
observed
her
and
resenting
all
the
gifts
he
had
given
her
in
philadelphia
in
paris
in
rome
here
in
chicago
she
suddenly
threw
open
the
lid
and
grabbing
the
contents
by
handfuls
began
to
toss
them
toward
him
to
actually
throw
them
in
his
face
out
they
came
handfuls
of
gauds
that
he
had
given
her
in
real
affection
a
jade
necklace
and
bracelet
of
pale
set
in
spun
gold
with
clasps
of
white
ivory
a
necklace
of
pearls
assorted
as
to
size
and
matched
in
color
that
shone
with
a
tinted
pearly
flame
in
the
evening
light
a
handful
of
rings
and
brooches
diamonds
rubies
opals
amethysts
a
of
emeralds
and
a
diamond
she
flung
them
at
him
excitedly
strewing
the
floor
striking
him
on
the
neck
the
face
the
hands
take
that
and
that
and
that
there
they
are
i
do
want
anything
more
of
yours
i
do
want
anything
more
to
do
with
you
i
do
want
anything
that
belongs
to
you
thank
god
i
have
money
enough
of
my
own
to
live
on
i
hate
you
i
despise
you
i
never
want
to
see
you
any
more
oh
and
trying
to
think
of
something
more
but
failing
she
dashed
swiftly
down
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
while
he
stood
for
just
one
moment
overwhelmed
then
he
hurried
after
aileen
he
called
aileen
come
back
here
do
go
aileen
but
she
only
hurried
faster
she
opened
and
closed
the
door
and
actually
ran
out
in
the
dark
her
eyes
wet
her
heart
bursting
so
this
was
the
end
of
that
youthful
dream
that
had
begun
so
beautifully
she
was
no
better
than
the
others
just
one
of
his
mistresses
to
have
her
past
thrown
up
to
her
as
a
defense
for
the
others
to
be
told
that
she
was
no
better
than
they
this
was
the
last
straw
she
choked
and
sobbed
as
she
walked
vowing
never
to
return
never
to
see
him
any
more
but
as
she
did
so
cowperwood
came
running
after
determined
for
once
as
lawless
as
he
was
that
this
should
not
be
the
end
of
it
all
she
had
loved
him
he
reflected
she
had
laid
every
gift
of
passion
and
affection
on
the
altar
of
her
love
it
was
fair
really
she
must
be
made
to
stay
he
caught
up
at
last
reaching
her
under
the
dark
of
the
november
trees
aileen
he
said
laying
hold
of
her
and
putting
his
arms
around
her
waist
aileen
dearest
this
is
plain
madness
it
is
insanity
you
not
in
your
right
mind
do
go
do
leave
me
i
love
you
do
you
know
i
do
ca
you
really
see
that
do
run
away
like
this
and
do
cry
i
do
love
you
and
you
know
it
i
always
shall
come
back
now
kiss
me
i
do
better
really
i
will
give
me
another
chance
wait
and
see
come
now
wo
you
that
my
girl
my
aileen
do
come
please
she
pulled
on
but
he
held
her
smoothing
her
arms
her
neck
her
face
aileen
he
entreated
she
tugged
so
that
he
was
finally
compelled
to
work
her
about
into
his
arms
then
sobbing
she
stood
there
agonized
but
happy
once
more
in
a
way
but
i
do
want
to
she
protested
you
do
love
me
any
more
let
me
go
but
he
kept
hold
of
her
urging
and
finally
she
said
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
as
of
old
do
make
me
come
back
i
do
want
to
i
ca
let
me
go
i
come
back
later
maybe
then
i
go
with
you
he
said
endearingly
it
is
right
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
should
be
doing
to
stop
this
scandal
but
go
and
together
they
sought
a
chapter
xx
man
and
superman
it
is
a
sad
commentary
on
all
save
the
most
chemic
unions
those
dark
red
flowers
of
romance
that
bloom
most
often
only
for
a
tragic
end
that
they
can
not
endure
the
storms
of
disaster
that
are
wont
to
overtake
them
a
woman
like
rita
sohlberg
with
a
seemingly
urgent
feeling
for
cowperwood
was
yet
not
so
charmed
by
him
but
that
this
shock
to
her
pride
was
a
marked
sedative
the
crushing
weight
of
such
an
exposure
as
this
the
homeric
laughter
inherent
if
not
indicated
in
the
faulty
planning
the
failure
to
take
into
account
beforehand
all
the
possibilities
which
might
lead
to
such
a
disaster
was
too
much
for
her
to
endure
she
was
stung
almost
to
desperation
maddened
at
the
thought
of
the
gay
idle
way
in
which
she
had
walked
into
cowperwood
clutches
and
been
made
into
a
spectacle
and
a
by
her
what
a
brute
she
was
what
a
demon
her
own
physical
weakness
under
the
circumstances
was
no
grief
to
her
rather
a
salve
to
her
superior
disposition
but
just
the
same
she
had
been
badly
beaten
her
beauty
turned
into
a
ragamuffin
show
and
that
was
enough
this
evening
in
the
lake
shore
sanitarium
where
she
had
been
taken
she
had
but
one
thought
to
get
away
when
it
should
all
be
over
and
rest
her
wearied
brain
she
did
not
want
to
see
sohlberg
any
more
she
did
not
want
to
see
cowperwood
any
more
already
harold
suspicious
and
determined
to
get
at
the
truth
was
beginning
to
question
her
as
to
the
strangeness
of
aileen
attack
her
probable
reason
when
cowperwood
was
announced
sohlberg
manner
modified
somewhat
for
whatever
his
suspicions
were
he
was
not
prepared
to
quarrel
with
this
singular
man
as
yet
i
am
so
sorry
about
this
unfortunate
business
said
cowperwood
coming
in
with
brisk
assurance
i
never
knew
my
wife
to
become
so
strangely
unbalanced
before
it
was
most
fortunate
that
i
arrived
when
i
did
i
certainly
owe
you
both
every
amend
that
can
be
made
i
sincerely
hope
sohlberg
that
you
are
not
seriously
injured
if
there
is
anything
i
can
possibly
do
anything
either
of
you
can
suggest
he
looked
around
solicitously
at
sohlberg
i
shall
only
be
too
glad
to
do
it
how
would
it
do
for
you
to
take
sohlberg
away
for
a
little
while
for
a
rest
i
shall
so
gladly
pay
all
expenses
in
connection
with
her
recovery
sohlberg
brooding
and
heavy
remained
unresponsive
smoldering
rita
cheered
by
cowperwood
presence
but
not
wholly
relieved
by
any
means
was
questioning
and
disturbed
she
was
afraid
there
was
to
be
a
terrific
scene
between
them
she
declared
she
was
better
and
would
be
all
right
that
she
did
not
need
to
go
away
but
that
she
preferred
to
be
alone
it
very
strange
said
sohlberg
sullenly
after
a
little
while
i
daunt
onderstand
it
i
daunt
onderstand
it
at
all
why
should
she
do
soach
a
thing
why
should
she
say
soach
things
here
we
have
been
the
best
of
friends
opp
to
now
then
suddenly
she
attacks
my
wife
and
sais
all
these
strange
things
but
i
have
assured
you
my
dear
sohlberg
that
my
wife
was
not
in
her
right
mind
she
has
been
subject
to
spells
of
this
kind
in
the
past
though
never
to
anything
so
violent
as
this
already
she
has
recovered
her
normal
state
and
she
does
not
remember
but
perhaps
if
we
are
going
to
discuss
things
now
we
had
better
go
out
in
the
hall
your
wife
will
need
all
the
rest
she
can
get
once
outside
cowperwood
continued
with
brilliant
assurance
now
my
dear
sohlberg
what
is
it
i
can
say
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
my
wife
has
made
a
lot
of
groundless
charges
to
say
nothing
of
injuring
your
wife
most
seriously
and
shamefully
i
can
not
tell
you
as
i
have
said
how
sorry
i
am
i
assure
you
cowperwood
is
suffering
from
a
gross
illusion
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
say
so
far
as
i
can
see
but
to
let
the
whole
matter
drop
do
you
agree
with
me
harold
was
twisting
mentally
in
the
coils
of
a
trying
situation
his
own
position
as
he
knew
was
not
formidable
rita
had
reproached
him
over
and
over
for
infidelity
he
began
to
swell
and
bluster
at
once
that
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
cowperwood
he
commented
defiantly
but
how
about
me
where
do
i
come
in
i
daunt
know
what
to
theenk
yet
it
ees
very
strange
supposing
what
your
wife
sais
was
true
supposing
my
wife
has
been
going
around
weeth
some
one
that
ees
what
i
want
to
find
out
eef
she
has
eef
eet
is
what
i
theenk
it
ees
i
shall
i
shall
i
daunt
know
what
i
shall
do
i
am
a
very
violent
man
cowperwood
almost
smiled
concerned
as
he
was
over
avoiding
publicity
he
had
no
fear
of
sohlberg
physically
see
here
he
exclaimed
suddenly
looking
sharply
at
the
musician
and
deciding
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
you
are
in
quite
as
delicate
a
situation
as
i
am
if
you
only
stop
to
think
this
affair
if
it
gets
out
will
involve
not
only
me
and
cowperwood
but
yourself
and
your
wife
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
think
your
own
affairs
are
not
in
any
too
good
shape
you
can
not
blacken
your
wife
without
blackening
yourself
that
is
inevitable
none
of
us
is
exactly
perfect
for
myself
i
shall
be
compelled
to
prove
insanity
and
i
can
do
this
easily
if
there
is
anything
in
your
past
which
is
not
precisely
what
it
should
be
it
could
not
long
be
kept
a
secret
if
you
are
willing
to
let
the
matter
drop
i
will
make
handsome
provision
for
you
both
if
instead
you
choose
to
make
trouble
to
force
this
matter
into
the
daylight
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
protect
myself
to
put
as
good
a
face
on
this
matter
as
i
can
what
exclaimed
sohlberg
you
threaten
me
you
try
to
frighten
me
after
your
wife
charges
that
you
have
been
running
around
weeth
my
wife
you
talk
about
my
past
i
like
that
haw
we
shall
see
about
dis
what
is
it
you
knaw
about
me
well
sohlberg
rejoined
cowperwood
calmly
i
know
for
instance
that
for
a
long
while
your
wife
has
not
loved
you
that
you
have
been
living
on
her
as
any
pensioner
might
that
you
have
been
running
around
with
as
many
as
six
or
seven
women
in
as
many
years
or
less
for
months
i
have
been
acting
as
your
wife
financial
adviser
and
in
that
time
with
the
aid
of
detectives
i
have
learned
of
anna
stelmak
jessie
laska
bertha
reese
georgia
du
coin
do
i
need
to
say
any
more
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
a
number
of
your
letters
in
my
possession
saw
that
ees
it
exclaimed
sohlberg
while
cowperwood
eyed
him
fixedly
you
have
been
running
around
weeth
my
wife
eet
ees
true
then
a
fine
situation
and
you
come
here
now
weeth
these
threats
these
lies
to
booldoze
me
haw
we
weel
see
about
them
we
weel
see
what
i
can
do
wait
teel
i
can
consult
a
lawyer
first
then
we
weel
see
cowperwood
surveyed
him
coldly
angrily
what
an
ass
he
thought
see
here
he
said
urging
sohlberg
for
privacy
sake
to
come
down
into
the
lower
hall
and
then
into
the
street
before
the
sanitarium
where
two
were
fluttering
fitfully
in
the
dark
and
wind
i
see
very
plainly
that
you
are
bent
on
making
trouble
it
is
not
enough
that
i
have
assured
you
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
that
i
have
given
you
my
word
you
insist
on
going
further
very
well
then
supposing
for
argument
sake
that
cowperwood
was
not
insane
that
every
word
she
said
was
true
that
i
had
been
misconducting
myself
with
your
wife
what
of
it
what
will
you
do
he
looked
at
sohlberg
smoothly
ironically
while
the
latter
flared
up
haw
he
shouted
melodramatically
why
i
would
keel
you
what
i
would
do
i
would
keel
her
i
weel
make
a
terrible
scene
just
let
me
knaw
that
this
is
so
and
then
see
exactly
replied
cowperwood
grimly
i
thought
so
i
believe
you
for
that
reason
i
have
come
prepared
to
serve
you
in
just
the
way
you
wish
he
reached
in
his
coat
and
took
out
two
small
revolvers
which
he
had
taken
from
a
drawer
at
home
for
this
very
purpose
they
gleamed
in
the
dark
do
you
see
these
he
continued
i
am
going
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
further
investigation
sohlberg
every
word
that
cowperwood
said
and
i
am
saying
this
with
a
full
understanding
of
what
this
means
to
you
and
to
me
is
true
she
is
no
more
insane
than
i
am
your
wife
has
been
living
in
an
apartment
with
me
on
the
north
side
for
months
though
you
can
not
prove
that
she
does
not
love
you
but
me
now
if
you
want
to
kill
me
here
is
a
gun
he
extended
his
hand
take
your
choice
if
i
am
to
die
you
might
as
well
die
with
me
he
said
it
so
coolly
so
firmly
that
sohlberg
who
was
an
innate
coward
and
who
had
no
more
desire
to
die
than
any
other
healthy
animal
paled
the
look
of
cold
steel
was
too
much
the
hand
that
pressed
them
on
him
was
hard
and
firm
he
took
hold
of
one
but
his
fingers
trembled
the
steely
metallic
voice
in
his
ear
was
undermining
the
little
courage
that
he
had
cowperwood
by
now
had
taken
on
the
proportions
of
a
dangerous
man
the
lineaments
of
a
demon
he
turned
away
mortally
terrified
my
god
he
exclaimed
shaking
like
a
leaf
you
want
to
keel
me
do
you
i
weel
not
have
anything
to
do
with
you
i
weel
not
talk
to
you
i
weel
see
my
lawyer
i
weel
talk
to
my
wife
first
oh
no
you
wo
replied
cowperwood
intercepting
him
as
he
turned
to
go
and
seizing
him
firmly
by
the
arm
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
am
not
going
to
kill
you
if
you
are
not
going
to
kill
me
but
i
am
going
to
make
you
listen
to
reason
for
once
now
here
is
what
else
i
have
to
say
and
then
i
am
through
i
am
not
unfriendly
to
you
i
want
to
do
you
a
good
turn
little
as
i
care
for
you
to
begin
with
there
is
nothing
in
those
charges
my
wife
made
not
a
thing
i
merely
said
what
i
did
just
now
to
see
if
you
were
in
earnest
you
do
not
love
your
wife
any
more
she
does
love
you
you
are
no
good
to
her
now
i
have
a
very
friendly
proposition
to
make
to
you
if
you
want
to
leave
chicago
and
stay
away
three
years
or
more
i
will
see
that
you
are
paid
five
thousand
dollars
every
year
on
january
first
on
the
nail
five
thousand
dollars
do
you
hear
or
you
can
stay
here
in
chicago
and
hold
your
tongue
and
i
will
make
it
three
thousand
monthly
or
yearly
just
as
you
please
but
and
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
remember
if
you
do
get
out
of
town
or
hold
your
tongue
if
you
make
one
single
rash
move
against
me
i
will
kill
you
and
i
will
kill
you
on
sight
now
i
want
you
to
go
away
from
here
and
behave
yourself
leave
your
wife
alone
come
and
see
me
in
a
day
or
two
the
money
is
ready
for
you
any
time
he
paused
while
sohlberg
stared
his
eyes
round
and
glassy
this
was
the
most
astonishing
experience
of
his
life
this
man
was
either
devil
or
prince
or
both
good
god
he
thought
he
will
do
that
too
he
will
really
kill
me
then
the
astounding
alternative
five
thousand
dollars
a
year
came
to
his
mind
well
why
not
his
silence
gave
consent
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
again
continued
cowperwood
sternly
do
disturb
her
she
needs
rest
go
on
and
come
and
see
me
or
if
you
want
to
go
back
i
will
go
with
you
i
want
to
say
to
sohlberg
what
i
have
said
to
you
but
remember
what
i
told
you
nau
thank
you
replied
sohlberg
feebly
i
will
go
good
night
and
he
hurried
away
i
sorry
said
cowperwood
to
himself
defensively
it
is
too
bad
but
it
was
the
only
way
chapter
xxi
a
matter
of
tunnels
the
question
of
sohlberg
adjusted
thus
simply
if
brutally
cowperwood
turned
his
attention
to
sohlberg
but
there
was
nothing
much
to
be
done
he
explained
that
he
had
now
completely
subdued
aileen
and
sohlberg
that
the
latter
would
make
no
more
trouble
that
he
was
going
to
pension
him
that
aileen
would
remain
permanently
quiescent
he
expressed
the
greatest
solicitude
for
her
but
rita
was
now
sickened
of
this
tangle
she
had
loved
him
as
she
thought
but
through
the
rage
of
aileen
she
saw
him
in
a
different
light
and
she
wanted
to
get
away
his
money
plentiful
as
it
was
did
not
mean
as
much
to
her
as
it
might
have
meant
to
some
women
it
simply
spelled
luxuries
without
which
she
could
exist
if
she
must
his
charm
for
her
had
perhaps
consisted
mostly
in
the
atmosphere
of
flawless
security
which
seemed
to
surround
him
a
glittering
bubble
of
romance
that
by
one
fell
attack
was
now
burst
he
was
seen
to
be
quite
as
other
men
subject
to
the
same
storms
the
same
danger
of
shipwreck
only
he
was
a
better
sailor
than
most
she
recuperated
gradually
left
for
home
left
for
europe
details
too
long
to
be
narrated
sohlberg
after
much
meditating
and
fuming
finally
accepted
the
offer
of
cowperwood
and
returned
to
denmark
aileen
after
a
few
days
of
quarreling
in
which
he
agreed
to
dispense
with
antoinette
nowak
returned
home
cowperwood
was
in
no
wise
pleased
by
this
rough
denouement
aileen
had
not
raised
her
own
attractions
in
his
estimation
and
yet
strange
to
relate
he
was
not
unsympathetic
with
her
he
had
no
desire
to
desert
her
as
yet
though
for
some
time
he
had
been
growing
in
the
feeling
that
rita
would
have
been
a
much
better
type
of
wife
for
him
but
what
he
could
not
have
he
could
not
have
he
turned
his
attention
with
renewed
force
to
his
business
but
it
was
with
many
a
backward
glance
at
those
radiant
hours
when
with
rita
in
his
presence
or
enfolded
by
his
arms
he
had
seen
life
from
a
new
and
poetic
angle
she
was
so
charming
so
naive
but
what
could
he
do
for
several
years
thereafter
cowperwood
was
busy
following
the
chicago
situation
with
increasing
interest
he
knew
it
was
useless
to
brood
over
rita
sohlberg
she
would
not
return
and
yet
he
could
not
help
it
but
he
could
work
hard
and
that
was
something
his
natural
aptitude
and
affection
for
work
had
long
since
been
demonstrated
and
it
was
now
making
him
restless
one
might
have
said
of
him
quite
truly
that
the
tinkle
of
and
the
plop
of
plodding
horses
feet
was
in
his
blood
he
surveyed
these
extending
lines
with
their
jingling
cars
as
he
went
about
the
city
with
an
almost
hungry
eye
chicago
was
growing
fast
and
these
little
on
certain
streets
were
crowded
night
and
morning
fairly
bulging
with
people
at
the
if
he
could
only
secure
an
on
one
or
all
of
them
if
he
could
combine
and
control
them
all
what
a
fortune
that
if
nothing
else
might
salve
him
for
some
of
his
woes
a
tremendous
fortune
nothing
less
he
forever
busied
himself
with
various
aspects
of
the
scene
quite
as
a
poet
might
have
concerned
himself
with
rocks
and
rills
to
own
these
to
own
these
so
rang
the
song
of
his
mind
like
the
gas
situation
the
chicago
situation
was
divided
into
three
parts
three
companies
representing
and
corresponding
with
the
three
different
sides
or
divisions
of
the
city
the
chicago
city
railway
company
occupying
the
south
side
and
extending
as
far
south
as
street
had
been
organized
in
and
represented
in
itself
a
mine
of
wealth
already
it
controlled
some
seventy
miles
of
track
and
was
annually
being
added
to
on
indiana
avenue
on
wabash
avenue
on
state
street
and
on
archer
avenue
it
owned
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
cars
of
the
type
and
over
one
thousand
horses
it
employed
one
hundred
and
seventy
conductors
one
hundred
and
sixty
drivers
a
hundred
stablemen
and
blacksmiths
and
repairers
in
interesting
numbers
its
were
busy
on
the
street
in
winter
its
in
summer
cowperwood
calculated
its
shares
bonds
and
other
physical
properties
as
totaling
in
the
vicinity
of
over
two
million
dollars
the
trouble
with
this
company
was
that
its
outstanding
stock
was
principally
controlled
by
norman
schryhart
who
was
now
decidedly
inimical
to
cowperwood
or
anything
he
might
wish
to
do
and
by
anson
merrill
who
had
never
manifested
any
signs
of
friendship
he
did
not
see
how
he
was
to
get
control
of
this
property
its
shares
were
selling
around
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
north
chicago
city
railway
was
a
corporation
which
had
been
organized
at
the
same
time
as
the
south
side
company
but
by
a
different
group
of
men
its
management
was
old
indifferent
and
incompetent
its
equipment
about
the
same
the
chicago
west
division
railway
had
originally
been
owned
by
the
chicago
city
or
south
side
railway
but
was
now
a
separate
corporation
it
was
not
yet
so
profitable
as
the
other
divisions
of
the
city
but
all
sections
of
the
city
were
growing
the
was
heard
everywhere
tinkling
gaily
standing
on
the
outside
of
this
scene
contemplating
its
promise
cowperwood
much
more
than
any
one
else
connected
financially
with
the
future
of
these
railways
at
this
time
was
impressed
with
their
enormous
possibilities
their
enormous
future
if
chicago
continued
to
grow
and
was
concerned
with
the
various
factors
which
might
further
or
impede
their
progress
not
long
before
he
had
discovered
that
one
of
the
chief
handicaps
to
development
on
the
north
and
west
sides
lay
in
the
congestion
of
traffic
at
the
bridges
spanning
the
chicago
river
between
the
street
ends
that
abutted
on
it
and
connected
the
two
sides
of
the
city
ran
this
amazing
stream
dirty
odorous
picturesque
compact
of
a
heavy
delightful
constantly
crowding
and
moving
boat
traffic
which
kept
the
various
bridges
momentarily
turning
and
tied
up
the
street
traffic
on
either
side
of
the
river
until
it
seemed
at
times
as
though
the
tangle
of
teams
and
boats
would
never
any
more
be
straightened
out
it
was
lovely
human
natural
dickensesque
a
fit
subject
for
a
daumier
a
turner
or
a
whistler
the
idlest
of
judged
for
himself
when
the
boats
and
when
the
teams
should
be
made
to
wait
and
how
long
while
in
addition
to
the
regular
pedestrians
a
group
of
idlers
stood
at
gaze
fascinated
by
the
crowd
of
masts
the
crush
of
wagons
and
the
picturesque
tugs
in
the
foreground
below
cowperwood
as
he
sat
in
his
light
runabout
annoyed
by
a
delay
or
dashed
swiftly
forward
to
get
over
before
a
bridge
turned
had
long
since
noted
that
the
service
in
the
north
and
west
sides
was
badly
hampered
the
unbroken
south
side
unthreaded
by
a
river
had
no
such
problem
and
was
growing
rapidly
because
of
this
he
was
naturally
interested
to
observe
one
day
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
that
there
existed
in
two
places
under
the
chicago
river
in
the
first
place
at
la
salle
street
running
north
and
south
and
in
the
second
at
washington
street
running
east
and
west
two
now
soggy
and
tunnels
which
were
never
used
by
anybody
dark
dank
dripping
affairs
only
vaguely
lighted
with
and
oozing
with
water
upon
investigation
he
learned
that
they
had
been
built
years
before
to
accommodate
this
same
tide
of
wagon
traffic
which
now
congested
at
the
bridges
and
which
even
then
had
been
rapidly
rising
being
forced
to
pay
a
toll
in
time
to
which
a
slight
toll
in
cash
exacted
for
the
privilege
of
using
a
tunnel
had
seemed
to
the
investors
and
public
infinitely
to
be
preferred
this
traffic
had
been
offered
this
opportunity
of
avoiding
the
delay
however
like
many
another
handsome
commercial
scheme
on
paper
or
bubbling
in
the
human
brain
the
plan
did
not
work
exactly
these
tunnels
might
have
proved
profitable
if
they
had
been
properly
built
with
long
grades
wide
roadways
and
a
sufficiency
of
light
and
air
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
not
been
judiciously
adapted
to
public
convenience
norman
schryhart
father
had
been
an
investor
in
these
tunnels
and
anson
merrill
when
they
had
proved
unprofitable
after
a
long
period
of
pointless
manipulation
cost
one
million
dollars
they
had
been
sold
to
the
city
for
exactly
that
sum
each
it
being
poetically
deemed
that
a
growing
city
could
better
afford
to
lose
so
disturbing
an
amount
than
any
of
its
humble
ambitious
and
respectable
citizens
that
was
a
little
affair
by
which
members
of
council
had
profited
years
before
but
that
also
is
another
story
after
discovering
these
tunnels
cowperwood
walked
through
them
several
times
for
though
they
were
now
boarded
up
there
was
still
an
uninterrupted
footpath
and
wondered
why
they
could
not
be
utilized
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
the
traffic
were
heavy
enough
profitable
enough
and
these
tunnels
for
a
reasonable
sum
could
be
made
into
a
lower
grade
one
of
the
problems
which
now
hampered
the
growth
of
the
north
and
west
sides
would
be
obviated
but
how
he
did
not
own
the
tunnels
he
did
not
own
the
the
cost
of
leasing
and
rebuilding
the
tunnels
would
be
enormous
helpers
and
horses
and
extra
drivers
on
any
grade
however
slight
would
have
to
be
used
and
that
meant
an
extra
expense
with
horses
as
the
only
means
of
traction
and
with
the
long
expensive
grades
he
was
not
so
sure
that
this
venture
would
be
a
profitable
one
however
in
the
fall
of
or
a
little
earlier
when
he
was
still
very
much
entangled
with
the
preliminary
sex
affairs
that
led
eventually
to
rita
sohlberg
he
became
aware
of
a
new
system
of
traction
relating
to
which
together
with
the
arrival
of
the
the
telephone
and
other
inventions
seemed
destined
to
change
the
character
of
city
life
entirely
recently
in
san
francisco
where
the
presence
of
hills
made
the
movement
of
crowded
cars
exceedingly
difficult
a
new
type
of
traction
had
been
introduced
that
of
the
cable
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
traveling
rope
of
wire
running
over
guttered
wheels
in
a
conduit
and
driven
by
immense
engines
conveniently
located
in
adjacent
stations
or
the
cars
carried
a
readily
manipulated
or
steel
hand
which
reached
down
through
a
slot
into
a
conduit
and
gripped
the
moving
cable
this
invention
solved
the
problem
of
hauling
heavily
laden
up
and
down
steep
grades
about
the
same
time
he
also
heard
in
a
roundabout
way
that
the
chicago
city
railway
of
which
schryhart
and
merrill
were
the
principal
owners
was
about
to
introduce
this
mode
of
traction
on
its
lines
to
cable
state
street
and
attach
the
cars
of
other
lines
running
farther
out
into
unprofitable
districts
as
trailers
at
once
the
solution
of
the
north
and
west
side
problems
flashed
upon
him
cables
outside
of
the
bridge
crush
and
the
tunnels
above
mentioned
there
was
one
other
special
condition
which
had
been
for
some
time
past
attracting
cowperwood
attention
this
was
the
waning
energy
of
the
north
chicago
city
railway
company
the
lack
of
foresight
on
the
part
of
its
directors
which
prevented
them
from
perceiving
the
proper
solution
of
their
difficulties
the
road
was
in
a
rather
unsatisfactory
state
financially
really
open
to
a
coup
of
some
sort
in
the
beginning
it
had
been
considered
unprofitable
so
thinly
populated
was
the
territory
they
served
and
so
short
the
distance
from
the
business
heart
later
however
as
the
territory
filled
up
they
did
better
only
then
the
long
waits
at
the
bridges
occurred
the
management
feeling
that
the
lines
were
likely
to
be
poorly
patronized
had
put
down
poor
little
rails
and
run
slimpsy
cars
which
were
as
cold
as
ice
in
winter
and
as
hot
as
in
summer
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
extend
the
terminus
of
the
several
lines
into
the
business
center
they
stopped
just
over
the
river
which
bordered
it
at
the
north
on
the
south
side
schryhart
had
done
much
better
for
his
patrons
he
had
already
installed
a
loop
for
his
cable
about
merrill
store
as
on
the
west
side
straw
was
strewn
in
the
bottom
of
all
the
cars
in
winter
to
keep
the
feet
of
the
passengers
warm
and
but
few
open
cars
were
used
in
summer
the
directors
were
averse
to
introducing
them
because
of
the
expense
so
they
had
gone
on
and
on
adding
lines
only
where
they
were
sure
they
would
make
a
good
profit
from
the
start
putting
down
the
same
style
of
cheap
rail
that
had
been
used
in
the
beginning
and
employing
the
same
antique
type
of
car
which
rattled
and
trembled
as
it
ran
until
the
patrons
were
enraged
to
the
point
of
anarchy
only
recently
because
of
various
suits
and
complaints
inaugurated
the
company
had
been
greatly
annoyed
but
they
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
how
to
meet
the
onslaught
though
there
was
here
and
there
a
man
of
sense
such
as
terrence
mulgannon
the
general
superintendent
edwin
kaffrath
a
director
william
johnson
the
constructing
engineer
of
the
company
yet
such
other
men
as
onias
skinner
the
president
and
walter
parker
the
were
reactionaries
of
an
elderly
character
conservative
meditative
stingy
and
worst
of
all
fearful
or
without
courage
for
great
adventure
it
is
a
sad
commentary
that
age
almost
invariably
takes
away
the
incentive
to
new
achievement
and
makes
let
well
enough
alone
the
most
appealing
motto
mindful
of
this
cowperwood
with
a
now
splendid
scheme
in
his
mind
one
day
invited
john
mckenty
over
to
his
house
to
dinner
on
a
social
pretext
when
the
latter
accompanied
by
his
wife
had
arrived
and
aileen
had
smiled
on
them
both
sweetly
and
was
doing
her
best
to
be
nice
to
mckenty
cowperwood
remarked
mckenty
do
you
know
anything
about
these
two
tunnels
that
the
city
owns
under
the
river
at
washington
and
la
salle
streets
i
know
that
the
city
took
them
over
when
it
did
need
them
and
that
they
no
good
for
anything
that
was
before
my
time
though
explained
mckenty
cautiously
i
think
the
city
paid
a
million
for
them
why
oh
nothing
much
replied
cowperwood
evading
the
matter
for
the
present
i
was
wondering
whether
they
were
in
such
condition
that
they
could
be
used
for
anything
i
see
occasional
references
in
the
papers
to
their
uselessness
they
in
pretty
bad
shape
i
afraid
replied
mckenty
i
been
through
either
of
them
in
years
and
years
the
idea
was
originally
to
let
the
wagons
go
through
them
and
break
up
the
crowding
at
the
bridges
but
it
did
work
they
made
the
grade
too
steep
and
the
tolls
too
high
and
so
the
drivers
preferred
to
wait
for
the
bridges
they
were
pretty
hard
on
horses
i
can
testify
to
that
myself
i
driven
a
through
them
more
than
once
the
city
should
never
have
taken
them
over
at
all
by
rights
it
was
a
deal
i
do
know
who
all
was
in
it
carmody
was
mayor
then
and
aldrich
was
in
charge
of
public
works
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
cowperwood
allowed
the
matter
of
the
tunnels
to
rest
until
after
dinner
when
they
had
adjourned
to
the
library
there
he
placed
a
friendly
hand
on
mckenty
arm
an
act
of
familiarity
which
the
politician
rather
liked
you
felt
pretty
well
satisfied
with
the
way
that
gas
business
came
out
last
year
did
you
he
inquired
i
did
replied
mckenty
warmly
never
more
so
i
told
you
that
at
the
time
the
irishman
liked
cowperwood
and
was
grateful
for
the
swift
manner
in
which
he
had
been
made
richer
by
the
sum
of
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
well
now
mckenty
continued
cowperwood
abruptly
and
with
a
seeming
lack
of
connection
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
things
are
shaping
up
for
a
big
change
in
the
situation
here
i
can
see
it
coming
there
going
to
be
a
new
motor
power
introduced
on
the
south
side
within
a
year
or
two
you
heard
of
it
i
read
something
of
it
replied
mckenty
surprised
and
a
little
questioning
he
took
a
cigar
and
prepared
to
listen
cowperwood
never
smoking
drew
up
a
chair
well
i
tell
you
what
that
means
he
explained
it
means
that
eventually
every
mile
of
track
in
this
city
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
additional
miles
that
will
be
built
before
this
change
takes
place
will
have
to
be
done
over
on
an
entirely
new
basis
i
mean
this
system
these
old
companies
that
are
hobbling
along
now
with
an
old
equipment
will
have
to
make
the
change
they
have
to
spend
millions
and
millions
before
they
can
bring
their
equipment
up
to
date
if
you
paid
any
attention
to
the
matter
you
must
have
seen
what
a
condition
these
north
and
west
side
lines
are
in
it
pretty
bad
i
know
that
commented
mckenty
just
so
replied
cowperwood
emphatically
well
now
if
i
know
anything
about
these
old
managements
from
studying
them
they
going
to
have
a
hard
time
bringing
themselves
to
do
this
two
to
three
million
are
two
to
three
million
and
it
is
going
to
be
an
easy
matter
for
them
to
raise
the
money
not
as
easy
perhaps
as
it
would
be
for
some
of
the
rest
of
us
supposing
we
wanted
to
go
into
the
business
yes
supposing
replied
mckenty
jovially
but
how
are
you
to
get
in
it
there
no
stock
for
sale
that
i
know
of
just
the
same
said
cowperwood
we
can
if
we
want
to
and
i
show
you
how
but
at
present
there
just
one
thing
in
particular
i
like
you
to
do
for
me
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
any
way
that
we
can
get
control
of
either
of
those
two
old
tunnels
that
i
was
talking
to
you
about
a
little
while
ago
i
like
both
if
i
might
do
you
suppose
that
is
possible
why
yes
replied
mckenty
wondering
but
what
have
they
got
to
do
with
it
they
not
worth
anything
some
of
the
boys
were
talking
about
filling
them
in
some
time
ago
blowing
them
up
the
police
think
crooks
hide
in
them
just
the
same
do
let
any
one
touch
them
do
lease
them
or
anything
replied
cowperwood
forcefully
i
tell
you
frankly
what
i
want
to
do
i
want
to
get
control
just
as
soon
as
possible
of
all
the
lines
i
can
on
the
north
and
west
sides
new
or
old
franchises
then
you
see
where
the
tunnels
come
in
he
paused
to
see
whether
mckenty
caught
the
point
of
all
he
meant
but
the
latter
failed
you
do
want
much
do
you
he
said
cheerfully
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
use
the
tunnels
however
that
no
reason
why
i
take
care
of
them
for
you
if
you
think
that
important
it
this
way
said
cowperwood
thoughtfully
i
make
you
a
preferred
partner
in
all
the
ventures
that
i
control
if
you
do
as
i
suggest
the
as
they
stand
now
will
have
to
be
taken
up
lock
stock
and
barrel
and
thrown
into
the
scrap
heap
within
eight
or
nine
years
at
the
latest
you
see
what
the
south
side
company
is
beginning
to
do
now
when
it
comes
to
the
west
and
north
side
companies
they
wo
find
it
so
easy
they
are
earning
as
much
as
the
south
side
and
besides
they
have
those
bridges
to
cross
that
means
a
severe
inconvenience
to
a
cable
line
in
the
first
place
the
bridges
will
have
to
be
rebuilt
to
stand
the
extra
weight
and
strain
now
the
question
arises
at
once
at
whose
expense
the
city
that
depends
on
who
asking
for
it
replied
mckenty
amiably
quite
so
assented
cowperwood
in
the
next
place
this
river
traffic
is
becoming
impossible
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
decent
service
there
are
waits
now
of
from
eight
to
fifteen
minutes
while
these
tows
and
vessels
get
through
chicago
has
five
hundred
thousand
population
how
much
will
it
have
in
in
how
will
it
be
when
it
has
eight
hundred
thousand
or
a
million
you
quite
right
interpolated
mckenty
it
will
be
pretty
bad
exactly
but
what
is
worse
the
cable
lines
will
carry
trailers
or
single
cars
from
feeder
lines
there
wo
be
single
cars
waiting
at
these
draws
there
will
be
trains
crowded
trains
it
wo
be
advisable
to
delay
a
from
eight
to
fifteen
minutes
while
boats
are
making
their
way
through
a
draw
the
public
wo
stand
for
that
very
long
will
it
do
you
think
not
without
making
a
row
probably
replied
mckenty
well
that
means
what
then
asked
cowperwood
is
the
traffic
going
to
get
any
lighter
is
the
river
going
to
dry
up
mckenty
stared
suddenly
his
face
lighted
oh
i
see
he
said
shrewdly
it
those
tunnels
you
thinking
about
are
they
in
any
shape
to
be
used
they
can
be
made
over
cheaper
than
new
ones
can
be
built
true
for
you
replied
mckenty
and
if
they
in
any
sort
of
repair
they
be
just
what
you
want
he
was
emphatic
almost
triumphant
they
belong
to
the
city
they
cost
pretty
near
a
million
apiece
those
things
i
know
it
said
cowperwood
now
do
you
see
what
i
driving
at
do
i
see
smiled
mckenty
that
a
real
idea
you
have
cowperwood
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
say
what
you
want
well
then
in
the
first
place
replied
cowperwood
genially
it
is
agreed
that
the
city
wo
part
with
those
two
tunnels
under
any
circumstances
until
we
can
see
what
can
be
done
about
this
other
matter
it
will
not
in
the
next
place
it
is
understood
is
it
that
you
wo
make
it
any
easier
than
you
can
possibly
help
for
the
north
and
west
side
companies
to
get
ordinances
extending
their
lines
or
anything
else
from
now
on
i
shall
want
to
introduce
some
franchises
for
feeders
and
outlying
lines
myself
bring
in
your
ordinances
replied
mckenty
and
i
do
whatever
you
say
i
worked
with
you
before
i
know
that
you
keep
your
word
thanks
said
cowperwood
warmly
i
know
the
value
of
keeping
it
in
the
mean
while
i
go
ahead
and
see
what
can
be
done
about
the
other
matter
i
do
know
just
how
many
men
i
will
need
to
let
in
on
this
or
just
what
form
the
organization
will
take
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
your
interests
will
be
properly
taken
care
of
and
that
whatever
is
done
will
be
done
with
your
full
knowledge
and
consent
all
very
good
answered
mckenty
thinking
of
the
new
field
of
activity
before
them
a
combination
between
himself
and
cowperwood
in
a
matter
like
this
must
prove
very
beneficial
to
both
and
he
was
satisfied
because
of
their
previous
relations
that
his
own
interests
would
not
be
neglected
shall
we
go
and
see
if
we
can
find
the
ladies
asked
cowperwood
jauntily
laying
hold
of
the
politician
arm
to
be
sure
assented
mckenty
gaily
it
a
fine
house
you
have
here
beautiful
and
your
wife
is
as
pretty
a
woman
as
i
ever
saw
if
you
pardon
the
familiarity
i
have
always
thought
she
was
rather
attractive
myself
replied
cowperwood
innocently
chapter
xxii
at
last
among
the
directors
of
the
north
chicago
city
company
there
was
one
man
edwin
kaffrath
who
was
young
and
of
a
temperament
his
father
a
former
heavy
stockholder
of
this
company
had
recently
died
and
left
all
his
holdings
and
practically
his
directorship
to
his
only
son
young
kaffrath
was
by
no
means
a
practical
man
though
he
fancied
he
could
do
very
well
at
it
if
given
a
chance
he
was
the
holder
of
nearly
eight
hundred
of
the
five
thousand
shares
of
stock
but
the
rest
of
it
was
so
divided
that
he
could
only
exercise
a
minor
influence
nevertheless
from
the
day
of
his
entrance
into
the
company
which
was
months
before
cowperwood
began
seriously
to
think
over
the
situation
he
had
been
strong
for
improvements
extensions
more
franchises
better
cars
better
horses
stoves
in
the
cars
in
winter
and
the
like
all
of
which
suggestions
sounded
to
his
like
mere
manifestations
of
the
reckless
impetuosity
of
youth
and
were
almost
uniformly
opposed
what
the
matter
with
them
cars
asked
albert
thorsen
one
of
the
elder
directors
at
one
of
the
meetings
at
which
kaffrath
was
present
and
offering
his
usual
protest
i
do
see
anything
the
matter
with
i
ride
in
em
thorsen
was
a
heavy
dusty
individual
of
who
was
a
little
dull
but
genial
he
was
in
the
paint
business
and
always
wore
a
very
light
suit
much
crinkled
in
the
seat
and
arms
perhaps
that
what
the
matter
with
them
albert
chirped
up
solon
kaempfaert
one
of
his
cronies
on
the
board
the
sally
drew
a
laugh
oh
i
do
know
i
see
the
rest
of
you
on
board
often
enough
why
i
tell
you
what
the
matter
with
them
replied
kaffrath
they
dirty
and
they
flimsy
and
the
windows
rattle
so
you
hear
yourself
think
the
track
is
no
good
and
the
filthy
straw
we
keep
in
them
in
winter
is
enough
to
make
a
person
sick
we
do
keep
the
track
in
good
repair
i
do
wonder
people
complain
complain
myself
oh
i
do
think
things
are
as
bad
as
all
that
put
in
onias
skinner
the
president
who
had
a
face
which
with
its
very
short
was
as
bland
as
a
chinese
god
he
was
years
of
age
they
not
the
best
cars
in
the
world
but
they
good
cars
they
need
painting
and
varnishing
pretty
badly
some
of
them
but
outside
of
that
there
many
a
good
year
wear
in
them
yet
be
very
glad
if
we
could
put
in
new
but
the
item
of
expense
will
be
considerable
it
these
extensions
that
we
have
to
keep
building
and
the
long
hauls
for
five
cents
which
eat
up
the
profits
the
long
hauls
were
only
two
or
three
miles
at
the
outside
but
they
seemed
long
to
skinner
well
look
at
the
south
side
persisted
kaffrath
i
do
know
what
you
people
are
thinking
of
here
a
cable
system
introduced
in
philadelphia
there
another
in
san
francisco
some
one
has
invented
a
car
as
i
understand
it
that
going
to
run
by
electricity
and
here
we
are
running
cars
barns
i
call
them
with
straw
in
them
good
lord
i
should
think
it
was
about
time
that
some
of
us
took
a
tumble
to
ourselves
oh
i
do
know
commented
skinner
it
seems
to
me
we
have
done
pretty
well
by
the
north
side
we
have
done
a
good
deal
directors
solon
kaempfaert
albert
thorsen
isaac
white
anthony
ewer
arnold
benjamin
and
otto
matjes
being
solemn
gentlemen
all
merely
sat
and
stared
the
vigorous
kaffrath
was
not
to
be
so
easily
repressed
however
he
repeated
his
complaints
on
other
occasions
the
fact
that
there
was
also
considerable
complaint
in
the
newspapers
from
time
to
time
in
regard
to
this
same
north
side
service
pleased
him
in
a
way
perhaps
this
would
be
the
proverbial
fire
under
the
terrapin
which
would
cause
it
to
move
along
by
this
time
owing
to
cowperwood
understanding
with
mckenty
all
possibility
of
the
north
side
company
securing
additional
franchises
for
unoccupied
streets
or
even
the
use
of
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
had
ended
kaffrath
did
not
know
this
neither
did
the
directors
or
officers
of
the
company
but
it
was
true
in
addition
mckenty
through
the
aldermen
who
were
at
his
beck
and
call
on
the
north
side
was
beginning
to
stir
up
additional
murmurs
and
complaints
in
order
to
discredit
the
present
management
there
was
a
great
in
council
over
a
motion
on
the
part
of
somebody
to
compel
the
north
side
company
to
throw
out
its
old
cars
and
lay
better
and
heavier
tracks
curiously
this
did
not
apply
so
much
to
the
west
and
south
sides
which
were
in
the
same
condition
the
rank
and
file
of
the
city
ignorant
of
the
tricks
which
were
constantly
being
employed
in
politics
to
effect
one
end
or
another
were
greatly
cheered
by
this
public
uprising
they
little
knew
the
pawns
they
were
in
the
game
or
how
little
sincerity
constituted
the
primal
impulse
quite
by
accident
apparently
one
day
addison
thinking
of
the
different
men
in
the
north
side
company
who
might
be
of
service
to
cowperwood
and
having
finally
picked
young
kaffrath
as
the
ideal
agent
introduced
himself
to
the
latter
at
the
union
league
that
a
pretty
heavy
load
of
expense
that
staring
you
north
and
west
side
people
in
the
face
he
took
occasion
to
observe
how
that
asked
kaffrath
curiously
anxious
to
hear
anything
which
concerned
the
development
of
the
business
well
unless
i
greatly
mistaken
you
all
of
you
are
going
to
be
put
to
the
expense
of
doing
over
your
lines
completely
in
a
very
little
while
so
i
hear
introducing
this
new
motor
or
cable
system
that
they
are
getting
on
the
south
side
addison
wanted
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
city
council
or
public
sentiment
or
something
was
going
to
force
the
north
chicago
company
to
indulge
in
this
great
and
expensive
series
of
improvements
kaffrath
pricked
up
his
ears
what
was
the
city
council
going
to
do
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
they
discussed
the
whole
situation
the
nature
of
the
the
cost
of
the
the
need
of
new
rails
and
the
necessity
of
heavier
bridges
or
some
other
means
of
getting
over
or
under
the
river
addison
took
very
good
care
to
point
out
that
the
chicago
city
or
south
side
railway
was
in
a
much
more
fortunate
position
than
either
of
the
other
two
by
reason
of
its
freedom
from
the
problem
then
he
again
commiserated
the
north
side
company
on
its
rather
difficult
position
your
company
will
have
a
very
great
deal
to
do
i
fancy
he
reiterated
kaffrath
was
duly
impressed
and
appropriately
depressed
for
his
eight
hundred
shares
would
be
depressed
in
value
by
the
necessity
of
heavy
expenditures
for
tunnels
and
other
improvements
nevertheless
there
was
some
consolation
in
the
thought
that
such
betterment
as
addison
now
described
would
in
the
long
run
make
the
lines
more
profitable
but
in
the
mean
time
there
might
be
rough
sailing
the
old
directors
ought
to
act
soon
now
he
thought
with
the
south
side
company
being
done
over
they
would
have
to
follow
suit
but
would
they
how
could
he
get
them
to
see
that
even
though
it
were
necessary
to
mortgage
the
lines
for
years
to
come
it
would
pay
in
the
long
run
he
was
sick
of
old
conservative
cautious
methods
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
weeks
addison
still
acting
for
cowperwood
had
a
second
and
private
conference
with
kaffrath
he
said
after
exacting
a
promise
of
secrecy
for
the
present
that
since
their
previous
conversation
he
had
become
aware
of
new
developments
in
the
interval
he
had
been
visited
by
several
men
of
long
connection
with
in
other
localities
they
had
been
visiting
various
cities
looking
for
a
convenient
outlet
for
their
capital
and
had
finally
picked
on
chicago
they
had
looked
over
the
various
lines
here
and
had
decided
that
the
north
chicago
city
railway
was
as
good
a
field
as
any
he
then
elaborated
with
exceeding
care
the
idea
which
cowperwood
had
outlined
to
him
kaffrath
dubious
at
first
was
finally
won
over
he
had
too
long
chafed
under
the
dusty
poky
attitude
of
the
old
regime
he
did
not
know
who
these
new
men
were
but
this
scheme
was
in
line
with
his
own
ideas
it
would
require
as
addison
pointed
out
the
expenditure
of
several
millions
of
dollars
and
he
did
not
see
how
the
money
could
be
raised
without
outside
assistance
unless
the
lines
were
heavily
mortgaged
if
these
new
men
were
willing
to
pay
a
high
rate
for
per
cent
of
this
stock
for
years
and
would
guarantee
a
satisfactory
rate
of
interest
on
all
the
stock
as
it
stood
besides
inaugurating
a
forward
policy
why
not
let
them
it
would
be
just
as
good
as
mortgaging
the
soul
out
of
the
old
property
and
the
management
was
of
no
value
anyhow
kaffrath
could
not
see
how
fortunes
were
to
be
made
for
these
new
investors
out
of
subsidiary
construction
and
equipment
companies
in
which
cowperwood
would
be
interested
how
by
issuing
watered
stock
on
the
old
and
new
lines
the
latter
need
scarcely
lay
down
a
dollar
once
he
had
the
necessary
opening
capital
the
talking
capital
as
he
was
fond
of
calling
it
guaranteed
cowperwood
and
addison
had
by
now
agreed
if
this
went
through
to
organize
the
chicago
trust
company
with
millions
back
of
it
to
manipulate
all
their
deals
kaffrath
only
saw
a
better
return
on
his
stock
possibly
a
chance
to
get
in
on
the
ground
plan
as
a
new
phrase
expressed
it
of
the
new
company
that
what
i
been
telling
these
fellows
for
the
past
three
years
he
finally
exclaimed
to
addison
flattered
by
the
latter
personal
attention
and
awed
by
his
great
influence
but
they
never
have
been
willing
to
listen
to
me
the
way
this
north
side
system
has
been
managed
is
a
crime
why
a
child
could
do
better
than
we
have
done
they
saved
on
track
and
and
lost
on
population
people
are
what
we
want
up
there
and
there
is
only
one
way
that
i
know
of
to
get
them
and
that
is
to
give
them
decent
car
service
i
tell
you
frankly
we
never
done
it
not
long
after
this
cowperwood
had
a
short
talk
with
kaffrath
in
which
he
promised
the
latter
not
only
six
hundred
dollars
a
share
for
all
the
stock
he
possessed
or
would
part
with
on
lease
but
a
bonus
of
new
company
stock
for
his
influence
kaffrath
returned
to
the
north
side
jubilant
for
himself
and
for
his
company
he
decided
after
due
thought
that
a
roundabout
way
would
best
serve
cowperwood
ends
a
line
of
subtle
suggestion
from
some
seemingly
disinterested
party
consequently
he
caused
william
johnson
the
directing
engineer
to
approach
albert
thorsen
one
of
the
most
vulnerable
of
the
directors
declaring
he
had
heard
privately
that
isaac
white
arnold
benjamin
and
otto
matjes
three
other
directors
and
the
heaviest
owners
had
been
offered
a
very
remarkable
price
for
their
stock
and
that
they
were
going
to
sell
leaving
the
others
out
in
the
cold
thorsen
was
beside
himself
with
grief
when
did
you
hear
that
he
asked
johnson
told
him
but
for
the
time
being
kept
the
source
of
his
information
secret
thorsen
at
once
hurried
to
his
friend
solon
kaempfaert
who
in
turn
went
to
kaffrath
for
information
i
have
heard
something
to
that
effect
was
kaffrath
only
comment
but
really
i
do
not
know
thereupon
thorsen
and
kaempfaert
imagined
that
kaffrath
was
in
the
conspiracy
to
sell
out
and
leave
them
with
no
particularly
valuable
pickings
it
was
very
sad
meanwhile
cowperwood
on
the
advice
of
kaffrath
was
approaching
isaac
white
arnold
benjamin
and
otto
matjes
direct
talking
with
them
as
if
they
were
the
only
three
he
desired
to
deal
with
a
little
later
thorsen
and
kaempfaert
were
visited
in
the
same
spirit
and
agreed
in
secret
fear
to
sell
out
or
rather
lease
at
the
very
advantageous
terms
cowperwood
offered
providing
he
could
get
the
others
to
do
likewise
this
gave
the
latter
a
strong
backing
of
sentiment
on
the
board
finally
isaac
white
stated
at
one
of
the
meetings
that
he
had
been
approached
with
an
interesting
proposition
which
he
then
and
there
outlined
he
was
not
sure
what
to
think
he
said
but
the
board
might
like
to
consider
it
at
once
thorsen
and
kaempfaert
were
convinced
that
all
johnson
had
suggested
was
true
it
was
decided
to
have
cowperwood
come
and
explain
to
the
full
board
just
what
his
plan
was
and
this
he
did
in
a
long
bland
smiling
talk
it
was
made
plain
that
the
road
would
have
to
be
put
in
shape
in
the
near
future
and
that
this
proposed
plan
relieved
all
of
them
of
work
worry
and
care
moreover
they
were
guaranteed
more
interest
at
once
than
they
had
expected
to
earn
in
the
next
twenty
or
thirty
years
thereupon
it
was
agreed
that
cowperwood
and
his
plan
should
be
given
a
trial
seeing
that
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
paying
the
proposed
interest
promptly
the
property
once
more
became
theirs
so
they
thought
and
that
he
assumed
all
obligations
taxes
water
rents
old
claims
a
few
pensions
it
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
rather
idyllic
scheme
well
boys
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
day
work
myself
observed
anthony
ewer
laying
a
friendly
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
albert
thorsen
i
sure
we
can
all
unite
in
wishing
cowperwood
luck
with
his
adventure
ewer
seven
hundred
and
fifteen
shares
worth
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
having
risen
to
a
valuation
of
four
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
he
was
naturally
jubilant
you
right
replied
thorsen
who
was
parting
with
four
hundred
and
eighty
shares
out
of
a
total
of
seven
hundred
and
ninety
and
seeing
them
all
bounce
in
value
from
two
hundred
to
six
hundred
dollars
he
an
interesting
man
i
hope
he
succeeds
cowperwood
waking
the
next
morning
in
aileen
room
he
had
been
out
late
the
night
before
with
mckenty
addison
videra
and
others
turned
and
patting
her
neck
where
she
was
dozing
said
well
pet
yesterday
afternoon
i
wound
up
that
north
chicago
street
railway
deal
president
of
the
new
north
side
company
just
as
soon
as
i
get
my
board
of
directors
organized
we
going
to
be
of
some
real
consequence
in
this
village
after
all
in
a
year
or
two
he
was
hoping
that
this
fact
among
other
things
would
end
in
mollifying
aileen
toward
him
she
had
been
so
gloomy
remote
weary
these
many
days
ever
since
the
terrific
assault
on
rita
yes
she
replied
with
a
smile
rubbing
her
waking
eyes
she
was
clad
in
a
foamy
nightgown
of
white
and
pink
that
nice
is
it
cowperwood
brought
himself
up
on
one
elbow
and
looked
at
her
smoothing
her
round
bare
arms
which
he
always
admired
the
luminous
richness
of
her
hair
had
never
lost
its
charm
completely
that
means
that
i
can
do
the
same
thing
with
the
chicago
west
division
company
in
a
year
or
so
he
went
on
but
there
going
to
be
a
lot
of
talk
about
this
i
afraid
and
i
do
want
that
just
now
it
will
work
out
all
right
i
can
see
schryhart
and
merrill
and
some
of
these
other
people
taking
notice
pretty
soon
they
missed
out
on
two
of
the
biggest
things
chicago
ever
had
gas
and
railways
oh
yes
frank
i
glad
for
you
commented
aileen
rather
drearily
who
in
spite
of
her
sorrow
over
his
defection
was
still
glad
that
he
was
going
on
and
forward
you
always
do
all
right
i
wish
you
would
feel
so
badly
aileen
he
said
with
a
kind
of
affectional
protest
are
you
going
to
try
and
be
happy
with
me
this
is
as
much
for
you
as
for
me
you
will
be
able
to
pay
up
old
scores
even
better
than
i
will
he
smiled
winningly
yes
she
replied
reproachfully
but
tenderly
at
that
a
little
sorrowfully
a
lot
of
good
money
does
me
it
was
your
love
i
wanted
but
you
have
that
he
insisted
i
told
you
that
over
and
over
i
never
ceased
to
care
for
you
really
you
know
i
did
yes
i
know
she
replied
even
as
he
gathered
her
close
in
his
arms
i
know
how
you
care
but
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
responding
to
him
warmly
for
back
of
all
her
fuming
protest
was
heartache
the
wish
to
have
his
love
intact
to
restore
that
pristine
affection
which
she
had
once
assumed
would
endure
forever
chapter

the
power
of
the
press
the
morning
papers
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
cowperwood
and
his
friends
to
keep
this
transfer
secret
shortly
thereafter
were
full
of
rumors
of
a
change
in
north
chicago
frank
algernon
cowperwood
hitherto
unmentioned
in
connection
with
chicago
was
pointed
to
as
the
probable
successor
to
onias
skinner
and
edwin
kaffrath
one
of
the
old
directors
as
future
the
men
back
of
the
deal
were
referred
to
as
in
all
likelihood
eastern
capitalists
cowperwood
as
he
sat
in
aileen
room
examining
the
various
morning
papers
saw
that
before
the
day
was
over
he
would
be
sought
out
for
an
expression
of
opinion
and
further
details
he
proposed
to
ask
the
newspaper
men
to
wait
a
few
days
until
he
could
talk
to
the
publishers
of
the
papers
themselves
win
their
confidence
and
then
announce
a
general
policy
it
would
be
something
that
would
please
the
city
and
the
residents
of
the
north
side
in
particular
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
care
to
promise
anything
which
he
could
not
easily
and
profitably
perform
he
wanted
fame
and
reputation
but
he
wanted
money
even
more
he
intended
to
get
both
to
one
who
had
been
working
thus
long
in
the
minor
realms
of
finance
as
cowperwood
considered
that
he
had
so
far
been
doing
this
sudden
upward
step
into
the
more
conspicuous
regions
of
high
finance
and
control
was
an
thing
so
long
had
he
been
stirring
about
in
a
lesser
region
paving
the
way
by
hours
and
hours
of
private
thought
and
conference
and
scheming
that
now
when
he
actually
had
achieved
his
end
he
could
scarcely
believe
for
the
time
being
that
it
was
true
chicago
was
such
a
splendid
city
it
was
growing
so
fast
its
opportunities
were
so
wonderful
these
men
who
had
thus
foolishly
parted
with
an
indefinite
lease
of
their
holdings
had
not
really
considered
what
they
were
doing
this
matter
of
chicago
once
he
had
them
well
in
hand
could
be
made
to
yield
such
splendid
profits
he
could
incorporate
and
overcapitalize
many
subsidiary
lines
which
mckenty
would
secure
for
him
for
a
song
would
be
worth
millions
in
the
future
and
they
should
be
his
entirely
he
would
not
be
indebted
to
the
directors
of
the
old
north
chicago
company
for
any
interest
on
those
by
degrees
year
by
year
as
the
city
grew
the
lines
which
were
still
controlled
by
this
old
company
but
were
practically
his
would
become
a
mere
item
a
central
core
in
the
so
very
much
larger
system
of
new
lines
which
he
would
build
up
about
it
then
the
west
side
and
even
the
south
side
sections
but
why
dream
he
might
readily
become
the
sole
master
of
traffic
in
chicago
he
might
readily
become
the
most
princely
financial
figure
in
the
city
and
one
of
the
few
great
financial
magnates
of
the
nation
in
any
public
enterprise
of
any
kind
as
he
knew
where
the
suffrages
of
the
people
or
the
privileges
in
their
possessions
are
desired
the
newspapers
must
always
be
considered
as
cowperwood
even
now
was
casting
hungry
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
two
tunnels
one
to
be
held
in
view
of
an
eventual
assumption
of
the
chicago
west
division
company
the
other
to
be
given
to
the
north
chicago
street
railway
which
he
had
now
organized
it
was
necessary
to
make
friends
with
the
various
publishers
how
to
go
about
it
recently
because
of
the
influx
of
a
heavy
native
and
population
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
looking
for
the
work
which
the
growth
of
the
city
seemed
to
promise
and
because
of
the
dissemination
of
stirring
ideas
through
radical
individuals
of
foreign
groups
concerning
anarchism
socialism
communism
and
the
like
the
civic
idea
in
chicago
had
become
most
acute
this
very
may
in
which
cowperwood
had
been
going
about
attempting
to
adjust
matters
in
his
favor
there
had
been
a
tremendous
national
when
in
a
great
public
place
on
the
west
side
known
as
the
haymarket
at
one
of
a
number
of
labor
meetings
dubbed
anarchistic
because
of
the
principles
of
some
of
the
speakers
a
bomb
had
been
hurled
by
some
excited
fanatic
which
had
exploded
and
maimed
or
killed
a
number
of
policemen
injuring
slightly
several
others
this
had
brought
to
the
fore
once
and
for
all
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
the
whole
problem
of
mass
against
class
and
had
given
it
such
an
airing
as
in
view
of
the
cheerful
optimistic
almost
inconsequential
american
mind
had
not
previously
been
possible
it
changed
quite
as
an
eruption
might
the
whole
face
of
the
commercial
landscape
man
thought
thereafter
somewhat
more
accurately
of
national
and
civic
things
what
was
anarchism
what
socialism
what
rights
had
the
rank
and
file
anyhow
in
economic
and
governmental
development
such
were
interesting
questions
and
following
the
bomb
which
acted
as
a
great
stone
cast
in
the
water
these
of
thought
were
still
widening
and
emanating
until
they
took
in
such
supposedly
remote
and
impregnable
quarters
as
editorial
offices
banks
and
financial
institutions
generally
and
the
haunts
of
political
dignitaries
and
their
jobs
in
the
face
of
this
however
cowperwood
was
not
disturbed
he
did
not
believe
in
either
the
strength
of
the
masses
or
their
ultimate
rights
though
he
sympathized
with
the
condition
of
individuals
and
did
believe
that
men
like
himself
were
sent
into
the
world
to
better
perfect
its
mechanism
and
habitable
order
often
now
in
these
preliminary
days
he
looked
at
the
large
companies
of
men
with
their
horses
gathered
in
and
about
the
several
carbarns
of
the
company
and
wondered
at
their
state
so
many
of
them
were
so
dull
they
were
rather
like
animals
patient
inartistic
hopeless
he
thought
of
their
shabby
homes
their
long
hours
their
poor
pay
and
then
concluded
that
if
anything
at
all
could
be
done
for
them
it
would
be
pay
them
decent
living
wages
which
he
proposed
to
do
nothing
more
they
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
his
dreams
or
his
visions
or
to
share
in
the
magnificence
and
social
dominance
which
he
craved
he
finally
decided
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
personally
visit
the
various
newspaper
publishers
and
talk
the
situation
over
with
them
addison
when
consulted
as
to
this
project
was
somewhat
dubious
he
had
small
faith
in
the
newspapers
he
had
seen
them
play
petty
politics
follow
up
enmities
and
personal
grudges
and
even
sell
out
in
certain
cases
for
pathetically
small
rewards
i
tell
you
how
it
is
frank
remarked
addison
on
one
occasion
you
will
have
to
do
all
this
business
on
cotton
heels
practically
you
know
that
old
gas
crowd
are
still
down
on
you
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
you
are
one
of
their
largest
stockholders
schryhart
is
at
all
friendly
and
he
practically
owns
the
chronicle
ricketts
will
just
about
say
what
he
wants
him
to
say
hyssop
of
the
mail
and
the
transcript
is
an
independent
man
but
he
a
presbyterian
and
a
cold
moralist

the
globe
practically
belongs
to
merrill
but
braxton
a
nice
fellow
at
that
old
general
macdonald
of
the
inquirer
is
old
general
macdonald
it
all
according
to
how
he
feels
when
he
gets
up
in
the
morning
if
he
should
chance
to
like
your
looks
he
might
support
you
forever
and
forever
until
you
crossed
his
conscience
in
some
way
he
a
fine
old
walrus
i
like
him
neither
schryhart
nor
merrill
nor
any
one
else
can
get
anything
out
of
him
unless
he
wants
to
give
it
he
may
not
live
so
many
years
however
and
i
do
trust
that
son
of
his
haguenin
of
the
press
is
all
right
and
friendly
to
you
as
i
understand
other
things
being
equal
i
think
he
naturally
support
you
in
anything
he
thought
was
fair
and
reasonable
well
there
you
have
them
get
them
all
on
your
side
if
you
can
do
ask
for
the
lasalle
street
tunnel
right
away
let
it
come
as
an
afterthought
a
great
public
need
the
main
thing
will
be
to
avoid
having
the
other
companies
stirring
up
a
real
fight
against
you
depend
on
it
schryhart
will
be
thinking
pretty
hard
about
this
whole
business
from
now
on
as
for
merrill
well
if
you
can
show
him
where
he
can
get
something
out
of
it
for
his
store
i
guess
he
be
for
you
it
is
one
of
the
splendid
yet
sinister
fascinations
of
life
that
there
is
no
tracing
to
their
ultimate
sources
all
the
winds
of
influence
that
play
upon
a
given
barque
all
the
breaths
of
chance
that
fill
or
desert
our
bellied
or
our
sagging
sails
we
plan
and
plan
but
who
by
taking
thought
can
add
a
cubit
to
his
stature
who
can
overcome
or
even
assist
the
providence
that
shapes
our
ends
rough

we
may
cowperwood
was
now
entering
upon
a
great
public
career
and
the
various
editors
and
public
personalities
of
the
city
were
watching
him
with
interest
augustus
haguenin
a
free
agent
with
his
organ
the
press
and
yet
not
free
either
because
he
was
harnessed
to
the
necessity
of
making
his
paper
pay
was
most
interested
lacking
the
commanding
magnetism
of
a
man
like
macdonald
he
was
nevertheless
an
honest
man
thoughtful
careful
haguenin
ever
since
the
outcome
of
cowperwood
gas
transaction
had
been
intensely
interested
in
the
latter
career
it
seemed
to
him
that
cowperwood
was
probably
destined
to
become
a
significant
figure
raw
glittering
force
however
compounded
of
the
cruel
machiavellianism
of
nature
if
it
be
but
machiavellian
seems
to
exercise
a
profound
attraction
for
the
conventionally
rooted
your
cautious
citizen
of
average
means
looking
out
through
the
eye
of
his
dull
world
of
seeming
fact
is
often
the
first
to
forgive
or
condone
the
grim
butcheries
of
theory
by
which
the
strong
rise
haguenin
observing
cowperwood
conceived
of
him
as
a
man
perhaps
as
much
sinned
against
as
sinning
a
man
who
would
be
faithful
to
friends
one
who
could
be
relied
upon
in
hours
of
great
stress
as
it
happened
the
haguenins
were
neighbors
of
the
cowperwoods
and
since
those
days
when
the
latter
had
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
enter
chicago
society
this
family
had
been
as
acceptable
as
any
of
those
who
had
remained
friendly
and
so
when
cowperwood
arrived
one
day
at
the
office
of
the
press
in
a
blowing
it
was
just
before
the
christmas
holidays
haguenin
was
glad
to
see
him
it
certainly
real
winter
weather
we
having
now
is
it
he
observed
cheerfully
how
goes
the
north
chicago
street
railway
business
for
months
he
with
the
other
publishers
had
been
aware
that
the
whole
north
side
was
to
be
made
over
by
fine
and
handsome
cars
and
there
already
was
talk
that
some
better
arrangement
was
to
be
made
to
bring
the
passengers
into
the
section
haguenin
said
cowperwood
smilingly
he
was
arrayed
in
a
heavy
fur
coat
with
a
collar
of
beaver
and
of
dogskin
we
have
reached
the
place
in
this
problem
on
the
north
side
where
we
are
going
to
require
the
assistance
of
the
newspapers
or
at
least
their
friendly
support
at
present
our
principal
difficulty
is
that
all
our
lines
when
they
come
stop
at
lake
street
just
this
side
of
the
bridges
that
means
a
long
walk
for
everybody
to
all
the
streets
south
of
it
and
as
you
probably
know
there
has
been
considerable
complaint
besides
that
this
river
traffic
is
becoming
more
and
more
what
i
may
say
it
has
been
for
years
an
intolerable
nuisance
we
have
all
suffered
from
it
no
effort
has
ever
been
made
to
regulate
it
and
because
it
is
so
heavy
i
doubt
whether
it
ever
can
be
systematized
in
any
satisfactory
way
the
best
thing
in
the
long
run
would
be
to
tunnel
under
the
river
but
that
is
such
an
expensive
proposition
that
as
things
are
now
we
are
in
no
position
to
undertake
it
the
traffic
on
the
north
side
does
not
warrant
it
it
really
does
not
warrant
the
reconstruction
of
the
three
bridges
which
we
now
use
at
state
dearborn
and
clark
yet
if
we
introduce
the
cable
system
which
we
now
propose
these
bridges
will
have
to
be
done
over
it
seems
to
me
seeing
that
this
is
an
enterprise
in
which
the
public
is
as
much
interested
almost
as
we
are
that
it
would
only
be
fair
if
the
city
should
help
pay
for
this
reconstruction
work
all
the
land
adjacent
to
these
lines
and
the
property
served
by
them
will
be
greatly
enhanced
in
value
the
city
taxing
power
will
rise
tremendously
i
have
talked
to
several
financiers
here
in
chicago
and
they
agree
with
me
but
as
is
usual
in
all
such
cases
i
find
that
some
of
the
politicians
are
against
me
since
i
have
taken
charge
of
the
north
chicago
company
the
attitude
of
one
or
two
papers
has
not
been
any
too
friendly
in
the
chronicle
controlled
by
schryhart
there
had
already
been
a
number
of
references
to
the
probability
that
now
since
cowperwood
and
his
friends
were
in
charge
the
tactics
of
the
old
lake
view
hyde
park
and
other
gas
organizations
would
be
repeated
braxton
globe
owned
by
merrill
being
had
merely
suggested
that
it
hoped
that
no
such
methods
would
be
repeated
here
perhaps
you
may
know
cowperwood
continued
that
we
have
a
very
sweeping
programme
of
improvement
in
mind
if
we
can
obtain
proper
public
consideration
and
assistance
at
this
point
he
reached
down
in
one
of
his
pockets
and
drew
forth
astutely
drafted
maps
and
especially
prepared
for
this
occasion
they
showed
main
cable
lines
on
north
clark
la
salle
and
wells
streets
these
lines
coming
converged
at
illinois
and
la
salle
streets
on
the
north
side
and
though
cowperwood
made
no
reference
to
it
at
the
moment
they
were
indicated
on
the
map
in
red
as
running
over
or
under
the
river
at
la
salle
street
where
was
no
bridge
and
emerging
therefrom
following
a
loop
along
la
salle
to
munroe
to
dearborn
to
randolph
and
thence
into
the
tunnel
again
cowperwood
allowed
haguenin
to
gather
the
very
interesting
traffic
significance
of
it
all
before
he
proceeded
on
the
map
haguenin
i
have
indicated
a
plan
which
if
we
can
gain
the
consent
of
the
city
will
obviate
any
quarrel
as
to
the
great
expense
of
reconstructing
the
bridges
and
will
make
use
of
a
piece
of
property
which
is
absolutely
without
value
to
the
city
at
present
but
which
can
be
made
into
something
of
vast
convenience
to
the
public
i
am
referring
as
you
see
he
laid
an
indicative
finger
on
the
map
in
haguenin
hands
to
the
old
la
salle
street
tunnel
which
is
now
boarded
up
and
absolutely
of
no
use
to
any
one
it
was
built
apparently
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
the
grade
the
average
loaded
wagon
could
negotiate
when
it
was
found
to
be
unprofitable
it
was
sold
to
the
city
and
locked
up
if
you
have
ever
been
through
it
you
know
what
condition
it
is
in
my
engineers
tell
me
the
walls
are
leaking
and
that
there
is
great
danger
of
a
unless
it
is
very
speedily
repaired
i
am
also
told
that
it
will
require
about
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
put
it
in
suitable
condition
for
use
my
theory
is
that
if
the
north
chicago
street
railway
is
willing
to
go
to
this
expense
for
the
sake
of
solving
this
problem
and
giving
the
residents
of
the
north
side
a
sensible
and
uninterrupted
service
into
the
business
heart
the
city
ought
to
be
willing
to
make
us
a
present
of
this
tunnel
for
the
time
being
or
at
least
a
long
lease
at
a
purely
nominal
rental
cowperwood
paused
to
see
what
haguenin
would
say
the
latter
was
looking
at
the
map
gravely
wondering
whether
it
was
fair
for
cowperwood
to
make
this
demand
wondering
whether
the
city
should
grant
it
to
him
without
compensation
wondering
whether
the
problem
was
as
serious
as
he
pointed
out
wondering
indeed
whether
this
whole
move
was
not
a
clever
ruse
to
obtain
something
for
nothing
and
what
is
this
he
asked
laying
a
finger
on
the
aforementioned
loop
that
replied
cowperwood
is
the
only
method
we
have
been
able
to
figure
out
of
serving
the
business
section
and
the
north
side
and
of
solving
this
bridge
problem
if
we
obtain
the
tunnel
as
i
hope
we
shall
all
the
cars
of
these
north
side
lines
will
emerge
here
he
pointed
to
la
salle
and
randolph
and
swing
around
that
is
they
will
if
the
city
council
give
us
the
right
of
way
i
think
of
course
there
can
be
no
reasonable
objection
to
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
citizens
of
the
north
side
should
have
as
comfortable
an
access
to
the
business
heart
as
those
of
the
west
or
south
side
none
in
the
world
haguenin
was
compelled
to
admit
are
you
satisfied
however
that
the
council
and
the
city
should
sanction
the
gift
of
a
loop
of
this
kind
without
some
form
of
compensation
i
see
no
reason
why
they
should
replied
cowperwood
in
a
somewhat
injured
tone
there
has
never
been
any
question
of
compensation
where
other
improvements
have
been
suggested
for
the
city
in
the
past
the
south
side
company
has
been
allowed
to
turn
in
a
loop
around
state
and
wabash
the
chicago
city
passenger
railway
has
a
loop
in
adams
and
washington
streets
quite
so
said
haguenin
vaguely
that
is
true
but
this
tunnel
now
do
you
think
that
should
fall
in
the
same
category
of
public
beneficences
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
help
thinking
as
he
looked
at
the
proposed
loop
indicated
on
the
map
that
the
new
cable
line
with
its
string
of
trailers
would
give
chicago
a
truly
metropolitan
air
and
would
provide
a
splendid
outlet
for
the
north
side
the
streets
in
question
were
magnificent
commercial
thoroughfares
crowded
even
at
this
date
with
structures
five
six
seven
and
even
eight
stories
high
and
brimming
with
heavy
streams
of
eager
life
young
fresh
optimistic
because
of
the
narrow
area
into
which
the
commercial
life
of
the
city
tended
to
congest
itself
this
property
and
these
streets
were
immensely
valuable
among
the
most
valuable
in
the
whole
city
also
he
observed
that
if
this
loop
did
come
here
its
cars
on
their
return
trip
along
dearborn
street
would
pass
by
his
very
door
the
office
of
the
press
thereby
enhancing
the
value
of
that
property
of
which
he
was
the
owner
i
certainly
do
haguenin
returned
cowperwood
emphatically
in
answer
to
his
query
personally
i
should
think
chicago
would
be
glad
to
pay
a
bonus
to
get
its
service
straightened
out
especially
where
a
corporation
comes
forward
with
a
liberal
conservative
programme
such
as
this
it
means
millions
in
growth
of
property
values
on
the
north
side
it
means
millions
to
the
business
heart
to
have
this
loop
system
laid
down
just
as
i
suggest
he
put
his
finger
firmly
on
the
map
which
he
had
brought
and
haguenin
agreed
with
him
that
the
plan
was
undoubtedly
a
sound
business
proposition
personally
i
should
be
the
last
to
complain
he
added
for
the
line
passes
my
door
at
the
same
time
this
tunnel
as
i
understand
it
cost
in
the
neighborhood
of
eight
hundred
thousand
or
a
million
dollars
it
is
a
delicate
problem
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
other
editors
think
of
it
and
how
the
city
council
itself
would
feel
toward
it
cowperwood
nodded
certainly
certainly
he
said
with
pleasure
i
would
not
come
here
at
all
if
i
did
not
feel
that
i
had
a
perfectly
legitimate
proposition
one
that
the
press
of
the
city
should
unite
in
supporting
where
a
corporation
such
as
ours
is
facing
large
expenditures
which
have
to
be
financed
by
outside
capital
it
is
only
natural
that
we
should
wish
to
allay
useless
groundless
opposition
in
advance
i
hope
we
may
command
your
support
i
hope
you
may
smiled
haguenin
they
parted
the
best
of
friends
the
other
publishers
guardians
of
the
city
privileges
were
not
quite
so
genial
as
haguenin
in
their
approval
of
proposition
the
use
of
a
tunnel
and
several
of
the
most
important
streets
might
readily
be
essential
to
the
development
of
cowperwood
north
side
schemes
but
the
gift
of
them
was
a
different
matter
already
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
various
publishers
and
editors
had
been
consulted
by
schryhart
merrill
and
others
with
a
view
to
discovering
how
they
felt
as
to
this
new
venture
and
whether
cowperwood
would
be
cheerfully
indorsed
or
not
schryhart
smarting
from
the
wounds
he
had
received
in
the
gas
war
viewed
this
new
activity
on
cowperwood
part
with
a
suspicious
and
envious
eye
to
him
much
more
than
to
the
others
it
spelled
a
new
and
dangerous
foe
in
the
field
although
all
the
leading
citizens
of
chicago
were
interested
i
suppose
now
he
said
one
evening
to
the
hon
walter
melville
hyssop
editor
and
publisher
of
the
transcript
and
the
evening
mail
whom
he
met
at
the
union
league
that
this
fellow
cowperwood
will
attempt
some
disturbing
coup
in
connection
with
affairs
he
is
just
the
sort
i
think
from
an
editorial
point
of
view
his
political
connections
will
bear
watching
already
there
were
rumors
abroad
that
mckenty
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
new
company
hyssop
a
ornate
conservative
person
was
not
so
sure
we
shall
find
out
soon
enough
no
doubt
what
propositions
cowperwood
has
in
hand
he
remarked
he
is
very
energetic
and
capable
as
i
understand
it
hyssop
and
schryhart
as
well
as
the
latter
and
merrill
had
been
social
friends
for
years
and
years
after
his
call
on
haguenin
cowperwood
naturally
selective
and
judgment
led
him
next
to
the
office
of
the
inquirer
old
general
macdonald
paper
where
he
found
that
because
of
rhuematism
and
the
severe
inclement
weather
of
chicago
the
old
general
had
sailed
only
a
few
days
before
for
italy
his
son
an
aggressive
mercantile
type
of
youth
of
and
a
managing
editor
by
the
name
of
du
bois
were
acting
in
his
stead
in
the
son
truman
leslie
macdonald
an
intense
calm
and
penetrating
young
man
cowperwood
encountered
some
one
who
like
himself
saw
life
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
sharp
personal
advantage
what
was
he
truman
leslie
macdonald
to
derive
from
any
given
situation
and
how
was
he
to
make
the
inquirer
an
even
greater
property
than
it
had
been
under
his
father
before
him
he
did
not
propose
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
old
general
rather
flowery
reputation
at
the
same
time
he
meant
to
become
imposingly
rich
an
active
member
of
a
young
and
very
smart
set
which
had
been
growing
up
on
the
north
side
he
rode
drove
was
instrumental
in
organizing
a
new
and
exclusive
country
club
and
despised
the
rank
and
file
as
unsuited
to
the
fine
atmosphere
to
which
he
aspired
clifford
du
bois
the
managing
editor
was
a
cool
reprobate
of
forty
masquerading
as
a
gentleman
and
using
the
inquirer
in
subtle
ways
for
furthering
his
personal
ends
and
that
under
the
old
general
very
nose
he
was
osseous
with
a
keen
formidable
nose
and
a
solid
chin
clifford
du
bois
was
always
careful
never
to
let
his
left
hand
know
what
his
right
hand
did
it
was
this
sapient
pair
that
received
cowperwood
in
the
old
absence
first
in
du
bois
room
and
then
in
that
of
macdonald
the
latter
had
already
heard
much
of
cowperwood
doings
men
who
had
been
connected
with
the
old
gas
war
jordan
jules
for
instance
president
of
the
old
north
chicago
gas
company
and
hudson
baker
president
of
the
old
west
chicago
gas
company
had
denounced
him
long
before
as
a
bucaneer
who
had
pirated
them
out
of
very
comfortable
sinecures
here
he
was
now
invading
the
north
chicago
field
and
coming
with
startling
schemes
for
the
reorganization
of
the
business
heart
why
should
the
city
have
something
in
return
or
better
yet
those
who
helped
to
formulate
the
public
opinion
so
influential
in
the
success
of
cowperwood
plans
truman
leslie
macdonald
as
has
been
said
did
not
see
life
from
his
point
of
view
at
all
he
had
in
mind
a
sharp
bargain
which
he
could
drive
with
cowperwood
during
the
old
gentleman
absence
the
general
need
never
know
i
understand
your
point
of
view
cowperwood
he
commented
loftily
but
where
does
the
city
come
in
i
see
very
clearly
how
important
this
is
to
the
people
of
the
north
side
and
even
to
the
merchants
and
owners
in
the
section
but
that
simply
means
that
it
is
ten
times
as
important
to
you
undoubtedly
it
will
help
the
city
but
the
city
is
growing
anyhow
and
that
will
help
you
i
said
all
along
that
these
public
franchises
were
worth
more
than
they
used
to
be
worth
nobody
seems
to
see
it
very
clearly
as
yet
but
it
true
just
the
same
that
tunnel
is
worth
more
now
than
the
day
it
was
built
even
if
the
city
ca
use
it
somebody
can
he
was
meaning
to
indicate
a
rival
car
line
cowperwood
bristled
internally
that
all
very
well
he
said
preserving
his
surface
composure
but
why
make
fish
of
one
and
flesh
of
another
the
south
side
company
has
a
loop
for
which
it
never
paid
a
dollar
so
has
the
chicago
city
passenger
railway
the
north
side
company
is
planning
more
extensive
improvements
than
were
ever
undertaken
by
any
single
company
before
i
hardly
think
it
is
fair
to
raise
the
question
of
compensation
and
a
franchise
tax
at
this
time
and
in
connection
with
this
one
company
only
um
well
that
may
be
true
of
the
other
companies
the
south
side
company
had
those
streets
long
ago
they
merely
connected
them
up
but
this
tunnel
now
that
a
different
matter
is
it
the
city
bought
and
paid
for
that
did
it
quite
true
to
help
out
men
who
saw
that
they
could
make
another
dollar
out
of
it
said
cowperwood
acidly
but
it
of
no
use
to
the
city
it
will
cave
in
pretty
soon
if
it
is
repaired
why
the
consent
of
alone
along
the
line
of
this
loop
is
going
to
aggregate
a
considerable
sum
it
seems
to
me
instead
of
hampering
a
great
work
of
this
kind
the
public
ought
to
do
everything
in
its
power
to
assist
it
it
means
giving
a
new
metropolitan
flavor
to
this
section
it
is
time
chicago
was
getting
out
of
its
swaddling
clothes
macdonald
the
younger
shook
his
head
he
saw
clearly
enough
the
significance
of
the
points
made
but
he
was
jealous
of
cowperwood
and
of
his
success
this
loop
franchise
and
tunnel
gift
meant
millions
for
some
one
why
should
there
be
something
in
it
for
him
he
called
in
du
bois
and
went
over
the
proposition
with
him
quite
without
effort
the
latter
sensed
the
drift
of
the
situation
it
an
excellent
proposition
he
said
i
do
see
but
that
the
city
should
have
something
though
public
sentiment
is
rather
against
gifts
to
corporations
just
at
present
cowperwood
caught
the
drift
of
what
was
in
young
macdonald
mind
well
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
fair
rate
of
compensation
to
the
city
he
asked
cautiously
wondering
whether
this
aggressive
youth
would
go
so
far
as
to
commit
himself
in
any
way
oh
well
as
to
that
macdonald
replied
with
a
deprecatory
wave
of
his
hand
i
could
say
it
ought
to
bear
a
reasonable
relationship
to
the
value
of
the
utility
as
it
now
stands
i
should
want
to
think
that
over
i
should
want
to
see
the
city
demand
anything
unreasonable
certainly
though
there
is
a
privilege
here
that
is
worth
something
cowperwood
flared
inwardly
his
greatest
weakness
if
he
had
one
was
that
he
could
but
ill
brook
opposition
of
any
kind
this
young
upstart
with
his
thin
cool
face
and
sharp
hard
eyes
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
him
and
his
paper
to
go
to
the
devil
he
went
away
hoping
that
he
could
influence
the
inquirer
in
some
other
way
upon
the
old
general
return
as
he
was
sitting
next
morning
in
his
office
in
north
clark
street
he
was
aroused
by
the
still
bell
of
the
telephone
one
of
the
earliest
in
use
on
the
wall
back
of
him
after
a
parley
with
his
secretary
he
was
informed
that
a
gentleman
connected
with
the
inquirer
wished
to
speak
with
him
this
is
the
inquirer
said
a
voice
which
cowperwood
his
ear
to
the
receiver
thought
he
recognized
as
that
of
young
truman
macdonald
the
general
son
you
wanted
to
know
continued
the
voice
what
would
be
considered
adequate
compensation
so
far
as
that
tunnel
matter
is
concerned
can
you
hear
me
yes
replied
cowperwood
well
i
should
not
care
to
influence
your
judgment
one
way
or
the
other
but
if
my
opinion
were
asked
i
should
say
about
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
north
chicago
street
railway
stock
would
be
satisfactory
the
voice
was
young
clear
steely
to
whom
would
you
suggest
that
it
might
be
paid
cowperwood
asked
softly
quite
genially
that
also
i
would
suggest
might
be
left
to
your
very
sound
judgment
the
voice
ceased
the
receiver
was
hung
up
well
i
be
damned
cowperwood
said
looking
at
the
floor
reflectively
a
smile
spread
over
his
face
i
not
going
to
be
held
up
like
that
i
do
need
to
be
it
is
worth
it
not
at
present
anyhow
his
teeth
set
he
was
underestimating
truman
leslie
macdonald
principally
because
he
did
not
like
him
he
thought
his
father
might
return
and
oust
him
it
was
one
of
the
most
vital
mistakes
he
ever
made
in
his
life
chapter
xxiv
the
coming
of
stephanie
platow
during
this
period
of
what
might
have
been
called
financial
and
commercial
progress
the
affairs
of
aileen
and
cowperwood
had
been
to
a
certain
extent
smoothed
over
each
summer
now
partly
to
take
mind
off
herself
and
partly
to
satisfy
his
own
desire
to
see
the
world
and
collect
objects
of
art
in
which
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
interested
it
was
cowperwood
custom
to
make
with
his
wife
a
short
trip
abroad
or
to
foreign
american
lands
visiting
in
these
two
years
russia
scandinavia
argentine
chili
and
mexico
their
plan
was
to
leave
in
may
or
june
with
the
outward
rush
of
traffic
and
return
in
september
or
early
october
his
idea
was
to
soothe
aileen
as
much
as
possible
to
fill
her
mind
with
pleasing
anticipations
as
to
her
eventual
social
triumph
somewhere
in
new
york
or
london
if
not
chicago
to
make
her
feel
that
in
spite
of
his
physical
desertion
he
was
still
spiritually
loyal
by
now
also
cowperwood
was
so
shrewd
that
he
had
the
ability
to
simulate
an
affection
and
practise
a
gallantry
which
he
did
not
feel
or
rather
that
was
not
backed
by
real
passion
he
was
the
soul
of
attention
he
would
buy
her
flowers
jewels
knickknacks
and
ornaments
he
would
see
that
her
comfort
was
looked
after
to
the
last
detail
and
yet
at
the
very
same
moment
perhaps
he
would
be
looking
cautiously
about
to
see
what
life
might
offer
in
the
way
of
illicit
entertainment
aileen
knew
this
although
she
could
not
prove
it
to
be
true
at
the
same
time
she
had
an
affection
and
an
admiration
for
the
man
which
gripped
her
in
spite
of
herself
you
have
perhaps
pictured
to
yourself
the
mood
of
some
general
who
has
perhaps
suffered
a
great
defeat
the
employee
who
after
years
of
faithful
service
finds
himself
discharged
what
shall
life
say
to
the
loving
when
their
love
is
no
longer
of
any
value
when
all
that
has
been
placed
upon
the
altar
of
affection
has
been
found
to
be
a
vain
sacrifice
philosophy
give
that
to
dolls
to
play
with
religion
seek
first
the
aileen
was
no
longer
the
lithe
forceful
dynamic
girl
of
when
cowperwood
first
met
her
she
was
still
beautiful
it
is
true
a
fair
matronly
creature
not
more
than
looking
perhaps
thirty
feeling
alas
that
she
was
a
girl
and
still
as
attractive
as
ever
it
is
a
grim
thing
to
a
woman
however
fortunately
placed
to
realize
that
age
is
creeping
on
and
that
love
that
singing
is
fading
into
the
ultimate
dark
aileen
within
the
hour
of
her
greatest
triumph
had
seen
love
die
it
was
useless
to
tell
herself
as
she
did
sometimes
that
it
might
come
back
revive
her
ultimately
realistic
temperament
told
her
this
could
never
be
though
she
had
routed
rita
sohlberg
she
was
fully
aware
that
cowperwood
original
constancy
was
gone
she
was
no
longer
happy
love
was
dead
that
sweet
illusion
with
its
pearly
pink
for
heart
and
borders
that
laughing
cherub
that
lures
with
cupid
mouth
and
misty
eye
that
young
tendril
of
the
vine
of
life
that
whispers
of
eternal
that
calls
and
calls
where
aching
wearied
feet
by
legion
follow
was
no
longer
in
existence
in
vain
the
tears
the
storms
the
in
vain
the
looks
in
the
mirror
the
studied
examination
of
plump
sweet
features
still
fresh
and
inviting
one
day
at
the
sight
of
tired
circles
under
her
eyes
she
ripped
from
her
neck
a
lovely
ruche
that
she
was
adjusting
and
throwing
herself
on
her
bed
cried
as
though
her
heart
would
break
why
primp
why
ornament
her
frank
did
not
love
her
what
to
her
now
was
a
handsome
residence
in
michigan
avenue
the
refinements
of
a
french
boudoir
or
clothing
that
ran
the
gamut
of
the
art
hats
that
were
like
orchids
blooming
in
serried
rows
in
vain
in
vain
like
the
raven
that
perched
above
the
lintel
of
the
door
sad
memory
was
here
grave
in
her
widow
weeds
crying
never
more
aileen
knew
that
the
sweet
illusion
which
had
bound
cowperwood
to
her
for
a
time
had
gone
and
would
never
come
again
he
was
here
his
step
was
in
the
room
mornings
and
evenings
at
night
for
long
prosaic
uninterrupted
periods
she
could
hear
him
breathing
by
her
side
his
hand
on
her
body
there
were
other
nights
when
he
was
not
there
when
he
was
out
of
the
city
and
she
resigned
herself
to
accept
his
excuses
at
their
face
value
why
quarrel
she
asked
herself
what
could
she
do
she
was
waiting
waiting
but
for
what
and
cowperwood
noting
the
strange
unalterable
changes
which
time
works
in
us
all
the
inward
lap
of
the
marks
of
age
the
fluted
recession
of
that
splendor
and
radiance
which
is
youth
sighed
at
times
perhaps
but
turned
his
face
to
that
dawn
which
is
forever
breaking
where
youth
is
not
for
him
that
poetic
loyalty
which
substitutes
for
the
perfection
of
young
love
its
memories
or
takes
for
the
glitter
of
passion
and
desire
that
once
was
the
happy
thoughts
of
companionship
the
crystal
memories
that
like
early
dews
congealed
remain
beaded
recollections
to
comfort
or
torture
for
the
end
of
former
joys
on
the
contrary
after
the
vanishing
of
rita
sohlberg
with
all
that
she
meant
in
the
way
of
a
delicate
insouciance
which
aileen
had
never
known
his
temperament
ached
for
he
must
have
something
like
that
truth
to
say
he
must
always
have
youth
the
illusion
of
beauty
vanity
in
womanhood
the
novelty
of
a
new
untested
temperament
quite
as
he
must
have
pictures
old
porcelain
music
a
mansion
illuminated
missals
power
the
applause
of
the
great
unthinking
world
as
has
been
said
this
promiscuous
attitude
on
cowperwood
part
was
the
natural
flowering
out
of
a
temperament
that
was
chronically
promiscuous
intellectually
uncertain
and
philosophically
anarchistic
from
one
point
of
view
it
might
have
been
said
of
him
that
he
was
seeking
the
realization
of
an
ideal
yet
to
one
amazement
our
very
ideals
change
at
times
and
leave
us
floundering
in
the
dark
what
is
an
ideal
anyhow
a
wraith
a
mist
a
perfume
in
the
wind
a
dream
of
fair
water
the
of
a
girl
like
antoinette
nowak
was
a
little
too
strained
for
him
it
was
too
ardent
too
clinging
and
he
had
gradually
extricated
himself
not
without
difficulty
from
that
particular
entanglement
since
then
he
had
been
intimate
with
other
women
for
brief
periods
but
to
no
great
satisfaction

a
a

for

coming

it
was
a
pathetic
mess
at
times

so
are
all
defiant
variations
from
the
accustomed
drift
of

in
the
hardy
language
of

one
can
not

omelette
without
cracking
a
number
of
eggs
the
coming
of
stephanie
platow
russian
jewess
on
one
side
of
her
family
southwestern
american
on
the
other
was
an
event
in
cowperwood
life
she
was
tall
graceful
brilliant
young
with
much
of
the
optimism
of
rita
sohlberg
and
yet
endowed
with
a
strange
fatalism
which
once
he
knew
her
better
touched
and
moved
him
he
met
her
on
shipboard
on
the
way
to
goteborg
her
father
isadore
platow
was
a
wealthy
furrier
of
chicago
he
was
a
large
meaty
oily
type
of
man
a
kind
of
ambling
gelatinous
formula
of
the
male
with
the
usual
sound
commercial
instincts
of
the
jew
but
with
an
errant
philosophy
which
led
him
to
believe
first
one
thing
and
then
another
so
long
as
neither
interfered
definitely
with
his
business
he
was
an
admirer
of
henry
george
and
of
so
altruistic
a
programme
as
that
of
robert
owen
and
also
in
his
way
a
social
snob
and
yet
he
had
married
susetta
osborn
a
texas
girl
who
was
once
his
bookkeeper
platow
was
lithe
amiable
subtle
with
an
eye
always
to
the
main
social
chance
in
other
words
a
climber
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
realize
that
a
knowledge
of
books
and
art
and
current
events
was
essential
and
so
she
went
in
for
these
things
it
is
curious
how
the
temperaments
of
parents
blend
and
revivify
in
their
children
as
stephanie
grew
up
she
had
repeated
in
her
very
differing
body
some
of
her
father
and
mother
characteristics
an
interesting
variability
of
soul
she
was
tall
dark
sallow
lithe
with
a
strange
moodiness
of
heart
and
a
recessive
fulgurous
gleam
in
her
almost
eyes
she
had
a
full
sensuous
cupid
mouth
a
dreamy
and
even
languishing
expression
a
graceful
neck
and
a
heavy
dark
and
yet
pleasingly
modeled
face
from
both
her
father
and
mother
she
had
inherited
a
penchant
for
art
literature
philosophy
and
music
already
at
eighteen
she
was
dreaming
of
painting
singing
writing
poetry
writing
books
acting
anything
and
everything
serene
in
her
own
judgment
of
what
was
worth
while
she
was
like
to
lay
stress
on
any
silly
mood
or
fad
thinking
it
exquisite
the
last
word
finally
she
was
a
rank
voluptuary
dreaming
dreams
of
passionate
union
with
first
one
and
then
another
type
of
artist
poet
musician
the
whole
gamut
of
the
artistic
and
emotional
world
cowperwood
first
saw
her
on
board
the
centurion
one
june
morning
as
the
ship
lay
at
dock
in
new
york
he
and
aileen
were
en
route
for
norway
she
and
her
father
and
mother
for
denmark
and
switzerland
she
was
hanging
over
the
starboard
rail
looking
at
a
flock
of
gulls
which
were
besieging
the
port
of
the
cook
galley
she
was
musing
soulfully
conscious
fully
that
she
was
musing
soulfully
he
paid
very
little
attention
to
her
except
to
note
that
she
was
tall
rhythmic
and
that
a
plaid
dress
and
an
immense
veil
of
gray
silk
wound
about
her
shoulders
and
waist
and
over
one
arm
after
the
manner
of
a
hindu
shawl
appeared
to
become
her
much
her
face
seemed
very
sallow
and
her
eyes
ringed
as
if
indicating
dyspepsia
her
black
hair
under
a
chic
hat
did
not
escape
his
critical
eye
later
she
and
her
father
appeared
at
the
captain
table
to
which
the
cowperwoods
had
also
been
invited
cowperwood
and
aileen
did
not
know
how
to
take
this
girl
though
she
interested
them
both
they
little
suspected
the
chameleon
character
of
her
soul
she
was
an
artist
and
as
formless
and
unstable
as
water
it
was
a
mere
passing
gloom
that
possessed
her
cowperwood
liked
the
cast
of
her
face
a
certain
fullness
of
the
neck
her
dark
sleepy
eyes
but
she
was
much
too
young
and
nebulous
he
thought
and
he
let
her
pass
on
this
trip
which
endured
for
ten
days
he
saw
much
of
her
in
different
moods
walking
with
a
young
jew
in
whom
she
seemed
greatly
interested
playing
at
shuffleboard
reading
solemnly
in
a
corner
out
of
the
reach
of
the
wind
or
spray
and
usually
looking
naive
preternaturally
innocent
remote
dreamy
at
other
times
she
seemed
possessed
of
a
wild
animation
her
eyes
alight
her
expression
vigorous
an
intense
glow
in
her
soul
once
he
saw
her
bent
over
a
small
wood
block
cutting
a
with
a
thin
steel
graving
tool
because
of
stephanie
youth
and
seeming
unimportance
her
lack
of
what
might
be
called
compelling
rosy
charm
aileen
had
become
reasonably
friendly
with
the
girl
far
subtler
even
at
her
years
than
aileen
stephanie
gathered
a
very
good
impression
of
the
former
of
her
mental
girth
and
how
to
take
her
she
made
friends
with
her
made
a
for
her
made
a
sketch
of
her
she
confided
to
aileen
that
in
her
own
mind
she
was
destined
for
the
stage
if
her
parents
would
permit
and
aileen
invited
her
to
see
her
husband
pictures
on
their
return
she
little
knew
how
much
of
a
part
stephanie
would
play
in
cowperwood
life
the
cowperwoods
having
been
put
down
at
goteborg
saw
no
more
of
the
platows
until
late
october
then
aileen
being
lonely
called
to
see
stephanie
and
occasionally
thereafter
stephanie
came
over
to
the
south
side
to
see
the
cowperwoods
she
liked
to
roam
about
their
house
to
dream
meditatively
in
some
nook
of
the
rich
interior
with
a
book
for
company
she
liked
cowperwood
pictures
his
jades
his
missals
his
ancient
radiant
glass
from
talking
with
aileen
she
realized
that
the
latter
had
no
real
love
for
these
things
that
her
expressions
of
interest
and
pleasure
were
pure
based
on
their
value
as
possessions
for
stephanie
herself
certain
of
the
illuminated
books
and
bits
of
glass
had
a
heavy
sensuous
appeal
which
only
the
truly
artistic
can
understand
they
unlocked
dark
dream
moods
and
pageants
for
her
she
responded
to
them
lingered
over
them
experienced
strange
moods
from
them
as
from
the
orchestrated
richness
of
music
and
in
doing
so
she
thought
of
cowperwood
often
did
he
really
like
these
things
or
was
he
just
buying
them
to
be
buying
them
she
had
heard
much
of
the
pseudo
artistic
the
people
who
made
a
show
of
art
she
recalled
cowperwood
as
he
walked
the
deck
of
the
centurion
she
remembered
his
large
comprehensive
embracing
eyes
that
seemed
to
blaze
with
intelligence
he
seemed
to
her
quite
obviously
a
more
forceful
and
significant
man
than
her
father
and
yet
she
could
not
have
said
why
he
always
seemed
so
trigly
dressed
so
well
put
together
there
was
a
friendly
warmth
about
all
that
he
said
or
did
though
he
said
or
did
little
she
felt
that
his
eyes
were
mocking
that
back
in
his
soul
there
was
some
kind
of
humor
over
something
which
she
did
not
understand
quite
after
stephanie
had
been
back
in
chicago
six
months
during
which
time
she
saw
very
little
of
cowperwood
who
was
busy
with
his
programme
she
was
swept
into
the
net
of
another
interest
which
carried
her
away
from
him
and
aileen
for
the
time
being
on
the
west
side
among
a
circle
of
her
mother
friends
had
been
organized
an
amateur
dramatic
league
with
no
less
object
than
to
elevate
the
stage
that
problem
never
fails
to
interest
the
new
and
the
inexperienced
it
all
began
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
new
rich
of
the
west
side
the
timberlakes
they
in
their
large
house
on
ashland
avenue
had
a
stage
and
georgia
timberlake
a
girl
of
twenty
with
flaxen
hair
imagined
she
could
act
timberlake
a
fat
indulgent
mother
rather
agreed
with
her
the
whole
idea
after
a
few
discursive
performances
of
milton
the
masque
of
comus
pyramus
and
thisbe
and
an
improved
harlequin
and
columbine
written
by
one
of
the
members
was
transferred
to
the
realm
of
the
studios
then
quartered
in
the
new
arts
building
an
artist
by
the
name
of
lane
cross
a
who
was
much
less
of
an
artist
than
he
was
a
stage
director
and
not
much
of
either
but
who
made
his
living
by
hornswaggling
society
into
the
belief
that
he
could
paint
was
induced
to
take
charge
of
these
stage
performances
by
degrees
the
garrick
players
as
they
chose
to
call
themselves
developed
no
little
skill
and
craftsmanship
in
presenting
one
form
and
another
of
classic
and
play
romeo
and
juliet
with
few
properties
of
any
kind
the
learned
ladies
of
moliere
the
rivals
and
the
elektra
of
sophocles
were
all
given
considerable
ability
of
one
kind
and
another
was
developed
the
group
including
two
actresses
of
subsequent
repute
on
the
american
stage
one
of
whom
was
stephanie
platow
there
were
some
ten
girls
and
women
among
the
active
members
and
almost
as
many
men
a
variety
of
characters
much
too
extended
to
discuss
here
there
was
a
dramatic
critic
by
the
name
of
gardner
knowles
a
young
man
very
smug
and
handsome
who
was
connected
with
the
chicago
press
whipping
his
neatly
trousered
legs
with
his
bright
little
cane
he
used
to
appear
at
the
rooms
of
the
players
at
the
tuesday
thursday
and
saturday
teas
which
they
inaugurated
and
discuss
the
merits
of
the
venture
thus
the
garrick
players
were
gradually
introduced
into
the
newspapers
lane
cross
the
artist
who
had
charge
was
a
rake
at
heart
a
subtle
seducer
of
women
who
however
escaped
detection
by
a
smooth
conventional
bearing
he
was
interested
in
such
girls
as
georgia
timberlake
irma
ottley
a
rosy
aggressive
maiden
who
essayed
comic
roles
and
stephanie
platow
these
with
another
girl
ethel
tuckerman
very
emotional
and
romantic
who
could
dance
charmingly
and
sing
made
up
a
group
of
friends
which
became
very
close
presently
intimacies
sprang
up
only
in
this
realm
instead
of
ending
in
marriage
they
merely
resulted
in
sex
liberty
thus
ethel
tuckerman
became
the
mistress
of
lane
cross
an
illicit
attachment
grew
up
between
irma
ottley
and
a
young
society
idler
by
the
name
of
bliss
bridge
and
gardner
knowles
ardently
admiring
stephanie
platow
literally
seized
upon
her
one
afternoon
in
her
own
home
when
he
went
ostensibly
to
interview
her
and
overpersuaded
her
she
was
only
reasonably
fond
of
him
not
in
love
but
being
generous
nebulous
passionate
emotional
inexperienced
voiceless
and
vainly
curious
without
any
sense
of
the
meums
and
teums
that
govern
society
in
such
matters
she
allowed
this
rather
brutal
thing
to
happen
she
was
not
a
coward
was
too
nebulous
and
yet
forceful
to
be
such
her
parents
never
knew
and
once
so
launched
another
world
that
of
sex
satisfaction
began
to
dawn
on
her
were
these
young
people
evil
let
the
social
philosopher
answer
one
thing
is
certain
they
did
not
establish
homes
and
raise
children
on
the
contrary
they
led
a
gay
butterfly
existence
for
nearly
two
years
then
came
a
gift
in
the
lute
quarrels
developed
over
parts
respective
degrees
of

and
leadership
ethel
tuckerman
fell
out
with
lane
cross
because
she
discovered
him
making
love
to
irma
ottley
irma
and
bliss
bridge
released
each
other
the
latter
transferring
his
affections
to
georgia
timberlake
stephanie
platow
by
far
the
most
individual
of
them
all
developed
a
strange
inconsequence
as
to
her
deeds
it
was
when
she
was
drawing
near
the
age
of
twenty
that
the
affair
with
gardner
knowles
began
after
a
time
lane
cross
with
his
somewhat
earnest
attempt
at
artistic
interpretation
and
his
superiority
in
the
matter
of
years
he
was
forty
and
young
knowles
only
seemed
more
interesting
to
stephanie
and
he
was
quick
to
respond
there
followed
an
idle
passionate
union
with
this
man
which
seemed
important
but
was
not
so
at
all
and
then
it
was
that
stephanie
began
dimly
to
perceive
that
it
was
on
and
on
that
the
blessings
lie
that
somewhere
there
might
be
some
man
much
more
remarkable
than
either
of
these
but
this
was
only
a
dream
she
thought
of
cowperwood
at
times
but
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
too
wrapped
up
in
grim
tremendous
things
far
apart
from
this
romantic
world
of
amateur
dramatics
in
which
she
was
involved
chapter
xxv
airs
from
the
orient
cowperwood
gained
his
first
real
impression
of
stephanie
at
the
garrick
players
where
he
went
with
aileen
once
to
witness
a
performance
of
elektra
he
liked
stephanie
particularly
in
this
part
and
thought
her
beautiful
one
evening
not
long
afterward
he
noticed
her
in
his
own
home
looking
at
his
jades
particularly
a
row
of
bracelets
and
he
liked
the
rhythmic
outline
of
her
body
which
reminded
him
of
a
letter
s
in
motion
quite
suddenly
it
came
over
him
that
she
was
a
remarkable
girl
very
destined
perhaps
to
some
significant
future
at
the
same
time
stephanie
was
thinking
of
him
do
you
find
them
interesting
he
asked
stopping
beside
her
i
think
they
wonderful
those
and
that
pale
fatty
white
i
can
see
how
beautiful
they
would
be
in
a
chinese
setting
i
have
always
wished
we
could
find
a
chinese
or
japanese
play
to
produce
sometime
yes
with
your
black
hair
those
would
look
well
said
cowperwood
he
had
never
deigned
to
comment
on
a
feature
of
hers
before
she
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
him
velvety
eyes
with
a
kind
of
black
glow
in
them
and
now
he
noticed
how
truly
fine
they
were
and
how
nice
were
her
hands
brown
almost
as
a
malay
he
said
nothing
more
but
the
next
day
an
unlabeled
box
was
delivered
to
stephanie
at
her
home
containing
a
pair
of
jade
a
bracelet
and
a
brooch
with
chinese
characters
intagliated
stephanie
was
beside
herself
with
delight
she
gathered
them
up
in
her
hands
and
kissed
them
fastening
the
in
her
ears
and
adjusting
the
bracelet
and
ring
despite
her
experience
with
her
friends
and
relatives
her
stage
associates
and
her
paramours
she
was
still
a
little
unschooled
in
the
world
her
heart
was
essentially
poetic
and
innocent
no
one
had
ever
given
her
much
of
anything
not
even
her
parents
her
allowance
thus
far
in
life
had
been
a
pitiful
six
dollars
a
week
outside
of
her
clothing
as
she
surveyed
these
pretty
things
in
the
privacy
of
her
room
she
wondered
oddly
whether
cowperwood
was
growing
to
like
her
would
such
a
strong
hard
business
man
be
interested
in
her
she
had
heard
her
father
say
he
was
becoming
very
rich
was
she
a
great
actress
as
some
said
she
was
and
would
strong
able
types
of
men
like
cowperwood
take
to
her
eventually
she
had
heard
of
rachel
of
nell
gwynne
of
the
divine
sarah
and
her
loves
she
took
the
precious
gifts
and
locked
them
in
a
box
which
was
sacred
to
her
trinkets
and
her
secrets
the
mere
acceptance
of
these
things
in
silence
was
sufficient
indication
to
cowperwood
that
she
was
of
a
friendly
turn
of
mind
he
waited
patiently
until
one
day
a
letter
came
to
his
office
not
his
house
addressed
frank
algernon
cowperwood
personal
it
was
written
in
a
small
neat
careful
hand
almost
printed
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
your
wonderful
present
i
mean
you
should
give
them
to
me
and
i
know
you
sent
them
i
shall
keep
them
with
pleasure
and
wear
them
with
delight
it
was
so
nice
of
you
to
do
this
stephanie
platow
cowperwood
studied
the
handwriting
the
paper
the
phraseology
for
a
girl
of
only
a
little
over
twenty
this
was
wise
and
reserved
and
tactful
she
might
have
written
to
him
at
his
residence
he
gave
her
the
benefit
of
a
week
time
and
then
found
her
in
his
own
home
one
sunday
afternoon
aileen
had
gone
calling
and
stephanie
was
pretending
to
await
her
return
it
nice
to
see
you
there
in
that
window
he
said
you
fit
your
background
perfectly
do
i
the
eyes
burned
soulfully
the
panneling
back
of
her
was
of
dark
oak
burnished
by
the
rays
of
an
afternoon
winter
sun
stephanie
platow
had
dressed
for
this
opportunity
her
full
rich
short
black
hair
was
caught
by
a
childish
band
of
ribbon
holding
it
low
over
her
temples
and
ears
her
lithe
body
so
harmonious
in
its
graven
roundness
was
clad
in
an
bodice
and
a
black
skirt
with
gussets
of
red
about
the
hem
her
smooth
arms
from
the
elbows
down
were
bare
on
one
wrist
was
the
jade
bracelet
he
had
given
her
her
stockings
were
silk
and
despite
the
chill
of
the
day
her
feet
were
shod
in
enticingly
low
slippers
with
brass
buckles
cowperwood
retired
to
the
hall
to
hang
up
his
overcoat
and
came
back
smiling
is
cowperwood
about
the
butler
says
she
out
calling
but
i
thought
i
wait
a
little
while
anyhow
she
may
come
back
she
turned
up
a
dark
smiling
face
to
him
with
languishing
inscrutable
eyes
and
he
recognized
the
artist
at
last
full
and
clear
i
see
you
like
my
bracelet
do
you
it
beautiful
she
replied
looking
down
and
surveying
it
dreamily
i
do
always
wear
it
i
carry
it
in
my
muff
i
just
put
it
on
for
a
little
while
i
carry
them
all
with
me
always
i
love
them
so
i
like
to
feel
them
she
opened
a
small
chamois
bag
beside
her
lying
with
her
handkerchief
and
a
which
she
always
carried
and
took
out
the
and
brooch
cowperwood
glowed
with
a
strange
feeling
of
approval
and
enthusiasm
at
this
manifestation
of
real
interest
he
liked
jade
himself
very
much
but
more
than
that
the
feeling
that
prompted
this
expression
in
another
roughly
speaking
it
might
have
been
said
of
him
that
youth
and
hope
in
women
particularly
youth
when
combined
with
beauty
and
ambition
in
a
girl
touched
him
he
responded
keenly
to
her
impulse
to
do
or
be
something
in
this
world
whatever
it
might
be
and
he
looked
on
the
smart
egoistic
vanity
of
so
many
with
a
kindly
tolerant
almost
parental
eye
poor
little
organisms
growing
on
the
tree
of
life
they
would
burn
out
and
fade
soon
enough
he
did
not
know
the
ballad
of
the
roses
of
yesteryear
but
if
he
had
it
would
have
appealed
to
him
he
did
not
care
to
rifle
them
but
should
their
temperaments
or
tastes
incline
them
in
his
direction
they
would
not
suffer
vastly
in
their
lives
because
of
him
the
fact
was
the
man
was
essentially
generous
where
women
were
concerned
how
nice
of
you
he
commented
smiling
i
like
that
and
then
seeing
a
and
pencil
beside
her
he
asked
what
are
you
doing
just
sketching
let
me
see
it
nothing
much
she
replied
deprecatingly
i
do
draw
very
well
gifted
girl
he
replied
picking
it
up
paints
draws
carves
on
wood
plays
sings
acts
all
rather
badly
she
sighed
turning
her
head
languidly
and
looking
away
in
her
she
had
put
all
of
her
best
drawings
there
were
sketches
of
nude
women
dancers
torsos
bits
of
running
figures
sad
heavy
sensuous
heads
and
necks
of
sleeping
girls
chins
up
eyelids
down
studies
of
her
brothers
and
sister
and
of
her
father
and
mother
delightful
exclaimed
cowperwood
keenly
alive
to
a
new
treasure
good
heavens
where
had
been
his
eyes
all
this
while
here
was
a
jewel
lying
at
his
doorstep
innocent
untarnished
a
real
jewel
these
drawings
suggested
a
fire
of
perception
smoldering
and
somber
which
thrilled
him
these
are
beautiful
to
me
stephanie
he
said
simply
a
strange
uncertain
feeling
of
real
affection
creeping
over
him
the
greatest
love
was
for
art
it
was
hypnotic
to
him
did
you
ever
study
art
he
asked
no
and
you
never
studied
acting
no
she
shook
her
head
in
a
slow
sad
enticing
way
the
black
hair
concealing
her
ears
moved
him
strangely
i
know
the
art
of
your
stage
work
is
real
and
you
have
a
natural
art
which
i
just
seem
to
see
what
has
been
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
oh
no
she
sighed
it
seems
to
me
that
i
merely
play
at
everything
i
could
cry
sometimes
when
i
think
how
i
go
on
at
twenty
that
is
old
enough
she
smiled
archly
stephanie
he
asked
cautiously
how
old
are
you
exactly
i
will
be
in
april
she
answered
have
your
parents
been
very
strict
with
you
she
shook
her
head
dreamily
no
what
makes
you
ask
they
paid
very
much
attention
to
me
they
always
liked
lucille
and
gilbert
and
ormond
best
her
voice
had
a
plaintive
neglected
ring
it
was
the
voice
she
used
in
her
best
scenes
on
the
stage
do
they
realize
that
you
are
very
talented
i
think
perhaps
my
mother
feels
that
i
may
have
some
ability
my
father
does
i
sure
why
she
lifted
those
languorous
plaintive
eyes
why
stephanie
if
you
want
to
know
i
think
you
wonderful
i
thought
so
the
other
night
when
you
were
looking
at
those
jades
it
all
came
over
me
you
are
an
artist
truly
and
i
have
been
so
busy
i
have
scarcely
seen
it
tell
me
one
thing
yes
she
drew
in
a
soft
breath
filling
her
chest
and
expanding
her
bosom
while
she
looked
at
him
from
under
her
black
hair
her
hands
were
crossed
idly
in
her
lap
then
she
looked
demurely
down
look
stephanie
look
up
i
want
to
ask
you
something
you
have
known
something
of
me
for
over
a
year
do
you
like
me
i
think
you
very
wonderful
she
murmured
is
that
all
is
that
much
she
smiled
shooting
a
dull
look
in
his
direction
you
wore
my
bracelet
were
you
very
glad
to
get
it
oh
yes
she
sighed
with
aspirated
breath
pretending
a
kind
of
suffocation
how
beautiful
you
really
are
he
said
rising
and
looking
down
at
her
she
shook
her
head
no
yes
no
come
stephanie
stand
by
me
and
look
at
me
you
are
so
tall
and
slender
and
graceful
you
are
like
something
out
of
asia
she
sighed
turning
in
a
sinuous
way
as
he
slipped
his
arm
her
i
do
think
we
should
should
we
she
asked
naively
after
a
moment
pulling
away
from
him
stephanie
i
think
i
better
go
now
please
chapter
xxvi
love
and
war
it
was
during
the
earlier
phases
of
his
connection
with
chicago
that
cowperwood
ardently
interesting
himself
in
stephanie
platow
developed
as
serious
a
sex
affair
as
any
that
had
yet
held
him
at
once
after
a
few
secret
interviews
with
her
he
adopted
his
favorite
ruse
in
such
matters
and
established
bachelor
quarters
in
the
section
as
a
convenient
several
conversations
with
stephanie
were
not
quite
as
illuminating
as
they
might
have
been
for
wonderful
as
she
was
a
kind
of
artistic
godsend
in
this
dull
western
atmosphere
she
was
also
enigmatic
and
elusive
very
he
learned
speedily
in
talking
with
her
on
several
days
when
they
met
for
lunch
of
her
dramatic
ambitions
and
of
the
seeming
spiritual
and
artistic
support
she
required
from
some
one
who
would
have
faith
in
her
and
inspire
her
by
his
or
her
confidence
he
learned
all
about
the
garrick
players
her
home
intimacies
and
friends
the
growing
quarrels
in
the
dramatic
organization
he
asked
her
as
they
sat
in
a
favorite
and
inconspicuous
resort
of
his
finding
during
one
of
those
moments
when
blood
and
not
intellect
was
ruling
between
them
whether
she
had
ever
once
she
naively
admitted
it
was
a
great
shock
to
cowperwood
he
had
fancied
her
refreshingly
innocent
but
she
explained
it
was
all
so
accidental
so
unintentional
on
her
part
very
she
described
it
all
so
gravely
soulfully
pathetically
with
such
a
brooding
contemplative
backward
searching
of
the
mind
that
he
was
astonished
and
in
a
way
touched
what
a
pity
it
was
gardner
knowles
who
had
done
this
she
admitted
but
he
was
not
very
much
to
blame
either
it
just
happened
she
had
tried
to
protest
but
was
she
angry
yes
but
then
she
was
sorry
to
do
anything
to
hurt
gardner
knowles
he
was
such
a
charming
boy
and
he
had
such
a
lovely
mother
and
sister
and
the
like
cowperwood
was
astonished
he
had
reached
that
point
in
life
where
the
absence
of
primal
innocence
in
a
woman
was
not
very
significant
but
in
stephanie
seeing
that
she
was
so
utterly
charming
it
was
almost
too
bad
he
thought
what
fools
the
platows
must
be
to
tolerate
this
art
atmosphere
for
stephanie
without
keeping
a
sharp
watch
over
it
nevertheless
he
was
inclined
to
believe
from
observation
thus
far
that
stephanie
might
be
hard
to
watch
she
was
ingrainedly
irresponsible
apparently
so
artistically
nebulous
so
to
go
on
and
be
friends
with
this
scamp
and
yet
she
protested
that
never
after
that
had
there
been
the
least
thing
between
them
cowperwood
could
scarcely
believe
it
she
must
be
lying
and
yet
he
liked
her
so
the
very
romantic
inconsequential
way
in
which
she
narrated
all
this
staggered
amused
and
even
fascinated
him
but
stephanie
he
argued
curiously
there
must
been
some
aftermath
to
all
this
what
happened
what
did
you
do
nothing
she
shook
her
head
he
had
to
smile
but
oh
do
let
talk
about
it
she
pleaded
i
do
want
to
it
hurts
me
there
was
nothing
more
she
sighed
and
cowperwood
meditated
the
evil
was
now
done
and
the
best
that
he
could
do
if
he
cared
for
her
at
all
and
he
did
was
to
overlook
it
he
surveyed
her
oddly
wonderingly
what
a
charming
soul
she
was
anyhow
how
naive
how
brooding
she
had
art
lots
of
it
did
he
want
to
give
her
up
as
he
might
have
known
it
was
dangerous
to
trifle
with
a
type
of
this
kind
particularly
once
awakened
to
the
significance
of
promiscuity
and
unless
mastered
by
some
absorbing
passion
stephanie
had
had
too
much
flattery
and
affection
heaped
upon
her
in
the
past
two
years
to
be
easily
absorbed
nevertheless
for
the
time
being
anyhow
she
was
fascinated
by
the
significance
of
cowperwood
it
was
wonderful
to
have
so
fine
so
powerful
a
man
care
for
her
she
conceived
of
him
as
a
very
great
artist
in
his
realm
rather
than
as
a
business
man
and
he
grasped
this
fact
after
a
very
little
while
and
appreciated
it
to
his
delight
she
was
even
more
beautiful
physically
than
he
had
anticipated
a
smoldering
passionate
girl
who
met
him
with
a
fire
which
though
somber
quite
rivaled
his
own
she
was
different
too
in
her
languorous
acceptance
of
all
that
he
bestowed
from
any
one
he
had
ever
known
she
was
as
tactful
as
rita
sohlberg
more
so
but
so
preternaturally
silent
at
times
stephanie
he
would
exclaim
do
talk
what
are
you
thinking
of
you
dream
like
an
african
native
she
merely
sat
and
smiled
in
a
dark
way
or
sketched
or
modeled
him
she
was
constantly
penciling
something
until
moved
by
the
fever
of
her
blood
when
she
would
sit
and
look
at
him
or
brood
silently
eyes
down
then
when
he
would
reach
for
her
with
seeking
hands
she
would
sigh
oh
yes
oh
yes
those
were
delightful
days
with
stephanie
in
the
matter
of
young
macdonald
request
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
securities
as
well
as
the
attitude
of
the
other
editors
hyssop
braxton
ricketts
and
so
on
who
had
proved
subtly
critical
cowperwood
conferred
with
addison
and
mckenty
a
likely
lad
that
commented
mckenty
succintly
when
he
heard
it
he
do
better
than
his
father
in
one
way
anyhow
he
probably
make
more
money
mckenty
had
seen
old
general
macdonald
just
once
in
his
life
and
liked
him
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
general
would
think
of
that
if
he
knew
commented
addison
who
admired
the
old
editor
greatly
afraid
he
would
sleep
very
well
there
is
just
one
thing
observed
cowperwood
thoughtfully
this
young
man
will
certainly
come
into
control
of
the
inquirer
sometime
he
looks
to
me
like
some
one
who
would
not
readily
forget
an
injury
he
smiled
sardonically
so
did
mckenty
and
addison
be
that
as
it
may
suggested
the
latter
he
is
editor
yet
mckenty
who
never
revealed
his
true
views
to
any
one
but
cowperwood
waited
until
he
had
the
latter
alone
to
observe
what
can
they
do
your
request
is
a
reasonable
one
why
should
the
city
give
you
the
tunnel
it
no
good
to
anyone
as
it
is
and
the
loop
is
no
more
than
the
other
roads
have
now
i
thinking
it
the
chicago
city
railway
and
that
crowd
on
state
street
or
that
gas
crowd
that
talking
against
you
i
heard
them
before
give
them
what
they
want
and
it
a
fine
moral
cause
give
it
to
anyone
else
and
there
something
wrong
with
it
it
little
attention
i
pay
to
them
we
have
the
council
let
it
pass
the
ordinances
it
ca
be
proved
that
they
do
do
it
willingly
the
mayor
is
a
sensible
man
he
sign
them
let
young
macdonald
talk
if
he
wants
to
if
he
says
too
much
you
can
talk
to
his
father
as
for
hyssop
he
an
old
grandmother
anyhow
i
never
known
him
to
be
for
a
public
improvement
yet
that
was
really
good
for
chicago
unless
schryhart
or
merrill
or
arneel
or
someone
else
of
that
crowd
wanted
it
i
know
them
of
old
my
advice
is
to
go
ahead
and
never
mind
them
to
hell
with
them
things
will
be
sweet
enough
once
you
are
as
powerful
as
they
are
they
get
nothing
in
the
future
without
paying
for
it
it
little
enough
they
ever
done
to
further
anything
that
i
wanted
cowperwood
however
remained
cool
and
thoughtful
should
he
pay
young
macdonald
he
asked
himself
addison
knew
of
no
influence
that
he
could
bring
to
bear
finally
after
much
thought
he
decided
to
proceed
as
he
had
planned
consequently
the
reporters
around
the
city
hall
and
the
who
were
in
touch
with
alderman
thomas
dowling
mckenty
leader
on
the
floor
of
council
and
those
who
called
occasionally
quite
regularly
in
fact
at
the
offices
of
the
north
chicago
street
railway
company
cowperwood
comfortable
new
offices
in
the
north
side
were
now
given
to
understand
that
two
ordinances
one
granting
the
free
use
of
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
for
an
unlimited
period
practically
a
gift
of
it
and
another
granting
a
right
of
way
in
la
salle
munroe
dearborn
and
randolph
streets
for
the
proposed
loop
would
be
introduced
in
council
very
shortly
cowperwood
granted
a
very
flowery
interview
in
which
he
explained
quite
enthusiastically
all
that
the
north
chicago
company
was
doing
and
proposed
to
do
and
made
clear
what
a
splendid
development
it
would
assure
to
the
north
side
and
to
the
business
center
at
once
schryhart
merrill
and
some
individuals
connected
with
the
chicago
west
division
company
began
to
complain
in
the
newspaper
offices
and
at
the
clubs
to
ricketts
braxton
young
macdonald
and
the
other
editors
envy
of
the
pyrotechnic
progress
of
the
man
was
as
much
a
factor
in
this
as
anything
else
it
did
not
make
the
slightest
difference
as
cowperwood
had
sarcastically
pointed
out
that
every
other
corporation
of
any
significance
in
chicago
had
asked
and
received
without
money
and
without
price
somehow
his
career
in
connection
with
chicago
gas
his
venturesome
if
unsuccessful
effort
to
enter
chicago
society
his
philadelphia
record
rendered
the
sensitive
cohorts
of
the
exceedingly
fearful
in
schryhart
chronicle
appeared
a
news
column
which
was
headed
plain
grab
of
city
tunnel
proposed
it
was
a
very
truculent
statement
and
irritated
cowperwood
greatly
the
press
haguenin
paper
on
the
other
hand
was
most
cordial
to
the
idea
of
the
loop
while
appearing
to
be
a
little
uncertain
as
to
whether
the
tunnel
should
be
granted
without
compensation
or
not
editor
hyssop
felt
called
upon
to
insist
that
something
more
than
merely
nominal
compensation
should
be
made
for
the
tunnel
and
that
riders
should
be
inserted
in
the
loop
ordinance
making
it
incumbent
upon
the
north
chicago
company
to
keep
those
thoroughfares
in
full
repair
and
well
lighted
the
inquirer
under
macdonald
junior
and
du
bois
was
in
rumbling
opposition
no
free
tunnels
it
cried
no
free
ordinances
for
privileges
in
the
heart
it
had
nothing
to
say
about
cowperwood
personally
the
globe
braxton
paper
was
certain
that
no
free
rights
to
the
tunnel
should
be
given
and
that
a
much
better
route
for
the
loop
could
be
found
one
larger
and
more
serviceable
to
the
public
one
that
might
be
made
to
include
state
street
or
wabash
avenue
or
both
where
merrill
store
was
located
so
it
went
and
one
could
see
quite
clearly
to
what
extent
the
interests
of
the
public
figured
in
the
majority
of
these
particular
viewpoints
cowperwood
individual
reliant
utterly
indifferent
to
opposition
of
any
kind
was
somewhat
angered
by
the
manner
in
which
his
overtures
had
been
received
but
still
felt
that
the
best
way
out
of
his
troubles
was
to
follow
mckenty
advice
and
get
power
first
once
he
had
his
down
his
new
cars
running
the
tunnel
rebuilt
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
bridge
crush
disposed
of
the
public
would
see
what
a
vast
change
for
the
better
had
been
made
and
would
support
him
finally
all
things
were
in
readiness
and
the
ordinance
jammed
through
mckenty
being
a
little
dubious
of
the
outcome
had
a
brought
into
the
itself
during
the
hours
when
the
ordinances
were
up
for
consideration
in
this
he
sat
presumably
as
a
curious
spectator
actually
as
a
master
dictating
the
course
of
liquidation
in
hand
neither
cowperwood
nor
any
one
else
knew
of
mckenty
action
until
too
late
to
interfere
with
it
addison
and
videra
when
they
read
about
it
as
sneeringly
set
forth
in
the
news
columns
of
the
papers
lifted
and
then
wrinkled
their
eyebrows
that
looks
like
pretty
rough
work
to
me
commented
addison
i
thought
mckenty
had
more
tact
that
his
early
irish
training
alexander
rambaud
who
was
an
admirer
and
follower
of
cowperwood
wondered
whether
the
papers
were
lying
whether
it
really
could
be
true
that
cowperwood
had
a
serious
political
compact
with
mckenty
which
would
allow
him
to
walk
over
public
opinion
rambaud
considered
cowperwood
proposition
so
sane
and
reasonable
that
he
could
not
understand
why
there
should
be
serious
opposition
or
why
cowperwood
and
mckenty
should
have
to
resort
to
such
methods
however
the
streets
requisite
for
the
loop
were
granted
the
tunnel
was
leased
for
nine
hundred
and
years
at
the
nominal
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
per
year
it
was
understood
that
the
old
bridges
over
state
dearborn
and
clark
streets
should
be
put
in
repair
or
removed
but
there
was
a
joker
inserted
elsewhere
which
nullified
this
instantly
there
were
stormy
outbursts
in
the
chronicle
inquirer
and
globe
but
cowperwood
when
he
read
them
merely
smiled
let
them
grumble
he
said
to
himself
i
put
a
very
reasonable
proposition
before
them
why
should
they
complain
i
doing
more
now
than
the
chicago
city
railway
it
jealousy
that
all
if
schryhart
or
merrill
had
asked
for
it
there
would
have
been
no
complaint
mckenty
called
at
the
offices
of
the
chicago
trust
company
to
congratulate
cowperwood
the
boys
did
as
i
thought
they
would
he
said
i
had
to
be
there
though
for
i
heard
some
one
say
that
about
ten
of
them
intended
to
ditch
us
at
the
last
moment
good
work
good
work
replied
cowperwood
cheerfully
this
row
will
all
blow
over
it
would
be
the
same
whenever
we
asked
the
air
will
clear
up
we
give
them
such
a
fine
service
that
they
forget
all
about
this
and
be
glad
they
gave
us
the
tunnel
just
the
same
the
morning
after
the
enabling
ordinances
had
passed
there
was
much
derogatory
comment
in
influential
quarters
norman
schryhart
who
through
his
publisher
had
been
fulminating
defensively
against
cowperwood
stared
solemnly
at
ricketts
when
they
met
well
said
the
magnate
who
imagined
he
foresaw
a
threatened
attack
on
his
chicago
city
street
railway
preserves
i
see
our
friend
cowperwood
has
managed
to
get
his
own
way
with
the
council
i
am
morally
certain
he
uses
money
to
get
what
he
is
after
as
freely
as
a
fireman
uses
water
he
as
slippery
as
an
eel
i
should
be
glad
if
we
could
establish
that
there
is
a
community
of
interest
between
him
and
these
politicians
around
city
hall
or
between
him
and
mckenty
i
believe
he
has
set
out
to
dominate
this
city
politically
as
well
as
financially
and
he
need
constant
watching
if
public
opinion
can
be
aroused
against
him
he
may
be
dislodged
in
the
course
of
time
chicago
may
get
too
uncomfortable
for
him
i
know
mckenty
personally
but
he
is
not
the
kind
of
man
i
care
to
do
business
with
schryhart
method
of
negotiating
at
city
hall
was
through
certain
reputable
but
somewhat
lawyers
who
were
in
the
employ
of
the
south
side
company
they
had
never
been
able
to
reach
mckenty
at
all
ricketts
echoed
a
hearty
approval
you
very
right
he
said
with
owlish
smugness
adjusting
a
waistcoat
button
that
had
come
loose
and
smoothing
his
cuffs
he
a
prince
of
politicians
we
have
to
look
sharp
if
we
ever
trap
him
ricketts
would
have
been
glad
to
sell
out
to
cowperwood
if
he
had
not
been
so
heavily
obligated
to
schryhart
he
had
no
especial
affection
for
cowperwood
but
he
recognized
in
him
a
coming
man
young
macdonald
talking
to
clifford
du
bois
in
the
office
of
the
inquirer
and
reflecting
how
little
his
private
telephone
message
had
availed
him
was
in
a
waspish
ironic
frame
of
mind
well
he
said
it
seems
our
friend
cowperwood
has
taken
our
advice
he
may
make
his
mark
but
the
inquirer
is
through
with
him
by
a
long
shot
he
be
wanting
other
things
from
the
city
in
the
future
clifford
du
bois
regarded
his
acid
young
superior
with
a
curious
eye
he
knew
nothing
of
macdonald
private
telephone
message
to
cowperwood
but
he
knew
how
he
himself
would
have
dealt
with
the
crafty
financier
had
he
been
in
macdonald
position
yes
cowperwood
is
shrewd
was
his
comment
pritchard
our
political
man
says
the
ways
of
the
city
hall
are
greased
straight
up
to
the
mayor
and
mckenty
and
that
cowperwood
can
have
anything
he
wants
at
any
time
tom
dowling
eats
out
of
his
hand
and
you
know
what
that
means
old
general
van
sickle
is
working
for
him
in
some
way
did
you
ever
see
that
old
buzzard
flying
around
if
there
something
dead
in
the
woods
he
a
slick
one
remarked
macdonald
but
as
for
cowperwood
he
ca
get
away
with
this
sort
of
thing
very
long
he
going
too
fast
he
wants
too
much
du
bois
smiled
quite
secretly
it
amused
him
to
see
how
cowperwood
had
brushed
macdonald
and
his
objections
aside
dispensed
for
the
time
being
with
the
services
of
the
inquirer
du
bois
confidently
believed
that
if
the
old
general
had
been
at
home
he
would
have
supported
the
financier
within
eight
months
after
seizing
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
and
gobbling
four
of
the
principal
streets
for
his
loop
cowperwood
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
completion
of
the
second
part
of
the
programme
that
of
taking
over
the
washington
street
tunnel
and
the
chicago
west
division
company
which
was
still
drifting
along
under
its
old
regime
it
was
the
story
of
the
north
side
company
all
over
again
stockholders
of
a
certain
type
the
average
are
extremely
nervous
sensitive
fearsome
they
are
like
that
peculiar
bivalve
the
clam
which
at
the
slightest
sense
of
untoward
pressure
withdraws
into
its
shell
and
ceases
all
activity
the
city
tax
department
began
by
instituting
proceedings
against
the
west
division
company
compelling
them
to
disgorge
various
unpaid
taxes
which
had
hitherto
been
conveniently
neglected
the
city
highway
department
was
constantly
jumping
on
them
for
neglect
of
street
repairs
the
city
water
department
by
some
made
it
its
business
to
discover
that
they
had
been
stealing
water
on
the
other
hand
were
the
smiling
representatives
of
cowperwood
kaifrath
addison
videra
and
others
approaching
one
director
or
stockholder
after
another
with
glistening
accounts
of
what
a
splendid
day
would
set
in
for
the
chicago
west
division
company
if
only
it
would
lease
per
cent
of
its
holdings
per
cent
of
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
shares
par
value
two
hundred
dollars
for
the
fascinating
sum
of
six
hundred
dollars
per
share
and
thirty
per
cent
interest
on
all
stock
not
assumed
who
could
resist
starve
and
beat
a
dog
on
the
one
hand
wheedle
pet
and
hold
meat
in
front
of
it
on
the
other
and
it
can
soon
be
brought
to
perform
cowperwood
knew
this
his
emissaries
for
good
and
evil
were
tireless
in
the
end
and
it
was
not
long
in
coming
the
directors
and
chief
stockholders
of
the
chicago
west
division
company
succumbed
and
then
ho
the
sudden
leasing
by
the
chicago
west
division
company
of
all
its
property
to
the
north
chicago
street
railway
company
lessee
in
turn
of
the
chicago
city
passenger
railway
a
line
which
cowperwood
had
organized
to
take
over
the
washington
street
tunnel
how
had
he
accomplished
it
the
question
was
on
the
tip
of
every
financial
tongue
who
were
the
men
or
the
organization
providing
the
enormous
sums
necessary
to
pay
six
hundred
dollars
per
share
for
six
hundred
and
fifty
shares
of
the
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
belonging
to
the
old
west
division
company
and
thirty
per
cent
per
year
on
all
the
remainder
where
was
the
money
coming
from
to
cable
all
these
lines
it
was
simple
enough
if
they
had
only
thought
cowperwood
was
merely
capitalizing
the
future
before
the
newspapers
or
the
public
could
suitably
protest
crowds
of
men
were
at
work
day
and
night
in
the
business
heart
of
the
city
their
flaring
torches
and
resounding
hammers
making
a
fitful
bedlamic
world
of
that
region
they
were
laying
the
first
great
cable
loop
and
repairing
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
it
was
the
same
on
the
north
and
west
sides
where
concrete
conduits
were
being
laid
new
grip
and
trailer
cars
built
new
erected
and
large
shining
put
up
the
city
so
long
used
to
the
old
bridge
delays
the
stoveless
on
their
jumping
rails
was
agog
to
see
how
fine
this
new
service
would
be
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
was
soon
aglow
with
white
plaster
and
electric
lights
the
long
streets
and
avenues
of
the
north
side
were
threaded
with
conduits
and
heavy
the
powerhouses
were
completed
and
the
system
was
started
even
while
the
contracts
for
the
changes
on
the
west
side
were
being
let
schryhart
and
his
associates
were
amazed
at
this
swiftness
of
action
this
dizzy
phantasmagoria
of
financial
operations
it
looked
very
much
to
the
conservative
traction
interests
of
chicago
as
if
this
young
giant
out
of
the
east
had
it
in
mind
to
eat
up
the
whole
city
the
chicago
trust
company
which
he
addison
mckenty
and
others
had
organized
to
manipulate
the
principal
phases
of
the
local
bond
issues
and
of
which
he
was
rumored
to
be
in
control
was
in
a
flourishing
condition
apparently
he
could
now
write
his
check
for
millions
and
yet
he
was
not
beholden
so
far
as
the
older
and
more
conservative
multimillionaires
of
chicago
were
concerned
to
any
one
of
them
the
worst
of
it
was
that
this
cowperwood
an
upstart
a
a
stranger
whom
they
had
done
their
best
to
suppress
financially
and
ostracize
socially
had
now
become
an
attractive
even
a
sparkling
figure
in
the
eyes
of
the
chicago
public
his
views
and
opinions
on
almost
any
topic
were
freely
quoted
the
newspapers
even
the
most
antagonistic
did
not
dare
to
neglect
him
their
owners
were
now
fully
alive
to
the
fact
that
a
new
financial
rival
had
appeared
who
was
worthy
of
their
steel
chapter
xxvii
a
financier
bewitched
it
was
interesting
to
note
how
able
though
he
was
and
bound
up
with
this
vast
enterprise
which
was
beginning
to
affect
several
thousand
men
his
mind
could
find
intense
relief
and
satisfaction
in
the
presence
and
actions
of
stephanie
platow
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
in
her
perhaps
he
found
revivified
the
spirit
and
personality
of
rita
sohlberg
rita
however
had
not
contemplated
disloyalty
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
be
faithless
to
cowperwood
so
long
as
he
was
fond
of
her
any
more
than
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
possible
for
her
even
after
all
his
philanderings
to
be
faithless
to
sohlberg
stephanie
on
the
other
hand
had
the
strange
feeling
that
affection
was
not
necessarily
identified
with
physical
loyalty
and
that
she
could
be
fond
of
cowperwood
and
still
deceive
him
a
fact
which
was
based
on
her
lack
as
yet
of
a
true
enthusiasm
for
him
she
loved
him
and
she
did
her
attitude
was
not
necessarily
identified
with
her
heavy
lizardish
animality
though
that
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
rather
with
a
vague
kindly
generosity
which
permitted
her
to
feel
that
it
was
hard
to
break
with
gardner
knowles
and
lane
cross
after
they
had
been
so
nice
to
her
gardner
knowles
had
sung
her
praises
here
there
and
everywhere
and
was
attempting
to
spread
her
fame
among
the
legitimate
theatrical
enterprises
which
came
to
the
city
in
order
that
she
might
be
taken
up
and
made
into
a
significant
figure
lane
cross
was
wildly
fond
of
her
in
an
inadequate
way
which
made
it
hard
to
break
with
him
and
yet
certain
that
she
would
eventually
there
was
still
another
man
a
young
playwright
and
poet
by
the
name
of
forbes
gurney
tall
fair
passionate
who
had
newly
arrived
on
the
scene
and
was
courting
her
or
rather
being
courted
by
her
at
odd
moments
for
her
time
was
her
own
in
her
artistically
errant
way
she
had
refused
to
go
to
school
like
her
sister
and
was
idling
about
developing
as
she
phrased
it
her
artistic
possibilities
cowperwood
as
was
natural
heard
much
of
her
stage
life
at
first
he
took
all
this
palaver
with
a
grain
of
salt
the
babbling
of
an
ardent
nature
interested
in
the
flighty
romance
of
the
studio
world
by
degrees
however
he
became
curious
as
to
the
freedom
of
her
actions
the
ease
with
which
she
drifted
from
place
to
place
lane
studio
bliss
bridge
bachelor
rooms
where
he
appeared
always
to
be
receiving
his
theatrical
friends
of
the
garrick
players
gardner
knowles
home
on
the
near
north
side
where
he
was
frequently
entertaining
a
party
after
the
theater
it
seemed
to
cowperwood
to
say
the
least
that
stephanie
was
leading
a
rather
free
and
inconsequential
existence
and
yet
it
reflected
her
exactly
the
color
of
her
soul
but
he
began
to
doubt
and
wonder
where
were
you
stephanie
yesterday
he
would
ask
when
they
met
for
lunch
or
in
the
evenings
early
or
when
she
called
at
his
new
offices
on
the
north
side
as
she
sometimes
did
to
walk
or
drive
with
him
oh
yesterday
morning
i
was
at
lane
cross
studio
trying
on
some
of
his
indian
shawls
and
veils
he
has
such
a
lot
of
those
things
some
of
the
loveliest
oranges
and
blues
you
just
ought
to
see
me
in
them
i
wish
you
might
alone
for
a
while
i
thought
ethel
tuckerman
and
bliss
bridge
would
be
there
but
they
did
come
until
later
lane
cross
is
such
a
dear
he
sort
of
silly
at
times
but
i
like
him
his
portraits
are
so
bizarre
she
went
off
into
a
description
of
his
pretentious
but
insignificant
art
cowperwood
marveled
not
at
lane
cross
art
nor
his
shawls
but
at
this
world
in
which
stephanie
moved
he
could
not
quite
make
her
out
he
had
never
been
able
to
make
her
explain
satisfactorily
that
first
single
relationship
with
gardner
knowles
which
she
declared
had
ended
so
abruptly
since
then
he
had
doubted
as
was
his
nature
but
this
girl
was
so
sweet
childish
irreconcilable
with
herself
like
a
wandering
breath
of
air
or
a
flower
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
think
the
artistically
inclined
are
not
prone
to
quarrel
with
an
enticing
sheaf
of
flowers
she
was
heavenly
to
him
coming
in
as
she
did
at
times
when
he
was
alone
with
bland
eyes
and
yielding
herself
in
a
kind
of
summery
ecstasy
she
had
always
something
artistic
to
tell
of
storms
winds
dust
clouds
smoke
forms
the
outline
of
buildings
the
lake
the
stage
she
would
cuddle
in
his
arms
and
quote
long
sections
from
romeo
and
juliet
paolo
and
francesca
the
ring
and
the
book
keats
eve
of
st
agnes
he
hated
to
quarrel
with
her
because
she
was
like
a
wild
rose
or
some
art
form
in
nature
her
was
always
full
of
new
things
her
muff
or
the
light
silk
shawl
she
wore
in
summer
sometimes
concealed
a
modeled
figure
of
some
kind
which
she
would
produce
with
a
look
like
that
of
a
doubting
child
and
if
he
wanted
it
if
he
liked
it
he
could
have
it
cowperwood
meditated
deeply
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
think
the
constant
atmosphere
of
suspicion
and
doubt
in
which
he
was
compelled
to
remain
came
by
degrees
to
distress
and
anger
him
while
she
was
with
him
she
was
clinging
enough
but
when
she
was
away
she
was
ardently
cheerful
and
happy
unlike
the
station
he
had
occupied
in
so
many
previous
affairs
he
found
himself
after
the
first
little
while
asking
her
whether
she
loved
him
instead
of
submitting
to
the
same
question
from
her
he
thought
that
with
his
means
his
position
his
future
possibilities
he
had
the
power
to
bind
almost
any
woman
once
drawn
to
his
personality
but
stephanie
was
too
young
and
too
poetic
to
be
greatly
impaired
by
wealth
and
fame
and
she
was
not
yet
sufficiently
gripped
by
the
lure
of
him
she
loved
him
in
her
strange
way
but
she
was
interested
also
by
the
latest
arrival
forbes
gurney
this
tall
melancholy
youth
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
was
very
poor
he
hailed
from
southern
minnesota
and
what
between
a
penchant
for
journalism
and
some
dramatic
work
was
somewhat
undecided
as
to
his
future
his
present
occupation
was
that
of
an
instalment
collector
for
a
furniture
company
which
set
him
free
as
a
rule
at
three
in
the
afternoon
he
was
trying
in
a
mooning
way
to
identify
himself
with
the
chicago
newspaper
world
and
was
a
discovery
of
gardner
knowles
stephanie
had
seen
him
about
the
rooms
of
the
garrick
players
she
had
looked
at
his
longish
face
with
its
aureole
of
soft
crinkly
hair
his
fine
wide
mouth
eyes
and
good
nose
and
had
been
touched
by
an
atmosphere
of
wistfulness
or
let
us
say
gardner
knowles
brought
a
poem
of
his
once
which
he
had
borrowed
from
him
and
read
it
to
the
company
stephanie
ethel
tuckerman
lane
cross
and
irma
ottley
assembled
listen
to
this
knowles
had
suddenly
exclaimed
taking
it
out
of
his
pocket
it
concerned
a
garden
of
the
moon
with
the
fragrance
of
pale
blossoms
a
mystic
pool
some
ancient
figures
of
joy
a
quavered
lucidian
tune
with
eerie
flute
and
rhythmic
thrum
of
muted
strings
and
beaten
drum
stephanie
platow
had
sat
silent
caught
by
a
quality
that
was
akin
to
her
own
she
asked
to
see
it
and
read
it
in
silence
i
think
it
charming
she
said
thereafter
she
hovered
in
the
vicinity
of
forbes
gurney
why
she
could
scarcely
say
it
was
not
coquetry
she
just
drew
near
talked
to
him
of
stage
work
and
her
plays
and
her
ambitions
she
sketched
him
as
she
had
cowperwood
and
others
and
one
day
cowperwood
found
three
studies
of
forbes
gurney
in
her
idyllicly
done
a
note
of
romantic
feeling
about
them
who
is
this
he
asked
oh
he
a
young
poet
who
comes
up
to
the
players
forbes
gurney
so
charming
he
so
pale
and
dreamy
cowperwood
contemplated
the
sketches
curiously
his
eyes
clouded
another
one
of
stephanie
adherents
he
commented
teasingly
a
long
procession
i
joined
gardner
knowles
lane
cross
bliss
bridge
forbes
gurney
stephanie
merely
pouted
moodily
how
you
talk
bliss
bridge
gardner
knowles
i
admit
i
like
them
all
but
that
all
i
do
do
they
just
sweet
and
dear
you
like
lane
cross
yourself
he
such
a
foolish
old
polly
as
for
forbes
gurney
he
just
drifts
up
there
once
in
a
while
as
one
of
the
crowd
i
scarcely
know
him
exactly
said
cowperwood
dolefully
but
you
sketch
him
for
some
reason
cowperwood
did
not
believe
this
back
in
his
brain
he
did
not
believe
stephanie
at
all
he
did
not
trust
her
yet
he
was
intensely
fond
of
her
the
more
so
perhaps
because
of
this
tell
me
truly
stephanie
he
said
to
her
one
day
urgently
and
yet
very
diplomatically
i
do
care
at
all
so
far
as
your
past
is
concerned
you
and
i
are
close
enough
to
reach
a
perfect
understanding
but
you
did
tell
me
the
whole
truth
about
you
and
knowles
did
you
tell
me
truly
now
i
mind
i
can
understand
well
enough
how
it
could
have
happened
it
does
make
the
least
bit
of
difference
to
me
really
stephanie
was
off
her
guard
for
once
in
no
truly
fencing
mood
she
was
troubled
at
times
about
her
various
relations
anxious
to
put
herself
straight
with
cowperwood
or
with
any
one
whom
she
truly
liked
compared
to
cowperwood
and
his
affairs
cross
and
knowles
were
trivial
and
yet
knowles
was
interesting
to
her
compared
to
cowperwood
forbes
gurney
was
a
stripling
beggar
and
yet
gurney
had
what
cowperwood
did
not
have
a
sad
poetic
lure
he
awakened
her
sympathies
he
was
such
a
lonely
boy
cowperwood
was
so
strong
brilliant
magnetic
perhaps
it
was
with
some
idea
of
clearing
up
her
moral
status
generally
that
she
finally
said
well
i
did
tell
you
the
exact
truth
about
it
either
i
was
a
little
ashamed
to
at
the
close
of
her
confession
which
involved
only
knowles
and
was
incomplete
at
that
cowperwood
burned
with
a
kind
of
angry
resentment
why
trifle
with
a
lying
prostitute
that
she
was
an
inconsequential
free
lover
at
was
quite
plain
and
yet
there
was
something
so
strangely
large
about
the
girl
so
magnetic
and
she
was
so
beautiful
after
her
kind
that
he
could
not
think
of
giving
her
up
she
reminded
him
of
himself
well
stephanie
he
said
trampling
under
foot
an
impulse
to
insult
or
rebuke
and
dismiss
her
you
are
strange
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
i
have
asked
and
asked
do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
you
care
for
me
at
all
how
can
you
ask
that
she
demanded
reproachfully
feeling
that
she
had
been
rather
foolish
in
confessing
perhaps
she
would
lose
him
now
and
she
did
not
want
to
do
that
because
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
jealous
hardness
she
burst
into
tears
oh
i
wish
i
had
never
told
you
there
is
nothing
to
tell
anyhow
i
never
wanted
to
cowperwood
was
nonplussed
he
knew
human
nature
pretty
well
and
woman
nature
his
common
sense
told
him
that
this
girl
was
not
to
be
trusted
and
yet
he
was
drawn
to
her
perhaps
she
was
not
lying
and
these
tears
were
real
and
you
positively
assure
me
that
this
was
all
that
there
was
any
one
else
before
and
no
one
since
stephanie
dried
her
eyes
they
were
in
his
private
rooms
in
randolph
street
the
bachelor
rooms
he
had
fitted
for
himself
as
a
changing
place
for
various
affairs
i
do
believe
you
care
for
me
at
all
she
observed
dolefully
reproachfully
i
do
believe
you
understand
me
i
do
think
you
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
how
things
are
you
do
understand
i
do
lie
i
ca
if
you
are
so
doubting
now
perhaps
you
had
better
not
see
me
any
more
i
want
to
be
frank
with
you
but
if
you
wo
let
me
she
paused
heavily
gloomily
very
sorrowfully
and
cowperwood
surveyed
her
with
a
kind
of
yearning
what
an
unreasoning
pull
she
had
for
him
he
did
not
believe
her
and
yet
he
could
not
let
her
go
oh
i
do
know
what
to
think
he
commented
morosely
i
certainly
do
want
to
quarrel
with
you
stephanie
for
telling
me
the
truth
please
do
deceive
me
you
are
a
remarkable
girl
i
can
do
so
much
for
you
if
you
will
let
me
you
ought
to
see
that
but
i
not
deceiving
you
she
repeated
wearily
i
should
think
you
could
see
i
believe
you
he
went
on
trying
to
deceive
himself
against
his
better
judgment
but
you
lead
such
a
free
unconventional
life
ah
thought
stephanie
perhaps
i
talk
too
much
i
am
very
fond
of
you
you
appeal
to
me
so
much
i
love
you
really
do
deceive
me
do
run
with
all
these
silly
simpletons
they
are
really
not
worthy
of
you
i
shall
be
able
to
get
a
divorce
one
of
these
days
and
then
i
would
be
glad
to
marry
you
but
i
not
running
with
them
in
the
sense
that
you
think
not
anything
to
me
beyond
mere
entertainment
oh
i
like
them
of
course
lane
cross
is
a
dear
in
his
way
and
so
is
gardner
knowles
they
have
all
been
nice
to
me
cowperwood
gorge
rose
at
her
calling
lane
cross
dear
it
incensed
him
and
yet
he
held
his
peace
do
give
me
your
word
that
there
will
never
be
anything
between
you
and
any
of
these
men
so
long
as
you
are
friendly
with
me
he
almost
pleaded
a
strange
role
for
him
i
do
care
to
share
you
with
any
one
else
i
wo
i
do
mind
what
you
have
done
in
the
past
but
i
do
want
you
to
be
unfaithful
in
the
future
what
a
question
of
course
i
wo
but
if
you
do
believe
me
oh
dear
stephanie
sighed
painfully
and
cowperwood
face
clouded
with
angry
though
suspicion
and
jealousy
well
i
tell
you
stephanie
i
believe
you
now
i
going
to
take
your
word
but
if
you
do
deceive
me
and
i
should
find
it
out
i
will
quit
you
the
same
day
i
do
not
care
to
share
you
with
any
one
else
what
i
ca
understand
if
you
care
for
me
is
how
you
can
take
so
much
interest
in
all
these
affairs
it
certainly
is
devotion
to
your
art
that
impelling
you
is
it
oh
are
you
going
to
go
on
quarreling
with
me
asked
stephanie
naively
wo
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
love
you
perhaps
but
here
her
histrionic
ability
came
to
her
aid
and
she
sobbed
violently
cowperwood
took
her
in
his
arms
never
mind
he
soothed
i
do
believe
you
i
do
think
you
care
for
me
only
i
wish
you
were
such
a
butterfly
temperament
stephanie
so
this
particular
lesion
for
the
time
being
was
healed
chapter
xxviii
the
exposure
of
stephanie
at
the
same
time
the
thought
of
readjusting
her
relations
so
that
they
would
avoid
disloyalty
to
cowperwood
was
never
further
from
mind
let
no
one
quarrel
with
stephanie
platow
she
was
an
unstable
chemical
compound
artistic
to
her
not
understood
or
properly
guarded
by
her
family
her
interest
in
cowperwood
his
force
and
ability
was
intense
so
was
her
interest
in
forbes
gurney
the
atmosphere
of
poetry
that
enveloped
him
she
studied
him
curiously
on
the
various
occasions
when
they
met
and
finding
him
bashful
and
recessive
set
out
to
lure
him
she
felt
that
he
was
lonely
and
depressed
and
poor
and
her
womanly
capacity
for
sympathy
naturally
bade
her
be
tender
her
end
was
easily
achieved
one
night
when
they
were
all
out
in
bliss
bridge
a
saucer
stephanie
and
forbes
gurney
sat
forward
of
the
mast
looking
at
the
silver
moon
track
which
was
directly
ahead
the
rest
were
in
the
cockpit
cutting
up
laughing
and
singing
it
was
very
plain
to
all
that
stephanie
was
becoming
interested
in
forbes
gurney
and
since
he
was
charming
and
she
wilful
nothing
was
done
to
interfere
with
them
except
to
throw
an
occasional
jest
their
way
gurney
new
to
love
and
romance
scarcely
knew
how
to
take
his
good
fortune
how
to
begin
he
told
stephanie
of
his
home
life
in
the
of
the
northwest
how
his
family
had
moved
from
ohio
when
he
was
three
and
how
difficult
were
the
labors
he
had
always
undergone
he
had
stopped
in
his
plowing
many
a
day
to
stand
under
a
tree
and
write
a
poem
such
as
it
was
or
to
watch
the
birds
or
to
wish
he
could
go
to
college
or
to
chicago
she
looked
at
him
with
dreamy
eyes
her
dark
skin
turned
a
copper
bronze
in
the
moonlight
her
black
hair
irradiated
with
a
strange
luminous
grayish
blue
forbes
gurney
alive
to
beauty
in
all
its
forms
ventured
finally
to
touch
her
hand
she
of
knowles
cross
and
cowperwood
and
she
thrilled
from
head
to
toe
this
boy
was
so
sweet
his
curly
brown
hair
gave
him
a
kind
of
greek
innocence
and
aspect
she
did
not
move
but
waited
hoping
he
would
do
more
i
wish
i
might
talk
to
you
as
i
feel
he
finally
said
hoarsely
a
catch
in
his
throat
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
you
dear
she
said
he
realized
now
that
he
might
a
great
ecstasy
fell
upon
him
he
smoothed
her
hand
then
slipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
then
ventured
to
kiss
the
dark
cheek
turned
dreamily
from
him
artfully
her
head
sunk
to
his
shoulder
and
he
murmured
wild
nothings
how
divine
she
was
how
artistic
how
wonderful
with
her
view
of
things
it
could
only
end
one
way
she
manoeuvered
him
into
calling
on
her
at
her
home
into
studying
her
books
and
plays
on
the
into
hearing
her
sing
once
fully
in
his
arms
the
rest
was
easy
by
suggestion
he
learned
she
was
no
longer
innocent
and
then
in
the
mean
time
cowperwood
mingled
his
speculations
concerning
large
immense
reciprocating
engines
the
problem
of
a
wage
scale
for
his
now
two
thousand
employees
some
of
whom
were
threatening
to
strike
the
problem
of
securing
bonding
and
equipping
the
la
salle
street
tunnel
and
a
loop
in
la
salle
munroe
dearborn
and
randolph
streets
with
mental
inquiries
and
pictures
as
to
what
possibly
stephanie
platow
might
be
doing
he
could
only
make
appointments
with
her
from
time
to
time
he
did
not
fail
to
note
that
after
he
began
to
make
use
of
information
she
let
drop
as
to
her
whereabouts
from
day
to
day
and
her
free
companionship
he
heard
less
of
gardner
knowles
lane
cross
and
forbes
gurney
and
more
of
georgia
timberlake
and
ethel
tuckerman
why
this
sudden
reticence
on
one
occasion
she
did
say
of
forbes
gurney
that
he
was
having
such
a
hard
time
and
that
his
clothes
were
as
nice
as
they
should
be
poor
dear
stephanie
herself
owing
to
gifts
made
to
her
by
cowperwood
was
resplendent
these
days
she
took
just
enough
to
complete
her
wardrobe
according
to
her
taste
why
not
send
him
to
me
cowperwood
asked
i
might
find
something
to
do
for
him
he
would
have
been
perfectly
willing
to
put
him
in
some
position
where
he
could
keep
track
of
his
time
however
gurney
never
sought
him
for
a
position
and
stephanie
ceased
to
speak
of
his
poverty
a
gift
of
two
hundred
dollars
which
cowperwood
made
her
in
june
was
followed
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
her
and
gurney
in
washington
street
gurney
pale
and
pleasant
was
very
well
dressed
indeed
he
wore
a
pin
which
cowperwood
knew
had
once
belonged
to
stephanie
she
was
in
no
way
confused
finally
stephanie
let
it
out
that
lane
cross
who
had
gone
to
new
hampshire
for
the
summer
had
left
his
studio
in
her
charge
cowperwood
decided
to
have
this
studio
watched
there
was
in
cowperwood
employ
at
this
time
a
young
newspaper
man
an
ambitious
spark
aged
by
the
name
of
francis
kennedy
he
had
written
a
very
intelligent
article
for
the
sunday
inquirer
describing
cowperwood
and
his
plans
and
pointing
out
what
a
remarkable
man
he
was
this
pleased
cowperwood
when
kennedy
called
one
day
announcing
smartly
that
he
was
anxious
to
get
out
of
reportorial
work
and
inquiring
whether
he
could
find
something
to
do
in
the
world
cowperwood
saw
in
him
a
possibly
useful
tool
i
try
you
out
as
secretary
for
a
while
he
said
pleasantly
there
are
a
few
special
things
i
want
done
if
you
succeed
in
those
i
may
find
something
else
for
you
later
kennedy
had
been
working
for
him
only
a
little
while
when
he
said
to
him
one
day
francis
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
forbes
gurney
in
the
newspaper
world
they
were
in
cowperwood
private
office
no
sir
replied
francis
briskly
you
have
heard
of
an
organization
called
the
garrick
players
you
yes
sir
well
francis
do
you
suppose
you
could
undertake
a
little
piece
of
detective
work
for
me
and
handle
it
intelligently
and
quietly
i
think
so
said
francis
who
was
the
pink
of
perfection
this
morning
in
a
brown
suit
garnet
tie
and
sard
his
shoes
were
immaculately
polished
and
his
young
healthy
face
glistened
i
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
there
is
a
young
actress
or
amateur
actress
by
the
name
of
stephanie
platow
who
frequents
the
studio
of
an
artist
named
cross
in
the
new
arts
building
she
may
even
occupy
it
in
his
absence
i
do
know
i
want
you
to
find
out
for
me
what
the
relations
of
gurney
and
this
woman
are
i
have
certain
business
reasons
for
wanting
to
know
young
kennedy
was
all
attention
you
could
tell
me
where
i
could
find
out
anything
about
this
gurney
to
begin
with
could
you
he
asked
i
think
he
is
a
friend
of
a
critic
here
by
the
name
of
gardner
knowles
you
might
ask
him
i
need
not
say
that
you
must
never
mention
me
oh
i
understand
that
thoroughly
mr
cowperwood
young
kennedy
departed
meditating
how
was
he
to
do
this
with
true
journalistic
skill
he
first
sought
other
newspaper
men
from
whom
he
learned
a
bit
from
one
and
a
scrap
from
another
of
the
character
of
the
garrick
players
and
of
the
women
who
belonged
to
it
he
pretended
to
be
writing
a
play
which
he
hoped
to
have
produced
he
then
visited
lane
cross
studio
posing
as
a
newspaper
interviewer
cross
was
out
of
town
so
the
elevator
man
said
his
studio
was
closed
kennedy
meditated
on
this
fact
for
a
moment
does
any
one
use
his
studio
during
the
summer
months
he
asked
i
believe
there
is
a
young
woman
who
comes
here
yes
you
do
happen
to
know
who
it
is
yes
i
do
her
name
is
platow
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
looky
here
exclaimed
kennedy
surveying
the
rather
shabby
attendant
with
a
cordial
and
persuasive
eye
do
you
want
to
make
some
money
five
or
ten
dollars
and
without
any
trouble
to
you
the
elevator
man
whose
wages
were
exactly
eight
dollars
a
week
pricked
up
his
ears
i
want
to
know
who
comes
here
with
this
miss
platow
when
they
come
all
about
it
i
make
it
fifteen
dollars
if
i
find
out
what
i
want
and
i
give
you
five
right
now
the
elevator
factotum
had
just
cents
in
his
pocket
at
the
time
he
looked
at
kennedy
with
some
uncertainty
and
much
desire
well
what
can
i
do
he
repeated
i
not
here
after
six
the
janitor
runs
this
elevator
from
six
to
twelve
there
is
a
room
vacant
anywhere
near
this
one
is
there
kennedy
asked
speculatively
the
factotum
thought
yes
there
is
one
just
across
the
hall
what
time
does
she
come
here
as
a
rule
i
do
know
anything
about
nights
in
the
day
she
sometimes
comes
mornings
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
anybody
with
her
sometimes
a
man
sometimes
a
girl
or
two
i
have
really
paid
much
attention
to
her
to
tell
you
the
truth
kennedy
walked
away
whistling
from
this
day
on
kennedy
became
a
watcher
over
this
very
unconventional
atmosphere
he
was
in
and
out
principally
observing
the
comings
and
goings
of
gurney
he
found
what
he
naturally
suspected
that
gurney
and
stephanie
spent
hours
here
at
peculiar
times
after
a
company
of
friends
had
jollified
for
instance
and
all
had
left
including
gurney
when
the
latter
would
quietly
return
with
stephanie
sometimes
if
she
had
left
with
the
others
alone
if
she
had
remained
behind
the
visits
were
of
varying
duration
and
kennedy
to
be
absolutely
accurate
kept
days
dates
the
duration
of
the
hours
which
he
left
noted
in
a
sealed
envelope
for
cowperwood
in
the
morning
cowperwood
was
enraged
but
so
great
was
his
interest
in
stephanie
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
act
he
wanted
to
see
to
what
extent
her
duplicity
would
go
the
novelty
of
this
atmosphere
and
its
effect
on
him
was
astonishing
although
his
mind
was
vigorously
employed
during
the
day
nevertheless
his
thoughts
kept
returning
constantly
where
was
she
what
was
she
doing
the
bland
way
in
which
she
could
lie
reminded
him
of
himself
to
think
that
she
should
prefer
any
one
else
to
him
especially
at
this
time
when
he
was
shining
as
a
great
constructive
factor
in
the
city
was
too
much
it
smacked
of
age
his
ultimate
displacement
by
youth
it
cut
and
hurt
one
morning
after
a
peculiarly
exasperating
night
of
thought
concerning
her
he
said
to
young
kennedy
i
have
a
suggestion
for
you
i
wish
you
would
get
this
elevator
man
you
are
working
with
down
there
to
get
you
a
duplicate
key
to
this
studio
and
see
if
there
is
a
bolt
on
the
inside
let
me
know
when
you
do
bring
me
the
key
the
next
time
she
is
there
of
an
evening
with
gurney
step
out
and
telephone
me
the
climax
came
one
night
several
weeks
after
this
discouraging
investigation
began
there
was
a
heavy
yellow
moon
in
the
sky
and
a
warm
sweet
summer
wind
was
blowing
stephanie
had
called
on
cowperwood
at
his
office
about
four
to
say
that
instead
of
staying
with
him
as
they
had
casually
planned
she
was
going
to
her
home
on
the
west
side
to
attend
a
of
some
kind
at
georgia
timberlake
cowperwood
looked
at
her
with
for
him
a
morbid
eye
he
was
all
cheer
geniality
pleasant
badinage
but
he
was
thinking
all
the
while
what
a
shameless
enigma
she
was
how
well
she
played
her
part
what
a
fool
she
must
take
him
to
be
he
gave
her
youth
her
passion
her
attractiveness
her
natural
promiscuity
of
soul
due
credit
but
he
could
not
forgive
her
for
not
loving
him
perfectly
as
had
so
many
others
she
had
on
a
summery
frock
and
a
fetching
brown
leghorn
hat
which
with
a
poppy
ornamenting
a
flare
over
her
left
ear
and
a
peculiar
ruching
of
silk
about
the
crown
made
her
seem
strangely
young
debonair
a
study
in
hebraic
and
american
origins
going
to
have
a
nice
time
are
you
he
asked
genially
politically
eying
her
in
his
enigmatic
and
inscrutable
way
going
to
shine
among
that
charming
company
you
keep
i
suppose
all
the
standbys
will
be
there
bliss
bridge
knowles
cross
dancing
attendance
on
you
he
failed
to
mention
gurney
stephanie
nodded
cheerfully
she
seemed
in
an
innocent
outing
mood
cowperwood
smiled
thinking
how
one
of
these
days
very
shortly
perhaps
he
was
certain
to
take
a
signal
revenge
he
would
catch
her
in
a
lie
in
a
compromising
position
somewhere
in
this
studio
perhaps
and
dismiss
her
with
contempt
in
an
elder
day
if
they
had
lived
in
turkey
he
would
have
had
her
strangled
sewn
in
a
sack
and
thrown
into
the
bosporus
as
it
was
he
could
only
dismiss
her
he
smiled
and
smiled
smoothing
her
hand
have
a
good
time
he
called
as
she
left
later
at
his
own
home
it
was
nearly
midnight
kennedy
called
him
up
mr
cowperwood
yes
you
know
the
studio
in
the
new
arts
building
yes
it
is
occupied
now
cowperwood
called
a
servant
to
bring
him
his
runabout
he
had
had
a
locksmith
make
a
round
keystem
with
a
bored
clutch
at
the
end
of
it
a
hollow
which
would
fit
over
the
end
of
such
a
key
as
he
had
to
the
studio
and
turn
it
easily
from
the
outside
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
it
jumped
in
his
runabout
and
hurried
away
when
he
reached
the
new
arts
building
he
found
kennedy
in
the
hall
and
dismissed
him
thanks
he
observed
brusquely
i
will
take
care
of
this
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
avoiding
the
elevator
to
the
vacant
room
opposite
and
thence
reconnoitered
the
studio
door
it
was
as
kennedy
had
reported
stephanie
was
there
and
with
gurney
the
pale
poet
had
been
brought
there
to
furnish
her
an
evening
of
delight
because
of
the
stillness
of
the
building
at
this
hour
he
could
hear
their
muffled
voices
speaking
alternately
and
once
stephanie
singing
the
refrain
of
a
song
he
was
angry
and
yet
grateful
that
she
had
in
her
genial
way
taken
the
trouble
to
call
and
assure
him
that
she
was
going
to
a
summer
and
dance
he
smiled
grimly
sarcastically
as
he
thought
of
her
surprise
softly
he
extracted
the
and
inserted
it
covering
the
end
of
the
key
on
the
inside
and
turning
it
it
gave
solidly
without
sound
he
next
tried
the
knob
and
turned
it
feeling
the
door
spring
slightly
as
he
did
so
then
inaudibly
because
of
a
gurgled
laugh
with
which
he
was
thoroughly
familiar
he
opened
it
and
stepped
in
at
his
rough
firm
cough
they
sprang
up
gurney
to
a
hiding
position
behind
a
curtain
stephanie
to
one
of
concealment
behind
draperies
on
the
couch
she
could
not
speak
and
could
scarcely
believe
that
her
eyes
did
not
deceive
her
gurney
masculine
and
defiant
but
by
no
means
well
composed
demanded
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
here
cowperwood
replied
very
simply
and
smilingly
not
very
much
perhaps
miss
platow
there
will
tell
you
he
nodded
in
her
direction
stephanie
fixed
by
his
cold
examining
eye
shrank
nervously
ignoring
gurney
entirely
the
latter
perceived
on
the
instant
that
he
had
a
previous
liaison
to
deal
with
an
angry
and
outraged
lover
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
act
either
wisely
or
well
gurney
said
cowperwood
complacently
after
staring
at
stephanie
grimly
and
scorching
her
with
his
scorn
i
have
no
concern
with
you
and
do
not
propose
to
do
anything
to
disturb
you
or
miss
platow
after
a
very
few
moments
i
am
not
here
without
reason
this
young
woman
has
been
steadily
deceiving
me
she
has
lied
to
me
frequently
and
pretended
an
innocence
which
i
did
not
believe
she
told
me
she
was
to
be
at
a
on
the
west
side
she
has
been
my
mistress
for
months
i
have
given
her
money
jewelry
whatever
she
wanted
those
jade
by
the
way
are
one
of
my
gifts
he
nodded
cheerfully
in
stephanie
direction
i
have
come
here
simply
to
prove
to
her
that
she
can
not
lie
to
me
any
more
heretofore
every
time
i
have
accused
her
of
things
like
this
she
has
cried
and
lied
i
do
not
know
how
much
you
know
of
her
or
how
fond
you
are
of
her
i
merely
wish
her
not
you
to
know
and
he
turned
and
stared
at
stephanie
that
the
day
of
her
lying
to
me
is
over
during
this
very
peculiar
harangue
stephanie
who
nervous
fearful
fixed
and
yet
beautiful
remained
curled
up
in
the
corner
of
the
suggestive
oriental
divan
had
been
gazing
at
cowperwood
in
a
way
which
plainly
attested
trifle
as
she
might
with
others
that
she
was
nevertheless
fond
of
him
intensely
so
his
strong
solid
figure
confronting
her
so
ruthlessly
gripped
her
imagination
of
which
she
had
a
world
she
had
managed
to
conceal
her
body
in
part
but
her
brown
arms
and
shoulders
her
bosom
trim
knees
and
feet
were
exposed
in
part
her
black
hair
and
naive
face
were
now
heavy
distressed
sad
she
was
frightened
really
for
cowperwood
at
bottom
had
always
overawed
her
a
strange
terrible
fascinating
man
now
she
sat
and
looked
seeking
still
to
lure
him
by
the
pathetic
cast
of
her
face
and
soul
while
cowperwood
scornful
of
her
and
almost
openly
contemptuous
of
her
lover
and
his
possible
opposition
merely
stood
smiling
before
them
it
came
over
her
very
swiftly
now
just
what
it
was
she
was
losing
a
grim
wonderful
man
beside
him
gurney
the
pale
poet
was
rather
thin
a
mere
breath
of
romance
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
make
a
plea
but
it
was
so
plain
cowperwood
would
have
none
of
it
and
besides
here
was
gurney
her
throat
clogged
her
eyes
filled
even
here
and
a
mystical
state
of
emotion
succeeded
the
primary
one
of
opposition
cowperwood
knew
the
look
well
it
gave
him
the
only
sense
of
triumph
he
had
stephanie
he
remarked
i
have
just
one
word
to
say
to
you
now
we
will
not
meet
any
more
of
course
you
are
a
good
actress
stick
to
your
profession
you
may
shine
in
it
if
you
do
not
merge
it
too
completely
with
your
loves
as
for
being
a
free
lover
it
incompatible
with
what
you
are
perhaps
but
it
is
socially
advisable
for
you
good
night
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
out
oh
frank
called
stephanie
in
a
strange
magnetized
despairing
way
even
in
the
face
of
her
astonished
lover
gurney
stared
with
his
mouth
open
cowperwood
paid
no
heed
out
he
went
through
the
dark
hall
and
down
the
stairs
for
once
the
lure
of
a
beautiful
enigmatic
immoral
and
promiscuous
woman
poison
flower
though
she
was
was
haunting
him
d
her
he
exclaimed
d
the
little
beast
anyhow
the
the
he
used
terms
so
hard
so
vile
so
sad
all
because
he
knew
for
once
what
it
was
to
love
and
lose
to
want
ardently
in
his
way
and
not
to
have
now
or
ever
after
he
was
determined
that
his
path
and
that
of
stephanie
platow
should
never
be
allowed
to
cross
again
chapter
xxix
a
family
quarrel
it
chanced
that
shortly
before
this
liaison
was
broken
off
some
troubling
information
was
quite
innocently
conveyed
to
aileen
by
stephanie
platow
own
mother
one
day
platow
in
calling
on
cowperwood
commented
on
the
fact
that
stephanie
was
gradually
improving
in
her
art
that
the
garrick
players
had
experienced
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
that
stephanie
was
shortly
to
appear
in
a
new
role
something
chinese
that
was
such
a
charming
set
of
jade
you
gave
her
she
volunteered
genially
i
only
saw
it
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
she
never
told
me
about
it
before
she
prizes
it
so
very
highly
that
i
feel
as
though
i
ought
to
thank
you
myself
aileen
opened
her
eyes
jade
she
observed
curiously
why
i
do
remember
recalling
cowperwood
proclivities
on
the
instant
she
was
suspicious
distraught
her
face
showed
her
perplexity
why
yes
replied
platow
aileen
show
of
surprise
troubling
her
the
and
necklet
you
know
she
said
you
gave
them
to
her
to
be
sure
answered
aileen
catching
herself
as
by
a
hair
i
do
recall
it
now
but
it
was
frank
who
really
gave
them
i
hope
she
likes
them
she
smiled
sweetly
she
thinks
they
beautiful
and
they
do
become
her
continued
platow
pleasantly
understanding
it
all
as
she
fancied
the
truth
was
that
stephanie
having
forgotten
had
left
her
box
open
one
day
at
home
and
her
mother
rummaging
in
her
room
for
something
had
discovered
them
and
genially
confronted
her
with
them
for
she
knew
the
value
of
jade
nonplussed
for
the
moment
stephanie
had
lost
her
mental
though
not
her
outward
composure
and
referred
them
back
casually
to
an
evening
at
the
cowperwood
home
when
aileen
had
been
present
and
the
gauds
had
been
genially
forced
upon
her
unfortunately
for
aileen
the
matter
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
rest
just
so
for
going
one
afternoon
to
a
reception
given
by
rhees
crier
a
young
sculptor
of
social
proclivities
who
had
been
introduced
to
her
by
taylor
lord
she
was
given
a
taste
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
neglected
wife
from
a
public
point
of
view
as
she
entered
on
this
occasion
she
happened
to
overhear
two
women
talking
in
a
corner
behind
a
screen
erected
to
conceal
wraps
oh
here
comes
cowperwood
said
one
she
the
magnate
wife
last
winter
and
spring
he
was
running
with
that
platow
girl
of
the
garrick
players
you
know
the
other
nodded
studying
aileen
splendiferous
green
velvet
gown
with
envy
i
wonder
if
she
faithful
to
him
she
queried
while
aileen
strained
to
hear
she
looks
daring
enough
aileen
managed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
observers
later
when
they
were
not
looking
and
her
face
showed
her
mingled
resentment
and
feeling
but
it
did
no
good
the
wretched
gossipers
had
wounded
her
in
the
keenest
way
she
was
hurt
angry
nonplussed
to
think
that
cowperwood
by
his
variability
should
expose
her
to
such
gossip
as
this
one
day
not
so
long
after
her
conversation
with
platow
aileen
happened
to
be
standing
outside
the
door
of
her
own
boudoir
the
landing
of
which
commanded
the
lower
hall
and
there
overheard
two
of
her
servants
discussing
the
cowperwood
menage
in
particular
and
chicago
life
in
general
one
was
a
tall
angular
girl
of
perhaps
or
eight
a
chambermaid
the
other
a
short
stout
woman
of
forty
who
held
the
position
of
assistant
housekeeper
they
were
pretending
to
dust
though
gossip
conducted
in
a
whisper
was
the
matter
for
which
they
were
foregathered
the
tall
girl
had
recently
been
employed
in
the
family
of
aymar
cochrane
the
former
president
of
the
chicago
west
division
railway
and
now
a
director
of
the
new
west
chicago
street
railway
company
and
i
was
that
surprised
aileen
heard
this
girl
saying
to
think
i
should
be
coming
here
i
cud
scarcely
believe
me
ears
when
they
told
me
why
miss
florence
was
runnin
out
to
meet
him
two
and
three
times
in
the
week
the
wonder
to
me
was
that
her
mother
never
guessed
och
replied
the
other
he
the
very
divil
and
all
when
it
comes
to
the
wimmin
aileen
did
not
see
the
upward
lift
of
the
hand
that
accompanied
this
there
was
a
little
girl
that
used
to
come
here
her
father
lives
up
the
street
here
haguenin
is
his
name
he
owns
that
morning
paper
the
press
and
has
a
fine
house
up
the
street
here
a
little
way
well
i
have
seen
her
very
often
of
late
but
more
than
once
i
saw
him
kissing
her
in
this
very
room
sure
his
wife
knows
all
about
it
depend
on
it
she
had
an
awful
fight
with
some
woman
here
onct
so
i
hear
some
woman
that
he
was
runnin
with
and
here
to
the
house
i
hear
it
somethin
terrible
the
way
she
beat
her
up
screamin
and
carryin
on
oh
they
the
divil
these
men
when
it
comes
to
the
wimmin
a
slight
rustling
sound
from
somewhere
sent
the
two
gossipers
on
their
several
ways
but
aileen
had
heard
enough
to
understand
what
was
she
to
do
how
was
she
to
learn
more
of
these
new
women
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
at
all
she
at
once
suspected
florence
cochrane
for
she
knew
that
this
servant
had
worked
in
the
cochrane
family
and
then
cecily
haguenin
the
daughter
of
the
editor
with
whom
they
were
on
the
friendliest
terms
cowperwood
kissing
her
was
there
no
end
to
his
liaisons
his
infidelity
she
returned
fretting
and
grieving
to
her
room
where
she
meditated
and
meditated
wondering
whether
she
should
leave
him
wondering
whether
she
should
reproach
him
openly
wondering
whether
she
should
employ
more
detectives
what
good
would
it
do
she
had
employed
detectives
once
had
it
prevented
the
stephanie
platow
incident
not
at
all
would
it
prevent
other
liaisons
in
the
future
very
likely
not
obviously
her
home
life
with
cowperwood
was
coming
to
a
complete
and
disastrous
end
things
could
not
go
on
in
this
way
she
had
done
wrong
possibly
in
taking
him
away
from
cowperwood
number
one
though
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
for
lillian
cowperwood
was
so
unsuited
to
him
but
this
repayment
if
she
had
been
at
all
superstitious
or
religious
and
had
known
her
bible
which
she
did
she
might
have
quoted
to
herself
that
very
fatalistic
statement
of
the
new
testament
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
unto
you
again
the
truth
was
that
cowperwood
continued
propensity
to
rove
at
liberty
among
the
fair
sex
could
not
in
the
long
run
fail
of
some
results
of
an
unsatisfactory
character
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
stephanie
platow
he
launched
upon
a
variety
of
episodes
the
charming
daughter
of
so
worthy
a
man
as
editor
haguenin
his
sincerest
and
most
sympathetic
journalistic
supporter
and
the
daughter
of
aymar
cochrane
falling
victims
among
others
to
what
many
would
have
called
his
wiles
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
most
cases
he
was
as
much
sinned
against
as
sinning
since
the
provocation
was
as
much
offered
as
given
the
manner
in
which
he
came
to
get
in
with
cecily
haguenin
was
simple
enough
being
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
a
frequent
visitor
at
her
father
house
he
found
this
particular
daughter
of
desire
an
easy
victim
she
was
a
vigorous
blonde
creature
of
twenty
at
this
time
very
full
and
plump
with
large
violet
eyes
and
with
considerable
alertness
of
mind
a
sort
of
doll
girl
with
whom
cowperwood
found
it
pleasant
to
amuse
himself
a
playful
gamboling
relationship
had
existed
between
them
when
she
was
a
mere
child
attending
school
and
had
continued
through
her
college
years
whenever
she
happened
to
be
at
home
on
a
vacation
in
these
very
latest
days
when
cowperwood
on
occasion
sat
in
the
haguenin
library
consulting
with
the
concerning
certain
moves
which
he
wished
to
have
put
right
before
the
public
he
saw
considerably
more
of
cecily
one
night
when
her
father
had
gone
out
to
look
up
the
previous
action
of
the
city
council
in
connection
with
some
matter
of
franchises
a
series
of
more
or
less
sympathetic
and
understanding
glances
suddenly
culminated
in
cecily
playfully
waving
a
new
novel
which
she
happened
to
have
in
her
hand
in
cowperwood
face
and
he
in
reply
laid
hold
caressingly
of
her
arms
you
ca
stop
me
so
easily
she
observed
banteringly
oh
yes
i
can
he
replied
a
slight
struggle
ensued
in
which
he
with
her
semiwilful
connivance
managed
to
manoeuver
her
into
his
arms
her
head
backward
against
his
shoulder
well
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
glance
now
what
you
just
have
to
let
me
go
not
very
soon
though
oh
yes
you
will
my
father
will
be
here
in
a
moment
well
not
until
then
anyhow
you
getting
to
be
the
sweetest
girl
she
did
not
resist
but
remained
gazing
half
nervously
half
dreamily
at
him
whereupon
he
smoothed
her
cheek
and
then
kissed
her
her
father
returning
step
put
an
end
to
this
but
from
this
point
on
ascent
or
descent
to
a
perfect
understanding
was
easily
made
in
the
matter
of
florence
cochrane
the
daughter
of
aymar
cochrane
the
president
of
the
chicago
west
division
company
a
second
affair
of
the
period
the
approach
was
only
slightly
different
the
result
the
same
this
girl
to
furnish
only
a
brief
impression
was
a
blonde
of
a
different
type
from
cecily
delicate
picturesque
dreamy
she
was
mildly
intellectual
at
this
time
engaged
in
reading
marlowe
and
jonson
and
cowperwood
busy
in
the
matter
of
the
west
chicago
street
railway
and
conferring
with
her
father
was
conceived
by
her
as
a
great
personage
of
the
elizabethan
order
in
a
tentative
way
she
was
in
revolt
against
an
order
of
existence
which
was
being
forced
upon
her
cowperwood
recognized
the
mood
trifled
with
her
spiritedly
looked
into
her
eyes
and
found
the
response
he
wanted
neither
old
aymar
cochrane
nor
his
impeccably
respectable
wife
ever
discovered
subsequently
aileen
reflecting
upon
these
latest
developments
was
from
one
point
of
view
actually
pleased
or
eased
there
is
always
safety
in
numbers
and
she
felt
that
if
cowperwood
were
going
to
go
on
like
this
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
in
the
long
run
to
take
a
definite
interest
in
any
one
and
so
all
things
considered
and
other
things
being
equal
he
would
probably
just
as
leave
remain
married
to
her
as
not
but
what
a
comment
she
could
not
help
reflecting
on
her
own
charms
what
an
end
to
an
ideal
union
that
had
seemed
destined
to
last
all
their
days
she
aileen
butler
who
in
her
youth
had
deemed
herself
the
peer
of
any
girl
in
charm
force
beauty
to
be
shoved
aside
thus
early
in
her
life
she
was
only
forty
by
the
younger
generation
and
such
silly
snips
as
they
were
stephanie
platow
and
cecily
haguenin
and
florence
cochrane
in
all
likelihood
another
beginner
and
here
she
was
vigorous
resplendent
smooth
of
face
and
body
her
forehead
chin
neck
eyes
without
a
wrinkle
her
hair
a
rich
golden
reddish
glow
her
step
springing
her
weight
no
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
her
very
normal
height
with
all
the
advantages
of
a
complete
toilet
cabinet
jewels
clothing
taste
and
skill
in
material
selection
being
elbowed
out
by
these
upstarts
it
was
almost
unbelievable
it
was
so
unfair
life
was
so
cruel
cowperwood
so
temperamentally
unbalanced
dear
god
to
think
that
this
should
be
true
why
should
he
not
love
her
she
studied
her
beauty
in
the
mirror
from
time
to
time
and
raged
and
raged
why
was
her
body
not
sufficient
for
him
why
should
he
deem
any
one
more
beautiful
why
should
he
not
be
true
to
his
reiterated
protestations
that
he
cared
for
her
other
men
were
true
to
other
women
her
father
had
been
faithful
to
her
mother
at
the
thought
of
her
own
father
and
his
opinion
of
her
conduct
she
winced
but
it
did
not
change
her
point
of
view
as
to
her
present
rights
see
her
hair
see
her
eyes
see
her
smooth
resplendent
arms
why
should
cowperwood
not
love
her
why
indeed
one
night
shortly
afterward
she
was
sitting
in
her
boudoir
reading
waiting
for
him
to
come
home
when
the
sounded
and
he
informed
her
that
he
was
compelled
to
remain
at
the
office
late
afterward
he
said
he
might
be
obliged
to
run
on
to
pittsburg
for
hours
or
thereabouts
but
he
would
surely
be
back
on
the
third
day
counting
the
present
as
one
aileen
was
chagrined
her
voice
showed
it
they
had
been
scheduled
to
go
to
dinner
with
the
hoecksemas
and
afterward
to
the
theater
cowperwood
suggested
that
she
should
go
alone
but
aileen
declined
rather
sharply
she
hung
up
the
receiver
without
even
the
pretense
of
a
and
then
at
ten
he
telephoned
again
saying
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
that
if
she
were
interested
to
go
anywhere
a
later
supper
or
the
like
she
should
dress
otherwise
he
would
come
home
expecting
to
remain
aileen
immediately
concluded
that
some
scheme
he
had
had
to
amuse
himself
had
fallen
through
having
spoiled
her
evening
he
was
coming
home
to
make
as
much
hay
as
possible
out
of
this
bit
of
sunshine
this
infuriated
her
the
whole
business
of
uncertainty
in
the
matter
of
his
affections
was
telling
on
her
nerves
a
storm
was
in
order
and
it
had
come
he
came
bustling
in
a
little
later
slipped
his
arms
around
her
as
she
came
forward
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
he
smoothed
her
arms
in
a
and
yet
tender
way
and
patted
her
shoulders
seeing
her
frown
he
inquired
what
troubling
babykins
oh
nothing
more
than
usual
replied
aileen
irritably
let
not
talk
about
that
have
you
had
your
dinner
yes
we
had
it
brought
in
he
was
referring
to
mckenty
addison
and
himself
and
the
statement
was
true
being
in
an
honest
position
for
once
he
felt
called
upon
to
justify
himself
a
little
it
could
be
avoided
i
sorry
that
this
business
takes
up
so
much
of
my
time
but
i
get
out
of
it
some
day
soon
things
are
bound
to
ease
up
aileen
withdrew
from
his
embrace
and
went
to
her
a
glance
showed
her
that
her
hair
was
slightly
awry
and
she
smoothed
it
into
place
she
looked
at
her
chin
and
then
went
back
to
her
book
rather
sulkily
he
thought
now
aileen
what
the
trouble
he
inquired
are
you
glad
to
have
me
up
here
i
know
you
have
had
a
pretty
rough
road
of
it
of
late
but
are
you
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
trust
to
the
future
a
little
the
future
the
future
do
talk
to
me
about
the
future
little
enough
it
holds
in
store
for
me
she
replied
cowperwood
saw
that
she
was
verging
on
an
emotional
storm
but
he
trusted
to
his
powers
of
persuasion
and
her
basic
affection
for
him
to
soothe
and
quell
her
i
wish
you
would
act
this
way
pet
he
went
on
you
know
i
have
always
cared
for
you
you
know
i
always
shall
i
admit
that
there
are
a
lot
of
little
things
which
interfere
with
my
being
at
home
as
much
as
i
would
like
at
present
but
that
does
alter
the
fact
that
my
feeling
is
the
same
i
should
think
you
could
see
that
feeling
feeling
taunted
aileen
suddenly
yes
i
know
how
much
feeling
you
have
you
have
feeling
enough
to
give
other
women
sets
of
jade
and
jewels
and
to
run
around
with
every
silly
little
snip
you
meet
you
need
come
home
here
at
ten
when
you
ca
go
anywhere
else
and
talk
about
feeling
for
me
i
know
how
much
feeling
you
have
pshaw
she
flung
herself
irritably
back
in
her
chair
and
opened
her
book
cowperwood
gazed
at
her
solemnly
for
this
thrust
in
regard
to
stephanie
was
a
revelation
this
woman
business
could
grow
peculiarly
exasperating
at
times
what
do
you
mean
anyhow
he
observed
cautiously
and
with
much
seeming
candor
i
have
given
any
jade
or
jewels
to
any
one
nor
have
i
been
running
around
with
any
snips
as
you
call
them
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
aileen
oh
frank
commented
aileen
wearily
and
incredulously
you
lie
so
why
do
you
stand
there
and
lie
i
so
tired
of
it
i
so
sick
of
it
all
how
should
the
servants
know
of
so
many
things
to
talk
of
here
if
they
were
true
i
did
invite
platow
to
come
and
ask
me
why
you
had
given
her
daughter
a
set
of
jade
i
know
why
you
lie
you
want
to
hush
me
up
and
keep
quiet
you
afraid
i
go
to
haguenin
or
cochrane
or
platow
or
to
all
three
well
you
can
rest
your
soul
on
that
score
i
wo
i
sick
of
you
and
your
lies
stephanie
platow
the
thin
stick
cecily
haguenin
the
little
piece
of
gum
and
florence
cochrane
she
looks
like
a
dead
fish
aileen
had
a
genius
for
characterization
at
times
if
it
just
were
for
the
way
i
acted
toward
my
family
in
philadelphia
and
the
talk
it
would
create
and
the
injury
it
would
do
you
financially
i
act
leave
you
that
what
i
do
and
to
think
that
i
should
ever
have
believed
that
you
really
loved
me
or
could
care
for
any
woman
permanently
bosh
but
i
do
care
go
on
only
i
tell
you
one
thing
you
need
think
i
going
to
go
on
enduring
all
this
as
i
have
in
the
past
i
not
you
not
going
to
deceive
me
always
i
not
going
to
stand
it
i
not
so
old
yet
there
are
plenty
of
men
who
will
be
glad
to
pay
me
attention
if
you
wo
i
told
you
once
that
i
would
be
faithful
to
you
if
you
were
to
me
and
i
be
i
show
you
i
go
with
other
men
i
will
i
will
i
swear
it
aileen
he
asked
softly
pleadingly
realizing
the
futility
of
additional
lies
under
such
circumstances
wo
you
forgive
me
this
time
bear
with
me
for
the
present
i
scarcely
understand
myself
at
times
i
am
not
like
other
men
you
and
i
have
run
together
a
long
time
now
why
not
wait
awhile
give
me
a
chance
see
if
i
do
not
change
i
may
oh
yes
wait
change
you
may
change
have
i
waited
have
i
walked
the
floor
night
after
night
when
you
have
been
here
bear
with
you
yes
yes
who
to
bear
with
me
when
my
heart
is
breaking
oh
god
she
suddenly
added
with
passionate
vigor
i
miserable
i
miserable
my
heart
aches
it
aches
she
clutched
her
breast
and
swung
from
the
room
moving
with
that
vigorous
stride
that
had
once
appealed
to
him
so
and
still
did
alas
alas
it
touched
him
now
but
only
as
a
part
of
a
very
shifty
and
cruel
world
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
after
her
and
as
at
the
time
of
the
rita
sohlberg
incident
slipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
but
she
pulled
away
irritably
no
no
she
exclaimed
let
me
alone
tired
of
that
you
really
not
fair
to
me
aileen
with
a
great
show
of
feeling
and
sincerity
you
letting
one
affair
that
came
between
us
blind
your
whole
point
of
view
i
give
you
my
word
i
have
been
unfaithful
to
you
with
stephanie
platow
or
any
other
woman
i
may
have
flirted
with
them
a
little
but
that
is
really
nothing
why
not
be
sensible
i
not
as
black
as
you
paint
me
i
moving
in
big
matters
that
are
as
much
for
your
concern
and
future
as
for
mine
be
sensible
be
liberal
there
was
much
argument
the
usual
charges
and
countercharges
but
finally
because
of
her
weariness
of
heart
his
petting
the
unsolvability
of
it
all
she
permitted
him
for
the
time
being
to
persuade
her
that
there
were
still
some
crumbs
of
affection
left
she
was
heartsick
even
he
as
he
attempted
to
soothe
her
realized
clearly
that
to
establish
the
reality
of
his
love
in
her
belief
he
would
have
to
make
some
much
greater
effort
to
entertain
and
comfort
her
and
that
this
in
his
present
mood
and
with
his
leaning
toward
promiscuity
was
practically
impossible
for
the
time
being
a
peace
might
be
patched
up
but
in
view
of
what
she
expected
of
him
her
passion
and
selfish
individuality
it
could
not
be
he
would
have
to
go
on
and
she
would
have
to
leave
him
if
needs
be
but
he
could
not
cease
or
go
back
he
was
too
passionate
too
radiant
too
individual
and
complex
to
belong
to
any
one
single
individual
alone

obstacles
the
impediments
that
can
arise
to
baffle
a
great
and
swelling
career
are
strange
and
various
in
some
instances
all
the
of
life
must
be
cut
by
the
strong
swimmer
with
other
personalities
there
is
a
chance
or
force
that
happily
allies
itself
with
them
or
they
quite
unconsciously
ally
themselves
with
it
and
find
that
there
is
a
tide
that
bears
them
on
divine
will
not
necessarily
there
is
no
understanding
of
it
guardian
spirits
there
are
many
who
so
believe
to
their
utter
undoing
witness
macbeth
an
unconscious
drift
in
the
direction

right

duty
these
are
banners
of
mortal
manufacture
nothing
is
proved
all
is
permitted
not
long
after
cowperwood
accession
to
control
on
the
west
side
for
instance
a
contest
took
place
between
his
corporation
and
a
citizen
by
the
name
of
redmond
purdy
investor
and
which
set
chicago
by
the
ears
the
la
salle
and
washington
street
tunnels
were
now
in
active
service
but
because
of
the
great
north
and
south
area
of
the
west
side
necessitating
the
cabling
of
van
buren
street
and
blue
island
avenue
there
was
need
of
a
third
tunnel
somewhere
south
of
washington
street
preferably
at
van
buren
street
because
the
business
heart
was
thus
more
directly
reached
cowperwood
was
willing
and
anxious
to
build
this
tunnel
though
he
was
puzzled
how
to
secure
from
the
city
a
right
of
way
under
van
buren
street
where
a
bridge
loaded
with
heavy
traffic
now
swung
there
were
all
sorts
of
complications
in
the
first
place
the
consent
of
the
war
department
at
washington
had
to
be
secured
in
order
to
tunnel
under
the
river
at
all
secondly
the
excavation
if
directly
under
the
bridge
might
prove
an
intolerable
nuisance
necessitating
the
closing
or
removal
of
the
bridge
owing
to
the
critical
not
to
say
hostile
attitude
of
the
newspapers
which
since
the
la
salle
and
washington
tunnel
grants
were
following
his
every
move
with
a
searchlight
cowperwood
decided
not
to
petition
the
city
for
privileges
in
this
case
but
instead
to
buy
the
property
rights
of
sufficient
land
just
north
of
the
bridge
where
the
digging
of
the
tunnel
could
proceed
without
interference
the
piece
of
land
most
suitable
for
this
purpose
a
lot
x
lying
a
little
way
from
the

occupied
by
a

owned
by
the
previously
mentioned
redmond
purdy
a
long
thin
angular
dirty
person
who
wore
celluloid
collars
and
cuffs
and
spoke
with
a
nasal
intonation
cowperwood
had
the
customary
overtures
made
by
seemingly
disinterested
parties
endeavoring
to
secure
the
land
at
a
fair
price
but
purdy
who
was
as
stingy
as
a
miser
and
as
incisive
as
a
had
caught
wind
of
the
proposed
tunnel
scheme
he
was
all
alive
for
a
fine
profit
no
no
no
he
declared
over
and
over
when
approached
by
the
representatives
of
sylvester
toomey
cowperwood
ubiquitous
i
do
want
to
sell
go
away
sylvester
toomey
was
finally
at
his
wit
end
and
complained
to
cowperwood
who
at
once
sent
for
those
noble
beacons
of
dark
and
stormy
waters
general
van
sickle
and
the
hon
kent
barrows
mckibben
the
general
was
now
becoming
a
little
dolty
and
cowperwood
was
thinking
of
pensioning
him
but
mckibben
was
in
his
prime
smug
handsome
deadly
smooth
after
talking
it
over
with
toomey
they
returned
to
cowperwood
office
with
a
promising
scheme
the
hon
nahum
dickensheets
one
of
the
judges
of
the
state
court
of
appeals
and
a
man
long
since
attached
by
methods
which
need
not
here
be
described
to
cowperwood
star
had
been
persuaded
to
bring
his
extensive
technical
knowledge
to
bear
on
the
emergency
at
his
suggestion
the
work
of
digging
the
tunnel
was
at
once
begun
first
at
the
east
or
franklin
street
end
then
after
eight
months
digging
at
the
west
or
canal
street
end
a
shaft
was
actually
sunk
some
thirty
feet
back
of
purdy
building
between
it
and
the
river
while
that
gentleman
watched
with
a
quizzical
gleam
in
his
eye
this
defiant
procedure
he
was
sure
that
when
it
came
to
the
necessity
of
annexing
his
property
the
north
and
west
chicago
street
railways
would
be
obliged
to
pay
through
the
nose
well
i
be
cussed
he
frequently
observed
to
himself
for
he
could
not
see
how
his
exaction
of
a
pound
of
flesh
was
to
be
evaded
and
yet
he
felt
strangely
restless
at
times
finally
when
it
became
absolutely
necessary
for
cowperwood
to
secure
without
further
delay
this
coveted
strip
he
sent
for
its
occupant
who
called
in
pleasant
anticipation
of
a
profitable
conversation
this
should
be
worth
a
small
fortune
to
him
purdy
observed
cowperwood
glibly
you
have
a
piece
of
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
that
i
need
why
do
you
sell
it
to
me
ca
we
fix
this
up
now
in
some
amicable
way
he
smiled
while
purdy
cast
shrewd
wolfish
glances
about
the
place
wondering
how
much
he
could
really
hope
to
exact
the
building
with
all
its
interior
equipment
land
and
all
was
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
why
should
i
sell
the
building
is
a
good
building
it
as
useful
to
me
as
it
would
be
to
you
i
making
money
out
of
it
quite
true
replied
cowperwood
but
i
am
willing
to
pay
you
a
fair
price
for
it
a
public
utility
is
involved
this
tunnel
will
be
a
good
thing
for
the
west
side
and
any
other
land
you
may
own
over
there
with
what
i
will
pay
you
you
can
buy
more
land
in
that
neighborhood
or
elsewhere
and
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
we
need
to
put
this
tunnel
just
where
it
is
or
i
would
trouble
to
argue
with
you
that
just
it
replied
purdy
fixedly
you
gone
ahead
and
dug
your
tunnel
without
consulting
me
and
now
you
expect
me
to
get
out
of
the
way
well
i
do
see
that
i
called
on
to
get
out
of
there
just
to
please
you
but
i
pay
you
a
fair
price
how
much
will
you
pay
me
how
much
do
you
want
purdy
scratched
a
ear
one
million
dollars
one
million
dollars
exclaimed
cowperwood
do
you
think
that
a
little
steep
mr
purdy
no
replied
purdy
sagely
it
not
any
more
than
it
worth
cowperwood
sighed
i
sorry
he
replied
meditatively
but
this
is
really
too
much
would
you
take
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cash
now
and
consider
this
thing
closed
one
million
replied
purdy
looking
sternly
at
the
ceiling
very
well
purdy
replied
cowperwood
i
very
sorry
it
plain
to
me
that
we
ca
do
business
as
i
had
hoped
i
willing
to
pay
you
a
reasonable
sum
but
what
you
ask
is
far
too
much
preposterous
you
think
you
better
reconsider
we
might
move
the
tunnel
even
yet
one
million
dollars
said
purdy
it
ca
be
done
purdy
it
is
worth
it
why
wo
you
be
fair
call
it
three
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
cash
and
my
check
i
would
take
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
if
you
were
to
offer
it
to
me
cowperwood
or
any
other
time
i
know
my
rights
very
well
then
replied
cowperwood
that
all
i
can
say
if
you
wo
sell
you
wo
sell
perhaps
you
change
your
mind
later
purdy
went
out
and
cowperwood
called
in
his
lawyers
and
his
engineers
one
saturday
afternoon
a
week
or
two
later
when
the
building
in
question
had
been
vacated
for
the
day
a
company
of
three
hundred
laborers
with
wagons
picks
shovels
and
dynamite
sticks
arrived
by
sundown
of
the
next
day
which
being
sunday
was
a
legal
holiday
with
no
courts
open
or
sitting
to
issue
injunctions
this
comely
structure
the
private
property
of
redmond
purdy
was
completely
razed
and
a
large
excavation
substituted
in
its
stead
the
gentleman
of
the
celluloid
cuffs
and
collars
when
informed
about
nine
of
this
same
sunday
morning
that
his
building
had
been
almost
completely
removed
was
naturally
greatly
perturbed
a
portion
of
the
wall
was
still
standing
when
he
arrived
hot
and
excited
and
the
police
were
appealed
to
but
strange
to
say
this
was
of
little
avail
for
they
were
shown
a
writ
of
injunction
issued
by
the
court
of
highest
jurisdiction
presided
over
by
the
hon
nahum
dickensheets
which
restrained
all
and
sundry
from
interfering
subsequently
on
demand
of
another
court
this
remarkable
document
was
discovered
to
have
disappeared
the
contention
was
that
it
had
never
really
existed
or
been
produced
at
all
the
demolition
and
digging
proceeded
then
began
a
scurrying
of
lawyers
to
the
door
of
one
friendly
judge
after
another
there
were
apoplectic
cheeks
blazing
eyes
and
gasps
for
breath
while
the
enormity
of
the
offense
was
being
noised
abroad
law
is
law
however
procedure
is
procedure
and
no
writ
of
injunction
was
either
issuable
or
returnable
on
a
legal
holiday
when
no
courts
were
sitting
nevertheless
by
three
in
the
afternoon
an
obliging
magistrate
was
found
who
consented
to
issue
an
injunction
staying
this
terrible
crime
by
this
time
however
the
building
was
gone
the
excavation
complete
it
remained
merely
for
the
west
chicago
street
railway
company
to
secure
an
injunction
vacating
the
first
injunction
praying
that
its
rights
privileges
liberties
be
not
interfered
with
and
so
creating
a
contest
which
naturally
threw
the
matter
into
the
state
court
of
appeals
where
it
could
safely
lie
for
several
years
there
were
numberless
injunctions
writs
of
errors
doubts
motions
to
reconsider
threats
to
carry
the
matter
from
the
state
to
the
federal
courts
on
a
matter
of
constitutional
privilege
and
the
like
the
affair
was
finally
settled
out
of
court
for
purdy
by
this
time
was
a
more
sensible
man
in
the
mean
time
however
the
newspapers
had
been
given
full
details
of
the
transaction
and
a
storm
of
words
against
cowperwood
ensued
but
more
disturbing
than
the
redmond
purdy
incident
was
the
rivalry
of
a
new
chicago
company
it
appeared
first
as
an
idea
in
the
brain
of
one
james
furnivale
woolsen
a
determined
young
westerner
from
california
and
developed
by
degrees
into
consents
and
petitions
from
fully
of
the
residents
of
various
streets
in
the
extreme
southwest
section
of
the
city
where
it
was
proposed
the
new
line
should
be
located
this
same
james
furnivale
woolsen
being
an
ambitious
person
was
not
to
be
so
easily
put
down
besides
the
consent
and
petitions
which
cowperwood
could
not
easily
get
away
from
him
he
had
a
new
form
of
traction
then
being
tried
out
in
several
minor
cities
a
form
of
electric
propulsion
by
means
of
an
overhead
wire
and
a
traveling
pole
which
was
said
to
be
very
economical
and
to
give
a
service
better
than
cables
and
cheaper
even
than
horses
cowperwood
had
heard
all
about
this
new
electric
system
some
time
before
and
had
been
studying
it
for
several
years
with
the
greatest
interest
since
it
promised
to
revolutionize
the
whole
business
of
however
having
but
so
recently
completed
his
excellent
cable
system
he
did
not
see
that
it
was
advisable
to
throw
it
away
the
trolley
was
as
yet
too
much
of
a
novelty
certainly
it
was
not
advisable
to
have
it
introduced
into
chicago
until
he
was
ready
to
introduce
it
himself
first
on
his
outlying
feeder
lines
he
thought
then
perhaps
generally
but
before
he
could
take
suitable
action
against
woolsen
that
engaging
young
upstart
who
was
possessed
of
a
imagination
and
a
gift
of
gab
had
allied
himself
with
such
interested
investors
as
truman
leslie
macdonald
who
saw
here
a
opportunity
of
mulcting
cowperwood
and
jordan
jules
once
the
president
of
the
north
chicago
gas
company
who
had
lost
money
through
cowperwood
in
the
gas
war
two
better
instruments
for
goading
a
man
whom
they
considered
an
enemy
could
not
well
be
imagined
truman
leslie
with
his
dark
waspish
mistrustful
jealous
eyes
and
his
slim
vital
body
and
jordan
jules
short
rotund
sandy
a
sickly
crop
of
thin
oily
light
hair
growing
down
over
his
his
forehead
and
crown
glisteningly
bald
his
eyes
a
seeking
searching
revengeful
blue
they
in
turn
brought
in
samuel
blackman
once
president
of
the
south
side
gas
company
sunderland
sledd
of
local
railroad
management
and
fame
and
norrie
simms
president
of
the
douglas
trust
company
who
however
was
little
more
than
a
fiscal
agent
the
general
feeling
was
that
cowperwood
defensive
tactics
which
consisted
in
having
the
city
council
refuse
to
act
could
be
easily
met
well
i
think
we
can
soon
fix
that
exclaimed
young
macdonald
one
morning
at
a
meeting
we
ought
to
be
able
to
smoke
them
out
a
little
publicity
will
do
it
he
appealed
to
his
father
the
editor
of
the
inquirer
but
the
latter
refused
to
act
for
the
time
being
seeing
that
his
son
was
interested
macdonald
enraged
at
the
attitude
of
the
council
invaded
that
body
and
demanded
of
alderman
dowling
still
leader
why
this
matter
of
the
chicago
general
ordinances
was
still
lying
unconsidered
dowling
a
large
mushy
placid
man
with
blue
eyes
an
iron
frame
and
a
beefy
smile
vouchsafed
the
information
that
although
he
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
streets
and
alleys
he
knew
nothing
about
it
i
have
been
payin
much
attention
to
things
lately
he
replied
macdonald
went
to
see
the
remaining
members
of
this
same
committee
they
were
they
would
have
to
look
into
the
matter
somebody
claimed
that
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
petitions
evidently
there
was
crooked
work
here
somewhere
cowperwood
was
to
blame
no
doubt
macdonald
conferred
with
blackman
and
jordan
jules
and
it
was
determined
that
the
council
should
be
harried
into
doing
its
duty
this
was
a
legitimate
enterprise
a
new
and
better
system
of
traction
was
being
kept
out
of
the
city
schryhart
since
he
was
offered
an
interest
and
since
there
was
considerable
chance
of
his
being
able
to
dominate
the
new
enterprise
agreed
that
the
ordinances
ought
to
be
acted
upon
in
consequence
there
was
a
renewed
hubbub
in
the
newspapers
it
was
pointed
out
through
schryhart
chronicle
through
hyssop
and
merrill
papers
and
through
the
inquirer
that
such
a
situation
was
intolerable
if
the
dominant
party
at
the
behest
of
so
sinister
an
influence
as
cowperwood
was
to
tie
up
all
outside
traction
legislation
there
could
be
but
one
thing
left
an
appeal
to
the
voters
of
the
city
to
turn
the
rascals
out
no
party
could
survive
such
a
record
of
political
trickery
and
financial
jugglery
mckenty
dowling
cowperwood
and
others
were
characterized
as
unreasonable
obstructionists
and
debasing
influences
but
cowperwood
merely
smiled
these
were
the
caterwaulings
of
the
enemy
later
when
young
macdonald
threatened
to
bring
legal
action
to
compel
the
council
to
do
its
duty
cowperwood
and
his
associates
were
not
so
cheerful
a
mandamus
proceeding
however
futile
would
give
the
newspapers
great
opportunity
for
chatter
moreover
a
city
election
was
drawing
near
however
mckenty
and
cowperwood
were
by
no
means
helpless
they
had
offices
jobs
funds
a
party
system
the
saloons
the
dives
and
those
dark
chambers
where
at
late
hours
are
incontinently
stuffed
did
cowperwood
share
personally
in
all
this
not
at
all
or
mckenty
no
in
good
tweed
and
fine
linen
they
frequently
conferred
in
the
offices
of
the
chicago
trust
company
the
president
office
of
the
north
chicago
street
railway
system
and
cowperwood
library
no
dark
scenes
were
ever
enacted
there
but
just
the
same
when
the
time
came
the
editorial
combination
did
not
win
mckenty
party
had
the
votes
a
number
of
the
most
flagrantly
debauched
aldermen
it
is
true
were
defeated
but
what
is
an
alderman
here
and
there
the
newly
elected
ones
even
in
the
face
of
promises
and
vows
could
be
easily
suborned
or
convinced
so
the
element
was
just
where
it
was
before
but
the
feeling
against
him
was
much
stronger
and
considerable
sentiment
generated
in
the
public
at
large
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
cowperwood
method
of
control
chapter
xxxi
untoward
disclosures
coincident
with
these
public
disturbances
and
of
subsequent
hearing
upon
them
was
the
discovery
by
editor
haguenin
of
relationship
with
cecily
it
came
about
not
through
aileen
who
was
no
longer
willing
to
fight
cowperwood
in
this
matter
but
through
haguenin
lady
society
editor
who
hearing
rumors
in
the
social
world
springing
from
heaven
knows
where
and
being
beholden
to
haguenin
for
many
favors
had
carried
the
matter
to
him
in
a
very
direct
way
haguenin
a
man
of
insufficient
worldliness
in
spite
of
his
journalistic
profession
scarcely
believed
it
cowperwood
was
so
suave
so
commercial
he
had
heard
many
things
concerning
him
his
past
but
cowperwood
present
state
in
chicago
was
such
it
seemed
to
him
as
to
preclude
petty
affairs
of
this
kind
still
the
name
of
his
daughter
being
involved
he
took
the
matter
up
with
cecily
who
under
pressure
confessed
she
made
the
usual
plea
that
she
was
of
age
and
that
she
wished
to
live
her
own
life
logic
which
she
had
gathered
largely
from
cowperwood
attitude
haguenin
did
nothing
about
it
at
first
thinking
to
send
cecily
off
to
an
aunt
in
nebraska
but
finding
her
intractable
and
fearing
some
or
reprisal
on
the
part
of
cowperwood
who
by
the
way
had
indorsed
paper
to
the
extent
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
him
he
decided
to
discuss
matters
first
it
meant
a
cessation
of
relations
and
some
inconvenient
financial
readjustments
but
it
had
to
be
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
calling
on
cowperwood
when
the
latter
unaware
as
yet
of
the
latest
development
in
regard
to
cecily
and
having
some
variation
of
his
council
programme
to
discuss
with
haguenin
asked
him
over
the
to
lunch
haguenin
was
much
surprised
but
in
a
way
relieved
i
am
busy
he
said
very
heavily
but
can
not
you
come
to
the
office
some
time
there
is
something
i
would
like
to
see
you
about
cowperwood
imagining
that
there
was
some
editorial
or
local
political
development
on
foot
which
might
be
of
interest
to
him
made
an
appointment
for
shortly
after
four
he
drove
to
the
publisher
office
in
the
press
building
and
was
greeted
by
a
grave
and
almost
despondent
man
cowperwood
began
haguenin
when
the
financier
entered
smart
and
trig
his
usual
air
of
genial
sufficiency
written
all
over
him
i
have
known
you
now
for
something
like
fourteen
years
and
during
this
time
i
have
shown
you
nothing
but
courtesy
and
good
will
it
is
true
that
quite
recently
you
have
done
me
various
financial
favors
but
that
was
more
due
i
thought
to
the
sincere
friendship
you
bore
me
than
to
anything
else
quite
accidentally
i
have
learned
of
the
relationship
that
exists
between
you
and
my
daughter
i
have
recently
spoken
to
her
and
she
admitted
all
that
i
need
to
know
common
decency
it
seems
to
me
might
have
suggested
to
you
that
you
leave
my
child
out
of
the
list
of
women
you
have
degraded
since
it
has
not
i
merely
wish
to
say
to
you
and
haguenin
face
was
very
tense
and
white
that
the
relationship
between
you
and
me
is
ended
the
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
have
indorsed
for
me
will
be
arranged
for
otherwise
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
hope
you
will
return
to
me
the
stock
of
this
paper
that
you
hold
as
collateral
another
type
of
man
cowperwood
might
attempt
to
make
you
suffer
in
another
way
i
presume
that
you
have
no
children
of
your
own
or
that
if
you
have
you
lack
the
parental
instinct
otherwise
you
could
not
have
injured
me
in
this
fashion
i
believe
that
you
will
live
to
see
that
this
policy
does
not
pay
in
chicago
or
anywhere
else
haguenin
turned
slowly
on
his
heel
toward
his
desk
cowperwood
who
had
listened
very
patiently
and
very
fixedly
without
a
tremor
of
an
eyelash
merely
said
there
seems
to
be
no
common
intellectual
ground
haguenin
upon
which
you
and
i
can
meet
in
this
matter
you
can
not
understand
my
point
of
view
i
could
not
possibly
adopt
yours
however
as
you
wish
it
the
stock
will
be
returned
to
you
upon
receipt
of
my
indorsements
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
he
turned
and
walked
unconcernedly
out
thinking
that
it
was
too
bad
to
lose
the
support
of
so
respectable
a
man
but
also
that
he
could
do
without
it
it
was
silly
the
way
parents
insisted
on
their
daughters
being
something
that
they
did
not
wish
to
be
haguenin
stood
by
his
desk
after
cowperwood
had
gone
wondering
where
he
should
get
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
quickly
and
also
what
he
should
do
to
make
his
daughter
see
the
error
of
her
ways
it
was
an
astonishing
blow
he
had
received
he
thought
in
the
house
of
a
friend
it
occurred
to
him
that
walter
melville
hyssop
who
was
succeeding
mightily
with
his
two
papers
might
come
to
his
rescue
and
that
later
he
could
repay
him
when
the
press
was
more
prosperous
he
went
out
to
his
house
in
a
quandary
concerning
life
and
chance
while
cowperwood
went
to
the
chicago
trust
company
to
confer
with
videra
and
later
out
to
his
own
home
to
consider
how
he
should
equalize
this
loss
the
state
and
fate
of
cecily
haguenin
was
not
of
so
much
importance
as
many
other
things
on
his
mind
at
this
time
far
more
serious
were
his
cogitations
with
regard
to
a
liaison
he
had
recently
ventured
to
establish
with
hosmer
hand
wife
of
an
eminent
investor
and
financier
hand
was
a
solid
phlegmatic
person
who
had
some
years
before
lost
his
first
wife
to
whom
he
had
been
eminently
faithful
after
that
for
a
period
of
years
he
had
been
a
lonely
speculator
attending
to
his
vast
affairs
but
finally
because
of
his
enormous
wealth
his
rather
presentable
appearance
and
social
rank
he
had
been
entrapped
by
much
social
attention
on
the
part
of
a
jessie
drew
barrett
into
marrying
her
daughter
caroline
a
dashing
skip
of
a
girl
who
was
clever
incisive
calculating
and
intensely
gay
since
she
was
socially
ambitious
and
without
much
heart
the
thought
of
hand
millions
and
how
advantageous
would
be
her
situation
in
case
he
should
die
had
enabled
her
to
overlook
quite
easily
his
heavy
unyouthful
appearance
and
to
see
him
in
the
light
of
a
lover
there
was
criticism
of
course
hand
was
considered
a
victim
and
caroline
and
her
mother
designing
minxes
and
cats
but
since
the
wealthy
financier
was
truly
ensnared
it
behooved
friends
and
future
satellites
to
be
courteous
and
so
they
were
the
wedding
was
very
well
attended
hand
began
to
give
teas
musicales
and
receptions
on
a
lavish
scale
cowperwood
never
met
either
her
or
her
husband
until
he
was
well
launched
on
his
programme
needing
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
a
hurry
and
finding
the
chicago
trust
company
the
lake
city
bank
and
other
institutions
heavily
loaded
with
his
securities
he
turned
in
a
moment
of
inspirational
thought
to
hand
cowperwood
was
always
a
great
borrower
his
paper
was
out
in
large
quantities
he
introduced
himself
frequently
to
powerful
men
in
this
way
taking
long
or
short
loans
at
high
or
low
rates
of
interest
as
the
case
might
be
and
sometimes
finding
some
one
whom
he
could
work
with
or
use
in
the
case
of
hand
though
the
latter
was
ostensibly
of
the
enemies
camp
the
crowd
nevertheless
cowperwood
had
no
hesitation
in
going
to
him
he
wished
to
overcome
or
forestall
any
unfavorable
impression
though
hand
a
solemn
man
of
shrewd
but
honest
nature
had
heard
a
number
of
unfavorable
rumors
he
was
inclined
to
be
fair
and
think
the
best
perhaps
cowperwood
was
merely
the
victim
of
envious
rivals
when
the
latter
first
called
on
him
at
his
office
in
the
rookery
building
he
was
most
cordial
come
in
cowperwood
he
said
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
from
one
person
and
another
mostly
from
the
newspapers
what
can
i
do
for
you
cowperwood
exhibited
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
west
chicago
street
railway
stock
i
want
to
know
if
i
can
get
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
those
by
morning
hand
a
placid
man
looked
at
the
securities
peacefully
what
the
matter
with
your
own
bank
he
was
referring
to
the
chicago
trust
company
ca
it
take
care
of
them
for
you
loaded
up
with
other
things
just
now
smiled
cowperwood
ingratiatingly
well
if
i
can
believe
all
the
papers
say
you
going
to
wreck
these
roads
or
chicago
or
yourself
but
i
do
live
by
the
papers
how
long
would
you
want
it
for
six
months
perhaps
a
year
if
you
choose
hand
turned
over
the
securities
eying
their
gold
seals
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
six
per
cent
west
chicago
preferred
he
commented
are
you
earning
six
per
we
earning
eight
right
now
you
live
to
see
the
day
when
these
shares
will
sell
at
two
hundred
dollars
and
pay
twelve
per
cent
at
that
and
you
quadrupled
the
issue
of
the
old
company
well
growing
leave
them
here
until
or
bring
them
back
send
over
or
call
me
and
i
tell
you
they
talked
for
a
little
while
on
and
corporation
matters
hand
wanted
to
know
something
concerning
west
chicago
land
a
region
adjoining
ravenswood
cowperwood
gave
him
his
best
advice
the
next
day
he
and
the
stocks
so
hand
informed
him
were
available
he
would
send
a
check
over
so
thus
a
tentative
friendship
began
and
it
lasted
until
the
relationship
between
cowperwood
and
hand
was
consummated
and
discovered
in
caroline
barrett
as
she
occasionally
preferred
to
sign
herself
cowperwood
encountered
a
woman
who
was
as
restless
and
fickle
as
himself
but
not
so
shrewd
socially
ambitious
she
was
anything
but
socially
conventional
and
she
did
not
care
for
hand
once
married
she
had
planned
to
repay
herself
in
part
by
a
very
gay
existence
the
affair
between
her
and
cowperwood
had
begun
at
a
dinner
at
the
magnificent
residence
of
hand
on
the
north
shore
drive
overlooking
the
lake
cowperwood
had
gone
to
talk
over
with
her
husband
various
chicago
matters
hand
was
excited
by
his
risque
reputation
a
little
woman
in
stature
with
intensely
white
teeth
red
lips
which
she
did
not
hesitate
to
rouge
on
occasion
brown
hair
and
small
brown
eyes
which
had
a
gay
searching
defiant
twinkle
in
them
she
did
her
best
to
be
interesting
clever
witty
and
she
was
i
know
frank
cowperwood
by
reputation
anyhow
she
exclaimed
holding
out
a
small
white
jeweled
hand
the
nails
of
which
at
their
juncture
with
the
flesh
were
tinged
with
henna
and
the
palms
of
which
were
slightly
rouged
her
eyes
blazed
and
her
teeth
gleamed
one
can
scarcely
read
of
anything
else
in
the
chicago
papers
cowperwood
returned
his
most
winning
beam
i
delighted
to
meet
you
hand
i
have
read
of
you
too
but
i
hope
you
do
believe
all
the
papers
say
about
me
and
if
i
did
it
would
hurt
you
in
my
estimation
to
do
is
to
be
talked
about
in
these
days
cowperwood
because
of
his
desire
to
employ
the
services
of
hand
was
at
his
best
he
kept
the
conversation
within
conventional
lines
but
all
the
while
he
was
exchanging
secret
unobserved
smiles
with
hand
whom
he
realized
at
once
had
married
hand
for
his
money
and
was
bent
under
a
somewhat
jealous
espionage
to
have
a
good
time
anyhow
there
is
a
kind
of
eagerness
that
goes
with
those
who
are
watched
and
wish
to
escape
that
gives
them
a
gay
electric
awareness
and
sparkle
in
the
presence
of
an
opportunity
for
release
hand
had
this
cowperwood
a
past
master
in
this
matter
of
femininity
studied
her
hands
her
hair
her
eyes
her
smile
after
some
contemplation
he
decided
other
things
being
equal
that
hand
would
do
and
that
he
could
be
interested
if
she
were
very
much
interested
in
him
her
telling
eyes
and
smiles
the
heightened
color
of
her
cheeks
indicated
after
a
time
that
she
was
meeting
him
on
the
street
one
day
not
long
after
they
had
first
met
she
told
him
that
she
was
going
for
a
visit
to
friends
at
oconomowoc
in
wisconsin
i
do
suppose
you
ever
get
up
that
far
north
in
summer
do
you
she
asked
with
an
air
and
smiled
i
never
have
he
replied
but
there
no
telling
what
i
might
do
if
i
were
bantered
i
suppose
you
ride
and
canoe
oh
yes
and
play
tennis
and
golf
too
but
where
would
a
mere
idler
like
me
stay
oh
there
are
several
good
hotels
there
never
any
trouble
about
that
i
suppose
you
ride
yourself
after
a
fashion
replied
cowperwood
who
was
an
expert
witness
then
the
casual
encounter
on
horseback
early
one
sunday
morning
in
the
painted
hills
of
wisconsin
of
frank
algernon
cowperwood
and
caroline
hand
a
jaunty
racing
canter
side
by
side
idle
talk
concerning
people
scenery
conveniences
his
usual
direct
suggestions
and
and
then
subsequently
the
day
of
reckoning
if
such
it
might
be
called
came
later
caroline
hand
was
perhaps
unduly
reckless
she
admired
cowperwood
greatly
without
really
loving
him
he
found
her
interesting
principally
because
she
was
young
debonair
sufficient
a
new
type
they
met
in
chicago
after
a
time
instead
of
in
wisconsin
then
in
detroit
where
she
had
friends
then
in
rockford
where
a
sister
had
gone
to
live
it
was
easy
for
him
with
his
time
and
means
finally
duane
kingsland
wholesale
flour
merchant
religious
moral
conventional
who
knew
cowperwood
and
his
repute
encountered
hand
and
cowperwood
first
near
oconomowoc
one
summer
day
and
later
in
randolph
street
near
cowperwood
bachelor
rooms
being
the
man
that
he
was
and
knowing
old
hand
well
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
ask
the
latter
if
his
wife
knew
cowperwood
intimately
there
was
an
explosion
in
the
hand
home
hand
when
confronted
by
her
husband
denied
of
course
that
there
was
anything
wrong
between
her
and
cowperwood
her
elderly
husband
from
a
certain
telltale
excitement
and
resentment
in
her
manner
did
not
believe
this
he
thought
once
of
confronting
cowperwood
but
being
heavy
and
practical
he
finally
decided
to
sever
all
business
relationships
with
him
and
fight
him
in
other
ways
hand
was
watched
very
closely
and
a
suborned
maid
discovered
an
old
note
she
had
written
to
cowperwood
an
attempt
to
persuade
her
to
leave
for
europe
as
old
butler
had
once
attempted
to
send
aileen
years
before
raised
a
storm
of
protest
but
she
went
hand
from
being
neutral
if
not
friendly
became
quite
the
most
dangerous
and
forceful
of
all
cowperwood
chicago
enemies
he
was
a
powerful
man
his
wrath
was
boundless
he
looked
upon
cowperwood
now
as
a
dark
and
dangerous
man
one
of
whom
chicago
would
be
well
rid
chapter
xxxii
a
supper
party
since
the
days
in
which
aileen
had
been
left
more
or
less
lonely
by
cowperwood
however
no
two
individuals
had
been
more
faithful
in
their
attentions
than
taylor
lord
and
kent
mckibben
both
were
fond
of
her
in
a
general
way
finding
her
interesting
physically
and
temperamentally
but
being
beholden
to
the
magnate
for
many
favors
they
were
exceedingly
circumspect
in
their
attitude
toward
her
particularly
during
those
early
years
in
which
they
knew
that
cowperwood
was
intensely
devoted
to
her
later
they
were
not
so
careful
it
was
during
this
latter
period
that
aileen
came
gradually
through
the
agency
of
these
two
men
to
share
in
a
form
of
life
that
was
not
utterly
dull
in
every
large
city
there
is
a
kind
of
social
half
world
where
artists
and
the
more
adventurous
of
the
socially
unconventional
and
restless
meet
for
an
exchange
of
things
which
can
not
be
counted
mere
social
form
and
civility
it
is
the
world
of
bohemia
hither
resort
those
accidentals
of
fancy
that
make
the
stage
the
and
all
the
schools
of
artistic
endeavor
interesting
or
peculiar
in
a
number
of
studios
in
chicago
such
as
those
of
lane
cross
and
rhees
crier
such
little
circles
were
to
be
found
rhees
crier
for
instance
a
purely
parlor
artist
with
all
the
airs
conventions
and
social
adaptability
of
the
tribe
had
quite
a
following
here
and
to
several
other
places
by
turns
taylor
lord
and
kent
mckibben
conducted
aileen
both
asking
and
obtaining
permission
to
be
civil
to
her
when
cowperwood
was
away
among
the
friends
of
these
two
at
this
time
was
a
certain
polk
lynde
an
interesting
society
figure
whose
father
owned
an
immense
reaper
works
and
whose
time
was
spent
in
idling
racing
gambling
socializing
anything
in
short
that
it
came
into
his
head
to
do
he
was
tall
dark
athletic
straight
muscular
with
a
small
dark
mustache
dark
eyes
kinky
black
hair
and
a
fine
almost
military
carriage
which
he
clothed
always
to
the
best
advantage
a
clever
philanderer
it
was
quite
his
pride
that
he
did
not
boast
of
his
conquests
one
look
at
him
however
by
the
initiated
and
the
story
was
told
aileen
first
saw
him
on
a
visit
to
the
studio
of
rhees
grier
being
introduced
to
him
very
casually
on
this
occasion
she
was
nevertheless
clearly
conscious
that
she
was
encountering
a
fascinating
man
and
that
he
was
fixing
her
with
a
warm
avid
eye
for
the
moment
she
recoiled
from
him
as
being
a
little
too
brazen
in
his
stare
and
yet
she
admired
the
general
appearance
of
him
he
was
of
that
smart
world
that
she
admired
so
much
and
from
which
now
apparently
she
was
hopelessly
debarred
that
trig
bold
air
of
his
realized
for
her
at
last
the
type
of
man
outside
of
cowperwood
whom
she
would
prefer
within
limits
to
admire
her
if
she
were
going
to
be
bad
as
she
would
have
phrased
it
to
herself
she
would
be
bad
with
a
man
such
as
he
he
would
be
winsome
and
coaxing
but
at
the
same
time
strong
direct
deliciously
brutal
like
her
frank
he
had
too
what
cowperwood
could
not
have
a
certain
social
air
or
swagger
which
came
with
idleness
much
loafing
a
sense
of
social
superiority
and
security
a
insouciance
which
recks
little
of
other
people
will
or
whims
when
she
next
saw
him
which
was
several
weeks
later
at
an
affair
of
the
courtney
tabors
friends
of
lord
he
exclaimed
oh
yes
by
george
you
the
cowperwood
i
met
several
weeks
ago
at
rhees
grier
studio
i
not
forgotten
you
i
seen
you
in
my
eye
all
over
chicago
taylor
lord
introduced
me
to
you
say
but
you
a
beautiful
woman
he
leaned
ingratiatingly
whimsically
admiringly
near
aileen
realized
that
for
so
early
in
the
afternoon
and
considering
the
crowd
he
was
curiously
enthusiastic
the
truth
was
that
because
of
some
rounds
he
had
made
elsewhere
he
was
verging
toward
too
much
liquor
his
eye
was
alight
his
color
coppery
his
air
swagger
bacchanal
this
made
her
a
little
cautious
but
she
rather
liked
his
brown
hard
face
handsome
mouth
and
crisp
jovian
curls
his
compliment
was
not
utterly
improper
but
she
nevertheless
attempted
coyly
to
avoid
him
come
polk
here
an
old
friend
of
yours
over
here
sadie
boutwell
she
wants
to
meet
you
again
some
one
observed
catching
him
by
the
arm
no
you
do
he
exclaimed
genially
and
yet
at
the
same
time
a
little
resentfully
the
kind
of
disjointed
resentment
a
man
who
has
had
the
least
bit
too
much
is
apt
to
feel
on
being
interrupted
i
not
going
to
walk
all
over
chicago
thinking
of
a
woman
i
seen
somewhere
only
to
be
carried
away
the
first
time
i
do
meet
her
i
going
to
talk
to
her
first
aileen
laughed
it
charming
of
you
but
we
can
meet
again
perhaps
besides
there
some
one
here
lord
was
tactfully
directing
her
attention
to
another
woman
rhees
grier
and
mckibben
who
were
present
also
came
to
her
assistance
in
the
hubbub
that
ensued
aileen
was
temporarily
extricated
and
lynde
tactfully
steered
out
of
her
way
but
they
had
met
again
and
it
was
not
to
be
the
last
time
subsequent
to
this
second
meeting
lynde
thought
the
matter
over
quite
calmly
and
decided
that
he
must
make
a
definite
effort
to
become
more
intimate
with
aileen
though
she
was
not
as
young
as
some
others
she
suited
his
present
mood
exactly
she
was
rich
physically
voluptuous
and
sentient
she
was
not
of
his
world
precisely
but
what
of
it
she
was
the
wife
of
an
eminent
financier
who
had
been
in
society
once
and
she
herself
had
a
dramatic
record
he
was
sure
of
that
he
could
win
her
if
he
wanted
to
it
would
be
easy
knowing
her
as
he
did
and
knowing
what
he
did
about
her
so
not
long
after
lynde
ventured
to
invite
her
with
lord
mckibben
and
rhees
grier
and
a
young
girl
friend
of
grier
who
was
rather
attractive
a
miss
chrystobel
lanman
to
a
theater
and
supper
party
the
programme
was
to
hear
a
reigning
farce
at
hooley
then
to
sup
at
the
richelieu
and
finally
to
visit
a
certain
exclusive
which
then
flourished
on
the
south
side
the
resort
of
actors
society
gamblers
and
the
like
where
roulette
baccarat
and
the
honest
game
of
poker
to
say
nothing
of
various
other
games
of
chance
could
be
played
amid
exceedingly
recherche
surroundings
the
party
was
gay
especially
after
the
adjournment
to
the
richelieu
where
special
dishes
of
chicken
lobster
and
a
bucket
of
champagne
were
served
later
at
the
alcott
club
as
the
gambling
resort
was
known
aileen
according
to
lynde
was
to
be
taught
to
play
baccarat
poker
and
any
other
game
that
she
wished
you
follow
my
advice
cowperwood
he
observed
cheerfully
at
dinner
being
host
he
had
put
her
between
himself
and
mckibben
and
i
show
you
how
to
get
your
money
back
anyhow
that
more
than
some
others
can
do
he
added
spiritedly
recalling
by
a
look
a
recent
occasion
when
he
and
mckibben
being
out
with
friends
the
latter
had
advised
liberally
and
had
seen
his
advice
go
wrong
have
you
been
gambling
kent
asked
aileen
archly
turning
to
her
social
mentor
and
friend
no
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
replied
mckibben
with
a
bland
smile
i
may
have
thought
i
was
gambling
but
i
admit
i
do
know
how
now
polk
here
wins
all
the
time
do
you
polk
just
follow
him
a
wry
smile
spread
over
lynde
face
at
this
for
it
was
on
record
in
certain
circles
that
he
had
lost
as
much
as
ten
and
even
fifteen
thousand
in
an
evening
he
also
had
a
record
of
winning
thousand
once
at
baccarat
at
an
and
sitting
and
then
losing
it
lynde
all
through
the
evening
had
been
casting
hard
meaning
glances
into
aileen
eyes
she
could
not
avoid
this
and
she
did
not
feel
that
she
wanted
to
he
was
so
charming
he
was
talking
to
her
half
the
time
at
the
theater
without
apparently
addressing
or
even
seeing
her
aileen
knew
well
enough
what
was
in
his
mind
at
times
quite
as
in
those
days
when
she
had
first
met
cowperwood
she
felt
an
unwilled
titillation
in
her
blood
her
eyes
brightened
it
was
just
possible
that
she
could
come
to
love
a
man
like
this
although
it
would
be
hard
it
would
serve
cowperwood
right
for
neglecting
her
yet
even
now
the
shadow
of
cowperwood
was
over
her
but
also
the
desire
for
love
and
a
full
sex
life
in
the
was
gathered
an
interested
and
fairly
smart
throng
actors
actresses
clubmen
one
or
two
very
emancipated
women
of
the
high
local
social
world
and
a
number
of
more
or
less
gentlemanly
young
gamblers
both
lord
and
mckibben
began
suggesting
column
numbers
for
first
plays
to
their
proteges
while
lynde
leaned
caressingly
over
aileen
powdered
shoulders
let
me
put
this
on
quatre
premier
for
you
he
suggested
throwing
down
a
gold
piece
oh
but
let
it
be
my
money
complained
aileen
i
want
to
play
with
my
money
i
wo
feel
that
it
mine
if
i
do
very
well
but
you
ca
just
now
you
ca
play
with
bills
she
was
extracting
a
crisp
roll
from
her
purse
i
have
to
exchange
them
later
for
you
for
gold
you
can
pay
me
then
he
going
to
call
now
anyhow
there
you
are
he
done
it
wait
a
moment
you
may
win
and
he
paused
to
study
the
little
ball
as
it
circled
round
and
round
above
the
receiving
pockets
let
me
see
how
much
do
i
get
if
i
win
quatre
premier
she
was
trying
to
recall
her
experiences
abroad
ten
for
one
replied
lynde
but
you
did
get
it
let
try
it
once
more
for
luck
it
comes
up
every
so
often
once
in
ten
or
twelve
i
made
it
often
on
a
first
play
how
long
has
it
been
since
the
last
quatre
premier
he
asked
of
a
neighbor
whom
he
recognized
seven
i
think
polk
six
or
seven
how
tricks
oh
so
so
he
turned
again
to
aileen
it
ought
to
come
up
now
soon
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
double
my
plays
each
time
it
gets
you
back
all
you
lost
some
time
or
other
he
put
down
two
twenties
goodness
she
exclaimed
that
will
be
two
hundred
i
had
forgotten
that
just
then
the
call
came
for
all
placements
to
cease
and
aileen
directed
her
attention
to
the
ball
it
circled
and
circled
in
its
dizzy
way
and
then
suddenly
dropped
lost
again
commented
lynde
well
now
we
make
it
eighty
and
he
threw
down
four
twenties
just
for
luck
we
put
something
on
and
thirteen
and
nine
with
an
easy
air
he
laid
one
hundred
dollars
in
gold
on
each
number
aileen
liked
his
manner
this
was
like
frank
lynde
had
the
cool
spirit
of
a
plunger
his
father
recognizing
his
temperament
had
set
over
a
large
fixed
sum
to
be
paid
to
him
annually
she
recognized
as
in
cowperwood
the
spirit
of
adventure
only
working
out
in
another
way
lynde
was
perhaps
destined
to
come
to
some
startlingly
reckless
end
but
what
of
it
he
was
a
gentleman
his
position
in
life
was
secure
that
had
always
been
aileen
sad
secret
thought
hers
had
not
been
and
might
never
be
now
oh
i
getting
foozled
already
she
exclaimed
gaily
reverting
to
a
girlhood
habit
of
clapping
her
hands
how
much
will
i
win
if
i
win
the
gesture
attracted
attention
even
as
the
ball
fell
by
george
you
have
it
exclaimed
lynde
who
was
watching
the
croupier
eight
hundred
two
hundred
two
hundred
he
was
counting
to
himself
but
we
lose
thirteen
very
good
that
makes
us
nearly
one
thousand
ahead
counting
out
what
we
put
down
rather
nice
for
a
beginning
do
you
think
now
if
you
take
my
advice
you
not
play
quatre
premier
any
more
for
a
while
suppose
you
double
a
thirteen
you
lost
on
that
and
play
bates
formula
i
show
you
what
that
is
already
because
he
was
known
to
be
a
plunger
lynde
was
gathering
a
few
spectators
behind
him
and
aileen
fascinated
and
not
knowing
these
mysteries
of
chance
was
content
to
watch
him
at
one
stage
of
the
playing
lynde
leaned
over
and
seeing
her
smile
whispered
what
adorable
hair
and
eyes
you
have
you
glow
like
a
great
rose
you
have
a
radiance
that
is
wonderful
oh
lynde
how
you
talk
does
gambling
always
affect
you
this
way
no
you
do
always
apparently
and
he
stared
hard
into
her
upturned
eyes
still
playing
ostensibly
for
aileen
benefit
he
now
doubled
the
cash
deposit
on
his
system
laying
down
a
thousand
in
gold
aileen
urged
him
to
play
for
himself
and
let
her
watch
i
just
put
a
little
money
on
these
odd
numbers
here
and
there
and
you
play
any
system
you
want
how
will
that
do
no
not
at
all
he
replied
feelingly
you
my
luck
i
play
with
you
you
keep
the
gold
for
me
i
make
you
a
fine
present
if
i
win
the
losses
are
mine
just
as
you
like
i
do
know
really
enough
about
it
to
play
but
i
surely
get
the
nice
present
if
you
win
you
do
win
or
lose
he
murmured
and
now
you
put
the
money
on
the
numbers
i
call
twenty
on
seven
eighty
on
thirteen
eighty
on
thirty
twenty
on
nine
fifty
on
he
was
following
a
system
of
his
own
and
in
obedience
aileen
white
plump
arm
reached
here
and
there
while
the
spectators
paused
realizing
that
heavier
playing
was
being
done
by
this
pair
than
by
any
one
else
lynde
was
plunging
for
effect
he
lost
a
thousand
and
fifty
dollars
at
one
clip
oh
all
that
good
money
exclaimed
aileen
as
the
croupier
raked
it
in
never
mind
we
get
it
back
exclaimed
lynde
throwing
two
bills
to
the
cashier
give
me
gold
for
those
the
man
gave
him
a
double
handful
which
he
put
down
between
white
arms
one
hundred
on
two
one
hundred
on
four
one
hundred
on
six
one
hundred
on
eight
the
pieces
were
gold
pieces
and
aileen
quickly
built
up
the
little
yellow
stacks
and
shoved
them
in
place
again
the
other
players
stopped
and
began
to
watch
the
odd
pair
aileen
head
and
pink
cheeks
and
swimming
eyes
her
body
swathed
in
silks
and
rich
laces
and
lynde
erect
his
shirt
bosom
snowy
white
his
face
dark
almost
coppery
his
eyes
and
hair
black
they
were
indeed
a
strikingly
assorted
pair
what
this
what
this
asked
grier
coming
up
who
plunging
you
mrs
cowperwood
not
plunging
replied
lynde
indifferently
we
merely
working
out
a
formula
cowperwood
and
i
we
doing
it
together
aileen
smiled
she
was
in
her
element
at
last
she
was
beginning
to
shine
she
was
attracting
attention
one
hundred
on
twelve
one
hundred
on
eighteen
one
hundred
on
good
heavens
what
are
you
up
to
lynde
exclaimed
lord
leaving
rhees
and
coming
over
she
followed
strangers
also
were
gathering
the
business
of
the
place
was
at
its
topmost
toss
it
being
two
in
the
morning
and
the
rooms
were
full
how
interesting
observed
miss
lanman
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
pausing
in
her
playing
and
staring
mckibben
who
was
beside
her
also
paused
they
plunging
do
look
at
all
the
money
goodness
she
and
he
aileen
shining
arm
was
moving
deftly
showily
about
look
at
the
bills
he
breaking
lynde
was
taking
out
a
thick
layer
of
fresh
yellow
bills
which
he
was
exchanging
for
gold
they
make
a
striking
pair
do
they
the
board
was
now
practically
covered
with
lynde
gold
in
quaint
little
stacks
he
had
followed
a
system
called
mazarin
which
should
give
him
five
for
one
and
possibly
break
the
bank
quite
a
crowd
swarmed
about
the
table
their
faces
glowing
in
the
artificial
light
the
exclamation
plunging
plunging
was
to
be
heard
whispered
here
and
there
lynde
was
delightfully
cool
and
straight
his
lithe
body
was
quite
erect
his
eyes
reflective
his
teeth
set
over
an
unlighted
cigarette
aileen
was
excited
as
a
child
delighted
to
be
once
more
the
center
of
comment
lord
looked
at
her
with
sympathetic
eyes
he
liked
her
well
let
her
he
amused
it
was
good
for
her
now
and
then
but
lynde
was
a
fool
to
make
a
show
of
himself
and
risk
so
much
money
table
closed
called
the
croupier
and
instantly
the
little
ball
began
to
spin
all
eyes
followed
it
round
and
round
it
went
aileen
as
keen
an
observer
as
any
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
bright
if
we
lose
this
said
lynde
we
will
make
one
more
bet
double
and
then
if
we
do
win
that
we
quit
he
was
already
out
nearly
three
thousand
dollars
oh
yes
indeed
only
i
think
we
ought
to
quit
now
here
goes
two
thousand
if
we
do
win
do
you
think
that
quite
enough
i
have
brought
you
much
luck
have
i
you
are
luck
he
whispered
all
the
luck
i
want
one
more
stand
by
me
for
one
more
try
will
you
if
we
win
i
quit
the
little
ball
clicked
even
as
she
nodded
and
the
croupier
paying
out
on
a
few
small
stacks
here
and
there
raked
all
the
rest
solemnly
into
the
receiving
orifice
while
murmurs
of
sympathetic
dissatisfaction
went
up
here
and
there
how
much
did
they
have
on
the
board
asked
miss
lanman
of
mckibben
in
surprise
it
must
have
been
a
great
deal
was
it
oh
two
thousand
dollars
perhaps
that
is
so
high
here
though
people
do
plunge
for
as
much
as
eight
or
ten
thousand
it
all
depends
mckibben
was
in
a
belittling
depreciating
mood
oh
yes
but
not
often
surely
for
the
love
of
heavens
polk
exclaimed
rhees
grier
coming
up
and
plucking
at
his
sleeve
if
you
want
to
give
your
money
away
give
it
to
me
i
can
gather
it
in
just
as
well
as
that
croupier
and
i
go
get
a
truck
and
haul
it
home
where
it
will
do
some
good
it
perfectly
terrible
the
way
you
are
carrying
on
lynde
took
his
loss
with
equanimity
now
to
double
it
he
observed
and
get
all
our
losses
back
or
go
downstairs
and
have
a
rarebit
and
some
champagne
what
form
of
a
present
would
please
you
best
but
never
mind
i
know
a
souvenir
for
this
occasion
he
smiled
and
bought
more
gold
aileen
stacked
it
up
showily
if
a
little
repentantly
she
did
not
quite
approve
of
this
his
plunging
and
yet
she
did
she
could
not
help
sympathizing
with
the
plunging
spirit
in
a
few
moments
it
was
on
the
board
the
same
combination
the
same
stacks
only
doubled
four
thousand
all
told
the
croupier
called
the
ball
rolled
and
fell
barring
three
hundred
dollars
returned
the
bank
took
it
all
well
now
for
a
rarebit
exclaimed
lynde
easily
turning
to
lord
who
stood
behind
him
smiling
you
have
a
match
have
you
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
that
sure
lynde
was
secretly
the
least
bit
disgruntled
for
if
he
had
won
he
had
intended
to
take
a
portion
of
the
winnings
and
put
it
in
a
necklace
or
some
other
gewgaw
for
aileen
now
he
must
pay
for
it
yet
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
having
made
an
impression
as
a
calm
and
indifferent
though
heavy
loser
he
gave
aileen
his
arm
well
my
lady
he
observed
we
did
win
but
we
had
a
little
fun
out
of
it
i
hope
that
combination
if
it
had
come
out
would
have
set
us
up
handsomely
better
luck
next
time
eh
he
smiled
genially
yes
but
i
was
to
have
been
your
luck
and
i
was
replied
aileen
you
are
all
the
luck
i
want
if
you
willing
to
be
come
to
the
richelieu
with
me
for
lunch
will
you
let
me
see
replied
aileen
who
observing
his
ready
and
somewhat
iron
fervor
was
doubtful
i
ca
do
that
she
said
finally
i
have
another
engagement
how
about
tuesday
then
aileen
realizing
of
a
sudden
that
she
was
making
much
of
a
situation
that
ought
to
be
handled
with
a
light
hand
answered
readily
very
well
tuesday
only
call
me
up
before
i
may
have
to
change
my
mind
or
the
time
and
she
smiled
after
this
lynde
had
no
opportunity
to
talk
to
aileen
privately
but
in
saying
good
night
he
ventured
to
press
her
arm
suggestively
she
suffered
a
peculiar
nervous
thrill
from
this
but
decided
curiously
that
she
had
brought
it
upon
herself
by
her
eagerness
for
life
and
revenge
and
must
make
up
her
mind
did
she
or
did
she
not
wish
to
go
on
with
this
this
was
the
question
uppermost
and
she
felt
that
she
must
decide
however
as
in
most
such
cases
circumstances
were
to
help
decide
for
her
and
unquestionably
a
portion
of
this
truth
was
in
her
mind
as
she
was
shown
gallantly
to
her
door
by
taylor
lord
chapter
xxxiii
lynde
to
the
rescue
the
interested
appearance
of
a
man
like
polk
lynde
at
this
stage
of
aileen
affairs
was
a
bit
of
fortuitous
or
gratuitous
humor
on
the
part
of
fate
which
is
involved
with
that
subconscious
chemistry
of
things
of
which
as
yet
we
know
nothing
here
was
aileen
brooding
over
her
fate
meditating
over
her
wrongs
as
it
were
and
here
was
polk
lynde
an
interesting
forceful
lothario
of
the
city
who
was
perhaps
as
well
suited
to
her
moods
and
her
tastes
at
this
time
as
any
male
outside
of
cowperwood
could
be
in
many
respects
lynde
was
a
charming
man
he
was
comparatively
young
not
more
than
aileen
own
age
schooled
if
not
educated
at
one
of
the
best
american
colleges
of
excellent
taste
in
the
matter
of
clothes
friends
and
the
details
of
living
with
which
he
chose
to
surround
himself
but
at
heart
a
rake
he
loved
and
had
from
his
youth
up
to
gamble
he
was
in
one
phase
of
the
word
a
hard
and
yet
by
no
means
a
drinker
for
he
had
an
iron
constitution
and
could
consume
spirituous
waters
with
the
minimum
of
ill
effect
he
had
what
gibbon
was
wont
to
call
the
most
amiable
of
our
vices
a
passion
for
women
and
he
cared
no
more
for
the
cool
patient
almost
penitent
methods
by
which
his
father
had
built
up
the
immense
reaper
business
of
which
he
was
supposedly
the
heir
than
he
cared
for
the
mysteries
or
sacred
rights
of
the
chaldees
he
realized
that
the
business
itself
was
a
splendid
thing
he
liked
on
occasion
to
think
of
it
with
all
its
extent
of
plain
buildings
tall
stacks
and
yelling
whistles
but
he
liked
in
no
way
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
rather
commonplace
routine
of
its
manipulation
the
principal
difficulty
with
aileen
under
these
circumstances
of
course
was
her
intense
vanity
and
never
was
there
a
vainer
or
more
woman
why
she
asked
herself
should
she
sit
here
in
loneliness
day
after
day
brooding
about
cowperwood
eating
her
heart
out
while
he
was
flitting
about
gathering
the
sweets
of
life
elsewhere
why
should
she
not
offer
her
continued
charms
as
a
solace
and
a
delight
to
other
men
who
would
appreciate
them
would
not
such
a
policy
have
all
the
essentials
of
justice
in
it
yet
even
now
so
precious
had
cowperwood
been
to
her
hitherto
and
so
wonderful
that
she
was
scarcely
able
to
think
of
serious
disloyalty
he
was
so
charming
when
he
was
nice
so
splendid
when
lynde
sought
to
hold
her
to
the
proposed
luncheon
engagement
she
at
first
declined
and
there
under
slightly
differing
conditions
the
matter
might
easily
have
stood
but
it
so
happened
that
just
at
this
time
aileen
was
being
almost
daily
harassed
by
additional
evidence
and
reminders
of
cowperwood
infidelity
for
instance
going
one
day
to
call
on
the
haguenins
for
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
keep
up
the
pretense
of
amity
in
so
long
as
they
had
not
found
out
the
truth
she
was
informed
that
haguenin
was
not
at
home
shortly
thereafter
the
press
which
had
always
been
favorable
to
cowperwood
and
which
aileen
regularly
read
because
of
its
friendly
comment
suddenly
veered
and
began
to
attack
him
there
were
solemn
suggestions
at
first
that
his
policy
and
intentions
might
not
be
in
accord
with
the
best
interests
of
the
city
a
little
later
haguenin
printed
editorials
which
referred
to
cowperwood
as
the
wrecker
the
philadelphia
adventurer
a
conscienceless
promoter
and
the
like
aileen
guessed
instantly
what
the
trouble
was
but
she
was
too
disturbed
as
to
her
own
position
to
make
any
comment
she
could
not
resolve
the
threats
and
menaces
of
cowperwood
envious
world
any
more
than
she
could
see
her
way
through
her
own
grim
difficulties
one
day
in
scanning
the
columns
of
that
faithful
chronicle
of
chicago
social
doings
the
chicago
saturday
review
she
came
across
an
item
which
served
as
a
final
blow
for
some
time
in
high
social
circles
the
paragraph
ran
speculation
has
been
rife
as
to
the
amours
and
liaisons
of
a
certain
individual
of
great
wealth
and
pseudo
social
prominence
who
once
made
a
serious
attempt
to
enter
chicago
society
it
is
not
necessary
to
name
the
man
for
all
who
are
acquainted
with
recent
events
in
chicago
will
know
who
is
meant
the
latest
rumor
to
affect
his
already
nefarious
reputation
relates
to
two
women
one
the
daughter
and
the
other
the
wife
of
men
of
repute
and
standing
in
the
community
in
these
latest
instances
it
is
more
than
likely
that
he
has
arrayed
influences
of
the
greatest
importance
socially
and
financially
against
himself
for
the
husband
in
the
one
case
and
the
father
in
the
other
are
men
of
weight
and
authority
the
suggestion
has
more
than
once
been
made
that
chicago
should
and
eventually
would
not
tolerate
his
bucaneering
methods
in
finance
and
social
matters
but
thus
far
no
definite
action
has
been
taken
to
cast
him
out
the
crowning
wonder
of
all
is
that
the
wife
who
was
brought
here
from
the
east
and
who
so
rumor
has
it
made
a
rather
scandalous
sacrifice
of
her
own
reputation
and
another
woman
heart
and
home
in
order
to
obtain
the
privilege
of
living
with
him
should
continue
so
to
do
aileen
understood
perfectly
what
was
meant
the
father
of
the
one
was
probably
haguenin
or
cochrane
more
than
likely
haguenin
the
husband
of
the
other
but
who
was
the
husband
of
the
other
she
had
not
heard
of
any
scandal
with
the
wife
of
anybody
it
could
not
be
the
case
of
rita
sohlberg
and
her
husband
that
was
too
far
back
it
must
be
some
new
affair
of
which
she
had
not
the
least
inkling
and
so
she
sat
and
reflected
now
she
told
herself
if
she
received
another
invitation
from
lynde
she
would
accept
it
it
was
only
a
few
days
later
that
aileen
and
lynde
met
in
the
of
the
richelieu
strange
to
relate
for
one
determined
to
be
indifferent
she
had
spent
much
time
in
making
a
fetching
toilet
it
being
february
and
chill
with
glittering
snow
on
the
ground
she
had
chosen
a
broadcloth
gown
quite
new
with
buttons
that
worked
a
y
pattern
across
her
bosom
a
seal
turban
with
an
emerald
plume
which
complemented
a
sealskin
jacket
with
immense
wrought
silver
buttons
and
bronze
shoes
to
perfect
it
all
aileen
had
fastened
of
a
small
in
her
ears
and
wore
a
plain
heavy
gold
bracelet
lynde
came
up
with
a
look
of
keen
approval
written
on
his
handsome
brown
face
will
you
let
me
tell
you
how
nice
you
look
he
said
sinking
into
the
chair
opposite
you
show
beautiful
taste
in
choosing
the
right
colors
your
go
so
well
with
your
hair
although
aileen
feared
because
of
his
desperateness
she
was
caught
by
his
sleek
force
that
air
of
iron
strength
under
a
parlor
mask
his
long
brown
artistic
hands
hard
and
muscular
indicated
an
idle
force
that
might
be
used
in
many
ways
they
harmonized
with
his
teeth
and
chin
so
you
came
did
you
he
went
on
looking
at
her
steadily
while
she
fronted
his
gaze
boldly
for
a
moment
only
to
look
evasively
down
he
still
studied
her
carefully
looking
at
her
chin
and
mouth
and
piquant
nose
in
her
colorful
cheeks
and
strong
arms
and
shoulders
indicated
by
her
suit
he
recognized
the
human
vigor
he
most
craved
in
a
woman
by
way
of
diversion
he
ordered
an
whisky
cocktail
urging
her
to
join
him
finding
her
obdurate
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
box
we
agreed
when
we
played
the
other
night
on
a
memento
did
we
he
said
a
sort
of
souvenir
guess
aileen
looked
at
it
a
little
nonplussed
recognizing
the
contents
of
the
box
to
be
jewelry
oh
you
should
have
done
that
she
protested
the
understanding
was
that
we
were
to
win
you
lost
and
that
ended
the
bargain
i
should
have
shared
the
losses
i
forgiven
you
for
that
yet
you
know
how
ungallant
that
would
make
me
he
said
smilingly
as
he
trifled
with
the
long
thin
lacquered
case
you
would
want
to
make
me
ungallant
would
you
be
a
good
fellow
a
good
sport
as
they
say
guess
and
it
yours
aileen
pursed
her
lips
at
this
ardent
entreaty
oh
i
do
mind
guessing
she
commented
superiorly
though
i
take
it
it
might
be
a
pin
it
might
be
a
set
of
it
might
be
a
bracelet
he
made
no
comment
but
opened
it
revealing
a
necklace
of
gold
wrought
into
the
form
of
a
of
the
most
curious
workmanship
with
a
cluster
of
leaves
artistically
carved
and
arranged
as
a
breastpiece
the
center
of
them
formed
by
a
black
opal
which
shone
with
an
enticing
luster
lynde
knew
well
enough
that
aileen
was
familiar
with
many
jewels
and
that
only
one
of
ornate
construction
and
value
would
appeal
to
her
sense
of
what
was
becoming
to
her
he
watched
her
face
closely
while
she
studied
the
details
of
the
necklace
is
it
exquisite
she
commented
what
a
lovely
opal
what
an
odd
design
she
went
over
the
separate
leaves
you
should
be
so
foolish
i
could
take
it
i
have
too
many
things
as
it
is
and
besides
she
was
thinking
of
what
she
would
say
if
cowperwood
chanced
to
ask
her
where
she
got
it
he
was
so
intuitive
and
besides
he
queried
nothing
she
replied
except
that
i
must
take
it
really
you
take
it
as
a
souvenir
even
if
our
agreement
you
know
even
if
what
she
queried
even
if
nothing
else
comes
of
it
a
memento
then
truly
you
know
he
laid
hold
of
her
fingers
with
his
cool
vigorous
ones
a
year
before
even
six
months
aileen
would
have
released
her
hand
smilingly
now
she
hesitated
why
should
she
be
so
squeamish
with
other
men
when
cowperwood
was
so
unkind
to
her
tell
me
something
lynde
asked
noting
the
doubt
and
holding
her
fingers
gently
but
firmly
do
you
care
for
me
at
all
i
like
you
yes
i
ca
say
that
it
is
anything
more
than
that
she
flushed
though
in
spite
of
herself
he
merely
gazed
at
her
with
his
hard
burning
eyes
the
materiality
that
accompanies
romance
in
so
many
temperaments
awakened
in
her
and
quite
put
cowperwood
out
of
her
mind
for
the
moment
it
was
an
astonishing
and
revolutionary
experience
for
her
she
quite
burned
in
reply
and
lynde
smiled
sweetly
encouragingly
why
wo
you
be
friends
with
me
my
sweetheart
i
know
you
not
happy
i
can
see
that
neither
am
i
have
a
wreckless
wretched
disposition
that
gets
me
into
all
sorts
of
hell
i
need
some
one
to
care
for
me
why
wo
you
you
just
my
sort
i
feel
it
do
you
love
him
so
much
he
was
referring
to
cowperwood
that
you
ca
love
any
one
else
oh
him
retorted
aileen
irritably
almost
disloyally
he
care
for
me
any
more
he
would
mind
it
is
him
well
then
what
is
it
why
wo
you
am
i
not
interesting
enough
do
you
like
me
do
you
feel
that
i
really
suited
to
you
his
hand
sought
hers
softly
aileen
accepted
the
caress
oh
it
is
that
she
replied
feelingly
running
back
in
her
mind
over
her
long
career
with
cowperwood
his
former
love
his
keen
protestations
she
had
expected
to
make
so
much
out
of
her
life
with
him
and
here
she
was
sitting
in
a
public
restaurant
flirting
with
and
extracting
sympathy
from
a
comparative
stranger
it
cut
her
to
the
quick
for
the
moment
and
sealed
her
lips
hot
unbidden
tears
welled
to
her
eyes
lynde
saw
them
he
was
really
very
sorry
for
her
though
her
beauty
made
him
wish
to
take
advantage
of
her
distress
why
should
you
cry
dearest
he
asked
softly
looking
at
her
flushed
cheeks
and
colorful
eyes
you
have
beauty
you
are
young
you
lovely
he
not
the
only
man
in
the
world
why
should
you
be
faithful
when
he
faithful
to
you
this
hand
affair
is
all
over
town
when
you
meet
some
one
that
really
would
care
for
you
why
should
you
if
he
want
you
there
are
others
at
the
mention
of
the
hand
affair
aileen
straightened
up
the
hand
affair
she
asked
curiously
what
is
that
do
you
know
he
replied
a
little
surprised
i
thought
you
did
or
i
certainly
would
have
mentioned
it
oh
i
know
about
what
it
is
replied
aileen
wisely
and
with
a
touch
of
sardonic
humor
there
have
been
so
many
or
the
same
kind
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
case
the
chicago
review
was
referring
to
the
wife
of
the
prominent
financier
has
he
been
trifling
with
mrs
hand
something
like
that
replied
lynde
i
sorry
that
i
spoke
though
really
i
am
i
did
mean
to
be
carrying
tales
soldiers
in
a
common
fight
eh
taunted
aileen
gaily
oh
not
that
exactly
please
do
be
mean
i
not
so
bad
just
a
principle
with
me
we
all
have
our
little
foibles
yes
i
know
replied
aileen
but
her
mind
was
running
on
hand
so
she
was
the
latest
well
i
admire
his
taste
anyway
in
this
case
she
said
archly
there
have
been
so
many
though
she
is
just
one
more
lynde
smiled
he
himself
admired
cowperwood
taste
then
he
dropped
the
subject
but
let
forget
that
he
said
please
do
worry
about
him
any
more
you
ca
change
that
pull
yourself
together
he
squeezed
her
fingers
will
you
he
asked
lifting
his
eyebrows
in
inquiry
will
i
what
replied
aileen
meditatively
oh
you
know
the
necklace
for
one
thing
me
too
his
eyes
coaxed
and
laughed
and
pleaded
aileen
smiled
you
a
bad
boy
she
said
evasively
this
revelation
in
regard
to
hand
had
made
her
singularly
retaliatory
in
spirit
let
me
think
do
ask
me
to
take
the
necklace
i
could
i
could
wear
it
anyhow
let
me
see
you
another
time
she
moved
her
plump
hand
in
an
uncertain
way
and
he
smoothed
her
wrist
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
to
go
around
to
the
studio
of
a
friend
of
mine
here
in
the
tower
he
asked
quite
nonchalantly
he
has
such
a
charming
collection
of
landscapes
you
interested
in
pictures
i
know
your
husband
has
some
of
the
finest
instantly
aileen
understood
what
was
meant
quite
by
instinct
the
alleged
studio
must
be
private
bachelor
quarters
not
this
afternoon
she
replied
quite
wrought
up
and
disturbed
not
another
time
and
i
must
be
going
now
but
i
will
see
you
and
this
he
asked
picking
up
the
necklace
you
keep
it
until
i
do
come
she
replied
i
may
take
it
then
she
relaxed
a
little
pleased
that
she
was
getting
safely
away
but
her
mood
was
anything
but
antagonistic
and
her
spirits
were
as
shredded
as
clouds
it
was
time
she
wanted
a
little
time
that
was
all
chapter
xxxiv
enter
hosmer
hand
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
solemn
rage
of
hand
to
say
nothing
of
the
pathetic
anger
of
haguenin
coupled
with
the
wrath
of
redmond
purdy
who
related
to
all
his
sad
story
and
of
young
macdonald
and
his
associates
of
the
chicago
general
company
constituted
an
atmosphere
highly
charged
with
possibilities
and
potent
for
dramatic
results
the
most
serious
element
in
this
at
present
was
hosmer
hand
who
being
exceedingly
wealthy
and
a
director
in
a
number
of
the
principal
mercantile
and
financial
institutions
of
the
city
was
in
a
position
to
do
cowperwood
some
real
financial
harm
hand
had
been
extremely
fond
of
his
young
wife
being
a
man
of
but
few
experiences
with
women
it
astonished
and
enraged
him
that
a
man
like
cowperwood
should
dare
to
venture
on
his
preserves
in
this
reckless
way
should
take
his
dignity
so
lightly
he
burned
now
with
a
hot
slow
fire
of
revenge
those
who
know
anything
concerning
the
financial
world
and
its
great
adventures
know
how
precious
is
that
reputation
for
probity
solidarity
and
conservatism
on
which
so
many
of
the
successful
enterprises
of
the
world
are
based
if
men
are
not
absolutely
honest
themselves
they
at
least
wish
for
and
have
faith
in
the
honesty
of
others
no
set
of
men
know
more
about
each
other
garner
more
carefully
all
the
straws
of
rumor
which
may
affect
the
financial
and
social
well
being
of
an
individual
one
way
or
another
keep
a
tighter
mouth
concerning
their
own
affairs
and
a
sharper
eye
on
that
of
their
neighbors
cowperwood
credit
had
hitherto
been
good
because
it
was
known
that
he
had
a
soft
thing
in
the
chicago
field
that
he
paid
his
interest
charges
promptly
that
he
had
organized
the
group
of
men
who
now
under
him
controlled
the
chicago
trust
company
and
the
north
and
west
chicago
street
railways
and
that
the
lake
city
bank
of
which
addison
was
still
president
considered
his
collateral
sound
nevertheless
even
previous
to
this
time
there
had
been
a
protesting
element
in
the
shape
of
schryhart
simms
and
others
of
considerable
import
in
the
douglas
trust
who
had
lost
no
chance
to
say
to
one
and
all
that
cowperwood
was
an
interloper
and
that
his
course
was
marked
by
political
and
social
trickery
and
chicanery
if
not
by
financial
dishonesty
as
a
matter
of
fact
schryhart
who
had
once
been
a
director
of
the
lake
city
national
along
with
hand
arneel
and
others
had
resigned
and
withdrawn
all
his
deposits
sometime
before
because
he
found
as
he
declared
that
addison
was
favoring
cowperwood
and
the
chicago
trust
company
with
loans
when
there
was
no
need
of
so
doing
when
it
was
not
essentially
advantageous
for
the
bank
so
to
do
both
arneel
and
hand
having
at
this
time
no
personal
quarrel
with
cowperwood
on
any
score
had
considered
this
protest
as
biased
addison
had
maintained
that
the
loans
were
neither
unduly
large
nor
out
of
proportion
to
the
general
loans
of
the
bank
the
collateral
offered
was
excellent
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
schryhart
addison
had
protested
at
the
time
but
i
am
afraid
his
charge
is
unfair
he
is
trying
to
vent
a
private
grudge
through
the
lake
national
that
is
not
the
way
nor
this
the
place
to
do
it
both
hand
and
arneel
sober
men
both
agreed
with
this
admiring
addison
and
so
the
case
stood
schryhart
however
frequently
intimated
to
them
both
that
cowperwood
was
merely
building
up
the
chicago
trust
company
at
the
expense
of
the
lake
city
national
in
order
to
make
the
former
strong
enough
to
do
without
any
aid
at
which
time
addison
would
resign
and
the
lake
city
would
be
allowed
to
shift
for
itself
hand
had
never
acted
on
this
suggestion
but
he
had
thought
it
was
not
until
the
incidents
relating
to
cowperwood
and
hand
had
come
to
light
that
things
financial
and
otherwise
began
to
darken
up
hand
being
greatly
hurt
in
his
pride
contemplated
only
severe
reprisal
meeting
schryhart
at
a
directors
meeting
one
day
not
long
after
his
difficulty
had
come
upon
him
he
remarked
i
thought
a
few
years
ago
norman
when
you
talked
to
me
about
this
man
cowperwood
that
you
were
merely
jealous
a
dissatisfied
business
rival
recently
a
few
things
have
come
to
my
notice
which
cause
me
to
think
differently
it
is
very
plain
to
me
now
that
the
man
is
thoroughly
bad
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
it
a
pity
the
city
has
to
endure
him
so
you
just
beginning
to
find
that
out
are
you
hosmer
answered
schryhart
well
i
not
say
i
told
you
so
perhaps
you
agree
with
me
now
that
the
responsible
people
of
chicago
ought
to
do
something
about
it
hand
a
very
heavy
taciturn
man
merely
looked
at
him
i
be
ready
enough
to
do
he
said
when
i
see
how
and
what
to
be
done
a
little
later
schryhart
meeting
duane
kingsland
learned
the
true
source
of
hand
feeling
against
cowperwood
and
was
not
slow
in
transferring
this
titbit
to
merrill
simms
and
others
merrill
who
though
cowperwood
had
refused
to
extend
his
la
salle
street
tunnel
loop
about
state
street
and
his
store
had
hitherto
always
liked
him
after
a
fashion
remotely
admired
his
courage
and
daring
was
now
appropriately
shocked
why
anson
observed
schryhart
the
man
is
no
good
he
has
the
heart
of
a
hyena
and
the
friendliness
of
a
scorpion
you
heard
how
he
treated
hand
did
you
no
replied
merrill
i
did
well
it
this
way
so
i
hear
and
schryhart
leaned
over
and
confidentially
communicated
considerable
information
into
left
ear
the
latter
raised
his
eyebrows
indeed
he
said
and
the
way
he
came
to
meet
her
added
schryhart
contemptuously
was
this
he
went
to
hand
originally
to
borrow
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
west
chicago
street
railway
angry
the
word
is
no
name
for
it
you
do
say
so
commented
merrill
dryly
though
privately
interested
and
fascinated
for
hand
had
always
seemed
very
attractive
to
him
i
do
wonder
he
recalled
that
his
own
wife
had
recently
insisted
on
inviting
cowperwood
once
similarly
hand
meeting
arneel
not
so
long
afterward
confided
to
him
that
cowperwood
was
trying
to
repudiate
a
sacred
agreement
arneel
was
grieved
and
surprised
it
was
enough
for
him
to
know
that
hand
had
been
seriously
injured
between
the
two
of
them
they
now
decided
to
indicate
to
addison
as
president
of
the
lake
city
bank
that
all
relations
with
cowperwood
and
the
chicago
trust
company
must
cease
the
result
of
this
was
not
long
after
that
addison
very
suave
and
gracious
agreed
to
give
cowperwood
due
warning
that
all
his
loans
would
have
to
be
taken
care
of
and
then
resigned
to
become
seven
months
later
president
of
the
chicago
trust
company
this
desertion
created
a
great
stir
at
the
time
astonishing
the
very
men
who
had
suspected
that
it
might
come
to
pass
the
papers
were
full
of
it
well
let
him
go
observed
arneel
to
hand
sourly
on
the
day
that
addison
notified
the
board
of
directors
of
the
lake
city
of
his
contemplated
resignation
if
he
wants
to
sever
his
connection
with
a
bank
like
this
to
go
with
a
man
like
that
it
his
own
lookout
he
may
live
to
regret
it
it
so
happened
that
by
now
another
election
was
pending
chicago
and
hand
along
with
schryhart
and
arneel
who
joined
their
forces
because
of
his
friendship
for
hand
decided
to
try
to
fight
cowperwood
through
this
means
hosmer
hand
feeling
that
he
had
the
burden
of
a
great
duty
upon
him
was
not
slow
in
acting
he
was
always
when
aroused
a
determined
and
able
fighter
needing
an
able
lieutenant
in
the
impending
political
conflict
he
finally
bethought
himself
of
a
man
who
had
recently
come
to
figure
somewhat
conspicuously
in
chicago
politics
one
patrick
gilgan
the
same
patrick
gilgan
of
cowperwood
old
hyde
park
days
gilgan
was
now
a
comparatively
man
owing
to
a
genial
capacity
for
mixing
with
people
a
close
mouth
and
absolutely
no
understanding
of
and
consequently
no
conscience
in
matters
of
large
public
import
in
so
far
as
they
related
to
the
rights
of
the
mass
he
was
a
fit
individual
to
succeed
politically
his
saloon
was
the
finest
in
all
wentworth
avenue
it
fairly
glittered
with
the
newly
introduced
incandescent
lamp
reflected
in
a
perfect
world
of
beveled
and
faceted
mirrors
his
ward
or
district
was
full
of
low
cottages
crowded
together
along
streets
but
patrick
gilgan
was
now
a
state
senator
slated
for
congress
at
the
next
congressional
election
and
a
possible
successor
of
the
hon
john
mckenty
as
dictator
of
the
city
if
only
the
republican
party
should
come
into
power
hyde
park
before
it
had
been
annexed
to
the
city
had
always
been
republican
and
since
then
although
the
larger
city
was
normally
democratic
gilgan
could
not
conveniently
change
hearing
from
the
political
discussion
which
preceded
the
election
that
gilgan
was
by
far
the
most
powerful
politician
on
the
south
side
hand
sent
for
him
personally
hand
had
far
less
sympathy
with
the
polite
moralistic
efforts
of
men
like
haguenin
hyssop
and
others
who
were
content
to
preach
morality
and
strive
to
win
by
the
efforts
of
the
unco
good
than
he
had
with
the
cold
political
logic
of
a
man
like
cowperwood
himself
if
cowperwood
could
work
through
mckenty
to
such
a
powerful
end
he
hand
could
find
some
one
else
who
could
be
made
as
powerful
as
mckenty
gilgan
said
hand
when
the
irishman
came
in
medium
tall
beefy
with
shrewd
twinkling
gray
eyes
and
hairy
hands
you
do
know
me
i
know
of
you
well
enough
smiled
the
irishman
with
a
soft
brogue
you
do
need
an
introduction
to
talk
to
me
very
good
replied
hand
extending
his
hand
i
know
of
you
too
then
we
can
talk
it
the
political
situation
here
in
chicago
like
to
discuss
with
you
i
not
a
politician
myself
but
i
take
some
interest
in
what
going
on
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
will
be
the
probable
outcome
of
the
present
situation
here
in
the
city
gilgan
having
no
reason
for
laying
his
private
political
convictions
bare
to
any
one
whose
motive
he
did
not
know
merely
replied
oh
i
think
the
republicans
may
have
a
pretty
good
show
they
have
all
but
one
or
two
of
the
papers
with
them
i
see
i
do
know
much
outside
of
what
i
read
and
hear
people
talk
hand
knew
that
gilgan
was
sparring
and
was
glad
to
find
his
man
canny
and
calculating
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
just
to
be
talking
over
politics
in
general
as
you
may
imagine
gilgan
i
want
to
put
a
particular
problem
before
you
do
you
happen
to
know
either
mckenty
or
mr
cowperwood
i
never
met
either
of
them
to
talk
to
replied
gilgan
i
know
mckenty
by
sight
and
i
seen
cowperwood
once
he
said
no
more
well
said
hand
suppose
a
group
of
influential
men
here
in
chicago
were
to
get
together
and
guarantee
sufficient
funds
for
a
campaign
now
if
you
had
the
complete
support
of
the
newspapers
and
the
republican
organization
in
the
bargain
could
you
organize
the
opposition
here
so
that
the
democratic
party
could
be
beaten
this
fall
i
not
talking
about
the
mayor
merely
and
the
principal
city
officers
but
the
council
too
the
aldermen
i
want
to
fix
things
so
that
the
crowd
could
get
an
alderman
or
a
city
official
to
sell
out
once
they
are
elected
i
want
the
democratic
party
beaten
so
thoroughly
that
there
wo
be
any
question
in
anybody
mind
as
to
the
fact
that
it
has
been
done
there
will
be
plenty
of
money
forthcoming
if
you
can
prove
to
me
or
rather
to
the
group
of
men
i
am
thinking
of
that
the
thing
can
be
done
gilgan
blinked
his
eyes
solemnly
he
rubbed
his
knees
put
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
vest
took
out
a
cigar
lit
it
and
gazed
poetically
at
the
ceiling
he
was
thinking
very
very
hard
cowperwood
and
mckenty
as
he
knew
were
very
powerful
men
he
had
always
managed
to
down
the
mckenty
opposition
in
his
ward
and
several
others
adjacent
to
it
and
in
the
eighteenth
senatorial
district
which
he
represented
but
to
be
called
upon
to
defeat
him
in
chicago
that
was
different
still
the
thought
of
a
large
amount
of
cash
to
be
distributed
through
him
and
the
chance
of
wresting
the
city
leadership
from
mckenty
by
the
aid
of
the
moral
forces
of
the
city
was
very
inspiring
gilgan
was
a
good
politician
he
loved
to
scheme
and
plot
and
make
deals
as
much
for
the
fun
of
it
as
anything
else
just
now
he
drew
a
solemn
face
which
however
concealed
a
very
light
heart
i
have
heard
went
on
hand
that
you
have
built
up
a
strong
organization
in
your
ward
and
district
i
managed
to
hold
me
own
suggested
gilgan
archly
but
this
winning
all
over
chicago
he
went
on
after
a
moment
now
that
a
pretty
large
order
there
are
wards
in
chicago
this
election
and
all
but
eight
of
them
are
nominally
democratic
i
know
most
of
the
men
that
are
in
them
now
and
some
of
them
are
pretty
shrewd
men
too
this
man
dowling
in
council
is
nobody
fool
let
me
tell
you
that
then
there
duvanicki
and
ungerich
and
tiernan
and
kerrigan
all
good
men
he
mentioned
four
of
the
most
powerful
and
crooked
aldermen
in
the
city
you
see
hand
the
way
things
are
now
the
democrats
have
the
offices
and
the
small
jobs
to
give
out
that
gives
them
plenty
of
political
workers
to
begin
with
then
they
have
the
privilege
of
collecting
money
from
those
in
office
to
help
elect
themselves
that
another
great
privilege
he
smiled
then
this
man
cowperwood
employs
all
of
ten
thousand
men
at
present
and
any
ward
boss
that
favorable
to
him
can
send
a
man
out
of
work
to
him
and
he
find
a
place
for
him
that
a
help
in
building
up
a
party
following
then
there
the
money
a
man
like
cowperwood
and
others
can
contribute
at
election
time
say
what
you
will
hand
but
it
the
two
and
five
and
ten
dollar
bills
paid
out
at
the
last
moment
over
the
saloon
bars
and
at
the
that
do
the
work
give
me
enough
money
and
at
this
noble
thought
gilgan
straightened
up
and
slapped
one
fist
lightly
in
the
other
adjusting
at
the
same
time
his
cigar
so
that
it
should
not
burn
his
hand
and
i
can
carry
every
ward
in
chicago
bar
none
if
i
have
money
enough
he
repeated
emphasizing
the
last
two
words
he
put
his
cigar
back
in
his
mouth
blinked
his
eyes
defiantly
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
very
good
commented
hand
simply
but
how
much
money
ah
that
another
question
replied
gilgan
straightening
up
once
more
some
wards
require
more
than
others
counting
out
the
eight
that
are
normally
republican
as
safe
you
would
have
to
carry
eighteen
others
to
have
a
majority
in
council
i
do
see
how
anything
under
ten
to
fifteen
thousand
dollars
to
a
ward
would
be
safe
to
go
on
i
should
say
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
would
be
safer
and
that
would
be
any
too
much
by
any
means
gilgan
restored
his
cigar
and
puffed
heavily
the
while
he
leaned
back
and
lifted
his
eyes
once
more
and
how
would
that
money
be
distributed
exactly
inquired
hand
oh
well
it
never
wise
to
look
into
such
matters
too
closely
commented
gilgan
comfortably
there
such
a
thing
as
cutting
your
cloth
too
close
in
politics
there
are
ward
captains
leaders
block
captains
workers
they
all
have
to
have
money
to
do
with
to
work
up
sentiment
and
you
ca
be
too
inquiring
as
to
just
how
they
do
it
it
spent
in
saloons
and
buying
coal
for
mother
and
getting
johnnie
a
new
suit
here
and
there
then
there
are
processions
and
and
jobs
to
look
after
sure
there
plenty
of
places
for
it
some
men
may
have
to
be
brought
into
these
wards
to
live
kept
in
for
a
week
or
ten
days
he
waved
a
hand
deprecatingly
hand
who
had
never
busied
himself
with
the
minutiae
of
politics
opened
his
eyes
slightly
this
colonizing
idea
was
a
little
liberal
he
thought
who
distributes
this
money
he
asked
finally
nominally
the
republican
county
committee
if
it
in
charge
actually
the
man
or
men
who
are
leading
the
fight
in
the
case
of
the
democratic
party
it
john
mckenty
and
do
you
forget
it
in
my
district
it
me
and
no
one
else
hand
slow
solid
almost
obtuse
at
times
meditated
under
lowering
brows
he
had
always
been
associated
with
a
more
or
less
crew
who
were
unused
to
the
rough
usage
of
saloon
politics
yet
every
one
suspected
vaguely
of
course
at
times
that
were
stuffed
and
ward
colonized
every
one
at
least
every
one
of
any
worldly
intelligence
knew
that
political
capital
was
collected
from
beneficiaries
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
under
the
reigning
city
administration
hand
had
himself
contributed
to
the
republican
party
for
favors
received
or
about
to
be
as
a
man
who
had
been
compelled
to
handle
large
affairs
in
a
large
way
he
was
not
inclined
to
quarrel
with
this
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
was
a
large
sum
and
he
was
not
inclined
to
subscribe
it
alone
but
fancied
that
at
his
recommendation
and
with
his
advice
it
could
be
raised
was
gilgan
the
man
to
fight
cowperwood
he
looked
him
over
and
decided
other
things
being
equal
that
he
was
and
forthwith
the
bargain
was
struck
gilgan
as
a
republican
central
committeeman
chairman
possibly
was
to
visit
every
ward
connect
up
with
every
available
republican
force
pick
strong
suitable
candidates
and
try
to
elect
them
while
he
hand
organized
the
money
element
and
collected
the
necessary
cash
gilgan
was
to
be
given
money
personally
he
was
to
have
the
undivided
if
secret
support
of
all
the
high
republican
elements
in
the
city
his
business
was
to
win
at
almost
any
cost
and
as
a
reward
he
was
to
have
the
republican
support
for
congress
or
failing
that
the
practical
republican
leadership
in
city
and
county
anyhow
said
hand
after
gilgan
finally
took
his
departure
things
wo
be
so
easy
for
cowperwood
in
the
future
as
they
were
in
the
past
and
when
it
comes
to
getting
his
franchises
renewed
if
i
alive
we
see
whether
he
will
or
not
the
heavy
financier
actually
growled
a
low
growl
as
he
spoke
out
loud
to
himself
he
felt
a
boundless
rancor
toward
the
man
who
had
as
he
supposed
alienated
the
affections
of
his
smart
young
wife

tiernan
and
patrick
alias
emerald
pat
kerrigan
who
for
picturequeness
of
character
and
sordidness
of
atmosphere
could
not
be
equaled
elsewhere
in
the
city
if
in
the
nation
at
large
smiling
mike
tiernan
proud
possessor
of
four
of
the
largest
and
filthiest
saloons
of
this
area
was
a
man
of
large
and
genial
mold
perhaps
six
feet
one
inch
in
height
in
proportion
with
a
bovine
head
from
one
angle
and
big
healthy
hairy
hands
and
large
feet
he
had
done
many
things
from
digging
in
a
ditch
to
occupying
a
seat
in
the
city
council
from
this
his
beloved
ward
which
he
sold
out
regularly
for
one
purpose
and
another
but
his
chief
present
joy
consisted
in
sitting
behind
a
solid
mahogany
railing
at
a
rosewood
desk
in
the
back
portion
of
his
largest
clark
street
hostelry
the
silver
moon
here
he
counted
up
the
returns
from
his
various
properties
salons
gambling
resorts
and
houses
of
prostitution
which
he
manipulated
with
the
connivance
or
blinking
courtesy
of
the
present
administration
and
listened
to
the
pleas
and
demands
of
his
henchmen
and
tenants
the
character
of
kerrigan
tiernan
only
rival
in
this
rather
difficult
and
sordid
region
was
somewhat
different
he
was
a
small
man
quite
dapper
with
a
lean
hollow
and
somewhat
haggard
face
but
by
no
means
sickly
body
a
large
strident
mustache
a
wealth
of
hair
parted
slickly
on
one
side
and
a
shrewd
genial
eye
constituting
altogether
a
rather
pleasing
and
ornate
figure
whom
it
was
not
at
all
unsatisfactory
to
meet
his
ears
were
large
and
stood
out
from
his
head
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
smart
evasive
light
he
was
cleverer
financially
than
tiernan
richer
and
no
more
than
whereas
tiernan
was
years
of
age
like
tiernan
in
the
first
ward
kerrigan
was
a
power
in
the
second
and
controlled
a
most
useful
and
dangerous
floating
vote
his
saloons
harbored
the
largest
floating
element
that
was
to
be
found
in
the
city
longshoremen
railroad
hands
stevedores
tramps
thugs
thieves
pimps
rounders
detectives
and
the
like
he
was
very
vain
considered
himself
handsome
a
killer
with
the
ladies
married
and
with
two
children
and
a
sedate
young
wife
he
still
had
his
mistress
who
changed
from
year
to
year
and
his
intermediate
girls
his
clothes
were
altogether
noteworthy
but
it
was
his
pride
to
eschew
jewelry
except
for
one
enormous
emerald
value
fourteen
thousand
dollars
which
he
wore
in
his
necktie
on
occasions
and
the
wonder
of
which
pervading
all
dearborn
street
and
the
city
council
had
won
him
the
soubriquet
of
emerald
pat
at
first
he
rejoiced
heartily
in
this
title
as
he
did
in
a
gold
and
diamond
medal
awarded
him
by
a
chicago
brewery
for
selling
the
largest
number
of
barrels
of
beer
of
any
saloon
in
chicago
more
recently
the
newspapers
having
begun
to
pay
humorous
attention
to
both
himself
and
tiernan
because
of
their
prosperity
and
individuality
he
resented
it
the
relation
of
these
two
men
to
the
present
political
situation
was
peculiar
and
as
it
turned
out
was
to
constitute
the
weak
spot
in
the
campaign
tiernan
and
kerrigan
to
begin
with
being
neighbors
and
friends
worked
together
in
politics
and
business
on
occasions
pooling
their
issues
and
doing
each
other
favors
the
enterprises
in
which
they
were
engaged
being
low
and
shabby
they
needed
counsel
and
consolation
infinitely
beneath
a
man
like
mckenty
in
understanding
and
a
politic
grasp
of
life
they
were
nevertheless
as
they
prospered
somewhat
jealous
of
him
and
his
high
estate
they
saw
with
speculative
and
somewhat
jealous
eyes
how
after
his
union
with
cowperwood
he
grew
and
how
he
managed
to
work
his
will
in
many
ways
by
extracting
tolls
from
the
police
department
and
heavy
annual
campaign
contributions
from
manufacturers
favored
by
the
city
gas
and
water
departments
mckenty
a
born
manipulator
in
this
respect
knew
where
political
funds
were
to
be
had
in
an
hour
of
emergency
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
demand
them
tiernan
and
kerrigan
had
always
been
fairly
treated
by
him
as
politics
go
but
they
had
never
as
yet
been
included
in
his
inner
council
of
plotters
when
he
was
on
one
errand
or
another
he
stopped
in
at
their
places
to
shake
hands
with
them
to
inquire
after
business
to
ask
if
there
was
any
favor
he
could
do
them
but
never
did
he
stoop
to
ask
a
favor
of
them
or
personally
to
promise
any
form
of
reward
that
was
the
business
of
dowling
and
others
through
whom
he
worked
naturally
men
of
strong
restive
animal
disposition
finding
no
complete
outlet
for
all
their
growing
capacity
tiernan
and
kerrigan
were
both
curious
to
see
in
what
way
they
could
add
to
their
honors
and
emoluments
their
wards
more
than
any
in
the
city
were
increasing
in
what
might
be
called
a
capacity
the
honest
legitimate
vote
not
being
so
large
but
the
opportunities
afforded
for
colonizing
repeating
and
stuffing
being
immense
in
a
doubtful
mayoralty
campaign
the
first
and
second
wards
alone
coupled
with
a
portion
of
the
third
adjoining
them
would
register
sufficient
illegitimate
votes
after
if
necessary
to
completely
change
the
complexion
of
the
city
as
to
the
general
officers
nominated
large
amounts
of
money
were
sent
to
tiernan
and
kerrigan
around
election
time
by
the
democratic
county
committee
to
be
disposed
of
as
they
saw
fit
they
merely
sent
in
a
rough
estimate
of
how
much
they
would
need
and
always
received
a
little
more
than
they
asked
for
they
never
made
nor
were
asked
to
make
accounting
afterward
tiernan
would
receive
as
high
as
fifteen
and
eighteen
kerrigan
sometimes
as
much
as
twenty
to
thousand
dollars
his
being
the
pivotal
ward
under
such
circumstances
mckenty
had
recently
begun
to
recognize
that
these
two
men
would
soon
have
to
be
given
fuller
consideration
for
they
were
becoming
more
or
less
influential
but
how
their
personalities
let
alone
the
reputation
of
their
wards
and
the
methods
they
employed
were
not
such
as
to
command
public
confidence
in
the
mean
time
owing
to
the
tremendous
growth
of
the
city
the
growth
of
their
own
private
business
and
the
amount
of
stuffing
repeating
and
the
like
which
was
required
of
them
they
were
growing
more
and
more
restless
why
should
not
they
be
slated
for
higher
offices
they
now
frequently
asked
themselves
tiernan
would
have
been
delighted
to
have
been
nominated
for
sheriff
or
city
treasurer
he
considered
himself
eminently
qualified
kerrigan
at
the
last
city
convention
had
privately
urged
on
dowling
the
wisdom
of
nominating
him
for
the
position
of
commissioner
of
highways
and
sewers
which
office
he
was
anxious
to
obtain
because
of
its
reported
commercial
perquisites
but
this
year
of
all
times
owing
to
the
need
of
nominating
an
unblemished
ticket
to
defeat
the
sharp
republican
opposition
such
a
nomination
was
not
possible
it
would
have
drawn
the
fire
of
all
the
respectable
elements
in
the
city
as
a
result
both
tiernan
and
kerrigan
thinking
over
their
services
past
and
future
felt
very
much
disgruntled
they
were
really
not
large
enough
mentally
to
understand
how
dangerous
outside
of
certain
fields
of
activity
they
were
to
the
party
after
his
conference
with
hand
gilgan
going
about
the
city
with
the
promise
of
ready
cash
on
his
lips
was
able
to
arouse
considerable
enthusiasm
for
the
republican
cause
in
the
wards
and
sections
where
the
better
element
prevailed
it
seemed
probable
because
of
the
heavy
moral
teaching
of
the
newspapers
that
the
respectable
vote
would
array
itself
almost
solidly
this
time
against
cowperwood
in
the
poorer
wards
it
would
not
be
so
easy
true
it
was
possible
by
a
sufficient
outlay
of
cash
to
find
certain
hardy
bucaneers
who
could
be
induced
to
knife
their
own
brothers
but
the
result
was
not
certain
having
heard
through
one
person
and
another
of
the
disgruntled
mood
of
both
kerrigan
and
tiernan
and
recognizing
himself
even
if
he
was
a
republican
to
be
a
man
much
more
of
their
own
stripe
than
either
mckenty
or
dowling
gilgan
decided
to
visit
that
lusty
pair
and
see
what
could
be
done
by
way
of
alienating
them
from
the
present
center
of
power
after
due
reflection
he
first
sought
out
emerald
pat
kerrigan
whom
he
knew
personally
but
with
whom
he
was
by
no
means
intimate
politically
at
his
emporium
bar
in
dearborn
street
this
particular
saloon
a
feature
of
political
chicago
at
this
time
was
a
large
affair
containing
among
other
marvelous
saloon
fixtures
a
circular
bar
of
cherry
wood
twelve
feet
in
diameter
which
glowed
as
a
small
mountain
with
the
customary
plain
and
colored
glasses
bottles
labels
and
mirrors
the
floor
was
a
composition
of
small
shaded
marbles
the
ceiling
a
daub
of
pinky
fleshy
nudes
floating
among
diaphanous
clouds
the
walls
were
alternate
panels
of
cerise
and
brown
set
in
rosewood
kerrigan
when
other
duties
were
not
pressing
was
usually
to
be
found
standing
chatting
with
several
friends
and
surveying
the
wonders
of
his
bar
trade
which
was
very
large
on
the
day
of
gilgan
call
he
was
resplendent
in
a
suit
with
a
fine
red
stripe
in
it
cordovan
leather
shoes
a
tie
ornamented
with
the
emerald
of
so
much
renown
and
a
straw
hat
of
flaring
proportions
and
novel
weave
about
his
waist
in
lieu
of
a
waistcoat
was
fastened
one
of
the
eccentricities
of
the
day
a
manufactured
silk
sash
he
formed
an
interesting
contrast
with
gilgan
who
now
came
up
very
moist
pink
and
warm
in
a
fine
light
tweed
of
creamy
showy
texture
straw
hat
and
yellow
shoes
how
are
you
kerrigan
he
observed
genially
there
being
no
political
enmity
between
them
how
the
first
and
how
trade
i
see
you
have
lost
the
emerald
yet
no
no
danger
of
that
oh
trade
all
right
and
so
the
first
how
mr
gilgan
kerrigan
extended
his
hand
cordially
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
have
you
any
time
to
spare
for
answer
kerrigan
led
the
way
into
the
back
room
already
he
had
heard
rumors
of
a
strong
republican
opposition
at
the
coming
election
gilgan
sat
down
it
about
things
this
fall
i
come
to
see
you
of
course
he
began
smilingly
you
and
i
are
supposed
to
be
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fence
and
we
are
as
a
rule
but
i
am
wondering
whether
we
need
be
this
time
or
not
kerrigan
shrewd
though
seemingly
simple
fixed
him
with
an
amiable
eye
what
your
scheme
he
said
i
always
open
to
a
good
idea
well
it
just
this
began
gilgan
feeling
his
way
you
have
a
fine
big
ward
here
that
you
carry
in
your
vest
pocket
and
so
has
tiernan
as
we
all
know
and
we
all
know
too
that
if
it
was
for
what
you
and
him
can
do
there
would
always
be
a
democratic
mayor
elected
now
i
have
an
idea
from
looking
into
the
thing
that
neither
you
nor
tiernan
have
got
as
much
out
of
it
so
far
as
you
might
have
kerrigan
was
too
cautious
to
comment
as
to
that
though
gilgan
paused
for
a
moment
now
i
have
a
plan
as
i
say
and
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
just
as
you
want
and
no
hard
feelings
one
way
or
the
other
i
think
the
republicans
are
going
to
win
this
fall
mckenty
or
no
mckenty
first
second
and
third
wards
with
us
or
not
as
they
choose
the
doings
of
the
big
fellow
he
was
referring
to
mckenty
with
the
other
fellow
in
north
clark
street
gilgan
preferred
to
be
a
little
enigmatic
at
times
are
very
much
in
the
wind
just
now
you
see
how
the
papers
stand
i
happen
to
know
where
there
any
quantity
of
money
coming
into
the
game
from
big
financial
quarters
who
have
no
use
for
this
railroad
man
it
a
solid
la
salle
and
dearborn
street
so
far
as
i
can
see
why
i
do
know
but
so
it
is
maybe
you
know
better
than
i
do
anyhow
that
the
way
it
stands
now
add
to
that
the
fact
that
there
are
eight
naturally
republican
wards
as
it
is
and
ten
more
where
there
is
always
a
fighting
chance
and
you
begin
to
see
what
i
driving
at
count
out
these
last
ten
though
and
bet
only
on
the
eight
that
are
sure
to
stand
that
leaves
wards
that
we
republicans
always
conceded
to
you
people
but
if
we
manage
to
carry
thirteen
of
them
along
with
the
eight
i
talking
about
we
have
a
majority
in
council
and
flick
he
snapped
his
fingers
out
you
go
you
mckenty
cowperwood
and
all
the
rest
no
more
franchises
no
more
contracts
no
more
gas
deals
nothing
for
two
years
anyhow
and
maybe
longer
if
we
win
we
take
the
jobs
and
the
fat
deals
he
paused
and
surveyed
kerrigan
cheerfully
but
defiantly
now
i
just
been
all
over
the
city
he
continued
in
every
ward
and
precinct
so
i
know
something
of
what
i
am
talking
about
i
have
the
men
and
the
cash
to
put
up
a
fight
all
along
the
line
this
time
this
fall
we
win
me
and
the
big
fellows
over
there
in
la
salle
street
and
all
the
republicans
or
democrats
or
prohibitionists
or
whoever
else
comes
in
with
us
do
you
get
me
we
going
to
put
up
the
biggest
political
fight
chicago
has
ever
seen
i
not
naming
any
names
just
yet
but
when
the
time
comes
you
see
now
what
i
want
to
ask
of
you
is
this
and
i
not
mince
me
words
nor
beat
around
the
bush
will
you
and
tiernan
come
in
with
me
and
edstrom
to
take
over
the
city
and
run
it
during
the
next
two
years
if
you
will
we
can
win
hands
down
it
will
be
a
case
of
share
and
share
alike
on
everything
police
gas
water
highways
everything
or
we
divide
beforehand
and
put
it
down
in
black
and
white
i
know
that
you
and
tiernan
work
together
or
i
would
talk
about
this
edstrom
has
the
swedes
where
he
wants
them
and
he
poll
twenty
thousand
of
them
this
fall
there
ungerich
with
his
germans
one
of
us
might
make
a
deal
with
him
afterward
give
him
most
any
office
he
wants
if
we
win
this
time
we
can
hold
the
city
for
six
or
eight
years
anyhow
most
likely
and
after
that
well
there
no
use
lookin
too
far
in
the
future
anyhow
we
have
a
majority
of
the
council
and
carry
the
mayor
along
with
it
if
commented
kerrigan
dryly
if
replied
gilgan
sententiously
you
very
right
there
a
big
in
there
i
admit
but
if
these
two
wards
yours
and
tiernan
could
by
any
chance
be
carried
for
the
republicans
they
be
equal
to
any
four
or
five
of
the
others
very
true
replied
kerrigan
if
they
could
be
carried
for
the
republicans
but
they
ca
be
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
anyhow
lose
me
seat
in
council
and
be
run
out
of
the
democratic
party
your
game
you
do
take
me
for
a
plain
damn
fool
do
you
sorry
the
man
that
ever
took
pat
for
that
answered
gilgan
with
honeyed
compliment
i
never
would
but
no
one
is
askin
ye
to
lose
your
seat
in
council
and
be
run
out
of
the
democratic
party
what
to
hinder
you
from
electin
yourself
and
droppin
the
rest
of
the
ticket
he
had
almost
said
knifing
kerrigan
smiled
in
spite
of
all
his
previous
dissatisfaction
with
the
chicago
situation
he
had
not
thought
of
gilgan
talk
as
leading
to
this
it
was
an
interesting
idea
he
had
knifed
people
before
here
and
there
a
particular
candidate
whom
it
was
desirable
to
undo
if
the
democratic
party
was
in
any
danger
of
losing
this
fall
and
if
gilgan
was
honest
in
his
desire
to
divide
and
control
it
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
neither
cowperwood
mckenty
nor
dowling
had
ever
favored
him
in
any
particular
way
if
they
lost
through
him
and
he
could
still
keep
himself
in
power
they
would
have
to
make
terms
with
him
there
was
no
chance
of
their
running
him
out
why
he
knife
the
ticket
it
was
worth
thinking
over
to
say
the
least
that
all
very
fine
he
observed
dryly
after
his
meditations
had
run
their
course
but
how
do
i
know
that
you
would
turn
around
and
on
the
agreement
afterward
gilgan
stirred
irritably
at
the
suggestion
dave
morrissey
came
to
me
four
years
ago
to
help
him
out
and
a
lot
of
satisfaction
i
got
afterward
kerrigan
was
referring
to
a
man
whom
he
had
helped
make
county
clerk
and
who
had
turned
on
him
when
he
asked
for
return
favors
and
his
support
for
the
office
of
commissioner
of
highways
morrissey
had
become
a
prominent
politician
that
very
easy
to
say
replied
gilgan
irritably
but
it
not
true
of
me
ask
any
man
in
my
district
ask
the
men
who
know
me
i
put
my
part
of
the
bargain
in
black
and
white
if
you
put
yours
if
i
do
make
good
show
me
up
afterward
i
take
you
to
the
people
that
are
backing
me
i
show
you
the
money
i
got
the
goods
this
time
what
do
you
stand
to
lose
anyhow
they
ca
run
you
out
for
cutting
the
ticket
they
ca
prove
it
we
bring
police
in
here
to
make
it
look
like
a
fair
vote
i
put
up
as
much
money
as
they
will
to
carry
this
district
and
more
kerrigan
suddenly
saw
a
grand
coup
here
he
could
draw
down
from
the
democrats
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
twenty
to
thousand
dollars
to
do
the
dirty
work
here
gilgan
would
furnish
him
as
much
and
more
the
situation
being
so
critical
perhaps
fifteen
or
eighteen
thousand
would
be
necessary
to
poll
the
number
of
votes
required
either
way
at
the
last
hour
before
stuffing
the
boxes
he
would
learn
how
the
city
was
going
if
it
looked
favorable
for
the
republicans
it
would
be
easy
to
complete
the
victory
and
complain
that
his
lieutenants
had
been
suborned
if
it
looked
certain
for
the
democrats
he
could
throw
gilgan
and
pocket
his
funds
in
either
case
he
would
be
in
to
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
he
would
still
be
councilman
all
very
fine
replied
kerrigan
pretending
a
dullness
which
he
did
not
feel
but
it
damned
ticklish
business
at
best
i
do
know
that
i
want
anything
to
do
with
it
even
if
we
could
win
it
true
the
city
hall
crowd
have
never
played
into
my
hands
very
much
but
this
is
a
democratic
district
and
i
a
democrat
if
it
ever
got
out
that
i
had
thrown
the
party
it
would
be
pretty
near
all
day
with
me
i
a
man
of
my
word
declared
gilgan
emphatically
getting
up
i
never
threw
a
man
or
a
bet
in
my
life
look
at
me
record
in
the
eighteenth
did
you
ever
hear
any
one
say
that
i
had
no
i
never
did
returned
kerrigan
mildly
but
it
a
pretty
large
thing
you
proposing
gilgan
i
would
want
to
say
what
i
thought
about
it
offhand
this
ward
is
supposed
to
be
democratic
it
could
be
swung
over
into
the
republican
column
without
a
good
bit
of
fuss
being
made
about
it
you
better
see
tiernan
first
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
afterward
i
might
be
willing
to
talk
about
it
further
not
now
though
not
now
gilgan
went
away
quite
jauntily
and
cheerfully
he
was
not
at
all
downcast
chapter
xxxvi
an
election
draws
near
subsequently
kerrigan
called
on
tiernan
casually
tiernan
returned
the
call
a
little
later
tiernan
kerrigan
and
gilgan
in
a
in
a
small
hotel
in
milwaukee
in
order
not
to
be
seen
together
conferred
finally
tiernan
edstrom
kerrigan
and
gilgan
met
and
mapped
out
a
programme
of
division
far
too
intricate
to
be
indicated
here
needless
to
say
it
involved
the
division
of
chief
clerks
pro
rata
of
police
graft
of
gambling
and
perquisites
of
returns
from
gas
and
other
organizations
it
was
sealed
with
many
solemn
promises
if
it
could
be
made
effective
this
quadrumvirate
was
to
endure
for
years
judges
small
magistrates
officers
large
and
small
the
shrievalty
the
water
office
the
tax
office
all
were
to
come
within
its
purview
it
was
a
fine
handsome
political
dream
and
as
such
worthy
of
every
courtesy
and
consideration
but
it
was
only
a
political
dream
in
its
ultimate
aspects
and
as
such
impressed
the
participants
themselves
at
times
the
campaign
was
now
in
full
blast
the
summer
and
fall
september
and
october
went
by
to
the
tune
of
democratic
and
republican
marching
club
bands
to
the
sound
of
lusty
political
voices
orating
in
parks
at
in
wooden
wigwams
halls
tents
and
parlors
wherever
a
meager
handful
of
listeners
could
be
drummed
up
and
made
by
any
device
to
keep
still
the
newspapers
honked
and
bellowed
as
is
the
way
with
those
advocates
and
guardians
of
right
and
justice
cowperwood
and
mckenty
were
denounced
from
nearly
every
in
chicago
wagons
and
on
wheels
were
hauled
about
labeled
break
the
partnership
between
the
corporations
and
the
city
council
do
you
want
more
streets
stolen
do
you
want
cowperwood
to
own
chicago
cowperwood
himself
coming
of
a
morning
or
driving
home
of
an
evening
saw
these
things
he
saw
the
huge
signs
listened
to
speeches
denouncing
himself
and
smiled
by
now
he
was
quite
aware
as
to
whence
this
powerful
uprising
had
sprung
hand
was
back
of
it
he
knew
for
so
mckenty
and
addison
had
quickly
discovered
and
with
hand
was
schryhart
arneel
merrill
the
douglas
trust
company
the
various
editors
young
truman
leslie
macdonald
the
old
gas
crowd
the
chicago
general
company
all
he
even
suspected
that
certain
aldermen
might
possibly
be
suborned
to
desert
him
though
all
professed
loyalty
mckenty
addison
videra
and
himself
were
planning
the
details
of
their
defenses
as
carefully
and
effectively
as
possible
cowperwood
was
fully
alive
to
the
fact
that
if
he
lost
this
election
the
first
to
be
vigorously
contested
it
might
involve
a
serious
chain
of
events
but
he
did
not
propose
to
be
unduly
disturbed
since
he
could
always
fight
in
the
courts
by
money
and
by
preferment
in
the
council
and
with
the
mayor
and
the
city
attorney
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
kill
a
cat
was
one
of
his
pet
expressions
and
it
expressed
his
logic
and
courage
exactly
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
lose
one
of
the
amusing
features
of
the
campaign
was
that
the
mckenty
orators
had
been
instructed
to
shout
as
loudly
for
reforms
as
the
republicans
only
instead
of
assailing
cowperwood
and
mckenty
they
were
to
point
out
that
schryhart
chicago
city
railway
was
far
more
rapacious
and
that
this
was
a
scheme
to
give
it
a
blanket
franchise
of
all
streets
not
yet
covered
by
either
the
cowperwood
or
the
lines
it
was
a
pretty
argument
the
democrats
could
point
with
pride
to
a
uniformly
liberal
interpretation
of
some
trying
sunday
laws
whereby
under
republican
and
reform
administrations
it
had
been
occasionally
difficult
for
the
honest
to
get
his
glass
or
pail
of
beer
on
sunday
on
the
other
hand
it
was
possible
for
the
republican
orators
to
show
how
the
low
dives
and
were
everywhere
being
operated
in
favor
of
mckenty
and
that
under
the
highly
respectable
administration
of
the
republican
candidate
for
mayor
this
partnership
between
the
city
government
and
vice
and
crime
would
be
nullified
if
i
am
elected
declared
the
honorable
chaffee
thayer
sluss
the
republican
candidate
neither
frank
cowperwood
nor
john
mckenty
will
dare
to
show
his
face
in
the
city
hall
unless
he
comes
with
clean
hands
and
an
honest
purpose
hooray
yelled
the
crowd
i
know
that
ass
commented
addison
when
he
read
this
in
the
transcript
he
used
to
be
a
clerk
in
the
douglas
trust
company
made
a
little
money
recently
in
the
paper
business
he
a
mere
tool
for
the
interests
he
has
the
courage
of
a
when
mckenty
read
it
he
simply
observed
there
are
other
ways
of
going
to
city
hall
than
by
going
yourself
he
was
depending
upon
a
councilmanic
majority
at
least
however
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
the
goings
to
and
fro
of
gilgan
edstrom
kerrigan
and
tiernan
were
nor
fully
grasped
a
more
urbanely
shifty
pair
than
these
latter
were
never
seen
while
fraternizing
secretly
with
both
gilgan
and
edstrom
laying
out
their
political
programme
most
neatly
they
were
at
the
same
time
conferring
with
dowling
duvanicki
even
mckenty
himself
seeing
that
the
outcome
was
for
some
reason
he
could
scarcely
see
why
looking
very
uncertain
mckenty
one
day
asked
the
two
of
them
to
come
to
see
him
on
getting
the
letter
tiernan
strolled
over
to
kerrigan
place
to
see
whether
he
also
had
received
a
message
sure
sure
i
did
replied
kerrigan
gaily
here
it
is
now
in
me
outside
coat
pocket
kerrigan
he
read
you
do
me
the
favor
to
come
over
evening
at
seven
and
dine
with
me
ungerich
duvanicki
and
several
others
will
very
likely
drop
in
afterward
i
have
asked
tiernan
to
come
at
the
same
time
sincerely
john
j
mckenty
that
the
way
he
does
it
added
kerrigan
just
like
that
he
kissed
the
letter
mockingly
and
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
sure
i
got
one
jist
the
same
way
the
very
same
langwidge
nearly
commented
tiernan
sweetly
he
beginning
to
wake
up
eh
what
the
little
old
first
and
second
are
beginning
to
look
purty
big
just
now
eh
what
tush
observed
kerrigan
to
tiernan
with
a
marked
sardonic
emphasis
that
combination
wo
last
forever
they
been
getting
too
big
for
their
pants
i
thinking
well
it
a
long
road
eh
it
pretty
near
time
what
you
right
responded
tiernan
feelingly
it
is
a
long
road
these
are
the
two
big
wards
of
the
city
and
everybody
knows
it
if
we
turn
on
them
at
the
last
moment
where
will
they
be
eh
he
put
a
fat
finger
alongside
of
his
heavy
reddish
nose
and
looked
at
kerrigan
out
of
squinted
eyes
you
damned
right
replied
the
little
politician
cheerfully
they
went
to
the
dinner
separately
so
as
not
to
appear
to
have
conferred
before
and
greeted
each
other
on
arriving
as
though
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
days
how
business
mike
oh
fair
pat
how
things
with
you
so
so
things
lookin
all
right
in
your
ward
for
november
tiernan
wrinkled
a
fat
forehead
ca
tell
yet
all
this
was
for
the
benefit
of
mckenty
who
did
not
suspect
rank
party
disloyalty
nothing
much
came
of
this
conference
except
that
they
sat
about
discussing
in
a
general
way
wards
pluralities
what
zeigler
was
likely
to
do
with
the
twelfth
whether
pinski
could
make
it
in
the
sixth
schlumbohm
in
the
twentieth
and
so
on
new
republican
contestants
in
old
safe
democratic
wards
were
making
things
look
dubious
and
how
about
the
first
kerrigan
inquired
ungerich
a
thin
reflective
of
shrewd
presence
ungerich
was
one
who
had
hitherto
wormed
himself
higher
in
mckenty
favor
than
either
kerrigan
or
tiernan
oh
the
first
all
right
replied
kerrigan
archly
of
course
you
never
can
tell
this
fellow
scully
may
do
something
but
i
do
think
it
will
be
much
if
we
have
the
same
police
protection
ungerich
was
gratified
he
was
having
a
struggle
in
his
own
ward
where
a
rival
by
the
name
of
glover
appeared
to
be
pouring
out
money
like
water
he
would
require
considerably
more
money
than
usual
to
win
it
was
the
same
with
duvanicki
mckenty
finally
parted
with
his
lieutenants
more
feelingly
with
kerrigan
and
tiernan
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
did
not
wholly
trust
these
two
and
he
could
not
exactly
admire
them
and
their
methods
which
were
the
roughest
of
all
but
they
were
useful
i
glad
to
learn
he
said
at
parting
that
things
are
looking
all
right
with
you
pat
and
you
mike
nodding
to
each
in
turn
going
to
need
the
most
we
can
get
out
of
everybody
i
depend
on
you
two
to
make
a
fine
showing
the
best
of
any
the
rest
of
us
will
not
forget
it
when
the
plums
are
being
handed
around
afterward
oh
you
can
depend
on
me
to
do
the
best
i
can
always
commented
kerrigan
sympathetically
it
a
tough
year
but
we
have
failed
yet
and
me
chief
that
goes
for
me
observed
tiernan
raucously
i
guess
i
can
do
as
well
as
i
have
good
for
you
mike
soothed
mckenty
laying
a
gentle
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
you
too
kerrigan
yours
are
the
key
wards
and
we
understand
that
i
always
been
sorry
that
the
leaders
agree
on
you
two
for
something
better
than
councilmen
but
next
time
there
wo
be
any
doubt
of
it
if
i
have
any
influence
then
he
went
in
and
closed
the
door
outside
a
cool
october
wind
was
whipping
dead
leaves
and
weed
stalks
along
the
pavements
neither
tiernan
nor
kerrigan
spoke
though
they
had
come
away
together
until
they
were
two
hundred
feet
down
the
avenue
toward
van
buren
some
talk
that
eh
commented
tiernan
eying
kerrigan
in
the
flare
of
a
passing
sure
that
the
stuff
they
always
hand
out
when
they
up
against
it
pretty
kind
words
eh
and
after
ten
years
of
about
the
roughest
work
that
done
eh
about
time
what
say
it
a
wonder
he
did
think
of
that
last
june
when
the
convention
was
in
session
tush
mikey
smiled
kerrigan
grimly
you
a
bad
little
boy
you
want
your
pie
too
soon
wait
another
two
or
four
or
six
years
like
paddy
kerrigan
and
the
others
yes
i
will
not
growled
tiernan
wait
the
sixth
no
more
will
i
replied
kerrigan
say
we
know
a
trick
that
beats
that
business
to
a
pulp
what
you
dead
right
commented
tiernan
and
so
they
went
peacefully
home
chapter
xxxvii
aileen
revenge
the
interesting
polk
lynde
rising
one
morning
decided
that
his
affair
with
aileen
sympathetic
as
it
was
must
culminate
in
the
one
fashion
satisfactory
to
him
here
and
now
this
day
if
possible
or
the
next
since
the
luncheon
some
considerable
time
had
elapsed
and
although
he
had
tried
to
seek
her
out
in
various
ways
aileen
owing
to
a
certain
feeling
that
she
must
think
and
not
jeopardize
her
future
had
evaded
him
she
realized
well
enough
that
she
was
at
the
turning
of
the
balance
now
that
opportunity
was
knocking
so
loudly
at
her
door
and
she
was
exceedingly
coy
and
distrait
in
spite
of
herself
the
old
grip
of
cowperwood
was
over
her
the
conviction
that
he
was
such
a
tremendous
figure
in
the
world
and
this
made
her
strangely
disturbed
nebulous
and
meditative
another
type
of
woman
having
troubled
as
much
as
she
had
done
would
have
made
short
work
of
it
particularly
since
the
details
in
regard
to
hand
had
been
added
not
so
aileen
she
could
not
quite
forget
the
early
vows
and
promises
exchanged
between
them
nor
conquer
the
illusions
that
he
might
still
behave
himself
on
the
other
hand
polk
lynde
marauder
social
adventurer
a
bucaneer
of
the
affections
was
not
so
easily
to
be
put
aside
delayed
and
gainsaid
not
unlike
cowperwood
he
was
a
man
of
real
force
and
his
methods
in
so
far
as
women
were
concerned
were
even
more
daring
long
trifling
with
the
sex
had
taught
him
that
they
were
coy
uncertain
foolishly
inconsistent
in
their
moods
even
with
regard
to
what
they
most
desired
if
one
contemplated
victory
it
had
frequently
to
be
taken
with
an
iron
hand
from
this
attitude

his
part

sprung
his
rather
dark
fame
aileen

it
on
the
day
that
she
took
lunch
with
him
his
solemn
dark
eyes
were
treacherously
sweet
she
felt
as
if
she
might
be
paving
the
way
for
some
situation
in
which
she
would
find
herself
helpless
before
his
sudden
mood
and
yet
she
had
come
but
lynde
meditating
aileen
delay
had
this
day
decided
that
he
should
get
a
definite
decision
and
that
it
should
be
favorable
he
called
her
up
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
chafed
her
concerning
her
indecision
and
changeable
moods
he
wanted
to
know
whether
she
would
not
come
and
see
the
paintings
at
his
friend
studio
whether
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
come
to
a
which
some
bachelor
friends
of
his
had
arranged
when
she
pleaded
being
out
of
sorts
he
urged
her
to
pull
herself
together
you
making
things
very
difficult
for
your
admirers
he
suggested
sweetly
aileen
fancied
she
had
postponed
the
struggle
diplomatically
for
some
little
time
without
ending
it
when
at
two
in
the
afternoon
her
was
rung
and
the
name
of
lynde
brought
up
he
said
he
was
sure
you
were
in
commented
the
footman
on
whom
had
been
pressed
a
dollar
and
would
you
see
him
for
just
a
moment
he
would
not
keep
you
more
than
a
moment
aileen
taken
off
her
guard
by
this
effrontery
uncertain
as
to
whether
there
might
not
be
something
of
some
slight
import
concerning
which
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
quarreling
with
herself
because
of
her
indecision
really
fascinated
by
lynde
as
a
rival
for
her
affections
and
remembering
his
jesting
coaxing
voice
of
the
morning
decided
to
go
down
she
was
lonely
and
clad
in
a
lavender
housegown
with
an
ermine
collar
and
sleeve
cuffs
was
reading
a
book
show
him
into
the
she
said
to
the
lackey
when
she
entered
she
was
breathing
with
some
slight
difficulty
for
so
lynde
affected
her
she
knew
she
had
displayed
fear
by
not
going
to
him
before
and
previous
cowardice
plainly
manifested
does
not
add
to
power
of
resistance
oh
she
exclaimed
with
an
assumption
of
bravado
which
she
did
not
feel
i
did
expect
to
see
you
so
soon
after
your
telephone
message
you
have
never
been
in
our
house
before
have
you
wo
you
put
up
your
coat
and
hat
and
come
into
the
gallery
it
brighter
there
and
you
might
be
interested
in
some
of
the
pictures
lynde
who
was
seeking
for
any
pretext
whereby
he
might
prolong
his
stay
and
overcome
her
nervous
mood
accepted
pretending
however
that
he
was
merely
passing
and
with
a
moment
to
spare
thought
i
get
just
one
glimpse
of
you
again
could
resist
the
temptation
to
look
in
stunning
room
is
it
spacious
and
there
you
are
who
did
that
oh
i
see
van
beers
and
a
jolly
fine
piece
of
work
it
is
too
charming
he
surveyed
her
and
then
turned
back
to
the
picture
where
ten
years
younger
buoyant
hopeful
carrying
her
striped
parasol
she
sat
on
a
stone
bench
against
the
dutch
background
of
sky
and
clouds
charmed
by
the
picture
she
presented
in
both
cases
he
was
genially
complimentary
she
was
stouter
ruddier
the
fiber
of
her
had
hardened
as
it
does
with
so
many
as
the
years
come
on
but
she
was
still
in
full
bloom
a
little
late
in
the
summer
but
in
full
bloom
oh
yes
and
this
rembrandt
i
surprised
i
did
not
know
your
husband
collection
was
so
representative
israels
i
see
and
gerome
and
meissonier
gad
it
is
a
representative
collection
it
some
of
the
things
are
excellent
she
commented
with
an
air
aping
cowperwood
and
others
but
a
number
will
be
weeded
out
eventually
that
paul
potter
and
this
goy
as
better
examples
come
into
the
market
she
had
heard
cowperwood
say
as
much
over
and
over
finding
that
conversation
was
possible
between
them
in
this
easy
impersonal
way
aileen
became
quite
natural
and
interested
pleased
and
entertained
by
his
discreet
and
charming
presence
evidently
he
did
not
intend
to
pay
much
more
than
a
passing
social
call
on
the
other
hand
lynde
was
studying
her
wondering
what
effect
his
light
distant
air
was
having
as
he
finished
a
very
casual
survey
of
the
gallery
he
remarked
i
have
always
wondered
about
this
house
i
knew
lord
did
it
of
course
and
i
always
heard
it
was
well
done
that
is
the
i
suppose
aileen
who
had
always
been
inordinately
vain
of
the
house
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
had
proved
of
small
use
socially
was
delighted
to
show
him
the
remainder
of
the
rooms
lynde
who
was
used
of
course
to
houses
of
all
degrees
of
material
splendor
that
of
his
own
family
being
one
of
the
best
pretended
an
interest
he
did
not
feel
he
commented
as
he
went
on
the
taste
of
the
decorations
and
the
charm
of
the
arrangement
that
permitted
neat
brief
vistas
and
the
like
just
wait
a
moment
said
aileen
as
they
neared
the
door
of
her
own
boudoir
i
forgotten
whether
mine
is
in
order
i
want
you
to
see
that
she
opened
it
and
stepped
in
yes
you
may
come
she
called
he
followed
oh
yes
indeed
very
charming
very
graceful
those
little
lacy
dancing
figures
are
they
a
delightful
color
scheme
it
harmonizes
with
you
exactly
it
is
quite
like
you
he
paused
looking
at
the
spacious
rug
which
was
of
warm
blues
and
creams
and
at
the
gilt
ormolu
bed
well
done
he
said
and
then
suddenly
changing
his
mood
and
dropping
his
talk
of
decoration
aileen
was
to
his
right
and
he
was
between
her
and
the
door
he
added
tell
me
now
why
wo
you
come
to
the
it
would
be
charming
you
will
enjoy
it
aileen
saw
the
sudden
change
in
his
mood
she
recognized
that
by
showing
him
the
rooms
she
had
led
herself
into
an
easily
made
disturbing
position
his
dark
engaging
eyes
told
their
own
story
oh
i
do
feel
in
the
mood
to
i
have
for
a
number
of
things
for
some
time
i
she
began
to
move
unconcernedly
about
him
toward
the
door
but
he
detained
her
with
his
hand
do
go
just
yet
he
said
let
me
talk
to
you
you
always
evade
me
in
such
a
nervous
way
do
you
like
me
at
all
oh
yes
i
like
you
but
ca
we
talk
just
as
well
down
in
the
as
here
ca
i
tell
you
why
i
evade
you
down
there
just
as
well
as
i
can
here
she
smiled
a
winning
and
now
fearless
smile
lynde
showed
his
even
white
teeth
in
two
gleaming
rows
his
eyes
filled
with
a
gay
maliciousness
surely
surely
he
replied
but
you
so
nice
in
your
own
room
here
i
hate
to
leave
it
just
the
same
replied
aileen
still
gay
but
now
slightly
disturbed
also
i
think
we
might
as
well
you
will
find
me
just
as
entertaining
downstairs
she
moved
but
his
strength
quite
as
cowperwood
was
much
too
great
for
her
he
was
a
strong
man
really
you
know
she
said
you
must
act
this
way
here
some
one
might
come
in
what
cause
have
i
given
you
to
make
you
think
you
could
do
like
this
with
me
what
cause
he
asked
bending
over
her
and
smoothing
her
plump
arms
with
his
brown
hands
oh
no
definite
cause
perhaps
you
are
a
cause
in
yourself
i
told
you
how
sweet
i
thought
you
were
the
night
we
were
at
the
alcott
did
you
understand
then
i
thought
you
did
oh
i
understood
that
you
liked
me
and
all
that
perhaps
any
one
might
do
that
but
as
for
anything
like
well
taking
such
liberties
with
me
i
never
dreamed
of
it
but
listen
i
think
i
hear
some
one
coming
aileen
making
a
sudden
vigorous
effort
to
free
herself
and
failing
added
please
let
me
go
lynde
it
is
very
gallant
of
you
i
must
say
restraining
a
woman
against
her
will
if
i
had
given
you
any
real
cause
i
shall
be
angry
in
a
moment
again
the
even
smiling
teeth
and
dark
wrinkling
malicious
eyes
really
how
you
go
on
you
would
think
i
was
a
perfect
stranger
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
at
lunch
you
did
keep
your
promise
you
practically
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
would
come
why
did
you
are
you
afraid
of
me
or
do
you
like
me
or
both
i
think
you
delicious
splendid
and
i
want
to
know
he
shifted
his
position
putting
one
arm
about
her
waist
pulling
her
close
to
him
looking
into
her
eyes
with
the
other
he
held
her
free
arm
suddenly
he
covered
her
mouth
with
his
and
then
kissed
her
cheeks
you
care
for
me
do
you
what
did
you
mean
by
saying
you
might
come
if
you
did
he
held
her
quite
firm
while
aileen
struggled
it
was
a
new
sensation
this
that
of
the
other
man
and
this
was
polk
lynde
the
first
individual
outside
of
cowperwood
to
whom
she
had
ever
felt
drawn
but
now
here
in
her
own
room
and
it
was
within
the
range
of
possibilities
that
cowperwood
might
return
or
the
servants
enter
oh
but
think
what
you
are
doing
she
protested
not
really
disturbed
as
yet
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
contest
with
him
and
feeling
as
though
he
were
merely
trying
to
make
her
be
sweet
to
him
without
intending
anything
more
at
present
here
in
my
own
room
really
you
not
the
man
i
thought
you
were
at
all
if
you
do
instantly
let
me
go
lynde
mr
lynde
he
had
bent
over
and
was
kissing
her
oh
you
should
do
this
really
i
i
said
i
might
come
but
that
was
far
from
doing
it
and
to
have
you
come
here
and
take
advantage
of
me
in
this
way
i
think
you
horrid
if
i
ever
had
any
interest
in
you
it
is
quite
dead
now
i
can
assure
you
unless
you
let
me
go
at
once
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
never
see
you
any
more
i
wo
really
i
wo
i
mean
it
oh
please
let
me
go
i
scream
i
tell
you
never
see
you
again
after
this
day
oh
it
was
an
intense
but
useless
struggle
coming
home
one
evening
about
a
week
later
cowperwood
found
aileen
humming
cheerfully
and
yet
also
in
a
seemingly
deep
and
reflective
mood
she
was
just
completing
an
evening
toilet
and
looked
young
and
colorful
quite
her
avid
seeking
self
of
earlier
days
well
he
asked
cheerfully
how
have
things
gone
aileen
feeling
somehow
as
one
will
on
occasions
that
if
she
had
done
wrong
she
was
justified
and
that
sometime
because
of
this
she
might
even
win
cowperwood
back
felt
somewhat
kindlier
toward
him
oh
very
well
she
replied
i
stopped
in
at
the
hoecksemas
this
afternoon
for
a
little
while
they
going
to
mexico
in
november
she
has
the
darlingest
new
if
she
only
looked
like
anything
when
she
rode
in
it
etta
is
getting
ready
to
enter
bryn
mawr
she
is
all
fussed
up
about
leaving
her
dog
and
cat
then
i
went
down
to
one
of
lane
cross
receptions
and
over
to
merrill
she
was
referring
to
the
great
store
and
home
i
saw
taylor
lord
and
polk
lynde
together
in
wabash
avenue
polk
lynde
commented
cowperwood
is
he
interesting
yes
he
is
replied
aileen
i
never
met
a
man
with
such
perfect
manners
he
so
fascinating
he
just
like
a
boy
and
yet
heaven
knows
he
seems
to
have
had
enough
worldly
experience
so
i
heard
commented
cowperwood
was
he
the
one
that
was
mixed
up
in
that
carmen
torriba
case
here
a
few
years
ago
cowperwood
was
referring
to
the
matter
of
a
spanish
dancer
traveling
in
america
with
whom
lynde
had
been
apparently
desperately
in
love
oh
yes
replied
aileen
maliciously
but
that
ought
to
make
any
difference
to
you
he
charming
anyhow
i
like
him
i
did
say
it
did
did
i
you
do
object
to
my
mentioning
a
mere
incident
oh
i
know
about
the
incident
replied
aileen
jestingly
i
know
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
asked
studying
her
face
oh
i
know
you
she
replied
sweetly
and
yet
defensively
you
think
i
stay
here
and
be
content
while
you
run
about
with
other
women
play
the
sweet
and
loving
wife
well
i
wo
i
know
why
you
say
this
about
lynde
it
to
keep
me
from
being
interested
in
him
possibly
well
i
will
be
if
i
want
to
i
told
you
i
would
be
and
i
will
you
can
do
what
you
please
about
that
you
do
want
me
so
why
should
you
be
disturbed
as
to
whether
other
men
are
interested
in
me
or
not
the
truth
was
that
cowperwood
was
not
clearly
thinking
of
any
probable
relation
between
lynde
and
aileen
any
more
than
he
was
in
connection
with
her
and
any
other
man
and
yet
in
a
remote
way
he
was
sensing
some
one
it
was
this
that
aileen
felt
in
him
and
that
brought
forth
her
seemingly
comment
cowperwood
under
the
circumstances
attempted
to
be
as
suave
as
possible
having
caught
the
implication
clearly
aileen
he
cooed
how
you
talk
why
do
you
say
that
you
know
i
care
for
you
i
ca
prevent
anything
you
want
to
do
and
i
sure
you
know
i
do
want
to
it
you
that
i
want
to
see
satisfied
you
know
that
i
care
yes
i
know
how
you
care
replied
aileen
her
mood
changing
for
the
moment
do
start
that
old
stuff
please
i
sick
of
it
i
know
how
you
running
around
i
know
about
hand
even
the
newspapers
make
that
plain
you
been
home
just
one
evening
in
the
last
eight
days
long
enough
for
me
to
get
more
than
a
glimpse
of
you
do
talk
to
me
do
try
to
bill
and
coo
i
always
known
think
i
do
know
who
your
latest
flame
is
but
do
begin
to
whine
and
do
quarrel
with
me
if
i
go
about
and
get
interested
in
other
men
as
i
certainly
will
it
will
be
all
your
fault
if
i
do
and
you
know
it
do
begin
and
complain
it
wo
do
you
any
good
i
not
going
to
sit
here
and
be
made
a
fool
of
i
told
you
that
over
and
over
you
do
believe
it
but
i
not
i
told
you
that
i
find
some
one
one
of
these
days
and
i
will
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
already
at
this
remark
cowperwood
surveyed
her
coolly
critically
and
yet
not
unsympathetically
but
she
swung
out
of
the
room
with
a
defiant
air
before
anything
could
be
said
and
went
down
to
the
from
whence
a
few
moments
later
there
rolled
up
to
him
from
the
hall
below
the
strains
of
the
second
hungarian
rhapsodie
feelingly
and
for
once
movingly
played
into
it
aileen
put
some
of
her
own
wild
woe
and
misery
cowperwood
hated
the
thought
for
the
moment
that
some
one
as
smug
as
lynde
so
so
suave
a
society
rake
should
interest
aileen
but
if
it
must
be
it
must
be
he
could
have
no
honest
reason
for
complaint
at
the
same
time
a
breath
of
real
sorrow
for
the
days
that
had
gone
swept
over
him
he
remembered
her
in
philadelphia
in
her
red
cape
as
a
in
his
house
out
driving
what
a
splendid
loving
girl
she
had
been
such
a
sweet
fool
of
love
could
she
really
have
decided
not
to
worry
about
him
any
more
could
it
be
possible
that
she
might
find
some
one
else
who
would
be
interested
in
her
and
in
whom
she
would
take
a
keen
interest
it
was
an
odd
thought
for
him
he
watched
her
as
she
came
into
the
later
arrayed
in
green
silk
of
the
shade
of
copper
patina
her
hair
done
in
a
high
coil
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
help
admiring
her
she
looked
very
young
in
her
soul
and
yet
moody
loving
for
some
one
eager
and
defiant
he
reflected
for
a
moment
what
terrible
things
passion
and
love
are
how
they
make
fools
of
us
all
all
of
us
are
in
the
grip
of
a
great
creative
impulse
he
said
to
himself
he
talked
of
other
things
for
a
while
the
approaching
election
a
he
had
seen
bearing
the
question
shall
cowperwood
own
the
city
pretty
cheap
politics
i
call
that
he
commented
and
then
he
told
of
stopping
in
a
republican
wigwam
at
state
and
sixteenth
streets
a
great
cheaply
erected
unpainted
wooden
shack
with
seats
and
of
hearing
himself
bitterly
denounced
by
the
reigning
orator
i
was
tempted
once
to
ask
that
donkey
a
few
questions
he
added
but
i
decided
i
would
aileen
had
to
smile
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
he
was
such
a
wonderful
man
to
set
a
city
thus
by
the
ears
yet
what
care
i
how
fair
he
be
if
he
be
not
fair
to
me
did
you
meet
any
one
else
besides
lynde
you
liked
he
finally
asked
archly
seeking
to
gather
further
data
without
stirring
up
too
much
feeling
aileen
who
had
been
studying
him
feeling
sure
the
subject
would
come
up
again
replied
no
i
have
but
i
do
need
to
one
is
enough
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
asked
gently
oh
just
what
i
say
one
will
do
you
mean
you
are
in
love
with
lynde
i
mean
oh
she
stopped
and
surveyed
him
defiantly
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
what
i
mean
yes
i
am
but
what
do
you
care
why
do
you
sit
there
and
question
me
it
does
make
any
difference
to
you
what
i
do
you
do
want
me
why
should
you
sit
there
and
try
to
find
out
or
watch
it
has
been
any
consideration
for
you
that
has
restrained
me
so
far
suppose
i
am
in
love
what
difference
would
it
make
to
you
oh
i
care
you
know
i
care
why
do
you
say
that
yes
you
care
she
flared
i
know
how
you
care
well
i
just
tell
you
one
thing
rage
at
his
indifference
was
driving
her
on
i
am
in
love
with
lynde
and
what
more
i
his
mistress
and
continue
to
be
but
what
do
you
care
pshaw
her
eyes
blazed
hotly
her
color
rose
high
and
strong
she
breathed
heavily
at
this
announcement
made
in
the
heat
of
spite
and
rage
generated
by
long
indifference
cowperwood
sat
up
for
a
moment
and
his
eyes
hardened
with
quite
that
implacable
glare
with
which
he
sometimes
confronted
an
enemy
he
felt
at
once
there
were
many
things
he
could
do
to
make
her
life
miserable
and
to
take
revenge
on
lynde
but
he
decided
after
a
moment
he
would
not
it
was
not
weakness
but
a
sense
of
superior
power
that
was
moving
him
why
should
he
be
jealous
had
he
not
been
unkind
enough
in
a
moment
his
mood
changed
to
one
of
sorrow
for
aileen
for
himself
for
life
indeed
its
tangles
of
desire
and
necessity
he
could
not
blame
aileen
lynde
was
surely
attractive
he
had
no
desire
to
part
with
her
or
to
quarrel
with
him
merely
to
temporarily
cease
all
intimate
relations
with
her
and
allow
her
mood
to
clear
itself
up
perhaps
she
would
want
to
leave
him
of
her
own
accord
perhaps
if
he
ever
found
the
right
woman
this
might
prove
good
grounds
for
his
leaving
her
the
right
woman
where
was
she
he
had
never
found
her
yet
aileen
he
said
quite
softly
i
wish
you
would
feel
so
bitterly
about
this
why
should
you
when
did
you
do
this
will
you
tell
me
that
no
i
not
tell
you
that
she
replied
bitterly
it
none
of
your
affair
and
i
not
tell
you
why
should
you
ask
you
care
but
i
do
care
i
tell
you
he
returned
irritably
almost
roughly
when
did
you
you
can
tell
me
that
at
least
his
eyes
had
a
hard
cold
look
for
the
moment
dying
away
though
into
kindly
inquiry
oh
not
long
ago
about
a
week
aileen
answered
as
though
she
were
compelled
how
long
have
you
known
him
he
asked
curiously
oh
four
or
five
months
now
i
met
him
last
winter
and
did
you
do
this
deliberately
because
you
were
in
love
with
him
or
because
you
wanted
to
hurt
me
he
could
not
believe
from
past
scenes
between
them
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
aileen
stirred
irritably
i
like
that
she
flared
i
did
it
because
i
wanted
to
and
not
because
of
any
love
for
you
i
can
tell
you
that
i
like
your
nerve
sitting
here
presuming
to
question
me
after
the
way
you
have
neglected
me
she
pushed
back
her
plate
and
made
as
if
to
get
up
wait
a
minute
aileen
he
said
simply
putting
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looking
across
the
handsome
table
where
sevres
silver
fruit
and
dainty
dishes
were
spread
and
where
under
lights
they
sat
opposite
each
other
i
wish
you
would
talk
that
way
to
me
you
know
that
i
am
not
a
petty
fool
you
know
that
whatever
you
do
i
am
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
with
you
i
know
why
you
are
acting
this
way
and
how
you
will
feel
afterward
if
you
go
on
it
is
anything
i
will
do
he
paused
caught
by
a
wave
of
feeling
oh
is
it
she
blazed
trying
to
overcome
the
emotion
that
was
rising
in
herself
the
calmness
of
him
stirred
up
memories
of
the
past
well
you
keep
your
sympathy
for
yourself
i
do
need
it
i
will
get
along
i
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
she
shoved
her
plate
away
with
such
force
that
she
upset
a
glass
in
which
was
champagne
the
wine
making
a
frayed
yellowish
splotch
on
the
white
linen
and
rising
hurried
toward
the
door
she
was
choking
with
anger
pain
shame
regret
aileen
aileen
he
called
hurrying
after
her
regardless
of
the
butler
who
hearing
the
sound
of
stirring
chairs
had
entered
these
family
woes
were
an
old
story
to
him
it
love
you
want
not
revenge
i
know
i
can
tell
you
want
to
be
loved
by
some
one
completely
i
sorry
you
must
be
too
hard
on
me
i
be
on
you
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
detained
her
as
they
entered
the
next
room
by
this
time
aileen
was
too
ablaze
with
emotion
to
talk
sensibly
or
understand
what
he
was
doing
let
me
go
she
exclaimed
angrily
hot
tears
in
her
eyes
let
me
go
i
tell
you
i
do
love
you
any
more
i
tell
you
i
hate
you
she
flung
herself
loose
and
stood
erect
before
him
i
do
want
you
to
talk
to
me
i
do
want
you
to
speak
to
me
you
the
cause
of
all
my
troubles
you
the
cause
of
whatever
i
do
when
i
do
it
and
you
dare
to
deny
it
you
see
you
see
i
show
you
what
do
she
twisted
and
turned
but
he
held
her
firmly
until
in
his
strong
grasp
as
usual
she
collapsed
and
began
to
cry
oh
i
cry
she
declared
even
in
her
tears
but
it
will
be
just
the
same
it
too
late
too
late
chapter
xxxviii
an
hour
of
defeat
the
stoic
cowperwood
listening
to
the
blare
and
excitement
that
went
with
the
fall
campaign
was
much
more
pained
to
learn
of
desertion
than
to
know
that
he
had
arrayed
a
whole
social
element
against
himself
in
chicago
he
could
not
forget
the
wonder
of
those
first
days
when
aileen
was
young
and
love
and
hope
had
been
the
substance
of
her
being
the
thought
ran
through
all
his
efforts
and
cogitations
like
a
distantly
orchestrated
undertone
in
the
main
in
spite
of
his
activity
he
was
an
introspective
man
and
art
drama
and
the
pathos
of
broken
ideals
were
not
beyond
him
he
harbored
in
no
way
any
grudge
against
aileen
only
a
kind
of
sorrow
over
the
inevitable
consequences
of
his
own
ungovernable
disposition
the
will
to
freedom
within
himself
change
change
the
inevitable
passing
of
things
who
parts
with
a
perfect
thing
even
if
no
more
than
an
unreasoning
love
without
a
touch
of
but
there
followed
swiftly
the
sixth
of
november
with
its
election
noisy
and
irrational
and
the
latter
resulted
in
a
resounding
defeat
out
of
the
democratic
aldermen
nominated
only
ten
were
elected
giving
the
opposition
a
full
majority
in
council
tiernan
and
kerrigan
of
course
being
safely
in
their
places
with
them
came
a
republican
mayor
and
all
his
republican
associates
on
the
ticket
who
were
now
supposed
to
carry
out
the
theories
of
the
respectable
and
the
virtuous
cowperwood
knew
what
it
meant
and
prepared
at
once
to
make
overtures
to
the
enemy
from
mckenty
and
others
he
learned
by
degrees
the
full
story
of
tiernan
and
treachery
but
he
did
not
store
it
up
bitterly
against
them
such
was
life
they
must
be
looked
after
more
carefully
in
future
or
caught
in
some
trap
and
utterly
undone
according
to
their
own
accounts
they
had
barely
managed
to
scrape
through
look
at
meself
i
only
won
by
three
hundred
votes
archly
declared
kerrigan
on
divers
and
sundry
occasions
by
god
i
almost
lost
me
own
ward
tiernan
was
equally
emphatic
the
police
was
no
good
to
me
he
declared
firmly
they
let
the
other
fellows
beat
up
me
men
i
only
polled
six
thousand
when
i
should
have
had
nine
but
no
one
believed
them
while
mckenty
meditated
as
to
how
in
two
years
he
should
be
able
to
undo
this
temporary
victory
and
cowperwood
was
deciding
that
conciliation
was
the
best
policy
for
him
schryhart
hand
and
arneel
joining
hands
with
young
macdonald
were
wondering
how
they
could
make
sure
that
this
party
victory
would
cripple
cowperwood
and
permanently
prevent
him
from
returning
to
power
it
was
a
long
intricate
fight
that
followed
but
it
involved
before
cowperwood
could
possibly
reach
the
new
aldermen
a
proposed
reintroduction
and
passage
of
the
general
electric
franchise
the
granting
of
rights
and
privileges
in
outlying
districts
to
various
minor
companies
and
last
and
worst
a
thing
which
had
not
previously
dawned
on
cowperwood
as
in
any
way
probable
the
projection
of
an
ordinance
granting
to
a
certain
south
side
corporation
the
privilege
of
erecting
and
operating
an
elevated
road
this
was
as
severe
a
blow
as
any
that
had
yet
been
dealt
cowperwood
for
it
introduced
a
new
factor
and
complication
into
the
chicago
situation
which
had
hitherto
for
all
its
troubles
been
comparatively
simple
in
order
to
make
this
plain
it
should
be
said
that
some
eighteen
or
twenty
years
before
in
new
york
there
had
been
devised
and
erected
a
series
of
elevated
roads
calculated
to
relieve
the
congestion
of
traffic
on
the
lower
portion
of
that
long
and
narrow
island
and
they
had
proved
an
immense
success
cowperwood
had
been
interested
in
them
along
with
everything
else
which
pertained
to
public
street
traffic
from
the
very
beginning
in
his
various
trips
to
new
york
he
had
made
a
careful
physical
inspection
of
them
he
knew
all
about
their
incorporation
backers
the
expense
connected
with
them
their
returns
and
so
forth
personally
in
so
far
as
new
york
was
concerned
he
considered
them
an
ideal
solution
of
traffic
on
that
crowded
island
here
in
chicago
where
the
population
was
as
yet
comparatively
small
verging
now
toward
a
million
and
widely
scattered
over
a
great
area
he
did
not
feel
that
they
would
be
profitable
certainly
not
for
some
years
to
come
what
traffic
they
gained
would
be
taken
from
the
surface
lines
and
if
he
built
them
he
would
be
merely
doubling
his
expenses
to
halve
his
profits
from
time
to
time
he
had
contemplated
the
possibility
of
their
being
built
by
other
men
providing
they
could
secure
a
franchise
which
previous
to
the
late
election
had
not
seemed
probable
and
in
this
connection
he
had
once
said
to
addison
let
them
sink
their
money
and
about
the
time
the
population
is
sufficient
to
support
the
lines
they
will
have
been
driven
into
the
hands
of
receivers
that
will
simply
chase
the
game
into
my
bag
and
i
can
buy
them
for
a
mere
song
with
this
conclusion
addison
had
agreed
but
since
this
conversation
circumstances
made
the
construction
of
these
elevated
roads
far
less
problematic
in
the
first
place
public
interest
in
the
idea
of
elevated
roads
was
increasing
they
were
a
novelty
a
factor
in
the
life
of
new
york
and
at
this
time
rivalry
with
the
great
cosmopolitan
heart
was
very
keen
in
the
mind
of
the
average
chicago
citizen
public
sentiment
in
this
direction
however
naive
or
unworthy
was
nevertheless
sufficient
to
make
any
elevated
road
in
chicago
popular
for
the
time
being
in
the
second
place
it
so
happened
that
because
of
this
swelling
tide
of
municipal
enthusiasm
this
renaissance
of
the
west
chicago
had
finally
been
chosen
at
a
date
shortly
preceding
the
present
campaign
as
the
favored
city
for
an
enormous
international
fair
quite
the
largest
ever
given
in
america
men
such
as
hand
schryhart
merrill
and
arneel
to
say
nothing
of
the
various
newspaper
publishers
and
editors
had
been
enthusiastic
supporters
of
the
project
and
in
this
cowperwood
had
been
one
with
them
no
sooner
however
had
the
award
actually
been
granted
than
cowperwood
enemies
made
it
their
first
concern
to
utilize
the
situation
against
him
to
begin
with
the
site
of
the
fair
by
aid
of
the
new
council
was
located
on
the
south
side
at
the
terminus
of
the
schryhart
line
thus
making
the
whole
city
pay
tribute
to
that
corporation
simultaneously
the
thought
suddenly
dawned
upon
the
schryhart
faction
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
stroke
of
business
if
the
new
york
idea
were
now
introduced
into
the
city
not
so
much
with
the
purpose
of
making
money
immediately
but
in
order
to
bring
the
hated
magnate
to
an
understanding
that
he
had
a
formidable
rival
which
might
invade
the
territory
that
he
now
monopolized
curtailing
his
and
thus
making
it
advisable
for
him
to
close
out
his
holdings
and
depart
bland
and
interesting
were
the
conferences
held
by
schryhart
with
hand
and
by
hand
with
arneel
on
this
subject
their
plan
as
first
outlined
was
to
build
an
elevated
road
on
the
south
side
south
of
the
proposed
and
once
that
was
popular
having
previously
secured
franchises
which
would
cover
the
entire
field
west
south
and
north
to
construct
the
others
at
their
leisure
and
so
to
bid
cowperwood
a
sweet
and
smiling
adieu
cowperwood
awaiting
the
assembling
of
the
new
city
council
one
month
after
election
did
not
propose
to
wait
in
peace
and
quiet
until
the
enemy
should
strike
at
him
unprepared
calling
those
familiar
agents
his
corporation
attorneys
around
him
he
was
shortly
informed
of
the
new
idea
and
it
gave
him
a
real
shock
obviously
hand
and
schryhart
were
now
in
deadly
earnest
at
once
he
dictated
a
letter
to
gilgan
asking
him
to
call
at
his
office
at
the
same
time
he
hurriedly
adjured
his
advisers
to
use
due
diligence
in
discovering
what
influences
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
new
mayor
the
honorable
chaffee
thayer
sluss
to
cause
him
to
veto
the
ordinances
in
case
they
came
before
him
to
effect
in
him
indeed
a
total
change
of
heart
the
hon
chaffee
thayer
sluss
whose
attitude
in
this
instance
was
to
prove
crucial
was
a
tall
shapely
somewhat
grandiloquent
person
who
took
himself
and
his
social
and
commercial
opportunities
and
doings
in
the
most
serious
and
as
it
were
elevated
light
you
know
perhaps
the
type
of
man
or
woman
who
raised
in
an
atmosphere
of
comparative
comfort
and
some
small
social
pretension
and
being
short
of
those
gray
convolutions
in
the
human
which
permit
an
individual
to
see
life
in
all
its
fortuitousness
and
uncertainty
proceed
because
of
an
absence
of
necessity
and
the
consequent
lack
of
human
experience
to
take
themselves
and
all
that
they
do
in
the
most
reverential
and
spirit
the
hon
chaffee
thayer
sluss
reasoned
that
because
of
the
splendid
ancestry
on
which
he
prided
himself
he
was
an
essentially
honest
man
his
father
had
amassed
a
small
fortune
in
the
wholesale
harness
business
the
wife
whom
at
the
age
of
he
had
married
a
pretty
but
inconsequential
type
of
woman
was
the
daughter
of
a
pickle
manufacturer
whose
wares
were
in
some
demand
and
whose
children
had
been
considered
good
catches
in
the
neighborhood
from
which
the
hon
chaffee
sluss
emanated
there
had
been
a
highly
conservative
wedding
feast
and
a
honeymoon
trip
to
the
garden
of
the
gods
and
the
grand
canon
then
the
sleek
chaffee
much
in
the
grace
of
both
families
because
of
his
smug
determination
to
rise
in
the
world
had
returned
to
his
business
which
was
that
of
a
and
had
begun
with
the
greatest
care
to
amass
a
competence
on
his
own
account
the
honorable
chaffee
be
it
admitted
had
no
particular
faults
unless
those
of
smugness
and
a
certain
as
to
his
own
prospects
and
opportunities
can
be
counted
as
such
but
he
had
one
weakness
which
in
view
of
his
young
wife
stern
and
somewhat
puritanic
ideas
and
the
religious
propensities
of
his
father
and
was
exceedingly
disturbing
to
him
he
had
an
eye
for
the
beauty
of
women
in
general
and
particularly
for
plump
blonde
women
with
hair
now
and
then
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
an
ideal
wife
and
two
lovely
children
he
would
cast
a
meditative
and
speculative
eye
after
those
alluring
forms
that
cross
the
path
of
all
men
and
that
seem
to
beckon
slyly
by
implication
if
not
by
actual
open
suggestion
however
it
was
not
until
several
years
after
sluss
had
married
and
when
he
might
have
been
considered
settled
in
the
ways
of
righteousness
that
he
actually
essayed
to
any
extent
the
role
of
a
gay
lothario
an
experience
or
two
with
the
less
vigorous
and
vicious
girls
of
the
streets
a
tentative
love
affair
with
a
girl
in
his
office
who
was
not
new
to
the
practices
she
encouraged
and
he
was
fairly
launched
he
lent
himself
at
first
to
the
great
folly
of
pretending
to
love
truly
but
this
was
taken
by
one
and
another
intelligent
young
woman
with
a
grain
of
salt
the
entertainment
and
preferment
he
could
provide
were
accepted
as
sufficient
reward
one
girl
however
actually
seduced
had
to
be
compensated
by
five
thousand
dollars
and
that
after
such
terrors
and
heartaches
his
wife
her
family
and
his
own
looming
up
horribly
in
the
background
as
should
have
cured
him
forever
of
a
penchant
for
stenographers
and
employees
generally
thereafter
for
a
long
time
he
confined
himself
strictly
to
such
acquaintances
as
he
could
make
through
agents
brokers
and
manufacturers
who
did
business
with
him
and
who
occasionally
invited
him
to
one
form
of
bacchanalian
feast
or
another
as
time
went
on
he
became
wiser
if
alas
a
little
more
eager
by
association
with
merchants
and
some
superior
politicians
whom
he
chanced
to
encounter
and
because
the
ward
in
which
he
lived
happened
to
be
a
pivotal
one
he
began
to
speak
publicly
on
occasion
and
to
gather
dimly
the
import
of
that
logic
which
sees
life
as
a
pagan
wild
and
religion
and
convention
as
the
forms
man
puts
on
or
off
to
suit
his
fancy
mood
and
whims
during
the
onward
drift
of
the
ages
not
for
chaffee
thayer
sluss
to
grasp
the
true
meaning
of
it
all
his
brain
was
not
big
enough
men
led
dual
lives
it
was
true
but
say
what
you
would
and
in
the
face
of
his
own
erring
conduct
this
was
very
bad
on
sunday
when
he
went
to
church
with
his
wife
he
felt
that
religion
was
essential
and
purifying
in
his
own
business
he
found
himself
frequently
confronted
by
various
little
flaws
of
logic
relating
to
undue
profits
misrepresentations
and
the
like
but
say
what
you
would
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
god
was
god
morality
was
superior
the
church
was
important
it
was
wrong
to
yield
to
impulses
as
he
found
it
so
fascinating
to
do
one
should
be
better
than
his
neighbor
or
pretend
to
be
what
is
to
be
done
with
such
a
moralistic
ass
as
this
in
spite
of
all
his
philanderings
and
the
resultant
qualms
due
to
his
fear
of
being
found
out
he
prospered
in
business
and
rose
to
some
eminence
in
his
own
community
as
he
had
grown
more
lax
he
had
become
somewhat
more
genial
and
tolerant
more
generally
acceptable
he
was
a
good
republican
a
follower
in
the
wake
of
norrie
simms
and
young
truman
leslie
macdonald
his
was
both
rich
and
moderately
influential
having
lent
himself
to
some
campaign
speaking
and
to
party
work
in
general
he
proved
quite
an
adept
because
of
all
these
things
his
ability
such
as
it
was
his
pliability
and
his
thoroughly
respectable
savor
he
had
been
slated
as
candidate
for
mayor
on
the
republican
ticket
which
had
subsequently
been
elected
cowperwood
was
well
aware
from
remarks
made
in
the
previous
campaign
of
the
derogatory
attitude
of
mayor
sluss
already
he
had
discussed
it
in
a
conversation
with
the
hon
joel
avery
senator
who
was
in
his
employ
at
the
time
avery
had
recently
been
in
all
sorts
of
corporation
work
and
knew
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
courts
lawyers
judges
politicians
as
he
knew
his
revised
statutes
he
was
a
very
little
man
not
more
than
five
feet
one
inch
tall
with
a
wide
forehead
saffron
hair
and
brows
brown
eyes
and
a
mushy
underlip
that
occasionally
covered
the
upper
one
as
he
thought
after
years
and
years
avery
had
learned
to
smile
but
it
was
in
a
strange
exotic
way
mostly
he
gazed
steadily
folded
his
lower
lip
over
his
upper
one
and
expressed
his
almost
unchangeable
conclusions
in
slow
addisonian
phrases
in
the
present
crisis
it
was
avery
who
had
a
suggestion
to
make
one
thing
that
i
think
could
be
done
he
said
to
cowperwood
one
day
in
a
very
confidential
conference
would
be
to
have
a
look
into
the
the
shall
i
say
the
heart
affairs
of
the
hon
chaffee
thayer
sluss
avery
eyes
gleamed
sardonically
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
judging
the
man
by
his
personal
presence
merely
he
is
the
sort
of
person
who
probably
has
had
or
if
not
might
readily
be
induced
to
have
some
compromising
affair
with
a
woman
which
would
require
considerable
sacrifice
on
his
part
to
smooth
over
we
are
all
human
and
vulnerable
up
went
avery
lower
lip
covering
the
upper
one
and
then
down
again
and
it
does
not
behoove
any
of
us
to
be
too
severely
ethical
and
sluss
is
a
man
but
a
trifle
sentimental
as
i
take
it
as
avery
paused
cowperwood
merely
contemplated
him
amused
no
less
by
his
personal
appearance
than
by
his
suggestion
not
a
bad
idea
he
said
though
i
do
like
to
mix
heart
affairs
with
politics
yes
said
avery
soulfully
there
may
be
something
in
it
i
do
know
you
never
can
tell
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
the
task
of
obtaining
an
account
of
sluss
habits
tastes
and
proclivities
was
assigned
to
that
now
rather
dignified
legal
personage
burton
stimson
who
in
turn
assigned
it
to
an
assistant
a
marchbanks
it
was
an
amazing
situation
in
some
respects
but
those
who
know
anything
concerning
the
intricacies
of
politics
finance
and
corporate
control
as
they
were
practised
in
those
palmy
days
would
never
marvel
at
the
wells
of
subtlety
sinks
of
misery
and
morasses
of
disaster
which
they
represented
from
another
quarter
the
hon
patrick
gilgan
was
not
slow
in
responding
to
cowperwood
message
whatever
his
political
connections
and
proclivities
he
did
not
care
to
neglect
so
powerful
a
man
and
what
can
i
be
doing
for
you
mr
cowperwood
he
inquired
when
he
arrived
looking
nice
and
fresh
very
spick
and
span
after
his
victory
listen
gilgan
said
cowperwood
simply
eying
the
republican
county
chairman
very
fixedly
and
twiddling
his
thumbs
with
fingers
interlocked
are
you
going
to
let
the
city
council
jam
through
the
general
electric
and
that
south
side
road
ordinance
without
giving
me
a
chance
to
say
a
word
or
do
anything
about
it
gilgan
so
cowperwood
knew
was
only
one
of
a
new
quadrumvirate
setting
out
to
rule
the
city
but
he
pretended
to
believe
that
he
was
the
last
word
an
all
power
and
authority
after
the
fashion
of
mckenty
me
good
man
replied
gilgan
archly
you
flatter
me
i
have
the
city
council
in
me
vest
pocket
i
been
county
chairman
it
true
and
helped
to
elect
some
of
these
men
but
i
do
own
why
should
they
pass
the
general
electric
ordinance
it
an
honest
ordinance
as
far
as
i
know
all
the
newspapers
have
been
for
it
as
for
this
road
ordinance
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
is
anything
i
know
much
about
young
macdonald
and
schryhart
are
looking
after
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
that
gilgan
was
saying
was
decidedly
true
a
henchman
of
young
macdonald
who
was
beginning
to
learn
to
play
politics
an
alderman
by
the
name
of
klemm
had
been
scheduled
as
a
kind
of
and
it
was
macdonald
not
gilgan
tiernan
kerrigan
or
edstrom
who
was
to
round
up
the
recalcitrant
aldermen
telling
them
their
duty
gilgan
quadrumvirate
had
not
as
yet
got
their
machine
in
good
working
order
though
they
were
doing
their
best
to
bring
this
about
i
helped
to
elect
every
one
of
these
men
true
but
that
does
mean
i
running
by
any
means
concluded
gilgan
not
yet
anyhow
at
the
not
yet
cowperwood
smiled
just
the
same
gilgan
he
went
on
smoothly
you
the
nominal
head
and
front
of
this
whole
movement
in
opposition
to
me
at
present
and
you
the
one
i
have
to
look
to
you
have
this
present
republican
situation
almost
entirely
in
your
own
fingers
and
you
can
do
about
as
you
like
if
you
so
minded
if
you
choose
you
can
persuade
the
members
of
council
to
take
considerable
more
time
than
they
otherwise
would
in
passing
these
ordinances
of
that
i
sure
i
do
know
whether
you
know
or
not
gilgan
though
i
suppose
you
do
that
this
whole
fight
against
me
is
a
strike
campaign
intended
to
drive
me
out
of
chicago
now
you
a
man
of
sense
and
judgment
and
considerable
business
experience
and
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
think
that
is
fair
i
came
here
some
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
ago
and
went
into
the
gas
business
it
was
an
open
field
the
field
i
undertook
to
develop
outlying
towns
on
the
north
south
and
west
sides
yet
the
moment
i
started
the
companies
began
to
fight
me
though
i
was
invading
their
territory
at
all
at
the
time
i
remember
it
well
enough
replied
gilgan
i
was
one
of
the
men
that
helped
you
to
get
your
hyde
park
franchise
you
never
have
got
it
if
it
had
been
for
me
that
fellow
mckibben
added
gilgan
with
a
grin
a
likely
chap
him
he
always
walked
as
if
he
had
on
rubber
shoes
he
with
you
yet
i
suppose
yes
he
around
here
somewhere
replied
cowperwood
loftily
but
to
go
back
to
this
other
matter
most
of
the
men
that
are
behind
this
general
electric
ordinance
and
this
road
franchise
were
in
the
gas
business
blackman
jules
baker
schryhart
and
others
and
they
are
angry
because
i
came
into
their
field
and
angrier
still
because
they
had
eventually
to
buy
me
out
they
angry
because
i
reorganized
these
companies
here
and
put
them
on
their
feet
merrill
is
angry
because
i
did
run
a
loop
around
his
store
and
the
others
are
angry
because
i
ever
got
a
loop
at
all
they
all
angry
because
i
managed
to
step
in
and
do
the
things
that
they
should
have
done
long
before
i
came
here
and
that
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
i
had
to
have
the
city
council
with
me
to
be
able
to
do
anything
at
all
and
because
i
managed
to
make
it
friendly
and
keep
it
so
they
turned
on
me
in
that
section
and
gone
into
politics
i
know
well
enough
gilgan
concluded
cowperwood
who
has
been
behind
you
in
this
fight
i
known
all
along
where
the
money
has
been
coming
from
you
won
and
you
won
handsomely
and
i
for
one
do
begrudge
you
your
victory
in
the
least
but
what
i
want
to
know
now
is
are
you
going
to
help
them
carry
this
fight
on
against
me
in
this
way
or
are
you
not
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
fighting
chance
there
going
to
be
another
election
in
two
years
politics
is
a
bed
of
roses
that
stays
made
just
because
you
make
it
once
these
fellows
that
you
have
got
in
with
are
a
crowd
of
silk
stockings
they
have
any
sympathy
with
you
or
any
one
like
you
they
willing
to
be
friendly
with
you
now
just
long
enough
to
get
something
out
of
you
and
club
me
to
death
but
after
that
how
long
do
you
think
they
will
have
any
use
for
you
how
long
not
very
long
maybe
replied
gilgan
simply
and
contemplatively
but
the
world
is
the
world
and
we
have
to
take
it
as
we
find
it
quite
so
replied
cowperwood
undismayed
but
chicago
is
chicago
and
i
will
be
here
as
long
as
they
will
fighting
me
in
this
fashion
building
elevated
roads
to
cut
into
my
profits
and
giving
franchises
to
rival
companies
is
going
to
get
me
out
or
seriously
injure
me
either
i
here
to
stay
and
the
political
situation
as
it
is
is
going
to
remain
the
same
forever
and
ever
now
you
are
an
ambitious
man
i
can
see
that
you
not
in
politics
for
your
health
that
i
know
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
you
want
and
whether
i
ca
get
it
for
you
as
quick
if
not
quicker
than
these
other
fellows
what
is
it
i
can
do
for
you
that
will
make
you
see
that
my
side
is
just
as
good
as
theirs
and
better
i
am
playing
a
legitimate
game
in
chicago
i
been
building
up
an
excellent
service
i
do
want
to
be
annoyed
every
fifteen
minutes
by
a
rival
company
coming
into
the
field
now
what
can
i
do
to
straighten
this
out
is
there
some
way
that
you
and
i
can
come
together
without
fighting
at
every
step
ca
you
suggest
some
programme
we
can
both
follow
that
will
make
things
easier
cowperwood
paused
and
gilgan
thought
for
a
long
time
it
was
true
as
cowperwood
said
that
he
was
not
in
politics
for
his
health
the
situation
as
at
present
conditioned
was
not
inherently
favorable
for
the
brilliant
programme
he
had
originally
mapped
out
for
himself
tiernan
kerrigan
and
edstrom
were
friendly
as
yet
but
they
were
already
making
extravagant
demands
and
the
reformers
those
who
had
been
led
by
the
newspapers
to
believe
that
cowperwood
was
a
scoundrel
and
all
his
works
vile
were
demanding
that
a
strictly
moral
programme
be
adhered
to
in
all
the
doings
of
council
and
that
no
jobs
contracts
or
deals
of
any
kind
be
entered
into
without
the
full
knowledge
of
the
newspapers
and
of
the
public
gilgan
even
after
the
first
conference
with
his
colleagues
had
begun
to
feel
that
he
was
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
but
he
was
feeling
his
way
and
not
inclined
to
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
it
rather
a
flat
proposition
you
makin
me
he
said
softly
after
a
time
askin
me
to
throw
down
me
friends
the
moment
i
won
a
victory
for
it
not
the
way
i
been
used
to
playin
politics
there
may
be
a
lot
of
truth
in
what
you
say
still
a
man
ca
be
jumpin
around
like
a
cat
in
a
bag
he
has
to
be
faithful
to
somebody
sometime
gilgan
paused
considerably
nonplussed
by
his
own
position
well
replied
cowperwood
sympathetically
think
it
over
difficult
business
this
business
of
politics
i
in
it
for
one
only
because
i
have
to
be
if
you
see
any
way
you
can
help
me
or
i
can
help
you
let
me
know
in
the
mean
time
do
take
in
bad
part
what
i
just
said
i
in
the
position
of
a
man
with
his
hack
to
the
wall
i
fighting
for
my
life
naturally
i
going
to
fight
but
you
and
i
need
be
the
worse
friends
for
that
we
may
become
the
best
of
friends
yet
it
well
i
know
that
said
gilgan
and
it
the
best
of
friends
like
to
be
with
you
but
even
if
i
could
take
care
of
the
aldermen
which
i
could
alone
as
yet
there
the
mayor
i
do
know
him
at
all
except
to
say
now
and
then
but
he
very
much
opposed
to
you
as
i
understand
it
he
be
running
around
most
likely
and
talking
in
the
papers
a
man
like
that
can
do
a
good
deal
i
may
be
able
to
arrange
for
that
replied
cowperwood
perhaps
sluss
can
be
reached
it
may
be
that
he
is
as
opposed
to
me
as
he
thinks
he
is
you
never
can
tell
chapter
xxxix
the
new
administration
oliver
marchbanks
the
youthful
fox
to
whom
stimson
had
assigned
the
task
of
trapping
sluss
in
some
legally
unsanctioned
act
had
by
scurrying
about
finally
pieced
together
enough
of
a
story
to
make
it
exceedingly
unpleasant
for
the
honorable
chaffee
in
case
he
were
to
become
the
too
willing
tool
of
cowperwood
enemies
the
principal
agent
in
this
affair
was
a
certain
claudia
carlstadt
adventuress
detective
by
disposition
and
a
sort
of
smiling
prostitute
and
hireling
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
highly
presentable
and
experienced
individual
needless
to
say
cowperwood
knew
nothing
of
these
minor
proceedings
though
a
genial
nod
from
him
in
the
beginning
had
set
in
motion
the
whole
machinery
of
trespass
in
this
respect
claudia
carlstadt
the
instrument
of
the
honorable
undoing
was
blonde
slender
notably
fresh
as
yet
being
only
and
as
ruthless
and
unconsciously
cruel
as
only
the
avaricious
and
unthinking
type
unthinking
in
the
larger
philosophic
meaning
of
the
word
can
be
to
grasp
the
reason
for
her
being
one
would
have
had
to
see
the
spiritless
south
halstead
street
world
from
which
she
had
sprung
one
of
those
neighborhoods
of
old
cracked
and
battered
houses
where
slatterns
trudge
to
and
fro
with
and
shutters
swing
on
broken
hinges
in
her
youth
claudia
had
been
made
to
rush
the
growler
to
sell
newspapers
at
the
corner
of
halstead
and
harrison
streets
and
to
buy
cocaine
at
the
nearest
drug
store
her
little
dresses
and
underclothing
had
always
been
of
the
poorest
and
shabbiest
material
torn
and
dirty
her
ragged
stockings
frequently
showed
the
white
flesh
of
her
thin
little
legs
and
her
shoes
were
worn
and
cracked
letting
the
water
and
snow
seep
through
in
winter
her
companions
were
wretched
little
street
boys
of
her
own
neighborhood
from
whom
she
learned
to
swear
and
to
understand
and
indulge
in
vile
practices
though
as
is
often
the
case
with
children
she
was
not
utterly
depraved
thereby
at
that
at
eleven
when
her
mother
died
she
ran
away
from
the
wretched
children
home
to
which
she
had
been
committed
and
by
putting
up
a
piteous
tale
she
was
harbored
on
the
west
side
by
an
irish
family
whose
two
daughters
were
clerks
in
a
large
retail
store
through
these
claudia
became
a
thereafter
followed
an
individual
career
as
strange
and
checkered
as
anything
that
had
gone
before
sufficient
to
say
that
claudia
native
intelligence
was
considerable
at
the
age
of
twenty
she
had
managed
through
her
connections
with
the
son
of
a
shoe
manufacturer
and
with
a
rich
jeweler
to
amass
a
little
cash
and
an
extended
wardrobe
it
was
then
that
a
handsome
young
western
congressman
newly
elected
invited
her
to
washington
to
take
a
position
in
a
government
bureau
this
necessitated
a
knowledge
of
stenography
and
typewriting
which
she
soon
acquired
later
she
was
introduced
by
a
western
senator
into
that
form
of
secret
service
which
has
no
connection
with
legitimate
government
but
which
is
profitable
she
was
used
to
extract
secrets
by
flattery
and
cajolery
where
ordinary
bribery
would
not
avail
a
matter
of
tracing
the
secret
financial
connections
of
an
illinois
congressman
finally
brought
her
back
to
chicago
and
here
young
stimson
encountered
her
from
him
she
learned
of
the
political
and
financial
conspiracy
against
cowperwood
and
was
in
an
odd
manner
fascinated
from
her
congressmen
friends
she
already
knew
something
of
sluss
stimson
indicated
that
it
would
be
worth
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
and
expenses
if
the
mayor
were
successfully
compromised
thus
claudia
carlstadt
was
gently
navigated
into
sluss
glowing
life
the
matter
was
not
so
difficult
of
accomplishment
through
the
hon
joel
avery
marchbanks
secured
a
letter
from
a
political
friend
of
sluss
in
behalf
of
a
young
widow
temporarily
embarrassed
a
competent
stenographer
and
the
like
who
wished
a
place
under
the
new
administration
thus
equipped
claudia
presented
herself
at
the
mayor
office
armed
for
the
fray
as
it
were
in
a
fetching
black
silk
of
a
strangely
heavy
grain
her
throat
and
fingers
ornamented
with
simple
pearls
her
yellow
hair
arranged
about
her
temples
in
exquisite
curls
sluss
was
very
busy
but
made
an
appointment
the
next
time
she
appeared
a
yellow
and
red
velvet
rose
had
been
added
to
her
corsage
she
was
a
shapely
young
woman
who
had
acquired
the
art
of
walking
sitting
standing
and
bending
after
the
most
approved
theories
of
the
washington
cocotte
sluss
was
interested
at
once
but
circumspect
and
careful
he
was
now
mayor
of
a
great
city
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
he
remembered
having
already
met
brandon
as
the
lady
styled
herself
and
she
reminded
him
where
it
had
been
two
years
before
in
the
grill
of
the
richelieu
he
immediately
recalled
details
of
the
interesting
occasion
ah
yes
and
since
then
as
i
understand
it
you
married
and
your
husband
died
most
unfortunate
sluss
had
a
large
international
manner
suited
as
he
thought
to
a
man
in
so
exalted
a
position
brandon
nodded
resignedly
her
eyebrows
and
lashes
were
carefully
darkened
so
as
to
sweeten
the
lines
of
her
face
and
a
dimple
had
been
made
in
one
cheek
by
the
aid
of
an
orange
stick
she
was
the
picture
of
delicate
femininity
appealingly
distressful
and
yet
to
all
appearance
commercially
competent
at
the
time
i
met
you
you
were
connected
with
the
government
service
in
washington
i
believe
yes
i
had
a
small
place
in
the
treasury
department
but
this
new
administration
put
me
out
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
leaned
forward
thus
bringing
her
torso
into
a
ravishing
position
she
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
done
many
things
besides
work
in
the
treasury
department
no
least
detail
as
she
observed
was
lost
on
sluss
he
noted
her
shoes
which
were
button
patent
leather
with
cloth
tops
her
gloves
which
were
glace
black
kid
with
white
stitching
at
the
back
and
fastened
by
buttons
the
coral
necklace
worn
on
this
occasion
and
her
yellow
and
red
velvet
rose
evidently
a
trig
and
hopeful
widow
even
if
so
recently
bereaved
let
me
see
mused
sluss
where
are
you
living
just
let
me
make
a
note
of
your
address
this
is
a
very
nice
letter
from
barry
suppose
you
give
me
a
few
days
to
think
what
i
can
do
this
is
tuesday
come
in
again
on
friday
i
see
if
anything
suggests
itself
he
strolled
with
her
to
the
official
door
and
noted
that
her
step
was
light
and
springy
at
parting
she
turned
a
very
melting
gaze
upon
him
and
at
once
he
decided
that
if
he
could
he
would
find
her
something
she
was
the
most
fascinating
applicant
that
had
yet
appeared
the
end
of
chaffee
thayer
sluss
was
not
far
distant
after
this
brandon
returned
as
requested
her
costume
enlivened
this
time
by
a
petticoat
which
contrived
to
show
its
ingratiating
flounces
beneath
the
glistening
black
broadcloth
of
her
skirt
say
did
you
get
on
to
that
observed
one
of
the
doormen
a
from
the
previous
regime
to
another
of
the
same
vintage
some
style
to
the
new
administration
hey
we
not
so
slow
do
you
think
he
pulled
his
coat
together
and
fumbled
at
his
collar
to
give
himself
an
air
of
smartness
and
gazed
gaily
at
his
partner
both
of
them
over
sixty
and
dusty
specimens
at
that
the
other
poked
him
in
the
stomach
hold
your
horses
there
bill
not
so
fast
we
ai
got
a
real
start
yet
give
us
another
six
months
and
then
watch
out
sluss
was
pleased
to
see
brandon
he
had
spoken
to
john
bastienelli
the
new
commissioner
of
taxes
whose
offices
were
directly
over
the
way
on
the
same
hall
and
the
latter
seeing
that
he
might
want
favors
of
the
mayor
later
on
had
volubly
agreed
to
take
care
of
the
lady
i
am
very
glad
to
be
able
to
give
you
this
letter
to
bastienelli
commented
sluss
as
he
rang
for
a
stenographer
not
only
for
the
sake
of
my
old
friend
barry
but
for
your
own
as
well
do
you
know
barry
very
well
he
asked
curiously
only
slightly
admitted
brandon
feeling
that
sluss
would
be
glad
to
know
she
was
not
very
intimate
with
those
who
were
recommending
her
i
was
sent
to
him
by
a
mr
amerman
she
named
an
entirely
fictitious
personage
sluss
was
relieved
as
he
handed
her
the
note
she
once
more
surveyed
him
with
those
grateful
persuasive
appealing
eyes
they
made
him
almost
dizzy
and
set
up
a
chemical
perturbation
in
his
blood
which
quite
dispelled
his
good
resolutions
in
regard
to
the
strange
woman
and
his
need
of
being
circumspect
you
say
you
are
living
on
the
north
side
he
inquired
smiling
weakly
almost
foolishly
yes
i
have
taken
such
a
nice
little
apartment
lincoln
park
i
did
know
whether
i
was
going
to
be
able
to
keep
it
up
but
now
that
i
have
this
position
you
been
so
very
kind
to
me
sluss
she
concluded
with
the
same
air
i
hope
you
wo
forget
me
entirely
if
i
could
be
of
any
personal
service
to
you
at
any
time
sluss
was
rather
beside
himself
at
the
thought
that
this
charming
baggage
of
femininity
having
come
so
close
for
the
minute
was
now
passing
on
and
might
disappear
entirely
by
a
great
effort
of
daring
as
they
walked
toward
the
door
he
managed
to
say
i
shall
have
to
look
into
that
little
place
of
yours
sometime
and
see
how
you
are
getting
along
i
live
up
that
way
myself
oh
do
she
exclaimed
warmly
it
would
be
so
kind
i
am
practically
alone
in
the
world
perhaps
you
play
cards
i
know
how
to
make
a
most
wonderful
punch
i
should
like
you
to
see
how
cozily
i
am
settled
at
this
sluss
now
completely
in
tow
of
his
principal
weakness
capitulated
i
will
he
said
i
surely
will
and
that
sooner
than
you
expect
perhaps
you
must
let
me
know
how
you
are
getting
along
he
took
her
hand
she
held
his
quite
warmly
now
i
hold
you
to
your
promise
she
gurgled
in
a
throaty
coaxing
way
a
few
days
later
he
encountered
her
at
in
his
hall
where
she
had
been
literally
lying
in
wait
for
him
in
order
to
repeat
her
invitation
then
he
came
the
employees
who
worked
about
the
city
hall
in
connection
with
the
mayor
office
were
hereafter
instructed
to
note
as
witnesses
the
times
of
arrival
and
departure
of
brandon
and
sluss
a
note
that
he
wrote
to
brandon
was
carefully
treasured
and
sufficient
evidence
as
to
their
presence
at
hotels
and
restaurants
was
garnered
to
make
out
a
damaging
case
the
whole
affair
took
about
four
months
then
brandon
suddenly
received
an
offer
to
return
to
washington
and
decided
to
depart
the
letters
that
followed
her
were
a
part
of
the
data
that
was
finally
assembled
in
stimson
office
to
be
used
against
sluss
in
case
he
became
too
obstreperous
in
his
opposition
to
cowperwood
in
the
mean
time
the
organization
which
gilgan
had
planned
with
tiernan
kerrigan
and
edstrom
was
encountering
what
might
be
called
rough
sledding
it
was
discovered
that
owing
to
the
temperaments
of
some
of
the
new
aldermen
and
to
the
attitude
of
their
political
sponsors
no
franchises
of
any
kind
were
to
be
passed
unless
they
had
the
moral
approval
of
such
men
as
hand
sluss
and
the
other
reformers
above
all
no
money
of
any
kind
was
to
be
paid
to
anybody
for
anything
whaddye
think
of
those
damn
and
anyhow
inquired
kerrigan
of
tiernan
shortly
subsequent
to
a
conference
with
gilgan
from
which
tiernan
had
been
unavoidably
absent
they
got
an
ordinance
drawn
up
covering
the
whole
city
in
an
scheme
and
there
ai
anything
in
it
for
anybody
say
whaddye
think
they
think
we
are
anyhow
hey
tiernan
himself
after
his
own
conference
with
edstrom
had
been
busy
getting
the
lay
of
the
land
as
he
termed
it
and
his
investigations
led
him
to
believe
that
a
certain
alderman
by
the
name
of
klemm
a
clever
and
very
respectable
from
the
north
side
was
to
be
the
leader
of
the
republicans
in
council
and
that
he
and
some
ten
or
twelve
others
were
determined
because
of
moral
principles
alone
that
only
honest
measures
should
be
passed
it
was
staggering
at
this
news
kerrigan
who
had
been
calculating
on
a
number
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
his
vote
on
various
occasions
stared
incredulously
well
i
be
damned
he
commented
they
got
a
nerve
what
i
been
talking
to
this
fellow
klemm
of
the
twentieth
said
tiernan
sardonically
say
he
a
real
one
i
met
him
over
at
the
tremont
talkin
to
hvranek
he
shakes
hands
like
a
dead
fish
whaddye
think
he
had
the
nerve
to
say
to
me
is
the
tiernan
of
the
second
he
says
the
same
says
i
you
do
look
as
savage
as
i
thought
you
did
says
he
i
felt
like
sayin
you
do
go
way
i
give
you
a
slight
tap
on
the
wrist
i
like
just
one
pass
at
a
stiff
like
that
up
a
dark
alley
tiernan
almost
groaned
in
anguish
and
then
he
begins
to
say
he
does
see
how
there
can
be
any
reasonable
objection
to
allowin
various
new
companies
to
enter
the
field
sufficiently
clear
he
says
the
public
is
against
monopolies
in
any
form
tiernan
was
mocking
klemm
voice
and
language
my
eye
he
concluded
sententiously
wait
till
he
tries
to
throw
that
dope
into
gumble
and
pinski
and
schlumbohm
haw
haw
haw
kerrigan
at
the
thought
of
these
hearty
aldermen
accustomed
to
all
the
perquisites
of
graft
and
leaned
back
and
gave
vent
to
a
burst
of
laughter
i
tell
you
what
it
is
mike
he
said
archly
hitching
up
his
tight
very
artistic
and
almost
english
trousers
we
up
against
a
bunch
of
pikers
in
this
gilgan
crowd
and
they
got
ta
be
taught
a
lesson
he
knows
it
as
well
as
anybody
else
none
o
that
christian
con
game
goes
around
where
i
am
i
believe
this
man
cowperwood
right
when
he
says
them
fellows
are
a
bunch
of
soreheads
and
jealous
if
cowperwood
willing
to
put
down
good
hard
money
to
keep
out
of

game
let
them
do
as
much
to
stay
in
it
this
ai
no
charity
we
ought
to
be
able
to
round
up
enough
of
these
new
fellows
to
make
schryhart
and
macdonald
come
down
good
and
plenty
for
what
they
want
from
what
gilgan
said
all
along
i
thought
he
was
dealing
with
live
ones
they
paid
to
win
the
election
now
let
pay
to
pull
off
a
swell
franchise
if
they
want
it
eh
you
damn
right
echoed
tiernan
i
with
you
to
a
it
was
not
long
after
this
conversation
that
truman
leslie
macdonald
acting
through
alderman
klemm
proceeded
to
make
a
count
of
noses
and
found
to
his
astonishment
that
he
was
not
as
strong
as
he
had
thought
he
was
political
loyalty
is
such
a
fickle
thing
a
number
of
aldermen
with
curious
names
horback
fogarty
mcgrane
sumulsky
showed
signs
of
being
tampered
with
he
hurried
at
once
to
hand
schryhart
and
arneel
with
this
disconcerting
information
they
had
been
congratulating
themselves
that
the
recent
victory
if
it
resulted
in
nothing
else
would
at
least
produce
a
blanket
road
franchise
and
that
this
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
cowperwood
to
his
knees
upon
receiving
macdonald
message
hand
sent
at
once
for
gilgan
when
he
inquired
as
to
how
soon
a
vote
on
the
general
electric
franchise
which
had
been
introduced
by
klemm
could
reasonably
be
expected
gilgan
declared
himself
much
grieved
to
admit
that
in
one
direction
or
other
considerable
opposition
seemed
to
have
developed
to
the
measure
what
that
said
hand
a
little
savagely
did
we
make
a
plain
bargain
in
regard
to
this
you
had
all
the
money
you
asked
for
you
you
said
you
could
give
me
aldermen
who
would
vote
as
we
agreed
you
not
going
to
go
back
on
your
bargain
are
you
bargain
bargain
retorted
gilgan
irritated
because
of
the
spirit
of
the
assault
i
agreed
to
elect
republican
aldermen
and
that
i
did
i
do
own
body
and
soul
i
did
name
in
every
case
i
made
deals
with
the
men
in
the
different
wards
that
had
the
best
chance
and
that
the
people
wanted
i
not
responsible
for
any
crooked
work
that
going
on
behind
my
back
am
i
i
not
responsible
for
men
not
being
straight
if
they
not
gilgan
face
was
an
aggrieved
but
you
had
the
picking
of
these
men
insisted
hand
aggressively
every
one
of
them
had
your
personal
indorsement
you
made
the
deals
with
them
you
do
mean
to
say
they
going
back
on
their
sacred
agreement
to
fight
cowperwood
tooth
and
nail
there
be
any
misunderstanding
on
their
part
as
to
what
they
were
elected
to
do
the
newspapers
have
been
full
of
the
fact
that
nothing
favorable
to
cowperwood
was
to
be
put
through
that
all
true
enough
replied
gilgan
but
i
ca
be
held
responsible
for
the
private
honesty
of
everybody
sure
i
selected
these
men
sure
i
did
but
i
selected
them
with
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
republicans
and
some
of
the
democrats
i
had
to
make
the
best
terms
i
could
to
pick
the
men
that
could
win
as
far
as
i
can
find
out
most
of
are
satisfied
not
to
do
anything
for
cowperwood
passing
these
ordinances
in
favor
of
other
people
that
stirring
up
the
trouble
hand
broad
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
blue
eyes
surveyed
gilgan
with
suspicion
who
are
these
men
anyhow
he
inquired
like
to
get
a
list
of
them
gilgan
safe
in
his
own
subtlety
was
ready
with
a
toll
of
the
supposed
recalcitrants
they
must
fight
their
own
battles
hand
wrote
down
the
names
determining
meanwhile
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
he
decided
also
to
watch
gilgan
if
there
should
prove
to
be
a
hitch
in
the
programme
the
newspapers
should
be
informed
and
commanded
to
thunder
appropriately
such
aldermen
as
proved
unfaithful
to
the
great
trust
imposed
on
them
should
be
smoked
out
followed
back
to
the
wards
which
had
elected
them
and
exposed
to
the
people
who
were
behind
them
their
names
should
be
pilloried
in
the
public
press
the
customary
hints
as
to
cowperwood
deviltry
and
trickery
should
be
redoubled
but
in
the
mean
time
stimson
avery
mckibben
van
sickle
and
others
were
on
cowperwood
behalf
acting
separately
upon
various
unattached
aldermen
those
not
temperamentally
and
chronically
allied
with
the
reform
idea
and
making
them
understand
that
if
they
could
find
it
possible
to
refrain
from
supporting
measures
for
the
next
two
years
a
bonus
in
the
shape
of
an
annual
salary
of
two
thousand
dollars
or
a
gift
in
some
other
form
perhaps
a
troublesome
note
indorsed
or
a
mortgage
taken
care
of
would
be
forthcoming
together
with
a
guarantee
that
the
general
public
should
never
know
in
no
case
was
such
an
offer
made
direct
friends
or
neighbors
or
suave
unidentified
strangers

mysterious
messages
by
this
method
some
eleven
aldermen
quite
apart
from
the
ten
regular
democrats
who
because
of
mckenty
and
his
influence
could
be
counted
upon
had
been
already
suborned
although
schryhart
hand
and
arneel
did
not
know
it
their
plans
even
as
they
planned
were
being
thus
undermined
and
try
as
they
would
the
coveted
ordinance
for
a
blanket
franchise
persistently
eluded
them
they
had
to
content
themselves
for
the
time
being
with
a
franchise
for
a
single
road
line
on
the
south
side
in
schryhart
own
territory
and
with
a
franchise
to
the
general
electric
covering
only
one
unimportant
line
which
it
would
be
easy
for
cowperwood
if
he
continued
in
power
to
take
over
at
some
later
time
chapter
xl
a
trip
to
louisville
the
most
serious
difficulty
confronting
cowperwood
from
now
on
was
really
not
so
much
political
as
financial
in
building
up
and
financing
his
chicago
enterprises
he
had
in
those
days
when
addison
was
president
of
the
lake
city
national
used
that
bank
as
his
chief
source
of
supply
afterward
when
addison
had
been
forced
to
retire
from
the
lake
city
to
assume
charge
of
the
chicago
trust
company
cowperwood
had
succeeded
in
having
the
latter
designated
as
a
central
reserve
and
in
inducing
a
number
of
rural
banks
to
keep
their
special
deposits
in
its
vaults
however
since
the
war
on
him
and
his
interests
had
begun
to
strengthen
through
the
efforts
of
hand
and
arneel
men
most
influential
in
the
control
of
the
other
banks
of
chicago
and
in
close
touch
with
the
money
barons
of
new
york
there
were
signs
not
wanting
that
some
of
the
country
banks
depositing
with
the
chicago
trust
company
had
been
induced
to
withdraw
because
of
pressure
from
outside
inimical
forces
and
that
more
were
to
follow
it
was
some
time
before
cowperwood
fully
realized
to
what
an
extent
this
financial
opposition
might
be
directed
against
himself
in
its
very
beginning
it
necessitated
speedy
hurryings
to
new
york
philadelphia
cincinnati
baltimore
boston
even
london
at
times
on
the
chance
that
there
would
be
loose
and
ready
cash
in
someone
possession
it
was
on
one
of
these
peregrinations
that
he
encountered
a
curious
personality
which
led
to
various
complications
in
his
life
sentimental
and
otherwise
which
he
had
not
hitherto
contemplated
in
various
sections
of
the
country
cowperwood
had
met
many
men
of
wealth
some
grave
some
gay
with
whom
he
did
business
and
among
these
in
louisville
kentucky
he
encountered
a
certain
nathaniel
gillis
very
wealthy
a
horseman
inventor
roue
from
whom
he
occasionally
extracted
loans
the
colonel
was
an
interesting
figure
in
kentucky
society
and
taking
a
great
liking
to
cowperwood
he
found
pleasure
during
the
brief
periods
in
which
they
were
together
in
piloting
him
about
on
one
occasion
in
louisville
he
observed
frank
with
your
permission
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
to
one
of
the
most
interesting
women
i
know
she
is
good
but
entertaining
she
has
had
a
troubled
history
she
is
the
of
two
of
my
best
friends
both
dead
and
the
of
another
i
like
her
because
i
knew
her
father
and
mother
and
because
she
was
a
clever
little
girl
and
still
is
a
nice
woman
even
if
she
is
getting
along
she
keeps
a
sort
of
house
of
convenience
here
in
louisville
for
a
few
of
her
old
friends
you
have
anything
particular
to
do
have
you
suppose
we
go
around
there
cowperwood
who
was
always
genially
sportive
when
among
strong
men
a
sort
of
bounding
collie
and
who
liked
to
humor
those
who
could
be
of
use
to
him
agreed
it
sounds
interesting
to
me
certainly
i
go
tell
me
more
about
her
is
she
rather
but
better
yet
she
is
connected
with
a
number
of
women
who
are
the
colonel
who
had
a
small
gray
goatee
and
sportive
dark
eyes
winked
the
latter
solemnly
cowperwood
arose
take
me
there
he
said
it
was
a
rainy
night
the
business
on
which
he
was
seeing
the
colonel
required
another
day
to
complete
there
was
little
or
nothing
to
do
on
the
way
the
colonel
retailed
more
of
the
life
history
of
nannie
hedden
as
he
familiarly
called
her
and
explained
that
although
this
was
her
maiden
name
she
had
subsequently
become
first
john
alexander
fleming
then
after
a
divorce
ira
george
carter
and
now
alas
was
known
among
the
exclusive
set
of
fast
livers
to
which
he
belonged
as
plain
hattie
starr
the
keeper
of
a
more
or
less
secret
house
of
ill
repute
cowperwood
did
not
take
so
much
interest
in
all
this
until
he
saw
her
and
then
only
because
of
two
children
the
colonel
told
him
about
one
a
girl
by
her
first
marriage
berenice
fleming
who
was
away
in
a
new
york
the
other
a
boy
rolfe
carter
who
was
in
a
military
school
for
boys
somewhere
in
the
west
that
daughter
of
hers
observed
the
colonel
is
a
chip
of
the
old
block
unless
i
miss
my
guess
i
only
saw
her
two
or
three
times
a
few
years
ago
when
i
was
down
east
at
her
mother
summer
home
but
she
struck
me
as
having
great
charm
even
for
a
girl
of
ten
she
a
lady
born
if
ever
there
was
one
how
her
mother
is
to
keep
her
straight
living
as
she
does
is
more
than
i
know
how
she
keeps
her
in
that
school
is
a
mystery
there
apt
to
be
a
scandal
here
at
any
time
i
very
sure
the
girl
does
know
anything
about
her
business
she
never
lets
her
come
out
here
berenice
fleming
cowperwood
thought
to
himself
what
a
pleasing
name
and
what
a
peculiar
handicap
in
life
how
old
is
the
daughter
now
he
inquired
oh
she
must
be
about
fifteen
not
more
than
that
when
they
reached
the
house
which
was
located
in
a
rather
somber
treeless
street
cowperwood
was
surprised
to
find
the
interior
spacious
and
tastefully
furnished
presently
carter
as
she
was
generally
known
in
society
or
hattie
starr
as
she
was
known
to
a
less
satisfying
world
appeared
cowperwood
realized
at
once
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
who
whatever
her
present
occupation
was
not
without
marked
evidences
of
refinement
she
was
exceedingly
intelligent
if
not
highly
intellectual
trig
vivacious
anything
but
commonplace
a
certain
spirited
undulation
in
her
walk
a
seeming
gay
frank
indifference
to
her
position
in
life
an
obvious
accustomedness
to
polite
surroundings
took
his
fancy
her
hair
was
built
up
in
a
loose
frenchy
way
after
the
fashion
of
the
empire
and
her
cheeks
were
slightly
mottled
with
red
veins
her
color
was
too
high
and
yet
it
was
not
utterly
unbecoming
she
had
friendly
eyes
which
went
well
with
her
hair
along
with
a
pink
flowered
which
became
her
fulling
figure
she
wore
pearls
the
widow
of
two
husbands
thought
cowperwood
the
mother
of
two
children
with
the
colonel
easy
introduction
began
a
light
conversation
carter
gracefully
persisted
that
she
had
known
of
cowperwood
for
some
time
his
strenuous
operations
were
more
or
less
familiar
to
her
it
would
be
nice
she
suggested
since
cowperwood
is
here
if
we
invited
grace
deming
to
call
the
latter
was
a
favorite
of
the
colonel
i
would
be
very
glad
if
i
could
talk
to
carter
gallantly
volunteered
cowperwood
he
scarcely
knew
why
he
was
curious
to
learn
more
of
her
history
on
subsequent
occasions
and
in
more
extended
conversation
with
the
colonel
it
was
retailed
to
him
in
full
nannie
hedden
or
john
alexander
fleming
or
ira
george
carter
or
hattie
starr
was
by
birth
a
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
virginia
and
kentucky
heddens
and
colters
related
in
a
definite
or
vague
way
to
half
the
aristocracy
of
four
or
five
of
the
surrounding
states
now
although
still
a
woman
of
brilliant
parts
she
was
the
keeper
of
a
select
house
of
assignation
in
this
meager
city
of
perhaps
two
hundred
thousand
population
how
had
it
happened
how
could
it
possibly
have
come
about
she
had
been
in
her
day
a
reigning
beauty
she
had
been
born
to
money
and
had
married
money
her
first
husband
john
alexander
fleming
who
had
inherited
wealth
tastes
privileges
and
vices
from
a
long
line
of
flemings
was
a
charming
man
of
the
society
type
he
had
been
trained
in
the
law
with
a
view
to
entering
the
diplomatic
service
but
being
an
idler
by
nature
had
never
done
so
instead
philandering
dancing
hunting
and
the
like
had
taken
up
his
time
when
their
wedding
took
place
the
society
world
considered
it
a
great
match
there
was
wealth
on
both
sides
then
came
much
more
of
that
idle
social
whirl
which
had
produced
the
marriage
even
philanderings
of
a
very
vital
character
were
not
barred
though
deception
in
some
degree
at
least
would
be
necessary
as
a
natural
result
there
followed
the
appearance
in
the
mountains
of
north
carolina
during
a
charming
autumn
outing
of
a
gay
young
spark
by
the
name
of
tucker
tanner
and
the
bestowal
on
him
by
the
beautiful
nannie
fleming
as
she
was
then
called
of
her
temporary
affections
kind
friends
were
quick
to
report
what
fleming
himself
did
not
see
and
fleming
roue
that
he
was
encountering
young
tanner
on
a
high
mountain
road
one
evening
said
to
him
you
get
out
of
this
party
by
night
or
i
will
let
daylight
through
you
in
the
morning
tucker
tanner
realizing
that
however
senseless
and
unfair
the
exaggerated
chivalry
of
the
south
might
be
the
end
would
be
bullets
just
the
same
departed
fleming
disturbed
but
unrepentant
considered
herself
greatly
abused
there
was
much
scandal
then
came
quarrels
drinking
on
both
sides
finally
a
divorce
tucker
tanner
did
not
appear
to
claim
his
damaged
love
but
the
aforementioned
ira
george
carter
a
penniless
of
the
same
generation
and
social
standing
offered
himself
and
was
accepted
by
the
first
marriage
there
had
been
one
child
a
girl
by
the
second
there
was
another
child
a
boy
ira
george
carter
before
the
children
were
old
enough
to
impress
carter
with
the
importance
of
their
needs
or
her
own
affection
for
them
had
squandered
in
one
ridiculous
venture
after
another
the
bulk
of
the
property
willed
to
her
by
her
father
major
wickham
hedden
ultimately
after
drunkenness
and
dissipation
on
the
husband
side
and
finally
his
death
came
the
approach
of
poverty
carter
was
not
practical
and
still
passionate
and
inclined
to
dissipation
however
the
aimless
fatuous
going
to
pieces
of
ira
george
carter
the
looming
pathos
of
the
future
of
the
children
and
a
growing
sense
of
affection
and
responsibility
had
finally
sobered
her
the
lure
of
love
and
life
had
not
entirely
disappeared
but
her
chance
of
sipping
at
those
crystal
founts
had
grown
sadly
slender
a
woman
of
and
still
possessing
some
beauty
she
was
not
content
to
eat
the
husks
provided
for
the
unworthy
her
gorge
rose
at
the
thought
of
that
neglected
state
into
which
the
pariahs
of
society
fall
and
on
which
the
inexperienced
so

neglected
by
her
own
set
shunned
by
the
respectable
her
fortune
quite
gone
she
was
nevertheless
determined
that
she
would
not
be
a
seamstress
or
a
pensioner
upon
the
bounty
of
quondam
friends
by
insensible
degrees
came
first
unhallowed
relationships
through
friendship
and
passing
passion
then
a
curious
intermediate
state
between
the
high
world
of
fashion
and
the
half
world
of
harlotry
until
finally
in
louisville
she
had
become
not
openly
but
actually
the
mistress
of
a
house
of
ill
repute
men
who
knew
how
these
things
were
done
and
who
were
consulting
their
own
convenience
far
more
than
her
welfare
suggested
the
advisability
of
it
three
or
four
friends
like
colonel
gillis
wished
rooms
convenient
place
in
which
to
loaf
gamble
and
bring
their
women
hattie
starr
was
her
name
now
and
as
such
she
had
even
become
known
in
a
vague
way
to
the
police
but
only
vaguely
as
a
woman
whose
home
was
suspiciously
gay
on
occasions
cowperwood
with
his
appetite
for
the
wonders
of
life
his
appreciation
of
the
dramas
which
produce
either
failure
or
success
could
not
help
being
interested
in
this
spoiled
woman
who
was
sailing
so
vaguely
the
seas
of
chance
colonel
gillis
once
said
that
with
some
strong
man
to
back
her
nannie
fleming
could
be
put
back
into
society
she
had
a
pleasant
appeal
she
and
her
two
children
of
whom
she
never
spoke
after
a
few
visits
to
her
home
cowperwood
spent
hours
talking
with
carter
whenever
he
was
in
louisville
on
one
occasion
as
they
were
entering
her
boudoir
she
picked
up
a
photograph
of
her
daughter
from
the
dresser
and
dropped
it
into
a
drawer
cowperwood
had
never
seen
this
picture
before
it
was
that
of
a
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
of
whom
he
obtained
but
the
most
fleeting
glance
yet
with
that
instinct
for
the
essential
and
vital
which
invariably
possessed
him
he
gained
a
keen
impression
of
it
it
was
of
a
delicately
haggard
child
with
a
marvelously
agreeable
smile
a
fine
head
upon
a
thin
neck
and
an
air
of
bored
superiority
combined
with
this
was
a
touch
of
weariness
about
the
eyelids
which
drooped
in
a
lofty
way
cowperwood
was
fascinated
because
of
the
daughter
he
professed
an
interest
in
the
mother
which
he
really
did
not
feel
a
little
later
cowperwood
was
moved
to
definite
action
by
the
discovery
in
a
photographer
window
in
louisville
of
a
second
picture
of
berenice
a
rather
large
affair
which
carter
had
had
enlarged
from
a
print
sent
her
by
her
daughter
some
time
before
berenice
was
standing
rather
indifferently
posed
at
the
corner
of
a
colonial
mantel
a
soft
straw
held
negligently
in
one
hand
one
hip
sunk
lower
than
the
other
a
faint
elusive
smile
playing
dimly
around
her
mouth
the
smile
was
really
not
a
smile
but
only
the
wraith
of
one
and
the
eyes
were
wide
disingenuous
the
picture
because
of
its
simplicity
appealed
to
him
he
did
not
know
that
carter
had
never
sanctioned
its
display
a
personage
was
comment
to
himself
and
he
walked
into
the
photographer
office
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
its
removal
and
the
destruction
of
the
plates
a
dollars
he
found
would
arrange
it
all
plates
prints
everything
since
by
this
ruse
he
secured
a
picture
for
himself
he
promptly
had
it
framed
and
hung
in
his
chicago
rooms
where
sometimes
of
an
afternoon
when
he
was
hurrying
to
change
his
clothes
he
stopped
to
look
at
it
with
each
succeeding
examination
his
admiration
and
curiosity
grew
here
was
perhaps
he
thought
the
true
society
woman
the
lady
the
realization
of
that
ideal
which
merrill
and
many
another
grande
dame
had
suggested
it
was
not
so
long
after
this
again
that
chancing
to
be
in
louisville
he
discovered
carter
in
a
very
troubled
social
condition
her
affairs
had
received
a
severe
setback
a
certain
major
hagenback
a
citizen
of
considerable
prominence
had
died
in
her
home
under
peculiar
circumstances
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
married
and
nominally
living
with
his
wife
in
lexington
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
spent
very
little
time
there
and
at
the
time
of
his
death
of
heart
failure
was
leading
a
pleasurable
existence
with
a
miss
trent
an
actress
whom
he
had
introduced
to
carter
as
his
friend
the
police
through
a
talkative
deputy
coroner
were
made
aware
of
all
the
facts
pictures
of
miss
trent
carter
major
hagenback
his
wife
and
many
curious
details
concerning
carter
home
were
about
to
appear
in
the
papers
when
colonel
gillis
and
others
who
were
powerful
socially
and
politically
interfered
the
affair
was
hushed
up
but
carter
was
in
distress
this
was
more
than
she
had
bargained
for
her
quondam
friends
were
frightened
away
for
the
nonce
she
herself
had
lost
courage
when
cowperwood
saw
her
she
had
been
in
the
very
human
act
of
crying
and
her
eyes
were
red
well
well
he
commented
on
seeing
her
she
was
in
moody
gray
in
the
bargain
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
worrying
about
anything
are
you
oh
cowperwood
she
explained
pathetically
i
have
had
so
much
trouble
since
i
saw
you
you
heard
of
major
hagenback
death
you
cowperwood
who
had
heard
something
of
the
story
from
colonel
gillis
nodded
well
i
have
just
been
notified
by
the
police
that
i
will
have
to
move
and
the
landlord
has
given
me
notice
too
if
it
just
were
for
my
two
children
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
pathetically
cowperwood
meditated
interestedly
have
you
any
place
you
can
go
he
asked
i
have
a
summer
place
in
pennsylvania
she
confessed
but
i
ca
go
there
very
well
in
february
besides
it
my
living
i
worrying
about
i
have
only
this
to
depend
on
she
waved
her
hand
inclusively
toward
the
various
rooms
do
you
own
that
place
in
pennsylvania
he
inquired
yes
but
it
is
worth
much
and
i
could
sell
it
i
been
trying
to
do
that
anyhow
for
some
time
because
berenice
is
getting
tired
of
it
and
have
you
any
money
laid
away
it
taken
all
i
have
to
run
this
place
and
keep
the
children
in
school
i
been
trying
to
give
berenice
and
rolfe
a
chance
to
do
something
for
themselves
at
the
repetition
of
berenice
name
cowperwood
consulted
his
own
interest
or
mood
in
the
matter
a
little
assistance
for
her
would
not
bother
him
much
besides
it
would
probably
eventually
bring
about
a
meeting
with
the
daughter
why
do
you
clear
out
of
this
he
observed
finally
it
no
business
to
be
in
anyhow
if
you
have
any
regard
for
your
children
they
ca
survive
anything
like
this
you
want
to
put
your
daughter
back
in
society
do
you
oh
yes
almost
pleaded
carter
precisely
commented
cowperwood
who
when
he
was
thinking
almost
invariably
dropped
into
a
short
cold
curt
business
manner
yet
he
was
humanely
inclined
in
this
instance
well
then
why
not
live
in
your
pennsylvania
place
for
the
present
or
if
not
that
go
to
new
york
you
ca
stay
here
ship
or
sell
these
things
he
waved
a
hand
toward
the
rooms
i
would
only
too
gladly
replied
carter
if
i
knew
what
to
do
take
my
advice
and
go
to
new
york
for
the
present
you
will
get
rid
of
your
expenses
here
and
i
will
help
you
with
the
rest
for
the
present
anyhow
you
can
get
a
start
again
it
is
too
bad
about
these
children
of
yours
i
will
take
care
of
the
boy
as
soon
as
he
is
old
enough
as
for
berenice
he
used
her
name
softly
if
she
can
stay
in
her
school
until
she
is
nineteen
or
twenty
the
chances
are
that
she
will
make
social
connections
which
will
save
her
nicely
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
avoid
meeting
any
of
this
old
crowd
out
here
in
the
future
if
you
can
it
might
be
advisable
to
take
her
abroad
for
a
time
after
she
leaves
school
yes
if
i
just
could
sighed
carter
rather
lamely
well
do
what
i
suggest
now
and
we
will
see
observed
cowperwood
it
would
be
a
pity
if
your
two
children
were
to
have
their
lives
ruined
by
such
an
accident
as
this
carter
realizing
that
here
in
the
shape
of
cowperwood
if
he
chose
to
be
generous
was
the
open
way
out
of
a
lowering
dungeon
of
misery
was
inclined
to
give
vent
to
a
bit
of
grateful
emotion
but
finding
him
subtly
remote
restrained
herself
his
manner
while
warmly
generous
at
times
was
also
easily
distant
except
when
he
wished
it
to
be
otherwise
just
now
he
was
thinking
of
the
high
soul
of
berenice
fleming
and
of
its
possible
value
to
him
chapter
xli
the
daughter
of
fleming
berenice
fleming
at
the
time
cowperwood
first
encountered
her
mother
was
an
inmate
of
the
misses
brewster
school
for
girls
then
on
riverside
drive
new
york
and
one
of
the
most
exclusive
establishments
of
its
kind
in
america
the
social
prestige
and
connections
of
the
heddens
flemings
and
carters
were
sufficient
to
gain
her
this
introduction
though
the
social
fortunes
of
her
mother
were
already
at
this
time
on
the
down
grade
a
tall
girl
delicately
haggard
as
he
had
imagined
her
with
hair
of
a
tinge
but
distantly
allied
to
that
of
aileen
she
was
unlike
any
woman
cowperwood
had
ever
known
even
at
seventeen
she
stood
up
and
out
with
an
inexplicable
superiority
which
brought
her
the
feverish
and
exotic
attention
of
lesser
personalities
whose
emotional
animality
found
an
outlet
in
swinging
a
censer
at
her
shrine
a
strange
maiden
decidedly
even
at
this
age
when
she
was
as
one
might
suppose
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
she
was
deeply
conscious
of
herself
her
sex
her
significance
her
possible
social
import
armed
with
a
fair
skin
a
few
freckles
an
almost
too
high
color
at
times
strange
deep
eyes
a
long
nose
a
rather
pleasant
mouth
perfect
teeth
and
a
really
good
chin
she
moved
always
with
a
feline
grace
that
was
careless
superior
sinuous
and
yet
the
acme
of
harmony
and
a
rhythmic
flow
of
lines
one
of
her
tricks
when
unobserved
by
her
instructors
was
to
walk
with
six
plates
and
a
all
gracefully
poised
on
the
top
of
her
head
after
the
fashion
of
the
asiatic
and
the
african
her
hips
moving
her
shoulders
neck
and
head
still
girls
begged
weeks
on
end
to
have
her
repeat
this
stunt
as
they
called
it
another
was
to
put
her
arms
behind
her
and
with
a
rush
imitate
the
winged
victory
a
copy
of
which
graced
the
library
hall
you
know
one
little
satellite
used
to
urge
on
her
adoringly
she
must
have
been
like
you
her
head
must
have
been
like
yours
you
are
lovely
when
you
do
it
for
answer
berenice
deep
almost
eyes
turned
on
her
admirer
with
solemn
unflattered
consideration
she
awed
always
by
the
something
that
she
did
not
say
the
school
for
all
the
noble
dames
who
presided
over
it
solemn
inexperienced
conventionalists
who
insisted
on
the
last
tittle
and
jot
of
order
and
procedure
was
a
joke
to
berenice
she
recognized
the
value
of
its
social
import
but
even
at
fifteen
and
sixteen
she
was
superior
to
it
she
was
superior
to
her
superiors
and
to
the
specimens
of
maidenhood
supposed
to
be
perfect
socially
who
gathered
about
to
hear
her
talk
to
hear
her
sing
declaim
or
imitate
she
was
deeply
dramatically
urgently
conscious
of
the
value
of
her
personality
in
itself
not
as
connected
with
any
inherited
social
standing
but
of
its
innate
worth
and
of
the
artistry
and
wonder
of
her
body
one
of
her
chief
delights
was
to
walk
alone
in
her
room
sometimes
at
night
the
lamp
out
the
moon
perhaps
faintly
illuminating
her
chamber
and
to
pose
and
survey
her
body
and
dance
in
some
naive
graceful
airy
greek
way
a
dance
that
was
singularly
free
from
sex
consciousness
and
yet
was
it
she
was
conscious
of
her
body
of
every
inch
of
it
under
the
clothes
which
she
frequently
wore
once
she
wrote
in
a
secret
diary
which
she
maintained
another
art
impulse
or
an
affectation
as
you
will
my
skin
is
so
wonderful
it
tingles
so
with
rich
life
i
love
it
and
my
strong
muscles
underneath
i
love
my
hands
and
my
hair
and
my
eyes
my
hands
are
long
and
thin
and
delicate
my
eyes
are
a
dark
deep
blue
my
hair
is
a
brown
rusty
red
thick
and
sleepy
my
long
firm
untired
limbs
can
dance
all
night
oh
i
love
life
i
love
life
you
would
not
have
called
berenice
fleming
sensuous
though
she
was
because
she
was
her
eyes
lied
to
you
they
lied
to
all
the
world
they
looked
you
through
and
through
with
a
calm
savoir
faire
a
mocking
defiance
which
said
with
a
faint
curl
of
the
lips
barely
suggested
to
help
them
out
you
can
not
read
me
you
can
not
read
me
she
put
her
head
to
one
side
smiled
lied
by
implication
assumed
that
there
was
nothing
and
there
was
nothing
as
yet
yet
there
was
something
too
her
inmost
convictions
and
these
she
took
good
care
to
conceal
the
world
how
little
it
should
ever
ever
know
how
little
it
ever
could
know
truly
the
first
time
cowperwood
encountered
this
circe
daughter
of
so
unfortunate
a
mother
was
on
the
occasion
of
a
trip
to
new
york
the
second
spring
following
his
introduction
to
carter
in
louisville
berenice
was
taking
some
part
in
the
closing
exercises
of
the
brewster
school
and
carter
with
cowperwood
for
an
escort
decided
to
go
east
cowperwood
having
located
himself
at
the
netherlands
and
carter
at
the
much
humbler
grenoble
they
journeyed
together
to
visit
this
paragon
whose
picture
he
had
had
hanging
in
his
rooms
in
chicago
for
months
past
when
they
were
introduced
into
the
somewhat
somber
reception
parlor
of
the
brewster
school
berenice
came
slipping
in
after
a
few
moments
a
noiseless
figure
of
a
girl
tall
and
slim
and
deliciously
sinuous
cowperwood
saw
at
first
glance
that
she
fulfilled
all
the
promise
of
her
picture
and
was
delighted
she
had
he
thought
a
strange
shrewd
intelligent
smile
which
however
was
girlish
and
friendly
without
so
much
as
a
glance
in
his
direction
she
came
forward
extending
her
arms
and
hands
in
an
inimitable
histrionic
manner
and
exclaimed
with
a
practised
and
yet
natural
inflection
mother
dear
so
here
you
are
really
you
know
i
been
thinking
of
you
all
morning
i
was
sure
whether
you
would
come
you
change
about
so
i
think
i
even
dreamed
of
you
last
night
her
skirts
still
worn
just
below
the
had
the
richness
of
scraping
silk
then
fashionable
she
was
also
guilty
of
using
a
faint
perfume
of
some
kind
cowperwood
could
see
that
carter
despite
a
certain
nervousness
due
to
the
girl
superior
individuality
and
his
presence
was
very
proud
of
her
berenice
he
also
saw
quickly
was
measuring
him
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
a
single
sweeping
glance
which
she
vouchsafed
from
beneath
her
long
lashes
sufficing
but
she
gathered
quite
accurately
the
totality
of
cowperwood
age
force
grace
wealth
and
worldly
ability
without
hesitation
she
classed
him
as
a
man
of
power
in
some
field
possibly
finance
one
of
the
numerous
able
men
whom
her
mother
seemed
to
know
she
always
wondered
about
her
mother
his
large
gray
eyes
that
searched
her
with
lightning
accuracy
appealed
to
her
as
pleasant
able
eyes
she
knew
on
the
instant
young
as
she
was
that
he
liked
women
and
that
probably
he
would
think
her
charming
but
as
for
giving
him
additional
attention
it
was
outside
her
code
she
preferred
to
be
interested
in
her
dear
mother
exclusively
berenice
observed
carter
airily
let
me
introduce
mr
cowperwood
berenice
turned
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
leveled
a
frank
and
yet
condescending
glance
from
wells
of
what
cowperwood
considered
to
be
indigo
blue
your
mother
has
spoken
of
you
from
time
to
time
he
said
pleasantly
she
withdrew
a
cool
thin
hand
as
limp
and
soft
as
wax
and
turned
to
her
mother
again
without
comment
and
yet
without
the
least
embarrassment
cowperwood
seemed
in
no
way
important
to
her
what
would
you
say
dear
pursued
carter
after
a
brief
exchange
of
commonplaces
if
i
were
to
spend
next
winter
in
new
york
it
would
be
charming
if
i
could
live
at
home
i
sick
of
this
silly
why
berenice
i
thought
you
liked
it
i
hate
it
but
only
because
it
so
dull
the
girls
here
are
so
silly
carter
lifted
her
eyebrows
as
much
as
to
say
to
her
escort
now
what
do
you
think
cowperwood
stood
solemnly
by
it
was
not
for
him
to
make
a
suggestion
at
present
he
could
see
that
for
some
reason
probably
because
of
her
disordered
life
carter
was
playing
a
game
of
manners
with
her
daughter
she
maintained
always
a
lofty
romantic
air
with
berenice
it
was
natural
the
expression
of
a
vain
superior
disposition
a
rather
charming
garden
here
he
observed
lifting
a
curtain
and
looking
out
into
a
blooming
plot
yes
the
flowers
are
nice
commented
berenice
wait
i
get
some
for
you
it
against
the
rules
but
they
do
more
than
send
me
away
and
that
what
i
want
berenice
come
back
here
it
was
carter
calling
the
daughter
was
gone
in
a
fling
of
graceful
lines
and
flounces
now
what
do
you
make
of
her
asked
carter
turning
to
her
friend
youth
individuality
energy
a
hundred
things
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
her
if
i
could
only
see
to
it
that
she
had
her
opportunities
unspoiled
already
berenice
was
returning
a
subject
for
an
artist
in
almost
studied
lines
her
arms
were
full
of
and
roses
which
she
had
ruthlessly
gathered
you
wilful
girl
scolded
her
mother
indulgently
i
shall
have
to
go
and
explain
to
your
superiors
whatever
shall
i
do
with
her
mr
cowperwood
load
her
with
daisy
chains
and
transport
her
to
cytherea
commented
cowperwood
who
had
once
visited
this
romantic
isle
and
therefore
knew
its
significance
berenice
paused
what
a
pretty
speech
that
is
she
exclaimed
i
have
a
notion
to
give
you
a
special
flower
for
that
i
will
too
she
presented
him
with
a
rose
for
a
girl
who
had
slipped
in
shy
and
still
cowperwood
commented
her
mood
had
certainly
changed
still
this
was
the
privilege
of
the
born
actress
to
change
and
as
he
viewed
berenice
fleming
now
he
felt
her
to
be
such
a
born
actress
lissome
subtle
wise
indifferent
superior
taking
the
world
as
she
found
it
and
expecting
it
to
obey
to
sit
up
like
a
pet
dog
and
be
told
to
beg
what
a
charming
character
what
a
pity
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
bloom
undisturbed
in
its
garden
what
a
pity
indeed
chapter
xlii
cowperwood
guardian
it
was
some
time
after
this
first
encounter
before
cowperwood
saw
berenice
again
and
then
only
for
a
few
days
in
that
region
of
the
pocono
mountains
where
carter
had
her
summer
home
it
was
an
idyllic
spot
on
a
mountainside
some
three
miles
from
stroudsburg
among
a
peculiar
juxtaposition
of
hills
which
from
the
comfortable
recesses
of
a
front
veranda
had
the
appearance
as
carter
was
fond
of
explaining
of
elephants
and
camels
parading
in
the
distance
the
humps
of
the
hills
some
of
them
as
high
as
eighteen
hundred
feet
rose
stately
and
green
below
quite
visible
for
a
mile
or
more
moved
the
dusty
white
road
descending
to
stroudsburg
out
of
her
louisville
earnings
carter
had
managed
to
employ
for
the
several
summer
seasons
she
had
been
here
a
gardener
who
kept
the
sloping
front
lawn
in
seasonable
flowers
there
was
a
trig
trap
with
a
smart
horse
and
harness
and
both
rolfe
and
berenice
were
possessed
of
the
latest
novelty
of
the
day
bicycles
which
had
just
then
superseded
the
old
variety
for
berenice
also
was
a
full
of
classic
music
and
song
collections
a
piano
a
shelf
of
favorite
books
various
athletic
implements
and
several
types
of
greek
which
she
had
designed
herself
including
sandals
and
fillet
for
her
hair
she
was
an
idle
reflective
erotic
person
dreaming
strange
dreams
of
a
near
and
yet
social
supremacy
at
other
times
busying
herself
with
such
social
opportunities
as
came
to
her
a
more
safely
calculating
and
yet
wilful
girl
than
berenice
fleming
would
have
been
hard
to
find
by
some
trick
of
mental
adjustment
she
had
gained
a
clear
prevision
of
how
necessary
it
was
to
select
the
right
socially
and
to
conceal
her
true
motives
and
feelings
and
yet
she
was
by
no
means
a
snob
mentally
nor
utterly
calculating
certain
things
in
her
own
and
in
her
mother
life
troubled
her
quarrels
in
her
early
days
from
her
seventh
to
her
eleventh
year
between
her
mother
and
her
stepfather
carter
the
latter
drunkenness
verging
upon
delirium
tremens
at
times
movings
from
one
place
to
another
all
sorts
of
sordid
and
depressing
happenings
berenice
had
been
an
impressionable
child
some
things
had
gripped
her
memory
mightily
once
for
instance
when
she
had
seen
her
stepfather
in
the
presence
of
her
governess
kick
a
table
over
and
seizing
the
toppling
lamp
with
demoniac
skill
hurl
it
through
a
window
she
herself
had
been
tossed
by
him
in
one
of
these
tantrums
when
in
answer
to
the
cries
of
terror
of
those
about
her
he
had
shouted
let
her
fall
it
wo
hurt
the
little
devil
to
break
a
few
bones
this
was
her
keenest
memory
of
her
stepfather
and
it
rather
softened
her
judgment
of
her
mother
made
her
sympathetic
with
her
when
she
was
inclined
to
be
critical
of
her
own
father
she
only
knew
that
he
had
divorced
her
mother
why
she
could
not
say
she
liked
her
mother
on
many
counts
though
she
could
not
feel
that
she
actually
loved
her
carter
was
too
fatuous
at
times
and
at
other
times
too
restrained
this
house
at
pocono
or
forest
edge
as
carter
had
named
it
was
conducted
after
a
peculiar
fashion
from
june
to
october
only
it
was
open
carter
in
the
past
having
returned
to
louisville
at
that
time
while
berenice
and
rolfe
went
back
to
their
respective
schools
rolfe
was
a
cheerful
youth
well
bred
genial
and
courteous
but
not
very
brilliant
intellectually
cowperwood
judgment
of
him
the
first
time
he
saw
him
was
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
make
a
good
confidential
clerk
possibly
in
a
bank
berenice
on
the
other
hand
the
child
of
the
first
husband
was
a
creature
of
an
exotic
mind
and
an
opalescent
heart
after
his
first
contact
with
her
in
the
of
the
brewster
school
cowperwood
was
deeply
conscious
of
the
import
of
this
budding
character
he
was
by
now
so
familiar
with
types
and
kinds
of
women
that
an
exceptional
type
quite
like
an
exceptional
horse
to
a
judge
of
stood
out
in
his
mind
with
singular
vividness
quite
as
in
some
great
an
ambitious
horseman
might
imagine
that
he
detected
in
some
likely
filly
the
signs
and
lineaments
of
the
future
winner
of
a
derby
so
in
berenice
fleming
in
the
quiet
precincts
of
the
brewster
school
cowperwood
previsioned
the
central
figure
of
a
newport
lawn
fete
or
a
london
why
she
had
the
air
the
grace
the
lineage
the
blood
that
was
why
and
on
that
score
she
appealed
to
him
intensely
quite
as
no
other
woman
before
had
ever
done
it
was
on
the
lawn
of
forest
edge
that
cowperwood
now
saw
berenice
the
latter
had
had
the
gardener
set
up
a
tall
pole
to
which
was
attached
a
by
a
cord
and
she
and
rolfe
were
hard
at
work
on
a
game
of
cowperwood
after
a
telegram
to
carter
had
been
met
at
the
station
in
pocono
by
her
and
rapidly
driven
out
to
the
house
the
green
hills
pleased
him
the
yellow
road
the
cottage
with
the
roof
in
the
distance
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
and
bright
for
a
sinking
sun
there
they
are
now
observed
carter
cheerful
and
smiling
as
they
came
out
from
under
a
low
ledge
that
skirted
the
road
a
little
way
from
the
cottage
berenice
executing
a
tripping
running
step
to
one
side
was
striking
the
tethered
ball
with
her
racquet
they
are
hard
at
it
as
usual
two
such
romps
she
surveyed
them
with
pleased
motherly
interest
which
cowperwood
considered
did
her
much
credit
he
was
thinking
that
it
would
be
too
bad
if
her
hopes
for
her
children
should
not
be
realized
yet
possibly
they
might
not
be
life
was
very
grim
how
strange
he
thought
was
this
type
of
woman
at
once
a
sympathetic
affectionate
mother
and
a
panderer
to
the
vices
of
men
how
strange
that
she
should
have
these
children
at
all
berenice
had
on
a
white
skirt
white
a
silk
waist
or
blouse
which
fitted
her
very
loosely
because
of
exercise
her
color
was
high
quite
pink
and
her
dusty
reddish
hair
was
blowy
though
they
turned
into
the
hedge
gate
and
drove
to
the
west
entrance
which
was
at
one
side
of
the
house
there
was
no
cessation
of
the
game
not
even
a
glance
from
berenice
so
busy
was
she
he
was
merely
her
mother
friend
to
her
cowperwood
noted
with
singular
vividness
of
feeling
that
the
lines
of
her
movements
the
fleeting
momentary
positions
she
assumed
were
full
of
a
wondrous
natural
charm
he
wanted
to
say
so
to
carter
but
restrained
himself
it
a
brisk
game
he
commented
with
a
pleased
glance
you
play
do
you
oh
i
did
i
do
much
any
more
sometimes
i
try
a
set
with
rolfe
or
bevy
but
they
both
beat
me
so
badly
bevy
who
is
bevy
oh
that
short
of
berenice
it
what
rolfe
called
her
when
he
was
a
baby
bevy
i
think
that
rather
nice
i
always
like
it
too
somehow
it
seems
to
suit
her
and
yet
i
know
why
before
dinner
berenice
made
her
appearance
freshened
by
a
bath
and
clad
in
a
light
summer
dress
that
appeared
to
cowperwood
to
be
all
flounces
and
the
more
graceful
in
its
lines
for
the
problematic
absence
of
a
corset
her
face
and
hands
however
a
face
thin
long
and
sweetly
hollow
and
hands
that
were
slim
and
sinewy
gripped
and
held
his
fancy
he
was
reminded
in
the
least
degree
of
stephanie
but
this
girl
chin
was
firmer
and
more
delicately
though
more
aggressively
rounded
her
eyes
too
were
shrewder
and
less
evasive
though
subtle
enough
so
i
meet
you
again
he
observed
with
a
somewhat
aloof
air
as
she
came
out
on
the
porch
and
sank
listlessly
into
a
wicker
chair
the
last
time
i
met
you
you
were
hard
at
work
in
new
york
breaking
the
rules
no
i
forget
that
was
my
easiest
work
oh
rolfe
she
called
over
her
shoulder
indifferently
i
see
your
out
on
the
grass
cowperwood
properly
suppressed
waited
a
brief
space
who
won
that
exciting
game
i
did
of
course
i
always
win
at
oh
do
you
commented
cowperwood
i
mean
with
brother
of
course
he
plays
so
poorly
she
turned
to
the
west
the
house
faced
south
and
studied
the
road
which
came
up
from
stroudsburg
i
do
believe
that
harry
kemp
she
added
quite
to
herself
if
so
he
have
my
mail
if
there
is
any
she
got
up
again
and
disappeared
into
the
house
coming
out
a
few
moments
later
to
saunter
down
to
the
gate
which
was
over
a
hundred
feet
away
to
cowperwood
she
seemed
to
float
so
hale
and
graceful
was
she
a
smart
youth
in
blue
serge
coat
white
trousers
and
white
shoes
drove
by
in
a
trap
two
letters
for
you
he
called
in
a
high
almost
falsetto
voice
i
thought
you
would
have
eight
or
nine
blessed
hot
is
it
he
had
a
smart
though
somewhat
effeminate
manner
and
cowperwood
at
once
wrote
him
down
as
an
ass
berenice
took
the
mail
with
an
engaging
smile
she
sauntered
past
him
reading
without
so
much
as
a
glance
presently
he
heard
her
voice
within
mother
the
haggertys
have
invited
me
for
the
last
week
in
august
i
have
half
a
mind
to
cut
tuxedo
and
go
i
like
bess
haggerty
well
you
have
to
decide
that
dearest
are
they
going
to
be
at
tarrytown
or
loon
lake
loon
lake
of
course
came
berenice
voice
what
a
world
of
social
doings
she
was
involved
in
thought
cowperwood
she
had
begun
well
the
haggertys
were
rich
operators
in
pennsylvania
harris
haggerty
to
whose
family
she
was
probably
referring
was
worth
at
least
six
or
eight
million
the
social
world
they
moved
in
was
high
they
drove
after
dinner
to
the
saddler
at
saddler
run
where
a
dance
and
moonlight
promenade
was
to
be
given
on
the
way
over
owing
to
the
remoteness
of
berenice
cowperwood
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
himself
to
be
getting
old
in
spite
of
the
vigor
of
his
mind
and
body
he
realized
constantly
that
he
was
over
while
she
was
only
seventeen
why
should
this
lure
of
youth
continue
to
possess
him
she
wore
a
white
concoction
of
lace
and
silk
which
showed
a
pair
of
smooth
young
shoulders
and
a
slender
queenly
inimitably
modeled
neck
he
could
tell
by
the
sleek
lines
of
her
arms
how
strong
she
was
it
is
perhaps
too
late
he
said
to
himself
in
comment
i
am
getting
old
the
freshness
of
the
hills
in
the
pale
night
was
sad
saddler
when
they
reached
there
after
ten
was
crowded
with
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
vicinity
carter
who
was
prepossessing
in
a
ball
costume
of
silver
and
old
rose
expected
that
cowperwood
would
dance
with
her
and
he
did
but
all
the
time
his
eyes
were
on
berenice
who
was
caught
up
by
one
youth
and
another
of
dapper
mien
during
the
progress
of
the
evening
and
carried
rhythmically
by
in
the
mazes
of
the
waltz
or
schottische
there
was
a
new
dance
in
vogue
that
involved
a
gay
running
step
kicking
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
forward
turning
and
running
backward
and
kicking
again
and
then
swinging
with
a
smart
air
back
to
back
with
one
partner
berenice
in
her
lithe
rhythmic
way
seemed
to
him
the
soul
of
spirited
and
gracious
ease
unconscious
of
everybody
and
everything
save
the
spirit
of
the
dance
itself
as
a
medium
of
sweet
emotion
of
some
dreamlike
spirit
of
gaiety
he
wondered
he
was
deeply
impressed
berenice
observed
carter
when
in
an
intermission
she
came
forward
to
where
cowperwood
and
she
were
sitting
in
the
moonlight
discussing
new
york
and
kentucky
social
life
have
you
saved
one
dance
for
mr
cowperwood
cowperwood
with
a
momentary
feeling
of
resentment
protested
that
he
did
not
care
to
dance
any
more
carter
he
observed
to
himself
was
a
fool
i
believe
said
her
daughter
with
a
languid
air
that
i
am
full
up
i
could
break
one
engagement
though
somewhere
not
for
me
though
please
pleaded
cowperwood
i
do
care
to
dance
any
more
thank
you
he
almost
hated
her
at
the
moment
for
a
chilly
cat
and
yet
he
did
not
why
bevy
how
you
talk
i
think
you
are
acting
very
badly
this
evening
please
please
pleaded
cowperwood
quite
sharply
not
any
more
i
do
care
to
dance
any
more
bevy
looked
at
him
oddly
for
a
moment
a
single
thoughtful
glance
but
i
have
a
dance
though
she
pleaded
softly
i
was
just
teasing
wo
you
dance
it
with
me
i
ca
refuse
of
course
replied
cowperwood
coldly
it
the
next
one
she
replied
they
danced
but
he
scarcely
softened
to
her
at
first
so
angry
was
he
somehow
because
of
all
that
had
gone
before
he
felt
stiff
and
ungainly
she
had
managed
to
break
in
upon
his
natural
savoir
faire
this
chit
of
a
girl
but
as
they
went
on
through
a
second
half
the
spirit
of
her
dancing
soul
caught
him
and
he
felt
more
at
ease
quite
rhythmic
she
drew
close
and
swept
him
into
a
strange
unison
with
herself
you
dance
beautifully
he
said
i
love
it
she
replied
she
was
already
of
an
agreeable
height
for
him
it
was
soon
over
i
wish
you
would
take
me
where
the
ices
are
she
said
to
cowperwood
he
led
her
half
amused
half
disturbed
at
her
attitude
toward
him
you
are
having
a
pleasant
time
teasing
me
are
you
he
asked
i
am
only
tired
she
replied
the
evening
bores
me
really
it
does
i
wish
we
were
all
home
we
can
go
when
you
say
no
doubt
as
they
reached
the
ices
and
she
took
one
from
his
hand
she
surveyed
him
with
those
cool
dull
blue
eyes
of
hers
eyes
that
had
the
flat
quality
of
unglazed
dutch
tiles
i
wish
you
would
forgive
me
she
said
i
was
rude
i
could
help
it
i
am
all
out
of
sorts
with
myself
i
had
felt
you
were
rude
he
observed
lying
grandly
his
mood
toward
her
changing
entirely
oh
yes
i
was
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
sincerely
wish
you
would
i
do
with
all
my
heart
the
little
that
there
is
to
forgive
he
waited
to
take
her
back
and
yielded
her
to
a
youth
who
was
waiting
he
watched
her
trip
away
in
a
dance
and
eventually
led
her
mother
to
the
trap
berenice
was
not
with
them
on
the
home
drive
some
one
else
was
bringing
her
cowperwood
wondered
when
she
would
come
and
where
was
her
room
and
whether
she
was
really
sorry
and
as
he
fell
asleep
berenice
fleming
and
her
eyes
were
filling
his
mind
completely
chapter
xliii
the
planet
mars
the
banking
hostility
to
cowperwood
which
in
its
beginning
had
made
necessary
his
trip
to
kentucky
and
elsewhere
finally
reached
a
climax
it
followed
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
furnish
funds
for
the
building
of
elevated
roads
the
hour
for
this
new
form
of
transit
convenience
had
struck
the
public
demanded
it
cowperwood
saw
one
elevated
road
the
south
side
alley
line
being
built
and
another
the
west
side
metropolitan
line
being
proposed
largely
as
he
knew
in
order
to
create
sentiment
for
the
idea
and
so
to
make
his
opposition
to
a
general
franchise
difficult
he
was
well
aware
that
if
he
did
not
choose
to
build
them
others
would
it
mattered
little
that
electricity
had
arrived
finally
as
a
perfected
traction
factor
and
that
all
his
lines
would
soon
have
to
be
done
over
to
meet
that
condition
or
that
it
was
costing
him
thousands
and
thousands
to
stay
the
threatening
aspect
of
things
politically
in
addition
he
must
now
plunge
into
this
new
realm
gaining
franchises
by
the
roughest
and
subtlest
forms
of
political
bribery
the
most
serious
aspect
of
this
was
not
political
but
rather
financial
elevated
roads
in
chicago
owing
to
the
sparseness
of
the
population
over
large
areas
were
a
serious
thing
to
contemplate
the
mere
cost
of
iron
right
of
way
and
was
immense
being
chronically
opposed
to
investing
his
private
funds
where
stocks
could
just
as
well
be
unloaded
on
the
public
and
the
management
and
control
retained
by
him
cowperwood
for
the
time
being
was
puzzled
as
to
where
he
should
get
credit
for
the
millions
to
be
laid
down
in
structural
steel
engineering
fees
labor
and
equipment
before
ever
a
dollar
could
be
taken
out
in
passenger
fares
owing
to
the
advent
of
the
world
fair
the
south
side
to
which
in
order
to
have
peace
and
quiet
he
had
finally
conceded
a
franchise
was
doing
reasonably
well
yet
it
was
not
making
any
such
return
on
the
investment
as
the
new
york
roads
the
new
lines
which
he
was
preparing
would
traverse
even
less
populous
sections
of
the
city
and
would
in
all
likelihood
yield
even
a
smaller
return
money
had
to
be
forthcoming
something
between
twelve
and
fifteen
million
dollars
and
this
on
the
stocks
and
bonds
of
a
purely
paper
corporation
which
might
not
yield
paying
dividends
for
years
to
come
addison
finding
that
the
chicago
trust
company
was
already
heavily
loaded
called
upon
various
minor
but
prosperous
local
banks
to
take
over
the
new
securities
each
in
part
of
course
he
was
astonished
and
chagrined
to
find
that
one
and
all
uniformly
refused
i
tell
you
how
it
is
judah
one
bank
president
confided
to
him
in
great
secrecy
we
owe
timothy
arneel
at
least
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
we
only
have
to
pay
three
per
cent
for
it
a
besides
the
lake
national
is
our
main
standby
when
it
comes
to
quick
trades
and
he
in
on
that
i
understand
from
one
or
two
friends
that
he
at
outs
with
cowperwood
and
we
ca
afford
to
offend
him
i
like
to
but
no
more
for
me
not
at
present
anyhow
why
simmons
replied
addison
these
fellows
are
simply
cutting
off
their
noses
to
spite
their
faces
these
stock
and
bond
issues
are
perfectly
good
investments
and
no
one
knows
it
better
than
you
do
all
this
hue
and
cry
in
the
newspapers
against
cowperwood
amount
to
anything
he
perfectly
solvent
chicago
is
growing
his
lines
are
becoming
more
valuable
every
year
i
know
that
replied
simmons
but
what
about
this
talk
of
a
rival
elevated
system
wo
that
injure
his
lines
for
the
time
being
anyhow
if
it
comes
into
the
field
if
i
know
anything
about
cowperwood
replied
addison
simply
there
is
going
to
be
any
rival
elevated
road
it
true
they
got
the
city
council
to
give
them
a
franchise
for
one
line
on
the
south
side
but
that
out
of
his
territory
anyhow
and
that
other
one
to
the
chicago
general
company
does
amount
to
anything
it
will
be
years
and
years
before
it
can
be
made
to
pay
a
dollar
and
when
the
time
comes
he
will
probably
take
it
over
if
he
wants
it
another
election
will
be
held
in
two
years
and
then
the
city
administration
may
not
be
so
unfavorable
as
it
is
they
have
been
able
to
hurt
him
through
the
council
as
much
as
they
thought
they
would
yes
but
he
lost
the
election
true
but
it
does
follow
he
going
to
lose
the
next
one
or
every
one
just
the
same
replied
simmons
very
secretively
i
understand
there
a
concerted
effort
on
to
drive
him
out
schryhart
hand
merrill
arneel
they
the
most
powerful
men
we
have
i
understand
hand
says
that
he
never
get
his
franchises
renewed
except
on
terms
that
make
his
lines
unprofitable
there
going
to
be
an
awful
smash
here
one
of
these
days
if
that
true
simmons
looked
very
wise
and
solemn
never
believe
it
replied
addison
contemptuously
hand
chicago
neither
is
schryhart
nor
arneel
cowperwood
is
a
brainy
man
he
is
going
to
be
put
under
so
easily
did
you
ever
hear
what
was
the
real
bottom
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
yes
i
heard
replied
simmons
do
you
believe
it
oh
i
do
know
yes
i
suppose
i
do
still
i
do
know
that
that
need
have
anything
to
do
with
it
money
envy
is
enough
to
make
any
man
fight
this
man
hand
is
very
powerful
not
long
after
this
cowperwood
strolling
into
the
president
office
of
the
chicago
trust
company
inquired
well
judah
how
about
those
northwestern
bonds
it
just
as
i
thought
frank
replied
addison
softly
we
have
to
go
outside
of
chicago
for
that
money
hand
arneel
and
the
rest
of
that
crowd
have
decided
to
combine
against
us
that
plain
something
has
started
them
off
in
full
cry
i
suppose
my
resignation
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
anyhow
every
one
of
the
banks
in
which
they
have
any
hand
has
uniformly
refused
to
come
in
to
make
sure
that
i
was
right
i
even
called
up
the
little
old
third
national
of
lake
view
and
the
drovers
and
traders
on
street
charlie
wallin
bank
when
i
was
over
in
the
lake
national
he
used
to
hang
around
the
back
door
asking
for
anything
i
could
give
him
that
was
sound
now
he
says
his
orders
are
from
his
directors
not
to
share
in
anything
we
have
to
offer
it
the
same
story
everywhere
they
dare
i
asked
wallin
if
he
knew
why
the
directors
were
down
on
the
chicago
trust
or
on
you
and
at
first
he
said
he
did
then
he
said
he
stop
in
and
lunch
with
me
some
day
they
the
silliest
lot
of
old
ostriches
i
ever
heard
of
as
if
refusing
to
let
us
have
money
on
any
loan
here
was
going
to
prevent
us
from
getting
it
they
can
take
their
little
old
banks
and
play
blockhouses
with
them
if
they
want
to
i
can
go
to
new
york
and
in
hours
raise
twenty
million
dollars
if
we
need
it
addison
was
a
little
warm
it
was
a
new
experience
for
him
cowperwood
merely
curled
his
mustaches
and
smiled
sardonically
well
never
mind
he
said
will
you
go
down
to
new
york
or
shall
i
it
was
decided
after
some
talk
that
addison
should
go
when
he
reached
new
york
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
local
opposition
to
cowperwood
had
for
some
mysterious
reason
begun
to
take
root
in
the
east
i
tell
you
how
it
is
observed
joseph
haeckelheimer
to
whom
addison
applied
a
short
smug
pussy
person
who
was
the
head
of
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
international
bankers
we
hear
odd
things
concerning
cowperwood
out
in
chicago
some
people
say
he
is
sound
some
not
he
has
some
very
good
franchises
covering
a
large
portion
of
the
city
but
they
are
only
franchises
and
they
will
all
run
out
by
at
the
latest
as
i
understand
it
he
has
managed
to
stir
up
all
the
local
elements
some
very
powerful
ones
too
and
he
is
certain
to
have
a
hard
time
to
get
his
franchises
renewed
i
do
live
in
chicago
of
course
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
our
western
correspondent
tells
me
this
is
so
cowperwood
is
a
very
able
man
as
i
understand
it
but
if
all
these
influential
men
are
opposed
to
him
they
can
make
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
public
is
very
easily
aroused
you
do
a
very
able
man
a
great
injustice
haeckelheimer
addison
retorted
almost
any
one
who
starts
out
to
do
things
successfully
and
intelligently
is
sure
to
stir
up
a
great
deal
of
feeling
the
particular
men
you
mention
seem
to
feel
that
they
have
a
sort
of
proprietor
interest
in
chicago
they
really
think
they
own
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
city
made
them
they
did
make
the
city
haeckelheimer
lifted
his
eyebrows
he
laid
two
fine
white
hands
plump
and
stubby
over
the
lower
buttons
of
his
protuberant
waistcoat
public
favor
is
a
great
factor
in
all
these
enterprises
he
almost
sighed
as
you
know
part
of
a
man
resources
lies
in
his
ability
to
avoid
stirring
up
opposition
it
may
be
that
cowperwood
is
strong
enough
to
overcome
all
that
i
do
know
i
never
met
him
just
telling
you
what
i
hear
this
offish
attitude
on
the
part
of
haeckelheimer
was
indicative
of
a
new
trend
the
man
was
enormously
wealthy
the
firm
of
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
represented
a
controlling
interest
in
some
of
the
principal
railways
and
banks
in
america
their
favor
was
not
to
be
held
in
light
esteem
it
was
plain
that
these
rumors
against
cowperwood
in
new
york
unless
offset
promptly
by
favorable
events
in
chicago
might
mean
in
the
large
banking
quarters
anyhow
the
refusal
of
all
subsequent
cowperwood
issues
it
might
even
close
the
doors
of
minor
banks
and
make
private
investors
nervous
addison
report
of
all
this
annoyed
cowperwood
no
little
it
made
him
angry
he
saw
in
it
the
work
of
schryhart
hand
and
others
who
were
trying
their
best
to
discredit
him
let
them
talk
he
declared
crossly
i
have
the
they
not
going
to
rout
me
out
of
here
i
can
sell
stocks
and
bonds
to
the
public
direct
if
need
be
there
are
plenty
of
private
people
who
are
glad
to
invest
in
these
properties
at
this
psychological
moment
enter
as
by
the
hand
of
fate
the
planet
mars
and
the
university
this
latter
from
having
been
for
years
a
humble
baptist
college
of
the
cheapest
character
had
suddenly
through
the
beneficence
of
a
great
standard
oil
multimillionaire
flared
upward
into
a
great
university
and
was
causing
a
stir
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
educational
world
it
was
already
a
most
noteworthy
spectacle
one
of
the
sights
of
the
city
millions
were
being
poured
into
it
new
and
beautiful
buildings
were
almost
monthly
erected
a
brilliant
dynamic
man
had
been
called
from
the
east
as
president
there
were
still
many
things
needed
dormitories
laboratories
of
one
kind
and
another
a
great
library
and
last
but
not
least
a
giant
telescope
one
that
would
sweep
the
heavens
with
a
hitherto
unparalleled
receptive
eye
and
wring
from
it
secrets
not
previously
decipherable
by
the
eye
and
the
mind
of
man
cowperwood
had
always
been
interested
in
the
heavens
and
in
the
giant
mathematical
and
physical
methods
of
interpreting
them
it
so
happened
that
the
planet
with
its
sinister
aspect
was
just
at
this
time
to
be
seen
hanging
in
the
west
a
fiery
red
and
the
easily
aroused
public
mind
was
being
stirred
to
its
shallow
depth
by
reflections
and
speculations
regarding
the
famous
canals
of
the
luminary
the
mere
thought
of
the
possibility
of
a
larger
telescope
than
any
now
in
existence
which
might
throw
additional
light
on
this
evasive
mystery
was
exciting
not
only
chicago
but
the
whole
world
late
one
afternoon
cowperwood
looking
over
some
open
fields
which
faced
his
new
in
west
madison
street
observed
the
planet
hanging
low
and
lucent
in
the
evening
sky
a
warm
radiant
bit
of
orange
in
a
sea
of
silver
he
paused
and
surveyed
it
was
it
true
that
there
were
canals
on
it
and
people
life
was
surely
strange
one
day
not
long
after
this
alexander
rambaud
called
him
up
on
the
and
remarked
jocosely
i
say
cowperwood
i
played
a
rather
shabby
trick
on
you
just
now
doctor
hooper
of
the
university
was
in
here
a
few
minutes
ago
asking
me
to
be
one
of
ten
to
guarantee
the
cost
of
a
telescope
lens
that
he
thinks
he
needs
to
run
that
school
of
his
out
there
i
told
him
i
thought
you
might
possibly
be
interested
his
idea
is
to
find
some
one
who
will
guarantee
forty
thousand
dollars
or
eight
or
ten
men
who
will
guarantee
four
or
five
thousand
each
i
thought
of
you
because
i
heard
you
discuss
astronomy
from
time
to
time
let
him
come
replied
cowperwood
who
was
never
willing
to
be
behind
others
in
generosity
particularly
where
his
efforts
were
likely
to
be
appreciated
in
significant
quarters
shortly
afterward
appeared
the
doctor
himself
short
rotund
rubicund
displaying
behind
a
pair
of
clear
thick
glasses
round
dancing
incisive
eyes
imaginative
grip
buoyant
were
written
all
over
him
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
one
with
that
examination
which
sees
even
universities
as
futile
in
the
endless
shift
of
things
the
other
with
that
faith
in
the
balance
for
right
which
makes
even
great
personal
forces
such
as
financial
magnates
serve
an
idealistic
end
it
not
a
very
long
story
i
have
to
tell
you
cowperwood
said
the
doctor
our
astronomical
work
is
handicapped
just
now
by
the
simple
fact
that
we
have
no
lens
at
all
no
telescope
worthy
of
the
name
i
should
like
to
see
the
university
do
original
work
in
this
field
and
do
it
in
a
great
way
the
only
way
to
do
it
in
my
judgment
is
to
do
it
better
than
any
one
else
can
do
you
agree
with
me
he
showed
a
row
of
shining
white
teeth
cowperwood
smiled
urbanely
will
a
lens
be
a
better
lens
than
any
other
lens
he
inquired
made
by
appleman
brothers
of
dorchester
it
will
replied
the
college
president
the
whole
story
is
here
cowperwood
these
men
are
practical
a
great
lens
in
the
first
place
is
a
matter
of
finding
a
suitable
crystal
large
and
flawless
crystals
are
not
common
as
you
may
possibly
know
such
a
crystal
has
recently
been
found
and
is
now
owned
by
appleman
it
takes
about
four
or
five
years
to
grind
and
polish
it
most
of
the
polishing
as
you
may
or
may
not
know
is
done
by
the
hand
smoothing
it
with
the
thumb
and
forefinger
the
time
judgment
and
skill
of
an
optical
expert
is
required
unfortunately
that
is
not
cheap
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
however
i
suppose
he
waved
a
soft
full
white
hand
and
forty
thousand
is
little
enough
it
would
be
a
great
honor
if
the
university
could
have
the
largest
most
serviceable
and
most
perfect
lens
in
the
world
it
would
reflect
great
credit
i
take
it
on
the
men
who
would
make
this
possible
cowperwood
liked
the
man
artistically
educational
air
obviously
here
was
a
personage
of
ability
brains
emotion
and
scientific
enthusiasm
it
was
splendid
to
him
to
see
any
strong
man
in
earnest
for
himself
or
others
and
forty
thousand
will
do
this
he
asked
yes
sir
forty
thousand
will
guarantee
us
the
lens
anyhow
and
how
about
land
buildings
a
telescope
frame
have
you
all
those
things
prepared
for
it
not
as
yet
but
since
it
takes
four
years
at
least
to
grind
the
lens
there
will
be
time
enough
when
the
lens
is
nearing
completion
to
look
after
the
accessories
we
have
picked
our
site
however
lake
geneva
and
we
would
not
refuse
either
land
or
accessories
if
we
knew
where
to
get
them
again
the
even
shining
teeth
the
keen
eyes
boring
through
the
glasses
cowperwood
saw
a
great
opportunity
he
asked
what
would
be
the
cost
of
the
entire
project
hooper
presumed
that
three
hundred
thousand
would
do
it
all
handsomely
lens
telescope
land
machinery
building
a
great
monument
and
how
much
have
you
guaranteed
on
the
cost
of
your
lens
sixteen
thousand
dollars
so
far
to
be
paid
when
in
instalments
ten
thousand
a
year
for
four
years
just
enough
to
keep
the
busy
for
the
present
cowperwood
reflected
ten
thousand
a
year
for
four
years
would
be
a
mere
salary
item
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
felt
sure
that
he
could
supply
the
remainder
of
the
money
quite
easily
he
would
be
so
much
richer
his
plans
would
be
so
much
more
mature
on
such
a
repute
the
ability
to
give
a
telescope
out
of
hand
to
be
known
as
the
cowperwood
telescope
he
could
undoubtedly
raise
money
in
london
new
york
and
elsewhere
for
his
chicago
enterprise
the
whole
world
would
know
him
in
a
day
he
paused
his
enigmatic
eyes
revealing
nothing
of
the
splendid
vision
that
danced
before
them
at
last
at
last
how
would
it
do
hooper
he
said
sweetly
if
instead
of
ten
men
giving
you
four
thousand
each
as
you
plan
one
man
were
to
give
you
forty
thousand
in
annual
instalments
of
ten
thousand
each
could
that
be
arranged
as
well
my
dear
cowperwood
exclaimed
the
doctor
glowing
his
eyes
alight
do
i
understand
that
you
personally
might
wish
to
give
the
money
for
this
lens
i
might
yes
but
i
should
have
to
exact
one
pledge
hooper
if
i
did
any
such
thing
and
what
would
that
be
the
privilege
of
giving
the
land
and
the
building
the
whole
telescope
in
fact
i
presume
no
word
of
this
will
be
given
out
unless
the
matter
is
favorably
acted
upon
he
added
cautiously
and
diplomatically
the
new
president
of
the
university
arose
and
eyed
him
with
a
peculiarly
approbative
and
grateful
gaze
he
was
a
busy
overworked
man
his
task
was
large
any
burden
taken
from
his
shoulders
in
this
fashion
was
a
great
relief
my
answer
to
that
cowperwood
if
i
had
the
authority
would
be
to
agree
now
in
the
name
of
the
university
and
thank
you
for
sake
i
must
submit
the
matter
to
the
trustees
of
the
university
but
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
outcome
i
anticipate
nothing
but
grateful
approbation
let
me
thank
you
again
they
shook
hands
warmly
and
the
solid
collegian
bustled
forth
cowperwood
sank
quietly
in
his
chair
he
pressed
his
fingers
together
and
for
a
moment
or
two
permitted
himself
to
dream
then
he
called
a
stenographer
and
began
a
bit
of
dictation
he
did
not
care
to
think
even
to
himself
how
universally
advantageous
all
this
might
yet
prove
to
be
the
result
was
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
proffer
was
formally
accepted
by
the
trustees
of
the
university
and
a
report
of
the
matter
with
cowperwood
formal
consent
was
given
out
for
publication
the
fortuitous
combination
of
circumstances
already
described
gave
the
matter
a
unique
news
value
giant
reflectors
and
refractors
had
been
given
and
were
in
use
in
other
parts
of
the
world
but
none
so
large
or
so
important
as
this
the
gift
was
sufficient
to
set
cowperwood
forth
in
the
light
of
a
public
benefactor
and
patron
of
science
not
only
in
chicago
but
in
london
paris
and
new
york
wherever
indeed
in
the
great
capitals
scientific
and
intellectual
men
were
gathered
this
significant
gift
of
an
apparently
fabulously
rich
american
became
the
subject
of
excited
discussion
banking
men
among
others
took
sharp
note
of
the
donor
and
when
cowperwood
emissaries
came
around
later
with
a
suggestion
that
the
franchises
about
to
be
voted
him
for
elevated
roads
should
be
made
a
basis
of
bond
and
mortgage
loans
they
were
courteously
received
a
man
who
could
give
telescopes
in
the
hour
of
his
greatest
difficulties
must
be
in
a
rather
satisfactory
financial
condition
he
must
have
great
wealth
in
reserve
after
some
preliminaries
during
which
cowperwood
paid
a
flying
visit
to
threadneedle
street
in
london
and
to
wall
street
in
new
york
an
arrangement
was
made
with
an
banking
company
by
which
the
majority
of
the
bonds
for
his
proposed
roads
were
taken
over
by
them
for
sale
in
europe
and
elsewhere
and
he
was
given
ample
means
wherewith
to
proceed

of
his

to

create

having

remained
no

it
involved
among

the

who
quite
unconscious
of
the
evidence
stored
up
against

had
begun
to
fulminate
the
moment
it
was
suggested
in
various
secret
political
quarters
that
a
new
ordinance
was
about
to
be
introduced
and
that
cowperwood
was
to
be
the
beneficiary
do

for

had
courteously
but
firmly
bidden

fully
support

in

will
wholly
desert

things
have
come
to
a
handsome
pass
when
men
sworn
and
elected
to
perform
given
services
turn
on
their
backers
and
betray
them
in
this
way
hand
was
very
wroth
sluss
immaculate
in
black
broadcloth
and
white
linen
was
very
sure
that
he
would
fulfil
to
the
letter
all
of
hand
suggestions
the
proposed
ordinance
should
be
denounced
by
him
its
legislative
progress
heartily
opposed
in
council
they
shall
get
no
quarter
from
me
he
declared
emphatically
i
know
what
the
scheme
is
they
know
that
i
know
it
he
looked
at
hand
quite
as
one
advocate
of
righteousness
should
look
at
another
and
the
rich
promoter
went
away
satisfied
that
the
reins
of
government
were
in
safe
hands
immediately
afterward
sluss
gave
out
an
interview
in
which
he
served
warning
on
all
aldermen
and
councilmen
that
no
such
ordinance
as
the
one
in
question
would
ever
be
signed
by
him
as
mayor
at
half
past
ten
on
the
same
morning
on
which
the
interview
appeared
the
hour
at
which
sluss
usually
reached
his
office
his
private
telephone
bell
rang
and
an
assistant
inquired
if
he
would
be
willing
to
speak
with
frank
cowperwood
sluss
somehow
anticipating
fresh
laurels
of
victory
gratified
by
the
display
given
his
announcement
in
the
morning
papers
and
swelling
internally
with
civic
pride
announced
solemnly
yes
connect
me
sluss
began
cowperwood
at
the
other
end
this
is
frank
a
cowperwood
yes
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
cowperwood
i
see
by
the
morning
papers
that
you
state
that
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
proposed
ordinance
which
looks
to
giving
me
a
franchise
for
any
elevated
road
on
the
north
or
west
side
that
is
quite
true
replied
sluss
loftily
i
will
not
do
you
think
it
is
rather
premature
sluss
to
denounce
something
which
has
only
a
rumored
existence
cowperwood
smiling
sweetly
to
himself
was
quite
like
a
cat
playing
with
an
unsuspicious
mouse
i
should
like
very
much
to
talk
this
whole
matter
over
with
you
personally
before
you
take
an
irrevocable
attitude
it
is
just
possible
that
after
you
have
heard
my
side
you
may
not
be
so
completely
opposed
to
me
from
time
to
time
i
have
sent
to
you
several
of
my
personal
friends
but
apparently
you
do
not
care
to
receive
them
quite
true
replied
sluss
loftily
but
you
must
remember
that
i
am
a
very
busy
man
cowperwood
and
besides
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
serve
any
of
your
purposes
you
are
working
for
a
set
of
conditions
to
which
i
am
morally
and
temperamentally
opposed
i
am
working
for
another
i
do
not
see
that
we
have
any
common
ground
on
which
to
meet
in
fact
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
whatsoever
just
a
moment
please
mayor
replied
cowperwood
still
very
sweetly
and
fearing
that
sluss
might
choose
to
hang
up
the
receiver
so
superior
was
his
tone
there
may
be
some
common
ground
of
which
you
do
not
know
would
you
like
to
come
to
lunch
at
my
residence
or
receive
me
at
yours
or
let
me
come
to
your
office
and
talk
this
matter
over
i
believe
you
will
find
it
the
part
of
wisdom
as
well
as
of
courtesy
to
do
this
i
can
not
possibly
lunch
with
you
replied
sluss
and
i
can
not
see
you
either
there
are
a
number
of
things
pressing
for
my
attention
i
must
say
also
that
i
can
not
hold
any
conferences
with
you
or
your
emissaries
if
you
come
you
must
submit
to
the
presence
of
others
very
well
sluss
replied
cowperwood
cheerfully
i
will
not
come
to
your
office
but
unless
you
come
to
mine
before
five
this
afternoon
you
will
face
by
noon
a
suit
for
breach
of
promise
and
your
letters
to
brandon
will
be
given
to
the
public
i
wish
to
remind
you
that
an
election
is
coming
on
and
that
chicago
favors
a
mayor
who
is
privately
moral
as
well
as
publicly
so
good
morning
cowperwood
hung
up
his
telephone
receiver
with
a
click
and
sluss
sensibly
and
visibly
stiffened
and
paled
brandon
the
charming
lovable
discreet
brandon
who
had
so
ungenerously
left
him
why
should
she
be
thinking
of
suing
him
for
breach
of
promise
and
how
did
his
letter
to
her
come
to
be
in
cowperwood
hands
good
heavens
those
mushy
letters
his
wife
his
children
his
church
and
the
owlish
pastor
thereof
chicago
and
its
conventional
moral
religious
atmosphere
come
to
think
of
it
brandon
had
scarcely
if
ever
written
him
a
note
of
any
kind
he
did
not
even
know
her
history
at
the
thought
of
sluss
her
hard
cold
blue
eyes
sluss
arose
tall
and
distrait
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
he
walked
to
the
window
snapping
his
thumb
and
middle
finger
and
looking
eagerly
at
the
floor
he
thought
of
the
telephone
switchboard
just
outside
his
private
office
and
wondered
whether
his
secretary
a
handsome
young
presbyterian
girl
had
been
listening
as
usual
oh
this
sad
sad
world
if
the
north
side
ever
learned
of
this
hand
the
newspapers
young
macdonald
would
they
protect
him
they
would
not
would
they
run
him
for
mayor
again
never
could
the
public
be
induced
to
vote
for
him
with
all
the
churches
fulminating
against
private
immorality
hypocrites
and
whited
sepulchers
oh
lord
oh
lord
and
he
was
so
very
very
much
respected
and
looked
up
to
that
was
the
worst
of
it
all
this
terrible
demon
cowperwood
had
descended
on
him
and
he
had
thought
himself
so
secure
he
had
not
even
been
civil
to
cowperwood
what
if
the
latter
chose
to
avenge
the
discourtesy
sluss
went
back
to
his
chair
but
he
could
not
sit
in
it
he
went
for
his
coat
took
it
down
hung
it
up
again
took
it
down
announced
over
the
that
he
could
not
see
any
one
for
several
hours
and
went
out
by
a
private
door
wearily
he
walked
along
north
clark
street
looking
at
the
of
traffic
looking
at
the
dirty
crowded
river
looking
at
the
sky
and
smoke
and
gray
buildings
and
wondering
what
he
should
do
the
world
was
so
hard
at
times
it
was
so
cruel
his
wife
his
family
his
political
career
he
could
not
conscientiously
sign
any
ordinances
for
cowperwood
that
would
be
immoral
dishonest
a
scandal
to
the
city
cowperwood
was
a
notorious
traitor
to
the
public
welfare
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
very
well
refuse
for
here
was
brandon
the
charming
and
unscrupulous
creature
playing
into
the
hands
of
cowperwood
if
he
could
only
meet
her
beg
of
her
plead
but
where
was
she
he
had
not
seen
her
for
months
and
months
could
he
go
to
hand
and
confess
all
but
hand
was
a
hard
cold
moral
man
also
oh
lord
oh
lord
he
wondered
and
thought
and
sighed
and
pondered
all
without
avail
pity
the
poor
earthling
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
moral
law
in
another
country
perhaps
in
another
day
another
age
such
a
situation
would
have
been
capable
of
a
solution
one
not
utterly
destructive
to
sluss
and
not
entirely
favorable
to
a
man
like
cowperwood
but
here
in
the
united
states
here
in
chicago
the
ethical
verities
would
all
as
he
knew
be
lined
up
against
him
what
lake
view
would
think
what
his
pastor
would
think
what
hand
and
all
his
moral
associates
would
think
ah
these
were
the
terrible
the
incontrovertible
consequences
of
his
lapse
from
virtue
at
four
after
sluss
had
wandered
for
hours
in
the
snow
and
cold
belaboring
himself
for
a
fool
and
a
knave
and
while
cowperwood
was
sitting
at
his
desk
signing
papers
contemplating
a
glowing
fire
and
wondering
whether
the
mayor
would
deem
it
advisable
to
put
in
an
appearance
his
office
door
opened
and
one
of
his
trim
stenographers
entered
announcing
chaffee
thayer
sluss
enter
mayor
sluss
sad
heavy
subdued
shrunken
a
very
different
gentleman
from
the
one
who
had
talked
so
cavalierly
over
the
wires
some
five
and
a
half
hours
before
gray
weather
severe
cold
and
much
contemplation
of
seemingly
irreconcilable
facts
had
reduced
his
spirits
greatly
he
was
a
little
pale
and
a
little
restless
mental
distress
has
a
reducing
congealing
effect
and
mayor
sluss
seemed
somewhat
less
than
his
usual
self
in
height
weight
and
thickness
cowperwood
had
seen
him
more
than
once
on
various
political
platforms
but
he
had
never
met
him
when
the
troubled
mayor
entered
he
arose
courteously
and
waved
him
to
a
chair
sit
down
sluss
he
said
genially
it
a
disagreeable
day
out
is
it
i
suppose
you
have
come
in
regard
to
the
matter
we
were
discussing
this
morning
nor
was
this
cordiality
wholly
assumed
one
of
the
primal
instincts
of
cowperwood
nature
for
all
his
chicane
and
subtlety
was
to
take
no
rough
advantage
of
a
beaten
enemy
in
the
hour
of
victory
he
was
always
courteous
bland
gentle
and
even
sympathetic
he
was
so
and
quite
honestly
too
mayor
sluss
put
down
the
high
hat
he
wore
and
said
grandiosely
as
was
his
manner
even
in
the
direst
extremity
well
you
see
i
am
here
cowperwood
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
exactly
nothing
unreasonable
i
assure
you
sluss
replied
cowperwood
your
manner
to
me
this
morning
was
a
little
brusque
and
as
i
have
always
wanted
to
have
a
sensible
private
talk
with
you
i
took
this
way
of
getting
it
i
should
like
you
to
dismiss
from
your
mind
at
once
the
thought
that
i
am
going
to
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
you
in
any
way
i
have
no
present
intention
of
publishing
your
correspondence
with
mrs
brandon
as
he
said
this
he
took
from
his
drawer
a
bundle
of
letters
which
mayor
sluss
recognized
at
once
as
the
enthusiastic
missives
which
he
had
sometime
before
penned
to
the
fair
claudia
sluss
groaned
as
he
beheld
this
incriminating
evidence
i
am
not
trying
continued
cowperwood
to
wreck
your
career
nor
to
make
you
do
anything
which
you
do
not
feel
that
you
can
conscientiously
undertake
the
letters
that
i
have
here
let
me
say
have
come
to
me
quite
by
accident
i
did
not
seek
them
but
since
i
do
have
them
i
thought
i
might
as
well
mention
them
as
a
basis
for
a
possible
talk
and
compromise
between
us
cowperwood
did
not
smile
he
merely
looked
thoughtfully
at
sluss
then
by
way
of
testifying
to
the
truthfulness
of
what
he
had
been
saying
thumped
the
letters
up
and
down
just
to
show
that
they
were
real
yes
said
sluss
heavily
i
see
he
studied
the
bundle
a
small
solid
affair
while
cowperwood
looked
discreetly
elsewhere
he
contemplated
his
own
shoes
the
floor
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
then
his
knees
cowperwood
saw
how
completely
he
had
collapsed
it
was
ridiculous
pitiable
come
sluss
said
cowperwood
amiably
cheer
up
things
are
not
nearly
as
desperate
as
you
think
i
give
you
my
word
right
now
that
nothing
which
you
yourself
on
mature
thought
could
say
was
unfair
will
be
done
you
are
the
mayor
of
chicago
i
am
a
citizen
i
merely
wish
fair
play
from
you
i
merely
ask
you
to
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
from
now
on
you
will
take
no
part
in
this
fight
which
is
one
of
pure
spite
against
me
if
you
can
not
conscientiously
aid
me
in
what
i
consider
to
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
demand
for
additional
franchises
you
will
at
least
not
go
out
of
your
way
to
publicly
attack
me
i
will
put
these
letters
in
my
safe
and
there
they
will
stay
until
the
next
campaign
is
over
when
i
will
take
them
out
and
destroy
them
i
have
no
personal
feeling
against
you
none
in
the
world
i
do
not
ask
you
to
sign
any
ordinance
which
the
council
may
pass
giving
me
rights
what
i
do
wish
you
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
refrain
from
stirring
up
public
sentiment
against
me
especially
if
the
council
should
see
fit
to
pass
an
ordinance
over
your
veto
is
that
satisfactory
but
my
friends
the
public
the
republican
party
do
you
see
it
is
expected
of
me
that
i
should
wage
some
form
of
campaign
against
you
queried
sluss
nervously
no
i
do
replied
cowperwood
succinctly
and
anyhow
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
waging
a
public
campaign
go
through
the
motions
if
you
wish
but
do
put
too
much
heart
in
it
and
anyhow
see
some
one
of
my
lawyers
from
time
to
time
when
they
call
on
you
judge
dickensheets
is
an
able
and
fair
man
so
is
general
van
sickle
why
not
confer
with
them
occasionally
not
publicly
of
course
but
in
some
less
conspicuous
way
you
will
find
both
of
them
most
helpful
cowperwood
smiled
encouragingly
quite
beneficently
and
chaffee
thayer
sluss
his
political
hopes
gone
glimmering
sat
and
mused
for
a
few
moments
in
a
sad
and
helpless
quandary
very
well
he
said
at
last
rubbing
his
hands
feverishly
it
is
what
i
might
have
expected
i
should
have
known
there
is
no
other
way
but
hardly
able
to
repress
the
hot
tears
now
burning
beneath
his
eyelids
the
hon
sluss
picked
up
his
hat
and
left
the
room
needless
to
add
that
his
preachings
against
cowperwood
were
permanently
silenced
chapter
xlv
changing
horizons
the
effect
of
all
this
was
to
arouse
in
cowperwood
the
keenest
feelings
of
superiority
he
had
ever
yet
enjoyed
hitherto
he
had
fancied
that
his
enemies
might
worst
him
but
at
last
his
path
seemed
clear
he
was
now
worth
all
in
all
the
round
sum
of
twenty
million
dollars
his
had
become
the
most
important
in
the
west
perhaps
in
the
nation
public
collections
excluded
he
began
to
envision
himself
as
a
national
figure
possibly
even
an
international
one
and
yet
he
was
coming
to
feel
that
no
matter
how
complete
his
financial
victory
might
ultimately
be
the
chances
were
that
he
and
aileen
would
never
be
socially
accepted
here
in
chicago
he
had
done
too
many
boisterous
things
alienated
too
many
people
he
was
as
determined
as
ever
to
retain
a
firm
grip
on
the
chicago
situation
but
he
was
disturbed
for
a
second
time
in
his
life
by
the
thought
that
owing
to
the
complexities
of
his
own
temperament
he
had
married
unhappily
and
would
find
the
situation
difficult
of
adjustment
aileen
whatever
might
be
said
of
her
deficiencies
was
by
no
means
as
tractable
or
acquiescent
as
his
first
wife
and
besides
he
felt
that
he
owed
her
a
better
turn
by
no
means
did
he
actually
dislike
her
as
yet
though
she
was
no
longer
soothing
stimulating
or
suggestive
to
him
as
she
had
formerly
been
her
woes
because
of
him
were
too
many
her
attitude
toward
him
too
censorious
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
sympathize
with
her
to
regret
his
own
change
of
feeling
but
what
would
you
he
could
not
control
his
own
temperament
any
more
than
aileen
could
control
hers
the
worst
of
this
situation
was
that
it
was
now
becoming
complicated
on
cowperwood
part
with
the
most
disturbing
thoughts
concerning
berenice
fleming
ever
since
the
days
when
he
had
first
met
her
mother
he
had
been
coming
more
and
more
to
feel
for
the
young
girl
a
passion
and
that
without
a
single
look
exchanged
or
a
single
word
spoken
there
is
a
static
something
which
is
beauty
and
this
may
be
clothed
in
the
habiliments
of
a
ragged
philosopher
or
in
the
silks
and
satins
of
pampered
coquetry
it
was
a
suggestion
of
this
beauty
which
is
above
sex
and
above
age
and
above
wealth
that
shone
in
the
blowing
hair
and
eyes
of
berenice
fleming
his
visit
to
the
carter
family
at
pocono
had
been
a
disappointment
to
him
because
of
the
apparent
hopelessness
of
arousing
berenice
interest
and
since
that
time
and
during
their
casual
encounters
she
had
remained
politely
indifferent
nevertheless
he
remained
true
to
his
persistence
in
the
pursuit
of
any
game
he
had
fixed
upon
carter
whose
relations
with
cowperwood
had
in
the
past
been
not
wholly
platonic
nevertheless
attributed
much
of
his
interest
in
her
to
her
children
and
their
vital
chance
berenice
and
rolfe
themselves
knew
nothing
concerning
the
nature
of
their
mother
arrangements
with
cowperwood
true
to
his
promise
of
protectorship
and
assistance
he
had
established
her
in
a
new
york
apartment
adjacent
to
her
school
and
where
he
fancied
that
he
himself
might
spend
many
happy
hours
were
berenice
but
near
proximity
to
berenice
the
desire
to
arouse
her
interest
and
command
her
favor
cowperwood
would
scarcely
have
cared
to
admit
to
himself
how
great
a
part
this
played
in
a
thought
which
had
recently
been
creeping
into
his
mind
it
was
that
of
erecting
a
splendid
house
in
new
york
by
degrees
this
idea
of
building
a
new
york
house
had
grown
upon
him
his
chicago
mansion
was
a
costly
sepulcher
in
which
aileen
sat
brooding
over
the
woes
which
had
befallen
her
moreover
aside
from
the
social
defeat
which
it
represented
it
was
becoming
merely
as
a
structure
but
poorly
typical
of
the
splendor
and
ability
of
his
imaginations
this
second
dwelling
if
he
ever
achieved
it
should
be
resplendent
a
monument
to
himself
in
his
speculative
wanderings
abroad
he
had
seen
many
such
great
palaces
designed
with
the
utmost
care
which
had
housed
the
taste
and
culture
of
generations
of
men
his
in
which
he
took
an
immense
pride
had
been
growing
until
it
was
the
basis
if
not
the
completed
substance
for
a
very
splendid
memorial
already
in
it
were
gathered
paintings
of
all
the
important
schools
to
say
nothing
of
collections
of
jade
illumined
missals
porcelains
rugs
draperies
mirror
frames
and
a
beginning
at
rare
originals
of
sculpture
the
beauty
of
these
strange
things
the
patient
laborings
of
inspired
souls
of
various
times
and
places
moved
him
on
occasion
to
a
gentle
awe
of
all
individuals
he
respected
indeed
revered
the
sincere
artist
existence
was
a
mystery
but
these
souls
who
set
themselves
to
quiet
tasks
of
beauty
had
caught
something
of
which
he
was
dimly
conscious
life
had
touched
them
with
a
vision
their
hearts
and
souls
were
attuned
to
sweet
harmonies
of
which
the
common
world
knew
nothing
sometimes
when
he
was
weary
after
a
strenuous
day
he
would
enter
late
in
the
night
his
now
silent
gallery
and
turning
on
the
lights
so
that
the
whole
sweet
room
stood
revealed
he
would
seat
himself
before
some
treasure
reflecting
on
the
nature
the
mood
the
time
and
the
man
that
had
produced
it
sometimes
it
would
be
one
of
rembrandt
melancholy
heads
the
sad
portrait
of
a
rabbi
or
the
sweet
introspection
of
a
rousseau
stream
a
solemn
dutch
housewife
rendered
with
the
bold
fidelity
and
resonant
enameled
surfaces
of
a
hals
or
the
cold
elegance
of
an
ingres
commanded
his
utmost
enthusiasm
so
he
would
sit
and
wonder
at
the
vision
and
skill
of
the
original
dreamer
exclaiming
at
times
a
marvel
a
marvel
at
the
same
time
so
far
as
aileen
was
concerned
things
were
obviously
shaping
up
for
additional
changes
she
was
in
that
peculiar
state
which
has
befallen
many
a
woman
trying
to
substitute
a
lesser
ideal
for
a
greater
and
finding
that
the
effort
is
useless
or
nearly
so
in
regard
to
her
affair
with
lynde
aside
from
the
temporary
relief
and
diversion
it
had
afforded
her
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
she
had
made
a
serious
mistake
lynde
was
delightful
after
his
fashion
he
could
amuse
her
with
a
different
type
of
experience
from
any
that
cowperwood
had
to
relate
once
they
were
intimate
he
had
with
an
easy
genial
air
confessed
to
all
sorts
of
liaisons
in
europe
and
america
he
was
utterly
pagan
a
faun
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
truly
of
the
smart
world
his
open
contempt
of
all
but
one
or
two
of
the
people
in
chicago
whom
aileen
had
secretly
admired
and
wished
to
associate
with
and
his
easy
references
to
figures
of
importance
in
the
east
and
in
paris
and
london
raised
him
amazingly
in
her
estimation
it
made
her
feel
sad
to
relate
that
she
had
by
no
means
lowered
herself
in
succumbing
so
readily
to
his
forceful
charms
nevertheless
because
he
was
what
he
was
genial
complimentary
affectionate
but
a
playboy
merely
and
a
soldier
of
fortune
with
no
desire
to
make
over
her
life
for
her
on
any
new
basis
she
was
now
grieving
over
the
futility
of
this
romance
which
had
got
her
nowhere
and
which
in
all
probability
had
alienated
cowperwood
for
good
he
was
still
outwardly
genial
and
friendly
but
their
relationship
was
now
colored
by
a
sense
of
mistake
and
uncertainty
which
existed
on
both
sides
but
which
in
aileen
case
amounted
to
a
subtle
species
of
hitherto
she
had
been
the
aggrieved
one
the
one
whose
loyalty
had
never
been
in
question
and
whose
persistent
affection
and
faith
had
been
greatly
sinned
against
now
all
this
was
changed
the
manner
in
which
he
had
sinned
against
her
was
plain
enough
but
the
way
in
which
out
of
pique
she
had
forsaken
him
was
in
the
other
balance
say
what
one
will
the
loyalty
of
woman
whether
a
condition
in
nature
or
an
evolved
accident
of
sociology
persists
as
a
dominating
thought
in
at
least
a
section
of
the
race
and
women
themselves
be
it
said
are
the
ones
who
most
loudly
and
openly
subscribe
to
it
cowperwood
himself
was
fully
aware
that
aileen
had
deserted
him
not
because
she
loved
him
less
or
lynde
more
but
because
she
was
hurt
and
deeply
so
aileen
knew
that
he
knew
this
from
one
point
of
view
it
enraged
her
and
made
her
defiant
from
another
it
grieved
her
to
think
she
had
uselessly
sinned
against
his
faith
in
her
now
he
had
ample
excuse
to
do
anything
he
chose
her
best
claim
on
him
her
wounds
she
had
thrown
away
as
one
throws
away
a
weapon
her
pride
would
not
let
her
talk
to
him
about
this
and
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
endure
the
easy
tolerant
manner
with
which
he
took
it
his
smiles
his
forgiveness
his
sometimes
pleasant
jesting
were
all
a
horrible
offense
to
complete
her
mental
quandary
she
was
already
beginning
to
quarrel
with
lynde
over
this
matter
of
her
unbreakable
regard
for
cowperwood
with
the
sufficiency
of
a
man
of
the
world
lynde
intended
that
she
should
succumb
to
him
completely
and
forget
her
wonderful
husband
when
with
him
she
was
apparently
charmed
and
interested
yielding
herself
freely
but
this
was
more
out
of
pique
at
cowperwood
neglect
than
from
any
genuine
passion
for
lynde
in
spite
of
her
pretensions
of
anger
her
sneers
and
criticisms
whenever
cowperwood
name
came
up
she
was
nevertheless
hopelessly
fond
of
him
and
identified
with
him
spiritually
and
it
was
not
long
before
lynde
began
to
suspect
this
such
a
discovery
is
a
sad
one
for
any
master
of
women
to
make
it
jolted
his
pride
severely
you
care
for
him
still
do
you
he
asked
with
a
wry
smile
upon
one
occasion
they
were
sitting
at
dinner
in
a
private
room
at
kinsley
and
aileen
whose
color
was
high
and
who
was
becomingly
garbed
in
silk
was
looking
especially
handsome
lynde
had
been
proposing
that
she
should
make
special
arrangements
to
depart
with
him
for
a
stay
in
europe
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
project
she
did
not
dare
such
a
move
would
make
cowperwood
feel
that
she
was
alienating
herself
forever
it
would
give
him
an
excellent
excuse
to
leave
her
oh
it
is
that
she
had
declared
in
reply
to
lynde
query
i
just
do
want
to
go
i
ca
i
not
prepared
it
nothing
but
a
notion
of
yours
anyhow
you
tired
of
chicago
because
it
getting
near
spring
you
go
and
i
be
here
when
you
come
back
or
i
may
decide
to
come
over
later
she
smiled
lynde
pulled
a
dark
face
hell
he
said
i
know
how
it
is
with
you
you
still
stick
to
him
even
when
he
treats
you
like
a
dog
you
pretend
not
to
love
him
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
mad
about
him
i
seen
it
all
along
you
do
really
care
anything
about
me
you
ca
you
too
crazy
about
him
oh
shut
up
replied
aileen
irritated
greatly
for
the
moment
by
this
onslaught
you
talk
like
a
fool
i
not
anything
of
the
sort
i
admire
him
how
could
any
one
help
it
at
this
time
of
course
cowperwood
name
was
filling
the
city
he
a
very
wonderful
man
he
was
never
brutal
to
me
he
a
man
i
say
that
for
him
by
now
aileen
had
become
sufficiently
familiar
with
lynde
to
criticize
him
in
her
own
mind
and
even
outwardly
by
innuendo
for
being
a
loafer
and
idler
who
had
never
created
in
any
way
the
money
he
was
so
freely
spending
she
had
little
power
to
psychologize
concerning
social
conditions
but
the
stalwart
constructive
persistence
of
cowperwood
along
commercial
lines
coupled
with
the
current
american
contempt
of
leisure
reflected
somewhat
unfavorably
upon
lynde
she
thought
lynde
face
clouded
still
more
at
this
outburst
you
go
to
the
devil
he
retorted
i
do
get
you
at
all
sometimes
you
talk
as
though
you
were
fond
of
me
at
other
times
you
all
wrapped
up
in
him
now
you
either
care
for
me
or
you
do
which
is
it
if
so
crazy
about
him
that
you
ca
leave
home
for
a
month
or
so
you
certainly
ca
care
much
about
me
aileen
however
because
of
her
long
experience
with
cowperwood
was
more
than
a
match
for
lynde
at
the
same
time
she
was
afraid
to
let
go
of
him
for
fear
that
she
should
have
no
one
to
care
for
her
she
liked
him
he
was
a
happy
resource
in
her
misery
at
least
for
the
moment
yet
the
knowledge
that
cowperwood
looked
upon
this
affair
as
a
heavy
blemish
on
her
pristine
solidarity
cooled
her
at
the
thought
of
him
and
of
her
whole
tarnished
and
troubled
career
she
was
very
unhappy
hell
lynde
had
repeated
irritably
stay
if
you
want
to
i
not
be
trying
to
you
depend
on
that
they
quarreled
still
further
over
this
matter
and
though
they
eventually
made
up
both
sensed
the
drift
toward
an
ultimately
unsatisfactory
conclusion
it
was
one
morning
not
long
after
this
that
cowperwood
feeling
in
a
genial
mood
over
his
affairs
came
into
aileen
room
as
he
still
did
on
occasions
to
finish
dressing
and
pass
the
time
of
day
well
he
observed
gaily
as
he
stood
before
the
mirror
adjusting
his
collar
and
tie
how
are
you
and
lynde
getting
along
these
days
nicely
oh
you
go
to
the
devil
replied
aileen
flaring
up
and
struggling
with
her
divided
feelings
which
pained
her
constantly
if
it
been
for
you
there
would
be
any
chance
for
your
smarty
i
am
getting
along
all
right
fine
regardless
of
anything
you
may
think
he
as
good
a
man
as
you
are
any
day
and
better
i
like
him
at
least
he
fond
of
me
and
that
more
than
you
are
why
should
you
care
what
i
do
you
do
so
why
talk
about
it
i
want
you
to
let
me
alone
aileen
aileen
how
you
carry
on
do
flare
up
so
i
meant
nothing
by
it
i
sorry
as
much
for
myself
as
for
you
i
told
you
i
not
jealous
you
think
i
critical
i
not
anything
of
the
kind
i
know
how
you
feel
that
all
very
good
oh
yes
yes
she
replied
well
you
can
keep
your
feelings
to
yourself
go
to
the
devil
go
to
the
devil
i
tell
you
her
eyes
blazed
he
stood
now
fully
dressed
in
the
center
of
the
rug
before
her
and
aileen
looked
at
him
keen
valiant
handsome
her
old
frank
once
again
she
regretted
her
nominal
faithlessness
and
raged
at
him
in
her
heart
for
his
indifference
you
dog
she
was
about
to
add
you
have
no
heart
but
she
changed
her
mind
her
throat
tightened
and
her
eyes
filled
she
wanted
to
run
to
him
and
say
oh
frank
do
you
understand
how
it
all
is
how
it
all
came
about
wo
you
love
me
again
ca
you
but
she
restrained
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
might
understand
that
he
would
in
fact
but
that
he
would
never
again
be
faithful
anyhow
and
she
would
so
gladly
have
discarded
lynde
and
any
and
all
men
if
he
would
only
have
said
the
word
would
only
have
really
and
sincerely
wished
her
to
do
so
it
was
one
day
not
long
after
their
morning
quarrel
in
her
bedroom
that
cowperwood
broached
the
matter
of
living
in
new
york
to
aileen
pointing
out
that
thereby
his
which
was
growing
constantly
might
be
more
suitably
housed
and
that
it
would
give
her
a
second
opportunity
to
enter
social
life
so
that
you
can
get
rid
of
me
out
here
commented
aileen
little
knowing
of
berenice
fleming
not
at
all
replied
cowperwood
sweetly
you
see
how
things
are
there
no
chance
of
our
getting
into
chicago
society
there
too
much
financial
opposition
against
me
here
if
we
had
a
big
house
in
new
york
such
as
i
would
build
it
would
be
an
introduction
in
itself
after
all
these
chicagoans
are
even
a
snapper
on
the
real
society
whip
it
the
easterners
who
set
the
pace
and
the
most
of
all
if
you
want
to
say
the
word
i
can
sell
this
place
and
we
can
live
down
there
part
of
the
time
anyhow
i
could
spend
as
much
of
my
time
with
you
there
as
i
have
been
doing
here
perhaps
more
because
of
her
soul
of
vanity
aileen
mind
ran
forward
in
spite
of
herself
to
the
wider
opportunities
which
his
words
suggested
this
house
had
become
a
nightmare
to
her
a
place
of
neglect
and
bad
memories
here
she
had
fought
with
rita
sohlberg
here
she
had
seen
society
come
for
a
very
little
while
only
to
disappear
here
she
had
waited
this
long
time
for
the
renewal
of
cowperwood
love
which
was
now
obviously
never
to
be
restored
in
its
original
glamour
as
he
spoke
she
looked
at
him
quizzically
almost
sadly
in
her
great
doubt
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
help
reflecting
that
in
new
york
where
money
counted
for
so
much
and
with
cowperwood
great
and
growing
wealth
and
prestige
behind
her
she
might
hope
to
find
herself
socially
at
last
nothing
venture
nothing
have
had
always
been
her
motto
nailed
to
her
mast
though
her
equipment
for
the
life
she
now
craved
had
never
been
more
than
the
veriest
painted
wood
and
tinsel
vain
radiant
hopeful
aileen
yet
how
was
she
to
know
very
well
she
observed
finally
do
as
you
like
i
can
live
down
there
as
well
as
i
can
here
i
presume
alone
cowperwood
knew
the
nature
of
her
longings
he
knew
what
was
running
in
her
mind
and
how
futile
were
her
dreams
life
had
taught
him
how
fortuitous
must
be
the
circumstances
which
could
enable
a
woman
of
aileen
handicaps
and
defects
to
enter
that
cold
upper
world
yet
for
all
the
courage
of
him
for
the
very
life
of
him
he
could
not
tell
her
he
could
not
forget
that
once
behind
the
grim
bars
in
the
penitentiary
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
he
had
cried
on
her
shoulder
he
could
not
be
an
ingrate
and
wound
her
with
his
inmost
thoughts
any
more
than
he
could
deceive
himself
a
new
york
mansion
and
the
dreams
of
social
supremacy
which
she
might
there
entertain
would
soothe
her
ruffled
vanity
and
assuage
her
disappointed
heart
and
at
the
same
time
he
would
be
nearer
berenice
fleming
say
what
one
will
of
these
ferret
windings
of
the
human
mind
they
are
nevertheless
true
and
characteristic
of
the
average
human
being
and
cowperwood
was
no
exception
he
saw
it
all
he
calculated
on
it
he
calculated
on
the
simple
humanity
of
aileen
chapter
xlvi
depths
and
heights
the
complications
which
had
followed
his
various
sentimental
affairs
left
cowperwood
in
a
quandary
at
times
as
to
whether
there
could
be
any
peace
or
satisfaction
outside
of
monogamy
after
all
although
hand
had
gone
to
europe
at
the
crisis
of
her
affairs
she
had
returned
to
seek
him
out
cecily
haguenin
found
many
opportunities
of
writing
him
letters
and
assuring
him
of
her
undying
affection
florence
cochrane
persisted
in
seeing
or
attempting
to
see
him
even
after
his
interest
in
her
began
to
wane
for
another
thing
aileen
owing
to
the
complication
and
general
degeneracy
of
her
affairs
had
recently
begun
to
drink
owing
to
the
failure
of
her
affair
with
lynde
for
in
spite
of
her
yielding
she
had
never
had
any
real
heart
interest
in
it
and
to
the
cavalier
attitude
with
which
cowperwood
took
her
disloyalty
she
had
reached
that
state
of
speculative
doldrums
where
the
human
animal
turns
upon
itself
in
bitter
the
end
with
the
more
sensitive
or
the
less
durable
is
dissipation
or
even
death
woe
to
him
who
places
his
faith
in
illusion
the
only
reality
and
woe
to
him

disillusion
with
its

regret
after
lynde
departure
for

whither
she
had
refused
to
follow
him
aileen
took
up
with
a
secondary
personage
by
the
name
of
watson
skeet
a
sculptor
unlike
most
artists
he
was
the
solitary
heir
of
the
president
of
an
immense
company
in
which
he
refused
to
take
any
interest
he
had
studied
abroad
but
had
returned
to
chicago
with
a
view
to
propagating
art
in
the
west
a
large
blond
man
he
had
a
kind
of
archaic
naturalness
and
simplicity
which
appealed
to
aileen
they
had
met
at
the
rhees
griers
feeling
herself
neglected
after
lynde
departure
and
dreading
loneliness
above
all
things
aileen
became
intimate
with
skeet
but
to
no
intense
mental
satisfaction
that
driving
standard
within
that
obsessing
ideal
which
requires
that
all
things
be
measured
by
it
was
still
dominant
who
has
not
experienced
the
chilling
memory
of
the
better
thing
how
it
creeps
over
the
spirit
of
one
current
dreams
like
the
specter
at
the
banquet
it
stands
its
substanceless
eyes
viewing
with
a
sad
philosophy
the
makeshift
feast
the
of
her
life
with
cowperwood
walked
side
by
side
with
her
wherever
she
went
once
occasionally
indulging
in
cigarettes
she
now
smoked
almost
constantly
once
barely
sipping
at
wines
cocktails
she
now
took
to
the
latter
or
rather
to
a
new
combination
known
as
highball
with
a
kind
of
vehemence
which
had
little
to
do
with
a
taste
for
the
thing
itself
true
drinking
is
after
all
a
state
of
mind
and
not
an
appetite
she
had
found
on
a
number
of
occasions
when
she
had
been
quarreling
with
lynde
or
was
mentally
depressed
that
in
partaking
of
these
drinks
a
sort
of
warm
speculative
indifference
seized
upon
her
she
was
no
longer
so
sad
she
might
cry
but
it
was
in
a
soft
rainy
relieving
way
her
sorrows
were
as
strange
enticing
figures
in
dreams
they
moved
about
and
around
her
not
as
things
actually
identical
with
her
but
as
ills
which
she
could
view
at
a
distance
sometimes
both
she
and
they
for
she
saw
herself
also
as
in
a
kind
of
mirage
or
inverted
vision
seemed
beings
of
another
state
troubled
but
not
bitterly
painful
the
old
nepenthe
of
the
bottle
had
seized
upon
her
after
a
few
accidental
lapses
in
which
she
found
it
acted
as
a
solace
or
sedative
the
highball
visioned
itself
to
her
as
a
resource
why
should
she
not
drink
if
it
relieved
her
as
it
actually
did
of
physical
and
mental
pain
there
were
apparently
no
bad
the
whisky
involved
was
diluted
to
an
almost
watery
state
it
was
her
custom
now
when
at
home
alone
to
go
to
the
pantry
where
the
liquors
were
stored
and
prepare
a
drink
for
herself
or
to
order
a
tray
with
a
siphon
and
bottle
placed
in
her
room
cowperwood
noticing
the
persistence
of
its
presence
there
and
the
fact
that
she
drank
heavily
at
table
commented
upon
it
you
not
taking
too
much
of
that
are
you
aileen
he
questioned
one
evening
watching
her
drink
down
a
tumbler
of
whisky
and
water
as
she
sat
contemplating
a
pattern
of
needlework
with
which
the
table
was
ornamented
certainly
i
not
she
replied
irritably
a
little
flushed
and
thick
of
tongue
why
do
you
ask
she
herself
had
been
wondering
whether
in
the
course
of
time
it
might
not
have
a
depreciating
effect
on
her
complexion
this
was
the
only
thing
that
still
concerned
her
her
beauty
well
i
see
you
have
that
bottle
in
your
room
all
the
time
i
was
wondering
if
you
might
not
be
forgetting
how
much
you
are
using
it
because
she
was
so
sensitive
he
was
trying
to
be
tactful
well
she
answered
crossly
what
if
i
am
it
would
make
any
particular
difference
if
i
did
i
might
as
well
drink
as
do
some
other
things
that
are
done
it
was
a
kind
of
satisfaction
to
her
to
bait
him
in
this
way
his
inquiry
being
a
proof
of
continued
interest
on
his
part
was
of
some
value
at
least
he
was
not
entirely
indifferent
to
her
i
wish
you
would
talk
that
way
aileen
he
replied
i
have
no
objection
to
your
drinking
some
i
do
suppose
it
makes
any
difference
to
you
now
whether
i
object
or
not
but
you
are
too
too
well
set
up
physically
to
begin
that
you
need
it
and
it
such
a
short
road
to
hell
your
state
is
so
bad
good
heavens
many
another
woman
has
been
in
your
position
i
not
going
to
leave
you
unless
you
want
to
leave
me
i
told
you
that
over
and
over
i
just
sorry
people
change
we
all
do
i
suppose
i
changed
some
but
that
no
reason
for
your
letting
yourself
go
to
pieces
i
wish
you
would
be
desperate
about
this
business
it
may
come
out
better
than
you
think
in
the
long
run
he
was
merely
talking
to
console
her
oh
oh
oh
aileen
suddenly
began
to
rock
and
cry
in
a
foolish
drunken
way
as
though
her
heart
would
break
and
cowperwood
got
up
he
was
horrified
after
a
fashion
oh
do
come
near
me
aileen
suddenly
exclaimed
sobering
in
an
equally
strange
way
i
know
why
you
come
i
know
how
much
you
care
about
me
or
my
looks
do
you
worry
whether
i
drink
or
not
drink
if
i
please
or
do
anything
else
if
i
choose
if
it
helps
me
over
my
difficulties
that
my
business
not
yours
and
in
defiance
she
prepared
another
glass
and
drank
it
cowperwood
shook
his
head
looking
at
her
steadily
and
sorrowfully
it
too
bad
aileen
he
said
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
you
exactly
you
ought
to
go
on
this
way
whisky
wo
get
you
anywhere
it
will
simply
ruin
your
looks
and
make
you
miserable
in
the
bargain
oh
to
hell
with
my
looks
she
snapped
a
lot
of
good
they
done
me
and
feeling
contentious
and
sad
she
got
up
and
left
the
table
cowperwood
followed
her
after
a
time
only
to
see
her
dabbing
at
her
eyes
and
nose
with
powder
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
was
on
the
beside
her
it
gave
him
a
strange
feeling
of
responsibility
and
helplessness
mingled
with
his
anxiety
as
to
aileen
were
thoughts
of
the
alternate
rise
and
fall
of
his
hopes
in
connection
with
berenice
she
was
such
a
superior
girl
developing
so
definitely
as
an
individual
to
his
satisfaction
she
had
on
a
few
recent
occasions
when
he
had
seen
her
unbent
sufficiently
to
talk
to
him
in
a
friendly
and
even
intimate
way
for
she
was
by
no
means
but
a
thinking
reasoning
being
of
the
profoundest
intellectual
or
rather
the
highest
artistic
tendencies
she
was
so
living
in
a
high
and
solitary
world
at
times
apparently
enwrapt
in
thoughts
serene
at
other
times
sharing
vividly
in
the
current
interests
of
the
social
world
of
which
she
was
a
part
and
which
she
dignified
as
much
as
it
dignified
her
one
sunday
morning
at
pocono
in
late
june
weather
when
he
had
come
east
to
rest
for
a
few
days
and
all
was
still
and
airy
on
the
high
ground
which
the
carter
cottage
occupied
berenice
came
out
on
the
veranda
where
cowperwood
was
sitting
reading
a
fiscal
report
of
one
of
his
companies
and
meditating
on
his
affairs
by
now
they
had
become
somewhat
more
sympatica
than
formerly
and
berenice
had
an
easy
genial
way
in
his
presence
she
liked
him
rather
with
an
indescribable
smile
which
wrinkled
her
nose
and
eyes
and
played
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
she
said
now
i
am
going
to
catch
a
bird
a
what
asked
cowperwood
looking
up
and
pretending
he
had
not
heard
though
he
had
he
was
all
eyes
for
any
movement
of
hers
she
was
dressed
in
a
flouncy
morning
gown
eminently
suitable
for
the
world
in
which
she
was
moving
a
bird
she
replied
with
an
airy
toss
of
her
head
this
is
and
the
sparrows
are
teaching
their
young
to
fly
cowperwood
previously
engrossed
in
financial
speculations
was
translated
as
by
the
wave
of
a
fairy
wand
into
another
realm
where
birds
and
fledglings
and
grass
and
the
light
winds
of
heaven
were
more
important
than
brick
and
stone
and
stocks
and
bonds
he
got
up
and
followed
her
flowing
steps
across
the
grass
to
where
near
a
clump
of
alder
bushes
she
had
seen
a
mother
sparrow
enticing
a
fledgling
to
take
wing
from
her
room
upstairs
she
had
been
watching
this
bit
of
outdoor
sociology
it
suddenly
came
to
cowperwood
with
great
force
how
comparatively
unimportant
in
the
great
drift
of
life
were
his
own
affairs
when
about
him
was
operative
all
this
splendid
will
to
existence
as
sensed
by
her
he
saw
her
stretch
out
her
hands
downward
and
run
in
an
airy
graceful
way
stooping
here
and
there
while
before
her
fluttered
a
baby
sparrow
until
suddenly
she
dived
quickly
and
then
turning
her
face
agleam
cried
see
i
have
him
he
wants
to
fight
too
oh
you
little
dear
she
was
holding
him
as
she
chose
to
characterize
it
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
the
head
between
her
thumb
and
forefinger
with
the
forefinger
of
her
free
hand
petting
it
the
while
she
laughed
and
kissed
it
it
was
not
so
much
as
the
artistry
of
life
and
of
herself
that
was
moving
her
hearing
the
parent
bird
chirping
distractedly
from
a
nearby
limb
she
turned
and
called
do
make
such
a
row
i
keep
him
long
cowperwood
laughed
trig
in
the
morning
sun
you
can
scarcely
blame
her
he
commented
oh
she
knows
well
enough
i
would
hurt
him
berenice
replied
spiritedly
as
though
it
were
literally
true
does
she
indeed
inquired
cowperwood
why
do
you
say
that
because
it
true
do
you
think
they
know
when
their
children
are
really
in
danger
but
why
should
they
persisted
cowperwood
charmed
and
interested
by
the
involute
character
of
her
logic
she
was
quite
deceptive
to
him
he
could
not
be
sure
what
she
thought
she
merely
fixed
him
a
moment
with
her
cool
eyes
do
you
think
the
senses
of
the
world
are
only
five
she
asked
in
the
most
charming
and
way
indeed
they
know
well
enough
she
knows
she
turned
and
waved
a
graceful
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
tree
where
peace
now
reigned
the
chirping
had
ceased
she
knows
i
am
not
a
cat
again
that
enticing
mocking
smile
that
wrinkled
her
nose
her
her
mouth
the
word
cat
had
a
sharp
sweet
sound
in
her
mouth
it
seemed
to
be
bitten
off
closely
with
force
and
airy
spirit
cowperwood
surveyed
her
as
he
would
have
surveyed
the
ablest
person
he
knew
here
was
a
woman
he
saw
who
could
and
would
command
the
utmost
reaches
of
his
soul
in
every
direction
if
he
interested
her
at
all
he
would
need
them
all
the
eyes
of
her
were
at
once
so
elusive
so
direct
so
friendly
so
cool
and
keen
you
will
have
to
be
interesting
indeed
to
interest
me
they
seemed
to
say
and
yet
they
were
by
no
means
averse
apparently
to
a
hearty
camaraderie
that
smile
said
as
much
here
was
by
no
means
a
stephanie
platow
nor
yet
a
rita
sohlberg
he
could
not
assume
her
as
he
had
ella
hubby
or
florence
cochrane
or
cecily
haguenin
here
was
an
iron
individuality
with
a
soul
for
romance
and
art
and
philosophy
and
life
he
could
not
take
her
as
he
had
those
others
and
yet
berenice
was
really
beginning
to
think
more
than
a
little
about
cowperwood
he
must
be
an
extraordinary
man
her
mother
said
so
and
the
newspapers
were
always
mentioning
his
name
and
noting
his
movements
a
little
later
at
southampton
whither
she
and
her
mother
had
gone
they
met
again
together
with
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
greanelle
cowperwood
and
berenice
had
gone
into
the
sea
to
bathe
it
was
a
wonderful
afternoon
to
the
east
and
south
and
west
spread
the
sea
a
crinkling
floor
of
blue
and
to
their
left
as
they
faced
it
was
a
lovely
shore
of
tawny
sand
studying
berenice
in
bathing
costume
and
shoes
cowperwood
had
been
stung
by
the
wonder
of
passing
life
how
youth
comes
in
ever
fresh
and
fresh
and
age
goes
out
here
he
was
long
crowded
years
of
conflict
and
experience
behind
him
and
yet
this
girl
with
her
incisive
mind
and
keen
tastes
was
apparently
as
wise
in
matters
of
general
import
as
himself
he
could
find
no
flaw
in
her
armor
in
those
matters
which
they
could
discuss
her
knowledge
and
comments
were
so
ripe
and
sane
despite
a
tendency
to
pose
a
little
which
was
quite
within
her
rights
because
greanelle
had
bored
her
a
little
she
had
shunted
him
off
and
was
amusing
herself
talking
to
cowperwood
who
fascinated
her
by
his
compact
individuality
do
you
know
she
confided
to
him
on
this
occasion
i
get
so
very
tired
of
young
men
sometimes
they
can
be
so
inane
i
do
declare
they
are
nothing
more
than
shoes
and
ties
and
socks
and
canes
strung
together
in
some
unimaginable
way
vaughn
greanelle
is
for
all
the
world
like
a
perambulating
manikin
he
is
just
an
english
suit
with
a
cane
attached
walking
about
well
bless
my
soul
commented
cowperwood
what
an
indictment
it
true
she
replied
he
knows
nothing
at
all
except
polo
and
the
latest
and
where
everybody
is
and
who
is
going
to
marry
who
is
it
dull
she
tossed
her
head
back
and
breathed
as
though
to
exhale
the
fumes
of
the
dull
and
the
inane
from
her
inmost
being
did
you
tell
him
that
inquired
cowperwood
curiously
certainly
i
did
i
do
wonder
he
looks
so
solemn
he
said
turning
and
looking
back
at
greanelle
and
carter
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
in
the
former
beating
the
sand
with
his
toes
you
a
curious
girl
berenice
he
went
on
familiarly
you
are
so
direct
and
vital
at
times
not
any
more
than
you
are
from
all
i
can
hear
she
replied
fixing
him
with
those
steady
eyes
anyhow
why
should
i
be
bored
he
is
so
dull
he
follows
me
around
out
here
all
the
time
and
i
do
want
him
she
tossed
her
head
and
began
to
run
up
the
beach
to
where
bathers
were
fewer
and
fewer
looking
back
at
cowperwood
as
if
to
say
why
you
follow
he
developed
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
and
ran
quite
briskly
overtaking
her
near
some
shallows
where
because
of
a
sandbar
offshore
the
waters
were
thin
and
bright
oh
look
exclaimed
berenice
when
he
came
up
see
the
fish
she
dashed
in
to
where
a
few
feet
offshore
a
small
school
of
minnows
as
large
as
sardines
were
playing
silvery
in
the
sun
she
ran
as
she
had
for
the
bird
doing
her
best
to
frighten
them
into
a
neighboring
pocket
or
pool
farther
up
on
the
shore
cowperwood
as
gay
as
a
boy
of
ten
joined
in
the
chase
he
raced
after
them
briskly
losing
one
school
but
pocketing
another
a
little
farther
on
and
calling
to
her
to
come
oh
exclaimed
berenice
at
one
point
here
they
are
now
come
quick
drive
them
in
here
her
hair
was
blowy
her
face
a
keen
pink
her
eyes
an
electric
blue
by
contrast
she
was
bending
low
over
the
water
cowperwood
also
their
hands
outstretched
the
fish
some
five
in
all
nervously
dancing
before
them
in
their
efforts
to
escape
all
at
once
having
forced
them
into
a
corner
they
dived
berenice
actually
caught
one
cowperwood
missed
by
a
fraction
but
drove
the
fish
she
did
catch
into
her
hands
oh
she
exclaimed
jumping
up
how
wonderful
it
alive
i
caught
it
she
danced
up
and
down
and
cowperwood
standing
before
her
was
sobered
by
her
charm
he
felt
an
impulse
to
speak
to
her
of
his
affection
to
tell
her
how
delicious
she
was
to
him
you
he
said
pausing
over
the
word
and
giving
it
special
emphasis
you
are
the
only
thing
here
that
is
wonderful
to
me
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
the
live
fish
in
her
extended
hands
her
eyes
keying
to
the
situation
for
the
least
fraction
of
a
moment
she
was
uncertain
as
he
could
see
how
to
take
this
many
men
had
been
approximative
before
it
was
common
to
have
compliments
paid
to
her
but
this
was
different
she
said
nothing
but
fixed
him
with
a
look
which
said
quite
plainly
you
had
better
not
say
anything
more
just
now
i
think
then
seeing
that
he
understood
that
his
manner
softened
and
that
he
was
troubled
she
crinkled
her
nose
gaily
and
added
it
like
fairyland
i
feel
as
though
i
had
caught
it
out
of
another
world
cowperwood
understood
the
direct
approach
was
not
for
use
in
her
case
and
yet
there
was
something
a
camaraderie
a
sympathy
which
he
felt
and
which
she
felt
a
girls
school
conventions
the
need
of
socially
placing
herself
her
conservative
friends
and
their
viewpoint
all
were
working
here
if
he
were
only
single
now
she
told
herself
she
would
be
willing
to
listen
to
him
in
a
very
different
spirit
for
he
was
charming
but
this
way
and
he
for
his
part
concluded
that
here
was
one
woman
whom
he
would
gladly
marry
if
she
would
have
him
chapter
xlvii
american
match
following
cowperwood
coup
in
securing
cash
by
means
of
his
seeming
gift
of
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
a
telescope
his
enemies
rested
for
a
time
but
only
because
of
a
lack
of
ideas
wherewith
to
destroy
him
public
sentiment
created
by
the
newspapers
was
still
against
him
yet
his
franchises
had
still
from
eight
to
ten
years
to
run
and
meanwhile
he
might
make
himself
unassailably
powerful
for
the
present
he
was
busy
surrounded
by
his
engineers
and
managers
and
legal
advisers
constructing
his
several
elevated
lines
at
a
whirlwind
rate
at
the
same
time
through
videra
kaffrath
and
addison
he
was
effecting
a
scheme
of
loaning
money
on
call
to
the
local
chicago
banks
the
very
banks
which
were
most
opposed
to
him
so
that
in
a
crisis
he
could
retaliate
by
manipulating
the
vast
quantity
of
stocks
and
bonds
of
which
he
was
now
the
master
he
was
making
money
hand
over
fist
his
one
rule
being
that
six
per
cent
was
enough
to
pay
any
holder
who
had
merely
purchased
his
stock
as
an
outsider
it
was
most
profitable
to
himself
when
his
stocks
earned
more
than
that
he
issued
new
ones
selling
them
on
and
pocketing
the
difference
out
of
the
of
his
various
companies
he
took
immense
sums
temporary
loans
as
it
were
which
later
he
had
charged
by
his
humble
servitors
to
construction
equipment
or
operation
he
was
like
a
canny
wolf
prowling
in
a
forest
of
trees
of
his
own
creation
the
weak
note
in
this
whole
project
of
elevated
lines
was
that
for
some
time
it
was
destined
to
be
unprofitable
its
very
competition
tended
to
weaken
the
value
of
his
companies
his
holdings
in
these
as
well
as
in
shares
were
immense
if
anything
happened
to
cause
them
to
fall
in
price
immense
numbers
of
these
same
stocks
held
by
others
would
be
thrown
on
the
market
thus
still
further
depreciating
their
value
and
compelling
him
to
come
into
the
market
and
buy
with
the
most
painstaking
care
he
began
at
once
to
pile
up
a
reserve
in
government
bonds
for
emergency
purposes
which
he
decided
should
be
not
less
than
eight
or
nine
million
dollars
for
he
feared
financial
storms
as
well
as
financial
reprisal
and
where
so
much
was
at
stake
he
did
not
propose
to
be
caught
napping
at
the
time
that
cowperwood
first
entered
on
construction
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
severe
depression
in
the
american
was
imminent
but
it
was
not
long
before
a
new
difficulty
began
to
appear
it
was
now
the
day
of
the
trust
in
all
its
watery
magnificence
coal
iron
steel
oil
machinery
and
a
score
of
other
commercial
necessities
had
already
been
trustified
and
others
such
as
leather
shoes
cordage
and
the
like
were
almost
hourly
being
brought
under
the
control
of
shrewd
and
ruthless
men
already
in
chicago
schryhart
hand
arneel
merrill
and
a
score
of
others
were
seeing
their
way
to
amazing
profits
by
underwriting
these
ventures
which
required
ready
cash
and
to
which
lesser
magnates
content
with
a
portion
of
the
leavings
of
dives
table
were
glad
to
bring
to
their
attention
on
the
other
hand
in
the
nation
at
large
there
was
growing
up
a
feeling
that
at
the
top
there
were
a
set
of
giants
titans
who
without
heart
or
soul
and
without
any
understanding
of
or
sympathy
with
the
condition
of
the
rank
and
file
were
setting
forth
to
enchain
and
enslave
them
the
vast
mass
writhing
in
ignorance
and
poverty
finally
turned
with
pathetic
fury
to
the
of
a
political
leader
in
the
west
this
latter
prophet
seeing
gold
becoming
scarcer
and
scarcer
and
the
cash
and
credits
of
the
land
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
few
who
were
manipulating
them
for
their
own
benefit
had
decided
that
what
was
needed
was
a
greater
volume
of
currency
so
that
credits
would
be
easier
and
money
cheaper
to
come
by
in
the
matter
of
interest
silver
of
which
there
was
a
superabundance
in
the
mines
was
to
be
coined
at
the
ratio
of
sixteen
dollars
of
silver
for
every
one
of
gold
in
circulation
and
the
parity
of
the
two
metals
maintained
by
fiat
of
government
never
again
should
the
few
be
able
to
make
a
weapon
of
the
people
medium
of
exchange
in
order
to
bring
about
their
undoing
there
was
to
be
ample
money
far
beyond
the
control
of
central
banks
and
the
men
in
power
over
them
it
was
a
splendid
dream
worthy
of
a
charitable
heart
but
because
of
it
a
disturbing
war
for
political
control
of
the
government
was
shortly
threatened
and
soon
began
the
money
element
sensing
the
danger
of
change
involved
in
the
theories
of
the
new
political
leader
began
to
fight
him
and
the
element
in
the
democratic
party
which
he
represented
the
rank
and
file
of
both
parties
the
more
or
less
hungry
and
thirsty
who
lie
ever
at
the
bottom
on
both
sides
hailed
him
as
a
deliverer
a
new
moses
come
to
lead
them
out
of
the
wilderness
of
poverty
and
distress
woe
to
the
political
leader
who
preaches
a
new
doctrine
of
deliverance
and
who
out
of
tenderness
of
heart
offers
a
panacea
for
human
ills
his
truly
shall
be
a
crown
of
thorns
cowperwood
no
less
than
other
men
of
wealth
was
opposed
to
what
he
deemed
a
idea
that
of
maintaining
a
parity
between
gold
and
silver
by
law
confiscation
was
his
word
for
it
the
confiscation
of
the
wealth
of
the
few
for
the
benefit
of
the
many
most
of
all
was
he
opposed
to
it
because
he
feared
that
this
unrest
which
was
obviously
growing
foreshadowed
a
class
war
in
which
investors
would
run
to
cover
and
money
be
locked
in
at
once
he
began
to
shorten
sail
to
invest
only
in
the
soundest
securities
and
to
convert
all
his
weaker
ones
into
cash
to
meet
current
emergencies
however
he
was
compelled
to
borrow
heavily
here
and
there
and
in
doing
so
he
was
quick
to
note
that
those
banks
representing
his
enemies
in
chicago
and
elsewhere
were
willing
to
accept
his
various
stocks
as
collateral
providing
he
would
accept
loans
subject
to
call
he
did
so
gladly
at
the
same
time
suspecting
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
merrill
of
some
scheme
to
wreck
him
providing
they
could
get
him
where
the
calling
of
his
loans
suddenly
and
in
concert
would
financially
embarrass
him
i
think
i
know
what
that
crew
are
up
to
he
once
observed
to
addison
at
this
period
well
they
will
have
to
rise
very
early
in
the
morning
if
they
catch
me
napping
the
thing
that
he
suspected
was
really
true
schryhart
hand
and
arneel
watching
him
through
their
agents
and
brokers
had
soon
discovered
in
the
very
earliest
phases
of
the
silver
agitation
and
before
the
real
storm
broke
that
he
was
borrowing
in
new
york
in
london
in
certain
quarters
of
chicago
and
elsewhere
it
looks
to
me
said
schryhart
one
day
to
his
friend
arneel
as
if
our
friend
has
gotten
in
a
little
too
deep
he
has
overreached
himself
these
schemes
of
his
have
eaten
up
too
much
capital
there
is
another
election
coming
on
next
fall
and
he
knows
we
are
going
to
fight
tooth
and
nail
he
needs
money
to
electrify
his
surface
lines
if
we
could
trace
out
exactly
where
he
stands
and
where
he
has
borrowed
we
might
know
what
to
do
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
replied
arneel
he
is
in
a
tight
place
or
is
rapidly
getting
there
this
silver
agitation
is
beginning
to
weaken
stocks
and
tighten
money
i
suggest
that
our
banks
here
loan
him
all
the
money
he
wants
on
call
when
the
time
comes
if
he
ready
we
can
shut
him
up
tighter
than
a
drum
if
we
can
pick
up
any
other
loans
he
made
anywhere
else
well
and
good
arneel
said
this
without
a
shadow
of
bitterness
or
humor
in
some
tight
hour
perhaps
now
fast
approaching
cowperwood
would
be
promised
salvation
saved
on
condition
that
he
should
leave
chicago
forever
there
were
those
who
would
take
over
his
property
in
the
interest
of
the
city
and
upright
government
and
administer
it
accordingly
unfortunately
at
this
very
time
hand
schryhart
and
arneel
were
themselves
concerned
in
a
little
venture
to
which
the
threatened
silver
agitation
could
bode
nothing
but
ill
this
concerned
so
simple
a
thing
as
matches
a
commodity
which
at
this
time
along
with
many
others
had
been
trustified
and
was
yielding
a
fine
profit
american
match
was
a
stock
which
was
already
listed
on
every
exchange
and
which
was
selling
steadily
around
one
hundred
and
twenty
the
geniuses
who
had
first
planned
a
combination
of
all
match
concerns
and
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
in
america
were
two
men
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
bankers
and
brokers
primarily
phineas
hull
was
a
small
calculating
man
with
a
sparse
growth
of
hair
and
an
eyelid
the
right
one
which
was
partially
paralyzed
and
drooped
heavily
giving
him
a
characterful
and
yet
at
times
a
sinister
expression
his
partner
benoni
stackpole
had
been
once
a
in
arkansas
and
later
a
he
was
a
man
of
great
force
and
calculation
large
oleaginous
politic
and
courageous
without
the
ultimate
brain
capacity
of
such
men
as
arneel
hand
and
merrill
he
was
nevertheless
resourceful
and
able
he
had
started
somewhat
late
in
the
race
for
wealth
but
now
with
all
his
strength
he
was
endeavoring
to
bring
to
fruition
this
plan
which
with
the
aid
of
hull
he
had
formulated
inspired
by
the
thought
of
great
wealth
they
had
first
secured
control
of
the
stock
of
one
match
company
and
had
then
put
themselves
in
a
position
to
bargain
with
the
owners
of
others
the
patents
and
processes
controlled
by
one
company
and
another
had
been
combined
and
the
field
had
been
broadened
as
much
as
possible
but
to
do
all
this
a
great
deal
of
money
had
been
required
much
more
than
was
in
possession
of
either
hull
or
stackpole
both
of
them
being
western
men
they
looked
first
to
western
capital
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
merrill
were
in
turn
appealed
to
and
great
blocks
of
the
new
stock
were
sold
to
them
at
inside
figures
by
the
means
thus
afforded
the
combination
proceeded
apace
patents
for
exclusive
processes
were
taken
over
from
all
sides
and
the
idea
of
invading
europe
and
eventually
controlling
the
market
of
the
world
had
its
inception
at
the
same
time
it
occurred
to
each
and
all
of
their
lordly
patrons
that
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
if
the
stock
they
had
purchased
at
and
which
was
now
selling
in
open
market
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
should
go
to
three
hundred
where
if
these
monopolistic
dreams
were
true
it
properly
belonged
a
little
more
of
this
stock
the
destiny
of
which
at
this
time
seemed
sure
and
splendid
would
not
be
amiss
and
so
there
began
a
quiet
campaign
on
the
part
of
each
capitalist
to
gather
enough
of
it
to
realize
a
true
fortune
on
the
rise
a
game
of
this
kind
is
never
played
with
the
remainder
of
the
financial
community
entirely
unaware
of
what
is
on
foot
in
the
inner
circles
of
brokerage
life
rumors
were
soon
abroad
that
a
tremendous
boom
was
in
store
for
american
match
cowperwood
heard
of
it
through
addison
always
at
the
center
of
financial
rumor
and
the
two
of
them
bought
heavily
though
not
so
heavily
but
that
they
could
clear
out
at
any
time
with
at
least
a
slight
margin
in
their
favor
during
a
period
of
eight
months
the
stock
slowly
moved
upward
finally
crossing
the
mark
and
reaching
at
which
figure
both
addison
and
cowperwood
sold
realizing
nearly
a
million
between
them
on
their
investment
in
the
mean
time
the
foreshadowed
political
storm
was
brewing
at
first
a
cloud
no
larger
than
a
man
hand
it
matured
swiftly
in
the
late
months
of
and
by
the
spring
of
it
had
become
portentous
and
was
ready
to
burst
with
the
climacteric
nomination
of
the
apostle
of
free
silver
for
president
of
the
united
states
which
followed
in
july
a
chill
settled
down
over
the
conservative
and
financial
elements
of
the
country
what
cowperwood
had
wisely
proceeded
to
do
months
before
others
less
from
maine
to
california
and
from
the
gulf
to
canada
began
to
do
now
were
in
part
withdrawn
feeble
or
uncertain
securities
were
thrown
upon
the
market
all
at
once
schryhart
arneel
hand
and
merrill
realized
that
they
were
in
more
or
less
of
a
trap
in
regard
to
their
large
holdings
in
american
match
having
gathered
vast
quantities
of
this
stock
which
had
been
issued
in
blocks
of
millions
it
was
now
necessary
to
sustain
the
market
or
sell
at
a
loss
since
money
was
needed
by
many
holders
and
this
stock
was
selling
at
telegraphic
orders
began
to
pour
in
from
all
parts
of
the
country
to
sell
on
the
chicago
exchange
where
the
deal
was
being
engineered
and
where
the
market
obviously
existed
all
of
the
instigators
of
the
deal
conferred
and
decided
to
sustain
the
market
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
being
the
nominal
heads
of
the
trust
were
delegated
to
buy
they
in
turn
calling
on
the
principal
investors
to
take
their
share
pro
rata
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
merrill
weighted
with
this
inpouring
flood
of
stock
which
they
had
to
take
at
hurried
to
their
favorite
banks
hypothecating
vast
quantities
at
and
over
and
using
the
money
so
obtained
to
take
care
of
the
additional
shares
which
they
were
compelled
to
buy
at
last
however
their
favorite
banks
were
full
to
overflowing
and
at
the
they
could
take
no
more
no
no
no
hand
declared
to
phineas
hull
over
the
i
risk
another
dollar
in
this
venture
and
i
wo
it
a
perfect
proposition
i
realize
all
its
merits
just
as
well
as
you
do
but
enough
is
enough
i
tell
you
a
financial
slump
is
coming
that
the
reason
all
this
stock
is
coming
out
now
i
am
willing
to
protect
my
interests
in
this
thing
up
to
a
certain
point
as
i
told
you
i
agree
not
to
throw
a
single
share
on
the
market
of
all
that
i
now
have
but
more
than
that
i
can
not
do
the
other
gentlemen
in
this
agreement
will
have
to
protect
themselves
as
best
they
can
i
have
other
things
to
look
out
for
that
are
just
as
important
to
me
and
more
so
than
american
match
it
was
the
same
with
schryhart
who
stroking
a
crisp
black
mustache
was
wondering
whether
he
had
not
better
throw
over
what
holdings
he
had
and
clear
out
however
he
feared
the
rage
of
hand
and
arneel
for
breaking
the
market
and
thus
bringing
on
a
local
panic
it
was
risky
business
arneel
and
merrill
finally
agreed
to
hold
firm
to
what
they
had
but
as
they
told
mr
hull
nothing
could
induce
them
to
protect
another
share
come
what
might
in
this
crisis
naturally
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
estimable
gentlemen
both
were
greatly
depressed
by
no
means
so
wealthy
as
their
lofty
patrons
their
private
fortunes
were
in
much
greater
jeopardy
they
were
eager
to
make
any
port
in
so
black
a
storm
witness
then
the
arrival
of
benoni
stackpole
at
the
office
of
frank
algernon
cowperwood
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
and
cowperwood
was
the
only
really
rich
man
in
the
city
not
yet
involved
in
this
speculation
in
the
beginning
he
had
heard
both
hand
and
schryhart
say
that
they
did
not
care
to
become
involved
if
cowperwood
was
in
any
way
shape
or
manner
to
be
included
but
that
had
been
over
a
year
ago
and
schryhart
and
hand
were
now
as
it
were
leaving
both
him
and
his
partner
to
their
fates
they
could
have
no
objection
to
his
dealing
with
cowperwood
in
this
crisis
if
he
could
make
sure
that
the
magnate
would
not
sell
him
out
stackpole
was
six
feet
one
in
his
socks
and
weighed
two
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
clad
in
a
brown
linen
suit
and
straw
hat
for
it
was
late
july
he
carried
a
fan
as
well
as
his
troublesome
stocks
in
a
small
yellow
leather
bag
he
was
wet
with
perspiration
and
in
a
gloomy
state
of
mind
failure
was
staring
him
in
the
face
giant
failure
if
american
match
fell
below
two
hundred
he
would
have
to
close
his
doors
as
banker
and
broker
and
in
view
of
what
he
was
carrying
he
and
hull
would
fail
for
approximately
twenty
million
dollars
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
merrill
would
lose
in
the
neighborhood
of
six
or
eight
millions
between
them
the
local
banks
would
suffer
in
proportion
though
not
nearly
so
severely
for
loaning
at
they
would
only
sacrifice
the
difference
between
that
and
the
lowest
point
to
which
the
stock
might
fall
cowperwood
eyed
the
when
he
entered
with
an
equivocal
eye
for
he
knew
well
now
what
was
coming
only
a
few
days
before
he
had
predicted
an
eventual
smash
to
addison
cowperwood
began
stackpole
in
this
bag
i
have
fifteen
thousand

five
hundred

three
hundred

worth

three

and
more
i
do
know
how
closely
you
have
been
following
the
developments
of
american
match
we
own
all
the
patents
on
machines
and
what
more
we
just
about
to
close
contracts
with
italy
and
france
to
lease
our
machines
and
processes
to
them
for
pretty
nearly
one
million
dollars
a
year
each
we
dickering
with
austria
and
england
and
of
course
we
take
up
other
countries
later
the
american
match
company
will
yet
make
matches
for
the
whole
world
whether
connected
with
it
or
not
this
silver
agitation
has
caught
us
right
in
and
we
having
a
little
trouble
weathering
the
storm
a
perfectly
frank
man
when
it
comes
to
close
business
relations
of
this
kind
and
i
going
to
tell
you
just
how
things
stand
if
we
can
scull
over
this
rough
place
that
has
come
up
on
account
of
the
silver
agitation
our
stock
will
go
to
three
hundred
before
the
first
of
the
year
now
if
you
want
to
take
it
you
can
have
it
outright
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
that
is
providing
you
agree
not
to
throw
any
of
it
back
on
the
market
before
next
december
or
if
you
promise
that
he
paused
to
see
if
by
any
chance
he
could
read
cowperwood
inscrutable
face
i
want
you
to
loan
me
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
share
on
these
for
thirty
days
at
least
at
ten
or
fifteen
or
whatever
rate
you
care
to
fix
cowperwood
interlocked
his
fingers
and
twiddled
his
thumbs
as
he
contemplated
this
latest
evidence
of
earthly
difficulty
and
uncertainty
time
and
chance
certainly
happened
to
all
men
and
here
was
one
opportunity
of
paying
out
those
who
had
been
nagging
him
to
take
this
stock
at
on
loan
and
peddle
it
out
swiftly
and
fully
at
or
less
would
bring
american
match
crumbling
about
their
ears
when
it
was
selling
at
or
less
he
could
buy
it
back
pocket
his
profit
complete
his
deal
with
stackpole
pocket
his
interest
and
smile
like
the
cat
in
the
fable
it
was
as
simple
as
twiddling
his
thumbs
which
he
was
now
doing
who
has
been
backing
this
stock
here
in
chicago
besides
yourself
and
mr
hull
he
asked
pleasantly
i
think
that
i
already
know
but
i
should
like
to
be
certain
if
you
have
no
objection
none
in
the
least
none
in
the
least
replied
stackpole
accommodatingly
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
mr
merrill
that
is
what
i
thought
commented
cowperwood
easily
they
take
this
up
for
you
is
that
it
saturated
saturated
agreed
stackpole
dully
but
there
one
thing
have
to
stipulate
in
accepting
a
loan
on
these
not
a
share
must
be
thrown
on
the
market
or
at
least
not
before
i
have
failed
to
respond
to
your
call
i
have
understood
that
there
is
a
little
feeling
between
you
and
hand
and
the
other
gentlemen
i
have
mentioned
but
as
i
say
and
i
talking
perfectly
frankly
now
i
in
a
corner
and
any
port
in
a
storm
if
you
want
to
help
me
i
make
the
best
terms
i
can
and
i
wo
forget
the
favor
he
opened
the
bag
and
began
to
take
out
the
securities
long
bundles
tightly
gripped
in
the
center
by
thick
elastic
bands
they
were
in
bundles
of
one
thousand
shares
each
since
stackpole
half
proffered
them
to
him
cowperwood
took
them
in
one
hand
and
lightly
weighed
them
up
and
down
i
sorry
stackpole
he
said
sympathetically
after
a
moment
of
apparent
reflection
but
i
can
not
possibly
help
you
in
this
matter
i
too
involved
in
other
things
myself
and
i
do
not
often
indulge
in
of
any
kind
i
have
no
particular
malice
toward
any
one
of
the
gentlemen
you
mention
i
do
not
trouble
to
dislike
all
who
dislike
me
i
might
of
course
if
i
chose
take
these
stocks
and
pay
them
out
and
throw
them
on
the
market
but
i
have
no
desire
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
only
wish
i
could
help
you
and
if
i
thought
i
could
carry
them
safely
for
three
or
four
months
i
would
as
it
is
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
sympathetically
have
you
tried
all
the
bankers
in
town
practically
every
one
and
they
ca
help
you
they
are
carrying
all
they
can
stand
now
too
bad
i
sorry
very
by
the
way
do
you
happen
by
any
chance
to
know
millard
bailey
or
edwin
kaffrath
no
i
do
replied
stackpole
hopefully
well
now
there
are
two
men
who
are
much
richer
than
is
generally
supposed
they
often
have
very
large
sums
at
their
disposal
you
might
look
them
up
on
a
chance
then
there
my
friend
videra
i
know
how
he
is
fixed
at
present
you
can
always
find
him
at
the
twelfth
ward
bank
he
might
be
inclined
to
take
a
good
portion
of
that
i
do
know
he
much
better
off
than
most
people
seem
to
think
i
wonder
you
have
been
directed
to
some
one
of
these
men
before
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
of
the
individuals
in
question
would
have
been
interested
to
take
a
dollar
of
this
loan
except
on
cowperwood
order
but
stackpole
had
no
reason
for
knowing
this
they
were
not
prominently
identified
with
the
magnate
thank
you
very
much
i
will
observed
stackpole
restoring
his
undesired
stocks
to
his
bag
cowperwood
with
an
admirable
show
of
courtesy
called
a
stenographer
and
pretended
to
secure
for
his
guest
the
home
addresses
of
these
gentlemen
he
then
bade
stackpole
an
encouraging
farewell
the
distrait
promoter
at
once
decided
to
try
not
only
bailey
and
kaffrath
but
videra
but
even
as
he
drove
toward
the
office
of
the
cowperwood
was
personally
busy
reaching
him
by
telephone
i
say
bailey
he
called
when
he
had
secured
the
wealthy
lumberman
on
the
wire
benoni
stackpole
of
hull
stackpole
was
here
to
see
me
just
now
yes
he
has
with
him
fifteen
thousand
shares
of
american
match
par
value
one
hundred
market
value
yes
he
is
trying
to
hypothecate
the
lot
or
any
part
of
it
at
yes
you
know
what
the
trouble
with
american
match
is
do
you
no
i
only
know
it
being
driven
up
to
where
it
is
now
by
a
bull
campaign
well
listen
to
me
it
going
to
break
american
match
is
going
to
bust
yes
but
i
want
you
to
loan
this
man
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
or
less
and
then
recommend
that
he
go
to
edwin
kaffrath
or
anton
videra
for
the
balance
but
frank
i
have
any
five
hundred
thousand
to
spare
you
say
american
match
is
going
to
bust
i
know
you
have
but
draw
the
check
on
the
chicago
trust
and
addison
will
honor
it
send
the
stock
to
me
and
forget
all
about
it
i
will
do
the
rest
but
under
no
circumstances
mention
my
name
and
do
appear
too
eager
not
more
than
at
the
outside
do
you
hear
and
less
if
you
can
get
it
you
recognize
my
voice
do
you
perfectly
drive
over
afterward
if
you
have
time
and
let
me
know
what
happens
very
good
commented
bailey
in
a
businesslike
way
cowperwood
next
called
for
kaffrath
conversing
to
similar
effect
with
that
individual
and
with
videra
before
of
an
hour
cowperwood
had
arranged
completely
for
stackpole
tour
he
was
to
have
his
total
loan
at
or
less
checks
were
to
be
forthcoming
at
once
different
banks
were
to
be
drawn
on
banks
other
than
the
chicago
trust
company
cowperwood
would
see
in
some
roundabout
way
that
these
checks
were
promptly
honored
whether
the
cash
was
there
or
not
in
each
case
the
hypothecated
stocks
were
to
be
sent
to
him
then
having
seen
to
the
perfecting
of
this
little
programme
and
that
the
banks
to
be
drawn
upon
in
this
connection
understood
perfectly
that
the
checks
in
question
were
guaranteed
by
him
or
others
he
sat
down
to
await
the
arrival
of
his
henchmen
and
the
turning
of
the
stock
into
his
private
safe
chapter
xlviii
panic
on
august
the
city
of
chicago
and
for
that
matter
the
entire
financial
world
was
startled
and
amazed
by
the
collapse
of
american
match
one
of
the
strongest
of
market
securities
and
the
coincident
failure
of
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
its
ostensible
promoters
for
twenty
millions
as
early
as
eleven
of
the
preceding
day
the
banking
and
brokerage
world
of
chicago
trading
in
this
stock
was
fully
aware
that
something
untoward
was
on
foot
in
connection
with
it
owing
to
the
high
price
at
which
the
stock
was
protected
and
the
need
of
money
to
liquidate
blocks
of
this
stock
from
all
parts
of
the
country
were
being
rushed
to
the
market
with
the
hope
of
realizing
before
the
ultimate
break
about
the
which
frowned
like
a
gray
fortress
at
the
foot
of
la
salle
street
all
was
excitement
as
though
a
giant
anthill
had
been
ruthlessly
disturbed
clerks
and
messengers
hurried
to
and
fro
in
confused
and
apparently
aimless
directions
brokers
whose
supply
of
american
match
had
been
apparently
exhausted
on
the
previous
day
now
appeared
on
bright
and
early
and
at
the
clang
of
the
gong
began
to
offer
the
stock
in
sizable
lots
of
from
two
hundred
to
five
hundred
shares
the
agents
of
hull
stackpole
were
in
the
market
of
course
in
the
front
rank
of
the
scrambling
yelling
throng
taking
up
whatever
stock
appeared
at
the
price
they
were
hoping
to
maintain
the
two
promoters
were
in
touch
by
and
wire
not
only
with
those
various
important
personages
whom
they
had
induced
to
enter
upon
this
bull
campaign
but
with
their
various
clerks
and
agents
on
naturally
under
the
circumstances
both
were
in
a
gloomy
frame
of
mind
this
game
was
no
longer
moving
in
those
large
easy
sweeps
which
characterize
the
more
favorable
aspects
of
high
finance
sad
to
relate
as
in
all
the
troubled
flumes
of
life
where
vast
currents
are
compressed
in
narrow
tortuous
spaces
these
two
men
were
now
concerned
chiefly
with
the
momentary
care
of
small
but
none
the
less
heartbreaking
burdens
where
to
find
fifty
thousand
to
take
care
of
this
or
that
burden
of
stock
which
was
momentarily
falling
upon
them
they
were
as
two
men
called
upon
with
their
limited
hands
and
strength
to
seal
up
the
crevices
of
a
dike
beyond
which
raged
a
mountainous
and
destructive
sea
at
eleven
phineas
hull
rose
from
the
chair
which
sat
before
his
solid
mahogany
desk
and
confronted
his
partner
i
tell
you
ben
he
said
i
afraid
we
ca
make
this
hypothecated
so
much
of
this
stock
around
town
that
we
ca
possibly
tell
who
doing
what
i
know
as
well
as
i
standing
on
this
floor
that
some
one
i
ca
say
which
one
is
selling
us
out
you
suppose
it
could
be
cowperwood
or
any
of
those
people
he
sent
to
us
do
you
stackpole
worn
by
his
experiences
of
the
past
few
weeks
was
inclined
to
be
irritable
how
should
i
know
phineas
he
inquired
scowling
in
troubled
thought
i
do
think
so
i
did
notice
any
signs
that
they
were
interested
in
anyhow
we
had
to
have
the
money
in
some
form
any
one
of
the
whole
crowd
is
apt
to
get
frightened
now
at
any
moment
and
throw
the
whole
thing
over
we
in
a
tight
place
plain
for
the
fortieth
time
he
plucked
at
a
collar
and
pulled
up
his
for
it
was
stifling
and
he
was
coatless
and
waistcoatless
just
then
mr
hull
telephone
bell
rang
the
one
connecting
with
the
firm
private
office
on
and
the
latter
jumped
to
seize
the
receiver
yes
he
inquired
irritably
two
thousand
shares
of
american
offered
at
shall
i
take
them
the
man
who
was
was
in
sight
of
another
man
who
stood
at
the
railing
of
the
brokers
gallery
overlooking
the
pit
or
central
room
of
the
and
who
instantly
transferred
any
sign
he
might
receive
to
the
man
on
the
floor
so
mr
hull
yea
or
nay
would
be
almost
instantly
transmuted
into
a
cash
transaction
on
what
do
you
think
of
that
asked
hull
of
stackpole
putting
his
hand
over
the
receiver
mouth
his
right
eyelid
drooping
heavier
than
ever
two
thousand
more
to
take
up
where
suppose
they
are
coming
from
tch
well
the
bottom
out
that
all
replied
stackpole
heavily
and
gutturally
we
ca
do
what
we
ca
do
i
say
this
though
support
it
at
until
three
then
we
figure
up
where
we
stand
and
what
we
owe
and
meanwhile
i
see
what
i
can
do
if
the
banks
wo
help
us
and
arneel
and
that
crowd
want
to
get
from
under
we
fail
that
all
but
not
before
i
had
one
more
try
by
jericho
they
may
not
help
us
but
actually
stackpole
did
not
see
what
was
to
be
done
unless
hand
schryhart
merrill
and
arneel
were
willing
to
risk
much
more
money
but
it
grieved
and
angered
him
to
think
he
and
hull
should
be
thus
left
to
sink
without
a
sigh
he
had
tried
kaffrath
videra
and
bailey
but
they
were
adamant
thus
cogitating
stackpole
put
on
his
straw
hat
and
went
out
it
was
nearly
in
the
shade
the
granite
and
asphalt
pavements
of
the
district
reflected
a
dry
heat
there
was
no
air
to
speak
of
the
sky
was
a
burning
milky
blue
with
the
sun
gleaming
feverishly
upon
the
upper
walls
of
the
tall
buildings
hand
in
his
suite
of
offices
in
the
rookery
building
was
suffering
from
the
heat
but
much
more
from
mental
perturbation
though
not
a
stingy
or
penurious
man
it
was
still
true
that
of
all
earthly
things
he
suffered
most
from
a
financial
loss
how
often
had
he
seen
chance
or
miscalculation
sweep
apparently
strong
and
valiant
men
into
the
limbo
of
the
useless
and
forgotten
since
the
alienation
of
his
wife
affections
by
cowperwood
he
had
scarcely
any
interest
in
the
world
outside
his
large
financial
holdings
which
included
profitable
investments
in
a
companies
but
they
must
pay
pay
pay
heavily
in
interest
all
of
them
and
the
thought
that
one
of
them
might
become
a
failure
or
a
drain
on
his
resources
was
enough
to
give
him
an
almost
physical
sensation
of
dissatisfaction
and
unrest
a
sort
of
spiritual
and
mental
nausea
which
would
cling
to
him
for
days
and
days
or
until
he
had
surmounted
the
difficulty
hand
had
no
least
corner
in
his
heart
for
failure
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
situation
in
regard
to
american
match
had
reached
such
proportions
as
to
be
almost
numbing
aside
from
the
fifteen
thousand
shares
which
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
had
originally
set
aside
for
themselves
hand
arneel
schryhart
and
merrill
had
purchased
five
thousand
shares
each
at
forty
but
had
since
been
compelled
to
sustain
the
market
to
the
extent
of
over
five
thousand
shares
more
each
at
prices
ranging
from
to
the
largest
blocks
of
shares
having
been
bought
at
the
latter
figure
actually
hand
was
caught
for
nearly
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
his
soul
was
as
gray
as
a
bat
wing
at
years
of
age
men
who
are
used
only
to
the
most
successful
financial
calculations
and
the
credit
that
goes
with
unerring
judgment
dread
to
be
made
a
mark
by
chance
or
fate
it
opens
the
way
for
comment
on
their
possibly
failing
vitality
or
judgment
and
so
hand
sat
on
this
hot
august
afternoon
ensconced
in
a
large
carved
mahogany
chair
in
the
inner
recesses
of
his
inner
offices
and
brooded
only
this
morning
in
the
face
of
a
falling
market
he
would
have
sold
out
openly
had
he
not
been
deterred
by
telephone
messages
from
arneel
and
schryhart
suggesting
the
advisability
of
a
pool
conference
before
any
action
was
taken
come
what
might
on
the
morrow
he
was
determined
to
quit
unless
he
saw
some
clear
way
out
to
be
shut
of
the
whole
thing
unless
the
ingenuity
of
stackpole
and
hull
should
discover
a
way
of
sustaining
the
market
without
his
aid
while
he
was
meditating
on
how
this
was
to
be
done
stackpole
appeared
pale
gloomy
wet
with
perspiration
well
hand
he
exclaimed
wearily
i
done
all
i
can
hull
and
i
have
kept
the
market
fairly
stable
so
far
you
saw
what
happened
between
ten
and
eleven
this
morning
the
jig
up
we
borrowed
our
last
dollar
and
hypothecated
our
last
share
my
personal
fortune
has
gone
into
the
balance
and
so
has
hull
some
one
of
the
outside
stockholders
or
all
of
them
are
cutting
the
ground
from
under
us
fourteen
thousand
shares
since
ten
this
morning
that
tells
the
story
it
ca
be
done
just
now
not
unless
you
gentlemen
are
prepared
to
go
much
further
than
you
have
yet
gone
if
we
could
organize
a
pool
to
take
care
of
fifteen
thousand
more
shares
stackpole
paused
for
hand
was
holding
up
a
fat
pink
digit
no
more
of
that
he
was
saying
solemnly
it
ca
be
done
i
for
one
wo
sink
another
dollar
in
this
proposition
at
this
time
rather
throw
what
i
have
on
the
market
and
take
what
i
can
get
i
am
sure
the
others
feel
the
same
way
hand
to
play
safe
had
hypothecated
nearly
all
his
shares
with
various
banks
in
order
to
release
his
money
for
other
purposes
and
he
knew
he
would
not
dare
to
throw
over
all
his
holdings
just
as
he
knew
he
would
have
to
make
good
at
the
figure
at
which
they
had
been
margined
but
it
was
a
fine
threat
to
make
stackpole
stared
at
hand
very
well
he
said
i
might
as
well
go
back
then
and
post
a
notice
on
our
front
door
we
bought
fourteen
thousand
shares
and
held
the
market
where
it
is
but
we
have
a
dollar
to
pay
for
them
with
unless
the
banks
or
some
one
will
take
them
over
for
us
gone
we
bankrupt
hand
who
knew
that
if
stackpole
carried
out
this
decision
it
meant
the
loss
of
his
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
halted
mentally
have
you
been
to
all
the
banks
he
asked
what
does
lawrence
of
the
prairie
national
have
to
say
it
the
same
with
all
of
them
replied
stackpole
now
quite
desperate
as
it
is
with
you
they
have
all
they
can
carry
every
one
it
this
damned
silver
agitation
that
it
and
nothing
else
there
nothing
the
matter
with
this
stock
it
will
right
itself
in
a
few
months
it
sure
to
will
it
commented
hand
sourly
that
depends
on
what
happens
next
november
he
was
referring
to
the
coming
national
election
yes
i
know
sighed
stackpole
seeing
that
it
was
a
condition
and
not
a
theory
that
confronted
him
then
suddenly
clenching
his
right
hand
he
exclaimed
damn
that
upstart
he
was
thinking
of
the
apostle
of
free
silver
he
the
cause
of
all
this
well
if
there
nothing
to
be
done
i
might
as
well
be
going
there
all
those
shares
we
bought
which
we
ought
to
be
able
to
hypothecate
with
somebody
it
would
be
something
if
we
could
get
even
a
hundred
and
twenty
on
them
very
true
replied
hand
i
wish
it
could
be
done
i
personally
can
not
sink
any
more
money
but
why
do
you
go
and
see
schryhart
and
arneel
i
been
talking
to
them
and
they
seem
to
be
in
a
position
similar
to
my
own
but
if
they
are
willing
to
confer
i
am
i
see
what
to
be
done
but
it
may
be
that
all
of
us
together
might
arrange
some
way
of
heading
off
the
slaughter
of
the
stock
i
do
know
if
only
we
do
have
to
suffer
too
great
a
decline
hand
was
thinking
that
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
might
be
forced
to
part
with
all
their
remaining
holdings
at
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
or
less
then
if
it
could
possibly
be
taken
and
carried
by
the
united
banks
for
them
schryhart
himself
arneel
and
sold
at
a
profit
later
he
and
his
associates
might
recoup
some
of
their
losses
the
local
banks
at
the
behest
of
the
big
quadrumvirate
might
be
coerced
into
straining
their
resources
still
further
but
how
was
this
to
be
done
how
indeed
it
was
schryhart
who
in
pumping
and
digging
at
stackpole
when
he
finally
arrived
there
managed
to
extract
from
him
the
truth
in
regard
to
his
visit
to
cowperwood
as
a
matter
of
fact
schryhart
himself
had
been
guilty
this
very
day
of
having
thrown
two
thousand
shares
of
american
match
on
the
market
unknown
to
his
confreres
naturally
he
was
eager
to
learn
whether
stackpole
or
any
one
else
had
the
least
suspicion
that
he
was
involved
as
a
consequence
he
questioned
stackpole
closely
and
the
latter
being
anxious
as
to
the
outcome
of
his
own
interests
was
not
unwilling
to
make
a
clean
breast
he
had
the
justification
in
his
own
mind
that
the
quadrumvirate
had
been
ready
to
desert
him
anyhow
why
did
you
go
to
him
exclaimed
schryhart
professing
to
be
greatly
astonished
and
annoyed
as
indeed
in
one
sense
he
was
i
thought
we
had
a
distinct
understanding
in
the
beginning
that
under
no
circumstances
was
he
to
be
included
in
any
portion
of
this
you
might
as
well
go
to
the
devil
himself
for
assistance
as
go
there
at
the
same
time
he
was
thinking
how
fortunate
here
was
not
only
a
loophole
for
himself
in
connection
with
his
own
subtle
but
also
if
the
quadrumvirate
desired
an
excuse
for
deserting
the
troublesome
fortunes
of
hull
stackpole
well
the
truth
is
replied
stackpole
somewhat
sheepishly
and
yet
defiantly
last
thursday
i
had
fifteen
thousand
shares
on
which
i
had
to
raise
money
neither
you
nor
any
of
the
others
wanted
any
more
the
banks
would
take
them
i
called
up
rambaud
on
a
chance
and
he
suggested
cowperwood
as
has
been
related
stackpole
had
really
gone
to
cowperwood
direct
but
a
lie
under
the
circumstances
seemed
rather
essential
rambaud
sneered
schryhart
cowperwood
man
he
and
all
the
others
you
could
have
gone
to
a
worse
crowd
if
you
had
tried
so
that
where
this
stock
is
coming
from
beyond
a
doubt
that
fellow
or
his
friends
are
selling
us
out
you
might
have
known
he
do
it
he
hates
us
so
you
through
are
you
not
another
single
trick
to
turn
not
one
replied
stackpole
solemnly
well
that
too
bad
you
have
acted
most
unwisely
in
going
to
cowperwood
but
we
shall
have
to
see
what
can
be
done
schryhart
idea
like
that
of
hand
was
to
cause
hull
stackpole
to
relinquish
all
their
holdings
for
nothing
to
the
banks
in
order
that
under
pressure
the
latter
might
carry
the
stocks
he
and
the
others
had
hypothecated
with
them
until
such
a
time
as
the
company
might
be
organized
at
a
profit
at
the
same
time
he
was
intensely
resentful
against
cowperwood
for
having
by
any
fluke
of
circumstance
reaped
so
large
a
profit
as
he
must
have
done
plainly
the
present
crisis
had
something
to
do
with
him
schryhart
was
quick
to
call
up
hand
and
arneel
after
stackpole
had
gone
suggesting
a
conference
and
together
an
hour
later
at
arneel
office
they
foregathered
along
with
merrill
to
discuss
this
new
and
very
interesting
development
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon
all
of
these
gentlemen
had
been
growing
more
and
more
uneasy
not
that
between
them
they
were
not
eminently
capable
of
taking
care
of
their
own
losses
but
the
sympathetic
effect
of
such
a
failure
as
this
twenty
million
dollars
to
say
nothing
of
its
reaction
upon
the
honor
of
themselves
and
the
city
as
a
financial
center
was
a
most
unsatisfactory
if
not
disastrous
thing
to
contemplate
and
now
this
matter
of
having
gained
handsomely
by
it
all
was
added
to
their
misery
both
hand
and
arneel
growled
in
opposition
when
they
heard
and
merrill
meditated
as
he
usually
did
on
the
wonder
of
cowperwood
subtlety
he
could
not
help
liking
him
there
is
a
sort
of
municipal
pride
latent
in
the
bosoms
of
most
members
of
a
really
thriving
community
which
often
comes
to
the
surface
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
these
four
men
were
by
no
means
an
exception
to
this
rule
schryhart
hand
arneel
and
merrill
were
concerned
as
to
the
good
name
of
chicago
and
their
united
standing
in
the
eyes
of
eastern
financiers
it
was
a
sad
blow
to
them
to
think
that
the
one
great
enterprise
they
had
recently
engineered
a
foil
to
some
of
the
immense
affairs
which
had
recently
had
their
genesis
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
should
have
come
to
so
untimely
an
end
chicago
finance
really
should
not
be
put
to
shame
in
this
fashion
if
it
could
be
avoided
so
that
when
schryhart
arrived
quite
warm
and
disturbed
and
related
in
detail
what
he
had
just
learned
his
friends
listened
to
him
with
eager
and
wary
ears
it
was
now
between
five
and
six
in
the
afternoon
and
still
blazing
outside
though
the
walls
of
the
buildings
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
were
a
cool
gray
picked
out
with
pools
of
black
shadow
a
newsboy
strident
voice
was
heard
here
and
there
calling
an
extra
mingled
with
the
sound
of
homing
feet
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
schryhart
finally
it
seems
to
me
we
have
stood
just
about
enough
of
this
man
beggarly
interference
i
admit
that
neither
hull
nor
stackpole
had
any
right
to
go
to
him
they
laid
themselves
and
us
open
to
just
such
a
trick
as
has
been
worked
in
this
case
schryhart
was
righteously
incisive
cold
immaculate
waspish
at
the
same
time
he
continued
any
other
moneyed
man
of
equal
standing
with
ourselves
would
have
had
the
courtesy
to
confer
with
us
and
give
us
or
at
least
our
banks
an
opportunity
for
taking
over
these
securities
he
would
have
come
to
our
aid
for
chicago
sake
he
had
no
occasion
for
throwing
these
stocks
on
the
market
considering
the
state
of
things
he
knows
very
well
what
the
effect
of
their
failure
will
be
the
whole
city
is
involved
but
it
little
he
cares
stackpole
tells
me
that
he
had
an
express
understanding
with
him
or
rather
with
the
men
who
it
is
plain
have
been
representing
him
that
not
a
single
share
of
this
stock
was
to
be
thrown
on
the
market
as
it
is
i
venture
to
say
not
a
single
share
of
it
is
to
be
found
anywhere
in
any
of
their
safes
i
can
sympathize
to
a
certain
extent
with
poor
stackpole
his
position
of
course
was
very
trying
but
there
is
no
excuse
none
in
the
world
for
such
a
stroke
of
trickery
on
cowperwood
part
it
just
as
we
known
all
along
the
man
is
nothing
but
a
wrecker
we
certainly
ought
to
find
some
method
of
ending
his
career
here
if
possible
schryhart
kicked
out
his
legs
adjusted
his
collar
and
smoothed
his
short
crisp
wiry
now
mustache
his
black
eyes
flashed
an
undying
hate
at
this
point
arneel
with
a
cogency
of
reasoning
which
did
not
at
the
moment
appear
on
the
surface
inquired
do
any
of
you
happen
to
know
anything
in
particular
about
the
state
of
finances
at
present
of
course
we
know
of
the
lake
street
and
the
northwestern
i
hear
he
building
a
house
in
new
york
and
i
presume
that
drawing
on
him
somewhat
i
know
he
has
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
loans
from
the
chicago
central
but
what
else
has
he
well
there
the
two
hundred
thousand
he
owes
the
prairie
national
piped
up
schrybart
promptly
from
time
to
time
i
heard
of
several
other
sums
that
escape
my
mind
just
now
merrill
a
diplomatic
mouse
of
a
man
gray
parisian
dandified
was
twisting
in
his
large
chair
surveying
the
others
with
shrewd
though
somewhat
propitiatory
eyes
in
spite
of
his
old
grudge
against
cowperwood
because
of
the
latter
refusal
to
favor
him
in
the
matter
of
running
lines
past
his
store
he
had
always
been
interested
in
the
man
as
a
spectacle
he
really
disliked
the
thought
of
plotting
to
injure
cowperwood
just
the
same
he
felt
it
incumbent
to
play
his
part
in
such
a
council
as
this
my
financial
agent
hill
loaned
him
several
hundred
thousand
not
long
ago
he
volunteered
a
little
doubtfully
i
presume
he
has
many
other
outstanding
obligations
hand
stirred
irritably
well
he
owing
the
third
national
and
the
lake
city
as
much
if
not
more
he
commented
i
know
where
there
are
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
his
loans
that
have
been
mentioned
here
colonel
ballinger
has
two
hundred
thousand
he
must
owe
anthony
ewer
all
of
that
he
owes
the
drovers
and
traders
all
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
on
the
basis
of
these
suggestions
arneel
made
a
mental
calculation
and
found
that
cowperwood
was
indebted
apparently
to
the
tune
of
about
three
million
dollars
on
call
if
not
more
i
have
all
the
facts
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
distinctly
if
we
could
talk
with
some
of
the
presidents
of
our
banks
we
should
probably
find
that
there
are
other
items
of
which
we
do
not
know
i
do
not
like
to
be
severe
on
any
one
but
our
own
situation
is
serious
unless
something
is
done
hull
stackpole
will
certainly
fail
in
the
morning
we
are
of
course
obligated
to
the
various
banks
for
our
loans
and
we
are
in
honor
bound
to
do
all
we
can
for
them
the
good
name
of
chicago
and
its
rank
as
a
banking
center
is
to
a
certain
extent
involved
as
i
have
already
told
stackpole
and
mr
hull
i
personally
have
gone
as
far
as
i
can
in
this
matter
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
with
each
of
you
the
only
other
resources
we
have
under
the
circumstances
are
the
banks
and
they
as
i
understand
it
are
pretty
much
involved
with
stock
on
hypothecation
i
know
at
least
that
this
is
true
of
the
lake
city
and
the
douglas
trust
it
true
of
nearly
all
of
them
said
hand
both
schryhart
and
merrill
nodded
assent
we
are
not
obligated
to
cowperwood
for
anything
so
far
as
i
know
continued
arneel
after
a
slight
but
somewhat
portentous
pause
as
schryhart
has
suggested
here
he
seems
to
have
a
tendency
to
interfere
and
disturb
on
every
occasion
apparently
he
stands
obligated
to
the
various
banks
in
the
sums
we
have
mentioned
why
should
his
loans
be
called
it
would
help
strengthen
the
local
banks
and
possibly
permit
them
to
aid
in
meeting
this
situation
for
us
while
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
retaliate
i
doubt
it
arneel
had
no
personal
opposition
to
cowperwood
none
at
least
of
a
character
at
the
same
time
hand
merrill
and
schryhart
were
his
friends
in
him
they
felt
centered
the
financial
leadership
of
the
city
the
rise
of
cowperwood
his
napoleonic
airs
threatened
this
as
arneel
talked
he
never
raised
his
eyes
from
the
desk
where
he
was
sitting
he
merely
drummed
solemnly
on
the
surface
with
his
fingers
the
others
contemplated
him
a
little
tensely
catching
quite
clearly
the
drift
of
his
proposal
an
excellent
idea
excellent
exclaimed
schryhart
i
will
join
in
any
programme
that
looks
to
the
elimination
of
this
man
the
present
situation
may
be
just
what
is
needed
to
accomplish
this
anyhow
it
may
help
to
solve
our
difficulty
if
so
it
will
certainly
be
a
case
of
good
coming
out
of
evil
i
see
no
reason
why
these
loans
should
not
be
called
hand
commented
i
willing
to
meet
the
situation
on
that
basis
and
i
have
no
particular
objection
said
merrill
i
think
however
it
would
be
only
fair
to
give
as
much
notice
as
possible
of
any
decision
we
may
reach
he
added
why
not
send
for
the
various
bankers
now
suggested
schryhart
and
find
out
exactly
where
he
stands
and
how
much
it
will
take
to
carry
hull
stackpole
then
we
can
inform
cowperwood
of
what
we
propose
to
do
to
this
proposition
hand
nodded
an
assent
at
the
same
time
consulting
a
large
heavily
engraved
gold
watch
of
the
most
ponderous
and
inartistic
design
i
think
he
said
that
we
have
found
the
solution
to
this
situation
at
last
i
suggest
that
we
get
candish
and
kramer
of
the
he
was
referring
to
the
president
and
secretary
respectively
of
that
organization
and
simmons
of
the
douglas
trust
we
should
soon
be
able
to
tell
what
we
can
do
the
library
of
arneel
home
was
fixed
upon
as
the
most
suitable
rendezvous
telephones
were
forthwith
set
ringing
and
messengers
and
telegrams
despatched
in
order
that
the
subsidiary
financial
luminaries
and
the
of
the
various
local
treasuries
might
come
and
as
it
were
put
their
seal
on
this
secret
decision
which
it
was
obviously
presumed
no
minor
official
or
luminary
would
have
the
temerity
to
gainsay
chapter
xlix
mount
olympus
by
eight
at
which
hour
the
conference
was
set
the
principal
financial
personages
of
chicago
were
truly
in
a
great
turmoil
hand
schryhart
merrill
and
arneel
were
personally
interested
what
would
you
as
early
as
there
was
a
pattering
of
hoofs
and
a
jingle
of
harness
as
splendid
open
carriages
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
various
exclusive
mansions
and
a
bank
president
or
a
director
at
least
issued
forth
at
the
call
of
one
of
the
big
quadrumvirate
to
journey
to
the
home
of
arneel
such
interesting
figures
as
samuel
blackman
once
president
of
the
old
chicago
gas
company
and
now
a
director
of
the
prairie
national
hudson
baker
once
president
of
the
west
chicago
gas
company
and
now
a
director
of
the
chicago
central
national
ormonde
ricketts
publisher
of
the
chronicle
and
director
of
the
third
national
norrie
simms
president
of
the
douglas
trust
company
walter
rysam
cotton
once
an
active
wholesale
but
now
a
director
principally
of
various
institutions
were
all
en
route
it
was
a
procession
of
solemn
superior
thoughtful
gentlemen
and
all
desirous
of
giving
the
right
appearance
and
of
making
the
correct
impression
for
be
it
known
of
all
men
none
are
so
proud
or
vainglorious
over
the
minor
trappings
of
materialism
as
those
who
have
but
newly
achieved
them
it
is
so
essential
apparently
to
fulfil
in
manner
and
air
if
not
in
fact
the
principle
of
presence
which
befits
the
role
of
conservator
of
society
and
leader
of
wealth
every
one
of
those
named
and
many
more
to
the
number
of
thirty
rode
thus
loftily
forth
in
the
hot
dry
evening
air
and
were
soon
at
the
door
of
the
large
and
comfortable
home
of
timothy
arneel
that
important
personage
was
not
as
yet
present
to
receive
his
guests
and
neither
were
schryhart
hand
nor
merrill
it
would
not
be
fitting
for
such
eminent
potentates
to
receive
their
underlings
in
person
on
such
an
occasion
at
the
hour
appointed
these
four
were
still
in
their
respective
offices
perfecting
separately
the
details
of
the
plan
upon
which
they
had
agreed
and
which
with
a
show
of
informality
and
of
momentary
inspiration
they
would
later
present
for
the
time
being
their
guests
had
to
make
the
best
of
their
absence
drinks
and
liquors
were
served
but
these
were
of
small
comfort
a
rack
provided
for
straw
hats
was
for
some
reason
not
used
every
one
preferring
to
retain
his
own
against
the
background
of
wood
panneling
and
the
chairs
covered
with
summer
linen
the
company
presented
a
galleryesque
variety
and
interest
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
the
corpses
or
victims
over
which
this
serious
gathering
were
about
to
sit
in
state
were
not
actually
present
within
the
room
though
they
were
within
call
in
another
part
of
the
house
where
if
necessary
they
could
be
reached
and
their
advice
or
explanations
heard
this
presumably
brilliant
assemblage
of
the
financial
weight
and
intelligence
of
the
city
appeared
as
solemn
as
owls
under
the
pressure
of
a
rumored
impending
financial
crisis
before
appearance
there
was
a
perfect
buzz
of
minor
financial
gossip
such
as
you
do
say
is
it
as
serious
as
that
i
knew
things
were
pretty
shaky
but
i
was
by
no
means
certain
how
shaky
fortunately
we
are
not
carrying
much
of
that
stock
this
from
one
of
the
few
really
happy
bankers
this
is
a
rather
serious
occasion
is
it
you
do
tell
me
dear
dear
never
a
word
in
criticism
from
any
source
of
either
hand
or
schryhart
or
arneel
or
merrill
though
the
fact
that
they
were
back
of
the
pool
was
well
known
somehow
they
were
looked
upon
as
benefactors
who
were
calling
this
conference
with
a
view
of
saving
others
from
disaster
rather
than
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
themselves
such
phrases
as
oh
hand
marvelous
man
marvelous
or
schryhart
very
able
very
able
indeed
or
you
may
depend
on
it
these
men
are
not
going
to
allow
anything
serious
to
overtake
the
affairs
of
the
city
at
this
time
were
heard
on
every
hand
the
fact
that
immense
quantities
of
cash
or
paper
were
involved
in
behalf
of
one
or
other
of
these
four
was
secretly
admitted
by
one
banker
to
another
no
rumor
that
cowperwood
or
his
friends
had
been
profiting
or
were
in
any
way
involved
had
come
to
any
one
present
not
as
yet
at
exactly
arneel
first
ambled
in
quite
informally
hand
schryhart
and
merrill
appearing
separately
very
shortly
after
rubbing
their
hands
and
mopping
their
faces
with
their
handkerchiefs
they
looked
about
them
making
an
attempt
to
appear
as
nonchalant
and
cheerful
as
possible
under
such
trying
circumstances
there
were
many
old
acquaintances
and
friends
to
greet
inquiries
to
be
made
as
to
the
health
of
wives
and
children
arneel
clad
in
yellowish
linen
with
a
white
silk
shirt
of
lavender
stripe
and
carrying
a
fan
seemed
quite
refreshed
his
fine
expanse
of
neck
and
bosom
looked
most
paternal
and
even
abrahamesque
his
round
glistening
pate
exuded
beads
of
moisture
schryhart
on
the
contrary
for
all
the
heat
appeared
quite
hard
and
solid
as
though
he
might
be
carved
out
of
some
dark
wood
hand
much
of
arneel
type
but
more
solid
and
apparently
more
vigorous
had
donned
for
the
occasion
a
blue
serge
coat
with
trousers
of
an
almost
gaudy
bright
stripe
his
ruddy
archaic
face
was
at
once
encouraging
and
serious
as
though
he
were
saying
my
dear
children
this
is
very
trying
but
we
will
do
the
best
we
can
merrill
was
as
cool
and
ornate
and
lazy
as
it
was
possible
for
a
great
merchant
to
be
to
one
person
and
another
he
extended
a
cool
soft
hand
nodding
and
smiling
half
the
time
in
silence
to
arneel
as
the
foremost
citizen
and
the
one
of
largest
wealth
fell
the
duty
by
all
agreed
as
most
appropriate
of
assuming
the
chair
which
in
this
case
was
an
especially
large
one
at
the
head
of
the
table
there
was
a
slight
stir
as
he
finally
at
the
suggestion
of
schryhart
went
forward
and
sat
down
the
other
great
men
found
seats
well
gentlemen
began
arneel
dryly
he
had
a
low
husky
voice
i
be
as
brief
as
i
can
this
is
a
very
unusual
occasion
which
brings
us
together
i
suppose
you
all
know
how
it
is
with
mr
hull
and
stackpole
american
match
is
likely
to
come
down
with
a
crash
in
the
morning
if
something
very
radical
is
done
it
is
at
the
suggestion
of
a
number
of
men
and
banks
that
this
meeting
is
called
arneel
had
an
informal
way
of
speaking
as
if
he
were
sitting
on
a
with
one
other
person
the
failure
he
went
on
firmly
if
it
comes
as
i
hope
it
wo
will
make
a
lot
of
trouble
for
a
number
of
banks
and
private
individuals
which
we
would
like
to
avoid
i
am
sure
the
principal
creditors
of
american
match
are
our
local
banks
and
some
private
individuals
who
have
loaned
money
on
the
stock
i
have
a
list
of
them
here
along
with
the
amounts
for
which
they
are
responsible
it
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
ten
millions
of
dollars
arneel
with
the
unconscious
arrogance
of
wealth
and
power
did
not
trouble
to
explain
how
he
got
the
list
neither
did
he
show
the
slightest
perturbation
he
merely
fished
down
in
one
pocket
in
a
heavy
way
and
produced
it
spreading
it
out
on
the
table
before
him
the
company
wondered
whose
names
and
what
amounts
were
down
and
whether
it
was
his
intention
to
read
it
now
resumed
arneel
seriously
i
want
to
say
here
that
stackpole
merrill
hand
and
myself
have
been
to
a
certain
extent
investors
in
this
stock
and
up
to
this
afternoon
we
felt
it
to
be
our
duty
not
so
much
to
ourselves
as
to
the
various
banks
which
have
accepted
this
stock
as
collateral
and
to
the
city
at
large
to
sustain
it
as
much
as
possible
we
believed
in
mr
hull
and
stackpole
we
might
have
gone
still
further
if
there
had
been
any
hope
that
a
number
of
others
could
carry
the
stock
without
seriously
injuring
themselves
but
in
view
of
recent
developments
we
know
that
this
ca
be
done
for
some
time
mr
hull
and
stackpole
and
the
various
bank
officers
have
had
reason
to
think
that
some
one
has
been
cutting
the
ground
from
under
them
and
now
they
know
it
it
is
because
of
this
and
because
only
concerted
action
on
the
part
of
banks
and
individuals
can
save
the
financial
credit
of
the
city
at
this
time
that
this
meeting
is
called
stocks
are
going
to
continue
to
be
thrown
on
the
market
it
is
possible
that
hull
stackpole
may
have
to
liquidate
in
some
way
one
thing
is
certain
unless
a
large
sum
of
money
is
gathered
to
meet
the
claim
against
them
in
the
morning
they
will
fail
the
trouble
is
due
indirectly
of
course
to
this
silver
agitation
but
it
is
due
a
great
deal
more
we
believe
to
a
piece
of
local
sharp
dealing
which
has
just
come
to
light
and
which
has
really
been
the
cause
of
putting
the
financial
community
in
the
tight
place
where
it
stands
i
might
as
well
speak
plainly
as
to
this
matter
it
is
the
work
of
one
man
cowperwood
american
match
might
have
pulled
through
and
the
city
been
have
spared
the
danger
which
now
confronts
it
if
mr
hull
and
stackpole
had
not
made
the
mistake
of
going
to
this
man
arneel
paused
and
norrie
simms
more
excitable
than
most
by
temperament
chose
to
exclaim
bitterly
the
wrecker
a
stir
of
interest
passed
over
the
others
accompanied
by
murmurs
of
disapproval
the
moment
he
got
the
stock
in
his
hands
as
collateral
continued
arneel
solemnly
and
in
the
face
of
an
agreement
not
to
throw
a
share
on
the
market
he
has
been
unloading
steadily
that
is
what
has
been
happening
yesterday
and
over
fifteen
thousand
shares
of
this
stock
which
can
not
very
well
be
traced
to
outside
sources
have
been
thrown
on
the
market
and
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
all
of
it
comes
from
the
same
place
the
result
is
that
american
match
and
mr
hull
and
stackpole
are
on
the
verge
of
collapse
the
scoundrel
repeated
norrie
simms
bitterly
almost
rising
to
his
feet
the
douglas
trust
company
was
heavily
interested
in
american
match
what
an
outrage
commented
lawrence
of
the
prairie
national
which
stood
to
lose
at
least
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
shrinkage
of
values
on
hypothecated
stock
alone
to
this
bank
that
cowperwood
owed
at
least
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
call
depend
on
it
to
find
his
devil
hoof
in
it
somewhere
observed
jordan
jules
who
had
never
been
able
to
make
any
satisfactory
progress
in
his
fight
on
cowperwood
in
connection
with
the
city
council
and
the
development
of
the
chicago
general
company
the
chicago
central
of
which
he
was
now
a
director
was
one
of
the
banks
from
which
cowperwood
had
judiciously
borrowed
it
a
pity
he
should
be
allowed
to
go
on
bedeviling
the
town
in
this
fashion
observed
sunderland
sledd
to
his
neighbor
duane
kingsland
who
was
a
director
in
a
bank
controlled
by
hand
the
latter
as
well
as
schryhart
observed
with
satisfaction
the
effect
of
arneel
words
on
the
company
arneel
now
again
fished
in
his
pocket
laboriously
and
drew
forth
a
second
slip
of
paper
which
he
spread
out
before
him
this
is
a
time
when
frankness
must
prevail
he
went
on
solemnly
if
anything
is
to
be
done
and
i
am
in
hopes
that
we
can
do
something
i
have
here
a
memorandum
of
some
of
the
loans
which
the
local
banks
have
made
to
cowperwood
and
which
are
still
standing
on
their
books
i
want
to
know
if
there
are
any
further
loans
of
which
any
of
you
happen
to
know
and
which
you
are
willing
to
mention
at
this
time
he
looked
solemnly
around
immediately
several
loans
were
mentioned
by
cotton
and
osgood
which
had
not
been
heard
of
previously
the
company
was
now
very
well
aware
in
a
general
way
of
what
was
coming
well
gentlemen
continued
arneel
i
have
previous
to
this
meeting
consulted
with
a
number
of
our
leading
men
they
agree
with
me
that
since
so
many
banks
are
in
need
of
funds
to
carry
this
situation
and
since
there
is
no
particular
obligation
on
part
to
look
after
the
interests
of
cowperwood
it
might
be
just
as
well
if
these
loans
of
his
which
are
outstanding
were
called
and
the
money
used
to
aid
the
banks
and
the
men
who
have
been
behind
mr
hull
and
stackpole
i
have
no
personal
feeling
against
cowperwood
that
is
he
has
never
done
me
any
direct
injury
but
naturally
i
can
not
approve
of
the
course
he
has
seen
fit
to
take
in
this
case
now
if
there
is
money
available
from
some
source
to
enable
you
gentlemen
to
turn
around
there
will
be
a
number
of
other
failures
runs
may
be
started
on
a
banks
time
is
the
essence
of
a
situation
like
this
and
we
have
any
time
arneel
paused
and
looked
around
a
slight
buzz
of
conversation
sprang
up
mostly
bitter
and
destructive
criticism
of
cowperwood
it
would
be
only
just
if
he
could
be
made
to
pay
for
this
commented
blackman
to
sledd
he
has
been
allowed
to
play
fast
and
loose
long
enough
it
is
time
some
one
called
a
halt
on
him
well
it
looks
to
me
as
though
it
would
be
done
tonight
sledd
returned
meanwhile
schryhart
was
again
rising
to
his
feet
i
think
he
was
saying
if
there
is
no
objection
on
any
one
part
arneel
as
chairman
might
call
for
a
formal
expression
of
opinion
from
the
different
gentlemen
present
which
will
be
on
record
as
the
sense
of
this
meeting
at
this
point
kingsland
a
tall
whiskered
gentleman
arose
to
inquire
exactly
how
it
came
that
cowperwood
had
secured
these
stocks
and
whether
those
present
were
absolutely
sure
that
the
stock
has
been
coming
from
him
or
from
his
friends
i
would
not
like
to
think
we
were
doing
any
man
an
injustice
he
concluded
in
reply
to
this
schryhart
called
in
stackpole
to
corroborate
him
some
of
the
stocks
had
been
positively
identified
stackpole
related
the
full
story
which
somehow
seemed
to
electrify
the
company
so
intense
was
the
feeling
against
cowperwood
it
is
amazing
that
men
should
be
permitted
to
do
things
like
this
and
still
hold
up
their
heads
in
the
business
world
said
one
vasto
president
of
the
third
national
to
his
neighbor
i
should
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
securing
united
action
in
a
case
of
this
kind
said
lawrence
president
of
the
prairie
national
who
was
very
much
beholden
to
hand
for
past
and
present
favors
here
is
a
case
put
in
schryhart
who
was
merely
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
explain
further
in
which
an
unexpected
political
situation
develops
an
unexpected
crisis
and
this
man
uses
it
for
his
personal
aggrandizement
and
to
the
detriment
of
every
other
person
the
welfare
of
the
city
is
nothing
to
him
the
stability
of
the
very
banks
he
borrows
from
is
nothing
he
is
a
pariah
and
if
this
opportunity
to
show
him
what
we
think
of
him
and
his
methods
is
not
used
we
will
be
doing
less
than
our
duty
to
the
city
and
to
one
another
gentlemen
said
arneel
finally
after
cowperwood
different
loans
had
been
carefully
tabulated
do
you
think
it
would
be
wise
to
send
for
cowperwood
and
state
to
him
directly
the
decision
we
have
reached
and
the
reasons
for
it
i
presume
all
of
us
would
agree
that
he
should
be
notified
i
think
he
should
be
notified
said
merrill
who
saw
behind
this
smooth
talk
the
iron
club
that
was
being
brandished
both
hand
and
schryhart
looked
at
each
other
and
arneel
while
they
politely
waited
for
some
one
else
to
make
a
suggestion
when
no
one
ventured
hand
who
was
hoping
this
would
prove
a
ripping
blow
to
cowperwood
remarked
viciously
he
might
as
well
be
told
if
we
can
reach
him
it
sufficient
notice
in
my
judgment
he
might
as
well
understand
that
this
is
the
united
action
of
the
leading
financial
forces
of
the
city
quite
so
added
schryhart
it
is
time
he
understood
i
think
what
the
moneyed
men
of
this
community
think
of
him
and
his
crooked
ways
a
murmur
of
approval
ran
around
the
room
very
well
said
arneel
anson
you
know
him
better
than
some
of
the
rest
of
us
perhaps
you
had
better
see
if
you
can
get
him
on
the
telephone
and
ask
him
to
call
tell
him
that
we
are
here
in
executive
session
i
think
he
might
take
it
more
seriously
if
you
spoke
to
him
timothy
replied
merrill
arneel
being
always
a
man
of
action
arose
and
left
the
room
seeking
a
telephone
which
was
located
in
a
small
workroom
or
office
den
on
the
same
floor
where
he
could
talk
without
fear
of
being
overheard
sitting
in
his
library
on
this
particular
evening
and
studying
the
details
of
half
a
dozen
which
had
accumulated
during
the
week
cowperwood
was
decidedly
conscious
of
the
probable
collapse
of
american
match
on
the
morrow
through
his
brokers
and
agents
he
was
well
aware
that
a
conference
was
on
at
this
hour
at
the
house
of
arneel
more
than
once
during
the
day
he
had
seen
bankers
and
brokers
who
were
anxious
about
possible
shrinkage
in
connection
with
various
hypothecated
securities
and
his
valet
had
called
him
to
the
half
a
dozen
times
to
talk
with
addison
with
kaffrath
with
a
broker
by
the
name
of
prosser
who
had
succeeded
laughlin
in
active
control
of
his
private
speculations
and
also
be
it
said
with
several
of
the
banks
whose
presidents
were
at
this
particular
conference
if
cowperwood
was
hated
mistrusted
or
feared
by
the
overlords
of
these
institutions
such
was
by
no
means
the
case
with
the
underlings
some
of
whom
through
being
merely
civil
were
hopeful
of
securing
material
benefits
from
him
at
some
future
time
with
a
feeling
of
amused
satisfaction
he
was
meditating
upon
how
heavily
and
neatly
he
had
countered
on
his
enemies
whereas
they
were
speculating
as
to
how
to
offset
their
heavy
losses
on
the
morrow
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
corresponding
gains
when
all
his
deals
should
be
closed
up
he
would
clear
within
the
neighborhood
of
a
million
dollars
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
worked
messrs
hull
and
stackpole
any
great
injustice
they
were
at
their
wit
end
if
he
had
not
seized
this
opportunity
to
undercut
them
schryhart
or
arneel
would
have
done
so
anyhow
mingled
with
thoughts
of
a
forthcoming
financial
triumph
were
others
of
berenice
fleming
there
are
such
things
as
figments
of
the
brain
even
in
the
heads
of
colossi
he
thought
of
berenice
early
and
late
he
even
dreamed
of
her
he
laughed
at
himself
at
times
for
thus
being
taken
in
the
toils
of
a
mere
girl
the
strands
of
her
ruddy
hair
but
working
in
chicago
these
days
he
was
always
conscious
of
her
of
what
she
was
doing
of
where
she
was
going
in
the
east
of
how
happy
he
would
be
if
they
were
only
together
happily
mated
it
had
so
happened
unfortunately
that
in
the
course
of
this
stay
at
narragansett
berenice
among
other
diversions
had
assumed
a
certain
interest
in
one
lieutenant
lawrence
braxmar
whom
she
found
loitering
there
and
who
was
then
connected
with
the
naval
station
at
portsmouth
new
hampshire
cowperwood
coming
east
at
this
time
for
a
few
days
stay
in
order
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
his
ideal
had
been
keenly
disturbed
by
the
sight
of
braxmar
and
by
what
his
presence
might
signify
up
to
this
time
he
had
not
given
much
thought
to
younger
men
in
connection
with
her
engrossed
in
her
personality
he
could
think
of
nothing
as
being
able
to
stand
long
between
him
and
the
fulfilment
of
his
dreams
berenice
must
be
his
that
radiant
spirit
enwrapt
in
so
fair
an
outward
seeming
must
come
to
see
and
rejoice
in
him
yet
she
was
so
young
and
airy
in
her
mood
that
he
sometimes
wondered
how
was
he
to
draw
near
what
say
exactly
what
do
berenice
was
in
no
way
hypnotized
by
either
his
wealth
or
fame
she
was
accustomed
she
little
knew
to
what
extent
by
his
courtesy
to
a
world
more
resplendent
in
its
social
security
than
his
own
surveying
braxmar
keenly
upon
their
first
meeting
cowperwood
had
liked
his
face
and
intelligence
had
judged
him
to
be
able
but
had
wondered
instantly
how
he
could
get
rid
of
him
viewing
berenice
and
the
lieutenant
as
they
strolled
off
together
along
a
summery
seaside
veranda
he
had
been
for
once
lonely
and
had
sighed
these
uncertain
phases
of
affection
could
become
very
trying
at
times
he
wished
he
were
young
again
single
therefore
this
thought
was
haunting
him
like
a
gloomy
undertone
when
at
half
past
eleven
the
telephone
rang
once
more
and
he
heard
a
low
even
voice
which
said
cowperwood
this
is
mr
arneel
yes
a
number
of
the
principal
financial
men
of
the
city
are
gathered
here
at
my
house
this
evening
the
question
of
ways
and
means
of
preventing
a
panic
is
up
for
discussion
as
you
probably
know
hull
stackpole
are
in
trouble
unless
something
is
done
for
them
tonight
they
will
certainly
fail
for
twenty
million
dollars
it
is
so
much
their
failure
that
we
are
considering
as
it
is
the
effect
on
stocks
in
general
and
on
the
banks
as
i
understand
it
a
number
of
your
loans
are
involved
the
gentlemen
here
have
suggested
that
i
call
you
up
and
ask
you
to
come
here
if
you
will
to
help
us
decide
what
ought
to
be
done
something
very
drastic
will
have
to
be
decided
on
before
morning
during
this
speech
cowperwood
brain
had
been
reciprocating
like
a
machine
my
loans
he
inquired
suavely
what
have
they
to
do
with
the
situation
i
do
owe
hull
stackpole
anything
very
true
but
a
number
of
the
banks
are
carrying
securities
for
you
the
idea
is
that
a
number
of
these
will
have
to
be
called
the
majority
of
them
unless
some
other
way
can
be
devised
we
thought
you
might
possibly
wish
to
come
and
talk
it
over
and
that
you
might
be
able
to
suggest
some
other
way
out
i
see
replied
cowperwood
caustically
the
idea
is
to
sacrifice
me
in
order
to
save
hull
stackpole
is
that
it
his
eyes
quite
as
though
arneel
were
before
him
emitted
malicious
sparks
well
not
precisely
that
replied
arneel
conservatively
but
something
will
have
to
be
done
do
you
think
you
had
better
come
over
very
good
i
come
was
the
cheerful
reply
it
is
anything
that
can
be
discussed
over
the
anyhow
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
called
for
his
runabout
on
the
way
over
he
thanked
the
prevision
which
had
caused
him
in
anticipation
of
some
such
attack
as
this
to
set
aside
in
the
safety
vaults
of
the
chicago
trust
company
several
millions
in
government
bonds
now
if
worst
came
to
worst
these
could
be
drawn
on
and
hypothecated
these
men
should
see
at
last
how
powerful
he
was
and
how
secure
as
he
entered
the
home
of
arneel
he
was
a
picturesque
and
truly
representative
figure
of
his
day
in
a
light
summer
suit
of
cream
and
gray
twill
with
a
straw
hat
ornamented
by
a
band
and
wearing
yellow
of
the
softest
leather
he
appeared
a
very
model
of
trig
as
he
was
ushered
into
the
room
he
gazed
about
him
in
a
brave
leonine
way
a
fine
night
for
a
conference
gentlemen
he
said
walking
toward
a
chair
indicated
by
arneel
i
must
say
i
never
saw
so
many
straw
hats
at
a
funeral
before
i
understand
that
my
obsequies
are
contemplated
what
can
i
do
he
beamed
in
a
genial
sufficient
way
which
in
any
one
else
would
have
brought
a
smile
to
the
faces
of
the
company
in
him
it
was
an
implication
of
basic
power
which
secretly
enraged
and
envenomed
nearly
all
those
present
they
merely
stirred
in
a
nervous
and
wholly
antagonistic
way
a
number
of
those
who
knew
him
personally
nodded
merrill
lawrence
simms
but
there
was
no
friendly
light
in
their
eyes
well
gentlemen
he
inquired
after
a
moment
or
two
of
ominous
silence
observing
hand
averted
face
and
schryhart
eyes
which
were
lifted
ceilingward
cowperwood
began
arneel
quietly
in
no
way
disturbed
by
cowperwood
jaunty
air
as
i
told
you
over
the
this
meeting
is
called
to
avert
if
possible
what
is
likely
to
be
a
very
serious
panic
in
the
morning
hull
stackpole
are
on
the
verge
of
failure
the
outstanding
loans
are
considerable
in
the
neighborhood
of
seven
or
eight
million
here
in
chicago
on
the
other
hand
there
are
assets
in
the
shape
of
american
match
stocks
and
other
properties
sufficient
to
carry
them
for
a
while
longer
if
the
banks
can
only
continue
their
loans
as
you
know
we
are
all
facing
a
falling
market
and
the
banks
are
short
of
ready
money
something
has
to
be
done
we
have
canvassed
the
situation
here
as
thoroughly
as
possible
and
the
general
conclusion
is
that
your
loans
are
among
the
most
available
assets
which
can
be
reached
quickly
schryhart
merrill
hand
and
myself
have
done
all
we
can
thus
far
to
avert
a
calamity
but
we
find
that
some
one
with
whom
hull
stackpole
have
been
hypothecating
stocks
has
been
feeding
them
out
in
order
to
break
the
market
we
shall
know
how
to
avoid
that
in
the
future
and
he
looked
hard
at
cowperwood
but
the
thing
at
present
is
immediate
cash
and
your
loans
are
the
largest
and
the
most
available
do
you
think
you
can
find
the
means
to
pay
them
back
in
the
morning
arneel
blinked
his
keen
blue
eyes
solemnly
while
the
rest
like
a
pack
of
genial
but
hungry
wolves
sat
and
surveyed
this
apparently
whole
but
now
condemned
scapegoat
and
victim
cowperwood
who
was
keenly
alive
to
the
spirit
of
the
company
looked
blandly
and
fearlessly
around
on
his
knee
he
held
his
blue
banded
straw
hat
neatly
balanced
on
one
edge
his
full
mustache
curled
upward
in
a
jaunty
arrogant
way
i
can
meet
my
loans
he
replied
easily
but
i
would
not
advise
you
or
any
of
the
gentlemen
present
to
call
them
his
voice
for
all
its
lightness
had
an
ominous
ring
why
not
inquired
hand
grimly
and
heavily
turning
squarely
about
and
facing
him
it
does
appear
that
you
have
extended
any
particular
courtesy
to
hull
or
stackpole
his
face
was
red
and
scowling
because
replied
cowperwood
smiling
and
ignoring
the
reference
to
his
trick
i
know
why
this
meeting
was
called
i
know
that
these
gentlemen
here
who
are
not
saying
a
word
are
mere
catspaws
and
rubber
stamps
for
you
and
schryhart
and
arneel
and
merrill
i
know
how
you
four
gentlemen
have
been
gambling
in
this
stock
and
what
your
probable
losses
are
and
that
it
is
to
save
yourselves
from
further
loss
that
you
have
decided
to
make
me
the
scapegoat
i
want
to
tell
you
here
and
he
got
up
so
that
in
his
full
stature
he
loomed
over
the
room
you
ca
do
it
you
ca
make
me
your
catspaw
to
pull
your
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
and
no
conference
can
make
any
such
attempt
successful
if
you
want
to
know
what
to
do
tell
you
close
the
chicago
stock
exchange
morning
and
keep
it
closed
then
let
hull
stackpole
fail
or
if
not
you
four
put
up
the
money
to
carry
them
if
you
ca
let
your
banks
do
it
if
you
open
the
day
by
calling
a
single
one
of
my
loans
before
i
am
ready
to
pay
it
i
gut
every
bank
from
here
to
the
river
you
have
panic
all
the
panic
you
want
good
evening
gentlemen
he
drew
out
his
watch
glanced
at
it
and
quickly
walked
to
the
door
putting
on
his
hat
as
he
went
as
he
bustled
jauntily
down
the
wide
interior
staircase
preceded
by
a
footman
to
open
the
door
a
murmur
of
dissatisfaction
arose
in
the
room
he
had
just
left
the
wrecker
norrie
simms
angrily
astounded
at
this
demonstration
of
defiance
the
scoundrel
declared
blackman
where
does
he
get
the
wealth
to
talk
like
that
gentlemen
said
arneel
stung
to
the
quick
by
this
amazing
effrontery
and
yet
made
cautious
by
the
blazing
wrath
of
cowperwood
it
is
useless
to
debate
this
question
in
anger
cowperwood
evidently
refers
to
loans
which
can
be
controlled
in
his
favor
and
of
which
i
for
one
know
nothing
i
do
not
see
what
can
be
done
until
we
do
know
perhaps
some
of
you
can
tell
us
what
they
are
but
no
one
could
and
after
due
calculation
advice
was
borrowed
of
caution
the
loans
of
frank
algernon
cowperwood
were
not
called
chapter
l
a
new
york
mansion
the
failure
of
american
match
the
next
morning
was
one
of
those
events
that
stirred
the
city
and
the
nation
and
lingered
in
the
minds
of
men
for
years
at
the
last
moment
it
was
decided
that
in
lieu
of
calling
cowperwood
loans
hull
stackpole
had
best
be
sacrificed
the
closed
and
all
trading
ended
this
protected
stocks
from
at
least
a
quotable
decline
and
left
the
banks
free
for
several
days
ten
all
told
in
which
to
repair
their
disrupted
finances
and
buttress
themselves
against
the
eventual
facts
naturally
the
minor
speculators
throughout
the
city
those
who
had
expected
to
make
a
fortune
out
of
this
crash
raged
and
complained
but
being
faced
by
an
adamantine
exchange
directorate
a
subservient
press
and
the
alliance
between
the
big
bankers
and
the
heavy
quadrumvirate
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
respective
bank
presidents
talked
solemnly
of
a
mere
temporary
flurry
hand
schryhart
merrill
and
arneel
went
still
further
into
their
pockets
to
protect
their
interests
and
cowperwood
triumphant
was
roundly
denounced
by
the
smaller
fry
as
a
bucaneer
a
pirate
a
wolf
indeed
any
opprobrious
term
that
came
into
their
minds
the
larger
men
faced
squarely
the
fact
that
here
was
an
enemy
worthy
of
their
steel
would
he
master
them
was
he
already
the
dominant
money
power
in
chicago
could
he
thus
flaunt
their
helplessness
and
his
superiority
in
their
eyes
and
before
their
underlings
and
go
unwhipped
i
must
give
in
hosmer
hand
had
declared
to
arneel
and
schryhart
at
the
close
of
the
arneel
house
conference
and
as
they
stood
in
consultation
after
the
others
had
departed
we
seem
to
be
beaten
but
i
for
one
am
not
through
yet
he
has
won
but
he
wo
win
always
this
is
a
fight
to
a
finish
between
me
and
him
the
rest
of
you
can
stay
in
or
drop
out
just
as
you
wish
hear
hear
exclaimed
schryhart
laying
a
fervently
sympathetic
hand
on
his
shoulder
every
dollar
that
i
have
is
at
your
service
hosmer
this
fellow
ca
win
eventually
i
with
you
to
the
end
arneel
walking
with
merrill
and
the
others
to
the
door
was
silent
and
dour
he
had
been
cavalierly
affronted
by
a
man
who
but
a
few
short
years
before
he
would
have
considered
a
mere
underling
here
was
cowperwood
bearding
the
lion
in
his
den
dictating
terms
to
the
principal
financial
figures
of
the
city
standing
up
trig
and
resolute
smiling
in
their
faces
and
telling
them
in
so
many
words
to
go
to
the
devil
arneel
glowered
under
lowering
brows
but
what
could
he
do
we
must
see
he
said
to
the
others
what
time
will
bring
just
now
there
is
nothing
much
to
do
this
crisis
has
been
too
sudden
you
say
you
are
not
through
with
him
hosmer
and
neither
am
i
but
we
must
wait
we
shall
have
to
break
him
politically
in
this
city
and
i
am
confident
that
in
the
end
we
can
do
it
the
others
were
grateful
for
his
courage
even
though
he
and
they
must
part
with
millions
to
protect
themselves
and
the
banks
for
the
first
time
merrill
concluded
that
he
would
have
to
fight
cowperwood
openly
from
now
on
though
even
yet
he
admired
his
courage
but
he
is
too
defiant
too
cavalier
a
very
lion
of
a
man
he
said
to
himself
a
man
with
the
heart
of
a
numidian
lion
it
was
true
from
this
day
on
for
a
little
while
and
because
there
was
no
immediate
political
contest
in
sight
there
was
comparative
peace
in
chicago
although
it
more
resembled
an
armed
camp
operating
under
the
terms
of
some
agreed
neutrality
than
it
did
anything
else
schryhart
hand
arneel
and
merrill
were
quietly
watchful
cowperwood
chief
concern
was
lest
his
enemies
might
succeed
in
their
project
of
worsting
him
politically
in
one
or
all
three
of
the
succeeding
elections
which
were
due
to
occur
every
two
years
between
now
and
at
which
time
his
franchises
would
have
to
be
renewed
as
in
the
past
they
had
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
work
against
them
through
bribery
and
perjury
so
in
ensuing
struggles
they
might
render
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
or
his
agents
to
suborn
the
men
elected
to
office
the
subservient
and
venal
councilmen
whom
he
now
controlled
might
be
replaced
by
men
who
if
no
more
honest
would
be
more
loyal
to
the
enemy
thus
blocking
the
extension
of
his
franchises
yet
upon
a
renewal
period
of
at
least
twenty
and
preferably
fifty
years
depended
the
fulfilment
of
all
the
colossal
things
he
had
begun
his
his
new
mansion
his
growing
prestige
as
a
financier
his
rehabilitation
socially
and
the
celebration
of
his
triumph
by
a
union
morganatic
or
otherwise
with
some
one
who
would
be
worthy
to
share
his
throne
it
is
curious
how
that
first
and
most
potent
tendency
of
the
human
mind
ambition
becomes
finally
dominating
here
was
cowperwood
at
rich
beyond
the
wildest
dream
of
the
average
man
celebrated
in
a
local
and
in
some
respects
in
a
national
way
who
was
nevertheless
feeling
that
by
no
means
had
his
true
aims
been
achieved
he
was
not
yet
as
were
divers
eastern
magnates
or
even
these
four
or
five
magnificently
moneyed
men
here
in
chicago
who
by
plodding
thought
and
labor
in
many
dreary
fields
such
as
cowperwood
himself
frequently
scorned
had
reaped
tremendous
and
uncontended
profits
how
was
it
he
asked
himself
that
his
path
had
almost
constantly
been
strewn
with
stormy
opposition
and
threatened
calamity
was
it
due
to
his
private
immorality
other
men
were
immoral
the
mass
despite
religious
dogma
and
theory
imposed
from
the
top
was
generally
so
was
it
not
rather
due
to
his
inability
to
control
without
dominating
personally
without
standing
out
fully
and
clearly
in
the
sight
of
all
men
sometimes
he
thought
so
the
humdrum
conventional
world
could
not
brook
his
daring
his
insouciance
his
constant
desire
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
his
genial
sufficiency
was
a
taunt
and
a
mockery
to
many
the
hard
implication
of
his
eye
was
dreaded
by
the
weaker
as
fire
is
feared
by
a
burnt
child
dissembling
enough
he
was
not
sufficiently
oily
and
well
come
what
might
he
did
not
need
to
be
or
mean
to
be
so
and
there
the
game
must
lie
but
he
had
not
by
any
means
attained
the
height
of
his
ambition
he
was
not
yet
looked
upon
as
a
money
prince
he
could
not
rank
as
yet
with
the
magnates
of
the
east
the
serried
sequoias
of
wall
street
until
he
could
stand
with
these
men
until
he
could
have
a
magnificent
mansion
acknowledged
as
such
by
all
until
he
could
have
a
gallery
berenice
millions
what
did
it
avail
the
character
of
cowperwood
new
york
house
which
proved
one
of
the
central
achievements
of
his
later
years
was
one
of
those
flowerings
out
of
disposition
which
eventuate
in
the
case
of
men
quite
as
in
that
of
plants
after
the
passing
of
the
years
neither
a
modified
gothic
such
as
his
philadelphia
house
had
been
nor
a
conventionalized
after
the
style
of
his
michigan
avenue
home
seemed
suitable
to
him
only
the
italian
palaces
of
medieval
or
renaissance
origin
which
he
had
seen
abroad
now
appealed
to
him
as
examples
of
what
a
stately
residence
should
be
he
was
really
seeking
something
which
should
not
only
reflect
his
private
tastes
as
to
a
home
but
should
have
the
more
enduring
qualities
of
a
palace
or
even
a
museum
which
might
stand
as
a
monument
to
his
memory
after
much
searching
cowperwood
had
found
an
architect
in
new
york
who
suited
him
entirely
one
raymond
pyne
rake
raconteur
who
was
still
first
and
foremost
an
artist
with
an
eye
for
the
exceptional
and
the
perfect
these
two
spent
days
and
days
together
meditating
on
the
details
of
this
home
museum
an
immense
gallery
was
to
occupy
the
west
wing
of
the
house
and
be
devoted
to
pictures
a
second
gallery
should
occupy
the
south
wing
and
be
given
over
to
sculpture
and
large
whorls
of
art
and
these
two
wings
were
to
swing
as
an
l
around
the
house
proper
the
latter
standing
in
the
angle
between
them
the
whole
structure
was
to
be
of
a
rich
brownstone
heavily
carved
for
its
interior
decoration
the
richest
woods
silks
tapestries
glass
and
marbles
were
canvassed
the
main
rooms
were
to
surround
a
great
central
court
with
a
colonnade
of
alabaster
and
in
the
center
there
would
be
an
electrically
lighted
fountain
of
alabaster
and
silver
occupying
the
east
wall
a
series
of
hanging
baskets
of
orchids
or
of
other
fresh
flowers
were
to
give
a
splendid
glow
of
color
a
effect
to
this
richly
artificial
realm
one
chamber
a
lounge
on
the
second
floor
was
to
be
entirely
lined
with
transparent
marble
of
a
hue
the
lighting
coming
only
through
these
walls
and
from
without
here
in
a
perpetual
atmosphere
of
sunrise
were
to
be
racks
for
exotic
birds
a
trellis
of
vines
stone
benches
a
central
pool
of
glistening
water
and
an
echo
of
music
pyne
assured
him
that
after
his
death
this
room
would
make
an
excellent
chamber
in
which
to
exhibit
porcelains
jades
ivories
and
other
small
objects
of
value
cowperwood
was
now
actually
transferring
his
possessions
to
new
york
and
had
persuaded
aileen
to
accompany
him
fine
compound
of
tact
and
chicane
that
he
was
he
had
the
effrontery
to
assure
her
that
they
could
here
create
a
happier
social
life
his
present
plan
was
to
pretend
a
marital
contentment
which
had
no
basis
solely
in
order
to
make
this
transition
period
as
undisturbed
as
possible
subsequently
he
might
get
a
divorce
or
he
might
make
an
arrangement
whereby
his
life
would
be
rendered
happy
outside
the
social
pale
of
all
this
berenice
fleming
knew
nothing
at
all
at
the
same
time
the
building
of
this
splendid
mansion
eventually
awakened
her
to
an
understanding
of
the
spirit
of
art
that
occupied
the
center
of
cowperwood
iron
personality
and
caused
her
to
take
a
real
interest
in
him
before
this
she
had
looked
on
him
as
a
kind
of
western
interloper
coming
east
and
taking
advantage
of
her
mother
good
nature
to
scrape
a
little
social
courtesy
now
however
all
that
carter
had
been
telling
her
of
his
personality
and
achievements
was
becoming
crystallized
into
a
glittering
chain
of
facts
this
house
the
papers
were
fond
of
repeating
would
be
a
jewel
of
rare
workmanship
obviously
the
cowperwoods
were
going
to
try
to
enter
society
what
a
pity
it
is
carter
once
said
to
berenice
that
he
could
have
gotten
a
divorce
from
his
wife
before
he
began
all
this
i
am
so
afraid
they
will
never
be
received
he
would
be
if
he
only
had
the
right
woman
but
she
carter
who
had
once
seen
aileen
in
chicago
shook
her
head
doubtfully
she
is
not
the
type
was
her
comment
she
has
neither
the
air
nor
the
understanding
if
he
is
so
unhappy
with
her
observed
berenice
thoughtfully
why
does
he
leave
her
she
can
be
happy
without
him
it
is
so
silly
this
existence
still
i
suppose
she
values
the
position
he
gives
her
she
added
since
she
is
so
interesting
herself
i
suppose
said
carter
that
he
married
her
twenty
years
ago
when
he
was
a
very
different
man
from
what
he
is
she
is
not
exactly
coarse
but
not
clever
enough
she
can
not
do
what
he
would
like
to
see
done
i
hate
to
see
mismatings
of
this
kind
and
yet
they
are
so
common
i
do
hope
bevy
that
when
you
marry
it
will
be
some
one
with
whom
you
can
get
along
though
i
do
believe
i
would
rather
see
you
unhappy
than
poor
this
was
delivered
as
an
early
breakfast
peroration
in
central
park
south
with
the
morning
sun
glittering
on
one
of
the
nearest
park
lakes
bevy
in
and
was
studying
the
social
notes
in
one
of
the
morning
papers
i
think
i
should
prefer
to
be
unhappy
with
wealth
than
to
be
without
it
she
said
idly
without
looking
up
her
mother
surveyed
her
admiringly
conscious
of
her
imperious
mood
what
was
to
become
of
her
would
she
marry
well
would
she
marry
in
time
thus
far
no
breath
of
the
wretched
days
in
louisville
had
affected
berenice
most
of
those
with
whom
carter
had
found
herself
compelled
to
deal
would
be
kind
enough
to
keep
her
secret
but
there
were
others
how
near
she
had
been
to
drifting
on
the
rocks
when
cowperwood
had
appeared
after
all
observed
berenice
thoughtfully
cowperwood
is
a
mere
is
he
so
many
of
these
western
moneyed
men
are
so
dull
my
dear
exclaimed
carter
who
by
now
had
become
a
confirmed
satellite
of
her
secret
protector
you
do
understand
him
at
all
he
is
a
very
astonishing
man
i
tell
you
the
world
is
certain
to
hear
a
lot
more
of
frank
cowperwood
before
he
dies
you
can
say
what
you
please
but
some
one
has
to
make
the
money
in
the
first
place
little
enough
that
good
breeding
does
for
you
in
poverty
i
know
because
i
seen
plenty
of
our
friends
come
down
in
the
new
house
on
a
scaffold
one
day
a
famous
sculptor
and
his
assistants
were
at
work
on
a
greek
frieze
which
represented
dancing
nymphs
linked
together
by
looped
wreaths
berenice
and
her
mother
happened
to
be
passing
they
stopped
to
look
and
cowperwood
joined
them
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
figures
of
the
frieze
and
said
to
berenice
with
his
old
gay
air
if
they
had
copied
you
they
would
have
done
better
how
charming
of
you
she
replied
with
her
cool
strange
blue
eyes
fixed
on
him
they
are
beautiful
in
spite
of
her
earlier
prejudices
she
knew
now
that
he
and
she
had
one
god
in
common
art
and
that
his
mind
was
fixed
on
things
beautiful
as
on
a
shrine
he
merely
looked
at
her
this
house
can
be
little
more
than
a
museum
to
me
he
remarked
simply
when
her
mother
was
out
of
hearing
but
i
shall
build
it
as
perfectly
as
i
can
perhaps
others
may
enjoy
it
if
i
do
not
she
looked
at
him
musingly
understandingly
and
he
smiled
she
realized
of
course
that
he
was
trying
to
convey
to
her
that
he
was
lonely
chapter
li
the
revival
of
hattie
starr
engrossed
in
the
pleasures
and
entertainments
which
cowperwood
money
was
providing
berenice
had
until
recently
given
very
little
thought
to
her
future
cowperwood
had
been
most
liberal
she
is
young
he
once
said
to
carter
with
an
air
of
disinterested
liberality
when
they
were
talking
about
berenice
and
her
future
she
is
an
exquisite
let
her
have
her
day
if
she
marries
well
she
can
pay
you
back
or
me
but
give
her
all
she
needs
now
and
he
signed
checks
with
the
air
of
a
gardener
who
is
growing
a
wondrous
orchid
the
truth
was
that
carter
had
become
so
fond
of
berenice
as
an
object
of
beauty
a
prospective
grande
dame
that
she
would
have
sold
her
soul
to
see
her
well
placed
and
as
the
money
to
provide
the
dresses
setting
equipage
had
to
come
from
somewhere
she
had
placed
her
spirit
in
subjection
to
cowperwood
and
pretended
not
to
see
the
compromising
position
in
which
she
was
placing
all
that
was
near
and
dear
to
her
oh
you
so
good
she
more
than
once
said
to
him
a
mist
of
gratitude
commingled
with
joy
in
her
eyes
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
any
one
but
bevy
an
esthete
is
an
esthete
cowperwood
replied
they
are
rare
enough
i
like
to
see
a
spirit
as
fine
as
hers
move
untroubled
she
will
make
her
way
seeing
lieutenant
braxmar
in
the
foreground
of
berenice
affairs
carter
was
foolish
enough
to
harp
on
the
matter
in
a
friendly
ingratiating
way
braxmar
was
really
interesting
after
his
fashion
he
was
young
tall
muscular
and
handsome
a
graceful
dancer
but
better
yet
he
represented
in
his
moods
lineage
social
position
a
number
of
the
things
which
engaged
berenice
most
he
was
intelligent
serious
with
a
kind
of
social
grace
which
was
gay
courteous
wistful
berenice
met
him
first
at
a
local
dance
where
a
new
step
was
being
practised
dancing
in
the
barn
as
it
was
called
and
so
airily
did
he
tread
it
with
her
in
his
handsome
uniform
that
she
was
half
smitten
for
the
moment
you
dance
delightfully
she
said
is
this
a
part
of
your
life
on
the
ocean
wave
dancing
he
replied
with
a
heavenly
smile
all
battles
are
accompanied
by
balls
do
you
know
oh
what
a
wretched
jest
she
replied
it
unbelievably
bad
not
for
me
i
can
make
much
worse
ones
not
for
me
she
replied
i
ca
stand
them
and
they
went
prancing
on
afterward
he
came
and
sat
by
her
they
walked
in
the
moonlight
he
told
her
of
naval
life
his
southern
home
and
connections
carter
seeing
him
with
berenice
and
having
been
introduced
observed
the
next
morning
i
like
your
lieutenant
bevy
i
know
some
of
his
relatives
well
they
come
from
the
carolinas
he
sure
to
come
into
money
the
whole
family
is
wealthy
do
you
think
he
might
be
interested
in
you
oh
possibly
yes
i
presume
so
replied
berenice
airily
for
she
did
not
take
too
kindly
to
this
evidence
of
parental
interest
she
preferred
to
see
life
drift
on
in
some
nebulous
way
at
present
and
this
was
bringing
matters
too
close
to
home
still
he
has
so
much
machinery
on
his
mind
i
doubt
whether
he
could
take
any
serious
interest
in
a
woman
he
is
almost
more
of
a
than
he
is
a
man
she
made
a
mouth
and
carter
commented
gaily
you
rogue
all
the
men
take
an
interest
in
you
you
do
think
you
could
care
for
him
then
at
all
why
mother
what
a
question
why
do
you
ask
is
it
so
essential
that
i
should
oh
not
that
exactly
replied
carter
sweetly
bracing
herself
for
a
word
which
she
felt
incumbent
upon
her
but
think
of
his
position
he
comes
of
such
a
good
family
and
he
must
be
heir
to
a
considerable
fortune
in
his
own
right
oh
bevy
i
do
want
to
hurry
or
spoil
your
life
in
any
way
but
do
keep
in
mind
the
future
with
your
tastes
and
instincts
money
is
so
essential
and
unless
you
marry
it
i
do
know
where
you
are
to
get
it
your
father
was
so
thoughtless
and
rolfe
was
even
worse
she
sighed
berenice
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
took
solemn
heed
of
this
thought
she
pondered
whether
she
could
endure
braxmar
as
a
life
partner
follow
him
around
the
world
perhaps
retransferring
her
abode
to
the
south
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
this
suggestion
on
the
part
of
her
mother
rather
poisoned
the
cup
for
her
to
tell
the
truth
in
this
hour
of
doubt
her
thoughts
turned
vaguely
to
cowperwood
as
one
who
represented
in
his
avid
way
more
of
the
things
she
truly
desired
she
remembered
his
wealth
his
plaint
that
his
new
house
could
be
only
a
museum
the
manner
in
which
he
approached
her
with
looks
and
voiceless
suggestions
but
he
was
old
and
married
out
of
the
question
therefore
and
braxmar
was
young
and
charming
to
think
her
mother
should
have
been
so
tactless
as
to
suggest
the
necessity
for
consideration
in
his
case
it
almost
spoiled
him
for
her
and
was
their
financial
state
then
as
uncertain
as
her
mother
indicated
in
this
crisis
some
of
her
previous
social
experiences
became
significant
for
instance
only
a
few
weeks
previous
to
her
meeting
with
braxmar
she
had
been
visiting
at
the
country
estate
of
the
corscaden
batjers
at
redding
hills
long
island
and
had
been
sitting
with
her
hostess
in
the
morning
room
of
hillcrest
which
commanded
a
lovely
though
distant
view
of
long
island
sound
fredericka

was
a

blonde

she
had
in
her
lap
on
this
occasion
a

filled
with
some

at

she
said
you

at
the

last
summer
when
you
were

berenice
who
was
seated
at
a

chippendale
penning
letters
glanced
up
her
mind
visioning
for
the
moment
the
youth
in
question
kilmer
duelma
tall
stocky
swaggering
his
clothes
the
loose
nonchalant
perfection
of
the
season
his
walk
ambling
studied
lackadaisical
aimless
his
color
high
his
cheeks
full
his
eyes
a
little
vacuous
his
mind
acquiescing
in
a
sort
of
genial
inconsequential
way
to
every
query
and
thought
that
was
put
to
him
the
younger
of
the
two
sons
of
auguste
duelma
banker
promoter
multimillionaire
he
would
come
into
a
fortune
estimated
roughly
at
between
six
and
eight
millions
at
the
haggertys
the
year
before
he
had
hung
about
her
in
an
aimless
fashion
batjer
studied
berenice
curiously
for
a
moment
then
returned
to
her
needlework
i
asked
him
down
over
this
she
suggested
yes
queried
berenice
sweetly
are
there
others
of
course
assented
batjer
remotely
kilmer
does
interest
you
i
presume
berenice
smiled
enigmatically
you
remember
clarissa
faulkner
do
you
bevy
pursued
batjer
she
married
romulus
garrison
perfectly
where
is
she
now
they
have
leased
the
chateau
brieul
at
ars
for
the
winter
romulus
is
a
fool
but
clarissa
is
so
clever
you
know
she
writes
that
she
is
holding
a
veritable
court
there
this
season
half
the
smart
set
of
paris
and
london
are
dropping
in
it
is
so
charming
for
her
to
be
able
to
do
those
things
now
poor
dear
at
one
time
i
was
quite
troubled
over
her
without
giving
any
outward
sign
berenice
did
not
fail
to
gather
the
full
import
of
the
analogy
it
was
all
true
one
must
begin
early
to
take
thought
of
one
life
she
suffered
a
disturbing
sense
of
duty
kilmer
duelma
arrived
at
noon
friday
with
six
types
of
bags
a
special
valet
and
a
preposterous
enthusiasm
for
polo
and
hunting
diseases
lately
acquired
from
a
hunting
set
in
the
berkshires
a
cleverly
contrived
compliment
supposed
to
have
emanated
from
miss
fleming
and
conveyed
to
him
with
tact
by
batjer
brought
him
ambling
into
berenice
presence
suggesting
a
sunday
drive
to
saddle
rock
haw
haw
you
know
i
delighted
to
see
you
again
haw
haw
been
an
age
since
i
seen
the
haggertys
we
missed
you
after
you
left
haw
haw
i
did
you
know
since
i
saw
you
i
have
taken
up
polo
three
ponies
with
me
all
the
time
now
haw
haw
a
regular
stable
nearly
berenice
strove
valiantly
to
retain
a
serene
interest
duty
was
in
her
mind
the
chateau
brieul
the
winter
court
of
clarissa
garrison
some
first
premonitions
of
the
flight
of
time
yet
the
drive
was
a
bore
conversation
a
burden
the
struggle
to
respond
titanic
impossible
when
monday
came
she
fled
leaving
three
days
between
that
and
a
at
morristown
batjer
who
read
straws
most
capably
sighed
her
own
corscaden
was
not
much
beyond
his
money
but
life
must
be
lived
and
the
ambitious
must
inherit
wealth
or
gather
it
wisely
some
impossible
scheming
silly
would
soon
collect
duelma
and
then
she
considered
berenice
a
little
difficult
berenice
could
not
help
piecing
together
the
memory
of
this
incident
with
her
mother
recent
appeal
in
behalf
of
lieutenant
braxmar
a
great
cloying
disturbing
disintegrating
factor
in
her
life
was
revealed
by
the
dawning
discovery
that
she
and
her
mother
were
without
much
money
that
aside
from
her
lineage
she
was
in
a
certain
sense
an
interloper
in
society
there
were
never
rumors
of
great
wealth
in
connection
with
her
no
flattering
whispers
or
public
notices
regarding
her
station
as
an
heiress
all
the
smug
minor
manikins
of
the
social
world
were
on
the
qui
vive
for
some
doll
of
a
girl
with
an
endless
by
nature
sybaritic
an
intense
lover
of
art
fabrics
of
stately
functions
of
power
and
success
in
every
form
she
had
been
dreaming
all
this
while
of
a
great
and
under
some
such
circumstances
as
the
greatest
individual
wealth
of
the
day
and
only
that
could
provide
simultaneously
she
had
vaguely
cherished
the
idea
that
if
she
ever
found
some
one
who
was
truly
fond
of
her
and
whom
she
could
love
or
even
admire
intensely
some
one
who
needed
her
in
a
deep
sincere
way
she
would
give
herself
freely
and
gladly
yet
who
could
it
be
she
had
been
charmed
by
braxmar
but
her
keen
analytic
intelligence
required
some
one
harder
more
vivid
more
ruthless
some
one
who
would
appeal
to
her
as
an
immense
force
yet
she
must
be
conservative
she
must
play
what
cards
she
had
to
win
during
his
summer
visit
at
narragansett
cowperwood
had
not
been
long
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
braxmar
for
having
received
special
orders
the
latter
was
compelled
to
hurry
away
to
hampton
roads
but
the
following
november
forsaking
temporarily
his
difficult
affairs
in
chicago
for
new
york
and
the
carter
apartment
in
central
park
south
cowperwood
again
encountered
the
lieutenant
who
arrived
one
evening
brilliantly
arrayed
in
full
official
regalia
in
order
to
escort
berenice
to
a
ball
a
high
military
cap
surmounting
his
handsome
face
his
epaulets
gleaming
in
gold
the
lapels
of
his
cape
thrown
back
to
reveal
a
handsome
red
silken
lining
his
sword
clanking
by
his
side
he
seemed
a
veritable
singing
flame
of
youth
cowperwood
caught
in
the
drift
of
circumstance
age
unsuitableness
the
flaring
of
romance
and
vigor
fairly
writhed
in
pain
berenice
was
so
beautiful
in
a
storm
of
diaphanous
clinging
garments
he
stared
at
them
from
an
adjacent
room
where
he
pretended
to
be
reading
and
sighed
alas
how
was
his
cunning
and
foresight
even
his
to
overcome
the
drift
of
life
itself
how
was
he
to
make
himself
appealing
to
youth
braxmar
had
the
years
the
color
the
bearing
berenice
seemed
as
she
prepared
to
leave
to
be
fairly
seething
with
youth
hope
gaiety
he
arose
after
a
few
moments
and
giving
business
as
an
excuse
hurried
away
but
it
was
only
to
sit
in
his
own
rooms
in
a
neighboring
hotel
and
meditate
the
logic
of
the
ordinary
man
under
such
circumstances
compounded
of
the
notions
of
chivalry
duty
to
higher
impulses
and
the
like
would
have
been
to
step
aside
in
favor
of
youth
to
give
convention
its
day
and
retire
in
favor
of
morality
and
virtue
cowperwood
saw
things
in
no
such
moralistic
or
altruistic
light
i
satisfy
myself
had
ever
been
his
motto
and
under
that
however
much
he
might
sympathize
with
berenice
in
love
or
with
love
itself
he
was
not
content
to
withdraw
until
he
was
sure
that
the
end
of
hope
for
him
had
really
come
there
had
been
moments
between
him
and
berenice
little
approximations
toward
intimacy
which
had
led
him
to
believe
that
by
no
means
was
she
seriously
opposed
to
him
at
the
same
time
this
business
of
the
lieutenant
so
carter
confided
to
him
a
little
later
was
not
to
be
regarded
lightly
while
berenice
might
not
care
so
much
obviously
braxmar
did
ever
since
he
has
been
away
he
has
been
storming
her
with
letters
she
remarked
to
cowperwood
one
afternoon
i
do
think
he
is
the
kind
that
can
be
made
to
take
no
for
an
answer
a
very
successful
kind
commented
cowperwood
dryly
carter
was
eager
for
advice
in
the
matter
braxmar
was
a
man
of
parts
she
knew
his
connections
he
would
inherit
at
least
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
at
his
father
death
if
not
more
what
about
her
louisville
record
supposing
that
should
come
out
later
would
it
not
be
wise
for
berenice
to
marry
and
have
the
danger
over
with
it
is
a
problem
is
it
observed
cowperwood
calmly
are
you
sure
she
in
love
oh
i
would
say
that
but
such
things
so
easily
turn
into
love
i
have
never
believed
that
berenice
could
be
swept
off
her
feet
by
any
one
she
is
so
thoughtful
but
she
knows
she
has
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
and
braxmar
is
certainly
eligible
i
know
his
cousins
the
clifford
porters
very
well
cowperwood
knitted
his
brows
he
was
sick
to
his
soul
with
this
worry
over
berenice
he
felt
that
he
must
have
her
even
at
the
cost
of
inflicting
upon
her
a
serious
social
injury
better
that
she
should
surmount
it
with
him
than
escape
it
with
another
it
so
happened
however
that
the
final
grim
necessity
of
acting
on
any
such
idea
was
spared
him
imagine
a
in
one
of
the
principal
hotels
of
new
york
the
hour
midnight
after
an
evening
at
the
opera
to
which
cowperwood
as
host
had
invited
berenice
lieutenant
braxmar
and
carter
he
was
now
playing
the
role
of
disinterested
host
and
avuncular
mentor
his
attitude
toward
berenice
meditating
as
he
was
a
course
which
should
be
destructive
to
braxmar
was
gentle
courteous
serenely
thoughtful
like
a
true
mephistopheles
he
was
waiting
surveying
carter
and
berenice
who
were
seated
in
front
chairs
clad
in
such
exotic
draperies
as
affect
carter
in
silk
and
diamonds
berenice
in
purple
and
with
a
jeweled
comb
in
her
hair
the
lieutenant
in
his
dazzling
uniform
smiled
and
talked
blandly
complimented
the
singers
whispered
pleasant
nothings
to
berenice
descanted
at
odd
moments
to
cowperwood
on
naval
personages
who
happened
to
be
present
coming
out
of
the
opera
and
driving
through
blowy
windy
streets
to
the
waldorf
they
took
the
table
reserved
for
them
and
cowperwood
after
consulting
with
regard
to
the
dishes
and
ordering
the
wine
went
back
reminiscently
to
the
music
which
had
been
la
boheme
the
death
of
mimi
and
the
grief
of
rodolph
as
voiced
by
the
splendid
melodies
of
puccini
interested
him
that
makeshift
studio
world
may
have
no
connection
with
the
genuine
professional
artist
but
it
very
representative
of
life
he
remarked
i
do
know
i
sure
said
braxmar
seriously
all
i
know
of
bohemia
is
what
i
have
read
in
books
trilby
for
instance
and
he
could
think
of
no
other
and
stopped
i
suppose
it
is
that
way
in
paris
he
looked
at
berenice
for
confirmation
and
to
win
a
smile
owing
to
her
mobile
and
sympathetic
disposition
she
had
during
the
opera
been
swept
from
period
to
period
by
surges
of
beauty
too
gay
or
pathetic
for
words
but
clearly
comprehended
of
the
spirit
once
when
she
had
been
lost
in
dreamy
contemplation
her
hands
folded
on
her
knees
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
stage
both
braxmar
and
cowperwood
had
studied
her
parted
lips
and
fine
profile
with
common
impulses
of
emotion
and
enthusiasm
realizing
after
the
mood
was
gone
that
they
had
been
watching
her
berenice
had
continued
the
pose
for
a
moment
then
had
waked
as
from
a
dream
with
a
sigh
this
incident
now
came
back
to
her
as
well
as
her
feeling
in
regard
to
the
opera
generally
it
is
very
beautiful
she
said
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
people
are
like
that
of
course
it
is
so
much
better
than
just
dull
comfort
life
is
really
finest
when
it
tragic
anyhow
she
looked
at
cowperwood
who
was
studying
her
then
at
braxmar
who
saw
himself
for
the
moment
on
the
captain
bridge
of
a
commanding
in
time
of
action
to
cowperwood
came
back
many
of
his
principal
moments
of
difficulty
surely
his
life
had
been
sufficiently
dramatic
to
satisfy
her
i
do
think
i
care
so
much
for
it
interposed
carter
one
gets
tired
of
sad
happenings
we
have
enough
drama
in
real
life
cowperwood
and
braxmar
smiled
faintly
berenice
looked
contemplatively
away
the
crush
of
diners
the
clink
of
china
and
glass
the
bustling
to
and
fro
of
waiters
and
the
strumming
of
the
orchestra
diverted
her
somewhat
as
did
the
nods
and
smiles
of
some
entering
guests
who
recognized
braxmar
and
herself
but
not
cowperwood
suddenly
from
a
neighboring
door
opening
from
the
men
cafe
and
grill
there
appeared
the
figure
of
an
ostensibly
swagger
society
man
his
clothing
somewhat
awry
an
hanging
loosely
from
one
shoulder
a
dangling
in
one
hand
his
eyes
a
little
bloodshot
his
under
lip
protruding
slightly
and
defiantly
and
his
whole
visage
proclaiming
that
superior
and
malicious
aspect
which
the
drunken
rake
does
not
so
much
assume
as
achieve
he
looked
sullenly
uncertainly
about
then
perceiving
cowperwood
and
his
party
made
his
way
thither
in
the
fashion
of
one
not
quite
sound
after
his
cups
when
he
was
directly
opposite
cowperwood
table
the
cynosure
of
a
number
of
eyes
he
suddenly
paused
as
if
in
recognition
and
coming
over
laid
a
genial
and
yet
condescending
hand
on
carter
bare
shoulder
why
hello
hattie
he
called
leeringly
and
jeeringly
what
are
you
doing
down
here
in
new
york
you
have
given
up
your
business
in
louisville
have
you
eh
old
sport
say
lem
me
tell
you
something
i
have
had
a
single
decent
girl
since
you
left
not
one
if
you
open
a
house
down
here
let
me
know
will
you
he
bent
over
her
smirkingly
and
patronizingly
the
while
he
made
as
if
to
rummage
in
his
white
waistcoat
pocket
for
a
card
at
the
same
moment
cowperwood
and
braxmar
realizing
quite
clearly
the
import
of
his
words
were
on
their
feet
while
carter
was
pulling
and
struggling
back
from
the
stranger
braxmar
hand
he
being
the
nearest
was
on
him
and
the
head
waiter
and
two
assistants
had
appeared
what
is
the
trouble
here
what
has
he
done
they
demanded
meanwhile
the
intruder
leering
contentiously
at
them
all
was
exclaiming
in
very
audible
tones
take
your
hands
off
who
are
you
what
the
devil
have
you
got
to
do
with
this
do
you
think
i
know
what
i
about

me
do
you
hattie
that
hattie
starr
of
louisville
ask
her
she

one
of
the
swellest
ever
run
in
louisville
what
do
you
people
want
to
be
so
upset
about
i
know
what
i
doing
she
knows
me
he
not
only
protested
but
contested
and
with
some
vehemence
cowperwood
braxmar
and
the
waiters
forming
a
cordon
he
was
shoved
and
hustled
out
into
the
lobby
and
the
outer
entranceway
and
an
officer
was
called
this
man
should
be
arrested
cowperwood
protested
vigorously
when
the
latter
appeared
he
has
grossly
insulted
lady
guests
of
mine
he
is
drunk
and
disorderly
and
i
wish
to
make
that
charge
here
is
my
card
will
you
let
me
know
where
to
come
he
handed
it
over
while
braxmar
scrutinizing
the
stranger
with
military
care
added
i
should
like
to
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
if
you
were
drunk
i
would
if
you
are
a
gentleman
and
have
a
card
i
want
you
to
give
it
to
me
i
want
to
talk
to
you
later
he
leaned
over
and
presented
a
cold
hard
face
to
that
of
beales
chadsey
of
louisville
kentucky
tha
all
right
captain
leered
chadsey
mockingly

he
fumbled
and
protested
while
the
officer
stood
by
read
to
take
him
in
charge
not
finding
a
card
he
added
tha
all

i
could

not

in
a
million
many
the
night
i
spent
in
her
house
braxmar
was
quite
ready
to
lunge
at
him
had
not
the
officer
intervened
back
in
the
berenice
and
her
mother
were
sitting
the
latter
quite
flustered
pale
distrait
horribly
taken
aback
by
far
too
much
distressed
for
any
convincing
measure
of
deception
why
the
very
idea
she
was
saying
that
dreadful
man
how
terrible
i
never
saw
him
before
in
my
life
berenice
disturbed
and
nonplussed
was
thinking
of
the
familiar
and
lecherous
leer
with
which
the
stranger
had
addressed
her
mother
the
horror
the
shame
of
it
could
even
a
drunken
man
if
utterly
mistaken
be
so
defiant
so
persistent
so
willing
to
explain
what
shameful
things
had
she
been
hearing
come
mother
she
said
gently
and
with
dignity
never
mind
it
is
all
right
we
can
go
home
at
once
you
will
feel
better
when
you
are
out
of
here
she
called
a
waiter
and
asked
him
to
say
to
the
gentlemen
that
they
had
gone
to
the
women
she
pushed
an
intervening
chair
out
of
the
way
and
gave
her
mother
her
arm
to
think
i
should
be
so
insulted
carter
mumbled
on
here
in
a
great
hotel
in
the
presence
of
lieutenant
braxmar
and
cowperwood
this
is
too
dreadful
well
i
never
she
half
whimpered
as
she
walked
and
berenice
surveying
the
room
with
dignity
a
lofty
superiority
in
her
face
led
solemnly
forth
a
strange
lacerating
pain
about
her
heart
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
these
shameful
statements
why
should
this
drunken
roisterer
have
selected
her
mother
of
all
other
women
in
the
for
the
object
of
these
outrageous
remarks
why
should
her
mother
be
stricken
so
utterly
collapsed
if
there
were
not
some
truth
in
what
he
had
said
it
was
very
strange
very
sad
very
grim
very
horrible
what
would
that
gossiping
world
of
which
she
knew
so
much
say
to
a
scene
like
this
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
import
and
horror
of
social
ostracism
flashed
upon
her
the
following
morning
owing
to
a
visit
paid
to
the
jefferson
market
police
court
by
lieutenant
braxmar
where
he
proposed
if
satisfaction
were
not
immediately
guaranteed
to
empty
cold
lead
into
beales
chadsey
stomach
the
following
letter
on
buckingham
stationery
was
written
and
sent
to
ira
george
carter
central
park
south
dear
madam
last
evening
owing
to
a
drunken
debauch
for
which
i
have
no
satisfactory
or
suitable
explanation
to
make
i
was
the
unfortunate
occasion
of
an
outrage
upon
your
feelings
and
those
of
your
daughter
and
friends
for
which
i
wish
most
humbly
to
apologize
i
can
not
tell
you
how
sincerely
i
regret
whatever
i
said
or
did
which
i
can
not
now
clearly
recall
my
mental
attitude
when
drinking
is
both
contentious
and
malicious
and
while
in
this
mood
and
state
i
was
the
author
of
statements
which
i
know
to
be
wholly
unfounded
in
my
drunken
stupor
i
mistook
you
for
a
certain
notorious
woman
of
louisville
why
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
for
this
wholly
shameful
and
outrageous
conduct
i
sincerely
ask
your
pardon
beg
your
forgiveness
i
do
not
know
what
amends
i
can
make
but
anything
you
may
wish
to
suggest
i
shall
gladly
do
in
the
mean
while
i
hope
you
will
accept
this
letter
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
written
and
as
a
slight
attempt
at
recompense
which
i
know
can
never
fully
be
made
very
sincerely
beales
chadsey
at
the
same
time
lieutenant
braxmar
was
fully
aware
before
this
letter
was
written
or
sent
that
the
charges
implied
against
carter
were
only
too
well
founded
beales
chadsey
had
said
drunk
what
twenty
men
in
all
sobriety
and
even
the
police
at
louisville
would
corroborate
chadsey
had
insisted
on
making
this
clear
to
braxmar
before
writing
the
letter
chapter
lii
behind
the
arras
berenice
perusing
the
apology
from
beales
chadsey
which
her
mother
very
much
fagged
and
weary
handed
her
the
next
morning
thought
that
it
read
like
the
overnight
gallantry
of
some
one
who
was
seeking
to
make
amends
without
changing
his
point
of
view
carter
was
too
obviously
she
protested
too
much
berenice
knew
that
she
could
find
out
for
herself
if
she
chose
but
would
she
choose
the
thought
sickened
her
and
yet
who
was
she
to
judge
too
severely
cowperwood
came
in
bright
and
early
to
put
as
good
a
face
on
the
matter
as
he
could
he
explained
how
he
and
braxmar
had
gone
to
the
police
station
to
make
a
charge
how
chadsey
sobered
by
arrest
had
abandoned
his
bravado
and
humbly
apologized
when
viewing
the
letter
handed
him
by
carter
he
exclaimed
oh
yes
he
was
very
glad
to
promise
to
write
that
if
we
would
let
him
off
braxmar
seemed
to
think
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
i
wanted
the
judge
to
impose
a
fine
and
let
it
go
at
that
he
was
drunk
and
that
all
there
was
to
it
he
assumed
a
very
unknowing
air
when
in
the
presence
of
berenice
and
her
mother
but
when
alone
with
the
latter
his
manner
changed
completely
brazen
it
out
he
commanded
it
does
amount
to
anything
braxmar
does
believe
that
this
man
really
knows
anything
this
letter
is
enough
to
convince
berenice
put
a
good
face
on
it
more
depends
on
your
manner
than
on
anything
else
you
much
too
upset
that
do
at
all
you
tell
the
whole
story
that
way
at
the
same
time
he
privately
regarded
this
incident
as
a
fine
windfall
of
chance
in
all
likelihood
the
one
thing
which
would
serve
to
scare
the
lieutenant
away
outwardly
however
he
demanded
effrontery
assumption
and
carter
was
somewhat
cheered
but
when
she
was
alone
she
cried
berenice
coming
upon
her
accidentally
and
finding
her
eyes
wet
exclaimed
oh
mother
please
do
be
foolish
how
can
you
act
this
way
we
had
better
go
up
in
the
country
and
rest
a
little
while
if
you
are
so
unstrung
carter
protested
that
it
was
merely
nervous
reaction
but
to
berenice
it
seemed
that
where
there
was
so
much
smoke
there
must
be
some
fire
her
manner
in
the
aftermath
toward
braxmar
was
gracious
but
remote
he
called
the
next
day
to
say
how
sorry
he
was
and
to
ask
her
to
a
new
diversion
she
was
sweet
but
distant
in
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
was
plain
that
the
beales
chadsey
incident
was
closed
but
she
did
not
accept
his
invitation
mother
and
i
are
planning
to
go
to
the
country
for
a
few
days
she
observed
genially
i
ca
say
just
when
we
shall
return
but
if
you
are
still
here
we
shall
meet
no
doubt
you
must
be
sure
and
come
to
see
us
she
turned
to
an
east
where
the
morning
sun
was
gleaming
on
some
flowers
in
a
and
began
to
pinch
off
a
dead
leaf
here
and
there
braxmar
full
of
the
tradition
of
american
romance
captivated
by
her
vibrant
charm
her
poise
and
superiority
under
the
circumstances
her
obvious
readiness
to
dismiss
him
was
overcome
as
the
human
mind
frequently
is
by
a
riddle
of
the
spirit
a
chemical
reaction
as
mysterious
to
its
victim
as
to
one
who
is
its
witness
stepping
forward
with
a
motion
that
was
at
once
gallant
reverent
eager
unconscious
he
exclaimed
berenice
miss
fleming
please
do
send
me
away
like
this
leave
me
it
is
anything
i
have
done
is
it
i
am
mad
about
you
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
anything
that
has
happened
could
make
any
difference
between
you
and
me
i
have
had
the
courage
to
tell
you
before
but
i
want
to
tell
you
now
i
have
been
in
love
with
you
from
the
very
first
night
i
saw
you
you
are
such
a
wonderful
girl
i
feel
that
i
deserve
you
but
i
love
you
i
love
you
with
all
the
honor
and
force
in
me
i
admire
and
respect
you
whatever
may
or
may
not
be
true
it
is
all
one
and
the
same
to
me
be
my
wife
will
you
marry
me
please
oh
i
not
fit
to
be
the
lacer
of
your
shoes
but
i
have
position
and
i
make
a
name
for
myself
i
hope
oh
berenice
he
extended
his
arms
in
a
dramatic
fashion
not
outward
but
downward
stiff
and
straight
and
declared
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
you
is
there
no
hope
for
me
at
all
an
artist
in
all
the
graces
of
sex
histrionic
plastic
berenice
debated
for
the
fraction
of
a
minute
what
she
should
do
and
say
she
did
not
love
the
lieutenant
as
he
loved
her
by
any
means
and
somehow
this
discovery
concerning
her
mother
shamed
her
pride
suggesting
an
obligation
to
save
herself
in
one
form
or
another
which
she
resented
bitterly
she
was
sorry
for
his
tactless
proposal
at
this
time
although
she
knew
well
enough
the
innocence
and
virtue
of
the
emotion
from
which
it
sprung
really
braxmar
she
replied
turning
on
him
with
solemn
eyes
you
must
ask
me
to
decide
that
now
i
know
how
you
feel
afraid
though
that
i
may
have
been
a
little
misleading
in
my
manner
i
did
mean
to
be
i
quite
sure
you
better
forget
your
interest
in
me
for
the
present
anyhow
i
could
only
make
up
my
mind
in
one
way
if
you
should
insist
i
should
have
to
ask
you
to
forget
me
entirely
i
wonder
if
you
can
see
how
i
feel
how
it
hurts
me
to
say
this
she
paused
perfectly
poised
yet
quite
moved
really
as
charming
a
figure
as
one
would
have
wished
to
see
part
greek
part
oriental
contemplative
calculating
in
that
moment
for
the
first
time
braxmar
realized
that
he
was
talking
to
some
one
whom
he
could
not
comprehend
really
she
was
strangely
enigmatic
more
beautiful
perhaps
because
more
remote
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
before
in
a
strange
flash
this
young
american
saw
the
isles
of
greece
cytherea
the
lost
atlantis
cyprus
and
its
paphian
shrine
his
eyes
burned
with
a
strange
comprehending
luster
his
color
at
first
high
went
pale
i
ca
believe
you
do
care
for
me
at
all
miss
berenice
he
went
on
quite
strainedly
i
felt
you
did
care
about
me
but
here
he
added
all
at
once
with
a
real
if
summoned
military
force
i
bother
you
you
do
understand
me
you
know
how
i
feel
i
change
ca
we
be
friends
anyhow
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
took
it
feeling
now
that
she
was
putting
an
end
to
what
might
have
been
an
idyllic
romance
of
course
we
can
she
said
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
again
soon
after
he
was
gone
she
walked
into
the
adjoining
room
and
sat
down
in
a
wicker
chair
putting
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
resting
her
chin
in
her
hands
what
a
denouement
to
a
thing
so
innocent
so
charming
and
now
he
was
gone
she
would
not
see
him
any
more
would
not
want
to
see
him
not
much
anyhow
life
had
sad
even
ugly
facts
oh
yes
yes
and
she
was
beginning
to
perceive
them
clearly
some
two
days
later
when
berenice
had
brooded
and
brooded
until
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
she
finally
went
to
carter
and
said
mother
why
do
you
tell
me
all
about
this
louisville
matter
so
that
i
may
really
know
i
can
see
something
is
worrying
you
ca
you
trust
me
i
am
no
longer
a
child
by
any
means
and
i
am
your
daughter
it
may
help
me
to
straighten
things
out
to
know
what
to
do
carter
who
had
always
played
a
game
of
lofty
though
loving
motherhood
was
greatly
taken
aback
by
this
courageous
attitude
she
flushed
and
chilled
a
little
then
decided
to
lie
i
tell
you
there
was
nothing
at
all
she
declared
nervously
and
pettishly
it
is
all
an
awful
mistake
i
wish
that
dreadful
man
could
be
punished
severely
for
what
he
said
to
me
to
be
outraged
and
insulted
this
way
before
my
own
child
mother
questioned
berenice
fixing
her
with
those
cool
blue
eyes
why
do
you
tell
me
all
about
louisville
you
and
i
should
have
things
between
us
maybe
i
can
help
you
all
at
once
carter
realizing
that
her
daughter
was
no
longer
a
child
nor
a
mere
social
butterfly
but
a
woman
superior
cool
sympathetic
with
intuitions
much
deeper
than
her
own
sank
into
a
heavily
flowered
behind
her
and
seeking
a
small
with
one
hand
placed
the
other
over
her
eyes
and
began
to
cry
i
was
so
driven
bevy
i
did
know
which
way
to
turn
colonel
gillis
suggested
it
i
wanted
to
keep
you
and
rolfe
in
school
and
give
you
a
chance
it
is
true
anything
that
horrible
man
said
it
was
anything
like
what
he
suggested
colonel
gillis
and
several
others
wanted
me
to
rent
them
bachelor
quarters
and
that
the
way
it
all
came
about
it
was
my
fault
i
could
help
myself
bevy
and
what
about
mr
cowperwood
inquired
berenice
curiously
she
had
begun
of
late
to
think
a
great
deal
about
cowperwood
he
was
so
cool
deep
dynamic
in
a
way
resourceful
like
herself
there
nothing
about
him
replied
carter
looking
up
defensively
of
all
her
men
friends
she
best
liked
cowperwood
he
had
never
advised
her
to
evil
ways
or
used
her
house
as
a
convenience
to
himself
alone
he
never
did
anything
but
help
me
out
he
advised
me
to
give
up
my
house
in
louisville
and
come
east
and
devote
myself
to
looking
after
you
and
rolfe
he
offered
to
help
me
until
you
two
should
be
able
to
help
yourselves
and
so
i
came
oh
if
i
had
only
not
been
so
foolish
so
afraid
of
life
but
your
father
and
carter
just
ran
through
everything
she
heaved
a
deep
heartfelt
sigh
then
we
really
have
anything
at
all
have
we
mother
property
or
anything
else
carter
shook
her
head
meaning
no
and
the
money
we
have
been
spending
is
mr
cowperwood
yes
berenice
paused
and
looked
out
the
window
over
the
wide
stretch
of
park
which
it
commanded
framed
in
it
like
a
picture
were
a
small
lake
a
hill
of
trees
with
a
japanese
pagoda
effect
in
the
foreground
over
the
hill
were
the
yellow
towering
walls
of
a
great
hotel
in
central
park
west
in
the
street
below
could
be
heard
the
jingle
of
on
a
road
in
the
park
could
be
seen
a
moving
line
of
pleasure
vehicles
society
taking
an
airing
in
the
chill
november
afternoon
poverty
ostracism
she
thought
and
should
she
marry
rich
of
course
if
she
could
and
whom
should
she
marry
the
lieutenant
never
he
was
really
not
masterful
enough
mentally
and
he
had
witnessed
her
discomfiture
and
who
then
oh
the
long
line
of
sillies
rakes
who
combined
with
sober
prosperous
conventional
oofs
constituted
society
here
and
there
at
far
jumps
was
a
real
man
but
would
he
be
interested
in
her
if
he
knew
the
whole
truth
about
her
have
you
broken
with
mr
braxmar
asked
her
mother
curiously
nervously
hopefully
hopelessly
i
have
seen
him
since
replied
berenice
lying
conservatively
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
or
not
i
want
to
think
she
arose
but
do
you
mind
mother
only
i
wish
we
had
some
other
way
of
living
besides
being
dependent
on
mr
cowperwood
she
walked
into
her
boudoir
and
before
her
mirror
began
to
dress
for
a
dinner
to
which
she
had
been
invited
so
it
was
cowperwood
money
that
had
been
sustaining
them
all
during
the
last
few
years
and
she
had
been
so
liberal
with
his
means
so
proud
vain
boastful
superior
and
he
had
only
fixed
her
with
those
inquiring
examining
eyes
why
but
she
did
not
need
to
ask
herself
why
she
knew
now
what
a
game
he
had
been
playing
and
what
a
silly
she
had
been
not
to
see
it
did
her
mother
in
any
way
suspect
she
doubted
it
this
queer
paradoxical
impossible
world
the
eyes
of
cowperwood
burned
at
her
as
she
thought
chapter
liii
a
declaration
of
love
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
berenice
now
pondered
seriously
what
she
could
do
she
thought
of
marriage
but
decided
that
instead
of
sending
for
braxmar
or
taking
up
some
sickening
chase
of
an
individual
even
less
satisfactory
it
might
be
advisable
to
announce
in
a
simple
social
way
to
her
friends
that
her
mother
had
lost
her
money
and
that
she
herself
was
now
compelled
to
take
up
some
form
of
employment
the
teaching
of
dancing
perhaps
or
the
practice
of
it
professionally
she
suggested
this
calmly
to
her
mother
one
day
carter
who
had
been
long
a
parasite
really
without
any
constructive
monetary
notions
of
real
import
was
terrified
to
think
that
she
and
bevy
her
wonderful
daughter
and
by
reaction
her
son
should
come
to
anything
so
humdrum
and
prosaic
as
ordinary
struggling
life
and
after
all
her
dreams
she
sighed
and
cried
in
secret
writing
cowperwood
a
cautious
explanation
and
asking
him
to
see
her
privately
in
new
york
when
he
returned
do
you
think
we
had
best
go
on
a
little
while
longer
she
suggested
to
berenice
it
just
wrings
my
heart
to
think
that
you
with
your
qualifications
should
have
to
stoop
to
giving
we
had
better
do
almost
anything
for
a
while
yet
you
can
make
a
suitable
marriage
and
then
everything
will
be
all
right
for
you
it
does
matter
about
me
i
can
live
but
you
carter
strained
eyes
indicated
the
misery
she
felt
berenice
was
moved
by
this
affection
for
her
which
she
knew
to
be
genuine
but
what
a
fool
her
mother
had
been
what
a
weak
reed
indeed
she
was
to
lean
upon
cowperwood
when
he
conferred
with
carter
insisted
that
berenice
was
quixotic
nervously
awry
to
wish
to
modify
her
state
to
eschew
society
and
invalidate
her
wondrous
charm
by
any
sort
of
professional
life
by
prearrangement
with
carter
he
hurried
to
pocono
at
a
time
when
he
knew
that
berenice
was
there
alone
ever
since
the
beales
chadsey
incident
she
had
been
evading
him
when
he
arrived
as
he
did
about
one
in
the
afternoon
of
a
crisp
january
day
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
and
the
surrounding
landscape
was
bathed
in
a
crystalline
light
that
gave
back
to
the
eye
endless
facets
of
luster
jewel
beams
that
cut
space
with
a
flash
the
automobile
had
been
introduced
by
now
and
he
rode
in
a
of
eighty
that
gave
back
from
its
varnished
surface
a
lacquered
light
in
a
great
fur
coat
and
cap
of
round
black
he
arrived
at
the
door
well
bevy
he
exclaimed
pretending
not
to
know
of
absence
how
are
you
how
your
mother
is
she
in
berenice
fixed
him
with
her
cool
eyes
as
frank
and
incisive
as
they
were
daring
and
smiled
him
an
equivocal
welcome
she
wore
a
blue
denim
painter
apron
and
a
palette
of
many
colors
glistened
under
her
thumb
she
was
painting
and
thinking
thinking
being
her
special
occupation
these
days
and
her
thoughts
had
been
of
braxmar
cowperwood
kilmer
duelma
a
others
as
well
as
of
the
stage
dancing
painting
her
life
was
in
a
as
it
were
before
her
again
it
was
like
a
disarranged
puzzle
the
pieces
of
which
might
be
fitted
together
into
some
interesting
picture
if
she
could
but
endure
do
come
in
she
said
it
cold
is
it
well
there
a
nice
fire
here
for
you
no
mother
is
here
she
went
down
to
new
york
i
should
think
you
might
have
found
her
at
the
apartment
are
you
in
new
york
for
long
she
was
gay
cheerful
genial
but
remote
cowperwood
felt
the
protective
gap
that
lay
between
him
and
her
it
had
always
been
there
he
felt
that
even
though
she
might
understand
and
like
him
yet
there
was
something
convention
ambition
or
some
deficiency
on
his
part
that
was
keeping
her
from
him
keeping
her
eternally
distant
he
looked
about
the
room
at
the
picture
she
was
attempting
a
of
a
view
down
a
slope
at
the
view
itself
which
he
contemplated
from
the
window
at
some
dancing
sketches
she
had
recently
executed
and
hung
on
the
wall
for
the
time
being
lovely
short
tunic
motives
he
looked
at
her
in
her
interesting
and
becoming
apron
well
berenice
he
said
always
the
artist
first
it
is
your
world
you
will
never
escape
it
these
things
are
beautiful
he
waved
an
ungloved
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
choric
line
it
your
mother
i
came
to
see
anyhow
it
is
you
i
had
such
a
curious
letter
from
her
she
tells
me
you
want
to
give
up
society
and
take
to
teaching
or
something
of
that
sort
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
do
you
think
you
are
acting
rather
hastily
he
spoke
now
as
though
there
were
some
reason
entirely
disassociated
from
himself
that
was
impelling
him
to
this
interest
in
her
berenice
brush
in
hand
standing
by
her
picture
gave
him
a
look
that
was
cool
curious
defiant
equivocal
no
i
do
think
so
she
replied
quietly
you
know
how
things
have
been
so
i
may
speak
quite
frankly
i
know
that
intentions
were
always
of
the
best
her
mouth
moved
with
the
faintest
touch
of
sadness
her
heart
i
am
afraid
is
better
than
her
head
as
for
your
motives
i
am
satisfied
to
believe
that
they
have
been
of
the
best
also
i
know
that
they
have
been
in
fact
it
would
be
ungenerous
of
me
to
suggest
anything
else
cowperwood
fixed
eyes
it
seemed
to
her
had
moved
somewhere
in
their
deepest
depths
yet
i
do
feel
we
can
go
on
as
we
have
been
doing
we
have
no
money
of
our
own
why
should
i
do
something
what
else
can
i
really
do
she
paused
and
cowperwood
gazed
at
her
quite
still
in
her
informal
bunchy
painter
apron
and
with
her
blue
eyes
looking
out
at
him
from
beneath
her
loose
red
hair
it
seemed
to
him
she
was
the
most
perfect
thing
he
had
ever
known
such
a
keen
fixed
enthroned
mind
she
was
so
capable
so
splendid
and
like
his
own
her
eyes
were
unafraid
her
spiritual
equipoise
was
undisturbed
berenice
he
said
quietly
let
me
tell
you
something
you
did
me
the
honor
just
now
to
speak
of
my
motives
ingiving
your
mother
money
as
of
the
best
they
were
from
my
own
point
of
view
the
best
i
have
ever
known
i
will
not
say
what
i
thought
they
were
in
the
beginning
i
know
what
they
were
now
i
am
going
to
speak
quite
frankly
with
you
if
you
will
let
me
as
long
as
we
are
here
together
i
do
know
whether
you
know
this
or
not
but
when
i
first
met
your
mother
i
only
knew
by
chance
that
she
had
a
daughter
and
it
was
of
no
particular
interest
to
me
then
i
went
to
her
house
as
the
guest
of
a
financial
friend
of
mine
who
admired
her
greatly
from
the
first
i
myself
admired
her
because
i
found
her
to
be
a
lady
to
the
manner
born
she
was
interesting
one
day
i
happened
to
see
a
photograph
of
you
in
her
home
and
before
i
could
mention
it
she
put
it
away
perhaps
you
recall
the
one
it
is
in
profile
taken
when
you
were
about
sixteen
yes
i
remember
replied
berenice
simply
as
quietly
as
though
she
were
hearing
a
confession
well
that
picture
interested
me
intensely
i
inquired
about
you
and
learned
all
i
could
after
that
i
saw
another
picture
of
you
enlarged
in
a
louisville
photographer
window
i
bought
it
it
is
in
my
office
now
my
private
office
in
chicago
you
are
standing
by
a
mantelpiece
i
remember
replied
berenice
moved
but
uncertain
let
me
tell
you
a
little
something
about
my
life
will
you
it
take
long
i
was
born
in
philadelphia
my
family
had
always
belonged
there
i
have
been
in
the
banking
and
business
all
my
life
my
first
wife
was
a
presbyterian
girl
religious
conventional
she
was
older
than
i
by
six
or
seven
years
i
was
happy
for
a
while
five
or
six
years
we
had
two
children
both
still
living
then
i
met
my
present
wife
she
was
younger
than
myself
at
least
ten
years
and
very
she
was
in
some
respects
more
intelligent
than
my
first
wife
at
least
less
conventional
more
generous
i
thought
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
when
i
eventually
left
philadelphia
i
got
a
divorce
and
married
her
i
was
greatly
in
love
with
her
at
the
time
i
thought
she
was
an
ideal
mate
for
me
and
i
still
think
she
has
many
qualities
which
make
her
attractive
but
my
own
ideals
in
regard
to
women
have
all
the
time
been
slowly
changing
i
have
come
to
see
through
various
experiments
that
she
is
not
the
ideal
woman
for
me
at
all
she
does
not
understand
me
i
pretend
to
understand
myself
but
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
woman
somewhere
who
would
understand
me
better
than
i
understand
myself
who
would
see
the
things
that
i
do
see
about
myself
and
would
like
me
anyhow
i
might
as
well
tell
you
that
i
have
been
a
lover
of
women
always
there
is
just
one
ideal
thing
in
this
world
to
me
and
that
is
the
woman
that
i
would
like
to
have
i
should
think
it
would
make
it
rather
difficult
for
any
one
woman
to
discover
just
which
woman
you
would
like
to
have
smiled
berenice
whimsically
cowperwood
was
unabashed
it
would
i
presume
unless
she
should
chance
to
be
the
very
one
woman
i
am
talking
about
he
replied
impressively
i
should
think
she
would
have
her
work
cut
out
for
her
under
any
circumstances
added
berenice
lightly
but
with
a
touch
of
sympathy
in
her
voice
i
am
making
a
confession
replied
cowperwood
seriously
and
a
little
heavily
i
am
not
apologizing
for
myself
the
women
i
have
known
would
make
ideal
wives
for
some
men
but
not
for
me
life
has
taught
me
that
much
it
has
changed
me
and
do
you
think
the
process
has
stopped
by
any
means
she
replied
quaintly
with
that
air
of
superior
banter
which
puzzled
fascinated
defied
him
no
i
will
not
say
that
my
ideal
has
become
fixed
though
apparently
i
have
had
it
for
a
number
of
years
now
it
spoils
other
matters
for
me
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
ideal
we
do
have
a
in
physics
as
he
said
this
cowperwood
realized
that
for
him
he
was
making
a
very
remarkable
confession
he
had
come
here
primarily
to
magnetize
her
and
control
her
judgment
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
almost
the
other
way
about
she
was
almost
dominating
him
lithe
slender
resourceful
histrionic
she
was
standing
before
him
making
him
explain
himself
only
he
did
not
see
her
so
much
in
that
light
as
in
the
way
of
a
large
kindly
mothering
intelligence
which
could
see
feel
and
understand
she
would
know
how
it
was
he
felt
sure
he
could
make
himself
understood
if
he
tried
whatever
he
was
or
had
been
she
would
not
take
a
petty
view
she
could
not
her
answers
thus
far
guaranteed
as
much
yes
she
replied
we
do
have
a
but
you
do
not
seem
able
to
find
it
do
you
expect
to
find
your
ideal
in
any
living
woman
i
have
found
it
he
answered
wondering
at
the
ingenuity
and
complexity
of
her
mind
and
of
his
own
for
that
matter
of
all
mind
indeed
deep
below
deep
it
lay
staggering
him
at
times
by
its
fathomless
reaches
i
hope
you
will
take
seriously
what
i
am
going
to
say
for
it
will
explain
so
much
when
i
began
to
be
interested
in
your
picture
i
was
so
because
it
coincided
with
the
ideal
i
had
in
mind
the
thing
that
you
think
changes
swiftly
that
was
nearly
seven
years
ago
since
then
it
has
never
changed
when
i
saw
you
at
your
school
on
riverside
drive
i
was
fully
convinced
although
i
have
said
nothing
i
have
remained
so
perhaps
you
think
i
had
no
right
to
any
such
feelings
most
people
would
agree
with
you
i
had
them
and
do
have
them
just
the
same
and
it
explains
my
relation
to
your
mother
when
she
came
to
me
once
in
louisville
and
told
me
of
her
difficulties
i
was
glad
to
help
her
for
your
sake
that
has
been
my
reason
ever
since
although
she
does
not
know
that
in
some
respects
berenice
your
mother
is
a
little
dull
all
this
while
i
have
been
in
love
with
you
intensely
so
as
you
stand
there
now
you
seem
to
me
amazingly
beautiful
the
ideal
i
have
been
telling
you
about
do
be
disturbed
i
press
any
attentions
on
you
berenice
had
moved
very
slightly
she
was
concerned
as
much
for
him
as
for
herself
his
power
was
so
wide
his
power
so
great
she
could
not
help
taking
him
seriously
when
he
was
so
serious
i
have
done
whatever
i
have
done
in
connection
with
you
and
your
mother
because
i
have
been
in
love
with
you
and
because
i
wanted
you
to
become
the
splendid
thing
i
thought
you
ought
to
become
you
have
not
known
it
but
you
are
the
cause
of
my
building
the
house
on
fifth
avenue
the
principal
reason
i
wanted
to
build
something
worthy
of
you
a
dream
certainly
everything
we
do
seems
to
have
something
of
that
quality
its
beauty
if
there
is
any
is
due
to
you
i
made
it
beautiful
thinking
of
you
he
paused
and
berenice
gave
no
sign
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
object
but
her
vanity
her
love
of
art
her
love
of
power
all
were
touched
at
the
same
time
she
was
curious
now
as
to
whether
he
had
merely
expected
to
take
her
as
his
mistress
or
to
wait
until
he
could
honor
her
as
his
wife
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
whether
i
ever
expected
to
marry
you
or
not
he
went
on
getting
the
thought
out
of
her
mind
i
am
no
different
from
many
men
in
that
respect
berenice
i
will
be
frank
i
wanted
you
in
any
way
that
i
could
get
you
i
was
living
in
the
hope
all
along
that
you
would
fall
in
love
with
me
as
i
had
with
you
i
hated
braxmar
here
not
long
ago
when
he
appeared
on
the
scene
but
i
could
never
have
thought
of
interfering
i
was
quite
prepared
to
give
you
up
i
have
envied
every
man
i
have
ever
seen
with
you
young
and
old
i
have
even
envied
your
mother
for
being
so
close
to
you
when
i
could
not
be
at
the
same
time
i
have
wanted
you
to
have
everything
that
would
help
you
in
any
way
i
did
not
want
to
interfere
with
you
in
case
you
found
some
one
whom
you
could
truly
love
if
i
knew
that
you
could
not
love
me
there
is
the
whole
story
outside
of
anything
you
may
know
but
it
is
not
because
of
this
that
i
came
not
to
tell
you
this
he
paused
as
if
expecting
her
to
say
something
though
she
made
no
comment
beyond
a
questioning
yes
the
thing
that
i
have
come
to
say
is
that
i
want
you
to
go
on
as
you
were
before
whatever
you
may
think
of
me
or
of
what
i
have
just
told
you
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
am
sincere
and
disinterested
in
what
i
am
telling
you
now
my
dream
in
connection
with
you
is
not
quite
over
chance
might
make
me
eligible
if
you
should
happen
to
care
but
i
want
you
to
go
on
and
be
happy
regardless
of
me
i
have
dreamed
but
i
dare
say
it
has
been
a
mistake
hold
your
head
high
you
have
a
right
to
be
a
lady
marry
any
one
you
really
love
i
will
see
that
you
have
a
suitable
marriage
portion
i
love
you
berenice
but
i
will
make
it
a
fatherly
affection
from
now
on
when
i
die
i
will
put
you
in
my
will
but
go
on
now
in
the
spirit
you
were
going
before
i
really
ca
be
happy
unless
i
think
you
are
going
to
be
he
paused
still
looking
at
her
believing
for
the
time
being
what
he
said
if
he
should
die
she
would
find
herself
in
his
will
if
she
were
to
go
on
and
socialize
and
seek
she
might
find
some
one
to
love
but
also
she
might
think
of
him
more
kindly
before
she
did
so
what
would
be
the
cost
of
her
as
a
ward
compared
to
his
satisfaction
and
delight
in
having
her
at
least
friendly
and
sympathetic
and
being
in
her
good
graces
and
confidence
berenice
who
had
always
been
more
or
less
interested
in
him
temperamentally
biased
indeed
in
his
direction
because
of
his
efficiency
simplicity
directness
and
force
was
especially
touched
in
this
instance
by
his
utter
frankness
and
generosity
she
might
question
his
temperamental
control
over
his
own
sincerity
in
the
future
but
she
could
scarcely
question
that
at
present
he
was
sincere
moreover
his
long
period
of
secret
love
and
admiration
the
thought
of
so
powerful
a
man
dreaming
of
her
in
this
fashion
was
so
flattering
it
soothed
her
troubled
vanity
and
shame
in
what
had
gone
before
his
straightforward
confession
had
a
kind
of
nobility
which
was
electric
moving
she
looked
at
him
as
he
stood
there
a
little
gray
about
the
temples
the
most
appealing
ornament
of
some
men
to
some
women
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
help
being
moved
by
a
kind
of
tenderness
sympathy
mothering
affection
obviously
he
did
need
the
woman
his
attitude
seemed
to
show
that
he
needed
some
woman
of
culture
spirit
taste
amorousness
or
at
least
he
was
entitled
to
dream
of
her
as
he
stood
before
her
he
seemed
a
kind
of
superman
and
yet
also
a
bad
boy
handsome
powerful
hopeful
not
so
very
much
older
than
herself
now
impelled
by
some
blazing
internal
force
which
harried
him
on
and
on
how
much
did
he
really
care
for
her
how
much
could
he
how
much
could
he
care
for
any
one
yet
see
all
he
had
done
to
interest
her
what
did
that
mean
to
say
all
this
to
do
all
this
outside
was
his
car
brown
and
radiant
in
the
snow
he
was
the
great
frank
algernon
cowperwood
of
chicago
and
he
was
pleading
with
her
a
mere
chit
of
a
girl
to
be
kind
to
him
not
to
put
him
out
of
her
life
entirely
it
touched
her
intellect
her
pride
her
fancy
aloud
she
said
i
like
you
better
now
i
really
believe
in
you
i
never
did
quite
before
not
that
i
think
i
ought
to
let
you
spend
your
money
on
me
or
mother
i
do
but
i
admire
you
you
make
me
i
understand
how
it
is
i
think
i
know
what
your
ambitions
are
i
have
always
felt
that
i
did
in
part
but
you
must
talk
to
me
any
more
now
i
want
to
think
i
want
to
think
over
what
you
have
said
i
do
know
whether
i
can
bring
myself
to
it
or
not
she
noticed
that
his
eyes
seemed
to
move
somehow
in
their
deepest
depths
again
but
we
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
at
present
but
berenice
he
added
with
a
real
plea
in
his
voice
i
wonder
if
you
do
understand
i
have
been
so
lonely
i
am
yes
i
do
she
replied
holding
out
her
hand
we
are
going
to
be
friends
whatever
happens
from
now
on
because
i
really
like
you
you
must
ask
me
to
decide
about
the
other
though
i
ca
do
it
i
do
want
to
i
do
care
to
not
when
i
would
so
gladly
give
you
everything
when
i
need
it
so
little
not
until
i
think
it
out
for
myself
i
do
think
so
though
no
she
replied
with
an
air
there
mr
guardian
father
she
laughed
pushing
his
hand
away
cowperwood
heart
bounded
he
would
have
given
millions
to
take
her
close
in
his
arms
as
it
was
he
smiled
appealingly
do
you
want
to
jump
in
and
come
to
new
york
with
me
if
your
mother
is
at
the
apartment
you
could
stop
at
the
netherland
no
not
i
expect
to
be
in
soon
i
will
let
you
know
or
mother
will
he
bustled
out
and
into
the
machine
after
a
moment
of
parley
waving
to
her
over
the
purpling
snow
of
the
evening
as
his
machine
tore
eastward
planning
to
make
new
york
by
if
he
could
just
keep
her
in
this
friendly
sympathetic
attitude
if
he
only
could
chapter
liv
wanted
franchises
whatever
his
momentary
satisfaction
in
her
friendly
acceptance
of
his
confession
the
uncertain
attitude
of
berenice
left
cowperwood
about
where
he
was
before
by
a
strange
stroke
of
fate
braxmar
his
young
rival
had
been
eliminated
and
berenice
had
been
made
to
see
him
cowperwood
in
his
true
colors
of
love
and
of
service
for
her
yet
plainly
she
did
not
accept
them
at
his
own
valuation
more
than
ever
was
he
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
fallen
in
tow
of
an
amazing
individual
one
who
saw
life
from
a
distinct
and
peculiar
point
of
view
and
who
was
not
to
be
bent
to
his
will
that
fact
more
than
anything
else
for
her
grace
and
beauty
merely
emblazoned
it
caused
him
to
fall
into
a
hopeless
infatuation
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
well
i
can
live
without
her
if
i
must
but
at
this
stage
the
mere
thought
was
an
actual
stab
in
his
vitals
what
after
all
was
life
wealth
fame
if
you
could
have
the
woman
you
wanted
love
that
indefinable
unnamable
coddling
of
the
spirit
which
the
strongest
almost
more
than
the
weakest
crave
at
last
he
saw
clearly
as
within
a
nimbus
that
the
ultimate
end
of
fame
power
vigor
was
beauty
and
that
beauty
was
a
compound
of
the
taste
the
emotion
the
innate
culture
passion
and
dreams
of
a
woman
like
berenice
fleming
that
was
it
that
was
it
and
beyond
was
nothing
save
crumbling
age
darkness
silence
in
the
mean
time
owing
to
the
preliminary
activity
and
tact
of
his
agents
and
advisers
the
sunday
newspapers
were
vying
with
one
another
in
describing
the
wonders
of
his
new
house
in
new
york
its
cost
the
value
of
its
ground
the
wealthy
citizens
with
whom
the
cowperwoods
would
now
be
neighbors
there
were
pictures
of
aileen
and
cowperwood
with
articles
indicating
them
as
prospective
entertainers
on
a
grand
scale
who
would
unquestionably
be
received
because
of
their
tremendous
wealth
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
purely
newspaper
gossip
and
speculation
while
the
general
columns
made
news
and
capital
of
his
wealth
special
society
columns
which
dealt
with
the
ignored
him
entirely
already
the
machination
of
certain
chicago
social
figures
in
distributing
information
as
to
his
past
was
discernible
in
the
attitude
of
those
clubs
organizations
and
even
churches
membership
in
which
constitutes
a
form
of
social
passport
to
better
and
higher
earthly
if
not
spiritual
realms
his
emissaries
were
active
enough
but
soon
found
that
their
end
was
not
to
be
gained
in
a
day
many
were
waiting
locally
anxious
enough
to
get
in
and
with
social
equipments
which
the
cowperwoods
could
scarcely
boast
after
being
blackballed
by
one
or
two
exclusive
clubs
seeing
his
application
for
a
pew
at
quietly
for
the
present
and
his
invitations
declined
by
several
multimillionaires
whom
he
met
in
the
course
of
commercial
transactions
he
began
to
feel
that
his
splendid
home
aside
from
its
final
purpose
as
an
could
be
of
little
value
at
the
same
time
cowperwood
financial
genius
was
constantly
being
rewarded
by
many
new
phases
of
materiality
chiefly
by
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
he
was
now
able
to
engineer
between
himself
and
the
house
of
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
co
seeing
the
iron
manner
in
which
he
had
managed
to
wrest
victory
out
of
defeat
after
the
first
seriously
contested
election
these
gentlemen
had
experienced
a
change
of
heart
and
announced
that
they
would
now
gladly
help
finance
any
new
enterprise
which
cowperwood
might
undertake
among
many
other
financiers
they
had
heard
of
his
triumph
in
connection
with
the
failure
of
american
match
dot
must
be
a
right
cleffer
man
dot
cowperwood
gotloeb
told
several
of
his
partners
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
i
shouldt
like
to
meet
him
and
so
cowperwood
was
manoeuvered
into
the
giant
banking
office
where
gotloeb
extended
a
genial
hand

the
great
external
element
in
cowperwood
financial
success
and
one
which
he
himself
had
foreseen
from
the
very
beginning
was
the
fact
that
chicago
was
developing
constantly
what
had
been
when
he
arrived
a
soggy
messy
plain
strewn
with
shanties
ragged
sidewalks
a
business
heart
was
now
truly
an
astounding
metropolis
which
had
passed
the
million
mark
in
population
and
which
stretched
proud
and
strong
over
the
greater
part
of
cook
county
where
once
had
been
a
meager
makeshift
financial
section
with
here
and
there
only
a
splendid
business
building
or
hotel
or
a
public
office
of
some
kind
there
were
now
streets
lined
with
fifteen
and
even
eighteen
story
office
buildings
from
the
upper
stories
of
which
as
from
might
be
surveyed
the
vast
expanding
regions
of
simple
home
life
below
farther
out
were
districts
of
mansions
parks
pleasure
resorts
great
worlds
of
and
manufacturing
areas
in
the
commercial
heart
of
this
world
frank
algernon
cowperwood
had
truly
become
a
figure
of
giant
significance
how
wonderful
it
is
that
men
grow
until
like
colossi
they
bestride
the
world
or
like
they
drop
roots
from
every
branch
and
are
themselves
a
forest
a
forest
of
intricate
commercial
life
of
which
a
thousand
material
aspects
are
the
evidence
his
properties
were
like
a
net
the
parasite
gold
thread
linked
together
as
they
were
and
draining
two
of
the
three
important
sides
of
the
city
in
when
he
had
first
secured
a
foothold
they
had
been
capitalized
at
between
six
and
seven
millions
every
device
for
issuing
a
dollar
on
real
property
having
been
exhausted
under
his
management
they
were
capitalized
at
between
sixty
and
seventy
millions
the
majority
of
the
stock
issued
and
sold
was
subject
to
a
financial
device
whereby
twenty
per
cent
controlled
eighty
per
cowperwood
holding
that
twenty
per
cent
and
borrowing
money
on
it
as
hypothecated
collateral
in
the
case
of
the
west
side
corporation
a
corporate
issue
of
over
thirty
millions
had
been
made
and
these
stocks
owing
to
the
tremendous
carrying
power
of
the
roads
and
the
swelling
traffic
night
and
morning
of
poor
sheep
who
paid
their
nickels
had
a
market
value
which
gave
the
road
an
assured
physical
value
of
about
three
times
the
sum
for
which
it
could
have
been
built
the
north
chicago
company
which
in
had
a
physical
value
of
little
more
than
a
million
could
not
now
be
duplicated
for
less
than
seven
millions
and
was
capitalized
at
nearly
fifteen
millions
the
road
was
valued
at
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
more
per
mile
than
the
sum
for
which
it
could
actually
have
been
replaced
pity
the
poor
groveling
hack
at
the
bottom
who
has
not
the
either
to
understand
or
to
control
that
which
his
very
presence
and
necessities
create
these
tremendous
holdings
paying
from
ten
to
twelve
per
cent
on
every
share
were
in
the
control
if
not
in
the
actual
ownership
of
cowperwood
millions
in
loans
that
did
not
appear
on
the
books
of
the
companies
he
had
converted
into
actual
cash
wherewith
he
had
bought
houses
lands
equipages
paintings
government
bonds
of
the
purest
gold
value
thereby
assuring
himself
to
that
extent
of
a
fortune
vaulted
and
locked
absolutely
secure
after
much
toiling
and
moiling
on
the
part
of
his
overworked
legal
department
he
had
secured
a
consolidation
under
the
title
of
the
consolidated
traction
company
of
illinois
of
all
outlying
lines
each
having
separate
franchises
and
capitalized
separately
yet
operated
by
an
amazing
of
contracts
and
agreements
in
single
harmonious
union
with
all
his
other
properties
the
north
and
west
chicago
companies
he
now
proposed
to
unite
into
a
third
company
to
be
called
the
union
traction
company
by
taking
up
the
ten
and
twelve
per
cent
issues
of
the
old
north
and
west
companies
and
giving
two
for
one
of
the
new
union
traction
stocks
in
their
stead
he
could
satisfy
the
current
stockholders
who
were
apparently
made
somewhat
better
off
thereby
and
still
create
and
leave
for
himself
a
handsome
margin
of
nearly
eighty
million
dollars
with
a
renewal
of
his
franchises
for
twenty
fifty
or
one
hundred
years
he
would
have
fastened
on
the
city
of
chicago
the
burden
of
yielding
interest
on
this
somewhat
fictitious
value
and
would
leave
himself
personally
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
one
hundred
millions
this
matter
of
extending
his
franchises
was
a
most
difficult
and
intricate
business
however
it
involved
overcoming
or
outwitting
a
recent
and
very
treacherous
increase
of
local
sentiment
against
him
this
had
been
occasioned
by
various
details
which
related
to
his
elevated
roads
to
the
two
lines
already
built
he
now
added
a
third
property
the
union
loop
this
he
prepared
to
connect
not
only
with
his
own
but
with
other
outside
elevated
properties
chief
among
which
was
schryhart
south
side
he
would
then
farm
out
to
his
enemies
the
privilege
of
running
trains
on
this
new
line
however
unwillingly
they
would
be
forced
to
avail
themselves
of
the
proffered
opportunity
because
within
the
region
covered
by
the
new
loop
was
the
true
congestion
here
every
one
desired
to
come
either
once
or
twice
during
the
day
or
night
by
this
means
cowperwood
would
secure
to
his
property
a
paying
interest
from
the
start
this
scheme
aroused
a
really
unprecedented
antagonism
in
the
breasts
of
cowperwood
enemies
by
the
contingent
it
was
looked
upon
as
nothing
short
of
diabolical
the
newspapers
directed
by
such
men
as
haguenin
hyssop
ormonde
ricketts
and
truman
leslie
macdonald
whose
father
was
now
dead
and
whose
thoughts
as
editor
of
the
inquirer
were
almost
solely
directed
toward
driving
cowperwood
out
of
chicago
began
to
shout
as
a
last
resort
in
the
interests
of
democracy
seats
for
everybody

lines

to

twenty
per
cent
of
the
gross
income
of
his
lines
to
be
paid
to
the
city
the
masses
should
be
made
cognizant
of
their
individual
rights
and
privileges
such
a
course
while
decidedly
inimical
to
cowperwood
interests
at
the
present
time
and
as
such
strongly
favored
by
the
majority
of
his
opponents
had
nevertheless
its
disturbing
elements
to
an
like
hosmer
hand
i
do
know
about
this
norman
he
remarked
to
schryhart
on
one
occasion
i
do
know
about
this
it
one
thing
to
stir
up
the
public
but
it
another
to
make
them
forget
this
is
a
restless
socialistic
country
and
chicago
is
the
very
hotbed
and
center
of
it
still
if
it
will
serve
to
trip
him
up
i
suppose
it
will
do
for
the
present
the
newspapers
can
probably
smooth
it
all
over
later
but
i
do
know
hand
was
of
that
order
of
mind
that
sees
socialism
as
a
horrible
importation
of
europe
why
could
the
people
be
satisfied
to
allow
the
strong
intelligent
men
of
the
community
to
arrange
things
for
them
was
that
what
democracy
meant
certainly
it
was
he
himself
was
one
of
the
strong
he
could
not
help
distrusting
all
this
radical
palaver
still
anything
to
hurt
cowperwood
anything
cowperwood
was
not
slow
to
realize
that
public
sentiment
was
now
in
danger
of
being
thoroughly
crystallized
against
him
by
newspaper
agitation
although
his
franchises
would
not
expire
the
large
majority
of
them
before
january
yet
if
things
went
on
at
this
rate
it
would
be
doubtful
soon
whether
ever
again
he
would
be
able
to
win
another
election
by
methods
legitimate
or
illegitimate
hungry
aldermen
and
councilmen
might
be
venal
and
greedy
enough
to
do
anything
he
should
ask
provided
he
was
willing
to
pay
enough
but
even
the
the
most
voracious
and
corrupt
politician
could
scarcely
withstand
the
searching
glare
of
publicity
and
the
infuriated
rage
of
a
possibly
aroused
public
opinion
by
degrees
this
last
owing
to
the
untiring
efforts
of
the
newspapers
was
being
whipped
into
a
wild
foam
to
come
into
council
at
this
time
and
ask
for
a
extension
of
franchises
not
destined
to
expire
for
seven
years
was
too
much
it
could
not
be
done
even
suborned
councilmen
would
be
unwilling
to
undertake
it
just
now
there
are
some
things
which
even
politically
are
impossible
to
make
matters
worse
the
limit
was
really
not
at
all
sufficient
for
his
present
needs
in
order
to
bring
about
the
consolidation
of
his
north
and
west
surface
lines
which
he
was
now
proposing
and
on
the
strength
of
which
he
wished
to
issue
at
least
two
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
shares
in
place
of
the
seventy
million
dollars
current
of
ten
and
twelve
per
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
secure
a
much
more
respectable
term
of
years
than
the
brief
one
now
permitted
by
the
state
legislature
even
providing
that
this
latter
could
be
obtained
peeble
are
not
ferry
much
indrested
in
tees
frangizes
observed
gotloeb
once
when
cowperwood
was
talking
the
matter
over
with
him
he
wanted
haeckelheimer
to
underwrite
the
whole
issue
dey
are
so
insigure
now
if
you
couldt
get
say
a
frangize
for
fifty
or
one
hunnert
years
or
something
like
dot
your
stocks
wouldt
go
off
like
hot
cakes
i
know
where
i
couldt
dispose
of
fifty
million
dollars
off
dem
in
cermany
alone
he
was
most
unctuous
and
pleading
cowperwood
understood
this
quite
as
well
as
gotloeb
if
not
better
he
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
thought
of
obtaining
a
beggarly
extension
for
his
giant
schemes
when
cities
like
philadelphia
boston
new
york
and
pittsburg
were
apparently
glad
to
grant
their
corporations
franchises
which
would
not
expire
for
years
at
the
earliest
and
in
most
cases
were
given
in
perpetuity
this
was
the
kind
of
franchise
favored
by
the
great
moneyed
houses
of
new
york
and
europe
and
which
gotloeb
and
even
addison
locally
were
demanding
it
is
certainly
important
that
we
get
these
franchises
renewed
for
fifty
years
addison
used
to
say
to
him
and
it
was
seriously
and
disagreeably
true
the
various
lights
of
cowperwood
legal
department
constantly
on
the
search
for
new
legislative
devices
were
not
slow
to
grasp
the
import
of
the
situation
it
was
not
long
before
the
resourceful
joel
avery
appeared
with
a
suggestion
did
you
notice
what
the
state
legislature
of
new
york
is
doing
in
connection
with
the
various
local
transit
problems
down
there
asked
this
honorable
gentleman
of
cowperwood
one
morning
ambling
in
when
announced
and
seating
himself
in
the
great
presence
a
cigar
was
between
his
fingers
and
a
little
round
felt
hat
looked
peculiarly
rakish
above
his
sinister
intellectual
constructive
face
and
eyes
no
i
did
replied
cowperwood
who
had
actually
noted
and
pondered
upon
the
item
in
question
but
who
did
not
care
to
say
so
i
saw
something
about
it
but
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
it
what
of
it
well
it
plans
to
authorize
a
body
of
four
or
five
men
one
branch
in
new
york
one
in
buffalo
i
presume
to
grant
all
new
franchises
and
extend
old
ones
with
the
consent
of
the
various
local
communities
involved
they
are
to
fix
the
rate
of
compensation
to
be
paid
to
the
state
or
the
city
and
the
rates
of
fare
they
can
regulate
transfers
stock
issues
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
was
thinking
if
at
any
time
we
find
this
business
of
renewing
the
franchises
too
uncertain
here
we
might
go
into
the
state
legislature
and
see
what
can
be
done
about
introducing
a
commission
of
that
kind
into
this
state
we
are
not
the
only
corporation
that
would
welcome
it
of
course
it
would
be
better
if
there
were
a
general
or
special
demand
for
it
outside
of
ourselves
it
ought
not
to
originate
with
us
he
stared
at
cowperwood
heavily
the
latter
returning
a
reflective
gaze
i
think
it
over
he
said
there
may
be
something
in
that
henceforth
the
thought
of
instituting
such
a
commission
never
left
cowperwood
mind
it
contained
the
germ
of
a
solution
the
possibility
of
extending
his
franchises
for
fifty
or
even
a
hundred
years
this
plan
as
cowperwood
was
subsequently
to
discover
was
a
thing
more
or
less
expressly
forbidden
by
the
state
constitution
of
illinois
the
latter
provided
that
no
special
or
exclusive
privilege
immunity
or
franchise
whatsoever
should
be
granted
to
any
corporation
association
or
individual
yet
what
is
a
little
matter
like
the
constitution
between
friends
anyhow
some
one
had
already
asked
there
are
fads
in
legislation
as
well
as
dusty
pigeonholes
in
which
phases
of
older
law
are
tucked
away
and
forgotten
many
earlier
ideals
of
the
had
long
since
been
conveniently
obscured
or
nullified
by
decisions
appeals
to
the
federal
government
appeals
to
the
state
government
communal
contracts
and
the
like
fine
cobwebby
figments
all
but
sufficient
just
the
same
to
render
inoperative
the
original
intention
besides
cowperwood
had
but
small
respect
for
either
the
intelligence
or
the
capacity
of
such
men
as
constituted
the
rural
voting
element
of
the
state
from
his
lawyers
and
from
others
he
had
heard
innumerable
droll
stories
of
life
in
the
state
legislature
and
the
state
counties
and
towns
on
the
bench
at
the
rural
huskings
where
the
state
elections
were
won
in
country
hotels
on
country
roads
and
farms
one
day
as
i
was
getting
on
the
train
at
petunkey
old
general
van
sickle
or
judge
dickensheets
or
avery
would
begin
and
then
would
follow
some
amazing
narration
of
rural
immorality
or
dullness
or
political
or
social
misconception
of
the
total
population
of
the
state
at
this
time
over
half
were
in
the
city
itself
and
these
he
had
managed
to
keep
in
control
for
the
remaining
million
divided
between
twelve
small
cities
and
an
agricultural
population
he
had
small
respect
what
did
this
handful
of
yokels
amount
to
anyhow
dull
frivoling
boors
the
great
state
of
illinois
a
territory
as
large
as
england
proper
and
as
fertile
as
egypt
bordered
by
a
great
lake
and
a
vast
river
and
with
a
population
of
over
two
million
americans
would
scarcely
seem
a
fit
subject
for
corporate
manipulation
and
control
yet
a
more
commonwealth
might
not
have
been
found
anywhere
at
this
time
within
the
entire
length
and
breadth
of
the
universe
cowperwood
personally
though
contemptuous
of
the
bucolic
mass
when
regarded
as
individuals
had
always
been
impressed
by
this
great
community
of
his
election
here
had
come
marquette
and
joliet
la
salle
and
hennepin
dreaming
a
way
to
the
pacific
here
lincoln
and
douglas
antagonist
and
protagonist
of

argument
had
contested
here
had
arisen
joe
smith
propagator
of
that
strange
american
dogma
of
the
saints
what
a
state
cowperwood
sometimes
thought
what
a
figment
of
the
brain
and
yet
how
wonderful
he
had
crossed
it
often
on
his
way
to
louis
to
memphis
to
denver
and
had
been
touched
by
its
very
simplicity
the
small
new
wooden
towns
so
redolent
of
american
tradition
prejudice
force
and
illusion
the
church
the
village
streets
the
long
stretches
of
flat
open
country
where
corn
grew
in
serried
rows
or
where
in
winter
the
snow
bedded
lightly
it
all
reminded
him
a
little
of
his
own
father
and
mother
who
had
been
in
many
respects
suited
to
such
a
world
as
this
yet
none
the
less
did
he
hesitate
to
press
on
the
measure
which
was
to
adjust
his
own
future
to
make
profitable
his
issue
of
two
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
union
traction
to
secure
him
a
fixed
place
in
the
financial
oligarchy
of
america
and
of
the
world
the
state
legislature
at
this
time
was
ruled
over
by
a
small
group
of
pettifogging
individuals
who
came
up
from
the
respective
towns
counties
and
cities
of
the
state
but
who
bore
the
same
relation
to
the
communities
which
they
represented
and
to
their
superiors
and
equals
in
and
out
of
the
legislative
halls
at
springfield
that
men
do
to
such
allies
anywhere
in
any
given
field
why
do
we
call
them
pettifogging
and
dismiss
them
perhaps
they
were
pettifogging
but
certainly
no
more
so
than
any
other
shrewd
rat
or
animal
that
burrows
its
way
onward
and
shall
we
say
upward
the
deepest
controlling
principle
which
animated
these
individuals
was
the
oldest
and
first
that
of
picture
for
example
a
common
occurrence
that
of
senator
john
southack
conversing
with
perhaps
senator
george
mason
wade
of
gallatin
county
behind
a
legislative
door
in
one
of
the
senate
conference
chambers
toward
the
close
of
a
session
senator
southack
blinking
buttonholing
his
colleague
and
drawing
very
near
senator
wade
curious
confidential
expectant
a
genial
solid
experienced
slightly
paunchy
but
senator
wade
and
handsome
too
you
know
george
i
told
you
there
would
be
something
eventually
in
the
quincy
improvement
if
it
ever
worked
out
well
here
it
is
ed
truesdale
was
in
town
yesterday
this
with
a
knowing
eye
as
much
as
to
say
mum
the
word
here
five
hundred
count
it
a
quick
flashing
out
of
some
green
and
yellow
bills
from
a
vest
pocket
a
light
thumbing
and
counting
on
the
part
of
senator
wade
a
flare
of
comprehension
approval
gratitude
admiration
as
though
to
signify
this
is
something
like
thanks
john
i
had
pretty
near
forgot
all
about
it
nice
people
eh
if
you
see
ed
again
give
him
my
regards
when
that
bellville
contest
comes
up
let
me
know
wade
being
a
good
speaker
was
frequently
in
request
to
stir
up
the
populace
to
a
sense
of
pro
or
con
in
connection
with
some
legislative
crisis
impending
and
it
was
to
some
such
future
opportunity
that
he
now
pleasantly
referred
o
life
o
politics
o
necessity
o
hunger
o
burning
human
appetite
and
desire
on
every
hand
southack
was
an
unobtrusive
pleasant
quiet
man
of
the
type
that
would
usually
be
patronized
as
rural
and
pettifogging
by
men
high
in
commercial
affairs
he
was
none
the
less
well
fitted
to
his
task
a
capable
and
diligent
beneficiary
and
agent
he
was
well
dressed
only
cool
courageous
genial
with
eyes
that
were
material
but
not
cold
or
hard
and
a
light
springy
energetic
step
and
manner
a
holder
of
some
shares
a
director
of
one
of
his
local
county
banks
a
silent
partner
in
the
effingham
herald
he
was
a
personage
in
his
district
one
much
revered
by
local
swains
yet
a
more
game
and
rascally
type
was
not
to
be
found
in
all
rural
legislation
it
was
old
general
van
sickle
who
sought
out
southack
having
remembered
him
from
his
earlier
legislative
days
it
was
avery
who
conducted
the
negotiations
primarily
in
all
state
scheming
at
springfield
senator
southack
was
supposed
to
represent
the
one
of
the
great
traversing
the
state
and
incidentally
connecting
chicago
with
the
south
west
and
east
this
road
having
a
large
local
mileage
and
being
anxious
to
extend
its
franchises
in
chicago
and
elsewhere
was
deep
in
state
politics
by
a
curious
coincidence
it
was
mainly
financed
by
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
of
new
york
though
cowperwood
connection
with
that
concern
was
not
as
yet
known
going
to
southack
who
was
the
republican
whip
in
the
senate
avery
proposed
that
he
in
conjunction
with
judge
dickensheets
and
one
gilson
bickel
counsel
for
the
should
now
undertake
to
secure
sufficient
support
in
the
state
senate
and
house
for
a
scheme
introducing
the
new
york
idea
of
a
commission
into
the
governing
machinery
of
the
state
of
illinois
this
measure
be
it
noted
was
to
be
supplemented
by
one
very
interesting
and
important
little
proviso
to
the
effect
that
all
corporations
should
hereby
for
a
period
of
fifty
years
from
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
bill
into
law
be
assured
of
all
their
rights
privileges
and
immunities
including
franchises
of
course
this
was
justified
on
the
ground
that
any
such
radical
change
as
that
involved
in
the
introduction
of
a
commission
might
disturb
the
peace
and
of
corporations
with
franchises
which
still
had
years
to
run
senator
southack
saw
nothing
very
wrong
with
this
idea
though
he
naturally
perceived
what
it
was
all
about
and
whom
it
was
truly
designed
to
protect
yes
he
said
succinctly
i
see
the
lay
of
that
land
but
what
do
i
get
out
of
it
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
yourself
if
it
successful
ten
thousand
if
it
is
provided
you
make
an
honest
effort
two
thousand
dollars
apiece
for
any
of
the
boys
who
see
fit
to
help
you
if
we
win
is
that
perfectly
satisfactory
perfectly
replied
senator
southack
chapter
lv
cowperwood
and
the
governor
a
law
might
ipso
facto
have
been
quietly
passed
at
this
session
if
the
arbitrary
proviso
had
not
been
introduced
and
this
on
the
thin
excuse
that
so
novel
a
change
in
the
working
scheme
of
the
state
government
might
bring
about
hardship
to
some
this
redounded
too
obviously
to
the
benefit
of
one
particular
corporation
the
newspaper
men
as
thick
as
flies
about
the
halls
of
the
state
capitol
at
springfield
and
essentially
watchful
and
loyal
to
their
papers
were
quick
to
sense
the
true
state
of
affairs
never
were
there
such
hawks
as
newspapermen
these
wretches
employed
by
sniveling
newspapers
of
the
opposition
were
not
only
in
the
councils
of
politicians
in
the
pay
of
rival
corporations
in
the
confidence
of
the
governor
in
the
secrets
of
the
senators
and
local
representatives
but
were
here
and
there
in
one
confidence
a
piece
of
news
a
rumor
a
dream
a
fancy
whispered
by
senator
smith
to
senator
jones
or
by
representative

to

and
confided
by
him

one
knowing
whence
it
came
neither
senator

nor

had
told
any

no
word
of
the
confidence
imposed
in
charlie
white
or
eddie
burns
had
ever
been
breathed
but
there
you
were
the
thing
was
in
the
papers
the
storm
of
inquiry
opinion
opposition
was
on
no
one
knew
no
one
was
to
blame
but
it
was
on
and
the
battle
had
henceforth
to
be
fought
in
the
open
consider
also
the
governor
who
presided
at
this
time
in
the
executive
chamber
at
springfield
he
was
a
strange
tall
dark
osseous
man
who
owing
to
the
brooding
melancholy
character
of
his
own
disposition
had
a
checkered
and
a
somewhat
sad
career
behind
him
born
in
sweden
he
had
been
brought
to
america
as
a
child
and
allowed
or
compelled
to
fight
his
own
way
upward
under
all
the
grinding
aspects
of
poverty
owing
to
an
energetic
and
indomitable
temperament
he
had
through
years
of
law
practice
and
public
labors
of
various
kinds
built
up
for
himself
a
following
among
chicago
swedes
which
amounted
to
adoration
he
had
been
city
city
surveyor
district
attorney
and
for
six
or
eight
years
a
state
circuit
judge
in
all
these
capacities
he
had
manifested
a
tendency
to
do
the
right
as
he
saw
it
and
play
fair
qualities
which
endeared
him
to
the
idealistic
honest
and
with
a
hopeless
brooding
sympathy
for
the
miseries
of
the
poor
he
had
as
circuit
judge
and
also
as
district
attorney
rendered
various
decisions
which
had
made
him
very
unpopular
with
the
rich
and
powerful
decisions
in
damage
cases
fraud
cases
railroad
claim
cases
where
the
city
or
the
state
was
seeking
to
oust
various
powerful
railway
corporations
from
possession
of
property
yards
and
the
like
to
which
they
had
no
just
claim
at
the
same
time
the
populace
reading
the
news
items
of
his
doings
and
hearing
him
speak
on
various
and
sundry
occasions
conceived
a
great
fancy
for
him
he
was
primarily
fiery
a
brilliant
orator
a
dynamic
presence
in
addition
he
was
a
phase
which
homely
intellectuals
the
world
over
will
understand
to
the
shame
of
a
lying
age
that
because
of
quixotic
dogma
belies
its
greatest
desire
its
greatest
sorrow
its
greatest
joy
all
these
factors
turned
an
element
in
the
community
against
him
and
he
was
considered
dangerous
at
the
same
time
he
had
by
careful
economy
and
investment
built
up
a
fair
sized
fortune
recently
however
owing
to
the
craze
for
he
had
placed
much
of
his
holdings
in
a
somewhat
poorly
constructed
and
therefore
unprofitable
office
building
because
of
this
error
financial
wreck
was
threatening
him
even
now
he
was
knocking
at
the
doors
of
large
bonding
companies
for
assistance
this
man
in
company
with
the
antagonistic
financial
element
and
the
newspapers
constituted
as
regards
scheme
a
triumvirate
of
difficulties
not
easy
to
overcome
the
newspapers
in
due
time
catching
wind
of
the
true
purport
of
the
plan
ran
screaming
to
their
readers
with
the
horrible
intelligence
in
the
offices
of
schryhart
arneel
hand
and
merrill
as
well
as
in
other
centers
of
finance
there
was
considerable
puzzling
over
the
situation
and
then
a
shrewd
intelligent
deduction
was
made
do
you
see
what
he
up
to
hosmer
inquired
schryhart
of
hand
he
sees
that
we
have
him
scotched
here
in
chicago
as
things
stand
now
he
ca
go
into
the
city
council
and
ask
for
a
franchise
for
more
than
twenty
years
under
the
state
law
and
he
ca
do
that
for
three
or
four
years
yet
anyhow
his
franchises
do
expire
soon
enough
he
knows
that
by
the
time
they
do
expire
we
will
have
public
sentiment
aroused
to
such
a
point
that
no
council
however
crooked
it
may
be
will
dare
to
give
him
what
he
asks
unless
he
is
willing
to
make
a
heavy
return
to
the
city
if
he
does
that
it
will
end
his
scheme
of
selling
any
two
hundred
million
dollars
of
union
traction
at
six
per
cent
the
market
wo
back
him
up
he
ca
pay
twenty
per
cent
to
the
city
and
give
universal
transfers
and
pay
six
per
cent
on
two
hundred
million
dollars
and
everybody
knows
it
he
has
a
fine
scheme
of
making
a
cool
hundred
million
out
of
this
well
he
ca
do
it
we
must
get
the
newspapers
to
hammer
this
legislative
scheme
of
his
to
death
when
he
comes
into
the
local
council
he
must
pay
twenty
or
thirty
per
cent
of
the
gross
receipts
of
his
roads
to
the
city
he
must
give
free
transfers
from
every
one
of
his
lines
to
every
other
one
then
we
have
him
i
dislike
to
see
socialistic
ideas
fostered
but
it
ca
be
helped
we
have
to
do
it
if
we
ever
get
him
out
of
here
we
can
hush
up
the
newspapers
and
the
public
will
forget
about
it
at
least
we
can
hope
so
in
the
mean
time
the
governor
had
heard
the
whisper
of
boodle
a
word
of
the
day
expressive
of
a
corrupt
legislative
fund
not
at
all
a
man
nor
involved
in
the
financial
campaign
being
waged
against
cowperwood
nor
inclined
to
be
influenced
mentally
or
emotionally
by
superheated
charges
against
the
latter
he
nevertheless
speculated
deeply
in
a
vague
way
he
sensed
the
dreams
of
cowperwood
the
charge
of
seducing
women
so
frequently
made
against
the
magnate
so
shocking
to
the
yoked
conventionalists
did
not
disturb
him
at
all
back
of
the
onward
sweep
of
the
generations
he
himself
sensed
the
mystic
aphrodite
and
her
magic
he
realized
that
cowperwood
had
traveled
fast
that
he
was
pressing
to
the
utmost
a
great
advantage
in
the
face
of
great
obstacles
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
the
present
service
of
chicago
was
by
no
means
bad
would
he
be
proving
unfaithful
to
the
trust
imposed
on
him
by
the
great
electorate
of
illinois
if
he
were
to
advantage
cause
must
he
not
rather
in
the
sight
of
all
men
smoke
out
the
animating
causes
here
greed
ambition
colossal
as
opposed
to
the
selflessness
of
a
christian
ideal
and
of
a
democratic
theory
of
government
life
rises
to
a
high
plane
of
the
dramatic
and
hence
of
the
artistic
whenever
and
wherever
in
the
conflict
regarding
material
possession
there
enters
a
conception
of
the
ideal
it
was
this
that
lit
forever
the
beacon
fires
of
troy
that
thundered
eternally
in
the
horses
hoofs
at
arbela
and
in
the
guns
at
waterloo
ideals
were
here
at
stake
the
dreams
of
one
man
as
opposed
perhaps
to
the
ultimate
dreams
of
a
city
or
state
or
nation
the
grovelings
and
wallowings
of
a
democracy
slowly
blindly
trying
to
stagger
to
its
feet
in
this
conflict
taking
place
in
an
inland
state
where
men
were
clowns
and
churls
dancing
fiddlers
at
country
fairs
were
opposed
as
the
governor
saw
it
the
ideals
of
one
man
and
the
ideals
of
men
governor
swanson
decided
after
mature
deliberation
to
veto
the
bill
cowperwood
debonair
as
ever
faithful
as
ever
to
his
logic
and
his
conception
of
individuality
was
determined
that
no
stone
should
be
left
unturned
that
would
permit
him
to
triumph
that
would
carry
him
finally
to
the
gorgeous
throne
of
his
own
construction
having
first
engineered
the
matter
through
the
legislature
by
a
tortuous
process
fired
upon
at
every
step
by
the
press
he
next
sent
various
individuals
state
legislators
representatives
of
the
members
of
outside
corporations
to
see
the
governor
but
swanson
was
adamant
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
conscientiously
sanction
the
bill
finally
one
day
as
he
was
seated
in
his
chicago
business
office
a
fateful
chamber
located
in
the
troublesome
building
which
was
subsequently
to
wreck
his
fortune
and
which
was
the
raison
of
a
present
period
of
care
and
depression
enter
the
smug
comfortable
presence
of
judge
nahum
dickensheets
at
present
senior
counsel
of
the
north
chicago
street
railway
he
was
a
very
mountain
of
a
man
physically
agreeably
clothed
hard
and
yet
ingratiating
of
eye
a
thinker
a
reasoner
swanson
knew
much
of
him
by
reputation
and
otherwise
although
personally
they
were
no
more
than
speaking
acquaintances
how
are
you
governor
i
glad
to
see
you
again
i
heard
you
were
back
in
chicago
i
see
by
the
morning
papers
that
you
have
that
southack
bill
up
before
you
i
thought
i
would
come
over
and
have
a
few
words
with
you
about
it
if
you
have
no
objection
i
been
trying
to
get
down
to
springfield
for
the
last
three
weeks
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
before
you
reached
a
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other
do
you
mind
if
i
inquire
whether
you
have
decided
to
veto
it
the
faintly
perfumed
clean
and
agreeable
carried
in
his
hand
a
black
which
he
put
down
beside
him
on
the
floor
yes
judge
replied
swanson
i
practically
decided
to
veto
it
i
can
see
no
practical
reason
for
supporting
it
as
i
look
at
it
now
it
specious
and
special
not
particularly
called
for
or
necessary
at
this
time
the
governor
talked
with
a
slight
swedish
accent
intellectual
individual
a
long
placid
philosophic
discussion
of
all
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
situation
followed
the
governor
was
tired
distrait
but
ready
to
listen
in
a
tolerant
way
to
more
argument
along
a
line
with
which
he
was
already
fully
familiar
he
knew
of
course
that
dickensheets
was
counsel
for
the
north
chicago
street
railway
company
i
very
glad
to
have
heard
what
you
have
to
say
judge
finally
commented
the
governor
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
have
given
this
matter
serious
thought
i
have
i
know
most
of
the
things
that
have
been
done
down
at
springfield
cowperwood
is
an
able
man
i
charge
any
more
against
him
than
i
do
against
twenty
other
agencies
that
are
operating
down
there
at
this
very
moment
i
know
what
his
difficulties
are
i
can
hardly
be
accused
of
sympathizing
with
his
enemies
for
they
certainly
do
not
sympathize
with
me
i
am
not
even
listening
to
the
newspapers
this
is
a
matter
of
faith
in
democracy
a
difference
in
ideals
between
myself
and
many
other
men
i
vetoed
the
bill
yet
i
do
say
that
something
may
not
arise
to
make
me
sign
it
my
present
intention
unless
i
hear
something
much
more
favorable
in
its
behalf
than
i
have
already
heard
is
to
veto
it
governor
said
dickensheets
rising
let
me
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
i
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
wish
to
influence
you
outside
the
line
of
your
private
convictions
and
your
personal
sense
of
fair
play
at
the
same
time
i
have
tried
to
make
plain
to
you
how
essential
it
is
how
only
fair
and
right
that
this
local
business
should
be
removed
out
of
the
realm
of
sentiment
emotion
public
passion
envy
buncombe
and
all
the
other
influences
that
are
at
work
to
frustrate
and
make
difficult
the
work
of
cowperwood
all
envy
i
tell
you
his
enemies
are
willing
to
sacrifice
every
principle
of
justice
and
fair
play
to
see
him
eliminated
that
sums
it
up
that
may
all
be
true
replied
swanson
just
the
same
there
is
another
principle
involved
here
which
you
do
not
seem
to
see
or
do
not
care
to
consider
the
right
of
the
people
under
the
state
constitution
to
a
consideration
a
revaluation
of
their
contracts
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner
agreed
upon
under
the
original
franchise
what
you
propose
is
sumptuary
legislation
it
makes
null
and
void
an
agreement
between
the
people
and
the
companies
at
a
time
when
the
people
have
a
right
to
expect
a
full
and
free
consideration
of
this
matter
aside
from
state
legislative
influence
and
control
to
persuade
the
state
legislature
by
influence
or
by
any
other
means
to
step
in
at
this
time
and
interfere
is
unfair
the
propositions
involved
in
those
bills
should
be
referred
to
the
people
at
the
next
election
for
approval
or
not
just
as
they
see
fit
that
is
the
way
this
matter
should
be
arranged
it
will
not
do
to
come
into
the
legislature
and
influence
or
buy
votes
and
then
expect
me
to
write
my
signature
under
the
whole
matter
as
satisfactory
swanson
was
not
heated
or
antipathetic
he
was
cool
firm
dickensheets
passed
his
hand
over
a
wide
high
temple
he
seemed
to
be
meditating
something
some
hitherto
untried
statement
or
course
of
action
well
governor
he
repeated
i
want
to
thank
you
anyhow
you
have
been
exceedingly
kind
by
the
way
i
see
you
have
a
large
roomy
safe
here
he
had
picked
up
the
bag
he
was
carrying
i
wonder
if
i
might
leave
this
here
for
a
day
or
two
in
your
care
it
contains
some
papers
that
i
do
not
wish
to
carry
into
the
country
with
me
would
you
mind
locking
it
up
in
your
safe
and
letting
me
have
it
when
i
send
for
it
with
pleasure
replied
the
governor
he
took
it
placed
it
in
lower
storage
space
and
closed
and
locked
the
door
the
two
men
parted
with
a
genial
the
governor
returned
to
his
meditations
the
judge
hurried
to
catch
a
car
about
eleven
the
next
morning
swanson
was
still
working
in
his
office
worrying
greatly
over
some
method
whereby
he
could
raise
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
defray
interest
charges
repairs
and
other
payments
on
a
structure
that
was
by
no
means
meeting
expenses
and
was
hence
a
drain
at
this
juncture
his
office
door
opened
and
his
very
youthful
presented
him
the
card
of
cowperwood
the
governor
had
never
seen
him
before
cowperwood
entered
brisk
fresh
forceful
he
was
as
crisp
as
a
new
dollar
bill
as
clean
sharp
firmly
limned
governor
swanson
i
believe
yes
sir
the
two
were
scrutinizing
each
other
defensively
i
am
cowperwood
i
come
to
have
a
very
few
words
with
you
i
will
take
very
little
of
your
time
i
do
not
wish
to
go
over
any
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
gone
over
before
i
am
satisfied
that
you
know
all
about
them
yes
i
had
a
talk
with
judge
dickensheets
yesterday
just
so
governor
knowing
all
that
you
do
permit
me
to
put
one
more
matter
before
you
i
know
that
you
are
comparatively
a
poor
man
that
every
dollar
you
have
is
at
present
practically
tied
in
this
building
i
know
of
two
places
where
you
have
applied
for
a
loan
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
have
been
refused
because
you
sufficient
security
to
offer
outside
of
this
building
which
is
mortgaged
up
to
its
limit
as
it
stands
the
men
as
you
must
know
who
are
fighting
you
are
fighting
me
i
am
a
scoundrel
because
i
am
selfish
and
ambitious
a
materialist
you
are
not
a
scoundrel
but
a
dangerous
person
because
you
are
an
idealist
whether
you
veto
this
bill
or
not
you
will
never
again
be
elected
governor
of
illinois
if
the
people
who
are
fighting
me
succeed
as
they
will
succeed
in
fighting
you
swanson
dark
eyes
burned
illuminatively
he
nodded
his
head
in
assent
governor
i
have
come
here
this
morning
to
bribe
you
if
i
can
i
do
not
agree
with
your
ideals
in
the
last
analysis
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
work
i
am
sure
i
do
not
believe
in
most
of
the
things
that
you
believe
in
life
is
different
at
bottom
perhaps
from
what
either
you
or
i
may
think
just
the
same
as
compared
with
other
men
i
sympathize
with
you
i
will
loan
you
that
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
two
or
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
more
besides
if
you
wish
you
need
never
pay
me
a
dollar
or
you
can
if
you
wish
suit
yourself
in
that
black
bag
which
judge
dickensheets
brought
here
yesterday
and
which
is
in
your
safe
is
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
cash
he
did
not
have
the
courage
to
mention
it
sign
the
bill
and
let
me
beat
the
men
who
are
trying
to
beat
me
i
will
support
you
in
the
future
with
any
amount
of
money
or
influence
that
i
can
bring
to
bear
in
any
political
contest
you
may
choose
to
enter
state
or
national
cowperwood
eyes
glowed
like
a
large
genial
collie
there
was
a
suggestion
of
sympathetic
appeal
in
them
rich
and
deep
and
even
more
than
that
a
philosophic
perception
of
ineffable
things
swanson
arose
you
really
do
mean
to
say
that
you
are
trying
to
bribe
me
openly
do
you
he
inquired
in
spite
of
a
conventional
impulse
to
burst
forth
in
moralistic
denunciation
solemnly
phrased
he
was
compelled
for
the
moment
to
see
the
other
man
viewpoint
they
were
working
in
different
directions
going
different
ways
to
what
ultimate
end
cowperwood
continued
the
governor
his
face
a
physiognomy
out
of
goya
his
eye
alight
with
a
kind
of
understanding
sympathy
i
suppose
i
ought
to
resent
this
but
i
ca
i
see
your
point
of
view
sorry
but
i
ca
help
you
nor
myself
my
political
belief
my
ideals
compel
me
to
veto
this
bill
when
i
forsake
these
i
am
done
politically
with
myself
i
may
not
be
elected
governor
again
but
that
does
not
matter
either
i
could

i
wo
i
shall
have
to
bid
you
good
morning
he
moved
toward
the
safe
slowly
opened
it
took
out
the
bag
and
brought
it
over
you
must
take
that
with
you
he
added
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
curiously
sadly
the
one
with
a
burden
of
financial
political
and
moral
worry
on
his
spirit
the
other
with
an
unconquerable
determination
not
to
be
worsted
even
in
defeat
governor
concluded
cowperwood
in
the
most
genial
contented
undisturbed
voice
you
will
live
to
see
another
legislature
pass
and
another
governor
sign
some
such
bill
it
will
not
be
done
this
session
apparently
but
it
will
be
done
i
am
not
through
because
my
case
is
right
and
fair
just
the
same
after
you
have
vetoed
the
bill
come
and
see
me
and
i
will
loan
you
that
one
hundred
thousand
if
you
want
it
cowperwood
went
out
swanson
vetoed
the
bill
it
is
on
record
that
subsequently
he
borrowed
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
from
cowperwood
to
stay
him
from
ruin
chapter
lvi
the
ordeal
of
berenice
at
the
news
that
swanson
had
refused
to
sign
the
bill
and
that
the
legislature
lacked
sufficient
courage
to
pass
it
over
his
veto
both
schryhart
and
hand
literally
rubbed
their
hands
in
comfortable
satisfaction
well
hosmer
said
schryhart
the
next
day
when
they
met
at
their
favorite
club
the
union
league
it
looks
as
though
we
were
making
some
little
progress
after
all
does
it
our
friend
did
succeed
in
turning
that
little
trick
did
he
he
beamed
almost
ecstatically
upon
his
solid
companion
not
this
time
i
wonder
what
move
he
will
decide
to
make
next
i
do
see
very
well
what
it
can
be
he
knows
now
that
he
ca
get
his
franchises
without
a
compromise
that
will
eat
into
his
profits
and
if
that
happens
he
ca
sell
his
union
traction
stock
this
legislative
scheme
of
his
must
have
cost
him
all
of
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
what
has
he
to
show
for
it
the
new
legislature
unless
i
greatly
mistaken
will
be
afraid
to
touch
anything
in
connection
with
him
it
hardly
likely
that
any
of
the
springfield
politicians
will
want
to
draw
the
fire
of
the
newspapers
again
schryhart
felt
very
powerful
imposing
sleek
indeed
now
that
his
theory
of
newspaper
publicity
as
a
cure
was
apparently
beginning
to
work
hand
more
saturnine
more
responsive
to
the
uncertainty
of
things
mundane
the
shifty
undercurrents
that
are
perpetually
sapping
and
mining
below
was
agreeable
but
not
sure
perhaps
so
in
regard
to
his
eastern
life
during
this
interlude
cowperwood
had
been
becoming
more
and
more
keenly
alive
to
the
futility
of
the
attempt
to
effect
a
social
rescue
for
aileen
what
was
the
use
he
often
asked
himself
as
he
contemplated
her
movements
thoughts
plans
as
contrasted
with
the
natural
efficiency
taste
grace
and
subtlety
of
a
woman
like
berenice
he
felt
that
the
latter
could
if
she
would
smooth
over
in
an
adroit
way
all
the
silly
social
antagonisms
which
were
now
afflicting
him
it
was
a
woman
game
he
frequently
told
himself
and
would
never
be
adjusted
till
he
had
the
woman
simultaneously
aileen
looking
at
the
situation
from
her
own
point
of
view
and
nonplussed
by
the
ineffectiveness
of
mere
wealth
when
not
combined
with
a
certain
social
something
which
she
did
not
appear
to
have
was
nevertheless
unwilling
to
surrender
her
dream
what
was
it
she
asked
herself
over
and
over
that
made
this
great
difference
between
women
and
women
the
question
contained
its
own
answer
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
still
very
and
an
adept
in
after
her
manner
and
taste
so
great
had
been
the
newspaper
palaver
regarding
the
arrival
of
a
new
multimillionaire
from
the
west
and
the
palace
he
was
erecting
that
even
tradesmen
clerks
and
knew
of
her
almost
invariably
when
called
upon
to
state
her
name
in
such
quarters
she
was
greeted
by
a
slight
start
of
recognition
a
swift
glance
of
examination
whispers
even
open
comment
that
was
something
yet
how
much
more
and
how
different
were
those
rarefied
reaches
of
social
supremacy
to
which
popular
repute
bears
scarcely
any
relationship
at
all
how
different
indeed
from
what
cowperwood
had
said
in
chicago
she
had
fancied
that
when
they
took
up
their
formal
abode
in
new
york
he
would
make
an
attempt
to
straighten
out
his
life
somewhat
to
modify
the
number
of
his
indifferent
amours
and
to
present
an
illusion
of
solidarity
and
unity
yet
now
that
they
had
actually
arrived
she
noticed
that
he
was
more
concerned
with
his
heightened
political
and
financial
complications
in
illinois
and
with
his
than
he
was
with
what
might
happen
to
be
going
on
in
the
new
home
or
what
could
be
made
to
happen
there
as
in
the
days
of
old
she
was
constantly
puzzled
by
his
persistent
evenings
out
and
his
sudden
appearances
and
disappearances
yet
determine
as
she
might
rage
secretly
or
openly
as
she
would
she
could
not
cure
herself
of
the
infection
of
cowperwood
the
lure
that
surrounded
and
substantiated
a
mind
and
spirit
far
greater
than
any
other
she
had
ever
known
neither
honor
virtue
consistent
charity
nor
sympathy
was
there
but
only
a
gay
foamy
unterrified
sufficiency
and
a
creative
constructive
sense
of
beauty
that
like
sunlit
spray
glowing
with
all
the
irradiative
glories
of
the
morning
danced
and
fled
spun
driftwise
over
a
heavy
sea
of
circumstance
life
however
dark
and
somber
could
never
apparently
cloud
his
soul
brooding
and
idling
in
the
wonder
palace
of
his
construction
aileen
could
see
what
he
was
like
the
silver
fountain
in
the
court
of
orchids
the
glow
of
the
pink
marble
chamber
with
its
birds
and
flowers
the
serried
brilliance
of
his
amazing
were
all
like
him
were
really
the
color
of
his
soul
to
think
that
after
all
she
was
not
the
one
to
bind
him
to
subjection
to
hold
him
by
golden
yet
steely
threads
of
fancy
to
the
hem
of
her
garment
to
think
that
he
should
no
longer
walk
a
slave
of
his
desire
behind
the
chariot
of
her
spiritual
and
physical
superiority
yet
she
could
not
give
up
by
this
time
cowperwood
had
managed
through
infinite
tact
and
a
stoic
disregard
of
his
own
aches
and
pains
to
at
least
a
temporary
working
arrangement
with
the
carter
household
to
carter
he
was
still
a
son
of
light
actually
in
a
mournful
way
she
pleaded
for
cowperwood
vouching
for
his
disinterestedness
and
generosity
berenice
on
the
other
hand
was
swept
between
her
craving
for
a
great
state
for
herself
luxury
power
and
her
desire
to
conform
to
the
current
ethics
and
morals
of
life
cowperwood
was
married
and
because
of
his
attitude
of
affection
for
her
his
money
was
tainted
she
had
long
speculated
on
his
relation
to
aileen
the
basis
of
their
differences
had
often
wondered
why
neither
she
nor
her
mother
had
ever
been
introduced
what
type
of
woman
was
the
second
cowperwood
beyond
generalities
cowperwood
had
never
mentioned
her
berenice
actually
thought
to
seek
her
out
in
some
inconspicuous
way
but
as
it
chanced
one
night
her
curiosity
was
rewarded
without
effort
she
was
at
the
opera
with
friends
and
her
escort
nudged
her
arm
have
you
noticed
box
the
lady
in
white
satin
with
the
green
lace
shawl
yes
berenice
raised
her
glasses
frank
algernon
cowperwood
the
wife
of
the
chicago
millionaire
they
have
just
built
that
house
at
street
he
has
part
lease
of
number
i
believe
berenice
almost
started
but
retained
her
composure
giving
merely
an
indifferent
glance
a
little
while
after
she
adjusted
her
glasses
carefully
and
studied
cowperwood
she
noted
curiously
that
aileen
hair
was
somewhat
the
color
of
her
own
more
carroty
red
she
studied
her
eyes
which
were
slightly
ringed
her
smooth
cheeks
and
full
mouth
thickened
somewhat
by
drinking
and
dissipation
aileen
was
she
thought
handsome
in
a
material
way
though
so
much
older
than
herself
was
it
merely
age
that
was
alienating
cowperwood
or
was
it
some
intellectual
difference
obviously
cowperwood
was
well
over
forty
a
fact
which
did
not
give
berenice
any
sense
of
satisfaction
or
of
advantage
she
really
did
not
care
enough
it
did
occur
to
her
however
that
this
woman
whom
she
was
observing
had
probably
given
the
best
years
of
her
life
to
cowperwood
the
brilliant
years
of
her
girlhood
and
now
he
was
tired
of
her
there
were
small
carefully
powdered
lines
at
the
tails
of
aileen
eyes
and
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
at
the
same
time
she
seemed
preternaturally
gay
kittenish
spoiled
with
her
were
two
men
one
a
actor
sinisterly
handsome
a
man
with
a
brutal
unclean
reputation
the
other
a
young
social
pretender
both
unknown
to
berenice
her
knowledge
was
to
come
from
her
escort
a
loquacious
youth
more
or
less
versed
as
it
happened
in
the
gay
life
of
the
city
i
hear
that
she
is
creating
quite
a
stir
in
bohemia
he
observed
if
she
expects
to
enter
society
it
a
poor
way
to
begin
do
you
think
do
you
know
that
she
expects
to
all
the
usual
signs
are
out
a
box
here
a
house
on
fifth
avenue
this
study
of
aileen
puzzled
and
disturbed
berenice
a
little
nevertheless
she
felt
immensely
superior
her
soul
seemed
to
soar
over
the
plain
aileen
inhabited
the
type
of
the
latter
escorts
suggested
error
a
lack
of
social
discrimination
because
of
the
high
position
he
had
succeeded
in
achieving
cowperwood
was
entitled
no
doubt
to
be
dissatisfied
his
wife
had
not
kept
pace
with
him
or
rather
had
not
eluded
him
in
his
onward
flight
had
not
run
swiftly
before
like
a
winged
victory
berenice
reflected
that
if
she
were
dealing
with
such
a
man
he
should
never
know
her
truly
he
should
be
made
to
wonder
and
to
doubt
lines
of
care
and
disappointment
should
never
mar
her
face
she
would
scheme
and
dream
and
conceal
and
evade
he
should
dance
attendance
whoever
he
was
nevertheless
here
she
herself
was
at
unmarried
her
background
insecure
the
very
ground
on
which
she
walked
treacherous
braxmar
knew
and
beales
chadsey
and
cowperwood
at
least
three
or
four
of
her
acquaintances
must
have
been
at
the
waldorf
on
that
fatal
night
how
long
would
it
be
before
others
became
aware
she
tried
eluding
her
mother
cowperwood
and
the
situation
generally
by
freely
accepting
more
extended
invitations
and
by
trying
to
see
whether
there
was
not
some
opening
for
her
in
the
field
of
art
she
thought
of
painting
and
essayed
several
canvases
which
she
took
to
dealers
the
work
was
subtle
remote
fanciful
a
snow
scene
with
purple
edges
a
thinking
satyr
in
his
heaviness
brooding
over
a
cloudy
valley
a
lurking
devil
peering
at
a
praying
marguerite
a
dutch
interior
inspired
by
batjer
and
various
dancing
figures
phlegmatic
dealers
of
somber
mien
admitted
some
promise
but
pointed
out
the
difficulty
of
sales
beginners
were
numerous
art
was
long
if
she
went
on
of
course
let
them
see
other
things
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
dancing
this
art
in
its
interpretative
sense
was
just
being
introduced
into
america
a
certain
althea
baker
having
created
a
good
deal
of
stir
in
society
by
this
means
with
the
idea
of
duplicating
or
surpassing
the
success
of
this
woman
berenice
conceived
a
dance
series
of
her
own
one

to
be
the
terror
a
nymph
dancing
in
the
spring

but
eventually
pursued
and
terrorized
by
a

a
fantasy
illustrative
of
proud
another
the
vestal
a
study
from
roman
choric
worship
after
spending
considerable
time
at
pocono
evolving
costumes
poses
and
the
like
berenice
finally
hinted
at
the
plan
to
batjer
declaring
that
she
would
enjoy
the
artistic
outlet
it
would
afford
and
indicating
at
the
same
time
that
it
might
provide
the
necessary
solution
of
a
problem
of
ways
and
means
why
bevy
how
you
talk
commented
batjer
and
with
your
possibilities
why
do
you
marry
first
and
do
your
dancing
afterward
you
might
compel
a
certain
amount
of
attention
that
way
because
of
hubby
how
droll
whom
would
you
suggest
that
i
marry
at
once
oh
when
it
comes
to
that
replied
batjer
with
a
slight
reproachful
lift
in
her
voice
and
thinking
of
kilmer
duelma
but
surely
your
need
is
so
pressing
if
you
were
to
take
up
professional
dancing
i
might
have
to
cut
you
afterward
particularly
if
any
one
else
did
she
smiled
the
sweetest
most
sensible
smile
batjer
accompanied
her
suggestions
nearly
always
with
a
slight
sniff
and
cough
berenice
could
see
that
the
mere
fact
of
this
conversation
made
a
slight
difference
in
batjer
world
poverty
was
a
dangerous
topic
the
mere
odor
of
it
suggested
a
kind
of
horror
perhaps
the
equivalent
of
error
or
sin
others
berenice
now
suspected
would
take
affright
even
more
swiftly
subsequent
to
this
however
she
made
one
slight
investigation
of
those
realms
that
govern
professional
theatrical
engagements
it
was
a
most
disturbing
experience
the
mere
color
and
odor
of
the
stuffy
offices
the
gauche
material
attendants
the
impossible
aspirants
and
participants
in
this
world
the
crudeness
the
effrontery
the
materiality
the
sensuality
it
came
to
her
as
a
sickening
breath
and
for
the
moment
frightened
her
what
would
become
of
refinement
there
what
of
delicacy
how
could
one
rise
and
sustain
an
individual
dignity
and
control
in
such
a
world
as
this
cowperwood
was
now
suggesting
as
a
binding
link
that
he
should
buy
a
home
for
them
in
park
avenue
where
such
social
functions
as
would
be
of
advantage
to
berenice
and
in
some
measure
to
himself
as
an
occasional
guest
might
be
indulged
in
carter
a
fool
of
comfort
was
pleased
to
welcome
this
idea
it
promised
to
give
her
absolute
financial
security
for
the
future
i
know
how
it
is
with
you
frank
she
declared
i
know
you
need
some
place
that
you
can
call
a
home
the
whole
difficulty
will
be
with
bevy
ever
since
that
miserable
puppy
made
those
charges
against
me
i
have
been
able
to
talk
to
her
at
all
she
does
seem
to
want
to
do
anything
i
suggest
you
have
much
more
influence
with
her
than
i
have
if
you
explain
it
may
be
all
right
instantly
cowperwood
saw
an
opportunity
intensely
pleased
with
this
confession
of
weakness
on
the
part
of
the
mother
he
went
to
berenice
but
by
his
usual
method
of
indirect
direction
you
know
bevy
he
said
one
afternoon
when
he
found
her
alone
i
have
been
wondering
if
it
would
be
better
if
i
bought
a
large
house
for
you
and
your
mother
here
in
new
york
where
you
and
she
could
do
entertaining
on
a
large
scale
since
i
ca
spend
my
money
on
myself
i
might
as
well
spend
it
on
some
one
who
would
make
an
interesting
use
of
it
you
might
include
me
as
an
uncle
or
father
cousin
or
something
of
that
sort
he
added
lightly
berenice
who
saw
quite
clearly
the
trap
he
was
setting
for
her
was
nonplussed
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
a
house
if
it
were
beautifully
furnished
would
be
an
interesting
asset
people
in
society
loved
fixed
notable
dwellings
she
had
observed
that
what
functions
could
not
be
held
if
only
her
mother
past
were
not
charged
against
her
that
was
the
great
difficulty
it
was
almost
an
arabian
situation
heightened
by
the
glitter
of
gold
and
cowperwood
was
always
so
diplomatic
he
came
forward
with
such
a
bland
engaging
smile
his
hands
were
so
shapely
and
seeking
a
house
such
as
you
speak
of
would
enlarge
the
debt
beyond
payment
i
presume
she
remarked
sardonically
and
with
a
sad
almost
contemptuous
gesture
cowperwood
realized
how
her
piercing
intellect
was
following
his
shifty
trail
and
winced
she
must
see
that
her
fate
was
in
his
hands
but
oh
if
she
would
only
surrender
how
swiftly
every
dollar
of
his
vast
fortune
should
be
piled
humbly
at
her
feet
she
should
have
her
heart
desire
if
money
would
buy
it
she
could
say
to
him
go
and
he
would
go
come
and
he
would
come
berenice
he
said
getting
up
i
know
what
you
think
you
fancy
i
am
trying
to
further
my
own
interests
in
this
way
but
i
not
i
would
compromise
you
ultimately
for
all
the
wealth
of
india
i
have
told
you
where
i
stand
every
dollar
that
i
have
is
yours
to
do
with
as
you
choose
on
any
basis
that
you
may
care
to
name
i
have
no
future
outside
of
you
none
except
art
i
do
not
expect
you
to
marry
me
take
all
that
i
have
wipe
society
under
your
feet
do
think
that
i
will
ever
charge
it
up
as
a
debt
i
wo
i
want
you
to
hold
your
own
just
answer
me
one
question
i
wo
ever
ask
another
yes
if
i
were
single
now
and
you
were
not
in
love
or
married
would
you
consider
me
at
all
his
eyes
pleaded
as
never
had
they
pleaded
before
she
started
looked
concerned
severe
then
relaxed
as
suddenly
let
me
see
she
said
with
a
slight
brightening
of
the
eyes
and
a
toss
of
her
head
that
is
a
second
cousin
to
a
proposal
is
it
you
have
no
right
to
make
it
you
are
single
and
are
likely
to
be
why
should
i
try
to
read
the
future
she
walked
indifferently
out
of
the
room
and
cowperwood
stayed
a
moment
to
think
obviously
he
had
triumphed
in
a
way
she
had
not
taken
great
offense
she
must
like
him
and
would
marry
him
if
only
only
aileen
and
now
he
wished
more
definitely
and
forcefully
than
ever
that
he
were
really
and
truly
free
he
felt
that
if
ever
he
wished
to
attain
berenice
he
must
persuade
aileen
to
divorce
him
chapter
lvii
aileen
last
card
it
was
not
until
some
little
time
after
they
were
established
in
the
new
house
that
aileen
first
came
upon
any
evidence
of
the
existence
of
berenice
fleming
in
a
general
way
she
assumed
that
there
were
women
possibly
some
of
whom
she
had
known
stephanie
hand
florence
cochrane
or
later
arrivals
yet
so
long
as
they
were
not
obtruded
on
her
she
permitted
herself
the
thought
that
things
were
not
as
bad
as
they
might
be
so
long
indeed
as
cowperwood
was
genuinely
promiscuous
so
long
as
he
trotted
here
and
there
not
snared
by
any
particular
siren
she
could
not
despair
for
after
all
she
had
ensnared
him
and
held
him
deliciously
without
variation
she
believed
for
all
of
ten
years
a
feat
which
no
other
woman
had
achieved
before
or
after
rita
sohlberg
might
have
succeeded
the
beast
how
she
hated
the
thought
of
rita
by
this
time
however
cowperwood
was
getting
on
in
years
the
day
must
come
when
he
would
be
less
keen
for
variability
or
at
least
would
think
it
no
longer
worth
while
to
change
if
only
he
did
not
find
some
one
woman
some
circe
who
would
bind
and
enslave
him
in
these
later
years
as
she
had
herself
done
in
his
earlier
ones
all
might
yet
be
well
at
the
same
time
she
lived
in
daily
terror
of
a
discovery
which
was
soon
to
follow
she
had
gone
out
one
day
to
pay
a
call
on
some
one
to
whom
rhees
grier
the
chicago
sculptor
had
given
her
an
introduction
crossing
central
park
in
one
of
the
new
french
machines
which
cowperwood
had
purchased
for
her
indulgence
her
glance
wandered
down
a
branch
road
to
where
another
automobile
similar
to
her
own
was
stalled
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
at
which
time
cowperwood
was
presumably
engaged
in
wall
street
yet
there
he
was
and
with
him
two
women
neither
of
whom
in
the
speed
of
passing
could
aileen
quite
make
out
she
had
her
car
halted
and
driven
to
within
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
a
chauffeur
whom
she
did
not
know
was
tinkering
at
a
handsome
machine
while
on
the
grass
near
by
stood
cowperwood
and
a
tall
slender
girl
with
red
hair
somewhat
like
aileen
own
her
expression
was
aloof
poetic
rhapsodical
aileen
could
not
analyze
it
but
it
fixed
her
attention
completely
in
the
tonneau
sat
an
elderly
lady
whom
aileen
at
once
assumed
to
be
the
girl
mother
who
were
they
what
was
cowperwood
doing
here
in
the
park
at
this
hour
where
were
they
going
with
a
horrible
retch
of
envy
she
noted
upon
cowperwood
face
a
smile
the
like
and
import
of
which
she
well
knew
how
often
she
had
seen
it
years
and
years
before
having
escaped
detection
she
ordered
her
chauffeur
to
follow
the
car
which
soon
started
at
a
safe
distance
she
saw
cowperwood
and
the
two
ladies
put
down
at
one
of
the
great
hotels
and
followed
them
into
the
where
from
behind
a
screen
after
the
most
careful
manoeuvering
she
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
them
at
her
leisure
she
drank
in
every
detail
of
face
the
delicately
pointed
chin
the
clear
fixed
blue
eyes
the
straight
sensitive
nose
and
tawny
hair
calling
the
head
waiter
she
inquired
the
names
of
the
two
women
and
in
return
for
a
liberal
tip
was
informed
at
once
ira
carter
i
believe
and
her
daughter
miss
fleming
miss
berenice
fleming
carter
was
fleming
once
aileen
followed
them
out
eventually
and
in
her
own
car
pursued
them
to
their
door
into
which
cowperwood
also
disappeared
the
next
day
by
telephoning
the
apartment
to
make
inquiry
she
learned
that
they
actually
lived
there
after
a
few
days
of
brooding
she
employed
a
detective
and
learned
that
cowperwood
was
a
constant
visitor
at
the
carters
that
the
machine
in
which
they
rode
was
his
maintained
at
a
separate
garage
and
that
they
were
of
society
truly
aileen
would
never
have
followed
the
clue
so
vigorously
had
it
not
been
for
the
look
she
had
seen
cowperwood
fix
on
the
girl
in
the
park
and
in
the
restaurant
an
air
of
which
could
not
be
gainsaid
let
no
one
ridicule
the
terrors
of
unrequited
love
its
tentacles
are
cancerous
its
grip
is
of
icy
death
sitting
in
her
boudoir
immediately
after
these
events
driving
walking
shopping
calling
on
the
few
with
whom
she
had
managed
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
aileen
thought
morning
noon
and
night
of
this
new
woman
the
pale
delicate
face
haunted
her
what
were
those
eyes
so
remote
in
their
gaze
surveying
love
cowperwood
yes
yes
gone
in
a
flash
and
permanently
as
it
seemed
to
aileen
was
the
value
of
this
house
her
dream
of
a
new
social
entrance
and
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
endured
so
much
cowperwood
being
absent
for
a
fortnight
she
moped
in
her
room
sighed
raged
and
then
began
to
drink
finally
she
sent
for
an
actor
who
had
once
paid
attention
to
her
in
chicago
and
whom
she
had
later
met
here
in
the
circle
of
the
theaters
she
was
not
so
much
burning
with
lust
as
determined
in
her
drunken
gloom
that
she
would
have
revenge
for
days
there
followed
an
orgy
in
which
wine
bestiality
mutual
recrimination
hatred
and
despair
were
involved
sobering
eventually
she
wondered
what
cowperwood
would
think
of
her
now
if
he
knew
this
could
he
ever
love
her
any
more
could
he
even
tolerate
her
but
what
did
he
care
it
served
him
right
the
dog
she
would
show
him
she
would
wreck
his
dream
she
would
make
her
own
life
a
scandal
and
his
too
she
would
shame
him
before
all
the
world
he
should
never
have
a
divorce
he
should
never
be
able
to
marry
a
girl
like
that
and
leave
her
alone
never
never
never
when
cowperwood
returned
she
snarled
at
him
without
vouchsafing
an
explanation
he
suspected
at
once
that
she
had
been
spying
upon
his
manoeuvers
moreover
he
did
not
fail
to
notice
her
heavy
eyes
superheated
cheeks
and
sickly
breath
obviously
she
had
abandoned
her
dream
of
a
social
victory
of
some
kind
and
was
entering
on
a
career
of
what
debauchery
since
coming
to
new
york
she
had
failed
utterly
he
thought
to
make
any
single
intelligent
move
toward
her
social
rehabilitation
the
banal
realms
of
art
and
the
stage
with
which
in
his
absence
or
neglect
she
had
trifled
with
here
as
she
had
done
in
chicago
were
worse
than
useless
they
were
destructive
he
must
have
a
long
talk
with
her
one
of
these
days
must
confess
frankly
to
his
passion
for
berenice
and
appeal
to
her
sympathy
and
good
sense
what
scenes
would
follow
yet
she
might
succumb
at
that
despair
pride
disgust
might
move
her
besides
he
could
now
bestow
upon
her
a
very
large
fortune
she
could
go
to
europe
or
remain
here
and
live
in
luxury
he
would
always
remain
friendly
with
her
helpful
advisory
if
she
would
permit
it
the
conversation
which
eventually
followed
on
this
topic
was
of
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
it
sounded
hollow
and
unnatural
within
the
walls
where
it
took
place
consider
the
great
house
in
upper
fifth
avenue
its
magnificent
chambers
aglow
of
a
stormy
sunday
night
cowperwood
was
lingering
in
the
city
at
this
time
busy
with
a
group
of
eastern
financiers
who
were
influencing
his
contest
in
the
state
legislature
of
illinois
aileen
was
momentarily
consoled
by
the
thought
that
for
him
perhaps
love
might
after
all
be
a
thing
apart
a
thing
no
longer
vital
and
he
was
sitting
in
the
court
of
orchids
reading
a
book
the
diary
of
cellini
which
some
one
had
recommended
to
him
stopping
to
think
now
and
then
of
things
in
chicago
or
springfield
or
to
make
a
note
outside
the
rain
was
splashing
in
torrents
on
the
asphalt
of
fifth
avenue
the
park
opposite
a
shadow
aileen
was
in
the
strumming
indifferently
she
was
thinking
of
times
past
lynde
from
whom
she
had
not
heard
in
half
a
year
watson
skeet
the
sculptor
who
was
also
out
of
her
ken
at
present
when
cowperwood
was
in
the
city
and
in
the
house
she
was
accustomed
from
habit
to
remain
indoors
or
near
so
great
is
the
influence
of
past
customs
of
devotion
that
they
linger
long
past
the
hour
when
the
act
ceases
to
become
valid
what
an
awful
night
she
observed
once
strolling
to
a
window
to
peer
out
from
behind
a
brocaded
valance
it
is
bad
is
it
replied
cowperwood
as
she
returned
you
thought
of
going
anywhere
this
evening
no
oh
no
replied
aileen
indifferently
she
rose
restlessly
from
the
piano
and
strolled
on
into
the
great
stopping
before
one
of
raphael
sanzio
holy
families
only
recently
hung
she
paused
to
contemplate
the
serene
face
medieval
madonnaesque
italian
the
lady
seemed
fragile
colorless
spineless
without
life
were
there
such
women
why
did
artists
paint
them
yet
the
little
christ
was
sweet
art
bored
aileen
unless
others
were
enthusiastic
she
craved
only
the
fanfare
of
the
living
not
painted
resemblances
she
returned
to
the
to
the
court
of
orchids
and
was
just
about
to
go
to
prepare
herself
a
drink
and
read
a
novel
when
cowperwood
observed
you
bored
are
you
oh
no
i
used
to
lonely
evenings
she
replied
quietly
and
without
any
attempt
at
sarcasm
relentless
as
he
was
in
hewing
life
to
his
theory
hammering
substance
to
the
form
of
his
thought
yet
he
was
tender
too
in
the
manner
of
a
rainbow
dancing
over
an
abyss
for
the
moment
he
wanted
to
say
poor
girlie
you
do
have
a
hard
time
do
you
with
me
but
he
reflected
instantly
how
such
a
remark
would
be
received
he
meditated
holding
his
book
in
his
hand
above
his
knee
looking
at
the
purling
water
that
flowed
and
flowed
in
sprinkling
showers
over
the
sportive
marble
figures
of
mermaids
a
triton
and
nymphs
astride
of
fishes
you
really
not
happy
in
this
state
any
more
are
you
he
inquired
would
you
feel
any
more
comfortable
if
i
stayed
away
entirely
his
mind
had
turned
of
a
sudden
to
the
one
problem
that
was
fretting
him
and
to
the
opportunities
of
this
hour
you
would
she
replied
for
her
boredom
merely
concealed
her
unhappiness
in
no
longer
being
able
to
command
in
the
least
his
interest
or
his
sentiment
why
do
you
say
that
in
just
that
way
he
asked
because
i
know
you
would
i
know
why
you
ask
you
know
well
enough
that
it
is
anything
i
want
to
do
that
is
concerned
it
what
you
want
to
do
you
like
to
turn
me
off
like
an
old
horse
now
that
you
are
tired
of
me
and
so
you
ask
whether
i
would
feel
any
more
comfortable
what
a
liar
you
are
frank
how
really
shifty
you
are
i
do
wonder
you
a
multimillionaire
if
you
could
live
long
enough
you
would
eat
up
the
whole
world
do
you
think
for
one
moment
that
i
do
know
of
berenice
fleming
here
in
new
york
and
how
dancing
attendance
on
her
because
i
do
i
know
how
you
have
been
hanging
about
her
for
months
and
months
ever
since
we
have
been
here
and
for
long
before
you
think
she
wonderful
now
because
she
young
and
in
society
i
seen
you
in
the
waldorf
and
in
the
park
hanging
on
her
every
word
looking
at
her
with
adoring
eyes
what
a
fool
you
are
to
be
so
big
a
man
every
little
snip
if
she
has
pink
cheeks
and
a
doll
face
can
wind
you
right
around
her
finger
rita
sohlberg
did
it
stephanie
platow
did
it
florence
cochrane
did
it
cecily
haguenin
and
heaven
knows
how
many
more
that
i
never
heard
of
i
suppose
hand
still
lives
with
you
in
chicago
the
cheap
strumpet
now
it
berenice
fleming
and
her
frump
of
a
mother
from
all
i
can
learn
you
have
been
able
to
get
her
yet
because
her
mother
too
shrewd
perhaps
but
you
probably
will
in
the
end
it
is
you
so
much
as
your
money
that
they
after
pah
well
i
unhappy
enough
but
it
is
anything
you
can
remedy
any
more
whatever
you
could
do
to
make
me
unhappy
you
have
done
and
now
you
talk
of
my
being
happier
away
from
you
clever
boy
you
i
know
you
the
way
i
know
my
ten
fingers
you
do
deceive
me
at
any
time
in
any
way
any
more
i
ca
do
anything
about
it
i
ca
stop
you
from
making
a
fool
of
yourself
with
every
woman
you
meet
and
having
people
talk
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
why
for
a
woman
to
be
seen
with
you
is
enough
to
fix
her
reputation
forever
right
now
all
broadway
knows
you
running
after
berenice
fleming
her
name
will
soon
be
as
sweet
as
those
of
the
others
you
had
she
might
as
well
give
herself
to
you
if
she
ever
had
a
decent
reputation
it
gone
by
now
you
can
depend
upon
that
these
remarks
irritated
cowperwood
greatly
enraged
him
particularly
her
references
to
berenice
what
were
you
to
do
with
such
a
woman
he
thought
her
tongue
was
becoming
unbearable
her
speech
in
its
persistence
and
force
was
that
of
a
termagant
surely
surely
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
marrying
her
at
the
same
time
the
control
of
her
was
largely
in
his
own
hands
even
yet
aileen
he
said
coolly
at
the
end
of
her
speech
you
talk
too
much
you
rave
you
growing
vulgar
i
believe
now
let
me
tell
you
something
and
he
fixed
her
with
a
hard
quieting
eye
i
have
no
apologies
to
make
think
what
you
please
i
know
why
you
say
what
you
do
but
here
is
the
point
i
want
you
to
get
it
straight
and
clear
it
may
make
some

kind
of
a
woman

do
care
for
you

more
if
you
want
to
put
it
another
way
i

a
long
while

would
have
done
it

i
it
is
my
fault
that

in

it

your
fault

not

a
bunch
of
coals
that
can
be
blown
by
an
artificial
bellows
into
a
flame
at
any
time
it
out
and
that
an
end
of
it
since
i
do
love
you
and
ca

a
divorce

time

fair
and
right
to
you

give
you
this
house
these
pictures
though
i
really
do
see
what
you
want
with
them
cowperwood
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
the
gallery
if
he
could
help
it
i
settle
on
you
for
life
any
income
you
desire
or
i
give
you
a
fixed
sum
outright
i
want
to
be
free
and
i
want
you
to
let
me
be
now
why
wo
you
be
sensible
and
let
me
do
this
during
this
harangue
cowperwood
had
first
sat
and
then
stood
at
the
statement
that
his
love
was
really
dead
the
first
time
he
had
ever
baldly
and
squarely
announced
it
aileen
had
paled
a
little
and
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
over
her
eyes
it
was
then
he
had
arisen
he
was
cold
determined
a
little
revengeful
for
the
moment
she
realized
now
that
he
meant
this
that
in
his
heart
was
no
least
feeling
for
all
that
had
gone
before
no
sweet
memories
no
binding
thoughts
of
happy
hours
days
weeks
years
that
were
so
glittering
and
wonderful
to
her
in
retrospect
great
heavens
it
was
really
true
his
love
was
dead
he
had
said
it
but
for
the
nonce
she
could
not
believe
it
she
would
not
it
really
could
be
true
frank
she
began
coming
toward
him
the
while
he
moved
away
to
evade
her
her
eyes
were
wide
her
hands
trembling
her
lips
moving
in
an
emotional
wavy
rhythmic
way
you
really
do
mean
that
do
you
love
is
wholly
dead
is
it
all
the
love
you
used
to
feel
for
me
oh
frank
i
have
raged
i
have
hated
i
have
said
terrible
ugly
things
but
it
has
been
because
i
have
been
in
love
with
you
all
the
time
i
have
you
know
that
i
have
felt
so
bad
o
god
how
bad
i
have
felt
frank
you
do
know
it
but
my
pillow
has
been
wet
many
and
many
a
night
i
have
cried
and
cried
i
have
got
up
and
walked
the
floor
i
have
drunk
whisky
plain
raw
whisky
because
something
hurt
me
and
i
wanted
to
kill
the
pain
i
have
gone
with
other
men
one
after
another
you
know
that
but
oh
frank
frank
you
know
that
i
did
want
to
that
i
did
mean
to
i
have
always
despised
the
thought
of
them
afterward
it
was
only
because
i
was
lonely
and
because
you
would
pay
any
attention
to
me
or
be
nice
to
me
oh
how
i
have
longed
and
longed
for
just
one
loving
hour
with
you
one
night
one
day
there
are
women
who
could
suffer
in
silence
but
i
ca
my
mind
wo
let
me
alone
frank
my
thoughts
wo
i
ca
help
thinking
how
i
used
to
run
to
you
in
philadelphia
when
you
would
meet
me
on
your
way
home
or
when
i
used
to
come
to
you
in
ninth
street
or
on
eleventh
oh
frank
i
probably
did
wrong
to
your
first
wife
i
see
it
now
how
she
must
have
suffered
but
i
was
just
a
silly
girl
then
and
i
did
know
do
you
remember
how
i
used
to
come
to
you
in
ninth
street
and
how
i
saw
you
day
after
day
in
the
penitentiary
in
philadelphia
you
said
then
you
would
love
me
always
and
that
you
would
never
forget
ca
you
love
me
any
more
just
a
little
is
it
really
true
that
your
love
is
dead
am
i
so
old
so
changed
oh
frank
please
do
say
that
please
do
please
please
please
i
beg
of
you
she
tried
to
reach
him
and
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
but
he
stepped
aside
to
him
as
he
looked
at
her
now
she
was
the
antithesis
of
anything
he
could
brook
let
alone
desire
artistically
or
physically
the
charm
was
gone
the
spell
broken
it
was
another
type
another
point
of
view
he
required
but
above
all
and
principally
youth
youth
the
spirit
for
instance
that
was
in
berenice
fleming
he
was
sorry
in
his
way
he
felt
sympathy
but
it
was
like
the
tinkling
of
a
the
moaning
of
a
whistling
buoy
heard
over
the
thrash
of
waves
on
a
stormy
sea
you
do
understand
how
it
is
aileen
he
said
i
ca
help
myself
my
love
is
dead
it
is
gone
i
ca
recall
it
i
feel
it
i
wish
i
could
but
i
ca
you
must
understand
that
some
things
are
possible
and
some
are
not
he
looked
at
her
but
with
no
relenting
aileen
for
her
part
saw
in
his
eyes
nothing
as
she
believed
save
cold
philosophic
logic
the
man
of
business
the
thinker
the
bargainer
the
plotter
at
the
thought
of
the
adamantine
character
of
his
soul
which
could
thus
definitely
close
its
gates
on
her
for
ever
and
ever
she
became
wild
angry
feverish
not
quite
sane
oh
do
say
that
she
pleaded
foolishly
please
do
please
do
say
that
it
might
come
back
a
little
if
if
you
would
only
believe
in
it
do
you
see
how
i
feel
do
you
see
how
it
is
she
dropped
to
her
knees
and
clasped
him
about
the
waist
oh
frank
oh
frank
oh
frank
she
began
to
call
crying
i
ca
stand
it
i
ca
i
ca
i
ca
i
shall
die
do
give
way
like
that
aileen
he
pleaded
it
does
do
any
good
i
ca
lie
to
myself
i
do
want
to
lie
to
you
life
is
too
short
facts
are
facts
if
i
could
say
and
believe
that
i
loved
you
i
would
say
so
now
but
i
ca
i
do
love
you
why
should
i
say
that
i
do
in
the
content
of
aileen
nature
was
a
portion
that
was
purely
histrionic
a
portion
that
was
childish
petted
and
spoiled
a
portion
that
was
sheer
unreason
and
a
portion
that
was
splendid
emotion
deep
dark
involved
at
this
statement
of
cowperwood
which
seemed
to
throw
her
back
on
herself
for
ever
and
ever
to
be
alone
she
first
pleaded
willingness
to
compromise
to
share
she
had
not
fought
stephanie
platow
she
had
not
fought
florence
cochrane
nor
cecily
haguenin
nor
hand
nor
indeed
anybody
after
rita
and
she
would
fight
no
more
she
had
not
spied
on
him
in
connection
with
berenice
she
had
accidentally
met
them
true
she
had
gone
with
other
men
but
berenice
was
beautiful
she
admitted
it
but
so
was
she
in
her
way
still
a
little
still
could
he
find
a
place
for
her
yet
in
his
life
was
there
room
for
both
at
this
expression
of
humiliation
and
defeat
cowperwood
was
sad
sick
almost
nauseated
how
could
one
argue
how
make
her
understand
i
wish
it
were
possible
aileen
he
concluded
finally
and
heavily
but
it
is
all
at
once
she
arose
her
eyes
red
but
dry
you
do
love
me
then
at
all
do
you
not
a
bit
no
aileen
i
do
i
do
mean
by
that
that
i
dislike
you
i
mean
to
say
that
you
are
interesting
in
your
way
as
a
woman
and
that
i
do
sympathize
with
you
i
do
but
i
do
love
you
any
more
i
ca
the
thing
i
used
to
feel
i
ca
feel
any
more
she
paused
for
a
moment
uncertain
how
to
take
this
the
while
she
whitened
grew
more
tense
more
spiritual
than
she
had
been
in
many
a
day
now
she
felt
desperate
angry
sick
but
like
the
scorpion
that
ringed
by
fire
can
turn
only
on
itself
what
a
hell
life
was
she
told
herself
how
it
slipped
away
and
left
one
aging
horribly
alone
love
was
nothing
faith
nothing
nothing
nothing
a
fine
light
of
conviction
intensity
intention
lit
her
eye
for
the
moment
very
well
then
she
said
coolly
tensely
i
know
what
i
do
i
not
live
this
way
i
not
live
beyond
i
want
to
die
anyhow
and
i
will
it
was
by
no
means
a
cry
this
last
but
a
calm
statement
it
should
prove
her
love
to
cowperwood
it
seemed
unreal
bravado
a
momentary
rage
intended
to
frighten
him
she
turned
and
walked
up
the
grand
staircase
which
was
near
a
splendid
piece
of
marble
and
bronze
fifteen
feet
wide
with
marble
nereids
for
and
dancing
figures
worked
into
the
stone
she
went
into
her
room
quite
calmly
and
took
up
a
steel
of
dagger
design
a
knife
with
a
handle
of
bronze
and
a
point
of
great
sharpness
coming
out
and
going
along
the
balcony
over
the
court
of
orchids
where
cowperwood
still
was
seated
she
entered
the
sunrise
room
with
its
pool
of
water
its
birds
its
benches
its
vines
locking
the
door
she
sat
down
and
then
suddenly
baring
an
arm
jabbed
a
vein
ripped
it
for
inches
and
sat
there
to
bleed
now
she
would
see
whether
she
could
die
whether
he
would
let
her
uncertain
astonished
not
able
to
believe
that
she
could
be
so
rash
not
believing
that
her
feeling
could
be
so
great
cowperwood
still
remained
where
she
had
left
him
wondering
he
had
not
been
so
greatly
moved
the
tantrums
of
women
were
common
and
yet
could
she
really
be
contemplating
death
how
could
she
how
ridiculous
life
was
so
strange
so
mad
but
this
was
aileen
who
had
just
made
this
threat
and
she
had
gone
up
the
stairs
to
carry
it
out
perhaps
impossible
how
could
it
be
yet
back
of
all
his
doubts
there
was
a
kind
of
sickening
feeling
a
dread
he
recalled
how
she
had
assaulted
rita
sohlberg
he
hurried
up
the
steps
now
and
into
her
room
she
was
not
there
he
went
quickly
along
the
balcony
looking
here
and
there
until
he
came
to
the
sunrise
room
she
must
be
there
for
the
door
was
shut
he
tried
it
it
was
locked
aileen
he
called
aileen
are
you
in
there
no
answer
he
listened
still
no
answer
aileen
he
repeated
are
you
in
there
what
damned
nonsense
is
this
anyhow
george
he
thought
to
himself
stepping
back
she
might
do
it
too
perhaps
she
has
he
could
not
hear
anything
save
the
odd
chattering
of
a
toucan
aroused
by
the
light
she
had
switched
on
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
brow
he
shook
the
knob
pushed
a
bell
for
a
servant
called
for
keys
which
had
been
made
for
every
door
called
for
a
chisel
and
hammer
aileen
he
said
if
you
do
open
the
door
this
instant
i
will
see
that
it
is
opened
it
can
be
opened
quick
enough
still
no
sound
damn
it
he
exclaimed
becoming
wretched
horrified
a
servant
brought
the
keys
the
right
one
would
not
enter
a
second
was
on
the
other
side
there
is
a
bigger
hammer
somewhere
cowperwood
said
get
it
get
me
a
chair
meantime
with
terrific
energy
using
a
large
chisel
he
forced
the
door
there
on
one
of
the
stone
benches
of
the
lovely
room
sat
aileen
the
level
pool
of
water
before
her
the
sunrise
glow
over
every
thing
tropic
birds
in
their
branches
and
she
her
hair
disheveled
her
face
pale
one
arm
her
left
hanging
down
ripped
and
bleeding
trickling
a
thick
stream
of
rich
red
blood
on
the
floor
was
a
pool
of
blood
fierce
scarlet
like
some
rich
cloth
already
turning
darker
in
places
cowperwood
paused
amazed
he
hurried
forward
seized
her
arm
made
a
bandage
of
a
torn
handkerchief
above
the
wound
sent
for
a
surgeon
saying
the
while
how
could
you
aileen
how
impossible
to
try
to
take
your
life
this
is
love
it
is
even
madness
it
foolish
acting
do
you
really
care
she
asked
how
can
you
ask
how
could
you
really
do
this
he
was
angry
hurt
glad
that
she
was
alive
shamed
many
things
do
you
really
care
she
repeated
wearily
aileen
this
is
nonsense
i
will
not
talk
to
you
about
it
now
have
you
cut
yourself
anywhere
else
he
asked
feeling
about
her
bosom
and
sides
then
why
not
let
me
die
she
replied
in
the
same
manner
i
will
some
day
i
want
to
well
you
may
some
day
he
replied
but
not
i
scarcely
think
you
want
to
now
this
is
too
much
aileen
really
impossible
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
at
her
cool
unbelieving
the
light
of
control
even
of
victory
in
his
eyes
as
he
had
suspected
it
was
not
truly
real
she
would
not
have
killed
herself
she
had
expected
him
to
come
to
make
the
old
effort
very
good
he
would
see
her
safely
in
bed
and
in
a
nurse
hands
and
would
then
avoid
her
as
much
as
possible
in
the
future
if
her
intention
was
genuine
she
would
carry
it
out
in
his
absence
but
he
did
not
believe
she
would

battle
between

cowperwood

forces

in
so
far
as
the
city
of

the
state

indeed
the

of
america
were
concerned
when
in
a
new
governor
and
a
new
group
of
state
representatives
were
installed
cowperwood
decided
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
continue
the
struggle
at
once
by
the
time
this
new
legislature
should
convene
for
its
labors

aroused
by

have
had

to

interests

curious
mixture
of
the
commonplace
and
the
ideal

of
those
shiftily
loyal
and
loyally
shifty
who
make
their
upward

because
of
presence
force
he
was
by
nature
materially
and
commercially
minded
therefore
without
basic
appeal
to
the
higher
ranks
of
intelligence
in
seeking
the
nomination
for
governorship
he
had
made
the
usual
overtures
and
had
in
turn
been
sounded
by
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
and
various
other
corporate
interests
who
were
in
league
with
cowperwood
as
to
his
attitude
in
regard
to
a
proposed
commission
at
first
he
had
refused
to
commit
himself
later
finding
that
the
and
the
chicago
pacific
very
powerful
railroads
both
were
interested
and
that
other
candidates
were
running
him
a
tight
chase
in
the
gubernatorial
contest
he
succumbed
in
a
measure
declaring
privately
that
in
case
the
legislature
proved
to
be
strongly
in
favor
of
the
idea
and
the
newspapers
not
too
crushingly
opposed
he
might
be
willing
to
stand
as
its
advocate
other
candidates
expressed
similar
views
but
corporal
archer
proved
to
have
the
greater
following
and
was
eventually
nominated
and
comfortably
elected
shortly
after
the
new
legislature
had
convened
it
so
chanced
that
a
certain
rotherhite
publisher
of
the
south
chicago
journal
was
one
day
accidentally
sitting
as
a
visitor
in
the
seat
of
a
state
representative
by
the
name
of
clarence
mulligan
while
so
occupied
rotherhite
was
familiarly
slapped
on
the
back
by
a
certain
senator
ladrigo
of
menard
and
was
invited
to
come
out
into
the
rotunda
where
posing
as
representative
mulligan
he
was
introduced
by
senator
ladrigo
to
a
stranger
by
the
name
of
gerard
the
latter
with
but
few
preliminary
remarks
began
as
follows
mulligan
i
want
to
fix
it
with
you
in
regard
to
this
southack
bill
which
is
soon
to
come
up
in
the
house
we
have
seventy
votes
but
we
want
ninety
the
fact
that
the
bill
has
gone
to
a
second
reading
in
the
senate
shows
our
strength
i
am
authorized
to
come
to
terms
with
you
this
morning
if
you
would
like
your
vote
is
worth
two
thousand
dollars
to
you
the
moment
the
bill
is
signed
rotherhite
who
happened
to
be
a
newly
recruited
member
of
the
opposition
press
proved
very
canny
in
this
situation
excuse
me
he
stammered
i
did
not
understand
your
name
gerard
henry
gerard
replied
this
other
thank
you
i
will
think
it
over
was
the
response
of
the
presumed
representative
mulligan
strange
to
state
at
this
very
instant
the
authentic
mulligan
actually
appeared
heralded
aloud
by
several
of
his
colleagues
who
happened
to
be
lingering
near
by
in
the
lobby
whereupon
the
anomalous
gerard
and
the
crafty
senator
ladrigo
discreetly
withdrew
needless
to
say
that
rotherhite
hurried
at
once
to
the
forces
of
righteousness
the
press
should
spread
this
little
story
broadcast
it
was
a
very
meaty
incident
and
it
brought
the
whole
matter
once
more
into
the
fatal
poisonous
field
of
press
discussion
at
once
the
chicago
papers
flew
to
arms
the
cry
was
raised
that
the
same
old
sinister
cowperwoodian
forces
were
at
work
the
members
of
the
senate
and
the
house
were
solemnly
warned
the
sterling
attitude
of
swanson
was
held
up
as
an
example
to
the
present
governor
archer
the
whole
idea
observed
an
editorial
in
truman
leslie
macdonald
inquirer
smacks
of
chicane
political
subtlety
and
political
jugglery
well
do
the
citizens
of
chicago
and
the
people
of
illinois
know
who
and
what
particular
organization
would
prove
the
true
beneficiaries
we
do
not
want
a
commission
at
the
behest
of
a
private
corporation
are
the
tentacles
of
frank
cowperwood
to
envelop
this
legislature
as
they
did
the
last
this
broadside
coming
in
conjunction
with
various
hostile
rumblings
in
other
papers
aroused
cowperwood
to
emphatic
language
they
can
all
go
to
the
devil
he
said
to
addison
one
day
at
lunch
i
have
a
right
to
an
extension
of
my
franchises
for
fifty
years
and
i
am
going
to
get
it
look
at
new
york
and
philadelphia
why
the
eastern
houses
laugh
they
do
understand
such
a
situation
all
the
inside
work
of
this
crowd
i
know
what
doing
and
who
pulling
the
strings
the
newspapers
every
time
they
give
an
order
hyssop
waltzes
every
time
arneel
moves
little
macdonald
is
a
for
hand
it
got
down
so
low
now
that
it
anything
to
beat
cowperwood
well
they
wo
beat
me
i
find
a
way
out
the
legislature
will
pass
a
bill
allowing
for
a
franchise
and
the
governor
will
sign
it
i
see
to
that
personally
i
have
at
least
eighteen
thousand
stockholders
who
want
a
decent
run
for
their
money
and
i
propose
to
give
it
to
them
are
other
men
getting
rich
are
other
corporations
earning
ten
and
twelve
per
cent
why
should
i
is
chicago
any
the
worse
do
i
employ
twenty
thousand
men
and
pay
them
well
all
this
palaver
about
the
rights
of
the
people
and
the
duty
to
the
public
rats
does
hand
acknowledge
any
duty
to
the
public
where
his
special
interests
are
concerned
or
schryhart
or
arneel
the
newspapers
be
damned
i
know
my
rights
an
honest
legislature
will
give
me
a
decent
franchise
to
save
me
from
the
local
political
sharks
by
this
time
however
the
newspapers
had
become
as
subtle
and
powerful
as
the
politicians
themselves
under
the
great
dome
of
the
capitol
at
springfield
in
the
halls
and
conference
chambers
of
the
senate
and
house
in
the
hotels
and
in
the
rural
districts
wherever
any
least
information
was
to
be
gathered
were
their
representatives
to
see
to
listen
to
pry
out
of
this
contest
they
were
gaining
prestige
and
cash
by
them
were
the
reform
aldermen
persuaded
to
call
in
their
respective
districts
were
urged
to
organize
a
committee
of
one
hundred
prominent
citizens
led
by
hand
and
schryhart
was
formed
it
was
not
long
before
the
halls
chambers
and
of
the
capitol
at
springfield
and
the
corridors
of
the
one
principal
hotel
were
being
tramped
over
almost
daily
by
rampant
delegations
of
ministers
reform
aldermen
and
civil
committeemen
who
arrived
speechifying
threatening
and
haranguing
and
departed
only
to
make
room
for
another
relay
say
what
do
you
think
of
these
delegations
senator
inquired
a
certain
representative
greenough
of
senator
george
christian
of
grundy
one
morning
the
while
a
group
of
chicago
clergymen
accompanied
by
the
mayor
and
several
distinguished
private
citizens
passed
through
the
rotunda
on
their
way
to
the
committee
on
railroads
where
the
house
bill
was
privily
being
discussed
do
you
think
they
speak
well
for
our
civic
pride
and
moral
upbringing
he
raised
his
eyes
and
crossed
his
fingers
over
his
waistcoat
in
the
most
sanctimonious
and
reverential
attitude
yes
dear
pastor
replied
the
irreverent
christian
without
the
shadow
of
a
smile
he
was
a
little
sallow
wiry
man
with
eyes
like
a
ferret
a
small
mustache
and
goatee
ornamenting
his
face
but
do
not
forget
that
the
lord
has
called
us
also
to
this
work
even
so
acquiesced
greenough
we
must
not
weary
in
well
doing
the
harvest
is
truly
plenteous
and
the
laborers
are
few
tut
tut
pastor
do
overdo
it
you
might
make
me
larf
replied
christian
and
the
twain
parted
with
knowing
and
yet
weary
smiles
yet
how
little
did
the
accommodating
attitude
of
these
gentlemen
avail
in
silencing
the
newspapers
the
damnable
newspapers
they
were
here
there
and
everywhere
reporting
each
least
fragment
of
rumor
conversation
or
imaginary
programme
never
did
the
citizens
of
chicago
receive
so
keen
a
drilling
in
statecraft
its
subtleties
and
ramifications
the
president
of
the
senate
and
the
speaker
of
the
house
were
singled
out
and
warned
separately
as
to
their
duty
a
page
a
day
devoted
to
legislative
proceeding
in
this
quarter
was
practically
the
custom
of
the
situation
cowperwood
was
here
personally
on
the
scene
brazen
defiant
logical
the
courage
of
his
convictions
in
his
eyes
the
power
of
his
magnetism
fairly
enslaving
men
throwing
off
the
mask
of
disinterestedness
if
any
might
be
said
to
have
covered
him
he
now
frankly
came
out
in
the
open
and
journeying
to
springfield
took
quarters
at
the
principal
hotel
like
a
general
in
time
of
battle
he
marshaled
his
forces
about
him
in
the
warm
moonlit
atmosphere
of
june
nights
when
the
streets
of
springfield
were
quiet
the
great
plain
of
illinois
bathed
for
hundreds
of
miles
from
north
to
south
in
a
sweet
effulgence
and
the
rurals
slumbering
in
their
simple
homes
he
sat
conferring
with
his
lawyers
and
legislative
agents
pity
in
such
a
crisis
the
poor
legislator
torn
between
his
desire
for
a
justifiable
and
expedient
gain
and
his
fear
lest
he
should
be
assailed
as
a
betrayer
of
the
people
interests
to
some
of
these
legislators
who
had
never
seen
as
much
as
two
thousand
dollars
in
cash
in
all
their
days
the
problem
was
men
gathered
in
private
rooms
and
hotel
parlors
to
discuss
it
they
stood
in
their
rooms
at
night
and
thought
about
it
alone
the
sight
of
big
business
compelling
its
desires
the
while
the
people
went
begging
was
destructive
many
a
romantic
illusioned
idealistic
young
country
editor
lawyer
or
statesman
was
here
made
over
into
a
minor
cynic
or
men
were
robbed
of
every
vestige
of
faith
or
even
of
charity
they
came
to
feel
perforce
that
there
was
nothing
outside
the
capacity
for
taking
and
keeping
the
surface
might
appear
commonplace
ordinary
men
of
the
state
of
illinois
going
here
and
there
simple
farmers
and
senators
and
representatives
conferring
and
meditating
and
wondering
what
they
could
do
yet
a
complexity
was
present
a
dark
rank
growth
of
horrific
but
avid
life
life
at
the
full
life
knife
in
hand
life
blazing
with
courage
and
dripping
at
the
jaws
with
hunger
however
because
of
the
terrific
uproar
the
more
cautious
legislators
were
by
degrees
becoming
fearful
friends
in
their
home
towns
at
the
instigation
of
the
papers
were
beginning
to
write
them
political
enemies
were
taking
heart
it
meant
too
much
of
a
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
everybody
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
bait
was
apparently
within
easy
reach
many
became
evasive
and
disturbed
when
a
certain
representative
sparks
cocked
and
primed
with
the
bill
in
his
pocket
arose
upon
the
floor
of
the
house
asking
leave
to
have
it
spread
upon
the
minutes
there
was
an
instant
explosion
the
privilege
of
the
floor
was
requested
by
a
hundred
another
representative
disback
being
in
charge
of
the
opposition
to
cowperwood
had
made
a
count
of
noses
and
was
satisfied
in
spite
of
all
subtlety
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
that
he
had
at
least
one
hundred
and
two
votes
the
necessary
wherewith
to
crush
any
measure
which
might
originate
on
the
floor
nevertheless
his
followers
because
of
caution
voted
it
to
a
second
and
a
third
reading
all
sorts
of
amendments
were
made
one
for
a
fare
during
the
another
for
a
per
cent
tax
on
gross
receipts
in
amended
form
the
measure
was
sent
to
the
senate
where
the
changes
were
stricken
out
and
the
bill
once
more
returned
to
the
house
here
to
cowperwood
chagrin
signs
were
made
manifest
that
it
could
not
be
passed
it
ca
be
done
frank
said
judge
dickensheets
it
too
grilling
a
game
their
home
papers
are
after
them
they
ca
live
consequently
a
second
measure
was
devised
more
soothing
and
lulling
to
the
newspapers
but
far
less
satisfactory
to
cowperwood
it
conferred
upon
the
chicago
city
council
by
a
trick
of
revising
the
old
horse
and
dummy
act
of
the
right
to
grant
a
franchise
for
fifty
instead
of
for
twenty
years
this
meant
that
cowperwood
would
have
to
return
to
chicago
and
fight
out
his
battle
there
it
was
a
severe
blow
yet
better
than
nothing
providing
that
he
could
win
one
more
franchise
battle
within
the
walls
of
the
city
council
in
chicago
it
would
give
him
all
that
he
desired
but
could
he
had
he
not
come
here
to
the
legislature
especially
to
evade
such
a
risk
his
motives
were
enduring
such
a
blistering
exposure
yet
perhaps
after
all
if
the
price
were
large
enough
the
chicago
councilmen
would
have
more
real
courage
than
these
country
legislators
would
dare
more
they
would
have
to
so
after
heaven
knows
what
desperate
whisperings
conferences
arguments
and
heartening
of
members
there
was
originated
a
second
measure
which
after
the
defeat
of
the
first
bill
to
was
introduced
by
way
of
a
very
complicated
path
through
the
judiciary
committee
it
was
passed
and
governor
archer
after
heavy
hours
of
contemplation
and
signed
it
a
little
man
mentally
he
failed
to
estimate
an
aroused
popular
fury
at
its
true
import
to
him
at
his
elbow
was
cowperwood
in
the
clear
light
of
day
snapping
his
fingers
in
the
face
of
his
enemies
showing
by
the
hard
cheerful
glint
in
his
eye
that
he
was
still
master
of
the
situation
giving
all
assurance
that
he
would
yet
live
to
whip
the
chicago
papers
into
submission
besides
in
the
event
of
the
passage
of
the
bill
cowperwood
had
promised
to
make
archer
independently
rich
a
cash
reward
of
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
chapter
lix
capital
and
public
rights
between
the
passage
on
june
of
the
mears
bill
so
christened
after
the
doughty
representative
who
had
received
a
small
fortune
for
introducing
it
and
its
presentation
to
the
chicago
city
council
in
december
of
the
same
year
what
broodings
plottings
politickings
and
editorializings
on
the
part
of
all
and
sundry
in
spite
of
the
intense
feeling
of
opposition
to
cowperwood
there
was
at
the
same
time
in
local
public
life
one
stratum
of
commercial
and
phlegmatic
substance
that
could
not
view
him
in
an
altogether
unfavorable
light
they
were
in
business
themselves
his
lines
passed
their
doors
and
served
them
they
could
not
see
wherein
his
service
differed
so
much
from
that
which
others
might
give
here
was
the
type
of
materialist
who
in
cowperwood
defiance
saw
a
justification
of
his
own
material
point
of
view
and
was
not
afraid
to
say
so
but
as
against
these
there
were
the
preachers
poor
sticks
of
unreason
who
saw
only
what
the
current
palaver
seemed
to
indicate
again
there
were
the
anarchists
socialists
and
advocates
there
were
the
very
poor
who
saw
in
cowperwood
wealth
and
in
the
fabulous
stories
of
his
new
york
home
and
of
his
a
heartless
exploitation
of
their
needs
at
this
time
the
feeling
was
spreading
broadcast
in
america
that
great
political
and
economic
changes
were
at
hand
that
the
tyranny
of
iron
masters
at
the
top
was
to
give
way
to
a
richer
freer
happier
life
for
the
rank
and
file
a
national
law
was
being
advocated
and
the
public
ownership
of
public
franchises
and
here
now
was
a
great
corporation
serving
a
population
of
a
million
and
a
half
occupying
streets
which
the
people
themselves
created
by
their
presence
taking
toll
from
all
these
humble
citizens
to
the
amount
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
millions
of
dollars
in
the
year
and
giving
in
return
so
the
papers
said
poor
service
shabby
cars
no
seats
at
no
universal
transfers
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
in
operation
three
hundred
and
separate
transfer
points
and
no
adequate
tax
on
the
immense
sums
earned
the
workingman
who
read
this
by
gas
or
lamp
light
in
the
kitchen
or
parlor
of
his
shabby
flat
or
cottage
and
who
read
also
in
other
sections
of
his
paper
of
the
free
reckless
glorious
lives
of
the
rich
felt
himself
to
be
defrauded
of
a
portion
of
his
rightful
inheritance
it
was
all
a
question
of
compelling
frank
cowperwood
to
do
his
duty
by
chicago
he
must
not
again
be
allowed
to
bribe
the
aldermen
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
franchise
the
privilege
of
granting
which
he
had
already
bought
from
the
state
legislature
by
the
degradation
of
honest
men
he
must
be
made
to
succumb
to
yield
to
the
forces
of
law
and
order
it
was
claimed
and
with
a
justice
of
which
those
who
made
the
charge
were
by
no
means
fully
aware
that
the
mears
bill
had
been
put
through
the
house
and
senate
by
the
use
of
cold
cash
proffered
even
to
the
governor
himself
no
legal
proof
of
this
was
obtainable
but
cowperwood
was
assumed
to
be
a
briber
on
a
giant
scale
by
the
newspaper
cartoons
he
was
represented
as
a
pirate
commander
ordering
his
men
to
scuttle
another
vessel
the
ship
of
public
rights
he
was
pictured
as
a
thief
a
black
mask
over
his
eyes
and
as
a
seducer
throttling
chicago
the
fair
maiden
while
he
stole
her
purse
the
fame
of
this
battle
was
by
now
becoming
in
montreal
in
cape
town
in
buenos
ayres
and
melbourne
in
london
and
paris
men
were
reading
of
this
singular
struggle
at
last
and
truly
he
was
a
national
and
international
figure
his
original
dream
however
modified
by
circumstances
had
literally
been
fulfilled
meanwhile
be
it
admitted
that
the
local
elements
in
finance
which
had
brought
about
this
terrific
onslaught
on
cowperwood
were
not
a
little
disturbed
as
to
the
eventual
character
of
the
child
of
their
own
creation
here
at
last
was
a
public
opinion
definitely
inimical
to
cowperwood
but
here
also
were
they
themselves
tremendous
with
a
desire
for
just
such
favors
as
cowperwood
himself
had
exacted
deliberately
setting
out
to
kill
the
goose
that
could
lay
the
golden
egg
men
such
as
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
fishel
tremendous
capitalists
in
the
east
and
foremost
in
the
directorates
of
huge
transcontinental
lines
international
and
the
like
were
amazed
that
the
newspapers
and
the
element
should
have
gone
so
far
in
chicago
had
they
no
respect
for
capital
did
they
not
know
that
franchises
were
practically
the
basis
of
all
modern
capitalistic
prosperity
such
theories
as
were
now
being
advocated
here
would
spread
to
other
cities
unless
checked
america
might
readily
become
socialistic
public
ownership
might
appear
as
a
workable
theory
and
then
what
those
men
out
there
are
very
foolish
observed
haeckelheimer
at
one
time
to
fishel
of
fishel
stone
symons
i
ca
see
that
cowperwood
is
different
from
any
other
organizer
of
his
day
he
seems
to
me
perfectly
sound
and
able
all
his
companies
pay
there
are
no
better
investments
than
the
north
and
west
chicago
railways
it
would
be
advisable
in
my
judgment
that
all
the
lines
out
there
should
be
consolidated
and
be
put
in
his
charge
he
would
make
money
for
the
stockholders
he
seems
to
know
how
to
run
you
know
replied
fishel
as
smug
and
white
as
haeckelheimer
and
in
thorough
sympathy
with
his
point
of
view
i
have
been
thinking
of
something
like
that
myself
all
this
quarreling
should
be
hushed
up
it
very
bad
for
business
very
once
they
get
that
nonsense
started
it
will
be
hard
to
stop
there
has
been
too
much
of
it
already
fishel
was
stout
and
round
like
haeckelheimer
but
much
smaller
he
was
little
more
than
a
walking
mathematical
formula
in
his
cranium
were
financial
theorems
and
syllogisms
of
the
second
third
and
fourth
power
only
and
now
behold
a
new
trend
of
affairs
timothy
arneel
attacked
by
pneumonia
dies
and
leaves
his
holdings
in
chicago
city
to
his
eldest
son
edward
arneel
fishel
and
haeckelheimer
through
agents
and
then
direct
approach
merrill
in
behalf
of
cowperwood
there
is
much
talk
of
profits
how
much
more
profitable
has
been
the
cowperwood
regime
over
lines
than
that
of
schryhart
fishel
is
interested
in
allaying
socialistic
excitement
so
by
this
time
is
merrill
directly
hereafter
haeckelheimer
approaches
edward
arneel
who
is
not
nearly
so
forceful
as
his
father
though
he
would
like
to
be
so
he
strange
to
relate
has
come
rather
to
admire
cowperwood
and
sees
no
advantage
in
a
policy
that
can
only
tend
to
municipalize
local
lines
merrill
for
fishel
approaches
hand
never
never
never
says
hand
haeckelheimer
approaches
hand
never
never
never
to
the
devil
with
mr
cowperwood
but
as
a
final
emissary
for
haeckelheimer
and
fishel
there
now
appears
morgan
frankhauser
the
partner
of
hand
in
a
traction
scheme
in
minneapolis
and
paul
why
will
hand
be
so
persistent
why
pursue
a
scheme
of
revenge
which
only
stirs
up
the
masses
and
makes
municipal
ownership
a
valid
political
idea
thus
disturbing
capital
elsewhere
why
not
trade
his
chicago
holdings
to
him
frankhauser
for
pittsburg
traction
stock
share
and
share
alike
and
then
fight
cowperwood
all
he
pleases
on
the
outside
hand
puzzled
astounded
scratching
his
round
head
slaps
a
heavy
hand
on
his
desk
never
he
exclaims
never
by
god
as
long
as
i
am
alive
and
in
chicago
and
then
he
yields
life
does
shifty
things
he
is
forced
to
reflect
in
a
most
puzzled
way
never
would
he
have
believed
it
schryhart
he
declared
to
frankhauser
will
never
come
in
he
will
die
first
poor
old
timothy
if
he
were
alive
he
would
either
leave
schryhart
out
of
it
for
heaven
sake
pleaded
frankhauser
a
genial
american
german
have
i
troubles
enough
schryhart
is
enraged
never
never
never
he
will
sell
out
first
but
he
is
in
a
minority
and
frankhauser
for
fishel
or
haeckelheimer
will
gladly
take

so
in
the
mayor
chair
of
chicago
at
this
time
sat
a
man
named
walden
lucas
aged
he
was
politically
ambitious
he
had
the
elements
of
popularity
the
knack
or
luck
of
fixing
public
attention
a
fine
upstanding
healthy
young
buck
he
was
subtle
vigorous
a
cool
direct
practical
thinker
and
speaker
an
eager
enigmatic
dreamer
of
great
political
honors
to
come
anxious
to
play
his
cards
just
right
to
make
friends
to
be
the
pride
of
the
righteous
and
yet
the
not
too
uncompromising
foe
of
the
wicked
in
short
a
youthful
hopeful
western
machiavelli
and
one
who
could
if
he
chose
serve
the
cause
of
the
struggle
exceedingly
well
indeed
cowperwood
disturbed
visits
the
mayor
in
his
office
lucas
what
is
it
you
personally
want
what
can
i
do
for
you
is
it
future
political
preferment
you
are
after
cowperwood
there
is
anything
you
can
do
for
me
you
do
not
understand
me
and
i
do
not
understand
you
you
can
not
understand
me
because
i
am
an
honest
man
ye
gods
replied
cowperwood
this
is
certainly
a
case
of
and
great
knowledge
good
afternoon
shortly
thereafter
the
mayor
was
approached
by
one
carker
who
was
the
shrewd
cold
and
yet
magnetic
leader
of
democracy
in
the
state
of
new
york
said
carker
you
see
lucas
the
great
money
houses
of
the
east
are
interested
in
this
local
contest
here
in
chicago
for
example
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
would
like
to
see
a
consolidation
of
all
the
lines
on
a
basis
that
will
make
them
an
attractive
investment
for
buyers
generally
and
will
at
the
same
time
be
fair
and
right
to
the
city
a
contract
is
much
too
short
a
term
in
their
eyes
fifty
is
the
least
they
could
comfortably
contemplate
and
they
would
prefer
a
hundred
it
is
little
enough
for
so
great
an
outlay
the
policy
now
being
pursued
here
can
lead
only
to
the
public
ownership
of
public
utilities
and
that
is
something
which
the
national
democratic
party
at
large
can
certainly
not
afford
to
advocate
at
present
it
would
antagonize
the
money
element
from
coast
to
coast
any
man
whose
political
record
was
definitely
identified
with
such
a
movement
would
have
no
possible
chance
at
even
a
state
nomination
let
alone
a
national
one
he
could
never
be
elected
i
make
myself
clear
do
i
not
you
do
a
man
can
just
as
easily
be
taken
from
the
mayor
office
in
chicago
as
from
the
governor
office
at
springfield
pursued
carker
haeckelheimer
and
fishel
have
personally
asked
me
to
call
on
you
if
you
want
to
be
mayor
of
chicago
again
for
two
years
or
governor
next
year
until
the
time
for
picking
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
arrives
suit
yourself
in
the
mean
time
you
will
be
unwise
in
my
judgment
to
saddle
yourself
with
this
idea
the
newspapers
in
fighting
cowperwood
have
raised
an
issue
which
never
should
have
been
raised
after
carker
departure
arrived
edward
arneel
of
local
renown
and
then
jacob
bethal
the
democratic
leader
in
san
francisco
both
offering
suggestions
which
if
followed
might
result
in
mutual
support
there
were
in
addition
delegations
of
powerful
republicans
from
minneapolis
and
from
philadelphia
even
the
president
of
the
lake
city
bank
and
the
president
of
the
prairie
national
once
arrived
to
say
what
had
already
been
said
so
it
went
lucas
was
greatly
nonplussed
a
political
career
was
surely
a
difficult
thing
to
effect
would
it
pay
to
harry
cowperwood
as
he
had
set
out
to
do
would
a
steadfast
policy
advocating
the
cause
of
the
people
get
him
anywhere
would
they
be
grateful
would
they
remember
suppose
the
current
policy
of
the
newspapers
should
be
modified
as
carker
had
suggested
that
it
might
be
what
a
mess
and
tangle
politics
really
were
well
bessie
he
inquired
of
his
handsome
healthy
wife
one
evening
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
i
she
was
gay
practical
vain
substantially
connected
in
so
far
as
family
went
and
proud
of
her
husband
position
and
future
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
talking
over
his
various
difficulties
with
her
well
i
tell
you
wally
she
replied
you
got
to
stick
to
something
it
looks
to
me
as
though
the
winning
side
was
with
the
people
this
time
i
do
see
how
the
newspapers
can
change
now
after
all
they
done
you
do
have
to
advocate
public
ownership
or
anything
unfair
to
the
money
element
but
just
the
same
i
stick
to
my
point
that
the
franchise
is
too
much
you
ought
to
make
them
pay
the
city
something
and
get
their
franchise
without
bribery
they
ca
do
less
than
that
i
stick
to
the
course
you
begun
on
you
ca
get
along
without
the
people
wally
you
just
must
have
them
if
you
lose
their
good
will
the
politicians
ca
help
you
much
nor
anybody
else
plainly
there
were
times
when
the
people
had
to
be
considered
they
just
had
to
be
chapter

the
net
the
storm
which
burst
in
connection
with
cowperwood
machinations
at
springfield
early
in
and
continued
without
abating
until
the
following
fall
attracted
such
general
attention
that
it
was
largely
reported
in
the
eastern
papers
cowperwood
versus
the
state
of
illinois
thus
one
new
york
daily
phrased
the
situation
the
magnetizing
power
of
fame
is
great
who
can
resist
utterly
the
luster
that
surrounds
the
individualities
of
some
men
causing
them
to
glow
with
a
separate
and
special
effulgence
even
in
the
case
of
berenice
this
was
not
without
its
value
in
a
chicago
paper
which
she
found
lying
one
day
on
a
desk
which
cowperwood
had
occupied
was
an
extended
editorial
which
interested
her
greatly
after
reciting
his
various
misdeeds
particularly
in
connection
with
the
present
state
legislature
it
went
on
to
say
he
has
an
innate
chronic
unconquerable
contempt
for
the
rank
and
file
men
are
but
slaves
and
thralls
to
draw
for
him
the
chariot
of
his
greatness
never
in
all
his
history
has
he
seen
fit
to
go
to
the
people
direct
for
anything
in
philadelphia
when
he
wanted
control
he
sought
privily
and
by
chicane
to
arrange
his
affairs
with
a
venal
city
treasurer
in
chicago
he
has
uniformly
sought
to
buy
and
convert
to
his
own
use
the
splendid
privileges
of
the
city
which
should
really
redound
to
the
benefit
of
all
frank
algernon
cowperwood
does
not
believe
in
the
people
he
does
not
trust
them
to
him
they
constitute
no
more
than
a
field
upon
which
corn
is
to
be
sown
and
from
which
it
is
to
be
reaped
they
present
but
a
mass
of
bent
backs
their
knees
and
faces
in
the
mire
over
which
as
over
a
floor
he
strides
to
superiority
his
private
and
inmost
faith
is
in
himself
alone
upon
the
majority
he
shuts
the
gates
of
his
glory
in
order
that
the
sight
of
their
misery
and
their
needs
may
not
disturb
nor
alloy
his
selfish
bliss
frank
algernon
cowperwood
does
not
believe
in
the
people
this
editorial
flung
aloft
during
the
latter
days
of
the
contest
at
springfield
and
taken
up
by
the
chicago
papers
generally
and
by
those
elsewhere
interested
berenice
greatly
as
she
thought
of
him
waging
his
terrific
contests
hurrying
to
and
fro
between
new
york
and
chicago
building
his
splendid
mansion
collecting
his
pictures
quarreling
with
aileen
he
came
by
degrees
to
take
on
the
outlines
of
a
superman
a
or
how
could
the
ordinary
rules
of
life
or
the
accustomed
paths
of
men
be
expected
to
control
him
they
could
not
and
did
not
and
here
he
was
pursuing
her
seeking
her
out
with
his
eyes
grateful
for
a
smile
waiting
as
much
as
he
dared
on
her
every
wish
and
whim
say
what
one
will
the
wish
buried
deep
in
every
woman
heart
is
that
her
lover
should
be
a
hero
some
out
of
the
veriest
stick
or
stone
fashion
the
idol
before
which
they
kneel
others
demand
the
hard
reality
of
greatness
but
in
either
case
the
illusion
of
is
maintained
berenice
by
no
means
ready
to
look
upon
cowperwood
as
an
accepted
lover
was
nevertheless
gratified
that
his
erring
devotion
was
the
tribute
of
one
able
apparently
to
command
thought
from
the
whole
world
moreover
because
the
new
york
papers
had
taken
fire
from
his
great
struggle
in
the
middle
west
and
were
charging
him
with
bribery
perjury
and
intent
to
thwart
the
will
of
the
people
cowperwood
now
came
forward
with
an
attempt
to
explain
his
exact
position
to
berenice
and
to
justify
himself
in
her
eyes
during
visits
to
the
carter
house
or
in
at
the
opera
or
the
theater
he
recounted
to
her
bit
by
bit
his
entire
history
he
described
the
characters
of
hand
schryhart
arneel
and
the
motives
of
jealousy
and
revenge
which
had
led
to
their
attack
upon
him
in
chicago
no
human
being
could
get
anything
through
the
chicago
city
council
without
paying
for
it
he
declared
it
simply
a
question
of
who
putting
up
the
money
he
told
how
truman
leslie
macdonald
had
once
tried
to
shake
him
down
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
how
the
newspapers
had
since
found
it
possible
to
make
money
to
increase
their
circulation
by
attacking
him
he
frankly
admitted
the
fact
of
his
social
ostracism
attributing
it
partially
to
aileen
deficiencies
and
partially
to
his
own
attitude
of
promethean
defiance
which
had
never
yet
brooked
defeat
and
i
will
defeat
them
now
he
said
solemnly
to
berenice
one
day
over
a
at
the
plaza
when
the
room
was
nearly
empty
his
gray
eyes
were
a
study
in
colossal
enigmatic
spirit
the
governor
has
signed
my
franchise
bill
this
was
before
the
closing
events
at
springfield
but
he
will
sign
it
then
i
have
one
more
fight
ahead
of
me
i
going
to
combine
all
the
traffic
lines
out
there
under
one
general
system
i
am
the
logical
person
to
provide
it
later
on
if
public
ownership
ever
arrives
the
city
can
buy
it
and
then
asked
berenice
sweetly
flattered
by
his
confidences
oh
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
live
abroad
you
do
seem
to
be
very
much
interested
in
me
i
finish
my
picture
collection
but
supposing
you
should
lose
i
do
contemplate
losing
he
remarked
coolly
whatever
happens
i
have
enough
to
live
on
i
a
little
tired
of
contest
he
smiled
but
berenice
saw
that
the
thought
of
defeat
was
a
gray
one
with
victory
was
his
heart
and
only
there
owing
to
the
national
publicity
being
given
to
cowperwood
affairs
at
this
time
the
effect
upon
berenice
of
these
conversations
with
him
was
considerable
at
the
same
time
another
and
somewhat
sinister
influence
was
working
in
his
favor
by
slow
degrees
she
and
her
mother
were
coming
to
learn
that
the
of
society
were
no
longer
willing
to
accept
them
berenice
had
become
at
last
too
individual
a
figure
to
be
overlooked
at
an
important
luncheon
given
by
the
harris
haggertys
some
five
months
after
the
beales
chadsey
affair
she
had
been
pointed
out
to
haggerty
by
a
visiting
guest
from
cincinnati
as
some
one
with
whom
rumor
was
concerning
itself
haggerty
wrote
to
friends
in
louisville
for
information
and
received
it
shortly
after
at
the
party
of
a
certain
geraldine
borga
berenice
who
had
been
her
sister
schoolmate
was
curiously
omitted
she
took
sharp
note
of
that
subsequently
the
haggertys
failed
to
include
her
as
they
had
always
done
before
in
their
generous
summer
invitations
this
was
true
also
of
the
lanman
zeiglers
and
the
lucas
demmigs
no
direct
affront
was
offered
she
was
simply
no
longer
invited
also
one
morning
she
read
in
the
tribune
that
corscaden
batjer
had
sailed
for
italy
no
word
of
this
had
been
sent
to
berenice
yet
batjer
was
supposedly
one
of
her
best
friends
a
hint
to
some
is
of
more
avail
than
an
open
statement
to
others
berenice
knew
quite
well
in
which
direction
the
tide
was
setting
true
there
were
a
number
the
of
the
smart
world
who
protested
patrick
gilbennin
for
instance
no
you
do
tell
me
what
a
shame
well
i
like
bevy
and
shall
always
like
her
clever
and
she
can
come
here
just
as
long
as
she
chooses
it
her
fault
she
a
lady
at
heart
and
always
will
be
life
is
so
cruel
augustus
tabreez
is
that
really
true
i
ca
believe
it
just
the
same
she
too
charming
to
be
dropped
i
for
one
propose
to
ignore
these
rumors
just
as
long
as
i
dare
she
can
come
here
if
she
ca
go
anywhere
else
pennington
drury
that
of
bevy
fleming
who
says
so
i
do
believe
it
i
like
her
anyhow
the
idea
of
the
haggertys
cutting
her
dull
fools
well
she
can
be
my
guest
the
dear
thing
as
long
as
she
pleases
as
though
her
career
really
affected
her
nevertheless
in
the
world
of
the
dull
rich
those
who
hold
their
own
by
might
of
possession
conformity
sobriety
and
ignorance
bevy
fleming
had
become
persona
non
grata
how
did
she
take
all
this
with
that
air
of
superior
consciousness
which
knows
that
no
shift
of
outer
material
can
detract
one
jot
from
an
inward
mental
superiority
the
truly
individual
know
themselves
from
the
beginning
and
rarely
if
ever
doubt
life
may
play
fast
and
loose
about
them
running
like
a
racing
destructive
tide
in
and
out
but
they
themselves
are
like
a
rock
still
serene
unmoved
bevy
fleming
felt
herself
to
be
so
immensely
superior
to
anything
of
which
she
was
a
part
that
she
could
afford
to
hold
her
head
high
even
now
just
the
same
in
order
to
remedy
the
situation
she
now
looked
about
her
with
an
eye
single
to
a
possible
satisfactory
marriage
braxmar
had
gone
for
good
he
was
somewhere
in
the
east
in
china
she
heard
his
infatuation
for
her
apparently
dead
kilmer
duelma
was
gone
also
snapped
up
an
acquisition
on
the
part
of
one
of
those
families
who
did
not
now
receive
her
however
in
the
where
she
still
appeared
and
what
were
they
but
marriage
markets
one
or
two
affairs
did
spring
up
tentative
approachments
on
the
part
of
scions
of
wealth
they
were
destined
to
prove
abortive
one
of
these
youths
pedro
ricer
marcado
a
brazilian
educated
at
oxford
promised
much
for
sincerity
and
feeling
until
he
learned
that
berenice
was
poor
in
her
own
right
and
what
else
some
one
had
whispered
something
in
his
ear
again
there
was
a
certain
william
drake
bowdoin
the
son
of
a
famous
old
family
who
lived
on
the
north
side
of
washington
square
after
a
ball
a
morning
musicale
and
one
other
affair
at
which
they
met
bowdoin
took
berenice
to
see
his
mother
and
sister
who
were
charmed
oh
you
serene
divinity
he
said
to
her
ecstatically
one
day
wo
you
marry
me
bevy
looked
at
him
and
wondered
let
us
wait
just
a
little
longer
my
dear
she
counseled
i
want
you
to
be
sure
that
you
really
love
me
shortly
thereafter
meeting
an
old
classmate
at
a
club
bowdoin
was
greeted
as
follows
look
here
bowdoin
you
a
friend
of
mine
i
see
you
with
that
miss
fleming
now
i
do
know
how
far
things
have
gone
and
i
want
to
intrude
but
are
you
sure
you
are
aware
of
all
the
aspects
of
the
case
what
do
you
mean
demanded
bowdoin
i
want
you
to
speak
out
oh
pardon
old
man
no
offense
really
you
know
me
i
could
college
and
all
that
just
this
though
before
you
go
any
further
inquire
about
you
may
hear
things
if
they
true
you
ought
to
know
if
not
the
talking
ought
to
stop
if
i
wrong
call
on
me
for
amends
i
hear
talk
i
tell
you
best
intentions
in
the
world
old
man
i
do
assure
you
more
inquiries
the
tongues
of
jealousy
and
envy
bowdoin
was
sure
to
inherit
three
million
dollars
then
a
very
necessary
trip
to
somewhere
and
berenice
stared
at
herself
in
the
glass
what
was
it
what
were
people
saying
if
anything
this
was
strange
well
she
was
young
and
beautiful
there
were
others
still
she
might
have
come
to
love
bowdoin
he
was
so
airy
artistic
in
an
unconscious
way
really
she
had
thought
better
of
him
the
effect
of
all
this
was
not
wholly
depressing
enigmatic
disdainful
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
and
a
world
of
gaiety
and
courage
berenice
heard
at
times
behind
joy
the
hollow
echo
of
unreality
here
was
a
ticklish
business
this
living
for
want
of
light
and
air
the
finest
flowers
might
die
her
mother
error
was
not
so
inexplicable
now
by
it
had
she
not
after
all
preserved
herself
and
her
family
to
a
certain
phase
of
social
superiority
beauty
was
of
such
substance
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
as
fleeting
not
one
self
alone
one
inmost
worth
the
splendor
of
one
dreams
but
other
things
name
wealth
the
presence
or
absence
of
rumor
and
of
accident
were
important
berenice
lip
curled
but
life
could
be
lived
one
could
lie
to
the
world
youth
is
optimistic
and
berenice
in
spite
of
her
splendid
mind
was
so
young
she
saw
life
as
a
game
a
good
chance
that
could
be
played
in
many
ways
cowperwood
theory
of
things
began
to
appeal
to
her
one
must
create
one
own
career
carve
it
out
or
remain
horribly
dull
or
bored
dragged
along
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
others
if
society
was
so
finicky
if
men
were
so
dull
well
there
was
one
thing
she
could
do
she
must
have
life
life
and
money
would
help
some
to
that
end
besides
cowperwood
by
degrees
was
becoming
attractive
to
her
he
really
was
he
was
so
much
better
than
most
of
the
others
so
very
powerful
she
was
preternaturally
gay
as
one
who
says
victory
shall
be
mine
anyhow
chapter
lxi
the
cataclysm
and
now
at
last
chicago
is
really
facing
the
thing
which
it
has
most
feared
a
giant
monopoly
is
really
reaching
out
to
enfold
it
with
an
grip
and
cowperwood
is
its
eyes
its
tentacles
its
force
embedded
in
the
giant
strength
and
good
will
of
haeckelheimer
gotloeb
he
is
like
a
monument
based
on
a
rock
of
great
strength
a
franchise
to
be
delivered
to
him
by
a
majority
of
out
of
a
total
of
aldermen
in
case
the
ordinance
has
to
be
passed
over
the
mayor
veto
is
all
that
now
stands
between
him
and
the
realization
of
his
dreams
what
a
triumph
for
his
iron
policy
of
courage
in
the
face
of
all
obstacles
what
a
tribute
to
his
ability
not
to
flinch
in
the
face
of
storm
and
stress
other
men
might
have
abandoned
the
game
long
before
but
not
he
what
a
splendid
windfall
of
chance
that
the
money
element
should
of
its
own
accord
take
fright
at
the
chicago
idea
of
the
municipalization
of
public
privilege
and
should
hand
him
this
giant
south
side
system
as
a
reward
for
his
stern
opposition
to
theories
through
the
influence
of
these
powerful
advocates
he
was
invited
to
speak
before
various
local
commercial
bodies
the
board
of
real
estate
dealers
the
property
owners
association
the
merchants
league
the
bankers
union
and
so
forth
where
he
had
an
opportunity
to
present
his
case
and
justify
his
cause
but
the
effect
of
his
suave
speechifyings
in
these
quarters
was
largely
neutralized
by
newspaper
denunciation
can
any
good
come
out
of
nazareth
was
the
regular
inquiry
that
section
of
the
press
formerly
beholden
to
hand
and
schryhart
stood
out
as
bitterly
as
ever
and
most
of
the
other
newspapers
being
under
no
obligation
to
eastern
capital
felt
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
support
the
rank
and
file
the
most
searching
and
elaborate
mathematical
examinations
were
conducted
with
a
view
to
showing
the
fabulous
profits
of
the
streetcar
trust
in
future
years
the
fine
hand
of
eastern
was
detected
and
their
sinister
motives
noised
abroad
millions
for
everybody
in
the
trust
but
not
one
cent
for
chicago
was
the
inquirer
way
of
putting
it
certain
altruists
of
the
community
were
by
now
so
aroused
that
in
the
destruction
of
cowperwood
they
saw
their
duty
to
god
to
humanity
and
to
democracy
straight
and
clear
the
heavens
had
once
more
opened
and
they
saw
a
great
light
on
the
other
hand
the
politicians
those
in
office
outside
the
mayor
constituted
a
petty
band
of
guerrillas
or
who
like
hungry
swine
shut
in
a
pen
were
ready
to
fall
upon
any
and
all
propositions
brought
to
their
attention
with
but
one
end
in
view
that
they
might
eat
and
eat
heartily
in
times
of
great
opportunity
and
contest
for
privilege
life
always
sinks
to
its
lowest
depths
of
materialism
and
rises
at
the
same
time
to
its
highest
reaches
of
the
ideal
when
the
waves
of
the
sea
are
most
towering
its
hollows
are
most
awesome
finally
the
summer
passed
the
council
assembled
and
with
the
first
breath
of
autumn
chill
the
very
air
of
the
city
was
touched
by
a
premonition
of
contest
cowperwood
disappointed
by
the
outcome
of
his
various
ingratiatory
efforts
decided
to
fall
back
on
his
old
reliable
method
of
bribery
he
fixed
on
his
price
twenty
thousand
dollars
for
each
favorable
vote
to
begin
with
later
if
necessary
he
would
raise
it
to
thousand
or
even
thirty
thousand
making
the
total
cost
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
million
and
a
half
yet
it
was
a
small
price
indeed
when
the
ultimate
return
was
considered
he
planned
to
have
his
ordinance
introduced
by
an
alderman
named
ballenberg
a
trusted
lieutenant
and
handed
thereafter
to
the
clerk
who
would
read
it
whereupon
another
henchman
would
rise
to
move
that
it
be
referred
to
the
joint
committee
on
streets
and
alleys
consisting
of
members
drawn
from
all
the
standing
committees
by
this
committee
it
would
be
considered
for
one
week
in
the
general
where
public
hearings
would
be
held
by
keeping
up
a
bold
front
cowperwood
thought
the
necessary
iron
could
be
put
into
his
followers
to
enable
them
to
go
through
with
the
scorching
ordeal
which
was
sure
to
follow
already
aldermen
were
being
besieged
at
their
homes
and
in
the
precincts
of
the
ward
clubs
and
their
mail
was
being
packed
with
importuning
or
threatening
letters
their
very
children
were
being
derided
their
neighbors
urged
to
chastise
them
ministers
wrote
them
in
appealing
or
denunciatory
vein
they
were
spied
upon
and
abused
daily
in
the
public
prints
the
mayor
shrewd
son
of
battle
that
he
was
realizing
that
he
had
a
whip
of
terror
in
his
hands
excited
by
the
long
contest
waged
and
by
the
smell
of
battle
was
not
backward
in
urging
the
most
drastic
remedies
wait
till
the
thing
comes
up
he
said
to
his
friends
in
a
great
central
conference
in
which
thousands
participated
and
when
the
matter
of
ways
and
means
to
defeat
the
venal
aldermen
was
being
discussed
we
have
cowperwood
in
a
corner
i
think
he
can
not
do
anything
for
two
weeks
once
his
ordinance
is
in
and
by
that
time
we
shall
be
able
to
organize
a
vigilance
committee
ward
meetings
marching
clubs
and
the
like
we
ought
to
organize
a
great
central
for
the
sunday
night
before
the
monday
when
the
bill
comes
up
for
final
hearing
we
want
overflow
meetings
in
every
ward
at
the
same
time
i
tell
you
gentlemen
that
while
i
believe
there
are
enough
honest
voters
in
the
city
council
to
prevent
the
cowperwood
crowd
from
passing
this
bill
over
my
veto
yet
i
do
think
the
matter
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
that
far
you
never
can
tell
what
these
rascals
will
do
once
they
see
an
actual
cash
bid
of
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
before
them
most
of
them
even
if
they
were
lucky
would
never
make
the
half
of
that
in
a
lifetime
they
do
expect
to
be
returned
to
the
chicago
city
council
once
is
enough
there
are
too
many
others
behind
them
waiting
to
get
their
noses
in
the
trough
go
into
your
respective
wards
and
districts
and
organize
meetings
call
your
particular
alderman
before
you
do
let
him
evade
you
or
quibble
or
stand
on
his
rights
as
a
private
citizen
or
a
public
officer
threaten
do
cajole
soft
or
kind
words
wo
go
with
that
type
of
man
threaten
and
when
you
have
managed
to
extract
a
promise
be
on
hand
with
ropes
to
see
that
he
keeps
his
word
i
like
to
advise
arbitrary
methods
but
what
else
is
to
be
done
the
enemy
is
armed
and
ready
for
action
right
now
they
just
waiting
for
a
peaceful
moment
do
let
them
find
it
be
ready
fight
your
mayor
and
ready
to
do
all
i
can
but
i
stand
alone
with
a
mere
pitiful
veto
right
you
help
me
and
i
help
you
you
fight
for
me
and
i
fight
for
you
witness
hereafter
the
discomfiting
situation
of
simon
pinski
at
on
the
second
evening
following
the
introduction
of
the
ordinance
in
the
ward
house
of
the
fourteenth
ward
democratic
club
rotund
flaccid
his
costume
a
long
black
and
silk
hat
pinski
was
being
heckled
by
his
neighbors
and
business
associates
he
had
been
called
here
by
threats
to
answer
for
his
prospective
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
by
now
it
was
pretty
well
understood
that
nearly
all
the
present
aldermen
were
criminal
and
venal
and
in
consequence
party
enmities
were
practically
wiped
out
there
were
no
longer
for
the
time
being
democrats
and
republicans
but
only
pro
or
anti
cowperwoods
principally
anti
pinski
unfortunately
had
been
singled
out
by
the
transcript
the
inquirer
and
the
chronicle
as
one
of
those
open
to
advance
questioning
by
his
constituents
of
mixed
jewish
and
american
extraction
he
had
been
born
and
raised
in
the
fourteenth
and
spoke
with
a
decidedly
american
accent
he
was
neither
small
nor
large
cunning
and
on
most
occasions
amiable
just
now
he
was
decidedly
nervous
wrathy
and
perplexed
for
he
had
been
brought
here
against
his
will
his
slightly
oleaginous
eye
not
unlike
that
of
a
small
pig
had
been
fixed
definitely
and
finally
on
the
munificent
sum
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
no
less
and
this
local
agitation
threatened
to
deprive
him
of
his
almost
unalienable
right
to
the
same
his
ordeal
took
place
in
a
large
room
illuminated
by
five
very
plain
thin
suspended
from
the
ceiling
and
adorned
by
posters
of
prizefights
raffles
games
and
the
simon
pinski
pleasure
association
plastered
here
and
there
freely
against
dirty
walls
he
stood
on
the
low
raised
platform
at
the
back
of
the
room
surrounded
by
a
score
or
more
of
his
ward
henchmen
all
more
or
less
reliable
all
or
at
least
in
their
sunday
clothes
all
scowling
nervous
defensive
and
fearing
trouble
pinski
has
come
armed
this
talk
of
the
concerning
guns
ropes
drums
marching
clubs
and
the
like
has
been
given
very
wide
publicity
and
the
public
seems
rather
eager
for
a
chicago
holiday
in
which
the
slaughter
of
an
alderman
or
so
might
furnish
the
leading
and
most
acceptable
feature
hey
pinski
yells
some
one
out
of
a
small
sea
of
new
and
decidedly
unfriendly
faces
this
is
no
meeting
of
pinski
followers
but
a
conglomerate
outpouring
of
all
those
elements
of
a
distrait
populace
bent
on
enforcing
for
once
the
principles
of
aldermanic
decency
there
are
even
women
here
local
and
one
or
two
advanced
civic
reformers
and
smashers
pinski
has
been
summoned
to
their
presence
by
the
threat
that
if
he
did
come
the
noble
company
would
seek
him
out
later
at
his
own
house
hey
pinski
you
old
boodler
how
much
do
you
expect
to
get
out
of
this
traction
business
this
from
a
voice
somewhere
in
the
rear
pinski
turning
to
one
side
as
if
pinched
in
the
neck
the
man
that
says
i
am
a
boodler
is
a
liar
i
never
took
a
dishonest
dollar
in
my
life
and
everybody
in
the
fourteenth
ward
knows
it
the
five
hundred
people
assembled
ha
ha
ha
pinski
never
took
a
dollar
ho
ho
ho
pinski
very
rising
it
is
so
why
should
i
talk
to
a
lot
of
loafers
that
come
here
because
the
papers
tell
them
to
call
me
names
i
have
been
an
alderman
for
six
years
now
everybody
knows
me
a
voice
you
call
us
loafers
you
crook
another
voice
referring
to
his
statement
of
being
known
you
bet
they
do
another
voice
this
from
a
small
bony
plumber
in
workclothes
hey
you
old
grafter
which
way
do
you
expect
to
vote
for
or
against
this
franchise
which
way
still
another
voice
an
insurance
clerk
yes
which
way
pinski
rising
once
more
for
in
his
nervousness
he
is
constantly
rising
or
starting
to
rise
and
then
sitting
down
again
i
have
a
right
to
my
own
mind
ai
i
i
got
a
right
to
think
what
for
am
i
an
alderman
then
the
constitution
an
republican
a
young
law
clerk
to
hell
with
the
constitution
no
fine
words
now
pinski
which
way
do
you
expect
to
vote
for
or
against
yes
or
no
a
voice
that
of
a
bricklayer
he
dares
say
got
some
of
that
bastard
money
in
his
jeans
now
i
bet
a
voice
from
behind
one
of
pinski
henchmen
a
heavy
pugilistic
irishman
do
let
them
frighten
you
sim
stand
your
ground
they
ca
hurt
you
we
here
pinski
getting
up
once
more
this
is
an
outrage
i
say
ai
i
gon
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
i
think
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
now
i
think
whatever
the
newspapers
say
that
cowperwood
a
journeyman
carpenter
a
reader
of
the
inquirer
you
bribed
you
thief
you
beating
about
the
bush
you
want
to
sell
out
the
bony
plumber
yes
you
crook
you
want
to
get
away
with
thirty
thousand
dollars
that
what
you
want
you
boodler
pinski
defiantly
egged
on
by
voices
from
behind
i
want
to
be
fair
that
what
i
want
to
keep
my
own
mind
the
constitution
gives
everybody
the
right
of
free
speech
even
me
i
insist
that
the
companies
have
some
rights
at
the
same
time
the
people
have
rights
too
a
voice
what
are
those
rights
another
voice
he
do
know
he
would
know
the
people
rights
from
a
sawmill
another
voice
or
a
load
of
hay
pinski
continuing
very
defiantly
now
since
he
has
not
yet
been
slain
i
say
the
people
have
their
rights
the
companies
ought
to
be
made
to
pay
a
fair
tax
but
this
idea
is
too
little
i
think
the
mears
bill
now
gives
them
fifty
years
and
i
think
all
told
the
five
hundred
in
chorus
ho
you
robber
you
thief
you
boodler
hang
him
ho
ho
ho
get
a
rope
pinski
retreating
within
a
defensive
circle
as
various
citizens
approach
him
their
eyes
blazing
their
teeth
showing
their
fists
clenched
my
friends
wait
ai

goin
to
be

and

of

meeting
becomes
disorderly
pinski
is
escorted
out
by
friends
completely
surrounded
amid
shrieks
and
hisses
cries
of
boodler
thief
robber
there
were
many
such
little
dramatic
incidents
after
the
ordinance
had
been
introduced
henceforth
on
the
streets
in
the
wards
and
outlying
sections
and
even
on
occasion
in
the
business
heart
behold
the
marching
clubs
those
sinister
ephemeral
organizations
which
on
demand
of
the
mayor
had
cropped
out
into
existence
great
companies
of
the
unheralded
the
dull
the
undistinguished
clerks
small
business
men
and
minor
scions
of
religion
or
morality
all
tramping
to
and
fro
of
an
evening
after
assembling
in
cheap
halls
and
party
and
drilling
themselves
to
what
end
that
they
might
march
to
the
city
hall
on
the
fateful
monday
night
when
the
ordinances
should
be
up
for
passage
and
demand
of
unregenerate
lawmakers
that
they
do
their
duty
cowperwood
coming
down
to
his
office
one
morning
on
his
own
elevated
lines
was
the
observer
of
a
button
or
badge
worn
upon
the
coat
lapel
of
stolid
inconsequential
citizens
who
sat
reading
their
papers
unconscious
of
that
presence
which
epitomized
the
terror
and
the
power
they
all
feared
one
of
these
badges
had
for
its
device
a
gallows
with
a
free
noose
suspended
another
was
blazoned
with
the
query
are
we
going
to
be
robbed
on
fences
and
dead
walls
huge
posters
four
by
six
feet
in
dimension
were
displayed
walden
lucas
against
the
boodlers
every
citizen
of
chicago
should
come
down
to
the
city
hall
monday
and
every
monday
night
thereafter
while
the
franchises
are
under
consideration
and
see
that
the
interests
of
the
city
are
protected
against
boodleism
citizens
arouse
and
defeat
the
boodlers
in
the
papers
were
flaring
in
the
clubs
halls
and
churches
fiery
speeches
could
nightly
be
heard
men
were
drunk
now
with
a
kind
of
fury
of
contest
they
would
not
succumb
to
this
titan
who
was
bent
on
undoing
them
they
would
not
be
devoured
by
this
gorgon
of
the
east
he
should
be
made
to
pay
an
honest
return
to
the
city
or
get
out
no
franchise
should
be
granted
him
the
mears
law
must
be
repealed
and
he
must
come
into
the
city
council
humble
and
with
clean
hands
no
alderman
who
received
as
much
as
a
dollar
for
his
vote
should
in
this
instance
be
safe
with
his
life
needless
to
say
that
in
the
face
of
such
a
campaign
of
intimidation
only
great
courage
could
win
the
aldermen
were
only
human
in
the
council
cowperwood
went
freely
among
them
explaining
as
he
best
could
the
justice
of
his
course
and
making
it
plain
that
although
willing
to
buy
his
rights
he
looked
on
them
as
no
more
than
his
due
the
rule
of
the
council
was
barter
and
he
accepted
it
his
unshaken
and
unconquerable
defiance
heartened
his
followers
greatly
and
the
thought
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
was
as
a
buttress
against
many
terrors
at
the
same
time
many
an
alderman
speculated
solemnly
as
to
what
he
would
do
afterward
and
where
he
would
go
once
he
had
sold
out
at
last
the
monday
night
arrived
which
was
to
bring
the
final
test
of
strength
picture
the
large
ponderous
structure
of
black
granite
erected
at
the
expense
of
millions
and
suggesting
somewhat
the
somnolent
architecture
of
ancient
egypt
which
served
as
the
city
hall
and
county
combined
on
this
evening
the
four
streets
surrounding
it
were
packed
with
thousands
of
people
to
this
throng
cowperwood
has
become
an
astounding
figure
his
wealth
fabulous
his
heart
iron
his
intentions
sinister
the
acme
of
cruel
plotting
deviltry
only
this
day
the
chronicle
calculating
well
the
hour
and
the
occasion
has
completely
covered
one
of
its
pages
with
an
intimate
though
exaggerated
description
of
cowperwood
house
in
new
york
his
court
of
orchids
his
sunrise
room
the
baths
of
pink
and
blue
alabaster
the
finishings
of
marble
and
intaglio
here
cowperwood
was
represented
as
seated
in
a
swinging
divan
his
various
books
art
treasures
and
comforts
piled
about
him
the
idea
was
vaguely
suggested
that
in
his
sybaritic
hours
odalesques
danced
before
him
and
unnamable
indulgences
and
excesses
were
perpetrated
at
this
same
hour
in
the
itself
were
assembling
as
hungry
and
bold
a
company
of
gray
wolves
as
was
ever
gathered
under
one
roof
the
room
was
large
ornamented
to
the
south
by
tall
windows
its
ceiling
supporting
a
heavy
intricate
chandelier
its
aldermanic
desks
arranged
in
one
behind
the
other
its
woodwork
of
black
oak
carved
and
highly
polished
its
walls
a
dark
decorated
with
arabesques
in
gold
thus
giving
to
all
proceedings
an
air
of
dignity
and
stateliness
above
the
head
was
an
immense
portrait
in
oil
of
a
former
mayor
poorly
done
dusty
and
yet
impressive
the
size
and
character
of
the
place
gave
on
ordinary
occasions
a
sort
of
resonance
to
the
voices
of
the
speakers
through
the
closed
windows
could
be
heard
the
sound
of
distant
drums
and
marching
feet
in
the
hall
outside
the
council
door
were
packed
at
least
a
thousand
men
with
ropes
sticks
a
corps
which
occasionally
struck
up
hail
columbia
happy
land
my
country
is
of
thee
and
dixie
alderman
schlumbohm
heckled
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
followed
to
the
council
door
by
three
hundred
of
his
was
there
left
with
the
admonition
that
they
would
be
waiting
for
him
when
he
should
make
his
exit
he
was
at
last
seriously
impressed
what
is
this
he
asked
of
his
neighbor
and
nearest
associate
alderman
gavegan
when
he
gained
the
safety
of
his
seat
a
free
country
search
me
replied
his
compatriot
wearily
i
never
seen
such
a
band
as
i
have
to
deal
with
out
in
the
twentieth
why
my
god
a
man
ca
call
his
name
his
own
any
more
out
here
it
got
so
now
the
newspapers
tell
everybody
what
to
do
alderman
pinski
and
alderman
hoherkorn
conferring
together
in
one
corner
were
both
very
dour
i
tell
you
what
joe
said
pinski
to
his
confrere
it
this
fellow
lucas
that
has
got
the
people
so
stirred
up
i
did
go
home
last
night
because
i
did
want
those
fellows
to
follow
me
down
there
me
and
my
wife
stayed
but
one
of
the
boys
was
over
here
at
jake
a
little
while
ago
and
he
says
there
must
been
five
hundred
people
around
my
house
at
six
already
whad
ye
think
o
that
same
here
i
do
take
much
stock
in
this
lynching
idea
still
you
ca
tell
i
do
know
whether
the
police
could
help
us
much
or
not
it
a
damned
outrage
cowperwood
has
a
fair
proposition
what
the
matter
with
them
anyhow
renewed
sounds
of
marching
through
georgia
from
without
enter
at
this
time
aldermen
ziner
knudson
revere
rogers
tiernan
and
kerrigan
of
all
the
aldermen
perhaps
tiernan
and
kerrigan
were
as
cool
as
any
still
the
spectacle
of
streets
blocked
with
people
who
carried
torches
and
wore
badges
showing
attached
to
a
gallows
was
rather
serious
i
tell
you
pat
said
smiling
mike
as
they
eventually
made
the
door
through
throngs
of
jeering
citizens
it
does
look
a
little
rough
whad
ye
think
to
hell
with
them
replied
kerrigan
angry
waspish
determined
they
do
run
me
or
my
ward
i
vote
as
i
damn
please
same
here
replied
tiernan
with
a
great
show
of
courage
that
goes
for
me
but
it
putty
warm
anyhow
eh
yes
it
warm
all
right
replied
kerrigan
suspicious
lest
his
companion
in
arms
might
be
weakening
but
that
never
make
a
quitter
out
of
me
nor
me
either
replied
the
smiling
one
enter
now
the
mayor
accompanied
by
a
corps
rendering
hail
to
the
chief
he
ascends
the
rostrum
outside
in
the
halls
the
huzzas
of
the
populace
in
the
gallery
overhead
a
picked
audience
as
the
various
aldermen
look
up
they
contemplate
a
sea
of
unfriendly
faces
get
on
to
the
mayor
guests
commented
one
alderman
to
another
cynically
a
little
sparring
for
time
while
minor
matters
are
considered
and
the
gallery
is
given
opportunity
for
comment
on
the
various
communal
lights
identifying
for
itself
first
one
local
celebrity
and
then
another

dowling
that
big
blond
fellow
with
the
round
head
there

at
the
little
rat
there

on
to
the
emerald

any
grafting

alderman
winkler
if
the
chair

to
be
done
to
restore
order
in
the
gallery
and
keep
these
proceedings
from
being
disturbed
it
seems
to
me
an
outrage
that
on
an
occasion
of
this
kind
when
the
interests
of
the
people
require
the
most
careful
attention
a
voice
the
interests
of
the
people
another
voice
sit
down
you
bought
alderman
winkler
if
the
chair
pleases
the
mayor
i
shall
have
to
ask
the
audience
in
the
gallery
to
keep
quiet
in
order
that
the
business
in
hand
may
be
considered
applause
and
the
gallery
lapses
into
silence
alderman
guigler
to
alderman
sumulsky
well
trained
eh
alderman
ballenberg
getting
up
large
brown
florid
before
calling
up
an
ordinance

bears
my
name

should
like
to
ask
permission
of
the
council
to
make
a
statement
when
i
introduced
this
ordinance
last
week

said
a
voice
we
know
what
you
said
alderman
ballenberg
i
said
that
i
did
so
by
request
i
want
to
explain
that
it
was
at
the
request
of
a
number
of
gentlemen
who
have
since
appeared
before
the
committee
of
this
council
that
now
has
this
ordinance
a
voice

all
right

whose
request

his
feet

is
an
outrage

gallery

packed
with
people
come
here
to
intimidate
us
here
is
a
great
public
corporation
that
has
served
this
city
for
years
and
served
it
well
and
when
it
comes
to
this
body
with
a
sensible
proposition
we
ai
even
allowed
to
consider
it
the
mayor
packs
the
gallery
with
his
friends
and
the
papers
stir
up
people
to
come
down
here
by
thousands
and
try
to
frighten
us
i
for
one
a
voice
what
the
matter
billy
have
you
got
your
money
yet
alderman
hvranek
intelligent
even
artistic
looking
shaking
his
fist
at
the
gallery

down
here
and
say
that
you
coward
a
chorus
of
fifty
voices
rats
also
billy
you
ought
to
have
wings
alderman
tiernan
rising
i
say

had
enough
of
this
a
voice
well
look
who

voice
how
much
do
you
expect

get
mike
alderman
tiernan
turning
to
gallery
i
want
to
say
i
can
lick
any
man
that
wants
to
come
down
here
and
talk
to
me
to
my
face
i
not
afraid
of
no
ropes
and
no
guns
these
corporations
have
done
everything
for
the
city
a
voice
aw
alderman
tiernan
if
it
was
for
the
companies
we
would
have
any
city
ten
voices
aw
alderman
tiernan
bravely
my
mind
ai
the
mind
of
some
people
a
voice
i
should
say
not
alderman
tiernan
i
talking
for
compensation
for
the
privileges
we
expect
to
give
a
voice
you
talking
for
your
alderman
tiernan
i
do
give
a
damn
for
these
cheap
skates
and
cowards
in
the
gallery
i
say
treat
these
corporations
right
they
have
helped
make
the
city
a
chorus
of
fifty
voices
aw
you
want
to
treat
yourself
right
that
what
you
want
you
vote
right
or
you
be
sorry
by
now
the
various
aldermen
outside
of
the
most
hardened
characters
were
more
or
less
terrified
by
the
grilling
contest
it
could
do
no
good
to
battle
with
this
gallery
or
the
crowd
outside
above
them
sat
the
mayor
before
them
reporters
ticking
in
shorthand
every
phrase
and
word
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
said
alderman
pinski
to
alderman
hvranek
his
neighbor
it
looks
to
me
as
if
we
might
just
as
well
not
try
at
this
point
arose
alderman
gilleran
small
pale
intelligent
by
prearrangement
he
had
been
scheduled
to
bring
the
second
and
as
it
proved
the
final
test
of
strength
to
the
issue
if
the
chair
pleases
he
said
i
move
that
the
vote
by
which
the
ballenberg
ordinance
was
referred
to
the
joint
committee
of
streets
and
alleys
be
reconsidered
and
that
instead
it
be
referred
to
the
committee
on
city
hall
this
was
a
committee
that
hitherto
had
always
been
considered
by
members
of
council
as
of
the
least
importance
its
principal
duties
consisted
in
devising
new
names
for
streets
and
regulating
the
hours
of
servants
there
were
no
perquisites
no
graft
in
a
spirit
of
ribald
defiance
at
the
organization
of
the
present
session
all
the
mayor
friends
the
reformers
those
who
could
not
be
trusted
had
been
relegated
to
this
committee
now
it
was
proposed
to
take
this
ordinance
out
of
the
hands
of
friends
and
send
it
here
from
whence
unquestionably
it
would
never
reappear
the
great
test
had
come
alderman
hoberkorn
mouthpiece
for
his
gang
because
the
most
skilful
in
a
parliamentary
sense
the
vote
can
not
be
reconsidered
he
begins
a
long
explanation
amid
hisses
a
voice
how
much
have
you
got
a
second
voice
you
been
a
boodler
all
your
life
alderman
hoberkorn
turning
to
the
gallery
a
light
of
defiance
in
his
eye
you
come
here
to
intimidate
us
but
you
ca
do
it
too
contemptible
to
notice
a
voice
you
hear
the
drums
do
you
a
second
voice
vote
wrong
hoberkorn
and
see
we
know
you
alderman
tiernan
to
himself
say
that
pretty
rough
ai
it
the
mayor
motion
overruled
the
point
is
not
well
taken
alderman
guigler
rising
a
little
puzzled
do
we
vote
now
on
the
gilleran
resolution
a
voice
you
bet
you
do
and
you
vote
right
the
mayor
yes
the
clerk
will
call
the
roll
the
clerk
reading
the
names
beginning
with
the
a

the
man
who
had
introduced

referring
to
the
courage
of
his
colleagues
coming
out
of
their
hair
in
exactly
eighty
seconds
the
was
in
and
cowperwood
had
lost
to
it
was
plain
that
the
ordinance
could
never
be
revived
chapter
lxii
the
recompense
you
have
seen
perhaps
a
man
whose
heart
was
weighted
by
a
great
woe
you
have
seen
the
eye
darken
the
soul
fag
and
the
spirit
congeal
under
the
breath
of
an
icy
disaster
at
of
this
particular
evening
cowperwood
sitting
alone
in
the
library
of
his
michigan
avenue
house
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
he
had
built
so
much
on
the
cast
of
this
single
die
it
was
useless
to
say
to
himself
that
he
could
go
into
the
council
a
week
later
with
a
modified
ordinance
or
could
wait
until
the
storm
had
died
out
he
refused
himself
these
consolations
already
he
had
battled
so
long
and
so
vigorously
by
every
resource
and
subtlety
which
his
mind
had
been
able
to
devise
all
week
long
on
divers
occasions
he
had
stood
in
the
where
the
committee
had
been
conducting
its
hearings
small
comfort
to
know
that
by
suits
injunctions
appeals
and
writs
to
intervene
he
could
tie
up
this
transit
situation
and
leave
it
for
years
and
years
the
prey
of
lawyers
the
despair
of
the
city
a
hopeless
muddle
which
would
not
be
unraveled
until
he
and
his
enemies
should
long
be
dead
this
contest
had
been
so
long
in
the
brewing
he
had
gone
about
it
with
such
care
years
before
and
now
the
enemy
had
been
heartened
by
a
great
victory
his
aldermen
powerful
hungry
fighting
men
all
like
those
picked
soldiers
of
the
ancient
roman
emperors
ruthless
conscienceless
as
desperate
as
himself
had
in
their
last
redoubt
of
personal
privilege
fallen
weakened
yielded
how
could
he
hearten
them
to
another
struggle
how
face
the
blazing
wrath
of
a
mighty
populace
that
had
once
learned
how
to
win
others
might
enter
here
haeckelheimer
fishel
any
one
of
a
eastern
giants
and
smooth
out
the
ruffled
surface
of
the
angry
sea
that
he
had
blown
to
fury
but
as
for
him
he
was
tired
sick
of
chicago
sick
of
this
interminable
contest
only
recently
he
had
promised
himself
that
if
he
were
to
turn
this
great
trick
he
would
never
again
attempt
anything
so
desperate
or
requiring
so
much
effort
he
would
not
need
to
the
size
of
his
fortune
made
it
of
little
worth
besides
in
spite
of
his
tremendous
vigor
he
was
getting
on
since
he
had
alienated
aileen
he
was
quite
alone
out
of
touch
with
any
one
identified
with
the
earlier
years
of
his
life
his
berenice
still
evaded
him
true
she
had
shown
lately
a
kind
of
warming
sympathy
but
what
was
it
gracious
tolerance
perhaps
a
sense
of
obligation
certainly
little
more
he
felt
he
looked
into
the
future
deciding
heavily
that
he
must
fight
on
whatever
happened
and
then
while
he
sat
thus
drearily
pondering
answering
a
telephone
call
now
and
then
the
rang
and
the
servant
brought
a
card
which
he
said
had
been
presented
by
a
young
woman
who
declared
that
it
would
bring
immediate
recognition
glancing
at
it
cowperwood
jumped
to
his
feet
and
hurried
into
the
one
presence
he
most
craved
there
are
compromises
of
the
spirit
too
elusive
and
subtle
to
be
traced
in
all
their
involute
windings
from
that
earliest
day
when
berenice
fleming
had
first
set
eyes
on
cowperwood
she
had
been
moved
by
a
sense
of
power
an
amazing
and
fascinating
individuality
since
then
by
degrees
he
had
familiarized
her
with
a
thought
of
individual
freedom
of
action
and
a
disregard
of
current
social
standards
which
were
destructive
to
an
earlier
conventional
view
of
things
following
him
through
this
chicago
fight
she
had
been
caught
by
the
wonder
of
his
dreams
he
was
on
the
way
toward
being
one
of
the
world
greatest
money
giants
during
his
recent
trips
east
she
had
sometimes
felt
that
she
was
able
to
read
in
the
cast
of
his
face
the
intensity
of
this
great
ambition
which
had
for
its
ultimate
aim
herself
so
he
had
once
assured
her
always
with
her
he
had
been
so
handsome
so
pleading
so
patient
so
here
she
was
in
chicago
the
guest
of
friends
at
the
richelieu
and
standing
in
cowperwood
presence
why
berenice
he
said
extending
a
cordial
hand
when
did
you
arrive
in
town
whatever
brings
you
here
he
had
once
tried
to
make
her
promise
that
if
ever
her
feeling
toward
him
changed
she
would
let
him
know
of
it
in
some
way
and
here
she
was
on
what
errand
he
noted
her
costume
of
brown
silk
and
velvet
how
well
it
seemed
to
suggest
her
grace
you
bring
me
here
she
replied
with
an
indefinable
something
in
her
voice
which
was
at
once
a
challenge
and
a
confession
i
thought
from
what
i
had
just
been
reading
that
you
might
really
need
me
now
you
mean
he
inquired
looking
at
her
with
vivid
eyes
there
he
paused
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
besides
i
ought
to
pay
some
time
berenice
he
exclaimed
reproachfully
no
i
do
mean
that
either
she
replied
i
am
sorry
now
i
think
i
understand
you
better
besides
she
added
with
a
sudden
gaiety
that
had
a
touch
of
in
it
i
want
to
berenice
truly
ca
you
tell
she
queried
well
then
he
smiled
holding
out
his
hands
and
to
his
amazement
she
came
forward
i
ca
explain
myself
to
myself
quite
she
added
in
a
hurried
low
eager
tone
but
i
could
stay
away
any
longer
i
had
the
feeling
that
you
might
be
going
to
lose
here
for
the
present
but
i
want
you
to
go
somewhere
else
if
you
have
to
london
or
paris
the
world
understand
us
quite
but
i
do
berenice
he
smothered
her
cheek
and
hair
not
so
close
please
and
there
are
to
be
any
other
ladies
unless
you
want
me
to
change
my
mind
not
another
one
as
i
hope
to
keep
you
you
will
share
everything
i
have
for
answer
how
strange
are
realities
as
opposed
to
illusion
in
retrospect
the
world
is
dosed
with
too
much
religion
life
is
to
be
learned
from
life
and
the
professional
moralist
is
at
best
but
a
manufacturer
of
shoddy
wares
at
the
ultimate
remove
god
or
the
life
force
if
anything
is
an
equation
and
at
its
nearest
expression
for
man
the
contract
social
it
is
that
also
its
method
of
expression
appears
to
be
that
of
generating
the
individual
in
all
his
glittering
variety
and
scope
and
through
him
progressing
to
the
mass
with
its
problems
in
the
end
a
balance
is
invariably
struck
wherein
the
mass
subdues
the
individual
or
the
individual
the
mass
for
the
time
being
for
behold
the
sea
is
ever
dancing
or
raging
in
the
mean
time
there
have
sprung
up
social
words
and
phrases
expressing
a
need
of
balance
of
equation
these
are
right
justice
truth
morality
an
honest
mind
a
pure
heart
all
words
meaning
a
balance
must
be
struck
the
strong
must
not
be
too
strong
the
weak
not
too
weak
but
without
variation
how
could
the
balance
be
maintained
nirvana
nirvana
the
ultimate
still
equation
rushing
like
a
great
comet
to
the
zenith
his
path
a
blazing
trail
cowperwood
did
for
the
hour
illuminate
the
terrors
and
wonders
of
individuality
but
for
him
also
the
eternal
equation
the
pathos
of
the
discovery
that
even
giants
are
but
pygmies
and
that
an
ultimate
balance
must
be
struck
of
the
strange
tortured
terrified
reflection
of
those
who
caught
in
his
wake
were
swept
from
the
normal
and
the
commonplace
what
shall
we
say
legislators
by
the
hundred
who
were
hounded
from
politics
into
their
graves
a
aldermen
of
various
councils
who
were
driven
grumbling
or
whining
into
the
limbo
of
the
dull
the
useless
the
commonplace
a
splendid
governor
dreaming
of
an
ideal
on
the
one
hand
succumbing
to
material
necessity
on
the
other
traducing
the
spirit
that
aided
him
the
while
he
tortured
himself
with
his
own
doubts
a
second
governor
more
amenable
was
to
be
greeted
by
the
hisses
of
the
populace
to
retire
brooding
and
discomfited
and
finally
to
take
his
own
life
schryhart
and
hand
venomous
men
both
unable
to
discover
whether
they
had
really
triumphed
were
to
die
eventually
puzzled
a
mayor
whose
greatest
hour
was
in
thwarting
one
who
contemned
him
lived
to
say
it
is
a
great
mystery
he
was
a
strange
man
a
great
city
struggled
for
a
score
of
years
to
untangle
that
which
was
all
but
beyond
the
power
of
solution
a
true
gordian
knot
and
this
giant
himself
rushing
on
to
new
struggles
and
new
difficulties
in
an
older
land
forever
suffering
the
goad
of
a
restless
heart
for
him
was
no
ultimate
peace
no
real
understanding
but
only
hunger
and
thirst
and
wonder
wealth
wealth
wealth
a
new
grasp
of
a
new
great
problem
and
its
eventual
solution
anew
the
old
urgent
thirst
for
life
and
only
its
partial
quenchment
in
dresden
a
palace
for
one
woman
in
rome
a
second
for
another
in
london
a
third
for
his
beloved
berenice
the
lure

in

eye
the
lives
of

wrecked
a
score
of
victims
despoiled
berenice
herself
weary
yet
brilliant
turning
to
others
for
recompense
for
her
lost
youth
and
he
resigned
and
yet
not
loving
understanding
doubting
caught
at
last
by
the
drug
of
a
personality
which
he
could
not
gainsay
what
shall
we
say
of
life
in
the
last
analysis
peace
be
still
or
shall
we
battle
sternly
for
that
equation
which
we
know
will
be
maintained
whether
we
battle
or
no
in
order
that
the
strong
become
not
too
strong
or
the
weak
not
too
weak
or
perchance
shall
we
say
sick
of
dullness
enough
of
this
i
will
have
strong
meat
or
die
and
die
or
live
each
according
to
his
temperament
