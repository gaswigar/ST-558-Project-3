the
whole

i
the
father
by

howells
as
soon
as
we
heard
the
pleasant
news
i
suppose
the
news
of
an
engagement
ought
always
to
be
called
pleasant
it
was
decided
that
i
ought
to
speak
first
about
it
and
speak
to
the
father
we
had
not
been
a
great
while
in
the
neighborhood
and
it
would
look
less
like
a
bid
for
the
familiar
acquaintance
of
people
living
on
a
larger
scale
than
ourselves
and
less
of
an
opening
for
our
own
intimacy
if
they
turned
out
to
be
not
quite
so
desirable
in
other
ways
as
they
were
in
the
worldly
way
for
the
ladies
of
the
respective
families
first
to
offer
and
receive
congratulations
would
be
very
much
more
committing
on
both
sides
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
stiffness
some
one
ought
to
speak
and
speak
promptly
the
news
had
not
come
to
us
directly
from
our
neighbors
but
authoritatively
from
a
friend
of
theirs
who
was
also
a
friend
of
ours
and
we
could
not
very
well
hold
back
so
in
the
cool
of
the
early
evening
when
i
had
quite
finished
rasping
my
lawn
with
the
new
mower
i
left
it
at
the
end
of
the
swath
which
had
brought
me
near
the
fence
and
said
across
it
my
neighbor
turned
from
making
his
man
pour
a
pail
of
water
on
the
earth
round
a
freshly
planted
tree
and
said
oh
how
d
do
glad
to
see
you
and
offered
his
hand
over
the
low
coping
so
cordially
that
i
felt
warranted
in
holding
it
a
moment
i
hope
it
in
order
for
me
to
say
how
very
much
my
wife
and
i
are
interested
in
the
news
we
heard
about
one
of
your
daughters
may
i
offer
our
best
wishes
for
her
happiness
oh
thank
you
my
neighbor
said
you
very
good
indeed
yes
rather
exciting
for
us
i
guess
that
all
for
al
he
said
in
dismissal
of
his
man
before
turning
to
lay
his
arms
comfortably
on
the
fence
top
then
he
laughed
before
he
added
to
me
and
rather
surprising
those
things
are
always
rather
surprising
are
they
i
suggested
well
yes
i
suppose
they
are
it
ought
be
so
in
our
case
though
as
we
been
through
it
twice
before
once
with
my
son
he
to
have
counted
but
he
did
and
once
with
my
eldest
daughter
yes
you
might
say
you
never
do
quite
expect
it
though
everybody
else
does
then
in
this
case
she
was
the
baby
so
long
that
we
always
thought
of
her
as
a
little
girl
yes
she
kept
on
being
the
pet
i
guess
and
we
could
realize
what
was
in
the
i
had
thought
from
the
first
sight
of
him
that
there
was
something
very
charming
in
my
neighbor
looks
he
had
a
large
round
head
which
had
once
been
red
but
was
now
a
russet
silvered
and
was
not
too
large
for
his
manly
frame
swaying
amply
outward
but
not
too
amply
at
the
girth
he
had
blue
kind
eyes
and
a
face
fully
freckled
and
the
girl
he
was
speaking
of
with
a
tenderness
in
his
tones
rather
than
his
words
was
a
young
feminine
copy
of
him
only
her
head
was
little
under
its
load
of
red
hair
and
her
figure
which
we
had
lately
noticed
flitting
in
and
out
as
with
a
shy
consciousness
of
being
stared
at
on
account
of
her
engagement
was
as
light
as
his
was
heavy
on
its
feet
i
said
naturally
and
he
seemed
glad
of
the
chance
to
laugh
again
well
of
course
and
her
being
away
at
school
made
it
all
the
more
so
if
we
had
her
under
our
eye
here
well
we
should
have
had
her
under
our
eye
if
she
had
been
here
or
if
we
had
we
should
have
seen
what
was
going
on
at
least
should
maybe
her
mother
would
so
it
just
as
well
it
happened
as
it
did
happen
i
guess
we
have
been
any
the
wiser
if
we
known
all
about
i
joined
him
in
his
laugh
at
his
paradox
and
he
began
again
what
that
about
being
the
unexpected
that
happens
i
guess
what
happens
is
what
ought
to
have
been
expected
we
might
have
known
when
we
let
her
go
to
a
coeducational
college
that
we
were
taking
a
risk
of
losing
her
but
we
lost
our
other
daughter
that
way
and
she
never
went
to
any
kind
of
college
i
guess
we
counted
the
chances
before
we
let
her
go
what
the
use
of
course
we
did
and
i
remember
saying
to
my
wife
who
more
anxious
than
i
am
about
most
things
women
are
i
guess
that
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
it
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
i
always
thought
it
such
an
objectionable
feature
in
the
coeducational
system
if
the
young
people
did
get
acquainted
under
it
and
maybe
so
well
acquainted
that
they
did
want
to
part
enemies
in
the
end
i
said
to
my
wife
that
i
did
see
how
if
a
girl
was
going
to
get
married
she
could
have
a
better
basis
than
knowing
the
fellow
through
three
or
four
years
hard
work
together
when
you
think
of
the
sort
of
affairs
most
marriages
are
that
young
people
make
after
a
few
parties
and
picnics
coeducation
as
a
preliminary
to
domestic
happiness
does
seem
a
bad
there
something
in
what
you
say
i
assented
of
course
there
is
my
neighbor
insisted
i
could
help
laughing
though
and
he
laughed
as
if
to
show
how
helpless
he
had
been
at
what
my
wife
said
she
said
she
guessed
if
it
came
to
that
they
would
get
to
know
more
of
each
other
looks
than
they
did
of
their
minds
she
had
me
there
but
i
do
think
my
girl
has
made
out
so
very
poorly
even
as
far
as
books
are
upon
this
invitation
to
praise
her
i
ventured
to
say
a
young
lady
of
miss
talbert
looks
does
need
much
help
from
i
could
see
that
what
i
had
said
pleased
him
to
the
core
though
he
put
on
a
frown
of
disclaimer
in
replying
i
do
know
about
her
looks
she
a
good
girl
though
and
that
the
main
thing
i
for
her
father
yes
but
other
people
do
mind
her
being
pretty
i
persisted
my
wife
says
when
miss
talbert
comes
out
into
the
garden
the
other
flowers
have
no
good
for
temple
my
neighbor
shouted
joyously
giving
himself
away
i
have
always
noticed
that
when
you
praise
a
girl
beauty
to
her
father
though
he
makes
a
point
of
turning
it
off
in
the
direction
of
her
goodness
he
likes
so
well
to
believe
she
is
pretty
that
he
can
not
hold
out
against
any
persistence
in
the
admirer
of
her
beauty
my
neighbor
now
said
with
the
effect
of
tasting
a
peculiar
sweetness
in
my
words
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
wife
then
he
added
with
a
rush
of
hospitality
wo
you
come
in
and
tell
her
yourself
not
now
thank
you
it
about
our
glad
it
is
your
he
said
heartily
well
yes
we
do
see
the
sense
of
dining
late
in
a
place
like
this
the
fact
is
we
both
and
we
like
the
dinner
we
make
rather
a
high
tea
so
do
we
i
always
want
a
dish
of
something
hot
my
wife
thinks
cake
is
light
but
i
think
meat
well
cake
is
the
new
england
superstition
i
observed
and
i
suppose
york
state
yes
more
than
pie
is
he
agreed
for
supper
anyway
you
may
have
pie
at
any
or
all
of
the
three
meals
but
you
have
got
to
have
cake
at
tea
if
you
are
anybody
at
all
in
the
place
where
my
wife
lived
a
woman
social
standing
was
measured
by
the
number
of
kinds
of
cake
she
we
laughed
at
that
too
and
then
there
came
a
little
interval
and
i
said
your
place
is
looking
he
turned
his
head
and
gave
it
a
comprehensive
stare
yes
it
is
he
admitted
they
tell
me
it
an
ugly
old
house
and
i
guess
if
my
girls
counting
my
had
their
way
they
would
have
that
french
roof
off
and
something
georgian
that
what
they
call
it
on
about
as
quick
as
the
carpenter
could
do
it
they
want
a
kind
of
classic
front
with
pillars
and
a
pediment
or
more
the
mount
vernon
style
body
yellow
with
white
trim
they
call
it
georgian
after
washington
this
was
obviously
a
joke
no
i
believe
it
was
another
george
or
four
others
but
i
wonder
you
want
to
keep
your
house
as
it
is
it
expresses
something
i
saved
myself
by
forbearing
to
say
it
was
handsome
it
was
in
fact
a
vast
wooden
edifice
with
a
cut
up
into
many
angles
tipped
at
the
gables
with
rockets
and
finials
and
with
a
square
tower
in
front
ending
in
a
sort
of
lookout
at
the
top
with
a
fence
of
iron
filigree
round
it
the
taste
of
could
not
go
further
it
must
have
cost
a
heap
of
money
in
the
depreciated
paper
of
the
day
i
suggested
something
of
the
kind
to
my
neighbor
and
he
laughed
i
guess
it
cost
all
we
had
at
the
time
we
had
been
saving
along
up
and
in
those
days
it
used
to
be
thought
that
the
best
investment
you
could
make
was
to
put
your
money
in
a
house
of
your
own
that
what
we
did
anyway
i
had
just
got
to
be
superintendent
of
the
works
and
i
say
but
what
we
felt
my
position
a
little
well
we
felt
it
more
than
we
did
when
i
got
to
be
he
laughed
in
my
wife
used
to
say
we
wanted
a
large
house
so
as
to
have
it
big
enough
to
hold
me
when
i
was
feeling
my
best
and
we
built
the
largest
we
could
for
all
the
money
we
had
she
had
a
plan
of
her
own
which
she
took
partly
from
the
house
of
a
girl
friend
of
hers
where
she
had
been
visiting
and
we
got
a
builder
to
carry
out
her
idea
we
did
have
some
talk
about
an
architect
but
the
builder
said
he
did
want
any
architect
bothering
around
him
and
i
do
know
as
she
did
either
her
idea
was
plenty
of
chambers
and
plenty
of
room
in
them
and
two
big
parlors
one
side
of
the
front
door
and
a
library
and
on
the
other
kitchen
in
the
l
part
and
girl
room
over
that
wide
front
hall
and
finish
all
through
the
first
floor
it
was
considered
the
best
house
at
the
time
in
eastridge
and
i
guess
it
was
but
now
i
do
say
but
what
it
i
have
to
own
up
to
that
with
the
girls
but
i
tell
them
so
are
we
and
that
seems
to
make
it
all
right
for
a
while
i
guess
we
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
edifice
so
in
its
pretentiousness
and
then
he
turned
and
leaned
over
the
top
of
the
fence
where
he
had
left
his
arms
lying
while
contemplating
the
early
monument
of
his
success
in
making
my
journalistic
study
more
or
less
involuntary
of
eastridge
i
had
put
him
down
as
materially
the
first
man
of
the
place
i
might
have
gone
farther
and
put
him
down
as
the
first
man
intellectually
we
folk
who
have
to
do
more
constantly
with
reading
and
writing
are
apt
to
think
that
the
other
folk
who
have
more
to
do
with
making
and
marketing
have
not
so
much
mind
but
i
fancy
we
make
a
mistake
in
that
now
and
then
it
is
only
another
kind
of
mind
which
they
have
quite
as
much
of
as
we
have
of
ours
it
was
intellectual
force
that
built
up
the
works
of
eastridge
where
there
was
no
other
reason
for
their
being
and
it
was
mental
grip
that
held
constantly
to
the
management
and
finally
grasped
the
ownership
nobody
ever
said
that
talbert
had
come
unfairly
into
that
or
that
he
had
misused
his
money
in
buying
men
after
he
began
to
come
into
it
in
quantity
he
was
felt
in
a
great
many
ways
though
he
made
something
of
a
point
of
not
being
prominent
in
politics
after
being
president
of
the
village
two
terms
the
minister
of
his
church
was
certainly
such
a
preacher
as
he
liked
and
nothing
was
done
in
the
church
society
without
him
he
gave
the
town
a
library
building
and
a
soldier
monument
he
was
foremost
in
getting
the
water
brought
in
which
was
natural
enough
since
he
needed
it
the
most
he
took
a
great
interest
in
school
matters
and
had
a
fight
to
keep
himself
off
the
board
of
education
he
went
into
his
pocket
for
village
improvements
whenever
he
was
asked
and
he
was
the
chief
contributor
to
the
public
fountain
under
the
big
elm
if
he
carefully
or
even
jealously
guarded
his
own
interests
and
held
the
leading
law
firm
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
he
was
not
oppressive
to
the
general
knowledge
he
was
a
despot
perhaps
but
he
was
ideal
of
the
head
of
a
state
a
good
despot
in
all
his
family
relations
he
was
of
the
exemplary
perfection
which
most
other
men
attain
only
on
their
tombstones
and
i
had
found
him
the
best
of
neighbors
there
were
some
shadows
of
diffidence
between
the
ladies
of
our
families
mainly
on
the
part
of
my
wife
but
none
between
talbert
and
me
he
showed
me
as
a
newspaper
man
with
ideals
if
not
abilities
rather
above
the
average
a
deference
which
pleased
my
wife
even
more
than
me
it
was
the
married
daughter
whom
she
most
feared
might
if
occasion
offered
give
herself
more
consequence
than
her
due
she
had
tried
to
rule
her
own
family
while
in
her
father
house
and
now
though
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
my
wife
believed
that
she
had
not
wholly
relinquished
her
dominion
there
her
husband
was
the
junior
member
of
the
law
firm
which
talbert
kept
in
his
pay
to
the
exclusion
of
most
other
clients
and
he
was
a
very
good
fellow
so
far
as
i
knew
with
the
modern
conception
of
his
profession
which
in
our
smaller
towns
and
cities
has
resulted
in
corporation
lawyers
and
criminal
lawyers
and
has
left
to
a
few
aging
attorneys
the
faded
traditions
and
the
scanty
affairs
of
the
profession
my
wife
does
not
mind
his
standing
somewhat
in
awe
of
his
but
she
thinks
poorly
of
his
spirit
in
relation
to
that
managing
girl
he
has
married
talbert
son
is
in
the
business
with
him
and
will
probably
succeed
him
in
it
but
it
is
well
known
in
the
place
that
he
will
never
be
the
man
his
father
is
not
merely
on
account
of
his
college
education
but
also
on
account
of
the
easy
temperament
which
if
he
had
indulged
it
to
the
full
would
have
left
him
no
better
than
some
kind
of
artist
as
it
is
he
seems
to
leave
all
the
push
to
his
father
he
still
does
some
sketching
outside
and
putters
over
the
aesthetic
details
in
the
business
the
new
designs
for
the
plated
ware
and
the
illustrated
catalogues
which
the
house
publishes
every
year
i
am
in
hopes
that
we
shall
get
the
printing
after
we
have
got
the
facilities
it
would
be
all
right
with
the
young
man
in
the
opinion
of
his
censors
if
he
had
married
a
different
kind
of
woman
but
young
talbert
is
popularly
held
just
such
another
as
her
husband
and
to
the
last
degree
she
was
two
or
three
years
at
the
art
students
league
and
it
was
there
that
her
husband
met
her
before
they
both
decided
to
give
up
painting
and
get
married
the
two
youngest
children
or
the
fall
chickens
as
they
are
called
in
recognition
of
the
wide
interval
between
their
ages
and
those
of
the
other
children
are
probably
of
the
indeterminate
character
proper
to
their
years
we
think
the
girl
rather
inclines
to
a
hauteur
based
upon
the
general
neglect
of
that
quality
in
the
family
where
even
the
eldest
sister
is
too
much
engaged
in
ruling
to
have
much
force
left
for
snubbing
the
child
carries
herself
with
a
vague
loftiness
which
has
apparently
not
awaited
the
moment
of
long
skirts
for
keeping
pretenders
to
her
favor
at
a
distance
in
the
default
of
other
impertinents
to
keep
in
abeyance
we
fancy
that
she
exercises
her
gift
upon
her
younger
brother
who
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
note
is
of
a
disposition
which
would
be
entirely
sweet
if
it
were
not
for
the
exasperations
he
suffers
from
her
i
like
to
put
myself
in
his
place
and
to
hold
that
he
believes
himself
a
better
judge
than
she
of
the
sort
of
companions
he
chooses
she
being
disabled
by
the
mental
constitution
of
her
sex
and
the
defects
of
a
girl
training
from
knowing
the
rare
quality
of
boys
who
present
themselves
even
to
my
friendly
eyes
as
dirty
and
when
not
patched
ragged
i
please
myself
in
my
guesses
at
her
character
with
the
conjecture
that
she
is
not
satisfied
with
her
sister
engagement
to
a
in
a
college
who
is
looking
forward
to
a
professorship
in
spite
of
her
injustice
in
regard
to
his
own
companions
this
imaginable
attitude
of
hers
impresses
the
boy
if
i
understand
boys
i
have
no
doubt
he
reasons
that
she
must
be
right
about
something
and
as
she
is
never
right
about
boys
she
must
be
right
about
potential
if
not
actual
this
one
may
be
for
all
the
boy
knows
a
sissy
he
inclines
to
believe
from
what
he
understands
of
the
matter
that
he
is
indeed
a
sissy
or
he
would
never
have
gone
to
a
college
where
half
the
students
are
girls
he
himself
as
i
have
heard
intends
to
go
to
a
college
but
whether
harvard
or
bryant
business
college
he
has
not
yet
decided
one
thing
he
does
know
though
and
that
is
there
are
not
going
to
be
any
girls
in
it
we
have
not
allowed
our
invention
so
great
play
in
regard
to
the
elder
members
of
our
family
perhaps
because
we
really
know
something
more
about
them
talbert
duly
called
after
we
came
to
eastridge
and
when
my
wife
had
waited
a
proper
time
which
she
made
a
little
more
than
a
week
lest
she
should
feel
that
she
had
been
too
eager
for
the
acquaintance
she
returned
the
call
then
she
met
not
only
talbert
but
talbert
mother
who
lives
with
them
in
an
anxiety
for
their
health
which
would
impair
her
own
if
she
were
not
of
a
constitution
such
as
you
do
not
find
in
these
days
of
unladylike
athletics
she
was
inclined
to
be
rather
strict
with
my
wife
about
her
own
health
and
mine
too
and
told
her
she
must
be
careful
not
to
let
me
work
too
hard
or
overeat
or
leave
off
my
flannels
before
the
weather
was
settled
in
the
spring
she
said
she
had
heard
that
i
had
left
a
very
good
position
on
a
buffalo
paper
when
i
bought
the
eastridge
banner
and
that
the
town
ought
to
feel
very
much
honored
my
wife
suppressed
her
conviction
that
this
was
the
correct
view
of
the
case
in
a
deprecatory
expression
of
our
happiness
in
finding
ourselves
in
eastridge
and
our
entire
satisfaction
with
our
prospects
and
surroundings
then
mother
inquired
as
delicately
as
possible
what
denominations
religious
and
medical
we
were
of
how
many
children
we
had
and
whether
mostly
boys
or
girls
and
where
and
how
long
we
had
been
married
she
was
glad
she
said
that
we
had
taken
the
place
next
them
after
our
brief
sojourn
in
the
furnished
house
where
we
had
first
lived
and
said
that
there
was
only
one
objection
to
the
locality
which
was
the
prevalence
of
moths
they
obliged
you
to
put
away
your
things
in
almost
the
moment
the
spring
opened
she
wished
to
know
what
books
my
wife
was
presently
reading
and
whether
she
approved
of
women
clubs
to
the
extent
that
they
were
carried
to
in
some
places
she
believed
in
book
clubs
but
to
her
mind
it
was
very
questionable
whether
the
time
that
ladies
gave
to
writing
papers
on
so
many
different
subjects
was
well
spent
she
thought
it
a
pity
that
so
many
things
were
canned
nowadays
and
so
well
canned
that
the
old
arts
of
pickling
and
preserving
were
almost
entirely
lost
in
the
conversation
where
she
bore
a
leading
part
as
long
as
she
remained
in
the
room
her
mind
took
a
wide
range
and
visited
more
human
interests
than
my
wife
was
at
first
able
to
mention
though
afterward
she
remembered
so
many
that
i
formed
the
notion
of
something
encyclopedic
in
its
compass
when
she
reached
the
letter
z
she
rose
and
took
leave
of
my
wife
saying
that
now
she
must
go
and
lie
down
as
it
appeared
to
be
her
invariable
custom
to
do
in
behalf
of
the
robust
health
which
she
had
inherited
unimpaired
from
a
new
england
ancestry
at
exactly
four
every
afternoon
it
was
this
she
said
more
than
any
one
thing
that
enabled
her
to
go
through
so
much
as
she
did
but
through
the
door
which
she
left
open
behind
her
my
wife
heard
talbert
voice
saying
in
mixed
mockery
and
tenderness
do
forget
your
tonic
mother
and
hers
saying
no
i
wo
cyrus
i
never
forget
it
and
it
a
great
pity
you
do
take
it
it
was
our
conclusion
from
all
the
facts
of
this
call
when
we
came
to
discuss
them
in
the
light
of
some
friendly
gossip
which
we
had
previously
heard
that
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
talberts
came
honestly
by
her
love
of
ruling
if
she
got
it
from
her
grandmother
but
that
she
was
able
to
indulge
it
oftener
and
yet
not
so
often
as
might
have
been
supposed
from
the
mild
reticence
of
her
mother
older
if
not
shrewder
observers
than
ourselves
declared
that
what
went
in
that
house
was
what
talbert
said
and
that
it
went
all
the
more
effectively
because
what
she
said
talbert
said
too
that
might
have
been
because
she
said
so
little
when
her
mother
left
the
room
she
let
a
silence
follow
in
which
she
seemed
too
embarrassed
to
speak
for
a
while
on
finding
herself
alone
with
my
wife
and
my
wife
decided
that
the
shyness
of
the
girl
whose
engagement
was
soon
afterward
reported
as
well
as
the
of
the
eldest
son
had
come
from
their
mother
as
soon
as
talbert
could
command
herself
she
began
to
talk
and
every
word
she
said
was
full
of
sense
with
a
little
gust
of
humor
in
the
sense
which
was
perfectly
charming
absolutely
unworldly
as
she
was
she
had
very
good
manners
in
her
evasive
way
she
was
certainly
qualified
to
be
the
leader
of
society
in
eastridge
and
socially
eastridge
thought
fairly
well
of
itself
she
did
not
obviously
pretend
to
so
much
literature
as
her
mother
but
she
showed
an
even
nicer
intelligence
of
our
own
situation
in
eastridge
she
spoke
with
a
quiet
appreciation
of
the
improvement
in
the
banner
which
although
she
quoted
talbert
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
her
personal
acquaintance
with
the
paper
in
the
past
as
well
as
the
present
my
wife
pronounced
her
the
ideal
mother
of
a
family
and
just
what
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
cyrus
talbert
ought
to
be
but
no
doubt
because
characteristics
were
not
so
salient
as
her
mother
my
wife
was
less
definitely
descriptive
of
her
from
time
to
time
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
sister
of
who
visited
in
the
family
but
was
now
away
on
one
of
the
many
other
visits
in
which
she
passed
her
life
she
was
always
going
or
coming
somewhere
but
at
the
moment
she
was
gone
my
wife
inferred
from
the
generation
to
which
her
brother
belonged
that
she
had
long
been
a
lady
of
that
age
when
ladies
begin
to
be
spoken
of
as
maiden
talbert
spoke
of
her
as
if
they
were
better
friends
than
are
apt
to
be
and
said
that
she
was
to
be
with
them
soon
and
she
would
bring
her
with
her
when
she
returned
my
wife
call
from
the
general
impression
in
eastridge
we
gathered
that
miss
talbert
was
not
without
the
disappointment
which
endears
maiden
ladies
to
the
imagination
but
the
disappointment
was
of
a
date
so
remote
that
it
was
only
matter
of
pathetic
hearsay
now
miss
talbert
in
her
much
going
and
coming
had
not
failed
of
being
several
times
in
europe
she
especially
affected
florence
where
she
was
believed
to
have
studied
the
tuscan
school
to
unusual
purpose
though
this
was
not
apparent
in
any
work
of
her
own
we
formed
the
notion
that
she
might
be
uncomfortably
cultured
but
when
she
came
to
call
with
talbert
afterward
my
wife
reported
that
you
would
not
have
thought
except
for
a
remark
she
dropped
now
and
then
that
she
had
ever
been
out
of
her
central
new
york
village
and
so
far
from
putting
on
airs
of
art
she
did
not
speak
of
any
gallery
abroad
or
of
the
pensions
in
which
she
stayed
in
florence
or
the
hotels
in
other
cities
of
italy
where
she
had
stopped
to
visit
the
local
schools
of
painting
in
this
somewhat
protracted
excursion
i
have
not
forgotten
that
i
left
talbert
leaning
against
our
party
fence
with
his
arms
resting
on
the
top
after
a
keen
if
not
critical
survey
of
his
dwelling
he
did
not
take
up
our
talk
at
just
the
point
where
we
had
been
in
it
but
after
a
reflective
moment
he
said
i
do
remember
just
whether
temple
told
my
you
were
homoeopaths
or
well
i
said
that
depends
i
rather
think
we
are
homoeopaths
of
a
my
neighbor
face
confessed
a
certain
disappointment
but
we
are
not
bigoted
even
in
the
article
of
appreciable
doses
our
own
family
doctor
in
our
old
place
always
advised
us
in
stress
of
absence
from
him
to
get
the
best
doctor
wherever
we
happened
to
be
so
far
as
we
could
make
him
out
and
not
mind
what
school
he
was
of
i
suppose
we
have
been
treated
by
as
many
allopaths
as
homoeopaths
but
we
rather
a
healthy
family
and
put
it
all
together
we
have
not
been
treated
a
great
deal
by
talbert
looked
relieved
oh
then
you
will
have
denbigh
he
puts
your
rule
the
other
way
and
gets
the
best
patient
he
can
no
matter
whether
he
is
a
homoeopath
or
an
allopath
we
have
him
in
all
our
branches
he
is
the
best
doctor
in
eastridge
and
he
is
the
best
man
i
want
you
to
know
him
and
you
ca
know
a
doctor
the
way
you
ought
to
unless
he
your
family
you
quite
right
i
think
but
that
a
matter
i
should
have
to
leave
of
to
my
wife
women
are
of
the
patients
in
every
healthy
family
and
they
ought
to
have
the
ruling
voice
about
the
we
had
formed
the
habit
already
of
laughing
at
any
appearance
of
joke
in
each
other
and
my
neighbor
now
rolled
his
large
head
in
mirth
and
said
that
so
i
guess
but
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
temple
vote
when
she
sees
denbigh
his
specialty
is
the
capture
of
sensible
women
they
all
swear
by
him
you
met
him
did
you
at
my
office
the
other
day
oh
yes
and
i
liked
him
so
much
that
i
wished
i
was
sick
on
the
spot
that
good
my
neighbor
said
joyfully
well
you
could
meet
the
doctor
there
almost
any
afternoon
of
the
week
toward
hours
and
almost
any
evening
at
our
house
here
when
he
is
off
on
duty
it
a
generally
understood
thing
that
if
he
at
home
or
making
a
professional
visit
he
at
one
place
or
the
other
the
farmers
round
stop
for
him
with
their
buggies
when
they
in
a
hurry
and
half
our
calls
over
the
are
for
denbigh
the
fact
is
he
likes
to
talk
and
if
there
any
sort
of
man
that
like
to
talk
with
better
than
another
it
a
doctor
i
never
knew
one
yet
that
did
say
something
worth
while
within
five
minutes
time
then
you
know
that
you
can
be
free
with
them
be
yourself
and
that
always
worth
while
whether
you
worth
while
yourself
or
not
you
can
say
just
what
you
think
about
anybody
or
anything
and
you
know
it
go
farther
you
may
not
be
a
patient
but
they
always
got
their
hippocratic
oath
with
them
and
they
safe
that
so
my
neighbor
wished
the
pleasure
of
my
explicit
assent
my
tacit
assent
he
must
have
read
in
my
smile
yes
i
said
and
they
always
so
tolerant
and
compassionate
i
do
want
to
say
anything
against
the
reverend
clergy
they
oftener
saints
upon
earth
than
we
allow
but
a
doctor
is
more
solid
comfort
he
seems
to
understand
you
that
it
you
hit
it
he
seen
lots
of
other
cases
like
yours
and
next
to
a
man
feeling
that
he
a
peculiar
sufferer
he
likes
to
know
that
there
are
other
fellows
in
the
same
we
both
laughed
at
this
it
was
in
fact
a
joke
we
were
the
joint
authors
of
well
we
do
often
talk
about
my
ailments
i
have
got
a
great
many
and
generally
we
get
on
some
abstract
topic
just
now
running
the
question
of
female
education
perhaps
because
impersonal
and
we
can
both
treat
of
it
without
the
doctor
is
married
i
believe
he
a
widower
of
long
standing
and
that
the
best
kind
of
doctor
to
have
then
he
a
kind
of
a
bachelor
with
practical
wisdom
added
you
see
i
always
had
the
idea
that
women
beginning
with
little
girls
and
ending
with
grandmothers
ought
to
be
brought
up
as
nearly
like
their
brothers
as
can
be
that
is
if
they
are
to
be
the
wives
of
other
women
brothers
it
do
so
much
matter
how
an
old
maid
is
brought
up
but
you
ca
have
her
destiny
in
view
though
i
believe
if
an
old
maid
could
be
brought
up
more
like
an
old
bachelor
she
would
be
more
comfortable
to
herself
and
what
does
denbigh
say
well
you
must
hear
him
talk
i
guess
he
rather
wants
to
draw
me
out
for
the
most
i
do
wonder
at
that
i
wish
you
draw
yourself
out
i
thought
something
in
the
direction
of
your
opinion
have
you
that
good
we
tackle
the
doctor
together
sometime
the
difficulty
about
putting
a
thing
like
that
in
practice
is
that
you
have
to
in
it
with
women
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
old
way
a
man
wife
is
a
woman
generally
i
assented
as
if
for
argument
sake
he
gave
himself
time
to
laugh
and
she
has
the
charge
of
the
children
as
long
as
they
young
and
she
a
good
deal
more
likely
to
bring
up
the
boys
like
girls
than
the
girls
like
boys
but
the
boys
take
themselves
out
of
her
hands
pretty
soon
while
the
girls
have
to
stay
under
her
thumb
till
they
come
out
just
the
kind
of
women
we
always
we
managed
to
worry
along
with
yes
we
have
and
i
do
say
but
what
we
fancy
them
as
they
are
when
we
first
begin
to
notice
one
trouble
is
that
children
are
sick
so
much
and
their
mothers
scare
you
with
that
and
you
have
the
courage
to
put
your
theories
into
practice
i
ca
say
that
any
of
my
girls
have
inherited
my
constitution
but
this
i
knew
he
meant
the
one
whose
engagement
was
the
origin
of
our
conversation
if
heard
my
talk
about
her
constitution
you
would
think
she
belonged
to
the
healthiest
family
that
ever
got
out
of
new
england
alive
but
the
fact
is
there
always
something
the
matter
with
her
or
she
thinks
there
is
and
she
taking
medicine
for
it
anyway
i
say
but
what
my
wife
has
always
been
strong
enough
and
i
been
satisfied
to
have
the
children
take
after
her
but
when
i
saw
this
as
we
used
to
call
it
before
we
admired
red
hair
i
knew
she
was
a
talbert
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
begin
my
system
with
he
laughed
as
with
a
sense
of
agreeable
discomfiture
i
ca
say
it
worked
very
well
or
rather
that
it
had
a
chance
you
see
her
mother
had
to
apply
it
i
was
always
too
busy
and
a
curious
thing
was
that
though
the
girl
looked
like
me
she
was
a
good
deal
more
like
her
mother
in
temperament
and
perhaps
i
ventured
that
the
reason
why
she
was
your
he
dropped
his
head
in
rather
a
shamefaced
way
but
lifted
it
with
another
laugh
well
there
may
be
something
in
that
not
he
gravely
retrieved
himself
that
we
have
ever
distinguished
between
our
no
neither
have
we
but
one
ca
help
liking
the
ways
of
one
child
better
than
another
one
will
rather
take
the
fancy
more
than
the
well
my
neighbor
owned
i
do
know
but
it
that
kind
of
shyness
in
them
both
i
suppose
one
likes
to
think
his
girl
looks
like
him
but
does
mind
her
being
like
her
mother
i
glad
she
got
my
constitution
though
my
eldest
daughter
is
more
like
her
grandmother
in
looks
and
i
guess
she
got
her
disposition
too
more
i
do
know
he
said
vaguely
what
the
last
one
is
going
to
be
like
she
seems
to
be
more
worldly
but
he
resumed
strenuously
as
if
the
remembrance
of
old
opposition
remained
in
his
nerves
when
it
came
to
this
going
off
to
school
or
college
or
whatever
i
put
my
foot
down
and
kept
it
down
i
guess
her
mother
was
willing
enough
to
do
my
way
but
her
sister
was
all
for
some
of
those
colleges
where
girls
are
educated
with
other
girls
and
not
with
young
men
she
said
they
were
more
ladylike
and
a
lot
more
stuff
and
nonsense
and
were
more
likely
to
be
fit
for
society
she
said
this
one
would
meet
a
lot
of
jays
and
very
likely
fall
in
love
with
one
and
when
we
first
heard
of
this
affair
of
peggy
i
believe
but
what
her
sister
got
more
satisfaction
out
of
it
than
i
did
she
quick
enough
and
a
woman
likes
to
feel
that
she
a
prophetess
at
any
time
of
her
life
that
about
all
that
seems
to
keep
some
of
them
going
when
they
get
i
knew
that
here
he
had
his
rather
than
his
daughter
in
mind
and
i
did
interrupt
the
sarcastic
silence
into
which
he
fell
you
never
met
the
young
man
i
believe
he
asked
at
quite
another
point
and
to
the
negation
of
my
look
he
added
to
be
sure
we
hardly
met
him
ourselves
he
only
been
here
once
but
you
see
him
you
and
temple
well
he
lifted
his
head
as
if
he
were
going
away
but
he
did
not
lift
his
arms
from
the
fence
and
so
i
knew
that
he
had
not
emptied
the
bag
of
his
unexpected
confidences
i
did
not
know
why
he
was
making
them
to
me
but
i
liked
him
the
better
for
them
and
tried
to
feel
that
i
was
worthy
of
them
he
began
with
a
laugh
they
both
paid
it
into
me
so
and
now
i
knew
that
he
meant
his
eldest
daughter
as
well
as
her
grandmother
that
my
wife
turned
round
and
took
my
part
and
said
it
was
the
very
best
thing
that
could
happen
and
she
used
all
the
arguments
that
i
had
used
with
her
when
she
had
her
misgivings
about
it
and
she
did
leave
them
a
word
to
say
a
curious
thing
about
it
was
that
though
my
arguments
seemed
to
convince
them
they
did
convince
me
ever
notice
how
when
another
person
repeats
what
you
said
it
sounds
kind
of
weak
and
foolish
i
owned
that
my
reasons
had
at
times
some
such
way
of
turning
against
me
from
the
mouths
of
others
and
he
went
on
but
they
seemed
to
silence
her
own
misgivings
and
she
been
enthusiastic
for
the
engagement
ever
since
what
the
reason
he
asked
why
a
man
if
he
any
way
impetuous
wants
to
back
out
of
a
situation
just
about
the
time
a
woman
has
got
set
in
it
like
the
everlasting
hills
is
it
because
she
feels
the
need
of
holding
fast
for
both
or
is
it
because
she
knows
she
the
strength
to
keep
to
her
conclusion
if
she
wavers
at
all
while
a
man
can
let
himself
play
back
and
forth
and
still
stay
well
in
a
question
like
that
i
said
and
i
won
my
neighbor
easy
laugh
i
always
like
to
give
my
own
sex
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
i
have
any
question
but
man
inconsistency
is
always
attributable
to
his
i
guess
i
shall
have
to
put
that
up
on
the
doctor
my
neighbor
said
as
he
lifted
his
arms
from
the
fence
at
last
and
backed
away
from
it
i
knew
that
he
was
really
going
now
and
that
i
must
come
out
with
what
was
in
my
mind
if
i
meant
to
say
it
at
all
and
so
i
said
there
something
you
know
i
do
go
in
much
for
called
society
journalism
especially
in
the
country
press
where
it
mostly
takes
the
form
of
sadie
myers
is
visiting
with
miss
mamie
peters
but
i
realize
that
a
country
paper
nowadays
must
be
a
kind
of
open
letter
to
the
neighborhood
and
i
suppose
you
have
no
objection
to
my
mentioning
the
engagement
this
made
talbert
look
serious
and
i
fancy
my
proposition
made
him
realize
the
affair
as
he
had
not
before
perhaps
after
a
pause
he
said
well
that
something
i
should
like
to
talk
with
my
wife
do
so
i
applauded
i
only
suggest
it
or
chiefly
or
partly
because
you
can
have
it
reach
our
public
in
just
the
form
you
want
and
the
rochester
and
syracuse
papers
will
copy
my
paragraph
but
if
you
leave
it
to
their
eastridge
correspondents
that
true
he
assented
i
speak
to
talbert
he
walked
so
inconclusively
away
that
i
was
not
surprised
to
have
him
turn
and
come
back
before
i
left
my
place
why
certainly
make
the
announcement
it
got
to
come
out
it
a
kind
of
a
wrench
thinking
of
it
as
a
public
affair
because
a
man
daughter
is
always
a
little
girl
to
him
and
he
ca
realize
and
this
one
but
of
course
would
you
like
to
suggest
any
particular
form
of
words
i
hesitated
oh
no
leave
that
to
you
entirely
i
know
we
can
trust
you
not
to
make
any
blare
about
it
just
say
that
they
were
i
should
like
that
to
be
known
so
that
people
think
i
do
like
to
have
it
known
and
that
he
looking
forward
to
a
professorship
in
the
same
college
how
queer
it
all
seems
very
well
then
i
announce
it
in
our
next
there
time
to
send
me
word
if
talbert
has
any
all
right
but
she
wo
have
any
well
i
said
from
my
side
of
the
fence
and
when
i
had
watched
him
definitively
i
turned
and
walked
into
my
own
house
the
first
thing
my
wife
said
was
you
have
asked
him
to
let
you
announce
it
in
the
banner
but
i
have
though
well
she
gasped
what
is
the
matter
i
demanded
it
a
public
affair
is
it
it
a
family
affair
well
i
consider
the
readers
of
the
banner
a
part
of
the
ii
the
aunt
by
mary
wilkins
freeman
i
am
relegated
here
in
eastridge
to
the
position
in
which
i
suppose
i
properly
belong
and
i
dare
say
it
is
for
my
best
spiritual
and
temporal
good
here
i
am
the
aunt
not
a
day
not
an
hour
not
a
minute
when
i
am
with
other
people
passes
that
i
do
not
see
myself
in
their
estimation
playing
that
role
as
plainly
as
if
i
saw
myself
in
a
it
is
a
moral
lesson
which
i
presume
i
need
i
have
just
returned
from
my
visit
at
the
pollards
in
lancaster
where
i
most
assuredly
did
not
have
it
i
do
not
think
i
deceive
myself
i
know
it
is
the
popular
opinion
that
old
maids
are
exceedingly
prone
to
deceive
themselves
concerning
the
endurance
of
their
youth
and
charms
and
the
views
of
other
people
with
regard
to
them
but
i
am
willing
even
anxious
to
be
quite
frank
with
myself
since
well
never
mind
since
what
time
i
have
not
cared
an
iota
whether
i
was
considered
an
old
maid
or
not
the
situation
has
seemed
to
me
rather
amusing
inasmuch
as
it
has
involved
a
secret
willingness
to
be
what
everybody
has
considered
me
as
very
unwilling
to
be
i
have
regarded
it
as
a
sort
of
joke
upon
other
people
but
i
think
i
am
honest
i
really
mean
to
be
and
i
think
i
am
when
i
say
that
outside
eastridge
the
role
of
an
aunt
is
the
very
last
one
which
i
can
take
to
any
advantage
here
i
am
estimated
according
to
what
people
think
i
am
rather
than
what
i
actually
am
in
the
first
place
i
am
only
fifteen
years
older
than
peggy
who
has
just
become
engaged
but
those
fifteen
years
seem
countless
aeons
to
the
child
herself
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
i
am
ten
years
younger
than
my
brother
wife
but
she
and
my
brother
regard
me
as
old
enough
to
be
her
mother
as
for
grandmother
evarts
she
fairly
looks
up
to
me
as
her
superior
in
age
although
she
does
patronize
me
she
would
patronize
the
prophets
of
old
i
do
believe
she
ever
says
her
prayers
without
infusing
a
little
patronage
into
her
petitions
the
other
day
grandmother
evarts
actually
inquired
of
me
of
me
concerning
a
i
had
half
a
mind
to
retort
would
you
like
a
lesson
in
bridge
dear
old
soul
she
never
heard
of
bridge
and
i
suppose
she
would
have
thought
i
meant
i
sometimes
wonder
why
it
is
that
all
my
brother
family
are
so
singularly
unsophisticated
even
cyrus
himself
able
as
he
is
and
dear
as
he
is
sometimes
i
speculate
as
to
whether
it
can
be
due
to
the
of
their
house
i
have
always
had
a
theory
that
inanimate
things
exerted
more
of
an
influence
over
people
than
they
dreamed
and
a
to
my
mind
belongs
to
a
period
which
was
most
unsophisticated
and
fatuous
not
merely
concerning
aesthetics
but
simple
comfort
those
bedrooms
under
the
are
miracles
not
only
of
ugliness
but
discomfort
and
there
is
no
attic
i
think
that
a
house
without
a
good
roomy
attic
is
like
a
man
without
brains
possibly
living
in
a
brainless
house
has
affected
the
mental
outlook
of
my
relatives
although
their
brains
are
well
enough
peggy
is
not
exactly
remarkable
for
hers
but
she
is
charmingly
pretty
and
has
a
wonderful
knack
at
putting
on
her
clothes
which
might
be
esteemed
a
purely
feminine
brain
in
her
fingers
charles
edward
really
has
brains
although
he
is
a
round
peg
in
a
square
hole
and
as
for
alice
her
brains
are
above
the
normal
although
she
unfortunately
knows
it
and
billy
if
he
ever
gets
away
from
alice
will
show
what
he
is
made
of
maria
intellect
is
all
right
although
cast
in
a
petty
mould
she
repeats
grandmother
evarts
which
is
a
pity
because
there
are
types
not
worth
repeating
maria
if
she
had
not
her
husband
tom
to
manage
would
simply
fall
on
her
face
it
goes
hard
with
a
purely
patronizing
soul
when
there
is
nobody
to
manage
there
is
apt
to
be
an
explosion
however
maria
has
tom
but
none
of
my
brother
family
not
even
my
dear
cyrus
wife
have
the
right
point
of
view
with
regard
to
the
present
possibly
on
account
of
the
which
has
overshadowed
them
they
do
not
know
that
today
an
aunt
is
as
much
of
an
anomaly
as
a
that
she
has
ceased
to
exist
that
she
is
prehistoric
that
even
grandmothers
have
almost
disappeared
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
in
short
they
do
not
know
that
i
am
not
an
aunt
except
under
this
blessed
and
some
other
roofs
of
eastridge
many
of
which
are
also
mansard
where
the
influence
of
their
fixed
belief
prevails
for
instance
they
told
the
people
next
door
who
have
moved
here
recently
that
the
aunt
was
coming
and
so
when
i
went
to
call
with
my
temple
saw
her
quite
distinctly
to
think
of
ned
temple
being
married
to
a
woman
like
that
who
takes
things
on
trust
and
does
not
use
her
own
eyes
her
two
little
girls
are
exactly
like
her
i
wonder
what
ned
himself
will
think
i
wonder
if
he
will
see
that
my
hair
is
as
as
peggy
that
i
am
quite
as
slim
that
there
is
not
a
line
on
my
face
that
i
still
keep
my
girl
color
with
no
aid
that
i
wear
frills
of
the
latest
fashion
and
look
no
older
than
when
he
first
saw
me
i
really
do
not
know
myself
how
i
have
managed
to
remain
so
intact
possibly
because
i
have
always
grasped
all
the
minor
sweets
of
life
even
if
i
could
not
have
the
really
big
ones
i
honestly
do
not
think
that
i
have
had
the
latter
but
i
have
not
taken
the
position
of
some
people
that
if
i
can
not
have
what
i
want
most
i
will
have
nothing
i
have
taken
whatever
providence
chose
to
give
me
in
the
way
of
small
sweets
and
made
the
most
of
them
then
i
have
had
much
womanly
pride
and
that
is
a
powerful
tonic
for
instance
years
ago
when
my
best
lamp
of
life
went
out
so
to
speak
i
lit
all
my
candles
and
kept
my
path
i
took
just
as
much
pains
with
my
hair
and
my
dress
and
if
i
was
unhappy
i
kept
it
out
of
evidence
on
my
face
i
let
my
heart
ache
and
bleed
but
i
would
have
died
before
i
wrinkled
my
forehead
and
dimmed
my
eyes
with
tears
and
let
everybody
else
know
that
was
about
the
time
when
i
met
ned
temple
and
he
fell
so
madly
in
love
with
me
and
threatened
to
shoot
himself
if
i
would
not
marry
him
he
did
not
most
men
do
not
i
wonder
if
he
placed
me
when
he
heard
of
my
anticipated
coming
probably
he
did
not
they
have
probably
alluded
to
me
as
dear
old
aunt
elizabeth
and
when
he
met
me
i
was
staying
at
harriet
munroe
before
she
was
married
nobody
called
me
elizabeth
but
lily
miss
elizabeth
talbert
instead
of
lily
talbert
might
naturally
set
him
wrong
everybody
here
calls
me
elizabeth
outside
eastridge
i
am
lily
i
dare
say
ned
temple
has
not
dreamed
who
i
am
i
hear
that
he
is
quite
brilliant
although
the
poor
fellow
must
be
limited
as
to
his
income
however
in
some
respects
it
must
be
just
as
well
it
would
be
a
great
trial
to
a
man
with
a
large
income
to
have
a
wife
like
temple
who
could
make
no
good
use
of
it
you
might
load
that
poor
soul
with
crown
jewels
and
she
would
make
them
look
as
if
she
had
bought
them
at
a
department
store
for
cents
and
the
way
she
keeps
her
house
must
be
maddening
i
should
think
to
a
brilliant
man
fancy
the
books
on
the
table
being
all
arranged
with
the
large
ones
under
the
small
ones
in
perfectly
even
piles
i
am
sure
that
he
has
his
meals
on
time
and
i
am
equally
sure
that
the
principal
dishes
are
preserves
and
hot
biscuits
and
cake
that
sort
of
diet
simply
shows
forth
in
temple
and
her
children
i
am
sure
that
his
socks
are
always
mended
but
i
know
that
he
always
wipes
his
feet
before
he
enters
the
house
that
it
has
become
a
matter
of
conscience
with
him
and
those
exactions
are
to
me
pathetic
these
reflections
are
uncommonly
like
the
popular
conception
as
to
how
an
aunt
should
reflect
had
she
not
ceased
to
exist
sometimes
i
wish
she
were
still
existing
and
that
i
carried
out
her
character
to
the
full
i
am
not
at
all
sure
but
she
as
she
once
was
coming
here
would
not
have
brought
more
happiness
than
i
have
i
must
say
i
thought
so
when
i
saw
poor
harry
goward
turn
so
pale
when
he
first
saw
me
after
my
arrival
why
in
the
name
of
ada
my
when
she
wrote
to
me
at
the
pollards
announcing
peggy
engagement
could
not
have
mentioned
who
the
man
was
i
can
not
see
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
only
the
girl
and
the
engagement
figure
at
all
in
such
matters
i
suppose
peggy
always
alluded
to
me
as
dear
aunt
elizabeth
when
that
poor
young
fellow
knew
me
at
the
abercrombies
where
we
were
staying
a
year
ago
as
miss
lily
talbert
the
situation
with
regard
to
him
and
peggy
fairly
puzzles
me
i
simply
do
not
know
what
to
do
goodness
knows
i
never
lifted
my
finger
to
attract
him
flirtations
between
older
women
and
boys
always
have
seemed
to
me
contemptible
i
never
particularly
noticed
him
although
he
is
a
charming
young
fellow
and
there
is
not
as
much
difference
in
our
ages
as
in
those
of
harriet
munroe
and
her
husband
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
there
is
more
difference
between
the
ages
of
ned
temple
and
his
wife
poor
soul
she
looks
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
as
i
remember
him
but
that
may
be
partly
due
to
the
way
she
arranges
her
hair
however
ned
himself
may
have
changed
there
must
be
considerable
wear
and
tear
about
matrimony
taken
in
connection
with
editing
a
country
newspaper
if
i
had
married
ned
i
might
have
looked
as
old
as
temple
does
i
wonder
what
ned
will
do
when
he
sees
me
i
know
he
will
not
turn
white
as
poor
harry
goward
did
that
really
worries
me
i
am
fond
of
little
peggy
and
the
situation
is
really
rather
awful
she
is
engaged
to
a
man
who
is
fond
of
her
aunt
and
can
not
conceal
it
still
the
affection
of
most
male
things
is
curable
if
peggy
has
sense
enough
to
retain
her
love
for
frills
and
bows
and
puts
on
her
clothes
as
well
and
arranges
her
hair
as
prettily
after
she
has
been
married
a
year
no
ten
years
it
will
take
at
least
ten
years
to
make
a
proper
aunt
of
me
she
may
have
the
innings
but
peggy
has
no
brains
and
it
really
takes
a
woman
with
brains
to
keep
her
looks
after
matrimony
of
course
the
poor
little
soul
has
no
danger
to
fear
from
me
it
is
lucky
for
her
that
her
fiance
fell
in
love
with
me
but
it
is
the
principle
of
the
thing
which
worries
me
harry
goward
must
be
as
fickle
as
a
there
is
no
assurance
whatever
for
peggy
that
he
will
not
fall
headlong
in
love
and
headlong
is
just
the
word
for
it
with
any
other
woman
after
he
has
married
her
i
did
not
want
the
poor
fellow
to
stick
to
me
but
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
that
is
the
trouble
how
i
am
it
is
his
perverted
fickleness
rather
than
his
actual
fickleness
which
worries
me
he
has
proposed
to
peggy
when
he
was
in
love
with
another
woman
probably
because
he
was
in
love
with
another
woman
now
peggy
although
she
is
not
brilliant
in
spite
of
her
perhaps
because
of
it
is
a
darling
and
she
deserves
a
good
husband
she
loves
this
man
with
her
whole
heart
poor
little
thing
that
is
easy
enough
to
be
seen
and
he
does
not
care
for
her
at
least
not
when
i
am
around
or
when
i
am
in
his
mind
the
question
is
is
this
marriage
going
to
make
the
child
happy
my
first
impulse
when
i
saw
harry
goward
and
knew
that
he
was
poor
peggy
lover
was
immediately
to
pack
up
and
leave
then
i
really
wondered
if
that
was
the
wisest
thing
to
do
i
wanted
to
see
for
myself
if
harry
goward
were
really
in
earnest
about
poor
little
peggy
and
had
gotten
over
his
mad
infatuation
for
her
aunt
and
would
make
her
a
good
husband
perhaps
i
ought
to
leave
and
yet
i
wonder
if
i
ought
harry
goward
may
have
turned
pale
simply
from
his
memory
of
what
an
uncommon
fool
he
had
been
and
the
consideration
of
the
embarrassing
position
in
which
his
past
folly
has
placed
him
if
i
chose
to
make
revelations
he
might
have
known
that
i
would
not
still
men
know
so
little
of
women
i
think
that
possibly
i
am
worrying
myself
needlessly
and
that
he
is
really
in
love
with
peggy
she
is
quite
a
little
beauty
and
she
does
know
how
to
put
her
clothes
on
so
charmingly
the
adjustments
of
her
are
simply
perfection
i
may
be
very
foolish
to
go
away
i
may
be
even
insufferably
conceited
in
assuming
that
harry
change
of
color
signified
anything
which
could
make
it
necessary
but
after
all
he
must
be
fickle
and
ready
to
turn
from
one
to
another
or
deceitful
and
i
must
admit
that
if
peggy
were
my
daughter
and
harry
had
never
been
mad
about
me
six
weeks
ago
but
about
some
other
woman
i
should
still
feel
the
same
way
sometimes
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
tell
ada
she
is
the
girl
mother
i
might
shift
the
responsibility
on
to
her
i
almost
think
i
will
she
is
alone
in
her
room
now
i
know
peggy
and
harry
have
gone
for
a
drive
and
the
rest
have
scattered
it
is
a
good
chance
i
really
do
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
alone
i
will
go
this
minute
and
tell
ada
well
i
have
told
ada
and
here
i
am
back
in
my
room
laughing
over
the
result
i
might
as
well
have
told
the
anything
like
ease
of
character
and
inability
to
worry
or
even
face
a
disturbing
situation
i
have
never
seen
i
laugh
although
her
method
of
receiving
my
tale
was
not
so
to
speak
flattering
to
me
ada
was
in
her
loose
white
kimono
and
she
was
sitting
at
her
shady
window
darning
stockings
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
a
cow
chews
her
cud
and
when
i
told
her
under
promise
of
the
strictest
secrecy
she
just
laughed
that
placid
little
laugh
of
hers
and
said
taking
another
stitch
oh
well
boys
are
always
falling
in
love
with
older
and
when
i
asked
if
she
thought
seriously
that
peggy
might
not
be
running
a
risk
she
said
oh
dear
no
harry
is
devoted
to
the
child
you
ca
be
foolish
enough
aunt
elizabeth
to
think
that
he
is
in
love
with
you
now
i
said
certainly
it
was
only
the
principle
involved
that
the
young
man
must
be
very
changeable
and
that
peggy
might
run
a
risk
in
the
future
if
harry
were
thrown
in
much
with
other
women
ada
only
laughed
again
and
kept
on
with
her
darning
and
said
she
guessed
there
was
no
need
to
worry
harry
seemed
to
her
very
much
like
cyrus
and
she
was
sure
that
cyrus
had
never
thought
of
another
woman
besides
herself
ada
i
wonder
if
another
woman
would
have
said
what
i
might
have
said
especially
after
that
imputation
of
the
idiocy
of
my
thinking
that
a
young
man
could
possibly
fancy
me
i
said
nothing
but
i
wondered
what
ada
would
say
if
she
knew
what
i
knew
if
she
would
continue
to
chew
her
cud
that
cyrus
had
been
simply
mad
over
another
girl
and
only
married
her
because
he
could
not
get
the
other
one
and
when
the
other
died
five
years
after
he
was
married
to
ada
he
sent
flowers
and
i
should
not
to
this
day
venture
to
speak
that
girl
name
to
the
man
she
was
a
great
beauty
and
she
had
a
wonderful
witchery
about
her
i
was
only
a
child
but
i
remember
how
she
looked
why
i
fell
in
love
with
her
myself
cyrus
can
never
forget
a
woman
like
that
for
a
creature
like
ada
even
if
she
does
keep
his
house
in
order
and
make
a
good
mother
to
his
children
the
other
would
not
have
kept
the
house
in
order
at
all
but
it
would
have
been
a
shrine
cyrus
worshipped
that
girl
and
love
may
supplant
love
but
not
worship
ada
does
not
know
and
she
never
will
through
me
but
i
declare
i
was
almost
wicked
enough
to
tell
her
when
i
saw
her
placidly
darning
away
without
the
slightest
conception
any
more
than
a
feather
pillow
would
have
of
what
this
ridiculous
affair
with
me
might
mean
in
future
consequences
to
poor
innocent
little
peggy
but
i
can
only
hope
the
boy
has
gotten
over
his
feeling
for
me
that
he
has
been
really
changeable
for
that
would
be
infinitely
better
than
the
other
thing
well
i
shall
not
need
to
go
away
harry
goward
has
himself
solved
that
problem
he
goes
himself
he
has
invented
a
telegram
about
a
sick
uncle
all
according
to
the
very
best
melodrama
but
what
i
feared
is
true
he
is
still
as
mad
as
ever
about
me
i
went
down
to
the
for
the
evening
mail
and
was
coming
home
by
moonlight
unattended
as
any
undesirable
maiden
aunt
may
safely
do
when
the
boy
overtook
me
i
had
heard
his
hurried
steps
behind
me
for
some
time
up
he
rushed
just
as
we
reached
the
vacant
lot
before
the
temple
house
and
caught
my
arm
and
poured
forth
a
volume
of
confessions
and
avowals
and
in
short
told
me
he
did
not
love
peggy
but
me
and
he
never
would
love
anybody
but
me
i
actually
felt
faint
for
a
second
then
i
talked
i
told
him
what
a
dishonorable
wretch
he
was
and
said
he
might
as
well
have
plunged
a
knife
into
an
innocent
confiding
girl
at
once
as
to
have
treated
peggy
so
i
told
him
to
go
away
and
let
me
alone
and
write
friendly
letters
to
peggy
and
see
if
he
would
not
recover
his
senses
if
he
had
any
to
recover
which
i
thought
doubtful
and
then
when
he
said
he
would
not
budge
a
step
that
he
would
remain
in
eastridge
if
only
for
the
sake
of
breathing
the
same
air
i
did
that
he
would
tell
peggy
the
whole
truth
at
once
and
bear
all
the
blame
which
he
deserved
for
being
so
dishonorable
i
arose
to
the
occasion
i
said
very
well
remain
but
you
may
have
to
breathe
not
only
the
same
air
that
i
do
but
also
the
same
air
that
the
man
whom
i
am
to
marry
i
declare
that
i
had
no
man
whatever
in
mind
i
said
it
in
sheer
desperation
then
the
boy
burst
forth
with
another
torrent
and
the
secret
was
out
my
brother
and
my
and
grandmother
evarts
and
the
children
for
all
i
know
have
all
been
for
me
i
did
not
suspect
it
of
them
i
supposed
they
esteemed
my
case
as
utterly
hopeless
and
then
i
knew
that
cyrus
knew
about
well
never
mind
i
do
often
mention
him
to
myself
i
certainly
thought
that
they
all
would
have
as
soon
endeavored
to
raise
the
dead
as
to
marry
me
but
it
seems
that
they
have
been
thinking
that
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
or
rather
while
there
are
widowers
there
is
hope
and
there
is
a
widower
in
eastridge
denbigh
he
is
the
candle
about
which
the
mothlike
dreams
of
ancient
maidens
and
widows
have
fluttered
to
their
futile
singeing
for
the
last
twenty
years
i
really
did
not
dream
that
they
would
think
i
would
flutter
even
if
i
was
an
aunt
but
harry
cried
out
that
if
i
were
going
to
marry
denbigh
he
would
go
away
he
never
would
stay
and
be
a
witness
to
such
sacrilege
that
old
man
he
raved
and
when
i
said
i
was
not
a
young
girl
myself
he
got
all
the
madder
well
i
allowed
him
to
think
i
was
going
to
marry
denbigh
i
wonder
what
the
doctor
would
say
and
as
a
consequence
harry
will
flit
and
he
is
with
poor
little
peggy
out
in
the
and
she
is
crying
her
eyes
out
if
he
dares
tell
her
what
a
fool
he
is
i
could
kill
him
i
am
horribly
afraid
that
he
will
let
it
out
for
i
never
saw
such
an
alarmingly
impetuous
youth
young
lochinvar
out
of
the
west
was
mere
cambric
tea
to
him
i
am
really
thankful
that
he
has
not
a
gallant
steed
nor
even
an
automobile
for
the
aunt
might
yet
be
captured
as
the
sabine
women
were
well
thank
fortune
harry
has
left
and
he
can
not
have
told
for
poor
little
peggy
has
been
sitting
with
me
for
a
solid
hour
sniffing
and
sounding
his
praises
somehow
the
child
made
me
think
of
myself
at
her
age
i
was
about
a
year
older
when
my
tragedy
came
and
was
never
righted
hers
i
think
will
be
since
harry
was
not
such
an
ass
as
to
confess
before
he
went
away
but
all
the
same
i
am
concerned
for
her
happiness
for
harry
is
either
fickle
or
deceitful
sometimes
i
wonder
what
my
duty
is
but
i
ca
tell
the
child
it
would
do
no
more
good
for
me
to
consult
my
brother
cyrus
than
it
did
to
consult
ada
i
know
of
no
one
whom
i
can
consult
charles
edward
and
his
wife
who
is
just
like
ada
pretty
but
always
with
her
hunching
in
the
back
sitting
wrong
and
standing
lopsided
and
not
worrying
enough
to
give
her
character
salt
and
pepper
are
there
i
should
think
she
would
drive
charles
edward
who
is
really
an
artist
only
out
of
his
proper
sphere
mad
tom
and
maria
are
down
there
too
on
the
piazza
and
ada
at
her
everlasting
darning
and
alice
bossing
billy
as
usual
i
can
hear
her
voice
i
think
i
will
put
on
another
gown
and
go
for
a
walk
i
think
i
will
put
on
my
pink
linen
and
my
hat
lined
with
pink
chiffon
and
trimmed
with
shaded
roses
that
particular
shade
of
pink
is
just
right
for
my
hair
i
know
quite
well
how
i
look
in
that
gown
and
hat
and
i
know
also
quite
well
how
i
shall
look
to
the
members
of
my
family
assembled
below
they
all
unanimously
consider
that
i
should
dress
always
in
black
silk
and
a
bonnet
with
a
neat
little
tuft
of
violets
and
black
ribbons
tied
under
my
chin
i
know
i
am
wicked
to
put
on
that
pink
gown
and
hat
but
i
shall
do
it
i
wonder
why
it
amuses
me
to
be
made
fun
of
thank
fortune
i
have
a
sense
of
humor
if
i
did
not
have
that
it
might
have
come
to
the
black
silk
and
the
bonnet
with
the
tuft
of
violets
for
the
lord
knows
i
have
not
after
all
so
very
much
compared
with
what
some
women
have
it
troubles
me
to
think
of
that
young
fool
rushing
away
and
poor
dear
little
peggy
but
what
can
i
do
this
pink
gown
is
fetching
and
how
they
will
stare
when
i
go
down
well
they
did
stare
how
pretty
this
street
is
with
the
elms
arching
over
it
i
made
quite
a
commotion
and
they
all
saw
me
through
their
eyeglasses
of
prejudice
except
possibly
tom
price
maria
husband
i
am
certain
i
heard
him
say
as
i
marched
away
well
i
do
care
she
does
look
stunning
anyhow
but
maria
hushed
him
up
i
heard
her
say
pink
at
her
age
and
a
pink
hat
and
a
parasol
lined
with
pink
ada
really
looked
more
disturbed
than
i
have
ever
seen
her
if
i
had
been
godiva
going
for
my
sacrificial
ride
through
the
town
it
could
not
have
been
much
worse
she
made
her
eyes
round
and
big
and
asked
in
a
voice
which
was
really
agitated
are
you
going
out
in
that
dress
aunt
elizabeth
and
aunt
elizabeth
replied
that
she
certainly
was
and
she
went
after
she
had
exchanged
greetings
with
the
family
and
kissed
peggy
little
face
charles
edward
wife
actually
straightened
her
spinal
column
she
was
so
amazed
at
the
sight
of
me
in
my
array
charles
edward
to
do
him
justice
stared
at
me
with
a
bewildered
air
as
if
he
were
trying
to
reconcile
his
senses
with
his
traditions
he
is
an
artist
but
he
will
always
be
hampered
by
thinking
he
sees
what
he
has
been
brought
up
to
think
he
sees
that
is
the
reason
why
he
has
settled
down
uncomplainingly
in
cyrus
works
as
he
calls
them
doing
the
very
slight
aesthetics
possible
in
such
a
connection
now
charles
edward
would
think
that
sunburned
grass
over
in
that
field
is
green
when
it
is
pink
because
he
has
been
taught
that
grass
is
green
if
poor
charles
edward
only
knew
that
grass
was
green
not
of
itself
but
because
of
occasional
conditions
and
knew
that
his
aunt
looked
well
as
she
does
look
he
would
flee
for
his
life
and
that
which
is
better
than
his
life
from
the
works
and
be
an
artist
but
he
never
will
know
or
know
that
he
knows
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
well
what
does
it
matter
to
me
i
have
just
met
a
woman
who
stared
at
me
and
spoke
as
if
she
thought
i
were
a
lunatic
to
be
afield
in
this
array
what
does
anything
matter
sometimes
when
i
am
with
people
who
see
straight
i
do
take
a
certain
pleasure
in
looking
well
because
i
am
a
woman
and
nothing
can
quite
take
away
that
pleasure
from
me
but
all
the
time
i
know
it
does
not
matter
that
nothing
has
really
mattered
since
i
was
about
peggy
age
and
lyman
wilde
quarrelled
with
me
over
nothing
and
vanished
into
thin
air
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
suppose
he
is
comfortably
settled
with
a
wife
and
family
somewhere
it
is
rather
odd
though
that
with
all
my
wandering
on
this
side
of
the
water
and
the
other
i
have
never
once
crossed
his
tracks
he
may
be
in
the
far
east
with
a
harem
i
never
have
been
in
the
far
east
well
it
does
not
matter
to
me
where
he
is
that
is
ancient
history
on
the
whole
though
i
like
the
harem
idea
better
than
the
single
wife
i
have
what
is
left
to
me
the
little
things
of
life
the
pretty
effects
which
go
to
make
me
pretty
outside
eastridge
the
comforts
of
civilization
travelling
and
seeing
beautiful
things
also
seeing
ugly
things
to
enhance
the
beautiful
i
have
pleasant
days
in
beautiful
florence
i
have
friends
i
have
everything
except
well
except
everything
that
i
must
do
without
but
i
will
do
without
it
gracefully
with
never
a
whimper
or
i
know
myself
but
now
i
am
worried
over
peggy
i
wish
i
could
consult
with
somebody
with
sense
what
a
woman
i
am
i
mean
how
feminine
i
am
i
wish
i
could
cure
myself
of
the
habit
of
being
feminine
it
is
a
horrible
nuisance
this
wishing
to
consult
with
somebody
when
i
am
worried
is
so
disgustingly
feminine
well
i
have
consulted
i
am
back
in
my
own
room
it
is
after
supper
we
had
three
kinds
of
cake
hot
biscuits
and
raspberries
and
a
concession
to
cyrus
a
platter
of
cold
ham
and
an
egg
salad
he
will
have
something
hearty
as
he
calls
it
bless
him
he
is
a
for
supper
i
am
glad
for
i
should
starve
on
ada
new
england
menus
i
feel
better
now
that
i
have
consulted
although
when
i
really
consider
the
matter
i
ca
see
that
i
have
arrived
at
any
very
definite
issue
but
i
have
consulted
and
above
all
things
with
ned
temple
i
was
walking
down
the
street
and
i
reached
his
newspaper
building
it
is
a
funny
little
affair
looks
like
a
toy
house
it
is
all
given
up
to
the
mighty
affairs
of
the
eastridge
banner
in
front
there
is
a
piazza
and
on
this
piazza
sat
ned
temple
changed
well
yes
poor
fellow
he
is
thin
i
am
so
glad
he
is
thin
instead
of
fat
thinness
is
not
nearly
so
disillusioning
his
hair
is
but
he
is
after
all
and
his
manners
are
entirely
sophisticated
he
shows
at
a
glance
at
a
word
that
he
is
a
brilliant
man
although
he
is
stranded
upon
such
a
petty
little
editorial
island
and
and
he
saw
me
as
i
am
he
did
not
change
color
he
is
too
besides
he
is
too
honorable
but
he
saw
me
he
rose
immediately
and
came
to
speak
to
me
he
shook
hands
he
looked
at
my
face
under
my
hat
he
saw
it
as
it
was
but
bless
him
that
stupid
wife
of
his
holds
him
fast
with
his
own
honor
ned
temple
is
a
good
man
sometimes
i
wonder
if
it
would
not
have
been
better
if
he
instead
of
lyman
well
that
is
idiotic
he
said
he
had
to
go
to
the
and
then
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
home
to
supper
to
the
cake
and
sauce
i
suppose
and
with
my
permission
he
would
walk
with
me
so
he
did
i
do
know
how
it
happened
that
i
consulted
with
him
i
think
he
spoke
of
engagement
and
that
led
up
to
it
but
i
could
speak
to
him
because
i
knew
that
he
seeing
me
as
i
really
am
would
view
the
matter
seriously
i
told
him
about
the
miserable
affair
and
he
said
that
i
had
done
exactly
right
i
ca
remember
that
he
offered
any
actual
solution
but
it
was
something
to
be
told
that
i
had
done
exactly
right
and
then
he
spoke
of
his
wife
and
in
such
a
faithful
fashion
and
so
lovingly
of
his
two
commonplace
little
girls
ned
temple
is
as
good
as
he
is
brilliant
it
is
really
rather
astonishing
that
such
a
brilliant
man
can
be
so
good
he
told
me
that
i
had
not
changed
at
all
but
all
the
time
that
look
of
faithfulness
for
his
wife
never
left
his
handsome
face
bless
him
i
believe
i
am
nearer
loving
him
for
his
love
for
another
woman
than
i
ever
was
to
loving
him
for
himself
and
then
the
inconceivable
happened
i
did
what
i
never
thought
i
should
be
capable
of
doing
and
did
it
easily
too
without
i
am
sure
a
change
of
color
or
any
perturbation
i
think
i
could
do
it
because
faithfulness
had
become
so
a
matter
of
course
with
the
man
that
i
was
not
ashamed
should
he
have
any
suspicion
of
me
also
he
and
lyman
used
to
be
warm
friends
i
asked
if
he
knew
anything
about
him
he
met
my
question
as
if
i
had
asked
what
it
was
just
the
way
i
knew
he
would
meet
it
he
knows
no
more
than
i
do
but
he
said
something
which
has
comforted
me
although
comfort
at
this
stage
of
affairs
is
a
dangerous
indulgence
he
said
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
speaking
of
the
weather
he
worshipped
you
lily
and
wherever
he
is
in
this
world
or
the
next
he
worships
you
then
he
added
you
know
how
i
felt
about
you
lily
if
i
had
not
found
out
about
him
that
he
had
come
first
i
know
how
it
would
have
been
with
me
so
i
know
how
it
is
with
him
we
had
the
same
views
about
matters
of
that
kind
after
i
did
find
out
why
of
course
i
felt
different
although
always
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
be
a
dear
friend
to
you
lily
but
a
man
is
unfaithful
to
himself
who
is
faithful
to
a
woman
whom
another
man
loves
and
whom
she
yes
that
is
true
i
agreed
and
said
something
about
the
hours
for
the
mails
in
eastridge
lyman
wilde
dropped
out
of
ned
life
as
he
dropped
out
of
mine
it
seems
i
shall
simply
have
to
lean
back
upon
the
minor
joys
of
life
for
mental
and
physical
support
as
i
did
before
nothing
is
different
but
i
am
glad
that
i
have
seen
ned
temple
again
and
realize
what
a
good
man
he
is
well
it
seems
that
even
minor
pleasures
have
dangers
and
that
i
do
not
always
read
characters
rightly
the
very
evening
after
my
little
stroll
and
renewal
of
friendship
with
ned
temple
i
was
sitting
in
my
room
reading
a
new
book
for
which
the
author
should
have
capital
punishment
when
i
heard
excited
voices
or
rather
an
excited
voice
below
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
at
first
i
supposed
the
excited
voice
must
belong
to
either
maria
or
alice
for
no
others
of
my
brother
family
ever
seem
in
the
least
excited
not
to
the
extent
of
raising
their
voices
to
a
hysterical
pitch
but
after
a
few
minutes
cyrus
came
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
he
called
aunt
elizabeth
and
aunt
elizabeth
in
her
same
pink
frock
went
down
cyrus
met
me
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
he
looked
fairly
wild
what
on
earth
aunt
elizabeth
said
he
and
i
stared
at
him
in
a
daze
the
deuce
is
to
pay
said
he
aunt
elizabeth
did
you
ever
know
our
neighbor
before
his
marriage
certainly
said
i
when
we
were
both
infants
i
believe
they
had
gotten
him
out
of
petticoats
and
into
trousers
but
much
as
ever
and
my
skirts
were
still
abbreviated
it
was
at
harriet
munroe
before
she
was
have
you
been
to
walk
with
him
gasped
poor
cyrus
i
met
him
on
my
way
to
the
last
night
and
he
walked
along
with
me
and
then
as
far
as
his
house
on
the
way
home
if
you
call
that
walking
out
said
i
you
sound
like
the
paragraphs
in
a
daily
paper
now
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
if
i
may
ask
cyrus
nothing
except
temple
is
in
there
raising
a
devil
of
a
row
said
cyrus
he
gazed
at
me
in
a
bewildered
fashion
if
it
were
peggy
i
could
understand
it
he
said
helplessly
and
i
knew
how
distinctly
he
saw
the
aunt
as
he
gazed
at
me
she
jealous
of
you
elizabeth
he
went
on
in
the
same
dazed
fashion
she
jealous
of
you
because
her
husband
walked
home
with
you
she
a
dreadfully
nervous
woman
and
i
guess
none
too
well
she
fairly
wild
it
seems
temple
let
on
how
he
used
to
know
you
before
he
was
married
and
said
something
in
praise
of
your
looks
and
she
made
a
regular
header
into
conclusions
you
have
held
your
own
remarkably
well
elizabeth
but
i
declare
and
again
poor
cyrus
gazed
at
me
well
for
goodness
sake
let
me
go
in
and
see
what
i
can
do
said
i
and
with
that
i
went
into
the
parlor
i
was
taken
aback
nobody
not
even
another
woman
can
tell
what
a
woman
really
is
i
thought
i
had
estimated
ned
temple
wife
correctly
i
had
taken
her
for
a
monotonous
orderly
dull
sort
of
creature
quite
incapable
of
extremes
but
in
reality
she
has
in
her
rather
large
flabby
body
the
characteristics
of
a
kitten
with
the
possibilities
of
a
tigress
the
tigress
was
uppermost
when
i
entered
the
room
the
woman
was
as
irresponsible
as
a
savage
i
was
disgusted
and
sorry
and
furious
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
imagine
myself
making
such
a
spectacle
over
any
mortal
man
she
was
weeping
frantically
into
a
mussy
little
ball
of
handkerchief
and
when
she
saw
me
she
rushed
at
me
and
gripped
me
by
the
arm
like
a
mad
thing
if
you
ca
get
a
husband
for
yourself
said
she
you
might
at
least
let
other
women
husbands
alone
she
was
vulgar
but
she
was
so
wild
with
jealousy
that
i
suppose
vulgarity
ought
to
be
forgiven
her
i
hardly
know
myself
how
i
managed
it
but
somehow
i
got
the
poor
thing
out
of
the
room
and
the
house
and
into
the
cool
night
air
and
then
i
talked
to
her
and
fairly
made
her
be
quiet
and
listen
i
told
her
that
ned
temple
had
made
love
to
me
when
he
was
just
out
of
petticoats
and
i
was
in
short
dresses
i
stretched
or
shortened
the
truth
a
little
but
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
then
i
intimated
that
i
never
would
have
married
ned
temple
anyway
and
that
worked
beautifully
she
turned
upon
me
in
such
a
delightfully
inconsequent
fashion
and
demanded
to
know
what
i
expected
and
declared
her
husband
was
good
enough
for
any
woman
then
i
said
i
did
not
doubt
that
and
hinted
that
other
women
might
have
had
their
romances
even
if
they
did
not
marry
that
immediately
interested
her
she
stared
at
me
and
said
with
the
most
innocent
impertinence
that
my
brother
wife
had
intimated
that
i
had
had
an
unhappy
when
i
was
a
girl
i
did
not
think
that
cyrus
had
told
ada
but
i
suppose
a
man
has
to
tell
his
wife
everything
i
hedged
about
the
unhappy
but
the
first
thing
i
knew
the
poor
distracted
woman
was
sobbing
on
my
shoulder
as
we
stood
in
front
of
her
gate
and
saying
that
she
was
so
sorry
but
her
whole
life
was
bound
up
in
her
husband
and
i
was
so
beautiful
and
had
so
much
style
and
she
knew
what
a
dowdy
she
was
and
she
could
not
blame
poor
ned
if
but
i
hushed
her
your
husband
has
no
more
idea
of
caring
for
another
woman
besides
you
than
that
moon
has
of
travelling
around
another
world
said
i
and
you
are
a
fool
if
you
think
so
and
if
you
are
dowdy
it
is
your
own
fault
if
you
have
such
a
good
husband
you
owe
it
to
him
not
to
be
dowdy
i
know
you
keep
his
house
beautifully
but
any
man
would
rather
have
his
wife
look
well
than
his
house
if
he
is
worth
anything
at
then
she
gasped
out
that
she
wished
she
knew
how
to
do
up
her
hair
like
mine
it
was
all
highly
ridiculous
but
it
actually
ended
in
my
going
into
the
temple
house
and
showing
ned
wife
how
to
do
up
her
hair
like
mine
she
looked
like
another
woman
when
it
was
puffed
softly
over
her
forehead
she
has
quite
pretty
brown
hair
then
i
taught
her
how
to
put
on
her
corset
and
pin
her
taut
in
front
and
her
skirt
behind
ned
was
not
to
be
home
until
late
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
it
ended
in
her
fairly
purring
around
me
and
saying
how
sorry
she
was
and
ashamed
that
she
had
been
so
foolish
and
all
the
time
casting
little
covert
conceited
glances
at
herself
in
the
finally
i
kissed
her
and
she
kissed
me
and
i
went
home
i
do
really
see
what
more
a
woman
could
have
done
for
a
rival
who
had
supplanted
her
but
this
revelation
makes
me
more
sorry
than
ever
for
poor
ned
i
do
know
though
she
may
be
more
interesting
than
i
thought
anything
is
better
than
the
dead
level
of
small
books
on
large
ones
and
meals
on
time
it
can
not
be
exactly
monotonous
never
to
know
whether
you
will
find
a
sleek
purry
cat
or
an
absurd
kitten
or
a
tigress
when
you
come
home
luckily
she
did
not
tell
ned
of
her
jealousy
and
i
have
cautioned
all
in
my
family
to
hold
their
tongues
and
i
think
they
will
i
infer
that
they
suspect
that
i
must
have
been
guilty
of
some
unbecoming
elderly
prank
to
bring
about
such
a
state
of
affairs
unless
possibly
maria
husband
and
billy
are
exceptions
i
find
that
billy
when
alice
lets
him
alone
is
a
boy
who
sees
with
his
own
eyes
he
told
me
yesterday
that
i
was
handsomer
in
my
pink
dress
than
any
girl
in
his
school
why
billy
talbert
i
said
talking
that
way
to
your
old
aunt
i
suppose
you
are
awful
old
said
billy
bless
him
but
you
are
prettier
than
a
girl
i
hate
girls
i
hope
i
can
get
away
from
girls
when
i
am
a
i
wanted
to
tell
the
dear
boy
that
was
exactly
the
time
when
he
would
not
get
away
from
girls
but
i
thought
i
would
not
frighten
him
but
let
him
find
it
out
for
himself
well
now
the
deluge
it
is
a
week
since
harry
goward
went
away
and
peggy
has
not
had
a
letter
although
she
has
haunted
the
poor
child
and
this
morning
she
brought
home
a
letter
for
me
from
that
crazy
boy
she
was
white
as
chalk
when
she
handed
it
to
me
it
harry
writing
said
she
and
she
could
barely
whisper
i
have
not
had
a
word
from
him
since
he
went
away
and
now
he
has
written
to
you
instead
of
me
what
has
he
written
to
you
for
aunt
elizabeth
she
looked
at
me
so
piteously
poor
dear
little
girl
that
if
i
could
have
gotten
hold
of
harry
goward
that
moment
i
would
have
shaken
him
i
tried
to
speak
soothingly
i
said
my
dear
peggy
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
why
he
has
written
to
me
perhaps
his
uncle
is
dead
and
he
thought
i
would
break
it
to
that
was
rank
idiocy
generally
i
can
rise
to
the
occasion
with
more
success
what
do
i
care
about
his
old
uncle
cried
poor
peggy
i
never
even
saw
his
uncle
i
do
care
if
he
is
dead
something
has
happened
to
harry
oh
aunt
elizabeth
what
is
it
i
was
never
in
such
a
strait
in
my
life
there
was
that
poor
child
staring
at
the
letter
as
if
she
could
eat
it
and
then
at
me
i
dared
not
open
the
letter
before
her
we
were
out
on
the
porch
i
said
now
peggy
talbert
you
keep
quiet
and
do
make
a
little
fool
of
yourself
until
you
know
you
have
some
reason
for
it
i
am
going
up
to
my
own
room
and
you
sit
in
that
chair
and
when
i
have
read
this
letter
i
will
come
down
and
tell
you
about
i
know
he
is
dead
gasped
peggy
but
she
sat
down
dead
said
i
you
just
said
yourself
it
was
his
handwriting
do
have
a
little
sense
with
that
i
was
off
with
my
letter
and
i
locked
my
door
before
i
read
it
of
all
the
insane
ravings
i
put
it
on
my
hearth
and
struck
a
match
and
the
thing
went
up
in
flame
and
smoke
then
i
went
down
to
poor
little
peggy
and
patched
up
a
story
i
have
always
been
averse
to
lying
and
i
did
not
lie
then
although
i
must
admit
that
what
i
said
was
open
to
criticism
when
it
comes
to
exact
verity
i
told
peggy
that
harry
thought
that
he
had
done
something
to
make
her
angry
that
was
undeniably
true
and
did
not
dare
write
her
i
refused
utterly
to
tell
her
just
what
was
in
the
letter
but
i
did
succeed
in
quieting
her
and
making
her
think
that
harry
had
not
broken
faith
with
her
but
was
blaming
himself
for
some
unknown
and
imaginary
wrong
he
had
done
her
peggy
rushed
immediately
up
to
her
room
to
write
reassuring
pages
to
harry
and
her
aunt
had
the
horse
put
in
the
runabout
and
was
driven
over
to
whitman
where
nobody
knows
her
at
least
the
telegraph
operator
does
not
then
i
sent
a
telegram
to
harry
goward
to
the
effect
that
if
he
did
not
keep
his
promise
with
regard
to
writing
to
her
would
never
speak
to
him
again
that
was
about
to
send
but
he
must
keep
his
promise
with
regard
to
by
next
it
looked
like
the
most
melodramatic
sunday
personal
ever
invented
it
might
have
meant
burglary
or
murder
or
a
snare
for
innocence
but
i
sent
it
now
i
have
written
my
letter
went
in
the
same
mail
as
poor
peggy
but
what
will
be
the
outcome
of
it
all
i
can
not
say
sometimes
i
catch
peggy
looking
at
me
with
a
curious
awakened
expression
and
then
i
wonder
if
she
has
begun
to
suspect
i
can
not
tell
how
it
will
end
iii
the
grandmother
by
mary
heaton
vorse
the
position
of
an
older
woman
in
her
daughter
house
is
often
difficult
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
that
ada
is
a
mother
herself
she
might
be
even
a
and
yet
in
my
eyes
she
would
still
be
ada
my
little
girl
i
feel
the
need
of
guiding
her
and
protecting
her
just
as
much
this
minute
as
when
she
was
a
baby
in
the
nursery
only
now
the
task
is
much
more
difficult
that
is
why
i
say
that
the
position
of
women
placed
as
i
am
is
often
hard
harder
than
if
i
lived
somewhere
else
because
although
i
am
with
ada
i
can
no
longer
protect
her
from
anything
not
even
from
myself
my
illnesses
and
weaknesses
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
so
eagerly
do
i
follow
the
lights
and
shadows
of
my
daughter
life
as
if
i
were
living
a
second
existence
together
with
my
own
only
as
i
grow
older
i
am
less
fitted
physically
to
bear
things
even
though
i
take
them
philosophically
when
ada
and
the
rest
of
my
children
were
little
i
could
guard
against
the
menaces
to
their
happiness
i
could
keep
them
out
of
danger
if
their
little
friends
did
behave
i
sent
them
home
when
it
was
needed
i
did
hesitate
to
administer
a
good
wholesome
spanking
to
my
children
there
is
one
of
these
various
things
but
needs
doing
now
in
ada
house
i
ca
however
very
well
spank
cyrus
nor
can
i
send
elizabeth
home
all
i
can
do
is
to
sit
still
and
hold
my
tongue
though
i
do
know
i
sure
what
the
end
of
it
all
is
to
be
life
brings
new
lessons
at
every
turn
in
the
road
and
one
of
the
hardest
of
all
is
the
one
we
older
people
have
to
learn
to
sit
still
while
our
children
hurt
themselves
or
what
is
worse
to
sit
still
while
other
people
hurt
our
children
it
is
especially
hard
for
me
to
bear
when
life
is
made
difficult
for
my
ada
for
if
ever
any
one
deserved
happiness
my
daughter
does
i
try
to
do
justice
to
every
one
and
i
hope
i
am
not
unfair
when
i
say
that
the
best
of
men
and
cyrus
is
one
of
them
are
sometimes
blind
and
obstinate
of
all
my
children
ada
gave
me
the
least
trouble
and
was
always
the
most
loving
and
tender
and
considerate
indeed
if
ada
has
a
fault
it
is
being
too
considerate
i
could
if
she
only
would
let
me
help
her
a
great
deal
more
around
the
house
although
ada
is
a
very
good
housekeeper
i
am
constantly
seeing
little
things
that
need
doing
i
do
my
best
to
prevent
the
awful
waste
of
soap
that
goes
on
and
there
are
a
great
many
little
ways
ada
could
let
me
save
for
her
if
she
would
when
i
suggest
this
to
her
she
laughs
and
says
wait
till
we
need
to
save
as
badly
as
that
mother
which
does
seem
to
me
good
reasoning
at
all
waste
not
want
not
say
i
and
when
it
comes
to
throwing
out
perfectly
good
glass
jars
as
the
girls
would
do
if
i
did
see
to
it
they
saved
them
why
i
put
my
foot
down
if
ada
does
want
them
herself
to
put
things
up
in
why
some
poor
woman
will
i
do
believe
in
throwing
things
away
that
may
come
in
handy
sometime
when
i
kept
house
nobody
ever
went
lacking
strings
or
a
box
of
whatever
size
to
send
things
away
in
or
paper
in
which
to
do
it
up
and
i
can
remember
in
mother
day
there
was
never
a
time
she
had
pieces
put
by
for
a
handsome
quilt
machinery
has
put
a
stop
to
many
of
our
old
occupations
and
the
result
is
a
generation
of
nervous
women
who
have
a
single
thing
in
life
to
occupy
themselves
with
but
their
own
feelings
while
girls
like
peggy
who
are
active
and
useful
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
to
school
and
keep
on
going
to
school
if
one
wanted
to
dig
into
the
remote
cause
of
things
one
might
find
the
root
of
our
present
trouble
in
these
changed
conditions
for
sister
elizabeth
is
one
of
these
unoccupied
women
formerly
in
a
family
like
ours
there
would
have
been
so
much
to
do
that
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
and
whether
she
had
married
or
not
elizabeth
would
have
had
to
be
a
useful
woman
and
now
the
less
said
the
better
it
is
hard
i
say
to
see
the
causes
for
unhappiness
set
in
action
and
yet
do
nothing
or
if
one
speaks
to
speak
to
deaf
ears
oh
it
is
very
hard
to
do
this
and
this
has
been
the
portion
of
older
women
always
our
children
sometimes
wo
even
let
us
dry
their
tears
for
them
but
cry
by
themselves
as
i
know
ada
has
been
doing
lately
though
in
the
end
she
came
to
me
or
rather
i
went
to
her
for
after
all
i
am
living
in
the
same
world
with
the
rest
of
them
i
have
not
passed
over
to
the
other
side
yet
and
while
i
stay
i
am
not
going
to
be
treated
as
if
i
were
a
disembodied
spirit
i
have
eyes
of
my
own
and
ears
too
and
i
can
see
as
well
as
the
next
man
when
things
go
wrong
i
have
always
known
that
no
good
would
come
of
sending
peggy
to
a
coeducational
college
i
urged
ada
to
set
her
foot
down
for
ada
wish
to
send
peggy
there
naturally
enough
but
she
would
well
said
i
i
not
afraid
to
speak
my
mind
to
your
now
i
very
seldom
open
my
mouth
to
cyrus
or
to
any
one
else
in
this
house
for
it
is
more
than
ever
the
fashion
for
people
to
disregard
the
advice
of
others
and
the
older
i
get
the
more
i
find
it
wise
to
save
my
breath
to
cool
my
porridge
there
come
times
however
when
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
speak
mark
my
words
cyrus
i
said
you
be
sorry
you
sent
peggy
off
to
a
boys
school
girls
at
her
age
are
impressionable
and
if
they
under
their
mothers
roofs
where
they
can
be
protected
and
sheltered
why
then
send
them
to
a
seminary
where
they
will
see
as
few
young
men
as
cyrus
only
laughed
and
said
well
mother
you
can
say
told
you
so
if
anything
bad
comes
of
it
all
very
well
to
laugh
cyrus
i
answered
but
do
believe
in
putting
difficulties
into
life
that
are
there
already
and
what
sending
young
men
and
young
women
off
to
the
same
college
seems
to
me
when
peggy
came
home
engaged
after
her
last
year
everybody
was
surprised
i
sure
i
do
know
what
cyrus
expected
i
said
to
ada
you
go
out
in
the
rain
without
getting
wet
let
us
pray
that
this
young
man
will
turn
out
to
be
all
right
though
we
know
so
little
about
for
all
we
knew
was
what
peggy
told
us
and
you
know
the
kind
of
things
young
girls
have
to
tell
one
about
their
sweethearts
peggy
did
even
know
what
church
his
people
went
to
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
that
dear
child
setting
out
on
the
long
journey
of
marriage
in
such
a
fashion
i
looked
forward
with
fear
to
what
ada
might
have
to
go
through
if
it
did
turn
out
all
right
for
one
daughter
sorrows
are
own
what
she
suffers
one
must
suffer
too
it
is
hard
for
a
mother
to
see
a
happy
young
girl
turn
into
a
woman
before
her
eyes
even
if
a
woman
is
very
happy
marriage
brings
many
responsibilities
and
a
woman
who
has
known
the
terror
of
watching
beside
a
sick
child
can
never
be
quite
the
same
i
think
we
ourselves
grew
and
deepened
under
such
trials
and
we
would
wish
our
daughters
to
be
less
than
ourselves
but
oh
how
glad
i
should
be
to
have
peggy
spared
some
things
how
happy
i
should
be
to
know
that
she
was
to
have
for
her
lot
only
the
trials
we
all
must
have
i
do
not
want
to
see
my
ada
having
to
bear
the
unhappiness
of
seeing
peggy
unhappy
even
if
peggy
puts
up
a
brave
face
ada
will
know
she
will
know
just
as
i
have
known
things
in
my
own
children
lives
and
i
shall
know
too
this
young
man
has
it
in
his
hands
to
trouble
my
old
age
no
mother
and
daughter
can
live
together
as
ada
and
i
have
without
what
affects
one
of
us
affecting
the
other
when
her
babies
were
born
i
was
with
her
i
helped
her
bring
them
up
as
i
have
grown
older
though
she
comes
to
me
less
and
less
wishing
to
spare
me
i
seem
to
need
less
telling
for
i
know
myself
when
anything
ails
her
it
amazed
me
to
see
how
ada
took
peggy
engagement
and
when
young
henry
goward
came
to
visit
i
made
up
my
mind
that
he
should
not
go
away
again
without
our
finding
out
a
little
at
any
rate
of
what
his
surroundings
had
been
and
what
his
own
principles
were
as
we
grow
older
we
see
more
and
more
that
character
is
the
main
thing
in
life
and
i
would
rather
have
a
child
of
mine
marry
a
young
man
of
sound
principles
whom
she
respected
than
one
of
undisciplined
character
and
lax
ideas
whom
she
loved
when
i
said
things
like
this
to
ada
she
replied
i
afraid
you
prejudiced
against
that
poor
boy
because
he
and
peggy
happened
to
meet
at
i
answered
i
am
not
prejudiced
at
all
ada
but
i
feel
that
all
of
us
you
especially
should
keep
our
eyes
and
ears
open
wait
is
all
i
i
know
my
own
faults
for
i
have
always
believed
that
one
is
never
too
old
for
and
i
know
that
being
prejudiced
is
not
one
of
them
i
realize
too
keenly
that
as
women
advance
in
years
they
are
very
apt
to
get
set
in
their
ways
unless
they
take
care
and
i
am
naturally
too
to
judge
a
man
before
i
have
seen
him
maria
and
alice
were
prejudiced
if
you
like
maria
indeed
had
so
much
to
say
to
ada
that
i
interfered
though
it
is
contrary
to
my
custom
i
should
think
maria
i
said
that
however
old
you
are
you
would
realize
that
your
father
and
mother
are
even
better
able
to
judge
than
you
as
to
their
children
i
can
not
imagine
where
maria
gets
her
dominant
disposition
it
is
very
unlike
the
women
of
our
family
when
he
came
however
goward
manners
and
appearance
impressed
me
favorably
neither
ada
nor
cyrus
as
far
as
i
could
see
tried
in
the
least
to
draw
him
out
i
sat
quiet
for
a
while
but
at
last
for
sake
i
felt
i
would
do
what
i
could
to
find
out
his
views
on
important
things
i
was
considerably
relieved
to
hear
that
his
mother
was
a
van
horn
a
very
good
troy
family
and
distant
connection
of
mother
when
i
asked
him
what
he
was
my
people
are
episcopalians
he
replied
i
suppose
that
means
you
are
something
else
i
asked
him
i
afraid
it
means
i
nothing
else
he
answered
and
while
i
was
glad
he
was
so
honest
i
could
help
feeling
anxious
at
having
peggy
engaged
to
a
man
so
unformed
in
his
beliefs
i
do
not
care
so
much
what
people
believe
for
i
am
not
bigoted
as
that
they
should
believe
something
and
that
with
their
whole
hearts
there
are
a
great
many
young
men
like
henry
goward
who
have
no
fixed
beliefs
and
no
established
principles
beyond
a
vague
desire
to
be
what
they
call
decent
one
needs
more
than
that
in
this
world
however
i
found
the
boy
likable
and
everything
went
smoothly
for
a
time
when
all
at
once
i
felt
something
had
gone
wrong
what
i
know
goward
received
a
telegram
and
left
suddenly
ada
i
could
see
was
anxious
peggy
tearful
and
as
if
this
was
enough
temple
our
new
neighbor
who
had
seemed
a
sensible
body
to
me
had
some
sort
of
a
with
aunt
elizabeth
who
pretended
that
temple
was
jealous
of
her
after
temple
had
gone
home
elizabeth
talbert
went
around
pleased
as
punch
and
swore
us
all
to
solemn
secrecy
never
to
tell
any
one
about
mrs
temple
absurd
you
need
worry
about
me
aunt
elizabeth
i
said
i
not
likely
to
go
around
proclaiming
that
another
woman
has
made
a
fool
of
elizabeth
talbert
is
one
of
those
women
who
live
on
a
false
basis
she
is
a
case
of
arrested
development
she
enjoys
the
same
amusements
that
she
did
fifteen
years
ago
she
is
like
a
young
fruit
that
has
been
put
up
in
a
preserving
fluid
and
gives
the
illusion
of
youth
the
preserving
fluid
in
her
case
is
the
disappointment
she
suffered
as
a
girl
i
like
useful
women
women
who
whether
married
or
unmarried
bring
things
to
pass
in
this
world
and
elizabeth
does
not
still
i
ca
help
feeling
sorry
for
her
poor
thing
in
the
end
our
own
shortcomings
and
vanities
hurt
us
more
than
they
hurt
any
one
else
i
heartily
wish
she
would
get
married
i
have
known
women
older
than
elizabeth
and
to
find
husbands
both
for
her
own
sake
and
for
ada
for
her
comings
and
goings
complicate
life
for
my
daughter
she
diffuses
around
her
an
atmosphere
of
criticism
i
do
not
think
she
ever
returns
from
a
visit
to
the
city
without
wishing
that
we
should
have
dinner
at
night
and
alice
is
beginning
to
prick
up
her
ears
and
listen
to
her
she
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
over
her
dress
and
if
she
has
grown
no
older
neither
have
her
clothes
not
a
particle
she
dresses
in
gowns
suitable
for
peggy
but
which
maria
who
is
years
younger
than
her
aunt
would
not
think
of
wearing
elizabeth
is
the
kind
of
woman
who
is
a
changed
being
at
the
approach
of
a
man
she
is
even
different
when
cyrus
or
billy
is
around
she
brightens
up
and
exerts
herself
to
please
them
but
when
she
is
alone
with
ada
and
me
she
is
frankly
bored
and
looks
out
of
the
window
in
a
sad
manner
the
presence
of
men
has
a
most
rejuvenating
effect
on
aunt
elizabeth
although
she
pretends
she
has
never
been
interested
in
any
man
since
her
disappointment
years
ago
when
she
got
back
and
found
harry
goward
here
instead
of
relapsing
into
her
ways
as
she
generally
does
she
kept
on
her
interested
air
i
have
always
thought
that
houses
have
their
atmosphere
like
people
and
this
house
lately
has
seemed
bewitched
after
goward
left
although
every
one
tried
to
pretend
things
were
as
they
should
be
the
situation
grew
more
and
more
uncomfortable
i
felt
it
though
no
one
told
me
a
thing
i
fancy
that
most
older
people
have
the
same
experience
often
that
i
have
had
lately
all
at
once
you
are
aware
something
is
wrong
you
ca
tell
why
you
feel
this
you
only
know
that
you
are
living
in
the
cold
shadow
of
some
invisible
unhappiness
you
see
no
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
you
love
but
tears
have
been
shed
just
the
same
why
you
do
know
and
no
one
thinks
of
telling
you
it
is
like
seeing
life
from
so
far
off
that
you
can
not
make
out
what
has
happened
i
have
sometimes
leaned
out
of
a
window
and
have
seen
down
the
street
a
crowd
of
gesticulating
people
but
i
was
too
far
off
to
know
whether
some
one
was
hurt
or
whether
it
was
only
people
gathered
around
a
man
selling
something
when
i
see
such
things
my
heart
beats
for
i
am
always
afraid
it
is
an
accident
and
so
with
the
things
i
do
know
in
my
own
household
i
always
fancy
them
worse
than
they
are
there
are
so
many
things
one
can
imagine
when
one
does
know
and
now
i
fancied
everything
such
things
i
think
tell
on
older
people
more
than
on
younger
ones
and
at
last
i
went
to
my
room
and
kept
there
most
of
the
time
reading
william
james
varieties
of
religious
experience
it
is
an
excellent
work
in
many
ways
i
am
told
it
is
given
in
sanitariums
for
nervous
people
to
read
for
the
purpose
of
getting
their
minds
off
themselves
i
found
it
useful
to
get
my
mind
off
others
for
of
late
i
have
gotten
to
an
almost
morbid
alertness
and
i
know
by
the
very
way
peggy
ran
up
the
stairs
that
something
ailed
her
even
before
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
which
showed
me
that
she
was
going
straight
to
her
room
to
cry
this
sort
of
thing
had
happened
too
often
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
not
live
in
this
moral
fog
another
moment
so
i
went
to
ada
ada
i
said
i
am
your
mother
and
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
a
question
i
want
to
know
this
what
has
that
young
man
been
doing
i
suppose
you
mean
harry
ada
answered
he
has
been
doing
anything
peggy
a
little
upset
because
he
is
a
good
correspondent
you
know
how
girls
feel
do
tell
me
ada
said
i
i
know
better
there
more
in
it
than
that
peggy
a
sensible
girl
there
something
wrong
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
it
younger
people
do
realize
how
bad
it
can
be
to
be
left
to
worry
alone
in
the
dark
ada
sat
down
with
a
discouraged
air
such
as
i
have
seldom
seen
her
with
i
went
over
to
her
and
took
her
hand
in
mine
tell
mother
what
worrying
you
dear
i
said
gently
why
it
all
so
absurd
ada
answered
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
aunt
elizabeth
came
to
me
full
of
mystery
soon
after
she
came
back
and
told
me
that
harry
goward
had
become
infatuated
with
her
when
she
was
off
on
one
of
her
visits
i
could
help
exclaiming
well
of
all
things
that
not
the
queerest
part
ada
went
on
she
told
me
as
confidently
as
could
be
that
he
is
still
in
love
with
ada
said
i
elizabeth
talbert
must
be
daft
does
she
think
that
all
the
men
in
the
world
are
in
love
with
her
at
her
age
first
temple
making
such
a
rumpus
and
now
this
at
first
i
thought
just
as
you
do
ada
said
helplessly
of
course
there
ca
be
anything
in
it
and
yet
i
sure
i
do
understand
the
situation
at
all
you
know
harry
left
quite
unexpectedly
soon
after
elizabeth
came
he
did
write
for
a
week
and
then
to
her
and
only
had
one
short
note
from
him
i
can
see
through
a
hole
in
a
millstone
as
well
as
any
one
and
a
light
dawned
on
me
you
can
depend
upon
it
ada
i
said
aunt
elizabeth
has
been
making
trouble
i
do
know
what
she
been
up
to
but
she
been
up
to
something
i
wondered
why
she
had
been
having
such
a
contented
look
lately
and
now
i
oh
mother
i
ca
believe
that
ada
protested
i
thought
elizabeth
was
a
little
vain
and
silly
and
though
everything
is
so
incomprehensible
i
do
believe
for
a
moment
that
aunt
elizabeth
would
do
anything
to
hurt
my
ada
is
a
truly
good
woman
so
good
that
it
is
almost
impossible
for
her
to
believe
ill
of
any
one
and
she
was
profoundly
shocked
at
what
i
suggested
i
do
think
in
the
beginning
elizabeth
intended
to
hurt
peggy
i
answered
her
gently
but
when
you
lived
as
long
in
the
world
as
i
have
you
realize
to
what
lengths
a
woman
will
go
to
show
the
world
she
still
young
just
look
at
it
for
yourself
everything
was
going
smoothly
until
elizabeth
came
now
it
not
elizabeth
has
told
you
she
had
with
harry
goward
i
do
see
ada
how
you
can
be
so
blind
as
not
to
be
willing
to
look
the
truth
in
the
face
if
not
elizabeth
fault
whose
is
it
i
do
suppose
you
believe
henry
goward
dying
for
love
of
aunt
elizabeth
when
he
can
look
at
peggy
oh
i
like
to
hear
his
side
of
the
story
for
you
may
be
sure
that
there
is
one
mother
said
ada
if
i
believed
elizabeth
had
done
anything
to
mar
that
child
happiness
she
stopped
for
fear
i
suppose
of
what
she
might
be
led
to
say
we
must
judge
before
we
know
she
finished
but
i
knew
by
the
look
on
her
face
that
if
aunt
elizabeth
has
made
trouble
ada
will
never
forgive
her
what
does
cyrus
say
to
all
this
i
asked
by
way
of
diversion
oh
i
have
told
cyrus
anything
about
it
i
did
intend
to
tell
any
one
about
aunt
elizabeth
part
in
it
i
think
cyrus
is
a
little
uneasy
himself
but
he
been
so
busy
lately
well
i
said
think
cyrus
ought
to
be
told
and
you
the
one
to
do
it
do
let
judge
to
be
sure
before
we
know
everything
but
i
think
cyrus
ought
to
know
the
mischief
his
sister
is
making
elizabeth
simply
makes
a
convenience
of
this
house
it
her
basis
of
departure
to
pack
her
trunk
from
that
all
your
home
means
to
her
she
never
lifted
a
finger
to
be
useful
beyond
rearranging
the
furniture
in
a
different
way
from
what
you
arranged
it
she
acts
exactly
as
if
she
were
a
young
lady
boarder
she
nothing
whatever
to
do
in
this
world
except
make
trouble
for
others
i
think
cyrus
should
know
and
then
if
he
prefers
his
sister
convenience
to
his
wife
happiness
well
and
good
it
not
often
i
speak
out
but
now
and
then
things
happen
which
i
ca
very
well
keep
silent
about
it
did
me
good
to
ease
my
mind
about
elizabeth
talbert
for
once
ada
only
said
elizabeth
and
i
have
always
been
such
good
friends
and
she
so
fond
of
ada
does
realize
that
with
some
women
vanity
is
stronger
than
loyalty
she
kissed
me
it
done
me
good
to
talk
to
you
mother
she
said
because
now
it
does
seem
when
i
put
it
outside
myself
that
there
very
much
of
anything
to
worry
ada
has
always
been
like
that
she
seems
to
get
rid
of
her
troubles
just
by
telling
them
now
she
had
passed
her
riddle
on
to
me
and
i
could
not
keep
peggy
and
her
affairs
from
my
mind
i
tried
to
tell
myself
that
it
would
be
better
for
every
one
to
find
out
now
than
later
if
henry
goward
was
not
worthy
to
be
peggy
husband
but
oh
for
all
their
sakes
how
i
hoped
this
cloud
whatever
it
was
would
blow
over
i
have
a
very
good
constitution
and
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
it
but
when
several
more
days
passed
without
peggy
hearing
from
henry
again
i
gave
way
but
i
tried
to
keep
up
on
ada
account
i
began
to
see
how
much
this
young
man
honor
and
faithfulness
meant
to
peggy
and
i
took
long
excursions
back
into
the
past
to
remember
how
i
felt
at
her
age
was
the
difficult
time
for
all
three
of
us
before
the
postman
came
peggy
would
brighten
up
not
that
she
was
drooping
at
any
time
only
i
knew
how
tensely
she
waited
because
ada
and
i
waited
with
her
when
the
man
came
and
again
no
letters
peggy
held
up
her
head
bravely
as
could
be
but
i
could
see
all
the
same
how
the
light
had
gone
out
the
worst
of
it
was
everybody
knew
about
it
it
would
have
been
twice
as
easy
for
the
child
if
she
could
have
borne
it
alone
but
elizabeth
talbert
watched
the
mail
like
a
cat
and
even
manoeuvred
to
try
and
get
the
letters
before
peggy
while
alice
went
around
with
her
nose
in
the
air
and
i
heard
maria
saying
to
ada
what
all
this
about
harry
goward
not
writing
to
escape
it
all
i
took
to
my
room
coming
down
only
for
meals
i
could
eat
a
thing
and
cyrus
noticed
it
it
is
queer
how
observant
men
are
about
some
things
and
how
unobservant
about
others
he
tell
me
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
in
the
afternoon
denbigh
came
to
see
me
that
the
way
they
do
i
liable
to
have
the
doctor
sent
in
to
look
me
over
any
time
whether
i
want
him
or
not
denbigh
is
an
excellent
friend
and
a
good
doctor
but
at
my
time
of
life
i
should
be
lacking
in
intelligence
if
i
did
understand
my
constitution
better
than
any
doctor
can
they
seem
to
think
that
there
more
virtue
in
a
pill
or
a
powder
because
a
doctor
gives
it
to
one
than
because
tells
one
to
take
it
that
afternoon
i
did
need
him
any
more
than
a
squirrel
needs
a
pocket
and
i
told
him
so
he
laughed
and
then
grew
serious
you
not
looking
as
well
as
you
did
evarts
he
said
and
talbert
told
me
that
you
had
all
the
preliminary
symptoms
of
one
of
your
attacks
and
wanted
me
to
it
in
the
bud
he
dr
denbigh
said
i
if
the
matter
with
me
could
be
cured
by
the
things
you
know
there
are
other
people
in
this
house
who
need
your
attention
more
than
i
wanted
to
add
that
if
cyrus
would
always
be
as
as
he
has
been
about
me
there
would
be
anything
the
matter
but
i
held
my
tongue
i
see
you
worried
about
something
the
doctor
said
very
kindly
mental
anxiety
pulls
you
down
quicker
than
then
as
he
sat
chatting
with
me
so
kind
and
good
there
something
about
denbigh
that
makes
me
think
of
my
own
father
although
he
is
young
enough
to
be
my
son
i
told
him
the
whole
thing
all
except
aunt
elizabeth
share
in
it
i
merely
told
him
that
henry
goward
had
written
to
her
and
not
to
peggy
i
felt
very
much
better
he
took
what
i
told
him
seriously
and
yet
not
in
the
tragic
way
we
did
he
has
a
way
of
listening
that
is
very
comforting
it
seems
absurd
i
know
for
an
old
woman
like
me
to
get
upset
just
because
her
grandchild
does
not
get
letters
from
her
sweetheart
i
told
him
but
you
see
doctor
no
one
suffers
alone
in
a
family
like
ours
an
event
like
this
is
like
a
wave
that
disturbs
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
every
one
of
us
feels
anything
that
happens
each
in
his
separate
way
why
i
ca
be
sick
without
its
causing
inconvenience
to
and
it
is
true
people
in
this
world
are
bound
up
together
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
and
i
wondered
if
henry
goward
mother
was
unhappy
too
and
was
wondering
what
it
was
peggy
had
done
to
her
boy
for
she
of
course
will
think
whatever
happens
is
peggy
fault
the
engagement
of
these
two
young
people
has
been
like
a
stone
thrown
into
a
pond
and
it
takes
only
a
very
little
pebble
to
ruffle
the
water
farther
than
one
would
believe
it
possible
after
the
doctor
left
ada
came
to
sit
with
me
we
were
sewing
quietly
when
i
heard
voices
in
the
hall
i
heard
peggy
say
i
want
you
to
tell
then
billy
growled
i
do
see
what
you
making
such
a
kick
for
i
would
have
told
you
if
i
known
you
be
so
and
i
heard
peggy
say
again
i
want
you
to
tell
her
tone
was
perfectly
even
but
it
sounded
like
cyrus
when
he
is
angry
they
both
came
in
peggy
was
flushed
and
her
lips
were
pressed
firmly
together
she
looked
older
than
i
have
ever
seen
her
what
the
matter
ada
asked
them
tell
her
peggy
commanded
billy
did
know
what
it
all
was
about
why
i
just
said
i
wondered
what
aunt
elizabeth
was
telegraphing
harry
goward
about
and
now
she
drags
me
in
here
and
makes
a
fuss
he
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
he
was
over
at
whitman
playing
around
the
he
had
driven
over
on
the
and
when
aunt
elizabeth
drove
up
he
hid
because
he
did
want
her
to
see
him
then
he
heard
the
operator
read
the
address
aloud
peggy
explained
evenly
is
this
so
ada
asked
sure
billy
answered
disgustedly
and
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
now
said
peggy
i
want
to
know
why
harry
wrote
to
aunt
elizabeth
and
why
she
telegraphed
him
over
there
where
no
one
could
see
her
she
stood
up
very
straight
i
think
i
ought
to
know
she
said
gently
yes
dear
ada
answered
i
think
you
i
shall
be
sorry
for
elizabeth
talbert
if
she
has
been
making
mischief
iv
the
by
mary
stewart
cutting
i
have
never
identified
myself
with
my
husband
family
and
charles
edward
who
is
the
best
sort
ever
does
expect
me
to
of
course
i
want
to
be
decent
to
them
though
i
know
they
talk
about
me
but
you
ca
make
oil
and
water
mix
and
i
do
see
the
use
of
pretending
that
you
can
i
know
they
never
can
understand
how
charles
edward
married
me
and
they
never
can
get
used
to
my
being
such
a
different
type
from
theirs
the
talberts
are
all
and
rosy
and
dark
thin
and
pale
and
grandmother
evarts
always
thinks
i
ca
be
well
and
wants
me
to
take
the
medicine
she
takes
but
really
i
see
very
little
of
the
family
except
alice
and
billy
who
do
count
billy
comes
in
at
any
time
he
feels
like
it
to
get
a
book
and
something
to
eat
though
the
others
do
know
it
and
alice
has
fits
of
stopping
in
every
afternoon
on
her
way
from
school
and
then
perhaps
does
come
near
me
for
weeks
alice
is
terribly
discontented
at
home
and
i
think
it
a
very
good
thing
that
she
is
anything
is
better
than
sinking
to
that
dreadful
dead
level
she
does
quite
know
whether
to
take
up
the
artistic
life
or
be
a
society
queen
and
she
feels
that
nobody
understands
her
at
home
it
makes
her
nearly
wild
when
aunt
elizabeth
comes
back
from
one
of
her
grand
visits
and
acts
as
if
she
was
anything
she
came
over
right
after
the
row
of
course
and
told
me
all
about
it
she
had
on
her
new
white
china
silk
and
her
hat
with
the
feathers
she
said
she
was
so
excited
about
everything
that
she
could
stop
to
think
about
what
she
put
on
she
looked
terribly
dressed
up
but
she
had
come
all
through
the
village
with
her
waist
unfastened
in
the
middle
of
the
back
she
said
she
could
reach
the
hooks
aunt
elizabeth
had
gone
away
that
morning
for
overnight
so
nobody
could
get
at
her
to
find
out
about
her
actions
with
goward
and
the
telegram
she
had
sent
to
him
until
the
next
day
and
every
one
was
nearly
crazy
they
talked
about
it
for
two
hours
before
maria
went
home
then
peggy
had
locked
herself
in
her
room
and
her
mother
had
gone
out
and
her
grandmother
was
sitting
now
on
the
piazza
rocking
and
sighing
with
her
eyes
shut
alice
said
each
person
had
got
dreadfully
worked
up
not
only
about
aunt
elizabeth
but
about
all
the
ways
every
other
member
of
the
family
had
hurt
that
person
at
some
time
maria
said
that
peggy
never
would
take
her
advice
and
peggy
returned
that
maria
had
hurt
her
more
than
any
one
by
her
attitude
toward
harry
goward
that
she
was
so
suspicious
of
him
that
it
had
made
him
act
unnaturally
from
the
first
that
nothing
had
hurt
her
so
much
since
the
time
maria
took
away
peggy
doll
on
purpose
when
she
was
a
little
girl
the
doll
she
used
to
sleep
with
and
burned
it
it
was
something
she
had
never
got
over
then
her
mother
who
had
been
talking
very
much
said
that
peggy
did
realize
the
depth
of
maria
affection
for
her
and
what
a
good
sister
she
had
been
and
how
she
had
taken
care
of
peggy
the
winter
that
peggy
was
ill
and
then
she
could
help
saying
that
bad
as
was
this
affair
about
harry
goward
it
was
like
the
anxiety
one
felt
about
a
sick
child
there
were
times
when
she
felt
that
she
could
bear
anything
if
charles
edward
health
were
only
properly
looked
after
of
course
lorraine
was
young
and
inexperienced
but
if
she
would
only
use
her
influence
with
him
alice
broke
off
suddenly
and
said
she
had
to
go
it
was
just
as
denbigh
little
auto
was
coming
down
the
street
she
dashed
out
of
the
door
and
bowed
to
him
from
the
crossing
quite
like
a
young
lady
for
all
her
short
skirts
she
really
did
look
fetching
denbigh
smiled
at
her
but
not
the
way
he
used
to
smile
at
peggy
i
really
thought
he
cared
for
peggy
once
though
he
so
much
older
that
nobody
else
seemed
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
of
course
after
alice
went
i
just
sat
there
in
the
chair
all
humped
up
thinking
of
her
last
words
the
family
are
always
harping
on
lorraine
if
they
wanted
their
dear
charles
edward
made
different
from
the
way
he
is
why
on
earth
did
they
do
it
themselves
when
they
had
the
chance
what
i
want
to
know
i
know
they
mean
to
be
nice
to
me
but
they
take
it
for
granted
that
every
habit
charles
edward
has
or
has
and
everything
he
does
or
does
is
because
i
did
do
something
that
i
ought
to
have
done
or
condoned
something
that
i
ought
not
they
seem
to
think
that
a
man
is
made
of
soft
kindergarten
clay
and
all
a
wife
has
to
do
is
to
sit
down
and
mould
him
as
she
pleases
well
some
men
may
be
like
that
but
peter
is
the
family
never
really
have
forgiven
me
for
calling
their
darling
charles
edward
peter
i
perfectly
loathe
that
name
and
i
do
care
how
many
grandfathers
it
descended
from
i
sorry
of
course
if
it
hurts
their
feelings
but
as
long
as
do
object
to
their
calling
him
what
they
like
i
do
see
why
they
mind
and
as
for
my
managing
peter
they
know
perfectly
well
that
though
he
a
darling
he
just
mulishly
obstinate
he
had
his
own
way
ever
since
he
was
born
the
whole
family
simply
adore
him
his
mother
has
always
waited
on
him
hand
and
foot
though
she
sensible
enough
with
the
other
children
if
he
looks
sulky
she
is
perfectly
miserable
i
am
really
very
fond
of
my
that
is
i
am
fond
of
her
in
spots
there
are
times
when
she
understands
how
i
feel
about
peter
better
than
any
one
else
like
that
dreadful
spring
when
he
had
pneumonia
and
i
was
nearly
wild
i
know
she
is
dreadfully
unselfish
and
kind
but
she
will
think
they
all
do
that
they
know
what
peter
needs
better
than
i
do
and
whenever
they
see
me
alone
it
to
hint
that
i
ought
to
keep
him
from
smoking
too
much
and
being
extravagant
and
that
i
should
make
him
wear
his
overcoat
and
go
to
bed
early
and
take
medicine
when
he
has
a
cold
and
through
everything
else
they
hark
back
to
that
everlasting
if
you
only
exert
your
influence
lorraine
dear
to
make
charles
edward
take
more
interest
in
the
business
his
father
thinks
so
much
of
if
i
were
to
tell
them
that
charles
edward
perfectly
detests
the
business
and
will
never
be
interested
in
it
and
never
make
anything
out
of
it
they
all
go
straight
off
the
handle
yet
they
all
know
it
just
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
trouble
you
simply
ca
tell
them
the
truth
about
anything
they
do
want
to
hear
it
i
never
talk
at
all
any
more
when
i
go
over
to
the
big
house
for
i
ca
seem
to
without
horrifying
somebody
i
thought
i
should
die
when
i
first
came
here
it
was
so
different
from
the
way
it
is
at
home
where
you
can
say
or
do
anything
you
please
without
caring
what
anybody
thinks
dad
has
always
believed
in
not
restricting
individuality
and
that
girls
have
just
as
much
right
to
live
their
own
lives
as
boys
which
is
a
fortunate
thing
for
counting
momsey
there
are
four
of
us
we
never
had
any
system
about
anything
at
home
thank
goodness
we
just
had
atmosphere
dad
was
an
artist
you
know
and
he
does
paint
such
lovely
pictures
but
he
gave
it
up
as
a
profession
when
we
were
little
and
went
into
business
because
he
said
he
could
let
his
family
starve
and
we
all
think
it
was
so
perfectly
noble
of
him
i
give
up
being
an
artist
for
anybody
no
matter
who
starved
and
peter
feels
that
way
too
of
course
we
both
realize
that
we
not
living
here
in
this
hole
we
simply
existing
and
nothing
matters
very
much
until
we
get
out
of
it
in
six
months
when
charles
edward
is
there
a
little
money
coming
to
him
three
thousand
dollars
and
then
we
going
to
paris
to
live
our
own
lives
but
nobody
knows
anything
about
that
one
day
i
said
something
without
thinking
to
my
about
that
money
i
forgotten
what
it
was
but
she
looked
so
horrified
and
actually
gasped
you
would
think
of
charles
edward
using
his
principal
lorraine
and
i
said
why
not
it
his
own
well
i
just
made
up
my
mind
afterward
that
i
never
open
my
mouth
again
while
i
live
here
about
anything
i
was
interested
in
even
about
peter
his
father
might
have
let
him
go
to
paris
that
year
before
we
met
when
he
was
in
new
york
at
the
art
league
just
as
well
as
not
but
the
family
all
consulted
about
it
peter
says
and
concluded
it
that
is
the
blight
that
is
always
put
on
everything
we
want
to
do
it
is
necessary
oh
how
alice
hates
that
word
she
says
she
supposes
it
never
necessary
to
be
happy
well
peter
heard
that
when
the
paris
scheme
came
up
he
written
home
that
he
could
work
without
the
art
atmosphere
grandmother
evarts
said
why
i
sure
he
has
the
metropolitan
museum
to
go
to
and
wanamaker
too
has
he
been
to
wanamaker
i
thought
i
should
throw
a
fit
when
peter
told
me
that
i
know
of
course
that
the
family
pity
peter
for
living
in
a
house
that
all
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
for
not
having
everything
the
way
he
has
been
used
to
having
it
and
i
know
they
think
i
keep
him
from
going
to
see
them
all
at
home
when
the
truth
is
although
as
usual
i
say
it
sometimes
i
absolutely
have
to
hound
him
to
go
there
though
of
course
he
awfully
fond
of
them
all
and
his
mother
especially
but
he
gets
dreadfully
lazy
and
says
they
his
own
people
anyway
and
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
about
it
it
their
own
fault
because
always
spoiled
him
and
if
they
only
knew
how
he
hates
just
that
way
of
living
he
been
always
used
to
with
its
little
petty
rules
and
regulations
and
the
stupid
family
meals
where
everybody
is
expected
to
be
on
time
to
the
minute
my
pulls
out
his
chair
at
the
exactly
as
the
clock
is
striking
one
and
if
any
member
of
the
family
is
a
fraction
late
all
the
rest
are
solemn
and
strained
and
nervous
until
the
culprit
appears
peter
says
the
way
he
used
to
suffer
he
was
never
on
time
the
menu
for
each
day
of
the
week
is
as
fixed
as
fate
no
matter
what
the
season
of
the
year
hot
roast
beef
sunday
cold
roast
beef
monday
tuesday
roast
mutton
wednesday
mutton
thursday
corned
beef
friday
and
again
on
saturday
my
never
eats
fish
or
poultry
so
they
only
have
either
if
there
is
state
company
there
one
sacred
apple
pudding
that
been
made
every
wednesday
for
nineteen
years
and
if
you
can
imagine
anything
more
positively
dreadful
than
that
ca
every
time
as
soon
as
we
sit
down
to
the
table
grandmother
evarts
always
begins
officially
well
charles
edward
my
dear
boy
we
do
have
you
here
very
often
nowadays
i
said
to
your
mother
yesterday
that
it
was
two
whole
weeks
since
you
had
been
to
see
her
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
lately
and
when
he
says
as
he
always
does
nothing
grandmother
i
know
she
disappointed
and
then
she
starts
in
and
tells
what
she
has
been
doing
and
maria
maria
always
manages
to
be
there
when
we
are
maria
tells
what
she
has
been
doing
with
little
side
digs
at
me
because
i
have
been
pickling
or
preserving
or
cleaning
once
when
i
first
went
there
maria
asked
me
at
dinner
what
days
i
had
for
cleaning
and
i
said
as
innocently
as
possible
that
i
had
any
that
i
perfectly
loathed
cleaning
and
that
we
never
cleaned
at
home
of
course
it
true
but
we
never
talk
about
it
anyway
peter
said
he
nearly
shrieked
with
joy
to
hear
me
come
out
like
that
it
was
almost
as
bad
as
the
time
i
wore
that
sweet
little
yellow
empire
gown
it
a
dear
and
lyman
wilde
simply
raved
over
it
when
he
painted
me
in
it
not
that
he
can
really
paint
but
he
has
a
touch
with
everything
he
does
i
noticed
that
everybody
seemed
solemn
and
queer
but
i
never
dreamed
that
i
was
the
cause
until
my
came
to
me
afterward
blushing
and
told
me
that
talbert
never
allowed
any
of
the
family
to
wear
mother
hubbards
around
the
house
mother
hubbards
i
could
have
moaned
well
when
i
go
around
there
now
i
never
care
what
i
have
on
and
i
never
pretend
to
talk
at
meals
i
just
sit
and
try
and
make
my
mind
a
blank
until
it
over
you
have
to
make
your
mind
a
blank
if
you
do
want
to
be
driven
raving
crazy
by
that
it
has
a
hideous
sideboard
an
of
pale
bloated
fruit
on
one
side
and
pale
bloated
fish
on
the
other
and
a
strip
of
marbled
below
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
could
hardly
live
until
my
rises
from
his
chair
and
kisses
his
wife
before
going
off
to
the
factory
she
always
blushes
so
prettily
when
he
kisses
her
as
if
it
were
for
the
first
time
then
everybody
looks
pained
when
peter
and
i
just
nod
at
each
other
as
he
goes
out
i
can
not
be
affectionate
to
him
before
them
and
then
thank
heaven
the
rest
of
us
escape
from
the
how
peggy
who
has
been
away
from
home
and
seen
and
done
things
can
stand
it
there
now
as
it
is
is
a
continual
wonder
to
me
peggy
is
a
dear
little
thing
peter
has
always
been
awfully
fond
of
her
but
she
does
seem
to
have
an
idea
in
her
head
beyond
her
clothes
and
harry
goward
though
she
have
to
have
something
more
to
her
if
going
to
keep
him
the
moment
i
saw
that
boy
of
course
i
knew
that
he
had
the
artistic
temperament
i
seen
so
much
of
it
he
the
kind
that
always
awfully
gloomy
until
eleven
in
the
morning
and
has
to
make
love
intensely
to
somebody
every
evening
what
it
must
have
been
to
that
boy
after
indulging
in
a
romantic
dream
with
poor
little
earnest
downright
peggy
to
wake
up
and
find
the
engagement
taken
seriously
not
only
by
her
but
by
all
her
relatives
find
himself
being
welcomed
into
the
family
introduced
to
them
all
as
a
future
member
what
it
must
have
been
to
him
i
ca
imagine
peggy
has
no
more
temperament
than
a
cow
the
combination
of
maria
and
tom
and
grandmother
evarts
and
billy
with
his
face
washed
clean
and
alice
with
three
enormous
bows
on
her
hair
all
waiting
to
welcome
him
standing
by
the
pictorial
lamp
on
the
brown
worsted
mat
on
the
made
me
fairly
howl
when
i
sat
at
home
and
thought
of
it
and
that
was
before
i
seen
harry
the
family
were
of
course
quite
hurt
that
peter
and
i
assist
at
the
celebration
i
can
not
see
why
people
will
want
you
to
do
things
when
they
know
you
do
care
to
the
next
evening
however
we
had
to
go
when
peggy
herself
came
around
and
asked
us
of
course
goward
was
with
peggy
most
of
the
time
they
certainly
looked
charming
together
but
rather
conscious
and
stiff
every
member
of
the
family
was
watching
his
every
motion
oh
i
been
there
i
know
what
it
is
some
of
the
neighbors
were
there
too
peter
hardly
ever
plays
on
the
big
but
that
night
he
was
so
bored
he
had
to
the
family
always
think
they
very
musical
you
can
know
the
style
when
i
tell
you
that
after
peter
has
been
rambling
through
bits
from
schumann
and
richard
strauss
they
always
ask
him
if
he
wo
play
well
after
peggy
had
gone
into
the
other
room
with
her
mother
to
do
the
polite
to
temple
goward
gravitated
over
to
where
i
sat
in
the
big
behind
the
piano
he
had
that
air
that
i
know
so
well
then
we
got
to
talking
and
listening
in
between
whiles
he
knows
lots
of
girls
in
the
art
league
till
peter
began
playing
that
im
herbst
from
the
franz
songs
and
then
he
said
you
going
to
be
my
sister
are
you
wo
you
let
me
hold
your
hand
while
your
husband
playing
that
it
makes
me
feel
so
lonely
i
answered
promptly
certainly
hold
both
hands
if
you
like
and
we
laughed
and
peter
turned
around
for
a
moment
and
smiled
too
oh
it
was
nice
to
meet
somebody
of
one
own
kind
you
get
so
sick
of
having
everything
taken
seriously
that
night
after
we
left
the
house
harry
caught
up
with
us
at
the
corner
on
his
way
to
the
hotel
and
went
home
with
us
and
we
all
talked
until
three
in
the
morning
we
simply
ate
all
over
the
house
goodness
how
hungry
we
were
at
peter
home
it
an
thing
to
eat
anything
after
six
almost
a
crime
unless
it
a
wedding
or
state
reception
we
began
now
with
coffee
in
the
and
jam
and
cheese
and
ended
by
gradual
stages
at
hot
lobster
in
the
in
the
studio
the
darky
was
out
all
night
as
usual
then
harry
and
peter
concluded
that
it
was
too
late
to
go
to
bed
at
all
it
was
really
daylight
so
they
took
and
went
down
to
the
river
and
had
a
swim
and
harry
slipped
back
to
the
house
at
six
he
said
we
repeat
it
all
the
next
night
but
of
course
we
did
he
the
kind
that
as
soon
as
he
promised
to
do
a
thing
feels
at
once
that
he
does
really
want
to
do
it
the
next
day
peter
aunt
elizabeth
came
on
the
scene
and
of
course
we
stayed
away
as
much
as
we
could
she
loves
peter
they
all
do
but
she
has
any
use
for
me
and
shows
it
she
thinks
i
perfectly
dumb
and
stupid
i
simply
do
exist
and
i
never
tried
to
undeceive
her
it
too
much
trouble
she
always
wants
to
tell
people
how
to
do
their
hair
and
put
on
their
clothes
miss
elizabeth
talbert
is
a
howling
swell
she
only
just
endures
it
here
i
heard
lots
of
things
about
her
from
bell
pickering
who
knows
the
munroes
lily
talbert
they
call
her
there
she
thinks
she
fond
of
art
but
she
really
does
know
the
first
thing
about
it
she
like
anything
that
is
expensive
and
elegant
and
a
la
mode
the
only
time
she
ever
came
to
see
me
she
actually
picked
her
way
around
the
house
when
i
was
showing
it
to
her
there
no
other
word
to
use
just
because
there
was
a
glass
of
jelly
on
the
sofa
and
the
painting
things
were
all
over
the
studio
with
peter
clothes
i
perfectly
hated
her
that
day
yet
i
do
love
to
look
at
her
and
i
can
see
how
she
might
be
terribly
nice
if
you
were
any
one
she
thought
worth
caring
for
there
have
been
times
when
i
seen
a
look
on
her
face
like
the
clear
ethereal
light
beyond
the
sunset
that
just
pulled
at
me
she
is
very
fond
of
peggy
i
know
she
would
never
do
anything
to
injure
peggy
poor
little
peggy
when
i
think
of
this
affair
about
harry
goward
i
do
believe
she
ever
felt
sure
of
him
that
is
why
she
is
so
worked
up
over
this
matter
now
i
know
there
was
something
that
i
felt
from
the
first
through
all
her
excitement
something
that
was
quite
happy
in
her
happiness
i
feel
atmospheres
at
once
i
just
ca
help
it
and
when
i
get
feeling
other
people
atmospheres
too
much
i
lose
my
own
and
then
i
ca
paint
i
began
so
well
the
other
day
with
the
picture
of
that
armenian
peddler
and
now
since
alice
left
i
ca
do
a
thing
with
it
his
bare
yellow
knees
look
just
like
ugly
i
wish
sally
was
in
she
ca
cook
but
she
can
do
a
worth
its
weight
in
gold
when
you
down
in
the
mouth
just
then
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
my
coming
in
for
a
minute
i
was
frightened
i
never
seen
her
look
like
that
before
so
white
and
almost
old
she
seemed
hardly
able
to
walk
and
i
ran
to
the
door
and
helped
her
in
and
put
her
in
a
chair
and
her
feet
on
a
footstool
and
got
her
my
dear
little
venetian
bottle
of
with
the
long
silver
chain
it
so
beautiful
it
makes
you
feel
better
just
to
look
at
it
i
whisked
peter
shoes
out
into
the
hall
and
when
i
sat
down
by
her
she
put
her
hand
out
to
me
and
said
dear
child
and
i
got
all
throaty
the
way
i
do
when
any
one
speaks
like
that
to
me
for
oh
i
have
been
lonesome
for
dad
and
momsey
and
my
own
dear
home
though
no
one
ever
seems
to
imagine
it
and
i
said
oh
ca
i
do
something
for
you
madonna
i
usually
just
call
her
you
but
once
in
a
great
while
when
there
nobody
else
around
i
call
her
madonna
and
i
know
she
likes
it
even
if
she
does
think
it
a
little
romish
or
sacrilegious
or
something
queer
but
she
said
she
did
want
anything
only
to
rest
a
few
minutes
and
that
there
was
something
she
wanted
me
to
tell
peter
she
could
come
in
the
evening
to
see
him
without
every
one
wanting
to
know
why
she
came
there
was
some
terrible
trouble
about
peggy
engagement
she
flushed
up
and
hesitated
and
when
i
broke
in
to
say
you
bother
to
explain
i
know
all
about
the
whole
thing
she
did
seem
at
all
surprised
or
ask
how
i
knew
she
only
seemed
relieved
to
find
that
she
could
go
right
on
i
never
can
be
demonstrative
to
her
before
people
but
i
just
put
my
arms
around
her
now
when
she
said
it
a
great
comfort
to
be
able
to
come
to
you
lorraine
and
speak
out
at
home
your
dear
grandmother
considers
me
so
much
she
only
thinks
of
everything
as
it
affects
me
but
it
makes
it
so
that
i
ca
always
show
what
i
feel
for
if
i
do
she
gets
all
can
think
of
is
peggy
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
me
just
now
when
my
little
peggy
went
away
from
me
and
locked
herself
in
her
room
peggy
who
all
her
life
has
always
come
to
me
for
comfort
she
stopped
for
a
minute
and
i
patted
her
it
was
so
unlike
my
to
speak
in
this
way
she
usually
so
that
it
made
me
sort
of
awestruck
after
a
moment
she
went
on
in
a
different
voice
they
all
want
me
to
tell
cyrus
your
father
that
aunt
elizabeth
has
been
trying
to
take
goward
affections
away
from
peggy
i
afraid
it
just
what
she
has
been
doing
though
it
seems
incredible
that
she
should
have
any
attraction
for
a
young
man
i
was
glad
elizabeth
had
gone
away
overnight
for
maria
is
in
such
a
state
i
do
know
what
might
have
and
do
you
want
to
tell
father
i
gulped
but
i
knew
i
must
say
it
why
not
madonna
she
shook
her
head
with
that
look
that
makes
you
feel
sometimes
that
she
is
just
the
gentle
and
placid
person
that
she
appears
to
be
i
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
very
clear
and
strong
if
i
could
paint
her
with
an
expression
like
that
i
make
my
fortune
no
lorraine
if
it
was
about
anybody
but
your
aunt
elizabeth
i
would
but
i
ca
speak
against
her
it
her
home
as
well
as
mine
always
realized
that
i
made
up
my
mind
when
i
married
that
i
never
would
come
between
brother
and
sister
and
i
never
have
aunt
elizabeth
does
know
how
many
times
i
have
smoothed
matters
over
for
her
how
many
times
cyrus
has
been
provoked
because
he
thought
she
did
show
enough
consideration
for
me
i
have
always
loved
aunt
elizabeth
and
i
believed
she
loved
us
but
when
i
saw
my
peggy
lorraine
i
could
go
and
tell
your
father
about
aunt
elizabeth
while
i
feel
as
i
do
now
i
could
be
just
if
i
made
him
angry
with
her
she
stopped
and
i
did
need
to
have
her
go
on
my
is
one
of
those
big
kind
sensible
men
who
when
they
do
get
angry
go
clear
off
the
handle
and
are
so
absolutely
furious
and
unreasonable
you
ca
do
anything
with
them
he
got
that
way
at
peter
once
but
it
makes
me
so
furious
myself
when
i
think
of
it
that
i
never
do
and
lorraine
madonna
went
on
quite
simply
bringing
all
this
home
to
aunt
elizabeth
and
making
her
pay
up
for
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
peggy
happiness
it
is
my
child
happiness
that
i
want
lorraine
there
may
be
a
misunderstanding
of
some
kind
misunderstandings
are
very
cruel
things
sometimes
lorraine
i
can
not
believe
that
boy
does
care
for
her
why
he
loved
her
dearly
it
seems
to
me
far
the
best
and
most
dignified
thing
to
just
write
to
goward
himself
and
find
out
the
i
think
so
too
said
i
oh
madonna
you
a
jim
dandy
and
so
she
went
on
i
want
you
to
ask
charles
edward
to
write
i
leave
the
address
with
you
as
peggy
brother
it
will
be
more
suitable
for
him
to
attend
to
the
charles
edward
i
simply
gasped
the
idea
of
peter
writing
to
harry
goward
to
ask
him
the
state
of
his
affections
if
peter
mother
could
realize
how
perfectly
impossible
it
was
for
even
me
to
make
peter
do
a
thing
that
well
i
was
knocked
silly
dear
madonna
is
the
survival
of
a
period
when
a
woman
always
expected
some
man
to
face
any
crisis
for
her
all
i
could
do
was
to
say
resignedly
i
give
him
the
and
when
she
got
up
i
went
to
the
gate
with
her
she
was
as
dear
as
she
could
be
i
just
loved
her
until
she
happened
to
say
when
i
came
in
i
thought
you
might
be
lying
down
for
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
shades
were
pulled
down
in
your
room
as
they
are
oh
i
said
i
do
suppose
anybody
has
been
back
in
the
room
since
we
got
and
i
was
downright
scared
she
looked
at
me
so
strangely
and
began
to
tremble
all
over
what
is
the
matter
i
cried
do
come
into
the
house
again
but
she
only
grasped
my
arm
and
said
tragically
lorraine
it
is
possible
that
you
have
made
your
bed
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
i
answered
oh
i
always
make
it
up
before
i
sleep
in
and
then
i
knew
that
said
just
the
wrong
thing
what
difference
it
can
make
to
anybody
what
time
you
make
your
own
bed
i
ca
see
she
tried
to
make
me
promise
i
always
make
it
up
before
ten
in
the
morning
why
i
even
promise
to
always
feel
fond
of
peter
at
ten
in
the
morning
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
family
without
always
feeling
on
edge
afterward
why
when
she
was
so
sweet
and
strong
about
peggy
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
all
the
rest
of
it
why
should
she
get
upset
about
such
a
trifle
i
stood
there
by
the
gate
just
glowering
as
she
went
off
i
knew
she
thought
i
was
going
to
perdition
i
was
sick
of
the
what
business
was
it
of
peter
and
mine
anyhow
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
us
really
then
i
thought
of
the
time
peter
and
i
quarrelled
and
how
dear
lyman
wilde
was
about
it
and
how
he
brought
peter
back
to
me
just
to
say
the
name
of
lyman
wilde
always
makes
me
feel
better
i
adore
him
and
always
shall
and
peter
knows
it
if
i
could
only
go
back
to
the
settlement
and
hear
him
say
little
girl
in
that
coaxing
voice
of
his
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
are
always
working
so
hard
for
other
people
that
you
forget
he
has
anything
for
himself
thinking
of
him
made
me
quite
chipper
again
and
i
went
in
and
got
his
picture
and
stuck
it
up
in
the
and
put
flowers
in
front
of
it
when
peter
came
in
i
told
him
about
everything
and
of
course
he
refused
to
write
to
harry
goward
as
i
knew
he
would
he
said
it
was
all
rot
anyway
and
that
harry
was
a
nice
boy
but
not
worth
making
such
a
fuss
over
he
did
know
that
he
was
particularly
stuck
on
marrying
harry
goward
anyway
but
there
was
no
use
in
any
interfering
peggy
was
the
person
to
write
finally
he
said
telephone
to
harry
the
next
day
to
come
out
and
stay
at
our
house
over
sunday
and
then
he
and
peggy
could
have
a
chance
to
settle
it
but
peter
did
telephone
he
was
late
at
the
works
the
next
day
though
not
nearly
so
late
as
he
often
is
but
talbert
has
a
perfect
fad
about
every
one
getting
there
on
time
it
one
of
the
things
there
always
been
a
tug
about
between
him
and
peter
i
should
think
he
have
realized
long
ago
that
peter
never
will
be
on
time
and
just
make
up
his
mind
to
it
but
he
wo
well
peter
came
back
again
to
the
house
a
little
after
nine
perfectly
white
he
said
he
never
enter
the
factory
again
his
father
was
in
a
towering
rage
when
peter
went
in
he
spoke
to
peter
so
that
every
one
could
hear
him
and
then
oh
it
was
a
dreadful
time
alice
told
me
afterward
that
maria
had
found
her
father
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
she
insinuated
in
her
way
all
kinds
of
dreadful
things
about
harry
goward
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
there
was
a
scene
at
the
and
peggy
was
taken
so
ill
that
they
had
to
send
for
denbigh
i
do
know
what
will
happen
when
aunt
elizabeth
comes
home
the
by
elizabeth
jordan
except
for
billy
who
is
a
boy
and
does
not
count
i
am
the
youngest
person
in
our
family
and
when
i
tell
you
that
there
are
eleven
of
us
well
you
can
dimly
imagine
the
kind
of
a
time
i
have
two
or
three
days
ago
i
heard
grandma
evarts
say
something
to
the
minister
about
the
and
oppressed
of
foreign
lands
and
after
he
had
gone
i
asked
her
what
they
were
for
a
wonder
she
told
me
usually
when
billy
and
i
ask
questions
you
would
think
the
whole
family
had
been
struck
dumb
but
this
time
she
answered
and
i
remember
every
word
for
if
ever
anything
sounded
like
a
description
of
billy
and
me
it
was
what
grandma
evarts
said
that
day
i
told
her
so
too
but
of
course
she
only
looked
at
me
over
her
spectacles
and
did
understand
what
i
meant
nobody
ever
does
except
billy
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
they
not
much
comfort
billy
is
always
so
busy
getting
into
trouble
and
having
me
get
him
out
of
it
and
feeling
sorry
for
himself
that
he
has
time
to
sympathize
with
me
besides
as
i
said
before
he
only
a
boy
and
you
know
what
boys
are
and
how
they
lack
the
delicate
feelings
girls
have
and
how
their
minds
never
work
when
you
want
them
to
as
for
aunt
elizabeth
she
is
lovely
sometimes
and
the
way
she
remembers
things
that
happened
when
she
was
young
is
simply
wonderful
she
knows
how
girls
feel
too
and
how
they
suffer
when
they
are
like
denbigh
says
i
am
very
nervous
and
sensitive
and
but
she
admitted
to
me
that
she
had
never
before
really
made
up
her
mind
whether
i
am
the
sweet
unsophisticated
child
she
calls
me
or
what
tom
price
says
i
am
the
eastridge
animated
and
undaunted
daily
bugle
and
clarion
call
he
calls
me
that
because
i
know
so
much
about
what
is
going
on
and
he
says
if
temple
could
get
me
on
his
paper
as
a
regular
contributor
there
would
be
a
domestic
left
in
eastridge
he
says
the
things
i
drop
will
break
every
last
one
of
them
anyhow
beginning
with
the
one
at
home
that
the
way
he
talks
and
though
i
do
always
know
exactly
what
he
means
i
can
tell
by
his
expression
that
it
is
not
very
complimentary
aunt
elizabeth
is
different
from
the
others
and
she
and
i
have
inspiring
conversations
sometimes
serious
ones
you
know
about
life
and
responsibility
and
careers
and
then
at
other
times
just
when
i
revealing
my
young
heart
to
her
the
way
girls
do
in
books
she
gets
or
laughs
at
me
or
stares
and
says
you
extraordinary
infant
and
changes
the
subject
at
first
it
used
to
hurt
me
dreadfully
but
now
i
beginning
to
think
she
does
it
when
she
answer
my
questions
i
asked
her
lots
and
lots
of
things
that
have
made
her
sit
up
and
gasp
i
can
tell
you
and
i
have
more
all
ready
as
soon
as
i
get
the
chance
there
is
another
thing
i
will
mention
while
i
think
of
it
grandma
evarts
is
always
talking
about
rules
of
life
but
the
only
rule
of
life
i
perfectly
sure
i
have
is
to
always
mention
things
when
i
think
of
them
even
that
does
please
the
family
though
because
sometimes
i
mention
things
they
thought
i
did
know
and
then
they
are
annoyed
and
cross
instead
of
learning
a
lesson
by
it
and
realizing
how
silly
it
is
to
try
to
keep
secrets
from
me
if
they
tell
me
and
put
me
on
my
honor
i
could
keep
their
old
secrets
as
well
as
anybody
i
kept
billy
for
years
and
years
but
when
they
all
stop
talking
the
minute
i
come
into
a
room
and
when
mamma
and
peggy
go
around
with
red
eyes
and
wo
say
why
you
better
believe
i
do
like
it
it
fills
me
with
the
intelligent
discontent
tom
is
always
talking
about
then
i
rest
until
i
know
what
there
is
to
know
and
usually
when
i
get
through
i
know
more
than
anybody
else
does
because
i
got
all
the
different
sides
maria
and
tom
and
lorraine
and
charles
edward
and
and
papa
and
grandma
and
peggy
and
aunt
elizabeth
it
is
that
they
intend
to
tell
me
things
either
they
all
try
not
to
every
one
of
them
keeps
her
own
secrets
beautifully
but
she
drops
things
about
the
others
then
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
put
them
together
like
a
quilt
you
need
think
it
easy
though
for
the
very
minute
i
get
near
any
of
the
family
they
waste
most
of
the
time
we
together
by
trying
to
improve
me
you
see
they
are
all
so
dreadfully
old
that
they
have
had
time
to
find
out
their
faults
and
youthful
errors
and
every
single
one
of
them
thinks
she
sees
all
her
faults
in
me
and
that
she
must
help
me
to
conquer
them
ere
it
is
too
late
aunt
elizabeth
says
they
mean
it
kindly
and
perhaps
they
do
but
if
you
have
ever
had
ten
men
and
women
trying
to
improve
you
you
will
know
what
my
life
is
tom
price
who
married
my
sister
maria
told
denbigh
once
that
every
time
a
talbert
is
unoccupied
he
or
she
puts
alice
or
billy
or
both
on
the
family
and
kneads
i
heard
him
say
it
and
true
all
can
say
is
that
if
they
keep
on
kneading
and
moulding
me
much
longer
there
wo
be
anything
left
but
a
kind
of
a
pulpy
mass
i
can
see
what
they
have
done
to
billy
already
he
getting
pulpier
every
day
and
i
do
believe
his
brain
would
ever
work
if
i
did
keep
stirring
it
up
however
the
thing
i
want
to
say
while
i
think
of
it
is
this
it
is
a
question
and
i
will
ask
it
here
because
there
is
no
use
of
asking
it
at
home
why
is
it
that
men
and
women
never
have
anything
really
interesting
to
say
to
a
girl
fifteen
years
old
then
if
you
can
answer
that
i
wish
you
would
answer
another
why
do
they
ever
listen
or
understand
what
a
girl
means
when
she
talks
to
them
billy
and
i
have
one
rule
now
when
we
want
to
say
something
serious
we
get
right
in
front
of
them
and
fix
them
with
a
glittering
eye
the
way
the
ancient
mariner
did
you
know
and
speak
as
slowly
as
we
can
in
little
bits
of
words
to
show
them
it
very
important
then
sometimes
they
pay
attention
and
answer
us
but
usually
they
act
as
if
we
were
babies
gurgling
in
cunning
little
cribs
and
the
rude
way
they
interrupt
us
often
and
go
on
talking
about
their
own
affairs
well
i
will
not
say
more
for
dear
mamma
has
taught
me
not
to
criticise
my
elders
and
i
never
do
but
i
watch
them
pretty
closely
just
the
same
and
when
i
see
them
doing
something
that
is
not
right
my
brain
works
so
hard
it
keeps
me
awake
nights
if
it
anything
very
dreadful
like
peggy
going
and
getting
engaged
i
point
out
the
error
the
way
they
always
pointing
errors
out
to
me
of
course
it
does
do
any
good
but
that
is
my
fault
it
because
they
have
got
what
my
teacher
calls
receptive
i
telling
you
all
this
before
i
tell
you
what
has
happened
so
you
will
be
sorry
for
billy
and
me
if
you
are
sorry
already
as
well
indeed
you
may
be
you
will
be
a
great
deal
more
sorry
before
i
get
through
for
if
ever
any
two
persons
were
downtrodden
and
oppressed
and
struggling
in
darkness
and
feeling
the
chill
waters
of
affliction
it
billy
and
me
all
because
we
tried
to
help
peggy
and
lorraine
and
aunt
elizabeth
after
they
had
got
everything
mixed
up
i
told
them
i
was
just
trying
to
help
and
tom
price
said
right
off
that
there
was
only
one
thing
for
billy
and
me
to
do
in
future
whenever
the
philanthropic
spirit
began
to
stir
in
us
and
that
was
to
get
on
board
the
suburban
and
go
as
far
away
from
home
as
our
nickels
would
take
us
and
not
hurry
back
so
you
see
he
is
not
a
bit
grateful
for
the
interesting
things
i
told
maria
i
will
now
tell
what
happened
it
began
the
day
billy
heard
the
station
agent
at
whitman
read
aunt
elizabeth
telegram
to
harry
goward
the
telegram
had
a
lot
of
silly
letters
and
words
in
it
so
billy
know
what
it
meant
and
of
course
he
did
care
the
careless
child
would
have
forgotten
all
about
it
if
i
had
happened
to
meet
him
at
lorraine
after
he
got
back
from
whitman
he
is
always
going
to
lorraine
for
some
of
sallie
cookies
she
makes
perfectly
delicious
ones
round
and
fat
and
crumbly
with
currants
on
the
top
billy
had
taken
so
many
that
his
pockets
bulged
out
on
the
sides
and
his
mouth
was
so
full
he
only
nodded
when
he
saw
me
so
of
course
i
stopped
to
tell
him
how
vulgar
that
was
and
piggish
and
to
see
if
he
had
left
any
for
me
and
he
was
so
anxious
to
divert
my
mind
that
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
began
to
talk
about
seeing
aunt
elizabeth
over
in
whitman
that
interested
me
so
i
got
the
whole
thing
out
of
him
and
the
very
minute
he
had
finished
telling
it
i
made
him
go
straight
and
tell
peggy
i
told
him
to
do
it
delicately
and
not
yell
it
out
i
thought
it
would
cheer
and
comfort
peggy
to
know
that
some
one
was
doing
something
instead
of
standing
around
and
looking
solemn
but
alas
it
did
not
and
billy
told
me
with
his
own
lips
that
it
was
simply
awful
to
see
peggy
face
even
he
noticed
it
so
it
must
have
been
pretty
bad
he
said
her
eyes
got
so
big
it
made
him
think
of
the
times
she
used
to
imitate
the
wolf
in
red
and
scare
us
to
death
when
we
were
young
when
billy
told
me
that
i
saw
that
perhaps
we
should
have
told
peggy
so
the
next
day
i
went
over
to
lorraine
again
to
ask
her
what
she
thought
about
it
i
stopped
at
noon
on
my
way
home
from
school
and
i
did
ring
the
bell
because
i
never
do
i
walked
right
in
as
usual
falling
over
the
books
and
teacups
and
magazines
on
the
floor
and
i
found
lorraine
sitting
at
the
with
her
head
down
among
the
little
cakes
and
bits
of
toast
left
over
from
the
afternoon
before
she
did
look
up
so
i
knew
she
had
heard
me
and
i
saw
her
shoulders
shake
and
then
i
knew
that
she
was
crying
i
had
never
seen
lorraine
cry
before
and
i
felt
dreadfully
but
i
did
know
just
what
to
do
or
what
to
say
and
while
i
stood
staring
at
her
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
photograph
on
the
table
with
a
lot
of
faded
flowers
the
face
of
the
photograph
was
up
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
picture
of
wilde
the
one
that
usually
stands
on
the
lorraine
is
always
talking
about
him
and
she
has
told
me
ever
and
ever
so
much
about
how
nice
and
kind
he
was
to
her
when
she
was
studying
art
in
new
york
but
of
course
i
did
know
she
cared
enough
for
him
to
cry
over
his
picture
and
it
gave
me
the
queerest
feelings
to
see
her
do
it
kind
of
wabbly
ones
in
my
legs
and
strange
sinking
ones
in
my
stomach
you
see
i
had
just
finished
reading
lady
hermione
terrible
secret
a
girl
at
school
lent
it
to
me
so
when
i
saw
lorraine
crying
over
a
photograph
and
faded
flowers
i
knew
it
must
mean
that
she
had
learned
to
love
wilde
with
a
love
that
was
her
doom
or
would
be
if
she
did
hurry
and
get
over
it
finally
i
crept
out
of
the
house
without
saying
a
word
to
her
or
letting
her
know
i
was
there
and
i
leaned
on
the
gate
to
think
it
over
and
try
to
imagine
what
a
girl
in
a
book
would
do
in
lady
hermione
her
sister
discovered
the
truth
and
tried
to
save
the
rash
woman
from
the
sad
consequences
of
her
love
so
i
knew
that
was
what
i
must
do
but
i
did
know
how
to
begin
while
i
was
standing
there
with
my
brain
going
round
like
one
of
billy
paper
pinwheels
some
one
stopped
in
front
of
me
and
said
hello
alice
in
a
sick
kind
of
a
way
like
a
boy
beginning
to
recite
a
piece
at
school
i
looked
up
it
was
harry
goward
you
better
believe
i
was
surprised
for
of
course
when
he
went
away
nobody
expected
he
would
come
back
so
soon
and
after
all
the
fuss
and
the
red
eyes
and
the
mystery
hoped
he
would
come
back
at
all
but
here
he
was
in
three
days
so
i
said
very
coldly
how
do
you
do
goward
and
bowed
in
a
distant
way
and
he
took
his
hat
off
quickly
and
held
it
in
his
hand
and
i
waited
for
him
to
say
something
else
all
he
did
for
a
minute
was
to
look
over
my
head
then
he
said
in
the
same
queer
voice
is
peter
in
i
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
her
and
he
put
his
hand
on
the
gate
to
open
it
i
suppose
it
was
dreadfully
rude
but
i
stayed
just
where
i
was
and
said
very
slowly
in
icy
tones
that
he
must
kindly
excuse
my
as
i
was
sure
she
would
be
able
to
receive
him
of
course
i
knew
she
would
want
him
or
any
one
else
to
come
in
and
see
her
cry
and
besides
i
never
liked
harry
goward
and
i
never
expect
to
he
looked
very
much
surprised
at
first
and
then
his
face
got
as
red
as
a
baby
does
when
there
a
pin
in
it
somewhere
and
he
asked
if
she
was
ill
i
said
no
she
is
not
ill
and
then
i
sighed
and
looked
off
down
the
street
as
if
i
would
i
were
alone
he
began
to
speak
very
quickly
but
stopped
and
bit
his
lip
then
he
turned
away
and
hesitated
and
finally
he
came
back
and
took
a
thick
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
me
he
was
smiling
now
and
for
a
minute
he
really
looked
nice
and
sweet
and
friendly
say
alice
he
said
in
the
most
coaxing
way
do
you
get
down
on
me
too
do
me
a
good
turn
that
a
dear
take
this
letter
home
and
deliver
it
will
you
and
say
i
at
the
hotel
waiting
for
an
now
you
can
see
yourself
that
this
was
thrilling
the
whole
family
was
watching
every
mail
for
a
letter
from
harry
goward
and
here
he
was
offering
me
one
i
did
show
how
excited
i
was
i
just
took
the
letter
and
turned
it
over
so
i
could
see
the
address
and
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
and
said
coldly
that
i
would
deliver
it
with
pleasure
harry
goward
was
looking
quite
cheerful
again
but
he
said
in
a
worried
tone
that
he
hoped
i
would
forget
because
it
was
very
very
important
then
i
dismissed
him
with
a
haughty
bow
the
way
they
do
on
the
stage
and
this
time
he
put
his
hat
on
and
really
went
of
course
after
that
i
wanted
to
go
straight
home
with
the
letter
but
i
knew
it
would
do
to
leave
lorraine
bearing
her
terrible
burden
without
some
one
to
comfort
her
while
i
was
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
i
saw
billy
a
block
away
with
sidney
tracy
and
i
whistled
to
him
to
come
and
beckoned
with
both
hands
at
the
same
time
to
show
it
was
important
i
had
a
beautiful
idea
in
that
very
instant
i
planned
my
course
of
action
as
they
say
in
books
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
send
the
letter
home
by
billy
and
that
would
give
me
time
to
run
over
to
maria
and
get
something
to
eat
and
ask
maria
to
go
and
comfort
lorraine
maria
and
lorraine
do
like
each
other
very
much
but
i
knew
trouble
might
bring
them
closer
for
grandma
evarts
says
it
always
does
besides
maria
is
dreadfully
old
and
knows
everything
and
is
the
one
the
family
always
sends
for
when
things
happen
if
they
do
send
she
comes
anyhow
and
tells
everybody
what
to
do
so
i
pinned
the
letter
in
pocket
so
he
could
lose
it
and
i
ordered
him
to
go
straight
home
with
it
he
said
he
would
he
looked
queer
and
i
thought
i
saw
him
drop
something
near
a
fence
before
he
came
to
me
but
i
was
so
excited
i
did
pay
close
attention
as
soon
as
billy
started
off
i
went
to
maria
she
was
all
alone
for
tom
was
lunching
with
some
one
at
the
hotel
when
we
were
at
the
table
i
told
her
about
lorraine
and
if
ever
any
one
was
excited
and
really
listened
this
time
it
was
sister
maria
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
spoke
right
out
before
she
thought
i
guess
charles
edward
wife
crying
over
another
man
picture
she
said
well
i
like
that
but
i
not
surprised
i
always
said
no
good
would
come
of
that
match
then
she
stopped
and
made
herself
quiet
down
but
i
could
see
how
hard
it
was
and
she
added
so
that
was
the
matter
with
charles
edward
when
i
met
him
this
morning
rushing
along
the
street
like
a
i
got
dreadfully
worried
then
and
begged
her
to
go
to
lorraine
at
once
for
i
saw
things
were
even
more
terrible
than
i
had
thought
but
maria
said
certainly
not
i
must
consult
with
father
and
mother
first
this
is
something
that
affects
us
all
after
i
have
seen
them
i
will
go
to
then
she
told
me
not
to
worry
about
it
and
not
to
speak
of
it
to
any
one
else
i
did
either
except
to
billy
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
when
i
told
aunt
elizabeth
the
man
name
i
thought
she
would
go
up
into
the
air
like
one
of
billy
skyrockets
but
that
part
does
not
belong
here
and
i
afraid
if
i
stop
to
talk
about
it
forget
about
billy
and
the
letter
after
luncheon
maria
put
her
hat
on
and
went
straight
to
our
house
to
see
mother
and
i
went
back
to
school
when
i
got
home
i
asked
the
first
thing
if
billy
had
delivered
the
letter
from
harry
goward
and
for
the
next
fifteen
minutes
you
would
have
thought
every
one
in
our
house
had
gone
crazy
that
wretched
boy
had
not
delivered
it
at
all
they
had
not
even
seen
him
and
they
did
know
anything
about
the
letter
after
they
had
let
me
get
enough
breath
to
tell
just
how
i
had
met
harry
and
exactly
what
he
had
said
and
done
mother
rushed
off
to
telephone
to
father
and
aunt
elizabeth
came
with
a
wild
eager
face
and
grandma
evarts
actually
shook
me
when
she
found
i
even
know
whom
the
letter
was
for
i
had
looked
because
i
had
been
so
excited
finally
after
everybody
had
talked
at
once
for
a
while
grandma
evans
told
me
mamma
had
said
billy
could
go
fishing
that
afternoon
because
the
weather
was
so
hot
and
she
thought
he
looked
pale
and
overworked
the
idea
of
billy
talbert
being
overworked
i
could
have
told
mamma
something
about
that
well
i
saw
through
the
whole
thing
then
billy
had
told
me
for
fear
i
would
want
to
go
along
so
he
had
sneaked
off
with
sidney
tracy
and
if
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
letter
he
had
made
up
his
mind
it
would
do
as
well
to
deliver
it
when
he
came
home
that
the
way
mind
works
like
tom
price
it
goes
up
to
a
certain
instant
and
then
it
stops
short
you
better
believe
i
was
angry
and
it
make
it
any
easier
for
me
to
remember
that
while
i
was
having
this
dreadful
time
at
home
and
being
reproached
by
everybody
billy
and
sidney
tracy
were
sitting
comfortably
under
the
willows
on
the
edge
of
the
river
pulling
little
minnows
out
of
the
water
i
knew
exactly
where
they
would
be
i
been
there
with
billy
often
enough
just
as
i
thought
of
that
i
looked
at
poor
peggy
sitting
in
her
wrapper
in
papa
big
leaning
against
a
pillow
grandma
evarts
had
put
behind
her
back
and
trying
to
be
calm
she
looked
so
pale
and
worn
and
worried
and
sick
that
i
made
up
my
mind
i
follow
those
boys
to
the
river
and
get
that
letter
and
bring
it
home
to
peggy
for
of
course
i
was
sure
it
was
for
her
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
face
when
i
said
i
do
it
and
the
way
she
jumped
up
from
the
chair
and
then
blushed
and
sank
back
and
tried
to
look
as
if
it
did
matter
with
her
eyes
shining
all
the
time
with
excitement
and
hope
i
got
on
my
bicycle
and
rode
off
and
i
made
good
time
until
i
crossed
the
bridge
then
i
had
to
walk
along
the
river
pushing
the
bicycle
and
i
came
to
those
two
boys
so
quietly
that
they
never
saw
me
until
i
was
right
behind
them
they
were
fishing
still
but
they
had
both
been
swimming
i
could
tell
that
by
their
wet
hair
and
by
the
damp
mussy
look
of
their
clothes
when
billy
saw
me
he
turned
red
and
began
to
make
a
great
fuss
over
his
line
he
did
say
a
word
he
never
does
when
he
surprised
or
ashamed
so
he
does
speak
very
often
anyhow
but
i
broke
the
painful
silence
by
saying
a
few
words
myself
i
told
billy
how
dreadful
he
had
made
everybody
feel
and
how
they
were
all
blaming
me
and
i
said
i
thank
him
for
that
letter
to
take
home
to
his
poor
suffering
sister
billy
put
down
his
rod
and
all
the
time
i
talked
he
was
going
through
his
pockets
one
after
the
other
and
getting
redder
and
redder
i
was
so
busy
talking
that
i
did
understand
at
first
just
what
this
meant
but
when
i
stopped
and
held
out
my
hand
and
looked
at
him
hard
i
saw
in
his
guilty
face
the
terrible
terrible
fear
that
he
had
lost
that
letter
and
i
was
so
frightened
that
my
legs
gave
way
under
me
and
i
sat
down
on
the
grass
in
my
fresh
blue
linen
dress
just
where
they
had
dripped
and
made
it
wet
all
this
time
sidney
tracy
was
going
through
his
pockets
too
and
just
as
i
was
getting
up
again
in
a
hurry
he
took
off
his
cap
and
emptied
his
pockets
into
it
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
what
that
cap
held
then
worms
and
sticky
and
tops
and
strings
and
hooks
and
marbles
and
two
pieces
of
molasses
candy
all
soft
and
messy
and
a
little
bit
of
a
turtle
and
a
green
toad
and
a
slice
of
and
a
dirty
soaking
handkerchief
that
he
and
billy
had
used
for
a
towel
there
was
something
else
there
too
a
dark
wet
pulpy
thing
with
pieces
of
gum
and
molasses
candy
and
other
things
sticking
to
it
sidney
took
it
out
and
held
it
toward
me
in
a
proud
way
there
your
letter
all
right
he
said
and
billy
gave
a
whoop
of
joy
and
called
out
alice
as
a
hint
for
me
to
hurry
home
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
the
letter
that
i
almost
took
it
but
i
stopped
in
time
i
had
any
gloves
on
and
it
was
just
too
dreadful
if
you
could
have
seen
it
you
would
never
have
touched
it
in
the
world
i
got
near
enough
to
look
at
it
though
and
then
i
saw
that
the
address
was
so
dirty
and
so
covered
with
gum
and
bait
and
candy
that
all
i
could
read
was
a
capital
m
and
a
small
s
at
the
beginning
and
an
ert
at
the
end
the
name
between
was
hidden
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hand
and
gasped
out
to
the
boys
that
i
wanted
the
things
taken
off
it
that
belong
there
and
when
i
looked
again
sidney
had
scraped
off
the
worst
of
it
and
was
scrubbing
the
envelope
with
his
wet
handkerchief
to
make
it
look
cleaner
after
that
you
could
tell
what
any
letter
was
so
i
just
groaned
and
snatched
it
from
his
hands
and
left
those
two
boys
in
their
disgusting
dirt
and
degradation
and
went
home
when
i
got
back
mamma
and
grandma
evarts
and
tom
price
and
peggy
and
aunt
elizabeth
were
in
the
parlor
looking
more
excited
than
ever
because
maria
had
been
there
telling
the
family
about
lorraine
then
she
had
gone
on
to
lorraine
and
tom
had
dropped
in
to
call
for
her
and
was
waiting
to
hear
about
the
letter
they
were
all
watching
the
door
when
i
came
in
and
peggy
and
aunt
elizabeth
started
to
get
up
but
sat
down
again
i
stood
there
hesitating
because
of
course
i
did
know
who
to
give
it
to
and
grandma
evarts
shot
out
well
alice
well
well
as
if
she
was
blowing
the
words
at
me
from
a
little
peashooter
then
i
began
to
explain
about
the
address
but
before
i
could
say
more
than
two
or
three
words
mamma
motioned
to
me
and
i
gave
the
letter
to
her
you
could
have
heard
an
autumn
leaf
fall
in
that
room
mamma
put
on
her
glasses
and
puzzled
over
the
smear
on
the
envelope
and
peggy
drew
a
long
breath
and
jumped
up
and
walked
over
to
mamma
and
held
out
her
hand
mamma
did
hesitate
a
minute
certainly
it
must
be
for
you
my
dear
she
said
and
then
she
added
in
a
very
cold
positive
way
for
whom
else
could
it
possibly
be
intended
no
one
spoke
but
just
as
peggy
had
put
her
finger
under
the
flap
to
tear
it
open
aunt
elizabeth
got
up
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
mamma
and
peggy
stood
she
spoke
very
softly
and
quietly
but
she
looked
queer
and
excited
wait
one
moment
my
dear
she
said
to
peggy
very
probably
the
letter
is
for
you
but
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
for
some
one
else
would
it
be
safer
wiser
for
me
to
open
it
then
peggy
cried
out
oh
aunt
elizabeth
how
dreadful
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
mother
had
hesitated
an
instant
when
aunt
elizabeth
spoke
but
now
she
drew
peggy
head
down
to
her
dear
comfy
shoulder
and
peggy
stayed
right
there
and
cried
as
hard
as
she
could
with
little
gasps
and
moans
as
if
she
felt
dreadfully
nervous
then
for
once
in
my
life
i
saw
my
mother
angry
she
looked
over
peggy
head
at
aunt
elizabeth
and
her
face
was
so
dreadful
it
made
me
shiver
elizabeth
she
said
and
she
brought
her
teeth
right
down
hard
on
the
word
this
is
the
climax
of
your
idiocy
have
you
the
audacity
to
claim
here
before
me
that
this
letter
from
my
child
affianced
husband
is
addressed
to
you
aunt
elizabeth
looked
very
pale
now
but
when
she
answered
she
spoke
as
quietly
as
before
if
it
is
ada
she
said
it
is
against
my
wish
and
my
command
but
it
may
then
her
voice
changed
as
if
she
were
really
begging
for
something
let
me
open
it
she
said
if
it
is
for
peggy
i
can
tell
by
the
first
line
or
two
even
if
he
does
not
use
the
name
surely
it
will
do
no
harm
if
i
glance
at
mother
looked
even
angrier
than
before
well
she
said
it
could
do
no
harm
you
think
if
you
read
a
letter
intended
for
peggy
but
you
do
dare
to
risk
letting
peggy
read
a
letter
addressed
by
harry
goward
to
you
this
is
intolerable
elizabeth
talbert
you
have
passed
the
limit
of
my
endurance
and
of
my
she
brought
out
the
last
words
very
slowly
looking
aunt
elizabeth
straight
in
the
eyes
and
aunt
elizabeth
looked
back
with
her
head
very
high
she
has
a
lovely
way
of
using
such
expressions
as
for
the
rest
and
as
to
that
and
she
did
it
now
as
to
that
she
said
my
brother
must
speak
for
himself
no
one
regrets
more
bitterly
than
i
do
this
whole
most
unpleasant
affair
i
can
only
say
that
with
all
my
heart
i
am
trying
to
straighten
it
grandma
evarts
sniffed
just
then
so
loudly
that
we
all
looked
at
her
and
then
of
course
mamma
suddenly
remembered
that
i
was
still
there
regarding
the
scene
with
wide
intelligent
young
eyes
and
she
nodded
toward
the
door
meaning
for
me
to
go
out
my
but
i
hated
to
i
picked
up
grandma
ball
of
wool
and
drew
the
footstool
close
to
her
feet
and
looked
around
to
see
if
i
could
show
her
some
other
delicate
girlish
attention
such
as
old
ladies
love
but
there
was
anything
especially
as
grandma
kept
motioning
for
me
to
leave
so
i
walked
toward
the
door
very
slowly
and
before
i
got
there
i
heard
tom
price
say
oh
come
now
we
making
a
lot
of
fuss
about
nothing
there
a
very
simple
way
out
of
all
this
alice
says
goward
still
at
the
hotel
i
just
run
down
there
and
explain
and
ask
him
to
whom
that
letter
then
i
was
at
the
door
and
i
had
to
open
it
and
go
out
the
voices
went
on
inside
for
a
few
minutes
but
soon
i
saw
tom
come
out
and
i
went
to
him
and
slipped
my
arm
inside
of
his
and
walked
with
him
across
the
lawn
and
out
to
the
sidewalk
i
do
very
often
like
the
things
tom
says
but
i
thought
it
was
clever
of
him
to
think
of
going
to
ask
harry
goward
about
the
letter
and
i
told
him
so
to
encourage
him
he
thanked
me
very
politely
and
then
he
stopped
and
braced
his
back
against
the
on
the
corner
and
fixed
me
with
a
stern
gaze
as
writers
say
look
here
clarry
he
said
clarry
is
short
he
says
for
daily
bugle
and
clarion
call
which
is
too
lengthy
for
frequent
use
you
doing
a
lot
of
mischief
with
your
rural
delivery
system
for
goward
and
your
news
extras
about
lorraine
what
this
story
you
got
up
about
her
anyway
i
told
him
just
what
i
had
seen
when
i
got
through
he
said
there
was
nothing
in
that
bit
about
her
head
being
among
the
toast
and
cake
he
went
on
would
be
convincing
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
tragedy
if
it
had
been
any
other
woman
head
but
it
does
count
with
lorraine
i
mean
it
does
represent
the
complete
abandonment
to
grief
which
would
be
implied
if
it
happened
in
the
case
of
any
one
else
you
must
remember
that
when
lorraine
wants
to
have
a
comfortable
cry
she
got
to
choose
between
putting
her
head
in
the
jam
on
the
sofa
or
among
the
wet
paint
and
brushes
in
the
or
among
the
crumbs
on
the
as
for
that
photograph
it
probably
fell
off
the
to
the
instead
of
falling
as
usual
into
the
to
sum
up
my
dear
clarry
if
you
had
remembered
the
extreme
emotionalism
of
your
sister
lorraine
temperament
and
the
er
eccentricity
of
her
housekeeping
you
would
not
have
permitted
yourself
to
be
so
sadly
misled
not
remembering
it
you
done
a
lot
of
mischief
all
these
things
being
so
no
one
will
believe
them
and
when
you
are
safely
tucked
into
your
little
bed
if
you
hear
the
tramping
of
many
feet
on
the
asphalt
walks
you
may
know
what
it
will
mean
it
will
mean
that
your
mother
and
father
and
elizabeth
and
grandma
evarts
and
maria
and
peggy
will
be
dropping
in
on
lorraine
each
alone
and
quite
casually
of
course
to
find
out
what
there
really
is
in
this
terrible
rumor
and
some
of
them
will
believe
to
their
dying
day
that
there
was
something
in
well
that
made
me
feel
very
unhappy
for
i
could
see
that
under
gay
exterior
and
funny
way
of
saying
things
he
really
meant
every
word
of
course
i
told
him
that
i
had
wanted
to
help
lorraine
and
peggy
because
they
were
so
wretched
and
he
made
me
promise
on
the
spot
that
if
ever
i
wanted
to
help
him
i
tell
him
about
it
first
then
he
went
off
to
the
hotel
looking
more
cheerful
and
i
was
left
alone
with
my
sad
thoughts
when
i
got
into
the
house
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
billy
sneaking
out
of
the
back
door
i
had
meant
to
have
a
long
and
earnest
talk
with
billy
the
minute
he
got
home
and
point
out
some
of
his
serious
faults
but
when
i
looked
at
him
i
saw
that
mamma
or
grandma
had
just
done
it
he
looked
red
eyed
and
miserable
and
the
minute
he
saw
me
he
began
to
whistle
billy
never
whistles
except
just
before
or
just
after
a
whipping
so
my
heart
sank
and
i
was
dreadfully
sorry
for
him
i
started
after
him
to
tell
him
so
but
he
made
a
face
at
me
and
ran
and
just
then
aunt
elizabeth
came
along
the
hall
and
dragged
me
up
to
her
room
and
began
to
ask
me
all
over
again
about
goward
and
all
that
he
said
whether
i
was
perfectly
sure
he
did
mention
any
name
she
looked
worried
and
unhappy
then
she
asked
about
lorraine
but
in
an
indifferent
voice
as
if
she
was
really
thinking
about
something
else
i
told
her
all
i
knew
but
she
did
say
a
word
or
pay
much
attention
until
i
mentioned
that
the
man
in
the
photograph
was
lyman
wilde
then
well
i
wish
you
had
seen
aunt
elizabeth
she
made
me
promise
afterwards
that
i
never
tell
a
single
soul
what
happened
and
i
wo
but
i
do
wish
sometimes
that
billy
and
i
lived
on
a
desert
island
where
there
was
anybody
else
i
just
ca
bear
being
home
when
everybody
is
so
unhappy
and
when
not
a
single
thing
i
do
helps
the
least
little
bit
vi
the
by
john
kendrick
bangs
on
the
whole
i
am
glad
our
family
is
no
larger
than
it
is
it
is
a
very
excellent
family
as
families
go
but
the
infinite
capacity
of
each
individual
in
it
for
making
trouble
and
adding
to
complications
already
sufficiently
complex
surpasses
anything
that
has
ever
before
come
into
my
personal
or
professional
experience
if
i
handle
my
end
of
this
miserable
affair
without
making
a
break
of
some
kind
or
other
i
shall
apply
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
a
high
place
in
the
diplomatic
service
for
mere
international
complications
are
compared
to
this
embroglio
in
which
goward
and
aunt
elizabeth
have
landed
us
all
i
think
i
shall
take
up
politics
and
try
to
get
myself
elected
to
the
legislature
anyhow
and
see
if
i
ca
get
a
bill
through
providing
that
when
a
man
marries
it
is
distinctly
understood
that
he
marries
his
wife
and
not
the
whole
of
his
wife
family
from
her
grandmother
down
through
her
maiden
aunts
sisters
cousins
little
brothers
et
including
the
latest
arrivals
in
kittens
in
my
judgment
it
ought
to
be
made
a
penal
offence
for
any
member
of
a
man
wife
family
to
live
on
the
same
continent
with
him
and
if
i
had
to
get
married
all
over
again
to
maria
and
i
do
it
with
as
much
delighted
happiness
as
ever
i
should
insist
upon
the
interpolation
of
a
line
in
the
marriage
ceremony
do
you
promise
to
love
honor
and
obey
your
wife
relatives
and
when
i
came
to
it
i
turn
and
face
the
congregation
and
answer
no
through
a
megaphone
so
loud
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
a
misunderstanding
as
to
precisely
where
i
stood
if
anybody
thinks
i
speak
with
an
unusual
degree
of
feeling
i
beg
to
inform
him
or
her
as
the
case
may
be
that
in
the
matter
of
relations
i
have
an
unusually
full
set
and
as
my
small
says
when
he
orates
about
his
collection
they
all
uncancelled
into
all
lives
a
certain
amount
of
must
fall
but
i
not
only
have
that
but
a
as
well
and
and
the
lord
knows
what
besides
i
must
say
that
as
far
as
my
is
concerned
i
had
more
luck
than
most
men
because
talbert
comes
pretty
close
to
the
ideal
in
matters
she
is
gentle
and
unoffending
she
prefers
minding
her
own
business
to
assuming
a
trust
control
of
other
affairs
but
her
mother
well
i
do
wish
any
ill
to
evarts
but
if
anybody
is
ambitious
to
adopt
an
orphan
lady
with
advice
on
tap
at
all
hours
in
all
matters
from
winter
flannels
to
the
conversion
of
the
hottentots
i
will
cheerfully
lead
him
to
the
goal
of
his
desires
and
with
alacrity
surrender
to
him
all
my
right
title
and
interest
in
her
at
the
same
time
i
will
give
him
a
deed
to
my
not
that
aunt
elizabeth
is
good
fun
for
she
is
and
i
enjoy
talking
to
her
and
wondering
what
she
will
do
next
fills
my
days
with
a
living
interest
but
i
like
her
better
if
she
belonged
in
some
other
fellow
family
i
do
suppose
i
can
blame
maria
under
all
the
circumstances
for
standing
up
for
the
various
members
of
her
family
when
they
are
attacked
which
she
does
with
much
vigorous
and
at
times
aggressive
loyalty
we
can
not
always
help
ourselves
in
the
matter
of
our
relations
some
are
born
relatives
some
achieve
relatives
and
others
have
relatives
thrust
upon
them
maria
was
born
to
hers
and
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
game
she
got
to
like
them
nay
even
cherish
and
protect
them
against
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
criticism
but
on
the
other
hand
i
think
she
ought
to
remember
that
while
i
achieved
some
of
them
with
my
eyes
open
the
rest
were
thrust
upon
me
when
i
was
defenceless
and
when
i
find
some
difficulty
in
adapting
myself
to
circumstances
as
is
frequently
the
case
she
should
be
more
lenient
to
my
incapacity
the
fact
that
i
am
a
lawyer
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
toe
the
mark
of
respect
for
the
authority
of
the
courts
all
day
whether
i
am
filled
with
contempt
for
the
court
or
not
and
it
is
pretty
hard
to
find
when
i
return
home
at
night
that
another
set
of
the
judiciary
in
the
form
of
maria
family
a
sort
of
domestic
supreme
court
controls
all
my
private
life
so
that
except
when
i
am
rambling
through
the
fields
alone
or
am
taking
my
bath
in
the
morning
i
can
not
give
my
feelings
full
and
free
expression
without
disturbing
the
family
entente
and
there
is
much
satisfaction
in
skinning
people
to
a
lonesome
cow
or
whispering
your
indignant
sentiments
into
the
ear
of
a
sponge
already
soaked
to
the
full
with
cold
water
i
have
tried
all
my
married
life
to
agree
with
every
member
of
the
family
in
everything
he
she
or
it
has
said
but
now
that
this
goward
business
has
come
up
i
ca
do
that
because
every
time
anybody
says
booh
to
anybody
else
in
the
family
circle
regarding
this
duplex
a
family
council
is
immediately
called
and
booh
is
discussed
not
only
from
every
possible
but
from
several
impossible
ones
as
well
when
that
letter
of
goward
was
rescued
from
the
contingent
with
its
address
left
behind
upon
the
pulpy
surface
of
sidney
tracy
daily
portion
of
it
was
thought
best
that
i
should
call
upon
the
writer
at
his
hotel
and
find
out
to
whom
the
letter
was
really
written
my
own
first
thought
was
to
seek
out
sidney
tracy
and
see
if
the
superscription
still
remained
on
the
and
i
had
the
to
meet
the
boy
on
my
way
to
the
hotel
but
on
questioning
him
i
learned
that
in
the
excitement
of
catching
a
catfish
shortly
after
alice
had
left
the
lads
sidney
had
incontinently
swallowed
the
substance
and
nothing
short
of
an
operation
for
appendicitis
was
likely
to
put
me
in
possession
of
the
missing
exhibit
so
i
went
on
to
the
hotel
and
ten
minutes
later
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
interesting
case
of
nervous
prostration
poor
goward
when
i
observed
the
condition
of
his
nerves
i
was
immediately
so
filled
with
pity
for
him
that
if
it
had
been
for
maria
i
think
i
should
at
once
have
assumed
charge
of
his
case
and
as
his
personal
counsel
sued
the
family
for
damages
on
his
behalf
he
did
not
strike
me
as
being
either
old
enough
or
sufficiently
gifted
in
the
arts
of
philandery
to
be
taken
seriously
as
a
professional
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
to
restrain
myself
several
times
from
telling
him
that
i
thought
the
whole
affair
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
because
in
wanting
consciously
to
marry
two
members
of
the
family
he
had
only
attempted
to
do
what
i
had
done
unconsciously
when
i
and
the
whole
tribe
of
talberts
remotely
and
immediately
connected
became
one
nevertheless
i
addressed
him
coldly
mr
goward
i
said
when
the
first
greetings
were
over
this
is
a
most
unfortunate
it
is
terrible
he
groaned
pacing
the
floor
like
a
poor
caged
beast
in
the
narrow
confines
of
the
zoo
you
do
need
to
tell
me
how
unfortunate
it
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
went
on
i
do
exactly
recall
a
similar
case
in
my
experience
you
will
doubtless
admit
yourself
that
it
is
a
bit
unusual
for
a
man
even
of
your
age
to
flirt
with
the
maiden
aunt
of
his
fiancee
and
possibly
you
realize
that
we
would
all
be
very
much
relieved
if
you
could
give
us
some
reasonable
explanation
of
your
i
be
only
too
glad
to
explain
said
goward
if
you
will
only
in
my
own
judgment
the
best
solution
of
the
tangle
would
be
for
you
to
elope
with
a
third
party
at
your
earliest
convenience
i
continued
but
inasmuch
as
you
have
come
here
it
is
evident
that
you
mean
to
pursue
some
course
of
action
in
respect
to
one
of
the
two
ladies
my
sister
or
my
aunt
now
what
is
that
course
and
which
of
the
two
ladies
may
we
regard
as
the
real
object
of
your
vagrom
affections
i
tell
you
frankly
before
you
begin
that
i
shall
permit
no
trifling
with
peggy
as
to
aunt
elizabeth
she
is
quite
able
to
take
care
of
it
it
peggy
of
course
said
goward
i
admire
miss
elizabeth
talbert
very
much
indeed
but
i
never
really
thought
of
being
seriously
engaged
to
ah
said
i
icily
and
did
you
think
of
being
frivolously
engaged
to
her
i
not
only
thought
of
it
said
goward
but
i
was
it
was
at
the
abercrombies
price
lily
that
is
to
say
aunt
elizabeth
excuse
me
goward
i
interrupted
as
yet
the
lady
is
not
your
aunt
elizabeth
and
the
way
things
look
now
i
have
my
doubts
if
she
ever
is
your
aunt
miss
talbert
then
said
goward
with
a
sigh
miss
talbert
and
i
were
guests
at
the
abercrombies
last
october
maybe
told
you
and
on
we
had
a
party
and
the
mirror
trick
and
all
that
and
somehow
or
other
miss
talbert
and
i
were
thrown
together
a
great
deal
and
before
i
really
knew
how
or
why
we
well
we
became
engaged
for
for
the
week
i
see
said
i
dryly
you
played
the
farce
for
a
limited
we
joked
about
it
a
great
deal
and
i
well
i
got
into
the
spirit
of
it
one
must
at
you
know
said
goward
deprecatingly
i
suppose
so
said
i
i
got
into
the
spirit
of
it
and
miss
talbert
christened
me
young
lochinvar
junior
goward
went
on
and
i
did
my
best
to
live
up
to
the
title
then
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
was
suddenly
called
home
and
i
did
have
any
chance
to
see
miss
talbert
alone
before
leaving
and
well
the
engagement
was
broken
off
that
all
i
never
saw
her
again
until
i
came
here
to
meet
the
family
i
did
know
she
was
peggy
so
that
in
reality
you
were
engaged
to
both
peggy
and
miss
talbert
at
the
same
time
i
suggested
that
much
seems
to
be
i
suppose
so
groaned
goward
but
not
seriously
engaged
price
i
did
suppose
she
would
think
it
was
serious
just
a
lark
but
when
she
appeared
that
night
and
fixed
me
with
her
eye
i
suddenly
realized
what
had
it
was
another
case
of
woman
tempted
me
and
i
did
eat
was
it
goward
i
asked
goward
pale
face
hushed
and
he
turned
angrily
i
have
said
anything
of
the
sort
he
retorted
of
all
the
unmanly
sneaking
excuses
that
ever
were
offered
for
that
first
of
adam
has
never
been
you
evidently
do
think
that
adam
was
a
gentleman
i
put
in
with
a
feeling
of
relief
at
the
boy
attitude
toward
my
suggestion
not
according
to
my
standards
he
said
with
warmth
well
i
ventured
he
had
had
many
opportunities
adam
had
his
outlook
was
rather
provincial
and
his
associations
not
broadening
you
would
have
been
much
better
yourself
brought
up
in
a
zoo
nevertheless
i
do
think
myself
that
he
toed
the
mark
as
straight
as
he
might
he
was
a
coward
said
goward
with
a
positiveness
born
of
conviction
and
with
that
remark
goward
took
his
place
in
my
affections
whatever
the
degree
of
his
seeming
offence
he
was
at
least
a
gentleman
himself
and
his
unwillingness
to
place
any
part
of
the
blame
for
his
conduct
upon
aunt
elizabeth
showed
me
that
he
was
not
a
cad
and
i
began
to
feel
pretty
confident
that
some
reasonable
way
out
of
our
troubles
was
looming
into
sight
how
old
are
you
goward
i
asked
he
answered
counting
the
years
if
you
count
the
last
week
by
the
awful
hours
it
has
contained
i
am
older
than
at
last
i
thought
i
had
it
and
a
feeling
of
wrath
against
aunt
elizabeth
began
to
surge
up
within
me
it
was
another
case
of
that
intolerable
only
a
boy
habit
that
so
many
women
of
uncertain
age
and
character
married
and
single
seem
nowadays
to
find
so
much
pleasure
in
we
find
it
too
often
in
our
complex
modern
society
and
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
responsible
for
more
deviations
from
the
path
of
rectitude
than
even
the
offenders
themselves
imagine
callow
youth
just
from
college
is
susceptible
to
many
kinds
of
flattery
and
at
the
age
of
adolescence
the
appeal
which
lovely
woman
makes
to
inexperience
is
irresistible
i
know
whereof
i
speak
for
i
have
been
there
myself
i
always
tell
maria
everything
that
i
conveniently
can
it
is
not
well
for
a
man
to
have
secrets
from
his
wife
and
when
i
occasionally
refer
to
my
past
flames
i
find
myself
often
growing
more
than
pridefully
loquacious
over
my
early
affairs
of
the
heart
but
when
i
thought
of
the
serious
study
that
i
once
made
in
my
twentieth
year
of
the
dozen
easiest
most
painless
methods
of
committing
suicide
because
miss
mehitabel
flanders
aetat
whom
i
had
chosen
for
my
life
companion
had
announced
her
intention
of
marrying
old
colonel
barrington
one
of
the
wisest
matches
ever
as
i
see
it
now
i
drew
the
line
at
letting
maria
into
that
particular
secret
of
my
career
miss
mehitabel
was
indeed
a
beautiful
woman
and
she
took
a
very
deep
and
possibly
maternal
interest
in
callow
youth
she
invited
confidence
and
managed
in
many
ways
to
make
a
strong
appeal
to
youthful
affections
but
i
do
think
she
was
always
careful
to
draw
the
line
nicely
between
maternal
love
and
that
other
which
is
neither
maternal
fraternal
paternal
nor
even
filial
to
my
eye
she
was
no
older
than
i
and
to
my
way
of
thinking
nothing
could
have
been
more
eminently
fitting
than
that
we
should
walk
the
primrose
way
hand
in
hand
forever
while
i
will
not
say
that
the
fair
mehitabel
trifled
with
my
young
affections
i
will
say
that
she
let
me
believe
nay
induced
me
to
believe
by
her
manner
that
even
as
i
regarded
her
she
regarded
me
and
when
at
the
end
she
disclaimed
any
intention
to
smash
my
heart
into
the
myriad
atoms
into
which
it
flew
which
have
since
most
happily
reunited
upon
maria
and
asserted
that
she
had
let
me
play
in
the
of
my
exuberant
fancy
because
i
was
only
a
boy
my
bump
upon
the
hard
world
of
fact
was
an
atrociously
hard
one
some
women
pour
passer
le
temps
find
pleasure
in
playing
thus
with
young
hopes
and
hearts
as
carelessly
as
though
they
were
mere
to
be
whacked
about
and
rallied
and
volleyed
hither
and
yon
without
regard
to
their
constituent
ingredients
and
then
when
trouble
comes
and
a
catastrophe
is
imminent
the
refuge
of
only
a
boy
is
sought
as
though
it
really
afforded
a
sufficient
protection
against
the
most
of
us
would
regard
the
hopeless
infatuation
of
a
young
girl
committed
to
our
care
either
as
parents
or
as
guardians
for
a
man
of
the
world
with
such
horror
that
drastic
steps
would
be
taken
to
stop
it
but
we
are
not
so
careful
of
the
of
our
sons
and
view
with
complaisance
their
devotion
to
some
blessed
damozel
of
uncertain
age
comforting
ourselves
with
the
reflection
that
he
is
only
a
boy
and
will
outgrow
it
all
in
good
time
there
another
mem
for
my
legislative
career
a
bill
for
the
protection
of
boys
and
the
suppression
of
old
maids
who
do
mean
anything
by
it
i
do
mean
in
saying
all
this
to
reflect
in
any
way
upon
the
many
helpful
friendships
that
exist
between
youngsters
developing
into
manhood
and
their
elders
among
women
who
are
not
related
to
them
there
have
been
thousands
of
such
friendships
no
doubt
that
have
worked
for
the
upbuilding
of
character
for
the
inspiring
in
the
unfolding
consciousness
of
what
life
means
in
the
young
boy
being
of
a
deeper
more
lasting
respect
for
womanhood
than
would
have
been
attained
to
under
any
other
circumstances
but
that
has
been
the
result
only
when
the
woman
has
taken
care
to
maintain
her
own
dignity
always
and
to
regard
her
course
as
one
wherein
she
has
accepted
a
degree
of
responsibility
second
only
to
a
mother
and
not
a
leading
merely
to
pleasure
and
for
the
idling
away
of
an
unoccupied
hour
potential
manhood
is
a
difficult
force
to
handle
and
none
should
embark
upon
the
parlous
enterprise
of
arousing
it
without
due
regard
for
the
consequences
we
may
not
let
loose
a
young
lion
from
its
leash
and
when
dire
consequences
follow
excuse
ourselves
on
the
score
that
we
thought
the
devastating
feature
was
only
a
these
things
flashed
across
my
mind
as
i
sat
in
goward
room
watching
the
poor
youth
in
his
struggles
and
when
i
thought
of
the
tangible
evidence
in
hand
against
aunt
elizabeth
i
must
confess
if
i
had
been
juryman
sitting
in
judgment
of
the
case
i
should
have
convicted
her
of
kidnapping
without
leaving
the
box
to
begin
with
there
was
the
case
of
ned
temple
i
have
quite
been
able
to
get
away
from
the
notion
that
however
and
gauche
poor
performance
was
in
going
over
to
the
talberts
to
make
a
scene
because
of
aunt
elizabeth
attentions
to
temple
she
thought
she
was
justified
in
doing
so
and
elizabeth
entire
innocence
in
the
premises
in
view
of
her
record
as
a
has
not
been
proven
to
my
satisfaction
then
there
was
that
lyman
wilde
business
which
i
never
understood
and
have
wanted
to
until
they
tried
to
mix
poor
lorraine
up
in
it
certain
it
is
that
elizabeth
and
wilde
were
victims
of
an
affair
of
the
heart
but
what
lorraine
has
had
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
and
i
hope
the
whole
matter
will
be
dropped
at
least
until
we
have
settled
poor
peggy
affair
then
came
goward
and
this
complication
and
through
it
all
elizabeth
has
had
a
open
for
denbigh
a
rather
suggestive
chain
of
evidence
that
proving
that
elizabeth
seems
to
regard
all
men
as
her
own
individual
property
as
evarts
says
she
perks
up
even
when
billie
comes
into
the
room
or
talbert
either
and
as
for
me
well
in
the
strictest
confidence
if
aunt
elizabeth
has
tried
to
flirt
even
with
me
then
i
do
know
what
flirtation
is
and
there
was
a
time
long
before
i
was
married
of
course
when
i
possessed
certain
gifts
in
that
line
i
know
this
that
when
i
was
first
paying
my
addresses
to
maria
aunt
elizabeth
was
staying
at
the
talberts
as
usual
and
maria
and
i
had
all
we
could
do
to
get
rid
of
her
she
seemed
to
be
possessed
with
the
idea
that
i
came
there
every
night
to
see
her
and
not
a
hint
in
the
whole
category
of
polite
intimations
seemed
capable
of
conveying
any
other
idea
to
her
mind
although
she
showed
at
times
that
even
a
chance
remark
fell
upon
heeding
ears
for
once
when
i
observed
that
pink
was
my
favorite
color
she
blossomed
out
in
it
the
next
day
and
met
me
looking
like
a
in
full
bloom
on
main
street
as
i
walked
from
my
office
up
home
and
while
we
are
discussing
other
people
weaknesses
i
may
as
well
confess
my
own
and
say
that
i
was
so
pleased
at
this
unexpected
revelation
of
interest
in
my
tastes
that
when
i
called
that
evening
i
felt
vaguely
disappointed
to
learn
that
aunt
elizabeth
was
dining
out
and
i
was
at
the
time
too
and
loved
maria
into
the
bargain
and
after
the
wedding
when
we
came
to
say
and
i
kissed
aunt
elizabeth
i
kissed
everybody
that
day
in
the
hurry
to
get
away
even
the
hired
man
at
the
door
and
said
aunty
she
pouted
and
said
she
did
like
the
title
a
little
now
of
course
i
would
have
anybody
think
that
i
think
aunt
elizabeth
was
ever
in
love
with
me
but
i
mention
these
things
to
show
her
general
attitude
toward
members
of
the
stronger
sex
the
chances
are
that
she
does
not
realize
what
she
is
doing
and
assumes
this
coy
method
with
the
whole
masculine
contingent
as
a
matter
of
thoughtless
habit
what
she
wants
to
be
to
man
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
even
guess
mother
sister
daughter
or
general
manager
but
that
she
does
wish
to
grab
every
male
being
in
sight
and
attach
them
to
her
train
is
pretty
evident
to
me
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
what
happened
in
poor
harry
goward
case
she
has
a
bright
way
of
saying
things
is
unmistakably
pretty
and
has
an
unhappy
knack
of
making
herself
appear
ten
or
fifteen
years
younger
than
she
is
if
she
needs
to
she
is
chameleonic
as
to
age
and
takes
on
always
something
of
the
years
of
the
particular
man
she
is
talking
to
i
saw
her
talking
to
the
dominie
the
other
night
and
a
more
bit
of
demure
piety
you
never
saw
in
a
nunnery
and
the
very
next
day
when
she
was
conversing
with
young
george
harris
a
freshman
at
yale
at
the
barbers
reception
you
have
thought
she
was
herself
a
vassar
undergraduate
so
there
you
are
with
goward
she
had
assumed
that
same
youthful
manner
and
backed
by
all
the
power
other
years
of
experience
he
was
mere
putty
in
her
hands
and
she
played
with
him
and
he
lost
just
as
any
other
man
from
anthony
down
to
the
boniest
ossified
man
of
would
have
lost
and
it
was
until
he
saw
peggy
again
and
realized
the
difference
between
the
real
thing
and
the
spurious
that
he
waked
up
with
all
these
facts
marshalled
and
flashing
through
my
brain
much
more
rapidly
than
i
can
tell
them
like
the
quick
succession
of
pictures
in
the
cinematograph
i
made
up
my
mind
to
become
goward
friend
in
so
far
as
circumstances
would
permit
with
aunt
elizabeth
out
of
the
way
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
would
find
all
plain
sailing
again
but
how
to
get
rid
other
was
the
awful
question
poor
peggy
could
hardly
be
happy
with
such
a
richmond
in
the
field
and
nothing
short
of
engagement
to
some
other
man
would
help
matters
any
she
had
been
too
long
unmarried
anyhow
maiden
aunthood
is
an
unhappy
estate
and
grows
worse
with
habit
if
i
could
only
find
lyman
wilde
and
bring
him
back
to
her
or
perhaps
denbigh
that
was
the
more
immediate
resource
and
surely
no
sacrifice
should
be
too
great
for
a
family
physician
to
make
for
the
welfare
of
his
patients
maria
and
i
would
invite
denbigh
to
dinner
and
have
aunt
elizabeth
as
the
only
other
guest
we
could
leave
them
alone
on
some
pretext
or
other
after
dinner
and
leave
the
rest
to
fate
aided
and
abetted
by
elizabeth
herself
meanwhile
there
was
goward
still
on
my
hands
well
my
boy
i
said
patting
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
you
about
this
thing
you
got
yourself
in
the
dickens
of
a
box
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
think
your
heart
is
in
the
right
place
and
whatever
has
happened
i
do
believe
you
have
intentionally
done
wrong
maybe
at
your
age
you
do
not
realize
that
it
is
not
safe
to
be
engaged
to
two
people
at
the
same
time
especially
when
they
belong
to
the
same
family
scientific
as
a
rule
take
care
that
their
fiancees
are
not
only
not
related
but
live
in
different
sections
of
the
country
and
as
i
have
no
liking
for
preaching
i
shall
not
dwell
further
upon
the
i
think
i
realize
my
position
keenly
enough
without
putting
you
to
the
trouble
said
goward
gazing
gloomily
out
of
the
window
what
i
will
say
however
said
i
is
that
i
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
out
of
your
trouble
as
one
to
another
eh
you
are
very
kind
said
he
gripping
me
by
the
hand
i
will
go
to
talbert
she
is
the
best
one
to
talk
to
first
and
tell
her
just
what
you
have
told
me
and
it
is
just
possible
that
she
can
explain
it
to
peggy
i
went
on
i
i
think
i
could
do
that
myself
if
i
only
had
the
chance
he
said
ruefully
well
then
i
try
to
make
the
chance
i
wo
promise
that
i
will
make
it
because
i
ca
answer
for
anybody
but
myself
some
day
you
will
find
out
that
women
are
peculiar
but
what
i
can
do
i
will
said
i
and
furthermore
as
the
general
attorney
for
the
family
i
will
aunt
elizabeth
put
her
through
the
third
degree
as
it
were
and
try
to
show
her
how
foolish
it
is
for
her
to
make
so
serious
a
matter
of
a
trifling
i
would
if
i
were
you
said
goward
with
a
frown
she
need
be
involved
in
the
affair
any
more
than
she
already
is
she
is
not
in
the
least
to
nevertheless
said
i
she
may
be
able
to
help
us
to
an
easy
way
out
she
ca
said
goward
positively
excuse
me
goward
said
i
chilling
a
trifle
in
my
newly
acquired
friendliness
but
is
there
any
real
reason
why
i
should
not
question
miss
talbert
oh
no
none
at
all
he
hastened
to
reply
only
i
i
see
no
particular
object
in
vexing
her
further
in
a
matter
that
must
have
already
annoyed
her
sufficiently
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
on
my
account
and
i
do
wish
you
to
add
further
to
your
difficulties
either
he
added
i
appreciated
his
consideration
with
certain
reservations
however
the
latter
were
not
of
such
character
as
to
make
me
doubt
the
advisability
of
standing
his
friend
and
when
we
parted
a
few
minutes
later
i
left
him
with
the
intention
of
becoming
his
advocate
with
peggy
and
her
mother
and
at
the
same
time
of
having
it
out
with
aunt
elizabeth
i
was
detained
at
my
office
by
other
matters
which
our
family
troubles
had
caused
me
to
neglect
until
and
then
i
returned
to
my
own
home
expecting
to
have
a
little
chat
over
the
affair
with
maria
before
acquainting
the
rest
of
the
family
with
my
impressions
of
goward
and
his
responsibility
for
our
woe
maria
is
always
so
full
of
good
ideas
but
at
six
she
had
not
come
in
and
at
she
me
that
she
was
at
her
father
and
would
i
not
better
go
there
for
tea
in
the
talbert
family
a
suggestion
of
that
sort
is
the
equivalent
of
a
royal
command
in
great
britain
and
i
at
once
proceeded
to
accept
it
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
however
the
thought
flashed
across
my
mind
that
in
my
sympathy
for
harry
goward
i
had
neglected
to
ask
him
the
question
i
had
sought
him
out
to
ask
to
whom
was
the
letter
addressed
so
i
returned
to
the
and
ringing
up
the
eagle
hotel
inquired
for
goward
mr
goward
came
the
answer
yes
said
i
mr
henry
mr
goward
left
for
new
york
on
the
train
this
afternoon
was
the
reply
the
answer
so
unexpected
and
unsettling
to
all
my
plans
stunned
me
first
and
then
angered
me
bah
i
cried
impatiently
the
little
fool
an
attack
of
cold
feet
i
guess
he
ought
to
spell
his
name
with
a
i
hung
up
the
receiver
with
a
cold
chill
for
frankly
i
hated
to
go
to
the
talberts
with
the
news
moreover
it
would
be
a
humiliating
confession
to
make
that
i
had
forgotten
to
ask
goward
about
the
letter
when
everybody
knew
that
that
was
what
i
had
called
upon
him
for
and
when
i
thought
of
all
the
various
expressions
in
the
very
expressive
talbert
eyes
that
would
fix
themselves
upon
me
as
i
mumbled
out
my
confession
i
would
have
given
much
to
be
well
out
of
it
nevertheless
since
there
was
no
avoiding
the
ordeal
i
resolved
to
face
the
music
and
five
minutes
later
entered
the
at
my
house
with
as
stiff
an
upper
lip
as
i
could
summon
to
my
aid
in
the
brief
time
at
my
disposal
they
were
all
seated
at
the
table
already
supper
is
not
a
movable
feast
in
that
establishment
save
aunt
elizabeth
her
place
was
vacant
sorry
to
be
late
said
i
after
respectfully
saluting
my
but
i
could
help
it
things
turned
up
at
the
last
minute
and
they
had
to
be
attended
to
where
aunt
elizabeth
she
went
to
new
york
said
my
on
the
vii
the
married
son
by
henry
james
it
evidently
a
great
thing
in
life
to
have
got
hold
of
a
convenient
expression
and
a
sign
of
our
inordinate
habit
of
living
by
words
i
have
sometimes
flattered
myself
that
i
live
less
exclusively
by
them
than
the
people
about
me
paying
with
them
paying
with
them
only
as
the
phrase
is
there
i
am
at
it
exactly
again
rather
less
than
my
companions
who
with
the
exception
perhaps
a
little
sometimes
of
poor
mother
succeed
by
their
aid
in
keeping
away
from
every
truth
in
ignoring
every
reality
as
comfortably
as
possible
poor
mother
who
is
worth
all
the
rest
of
us
put
together
and
is
really
worth
two
or
three
of
poor
father
deadly
decent
as
i
admit
poor
father
mainly
to
be
sometimes
meets
me
with
a
look
in
some
connection
suggesting
that
deep
within
she
dimly
understands
and
would
really
understand
a
little
better
if
she
were
afraid
to
for
like
all
of
us
she
lives
surrounded
by
the
black
forest
of
the
facts
of
life
very
much
as
the
people
in
the
heart
of
africa
live
in
their
dense
wilderness
of
nocturnal
terrors
the
mysteries
and
monstrosities
that
make
them
seal
themselves
up
in
the
huts
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
she
quite
exquisite
little
mother
would
often
understand
i
believe
if
she
dared
if
she
knew
how
to
dare
and
the
vague
dumb
interchange
then
taking
place
between
us
and
from
the
silence
of
which
we
have
never
for
an
instant
deviated
represents
perhaps
her
wonder
as
to
whether
i
may
on
some
great
occasion
show
her
how
the
difficulty
is
that
alas
mere
intelligent
useless
wretch
as
i
am
i
never
hitherto
been
sure
of
knowing
how
myself
for
am
i
too
not
as
steeped
in
fears
as
any
of
them
my
fears
mostly
are
different
and
of
different
dangers
also
i
hate
having
them
whereas
they
love
them
and
hug
them
to
their
hearts
but
the
fact
remains
that
save
in
this
private
precinct
of
my
overflow
which
contains
under
a
strong
little
brass
lock
several
bad
words
and
many
good
resolutions
i
have
never
either
said
or
done
a
bold
thing
in
my
life
what
i
seem
always
to
feel
doubtless
cravenly
enough
under
her
almost
pathetic
appeal
has
been
that
it
is
yet
the
occasion
the
really
good
and
right
one
for
breaking
out
than
which
nothing
could
more
resemble
of
course
the
inveterate
argument
of
the
helpless
any
occasion
is
good
enough
for
the
helpful
since
there
never
any
that
has
weak
sides
for
their
own
strength
to
make
up
however
if
there
could
be
conceivably
a
good
one
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
seem
to
see
it
gather
now
and
if
i
write
myself
here
poor
charles
edward
in
all
truth
by
failing
to
take
advantage
of
it
they
have
in
fact
i
should
note
one
superiority
of
courage
to
my
own
this
habit
of
their
so
constantly
casting
up
my
poverty
at
me
poverty
of
character
of
course
i
mean
for
they
do
to
do
them
justice
taunt
me
with
having
made
so
little
they
do
i
admit
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
when
they
perform
that
act
the
proposition
itself
being
that
i
have
the
spirit
of
a
fly
my
point
is
at
any
rate
that
i
designate
them
as
poor
only
in
the
abysmal
confidence
of
these
occult
pages
into
which
i
really
believe
even
my
poor
wife
for
it
universal
has
never
succeeded
in
peeping
it
will
be
a
shock
to
me
if
i
some
day
find
she
has
so
far
adventured
and
this
not
on
account
of
the
curiosity
felt
or
the
liberty
taken
but
on
account
of
her
having
successfully
disguised
it
she
knows
i
keep
an
intermittent
diary
i
confessed
to
her
it
the
way
in
which
i
work
things
in
general
my
feelings
and
impatiences
and
difficulties
off
it
the
way
i
work
off
my
nerves
that
luxury
in
which
poor
charles
edward
natural
narrow
means
narrow
so
far
as
ever
acknowledged
do
permit
him
to
indulge
no
one
for
a
moment
suspects
i
have
any
nerves
and
least
of
all
what
they
themselves
do
to
them
no
one
that
is
but
poor
little
mother
again
who
however
again
in
her
way
all
timorously
and
tenderly
has
never
mentioned
it
any
more
than
she
has
ever
mentioned
her
own
which
she
would
think
quite
indecent
this
is
precisely
one
of
the
things
that
while
it
passes
between
us
as
a
mute
assurance
makes
me
feel
myself
more
than
the
others
verily
her
child
more
even
than
poor
little
peg
at
the
present
strained
juncture
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
above
all
is
that
i
do
care
that
poor
lorraine
since
that
my
wife
inimitable
name
which
i
feel
every
time
i
write
it
i
must
apologize
even
to
myself
for
should
quite
discover
the
moments
at
which
first
and
last
i
worked
her
off
yet
i
made
no
secret
of
my
cultivating
it
as
a
resource
that
helps
me
to
hold
out
this
idea
of
our
holding
out
separately
and
together
having
become
for
us
and
quite
comically
as
i
see
the
very
basis
of
life
what
does
it
mean
and
how
and
why
and
to
what
end
are
we
holding
i
ask
myself
that
even
while
i
feel
how
much
we
achieve
even
by
just
hugging
each
other
over
the
general
intensity
of
it
this
is
what
i
have
in
mind
as
to
our
living
to
that
extent
by
the
vain
phrase
as
to
our
really
from
time
to
time
winding
ourselves
up
by
the
use
of
it
and
winding
each
other
what
should
we
do
if
we
did
hold
out
and
of
what
romantic
dramatic
or
simply
perhaps
quite
prosaic
collapse
would
giving
in
in
contradistinction
consist
for
us
we
have
in
the
least
formulated
that
though
it
perhaps
may
but
be
one
of
the
thousand
things
we
are
afraid
of
at
any
rate
we
do
i
think
ever
so
much
as
ask
ourselves
and
much
less
each
other
we
so
quite
sufficiently
sustained
and
inflamed
by
the
sense
that
we
just
doing
it
and
that
in
the
sublime
effort
our
union
is
our
strength
there
must
be
something
in
it
for
the
more
intense
we
make
the
consciousness
and
have
we
brought
it
to
as
fine
a
point
as
our
frequently
triumphant
partnership
at
bridge
the
more
it
positively
does
support
us
poor
lorraine
does
really
at
all
need
to
understand
in
order
to
believe
she
believes
that
failing
our
exquisite
and
intimate
combined
effort
of
resistance
we
should
be
capable
together
of
something
well
it
in
fact
in
this
beautiful
desperation
that
we
spend
our
days
that
we
face
the
pretty
grim
prospect
of
new
ones
that
we
go
and
come
and
talk
and
pretend
that
we
consort
so
far
as
in
our
hypocrisy
we
do
consort
with
the
rest
of
the
family
that
we
have
sunday
supper
with
the
parents
and
emerge
modestly
yet
virtuously
shining
from
the
ordeal
that
we
put
in
our
daily
appearance
at
the
works
for
a
utility
nowadays
so
vague
that
i
fully
aware
lorraine
is
so
much
of
the
deep
amusement
i
excite
there
though
i
also
recognize
how
wonderfully
how
quite
charitably
they
manage
not
to
break
out
with
it
bless
for
the
most
part
their
dear
simple
hearts
it
is
in
this
privately
exalted
way
that
we
bear
in
short
the
burden
of
our
obloquy
our
failure
our
resignation
our
sacrifice
of
what
we
should
have
liked
even
if
it
be
a
matter
we
scarce
dare
to
so
much
as
name
to
each
other
and
above
all
of
our
insufferable
reputation
for
an
abject
meekness
we
really
not
meek
a
bit
secretly
quite
ferocious
but
we
held
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
not
only
for
our
proved
business
incompetence
but
for
our
lack
of
artistic
power
as
well
it
being
now
definitely
on
record
that
we
never
yet
designed
a
single
type
of
since
the
damnable
form
father
production
more
and
more
runs
to
his
uncanny
ideal
is
to
turn
out
more
than
any
firm
in
the
world
that
has
taken
with
their
awful
public
we
tried
again
and
again
to
strike
off
something
hideous
enough
but
it
has
always
in
these
cases
appeared
to
us
quite
beautiful
compared
to
the
object
finally
turned
out
on
their
improved
lines
for
the
unspeakable
market
so
that
only
been
able
to
be
publicly
rueful
and
depressed
about
it
and
to
plead
practically
in
extenuation
of
all
the
extra
trouble
we
saddle
them
with
that
such
things
are
alas
the
worst
we
can
do
we
so
far
succeed
in
our
plea
that
we
held
at
least
to
sit
as
i
say
in
contrition
and
to
understand
how
little
when
it
comes
to
a
reckoning
we
really
pay
our
way
this
actually
passes
i
think
for
the
main
basis
of
our
humility
as
it
certainly
the
basis
of
what
i
feel
to
be
poor
mother
unuttered
yearning
it
almost
broke
her
heart
that
we
should
have
to
live
in
such
shame
she
has
only
got
so
far
as
that
yet
but
it
a
beginning
and
i
seem
to
make
out
that
if
i
do
spoil
it
by
any
wrong
word
if
i
do
in
fact
break
the
spell
by
any
wrong
breath
she
probably
come
on
further
it
will
glimmer
upon
her
some
day
when
she
looks
at
me
in
her
uncomfortable
bewildered
tenderness
and
i
almost
hypnotize
her
by
just
smiling
inscrutably
back
that
she
getting
all
the
moral
benefit
she
somehow
ought
out
of
my
being
so
pathetically
wrong
and
then
she
begin
to
wonder
and
wonder
all
to
herself
if
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
for
me
she
has
limped
along
in
her
more
or
less
dissimulated
pain
on
this
apparently
firm
ground
that
i
so
wrong
that
nothing
will
do
for
either
of
us
but
a
sweet
solemn
tactful
agreement
between
us
never
to
mention
it
it
falls
in
so
richly
with
all
the
other
things
all
the
real
things
we
never
mention
well
it
doubtless
an
odd
fact
to
be
setting
down
even
here
but
i
shall
be
sorry
for
her
on
the
day
when
her
glimmer
as
i
have
called
it
broadens
when
it
breaks
on
her
that
if
i
as
wrong
as
this
comes
to
why
the
others
must
be
actively
and
absolutely
right
she
has
never
had
to
take
it
quite
that
way
so
women
even
mothers
wondrously
get
on
and
heaven
help
her
as
i
say
when
she
shall
she
be
immense
tactfully
immense
with
father
about
it
she
manage
that
for
herself
and
for
him
all
right
but
where
the
iron
will
enter
into
her
will
be
at
the
thought
of
her
having
for
so
long
given
raison
as
they
say
in
paris
or
as
poor
lorraine
at
least
says
they
say
to
a
couple
like
maria
and
tom
price
it
comes
over
her
that
she
has
taken
it
largely
from
them
and
she
has
that
we
living
in
immorality
lorraine
and
i
ah
then
poor
dear
little
mother
upon
my
word
i
believe
i
go
on
lying
low
to
this
positive
pitch
of
grovelling
and
lorraine
charming
absurd
creature
would
back
me
up
in
it
too
in
order
precisely
to
save
mother
such
a
revulsion
it
will
be
really
more
trouble
than
it
will
be
worth
to
her
since
it
is
as
if
our
relation
were
of
its
kind
just
as
we
are
about
as
dear
as
it
can
be
i
literally
much
rather
help
her
not
to
see
than
to
see
i
much
rather
help
her
to
get
on
with
the
others
yes
even
including
poor
father
the
fine
damp
plaster
of
whose
composition
renewed
from
week
to
week
ca
be
touched
anywhere
without
letting
your
finger
in
without
peril
of
its
coming
to
pieces
in
the
way
easiest
for
her
if
not
easiest
to
her
she
could
live
with
the
others
an
hour
no
not
with
one
of
them
unless
with
poor
little
peg
save
by
accepting
all
their
premises
save
by
making
in
other
words
all
the
concessions
and
having
all
the
imagination
i
ask
from
her
nothing
of
this
i
do
the
whole
thing
with
her
as
she
has
to
do
it
with
them
and
of
this
au
fond
as
lorraine
again
says
she
is
ever
so
subtly
aware
just
as
for
it
ever
so
dumbly
grateful
let
these
notes
stand
at
any
rate
for
my
fond
fancy
of
that
and
write
it
here
to
my
credit
in
letters
as
big
and
black
as
the
tearful
alphabet
of
my
childhood
let
them
do
this
even
if
everything
else
registers
meaner
things
i
perfectly
willing
to
recognize
as
grovellingly
as
any
one
likes
that
as
and
as
married
and
as
preoccupied
and
as
disillusioned
or
at
least
as
battered
and
seasoned
by
adversity
as
possible
i
in
respect
to
her
as
achingly
filial
and
as
feelingly
dependent
all
the
time
as
when
i
used
in
the
years
to
wake
up
a
small
blubbering
idiot
from
frightening
dreams
and
refuse
to
go
to
sleep
again
in
the
dark
till
i
clutched
her
hands
or
her
dress
and
felt
her
bend
over
me
she
used
to
protect
me
then
from
domestic
derision
for
she
somehow
kept
such
passages
quiet
but
she
ca
it
where
her
ache
comes
in
protect
me
now
from
a
more
insidious
kind
well
now
i
do
care
i
feel
it
in
maria
and
tom
constantly
who
offer
themselves
as
the
pattern
of
success
in
comparison
with
which
poor
lorraine
and
i
are
nowhere
i
do
say
they
do
it
with
malice
prepense
or
that
they
plot
against
us
to
our
ruin
the
thing
operates
rather
as
an
extraordinary
effect
of
their
mere
successful
blatancy
they
blatant
truly
in
the
superlative
degree
and
i
call
them
successfully
so
for
just
this
reason
that
poor
mother
is
to
all
appearance
perfectly
unaware
of
it
maria
is
the
one
member
of
all
her
circle
that
has
got
her
really
not
only
just
ostensibly
into
training
and
it
a
part
of
the
general
irony
of
fate
that
neither
she
nor
my
terrible
sister
herself
recognizes
the
truth
of
this
the
others
even
to
poor
father
think
they
manage
and
manipulate
her
and
she
can
afford
to
let
them
think
it
ridiculously
since
they
do
come
anywhere
near
it
she
knows
they
do
and
is
easy
with
them
playing
over
father
in
especial
with
so
lightly
resting
and
yet
so
effectively
tickling
that
he
has
never
known
at
a
given
moment
either
where
they
were
or
in
the
least
what
they
were
doing
to
him
that
enough
for
mother
who
keeps
by
it
the
freedom
other
soul
yet
whose
fundamental
humility
comes
out
in
its
being
so
hidden
from
her
that
her
eldest
daughter
to
whom
she
allows
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
does
damnably
boss
her
this
is
the
one
case
in
which
she
not
lucid
and
to
make
it
perfect
maria
whose
humility
is
neither
fundamental
nor
superficial
but
whose
avidity
is
both
comfortably
cherishes
as
a
ground
of
complaint
nurses
in
fact
beatifically
as
a
wrong
the
belief
that
she
the
one
person
without
influence
influence
why
she
has
so
much
on
me
that
she
absolutely
coerces
me
into
making
here
these
dark
and
dreadful
remarks
about
her
let
my
record
establish
in
this
fashion
that
if
a
clinging
son
i
in
that
quarter
to
make
up
for
it
a
detached
brother
deadly
virtuous
and
deadly
hard
and
deadly
charmless
also
more
than
anything
deadly
sure
i
how
does
maria
fit
on
by
consanguinity
to
such
amiable
characters
such
real
social
values
as
mother
and
me
at
all
if
that
question
ceases
to
matter
sometimes
during
the
week
it
flares
up
on
the
other
hand
at
sunday
supper
down
the
street
where
tom
and
his
wife
overwhelmingly
cheerful
and
facetious
contrast
so
favorably
with
poor
gentle
sickly
as
we
doubtless
appear
lorraine
and
me
we
ca
meet
them
that
is
i
meet
tom
on
that
ground
the
furious
to
which
he
reduces
conversation
making
it
echo
as
with
the
roar
of
the
arena
one
little
bit
of
course
with
such
deep
diversity
of
feeling
we
simply
loathe
each
other
he
and
i
but
the
sad
thing
is
that
we
get
no
good
of
it
none
of
the
true
joy
of
life
the
joy
of
our
passions
and
perceptions
and
desires
by
reason
of
our
awful
predetermined
geniality
and
the
strange
abysmal
necessity
of
our
having
so
eternally
to
put
up
with
each
other
if
we
could
intermit
that
vain
superstition
somehow
for
about
three
minutes
i
often
think
the
air
might
clear
as
by
the
scramble
of
the
game
of
general
post
or
whatever
they
call
it
and
we
should
all
get
out
of
our
wrong
corners
and
find
ourselves
in
our
right
glaring
from
these
positions
a
happy
and
natural
defiance
then
i
should
be
thus
nominally
and
pretendedly
it
too
ignoble
on
the
same
side
or
in
the
same
air
as
my
whose
value
is
that
he
has
thirty
business
ideas
a
day
while
i
shall
never
have
had
the
thirtieth
fraction
of
one
in
my
whole
life
he
just
hums
tom
price
with
business
ideas
whereas
i
just
gape
with
the
impossibility
of
them
he
moves
in
the
densest
we
carry
our
heads
here
on
august
evenings
each
with
its
own
thick
nimbus
of
mosquitoes
i
but
too
conscious
of
how
on
the
other
hand
i
desolately
outlined
to
all
eyes
in
an
air
as
pure
and
empty
as
that
of
a
fine
polar
sunset
it
was
lorraine
dear
quaint
thing
who
some
time
ago
made
the
remark
on
our
leaving
one
of
those
weekly
banquets
at
which
we
figure
positively
as
a
pair
of
social
skeletons
that
tom
facetae
multiply
evidently
in
direct
proportion
to
his
wealth
of
business
ideas
so
that
whenever
he
enormously
funny
we
may
take
it
that
he
on
something
tremendous
he
sprightly
in
proportion
as
he
in
earnest
and
innocent
in
proportion
as
he
going
to
be
dangerous
dangerous
i
mean
to
the
competitor
and
the
victim
indeed
when
i
reflect
that
his
jokes
are
probably
each
going
to
cost
certain
people
wretched
helpless
people
like
myself
hundreds
and
thousands
of
dollars
their
abundant
flow
affects
me
as
one
of
the
most
lurid
of
exhibitions
i
sometimes
rather
wondered
that
father
can
stand
so
much
of
him
father
who
has
after
all
a
sharp
nerve
or
two
in
him
like
a
razor
gone
astray
in
a
valise
of
thick
jager
underclothing
though
of
course
maria
pulling
with
tom
shoulder
to
shoulder
would
like
to
see
any
one
not
stand
her
husband
the
explanation
has
struck
me
as
mostly
that
business
genial
and
cheerful
and
even
obstreperous
without
detriment
to
its
being
business
has
been
poor
father
ideal
for
his
own
terrible
kind
this
ideal
is
further
that
his
shall
attest
that
prosperity
i
think
it
has
even
been
his
conception
that
our
family
tone
shall
by
its
sweet
innocence
fairly
register
the
pace
at
which
the
works
keep
ahead
so
that
he
has
the
pleasure
of
feeling
us
as
funny
and
slangy
here
as
people
can
only
be
who
have
had
the
best
of
the
bargains
other
people
are
having
occasion
to
rue
we
of
course
do
know
that
is
mother
and
grandmamma
do
in
any
definite
way
any
more
than
i
do
thanks
to
my
careful
stupidity
how
exceeding
small
some
of
the
material
is
consciously
ground
in
the
great
grim
thrifty
mill
of
industrial
success
and
indeed
we
grow
about
as
many
cheap
illusions
and
easy
comforts
in
the
faintly
fenced
garden
of
our
little
life
as
could
very
well
be
crammed
into
the
space
poor
grandmamma
since
i
mentioned
her
appears
to
me
always
the
aged
wan
flora
of
our
paradise
the
presiding
divinity
seated
in
the
centre
under
whose
pious
traditions
really
quite
dim
and
outlived
our
fond
sacrifices
are
offered
queer
enough
the
superstition
that
granny
is
a
very
solid
and
strenuous
and
rather
grim
person
with
a
capacity
for
facing
the
world
that
we
a
relaxed
generation
have
weakly
lost
she
knows
as
much
about
the
world
as
a
tin
knows
about
the
dinner
and
is
the
oddest
mixture
of
brooding
anxieties
over
things
that
do
in
the
least
matter
and
of
bland
failure
to
suspect
things
that
intensely
do
she
lives
in
short
in
a
weird
little
waste
of
words
over
the
moral
earnestness
we
none
of
us
cultivate
yet
has
a
notion
of
any
effective
earnestness
herself
except
on
the
subject
of
empty
bottles
which
have
it
would
appear
noble
neglected
uses
at
this
time
of
day
it
does
matter
but
if
there
could
have
been
dropped
into
her
empty
bottles
at
an
earlier
stage
something
to
strengthen
a
little
any
wine
of
life
they
were
likely
to
contain
she
would
have
figured
so
as
the
head
and
front
of
all
our
sentimentality
i
judge
it
for
that
matter
a
proof
of
our
flat
modernity
in
this
order
that
the
scant
starch
holding
her
together
is
felt
to
give
her
among
us
this
antique
and
austere
consistency
i
do
talk
things
over
with
lorraine
for
nothing
and
she
does
keep
for
me
the
flashes
of
perception
we
neither
of
us
waste
on
the
others
it
the
antiquity
of
the
age
of
crinoline
she
said
the
other
day
a
propos
of
a
little
photograph
of
my
ancestress
as
a
young
woman
of
the
time
of
the
war
looking
as
if
she
had
been
violently
inflated
from
below
but
had
succeeded
in
resisting
at
any
cost
and
with
a
strange
intensity
of
expression
from
her
waist
up
mother
however
i
must
say
is
as
wonderful
about
her
as
about
everything
else
and
arranges
herself
exactly
to
appear
a
mere
contemporary
illustration
being
all
the
while
three
times
the
true
picture
in
order
that
her
parent
shall
have
the
importance
of
the
family
portrait
i
do
mean
of
course
that
she
has
told
me
so
but
she
can
not
see
that
if
she
has
that
importance
granny
has
none
other
and
it
therefore
as
if
she
pretended
she
had
a
ruff
a
stomacher
a
farthingale
and
all
the
rest
grand
old
angles
and
eccentricities
and
fine
absurdities
the
hard
white
face
if
necessary
of
one
who
has
seen
witches
burned
she
has
any
more
than
any
one
else
among
us
a
gleam
of
fine
absurdity
that
a
product
that
seems
unable
for
the
life
of
it
and
though
so
indispensable
say
for
literary
material
to
grow
here
but
exquisitely
determined
she
shall
have
character
lest
she
perish
while
it
assumed
we
still
need
her
mother
makes
it
up
for
her
with
a
turn
of
the
hand
out
of
bits
left
over
from
her
own
far
from
economically
as
her
own
was
originally
planned
scraps
of
spiritual
silk
and
velvet
that
no
one
takes
notice
of
missing
and
granny
as
in
the
dignity
of
her
legend
imposes
ridiculous
old
woman
on
every
one
granny
passes
for
one
of
the
finest
old
figures
in
the
place
while
mother
is
never
discovered
so
is
history
always
written
and
so
is
truth
mostly
worshipped
there
indeed
one
thing
i
do
her
the
justice
to
say
as
to
which
she
has
a
glimmer
of
vision
as
to
which
she
had
it
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
was
thoroughly
with
her
in
her
deprecation
of
the
idea
that
peggy
should
be
sent
to
crown
her
culture
to
that
horrid
college
from
which
the
poor
child
returned
the
other
day
so
preposterously
engaged
to
be
married
and
if
she
had
only
been
a
little
more
actively
with
me
we
might
perhaps
between
us
have
done
something
about
it
but
she
has
a
way
of
deprecating
with
her
long
knobby
mittened
hand
over
her
mouth
and
of
looking
at
the
same
time
in
a
mysterious
manner
down
into
one
of
the
angles
of
the
room
it
reduces
her
protest
to
a
feebleness
she
incapable
of
seeing
in
it
herself
more
than
a
fraction
of
what
it
has
for
her
and
really
thinks
it
would
be
wicked
and
abandoned
would
savor
of
criticism
which
is
the
cardinal
sin
with
her
to
see
all
or
to
follow
any
premise
to
it
in
the
right
direction
still
there
was
the
happy
chance
at
the
time
the
question
came
up
that
she
had
retained
on
the
subject
of
promiscuous
colleges
the
mistrust
of
the
age
of
crinoline
as
to
which
in
fact
that
little
old
photograph
with
its
balloon
petticoat
and
its
astonishingly
flat
stiff
torso
might
have
imaged
some
failure
of
the
attempt
to
blow
the
heresy
into
her
the
true
inwardness
of
the
history
at
the
crisis
was
that
our
fell
maria
had
made
up
her
mind
that
peg
should
go
and
that
as
i
have
noted
the
thing
our
fell
maria
makes
up
her
mind
to
among
us
is
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
thing
that
is
done
maria
still
takes
in
spite
of
her
partial
removal
to
a
wider
sphere
the
most
insidious
interest
in
us
and
the
beauty
of
her
affectionate
concern
for
the
welfare
of
her
younger
sisters
is
the
theme
of
every
tongue
she
observed
to
lorraine
in
a
moment
of
rare
expansion
more
than
a
year
ago
that
she
had
got
their
two
futures
perfectly
fixed
and
that
as
peggy
appeared
to
have
some
mind
though
how
much
she
was
yet
sure
it
should
be
developed
what
there
was
of
it
on
the
highest
modern
lines
peggy
would
never
be
thought
generally
that
is
physically
attractive
anyway
she
would
see
about
alice
the
brat
later
on
though
meantime
she
had
her
idea
the
idea
that
alice
was
really
going
to
have
the
looks
and
would
at
a
given
moment
break
out
into
beauty
in
which
event
she
should
be
run
for
that
and
for
all
it
might
be
worth
and
she
maria
would
be
ready
to
take
the
contract
this
is
the
kind
of
patronage
of
us
that
passes
i
believe
among
her
more
particular
intimates
for
so
sweet
of
her
it
being
of
course
maria
all
over
to
think
herself
subtle
for
just
reversing
with
a
there
see
how
original
i
am
any
benighted
conviction
usually
entertained
i
do
know
that
any
one
has
ever
thought
alice
the
brat
intellectual
but
certainly
no
one
has
ever
judged
her
even
potentially
handsome
in
the
light
of
no
matter
which
of
those
staggering
that
suddenly
produce
features
in
flat
faces
and
figure
in
the
void
of
space
as
a
conjurer
pulls
rabbits
out
of
a
sheet
of
paper
and
yards
of
ribbon
out
of
nothing
moreover
if
any
one
should
know
lorraine
and
i
with
our
trained
sense
for
form
and
for
values
certainly
would
however
it
does
matter
the
whole
thing
being
but
a
bit
of
maria
system
of
bluffing
in
order
to
boss
peggy
has
more
than
the
brain
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
her
of
a
small
swelling
dove
on
a
but
she
extremely
pretty
and
absolutely
nice
a
little
rounded
presence
that
pecks
up
gratefully
any
grain
of
appreciation
i
said
to
mother
i
remember
at
the
time
i
took
that
plunge
i
hope
to
goodness
you
not
going
to
pitch
that
defenceless
child
into
any
such
bear
garden
and
she
replied
that
to
make
a
you
first
had
to
have
bears
and
she
did
suppose
the
young
men
could
be
so
described
well
then
said
i
would
you
rather
i
should
call
them
donkeys
or
even
monkeys
what
i
mean
is
that
the
poor
girl
a
perfect
little
decorative
person
who
ought
to
have
plumage
and
feet
to
match
the
rest
of
her
should
be
thrust
into
any
general
but
be
kept
for
the
dovecote
and
the
garden
kept
where
we
may
still
hear
her
coo
that
what
at
college
they
make
her
unlearn
she
learn
to
roar
and
snarl
with
the
other
animals
think
of
the
vocal
sounds
with
which
she
may
come
back
to
us
mother
appeared
to
think
but
asked
me
after
a
moment
as
a
result
of
it
in
which
of
the
cages
of
the
new
york
art
league
menagerie
and
among
what
sort
of
sounds
i
had
found
lorraine
who
was
a
product
of
if
there
ever
had
been
one
just
as
our
marriage
itself
had
been
such
a
product
i
replied
to
this
well
what
i
could
easily
reply
but
i
asked
i
recollect
in
the
very
forefront
if
she
were
sending
peg
to
college
to
get
married
she
declared
it
was
the
last
thing
she
was
in
a
hurry
about
and
that
she
believed
there
was
no
danger
but
her
great
argument
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
maria
feels
the
want
of
it
of
a
college
education
she
feels
it
would
have
given
her
more
confidence
and
i
shall
in
fact
never
forget
the
little
look
of
strange
supplication
that
she
gave
me
with
these
words
what
it
meant
was
now
do
ask
me
to
go
into
the
question
for
the
moment
any
further
it
in
the
acute
stage
and
you
know
how
soon
maria
can
bring
a
question
to
a
head
she
has
settled
it
with
your
father
in
other
words
has
settled
it
for
him
settled
it
in
the
sense
that
we
did
give
her
at
the
right
time
the
advantage
she
ought
to
have
had
it
would
have
given
her
confidence
from
the
want
of
which
acquired
at
that
age
she
feels
she
so
suffers
and
your
father
thinks
it
fine
of
her
to
urge
that
her
little
sister
shall
profit
by
her
warning
nothing
works
on
him
you
know
so
much
as
to
hear
it
hinted
that
we
failed
of
our
duty
to
any
of
you
and
you
can
see
how
it
must
work
when
he
can
be
persuaded
that
maria
has
colossal
cheek
i
took
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
with
such
colossal
cheek
what
need
have
you
of
confidence
which
is
such
an
inferior
form
the
long
and
short
was
of
course
that
peggy
went
believing
on
her
side
poor
dear
that
it
might
for
future
relations
give
her
the
pull
of
maria
this
represents
really
i
think
the
one
spark
of
guile
in
peggy
breast
the
smart
of
a
small
grievance
suffered
at
her
hands
in
the
dim
maria
slapped
her
face
or
ate
up
her
chocolates
or
smeared
her
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
sound
of
the
slap
still
reverberates
in
peg
consciousness
the
missed
sweetness
still
haunts
her
palate
the
smutch
of
the
fair
page
peg
writes
an
immaculate
little
hand
and
maria
a
wretched
one
the
only
thing
she
ca
swagger
about
still
affronts
her
sight
maria
also
to
do
her
justice
has
a
vague
hankering
under
which
she
has
always
been
restive
to
make
up
for
the
outrage
and
the
form
the
compunction
now
takes
is
to
get
her
away
it
one
of
the
facts
of
our
situation
all
round
i
may
thus
add
that
every
one
wants
to
get
some
one
else
away
and
that
there
are
indeed
one
or
two
of
us
upon
whom
to
that
end
could
the
conspiracy
only
be
occult
enough
which
it
can
never
all
the
rest
would
effectively
concentrate
father
would
like
to
shunt
granny
it
is
monstrous
his
having
his
a
fixture
under
his
roof
though
after
all
i
not
sure
this
patience
does
rank
for
him
as
one
of
those
domestic
genialities
that
allow
his
conscience
a
bolder
and
tighter
business
hand
a
curious
service
this
sort
of
thing
i
note
rendered
to
the
business
conscience
throughout
our
community
mother
at
any
rate
and
small
blame
to
her
would
like
to
shoo
off
eliza
as
lorraine
and
i
in
our
deepest
privacy
call
aunt
elizabeth
the
tom
prices
would
like
to
extirpate
us
of
course
we
would
give
our
most
immediate
jewel
to
clear
the
sky
of
the
tom
prices
und
so
weiter
and
i
think
we
should
really
all
band
together
for
once
in
our
lives
in
an
unnatural
alliance
to
get
rid
of
eliza
the
beauty
as
to
this
is
moreover
that
i
make
out
the
rich
if
dim
dawn
of
that
possibility
which
i
been
secretly
invoking
all
this
year
for
poor
mother
sake
and
as
the
act
of
mine
own
right
hand
moreover
without
other
human
help
but
of
that
anon
the
immediately
striking
thing
being
meanwhile
again
the
strange
stultification
of
the
passions
in
us
which
prevents
anything
ever
from
coming
to
an
admitted
and
avowed
head
maria
can
be
trusted
as
i
have
said
to
bring
on
the
small
crisis
every
time
but
she
as
afraid
as
any
one
else
of
the
great
one
and
she
moreover
i
write
it
with
rapture
afraid
of
eliza
eliza
is
the
one
person
in
our
whole
community
she
does
fear
and
for
reasons
i
perfectly
grasp
to
which
moreover
this
extraordinary
oddity
attaches
that
i
positively
feel
i
do
fear
eliza
in
the
least
and
in
fact
promise
myself
before
long
to
show
it
and
yet
do
at
all
avail
by
that
show
of
my
indifference
to
danger
to
inspire
my
sister
with
the
least
terror
in
respect
to
myself
it
very
funny
the
degree
of
her
dread
of
eliza
who
affects
her
evidently
as
a
person
of
lurid
worldly
possibilities
the
one
innocent
light
in
which
poor
maria
wears
for
me
what
lorraine
calls
a
weird
pathos
and
perhaps
after
all
on
the
day
i
shall
have
justified
my
futile
passage
across
this
agitated
scene
and
my
questionable
utility
here
below
every
way
by
converting
our
aunt
lively
presence
into
a
lively
absence
it
may
come
over
her
that
i
am
to
be
recognized
i
in
fact
dream
at
times
with
high
intensity
that
i
see
the
prices
some
day
quite
turn
pale
as
they
look
at
each
other
and
find
themselves
taking
me
in
i
made
up
my
mind
at
any
rate
that
poor
mother
shall
within
the
year
be
relieved
in
one
way
or
another
of
her
constant
liability
to
her
visitations
it
is
to
be
endured
that
her
house
should
be
so
little
her
own
house
as
i
known
granny
and
eliza
between
them
though
after
a
different
fashion
succeed
in
making
it
appear
and
yet
the
action
to
take
will
i
perfectly
see
never
by
any
possibility
come
from
poor
father
he
accepts
his
sister
perpetual
under
the
law
of
her
own
convenience
with
a
serenity
which
i
find
distinctly
irritating
if
i
may
use
the
impious
expression
and
which
makes
me
ask
myself
how
he
sees
poor
position
at
all
the
truth
is
poor
father
never
does
see
anything
of
that
sort
in
the
sense
of
conceiving
it
in
its
relations
he
know
i
guess
but
what
the
prowling
eliza
has
a
position
since
this
is
a
superstition
that
i
observe
even
my
acute
little
lorraine
ca
quite
shake
off
he
takes
refuge
about
it
as
about
everything
truly
in
the
cheerful
vagueness
of
that
general
consciousness
on
which
i
have
already
touched
he
likes
to
come
home
from
the
works
every
day
to
see
how
good
he
really
is
after
all
and
it
what
poor
mother
thus
has
to
demonstrate
for
him
by
translating
his
benevolence
translating
it
to
himself
and
to
others
into
if
he
were
only
good
to
her
he
might
be
good
enough
but
the
more
we
pig
together
round
about
him
the
more
blandly
patriarchal
we
make
him
feel
eliza
meanwhile
at
any
rate
is
spoiling
for
a
dose
if
ever
a
woman
required
one
and
i
seem
already
to
feel
in
the
air
the
gathering
elements
of
the
occasion
that
awaits
me
for
administering
it
all
of
which
it
is
a
comfort
somehow
to
maunder
away
on
here
as
i
read
over
what
i
have
written
the
aspects
of
our
situation
multiply
so
in
fact
that
i
note
again
how
one
has
only
to
look
at
any
human
thing
very
straight
that
is
with
the
minimum
of
intelligence
to
see
it
shine
out
in
as
many
aspects
as
the
hues
of
the
prism
or
place
itself
in
other
words
in
relations
that
positively
stop
nowhere
i
often
thought
i
should
like
some
day
to
write
a
novel
but
what
would
become
of
me
in
that
case
delivered
over
i
mean
before
my
subject
to
my
extravagant
sense
that
everything
is
a
part
of
something
else
when
you
paint
a
picture
with
a
brush
and
pigments
that
is
on
a
single
plane
it
can
stop
at
your
gilt
frame
but
when
you
paint
one
with
a
pen
and
words
that
is
in
all
the
dimensions
how
are
you
to
stop
of
course
as
lorraine
says
stopping
that
art
and
what
are
we
artists
like
my
dear
but
those
drivers
of
in
new
york
who
by
some
divine
instinct
recognize
in
the
forest
of
pillars
and
posts
the
columns
at
which
they
may
pull
up
yes
we
drivers
of
charged
with
electric
force
and
prepared
to
go
any
distance
from
which
the
consideration
of
a
probable
smash
ahead
does
deter
that
consideration
deters
me
doubtless
even
a
little
here
in
spite
of
my
seeing
the
track
to
the
next
bend
so
temptingly
clear
i
should
like
to
note
for
instance
for
my
own
satisfaction
though
no
fellow
thank
god
was
ever
less
a
prey
to
the
ignoble
fear
of
inconsistency
that
poor
mother
impugnment
of
my
acquisition
of
lorraine
did
in
the
least
disconcert
me
i
did
pick
lorraine
then
a
little
bleating
stray
lamb
collared
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
a
tinkling
silver
bell
out
of
our
new
york
but
it
interests
me
awfully
to
recognize
that
whereas
the
kind
of
association
is
one
i
hate
for
my
small
philistine
sister
who
probably
has
the
makings
of
a
nice
dull
dressed
amiable
insignificant
woman
i
recognize
it
perfectly
as
lorraine
native
element
and
my
own
or
at
least
do
at
all
mind
her
having
been
dipped
in
it
it
has
tempered
and
plated
us
for
the
rest
of
life
and
to
an
effect
different
enough
from
the
awful
metallic
wash
of
our
company
admired
we
artists
are
at
the
best
children
of
despair
a
certain
divine
despair
as
lorraine
naturally
says
and
what
jollier
place
for
laying
it
in
abundantly
than
the
art
league
as
for
peg
however
i
wo
hear
of
her
having
anything
to
do
with
this
she
shall
despair
of
nothing
worse
than
the
hang
of
her
skirt
or
the
moderation
other
hat
and
not
often
if
i
can
help
her
even
of
those
that
small
vow
i
glad
to
register
here
it
helps
somehow
at
the
juncture
i
seem
to
feel
rapidly
approaching
to
do
the
indispensable
thing
lorraine
is
always
talking
about
to
define
my
position
always
insisting
that
we
never
sufficiently
defined
it
as
if
ever
for
a
moment
pretended
we
have
we
refined
it
to
the
last
intensity
and
of
course
now
shall
have
to
do
so
still
more
which
will
leave
them
all
even
more
bewildered
than
the
boldest
definition
would
have
done
but
that
quite
a
different
thing
the
furthest
we
have
gone
in
the
way
of
definition
unless
indeed
this
too
belongs
but
to
our
invincible
tendency
to
refine
is
by
the
happy
rule
we
made
that
lorraine
shall
walk
with
me
every
morning
to
the
works
and
i
shall
find
her
there
when
i
come
out
to
walk
home
with
me
i
see
on
reading
over
that
this
is
what
i
meant
by
our
in
speaking
above
of
our
little
daily
heroism
in
that
direction
the
heroism
is
easier
and
becomes
quite
sweet
i
find
when
she
comes
so
far
on
the
way
with
me
and
when
we
linger
outside
for
a
little
more
last
talk
before
i
go
in
it
the
drollest
thing
in
the
world
and
really
the
most
precious
note
of
the
mystic
influence
known
in
the
place
as
the
force
of
public
opinion
which
is
in
other
words
but
the
incubus
of
small
domestic
conformity
i
really
believe
there
nothing
we
do
or
do
do
that
excites
in
the
bosom
of
our
circle
a
subtler
sense
that
we
au
fond
uncanny
and
it
amusing
to
think
that
this
is
our
sole
tiny
touch
of
independence
that
she
should
come
forth
with
me
at
those
hours
that
she
should
hang
about
with
me
and
that
we
should
have
last
and
when
she
meets
me
again
first
small
sweet
things
to
say
to
each
other
as
if
we
were
figures
in
a
chromo
or
a
tableau
vwant
keeping
our
tryst
at
a
stile
no
this
quite
inexplicably
transcends
their
scheme
and
baffles
their
imagination
they
ca
conceive
how
or
why
lorraine
gets
out
or
should
wish
to
at
such
hours
there
a
feeling
that
she
must
violate
every
domestic
duty
to
do
it
yes
at
bottom
really
the
act
wears
for
them
i
discern
an
insidious
immorality
and
it
would
take
much
to
bring
public
opinion
down
on
us
in
some
scandalized
way
the
funniest
thing
of
all
moreover
is
that
that
effect
resides
largely
in
our
being
husband
and
wife
it
would
be
absent
wholly
if
we
were
engaged
or
lovers
a
publicly
parading
gentleman
friend
and
lady
friend
what
is
it
we
can
have
to
say
to
each
other
in
that
exclusive
manner
so
particularly
so
frequently
so
flagrantly
and
as
if
we
chances
enough
at
home
i
see
it
a
thing
mother
might
accidentally
do
with
father
or
maria
with
tom
price
but
i
can
imagine
the
shouts
of
hilarity
the
resounding
public
comedy
with
which
tom
and
maria
would
separate
and
also
how
scantly
poor
little
mother
would
permit
herself
with
poor
big
father
any
appearance
of
a
grave
i
quite
expected
her
yes
literally
poor
little
mother
herself
to
ask
me
a
bit
anxiously
any
time
these
six
months
what
it
is
that
at
such
extraordinary
moments
passes
between
us
so
much
at
any
rate
for
the
truth
of
this
cluster
of
documentary
impressions
to
which
there
may
some
day
attach
the
value
as
of
a
direct
contemporary
record
of
strange
and
remote
things
so
much
i
here
and
verily
with
regret
as
well
on
behalf
of
my
picture
for
two
or
three
other
touches
from
which
i
must
forbear
there
has
lately
turned
up
on
our
scene
one
person
with
whom
doors
and
windows
closed
curtains
drawn
secrecy
sworn
the
whole
town
asleep
and
something
there
has
recently
joined
us
one
person
i
say
with
whom
we
might
really
pass
the
time
of
day
to
whom
we
might
after
due
deliberation
tip
the
wink
i
allude
to
the
new
neighbor
the
odd
fellow
temple
who
for
reasons
mysterious
and
which
his
ostensible
undertaking
of
the
native
newspaper
do
at
all
make
plausible
has
elected
as
they
say
fondly
to
sojourn
among
us
a
journalist
a
rolling
stone
a
man
who
has
seen
other
life
how
can
one
not
suspect
him
of
some
deeper
game
than
he
avows
some
such
studious
surreptitious
sociological
intent
as
alone
it
would
seem
could
sustain
him
through
the
practice
of
leaning
on
his
fence
at
eventide
to
converse
for
long
periods
with
poor
father
poor
father
indeed
if
a
real
remorseless
sociologist
were
once
to
get
well
hold
of
him
lorraine
freely
maintains
that
there
more
in
the
temples
than
meets
the
eye
that
they
up
to
something
at
least
that
he
is
that
he
kind
of
feels
us
in
the
air
just
as
we
feel
him
and
that
he
would
sort
of
reach
out
to
us
by
the
same
token
if
we
would
in
any
way
give
the
first
sign
this
however
lorraine
contends
his
wife
wo
let
him
do
his
wife
according
to
mine
is
quite
a
different
proposition
much
more
really
hatted
and
gloved
she
notes
than
any
one
here
even
than
the
belted
and
trinketed
eliza
and
with
a
conviction
of
her
own
as
to
what
their
stay
is
going
to
amount
to
on
the
basis
of
lorraine
similar
conviction
about
ours
it
would
seem
then
that
we
ought
to
meet
for
an
esoteric
revel
yet
somehow
it
does
come
off
sometimes
i
think
quite
wrong
and
that
he
ca
really
be
a
child
of
light
we
should
in
this
case
either
have
seen
him
collapse
or
have
discovered
what
inwardly
sustains
him
we
are
ourselves
inwardly
collapsing
there
no
doubt
of
that
in
spite
of
the
central
fires
as
lorraine
says
somebody
in
boston
used
to
say
somebody
said
from
which
we
fed
from
what
central
fires
is
temple
nourished
i
give
it
up
for
on
the
point
again
and
again
of
desperately
stopping
him
in
the
street
to
ask
him
i
recoil
as
often
in
terror
he
may
be
only
plotting
to
make
me
do
it
so
that
he
may
give
me
away
in
his
paper
remember
he
a
mere
little
frisking
prize
ass
stick
to
that
cling
to
it
make
it
your
answer
to
everything
it
all
you
now
know
and
all
you
need
to
know
and
you
be
as
firm
on
it
as
on
a
rock
this
is
what
i
said
to
poor
peg
on
the
subject
of
harry
goward
before
i
started
in
the
glorious
impulse
of
the
moment
five
nights
ago
for
new
york
and
with
no
moment
now
to
spare
yet
wishing
not
to
lose
my
small
silver
clue
i
just
put
it
here
for
one
of
the
white
pebbles
or
whatever
they
were
that
hop
o
my
thumb
carried
off
to
the
forest
dropped
as
he
went
to
know
his
way
back
i
was
carried
off
the
other
evening
in
a
whirlwind
which
has
not
even
yet
quite
gone
down
though
i
am
now
at
home
and
recovering
my
breath
and
it
will
interest
me
vividly
when
i
have
more
freedom
of
mind
to
live
over
again
these
strange
these
wild
successions
but
a
few
rude
notes
and
only
of
the
first
few
hours
of
my
adventure
must
for
the
present
suffice
the
mot
of
the
whole
thing
as
lorraine
calls
it
was
that
at
last
in
a
flash
we
recognized
what
we
had
so
long
been
wondering
about
what
supreme
advantage
we
been
all
this
latter
time
in
particular
holding
out
for
lorraine
had
put
it
once
again
in
her
happy
way
only
a
few
weeks
previous
we
were
saving
up
she
said
and
not
meaning
at
all
our
poor
scant
dollars
and
cents
though
we
also
kept
hold
of
some
of
them
for
an
exercise
of
strength
and
a
show
of
character
that
would
make
us
of
a
sudden
some
unmistakable
sign
we
should
just
meet
it
rounding
a
corner
as
with
the
rush
of
an
automobile
a
chariot
of
fire
that
would
stop
but
long
enough
to
take
us
in
when
we
should
know
it
immediately
for
the
vehicle
of
our
fate
that
conviction
had
somehow
been
with
us
and
i
had
really
heard
our
hour
begin
to
strike
on
coming
back
to
us
from
her
adventure
so
preposterously
i
did
believe
in
it
in
such
a
manner
of
becoming
so
one
little
bit
and
i
took
on
myself
to
hate
the
same
though
that
indeed
seemed
the
last
thing
to
trouble
any
one
else
her
turning
up
in
such
a
fashion
with
the
whole
thing
settled
before
father
or
mother
or
maria
or
any
of
us
had
so
much
as
heard
of
the
young
man
much
less
seen
the
tip
of
his
nose
had
too
much
in
common
for
my
taste
with
the
rude
betrothals
of
the
people
with
some
announcement
to
her
employer
that
she
has
exchanged
vows
with
the
i
was
indignant
quite
artlessly
indignant
i
fear
with
the
college
authorities
barbarously
irresponsible
as
it
struck
me
for
when
i
broke
out
about
them
to
poor
mother
she
surprised
me
though
i
confess
she
had
sometimes
surprised
me
before
by
her
deep
fatalism
oh
i
suppose
they
do
pretend
not
to
take
their
students
at
the
young
people
own
risk
they
can
scarcely
pretend
to
control
their
affections
she
wonderfully
said
she
seemed
almost
shocked
moreover
that
i
could
impute
either
to
father
or
to
herself
any
disposition
to
control
peggy
it
was
one
of
the
few
occasions
of
my
life
on
which
i
suffered
irritation
from
poor
mother
and
yet
i
now
not
sure
after
all
that
she
was
again
but
at
her
old
game
even
then
for
she
has
certainly
been
so
since
of
protecting
poor
father
by
feigning
a
like
flaccidity
from
the
full
appearance
not
to
say
the
full
dishonor
of
his
failure
ever
to
meet
a
domestic
responsibility
it
came
over
me
that
there
would
be
absolutely
nobody
to
meet
this
one
and
my
own
peculiar
chance
glimmered
upon
me
therefore
on
the
spot
i
retrace
steps
and
stages
suffice
it
that
my
opportunity
developed
and
broadened
to
my
watching
eyes
with
each
precipitated
consequence
of
the
wretched
youth
arrival
he
proved
without
delay
an
infant
in
arms
an
infant
either
according
to
circumstances
crowing
and
kicking
and
clamoring
for
sustenance
or
wailing
and
choking
and
refusing
even
the
bottle
to
the
point
even
as
i
just
seen
in
new
york
of
imminent
convulsions
the
arms
most
appropriate
to
his
case
suddenly
announced
themselves
in
fine
to
our
general
consternation
as
eliza
but
it
was
at
this
unnatural
vision
that
my
heart
indeed
leaped
up
i
was
beforehand
even
with
lorraine
she
was
still
gaping
while
in
three
bold
strokes
i
sketched
to
her
our
campaign
i
take
command
the
others
are
flat
on
their
backs
i
save
little
pathetic
peg
even
in
spite
of
herself
though
her
just
resentment
is
really
much
greater
than
she
dares
poor
mite
recognize
amazing
scruple
by
which
i
mean
i
guard
her
against
a
possible
relapse
i
save
poor
mother
that
is
i
rid
her
of
the
deadly
eliza
forever
and
a
day
despised
rejected
misunderstood
i
nevertheless
intervene
in
its
hour
of
dire
need
as
the
good
genius
of
the
family
and
you
dear
little
quaint
thing
i
take
advantage
of
the
precious
psychological
moment
to
whisk
you
off
to
europe
we
take
peg
with
us
for
a
year
true
culture
she
wants
a
year
true
culture
pretty
badly
but
she
does
as
it
turns
out
want
goward
a
and
i
do
it
all
in
my
own
way
before
they
can
recover
breath
they
recover
it
if
we
but
give
them
time
to
bless
our
name
but
by
that
moment
we
shall
have
struck
for
freedom
well
then
my
own
way
it
was
given
me
as
lorraine
says
was
taking
the
night
express
without
a
word
to
any
one
but
peg
whom
it
was
charming
at
the
supreme
hour
to
feel
glimmeringly
with
us
my
own
way
i
say
was
to
go
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
i
had
breakfasted
to
the
address
lorraine
had
been
able
by
an
immense
piece
of
luck
to
suggest
to
me
as
a
possible
clue
to
whereabouts
she
either
be
with
her
friends
the
chataways
in
east
street
she
always
swaggering
about
the
chataways
who
by
her
account
are
tremendous
as
she
has
told
lorraine
the
right
term
is
in
london
leading
a
life
that
is
a
burden
to
them
without
her
or
else
they
know
where
she
is
that
at
least
what
i
hope
said
my
wife
with
infinite
feminine
subtlety
the
chataways
as
a
subject
of
swagger
presented
themselves
even
to
my
rustic
vision
oddly
i
may
be
mistaken
about
new
york
values
but
the
grandeur
of
this
connection
was
brought
home
to
me
neither
by
the
high
lopsided
stoop
of
its
very
very
east
side
setting
nor
by
the
appearance
of
a
terrible
massive
lady
who
came
to
the
door
while
i
was
in
quite
unproductive
parley
with
an
unmistakably
a
hopelessly
mystified
menial
an
outlandish
young
woman
with
a
face
of
dark
despair
and
an
intelligence
closed
to
any
mere
indigenous
appeal
i
was
to
learn
later
in
the
day
that
she
a
macedonian
christian
whom
the
chataways
harbor
against
the
cruel
turk
in
return
for
domestic
service
a
romantic
item
that
eliza
named
to
me
in
rueful
correction
of
the
absence
of
several
indeed
that
are
apparently
prosaic
enough
the
powder
on
the
massive
lady
face
indeed
transcended
i
rather
thought
the
bounds
of
prose
did
much
to
refer
her
to
the
realm
of
fantasy
some
forlorn
an
effect
the
more
marked
as
the
wrapper
she
appeared
hastily
to
have
caught
up
and
which
was
somehow
both
voluminous
and
tense
flowing
like
a
cataract
in
some
places
yet
in
others
exposing
or
at
least
denning
the
ample
bed
of
the
stream
reminded
me
of
the
big
cloth
spread
in
a
room
when
any
mess
is
to
be
made
she
apologized
when
i
said
i
had
come
to
inquire
for
miss
talbert
mentioned
with
play
of
a
wonderfully
fine
fat
hand
that
she
herself
was
just
being
manicured
in
the
parlor
but
was
evidently
surprised
at
my
asking
about
eliza
which
plunged
her
into
the
question
it
suffused
her
extravagant
blondness
with
a
troubled
light
struggling
there
like
a
sunrise
over
snow
of
whether
she
had
better
confessing
to
ignorance
relieve
her
curiosity
or
pretending
to
knowledge
baffle
mine
but
mine
of
course
carried
the
day
for
mine
showed
it
could
wait
while
hers
could
the
final
superiority
of
women
to
men
being
in
fact
i
think
that
we
are
more
patiently
curious
why
is
she
in
the
city
if
she
is
dear
madam
i
replied
she
ought
to
be
she
left
eastridge
last
evening
for
parts
unknown
and
should
have
got
here
by
oh
how
glad
i
was
to
let
them
both
in
as
far
as
i
possibly
could
and
clearly
now
i
had
let
chataway
if
such
she
was
in
very
far
indeed
she
stared
but
then
airily
considered
oh
well
i
guess
i
guess
she
is
i
replied
she
has
got
here
yet
she
has
so
many
friends
in
the
city
but
she
always
wants
us
and
when
she
does
come
with
which
my
friend
now
so
far
relieved
and
agreeably
smiling
rubbed
together
conspicuously
the
pair
of
plump
subjects
of
her
you
feel
then
i
inquired
that
she
will
come
oh
i
guess
she
be
round
this
afternoon
we
would
forgive
her
ah
i
afraid
we
must
forgive
her
i
was
careful
to
declare
but
i
come
back
on
the
any
message
then
yes
please
say
her
nephew
from
eastridge
oh
her
nephew
her
nephew
she
understand
i
come
back
i
repeated
but
got
to
find
her
and
as
in
the
fever
of
my
need
i
turned
and
sped
away
i
roamed
i
quite
careered
about
in
those
uptown
streets
but
instinctively
and
confidently
westward
i
felt
i
do
know
why
miraculously
sure
of
some
favoring
chance
and
as
if
i
were
floating
in
the
current
of
success
i
was
on
the
way
to
our
reward
i
was
positively
on
the
way
to
paris
and
new
york
itself
vast
and
glittering
and
roaring
much
noisier
even
than
the
works
at
their
noisiest
but
with
its
old
rich
thrill
of
the
art
league
days
again
in
the
air
was
already
almost
paris
for
me
so
that
when
i
at
last
fidgeted
into
the
park
where
you
get
so
beautifully
away
from
the
town
it
was
surely
the
next
thing
to
europe
and
in
fact
had
to
be
since
it
the
very
antithesis
of
eastridge
i
regularly
revelled
in
that
sense
that
eliza
have
done
a
better
thing
for
us
than
just
not
be
that
morning
where
it
was
supremely
advisable
she
should
have
been
if
she
had
had
two
grains
of
sense
she
would
have
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
chataways
with
the
lark
or
at
least
with
the
manicure
who
seems
there
almost
as
early
stirring
or
rather
really
she
would
have
reported
herself
as
soon
as
their
train
that
of
the
guilty
couple
got
in
no
matter
how
late
in
the
evening
it
was
at
any
rate
actually
uplifting
to
realize
that
i
had
got
thus
in
three
minutes
the
pull
of
her
in
regard
to
her
great
new
york
friends
my
eye
as
lorraine
says
how
she
has
on
all
this
ground
of
those
people
been
piling
it
on
if
maria
who
has
so
bowed
her
head
gets
any
such
glimpse
of
what
her
aunt
has
been
making
her
bow
it
to
well
i
think
i
shall
then
entertain
something
of
the
human
pity
for
eliza
that
i
found
myself
while
i
walked
about
fairly
entertaining
for
my
sister
what
were
they
what
are
they
the
chataways
anyhow
i
do
even
yet
know
i
confess
but
now
i
do
want
to
i
do
care
a
hang
having
no
further
use
for
them
whatever
but
on
one
of
the
park
benches
in
the
golden
morning
the
wonderment
added
i
remember
to
my
joy
for
we
had
lorraine
and
i
been
the
least
bit
overwhelmed
about
them
lorraine
only
pretending
a
little
with
her
charming
elfish
art
that
she
occasionally
was
in
order
to
see
how
far
eliza
would
go
well
that
brilliant
woman
had
gone
pretty
far
for
us
truly
if
after
all
they
were
only
in
the
manicure
line
she
was
of
it
as
lorraine
says
my
massive
lady
was
in
the
parlor
where
i
do
suppose
it
usually
done
and
are
there
such
places
precisely
as
manicure
parlors
where
they
do
nothing
else
or
at
least
are
supposed
to
oh
i
do
hope
for
the
perfection
of
it
that
this
may
be
what
eliza
has
kept
from
us
otherwise
by
all
the
gods
it
just
a
there
was
exactly
the
smell
in
the
hall
the
smell
that
pervaded
my
old
greasy
haunt
of
the
league
days
that
boiled
atmosphere
that
seems
to
belong
at
once
confusedly
to
a
domestic
wash
and
to
inferior
food
as
if
the
former
were
perhaps
being
prepared
in
the
saucepan
and
the
latter
in
the
tubs
there
also
came
back
to
me
i
recollect
that
note
of
queer
look
at
me
on
my
saying
i
was
eliza
nephew
the
droll
effect
of
her
making
on
her
side
a
discovery
about
me
yes
she
made
it
and
as
against
me
of
course
against
all
of
us
at
sight
of
me
so
that
if
eliza
has
bragged
at
eastridge
about
new
york
she
has
at
least
bragged
in
new
york
about
eastridge
i
did
clearly
for
chataway
come
up
to
the
brag
or
perhaps
rather
did
come
down
to
it
since
i
dare
say
the
poor
lady
consternation
meant
simply
that
my
aunt
has
confessed
to
me
but
as
an
unconsidered
trifle
a
gifted
child
at
the
most
or
as
young
and
handsome
and
dashing
at
the
most
and
not
as
well
as
what
i
am
whatever
i
am
in
any
case
and
however
awkward
a
document
as
nephew
to
a
girlish
aunt
i
believe
i
really
tasted
of
the
joy
of
life
in
its
highest
intensity
when
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
of
the
park
i
suddenly
saw
my
absurd
presentiment
of
a
miracle
justified
i
could
of
course
scarce
believe
my
eyes
when
at
the
turn
of
a
quiet
alley
pulling
up
to
gape
i
recognized
in
a
young
man
brooding
on
a
bench
ten
yards
off
the
precious
personality
of
harry
goward
there
he
languished
alone
our
feebler
fugitive
handed
over
to
me
by
a
mysterious
fate
and
a
incredible
hazard
there
is
certainly
but
one
place
in
all
new
york
where
the
stricken
deer
may
weep
or
even
for
that
matter
the
hart
ungalled
play
the
wonder
of
my
coincidence
shrank
a
little
that
is
before
the
fact
that
when
young
ardor
or
young
despair
wishes
to
commune
with
immensity
it
can
only
do
so
either
in
a
hall
bedroom
or
in
just
this
corner
practically
where
i
pounced
on
my
prey
to
sit
down
in
short
you
got
to
sit
there
there
another
square
inch
of
the
whole
place
over
which
you
have
got
as
everything
shrieks
at
you
to
step
lively
poor
goward
i
could
see
at
a
glance
wanted
very
much
to
sit
down
looked
indeed
very
much
as
if
he
wanted
never
never
again
to
get
up
i
hovered
there
i
could
help
it
a
bit
gloatingly
before
i
pounced
and
yet
even
when
he
became
aware
of
me
as
he
did
in
a
minute
he
did
shift
his
position
by
an
inch
but
only
took
me
and
my
dreadful
meaning
with
his
wan
stare
as
a
part
of
the
strange
burden
of
his
fate
he
did
seem
even
surprised
to
speak
of
he
had
waked
up
premising
his
brief
bewildered
delirium
to
the
sense
that
something
natural
must
happen
and
even
to
the
fond
hope
that
something
natural
would
and
i
was
simply
the
form
in
which
it
was
happening
i
came
nearer
i
stood
before
him
and
he
kept
up
at
me
the
oddest
stare
which
was
plainly
but
the
dumb
yearning
that
i
would
explain
explain
he
wanted
everything
told
him
but
every
single
thing
as
if
after
a
tremendous
fall
or
some
wild
parabola
through
the
air
the
effect
of
a
violent
explosion
under
his
feet
he
had
landed
at
a
vast
distance
from
his
and
required
to
know
where
he
was
well
the
charming
thing
was
that
this
affected
me
as
giving
the
very
sharpest
point
to
the
idea
that
in
asking
myself
how
i
should
deal
with
him
i
had
already
so
vividly
entertained
viii
the
married
daughter
by
elizabeth
stuart
phelps
we
start
in
life
with
the
most
preposterous
of
all
human
claims
that
one
should
be
understood
we
get
bravely
over
that
after
awhile
but
not
until
the
idea
has
been
knocked
out
of
us
by
the
hardest
i
used
to
worry
a
good
deal
myself
because
nobody
distinctly
not
one
person
in
our
family
understood
me
that
is
me
in
my
relation
to
themselves
nothing
else
of
course
mattered
so
much
but
that
was
before
i
was
married
i
think
it
was
because
tom
understood
me
from
the
very
first
that
i
loved
him
enough
to
marry
him
and
learn
to
understand
him
i
always
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
in
that
beautiful
art
i
suppose
one
might
call
it
the
at
all
events
it
has
been
of
the
least
possible
consequence
to
me
since
i
had
tom
whether
any
one
else
in
the
world
understood
me
or
not
i
suppose
in
fact
i
know
that
it
is
this
unfortunate
affair
of
peggy
which
has
brought
up
all
that
old
soreness
to
the
surface
of
me
nobody
knows
better
than
i
that
i
have
not
been
a
popular
member
of
this
family
but
nobody
knows
as
well
as
i
how
hard
i
have
tried
to
do
my
conscientious
best
by
the
whole
of
them
collectively
and
individually
considered
an
older
sister
if
she
have
any
consciousness
of
responsibility
at
all
is
to
my
mind
not
in
an
easy
position
her
extra
years
give
her
an
extra
sense
one
might
call
it
a
sixth
sense
of
family
anxiety
which
the
younger
children
can
not
share
she
has
in
a
way
the
intelligence
and
forethought
of
a
mother
without
a
authority
or
privilege
when
father
had
that
typhoid
and
could
not
sleep
dear
father
in
his
normal
condition
he
sleeps
like
a
bag
of
who
was
there
in
all
the
house
to
keep
those
boys
quiet
nobody
but
me
when
they
organized
a
military
company
in
our
back
yard
directly
under
father
windows
two
drums
a
a
a
fife
and
three
tin
pans
was
there
anybody
but
me
to
put
a
stop
to
it
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
the
pet
name
moolymaria
afterward
corrupted
into
messymaria
and
finally
evolved
into
meddlymaria
became
attached
to
me
to
this
day
i
do
not
like
to
think
how
many
cries
i
had
over
it
then
when
charles
edward
got
into
debt
and
nobody
dared
to
tell
father
and
when
billy
had
the
measles
and
there
was
a
throat
in
the
house
to
read
to
him
four
hours
a
day
except
my
unpopular
throat
and
when
charles
edward
had
that
quarrel
over
a
girl
with
a
dress
and
cerise
or
when
alice
fell
in
love
with
an
automobile
the
chauffeur
being
incidentally
thrown
in
and
took
to
riding
around
the
country
with
him
who
put
a
stop
to
it
who
was
the
only
person
in
the
family
that
could
put
a
stop
to
it
then
again
but
what
the
use
my
very
temperament
i
can
see
now
i
did
see
it
when
i
lived
at
home
is
in
itself
an
unpopular
one
in
a
family
like
ours
i
forecast
i
foresee
i
provide
i
plan
it
is
my
natur
i
ca
go
sprawling
through
life
i
must
know
where
i
am
to
set
my
foot
dear
mother
has
no
more
sense
of
anxiety
than
a
rice
pudding
and
father
is
as
cool
as
one
of
his
own
we
all
know
what
charles
edward
is
and
i
did
count
grandmother
and
aunt
elizabeth
there
has
been
my
blunder
i
ought
to
have
counted
aunt
elizabeth
i
ought
to
have
fathomed
her
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
she
was
deep
enough
to
drop
a
plummet
in
i
the
the
caretaker
the
worrier
i
who
am
opprobriously
called
the
manager
in
this
family
i
have
failed
them
at
this
critical
point
in
their
household
history
i
did
not
foresee
i
did
not
forecast
i
did
not
worry
i
did
not
manage
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
manage
after
we
had
got
peggy
safely
graduated
and
engaged
and
now
this
dreadful
thing
has
gaped
beneath
us
like
the
fissures
at
san
francisco
or
kingston
and
poor
little
peggy
has
tumbled
into
it
a
teacupful
of
management
might
have
prevented
it
an
ounce
of
worry
would
have
saved
it
all
i
lacked
that
teacupful
i
missed
that
ounce
the
veriest
popular
optimist
could
have
done
no
worse
i
am
smothered
with
my
own
stupidity
i
have
borne
this
humiliating
condition
of
things
as
long
as
i
can
i
propose
to
go
over
to
that
house
and
take
the
helm
in
this
emergency
i
do
care
whether
i
am
popular
or
unpopular
for
it
but
something
has
got
to
be
done
for
peggy
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
i
have
been
over
and
i
have
done
it
i
have
taken
the
management
of
the
whole
thing
not
even
discouraged
by
this
unfortunate
word
i
own
i
am
rather
raw
to
it
but
the
time
has
come
when
though
i
bled
beneath
it
i
must
act
as
if
i
did
at
all
events
i
must
act
i
have
acted
i
am
going
to
new
york
by
the
early
morning
express
the
i
would
go
fact
i
really
ought
to
go
but
tom
has
a
supper
on
with
some
visitors
to
the
works
he
wo
be
home
till
late
and
i
ca
go
without
seeing
tom
it
would
hurt
his
feelings
and
that
is
a
thing
no
wife
ought
to
do
and
my
kind
of
wife
ca
do
i
found
the
house
in
its
usual
gelatinous
condition
there
a
in
it
scarcely
an
to
stand
upon
plenty
of
crying
but
no
thinking
a
mush
of
talk
but
no
decision
to
cap
the
situation
charles
edward
has
gone
on
to
new
york
with
a
preposterous
conviction
that
he
can
clear
it
up
charles
edward
if
there
is
a
living
member
of
the
household
but
never
mind
that
this
circumstance
was
enough
for
me
that
all
it
brought
out
all
the
determination
in
me
all
the
manager
if
you
choose
to
put
it
so
i
shall
go
to
new
york
myself
and
take
the
whole
thing
in
hand
if
i
needed
anything
to
padlock
my
purpose
those
dozen
words
with
peggy
would
have
turned
the
key
upon
it
when
i
found
that
she
was
crying
when
i
got
face
to
face
with
that
soft
fine
excitement
in
the
eyes
which
a
girl
wears
when
she
has
a
not
stagnant
but
in
action
i
concluded
at
once
that
peggy
had
her
reservations
and
was
keeping
something
from
me
on
pretence
of
wanting
a
doughnut
i
got
her
into
the
pantry
and
shut
both
doors
peggy
i
said
what
has
charles
edward
gone
to
new
york
for
do
you
know
peggy
wound
a
big
doughnut
spinning
around
her
engagement
finger
and
made
no
reply
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
you
and
harry
goward
you
must
tell
me
peggy
you
must
tell
me
peggy
put
a
doughnut
on
her
wedding
finger
and
observed
with
pained
perplexity
that
it
would
not
spin
but
stuck
what
is
charles
edward
up
to
i
persisted
the
opening
of
peggy
face
took
on
a
furtive
expression
like
that
of
certain
pansies
or
some
orchids
i
have
seen
he
is
going
to
take
me
to
europe
she
admitted
removing
both
her
doughnut
rings
you
to
europe
he
and
lorraine
when
this
is
blown
by
they
want
to
get
me
away
from
what
away
from
harry
goward
oh
i
suppose
so
blubbered
peggy
she
now
began
in
a
perfectly
normal
manner
to
mop
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
do
you
want
to
be
got
away
from
harry
goward
i
demanded
i
never
said
i
did
sobbed
peggy
i
never
said
so
not
one
little
bit
but
oh
maria
moolymaria
you
ca
think
how
dreadful
it
is
to
be
a
girl
an
engaged
girl
and
not
know
what
to
do
then
and
there
an
active
idea
one
with
bones
in
it
raced
and
overtook
me
and
i
shot
out
where
is
that
letter
mother
has
it
replied
peggy
have
you
opened
it
has
aunt
elizabeth
opened
it
oh
no
did
charlies
edward
take
it
with
him
i
do
think
he
did
i
will
go
ask
go
ask
mother
for
that
letter
i
commanded
and
bring
it
to
peggy
gave
me
one
mutinous
look
but
the
instinct
of
a
younger
sister
was
in
her
and
she
obeyed
me
she
brought
the
letter
i
have
this
precious
document
in
my
pocket
i
asked
her
if
she
would
trust
me
to
find
out
to
whom
that
letter
was
addressed
after
some
hesitation
she
replied
that
she
would
i
reminded
her
that
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
give
me
this
authority
which
pleased
her
i
told
her
that
i
should
accept
it
as
a
solemn
trust
and
do
my
highest
and
best
with
it
for
her
sake
peggy
i
said
this
is
not
altogether
a
pleasant
job
for
me
but
you
are
my
little
sister
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
kiss
your
old
meddlymaria
she
took
down
her
sopping
handkerchief
and
lifted
her
warm
wet
face
so
i
kissed
peggy
and
i
am
going
on
the
morning
train
it
is
now
ten
my
is
packed
my
ticket
is
bought
but
tom
has
not
come
back
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
ca
get
back
he
telephoned
between
courses
at
his
dinner
that
he
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
go
home
for
the
night
with
one
of
the
men
they
are
dining
it
seems
he
is
a
person
of
importance
there
is
a
big
order
behind
the
junket
and
tom
has
gone
home
with
him
to
talk
it
over
the
ridiculous
thing
about
it
is
that
i
forget
where
he
was
going
of
course
i
could
telephone
to
the
hotel
and
find
out
but
men
do
like
telephoning
wives
at
least
my
man
does
it
makes
it
rather
hard
going
on
this
trip
without
kissing
tom
i
had
half
made
up
my
mind
to
throw
the
whole
thing
over
but
peggy
is
pretty
young
she
has
a
long
life
before
her
there
is
a
good
deal
at
stake
so
tom
and
i
kissed
by
electricity
and
he
said
that
it
was
all
right
and
to
go
ahead
and
the
other
absurd
thing
about
that
is
that
tom
did
ask
me
for
my
new
york
address
and
i
forgot
to
tell
him
we
are
like
two
asteroids
spinning
through
space
neither
knowing
the
other
route
or
destination
in
point
of
fact
i
shall
register
at
the
sphinx
that
nice
ladies
hotel
where
mere
man
is
never
admitted
i
have
always
supposed
that
the
chataway
aunt
elizabeth
talks
about
kept
a
i
think
aunt
elizabeth
rolls
in
upon
her
like
a
spent
wave
between
visits
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
be
able
to
trace
aunt
elizabeth
by
her
weeds
upon
this
beach
after
that
the
rest
is
easy
i
must
leave
my
address
for
tom
pinned
up
somewhere
mind
would
hold
it
if
i
stuck
it
through
her
brain
with
a
i
think
i
will
glue
it
to
his
library
table
and
i
do
it
this
minute
to
make
sure
i
have
directed
matilda
to
give
him
chicken
croquettes
for
his
luncheon
and
i
have
written
out
the
menu
for
every
meal
till
i
get
home
poor
tom
he
is
used
to
eating
alone
i
wish
i
thought
he
would
mind
it
as
much
as
i
do
eleven
i
am
obsessed
with
an
idea
and
i
have
yielded
to
it
whether
for
good
or
ill
for
wisdom
or
folly
remains
to
be
proved
i
have
telephoned
denbigh
and
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
go
to
new
york
too
considered
in
any
light
but
that
of
peggy
welfare
but
i
am
not
considering
anything
in
any
light
but
that
of
peggy
welfare
denbigh
used
to
have
a
little
tendresse
for
peggy
it
was
never
anything
more
i
am
convinced
she
is
too
young
for
him
a
doctor
sees
so
many
women
he
grows
critical
if
not
captious
character
goes
for
more
with
him
than
with
most
men
looks
go
for
less
and
poor
little
peggy
who
can
deny
up
to
this
point
in
her
development
is
chiefly
looks
i
intimated
to
the
doctor
that
my
errand
to
new
york
was
of
an
important
nature
that
it
concerned
my
younger
sister
that
my
husband
was
unfortunately
out
of
town
and
that
i
needed
masculine
advice
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
flattering
the
doctor
and
he
swallowed
this
delicate
bait
as
i
thought
he
would
when
i
asked
him
if
he
did
think
he
needed
a
little
vacation
if
he
did
think
he
could
get
the
old
doctor
from
southwest
eastridge
to
take
his
practice
for
two
days
he
said
he
did
know
but
he
could
the
grippe
epidemic
had
gone
down
nothing
more
strenuous
than
a
few
cases
of
measles
stood
in
the
way
in
fact
eastridge
at
the
present
time
he
averred
was
lamentably
healthy
when
he
had
committed
himself
so
far
as
this
he
hesitated
and
very
seriously
said
mrs
price
you
have
never
asked
me
to
do
a
foolish
thing
and
i
have
known
you
for
a
good
many
years
it
is
too
late
to
come
over
and
talk
it
out
with
you
if
you
assure
me
that
you
consider
your
object
in
making
this
request
important
i
will
go
we
wo
waste
words
about
it
what
train
do
you
take
i
am
not
a
person
of
divination
or
intuition
i
think
i
have
rather
a
commonplace
careful
painstaking
mind
but
if
ever
i
had
an
inspiration
in
my
life
i
think
i
have
one
now
perhaps
it
is
the
novelty
of
it
that
makes
me
confide
in
it
with
so
little
reflection
my
inspiration
in
a
word
is
this
aunt
elizabeth
has
reached
the
point
where
she
is
ready
for
a
new
man
i
know
i
do
understand
her
kind
of
woman
by
experience
i
do
suppose
i
do
by
sympathy
i
have
to
reason
her
out
i
have
reasoned
aunt
elizabeth
out
to
this
conclusion
she
always
has
had
she
always
must
have
she
always
will
have
the
admiration
of
some
man
or
men
to
engross
her
attention
she
is
an
attractive
woman
she
knows
it
women
admit
it
and
men
feel
it
i
do
think
aunt
elizabeth
is
a
heartless
person
not
an
irresponsible
one
only
an
idle
and
unhappy
one
she
lives
on
this
intoxicant
as
other
women
might
live
on
tea
or
gossip
as
a
man
would
take
his
dram
or
his
tobacco
she
drinks
this
wine
because
she
is
thirsty
and
the
plain
cool
of
life
has
grown
stale
to
her
it
is
corked
up
in
bottles
like
the
water
sold
in
towns
where
the
is
low
it
has
ceased
to
be
palatable
to
her
my
interpretation
is
that
there
is
no
man
on
her
horizon
just
now
except
harry
goward
and
i
wo
do
her
the
injustice
to
believe
that
she
would
be
thankful
to
be
rid
of
him
just
for
her
own
sake
to
say
nothing
of
peggy
aunt
elizabeth
i
repeat
needs
a
new
man
if
denbigh
is
willing
to
fill
this
role
for
a
few
days
of
course
i
must
be
perfectly
frank
with
him
about
it
the
effect
upon
harry
goward
will
be
instantaneous
his
disillusion
will
be
complete
his
return
to
peggy
in
a
state
of
abject
humiliation
will
be
assured
i
mean
assuming
that
the
fellow
is
capable
of
manly
feeling
and
that
peggy
has
aroused
it
that
of
course
remains
for
me
to
find
out
how
i
am
to
fish
harry
goward
out
of
the
ocean
of
new
york
city
trouble
me
in
the
least
given
aunt
elizabeth
he
will
complete
the
equation
if
chataway
should
fail
me
but
i
wo
suppose
that
chataway
will
fail
i
must
be
sure
and
explain
to
tom
about
denbigh
the
sphinx
new
york
i
arrived
that
is
to
say
we
arrived
in
this
town
at
ten
minutes
past
one
almost
ten
hours
ago
denbigh
has
gone
somewhere
and
that
reminds
me
that
i
forgot
to
ask
him
where
i
never
thought
of
it
until
this
minute
but
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
it
may
be
quite
as
well
from
an
ignorant
point
of
view
that
the
sphinx
excludes
mere
man
from
its
portals
he
was
good
to
me
on
the
train
very
good
indeed
i
ca
deny
that
he
flushed
a
little
when
i
told
him
frankly
what
i
wanted
of
him
at
first
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
angry
then
i
saw
the
corners
of
his
mustache
twitch
then
our
sense
of
humor
got
the
better
of
us
and
then
i
laughed
and
then
he
laughed
and
i
felt
that
the
crisis
was
passed
i
explained
to
him
while
we
were
in
the
pullman
car
as
well
as
i
could
without
being
overheard
by
a
fat
lady
with
three
chins
and
a
girl
with
a
permit
for
a
pet
poodle
what
it
was
that
i
wanted
of
him
i
related
the
story
of
peggy
misfortune
in
confidence
of
course
and
explained
the
part
he
was
expected
to
play
confidentially
of
course
in
fact
i
laid
my
plot
before
him
from
beginning
to
end
if
the
boy
does
love
her
you
see
i
suggested
the
sooner
we
know
it
the
better
she
must
break
it
off
if
her
heart
is
broken
in
the
process
if
he
does
love
her
my
private
opinion
is
he
thinks
he
does
i
wo
have
peggy
whole
future
wrecked
by
one
of
aunt
flirtations
the
reef
is
too
small
for
the
catastrophe
i
shall
find
aunt
elizabeth
oh
yes
i
shall
find
aunt
elizabeth
i
have
no
more
doubt
of
that
than
i
have
that
matilda
is
putting
too
much
onion
in
the
croquettes
for
tom
this
blessed
minute
if
i
find
her
i
shall
find
the
boy
but
what
good
is
that
going
to
do
me
if
i
find
either
of
them
or
both
of
them
if
we
ca
disillusionize
the
boy
in
a
word
interrupted
the
doctor
rather
tartly
all
you
want
of
me
is
to
walk
across
the
troubled
stage
for
peggy
sake
i
observed
of
course
yes
for
peggy
sake
i
am
to
walk
across
this
fantastic
stage
in
the
inglorious
capacity
of
a
that
is
precisely
it
i
admitted
i
want
you
to
philander
with
aunt
elizabeth
for
two
days
one
day
two
hours
one
hour
just
long
enough
only
long
enough
to
bring
that
fool
boy
to
his
if
i
had
suspected
the
nature
of
the
purpose
i
am
to
serve
in
this
complication
began
the
doctor
without
a
smile
i
trusted
your
judgment
price
and
good
sense
i
have
never
known
either
to
fail
before
however
he
added
manfully
i
am
in
for
it
now
and
i
would
do
more
disagreeable
things
than
this
for
peggy
sake
but
perhaps
he
suggested
grimly
we
find
either
of
he
retired
from
the
subject
obviously
if
gracefully
and
began
to
play
with
the
poodle
that
had
the
pullman
permit
i
happen
to
know
that
if
there
is
any
species
of
dog
the
doctor
does
not
love
it
is
a
poodle
with
or
without
a
permit
the
lady
with
three
chins
asked
me
if
my
husband
were
fond
of
dogs
i
think
she
said
so
fond
as
that
she
glanced
at
the
girl
whom
the
poodle
owned
i
do
know
why
it
should
be
a
surprise
to
me
but
it
was
that
the
chin
lady
and
the
poodle
girl
have
both
registered
at
the
directly
after
luncheon
for
i
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
minute
i
went
to
chataway
the
agreement
being
that
the
doctor
should
follow
me
in
an
way
a
little
later
but
there
was
a
blockade
on
the
way
and
i
was
on
time
what
i
took
to
be
chataway
herself
admitted
me
with
undisguised
hesitation
miss
talbert
she
said
was
not
at
home
that
is
no
she
was
not
home
she
explained
that
a
great
many
people
had
been
asking
for
miss
talbert
there
were
two
in
the
parlor
now
when
i
demanded
two
what
she
replied
in
a
breathless
tone
two
gentlemen
and
ushered
me
into
that
architectural
effort
known
to
early
new
york
as
a
front
and
back
parlor
one
of
the
gentlemen
as
i
expected
proved
to
be
denbigh
the
other
was
flatly
and
unmistakably
charles
edward
the
doctor
offered
to
excuse
himself
but
i
took
charles
edward
into
the
back
parlor
and
i
made
so
bold
as
to
draw
the
i
felt
that
the
occasion
justified
worse
than
this
the
colloquy
between
myself
and
charles
edward
was
brief
and
pointed
he
began
by
saying
you
here
what
a
mess
my
conviction
is
that
he
saved
himself
just
in
time
from
messymaria
have
you
found
him
i
propounded
have
seen
him
i
did
say
i
had
seen
what
did
he
say
i
insisted
not
very
much
it
was
in
the
in
the
park
not
very
much
how
could
you
let
him
go
i
did
let
him
go
drawled
charles
edward
he
invited
me
to
dinner
a
man
ca
ask
a
fellow
what
his
intentions
are
to
a
man
sister
in
a
park
i
had
said
very
much
up
to
that
point
he
did
most
of
the
talking
i
thought
i
would
put
it
off
till
we
got
round
to
the
then
i
cried
impatiently
and
then
you
see
reluctantly
admitted
charles
edward
there
was
any
then
i
did
dine
with
him
after
all
i
could
find
it
could
find
what
could
find
the
hotel
said
charles
edward
defiantly
i
lost
the
address
could
even
say
that
it
was
a
hotel
i
believe
it
was
a
club
he
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
a
swell
for
a
coeducational
professor
anyhow
i
lost
the
address
and
that
is
the
long
and
short
of
if
it
had
been
a
studio
or
a
bohemian
cafe
i
began
i
should
undoubtedly
have
remembered
it
admitted
charles
edward
in
his
languid
way
you
have
lost
him
i
replied
frostily
you
have
lost
harry
goward
and
you
come
here
on
the
same
errand
i
presume
my
distressed
and
distressing
sister
that
has
brought
you
have
you
seen
her
he
demanded
with
sudden
uncharacteristic
shrewdness
at
this
moment
a
portiere
opened
at
the
side
of
my
back
parlor
and
chataway
voluminously
appearing
mysteriously
beckoned
me
i
followed
her
into
the
dreariest
hall
i
think
i
ever
saw
even
in
a
new
york
there
the
landlady
frankly
told
me
that
miss
talbert
was
out
she
was
in
her
room
packing
to
make
one
of
her
visits
miss
talbert
had
given
orders
that
she
was
to
be
denied
to
gentlemen
friends
no
she
never
said
anything
about
ladies
this
i
thought
highly
probable
but
if
i
were
anything
to
her
and
chose
to
take
the
responsibility
i
chose
and
i
did
in
five
minutes
i
was
in
aunt
elizabeth
room
and
had
turned
the
key
upon
an
interview
which
was
briefer
but
more
startling
than
i
could
possibly
have
anticipated
elizabeth
talbert
is
one
of
those
women
whose
attraction
increases
with
the
negligee
or
the
deshabille
she
was
so
pretty
in
her
pink
kimono
that
she
half
disarmed
me
she
had
been
crying
and
had
a
gentle
look
when
i
said
where
is
he
and
when
she
said
if
you
mean
harry
goward
i
do
know
i
was
prepared
to
believe
her
without
evidence
she
looked
too
pretty
to
doubt
besides
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
ever
caught
aunt
elizabeth
in
a
real
fib
she
may
be
a
charmian
but
i
do
think
she
is
a
liar
yet
i
pushed
my
case
severely
if
you
and
he
had
taken
that
train
to
new
york
we
did
take
the
train
retorted
elizabeth
talbert
hotly
it
took
us
you
do
suppose
but
i
suppose
you
do
and
i
suppose
i
know
what
the
whole
family
supposes
as
if
i
would
do
such
a
dastardly
as
if
i
did
clear
out
on
purpose
to
get
away
from
him
to
get
out
of
the
whole
mix
as
if
i
knew
that
young
one
would
be
aboard
that
train
but
he
was
aboard
you
admit
oh
yes
he
got
made
a
pleasant
travelling
companion
auntie
i
do
know
said
aunt
elizabeth
shortly
i
did
have
ten
words
with
him
i
told
him
he
had
put
me
in
a
position
i
should
never
forgive
then
he
told
me
i
had
put
him
in
a
worse
we
quarrelled
and
he
went
into
the
smoker
at
the
grand
central
he
checked
my
suitcase
and
lifted
his
hat
he
did
ask
if
i
were
going
to
chataway
i
have
never
seen
him
aunt
elizabeth
i
said
sadly
i
am
younger
than
you
not
so
very
much
retorted
aunt
elizabeth
and
i
must
speak
to
you
with
the
respect
due
my
father
sister
when
i
say
that
the
nobility
of
your
conduct
on
this
occasion
a
nobility
which
you
will
pardon
me
for
suggesting
that
i
did
altogether
count
on
is
likely
to
prove
the
catastrophe
of
the
aunt
elizabeth
stared
at
me
with
her
wet
coquettish
eyes
pretty
hard
on
me
maria
she
said
you
always
hurry
and
dress
i
suggested
soothingly
there
are
two
gentlemen
to
see
you
aunt
elizabeth
shook
her
head
she
asserted
with
evident
sincerity
that
she
did
wish
to
see
any
gentlemen
she
did
care
to
see
any
gentlemen
under
any
circumstances
she
never
meant
to
have
anything
to
do
with
gentlemen
again
she
said
something
about
becoming
a
deaconess
in
the
episcopal
church
she
spoke
of
the
attractions
in
the
life
of
a
trained
nurse
mentioned
settlement
work
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
elizabeth
frye
dorothea
dix
and
clara
barton
this
is
one
advantage
that
catholics
have
over
us
she
observed
dreamily
one
could
go
into
a
nunnery
then
one
would
be
quite
sure
there
would
be
no
men
to
let
loose
the
consequences
of
their
natures
and
conduct
upon
a
woman
whole
these
two
downstairs
have
waited
a
good
while
i
returned
carelessly
one
of
them
is
a
married
man
and
is
used
to
it
but
the
other
is
very
well
said
aunt
elizabeth
with
what
it
occurred
to
me
was
a
smile
of
forced
dejection
to
please
you
maria
i
will
go
if
aunt
elizabeth
dejection
were
assumed
mine
was
not
i
have
been
in
the
lowest
possible
spirits
since
my
unlucky
discovery
anything
and
everything
had
occurred
to
me
except
that
she
and
that
boy
could
quarrel
i
had
fancied
him
shadowing
chataway
for
the
slightest
sign
of
his
charmer
i
do
know
that
i
should
have
been
surprised
to
see
him
curled
up
like
a
dog
asleep
on
the
at
the
present
moment
i
have
no
more
means
of
finding
the
wetched
lad
than
i
had
in
eastridge
not
so
much
for
doubtless
peggy
has
his
prehistoric
addresses
i
am
very
unhappy
i
have
not
had
the
heart
left
in
me
to
admire
denbigh
who
has
filled
his
role
brilliantly
all
the
afternoon
in
half
an
hour
he
and
aunt
elizabeth
had
philandered
as
deep
as
a
six
months
flirtation
and
i
must
say
that
they
have
kept
at
it
with
an
art
amounting
almost
to
sincerity
aunt
elizabeth
did
not
once
mention
settlement
work
and
put
no
inquiries
to
denbigh
about
elizabeth
frye
dorothea
dix
or
clara
barton
i
think
he
took
her
to
the
metropolitan
museum
i
know
he
invited
her
to
the
theatre
and
there
is
some
sort
of
an
appointment
for
morning
i
forget
what
but
my
marked
success
at
this
end
of
the
stage
only
adds
poignancy
to
my
sense
of
defeat
at
the
other
i
am
very
homesick
i
wish
i
could
see
tom
i
do
hope
tom
found
my
message
about
denbigh
hours
the
breeze
of
yesterday
has
spun
into
a
whirlwind
i
am
half
stunned
by
the
possibilities
of
human
existence
one
lives
the
simple
life
at
eastridge
and
new
york
strikes
me
on
the
head
like
some
heavy
thing
blown
down
if
these
are
the
results
of
the
very
little
of
one
very
little
girl
what
must
the
great
emotion
the
real
experience
the
vigorous
crisis
bring
at
the
sphinx
as
is
well
known
no
male
being
is
admitted
on
any
pretence
i
believe
the
porter
for
heavy
trunks
is
the
only
exception
the
are
the
clerk
is
a
matron
and
the
proprietress
a
widow
in
at
nine
this
morning
i
was
peremptorily
summoned
out
of
the
and
ordered
to
the
desk
two
frowning
faces
received
me
with
cold
politeness
i
was
reminded
of
the
leading
clause
in
the
constitution
of
that
house
positively
observed
the
clerk
no
gentlemen
callers
are
permitted
at
this
hotel
and
madam
there
are
two
on
the
who
insist
upon
an
interview
with
you
they
have
been
there
half
an
hour
one
of
them
refuses
to
recognize
the
rule
of
the
house
he
insists
upon
an
immediate
suspension
of
it
i
regret
to
tell
you
that
he
went
so
far
as
to
mention
that
he
would
have
a
conversation
with
you
if
it
took
a
to
get
he
says
interrupted
the
proprietress
in
that
he
is
your
she
spoke
quite
distinctly
and
as
these
dreadful
words
through
the
lobby
i
saw
that
two
ladies
had
come
out
from
the
and
were
drinking
the
scene
down
one
of
these
was
the
fat
lady
with
the
three
chins
the
other
was
the
poodle
girl
she
held
him
at
that
unpleasant
moment
by
a
lavender
ribbon
leash
it
seems
she
gets
a
permit
for
him
everywhere
and
he
is
the
wrong
sex
i
am
sure
to
obtain
any
privileges
at
the
the
mosaic
of
that
beautiful
lobby
did
not
open
and
swallow
me
down
as
i
tottered
across
it
to
the
vestibule
a
strapping
guarded
the
entrance
grouped
upon
the
long
flight
of
marble
steps
two
men
impatiently
awaited
me
the
one
with
the
twitching
mustache
was
denbigh
but
he
oh
he
with
the
lightning
in
his
eyes
he
was
my
husband
thomas
price
maria
he
began
with
ominous
composure
if
you
have
any
explanations
to
offer
of
these
extraordinary
circumstances
then
the
torrent
burst
forth
every
expletive
familiar
to
the
wives
of
good
husbands
broke
from
tom
unleashed
lips
i
did
hear
of
it
till
afternoon
i
took
the
midnight
express
billy
told
matilda
he
saw
you
get
aboard
the
train
it
all
over
eastridge
we
have
been
married
thirteen
years
maria
and
i
have
always
had
occasion
to
trust
your
judgment
and
good
sense
till
that
is
precisely
what
i
told
her
ventured
denbigh
as
for
you
sir
tom
price
turned
towering
it
is
fortunate
for
you
that
i
find
my
wife
in
this
darned
any
female
policeman
behind
that
doctor
why
doctor
say
doctor
denbigh
what
in
thunder
are
you
laughing
at
the
doctor
sense
of
humor
a
quality
for
which
i
must
admit
my
dear
husband
is
not
so
distinguished
as
he
is
for
some
more
important
traits
had
got
the
better
of
him
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
threw
back
his
handsome
head
and
then
and
there
in
that
sacred
feminine
vestibule
he
laughed
as
no
woman
could
laugh
if
she
tried
in
the
teeth
of
the
the
clerk
and
the
proprietress
in
the
face
of
the
chin
lady
and
the
poodle
girl
i
ran
straight
to
tom
and
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
at
first
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
push
me
off
but
he
thought
better
of
it
then
i
cried
out
upon
him
as
a
woman
will
when
she
has
had
a
good
scare
oh
tom
tom
tom
you
dear
old
precious
tom
i
told
you
all
about
it
i
wrote
you
a
note
about
denbigh
and
and
everything
you
do
mean
to
say
you
never
found
it
where
the
deuce
did
you
leave
it
demanded
thomas
price
why
i
stuck
it
on
your
i
pinned
it
there
i
pinned
it
down
with
two
i
was
very
particular
exploded
tom
a
message
an
important
message
to
a
man
on
a
then
with
that
admirable
which
has
been
the
secret
of
tom
price
success
in
life
he
immediately
recovered
himself
next
time
maria
he
observed
with
pitying
gentleness
pin
it
on
the
or
paste
it
on
the
haymow
with
the
or
fasten
it
to
the
in
the
square
anywhere
i
might
run
across
doctor
i
beg
your
pardon
old
now
madam
if
you
are
allowed
by
law
to
get
out
of
this
blasted
house
i
ca
get
into
i
will
pay
your
bill
maria
and
take
you
to
a
respectable
hotel
what
that
one
we
used
to
go
to
when
we
ran
down
to
see
irving
i
ca
think
yes
holy
family
do
be
blasphemous
price
whatever
else
you
are
admonished
the
doctor
he
was
choking
with
laughter
perhaps
it
was
whole
family
tom
i
suggested
meekly
come
to
think
of
it
admitted
tom
it
must
have
been
happy
family
get
your
things
on
mysie
and
we
get
out
of
this
inhuman
i
held
my
head
as
high
as
i
could
when
i
came
back
through
the
lobby
with
a
stout
chambermaid
carrying
my
the
clerk
sniffed
audibly
the
proprietress
met
me
with
a
granite
eye
the
lady
with
the
three
chins
muttered
something
which
i
am
convinced
it
would
not
have
added
to
my
personal
happiness
to
hear
but
i
thought
the
girl
with
the
lavender
poodle
watched
me
a
little
wistfully
as
i
whirled
away
upon
my
husband
big
forgiving
arm
the
doctor
who
had
really
laughed
until
he
cried
followed
wiping
his
merry
eyes
these
glistened
when
on
the
sidewalk
directly
opposite
the
hotel
entrance
we
met
elizabeth
talbert
who
had
arranged
but
in
the
agitation
of
the
morning
i
had
entirely
forgotten
it
to
come
to
see
me
at
that
very
hour
so
we
fell
into
line
the
doctor
and
aunt
elizabeth
my
husband
and
i
on
our
way
to
take
the
cars
for
the
happy
family
when
suddenly
tom
clapped
his
hands
to
his
pockets
and
announced
that
he
had
forgotten
he
must
send
a
telegram
coming
away
in
such
a
hurry
he
must
telegraph
to
the
works
tom
is
an
incurable
telegrapher
i
have
long
cherished
the
conviction
that
he
is
the
main
support
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
and
we
all
followed
him
to
the
nearest
office
where
he
could
get
a
wire
some
one
was
before
him
at
the
window
a
person
holding
a
hesitant
pencil
above
a
yellow
blank
i
believe
i
am
not
without
myself
partly
natural
and
partly
acquired
by
living
so
long
with
tom
but
it
took
all
i
ever
had
not
to
utter
a
womanish
cry
when
the
young
man
turned
his
face
and
i
saw
that
it
was
harry
goward
the
boy
glance
swept
us
all
in
when
it
reached
aunt
elizabeth
and
denbigh
he
paled
whether
with
relief
or
regret
i
had
my
doubts
at
that
moment
and
i
have
them
still
an
emotion
of
some
species
possessed
him
so
that
he
could
not
for
the
moment
speak
aunt
elizabeth
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
ah
she
cooed
what
a
happy
accident
goward
allow
me
to
present
you
to
my
friend
the
doctor
bowed
with
a
portentous
gravity
it
was
almost
the
equal
of
harry
own
after
this
satisfactory
incident
everybody
fell
back
instinctively
and
gave
the
command
of
the
expedition
to
me
the
boy
anxiously
yielded
his
place
at
the
telegraph
window
to
tom
in
fact
i
took
the
pains
to
notice
that
harry
telegram
was
not
sent
or
was
deferred
to
a
more
convenient
season
i
invited
him
to
run
over
to
the
happy
family
with
us
and
we
all
fell
into
rank
again
on
the
sidewalk
the
boy
not
without
embarrassment
of
this
i
made
it
my
first
duty
to
relieve
him
we
chatted
of
the
weather
and
the
theatre
and
hotels
when
we
had
walked
a
short
distance
we
met
charles
edward
dawdling
along
over
to
the
sphinx
however
reluctantly
to
call
upon
his
precious
elder
sister
so
we
paired
off
naturally
aunt
elizabeth
and
the
doctor
in
front
goward
and
i
behind
them
and
tom
and
charles
edward
bringing
up
the
rear
my
heart
dropped
when
i
saw
what
a
family
party
air
we
had
i
felt
it
to
my
and
i
could
see
that
the
lad
writhed
under
it
his
expression
changed
from
misery
to
mutiny
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
made
one
plunge
into
the
roaring
current
of
broadway
and
sunk
from
sight
forever
the
thing
that
troubled
me
most
was
the
poor
taste
of
it
as
if
the
whole
family
had
congregated
in
the
metropolis
to
capture
that
unhappy
boy
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
feel
some
sympathy
for
him
mr
goward
i
said
abruptly
in
a
voice
too
low
even
for
aunt
elizabeth
to
hear
nobody
wishes
to
make
you
uncomfortable
we
are
not
here
for
any
such
purpose
i
have
something
in
my
pocket
to
show
you
that
is
all
it
will
interest
you
i
am
sure
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
hotel
if
you
do
mind
i
will
tell
you
about
it
or
in
fact
will
give
it
to
you
count
the
rest
out
they
are
not
in
the
i
feel
like
a
convict
arrested
by
plainclothes
men
complained
harry
glancing
before
and
behind
you
wo
i
said
when
you
have
talked
to
me
five
i
he
asked
dully
he
said
nothing
more
and
we
pursued
our
way
to
the
hotel
in
silence
elizabeth
talbert
and
denbigh
talked
enough
to
make
up
for
us
aunt
elizabeth
made
herself
so
charming
so
acutely
charming
that
i
heard
the
boy
draw
one
quick
sharp
breath
but
his
eyes
followed
her
more
sullenly
than
tenderly
and
when
she
clung
to
the
doctor
arm
upon
a
muddy
crossing
the
young
man
turned
to
me
with
a
sad
whimsical
smile
it
does
seem
to
make
much
difference
does
it
price
she
treats
us
all
there
is
the
prettiest
little
in
the
happy
family
all
blue
and
mahogany
and
quiet
this
place
was
deserted
and
thither
i
betook
myself
with
harry
goward
and
there
he
began
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
well
what
is
it
price
nothing
but
this
i
said
gently
enough
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
solve
a
mystery
that
has
caused
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
our
without
warning
i
took
the
muddy
letter
from
my
pocket
and
slid
it
under
his
eyes
upon
the
big
blue
blotter
i
do
wish
to
be
intrusive
or
strenuous
i
pleaded
none
of
us
wishes
to
be
that
nobody
is
here
to
call
you
to
account
goward
but
you
see
this
letter
it
was
received
at
our
house
in
the
condition
in
which
you
find
it
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
supply
the
missing
address
that
is
all
i
want
of
the
boy
complexion
ran
through
the
palette
and
subsided
from
a
dull
to
a
sickly
has
she
ever
read
it
he
demanded
nobody
has
ever
read
it
i
said
naturally
since
it
is
not
addressed
this
letter
went
fishing
with
the
young
man
took
the
letter
and
examined
it
in
trembling
silence
perhaps
if
fate
ever
broke
him
on
her
wheel
it
was
at
that
moment
his
destiny
was
still
in
his
own
hands
and
so
was
the
letter
unaddressed
it
was
his
personal
property
he
could
retain
it
if
he
chose
and
the
family
mystery
would
darken
into
deeper
gloom
than
ever
i
felt
my
comfortable
commonplace
heart
beat
rapidly
our
silence
had
passed
the
point
of
discomfort
and
was
fast
reaching
that
of
anguish
when
the
boy
lifted
his
head
manfully
dipped
one
of
the
happy
family
new
pens
into
a
stately
and
rapidly
filled
in
the
missing
address
upon
the
unfortunate
letter
he
handed
it
to
me
without
a
word
my
eyes
blurred
when
i
read
personal
miss
peggy
talbert
eastridge
kindness
of
miss
alice
talbert
what
shall
i
do
with
it
i
asked
controlling
my
agitation
deliver
it
to
her
if
you
please
as
quickly
as
possible
i
thought
of
everything
else
i
never
thought
of
never
thought
of
that
she
might
not
have
got
now
then
goward
i
ventured
still
speaking
very
gently
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
took
that
train
for
why
because
i
did
get
an
answer
from
the
letter
exclaimed
harry
raising
his
voice
for
the
first
time
a
man
does
write
a
letter
such
as
that
more
than
once
in
a
lifetime
it
was
a
very
important
letter
i
told
her
everything
i
explained
everything
i
felt
i
ought
to
have
a
hearing
if
she
wanted
to
throw
me
over
i
do
deny
she
had
the
right
to
i
would
rather
she
had
taken
some
other
way
than
than
to
ignore
such
a
letter
i
waited
for
an
answer
to
that
letter
until
five
i
just
caught
the
train
and
went
to
my
aunt
house
the
one
you
know
my
uncle
died
the
other
day
i
have
been
there
ever
since
price
if
anything
else
comes
up
and
if
you
have
any
messages
for
me
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
will
take
my
he
handed
me
his
card
with
an
street
and
number
and
i
snapped
it
into
the
inner
pocket
of
my
wallet
do
you
think
demanded
harry
goward
outright
that
she
will
ever
forgive
me
really
forgive
me
that
is
for
you
to
find
out
i
answered
smiling
comfortably
for
i
could
not
possibly
have
harry
think
that
any
of
us
even
an
unpopular
elder
sister
could
be
there
to
fling
peggy
at
the
young
man
head
that
is
between
you
and
when
shall
you
get
home
with
that
letter
demanded
harry
ask
my
husband
at
a
guess
i
should
say
perhaps
i
had
better
wait
until
she
has
read
the
letter
mused
the
boy
do
you
think
so
price
i
do
think
anything
about
it
i
will
not
take
any
responsibility
about
it
i
have
got
the
letter
officially
addressed
and
there
my
errand
you
see
i
want
to
do
the
best
thing
urged
harry
goward
and
so
much
has
happened
since
i
wrote
that
letter
and
when
you
come
to
think
that
she
has
never
read
it
i
will
mail
it
to
her
i
said
suddenly
i
will
enclose
it
with
a
line
and
get
it
off
by
special
delivery
this
it
might
not
reach
her
suggested
harry
pessimistically
everything
seems
to
go
wrong
in
this
would
you
prefer
to
send
it
yourself
i
asked
harry
goward
shook
his
head
i
would
rather
wait
till
she
has
read
it
i
feel
under
the
circumstances
that
i
owe
that
to
now
at
that
critical
moment
a
wide
figure
darkened
the
entrance
of
the
and
plumping
down
solidly
at
another
table
spread
out
a
fat
hand
and
began
to
write
a
laborious
letter
it
was
the
lady
with
the
three
chins
but
the
girl
with
the
poodle
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
i
learned
afterward
that
the
dog
rule
of
the
happy
family
admitted
of
no
permits
harry
goward
and
i
parted
abruptly
but
pleasantly
and
he
earnestly
requested
the
privilege
of
being
permitted
to
call
upon
me
morning
i
mailed
the
letter
to
peggy
by
special
delivery
and
just
now
i
asked
tom
if
he
did
think
it
was
wise
i
can
tell
you
better
my
dear
day
after
tomorrow
he
replied
and
that
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
him
the
happy
it
is
day
after
tomorrow
and
tom
and
i
are
going
to
take
the
noon
train
home
our
purpose
or
at
least
my
purpose
to
this
effect
has
been
confirmed
if
not
created
by
the
following
circumstances
yesterday
a
few
hours
after
i
had
parted
from
harry
goward
in
the
blue
of
the
happy
family
tom
received
from
father
a
telegram
which
ran
like
this
off
for
washington
that
gooch
business
shall
take
peggy
child
needs
change
will
stop
over
from
colonial
express
and
lunch
happy
family
explicitly
request
no
outsider
present
ca
have
appearance
of
false
position
shall
take
her
directly
out
of
new
york
after
luncheon
cyrus
torn
between
filial
duty
and
sisterly
affection
i
sat
twirling
this
telegram
between
my
troubled
fingers
tom
had
dashed
it
there
and
blown
off
somewhere
leaving
me
as
he
usually
does
to
make
my
own
decisions
should
i
tell
harry
should
i
not
tell
harry
was
it
my
right
was
it
not
his
due
i
vibrated
between
these
inexorable
questions
but
like
the
pendulum
i
was
i
struck
no
answer
anywhere
i
had
half
made
up
my
mind
to
let
matters
take
their
own
course
if
goward
should
happen
to
call
on
me
when
peggy
flying
through
new
york
beneath
her
stalwart
wing
alighted
for
the
instant
at
the
happy
family
was
i
to
blame
could
be
held
responsible
it
struck
me
that
i
could
not
on
the
other
hand
father
could
not
be
more
determined
than
i
that
peggy
should
not
be
put
into
the
apparent
position
of
pursuing
an
irresolute
however
repentant
lover
i
was
still
debating
the
question
as
conscientiously
and
philosophically
as
i
knew
how
when
the
brought
me
a
note
despatched
by
a
district
messenger
and
therefore
constitutionally
delayed
upon
the
way
the
letter
was
from
my
little
sister
fiance
and
briefly
said
my
dear
price
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
thank
you
for
your
sisterly
sympathy
and
womanly
good
sense
you
have
cleared
away
a
lot
of
fog
out
of
my
mind
i
do
feel
that
i
can
wait
an
unnecessary
hour
before
i
see
peggy
i
should
like
to
be
with
her
as
soon
as
the
letter
is
if
you
will
allow
me
to
postpone
my
appointment
with
yourself
i
shall
start
for
eastridge
by
the
first
train
i
can
catch
gratefully
yours
henry
ix
the
mother
by
edith
wyatt
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
surprise
no
mother
of
a
large
family
when
i
say
that
this
hour
is
the
first
one
i
have
spent
alone
for
thirty
years
i
count
it
alone
for
while
i
am
driving
back
in
the
runabout
along
the
six
miles
of
leafy
road
between
the
hospital
and
eastridge
with
mother
beside
me
she
is
sound
asleep
under
the
protection
of
her
little
hinged
black
sunshade
still
held
upright
she
will
sleep
until
we
are
at
home
and
after
our
anxious
morning
at
the
hospital
i
am
most
grateful
to
the
fortune
sending
me
this
lucid
interval
not
only
for
thinking
over
what
has
occurred
in
the
last
three
days
but
also
for
trying
to
focus
clearly
for
myself
what
has
happened
in
the
last
week
since
elizabeth
went
on
the
to
new
york
since
charles
followed
elizabeth
since
maria
under
denbigh
mysteriously
required
escort
followed
charles
since
tom
followed
maria
and
since
cyrus
with
my
dear
girl
followed
tom
on
the
warm
afternoon
before
elizabeth
left
as
i
walked
past
her
open
door
with
lena
and
carrying
an
to
peggy
i
could
not
avoid
hearing
down
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
a
conversation
carried
on
in
clear
absorbed
tones
between
my
sister
and
alice
did
i
understand
you
to
say
said
elizabeth
in
an
assumption
of
indifference
too
elaborate
i
think
to
deceive
even
her
niece
that
this
wilde
you
mention
is
now
living
in
new
york
oh
yes
he
conducts
all
the
at
the
crafts
settlement
he
encouraged
lorraine
sisters
in
their
wonderful
work
i
would
love
to
go
into
it
lorraine
sisters
and
her
circle
once
entertained
me
at
tea
in
their
establishment
when
i
visited
charles
before
his
marriage
in
new
york
they
are
extremely
kind
young
women
ladies
in
every
respect
who
have
a
workshop
called
at
the
sign
of
the
they
seem
to
be
carpenters
as
nearly
as
i
can
tell
they
wear
fillets
and
bright
loose
clothes
and
they
make
very
footstools
and
odd
settees
with
pieces
of
glass
set
about
in
them
it
is
all
very
puzzling
when
charles
showed
me
a
candlestick
one
of
the
young
ladies
had
made
and
talked
to
me
about
the
decoration
and
the
line
i
could
see
that
it
was
very
gracefully
designed
and
nicely
put
together
but
when
he
noticed
that
in
the
wish
to
be
perfectly
to
his
point
of
view
i
was
looking
very
attentively
at
a
queer
uneven
brooch
with
two
little
pendant
polished
granite
rocks
he
only
laughed
and
put
his
hand
on
my
shawl
a
minute
and
brought
me
more
tea
so
that
i
could
understand
something
of
what
alice
was
mentioning
as
she
went
on
you
know
lorraine
says
that
though
not
the
most
prominent
lyman
wilde
is
the
most
radical
and
temperamental
leader
in
the
great
handicraft
development
in
this
country
even
most
of
the
persons
in
favor
of
it
consider
that
he
goes
too
far
she
says
for
instance
he
is
so
opposed
to
machines
of
all
sorts
that
he
thinks
it
would
be
better
to
abolish
printing
and
return
to
script
he
has
started
what
they
call
a
little
movement
of
the
kind
now
and
is
training
two
young
elizabeth
was
shaking
her
head
reflectively
as
i
passed
the
door
and
saying
ah
no
compromise
and
always
always
the
love
of
and
i
heard
her
advising
alice
never
never
to
be
one
of
the
foolish
women
and
men
who
hurt
themselves
by
dreaming
of
beauty
or
happiness
in
their
narrow
little
lives
repeating
sagely
that
this
dream
was
even
worse
for
the
women
than
for
the
men
and
asked
whether
alice
supposed
the
crafts
settlement
address
would
probably
be
in
the
new
york
alice
seemed
to
be
spending
a
very
gratifying
afternoon
my
sister
elizabeth
strongest
instinct
from
her
early
youth
has
been
the
passion
inspiring
the
famous
captain
parklebury
todd
so
often
quoted
by
alice
and
billy
i
do
not
think
i
ever
knew
a
character
so
given
to
creating
a
sensation
or
i
should
in
justice
say
to
what
in
an
adelphi
play
is
known
as
never
has
she
gratified
her
taste
in
this
respect
more
fully
than
she
did
as
i
believe
quite
accidentally
and
on
the
inspiration
of
these
words
with
alice
in
taking
the
evening
train
to
new
york
with
goward
twenty
or
thirty
people
at
the
station
saw
them
starting
away
together
each
attempting
to
avoid
recognition
each
in
the
pretence
of
avoiding
the
other
each
with
excited
manners
so
that
as
both
peggy
and
elizabeth
have
been
born
and
brought
up
here
as
during
conspicuous
absence
and
silence
during
peggy
illness
and
all
our
trying
uncertainties
and
hers
in
the
last
weeks
my
sister
had
widely
flung
to
town
talk
many
tacit
insinuations
concerning
the
character
of
goward
interest
in
herself
as
none
of
the
twenty
or
thirty
people
were
mute
beyond
their
kind
and
as
elizabeth
nature
has
never
inspired
high
neighborly
confidence
before
night
a
rumor
had
spread
like
the
wind
that
margaret
talbert
lover
had
eloped
with
her
aunt
billy
heard
the
other
children
talking
of
this
news
and
hushing
themselves
when
he
came
up
tom
learned
of
the
occurrence
by
a
telephone
and
after
supper
told
cyrus
and
myself
maria
was
informed
of
it
by
telephone
through
an
old
friend
who
thought
maria
should
know
of
what
every
one
was
saying
lorraine
walking
to
the
office
to
meet
charles
was
overtaken
on
the
street
by
temple
greatly
concerned
for
us
and
for
peggy
and
learned
the
strange
story
from
our
sympathetic
neighbor
to
repeat
it
to
charles
at
ten
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
house
perhaps
in
eastridge
who
was
ignorant
of
our
daughter
singular
fortune
that
person
was
our
dear
girl
herself
since
my
own
intelligence
of
the
report
i
had
not
left
her
alone
with
anybody
else
for
a
moment
and
now
i
was
standing
in
the
hall
watching
her
start
safely
when
to
our
surprise
the
latch
clicked
suddenly
she
turned
on
the
stairs
the
door
opened
and
we
both
faced
charles
from
the
first
still
glances
he
and
i
gave
each
other
he
knew
she
had
heard
then
he
said
quietly
that
he
had
wished
to
see
peggy
for
a
moment
before
she
went
to
sleep
he
bade
me
a
very
confiding
and
responsible
and
went
out
with
her
to
the
garden
where
they
used
to
play
constantly
together
when
they
were
children
unable
to
lie
down
till
she
came
back
i
put
on
a
little
cambric
sack
and
sat
by
the
window
waiting
till
i
should
hear
her
foot
on
the
stairs
again
charles
is
telling
her
i
said
to
cyrus
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
dumb
with
impatience
and
disgust
too
pained
for
peggy
too
tried
by
his
own
helplessness
to
rest
or
even
to
sit
still
in
a
way
it
has
all
been
harder
for
him
than
for
any
one
else
his
impulses
are
stronger
and
deeper
than
my
dear
girl
and
far
less
cool
she
is
very
especially
precious
to
him
and
whether
because
she
looks
so
like
him
or
because
he
thinks
her
ways
like
my
own
her
youth
and
her
fortune
have
always
been
at
once
a
more
anxious
and
a
more
lovely
concern
with
him
than
any
one
else
on
earth
she
is
somehow
our
future
to
him
while
we
waited
here
in
this
anxiety
down
in
the
garden
i
could
hear
not
the
words
but
the
tones
of
our
children
as
they
spoke
together
charles
voice
sounded
first
for
a
long
time
with
an
air
of
calmness
and
directness
and
peggy
answered
him
at
intervals
of
listening
answered
apparently
less
with
surprise
at
what
he
told
her
than
in
a
quiet
acceptance
with
a
little
throb
of
control
and
then
in
accord
with
him
then
it
was
as
though
they
were
planning
together
in
the
still
village
night
their
voices
sounded
very
tranquil
after
a
little
while
even
buoyant
peggy
laughed
once
or
twice
little
by
little
a
breath
of
relief
blew
over
both
her
father
solicitude
and
mine
it
was
partly
from
the
coolness
and
freshness
of
the
air
and
the
sense
it
often
brings
that
beyond
whatever
care
is
close
beside
you
at
the
instant
there
is
and
especially
for
the
young
so
much
else
in
all
creation
then
for
me
there
was
a
deep
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
in
this
time
of
need
my
children
had
each
other
that
they
could
speak
so
together
in
an
intimate
sympathy
and
were
not
only
superficially
in
name
but
really
and
beautifully
a
brother
and
sister
at
last
as
they
parted
at
the
gate
charles
said
in
a
spirited
downright
tone
stick
to
that
cling
to
it
make
it
your
answer
to
everything
it
all
you
now
know
and
all
you
need
to
know
and
be
as
firm
on
it
as
on
a
the
lamplight
from
the
street
filtering
through
the
elm
leaves
glimmered
on
peggy
bright
hair
as
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyelashes
were
wet
but
she
was
laughing
as
she
said
but
of
course
i
have
to
cling
to
it
it
the
truth
and
her
step
on
the
stairs
was
light
and
even
skipping
on
the
next
morning
when
i
knocked
at
her
door
to
find
whether
she
would
rather
breakfast
i
saw
at
once
she
had
slept
she
stood
before
the
mirror
fastening
her
belt
ribbon
and
looking
so
lovely
it
seemed
impossible
misfortune
should
ever
touch
her
why
mother
dear
you
are
dressed
for
the
meeting
is
that
this
morning
she
looked
at
me
with
her
little
sweet
quick
smile
and
we
sat
down
for
a
moment
on
her
couch
together
each
with
a
sense
that
neither
would
say
one
word
too
sharply
pressing
dear
mother
why
not
go
to
the
board
meeting
you
do
need
to
protect
me
so
you
ca
protect
me
every
minute
you
see
of
course
last
night
charles
told
me
of
what
everybody
her
voice
throbbed
again
she
stopped
for
a
minute
but
for
weeks
and
weeks
i
had
felt
something
like
this
coming
toward
me
and
now
that
it
come
she
went
on
bravely
we
can
only
just
do
as
we
always
have
done
and
not
make
any
difference
can
we
except
that
i
feel
i
must
be
here
because
we
ca
know
from
minute
to
minute
what
may
come
you
feel
you
ca
leave
me
mother
but
you
can
i
want
to
see
whoever
comes
just
as
usual
i
have
to
at
some
time
you
know
at
any
rate
and
i
mean
to
do
it
now
until
i
go
away
out
of
eastridge
charles
is
going
to
arrange
that
so
very
wonderfully
he
has
gone
to
new
york
now
to
see
about
he
has
my
dear
i
said
in
some
surprise
yes
and
mother
about
about
what
over
she
whispered
oh
just
just
it
could
all
have
happened
in
this
way
if
she
spoke
in
quite
a
clear
soft
voice
looking
straight
into
my
eyes
with
one
of
her
quick
turns
he
were
a
real
man
anybody
i
could
think
of
as
being
my
husband
it
was
just
that
i
did
truly
know
him
that
was
we
held
each
other
hands
fast
for
one
moment
of
perfect
understanding
before
we
rose
then
i
go
dear
this
morning
just
as
you
like
i
said
she
came
into
my
room
and
fastened
my
for
me
why
mother
i
believe
you
and
your
little
duchesse
cuffs
and
your
little
fine
gold
have
ever
been
away
from
the
chair
of
the
library
committee
at
a
board
meeting
for
twenty
years
just
think
what
a
sensation
you
were
going
to
make
if
i
had
interfered
there
how
nice
you
look
the
weather
was
so
inclement
during
my
absence
that
i
felt
quite
secure
concerning
all
intrusion
for
her
at
noon
the
storm
rose
high
with
a
thunder
and
lightning
the
episcopal
church
spire
was
struck
two
trees
were
blown
over
in
the
square
and
instead
of
ordering
dan
and
the
horses
out
in
this
tumult
i
dined
with
a
board
member
living
next
the
library
and
drove
home
at
three
when
the
violence
of
the
gale
had
abated
the
house
was
perfectly
still
when
i
reached
it
the
children
were
at
school
cyrus
at
the
factory
mother
napping
with
her
door
closed
in
her
own
room
in
the
middle
of
the
house
peggy
sat
alone
in
a
loose
wrapper
with
her
hair
flying
over
her
shoulders
an
open
book
lay
unnoticed
in
her
lap
her
face
was
white
and
and
her
eyes
looked
wild
and
as
her
glance
fell
on
me
i
saw
her
need
of
me
and
hurried
in
to
close
the
door
oh
mother
mother
she
moaned
such
a
morning
it
all
come
back
all
i
fought
against
all
i
was
conquering
what
does
it
mean
what
does
it
mean
what
has
happened
who
has
been
here
maria
sneering
at
charles
ideas
asking
me
questions
petting
me
and
pitying
me
and
making
a
baby
of
me
until
i
broke
down
at
last
and
wanted
all
the
things
she
wanted
to
have
done
and
let
her
kiss
me
for
her
kindness
in
doing
them
in
a
passion
of
tears
she
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
room
as
her
father
does
except
with
that
quick
nervous
grace
she
always
has
and
in
a
painful
sobbing
excitement
every
sense
i
had
was
for
an
instant
passage
fused
in
one
clear
concentrated
anger
against
a
sister
who
could
play
so
ruthlessly
upon
my
poor
child
woman
pulses
and
emotions
so
disarm
her
of
her
and
right
free
spirit
why
did
she
come
i
said
at
last
with
the
best
calmness
i
could
muster
peggy
stood
still
for
a
moment
startled
by
a
coldness
in
my
voice
i
could
alter
she
came
to
find
out
about
things
for
herself
then
when
she
did
find
out
about
charles
way
of
helping
us
she
simply
hated
it
and
she
sent
me
after
after
the
letter
you
had
i
got
it
from
your
desk
and
maria
took
it
to
find
out
its
real
at
that
she
sank
again
in
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
saying
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
repeated
softly
and
wildly
yesterday
i
could
behave
so
well
by
what
i
knew
was
true
about
him
then
when
maria
came
and
spoke
as
though
i
was
three
years
old
and
had
any
understanding
nor
any
dignity
of
my
own
and
the
best
thing
for
any
girl
at
any
rate
were
to
cling
to
the
man
she
loved
as
though
she
were
his
mother
and
he
were
her
dear
erring
child
she
began
to
laugh
a
little
the
feebler
he
were
the
more
credit
to
her
for
her
devotion
then
i
could
go
on
by
what
i
knew
was
true
about
him
only
back
back
again
to
all
my
old
she
was
laughing
and
crying
now
with
little
quick
gasps
in
a
sheer
hysteria
which
no
doubt
would
have
given
her
sister
entire
satisfaction
as
a
manifesto
of
her
normal
womanliness
i
brought
her
a
glass
of
water
and
trying
to
conceal
my
own
distress
for
her
as
well
as
i
could
sat
down
silently
near
her
gradually
she
grew
quieter
until
the
room
was
so
still
that
we
could
hear
the
raindrops
from
the
eaves
plash
down
outside
peggy
pushed
back
her
cloud
of
bright
hair
and
fastened
it
in
the
nape
of
her
neck
at
last
she
said
with
conviction
mother
maria
did
say
these
things
but
i
know
she
thinks
them
for
me
thinks
that
a
woman
love
is
just
all
forgiveness
and
indulgence
by
that
she
could
she
did
work
on
my
nerves
but
and
her
gray
eyes
glanced
so
beautifully
and
so
darkly
with
a
girl
fine
straight
native
healthy
spirit
as
she
said
it
i
could
marry
any
man
but
one
that
i
i
sure
you
could
i
said
firmly
and
my
dear
child
i
must
confess
i
fail
to
understand
why
your
sister
should
wish
so
patronizingly
for
you
a
fortune
she
would
never
have
accepted
for
herself
how
can
she
possibly
like
for
you
such
a
mawkish
and
a
morbid
thing
as
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
with
a
man
in
whom
neither
you
nor
any
other
person
feels
the
presence
of
one
single
absolute
and
manly
quality
why
mother
i
have
never
heard
you
speak
so
strongly
before
at
that
moment
lena
came
searching
through
the
hall
and
knocking
at
the
door
of
my
room
next
peggy
to
announce
lorraine
the
girl
was
with
us
constantly
and
of
the
greatest
unobtrusive
solace
to
peggy
in
those
three
days
after
our
travellers
had
all
gone
one
after
the
other
like
the
family
at
the
chance
word
of
clever
alice
it
was
on
the
fifth
morning
afterward
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
piazza
hemming
an
organdie
ruffle
for
my
big
little
girl
she
does
shoot
up
so
fast
that
i
heard
on
the
gravel
charles
footstep
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
as
he
sat
with
his
hat
thrown
off
talking
lightly
of
his
new
york
sojourn
i
was
so
completely
glad
to
see
him
and
to
see
him
looking
so
well
and
in
such
buoyant
spirits
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
until
he
mentioned
taking
tea
at
the
sign
of
the
stool
with
lorraine
sisters
with
lyman
wilde
and
with
aunt
elizabeth
my
work
dropped
out
of
my
hands
he
laughed
yes
dear
mother
since
you
never
have
seen
him
i
know
that
i
can
hope
to
convey
any
right
conception
of
wilde
truly
remarkable
character
he
is
to
begin
with
the
best
of
men
picture
if
you
can
a
nature
with
a
soul
completely
beautiful
and
selfless
and
a
nervous
surface
quite
as
pachydermatous
and
indiscriminating
as
that
of
an
ox
wilde
accepts
everybody
estimate
of
himself
not
only
the
quality
of
his
mercy
but
also
of
his
admiration
is
quite
unstrained
so
that
he
sees
the
friend
of
his
youth
not
at
all
as
i
or
any
humanized
perception
at
the
crafts
settlement
would
see
her
but
quite
as
she
sees
herself
as
a
fascinating
gifted
capricious
woman
of
the
world
beating
the
wings
of
her
thwarted
love
of
beauty
against
cruel
circumstance
i
noticed
his
attitude
as
soon
as
i
mentioned
to
him
that
lorraine
had
by
chance
discovered
that
he
and
my
aunt
were
old
acquaintances
he
said
that
he
would
be
very
much
interested
in
seeing
her
again
as
he
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
looking
over
a
packet
of
postals
announcing
his
series
of
talks
on
he
asked
me
her
address
called
his
stenographer
and
had
it
added
to
his
but
before
the
postal
reached
her
she
had
called
him
up
to
tell
him
she
had
lately
heard
of
his
work
and
of
him
for
the
first
time
after
all
these
years
through
lorraine
and
to
ask
him
to
come
to
see
her
his
call
i
am
sure
they
spent
in
a
rich
mutual
misunderstanding
as
thoroughly
satisfactory
to
both
as
any
one
could
wish
for
as
i
say
on
my
last
visit
in
the
crafts
neighborhood
she
was
taking
tea
with
all
of
them
and
dr
denbigh
i
repeated
in
surprise
oh
charles
are
any
of
them
not
well
no
no
i
think
he
been
in
new
york
he
gave
a
groan
on
account
of
some
delicate
finesse
on
maria
part
some
incomprehensible
plan
of
hers
for
bringing
goward
back
here
the
worst
of
it
is
that
like
all
her
plans
i
believe
it
going
to
be
perfectly
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
in
consternation
from
every
natural
portent
i
think
that
horrid
infant
in
arms
was
when
i
left
new
york
about
to
cast
his
handkerchief
or
rattle
toward
peggy
again
i
morally
certain
that
he
and
all
his
odious
emotional
disturbances
will
be
presenting
themselves
for
her
consideration
in
eastridge
before
long
and
since
they
strike
me
as
quite
too
odious
for
the
nicest
girl
in
the
world
i
hope
before
they
reach
here
she
be
far
away
absolutely
out
of
i
hope
so
but
as
i
said
it
for
the
first
time
there
came
around
me
like
a
blank
rising
mist
the
prospect
of
a
journey
farther
and
a
longer
separation
than
any
i
had
before
imagined
between
us
i
knew
you
think
so
that
was
partly
why
i
acted
as
i
did
for
her
dear
mother
he
leaned
forward
a
little
toward
me
and
took
up
one
end
of
the
ruffle
i
was
stitching
again
to
cover
my
excitement
and
for
lorraine
and
for
me
in
engaging
our
passage
he
seemed
not
to
expect
me
to
speak
at
once
but
after
a
little
quiet
pause
while
we
both
sat
thinking
went
on
with
great
gentleness
you
know
it
about
our
only
way
of
really
protecting
her
from
any
annoyance
here
even
that
of
thoughts
of
her
own
she
does
like
there
will
be
so
very
wonderfully
much
for
her
to
see
and
i
believe
she
enjoy
it
one
of
lorraine
younger
sisters
is
coming
to
be
with
us
perhaps
for
a
while
in
switzerland
and
the
elliots
animal
sculptors
you
remember
them
do
you
and
arlington
studying
decorative
design
that
winter
when
you
were
in
new
york
they
be
abroad
this
summer
i
believe
we
all
have
a
very
charming
time
walking
and
sketching
and
working
a
time
really
so
much
more
charming
for
a
lovely
and
sensible
young
woman
than
sitting
in
a
talking
town
subject
to
the
incursions
of
a
lover
she
does
truly
he
stopped
a
moment
before
he
added
sincerely
then
it
is
simply
for
her
that
this
way
would
be
better
mother
but
for
me
for
every
for
you
and
for
every
one
i
managed
to
make
myself
ask
with
tranquillity
yes
why
would
this
relieve
immensely
all
the
sufferers
from
my
commercial
career
at
the
factory
do
you
think
that
somewhat
unjust
not
simply
to
maria
and
tom
requirements
for
the
family
standing
and
fortunes
he
laughed
a
moment
but
to
father
need
there
of
a
business
man
that
was
his
way
of
putting
it
for
a
long
time
he
pursued
more
earnestly
than
i
ever
heard
him
speak
before
in
his
life
i
been
planning
mother
to
go
away
to
study
and
to
sketch
i
doing
nothing
here
maybe
what
i
would
do
away
from
here
might
not
seem
to
you
so
wonderful
but
it
would
have
one
dignity
whatever
else
it
were
or
were
not
it
would
be
my
perhaps
it
may
seem
strange
but
in
those
few
words
and
instants
when
my
son
spoke
so
simply
and
sincerely
of
his
own
work
i
felt
more
than
in
his
actual
wedding
with
his
wife
the
cleaving
pang
of
a
marriage
for
him
at
the
same
time
i
was
stricken
beyond
all
possible
speech
by
my
rising
consciousness
of
the
injustice
of
his
sense
of
failure
here
in
his
own
father
house
in
my
house
how
weakly
i
had
been
lost
in
the
thousand
little
anxieties
and
preoccupations
of
my
to
let
myself
be
unwittingly
engulfed
in
his
older
sister
strange
blank
prejudice
to
lose
my
own
true
understanding
of
the
rights
and
the
happiness
of
one
of
the
children
i
can
think
it
all
unspoken
and
in
silence
somehow
most
my
own
it
seemed
as
though
my
heartstrings
tightened
everything
blurred
before
me
i
never
in
my
life
have
tried
so
hard
before
to
hold
my
soul
absolutely
still
to
see
quite
clearly
as
though
none
of
this
were
happening
to
myself
what
would
be
best
for
my
boy
future
for
peggy
for
their
whole
lives
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
that
i
heard
him
saying
so
that
perhaps
this
would
truly
be
the
right
way
for
every
only
too
inevitably
i
knew
his
words
were
true
and
now
i
could
force
myself
at
last
to
say
quietly
why
yes
if
that
would
make
you
happier
he
rose
and
came
up
to
my
chair
then
so
beautifully
and
moved
it
to
a
shadier
place
as
peggy
catching
sight
of
him
from
the
garden
ran
up
with
a
cry
of
surprise
to
meet
him
to
talk
about
it
all
i
scarcely
know
whether
her
father
consciousness
of
the
coming
separation
for
me
or
my
consciousness
of
the
coming
separation
for
him
made
things
harder
or
easier
for
both
of
us
cyrus
was
obliged
to
make
a
business
trip
to
washington
on
the
next
day
and
it
was
decided
that
as
peggy
especially
wished
to
be
with
him
now
before
her
long
absence
she
should
accompany
him
in
the
morning
on
the
midnight
before
we
were
all
startled
from
sleep
by
the
clang
of
the
good
little
billy
always
hoping
for
excitement
and
besides
extremely
sweet
in
doing
errands
answered
it
the
rest
of
us
absurdly
assembled
in
kimonos
and
bathrobes
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
dreading
we
scarcely
knew
what
for
the
members
of
the
family
not
in
the
house
within
a
few
minutes
billy
dashed
again
considerately
holding
high
so
that
we
all
could
see
it
a
letter
the
very
same
illegible
bleared
envelope
which
had
before
annoyed
us
so
extremely
it
was
addressed
in
characters
to
miss
talbert
the
word
peggy
very
clear
and
black
had
been
lately
inserted
in
the
same
handwriting
and
below
the
street
and
number
had
been
recently
refreshed
apparently
by
the
hand
of
maria
as
this
familiar
wearisome
object
reappeared
before
us
all
peggy
with
a
little
quiver
of
mirth
looking
out
between
her
long
braids
cried
call
back
the
boy
by
the
time
the
messenger
had
returned
she
had
readdressed
the
envelope
unopened
to
goward
billy
took
it
back
again
and
every
one
trooped
off
to
bed
alice
and
mother
with
positive
snorts
and
flounces
of
impatience
needless
to
say
tom
and
maria
returned
in
perfect
safety
on
saturday
before
then
at
twelve
on
the
same
morning
when
cyrus
and
peggy
had
gone
i
was
sitting
on
the
piazza
making
a
little
for
her
with
mother
sitting
rocking
beside
me
and
complaining
of
every
one
in
peace
when
denbigh
drove
up
to
the
flung
his
weight
out
of
the
buggy
and
hurried
up
the
steps
he
shook
hands
with
us
hastily
and
abstractedly
and
asked
if
he
might
speak
to
me
inside
the
house
mrs
talbert
he
said
closing
the
door
of
the
library
as
soon
as
we
were
inside
it
i
am
sure
you
will
try
not
to
feel
alarmed
at
something
i
must
tell
you
of
at
once
the
early
morning
train
i
came
on
from
new
york
the
one
that
ought
to
get
in
at
eastridge
at
eleven
was
derailed
two
hours
ago
on
a
misplaced
switch
between
here
and
whitman
no
one
was
killed
but
many
of
the
passengers
were
injured
among
the
injured
i
took
care
of
was
goward
his
arm
has
been
broken
he
been
badly
shaken
up
and
he
now
in
a
state
of
shock
at
the
whitman
hospital
the
boy
has
been
asking
for
peggy
and
then
for
you
i
promised
him
that
after
my
work
was
done
all
the
injured
were
taken
there
by
a
special
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
wreck
i
ask
you
to
drive
back
to
see
him
will
you
come
of
course
i
went
then
and
at
harry
goward
request
i
have
gone
twice
since
he
is
very
ill
too
ill
to
talk
and
though
denbigh
says
he
will
outlive
a
thousand
stronger
men
he
has
been
rather
worse
this
morning
when
i
first
saw
him
he
asked
for
peggy
in
one
gasping
word
and
when
he
learned
she
had
gone
to
washington
turned
even
whiter
than
he
had
been
before
he
is
nervously
quite
wrecked
and
wretched
has
no
confidence
in
denbigh
and
either
maria
or
i
will
go
to
the
hospital
every
day
till
the
boy
mother
comes
from
california
it
is
a
very
trying
situation
for
his
misfortune
has
of
course
not
changed
my
knowledge
of
his
nature
i
dread
telling
cyrus
and
peggy
when
i
meet
their
returning
noon
train
after
i
have
left
mother
at
home
of
everything
that
has
happened
here
as
though
these
difficulties
were
not
enough
this
morning
just
before
we
started
to
whitman
we
were
involved
in
another
perplexity
through
the
unwilling
agency
of
temple
he
called
me
up
to
read
me
a
bewildering
telegram
he
had
received
an
hour
before
from
elizabeth
it
said
please
end
eastridge
scandal
by
announcing
my
engagement
in
engagement
to
whom
temple
had
asked
by
telephone
of
charles
who
said
none
of
us
could
be
responsible
for
any
definite
information
in
the
matter
unless
perhaps
maria
on
consultation
maria
had
said
to
temple
that
in
new
york
goward
had
imparted
to
her
that
elizabeth
had
told
him
many
weeks
ago
that
she
was
irrevocably
betrothed
to
denbigh
temple
had
finally
referred
unsuccessfully
to
me
for
elizabeth
address
in
order
to
ask
her
to
send
a
complete
announcement
in
the
full
form
she
wished
printed
whoa

the
kind
new
the
puppy
chewed
my
other
golly
i
forgot
i
suppose
i
must
use
this
but
it
my
birthday
next
month
and
i
want
things
and
i
thought
i
better
make
a
list
to
pin
on
the
door
where
the
family
could
take
their
pick
what
to
give
me
lorraine
gave
me
this
and
told
me
that
if
write
down
everything
that
i
knew
about
peggy
and
harry
goward
and
all
that
stuff
she
have
sally
make
me
three
pounds
of
crumbly
cookies
with
currants
on
top
in
a
box
to
keep
in
my
room
just
to
eat
myself
and
she
would
tell
alice
so
i
wo
be
selfish
not
to
offer
her
any
as
she
wo
know
about
it
and
so
wo
suffer
i
going
to
keep
them
in
the
extra
bureau
drawer
where
peg
puts
her
best
party
dress
so
i
guess
they
be
et
up
before
anybody
goes
there
peggy
feeling
pretty
sick
now
to
dress
up
for
parties
but
i
know
a
thing
or
two
that
the
rest
do
know
would
alice
be
hopping
she
always
thinks
she
wise
to
everything
and
to
have
a
know
a
whacking
secret
that
they
all
be
excited
about
would
make
her
mad
enough
to
burst
she
thinks
she
can
read
my
ingrown
soul
too
but
i
rather
think
i
have
my
own
interior
thoughts
that
miss
alice
does
tumble
to
for
instance
denbigh
golly
i
forgot
lorraine
said
she
cut
down
the
cookies
if
things
were
told
orderly
the
way
they
happened
so
i
got
to
begin
back
first
then
i
had
the
best
time
since
peggy
got
engaged
that
ever
had
in
my
own
home
not
quite
as
unbossed
as
when
they
sent
me
on
the
harris
farm
last
summer
and
i
slept
in
the
stable
if
i
wanted
to
and
nobody
asked
if
i
taken
a
bath
that
was
a
sensible
way
to
live
but
yet
it
been
unpecked
at
and
pleasant
even
at
home
lately
you
see
with
such
a
lot
of
fussing
about
peggy
and
harry
goward
nobody
has
noticed
what
i
did
and
that
to
a
person
with
a
taste
for
animals
is
one
of
the
best
states
of
living
i
gone
to
the
table
without
brushing
my
hair
and
the
puppy
has
slept
in
my
bed
and
i
kept
a
toad
behind
the
for
two
weeks
and
though
lena
the
maid
knew
about
it
she
shut
up
and
was
decent
because
she
did
want
to
worry
mother
a
toad
is
such
an
unusual
creature
to
live
with
i
got
a
string
to
his
hind
leg
but
yet
he
gets
into
places
where
you
expect
him
and
it
very
interesting
lena
seemed
to
think
it
nice
to
have
him
in
the
towels
in
the
drawer
but
i
care
it
does
hurt
the
towels
and
it
cosey
for
the
toad
i
had
a
little
snake
a
stunner
but
lena
squealed
when
she
found
him
in
my
collars
so
i
had
to
take
him
away
he
looked
awfully
cunning
inside
the
collars
but
lena
would
stand
for
him
so
i
let
well
enough
alone
and
tried
to
be
contented
with
the
toad
and
the
puppy
and
some
i
got
in
boxes
in
the
closet
and
my
lizard
next
to
mother
my
best
friend
i
had
him
six
months
i
not
sure
i
would
rather
lose
mother
than
him
because
you
can
get
a
but
awfully
difficult
to
replace
a
lizard
like
diogenes
i
wonder
if
lorraine
will
think
i
written
too
much
about
my
animals
more
fun
than
peggy
anyway
and
as
for
harry
goward
golly
the
toad
or
lizard
that
could
be
livelier
than
he
is
would
be
a
pretty
sad
animal
a
year
ago
i
was
fishing
one
day
away
up
the
river
squatting
under
a
bush
on
a
bank
when
peggy
and
denbigh
came
and
plumped
right
over
my
head
they
did
see
me
but
it
was
up
to
me
they
were
looking
the
other
way
so
they
did
notice
my
either
they
noticing
much
of
life
as
it
appeared
to
me
except
their
personal
selves
i
thought
if
they
would
disturb
me
i
would
disturb
them
at
first
i
did
pay
attention
to
what
they
were
saying
because
there
was
a
chub
and
a
trout
together
after
my
bait
and
i
naturally
was
excited
to
see
if
the
trout
would
take
it
but
when
i
lost
both
of
them
i
had
time
to
listen
i
would
have
believed
it
of
denbigh
to
bother
about
a
girl
like
peg
who
ca
do
anything
and
he
a
whale
just
a
whale
he
six
and
strong
as
an
ox
he
went
through
west
point
before
he
degraded
himself
into
a
doctor
and
he
held
the
record
there
for
and
was
on
the
team
and
even
now
when
very
old
and
of
course
ca
last
long
he
plays
the
best
tennis
in
eastridge
he
went
to
the
spanish
war
quite
awhile
ago
that
was
but
yet
in
modern
times
and
he
was
at
san
juan
you
can
see
he
a
jim
dandy
and
him
to
be
wasting
time
on
peggy
it
sickening
even
for
a
girl
she
poor
stuff
i
do
mean
of
course
that
she
not
all
right
in
a
moral
direction
and
i
would
let
anybody
else
abuse
her
everybody
says
she
pretty
and
i
suppose
she
is
in
a
way
and
she
awfully
kind
you
know
but
athletically
that
what
talking
about
she
does
amount
to
a
row
of
pins
she
ca
fish
or
play
tennis
or
ride
or
anything
yet
all
the
same
it
true
i
distinctly
heard
him
say
he
loved
her
better
than
anything
on
earth
i
do
think
he
could
have
meant
better
than
rapscallion
he
awfully
fond
of
that
horse
probably
he
forgot
rapscallion
for
the
moment
anyhow
peg
was
sniffling
and
saying
how
she
was
going
back
to
college
it
was
the
easter
vacation
and
how
she
was
only
a
stupid
girl
and
he
would
forget
her
and
he
said
he
never
forget
her
one
minute
all
his
life
which
was
silly
for
i
often
forgotten
really
important
things
once
i
forgot
to
stop
at
for
a
tin
of
hot
gingerbread
she
had
sally
make
for
me
to
entirely
eat
by
myself
and
alice
got
it
and
devoured
it
all
up
the
pig
anyway
denbigh
said
that
and
then
peggy
sniffled
some
more
and
i
heard
him
ask
her
what
is
it
dear
dear
your
grandmother
she
said
then
why
would
he
let
her
be
engaged
to
him
like
anybody
else
and
it
was
hard
on
a
girl
to
have
to
beg
a
man
to
be
engaged
and
then
he
laughed
a
little
and
they
either
of
them
say
anything
for
a
while
but
there
were
soft
rustling
sounds
a
trout
was
after
my
bait
so
i
did
listen
carefully
when
i
noticed
again
denbigh
was
saying
how
he
was
years
and
years
older
and
it
was
his
duty
to
take
care
of
her
and
not
allow
her
to
make
a
mistake
that
might
ruin
her
life
and
he
would
let
her
hurry
into
a
thing
she
could
get
out
of
and
a
lot
more
peg
said
that
forty
was
old
and
he
was
young
enough
for
her
and
she
was
certain
certain
i
do
know
what
she
was
certain
of
but
she
was
horribly
obstinate
about
it
and
then
denbigh
said
if
i
only
dared
let
you
dear
if
i
only
and
something
about
if
she
felt
the
same
in
two
years
or
a
year
or
something
i
ca
remember
all
that
truck
and
they
said
the
same
thing
over
a
lot
i
heard
him
murmur
call
me
jack
just
and
she
murmured
back
as
if
it
was
a
stunt
jack
and
then
rustlings
i
call
him
jack
all
the
afternoon
if
he
liked
then
after
another
of
those
still
games
peggy
said
ow
as
if
somebody
pinched
her
and
that
seemed
such
a
queer
remark
that
i
stood
up
to
see
what
they
were
up
to
getting
to
my
feet
i
swung
the
line
around
and
the
bait
flopped
up
the
bank
and
hit
peg
square
in
the
mouth
i
give
you
my
word
i
did
mean
to
but
it
was
awfully
funny
my
did
she
squeal
bloody
murder
that
what
makes
a
person
despise
peggy
she
no
sort
of
sport
another
time
i
remember
i
had
some
worms
in
an
envelope
and
i
happened
to
feel
them
in
my
pocket
so
i
pulled
out
one
and
slid
it
down
the
back
of
her
neck
and
you
have
thought
i
done
something
awful
she
yelped
and
wriggled
and
cried
she
did
she
actually
cried
and
you
would
believe
what
she
finished
up
by
doing
she
went
and
took
a
bath
a
whole
bath
when
she
did
have
to
she
ca
see
a
joke
at
all
now
alice
is
a
horrid
meddler
she
and
maria
yet
alice
is
a
sport
and
takes
her
medicine
i
seen
that
girl
with
a
beetle
in
her
hair
which
i
put
there
keep
her
teeth
shut
and
not
make
a
sound
only
a
low
gurgle
until
she
got
him
and
slung
him
out
of
the
window
then
she
lammed
me
i
tell
you
i
respected
her
for
it
too
but
she
could
now
i
stronger
oh
golly
lorraine
will
cut
down
the
cookies
if
i
do
tell
what
happened
i
do
exactly
know
what
was
next
but
denbigh
somehow
had
me
by
the
collar
and
gave
me
a
yank
like
a
big
dog
does
a
little
one
see
here
you
young
limb
he
said
i
i
going
to
and
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
at
peggy
and
began
to
chuckle
and
peggy
laughed
and
turned
lobster
color
and
put
her
face
in
her
hands
and
just
howled
of
course
i
grinned
too
and
then
i
glanced
up
at
him
lovingly
and
murmured
jack
just
like
peggy
did
that
seemed
to
sober
him
and
he
considered
a
minute
listen
billy
he
began
slowly
we
in
your
power
but
i
going
to
trust
i
just
hooted
because
there
was
much
else
he
could
do
but
he
smile
only
his
eyes
sort
of
twinkled
be
calm
my
son
he
said
you
a
gentleman
i
believe
and
all
i
need
do
is
to
point
out
that
what
you
seen
and
heard
is
not
your
secret
i
sure
you
realize
that
it
unnecessary
to
ask
you
not
to
tell
of
course
you
never
tell
one
word
not
one
word
and
he
glared
that
understood
is
it
i
said
yep
sort
of
scared
he
splendidly
big
and
arrogant
and
has
that
look
but
he
a
peach
all
the
same
are
we
friends
and
brothers
he
asked
and
slid
a
look
at
peg
yep
i
said
again
and
i
meant
it
shake
said
denbigh
and
we
shook
like
two
men
that
was
about
all
that
happened
that
day
except
about
my
fishing
there
was
a
very
interesting
but
i
suppose
lorraine
would
care
for
that
it
was
a
good
deal
of
a
strain
on
my
feelings
not
to
tell
alice
but
of
course
i
did
but
once
in
awhile
i
would
glance
up
at
denbigh
trustingly
and
murmur
jack
and
he
would
be
in
a
fit
because
always
do
it
when
the
family
just
barely
could
hear
as
soon
as
peg
came
home
from
college
we
skipped
to
the
mountains
and
she
went
back
from
there
to
college
again
and
i
did
have
a
fair
show
to
get
rises
out
of
them
together
and
in
the
urgency
of
things
like
pigeons
and
the
new
puppy
i
pretty
nearly
forgot
their
love
young
dream
i
did
have
a
surmise
that
i
was
going
to
be
interwoven
among
it
like
i
was
i
saw
aunt
elizabeth
going
out
with
denbigh
in
his
machine
two
or
three
times
but
she
a
regular
fusser
with
men
and
he
got
a
kind
heart
so
i
was
wise
to
anything
in
that
the
day
peg
came
home
for
christmas
she
was
singing
like
the
blue
canaries
down
in
the
parlor
and
i
happened
to
pass
aunt
elizabeth
door
and
she
was
lacing
up
her
shoes
oh
billy
ask
peggy
if
she
does
want
to
go
for
a
walk
will
you
there
a
lamb
she
called
to
me
so
i
happened
to
have
intelligence
from
pristine
sources
that
they
went
walking
and
after
that
peg
had
a
grouch
on
and
was
off
her
feed
the
rest
of
the
vacation
nobody
knew
why
i
did
myself
even
and
it
did
occur
to
me
that
aunt
elizabeth
had
probably
been
rubbing
it
in
how
well
she
knew
denbigh
the
last
day
peggy
was
home
at
the
table
they
were
chaffing
aunt
elizabeth
about
him
the
way
do
instead
of
talking
about
the
facts
of
life
and
different
kinds
of
which
is
important
in
the
winter
and
i
heard
mother
say
in
a
tone
to
peggy
they
really
seem
to
be
fond
of
each
other
perhaps
there
may
be
an
engagement
to
write
you
about
i
thought
to
myself
that
mother
did
know
that
denbigh
was
prejudiced
to
being
engaged
but
i
did
say
anything
it
wise
not
to
say
anything
to
your
family
beyond
the
necessary
jargon
of
living
peggy
seemed
to
think
the
same
for
she
did
answer
a
syllabus
but
after
dropping
her
glass
of
water
into
the
fried
potatoes
which
lena
was
kindly
handing
to
her
she
jumped
and
scooted
a
few
minutes
later
i
wanted
her
to
sew
a
sail
on
a
boat
so
i
tried
her
door
and
it
was
locked
and
then
i
knocked
and
she
took
an
awfully
long
time
simply
to
open
that
door
and
when
she
did
her
eyes
were
red
and
she
was
shivering
as
if
she
was
cold
oh
billy
billy
she
said
and
then
of
all
things
she
grabbed
me
and
kissed
me
i
wriggled
loose
and
i
said
sew
up
this
sail
for
me
will
you
hustle
but
she
did
pay
attention
oh
billy
be
a
little
good
to
me
she
said
i
so
wretched
and
nobody
knows
but
you
oh
billy
he
likes
somebody
better
than
me
who
does
i
asked
father
she
half
laughed
a
sort
of
sickly
laugh
no
billy
not
father
he
jack
denbigh
oh
you
know
billy
you
heard
what
mother
o
o
oh
i
answered
her
in
a
contemplating
slowness
oh
that
so
do
you
mind
if
he
gets
engaged
to
aunt
elizabeth
do
i
mind
said
peggy
as
if
she
was
astonished
mind
billy
love
him
till
i
die
it
would
break
my
oh
no
it
would
i
told
her
because
i
thought
i
sort
of
comfort
her
that
truck
you
ca
break
muscles
just
by
loving
but
i
know
how
you
feel
because
that
the
way
i
felt
when
father
gave
that
irish
setter
to
the
she
went
on
chattering
her
teeth
as
if
she
was
cold
so
i
put
the
around
her
you
dear
billy
she
said
but
that
was
stuff
i
would
bother
i
said
likely
he
forgotten
about
you
i
often
forget
things
that
did
seem
to
comfort
her
for
she
began
to
sob
out
loud
oh
now
peg
do
cry
i
observed
to
her
he
probably
likes
aunt
elizabeth
better
than
you
do
you
see
i
think
prettier
myself
and
of
course
she
a
lot
cleverer
she
tells
funny
stories
and
makes
people
laugh
you
never
do
that
you
a
good
sort
but
quiet
and
not
much
fun
do
you
see
maybe
he
got
plain
tired
of
but
instead
of
being
cheered
up
by
my
explaining
things
she
put
her
head
on
the
table
and
just
yowled
girls
are
a
queer
species
you
cruel
cruel
she
sobbed
out
and
you
bet
that
surprised
me
me
that
was
comforting
her
for
all
i
was
worth
i
patted
her
on
the
back
of
the
neck
and
thought
hard
what
other
soothings
i
could
squeeze
out
then
i
had
an
idea
tell
you
what
peg
i
said
it
too
darned
bad
of
denbigh
if
he
just
did
it
for
meanness
when
you
have
done
anything
to
him
but
maybe
he
got
riled
because
you
begged
him
so
to
let
you
be
engaged
to
him
of
course
a
man
does
want
to
be
bothered
if
he
wants
to
get
engaged
he
wants
to
and
if
he
does
want
to
he
does
and
that
all
i
think
probably
denbigh
was
afraid
be
at
him
again
when
you
came
home
so
he
hurried
up
and
snatched
aunt
peggy
lifted
her
face
and
stared
at
me
she
was
a
sight
with
her
eyes
all
bunged
up
and
her
cheeks
sloppy
you
think
he
is
engaged
to
her
do
you
billy
she
asked
me
her
voice
sort
of
shook
and
i
thought
i
better
settle
it
for
her
one
way
or
the
other
so
i
nodded
and
said
would
be
surprised
and
then
if
you
believe
it
that
girl
got
angry
at
me
billy
you
brutal
you
like
any
other
and
faithless
and
and
she
began
choking
choking
again
and
i
was
disgusted
and
cleared
out
i
was
glad
when
she
went
off
to
college
because
though
she
a
girl
she
was
so
peevish
and
untalkative
it
made
me
tired
i
think
people
ought
to
be
cheerful
around
their
own
homes
but
the
family
did
seem
to
see
it
there
are
such
a
lot
of
us
that
you
have
to
blow
a
trumpet
before
you
get
any
special
notice
except
me
when
i
do
wash
my
hands
yet
what
the
use
of
washing
your
hands
when
you
certain
to
get
them
dirty
again
in
five
minutes
well
then
awhile
ago
peggy
wrote
she
was
engaged
to
harry
goward
and
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
happy
home
my
people
are
mobile
in
their
temperatures
anyway
a
little
thing
stirs
them
up
i
thought
it
was
queerish
but
i
did
know
but
peggy
had
changed
her
mind
about
loving
denbigh
till
she
died
i
should
think
that
was
too
long
myself
i
was
busy
getting
my
saddle
mended
and
a
new
bridle
so
i
did
have
time
for
gossip
harry
came
to
visit
the
family
and
the
minute
i
inspected
him
over
i
knew
he
was
a
sissy
if
you
believe
me
that
man
ca
chin
himself
he
sings
and
paints
apple
blossoms
but
he
fell
over
a
fence
that
i
vaulted
he
may
be
fascinating
as
lorraine
says
but
he
is
worth
saving
in
my
judgments
i
said
so
to
denbigh
one
day
when
he
picked
me
up
in
his
machine
and
brought
me
home
from
school
and
he
was
sympathetic
and
asked
intelligent
questions
at
least
some
of
them
were
some
of
them
were
just
slow
remarks
about
if
peggy
seemed
to
be
very
happy
and
that
sort
of
stuff
that
does
have
any
foundations
i
told
him
particularly
that
i
like
automobiles
and
he
thought
a
minute
and
then
said
if
you
were
going
to
be
playing
near
the
whitman
station
pick
you
up
and
take
you
on
a
spin
i
lunching
with
some
people
near
whitman
and
going
on
to
oh
pickles
said
i
will
you
really
of
course
i
be
there
i
drive
over
with
the
expressman
he
a
friend
of
mine
right
after
lunch
i
said
and
i
wait
around
the
station
for
so
i
did
that
and
while
i
was
waiting
i
saw
aunt
elizabeth
coming
i
saw
her
first
so
i
hid
i
was
afraid
if
she
saw
me
she
find
out
i
was
going
with
denbigh
and
snatch
him
herself
i
heard
her
sending
a
crazy
telegram
to
harry
goward
and
then
i
forgot
all
about
it
until
i
wanted
to
distract
alice
mind
off
some
cookies
that
i
accumulated
at
lorraine
house
alice
is
a
pig
she
never
lets
me
stuff
in
peace
so
i
told
her
about
the
telegram
i
knew
alice
would
be
perturbed
with
that
she
just
loves
to
tell
things
but
she
made
me
tell
peggy
and
there
was
a
hullabaloo
promptly
nobody
confided
a
word
to
me
and
i
did
care
much
but
i
saw
them
all
whispering
in
low
tones
and
being
very
busy
about
it
and
peg
looking
madder
than
a
goat
and
i
guessed
that
alice
had
made
me
raise
cain
now
i
got
to
back
up
and
start
over
golly
it
harder
than
think
just
to
write
down
things
the
way
they
happened
like
i
promised
lorraine
let
see
oh
yes
of
course
about
denbigh
and
the
bubble
i
was
in
a
fit
for
fear
dear
aunt
elizabeth
would
linger
around
till
the
doctor
came
and
then
somehow
i
be
minus
one
drive
in
a
machine
she
did
she
cleared
out
with
solidity
and
despatch
and
my
aurora
as
the
would
say
came
in
his
whirling
car
and
in
i
popped
and
we
had
a
corking
time
he
let
me
drive
a
little
you
see
the
machine
is
a
oh
well
lorraine
said
specially
i
was
not
to
describe
automobiles
that
seems
such
a
stupid
restrictiveness
but
a
case
of
cookies
so
i
cut
that
out
there
really
was
much
else
to
tell
only
that
denbigh
started
right
in
and
raked
out
the
inmost
linings
of
my
soul
about
peggy
and
harry
goward
it
was
exactly
because
he
cross
yet
he
fired
the
questions
at
me
like
a
cannon
and
i
answered
quick
you
bet
denbigh
knows
what
he
wants
and
he
means
to
get
it
just
by
accident
toward
the
last
i
let
out
about
that
day
in
the
winter
when
they
were
chaffing
aunt
elizabeth
at
the
table
about
him
and
how
he
taken
her
out
in
the
machine
and
how
mother
had
said
there
might
be
an
engagement
to
write
peggy
about
oh
said
denbigh
oh
oh
funny
the
way
he
went
on
saying
oh
oh
i
thought
if
that
interested
him
he
might
like
to
hear
about
peg
throwing
a
fit
in
her
room
after
so
i
told
him
that
and
how
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
how
unreasonable
she
was
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
said
he
looked
at
me
a
minute
with
his
eyebrows
away
down
and
his
mouth
jammed
together
and
then
he
brought
out
you
little
devil
that
not
the
worst
he
said
either
i
guess
mother
would
let
me
go
out
with
him
if
she
knew
he
used
profanity
maria
would
anyway
i
have
decided
i
wo
tell
them
it
the
only
time
i
ever
caught
him
the
other
thing
is
this
he
said
to
himself
but
out
loud
i
think
he
had
forgotten
me
so
they
made
her
believe
i
liked
her
aunt
and
then
in
a
minute
she
said
it
would
break
her
heart
bless
her
and
two
or
three
other
interlocutory
remarks
like
that
meaning
nothing
in
particular
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
his
knee
with
a
bang
and
said
damn
aunt
elizabeth
not
loud
but
compressed
and
explodingly
you
know
i
looked
at
him
and
he
said
beg
pardon
billy
your
aunt
a
very
charming
woman
but
i
mean
it
i
only
asked
her
to
go
out
with
me
because
she
talked
more
about
peggy
than
anybody
else
would
he
went
on
i
thought
a
minute
and
put
two
and
two
together
pretty
quick
you
mind
about
peggy
being
engaged
to
harry
goward
do
you
i
asked
him
for
i
saw
right
through
him
then
he
looked
queer
yes
i
mind
he
said
but
you
would
be
engaged
to
her
yourself
i
propounded
to
him
and
he
grinned
and
said
something
about
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
and
called
me
horatio
i
reckon
he
got
struck
crazy
a
minute
and
then
he
made
me
tell
him
further
what
peggy
said
and
what
i
said
and
he
laughed
that
time
about
my
comforting
her
though
i
do
see
why
it
does
pay
to
give
up
important
things
to
be
kind
and
thoughtful
in
this
world
nobody
appreciates
it
and
you
are
sure
to
be
sorry
you
took
the
time
when
i
got
after
comforting
peggy
my
toad
had
jumped
in
the
and
got
about
drowned
he
never
was
the
same
toad
after
and
if
i
had
stopped
in
peg
room
to
do
good
it
have
happened
and
denbigh
laughed
at
me
besides
however
for
an
old
chap
of
forty
he
a
peach
i
not
kicking
at
denbigh
then
let
see
it
makes
me
tired
to
go
on
writing
this
stuff
i
wish
i
was
through
but
the
cookies
i
see
a
vision
of
a
mountain
range
of
cookies
with
currants
on
them
crumbly
cookies
up
and
at
it
again
for
me
the
next
stunt
i
had
a
shy
at
was
a
letter
that
harry
goward
asked
alice
to
give
peggy
and
alice
gave
it
to
me
because
she
was
up
to
something
else
just
that
minute
she
did
look
at
the
address
but
you
bet
your
sweet
life
i
did
when
i
heard
it
was
from
harry
goward
i
saw
it
was
addressed
to
peg
then
i
stuffed
it
in
my
pocket
and
plain
forgot
because
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
fishing
with
sid
tracy
i
put
a
chub
on
top
of
it
that
i
wanted
to
keep
for
bait
and
when
i
pulled
it
out
the
letter
the
chub
had
helped
much
the
envelope
was
a
little
slimy
i
said
gee
sid
said
what
that
a
letter
to
my
sister
from
that
chump
harry
goward
said
i
i
got
to
take
it
to
her
looks
pretty
sad
sid
did
like
harry
goward
any
more
than
i
did
because
he
borrowed
sid
best
racket
and
left
it
out
in
the
rain
and
then
just
laughed
so
he
said
not
sad
enough
give
it
to
me
i
fix
he
had
some
molasses
candy
that
he
bit
and
he
rubbed
that
over
it
a
little
and
then
suddenly
we
heard
alice
calling
and
he
crammed
the
letter
in
his
pocket
candy
and
all
and
there
were
some
other
things
in
there
that
stuck
to
it
we
were
so
rattled
when
alice
appeared
and
demanded
that
very
letter
in
her
lordly
way
that
i
forgot
if
i
had
it
or
sid
and
i
went
all
through
my
clothes
looking
for
it
and
then
sid
found
it
in
his
and
oh
my
miss
alice
turned
up
her
nose
when
she
saw
it
it
did
look
smudgy
sid
hurriedly
scrubbed
it
with
his
handkerchief
but
even
that
really
make
it
clean
and
by
that
time
you
could
read
the
address
alice
did
ask
me
if
i
read
it
or
i
have
told
her
there
was
a
fuss
afterward
in
the
family
but
i
kept
clear
of
it
i
would
have
time
to
get
through
what
i
have
to
do
if
i
attended
to
their
fusses
so
all
i
knew
was
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
that
letter
all
the
family
were
taking
trains
like
a
procession
for
two
or
three
days
i
do
know
why
so
lorraine
ca
expect
me
to
write
that
down
there
only
one
other
event
of
great
signification
that
i
know
about
and
nobody
knows
that
except
me
and
denbigh
and
peggy
it
was
this
way
the
doctor
saw
me
on
the
street
one
afternoon
i
ca
remember
what
day
it
was
and
stopped
his
machine
and
motioned
to
me
to
get
in
you
bet
i
got
he
shook
hands
with
me
just
the
way
he
would
with
father
and
not
as
if
i
were
a
contemptible
puppy
billy
my
son
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
he
said
all
right
said
i
i
got
to
see
peggy
he
went
on
i
got
to
and
he
looked
as
fierce
as
a
circus
tiger
i
ca
sit
still
and
not
lift
a
finger
and
let
this
wretched
business
go
on
i
wo
lose
her
for
any
silly
i
did
know
what
he
was
driving
at
but
i
said
i
would
either
in
a
sympathetic
manner
i
got
to
see
her
he
fired
at
me
again
yep
i
said
she
up
at
the
house
now
come
but
that
suit
him
he
explained
that
she
would
look
at
him
when
the
others
were
around
and
that
she
slid
off
and
wormed
out
of
his
way
so
he
could
get
at
her
anyhow
just
like
a
girl
was
it
not
to
face
the
music
well
anyway
he
cooked
up
a
plan
that
he
wanted
me
to
do
and
i
promised
i
would
he
wanted
me
to
get
peggy
to
go
up
the
river
to
their
former
only
he
put
it
differently
and
he
would
be
there
waiting
and
make
peggy
talk
to
him
which
he
seemed
to
desire
more
than
honey
in
the
honeycomb
lovers
are
a
strange
animal
i
may
be
foolish
but
i
prefer
toads
with
them
you
can
tie
a
string
around
the
hind
leg
and
you
have
got
them
but
with
lovers
it
all
this
way
one
day
and
upside
down
the
next
and
wondering
what
hurt
the
feelings
of
her
and
if
he
got
tired
of
you
and
polyandering
around
to
get
interviews
up
rivers
when
you
could
easier
sit
on
the
piazza
and
talk
and
all
such
it
seems
to
me
that
things
would
go
a
lot
simpler
if
everybody
would
cut
out
most
of
the
feelings
department
and
just
eat
their
meals
and
look
after
their
animals
and
play
all
they
get
time
for
and
then
go
to
sleep
quietly
fussing
is
such
a
depravity
but
they
would
do
what
i
said
not
if
i
told
them
so
i
lie
low
and
think
next
morning
i
harnessed
the
pony
in
the
cart
and
said
peg
take
a
drive
with
me
come
on
and
peg
looked
grattyfied
and
mother
said
i
was
a
dear
thoughtful
child
and
grandma
said
it
would
do
the
girl
good
and
i
was
a
noble
lad
so
i
got
encombiums
all
round
for
once
only
aunt
elizabeth
she
looked
thoughtful
i
rattled
hotspur
that
the
pony
out
to
the
happy
by
the
river
till
i
saw
denbigh
gray
cap
behind
a
bush
and
i
rightly
argued
that
his
manly
form
was
hitched
onto
it
for
he
arose
up
in
his
might
as
i
stopped
the
cart
peggy
gasped
and
said
oh
oh
we
must
go
home
oh
billy
drive
on
which
billy
did
do
not
so
you
notice
it
then
the
doctor
said
in
his
manner
get
out
peggy
and
held
his
hand
and
peggy
said
i
wo
i
ca
and
immediately
did
the
goose
then
he
looked
at
me
in
a
funny
fierce
way
he
has
with
his
eyebrows
away
down
only
you
know
he
pleasant
because
his
eyes
jiggle
billy
my
son
he
said
will
you
kindly
deprive
us
of
the
light
of
your
presence
for
one
hour
by
the
clock
here
my
timepiece
one
hour
go
and
he
gave
hotspur
a
slap
so
he
leaped
denbigh
is
the
most
different
person
from
harry
goward
i
know
well
i
drove
round
by
the
red
bridge
and
was
gone
an
hour
and
twelve
minutes
and
i
thought
they
be
missing
me
and
in
a
fit
to
get
home
so
i
just
raced
hotspur
the
last
mile
i
awfully
sorry
i
so
late
said
i
i
got
looking
at
some
pigs
so
i
forgot
i
sorry
said
peg
looked
up
at
me
as
if
she
could
remember
who
i
was
and
inquired
wonderingly
is
it
an
hour
yet
and
denbigh
said
great
scott
boy
you
need
have
hurried
that
lovers
all
over
and
they
had
finished
yet
if
you
believe
me
denbigh
went
on
talking
as
they
stood
up
just
as
if
i
was
living
you
wo
promise
me
he
asked
her
and
she
said
oh
jack
how
can
i
i
do
know
what
to
do
but
engaged
to
him
that
a
solemn
solemn
nonsense
said
the
doctor
you
do
love
him
you
never
did
you
never
could
be
a
woman
dearest
and
end
this
wretched
i
never
would
have
thought
i
loved
him
if
i
had
believed
i
lost
you
peggy
ruminated
to
herself
but
i
must
think
as
if
she
thunk
for
an
hour
how
long
must
you
think
the
doctor
fired
at
her
do
be
cross
at
me
said
she
like
a
baby
and
that
big
capable
man
picked
up
her
hand
and
kissed
it
shame
on
him
no
no
dear
he
said
as
meek
as
pie
i
wait
only
you
must
decide
the
right
way
and
remember
that
i
waiting
and
that
then
he
put
her
into
the
cart
clingingly
i
have
chucked
her
and
i
leaned
over
toward
him
the
last
thing
and
threw
my
head
lovingly
on
one
side
and
rolled
my
eyes
up
and
murmured
at
him
jack
and
started
hotspur
before
he
could
hit
me
now
thank
the
stars
there
just
one
or
two
little
items
more
that
i
got
to
write
one
is
what
i
heard
mother
tell
father
when
they
were
on
the
front
piazza
alone
and
i
was
teaching
the
puppy
to
beg
right
in
sight
of
them
on
the
grass
they
think
i
an
earless
freak
maybe
she
told
him
that
dear
peggy
was
growing
into
such
a
strong
splendid
woman
that
she
been
talking
to
her
and
she
thought
the
child
would
be
able
to
give
up
her
weak
vacillating
lover
with
hardly
a
pang
because
she
realized
that
he
was
unworthy
of
her
that
peg
had
said
she
marry
a
man
she
did
admire
and
was
that
noble
of
her
noble
your
grandmother
to
give
up
a
perfect
lady
like
harry
goward
when
she
got
a
real
man
up
her
sleeve
i
have
made
them
sit
up
and
take
notice
if
i
had
promised
not
to
tell
which
reminds
me
that
i
ought
to
explain
how
i
got
denbigh
to
let
me
write
this
for
lorraine
i
put
it
to
him
strongly
you
see
about
the
cookies
and
at
first
he
said
not
on
your
life
not
in
a
thousand
years
and
then
but
what
the
use
of
writing
that
lorraine
is
on
to
all
that
but
my
pickles
wo
there
be
a
circus
when
alice
finds
out
that
i
known
things

hopping
gee

for
a
minute
on
his
way

from
the
office
where
he
has
been
clearing
out
his
desk
for

home
of
the

her
all

the
making
of

her

a
but
i
do
want
to
talk
said
i
i
do
want
to
talk
to
good
for
you
said
charles
edward
now
i
run
i
sat
there
on
the
piazza
watching
him
thinking
he
been
awfully
good
to
me
and
feeling
less
bruised
somehow
than
i
do
when
the
rest
of
the
family
advise
me
except
mother
and
i
saw
him
stop
turn
round
as
if
he
were
coming
back
and
then
settle
himself
and
plant
his
feet
wide
apart
as
he
does
when
the
family
question
him
about
business
then
i
saw
somebody
in
light
blue
through
the
trees
and
i
knew
it
was
aunt
elizabeth
alice
was
down
in
the
hammock
reading
and
eating
cookies
and
she
saw
her
too
alice
threw
the
book
away
and
got
her
long
legs
out
of
the
hammock
and
ran
i
thought
she
was
coming
into
the
house
to
hide
from
aunt
elizabeth
that
what
we
all
do
the
first
minute
and
then
we
recover
ourselves
and
go
down
and
meet
her
but
alice
dropped
on
her
knees
by
my
chair
and
threw
her
arms
round
me
forgive
peggy
she
moaned
oh
forgive
i
saw
she
had
on
my
fraternity
pin
and
i
thought
she
meant
that
so
i
said
you
can
wear
it
today
but
she
only
hugged
me
the
tighter
and
ran
on
in
a
rigmarole
i
did
understand
she
coming
and
she
get
it
out
of
lorraine
and
they
all
be
down
on
charles
edward
and
aunt
elizabeth
stood
talking
together
and
just
then
i
saw
her
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
she
trying
to
come
round
him
said
alice
i
began
to
see
she
was
really
in
earnest
now
he
squirming
oh
peggy
maybe
she
found
it
out
some
way
and
she
telling
him
and
they
tell
you
and
you
think
i
am
false
as
hell
i
knew
she
did
mean
anything
by
that
word
because
whenever
she
says
such
things
they
always
quotations
she
began
to
cry
real
tears
it
was
billy
put
it
into
my
head
said
she
and
lorraine
put
it
into
his
lorraine
wanted
him
to
write
out
exactly
what
he
knew
and
he
did
know
anything
except
about
the
telegram
and
how
the
letter
got
wuzzled
and
i
told
him
i
help
him
write
it
as
it
ought
to
be
life
were
a
banquet
and
beauty
were
wine
but
i
told
him
we
must
make
him
say
in
it
how
he
got
to
conceal
it
from
me
or
they
think
we
got
it
up
together
so
i
wrote
it
said
alice
and
billy
copied
perhaps
i
was
nice
to
the
child
for
i
could
listen
to
her
i
was
watching
charles
edward
and
aunt
elizabeth
and
saying
to
myself
that
mother
want
me
to
sit
still
and
meet
aunt
elizabeth
when
she
came
like
a
good
girl
as
she
used
to
say
to
me
when
i
was
little
and
begged
to
get
out
of
hard
things
alice
went
on
talking
and
gasping
peg
she
said
he
perfectly
splendid
denbigh
yes
dear
said
i
he
very
i
adored
him
for
years
said
alice
i
could
trust
him
with
my
whole
future
i
could
trust
him
with
then
i
laughed
i
could
help
it
and
alice
was
hurt
for
some
reason
and
got
up
and
held
her
head
high
and
went
into
the
house
and
aunt
elizabeth
came
up
the
drive
and
that
is
how
she
found
me
laughing
she
had
on
a
lovely
linen
nobody
wears
such
delicate
shades
as
aunt
elizabeth
i
remember
one
day
when
she
came
in
an
embroidered
pongee
over
father
groaned
and
grandmother
said
what
is
it
cyrus
have
you
got
a
pain
yes
said
father
the
pain
i
always
have
when
i
see
sheep
dressed
lamb
grandmother
laughed
but
mother
said
sh
mother
dear
this
time
aunt
elizabeth
had
on
a
great
with
ostrich
plumes
it
was
almost
the
shape
of
her
lavender
one
that
charles
edward
said
made
her
look
like
a
coster
bride
when
she
bent
over
me
and
put
both
arms
around
me
the
plumes
tickled
my
ear
i
think
that
was
why
i
was
so
cross
i
wriggled
away
from
her
and
said
do
aunt
elizabeth
spoke
quite
solemnly
dear
child
she
said
you
are
broken
and
i
began
to
feel
again
just
as
i
had
been
feeling
as
if
i
were
in
a
show
for
everybody
to
look
at
and
i
found
i
was
shaking
all
over
and
was
angry
with
myself
because
of
it
she
had
drawn
up
a
chair
and
she
held
both
my
hands
peggy
said
she
have
you
been
to
the
hospital
to
see
that
poor
dear
boy
i
did
have
to
answer
for
there
was
a
whirl
on
the
gravel
and
billy
on
his
bicycle
came
riding
up
with
the
mail
he
threw
himself
off
his
wheel
and
plunged
up
the
steps
as
he
always
does
pretended
to
tickle
his
nose
with
aunt
elizabeth
feathers
as
he
passed
behind
her
and
whispered
to
me
shoot
the
hat
but
he
had
heard
aunt
elizabeth
asking
if
i
were
not
going
to
see
that
poor
dear
boy
and
he
said
as
if
he
could
help
it
huh
i
guess
if
she
did
she
would
get
in
his
mother
walking
up
and
down
front
of
the
hospital
when
she
ai
with
him
and
she
got
a
hook
nose
and
white
hair
done
up
over
a
roll
and
an
on
a
stick
and
i
guess
there
wo
be
no
nimps
and
shepherdesses
get
by
aunt
elizabeth
stood
and
thought
for
a
minute
and
her
eyes
looked
as
they
do
when
she
stares
through
you
and
does
see
you
at
all
alice
asked
charles
edward
once
if
he
thought
she
was
sorrowing
the
past
when
she
had
that
look
and
he
said
bless
you
chile
no
more
than
a
gentle
industrious
spider
she
spinning
a
but
in
a
minute
mother
had
stepped
out
on
the
piazza
and
i
felt
as
if
she
had
come
to
my
rescue
it
was
the
way
she
used
to
come
when
i
broke
my
doll
or
tore
my
skirt
but
we
did
look
at
each
other
mother
and
i
we
did
mean
aunt
elizabeth
should
see
there
was
anything
to
rescue
me
from
aunt
elizabeth
turned
to
mother
and
seemed
to
pounce
upon
her
ada
said
she
has
my
engagement
been
announced
not
to
my
knowledge
said
mother
she
spoke
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
i
understood
that
the
name
of
the
gentleman
had
been
withheld
repeated
aunt
elizabeth
what
do
you
mean
by
billy
whom
are
those
letters
for
in
spite
of
ourselves
mother
and
i
started
letters
have
begun
to
seem
rather
tragic
to
us
one
the
said
billy
and
one
for
aunt
elizabeth
took
the
large
square
envelope
and
tore
it
open
then
she
looked
at
mother
and
smiled
a
little
and
tossed
her
head
this
is
from
lyman
wilde
said
she
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
aunt
elizabeth
look
so
young
it
must
have
meant
something
more
to
mother
than
it
did
to
me
for
she
stared
at
her
a
minute
very
seriously
i
am
truly
glad
for
you
elizabeth
she
said
then
she
turned
to
me
daughter
said
she
i
shall
need
you
about
the
she
smiled
at
me
and
went
in
i
knew
what
that
meant
she
was
giving
me
a
chance
to
follow
her
if
i
needed
to
escape
but
there
was
hardly
time
i
was
at
the
door
when
aunt
elizabeth
rustled
after
so
quickly
that
it
sounded
like
a
flight
there
on
the
piazza
she
put
her
arms
about
me
child
she
whispered
child
verlassen
verlassen
i
drew
away
a
little
and
looked
at
her
then
i
thought
why
she
is
old
but
i
had
understood
i
knew
the
word
was
german
and
i
taken
that
in
the
elective
course
what
is
it
aunt
elizabeth
i
asked
i
had
a
feeling
i
must
leave
her
she
smiled
a
little
a
queer
sad
smile
peggy
said
she
i
want
you
to
read
this
she
gave
it
to
me
it
was
written
on
very
thick
gray
paper
with
rough
edges
and
there
was
a
margin
of
two
inches
at
the
left
the
handwriting
was
beautiful
only
not
very
clear
and
when
i
had
puzzled
over
it
for
a
minute
she
snatched
it
back
again
i
read
it
to
you
said
she
well
i
thought
it
was
a
most
beautiful
letter
the
gentleman
said
she
had
always
been
the
ideal
of
his
life
he
owed
everything
and
by
everything
he
meant
chiefly
his
worship
of
beauty
to
her
he
asked
her
to
accept
his
undying
devotion
and
to
believe
that
however
far
distance
and
time
should
part
them
he
was
hers
and
hers
only
he
said
he
looked
back
with
ineffable
contempt
upon
the
days
when
he
had
hoped
to
build
a
nest
and
see
her
beside
him
there
now
he
had
reached
the
true
empyrean
and
he
could
only
ask
to
know
that
she
too
was
winging
her
bright
way
into
regions
where
he
in
another
life
might
follow
and
sing
beside
her
in
liquid
throbbing
notes
to
pierce
the
stars
he
ended
by
saying
that
he
was
not
very
fit
the
opera
season
had
been
a
monumental
experience
this
year
and
he
was
taking
refuge
with
an
english
brotherhood
to
lead
for
a
time
a
cloistered
life
instinct
with
beauty
and
its
worship
but
that
there
as
everywhere
he
was
hers
eternally
how
glad
i
was
of
the
verbal
memory
i
have
been
so
often
praised
for
i
knew
almost
every
word
of
that
lovely
letter
by
heart
after
the
one
reading
i
shall
never
forget
it
well
said
aunt
elizabeth
she
was
looking
at
me
and
again
i
saw
how
long
it
must
have
been
since
she
was
young
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
told
the
truth
oh
said
i
i
think
it
a
beautiful
letter
you
do
said
aunt
elizabeth
does
it
strike
you
as
being
a
i
could
answer
fast
enough
why
aunt
elizabeth
i
said
he
tells
you
so
he
says
he
loves
you
eternally
it
beautiful
you
fool
said
aunt
elizabeth
you
little
fool
you
have
opened
the
door
yet
not
any
door
not
one
of
them
oh
you
happy
happy
fool
she
called
through
the
window
mother
was
arranging
flowers
there
for
tea
ada
you
must
telephone
the
banner
my
engagement
is
not
to
be
then
she
turned
to
me
peggy
said
she
in
a
low
voice
as
if
mother
was
not
to
hear
you
must
drive
with
me
to
something
choked
me
in
my
throat
either
fear
of
her
or
dread
of
what
she
meant
to
make
me
do
but
i
looked
into
her
face
and
answered
with
all
the
strength
i
had
aunt
elizabeth
i
go
near
the
do
you
think
it
decent
for
you
to
call
on
goward
she
asked
she
gave
me
a
little
shake
it
made
me
angry
it
may
be
decent
i
said
but
i
do
very
well
said
aunt
elizabeth
her
voice
was
sweet
again
then
i
must
do
it
for
you
nobody
asks
you
to
see
harry
himself
i
run
in
and
have
a
word
with
him
but
peggy
you
simply
must
pay
your
respects
to
no
no
no
i
heard
myself
answering
as
if
i
were
in
some
strange
dream
then
i
said
why
it
would
be
dreadful
mother
would
let
me
aunt
elizabeth
came
closer
and
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
she
has
a
little
fragrance
about
her
not
like
flowers
but
old
laces
perhaps
that
have
been
a
long
time
in
a
drawer
with
orris
and
and
things
peggy
said
she
never
tell
your
mother
i
asked
i
felt
myself
stiffen
she
was
whispering
and
i
saw
she
meant
it
oh
peggy
do
tell
your
mother
she
is
not
not
simpatica
i
might
lose
my
home
here
my
only
home
peggy
promise
daughter
mother
was
calling
from
the
i
slipped
away
from
aunt
elizabeth
hands
i
promise
said
i
you
lose
your
daughter
mother
called
again
and
i
went
in
that
night
at
supper
nobody
talked
except
father
and
mother
and
they
did
every
minute
as
if
they
wanted
to
keep
the
rest
of
us
from
speaking
a
word
it
was
all
about
the
works
father
was
describing
some
new
designs
he
had
accepted
and
telling
how
charles
edward
said
they
would
do
very
well
for
the
trimmings
of
a
hearse
and
mother
coughed
and
said
charles
edward
ideas
were
always
good
and
father
said
not
where
the
market
was
concerned
aunt
elizabeth
had
put
on
a
white
dress
and
i
thought
she
looked
sweet
because
she
was
sad
and
had
made
her
face
quite
pale
but
i
was
chiefly
busy
in
thinking
how
to
escape
before
anybody
could
talk
to
me
it
does
seem
safe
nowadays
to
speak
a
word
because
we
do
know
where
it
will
lead
us
alice
too
looked
pale
poor
child
and
kept
glancing
at
me
in
a
way
that
made
me
so
sorry
i
wanted
to
tell
her
i
did
care
about
her
pranks
and
billy
whatever
they
were
and
whatever
she
had
written
it
was
sure
to
be
clever
the
teacher
says
alice
has
a
positive
genius
for
writing
and
before
many
years
she
be
in
all
the
magazines
when
supper
was
over
i
ran
to
my
room
i
sat
down
by
the
window
in
the
dark
and
wondered
when
the
moon
would
rise
i
felt
excited
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
and
in
spite
of
all
the
dreadful
things
that
had
happened
to
us
and
might
keep
on
happening
i
felt
as
if
i
could
die
with
joy
there
were
steps
on
the
porch
below
my
window
i
heard
father
voice
that
ridiculous
elizabeth
he
said
ridiculous
if
it
a
good
thing
for
other
girls
to
go
to
college
it
been
a
good
thing
for
ah
said
aunt
elizabeth
but
is
it
a
good
thing
then
i
knew
they
were
talking
about
me
and
i
put
my
fingers
in
my
ears
and
said
the
latin
prepositions
i
have
been
talked
about
enough
they
may
talk
but
i
wo
hear
i
took
my
fingers
out
and
listened
they
had
gone
in
and
everything
was
still
then
i
began
to
think
it
over
was
it
a
bad
thing
for
me
to
go
to
college
i
different
from
what
i
was
three
years
ago
but
i
should
have
been
different
if
stayed
at
home
for
one
thing
i
not
so
shy
i
remember
the
first
day
i
came
out
of
a
and
stillman
dane
walked
up
to
me
and
said
so
you
charlie
ned
sister
i
could
look
at
him
i
stood
staring
down
at
my
and
now
i
should
say
quite
calmly
oh
you
must
be
dane
i
believe
you
teach
but
i
stood
and
stared
i
believe
i
looked
at
my
hands
for
a
while
and
wished
i
got
ink
on
my
forefinger
and
he
had
to
say
i
the
psychology
man
charlie
ned
and
i
were
college
friends
he
wrote
me
about
but
though
i
did
look
at
him
that
first
time
i
thought
he
had
the
kindest
voice
that
ever
was
except
mother
and
perhaps
that
was
why
i
selected
psychology
for
my
specialty
i
was
afraid
i
might
be
stupid
and
i
knew
he
was
kind
and
then
came
that
happy
time
when
i
was
getting
acquainted
with
everybody
and
dane
was
always
doing
things
for
me
i
awfully
fond
of
charlie
ned
you
know
he
told
me
you
must
let
me
take
his
then
goward
told
me
all
those
things
at
the
dance
how
he
had
found
life
a
bitter
waste
how
he
had
been
betrayed
over
and
over
by
the
vain
and
worldly
and
how
his
heart
was
dead
and
nobody
could
bring
it
to
life
but
me
he
said
i
was
his
fate
and
his
and
since
love
was
a
mutual
flame
that
meant
he
was
my
fate
too
but
it
seemed
as
if
that
were
the
beginning
of
all
my
bad
luck
for
about
that
time
stillman
dane
was
different
and
one
day
he
stopped
me
in
the
yard
when
i
was
going
to
chapel
miss
peggy
said
he
do
let
he
held
out
his
hand
and
i
gave
him
mine
quickly
no
said
i
i
not
i
want
to
ask
you
something
said
he
you
must
answer
truly
if
i
have
a
friend
and
she
doing
something
foolish
should
i
tell
her
should
i
write
to
her
brother
and
tell
him
why
said
i
do
you
mean
me
then
i
understood
you
think
i
not
doing
very
well
in
my
psychology
i
said
you
think
i
made
a
wrong
i
looked
at
him
then
i
never
saw
him
look
just
so
he
had
my
hand
and
now
i
took
it
away
but
he
would
talk
about
the
psychology
peggy
said
he
do
your
people
know
goward
they
will
in
vacation
i
said
he
going
home
with
me
engaged
you
oh
said
he
oh
then
it
is
true
let
him
meet
charles
edward
at
once
will
you
tell
charles
edward
i
particularly
want
him
to
know
his
voice
sounded
sharp
and
quick
and
he
turned
away
and
left
me
but
i
did
give
his
message
to
charles
edward
and
somehow
i
do
know
why
i
did
talk
about
him
after
i
came
home
dane
never
wrote
me
whether
he
looked
you
up
said
charles
edward
one
day
not
very
civil
of
but
even
then
i
could
tell
him
dane
is
one
of
the
people
i
never
can
talk
about
as
if
they
were
like
everybody
else
perhaps
that
is
because
he
is
so
kind
in
a
sort
of
intimate
beautiful
way
and
when
i
went
back
after
vacation
he
had
resigned
and
they
said
he
had
inherited
some
money
and
gone
away
and
after
he
went
i
never
understood
the
psychology
at
all
goward
used
to
laugh
at
me
for
taking
it
only
he
said
i
could
get
honors
in
anything
my
verbal
memory
is
so
good
but
i
told
him
and
it
is
true
that
the
last
part
of
the
book
is
very
dull
while
i
was
going
over
all
this
still
with
that
strange
excited
feeling
of
happiness
i
heard
aunt
elizabeth
voice
from
below
she
was
calling
softly
peggy
peggy
are
you
up
there
i
got
on
my
feet
just
as
quietly
as
i
could
and
slipped
through
mother
room
and
down
the
back
stairs
mother
was
in
the
vegetable
garden
watering
the
transplanted
lettuce
i
ran
out
to
her
mother
i
said
may
i
go
over
to
lorraine
and
spend
the
night
yes
lamb
said
mother
that
a
good
deal
for
mother
to
say
i
run
over
now
i
told
her
i
wo
stop
to
take
anything
lorraine
will
give
me
a
i
went
through
the
vegetable
garden
to
the
back
gate
and
out
into
the
street
there
i
drew
a
long
breath
i
do
know
what
i
thought
aunt
elizabeth
could
do
to
me
but
i
felt
safe
then
i
could
laugh
at
it
all
because
it
seems
as
if
i
must
have
been
sort
of
crazy
that
night
i
began
to
run
as
if
i
could
get
there
fast
enough
but
when
i
got
to
the
steps
i
heard
lorraine
laughing
and
i
stopped
to
listen
to
see
whether
any
one
was
there
i
tell
peter
said
she
that
it
his
opportunity
do
you
remember
the
great
magician
story
of
the
man
who
was
always
afraid
he
should
miss
his
opportunity
and
the
opportunity
came
and
sure
enough
the
man
did
know
it
and
it
slipped
by
well
that
must
be
it
mus
be
any
of
us
said
a
voice
things
are
mighty
critical
though
it
as
if
everybody
the
world
and
the
flesh
and
the
whole
family
had
been
blundering
round
and
setting
their
feet
down
as
near
as
they
could
to
a
flower
but
the
flower
is
trampled
yet
we
build
a
fence
round
my
heart
beat
so
fast
that
i
had
to
put
my
hand
over
it
i
wondered
if
i
were
going
to
have
and
i
knew
grandmother
would
say
digitalis
when
i
thought
of
that
i
laughed
and
lorraine
called
out
who
there
she
came
to
the
long
window
why
peggy
child
said
she
come
she
had
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
forward
they
got
up
as
i
stepped
in
charles
edward
and
stillman
dane
then
i
knew
why
i
was
glad
if
stillman
dane
had
been
here
all
these
dreadful
things
would
not
have
happened
because
he
is
a
psychologist
and
he
would
have
understood
everybody
at
once
and
influenced
them
before
they
had
time
to
do
wrong
jove
said
charles
edward
do
you
look
handsome
peg
goose
said
lorraine
as
if
she
wanted
him
to
be
still
a
good
neat
girl
is
always
handsome
there
an
epigram
for
you
and
peggy
hair
is
loose
in
three
places
let
me
fix
it
for
you
so
we
all
laughed
and
lorraine
pinned
me
up
in
a
queer
tender
way
as
if
she
were
mother
for
something
important
and
we
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
about
college
i
am
afraid
stillman
dane
and
i
did
most
of
the
talking
for
lorraine
and
charles
edward
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
a
little
in
a
fashion
they
have
as
if
they
understood
each
other
and
lorraine
got
up
to
show
him
the
bag
she
had
bought
that
day
for
the
steamer
and
while
she
was
holding
it
out
to
him
and
asking
him
if
it
cost
too
much
she
stopped
short
and
called
out
sharply
who
there
i
laughed
lorraine
has
the
sharpest
ears
i
said
ears
said
lorraine
it
is
ears
i
smell
orris
she
coming
dane
will
you
take
peggy
out
of
that
window
into
the
garden
do
yip
either
of
you
while
you
within
gunshot
and
do
appear
till
i
tell
lorraine
came
a
voice
softly
from
the
front
walk
it
was
aunt
elizabeth
she
has
a
way
of
calling
to
announce
herself
in
a
sweet
cooing
tone
i
said
to
charles
edward
once
it
was
like
a
dove
and
he
said
no
my
child
not
doves
but
alice
giggled
and
called
out
quite
loudly
springes
to
catch
woodcock
and
he
shook
his
head
at
her
and
said
you
imp
is
even
shakespeare
hidden
from
you
but
now
the
voice
did
sound
sweet
to
me
at
all
because
i
wanted
to
get
away
we
rose
at
the
same
minute
dane
and
i
and
lorraine
seemed
to
waft
us
from
the
house
on
a
kind
little
wind
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
we
stopped
for
fear
the
gravel
should
crunch
and
while
we
waited
for
aunt
elizabeth
to
go
in
the
other
way
i
looked
at
dane
to
see
if
he
wanted
to
laugh
as
much
as
i
he
did
his
eyes
were
full
of
fun
and
pleasure
and
he
gave
me
a
little
nod
as
if
we
were
two
children
going
to
play
a
game
we
knew
all
about
then
i
heard
aunt
elizabeth
voice
inside
it
was
low
and
broken
what
charles
edward
called
once
her
voice
dears
said
she
you
are
going
abroad
yes
charles
edward
answered
yes
it
looks
that
way
yes
said
lorraine
rather
sharply
i
thought
as
if
she
meant
to
show
him
he
ought
to
be
more
decisive
we
dears
aunt
elizabeth
went
on
will
you
take
me
with
you
dane
started
as
if
he
meant
to
go
back
into
the
house
i
must
have
started
too
and
my
heart
beat
hard
there
was
a
silence
of
a
minute
two
minutes
three
perhaps
then
i
heard
charles
edward
speak
in
a
voice
i
did
know
he
had
no
aunt
elizabeth
no
not
so
you
notice
dane
gave
a
nod
as
if
he
were
relieved
and
we
both
began
tiptoeing
down
the
path
in
the
dark
but
it
was
dark
any
more
the
moon
was
coming
through
the
and
i
smelled
the
lindens
by
the
wall
oh
i
said
it
summer
is
it
i
do
believe
i
thought
of
summer
once
this
yes
said
he
and
there
never
was
a
summer
such
as
this
is
going
to
i
knew
he
was
very
athletic
but
i
do
believe
i
thought
how
much
he
cared
for
come
down
here
i
said
this
is
jungle
there
a
seat
in
it
and
we
can
smell
the
charles
edward
had
been
watering
the
garden
and
everything
was
sweet
thousands
of
odors
came
out
such
as
i
never
smelled
before
and
all
the
time
the
moon
was
rising
after
we
had
sat
there
awhile
talking
a
little
about
college
about
my
trip
abroad
i
suddenly
found
i
could
not
go
on
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
i
felt
as
if
so
good
a
friend
ought
to
know
how
i
had
behaved
for
i
must
have
been
very
weak
and
silly
to
make
such
a
mistake
he
ought
to
hear
the
worst
about
me
oh
i
said
do
you
know
what
happened
to
me
he
made
a
little
movement
toward
me
with
both
hands
then
he
took
them
back
and
sat
quite
still
and
said
in
that
kind
voice
i
know
you
are
going
abroad
and
when
you
come
back
you
will
laugh
at
the
dolls
you
played
with
when
you
were
a
but
i
cried
softly
though
because
it
was
just
as
if
i
were
alone
thinking
things
out
and
being
sorry
sorry
for
myself
and
ashamed
until
now
i
never
known
how
ashamed
i
was
do
cry
child
he
was
saying
for
god
sake
do
cry
i
think
it
came
over
me
then
as
it
had
before
that
all
that
part
of
my
life
was
spoiled
i
been
engaged
and
thought
i
liked
somebody
and
now
it
was
all
over
and
done
i
do
know
what
i
crying
for
i
said
at
last
when
i
could
stop
i
suppose
it
because
i
different
now
different
from
the
other
girls
different
from
myself
i
ca
ever
be
happy
any
he
spoke
very
quickly
is
it
because
you
liked
goward
so
much
like
him
i
said
like
harry
goward
why
i
there
i
stopped
because
i
could
think
of
any
word
small
enough
and
i
think
he
understood
for
he
laughed
out
quickly
now
said
he
i
a
psychologist
you
remember
that
do
you
it
used
to
impress
you
a
good
oh
said
i
it
does
impress
me
nobody
has
ever
seemed
so
wise
as
you
nobody
then
it
understood
that
i
a
sage
from
the
orient
i
know
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
and
i
tell
you
a
profound
truth
that
the
only
way
to
stop
thinking
of
a
thing
is
to
stop
thinking
of
it
now
you
not
to
think
of
goward
and
all
this
again
not
a
minute
not
an
instant
do
you
hear
he
sounded
quite
stern
and
i
answered
as
if
i
had
been
in
class
yes
you
are
to
think
of
italy
and
how
blue
the
sea
is
and
germany
and
how
good
the
beer
is
and
charlie
ned
and
lorraine
and
what
trumps
they
are
do
you
hear
yes
sir
said
i
and
because
i
knew
we
were
going
to
part
and
there
would
be
nobody
else
to
advise
me
in
the
same
way
i
went
on
in
a
great
hurry
for
fear
there
should
not
be
time
i
ca
live
at
home
even
after
we
come
back
i
could
never
be
pointed
at
like
aunt
elizabeth
and
have
people
whisper
and
say
i
had
a
disappointment
i
must
make
my
own
life
i
must
have
a
profession
do
you
think
i
could
teach
do
you
think
i
could
learn
to
teach
psychology
he
did
answer
for
a
long
time
and
i
did
dare
look
at
him
though
the
moon
was
so
bright
now
that
i
could
see
how
white
his
hand
was
lying
on
his
knee
and
the
chasing
of
the
ring
on
his
little
finger
it
had
been
his
mother
engagement
ring
he
told
me
once
but
he
spoke
and
very
gently
and
seriously
i
am
sure
you
could
teach
some
things
whether
psychology
but
we
can
talk
of
that
later
there
be
lots
of
time
it
proves
i
am
going
over
on
the
same
steamer
with
charlie
ned
and
lorraine
and
you
are
i
cried
why
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
i
find
the
word
for
it
but
everything
stopped
being
puzzling
and
unhappy
and
looked
clear
and
plain
yes
said
he
it
very
convenient
is
it
we
can
talk
over
your
future
and
you
could
even
take
a
lesson
or
two
in
psychology
but
i
fancy
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
to
do
looking
for
porpoises
and
asking
what
the
run
is
people
are
terribly
busy
at
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
had
never
been
here
before
and
why
was
he
here
now
how
did
you
happen
to
come
i
asked
i
suppose
i
really
felt
as
if
god
sent
him
why
said
he
why
then
he
laughed
well
said
he
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
going
abroad
if
if
certain
things
happened
and
i
needed
to
make
sure
i
did
want
to
write
so
i
ran
down
to
see
charlie
but
could
he
tell
you
said
i
and
had
they
happened
he
laughed
as
if
at
something
i
need
share
no
he
said
the
things
were
going
to
happen
but
i
decided
to
go
i
was
curiouser
and
curiouser
as
lorraine
says
but
i
insisted
what
had
charles
edward
to
do
with
it
there
were
a
great
many
pauses
that
night
as
if
i
think
he
know
what
was
wise
to
say
i
should
imagine
it
would
always
be
so
with
psychologists
they
understand
so
well
what
effect
every
word
will
have
well
to
tell
the
truth
he
answered
at
last
in
a
kind
darling
way
i
wanted
to
make
sure
all
was
well
with
my
favorite
pupil
before
i
left
the
country
i
could
quite
go
without
mr
dane
i
said
you
do
mean
me
yes
he
answered
i
mean
i
could
have
danced
and
sung
with
happiness
oh
said
i
then
i
must
have
been
a
better
scholar
than
i
thought
i
feel
as
if
i
could
teach
psychology
this
you
could
said
he
this
and
we
both
laughed
and
know
after
all
what
we
were
laughing
at
at
least
i
did
but
suddenly
i
was
cold
with
fear
why
i
said
if
you
only
really
decided
to
go
how
do
you
know
you
can
get
a
passage
on
our
ship
because
sweet
lady
reason
said
he
i
used
charlie
ned
telephone
and
found
that
was
a
pretty
name
sweet
lady
reason
we
did
talk
any
more
then
for
a
long
time
because
suddenly
the
moon
seemed
so
bright
and
the
garden
so
sweet
but
all
at
once
i
heard
a
step
on
the
gravel
walk
and
i
knew
who
it
was
that
charles
edward
i
said
he
been
home
with
aunt
elizabeth
we
must
go
no
said
he
no
peggy
there
wo
be
such
another
then
he
laughed
quickly
and
got
up
yes
he
said
there
will
be
such
nights
over
and
over
again
come
peggy
little
psychologist
we
go
we
found
lorraine
and
charles
edward
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
holding
hands
and
looking
at
each
other
you
a
hero
lorraine
was
saying
and
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
and
my
own
particular
do
admire
me
said
charles
edward
or
you
get
me
so
bellicose
i
shall
have
to
challenge
lyman
wilde
poor
old
chap
i
believe
to
my
soul
he
had
the
spirit
to
make
speak
gently
of
lyman
wilde
said
lorraine
i
never
forget
what
we
owe
him
sometimes
i
burn
a
candle
to
his
photograph
i
even
dropped
a
tear
before
it
well
children
she
turned
her
bright
eyes
on
us
as
if
she
liked
us
very
much
and
we
two
stood
facing
them
two
and
it
all
seemed
quite
solemn
suddenly
charles
edward
put
out
his
hand
and
shook
dane
and
they
both
looked
very
much
moved
as
grandmother
would
say
i
had
known
they
liked
each
other
so
well
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
said
lorraine
eleven
by
shrewsbury
clock
i
bake
the
cakes
and
draw
the
gee
whiz
said
dane
i
never
heard
things
like
that
it
sounded
like
billy
and
i
liked
it
i
got
to
catch
that
midnight
for
a
minute
it
seemed
as
if
we
all
stood
shouting
at
one
another
lorraine
asking
him
to
stay
all
night
charles
edward
giving
him
a
cigar
to
smoke
on
the
way
i
explaining
to
lorraine
that
i
sleep
on
the
parlor
sofa
and
leave
the
free
and
dane
declaring
got
a
million
things
to
do
before
sailing
then
he
and
charles
edward
dashed
out
into
the
night
as
alice
would
say
and
i
should
have
thought
it
was
a
dream
that
he
been
there
at
all
except
that
i
felt
his
touch
on
my
hand
and
lorraine
put
her
arms
round
me
and
kissed
me
and
said
now
you
sweet
child
run
and
look
at
the
moonlight
and
dream
and
dream
and
i
do
know
whether
i
slept
that
night
but
if
i
did
i
did
not
dream
the
next
forenoon
i
waited
until
eleven
before
i
went
home
i
wanted
to
be
sure
aunt
elizabeth
was
safely
away
at
whitman
yet
after
all
i
did
not
dread
her
now
i
had
been
told
what
to
do
some
one
was
telling
me
of
a
song
the
other
day
command
me
i
had
been
commanded
to
stop
thinking
of
all
those
things
i
hated
i
had
done
it
mother
met
me
at
the
steps
she
seemed
a
little
anxious
but
when
she
had
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
really
looked
at
me
she
smiled
the
way
i
love
to
see
her
smile
that
a
good
girl
said
she
then
she
added
quickly
as
if
she
thought
i
might
not
like
it
and
ought
to
know
at
once
aunt
elizabeth
saw
denbigh
going
by
to
whitman
and
she
asked
him
to
take
her
did
she
said
i
oh
mother
the
old
white
rose
is
out
there
they
are
back
again
said
mother
he
leaving
her
at
the
well
we
both
waited
for
aunt
elizabeth
to
come
up
the
path
i
picked
the
first
white
rose
and
made
mother
smell
it
and
when
i
had
smelled
it
myself
i
began
to
sing
under
my
breath
come
into
the
garden
maud
because
i
remembered
last
night
hush
child
said
mother
quickly
elizabeth
you
are
tired
come
right
aunt
elizabeth
lip
trembled
a
little
i
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
i
had
never
known
her
to
cry
though
i
had
seen
tears
in
her
eyes
and
i
remember
once
when
she
was
talking
to
denbigh
charles
edward
noticed
them
and
laughed
those
are
not
idle
tears
peg
he
said
to
me
they
getting
in
their
now
i
was
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
stopped
thinking
of
last
night
and
put
it
all
away
it
seemed
cruel
to
be
so
happy
aunt
elizabeth
sat
down
on
the
step
and
mother
brought
her
an
eggnog
it
had
been
all
ready
for
grandmother
and
i
could
see
mother
thought
aunt
elizabeth
needed
it
if
she
was
willing
to
make
grandmother
wait
ada
said
aunt
elizabeth
suddenly
as
she
sipped
it
what
was
denbigh
wife
like
why
said
mother
i
almost
forgotten
he
had
a
wife
it
was
so
long
ago
she
died
in
the
first
year
of
their
aunt
elizabeth
laughed
a
little
almost
as
if
no
one
were
there
he
began
to
talk
about
her
quite
suddenly
this
morning
she
said
it
seems
peg
reminds
him
of
her
he
is
devoted
to
her
memory
that
what
he
said
devoted
to
her
that
good
said
mother
cheerfully
as
if
she
did
know
quite
what
to
say
more
letters
lily
any
for
us
i
could
see
mother
was
very
tender
of
her
for
some
reason
or
she
never
would
have
called
her
lily
for
me
said
aunt
elizabeth
as
if
she
were
tired
from
chataway
a
package
too
it
looks
like
that
seems
to
be
from
her
she
broke
open
the
package
why
said
she
of
all
things
why
that
pretty
engraving
said
mother
looking
over
her
shoulder
she
must
have
thought
they
were
aunt
elizabeth
cards
why
of
all
things
aunt
elizabeth
began
to
flush
pink
and
then
scarlet
she
looked
as
pretty
as
a
rose
but
a
little
angry
i
thought
she
put
up
her
head
rather
haughtily
mrs
chataway
is
very
eccentric
she
said
a
genius
quite
a
genius
in
her
own
line
ada
i
wo
come
down
to
luncheon
this
has
been
sufficient
let
me
have
some
tea
in
my
own
room
at
four
she
got
up
and
her
letter
and
one
of
the
cards
fell
to
the
floor
i
picked
them
up
for
her
and
i
saw
on
the
card
ronald
chataway
magnetic
healer
and
mediumistic
divulger
lost
articles
a
specialty
i
do
know
why
but
i
thought
like
mother
and
aunt
elizabeth
well
of
all
things
but
the
rest
of
that
day
mother
and
i
were
too
busy
to
exchange
a
word
about
chataway
or
even
aunt
elizabeth
we
plunged
into
my
preparations
to
sail
and
talked
dresses
and
hats
and
ran
ribbons
in
things
and
i
burned
letters
and
one
photograph
i
burned
that
without
looking
at
it
and
suddenly
mother
got
up
quickly
and
dropped
her
lapful
of
work
my
stars
said
she
i
forgotten
aunt
it
of
no
consequence
dear
said
aunt
elizabeth
voice
at
the
door
i
asked
katie
to
bring
it
why
said
mother
you
not
going
i
held
my
breath
aunt
elizabeth
looked
so
pretty
she
was
dressed
as
i
never
saw
her
before
a
black
gown
and
a
plain
white
collar
and
a
little
close
black
hat
she
looked
almost
like
some
sister
of
charity
ada
said
she
and
peggy
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
and
it
is
my
particular
desire
that
you
keep
it
from
the
whole
family
they
would
not
understand
i
am
going
to
ally
myself
with
chataway
in
a
connection
which
will
lead
to
the
widest
possible
influence
for
her
and
for
me
in
chataway
letter
she
urges
me
to
join
her
she
says
i
have
enormous
magnetism
and
and
other
do
you
want
me
to
tell
cyrus
said
mother
she
spoke
quite
faintly
you
can
simply
tell
cyrus
that
i
have
gone
to
chataway
said
aunt
elizabeth
you
can
also
tell
him
i
shall
be
too
occupied
to
return
ada
peggy
remember
it
is
the
bruised
herb
that
gives
out
the
sweetest
before
i
could
stop
myself
i
had
laughed
out
of
happiness
i
think
for
i
remembered
how
the
spearmint
had
smelled
in
the
garden
when
stillman
dane
and
i
stepped
on
it
in
the
dark
and
how
bright
the
moon
was
and
i
knew
nobody
could
be
unhappy
very
long
i
telephoned
for
a
carriage
said
aunt
elizabeth
there
it
she
and
mother
were
going
down
the
stairs
and
suddenly
i
felt
i
have
her
go
like
that
oh
aunt
aunt
lily
i
called
stop
i
want
to
speak
to
i
ran
after
her
i
going
to
have
a
profession
too
i
said
i
going
to
devote
my
life
to
it
and
i
am
just
as
glad
as
i
can
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
on
her
soft
pink
cheeks
and
we
both
cried
a
little
then
she
went
away

the

club
new
york
do
you
remember
promise
come
now
if
possible
much
needed
cyrus
this
was
the
telegram
that
peter
handed
me
as
i
came
out
of
the
at
the
universe
and
stood
under
the
lofty
gilded
ceiling
of
the
great
hall
trying
to
find
myself
at
home
again
in
the
democratic
simplicity
of
the
united
states
for
two
years
i
had
been
travelling
in
the
effete
luxurious
orient
as
a
peace
correspondent
for
a
famous
newspaper
sleeping
under
canvas
in
syria
in
mud
houses
in
persia
in
paper
cottages
in
japan
riding
on
through
arabia
on
horseback
through
afghanistan
in
palankeen
through
china
and
faring
on
such
food
as
it
pleased
providence
to
send
the
necessity
of
putting
my
next
book
through
the
press
the
setting
splendors
of
the
east
had
recalled
me
to
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
two
hours
after
i
had
landed
from
the
steamship
thirty
seconds
after
i
had
entered
the
club
there
was
peter
in
his
green
coat
and
brass
buttons
standing
in
the
vast
cool
hall
among
the
immense
columns
of
with
my
telegram
on
a
silver
tray
which
he
presented
to
me
with
a
discreet
expression
of
welcome
in
his
face
as
if
he
hesitated
to
inquire
where
i
had
been
but
ventured
to
hope
that
i
had
enjoyed
my
holiday
and
that
there
was
no
bad
news
in
my
despatch
the
perfection
of
the
whole
thing
brought
me
back
with
a
mild
surprise
to
my
inheritance
as
an
american
and
made
me
dimly
conscious
of
the
point
to
which
new
york
has
carried
republicanism
and
the
simple
life
but
the
telegram
read
hastily
in
the
hall
and
considered
at
leisure
while
i
took
a
late
breakfast
at
my
favorite
table
in
the
long
stately
high
above
the
diminished
roar
of
fifth
avenue
the
telegram
carried
me
out
to
eastridge
that
overgrown
village
among
the
new
york
hills
where
people
still
lived
in
villas
with
in
the
front
windows
and
had
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
attended
church
sociables
and
listened
to
orations
it
was
there
that
i
had
gone
green
from
college
to
take
the
of
that
flapping
sheet
the
eastridge
banner
and
there
i
had
found
cyrus
talbert
beginning
his
work
in
the
factory
the
cleanest
warmest
biggest
heart
of
a
man
that
i
have
known
yet
with
a
that
covered
the
of
his
conscience
like
an
apple
orchard
on
a
limestone
ridge
in
the
of
every
day
he
was
kindly
a
lover
of
laughter
but
when
you
struck
down
to
a
question
of
right
and
wrong
or
rather
when
he
conceived
that
he
heard
the
divine
voice
of
duty
he
became
absolutely
immovable
firm
you
would
call
it
if
you
agreed
with
him
obstinate
if
you
differed
after
all
a
conscience
like
that
is
a
good
thing
to
have
at
the
bottom
of
a
friendship
i
could
be
friends
with
a
man
of
almost
any
religion
but
hardly
with
a
man
of
none
certainly
the
intimacy
that
sprang
up
between
talbert
and
me
was
fruitful
in
all
the
good
things
that
cheer
life
journey
from
day
to
day
and
deep
enough
to
stand
the
strain
of
life
earthquakes
and
tornadoes
there
was
a
that
might
have
split
us
apart
but
it
only
put
the
rivets
into
our
friendship
for
both
of
us
in
that
affair
yes
all
three
of
us
thank
god
played
a
straight
game
there
was
a
time
of
loss
and
sorrow
for
me
when
he
proved
himself
more
true
and
helpful
than
any
brother
that
i
ever
knew
i
was
best
man
at
his
wedding
and
because
he
married
a
girl
that
understood
his
house
became
more
like
a
home
to
me
than
any
other
place
that
my
wandering
life
has
found
i
saw
its
amazing
architectural
proportions
erupt
into
the
pride
of
eastridge
i
saw
cyrus
himself
with
all
his
tastes
and
opinions
by
virtue
of
sheer
honesty
and
human
decency
develop
into
the
unassuming
first
citizen
of
the
town
trusted
even
by
those
who
laughed
at
him
and
honored
most
by
his
opponents
i
saw
his
aggravating
family
of
charming
children
grow
around
him
masterful
maria
aesthetic
charles
edward
pretty
peggy
alice
and
boisterous
billy
each
at
heart
lovable
and
fairly
good
but
taken
in
combination
bewildering
and
perplexing
to
the
last
degree
cyrus
had
a
theory
in
regard
to
the
education
of
children
that
individuality
should
not
be
crushed
give
them
what
they
want
follow
the
line
of
juvenile
insistence
all
the
opportunities
and
no
fetters
this
theory
had
resulted
in
the
production
of
a
collection
of
personalities
around
him
whose
simultaneous
interaction
sometimes
made
his
good
old
head
swim
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
whole
family
including
talbert
preposterous
sister
elizabeth
the
biggest
child
of
the
lot
absolutely
depended
on
the
good
sense
of
cyrus
and
his
wife
and
would
have
been
helpless
without
them
but
as
a
matter
of
education
each
child
had
a
secret
illusion
of
superiority
to
the
parental
standard
and
not
only
made
wild
dashes
at
originality
and
independent
action
but
at
the
same
time
cherished
a
perfect
mania
for
regulating
and
running
all
the
others
independence
was
a
sacred
tradition
in
the
talbert
family
but
interference
was
a
fixed
nervous
habit
and
complication
was
a
chronic
social
state
the
blessed
mother
understood
them
all
because
she
loved
them
all
cyrus
loved
them
all
but
the
only
one
he
thought
he
understood
was
peggy
and
her
he
usually
misunderstood
because
she
was
so
much
like
him
but
he
was
fair
to
them
all
dangerously
fair
except
when
his
subcutaneous
conscience
reproached
him
with
not
doing
his
duty
then
he
would
cut
the
knot
of
family
interference
with
some
tremendous
stroke
of
paternal
decision
unalterable
as
a
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
all
this
was
rolling
through
my
memory
as
i
breakfasted
at
the
universe
and
considered
the
telegram
from
eastridge
do
you
remember
promise
of
course
i
remembered
was
it
likely
that
either
of
us
would
forget
a
thing
like
that
we
were
in
the
dingy
little
room
that
he
called
his
den
it
was
just
after
the
birth
of
his
third
child
i
had
told
my
plan
of
letting
the
staff
of
the
banner
fall
into
other
hands
and
going
out
into
the
world
to
study
the
nations
when
they
were
not
excited
by
war
and
write
about
people
who
were
not
disguised
in
that
a
big
plan
he
said
and
you
go
far
and
be
long
away
at
i
admitted
that
it
was
likely
well
he
continued
laying
down
his
pipe
if
you
ever
are
in
trouble
and
get
back
here
send
word
and
i
i
told
him
that
there
was
little
i
could
do
for
him
or
his
except
to
give
superfluous
advice
but
if
they
ever
needed
me
a
word
would
bring
me
to
them
then
i
laid
down
my
pipe
and
we
stood
up
in
front
of
the
fire
and
shook
hands
that
was
all
the
promise
there
was
but
it
brought
him
down
to
panama
to
get
me
five
years
later
when
i
was
knocked
out
with
the
fever
and
it
would
take
me
back
to
eastridge
now
by
the
first
train
but
what
wasteful
brevity
in
that
phrase
much
needed
what
did
that
mean
why
will
a
man
try
to
put
a
meaning
into
a
telegram
sickness
business
troubles
one
of
those
independent
interfering
children
in
a
scrape
one
thing
i
was
blessedly
sure
of
it
did
not
mean
any
difficulty
between
cyrus
and
his
wife
they
were
of
the
tribe
who
marry
for
love
and
love
for
life
but
the
need
must
be
something
serious
and
urgent
else
he
never
would
have
sent
for
me
with
a
family
like
his
almost
anything
might
happen
perhaps
aunt
elizabeth
i
never
could
feel
any
confidence
in
a
female
who
habitually
dressed
in
pink
or
perhaps
charles
edward
if
that
young
man
artistic
ability
had
been
equal
to
his
sense
of
it
there
would
have
been
less
danger
in
taking
him
into
the
factory
or
probably
maria
with
her
great
head
for
business
oh
maria
i
grant
you
is
like
what
the
french
critic
said
of
the
prophet
habakkuk
capable
de
but
why
puzzle
any
longer
over
that
preposterous
telegram
if
my
friend
talbert
was
in
any
kind
of
trouble
under
the
sun
there
was
just
one
thing
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
him
as
quickly
as
possible
find
when
the
first
train
started
and
arrived
send
a
lucid
despatch
no
expensive
parsimony
in
telegraphing
to
cyrus
talbert
eastridge
massachusetts
i
arrived
this
morning
on
the
dilatoria
and
found
your
telegram
here
expect
me
on
the
noon
train
due
at
eastridge
five
this
afternoon
i
hope
all
will
go
well
count
on
me
always
gerrit
it
was
a
relief
to
find
him
on
the
railway
platform
when
the
train
rolled
in
his
broad
shoulders
as
square
as
ever
his
big
head
showing
only
a
shade
more
of
gray
a
shade
less
of
red
in
its
strawberry
roan
his
face
shining
with
the
welcome
which
he
expressed
as
usual
in
humorous
disguise
here
you
are
he
cried
browner
and
thinner
than
ever
give
me
that
bag
how
did
you
leave
my
friend
the
shah
of
persia
better
i
said
stepping
into
the
open
carriage
since
he
got
on
the
uses
nothing
but
eastridge
and
my
dear
friend
the
empress
of
china
he
asked
as
he
got
in
beside
me
she
has
recovered
her
digestion
i
answered
due
entirely
to
the
abandonment
of
and
the
adoption
of
eastridge
knives
and
forks
but
now
it
my
turn
to
ask
a
question
how
are
you
well
said
he
and
the
whole
family
is
well
and
we
all
grown
tremendously
but
we
have
changed
a
bit
and
the
best
thing
that
has
happened
to
us
for
three
years
is
seeing
you
and
the
factory
i
asked
how
does
the
business
of
metallic
humbug
thrive
all
right
he
answered
there
a
little
slackening
in
just
now
but
knives
are
going
off
like
hot
cakes
the
factory
is
on
a
solid
basis
hard
times
wo
hurt
well
then
said
i
a
little
perplexed
what
in
heaven
name
did
you
mean
by
sending
that
hold
on
said
talbert
gripping
my
knee
and
looking
grave
for
a
moment
just
you
wait
i
need
you
badly
enough
or
else
the
telegram
never
would
have
gone
to
you
i
tell
you
about
it
after
supper
till
then
never
mind
or
rather
no
matter
for
it
nothing
material
after
all
but
there
a
lot
in
it
for
the
i
knew
then
that
he
was
in
one
of
his
fundamental
moods
imperviously
jolly
on
the
surface
inflexibly
puritan
underneath
and
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
let
the
subject
rest
until
he
chose
to
take
it
up
in
earnest
so
we
drove
along
chaffing
and
laughing
until
we
came
to
the
dear
old
ugly
house
the
whole
family
were
waiting
on
the
veranda
to
bid
me
welcome
home
talbert
took
my
hands
with
a
look
that
said
it
all
her
face
had
not
grown
a
shade
older
to
me
since
i
first
knew
her
and
her
eyes
the
moment
you
look
into
them
you
feel
that
she
understands
alice
seemed
to
think
that
she
had
become
too
to
be
kissed
even
by
the
friend
of
the
family
and
i
thought
so
too
but
pretty
peggy
was
of
a
different
mind
there
is
something
about
the
way
that
girl
kisses
an
old
gentleman
that
almost
makes
him
wish
himself
young
again
at
supper
we
had
the
usual
tokens
of
festivity
broiled
chickens
and
and
cool
sliced
tomatoes
and
with
real
strawberries
in
it
how
good
and
clean
it
tasted
after
ispahan
and
bagdad
and
the
usual
family
arguing
and
joking
how
natural
and
wholesome
it
sounded
after
vienna
and
paris
i
thought
maria
looked
rather
strenuous
and
severe
as
if
something
important
were
on
her
mind
and
billy
and
alice
at
moments
had
a
conscious
air
but
charles
edward
and
lorraine
were
distinctly
radiant
and
peggy
was
demurely
jolly
she
sounded
like
her
father
played
on
a
mandolin
after
supper
talbert
took
me
to
the
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
to
smoke
our
first
cigars
were
about
half
burned
out
when
he
began
to
unbosom
himself
i
been
a
fool
he
said
an
idiot
and
what
is
more
an
unnatural
and
neglectful
father
cruel
to
my
children
when
i
meant
to
be
kind
a
shirker
of
my
duty
and
a
bringer
of
trouble
on
those
that
i
love
as
for
example
i
asked
well
it
is
peggy
he
broke
out
you
know
i
like
her
best
of
them
all
next
to
ada
ca
help
it
she
is
nearer
to
me
somehow
the
finest
most
unselfish
little
girl
but
i
been
just
selfish
enough
to
let
her
get
into
trouble
and
be
talked
about
and
have
her
heart
broken
and
now
they
put
her
into
a
position
where
she
absolutely
helpless
a
pawn
in
their
fool
game
and
the
lord
only
knows
what
to
come
of
it
all
unless
he
makes
me
man
enough
to
do
my
from
this
of
course
i
had
to
have
the
whole
story
and
i
must
say
it
seemed
to
me
most
extraordinary
a
flagrant
case
of
idiotic
interference
peggy
had
been
sent
away
to
one
of
those
curious
institutions
that
they
call
a
coeducational
college
chiefly
because
maria
had
said
that
she
ought
to
understand
the
duties
of
modern
womanhood
she
had
gone
without
the
slightest
craving
for
the
higher
education
but
naturally
with
the
idea
of
having
a
good
time
and
apparently
she
had
it
for
she
came
home
engaged
to
a
handsome
amatory
boy
one
of
her
fellow
students
named
goward
at
this
point
aunt
elizabeth
with
her
red
hair
and
pink
frock
had
interfered
and
lured
off
the
goward
who
behaved
in
a
manner
which
appeared
to
me
to
reduce
him
to
a
negligible
quantity
but
the
family
evidently
did
not
think
so
for
they
all
promptly
began
to
interfere
maria
and
charles
edward
and
alice
and
even
billy
each
one
with
an
independent
plan
either
to
lure
the
goward
back
or
to
eliminate
him
alice
had
the
most
original
idea
which
was
to
marry
peggy
to
denbigh
but
this
clashed
with
idea
which
was
to
entangle
the
doctor
with
aunt
elizabeth
in
order
that
the
goward
might
be
recaptured
it
was
all
extremely
complicated
and
unnecessary
from
my
point
of
view
and
of
course
it
transpired
and
circulated
through
the
gossip
of
the
town
and
poor
peggy
was
much
afflicted
and
ashamed
now
the
engagement
was
off
aunt
elizabeth
had
gone
into
business
with
a
clairvoyant
woman
in
new
york
goward
was
in
the
hospital
with
a
broken
arm
and
peggy
was
booked
to
go
to
europe
on
saturday
with
charles
edward
and
lorraine
quite
right
i
exclaimed
at
this
point
in
the
story
everything
has
turned
out
just
as
it
should
like
a
romance
in
an
not
at
all
broke
out
talbert
you
do
know
the
whole
of
it
maria
has
told
me
oh
my
prophetic
soul
maria
that
charley
and
his
wife
have
asked
a
friend
of
theirs
a
man
named
dane
ten
years
older
than
peggy
a
professor
in
that
blank
coeducational
college
to
go
with
them
and
that
she
is
sure
they
mean
to
make
her
marry
what
dane
is
that
i
interrupted
is
his
first
name
stillman
nephew
of
my
old
friend
harvey
dane
the
publisher
because
if
that
so
i
know
him
about
years
old
good
family
good
head
good
manners
good
principles
just
the
right
age
and
the
right
kind
for
peggy
a
very
fine
fellow
that
makes
no
difference
continued
cyrus
fiercely
i
do
care
whose
nephew
he
is
nor
how
old
he
is
nor
what
his
manners
are
my
point
is
that
peggy
positively
shall
not
be
pushed
or
inveigled
or
dragooned
or
personally
conducted
into
marrying
anybody
at
all
billy
and
alice
were
wandering
around
charley
garden
last
friday
night
and
they
report
that
professor
dane
was
there
with
peggy
alice
says
that
she
looked
pale
and
drooping
the
bride
of
lammermoor
there
has
been
enough
of
this
meddling
with
my
little
peggy
i
say
and
i
to
blame
for
it
i
do
know
whether
her
heart
is
broken
or
not
i
know
whether
she
still
cares
for
that
fellow
goward
or
not
i
do
know
what
she
wants
to
do
but
whatever
it
is
she
shall
do
it
i
swear
she
be
cajoled
off
to
europe
with
charles
edward
and
lorraine
to
be
flung
at
the
head
of
the
first
professor
who
turns
up
i
do
my
duty
by
my
little
girl
she
shall
stay
at
home
and
be
free
there
has
been
too
much
interference
in
this
family
and
i
damned
if
i
stand
any
more
i
interfere
myself
it
was
not
the
unusual
violence
of
the
language
in
the
last
sentence
that
convinced
me
i
had
often
seen
religious
men
affected
in
that
way
after
an
in
patience
and
mild
behavior
it
was
that
ominous
word
my
duty
which
made
me
sure
that
talbert
had
settled
down
on
the
of
his
conscience
and
was
not
to
be
moved
why
then
had
he
sent
for
me
i
asked
since
he
had
made
up
his
mind
well
said
he
in
the
first
place
i
had
quite
made
it
up
when
i
sent
the
telegram
and
in
the
second
place
now
that
you
have
helped
me
to
see
absolutely
what
is
right
to
do
i
want
you
to
speak
to
my
wife
about
it
she
does
agree
with
me
wants
peggy
to
go
to
europe
thinks
there
can
not
be
any
risk
in
it
you
know
how
she
has
always
adored
charles
edward
will
you
talk
to
her
i
will
said
i
after
a
moment
of
reflection
on
one
condition
you
may
forbid
peggy
journey
morning
if
you
like
break
it
off
peremptorily
if
you
think
it
your
duty
but
do
give
up
her
on
the
ship
and
if
you
can
be
convinced
between
now
and
saturday
that
the
danger
of
interference
with
her
young
affections
is
removed
and
that
she
really
needs
and
wants
to
go
you
let
her
go
will
you
i
will
said
he
and
with
that
we
threw
away
the
remainder
of
our
second
cigars
and
i
went
up
to
the
side
porch
to
talk
with
talbert
what
we
said
i
leave
you
to
imagine
i
have
always
thought
her
the
truest
and
tenderest
woman
in
the
world
but
i
never
knew
till
that
night
just
how
and
brave
she
was
she
agreed
with
me
that
peggy
affair
up
to
now
more
or
less
foolish
though
distressing
had
now
reached
a
dangerous
stage
a
the
child
was
overwrought
a
wrong
touch
now
might
wreck
her
altogether
but
the
right
touch
or
rather
no
touch
at
all
but
just
an
open
door
before
her
ah
that
was
another
matter
my
plan
was
a
daring
one
it
made
her
tremble
a
little
but
perhaps
it
was
the
best
one
at
all
events
she
could
see
no
other
then
she
stood
up
and
gave
me
both
hands
again
i
will
trust
you
my
friend
said
she
i
know
that
you
love
us
and
our
children
you
shall
do
what
you
think
best
and
i
will
be
satisfied
the
difficulty
with
the
situation
as
i
looked
it
over
carefully
while
indulging
in
a
third
cigar
in
my
bedroom
was
that
the
time
was
desperately
short
it
was
now
one
on
tuesday
morning
about
nine
cyrus
would
perform
his
sacred
duty
of
crushing
his
darling
peggy
by
telling
her
that
she
must
stay
in
eastridge
at
ten
on
saturday
the
chromatic
would
sail
with
charles
edward
and
lorraine
and
stillman
dane
yet
there
were
two
things
that
i
was
sure
of
one
was
that
peggy
ought
to
go
with
them
and
the
other
was
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
but
on
second
thought
i
prefer
to
keep
the
other
thing
for
the
end
of
my
story
my
mind
was
fixed
positively
and
finally
that
the
habit
of
interference
in
the
talbert
family
must
be
broken
up
i
never
could
understand
what
it
is
that
makes
people
so
crazy
to
interfere
especially
in
it
is
a
lunacy
it
is
presuming
irreverent
immoral
intolerable
so
i
worked
out
my
little
plan
and
went
to
sleep
peggy
took
her
father
decree
which
was
administered
to
her
privately
after
breakfast
on
tuesday
most
loyally
of
course
he
could
not
give
her
his
real
reasons
and
so
she
could
not
answer
them
but
when
she
appeared
at
dinner
it
was
clear
in
spite
of
a
slight
rosy
hue
about
her
eyes
that
she
had
decided
to
accept
the
sudden
change
in
the
situation
like
a
angel
which
in
fact
she
is
i
had
run
down
to
whitman
in
the
morning
train
to
make
a
call
on
young
goward
and
found
him
rather
an
amiable
boy
under
the
guard
of
an
adoring
mother
who
thought
him
a
genius
and
was
convinced
that
he
had
been
entrapped
by
designing
young
women
i
agreed
with
her
so
heartily
that
she
left
me
alone
with
him
for
a
his
broken
arm
was
doing
well
his
amatoriness
was
evidently
much
reduced
by
hospital
diet
he
was
in
a
repentant
frame
of
mind
and
assured
me
that
he
knew
he
had
been
an
ass
as
well
as
a
brute
synonymes
dear
boy
and
that
he
was
now
going
west
to
do
some
honest
work
in
the
world
before
he
thought
any
more
about
girls
i
commended
his
manly
decision
he
was
rather
rueful
over
the
notion
that
he
might
have
hurt
miss
talbert
by
his
bad
conduct
i
begged
him
not
to
distress
himself
his
first
duty
now
was
to
get
well
i
asked
him
if
he
would
do
me
the
favor
with
the
permission
of
taking
the
fresh
air
with
his
mother
on
the
terrace
of
the
hospital
about
five
that
afternoon
he
looked
puzzled
but
promised
that
he
would
do
it
and
so
we
parted
after
dinner
i
requested
peggy
to
make
me
happy
by
going
for
a
little
drive
in
the
runabout
with
me
she
came
down
looking
as
fresh
as
a
wild
rose
in
a
soft
white
dress
with
some
kind
of
light
greenery
about
it
and
a
pale
green
sash
around
her
waist
and
her
pretty
sunset
hair
uncovered
if
there
is
any
pleasanter
avocation
for
an
old
fellow
than
driving
in
an
open
buggy
with
a
girl
like
that
i
do
know
it
she
talked
charmingly
about
my
travels
about
her
college
friends
about
eastridge
and
at
last
about
her
disappointment
in
not
going
to
europe
by
this
time
we
were
nearing
the
whitman
hospital
i
suppose
you
have
heard
said
she
looking
down
at
her
bare
hands
and
blushing
perhaps
they
have
told
you
why
i
wanted
especially
to
go
yes
my
dear
child
i
answered
they
have
told
me
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
i
am
heartily
glad
that
it
is
all
over
are
you
more
glad
than
i
can
tell
you
she
answered
frankly
looking
into
my
face
see
said
i
there
is
the
hospital
i
believe
there
is
a
boy
in
there
that
knows
you
name
of
yes
she
said
rather
faintly
looking
down
again
but
not
changing
color
peggy
i
asked
do
you
still
think
now
and
answer
truly
do
you
still
hate
him
she
waited
a
moment
and
then
lifted
her
clear
blue
eyes
to
mine
no
uncle
gerrit
i
do
hate
him
half
as
much
as
i
hate
myself
really
i
do
hate
him
at
all
i
sorry
for
so
am
i
my
dear
said
i
stretching
my
interest
in
the
negligible
youth
a
little
but
he
is
getting
well
and
he
is
going
west
as
soon
as
possible
look
is
that
the
boy
yonder
sitting
on
the
terrace
with
a
fat
lady
probably
his
mother
do
you
feel
that
you
could
bow
to
him
just
to
oblige
me
she
flashed
a
look
at
me
i
do
it
for
that
reason
and
for
another
too
she
said
and
then
she
nodded
her
red
head
in
the
prettiest
way
and
threw
in
an
honest
smile
and
a
wave
of
her
hand
for
good
measure
i
was
proud
of
her
the
boy
stood
up
and
took
off
his
hat
i
could
see
him
blush
a
hundred
feet
away
then
his
mother
evidently
asked
him
a
question
and
he
turned
to
answer
her
and
so
exit
goward
the
end
of
our
drive
was
even
pleasanter
than
the
beginning
peggy
was
much
interested
in
a
casual
remark
expressing
my
pleasure
in
hearing
that
she
had
recently
met
the
nephew
of
one
of
my
very
old
friends
stillman
dane
oh
she
cried
do
you
know
him
is
that
lovely
i
admitted
that
he
was
a
very
good
person
to
know
though
i
had
only
seen
a
little
of
him
about
six
years
ago
but
his
uncle
the
one
who
lately
died
and
left
a
snug
fortune
to
his
favorite
nephew
was
one
of
my
old
bachelor
cronies
in
fact
a
member
of
the
firm
that
published
my
books
if
the
young
man
resembled
his
uncle
he
was
all
right
did
peggy
like
him
why
yes
she
answered
he
was
a
professor
at
our
college
and
all
the
girls
thought
him
a
perfect
dandy
dandy
i
exclaimed
there
was
no
sign
of
an
excessive
devotion
to
dress
when
i
knew
him
it
a
great
pity
oh
she
cried
laughing
i
do
mean
that
it
is
only
a
word
we
girls
use
it
means
the
same
as
when
you
say
very
fine
fellow
from
that
point
we
played
the
stillman
dane
tune
with
variations
until
we
reached
home
very
late
indeed
for
supper
the
domestic
convulsion
caused
by
the
formal
announcement
of
talbert
sudden
decision
had
passed
leaving
visible
traces
maria
was
flushed
but
triumphant
alice
and
billy
had
an
air
of
importance
charles
edward
and
lorraine
were
sarcastically
submissive
cyrus
was
resolutely
jovial
the
only
really
tranquil
one
was
talbert
everything
had
been
arranged
the
whole
family
were
to
go
down
to
new
york
on
thursday
to
stop
at
a
hotel
and
see
the
travellers
off
on
saturday
morning
all
except
peggy
who
was
to
remain
at
home
and
keep
house
that
suits
me
exactly
said
i
for
business
calls
me
to
town
but
i
would
like
to
come
back
here
on
thursday
and
keep
house
with
peggy
if
she
will
let
she
thanked
me
with
a
little
smile
and
so
it
was
settled
cyrus
wanted
to
know
when
we
were
sitting
in
the
arbor
that
night
if
i
did
not
think
he
had
done
right
wonderfully
i
said
he
also
wanted
to
know
if
he
might
not
give
up
that
extra
and
save
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
i
told
him
that
he
must
stick
to
his
bargain
i
was
still
in
the
game
and
then
i
narrated
the
afternoon
incident
at
the
hospital
good
little
peggy
he
cried
that
clears
up
one
of
my
troubles
but
the
great
objection
to
this
european
business
still
holds
she
shall
not
be
i
agreed
with
him
not
a
single
step
the
business
that
called
me
to
new
york
was
stillman
dane
a
most
intelligent
and
young
gentleman
not
at
all
a
beauty
man
not
even
noticeably
academic
he
was
about
the
middle
height
but
very
well
set
up
and
evidently
in
good
health
of
body
and
mind
a
and
energetic
fellow
who
had
been
matured
by
doing
his
work
and
had
himself
well
in
hand
there
was
a
look
in
his
warm
brown
eyes
that
spoke
of
a
heart
unsullied
and
capable
of
the
strongest
and
purest
affection
and
at
the
same
time
certain
lines
about
his
chin
and
his
mouth
mobile
but
not
loose
lipped
promised
that
he
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
of
the
girl
that
he
loved
his
appearance
and
his
manner
were
all
that
i
had
hoped
even
more
for
they
were
not
only
pleasant
but
thoroughly
satisfactory
he
was
courteous
enough
to
conceal
his
slight
surprise
at
my
visit
but
not
skilful
enough
to
disguise
his
interest
in
hearing
that
i
had
just
come
from
the
talberts
i
told
him
of
the
agreement
with
cyrus
talbert
the
subsequent
conversation
with
talbert
peggy
drive
with
me
to
whitman
and
her
views
upon
dandies
and
other
cognate
subjects
then
i
explained
to
him
quite
clearly
what
i
should
conceive
my
duty
to
be
if
i
were
in
his
place
he
assented
warmly
to
my
view
i
added
that
if
there
were
any
difficulties
in
his
mind
i
should
advise
him
to
lay
the
case
before
my
dear
friend
the
reverend
george
alexanderson
of
the
irving
place
church
who
was
an
extraordinarily
sensible
and
human
clergyman
and
to
whom
i
would
give
him
a
personal
letter
stating
the
facts
upon
this
we
shook
hands
heartily
and
i
went
back
to
peggy
on
thursday
morning
the
house
was
delightfully
quiet
and
she
was
perfection
as
a
hostess
i
never
passed
a
pleasanter
afternoon
but
the
evening
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
stillman
dane
who
said
that
he
had
run
up
to
say
that
seemed
quite
polite
and
proper
so
i
begged
them
to
excuse
me
while
i
went
into
the
den
to
write
some
letters
they
were
long
letters
the
next
morning
peggy
was
evidently
flustered
but
divinely
radiant
she
said
that
dane
had
asked
her
to
go
driving
with
him
would
that
be
all
right
i
told
her
that
i
was
sure
it
was
perfectly
right
but
if
they
went
far
they
would
find
me
gone
when
they
returned
for
i
had
changed
my
mind
and
was
going
down
to
new
york
to
see
the
voyagers
off
at
this
peggy
looked
at
me
with
tears
sparkling
in
the
edge
of
her
smile
then
she
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
she
whispered
you
a
dandy
too
give
mother
my
love
and
that
and
that
and
that
well
my
dear
i
answered
i
rather
prefer
to
keep
those
for
myself
but
i
give
her
your
message
and
mind
this
do
you
do
anything
unless
you
really
want
to
do
it
with
all
your
heart
god
bless
you
promise
i
promise
with
all
my
heart
said
she
and
then
her
soft
arms
were
unloosed
from
my
neck
and
she
ran
that
was
the
last
word
i
heard
from
peggy
talbert
on
saturday
morning
all
the
rest
of
us
were
on
the
deck
of
the
chromatic
by
nine
the
usual
farewell
performance
was
in
progress
charles
edward
was
expressing
some
irritation
and
anxiety
over
the
lateness
of
stillman
dane
when
that
young
man
quietly
emerged
from
the
with
peggy
beside
him
in
the
demurest
little
travelling
suit
with
an
immense
of
white
violets
tom
price
was
the
first
to
recover
his
voice
peggy
he
cried
peggy
by
all
that
holy
excuse
me
i
said
mr
and
stillman
dane
and
i
must
firmly
request
every
one
except
and
talbert
senior
to
come
with
me
at
once
to
see
the
second
steward
about
the
seats
in
the
we
got
a
good
place
at
the
end
of
the
pier
to
watch
the
big
boat
swing
out
into
the
river
she
went
very
slowly
at
first
then
with
astonishing
quickness
charles
edward
and
lorraine
were
standing
on
the
peggy
close
beside
them
dane
had
given
her
his
and
she
had
tied
her
handkerchief
to
the
handle
she
was
standing
up
on
a
chair
with
one
of
his
hands
to
steady
her
her
hat
had
slipped
back
on
her
head
the
last
thing
that
we
could
distinguish
on
the
ship
was
that
brave
little
girl
her
red
hair
like
an
aureole
waving
her
flag
of
victory
and
peace
and
now
said
maria
as
we
turned
away
i
have
a
lovely
plan
we
are
all
going
together
to
our
hotel
to
have
lunch
and
after
that
to
the
matinee
at
i
knew
it
was
rude
to
interrupt
but
i
could
not
help
it
pardon
me
dear
maria
i
said
but
you
have
not
got
it
quite
right

tom
are
going
to
escort
alice
and
billy
to
eastridge
with
such
diversions
by
the
way
as

father
and

to
