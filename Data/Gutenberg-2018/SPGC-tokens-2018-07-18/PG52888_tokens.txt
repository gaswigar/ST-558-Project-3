introduction
students
of
vice
whether
teachers
clergymen
social
workers
or
physicians
have
been
laboring
for
years
to
find
the
cause
and
cure
for
vice
and
especially
for
prostitution
they
have
failed
so
far
to
agree
on
either
the
cause
or
the
cure
but
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
upon
one
point
they
have
been
compelled
to
agree
and
that
is
that
of
the
sex
is
one
of
the
strongest
forces
that
sends
young
girls
into
living
this
together
with
the
knowledge
of
the
rapidly
increasing
spread
of
venereal
diseases
and
the
realization
of
their
subtle
nature
has
awakened
us
to
the
need
of
a
saner
and
healthier
attitude
on
the
sex
subject
and
to
the
importance
of
for
boys
and
girls
this
need
has
shown
itself
so
clearly
that
the
question
no
longer
seems
to
be
is
there
need
of
instruction
but
who
shall
instruct
shall
the
mother
or
teacher
instruct
when
shall
such
instruction
be
given
in
childhood
or
in
puberty
these
are
the
points
now
under
discussion
to
the
writer
the
answer
is
simple
the
mother
is
the
logical
person
to
teach
the
child
as
soon
as
questions
arise
for
it
is
to
the
mother
that
the
child
goes
for
information
before
he
enters
the
schoolroom
if
therefore
the
mother
answers
his
questions
truthfully
and
simply
and
satisfies
his
curiosity
she
will
find
that
the
subject
of
sex
ceases
to
be
an
isolated
subject
and
becomes
a
natural
part
of
the
general
learning
a
woman
does
not
need
to
be
a
college
graduate
with
a
special
degree
in
the
study
of
botany
before
she
can
tell
her
child
the
beautiful
truth
of
its
birth
but
she
does
need
to
clear
her
own
mind
of
prudishness
and
to
understand
that
the
procreative
act
is
natural
clean
and
healthful
that
all
nature
is
beautified
through
it
and
consequently
that
it
is
devoid
of
offensiveness
if
the
mother
can
impress
the
child
with
the
beauty
and
wonder
and
sacredness
of
the
sex
functions
she
has
taught
it
the
first
lesson
and
the
teacher
can
elaborate
on
these
teachings
as
the
child
advances
in
school
all
schools
should
teach
anatomy
of
the
sex
organs
and
their
physiology
instead
of
teaching
the
human
body
in
the
neuter
gender
as
has
been
done
up
to
this
time
the
whole
object
of
teaching
the
child
about
reproduction
through
evolution
is
to
clear
its
mind
of
any
shame
or
mystery
concerning
its
birth
and
to
impress
it
with
the
beauty
and
naturalness
of
procreation
in
order
to
prepare
it
for
the
knowledge
of
puberty
and
marriage
there
must
of
necessity
be
special
information
for
the
pubescent
boy
and
girl
for
having
arrived
at
the
stage
in
their
mental
development
they
no
longer
take
for
granted
what
has
been
told
them
by
the
parents
but
are
keen
to
form
their
own
ideas
and
gather
information
independently
it
is
right
therefore
to
give
them
the
facts
as
science
has
found
them
there
are
workers
and
philanthropists
who
say
there
is
too
much
stress
put
upon
the
subject
of
venereal
diseases
that
the
young
girl
after
learning
or
hearing
of
the
dangers
she
is
likely
to
encounter
in
the
sexual
relation
is
afraid
to
marry
and
consequently
lives
a
life
unloved
and
alone
your
treatment
of
this
subject
is
dangerous
said
a
very
earnest
social
worker
a
few
weeks
ago
such
knowledge
will
prevent
our
young
girls
from
to
which
i
replied
that
my
object
in
telling
young
girls
the
truth
is
for
the
definite
purpose
of
preventing
them
from
entering
into
sexual
relations
whether
in
marriage
or
out
of
it
without
thinking
and
knowing
better
a
thousand
times
to
live
alone
and
unloved
than
to
be
tied
to
a
man
who
has
robbed
her
of
health
or
of
the
joy
of
motherhood
or
welcoming
the
pains
of
motherhood
live
in
anxiety
lest
her
sickly
offspring
be
taken
out
of
her
life
or
grow
up
a
chronic
invalid
i
have
more
faith
in
the
force
of
love
i
believe
that
two
people
convinced
that
they
love
each
other
and
desire
to
live
together
will
talk
as
frankly
of
their
own
health
and
natures
as
they
do
today
of
the
house
furnishings
and
salaries
their
love
for
each
other
will
protect
them
from
ill
health
and
disease
and
prompt
them
to
procure
of
their
own
accord
a
certificate
of
health
if
each
has
the
right
information
and
knowledge
there
are
however
different
phases
of
nature
the
knowledge
of
which
binds
and
cements
the
love
of
two
people
other
than
venereal
diseases
for
these
diseases
are
only
symptoms
of
a
great
social
disorder
every
girl
should
first
understand
herself
she
should
know
her
anatomy
including
sex
anatomy
she
should
know
the
epochs
of
a
normal
life
and
the
unfoldment
which
each
epoch
brings
she
should
know
the
effect
the
emotions
have
on
her
acts
and
finally
she
should
know
the
fullness
and
richness
of
life
when
crowned
by
the
flower
of
motherhood
this
knowledge
i
shall
endeavor
to
give
in
the
following
articles
fragmentary
the
articles
must
of
necessity
be
for
there
are
volumes
written
on
each
subject
i
shall
try
to
free
the
subjects
from
technicalities
and
give
the
opinions
of
writers
who
have
made
these
subjects
their
life
studies
and
also
the
facts
as
i
myself
have
learned
them
it
is
not
my
intention
to
thrust
upon
any
one
a
special
code
of
morals
or
to
inflict
upon
the
readers
my
own
ideals
of
morality
i
only
presume
to
present
the
facts
for
you
to
accept
according
to
your
understanding
the
first
subject
will
deal
with
the
girl
during
the
age
when
sex
first
manifests
itself
in
that
most
fascinating
interesting
and
puzzling
period
of
a
woman
budding
period
called
girlhood
chapter
ii
i
the
physical
manifestations
it
has
been
said
that
the
american
girl
between
the
ages
of
and
is
the
most
neglected
girl
in
the
world
just
why
this
is
so
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
i
doubt
whether
she
is
alone
in
this
neglect
for
this
is
known
as
the
and
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
years
that
the
mental
and
physiological
aspect
of
this
period
has
been
at
all
considered
or
its
importance
recognized
in
any
part
of
the
world
the
is
the
time
occupied
between
the
ages
of
and
when
the
physical
development
comes
suddenly
into
prominence
when
the
mental
faculties
become
independently
active
and
the
sex
of
the
individual
strongly
manifests
itself
it
is
a
period
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
girl
herself
for
her
physical
mental
and
moral
development
during
this
time
will
have
an
important
effect
on
her
future
life
it
is
also
a
period
of
the
greatest
interest
to
the
mother
provided
there
is
sympathy
confidence
and
understanding
between
them
too
much
importance
can
not
be
attached
to
the
necessity
of
an
early
confidence
between
the
girl
and
her
mother
before
this
period
arrives
for
this
will
give
a
girl
a
sense
of
superiority
a
poise
an
understanding
of
herself
and
her
nature
she
will
then
be
prepared
for
the
changes
taking
place
within
herself
and
consequently
be
practically
immune
from
the
influence
of
a
bad
environment
which
otherwise
might
affect
her
in
a
way
detrimental
to
her
health
and
happiness
up
to
this
period
there
is
very
little
manifestation
of
sex
fortunately
we
have
come
to
recognize
that
healthy
outdoor
play
is
as
good
for
the
little
girl
as
it
is
for
the
boy
and
the
ideas
of
our
grandmothers
boys
were
to
play
ball
ride
horseback
swim
shoot
while
the
girl
play
was
restricted
to
sedentary
pursuits
such
as
sewing
doll
playing
been
placed
on
the
relic
heap
and
the
girl
of
today
keeps
pace
with
her
brother
in
physical
freedom
and
activity
with
the
passing
of
those
ideas
passed
also
our
ideal
of
the
delicate
girl
with
a
cough
small
waist
and
dainty
appetite
and
the
girl
physically
strong
and
healthy
with
a
broader
view
of
life
has
taken
her
place
about
the
age
of
there
comes
a
sudden
change
in
the
girl
her
dresses
are
outgrown
her
form
assumes
shape
her
bust
and
limbs
develop
and
in
the
words
of
stanley
hall
hips
thighs
limbs
shoulders
and
arms
round
out
into
contours
more
or
less
beautiful
curves
always
predominating
over
thus
we
come
to
realize
that
the
little
girl
has
left
us
the
physical
development
is
not
alone
in
this
work
for
the
mental
and
moral
instincts
are
developing
so
rapidly
that
it
is
difficult
to
understand
this
new
and
lovely
creature
who
is
neither
the
child
of
yesterday
nor
the
woman
of
tomorrow
there
is
often
very
little
patience
shown
the
adolescent
girl
for
neither
parents
nor
teachers
have
been
aware
that
this
is
a
separate
and
distinct
passing
from
childhood
into
as
such
must
be
recognized
let
us
first
take
the
bony
structure
it
is
a
well
known
fact
that
there
is
not
sufficient
lime
salts
in
the
system
to
complete
the
bony
structure
until
the
year
the
bones
are
not
completely
hardened
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
so
many
deformities
have
their
foundation
laid
at
this
time
the
first
and
most
noticeable
change
in
the
girl
at
this
age
is
the
increase
of
height
which
begins
at
the
year
and
ends
about
the
there
are
girls
who
begin
earlier
and
continue
to
grow
for
several
years
after
this
age
but
it
is
with
the
average
we
deal
and
the
growth
after
the
age
of
is
not
so
perceptible
many
girls
show
almost
no
other
signs
of
womanly
development
until
after
this
growth
has
ceased
the
bones
at
this
time
are
soft
enough
to
yield
to
pressure
being
cartilaginous
which
makes
the
wearing
of
a
corset
especially
dangerous
for
the
pressure
on
the
ribs
interferes
with
the
development
of
the
lungs
and
tuberculosis
is
more
easily
contracted
corsets
should
not
be
worn
before
the
year
if
possible
and
then
very
loosely
for
tight
lacing
is
more
harmful
at
this
age
than
a
few
years
later
those
who
have
made
careful
investigations
of
the
harmful
effects
of
corsets
claim
that
not
only
are
the
chest
and
walls
of
the
abdomen
injured
but
the
development
of
the
sexual
organs
is
seriously
hampered
causing
many
functional
diseases
commonly
painful
and
irregular
menstruation
caused
by
arrested
development
of
the
cervix
the
girl
who
scoffs
at
the
idea
of
the
chinese
women
binding
up
their
feet
is
doubtless
ignorant
of
the
knowledge
that
to
bind
up
their
own
thoracic
and
pelvic
structures
the
chest
and
abdominal
portions
of
her
body
in
tight
corsets
is
doing
greater
harm
to
her
health
and
injury
to
her
development
than
the
binding
of
the
feet
could
possibly
do
ellis
brings
forth
a
few
words
on
this
subject
which
shows
that
the
habit
of
binding
the
feet
of
the
chinese
women
is
based
on
the
same
ideas
as
the
european
woman
has
when
she
deforms
her
are
both
done
for
sexual
attractiveness
a
chinese
woman
foot
is
more
interesting
than
her
her
husband
no
man
of
good
breeding
would
look
at
a
chinese
woman
foot
in
the
street
such
an
act
is
most
indelicate
this
question
of
corsets
every
girl
should
consider
seriously
as
this
rapid
growth
begins
the
girl
often
finds
it
difficult
to
hold
herself
up
straight
her
shoulders
become
stooped
her
head
and
neck
are
thrust
forward
in
a
most
ungainly
manner
as
she
becomes
conscious
of
this
instead
of
correcting
it
she
is
likely
to
slouch
and
assume
the
most
awkward
habits
her
arms
seem
longer
to
her
hands
legs
and
feet
become
new
burdens
to
carry
and
the
desire
to
hide
the
hands
behind
the
back
to
fold
the
arms
to
bend
one
knee
in
order
to
lessen
the
length
of
the
body
and
to
lean
on
something
while
talking
are
all
signs
of
this
consciousness
with
the
invention
of
modern
machinery
and
the
monotony
of
specialized
work
in
the
mills
and
factories
it
is
natural
that
this
should
bring
with
it
if
not
entirely
new
diseases
and
deformities
at
least
a
greater
number
than
have
heretofore
been
known
consider
the
little
children
in
the
cotton
mills
standing
for
long
periods
with
the
weight
of
the
body
thrown
on
one
position
which
causes
curvature
of
the
spine
again
consider
the
young
girls
still
in
their
teens
bending
over
sewing
machines
from
morning
until
night
from
year
to
year
their
premium
for
this
work
is
right
sided
lateral
curvature
sitting
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
as
in
sewing
carrying
books
under
the
arm
to
and
from
school
lifting
and
carrying
heavy
burdens
bundles
or
small
children
such
as
the
abused
and
deformed
little
mothers
spend
their
play
time
in
cause
curvature
of
the
spine
curvature
is
one
of
the
most
common
deformities
any
position
which
throws
the
spinal
column
out
of
its
natural
line
for
any
length
of
time
is
likely
to
produce
it
regular
exercise
in
the
open
air
will
do
much
to
prevent
this
together
with
walking
and
dancing
if
curvature
is
already
noticeable
then
it
is
best
to
get
professional
instructions
and
follow
them
closely
next
to
the
rapid
bony
development
the
changes
in
the
heart
and
circulation
are
most
noticeable
the
heart
grows
more
rapidly
during
the
adolescent
age
than
the
arteries
do
which
increases
the
supply
of
blood
in
the
arteries
and
causes
general
circulatory
disturbance
of
which
we
see
many
outward
signs
such
as
blushing
nose
bleed
headache
cold
feet
and
hands
anaemia
loss
of
appetite
or
an
appetite
so
capricious
as
to
drive
one
frantic
trying
to
satisfy
it
for
it
jumps
from
ice
cream
soda
to
dill
pickles
according
to
whim
some
of
these
symptoms
require
special
attention
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
girl
at
school
or
in
an
office
who
finds
her
work
a
great
effort
tires
easily
and
becomes
pale
and
nervous
such
a
girl
should
spend
as
much
time
as
possible
in
the
open
air
and
build
up
on
milk
and
eggs
sometimes
a
simple
iron
tonic
will
do
much
to
overcome
these
disturbances
pimples
on
the
face
are
also
very
common
at
this
period
physicians
assert
that
with
cleanliness
of
the
skin
and
regularity
of
the
bowels
these
symptoms
will
disappear
without
the
aid
of
medicines
or
cosmetics
the
above
mentioned
symptoms
are
of
great
annoyance
to
the
adolescent
girl
who
is
just
developing
pride
in
looking
neat
and
keeping
up
an
appearance
of
daintiness
and
she
goes
to
unending
trouble
to
rid
herself
of
facial
blemishes
which
often
seem
to
grow
worse
and
if
tampered
with
leave
ugly
scars
the
nervous
system
also
undergoes
great
changes
at
this
age
and
the
growing
girl
is
subject
to
various
forms
of
nervous
affections
stammering
jerking
restlessness
etc
these
are
symptoms
which
if
allowed
to
continue
unattended
may
develop
into
permanent
disorders
in
short
the
adolescent
girl
needs
constant
watchfulness
and
attention
ii
the
organs
of
sense
are
also
awakened
to
activity
in
the
adolescent
girl
the
sense
of
smell
becomes
extremely
acute
offensive
odors
are
offensive
while
pleasant
ones
are
greatly
enjoyed
and
desired
thus
we
find
perfumes
used
lavishly
in
girlhood
and
alas
too
often
indiscriminately
with
the
development
of
the
other
senses
the
sense
of
color
is
awakened
the
girl
who
yesterday
allowed
her
elders
to
choose
clothing
and
colors
for
her
at
this
time
becomes
most
exacting
in
her
own
selection
of
ribbons
and
dresses
sunsets
and
forests
have
become
beautiful
and
often
the
girl
with
artistic
talent
decides
at
this
age
to
choose
her
life
work
laces
jewelry
trinkets
ribbons
and
shop
windows
become
her
world
indeed
so
great
is
her
desire
to
possess
ornaments
that
she
has
been
known
to
resort
to
petty
thievery
when
unable
to
avail
herself
of
the
means
to
obtain
them
otherwise
certain
authorities
who
have
made
vice
and
kindred
subjects
a
study
assert
that
it
is
this
great
desire
for
trinkets
silk
petticoats
which
induces
girls
to
sell
their
bodies
and
enter
prostitution
such
authorities
fail
to
see
the
economic
significance
of
these
unsatisfied
desires
there
is
something
wrong
with
a
system
of
society
which
allows
its
women
to
sell
their
bodies
for
such
trifles
the
desire
for
which
is
part
of
their
natural
development
is
flesh
and
blood
and
the
virtue
of
the
mothers
of
the
future
so
cheap
in
this
land
of
plenty
that
it
can
be
sacrificed
for
such
passing
whims
it
is
impossible
to
suppress
that
inherent
and
natural
desire
in
the
adolescent
girl
to
adorn
and
beautify
herself
she
must
and
will
do
it
the
girl
of
wealth
of
the
upper
class
can
beautify
herself
and
adorn
her
body
with
the
costliest
jewels
and
fabrics
all
eyes
are
upon
her
in
admiration
of
her
exquisite
taste
and
attractive
appearance
yet
this
same
manifestation
in
a
working
girl
is
condemned
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
a
working
girl
to
give
expression
to
the
desire
to
be
beautiful
is
considered
dangerous
to
her
welfare
is
spoken
of
as
her
awful
desire
for
the
women
of
wealth
set
certain
standards
for
themselves
and
their
class
but
separate
and
distinct
standards
for
the
women
of
the
working
class
it
is
about
time
the
reformers
and
philanthropists
do
something
other
than
deal
with
the
symptoms
of
the
great
social
unrest
and
some
of
the
latest
reports
of
vice
investigators
have
been
compelled
to
face
some
of
the
most
fundamental
causes
and
acknowledged
these
causes
a
craving
for
beauty
and
pleasure
dancing
music
singing
and
laughter
an
innate
hereditary
desire
to
adorn
and
beautify
herself
which
comes
down
to
her
from
primitive
woman
together
with
a
burning
desire
for
and
love
of
romance
characterize
the
adolescent
girl
and
often
remain
with
her
far
beyond
the
adolescent
age
when
the
imagination
is
thus
aroused
it
is
not
unusual
to
learn
that
the
young
girl
yields
to
it
tells
strange
tales
about
herself
and
is
therefore
often
accused
of
lying
but
this
and
petty
thievery
disappear
as
reason
and
will
power
are
developed
the
change
of
voice
in
a
girl
is
not
so
distinct
as
in
a
boy
but
the
voice
gradually
becomes
softer
fuller
and
of
a
more
womanly
pitch
though
the
change
is
quite
unnoticeable
while
it
occurs
the
hearing
becomes
keener
noises
which
a
few
months
ago
were
considered
a
joke
are
now
disturbing
such
as
father
loud
sneeze
music
and
singing
have
charms
which
in
childhood
were
unappreciated
parents
and
teachers
who
do
not
appreciate
the
change
taking
place
within
the
girl
at
this
period
have
small
patience
with
such
doings
calling
her
giddy
and
affected
when
in
reality
it
is
all
part
of
her
development
and
can
be
guided
and
directed
into
beautiful
channels
together
with
her
personal
adornment
comes
interest
in
her
surroundings
new
and
elaborate
decorations
furnish
her
bedroom
and
toilet
accessories
become
objects
of
pride
primitive
colors
are
displayed
largely
in
curtains
bed
coverings
wall
paper
all
of
which
explain
the
independent
ego
in
the
stage
of
transition
there
are
many
forms
of
disturbance
which
the
girl
suffers
at
this
period
such
as
hysteria
and
insanity
which
however
we
will
not
dwell
upon
here
enough
has
been
said
on
the
subject
to
impress
upon
my
readers
the
cause
of
these
physical
and
mental
disturbances
and
to
realize
that
special
care
and
consideration
should
be
given
at
this
particular
age
of
the
girl
the
emotional
nature
also
plays
a
most
prominent
part
in
the
developing
girl
and
justice
i
feel
would
not
be
shown
her
here
unless
we
cover
briefly
this
most
interesting
part
of
her
nature
one
of
the
strongest
emotions
which
very
few
girls
passing
from
childhood
into
womanhood
escape
is
the
religious
awakening
of
one
kind
or
another
it
is
said
by
some
investigators
that
per
cent
of
the
conversions
of
women
in
the
churches
take
place
before
the
age
of
from
to
years
only
a
very
small
percentage
like
or
per
cent
it
is
also
shown
that
more
young
girls
join
church
than
boys
some
girls
seem
almost
consumed
by
the
desire
to
do
good
and
be
good
in
every
thought
and
word
and
act
and
have
been
known
to
go
through
various
forms
of
self
punishment
such
as
fasting
sacrificing
pleasure
etc
again
others
spend
hours
in
absolute
devotion
to
the
neglect
of
health
and
studies
it
is
very
easily
seen
why
the
church
takes
its
flock
while
still
in
the
adolescent
period
for
at
no
subsequent
time
is
the
girl
mind
so
plastic
or
impressionable
if
the
same
girl
who
enters
the
convent
at
years
had
waited
until
she
would
very
likely
not
have
entered
for
the
mental
changes
are
most
intense
from
to
years
of
age
another
common
emotional
awakening
of
girlhood
is
the
affections
in
boys
this
awakening
causes
them
to
gather
together
in
gangs
they
follow
their
leader
whom
they
greatly
admire
and
obey
in
girls
it
assumes
a
more
simple
form
the
devotion
to
a
girl
friend
of
her
own
age
and
the
affection
between
them
is
deep
and
intense
while
it
lasts
they
tell
their
most
private
thoughts
in
secret
to
each
other
dividing
all
honors
pleasures
and
gifts
they
are
almost
inseparable
and
i
have
known
a
girl
whose
affection
was
so
deep
for
her
chum
that
she
wore
mourning
when
the
chum
father
died
another
form
of
affection
which
the
girl
of
this
age
manifests
is
that
for
an
older
woman
often
a
teacher
or
neighbor
parents
sometimes
look
askance
at
this
relation
and
rightly
so
for
a
friendship
can
be
beneficial
or
harmful
according
to
the
character
of
the
older
woman
but
with
all
these
interests
there
is
nothing
so
or
so
interesting
to
the
adolescent
girl
as
she
has
become
conscious
of
now
she
burns
with
ambition
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
do
mighty
things
she
feels
sure
she
will
be
a
great
singer
or
a
dancer
or
perhaps
an
actress
again
she
feels
she
will
write
a
wonderful
at
least
she
will
be
the
heroine
or
she
will
write
a
wonderful
tragic
play
or
she
will
nurse
on
the
battlefields
and
care
for
the
sick
and
dying
these
together
with
thousands
of
other
desires
burn
in
her
mind
and
can
be
increased
or
lessened
according
to
the
character
of
the
books
she
reads
the
literature
placed
in
a
girl
hands
at
this
age
has
as
great
an
influence
on
her
thoughts
and
acts
as
her
companions
in
early
adolescence
this
manifests
itself
in
modesty
blushing
giggling
physical
awkwardness
mentioned
earlier
on
this
subject
all
signs
that
the
girl
is
conscious
of
that
inner
ego
it
is
at
this
stage
when
the
mother
tries
to
explain
what
the
menstrual
period
means
to
the
girl
that
she
is
met
with
icy
indifference
she
refuses
to
talk
on
this
subject
or
anything
pertaining
to
the
sex
subject
because
she
has
just
become
conscious
of
her
sex
and
everything
connected
with
it
seems
offensively
personal
she
most
likely
has
received
her
sexual
information
from
some
one
else
and
the
mother
is
astonished
at
the
stubborn
silence
on
the
part
of
her
daughter
she
fails
to
realize
that
some
one
else
has
that
confidence
which
belongs
to
her
and
which
she
should
have
gained
many
years
earlier
there
is
a
strong
tie
between
the
adolescent
girl
and
her
sexual
informant
the
influence
of
an
older
girl
over
a
younger
between
whom
there
are
confidences
regarding
sex
is
surprisingly
great
the
mind
at
this
age
is
very
susceptible
to
influences
of
any
kind
and
the
ideals
instilled
into
a
girl
mind
are
of
paramount
importance
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
disturbances
of
the
adolescent
girl
but
they
are
sufficient
for
us
to
know
that
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
disturbances
is
the
mysterious
influence
of
sex
gradually
unfolding
itself
and
finally
claiming
its
own
at
the
time
these
emotions
are
in
full
sway
along
comes
a
newer
and
deeper
one
the
boy
with
whom
she
has
played
for
the
past
several
years
run
races
played
house
ball
and
games
one
day
looks
into
her
something
happens
perhaps
that
look
was
accompanied
by
a
pull
at
her
hair
a
pinch
on
her
arm
or
a
hit
with
an
apple
core
but
the
glance
was
one
which
awakened
within
her
a
new
instinct
the
consciousness
of
sex
and
upon
her
horizon
man
appears
those
who
have
investigated
boy
and
girl
love
affairs
seem
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
they
are
invariably
of
short
duration
out
of
high
school
girls
interrogated
two
had
married
while
at
school
and
one
of
these
had
received
a
divorce
shortly
after
this
goes
to
prove
that
the
boy
a
girl
is
willing
to
elope
with
or
even
starve
for
at
is
quite
forgotten
at
the
age
of
when
girls
marry
between
the
ages
of
and
years
when
they
are
developing
in
body
mind
and
character
they
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
themselves
because
they
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
wonderful
instinct
of
sex
is
making
itself
felt
for
thousands
of
years
this
instinct
has
been
in
the
germ
of
life
when
they
have
reached
that
age
nature
is
preparing
them
to
proclaim
its
right
to
perform
their
natural
functions
to
propagate
as
the
knowledge
of
the
sex
functions
is
one
of
the
most
important
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
girl
we
shall
now
consider
the
girl
in
the
period
when
nature
has
developed
and
prepared
her
to
carry
out
its
plan
in
the
age
of
puberty
chapter
iii
puberty
is
the
age
at
which
the
girl
or
boy
becomes
capable
of
reproduction
writers
differ
in
the
use
of
the
word
many
use
it
to
denote
the
whole
period
of
time
during
which
the
procreative
ability
continues
which
is
usually
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
year
there
are
still
other
uses
of
the
word
but
we
will
use
it
as
the
age
when
the
boy
or
girl
becomes
sexually
matured
or
ripe
the
first
indication
of
which
is
the
menstrual
flow
in
the
girl
and
seminal
emissions
in
the
boy
this
sign
of
puberty
is
celebrated
by
initiations
among
the
savage
peoples
mostly
for
the
purpose
of
trying
the
powers
of
endurance
in
the
boy
or
girl
the
boy
is
taken
away
among
strange
tribes
is
subjected
to
the
greatest
physical
pain
and
hardship
and
among
some
tribes
is
circumcized
the
girl
is
often
subjected
to
a
vaginal
incision
and
should
she
cry
out
or
show
any
sign
of
suffering
she
is
disgraced
among
the
women
of
her
tribe
and
promptly
expelled
from
the
settlement
in
ellis
psychology
of
sex
the
author
relates
of
the
yuman
indians
of
california
how
the
girls
prepare
for
marriage
at
the
first
sign
of
menstruation
by
being
wrapped
in
blankets
and
placed
in
a
warm
pit
for
four
days
and
nights
the
old
women
of
the
tribe
dance
about
them
and
sing
constantly
they
give
away
coin
cloth
and
wheat
to
teach
the
girls
generosity
and
sow
wild
seeds
broadcast
over
the
girls
to
cause
them
to
be
prolific
these
and
various
other
initiations
are
practiced
by
nearly
all
savage
tribes
the
boys
and
girls
receive
their
sex
knowledge
at
this
time
and
are
instructed
in
the
duties
of
married
life
the
girls
are
fully
informed
of
menstruation
it
has
been
said
the
knowledge
of
sexual
relations
is
openly
discussed
and
naturally
taught
that
therefore
it
has
no
glamour
for
them
and
in
consequence
the
women
of
these
tribes
are
virtuous
perhaps
you
will
wonder
what
bearing
all
this
has
on
what
every
girl
should
know
i
relate
it
only
to
show
that
the
savages
have
recognized
the
importance
of
plain
sexual
talks
to
their
young
for
ages
while
civilization
is
still
hiding
itself
under
the
black
pall
of
prudery
when
we
speak
of
puberty
it
is
necessary
to
have
some
knowledge
of
the
organs
of
reproduction
and
their
structure
so
far
the
physiology
taught
in
the
public
schools
has
not
treated
of
these
organs
in
order
to
get
books
on
this
subject
a
girl
is
met
with
the
question
are
you
a
nurse
or
physician
if
not
the
books
are
denied
her
consequently
the
average
girl
is
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
function
of
these
organs
and
is
at
a
loss
to
know
where
to
go
for
clean
information
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
give
this
information
here
without
mincing
words
if
there
is
any
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
following
subject
it
is
very
simple
for
the
girl
to
learn
the
correct
names
of
these
organs
and
call
them
by
such
names
they
are
the
ovaries
fallopian
tubes
uterus
vagina
and
breasts
the
breasts
were
not
always
classed
as
reproductive
organs
but
later
writers
recognize
their
relation
to
them
and
as
such
they
are
now
included
let
us
first
take
the
ovaries
which
are
two
small
illustration
fig
and
to
the
right
the
ovary
and
tube
have
been
laid
open
tube
glands
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
almond
placed
one
on
each
side
of
the
extreme
lower
part
of
the
woman
abdomen
they
are
imbedded
in
large
ligaments
and
tissues
which
also
help
to
hold
the
uterus
the
womb
in
place
inside
the
ovaries
are
thousands
of
little
eggs
called
ovules
which
have
been
there
since
the
birth
of
the
girl
it
is
claimed
there
are
from
twenty
to
fifty
thousand
ovules
in
the
ovary
at
birth
the
work
of
the
ovary
is
to
develop
and
mature
these
eggs
and
send
them
on
to
be
fertilized
at
the
time
of
puberty
these
eggs
are
all
in
different
stages
of
development
those
in
the
center
of
the
ovary
ripen
first
and
burst
through
the
outer
cover
of
the
ovary
which
is
like
a
capsule
and
at
the
time
of
menstruation
becomes
swollen
and
congested
the
ovule
is
caught
by
the
fringy
ends
of
the
fallopian
tubes
which
are
in
a
constant
lashing
motion
which
motion
sends
the
egg
through
the
tube
to
the
uterus
the
fallopian
tubes
are
about
four
and
inches
in
length
and
join
the
ovaries
to
the
upper
and
outer
angle
of
the
uterus
its
duties
are
to
convey
the
ova
from
the
ovary
to
the
uterus
sometimes
the
sperm
cell
from
the
male
comes
up
into
the
tube
to
meet
the
egg
and
it
is
fertilized
here
the
union
of
the
two
cells
usually
occurs
in
the
outer
end
of
the
fallopian
tube
but
this
is
not
the
nest
nature
has
prepared
for
the
egg
development
and
unless
it
returns
into
the
uterus
it
causes
serious
trouble
and
an
operation
is
necessary
impregnation
in
the
tube
is
very
rare
but
it
is
possible
the
uterus
often
spoken
of
as
the
womb
is
a
hollow
muscular
organ
into
which
the
egg
comes
from
the
tubes
to
be
to
eight
days
from
ovaries
to
uterus
after
fertilization
it
remains
here
is
nourished
and
developed
until
it
can
develop
no
more
then
it
is
thrown
out
by
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
which
process
we
call
the
birth
of
a
child
the
uterus
is
about
three
inches
long
its
shape
is
like
a
pear
with
the
small
end
downward
it
is
not
fastened
to
any
of
the
bony
parts
but
is
held
in
place
by
the
ligaments
and
tissues
which
also
allow
it
to
move
with
different
movements
of
the
body
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
about
the
uterus
which
is
so
small
in
its
cavity
is
that
it
can
stretch
to
accommodate
the
growing
child
within
it
to
the
length
of
nineteen
to
inches
this
is
because
it
is
one
and
one
half
inches
thick
and
composed
of
layers
of
muscles
which
are
tough
and
yet
elastic
at
the
upper
side
of
the
uterus
are
the
openings
into
the
fallopian
tubes
at
the
small
end
of
the
uterus
is
another
opening
leading
into
the
vagina
it
is
through
this
opening
the
sperm
of
the
male
comes
in
order
to
fertilize
the
egg
thus
you
can
readily
see
the
uterus
is
the
nest
or
cradle
where
the
egg
is
to
live
until
it
becomes
strong
enough
to
subsist
on
other
nourishment
the
vagina
is
a
muscular
passage
which
extends
from
the
small
part
of
the
uterus
called
the
neck
to
the
outer
surface
of
the
body
where
its
opening
is
usually
partly
closed
in
virgins
by
a
thin
membrane
or
film
known
as
the
hymen
the
walls
of
the
vagina
are
also
very
thick
and
elastic
this
is
sometimes
called
the
birth
canal
the
hymen
was
for
years
a
subject
for
discussion
in
the
professional
world
among
physicians
in
my
talks
to
girls
i
find
it
a
subject
of
great
interest
and
often
anxiety
to
many
of
them
for
the
average
girl
seems
possessed
with
the
old
idea
that
the
presence
of
the
hymen
is
necessary
to
marital
happiness
the
time
was
not
long
ago
when
its
absence
was
considered
cause
for
serious
discord
between
husband
and
wife
and
i
have
been
told
that
under
the
old
law
its
absence
was
sufficient
ground
for
divorce
fortunately
modern
science
has
thrown
some
light
on
this
subject
and
disproved
the
theory
that
its
absence
was
necessarily
due
to
a
having
had
sexual
relations
there
are
cases
on
record
of
women
who
have
lived
four
and
five
years
in
prostitution
who
were
found
with
perfectly
preserved
hymen
it
is
important
to
know
that
it
differs
in
size
and
shape
in
women
also
that
in
some
women
it
has
been
entirely
absent
since
birth
many
little
girls
and
babies
have
no
hymen
it
can
be
destroyed
by
accident
or
injured
by
operations
or
examinations
where
the
physician
did
not
use
the
greatest
care
in
some
women
it
is
easily
destroyed
in
others
it
is
more
difficult
it
is
not
at
all
uncommon
for
a
physician
to
find
the
hymen
unruptured
when
he
comes
to
deliver
the
first
born
child
all
of
which
goes
to
prove
that
neither
its
presence
nor
its
absence
is
necessarily
the
sign
of
virginity
now
that
we
have
some
idea
of
the
situation
of
the
reproductive
organs
and
their
relations
to
one
another
we
shall
be
ready
to
consider
in
greater
detail
the
ovule
or
egg
in
the
ovary
ii
beginning
with
puberty
the
eggs
from
the
ovary
are
expelled
as
they
ripen
or
mature
this
process
is
called
ovulation
and
occurs
about
every
days
it
is
closely
related
to
menstruation
but
it
is
not
menstruation
as
you
will
soon
learn
some
writers
say
the
egg
is
expelled
at
other
times
than
at
the
menstrual
periods
another
writer
asserts
that
one
passes
every
six
hours
alternating
male
and
female
there
are
many
views
and
ideas
on
the
subject
of
ovulation
but
i
will
tell
you
of
the
most
generally
accepted
theory
that
the
egg
is
expelled
from
the
ovary
every
days
when
the
egg
ripens
the
ovary
discharges
it
and
sends
it
on
to
find
its
way
through
the
tubes
to
the
uterus
here
we
find
the
blood
supply
of
the
uterus
greatly
increased
in
preparation
for
the
egg
we
find
the
inner
lining
of
the
uterus
becomes
very
soft
and
smooth
so
that
the
egg
can
very
easily
find
a
place
in
which
to
lodge
itself
after
it
has
been
fertilized
we
also
find
that
the
cells
swell
and
multiply
all
in
preparation
to
welcome
and
nourish
the
incoming
egg
or
ovum
if
the
egg
is
fertilized
by
the
male
it
then
remains
in
the
uterus
to
develop
if
not
it
is
thrown
out
together
with
all
the
preparation
made
to
receive
it
the
cells
burst
and
discharge
their
contents
the
mucus
blood
cells
and
all
come
away
in
what
is
called
the
menstrual
flow
at
one
time
woman
was
thought
to
be
the
only
creature
which
menstruated
but
science
now
tells
us
that
all
warm
blooded
animals
which
walk
erect
menstruate
the
discharge
is
chiefly
due
to
the
position
which
in
standing
upright
throws
the
large
part
of
the
uterus
higher
than
the
neck
in
animals
such
as
dogs
cats
the
same
process
goes
on
but
the
position
of
these
animals
keeps
the
large
part
of
the
uterus
lower
than
the
small
part
where
the
blood
is
retained
and
then
reabsorbed
into
the
system
this
process
goes
on
every
four
weeks
in
girls
after
they
reach
the
age
of
puberty
and
continues
at
regular
periods
as
long
as
the
egg
is
not
fertilized
until
the
reproductive
age
is
over
which
is
usually
between
the
and
fiftieth
year
if
however
the
egg
is
fertilized
the
menstrual
flow
ceases
and
this
blood
supply
goes
to
nourish
the
new
life
in
the
uterus
it
does
not
appear
again
until
after
the
birth
of
the
child
and
usually
ceases
while
the
child
depends
upon
the
milk
from
the
mammal
glands
the
age
at
which
this
process
menstruation
first
takes
place
in
girls
differs
in
individuals
climate
has
some
effect
upon
it
for
girls
in
warm
or
southern
climates
mature
earlier
than
in
colder
places
in
this
climate
the
average
girl
reaches
puberty
at
fourteen
years
of
age
some
have
been
known
to
reach
it
as
early
as
the
eleventh
and
others
not
until
the
eighteenth
year
all
in
the
same
place
and
yet
normal
and
healthy
which
shows
there
is
no
reason
for
anxiety
if
the
girl
does
not
menstruate
at
fourteen
provided
she
is
developing
normally
and
is
in
good
health
during
the
first
few
years
after
its
appearances
the
periods
are
likely
to
be
irregular
this
is
because
the
sexual
organs
are
not
fully
developed
often
the
period
does
not
occur
after
the
first
time
for
three
five
eight
months
and
sometimes
a
year
this
irregularity
continues
for
two
or
three
years
cases
of
girls
coming
from
europe
have
been
known
where
the
period
was
perfectly
established
over
there
but
after
arriving
in
this
climate
the
menstrual
flow
did
not
occur
again
for
a
year
and
over
usually
this
irregularity
lasts
only
a
few
months
and
when
once
it
has
become
regular
there
should
be
no
worry
over
its
arrival
a
day
or
two
earlier
or
later
the
length
of
time
the
period
lasts
differs
in
women
also
the
average
length
of
time
is
four
or
five
days
yet
there
are
women
in
which
it
lasts
fully
a
week
and
others
but
a
few
hours
the
length
of
time
should
not
be
of
as
much
concern
as
the
amount
of
discharge
which
is
expelled
each
time
it
is
of
course
difficult
to
estimate
this
but
physicians
claim
that
more
than
three
protectives
in
hours
should
not
be
used
in
all
women
the
flow
is
most
profuse
during
the
first
two
days
the
care
of
the
health
should
receive
more
attention
during
the
first
two
days
than
is
usually
given
it
to
the
girl
who
has
to
work
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
these
two
days
are
unusually
hard
on
her
nerves
and
on
her
general
health
and
i
regret
that
i
have
no
new
message
for
her
to
help
lighten
the
burden
which
under
the
present
atrocious
industrial
system
makes
it
so
hard
for
her
physicians
say
there
should
be
no
need
of
interrupting
the
regular
routine
of
the
day
at
this
time
more
than
any
other
there
are
a
few
strong
women
to
whom
this
period
makes
no
difference
but
the
average
girl
in
this
country
spends
two
days
of
pain
and
discomfort
out
of
girls
questioned
only
per
cent
were
entirely
free
from
pain
which
proves
that
the
time
has
come
for
women
to
cease
being
ashamed
of
this
function
and
insisting
upon
at
least
one
day
rest
at
the
expense
of
her
employer
some
of
the
old
biblical
ideas
instilling
into
the
man
mind
that
a
woman
is
unclean
at
this
time
has
been
the
cause
of
much
hardship
and
many
sneers
endured
by
a
woman
during
these
periods
the
consequence
has
been
that
she
will
bear
the
most
intense
pain
rather
than
allow
the
men
working
with
her
to
suspect
that
she
is
menstruating
it
is
all
nonsense
and
wrong
and
it
is
time
women
should
band
together
in
one
great
sisterhood
to
protect
one
another
from
being
slowly
drained
and
exhausted
of
their
powers
of
motherhood
for
the
benefit
of
their
exploiters
women
who
belong
to
unions
should
demand
that
this
day
be
given
them
and
their
sisters
girls
continue
to
suffer
pains
in
the
abdomen
and
back
pains
running
down
the
limbs
headache
often
nausea
besides
being
nervous
and
irritable
yet
hang
on
a
strap
in
an
overcrowded
street
car
stand
or
sit
all
day
in
the
shop
or
at
the
machine
and
utter
no
protest
they
know
too
they
are
not
alone
in
this
suffering
for
they
see
about
them
day
after
day
hundreds
of
other
women
enduring
the
same
pain
yet
they
remain
silent
how
long
will
you
endure
this
working
women
there
is
one
thing
to
remember
that
the
greatest
strain
comes
on
the
nervous
system
at
this
period
one
of
the
best
ways
to
assist
in
building
up
the
nerve
strength
is
in
sleep
and
rest
and
for
the
girl
who
dares
not
remain
away
from
the
shop
fearing
to
lose
her
job
the
next
best
thing
is
to
get
to
bed
early
for
there
nothing
that
builds
up
the
exhausted
nerves
like
sleep
fortunately
the
girl
at
school
has
some
consideration
shown
her
at
this
time
and
it
is
well
that
this
is
so
for
until
the
period
becomes
established
there
is
special
danger
of
overdoing
in
school
work
which
often
causes
vitus
dance
and
other
nervous
disorders
i
believe
in
the
regular
warm
tub
bath
or
cold
sponge
followed
by
a
good
rubbing
all
over
the
body
at
this
time
together
with
nine
or
ten
hours
sleep
and
light
nourishing
food
without
stimulant
if
the
bowels
are
active
it
often
lessens
the
pain
considerably
and
it
is
very
important
that
every
girl
attend
to
this
if
she
has
any
regard
for
her
health
there
are
a
few
abnormalities
of
the
menstrual
function
which
i
will
not
take
the
space
to
state
here
before
leaving
the
subject
i
wish
to
impress
upon
the
reader
that
most
abnormalities
such
as
too
little
or
too
much
flow
or
very
great
exhausting
pain
are
usually
caused
not
by
any
disease
of
the
generative
organs
but
more
often
a
disturbance
of
the
general
health
which
can
often
be
treated
and
cured
by
building
up
the
system
every
girl
should
learn
the
laws
of
menstruation
and
its
hygiene
and
have
a
full
understanding
of
the
same
the
menstrual
function
occurs
only
in
the
female
at
puberty
but
at
the
same
time
there
comes
to
both
boys
and
girls
or
male
and
female
a
mysterious
and
impelling
influence
which
has
great
power
over
the
lives
of
both
during
the
adolescent
period
unless
they
understand
and
control
it
this
is
known
as
the
sexual
impulse
chapter
iv
sexual
i
the
sexual
impulse
is
the
strongest
force
in
all
living
creatures
it
is
this
that
animates
the
struggle
for
existence
it
is
this
that
attracts
and
unites
two
beings
that
they
may
reproduce
their
kind
it
is
this
that
inspires
man
to
the
highest
and
noblest
thoughts
it
is
this
also
that
inspires
man
to
all
endeavors
and
achievements
to
all
art
and
poetry
this
impulse
is
the
creative
instinct
which
dominates
all
living
things
and
without
which
life
must
die
if
then
this
force
this
impulse
plays
so
strong
a
part
in
our
lives
is
it
not
necessary
that
we
know
something
about
it
at
the
time
of
puberty
there
comes
both
to
boys
and
girls
two
the
desire
to
touch
or
caress
to
come
in
contact
with
to
write
or
to
speak
to
an
individual
of
the
opposite
sex
this
impulse
is
much
stronger
in
girls
than
in
boys
the
other
is
the
impulse
that
impels
the
individual
to
discharge
the
accumulation
of
ripe
sex
cells
and
relieve
himself
of
the
nervous
tension
which
this
accumulation
produces
this
impulse
is
stronger
in
boys
than
in
girls
one
writer
states
that
this
is
an
unconscious
desire
for
relief
from
physical
congestion
not
differing
greatly
from
the
sense
of
relief
which
the
emptying
of
the
bladder
or
rectum
produces
these
two
impulses
together
according
to
moll
constitute
the
sexual
impulse
and
this
constitutes
the
foundation
upon
which
love
the
greatest
of
all
emotions
is
based
at
the
time
of
puberty
we
learned
from
the
last
article
that
the
first
manifestations
of
sexual
maturity
in
the
girl
is
the
appearance
of
the
menstrual
flow
but
also
at
puberty
there
comes
the
sexual
impulse
which
evidences
itself
during
sleep
in
a
filmy
substance
dropping
from
the
mouth
of
the
uterus
this
detumescence
does
not
appear
very
often
in
young
girls
but
later
in
life
when
sex
instinct
becomes
stronger
it
occurs
during
sleep
especially
in
young
widows
having
experienced
sexual
relations
they
are
however
seldom
aware
of
its
taking
place
consequently
it
has
not
the
danger
which
it
presents
to
the
boy
in
the
preceding
article
on
puberty
we
discussed
only
the
girl
at
puberty
but
here
it
is
necessary
to
understand
that
during
puberty
many
changes
take
place
in
the
boy
such
as
change
of
voice
the
growth
of
hair
on
the
face
various
parts
of
the
body
and
most
important
the
discharge
of
the
sexual
fluid
commonly
known
as
seminal
emissions
this
latter
symptom
appears
in
every
normal
healthy
boy
on
reaching
the
age
of
puberty
but
unlike
the
menstrual
period
which
occurs
at
a
stated
period
in
girls
the
seminal
emissions
do
not
depend
upon
a
special
period
they
occur
at
different
times
often
twice
a
month
unlike
menstruation
which
in
the
girl
lasts
from
two
to
seven
days
the
discharge
lasts
only
a
few
seconds
and
is
not
accompanied
by
pain
this
expulsion
is
considered
perfectly
normal
and
is
not
a
sign
of
physical
or
sexual
weakness
but
a
sign
that
a
surplus
accumulation
of
ripe
sex
cells
are
present
and
have
come
to
their
full
development
and
overflow
nature
takes
care
of
this
and
uses
all
of
this
fluid
according
to
the
needs
of
the
individual
casting
off
the
surplus
it
is
this
symptom
that
alarms
young
boys
at
puberty
it
is
this
overflow
which
enables
quack
doctors
to
play
upon
the
innocent
and
ignorant
boy
telling
him
that
it
is
an
indication
of
weakness
and
it
is
also
the
result
of
telling
older
boys
about
leads
boys
to
houses
of
prostitution
for
they
are
told
by
their
ignorant
advisers
that
they
must
have
sexual
relations
or
endanger
their
sexual
capacity
it
is
also
this
overflow
which
occurring
in
sleep
awakens
the
boy
and
he
is
conscious
of
what
has
occurred
he
is
conscious
also
of
a
pleasurable
sensation
which
this
sense
of
relief
produces
and
unless
warned
against
it
he
will
try
at
some
later
time
to
bring
on
this
relief
by
friction
or
mechanical
means
which
is
known
as
called
the
age
of
puberty
is
one
of
the
periods
in
an
individual
life
in
which
it
is
easiest
to
acquire
this
habit
in
girls
as
well
as
in
boys
although
the
girl
may
not
be
conscious
of
any
sensation
through
the
accumulation
of
the
detumescence
yet
there
is
the
same
nervous
tension
that
exists
in
boys
due
to
congestion
of
the
now
fully
developed
genital
organs
perhaps
slighter
in
intensity
but
it
is
there
and
the
girl
becomes
conscious
of
it
in
talking
to
older
girls
about
sex
menstruation
she
is
often
led
into
the
habit
of
masturbation
cases
have
been
known
where
children
formed
this
habit
in
infancy
almost
through
the
ignorance
of
nurses
or
even
mothers
who
not
aware
of
the
consequences
have
kept
babies
from
crying
by
gently
patting
or
rubbing
the
sexual
parts
it
may
be
caused
also
by
uncleanliness
itching
tight
clothing
etc
when
the
habit
is
formed
in
very
small
children
it
can
be
exercised
in
the
very
presence
of
the
parents
but
they
being
ignorant
of
the
habit
itself
or
the
consequences
interpret
the
actions
as
baby
ways
again
the
habit
is
formed
upon
entering
school
it
is
said
no
school
is
free
from
it
and
it
is
a
fact
that
no
institution
today
is
free
from
pupils
who
practice
masturbation
in
public
schools
are
found
groups
of
perverted
boys
and
girls
whose
depraved
ideas
sooner
or
later
permeate
the
place
a
recent
issue
of
a
conservative
woman
journal
says
in
absolute
filth
of
conversation
nothing
could
equal
the
talk
of
boys
and
girls
during
recess
in
our
schools
what
is
still
worse
is
that
the
child
is
generally
instructed
in
masturbation
prostitution
and
sometimes
sexual
this
subject
of
masturbation
is
at
present
under
discussion
from
many
points
of
view
among
the
medical
profession
some
claiming
that
as
with
venereal
diseases
we
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
matter
and
exaggerate
the
harm
done
to
the
individual
by
it
one
writer
plainly
states
that
it
is
of
such
common
practice
that
out
of
a
hundred
young
men
and
women
are
addicted
to
it
and
the
hundredth
one
is
lying
another
says
that
out
of
a
hundred
men
and
women
arriving
at
the
age
of
have
practiced
it
at
some
time
by
these
examples
such
writers
would
try
to
prove
that
because
people
out
of
one
hundred
are
not
in
insane
asylums
the
practice
can
not
be
as
harmful
as
it
is
stated
by
others
to
be
let
us
take
a
sane
and
logical
view
of
this
subject
in
children
before
they
have
reached
the
age
of
puberty
prior
to
the
development
of
the
sexual
organs
it
stands
to
reason
that
to
abuse
these
organs
before
they
are
strong
enough
to
be
exercised
must
weaken
them
for
their
natural
functions
again
masturbation
unlike
the
sexual
act
can
be
practiced
individually
and
at
all
times
and
nearly
anywhere
this
gives
the
individual
unlimited
opportunity
for
indulgence
and
consequently
drains
and
exhausts
the
system
of
the
vitality
necessary
for
full
development
in
the
boy
or
girl
past
puberty
we
find
one
of
the
most
dangerous
forms
of
masturbation
mental
masturbation
which
consists
of
forming
mental
pictures
or
thinking
of
obscene
or
voluptuous
pictures
this
form
is
considered
especially
harmful
to
the
brain
for
the
habit
becomes
so
fixed
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
free
the
thoughts
from
lustful
pictures
every
girl
should
guard
against
the
man
who
invariably
turns
a
word
or
sentence
into
a
lustful
or
commonly
termed
smutty
channel
for
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
is
a
mental
masturbator
perhaps
the
greatest
physical
danger
to
the
chronic
masturbator
is
the
inability
to
perform
the
sexual
act
naturally
the
strong
physical
irritants
which
are
used
are
likely
to
produce
catarrhal
disease
of
these
organs
in
both
sexes
producing
such
irritating
sensations
that
relief
is
demanded
and
this
can
be
obtained
only
by
repeating
the
habit
and
so
it
continues
the
individual
promises
himself
over
and
over
again
after
such
exercises
to
overcome
the
habit
but
his
will
power
gradually
becomes
destroyed
and
the
impulse
continues
he
knows
and
intuitively
feels
such
practice
degrades
him
and
destroys
his
character
he
feels
he
is
losing
control
of
himself
and
also
realizes
that
his
health
especially
his
nervous
system
is
being
undermined
in
my
personal
experience
as
a
trained
nurse
while
attending
persons
afflicted
with
various
and
often
revolting
diseases
no
matter
what
their
ailments
i
never
found
any
one
so
repulsive
as
the
chronic
masturbator
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
fill
page
upon
page
of
confessions
made
by
young
girls
whose
lives
were
blighted
by
this
pernicious
habit
always
begun
so
innocently
for
even
after
they
have
ceased
the
habit
they
find
themselves
incapable
of
any
relief
in
the
natural
act
this
causes
a
nervous
and
excited
condition
in
the
girl
tossing
about
nervously
for
hours
after
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
a
girl
to
overcome
the
habit
than
a
man
the
effects
are
more
permanent
in
her
before
closing
this
subject
however
i
want
to
tell
of
a
case
of
an
eight
year
old
boy
i
attended
during
an
attack
of
measles
i
found
he
was
shy
and
unresponsive
and
at
times
very
nervous
and
irritable
with
a
strong
liking
to
be
alone
i
observed
him
closely
for
a
few
days
and
reported
the
results
of
my
observation
to
the
attending
physician
he
was
convinced
of
the
truth
that
the
little
fellow
was
masturbating
the
physician
assigned
me
to
the
task
of
talking
to
the
child
who
acknowledged
that
he
was
touching
himself
and
had
been
ever
since
he
could
remember
the
little
fellow
mother
had
died
when
he
was
in
infancy
leaving
beside
himself
a
brother
a
year
older
with
whom
he
slept
i
explained
to
him
the
danger
as
well
as
i
could
and
the
result
was
that
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
whisperings
and
found
the
little
fellow
asking
the
older
brother
to
tie
his
hands
to
the
bedpost
this
the
older
brother
did
with
a
handkerchief
and
the
child
went
to
sleep
in
this
way
every
night
during
the
few
weeks
i
was
attending
him
the
first
few
nights
he
was
awake
practically
all
of
the
time
struggling
to
overcome
this
habit
which
he
finally
overcame
completely
at
puberty
every
boy
and
girl
should
be
taught
these
dangers
and
temptations
and
also
how
to
avoid
them
by
keeping
active
mentally
and
physically
going
to
bed
only
when
sleepy
avoiding
intoxicating
drinks
and
stimulants
we
have
strayed
some
distance
i
know
from
the
beginning
of
our
treat
of
its
perversion
masturbation
but
we
shall
now
take
up
the
normal
natural
impulse
and
see
what
there
is
that
every
girl
should
know
sexual
ii
in
the
first
part
of
this
article
we
learned
that
the
sexual
impulse
is
a
combination
of
the
two
impulses
the
one
which
impels
the
discharge
of
ripe
sex
cells
strongest
in
the
boy
and
the
other
which
impels
the
individual
to
touch
or
caress
an
individual
of
the
opposite
sex
strongest
in
the
girl
every
girl
has
in
mind
an
ideal
man
this
ideal
begins
to
form
sometime
in
the
early
adolescent
age
he
is
usually
distinct
in
her
mind
as
to
his
physical
qualities
such
as
dark
or
light
hair
or
brown
or
blue
eyes
he
is
always
a
certain
physical
type
and
often
remains
an
ideal
to
her
through
life
at
the
forming
period
of
the
type
she
will
be
attracted
toward
many
men
who
seem
to
answer
the
ideal
type
but
as
she
reads
and
develops
through
the
various
stages
of
the
adolescent
period
the
ideal
changes
and
grows
with
her
as
she
reaches
the
romantic
stage
the
ideal
must
be
brave
daring
courteous
if
she
is
inclined
toward
outdoor
sports
he
must
be
athletic
and
so
it
goes
on
until
the
year
when
the
average
girl
has
a
fairly
settled
idea
of
the
man
who
would
suit
her
as
a
mate
through
life
when
the
sexual
impulse
makes
itself
felt
strongly
in
the
adolescent
boy
or
girl
they
feeling
satisfied
with
the
physical
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
other
marry
they
are
unconscious
that
the
incentive
to
love
when
based
on
physical
attraction
alone
is
soon
destroyed
for
sickness
poverty
or
disease
will
affect
even
the
most
seemingly
perfect
physical
attraction
let
us
not
confuse
the
sexual
impulse
with
love
for
it
alone
is
not
love
but
merely
a
necessary
quality
for
the
growth
of
love
no
sexual
attraction
or
impulse
is
the
foundation
of
the
beautiful
emotion
of
love
upon
this
is
built
respect
sympathy
unity
of
purpose
many
common
tastes
and
desires
building
up
and
up
until
this
real
love
unites
two
individuals
as
one
being
one
life
then
it
becomes
the
strongest
and
purest
emotion
of
which
the
human
soul
is
capable
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
natural
aim
of
the
sexual
impulse
is
the
sexual
act
yet
when
the
impulse
is
strongest
and
followed
by
the
sexual
act
without
love
or
any
of
the
relative
instincts
which
go
to
make
up
love
the
relations
are
invariably
followed
by
a
feeling
of
disgust
respect
for
each
other
and
for
one
self
is
a
primary
essential
to
this
intimate
relation
in
plant
and
animal
life
the
reproductive
cell
of
the
male
is
the
active
seeker
of
the
passive
female
cell
imbued
with
the
instinct
to
chase
and
bodily
capture
the
female
cell
for
the
purpose
of
reproduction
this
instinct
man
as
he
is
today
has
inherited
and
as
with
the
lower
forms
of
life
the
senses
are
intensely
involved
it
is
kept
alive
by
the
sense
of
sight
sound
and
smell
and
reaches
its
highest
development
through
the
sense
of
touch
it
is
heightened
by
touching
smooth
and
soft
is
said
to
account
for
the
pleasure
of
kissing
in
the
early
part
of
this
article
i
spoke
of
the
desire
to
touch
being
stronger
in
girls
than
in
boys
this
desire
leads
a
girl
to
kiss
and
fondle
a
man
without
any
conscious
desire
for
the
sexual
act
whereas
in
the
man
to
be
touched
and
caressed
by
the
girl
for
whom
he
has
a
sexual
attraction
stimulates
the
accumulation
of
sex
cells
and
the
desire
for
the
sexual
act
becomes
paramount
in
his
mind
many
a
young
girl
bubbling
over
with
the
joy
of
living
innocent
of
any
serious
consequences
is
misjudged
by
men
on
account
of
these
natural
actions
but
she
soon
puts
on
her
armor
of
defense
and
stifles
and
represses
any
outbursts
of
affection
society
too
condemns
the
natural
expression
of
woman
emotion
save
under
certain
prescribed
conditions
in
consequence
of
this
women
suppress
their
natural
desires
and
direct
this
great
force
into
other
channels
participating
in
the
bigger
and
broader
movements
and
activities
in
which
they
are
active
today
this
is
one
reason
why
the
type
of
the
old
maid
so
characteristic
of
the
generation
past
has
disappeared
these
great
maternal
powers
are
being
used
up
in
the
activities
of
modern
life
instead
of
allowing
it
to
remain
dormant
and
make
her
odd
and
whimsical
the
modern
woman
turns
her
sexual
impulse
into
a
big
directing
force
that
the
male
creature
is
the
pursuer
of
the
female
in
all
forms
of
life
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
female
has
the
choice
of
selection
and
uses
fine
discrimination
in
her
choice
can
not
be
denied
either
this
instinct
of
selection
seems
to
lie
dormant
in
women
of
today
for
at
puberty
nature
calls
to
every
girl
to
make
a
selection
suitable
to
her
nature
yet
few
girls
follow
this
instinct
on
account
of
the
specter
of
economic
insecurity
which
looms
up
before
them
instead
of
asking
themselves
are
we
mateable
and
sympathetic
they
ask
shall
we
have
enough
food
clothing
and
shelter
indeed
girls
this
system
increases
our
degradation
and
places
us
in
ideals
lower
than
the
animals
all
over
the
civilized
world
today
girls
are
being
given
and
taken
in
marriage
with
but
one
purpose
in
view
to
be
by
the
man
who
takes
her
she
does
not
concern
herself
with
the
man
physical
condition
his
hereditary
taints
the
cleanliness
of
his
mind
or
past
life
nor
with
the
future
of
the
race
there
will
no
doubt
be
a
great
change
in
woman
attitude
on
this
subject
in
the
next
few
years
when
women
gain
their
economic
freedom
they
will
cease
being
playthings
and
utilities
for
men
but
will
assert
themselves
and
choose
the
father
of
their
offspring
as
bernard
shaw
tells
of
her
in
one
of
his
greatest
plays
she
will
hunt
down
her
ideal
in
order
to
produce
the
superman
there
seems
to
be
a
general
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
woman
who
is
demanding
political
freedom
to
demand
sexual
freedom
also
when
a
girl
reaches
the
age
nearing
thirty
her
natural
development
tends
toward
sexual
freedom
it
seems
as
though
nature
knowing
the
time
of
reproduction
is
drawing
to
a
close
calls
with
all
the
fury
of
her
strength
to
complete
its
development
and
procreate
it
is
at
this
age
where
physicians
claim
a
woman
awakens
to
the
sexual
desire
and
it
is
at
this
age
that
women
seek
affection
or
gratification
with
a
to
her
there
is
nothing
to
say
she
is
mature
developed
and
can
judge
for
herself
where
best
her
happiness
lies
but
to
the
young
girl
at
the
age
of
say
twenty
or
even
younger
immature
mentally
undeveloped
there
is
something
she
should
know
and
that
is
that
every
physical
impulse
every
sensual
feeling
every
lustful
desire
will
come
to
her
whitewashed
with
the
sacred
word
love
neither
the
boy
nor
the
girl
knows
the
difference
between
the
sexual
impulse
and
love
a
boy
meets
a
girl
he
feels
a
great
attraction
for
her
he
feels
the
sexual
impulse
throbbing
within
him
he
is
full
of
this
current
he
feels
it
throughout
his
being
he
walks
lighter
and
straighter
he
feels
it
in
his
voice
in
his
laughter
he
grows
tenderer
within
himself
and
to
women
he
feels
all
this
and
is
sure
it
is
a
love
that
will
never
die
if
there
is
an
attraction
on
the
girl
part
there
is
no
difficulty
in
persuading
her
that
this
feeling
is
love
but
it
is
not
love
it
is
the
creative
force
or
sexual
impulse
scattered
through
his
being
and
the
sexual
act
brings
it
to
a
focus
if
motherhood
comes
to
the
girl
through
this
relation
she
has
developed
and
the
experience
has
enriched
her
life
but
today
the
girl
has
an
idea
she
has
escaped
the
greatest
disgrace
when
she
has
avoided
motherhood
if
the
relation
was
based
on
physical
attraction
alone
a
few
abortions
and
the
monotony
of
every
day
life
soon
remove
this
and
the
man
goes
elsewhere
in
search
of
this
wonderful
sensation
which
he
felt
at
first
but
did
not
know
how
to
keep
or
how
to
use
the
girl
however
has
become
a
new
being
sexually
awakened
and
conscious
of
it
but
ignorant
of
the
use
of
the
forces
she
possesses
she
plunges
forth
blindly
with
social
and
economic
forces
against
her
and
prostitution
beckoning
at
every
turn
so
she
soon
passes
with
the
crowd
on
the
road
to
the
easiest
way
this
is
the
story
of
thousands
of
young
girls
living
in
prostitution
women
should
know
that
the
creative
instinct
does
not
need
to
be
expended
entirely
on
the
propagation
of
the
race
though
the
sex
cells
are
placed
in
a
part
of
the
anatomy
for
the
essential
purpose
of
easily
expelling
them
into
the
female
for
the
purpose
of
reproduction
there
are
other
elements
in
the
sexual
fluid
which
are
the
essence
of
blood
nerve
brain
and
muscle
when
redirected
into
the
building
and
strengthening
of
these
we
find
men
or
women
of
the
greatest
endurance
and
greatest
magnetic
power
a
girl
can
waste
her
creative
powers
by
brooding
over
a
love
affair
to
the
extent
of
exhausting
her
system
with
results
not
unlike
the
effects
of
masturbation
and
debauchery
the
sexual
impulse
is
natural
it
is
natural
in
animals
degenerates
and
in
man
but
in
man
it
is
mixed
with
other
essentials
which
together
are
termed
love
these
essentials
are
derived
from
man
power
of
reasoning
by
which
he
is
known
as
a
higher
species
and
through
which
he
differs
from
the
animals
when
man
emerged
from
the
jungle
and
stood
upright
on
his
hind
legs
the
shape
of
his
head
and
his
face
changed
from
the
long
jaw
and
flat
head
of
the
animal
to
the
flat
face
and
high
head
of
the
man
all
progress
from
that
time
forward
was
made
along
mental
lines
according
to
universal
law
then
in
existence
he
should
have
been
limited
to
a
geographical
area
and
killed
by
the
extreme
heat
or
cold
or
starved
for
one
kind
of
food
if
it
were
not
obtained
but
against
all
these
he
fought
because
he
became
endowed
with
such
attributes
as
reason
knowledge
and
instead
of
using
his
creative
powers
solely
in
hunting
food
and
reproducing
his
species
he
used
this
force
in
making
plans

for
man
has
developed
a
conscious
mind
which
asserts
itself
by
reasoning
which
in
turn
has
developed
his
brain
power
it
is
said
a
fish
as
large
as
a
man
has
a
brain
no
larger
than
the
kernel
of
an
almond
in
all
fish
and
reptiles
where
there
is
no
great
brain
development
there
is
also
no
conscious
sexual
control
the
lower
down
in
the
scale
of
human
development
we
go
the
less
sexual
control
we
find
it
is
said
the
aboriginal
australian
the
lowest
known
species
of
the
human
family
just
a
step
higher
than
the
chimpanzee
in
brain
development
has
so
little
sexual
control
that
police
authority
alone
prevents
him
from
obtaining
sexual
satisfaction
on
the
streets
according
to
one
writer
the
rapist
has
just
enough
brain
development
to
raise
him
above
the
animal
but
like
the
animal
when
in
heat
knows
no
law
except
nature
which
impels
him
to
procreate
whatever
the
result
every
normal
man
and
woman
has
the
power
to
control
and
direct
his
sexual
impulse
men
and
women
who
have
it
in
control
and
constantly
use
their
brain
cells
thinking
deeply
are
never
sensual
it
is
well
to
understand
that
the
natural
aim
of
the
sexual
impulse
is
the
sexual
act
and
the
natural
aim
of
the
sexual
act
is
reproduction
though
it
does
not
always
result
in
this
it
is
possible
for
conception
to
take
place
without
love
it
is
even
possible
that
there
is
no
conscious
knowledge
to
procreate
before
or
during
the
act
yet
this
does
not
disprove
the
fact
that
nature
has
designed
it
for
the
purpose
of
reproduction
no
matter
what
uses
man
has
put
it
to
today
this
subject
of
procreation
we
shall
discuss
next
every
girl
should
know
that
to
hold
in
check
the
sexual
impulse
to
absorb
this
power
into
the
system
until
there
is
a
freely
conscious
sympathy
a
confidence
and
respect
between
her
and
her
ideal
that
this
will
go
toward
building
up
the
sexual
impulse
and
will
make
the
purest
strongest
and
most
sacred
passion
of
adult
life
compared
to
which
all
other
passions
pale
into
insignificance
chapter
i
in
teaching
children
or
young
persons
the
process
of
reproduction
one
of
the
cleanest
most
natural
and
beautiful
methods
of
doing
this
is
to
tell
them
the
process
which
goes
on
in
the
various
forms
of
life
in
the
flower
fish
frog
bird
and
to
lead
up
to
the
highest
and
most
complex
of
all
living
they
watch
the
butterfly
and
bee
carry
a
load
of
pollen
from
the
father
buttercup
to
fertilize
the
seeds
within
the
mother
flower
they
watch
and
frog
awaken
from
their
long
winter
nap
and
stirred
by
the
impulse
within
them
start
for
the
breeding
pond
they
watch
father
thrush
win
his
mate
and
patiently
stand
guard
over
her
during
the
tedious
hatching
days
they
are
told
and
see
that
the
flowers
depend
upon
outside
forces
to
bring
the
pollen
from
the
male
to
the
female
to
fertilize
the
seeds
before
the
seeds
could
grow
they
are
taught
that
the
mother
fish
lay
her
eggs
in
the
water
first
and
that
the
father
fish
unlike
the
flowers
being
able
to
move
about
carries
the
pollen
which
is
now
a
fluid
to
the
seeds
himself
they
are
told
that
father
frog
being
a
higher
creature
fertilized
the
eggs
before
they
reached
the
water
and
father
thrush
being
still
higher
in
the
scale
fertilized
the
eggs
before
they
left
the
mother
body
that
the
higher
the
species
was
the
greater
the
care
required
to
preserve
that
species
in
this
way
the
mind
is
prepared
for
the
information
which
should
follow
the
girl
at
puberty
should
be
taught
this
process
and
something
of
what
goes
on
within
the
womb
after
the
ovum
has
been
fertilized
she
should
know
that
all
organic
life
is
the
result
of
a
simple
cell
that
man
is
a
community
of
cells
banded
together
and
depending
upon
each
cell
to
carry
on
its
work
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
let
us
first
then
get
an
idea
of
a
cell
and
what
it
is
and
what
it
does
a
cell
is
a
tiny
portion
of
living
matter
having
in
its
center
a
spot
or
nucleus
which
represents
the
point
of
germination
it
is
separated
from
its
sister
cells
by
partitions
of
cell
membrane
a
simple
cell
is
formed
by
the
fusion
of
two
germ
cells
when
they
meet
to
exchange
nuclear
elements
after
this
fusion
they
are
able
to
proceed
with
fission
which
means
splitting
into
parts
and
it
is
the
subsequent
cellular
growth
of
the
fused
that
constitutes
reproduction
there
are
two
kinds
of
reproductive
cells
the
ova
in
the
female
and
the
spermatozoa
in
the
male
when
the
sexual
act
takes
place
there
is
deposited
into
the
vagina
a
secretion
known
as
semen
according
to
sutkowsky
each
deposit
or
ejaculation
contains
of
spermatozoa
about
the
same
time
in
the
act
there
occurs
in
the
female
spasmodic
contractions
of
the
muscles
of
the
uterus
which
draws
in
a
small
amount
of
the
sperm
which
the
male
has
left
there
the
sperm
cell
of
the
male
under
the
microscope
shows
that
it
contains
both
head
and
tail
the
tail
enables
it
to
move
and
advance
with
a
motion
toward
the
ovum
as
in
the
lower
forms
of
life
the
male
cell
has
within
it
the
instinct
to
chase
and
capture
the
female
cell
consequently
it
does
not
depend
upon
the
uterine
contractions
of
the
female
to
enable
it
to
reach
the
ovum
for
fertilization
the
vagina
being
a
corrugated
or
wrinkled
tube
hides
and
secretes
the
sperm
cell
for
days
unless
it
is
removed
with
water
or
killed
by
poisonous
injections
when
however
the
sperm
comes
near
the
ovum
it
is
drawn
to
it
as
to
a
magnet
the
ovum
being
carefully
protected
by
nature
within
the
ovaries
leaves
its
sister
cells
and
travels
alone
the
sperm
cell
however
having
more
dangerous
paths
to
travel
must
provide
against
the
uncertainty
of
doing
its
great
work
by
going
in
numbers
though
it
takes
but
one
single
cell
to
produce
human
life
a
number
of
the
male
cells
go
to
meet
the
ovum
but
only
one
enters
it
almost
at
the
moment
the
head
enters
the
ovum
it
becomes
completely
absorbed
by
the
ovum
and
all
trace
of
it
is
lost
this
union
of
the
two
cells
is
called
fertilization
fecundation
impregnation
or
conception
any
of
these
terms
may
be
used
this
union
usually
takes
place
in
the
tube
but
the
fertilized
egg
does
not
remain
there
it
wanders
along
and
finds
its
way
into
the
uterus
now
that
the
ovum
has
been
fertilized
it
readily
becomes
attached
to
the
soft
lining
of
the
uterus
which
has
been
specially
prepared
to
receive
it
no
menstruation
occurs
the
woman
is
now
pregnant
a
new
being
is
created
and
marvelous
changes
will
now
take
place
within
the
tiny
cell
clinging
so
weakly
to
the
lining
of
the
uterus
at
this
time
the
ovum
is
so
small
it
can
scarcely
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
but
in
two
weeks
it
has
grown
to
the
size
of
a
pea
in
four
weeks
to
the
size
of
a
walnut
and
in
eight
weeks
to
the
size
of
a
lemon
at
this
time
it
is
three
inches
long
and
is
completely
formed
the
head
being
much
larger
in
proportion
to
the
rest
of
its
body
what
has
happened
to
the
ovum
in
these
few
weeks
is
briefly
this
all
the
changes
in
the
evolution
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
man
had
to
pass
through
to
arrive
at
his
present
shape
the
human
embryo
goes
through
step
by
step
within
the
uterus
in
a
very
short
period
immediately
after
fertilization
the
ovum
begins
to
divide
into
sections
or
lobes
into
etc
cells
until
they
are
almost
countless
each
cell
splits
in
the
middle
of
the
nucleus
forming
two
complete
new
cells
and
so
on
the
next
stage
is
represented
by
this
mass
of
cells
forming
themselves
into
a
shape
like
a
hollow
ball
the
third
stage
is
the
meeting
of
the
two
layers
of
cells
as
if
the
ball
had
collapsed
and
these
two
layers
meet
and
unite
as
one
stretch
and
flatten
out
like
a
worm
after
this
stage
things
become
more
complicated
new
organs
begin
to
develop
line
marks
for
the
backbone
and
intestinal
canal
show
themselves
as
do
the
bony
and
muscular
structure
of
the
skeleton
a
slight
pulsation
is
observed
showing
the
development
of
the
heart
the
head
fold
is
formed
by
a
gradual
bending
of
the
spinal
column
at
the
front
end
of
the
ovum
which
we
will
now
call
the
embryo
there
are
also
formed
at
this
time
processes
which
soon
become
arms
and
legs
there
is
a
furrow
on
the
face
pits
for
the
eyes
all
of
which
has
happened
in
less
than
four
weeks
from
this
time
forward
development
is
rapid
the
bones
which
up
to
this
time
have
been
soft
matter
grow
harder
and
all
organs
which
were
only
outlined
illustration
fig
ii
foetus
in
the
uterus
at
two
months
now
become
definitely
formed
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
it
has
grown
to
its
natural
shape
the
remaining
months
it
increases
in
size
and
gains
strength
the
uterus
becomes
enlarged
rises
out
of
the
pelvis
and
occupies
the
abdominal
cavity
it
takes
forty
weeks
or
days
to
complete
the
growth
of
the
human
embryo
although
the
time
may
be
two
weeks
more
or
less
and
yet
be
normal
let
us
see
how
the
child
has
been
fed
all
this
time
when
the
ovum
is
fertilized
and
up
to
the
eighth
week
it
is
fed
by
delicate
branched
threads
which
form
a
covering
for
it
these
threads
are
called
villi
and
dip
into
the
uterine
surface
for
nourishment
from
the
mother
to
supply
the
embryo
about
the
eighth
week
these
villi
have
grown
greatly
intertwined
into
a
mass
of
spongy
tissue
full
of
blood
vessels
called
the
placenta
afterbirth
this
fastens
itself
to
one
side
of
the
uterus
takes
oxygen
as
well
as
nutriment
from
the
mother
and
sends
it
through
the
umbilical
cord
to
the
child
the
point
of
attachment
being
at
the
navel
the
depression
left
on
the
belly
of
the
child
by
the
cutting
of
the
umbilical
cord
at
birth
in
the
same
way
it
takes
the
waste
product
from
the
child
to
the
mother
and
she
in
turn
throws
them
out
of
her
system
through
the
kidneys
bowels
and
skin
the
child
and
placenta
are
both
encased
within
a
membraneous
sac
which
secretes
and
serves
to
hold
a
watery
fluid
in
which
the
child
swims
the
child
is
folded
together
with
legs
on
the
thighs
and
thighs
on
the
belly
arms
on
the
chest
and
head
bent
forward
over
the
breast
toward
the
end
of
the
term
it
moves
about
slightly
often
stretches
a
little
and
has
periods
of
rest
when
it
scarcely
moves
and
again
periods
of
great
activity
a
mother
first
feels
the
child
move
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
month
often
the
young
mother
at
this
time
begins
to
worry
over
her
acts
lest
something
she
should
do
might
deform
the
precious
charge
she
carries
this
as
you
can
readily
understand
from
its
early
development
is
impossible
for
by
the
end
of
the
second
month
the
child
has
been
formed
and
no
mental
impressions
of
the
mother
can
alter
its
shape
just
as
the
nucleus
of
the
male
sperm
has
within
it
all
the
contributions
which
the
father
of
the
child
can
give
it
until
after
it
is
born
so
does
the
mother
give
it
its
physical
qualities
right
at
the
beginning
whatever
is
to
be
inherited
from
the
father
must
be
within
the
substance
of
the
spermatozoon
at
the
time
the
ovum
is
fertilized
he
has
no
further
influence
over
it
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
children
of
great
men
are
seldom
above
the
average
in
intelligence
where
on
the
other
hand
almost
all
men
of
great
minds
have
had
intelligent
mothers
how
great
or
how
little
influence
a
mother
has
over
her
child
through
her
thoughts
has
not
been
proven
nor
has
the
subject
of
determining
or
influencing
sex
of
the
unborn
child
been
settled
at
the
end
of
nine
months
the
child
development
is
complete
and
it
is
ready
for
its
journey
to
the
outside
world
the
process
of
this
journey
is
called
labor
word
which
will
describe
the
mother
share
in
it
when
this
occurs
before
the
embryo
is
able
to
live
outside
the
uterus
it
is
known
as
abortion
ii
in
the
first
part
of
this
essay
i
said
that
if
the
process
of
labor
occurs
before
the
seventh
month
which
is
the
earliest
time
the
foetus
can
live
for
any
length
of
time
outside
the
womb
it
is
known
as
abortion
or
miscarriage
when
labor
occurs
later
than
this
or
within
two
weeks
before
term
it
is
known
as
premature
labor
the
average
girl
in
using
the
word
abortion
has
in
mind
a
criminal
act
whereby
the
process
of
pregnancy
is
purposely
interrupted
she
prefers
the
word
miscarriage
there
is
also
a
belief
among
girls
that
a
miscarriage
occurring
in
the
early
stages
of
pregnancy
can
be
brought
about
without
bad
results
or
any
serious
consequences
to
her
health
it
is
a
mistake
to
regard
an
abortion
as
of
slight
importance
for
any
interruption
in
the
process
of
pregnancy
is
always
more
dangerous
than
the
natural
labor
at
full
term
one
writer
claims
there
are
more
women
ill
in
consequence
of
abortion
than
from
full
term
childbirth
on
account
of
which
there
are
so
many
women
who
are
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
often
excessive
loss
of
blood
leaves
the
woman
in
a
weak
and
rundown
condition
thereby
lessening
her
powers
of
resistance
to
other
diseases
the
shock
to
the
woman
system
is
greater
than
that
produced
by
natural
labor
and
consequently
leaves
her
in
a
hysterical
and
often
critically
nervous
state
for
some
time
after
the
causes
of
abortion
are
many
among
them
are
overexertion
overexcitement
shock
fright
fall
great
anger
dancing
fatigue
lifting
heavy
weights
purgative
medicines
and
excessive
sexual
intercourse
the
dangers
resulting
from
abortion
are
blood
poison
lockjaw
has
been
known
to
be
the
result
of
abortion
also
the
danger
that
one
miscarriage
is
likely
to
follow
another
and
disables
a
woman
to
carry
a
child
to
the
full
term
if
there
is
the
same
care
and
treatment
given
the
woman
who
aborts
as
the
woman
in
childbirth
she
will
naturally
be
less
likely
to
suffer
serious
results
than
if
no
medical
attention
were
given
her
one
of
the
most
common
disturbances
of
pregnancy
is
nausea
more
commonly
called
morning
sickness
because
it
is
felt
in
the
morning
when
the
woman
first
assumes
the
erect
position
as
a
rule
this
lasts
only
during
the
early
months
about
the
latter
part
of
the
fourth
month
or
often
not
before
the
fifth
month
movements
of
the
foetus
are
felt
these
movements
are
called
life
and
women
are
glad
of
this
signal
that
all
is
progressing
naturally
one
writer
said
a
woman
had
described
the
first
feeling
of
life
as
the
trembling
movements
of
a
bird
within
the
there
are
often
many
nervous
manifestations
accompanying
the
pregnant
woman
such
as
headache
neuralgia
toothache
and
as
a
usual
thing
constipation
is
always
present
and
should
receive
attention
the
teeth
also
should
receive
attention
at
this
time
for
they
decay
easily
on
account
of
the
secretions
in
the
mouth
which
are
increased
during
pregnancy
the
breasts
enlarge
in
the
early
months
of
pregnancy
and
there
is
a
fullness
and
tingling
felt
often
in
the
fifth
week
the
nipples
become
erect
and
the
skin
around
the
nipple
becomes
dark
brown
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
disturbances
of
pregnancy
but
enough
to
show
that
other
organs
beside
the
uterus
are
tested
in
strength
and
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
good
healthy
body
in
fact
every
tissue
and
fiber
in
the
woman
body
feels
the
impetus
of
pregnancy
and
all
kinds
of
physical
changes
occur
like
in
june
every
clod
feels
a
stir
of
might
an
instinct
within
it
that
reaches
and
one
of
the
common
questions
asked
by
young
women
in
early
married
life
is
how
to
tell
if
they
are
pregnant
this
is
not
always
easy
but
there
are
a
few
points
on
which
a
diagnosis
is
based
namely
in
a
healthy
woman
during
the
reproductive
age
the
function
of
menstruation
stops
together
with
the
morning
sickness
and
the
enlargement
of
the
breasts
with
dark
color
around
the
nipples
these
are
early
indications
that
pregnancy
exists
i
am
not
going
to
take
the
time
nor
space
to
explain
that
all
three
of
the
above
named
can
exist
in
nervous
women
even
when
pregnancy
does
not
exist
it
is
as
i
said
before
with
the
average
healthy
girl
i
am
dealing
not
with
the
exception
the
only
certain
signs
of
pregnancy
are
the
hearing
of
the
of
the
child
and
its
movements
another
question
which
troubles
a
young
woman
is
how
to
count
the
time
when
she
will
be
confined
this
too
is
difficult
to
say
for
an
error
of
two
weeks
earlier
or
later
is
possible
because
the
time
of
conception
is
seldom
definitely
known
experience
has
given
a
method
of
arriving
at
an
approximate
date
which
is
used
and
which
answers
the
purpose
fairly
well
though
it
is
by
no
means
perfect
add
seven
days
to
the
first
day
of
the
last
menstruation
and
count
nine
months
forward
for
example
menstruated
last
beginning
october
add
seven
days
this
brings
the
date
to
october
add
nine
months
which
brings
the
date
of
confinement
to
july
it
is
well
to
have
everything
prepared
two
weeks
before
this
date
so
that
the
woman
can
be
as
much
as
possible
in
the
open
air
during
the
remaining
waiting
days
the
dress
of
the
pregnant
woman
should
receive
serious
attention
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
simple
and
warm
without
bands
restricting
the
circulation
of
any
part
of
the
body
like
skirt
bands
round
garters
corsets
and
tight
shoes
the
secret
of
a
comfortable
outfit
for
the
expectant
mother
is
to
have
all
clothing
hang
from
the
shoulders
combination
underwear
can
be
bought
as
reasonably
as
the
separate
drawers
and
shirt
there
should
be
no
pressure
on
the
womb
from
above
rather
let
all
support
come
from
below
the
corset
gets
in
its
harmful
work
by
pressing
down
the
uterus
into
the
pelvis
thus
displacing
the
abdominal
organs
and
crowding
them
together
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
injury
to
the
uterus
as
well
as
to
the
child
itself
the
muscles
of
the
uterus
and
abdomen
are
weakened
and
from
this
results
that
horror
of
all
women
the
high
some
women
especially
those
having
borne
children
prefer
to
wear
in
the
latter
days
of
pregnancy
an
abdominal
supporter
if
it
is
well
fitted
to
the
body
it
helps
to
assist
the
abdominal
muscles
in
carrying
the
weight
and
affords
great
relief
if
women
would
devote
to
making
themselves
comfortable
during
pregnancy
as
much
time
as
they
give
on
the
baby
outfit
they
would
profit
by
it
instead
of
wearing
any
old
dress
and
out
of
style
make
one
maternity
dress
to
fit
the
figure
this
can
of
course
be
let
out
in
size
as
the
figure
grows
it
can
be
made
of
some
pretty
inexpensive
material
and
gives
such
comfort
and
ease
to
the
mind
as
well
as
to
the
body
that
the
woman
who
has
once
had
one
will
never
again
do
without
it
the
food
also
should
be
simple
in
fact
there
are
few
restrictions
to
be
placed
on
food
unless
so
ordered
by
the
physician
one
common
mistake
of
women
is
that
they
believe
they
are
eating
for
two
persons
and
consequently
must
gorge
themselves
which
of
course
results
in
indigestion
physicians
advise
a
small
amount
of
meat
once
a
day
plenty
of
water
milk
and
cereals
fruit
vegetables
and
especially
fruit
which
loosens
the
bowels
rich
pastry
or
starches
fried
in
fat
should
not
be
eaten
because
they
are
hard
to
digest
there
is
no
reason
why
the
diet
should
be
at
all
strict
unless
a
woman
is
under
the
special
care
of
a
physician
she
should
take
a
moderate
amount
of
exercise
every
day
but
should
not
get
tired
walking
in
the
open
air
in
the
sunlight
is
best
avoid
dancing
swimming
and
all
violent
exercise
sewing
on
the
sewing
machine
should
be
restricted
fainting
in
the
early
months
is
often
caused
from
bad
air
in
overcrowded
and
overheated
rooms
also
from
an
empty
stomach
when
the
woman
is
too
busy
to
notice
nature
call
for
nourishment
it
is
now
generally
agreed
that
alcohol
taken
by
the
mother
during
pregnancy
has
very
bad
effects
on
the
offspring
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
here
except
that
a
pregnant
woman
should
be
mentally
and
physically
active
though
not
fatigued
and
of
all
things
she
should
keep
out
of
the
hearing
of
old
superstitions
which
have
a
sign
for
every
act
and
keep
a
young
woman
constantly
worried
she
should
not
be
allowed
to
worry
over
her
approaching
labor
and
as
far
as
possible
be
kept
cheerful
and
happy
another
question
which
concerns
every
expectant
mother
is
if
there
is
any
danger
in
sexual
intercourse
during
pregnancy
at
the
end
of
the
period
the
child
and
the
placenta
are
expelled
from
the
uterus
the
uterus
gradually
returns
to
its
former
size
it
requires
about
six
weeks
for
this
to
occur
and
it
is
very
important
that
there
should
be
no
heavy
lifting
and
overwork
at
this
time
as
a
rule
after
childbirth
the
woman
form
becomes
matured
and
more
developed
the
facial
expression
takes
on
a
kinder
a
maternal
look
the
whole
nervous
system
is
awakened
to
sympathy
pain
or
grief
bringing
tears
to
the
eyes
quicker
than
ever
before
especially
is
this
true
for
the
first
few
years
following
the
important
thing
is
that
the
care
of
the
pregnant
woman
should
be
begun
in
girlhood
if
we
are
going
to
be
and
have
mothers
then
we
should
give
attention
to
the
development
of
the
organs
which
make
us
mothers
chapter
vi
some
consequences
of
ignorance
and
i
when
the
boy
arrives
at
the
age
of
puberty
he
is
in
greater
danger
than
a
girl
of
being
not
only
led
astray
by
companions
but
being
actually
sent
into
unclean
living
by
those
nearest
and
most
interested
in
his
parents
the
reason
of
this
is
that
there
has
been
and
still
is
a
false
idea
clinging
to
many
parents
that
as
soon
as
the
boy
has
seminal
emissions
it
is
a
signal
that
he
must
have
sexual
relations
or
suffer
in
health
that
the
seminal
emissions
are
not
harmful
and
that
they
grow
less
frequent
as
the
boy
grows
older
is
a
fact
of
which
few
mothers
seem
to
be
aware
we
can
not
blame
the
mothers
of
the
past
for
not
informing
their
sons
of
this
physical
condition
for
few
of
them
knew
it
themselves
mothers
have
been
as
ignorant
as
the
boys
of
their
sex
functions
as
well
as
other
functions
of
the
body
they
accepted
sickness
disease
and
even
death
without
a
question
placing
their
faith
and
confidence
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
medical
profession
who
like
the
rabbis
and
high
priests
made
a
church
of
their
knowledge
fortunately
this
condition
of
affairs
is
changing
and
the
knowledge
of
the
human
body
which
for
ages
has
been
most
carefully
locked
within
the
medical
libraries
is
fast
taking
up
its
abode
in
the
homes
of
the
it
belongs
it
is
said
that
in
japan
or
china
the
duty
of
a
physician
is
to
keep
his
patients
in
good
health
receiving
payment
only
when
they
are
well
certainly
this
sounds
like
civilization
only
a
few
weeks
ago
i
had
occasion
to
talk
to
a
woman
about
her
oldest
son
whom
i
considered
sick
from
overwork
and
lack
of
nourishment
she
informed
me
however
that
this
was
not
so
and
whispered
confidently
that
he
was
years
old
and
in
that
age
when
he
needs
a
she
further
remarked
that
she
and
the
papa
had
talked
it
over
with
the
result
that
the
father
had
told
the
boy
when
he
had
the
desire
for
a
woman
that
he
the
father
would
give
him
money
enough
to
get
think
of
that
boy
attitude
toward
women
and
the
danger
to
become
affected
with
venereal
diseases
that
he
was
likely
to
contract
yet
both
parents
had
the
sincerest
wish
to
do
their
best
for
that
boy
they
gave
the
best
advice
they
knew
one
of
the
most
common
errors
i
have
found
among
people
even
those
educated
in
other
lines
of
thought
is
that
the
sexual
organs
will
become
useless
unless
they
are
used
in
early
manhood
this
is
considered
untrue
by
the
best
authorities
on
the
subject
for
it
is
known
that
the
essential
organs
of
reproduction
are
glands
not
unlike
the
tear
glands
of
the
eyes
or
the
milk
glands
of
the
breasts
the
tear
glands
do
not
atrophy
even
if
one
does
not
cry
for
years
nor
the
milk
glands
during
the
entire
period
of
reproduction
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
sexual
glands
another
idea
which
is
fast
being
uprooted
is
that
the
sexual
act
is
an
appetite
not
unlike
that
of
hunger
and
thirst
which
must
be
fed
by
the
boy
sowing
his
wild
oats
first
before
settling
down
to
marriage
it
is
now
a
recognized
fact
that
it
is
no
more
necessary
for
a
boy
to
sow
wild
oats
than
it
is
for
a
girl
and
women
are
today
demanding
of
men
the
same
cleanliness
of
body
and
mind
which
men
have
heretofore
considered
necessary
only
in
women
it
is
now
the
unreserved
opinion
of
the
foremost
medical
men
of
the
day
that
a
man
does
not
suffer
in
health
from
living
a
continent
life
nor
is
he
a
mollycoddle
from
so
doing
hutchinson
says
the
belief
that
the
exercise
of
the
sex
functions
is
necessary
to
the
health
of
the
male
at
any
age
is
a
pure
delusion
while
before
full
maturity
it
is
highly
ruggles
says
sexual
abstinence
is
compatible
with
perfect
health
and
tends
to
increase
virility
which
means
manhood
through
the
reabsorption
of
the
the
ancient
teutons
were
aware
of
this
for
it
is
said
that
it
was
considered
a
most
shameful
thing
for
their
young
men
to
have
sexual
relations
with
a
woman
before
their
year
from
observation
and
experience
they
were
convinced
that
men
were
not
sexually
mature
much
before
this
age
and
no
one
will
dispute
they
were
strong
and
manly
statistics
show
that
per
cent
of
men
infected
with
venereal
diseases
which
means
diseases
due
to
sexual
intercourse
are
contracted
between
the
ages
of
and
years
and
per
cent
are
contracted
in
the
and
years
writers
claim
that
from
statistics
they
have
found
men
are
not
sexually
mature
before
the
year
and
women
not
before
the
twentieth
year
yet
we
find
them
both
reeking
with
sexual
diseases
before
this
age
according
to
sanger
history
of
prostitution
it
is
claimed
that
of
the
prostitutes
enter
the
life
before
the
twentieth
year
in
new
york
city
it
is
safe
to
say
this
is
a
conservative
estimate
for
the
more
recent
investigations
in
chicago
and
other
cities
show
a
very
much
higher
percentage
however
this
together
with
the
statistics
of
venereal
diseases
mentioned
above
show
that
it
is
before
the
boy
and
girl
are
sexually
mature
that
there
is
the
greatest
difficulty
in
directing
the
impulses
and
controlling
the
passions
chassaignac
says
that
the
more
healthy
and
normal
an
individual
is
the
better
can
he
not
only
control
his
passions
but
the
less
likely
is
he
to
be
disturbed
by
continence
just
one
more
word
on
the
subject
of
continence
and
that
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
find
men
determined
to
remain
continent
until
they
find
their
ideal
woman
nor
for
athletes
in
training
engaged
in
contests
nor
for
sailors
on
long
sea
voyages
and
many
others
for
long
periods
of
time
is
continence
impossible
in
fact
they
are
better
for
it
this
knowledge
was
not
lost
sight
of
in
ancient
times
reference
is
made
to
it
in
the
bible
in
the
sending
of
women
prostitutes
into
the
camps
of
the
enemy
the
night
before
an
expected
battle
in
order
to
exhaust
or
decrease
the
vitality
of
the
soldiers
when
one
finds
an
individual
who
realizes
the
force
of
the
sexual
impulses
and
knows
how
to
conserve
them
you
usually
find
a
person
who
does
not
drain
or
exhaust
these
forces
but
uses
them
in
creative
work
every
girl
should
look
upon
the
man
who
indulges
freely
in
the
sexual
relations
social
as
a
prostitute
far
more
degraded
than
the
unfortunate
girl
who
is
compelled
to
sell
her
body
to
sustain
life
every
girl
should
know
something
about
the
physical
makeup
of
a
boy
as
well
as
of
her
own
for
upon
the
of
both
does
the
future
race
depend
to
be
a
real
mother
a
woman
must
understand
a
boy
emotions
and
development
if
she
would
sympathize
with
him
and
when
she
does
understand
she
will
not
send
him
to
buy
a
woman
for
physical
satisfaction
it
is
this
ignorance
of
parents
together
with
the
silence
of
the
medical
profession
which
is
largely
responsible
for
the
terrible
spread
of
venereal
diseases
which
exist
today
when
a
few
years
ago
morrow
stated
that
there
is
more
venereal
diseases
among
innocent
virtuous
wives
than
among
prostitutes
this
statement
should
have
resounded
throughout
the
walls
of
every
home
in
the
land
instead
of
which
it
is
kept
intact
within
the
covers
of
large
volumes
where
only
those
wearing
cap
and
gown
have
access
to
it
it
is
claimed
that
out
of
married
men
in
new
york
have
gonorrhoea
and
per
cent
of
these
have
not
been
cured
and
can
infect
their
wives
the
result
is
that
at
least
three
out
of
every
five
married
women
in
new
york
have
gonorrhoea
this
seems
astounding
and
exaggerated
but
the
following
quotation
is
taken
from
an
authority
and
is
considered
quite
conservative
over
per
cent
of
our
young
men
stray
from
the
path
of
virtue
before
marriage
per
cent
contract
venereal
diseases
which
are
difficult
to
cure
more
wives
than
prostitutes
have
venereal
diseases
of
all
diseases
in
new
york
hospitals
are
venereal
infected
persons
walk
the
streets
it
seems
to
me
that
the
above
facts
are
sufficient
to
warrant
every
girl
and
boy
knowing
something
about
these
diseases
some
consequences
of
ignorance
and
ii
the
two
venereal
diseases
which
i
will
tell
you
something
of
here
are
those
most
commonly
known
to
and
syphilis
gonorrhoea
is
an
inflammation
of
the
urethra
water
passage
characterized
by
redness
swelling
smarting
pain
on
the
passing
of
water
and
accompanied
by
thick
purulent
poisonous
discharge
at
first
creamy
in
color
and
later
a
greenish
yellow
it
is
considered
by
the
highest
authorities
as
solely
a
sexual
disease
in
adults
depending
almost
exclusively
upon
sexual
intercourse
as
its
mode
of
origin
and
infection
in
children
however
it
is
not
the
rule
especially
in
infants
and
little
girls
who
can
be
infected
by
the
hands
of
the
mother
or
nurse
being
soiled
with
the
discharge
also
where
the
fresh
discharge
is
on
towels
toilets
etc
it
starts
an
inflammation
of
the
outer
delicate
parts
but
seldom
enters
the
urethra
in
former
days
gonorrhoea
was
considered
an
ordinary
catarrhal
inflammation
no
worse
than
a
bad
cold
the
old
saying
went
it
was
thought
to
originate
in
women
with
the
discharge
at
the
end
of
the
menstrual
period
or
leucorrhoea
in
fact
any
secretions
from
the
uterus
of
an
irritating
character
were
thought
to
be
sources
of
gonorrhoea
however
with
the
discovery
of
the
microbe
gonococcus
in
by
neisser
it
is
now
an
established
fact
that
the
disease
comes
from
a
source
where
there
is
either
latent
or
chronic
gonorrhoea
which
of
course
means
that
the
gonococcus
is
present
it
is
considered
a
conservative
estimate
that
at
least
per
cent
of
the
adult
population
in
this
country
have
suffered
from
gonococcal
infection
more
men
than
women
have
been
and
are
infected
the
first
symptoms
of
the
disease
appear
from
three
to
seven
days
after
infection
and
under
proper
treatment
the
discharge
may
disappear
in
six
or
eight
weeks
if
the
man
or
woman
places
himself
under
the
care
of
a
specialist
within
hours
after
infection
the
disease
is
often
of
much
shorter
duration
when
allowed
to
become
chronic
it
is
called
gleet
too
much
emphasis
can
not
be
put
upon
the
danger
of
placing
any
one
with
this
disease
into
the
hands
of
the
doctors
who
advertise
so
conspicuously
claiming
rapid
and
complete
cures
for
all
sexual
diseases
experience
has
found
that
thousands
of
boys
and
young
men
attracted
by
such
alluring
promises
as
only
the
quack
can
put
forth
have
been
under
such
treatment
only
to
find
later
that
the
disease
was
allowed
to
remain
in
the
tissues
the
discharge
only
having
been
dried
up
the
germs
were
allowed
to
continue
their
work
on
up
into
the
bladder
kidneys
joints
heart
and
even
to
the
brain
the
germs
can
live
for
years
in
the
body
hidden
away
in
the
gland
ducts
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
organ
first
attacked
being
in
a
normal
state
yet
when
a
condition
arises
when
the
vitality
of
the
tissues
in
which
the
germs
are
lodged
is
lowered
or
which
gives
the
germs
themselves
more
nourishment
or
stimulus
such
as
alcohol
or
excessive
intercourse
they
almost
always
become
active
again
in
women
the
small
part
of
the
womb
cervix
as
well
as
the
urethra
are
favorite
places
of
attack
when
the
disease
attacks
the
cervix
a
woman
may
not
be
conscious
of
it
and
so
unless
prominent
symptoms
attend
it
she
may
infect
many
persons
in
the
meantime
in
man
on
the
other
hand
the
disease
can
not
be
present
without
his
knowing
there
is
something
wrong
and
it
should
be
impressed
upon
him
that
it
is
a
moral
obligation
on
his
part
not
to
have
sexual
relations
until
he
has
been
examined
and
pronounced
cured
by
a
specialist
in
diseases
your
general
practitioner
will
always
recommend
to
you
a
specialist
if
you
ask
him
to
when
the
disease
attacks
the
uterus
and
ovaries
it
very
often
blocks
the
fallopian
tubes
and
prevents
the
impregnation
of
the
ovum
it
is
said
that
over
of
the
childless
marriages
are
due
to
gonorrhoea
in
women
innocently
contracted
from
their
husbands
both
men
and
women
can
become
sterile
from
this
disease
the
seminal
tubes
in
the
man
become
blocked
thus
disabling
him
from
impregnating
the
ovum
again
when
the
disease
attacks
the
organs
of
generation
unless
speedily
attended
to
the
organs
get
into
a
chronic
state
of
inflammation
the
disease
is
therefore
more
difficult
to
reach
the
chances
of
cure
more
difficult
and
it
usually
means
an
operation
for
the
woman
the
great
mass
of
ailing
women
who
trace
their
misery
back
to
never
seeing
a
well
day
since
marriage
can
be
classed
among
those
suffering
with
this
disease
as
can
also
that
army
of
women
whose
illness
is
classed
among
female
a
curious
point
to
know
is
that
a
man
may
have
a
hidden
or
latent
gonorrhoea
of
which
he
is
not
aware
for
it
gives
him
no
trouble
and
may
infect
a
clean
healthy
woman
during
sexual
relations
and
she
in
turn
can
infect
him
with
the
same
disease
acting
like
a
fresh
infection
giving
rise
to
pain
and
discomfort
the
great
majority
of
infections
in
women
are
contracted
from
men
who
believe
themselves
cured
being
under
the
false
impression
that
they
are
cured
because
the
discharge
has
ceased
at
a
lecture
given
by
a
physician
in
this
city
last
winter
the
physician
advised
every
girl
whose
sweetheart
lover
or
expected
husband
had
a
history
of
inflammatory
rheumatism
of
the
joints
back
of
him
that
as
she
values
her
life
and
future
health
not
to
marry
that
man
without
a
thorough
examination
by
a
specialist
in
these
diseases
he
declared
young
man
should
have
inflammatory
this
statement
is
considered
somewhat
exaggerated
by
some
making
more
recent
investigations
yet
all
seem
to
agree
that
a
very
large
majority
of
cases
of
inflammatory
rheumatism
of
the
joints
have
the
gonococcus
present
if
the
woman
is
not
made
sterile
by
the
disease
and
is
able
to
carry
the
child
to
full
term
labor
then
there
is
another
danger
of
infecting
the
child
eyes
during
the
process
of
labor
when
the
secretions
lodge
themselves
into
the
delicate
membrane
of
the
eyes
then
unless
quick
action
is
applied
the
sight
of
both
eyes
can
be
lost
over
per
cent
of
blindness
in
babies
is
due
to
this
germ
it
can
be
carried
into
the
eyes
of
both
children
and
adults
by
any
means
which
can
carry
the
discharge
to
the
eyes
upon
the
slightest
suspicion
that
this
has
been
done
medical
aid
should
be
summoned
at
once
there
is
one
fortunate
thing
to
know
that
the
germ
can
not
live
for
a
great
length
of
time
outside
its
natural
or
proper
environment
though
it
can
for
years
be
hidden
in
the
body
it
dries
up
very
quickly
and
special
solutions
of
both
bichloride
and
permanganate
of
potash
will
kill
the
germs
with
which
the
solution
comes
in
contact
there
is
but
one
course
to
follow
that
upon
any
of
the
symptoms
mentioned
above
go
at
once
to
a
reliable
physician
and
follow
his
instructions
closely
and
remember
that
the
causes
which
retard
recovery
are
alcoholic
drinks
lack
of
rest
spicy
food
and
it
is
said
there
is
no
positive
proof
against
this
disease
except
continency
until
marriage
and
then
monogamy
a
story
is
told
of
a
young
irish
physician
who
being
asked
how
he
treated
gonorrhoea
replied
most
tersely
with
that
this
was
for
a
time
a
general
feeling
is
agreed
but
with
the
knowledge
that
so
many
persons
especially
women
contract
the
disease
under
the
moral
as
well
as
legal
conditions
of
present
society
the
feeling
has
changed
a
woman
is
infected
by
her
husband
after
the
marriage
is
sanctioned
by
the
state
and
blessed
by
the
church
neither
taking
the
interest
in
the
woman
future
to
guarantee
to
her
a
clean
individual
as
a
husband
prostitution
has
been
upheld
and
women
segregated
for
sexual
use
the
government
going
to
the
extent
of
authorizing
examinations
of
the
women
for
venereal
diseases
to
insure
safety
from
these
diseases
yet
there
has
been
no
such
protection
given
either
the
woman
prostitute
or
the
wife
that
the
man
body
is
free
from
them
on
the
other
hand
every
means
to
keep
a
married
woman
in
ignorance
of
the
source
of
her
infection
is
made
by
the
church
state
and
society
in
general
every
law
to
protect
the
man
crime
is
made
for
his
use
while
women
remain
unprotected
victims
of
his
guilt
and
this
they
say
is
to
protect
the
family
and
the
james
wood
tells
a
story
of
his
experience
with
a
young
woman
of
married
five
years
when
she
came
to
him
the
husband
admitted
having
had
gonorrhoea
previous
to
marriage
the
doctor
found
her
flowing
excessively
the
cervix
badly
torn
the
uterus
sharply
bent
back
and
fixed
ovaries
bound
down
and
adherent
the
tubes
thickened
a
leuchorreal
discharge
was
present
which
contained
gonococci
and
other
symptoms
which
made
her
sick
and
miserable
the
doctor
operated
upon
her
scraping
her
womb
sewing
the
torn
cervix
opening
the
abdomen
to
remove
the
thickened
appendix
and
inflamed
ovaries
and
tubes
she
convalesced
beautifully
and
had
no
bad
or
unusual
symptoms
for
six
months
at
which
time
she
returned
with
a
renewed
infection
careful
questioning
extracted
from
the
husband
the
confession
that
he
had
been
out
with
the
boys
and
had
had
a
recurrence
of
gonorrhoea
most
of
the
good
which
came
from
the
operation
was
spoiled
by
this
second
infection
this
is
only
one
simple
example
of
what
is
meant
by
preserving
the
home
and
family
at
the
terrible
cost
of
women
lives
women
should
protest
against
the
medical
secret
which
decrees
that
they
be
kept
in
ignorance
where
their
health
as
well
as
life
is
directly
concerned
that
there
are
men
in
the
medical
profession
in
this
country
as
well
as
in
europe
who
have
openly
protested
against
respecting
the
secret
where
another
life
is
involved
seems
a
cheerful
signal
of
a
general
social
awakening
in
this
field
in
the
medical
record
april
maude
glasgow
says
after
suffering
for
years
a
woman
becomes
a
feeble
nervous
woman
her
life
is
a
burden
the
operating
table
is
her
only
hope
and
she
leaves
it
deformed
mutilated
and
if
women
voluntarily
exposed
themselves
to
diseases
which
would
sap
the
husband
vitality
making
him
a
dependent
invalid
or
expose
him
to
the
shock
of
a
mutilating
operation
or
men
continue
to
suffer
would
they
allow
the
medical
secret
to
protect
women
in
this
alleged
freedom
every
girl
knows
he
would
neither
protect
her
nor
continue
to
suffer
it
is
women
only
who
have
allowed
the
double
standard
of
morals
to
stand
so
long
giving
men
the
purest
and
best
of
their
womanhood
but
not
demanding
the
same
from
them
as
soon
as
women
realize
the
danger
to
themselves
and
their
children
which
they
are
likely
to
incur
from
men
who
have
lived
promiscuously
they
will
revolt
against
such
standards
gonorrhoea
differs
from
syphilis
and
though
it
is
not
a
disease
which
can
be
transmitted
from
the
parent
to
children
as
syphilis
can
yet
it
is
a
subtle
wrecking
disease
and
can
do
almost
as
much
harm
to
the
individual
what
every
girl
should
know
illustration
nothing
by
order
of
the
post
office
department
from
new
york
call
after
temporary
suppression
of
article
what
every

should
know
by
the
postal
authorities
the
particular
part
of
the
article
objected
to
by
the
postal
authorities
some
consequences
of
ignorance
and
iii
prominent
medical
authorities
claim
that
syphilis
was
not
known
in
europe
before
the
discovery
of
america
others
equally
as
prominent
hold
that
it
has
existed
for
many
centuries
in
europe
but
was
confused
with
other
diseases
such
as
leprosy
it
makes
little
difference
to
the
girl
or
boy
today
just
how
long
or
where
it
came
from
the
point
we
do
know
is
that
it
is
here
in
our
homes
and
workshops
and
we
should
know
what
it
is
like
and
how
to
avoid
it
a
story
is
told
of
a
french
nobleman
whose
son
was
about
to
leave
his
home
to
live
in
a
big
city
said
the
father
to
the
son
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
god
fear
at
least
this
advice
might
be
applied
today
for
if
boys
or
girls
knew
or
could
see
the
appalling
results
of
syphilis
they
would
surely
fear
it
for
it
is
humanity
most
deadly
foe
syphilis
is
an
infectious
disease
caused
by
a
special
microbe
which
is
acquired
by
contagion
or
heredity
it
is
chronic
in
course
varied
and
intermittent
in
character
and
the
length
of
time
it
remains
in
the
body
is
indefinite
it
is
so
widespread
that
no
country
in
the
world
is
free
from
it
neither
is
any
organ
of
the
body
exempt
from
its
ravages
let
us
take
a
young
man
indulging
in
promiscuous
sexual
intercourse
who
cohabits
with
a
syphilitic
woman
he
notices
nothing
wrong
for
about
five
weeks
when
he
becomes
aware
of
a
pimple
on
the
sexual
organs
to
which
perhaps
he
pays
little
attention
this
grows
and
becomes
hard
at
the
base
and
is
ulcerated
on
the
top
about
ten
days
after
the
appearance
of
the
ulcer
or
chancre
the
boy
notices
that
the
glands
of
the
groins
begin
to
swell
but
as
there
is
little
or
no
pain
attached
he
still
pays
no
attention
to
all
this
after
three
or
sometimes
four
weeks
the
ulcerated
opening
heals
but
leaves
the
hard
lump
under
the
skin
in
two
or
even
three
months
after
the
time
of
infection
the
first
general
symptoms
appear
his
bones
ache
he
is
mentally
depressed
slightly
feverish
at
night
and
a
rash
appears
upon
his
body
and
sore
spots
in
the
mouth
and
throat
these
symptoms
usually
decide
him
to
consult
a
doctor
who
finds
him
in
the
second
stage
of
syphilis
this
condition
lasts
usually
about
two
and
years
the
rash
often
lasting
a
short
period
and
leaving
but
to
return
again
the
blood
within
and
the
ulcers
on
the
body
contain
the
poisons
of
the
disease
and
for
three
or
four
years
the
poison
be
by
contagion
or
by
heredity
the
third
stage
is
the
most
destructive
especially
to
the
nervous
system
for
this
disease
is
recognized
as
the
greatest
factor
in
organic
disturbances
of
the
nervous
system
it
not
rarely
is
the
cause
of
cerebral
and
spinal
meningitis
paralysis
of
the
legs
paralysis
of
one
side
of
the
body
and
that
most
helpless
and
terrible
disease
softening
of
the
brain
and
many
other
diseases
which
affect
the
spinal
cord
which
are
seldom
ever
cured
the
majority
of
those
diseased
are
left
with
physical
or
mental
infirmities
rendering
them
public
charges
there
have
been
cases
where
the
third
stage
did
not
develop
and
as
this
stage
is
not
distinctly
separated
from
the
second
stage
by
a
definite
line
it
may
not
take
place
for
months
or
even
years
after
the
first
sore
appeared
again
this
stage
has
been
averted
by
careful
treatment
in
the
early
stages
and
it
is
here
the
hope
of
all
afflicted
lies
every
case
of
syphilis
begins
with
the
characteristic
pimple
or
chancre
except
inherited
syphilis
the
chancre
always
appears
where
the
infection
enters
and
the
glands
swell
in
the
same
vicinity
for
instance
if
in
using
a
pipe
of
a
syphilitic
whose
mouth
contains
the
sore
patches
the
victim
finds
the
chancre
will
appear
on
his
lips
mouth
or
throat
and
the
glands
of
the
neck
will
swell
it
is
said
that
almost
per
cent
of
the
infections
are
contracted
innocently
especially
in
european
countries
where
kissing
and
other
forms
of
endearment
are
much
indulged
in
in
this
country
it
is
not
so
common
but
more
women
than
men
contract
it
innocently
and
in
this
manner
in
women
too
the
first
symptoms
are
not
so
characteristic
as
in
men
she
may
pay
no
attention
to
the
chancre
for
a
month
even
if
she
does
feel
aches
in
the
bones
she
thinks
she
is
run
down
or
thinks
she
has
malaria
even
the
rash
does
not
alarm
her
and
often
only
repeated
miscarriages
will
be
the
only
symptoms
she
can
remember
of
the
early
stages
she
may
continue
for
years
before
the
disease
reaches
the
third
stage
this
is
not
always
so
for
in
every
individual
the
disease
differs
in
character
and
duration
gonorrhoea
and
syphilis
differ
in
many
ways
for
instance
the
former
shows
itself
in
a
week
or
ten
days
after
infection
where
syphilis
shows
no
signs
for
five
or
six
weeks
gonorrhoea
is
considered
a
purely
sexual
disease
because
infection
takes
place
only
in
sexual
relations
except
where
the
germ
gets
into
the
eyes
while
syphilis
can
be
contracted
in
many
other
ways
through
forks
spoons
glasses
or
cups
towels
sponges
bathtubs
toilets
pipes
dental
and
barbers
instruments
and
kissing
gonorrhoea
is
considered
a
social
danger
because
of
its
effect
upon
the
sexual
organs
often
rendering
them
sterile
syphilis
is
also
a
social
danger
but
it
has
direct
effect
upon
the
offspring
and
upon
future
generations
because
its
effects
are
visited
upon
the
child
sixty
to
eighty
per
cent
of
the
syphilitic
offspring
die
at
birth
or
in
early
infancy
someone
has
well
said
the
greatest
criminal
is
he
who
poisons
the
germ
in
hereditary
syphilis
there
is
more
difficulty
in
gathering
facts
for
the
laws
which
control
it
are
not
so
well
understood
as
yet
there
is
no
sore
or
chancre
in
hereditary
syphilis
but
other
symptoms
appear
which
every
physician
recognizes
and
of
course
attends
to
at
birth
under
proper
treatment
the
danger
of
the
father
transmitting
the
disease
to
the
child
should
cease
in
from
two
to
five
years
while
the
danger
of
the
mother
transmitting
it
to
her
offspring
does
not
end
at
any
definite
time
for
there
have
been
mothers
known
to
give
birth
to
syphilitic
offspring
years
after
all
disappearance
of
their
own
symptoms
the
strongest
features
of
the
disease
transmitted
to
the
offspring
are
the
deformities
which
it
imparts
to
the
bones
of
the
head
as
well
as
of
the
body
it
is
said
on
good
authority
that
if
a
patient
at
the
end
of
five
years
has
been
two
years
without
symptoms
or
treatment
he
may
be
guaranteed
for
marriage
though
he
can
never
be
wholly
guaranteed
from
relapses
in
his
own
person
these
however
are
considered
noninfectious
the
cure
of
the
disease
depends
upon
the
individual
environment
constitution
and
his
habits
chiefly
as
regards
alcohol
and
tobacco
alcohol
is
considered
the
commonest
and
most
active
enemy
of
the
patient
recovery
men
addicted
to
the
use
of
alcohol
are
the
most
difficult
to
cure
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
if
the
disease
receives
the
proper
treatment
there
is
every
hope
for
the
individual
to
live
a
normal
life
fouriner
a
french
authority
says
personally
i
could
cite
several
hundred
observations
concerning
syphilitic
subjects
who
after
undergoing
thorough
treatment
have
married
and
became
fathers
of
healthy
the
question
then
to
receive
some
attention
is
what
means
are
available
for
the
treatment
of
both
syphilis
and
gonorrhoea
dr
prince
morrow
says
prompt
curative
treatment
is
not
only
in
the
interests
of
the
patients
themselves
but
especially
in
the
interests
of
the
others
they
might
infect
but
everywhere
we
are
confronted
with
this
situation
there
are
no
special
hospitals
for
this
class
of
diseases
few
general
hospitals
receive
them
in
the
early
curable
stage
still
fewer
have
special
venereal
wards
even
the
dispensary
services
are
not
organized
with
special
adaption
to
the
needs
of
venereal
cases
few
have
night
classes
so
that
working
people
who
go
to
the
dispensary
must
lose
half
a
day
which
often
means
the
sacrifice
of
their
employment
as
a
consequence
they
resort
to
quacks
or
the
use
of
nostrums
secret
or
quack
medicines
they
are
not
cured
but
go
on
spreading
the
seeds
of
this
is
the
condition
as
far
as
hospitals
are
concerned
in
the
matter
of
venereal
diseases
and
in
relation
to
private
practice
the
average
person
position
is
still
more
deplorable
take
for
example
the
story
of
a
girl
who
came
under
my
care
some
years
ago
after
having
suffered
three
years
with
the
disease
she
had
been
refused
attendance
in
public
hospitals
in
three
different
cities
while
she
was
working
her
way
to
new
york
at
different
times
she
consulted
physicians
only
to
learn
that
to
be
cured
she
must
be
treated
regularly
and
to
be
so
treated
would
require
money
different
estimates
were
quoted
from
to
for
treatment
as
the
amount
of
money
left
over
after
she
had
paid
her
expenses
each
week
was
never
over
the
possibility
of
a
cure
looked
hopeless
she
concluded
to
purchase
patent
medicines
whenever
she
could
but
her
condition
became
worse
until
she
was
picked
up
by
a
charitable
organization
who
cared
for
her
until
she
died
when
i
saw
her
all
her
hair
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
were
gone
her
nose
and
upper
lip
were
almost
entirely
eaten
away
most
of
her
teeth
were
fact
to
try
to
describe
her
condition
would
be
almost
impossible
this
is
only
one
case
but
there
are
thousands
of
syphilitics
who
are
wandering
around
unable
to
pay
the
prices
which
the
physician
asks
to
treat
this
disease
the
same
can
be
said
of
gonorrhoea
and
the
same
physician
who
clamors
against
the
prices
of
the
quack
forgets
that
the
price
he
asks
of
the
public
is
exorbitant
in
the
extreme
so
the
only
course
for
the
individual
to
take
if
he
can
not
pay
the
price
is
to
remain
a
menace
to
society
the
physician
assumes
no
responsibility
toward
society
to
find
out
if
the
patient
is
under
treatment
elsewhere
the
patient
can
do
as
he
pleases
with
his
disease
when
he
closes
the
doctor
door
this
then
is
the
situation
as
regards
society
attitude
toward
the
venereal
subject
society
seems
to
take
a
different
attitude
towards
other
contagious
and
infectious
diseases
such
as
measles
chicken
pox
diphtheria
etc
in
these
diseases
a
physician
has
some
responsibility
toward
society
he
must
report
each
case
as
it
comes
to
his
attention
to
the
board
of
health
who
in
turn
assume
some
responsibility
by
isolating
the
disease
if
this
is
necessary
in
these
comparatively
simple
diseases
how
much
more
important
should
it
be
to
register
and
isolate
patients
suffering
from
the
venereal
diseases
chapter
vii
menopause
or
change
of
life
in
the
previous
chapter
on
puberty
it
was
stated
that
the
menstrual
function
began
in
the
average
girl
at
fifteen
years
of
age
and
continued
until
the
or
fiftieth
year
at
this
later
age
it
ceases
together
with
her
sexual
or
capabilities
and
is
known
as
the
menopause
or
change
of
life
this
constitutes
a
period
from
the
beginning
of
irregularities
in
the
appearance
of
the
menstrual
flow
until
it
has
actually
ceased
which
period
usually
lasts
two
and
to
three
years
thousands
of
women
know
nothing
of
the
period
which
like
puberty
they
must
pass
through
but
are
entirely
ignorant
of
the
process
it
is
usual
for
them
to
look
toward
this
age
with
dread
and
foreboding
where
a
little
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
process
would
enable
them
to
enter
upon
this
period
physically
prepared
which
would
insure
their
safe
arrival
through
this
dreaded
and
period
the
greatest
change
occurring
in
the
woman
at
this
time
is
that
which
goes
on
in
the
ovaries
they
cease
to
do
their
work
and
ovulation
stops
the
first
indication
that
the
woman
has
that
this
is
likely
to
occur
is
by
the
ceasing
of
the
menses
or
monthlies
ovulation
however
very
often
continues
for
several
months
even
a
year
after
menstruation
has
entirely
ceased
the
glandular
tissues
of
the
uterus
tubes
and
ovaries
degenerate
which
is
said
to
account
for
the
menopause
and
that
of
the
ovaries
occurs
later
than
the
tubes
and
uterus
which
explains
the
continuance
of
ovulation
after
the
menses
have
stopped
in
a
few
women
the
menopause
is
accompanied
by
very
little
or
almost
no
discomfort
at
all
just
a
sudden
stopping
of
the
monthlies
announces
to
them
that
this
period
has
come
the
majority
however
do
not
pass
through
this
time
so
easily
but
suffer
for
the
entire
period
with
one
affliction
or
another
among
those
symptoms
most
common
are
flushings
or
flashes
which
are
mostly
confined
to
head
face
and
neck
are
increased
by
heat
and
motion
and
followed
by
profuse
sweating
giddiness
backache
headache
sleeplessness
disturbances
of
digestion
like
diarrhoea
or
constipation
blueness
depression
of
spirits
shortness
of
breath
palpitation
and
nervous
irritability
but
the
most
alarming
symptom
of
the
menopause
is
hemorrhage
this
is
too
often
considered
lightly
and
classed
with
the
minor
symptoms
of
this
period
whenever
there
is
excessive
bleeding
there
is
surely
a
cause
and
calls
for
special
and
immediate
attention
it
may
be
caused
by
an
inflamed
condition
of
the
lining
of
the
uterus
womb
ulceration
general
diseases
of
the
heart
lungs
and
kidneys
can
also
be
the
cause
of
excessive
bleeding
at
this
period
some
authorities
claim
that
it
also
has
its
cause
in
early
or
profuse
menstruation
too
frequent
and
difficult
labors
abortions
and
alcoholic
drinking
but
the
most
common
cause
of
hemmorhage
at
this
time
is
cancer
it
is
a
fact
that
cancer
in
women
from
the
age
of
to
is
more
common
that
at
any
other
age
perhaps
it
is
not
generally
known
that
cancer
is
now
known
to
begin
as
a
local
disease
and
if
taken
in
time
it
can
be
removed
so
completely
that
a
radical
cure
follows
no
wonder
then
that
hemmorhage
should
be
an
alarming
symptom
for
if
care
is
not
taken
and
the
dreaded
disease
cancer
is
allowed
to
take
root
the
results
are
too
generally
known
to
dwell
upon
at
the
first
signs
of
hemorrhages
or
excessive
flow
a
woman
should
place
herself
under
the
care
of
a
gynecologist
specialist
in
the
diseases
of
woman
just
as
a
pregnant
woman
is
under
the
care
of
a
physician
until
she
is
entirely
free
from
the
dangers
of
childbirth
women
have
heretofore
looked
to
this
period
with
dread
on
account
of
the
consequences
which
neglect
has
caused
it
need
not
be
dreaded
for
assuring
word
comes
from
prominent
physicians
who
have
made
this
special
period
a
study
that
the
natural
symptoms
of
the
menopause
do
not
portend
loss
of
life
reason
or
health
it
is
a
period
as
natural
to
the
woman
as
menstruation
and
with
little
care
these
symptoms
or
ailments
will
cease
in
a
few
years
leaving
the
woman
to
enjoy
years
of
good
health
when
the
period
is
delayed
beyond
the
fiftieth
year
it
calls
for
the
same
attention
as
excessive
flow
these
are
two
important
signs
of
disease
and
should
receive
immediate
care
the
period
is
however
often
brought
about
at
an
earlier
age
than
is
normal
by
mental
or
physical
shock
illness
operations
etc
the
age
at
which
it
occurs
often
differs
with
climate
race
and
according
to
kisch
social
relations
who
claims
that
the
sexual
function
is
generally
abolished
earlier
in
the
laboring
classes
who
are
compelled
to
work
hard
and
have
many
cares
and
further
states
that
a
vigorous
vitality
causes
prolongation
of
the
menstrual
process
in
the
average
woman
it
does
not
cease
at
once
but
has
two
or
three
periods
of
cessation
returns
again
for
an
irregular
period
and
continues
in
this
irregularity
for
the
entire
time
of
two
and
to
three
years
it
is
important
to
know
that
the
changes
which
are
going
on
in
the
organs
of
the
woman
are
exactly
opposite
from
those
which
occur
at
puberty
at
puberty
the
organs
are
increasing
with
life
vigor
and
vitality
while
at
the
menopause
they
are
receding
or
going
backward
the
generative
organs
gradually
but
surely
shrink
or
atrophy
after
menstruation
stops
the
uterus
becomes
small
the
vagina
whose
walls
were
formerly
corrugated
or
wrinkled
now
become
smooth
the
orifice
or
opening
of
the
vagina
becomes
shrunken
unless
it
has
been
previously
enlarged
by
the
whole
process
tends
to
show
that
the
period
is
at
an
end
which
in
fact
has
caused
much
mental
anxiety
and
disturbance
among
women
to
the
extent
of
melancholy
and
insanity
it
seems
a
very
small
things
to
give
to
every
woman
going
through
this
disagreeable
period
of
complete
change
of
climate
and
rest
until
the
change
has
become
established
certainly
she
has
served
society
to
the
best
of
her
knowledge
often
entering
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
many
times
fearlessly
to
give
the
best
of
herself
to
the
race
it
is
a
small
thing
to
give
in
return
tilt
believes
that
unmarried
women
suffer
less
at
this
period
than
married
women
and
says
as
at
puberty
from
the
ignorance
in
which
it
is
still
thought
right
to
leave
young
women
so
at
the
change
of
life
women
often
suffer
from
ignorance
of
what
may
occur
or
from
exaggerated
notions
of
the
perils
which
await
all
that
is
needed
is
to
keep
guard
on
one
the
diet
and
bowels
a
light
vegetable
diet
seems
best
at
this
time
unless
very
actively
engaged
in
physical
exercise
then
meat
once
a
day
keep
free
from
foods
difficult
to
digest
cheese
fried
foods
hot
bread
drink
plenty
of
water
and
eat
fruit
to
keep
the
bowels
open
slight
exercise
in
the
open
air
rest
sleep
and
freedom
from
mental
anxiety
are
the
simple
rules
which
are
generally
prescribed
for
women
at
this
time
tilt
says
the
best
way
to
avoid
the
danger
of
this
critical
time
is
to
meet
its
approach
with
a
healthy
and
again
says
all
complaints
remain
chronic
because
there
is
not
stamina
enough
to
carry
them
through
their
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
foremost
medical
men
that
if
women
at
the
first
sign
of
irregularities
consult
a
gynecologist
it
would
be
the
means
of
saving
thousands
of
lives
every
year
and
would
prepare
women
to
enter
upon
the
period
in
health
and
happiness
conclusion
in
conclusion
i
can
not
refrain
from
saying
that
women
must
come
to
recognize
there
is
some
function
of
womanhood
other
than
being
a
machine
too
long
have
they
allowed
themselves
to
become
this
bowing
to
the
yoke
of
motherhood
from
puberty
to
the
grave
no
other
thought
has
entered
the
mind
except
to
be
a
good
has
usually
meant
a
this
has
been
her
only
use
her
only
wish
and
when
the
age
arrives
where
she
can
not
perform
this
function
longer
she
considers
herself
useless
no
wonder
she
becomes
melancholic
or
even
insane
fortunately
the
woman
of
today
is
gradually
ridding
herself
of
such
archaic
notions
more
and
more
is
she
realizing
that
motherhood
is
only
one
of
her
capabilities
that
there
are
certain
individuals
more
fitted
for
motherhood
than
others
just
as
individuals
are
better
fitted
for
nursing
teaching
etc
and
further
must
she
realize
that
though
she
is
past
the
age
of
motherhood
yet
she
is
still
a
woman
with
all
the
instincts
and
experiences
which
motherhood
has
bestowed
upon
her
and
she
can
now
begin
a
new
development
based
upon
these
valuable
experiences
she
can
now
enter
into
public
life
unhampered
by
the
details
of
kitchen
and
babies
for
as
she
completes
her
work
and
passes
on
others
come
in
to
take
her
place
being
free
from
domestic
and
maternal
cares
enables
her
to
give
to
society
the
benefit
of
her
matured
thought
seasoned
and
enriched
by
these
experiences
she
often
does
enjoy
the
best
health
of
her
life
after
the
menopause
and
this
together
with
a
vista
of
a
future
of
usefulness
should
open
to
the
woman
in
the
period
a
new
new
world
in
completing
this
series
of
articles
i
can
not
refrain
from
uttering
just
a
word
about
the
relation
of
the
entire
subject
i
have
been
discussing
to
the
economic
problem
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
ignorance
of
parents
prostitution
venereal
diseases
or
the
silence
of
the
medical
profession
from
the
great
economic
question
that
the
world
is
facing
today
it
is
here
ever
before
us
and
the
more
we
look
into
the
evils
of
the
day
the
more
we
realize
that
the
whole
structure
of
the
present
day
society
is
built
upon
a
rotten
and
decaying
foundation
until
capitalism
is
swept
away
there
is
no
hope
for
young
girls
to
live
a
beautiful
life
during
their
girlhood
there
is
no
hope
for
boys
or
girls
to
build
up
strong
and
sturdy
bodies
there
is
no
hope
that
a
woman
can
live
in
the
family
relation
and
have
children
without
sacrificing
every
vestige
of
individual
development
there
is
no
hope
that
prostitution
will
cease
as
long
as
there
is
hunger
there
is
no
hope
for
a
strong
race
as
long
as
venereal
diseases
exist
and
they
will
exist
until
women
rise
in
one
big
sisterhood
to
fight
this
capitalist
society
which
compels
a
woman
to
serve
as
a
sex
implement
for
man
use
education
is
is
the
need
of
the
people
for
this
will
soon
enable
one
to
see
that
knowledge
alone
does
not
suffice
but
that
it
is
only
through
economic
security
that
the
man
and
the
woman
will
emerge
in
a
future
