said
the
literary
man
from
london
it
is
a
spot
where
faded
lives
are
laid
away
in
lavender
i
not
a
faded
life
and
i
not
going
to
be
laid
away
in
lavender
retorted
zora
middlemist
she
turned
from
him
and
handed
cakes
to
the
vicar
she
had
no
desire
to
pet
the
vicar
but
he
was
less
unbearable
than
the
literary
man
from
london
whom
he
had
brought
to
call
on
his
parishioners
zora
disliked
to
be
called
a
parishioner
she
disliked
many
things
in
nunsmere
her
mother
oldrieve
however
loved
nunsmere
adored
the
vicar
and
found
in
his
cleverness
the
literary
man
from
london
nunsmere
lies
hidden
among
the
oaks
of
surrey
far
from
the
busy
ways
of
men
it
is
heaven
knows
how
many
miles
from
a
highroad
you
have
to
drive
through
lanes
and
climb
right
over
a
hill
to
get
to
it
two
old
georgian
houses
covered
with
creepers
a
modern
gothic
church
two
much
more
venerable
and
inns
and
a
few
cottages
settling
peacefully
around
a
common
form
the
village
here
and
there
a
cottage
lurks
up
a
lane
these
cottages
are
mostly
inhabited
by
the
gentle
classes
some
are
really
old
with
great
oak
beams
across
the
low
ceilings
and
kitchens
furnished
with
great
open
fireplaces
where
you
can
sit
and
get
scorched
and
covered
with
smoke
some
are
new
built
in
imitation
of
the
old
by
a
mute
inglorious
adam
the
village
carpenter
all
have
long
casement
windows
front
gardens
in
which
grow
stocks
and
phlox
and
sunflowers
and
hollyhocks
and
roses
and
a
path
leads
from
the
front
gate
to
the
entrance
porch
nunsmere
is
very
quiet
and
restful
should
a
roisterer
cross
the
common
singing
a
song
at
nine
at
night
all
nunsmere
hears
it
and
is
shocked
if
not
frightened
to
the
extent
of
bolting
doors
and
windows
lest
the
dreadful
drunken
man
should
come
in
in
a
cottage
on
the
common
an
old
one
added
to
by
the
local
architect
with
a
front
garden
and
a
path
dwelt
oldrieve
in
entire
happiness
and
her
daughter
in
discontent
and
this
was
through
no
peevish
or
disagreeable
traits
in
zora
nature
if
we
hear
guy
fawkes
was
fretful
in
the
we
are
not
pained
by
guy
fawkes
lack
of
christian
resignation
when
the
vicar
and
the
literary
man
from
london
had
gone
zora
threw
open
the
window
and
let
the
soft
autumn
air
flood
the
room
oldrieve
drew
her
woolen
shawl
around
her
lean
shoulders
i
afraid
you
quite
snubbed
rattenden
just
when
he
was
saying
one
of
his
cleverest
things
he
said
it
to
the
wrong
person
mother
i
neither
a
faded
life
nor
am
i
going
to
be
laid
away
in
lavender
do
i
look
like
it
she
moved
across
the
room
swiftly
and
stood
in
the
slanting
light
from
the
window
offering
herself
for
inspection
nothing
could
be
less
like
a
faded
life
than
the
magnificent
woman
that
met
her
mother
gaze
her
hair
was
auburn
her
eyes
brown
with
gold
flecks
her
lips
red
her
cheeks
clear
and
young
she
was
cast
physically
in
heroic
mold
a
creature
of
dancing
blood
and
color
and
warmth
disparaging
called
her
an
amazon
the
vicar
wife
regarded
her
as
too
large
and
flaring
and
curvilinear
for
reputable
good
looks
she
towered
over
nunsmere
her
presence
disturbed
the
sedateness
of
the
place
she
was
a
wrong
note
in
its
harmony
oldrieve
sighed
she
was
small
and
colorless
her
husband
a
wild
explorer
a
tornado
of
a
man
had
been
killed
by
a
buffalo
she
was
afraid
that
zora
took
after
her
father
her
younger
daughter
emmy
had
also
inherited
some
of
the
oldrieve
restlessness
and
had
gone
on
the
stage
she
was
playing
now
in
musical
comedy
in
london
i
do
see
why
you
should
not
be
happy
here
zora
she
remarked
but
if
you
want
to
go
you
must
i
used
to
say
the
same
to
your
poor
dear
father
i
been
very
good
have
i
said
zora
i
been
the
model
young
widow
and
lived
as
demurely
as
if
my
heart
were
breaking
with
sorrow
but
now
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
going
out
to
see
the
world
you
soon
marry
again
dear
and
that
one
comfort
zora
brought
her
hands
down
passionately
to
her
sides
never
never
do
you
hear
mother
never
i
going
out
into
the
world
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
life
i
never
known
i
going
to
live
i
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
dear
without
a
man
to
take
care
of
you
said
oldrieve
on
whom
there
occasionally
flashed
an
eternal
verity
i
hate
men
i
hate
the
touch
of
them
the
very
sight
of
them
i
going
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
for
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
my
dear
mother
and
her
voice
broke
have
i
had
enough
to
do
with
men
and
marriage
all
men
are
like
edward
middlemist
oldrieve
argued
as
she
counted
the
rows
of
her
knitting
how
am
i
to
know
that
how
could
anyone
have
told
that
he
was
what
he
was
for
heaven
sake
do
talk
of
it
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
all
in
this
place
she
shuddered
and
turning
to
the
window
stared
into
the
sunset
lavender
has
its
uses
said
oldrieve
here
again
it
must
be
urged
on
zora
behalf
that
she
had
reason
for
her
misanthropy
it
is
not
cheerful
for
a
girl
to
discover
within
hours
of
her
wedding
that
her
husband
is
a
hopeless
drunkard
and
to
see
him
die
of
delirium
tremens
within
six
weeks
an
experience
so
vivid
like
lightning
must
blast
something
in
a
woman
conception
of
life
because
one
man
kisses
reeked
of
whisky
the
kisses
of
all
male
humanity
were
anathema
after
a
long
spell
of
silence
she
came
and
laid
her
cheek
against
her
mother
this
is
the
very
last
time
we
speak
of
it
dear
i
lock
the
skeleton
in
its
cupboard
and
throw
away
the
key
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
and
came
down
radiant
at
dinner
she
spoke
exultingly
of
her
approaching
freedom
she
would
tear
off
her
widow
weeds
and
deck
herself
in
the
flower
of
youth
she
would
plunge
into
the
great
swelling
sea
of
life
she
would
drink
sunshine
and
fill
her
soul
with
laughter
she
would
do
a
million
hyperbolic
things
the
mention
of
which
mightily
confused
her
mother
i
my
dear
said
the
hen
in
the
fairy
tale
never
had
the
faintest
desire
to
get
into
water
so
more
or
less
said
oldrieve
will
you
miss
me
very
dreadfully
asked
zora
of
course
but
her
tone
was
so
lacking
in
conviction
that
zora
laughed
mother
you
know
very
well
that
cousin
jane
will
be
a
more
sympathetic
companion
you
been
pining
for
her
all
this
time
cousin
jane
held
distinct
views
on
the
cut
of
for
the
deserving
poor
and
as
clouds
disperse
before
the
sun
so
did
household
dust
before
her
presence
untidiness
followed
in
zora
steps
as
it
does
in
those
of
the
physically
large
and
cousin
jane
disapproved
of
her
thoroughly
but
oldrieve
often
sighed
for
cousin
jane
as
she
had
never
sighed
for
zora
emily
or
her
husband
she
was
more
than
content
with
the
prospect
of
her
companionship
at
any
rate
my
dear
she
said
that
evening
as
she
paused
candle
in
hand
by
her
bedroom
door
at
any
rate
i
hope
you
do
nothing
that
is
unbecoming
to
a
gentlewoman
such
was
her
benison
zora
bumped
her
head
against
the
oak
beam
that
ran
across
her
bedroom
ceiling
it
quite
true
she
said
to
herself
the
place
is
too
small
for
me
i
do
fit
what
she
was
going
to
do
in
this
wide
world
into
whose
glories
she
was
about
to
enter
she
had
but
the
vaguest
notion
all
to
her
was
the
beautiful
unknown
narrow
means
had
kept
her
at
cheltenham
and
afterwards
at
nunsmere
all
her
life
she
had
met
her
husband
in
ipswich
while
she
was
paying
a
polite
visit
to
some
distant
cousins
she
had
married
him
offhand
in
a
whirl
of
the
senses
he
was
a
handsome
blackguard
of
independent
means
and
she
had
spent
her
nightmare
of
a
honeymoon
at
brighton
on
three
occasions
during
her
years
of
existence
she
had
spent
a
golden
week
in
london
that
was
all
she
knew
of
the
wide
world
it
was
not
very
much
reading
had
given
her
a
acquaintance
with
the
doings
of
various
classes
of
mankind
and
such
pictures
as
she
had
seen
had
filled
her
head
with
dreams
of
strange
and
wonderful
places
but
otherwise
she
was
ignorant
beautifully
childishly
ignorant
and
undismayed
what
was
she
going
to
do
sensitive
and
responsive
to
beauty
filled
with
artistic
impulses
she
could
neither
paint
act
sing
nor
write
pretty
little
stories
for
the
magazines
she
had
no
special
gift
to
develop
to
earn
her
living
in
a
humdrum
way
she
had
no
need
she
had
no
high
ibsenite
notions
of
working
out
her
own
individuality
she
had
no
consuming
passion
for
reforming
any
section
of
the
universe
she
had
no
mission
that
she
knew
of
to
accomplish
unlike
so
many
of
her
sex
who
yearn
to
be
as
men
and
go
out
into
the
world
she
had
no
inner
mandate
to
do
anything
no
ambition
to
be
anything
she
was
simply
a
great
rich
flower
struggling
through
the
shade
to
the
sunlight
plenty
of
sunlight
as
much
sunlight
as
the
heavens
could
give
her
the
literary
man
from
london
happened
to
be
returning
to
town
by
the
train
that
carried
zora
on
the
first
stage
of
her
pilgrimage
he
obtained
her
consent
to
travel
up
in
the
same
carriage
he
asked
her
to
what
branch
of
human
activity
she
intended
to
devote
herself
she
answered
that
she
was
going
to
lie
anyhow
among
the
leaves
he
rebuked
her
we
ought
said
he
to
justify
our
existence
she
drew
herself
up
and
flashed
an
indignant
glance
at
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologized
you
do
justify
yours
how
you
decorate
the
world
i
was
wrong
that
is
the
true
function
of
a
beautiful
woman
and
you
fulfill
it
i
have
in
my
bag
replied
zora
slowly
and
looking
at
him
a
preventive
against
i
have
a
waterproof
to
shelter
me
from
rain
but
what
can
i
do
to
shield
myself
against
silly
compliments
adopt
the
costume
of
the
ladies
of
the
orient
said
the
literary
man
from
london
unabashed
she
laughed
although
she
detested
him
he
bent
forward
with
humorous
earnestness
he
had
written
some
novels
and
now
edited
a
weekly
of
precious
tendencies
and
cynical
flavor
i
am
a
battered
old
man
of
said
he
and
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
wander
at
a
loose
end
about
europe
without
men
paying
you
compliments
and
falling
in
love
with
you
and
making
themselves
generally
delightful
you
traveling
under
a
grievous
hallucination
what
you
say
retorted
zora
confirms
me
in
my
opinion
that
men
are
an
abominable
nuisance
why
ca
they
let
a
poor
woman
go
about
in
peace
the
train
happened
to
be
waiting
at
clapham
junction
a
spruce
young
man
passing
by
on
the
platform
made
a
perceptible
pause
by
the
window
his
eyes
full
on
her
she
turned
her
head
impatiently
rattenden
laughed
dear
lady
said
he
i
must
impart
to
you
the
elements
of
wisdom
miss
keziah
skaffles
with
brain
cordage
for
hair
and
monoliths
for
teeth
and
a
box
of
dominoes
for
a
body
can
fool
about
unmolested
among
the
tribes
of
crim
tartary
she
does
worry
the
tartars
but
permit
me
to
say
it
as
you
are
for
the
moment
my
disciple
a
beautiful
woman
like
yourself
radiating
feminine
magnetism
worries
a
man
exceedingly
you
do
let
him
go
about
in
peace
so
why
should
he
let
you
i
think
said
zora
as
the
train
moved
on
that
miss
keziah
skaffles
is
very
much
to
be
envied
and
that
this
is
a
very
horrid
conversation
she
was
offended
in
her
delicacy
it
was
enough
to
make
her
regard
herself
with
repulsion
she
took
up
the
fashion
paper
she
had
bought
at
the
station
was
she
not
intending
to
run
delicious
riot
among
the
dressmakers
and
milliners
of
london
and
regarding
blankly
the
ungodly
waisted
ladies
in
the
illustrations
determined
to
wear
a
wig
and
paint
her
face
yellow
and
black
out
one
of
her
front
teeth
so
that
she
should
not
worry
the
tartars
i
am
only
warning
you
against
possible
dangers
said
rattenden
stiffly
he
did
not
like
his
conversation
to
be
called
horrid
to
the
race
of
men
no
to
yourself
she
laughed
scornfully
no
fear
of
that
why
does
every
man
think
himself
irresistible
because
he
generally
is
if
he
wants
to
be
said
the
literary
man
from
london
zora
caught
her
breath
well
of
all
she
began
yes
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
millions
of
women
have
said
it
and
eaten
their
words
why
should
you
beautiful
as
you
are
be
an
exception
to
the
law
of
life
you
going
out
to
suck
the
honey
of
the
world
and
men
hearts
will
be
your
flowers
instinct
will
drive
you
you
wo
be
able
to
get
away
from
it
you
think
you
going
to
be
thrilled
into
passionate
raptures
by
cathedrals
and
expensive
restaurants
and
the
set
pieces
of
fashionable
scenery
you
not
your
store
of
honey
will
consist
of
emotional
experiences
of
a
primitive
order
if
not
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
women
do
you
know
anything
about
them
she
asked
sweetly
more
than
would
be
becoming
of
me
to
tell
he
replied
anyhow
he
added
that
does
matter
i
made
my
prophecy
you
tell
me
afterwards
if
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
whether
it
has
come
true
it
wo
come
true
said
zora
we
shall
see
said
the
wise
man
she
dashed
that
afternoon
into
her
sister
tiny
flat
in
chelsea
emily
taken
by
surprise
hastily
stuffed
to
the
bottom
of
her
a
silk
tie
which
she
was
knitting
and
then
greeted
zora
affectionately
she
was
shorter
slimmer
paler
than
her
sister
of
a
certain
babyish
prettiness
she
had
oldrieve
weak
mouth
and
gentle
ways
why
zora
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
what
are
you
doing
in
town
getting
hats
and
frocks
a
trousseau
of
freedom
i
left
nunsmere
on
my
own
her
eyes
sparkled
her
cheeks
were
flushed
she
caught
emily
to
her
bosom
oh
darling
i
so
happy
a
bird
let
out
of
a
cage
an
awful
big
bird
laughed
emily
yes
let
out
of
an
awful
small
cage
i
going
to
see
the
world
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
going
to
get
out
of
the
cold
and
wet
going
south
to
italy
sicily
egypt
anywhere
all
by
yourself
there

turner
turner
ah
you
do
know
her
my
new
maid
but
is
it
glorious
why
you
come
with
me
darling
do
come
and
throw
up
my
engagement
i
could
i
should
love
it
but
you

how
hard
engagements
are
to

i
pay
for
everything
but
emily
shook
her
fluffy
head
she
had
a
good
part
a
few
lines
to
speak
and
a
bit
of
a
song
to
sing
in
a
successful
musical
comedy
she
looked
back
on
the
two
years
price
she
had
paid
for
that
little
bit
of
a
song
it
was
dearer
to
her
than
anything
save
one
thing
in
life
i
ca
besides
do
you
think
a
couple
of
girls
fooling
about
alone
look
rather
silly
it
would
really
be
very
funny
without
a
man
zora
rose
in
protest
the
whole
human
race
is
even
mother
i
think
everybody
is
detestable
the
maid
announced
mordaunt
prince
and
a
handsome
man
with
finely
cut
dark
features
and
black
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
brushed
tightly
back
over
the
head
entered
the
room
emmy
presented
him
to
zora
who
recognized
him
as
the
leading
man
at
the
theater
where
emmy
was
playing
zora
exchanged
a
few
polite
commonplaces
with
the
visitor
and
then
took
her
leave
emmy
accompanied
her
to
the
front
door
of
the
flat
is
he
charming
that
creature
asked
zora
emmy
laughed
in
your
present
mood
you
would
find
fault
with
an
archangel
darling
and
take
care
of
yourself
she
bore
no
malice
having
a
kind
heart
and
being
foolishly
happy
when
she
returned
to
the
the
man
took
both
her
hands
well
sweetheart
my
sister
wanted
to
carry
me
off
to
italy
what
did
you
say
guess
said
the
girl
lifting
starry
eyes
the
man
guessed
after
the
manner
of
men
and
for
a
moment
emmy
forgot
zora
who
went
her
own
way
in
pursuit
of
happiness
heedless
of
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
and
of
the
foolish
chapter
ii
for
five
months
zora
wandered
over
the
world
chiefly
italy
without
an
experience
which
might
be
called
an
adventure
when
the
literary
man
from
london
crossed
her
mind
she
laughed
him
to
scorn
for
a
prophetic
popinjay
she
had
broken
no
man
heart
and
her
own
was
whole
the
tribes
of
crim
tartary
had
exhibited
no
signs
of
worry
and
had
left
her
unmolested
she
had
furthermore
taken
rapturous
delight
in
cathedrals
expensive
restaurants
and
the
set
pieces
of
fashionable
scenery
rattenden
had
not
a
prophetic
leg
to
stand
on
yet
she
longed
for
the
unattainable
for
the
elusive
something
of
which
these
felicities
were
but
symbols
now
the
wanderer
with
a
haunting
sense
of
the
beyond
but
without
the
true
vagabond
divine
gift
of
piercing
the
veil
can
only
follow
the
obvious
and
there
are
seasons
when
the
obvious
fails
to
satisfy
when
such
a
mood
overcame
her
mistress
turner
railed
at
the
upsetting
quality
of
foreign
food
and
presented
bicarbonate
of
soda
she
arrived
by
a
different
path
at
the
unsatisfactory
nature
of
the
obvious
sometimes
too
the
pleasant
acquaintances
of
travel
were
lacking
and
loneliness
upset
the
nice
balance
of
zora
nerves
then
more
than
ever
did
she
pine
for
the
beyond
yet
youth
receptivity
imagination
kept
her
buoyant
hope
lured
her
on
with
renewed
promises
from
city
to
city
at
last
on
her
homeward
journey
he
whispered
the
magic
name
of
monte
carlo
and
her
heart
was
aflutter
in
anticipation
of
wonderland
she
stood
bewildered
lonely
and
dismayed
in
the
first
row
behind
the
chairs
fingering
an
empty
purse
she
had
been
in
the
rooms
ten
minutes
and
she
had
lost
twenty
louis
her
last
coup
had
been
successful
but
a
bland
old
lady
with
the
white
hair
and
waxen
face
of
sainted
motherhood
had
swept
up
her
winnings
so
unconcernedly
that
zora
brain
began
to
swim
as
she
felt
too
strange
and
shy
to
expostulate
she
stood
fingering
her
empty
purse
the
scene
was
utterly
different
from
what
she
had
expected
she
had
imagined
a
gay
crowded
room
wild
gamblers
shouting
in
their
excitement
a
band
playing
delirious
waltz
music
champagne
corks
popping
merrily
painted
women
laughing
jesting
loudly
all
kinds
of
revelry
and
devilry
and
bacchic
things
undreamed
of
this
was
silly
of
her
no
doubt
but
the
silliness
of
inexperienced
young
women
is
a
matter
for
the
pity
not
the
reprobation
of
the
judicious
if
they
take
the
world
for
their
oyster
and
think
when
they
open
it
they
are
going
to
find
pearl
necklaces
we
must
not
blame
them
rather
let
sinners
envy
them
their
imaginings
the
corners
of
zora
middlemist
ripe
lips
drooped
with
a
child
pathos
of
disillusionment
her
nose
delicately
marked
disgust
at
the
heavy
air
and
the
discord
of
scents
around
her
having
lost
her
money
she
could
afford
to
survey
with
scorn
the
decorous
yet
sordid
greed
of
the
crowded
table
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
gaiety
about
it
the
people
behaved
with
the
correct
impassiveness
of
an
anglican
congregation
she
had
heard
of
more
jocular
funerals
she
forgot
the
intoxication
of
her
first
gold
and
turquoise
day
at
monte
carlo
a
sense
of
loneliness
such
as
a
solitary
dove
might
feel
in
a
wilderness
of
evil
bats
oppressed
her
had
she
not
been
aware
that
she
was
a
remarkably
attractive
woman
and
the
object
of
innumerable
glances
she
would
have
cried
and
twenty
louis
pitched
into
unprofitable
space
yet
she
stood
half
fascinated
by
the
rattle
of
the
marble
on
the
revolving
disc
the
glitter
of
the
gold
the
soft
pat
of
the
coins
on
the
green
cloth
as
they
were
thrown
by
the
croupier
she
began
to
make
imaginary
stakes
for
five
coups
in
succession
she
would
have
won
it
was
exasperating
there
she
stood
having
pierced
the
innermost
mystery
of
chance
without
even
a
piece
in
her
purse
a
man
black
sleeve
pushed
past
her
shoulder
and
she
saw
a
hand
in
front
of
her
holding
a
louis
instinctively
she
took
it
thanks
said
a
tired
voice
i
ca
reach
the
table
she
threw
it
on
number
seventeen
and
then
with
a
start
realizing
what
she
had
done
she
turned
with
burning
cheeks
i
so
sorry
her
glance
met
a
pair
of
unspeculative
blue
eyes
belonging
to
the
owner
of
the
tired
voice
she
noted
that
he
had
a
sallow
face
a
little
brown
mustache
and
a
shock
of
brown
hair
curiously
upstanding
like
struwel
peter
i
am
sorry
she
repeated
please
ask
for
it
back
what
did
you
want
me
to
play
i
do
know
it
does
matter
so
long
as
you
put
it
somewhere
but
i
put
it
on
seventeen
she
urged
i
ought
to
have
thought
what
i
was
doing
why
think
he
murmured
middlemist
turned
square
to
the
table
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
staked
louis
in
spite
of
the
man
implied
acquiescence
she
felt
qualms
of
responsibility
why
had
she
not
played
on
an
even
chance
or
one
of
the
dozens
or
even
a
to
add
to
her
discomfort
no
one
else
played
the
full
seventeen
the
whole
table
seemed
silently
jeering
at
her
inexperience
the
croupiers
had
completed
the
payments
of
the
last
coup
the
marble
fell
with
its
sharp
click
and
whizzed
and
rattled
around
the
disc
zora
held
her
breath
the
marble
found
its
compartment
at
last
and
the
croupier
announced
noir
impair
et
manque
she
had
won
a
sigh
of
relief
shook
her
bosom
not
only
had
she
not
lost
a
stranger
money
but
she
had
won
for
him
times
his
stake
she
watched
the
louis
greedily
lest
it
should
be
swept
away
by
a
careless
croupier
perhaps
the
only
impossible
thing
that
could
not
happen
at
monte
carlo
and
stretched
out
her
arm
past
the
bland
old
lady
in
tense
determination
to
frustrate
further
felonious
proceedings
the
croupier
pitched
seven
large
gold
coins
across
the
table
she
clutched
them
feverishly
and
turned
to
deliver
them
to
their
owner
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
broke
through
the
ring
and
with
her
hands
full
of
gold
scanned
the
room
in
dismayed
perplexity
at
last
she
espied
him
standing
dejectedly
by
another
table
she
rushed
across
the
intervening
space
and
held
out
the
money
see
you
have
won
oh
lord
murmured
the
man
removing
his
hands
from
his
pockets
but
not
offering
to
take
his
winnings
what
a
lot
of
trouble
i
have
given
you
of
course
you
have
she
said
tartly
why
did
you
stay
i
do
know
he
replied
how
can
one
tell
why
one
does
do
things
well
please
take
the
money
now
and
let
me
get
rid
of
it
there
are
seven
pieces
of
five
louis
each
she
counted
the
coins
into
his
hand
and
then
suddenly
flushed
scarlet
she
had
forgotten
to
claim
the
original
louis
which
she
had
staked
where
was
it
what
had
become
of
it
as
well
try
she
thought
to
fish
up
a
coin
thrown
into
the
sea
she
felt
like
a
thief
there
ought
to
be
another
louis
she
stammered
it
does
matter
said
the
man
but
it
does
matter
you
might
think
that
i
i
kept
it
that
too
absurd
he
answered
are
you
interested
in
guns
guns
she
stared
at
him
he
appeared
quite
sane
i
remember
now
i
was
thinking
of
guns
when
i
went
away
he
explained
they
interesting
things
to
think
about
but
do
you
understand
that
i
owe
you
a
louis
i
forgot
all
about
it
if
my
purse
were
empty
i
would
repay
you
will
you
stay
here
till
i
can
get
some
money
from
my
hotel
the
hôtel
de
paris
she
spoke
with
some
vehemence
how
could
the
creature
expect
her
to
remain
in
his
debt
but
the
creature
only
passed
his
fingers
through
his
upstanding
hair
and
smiled
wanly
please
do
say
anything
more
about
it
it
distresses
me
the
croupiers
do
return
the
stake
as
a
general
rule
unless
you
ask
for
it
they
assume
you
want
to
back
your
luck
perhaps
it
has
won
again
for
sake
do
bother
about
it
and
thank
you
very
very
much
he
bowed
politely
and
moved
a
step
or
two
away
but
zora
struck
by
a
solution
of
the
mystery
which
had
not
occurred
to
her
as
one
can
not
grasp
all
the
ways
and
customs
of
gaming
establishments
in
ten
minutes
rushed
back
to
the
other
table
she
arrived
just
in
time
to
hear
the
croupier
asking
whom
the
louis
on
seventeen
belonged
to
the
number
had
turned
up
again
this
time
she
brought
the
louis
to
the
stranger
dear
me
said
he
taking
the
money
it
is
very
astonishing
but
why
did
you
trouble
because
i
a
woman
of
common
sense
i
suppose
he
looked
at
the
coins
in
his
hand
as
if
they
were
shells
which
a
child
at
the
seaside
might
have
brought
him
and
then
raised
his
eyes
slowly
to
hers
you
are
a
very
gracious
lady
his
glance
and
tone
checked
an
impulse
of
exasperation
she
smiled
at
any
rate
i
won
pounds
for
you
and
you
ought
to
be
grateful
he
made
a
little
gesture
of
acknowledgement
had
he
been
a
more
dashing
gentleman
he
might
have
expressed
his
gratitude
for
the
mere
privilege
of
conversing
with
a
gracious
lady
so
beautiful
they
had
drifted
from
the
outskirts
of
the
crowded
table
and
found
themselves
in
the
thinner
crowd
of
saunterers
it
was
the
height
of
the
monte
carlo
season
and
the
feathers
and
diamonds
and
rouge
and
greedy
eyes
and
rusty
bonnets
of
all
nations
confused
the
sight
and
paralyzed
thought
yet
among
all
the
women
of
both
worlds
zora
middlemist
stood
out
remarkable
as
septimus
dix
afterwards
explained
the
rooms
that
evening
contained
a
vague
kind
of
conglomerate
woman
and
zora
middlemist
and
the
herd
of
men
envied
the
creature
on
whom
she
smiled
so
graciously
she
was
dressed
in
black
as
became
a
young
widow
but
it
was
a
black
which
bore
no
sign
of
mourning
the
black
sweeping
ostrich
plume
of
a
picture
hat
gave
her
an
air
of
triumph
black
gloves
reaching
more
than
halfway
up
shapely
arms
and
a
gleam
of
snowy
neck
above
a
black
chiffon
bodice
disquieted
the
imagination
she
towered
over
her
present
companion
who
was
five
foot
seven
and
slimly
built
you
brought
me
all
this
stuff
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
he
asked
helplessly
perhaps
i
had
better
take
care
of
it
for
you
it
was
a
relief
from
the
oppressive
loneliness
to
talk
to
a
human
being
so
she
lingered
wistfully
in
conversation
a
pathetic
eagerness
came
into
the
man
face
i
wish
you
would
said
he
drawing
a
handful
from
his
jacket
pocket
i
should
be
so
much
happier
you
can
hardly
be
such
a
gambler
she
laughed
oh
no
it
not
that
at
all
gambling
bores
me
why
do
you
play
then
i
do
i
staked
that
louis
because
i
wanted
to
see
whether
i
should
be
interested
i
was
as
i
began
to
think
about
the
guns
have
you
had
breakfast
again
zora
was
startled
a
sane
man
does
not
talk
of
breakfasting
at
nine
in
the
evening
but
if
he
were
a
lunatic
perhaps
it
were
wise
to
humor
him
yes
she
said
have
you
no
i
only
just
got
up
do
you
mean
to
say
you
been
asleep
all
day
what
the
noisy
day
made
for
let
us
sit
down
said
zora
they
found
one
of
the
crimson
couches
by
the
wall
vacant
and
sat
down
zora
regarded
him
curiously
why
should
you
be
happier
if
i
took
care
of
your
money
i
should
spend
it
i
might
meet
a
man
who
wanted
to
sell
me
a
but
you
need
buy
it
these
fellows
are
so
persuasive
you
see
at
rotterdam
last
year
a
man
made
me
buy
a
dentist
chair
are
you
a
dentist
asked
zora
lord
no
if
i
were
i
could
have
used
the
horrible
chair
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
had
it
packed
up
and
despatched
carriage
paid
to
an
imaginary
person
at
singapore
he
made
this
announcement
in
his
tired
gentle
manner
without
the
flicker
of
a
smile
he
added
reflectively
that
sort
of
thing
becomes
expensive
do
you
find
it
so
i
would
defy
anybody
to
sell
me
a
thing
i
did
want
she
replied
ah
that
said
he
with
a
glance
of
wistful
admiration
that
is
because
you
have
red
hair
if
any
other
strange
male
had
talked
about
her
hair
zora
middlemist
would
have
drawn
herself
up
in
junoesque
majesty
and
blighted
him
with
a
glance
she
had
done
with
men
and
their
compliments
forever
in
that
she
prided
herself
on
her
amazonianism
but
she
could
not
be
angry
with
the
inconclusive
being
to
whom
she
was
talking
as
well
resent
the
ingenuous
remarks
of
a
child
what
has
my
red
hair
to
do
with
it
she
asked
pleasantly
it
was
a
man
who
sold
me
the
dentist
chair
oh
said
zora
nonplussed
there
was
a
pause
the
man
leaned
back
embracing
one
knee
with
both
hands
they
were
nerveless
indeterminate
hands
with
long
fingers
such
as
are
in
the
habit
of
dropping
things
zora
wondered
how
they
supported
his
knee
for
some
time
he
stared
into
vacancy
his
eyes
adream
zora
laughed
guns
she
asked
no
said
he
awaking
to
her
presence
perambulators
she
rose
i
thought
you
might
be
thinking
of
breakfast
i
must
be
going
back
to
my
hotel
these
rooms
are
too
hot
and
horrible
good
night
i
will
see
you
to
the
lift
if
you
allow
me
he
said
politely
she
graciously
assented
and
they
left
the
rooms
together
in
the
atrium
she
changed
her
mind
about
the
lift
she
would
leave
the
casino
by
the
main
entrance
and
walk
over
to
the
hôtel
de
paris
for
the
sake
of
a
breath
of
fresh
air
at
the
top
of
the
steps
she
paused
and
filled
her
lungs
it
was
a
still
moonless
night
and
the
stars
hung
low
down
like
diamonds
on
a
canopy
of
black
velvet
they
made
the
flaring
lights
of
the
terrace
of
the
hôtel
and
café
de
paris
look
tawdry
and
meretricious
i
hate
them
she
said
pointing
to
the
latter
stars
are
better
said
her
companion
she
turned
on
him
swiftly
how
did
you
know
i
was
making
comparisons
i
felt
it
he
murmured
they
walked
slowly
down
the
steps
at
the
bottom
a
carriage
and
pair
seemed
to
rise
mysteriously
out
of
the
earth
a
drive
ver
good
carriage
said
a
voice
out
of
the
dimness
monte
carlo
cabmen
are
unerring
in
their
divination
of
the
why
not
the
suggestion
awoke
in
her
an
instant
craving
for
the
true
beauty
of
the
land
it
was
unconventional
audacious
crazy
but
again
why
not
zora
middlemist
was
answerable
for
her
actions
to
no
man
or
woman
alive
why
not
drink
a
great
draught
of
the
freedom
that
was
hers
what
did
it
matter
that
the
man
was
a
stranger
all
the
more
daring
the
adventure
her
heart
beat
gladly
but
chaste
women
like
children
know
instinctively
the
man
they
can
trust
shall
we
drive
yes
unless
a
thought
suddenly
striking
her
unless
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
friends
good
lord
said
he
aghast
as
if
she
were
accusing
him
of
criminal
associations
i
have
no
friends
then
come
she
entered
the
carriage
he
followed
meekly
and
sat
beside
her
where
should
they
drive
the
cabman
suggested
the
coast
road
to
mentone
she
agreed
on
the
point
of
starting
she
observed
that
her
companion
was
you
forgotten
your
hat
she
spoke
to
him
as
she
would
have
done
to
a
child
why
bother
about
hats
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
go
and
get
it
at
once
he
obeyed
with
a
docility
which
sent
a
little
tingle
of
exaltation
through
middlemist
a
woman
may
have
an
inordinate
antipathy
to
men
but
she
loves
them
to
do
her
bidding
zora
was
a
woman
she
was
also
young
he
returned
the
cabman
whipped
up
his
strong
pair
of
horses
and
they
started
through
the
town
towards
mentone
zora
lay
back
on
the
cushions
and
drank
in
the
sensuous
loveliness
of
the
night
the
warm
scented
air
the
velvet
and
diamond
sky
the
fragrant
orange
groves
the
dim
mysterious
olive
trees
the
looming
hills
the
silken
sea
with
its
faint
edging
of
lace
on
the
dusky
sweep
of
the
bay
the
spirit
of
the
south
overspread
her
with
its
wings
and
took
her
amorously
in
its
arms
after
a
long
long
silence
she
sighed
remembering
her
companion
thank
you
for
not
talking
she
said
softly
do
he
replied
i
had
nothing
to
say
i
never
talk
i
scarcely
talked
for
a
year
she
laughed
idly
why
no
one
to
talk
to
except
my
man
he
added
conscientiously
his
name
is
wiggleswick
i
hope
he
looks
after
you
well
said
zora
with
a
touch
of
maternal
instinct
he
wants
training
that
what
i
am
always
telling
him
but
he
ca
hear
he
seventy
and
but
he
interesting
he
tells
me
about
jails
and
things
jails
yes
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
prison
he
was
a
professional
burglar
but
then
he
got
on
in
years
besides
the
younger
generation
was
knocking
at
the
door
i
thought
that
was
the
last
thing
a
burglar
would
do
said
zora
they
generally
use
jemmies
he
said
gravely
wiggleswick
has
given
me
his
collection
they
very
useful
what
for
she
asked
to
kill
moths
with
he
replied
dreamily
but
what
made
you
take
a
superannuated
burglar
for
a
valet
i
do
know
perhaps
it
was
wiggleswick
himself
he
came
up
to
me
one
day
as
i
was
sitting
in
kensington
gardens
and
somehow
followed
me
home
but
good
gracious
cried
zora
forgetful
for
the
moment
of
stars
and
sea
are
you
afraid
that
he
will
rob
you
no
i
asked
him
and
he
explained
you
see
it
would
be
out
of
his
line
a
forger
only
forges
a
pickpocket
only
snatches
chains
and
purses
and
a
burglar
only
burgles
now
he
could
burgle
the
place
in
which
he
was
living
himself
so
i
am
safe
zora
gave
him
sage
counsel
i
get
rid
of
him
if
i
were
you
if
i
were
you
i
would
but
i
ca
he
replied
if
i
told
him
to
go
he
would
i
go
instead
sometimes
that
why
i
here
if
you
go
on
talking
like
that
you
make
my
brain
reel
said
zora
laughing
do
tell
me
something
about
yourself
what
is
your
name
septimus
dix
i
got
another
name
ajax
septimus
ajax
dix
but
i
never
use
it
that
a
pity
said
zora
ajax
is
a
lovely
name
he
dissented
in
his
vague
fashion
ajax
suggests
somebody
who
defies
lightning
and
fools
about
with
a
spear
it
a
silly
name
a
maiden
aunt
persuaded
my
mother
to
give
it
to
me
i
think
she
mixed
it
up
with
achilles
she
admired
the
statue
in
hyde
park
she
got
run
over
by
a
milkcart
when
was
that
she
inquired
more
out
of
politeness
than
interest
in
the
career
of
dix
maiden
aunt
a
minute
before
she
died
oh
said
zora
taken
aback
by
the
emotionless
manner
in
which
he
mentioned
the
tragedy
then
by
way
of
continuing
the
conversation
why
are
you
called
septimus
i
the
seventh
son
all
the
others
died
young
i
never
could
make
out
why
i
did
perhaps
said
zora
with
a
laugh
you
were
thinking
of
something
else
at
the
time
and
lost
the
opportunity
it
must
have
been
that
said
he
i
lose
opportunities
just
as
i
always
lose
trains
how
do
you
manage
to
get
anywhere
i
wait
for
the
next
train
that
easy
but
there
never
another
opportunity
he
drew
a
cigarette
from
his
case
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
fumbled
in
his
pockets
for
matches
finding
none
he
threw
the
cigarette
into
the
road
that
just
like
you
cried
zora
why
did
you
ask
the
cabman
for
a
light
she
laughed
at
him
with
an
odd
sense
of
intimacy
though
she
had
known
him
for
scarcely
an
hour
he
seemed
rather
a
stray
child
than
a
man
she
longed
to
befriend
him
to
do
something
for
him
motherwise
she
knew
not
what
her
adventure
by
now
had
failed
to
be
adventurous
the
spice
of
danger
had
vanished
she
knew
she
could
sit
beside
this
helpless
being
till
the
day
of
doom
without
fear
of
molestation
by
word
or
act
he
obtained
a
light
for
his
cigarette
from
the
cabman
and
smoked
in
silence
gradually
the
languor
of
the
night
again
stole
over
her
senses
and
she
forgot
his
existence
the
carriage
had
turned
homeward
and
at
a
bend
of
the
road
high
up
above
the
sea
monte
carlo
came
into
view
gleaming
white
far
away
below
like
a
group
of
fairy
palaces
lit
by
fairy
lamps
sheltered
by
the
great
black
promontory
of
monaco
from
the
gorge
on
the
left
the
terraced
rock
on
the
right
came
the
smell
of
the
wild
thyme
and
rosemary
and
the
perfume
of
pale
flowers
the
touch
of
the
air
on
her
cheek
was
a
warm
and
scented
kiss
the
diamond
stars
drooped
towards
her
like
a
danaë
shower
like
danaë
her
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
strained
far
beyond
the
stars
into
an
unknown
glory
and
her
heart
throbbed
with
a
passionate
desire
for
unknown
things
of
what
nature
they
might
be
she
did
not
dream
not
love
zora
middlemist
had
forsworn
it
not
the
worship
of
a
man
she
had
vowed
by
all
the
saints
in
her
hierarchy
that
no
man
should
ever
again
enter
her
life
her
soul
revolted
against
the
unutterable
sex
as
soon
as
one
realizes
the
exquisite
humbug
of
sublunary
existence
he
must
weep
for
the
pity
of
it
the
warm
and
scented
air
was
a
kiss
too
on
the
cheek
of
septimus
dix
and
his
senses
too
were
enthralled
by
the
witchery
of
the
night
but
for
him
stars
and
scented
air
and
the
magic
beauty
of
the
sea
were
incarnate
in
the
woman
by
his
side
zora
as
i
have
said
had
forgotten
the
poor
devil
existence
chapter
iii
when
they
drove
up
to
the
hôtel
de
paris
she
alighted
and
bade
him
a
smiling
farewell
and
went
to
her
room
with
the
starlight
in
her
eyes
the
lift
man
asked
if
madame
had
won
she
dangled
her
empty
purse
and
laughed
then
the
lift
man
who
had
seen
that
light
in
women
eyes
before
made
certain
that
she
was
in
love
and
opened
the
lift
door
for
her
with
the
confidential
air
of
the
latin
who
knows
sweet
secrets
but
the
lift
man
was
wrong
no
man
had
a
part
in
her
soul
exultation
if
septimus
dix
crossed
her
mind
while
she
was
undressing
it
was
as
a
grotesque
bearing
the
same
relation
to
her
emotional
impression
of
the
night
as
a
gargoyle
does
to
a
cathedral
when
she
went
to
bed
she
slept
the
sound
sleep
of
youth
septimus
after
dismissing
the
cab
wandered
in
his
vague
way
over
to
the
café
de
paris
instinct
suggesting
his
belated
breakfast
which
like
his
existence
zora
had
forgotten
the
waiter
came
désire
absinthe
murmured
septimus
and
er
poached
eggs
and
anything
a
raspberry
ice
the
waiter
gazed
at
him
in
stupefaction
but
nothing
being
too
astounding
in
monte
carlo
he
wiped
the
cold
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
executed
the
order
the
unholy
meal
being
over
septimus
drifted
into
the
square
and
spent
most
of
the
night
on
a
bench
gazing
at
the
hôtel
de
paris
and
wondering
which
were
her
windows
when
she
mentioned
casually
a
day
or
two
later
that
her
windows
looked
the
other
way
over
the
sea
he
felt
that
destiny
had
fooled
him
once
more
but
for
the
time
being
he
found
a
gentle
happiness
in
his
speculation
chilled
to
the
bone
at
last
he
sought
his
hotel
bedroom
and
smoked
a
pipe
meditative
with
his
hat
on
until
the
morning
then
he
went
to
bed
two
mornings
afterwards
zora
came
upon
him
on
the
casino
terrace
he
sprawled
idly
on
a
bench
between
a
fat
german
and
his
fat
wife
who
were
talking
across
him
his
straw
hat
was
tilted
over
his
eyes
and
his
legs
were
crossed
in
spite
of
the
conversation
and
a
german
does
not
whisper
when
he
talks
to
his
wife
and
the
going
and
coming
of
the
crowd
in
spite
of
the
sunshine
and
the
blue
air
he
slumbered
peacefully
zora
passed
him
once
or
twice
then
by
the
station
lift
she
paused
and
looked
out
at
the
bay
of
mentone
clasping
the
sea
a
blue
enamel
in
a
setting
of
gold
she
stood
for
some
moments
lost
in
the
joy
of
it
when
a
voice
behind
her
brought
her
back
to
the
commonplace
very
lovely
is
it
a
englishman
of
uncertain
age
and
yellow
evil
eyes
met
her
glance
as
she
turned
instinctively
yes
it
beautiful
she
replied
coldly
but
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
to
me
i
could
help
sharing
my
emotions
with
another
especially
one
so
beautiful
you
seem
to
be
alone
here
now
she
remembered
having
seen
him
before
rather
frequently
the
previous
evening
he
had
somewhat
ostentatiously
selected
a
table
near
hers
at
dinner
he
had
watched
her
as
she
had
left
the
theater
and
followed
her
to
the
lift
door
he
had
been
watching
for
his
opportunity
and
now
thought
it
had
come
she
shivered
with
sudden
anger
and
round
her
heart
crept
the
chill
of
fright
which
all
women
know
who
have
been
followed
in
a
lonely
street
i
certainly
am
not
alone
she
said
wrathfully
good
morning
the
man
covered
his
defeat
by
raising
his
hat
with
ironic
politeness
and
zora
walked
swiftly
away
in
appearance
a
majestic
amazon
but
inwardly
a
quivering
woman
she
marched
straight
up
to
the
recumbent
dix
the
literary
man
from
london
would
have
been
amused
she
interposed
herself
between
the
conversing
teutons
and
awakened
the
sleeper
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
dreamy
smile
then
leaped
to
his
feet
a
man
has
insulted
me
he
has
been
following
me
about
and
tried
to
get
into
conversation
with
me
dear
me
said
septimus
what
shall
i
do
shall
i
shoot
him
do
be
silly
she
said
seriously
it
serious
i
be
glad
if
kindly
walk
up
and
down
a
little
with
me
with
pleasure
they
strolled
away
together
but
i
serious
if
you
wanted
me
to
shoot
him
i
do
it
i
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
i
got
a
revolver
in
my
room
she
laughed
disclaiming
desire
for
supreme
vengeance
i
only
want
to
show
the
wretch
that
i
am
not
a
helpless
woman
she
observed
with
the
bewildering
illogic
of
the
sex
and
as
she
passed
by
the
offender
she
smiled
down
at
her
companion
with
all
the
sweetness
of
intimacy
and
asked
him
why
he
carried
a
revolver
she
did
not
point
the
offender
out
be
it
remarked
to
the
bloodthirsty
septimus
it
belongs
to
wiggleswick
he
replied
in
answer
to
her
question
i
promised
to
take
care
of
it
for
him
what
does
wiggleswick
do
when
you
are
away
he
reads
the
police
reports
i
take
in
and
the
of
the
and
the
illustrated
for
him
and
he
cuts
them
out
and
gums
them
in
a
scrap
book
but
i
think
i
happier
without
wiggleswick
he
interferes
with
my
guns
by
the
way
said
zora
you
talked
about
guns
the
other
evening
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
guns
he
looked
at
her
in
a
scared
way
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
though
to
make
sure
she
was
loyal
and
worthy
of
confidence
and
then
he
said
i
invent
i
have
written
a
treatise
on
guns
of
large
caliber
really
cried
zora
taken
by
surprise
she
had
not
credited
him
with
so
serious
a
vocation
do
tell
me
something
about
it
not
now
he
pleaded
some
other
time
i
have
to
sit
down
with
paper
and
pencil
and
draw
diagrams
i
afraid
you
would
like
it
wiggleswick
does
it
bores
him
you
must
be
born
with
machinery
in
your
blood
sometimes
it
uncomfortable
to
have
cogwheels
instead
of
corpuscles
must
be
trying
said
zora
flippantly
very
said
he
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
them
clear
of
the
heart
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
quickly
whatever
one
does
or
tries
to
do
one
should
insist
on
remaining
human
it
good
to
be
human
is
it
i
once
knew
a
man
who
was
just
a
complicated
mechanism
of
brain
encased
in
a
body
his
heart
did
beat
it
clicked
and
whirred
it
caused
the
death
of
the
most
perfect
woman
in
the
world
he
looked
dreamily
into
the
blue
ether
between
sea
and
sky
zora
felt
strangely
drawn
to
him
who
was
it
she
asked
softly
my
mother
said
he
they
had
paused
in
their
stroll
and
were
leaning
over
the
parapet
above
the
railway
line
after
a
few
moments
silence
he
added
with
a
faint
smile
that
why
i
try
hard
to
keep
myself
human
so
that
if
a
woman
should
ever
care
for
me
i
should
hurt
her
a
green
caterpillar
was
crawling
on
his
sleeve
in
his
vague
manner
he
picked
it
tenderly
off
and
laid
it
on
the
leaf
of
an
aloe
that
grew
in
the
terrace
vase
near
which
he
stood
you
could
even
hurt
that
crawling
thing
let
alone
a
woman
said
zora
this
time
very
softly
he
blushed
if
you
kill
a
caterpillar
you
kill
a
butterfly
he
said
apologetically
and
if
you
kill
a
woman
is
there
anything
higher
said
he
she
made
no
reply
her
misanthropical
philosophy
prompting
none
there
was
rather
a
long
silence
which
he
broke
by
asking
her
if
she
read
persian
he
excused
his
knowledge
of
it
by
saying
that
it
kept
him
human
she
laughed
and
suggested
a
continuance
of
their
stroll
he
talked
disconnectedly
as
they
walked
up
and
down
the
crowd
on
the
terrace
thinned
as
the
hour
of
déjeuner
approached
presently
she
proclaimed
her
hunger
he
murmured
that
it
must
be
near
dinner
time
she
protested
he
passed
his
hands
across
his
eyes
and
confessed
that
he
had
got
mixed
up
in
his
meals
the
last
few
days
then
an
idea
struck
him
if
i
skip
afternoon
tea
and
dinner
and
supper
and
petit
déjeuner
and
have
two
breakfasts
running
he
exclaimed
brightly
i
shall
begin
fair
again
and
he
laughed
not
loud
but
murmuringly
for
the
first
time
they
went
round
the
casino
to
the
front
of
the
hôtel
de
paris
their
natural
parting
place
but
there
on
the
steps
with
legs
apart
stood
the
wretch
with
the
evil
eyes
he
looked
at
her
from
afar
banteringly
defiance
rose
in
zora
soul
she
would
again
show
him
that
she
was
not
a
lone
and
helpless
woman
at
the
mercy
of
the
casual
depredator
i
taking
you
in
to
lunch
with
me
dix
you
ca
refuse
she
said
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
sailed
majestically
past
the
wretch
followed
meekly
by
septimus
as
if
she
owned
him
body
and
soul
as
usual
many
eyes
were
turned
on
her
as
she
entered
the
restaurant
a
radiant
figure
in
white
with
black
hat
and
black
chiffon
boa
and
a
deep
red
rose
in
her
bosom
the
maître
in
the
pride
of
reflected
glory
conducted
her
to
a
table
near
the
window
septimus
trailed
inconclusively
behind
when
he
seated
himself
he
stared
at
her
silently
in
a
mute
surmise
as
the
gentlemen
in
the
poem
did
at
the
peak
in
darien
it
was
even
a
wilder
adventure
than
the
memorable
drive
that
was
but
a
caprice
of
the
goddess
this
was
a
sign
of
her
friendship
the
newness
of
their
intimacy
smote
him
dumb
he
passed
his
hand
through
his
struwel
peter
hair
and
wondered
was
it
real
there
sat
the
goddess
separated
from
him
by
the
strip
of
damask
her
eyes
smiling
frankly
and
trustfully
into
his
pulling
off
her
gloves
and
disclosing
in
almost
disconcerting
intimacy
her
warm
wrists
and
hands
was
he
dreaming
as
he
sometimes
did
in
broad
daylight
of
a
queer
heaven
in
which
he
was
strong
like
other
men
and
felt
the
flutter
of
wings
upon
his
cheek
something
soft
was
in
his
hand
mechanically
he
began
to
stuff
it
up
his
sleeve
it
was
his
napkin
zora
laugh
brought
him
to
earth
to
happy
earth
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
linger
over
lunch
on
the
terrace
of
the
hôtel
de
paris
outside
is
the
shade
of
the
square
the
blazing
sunshine
beyond
the
shadow
the
fountain
and
the
palms
and
the
doves
the
white
gaiety
of
pleasure
houses
the
mountains
cut
sharp
against
the
violet
sky
inside
a
symphony
of
cool
tones
the
pearl
of
summer
dresses
the
snow
crystal
and
silver
of
the
tables
the
tender
green
of
lettuce
the
yellows
of
fruit
the
soft
pink
of
salmon
here
and
there
a
bold
note
of
color
the
flowers
in
a
woman
hat
the
purples
and
topazes
of
wine
nearer
still
to
the
sense
is
the
charm
of
privacy
the
one
human
being
for
you
in
the
room
is
your
companion
the
space
round
your
chairs
is
a
magic
circle
cutting
you
off
from
the
others
who
are
mere
decorations
beautiful
or
grotesque
between
you
are
substances
which
it
were
gross
to
call
food
dainty
mysteries
of
coolness
and
sudden
flavors
a
fish
salad
in
which
the
essences
of
sea
and
land
are
blended
in
cold
celestial
harmony
innermost
kernels
of
the
lamb
of
the
salted
meadows
where
must
grow
the
asphodel
on
which
it
fed
in
amorous
union
with
what
men
call
a
sauce
but
really
oil
and
cream
and
herbs
stirred
by
a
god
in
a
dream
peaches
in
purple
ichor
chastely
clad
in
snow
melting
on
the
palate
as
the
voice
of
the
divine
singer
after
whom
they
are
named
melts
in
the
soul
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
hedonistic
yes
but
why
live
on
lentils
when
lotus
is
to
your
hand
and
really
at
monte
carlo
lentils
are
quite
as
expensive
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
even
for
the
wanderer
of
many
restaurants
to
lunch
at
the
hôtel
de
paris
but
for
the
young
and
to
whom
it
is
new
it
is
enchantment
i
often
looked
at
people
eating
like
this
and
i
often
wondered
how
it
felt
said
septimus
but
you
must
have
lunched
hundreds
of
times
in
such
places
yes
but
by
myself
i
never
had
a
he
paused
a
what
a
a
gracious
lady
he
said
reddening
to
sit
opposite
me
why
not
no
one
has
ever
wanted
me
it
has
always
puzzled
me
how
men
get
to
know
women
and
go
about
with
them
i
think
it
must
be
a
gift
he
asserted
with
the
profound
gravity
of
a
man
who
has
solved
a
psychological
problem
some
fellows
have
a
gift
for
collecting
toby
jugs
everywhere
they
go
they
discover
a
toby
jug
i
could
find
one
if
i
tried
for
a
year
it
the
same
thing
at
cambridge
they
used
to
call
me
the
owl
an
owl
catches
mice
at
any
rate
said
zora
so
do
i
do
you
like
mice
no
i
want
to
catch
lions
and
tigers
and
all
the
bright
and
burning
things
of
life
cried
zora
in
a
burst
of
confidence
he
regarded
her
with
wistful
admiration
your
whole
life
must
be
full
of
such
things
i
wonder
she
said
looking
at
him
over
the
spoonful
of
pêche
melba
which
she
was
going
to
put
in
her
mouth
i
wonder
whether
you
have
the
faintest
idea
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
and
what
i
doing
here
all
by
myself
and
why
you
and
i
are
lunching
together
in
this
delightful
fashion
you
have
told
me
all
about
yourself
but
you
seem
to
take
me
for
granted
she
was
ever
so
little
piqued
at
his
apparent
indifference
but
if
men
like
septimus
dix
did
not
take
women
for
granted
where
would
be
the
chivalry
and
faith
of
the
children
of
the
world
he
accepted
her
unquestioningly
as
the
simple
trojan
accepted
the
olympian
lady
who
appeared
to
him
clad
in
grace
but
otherwise
scantily
from
a
rosy
cloud
you
are
yourself
he
said
and
that
has
been
enough
for
me
how
do
you
know
i
not
an
adventuress
there
are
heaps
of
them
people
say
in
this
place
i
might
be
a
designing
thief
of
a
woman
i
offered
you
the
charge
of
my
money
the
other
night
was
that
why
you
did
it
to
test
me
she
asked
he
reddened
and
started
as
if
stung
she
saw
the
hurt
instantly
and
with
a
gush
of
remorse
begged
for
forgiveness
no
i
did
mean
it
it
was
horrid
of
me
it
is
not
in
your
nature
to
think
such
a
thing
forgive
me
frankly
impulsively
she
stretched
her
hand
across
the
table
he
touched
it
timidly
with
his
ineffectual
fingers
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
vaguely
wondering
whether
he
should
raise
it
to
his
lips
and
so
kept
touching
it
until
she
pressed
his
fingers
in
a
little
grip
of
friendliness
and
withdrew
it
with
a
laugh
do
you
know
i
still
have
that
money
he
said
pulling
a
handful
of
great
pieces
from
his
pocket
i
ca
spend
it
i
tried
to
i
bought
a
dog
yesterday
but
he
wanted
to
bite
me
and
i
had
to
give
him
to
the
hotel
porter
all
this
gold
makes
such
a
bulge
in
my
pocket
when
zora
explained
that
the
coins
were
only
used
as
counters
and
could
be
changed
for
notes
at
the
rooms
he
was
astonished
at
her
sapience
he
had
never
thought
of
it
thus
zora
regained
her
sense
of
superiority
this
lunch
was
the
first
of
many
meals
they
had
together
and
meals
led
to
drives
and
excursions
and
to
evenings
at
the
theater
if
she
desired
still
further
to
convince
the
wretch
with
the
evil
eyes
of
her
befriended
state
she
succeeded
but
the
wretch
and
his
friends
speculated
evilly
on
the
relations
between
her
and
septimus
dix
they
credited
her
with
pots
of
money
zora
however
walked
serene
unconscious
of
slander
enjoying
herself
prodigiously
secure
in
her
scorn
and
hatred
of
men
she
saw
no
harm
in
her
actions
nor
was
there
any
from
the
point
of
view
of
her
young
egotism
and
inexperience
it
scarcely
occurred
to
her
that
septimus
was
a
man
in
some
aspects
he
appealed
to
her
instinctive
motherhood
like
a
child
when
she
met
him
one
day
coming
out
of
one
of
the
shops
in
the
arcade
wearing
a
newly
bought
homburg
hat
too
small
for
him
she
marched
him
back
with
a
delicious
sense
of
responsibility
and
stood
over
him
till
he
was
adequately
fitted
in
other
aspects
he
was
like
a
woman
in
whose
shy
delicacy
she
could
confide
she
awoke
also
to
a
new
realization
that
of
power
now
to
use
power
with
propriety
needs
wisdom
and
the
woman
who
is
wise
at
can
not
make
out
at
sixty
why
she
has
remained
an
old
maid
the
delightful
way
to
use
it
is
that
of
a
babe
when
he
first
discovers
that
a
stick
hits
that
is
the
way
that
zora
who
was
not
wise
used
it
over
septimus
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
owned
a
human
being
a
former
joy
in
the
possession
of
a
devoted
dog
who
did
tricks
was
as
nothing
to
this
rapture
it
was
splendid
she
owned
him
whenever
she
had
a
desire
for
his
company
which
was
often
as
solitude
at
monte
carlo
is
more
depressing
than
zora
had
realized
she
sent
a
page
boy
in
the
true
quality
of
his
name
of
to
hunt
down
the
quarry
and
bring
him
back
he
would
therefore
be
awakened
at
unearthly
hours
at
three
in
the
afternoon
for
instance
when
as
he
said
all
rational
beings
should
be
asleep
it
being
their
own
unreason
if
they
were
not
or
he
would
be
tracked
down
at
ten
in
the
morning
to
some
obscure
little
café
in
the
town
where
he
would
be
discovered
eating
ices
and
looking
the
worse
for
wear
in
his
clothes
of
the
night
before
as
this
meant
delay
in
the
execution
of
her
wishes
zora
prescribed
habits
less
irregular
by
means
of
bribery
of
chambermaids
and
porters
and
the
sacrifice
of
food
and
sleep
he
contrived
to
find
himself
dressed
in
decent
time
in
the
mornings
he
would
then
patiently
await
her
orders
or
call
modestly
for
them
at
her
residence
like
the
butcher
or
the
greengrocer
why
does
your
hair
stand
up
on
end
in
that
queer
fashion
she
asked
him
one
day
the
hat
episode
had
led
to
a
general
regulation
of
his
personal
appearance
he
pondered
gravely
over
the
conundrum
for
some
time
and
then
replied
that
he
must
have
lost
control
over
it
the
command
went
forth
that
he
should
visit
a
barber
and
learn
how
to
control
his
hair
he
obeyed
and
returned
with
his
shock
parted
in
the
middle
and
plastered
down
heavily
with
pomatum
a
saint
of
more
than
methodistical
meekness
on
zora
declaring
that
he
looked
awful
he
was
indeed
inconceivably
hideous
and
that
she
preferred
struwel
peter
after
all
he
dutifully
washed
his
head
with
soda
after
grave
consultation
with
the
chambermaid
and
sunned
himself
once
more
in
the
smiles
of
his
mistress
now
and
then
however
as
she
was
kind
and
not
tyrannical
she
felt
a
of
compunction
if
you
would
rather
do
anything
else
do
hesitate
to
say
so
but
septimus
after
having
contemplated
the
world
potentialities
of
action
with
eye
would
declare
that
there
was
nothing
else
that
could
be
done
then
she
could
rate
him
soundly
if
i
proposed
that
we
should
sail
up
the
andes
and
eat
fried
moonbeams
you
would
say
why
have
you
more
initiative
i
like
shandy
he
replied
some
people
are
born
so
they
are
quiescent
other
people
can
jump
about
like
grasshoppers
do
you
know
grasshoppers
are
very
interesting
and
he
began
to
talk
irrelevantly
on
insects
their
intercourse
encouraged
confidential
autobiography
zora
learned
the
whole
of
his
barren
history
fatherless
motherless
brotherless
he
was
alone
in
the
world
from
his
father
sir
erasmus
dix
a
engineer
to
whose
early
repression
much
of
septimus
timidity
was
due
he
had
inherited
a
modest
fortune
after
leaving
cambridge
he
had
wandered
aimlessly
about
europe
now
he
lived
in
a
little
house
in
shepherd
bush
with
a
studio
or
shed
at
the
end
of
the
garden
which
he
used
as
a
laboratory
why
shepherd
bush
asked
zora
wiggleswick
likes
it
said
he
and
now
he
has
the
whole
house
to
himself
i
suppose
he
makes
himself
comfortable
in
your
quarters
and
drinks
your
wine
and
smokes
your
cigars
with
his
friends
did
you
lock
things
up
oh
yes
of
course
said
septimus
and
where
are
the
keys
why
wiggleswick
has
them
he
replied
zora
drew
in
her
breath
you
do
know
how
angry
you
make
me
if
ever
i
meet
wiggleswick
well
i
talk
to
him
said
zora
with
a
fine
air
of
menace
she
on
her
side
gave
him
such
of
her
confidences
as
were
meet
for
masculine
ears
naturally
she
impressed
upon
him
the
fact
that
his
sex
was
abhorrent
to
her
in
all
its
physical
moral
and
spiritual
manifestations
septimus
on
thinking
the
matter
over
agreed
with
her
memories
came
back
to
him
of
the
men
with
whom
he
had
been
intimate
his
father
the
mechanical
man
who
had
cogs
instead
of
corpuscles
in
his
blood
wiggleswick
the
undesirable
a
few
rowdy
men
on
his
staircase
at
cambridge
who
had
led
shocking
lives
once
making
a
bonfire
of
his
pyjamas
and
a
umbrella
in
the
middle
of
the
court
and
had
since
come
to
early
and
disastrous
ends
his
impressions
of
the
sex
were
distinctly
bad
germs
of
unutterable
depravity
he
was
sure
lurked
somewhere
in
his
own
nature
you
make
me
feel
said
he
as
if
i
were
fit
to
black
the
boots
of
jezebel
that
a
proper
frame
of
mind
said
zora
would
you
be
good
and
tie
this
vexatious
shoestring
the
poor
fool
bent
over
it
in
reverent
ecstasy
but
zora
was
only
conscious
of
the
reddening
of
his
gills
as
he
stooped
this
to
her
was
the
charm
of
their
intercourse
that
he
never
presumed
upon
their
intimacy
when
she
remembered
the
prophecy
of
the
literary
man
from
london
she
laughed
at
it
scornfully
here
was
a
man
at
any
rate
who
regarded
her
beauty
unconcerned
and
from
whose
society
she
derived
no
emotional
experiences
she
felt
she
could
travel
safely
with
him
to
the
end
of
the
earth
this
reflection
came
to
her
one
morning
while
turner
her
maid
was
brushing
her
hair
the
corollary
followed
why
not
turner
she
said
i
soon
have
seen
enough
of
monte
carlo
i
must
go
to
paris
what
do
you
think
of
my
asking
dix
to
come
with
us
i
think
it
would
be
most
improper
said
turner
there
nothing
at
all
improper
about
it
cried
zora
with
a
flush
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
chapter
iv
at
monte
carlo
as
all
the
world
knows
there
is
an
arcade
devoted
to
the
most
humorously
expensive
lace
diamond
and
general
vanity
shops
in
the
universe
the
hôtel
métropole
and
ciro
restaurant
and
ciro
has
a
terrace
where
there
are
little
afternoon
covered
with
pink
cloths
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
save
for
a
burly
englishman
in
white
flannels
and
a
panama
hat
reading
a
magazine
by
the
door
and
zora
and
septimus
who
sat
near
the
public
gangway
the
terrace
was
deserted
inside
some
men
lounged
about
the
bar
drinking
cocktails
the
red
tzigane
orchestra
were
already
filing
into
the
restaurant
and
the
electric
lamps
were
lit
zora
and
septimus
had
just
returned
from
a
day
excursion
to
cannes
they
were
pleasantly
tired
and
lingered
over
their
tea
in
a
companionable
silence
septimus
ruminated
dreamily
over
the
nauseous
entanglement
of
a
chocolate
eclair
and
a
cigarette
while
zora
idly
watched
the
burly
englishman
presently
she
saw
him
do
an
odd
thing
he
tore
out
the
middle
of
the
magazine
it
bore
an
american
title
on
the
outside
handed
it
to
the
waiter
and
put
the
advertisement
pages
in
his
pocket
from
another
pocket
he
drew
another
magazine
and
read
the
advertisement
pages
of
that
with
concentrated
interest
her
attention
was
soon
distracted
by
a
young
couple
man
and
woman
decently
dressed
who
passed
along
the
terrace
glanced
at
her
repassed
and
looked
at
her
more
attentively
the
woman
wistfully
and
then
stopped
out
of
earshot
and
spoke
a
few
words
together
they
returned
seemed
to
hesitate
and
at
last
the
woman
taking
courage
advanced
and
addressed
her
but
madame
looks
so
kind
perhaps
will
she
pardon
the
liberty
of
my
addressing
her
zora
smiled
graciously
the
woman
was
young
fragile
careworn
and
a
piteous
appeal
lay
in
her
eyes
the
man
drew
near
and
raised
his
hat
apologetically
the
woman
continued
they
had
seen
madame
there
and
monsieur
both
looked
kind
like
all
english
people
although
she
was
french
she
was
forced
to
admit
the
superior
generosity
of
the
english
they
had
hesitated
but
the
kind
look
of
madame
had
made
her
confident
they
were
from
havre
they
had
come
to
nice
to
look
after
a
lawsuit
nearly
all
their
money
had
gone
they
had
a
little
baby
who
was
ill
in
desperation
they
had
brought
the
remainder
of
their
slender
fortune
to
monte
carlo
they
had
lost
it
it
was
foolish
but
yet
the
baby
came
out
that
day
with
nine
red
spots
on
its
chest
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
a
sign
from
the
bon
dieu
that
they
should
back
nine
and
red
at
the
tables
now
she
knew
too
late
that
it
was
measles
and
not
a
sign
from
the
bon
dieu
at
all
but
they
were
penniless
the
baby
wanted
physic
and
a
doctor
and
would
die
as
a
last
resource
they
resolved
to
sink
their
pride
and
appeal
to
the
generosity
of
monsieur
and
madame
the
woman
wistful
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
quivered
the
man
with
a
great
effort
choked
a
sob
zora
generous
heart
melted
at
the
tale
it
rang
so
stupidly
true
the
fragile
creature
air
was
so
pathetic
she
opened
her
purse
will
a
hundred
francs
be
of
any
use
to
you
she
asked
in
her
schoolgirl
french
oh
madame
and
i
too
will
give
a
hundred
to
the
baby
said
septimus
i
like
babies
and
i
also
had
the
measles
he
opened
his
pocketbook
oh
monsieur
said
the
man
how
can
i
ever
be
sufficiently
grateful
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
note
when
something
hit
him
violently
in
the
back
it
was
the
magazine
hurled
by
the
burly
englishman
who
followed
up
the
assault
by
a
torrent
of
abuse
cochons
et
plus
vite
que
ça
there
was
something
terrific
in
his
awful
british
accent
the
pair
turned
in
obvious
dismay
he
waved
them
off
do
give
them
anything
the
baby
has
any
red
spots
there
is
a
baby
they
dare
show
their
noses
in
the
rooms
je
vous
connais
vous

but
the
last
few
words
were
shouted
to
the
swiftly
retiring
backs
of
the
pathetic
couple
i
saved
you
two
hundred
francs
said
the
burly
englishman
picking
up
his
magazine
and
tenderly
smoothing
it
those
two
are
the
most
accomplished
swindlers
in
this
den
of
thieves
i
ca
believe
it
said
zora
half
hurt
half
resentful
the
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
true
said
her
champion
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
the
man
is
actually
an
accredited
agent
of
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
he
stood
his
hands
on
his
broad
hips
regarding
her
with
the
piercing
eyes
of
a
man
who
is
imparting
an
incredible
but
piece
of
information
why
the
best
of
it
asked
zora
puzzled
it
only
shows
how
unscrupulous
they
are
in
their
business
methods
a
man
like
that
could
persuade
a
fishmonger
or
an
undertaker
to
stock
it
but
he
do
them
in
the
end
they
suffer
for
it
who
will
why
jebusa
jones
of
course
oh
i
see
he
continued
looking
at
the
two
perplexed
faces
you
do
know
who
i
am
i
am
clem
sypher
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
to
see
the
impression
made
by
his
announcement
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
septimus
and
i
thank
you
for
your
services
your
name
my
name
is
dix
septimus
dix
delighted
to
meet
you
i
have
seen
you
before
two
years
ago
you
were
sitting
alone
in
the
lounge
of
the
hôtel
continental
paris
you
were
suffering
from
severe
abrasions
on
your
face
dear
me
said
septimus
i
remember
i
had
shaved
myself
with
a
safety
razor
i
invented
it
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
but
i
was
prevented
he
turned
to
zora
i
met
you
too
on
vesuvius
in
january
you
were
with
two
elderly
ladies
you
were
dreadfully
sunburnt
i
made
their
acquaintance
next
day
in
naples
you
had
gone
but
they
told
me
your
name
let
me
see
i
know
everybody
and
never
forget
anything
my
mind
is
like
my
office
do
tell
me
he
held
up
his
forefinger
and
fixed
her
with
his
eye
it
middlemist
he
cried
triumphantly
and
you
an
oriental
kind
of
christian
name
zora
am
i
right
perfectly
she
laughed
the
uncanniness
of
his
memory
mitigating
the
unconventionality
of
his
demeanor
now
we
all
know
one
another
he
said
swinging
a
chair
round
and
sitting
unasked
at
the
table
you
both
very
sunburnt
and
the
water
here
is
hard
and
will
make
the
skin
peel
you
had
better
use
some
of
the
cure
i
use
it
myself
every
day
see
the
results
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
smooth
face
which
indeed
was
as
rosy
as
a
baby
his
piercing
eyes
contrasted
oddly
with
his
chubby
full
lips
and
rounded
chin
what
cure
asked
zora
politely
what
cure
he
echoed
taken
aback
why
my
cure
what
other
cure
is
there
he
turned
to
septimus
who
stared
at
him
vacantly
then
the
incredible
truth
began
to
dawn
on
him
i
am
clem
sypher
friend
of
humanity
sypher
cure
now
do
you
know
i
afraid
i
shockingly
ignorant
said
zora
so
am
i
said
septimus
good
heavens
cried
sypher
bringing
both
hands
down
on
the
table
tragically
do
you
ever
read
your
advertisements
i
afraid
not
said
zora
no
said
septimus
before
his
look
of
mingled
amazement
and
reproach
they
felt
like
children
taken
to
task
for
having
skipped
the
kings
of
israel
well
said
sypher
this
is
the
reward
we
get
for
spending
millions
of
pounds
and
the
shrewdest
brains
in
the
country
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
have
you
ever
considered
what
anxious
thought
what
consummate
knowledge
of
human
nature
what
dearly
bought
experience
go
to
the
making
of
an
advertisement
you
go
miles
out
of
your
way
to
see
a
picture
or
a
piece
of
sculpture
that
has
cost
a
man
half
the
trouble
and
money
to
produce
and
you
not
look
at
an
advertisement
of
a
thing
vital
to
your
life
though
it
is
put
before
your
eyes
a
dozen
times
a
day
here
my
card
and
here
are
some
leaflets
for
you
to
read
at
your
leisure
they
will
repay
perusal
he
drew
an
enormous
pocketbook
from
his
breast
pocket
and
selected
two
cards
and
two
pamphlets
which
he
laid
on
the
table
then
he
arose
with
an
air
of
suave
yet
offended
dignity
zora
seeing
that
the
man
in
some
strange
way
was
deeply
hurt
looked
up
at
him
with
a
conciliatory
smile
you
must
bear
me
any
malice
sypher
because
i
so
grateful
to
you
for
saving
us
from
these
swindling
people
when
zora
smiled
into
a
man
eyes
she
was
irresistible
sypher
pink
face
relaxed
never
mind
he
said
i
send
you
all
the
advertisements
i
can
lay
my
hands
on
in
the
morning
au
revoir
he
raised
his
hat
and
went
away
zora
laughed
across
the
table
what
an
extraordinary
person
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
talking
to
a
typhoon
said
septimus
they
went
to
the
theater
that
evening
and
during
the
first
strolled
into
the
rooms
except
the
theater
the
casino
administration
provides
nothing
that
can
allure
the
visitor
from
the
only
purpose
of
the
establishment
even
the
bar
at
the
end
of
the
atrium
could
tempt
nobody
not
seriously
parched
with
thirst
it
is
the
most
comfortless
in
europe
you
are
driven
deliberately
in
desperation
into
the
rooms
zora
and
septimus
were
standing
by
the
decorous
hush
of
a
et
table
when
they
were
joined
by
clem
sypher
he
greeted
them
like
old
acquaintances
i
reckoned
i
should
meet
you
sometime
winning
we
never
play
said
zora
which
was
true
a
woman
either
plunges
feverishly
into
the
vice
of
gambling
or
she
is
kept
away
from
it
by
her
inborn
economic
sense
of
the
uses
of
money
she
can
not
regard
it
like
a
man
as
a
mere
amusement
light
loves
are
somewhat
in
the
same
category
hence
many
misunderstandings
between
the
sexes
zora
found
the
amusement
profitless
the
vice
degraded
so
after
her
first
evening
she
played
no
more
septimus
did
not
count
we
never
play
said
zora
neither
do
i
said
sypher
the
real
way
to
enjoy
monte
carlo
is
to
regard
these
rooms
as
i
wish
they
were
oh
do
say
that
sypher
exclaimed
quickly
they
are
most
useful
they
have
a
wisely
ordained
purpose
they
are
the
of
the
world
i
come
here
every
year
and
make
more
acquaintances
in
a
day
than
i
do
elsewhere
in
a
month
soon
i
shall
know
everybody
and
everybody
will
know
me
and
they
take
away
with
them
to
edinburgh
and
stockholm
and
uruguay
and
tunbridge
wells
to
all
corners
of
the
earth
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
cure
oh
i
see
from
that
point
of
view
said
zora
of
course
what
other
could
there
be
you
see
the
advantage
it
makes
the
thing
human
it
surrounds
it
with
personality
it
shows
that
of
humanity
is
a
cant
phrase
they
recommend
the
cure
to
their
friends
you
sure
it
all
right
they
are
asked
course
it
is
they
can
reply
know
the
man
clem
sypher
himself
and
the
friends
are
convinced
and
go
about
saying
they
know
a
man
who
knows
clem
sypher
and
so
the
thing
spreads
like
a
snowball
have
you
read
the
pamphlet
it
was
most
interesting
said
zora
mendaciously
i
thought
you
find
it
so
i
brought
something
in
my
pocket
for
you
he
searched
and
brought
out
a
couple
of
little
red
celluloid
boxes
which
he
handed
to
septimus
there
are
two
sample
boxes
of
the
cure
one
for
middlemist
and
one
for
yourself
dix
you
both
have
a
touch
of
the
sun
put
it
on
let
it
stay
there
for
five
minutes
then
rub
off
with
a
smooth
dry
towel
in
the
morning
you
see
the
miracle
he
looked
at
septimus
earnestly
quite
sure
you
have
anything
in
the
nature
of
an
eruption
on
you
good
lord
no
of
course
not
said
septimus
startled
out
of
a
dreamy
contemplation
of
the
two
little
red
boxes
that
a
pity
it
would
have
been
so
nice
to
cure
you
ah
said
he
with
a
keen
glance
up
the
room
there
lord
rebenham
i
must
enquire
after
his
eczema
you
wo
forget
me
now
clem
sypher
friend
of
humanity
he
bowed
and
withdrew
walking
kindly
and
trough
the
crowd
like
a
benevolent
deity
the
latest
thing
in
æsculapiuses
among
his
devotees
what
am
i
to
do
with
these
asked
septimus
holding
out
the
boxes
you
had
better
give
me
mine
or
heaven
knows
what
will
become
of
it
said
zora
and
she
put
it
in
her
little
chain
bag
with
her
handkerchief
purse
and
the
next
morning
she
received
an
enormous
basket
of
roses
and
a
bundle
of
newspapers
also
a
card
bearing
the
inscription
clem
sypher
the
kurhaus
kilburn
priory
she
frowned
ever
so
little
at
the
flowers
to
accept
them
would
be
to
accept
sypher
acquaintance
in
his
private
and
kilburn
priory
capacity
to
send
them
back
would
be
ungracious
seeing
that
he
had
saved
her
a
hundred
francs
and
had
cured
her
imaginary
sunburn
she
took
up
the
card
and
laughed
it
was
like
him
to
name
his
residence
the
kurhaus
she
would
never
know
him
in
his
private
capacity
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
one
the
roses
were
an
advertisement
so
turner
unpacked
the
basket
and
while
zora
was
putting
the
roses
into
water
she
wondered
whether
sypher
house
was
decorated
with
pictorial
advertisements
of
the
cure
instead
of
pictures
her
woman
instinct
however
caused
the
reflection
that
the
roses
must
have
cost
more
than
all
the
boxes
of
the
cure
she
could
buy
in
a
lifetime
septimus
was
dutifully
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
she
noted
that
he
was
more
spruce
than
usual
in
a
new
gray
cashmere
suit
and
that
his
brown
boots
shone
dazzlingly
like
agates
they
went
out
together
and
the
first
person
who
met
their
eyes
was
the
friend
of
humanity
sunning
himself
in
the
square
and
feeding
the
pigeons
with
bread
crumbs
from
a
paper
bag
as
soon
as
he
saw
zora
he
emptied
his
bag
and
crossed
over
good
morning
middlemist
good
morning
dix
used
the
cure
i
see
you
have
middlemist
is
it
wonderful
if
you
only

an
inscription

an
advertisement

have

done
in
diamonds
and
how
did
you

it
mr

murmured
septimus
i
forgot
about
it
last
night
and
this
morning
i
found
i
had
any
brown
boot
polish
i
used
the
cure
cried
zora
aghast
yes
said
septimus
timidly
it
rather
good
and
he
regarded
his
dazzling
boots
clem
sypher
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
clapped
septimus
on
the
shoulder
did
i
tell
you
he
cried
delightedly
did
i
tell
you
it
good
for
everything
what
cream
could
give
you
such
a
polish
by
jove
you
deserve
to
be
on
the
free
list
for
life

given
me
a
line
for
an
ad

skin

all
right

your
boots
by
george
i
use
it
this
is
a
man
with
ideas
middlemist
we
must
encourage
him
dix
is
an
inventor
said
zora
she
liked
sypher
for
laughing
it
made
him
human
it
was
therefore
with
a
touch
of
kindly
feeling
that
she
thanked
him
for
the
roses
i
wanted
to
make
them
blush
at
the
sight
of
your
complexion
after
the
cure
said
he
it
was
a
compliment
and
zora
frowned
but
it
was
a
professional
compliment
so
she
smiled
besides
the
day
was
perfect
and
zora
not
only
had
not
a
care
in
the
wide
world
but
was
conscious
of
a
becoming
hat
she
could
not
help
smiling
pleasantly
on
the
world
an
empty
motor
car
entered
the
square
and
drew
up
near
by
the
chauffeur
touched
his
cap
i
run
you
both
over
to
nice
said
clem
sypher
i

to
meet
my
agent
there
and
put
the
fear
of
god
into
him
i
sha
be
long
my
methods
are
quick
and
i
run
you
back
again
do
say
no
there
was
the
car
a
luxurious
machine
upholstered
in
green
there
was
clem
sypher
pink
and
strong
appealing
to
her
with
his
quick
eyes
there
was
the
sunshine
and
the
breathless
blue
of
the
sky
and
there
was
septimus
dix
a
faithful
bodyguard
she
wavered
and
turned
to
septimus
what
do
you
say
she
was
lost
septimus
murmured
something
inconclusive
sypher
triumphed
she
went
indoors
to
get
her
coat
and
veil
sypher
admiringly
watched
her
retreating
figure
a
poem
of
subtle
curves
and
shrugging
himself
into
his
motor
coat
which
the
chauffeur
brought
him
from
the
car
he
turned
to
septimus
look
here
dix
i
a
straight
man
and
go
straight
to
a
point
be
offended
am
i
in
the
way
not
in
the
least
said
septimus
reddening
as
for
me
i
do
care
a
hang
for
anything
in
the
universe
save
cure
that
enough
for
one
man
to
deal
with
but
i
like
having
such
a
glorious
creature
as
middlemist
in
my
car
she
attracts
attention
and
i
ca
say
but
what
i
not
proud
at
being
seen
with
her
both
as
a
man
and
a
manufacturer
but
that
all
now
tell
me
what
in
your
mind
i
do
think
i
quite
like
you
er
to
look
on
middlemist
as
an
advertisement
said
septimus
to
speak
so
directly
cost
him
considerable
effort
do
you
then
i
wo
i
love
a
man
to
speak
straight
to
me
i
respect
him
here
my
hand
he
wrung
septimus
hand
warmly
i
feel
that
we
are
going
to
be
friends
i
never
wrong
i
hope
middlemist
will
allow
me
to
be
a
friend
tell
me
about
her
septimus
again
reddened
uncomfortably
he
belonged
to
a
class
which
does
not
discuss
its
women
with
a
stranger
even
though
he
be
a
newly
sworn
brother
she
might
care
for
it
he
said
sypher
once
more
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
good
again
he
cried
admiringly
i
should
like
you
half
so
much
if
you
had
told
me
i
got
to
know
for
i
know
everything
so
i
ask
her
myself
zora
came
down
coated
and
veiled
her
face
radiant
as
a
romney
in
its
frame
of
gauze
she
looked
so
big
and
beautiful
and
sypher
looked
so
big
and
strong
and
both
seemed
so
full
of
vitality
that
septimus
felt
criminally
insignificant
his
voice
was
of
too
low
a
pitch
to
make
itself
carry
when
these
two
spoke
in
their
full
tones
he
shrank
into
his
shell
had
he
not
realized
in
his
sensitive
way
that
without
him
as
a
watchdog
ineffectual
spaniel
that
he
was
zora
would
not
accept
clem
sypher
invitation
he
would
have
excused
himself
from
the
drive
he
differentiated
not
conceitedly
between
clem
sypher
and
himself
she
had
driven
alone
with
him
on
her
first
night
at
monte
carlo
but
then
she
had
carried
him
off
between
her
finger
and
thumb
so
to
speak
as
the
brobdingnagian
ladies
carried
off
gulliver
he
knew
that
he
did
not
count
as
a
danger
in
the
eyes
of
young
women
a
man
like
sypher
did
he
knew
that
zora
would
not
have
driven
alone
with
sypher
any
more
than
with
the
wretch
of
the
evil
eyes
he
did
not
analyze
this
out
himself
as
his
habit
of
mind
was
too
vague
and
dreamy
but
he
knew
it
instinctively
as
a
dog
knows
whom
he
can
trust
with
his
mistress
and
whom
he
can
not
so
when
sypher
and
zora
with
a
great
bustle
of
life
were
discussing
seating
arrangements
in
the
car
he
climbed
modestly
into
the
front
seat
next
to
the
chauffeur
and
would
not
be
dislodged
by
sypher
entreaties
he
was
just
there
on
guard
having
no
place
in
the
vigorous
atmosphere
of
their
personalities
he
sat
aloof
smoking
his
pipe
and
wondering
whether
he
could
invent
a
motor
perambulator
which
could
run
on
rails
round
a
small
garden
fill
the
lungs
with
air
and
save
the
british
army
from
the
temptation
of
his
sporadic
discourse
on
the
subject
perplexed
the
chauffeur
it
was
a
day
of
vivid
glory
rain
had
fallen
heavily
during
the
night
laying
the
dust
on
the
road
and
washing
to
gay
freshness
the
leaves
of
palms
and
orange
trees
and
the
purple
bourgainvillea
and
other
flowers
that
rioted
on
wayside
walls
all
the
deep
strong
color
of
the
south
was
there
making
things
unreal
the
gray
mountains
fragile
masses
against
the
solid
cobalt
of
the
sky
the
mediterranean
met
the
horizon
in
a
blue
so
intense
that
the
soul
ached
to
see
it
the
heart
of
spring
throbbed
in
the
deep
bosom
of
summer
the
air
as
they
sped
through
it
was
like
cool
spiced
wine
zora
listened
to
clem
sypher
dithyrambics
the
wine
of
the
air
had
got
into
his
head
he
spoke
as
she
had
heard
no
man
speak
before
the
turns
of
the
road
brought
into
sight
view
after
magic
view
causing
her
to
catch
her
breath
purple
rock
laughing
in
the
sea
townlets
flashing
white
against
the
mountain
flank
gardens
of
paradise
yet
clem
sypher
sang
of
his
cure
first
it
was
a
salve
for
all
external
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
it
spared
humanity
its
heritage
of
epidermatous
suffering
it
could
not
fail
he
reeled
off
the
string
of
hideous
diseases
with
a
lyrical
lilt
it
was
his
own
discovery
an
obscure
chemist
assistant
in
bury
edmunds
he
had
by
dint
of
experiments
hit
on
this
remedy
when
i
found
what
it
was
that
i
had
done
middlemist
said
he
solemnly
i
passed
my
vigil
like
a
knight
of
old
in
my
dispensary
with
a
pot
of
the
cure
in
front
of
me
and
i
took
a
great
oath
to
devote
my
life
to
spread
it
far
and
wide
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
it
should
bring
comfort
i
swore
to
the
king
in
his
palace
and
the
peasant
in
his
hut
it
should
be
a
household
word
in
the
london
slum
and
on
the
tartar
steppe
sypher
cure
could
go
with
the
red
cross
into
battle
and
should
be
in
the
clerk
wife
cupboard
in
peckham
rye
the
human
chamois
that
climbs
the
alps
the
gentle
lunatic
that
plays
golf
the
idiot
that
goes
and
gets
scalped
by
red
indians
the
missionary
that
gets
half
roasted
by
cannibals
if
he
gets
quite
roasted
the
cure
no
good
it
ca
do
impossibilities
all
should
carry
sypher
cure
in
their
waistcoat
pockets
all
mankind
should
know
it
from
china
to
peru
from
cape
horn
to
nova
zembla
it
would
free
the
tortured
world
from
plague
i
would
be
the
friend
of
humanity
i
took
that
for
my
device
it
was
something
to
live
for
i
was
twenty
then
i
am
forty
now
i
have
had
twenty
years
of
the
fiercest
battle
that
ever
man
fought
and
surely
you
come
off
victorious
sypher
said
zora
i
shall
never
be
victorious
until
it
has
overspread
the
earth
he
declared
and
he
passed
one
hand
over
the
other
in
a
gesture
which
symbolized
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
coating
of
sypher
cure
why
should
it
it
shall
somehow
i
believe
that
with
you
on
my
side
it
will
i
zora
started
away
to
the
corner
of
the
car
and
gazed
on
him
in
blank
amazement
i
what
in
the
world
have
i
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
yet
said
sypher
i
have
an
intuition
i
a
believer
in
intuitions
i
followed
them
all
my
life
and
they
never
played
me
false
the
moment
i
learned
that
you
had
never
heard
of
me
i
felt
it
zora
breathed
comfortably
again
it
was
not
an
implied
declaration
i
fighting
against
the
powers
of
darkness
he
continued
i
once
read
a
bit
of
spenser
queene
there
was
a
red
cross
knight
who
slew
a
dragon
but
he
had
a
fabulous
kind
of
woman
behind
him
when
i
saw
you
you
seemed
that
fabulous
kind
of
woman
at
a
sharp
wall
corner
a
clump
of
tall
poinsettias
flamed
against
the
sky
zora
laughed
here
we
are
in
the
middle
of
a
fairy
tale
what
are
the
powers
of
darkness
in
your
case
sir
red
cross
knight
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
said
sypher
savagely
chapter
v
that
was
clem
sypher
dragon
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
he
drew
so
vivid
a
picture
of
its
foul
iniquity
that
zora
was
convinced
that
the
earth
had
never
harbored
so
scaly
a
horror
of
all
powers
of
evil
in
the
universe
it
was
the
most
devastating
she
was
swept
up
by
his
eloquence
to
his
point
of
view
and
saw
things
with
his
eyes
when
she
came
to
examine
the
poor
dragon
in
the
cool
light
of
her
own
reason
it
appeared
at
the
worst
to
be
but
a
pushful
patent
medicine
of
an
inferior
order
which
on
account
of
its
cheapness
and
the
superior
american
skill
in
distributing
it
was
threatening
to
drive
sypher
cure
off
the
market
i
strangle
it
as
hercules
strangled
the
thing
cried
sypher
he
meant
the
hydra
which
was
and
which
hercules
strangle
but
a
man
can
be
at
once
unmythological
and
sincere
clem
sypher
was
in
earnest
you
talk
as
if
your
cure
had
something
of
a
divine
sanction
said
zora
this
was
before
her
conversion
middlemist
if
i
did
believe
that
said
sypher
solemnly
do
you
think
i
would
have
devoted
my
life
to
it
i
thought
people
ran
these
things
to
make
money
said
zora
it
was
then
that
sypher
entered
on
the
exordium
of
the
speech
which
convinced
her
of
the
diabolical
noisomeness
of
the
jebusa
jones
unguent
his
peroration
summed
up
the
contest
as
that
between
mithra
and
ahriman
yet
zora
though
she
took
a
woman
personal
interest
in
the
battle
between
sypher
cure
and
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
siding
loyally
and
with
her
astonishing
host
failed
to
pierce
to
the
spirituality
of
the
man
to
divine
him
as
a
poet
with
an
ideal
after
all
said
sypher
on
the
way
back
septimus
with
his
turned
up
over
his
ears
still
sat
on
guard
by
the
chauffeur
consoled
by
a
happy
hour
he
had
spent
alone
with
his
mistress
after
lunch
while
sypher
was
away
putting
the
fear
of
god
into
his
agent
during
which
hour
he
had
unfolded
to
her
his
scientific
philosophy
of
perambulators
after
all
said
sypher
the
great
thing
is
to
have
a
purpose
in
life
everyone
have
my
purpose
he
apologized
for
humanity
but
they
can
have
some
guiding
principle
what
yours
zora
was
startled
by
the
unexpected
question
what
was
her
purpose
in
life
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
color
of
the
world
that
was
rather
vague
also
nonsensical
when
so
formulated
she
took
refuge
in
jest
i
thought
you
had
decided
that
my
mission
was
to
help
you
slay
the
dragon
we
have
to
decide
on
our
missions
for
ourselves
said
he
do
you
think
it
sufficient
purpose
for
a
woman
who
has
been
in
a
gray
prison
all
her
life
when
she
finds
herself
free
to
go
out
and
see
all
that
is
wonderful
in
scenery
like
this
in
paintings
architecture
manners
and
customs
of
other
nations
in
people
who
have
other
ideas
and
feelings
from
those
she
knew
in
prison
you
speak
as
if
you
finding
fault
with
me
for
not
doing
anything
useful
is
what
i
do
enough
what
else
can
i
do
i
do
know
said
sypher
looking
at
the
back
of
his
gloves
then
he
turned
his
head
and
met
her
eyes
in
one
of
his
quick
glances
but
you
with
your
color
and
your
build
and
your
voice
seem
somehow
to
me
to
stand
for
force
there
something
big
about
you
just
as
there
something
big
about
me
napoleonic
and
i
ca
understand
why
it
does
act
in
some
particular
direction
oh
you
must
give
me
time
cried
zora
time
to
expand
to
find
out
what
kind
of
creature
i
really
am
i
tell
you
i
been
in
prison
then
i
thought
i
was
free
and
found
a
purpose
as
you
call
it
then
i
had
a
blow
i
am
a
widow
i
supposed
you
guessed
oh
now
speak
it
was
grief
my
married
life
was
a
misery
i
forget
it
i
went
away
from
home
free
five
months
ago
to
see
all
this
she
waved
her
hand
for
the
first
time
whatever
force
i
have
has
been
devoted
to
seeing
it
all
to
taking
it
all
in
she
spoke
earnestly
just
a
bit
passionately
in
the
silence
that
followed
she
realized
with
sudden
amazement
that
she
had
opened
her
heart
to
this
prime
apostle
of
quackery
as
he
made
no
immediate
reply
the
silence
grew
tense
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tight
and
wondered
as
her
sex
has
done
from
time
immemorial
why
on
earth
she
had
spoken
when
he
answered
it
was
kindly
you
done
me
a
great
honor
in
telling
me
this
i
understand
you
want
the
earth
or
as
much
of
it
as
you
can
get
and
when
you
got
it
and
found
out
what
it
means
you
make
a
great
use
of
it
have
you
many
friends
no
said
zora
he
had
an
uncanny
way
of
throwing
her
back
on
to
essentials
none
stronger
than
myself
will
you
take
me
as
a
friend
i
strong
enough
said
sypher
willingly
she
said
dominated
by
his
earnestness
that
good
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
when
you
found
your
vocation
i
can
tell
you
at
any
rate
how
to
get
to
what
you
want
you
just
got
to
keep
a
thing
in
view
and
go
for
it
and
never
let
your
eyes
wander
to
right
or
left
or
up
or
down
and
looking
back
is
fatal
the
truest
thing
in
scripture
is
about
lot
wife
she
looked
back
and
was
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
he
paused
his
face
assumed
an
air
of
profound
reflection
and
he
added
with
gravity
and
the
clem
sypher
of
the
period
when
he
came
by
made
use
of
her
and
plastered
her
over
with
posters
of
his
cure
the
day
she
had
appointed
as
the
end
of
her
monte
carlo
visit
arrived
she
would
first
go
to
paris
where
some
americans
whom
she
had
met
in
florence
and
with
whom
she
had
exchanged
occasional
postcards
pressed
her
to
join
them
then
london
and
then
a
spell
of
rest
in
the
lavender
of
nunsmere
that
was
her
programme
septimus
dix
was
to
escort
her
as
far
as
paris
in
defiance
of
the
proprieties
as
interpreted
by
turner
what
was
to
become
of
him
afterwards
neither
conjectured
least
of
all
septimus
himself
he
said
nothing
about
getting
back
to
shepherd
bush
many
brilliant
ideas
had
occurred
to
him
during
his
absence
which
needed
careful
working
out
wherefore
zora
concluded
that
he
proposed
to
accompany
her
to
london
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
train
started
she
dispatched
turner
to
septimus
hotel
to
remind
him
of
the
journey
turner
a
woman
of
forty
like
the
oyster
she
had
been
crossed
in
love
and
like
her
mistress
she
held
men
in
high
contempt
returned
with
an
indignant
tale
after
a
series
of
parleyings
with
dix
through
the
medium
of
the
hotel
who
had
a
confused
comprehension
of
voluble
english
she
had
mounted
at
dix
entreaty
to
his
room
there
she
found
him
half
clad
and
in
his
staring
helplessly
at
a
wilderness
of
clothing
and
toilet
articles
for
which
there
was
no
space
in
his
suit
cases
and
bag
already
piled
mountain
high
i
can
never
do
it
turner
he
said
as
she
entered
what
to
be
done
turner
replied
that
she
did
not
know
her
mistress
instructions
were
that
he
should
catch
the
train
i
have
to
leave
behind
what
i
ca
get
in
he
said
despondently
i
generally
have
to
do
so
i
tell
the
hotel
people
to
give
it
to
widows
and
orphans
but
that
one
of
the
things
that
make
traveling
so
expensive
but
you
brought
everything
sir
in
this
luggage
i
suppose
so
wiggleswick
packed
it
his
professional
training
turner
i
think
they
call
it
the
swag
as
turner
had
not
heard
of
wiggleswick
profession
she
did
not
catch
the
allusion
nor
did
zora
enlighten
her
when
she
reported
the
conversation
if
they
went
in
once
they
go
in
again
said
turner
they
wo
they
never
do
said
septimus
his
plight
was
so
hopeless
he
seemed
so
immeasurably
her
sex
inferior
that
he
awoke
her
contemptuous
pity
besides
her
trained
woman
hands
itched
to
restore
order
out
of
masculine
chaos
turn
everything
out
and
i
pack
for
you
she
said
resolutely
regardless
of
the
proprieties
on
further
investigation
she
held
out
horrified
hands
he
had
mixed
up
shirts
with
shoes
his
clothes
were
rolled
in
bundles
his
collars
embraced
his
sponge
his
trees
divorced
from
boots
lay
on
the
top
of
an
unprotected
bottle
of
he
had
tried
to
fit
his
brushes
against
a
box
of
and
the
top
had
already
come
off
turner
shook
out
his
dress
suit
and
discovered
a
couple
of
hotel
towels
which
had
got
mysteriously
hidden
in
the
folds
she
held
them
up
severely
no
wonder
you
ca
get
your
things
in
if
you
take
away
half
the
hotel
linen
and
she
threw
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
in
twenty
minutes
she
had
worked
the
magic
of
wiggleswick
septimus
was
humbly
grateful
if
i
were
you
sir
she
said
i
go
to
the
station
at
once
and
sit
on
my
boxes
till
my
mistress
arrives
i
think
i
do
it
turner
said
septimus
turner
went
back
to
zora
flushed
triumphant
and
indignant
if
you
think
said
she
that
dix
is
going
to
help
us
on
our
journey
you
very
much
mistaken
he
lose
his
ticket
and
he
lose
his
luggage
and
he
lose
himself
and
we
have
to
go
and
find
them
you
must
take
dix
humorously
said
zora
i
no
desire
to
take
him
at
all
and
turner
snorted
virtuously
as
became
her
station
zora
found
him
humbly
awaiting
her
on
the
platform
in
company
with
clem
sypher
who
presented
her
with
a
great
bunch
of
roses
and
a
bundle
of
illustrated
papers
septimus
had
received
as
a
parting
guerdon
an
enormous
package
of
the
cure
which
he
embraced
somewhat
dejectedly
it
was
sypher
who
looked
after
the
luggage
of
the
party
his
terrific
accent
filled
the
station
septimus
regarded
him
with
envy
he
wondered
how
a
man
dared
order
foreign
railway
officials
about
like
that
if
i
tried
to
do
it
they
would
lock
me
up
i
once
interfered
in
a
street
row
zora
did
not
hear
the
dire
results
of
the
interference
sypher
claimed
her
attention
until
the
train
was
on
the
point
of
starting
your
address
in
england
you
have
given
it
the
nook
nunsmere
surrey
will
always
find
me
nunsmere
he
paused
pencil
in
hand
and
looked
up
at
her
as
she
stood
framed
in
the
railway
carriage
window
i
nearly
bought
a
house
there
last
year
i
was
looking
out
for
one
with
a
lawn
reaching
down
to
a
main
railway
track
this
one
had
it
penton
court
yes
that
was
the
name
it
still
unsold
laughed
zora
idly
i
buy
it
at
once
said
he
en
cried
the
guard
sypher
put
out
his
masterful
hand
au
revoir
remember
we
are
friends
i
never
say
what
i
do
mean
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
zora
took
her
seat
opposite
septimus
i
really
believe
he
do
it
she
said
what
oh
something
crazy
said
zora
tell
me
about
the
street
row
in
paris
zora
was
caught
in
the
arms
of
the
normal
and
the
uneventful
an
american
family
consisting
of
a
father
mother
son
and
two
daughters
touring
the
continent
do
not
generate
an
atmosphere
of
adventure
their
name
was
callender
they
were
wealthy
and
the
track
beaten
by
the
golden
feet
of
their
predecessors
was
good
enough
for
them
they
were
generous
and
kindly
there
was
no
subtle
complexity
in
their
tastes
they
liked
the
best
they
paid
for
it
and
they
got
it
the
women
were
charming
cultivated
and
eager
for
new
sensations
they
found
zora
a
new
sensation
because
she
had
that
range
of
half
tones
which
is
the
heritage
of
a
child
of
an
older
grayer
civilization
father
and
son
delighted
in
her
most
men
did
besides
she
relieved
the
family
tedium
the
family
knew
the
paris
of
the
rich
and
other
rich
in
paris
zora
accompanied
them
on
their
rounds
they
lunched
and
dined
in
the
latest
expensive
restaurants
in
the
champs
elysées
and
the
bois
they
went
to
races
they
walked
up
and
down
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
the
avenue
de
and
visited
many
establishments
where
the
female
person
is
adorned
after
the
theater
they
drove
to
the
cabarets
of
montmartre
where
they
met
other
americans
and
english
and
felt
comfortably
certain
that
they
were
seeing
the
naughty
shocking
underside
of
paris
they
also
went
to
the
louvre
and
to
the
tomb
of
napoleon
they
stayed
at
the
grand
hotel
zora
saw
little
of
septimus
he
knew
paris
in
a
queer
dim
way
of
his
own
and
lived
in
an
obscure
hotel
whose
name
zora
could
not
remember
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
she
introduced
him
to
the
callenders
and
they
were
quite
prepared
to
receive
him
into
their
corporation
but
he
shrank
from
so
vast
a
concourse
as
six
human
beings
he
seemed
to
be
overawed
by
the
multitude
of
voices
unnerved
by
the
multiplicity
of
personalities
the
unfeathered
owl
blinked
dazedly
in
general
society
as
the
feathered
one
does
in
daylight
at
first
he
tried
to
stand
the
glare
for
zora
sake
come
out
and
mix
with
people
and
enjoy
yourself
cried
zora
when
he
was
arguing
against
a
proposal
to
join
the
party
on
a
versailles
excursion
i
want
you
to
enjoy
yourself
for
once
in
your
life
besides
you
always
so
anxious
to
be
human
this
will
make
you
human
do
you
think
it
will
he
asked
seriously
if
you
do
i
come
but
at
versailles
they
lost
him
and
the
party
as
a
party
knew
him
no
more
what
he
did
with
himself
in
paris
zora
could
not
imagine
a
cambridge
acquaintance
one
of
the
men
on
his
staircase
who
had
not
yet
terminated
his
disastrous
career
ran
across
him
in
the
boulevard
sévastopol
why
if
it
is
the
owl
what
are
you
doing
oh
hooting
said
septimus
which
was
more
information
as
to
his
activities
than
he
vouchsafed
to
give
zora
once
he
murmured
something
about
a
friend
whom
he
saw
occasionally
when
she
asked
him
where
his
friend
lived
he
waved
an
indeterminate
hand
eastwards
and
said
there
it
was
a
friend
thought
zora
of
whom
he
had
no
reason
to
be
proud
for
he
prevented
further
questioning
by
adroitly
changing
the
conversation
to
the
price
of
hams
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
hams
nothing
said
septimus
but
when
i
see
hams
hanging
up
in
a
shop
i
always
want
to
buy
them
they
look
so
shiny
zora
delicate
nostrils
sniffed
the
faintest
perfume
of
a
mystery
but
a
moment
afterwards
the
callenders
carried
her
off
to
ledoyen
and
longchamps
and
other
indubitable
actualities
in
which
she
forgot
things
less
tangible
long
afterwards
she
discovered
that
the
friend
was
an
old
woman
a
des
quatre
who
sold
vegetables
in
the
place
de
la
république
he
had
known
her
many
years
and
as
she
was
at
the
point
of
death
he
comforted
her
with
and
flowers
and
hams
and
the
ministrations
of
an
indignant
physician
but
at
the
time
septimus
hid
his
good
samaritanism
under
a
cloud
of
vagueness
then
came
a
period
during
which
zora
lost
him
altogether
days
passed
she
missed
him
life
with
the
callenders
was
a
continuous
shooting
of
rapids
a
quiet
talk
with
septimus
was
an
hour
in
a
backwater
curiously
restful
she
began
to
worry
had
he
been
run
over
by
an
omnibus
only
an
miracle
could
bring
him
safely
across
the
streets
of
a
great
city
when
the
callenders
took
her
to
the
morgue
she
dreaded
to
look
at
the
corpses
i
do
wish
i
knew
what
has
become
of
him
she
said
to
turner
why
not
write
to
him
turner
suggested
i
forgotten
the
name
of
his
hotel
said
zora
wrinkling
her
forehead
the
name
of
the
hôtel
quincamboeuf
where
he
lodged
eluded
her
memory
i
do
wish
i
knew
she
repeated
then
she
caught
an
involuntary
but
illuminating
gleam
in
turner
eye
and
she
bade
her
look
for
hairpins
inwardly
she
gasped
from
the
shock
of
revelation
then
she
laughed
to
herself
half
amused
half
indignant
the
preposterous
absurdity
of
the
suggestion
but
in
her
heart
she
realized
that
in
some
undefined
human
fashion
septimus
dix
counted
for
something
in
her
life
what
had
become
of
him
at
last
she
found
him
one
morning
sitting
by
a
table
in
the
courtyard
of
the
grand
hotel
patiently
awaiting
her
descent
by
mere
chance
she
was
why
what
the
intended
reproval
died
on
her
lips
as
she
saw
his
face
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
white
his
eyes
sunken
the
man
was
his
hand
burned
through
her
glove
feelings
warm
and
new
gushed
forth
oh
my
friend
what
is
the
matter
i
must
go
back
to
england
i
came
to
say
i
had
this
from
wiggleswick
he
handed
her
an
open
letter
she
waved
it
away
that
of
no
consequence
sit
down
you
you
have
a
high
temperature
you
should
be
in
bed
i
been
said
septimus
four
days
and
you
got
up
in
this
state
you
must
go
back
at
once
have
you
seen
a
doctor
no
of
course
you
have
oh
dear
she
wrung
her
hands
you
are
not
fit
to
be
trusted
alone
i
drive
you
to
your
hotel
and
see
that
you
comfortable
and
send
for
a
doctor
i
left
the
hotel
said
septimus
i
going
to
catch
the
eleven
train
my
luggage
is
on
that
cab
but
it
five
minutes
past
eleven
now
you
have
lost
the
train
thank
goodness
i
be
in
good
time
for
the
four
said
septimus
this
is
the
way
i
generally
travel
i
told
you
he
rose
swayed
a
bit
and
put
his
hand
on
the
table
to
steady
himself
i
go
and
wait
at
the
station
then
i
be
sure
to
catch
it
you
see
i
must
go
but
why
cried
zora
wiggleswick
letter
the
house
has
been
burnt
down
and
everything
in
it
the
only
thing
he
saved
was
a
large
portrait
of
queen
victoria
then
he
fainted
zora
had
him
carried
to
a
room
in
the
hotel
and
sent
for
a
doctor
who
kept
him
in
bed
for
a
fortnight
zora
and
turner
nursed
him
much
to
his
apologetic
content
the
callenders
in
the
meanwhile
went
to
berlin
when
septimus
got
up
gaunt
and
staring
he
appealed
to
the
beholder
as
the
most
helpless
thing
which
the
creator
had
clothed
in
the
semblance
of
a
man
he
must
take
very
great
care
of
himself
for
the
next
few
weeks
said
the
doctor
if
he
gets
a
relapse
i
wo
answer
for
the
consequences
you
take
him
somewhere
take
him
somewhere
the
idea
had
been
worrying
her
for
some
days
past
if
she
left
him
to
his
own
initiative
he
would
probably
go
and
camp
with
wiggleswick
amid
the
ruins
of
his
house
in
shepherd
bush
where
he
would
fall
ill
again
and
die
she
would
be
responsible
we
ca
leave
him
here
at
any
rate
she
remarked
to
turner
turner
agreed
as
well
abandon
a
baby
on
a
doorstep
and
expect
it
to
earn
its
livelihood
she
also
had
come
to
take
a
proprietary
interest
in
septimus
he
might
stay
with
us
in
nunsmere
what
do
you
think
turner
i
think
said
turner
that
would
be
the
least
improper
arrangement
he
can
have
cousin
jane
room
mused
zora
knowing
that
cousin
jane
would
fly
at
her
approach
and
i
see
that
he
comes
down
to
his
meals
regular
said
turner
then
it
settled
said
zora
she
went
forthwith
to
the
invalid
and
acquainted
him
with
his
immediate
destiny
at
first
he
resisted
he
would
be
a
nuisance
since
his
boyhood
he
had
never
lived
in
a
lady
house
even
landladies
in
lodgings
had
found
him
impossible
he
could
not
think
of
accepting
more
favors
from
her
all
too
gracious
hands
you
got
to
do
what
you
told
said
zora
conclusively
she
noticed
a
shade
of
anxiety
cross
his
face
is
there
anything
else
wiggleswick
i
do
know
what
to
become
of
him
he
can
come
to
nunsmere
and
lodge
with
the
local
policeman
said
zora
on
the
evening
before
they
started
from
paris
she
received
a
letter
addressed
in
a
curiously
feminine
hand
it
ran
dear
middlemist
i
do
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
i
have
bought
penton
court
i
have
also
started
a
campaign
which
will
wipe
the
jebusa
jones
people
off
the
face
of
the
earth
they
blacken
i
hope
you
are
finding
a
vocation
when
i
am
settled
at
nunsmere
we
must
talk
further
of
this
i
take
a
greater
interest
in
you
than
in
any
other
woman
i
have
ever
known
and
that
i
believe
you
take
an
interest
in
me
is
the
proud
privilege
of
yours
very
faithfully
clem
sypher
here
are
the
three
railway
tickets
said
turner
who
had
brought
up
the
letter
i
think
we
had
better
take
charge
of
them
zora
laughed
and
when
turner
had
left
the
room
she
laughed
again
clem
sypher
letter
and
septimus
ticket
lay
side
by
side
on
her
and
they
appealed
to
her
sense
of
humor
they
represented
the
net
result
of
her
misanthropic
travels
what
would
her
mother
say
what
would
emmy
say
what
would
be
the
superior
remark
of
the
literary
man
from
london
she
zora
middlemist
who
had
announced
in
the
market
place
with
such
a
flourish
of
trumpets
that
she
was
starting
on
her
glorious
pilgrimage
to
the
heart
of
life
abjuring
all
conversation
with
the
execrated
male
sex
to
have
this
ironical
adventure
it
was
deliciously
funny
not
only
had
she
found
two
men
in
the
heart
of
life
but
she
was
bringing
them
back
with
her
to
nunsmere
she
could
not
hide
them
from
the
world
in
the
secrecy
of
her
own
memory
there
they
were
in
actual
bodily
presence
the
sole
trophies
of
her
quest
yet
she
put
a
postscript
to
a
letter
to
her
mother
i
know
in
your
dear
romantic
way
you
will
declare
that
these
two
men
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
you
be
wrong
if
they
had
have
anything
to
do
with
them
it
would
have
made
them
quite
the
energy
with
which
she
licked
and
closed
the
envelope
was
remarkable
but
unnecessary
chapter
vi
things
happen
slowly
at
nunsmere
from
the
grasping
of
an
idea
to
the
pace
of
the
church
choir
over
the
hymns
life
there
is
no
vulgar
tearing
as
it
is
in
godalming
london
and
other
vortices
of
human
passions
but
the
stately
measure
of
a
minuet
delights
are
deliberate
and
have
lingering
ends
a
hen
would
scorn
to
hatch
a
chicken
with
the
indecent
haste
of
her
sister
in
the
next
parish
six
months
passed
and
zora
wondered
what
had
become
of
them
only
a
few
visits
to
london
where
she
had
consorted
somewhat
gaily
with
acquaintances
had
marked
their
flight
and
the
gentle
fingers
of
nunsmere
had
graduated
the
reawakening
of
her
nostalgia
for
the
great
world
she
spoke
now
and
then
of
visiting
japan
and
america
and
south
africa
somewhat
to
her
mother
consternation
but
no
irresistible
force
drove
her
thither
she
found
contentment
in
procrastination
it
had
also
been
a
mild
amusement
to
settle
septimus
dix
after
his
recovery
in
a
little
house
facing
the
common
he
had
to
inhabit
some
portion
of
this
planet
and
as
he
had
no
choice
of
spot
save
hackney
downs
which
wiggleswick
suggested
zora
waved
her
hand
to
the
tenantless
house
and
told
him
to
take
it
as
there
was
an
outhouse
at
the
end
of
the
garden
which
he
could
use
as
a
workshop
his
principal
desideratum
in
a
residence
he
obeyed
her
readily
she
then
bought
his
furniture
plate
and
linen
and
a
complicated
kitchen
battery
over
whose
uses
wiggleswick
scratched
a
bewildered
head
a
saucepan
i
know
and
a
i
know
but
what
you
to
put
in
those
things
with
holes
in
them
fairly
licks
me
perhaps
we
might
grow
geraniums
in
them
said
septimus
brightly
alter
a
fit
of
musing
if
you
do
said
zora
i
put
a
female
cook
in
charge
of
you
both
and
wash
my
hands
of
you
whereupon
she
explained
the
uses
of
a
cullender
and
gave
wiggleswick
to
understand
that
she
was
a
woman
of
her
word
and
that
an
undrained
cabbage
would
be
the
signal
for
the
execution
of
her
threat
from
the
first
she
had
assumed
despotic
power
over
wiggleswick
of
whose
influence
with
his
master
she
had
been
absurdly
jealous
but
wiggleswick
bent
hoary
deaf
crabbed
evil
old
ruffian
that
he
was
like
most
instinctively
obeyed
the
word
of
command
and
meekly
accepted
zora
as
his
taskmistress
for
septimus
began
happy
days
wherein
the
clock
was
disregarded
the
vague
projects
that
had
filled
his
head
for
the
construction
of
a
new
type
of
gun
took
definite
shape
some
queer
corner
of
his
brain
had
assimilated
a
marvelous
knowledge
of
field
artillery
and
zora
was
amazed
at
the
extent
of
his
technical
library
which
wiggleswick
had
overlooked
in
his
statement
of
the
salvage
from
the
house
at
shepherd
bush
now
and
then
he
would
creep
from
the
shyness
which
enveloped
the
inventive
side
of
his
nature
and
would
talk
with
her
with
unintelligible
earnestness
of
these
dreadful
engines
of
radial
and
initial
hoop
pressures
of
drift
angles
of
ballistics
of
longitudinal
tensions
and
would
jot
down
trigonometrical
formulae
illustrated
by
diagrams
until
her
brain
reeled
or
of
his
treatise
on
guns
of
large
caliber
just
written
and
now
in
the
printers
hands
and
of
the
revolution
in
warfare
these
astounding
machines
would
effect
his
eyes
would
lose
their
dreamy
haze
and
would
become
luminous
his
nervous
fingers
would
become
effectual
the
man
would
become
transfigured
but
as
soon
as
the
fervid
fit
passed
off
he
would
turn
with
amiable
aimlessness
to
his
usual
irrelevance
sometimes
he
would
work
all
night
either
in
his
room
or
his
workshop
at
his
inventions
sometimes
he
would
dream
for
days
together
there
was
an
pond
in
the
middle
of
the
common
with
rough
benches
placed
here
and
there
at
the
brink
septimus
loved
to
sit
on
one
of
them
and
look
at
the
ducks
he
said
he
was
fascinated
by
the
way
they
wagged
their
tails
it
suggested
an
invention
of
what
nature
he
could
not
yet
determine
he
also
formed
a
brotherly
intimacy
with
a
lame
donkey
belonging
to
the
sexton
and
used
to
feed
him
with
de
foie
sandwiches
specially
prepared
by
wiggleswick
until
he
was
authoritatively
informed
that
raw
carrots
would
be
more
acceptable
to
see
the
two
of
them
side
by
side
watching
the
ducks
in
the
pond
wag
their
tails
was
a
touching
spectacle
another
amenity
in
septimus
peaceful
existence
was
emmy
being
at
this
time
out
of
an
engagement
she
paid
various
flying
visits
to
nunsmere
bringing
with
her
an
echo
of
comic
opera
and
an
odor
of
she
dawned
on
septimus
horizon
like
a
mischievous
and
impertinent
planet
so
different
from
zora
the
great
fixed
star
of
his
heaven
yet
so
pretty
so
twinkling
so
artlessly
and
so
obviously
revolving
round
some
sun
of
her
own
that
he
took
her
with
wiggleswick
the
ducks
and
the
donkey
into
his
close
comradeship
it
was
she
who
had
ordained
the
carrots
she
had
hair
like
golden
thistledown
and
the
dainty
blonde
skin
that
betrays
every
motion
of
the
blood
she
could
blush
like
the
pink
of
an
english
garden
she
could
blanch
to
the
whiteness
of
alabaster
her
eyes
were
after
rain
her
mouth
was
made
for
pretty
slang
and
kisses
neither
her
features
nor
her
most
often
photographed
expression
showed
the
tiniest
scrap
of
what
the
austere
of
her
sex
used
to
call
character
when
the
world
smiled
on
her
she
laughed
when
it
frowned
she
cried
when
she
met
septimus
dix
she
flew
to
him
as
a
child
does
to
a
new
toy
and
spent
gorgeous
hours
in
pulling
him
to
pieces
to
see
how
he
worked
why
are
you
married
she
asked
him
one
day
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
they
were
on
the
common
an
autumn
stretch
of
pearls
and
purples
with
here
and
there
a
streak
of
wistful
blue
as
if
seeking
the
inspiration
of
a
reason
because
no
one
has
married
me
he
replied
emmy
laughed
that
just
like
you
you
expect
a
woman
to
drag
you
out
of
your
house
by
the
scruff
of
your
neck
and
haul
you
to
church
without
your
so
much
as
asking
her
i
heard
that
lots
of
women
do
said
septimus
emmy
looked
at
him
sharply
every
woman
resents
a
universal
criticism
of
her
sex
but
can
not
help
feeling
a
twinge
of
respect
for
the
critic
she
took
refuge
in
scorn
a
real
man
goes
out
and
looks
for
a
wife
but
suppose
he
does
want
one
he
must
want
a
woman
to
love
what
can
his
life
be
without
a
woman
in
it
what
can
anybody
life
be
without
some
one
to
care
for
i
really
believe
you
made
of
sawdust
why
do
you
fall
in
love
septimus
took
off
his
hat
ran
his
fingers
through
his
upstanding
hair
his
head
and
looked
at
her
helplessly
oh
no
i
booked
it
no
use
your
falling
in
love
with
me
i
would
presume
to
do
such
a
thing
he
stammered
somewhat
scared
i
think
love
is
serious
it
like
an
invention
sometimes
it
lies
deep
down
inside
you
great
and
quiet
and
at
other
times
it
racks
you
and
keeps
you
from
sleeping
oho
cried
emmy
so
you
know
all
about
it
you
in
love
now
tell
me
who
is
she
it
was
many
years
ago
said
septimus
she
wore
pigtails
and
i
burned
a
hole
in
her
pinafore
with
a
toy
cannon
and
she
slapped
my
face
afterwards
she
married
a
butcher
he
looked
at
her
with
his
wan
smile
and
again
raised
his
hat
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
hair
emmy
was
not
convinced
i
believe
she
said
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
zora
he
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
touched
her
arm
please
do
say
that
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
emmy
edged
up
close
to
him
as
they
walked
it
was
her
nature
even
while
she
teased
to
be
kind
and
caressing
not
even
if
it
true
why
not
things
like
that
are
not
spoken
of
he
said
soberly
they
only
felt
this
time
it
was
she
who
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
with
a
charming
sisterly
air
i
hope
you
wo
make
yourself
miserable
over
it
you
see
zora
is
impossible
she
never
marry
again
i
do
hope
it
not
serious
is
it
as
he
did
not
answer
she
continued
it
would
be
such
such
rot
wasting
your
life
over
a
thing
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
why
said
septimus
is
that
the
history
of
the
best
lives
this
philosophic
plane
was
too
high
for
emmy
who
had
her
pleasant
being
in
a
less
rarified
atmosphere
to
want
to
get
to
enjoy
was
the
guiding
motto
of
her
existence
what
was
the
use
of
wanting
unless
you
got
and
what
was
the
use
of
getting
unless
you
enjoyed
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
septimus
was
only
sentimentally
in
love
with
zora
and
she
regarded
his
tepid
passion
as
a
matter
of
no
importance
at
the
same
time
her
easy
discovery
delighted
her
it
invested
septimus
with
a
fresh
air
of
comicality
you
just
the
sort
of
man
to
write
poetry
about
her
do
you
oh
no
said
septimus
then
what
do
you
do
i
play
the
bassoon
said
he
emmy
clapped
her
hands
with
joy
thereby
scaring
a
hen
that
was
straying
on
the
common
another
accomplishment
why
did
you
tell
us
i
sure
zora
does
know
of
it
where
did
you
learn
wiggleswick
taught
me
said
he
he
was
once
in
a
band
you
must
bring
it
round
cried
emmy
but
when
septimus
prevailed
on
by
her
entreaties
did
appear
with
the
instrument
in
oldrieve
he
made
such
unearthly
and
terrific
noises
that
oldrieve
grew
pale
and
zora
politely
but
firmly
took
it
from
his
hands
and
deposited
it
in
the
in
the
hall
i
hope
you
do
mind
she
said
oh
dear
no
said
septimus
mildly
i
could
never
make
out
why
anybody
liked
it
seeing
that
septimus
had
a
sentimental
side
to
his
character
emmy
gradually
took
him
into
her
confidence
until
septimus
knew
things
that
zora
did
not
dream
of
zora
who
had
been
married
and
had
seen
the
world
from
nunsmere
pond
to
the
crater
of
mount
vesuvius
treated
her
sister
with
matronly
indulgence
as
a
child
to
whom
great
things
were
unrevealed
she
did
not
reckon
with
the
experiences
of
life
which
a
girl
must
gain
from
a
two
years
battle
on
the
stage
in
fact
she
did
not
reckon
with
any
of
the
circumstances
of
emmy
position
she
herself
was
too
ignorant
too
much
centered
as
yet
in
her
own
young
impulses
and
aspirations
and
far
too
serene
in
her
unquestioning
faith
in
the
impeccability
of
the
oldrieve
family
to
her
emmy
was
still
the
little
sister
with
caressing
ways
whom
she
could
send
upstairs
for
her
or
could
reprimand
for
a
flirtation
emmy
knew
that
zora
loved
her
dearly
but
she
was
the
least
bit
in
the
world
afraid
of
her
and
felt
that
in
affairs
of
the
heart
she
would
be
unsympathetic
so
emmy
withheld
her
confidence
from
zora
and
gave
it
to
septimus
besides
it
always
pleases
a
woman
more
to
tell
her
secrets
to
a
man
than
to
another
woman
there
is
more
excitement
in
it
even
though
the
man
be
as
unmoved
as
a
thus
it
fell
out
that
septimus
heard
of
mordaunt
prince
whose
constant
appearance
in
emmy
london
circle
of
friends
zora
had
viewed
with
plentiful
lack
of
interest
he
was
a
paragon
of
men
he
acted
like
a
salvini
and
sang
like
an
angel
he
had
been
far
too
clever
to
take
his
degree
at
oxford
he
had
just
bought
a
motor
car
and
septimus
was
not
to
whisper
a
word
of
it
to
zora
she
had
recently
been
on
a
excursion
with
him
mordaunt
prince
said
this
and
mordaunt
prince
said
that
mordaunt
paid
three
guineas
a
pair
for
his
brown
boots
he
had
lately
divorced
his
wife
an
unspeakable
creature
only
too
anxious
for
freedom
mordaunt
came
to
see
her
every
day
in
london
and
every
day
during
their
absence
they
corresponded
her
existence
was
wrapped
up
in
mordaunt
prince
she
traveled
about
with
a
or
so
it
appeared
to
septimus
full
of
his
photographs
he
had
been
the
leading
man
at
the
theater
where
she
had
her
last
engagement
and
had
fallen
madly
devotedly
passionately
in
love
with
her
as
soon
as
the
divorce
was
made
absolute
they
would
be
married
she
had
quarreled
with
her
best
friend
who
had
tried
to
make
mischief
between
them
with
a
view
to
securing
mordaunt
for
herself
had
septimus
ever
heard
of
such
a
cat
septimus
had
he
was
greatly
interested
in
as
much
of
the
story
as
he
could
follow
emmy
was
somewhat
discursive
and
as
his
interjectory
remarks
were
unprovocative
of
argument
he
constituted
himself
a
good
listener
besides
romance
had
never
come
his
way
it
was
new
to
him
even
emmy
commonplace
little
romance
like
a
field
of
roses
to
a
child
and
it
seemed
sweet
and
gracious
a
thing
to
dream
about
his
own
distant
worship
of
zora
did
not
strike
him
as
romantic
it
was
a
part
of
himself
like
the
hallowed
memory
of
his
mother
and
the
conception
of
his
devastating
guns
had
he
been
more
he
would
have
seen
possible
danger
in
romance
and
insisted
on
zora
being
taken
into
their
confidence
but
septimus
believed
that
the
radiant
beings
of
the
earth
such
as
emmy
and
mordaunt
prince
from
whom
a
quaint
destiny
kept
him
aloof
could
only
lead
radiant
lives
and
the
thought
of
harm
did
not
cross
his
candid
mind
even
while
keeping
emmy
secret
from
zora
he
regarded
it
as
a
romantic
and
even
dainty
deceit
zora
seeing
him
happy
with
his
guns
and
wiggleswick
and
emmy
applauded
herself
mightily
as
a
contriver
of
good
her
mother
also
put
ideas
into
her
head
from
the
window
they
once
saw
emmy
and
septimus
part
at
the
little
front
gate
they
had
evidently
returned
from
a
walk
she
plucked
a
great
white
chrysanthemum
bloom
from
a
bunch
she
was
carrying
flicked
it
laughingly
in
his
face
and
stuck
it
in
his
buttonhole
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
for
emmy
said
oldrieve
with
a
sigh
to
marry
septimus
oh
mother
she
laughed
merrily
then
all
at
once
she
became
serious
why
not
she
cried
and
kissed
her
mother
oldrieve
settled
her
cap
she
was
small
and
zora
was
large
and
embraces
were
often
disarranging
he
is
a
gentleman
and
can
afford
to
keep
a
wife
and
steady
said
zora
with
a
smile
i
should
think
quite
steady
said
oldrieve
without
one
and
he
would
amuse
emmy
all
day
long
i
do
think
it
is
part
of
a
husband
duty
dear
to
amuse
his
wife
said
oldrieve
the
sudden
entrance
of
emmy
full
of
fresh
air
laughter
and
chrysanthemums
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
but
thenceforward
zora
thought
seriously
of
romantic
possibilities
like
her
mother
she
did
not
entirely
approve
of
emmy
london
circle
it
was
characterized
by
too
much
freedom
too
great
a
lack
of
reticence
people
said
whatever
came
into
their
minds
and
did
apparently
whatever
occurred
to
their
bodies
she
could
not
quite
escape
from
her
mother
puritan
strain
for
herself
she
felt
secure
she
zora
could
wander
unattended
over
europe
mixing
without
spot
or
stain
with
whatever
company
she
listed
that
was
because
she
was
zora
middlemist
a
young
woman
of
exceptional
personality
and
experience
of
life
ordinary
young
persons
for
their
own
safe
conduct
ought
to
obey
the
conventions
which
were
made
with
that
end
in
view
and
emmy
was
an
ordinary
young
person
she
should
marry
it
would
conduce
to
her
moral
welfare
and
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
septimus
the
marriage
was
therefore
made
in
the
unclouded
heaven
of
zora
mind
she
shed
all
her
graciousness
over
the
young
couple
never
had
emmy
felt
herself
enwrapped
in
more
sisterly
affection
never
had
septimus
dreamed
of
such
tender
solicitude
yet
she
sang
septimus
praises
to
emmy
and
emmy
praises
to
septimus
in
so
natural
a
manner
that
neither
of
the
two
was
puzzled
it
is
the
natural
instinct
that
makes
every
woman
a
matchmaker
she
works
blindly
towards
the
baby
if
she
can
not
have
one
directly
she
will
have
it
vicariously
the
sourest
of
old
maids
is
thus
doomed
to
have
a
hand
in
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
thus
spake
the
literary
man
from
london
discoursing
generally
out
of
earshot
of
the
vicar
and
his
wife
to
whom
he
was
paying
one
of
his
periodical
visits
in
a
corner
of
their
zora
conscious
of
matchmaking
declared
him
to
be
horrid
and
physiological
a
woman
is
much
more
refined
and
delicate
in
her
motives
the
highly
civilized
woman
said
rattenden
is
delightfully
refined
in
her
table
manners
and
eats
cucumber
sandwiches
in
the
most
delicate
way
in
the
world
but
she
is
obeying
the
same
instinct
that
makes
your
lady
cannibal
thrust
raw
gobbets
of
missionary
into
her
mouth
with
her
fingers
your
conversation
is
revolting
said
zora
because
i
speak
the
truth
truth
is
a
mokanna
what
on
earth
is
that
asked
zora
the
literary
man
sighed
the
veiled
prophet
of
khorasan
lalla
rookh
tom
moore
ichabod
it
sounds
like
a
cypher
cablegram
said
zora
flippantly
but
go
on
i
will
truth
i
say
is
a
mokanna
so
long
as
it
decently
covered
with
a
silver
veil
you
all
prostrate
yourselves
before
it
and
pretend
to
worship
it
when
anyone
lifts
the
veil
and
reveals
the
revolting
horror
of
it
you
run
away
screaming
with
your
hands
before
your
eyes
why
do
you
want
truth
to
be
pretty
why
ca
you
look
its
ghastliness
bravely
in
the
face
how
can
you
expect
to
learn
anything
if
you
do
how
can
you
expect
to
form
judgments
on
men
and
things
how
can
you
expect
to
get
to
the
meaning
of
life
on
which
you
were
so
keen
a
year
ago
i
want
beauty
and
not
disgustfulness
said
zora
should
it
happen
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
i
wanted
two
dear
friends
to
marry
it
is
only
because
i
know
how
happy
they
would
be
together
the
ulterior
motive
you
suggest
is
repulsive
but
it
true
said
rattenden
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
you
more
i
could
teach
you
a
great
deal
at
any
rate
i
know
that
you
think
about
what
i
said
i
wo
she
declared
you
will
said
he
and
then
he
dropped
a
very
buttery
piece
of
buttered
toast
on
the
carpet
and
picking
it
up
said
damn
under
his
breath
and
then
they
both
laughed
and
zora
found
him
human
why
are
you
so
bent
on
educating
me
she
asked
because
said
he
i
am
one
of
the
few
men
of
your
acquaintance
who
does
want
to
marry
you
indeed
said
zora
sarcastically
yet
hating
herself
for
feeling
a
little
pang
of
displeasure
may
i
ask
why
because
said
he
i
a
wife
and
five
children
already
on
the
top
of
her
matchmaking
and
her
reflections
on
truth
in
the
guise
of
the
veiled
prophet
of
khorasan
came
clem
sypher
to
take
possession
of
his
new
house
since
zora
had
seen
him
in
monte
carlo
he
had
been
to
new
york
chicago
and
san
francisco
fighting
the
jebusa
jones
dragon
in
its
lair
he
had
written
zora
stout
dispatches
during
the
campaign
here
a
victory
there
a
defeat
everywhere
a
napoleonic
will
to
conquer
but
everywhere
also
an
implied
admission
of
the
almost
invulnerable
strength
of
his
enemy
i
physically
tired
said
he
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
spreading
his
large
frame
luxuriously
among
the
cushions
of
chesterfield
i
tired
for
the
only
time
in
my
life
i
wanted
you
he
added
with
one
of
his
quick
piercing
looks
it
a
curious
thing
but
i
kept
saying
to
myself
for
the
last
month
i
could
only
come
into
zora
middlemist
presence
and
drink
in
some
of
her
vitality
i
should
be
a
new
man
i
never
wanted
a
human
being
before
it
strange
is
it
zora
came
up
to
him
tea
in
hand
a
pleasant
smile
on
her
face
the
nunsmere
air
will
rest
you
she
said
demurely
i
do
think
much
of
the
air
if
you
not
in
it
it
like
soda
water
he
drew
a
long
breath
my
god
it
good
to
see
you
again
you
the
one
creature
on
this
earth
who
believes
in
the
cure
as
i
do
myself
zora
glanced
at
him
guiltily
her
enthusiasm
for
the
cure
as
a
religion
was
tepid
in
her
heart
she
did
not
believe
in
it
she
had
tried
it
a
few
weeks
before
on
the
sore
head
of
a
village
baby
with
disastrous
results
then
the
mother
had
called
in
the
doctor
who
wrote
out
a
simple
prescription
which
healed
the
child
immediately
the
only
real
evidence
of
its
powers
she
had
seen
was
on
septimus
brown
boots
humanity
however
forbade
her
to
deny
the
faith
with
which
clem
sypher
credited
her
also
a
genuine
feeling
of
admiration
mingled
with
pity
for
the
man
do
you
find
much
scepticism
about
she
asked
it
lack
of
enthusiasm
i
complain
of
he
replied
instead
of
accepting
it
as
the
one
remedy
people
will
use
any
other
puffed
and
advertised
stuff
chemists
are
even
lukewarm
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
of
faith
among
them
would
save
me
thousands
of
pounds
a
year
not
that
i
want
to
roll
in
money
middlemist
i
not
an
avaricious
man
but
a
great
business
requires
capital
and
to
spend
money
merely
in
flogging
the
invertebrate
is
waste
desperate
waste
it
was
the
first
time
that
zora
had
heard
the
note
of
depression
now
that
you
are
here
you
must
stay
for
a
breathing
space
she
said
kindly
you
must
forget
it
put
it
out
of
your
mind
take
a
holiday
strong
as
you
are
you
are
not
cast
iron
and
if
you
broke
down
think
what
a
disaster
it
would
be
for
the
cure
will
you
help
me
to
have
a
holiday
she
laughed
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
provided
you
do
want
to
make
me
shock
nunsmere
too
much
he
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
village
and
said
napoleonically
i
look
after
nunsmere
i
have
the
motor
here
we
can
go
all
over
the
country
will
you
come
on
one
condition
and
that
that
you
wo
spread
the
cure
among
our
surrey
villages
and
that
talk
of
something
else
all
the
time
he
rose
and
put
out
his
hand
i
accept
he
cried
frankly
i
not
a
fool
i
know
you
right
when
are
you
coming
to
see
penton
court
i
will
give
a
housewarming
you
say
that
dix
has
settled
down
here
i
look
him
up
i
be
glad
to
see
the
seraph
again
i
ask
him
to
come
too
so
there
will
be
you
and
he
and
perhaps
your
sister
will
honor
me
and
your
mother
mrs
oldrieve
mother
does
go
out
much
nowadays
said
zora
but
emmy
will
no
doubt
be
delighted
to
come
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
said
sypher
it
a
brilliant
idea
have
had
it
in
my
head
for
months
you
must
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
the
entrance
of
oldrieve
and
emmy
put
an
end
to
further
talk
of
an
intimate
nature
and
as
oldrieve
preferred
the
simple
graces
of
stereotyped
conversation
the
remainder
of
sypher
visit
was
uneventful
when
he
had
taken
his
leave
she
remarked
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
most
superior
person
i
so
glad
he
has
made
a
good
impression
on
mother
said
zora
afterwards
why
asked
emmy
it
only
natural
that
i
should
be
glad
oho
said
emmy
what
do
you
mean
nothing
dear
look
here
emmy
said
zora
half
laughing
half
angry
if
you
say
or
think
such
a
thing
i
i
slap
you
sypher
and
i
are
friends
he
has
the
remotest
idea
of
our
being
anything
else
if
he
had
i
would
never
speak
to
him
again
as
long
as
i
live
emmy
whistled
a
comedy
air
and
drummed
on
the
he
a
very
remarkable
man
said
zora
a
most
superior
person
mimicked
emmy
and
i
do
think
it
very
good
taste
in
us
to
discuss
him
in
this
manner
but
my
dear
said
emmy
it
you
that
are
discussing
him
i
not
the
only
remark
i
made
about
him
was
a
quotation
from
mother
i
going
up
to
dress
for
dinner
said
zora
she
was
just
a
little
indignant
only
into
emmy
fluffy
head
could
so
preposterous
an
idea
have
entered
clem
sypher
in
love
with
her
if
so
why
not
septimus
dix
the
thing
thus
reduced
itself
to
an
absurdity
she
laughed
to
herself
half
ashamed
of
having
allowed
emmy
to
see
that
she
took
her
child
foolishness
seriously
and
came
down
to
dinner
serene
and
indulgent
chapter
vii
are
you
going
to
have
your
bath
first
or
your
breakfast
asked
wiggleswick
putting
his
untidy
gray
head
inside
the
door
septimus
ran
his
ivory
rule
nervously
through
his
hair
i
do
know
which
would
you
advise
what
bawled
wiggleswick
septimus
repeated
his
remark
in
a
louder
voice
if
i
had
to
wash
myself
in
cold
water
said
wiggleswick
contemptuously
i
do
it
on
an
empty
stomach
but
if
the
water
were
warm
well
the
water
ai
warm
so
it
no
good
speculating
dear
me
said
septimus
now
that
just
what
i
enjoy
doing
wiggleswick
grunted
i
turn
on
the
tap
and
leave
it
the
door
having
closed
behind
his
body
servant
septimus
laid
his
ivory
rule
on
the
portion
of
the
complicated
diagram
of
machinery
which
he
had
been
measuring
off
and
soon
became
absorbed
in
his
task
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
he
had
but
lately
risen
and
sat
in
pyjamas
and
over
his
drawing
a
bundle
of
proofs
and
a
containing
a
dissipated
looking
rosebud
lay
on
that
space
of
the
table
not
occupied
by
the
sheet
of
paper
by
his
side
was
a
manuscript
covered
with
calculations
to
which
he
referred
or
added
from
time
to
time
a
bleak
november
light
came
in
through
the
window
and
septimus
chair
was
on
the
side
of
the
table
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
sit
unnecessarily
in
his
own
light
presently
a
more
than
normal
darkening
of
the
room
caused
him
to
look
at
the
window
clem
sypher
stood
outside
gazing
at
him
with
amused
curiosity
hospitably
septimus
rose
and
flung
the
casement
window
open
do
come
in
as
the
aperture
was
two
feet
square
all
of
clem
sypher
that
could
respond
to
the
invitation
was
his
head
and
shoulders
is
it
good
morning
good
afternoon
or
good
night
he
asked
surveying
septimus
attire
morning
said
septimus
i
just
got
up
have
some
breakfast
he
moved
to
a
by
the
fireplace
and
the
tug
was
immediately
followed
by
a
loud
report
what
the
devil
that
asked
sypher
startled
that
said
septimus
mildly
is
an
invention
i
pull
the
rope
and
a
pistol
is
fired
off
in
the
kitchen
wiggleswick
says
he
ca
hear
bells
what
for
breakfast
he
asked
as
wiggleswick
entered
haddock
and
the
bath
running
over
septimus
waved
him
away
let
it
run
he
turned
to
sypher
have
a
haddock
at
four
in
the
afternoon
do
you
want
me
to
be
sick
good
heavens
no
cried
septimus
do
come
in
and
i
give
you
anything
you
like
he
put
his
hand
again
on
the
a
hasty
exclamation
from
sypher
checked
his
impulse
i
say
do
do
that
again
if
you
open
the
front
door
for
me
he
added
i
may
be
able
to
get
inside
a
moment
or
two
later
sypher
was
admitted
by
the
orthodox
avenues
into
the
room
he
looked
around
him
his
hands
on
his
hips
i
wonder
what
on
earth
this
would
have
been
like
if
our
dear
lady
had
a
hand
in
it
as
septimus
imagination
was
entirely
scientific
he
could
furnish
no
solution
to
the
problem
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
bade
his
guest
sit
down
and
handed
him
a
box
of
cigars
which
also
housed
a
pair
of
compasses
some
stamps
and
a
collar
stud
sypher
selected
and
lit
a
cigar
but
declined
the
chair
for
the
moment
you
do
mind
my
looking
you
up
i
told
you
yesterday
i
would
do
it
but
you
such
a
curious
creature
there
no
knowing
at
what
hour
you
can
receive
visitors
middlemist
told
me
you
were
generally
in
to
lunch
at
four
in
the
morning
hello
an
invention
yes
said
septimus
sypher
pored
over
the
diagram
what
on
earth
is
it
all
about
it
to
prevent
people
getting
killed
in
railway
collisions
replied
septimus
you
see
the
idea
is
that
every
compartment
should
consist
of
an
outer
shell
and
an
inner
case
in
which
passengers
sit
the
roof
is
like
a
lid
when
there
a
collision
this
series
of
levers
is
set
in
motion
and
at
once
the
inner
case
is
lifted
through
the
roof
and
the
people
are
out
of
the
direct
concussion
i
have
quite
worked
it
out
yet
he
added
passing
his
hand
through
his
hair
you
see
the
same
thing
might
happen
when
they
just
coupling
some
more
carriages
on
to
a
train
at
rest
which
would
be
irritating
to
the
passengers
very
said
sypher
drily
it
would
also
come
rather
expensive
it
how
could
expense
be
an
object
when
there
are
human
lives
to
be
saved
i
think
my
friend
dix
said
sypher
you
took
the
wrong
turning
in
the
milky
way
before
you
were
born
you
were
destined
for
a
more
enlightened
planet
if
they
wo
pay
thirteen
pence
halfpenny
for
sypher
cure
how
can
you
expect
them
to
pay
millions
for
your
inventions
that
cure
but
not
going
to
talk
about
it
middlemist
orders
i
here
for
a
rest
what
are
these
proofs
writing
a
novel
he
held
up
the
bundle
with
one
of
his
kindly
smiles
and
one
of
his
swift
glances
at
septimus
it
my
book
on
guns
can
i
look
certainly
sypher
straightened
out
the
bundle
it
was
in
and
read
the
title
a
theoretical
treatise
on
the
construction
of
guns
of
large
caliber
by
septimus
dix
he
looked
through
the
pages
this
seems
like
sense
but
there
are
are
there
giving
all
this
information
no
said
septimus
modestly
it
begins
where
the
leave
off
the
guns
i
describe
have
never
been
cast
where
on
earth
do
you
get
your
knowledge
of
artillery
septimus
dreamed
through
the
mists
of
memory
a
nurse
i
once
had
married
a
bombardier
said
he
wiggleswick
entered
with
the
haddock
and
other
breakfast
appurtenances
and
while
septimus
ate
his
morning
meal
sypher
smoked
and
talked
and
looked
through
the
pages
of
the
treatise
the
lamps
lit
and
the
curtains
drawn
the
room
had
a
cosier
appearance
than
by
day
sypher
stretched
himself
comfortably
before
the
fire
i
not
in
the
way
am
i
good
heavens
no
said
septimus
i
was
just
thinking
how
pleasant
it
was
i
not
had
a
man
inside
my
rooms
since
i
was
up
at
cambridge
and
then
they
did
come
often
except
to
rag
what
did
they
do
septimus
narrated
the
burnt
umbrella
episode
and
other
social
experiences
so
that
when
a
man
comes
to
see
me
who
does
not
throw
my
things
about
he
is
doubly
welcome
he
explained
besides
he
added
after
a
drink
of
coffee
we
said
something
in
monte
carlo
about
being
friends
we
did
said
sypher
and
i
glad
you
not
forgotten
it
i
so
much
the
friend
of
humanity
in
the
bulk
that
i
somehow
been
careless
as
to
the
individual
have
a
drink
said
septimus
filling
his
pipe
the
pistol
shot
brought
wiggleswick
who
in
his
turn
brought
whiskey
and
soda
and
the
two
friends
finished
the
afternoon
in
great
amity
before
taking
his
departure
sypher
asked
whether
he
might
read
through
the
proofs
of
the
gun
book
at
home
i
think
i
know
enough
of
machinery
and
mathematics
to
understand
what
you
driving
at
and
i
should
like
to
examine
these
guns
of
yours
you
think
they
are
going
to
whip
creation
they
make
warfare
too
dangerous
to
be
carried
on
at
present
however
i
more
interested
in
my
railway
carriages
which
will
make
railway
traveling
too
dangerous
to
be
carried
on
laughed
sypher
extending
his
hand
when
he
had
gone
septimus
mused
for
some
time
in
happy
contentment
over
his
pipe
he
asked
very
little
of
the
world
and
oddly
enough
the
world
rewarded
his
modesty
by
giving
him
more
than
he
asked
for
he
had
seen
sypher
in
a
new
mood
sympathetic
unegotistical
and
he
felt
gratified
at
having
won
a
man
friendship
it
was
an
addition
to
his
few
anchorages
in
life
then
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
would
sun
himself
in
the
smiles
of
his
adored
mistress
and
listen
to
the
prattle
of
his
other
friend
emmy
oldrieve
would
be
knitting
by
the
lamp
and
probably
he
would
hold
her
wool
drop
it
and
be
scolded
as
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
family
all
of
which
was
a
very
gracious
thing
to
the
sensitive
lonely
man
warming
his
heart
and
expanding
his
nature
it
filled
his
head
with
dreams
of
a
woman
dwelling
by
right
in
this
house
of
his
and
making
the
air
fragrant
by
her
presence
but
as
the
woman
although
he
tried
his
utmost
to
prevent
it
and
to
conjure
up
the
form
of
a
totally
different
type
took
the
shape
of
zora
middlemist
he
discouraged
such
dreams
as
making
more
for
mild
unhappiness
than
for
joy
and
bent
his
thoughts
to
his
guns
and
railway
carriages
and
other
inventions
the
only
thing
that
caused
him
any
uneasiness
was
an
overdraft
at
his
bank
due
to
cover
which
he
had
to
pay
on
shares
purchased
for
him
by
a
circularizing
keeper
it
had
seemed
so
simple
to
write
shark
or
whatever
alias
the
philanthropic
financier
assumed
a
check
for
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
and
receive
shark
check
for
two
thousand
in
a
fortnight
that
he
had
wondered
why
other
people
did
not
follow
this
easy
road
to
fortune
perhaps
they
did
he
reflected
that
was
how
they
managed
to
keep
a
large
family
of
daughters
and
a
motor
car
but
when
the
shark
conveyed
to
him
in
unintelligible
terms
the
fact
that
unless
he
wrote
a
check
for
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
more
his
original
stake
would
be
lost
and
when
these
also
fell
through
the
bottomless
bucket
of
shark
and
his
bankers
called
his
attention
to
an
overdrawn
account
it
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
these
were
not
the
methods
whereby
a
large
family
of
daughters
and
a
motor
car
were
unprecariously
maintained
the
loss
did
not
distress
him
to
the
point
of
sleeplessness
his
ideas
as
to
the
value
of
money
were
as
vague
as
his
notions
on
the
rearing
of
babies
but
he
was
publishing
his
book
at
his
own
expense
and
was
concerned
at
not
being
in
a
position
to
pay
the
poor
publisher
immediately
at
oldrieve
he
found
his
previsions
nearly
all
fulfilled
zora
with
a
of
railway
and
handbooks
sought
his
counsel
as
to
a
voyage
round
the
world
which
she
had
in
contemplation
oldrieve
impressed
on
his
memory
a
recipe
for
an
omelette
which
he
was
to
convey
verbally
to
wiggleswick
although
he
confessed
that
the
only
omelette
that
wiggleswick
had
tried
to
make
they
had
used
for
months
afterwards
as
a
but
emmy
did
not
prattle
she
sat
in
a
corner
listlessly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
novel
and
taking
an
extraordinary
lack
of
interest
in
the
general
conversation
the
usual
headache
and
neuralgia
supplied
her
excuse
she
looked
pale
ill
and
worried
and
worry
on
a
baby
face
is
a
lugubrious
and
pitiful
spectacle
after
oldrieve
had
retired
for
the
night
and
while
zora
happened
to
be
absent
from
the
room
in
search
of
an
atlas
septimus
and
emmy
were
left
alone
for
a
moment
i
so
sorry
you
have
a
headache
said
septimus
sympathetically
why
do
you
go
to
bed
i
hate
bed
i
ca
sleep
she
replied
with
an
impatient
shake
of
the
body
you
must
mind
me
i
sorry
i
so
rotten
ah
well
then
such
an
uninspiring
companion
if
you
like
she
added
seeing
that
the
word
had
jarred
on
him
then
she
rose
i
suppose
i
bore
you
i
had
better
go
as
you
suggest
and
get
out
of
the
way
he
intercepted
her
petulant
march
to
the
door
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
it
is
only
a
headache
it
hell
and
the
devil
and
all
his
angels
said
emmy
and
i
like
to
murder
somebody
you
can
murder
me
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
said
septimus
i
believe
you
let
me
she
said
yielding
you
a
good
sort
she
turned
with
a
short
laugh
her
novel
held
in
both
hands
behind
her
back
one
finger
holding
the
place
a
letter
dropped
from
it
septimus
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
her
it
bore
an
italian
stamp
and
the
naples
postmark
yes
that
from
him
she
said
resentfully
i
not
had
a
letter
for
a
week
and
now
he
writes
to
say
he
has
gone
to
naples
on
account
of
his
health
you
had
better
let
me
go
my
good
septimus
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
i
be
talking
slush
and
batter
i
got
things
on
my
nerves
why
do
you
talk
to
zora
he
suggested
she
is
so
wonderful
she
the
last
person
in
the
world
that
must
know
anything
do
you
understand
the
very
last
i
afraid
i
do
understand
he
replied
ruefully
she
does
know
anything
about
mordaunt
prince
she
must
never
know
neither
must
mother
they
do
often
talk
much
about
the
family
but
they
awfully
proud
of
it
mother
people
date
from
before
noah
and
they
look
down
on
the
oldrieves
because
they
sprang
up
like
mushrooms
just
after
the
flood
prince
real
name
is
huzzle
and
his
father
kept
a
boot
shop
i
do
care
a
hang
because
he
a
gentleman
but
they
would
but
yet
you
going
to
marry
him
they
must
know
sooner
or
later
they
ought
to
know
time
enough
when
i
married
then
nothing
can
be
done
and
nothing
can
be
said
have
you
ever
thought
whether
it
would
be
well
to
give
him
up
said
septimus
in
his
hesitating
way
i
ca
i
ca
she
cried
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
afraid
lest
zora
should
surprise
her
left
the
room
without
another
word
on
such
occasions
the
most
experienced
man
is
helpless
he
shrugs
his
shoulders
says
whew
and
lights
a
cigarette
septimus
with
an
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
young
women
felt
terribly
distressed
by
the
tragedy
of
her
tears
something
must
be
done
to
stop
them
he
might
start
at
once
for
naples
and
by
the
help
of
strong
gendarmes
whom
he
might
suborn
bring
back
mordaunt
prince
presently
to
london
then
he
remembered
his
overdrawn
banking
account
and
sighfully
gave
up
the
idea
if
only
he
were
not
bound
to
secrecy
and
could
confide
in
zora
this
a
sensitive
honor
forbade
what
could
he
do
as
the
fire
was
getting
low
he
mechanically
put
on
a
lump
of
coal
with
the
pincers
when
zora
returned
with
the
atlas
she
found
him
rubbing
them
through
his
hair
and
staring
at
vacancy
if
i
do
go
round
the
world
said
zora
a
little
while
later
when
they
had
settled
on
which
side
of
south
america
valparaiso
was
situated
and
how
many
nice
and
clever
people
could
tell
you
positively
offhand
if
i
go
round
the
world
you
and
emmy
will
have
to
come
too
it
would
do
her
good
she
has
not
been
looking
well
lately
it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
her
said
he
and
for
you
too
septimus
she
remarked
with
a
quizzical
glance
and
smile
it
always
good
for
me
to
be
where
you
are
i
was
thinking
of
emmy
and
not
of
myself
she
laughed
if
you
could
take
care
of
her
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
for
you
she
would
even
trust
me
with
her
luggage
said
septimus
miles
away
from
zora
meaning
would
you
she
laughed
again
i
different
i
should
really
have
to
look
after
the
two
of
you
but
you
could
pretend
to
be
taking
care
of
emmy
i
would
do
anything
that
gave
you
pleasure
would
you
she
asked
they
were
sitting
by
the
table
the
atlas
between
them
she
moved
her
hand
and
touched
his
the
light
of
the
lamp
shone
through
her
hair
turning
it
to
luminous
gold
her
arm
was
bare
to
the
elbow
and
the
warm
fragrance
of
her
nearness
overspread
him
the
touch
thrilled
him
to
the
depths
and
he
flushed
to
his
upstanding
struwel
peter
hair
he
tried
to
say
something
he
knew
not
what
but
his
throat
was
smitten
with
sudden
dryness
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
sat
there
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
looking
stupidly
at
the
confluence
of
the
blue
veins
on
her
arm
longing
to
tell
her
that
his
senses
swam
with
the
temptation
of
her
touch
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
through
the
great
love
he
had
for
her
and
yet
lest
she
might
discover
his
secret
and
punish
his
audacity
according
to
the
summary
methods
of
juno
diana
and
other
offended
goddesses
whom
mortals
dared
to
love
it
could
only
have
been
a
few
seconds
for
he
heard
her
voice
in
his
ears
at
first
faint
and
then
gathering
distinctness
continuing
in
almost
the
same
breath
as
her
question
would
you
do
you
know
the
greatest
pleasure
you
could
give
me
it
would
be
to
become
my
brother
my
real
brother
he
turned
bewildered
eyes
upon
her
your
brother
she
laughed
half
impatiently
half
gaily
gave
his
hand
a
final
tap
and
rose
he
stood
too
mechanically
i
think
you
the
obtusest
man
i
ever
met
anyone
else
would
have
guessed
long
ago
do
you
see
you
dear
foolish
thing
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
with
agonizing
deliciousness
into
his
face
do
you
see
that
you
want
a
wife
to
save
you
from
omelettes
that
you
have
to
use
as
and
to
give
you
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
do
you
see
that
emmy
who
is
never
happier
than
when
oh
she
broke
off
impatiently
do
you
see
he
had
built
for
himself
no
card
house
of
illusion
so
it
did
not
come
toppling
down
with
dismaying
clatter
but
all
the
same
he
felt
as
if
her
kind
hands
had
turned
death
cold
and
were
wringing
his
heart
he
took
them
from
his
shoulders
and
not
unpicturesquely
kissed
her
then
he
dropped
them
and
walked
to
the
fire
and
with
his
back
to
the
room
leaned
on
the
mantelpiece
a
little
china
dog
fell
with
a
crash
into
the
fender
oh
i
so
sorry
he
began
piteously
never
mind
said
zora
helping
him
to
pick
up
the
pieces
a
man
who
can
kiss
a
woman
hands
like
that
is
at
liberty
to
clear
the
whole
house
of
gimcrackery
you
are
a
very
gracious
lady
i
said
so
long
ago
replied
septimus
i
think
i
a
fool
said
zora
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
horror
his
goddess
a
fool
she
laughed
gaily
you
look
as
if
you
were
about
to
remark
any
man
had
said
that
the
word
would
have
been
his
last
but
i
am
really
i
thought
there
might
be
something
between
you
and
emmy
and
that
a
little
encouragement
might
help
you
forgive
me
you
see
she
went
on
a
trace
of
dewiness
in
her
frank
eyes
i
love
emmy
dearly
and
in
a
sort
of
way
i
love
you
too
and
need
i
give
any
more
explanation
it
was
an
honorable
amends
royally
made
zora
had
a
magnificent
style
in
doing
such
things
an
indiscreet
venturesome
meddlesome
princess
she
might
be
if
you
will
somewhat
unreserved
somewhat
too
conscious
of
her
own
zoraesque
sufficiency
to
possess
the
true
womanly
intuition
and
sympathy
but
still
a
princess
who
had
the
grand
manner
in
her
scorn
of
trivialities
septimus
hand
shook
a
little
as
he
fitted
the
tail
to
the
hollow
bit
of
china
it
was
sweet
to
be
loved
although
it
was
bitter
to
be
loved
in
a
sort
of
way
even
a
man
like
septimus
dix
has
his
feelings
he
had
to
hide
them
you
make
me
very
happy
he
said
your
caring
so
much
for
me
as
to
wish
me
to
marry
your
sister
i
shall
never
forget
it
you
see
i
never
thought
of
her
in
that
way
i
suppose
i
do
think
of
women
at
all
in
that
way
he
went
on
with
a
certain
splendid
mendacity
it
a
case
of
instead
of
corpuscles
i
just
a
heathen
bit
of
machinery
with
my
head
full
of
diagrams
you
a
baby
said
zora
give
me
those
bits
of
dog
she
took
them
from
his
hand
and
threw
the
mutilated
body
into
the
fire
see
she
said
let
us
keep
tokens
i
keep
the
head
and
you
the
tail
if
ever
you
want
me
badly
send
me
the
tail
and
i
come
to
you
from
any
distance
and
if
i
want
you
i
send
you
the
head
i
come
to
you
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
said
septimus
so
he
went
home
a
happy
man
with
his
tail
in
his
pocket
the
next
morning
about
eight
just
as
he
was
sinking
into
his
first
sleep
he
was
awakened
through
a
sudden
dream
of
battle
by
a
series
of
revolver
shots
wondering
whether
wiggleswick
had
gone
mad
or
was
attempting
an
elaborate
and
painful
mode
of
suicide
he
leaped
out
of
bed
and
rushed
to
the
landing
what
the
matter
hello
you
up
at
last
cried
clem
sypher
appearing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
sprucely
attired
for
the
city
and
wearing
a
flower
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
overcoat
i
had
to
break
open
the
front
door
in
order
to
get
in
at
all
and
then
i
tried
shooting
the
bell
for
your
valet
can
i
come
up
do
said
septimus
shivering
do
you
mind
if
i
go
back
to
bed
do
anything
except
go
to
sleep
said
sypher
look
here
i
sorry
if
i
disturbed
you
but
i
could
wait
i
off
to
the
office
and
heaven
knows
when
i
shall
be
back
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
this
he
sat
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
threw
the
proofs
of
the
gun
book
on
to
septimus
body
vaguely
outlined
beneath
the
clothes
in
the
gray
november
light
zora
carefully
chosen
curtains
and
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
sypher
pink
and
shiny
his
silk
hat
which
he
wore
a
resplendent
miracle
of
valetry
looked
an
urban
yet
roseate
personification
of
dawn
he
seemed
as
eager
as
septimus
was
supine
i
sat
up
half
the
night
over
this
thing
said
he
and
i
really
believe
you
got
it
got
what
asked
septimus
the
biggest
thing
on
earth
bar
sypher
cure
wait
till
i
worked
out
my
railway
carriages
said
septimus
your
railway
carriages
good
gracious
have
you
any
sense
of
what
you
doing
here
you
worked
out
a
scheme
that
may
revolutionize
naval
gunnery
and
you
talk
rot
about
railway
carriages
i
glad
you
like
the
book
said
septimus
are
you
going
to
publish
it
of
course
ask
your
publisher
how
much
he
take
to
let
you
off
your
bargain
i
publishing
it
at
my
own
expense
said
septimus
in
the
middle
of
a
yawn
and
presenting
it
gratis
to
the
governments
of
the
world
yes
i
might
send
them
copies
said
septimus
it
a
good
idea
clem
sypher
thrust
his
hat
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
paced
the
room
from
the
past
the
to
the
wardrobe
and
back
again
well
i
hanged
said
he
septimus
asked
why
i
thought
i
was
a
philanthropist
said
sypher
but
by
the
side
of
you
i
a
vulture
has
it
not
struck
you
that
if
the
big
gun
is
what
i
think
any
government
on
earth
would
give
you
what
you
like
to
ask
for
the
specification
really
do
you
think
they
would
give
me
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
asked
septimus
thinking
vaguely
of
mordaunt
prince
in
naples
and
his
overdrawn
banking
account
the
anxiety
of
his
expression
was
not
lost
on
sypher
are
you
in
need
of
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
he
asked
until
my
dividends
are
due
i
been
speculating
and
i
afraid
i
have
a
head
for
business
i
afraid
you
have
grinned
sypher
leaning
over
the
footrail
of
the
bed
next
time
you
speculate
come
to
me
first
for
advice
let
me
be
your
agent
for
these
guns
will
you
i
should
be
delighted
said
septimus
and
for
the
railway
carriages
too
there
also
a
motor
car
i
invented
which
goes
by
clockwork
you
got
to
wind
it
by
means
of
a
donkey
engine
it
quite
simple
i
should
think
it
would
be
said
sypher
drily
but
i
only
take
on
the
guns
just
for
the
present
he
drew
a
check
book
from
one
pocket
and
a
fountain
pen
from
another
i
advance
you
two
hundred
pounds
for
the
sole
right
to
deal
with
the
thing
on
your
behalf
my
solicitors
will
send
you
a
document
full
of
verbiage
which
you
had
better
send
off
to
your
solicitor
to
look
through
before
you
sign
it
it
will
be
all
right
i
going
to
take
the
proofs
of

this
stops
publishing
he
remarked
looking
round
from
the
where
he
was
writing
the
check
septimus
assented
and
took
the
check
wonderingly
remarking
that
he
in
the
least
know
what
it
was
for
for
the
privilege
of
making
your
fortune
said
he
do
get
up
good
night
said
septimus
and
the
door
having
closed
behind
clem
sypher
he
thrust
the
check
beneath
the
bedclothes
curled
himself
up
and
went
to
sleep
like
a
dormouse
chapter
viii
clem
sypher
stood
at
the
front
door
of
penton
court
a
day
or
two
afterwards
awaiting
his
guests
and
taking
the
air
the
leaves
of
the
oaks
that
lined
the
drive
fell
slowly
under
the
breath
of
a
southwest
wind
and
joined
their
sodden
brethren
on
the
path
the
morning
mist
still
hung
around
the
branches
the
sky
threatened
rain
a
servant
came
from
within
the
house
bringing
a
telegram
on
a
tray
sypher
opened
it
and
his
strong
pink
face
became
as
overcast
as
the
sky
it
was
from
the
london
office
of
the
cure
and
contained
the
information
that
one
of
his
largest
buyers
had
reduced
his
usual
order
by
half
the
news
was
depressing
so
was
the
prospect
before
him
of
dripping
trees
and
of
evergreens
on
the
lawn
trying
to
make
the
best
of
it
in
forlorn
bravery
heaven
had
ordained
that
the
earth
should
be
fair
and
sypher
cure
invincible
something
was
curiously
wrong
in
the
execution
of
decrees
he
looked
again
at
the
preposterous
statement
knitting
his
brow
surely
this
was
some
base
contrivance
of
the
enemy
they
had
been
underselling
and
outadvertising
him
for
months
and
had
ousted
him
from
the
custom
of
several
large
firms
already
something
had
to
be
done
as
has
been
remarked
before
sypher
was
a
man
of
napoleonic
methods
he
called
for
a
telegraph
form
and
wrote
as
he
stood
with
the
tray
as
a
desk
if
you
ca
buy
advertising
rights
on
paul
cathedral
or
westminster
abbey
secure
outside
pages
of
usual
dailies
for
thursday
will
draw
up
myself
he
gave
it
to
the
servant
smiled
in
anticipation
of
the
battle
and
felt
better
when
zora
emmy
and
septimus
appeared
at
the
turn
of
the
drive
he
rushed
to
meet
them
beaming
with
welcome
and
exuberant
in
phrase
this
was
the
best
housewarming
that
could
be
imagined
just
three
friends
to
luncheon
three
live
people
a
gathering
of
folk
would
have
converted
the
house
into
a
chilly
barn
they
would
warm
it
with
the
glow
of
friendship
middlemist
looking
like
a
rose
in
june
had
already
irradiated
the
wan
november
garden
miss
oldrieve
he
likened
to
a
spring
crocus
and
septimus
with
a
slap
on
the
back
could
choose
the
vegetable
he
would
like
to
resemble
they
must
look
over
the
house
before
lunch
afterwards
outside
the
great
surprise
awaited
them
what
was
it
ah
he
turned
laughing
eyes
on
them
like
a
boy
the
great
london
firm
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
the
furniture
and
decoration
had
done
their
splendid
worst
the
had
the
appearance
of
an
hotel
trying
to
look
coy
an
air
of
factitious
geniality
pervaded
the
an
engraving
of
frans
hals
laughing
cavalier
hung
with
too
great
a
semblance
of
jollity
over
the
oak
sideboard
everything
was
too
new
too
ordered
too
unindividual
but
sypher
loved
it
especially
the
and
restless
frieze
zora
a
woman
of
instinctive
taste
who
if
she
bought
a
bedroom
managed
to
identify
it
with
her
own
personality
professed
her
admiration
with
a
woman
pitying
mendacity
but
resolved
to
change
many
things
for
the
good
of
clem
sypher
soul
emmy
still
pale
and
preoccupied
said
little
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
appreciate
clem
sypher
whose
loud
voice
and
napoleonic
manners
jarred
upon
her
nerves
septimus
thought
it
all
prodigiously
fine
whereat
emmy
waxed
sarcastic
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
he
said
heedless
of
her
taunts
during
a
moment
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
he
had
already
offered
to
go
to
naples
and
bring
back
mordaunt
prince
and
had
received
instant
orders
not
to
be
a
fool
i
wish
i
could
make
you
laugh
again
i
do
want
to
laugh
she
replied
impatiently
i
want
to
sit
on
the
floor
and
howl
they
happened
to
be
in
the
hall
at
the
farther
end
septimus
caught
sight
of
a
fluffy
persian
kitten
playing
with
a
bit
of
paper
and
guided
by
one
of
his
queer
intuitions
he
went
and
picked
it
up
and
laid
its
baby
softness
against
the
girl
cheek
her
mood
changed
magically
oh
the
darling
she
cried
and
kissed
its
tiny
wet
nose
she
was
quite
polite
to
sypher
during
luncheon
and
laughed
when
he
told
her
that
he
called
the
kitten
jebusa
jones
she
asked
why
because
said
he
showing
his
hand
covered
with
scratches
she
produces
on
the
human
epidermis
the
same
effect
as
his
poisonous
cuticle
remedy
whereupon
emmy
decided
that
the
man
who
could
let
a
kitten
scratch
his
hand
in
that
fashion
had
elements
of
good
in
his
nature
now
for
the
surprise
said
sypher
when
septimus
and
he
joined
the
ladies
after
lunch
come
they
followed
him
outside
through
the
french
windows
of
the
other
people
said
he
want
houses
with
lawns
reaching
down
to
the
side
of
the
river
or
the
menai
straits
or
windermere
i
the
only
person
i
think
who
has
ever
sought
for
a
lawn
running
down
to
a
main
line
of
railway
that
why
this
house
was
untenanted
so
long
said
zora
a
row
of
trees
separated
the
small
garden
from
the
lawn
in
question
when
they
passed
through
this
screen
the
lawn
and
the
line
of
railway
and
the
dreamy
undulating
surrey
country
came
into
view
also
an
enormous
board
why
had
he
taken
it
down
zora
asked
that
the
surprise
exclaimed
sypher
eagerly
come
round
to
the
front
he
led
the
way
striding
some
yards
ahead
presently
he
turned
and
struck
a
dramatic
attitude
as
a
man
might
do
who
had
built
himself
a
new
wonder
house
and
then
on
three
astonished
pairs
of
eyes
burst
the
following
inscription
in
gigantic
capitals
which
he
who
flew
by
in
an
express
train
could
read
sypher
cure
clem
sypher
friend
of
humanity
i
live
here
is
that
great
he
cried
i
had
it
in
my
mind
for
years
it
the
personal
note
that
so
valuable
this
brings
the
whole
passing
world
into
personal
contact
with
me
it
shows
that
sypher
cure
is
a
quack
thing
run
by
a
commercial
company
but
the
possession
of
a
man
who
has
a
house
who
lives
in
the
very
house
you
can
see
through
the
trees
kind
of
a
man
is
he
they
ask
must
be
a
nice
man
to
live
in
such
a
nice
house
i
almost
feel
i
know
him
try
his
do
you
think
it
a
colossal
idea
he
looked
questioningly
into
three
embarrassed
faces
emmy
in
spite
of
her
own
preoccupation
suppressed
a
giggle
there
was
a
moment
silence
which
was
broken
by
septimus
mild
voice
i
think
by
means
of
levers
running
down
to
the
line
and
worked
by
the
trains
as
they
passed
i
could
invent
a
machine
for
throwing
little
boxes
of
samples
from
the
board
into
the
railway
carriage
windows
emmy
burst
out
laughing
come
and
show
me
how
you
would
do
it
she
linked
her
arm
in
his
and
dragged
him
down
to
the
line
where
she
spoke
with
mirthful
disrespect
of
sypher
cure
meanwhile
zora
said
nothing
to
sypher
do
you
like
it
he
asked
at
last
disconcerted
do
you
want
me
to
be
the
polite
lady
you
asked
to
lunch
or
your
friend
my
friend
and
my
helper
said
he
then
she
replied
touching
his
coat
sleeve
i
must
say
that
i
like
it
i
hate
it
i
think
it
everything
that
is
most
abominable
the
board
was
one
pride
of
his
heart
and
zora
was
another
he
looked
at
them
both
alternately
in
a
piteous
crestfallen
way
but
why
he
asked
zora
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
saw
that
her
lack
of
appreciation
had
hurt
him
to
the
heart
she
was
a
generous
woman
and
did
not
convict
him
as
she
would
have
done
another
man
of
blatant
vulgarity
yet
she
felt
preposterously
pained
why
could
not
this
great
creature
with
ideas
as
high
as
they
were
queer
perceive
the
board
rank
abomination
it
unworthy
of
you
she
said
bravely
i
want
everyone
to
respect
you
as
i
do
you
see
the
cure
is
everything
there
a
man
behind
it
that
the
object
of
the
board
said
sypher
to
show
the
man
but
it
does
show
the
chivalrous
gentleman
that
i
think
you
are
she
replied
quickly
it
gives
the
impression
of
some
one
quite
different
a
horrid
creature
who
would
sell
his
for
money
oh
do
you
understand
it
as
bad
as
walking
through
the
streets
with
painted
on
your
hat
what
can
i
do
about
it
he
asked
take
it
down
at
once
said
zora
but
to
exhibit
the
board
was
my
sole
reason
for
buying
the
place
i
very
sorry
she
said
gently
but
i
ca
change
my
opinion
he
cast
a
lingering
glance
at
the
board
and
then
turned
let
us
go
back
to
the
house
he
said
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
as
they
passed
by
the
shrubbery
at
the
side
of
the
house
he
gravely
pushed
aside
a
wet
hanging
branch
for
her
to
proceed
dry
then
he
joined
her
again
you
are
angry
with
me
for
speaking
so
said
zora
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
his
eyes
bright
and
clear
do
you
think
a
born
fool
do
you
think
i
ca
tell
loyalty
when
i
see
it
and
am
such
an
ass
as
not
to
prize
it
above
all
things
it
cost
you
a
lot
to
say
that
to
me
you
right
i
suppose
i
lost
sense
of
myself
in
the
cure
when
i
think
of
it
i
seem
just
to
be
the
machine
that
is
distributing
it
over
the
earth
and
that
too
i
suppose
is
why
i
want
you
the
board
is
an
abomination
that
cries
to
heaven
it
shall
be
instantly
removed
there
he
held
out
his
hand
she
gave
him
hers
and
he
pressed
it
warmly
are
you
going
to
give
up
the
house
now
that
it
useless
she
asked
do
you
wish
me
to
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
zora
middlemist
said
he
i
a
superstitious
man
in
some
things
you
have
everything
to
do
with
my
success
sooner
than
forfeit
your
respect
i
would
set
fire
to
every
stick
i
possessed
i
would
give
up
everything
i
had
in
the
world
except
my
faith
in
the
cure
would
you
give
up
that
if
it
were
necessary
so
as
to
keep
my
respect
she
asked
prompted
by
the
insane
devil
that
lurks
in
the
heart
of
even
the
most
sainted
of
women
and
does
not
like
its
gracious
habitat
to
be
reckoned
lower
than
a
quack
ointment
it
is
the
same
little
devil
that
makes
a
young
wife
ask
her
devoted
husband
which
of
the
two
he
would
save
if
she
and
his
mother
were
drowning
it
is
the
little
devil
that
is
responsible
for
infinite
mendacity
on
the
part
of
men
have
you
ever
said
that
to
another
woman
no
of
course
he
has
and
the
wretch
is
instantly
perjured
would
you
sell
your
soul
for
me
my
immortal
soul
says
the
good
fellow
instantaneously
converted
into
an
atrocious
liar
and
the
little
devil
coos
with
satisfaction
and
curls
himself
up
snugly
to
sleep
but
on
this
occasion
the
little
devil
had
no
success
i
would
give
up
my
faith
in
the
cure
for
nothing
in
the
wide
world
said
sypher
gravely
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
said
zora
in
her
frankest
tone
but
the
little
devil
asked
her
whether
she
was
quite
sure
whereupon
she
hit
him
smartly
over
the
head
and
bade
him
lie
down
her
respect
however
for
sypher
increased
they
were
joined
by
emmy
and
septimus
i
think
i
could
manage
it
said
the
latter
if
i
cut
a
hole
a
foot
square
in
the
board
and
fixed
a
magazine
behind
it
there
will
be
no
necessity
returned
sypher
middlemist
has
ordered
its
immediate
removal
that
was
the
end
of
the
board
episode
the
next
day
he
had
it
taken
down
and
chopped
into
a
of
which
he
sent
with
his
humble
compliments
to
middlemist
zora
called
it
a
burnt
offering
she
found
more
satisfaction
in
the
blaze
that
roared
up
the
chimney
than
she
could
explain
to
her
mother
perhaps
more
than
she
could
explain
to
herself
septimus
had
first
taught
her
the
pleasantness
of
power
but
that
was
nothing
to
this
anybody
even
emmy
baby
that
she
was
could
turn
poor
septimus
into
a
slave
for
a
woman
to
impose
her
will
upon
clem
sypher
friend
of
humanity
the
colossus
of
curemongers
was
no
such
trumpery
achievement
emmy
when
she
referred
to
the
matter
expressed
the
hope
that
zora
had
rubbed
it
into
clem
sypher
zora
deprecated
the
personal
bearing
of
the
slang
metaphor
but
admitted
somewhat
grandly
that
she
had
pointed
out
the
error
in
taste
i
ca
see
though
why
you
take
all
this
trouble
over
sypher
said
emmy
i
value
his
friendship
replied
zora
looking
up
from
a
letter
she
was
reading
this
was
at
breakfast
when
the
maid
had
entered
with
the
post
emmy
had
gripped
the
table
and
watched
with
hungry
eyes
but
the
only
letter
that
had
come
for
her
had
been
on
theatrical
business
not
the
one
she
longed
for
emmy
world
was
out
of
joint
you
changed
your
opinion
my
dear
as
to
the
value
of
men
she
sneered
there
was
a
time
when
you
did
want
to
see
them
or
speak
to
them
or
have
anything
to
do
with
them
now
it
seems
you
ca
get
on
without
them
my
dear
emmy
said
zora
calmly
men
as
possible
lovers
and
men
as
staunch
friends
are
two
entirely
different
conceptions
emmy
broke
a
piece
of
toast
viciously
i
think
they
beasts
she
exclaimed
good
heavens
why
oh
i
do
know
they
are
then
after
the
quick
frightened
glance
of
the
woman
who
fears
she
has
said
too
much
she
broke
into
a
careless
they
are
such
liars
fawcett
promised
me
a
part
in
his
new
production
and
writes
to
say
i
ca
have
it
as
emmy
professional
disappointments
had
been
many
and
as
zora
in
her
heart
of
hearts
did
not
entirely
approve
of
her
sister
career
she
tempered
her
sympathy
with
philosophic
reflections
she
had
never
taken
emmy
seriously
all
her
life
long
emmy
had
been
the
kitten
sister
with
a
kitten
pretty
but
unimportant
likes
dislikes
habits
occupations
and
aspirations
to
regard
her
as
being
under
the
shadow
of
a
woman
tragedy
had
never
entered
her
head
the
kitten
playing
antigone
ophelia
or
such
like
distressed
heroines
in
awful
grim
earnest
is
not
a
conception
that
readily
occurs
even
to
the
most
affectionate
and
imaginative
of
kitten
owners
zora
accepted
emmy
explanation
of
her
petulance
with
a
spirit
entirely
unperturbed
and
resumed
the
perusal
of
her
letter
it
was
from
the
callenders
who
wrote
from
california
zora
must
visit
them
on
her
way
round
the
world
she
laid
down
the
letter
and
stirred
her
tea
absently
her
mind
full
of
sierras
and
clear
blue
air
and
peach
forests
and
all
the
wonders
of
that
wonderland
and
emmy
stirred
her
tea
too
in
an
absent
manner
but
her
mind
was
filled
with
the
most
terrible
thoughts
wherewith
a
woman
mind
can
be
haunted
chapter
ix
septimus
had
never
seen
a
woman
faint
before
at
first
he
thought
emmy
was
dead
and
rubbed
agonized
hands
together
like
a
fly
when
he
realized
what
had
happened
he
produced
a
large
which
he
always
carried
in
his
trousers
pocket
for
the
purpose
he
explained
of
sharpening
pencils
and
offered
it
to
zora
with
the
vague
idea
that
the
first
aid
to
fainting
women
consisted
in
cutting
their
zora
rebuked
him
for
futility
and
bade
him
ring
the
bell
for
the
maid
it
was
all
very
sudden
the
scene
had
been
one
that
of
late
had
grown
so
familiar
zora
and
septimus
poring
over
world
itineraries
the
latter
full
of
ineffectual
suggestion
and
irrelevant
reminiscence
and
emmy
reading
by
the
fire
on
this
occasion
it
was
the
newspaper
which
septimus
who
had
spent
the
day
in
london
on
an
unexecuted
errand
to
his
publisher
had
brought
back
with
him
evening
papers
being
luxuries
in
nunsmere
he
had
hidden
it
carefully
from
wiggleswick
in
order
to
present
it
to
the
ladies
suddenly
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
slither
by
the
and
emmy
in
a
dead
faint
hung
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
her
hand
she
grasped
the
outer
sheet
of
the
paper
the
inner
sheet
according
to
the
untidy
ways
of
women
with
newspapers
lay
discarded
on
the
floor
with
septimus
help
zora
and
the
maid
carried
her
to
the
sofa
they
opened
the
window
and
gave
her
smelling
salts
septimus
anxiously
desired
to
be
assured
that
she
was
not
dying
and
zora
thanked
heaven
that
her
mother
had
gone
to
bed
presently
emmy
recovered
consciousness
i
must
have
fainted
she
said
in
a
whisper
yes
dear
said
zora
kneeling
by
her
side
are
you
better
emmy
stared
past
zora
at
something
unseen
and
terrifying
it
was
foolish
the
heat
i
suppose
sypher
burning
board
she
turned
an
appealing
glance
to
septimus
did
i
say
anything
silly
when
he
told
her
that
she
had
slipped
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
without
a
word
she
looked
relieved
and
closed
her
eyes
as
soon
as
she
had
revived
sufficiently
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
but
before
going
she
pressed
septimus
hand
with
feverish
significance
even
to
so
inexperienced
a
mind
as
his
the
glance
and
the
conveyed
a
sense
of
trust
suggested
dimly
a
reason
for
the
fainting
fit
once
more
he
stood
alone
and
perplexed
in
the
little
once
more
he
passed
his
long
fingers
through
his
struwel
peter
hair
and
looked
about
the
room
for
inspiration
finding
none
he
mechanically
gathered
up
the
two
parts
of
the
newspaper
with
a
man
instinct
for
tidiness
in
printed
matter
and
smoothed
out
the
crumples
that
emmy
hand
had
made
on
the
outer
sheet
whilst
doing
so
a
paragraph
met
his
eye
causing
him
to
stare
helplessly
at
the
paper
it
was
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
of
mordaunt
prince
at
the
british
consulate
in
naples
the
unutterable
perfidy
of
man
for
the
first
time
in
his
guileless
life
septimus
met
it
face
to
face
to
read
of
human
depravity
in
the
police
reports
is
one
thing
to
see
it
fall
like
a
black
shadow
across
one
life
is
another
it
horrified
him
mordaunt
prince
had
committed
the
unforgivable
sin
he
had
stolen
a
girl
love
and
basely
meanly
he
had
slunk
off
deceiving
her
to
the
last
to
septimus
the
lover
who
kissed
and
rode
away
had
ever
appeared
a
despicable
figure
of
romance
the
fellow
who
did
it
in
real
life
proclaimed
himself
an
unconscionable
scoundrel
the
memory
of
emmy
blue
eyes
turning
into
sapphires
as
she
sang
the
villain
praises
smote
him
he
clenched
his
fists
and
put
to
incoherent
use
his
limited
vocabulary
of
anathema
then
fearing
in
his
excited
state
to
meet
zora
lest
he
should
betray
the
miserable
secret
he
stuffed
the
newspaper
into
his
pocket
and
crept
out
of
the
house
before
his
own
fire
he
puzzled
over
the
problem
something
must
be
done
but
what
hale
mordaunt
prince
from
his
bride
arms
and
bring
him
penitent
to
nunsmere
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
seeing
that
polygamy
is
not
openly
sanctioned
by
western
civilization
proceed
to
naples
and
chastise
him
that
were
better
the
monster
deserved
it
but
how
are
men
chastised
septimus
had
no
experience
he
reflected
vaguely
that
people
did
this
sort
of
thing
with
a
horsewhip
he
speculated
on
the
kind
of
horsewhip
that
would
be
necessary
a
hunting
crop
with
no
lash
would
not
be
more
effective
than
an
ordinary
walking
stick
with
a
lash
it
would
be
cumbrous
unless
he
kept
at
an
undignified
distance
and
flicked
at
his
victim
as
the
in
the
circus
flicks
at
the
clown
perhaps
horsewhips
for
this
particular
purpose
could
be
obtained
from
the
army
and
navy
stores
it
should
be
about
three
feet
long
flexible
and
tapering
to
a
point
unconsciously
his
inventive
faculty
began
to
work
when
he
had
devised
an
adequate
instrument
made
of
fine
steel
wires
ingeniously
plaited
he
awoke
somewhat
to
the
commonplaces
of
the
original
problem
what
was
to
be
done
he
pondered
for
some
hours
then
he
sighed
and
sought
consolation
in
his
bassoon
but
after
a
few
bars
of
annie
laurie
he
put
the
unedifying
instrument
back
in
its
corner
and
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
a
starry
night
of
frost
nunsmere
lay
silent
as
bethlehem
and
a
star
hung
low
in
the
east
far
away
across
the
common
gleamed
one
solitary
light
in
the
vicarage
windows
the
vicar
good
gentleman
finishing
his
unruffled
sermon
while
his
parish
slept
otherwise
darkness
spread
over
everything
save
the
sky
not
a
creature
on
the
road
not
a
creature
on
the
common
not
even
the
lame
donkey
incredibly
distant
the
faint
sound
of
a
railway
whistle
intensified
the
stillness
septimus
own
footsteps
on
the
crisp
grass
rang
loud
in
his
ears
yet
both
stillness
and
darkness
felt
companionable
in
harmony
with
the
starlit
dimness
of
the
man
mind
his
soul
was
having
its
adventure
while
mystery
filled
the
outer
air
he
walked
on
wrapped
in
the
nebulous
fantasies
which
passed
with
him
for
thought
heedless
as
he
always
was
of
the
flight
of
time
once
he
halted
by
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
sitting
on
a
bench
lit
and
smoked
his
pipe
until
the
cold
forced
him
to
rise
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
hear
some
earthly
sound
he
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
into
the
water
he
shivered
at
the
ghostly
splash
and
moved
away
himself
an
ineffectual
ghost
wandering
aimlessly
in
the
night
the
vicar
lamp
had
been
extinguished
long
ago
a
faint
breeze
sprang
up
the
star
sank
lower
in
the
sky
suddenly
as
he
turned
back
from
the
road
to
cross
the
common
for
the
hundredth
time
he
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
footsteps
rather
felt
than
heard
were
in
front
of
him
he
pressed
forward
and
peered
through
the
darkness
and
finally
made
out
a
dim
form
some
thirty
yards
away
idly
he
followed
and
soon
recognized
the
figure
as
that
of
a
woman
hurrying
fast
why
a
woman
should
be
crossing
nunsmere
common
at
four
in
the
morning
passed
his
power
of
conjecture
she
was
going
neither
to
nor
from
the
doctor
whose
house
lay
behind
the
vicarage
on
the
right
all
at
once
her
objective
became
clear
to
him
he
thought
of
the
splash
of
the
stone
she
was
making
straight
for
the
pond
he
hastened
his
pace
came
up
within
a
few
yards
of
her
and
then
stopped
dead
it
was
emmy
he
recognized
the
zibeline
toque
and
coat
edged
with
the
same
fur
which
she
often
wore
she
carried
something
in
her
hand
he
could
not
tell
what
she
went
on
unconscious
of
his
nearness
he
followed
her
emmy
a
new
ophelia
was
about
to
seek
a
watery
grave
for
herself
and
her
love
sorrow
again
came
the
problem
which
in
moments
of
emergency
septimus
had
never
learned
to
solve
what
should
he
do
across
the
agony
of
his
mind
shot
a
feeling
of
horrible
indelicacy
in
thrusting
himself
upon
a
woman
at
such
a
moment
he
was
half
tempted
to
turn
back
and
leave
her
to
the
sanctity
of
her
grief
but
again
the
splash
echoed
in
his
ears
and
again
he
shivered
the
water
was
so
black
and
cold
and
what
could
he
say
to
zora
the
thought
lashed
his
pace
to
sudden
swiftness
and
emmy
turned
with
a
little
scream
of
fear
who
are
you
it
i
septimus
he
stammered
taking
hold
of
his
cap
for
god
sake
do
do
it
i
shall
go
away
how
dare
you
spy
on
me
she
stood
and
faced
him
and
her
features
were
just
discernible
in
the
dim
starlight
anger
rang
in
her
voice
she
stamped
her
foot
how
dare
you
i
have
been
spying
on
you
he
explained
i
only
recognized
you
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
i
was
walking
about
taking
a
stroll
before
breakfast
you
know
oh
she
said
stonily
i
dreadfully
sorry
to
have
intruded
upon
you
he
continued
twirling
his
cap
nervously
in
his
fingers
while
the
breeze
played
through
his
upstanding
hair
i
did
mean
to
but
i
could
stand
by
and
let
you
do
it
i
could
really
do
what
she
asked
still
angry
septimus
did
not
know
that
beneath
the
jacket
her
heart
was
thumping
madly
drown
yourself
said
septimus
in
the
pond
she
laughed
hysterically
in
three
feet
of
water
how
do
you
think
i
was
going
to
manage
it
septimus
reflected
he
had
not
thought
of
the
pond
inadequate
depth
you
might
have
lain
down
at
the
bottom
until
it
was
all
over
he
remarked
in
perfect
seriousness
i
once
heard
of
a
servant
girl
who
drowned
herself
in
a
basin
of
water
emmy
turned
impatiently
and
walking
on
waved
him
away
but
he
accompanied
her
mechanically
oh
do
follow
me
she
cried
in
a
queer
voice
leave
me
alone
for
god
sake
i
not
going
to
commit
suicide
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
the
pluck
but
if
you
not
going
to
do
that
why
on
earth
are
you
here
i
taking
a
stroll
before
breakfast
just
like
yourself
why
am
i
here
if
you
really
want
to
know
she
added
defiantly
i
going
to
london
by
the
early
train
from
hensham
the
milk
train
see
i
respectable
i
have
my
luggage
she
swung
something
in
the
dark
before
him
and
he
perceived
that
it
was
a
handbag
now
are
you
satisfied
or
do
you
think
i
was
going
to
take
a
handkerchief
and
a
powder
puff
into
the
other
world
with
me
just
simply
going
to
london
nothing
more
but
it
a
walk
to
hensham
she
made
no
reply
but
quickened
her
pace
septimus
in
a
whirl
of
doubt
and
puzzledom
walked
by
her
side
still
holding
his
cap
in
his
hand
even
the
intelligence
of
the
local
policeman
would
have
connected
her
astounding
appearance
on
the
common
with
the
announcement
in
the
he
took
that
for
granted
but
if
she
were
not
about
to
destroy
herself
why
this
untimely
flight
to
london
why
walk
seven
miles
in
wintry
darkness
when
she
could
have
caught
a
train
at
ripstead
a
mile
away
a
few
hours
later
in
orthodox
comfort
it
was
a
mystery
a
tragic
and
perplexing
mystery
they
passed
by
the
pond
in
silence
crossed
the
common
and
reached
the
main
road
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
emmy
he
said
at
last
i
hate
forcing
my
company
upon
you
and
yet
i
feel
i
should
be
doing
wrong
to
leave
you
unprotected
you
see
i
should
not
be
able
to
face
zora
you
had
better
face
her
as
late
as
possible
she
replied
quickly
perhaps
you
had
better
walk
to
the
station
with
me
would
you
it
would
ease
my
mind
all
right
only
for
god
sake
do
chatter
i
do
want
you
of
all
people
to
get
on
my
nerves
let
me
carry
your
bag
said
septimus
and
you
had
better
have
my
stick
the
process
of
transference
brought
to
his
consciousness
the
fact
of
his
bareheadedness
he
put
on
his
cap
and
they
trudged
along
the
road
like
gipsy
man
and
wife
saying
not
a
word
to
each
other
for
two
miles
they
proceeded
thus
sometimes
in
utter
blackness
when
the
road
wound
between
thick
oak
plantations
sometimes
in
the
lesser
dimness
of
the
open
when
it
passed
by
the
rolling
fields
and
not
a
sign
of
human
life
disturbed
the
country
stillness
then
they
turned
into
the
london
road
and
passed
through
a
village
lights
were
in
the
windows
one
cottage
door
stood
open
a
shaft
of
light
streamed
across
emmy
face
and
septimus
caught
a
glimpse
of
drawn
and
haggard
misery
they
went
on
for
another
mile
now
and
then
a
laborer
passed
them
with
an
unsurprised
greeting
a
milkcart
rattled
by
and
then
all
was
silence
again
gradually
the
stars
lost
brilliance
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
foot
of
a
rise
crowned
by
a
cottage
looming
black
against
the
sky
emmy
broke
down
and
cast
herself
on
a
heap
of
stones
by
the
side
of
the
road
a
helpless
bundle
of
sobs
and
incoherent
lamentations
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
why
had
he
not
spoken
to
her
she
could
go
no
further
she
wished
she
were
dead
what
was
going
to
become
of
her
how
could
he
walk
by
her
side
saying
nothing
like
a
dumb
jailer
he
had
better
go
back
to
nunsmere
and
leave
her
to
die
by
the
wayside
it
was
all
she
asked
of
heaven
oh
god
have
pity
on
me
she
moaned
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
septimus
stood
for
a
time
in
acute
distress
this
was
his
first
adventure
in
and
he
had
served
before
neither
as
page
nor
squire
he
would
have
given
his
head
to
say
the
unknown
words
that
might
comfort
her
all
he
could
do
was
to
pat
her
on
the
shoulder
in
a
futile
way
and
bid
her
not
to
cry
which
as
all
the
world
knows
is
the
greatest
encouragement
to
further
shedding
of
tears
a
weeping
woman
can
have
emmy
sobbed
more
bitterly
than
ever
once
more
on
that
night
of
agonizing
dubiety
what
was
to
be
done
he
looked
round
desperately
for
guidance
and
as
he
looked
a
light
appeared
in
the
window
of
the
hilltop
cottage
perhaps
said
he
if
i
knock
at
the
door
up
there
they
can
give
you
a
glass
of
milk
or
a
cup
of
tea
he
added
brightening
with
the
glow
of
inspiration
or
they
may
be
able
to
let
you
lie
down
for
a
while
but
emmy
shook
her
head
miserably
milk
tea
recumbent
luxury
were
as
nothing
to
her
neither
poppy
nor
mandragora
or
words
to
that
effect
could
give
her
ease
again
and
she
could
walk
four
miles
and
she
must
catch
the
morning
train
if
you
tell
me
what
i
can
do
said
septimus
i
do
it
a
creaky
rumble
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
presently
they
made
out
a
cart
coming
slowly
down
the
hill
septimus
had
another
brilliant
idea
let
me
put
you
into
that
and
take
you
back
to
nunsmere
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
clutched
his
arm
never
never
do
you
hear
i
could
bear
it
mother
zora
i
see
them
again
last
night
they
nearly
drove
me
into
hysterics
what
do
you
suppose
i
came
out
for
at
this
hour
if
it
was
to
avoid
meeting
them
let
us
go
on
if
i
die
on
the
road
so
much
the
better
perhaps
said
septimus
i
could
carry
you
she
softened
linked
her
arm
in
his
and
almost
laughed
as
they
started
up
the
hill
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
and
i
been
behaving
like
a
beast
anyone
but
you
would
have
worried
me
with
questions
and
small
wonder
but
you
have
even
asked
me
hush
said
septimus
i
know
i
saw
the
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
let
talk
of
it
let
us
talk
of
something
else
do
you
like
honey
the
great
bear
put
me
in
mind
wiggleswick
wants
to
keep
bees
i
tell
him
if
he
does
i
keep
a
bear
he
could
eat
the
honey
you
see
and
then
i
could
teach
him
to
dance
by
playing
the
bassoon
to
him
perhaps
he
would
like
the
bassoon
he
continued
after
a
pause
in
his
wistful
way
nobody
else
does
if
you
had
it
with
you
now
i
should
love
it
for
your
sake
said
emmy
with
a
sob
if
you
would
take
my
advice
and
rest
in
the
cottage
i
could
send
for
it
he
replied
unsmilingly
we
must
catch
the
train
said
emmy
in
wirley
half
a
mile
further
folks
were
stirring
a
cart
laden
with
market
produce
waited
by
a
cottage
door
for
the
driver
who
stood
swallowing
his
final
cup
of
tea
a
child
clung
round
his
leg
an
attendant
hebe
the
wanderers
halted
if
the
other
cart
could
have
taken
us
back
to
nunsmere
said
septimus
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
arrived
at
truth
this
one
can
carry
us
to
the
station
and
so
it
fell
out
the
men
made
emmy
as
comfortable
as
could
be
among
the
cabbages
with
some
sacks
for
rugs
and
there
she
lay
drowsy
with
pain
and
weariness
until
they
came
to
the
end
of
their
journey
a
or
two
accentuated
the
murky
dismalness
of
the
little
station
emmy
sank
exhausted
on
a
bench
in
the
booking
hail
numb
with
cold
and
too
woebegone
to
think
of
her
hair
which
straggled
limply
from
beneath
the
zibeline
toque
septimus
went
to
the
booking
office
and
asked
for
two
tickets
to
london
when
he
joined
her
again
she
was
crying
softly
you
coming
with
me
it
is
good
of
you
i
responsible
for
you
to
zora
a
shaft
of
jealousy
shot
through
her
tears
you
always
think
of
zora
to
think
of
her
replied
septimus
vaguely
allusive
is
a
liberal
education
emmy
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
was
not
of
the
type
that
makes
paragons
out
of
her
own
sex
and
she
had
also
a
sisterly
knowledge
of
zora
unharmonious
with
septimus
poetic
conception
but
she
felt
too
miserable
to
argue
she
asked
him
the
time
at
last
the
train
came
in
there
was
a
great
rattling
of
on
the
gloomy
platform
and
various
slouching
shapes
entered
carriages
the
wanderers
had
the
only
compartment
to
themselves
it
struck
cold
and
noisome
like
a
peculiarly
unaired
a
feeble
lamp
whose
effect
was
dimmed
by
the
swishing
dirty
oil
in
the
bottom
of
the
globe
gave
a
pretense
at
illumination
the
guard
passing
by
the
window
turned
his
lantern
on
them
and
paused
for
a
wondering
moment
were
they
a
runaway
couple
if
so
thought
he
they
had
arrived
at
quick
repentance
as
they
looked
too
dismal
for
tips
he
concerned
himself
with
them
no
more
the
train
started
emmy
shook
with
cold
in
spite
of
her
jacket
septimus
took
off
his
overcoat
and
spread
it
over
their
two
bodies
as
they
huddled
together
for
warmth
after
a
while
her
head
drooped
on
his
shoulder
and
she
slept
while
septimus
sucked
his
empty
pipe
not
daring
to
light
it
lest
he
should
disturb
her
slumbers
for
the
same
reason
he
forbore
to
change
his
original
awkward
attitude
and
in
consequence
suffered
agonies
of
pins
and
needles
to
have
a
solid
young
woman
asleep
in
your
arms
is
not
the
romantic
pleasure
the
poets
make
out
for
comfort
she
might
just
as
well
stand
on
your
head
also
as
emmy
unconsciously
drew
the
overcoat
away
from
him
one
side
of
his
body
perished
with
cold
and
a
dinner
suit
is
not
warm
enough
for
traveling
on
a
frosty
morning
the
thought
of
his
dinner
jacket
reminded
him
of
his
puzzledom
what
were
emmy
and
himself
doing
in
that
galley
of
a
railway
carriage
when
they
might
have
been
so
much
more
comfortable
in
their
own
beds
in
nunsmere
it
was
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
which
the
sleeping
girl
who
was
causing
him
such
acute
though
cheerfully
borne
discomfort
alone
had
the
key
in
vain
did
he
propound
to
himself
the
theory
that
such
speculation
betokened
an
indelicate
mind
in
vain
did
he
ask
himself
with
unwonted
severity
what
business
it
was
of
his
in
vain
did
he
try
to
hitch
his
thoughts
to
patent
safety
railway
carriages
which
were
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
vain
did
he
try
to
sleep
the
question
haunted
him
so
much
so
that
when
emmy
awoke
and
rubbed
her
eyes
and
in
some
confusion
apologized
for
the
use
to
which
she
had
put
his
shoulder
he
was
almost
ashamed
to
look
her
in
the
face
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
get
to
victoria
emmy
asked
septimus
had
not
thought
of
it
go
back
to
nunsmere
i
suppose
by
the
next
train
unless
you
want
me
no
i
do
want
you
said
emmy
absently
why
should
i
and
she
gazed
stonily
at
the
suburban
murk
of
the
great
city
until
they
reached
victoria
there
a
dejected
cab
with
a
drooping
horse
stood
solitary
on
the
rank
a
depressing
object
emmy
shivered
at
the
sight
i
ca
stand
it
drive
me
to
my
door
i
know
i
a
beast
septimus
dear
but
i
am
grateful
i
am
really
the
cab
received
them
into
its
musty
interior
and
drove
them
through
the
foggy
brown
of
a
london
winter
dawn
unimaginable
cheerlessness
enveloped
them
the
world
wore
an
air
of
disgust
at
having
to
get
up
on
such
a
morning
the
atmosphere
for
thirty
yards
around
them
was
clear
enough
with
the
clearness
of
yellow
consommé
but
ahead
it
stood
thick
like
a
purée
of
bad
vegetables
they
passed
through
belgravia
and
the
houses
gave
an
impression
of
universal
death
and
the
empty
streets
seemed
waiting
for
the
doors
to
open
and
the
mourners
to
issue
forth
the
cab
too
had
something
of
the
sinister
in
that
it
was
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
a
fourpenny
cigar
and
a
sixpenny
bottle
of
scent
which
continued
a
lugubrious
flirtation
and
the
windows
rattled
a
at
last
it
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
emmy
mansions
in
chelsea
she
looked
at
him
very
piteously
like
a
frightened
child
her
pretty
mouth
was
never
strong
but
when
the
corners
drooped
it
was
babyish
she
slipped
her
hand
in
his
do
leave
me
just
yet
it
silly
i
know
but
this
awful
journey
has
taken
everything
out
of
me
every
bit
of
it
has
been
worse
than
the
last
edith
that
my
maid
will
light
a
fire
you
must
get
warm
before
you
start
and
she
make
some
coffee
oh
do
come
you
can
keep
the
cab
but
what
will
your
maid
think
asked
septimus
who
for
all
his
vagueness
had
definite
traditions
as
to
the
proprieties
of
life
what
does
it
matter
what
does
anything
in
this
ghastly
world
matter
frightened
septimus
horribly
frightened
i
dare
go
up
by
myself
oh
come
her
voice
broke
on
the
last
word
saint
anthony
would
have
yielded
also
his
pig
septimus
handed
her
out
of
the
cab
and
telling
the
cabman
to
wait
followed
her
through
the
already
opened
front
door
of
the
mansions
up
to
her
flat
she
let
herself
in
with
her
latchkey
and
showed
him
into
the
turning
on
the
electric
light
as
he
entered
i
go
and
wake
edith
she
said
then
we
can
have
some
breakfast
the
fire
laid
do
you
mind
putting
a
match
to
it
she
disappeared
and
septimus
knelt
down
before
the
grate
and
lit
the
paper
in
a
second
or
two
the
flame
caught
the
wood
and
the
blower
being
down
it
blazed
fiercely
he
spread
his
hands
out
before
it
incurious
of
the
futile
little
room
whose
draperies
and
fripperies
and
inconsiderable
flimsiness
of
furniture
proclaimed
its
owner
intent
only
on
the
elemental
need
of
warmth
he
was
disturbed
by
the
tornadic
entrance
of
emmy
she
not
here
she
exclaimed
tragically
her
baby
face
was
white
and
there
were
dark
shadows
under
the
eyes
which
stared
at
him
with
a
touch
of
madness
she
not
here
perhaps
she
has
gone
out
for
a
walk
septimus
suggested
as
if
london
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
the
air
at
eight
on
a
foggy
morning
but
emmy
heard
him
not
the
dismaying
sense
of
utter
loneliness
smote
her
down
it
was
the
last
straw
edith
on
whom
she
had
staked
all
her
hopes
of
physical
comfort
was
not
there
overstrained
in
body
nerves
and
mind
she
sank
helplessly
in
the
chair
which
septimus
set
out
for
her
before
the
fire
too
exhausted
to
cry
she
began
to
speak
in
a
queer
toneless
voice
i
do
know
what
to
do
edith
could
have
helped
me
i
want
to
get
away
and
hide
i
ca
stay
here
it
the
first
place
zora
will
come
to
she
must
find
me
edith
has
been
through
it
herself
she
would
have
taken
me
somewhere
abroad
or
in
the
country
where
i
could
have
stayed
in
hiding
till
it
was
over
it
was
all
so
sudden
the
news
of
his
marriage
i
was
half
crazy
i
could
make
plans
i
thought
edith
would
help
me
now
she
has
gone
goodness
knows
where
my
god
what
shall
i
do
she
went
on
looking
at
him
haggardly
a
creature
driven
beyond
the
reticence
of
sex
telling
her
inmost
secret
to
a
man
as
if
it
were
a
commonplace
of
trouble
it
did
not
occur
to
her
distraught
mind
that
he
was
a
man
she
spoke
to
herself
without
thought
uttering
the
cry
for
help
that
had
been
pent
within
her
all
that
awful
night
the
puzzledom
of
septimus
grew
unbearable
in
its
intensity
then
suddenly
it
burst
like
a
skyrocket
and
a
blinding
rain
of
fire
enveloped
him
he
stood
paralyzed
with
pain
and
horror
the
sullen
morning
light
diffused
itself
through
the
room
mingling
ironically
with
the
pretty
glow
cast
by
the
electric
globes
while
the
two
forlorn
grotesques
regarded
each
other
unconscious
of
each
other
grotesqueness
the
girl
disheveled
and
haggard
the
man
with
rough
gray
coat
unbuttoned
showing
the
rumpled
evening
dress
her
toque
miserably
awry
his
black
tie
riding
above
his
collar
the
bow
somewhere
behind
his
ear
and
the
tragedy
of
tragedies
of
a
young
girl
life
was
unfolded
my
god
what
am
i
to
do
septimus
stared
at
her
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
in
one
of
them
his
fingers
grasped
a
folded
bit
of
paper
he
drew
it
out
unthinkingly
a
very
dirty
bit
of
paper
in
his
way
he
threw
it
towards
the
fire
but
it
fell
on
the
tiled
hearth
in
moments
of
great
strain
the
mind
seizes
with
pitiful
eagerness
on
the
trivial
emmy
looked
at
the
paper
something
familiar
about
its
shape
struck
her
she
leaned
forward
picked
it
up
and
unfolded
it
this
is
a
check
she
said
in
a
tone
did
you
mean
to
throw
it
away
he
took
it
from
her
and
looking
at
it
realized
that
it
was
clem
check
for
two
hundred
pounds
thanks
said
he
thrusting
it
into
his
overcoat
pocket
then
his
queerly
working
brain
focused
associations
i
know
what
we
can
do
said
he
we
can
go
to
naples
what
good
would
that
be
she
asked
treating
the
preposterous
question
seriously
he
was
taken
aback
by
her
directness
and
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
i
do
know
said
he
the
first
thing
we
must
do
said
emmy
and
her
voice
sounded
in
her
own
ears
like
someone
else
is
to
get
away
from
here
zora
will
be
down
by
the
first
train
after
my
absence
is
discovered
you
quite
see
that
zora
must
find
me
do
you
of
course
said
septimus
blankly
then
he
brightened
you
can
go
to
an
hotel
a
temperance
hotel
in
bloomsbury
wiggleswick
was
telling
me
about
one
the
other
day
a
friend
of
his
burgled
it
and
got
six
years
a
man
called
barkus
but
what
was
the
name
of
the
hotel
ah
that
i
forget
said
septimus
it
had
something
to
do
with
sir
walter
scott
let
me
see
lockhart
no
lockhart
is
a
different
place
it
was
either
the
bride
of
lammermoor
or
yes
he
cried
triumphantly
it
was
the
ravenswood
in
southampton
row
emmy
rose
the
switch
off
onto
the
trivial
piece
of
paper
had
braced
her
unstrung
nerves
for
a
final
effort
that
and
the
terror
of
meeting
zora
you
take
me
there
i
just
put
some
things
together
he
opened
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
on
the
threshold
she
turned
i
believe
god
sent
you
to
nunsmere
common
last
night
she
left
him
and
he
went
back
to
the
fire
and
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
her
words
touched
him
they
also
struck
a
chord
of
memory
his
mind
went
back
to
a
scene
in
undergraduate
days
it
was
the
corn
exchange
at
cambridge
where
the
most
famous
of
all
american
evangelists
was
holding
one
of
a
series
of
revivalist
meetings
the
great
bare
hall
was
packed
with
youths
who
came
some
to
scoff
and
others
to
pray
the
man
in
black
on
the
platform
with
his
homely
phrase
and
to
polite
undergraduate
ears
terrible
yankee
twang
was
talking
vehemently
of
the
trivial
instruments
the
almighty
used
to
effect
his
purposes
moses
rod
for
instance
you
can
imagine
pharaoh
said
he
and
the
echo
of
the
great
voice
came
to
septimus
through
the
years
you
can
imagine
pharaoh
walking
down
the
street
one
day
and
seeing
moses
with
a
great
big
stick
in
his
hand
moses
says
he
are
you
going
am
i
going
says
moses
guess
i
going
to
deliver
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
and
conduct
them
to
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
moses
this
rod
sir
with
this
rod
septimus
remembered
how
this
bit
of
unauthenticated
history
was
greeted
with
derision
by
the
general
and
with
a
shocked
sense
of
propriety
by
the
cultivated
and
young
men
at
the
university
can
be
very
cultivated
indeed
on
occasion
but
the
truth
the
great
preacher
intended
to
convey
had
lingered
at
the
back
of
his
own
mind
and
now
came
out
into
the
light
perhaps
emmy
had
spoken
more
truly
than
she
thought
in
his
simple
heart
he
realized
himself
to
be
the
least
effectual
of
men
apparently
as
unhelpful
towards
a
great
deliverance
as
the
walking
stick
used
by
moses
but
if
god
had
sent
him
to
nunsmere
common
and
destined
him
to
be
the
mean
instrument
of
emmy
deliverance
he
rubbed
the
warm
pipe
bowl
against
his
cheek
and
excogitated
the
matter
in
deep
humility
yes
perhaps
god
had
sent
him
his
religious
belief
was
nebulous
but
up
to
its
degree
of
clarity
it
was
sincere
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
again
in
the
cab
jogging
wearily
across
london
to
southampton
row
and
the
little
empty
with
all
its
vanities
looked
somewhat
ghostly
lit
as
it
was
by
the
day
and
by
the
frivolously
shaded
electric
light
which
they
had
forgotten
to
switch
off
chapter
x
when
septimus
had
seen
emmy
admitted
to
the
ravenswood
hotel
he
stood
on
the
gloomy
pavement
outside
wondering
what
he
should
do
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
belonged
to
a
club
a
grave
decorous
place
where
the
gay
pop
of
a
champagne
cork
had
been
known
to
produce
a
scandalized
silence
in
the
and
where
members
congregated
to
scowl
at
one
another
unworthiness
from
behind
newspapers
a
hansom
conveyed
him
thither
in
the
hall
he
struggled
over
two
telegrams
which
had
caused
him
most
complicated
thought
during
his
drive
the
problem
was
to
ease
mind
and
to
obtain
a
change
of
raiment
without
disclosing
the
whereabouts
of
either
emmy
or
himself
this
he
had
found
no
easy
matter
diplomacy
being
the
art
of
speaking
the
truth
with
intent
to
deceive
and
so
finely
separated
from
sheer
lying
as
to
cause
grave
distress
to
septimus
candid
soul
at
last
after
much
wasting
of
telegraph
forms
he
decided
on
the
following
to
zora
emmy
safe
in
london
so
am
i
do
worry
devotedly
septimus
to
wiggleswick
bring
clothes
and
railway
carriage
diagrams
secretly
to
club
having
dispatched
these
he
went
into
the
and
ordered
breakfast
the
waiters
served
him
in
horrified
silence
a
gaunt
member
breakfasting
a
few
tables
off
asked
for
the
name
of
the
debauchee
and
resolved
to
write
to
the
committee
never
in
the
club
history
had
a
member
breakfasted
in
dress
clothes
and
in
such
disreputably
disheveled
dress
clothes
such
dissolute
mohocks
were
a
and
an
offense
and
the
gaunt
member
who
had
prided
himself
on
going
by
clockwork
all
his
life
felt
his
machinery
in
some
way
dislocated
by
the
spectacle
but
septimus
ate
his
food
unconcernedly
and
afterwards
mounting
to
the
library
threw
himself
into
a
chair
before
the
fire
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
depraved
till
wiggleswick
arrived
with
his
clothes
then
having
effected
an
outward
semblance
of
decency
he
went
to
the
ravenswood
hotel
wiggleswick
he
sent
back
to
nunsmere
emmy
entered
the
prim
where
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
the
picture
of
pretty
misery
her
delicate
cheeks
white
a
hunted
look
in
her
baby
eyes
a
great
pang
of
pity
went
through
the
man
hurting
him
physically
she
gave
him
a
limp
hand
and
sat
down
on
a
sofa
while
he
stood
hesitatingly
before
her
balancing
himself
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
emmy
nodded
have
you
slept
that
a
thing
i
shall
never
do
again
she
said
querulously
how
can
you
ask
if
you
do
sleep
you
get
ill
and
die
said
septimus
so
much
the
better
she
replied
i
wish
i
could
help
you
i
do
wish
i
could
help
you
no
one
can
help
me
least
of
all
you
what
could
a
man
do
in
any
case
and
as
for
you
my
poor
septimus
you
want
as
much
taking
care
of
as
i
do
the
depreciatory
tone
did
not
sting
him
as
it
would
have
done
another
man
for
he
knew
his
incapacity
he
had
also
gone
through
the
memory
of
rod
the
night
before
i
wonder
whether
wiggleswick
could
be
of
any
use
he
said
more
brightly
emmy
laughed
dismally
wiggleswick
to
no
other
mind
but
septimus
could
such
a
suggestion
present
itself
then
what
to
be
done
i
do
know
said
emmy
they
looked
at
each
other
blankly
two
children
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
modern
social
problems
aghast
at
their
powerlessness
to
grapple
with
it
it
is
a
situation
which
wrings
the
souls
of
the
strong
with
an
agony
worse
than
death
it
crushes
the
weak
or
drives
them
mad
and
often
brings
them
fragile
wisps
of
human
semblance
into
the
criminal
dock
shame
disgrace
social
pariahdom
unutterable
pain
to
dear
ones
an
wound
in
fierce
family
pride
a
stain
on
two
generations
an
incurable
malady
of
a
once
blithe
spirit
woe
disaster
and
ruin
such
is
the
punishment
awarded
by
men
and
women
to
her
who
disobeys
the
social
law
and
perhaps
with
equal
lack
of
volition
obeys
the
law
physiological
the
latter
is
generally
considered
the
greater
crime
these
things
passed
through
septimus
mind
his
ignorance
of
the
ways
of
what
is
after
all
an
indifferent
world
exaggerated
them
you
know
what
it
means
he
said
tonelessly
if
i
did
should
i
be
here
he
made
one
last
effort
to
persuade
her
to
take
zora
into
her
confidence
his
nature
abhorred
deceit
to
say
nothing
of
the
high
treason
he
was
committing
a
rudiment
of
common
sense
also
told
him
that
zora
was
natural
helper
and
protector
but
emmy
had
the
obstinacy
of
a
weak
nature
she
would
die
rather
than
zora
should
know
zora
would
never
understand
would
never
forgive
her
the
disgrace
would
kill
her
mother
if
you
love
zora
as
you
say
you
do
you
would
want
to
save
her
pain
said
emmy
finally
so
septimus
was
convinced
but
once
more
what
was
to
be
done
you
had
better
go
away
my
poor
septimus
she
said
bending
forward
listlessly
her
hands
in
her
lap
you
see
you
not
a
bit
of
use
now
if
you
had
been
a
different
sort
of
man
like
anyone
else
one
who
could
have
helped
me
i
should
have
told
you
anything
about
it
i
send
for
my
old
dresser
at
the
theater
i
must
have
a
woman
you
see
so
you
had
better
go
away
septimus
walked
up
and
down
the
room
deep
in
thought
a
lady
in
a
cheap
blouse
and
skirt
an
inmate
of
the
caravanserai
put
her
head
through
the
door
and
with
a
disapproving
sniff
at
the
occupants
retired
at
length
septimus
broke
the
silence
you
said
last
night
that
you
believed
god
sent
me
to
you
i
believe
so
too
so
i
not
going
to
leave
you
but
what
can
you
do
asked
emmy
ending
the
sentence
on
a
hysterical
note
which
brought
tears
and
a
fit
of
sobbing
she
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
on
the
and
her
young
shoulders
shook
convulsively
she
was
an
odd
mixture
of
bravado
and
baby
helplessness
to
leave
her
to
fight
her
terrible
battle
with
the
aid
only
of
a
theater
dresser
was
an
impossibility
septimus
looked
at
her
with
mournful
eyes
hating
his
futility
of
what
use
was
he
to
any
being
another
man
strong
and
capable
any
vital
fellow
that
was
passing
along
southampton
row
at
that
moment
would
have
known
how
to
take
her
cares
on
his
broad
shoulders
and
ordain
with
kind
imperiousness
a
course
of
action
but
he
he
could
only
clutch
his
fingers
nervously
and
shuffle
with
his
feet
which
of
itself
must
irritate
a
woman
with
nerves
on
edge
he
could
do
nothing
he
could
suggest
nothing
save
that
he
should
follow
her
about
like
a
sympathetic
spaniel
it
was
maddening
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
unexhilarating
street
all
that
was
man
in
him
in
revolt
against
his
ineffectuality
suddenly
came
the
flash
of
inspiration
swift
illuminating
such
as
happened
sometimes
when
the
idea
of
a
invention
burst
upon
him
with
bewildering
clearness
but
this
time
more
radiant
more
intense
than
he
had
ever
known
before
it
was
almost
an
ecstasy
he
passed
both
hands
feverishly
through
his
hair
till
it
could
stand
no
higher
i
have
it
he
cried
and
archimedes
could
not
have
uttered
his
famous
word
with
a
greater
thrill
emmy
i
have
it
he
stood
before
her
gibbering
with
inspiration
at
his
cry
she
raised
a
face
and
regarded
him
amazedly
you
have
what
the
solution
it
is
so
simple
so
easy
why
should
we
have
run
away
together
we
did
said
emmy
but
really
to
get
married
married
she
started
bolt
upright
on
the
sofa
the
feminine
ever
on
the
defensive
yes
said
septimus
quickly
do
you
see
if
you
will
go
through
the
form
of
marriage
with
me
oh
just
the
form
you
know
and
we
both
disappear
abroad
somewhere
for
a
year
i
in
one
place
and
you
in
another
if
you
like
then
we
can
come
back
to
zora
nominally
married
and
and
and
what
asked
emmy
stonily
and
then
you
can
say
you
ca
live
with
me
any
longer
you
could
stand
me
i
do
think
any
woman
could
only
wiggleswick
could
put
up
with
my
ways
emmy
passed
her
hands
across
her
eyes
she
was
somewhat
dazed
you
would
give
me
your
name
and
shield
me
just
like
that
her
voice
quavered
it
is
much
to
give
it
so
short
he
remarked
absently
i
always
thought
it
such
a
silly
name
you
would
tie
yourself
for
life
to
a
girl
who
has
disgraced
herself
just
for
the
sake
of
shielding
her
why
it
done
every
day
said
septimus
is
it
oh
god
you
poor
innocent
and
she
broke
down
again
there
there
said
septimus
kindly
patting
her
shoulder
it
all
settled
is
it
we
can
get
married
by
special
license
quite
soon
read
of
it
in
books
perhaps
the
hall
porter
can
tell
me
where
to
get
one
hall
porters
know
everything
then
we
can
write
to
zora
and
tell
her
it
was
a
runaway
match
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
i
go
and
see
after
it
now
he
left
her
prostrate
on
the
sofa
her
heart
stone
cold
her
body
lapped
in
flame
from
feet
to
hair
it
was
not
given
to
him
to
know
her
agony
of
humiliation
her
agony
of
temptation
he
had
but
followed
the
message
which
his
simple
faith
took
to
be
divine
the
trivial
name
of
dix
would
be
the
instrument
wherewith
the
deliverance
of
emmy
from
the
house
of
bondage
should
be
effected
he
went
out
cheerily
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
hall
porter
vaguely
associating
him
with
the
matter
in
hand
but
forgetting
exactly
why
and
strode
into
the
street
feeling
greatly
uplifted
the
men
who
jostled
him
as
he
pursued
his
and
therefore
devious
course
no
longer
appeared
potential
champions
to
be
greatly
envied
he
felt
that
he
was
one
of
them
and
blessed
them
as
they
jostled
him
taking
their
rough
manners
as
a
sign
of
kinship
the
life
of
holborn
swallowed
him
he
felt
glad
who
once
hated
the
dismaying
bustle
his
heart
sang
for
joy
something
had
been
given
him
to
do
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
he
loved
what
more
can
a
man
do
than
lay
down
his
life
for
a
friend
perhaps
he
can
do
a
little
more
for
a
loved
woman
marry
somebody
else
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
loved
zora
deep
down
in
his
heart
too
dwelt
the
idiot
hope
that
the
miracle
of
miracles
might
one
day
happen
he
loved
the
hope
with
a
mother
passionate
love
for
a
deformed
and
imbecile
child
knowing
it
unfit
to
live
among
the
other
healthy
hopes
of
his
conceiving
at
any
rate
he
was
free
to
bring
her
his
daily
tale
of
worship
to
glean
a
look
of
kindness
from
her
clear
eyes
this
was
his
happiness
for
her
sake
he
would
sacrifice
it
for
zora
sake
he
would
marry
emmy
the
heart
of
septimus
was
that
of
a
confident
in
the
righteousness
of
his
quest
the
certainty
had
come
all
at
once
in
the
flash
of
inspiration
besides
was
he
not
carrying
out
zora
wish
he
remembered
her
words
it
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
he
could
give
her
to
become
her
brother
her
real
brother
she
would
approve
and
beyond
all
that
deep
down
also
in
his
heart
he
knew
it
was
the
only
way
the
wise
simple
way
the
practical
children
of
this
world
would
have
weighed
many
things
one
against
the
other
they
would
have
taken
into
account
sentimentally
morally
pharisaically
or
cynically
according
to
their
various
attitudes
towards
life
the
relations
between
emmy
and
mordaunt
prince
which
had
led
to
this
tragic
situation
but
for
septimus
her
sin
scarcely
existed
when
a
man
is
touched
by
an
angel
feather
he
takes
an
angel
view
of
mortal
frailties
he
danced
his
jostled
way
up
holborn
till
the
city
temple
loomed
through
the
brown
air
it
struck
a
chord
of
association
he
halted
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
and
regarded
it
across
the
road
with
a
forefinger
held
up
before
his
nose
as
if
to
assist
memory
it
was
a
church
people
were
apt
to
be
married
in
churches
sometimes
by
special
license
that
was
it
a
special
license
he
had
come
out
to
get
one
but
where
were
they
to
be
obtained
in
a
properly
civilized
country
doubtless
they
would
be
sold
in
shops
like
boots
and
or
even
in
like
dog
licenses
but
septimus
aware
of
the
deficiencies
of
an
incomplete
social
organization
could
do
no
better
than
look
wistfully
up
and
down
the
stream
of
traffic
as
it
roared
and
flashed
and
lumbered
past
a
policeman
stopped
beside
him
he
appeared
so
lost
he
met
the
man
eyes
with
a
gaze
so
questioning
that
the
policeman
paused
want
to
go
anywhere
sir
yes
said
septimus
i
want
to
go
where
i
can
get
a
special
license
to
be
married
do
you
know
no
you
see
said
septimus
confidentially
marriage
has
been
out
of
my
line
but
perhaps
you
have
been
married
and
might
be
able
to
tell
me
look
here
sir
said
the
policeman
eyeing
him
kindly
but
officially
take
my
advice
sir
do
think
of
getting
married
you
go
home
to
your
friends
the
policeman
nodded
knowingly
and
stalked
away
leaving
septimus
perplexed
by
his
utterance
was
he
a
socrates
of
a
constable
with
a
xantippe
at
home
or
did
he
regard
him
as
a
mild
lunatic
at
large
either
solution
was
discouraging
he
turned
and
walked
back
down
holborn
somewhat
dejected
somewhere
in
london
the
air
was
thick
with
special
licenses
but
who
would
direct
his
steps
to
the
desired
spot
on
passing
gray
inn
one
of
his
brilliant
ideas
occurred
to
him
the
inn
suggested
law
the
law
solicitors
who
knew
even
more
about
licenses
than
hall
porters
and
policemen
a
man
he
once
knew
had
left
him
one
day
after
lunch
to
consult
his
solicitors
in
gray
inn
he
entered
the
low
gloomy
gateway
and
accosted
the
porter
are
there
any
solicitors
living
in
the
inn
not
so
many
as
there
was
they
mostly
architects
but
still
heaps
will
you
kindly
direct
me
to
one
the
man
gave
him
two
or
three
addresses
and
he
went
comforted
across
the
square
to
the
east
wing
whose
georgian
mass
merged
without
skyline
into
the
fuliginous
vapor
which
londoners
call
the
sky
the
lights
behind
the
blindless
windows
illuminated
interiors
and
showed
men
bending
over
desks
and
some
near
the
windows
with
their
faces
sharply
cut
in
profile
septimus
wondered
vaguely
whether
any
one
of
those
visible
would
be
his
solicitor
a
member
of
the
first
firm
he
sought
happened
to
be
disengaged
a
benevolent
young
man
wearing
gold
spectacles
who
received
his
request
for
guidance
with
sympathetic
interest
and
unfolded
to
him
the
divers
methods
whereby
british
subjects
could
get
married
all
over
the
world
including
the
high
seas
on
board
one
of
his
majesty
ships
of
the
mercantile
marine
solicitors
are
generally
bursting
with
irrelevant
information
when
however
he
elicited
the
fact
that
one
of
the
parties
had
a
flat
in
london
which
would
technically
prove
the
fifteen
days
residence
he
opened
his
eyes
but
my
dear
sir
unless
you
are
bent
on
a
religious
ceremony
why
not
get
married
at
once
before
the
registrar
of
the
chelsea
district
there
are
two
ways
of
getting
married
before
the
registrar
one
by
certificate
and
one
by
license
by
license
you
can
get
married
after
the
expiration
of
one
whole
day
next
after
the
day
of
the
entry
of
the
notice
of
marriage
that
is
to
say
if
you
give
notice
you
can
get
married
not
the
next
day
but
the
day
after
in
this
way
you
save
the
heavy
special
license
fee
how
does
it
strike
you
it
struck
septimus
as
a
remarkable
suggestion
and
he
admired
the
lawyer
exceedingly
i
suppose
it
really
a
good
and
proper
marriage
he
asked
the
benevolent
young
man
reassured
him
it
would
take
all
the
majesty
of
the
probate
divorce
and
admiralty
division
of
the
high
court
of
justice
to
dissolve
it
septimus
agreed
that
in
these
circumstances
it
must
be
a
capital
marriage
then
the
solicitor
offered
to
see
the
whole
matter
through
and
get
him
married
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
after
which
he
dismissed
him
with
a
professional
blessing
which
cheered
septimus
all
the
way
to
the
ravenswood
hotel
chapter
xi
good
heavens
mother
they
married
cried
zora
staring
at
a
telegram
she
had
just
received
oldrieve
woke
with
a
start
from
her
nap
who
dear
why
emmy
and
septimus
dix
read
it
oldrieve
put
on
her
glasses
with
faltering
fingers
and
read
aloud
the
words
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
foreign
language
septimus
and
i
were
married
this
morning
at
the
chelsea
registrar
we
start
for
paris
by
the
will
let
you
know
our
plans
love
to
mother
from
us
both
emmy
what
does
this
mean
dear
it
means
my
dear
mother
that
they
married
said
zora
but
why
they
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
run
away
to
do
it
in
this
fashion
i
ca
imagine
it
very
terrible
said
oldrieve
it
worse
than
terrible
it
idiotic
said
zora
she
was
mystified
and
being
a
woman
who
hated
mystification
was
angry
her
mother
began
to
cry
it
was
a
disgraceful
thing
before
a
registrar
too
as
soon
as
i
let
her
go
on
the
stage
i
knew
something
dreadful
would
happen
to
her
she
wailed
of
course
dix
is
foolish
and
eccentric
but
i
never
thought
he
could
do
anything
so
irregular
i
have
no
patience
with
him
cried
zora
i
told
him
only
a
short
while
ago
that
both
of
us
would
be
delighted
if
he
married
emmy
they
must
come
back
dear
and
be
married
properly
do
make
them
urged
oldrieve
the
vicar
will
be
so
shocked
and
hurt
and
what
cousin
jane
will
say
when
she
hears
of
it
she
raised
her
mittened
hands
and
let
them
fall
into
her
lap
the
awfulness
of
cousin
jane
indignation
transcended
the
poor
lady
powers
of
description
zora
dismissed
the
vicar
and
cousin
jane
as
persons
of
no
account
the
silly
pair
were
legally
married
and
she
would
see
that
there
was
a
proper
notice
put
in
as
for
bringing
them
back
she
looked
at
the
clock
they
are
on
their
way
now
to
folkestone
it
would
be
any
good
telegraphing
them
to
come
back
and
be
properly
married
in
church
not
the
slightest
said
zora
but
i
do
it
if
you
like
so
the
telegram
was
dispatched
to
septimus
dix
boulogne
boat
folkestone
and
oldrieve
took
a
brighter
view
of
the
situation
we
have
done
what
we
can
at
any
rate
she
said
by
way
of
now
it
so
happened
that
emmy
like
many
another
person
at
their
wits
end
had
given
herself
an
amazing
amount
of
unnecessary
trouble
her
flight
had
not
been
noticed
till
the
maid
had
entered
her
room
at
eight
she
had
obviously
packed
up
some
things
in
a
handbag
obviously
again
she
had
caught
the
train
from
ripstead
as
she
had
done
once
or
twice
before
when
rehearsals
or
other
theatrical
business
had
required
an
early
arrival
in
london
septimus
telegram
had
not
only
allayed
no
apprehension
but
it
had
aroused
a
mild
curiosity
septimus
was
master
of
his
own
actions
his
going
up
to
london
was
no
one
concern
if
he
were
starting
for
the
equator
a
telegram
would
have
been
a
courtesy
but
why
announce
his
arrival
in
london
why
couple
it
with
emmy
and
why
in
the
name
of
guns
and
musical
comedies
should
zora
worry
but
when
she
reflected
that
septimus
did
nothing
according
to
the
orthodox
ways
of
men
she
attributed
the
superfluous
message
to
his
general
infirmity
of
character
smiled
indulgently
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
her
mind
oldrieve
had
nothing
to
dismiss
as
she
had
been
led
to
believe
that
emmy
had
gone
up
to
london
by
the
morning
train
she
only
bewailed
the
flighty
inconsequence
of
modern
young
women
until
she
reflected
that
emmy
father
had
gone
and
come
with
disconcerting
unexpectedness
from
the
day
of
their
wedding
to
that
of
his
death
on
the
horns
of
a
buffalo
whereupon
she
fatalistically
attributed
her
daughter
ways
to
heredity
so
while
the
two
incapables
were
sedulously
covering
up
their
tracks
the
most
placid
indifference
as
to
their
whereabouts
reigned
in
nunsmere
the
telegram
therefore
announcing
their
marriage
found
zora
entirely
unprepared
for
the
news
it
contained
what
a
pitiful
tragedy
lay
behind
the
words
she
was
a
million
miles
from
suspecting
she
walked
with
her
head
above
such
clouds
her
eyes
on
the
stars
taking
little
heed
of
the
happenings
around
her
feet
and
if
the
truth
is
to
be
known
finding
mighty
little
instruction
or
entertainment
in
the
firmament
the
elopement
for
it
was
nothing
more
brought
her
eyes
however
earthwards
why
she
asked
not
realizing
it
to
be
the
most
futile
of
questions
when
applied
to
human
actions
to
every
such
why
there
are
a
myriad
answers
when
a
mysterious
murder
is
committed
everyone
seeks
the
motive
unless
circumstance
unquestionably
provides
the
key
of
the
enigma
who
can
tell
it
may
be
revenge
for
the
foulest
of
wrongs
it
may
be
that
the
assassin
objected
to
the
wart
on
the
other
man
nose
and
there
are
men
to
whom
a
wart
is
a
pelion
of
rank
offense
and
who
believe
themselves
to
cut
it
off
it
may
be
for
worldly
gain
it
may
be
merely
for
amusement
there
is
nothing
so
outrageous
so
grotesque
which
if
the
human
brain
has
conceived
it
the
human
hand
has
not
done
many
a
man
has
taken
a
cab
on
a
sudden
shower
merely
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
unrolling
his
umbrella
and
the
sanest
of
women
has
been
known
to
cheat
a
conductor
of
a
penny
so
as
to
wallow
in
the
gratification
of
a
blessing
when
the
philosopher
asks
the
everlasting
why
he
knows
if
he
be
a
sound
philosopher
and
a
sound
philosopher
is
he
who
is
not
led
into
the
grievous
error
of
taking
his
philosophy
seriously
that
the
question
is
but
the
starting
point
of
the
entertaining
game
of
speculation
to
this
effect
spake
the
literary
man
from
london
when
next
he
met
zora
nunsmere
was
in
a
swarm
of
excitement
and
the
alien
bee
had
perforce
to
buzz
with
the
rest
the
interesting
thing
is
said
he
that
the
thing
has
happened
that
while
the
inhabitants
of
this
smug
village
kept
one
dull
eye
on
the
decalogue
and
another
on
their
neighbors
romance
on
its
rosy
pinions
was
hovering
over
it
two
people
have
gone
the
right
old
way
of
man
and
maid
they
have
defied
the
paralyzing
conventions
of
the
engagement
oh
the
unutterable
humiliating
deadening
period
when
each
young
person
has
to
pass
the
inspection
of
the
other
relations
when
simpering
friends
maddeningly
leave
them
alone
in
and
conservatories
so
that
they
can
hold
each
other
hands
when
they
are
on
probation
our
friends
have
defied
all
this
they
have
defied
the
orange
blossoms
the
rice
the
wedding
presents
the
unpleasant
public
affidavits
the
whole
indecent
paraphernalia
of
an
orthodox
wedding
the
bridal
veil
a
survival
from
the
barbaric
days
when
a
woman
was
bought
and
paid
for
and
a
man
did
know
what
he
had
got
until
he
had
married
her
and
taken
her
home
the
senseless
new
clothes
which
brand
them
immodestly
wherever
they
go
two
people
have
had
the
courage
to
avoid
all
this
to
treat
marriage
as
if
it
really
concerned
themselves
and
not
tom
dick
and
harry
done
it
why
does
matter
all
honor
to
them
he
waved
his
stick
in
the
air
they
had
met
on
the
common
and
the
lame
donkey
who
had
strayed
companionably
near
them
took
to
his
heels
in
fright
even
the
donkey
said
zora
dix
most
intimate
friend
agree
with
you
the
ass
will
agree
with
the
sage
only
in
the
millennium
said
rattenden
but
zora
was
not
satisfied
with
the
professional
philosopher
presentation
of
the
affair
she
sought
wiggleswick
whom
she
found
before
a
blazing
fire
in
the
his
feet
on
the
mantelpiece
smoking
a
havana
cigar
on
her
approach
he
wriggled
to
attention
and
extinguishing
the
cigar
by
means
of
saliva
and
a
horny
thumb
and
forefinger
put
the
stump
into
his
pocket
good
morning
wiggleswick
said
zora
cheerfully
good
morning
said
wiggleswick
you
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
wiggleswick
gave
her
to
understand
that
thanks
to
his
master
angelic
disposition
and
his
own
worthiness
he
always
had
a
good
time
now
that
he
married
there
will
have
to
be
a
few
changes
in
household
arrangements
said
zora
what
changes
there
will
be
a
cook
and
parlor
maid
and
regular
hours
and
a
mistress
to
look
after
things
wiggleswick
put
his
cunning
gray
head
on
one
side
i
sure
they
make
me
very
comfortable
if
they
do
the
work
i
wo
raise
no
manner
of
objection
zora
regarding
the
egoist
with
mingled
admiration
and
vexedness
could
only
say
oh
i
never
raised
no
objection
to
his
marriage
from
the
first
said
wiggleswick
did
he
consult
you
about
it
of
course
he
did
he
replied
with
an
indulgent
smile
while
the
light
of
sportive
fancy
gleamed
behind
his
blear
eyes
he
looks
on
me
as
a
father
he
does
says
he
going
to
be
married
delighted
to
hear
it
sir
says
i
man
needs
a
woman
about
him
says
i
when
did
he
tell
you
this
wiggleswick
searched
his
inventive
memory
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
may
be
so
bold
sir
who
is
the
young
lady
i
asks
miss
emily
oldrieve
says
he
and
i
said
nicer
brighter
prettier
bit
of
goods
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
you
could
pick
up
between
here
and
houndsditch
i
did
say
that
i
tell
you
straight
he
looked
at
her
keenly
to
see
whether
this
expression
of
loyal
admiration
of
his
new
mistress
had
taken
effect
and
then
continued
and
then
he
says
to
me
there
ai
going
to
be
no
grand
wedding
you
know
me
and
i
does
the
outlandish
things
he
does
would
shock
an
should
forget
the
day
says
he
should
lose
the
ring
i
should
marry
the
wrong
party
i
should
forget
to
kiss
the
bridesmaids
lord
knows
what
i
should
do
so
we
going
up
to
london
to
be
married
on
the
and
do
you
say
nothing
to
nobody
so
you
been
in
this
conspiracy
for
a
fortnight
said
zora
severely
and
you
never
thought
it
your
duty
to
stop
him
doing
so
foolish
a
thing
as
getting
married
no
such
a
silly
thing
as
running
away
of
course
i
did
said
wiggleswick
who
went
on
mendaciously
to
explain
that
he
had
used
every
means
in
his
power
to
prevail
on
his
master
to
submit
to
the
orthodox
ceremony
for
the
sake
of
the
family
then
you
might
have
given
me
a
hint
as
to
what
was
going
on
wiggleswick
assumed
a
shocked
expression
and
disobey
my
master
orders
is
orders
i
once
wore
the
queen
uniform
zora
sitting
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
half
steadying
herself
with
her
umbrella
regarded
the
old
man
standing
respectfully
at
attention
before
her
with
a
smile
whose
quizzicality
she
could
not
restrain
the
old
villain
drew
himself
up
in
a
dignified
way
i
do
mean
the
government
uniform
i
had
my
misfortunes
like
anyone
else
i
was
once
in
the
army
in
the
band
dix
told
me
that
you
had
been
in
the
band
said
zora
with
all
her
graciousness
so
as
to
atone
for
the
smile
you
played
that
instrument
in
the
corner
i
did
said
wiggleswick
zora
looked
down
at
the
point
of
her
umbrella
on
the
floor
having
no
reason
to
disbelieve
wiggleswick
circumstantial
though
entirely
fictitious
story
and
having
by
the
smile
put
herself
at
a
disadvantage
she
felt
uncomfortably
routed
your
master
never
told
you
where
he
was
going
or
how
long
he
was
likely
to
be
away
she
asked
my
master
replied
wiggleswick
never
knows
where
he
is
going
that
why
he
wants
a
wife
who
can
tell
him
zora
rose
and
looked
around
her
then
with
a
sweep
of
her
umbrella
indicating
the
general
dustiness
and
untidiness
of
the
room
the
best
thing
you
can
do
said
she
is
to
have
the
house
thoroughly
cleaned
and
put
in
order
they
may
be
back
any
day
i
send
in
a
charwoman
to
help
you
thank
you
said
wiggleswick
somewhat
glumly
although
he
had
lied
volubly
to
her
for
his
own
ends
he
stood
in
awe
of
her
commanding
personality
and
never
dreamed
of
disregarding
her
high
behests
but
he
had
a
moral
disapproval
of
work
he
could
see
no
nobility
in
it
having
done
so
much
enforced
labour
in
his
time
do
you
think
we
need
begin
now
he
asked
anxiously
at
once
said
zora
it
will
take
you
a
month
to
clean
the
place
and
it
will
give
you
something
to
do
she
went
away
femininely
consoled
by
her
exercise
of
authority
a
minor
victory
covering
a
retreat
but
she
still
felt
very
angry
with
septimus
when
clem
sypher
came
down
to
penton
court
for
the
he
treated
the
matter
lightly
he
knew
that
he
was
acceptable
to
your
mother
and
yourself
so
he
has
done
nothing
dishonorable
all
he
wanted
was
your
sister
and
the
absence
of
fuss
i
think
it
sporting
of
him
i
do
truly
and
i
think
you
detestable
cried
zora
there
not
a
single
man
that
can
understand
what
do
you
want
me
to
understand
i
do
know
said
zora
but
you
ought
to
understand
it
a
day
or
two
later
meeting
rattenden
again
she
found
that
he
comprehended
her
too
fully
what
would
have
pleased
you
said
he
would
have
been
to
play
the
to
have
gathered
the
young
couple
in
your
embrace
and
magnanimously
given
them
to
each
other
and
smiled
on
the
happiness
of
which
you
had
been
the
bounteous
dispenser
they
cheated
you
cut
your
part
clean
out
of
the
comedy
and
you
do
like
it
if
i
not
right
will
you
kindly
order
me
out
of
the
room
well
he
asked
after
a
pause
during
which
she
hung
her
head
oh
you
can
stay
she
said
with
a
you
the
kind
of
man
that
always
bets
on
a
certainty
rattenden
was
right
she
was
jealous
of
emmy
for
having
unceremoniously
stolen
her
slave
from
her
service
that
emmy
had
planned
the
whole
conspiracy
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
and
she
was
angry
with
septimus
for
having
been
weak
enough
to
lend
himself
to
such
duplicity
even
when
he
wrote
her
a
dutiful
letter
from
paris
to
the
telegram
he
had
merely
replied
sorry
impossible
full
of
everything
save
emmy
and
their
plans
for
the
future
she
did
not
forgive
him
how
dared
he
consider
himself
fit
to
travel
by
himself
his
own
servant
qualified
his
doings
as
outlandish
they
make
a
terrible
mess
of
their
honeymoon
she
said
to
clem
sypher
they
start
for
rome
and
find
themselves
in
st
petersburg
they
be
just
as
happy
said
sypher
if
i
was
on
my
honeymoon
do
you
think
i
care
where
i
went
well
i
wash
my
hands
of
them
said
zora
with
a
sigh
as
if
bereft
of
dear
responsibilities
no
doubt
they
happy
in
their
own
way
and
that
for
a
long
time
was
the
end
of
the
matter
the
house
cleaned
and
polished
glittered
like
the
instrument
room
of
a
and
no
master
or
mistress
came
to
bestow
on
wiggleswick
toil
the
meed
of
their
approbation
the
old
man
settled
down
again
to
repose
and
the
house
grew
dusty
and
dingy
again
and
dustier
and
dingier
as
the
weeks
went
on
it
has
been
before
stated
that
things
happen
slowly
in
nunsmere
even
the
reawakening
of
zora
nostalgia
for
the
great
world
and
life
and
the
secrets
of
the
earth
but
things
do
happen
there
eventually
and
the
time
came
when
zora
found
herself
once
again
too
big
for
the
little
house
she
missed
emmy
periodical
visits
she
missed
the
regulation
of
septimus
she
missed
her
little
motor
expeditions
with
sypher
who
had
sold
his
car
and
was
about
to
sell
the
kurhaus
kilburn
priory
the
cure
seemed
to
have
transformed
itself
from
his
heart
to
his
nerves
he
talked
of
it
or
so
it
appeared
to
her
with
more
braggadocio
than
enthusiasm

could
converse
of
little
else
it
was
going
to
smash
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
to
the
shreds
of
its
ointment
boxes
the
deepening
vertical
line
between
the
man
brows
she
did
not
notice
nor
did
she
interpret
the
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
claimed
her
help
she
was
tired
of
the
cure
and
the
remedy
and
sypher
fantastic
need
of
her
as
ally
she
wanted
life
real
quivering
human
life
it
was
certainly
not
to
be
found
in
nunsmere
where
faded
lives
were
laid
away
in
lavender
for
sheer
sensations
she
began
to
tolerate
the
cynical
analysis
of
the
literary
man
from
london
she
must
go
forth
on
her
journeyings
again
she
had
already
toyed
with
the
idea
when
with
septimus
aid
she
had
mapped
out
voyages
round
the
world
now
she
must
follow
it
in
strenuous
earnest
the
callenders
had
cabled
her
an
invitation
to
come
out
at
once
to
los
angeles
she
cabled
back
an
acceptance
so
you
going
away
from
me
said
sypher
when
she
announced
her
departure
there
was
a
hint
of
reproach
in
his
voice
which
she
resented
you
told
me
in
monte
carlo
that
i
ought
to
have
a
mission
in
life
i
find
it
here
so
i
going
to
seek
one
in
california
what
happens
in
this
sleepy
hollow
of
a
place
that
a
live
woman
can
concern
herself
with
there
sypher
cure
my
dear
mr
sypher
she
laughed
protestingly
oh
said
he
you
are
helping
it
on
more
than
you
imagine
i
going
through
a
rough
time
but
with
you
behind
me
as
i
told
you
before
i
know
i
shall
win
if
i
turn
my
head
round
when
i
sitting
at
my
desk
i
have
a
kind
of
fleeting
vision
of
you
hovering
over
my
chair
it
puts
heart
and
soul
into
me
and
gives
me
courage
to
make
desperate
ventures
as
i
only
there
in
the
spirit
it
does
matter
whether
the
bodily
i
is
in
nunsmere
or
los
angeles
how
can
i
tell
said
he
with
one
of
his
swift
clear
glances
i
meet
you
in
the
body
every
week
and
carry
back
your
spirit
with
me
zora
middlemist
he
added
abruptly
after
a
pause
i
implore
you
not
to
leave
me
he
leaned
his
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
from
which
septimus
had
knocked
the
little
china
dog
and
looked
down
earnestly
at
her
as
she
sat
on
the
sofa
behind
the
at
her
back
was
the
long
casement
window
and
the
last
gleams
of
the
wintry
sun
caught
her
hair
to
the
visionary
fancy
they
formed
an
aureole
do
go
zora
she
was
silent
for
a
long
long
time
as
if
held
by
the
spell
of
the
pleading
her
face
softened
adorably
and
a
tenderness
came
into
the
eyes
which
he
could
not
see
a
mysterious
power
seemed
to
be
lifting
her
towards
him
it
was
a
new
sensation
pleasurable
like
floating
down
a
stream
with
the
water
murmuring
in
her
ears
then
suddenly
as
if
startled
to
vivid
consciousness
out
of
a
dream
she
awakened
furiously
indignant
why
should
i
go
tell
me
once
and
for
all
why
she
expected
what
any
woman
alive
might
have
expected
save
the
chosen
few
who
have
the
great
gift
of
reading
the
souls
of
the
poet
and
the
visionary
and
clem
sypher
in
his
way
was
both
she
braced
her
nerves
to
hear
the
expected
but
the
poet
and
the
visionary
spoke
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
cure
his
divine
mission
to
spread
the
healing
unguent
over
the
suffering
earth
voices
had
come
to
him
as
they
had
come
to
the
girl
at
domrémy
and
they
had
told
him
that
through
zora
middlemist
and
no
other
was
his
life
mission
to
be
accomplished
to
her
it
was
anticlimax
reaction
forced
a
laugh
against
her
will
she
leaned
back
among
the
sofa
cushions
is
that
all
she
said
and
sypher
did
not
catch
the
significance
of
the
words
you
seem
to
forget
that
the
rôle
of
mascotte
is
not
a
particularly
active
one
it
all
very
well
for
you
but
i
have
to
sit
at
home
and
twirl
my
thumbs
have
you
ever
tried
that
by
way
of
occupation
do
you
think
you
just
a
bit
egotistical
he
relaxed
the
tension
of
his
attitude
with
a
sigh
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
sat
down
i
suppose
i
am
when
a
man
wants
something
with
all
the
strength
of
his
being
and
thinks
of
nothing
else
day
or
night
he
develops
a
colossal
selfishness
it
a
form
of
madness
i
suppose
there
was
a
man
called
bernard
palissy
who
had
it
and
made
everybody
sacrifice
themselves
to
his
idea
i
no
right
to
ask
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
mine
you
have
the
right
of
friendship
said
zora
to
claim
my
interest
in
your
hopes
and
fears
and
that
i
given
you
and
shall
always
give
you
but
beyond
that
as
you
say
you
have
no
right
he
rose
with
a
laugh
i
know
it
as
logical
as
a
proposition
of
euclid
but
all
the
same
i
feel
i
have
a
higher
right
beyond
any
logic
there
are
all
kinds
of
phenomena
in
life
which
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
reason
you
have
convinced
my
reason
that
i
an
egotistical
dreamer
but
nothing
you
can
do
or
say
will
ever
remove
the
craving
for
you
that
i
have
here
and
he
thumped
his
big
chest
like
hunger
when
he
had
gone
zora
thought
over
the
scene
with
more
disturbance
of
mind
than
she
appreciated
she
laughed
to
herself
at
sypher
fantastic
claim
to
give
up
the
great
things
of
the
world
life
itself
for
the
sake
of
a
quack
ointment
it
was
preposterous
sypher
was
as
crazy
as
septimus
perhaps
crazier
for
the
latter
did
not
thump
his
chest
and
inform
her
that
his
guns
or
his
patent
convertible
had
need
of
her
here
decidedly
the
results
of
her
first
excursion
into
the
big
world
had
not
turned
out
satisfactorily
her
delicate
nose
sniffed
at
them
in
disdain
the
sniff
however
was
disappointingly
unconvincing
the
voices
of
contemptible
people
could
not
sound
in
a
woman
ears
like
the
drowsy
murmuring
of
waters
the
insane
little
devil
that
had
visited
her
in
clem
sypher
garden
whispered
her
to
stay
but
had
not
zora
in
the
magnificence
of
her
strong
womanhood
in
the
hunger
of
her
great
soul
to
find
somewhere
in
the
world
a
mission
in
life
a
fulness
of
existence
which
would
accomplish
her
destiny
down
with
the
insane
little
devil
and
all
his
potential
works
zora
laughed
and
recovered
her
serenity
cousin
jane
who
had
had
much
to
write
concerning
the
elopement
was
summoned
and
zora
with
infinite
baggage
in
the
care
of
turner
set
sail
for
california
the
new
world
lay
before
her
with
its
chances
of
real
quivering
human
life
nunsmere
where
nothing
ever
happened
lay
behind
her
she
smiled
graciously
at
sypher
who
saw
her
off
at
waterloo
and
said
nice
things
to
him
about
the
cure
but
before
her
eyes
danced
a
mirage
in
which
clem
sypher
and
his
cure
were
not
visible
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
sypher
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
watched
the
end
buffers
until
they
were
out
of
sight
then
he
turned
and
strode
away
and
his
face
was
that
of
a
man
stricken
with
great
loneliness
chapter
xii
it
never
occurred
to
septimus
that
he
had
done
a
quixotic
thing
in
marrying
emmy
any
more
than
to
pat
himself
on
the
back
for
a
monstrously
clever
fellow
when
he
had
completed
a
new
invention
at
the
door
of
the
registry
office
he
took
off
his
hat
held
out
his
hand
and
said
but
where
are
you
going
emmy
asked
in
dismay
septimus
did
know
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
over
london
and
said
anywhere
emmy
began
to
cry
she
had
passed
most
of
the
morning
in
tears
she
felt
doubly
guilty
now
that
she
had
accepted
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
an
awful
sense
of
loneliness
also
overwhelmed
her
i
did
know
that
you
hated
me
like
that
she
said
good
heavens
he
cried
in
horror
i
do
hate
you
i
only
thought
you
had
no
further
use
for
me
and
i
to
be
left
alone
in
the
street
i
drive
you
anywhere
you
like
said
he
and
then
get
rid
of
me
as
soon
as
possible
oh
i
know
what
you
must
be
feeling
septimus
put
his
hand
under
her
arm
and
led
her
away
in
great
distress
i
thought
you
would
be
able
to
bear
the
sight
of
me
oh
do
be
silly
said
emmy
her
adjuration
was
on
a
higher
plane
of
sentiment
than
expression
it
comforted
septimus
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
anything
except
leave
me
to
myself
at
any
rate
for
the
present
you
see
i
only
you
in
the
world
to
look
to
god
bless
my
soul
said
he
i
suppose
that
so
it
very
alarming
no
one
has
ever
looked
to
me
in
all
my
life
i
wander
barefoot
for
you
all
over
the
earth
but
could
you
find
somebody
else
who
more
used
to
looking
after
people
it
for
your
own
sake
entirely
he
hastened
to
assure
her
i
know
she
said
but
you
see
it
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
any
of
my
friends
especially
after
what
has
happened
she
held
out
her
ungloved
left
hand
how
could
i
explain
you
must
never
explain
he
agreed
sagely
it
would
undo
everything
i
suppose
things
are
easy
after
all
when
you
set
your
mind
on
them
or
get
some
chap
that
knows
everything
to
tell
you
how
to
do
them
and
lots
of
fellows
about
that
know
everything
solicitors
and
so
forth
there
the
man
who
told
me
about
a
registrar
see
how
easy
it
was
where
would
you
like
to
go
anywhere
out
of
england
she
shuddered
take
me
to
paris
first
we
can
go
on
from
there
anywhere
we
like
certainly
said
septimus
and
he
hailed
a
hansom
thus
it
fell
out
that
the
strangely
married
pair
kept
together
during
the
long
months
that
followed
emmy
flat
in
london
had
been
rented
furnished
the
maid
edith
had
vanished
after
the
manner
of
many
of
her
kind
into
ancillary
space
the
theater
and
all
it
signified
to
emmy
became
a
past
dream
her
inner
world
was
tragical
enough
poor
child
her
outer
world
was
septimus
in
paris
as
she
shrank
from
meeting
possible
acquaintances
he
found
her
a
furnished
in
the
boulevard
raspail
while
he
perched
in
a
little
hotel
close
by
the
finding
of
the
was
an
illustration
of
his
newly
invented
optimistic
theory
of
getting
things
done
he
came
back
to
the
hotel
where
he
had
provisionally
lodged
her
and
informed
her
of
his
discovery
she
naturally
asked
him
how
he
had
found
it
a
soldier
told
me
he
said
a
soldier
yes
he
had
great
baggy
red
trousers
and
a
sash
around
his
waist
and
a
short
blue
jacket
braided
with
red
and
a
fez
with
a
tassel
and
a
shaven
head
he
saved
me
from
being
run
over
by
a
cab
emmy
shivered
oh
do
talk
of
it
in
that
calm
way
suppose
you
had
been
killed
i
suppose
the
zouave
would
have
buried
me
he
such
a
helpful
creature
you
know
he
been
in
algiers
he
says
i
ought
to
go
there
his
name
is
hégisippe
cruchot
but
what
about
the
flat
asked
emmy
oh
you
see
i
fell
down
in
front
of
the
cab
and
he
dragged
me
away
and
brushed
me
down
with
a
waiter
napkin
there
was
a
café
within
a
yard
or
two
and
then
i
asked
him
to
have
a
drink
and
gave
him
a
cigarette
he
drank
absinthe
without
water
and
then
i
began
to
explain
to
him
an
idea
for
an
invention
which
occurred
to
me
to
prevent
people
from
being
run
over
by
cabs
and
he
was
quite
interested
i
show
you
you
wo
said
emmy
with
a
laugh
she
had
her
lighter
moments
do
no
such
thing
not
until
you
told
me
about
the
flat
oh
the
flat
said
septimus
in
a
disappointed
tone
as
if
it
were
a
secondary
matter
altogether
i
gave
him
another
absinthe
and
we
became
so
friendly
that
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
a
flat
and
did
in
the
least
know
how
to
set
about
finding
one
it
turned
out
that
there
was
an
vacant
in
the
house
of
which
his
mother
is
concierge
he
took
me
along
to
see
it
and
introduced
me
to
madame
his
mother
he
has
also
got
an
aunt
who
can
cook
i
should
like
to
have
seen
you
talking
to
the
zouave
said
emmy
it
would
have
made
a
pretty
picture
the
two
of
you
hobnobbing
over
a
little
marble
table
it
was
iron
painted
yellow
said
septimus
it
was
a
resplendent
café
i
wonder
what
he
thought
of
you
well
he
introduced
me
to
his
mother
replied
septimus
gravely
whereat
emmy
broke
into
merry
laughter
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
i
taken
the
for
a
month
and
the
aunt
who
can
cook
he
remarked
what
cried
emmy
who
had
not
paid
very
serious
regard
to
the
narrative
without
knowing
anything
at
all
about
it
she
put
on
her
hat
and
insisted
on
driving
there
incontinently
full
of
misgivings
but
she
found
a
house
a
concierge
who
looked
as
if
she
might
be
the
mother
of
twenty
helpful
zouaves
and
an
equally
matronly
and
sister
a
madame
bolivard
the
aunt
aforesaid
who
could
cook
thus
as
the
ravens
fed
elijah
so
did
zouaves
and
other
casual
fowl
aid
septimus
on
his
way
madame
bolivard
in
particular
took
them
both
under
her
ample
wing
to
the
girl
unspeakable
comfort
a
madame
bolivard
who
not
only
could
cook
but
could
darn
stockings
and
mend
linen
which
emmy
frivolous
fingers
had
never
learned
to
accomplish
she
could
also
prescribe
miraculous
for
trivial
ailments
could
tell
the
cards
and
could
converse
volubly
on
any
subject
under
heaven
the
less
she
knew
about
it
the
more
she
had
to
say
which
is
a
great
gift
it
spared
the
girl
many
desolate
and
despairing
hours
it
was
a
lonely
monotonous
life
septimus
she
saw
daily
now
and
then
if
septimus
were
known
to
be
upstairs
hégisippe
cruchot
coming
to
pay
his
filial
respects
to
his
mother
and
his
mother
she
was
from
marseilles
and
her
of
eels
luxuries
which
his
halfpenny
a
day
could
not
provide
would
mount
to
inquire
dutifully
after
his
aunt
and
incidentally
after
the
dame
du
he
was
their
only
visitor
from
the
outside
world
and
as
he
found
a
welcome
and
an
ambrosial
form
of
alcohol
compounded
of
scotch
whiskey
and
maraschino
whose
subtlety
emmy
had
learned
from
an
eminent
london
at
a
supper
party
he
came
as
often
as
his
respectful
ideas
of
propriety
allowed
they
were
quaint
gatherings
these
in
the
stiffly
furnished
little
salon
emmy
and
softly
raimented
lying
indolently
on
the
sofa
amid
a
pile
of
cushions
she
had
sent
septimus
out
to
la
samaritaine
to
buy
some
in
french
furnished
rooms
they
stuff
the
cushions
with
cement
and
he
had
brought
back
a
dozen
in
a
cab
so
that
the
whole
room
heaved
and
swelled
with
them
septimus
with
his
mild
blue
eyes
and
upstanding
hair
looking
like
the
conventional
picture
of
one
who
sees
a
ghost
hégisippe
cruchot
the
outrageousness
of
whose
piratical
kit
contrasted
with
his
suavity
of
manner
sitting
with
military
precision
on
a
chair
and
madame
bolivard
standing
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
her
bare
arms
crossed
above
her
blue
apron
and
watching
the
scene
with
an
air
of
kindly
proprietorship
they
spoke
in
french
for
only
one
word
of
english
had
hégisippe
and
his
aunt
between
them
and
that
being
howdodogoddam
was
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
former
emmy
gave
utterance
now
and
then
to
peculiar
vocables
which
she
had
learned
at
school
and
which
hégisippe
declared
to
be
the
purest
parisian
he
had
ever
heard
an
englishwoman
use
while
septimus
spoke
very
fair
french
indeed
hégisippe
would
twirl
his
little
brown
mustache
he
was
all
brown
skin
and
eyes
and
hair
and
even
the
skull
under
the
hair
and
tell
of
his
military
service
and
of
the
beautiful
sunshine
of
algiers
and
when
his
aunt
was
out
of
the
room
of
his
arcadian
love
affairs
she
served
in
a
wine
shop
in
the
rue
des
when
was
he
going
to
get
married
at
emmy
question
he
laughed
with
a
wave
of
his
cigarette
and
a
clank
of
his
bayonet
against
the
leg
of
the
chair
on
a
sou
a
day
time
enough
for
that
when
he
had
made
his
fortune
his
mother
then
would
doubtless
find
him
a
suitable
wife
with
a
dowry
when
his
military
service
was
over
he
was
going
to
be
a
waiter
when
he
volunteered
this
bit
of
information
emmy
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
this
dashing
swaggering
desperado
of
a
fellow
a
waiter
i
shall
never
understand
this
country
she
cried
when
one
has
good
introductions
and
knows
how
to
comport
oneself
one
makes
much
and
he
rubbed
his
thumb
and
fingers
together
according
to
the
national
code
of
pantomime
and
then
his
hosts
would
tell
him
about
england
and
the
fogs
wherein
he
was
greatly
interested
or
septimus
would
discourse
to
him
of
inventions
the
weak
spot
in
which
his
shrewd
intelligence
generally
managed
to
strike
and
then
septimus
would
run
his
fingers
through
this
hair
and
say
god
bless
my
soul
i
never
thought
of
that
and
emmy
would
laugh
or
else
they
talked
politics
hégisippe
being
a
radical
himself
absolutely
of
the
pope
and
the
priests
to
be
kind
to
one
neighbors
and
act
as
a
good
citizen
summed
up
his
ethical
code
he
was
as
moral
as
any
devout
catholic
what
about
the
girl
in
the
rue
des
asked
emmy
if
i
were
a
good
catholic
i
would
have
two
for
then
i
could
get
absolution
he
cried
gaily
and
laughed
immoderately
at
his
jest
the
days
of
his
visits
were
marked
red
in
emmy
calendar
i
wish
i
were
a
funny
beggar
and
had
lots
of
conversation
like
our
friend
cruchot
and
could
make
you
laugh
said
septimus
one
day
when
the
lay
heavy
on
her
if
you
had
a
sense
of
humor
you
would
be
here
she
replied
with
some
bitterness
septimus
rubbed
his
thin
hands
together
thoughtfully
i
do
know
why
you
should
say
that
said
he
i
never
heard
a
joke
i
did
see
the
point
of
i
rather
good
at
it
if
you
do
see
the
point
of
this
joke
i
ca
explain
it
my
dear
it
has
a
point
the
size
of
a
pyramid
he
nodded
and
looked
dreamily
out
of
the
window
at
the
opposite
houses
sometimes
her
sharp
sayings
hurt
him
but
he
understood
all
in
his
dim
way
and
pardoned
all
he
never
allowed
her
to
see
him
wince
he
stood
so
long
silent
that
emmy
looked
up
anxiously
at
his
face
dreading
the
effect
of
her
words
his
hand
hung
by
his
side
he
was
near
the
sofa
where
she
lay
she
took
it
gently
in
a
revulsion
of
feeling
kissed
it
and
as
he
turned
flung
it
from
her
go
my
dear
go
i
not
fit
to
talk
to
you
yes
go
you
ought
to
be
here
you
ought
to
be
in
england
in
your
comfortable
home
with
wiggleswick
and
your
books
and
inventions
you
too
good
for
me
and
i
hateful
i
know
it
and
it
drives
me
mad
he
took
her
hand
in
his
turn
and
held
it
for
a
second
or
two
in
both
of
his
and
patted
it
kindly
i
go
out
and
buy
something
he
said
when
he
returned
she
was
penitent
and
glad
to
see
him
and
although
he
brought
her
as
a
present
a
hat
a
thing
of
purple
feathers
and
green
velvet
and
roses
in
which
no
woman
would
be
seen
mummified
a
thousand
years
hence
she
neither
laughed
at
it
nor
upbraided
him
but
tried
the
horror
on
before
the
glass
and
smiled
sweetly
while
the
cold
shivers
ran
down
her
back
i
do
want
you
to
say
funny
things
septimus
she
said
reverting
to
the
starting
point
of
the
scene
so
long
as
you
bring
me
such
presents
as
this
it
a
nice
hat
he
admitted
modestly
the
woman
in
the
shop
said
that
very
few
people
could
wear
it
i
so
glad
you
think
i
an
exceptional
woman
she
said
it
the
first
compliment
you
have
ever
paid
me
she
shed
tears
though
over
the
feathers
of
the
hat
before
she
went
to
bed
good
tears
such
as
bring
great
comfort
and
cleanse
the
heart
she
slept
happier
that
night
and
afterwards
whenever
the
devils
entered
her
soul
and
the
pains
of
hell
got
hold
upon
her
she
recalled
the
tears
and
they
became
the
holy
water
of
an
exorcism
septimus
unconscious
of
this
landmark
in
their
curious
wedded
life
passed
tranquil
though
muddled
days
in
his
room
at
the
hôtel
godet
a
gleam
of
sunlight
on
the
glazed
hat
of
an
omnibus
driver
the
stick
of
the
whip
and
the
horse
ear
as
he
was
coming
home
one
day
on
the
put
him
on
the
track
of
a
new
sighting
apparatus
for
a
field
gun
which
he
had
half
invented
some
years
before
the
working
out
of
this
and
the
superintendence
of
the
making
of
the
model
at
some
works
near
vincennes
occupied
much
of
his
time
and
thought
in
matters
appertaining
to
his
passion
he
had
practical
notions
of
procedure
he
would
be
at
a
loss
to
know
where
to
buy
a
and
be
dependent
on
the
ministrations
of
a
postman
or
an
old
woman
in
a
charcoal
shop
but
to
the
place
where
delicate
instruments
could
be
made
he
went
straight
as
instinctively
and
surely
as
a
buffalo
heads
for
water
many
of
his
books
and
papers
had
been
sent
him
from
time
to
time
by
wiggleswick
who
began
to
dread
the
post
the
labor
of
searching
and
packing
and
dispatching
becoming
too
severe
a
tax
on
the
old
villain
leisure
these
lay
in
promiscuous
heaps
about
the
floor
of
his
bedroom
amid
a
river
of
minor
objects
such
as
collars
and
bits
of
india
rubber
and
the
day
before
yesterday
the
de
and
the
dirty
indeterminate
man
in
a
green
baize
apron
who
went
about
raising
casual
dust
with
a
great
feather
broom
at
first
stowed
the
litter
away
daily
with
jackdaw
ingenuity
of
concealment
until
septimus
gave
them
five
francs
each
to
desist
whereupon
they
desisted
with
alacrity
and
the
books
became
the
aforesaid
to
higher
things
his
only
concern
was
the
impossibility
of
repacking
them
when
the
time
should
come
for
him
to
leave
the
hôtel
godet
and
sometimes
the
more
academic
speculation
as
to
what
zora
would
say
should
some
miracle
of
levitation
transport
her
to
the
untidy
chamber
he
could
see
her
radiant
and
commanding
dispelling
chaos
with
the
sweep
of
her
parasol
there
were
few
moments
in
the
day
when
he
did
not
crave
her
presence
it
had
been
warmth
and
sunshine
and
color
to
him
for
so
long
that
now
the
sun
seemed
to
have
disappeared
from
the
sky
leaving
the
earth
a
chill
monochrome
life
was
very
difficult
without
her
she
had
even
withdrawn
from
him
the
love
in
a
sort
of
way
to
which
she
had
confessed
the
goddess
was
angry
at
the
slight
cast
on
her
by
his
secret
marriage
and
she
was
in
california
a
myriad
of
miles
away
she
could
not
have
been
more
remote
had
she
been
in
saturn
when
emmy
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
long
for
wiggleswick
and
the
studious
calm
of
nunsmere
he
said
no
and
he
spoke
truly
for
wherein
lay
the
advantage
of
one
spot
on
the
surface
over
another
if
zora
were
not
the
light
thereof
but
he
kept
his
reason
in
his
heart
they
rarely
spoke
of
zora
of
the
things
that
concerned
emmy
herself
so
deeply
they
never
spoke
at
all
of
her
hopes
and
fears
for
the
future
he
knew
nothing
for
all
that
was
said
between
them
mordaunt
prince
might
have
been
the
figure
of
a
dream
that
had
vanished
into
the
impenetrable
mists
of
dreamland
to
the
girl
he
was
a
ghastly
memory
which
she
strove
to
hide
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
septimus
saw
that
she
suffered
and
went
many
quaint
and
irrelevant
ways
to
alleviate
her
misery
sometimes
they
got
on
her
nerves
more
often
they
made
the
good
tears
come
once
she
was
reading
a
tattered
volume
of
george
eliot
which
she
had
picked
up
during
a
stroll
on
the
quays
and
calling
him
over
to
her
side
pointed
out
a
sentence
dogs
are
the
best
friends
they
are
always
ready
with
their
sympathy
and
they
ask
no
questions
that
like
you
she
said
but
george
eliot
had
never
met
a
man
like
you
poor
thing
so
she
had
to
stick
the
real
thing
down
to
dogs
septimus
reddened
dogs
bark
and
keep
one
from
sleeping
he
said
my
neighbor
at
the
hôtel
godet
has
two
an
ugly
man
with
a
beard
comes
and
takes
them
out
in
a
motor
car
do
you
know
i
thinking
of
growing
a
beard
i
wonder
how
i
should
look
in
it
emmy
laughed
and
caught
his
sleeve
why
wo
you
even
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
wait
till
i
grown
the
beard
and
then
you
can
said
septimus
that
will
be
never
she
retorted
for
if
you
grow
a
beard
you
look
a
horror
like
a
prehistoric
man
and
i
have
anything
to
do
with
you
so
i
never
be
able
to
tell
you
it
would
be
better
so
said
he
they
made
many
plans
for
settling
down
in
some
part
of
rural
france
or
switzerland
they
had
the
map
of
europe
to
choose
from
but
vagueness
and
a
disinclination
for
further
adventure
on
the
part
of
emmy
kept
them
in
paris
the
winter
brightened
into
spring
and
paris
gay
in
lilac
and
sunshine
held
them
in
her
charm
there
were
days
when
they
almost
forgot
and
became
the
companions
of
the
lame
donkey
on
nunsmere
common
a
day
on
the
seine
for
instance
in
a
steamboat
when
the
water
was
miraculously
turned
to
sparkling
wine
and
the
great
masses
of
buildings
were
bathed
in
amber
and
the
domes
of
the
pantheon
and
the
invalides
and
the
cartouches
and
bosses
of
the
pont
alexandre
iii
shone
burnished
gold
there
was
auteuil
with
its
little
restaurants
rustic
trellis
and
creepers
and
its
of
gudgeon
and
dusty
salt
and
cutlery
and
great
yards
of
bread
which
emmy
loved
to
break
with
septimus
like
christmas
crackers
then
afterwards
there
was
the
winding
seine
again
robinson
crusoe
island
in
all
its
greenery
and
st
cloud
with
its
terrace
looking
over
the
valley
to
paris
wrapped
in
an
amethyst
haze
with
here
and
there
a
triumphant
point
of
glory
a
day
also
in
the
woods
of
bas
meudon
alone
beneath
the
trees
when
they
talked
like
children
and
laughed
over
the
luncheon
basket
which
madame
bolivard
had
stuffed
full
of
electrifying
edibles
when
they
lay
on
their
backs
and
looked
dreamily
at
the
sky
through
the
leaves
and
listened
to
the
chirrup
of
insects
awakening
from
winter
and
the
strange
cracklings
and
tiny
voices
of
springtide
and
gave
themselves
up
to
the
general
vibration
of
life
which
accompanies
the
working
of
the
sap
in
the
trees
days
too
in
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
among
the
nursery
maids
and
working
folk
at
cafés
on
the
remoter
boulevards
where
the
kindly
life
of
paris
still
untouched
by
touristdom
passes
up
and
down
and
the
spring
gets
into
the
step
of
youth
and
sparkles
in
a
girl
eyes
at
the
window
even
of
the
in
the
boulevard
raspail
when
the
air
was
startlingly
clear
and
scented
and
brought
the
message
of
spring
from
far
lands
from
the
golden
shores
of
the
mediterranean
from
the
windy
mountain
tops
of
auvergne
from
the
broad
tender
green
fields
of
central
france
from
every
heart
and
tree
and
flower
from
paris
itself
quivering
with
life
at
such
times
they
would
not
talk
both
interpreting
the
message
in
their
own
ways
yet
both
drawn
together
into
a
common
mood
in
which
they
vaguely
felt
that
the
earth
was
still
a
land
of
romance
that
the
mystery
of
rebirth
was
repeating
itself
according
to
unchanging
and
perpetual
law
that
inconsiderable
forlorn
human
atoms
though
they
were
the
law
would
inevitably
affect
them
too
and
cause
new
hopes
new
desires
and
new
happiness
to
bud
and
flower
in
their
hearts
during
these
spring
days
there
began
to
dawn
in
the
girl
soul
a
knowledge
of
the
deeper
meaning
of
things
when
she
first
met
septimus
and
delightedly
regarded
him
as
a
new
toy
she
was
the
fluffy
frivolous
little
animal
of
excellent
breeding
and
half
education
so
common
in
english
country
residential
towns
with
the
little
refinements
somewhat
coarsened
the
little
animalism
somewhat
developed
the
little
brain
somewhat
sharpened
by
her
career
on
the
stage
now
there
were
signs
of
change
a
glimmering
notion
of
the
duty
of
sacrifice
entered
her
head
she
carried
it
out
by
appearing
one
day
when
septimus
was
taking
her
for
a
drive
in
the
monstrous
nightmare
of
a
hat
it
is
not
given
to
breathing
male
to
appreciate
the
effort
it
cost
her
she
said
nothing
neither
did
he
she
sat
for
two
hours
in
the
victoria
enduring
the
tortures
of
the
uglified
watching
him
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
and
waiting
for
a
sign
of
recognition
at
last
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
i
put
this
thing
on
to
please
you
she
said
what
thing
the
hat
you
gave
me
oh
is
that
it
he
murmured
in
his
absent
way
i
so
glad
you
like
it
he
had
never
noticed
it
he
had
scarcely
recognized
it
it
had
given
him
no
pleasure
she
had
made
of
herself
a
sight
for
gods
and
men
to
no
earthly
purpose
all
her
sacrifice
had
been
in
vain
it
was
then
that
she
really
experienced
the
disciplinary
irony
of
existence
she
never
wore
the
hat
again
wherein
she
was
blameless
the
spring
deepened
into
summer
and
they
stayed
on
in
the
boulevard
raspail
until
they
gave
up
making
plans
paris
baked
in
the
sun
and
theaters
perished
and
riders
disappeared
from
the
acacias
and
brakes
replaced
the
flashing
carriages
in
the
grand
avenue
des
champs
elysées
and
the
great
language
resounded
from
the
place
de
la
bastille
to
the
bon
marché
the
cab
horses
drooped
as
if
drugged
by
the
vapor
of
the
melting
asphalt
beneath
their
noses
men
and
women
sat
by
doorways
in
front
of
little
shops
on
the
benches
in
wide
thoroughfares
the
latin
quarter
blazed
in
silence
and
the
gates
of
the
great
schools
were
shut
the
merchants
of
lemonade
wheeled
their
tin
vessels
through
the
streets
and
the
bottles
crowned
with
lemons
looked
pleasant
to
hot
eyes
for
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
leaves
of
trees
and
the
lips
of
men
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
of
spring
promise
septimus
was
sitting
with
hégisippe
cruchot
outside
the
little
café
of
the
iron
tables
painted
yellow
where
first
they
had
consorted
said

you
are
one
of
the
phenomena
that
make
me
believe
in
the
if
you
had
dragged
me
from
under
the
wheels
of
the
cab
i
should
have
been
killed
and
if
i
had
been
killed
you
would
have
introduced
me
to
your
aunt
who
can
cook
and
what
i
should
have
done
without
your

heaven
only

hégisippe
cruchot
laughed
and
twirled
his
little
brows
mustache
if
you
think
so
much
of
it
said
he
you
can
acquit
your
debt
in
full
by
offering
me
another
absinthe
to
drink
the
health
of
the
three
why
of
course
said
septimus
hégisippe
who
was
sitting
next
the
door
twisted
his
head
round
and
shouted
his
order
to
those
within
it
was
a
very
modest
little
café
in
fact
it
was
not
a
café
at
all
but
a
des
with
a
zinc
counter
inside
and
a
couple
of
iron
tables
outside
on
the
pavement
to
convey
the
air
of
a
septimus
with
his
genius
for
the
inharmonious
drank
tea
not
as
the
elegant
nowadays
drink
at
colombin
or
rumpelmayer
but
a
dirty
gray
liquid
served
with
rum
according
to
the
old
french
fashion
before
became
a
verb
in
the
language
when
people
ask
for
tea
at
a
des
the
teapot
has
to
be
hunted
up
from
goodness
knows
where
and
as
for
the
tea
septimus
however
sipped
the
decoction
of
the
dust
of
ages
with
his
usual
placidity
he
had
poured
himself
out
a
second
cup
and
was
emptying
into
it
the
remainder
of
the
carafe
of
rum
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
toast
as
soon
as
hégisippe
had
prepared
his
absinthe
when
a
familiar
voice
behind
him
caused
him
to
start
and
drop
the
carafe
itself
into
the
teacup
well
i
blessed
said
the
voice
it
was
clem
sypher
large
commanding
pink
and
smiling
the
sight
of
septimus
hobnobbing
with
a
zouave
outside
a
humble
wine
merchant
had
drawn
from
him
the
exclamation
of
surprise
septimus
jumped
to
his
feet
my
dear
fellow
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
wo
you
sit
down
and
join
us
have
a
drink
sypher
took
off
his
gray
homburg
hat
for
a
moment
and
wiped
a
damp
forehead
whew
how
anybody
can
stay
in
paris
this
weather
unless
they
are
obliged
to
is
a
mystery
why
do
you
stay
asked
septimus
i
not
staying
i
passing
through
on
my
way
to
switzerland
to
look
after
the
cure
there
but
i
thought
i
look
you
up
i
was
on
my
way
to
you
i
was
in
nunsmere
last
week
and
took
wiggleswick
by
the
throat
and
choked
your
address
out
of
him
the
hôtel
godet
it
somewhere
about
here
is
it
over
there
said
septimus
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
brought
a
chair
from
the
other
table
do
sit
down
sypher
obeyed
how
the
wife
the
what
asked
septimus
the
wife
mrs
dix
oh
very
well
thank
you
he
said
hurriedly
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
good
friend
monsieur
hégisippe
cruchot
of
the
zouaves
monsieur
cruchot
monsieur
clem
sypher
hégisippe
saluted
and
declared
his
enchantment
according
to
the
manners
of
his
country
sypher
raised
his
hat
politely
of
sypher
cure
friend
of
humanity
do
forget
that
he
said
laughingly
in
french
ce
que
que
ça
asked
hégisippe
turning
to
septimus
septimus
explained
cried
hégisippe
the
light
of
recognition
in
his
eyes
cure
he
made
it
rhyme
with
prayer
but
i
know
that
well
and
it
is
monsieur
who
fabricates
yes
the
friend
of
humanity
what
have
you
used
it
for
for
my
heels
when
they
had
blisters
after
a
long
day
march
the
effect
of
these
words
on
sypher
was
electrical
he
brought
both
hands
down
on
the
table
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
septimus
good
heavens
he
cried
changing
color
it
never
occurred
to
me
what
why
blistered
heels
marching
do
you
see
it
will
cure
the
sore
feet
of
the
armies
of
the
world
it
a
revelation
it
will
be
in
the
knapsack
of
every
soldier
who
goes
to
manoeuvers
or
to
war
it
will
be
a
jolly
sight
more
useful
than
a
marshal
baton
it
will
bring
soothing
comfort
to
millions
of
brave
men
why
did
i
never
think
of
it
i
must
go
round
to
all
the
war
offices
of
the
civilized
globe
it
colossal
it
makes
your
brain
reel
friend
of
humanity
i
shall
be
the
benefactor
of
the
human
race
what
will
you
have
to
drink
asked
septimus
anything
un
he
said
impatiently
obsessed
by
his
new
idea
tell
me
monsieur
cruchot
you
who
have
used
the
it
is
well
known
in
the
french
army
is
it
not
you
had
it
served
out
from
the
regimental
medical
stores
ah
no
monsieur
it
is
my
mother
who
rubbed
it
on
my
heels
sypher
face
expressed
disappointment
but
he
cheered
up
again
immediately
never
mind
it
is
the
idea
that
you
have
given
me
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
monsieur
cruchot
hégisippe
laughed
it
is
to
my
mother
you
should
be
grateful
monsieur
i
should
like
to
present
her
with
a
free
order
for
the
cure
for
life
if
i
knew
where
she
lived
that
is
easy
said
hégisippe
seeing
that
she
is
concierge
in
the
house
where
the
of
monsieur
has
her
her
sypher
turned
sharply
to
septimus
what
that
i
thought
you
lived
at
the
hôtel
godet
of
course
said
septimus
feeling
very
uncomfortable
i
live
in
the
hotel
and
emmy
lives
in
a
flat
she
could
very
well
stay
in
the
hôtel
godet
because
it
is
a
nice
place
for
ladies
there
a
dog
in
the
courtyard
that
howls
i
tried
to
throw
him
some
cold
ham
the
other
morning
about
six
to
stop
him
but
it
hit
a
sort
of
dustman
who
ate
it
and
looked
up
for
more
it
was
very
good
ham
and
i
was
going
to
have
it
for
supper
but
my
dear
man
said
sypher
laying
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
dog
ham
and
dustman
story
are
you
two
living
together
oh
dear
not
said
septimus
in
alarm
and
then
catching
at
the
first
explanation
you
see
our
hours
are
different
sypher
shook
his
head
uncomprehendingly
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
in
dingy
set
down
the
beer
before
him
hégisippe
who
had
mixed
his
absinthe
and
was
waiting
politely
until
their
new
friend
should
be
served
raised
his
glass
just
before
you
came
monsieur
said
he
i
was
about
to
drink
to
the
health
of
interrupted
septimus
reaching
out
his
glass
but
no
laughed
hégisippe
it
was
to
monsieur
madame
et
bébé
bébé
cried
sypher
and
septimus
felt
his
clear
swift
glance
read
his
soul
they
clinked
glasses
hégisippe
defying
the
laws
governing
the
absorption
of
alcohols
tossed
off
his
absinthe
in
swashbuckler
fashion
and
rose
now
i
leave
you
you
have
many
things
to
talk
about
my
respectful
compliments
to
madame
messieurs
au
revoir
he
shook
hands
saluted
and
swaggered
off
his
chechia
at
the
very
back
of
his
head
leaving
half
his
shaven
crown
uncovered
in
front
a
fine
fellow
your
friend
an
intelligent
fellow
said
sypher
watching
him
he
going
to
be
a
waiter
said
septimus
now
that
he
has
had
his
heels
rubbed
with
the
cure
he
may
be
more
ambitious
a
valuable
fellow
for
having
given
me
a
stupendous
idea
but
a
bit
indiscreet
eh
never
mind
he
added
seeing
the
piteous
look
on
septimus
face
i
have
discretion
for
the
two
of
us
i
not
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
anybody
thank
you
said
septimus
there
was
an
awkward
silence
septimus
traced
a
diagram
on
the
table
with
the
spilled
tea
sypher
lighted
a
cigar
which
he
smoked
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
american
fashion
well
i
damned
he
muttered
below
his
breath
he
looked
hard
at
septimus
intent
on
his
tea
drawing
then
he
shifted
his
cigar
impatiently
to
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
no
i
damned
if
i
am
i
ca
be
you
ca
be
what
asked
septimus
catching
his
last
words
damned
why
should
you
be
look
here
said
sypher
i
rushed
in
rather
unceremoniously
into
your
private
affairs
i
sorry
but
i
could
help
taking
an
interest
in
the
two
of
you
both
for
your
own
sake
and
that
of
zora
middlemist
i
suppose
you
would
do
anything
for
her
yes
so
would
i
said
septimus
in
a
low
voice
there
are
some
women
one
lives
for
and
others
one
dies
for
she
is
one
of
the
women
for
whom
one
would
live
septimus
shook
his
head
no
she
the
other
kind
it
much
higher
had
a
lot
of
time
to
think
the
last
few
months
he
continued
after
a
pause
i
had
no
one
but
emmy
and
hégisippe
cruchot
to
talk
to
and
thought
a
great
deal
about
women
they
used
to
come
my
way
and
i
know
anything
at
all
about
them
do
you
now
asked
sypher
with
a
smile
oh
a
great
deal
replied
septimus
seriously
it
astonishing
what
a
lot
of
difference
there
is
between
them
and
between
the
ways
men
approach
different
types
one
woman
a
man
wants
to
take
by
the
hand
and
lead
and
another
he
quite
content
if
she
makes
a
carpet
of
his
body
and
walks
over
it
to
save
her
feet
from
sharp
stones
it
odd
is
it
not
very
said
sypher
who
took
a
more
direct
view
of
things
than
septimus
it
merely
because
he
has
got
a
kindly
feeling
for
one
woman
and
is
desperately
in
love
with
the
other
perhaps
that
it
said
septimus
sypher
again
looked
at
him
sharply
as
a
man
does
who
thinks
he
has
caught
another
man
soul
secret
it
was
only
under
considerable
stress
of
feeling
that
such
coherence
of
ideas
could
have
been
expressed
by
his
irrelevant
friend
what
he
had
learned
the
last
few
minutes
had
been
a
surprise
a
pain
and
a
puzzle
to
him
the
runaway
marriage
held
more
elements
than
he
had
imagined
he
bent
forward
confidentially
you
would
make
a
carpet
of
your
body
for
zora
middlemist
why
of
course
replied
the
other
in
perfect
simplicity
then
my
friend
you
desperately
in
love
with
her
there
was
kindness
help
sympathy
in
the
big
man
voice
and
septimus
though
the
challenge
caused
him
agonies
of
shyness
did
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
resent
sypher
logic
i
suppose
every
man
whom
she
befriends
must
feel
the
same
towards
her
do
you
i
i
different
i
got
a
great
work
to
carry
through
i
could
lie
down
for
anybody
to
walk
over
me
my
work
would
suffer
but
in
this
mission
of
mine
zora
middlemist
is
intimately
involved
i
said
it
when
i
first
saw
her
and
i
said
it
just
before
she
left
for
california
she
is
to
stand
by
my
side
and
help
me
how
god
knows
he
laughed
seeing
the
bewildered
face
of
septimus
who
had
never
heard
of
this
transcendental
connection
of
zora
with
the
spread
of
sypher
cure
you
seem
to
think
i
crazy
not
i
work
everything
on
the
most
hard
and
fast
lines
but
when
a
voice
inside
you
tells
you
a
thing
day
and
night
you
must
believe
it
said
septimus
if
you
had
not
met
her
you
would
have
met
hégisippe
cruchot
and
so
you
would
have
got
the
idea
of
army
blisters
sypher
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
extolled
him
as
a
miracle
of
lucidity
he
explained
magniloquently
it
was
zora
unseen
influence
working
magnetically
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
that
had
led
his
footsteps
towards
the
hôtel
godet
on
that
particular
afternoon
she
had
triumphantly
vindicated
her
assertion
that
geographical
location
of
her
bodily
presence
could
make
no
difference
i
asked
her
to
stay
in
england
you
know
he
remarked
more
simply
seeing
that
septimus
lagged
behind
him
in
his
flight
what
for
why
to
help
me
for
what
other
reason
septimus
took
off
his
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
chair
vacated
by
hégisippe
and
ran
his
fingers
reflectively
up
his
hair
sypher
lit
another
cigar
their
side
of
the
little
street
was
deep
in
shade
but
on
half
the
road
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
the
fierce
afternoon
sunlight
blazed
the
merchant
of
wine
who
had
been
lounging
in
his
dingy
against
the
removed
the
glasses
and
wiped
the
table
clear
of
the
spilled
tea
sypher
ordered
two
more
bocks
for
the
good
of
the
house
while
septimus
still
lost
in
thought
brought
his
hair
to
its
highest
pitch
of
struwel
peterdom
turned
round
to
look
at
them
for
englishmen
do
not
often
sit
outside
a
des
especially
one
with
such
hair
but
are
polite
in
france
and
do
not
salute
the
unfamiliar
with
ribaldry
well
said
sypher
at
last
we
been
speaking
intimately
said
septimus
he
paused
then
proceeded
with
his
usual
diffidence
i
never
spoken
intimately
to
a
man
before
and
i
do
quite
know
how
to
do
it
it
must
be
just
like
asking
a
woman
to
marry
you
but
do
you
think
you
were
selfish
selfish
how
in
asking
zora
middlemist
to
give
up
her
trip
to
california
just
for
the
sake
of
the
cure
it
worth
the
sacrifice
sypher
maintained
to
you
yes
but
it
may
be
so
to
her
but
she
believes
in
the
thing
as
i
do
myself
cried
sypher
why
should
she
any
more
than
i
or
hégisippe
cruchot
if
she
did
she
would
have
stayed
it
would
have
been
her
duty
you
could
expect
a
woman
like
zora
middlemist
to
fail
in
her
duty
could
you
sypher
rubbed
his
eyes
as
if
he
saw
things
mistily
but
they
were
quite
clear
it
was
really
septimus
dix
who
sat
opposite
concentrating
his
discursive
mind
on
sypher
cure
and
implicitly
denying
zora
faith
a
man
in
many
respects
he
would
not
have
scorned
to
learn
wisdom
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
but
out
of
the
mouth
of
septimus
what
wisdom
could
possibly
proceed
he
laughed
his
suggestion
away
somewhat
blusteringly
and
launched
out
again
on
his
panegyric
of
the
cure
but
his
faith
felt
a
quiver
all
through
its
structure
just
as
a
great
building
does
at
the
first
faint
shock
of
earthquake
what
made
you
say
that
about
zora
middlemist
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
i
do
know
replied
septimus
it
seemed
to
be
right
to
say
it
i
know
when
i
get
things
into
my
head
there
appears
to
be
room
for
nothing
else
in
the
world
one
takes
things
for
granted
when
i
was
a
child
my
father
took
it
for
granted
that
i
believed
in
predestination
i
could
but
i
did
not
dare
tell
him
so
so
i
went
about
with
a
load
of
somebody
faith
on
my
shoulders
it
became
intolerable
and
when
my
father
found
out
he
beat
me
he
had
a
bit
of
rope
tied
up
with
twine
at
the
end
for
the
purpose
i
should
like
this
to
happen
to
zora
this
ended
the
discussion
the
landlord
at
his
drew
them
into
talk
about
the
heat
the
emptiness
of
paris
and
the
happy
lot
of
those
who
could
go
into
villeggiatura
in
the
country
the
arrival
of
a
perspiring
cabman
in
a
red
waistcoat
and
glazed
hat
caused
him
to
retire
within
and
administer
to
the
newcomer
needs
one
of
my
reasons
for
looking
you
up
said
sypher
was
to
make
my
apologies
apologies
yes
have
you
thought
about
the
book
on
guns
and
wondered
at
not
hearing
from
me
no
said
septimus
when
i
invented
a
thing
the
interest
has
gone
i
just
invented
a
new
sighting
apparatus
i
show
you
the
model
if
you
come
to
the
hotel
sypher
looked
at
his
watch
and
excused
himself
on
the
ground
of
business
engagements
then
he
had
to
dine
and
start
by
the
nine
train
anyhow
said
he
i
ashamed
at
not
having
done
anything
with
the
guns
i
did
show
the
proofs
to
a
naval
expert
but
he
made
all
sorts
of
criticisms
which
did
help
experts
know
everything
that
is
known
and
do
want
to
know
anything
that
is
so
i
laid
it
aside
it
does
matter
in
the
least
said
septimus
eagerly
and
if
you
want
to
break
the
contract
you
sent
me
i
can
pay
you
back
the
two
hundred
pounds
but
sypher
assured
him
that
he
had
never
broken
a
contract
in
his
life
and
they
shook
hands
and
went
their
respective
ways
septimus
to
the
in
the
boulevard
raspail
and
sypher
thoughtfully
in
the
direction
of
the
luxembourg
he
was
sorry
very
sorry
for
septimus
dix
his
kindness
of
heart
had
not
allowed
him
to
tell
the
brutal
truth
about
the
guns
the
naval
expert
had
scoffed
in
the
free
manner
of
those
who
follow
the
sea
and
declared
the
great
guns
a
mad
inventor
dream
the
admiralty
was
overwhelmed
with
such
things
the
proofs
were
so
much
waste
paper
sypher
had
come
prepared
to
break
the
news
as
gently
as
he
could
but
after
all
their
talk
it
was
not
in
his
heart
to
do
so
and
the
two
hundred
pounds
he
regarded
it
as
money
given
to
a
child
to
play
with
he
would
never
claim
it
he
was
sorry
very
sorry
for
septimus
he
looked
back
along
the
past
year
and
saw
the
devotion
to
zora
middlemist
but
why
did
he
marry
emmy
loving
the
sister
as
he
did
why
live
apart
from
her
having
married
her
and
the
child
it
was
all
a
mystery
in
which
he
did
not
see
clear
he
pitied
the
ineffectuality
of
septimus
with
the
kind
yet
pity
of
the
strong
man
with
a
fine
nature
but
as
for
his
denial
of
zora
faith
he
laughed
it
away
egotistical
yes
zora
had
posed
the
same
question
as
septimus
and
he
had
answered
it
but
her
faith
in
the
cure
itself
his
mission
to
spread
it
far
and
wide
over
the
earth
and
to
save
the
nations
from
vulgar
competitors
who
thought
of
nothing
but
sordid
gain
that
he
felt
sure
remained
unshaken
yet
as
he
walked
along
in
the
alien
though
familiar
city
he
was
smitten
as
with
physical
pain
by
a
craving
for
her
presence
for
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
for
the
greatness
of
sympathy
and
comprehension
that
inhabited
her
generous
and
beautiful
frame
the
need
of
her
was
imperious
he
stopped
at
a
café
on
the
boulevard
called
for
the
wherewithal
to
write
and
like
a
poet
in
the
fine
frenzy
of
inspiration
poured
out
his
soul
to
her
over
the
heels
of
the
armies
of
the
world
he
had
walked
a
great
deal
during
the
day
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
cab
that
evening
at
the
gare
de
lyon
he
felt
an
unfamiliar
stinging
in
his
heel
during
the
process
of
looking
after
his
luggage
and
seeking
his
train
he
limped
about
the
platform
when
he
undressed
for
the
night
in
his
sleeping
compartment
he
found
that
a
ruck
in
his
sock
had
caused
a
large
blister
he
regarded
it
with
superstitious
eyes
and
thought
of
the
armies
of
the
world
hoc
signo
vinces
the
message
had
come
from
heaven
he
took
a
sample
box
of
sypher
cure
from
his
handbag
and
almost
with
reverence
anointed
his
heel
chapter
xiv
clem
sypher
slept
the
sleep
of
the
warrior
preparing
for
battle
when
he
awoke
at
lyons
he
had
all
the
sensations
of
a
wounded
achilles
his
heel
smarted
and
tingled
and
ached
and
every
time
he
turned
over
determined
on
a
continuation
of
slumber
his
foot
seemed
to
occupy
the
whole
width
of
the
berth
he
reanointed
himself
and
settled
down
again
but
wakefulness
had
gripped
him
he
pulled
up
the
blinds
of
the
compartment
and
let
the
dawn
stream
in
and
lying
on
his
back
gave
himself
up
to
the
plans
of
his
new
campaign
the
more
he
thought
out
the
scheme
the
simpler
it
became
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
know
personages
of
high
influence
in
every
capital
in
europe
much
of
his
success
had
already
been
gained
that
way
the
methods
of
introduction
had
concerned
him
but
little
for
social
purposes
they
could
have
been
employed
only
by
a
pushing
upstart
but
in
the
furtherance
of
a
divine
mission
the
apostle
does
not
bind
his
inspired
feet
with
the
shackles
of
ordinary
convention
sypher
rushed
in
therefore
where
the
pachyderms
of
park
lane
would
have
feared
to
tread
just
as
the
fanatical
evangelist
has
no
compunction
in
putting
to
an
entire
stranger
embarrassing
questions
as
to
his
possession
of
the
peace
of
god
so
had
sypher
no
scruple
in
approaching
any
foreigner
of
distinguished
mien
in
an
hotel
lounge
and
converting
him
to
the
religion
of
sypher
cure
in
most
cosmopolitan
resorts
his
burly
figure
and
pink
face
were
well
known
newspapers
paragraphed
his
arrival
and
departure
people
pointed
him
out
to
one
another
in
promenades
distinguished
personages
to
whom
he
had
casually
introduced
himself
introduced
him
to
other
distinguished
personages
when
he
threw
off
the
apostle
and
became
the
man
his
simple
directness
and
charm
of
manner
caused
him
to
be
accepted
pleasurably
for
his
own
sake
had
he
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
his
opportunities
he
might
have
consorted
with
very
grand
folks
indeed
at
a
price
be
it
said
which
his
pride
refused
to
pay
but
he
had
no
social
ambitions
the
grand
folks
therefore
respected
him
and
held
out
a
cordial
hand
as
he
passed
by
that
very
train
was
carrying
to
switzerland
a
russian
grand
duke
who
had
greeted
him
with
a
large
smile
and
a
ce
bon
sypher
on
the
platform
of
the
gare
de
lyon
and
had
presented
him
as
the
friend
of
humanity
to
the
grand
duchess
to
sypher
lying
on
his
back
and
dreaming
of
the
days
when
through
him
the
forced
marches
of
weary
troops
would
become
strolls
along
the
road
the
jealously
guarded
portals
of
the
war
offices
of
the
world
presented
no
terrors
he
ticked
off
the
countries
in
his
mind
until
he
came
to
turkey
whom
did
he
know
in
turkey
he
had
once
given
a
certain
musurus
bey
a
light
for
his
cigarette
in
the
atrium
of
the
casino
at
monte
carlo
but
that
could
scarcely
be
called
an
introduction
no
matter
his
star
was
now
in
the
ascendant
the
lord
would
surely
provide
a
turk
for
him
in
geneva
he
shifted
his
position
in
the
berth
and
a
twinge
of
pain
passed
through
his
foot
hurting
horribly
when
he
rose
to
dress
he
found
some
difficulty
in
putting
on
his
boot
on
leaving
the
train
at
geneva
he
could
scarcely
walk
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
he
anointed
his
heel
again
with
the
cure
and
glad
to
rest
sat
by
the
window
looking
at
the
blue
lake
and
mont
blanc
in
the
quivering
distance
his
leg
supported
on
a
chair
then
his
traveler
who
had
arranged
to
meet
him
by
appointment
was
shown
into
the
room
they
were
to
lunch
together
to
ease
his
foot
sypher
put
on
an
evening
slipper
and
hobbled
downstairs
the
traveler
told
a
depressing
tale
jebusa
jones
had
got
in
everywhere
and
was
underselling
the
cure
a
new
german
skin
remedy
had
insidiously
crept
on
to
the
market
wholesale
houses
wanted
impossible
discounts
and
retail
chemists
could
not
be
inveigled
into
placing
any
but
the
most
insignificant
orders
he
gave
dismaying
details
terribly
anxious
all
the
while
lest
his
chief
should
attribute
to
his
incompetence
the
growing
unpopularity
of
the
cure
but
to
his
amazement
sypher
listened
smilingly
to
his
story
of
disaster
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
all
that
is
nothing
he
cried
a
flea
bite
in
the
ocean
it
will
right
itself
as
the
public
realize
how
they
are
being
taken
in
by
these
american
and
german
impostors
the
cure
ca
fail
and
let
me
tell
you
dennymede
my
son
the
cure
is
going
to
flourish
as
it
has
never
flourished
before
i
got
a
scheme
that
will
take
your
breath
away
the
glow
of
inspiration
in
sypher
blue
eyes
and
the
triumph
written
on
his
resolute
face
brought
the
features
of
the
worried
traveler
for
the
first
time
into
an
expression
of
normal
satisfaction
with
the
world
i
will
stagger
you
to
your
commercial
depths
my
boy
sypher
continued
have
a
drink
first
before
i
tell
you
he
raised
his
champagne
glass
to
sypher
cure
they
drank
the
toast
solemnly
and
then
sypher
unfolded
to
his
subordinate
the
scheme
for
deblistering
the
heels
of
the
armies
of
the
world
dennymede
fired
by
his
enthusiasm
again
lifted
his
brimming
glass
by
god
sir
you
are
a
conqueror
an
alexander
a
hannibal
a
napoleon
there
a
colossal
fortune
in
it
and
it
will
give
me
enough
money
said
sypher
to
advertise
jebusa
jones
and
the
others
off
the
face
of
the
earth
you
need
worry
about
them
sir
when
you
got
the
army
contracts
said
the
traveler
he
could
not
follow
the
spirituality
underlying
his
chief
remark
sypher
laid
down
the
peach
he
was
peeling
and
looked
pityingly
at
dennymede
as
at
one
of
little
faith
one
born
to
the
day
of
small
things
it
will
be
all
the
more
my
duty
to
do
so
said
he
when
the
instruments
are
placed
in
my
hands
what
after
all
is
the
healing
of
a
few
blistered
feet
compared
with
the
scourge
of
leprosy
eczema
itch
psoriasis
and
what
not
and
as
for
the
money
itself
what
is
it
he
preached
his
sermon
the
securing
of
the
world
army
contracts
was
only
a
means
towards
the
shimmering
ideal
it
would
clear
the
path
of
obstacles
and
leave
the
cure
free
to
pursue
its
universal
way
as
the
traveler
finished
his
peach
and
accepted
another
which
his
host
hospitably
selected
for
him
all
the
same
sir
said
he
this
is
the
biggest
thing
you
struck
may
i
ask
how
you
came
to
strike
it
like
all
great
schemes
it
had
humble
beginnings
said
sypher
in
comfortable
postprandial
mood
unconsciously
flattered
by
the
admiration
of
his
subordinate
newton
saw
an
apple
drop
to
the
ground
hence
the
theory
of
gravitation
the
glory
of
tyre
and
sidon
arose
from
the
purple
droppings
of
a
little
dog
mouth
who
had
been
eating
shell
fish
the
great
cunarders
came
out
of
the
lid
of
stephenson
family
kettle
a
soldier
happened
to
tell
me
that
his
mother
had
applied
sypher
cure
to
his
blistered
heels
and
that
was
the
origin
of
the
scheme
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
stretched
out
his
legs
and
put
one
foot
over
the
other
he
immediately
started
back
with
a
cry
of
pain
i
was
forgetting
my
own
infernal
blister
said
he
about
a
square
inch
of
skin
is
off
and
all
the
flesh
round
it
is
as
red
as
a
tomato
you
have
to
be
careful
advised
the
traveler
what
are
you
using
for
it
using
for
it
why
good
heavens
man
the
cure
what
else
he
regarded
dennymede
as
if
he
were
insane
and
dennymede
in
his
confusion
blushed
as
red
as
the
blistered
heel
they
spent
the
afternoon
over
the
reports
and
figures
which
had
so
greatly
depressed
the
traveler
he
left
his
chief
with
hopes
throbbing
in
his
breast
he
had
been
promised
a
high
position
in
the
new
army
contract
department
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
sypher
rubbed
in
more
of
the
cure
he
passed
a
restless
night
in
the
morning
he
found
the
ankle
considerably
swollen
he
could
scarcely
put
his
foot
to
the
ground
he
got
into
bed
again
and
rang
the
bell
for
the
valet
de
chambre
the
valet
entered
sypher
explained
he
had
a
bad
foot
and
wanted
to
see
a
doctor
did
the
valet
know
of
a
good
doctor
the
valet
not
only
knew
of
a
good
doctor
but
an
english
doctor
resident
in
geneva
who
was
always
summoned
to
attend
english
and
american
visitors
at
the
hotel
furthermore
he
was
in
the
hotel
at
that
very
moment
ask
him
if
he
would
kindly
step
up
said
sypher
he
looked
ruefully
at
his
ankle
which
was
about
the
size
of
his
calf
wondering
why
the
cure
had
not
effected
its
advertised
magic
the
inflammation
however
clearly
required
medical
advice
in
the
midst
of
his
ruefulness
the
doctor
a
man
of
five
and
thirty
entered
the
room
he
examined
the
heel
and
ankle
with
professional
scrutiny
then
he
raised
his
head
have
you
been
treating
it
in
any
way
yes
said
sypher
with
the
cure
what
cure
why
sypher
cure
the
doctor
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
edge
of
the
footboard
of
the
bed
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
why
on
earth
do
people
treat
themselves
with
quack
remedies
they
know
nothing
about
quack
remedies
cried
sypher
of
course
they
all
pestilential
and
if
i
had
my
way
i
have
them
stacked
in
the
market
place
and
burned
by
the
common
hangman
but
the
most
pestilential
of
the
lot
is
sypher
cure
you
ought
never
to
have
used
it
sypher
had
the
sensation
of
the
hotel
walls
crashing
down
upon
his
head
falling
across
his
throat
and
weighing
upon
his
chest
for
a
few
instants
he
suffered
a
nightmare
paralysis
then
he
gasped
for
breath
at
last
he
said
very
quietly
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
have
not
the
pleasure
said
the
doctor
they
only
gave
me
your
room
number
i
am
clem
sypher
the
proprietor
of
sypher
cure
the
two
men
stared
at
one
another
sypher
in
a
pyjama
jacket
supporting
himself
by
one
elbow
on
the
bed
the
doctor
at
the
foot
the
doctor
spread
out
his
hands
it
the
most
horrible
moment
of
my
life
i
am
at
your
mercy
i
only
gave
you
my
honest
opinion
the
result
of
my
experience
if
i
had
known
your
name
naturally
you
had
better
go
said
sypher
in
a
queer
voice
digging
the
nails
into
the
palms
of
his
hands
your
fee
there
is
no
question
of
it
i
am
only
grieved
to
the
heart
at
having
wounded
you
good
morning
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
sypher
gave
himself
up
to
his
furious
indignation
this
soothed
the
soul
but
further
inflamed
the
ankle
he
called
up
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
sent
for
the
leading
medical
man
in
geneva
when
he
arrived
he
took
care
to
acquaint
him
with
his
name
and
quality
bourdillot
professor
of
dermatology
in
the
university
of
geneva
made
his
examination
and
shook
a
tactful
head
with
all
consideration
for
the
many
admirable
virtues
of
cure
yet
there
were
certain
maladies
of
the
skin
for
which
he
personally
would
not
prescribe
it
for
this
for
that
he
rattled
off
half
a
dozen
of
learned
diseases
it
might
very
well
be
efficacious
its
effect
would
probably
be
benign
in
a
case
of
elephantiasis
but
in
a
case
of
abrasion
of
the
cuticle
where
there
was
a
large
surface
of
raw
flesh
laid
bare
perhaps
a
simpler
treatment
might
be
more
desirable
his
tone
was
exquisite
and
he
chose
his
language
so
that
not
a
word
could
wound
sypher
listened
to
him
with
a
sinking
heart
in
your
opinion
then
doctor
said
he
it
is
a
good
thing
for
blistered
heels
you
ask
for
my
opinion
replied
the
professor
of
dermatology
at
the
university
of
geneva
i
give
it
you
no
sypher
threw
out
a
hand
desperately
argumentative
but
i
know
of
a
case
in
which
it
has
proved
efficacious
a
zouave
of
my
acquaintance
bourdillot
smiled
a
zouave
just
as
nothing
is
sacred
to
a
sapper
so
is
nothing
hurtful
to
a
zouave
they
have
hides
like
hippopotamuses
those
fellows
you
could
dip
them
in
vitriol
and
they
would
feel
it
so
his
heels
recovered
in
spite
of
the
cure
said
sypher
grimly
evidently
said
bourdillot
sypher
sat
in
his
room
for
a
couple
of
days
his
leg
on
a
chair
and
looked
at
mont
blanc
exquisite
in
its
fairy
splendor
against
the
far
pale
sky
it
brought
him
no
consolation
on
the
contrary
it
reminded
him
of
hannibal
and
other
conquerors
leading
their
footsore
armies
over
the
alps
when
he
allowed
a
despondent
fancy
to
wander
uncontrolled
he
saw
great
multitudes
of
men
staggering
shoeless
along
with
feet
and
ankles
inflamed
to
the
color
of
tomatoes
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
set
his
teeth
dennymede
came
to
visit
him
and
heard
with
dismay
the
verdict
of
science
which
crushed
his
hope
of
a
high
position
in
the
new
army
contract
department
but
sypher
reassured
him
as
to
his
material
welfare
by
increasing
his
commission
on
foreign
sales
whereupon
he
began
to
take
a
practical
view
of
the
situation
we
ca
expect
a
patent
medicine
sir
to
do
everything
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
sypher
it
ca
make
two
legs
grow
where
one
grew
before
but
it
ought
to
cure
blisters
on
the
heel
apparently
it
wo
so
we
are
where
we
were
before
i
met
monsieur
hégisippe
cruchot
the
only
thing
is
that
we
must
now
lead
people
to
suppose
that
it
good
for
blisters
they
must
take
their
chance
said
dennymede
he
was
a
sharp
young
man
with
a
worried
brow
and
a
bilious
complexion
the
soothing
of
the
human
race
with
sypher
balm
of
gilead
mattered
nothing
to
him
his
atrabiliar
temperament
rendered
his
attitude
towards
humanity
rather
misanthropic
than
otherwise
indeed
he
continued
i
do
see
why
you
should
try
for
the
army
contracts
without
referring
specifically
to
sore
feet
said
sypher
i
beg
your
pardon
said
dennymede
who
had
no
latinity
it
means
let
the
buyer
beware
it
up
to
the
buyer
to
see
what
stuff
he
buying
naturally
it
the
first
principle
of
business
sypher
turned
his
swift
clear
glance
on
him
and
banged
the
with
his
hand
it
the
first
principle
of
damned
knavery
and
thieving
he
cried
and
if
i
thought
anyone
ran
my
business
on
it
they
go
out
of
my
employ
at
once
it
at
the
root
of
all
the
corruption
that
exists
in
modern
trade
it
salves
the
conscience
of
the
grocer
who
puts
ground
beans
into
his
coffee
it
a
damnable
principle
he
thumped
the
again
very
angry
the
traveler
hedged
of
course
it
immoral
to
tell
lies
and
say
a
thing
is
what
it
is
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
could
run
a
patent
medicine
on
the
lines
of
warning
the
public
as
to
what
it
is
good
for
you
say
on
the
wrapper
it
will
cure
gout
and
rheumatism
if
a
woman
buys
a
bottle
and
gives
it
to
her
child
who
has
got
scarlet
fever
and
the
child
dies
from
it
it
her
lookout
and
not
yours
when
a
firm
does
issue
a
warning
such
as
wash
clothes
it
a
business
proceeding
for
the
firm
own
protection
well
we
issue
a
warning
cure
blisters
said
sypher
i
advertise
myself
as
the
friend
of
humanity
i
am
according
to
my
lights
if
i
let
poor
fellows
on
the
march
reduce
their
feet
to
this
condition
i
should
be
the
scourge
of
mankind
like
he
snapped
his
fingers
trying
to
recall
the
name
like
atlas
no
it
was
atlas
but
no
matter
not
a
box
of
the
cure
has
been
sold
without
the
guarantee
stamp
of
my
conviction
on
it
the
jebusa
jones
people
are
so
conscientious
said
dennymede
i
bought
a
pot
of
their
stuff
this
morning
they
got
a
new
wrapper
see
he
unfolded
a
piece
of
paper
and
pointed
out
the
place
to
his
chief
they
have
a
special
paragraph
in
large
print
instant
relief
to
blistered
feet
every
mountaineer
should
carry
it
in
his
gripsack
they
the
enemies
of
god
and
man
said
sypher
and
sooner
than
copy
their
methods
i
would
close
down
the
factory
and
never
sell
another
box
as
long
as
i
lived
it
a
thousand
pities
sir
anyhow
said
dennymede
trying
to
work
back
diplomatically
that
the
army
contract
scheme
has
to
be
thrown
overboard
yes
it
a
nuisance
said
sypher
when
he
had
dismissed
the
traveler
he
laughed
grimly
a
nuisance
the
word
was
a
grotesque
anticlimax
he
sat
for
a
long
while
with
his
hands
blinding
his
eyes
trying
to
realize
what
the
abandonment
of
the
scheme
meant
to
him
he
was
a
man
who
faced
his
responsibilities
squarely
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
tried
the
cure
seriously
on
himself
chance
never
having
given
him
cause
before
and
it
had
failed
he
had
heard
the
cure
which
he
regarded
as
a
divine
unction
termed
a
pestilential
quackery
the
words
burned
in
his
brain
he
had
heard
it
depreciated
with
charming
tact
and
courtesy
by
a
great
authority
on
diseases
of
the
skin
one
short
word
no
had
wiped
out
of
existence
his
napoleonic
scheme
for
the
armies
of
the
world
for
putting
them
on
a
sound
footing
he
smiled
bitterly
as
the
incongruous
jest
passed
through
his
mind
he
had
been
fighting
for
months
and
losing
ground
but
this
was
the
first
absolute
check
that
his
faith
had
received
he
staggered
under
it
half
wonderingly
like
a
man
who
has
been
hit
by
an
unseen
hand
and
looks
around
to
see
whence
the
blow
came
why
should
it
come
now
he
looked
back
along
the
years
not
a
breath
of
disparagement
had
touched
the
cure
fair
repute
his
files
in
london
were
full
of
testimonials
honorably
acquired
some
of
these
from
lowly
folk
were
touching
in
their
simple
gratitude
it
is
true
that
his
manager
suggested
that
the
authors
had
sent
them
in
the
hope
of
gain
and
of
seeing
their
photographs
in
the
halfpenny
papers
but
his
manager
shuttleworth
was
a
notorious
and
dismal
cynic
who
believed
in
nothing
save
the
commercial
value
of
the
cure
letters
had
come
with
coroneted
flaps
to
the
envelopes
the
writers
certainly
hoped
neither
for
gain
nor
for
odd
notoriety
he
had
never
paid
a
fee
for
a
testimonial
throughout
his
career
every
one
that
he
printed
was
genuine
and
unsolicited
he
had
been
hailed
as
the
friend
of
humanity
by
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
why
suddenly
should
he
be
branded
as
a
dealer
in
pestilence
his
thought
wandered
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
he
saw
himself
in
the
chemist
shop
in
bury
saint
edmunds
a
little
shop
in
a
little
town
too
small
he
felt
for
the
great
unknown
something
within
him
that
was
craving
for
expansion
the
dull
making
up
of
prescriptions
the
selling
of
tooth
powder
and
babies
feeding
bottles
the
deadly
mechanical
routine
he
remembered
the
daily
revolt
against
it
all
he
remembered
his
discovery
of
the
old
herbalists
his
delight
in
their
quaint
language
the
remedies
so
extraordinary
and
yet
so
simple
his
first
idea
of
combining
these
with
the
orthodox
drugs
of
the
british
pharmacopoeia
his
experiments
his
talks
with
an
aged
man
who
kept
a
dingy
little
shop
of
herbs
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
also
called
a
pestilential
fellow
by
the
medical
faculty
of
the
district
but
a
learned
ancient
all
the
same
who
knew
the
qualities
of
every
herb
that
grew
and
with
some
reeking
mess
of
pulp
was
said
to
have
cured
an
old
woman
malignant
ulcer
given
up
as
incurable
by
the
faculty
he
remembered
the
night
when
the
old
man
grateful
for
the
lad
interest
in
his
learning
gave
him
under
vows
of
secrecy
the
recipe
of
this
healing
emulsion
which
was
to
become
the
basis
of
sypher
cure
in
those
days
his
loneliness
was
cheered
by
a
bulldog
an
ugly
faithful
beast
whom
he
called
barabbas
he
sighed
to
think
how
many
barabbases
had
lived
and
died
since
then
and
who
contracting
mange
became
the
of
many
experiments
first
with
the
old
man
emulsion
then
with
the
emulsion
mixed
with
other
drugs
all
bound
together
in
pure
animal
fat
until
at
last
he
found
a
mixture
which
to
his
joy
made
the
sores
heal
and
the
skin
harden
and
the
hair
sprout
and
barabbas
grow
sleek
as
a
swell
mobsman
in
affluent
circumstances
then
one
day
came
his
grace
of
suffolk
into
the
shop
with
a
story
of
a
pet
of
the
duchess
stricken
with
the
same
disease
sypher
modestly
narrated
his
own
experience
and
gave
the
mighty
man
a
box
of
the
new
ointment
a
fortnight
afterwards
he
returned
not
only
had
it
cured
the
dog
but
it
must
have
charmed
away
the
eczema
on
his
ducal
hands
full
of
a
wild
surmise
he
tried
it
next
on
his
landlady
child
who
had
a
sore
on
its
legs
and
lo
the
sore
healed
it
was
then
that
the
divine
revelation
came
to
him
it
was
then
that
he
passed
his
vigil
as
he
had
told
zora
and
consecrated
himself
and
his
cure
to
the
service
of
humanity
the
steps
the
struggles
the
purchase
of
the
chemist
business
the
early
exploitation
of
the
cure
its
gradual
renown
in
the
district
the
first
whisperings
of
its
fame
abroad
thanks
to
his
grace
of
suffolk
the
early
advertising
the
gradual
growth
the
sale
of
the
chemist
business
the
establishment
of
sypher
cure
as
a
special
business
in
the
town
the
transference
to
london
the
burst
into
fame
all
the
memories
came
back
to
him
as
he
sat
by
the
window
of
the
hôtel
de
and
blinded
his
face
with
his
hands
he
dashed
them
away
at
last
with
a
passionate
gesture
it
ca
be
it
ca
be
he
cried
aloud
as
many
another
man
has
cried
in
the
righteous
rebellion
of
his
heart
against
the
ironical
decrees
of
the
high
gods
whom
his
simple
nature
has
never
suspected
of
their
eternal
and
inscrutable
irony

if
you
travel
on
the
highroad
which
skirts
the
coast
of
normandy
you
may
come
to
a
board
bearing
the
legend
and
a
hand
pointing
down
a
narrow
gorge
if
you
follow
the
direction
and
descend
for
half
a
mile
you
come
to

of

a

as
soon
as
emmy
could
travel
she
implored
septimus
to
find
her
a
quiet
spot
by
the
sea
whither
the
fashionable
do
not
resort
septimus
naturally
consulted
hégisippe
cruchot
hégisippe
asked
for
time
to
consult
his
comrades
he
returned
with
news
of
an
ideal
spot
it
was
a
village
in
the
pyrenees
about
six
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air
and
forty
miles
from
a
railway
station
they
could
shoot
bears
all
day
long
when
emmy
explained
that
a
village
on
the
top
of
the
pyrenees
was
not
by
the
seaside
and
that
neither
she
nor
his
aunt
madame
bolivard
took
any
interest
in
the
destruction
of
bears
he
retired
somewhat
crestfallen
and
went
with
his
difficulties
to
angélique
the
young
lady
in
the
wine
shop
in
the
rue
des
angélique
informed
him
that
a
brave
sailor
on
leave
from
his
torpedo
boat
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
wine
shop
every
evening
he
ought
to
know
something
of
the
sea
a
meeting
was
arranged
by
angélique
between
hégisippe
septimus
and
the
brave
sailor
much
to
emmy
skeptical
amusement
and
the
brave
sailor
after
absorbing
prodigious
quantities
of
alcohol
and
reviewing
all
the
places
on
the
earth
coastline
from
yokohama
to
declared
that
the
veritable
eden
by
the
sea
was
none
other
than
his
native
village
of
he
made
a
plan
of
it
on
the
table
two
square
packets
of
tobacco
representing
the
cliffs
a
pipe
stem
the
road
leading
up
the
gorge
some
tobacco
dust
the
beach
and
some
coffee
slops
applied
with
the
finger
the
english
channel
septimus
came
back
to
emmy
i
have
found
the
place
it
is
it
has
one
hotel
you
can
catch
shrimps
and
its
mussels
are
famous
all
over
the
world
after
consultation
of
a
guide
to
normandy
on
which
emmy
prudence
insisted
they
found
the
brave
sailor
facts
mainly
correct
and
decided
on
i
will
take
you
there
see
that
you
are
comfortably
settled
and
then
come
back
to
paris
said
septimus
you
be
quite
happy
with
madame
bolivard
wo
you
of
course
said
emmy
looking
away
from
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
paris
all
by
yourself
guns
he
replied
then
he
added
reflectively
i
also
do
see
how
i
can
get
out
of
the
hôtel
godet
i
been
there
some
time
and
i
do
know
how
much
to
give
the
servants
in
tips
the
only
thing
is
to
stay
on
emmy
sighed
just
a
bit
wistfully
and
made
no
attempt
to
prove
the
futility
of
his
last
argument
the
wonderfully
sweet
of
life
had
come
to
her
of
late
mingled
with
the
unutterably
bitter
she
was
in
the
state
of
being
when
a
woman
accepts
without
question
septimus
then
went
to
the
lazare
station
to
make
arrangements
and
discovered
an
official
who
knew
a
surprising
amount
about
railway
traveling
and
the
means
of
bringing
a
family
from
domicile
to
station
he
entered
septimus
requirements
in
a
book
and
assured
him
that
at
the
appointed
hour
an
omnibus
would
be
waiting
outside
the
house
in
the
boulevard
raspail
septimus
thought
him
a
person
of
marvelous
intellect
and
gave
him
five
francs
so
the
quaint
quartette
started
in
comfort
septimus
and
emmy
and
madame
bolivard
and
the
little
lump
of
mortality
which
the
frenchwoman
carried
in
her
great
motherly
arms
madame
bolivard
who
had
not
been
out
of
paris
for
twenty
years
needed
all
her
maternal
instincts
to
subdue
her
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
open
country
and
the
sea
in
the
railway
carriage
she
pointed
out
cattle
to
the
unconscious
infant
with
the
tremulous
quiver
of
the
traveler
who
espies
a
herd
of
hippogriffin
is
it
corn
that
monsieur
it
is
beautiful
regard
then
the
corn
my
cherished
one
but
the
cherished
one
cared
not
for
corn
or
cattle
he
preferred
to
fix
his
cold
eyes
on
septimus
as
if
wondering
what
he
was
doing
in
that
galley
now
and
again
septimus
would
bend
forward
and
with
a
vague
notion
of
the
way
to
convey
one
polite
intentions
to
babies
would
prod
him
gingerly
in
the
cheek
and
utter
an
insane
noise
and
then
surreptitiously
wipe
his
finger
on
his
trousers
when
his
mother
took
him
she
had
little
spasms
of
tenderness
during
which
she
pressed
him
tightly
to
her
bosom
and
looked
frightened
the
child
was
precious
to
her
she
had
paid
a
higher
price
than
most
women
and
that
perhaps
enhanced
its
value
at
fécamp
a
rusty
ramshackle
diligence
awaited
them
their
luggage
together
with
baskets
bundles
were
piled
on
top
in
an
amorphous
heap
they
took
their
places
inside
together
with
an
old
priest
and
a
peasant
woman
in
a
great
flapping
cap
the
old
priest
absorbed
snuff
in
great
quantities
and
used
a
red
handkerchief
the
closed
windows
of
the
vehicle
rattled
it
was
very
hot
and
the
antiquated
cushions
smelled
abominably
emmy
tired
of
the
railway
journey
and
suffocated
by
the
heat
felt
inclined
to
cry
this
was
her
first
step
into
her
newly
conditioned
world
and
her
heart
sank
she
regretted
her
comfortable
rooms
in
paris
and
the
conditions
of
existence
there
of
which
septimus
was
an
integral
part
she
had
got
used
to
them
to
his
forced
association
with
the
intimate
details
of
her
life
to
his
bending
over
the
child
like
a
grotesque
fairy
godfather
and
making
astonishing
suggestions
for
its
upbringing
she
had
regarded
him
less
as
a
stranger
to
be
treated
with
feminine
reserve
than
the
doctor
now
it
was
different
she
was
about
to
take
up
her
own
life
again
with
new
responsibilities
and
the
dearly
loved
creature
whom
she
had
bullied
and
laughed
at
and
leaned
on
would
go
away
to
take
up
his
own
queer
way
of
life
and
the
relations
between
them
could
not
possibly
be
the
same
again
the
diligence
was
taking
her
on
the
last
stage
of
her
journey
towards
the
new
conditions
and
it
jolted
and
bumped
and
smelled
and
took
an
interminable
time
i
sure
said
she
woefully
there
no
such
place
as
and
we
are
going
on
forever
to
find
it
presently
septimus
pointed
triumphantly
through
the
window
there
it
is
where
cried
emmy
for
not
a
house
was
in
sight
then
she
saw
the
board
the
old
diligence
turned
and
creaked
and
swung
and
pitched
down
the
gorge
when
they
descended
at
the
hôtel
de
la
plage
the
setting
sun
blazed
on
their
faces
across
the
sea
and
shed
its
golden
enchantment
over
the
little
pebbly
beach
at
that
hour
the
only
living
thing
on
it
was
the
dog
and
he
was
asleep
it
was
a
spot
certainly
to
which
the
fashionable
did
not
resort
it
will
be
good
for
baby
and
for
you
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
is
good
for
one
is
not
always
she
paused
feeling
ungrateful
then
she
added
it
the
best
place
you
could
have
brought
us
to
after
dinner
they
sat
on
the
beach
and
leaned
against
a
it
was
full
moon
the
northern
cliff
cast
its
huge
shadow
out
to
sea
and
half
way
across
the
beach
a
knot
of
fisher
folk
sat
full
in
the
moonlight
on
the
jetty
and
sang
a
song
with
a
mournful
refrain
behind
them
in
the
square
of
yellow
light
of
the
salon
window
could
be
seen
the
figures
of
the
two
english
maiden
ladies
apparently
still
addressing
picture
the
luminous
picture
stood
out
sharp
against
the
dark
mass
of
the
hotel
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
the
sea
lay
like
a
silver
mirror
in
the
windless
air
a
tiny
border
of
surf
broke
on
the
pebbles
emmy
drew
a
long
breath
and
asked
septimus
if
he
smelled
the
seaweed
the
dog
came
and
sniffed
at
their
boots
then
from
the
excellent
leather
judging
them
to
be
persons
above
his
social
station
he
turned
humbly
away
septimus
called
him
made
friends
with
him
he
was
a
smooth
yellow
dog
of
no
account
and
eventually
he
curled
himself
up
between
them
and
went
to
sleep
septimus
smoked
his
pipe
emmy
played
with
the
ear
of
the
dog
and
looked
out
to
sea
it
was
very
peaceful
after
a
while
she
sighed
i
suppose
this
must
be
our
last
evening
together
i
suppose
it
must
said
septimus
are
you
quite
sure
you
can
afford
all
the
money
you
leaving
with
me
of
course
it
comes
out
of
the
bank
i
know
that
you
stupid
she
laughed
where
else
could
it
come
from
unless
you
kept
it
in
a
stocking
but
the
bank
is
an
unlimited
from
which
you
can
draw
out
as
many
handfuls
as
you
want
septimus
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
people
do
get
sovereigns
out
of
i
wish
they
did
they
extract
a
bit
of
gold
about
the
size
of
this
pebble
out
of
a
ton
of
quartz
i
once
bought
shares
in
a
and
there
was
any
gold
in
it
at
all
i
always
used
to
be
buying
things
like
that
people
sold
them
to
me
i
was
like
moses
moses
oh
not
moses
he
could
get
anything
out
of
anything
he
got
water
out
of
a
rock
i
mean
the
son
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
who
bought
the
green
spectacles
oh
said
emmy
who
after
the
way
of
her
generation
had
never
heard
of
him
i
do
do
it
let
people
sell
me
things
any
more
now
he
said
gravely
i
seem
to
have
got
wise
perhaps
it
has
come
through
having
had
to
look
after
you
i
see
things
much
clearer
he
filled
and
lit
another
pipe
and
began
to
talk
about
orion
just
visible
over
the
shoulder
of
the
cliff
emmy
whose
interests
were
for
the
moment
terrestrial
interrupted
him
there
one
thing
i
want
you
to
see
clearly
my
dear
and
that
is
that
i
owe
you
a
frightful
lot
of
money
but
i
sure
to
get
something
to
do
when
i
back
in
london
and
then
i
can
repay
you
by
instalments
remember
not
going
to
rest
until
i
pay
you
back
i
rest
if
you
do
said
septimus
nervously
please
do
talk
of
it
it
hurts
me
i
done
little
enough
in
the
world
god
knows
give
me
this
chance
of
the
buddhists
call
it
merit
this
was
not
a
new
argument
between
them
emmy
had
a
small
income
under
her
father
will
and
the
prospect
of
earning
a
modest
salary
on
the
stage
she
reckoned
that
she
would
have
sufficient
to
provide
for
herself
and
the
child
hitherto
septimus
had
been
her
banker
neither
of
them
had
any
notion
of
the
value
of
money
and
septimus
had
a
child
faith
in
the
magic
of
the
drawn
check
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
measuring
the
portion
of
whisky
he
poured
out
for
a
guest
as
of
counting
the
money
he
advanced
to
emmy
she
took
up
his
last
words
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
as
a
woman
does
when
her
pride
has
gone
from
her
she
said
have
you
acquired
enough
merit
already
my
dear
do
you
see
the
impossibility
of
my
going
on
accepting
things
from
you
you
seem
to
take
it
for
granted
that
you
to
provide
for
me
and
the
child
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
been
a
bad
unprincipled
fool
of
a
girl
i
know
yes
rotten
bad
there
are
thousands
like
me
in
london
septimus
rose
to
his
feet
oh
do
emmy
do
i
ca
stand
it
she
rose
too
and
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
you
must
let
me
speak
our
last
night
before
we
part
it
generous
of
you
not
to
listen
the
yellow
dog
disturbed
in
his
slumbers
shook
himself
and
regarding
them
with
an
air
of
humble
sympathy
turned
and
walked
away
discreetly
into
the
shadow
the
fisher
folk
on
the
jetty
still
sang
their
mournful
chorus
sit
down
again
septimus
yielded
but
why
give
yourself
pain
he
asked
gently
to
ease
my
heart
the
knife
does
good
yes
i
know
i
been
worthless
but
i
not
as
bad
as
that
do
you
see
how
horrible
the
idea
is
to
me
i
must
pay
you
back
the
money
and
of
course
not
come
on
you
for
any
more
you
done
too
much
for
me
already
it
sometimes
stuns
me
to
think
of
it
it
was
only
because
i
was
in
hell
and
mad
and
grasped
at
the
hand
you
held
out
to
me
i
suppose
i
done
you
the
biggest
wrong
a
woman
can
do
a
man
now
i
come
to
my
senses
i
shudder
at
what
i
done
why
why
said
septimus
growing
miserably
unhappy
how
can
you
ever
marry
unless
we
go
through
the
vulgarity
of
a
collusive
divorce
my
dear
girl
said
he
what
woman
would
ever
marry
a
preposterous
lunatic
like
me
there
not
a
woman
living
who
ought
not
to
have
gone
down
on
her
bended
knees
if
she
had
married
you
i
should
never
have
married
said
he
laying
his
hand
for
a
moment
reassuringly
on
hers
who
knows
she
gave
a
slight
laugh
zora
is
only
a
woman
like
the
rest
of
us
why
talk
of
zora
he
said
quickly
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
everything
you
do
suppose
i
do
know
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
it
was
for
her
sake
and
not
for
mine
he
was
about
to
speak
when
she
put
out
her
hand
and
covered
his
mouth
let
me
talk
for
a
little
she
took
up
her
parable
again
and
spoke
very
gently
very
sensibly
the
moonlight
peacefulness
was
in
her
heart
it
softened
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
reflected
itself
in
unfamiliar
speech
i
seem
to
have
grown
twenty
years
older
she
said
she
desired
on
that
night
to
make
her
gratitude
clear
to
him
to
ask
his
pardon
for
past
offenses
she
had
been
like
a
hunted
animal
sometimes
she
had
licked
his
hand
and
sometimes
she
had
scratched
it
she
had
not
been
quite
responsible
sometimes
she
had
tried
to
send
him
away
for
his
own
sake
for
herself
she
had
been
terrified
at
the
thought
of
losing
him
another
man
might
have
done
what
you
did
out
of
chivalry
but
no
other
man
but
you
would
not
have
despised
the
woman
i
deserved
it
but
i
knew
you
did
despise
me
you
have
been
just
the
same
to
me
all
through
as
you
were
in
the
early
days
it
braced
me
up
and
helped
me
to
keep
some
sort
of
that
was
the
chief
reason
why
i
could
not
let
you
go
now
all
is
over
i
am
quite
sane
and
as
happy
as
i
ever
shall
be
after
it
stands
to
reason
we
must
each
lead
our
separate
lives
you
ca
do
anything
more
for
me
and
god
knows
poor
dear
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
so
i
want
to
thank
you
she
put
her
arm
around
his
shoulder
and
kissed
his
cheek
septimus
flushed
her
lips
were
soft
and
her
breath
was
sweet
no
woman
save
his
mother
had
ever
kissed
him
he
turned
and
took
her
hands
let
me
accept
that
in
full
payment
for
everything
you
want
me
to
go
away
happy
do
you
my
dear
she
said
with
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
i
could
do
to
make
you
happy
short
of
throwing
baby
to
a
tiger
i
would
do
it
septimus
took
off
his
cap
and
brought
his
hair
to
its
normal
perpendicularity
emmy
laughed
dear
me
what
are
you
going
to
say
septimus
reflected
for
a
moment
if
i
dine
off
a
bloater
in
a
in
the
or
if
my
bed
is
made
at
six
in
the
evening
and
my
house
is
a
cross
between
a
pigsty
and
an
ironmonger
shop
nobody
minds
it
is
only
septimus
extraordinary
habits
but
if
the
woman
who
is
my
wife
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
yes
yes
i
see
she
said
hurriedly
i
had
looked
at
it
in
that
light
the
boy
is
going
to
cambridge
he
murmured
then
i
should
like
him
to
go
into
parliament
there
are
deuced
clever
fellows
in
parliament
i
met
one
in
venice
two
or
three
years
ago
he
knew
an
awful
lot
of
things
we
spent
an
evening
together
on
the
grand
canal
and
he
talked
all
the
time
most
interestingly
on
the
drainage
system
of
i
wonder
how
fellows
get
to
know
about
drains
emmy
said
would
it
make
you
happy
from
her
tone
he
gathered
that
she
referred
to
the
subject
of
contention
between
them
and
not
to
his
thirst
for
sanitary
information
of
course
it
would
but
how
shall
i
ever
repay
you
perhaps
once
a
year
he
said
you
can
settle
up
in
full
as
you
did
just
now
there
was
a
long
silence
and
then
emmy
remarked
that
it
was
a
heavenly
night
chapter
xvi
in
the
course
of
time
sypher
returned
to
london
to
fight
a
losing
battle
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
derive
whatever
inspiration
he
could
from
zora
letters
he
also
called
dutifully
at
the
nook
during
his
visits
to
penton
court
where
he
found
restfulness
in
the
atmosphere
of
lavender
oldrieve
continued
to
regard
him
as
a
most
superior
person
cousin
jane
as
became
a
gentlewoman
of
breeding
received
him
with
courtesy
but
a
courtesy
marked
by
that
shade
of
reserve
which
is
due
from
a
lady
of
quality
to
the
grandfatherless
if
she
had
not
striven
against
the
unregeneracy
of
mortal
flesh
she
would
have
disapproved
of
him
offhand
because
she
disapproved
of
zora
but
she
was
a
conscientious
woman
and
took
great
pride
in
overcoming
prejudices
she
also
collected
pewter
the
history
of
which
sypher
during
his
years
of
had
once
studied
in
the
confused
notion
that
it
was
culture
all
knowledge
is
good
from
the
theory
of
quaternions
to
the
way
to
cut
a
it
is
sure
to
come
in
useful
somehow
an
authority
on
central
african
dialects
has
been
known
to
find
them
invaluable
in
altercations
with
cabmen
and
a
converted
burglar
has
before
now
become
an
admirable
what
sypher
therefore
had
considered
merely
learned
lumber
in
his
head
cemented
his
friendship
with
cousin
jane
or
rather
to
speak
by
the
book
soldered
it
with
pewter
as
for
the
cure
however
she
did
not
believe
in
it
and
told
him
so
roundly
she
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
in
doctors
the
catechism
the
house
of
lords
the
inequality
of
the
sexes
and
the
oldrieve
family
and
in
that
faith
she
would
live
and
die
sypher
bore
her
no
malice
she
did
not
call
the
cure
pestilential
quackery
he
was
beginning
not
to
despise
the
day
of
small
things
it
may
be
very
good
in
its
way
she
said
just
as
liberalism
and
darwinism
and
eating
in
restaurants
may
be
good
things
but
they
are
not
for
me
cousin
jane
conversation
provided
him
with
much
innocent
entertainment
oldrieve
was
content
to
talk
about
the
weather
and
what
zora
and
emmy
used
to
like
to
eat
when
they
were
little
girls
subjects
interesting
in
themselves
but
not
conducive
to
discussion
cousin
jane
was
nothing
if
not
argumentative
she
held
views
expounded
them
and
maintained
them
nothing
short
of
a
declaration
from
jehovah
bursting
in
glory
through
the
sky
could
have
convinced
her
of
error
even
then
she
would
have
been
annoyed
she
profoundly
disapproved
of
emmy
marriage
to
septimus
whom
she
characterized
as
a
doddering
idiot
sypher
defended
his
friend
warmly
he
also
defended
wiggleswick
at
whose
ways
and
habits
the
good
lady
expressed
unrestrained
indignation
she
could
not
have
spoken
more
disrespectfully
of
antichrist
you
mark
my
words
she
said
he
murder
them
both
in
their
sleep
concerning
zora
too
she
was
emphatic
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
think
every
woman
ought
to
get
married
but
if
she
ca
conduct
herself
decently
without
a
husband
she
ought
to
have
one
but
surely
middlemist
conduct
is
irreproachable
said
sypher
irreproachable
do
you
think
trapesing
about
alone
all
over
the
earth
mixing
with
all
sorts
of
people
she
does
know
from
adam
and
going
goodness
knows
where
and
doing
goodness
knows
what
and
idling
her
life
away
never
putting
a
darn
in
her
stockings
even
is
irreproachable
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
young
woman
of
zora
birth
and
appearance
the
way
she
dresses
must
attract
attention
wherever
she
goes
it
supposed
to
be
nowadays
in
my
time
it
was
immodest
when
a
young
woman
was
forced
to
journey
alone
she
made
herself
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
zora
ought
to
have
a
husband
to
look
after
her
then
she
could
do
as
she
liked
or
as
he
liked
which
would
be
much
the
best
thing
for
her
i
happen
to
be
in
middlemist
confidence
said
sypher
she
has
told
me
many
times
that
she
would
never
marry
again
her
marriage
stuff
and
rubbish
cried
cousin
jane
you
wait
until
the
man
comes
along
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
it
must
be
a
big
strong
man
who
wo
stand
any
nonsense
and
will
take
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shake
her
she
marry
him
fast
enough
we
see
what
happens
to
her
in
california
i
hope
she
wo
marry
one
of
those
dreadful
creatures
with
lassos
said
oldrieve
whose
hazy
ideas
of
california
were
based
on
hazier
memories
of
buffalo
bill
wild
west
show
which
she
had
seen
many
years
ago
in
london
i
hope
middlemist
wo
marry
at
all
said
sypher
in
a
tone
of
alarm
why
asked
cousin
jane
she
shot
the
question
at
him
with
almost
a
snarl
sypher
paused
for
a
moment
or
two
before
replying
i
should
lose
a
friend
said
he
humph
said
cousin
jane
if
the
late
rev
laurence
sterne
had
known
cousin
jane
tristram
shandy
would
have
been
the
richer
by
a
chapter
on
humphs
he
would
have
analyzed
this
particular
one
with
a
minute
delicacy
beyond
the
powers
of
clem
sypher
through
whose
head
rang
the
echo
of
the
irritating
vocable
for
some
time
afterwards
it
meant
something
it
meant
something
uncomfortable
it
was
directly
leveled
at
himself
and
yet
it
seemed
to
sum
up
her
previous
disparaging
remarks
about
zora
what
the
dickens
she
mean
by
it
he
asked
himself
he
came
down
to
nunsmere
every
week
now
having
given
up
his
establishment
at
kilburn
priory
and
sold
the
house
the
kurhaus
as
he
had
named
it
in
his
pride
a
set
of
bachelor
chambers
in
james
sheltered
him
during
his
working
days
in
london
he
had
also
sold
his
for
retrenchment
in
personal
expenses
had
become
necessary
and
the
of
house
and
car
were
needed
for
the
war
of
advertising
which
he
was
waging
against
his
rivals
these
were
days
black
with
anxiety
and
haunting
doubt
illuminated
now
and
then
by
zora
who
wrote
gracious
letters
of
encouragement
he
carried
them
about
with
him
like
talismans
sometimes
he
could
not
realize
that
the
great
business
he
had
created
could
be
on
the
brink
of
failure
the
routine
went
on
as
usual
at
the
works
at
bermondsey
the
same
activity
apparently
prevailed
as
when
the
cure
had
reached
the
of
its
fortune
some
five
years
before
in
the
laboratory
gleaming
with
white
tiles
and
copper
retorts
the
workmen
sorted
and
weighed
and
treated
according
to
the
secret
recipe
the
bundles
of
herbs
that
came
in
every
day
and
were
stacked
in
along
the
walls
in
the
not
so
the
great
vats
of
fat
bubbled
and
ran
giving
out
to
the
the
refined
white
cream
of
which
the
precious
ointment
was
made
beyond
there
was
another
laboratory
vast
and
clean
and
busy
where
the
healing
ichor
of
the
herbs
was
mixed
with
the
drugs
and
the
cream
then
came
the
where
rows
of
girls
filled
the
celluloid
boxes
one
dabbing
in
the
quantity
another
cutting
it
off
clean
to
the
level
of
the
top
with
a
swift
stroke
of
the
spatula
another
fitting
on
the
lid
and
so
on
in
endless
but
fascinating
monotony
until
the
last
girl
placed
on
the
trolley
by
her
side
waiting
to
carry
it
to
the
the
finished
packet
of
sypher
cure
as
it
would
be
delivered
to
the
world
then
there
were
the
full
of
deal
cases
for
despatching
the
cure
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
some
empty
some
being
filled
others
stacked
in
readiness
for
the
carriers
a
babel
of
sounds
of
hammering
clamps
of
creaking
barrows
of
horses
by
the
open
doors
rattling
their
heavy
harness
and
trampling
the
flagstones
with
their
heavy
hoofs
a
ceaseless
rushing
of
brawny
men
in
sackcloth
aprons
of
dusty
men
with
stumps
of
pencils
and
and
crumpled
invoices
counting
and
checking
and
reporting
to
other
men
in
narrow
glass
offices
against
the
wall
outside
stood
the
great
wagons
laden
with
the
white
deal
boxes
bound
with
iron
hoops
and
bearing
in
vermilion
letters
the
inscription
of
sypher
cure
every
detail
of
this
complicated
hive
was
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
kitchen
was
to
his
cook
he
had
planned
it
all
organized
it
all
every
action
of
every
human
creature
in
the
place
from
the
skilled
pharmaceutist
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
the
ointment
to
the
grimy
boy
who
did
odd
jobs
about
the
sheds
had
been
by
him
had
had
its
mainspring
in
his
brain
apart
from
idealistic
aspirations
concerned
with
the
cure
itself
the
perfecting
of
this
machinery
of
human
activity
had
been
a
matter
of
absorbing
interest
its
perfection
a
subject
of
honorable
pride
he
walked
through
the
works
day
after
day
noting
the
familiar
sights
and
sounds
pausing
here
and
there
lovingly
as
a
man
does
in
his
garden
to
touch
some
cherished
plant
or
to
fill
himself
with
the
beauty
of
some
rare
flower
the
place
was
inexpressibly
dear
to
him
that
those
furnaces
should
ever
grow
cold
that
those
vats
should
ever
be
empty
that
those
two
magic
words
should
cease
to
blaze
on
the
wooden
boxes
should
fade
from
the
sight
of
man
that
those
gates
should
ever
be
shut
seemed
to
transcend
imagination
the
factory
had
taken
its
rank
with
eternal
unchanging
things
like
the
solar
system
and
the
bank
of
england
yet
he
knew
only
too
well
that
there
had
been
change
in
the
unchanging
and
in
his
soul
dwelt
a
sickening
certainty
that
the
eternal
would
be
the
transient
gradually
the
staff
had
been
reduced
the
output
lessened
already
two
of
the
long
tables
once
filled
with
girls
stood
forlornly
empty
his
comfortably
appointed
office
in
moorgate
street
told
the
same
story
week
after
week
the
orders
slackened
and
gradually
the
number
of
the
clerks
had
shrunk
gloom
settled
permanently
on
the
manager
brow
he
almost
walked
on
tiptoe
into
sypher
room
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
hushed
whisper
until
rebuked
for
dismalness
if
you
look
like
that
shuttleworth
i
shall
cry
on
another
occasion
shuttleworth
said
we
are
throwing
money
away
on
advertisements
the
concern
ca
stand
it
sypher
turned
blue
pencil
in
hand
from
the
wall
where
draft
proofs
of
advertisements
were
pinned
for
his
correction
and
master
touch
this
was
a
part
of
the
business
that
he
loved
it
appealed
to
the
flamboyant
in
his
nature
it
particularly
pleased
him
to
see
omnibuses
pass
by
bearing
the
famous
sypher
cure
an
enlargement
of
his
own
handwriting
in
streaming
letters
of
blood
we
going
to
double
them
said
he
and
his
air
was
that
of
the
racing
mississippi
captains
of
old
days
who
in
response
to
the
expostulation
of
their
engineers
sent
a
little
nigger
boy
to
sit
on
the
the
dismal
manager
turned
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
with
the
air
of
the
family
steward
in
hogarth
mariage
à
la
mode
he
had
not
his
chief
napoleonic
mind
but
he
had
a
wife
and
a
large
family
clem
sypher
also
thought
of
that
not
only
of
shuttleworth
wife
and
family
but
also
of
the
wives
and
families
of
the
many
men
in
his
employ
it
kept
him
awake
at
nights
in
the
soothing
air
of
nunsmere
however
he
slept
in
long
dead
stretches
as
a
tired
man
sleeps
in
spite
of
trains
which
screeched
past
the
bottom
of
his
lawn
their
furious
unrest
enhanced
the
peace
of
village
things
he
began
to
love
the
little
backwater
of
the
earth
whose
stillness
calmed
the
fever
of
life
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
at
ripstead
a
cool
hand
seemed
to
touch
his
forehead
and
charm
away
the
cares
that
made
his
temples
throb
at
nunsmere
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
simplicities
of
the
place
he
took
to
strolling
like
septimus
about
the
common
and
made
friends
with
the
lame
donkey
on
sunday
mornings
he
went
to
church
he
had
first
found
himself
there
out
of
curiosity
for
though
not
an
irreligious
man
he
was
not
given
to
pious
practices
but
afterwards
he
had
gone
on
account
of
the
restfulness
of
the
rural
service
his
mind
essentially
reverend
took
it
very
seriously
just
as
it
took
seriously
the
works
of
a
great
poet
which
he
could
not
understand
or
any
alien
form
of
human
aspiration
even
the
parish
notices
and
the
publication
of
banns
he
received
with
earnest
attention
his
intensity
of
interest
as
he
listened
to
the
sermon
sometimes
flattered
the
mild
vicar
and
at
other
times
when
thinness
of
argument
pricked
his
conscience
alarmed
him
considerably
but
sypher
would
not
have
dared
enter
into
theological
disputation
he
took
the
sermon
as
he
took
the
hymns
in
which
he
joined
lustily
cousin
jane
whom
he
invariably
met
with
oldrieve
after
the
service
and
escorted
home
had
no
such
scruples
she
tore
the
vicar
theology
into
fragments
and
scattered
them
behind
her
as
she
walked
like
a
hare
in
a
paper
chase
said
the
literary
man
from
london
who
had
strolled
with
them
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
good
lady
one
of
those
women
who
speak
as
if
they
had
a
relation
who
had
married
a
high
official
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
now
and
then
gave
them
confidential
information
sypher
liked
rattenden
because
he
could
often
put
into
a
phrase
his
own
unformulated
ideas
he
also
belonged
to
a
world
to
which
he
himself
was
a
stranger
the
world
of
books
and
plays
and
personalities
and
theories
of
art
sypher
thought
that
its
denizens
lived
on
a
lofty
plane
the
atmosphere
said
rattenden
is
so
rarified
that
the
kettle
refuses
to
boil
properly
that
is
why
we
always
have
cold
tea
at
literary
gatherings
my
dear
fellow
it
a
damned
world
it
talks
all
day
and
does
nothing
all
night
the
ragged
italian
in
front
of
the
fresco
in
his
village
church
or
at
the
back
of
the
gallery
at
the
opera
of
his
town
knows
more
essentials
of
painting
and
music
than
any
of
us
it
a
hollow
sham
of
a
world
filled
with
empty
words
i
love
it
then
why
abuse
it
laughed
sypher
because
it
a
wanton
and
the
wanton
angers
you
and
fascinates
you
at
the
same
time
you
never
know
how
to
take
her
you
are
aware
she
has
got
a
heart
but
her
lips
are
red
she
is
unreal
she
holds
views
in
defiance
of
common
sense
which
is
the
nobler
thing
to
do
to
dig
potatoes
or
paint
a
man
digging
potatoes
she
swears
to
you
that
the
digger
is
a
clod
of
earth
and
the
painter
a
handful
of
heaven
she
is
talking
rot
you
know
it
yet
you
believe
her
sypher
was
not
convinced
by
the
airy
paradoxician
he
had
a
childish
idea
that
painters
and
novelists
and
actors
were
superior
beings
rattenden
found
this
arcadian
and
cultivated
sypher
society
they
took
long
walks
together
on
sunday
afternoons
after
all
said
rattenden
i
can
speak
freely
i
am
a
pariah
among
my
kind
sypher
asked
why
because
i
do
play
golf
in
london
it
is
impossible
to
be
seriously
regarded
as
a
literary
man
unless
you
play
golf
he
found
sypher
a
good
listener
he
loved
to
catch
a
theory
of
life
hold
it
in
his
hand
like
a
struggling
bird
while
he
discoursed
about
it
and
let
it
go
free
into
the
sunshine
again
sypher
admired
his
nimbleness
of
mind
you
juggle
with
ideas
as
the
fellows
on
the
stage
do
with
gilt
balls
it
a
game
i
learned
said
rattenden
it
very
useful
it
takes
mind
off
the
dull
question
of
earning
bread
and
butter
for
a
wife
and
five
children
i
wish
you
teach
it
to
me
said
sypher
i
many
wives
and
many
children
dependent
on
me
for
bread
and
butter
rattenden
was
quick
to
note
the
tone
of
depression
he
laughed
kindly
looking
on
is
just
as
good
when
you
worried
in
london
why
do
you
look
me
up
my
wife
and
i
will
play
the
game
for
you
she
an
amusing
body
heaven
knows
how
i
should
have
got
through
without
her
she
also
swears
by
sypher
cure
so
they
became
friends
sypher
since
the
blistered
heel
episode
had
lost
his
fearless
way
of
trumpeting
the
cure
far
and
wide
having
a
nervous
dread
of
seeing
the
and
of
the
hateful
words
form
themselves
on
the
lips
of
a
companion
he
became
subdued
and
spoke
only
of
travel
and
men
and
things
of
anything
but
the
cure
he
preferred
to
listen
and
as
rattenden
preferred
to
talk
he
found
conversation
a
simple
matter
rattenden
was
an
amusing
anecdotist
and
had
amassed
a
prodigious
amount
of
raw
material
for
his
craft
to
the
collector
by
some
unknown
law
of
attraction
come
the
objects
which
he
collects
everywhere
he
goes
he
finds
them
to
his
hand
as
septimus
friend
found
the
toby
jugs
wherever
rattenden
turned
a
bit
of
gossip
met
his
ear
very
few
things
therefore
happened
in
literary
and
theatrical
london
which
did
not
come
inevitably
to
his
knowledge
he
could
have
wrecked
many
homes
and
pricked
many
reputations
as
a
man
of
the
world
however
he
used
his
knowledge
with
discretion
and
as
an
artist
in
anecdote
he
selected
fastidiously
he
seldom
retailed
a
bit
of
gossip
for
its
own
sake
when
he
did
so
he
had
a
purpose
one
evening
they
dined
together
at
sypher
club
a
great
institution
with
many
thousand
members
he
had
secured
however
a
quiet
table
in
a
corner
of
the
which
was
adorned
with
portraits
of
statesmen
sypher
unfolded
his
napkin
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
i
had
good
news
middlemist
is
on
her
way
home
you
have
the
privilege
of
her
friendship
said
rattenden
you
to
be
envied
fortunate
he
preserved
some
of
the
oxford
tradition
in
tone
and
manner
he
had
brown
hair
turning
gray
a
drooping
mustache
and
wore
secured
by
a
broad
black
cord
being
very
his
eyes
seen
through
the
thick
lenses
were
almost
expressionless
zora
middlemist
said
he
squeezing
lemon
over
his
oysters
is
a
grand
and
splendid
creature
whom
i
admire
vastly
as
i
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
telling
her
that
she
is
doing
nothing
with
her
grand
and
splendid
qualities
i
suffer
under
the
ban
of
her
displeasure
what
do
you
think
she
ought
to
do
with
them
asked
sypher
it
a
difficult
and
delicate
matter
to
discuss
a
woman
with
another
man
especially
he
waved
a
significant
hand
but
i
in
my
little
way
have
written
a
novel
or
two
studies
of
women
i
speak
therefore
as
an
expert
now
just
as
a
painter
ca
correctly
draw
the
draped
figure
unless
he
has
an
anatomical
knowledge
of
the
limbs
beneath
so
is
a
novelist
unable
to
present
the
character
of
a
woman
with
sincerity
and
verisimilitude
unless
he
has
taken
into
account
all
the
hidden
physiological
workings
of
that
woman
nature
he
must
be
familiar
with
the
workings
of
the
sex
principle
within
her
although
he
need
not
show
them
in
his
work
any
more
than
the
painter
shows
the
anatomy
analyzing
thus
the
imaginary
woman
one
forms
a
habit
of
analyzing
the
real
woman
in
whom
one
takes
an
interest
or
rather
one
does
it
unconsciously
he
paused
i
told
you
it
was
rather
delicate
you
see
what
i
trying
to
get
at
zora
middlemist
is
driven
round
the
earth
like
io
by
the
gadfly
of
her
temperament
she
seeking
the
beauty
or
meaning
or
fulfilment
or
whatever
she
chooses
to
call
it
of
life
what
she
really
looking
for
is
love
i
do
believe
it
said
sypher
rattenden
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
true
all
the
same
but
in
her
case
it
the
great
love
the
big
thing
for
the
big
man
the
gorgeous
tropical
sunshine
in
which
all
the
splendor
of
her
can
develop
no
little
man
will
move
her
she
draws
them
all
round
her
that
type
has
an
irresistible
atmosphere
but
she
passes
them
by
with
her
magnificent
head
in
the
air
she
is
looking
all
the
time
for
the
big
man
the
pathetic
comedy
of
it
is
that
she
is
as
innocent
and
as
unconscious
of
the
object
of
her
search
as
the
flower
that
opens
its
heart
to
the
bee
bearing
the
pollen
on
its
wings
i
not
infallible
as
a
general
rule
in
this
case
i
am
he
hastened
to
consume
his
soup
which
had
got
cold
during
his
harangue
you
mixed
much
with
women
and
studied
them
said
sypher
i
have
i
was
engaged
to
a
girl
once
but
it
was
a
tepid
affair
she
broke
it
off
because
it
was
much
more
vital
to
me
to
work
in
my
laboratory
than
to
hold
her
hand
in
her
mother
parlor
no
doubt
she
was
right
this
was
in
the
early
days
when
i
was
experimenting
with
the
cure
since
then
i
been
a
man
of
one
idea
it
has
absorbed
all
my
soul
and
energies
so
that
i
had
none
to
spare
for
women
here
and
there
of
course
i
know
the
trifling
things
they
are
part
of
the
banquet
of
life
one
eats
and
forgets
sypher
glanced
at
him
and
nodded
his
appreciation
of
the
literary
neat
way
of
putting
things
but
he
did
not
reply
he
ate
his
fish
in
silence
hardly
tasting
it
his
mind
far
away
following
zora
middlemist
across
the
seas
a
horrible
jealous
hatred
of
the
big
man
for
whom
she
sought
sprang
up
in
his
heart
his
pink
face
flushed
red
this
bonne
is
excellent
said
rattenden
sypher
started
in
confusion
and
praised
the
chef
and
talked
gastronomy
while
his
thoughts
were
with
zora
he
remembered
the
confession
of
septimus
dix
in
paris
septimus
had
been
caught
in
the
irresistible
atmosphere
he
loved
her
but
he
was
one
of
the
little
men
and
she
had
passed
him
by
with
her
magnificent
head
in
the
air
the
gastronomic
talk
languished
presently
rattenden
said
one
of
the
feminine
phenomena
that
has
puzzled
me
most
of
late
has
been
the
marriage
of
her
sister
to
septimus
dix
sypher
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
how
extraordinary
that
you
should
mention
it
he
was
in
my
mind
as
you
spoke
i
was
thinking
of
the
sister
said
rattenden
she
has
temperament
without
her
force
of
character
the
sex
without
the
splendor
i
heard
a
very
curious
thing
about
her
only
yesterday
what
was
it
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
are
not
told
tell
me
said
sypher
earnestly
i
have
reasons
for
asking
i
am
convinced
there
are
circumstances
of
which
neither
dix
mother
nor
sister
know
anything
i
a
loyal
man
you
may
trust
me
very
well
said
rattenden
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
man
called
mordaunt
prince
yes
a
actor
about
the
biggest
blackguard
that
disgraces
the
stage
he
was
leading
man
at
the
theater
where
she
last
played
they
were
doing
widow
of
ware
they
were
about
a
great
deal
together
it
was
common
gossip
at
the
time
gossip
is
notoriously
uncharitable
said
sypher
if
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
uncharitableness
has
the
advantage
of
uncovering
them
the
however
is
responsible
for
uncovering
the
one
i
am
going
to
tell
you
of
about
two
or
three
months
before
the
marriage
emmy
oldrieve
and
mordaunt
prince
were
staying
together
at
an
hotel
in
tunbridge
wells
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
there
they
were
they
had
a
motor
with
them
a
week
before
the
dix
marriage
was
announced
mordaunt
prince
married
a
morris
old
sol
morris
the
widow
sypher
stared
at
him
it
one
of
the
least
amazing
of
human
phenomena
said
rattenden
cynically
i
only
puzzled
at
calypso
being
so
soon
able
to
console
herself
for
the
departure
of
ulysses
and
taking
up
with
such
a
shadow
of
a
man
as
our
friend
dix
the
end
of
the
mordaunt
prince
story
is
that
he
soon
grew
too
much
for
the
widow
who
has
pensioned
him
off
and
now
he
is
drinking
himself
to
death
in
naples
emmy
oldrieve
good
god
is
it
possible
cried
sypher
absently
pushing
aside
the
dish
the
waiter
handed
him
rattenden
carefully
helped
himself
to
partridge
and
orange
salad
it
not
only
possible
but
unquestionable
fact
you
see
he
added
complacently
nothing
can
happen
without
its
coming
sooner
or
later
to
me
my
informant
was
staying
at
the
hotel
all
the
time
you
will
allow
me
to
vouch
absolutely
for
her
veracity
sypher
did
not
speak
for
some
moments
the
large
with
its
portraits
of
statesmen
faded
away
and
became
a
little
street
in
paris
one
side
in
shade
and
the
other
baking
in
the
sun
and
at
a
little
iron
table
sat
a
brown
and
indiscreet
zouave
and
septimus
dix
pale
indecisive
with
a
wistful
appeal
in
his
blue
eyes
suddenly
he
regained
consciousness
and
more
for
the
sake
of
covering
his
loss
of
than
for
that
of
eating
he
recalled
the
waiter
and
put
some
partridge
on
his
plate
then
he
looked
across
the
table
at
his
guest
and
said
very
sternly
i
look
to
you
to
prevent
this
story
going
any
further
i
already
made
it
my
duty
to
do
so
said
rattenden
sypher
helped
his
guest
to
wine
i
hope
you
like
this
roederer
said
he
it
the
only
exquisite
wine
in
the
club
and
unfortunately
there
are
not
more
than
a
few
bottles
left
i
had
seven
dozen
of
the
same
in
my
cellar
at
priory
park
if
anything
in
better
condition
i
had
to
sell
it
with
the
rest
of
the
things
when
i
gave
up
the
house
it
went
to
my
heart
champagne
is
the
only
wine
i
understand
there
was
a
time
when
it
stood
as
a
symbol
to
me
of
the
unattainable
now
that
i
can
drink
it
when
i
will
i
know
that
all
the
laws
of
philosophy
forbid
its
having
any
attraction
for
me
thank
heaven
i
not
dyspeptic
enough
in
soul
to
be
a
philosopher
and
i
grateful
for
my
aspirations
i
cultivated
my
taste
for
champagne
out
of
sheer
gratitude
any
wise
man
said
rattenden
can
realize
his
dreams
it
takes
something
much
higher
than
wisdom
to
enjoy
the
realization
what
is
that
the
heart
of
a
child
said
rattenden
he
smiled
in
his
inscrutable
way
behind
his
thick
lenses
and
sipped
his
champagne
truly
a
delicious
wine
said
he
sypher
said
to
his
guest
on
the
steps
of
the
club
and
walked
home
to
his
new
chambers
in
james
deep
in
thought
for
the
first
time
since
his
acquaintance
with
rattenden
he
was
glad
to
part
from
him
he
had
a
great
need
of
solitude
it
came
to
him
almost
as
a
shock
to
realize
that
things
were
happening
in
the
world
round
about
him
quite
as
heroic
in
the
eyes
of
the
high
gods
as
the
battle
between
sypher
cure
and
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
the
curtain
of
life
had
been
lifted
and
a
flash
of
its
inner
mysteries
had
been
revealed
his
eyes
still
were
dazed
but
he
had
received
the
gift
of
vision
he
had
seen
beyond
doubt
or
question
the
heart
of
septimus
dix
he
knew
what
he
had
done
why
he
had
done
it
zora
middlemist
had
passed
septimus
by
with
her
magnificent
head
in
the
air
but
he
was
not
one
of
the
little
men
by
god
he
is
not
he
cried
aloud
and
the
cry
came
from
his
depths
zora
middlemist
had
passed
him
clem
sypher
by
with
her
magnificent
head
in
the
air
he
let
himself
into
his
chambers
they
struck
him
as
being
chill
and
lonely
the
casual
of
one
of
the
little
men
he
stirred
the
fire
almost
afraid
to
disturb
the
cold
silence
by
the
rattle
of
the
poker
against
the
bars
of
the
grate
his
slippers
were
set
in
readiness
on
the
and
the
machine
who
valeted
him
had
fitted
them
with
he
put
them
on
and
unlocking
his
desk
took
out
the
letter
which
he
had
received
that
morning
from
zora
for
you
she
wrote
i
want
victory
all
along
the
line
the
apotheosis
of
sypher
cure
on
earth
for
myself
i
do
know
what
i
want
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
clem
sypher
sat
in
an
and
looked
into
the
fire
until
it
went
out
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
chapter
xvii
the
days
that
followed
were
darkened
by
overwhelming
anxieties
so
that
he
speculated
little
as
to
the
ultimately
desired
a
chartered
accountant
sat
in
the
office
at
moorgate
street
and
shed
around
him
the
gloom
of
statistics
unless
a
miracle
happened
the
cure
was
doomed
it
is
all
very
well
to
seat
a
little
nigger
on
the
if
the
end
of
the
journey
is
in
sight
the
boiler
may
just
last
out
the
strain
but
to
suppose
that
he
will
sit
there
in
permanent
security
to
himself
and
the
ship
for
an
indefinite
time
is
an
optimism
unwarranted
by
the
general
experience
of
this
low
world
sypher
cure
could
not
stand
the
strain
of
the
increased
advertisement
shuttleworth
found
a
dismal
pleasure
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
a
reduction
in
price
had
not
materially
affected
the
sales
the
jebusa
jones
people
had
lowered
the
price
of
the
cuticle
remedy
and
still
undersold
the
cure
during
the
year
the
bermondsey
works
had
been
heavily
mortgaged
the
money
had
all
been
wasted
on
a
public
that
had
eyes
and
saw
not
that
had
ears
and
heard
not
the
simple
gospel
of
the
friend
of
humanity
try
sypher
cure
in
the
midst
of
the
gloom
shuttleworth
took
the
opportunity
of
deprecating
the
unnecessary
expense
of
production
never
having
so
greatly
dared
before
only
the
best
and
purest
materials
had
been
possible
for
the
divine
ointment
by
using
second
qualities
a
great
saving
could
be
effected
without
impairing
the
efficacy
of
the
cure
thus
shuttleworth
sypher
blazed
into
holy
anger
as
if
he
had
been
counseled
to
commit
sacrilege
radical
reforms
were
imperative
if
the
cure
was
to
be
saved
he
spent
his
nights
over
vast
schemes
only
to
find
the
fatal
flaw
in
the
cold
light
of
the
morning
this
angered
him
it
seemed
that
the
sureness
of
his
vision
had
gone
something
strange
uncanny
had
happened
within
him
he
knew
not
what
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
intellectual
force
his
personal
energy
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
determination
to
win
through
and
restore
the
cure
to
its
former
position
in
the
market
it
was
something
subtle
spiritual
the
memory
of
the
blistered
heel
lived
with
him
the
slight
doubt
cast
by
septimus
on
zora
faith
remained
disturbingly
at
the
back
of
his
mind
yet
he
clung
passionately
to
his
belief
if
it
were
not
then
was
he
of
men
most
miserable
never
had
he
welcomed
the
sight
of
nunsmere
more
than
the
next
saturday
afternoon
when
the
trap
turned
off
the
highroad
and
the
common
came
into
view
the
pearls
and
faint
blues
of
the
sky
the
tender
mist
softening
the
russet
of
the
autumn
trees
the
gray
tower
of
the
little
church
the
red
roofs
of
the
cottages
dreaming
in
their
gardens
the
quiet
green
of
the
common
with
the
children
far
off
at
play
and
the
lame
donkey
watching
them
in
philosophic
content
all
came
like
the
gift
of
a
very
calm
and
restful
god
to
the
tired
man
eyes
he
thought
to
himself
it
only
lacks
one
figure
walking
across
the
common
to
meet
me
then
the
thought
again
if
she
were
there
would
i
see
anything
else
at
penton
court
the
maid
met
him
at
the
door
dix
is
waiting
to
see
you
sir
dix
where
is
he
in
the
he
has
been
waiting
a
couple
of
hours
he
threw
off
his
hat
and
coat
delighted
and
rushed
in
to
welcome
the
unexpected
guest
he
found
septimus
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
the
french
window
that
opened
on
the
lawn
and
making
elaborate
calculations
in
a
my
dear
dix
he
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
this
is
more
than
a
pleasure
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
septimus
said
holding
up
the
i
was
just
trying
to
work
out
the
problem
whether
a
boy
expenses
from
the
time
he
begins
to
the
time
he
leaves
the
university
increases
by
arithmetical
or
geometrical
progression
sypher
laughed
it
depends
does
it
on
his
taste
for
luxuries
this
one
is
going
to
be
extravagant
i
afraid
said
septimus
he
cuts
his
teeth
on
a
italian
ivory
carving
of
john
the
baptist
i
went
into
a
shop
to
buy
a
purse
and
they
gave
it
to
me
instead
and
turns
up
his
nose
at
coral
and
bells
there
is
much
of
it
to
turn
up
i
never
seen
a
child
with
so
little
nose
i
invented
a
machine
for
elongating
it
but
his
mother
wo
let
me
use
it
sypher
expressed
his
sympathy
with
dix
and
inquired
after
her
health
septimus
reported
favorably
she
had
passed
a
few
weeks
at
which
had
done
her
good
she
was
now
in
paris
under
the
mothering
care
of
madame
bolivard
where
she
would
stay
until
she
cared
to
take
up
her
residence
in
her
flat
in
chelsea
which
was
now
free
from
tenants
and
you
asked
sypher
i
just
left
the
hôtel
godet
and
come
back
to
nunsmere
perhaps
give
up
the
house
and
take
wiggleswick
to
london
when
emmy
returns
she
promised
to
look
for
a
flat
for
me
i
believe
women
are
rather
good
at
finding
flats
sypher
handed
him
a
box
of
cigars
he
lit
one
and
held
it
awkwardly
with
the
tips
of
his
long
nervous
fingers
he
passed
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
with
the
familiar
gesture
up
his
hair
i
thought
i
come
and
see
you
he
said
hesitatingly
before
going
to
nook
there
are
explanations
to
be
made
my
wife
and
i
are
good
friends
but
we
ca
live
together
it
all
my
fault
i
make
the
house
intolerable
i
i
have
an
ungovernable
temper
you
know
and
i
harsh
and
unloving
and
disagreeable
and
it
bad
for
the
child
we
quarrel
dreadfully
at
least
she
does
what
about
sypher
asked
gravely
all
sorts
of
things
you
see
if
i
want
breakfast
an
hour
before
it
upsets
the
household
then
there
was
the
nose
machine
and
other
inventions
for
the
baby
which
perhaps
might
kill
it
you
can
explain
all
this
and
tell
them
that
the
marriage
has
been
a
dreadful
mistake
on
poor
emmy
side
and
that
we
decided
to
live
apart
you
will
do
this
for
me
wo
you
i
ca
say
i
do
it
with
pleasure
said
sypher
for
i
more
than
sorry
to
hear
your
news
i
suspected
as
much
when
i
met
you
in
paris
but
i
see
oldrieve
as
soon
as
possible
and
explain
thank
you
said
septimus
you
do
know
what
a
service
you
would
be
rendering
me
he
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
and
relit
his
cigar
which
had
gone
out
during
his
appeal
then
there
was
a
silence
septimus
looked
dreamily
out
at
the
row
of
trees
that
marked
the
famous
lawn
reaching
down
to
the
railway
line
the
mist
had
thickened
with
the
fall
of
the
day
and
hung
heavy
on
the
branches
and
the
sky
was
gray
sypher
watched
him
greatly
moved
tempted
to
cry
out
that
he
knew
all
that
he
was
not
taken
in
by
the
simple
legend
of
his
ungovernable
temper
and
unlovely
disposition
his
heart
went
out
to
him
as
to
a
man
who
dwelt
alone
on
lofty
heights
inaccessible
to
common
humanity
he
was
filled
with
pity
and
reverence
for
him
perhaps
he
exaggerated
but
sypher
was
an
idealist
had
he
not
set
sypher
cure
as
the
sun
in
his
heaven
and
zora
as
one
of
the
fixed
stars
it
grew
dark
sypher
rang
for
the
lamp
and
tea
or
would
you
like
breakfast
he
asked
laughingly
i
just
had
supper
said
septimus
wiggleswick
found
some
cheese
in
a
cupboard
i
buried
it
in
the
front
garden
a
vague
smile
passed
on
his
face
like
a
pale
gleam
of
light
over
water
on
a
cloudy
day
wiggleswick
is
deaf
he
could
hear
it
he
a
lazy
scoundrel
said
sypher
i
wonder
you
do
sack
him
septimus
licked
a
hanging
strip
of
into
position
he
could
never
smoke
a
cigar
properly
and
lit
it
for
the
third
time
wiggleswick
is
good
for
me
said
he
he
keeps
me
human
i
am
apt
to
become
a
machine
i
live
so
much
among
them
i
been
working
hard
on
a
new
gun
or
rather
an
old
gun
it
field
artillery
i
got
on
to
the
idea
again
from
a
sighting
apparatus
i
invented
i
have
the
specification
in
my
pocket
the
model
is
at
home
i
brought
it
from
paris
he
fetched
a
parcel
of
manuscript
from
his
pocket
and
unrolled
it
into
flatness
i
should
like
to
show
it
to
you
do
you
mind
it
would
interest
me
enormously
said
sypher
i
invent
all
sorts
of
things
i
ca
help
it
but
i
always
come
back
to
guns
i
do
know
why
i
hope
you
done
nothing
further
with
the
guns
of
large
caliber
i
been
thinking
about
them
seriously
and
i
find
all
moonshine
he
smiled
with
wan
cheerfulness
at
the
waste
of
the
labor
of
years
sypher
on
whose
conscience
the
guns
had
laid
their
two
hundred
ton
weight
felt
greatly
relieved
their
colossal
scale
had
originally
caught
his
imagination
which
loved
big
conceptions
their
working
had
seemed
plausible
to
his
inexpert
eye
he
had
gone
with
confidence
to
his
friend
the
expert
on
naval
gunnery
who
had
reported
on
them
in
breezy
terms
of
disrespect
since
then
he
had
shrunk
from
destroying
his
poor
illusions
yes
they
all
unmanageable
i
see
what
wrong
with
them
but
i
lost
my
interest
in
naval
affairs
he
paused
and
added
dreamily
i
was
horribly
seasick
crossing
the
channel
this
time
let
us
have
a
look
at
the
said
sypher
encouragingly
remembering
the
naval
man
language
he
had
little
hope
that
septimus
would
be
more
successful
by
land
than
by
sea
but
his
love
and
pity
for
the
inventor
compelled
interest
septimus
face
brightened
this
said
he
is
quite
a
different
thing
you
see
i
know
more
about
it
that
where
the
bombardier
comes
in
laughed
sypher
i
should
wonder
replied
septimus
he
spread
the
diagram
on
a
table
and
expounded
the
gun
absorbed
in
his
explanation
he
lost
the
drowsy
incertitude
of
his
speech
and
the
dreaminess
of
his
eyes
he
spoke
with
rapidity
sureness
and
a
note
of
enthusiasm
rang
oddly
in
his
voice
on
the
margins
he
sketched
illustrations
of
the
gatling
the
maxim
and
the
hotchkiss
and
other
guns
and
demonstrated
the
superior
delicate
deadliness
of
his
own
it
could
fire
more
rounds
per
minute
than
any
other
piece
of
artillery
known
to
man
it
could
feed
itself
automatically
from
a
magazine
the
new
sighting
apparatus
made
it
as
accurate
as
a
match
rifle
its
power
of
massacre
was
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
wholesale
slaughter
a
child
might
work
it
septimus
explanation
was
too
lucid
for
a
man
of
sypher
intelligence
not
to
grasp
the
essentials
of
his
invention
to
all
his
questions
septimus
returned
satisfactory
answers
he
could
find
no
flaw
in
the
gun
yet
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
the
expert
would
put
his
finger
on
the
weak
spot
and
consign
the
machine
to
the
limbo
of
phantasmagoric
artillery
if
it
is
all
you
say
there
a
fortune
in
it
said
he
there
no
shadow
of
doubt
about
it
replied
septimus
i
send
wiggleswick
over
with
the
model
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
said
septimus
in
his
usual
manner
i
never
know
what
to
do
with
things
when
i
invent
them
i
once
knew
a
man
in
the
patent
office
who
patented
things
for
me
but
he
married
now
and
gone
to
live
in
balham
but
he
still
at
the
patent
office
perhaps
he
is
said
septimus
it
never
occurred
to
me
but
it
has
never
done
me
any
good
to
have
things
patented
one
has
to
get
them
taken
up
some
of
them
are
drunk
and
disorderly
enough
for
them
to
be
taken
up
at
once
he
added
with
his
pale
smile
he
continued
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
replace
the
guns
in
our
contract
by
this
one
sypher
agreed
with
pleasure
to
the
proposal
he
knew
a
high
military
official
in
the
ordnance
department
of
the
war
office
who
would
see
that
the
thing
was
properly
considered
if
he
in
town
i
go
and
see
him
at
once
there
no
hurry
said
septimus
i
should
like
you
to
put
yourself
out
i
know
you
a
very
busy
man
go
in
any
time
you
happen
to
be
passing
you
are
there
pretty
often
now
i
suppose
why
my
friend
hégisippe
cruchot
gave
you
an
idea
in
paris
about
feet
how
is
it
developing
sypher
made
a
wry
face
i
found
my
dear
dix
it
was
like
your
guns
of
large
caliber
he
rose
and
walked
impatiently
about
the
room
do
let
us
talk
about
the
cure
there
a
dear
fellow
i
come
down
here
to
forget
it
forget
it
septimus
stared
at
him
in
amazement
yes
to
clear
my
mind
and
brain
of
it
to
get
a
couple
of
nights
sleep
after
the
rest
of
the
week
nightmare
the
concern
is
going
to
hell
as
fast
as
it
can
and
he
stopped
in
front
of
septimus
and
brought
down
his
hands
in
a
passionate
gesture
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
believe
it
what
i
going
through
god
only
knows
i
at
least
had
no
notion
said
septimus
and
i
been
worrying
you
with
my
silly
twaddle
about
babies
and
guns
it
a
godsend
for
me
to
hear
of
anything
save
ruin
and
the
breaking
up
of
all
that
was
dear
to
me
in
life
it
not
like
failure
in
an
ordinary
business
it
has
been
infinitely
more
than
a
business
to
me
it
has
been
a
religion
it
is
still
that
why
my
soul
refuses
to
grasp
facts
and
figures
he
went
on
feeling
a
relief
in
pouring
out
his
heart
to
one
who
could
understand
to
no
one
had
he
thus
spoken
with
an
expansive
nature
he
had
the
strong
man
pride
to
the
world
in
general
he
turned
the
conquering
face
of
clem
sypher
the
friend
of
humanity
of
sypher
cure
to
septimus
alone
had
he
shown
the
man
in
his
desperate
revolt
against
defeat
the
lines
around
his
mouth
deepened
into
lines
of
pain
and
pain
lay
behind
his
clear
eyes
and
in
the
knitting
of
his
brows
i
believed
the
almighty
had
put
an
instrument
for
the
relief
of
human
suffering
into
my
hands
i
dreamed
great
dreams
i
saw
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
blessing
me
i
know
i
was
a
damned
fool
so
are
you
so
is
every
visionary
so
are
the
apostles
the
missionaries
the
explorers
all
who
dream
great
dreams
all
damned
fools
but
a
glorious
company
all
the
same
i
not
ashamed
to
belong
to
it
but
there
comes
a
time
when
the
apostle
finds
himself
preaching
to
the
empty
winds
and
the
explorer
discovers
his
el
dorado
to
be
a
barren
island
and
he
either
goes
mad
or
breaks
his
heart
and
which
of
the
two
i
going
to
do
i
do
know
perhaps
both
zora
middlemist
will
be
back
soon
said
septimus
she
is
coming
by
the
white
star
line
and
she
ought
to
be
in
marseilles
by
the
end
of
next
week
she
writes
me
that
she
may
winter
in
egypt
that
is
why
she
chose
the
white
star
line
said
sypher
have
you
told
her
what
you
told
me
no
said
sypher
and
i
never
shall
while
there
a
hope
left
she
knows
it
a
fight
but
i
tell
her
as
i
have
told
my
damned
fool
of
a
soul
that
i
shall
conquer
would
you
like
to
go
to
her
and
say
done
beaten
besides
i
not
he
turned
and
poked
the
fire
smashing
a
great
lump
of
coal
with
a
stroke
of
his
muscular
arm
as
if
it
had
been
the
skull
of
the
jebusa
jones
dragon
septimus
twirled
his
small
mustache
and
his
hand
inevitably
went
to
his
hair
he
had
the
scared
look
he
always
wore
at
moments
when
he
was
coming
to
a
decision
but
you
would
like
to
see
zora
would
you
he
asked
sypher
wheeled
round
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
that
of
a
prisoner
in
the
bastille
who
had
been
asked
whether
he
would
like
a
summer
banquet
beneath
the
trees
of
fontainebleau
you
know
that
very
well
said
he
he
laid
down
the
poker
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
chair
i
often
thought
of
what
you
said
in
paris
about
her
going
away
you
were
quite
right
you
have
a
genius
for
saying
and
doing
the
simple
right
thing
we
almost
began
our
friendship
by
your
saying
it
do
you
remember
it
was
in
monte
carlo
you
remember
that
you
did
like
my
looking
on
middlemist
as
an
advertisement
oh
you
need
look
uncomfortable
my
dear
fellow
i
loved
you
for
it
in
paris
you
practically
told
me
that
i
ought
to
regard
her
as
a
kind
of
fetich
for
the
cure
and
claim
her
bodily
presence
you
also
put
before
me
the
fact
that
there
was
no
more
reason
for
her
to
believe
in
the
cure
than
yourself
or
hégisippe
cruchot
if
you
could
tell
me
anything
more
said
he
earnestly
i
should
value
it
what
he
expected
to
learn
from
septimus
he
did
not
know
but
once
having
exalted
him
to
inaccessible
heights
the
indomitable
idealist
was
convinced
that
from
his
lips
would
fall
words
of
gentle
olympian
wisdom
septimus
blushing
at
his
temerity
in
having
pointed
out
the
way
to
the
man
whom
he
regarded
as
the
incarnation
of
force
and
energy
curled
himself
up
awkwardly
in
his
chair
clasping
his
ankles
between
his
locked
fingers
at
last
the
oracle
spoke
if
i
were
you
he
said
before
going
mad
or
breaking
my
heart
i
should
wait
until
i
saw
zora
very
well
it
will
be
a
long
time
perhaps
so
much
the
better
i
shall
remain
sane
and
all
the
longer
after
dinner
sypher
went
round
to
the
nook
and
executed
his
difficult
mission
as
best
he
could
to
carry
out
septimus
wishes
which
involved
the
vilification
of
the
innocent
and
the
beatification
of
the
guilty
went
against
his
conscience
he
omitted
therefore
reference
to
the
demoniac
rages
which
turned
the
home
into
an
inferno
and
to
the
quarrels
over
the
machine
for
elongating
the
baby
nose
their
tempers
were
incompatible
they
found
a
common
life
impossible
so
according
to
the
wise
modern
view
of
things
they
had
decided
to
live
apart
while
maintaining
cordial
relations
oldrieve
was
greatly
distressed
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
on
to
her
knitting
the
old
order
was
changing
too
rapidly
for
her
and
the
new
to
which
it
was
giving
place
seemed
anarchy
to
her
bewildered
eyes
she
held
up
tremulous
hands
in
protest
husband
and
wife
living
apart
so
cheerfully
for
such
trivial
reasons
even
if
one
had
suffered
great
wrong
at
the
hands
of
the
other
it
was
their
duty
to
remain
side
by
side
those
whom
god
had
joined
together
he
did
snapped
cousin
jane
they
were
joined
together
by
a
scrubby
man
in
a
registry
office
this
is
the
wild
and
unjust
way
in
which
women
talk
for
aught
cousin
jane
knew
the
chelsea
registrar
might
have
been
an
antinous
for
beauty
oldrieve
shook
her
head
sadly
she
had
known
how
it
would
be
if
only
they
had
been
married
in
church
by
their
good
vicar
this
calamity
could
not
have
befallen
them
all
the
churches
and
all
the
vicars
and
all
the
archbishops
could
have
made
that
man
anything
else
than
a
doddering
idiot
how
emmy
could
have
borne
with
him
for
a
day
passes
my
understanding
she
has
done
well
to
get
rid
of
him
she
has
made
a
mess
of
it
of
course
people
who
marry
in
that
way
generally
do
it
serves
her
right
so
spoke
cousin
jane
whom
sypher
found
in
a
sense
an
unexpected
ally
she
made
his
task
easier
oldrieve
remained
unconvinced
and
the
baby
just
a
month
or
so
old
poor
little
thing
what
to
become
of
it
emmy
will
have
to
come
here
said
cousin
jane
firmly
and
i
bring
it
up
emmy
is
fit
to
educate
a
rabbit
you
had
better
write
and
order
her
to
come
home
at
once
i
write
sighed
oldrieve
sypher
reflected
on
the
impossibilities
of
the
proposition
and
on
the
reasons
emmy
still
had
for
remaining
in
exile
in
paris
he
also
pitied
the
child
that
was
to
be
brought
up
by
cousin
jane
it
had
extravagant
tastes
he
smiled
my
friend
dix
is
already
thinking
of
sending
him
to
the
university
so
you
see
they
have
plans
for
his
education
cousin
jane
sniffed
she
would
make
plans
for
them
as
for
the
university
if
it
could
turn
out
a
doddering
idiot
like
septimus
it
was
criminal
to
send
any
young
man
to
such
a
seat
of
unlearning
she
would
not
allow
him
to
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
emmy
was
to
be
summoned
to
nunsmere
sypher
was
about
to
deprecate
the
idea
when
he
reflected
again
and
thought
of
hotspur
and
the
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
cousin
jane
could
call
and
so
could
oldrieve
but
would
emmy
come
as
the
answer
to
the
question
was
in
the
negative
he
left
cousin
jane
to
her
comfortable
resolutions
you
will
no
doubt
discuss
the
matter
with
dix
he
said
cousin
jane
threw
up
her
hands
oh
for
goodness
sake
do
let
him
come
here
i
could
bear
the
sight
of
him
sypher
looked
inquiringly
at
oldrieve
it
has
been
a
great
shock
to
me
said
the
gentle
lady
it
will
take
time
to
get
over
it
perhaps
he
had
better
wait
a
little
sypher
walked
home
in
a
wrathful
mood
ostracism
was
to
be
added
to
septimus
crown
of
martyrdom
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
the
closing
of
the
nook
doors
was
advantageous
he
had
dreaded
the
result
of
cousin
as
lying
was
not
one
of
his
friend
conspicuous
accomplishments
soothed
by
this
reflection
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
took
down
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
from
his
shelves
while
he
was
deriving
spiritual
entertainment
from
the
great
battle
between
christian
and
apollyon
and
consolation
from
the
latter
discomfiture
septimus
was
walking
down
the
road
to
the
a
letter
in
his
hand
the
envelope
was
addressed
to
middlemist
white
star
marseilles
it
contained
a
blank
sheet
of
headed
and
the
tail
of
a
little
china
dog
chapter

as
soon
as
a
woman
knows
what
she
wants
she
generally
gets
it
some
philosophers
assert
that
her
methods
are
circuitous
others
on
the
other
hand
maintain
that
she
rides
in
a
bee
line
toward
the
desired
object
galloping
ruthlessly
over
conventions
susceptibilities
hearts
and
such
like
obstacles
all
however
agree
that
she
is
unscrupulous
that
the
wish
of
the
woman
is
the
politely
insincere
wish
of
the
deity
and
that
she
pursues
her
course
with
a
serene
sureness
unknown
to
man
it
is
when
a
woman
does
not
know
what
she
wants
that
she
baffles
the
philosopher
just
as
the
ant
in
her
aimless
discursiveness
baffles
the
entomologist
of
course
if
the
philosopher
has
guessed
her
unformulated
desire
then
things
are
easy
for
him
and
he
can
discourse
with
certitude
on
feminine
vagaries
as
rattenden
did
on
the
journeyings
of
zora
middlemist
he
has
the
word
of
the
enigma
but
to
the
woman
herself
her
state
of
mind
is
an
exasperating
puzzle
and
to
her
friends
philosophic
or
otherwise
her
consequent
actions
are
disconcerting
zora
went
to
california
where
she
was
hospitably
entertained
and
shown
the
sights
of
several
vast
neighborhoods
she
peeped
into
the
chinese
quarter
at
san
francisco
and
visited
the
yosemite
valley
attentive
young
men
strewed
her
path
with
flowers
and
candy
young
women
vowed
her
eternal
devotion
she
came
into
touch
with
the
intimate
problems
of
the
most
wonderful
social
organism
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
was
confronted
with
stupendous
works
of
nature
and
illimitable
solitudes
wherein
the
soul
stands
appalled
she
also
ate
a
great
quantity
of
peaches
when
her
visit
to
the
callenders
had
come
to
an
end
she
armed
herself
with
introductions
and
started
off
by
herself
to
see
america
she
traveled
across
the
continent
beheld
the
majesty
of
niagara
and
the
bewildering
life
of
new
york
she
went
to
washington
and
boston
in
fact
she
learned
many
things
about
a
great
country
which
were
very
good
for
her
to
know
receiving
impressions
with
the
alertness
of
a
sympathetic
intellect
and
pigeonholing
them
with
feminine
conscientiousness
for
future
reference
it
was
all
very
pleasant
healthful
and
instructive
but
it
no
more
helped
her
in
her
quest
than
gazing
at
the
jewelers
windows
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
sierras
and
crowded
were
equally
unsuggestive
of
a
mission
in
life
in
the
rare
moments
which
activity
allowed
her
for
depression
she
began
to
wonder
whether
she
was
not
chasing
the
phantom
of
a
wild
goose
a
damsel
to
whom
in
a
moment
of
expansion
she
revealed
the
object
of
her
journeying
exclaimed
what
other
mission
in
life
has
a
woman
than
to
spend
money
and
look
beautiful
zora
laughed
incredulously
you
accomplished
half
already
for
you
do
look
beautiful
said
the
damsel
the
other
half
is
easy
but
if
you
have
much
money
to
spend
spend
somebody
else
lord
if
i
had
your
beauty
i
just
walk
down
wall
street
and
pick
up
a
millionaire
between
my
finger
and
thumb
and
carry
him
off
right
away
when
zora
suggested
that
life
perhaps
might
have
some
deeper
significance
the
maiden
answered
life
is
like
the
school
child
idea
of
a
parable
a
heavenly
story
if
you
lots
of
money
with
no
earthly
meaning
do
you
ever
go
down
beneath
the
surface
of
things
asked
zora
if
you
dig
down
far
enough
into
the
earth
replied
the
damsel
you
come
to
water
if
you
bore
down
deep
enough
into
life
you
come
to
tears
my
dear
i
going
to
dance
on
the
surface
and
have
a
good
time
as
long
as
i
can
and
i
guess
you
doing
the
same
i
suppose
i
am
said
zora
and
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
at
washington
fate
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
attaining
the
other
half
of
the
damsel
idea
an
elderly
senator
of
enormous
wealth
proposed
marriage
and
offered
her
half
a
dozen
a
few
palaces
and
most
of
the
two
hemispheres
she
declined
if
i
were
young
would
you
marry
me
zora
beautiful
shoulders
gave
the
tiniest
shrug
of
uncertainty
perhaps
her
young
friend
was
right
and
the
command
of
the
earth
was
worth
the
slight
penalty
of
a
husband
she
was
tired
and
disheartened
at
finding
herself
no
nearer
to
the
heart
of
things
than
when
she
had
left
nunsmere
her
attitude
toward
the
once
unspeakable
sex
had
imperceptibly
changed
she
no
longer
blazed
with
indignation
when
a
man
made
love
to
her
she
even
found
it
more
agreeable
than
looking
at
cataracts
or
lunching
with
ambassadors
sometimes
she
wondered
why
the
senator
she
treated
very
tenderly
i
do
know
how
can
i
tell
she
said
a
moment
or
two
after
the
shrug
my
heart
is
young
said
he
zora
met
his
eyes
for
the
millionth
part
of
a
second
and
turned
her
head
away
deeply
sorry
for
him
the
woman
instinctive
look
dealt
instantaneous
death
to
his
hopes
it
was
one
more
enactment
of
the
tragedy
of
the
bald
head
and
the
gray
beard
he
spoke
with
pathetic
bitterness
like
don
ruy
gomez
da
silva
in
hernani
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
now
when
a
young
fellow
passed
him
in
the
street
he
would
give
up
all
his
and
all
his
colossal
business
for
the
young
fellow
raven
hair
and
bright
eyes
then
you
would
love
me
i
could
make
you
what
is
love
after
all
asked
zora
the
elderly
senator
looked
wistfully
through
the
years
over
an
infinite
welter
of
seeing
nothing
else
it
the
meaning
of
life
said
he
i
discovered
it
too
late
he
went
away
sorrowful
and
zora
saw
the
vanity
of
great
possessions
on
the
homeward
steamer
she
had
as
a
traveling
companion
a
young
englishman
whom
she
had
met
at
los
angeles
one
anthony
dasent
an
engineer
of
some
distinction
he
was
bronzed
and
healthy
and
she
liked
him
because
he
had
brains
and
looked
her
squarely
in
the
face
on
the
first
evening
of
the
voyage
a
slight
lurch
of
the
vessel
caused
her
to
slip
and
she
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
caught
her
by
the
arms
for
the
first
time
she
realized
how
strong
a
man
could
be
it
was
a
new
sensation
not
unpleasurable
and
in
thanking
him
she
blushed
he
remained
with
her
on
deck
and
talked
of
their
california
friends
and
the
united
states
the
next
day
he
established
himself
by
her
side
and
discoursed
on
the
sea
and
the
sky
human
aspirations
the
discomforts
of
his
cabin
and
a
belief
in
eternal
punishment
the
day
after
that
he
told
her
of
his
ambitions
and
showed
her
photographs
of
his
mother
and
sisters
after
that
they
exchanged
views
on
the
discipline
of
loneliness
his
profession
he
observed
took
him
to
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
where
there
was
never
a
woman
to
cheer
him
and
when
he
came
back
to
england
he
returned
to
a
hearth
equally
unconsoled
zora
began
to
pity
his
forlorn
condition
to
build
strong
bridges
and
lay
down
railroads
was
a
glorious
thing
for
a
man
to
do
to
do
it
without
sweetheart
or
wife
was
nothing
less
than
heroic
in
the
course
of
time
he
told
her
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
met
he
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
gold
flecks
in
her
brown
eyes
and
the
gleams
of
gold
in
her
hair
when
it
was
caught
by
the
sun
he
also
wished
that
his
sisters
could
have
their
skirts
cut
like
hers
and
could
learn
the
art
of
tying
a
veil
over
a
hat
then
he
took
to
scowling
on
inoffensive
young
men
who
fetched
her
wraps
and
lent
her
their
binoculars
he
declared
one
of
them
to
be
an
unmitigated
ass
to
throw
whom
overboard
would
be
to
insult
the
atlantic
and
then
zora
recognized
that
he
was
stolidly
in
love
with
her
after
the
manner
of
his
stolid
kind
she
felt
frightened
and
accused
herself
of
coquetry
her
sympathy
with
his
barren
existence
had
perhaps
overstepped
the
boundaries
of
polite
interest
she
had
raised
false
hopes
in
a
young
and
ingenuous
bosom
she
worked
herself
up
to
a
virtuous
pitch
of
and
flagellated
herself
soundly
taking
the
precaution
however
of
wadding
the
knots
of
the
scourge
with
after
all
was
it
her
fault
that
a
wholesome
young
briton
should
fall
in
love
with
her
she
remembered
rattenden
uncomfortable
words
on
the
eve
of
her
first
pilgrimage
beautiful
women
like
yourself
radiating
feminine
magnetism
worry
a
man
exceedingly
you
do
let
him
go
about
in
peace
so
why
should
he
let
you
so
zora
came
face
to
face
with
the
eternal
battle
of
the
sexes
she
stamped
her
foot
in
the
privacy
of
her
cabin
and
declared
the
principle
to
be
horrid
and
primeval
and
everything
that
was
most
revolting
to
a
woman
who
had
earnestly
set
forth
to
discover
the
highest
things
of
life
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
she
avoided
anthony
dasent
company
as
much
as
possible
and
lest
he
should
add
jealousy
to
the
gloom
in
which
he
enveloped
himself
sought
unexciting
joys
in
the
society
of
a
geologist
who
discoursed
playfully
on
the
foraminifera
of
the
pacific
slope
one
day
dasent
came
on
her
alone
and
burst
out
wrathfully
why
are
you
treating
me
like
this
like
what
you
are
making
a
fool
of
me
i
not
going
to
stand
it
then
she
realized
that
when
the
average
man
does
not
get
what
he
wants
exactly
when
he
wants
it
he
loses
his
temper
she
soothed
him
according
to
the
better
instincts
of
her
sex
but
resolved
to
play
no
more
with
elementary
young
britons
geologists
were
safer
companions
the
former
pitched
their
hearts
into
her
lap
the
latter
like
pawkins
the
geologist
of
the
pacific
slope
gave
her
boxes
of
fossils
she
preferred
the
fossils
you
could
do
what
you
liked
with
them
throw
them
overboard
when
the
donor
was
not
looking
or
leave
them
behind
in
a
railway
carriage
or
take
them
home
and
present
them
to
the
vicar
who
collected
butterflies
beetles
ammonites
and
tobacco
stoppers
but
an
odd
assortment
of
hearts
to
a
woman
who
does
not
want
them
is
really
a
confounded
nuisance
zora
was
very
much
relieved
when
dasent
after
eating
an
enormous
breakfast
bade
her
a
tragic
farewell
at
gibraltar
it
was
a
cloudless
afternoon
when
she
steamed
into
marseilles
the
barren
rock
islands
on
the
east
rose
from
a
blue
sea
to
the
west
lay
the
isles
of
frioul
and
the
island
of
the
château
with
its
prison
lying
grim
and
long
on
the
crest
in
front
the
busy
port
the
white
noble
city
crowned
by
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
la
garde
standing
sentinel
against
the
clear
sky
zora
stood
on
the
crowded
deck
watching
the
scene
touched
as
she
always
was
by
natural
beauty
but
sad
at
heart
marseilles
within
hours
of
london
meant
home
although
she
intended
to
continue
her
wanderings
to
naples
and
alexandria
she
felt
that
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
journey
it
had
been
as
profitless
as
the
last
pawkins
by
her
side
pointed
out
the
geological
feature
of
the
rocks
she
listened
vaguely
and
wondered
whether
she
was
to
bring
him
home
tied
to
her
chariot
as
she
had
brought
septimus
dix
and
clem
sypher
the
thought
of
sypher
drew
her
heart
to
marseilles
i
wish
i
were
landing
here
like
you
and
going
straight
home
she
said
interrupting
the
flow
of
scientific
information
i
already
been
to
naples
and
i
shall
find
nothing
i
want
at
alexandria
geologically
it
not
very
interesting
said
pawkins
i
afraid
prehistoric
antiquity
does
make
my
pulses
beat
faster
that
the
advantage
of
it
one
might
just
as
well
be
a
fossil
oneself
much
better
said
pawkins
who
had
read
schopenhauer
you
are
not
exhilarating
to
a
depressed
woman
said
zora
with
a
laugh
i
am
sorry
he
replied
stiffly
i
was
trying
to
entertain
you
he
regarded
her
severely
out
of
his
one
eye
and
edged
away
as
if
he
repented
having
wasted
his
time
over
so
futile
an
organism
as
a
woman
but
her
feminine
magnetism
drew
him
back
i
rather
glad
you
are
going
on
to
alexandria
he
remarked
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
and
before
she
could
reply
he
marched
off
to
look
after
his
luggage
zora
eyes
followed
him
until
he
disappeared
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
apparently
geologists
were
as
unsafe
as
elementary
young
britons
and
opulent
senators
she
felt
unfairly
treated
by
providence
it
was
maddening
to
realize
herself
as
of
no
use
in
the
universe
except
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
opposite
sex
she
clenched
her
hands
in
impotent
anger
there
was
no
mission
on
earth
which
she
could
fulfil
she
thought
enviously
of
cousin
jane
the
steamer
entered
the
harbor
the
passengers
for
marseilles
landed
and
the
mail
was
brought
aboard
there
was
only
one
letter
for
middlemist
it
bore
the
nunsmere
postmark
she
opened
it
and
found
the
tail
of
the
little
china
dog
she
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
wonderingly
as
it
lay
absurdly
curled
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
the
thing
was
so
grotesquely
trivial
it
meant
so
much
it
was
a
sign
and
a
token
falling
as
it
were
from
the
sky
into
the
midst
of
her
despairing
mood
rebuking
her
summoning
her
declaring
an
unknown
mission
which
she
was
bound
to
execute
it
lay
in
her
hand
like
a
bit
of
destiny
inexorable
unquestionable
silently
compelling
her
forthwith
to
the
human
soul
that
stood
in
great
need
of
her
fate
had
granted
the
wish
she
had
expressed
to
the
geologist
she
landed
at
marseilles
and
sped
homeward
by
the
night
train
her
heart
torn
with
anxiety
for
septimus
all
night
long
the
rhythmic
clatter
of
the
train
shaped
itself
into
the
burden
of
her
words
to
him
if
ever
you
want
me
badly
send
me
the
tail
and
i
come
to
you
from
any
distance
she
had
spoken
then
half
jestingly
all
tenderly
that
evening
she
had
loved
him
in
a
sort
of
way
and
now
that
he
had
sent
for
her
the
love
returned
the
vivid
experiences
of
the
past
months
which
had
blinded
her
to
the
quieter
light
of
home
faded
away
into
darkness
septimus
in
urgent
need
emmy
and
clem
sypher
filled
her
thoughts
she
felt
thankful
that
sypher
strong
and
was
there
to
be
her
ally
should
her
course
with
septimus
be
difficult
between
them
they
could
surely
rescue
the
ineffectual
being
from
whatever
dangers
assailed
him
but
what
could
they
be
the
question
racked
her
did
it
concern
emmy
a
child
she
knew
had
just
been
born
a
chill
fear
crept
on
her
lest
some
tragedy
had
occurred
through
septimus
folly
from
him
any
outrageous
senselessness
might
be
expected
and
emmy
herself
was
scarcely
less
irresponsible
than
her
babe
she
reproached
herself
for
having
suggested
his
marriage
with
emmy
perhaps
in
his
vacant
way
he
had
acted
entirely
on
her
prompting
the
marriage
was
wrong
two
helpless
children
should
never
have
taken
on
themselves
the
graver
duties
of
life
toward
each
other
and
future
generations
if
it
were
a
case
in
which
a
man
aid
were
necessary
there
stood
sypher
a
great
pillar
of
comfort
unconsciously
she
compared
him
with
the
man
with
whom
she
had
come
in
contact
during
her
travels
and
she
had
met
many
of
great
charm
and
strength
and
knowledge
for
some
strange
reason
which
she
could
not
analyze
he
towered
above
them
all
though
in
each
separate
quality
of
character
others
whom
she
could
name
surpassed
him
far
she
knew
his
faults
and
in
her
lofty
way
smiled
at
them
her
character
as
goddess
or
guardian
angel
or
fairy
patroness
of
the
cure
she
had
assumed
with
the
graciousness
of
a
lady
playing
charades
at
a
children
party
his
occasional
lapses
from
the
traditions
of
her
class
jarred
on
her
fine
susceptibilities
yet
there
in
spite
of
all
he
stood
rooted
in
her
life
a
fact
a
puzzle
a
pride
and
a
consolation
the
other
men
paled
into
unimportant
ghosts
before
him
and
strayed
shadowy
through
the
limbo
of
her
mind
till
now
she
had
not
realized
it
septimus
however
had
always
dwelt
in
her
heart
like
a
stray
dog
whom
she
had
rescued
from
vagrancy
he
did
not
count
as
a
man
sypher
did
thus
during
the
long
tedious
hours
of
the
journey
home
the
two
were
curiously
mingled
in
her
anxious
conjectures
and
she
had
no
doubt
that
sypher
and
herself
the
strong
and
masterful
would
come
to
the
deliverance
of
the
weak
septimus
who
had
received
a
telegram
from
marseilles
waited
for
her
train
at
victoria
in
order
to
insure
being
in
time
he
had
arrived
a
couple
of
hours
too
soon
and
patiently
wandered
about
the
station
now
and
then
he
stopped
before
the
engines
of
trains
at
rest
fascinated
as
he
always
was
by
perfect
mechanism
a
driver
dismounting
from
the
cab
and
seeing
him
lost
in
admiration
of
the
engine
passed
him
a
civil
word
to
which
septimus
always
courteous
replied
they
talked
further
i
see
you
an
engineer
sir
said
the
driver
who
found
himself
in
conversation
with
an
appreciative
expert
my
father
was
said
septimus
but
i
could
never
get
up
in
time
for
my
examinations
examinations
seem
so
silly
why
should
you
tell
a
set
of
men
what
they
know
already
the
grimy
driver
expressed
the
opinion
that
examinations
were
necessary
he
who
spoke
had
passed
them
i
suppose
you
can
get
up
at
any
time
septimus
remarked
enviously
somebody
ought
to
invent
a
machine
for
those
who
ca
you
only
want
an
said
the
driver
septimus
shook
his
head
they
no
good
i
tried
one
once
but
it
made
such
a
dreadful
noise
that
i
threw
a
boot
at
it
did
that
stop
it
no
murmured
septimus
the
boot
hit
another
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
a
louis
quinze
clock
and
spoiled
it
i
did
get
up
but
i
found
the
method
too
expensive
so
i
never
tried
it
again
the
engine
of
an
outgoing
train
blew
off
steam
and
the
resounding
din
deafened
the
station
septimus
held
his
hands
to
his
ears
the
driver
grinned
i
ca
stand
that
noise
septimus
explained
when
it
was
over
once
i
tried
to
work
out
an
invention
for
modifying
it
it
was
a
kind
of
combination
between
a
gramaphone
and
an
orchestrion
you
stuck
it
inside
somewhere
and
instead
of
the
awful
screech
a
piece
of
music
would
come
out
of
the
funnel
in
fact
it
might
have
gone
on
playing
all
the
time
the
train
was
in
motion
it
would
have
been
so
cheery
for
the
drivers
it
the
unimaginative
mechanic
whose
wits
were
scattered
by
this
fantastic
proposition
used
his
bit
of
cotton
waste
as
a
handkerchief
and
remarked
with
vague
politeness
that
it
was
a
pity
the
gentleman
was
not
an
engineer
but
septimus
deprecated
the
compliment
he
looked
wistfully
up
at
the
girders
of
the
glass
roof
and
spoke
in
his
gentle
tired
voice
you
see
he
concluded
if
i
had
been
in
practice
as
an
engineer
i
should
never
have
designed
machinery
in
the
orthodox
way
i
should
have
always
put
in
little
things
of
my
own
and
then
god
knows
what
would
have
happened
he
brought
his
eyes
to
earth
with
a
wan
smile
but
his
companion
had
vanished
a
crowd
had
filled
the
suburban
platform
at
the
end
of
which
he
stood
and
in
a
few
moments
the
train
clattered
off
then
remembering
that
he
was
hungry
he
went
to
the
where
at
the
suggestion
of
the
barmaid
he
regaled
himself
on
two
eggs
and
a
glass
of
sherry
the
meal
over
he
loitered
palely
about
the
busy
station
jostled
by
frantic
gentlemen
in
silk
hats
rushing
to
catch
suburban
trains
and
watched
grimly
by
a
policeman
who
suspected
a
soul
beneath
his
guileless
exterior
at
last
by
especial
grace
of
heaven
he
found
himself
on
the
platform
where
the
barrier
and
the
long
line
of
waiting
porters
heralded
the
approach
of
the
continental
train
now
that
only
a
few
moments
separated
him
from
zora
his
heart
grew
cold
with
suspense
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
night
of
emmy
fainting
fit
her
letters
though
kind
had
made
clear
to
him
her
royal
displeasure
at
his
unceremonious
marriage
for
the
first
time
he
would
look
into
her
eyes
out
of
a
disingenuous
soul
would
she
surprise
his
guilty
secret
it
was
the
only
thing
he
feared
in
a
bewildering
world
the
train
came
in
and
as
her
carriage
flashed
by
zora
saw
him
on
the
platform
with
his
hat
off
passing
his
fingers
nervously
through
his
struwel
peter
hair
the
touch
of
the
familiar
welcoming
her
brought
moisture
to
her
eyes
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
she
alighted
and
leaving
turner
who
had
accompanied
her
on
the
pilgrimage
and
from
dover
had
breathed
fervent
thanks
to
heaven
that
at
last
she
was
back
in
the
land
of
her
fathers
to
look
after
her
luggage
she
walked
down
the
platform
to
meet
him
he
was
just
asking
a
porter
at
frantic
grapple
with
the
hand
baggage
of
a
large
family
whether
he
had
seen
a
tall
and
extraordinarily
beautiful
lady
in
the
train
when
she
came
up
to
him
with
outstretched
hands
and
beaming
eyes
he
took
the
hands
and
looked
long
at
her
unable
to
speak
never
had
she
appeared
to
him
more
beautiful
more
gracious
the
royal
waves
of
her
hair
beneath
a
fur
invested
her
with
queenliness
the
full
youth
of
her
figure
not
hidden
by
a
fur
jacket
brought
to
him
the
generous
woman
a
bunch
of
violets
at
her
bosom
suggested
the
fragrant
essence
of
her
oh
it
good
to
see
you
septimus
it
good
she
cried
the
sight
of
you
makes
me
feel
as
if
nothing
mattered
in
the
world
except
the
people
one
cares
for
how
are
you
i
very
well
indeed
said
septimus
full
of
inventions
she
laughed
and
guided
him
up
the
platform
through
the
of
porters
carrying
luggage
from
train
to
cabs
is
mother
all
right
she
asked
anxiously
oh
yes
said
septimus
and
emmy
and
the
baby
remarkably
well
emmy
has
had
him
christened
i
wanted
him
to
be
called
after
you
zoroaster
was
the
only
man
name
i
could
think
of
but
she
did
not
like
it
and
so
she
called
it
octavius
after
me
also
oldrieve
after
the
family
and
william
why
william
after
pitt
said
septimus
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
gives
the
obvious
answer
she
halted
for
a
moment
perplexed
pitt
yes
the
great
statesman
he
going
to
be
a
member
of
parliament
you
know
oh
said
zora
moving
slowly
on
his
mother
says
it
after
the
lame
donkey
on
the
common
we
used
to
call
it
william
he
has
changed
a
bit
since
you
left
so
the
baby
full
name
is
said
zora
ignoring
the
donkey
william
octavius
oldrieve
dix
it
so
helpful
to
a
child
to
have
a
good
name
i
long
to
see
him
said
zora
he
in
paris
just
now
paris
she
echoed
oh
he
not
by
himself
you
know
septimus
hastened
to
reassure
her
lest
she
might
think
that
the
babe
was
alone
among
the
temptations
and
dissipations
of
the
gay
city
his
mother
there
too
she
shook
him
by
the
what
an
exasperating
thing
you
are
why
did
you
tell
me
i
could
have
broken
my
journey
or
at
least
asked
them
to
meet
me
at
the
gare
du
nord
but
why
are
they
in
england
i
did
bring
them
with
me
she
laughed
again
at
his
tone
suspecting
nothing
you
speak
as
if
you
had
accidentally
left
them
behind
like
umbrellas
did
you
turner
came
up
attended
by
a
porter
with
the
hand
baggage
are
you
going
on
to
nunsmere
why
should
you
asked
septimus
i
had
intended
to
do
so
but
if
mother
is
quite
well
and
emmy
and
the
baby
are
in
paris
and
you
yourself
are
here
i
do
quite
see
the
necessity
it
would
be
much
nicer
if
you
remained
in
london
said
he
very
well
said
zora
we
shall
we
can
put
up
at
the
grosvenor
hotel
here
for
the
night
where
are
you
staying
septimus
murmured
the
name
of
his
sedate
club
where
his
dissolute
morning
appearance
was
still
remembered
against
him
go
and
change
and
come
back
and
dine
with
me
in
an
hour
time
he
obeyed
the
command
with
his
usual
meekness
and
zora
followed
the
porter
through
the
subway
to
the
hotel
we
have
dined
together
like
this
she
said
unfolding
her
napkin
an
hour
afterwards
since
monte
carlo
then
it
was
hopelessly
unconventional
now
we
can
dine
in
the
strictest
propriety
do
you
understand
that
my
she
laughed
radiant
curiously
happy
at
being
with
him
she
realized
with
a
little
shock
of
discovery
the
restfulness
that
was
the
essential
quality
of
his
companionship
he
was
a
quiet
haven
after
stormy
seas
he
represented
something
intimate
and
tender
in
her
life
they
spoke
for
a
while
of
common
things
her
train
journey
the
crossing
the
wonders
she
had
seen
he
murmured
incoherent
sketches
of
his
life
in
paris
the
new
gun
and
hégisippe
cruchot
but
of
the
reason
for
his
summons
he
said
nothing
at
last
she
leaned
across
the
table
and
said
gently
why
am
i
here
septimus
you
have
told
me
have
i
no
you
see
the
little
dog
tail
brought
me
to
you
but
it
gave
me
no
inkling
why
you
wanted
me
so
badly
he
looked
at
her
in
his
scared
manner
oh
i
do
want
you
at
all
at
least
i
do
most
tremendously
but
not
for
myself
for
whom
then
clem
sypher
said
septimus
she
paled
slightly
and
looked
down
at
her
plate
and
crumbled
bread
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
speak
the
announcement
did
not
surprise
her
in
an
inexplicable
way
it
seemed
natural
septimus
and
sypher
had
shared
her
thoughts
so
oddly
during
her
journey
an
unaccountable
shyness
had
checked
her
impulse
to
inquire
after
his
welfare
indeed
now
that
the
name
was
spoken
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
had
not
expected
to
hear
it
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
at
length
the
cure
has
failed
failed
she
looked
up
at
him
half
incredulously
the
very
last
letter
she
had
received
from
sypher
had
been
full
of
the
lust
of
battle
septimus
nodded
gloomily
it
was
only
a
silly
patent
ointment
like
a
hundred
others
but
it
was
sypher
religion
now
his
gods
have
gone
and
he
lost
it
not
good
for
a
man
to
have
no
gods
i
did
have
any
once
and
the
devils
came
in
they
drove
me
to
try
haschisch
but
it
must
have
been
very
bad
haschisch
for
it
made
me
sick
and
so
i
was
saved
what
made
you
send
for
me
so
urgently
the
dog
tail
you
knew
i
had
to
come
sypher
wanted
you
to
give
him
some
new
gods
he
could
have
sent
for
me
himself
why
did
he
ask
you
he
did
cried
septimus
he
does
know
anything
about
it
he
the
faintest
idea
that
you
in
london
was
i
wrong
in
bringing
you
back
to
zora
the
incomprehensible
aspect
of
the
situation
was
her
own
attitude
she
did
not
know
whether
septimus
was
wrong
or
not
she
told
herself
that
she
ought
to
resent
the
summons
which
had
caused
her
such
needless
anxiety
as
to
his
welfare
but
she
could
feel
no
resentment
sypher
had
failed
the
mighty
had
fallen
she
pictured
a
man
and
her
own
heart
ached
for
him
you
did
right
septimus
she
said
very
gently
but
of
what
use
can
i
be
to
him
septimus
said
he
the
one
to
tell
you
that
but
do
you
think
he
knows
he
did
before
he
wanted
me
to
stay
as
a
kind
of
mascotte
for
the
cure
simply
sit
still
while
he
drew
influence
out
of
me
or
something
it
was
absurd
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
septimus
made
his
one
contribution
to
pessimistic
philosophy
when
you
analyze
anything
in
life
said
he
do
you
think
that
you
always
come
down
to
a
ad
absurdum
chapter
xix
i
very
sorry
to
leave
you
sypher
said
shuttleworth
but
my
first
duty
is
to
my
wife
and
family
clem
sypher
leaned
back
in
his
chair
behind
his
great
office
desk
and
looked
at
his
melancholy
manager
with
the
eyes
of
a
general
whose
officers
refuse
the
madness
of
a
forlorn
hope
quite
so
he
said
tonelessly
when
do
you
want
to
go
you
engaged
me
on
a
notice
but
but
you
want
to
go
now
i
have
a
very
brilliant
position
offered
me
if
i
can
take
it
up
in
a
fortnight
very
well
said
sypher
you
wo
say
it
a
case
of
rats
deserting
a
sinking
ship
will
you
sir
as
i
say
my
wife
and
family
the
ship
sinking
you
quite
right
to
leave
it
is
the
position
offered
you
in
the
same
line
of
business
yes
said
shuttleworth
unable
to
meet
his
chief
clear
unsmiling
eyes
one
of
the
rival
firms
shuttleworth
nodded
then
broke
out
into
mournful
asseverations
of
loyalty
tithe
cure
had
flourished
he
would
have
stayed
with
sypher
till
the
day
of
his
death
he
would
have
refused
the
brilliant
offer
but
in
the
circumstances
qui
peut
said
sypher
another
month
or
two
and
sypher
cure
becomes
a
thing
of
the
past
nothing
can
pull
it
through
i
was
too
sanguine
i
wish
i
had
taken
your
advice
oftener
shuttleworth
shuttleworth
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
one
learns
by
experience
said
he
modestly
i
was
born
and
bred
in
the
business
it
very
risky
you
start
a
thing
it
catches
on
for
a
while
then
something
else
more
attractive
comes
on
the
market
there
a
war
of
advertising
and
the
bigger
capital
wins
the
wise
man
gets
out
of
it
just
before
the
rival
comes
if
you
had
taken
my
advice
five
years
ago
and
turned
it
into
a
company
you
have
been
a
rich
man
now
without
a
care
in
the
world
next
time
you
will
there
be
no
next
time
said
sypher
gravely
why
not
there
always
money
in
patent
medicines
for
instance
in
a
new
cure
for
obesity
if
properly
worked
a
man
like
you
can
always
get
the
money
together
and
the
cure
for
obesity
shuttleworth
dismal
face
contracted
into
the
grimace
which
passed
with
him
for
a
smile
any
old
thing
will
do
so
long
as
it
does
poison
people
uncomfortable
under
his
chief
silent
scrutiny
he
took
off
his
spectacles
breathed
on
them
and
wiped
them
with
his
handkerchief
the
public
will
buy
anything
if
you
advertise
it
enough
i
suppose
they
will
said
sypher
even
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
shuttleworth
started
and
put
on
his
spectacles
why
should
they
buy
the
remedy
after
all
you
ask
me
that
said
sypher
all
through
the
interview
he
had
not
shifted
his
position
he
sat
fixed
like
a
florid
ghost
the
manager
shuffled
uneasily
in
his
chair
beside
the
desk
and
cleared
his
throat
nervously
i
bound
to
said
he
in
i
know
what
you
think
of
the
cure
but
that
a
matter
of
sentiment
i
been
into
the
thing
pretty
thoroughly
and
i
know
that
there
scarcely
any
difference
in
the
composition
of
the
remedy
and
the
cure
after
all
any
protecting
grease
that
keeps
the
microbes
in
the
air
out
of
the
sore
place
does
just
as
well
sometimes
better
there
nothing
in
patent
ointment
that
really
cures
now
is
there
are
you
going
to
the
jebusa
jones
people
asked
sypher
i
have
my
wife
and
family
the
manager
pleaded
i
could
refuse
they
offered
me
the
position
of
their
london
agent
i
know
it
must
pain
you
he
added
hurriedly
but
what
could
i
do
every
man
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
so
you
will
give
me
what
they
used
to
call
my
de
you
just
stab
me
dead
as
i
lie
dying
well
in
a
fortnight
time
you
can
go
the
other
rose
thank
you
very
much
sypher
you
have
always
treated
me
generously
and
i
more
than
sorry
to
leave
you
you
bear
me
no
ill
will
for
going
from
one
quack
remedy
to
another
certainly
not
it
was
only
when
the
door
closed
behind
the
manager
that
sypher
relaxed
his
attitude
he
put
both
hands
up
to
his
face
and
then
fell
forward
on
to
the
desk
his
head
on
his
arms
the
end
had
come
to
that
which
mattered
in
the
man
the
lingering
faith
yet
struggling
in
the
throes
of
dissolution
shuttleworth
had
indeed
given
the
de
that
he
had
joined
the
who
in
a
short
time
would
achieve
his
material
destruction
signified
little
when
something
spiritual
is
being
done
to
death
the
body
and
mind
are
torpid
even
a
month
ago
had
shuttleworth
uttered
such
blasphemy
within
those
walls
clem
sypher
would
have
arisen
in
his
wrath
like
a
mad
crusader
and
have
cloven
the
blasphemer
from
skull
to
chine
he
had
sat
motionless
petrified
scarcely
able
to
feel
he
knew
that
the
man
spoke
truth
as
well
put
any
noxious
concoction
of
drugs
on
the
market
and
call
it
a
specific
against
obesity
or
gravel
or
deafness
as
sypher
cure
between
the
panacea
which
was
to
cleanse
the
skin
of
the
nations
and
send
his
name
ringing
down
the
centuries
as
the
friend
of
humanity
and
the
shiveringly
vulgar
jebusa
jones
cuticle
remedy
there
was
not
an
atom
of
important
difference
one
was
as
useful
or
as
useless
as
the
other
the
cure
was
pale
green
the
remedy
rose
pink
women
liked
the
latter
best
on
account
of
its
color
both
were
quack
medicaments
he
raised
a
drawn
and
agonized
face
and
looked
around
the
familiar
room
where
so
many
gigantic
schemes
had
been
laid
where
so
many
hopes
had
shone
radiant
and
saw
for
the
first
time
its
blatant
its
piteous
vulgarity
facing
him
was
the
artist
original
cartoon
for
the
great
poster
which
once
had
been
famous
all
over
the
world
and
now
for
lack
of
money
only
lingered
in
shreds
on
a
forgotten
hoarding
in
some
back
of
beyond
it
represented
the
friend
of
humanity
in
gesture
white
beard
and
general
appearance
resembling
a
benevolent
minor
prophet
distributing
the
cure
to
a
scrofulous
universe
in
those
glorified
days
he
had
striven
to
have
his
own
lineaments
depicted
above
the
robe
of
the
central
figure
but
the
artist
had
declared
them
to
be
unpictorial
and
clung
to
the
majesty
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
beard
around
the
latter
feet
were
gathered
a
motley
crew
the
fine
lady
in
her
ball
dress
the
shoeblack
the
crowned
king
the
red
indian
in
fenimore
cooper
feathers
the
negro
the
wasted
ragged
mother
with
her
babe
the
jockey
the
syrian
leper
and
a
score
of
other
types
of
humans
including
in
the
background
a
creature
the
man
of
barnum
show
they
were
well
grouped
effective
making
the
direct
appeal
to
an
populace
which
in
its
art
must
have
something
to
catch
hold
of
like
the
tannin
in
its
overdrawn
tea
it
loved
to
stand
before
this
poster
and
pick
out
the
easily
recognized
characters
and
argue
as
sypher
whose
genius
had
suggested
the
inclusion
of
the
freak
had
intended
what
the
hairy
creature
could
represent
and
as
it
stood
and
picked
and
argued
the
great
fact
of
sypher
cure
sank
deep
into
their
souls
he
remembered
the
glowing
pride
with
which
he
had
regarded
this
achievement
the
triumphal
progress
he
made
in
a
around
the
london
hoardings
the
day
after
the
poster
had
been
pasted
abroad
and
now
he
knew
it
in
his
heart
to
be
nothing
but
a
tawdry
commercial
lie
framed
in
oak
on
his
walls
hung
kindly
notes
relating
to
the
cure
from
great
personages
or
their
secretaries
at
the
bottom
of
one
ran
the
sprawling
signature
of
the
grand
duke
who
had
hailed
him
as
bon
at
the
gare
de
lyon
when
he
started
on
the
disastrous
adventure
of
the
blistered
heel
there
was
the
neatly
docketed
set
of
pigeonholes
containing
the
proofs
of
all
the
advertisements
he
had
issued
lying
before
him
on
his
desk
was
a
copy
resplendently
bound
in
morocco
for
his
own
gratification
of
the
pamphlet
which
was
wrapped
a
miracle
of
fine
folding
about
each
packet
of
the
cure
on
each
page
the
directions
for
use
were
given
in
a
separate
language
french
fijian
syrian
basque
were
there
forty
languages
so
that
all
the
sons
of
men
could
read
the
good
tidings
and
amuse
themselves
at
the
same
time
by
trying
to
decipher
the
message
in
alien
tongues
wherever
he
looked
some
mockery
of
vain
triumph
met
his
eye
an
enlargement
of
a
snapshot
photograph
of
the
arrival
of
the
first
case
of
the
cure
on
the
shores
of
lake
tchad
photographs
of
the
busy
factory
now
worked
by
a
dwindling
staff
proofs
of
advertisements
in
which
sypher
cure
and
friend
of
humanity
figured
in
large
capitals
the
model
of
edinburgh
castle
built
by
a
grateful
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
out
of
the
red
celluloid
boxes
of
the
cure
he
shuddered
at
all
these
symbols
and
images
of
false
gods
and
bowed
his
head
again
on
his
arms
the
abyss
swallowed
him
the
waters
closed
over
his
head
how
long
he
remained
like
this
he
did
not
know
he
had
forbidden
his
door
the
busy
life
of
the
office
stood
still
the
dull
roar
of
moorgate
street
was
faintly
heard
and
now
and
then
the
windows
vibrated
faintly
the
sprawling
gilt
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
had
stopped
presently
an
unusual
rustle
in
the
room
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
with
a
start
zora
middlemist
stood
before
him
he
sprang
to
his
feet
you
you
they
would
let
me
in
i
forced
my
way
i
said
i
must
see
you
he
stared
at
her
a
shivering
thrill
passed
through
him
such
as
shakes
a
man
on
the
verge
of
a
great
discovery
you
zora
you
have
come
to
me
at
this
moment
he
looked
so
strange
and
staring
so
haggard
and
disheveled
that
she
moved
quickly
to
him
and
laid
both
her
hands
on
his
my
dear
friend
my
dearest
friend
is
it
as
bad
as
that
a
throb
of
pain
underlay
the
commonplace
words
the
anguish
on
his
face
stirred
the
best
and
most
womanly
in
her
she
yearned
to
comfort
him
but
he
drew
a
pace
or
two
away
and
held
up
both
hands
as
if
warding
her
off
and
stared
at
her
still
but
with
a
new
light
in
his
clear
eyes
that
drank
in
her
beauty
and
the
sorcery
of
her
presence
my
god
he
cried
in
a
strained
voice
my
god
what
a
fool
i
been
he
swerved
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
and
sank
into
his
office
chair
and
turned
his
eyes
from
her
to
the
ground
and
sat
stunned
with
joy
and
wonder
and
misery
he
put
out
a
hand
blindly
and
she
took
it
standing
by
his
side
he
knew
now
what
he
wanted
he
wanted
her
the
woman
he
wanted
her
voice
in
his
ears
her
kiss
on
his
lips
her
dear
self
in
his
arms
he
wanted
her
welcome
as
he
entered
his
house
her
heart
her
soul
her
mind
her
body
everything
that
was
hers
he
loved
her
for
herself
passionately
overwhelmingly
after
the
simple
way
of
men
he
had
raised
his
eyes
from
the
deeps
of
hell
and
in
a
flash
she
was
revealed
to
him
incarnate
heaven
he
felt
the
touch
of
her
gloved
hand
on
his
and
it
sent
a
thrill
through
his
veins
which
almost
hurt
as
the
newly
coursing
blood
hurts
the
man
that
has
been
revived
from
torpor
the
mistiness
that
serves
a
strong
man
for
tears
clouded
his
sight
he
had
longed
for
her
she
had
come
from
their
first
meeting
he
had
recognized
with
the
visionary
glimpse
of
the
spiritual
that
she
was
the
woman
of
women
appointed
unto
him
for
help
and
comfort
but
then
the
visionary
had
eclipsed
the
man
destiny
had
naught
to
do
with
him
but
as
the
instrument
for
the
universal
spreading
of
the
cure
the
cure
was
his
life
the
woman
appointed
unto
him
was
appointed
unto
the
cure
equally
with
himself
he
had
violently
credited
her
with
his
insane
faith
he
had
craved
her
presence
as
a
mystical
influence
that
in
some
way
would
paralyze
the
jebusa
jones
dragon
and
give
him
supernatural
strength
to
fight
he
had
striven
with
all
his
power
to
keep
her
radiant
like
a
star
while
his
own
faith
lay
dying
he
had
been
a
fool
all
the
time
it
was
the
sheer
woman
that
had
held
him
the
sheer
man
and
yet
had
not
destiny
fulfilled
itself
with
a
splendid
irony
in
sending
her
to
him
then
in
that
moment
of
his
utter
anguish
of
the
utter
annihilation
of
the
fantastic
faith
whereby
he
had
lived
for
years
from
the
first
he
had
been
right
though
with
a
magnificent
lunacy
it
was
she
in
very
truth
who
had
been
destined
to
slay
his
dragon
it
was
dead
now
a
vulgar
slimy
monster
incapable
of
hurt
slain
by
the
lightning
flash
of
love
when
his
eyes
met
hers
a
moment
or
two
ago
in
a
confused
way
he
realized
this
he
repeated
mechanically
what
a
fool
i
been
what
a
fool
i
been
why
asked
zora
who
did
not
understand
because
he
began
and
then
he
stopped
finding
no
words
i
wonder
whether
god
sent
you
i
afraid
it
was
only
septimus
she
said
with
a
smile
septimus
he
was
startled
what
could
septimus
have
to
do
with
her
coming
he
rose
again
and
focusing
his
whirling
senses
on
conventional
things
wheeled
an
armchair
to
the
fire
and
led
her
to
it
and
took
his
seat
near
her
in
his
office
chair
forgive
me
he
said
but
your
coming
seemed
supernatural
i
was
dazed
by
the
wonderful
sight
of
you
perhaps
it
not
you
after
all
i
may
be
going
mad
and
have
hallucinations
tell
me
that
it
really
you
it
me
in
flesh
and
blood
you
can
touch
for
yourself
and
my
sudden
appearance
is
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
winter
in
egypt
so
did
i
until
i
reached
marseilles
this
is
how
it
was
she
told
him
of
the
tail
of
the
little
china
dog
and
of
her
talk
with
septimus
the
night
before
so
i
came
to
you
she
concluded
as
soon
as
i
decently
could
this
morning
and
i
owe
you
to
septimus
he
said
ah
i
know
you
ought
to
have
owed
me
to
yourself
she
cried
misunderstanding
him
if
i
had
known
things
were
so
terrible
with
you
i
would
have
come
i
would
really
but
i
was
misled
by
your
letters
they
were
so
hopeful
do
reproach
me
reproach
you
you
who
have
given
this
crazy
fellow
so
much
you
who
come
to
me
all
sweetness
and
graciousness
with
heaven
in
your
eyes
after
having
been
dragged
across
europe
and
made
to
sacrifice
your
winter
of
sunshine
just
for
my
sake
ah
no
it
myself
that
i
reproach
for
what
she
asked
for
being
a
fool
a
crazy
blatant
fool
my
god
he
exclaimed
smiting
the
arm
of
his
chair
as
a
new
view
of
things
suddenly
occurred
to
him
how
can
you
sit
there
how
have
you
suffered
me
these
two
years
without
despising
me
how
is
it
that
i
have
been
the
mock
and
byword
of
europe
i
must
have
been
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
in
great
agitation
these
things
have
all
come
crowding
up
together
one
ca
realize
everything
at
once
sypher
friend
of
humanity
how
they
must
have
jeered
behind
my
back
if
they
thought
me
sincere
how
they
must
have
despised
me
if
they
thought
me
nothing
but
an
advertising
quack
zora
middlemist
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
you
have
thought
of
me
what
have
you
taken
me
for
a
madman
or
a
charlatan
it
is
you
that
must
tell
me
what
has
happened
said
zora
earnestly
i
do
know
septimus
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
cure
had
failed
never
clear
about
anything
in
his
own
mind
and
he
worse
when
he
tries
to
explain
it
to
others
septimus
said
sypher
is
one
of
the
children
of
god
but
he
a
little
bit
incoherent
on
earth
she
rejoined
with
a
smile
what
has
really
happened
sypher
drew
a
long
breath
and
pulled
himself
up
i
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
the
cure
has
paid
for
the
last
two
years
i
hoped
against
hope
i
flung
thousands
and
thousands
into
the
concern
the
jebusa
jones
people
and
others
me
me
at
every
turn
now
every
bit
of
capital
is
gone
and
i
ca
raise
any
more
i
must
go
under
zora
began
i
have
a
fairly
large
fortune
he
checked
her
with
a
gesture
and
looked
at
her
clear
and
full
god
bless
you
he
said
my
heart
did
lie
to
me
at
monte
carlo
when
it
told
me
that
you
were
a
woman
tell
me
have
you
ever
believed
in
the
cure
in
the
sense
that
i
believed
in
it
zora
returned
his
gaze
here
was
no
rhodomontading
the
man
was
grappling
with
realities
no
she
replied
simply
neither
do
i
any
longer
said
sypher
there
is
no
difference
between
it
and
any
quack
ointment
you
can
buy
at
the
first
chemist
shop
that
is
why
even
if
i
saw
a
chance
of
putting
the
concern
on
its
legs
again
i
could
use
your
money
that
is
why
i
asked
you
just
now
what
you
have
thought
of
me
a
madman
or
a
quack
does
the
mere
fact
of
my
being
here
show
you
what
i
thought
of
you
forgive
me
he
said
it
wrong
to
ask
you
such
questions
it
worse
than
wrong
it
unnecessary
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
sat
down
i
gone
through
a
lot
i
not
quite
myself
so
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
say
unnecessary
things
god
sent
you
to
me
this
morning
septimus
was
his
messenger
if
you
had
appeared
just
now
i
think
i
should
have
gone
into
black
madness
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
softly
all
that
you
care
to
tell
i
am
your
nearest
friend
i
think
and
dearest
and
you
are
mine
you
and
septimus
i
seen
hundreds
of
people
since
i
been
away
and
some
seem
to
have
cared
for
me
but
there
no
one
really
in
my
life
but
you
two
sypher
thought
and
we
both
love
you
with
all
there
is
in
us
and
you
do
know
it
he
also
thought
jealously
who
are
the
people
that
have
cared
for
you
he
said
no
one
a
smile
parted
her
lips
as
she
looked
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
and
repeated
the
negative
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
for
he
had
remembered
rattenden
prophecy
of
the
big
man
whom
she
was
seeking
of
the
love
for
the
big
man
the
gorgeous
tropical
sunshine
in
which
all
the
splendor
in
her
could
develop
she
had
not
found
him
from
the
depths
of
his
egotism
he
uttered
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
tell
me
she
said
again
do
you
remember
my
letter
from
paris
in
the
summer
yes
you
had
a
great
scheme
for
the
armies
of
the
world
that
was
the
beginning
said
he
and
then
he
told
her
all
the
grotesque
story
to
the
end
from
the
episode
of
the
blistered
heel
he
told
her
things
that
he
had
never
told
himself
things
that
startled
him
when
he
found
them
expressed
in
words
in
russia
said
he
every
house
has
its
sacred
pictures
even
the
poorest
peasant
hut
they
call
them
ikons
these
waving
to
the
walls
were
my
ikons
what
do
you
think
of
them
for
the
first
time
zora
became
aware
of
the
furniture
and
decoration
of
the
room
the
cartoon
the
advertisement
proofs
the
model
of
edinburgh
castle
produced
on
her
the
same
effect
as
the
famous
board
in
the
garden
at
fenton
court
then
however
she
could
argue
with
him
on
the
question
of
taste
and
lay
down
laws
as
the
arbiter
of
the
elegancies
of
conduct
now
he
viewed
the
sorry
images
with
her
own
eyes
and
he
had
gone
through
fire
to
attain
this
clearness
of
vision
what
could
be
said
zora
the
magnificent
and
found
not
a
word
though
her
heart
was
filled
with
pity
she
was
brought
face
to
face
with
a
ridiculous
remote
from
her
poor
little
experience
of
life
it
was
no
time
to
act
the
beneficent
goddess
she
became
fearful
to
speak
lest
she
might
strike
a
wrong
note
of
sympathy
she
wanted
to
give
the
man
so
much
and
she
could
give
him
so
little
i
dying
to
help
you
she
said
rather
piteously
but
how
can
i
zora
he
said
huskily
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
he
held
her
eyes
with
his
and
she
saw
how
she
could
help
him
no
do
do
i
ca
bear
it
she
rose
and
turned
away
do
let
us
change
things
they
were
so
sweet
before
they
were
so
strange
your
wanting
me
as
a
sort
of
priestess
i
used
to
laugh
but
i
loved
it
all
the
time
that
why
i
said
i
been
a
fool
zora
the
bell
of
the
telephone
connected
with
his
manager
office
rang
jarringly
he
seized
the
transmitter
in
anger
how
dare
you
ring
me
up
when
i
gave
orders
i
was
to
be
undisturbed
i
do
care
who
wants
to
see
me
i
see
nobody
he
threw
down
the
transmitter
i
very
sorry
he
began
then
he
stopped
the
commonplace
summons
from
the
outer
world
brought
with
dismaying
suddenness
to
his
mind
the
practical
affairs
of
life
he
was
a
ruined
man
the
thought
staggered
him
how
could
he
say
to
zora
middlemist
i
am
a
beggar
i
want
to
marry
you
she
came
to
him
with
both
hands
outstretched
her
instinctive
gesture
when
her
heart
went
out
and
used
his
christian
name
for
the
first
time
clem
let
us
be
friends
good
friends
true
dear
friends
but
do
spoil
it
all
for
me
when
a
woman
infinitely
desired
pleads
like
that
with
glorious
eyes
and
her
fragrance
and
her
dearness
are
within
arm
length
a
man
has
but
to
catch
her
to
him
and
silence
her
pleadings
with
a
man
strength
and
carry
her
off
in
triumph
it
has
been
the
way
of
man
with
woman
since
the
world
began
and
sypher
knew
it
by
his
man
instinct
it
was
a
temptation
such
as
he
had
never
dreamed
was
in
the
world
he
passed
through
a
flaming
blazing
torment
of
battle
forget
what
i
have
said
zora
we
be
friends
if
you
so
wish
it
he
pressed
her
hands
and
turned
away
zora
felt
that
she
had
gained
an
empty
victory
i
ought
to
be
going
she
said
not
yet
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
like
friends
it
many
weary
months
since
i
have
seen
you
she
remained
a
little
longer
and
they
talked
quietly
of
many
things
on
bidding
her
he
said
half
playfully
i
often
wondered
why
you
have
taken
up
with
a
fellow
like
me
i
suppose
it
because
you
a
big
man

chapter
xx
septimus
walked
back
to
his
club
after
his
dinner
with
zora
blessing
his
stars
for
two
reasons
first
because
a
gracious
providence
had
restored
him
to
favor
in
his
goddess
sight
and
secondly
because
he
had
escaped
without
telling
her
of
the
sundered
lives
of
emmy
and
himself
by
the
time
he
went
to
bed
however
having
pondered
for
some
hours
over
the
interdependent
relations
between
zora
sypher
emmy
and
himself
he
had
entangled
his
mind
into
a
condition
of
intricate
complication
he
longed
to
continue
to
sun
himself
in
the
presence
of
his
divinity
but
being
a
married
man
no
matter
how
nominally
too
much
sunning
appeared
reprehensible
he
had
also
arranged
for
the
sunning
of
clem
sypher
and
was
aware
of
the
indelicacy
of
two
going
through
this
delicious
process
at
the
same
time
he
also
dreaded
the
possible
incredulity
of
zora
when
he
should
urge
the
ferociousness
of
his
domestic
demeanor
as
the
reason
for
his
living
apart
from
his
wife
the
consequence
was
that
after
a
sleepless
night
he
bolted
like
a
rabbit
to
his
burrow
at
nunsmere
at
any
rate
the
mission
of
the
dog
tail
was
accomplished
his
bolt
took
place
on
friday
on
saturday
morning
he
was
awakened
by
wiggleswick
the
latter
attire
was
not
that
of
the
perfect
valet
he
wore
an
old
colored
shirt
open
at
the
throat
a
pair
of
trousers
hitched
up
to
his
shoulder
blades
by
means
of
a
pair
of
red
braces
and
a
pair
of
dilapidated
carpet
slippers
here
a
letter
oh
post
it
said
septimus
sleepily
you
have
written
it
the
missus
has
written
it
it
has
a
french
stamp
and
the
paris
postmark
you
better
read
it
he
put
it
on
his
master
pillow
and
went
to
the
window
to
admire
the
view
septimus
aroused
read
the
letter
it
was
from
emmy
it
ran
dearest
septimus
i
ca
stand
this
loneliness
in
paris
any
longer
i
ca
i
ca
if
you
were
here
and
i
could
see
you
even
once
a
week
i
should
mind
but
to
go
on
day
after
day
indefinitely
without
a
comforting
word
from
you
is
more
than
i
can
bear
you
say
the
flat
is
ready
i
am
coming
over
at
once
with
baby
and
madame
bolivard
who
swears
she
will
never
leave
me
how
she
is
going
to
get
on
in
london
without
a
word
of
english
i
do
know
i
do
mind
if
i
meet
zora
perhaps
it
will
be
better
for
you
that
i
should
and
i
think
it
will
be
quite
safe
for
me
now
do
hate
me
and
think
me
horrid
and
selfish
my
dear
septimus
but
i
do
want
you
i
do
i
do
thanks
for
the
toy
train
baby
enjoys
the
paint
on
the
carriages
so
much
but
madame
bolivard
says
it
is
good
for
him
dear
if
i
thought
you
would
forgive
me
for
being
such
a
worry
i
would
worry
you
your
always
grateful
emmy
septimus
lit
the
pipe
of
the
night
before
that
lay
on
the
coverlet
and
becoming
aware
of
wiggleswick
disturbed
his
contemplation
of
nature
by
asking
him
if
he
had
ever
been
married
what
asked
wiggleswick
in
the
unmodulated
tone
of
the
deaf
have
you
ever
been
married
wiggleswick
heaps
of
times
said
the
old
man
dear
me
said
septimus
did
you
commit
bigamy
bigamy
no
i
buried
all
honorable
that
said
septimus
was
very
kind
of
you
it
was
out
of
gratitude
for
their
goodness
no
for
being
delivered
from
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
before
i
could
learn
the
blessedness
of
a
single
life
septimus
sighed
yet
it
must
be
very
nice
to
have
a
wife
wiggleswick
but
ai
yer
got
one
bawled
the
disreputable
of
course
of
course
said
septimus
hurriedly
i
was
thinking
of
the
people
who
had
wiggleswick
approached
his
master
bedside
with
a
mysteriously
confidential
air
do
you
think
we
all
cosy
and
comfortable
here
sir
yes
said
septimus
dubiously
well
i
for
one
have
nothing
to
complain
of
the
vittles
is
good
and
one
sleeps
warm
and
one
has
one
beer
and
regular
what
more
does
a
man
want
not
women
women
a
regrettable
hincident
are
you
cold
standing
there
in
your
shirt
sleeves
wiggleswick
asked
septimus
in
his
hesitating
way
wiggleswick
ignored
the
delicacy
of
the
suggestion
cold
no
if
i
was
cold
i
precious
soon
make
myself
warm
which
i
wish
to
remark
dix
that
now
you
parted
with
the
missus
pro
you
think
it
more
cosy
and
comfortable
i
do
say
but
if
she
came
here
i
do
my
best
willingly
i
know
my
duty
but
sir
a
woman
what
with
her
dusting
and
cleaning
and
washing
of
herself
in
hot
water
and
putting
flowers
in
mugs
do
upset
things
terrible
i
been
married
oftener
than
you
i
know
do
you
think
we
get
on
better
the
two
of
us
as
we
are
we
get
on
very
nicely
said
septimus
politely
but
i
afraid
have
to
do
some
cleaning
and
dusting
i
awfully
sorry
to
trouble
you
middlemist
has
returned
to
england
and
may
be
down
this
afternoon
a
look
of
dismay
came
over
wiggleswick
crafty
face
well
i
jiggered
i
just
jiggered
said
he
i
delighted
to
hear
it
murmured
septimus
bring
me
my
are
you
going
to
get
up
asked
wiggleswick
in
a
tone
of
disgusted
incredulity
yes
then
you
be
wanting
breakfast
oh
no
said
septimus
with
the
wan
smile
that
sometimes
flickered
over
his
features
afternoon
tea
will
do
with
some
bacon
and
eggs
and
things
the
old
man
went
out
grumbling
and
septimus
turned
to
his
letter
it
was
very
kind
of
emmy
he
thought
to
write
to
him
so
affectionately
he
spent
the
mild
autumn
morning
on
the
common
consulting
the
ducks
in
the
pond
and
seeking
inspiration
from
the
lame
donkey
his
state
of
mind
being
still
complicated
the
more
he
reflected
on
emmy
letter
and
on
wiggleswick
views
on
women
the
less
did
he
agree
with
wiggleswick
he
missed
emmy
who
had
treated
him
very
tenderly
since
their
talk
in
the
moonlight
at
and
he
missed
the
boy
who
in
the
later
days
in
paris
after
her
return
had
conceived
an
infantile
infatuation
for
him
and
would
cease
crying
or
go
to
sleep
peacefully
if
only
he
could
gather
a
clump
of
septimus
hair
in
his
tiny
fingers
he
missed
a
thousand
gossamer
trifles
each
one
so
imperceptible
all
added
together
so
significant
he
was
not
in
the
least
cosy
and
comfortable
with
his
old
villain
of
a
thus
he
looked
forward
in
his
twilight
way
to
emmy
coming
he
would
live
perhaps
sometimes
in
nunsmere
and
sometimes
in
london
quite
lately
on
visiting
his
bankers
in
order
to
make
arrangements
for
the
disposal
of
his
income
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
rich
he
was
and
the
manager
an
astoundingly
person
explained
that
a
commercial
concern
in
which
he
held
many
shares
had
reached
such
a
pitch
of
prosperity
as
to
treble
his
dividends
he
went
away
with
the
vague
notion
that
commercial
companies
were
models
of
altruistic
generosity
the
main
point
however
made
clear
by
the
exceptionally
intelligent
manager
being
that
he
was
richer
by
several
hundreds
a
year
he
began
to
dream
of
a
more
resplendent
residence
for
emmy
and
the
boy
than
the
little
flat
in
chelsea
he
had
observed
that
there
were
very
nice
houses
in
berkeley
square
he
wondered
how
much
a
year
they
were
with
rates
and
taxes
for
himself
he
could
perch
in
any
attic
close
by
he
resolved
to
discuss
berkeley
square
with
emmy
as
soon
as
she
arrived
william
octavius
oldrieve
dix
member
of
parliament
ought
to
start
life
in
proper
surroundings
clem
sypher
down
for
the
at
penton
court
burst
in
upon
him
during
the
afternoon
he
came
with
exciting
news
the
high
official
in
the
ordnance
department
of
the
war
office
had
written
to
him
that
morning
to
the
effect
that
he
was
so
greatly
impressed
by
the
new
gun
that
he
proposed
to
experiment
forthwith
and
desired
to
be
put
into
communication
with
the
inventor
that
very
nice
said
septimus
but
shall
i
have
to
go
and
see
him
of
course
cried
sypher
you
have
to
interview
boards
and
gunners
and
engineers
and
superintend
experiments
you
be
a
person
of
tremendous
importance
oh
dear
said
septimus
i
could
i
could
really
he
was
at
the
notion
you
have
to
laughed
sypher
septimus
clutched
at
straws
i
afraid
i
shall
be
too
busy
emmy
coming
to
london
and
there
the
boy
education
you
see
he
has
to
go
to
cambridge
look
here
he
added
a
brilliant
idea
occurring
to
him
fearfully
rich
i
do
want
any
more
money
i
sell
you
the
thing
outright
for
the
two
hundred
pounds
you
advanced
me
and
then
i
sha
have
anything
more
to
do
with
it
i
think
before
you
make
any
proposals
of
the
kind
you
ought
to
consult
dix
said
sypher
with
a
laugh
or
zora
or
zora
said
sypher
she
came
down
by
the
same
train
as
i
did
i
told
her
the
good
news
she
was
delighted
he
did
not
inform
septimus
that
for
all
her
delight
zora
had
been
somewhat
sceptical
she
loved
septimus
she
admitted
but
his
effectuality
in
any
sphere
of
human
endeavor
was
unimaginable
could
anything
good
come
out
of
nazareth
about
half
an
hour
later
the
goddess
herself
arrived
shown
in
by
wiggleswick
who
had
been
snatching
the
pipe
of
the
by
the
she
looked
flushed
resolute
indignant
and
on
seeing
sypher
she
paused
for
a
second
on
the
threshold
then
she
entered
sypher
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
no
no
you
had
better
stay
you
may
help
us
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
septimus
heart
sank
he
knew
what
it
meant
yes
sypher
knows
i
told
him
but
why
did
you
tell
me
dear
septimus
instead
of
letting
me
hear
of
it
from
mother
and
cousin
jane
i
do
think
it
was
loyal
to
me
i
forgot
said
septimus
in
desperation
you
see
i
sometimes
remember
it
and
sometimes
forget
it
i
not
used
to
getting
married
wiggleswick
has
been
married
several
times
he
was
giving
me
a
lot
of
advice
this
morning
anyhow
it
true
asked
zora
disregarding
wiggleswick
oh
yes
you
see
my
ungovernable
temper
your
what
it
was
no
use
on
receiving
the
announcement
she
looked
just
as
he
had
expected
her
to
look
he
tried
to
stammer
out
his
catalogue
of
infamies
but
failed
she
burst
out
laughing
and
sypher
who
knew
all
and
was
anxiously
wondering
how
to
save
the
situation
laughed
too
my
poor
dear
septimus
she
said
kindly
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
the
woman
who
could
get
on
with
you
must
be
a
virago
i
do
care
whether
she
my
own
sister
or
not
she
is
treating
you
abominably
but
indeed
she
not
pleaded
poor
septimus
we
the
best
of
friends
i
really
want
to
live
like
this
i
do
i
ca
live
without
wiggleswick
see
how
cosy
and
comfortable
he
makes
me
zora
looked
round
and
the
cosiness
and
comfort
made
her
gasp
cobwebs
hung
from
the
old
oak
beams
across
the
ceiling
a
day
or
two
ashes
defiled
the
grate
the
windows
were
splashed
with
mud
and
rain
there
were
no
curtains
her
finger
drawn
along
the
green
baize
revealed
the
dust
a
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
on
the
mantelpiece
were
stained
an
iridescent
brown
the
mirror
was
in
the
corner
of
the
room
a
tray
held
the
remains
of
the
last
meal
and
a
plate
containing
broken
food
had
overflowed
onto
a
neighboring
chair
an
odd
uncleaned
boot
lay
like
a
frowsy
drunken
visitor
on
the
floor
the
springs
of
the
armchair
on
which
she
sat
were
broken
it
not
fit
for
a
pig
to
live
in
she
declared
it
a
crime
to
leave
you
to
that
worthless
old
scoundrel
i
talk
to
him
before
i
go
he
like
it
and
then
i
write
to
emmy
if
that
has
no
effect
i
go
over
to
paris
and
bring
her
to
her
senses
she
had
arrived
royally
indignant
having
had
a
pitched
battle
with
cousin
jane
who
took
emmy
side
and
alluded
to
septimus
in
terms
of
withering
contempt
now
she
was
furiously
angry
the
two
men
looked
at
her
with
wistful
adoration
for
when
zora
was
furious
in
a
good
cause
she
was
very
beautiful
and
the
adoration
in
each
man
heart
was
intensified
by
the
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
futility
of
her
noble
rage
it
was
for
her
own
sake
that
the
situation
had
arisen
over
which
she
made
such
a
pother
and
she
was
gloriously
unconscious
of
it
sypher
could
not
speak
lest
he
should
betray
his
knowledge
of
septimus
secret
and
septimus
could
only
murmur
incoherent
ineffectualities
concerning
the
perfection
of
emmy
the
worthlessness
of
himself
and
the
diamond
soul
that
lodged
in
forbidding
body
zora
would
not
listen
to
unreason
it
was
emmy
duty
to
save
her
husband
from
the
dust
and
ashes
of
his
present
cosiness
if
she
could
do
nothing
else
for
him
and
she
zora
in
her
magnificence
was
going
to
see
that
emmy
duty
was
performed
instead
of
writing
she
would
start
the
next
morning
for
paris
it
would
be
well
if
septimus
could
accompany
her
dix
is
coming
to
london
i
believe
said
sypher
zora
looked
inquiringly
at
septimus
who
explained
dis
cursively
zora
renounced
paris
she
would
wait
for
emmy
for
the
time
being
the
incident
was
closed
septimus
in
his
hospitality
offered
tea
i
get
it
for
you
said
zora
it
will
be
a
good
opportunity
to
speak
sweetly
to
wiggleswick
she
swept
out
of
the
room
the
two
men
lit
cigarettes
and
smoked
for
a
while
in
silence
at
last
sypher
asked
what
made
you
send
her
the
tail
of
the
little
dog
septimus
reddened
and
ran
two
of
the
fingers
of
the
hand
holding
the
cigarette
up
his
hair
and
spilled
half
an
inch
of
ash
on
his
head
i
broke
the
dog
you
see
he
explained
luminously
i
knocked
it
off
the
mantelpiece
i
always
doing
it
when
emmy
has
a
decent
house
i
invent
something
to
keep
dogs
and
things
on
mantelpieces
sypher
said
do
you
know
you
done
me
one
of
those
services
which
one
man
rarely
does
for
another
i
never
forget
it
to
my
dying
day
by
bringing
her
to
me
you
saved
my
reason
you
made
me
a
different
being
i
clem
sypher
but
by
god
you
the
friend
of
humanity
septimus
looked
at
him
with
the
terrified
expression
of
a
mediæval
wrongdoer
writhing
under
an
ecclesiastical
curse
he
made
abject
apology
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
do
said
he
of
course
it
was
and
that
why
you
did
it
i
never
dreamed
when
you
told
me
to
wait
until
i
saw
her
before
going
mad
or
breaking
my
heart
that
you
meant
to
send
for
her
it
has
set
me
in
front
of
a
new
universe
he
rose
and
stretched
his
large
limbs
and
smiled
confidently
at
the
world
out
of
his
clear
blue
eyes
two
little
words
of
zora
had
inspired
him
with
the
old
and
sense
of
predestination
to
great
things
out
of
her
own
mouth
had
come
the
words
which
when
they
had
come
out
of
rattenden
had
made
his
heart
sink
in
despair
she
had
called
him
a
big
man
like
many
big
men
he
was
superstitious
he
believed
prophetic
utterance
concerning
zora
he
was
indeed
set
in
front
of
a
new
universe
and
septimus
had
done
it
by
means
of
the
tail
of
a
little
china
dog
as
he
was
stretching
himself
wiggleswick
shambled
in
with
the
fear
of
zora
written
on
his
wrinkled
brow
and
removed
the
tray
and
the
plate
of
broken
victuals
what
had
passed
between
them
neither
he
nor
zora
would
afterwards
relate
but
wiggleswick
spent
the
whole
of
that
night
and
the
following
days
in
unremitting
industry
so
that
the
house
became
spick
and
span
as
his
own
prison
cells
there
also
was
a
light
of
triumph
in
zora
eyes
when
she
entered
a
few
moments
afterwards
with
the
which
caused
sypher
to
smile
and
a
wicked
feeling
of
content
to
enter
septimus
mild
bosom
i
think
it
was
high
time
i
came
home
she
remarked
pouring
out
the
tea
the
two
men
supported
the
proposition
the
western
hemisphere
where
she
had
tarried
so
long
could
get
on
very
well
by
itself
in
the
meantime
the
old
eastern
hemisphere
had
been
going
to
pieces
they
had
a
gay
little
meal
now
that
zora
had
settled
wiggleswick
arranged
her
plan
of
campaign
against
emmy
and
established
very
agreeable
and
subtle
relations
between
sypher
and
herself
she
could
afford
to
shed
all
her
charm
and
gaiety
and
graciousness
on
her
subjects
she
was
infinitely
glad
to
be
with
them
again
nunsmere
had
unaccountably
expanded
she
breathed
freely
and
no
longer
knocked
her
head
against
beams
in
bedroom
ceilings
she
rallied
septimus
on
his
new
gun
he
afraid
of
it
said
sypher
what
afraid
of
its
going
off
she
laughed
oh
no
said
septimus
i
heard
lots
of
them
go
off
when
asked
zora
septimus
reddened
and
for
once
was
at
a
loss
for
one
of
the
curiously
evasive
answers
in
which
his
timidity
took
refuge
he
fidgeted
in
his
chair
zora
repeated
her
jesting
question
was
it
when
they
were
firing
royal
salutes
in
james
park
no
said
septimus
his
back
being
against
the
fading
light
she
could
not
perceive
the
discomfiture
on
his
face
she
longed
to
elicit
some
fantastic
irrelevance
well
where
was
it
why
this
mystery
i
tell
you
two
said
septimus
i
never
told
you
before
in
fact
i
never
told
any
one
not
even
wiggleswick
i
do
like
to
think
of
it
it
hurts
you
may
have
wondered
how
i
ever
got
any
practical
acquaintance
with
gunnery
i
once
held
a
commission
in
the
militia
garrison
artillery
that
how
i
came
to
love
guns
by
why
should
that
pain
you
my
dear
septimus
asked
zora
they
said
i
was
incompetent
he
murmured
brokenly
and
took
away
my
commission
the
colonel
said
i
was
a
disgrace
to
the
service
clem
sypher
smote
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
started
up
in
his
wrath
by
heavens
i
make
the
blundering
idiot
eat
his
words
i
ram
them
down
his
throat
with
the
cleaner
of
the
new
gun
i
make
you
the
biggest
ornament
the
service
ever
possessed
i
devote
my
existence
to
it
the
dix
gun
shall
wipe
humanity
off
the
face
of
the
earth
i
do
want
it
to
do
that
said
septimus
meekly
zora
begged
his
forgiveness
very
sweetly
for
her
indiscretion
and
having
comforted
him
with
glowing
prophecies
of
fame
and
domestic
happiness
went
home
with
a
full
heart
she
loved
sypher
for
his
generous
outburst
she
was
deeply
touched
by
septimus
tragic
story
but
having
a
sense
of
humor
she
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
the
thought
of
septimus
in
uniform
handling
a
battery
of
artillery
chapter
xxi
cousin
jane
was
for
packing
her
boxes
and
departing
but
zora
bade
her
remain
until
her
own
plans
were
settled
as
soon
as
emmy
arrived
she
would
have
to
go
to
london
and
play
fairy
godmother
a
proceeding
which
might
take
up
considerable
time
oldrieve
commended
her
beneficent
intention
and
besought
her
to
bring
the
irreligiously
wedded
pair
to
the
vicar
and
have
them
wedded
in
a
respectable
anglican
way
she
was
firmly
convinced
that
if
this
were
done
nothing
more
could
possibly
be
heard
of
separate
lives
zora
promised
to
do
her
best
but
cousin
jane
continued
to
sniff
it
would
be
far
better
she
declared
to
shut
the
man
up
in
an
idiot
asylum
and
bring
emmy
to
nunsmere
where
the
child
could
have
a
decent
upbringing
zora
dissented
loftily
but
declined
to
be
led
into
a
profitless
argument
all
i
ask
of
you
my
dear
jane
said
she
is
to
take
care
of
mother
a
little
longer
while
i
do
what
i
consider
my
duty
she
did
not
inform
cousin
jane
that
a
certain
freedom
of
movements
was
also
rendered
desirable
by
what
she
considered
her
duty
to
clem
sypher
cousin
jane
lacked
the
finer
threads
of
apprehension
and
her
comments
might
have
been
crude
when
zora
announced
her
intention
to
sypher
of
leading
a
migratory
existence
between
london
and
nunsmere
for
the
sakes
of
emmy
and
himself
he
burst
into
a
panegyric
on
her
angelic
nature
her
presence
would
irradiate
these
last
dark
days
of
disaster
for
the
time
was
quickly
approaching
when
the
bermondsey
factory
would
be
closed
down
and
cure
would
fade
away
from
the
knowledge
of
men
have
you
thought
of
the
future
of
what
you
are
going
to
do
she
asked
no
said
he
but
i
have
faith
in
my
destiny
zora
felt
this
to
be
magnificent
but
scarcely
practical
you
be
without
resources
i
never
realized
how
full
empty
pockets
could
be
he
declared
they
were
walking
across
the
common
sypher
having
lunched
at
the
nook
presently
they
came
across
septimus
sitting
by
the
pond
he
rose
and
greeted
them
he
wore
an
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
and
a
cloth
cap
zora
quick
eyes
noted
an
absence
of
detail
in
his
attire
why
you
not
dressed
oh
you
do
want
a
wife
to
look
after
you
i
only
just
got
up
he
explained
and
wiggleswick
wanted
to
do
out
my
bedroom
so
i
had
time
to
find
my
studs
i
was
thinking
all
night
you
see
and
one
ca
think
and
sleep
at
the
same
time
a
new
invention
laughed
zora
no
the
old
ones
i
was
trying
to
count
them
up
i
taken
out
about
fifty
patents
and
there
are
heaps
of
things
half
worked
out
which
might
be
valuable
now
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
made
them
all
over
to
sypher
he
might
get
in
some
practical
fellow
to
set
them
right
and
start
companies
and
things
to
work
them
and
so
make
a
lot
of
money
he
took
off
his
cap
and
ran
his
hand
up
his
hair
there
also
the
new
gun
i
do
wish
you
have
that
too
he
added
anxiously
in
fact
it
was
our
talk
yesterday
that
put
the
other
idea
into
my
head
sypher
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
called
him
his
dear
generous
fellow
but
how
could
he
accept
they
not
all
rot
said
septimus
pleadingly
there
a
patent
corkscrew
which
works
beautifully
wiggleswick
always
uses
it
sypher
laughed
well
i
tell
you
what
we
can
do
we
can
get
a
syndicate
together
to
run
the
dix
inventions
and
pay
you
royalties
on
sales
that
seems
a
very
good
idea
said
zora
judicially
but
septimus
looked
dissatisfied
i
wanted
to
give
them
to
sypher
said
he
zora
reminded
him
laughingly
that
he
would
have
to
provide
for
the
future
member
of
parliament
election
expenses
the
royalties
would
come
in
handy
she
could
not
take
septimus
inventions
seriously
but
sypher
spoke
of
them
later
in
his
enthusiastic
way
who
knows
there
may
be
things
hidden
among
his
models
and
specifications
of
enormous
commercial
value
lots
of
his
inventions
are
crazy
but
some
are
bound
to
be
practical
this
field
gun
for
instance
the
genius
who
could
have
hit
on
that
is
capable
of
inventing
anything
why
should
i
devote
my
life
to
spreading
the
dix
inventions
over
the
earth
it
a
colossal
idea
not
one
invention
but
fifty
from
a
corkscrew
to
a
machine
gun
it
better
than
sypher
cure
is
it
she
glanced
swiftly
at
him
to
see
whether
the
last
words
were
spoken
in
bitterness
they
were
not
his
face
beamed
as
it
had
beamed
in
the
days
when
he
had
rhapsodied
over
the
vision
of
an
earth
one
scab
to
be
healed
by
sypher
cure
say
you
think
it
better
he
urged
yes
it
better
she
assented
but
it
chimerical
so
are
all
the
dreams
ever
dreamed
by
man
i
should
like
to
pass
my
life
without
dreams
zora
i
could
give
up
tobacco
and
alcohol
and
clean
collars
and
servants
and
everything
you
could
think
of
but
not
dreams
without
them
the
earth
is
just
a
sort
of
backyard
of
a
place
and
with
them
said
zora
an
infinite
garden
i
afraid
you
be
disillusioned
over
poor
septimus
she
said
but
i
should
like
you
to
take
up
anything
you
did
believe
in
what
would
be
quite
honest
in
another
man
would
be
honest
in
you
that
means
said
sypher
you
would
like
to
see
me
going
on
dealing
in
quack
medicines
zora
flushed
red
it
was
at
the
back
of
my
mind
she
confessed
but
i
did
put
my
thoughts
into
the
form
of
a
compliment
zora
said
he
if
i
fell
below
what
i
want
to
appear
in
your
eyes
i
should
lose
the
dearest
dream
of
all
in
the
evening
came
septimus
to
penton
court
to
discuss
the
new
scheme
with
sypher
wiggleswick
with
the
fear
of
zora
heavy
upon
him
had
laid
out
his
master
dinner
suit
and
septimus
had
meekly
put
it
on
he
had
also
dined
in
a
christian
fashion
for
the
old
villain
could
cook
a
plain
dinner
creditably
when
he
chose
septimus
proclaimed
the
regeneration
of
his
body
servant
as
one
of
the
innumerable
debts
he
owed
to
zora
why
do
you
repay
them
to
me
asked
sypher
then
he
rose
laughed
into
the
distressed
face
and
put
both
his
hands
on
septimus
shoulders
no
do
try
to
answer
i
know
more
about
you
than
you
can
possibly
conceive
and
to
me
you
transparency
itself
but
you
see
that
i
accept
your
patents
do
you
i
shall
never
do
anything
with
them
have
you
tried
no
then
i
will
it
will
be
a
partnership
between
my
business
knowledge
and
energy
and
your
brains
that
will
be
right
and
honorable
for
the
two
of
us
septimus
yielded
if
both
you
and
zora
think
so
it
must
be
he
said
but
in
his
heart
he
was
disappointed
a
few
days
afterwards
shuttleworth
came
into
sypher
office
with
an
expression
of
cheerfulness
on
his
dismal
countenance
can
i
have
a
few
moments
with
you
sir
sypher
bade
him
be
seated
since
his
defection
to
the
enemy
shuttleworth
had
avoided
his
chief
as
much
as
possible
the
excess
of
sorrow
over
anger
in
the
latter
demeanor
toward
him
being
hard
to
bear
he
had
slunk
about
not
daring
to
meet
his
eyes
this
morning
however
he
reeked
of
conscious
virtue
i
have
a
proposal
to
put
before
you
with
which
i
think
you
be
pleased
said
he
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
sypher
i
proud
to
say
continued
shuttleworth
that
it
was
my
suggestion
and
that
i
carried
it
through
i
was
anxious
to
show
you
that
i
ungrateful
for
all
your
past
kindnesses
and
my
leaving
you
was
not
as
disloyal
as
you
may
have
thought
i
never
accused
you
of
disloyalty
said
sypher
you
had
your
wife
and
children
you
did
the
only
thing
possible
you
take
a
load
off
my
mind
said
shuttleworth
he
drew
a
long
breath
as
though
relieved
from
an
intolerable
burden
what
is
your
proposal
asked
sypher
i
am
authorized
by
the
jebusa
jones
company
to
approach
you
with
regard
to
a
most
advantageous
arrangement
for
both
parties
it
your
present
intention
to
close
down
the
factory
and
shut
up
this
office
as
soon
as
things
can
be
wound
up
that
my
intention
said
sypher
you
come
out
of
it
solvent
with
just
a
thousand
pounds
or
so
in
your
pocket
the
cure
will
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
quite
so
said
sypher
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
held
an
ivory
in
both
hands
but
would
that
be
an
enormous
pity
said
shuttleworth
the
cure
is
known
far
and
wide
economically
financed
and
put
more
or
less
out
of
reach
of
competition
it
can
still
be
a
most
valuable
property
now
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
no
reason
why
the
jebusa
jones
company
could
not
run
sypher
cure
side
by
side
with
the
cuticle
remedy
they
agree
with
me
they
are
willing
to
come
to
terms
whereby
they
will
take
over
the
whole
concern
as
it
stands
with
your
name
of
course
and
advertisements
and
and
pay
you
a
percentage
of
the
profits
sypher
made
no
reply
the
ivory
snapped
and
he
laid
the
pieces
absently
on
his
desk
the
advantage
to
you
is
obvious
remarked
shuttleworth
who
was
beginning
to
grow
uneasy
before
the
attitude
of
his
chief
quite
obvious
said
sypher
then
after
a
pause
do
they
propose
to
ask
me
to
manage
the
sypher
cure
branch
the
irony
was
lost
on
shuttleworth
no
well
not
exactly
he
stammered
sypher
laughed
grimly
and
checked
further
explanations
that
was
a
joke
shuttleworth
have
you
noticed
that
my
jokes
are
always
rather
subtle
no
of
course
you
are
to
manage
the
cure
i
know
nothing
about
that
sir
said
shuttleworth
hastily
sypher
rose
and
walked
about
the
room
saying
nothing
and
his
manager
followed
him
anxiously
with
his
eyes
presently
he
paused
before
the
cartoon
of
the
famous
poster
this
would
be
taken
over
with
the
rest
i
suppose
so
it
valuable
part
of
the
and
the
model
of
edinburgh
castle
and
the
autograph
testimonials
and
the
sypher
friend
of
humanity
the
model
is
much
use
of
course
you
could
keep
that
as
a
curiosity
in
the
middle
of
my
table
said
sypher
ironically
shuttleworth
smiled
guessing
that
the
remark
was
humorous
well
he
said
that
as
you
please
but
the
name
and
title
naturally
are
the
essence
of
the
matter
i
see
said
sypher
sypher
friend
of
humanity
is
the
essence
of
the
matter
with
the
secret
recipe
of
course
of
course
said
sypher
absently
he
paced
the
room
once
or
twice
then
halted
in
front
of
shuttleworth
looked
at
him
fixedly
for
a
second
or
two
out
of
his
clear
eyes
and
resumed
his
walk
which
was
disconcerting
for
shuttleworth
who
wiped
his
spectacles
do
you
think
we
might
now
go
into
some
details
with
regard
to
terms
no
said
sypher
stopping
short
of
the
fireplace
i
do
i
got
to
agree
to
the
principle
first
but
surely
there
no
difficulty
about
that
cried
shuttleworth
rising
in
consternation
i
can
see
no
earthly
reason
i
do
suppose
you
can
said
sypher
when
do
you
want
an
answer
as
soon
as
possible
come
to
me
in
an
hour
time
and
i
give
it
you
shuttleworth
retired
sypher
sat
at
his
desk
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
struggled
with
his
soul
which
as
all
the
world
knows
is
the
most
uncomfortable
thing
a
man
has
to
harbor
in
his
bosom
after
a
few
minutes
he
rang
up
a
number
on
the
telephone
are
you
the
shaftesbury
club
is
septimus
dix
in
he
knew
that
septimus
was
staying
at
the
club
as
he
had
come
to
town
to
meet
emmy
who
had
arrived
the
evening
before
from
paris
dix
was
in
he
was
just
finishing
breakfast
and
would
come
to
the
telephone
sypher
waited
with
his
ear
to
the
receiver
is
that
you
septimus
it
clem
sypher
speaking
i
want
you
to
come
to
moorgate
street
at
once
it
a
matter
of
immediate
urgency
get
into
a
hansom
and
tell
the
man
to
drive
like
the
devil
thanks
he
resumed
his
position
and
sat
motionless
until
about
half
an
hour
later
septimus
very
much
scared
was
shown
into
the
room
i
felt
sure
you
were
in
i
felt
sure
you
would
come
there
a
destiny
about
all
this
business
and
i
seem
to
have
a
peep
into
it
i
am
going
to
make
myself
the
damnedest
fool
of
all
created
beings
the
very
damnedest
septimus
murmured
that
he
was
sorry
to
hear
it
i
hoped
you
might
be
glad
said
sypher
it
depends
upon
the
kind
of
fool
you
going
to
make
of
yourself
cried
septimus
a
ray
of
wonderful
lucidity
flashing
across
his
mind
there
a
couplet
of
tennyson
i
do
read
poetry
you
know
he
broke
off
apologetically
except
a
little
persian
i
a
hard
scientific
person
all
machinery
my
father
used
to
throw
poetry
books
into
the
fire
if
he
caught
me
with
one
but
my
mother
used
to
read
to
me
now
and
then
oh
yes
tennyson
it
goes
called
me
in
the
public
squares
the
fool
that
wears
a
crown
of
that
the
best
kind
of
a
fool
to
be
he
suddenly
looked
round
dear
me
i
left
my
umbrella
in
the
cab
the
worst
kind
of
a
fool
to
be
he
smiled
wanly
dropped
his
bowler
hat
on
the
floor
and
eventually
sat
down
i
want
to
tell
you
something
said
sypher
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
i
just
had
an
offer
from
the
jebusa
jones
company
septimus
listened
intently
while
he
told
the
story
wondering
greatly
why
he
of
all
unbusinesslike
unpractical
people
in
spite
of
his
friendship
with
sypher
should
be
summoned
so
urgently
to
hear
it
if
he
had
suspected
that
in
reality
he
was
playing
the
part
of
an
animated
conscience
he
would
have
shriveled
up
through
fright
and
confusion
said
sypher
if
i
accept
this
offer
i
shall
have
a
fair
income
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
can
go
where
i
like
and
do
what
i
like
not
a
soul
can
call
my
commercial
honesty
in
question
no
business
man
in
his
senses
would
refuse
it
if
i
decline
i
start
the
world
again
with
empty
pockets
what
shall
i
do
tell
me
i
said
septimus
with
his
usual
gesture
of
diffidence
i
such
a
silly
ass
in
such
things
never
mind
said
sypher
i
do
just
what
you
would
do
septimus
reflected
and
said
hesitatingly
i
think
i
should
do
what
zora
would
like
she
does
mind
empty
pockets
sypher
dashed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
broke
into
a
loud
cry
i
knew
you
would
say
that
i
brought
you
here
to
say
it
thank
god
i
love
her
septimus
i
love
her
with
every
fiber
in
me
if
i
had
sold
my
name
to
these
people
i
should
have
sold
my
honor
i
should
have
sold
my
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
i
could
have
looked
her
in
the
face
again
whether
she
will
marry
me
or
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
your
case
you
would
have
been
the
best
kind
of
fool
and
so
shall
i
he
swung
about
the
room
greatly
excited
his
ebullient
nature
finding
in
words
relief
from
past
tension
he
laughed
aloud
proclaimed
his
love
for
zora
shook
his
somewhat
bewildered
friend
by
the
hand
and
informed
him
that
he
septimus
alone
of
mortals
was
responsible
for
the
great
decision
and
while
septimus
wondered
what
the
deuce
he
meant
he
rang
the
bell
and
summoned
shuttleworth
the
dismal
manager
entered
the
room
on
seeing
sypher
cheery
face
his
own
brightened
i
thought
the
matter
over
shuttleworth
and
you
decided
to
refuse
the
offer
absolutely
the
manager
gasped
but
sypher
have
you
reflected
my
good
shuttleworth
said
sypher
in
all
the
years
we
worked
together
have
you
ever
known
me
to
say
i
made
up
my
mind
when
i
have
shuttleworth
marched
out
of
the
room
and
banged
the
door
and
went
forth
to
declare
to
the
world
his
opinion
of
clem
sypher
he
had
always
been
half
crazy
now
he
had
gone
stick
stark
staring
raving
biting
mad
and
those
to
whom
he
told
the
tale
agreed
with
him
but
sypher
laughed
his
great
laugh
poor
shuttleworth
he
has
worked
hard
to
bring
off
this
deal
i
sorry
for
him
but
one
ca
serve
god
and
mammon
septimus
rose
and
took
his
hat
i
think
it
awfully
wonderful
of
you
he
said
i
really
do
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
but
i
must
go
and
see
emmy
she
came
last
night
sypher
inquired
politely
after
her
health
also
that
of
her
baby
he
taking
such
a
deuce
of
a
time
to
grow
up
said
septimus
otherwise
he
well
he
got
a
tooth
i
been
wondering
why
no
dentist
has
ever
invented
a
set
of
false
teeth
for
babies
then
your
turn
would
come
laughed
sypher
for
you
would
have
to
invent
them
a
inside
before
septimus
went
sypher
thrust
a
umbrella
into
his
hands
it
pouring
with
rain
and
you
wade
about
and
get
wet
through
i
make
a
rule
never
to
lend
umbrellas
so
i
give
you
this
from
a
grateful
heart
god
bless
you
chapter
xxii
the
little
flat
in
chelsea
cleaned
swept
and
garnished
by
the
wife
of
the
porter
of
the
mansions
received
emmy
her
babe
madame
bolivard
and
multitudinous
luggage
all
the
pretty
fripperies
and
frivolities
had
been
freshened
and
refurbished
since
their
desecration
at
alien
hands
and
the
place
looked
cheery
and
homelike
but
emmy
found
it
surprisingly
small
and
was
amazed
to
discover
the
prodigious
space
taken
up
by
the
baby
when
she
drew
septimus
attention
to
this
phenomenon
he
accounted
for
it
by
saying
that
it
was
because
he
had
such
a
very
big
name
which
was
an
excellent
thing
in
that
it
would
enable
him
to
occupy
a
great
deal
of
room
in
the
universe
when
he
grew
up
she
busied
herself
all
the
morning
about
the
flat
happier
than
she
had
been
for
a
whole
year
her
days
of
hagardom
were
over
the
menacing
shadow
of
the
finger
of
scorn
pointing
at
her
from
every
airt
of
heaven
had
disappeared
a
clear
sky
welcomed
her
as
she
came
back
to
take
up
an
acknowledged
position
in
the
world
the
sense
of
release
from
an
intolerable
ban
outweighed
the
bitterness
of
old
associations
she
was
at
home
in
london
among
dear
familiar
things
and
faces
she
was
almost
happy
when
madame
bolivard
appeared
with
bonnet
and
basket
undismayedly
prepared
to
market
for
lunch
and
dinner
she
laughed
like
a
schoolgirl
and
made
her
repeat
the
list
of
english
words
she
had
taught
her
in
view
of
this
contingency
she
could
say
cabbage
sugar
lettuce
and
ask
for
all
sorts
of
things
but
suppose
you
lose
your
way
madame
bolivard
i
shall
find
it
madame
but
how
will
you
ask
for
directions
you
know
you
ca
say
mansions
madame
bolivard
made
a
hopeless
spluttering
sound
as
if
she
were
blowing
teeth
out
of
her
mouth
which
in
no
wise
resembled
the
name
of
the
place
wherein
she
dwelt
but
madame
bolivard
as
has
been
remarked
was
a
and
donc
this
was
the
least
of
the
difficulties
she
had
had
to
encounter
during
her
life
emmy
bade
her
godspeed
in
her
perils
among
the
greengrocers
she
went
blithely
about
her
household
tasks
and
sang
and
cooed
deliciously
to
the
child
lying
in
its
bassinette
every
now
and
then
she
looked
at
the
clock
over
the
mantelpiece
wondering
why
septimus
had
not
come
only
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
depths
which
humans
in
their
life
dare
not
sound
too
frequently
did
she
confess
how
foolishly
she
longed
for
him
he
was
late
with
emmy
septimus
never
broke
an
appointment
to
insure
his
being
at
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time
to
meet
her
he
took
the
most
ingenious
and
complicated
precautions
before
now
he
had
dressed
overnight
and
gone
to
sleep
in
his
clothes
so
as
to
be
ready
when
the
servant
called
him
in
the
morning
emmy
knowing
this
after
the
way
of
women
began
to
grow
anxious
when
therefore
she
opened
the
flat
door
to
him
she
upbraided
him
with
considerable
tenderness
it
was
clem
sypher
he
explained
taking
off
his
overcoat
he
sent
for
me
he
wanted
me
badly
why
i
do
know
at
least
i
do
half
know
but
the
other
half
i
do
he
a
magnificent
fellow
a
little
later
after
septimus
had
inspected
her
morning
work
in
the
flat
and
the
night
progress
in
the
boy
tooth
and
the
pretty
new
blouse
which
she
had
put
on
in
his
honor
and
the
rose
in
her
bosom
taken
from
the
bunch
he
had
sent
to
greet
her
arrival
in
the
flat
the
night
before
and
after
he
had
heard
of
the
valorous
adventure
of
madame
bolivard
and
of
a
message
from
hégisippe
cruchot
which
she
had
forgotten
to
deliver
overnight
and
of
an
announcement
from
zora
to
the
effect
that
she
would
call
at
ecclefechan
mansions
soon
after
lunch
and
of
many
things
of
infinite
importance
emmy
asked
him
what
clem
sypher
had
been
doing
and
wherein
lay
the
particular
magnificence
of
character
to
which
septimus
had
alluded
he
awfully
splendid
said
septimus
he
has
given
up
a
fortune
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
he
also
gave
me
an
umbrella
and
his
blessing
emmy
he
looked
at
her
in
sudden
alarm
did
i
bring
an
umbrella
with
me
you
did
dear
and
you
put
it
in
the
stand
but
what
you
done
with
the
blessing
i
do
know
i
got
it
in
my
heart
said
he
he
a
tremendous
chap
emmy
curiosity
was
excited
she
sat
on
the
fender
seat
and
bent
forward
her
hands
on
her
knees
in
a
pretty
girlish
attitude
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
tell
me
all
about
it
he
obeyed
and
expounded
sypher
quixotism
in
his
roundabout
fashion
he
concluded
by
showing
her
how
it
had
been
done
for
zora
sake
emmy
made
a
little
gesture
of
impatience
zora
she
exclaimed
jealously
it
always
zora
to
see
how
you
men
go
on
one
would
think
there
was
no
other
woman
in
the
world
every
one
does
crazy
things
for
her
and
she
looks
on
calmly
and
never
does
a
hand
turn
for
anybody
clem
sypher
a
jolly
sight
too
good
for
her
septimus
looked
pained
at
the
disparagement
of
his
goddess
emmy
sprang
to
her
feet
and
put
her
on
his
shoulders
forgive
me
dear
women
are
cats
i
often
told
you
and
love
to
scratch
even
those
they
fond
of
sometimes
the
more
they
love
them
the
harder
they
scratch
but
i
wo
scratch
you
any
more
indeed
i
wo
the
sound
of
the
was
heard
in
the
front
door
there
madame
bolivard
she
cried
i
must
see
what
miracle
of
loaves
and
fishes
she
has
performed
do
mind
baby
till
i
come
back
she
danced
out
of
the
room
and
septimus
sat
on
a
chair
beside
the
bassinette
the
baby
he
was
a
rather
delicate
child
considerably
undergrown
for
his
age
but
a
placid
uncomplaining
little
mortal
looked
at
septimus
out
of
his
blue
and
white
china
eyes
and
contorted
his
features
into
a
muddle
indicative
of
pleasure
and
septimus
smiled
cordially
at
the
baby
william
octavius
oldrieve
dix
he
murmured
an
apostrophe
which
caused
the
future
statesman
a
paroxysm
of
amusement
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
you
like
london
we
great
friends
are
we
and
when
you
grow
up
we
going
to
be
greater
i
do
want
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
machinery
it
stops
your
heart
beating
and
makes
you
cold
and
unsympathetic
and
prevents
women
from
loving
you
you
must
invent
things
that
why
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
member
of
parliament
a
conservative
member
william
octavius
who
had
been
listening
attentively
suddenly
chuckled
as
if
he
had
seen
a
joke
septimus
gaze
conveyed
sedate
reproof
when
you
laugh
you
show
such
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
gum
like
wiggleswick
said
he
the
baby
made
no
reply
the
conversation
languished
septimus
bent
down
to
examine
the
tooth
and
the
baby
clutched
a
tiny
fistful
of
upstanding
hair
as
a
reaper
clutches
a
handful
of
wheat
septimus
smiled
and
kissed
the
little
crinkled
bubbly
lips
and
fell
into
a
reverie
william
octavius
went
fast
asleep
when
emmy
returned
she
caught
an
appealing
glance
from
septimus
and
rescued
him
a
new
absalom
you
dear
thing
she
cried
why
did
you
do
it
yourself
i
was
afraid
of
waking
him
it
dangerous
to
wake
babies
suddenly
no
it
is
babies
it
somnambulists
but
he
may
be
one
you
see
and
as
he
ca
walk
we
ca
tell
i
wonder
whether
i
could
invent
an
apparatus
for
preventing
somnambulists
from
doing
themselves
damage
emmy
laughed
you
can
invent
nothing
so
wonderful
as
madame
bolivard
she
cried
gaily
she
is
contemptuous
of
the
dangers
of
english
marketing
people
understood
me
at
once
she
said
she
evidently
has
a
poor
opinion
of
them
septimus
stayed
to
lunch
a
pleasant
meal
which
made
them
bless
hégisippe
cruchot
for
introducing
them
to
the
aunt
who
could
cook
so
far
did
their
gratitude
go
that
septimus
remarked
that
it
would
only
be
decent
to
add
hégisippe
to
the
baby
names
but
emmy
observed
that
he
should
have
thought
of
that
before
the
boy
had
already
been
christened
it
was
too
late
they
drank
the
zouave
health
instead
in
some
fearful
and
wonderful
red
wine
which
madame
bolivard
had
procured
from
heaven
knows
what
purveyor
of
dangerous
chemicals
they
thought
it
excellent
i
wonder
said
emmy
whether
you
know
what
this
means
to
me
it
home
replied
septimus
with
an
approving
glance
around
the
little
you
must
get
me
a
flat
just
like
this
close
by
if
it
too
close
i
might
come
here
too
often
do
you
think
that
possible
she
said
with
as
much
wistfulness
as
she
dare
allow
herself
besides
you
have
a
right
septimus
explained
that
as
a
master
of
arts
of
the
university
of
cambridge
he
had
a
right
to
play
marbles
on
the
senate
house
steps
a
privilege
denied
by
statute
to
persons
statu
but
that
he
would
be
locked
up
as
a
lunatic
if
he
insisted
on
exercising
it
after
a
pause
emmy
looked
at
him
and
said
with
sudden
tragicality
i
not
a
horrible
hateful
worry
to
you
septimus
lord
no
said
septimus
you
do
wish
you
had
never
set
eyes
on
me
my
dear
girl
said
septimus
and
you
would
rather
go
on
living
quietly
at
nunsmere
and
not
bother
about
me
any
more
do
tell
me
the
truth
septimus
hand
went
to
his
hair
he
was
unversed
in
the
ways
of
women
i
thought
all
that
was
settled
long
ago
he
said
i
such
a
useless
creature
you
give
me
something
to
think
about
and
the
boy
and
his
education
and
his
teeth
and
he
have
whooping
cough
and
measles
and
breeches
and
things
and
it
will
be
frightfully
interesting
emmy
elbow
on
table
and
chin
in
hand
smiled
at
him
with
a
touch
of
audacity
in
her
eyes
i
believe
you
more
interested
in
the
boy
than
you
are
in
me
septimus
reddened
and
stammered
unable
as
usual
to
express
his
feelings
he
kept
to
the
question
of
interest
it
so
different
said
he
i
look
on
the
boy
as
a
kind
of
invention
she
persisted
and
what
am
i
he
had
one
of
his
luminous
inspirations
you
said
he
are
a
discovery
emmy
laughed
i
do
believe
you
like
me
a
little
bit
after
all
you
got
such
beautiful
said
he
madame
bolivard
brought
in
the
coffee
septimus
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
cup
from
tray
to
table
let
it
fall
through
his
nervous
fingers
and
the
coffee
streamed
over
the
dainty
madame
bolivard
appealed
fervently
to
the
deity
but
emmy
smiled
proudly
as
if
the
spilling
of
coffee
was
a
rare
social
accomplishment
soon
after
this
septimus
went
to
his
club
with
orders
to
return
for
tea
leaving
emmy
to
prepare
for
her
meeting
with
zora
he
had
offered
to
be
present
at
this
first
interview
so
as
to
give
her
his
support
and
corroborate
whatever
statement
as
to
his
turpitudes
she
might
care
to
make
in
explanation
of
their
decision
to
live
apart
but
emmy
preferred
to
fight
her
battle
alone
he
had
saved
the
situation
by
his
very
vagueness
in
conjunction
with
herself
there
was
no
knowing
what
he
might
do
for
she
had
resolved
to
exonerate
him
from
all
blame
and
to
attribute
to
her
own
infirmities
of
disposition
this
calamitous
result
of
their
marriage
now
that
the
hour
of
meeting
approached
she
grew
nervous
unlike
zora
she
had
not
inherited
her
father
fearlessness
and
joy
of
battle
the
touch
of
adventurous
spirit
which
she
had
received
from
him
had
been
her
undoing
as
it
had
led
her
into
temptation
which
the
gentle
weak
character
derived
from
her
mother
had
been
powerless
to
resist
all
her
life
she
had
been
afraid
of
zora
subdued
by
her
splendid
vitality
humbled
before
her
more
generous
accomplishment
and
now
she
was
to
fight
for
her
honor
and
her
child
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
tender
chivalry
of
the
odd
beloved
creature
that
was
her
husband
she
armed
herself
with
woman
weapons
and
put
on
a
brave
face
though
her
heart
thumped
like
some
devilish
machine
racking
her
mercilessly
the
bell
rang
she
bent
over
the
boy
asleep
in
the
bassinette
and
gave
a
mother
touch
or
two
to
the
tiny
coverlet
she
heard
the
flat
door
open
and
zora
rich
voice
inquire
for
dix
then
zora
splendid
deep
bosomed
glowing
with
color
bringing
with
her
a
perfume
of
furs
and
violets
sailed
into
the
room
and
took
her
into
her
arms
emmy
felt
fluffy
and
insignificant
how
well
you
looking
dear
i
declare
you
are
prettier
than
ever
you
filled
out
i
did
come
the
first
thing
this
morning
as
i
wanted
to
because
i
knew
you
would
find
everything
in
the
flat
septimus
is
a
dear
but
i
have
much
faith
in
his
domestic
capabilities
the
flat
was
in
perfect
order
said
emmy
even
that
bunch
of
roses
in
a
jar
did
he
remember
to
put
in
the
water
zora
laughed
meaning
to
be
kind
and
generous
to
make
it
evident
to
emmy
that
she
had
not
come
as
a
violent
partisan
of
septimus
and
to
lay
a
pleasant
familiar
foundation
for
the
discussion
in
prospect
but
emmy
resented
the
note
of
disparagement
of
course
he
did
she
said
shortly
zora
flew
to
the
bassinette
and
glowed
womanlike
over
the
baby
a
beautiful
child
one
to
be
proud
of
indeed
why
had
emmy
dear
proclaimed
his
uniqueness
in
the
world
of
infants
from
the
references
in
her
letters
he
might
have
been
the
ordinary
baby
of
every
cradle
oh
you
ought
to
be
such
a
happy
woman
she
cried
taking
off
her
furs
and
throwing
them
over
the
back
of
a
chair
such
a
happy
woman
an
involuntary
sigh
shook
her
the
first
words
had
been
intended
to
convey
a
gentle
reproof
nature
had
compelled
the
reiteration
on
her
own
account
i
happy
enough
said
emmy
i
wish
you
could
say
that
with
more
conviction
dear
generally
means
miserable
why
should
you
be
miserable
i
not
i
have
more
happiness
than
i
deserve
i
do
deserve
much
zora
put
her
arm
round
her
sister
waist
never
mind
dear
we
try
to
make
you
happier
emmy
submitted
to
the
caress
for
a
while
and
then
freed
herself
gently
she
did
not
reply
not
all
the
trying
of
zora
and
all
the
ladies
bountiful
of
christendom
could
give
her
her
heart
desire
besides
zora
with
her
large
air
of
smiling
ex
was
hopelessly
out
of
tone
with
her
mood
she
picked
up
the
furs
how
lovely
they
new
where
did
you
get
them
the
talk
turned
on
ordinary
topics
they
had
not
met
for
a
year
and
they
spoke
of
trivial
happenings
emmy
touched
lightly
on
her
life
in
paris
they
exchanged
information
as
to
their
respective
journeys
emmy
had
had
a
good
crossing
the
day
before
but
madame
bolivard
who
had
faced
the
hitherto
unknown
perils
of
the
deep
with
unflinching
courage
had
been
dreadfully
seasick
the
boy
had
slept
most
of
the
time
awake
he
had
been
as
good
as
gold
he
the
sweetest
tempered
child
under
the
sun
like
his
father
said
zora
who
is
both
sweet
tempered
and
a
child
the
words
were
a
dagger
in
emmy
heart
she
turned
away
swiftly
lest
zora
should
see
the
pain
in
her
eyes
the
intensity
of
the
agony
had
been
unforeseen
i
hope
the
little
mite
has
a
spice
of
the
devil
from
our
side
of
the
family
added
zora
or
it
will
go
hard
with
him
that
what
wrong
with
poor
septimus
emmy
turned
with
a
flash
there
nothing
wrong
with
septimus
i
change
him
for
any
man
in
the
world
zora
raised
surprised
eyebrows
and
made
the
obvious
retort
then
my
dear
why
on
earth
do
you
live
with
him
emmy
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
block
of
flats
over
the
way
and
a
young
woman
at
a
window
immediately
opposite
was
also
looking
out
this
irritated
her
she
resented
being
stared
at
by
a
young
woman
in
a
flat
she
left
the
window
and
sat
on
the
sofa
do
you
think
zora
you
might
let
septimus
and
myself
arrange
things
as
we
think
best
i
assure
you
we
are
quite
capable
of
looking
after
ourselves
we
meet
in
the
friendliest
way
possible
but
we
have
decided
to
occupy
separate
houses
it
a
matter
that
concerns
ourselves
entirely
zora
was
prepared
for
this
attitude
which
she
had
resolved
not
to
countenance
she
had
come
in
all
her
bravery
to
bring
emmy
to
her
senses
emmy
should
be
brought
she
left
the
bassinette
and
sat
down
near
her
sister
and
smiled
indulgently
my
dearest
child
if
you
were
people
and
held
all
sorts
of
outrageous
views
i
might
understand
you
but
you
are
two
very
ordinary
folk
with
no
views
at
all
you
never
had
any
in
your
life
and
if
septimus
had
one
he
would
be
so
terribly
afraid
of
it
that
he
would
chain
it
up
i
quite
certain
you
married
without
any
idea
save
that
of
sticking
together
now
why
have
you
i
make
septimus
miserable
i
ca
help
it
sooner
than
make
him
unhappy
i
insist
upon
this
arrangement
there
then
i
think
you
are
very
wicked
and
heartless
and
selfish
said
zora
i
am
said
emmy
defiantly
your
duty
is
to
make
him
happy
it
would
take
so
little
to
do
that
you
ought
to
give
him
a
comfortable
home
and
teach
him
to
realize
his
responsibilities
toward
the
child
again
the
stab
emmy
nerve
began
to
give
way
for
the
first
time
came
the
wild
notion
of
facing
zora
with
the
whole
disastrous
story
she
dismissed
it
as
crazy
i
tell
you
things
ca
be
altered
but
why
i
ca
imagine
you
so
monstrous
give
me
your
confidence
darling
there
nothing
to
give
i
sure
i
could
put
things
right
for
you
at
once
if
i
knew
what
was
wrong
if
it
anything
to
do
with
septimus
she
added
in
her
unwisdom
and
with
a
charming
proprietary
smile
why
i
can
make
him
do
whatever
i
like
even
if
we
had
quarreled
cried
emmy
losing
control
of
her
prudence
do
you
suppose
i
would
let
bring
him
back
to
me
but
why
not
have
you
been
so
blind
all
this
time
as
not
to
see
emmy
knew
her
words
were
vain
and
dangerous
but
the
attitude
of
her
sister
calm
and
confident
assuming
her
air
of
gracious
patronage
irritated
her
beyond
endurance
zora
smile
deepened
into
indulgent
laughter
my
dearest
emmy
you
do
mean
to
say
that
it
jealousy
of
me
but
too
ridiculous
do
you
suppose
i
ever
thought
of
septimus
in
that
way
you
thought
of
him
just
as
you
used
to
think
of
the
sheep
dog
we
had
when
we
were
children
well
dear
you
were
never
jealous
of
my
attachment
to
bobbie
or
devotion
to
me
said
zora
smilingly
logical
come
dear
i
knew
there
was
only
some
silly
nonsense
at
the
bottom
of
this
look
i
resign
every
right
i
have
in
poor
septimus
emmy
rose
if
you
call
him
septimus
and
speak
of
him
in
that
tone
you
drive
me
mad
it
you
that
are
wicked
and
heartless
and
selfish
i
cried
zora
aghast
yes
you
you
accept
the
love
and
adoration
of
the
noblest
gentleman
that
god
ever
put
into
the
world
and
you
treat
him
and
talk
of
him
as
if
he
were
a
creature
of
no
account
if
you
were
worthy
of
being
loved
by
him
i
should
he
jealous
but
you
not
you
been
so
wrapped
up
in
your
own
magnificence
that
you
not
even
condescended
to
notice
that
he
loved
you
and
even
now
when
i
tell
you
you
laugh
as
if
it
were
preposterous
that
septimus
could
ever
dare
to
love
you
you
drive
me
mad
zora
drew
herself
up
angrily
to
make
allowances
for
a
silly
jealousy
was
one
thing
it
was
another
to
be
accused
in
this
vehement
fashion
conscious
of
her
innocence
she
said
your
attack
on
me
is
entirely
unjustifiable
emmy
i
have
done
nothing
that
why
retorted
emmy
quickly
you
done
nothing
men
are
sacrificing
their
lives
and
fortunes
for
you
and
you
do
nothing
lives
and
fortunes
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
say
cried
emmy
desperately
septimus
has
done
everything
short
of
laying
down
his
life
for
you
and
that
he
would
have
done
if
necessary
and
you
have
even
taken
the
trouble
to
see
the
soul
in
the
man
that
was
capable
of
it
and
now
that
something
has
happened
which
you
ca
help
seeing
you
come
in
your
grand
way
to
put
it
all
to
rights
in
a
minute
you
think
i
turned
him
out
because
he
a
worry
like
bobbie
the
sheep
dog
and
you
say
fellow
see
how
pitifully
he
wagging
his
tail
it
cruel
of
you
not
to
let
him
in
that
the
way
you
look
at
septimus
and
i
ca
stand
it
and
i
wo
i
love
him
as
i
never
dreamed
a
woman
could
love
a
man
i
could
tear
myself
into
little
pieces
for
him
bit
by
bit
and
i
ca
get
him
he
as
far
removed
from
me
as
the
stars
in
heaven
you
could
never
understand
i
pray
every
night
to
god
to
forgive
me
and
to
work
a
miracle
and
bring
him
to
me
but
miracles
do
happen
he
never
come
to
me
he
ca
come
to
me
while
you
have
been
patronizing
him
patting
him
on
the
head
playing
lady
bountiful
to
him
as
you
are
doing
to
the
other
man
who
has
given
up
a
fortune
this
very
morning
just
because
he
loves
you
while
you
been
doing
this
and
despising
him
yes
you
know
you
do
in
your
heart
for
a
simple
creature
who
amuses
himself
with
crazy
inventions
he
has
done
a
thing
to
save
you
from
pain
and
shame
and
sorrow
you
not
me
because
he
loved
you
and
now
i
love
him
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
life
for
the
miracle
to
happen
but
it
ca
do
you
understand
it
ca
she
stood
panting
in
front
of
zora
a
passionate
woman
obeying
elemental
laws
and
when
passionate
women
obey
elemental
laws
they
are
reckless
in
speech
and
overwhelming
in
assertion
and
denunciation
emmy
was
the
first
whom
zora
had
encountered
she
was
bewildered
by
the
storm
of
words
and
could
only
say
rather
stupidly
why
ca
it
emmy
thew
two
or
three
short
breaths
the
notion
had
come
again
the
temptation
was
irresistible
zora
should
know
having
brought
it
on
herself
she
opened
the
door
madame
bolivard
she
cried
and
when
the
frenchwoman
appeared
she
pointed
to
the
bassinette
take
baby
into
the
bedroom
it
will
be
better
for
him
there
said
madame
bolivard
taking
up
the
child
and
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
emmy
pointed
to
it
and
said
that
why
zora
started
forward
horror
stricken
emmy
what
do
you
mean
i
tell
you
i
could
with
him
in
the
room
i
should
always
fancy
that
he
had
heard
me
and
i
want
him
to
respect
and
love
his
mother
emmy
cried
zora
emmy
what
are
you
saying
your
son
not
respect
you
if
he
knew
do
you
mean
yes
said
emmy
i
do
septimus
went
through
the
marriage
ceremony
with
me
and
gave
us
his
name
that
why
we
are
living
apart
now
you
know
my
god
said
zora
do
you
remember
the
last
night
i
was
at
nunsmere
yes
you
fainted
i
had
seen
the
announcement
of
the
man
marriage
in
the
newspaper
she
told
her
story
briefly
and
defiantly
asking
for
no
sympathy
proclaiming
it
all
majorem
septimi
zora
sat
looking
at
her
paralyzed
with
helplessness
like
one
who
having
gone
lightly
forth
to
shoot
rabbits
suddenly
comes
upon
a
lion
why
did
you
tell
me
at
the
time
before
did
you
ever
encourage
me
to
give
you
my
confidence
you
patted
me
on
the
head
too
and
never
concerned
yourself
about
my
affairs
i
was
afraid
of
you
deadly
afraid
of
you
it
sounds
rather
silly
now
does
it
but
i
was
zora
made
no
protest
against
the
accusation
she
sat
quite
still
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
foot
of
the
bassinette
adjusting
her
soul
to
new
and
startling
conceptions
she
said
in
a
whisper
my
god
what
a
fool
i
been
the
words
lingered
a
haunting
echo
in
her
ears
they
were
mockingly
familiar
where
had
she
heard
them
recently
suddenly
she
remembered
she
raised
her
head
and
glanced
at
emmy
in
anything
but
a
proud
way
you
said
something
just
now
about
clem
sypher
having
sacrificed
a
fortune
for
me
what
was
it
i
had
better
hear
everything
emmy
sat
on
the
fender
stool
as
she
had
done
when
septimus
had
told
her
the
story
and
repeated
it
for
zora
benefit
you
say
he
sent
for
septimus
this
morning
said
zora
in
a
low
voice
do
you
think
he
knows
about
you
two
it
is
possible
that
he
guesses
replied
emmy
to
whom
hégisippe
indiscretion
had
been
reported
septimus
has
not
told
him
i
ask
said
zora
because
since
my
return
he
has
seemed
to
look
on
septimus
as
a
sort
of
inspired
creature
i
begin
to
see
things
i
never
saw
before
there
was
silence
emmy
gripped
the
mantelpiece
and
head
on
arm
looked
into
the
fire
zora
sat
lost
in
her
expanding
vision
presently
emmy
said
without
turning
round
you
must
turn
away
from
me
now
for
septimus
sake
he
loves
the
boy
as
if
he
were
his
own
whatever
wrong
i
done
i
suffered
for
it
once
i
was
a
frivolous
unbalanced
unprincipled
little
fool
i
a
woman
now
and
a
good
woman
thanks
to
him
to
live
in
the
same
atmosphere
as
that
exquisite
delicacy
of
soul
is
enough
to
make
one
good
no
other
man
on
earth
could
have
done
what
he
has
done
and
in
the
way
he
has
done
it
i
ca
help
loving
him
i
ca
help
eating
my
heart
out
for
him
that
my
punishment
this
time
the
succeeding
silence
was
broken
by
a
sob
emmy
started
round
and
beheld
zora
crying
silently
to
herself
among
the
sofa
cushions
emmy
was
amazed
zora
the
magnificent
had
broken
down
and
was
weeping
like
any
silly
fool
of
a
girl
it
was
real
crying
not
the
shedding
of
the
tears
of
sensibility
which
often
stood
in
her
generous
eyes
emmy
moved
gently
across
the
room
she
was
a
affectionate
woman
and
knelt
by
the
sofa
zora
dear
zora
with
an
immense
longing
for
love
caught
her
sister
in
her
arms
and
the
two
women
wept
very
happily
together
it
was
thus
that
septimus
returning
for
tea
as
he
was
bidden
found
them
some
while
afterwards
zora
rose
her
lashes
still
wet
and
whipped
up
her
furs
but
you
not
going
yes
i
leave
you
two
together
i
do
what
i
can
septimus
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
emmy
has
told
me
everything
oh
you
need
look
frightened
dear
i
not
going
to
thank
you
her
voice
broke
on
the
laugh
i
should
only
make
a
fool
of
myself
some
other
time
i
only
want
to
say
do
you
think
you
would
be
more
more
cosy
and
comfortable
if
you
let
her
take
care
of
you
altogether
she
breaking
her
heart
for
love
of
you
septimus
and
she
would
make
you
happy
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
before
the
pair
could
recover
from
their
confusion
they
heard
the
flat
door
slam
behind
her
emmy
looked
at
septimus
with
a
great
scare
in
her
blue
eyes
she
said
something
about
taking
no
notice
of
what
zora
said
but
is
it
true
he
asked
she
said
with
her
back
against
the
wall
do
you
think
it
very
amazing
that
i
should
care
for
you
septimus
ran
his
hands
vehemently
up
his
hair
till
it
reached
the
climax
of
struwel
peterdom
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
his
life
had
happened
a
woman
loved
him
it
upset
all
his
preconceived
notions
of
his
place
in
the
universe
yes
i
do
he
answered
it
makes
my
head
spin
round
he
found
himself
close
to
her
do
you
mean
that
you
love
me
his
voice
grew
tremulous
as
if
i
were
an
ordinary
man
no
she
cried
with
a
half
laugh
of
course
i
do
how
could
i
love
an
ordinary
man
as
i
love
you
neither
could
tell
afterwards
how
it
happened
emmy
called
the
walls
to
witness
that
she
did
not
throw
herself
into
his
arms
and
natural
timidity
precluded
the
possibility
of
his
having
seized
her
in
his
but
she
stood
for
a
long
throbbing
time
in
his
embrace
while
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
gave
all
his
heart
into
her
keeping
they
sat
down
together
on
the
fender
seat
when
a
man
does
that
said
septimus
as
if
struck
by
a
luminous
idea
i
suppose
he
asks
the
girl
to
marry
him
but
we
are
married
already
she
cried
joyously
dear
me
said
septimus
so
we
are
i
forgot
it
very
puzzling
it
i
think
if
you
do
mind
i
kiss
you
again
chapter
xxiii
zora
went
straight
back
to
her
hotel
there
without
taking
off
her
hat
or
furs
she
wrote
a
swift
long
letter
to
clem
sypher
and
summoning
the
waiter
ordered
him
to
post
it
at
once
when
he
had
gone
she
reflected
for
a
few
moments
and
sent
off
a
telegram
after
a
further
brief
period
of
reflection
she
went
and
rang
up
sypher
office
on
the
telephone
the
mere
man
would
have
tried
the
telephone
first
then
sent
the
telegram
and
after
that
the
explanatory
letter
woman
has
her
own
way
of
doing
things
sypher
was
in
he
would
have
finished
for
the
day
in
about
twenty
minutes
then
he
would
come
to
her
on
the
nearest
approach
to
wings
london
locomotion
provided
remember
it
something
most
particular
that
i
want
to
see
you
about
said
zora
she
rang
off
and
went
again
removed
the
traces
of
tears
from
her
face
and
changed
her
dress
for
a
few
moments
she
regarded
her
outward
semblance
somewhat
anxiously
in
the
glass
unconscious
of
a
new
coquetry
then
she
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
looked
at
the
inner
zora
middlemist
there
was
never
woman
since
the
world
began
more
cast
down
from
her
high
estate
not
a
shred
of
magnificence
remained
she
saw
herself
as
the
most
useless
vaporing
and
purblind
of
mortals
she
had
gone
forth
from
the
despised
nunsmere
where
nothing
ever
happened
to
travel
the
world
over
in
search
of
realities
and
had
returned
to
find
that
nunsmere
had
all
the
time
been
the
center
of
the
realities
that
most
deeply
concerned
her
life
while
she
had
been
talking
others
had
been
living
the
three
beings
whom
she
had
honored
with
her
royal
and
somewhat
condescending
affection
had
all
done
great
things
passed
through
flames
and
issued
thence
purified
with
love
in
their
hearts
emmy
septimus
sypher
all
in
their
respective
ways
had
grappled
with
essentials
she
alone
had
done
nothing
she
the
strong
the
sane
the
capable
the
magnificent
she
had
been
a
tinsel
failure
so
far
out
of
touch
had
she
been
with
the
real
warm
things
of
life
which
mattered
that
she
had
not
even
gained
her
sister
confidence
had
she
done
so
from
her
girlhood
up
the
miserable
tragedy
might
not
have
happened
she
had
failed
in
a
sister
elementary
duty
as
a
six
weeks
wife
what
had
she
done
save
shiver
with
a
splendid
disgust
another
woman
would
have
fought
and
perhaps
have
conquered
she
had
made
no
attempt
and
the
poor
wretch
dead
she
had
trumpeted
abroad
her
crude
opinion
of
the
sex
to
which
he
belonged
at
every
turn
she
had
seen
it
refuted
for
many
months
she
had
known
it
to
be
vain
and
false
and
nature
who
with
all
her
faults
is
at
least
not
a
liar
had
spoken
over
and
over
again
she
had
raised
a
fine
storm
of
argument
but
nature
had
laughed
so
had
the
literary
man
from
london
she
had
a
salutary
vision
of
herself
as
the
common
geck
and
gull
of
the
queerly
assorted
pair
she
recognized
that
in
order
to
work
out
any
problem
of
life
one
must
accept
life
postulates
and
axioms
even
her
mother
from
whose
gentle
lips
she
rarely
expected
to
hear
wisdom
had
said
i
do
see
how
you
going
to
dear
without
a
man
to
take
care
of
you
her
mother
was
right
nature
was
right
rattenden
was
right
she
zora
middlemist
had
been
hopelessly
wrong
when
sypher
arrived
she
welcomed
him
with
an
unaccustomed
the
masterful
grip
of
his
hands
as
they
held
hers
gave
her
a
new
throb
of
pleasure
she
glanced
into
his
eyes
and
saw
there
the
steady
love
of
a
strong
clean
soul
she
glanced
away
and
hung
her
head
feeling
unworthy
what
this
most
particular
thing
you
have
to
say
to
me
he
asked
with
a
smile
i
ca
tell
it
to
you
like
this
let
us
sit
down
draw
up
that
chair
to
the
fire
when
they
were
seated
she
said
i
want
first
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
do
you
know
why
septimus
married
my
sister
be
quite
frank
for
i
know
everything
yes
he
said
gravely
i
knew
i
found
it
out
in
one
or
two
odd
ways
septimus
has
the
faintest
idea
zora
picked
up
an
illustrated
weekly
from
the
floor
and
used
it
as
a
screen
ostensibly
from
the
fire
really
from
sypher
why
did
you
refuse
the
jebusa
jones
offer
this
morning
what
would
you
have
thought
of
me
if
i
had
accepted
but
septimus
should
have
told
you
he
did
he
told
emmy
who
told
me
you
did
it
for
my
sake
everything
i
do
is
for
your
sake
you
know
that
well
enough
why
did
you
send
for
septimus
why
are
you
putting
me
through
this
interrogatory
he
laughed
you
will
learn
soon
said
zora
i
want
to
get
everything
clear
in
my
mind
i
had
a
great
shock
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
beaten
all
over
for
the
first
time
i
recognize
the
truth
of
the
proverb
about
a
woman
a
dog
and
a
walnut
tree
why
did
you
send
for
septimus
sypher
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
as
the
illustrated
paper
prevented
him
from
seeing
zora
face
he
looked
reflectively
at
the
fire
i
always
told
you
that
i
am
superstitious
septimus
seems
to
be
gifted
with
an
unconscious
sense
of
right
in
an
infinitely
higher
degree
than
any
man
i
have
ever
known
his
dealings
with
emmy
showed
it
his
sending
for
you
to
help
me
showed
it
he
has
shown
it
in
a
thousand
ways
if
it
been
for
him
and
his
influence
on
my
mind
i
do
think
i
should
have
come
to
that
decision
when
i
had
come
to
it
i
just
wanted
him
why
i
tell
you
i
suppose
you
knew
that
he
was
in
love
with
me
said
zora
in
the
same
even
tone
yes
said
sypher
that
why
he
married
your
sister
do
you
know
why
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
sent
me
the
tail
of
the
little
dog
he
knew
somehow
that
it
was
right
i
believe
it
was
i
tell
you
superstitious
but
in
what
absolute
way
it
was
right
i
ca
imagine
i
can
said
zora
he
knew
that
my
place
was
by
your
side
he
knew
that
i
cared
for
you
more
than
for
any
man
alive
she
paused
then
she
said
deliberately
he
knew
that
i
loved
you
all
the
time
sypher
plucked
the
illustrated
paper
from
her
hand
and
cast
it
across
the
room
and
bending
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
seized
her
wrist
zora
do
you
mean
that
she
nodded
fluttered
a
glance
at
him
and
put
out
her
free
hand
to
claim
a
few
moments
grace
i
left
you
to
look
for
a
mission
in
life
i
come
back
and
found
it
at
the
place
i
started
from
it
a
big
mission
for
it
means
being
a
mate
to
a
big
man
but
if
you
will
let
me
try
i
do
my
best
sypher
thrust
away
the
protecting
hand
you
can
talk
afterwards
he
said
thus
did
zora
come
to
the
knowledge
of
things
real
when
the
gates
were
opened
she
walked
in
with
a
tread
not
wanting
in
magnificence
she
made
the
great
surrender
which
is
woman
greatest
victory
very
proudly
very
humbly
very
deliciously
she
had
her
greatnesses
she
freed
herself
flushed
and
trembling
throbbing
with
a
strange
happiness
that
caught
her
breath
this
time
she
believed
nature
and
laughed
with
her
in
her
heart
in
close
companionship
she
was
mere
woman
after
all
with
no
mission
in
life
but
the
accomplishment
of
her
womanhood
and
she
gloried
in
the
knowledge
this
was
exceedingly
good
for
her
sypher
regarded
her
with
shining
eyes
as
if
she
had
been
an
immortal
vesting
herself
in
human
clay
for
divine
love
of
him
and
this
was
exceedingly
good
for
sypher
after
much
hyperbole
they
descended
to
kindly
commonplace
but
i
do
see
now
he
cried
how
i
can
ask
you
to
marry
me
i
even
know
how
i
to
earn
my
living
there
are
septimus
inventions
have
you
lost
your
faith
in
them
he
cried
with
sudden
enthusiasm
as
who
should
say
if
an
immortal
has
faith
in
them
then
indeed
must
they
be
divine
do
you
believe
in
them
now
utterly
i
grown
superstitious
too
wherever
we
turn
there
is
septimus
he
has
raised
emmy
from
hell
to
heaven
he
has
brought
us
two
together
he
is
our
guardian
angel
he
never
fail
us
oh
clem
thank
heaven
she
exclaimed
fervently
i
got
something
to
believe
in
at
last
meanwhile
the
guardian
angel
entirely
unconscious
of
apotheosis
sat
in
the
little
flat
in
chelsea
blissfully
eating
crumpets
over
which
emmy
had
spread
the
preposterous
amount
of
butter
which
proceeds
from
an
overflowing
heart
she
knelt
on
the
hearth
rug
watching
him
adoringly
as
if
he
were
a
hierophant
eating
sacramental
wafer
they
talked
of
the
future
he
mentioned
the
nice
houses
he
had
seen
in
berkeley
square
berkeley
square
would
be
very
charming
said
emmy
but
it
would
mean
carriages
and
and
powdered
footmen
and
ascot
and
balls
and
dinner
parties
and
presentations
at
court
you
would
be
just
in
your
element
would
you
dear
she
laughed
and
laid
her
happy
head
on
his
knee
no
dear
if
we
want
to
have
a
fling
together
you
and
i
in
london
let
us
keep
on
this
flat
as
a
but
let
us
live
at
nunsmere
the
house
is
quite
big
enough
and
if
it
is
you
can
always
add
on
a
bit
at
the
cost
of
a
month
rent
in
berkeley
square
would
you
prefer
to
live
at
nunsmere
you
and
the
boy
and
my
workshop
are
all
i
want
in
the
world
said
he
and
not
wiggleswick
one
of
his
rare
smiles
passed
across
his
face
i
think
wiggleswick
will
be
upset
emmy
laughed
again
what
a
funny
household
it
will
be
wiggleswick
and
madame
bolivard
it
will
be
lovely
septimus
reflected
for
an
anxious
moment
do
you
know
dear
he
said
diffidently
i
dreamed
of
something
all
my
life
i
mean
ever
since
i
left
home
it
has
always
seemed
somehow
beyond
my
reach
i
wonder
whether
it
can
come
true
now
so
many
wonderful
things
have
happened
to
me
that
perhaps
this
too
what
is
it
dear
she
asked
very
softly
i
seem
to
be
so
marked
off
from
other
men
but
i
dreamed
all
my
life
of
having
in
my
house
a
neat
proper
real
parlor
maid
in
a
pretty
white
cap
and
apron
do
you
think
it
can
be
managed
with
her
head
on
his
knee
she
said
in
a
queer
voice
yes
i
think
it
can
he
touched
her
cheek
and
suddenly
drew
his
hand
away
why
you
crying
what
a
selfish
brute
i
am
of
course
we
wo
have
her
if
she
would
be
in
your
way
emmy
lifted
her
face
to
him
oh
you
dear
beautiful
silly
septimus
she
said
do
you
understand
is
it
just
like
you
you
give
every
one
else
the
earth
and
in
return
you
ask
for
a
parlor
maid
well
you
see
he
said
in
a
tone
of
distressed
apology
she
would
come
in
so
handy
i
could
teach
her
to
mind
the
guns
you
dear
cried
emmy
the
end
